To	1

Flowers	1

That	1

Triumph	1
ouer	1

blood?	1
Be	1
gone,	1
Runne	1
to	1
your	1
houses,	1
fall	1
vpon	1
your	1
knees,	1
Pray	1
to	1
the	1
Gods	1
to	1
intermit	1
the	1
plague	1
That	1
needs	1

light	1

Ingratitude	1
Fla.	1
Go,	1

and	1
for	1
this	1
fault	1
Assemble	1
all	1
the	1
poore	1

Draw	1

Tyber	1
bankes,	1
and	1
weepe	1
your	1

Into	1
the	1
Channell,	1

Do	1

This	1

You	1

It	1

Trophees:	1
Ile	1

And	1

So	1
do	1
you	1

where	1
you	1

them	1
thicke.	1
These	1
growing	1
Feathers,	1
pluckt	1
from	1
Caesars	1
wing,	1
Will	1
make	1

And	1

A	1

&	1
Cass.	1
Cassi.	1
Will	1
you	1
go	1
see	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
the	1
course?	1
Brut.	1
Not	1
I	1
Cassi.	1
I	1
pray	1
you	1
do	1
Brut.	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
Gamesom:	1
I	1
do	1
lacke	1
some	1
part	1
Of	1
that	1
quicke	1
Spirit	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
Antony:	1
Let	1
me	1
not	1
hinder	1
Cassius	1
your	1
desires;	1
Ile	1
leaue	1
you	1
Cassi.	1
Brutus,	1
I	1
do	1
obserue	1
you	1
now	1
of	1
late:	1
I	1
haue	1
not	1
from	1
your	1
eyes,	1
that	1
gentlenesse	1
And	1
shew	1
of	1
Loue,	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
wont	1
to	1
haue:	1
You	1
beare	1
too	1
stubborne,	1
and	1
too	1
strange	1
a	1
hand	1
Ouer	1
your	1
Friend,	1
that	1
loues	1
you	1
Bru.	1
Cassius,	1
Be	1
not	1
deceiu'd:	1
If	1
I	1
haue	1
veyl'd	1
my	1
looke,	1
I	1
turne	1
the	1
trouble	1
of	1
my	1
Countenance	1
Meerely	1
vpon	1
my	1
selfe.	1
Vexed	1
I	1
am	1
Of	1
late,	1
with	1
passions	1
of	1
some	1
difference,	1
Conceptions	1
onely	1
proper	1
to	1
my	1
selfe,	1
Which	1
giue	1
some	1
soyle	1
(perhaps)	1
to	1
my	1
Behauiours:	1
But	1
let	1
not	1
therefore	1
my	1
good	1
Friends	1
be	1
greeu'd	1
(Among	1
which	1
number	1
Cassius	1
be	1
you	1
one)	1
Nor	1
construe	1
any	1
further	1
my	1
neglect,	1
Then	1
that	1
poore	1
Brutus	1
with	1
himselfe	1
at	1
warre,	1
Forgets	1
the	1
shewes	1
of	1
Loue	1
to	1
other	1
men	1
Cassi.	1
Then	1
Brutus,	1
I	1
haue	1
much	1
mistook	1
your	1
passion,	1
By	1
meanes	1
whereof,	1
this	1
Brest	1
of	1
mine	1
hath	1
buried	1
Thoughts	1
of	1
great	1
value,	1
worthy	1
Cogitations.	1
Tell	1
me	1
good	1
Brutus,	1
Can	1
you	1
see	1
your	1
face?	1
Brutus.	1
No	1
Cassius:	1
For	1
the	1
eye	1
sees	1
not	1
it	1
selfe	1
but	1
by	1
reflection,	1
By	1
some	1
other	1
things	1
Cassius.	1
'Tis	1
iust,	1
And	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
much	1
lamented	1
Brutus,	1
That	1
you	1
haue	1
no	1
such	1
Mirrors,	1
as	1
will	1
turne	1
Your	1
hidden	1
worthinesse	1
into	1
your	1
eye,	1
That	1
you	1
might	1
see	1
your	1
shadow:	1
I	1
haue	1
heard,	1
Where	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
respect	1
in	1
Rome,	1
(Except	1
immortall	1
Caesar)	1
speaking	1
of	1
Brutus,	1
And	1
groaning	1
vnderneath	1
this	1
Ages	1
yoake,	1
Haue	1
wish'd,	1
that	1
Noble	1
Brutus	1
had	1
his	1
eyes	1
Bru.	1
Into	1
what	1
dangers,	1
would	1
you	1
Leade	1
me	1
Cassius?	1
That	1
you	1
would	1
haue	1
me	1
seeke	1
into	1
my	1
selfe,	1
For	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
me?	1
Cas.	1
Therefore	1
good	1
Brutus,	1
be	1
prepar'd	1
to	1
heare:	1
And	1
since	1
you	1
know,	1
you	1
cannot	1
see	1
your	1
selfe	1
So	1
well	1
as	1
by	1
Reflection;	1
I	1
your	1
Glasse,	1
Will	1
modestly	1
discouer	1
to	1
your	1
selfe	1
That	1
of	1
your	1
selfe,	1
which	1
you	1
yet	1
know	1
not	1
of.	1
And	1
be	1
not	1
iealous	1
on	1
me,	1
gentle	1
Brutus:	1
Were	1
I	1
a	1
common	1
Laughter,	1
or	1
did	1
vse	1
To	1
stale	1
with	1
ordinary	1
Oathes	1
my	1
loue	1
To	1
euery	1
new	1
Protester:	1
if	1
you	1
know,	1
That	1
I	1
do	1
fawne	1
on	1
men,	1
and	1
hugge	1
them	1
hard,	1
And	1
after	1
scandall	1
them:	1
Or	1
if	1
you	1
know,	1
That	1
I	1
professe	1
my	1
selfe	1
in	1
Banquetting	1
To	1
all	1
the	1
Rout,	1
then	1
hold	1
me	1
dangerous.	1
Flourish,	1
and	1
Shout.	1
Bru.	1
What	1
meanes	1
this	1
Showting?	1
I	1
do	1
feare,	1
the	1
People	1
choose	1
Caesar	1
For	1
their	1
King	1
Cassi.	1
I,	1
do	1
you	1
feare	1
it?	1
Then	1
must	1
I	1
thinke	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
haue	1
it	1
so	1
Bru.	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
Cassius,	1
yet	1
I	1
loue	1
him	1
well:	1
But	1
wherefore	1
do	1
you	1
hold	1
me	1
heere	1
so	1
long?	1
What	1
is	1
it,	1
that	1
you	1
would	1
impart	1
to	1
me?	1
If	1
it	1
be	1
ought	1
toward	1
the	1
generall	1
good,	1
Set	1
Honor	1
in	1
one	1
eye,	1
and	1
Death	1
i'th	1
other,	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
looke	1
on	1
both	1
indifferently:	1
For	1
let	1
the	1
Gods	1
so	1
speed	1
mee,	1
as	1
I	1
loue	1
The	1
name	1
of	1
Honor,	1
more	1
then	1
I	1
feare	1
death	1
Cassi.	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
vertue	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
you	1
Brutus,	1
As	1
well	1
as	1
I	1
do	1
know	1
your	1
outward	1
fauour.	1
Well,	1
Honor	1
is	1
the	1
subiect	1
of	1
my	1
Story:	1
I	1
cannot	1
tell,	1
what	1
you	1
and	1
other	1
men	1
Thinke	1
of	1
this	1
life:	1
But	1
for	1
my	1
single	1
selfe,	1
I	1
had	1
as	1
liefe	1
not	1
be,	1
as	1
liue	1
to	1
be	1
In	1
awe	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
Thing,	1
as	1
I	1
my	1
selfe.	1
I	1
was	1
borne	1
free	1
as	1
Caesar,	1
so	1
were	1
you,	1
We	1
both	1
haue	1
fed	1
as	1
well,	1
and	1
we	1
can	1
both	1
Endure	1
the	1
Winters	1
cold,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
hee.	1
For	1
once,	1
vpon	1
a	1
Rawe	1
and	1
Gustie	1
day,	1
The	1
troubled	1
Tyber,	1
chafing	1
with	1
her	1
Shores,	1
Caesar	1
saide	1
to	1
me,	1
Dar'st	1
thou	1
Cassius	1
now	1
Leape	1
in	1
with	1
me	1
into	1
this	1
angry	1
Flood,	1
And	1
swim	1
to	1
yonder	1
Point?	1
Vpon	1
the	1
word,	1
Accoutred	1
as	1
I	1
was,	1
I	1
plunged	1
in,	1
And	1
bad	1
him	1
follow:	1
so	1
indeed	1
he	1
did.	1
The	1
Torrent	1
roar'd,	1
and	1
we	1
did	1
buffet	1
it	1
With	1
lusty	1
Sinewes,	1
throwing	1
it	1
aside,	1
And	1
stemming	1
it	1
with	1
hearts	1
of	1
Controuersie.	1
But	1
ere	1
we	1
could	1
arriue	1
the	1
Point	1
propos'd,	1
Caesar	1
cride,	1
Helpe	1
me	1
Cassius,	1
or	1
I	1
sinke.	1
I	1
(as	1
Aeneas,	1
our	1
great	1
Ancestor,	1
Did	1
from	1
the	1
Flames	1
of	1
Troy,	1
vpon	1
his	1
shoulder	1
The	1
old	1
Anchyses	1
beare)	1
so,	1
from	1
the	1
waues	1
of	1
Tyber	1
Did	1
I	1
the	1
tyred	1
Caesar:	1
And	1
this	1
Man,	1
Is	1
now	1
become	1
a	1
God,	1
and	1
Cassius	1
is	1
A	1
wretched	1
Creature,	1
and	1
must	1
bend	1
his	1
body,	1
If	1
Caesar	1
carelesly	1
but	1
nod	1
on	1
him.	1
He	1
had	1
a	1
Feauer	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
Spaine,	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
Fit	1
was	1
on	1
him,	1
I	1
did	1
marke	1
How	1
he	1
did	1
shake:	1
Tis	1
true,	1
this	1
God	1
did	1
shake,	1
His	1
Coward	1
lippes	1
did	1
from	1
their	1
colour	1
flye,	1
And	1
that	1
same	1
Eye,	1
whose	1
bend	1
doth	1
awe	1
the	1
World,	1
Did	1
loose	1
his	1
Lustre:	1
I	1
did	1
heare	1
him	1
grone:	1
I,	1
and	1
that	1
Tongue	1
of	1
his,	1
that	1
bad	1
the	1
Romans	1
Marke	1
him,	1
and	1
write	1
his	1
Speeches	1
in	1
their	1
Bookes,	1
Alas,	1
it	1
cried,	1
Giue	1
me	1
some	1
drinke	1
Titinius,	1
As	1
a	1
sicke	1
Girle:	1
Ye	1
Gods,	1
it	1
doth	1
amaze	1
me,	1
A	1
man	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
feeble	1
temper	1
should	1
So	1
get	1
the	1
start	1
of	1
the	1
Maiesticke	1
world,	1
And	1
beare	1
the	1
Palme	1
alone.	1
Shout.	1
Flourish.	1
Bru.	1
Another	1
generall	1
shout?	1
I	1
do	1
beleeue,	1
that	1
these	1
applauses	1
are	1
For	1
some	1
new	1
Honors,	1
that	1
are	1
heap'd	1
on	1
Caesar	1
Cassi.	1
Why	1
man,	1
he	1
doth	1
bestride	1
the	1
narrow	1
world	1
Like	1
a	1
Colossus,	1
and	1
we	1
petty	1
men	1
Walke	1
vnder	1
his	1
huge	1
legges,	1
and	1
peepe	1
about	1
To	1
finde	1
our	1
selues	1
dishonourable	1
Graues.	1
Men	1
at	1
sometime,	1
are	1
Masters	1
of	1
their	1
Fates.	1
The	1
fault	1
(deere	1
Brutus)	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
our	1
Starres,	1
But	1
in	1
our	1
Selues,	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
vnderlings.	1
Brutus	1
and	1
Caesar:	1
What	1
should	1
be	1
in	1
that	1
Caesar?	1
Why	1
should	1
that	1
name	1
be	1
sounded	1
more	1
then	1
yours	1
Write	1
them	1
together:	1
Yours,	1
is	1
as	1
faire	1
a	1
Name:	1
Sound	1
them,	1
it	1
doth	1
become	1
the	1
mouth	1
aswell:	1
Weigh	1
them,	1
it	1
is	1
as	1
heauy:	1
Coniure	1
with	1
'em,	1
Brutus	1
will	1
start	1
a	1
Spirit	1
as	1
soone	1
as	1
Caesar.	1
Now	1
in	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
Gods	1
at	1
once,	1
Vpon	1
what	1
meate	1
doth	1
this	1
our	1
Caesar	1
feede,	1
That	1
he	1
is	1
growne	1
so	1
great?	1
Age,	1
thou	1
art	1
sham'd.	1
Rome,	1
thou	1
hast	1
lost	1
the	1
breed	1
of	1
Noble	1
Bloods.	1
When	1
went	1
there	1
by	1
an	1
Age,	1
since	1
the	1
great	1
Flood,	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
fam'd	1
with	1
more	1
then	1
with	1
one	1
man?	1
When	1
could	1
they	1
say	1
(till	1
now)	1
that	1
talk'd	1
of	1
Rome,	1
That	1
her	1
wide	1
Walkes	1
incompast	1
but	1
one	1
man?	1
Now	1
is	1
it	1
Rome	1
indeed,	1
and	1
Roome	1
enough	1
When	1
there	1
is	1
in	1
it	1
but	1
one	1
onely	1
man.	1
O!	1
you	1
and	1
I,	1
haue	1
heard	1
our	1
Fathers	1
say,	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
Brutus	1
once,	1
that	1
would	1
haue	1
brook'd	1
Th'	1
eternall	1
Diuell	1
to	1
keepe	1
his	1
State	1
in	1
Rome,	1
As	1
easily	1
as	1
a	1
King	1
Bru.	1
That	1
you	1
do	1
loue	1
me,	1
I	1
am	1
nothing	1
iealous:	1
What	1
you	1
would	1
worke	1
me	1
too,	1
I	1
haue	1
some	1
ayme:	1
How	1
I	1
haue	1
thought	1
of	1
this,	1
and	1
of	1
these	1
times	1
I	1
shall	1
recount	1
heereafter.	1
For	1
this	1
present,	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
so	1
(with	1
loue	1
I	1
might	1
intreat	1
you)	1
Be	1
any	1
further	1
moou'd:	1
What	1
you	1
haue	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
consider:	1
what	1
you	1
haue	1
to	1
say	1
I	1
will	1
with	1
patience	1
heare,	1
and	1
finde	1
a	1
time	1
Both	1
meete	1
to	1
heare,	1
and	1
answer	1
such	1
high	1
things.	1
Till	1
then,	1
my	1
Noble	1
Friend,	1
chew	1
vpon	1
this:	1
Brutus	1
had	1
rather	1
be	1
a	1
Villager,	1
Then	1
to	1
repute	1
himselfe	1
a	1
Sonne	1
of	1
Rome	1
Vnder	1
these	1
hard	1
Conditions,	1
as	1
this	1
time	1
Is	1
like	1
to	1
lay	1
vpon	1
vs	1
Cassi.	1
I	1
am	1
glad	1
that	1
my	1
weake	1
words	1
Haue	1
strucke	1
but	1
thus	1
much	1
shew	1
of	1
fire	1
from	1
Brutus,	1
Enter	1
Caesar	1
and	1
his	1
Traine.	1
Bru.	1
The	1
Games	1
are	1
done,	1
And	1
Caesar	1
is	1
returning	1
Cassi.	1
As	1
they	1
passe	1
by,	1
Plucke	1
Caska	1
by	1
the	1
Sleeue,	1
And	1
he	1
will	1
(after	1
his	1
sowre	1
fashion)	1
tell	1
you	1
What	1
hath	1
proceeded	1
worthy	1
note	1
to	1
day	1
Bru.	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
so:	1
but	1
looke	1
you	1
Cassius,	1
The	1
angry	1
spot	1
doth	1
glow	1
on	1
Caesars	1
brow,	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
rest,	1
looke	1
like	1
a	1
chidden	1
Traine;	1
Calphurnia's	1
Cheeke	1
is	1
pale,	1
and	1
Cicero	1
Lookes	1
with	1
such	1
Ferret,	1
and	1
such	1
fiery	1
eyes	1
As	1
we	1
haue	1
seene	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
Capitoll	1
Being	1
crost	1
in	1
Conference,	1
by	1
some	1
Senators	1
Cassi.	1
Caska	1
will	1
tell	1
vs	1
what	1
the	1
matter	1
is	1
Caes	1
Antonio	1
Ant.	1
Caesar	1
Caes	1
Let	1
me	1
haue	1
men	1
about	1
me,	1
that	1
are	1
fat,	1
Sleeke-headed	1
men,	1
and	1
such	1
as	1
sleepe	1
a-nights:	1
Yond	1
Cassius	1
has	1
a	1
leane	1
and	1
hungry	1
looke,	1
He	1
thinkes	1
too	1
much:	1
such	1
men	1
are	1
dangerous	1
Ant.	1
Feare	1
him	1
not	1
Caesar,	1
he's	1
not	1
dangerous,	1
He	1
is	1
a	1
Noble	1
Roman,	1
and	1
well	1
giuen	1
Caes	1
Would	1
he	1
were	1
fatter;	1
But	1
I	1
feare	1
him	1
not:	1
Yet	1
if	1
my	1
name	1
were	1
lyable	1
to	1
feare,	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
the	1
man	1
I	1
should	1
auoyd	1
So	1
soone	1
as	1
that	1
spare	1
Cassius.	1
He	1
reades	1
much,	1
He	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
Obseruer,	1
and	1
he	1
lookes	1
Quite	1
through	1
the	1
Deeds	1
of	1
men.	1
He	1
loues	1
no	1
Playes,	1
As	1
thou	1
dost	1
Antony:	1
he	1
heares	1
no	1
Musicke;	1
Seldome	1
he	1
smiles,	1
and	1
smiles	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
sort	1
As	1
if	1
he	1
mock'd	1
himselfe,	1
and	1
scorn'd	1
his	1
spirit	1
That	1
could	1
be	1
mou'd	1
to	1
smile	1
at	1
any	1
thing.	1
Such	1
men	1
as	1
he,	1
be	1
neuer	1
at	1
hearts	1
ease,	1
Whiles	1
they	1
behold	1
a	1
greater	1
then	1
themselues,	1
And	1
therefore	1
are	1
they	1
very	1
dangerous.	1
I	1
rather	1
tell	1
thee	1
what	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
fear'd,	1
Then	1
what	1
I	1
feare:	1
for	1
alwayes	1
I	1
am	1
Caesar.	1
Come	1
on	1
my	1
right	1
hand,	1
for	1
this	1
eare	1
is	1
deafe,	1
And	1
tell	1
me	1
truely,	1
what	1
thou	1
think'st	1
of	1
him.	1
Sennit.	1
Exeunt.	1
Caesar	1
and	1
his	1
Traine.	1
Cask.	1
You	1
pul'd	1
me	1
by	1
the	1
cloake,	1
would	1
you	1
speake	1
with	1
me?	1
Bru.	1
I	1
Caska,	1
tell	1
vs	1
what	1
hath	1
chanc'd	1
to	1
day	1
That	1
Caesar	1
lookes	1
so	1
sad	1
Cask.	1
Why	1
you	1
were	1
with	1
him,	1
were	1
you	1
not?	1
Bru.	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
then	1
aske	1
Caska	1
what	1
had	1
chanc'd	1
Cask.	1
Why	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
Crowne	1
offer'd	1
him;	1
&	1
being	1
offer'd	1
him,	1
he	1
put	1
it	1
by	1
with	1
the	1
backe	1
of	1
his	1
hand	1
thus,	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
people	1
fell	1
a	1
shouting	1
Bru.	1
What	1
was	1
the	1
second	1
noyse	1
for?	1
Cask.	1
Why	1
for	1
that	1
too	1
Cassi.	1
They	1
shouted	1
thrice:	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
last	1
cry	1
for?	1
Cask.	1
Why	1
for	1
that	1
too	1
Bru.	1
Was	1
the	1
Crowne	1
offer'd	1
him	1
thrice?	1
Cask.	1
I	1
marry	1
was't,	1
and	1
hee	1
put	1
it	1
by	1
thrice,	1
euerie	1
time	1
gentler	1
then	1
other;	1
and	1
at	1
euery	1
putting	1
by,	1
mine	1
honest	1
Neighbors	1
showted	1
Cassi.	1
Who	1
offer'd	1
him	1
the	1
Crowne?	1
Cask.	1
Why	1
Antony	1
Bru.	1
Tell	1
vs	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
it,	1
gentle	1
Caska	1
Caska.	1
I	1
can	1
as	1
well	1
bee	1
hang'd	1
as	1
tell	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
it:	1
It	1
was	1
meere	1
Foolerie,	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
marke	1
it.	1
I	1
sawe	1
Marke	1
Antony	1
offer	1
him	1
a	1
Crowne,	1
yet	1
'twas	1
not	1
a	1
Crowne	1
neyther,	1
'twas	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
Coronets:	1
and	1
as	1
I	1
told	1
you,	1
hee	1
put	1
it	1
by	1
once:	1
but	1
for	1
all	1
that,	1
to	1
my	1
thinking,	1
he	1
would	1
faine	1
haue	1
had	1
it.	1
Then	1
hee	1
offered	1
it	1
to	1
him	1
againe:	1
then	1
hee	1
put	1
it	1
by	1
againe:	1
but	1
to	1
my	1
thinking,	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
loath	1
to	1
lay	1
his	1
fingers	1
off	1
it.	1
And	1
then	1
he	1
offered	1
it	1
the	1
third	1
time;	1
hee	1
put	1
it	1
the	1
third	1
time	1
by,	1
and	1
still	1
as	1
hee	1
refus'd	1
it,	1
the	1
rabblement	1
howted,	1
and	1
clapp'd	1
their	1
chopt	1
hands,	1
and	1
threw	1
vppe	1
their	1
sweatie	1
Night-cappes,	1
and	1
vttered	1
such	1
a	1
deale	1
of	1
stinking	1
breath,	1
because	1
Caesar	1
refus'd	1
the	1
Crowne,	1
that	1
it	1
had	1
(almost)	1
choaked	1
Caesar:	1
for	1
hee	1
swoonded,	1
and	1
fell	1
downe	1
at	1
it:	1
And	1
for	1
mine	1
owne	1
part,	1
I	1
durst	1
not	1
laugh,	1
for	1
feare	1
of	1
opening	1
my	1
Lippes,	1
and	1
receyuing	1
the	1
bad	1
Ayre	1
Cassi.	1
But	1
soft	1
I	1
pray	1
you:	1
what,	1
did	1
Caesar	1
swound?	1
Cask.	1
He	1
fell	1
downe	1
in	1
the	1
Market-place,	1
and	1
foam'd	1
at	1
mouth,	1
and	1
was	1
speechlesse	1
Brut.	1
'Tis	1
very	1
like	1
he	1
hath	1
the	1
Falling	1
sicknesse	1
Cassi.	1
No,	1
Caesar	1
hath	1
it	1
not:	1
but	1
you,	1
and	1
I,	1
And	1
honest	1
Caska,	1
we	1
haue	1
the	1
Falling	1
sicknesse	1
Cask.	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
what	1
you	1
meane	1
by	1
that,	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
Caesar	1
fell	1
downe.	1
If	1
the	1
tag-ragge	1
people	1
did	1
not	1
clap	1
him,	1
and	1
hisse	1
him,	1
according	1
as	1
he	1
pleas'd,	1
and	1
displeas'd	1
them,	1
as	1
they	1
vse	1
to	1
doe	1
the	1
Players	1
in	1
the	1
Theatre,	1
I	1
am	1
no	1
true	1
man	1
Brut.	1
What	1
said	1
he,	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
vnto	1
himselfe?	1
Cask.	1
Marry,	1
before	1
he	1
fell	1
downe,	1
when	1
he	1
perceiu'd	1
the	1
common	1
Heard	1
was	1
glad	1
he	1
refus'd	1
the	1
Crowne,	1
he	1
pluckt	1
me	1
ope	1
his	1
Doublet,	1
and	1
offer'd	1
them	1
his	1
Throat	1
to	1
cut:	1
and	1
I	1
had	1
beene	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
any	1
Occupation,	1
if	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
haue	1
taken	1
him	1
at	1
a	1
word,	1
I	1
would	1
I	1
might	1
goe	1
to	1
Hell	1
among	1
the	1
Rogues,	1
and	1
so	1
hee	1
fell.	1
When	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
himselfe	1
againe,	1
hee	1
said,	1
If	1
hee	1
had	1
done,	1
or	1
said	1
any	1
thing	1
amisse,	1
he	1
desir'd	1
their	1
Worships	1
to	1
thinke	1
it	1
was	1
his	1
infirmitie.	1
Three	1
or	1
foure	1
Wenches	1
where	1
I	1
stood,	1
cryed,	1
Alasse	1
good	1
Soule,	1
and	1
forgaue	1
him	1
with	1
all	1
their	1
hearts:	1
But	1
there's	1
no	1
heed	1
to	1
be	1
taken	1
of	1
them;	1
if	1
Caesar	1
had	1
stab'd	1
their	1
Mothers,	1
they	1
would	1
haue	1
done	1
no	1
lesse	1
Brut.	1
And	1
after	1
that,	1
he	1
came	1
thus	1
sad	1
away	1
Cask.	1
I	1
Cassi.	1
Did	1
Cicero	1
say	1
any	1
thing?	1
Cask.	1
I,	1
he	1
spoke	1
Greeke	1
Cassi.	1
To	1
what	1
effect?	1
Cask.	1
Nay,	1
and	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
that,	1
Ile	1
ne're	1
looke	1
you	1
i'th'	1
face	1
againe.	1
But	1
those	1
that	1
vnderstood	1
him,	1
smil'd	1
at	1
one	1
another,	1
and	1
shooke	1
their	1
heads:	1
but	1
for	1
mine	1
owne	1
part,	1
it	1
was	1
Greeke	1
to	1
me.	1
I	1
could	1
tell	1
you	1
more	1
newes	1
too:	1
Murrellus	1
and	1
Flauius,	1
for	1
pulling	1
Scarffes	1
off	1
Caesars	1
Images,	1
are	1
put	1
to	1
silence.	1
Fare	1
you	1
well.	1
There	1
was	1
more	1
Foolerie	1
yet,	1
if	1
I	1
could	1
remember	1
it	1
Cassi.	1
Will	1
you	1
suppe	1
with	1
me	1
to	1
Night,	1
Caska?	1
Cask.	1
No,	1
I	1
am	1
promis'd	1
forth	1
Cassi.	1
Will	1
you	1
Dine	1
with	1
me	1
to	1
morrow?	1
Cask.	1
I,	1
if	1
I	1
be	1
aliue,	1
and	1
your	1
minde	1
hold,	1
and	1
your	1
Dinner	1
worth	1
the	1
eating	1
Cassi.	1
Good,	1
I	1
will	1
expect	1
you	1
Cask.	1
Doe	1
so:	1
farewell	1
both.	1
Enter.	1
Brut.	1
What	1
a	1
blunt	1
fellow	1
is	1
this	1
growne	1
to	1
be?	1
He	1
was	1
quick	1
Mettle,	1
when	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
Schoole	1
Cassi.	1
So	1
is	1
he	1
now,	1
in	1
execution	1
Of	1
any	1
bold,	1
or	1
Noble	1
Enterprize,	1
How-euer	1
he	1
puts	1
on	1
this	1
tardie	1
forme:	1
This	1
Rudenesse	1
is	1
a	1
Sawce	1
to	1
his	1
good	1
Wit,	1
Which	1
giues	1
men	1
stomacke	1
to	1
disgest	1
his	1
words	1
With	1
better	1
Appetite	1
Brut.	1
And	1
so	1
it	1
is:	1
For	1
this	1
time	1
I	1
will	1
leaue	1
you:	1
To	1
morrow,	1
if	1
you	1
please	1
to	1
speake	1
with	1
me,	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
home	1
to	1
you:	1
or	1
if	1
you	1
will,	1
Come	1
home	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
wait	1
for	1
you	1
Cassi.	1
I	1
will	1
doe	1
so:	1
till	1
then,	1
thinke	1
of	1
the	1
World.	1
Exit	1
Brutus.	1
Well	1
Brutus,	1
thou	1
art	1
Noble:	1
yet	1
I	1
see,	1
Thy	1
Honorable	1
Mettle	1
may	1
be	1
wrought	1
From	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
dispos'd:	1
therefore	1
it	1
is	1
meet,	1
That	1
Noble	1
mindes	1
keepe	1
euer	1
with	1
their	1
likes:	1
For	1
who	1
so	1
firme,	1
that	1
cannot	1
be	1
seduc'd?	1
Caesar	1
doth	1
beare	1
me	1
hard,	1
but	1
he	1
loues	1
Brutus.	1
If	1
I	1
were	1
Brutus	1
now,	1
and	1
he	1
were	1
Cassius,	1
He	1
should	1
not	1
humor	1
me.	1
I	1
will	1
this	1
Night,	1
In	1
seuerall	1
Hands,	1
in	1
at	1
his	1
Windowes	1
throw,	1
As	1
if	1
they	1
came	1
from	1
seuerall	1
Citizens,	1
Writings,	1
all	1
tending	1
to	1
the	1
great	1
opinion	1
That	1
Rome	1
holds	1
of	1
his	1
Name:	1
wherein	1
obscurely	1
Caesars	1
Ambition	1
shall	1
be	1
glanced	1
at.	1
And	1
after	1
this,	1
let	1
Caesar	1
seat	1
him	1
sure,	1
For	1
wee	1
will	1
shake	1
him,	1
or	1
worse	1
dayes	1
endure.	1
Enter.	1
Thunder,	1
and	1
Lightning.	1
Enter	1
Caska,	1
and	1
Cicero.	1
Cic.	1
Good	1
euen,	1
Caska:	1
brought	1
you	1
Caesar	1
home?	1
Why	1
are	1
you	1
breathlesse,	1
and	1
why	1
stare	1
you	1
so?	1
Cask.	1
Are	1
not	1
you	1
mou'd,	1
when	1
all	1
the	1
sway	1
of	1
Earth	1
Shakes,	1
like	1
a	1
thing	1
vnfirme?	1
O	1
Cicero,	1
I	1
haue	1
seene	1
Tempests,	1
when	1
the	1
scolding	1
Winds	1
Haue	1
riu'd	1
the	1
knottie	1
Oakes,	1
and	1
I	1
haue	1
seene	1
Th'	1
ambitious	1
Ocean	1
swell,	1
and	1
rage,	1
and	1
foame,	1
To	1
be	1
exalted	1
with	1
the	1
threatning	1
Clouds:	1
But	1
neuer	1
till	1
to	1
Night,	1
neuer	1
till	1
now,	1
Did	1
I	1
goe	1
through	1
a	1
Tempest-dropping-fire.	1
Eyther	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
Ciuill	1
strife	1
in	1
Heauen,	1
Or	1
else	1
the	1
World,	1
too	1
sawcie	1
with	1
the	1
Gods,	1
Incenses	1
them	1
to	1
send	1
destruction	1
Cic.	1
Why,	1
saw	1
you	1
any	1
thing	1
more	1
wonderfull?	1
Cask.	1
A	1
common	1
slaue,	1
you	1
know	1
him	1
well	1
by	1
sight,	1
Held	1
vp	1
his	1
left	1
Hand,	1
which	1
did	1
flame	1
and	1
burne	1
Like	1
twentie	1
Torches	1
ioyn'd;	1
and	1
yet	1
his	1
Hand,	1
Not	1
sensible	1
of	1
fire,	1
remain'd	1
vnscorch'd.	1
Besides,	1
I	1
ha'	1
not	1
since	1
put	1
vp	1
my	1
Sword,	1
Against	1
the	1
Capitoll	1
I	1
met	1
a	1
Lyon,	1
Who	1
glaz'd	1
vpon	1
me,	1
and	1
went	1
surly	1
by,	1
Without	1
annoying	1
me.	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
drawne	1
Vpon	1
a	1
heape,	1
a	1
hundred	1
gastly	1
Women,	1
Transformed	1
with	1
their	1
feare,	1
who	1
swore,	1
they	1
saw	1
Men,	1
all	1
in	1
fire,	1
walke	1
vp	1
and	1
downe	1
the	1
streetes.	1
And	1
yesterday,	1
the	1
Bird	1
of	1
Night	1
did	1
sit,	1
Euen	1
at	1
Noone-day,	1
vpon	1
the	1
Market	1
place,	1
Howting,	1
and	1
shreeking.	1
When	1
these	1
Prodigies	1
Doe	1
so	1
conioyntly	1
meet,	1
let	1
not	1
men	1
say,	1
These	1
are	1
their	1
Reasons,	1
they	1
are	1
Naturall:	1
For	1
I	1
beleeue,	1
they	1
are	1
portentous	1
things	1
Vnto	1
the	1
Clymate,	1
that	1
they	1
point	1
vpon	1
Cic.	1
Indeed,	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
strange	1
disposed	1
time:	1
But	1
men	1
may	1
construe	1
things	1
after	1
their	1
fashion,	1
Cleane	1
from	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
themselues.	1
Comes	1
Caesar	1
to	1
the	1
Capitoll	1
to	1
morrow?	1
Cask.	1
He	1
doth:	1
for	1
he	1
did	1
bid	1
Antonio	1
Send	1
word	1
to	1
you,	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
there	1
to	1
morrow	1
Cic.	1
Good-night	1
then,	1
Caska:	1
This	1
disturbed	1
Skie	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
walke	1
in	1
Cask.	1
Farewell	1
Cicero.	1
Exit	1
Cicero.	1
Enter	1
Cassius.	1
Cassi.	1
Who's	1
there?	1
Cask.	1
A	1
Romane	1
Cassi.	1
Caska,	1
by	1
your	1
Voyce	1
Cask.	1
Your	1
Eare	1
is	1
good.	1
Cassius,	1
what	1
Night	1
is	1
this?	1
Cassi.	1
A	1
very	1
pleasing	1
Night	1
to	1
honest	1
men	1
Cask.	1
Who	1
euer	1
knew	1
the	1
Heauens	1
menace	1
so?	1
Cassi.	1
Those	1
that	1
haue	1
knowne	1
the	1
Earth	1
so	1
full	1
of	1
faults.	1
For	1
my	1
part,	1
I	1
haue	1
walk'd	1
about	1
the	1
streets,	1
Submitting	1
me	1
vnto	1
the	1
perillous	1
Night;	1
And	1
thus	1
vnbraced,	1
Caska,	1
as	1
you	1
see,	1
Haue	1
bar'd	1
my	1
Bosome	1
to	1
the	1
Thunder-stone:	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
crosse	1
blew	1
Lightning	1
seem'd	1
to	1
open	1
The	1
Brest	1
of	1
Heauen,	1
I	1
did	1
present	1
my	1
selfe	1
Euen	1
in	1
the	1
ayme,	1
and	1
very	1
flash	1
of	1
it	1
Cask.	1
But	1
wherefore	1
did	1
you	1
so	1
much	1
tempt	1
the	1
Heauens?	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
men,	1
to	1
feare	1
and	1
tremble,	1
When	1
the	1
most	1
mightie	1
Gods,	1
by	1
tokens	1
send	1
Such	1
dreadfull	1
Heraulds,	1
to	1
astonish	1
vs	1
Cassi.	1
You	1
are	1
dull,	1
Caska:	1
And	1
those	1
sparkes	1
of	1
Life,	1
that	1
should	1
be	1
in	1
a	1
Roman,	1
You	1
doe	1
want,	1
or	1
else	1
you	1
vse	1
not.	1
You	1
looke	1
pale,	1
and	1
gaze,	1
and	1
put	1
on	1
feare,	1
And	1
cast	1
your	1
selfe	1
in	1
wonder,	1
To	1
see	1
the	1
strange	1
impatience	1
of	1
the	1
Heauens:	1
But	1
if	1
you	1
would	1
consider	1
the	1
true	1
cause,	1
Why	1
all	1
these	1
Fires,	1
why	1
all	1
these	1
gliding	1
Ghosts,	1
Why	1
Birds	1
and	1
Beasts,	1
from	1
qualitie	1
and	1
kinde,	1
Why	1
Old	1
men,	1
Fooles,	1
and	1
Children	1
calculate,	1
Why	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
change	1
from	1
their	1
Ordinance,	1
Their	1
Natures,	1
and	1
pre-formed	1
Faculties,	1
To	1
monstrous	1
qualitie;	1
why	1
you	1
shall	1
finde,	1
That	1
Heauen	1
hath	1
infus'd	1
them	1
with	1
these	1
Spirits,	1
To	1
make	1
them	1
Instruments	1
of	1
feare,	1
and	1
warning,	1
Vnto	1
some	1
monstrous	1
State.	1
Now	1
could	1
I	1
(Caska)	1
name	1
to	1
thee	1
a	1
man,	1
Most	1
like	1
this	1
dreadfull	1
Night,	1
That	1
Thunders,	1
Lightens,	1
opens	1
Graues,	1
and	1
roares,	1
As	1
doth	1
the	1
Lyon	1
in	1
the	1
Capitoll:	1
A	1
man	1
no	1
mightier	1
then	1
thy	1
selfe,	1
or	1
me,	1
In	1
personall	1
action;	1
yet	1
prodigious	1
growne,	1
And	1
fearefull,	1
as	1
these	1
strange	1
eruptions	1
are	1
Cask.	1
'Tis	1
Caesar	1
that	1
you	1
meane:	1
Is	1
it	1
not,	1
Cassius?	1
Cassi.	1
Let	1
it	1
be	1
who	1
it	1
is:	1
for	1
Romans	1
now	1
Haue	1
Thewes,	1
and	1
Limbes,	1
like	1
to	1
their	1
Ancestors;	1
But	1
woe	1
the	1
while,	1
our	1
Fathers	1
mindes	1
are	1
dead,	1
And	1
we	1
are	1
gouern'd	1
with	1
our	1
Mothers	1
spirits,	1
Our	1
yoake,	1
and	1
sufferance,	1
shew	1
vs	1
Womanish	1
Cask.	1
Indeed,	1
they	1
say,	1
the	1
Senators	1
to	1
morrow	1
Meane	1
to	1
establish	1
Caesar	1
as	1
a	1
King:	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
weare	1
his	1
Crowne	1
by	1
Sea,	1
and	1
Land,	1
In	1
euery	1
place,	1
saue	1
here	1
in	1
Italy	1
Cassi.	1
I	1
know	1
where	1
I	1
will	1
weare	1
this	1
Dagger	1
then;	1
Cassius	1
from	1
Bondage	1
will	1
deliuer	1
Cassius:	1
Therein,	1
yee	1
Gods,	1
you	1
make	1
the	1
weake	1
most	1
strong;	1
Therein,	1
yee	1
Gods,	1
you	1
Tyrants	1
doe	1
defeat.	1
Nor	1
Stonie	1
Tower,	1
nor	1
Walls	1
of	1
beaten	1
Brasse,	1
Nor	1
ayre-lesse	1
Dungeon,	1
nor	1
strong	1
Linkes	1
of	1
Iron,	1
Can	1
be	1
retentiue	1
to	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
spirit:	1
But	1
Life	1
being	1
wearie	1
of	1
these	1
worldly	1
Barres,	1
Neuer	1
lacks	1
power	1
to	1
dismisse	1
it	1
selfe.	1
If	1
I	1
know	1
this,	1
know	1
all	1
the	1
World	1
besides,	1
That	1
part	1
of	1
Tyrannie	1
that	1
I	1
doe	1
beare,	1
I	1
can	1
shake	1
off	1
at	1
pleasure.	1
Thunder	1
still.	1
Cask.	1
So	1
can	1
I:	1
So	1
euery	1
Bond-man	1
in	1
his	1
owne	1
hand	1
beares	1
The	1
power	1
to	1
cancell	1
his	1
Captiuitie	1
Cassi.	1
And	1
why	1
should	1
C�sar	1
be	1
a	1
Tyrant	1
then?	1
Poore	1
man,	1
I	1
know	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
a	1
Wolfe,	1
But	1
that	1
he	1
sees	1
the	1
Romans	1
are	1
but	1
Sheepe:	1
He	1
were	1
no	1
Lyon,	1
were	1
not	1
Romans	1
Hindes.	1
Those	1
that	1
with	1
haste	1
will	1
make	1
a	1
mightie	1
fire,	1
Begin	1
it	1
with	1
weake	1
Strawes.	1
What	1
trash	1
is	1
Rome?	1
What	1
Rubbish,	1
and	1
what	1
Offall?	1
when	1
it	1
serues	1
For	1
the	1
base	1
matter,	1
to	1
illuminate	1
So	1
vile	1
a	1
thing	1
as	1
Caesar.	1
But	1
oh	1
Griefe,	1
Where	1
hast	1
thou	1
led	1
me?	1
I	1
(perhaps)	1
speake	1
this	1
Before	1
a	1
willing	1
Bond-man:	1
then	1
I	1
know	1
My	1
answere	1
must	1
be	1
made.	1
But	1
I	1
am	1
arm'd,	1
And	1
dangers	1
are	1
to	1
me	1
indifferent	1
Cask.	1
You	1
speake	1
to	1
Caska,	1
and	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
man,	1
That	1
is	1
no	1
flearing	1
Tell-tale.	1
Hold,	1
my	1
Hand:	1
Be	1
factious	1
for	1
redresse	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
Griefes,	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
set	1
this	1
foot	1
of	1
mine	1
as	1
farre,	1
As	1
who	1
goes	1
farthest	1
Cassi.	1
There's	1
a	1
Bargaine	1
made.	1
Now	1
know	1
you,	1
Caska,	1
I	1
haue	1
mou'd	1
already	1
Some	1
certaine	1
of	1
the	1
Noblest	1
minded	1
Romans	1
To	1
vnder-goe,	1
with	1
me,	1
an	1
Enterprize,	1
Of	1
Honorable	1
dangerous	1
consequence;	1
And	1
I	1
doe	1
know	1
by	1
this,	1
they	1
stay	1
for	1
me	1
In	1
Pompeyes	1
Porch:	1
for	1
now	1
this	1
fearefull	1
Night,	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
stirre,	1
or	1
walking	1
in	1
the	1
streetes;	1
And	1
the	1
Complexion	1
of	1
the	1
Element	1
Is	1
Fauors,	1
like	1
the	1
Worke	1
we	1
haue	1
in	1
hand,	1
Most	1
bloodie,	1
fierie,	1
and	1
most	1
terrible.	1
Enter	1
Cinna.	1
Caska.	1
Stand	1
close	1
a	1
while,	1
for	1
heere	1
comes	1
one	1
in	1
haste	1
Cassi.	1
'Tis	1
Cinna,	1
I	1
doe	1
know	1
him	1
by	1
his	1
Gate,	1
He	1
is	1
a	1
friend.	1
Cinna,	1
where	1
haste	1
you	1
so?	1
Cinna.	1
To	1
finde	1
out	1
you:	1
Who's	1
that,	1
Metellus	1
Cymber?	1
Cassi.	1
No,	1
it	1
is	1
Caska,	1
one	1
incorporate	1
To	1
our	1
Attempts.	1
Am	1
I	1
not	1
stay'd	1
for,	1
Cinna?	1
Cinna.	1
I	1
am	1
glad	1
on't.	1
What	1
a	1
fearefull	1
Night	1
is	1
this?	1
There's	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
of	1
vs	1
haue	1
seene	1
strange	1
sights	1
Cassi.	1
Am	1
I	1
not	1
stay'd	1
for?	1
tell	1
me	1
Cinna.	1
Yes,	1

See	1

entire	1
Vpon	1
the	1
next	1

O,	1
he	1
sits	1
high	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
Peoples	1
hearts:	1
And	1
that	1
which	1
would	1
appeare	1
Offence	1
in	1
vs,	1
His	1
Countenance,	1
like	1
richest	1
Alchymie,	1
Will	1
change	1
to	1
Vertue,	1
and	1
to	1
Worthinesse	1
Cassi.	1
Him,	1
and	1
his	1
worth,	1
and	1
our	1
great	1
need	1
of	1
him,	1
You	1
haue	1
right	1
well	1
conceited:	1
let	1
vs	1
goe,	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
after	1
Mid-night,	1
and	1
ere	1
day,	1
We	1
will	1
awake	1
him,	1
and	1
be	1
sure	1
of	1
him.	1
Exeunt.	1
Actus	1
Secundus.	1
Enter	1
Brutus	1
in	1
his	1
Orchard.	1
Brut.	1
What	1
Lucius,	1
hoe?	1
I	1
cannot,	1
by	1
the	1
progresse	1
of	1
the	1
Starres,	1
Giue	1
guesse	1
how	1
neere	1
to	1
day-	1
Lucius,	1
I	1
say?	1
I	1
would	1
it	1
were	1
my	1
fault	1
to	1
sleepe	1
so	1
soundly.	1
When	1
Lucius,	1
when?	1
awake,	1
I	1
say:	1
what	1
Lucius?	1
Enter	1
Lucius.	1
Luc.	1
Call'd	1
you,	1
my	1
Lord?	1
Brut.	1
Get	1
me	1
a	1
Tapor	1
in	1
my	1
Study,	1
Lucius:	1
When	1
it	1
is	1
lighted,	1
come	1
and	1
call	1
me	1
here	1
Luc.	1
I	1
will,	1
my	1
Lord.	1
Enter.	1
Brut.	1
It	1
must	1
be	1
by	1
his	1
death:	1
and	1
for	1
my	1
part,	1
I	1
know	1
no	1
personall	1
cause,	1
to	1
spurne	1
at	1
him,	1
But	1
for	1
the	1
generall.	1
He	1
would	1
be	1
crown'd:	1
How	1
that	1
might	1
change	1
his	1
nature,	1
there's	1
the	1
question?	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
bright	1
day,	1
that	1
brings	1
forth	1
the	1
Adder,	1
And	1
that	1
craues	1
warie	1
walking:	1
Crowne	1
him	1
that,	1
And	1
then	1
I	1
graunt	1
we	1
put	1
a	1
Sting	1
in	1
him,	1
That	1
at	1
his	1
will	1
he	1
may	1
doe	1
danger	1
with.	1
Th'	1
abuse	1
of	1
Greatnesse,	1
is,	1
when	1
it	1
dis-ioynes	1
Remorse	1
from	1
Power:	1
And	1
to	1
speake	1
truth	1
of	1
Caesar,	1
I	1
haue	1
not	1
knowne,	1
when	1
his	1
Affections	1
sway'd	1
More	1
then	1
his	1
Reason.	1
But	1
'tis	1
a	1
common	1
proofe,	1
That	1
Lowlynesse	1
is	1
young	1
Ambitions	1
Ladder,	1
Whereto	1
the	1
Climber	1
vpward	1
turnes	1
his	1
Face:	1
But	1
when	1
he	1
once	1
attaines	1
the	1
vpmost	1
Round,	1
He	1
then	1
vnto	1
the	1
Ladder	1
turnes	1
his	1
Backe,	1
Lookes	1
in	1
the	1
Clouds,	1
scorning	1
the	1
base	1
degrees	1
By	1
which	1
he	1
did	1
ascend:	1
so	1
Caesar	1
may;	1
Then	1
least	1
he	1
may,	1
preuent.	1
And	1
since	1
the	1
Quarrell	1
Will	1
beare	1
no	1
colour,	1
for	1
the	1
thing	1
he	1
is,	1
Fashion	1
it	1
thus;	1
that	1
what	1
he	1
is,	1
augmented,	1
Would	1
runne	1
to	1
these,	1
and	1
these	1
extremities:	1
And	1
therefore	1
thinke	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
Serpents	1
egge,	1
Which	1
hatch'd,	1
would	1
as	1
his	1
kinde	1
grow	1
mischieuous;	1
And	1
kill	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
shell.	1
Enter	1
Lucius.	1
Luc.	1
The	1
Taper	1
burneth	1
in	1
your	1
Closet,	1
Sir:	1
Searching	1
the	1
Window	1
for	1
a	1
Flint,	1
I	1
found	1
This	1
Paper,	1
thus	1
seal'd	1
vp,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
It	1
did	1
not	1
lye	1
there	1
when	1
I	1
went	1
to	1
Bed.	1
Giues	1
him	1
the	1
Letter.	1
Brut.	1
Get	1
you	1
to	1
Bed	1
againe,	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
day:	1
Is	1
not	1
to	1
morrow	1
(Boy)	1
the	1
first	1
of	1
March?	1
Luc.	1
I	1
know	1
not,	1
Sir	1
Brut.	1
Looke	1
in	1
the	1
Calender,	1
and	1
bring	1

word	1
Luc.	1
I	1
will,	1
Sir.	1
Enter.	1
Brut.	1
The	1
exhalations,	1
whizzing	1
in	1
the	1
ayre,	1
Giue	1
so	1
much	1
light,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
reade	1
by	1
them.	1
Opens	1
the	1
Letter,	1
and	1
reades.	1
Brutus	1
thou	1
sleep'st;	1
awake,	1
and	1
see	1
thy	1
selfe:	1
Shall	1
Rome,	1
&c.	1
speake,	1
strike,	1
redresse.	1
Brutus,	1
thou	1
sleep'st:	1
awake.	1
Such	1
instigations	1
haue	1
beene	1
often	1
dropt,	1
Where	1
I	1
haue	1
tooke	1
them	1
vp:	1
Shall	1
Rome,	1
&c.	1
Thus	1
must	1
I	1
piece	1
it	1
out:	1
Shall	1
Rome	1
stand	1
vnder	1
one	1
mans	1
awe?	1
What	1
Rome?	1
My	1
Ancestors	1
did	1
from	1
the	1
streetes	1
of	1
Rome	1
The	1
Tarquin	1
driue,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
call'd	1
a	1
King.	1
Speake,	1
strike,	1
redresse.	1
Am	1
I	1
entreated	1
To	1
speake,	1
and	1
strike?	1
O	1
Rome,	1
I	1
make	1
thee	1
promise,	1
If	1
the	1
redresse	1
will	1
follow,	1
thou	1
receiuest	1
Thy	1
full	1
Petition	1
at	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Brutus.	1
Enter	1
Lucius.	1
Luc.	1
Sir,	1
March	1
is	1
wasted	1
fifteene	1
dayes.	1
Knocke	1
within.	1
Brut.	1
'Tis	1
good.	1
Go	1
to	1
the	1
Gate,	1
some	1
body	1
knocks:	1
Since	1
Cassius	1
first	1
did	1
whet	1
me	1
against	1
Caesar,	1
I	1
haue	1
not	1
slept.	1
Betweene	1
the	1
acting	1
of	1
a	1
dreadfull	1
thing,	1
And	1
the	1
first	1
motion,	1
all	1
the	1
Interim	1
is	1
Like	1
a	1
Phantasma,	1
or	1
a	1
hideous	1
Dreame:	1
The	1
Genius,	1
and	1
the	1
mortall	1
Instruments	1
Are	1
then	1
in	1
councell;	1
and	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
a	1
man,	1
Like	1
to	1
a	1
little	1
Kingdome,	1
suffers	1
then	1
The	1
nature	1
of	1
an	1
Insurrection.	1
Enter	1
Lucius.	1
Luc.	1
Sir,	1

your	1
Brother	1
Cassius	1

Doore,	1
Who	1

Is	1

No,	1

Doe	1

No,	1
Sir,	1

Hats	1

pluckt	1
about	1
their	1
Eares,	1
And	1
halfe	1
their	1
Faces	1
buried	1

Cloakes,	1
That	1
by	1
no	1

I	1
may	1

By	1
any	1
marke	1
of	1
fauour	1
Brut.	1
Let	1

They	1

O	1

Sham'st	1

Night,	1
When	1

O	1

Where	1
wilt	1

a	1
Cauerne	1
darke	1

To	1

monstrous	1
Visage?	1
Seek	1
none	1
Conspiracie,	1
Hide	1
it	1
in	1
Smiles,	1
and	1
Affabilitie:	1
For	1
if	1
thou	1
path	1
thy	1
natiue	1
semblance	1

Not	1
Erebus	1
it	1
selfe	1
were	1

To	1

from	1
preuention.	1
Enter	1

Conspirators,	1
Cassius,	1
Caska,	1
Decius,	1
Cinna,	1
Metellus,	1
and	1
Trebonius.	1
Cass.	1
I	1
thinke	1
we	1

bold	1
vpon	1
your	1
Rest:	1
Good	1

Brutus,	1
doe	1
we	1

Know	1

Yes,	1
euery	1

and	1
no	1

But	1
honors	1
you:	1
and	1
euery	1

You	1

that	1
opinion	1
of	1
your	1

Which	1
euery	1
Noble	1
Roman	1
beares	1
of	1
you.	1
This	1

He	1

They	1

What	1
watchfull	1
Cares	1
doe	1
interpose	1
themselues	1
Betwixt	1

Eyes,	1

Night?	1
Cass.	1
Shall	1

They	1

Here	1

Cask.	1
No	1

O	1

doth;	1
and	1
yon	1
grey	1
Lines,	1
That	1
fret	1
the	1
Clouds,	1
are	1
Messengers	1
of	1
Day	1
Cask.	1
You	1
shall	1
confesse,	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
both	1
deceiu'd:	1
Heere,	1
as	1
I	1
point	1
my	1
Sword,	1
the	1
Sunne	1
arises,	1
Which	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
way	1
growing	1
on	1
the	1
South,	1
Weighing	1
the	1
youthfull	1
Season	1
of	1
the	1
yeare.	1
Some	1
two	1
moneths	1
hence,	1
vp	1
higher	1
toward	1
the	1
North	1
He	1
first	1
presents	1
his	1

and	1

Stands	1
as	1

Bru.	1
Giue	1
me	1
your	1

all	1
ouer,	1
one	1

one	1
Cas.	1
And	1
let	1

sweare	1
our	1
Resolution	1
Brut.	1
No,	1
not	1
an	1
Oath:	1
if	1
not	1

Face	1
of	1

The	1
sufferance	1
of	1
our	1
Soules,	1
the	1

Abuse;	1
If	1
these	1
be	1
Motiues	1
weake,	1
breake	1
off	1
betimes,	1
And	1
euery	1

So	1
let	1
high-sighted-Tyranny	1
range	1
on,	1
Till	1
each	1

drop	1
by	1
Lottery.	1
But	1
if	1
these	1
(As	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
they	1
do)	1
beare	1

To	1

The	1

To	1

Romans,	1
that	1
haue	1
spoke	1

And	1

And	1
what	1
other	1
Oath,	1
Then	1
Honesty	1
to	1
Honesty	1
ingag'd,	1
That	1
this	1
shall	1
be,	1
or	1

will	1
fall	1
for	1

Sweare	1
Priests	1

Cautelous	1
Old	1
feeble	1
Carrions,	1
and	1

That	1

Vnto	1

sweare	1
Such	1

That	1
euery	1

If	1

Of	1

Cas.	1
But	1
what	1
of	1
Cicero?	1
Shall	1
we	1
sound	1
him?	1
I	1
thinke	1
he	1
will	1
stand	1
very	1
strong	1
with	1
vs	1
Cask.	1
Let	1
vs	1
not	1
leaue	1

out	1
Cyn.	1
No,	1
by	1
no	1

Metel.	1
O	1
let	1

haue	1
him,	1
for	1
his	1
Siluer	1
haires	1
Will	1
purchase	1
vs	1
a	1
good	1
opinion:	1
And	1
buy	1
mens	1
voyces,	1
to	1
commend	1
our	1

It	1
shall	1
be	1
sayd,	1
his	1
iudgement	1
rul'd	1
our	1

Our	1
youths,	1

wildenesse,	1
shall	1
no	1

But	1
all	1
be	1
buried	1
in	1
his	1
Grauity	1
Bru.	1
O	1
name	1
him	1
not;	1
let	1
vs	1
not	1
breake	1

him,	1
For	1
he	1
will	1
neuer	1
follow	1
any	1
thing	1
That	1
other	1
men	1
begin	1
Cas.	1
Then	1
leaue	1
him	1
out	1
Cask.	1
Indeed,	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
fit	1
Decius.	1
Shall	1
no	1
man	1
else	1
be	1
toucht,	1
but	1
onely	1
Caesar?	1
Cas.	1
Decius	1
well	1
vrg'd:	1
I	1
thinke	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
meet,	1
Marke	1
Antony,	1
so	1
well	1
belou'd	1
of	1
Caesar,	1
Should	1

A	1
shrew'd	1
Contriuer.	1
And	1
you	1
know,	1
his	1
meanes	1
If	1
he	1
improue	1
them,	1
may	1
well	1
stretch	1
so	1
farre	1
As	1
to	1
annoy	1
vs	1
all:	1
which	1
to	1
preuent,	1
Let	1
Antony	1
and	1
Caesar	1
fall	1
together	1
Bru.	1
Our	1
course	1
will	1
seeme	1
too	1
bloody,	1
Caius	1
Cassius,	1
To	1
cut	1
the	1
Head	1
off,	1
and	1
then	1
hacke	1
the	1
Limbes:	1
Like	1
Wrath	1
in	1
death,	1
and	1
Enuy	1
afterwards:	1
For	1
Antony,	1
is	1
but	1
a	1
Limbe	1
of	1
Caesar.	1
Let's	1
be	1
Sacrificers,	1
but	1
not	1
Butchers	1
Caius:	1
We	1
all	1
stand	1
vp	1
against	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
Caesar,	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
men,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
blood:	1
O	1
that	1
we	1
then	1
could	1
come	1
by	1
Caesars	1
Spirit,	1
And	1
not	1
dismember	1
Caesar!	1
But	1
(alas)	1
Caesar	1
must	1
bleed	1
for	1
it.	1
And	1
gentle	1
Friends,	1
Let's	1
kill	1
him	1
Boldly,	1
but	1
not	1
Wrathfully:	1
Let's	1
carue	1
him,	1
as	1
a	1
Dish	1
fit	1
for	1
the	1
Gods,	1
Not	1
hew	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
Carkasse	1
fit	1
for	1
Hounds:	1
And	1
let	1
our	1
Hearts,	1
as	1
subtle	1
Masters	1
do,	1
Stirre	1
vp	1
their	1
Seruants	1
to	1
an	1
acte	1
of	1
Rage,	1
And	1
after	1
seeme	1
to	1
chide	1
'em.	1
This	1
shall	1
make	1
Our	1
purpose	1
Necessary,	1
and	1
not	1
Enuious.	1
Which	1
so	1
appearing	1
to	1
the	1
common	1
eyes,	1
We	1
shall	1
be	1
call'd	1
Purgers,	1
not	1
Murderers.	1
And	1
for	1
Marke	1
Antony,	1
thinke	1
not	1
of	1
him:	1
For	1
he	1
can	1
do	1
no	1
more	1
then	1
Caesars	1
Arme,	1
When	1
Caesars	1
head	1
is	1
off	1
Cas.	1
Yet	1
I	1
feare	1
him,	1
For	1
in	1
the	1
ingrafted	1
loue	1
he	1
beares	1
to	1
Caesar	1
Bru.	1
Alas,	1
good	1
Cassius,	1
do	1
not	1
thinke	1
of	1
him:	1
If	1
he	1
loue	1
Caesar,	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
can	1
do	1
Is	1
to	1
himselfe;	1
take	1
thought,	1
and	1
dye	1
for	1
Caesar,	1
And	1
that	1
were	1
much	1
he	1
should:	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
giuen	1
To	1
sports,	1
to	1
wildenesse,	1
and	1
much	1
company	1
Treb.	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
feare	1
in	1
him;	1
let	1
him	1
not	1
dye,	1
For	1
he	1
will	1
liue,	1
and	1
laugh	1
at	1
this	1
heereafter.	1
Clocke	1
strikes.	1
Bru.	1
Peace,	1
count	1
the	1
Clocke	1
Cas.	1
The	1
Clocke	1
hath	1
stricken	1
three	1
Treb.	1
'Tis	1
time	1
to	1
part	1
Cass.	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
doubtfull	1
yet,	1
Whether	1
Caesar	1
will	1
come	1
forth	1
to	1
day,	1
or	1
no:	1
For	1
he	1
is	1
Superstitious	1
growne	1
of	1
late,	1
Quite	1
from	1
the	1
maine	1
Opinion	1
he	1
held	1
once,	1
Of	1
Fantasie,	1
of	1
Dreames,	1
and	1
Ceremonies:	1
It	1
may	1
be,	1
these	1
apparant	1
Prodigies,	1
The	1
vnaccustom'd	1
Terror	1
of	1
this	1
night,	1
And	1
the	1
perswasion	1
of	1
his	1
Augurers,	1
May	1
hold	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
Capitoll	1
to	1
day	1
Decius.	1
Neuer	1
feare	1
that:	1
If	1
he	1
be	1
so	1
resolu'd,	1
I	1
can	1
ore-sway	1
him:	1
For	1
he	1
loues	1
to	1
heare,	1
That	1
Vnicornes	1
may	1
be	1
betray'd	1
with	1
Trees,	1
And	1
Beares	1
with	1
Glasses,	1
Elephants	1
with	1
Holes,	1
Lyons	1
with	1
Toyles,	1
and	1
men	1
with	1
Flatterers.	1
But,	1
when	1
I	1
tell	1
him,	1
he	1
hates	1
Flatterers,	1
He	1
sayes,	1
he	1
does;	1
being	1
then	1
most	1
flattered.	1
Let	1
me	1
worke:	1
For	1
I	1
can	1
giue	1
his	1
humour	1
the	1
true	1
bent;	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
Capitoll	1
Cas.	1
Nay,	1
we	1
will	1
all	1
of	1
vs,	1
be	1
there	1
to	1
fetch	1
him	1
Bru.	1
By	1
the	1
eight	1
houre,	1
is	1
that	1
the	1
vttermost?	1
Cin.	1
Be	1
that	1
the	1
vttermost,	1
and	1
faile	1
not	1
then	1
Met.	1
Caius	1
Ligarius	1
doth	1
beare	1
Caesar	1
hard,	1
Who	1
rated	1
him	1
for	1
speaking	1
well	1
of	1
Pompey;	1
I	1
wonder	1
none	1
of	1
you	1
haue	1
thought	1
of	1
him	1
Bru.	1
Now	1
good	1
Metellus	1
go	1
along	1
by	1
him:	1
He	1
loues	1
me	1
well,	1
and	1
I	1
haue	1
giuen	1
him	1
Reasons,	1
Send	1
him	1
but	1
hither,	1
and	1
Ile	1
fashion	1
him	1
Cas.	1
The	1
morning	1
comes	1
vpon's:	1
Wee'l	1
leaue	1
you	1
Brutus,	1
And	1
Friends	1
disperse	1
your	1
selues;	1
but	1
all	1
remember	1
What	1
you	1
haue	1
said,	1
and	1
shew	1
your	1
selues	1
true	1
Romans	1
Bru.	1
Good	1
Gentlemen,	1
looke	1
fresh	1
and	1
merrily,	1
Let	1
not	1
our	1
lookes	1
put	1
on	1
our	1
purposes,	1
But	1
beare	1
it	1
as	1
our	1
Roman	1
Actors	1
do,	1
With	1
vntyr'd	1
Spirits,	1
and	1
formall	1
Constancie,	1
And	1
so	1
good	1
morrow	1
to	1
you	1
euery	1

Exeunt.	1
Manet	1
Brutus.	1
Boy:	1
Lucius:	1
Fast	1
asleepe?	1
It	1
is	1
no	1
matter,	1
Enioy	1
the	1
hony-heauy-Dew	1
of	1
Slumber:	1
Thou	1
hast	1
no	1
Figures,	1
nor	1
no	1
Fantasies,	1
Which	1
busie	1
care	1
drawes,	1
in	1
the	1
braines	1
of	1
men;	1
Therefore	1
thou	1
sleep'st	1
so	1
sound.	1
Enter	1
Portia.	1
Por.	1
Brutus,	1
my	1
Lord	1
Bru.	1
Portia:	1
What	1
meane	1
you?	1
wherfore	1
rise	1
you	1
now?	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
for	1
your	1
health,	1
thus	1
to	1
commit	1
Your	1
weake	1
condition,	1
to	1
the	1
raw	1
cold	1
morning	1
Por.	1
Nor	1
for	1
yours	1
neither.	1
Y'haue	1
vngently	1
Brutus	1
Stole	1
from	1
my	1
bed:	1
and	1
yesternight	1
at	1
Supper	1
You	1
sodainly	1
arose,	1
and	1
walk'd	1
about,	1
Musing,	1
and	1
sighing,	1
with	1
your	1
armes	1
acrosse	1
And	1
when	1
I	1
ask'd	1
you	1
what	1
the	1
matter	1
was,	1
You	1
star'd	1
vpon	1
me,	1
with	1
vngentle	1
lookes.	1
I	1
vrg'd	1
you	1
further,	1
then	1
you	1
scratch'd	1
your	1
head,	1
And	1
too	1
impatiently	1
stampt	1
with	1
your	1
foote:	1
Yet	1
I	1
insisted,	1
yet	1
you	1
answer'd	1
not,	1
But	1
with	1
an	1
angry	1
wafter	1
of	1
your	1
hand	1
Gaue	1
signe	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
leaue	1
you:	1
So	1
I	1
did,	1
Fearing	1
to	1
strengthen	1
that	1
impatience	1
Which	1
seem'd	1
too	1
much	1
inkindled;	1
and	1
withall,	1
Hoping	1
it	1
was	1
but	1
an	1
effect	1
of	1
Humor,	1
Which	1
sometime	1
hath	1
his	1
houre	1
with	1
euery	1
man.	1
It	1
will	1
not	1
let	1
you	1
eate,	1
nor	1
talke,	1
nor	1
sleepe;	1
And	1
could	1
it	1
worke	1
so	1
much	1
vpon	1
your	1
shape,	1
As	1
it	1
hath	1
much	1
preuayl'd	1
on	1
your	1
Condition,	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
know	1
you	1
Brutus.	1
Deare	1
my	1
Lord,	1
Make	1
me	1
acquainted	1
with	1
your	1
cause	1
of	1
greefe	1
Bru.	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
well	1
in	1
health,	1
and	1
that	1
is	1
all	1
Por.	1
Brutus	1
is	1
wise,	1
and	1
were	1
he	1
not	1
in	1
health,	1
He	1
would	1
embrace	1
the	1
meanes	1
to	1
come	1
by	1
it	1
Bru.	1
Why	1
so	1
I	1
do:	1
good	1
Portia	1
go	1
to	1
bed	1
Por.	1
Is	1
Brutus	1
sicke?	1
And	1
is	1
it	1
Physicall	1
To	1
walke	1
vnbraced,	1
and	1
sucke	1
vp	1
the	1
humours	1
Of	1
the	1
danke	1
Morning?	1
What,	1
is	1
Brutus	1
sicke?	1
And	1
will	1
he	1
steale	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
wholsome	1
bed	1
To	1
dare	1
the	1
vile	1
contagion	1
of	1
the	1
Night?	1
And	1
tempt	1
the	1
Rhewmy,	1
and	1
vnpurged	1
Ayre,	1
To	1
adde	1
vnto	1
his	1
sicknesse?	1
No	1
my	1
Brutus,	1
You	1
haue	1
some	1
sicke	1
Offence	1
within	1
your	1
minde,	1
Which	1
by	1
the	1
Right	1
and	1
Vertue	1
of	1
my	1

I	1
ought	1
to	1

of:	1
And	1
vpon	1
my	1

I	1
charme	1
you,	1
by	1
my	1

commended	1
Beauty,	1
By	1
all	1

Loue,	1
and	1

Vow	1
Which	1

That	1

Why	1

Haue	1

Some	1

Within	1

Marriage,	1
tell	1

Is	1

I	1

Dwell	1

Of	1

If	1
it	1

You	1

If	1

Who's	1

Enter	1
a	1
Seruant.	1
Ser.	1
My	1
Lord	1
Caes	1
Go	1
bid	1
the	1
Priests	1
do	1
present	1
Sacrifice,	1
And	1
bring	1

of	1
Successe	1

I	1

my	1
Lord.	1
Exit	1
Enter	1
Calphurnia.	1
Cal.	1
What	1
mean	1
you	1
Caesar?	1
Think	1
you	1
to	1
walk	1
forth?	1
You	1
shall	1
not	1
stirre	1
out	1
of	1
your	1
house	1
to	1
day	1
Caes	1
Caesar	1
shall	1
forth;	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
threaten'd	1
me,	1
Ne're	1
look'd	1
but	1
on	1
my	1
backe:	1
When	1
they	1
shall	1
see	1
The	1
face	1
of	1
Caesar,	1
they	1
are	1
vanished	1
Calp.	1
Caesar,	1
I	1
neuer	1
stood	1
on	1
Ceremonies,	1
Yet	1
now	1
they	1
fright	1
me:	1
There	1
is	1
one	1
within,	1
Besides	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
we	1
haue	1
heard	1
and	1
seene,	1
Recounts	1
most	1
horrid	1
sights	1
seene	1
by	1
the	1
Watch.	1
A	1
Lionnesse	1
hath	1
whelped	1
in	1
the	1
streets,	1
And	1
Graues	1
haue	1
yawn'd,	1
and	1
yeelded	1
vp	1
their	1
dead;	1
Fierce	1
fiery	1
Warriours	1
fight	1
vpon	1
the	1
Clouds	1
In	1
Rankes	1
and	1
Squadrons,	1
and	1
right	1
forme	1
of	1
Warre	1
Which	1
drizel'd	1
blood	1
vpon	1
the	1
Capitoll:	1
The	1
noise	1
of	1
Battell	1
hurtled	1
in	1
the	1
Ayre:	1
Horsses	1
do	1
neigh,	1
and	1
dying	1
men	1
did	1
grone,	1
And	1
Ghosts	1
did	1
shrieke	1
and	1
squeale	1
about	1
the	1
streets.	1
O	1
Caesar,	1
these	1
things	1
are	1
beyond	1
all	1
vse,	1
And	1
I	1
do	1
feare	1
them	1
Caes	1
What	1
can	1
be	1
auoyded	1
Whose	1
end	1
is	1
purpos'd	1
by	1
the	1
mighty	1
Gods?	1
Yet	1
Caesar	1
shall	1
go	1
forth:	1
for	1
these	1
Predictions	1
Are	1
to	1
the	1
world	1
in	1
generall,	1
as	1
to	1
Caesar	1
Calp.	1
When	1
Beggers	1
dye,	1
there	1
are	1
no	1
Comets	1
seen,	1
The	1
Heauens	1
themselues	1
blaze	1
forth	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
Princes	1
Caes	1
Cowards	1
dye	1
many	1
times	1
before	1
their	1
deaths,	1
The	1
valiant	1
neuer	1
taste	1
of	1
death	1
but	1
once:	1
Of	1
all	1
the	1
Wonders	1
that	1
I	1
yet	1
haue	1
heard,	1
It	1
seemes	1
to	1
me	1
most	1
strange	1
that	1
men	1
should	1
feare,	1
Seeing	1
that	1
death,	1
a	1
necessary	1
end	1
Will	1
come,	1
when	1
it	1
will	1
come.	1
Enter	1
a	1
Seruant.	1
What	1
say	1
the	1
Augurers?	1
Ser.	1
They	1
would	1
not	1
haue	1
you	1
to	1
stirre	1
forth	1
to	1
day.	1
Plucking	1
the	1
intrailes	1
of	1
an	1
Offering	1
forth,	1
They	1
could	1
not	1
finde	1
a	1
heart	1
within	1
the	1
beast	1
Caes	1
The	1
Gods	1
do	1
this	1
in	1
shame	1
of	1
Cowardice:	1
Caesar	1
should	1
be	1
a	1
Beast	1
without	1
a	1
heart	1
If	1
he	1
should	1
stay	1
at	1
home	1
to	1
day	1
for	1
feare:	1
No	1
Caesar	1
shall	1
not;	1
Danger	1
knowes	1
full	1
well	1
That	1
Caesar	1
is	1
more	1
dangerous	1
then	1
he.	1
We	1
heare	1
two	1
Lyons	1
litter'd	1
in	1
one	1
day,	1
And	1
I	1
the	1
elder	1
and	1
more	1
terrible,	1
And	1
Caesar	1
shall	1
go	1
foorth	1
Calp.	1
Alas	1
my	1
Lord,	1
Your	1
wisedome	1
is	1
consum'd	1
in	1
confidence:	1
Do	1
not	1
go	1
forth	1
to	1
day:	1
Call	1
it	1
my	1
feare,	1
That	1
keepes	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
not	1
your	1
owne.	1
Wee'l	1
send	1
Mark	1
Antony	1
to	1
the	1
Senate	1
house,	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
say,	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
well	1
to	1
day:	1
Let	1
me	1
vpon	1
my	1
knee,	1
preuaile	1
in	1
this	1
Caes	1
Mark	1
Antony	1
shall	1
say	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
well,	1
And	1
for	1
thy	1
humor,	1
I	1
will	1
stay	1
at	1
home.	1
Enter	1
Decius.	1
Heere's	1
Decius	1
Brutus,	1
he	1
shall	1
tell	1
them	1
so	1
Deci.	1
Caesar,	1

Good	1

worthy	1
Caesar,	1
I	1
come	1
to	1
fetch	1
you	1
to	1
the	1
Senate	1
house	1
Caes	1
And	1
you	1
are	1
come	1
in	1
very	1
happy	1
time,	1
To	1
beare	1
my	1
greeting	1
to	1
the	1
Senators,	1
And	1
tell	1
them	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
come	1
to	1
day:	1
Cannot,	1
is	1
false:	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
dare	1
not,	1
falser:	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
come	1
to	1
day,	1
tell	1
them	1
so	1
Decius	1
Calp.	1
Say	1
he	1
is	1
sicke	1
Caes	1
Shall	1
Caesar	1
send	1
a	1
Lye?	1
Haue	1
I	1
in	1
Conquest	1
stretcht	1
mine	1
Arme	1
so	1
farre,	1
To	1
be	1
afear'd	1
to	1
tell	1
Gray-beards	1
the	1
truth:	1
Decius,	1
go	1
tell	1
them,	1
Caesar	1
will	1
not	1
come	1
Deci.	1
Most	1
mighty	1
Caesar,	1
let	1
me	1
know	1
some	1
cause,	1
Lest	1
I	1
be	1
laught	1
at	1
when	1
I	1
tell	1
them	1
so	1
Caes	1
The	1
cause	1
is	1
in	1
my	1
Will,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
come,	1
That	1
is	1
enough	1
to	1
satisfie	1
the	1
Senate.	1
But	1
for	1
your	1
priuate	1
satisfaction,	1
Because	1
I	1
loue	1
you,	1
I	1
will	1
let	1
you	1
know.	1
Calphurnia	1
heere	1
my	1
wife,	1
stayes	1
me	1
at	1
home:	1
She	1
dreampt	1
to	1
night,	1
she	1
saw	1
my	1
Statue,	1
Which	1
like	1
a	1
Fountaine,	1
with	1
an	1
hundred	1
spouts	1
Did	1
run	1
pure	1
blood:	1
and	1
many	1
lusty	1
Romans	1
Came	1
smiling,	1
&	1
did	1
bathe	1
their	1
hands	1
in	1
it:	1
And	1
these	1
does	1
she	1
apply,	1
for	1
warnings	1
and	1
portents,	1
And	1
euils	1
imminent;	1
and	1
on	1
her	1
knee	1
Hath	1
begg'd,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
stay	1
at	1
home	1
to	1
day	1
Deci.	1
This	1
Dreame	1
is	1
all	1
amisse	1
interpreted,	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
vision,	1
faire	1
and	1
fortunate:	1
Your	1
Statue	1
spouting	1
blood	1
in	1
many	1
pipes,	1
In	1
which	1
so	1
many	1
smiling	1
Romans	1
bath'd,	1
Signifies,	1
that	1
from	1
you	1
great	1
Rome	1
shall	1
sucke	1
Reuiuing	1
blood,	1
and	1
that	1
great	1
men	1
shall	1
presse	1
For	1
Tinctures,	1
Staines,	1
Reliques,	1
and	1
Cognisance.	1
This	1
by	1
Calphurnia's	1
Dreame	1
is	1
signified	1
Caes	1
And	1
this	1
way	1
haue	1
you	1
well	1
expounded	1
it	1
Deci.	1
I	1
haue,	1
when	1
you	1

what	1
I	1
can	1
say:	1
And	1

Senate	1
haue	1
concluded	1
To	1
giue	1
this	1
day,	1

Crowne	1
to	1

If	1
you	1
shall	1
send	1
them	1
word	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
come,	1
Their	1
mindes	1
may	1
change.	1
Besides,	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
mocke	1
Apt	1
to	1
be	1
render'd,	1
for	1
some	1
one	1
to	1
say,	1
Breake	1
vp	1
the	1
Senate,	1
till	1
another	1
time:	1
When	1
Caesars	1
wife	1
shall	1
meete	1
with	1
better	1
Dreames.	1
If	1
Caesar	1
hide	1
himselfe,	1
shall	1
they	1
not	1
whisper	1
Loe	1
Caesar	1
is	1
affraid?	1
Pardon	1

To	1

How	1

fears	1

I	1

Vertue	1

If	1

Prayers	1

But	1
I	1
am	1

as	1

Northerne	1
Starre,	1
Of	1

true	1
fixt,	1

resting	1
quality,	1
There	1
is	1
no	1

The	1

They	1

But,	1
there's	1

And	1

Where's	1

Heere,	1

Met.	1
Stand	1

some	1
Friend	1
of	1

Should	1

There	1

Nor	1

so	1
tell	1
them	1
Publius	1
Cassi.	1
And	1
leaue	1
vs	1
Publius,	1

that	1
the	1

Rushing	1

Bru.	1
Do	1
so,	1
and	1
let	1
no	1

But	1

the	1
Doers.	1
Enter	1
Trebonius	1
Cassi.	1
Where	1
is	1
Antony?	1
Treb.	1
Fled	1
to	1
his	1
House	1
amaz'd:	1
Men,	1
Wiues,	1

Children,	1
stare,	1
cry	1
out,	1
and	1
run,	1
As	1
it	1
were	1
Doomesday	1
Bru.	1
Fates,	1
we	1
will	1
know	1
your	1
pleasures:	1
That	1
we	1

we	1

'tis	1
but	1
the	1
time	1
And	1
drawing	1
dayes	1
out,	1
that	1

stand	1
vpon	1
Cask.	1
Why	1
he	1
that	1
cuts	1
off	1
twenty	1
yeares	1
of	1
life,	1
Cuts	1
off	1
so	1
many	1
yeares	1
of	1
fearing	1
death	1
Bru.	1
Grant	1
that,	1
and	1
then	1
is	1
Death	1
a	1
Benefit:	1
So	1
are	1
we	1
Caesars	1
Friends,	1
that	1
haue	1
abridg'd	1
His	1
time	1
of	1
fearing	1
death.	1
Stoope	1
Romans,	1
stoope,	1
And	1
let	1

in	1
Caesars	1
blood	1
Vp	1
to	1
the	1
Elbowes,	1
and	1
besmeare	1
our	1

Then	1
walke	1

forth,	1
euen	1
to	1
the	1
Market	1

And	1
wauing	1
our	1

Weapons	1
o're	1

Let's	1
all	1
cry	1
Peace,	1
Freedome,	1
and	1
Liberty	1
Cassi.	1
Stoop	1
then,	1
and	1
wash.	1
How	1
many	1
Ages	1
hence	1
Shall	1
this	1
our	1
lofty	1
Scene	1
be	1
acted	1
ouer,	1
In	1
State	1
vnborne,	1
and	1
Accents	1
yet	1
vnknowne?	1
Bru.	1
How	1
many	1
times	1
shall	1
Caesar	1
bleed	1
in	1
sport,	1
That	1
now	1
on	1
Pompeyes	1
Basis	1
lye	1
along,	1
No	1
worthier	1
then	1
the	1
dust?	1
Cassi.	1
So	1
oft	1
as	1
that	1
shall	1
be,	1
So	1
often	1
shall	1
the	1
knot	1
of	1

be	1
call'd,	1
The	1
Men	1
that	1
gaue	1
their	1
Country	1
liberty	1
Dec.	1
What,	1
shall	1
we	1
forth?	1
Cassi.	1
I,	1
euery	1
man	1
away.	1
Brutus	1
shall	1
leade,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
grace	1
his	1
heeles	1
With	1
the	1
most	1
boldest,	1
and	1
best	1
hearts	1
of	1
Rome.	1
Enter	1
a	1
Seruant.	1
Bru.	1
Soft,	1
who	1
comes	1
heere?	1
A	1
friend	1
of	1
Antonies	1
Ser.	1
Thus	1
Brutus	1
did	1
my	1
Master	1
bid	1
me	1
kneele;	1
Thus	1
did	1
Mark	1
Antony	1
bid	1
me	1
fall	1
downe,	1
And	1
being	1
prostrate,	1
thus	1
he	1
bad	1
me	1
say:	1
Brutus	1
is	1
Noble,	1
Wise,	1
Valiant,	1
and	1
Honest;	1
Caesar	1
was	1
Mighty,	1
Bold,	1
Royall,	1
and	1
Louing:	1
Say,	1
I	1
loue	1
Brutus,	1
and	1
I	1
honour	1
him;	1
Say,	1
I	1
fear'd	1
Caesar,	1
honour'd	1
him,	1
and	1
lou'd	1
him.	1
If	1
Brutus	1
will	1
vouchsafe,	1
that	1
Antony	1
May	1
safely	1
come	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
be	1
resolu'd	1
How	1
Caesar	1
hath	1
deseru'd	1
to	1
lye	1
in	1
death,	1
Mark	1
Antony,	1
shall	1
not	1
loue	1
Caesar	1
dead	1
So	1
well	1
as	1
Brutus	1
liuing;	1
but	1
will	1
follow	1
The	1
Fortunes	1
and	1
Affayres	1
of	1
Noble	1
Brutus,	1
Thorough	1
the	1
hazards	1
of	1
this	1
vntrod	1
State,	1
With	1
all	1
true	1
Faith.	1
So	1
sayes	1
my	1
Master	1
Antony	1
Bru.	1
Thy	1
Master	1
is	1
a	1
Wise	1
and	1
Valiant	1
Romane,	1
I	1
neuer	1
thought	1
him	1
worse:	1
Tell	1
him,	1
so	1
please	1
him	1
come	1
vnto	1
this	1
place	1
He	1
shall	1
be	1
satisfied:	1
and	1
by	1
my	1
Honor	1
Depart	1
vntouch'd	1
Ser.	1
Ile	1
fetch	1
him	1
presently.	1
Exit	1
Seruant.	1
Bru.	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
we	1
shall	1
haue	1
him	1
well	1
to	1
Friend	1
Cassi.	1
I	1
wish	1
we	1
may:	1
But	1
yet	1
haue	1
I	1
a	1
minde	1
That	1
feares	1
him	1
much:	1
and	1
my	1
misgiuing	1
still	1
Falles	1
shrewdly	1
to	1
the	1
purpose.	1
Enter	1
Antony.	1
Bru.	1
But	1
heere	1
comes	1
Antony:	1
Welcome	1
Mark	1
Antony	1
Ant.	1
O	1
mighty	1
Caesar!	1
Dost	1
thou	1
lye	1
so	1
lowe?	1
Are	1
all	1
thy	1
Conquests,	1
Glories,	1
Triumphes,	1
Spoiles,	1
Shrunke	1
to	1
this	1
little	1
Measure?	1
Fare	1
thee	1
well.	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
Gentlemen	1
what	1
you	1
intend,	1
Who	1
else	1
must	1
be	1
let	1
blood,	1
who	1
else	1
is	1
ranke:	1
If	1
I	1
my	1
selfe,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
houre	1
so	1
fit	1
As	1
Caesars	1
deaths	1
houre;	1
nor	1
no	1
Instrument	1
Of	1
halfe	1
that	1
worth,	1
as	1
those	1
your	1
Swords;	1
made	1
rich	1
With	1
the	1
most	1
Noble	1
blood	1
of	1
all	1
this	1
World.	1
I	1
do	1
beseech	1
yee,	1
if	1
you	1
beare	1
me	1
hard,	1
Now,	1
whil'st	1
your	1
purpled	1
hands	1
do	1
reeke	1
and	1
smoake,	1
Fulfill	1
your	1
pleasure.	1
Liue	1
a	1
thousand	1
yeeres,	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
finde	1
my	1
selfe	1
so	1
apt	1
to	1
dye.	1
No	1
place	1
will	1
please	1
me	1
so,	1
no	1
meane	1
of	1
death,	1
As	1
heere	1
by	1
Caesar,	1
and	1
by	1
you	1
cut	1
off,	1
The	1
Choice	1
and	1
Master	1
Spirits	1
of	1
this	1
Age	1
Bru.	1
O	1
Antony!	1
Begge	1
not	1
your	1
death	1
of	1
vs:	1
Though	1
now	1
we	1
must	1
appeare	1
bloody	1
and	1
cruell,	1
As	1
by	1
our	1
hands,	1
and	1
this	1
our	1
present	1
Acte	1
You	1
see	1
we	1
do:	1
Yet	1
see	1
you	1
but	1
our	1
hands,	1
And	1
this,	1
the	1
bleeding	1
businesse	1
they	1
haue	1
done:	1
Our	1
hearts	1
you	1
see	1
not,	1
they	1
are	1
pittifull:	1

For	1

To	1

In	1

Wisedome:	1
Let	1

First	1
Marcus	1

Next	1
Caius	1

yours	1

Trebonius.	1
Gentlemen	1
all:	1
Alas,	1
what	1
shall	1
I	1
say,	1
My	1
credit	1
now	1
stands	1
on	1
such	1
slippery	1
ground,	1
That	1
one	1
of	1
two	1
bad	1
wayes	1
you	1
must	1
conceit	1
me,	1
Either	1
a	1
Coward,	1
or	1
a	1
Flatterer.	1
That	1
I	1
did	1
loue	1
thee	1
Caesar,	1
O	1
'tis	1
true:	1
If	1
then	1
thy	1
Spirit	1
looke	1
vpon	1
vs	1
now,	1
Shall	1
it	1
not	1
greeue	1
thee	1
deerer	1
then	1
thy	1
death,	1
To	1
see	1
thy	1
Antony	1
making	1
his	1
peace,	1
Shaking	1
the	1
bloody	1
fingers	1
of	1
thy	1
Foes?	1
Most	1
Noble,	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
thy	1
Coarse,	1
Had	1
I	1
as	1
many	1
eyes,	1
as	1
thou	1
hast	1
wounds,	1
Weeping	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
they	1
streame	1
forth	1
thy	1
blood,	1
It	1
would	1
become	1
me	1
better,	1
then	1
to	1
close	1
In	1
tearmes	1
of	1
Friendship	1
with	1
thine	1

Pardon	1
me	1
Iulius,	1
heere	1
was't	1
thou	1
bay'd	1
braue	1

Heere	1
did'st	1

Hunters	1

Sign'd	1

Crimson'd	1

O	1

this	1
Hart,	1
And	1
this	1
indeed,	1
O	1

How	1

Princes,	1
Dost	1

Mark	1
Antony	1
Ant.	1
Pardon	1
me	1
Caius	1
Cassius:	1
The	1
Enemies	1
of	1
Caesar,	1
shall	1
say	1
this:	1
Then,	1
in	1
a	1
Friend,	1
it	1
is	1
cold	1
Modestie	1
Cassi.	1
I	1
blame	1
you	1
not	1
for	1
praising	1
Caesar	1
so.	1
But	1
what	1
compact	1
meane	1
you	1
to	1
haue	1
with	1
vs?	1
Will	1
you	1
be	1
prick'd	1
in	1
number	1
of	1
our	1
Friends,	1
Or	1
shall	1
we	1
on,	1
and	1
not	1
depend	1
on	1
you?	1
Ant.	1
Therefore	1
I	1
tooke	1
your	1
hands,	1
but	1
was	1
indeed	1
Sway'd	1
from	1
the	1
point,	1
by	1
looking	1
downe	1
on	1
Caesar.	1
Friends	1
am	1
I	1
with	1
you	1
all,	1
and	1
loue	1
you	1

Vpon	1
this	1
hope,	1
that	1
you	1
shall	1
giue	1
me	1
Reasons,	1
Why,	1
and	1
wherein,	1
Caesar	1
was	1
dangerous	1
Bru.	1
Or	1
else	1
were	1
this	1
a	1
sauage	1
Spectacle:	1
Our	1
Reasons	1
are	1
so	1
full	1
of	1
good	1
regard,	1
That	1
were	1
you	1
Antony,	1
the	1
Sonne	1
of	1
Caesar,	1
You	1
should	1
be	1
satisfied	1
Ant.	1
That's	1
all	1
I	1
seeke,	1
And	1
am	1
moreouer	1
sutor,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
Produce	1
his	1
body	1
to	1
the	1
Market-place,	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
Pulpit	1
as	1
becomes	1
a	1
Friend,	1
Speake	1
in	1
the	1
Order	1
of	1
his	1
Funerall	1
Bru.	1
You	1
shall	1
Marke	1
Antony	1
Cassi.	1
Brutus,	1
a	1
word	1
with	1
you:	1
You	1
know	1
not	1
what	1
you	1
do;	1
Do	1
not	1
consent	1
That	1
Antony	1
speake	1
in	1
his	1
Funerall:	1
Know	1
you	1
how	1
much	1
the	1
people	1
may	1
be	1
mou'd	1
By	1
that	1
which	1
he	1
will	1
vtter	1
Bru.	1
By	1
your	1
pardon:	1
I	1
will	1

selfe	1

the	1
Pulpit	1
first,	1
And	1
shew	1
the	1
reason	1
of	1
our	1
Caesars	1
death.	1
What	1
Antony	1
shall	1
speake,	1
I	1
will	1
protest	1
He	1
speakes	1
by	1
leaue,	1
and	1
by	1
permission:	1
And	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
contented	1
Caesar	1
shall	1
Haue	1
all	1
true	1
Rites,	1
and	1
lawfull	1
Ceremonies,	1
It	1
shall	1
aduantage	1
more,	1
then	1
do	1

I	1
know	1

I	1
like	1

not	1
Bru.	1
Mark	1

You	1

But	1
speake	1
all	1
good	1
you	1
can	1
deuise	1
of	1
Caesar,	1
And	1
say	1
you	1
doo't	1
by	1
our	1
permission:	1
Else	1
shall	1
you	1
not	1
haue	1
any	1
hand	1
at	1
all	1
About	1
his	1
Funerall.	1
And	1
you	1
shall	1
speake	1
In	1
the	1
same	1
Pulpit	1
whereto	1
I	1
am	1
going,	1
After	1
my	1
speech	1
is	1
ended	1
Ant.	1
Be	1
it	1
so:	1
I	1
do	1
desire	1
no	1

Prepare	1

The	1
Noble	1

is	1

Silence	1
Bru.	1
Be	1

Romans,	1
Countrey-men,	1

Louers,	1
heare	1
mee	1
for	1
my	1
cause,	1
and	1
be	1
silent,	1
that	1
you	1
may	1

Beleeue	1

Honor,	1
and	1
haue	1
respect	1

Honor,	1
that	1
you	1

Censure	1
me	1
in	1

and	1
awake	1
your	1
Senses,	1
that	1
you	1
may	1

Iudge.	1
If	1
there	1
bee	1
any	1
in	1
this	1
Assembly,	1
any	1
deere	1
Friend	1
of	1
Caesars,	1
to	1
him	1
I	1
say,	1
that	1
Brutus	1
loue	1
to	1
Caesar,	1
was	1
no	1
lesse	1
then	1
his.	1
If	1
then,	1
that	1
Friend	1
demand,	1
why	1
Brutus	1
rose	1
against	1
Caesar,	1
this	1
is	1
my	1
answer:	1
Not	1
that	1
I	1
lou'd	1
Caesar	1
lesse,	1
but	1
that	1
I	1
lou'd	1
Rome	1
more.	1
Had	1
you	1
rather	1
Caesar	1
were	1
liuing,	1
and	1
dye	1
all	1
Slaues;	1
then	1
that	1
Caesar	1
were	1
dead,	1
to	1
liue	1
all	1
Free-men?	1
As	1
Caesar	1
lou'd	1
mee,	1
I	1
weepe	1
for	1
him;	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
Fortunate,	1
I	1
reioyce	1
at	1
it;	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
Valiant,	1
I	1
honour	1
him:	1
But,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
Ambitious,	1
I	1
slew	1
him.	1
There	1
is	1
Teares,	1
for	1
his	1
Loue:	1
Ioy,	1
for	1
his	1
Fortune:	1
Honor,	1
for	1
his	1
Valour:	1
and	1
Death,	1
for	1
his	1
Ambition.	1
Who	1
is	1
heere	1
so	1
base,	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
Bondman?	1
If	1
any,	1
speak,	1
for	1
him	1
haue	1
I	1
offended.	1
Who	1
is	1
heere	1
so	1
rude,	1
that	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
a	1
Roman?	1
If	1
any,	1
speak,	1
for	1
him	1
haue	1
I	1
offended.	1
Who	1
is	1
heere	1
so	1
vile,	1
that	1
will	1
not	1
loue	1
his	1
Countrey?	1
If	1
any,	1
speake,	1
for	1
him	1
haue	1
I	1
offended.	1
I	1
pause	1
for	1
a	1
Reply	1
All.	1
None	1
Brutus,	1
none	1
Brutus.	1
Then	1
none	1
haue	1
I	1
offended.	1
I	1
haue	1
done	1
no	1
more	1
to	1
Caesar,	1
then	1
you	1
shall	1
do	1
to	1
Brutus.	1
The	1
Question	1
of	1
his	1
death,	1
is	1
inroll'd	1
in	1
the	1
Capitoll:	1
his	1
Glory	1
not	1
extenuated,	1
wherein	1
he	1
was	1
worthy;	1
nor	1
his	1
offences	1
enforc'd,	1
for	1
which	1
he	1
suffered	1
death.	1
Enter	1
Mark	1
Antony,	1
with	1
Caesars	1
body.	1
Heere	1
comes	1
his	1
Body,	1
mourn'd	1
by	1
Marke	1
Antony,	1
who	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
hand	1
in	1
his	1
death,	1
shall	1
receiue	1
the	1
benefit	1
of	1
his	1
dying,	1
a	1
place	1
in	1
the	1
Co[m]monwealth,	1
as	1
which	1
of	1
you	1
shall	1
not.	1
With	1
this	1
I	1
depart,	1
that	1
as	1
I	1
slewe	1
my	1
best	1
Louer	1
for	1
the	1
good	1
of	1
Rome,	1
I	1
haue	1
the	1
same	1
Dagger	1
for	1
my	1
selfe,	1
when	1
it	1
shall	1
please	1
my	1
Country	1
to	1
need	1
my	1
death	1
All.	1
Liue	1
Brutus,	1
liue,	1
liue	1
1.	1
Bring	1
him	1
with	1
Triumph	1
home	1
vnto	1
his	1

Friends,	1
Romans,	1
Countrymen,	1
lend	1
me	1
your	1
ears:	1
I	1
come	1
to	1
bury	1
Caesar,	1
not	1
to	1
praise	1
him:	1
The	1
euill	1
that	1
men	1
do,	1
liues	1
after	1
them,	1
The	1
good	1
is	1
oft	1
enterred	1
with	1
their	1
bones,	1
So	1
let	1
it	1
be	1
with	1
Caesar.	1
The	1
Noble	1
Brutus,	1
Hath	1
told	1
you	1
Caesar	1
was	1
Ambitious:	1
If	1
it	1
were	1
so,	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
greeuous	1
Fault,	1
And	1
greeuously	1
hath	1
Caesar	1
answer'd	1
it.	1
Heere,	1
vnder	1
leaue	1
of	1
Brutus,	1
and	1
the	1
rest	1
(For	1
Brutus	1
is	1
an	1
Honourable	1
man,	1
So	1
are	1
they	1
all;	1
all	1
Honourable	1
men)	1
Come	1
I	1
to	1
speake	1
in	1
Caesars	1
Funerall.	1
He	1
was	1
my	1
Friend,	1
faithfull,	1
and	1
iust	1
to	1
me;	1
But	1
Brutus	1
sayes,	1
he	1
was	1
Ambitious,	1
And	1
Brutus	1
is	1
an	1
Honourable	1
man.	1
He	1
hath	1
brought	1
many	1
Captiues	1
home	1
to	1
Rome,	1
Whose	1
Ransomes,	1
did	1
the	1
generall	1
Coffers	1
fill:	1
Did	1
this	1
in	1
Caesar	1
seeme	1
Ambitious?	1
When	1
that	1
the	1
poore	1
haue	1
cry'de,	1
Caesar	1
hath	1
wept:	1
Ambition	1
should	1
be	1
made	1
of	1
sterner	1
stuffe,	1
Yet	1
Brutus	1
sayes,	1
he	1
was	1
Ambitious:	1
And	1
Brutus	1
is	1
an	1
Honourable	1
man.	1
You	1
all	1
did	1
see,	1
that	1
on	1
the	1
Lupercall,	1
I	1
thrice	1
presented	1
him	1
a	1
Kingly	1
Crowne,	1
Which	1
he	1
did	1
thrice	1
refuse.	1
Was	1
this	1
Ambition?	1
Yet	1
Brutus	1
sayes,	1
he	1
was	1
Ambitious:	1
And	1
sure	1
he	1
is	1
an	1
Honourable	1
man.	1
I	1
speake	1
not	1
to	1
disprooue	1
what	1
Brutus	1
spoke,	1
But	1
heere	1
I	1
am,	1
to	1
speake	1
what	1
I	1
do	1
know;	1
You	1
all	1
did	1
loue	1
him	1
once,	1
not	1
without	1
cause,	1
What	1
cause	1
with-holds	1
you	1
then,	1
to	1
mourne	1
for	1
him?	1
O	1
Iudgement!	1
thou	1
are	1
fled	1
to	1
brutish	1
Beasts,	1
And	1
Men	1
haue	1
lost	1
their	1
Reason.	1
Beare	1
with	1
me,	1
My	1
heart	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
Coffin	1
there	1
with	1
Caesar,	1
And	1
I	1
must	1
pawse,	1
till	1
it	1
come	1
backe	1
to	1
me	1
1	1
Me	1
thinkes	1
there	1
is	1
much	1
reason	1
in	1
his	1
sayings	1
2	1
If	1
thou	1
consider	1
rightly	1
of	1
the	1
matter,	1
Caesar	1
ha's	1
had	1
great	1
wrong	1
3	1
Ha's	1
hee	1
Masters?	1
I	1
feare	1
there	1
will	1
a	1
worse	1
come	1
in	1
his	1
place	1
4.	1
Mark'd	1
ye	1
his	1
words?	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
take	1
y	1
Crown,	1
Therefore	1
'tis	1
certaine,	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
Ambitious	1
1.	1
If	1
it	1
be	1
found	1
so,	1
some	1
will	1
deere	1
abide	1
it	1
2.	1
Poore	1
soule,	1
his	1
eyes	1
are	1
red	1
as	1
fire	1
with	1
weeping	1
3.	1
There's	1
not	1
a	1
Nobler	1
man	1
in	1
Rome	1
then	1
Antony	1
4.	1
Now	1
marke	1
him,	1
he	1
begins	1
againe	1
to	1
speake	1
Ant.	1
But	1
yesterday,	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
Caesar	1
might	1
Haue	1
stood	1
against	1
the	1
World:	1
Now	1
lies	1
he	1
there,	1
And	1
none	1
so	1
poore	1
to	1
do	1
him	1
reuerence.	1
O	1
Maisters!	1
If	1
I	1
were	1
dispos'd	1
to	1
stirre	1
Your	1
hearts	1
and	1
mindes	1
to	1
Mutiny	1
and	1
Rage,	1
I	1
should	1
do	1
Brutus	1
wrong,	1
and	1
Cassius	1
wrong:	1
Who	1
(you	1
all	1
know)	1
are	1
Honourable	1
men.	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
do	1
them	1
wrong:	1
I	1
rather	1
choose	1
To	1
wrong	1
the	1
dead,	1
to	1
wrong	1
my	1
selfe	1
and	1
you,	1
Then	1
I	1
will	1
wrong	1
such	1
Honourable	1
men.	1
But	1
heere's	1
a	1
Parchment,	1
with	1
the	1
Seale	1
of	1
Caesar,	1
I	1
found	1

And	1

Yea,	1

The	1

'Twas	1
on	1
a	1
Summers	1
Euening	1
in	1

That	1

he	1
ouercame	1
the	1

Looke,	1
in	1

ran	1
Cassius	1

Through	1

wel-beloued	1
Brutus	1
stabb'd,	1
And	1
as	1

pluck'd	1
his	1

Marke	1
how	1
the	1

of	1
Caesar	1
followed	1
it,	1
As	1
rushing	1
out	1
of	1

to	1
be	1

If	1
Brutus	1
so	1
vnkindely	1

For	1

was	1
Caesars	1
Angel.	1
Iudge,	1
O	1
you	1
Gods,	1
how	1
deerely	1
Caesar	1
lou'd	1

This	1
was	1
the	1
most	1
vnkindest	1
cut	1

For	1
when	1
the	1
Noble	1
Caesar	1
saw	1

stab,	1
Ingratitude,	1
more	1
strong	1
then	1
Traitors	1
armes,	1
Quite	1
vanquish'd	1

then	1
burst	1

Mighty	1

And	1

And	1
hauing	1

Then	1

You	1

But	1
hee's	1
a	1

Souldier	1
Ant.	1
So	1
is	1
my	1
Horse	1
Octauius,	1
and	1
for	1
that	1
I	1
do	1
appoint	1
him	1

It	1
is	1
a	1
Creature	1
that	1
I	1
teach	1
to	1
fight,	1
To	1
winde,	1
to	1
stop,	1
to	1
run	1
directly	1
on:	1
His	1
corporall	1
Motion,	1
gouern'd	1
by	1
my	1
Spirit,	1
And	1
in	1
some	1
taste,	1
is	1
Lepidus	1
but	1
so:	1
He	1
must	1
be	1
taught,	1
and	1
train'd,	1
and	1
bid	1
go	1
forth:	1
A	1
barren	1
spirited	1
Fellow;	1
one	1
that	1
feeds	1
On	1
Obiects,	1
Arts,	1
and	1
Imitations.	1
Which	1
out	1
of	1

stal'de	1
by	1
other	1

Begin	1
his	1

Do	1
not	1

But	1
as	1
a	1

and	1
now	1
Octauius,	1
Listen	1
great	1
things.	1
Brutus	1
and	1
Cassius	1
Are	1
leuying	1
Powers;	1
We	1
must	1
straight	1
make	1

Therefore	1
let	1
our	1
Alliance	1

combin'd,	1
Our	1

And	1

How	1

disclos'd,	1
And	1
open	1
Perils	1
surest	1

Octa.	1
Let	1
vs	1
do	1
so:	1
for	1
we	1
are	1
at	1
the	1
stake,	1
And	1
bayed	1
about	1
with	1
many	1
Enemies,	1
And	1
some	1
that	1

Millions	1

Exeunt.	1

To	1

In	1

Hath	1

But	1

I	1

Such	1

A	1

With	1

Nor	1

As	1

Thou	1

A	1

Lucillius,	1
When	1
Loue	1

It	1
vseth	1
an	1
enforced	1
Ceremony.	1
There	1
are	1
no	1

in	1
plaine	1

Faith:	1
But	1
hollow	1

Make	1

They	1

Brutus,	1

And	1

Speake	1

Before	1

Let	1

A	1

Cassi.	1
That	1
you	1

doth	1
appear	1
in	1
this:	1
You	1

condemn'd,	1

Because	1

In	1

Let	1

Or	1

The	1

Honors	1

And	1

Remember	1
March,	1
the	1
Ides	1
of	1
March	1
reme[m]ber:	1
Did	1
not	1
great	1
Iulius	1
bleede	1
for	1
Iustice	1
sake?	1
What	1
Villaine	1
touch'd	1
his	1
body,	1
that	1
did	1
stab,	1
And	1
not	1
for	1
Iustice?	1
What?	1
Shall	1

the	1
Formost	1

World,	1
But	1
for	1
supporting	1
Robbers:	1
shall	1
we	1
now,	1
Contaminate	1
our	1
fingers,	1
with	1
base	1
Bribes?	1
And	1
sell	1
the	1
mighty	1
space	1
of	1
our	1
large	1
Honors	1
For	1
so	1
much	1
trash,	1
as	1
may	1
be	1
grasped	1
thus?	1
I	1
had	1
rather	1
be	1
a	1
Dogge,	1
and	1
bay	1
the	1
Moone,	1
Then	1
such	1
a	1
Roman	1
Cassi.	1

Ile	1

To	1

I	1

Souldier,	1

Older	1

Abler	1

To	1

Go	1

Tempt	1

Is't	1

Bru.	1
Heare	1

Must	1
I	1

Choller?	1
Shall	1
I	1

Cassi.	1
O	1

Gods,	1

Gods,	1
Must	1
I	1
endure	1
all	1
this?	1
Bru.	1
All	1

Fret	1
till	1

break.	1
Go	1
shew	1

Slaues	1
how	1
Chollericke	1

And	1
make	1
your	1
Bondmen	1

Must	1

Must	1
I	1
obserue	1

Must	1
I	1
stand	1
and	1
crouch	1
Vnder	1

Testie	1
Humour?	1
By	1
the	1
Gods,	1
You	1

digest	1
the	1
Venom	1
of	1
your	1
Spleene	1
Though	1

Split	1

For,	1
from	1
this	1

forth,	1
Ile	1
vse	1

Mirth,	1
yea	1

Laughter	1
When	1

Is	1
it	1
come	1

this?	1
Bru.	1
You	1

a	1

Souldier:	1
Let	1
it	1
appeare	1
so;	1
make	1
your	1
vaunting	1
true,	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
please	1
me	1
well.	1
For	1
mine	1
owne	1
part,	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
glad	1
to	1
learne	1
of	1
Noble	1

Cass.	1
You	1

You	1
wrong	1

Brutus:	1
I	1
saide,	1
an	1
Elder	1
Souldier,	1
not	1
a	1
Better.	1
Did	1
I	1
say	1
Better?	1
Bru.	1
If	1
you	1
did,	1
I	1
care	1
not	1
Cass.	1
When	1
Caesar	1
liu'd,	1
he	1
durst	1
not	1
thus	1
haue	1
mou'd	1
me	1
Brut.	1
Peace,	1
peace,	1
you	1
durst	1
not	1
so	1
haue	1
tempted	1
him	1
Cassi.	1
I	1
durst	1
not	1
Bru.	1
No	1
Cassi.	1
What?	1
durst	1
not	1
tempt	1
him?	1
Bru.	1
For	1
your	1
life	1
you	1
durst	1
not	1
Cassi.	1
Do	1
not	1
presume	1
too	1
much	1
vpon	1
my	1
Loue,	1
I	1
may	1
do	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
sorry	1
for	1
Bru.	1
You	1
haue	1
done	1
that	1
you	1
should	1
be	1
sorry	1
for.	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
terror	1
Cassius	1
in	1
your	1
threats:	1
For	1
I	1
am	1
Arm'd	1
so	1
strong	1
in	1
Honesty,	1
That	1
they	1
passe	1
by	1
me,	1
as	1
the	1
idle	1
winde,	1
Which	1
I	1
respect	1
not.	1
I	1
did	1
send	1
to	1
you	1
For	1
certaine	1
summes	1
of	1
Gold,	1
which	1
you	1
deny'd	1
me,	1
For	1
I	1
can	1
raise	1
no	1
money	1
by	1
vile	1
meanes:	1
By	1
Heauen,	1
I	1
had	1
rather	1
Coine	1
my	1
Heart,	1
And	1
drop	1
my	1
blood	1
for	1
Drachmaes,	1
then	1
to	1
wring	1
From	1
the	1
hard	1
hands	1
of	1
Peazants,	1
their	1
vile	1
trash	1
By	1
any	1
indirection.	1
I	1
did	1
send	1
To	1
you	1
for	1
Gold	1
to	1
pay	1
my	1
Legions,	1
Which	1
you	1
deny'd	1
me:	1
was	1
that	1
done	1
like	1
Cassius?	1
Should	1
I	1
haue	1
answer'd	1
Caius	1
Cassius	1
so?	1
When	1
Marcus	1
Brutus	1
growes	1
so	1
Couetous,	1
To	1
locke	1
such	1
Rascall	1
Counters	1
from	1
his	1
Friends,	1
Be	1
ready	1
Gods	1
with	1
all	1
your	1
Thunder-bolts,	1
Dash	1
him	1
to	1
peeces	1
Cassi.	1
I	1
deny'd	1
you	1
not	1
Bru.	1
You	1
did	1
Cassi.	1
I	1
did	1
not.	1
He	1
was	1
but	1
a	1
Foole	1
That	1
brought	1
my	1
answer	1
back.	1
Brutus	1
hath	1
riu'd	1
my	1
hart:	1
A	1
Friend	1
should	1
beare	1
his	1
Friends	1
infirmities;	1
But	1
Brutus	1
makes	1
mine	1
greater	1
then	1
they	1
are	1
Bru.	1
I	1
do	1
not,	1
till	1
you	1
practice	1
them	1
on	1
me	1
Cassi.	1
You	1
loue	1
me	1
not	1
Bru.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
like	1
your	1
faults	1
Cassi.	1
A	1
friendly	1
eye	1
could	1
neuer	1
see	1
such	1
faults	1
Bru.	1
A	1
Flatterers	1
would	1
not,	1
though	1
they	1
do	1
appeare	1
As	1
huge	1
as	1
high	1
Olympus	1
Cassi.	1
Come	1
Antony,	1
and	1
yong	1
Octauius	1
come,	1
Reuenge	1
your	1
selues	1
alone	1
on	1
Cassius,	1
For	1
Cassius	1
is	1
a-weary	1
of	1
the	1
World:	1
Hated	1
by	1
one	1
he	1
loues,	1
brau'd	1
by	1
his	1
Brother,	1
Check'd	1
like	1
a	1
bondman,	1
all	1
his	1
faults	1
obseru'd,	1
Set	1
in	1
a	1
Note-booke,	1
learn'd,	1
and	1
con'd	1
by	1
roate	1
To	1
cast	1
into	1
my	1
Teeth.	1
O	1
I	1
could	1
weepe	1
My	1
Spirit	1
from	1
mine	1
eyes.	1
There	1
is	1
my	1
Dagger,	1
And	1
heere	1
my	1
naked	1
Breast:	1
Within,	1
a	1
Heart	1
Deerer	1
then	1
Pluto's	1
Mine,	1
Richer	1
then	1
Gold:	1
If	1
that	1
thou	1
bee'st	1
a	1
Roman,	1
take	1
it	1
foorth.	1
I	1
that	1
deny'd	1
thee	1
Gold,	1
will	1
giue	1
my	1
Heart:	1
Strike	1
as	1
thou	1
did'st	1
at	1
Caesar:	1
For	1
I	1
know,	1
When	1
thou	1
did'st	1
hate	1
him	1
worst,	1
y	1
loued'st	1
him	1
better	1
Then	1
euer	1
thou	1
loued'st	1
Cassius	1
Bru.	1
Sheath	1
your	1
Dagger:	1
Be	1
angry	1
when	1
you	1
will,	1
it	1
shall	1
haue	1
scope:	1
Do	1
what	1
you	1
will,	1
Dishonor,	1
shall	1
be	1
Humour.	1
O	1
Cassius,	1
you	1
are	1
yoaked	1
with	1
a	1
Lambe	1
That	1
carries	1
Anger,	1
as	1
the	1
Flint	1
beares	1

Who	1
much	1
inforced,	1
shewes	1
a	1
hastie	1
Sparke,	1
And	1

Hath	1
Cassius	1
liu'd	1
To	1
be	1

Mirth	1
and	1
Laughter	1
to	1
his	1
Brutus,	1
When	1
greefe	1

temper'd,	1
vexeth	1
him?	1
Bru.	1
When	1
I	1
spoke	1
that,	1
I	1
was	1
ill	1
temper'd	1
too	1
Cassi.	1
Do	1

Giue	1

And	1

O	1

Haue	1

Cassi.	1
This	1
it	1
is:	1
'Tis	1
better	1
that	1
the	1
Enemie	1
seeke	1
vs,	1
So	1
shall	1
he	1
waste	1
his	1
meanes,	1
weary	1
his	1
Souldiers,	1
Doing	1
himselfe	1
offence,	1
whil'st	1
we	1
lying	1
still,	1
Are	1
full	1
of	1
rest,	1
defence,	1
and	1
nimblenesse	1
Bru.	1
Good	1
reasons	1
must	1
of	1
force	1
giue	1
place	1
to	1
better:	1
The	1
people	1
'twixt	1
Philippi,	1
and	1
this	1
ground	1
Do	1
stand	1
but	1
in	1
a	1
forc'd	1
affection:	1
For	1
they	1
haue	1
grug'd	1
vs	1
Contribution.	1
The	1
Enemy,	1
marching	1
along	1
by	1
them,	1
By	1
them	1
shall	1
make	1
a	1
fuller	1
number	1
vp,	1
Come	1
on	1
refresht,	1
new	1
added,	1
and	1
encourag'd:	1
From	1
which	1
aduantage	1
shall	1
we	1
cut	1
him	1
off.	1
If	1
at	1
Philippi	1
we	1
do	1
face	1
him	1
there,	1
These	1
people	1
at	1
our	1
backe	1
Cassi.	1
Heare	1
me	1
good	1
Brother	1
Bru.	1
Vnder	1
your	1
pardon.	1
You	1
must	1
note	1
beside,	1
That	1
we	1
haue	1
tride	1
the	1
vtmost	1
of	1
our	1
Friends:	1
Our	1
Legions	1
are	1
brim	1
full,	1
our	1
cause	1
is	1
ripe,	1
The	1
Enemy	1
encreaseth	1
euery	1
day,	1
We	1
at	1
the	1
height,	1
are	1
readie	1
to	1
decline.	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
Tide	1
in	1
the	1
affayres	1
of	1
men,	1
Which	1
taken	1
at	1
the	1
Flood,	1
leades	1
on	1
to	1
Fortune:	1
Omitted,	1
all	1
the	1
voyage	1
of	1
their	1
life,	1
Is	1
bound	1
in	1
Shallowes,	1
and	1
in	1
Miseries.	1
On	1
such	1
a	1
full	1
Sea	1
are	1
we	1
now	1
a-float,	1
And	1
we	1
must	1
take	1
the	1
current	1
when	1
it	1
serues,	1
Or	1
loose	1
our	1
Ventures	1
Cassi.	1
Then	1
with	1
your	1

go	1
on:	1
wee'l	1
along	1
Our	1
selues,	1
and	1
meet	1

The	1
deepe	1

night	1
is	1
crept	1
vpon	1
our	1

And	1
Nature	1
must	1
obey	1
Necessitie,	1
Which	1
we	1

niggard	1

a	1
little	1

There	1

No	1

Early	1

You	1

But	1
keepe	1
the	1
Hilles	1

They	1

Tut	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
their	1

Wherefore	1
they	1

They	1
could	1
be	1
content	1
To	1
visit	1
other	1
places,	1
and	1
come	1
downe	1
With	1
fearefull	1
brauery:	1
thinking	1
by	1
this	1
face	1
To	1
fasten	1
in	1
our	1
thoughts	1
that	1
they	1
haue	1
Courage;	1
But	1

Prepare	1

The	1

And	1

No	1

Make	1

Countrymen?	1
Octa.	1
Not	1
that	1
we	1
loue	1

better,	1
as	1
you	1

Bru.	1
Good	1

are	1

In	1

Antony,	1
The	1

But	1

rob	1
the	1
Hibla	1
Bees,	1
And	1
leaue	1

Hony-lesse	1
Ant.	1
Not	1
stinglesse	1

O	1

For	1
you	1
haue	1
stolne	1
their	1

Antony,	1
And	1
very	1
wisely	1
threat	1
before	1

Ant.	1
Villains:	1

Apes,	1
And	1

Hounds,	1
And	1

O	1

Flatterers?	1
Now	1
Brutus	1
thanke	1
your	1

This	1

had	1
not	1

so	1
to	1

If	1

Come,	1

If	1

The	1
proofe	1
of	1

will	1
turne	1

Looke,	1
I	1
draw	1
a	1
Sword	1
against	1
Conspirators,	1
When	1
thinke	1
you	1
that	1
the	1

Be	1

Traitors	1
hands.	1
Vnlesse	1
thou	1
bring'st	1
them	1

Octa.	1
So	1
I	1
hope:	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
borne	1
to	1

on	1

O	1

A	1

If	1

Exit	1

Why	1

My	1
Lord	1
Cassi.	1
Messala	1
Messa.	1
What	1
sayes	1
my	1
Generall?	1
Cassi.	1
Messala,	1
this	1
is	1
my	1
Birth-day:	1
at	1
this	1
very	1
day	1
Was	1
Cassius	1
borne.	1
Giue	1
me	1
thy	1
hand	1
Messala:	1
Be	1
thou	1
my	1
witnesse,	1
that	1
against	1
my	1
will	1
(As	1
Pompey	1
was)	1
am	1
I	1
compell'd	1
to	1
set	1
Vpon	1
one	1
Battell	1
all	1
our	1
Liberties.	1
You	1
know,	1
that	1
I	1
held	1
Epicurus	1
strong,	1
And	1
his	1
Opinion:	1
Now	1
I	1
change	1
my	1
minde,	1
And	1
partly	1
credit	1
things	1
that	1
do	1
presage.	1
Comming	1
from	1
Sardis,	1
on	1
our	1
former	1
Ensigne	1
Two	1
mighty	1
Eagles	1
fell,	1
and	1
there	1
they	1
pearch'd,	1
Gorging	1
and	1
feeding	1
from	1
our	1
Soldiers	1
hands,	1
Who	1
to	1
Philippi	1
heere	1
consorted	1
vs:	1
This	1
Morning	1
are	1
they	1
fled	1
away,	1
and	1
gone,	1
And	1
in	1
their	1
steeds,	1
do	1
Rauens,	1
Crowes,	1
and	1
Kites	1
Fly	1
ore	1
our	1
heads,	1
and	1
downward	1
looke	1
on	1
vs	1
As	1
we	1
were	1
sickely	1
prey;	1
their	1
shadowes	1
seeme	1
A	1
Canopy	1
most	1
fatall,	1
vnder	1
which	1
Our	1
Army	1
lies,	1
ready	1
to	1
giue	1
vp	1
the	1
Ghost	1
Messa.	1
Beleeue	1
not	1
so	1
Cassi.	1
I	1
but	1
beleeue	1
it	1
partly,	1
For	1
I	1
am	1
fresh	1
of	1
spirit,	1
and	1
resolu'd	1
To	1
meete	1
all	1
perils,	1
very	1
constantly	1
Bru.	1
Euen	1
so	1
Lucillius	1
Cassi.	1
Now	1
most	1
Noble	1
Brutus,	1
The	1
Gods	1
to	1
day	1
stand	1
friendly,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
Louers	1
in	1
peace,	1
leade	1
on	1
our	1
dayes	1
to	1
age.	1
But	1
since	1
the	1
affayres	1
of	1
men	1
rests	1
still	1
incertaine,	1
Let's	1
reason	1
with	1
the	1
worst	1
that	1
may	1
befall.	1
If	1
we	1
do	1
lose	1
this	1
Battaile,	1
then	1
is	1
this	1
The	1
very	1
last	1
time	1
we	1
shall	1
speake	1
together:	1
What	1
are	1
you	1
then	1
determined	1
to	1
do?	1
Bru.	1
Euen	1
by	1
the	1
rule	1
of	1
that	1
Philosophy,	1
By	1
which	1
I	1
did	1
blame	1
Cato,	1
for	1
the	1
death	1
Which	1
he	1
did	1
giue	1
himselfe,	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
how:	1
But	1
I	1
do	1
finde	1
it	1
Cowardly,	1
and	1
vile,	1
For	1
feare	1
of	1
what	1
might	1
fall,	1
so	1
to	1
preuent	1
The	1
time	1
of	1
life,	1
arming	1
my	1
selfe	1
with	1
patience,	1
To	1
stay	1
the	1
prouidence	1
of	1
some	1
high	1
Powers,	1
That	1
gouerne	1
vs	1
below	1
Cassi.	1
Then,	1
if	1
we	1
loose	1
this	1
Battaile,	1
You	1
are	1
contented	1
to	1
be	1
led	1
in	1
Triumph	1
Thorow	1
the	1
streets	1
of	1
Rome	1
Bru.	1
No	1
Cassius,	1
no:	1
Thinke	1
not	1
thou	1
Noble	1
Romane,	1
That	1
euer	1
Brutus	1
will	1
go	1
bound	1
to	1
Rome,	1
He	1
beares	1
too	1
great	1
a	1
minde.	1
But	1
this	1
same	1
day	1
Must	1
end	1
that	1
worke,	1
the	1
Ides	1
of	1
March	1
begun.	1
And	1
whether	1
we	1
shall	1
meete	1
againe,	1
I	1
know	1
not:	1
Therefore	1
our	1
euerlasting	1
farewell	1
take:	1
For	1
euer,	1
and	1
for	1
euer,	1
farewell	1
Cassius,	1
If	1
we	1
do	1
meete	1
againe,	1
why	1
we	1
shall	1
smile;	1
If	1
not,	1
why	1
then	1
this	1
parting	1
was	1
well	1
made	1
Cassi.	1
For	1
euer,	1
and	1
for	1
euer,	1
farewell	1
Brutus:	1
If	1
we	1
do	1
meete	1
againe,	1
wee'l	1
smile	1
indeede;	1
If	1
not,	1
'tis	1
true,	1
this	1
parting	1
was	1
well	1
made	1
Bru.	1
Why	1
then	1
leade	1
on.	1
O	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
might	1
know	1
The	1
end	1
of	1
this	1
dayes	1
businesse,	1
ere	1
it	1
come:	1
But	1
it	1
sufficeth,	1
that	1
the	1
day	1
will	1
end,	1
And	1
then	1
the	1
end	1
is	1
knowne.	1
Come	1

To	1

Enter	1

Come	1

In	1

Prisoner,	1
And	1
then	1
I	1
swore	1

sauing	1

That	1
whatsoeuer	1
I	1

Thou	1

Come	1

Now	1

That	1

Stand	1

And	1

So,	1

Yet	1

Durst	1

O	1

Farre	1
from	1
this	1
Country	1
Pindarus	1

Where	1
neuer	1

Enter	1

Is	1

Noble	1
Brutus	1

As	1

These	1

All	1

With	1

Is	1

O	1

No,	1

But	1

O	1

Sunne:	1
As	1

sinke	1

So	1
in	1

Cassius	1
day	1
is	1
set.	1
The	1
Sunne	1

Our	1

Clowds,	1
Dewes,	1

Dangers	1

Mistrust	1

Mistrust	1
of	1

O	1

The	1

Seeke	1

The	1
Noble	1
Brutus,	1
thrusting	1
this	1
report	1
Into	1
his	1

I	1
may	1
say	1
thrusting	1
it:	1
For	1
piercing	1
Steele,	1

Darts	1
inuenomed,	1
Shall	1

Hye	1

And	1
I	1

Why	1
did'st	1
thou	1
send	1
me	1
forth	1
braue	1
Cassius?	1
Did	1
I	1
not	1
meet	1

Friends,	1
and	1
did	1

Put	1

my	1
Browes	1
this	1

And	1
bid	1
me	1

Did'st	1
thou	1

heare	1
their	1

Alas,	1
thou	1
hast	1
misconstrued	1
euery	1

But	1

take	1
this	1
Garland	1

Thy	1

Will	1
