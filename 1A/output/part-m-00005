CHAPTER	1
1	1
The	1
family	1
of	1
Dashwood	1
had	1
long	1
been	1
settled	1
in	1
Sussex.	1
Their	1
estate	1
was	1
large,	1
and	1
their	1
residence	1
was	1
at	1
Norland	1
Park,	1
in	1
the	1
centre	1
of	1
their	1
property,	1
where,	1
for	1
many	1
generations,	1
they	1
had	1
lived	1
in	1
so	1
respectable	1
a	1
manner	1
as	1
to	1
engage	1
the	1
general	1
good	1
opinion	1
of	1
their	1
surrounding	1
acquaintance.	1
The	1
late	1
owner	1
of	1
this	1
estate	1
was	1
a	1
single	1
man,	1
who	1
lived	1
to	1
a	1
very	1
advanced	1
age,	1
and	1
who	1
for	1
many	1
years	1
of	1
his	1
life,	1
had	1
a	1
constant	1
companion	1
and	1
housekeeper	1
in	1
his	1
sister.	1
But	1
her	1
death,	1
which	1
happened	1
ten	1
years	1
before	1
his	1
own,	1
produced	1
a	1
great	1
alteration	1
in	1
his	1
home;	1
for	1
to	1
supply	1
her	1
loss,	1
he	1
invited	1
and	1
received	1
into	1
his	1
house	1
the	1
family	1
of	1
his	1
nephew	1
Mr.	1
Henry	1
Dashwood,	1
the	1
legal	1
inheritor	1
of	1
the	1
Norland	1
estate,	1
and	1
the	1
person	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
intended	1
to	1
bequeath	1
it.	1
In	1
the	1
society	1
of	1
his	1
nephew	1
and	1
niece,	1
and	1
their	1
children,	1
the	1
old	1
Gentleman's	1
days	1
were	1
comfortably	1
spent.	1
His	1
attachment	1
to	1
them	1
all	1
increased.	1
The	1
constant	1
attention	1
of	1
Mr.	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Henry	1
Dashwood	1
to	1
his	1
wishes,	1
which	1
proceeded	1
not	1
merely	1
from	1
interest,	1
but	1
from	1
goodness	1
of	1
heart,	1
gave	1
him	1
every	1
degree	1
of	1
solid	1
comfort	1
which	1
his	1
age	1
could	1
receive;	1
and	1
the	1
cheerfulness	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
added	1
a	1
relish	1
to	1
his	1
existence.	1
By	1
a	1
former	1
marriage,	1
Mr.	1
Henry	1
Dashwood	1
had	1
one	1
son:	1
by	1
his	1
present	1
lady,	1
three	1
daughters.	1
The	1
son,	1
a	1
steady	1
respectable	1
young	1
man,	1
was	1
amply	1
provided	1
for	1
by	1
the	1
fortune	1
of	1
his	1
mother,	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
large,	1
and	1
half	1
of	1
which	1
devolved	1
on	1
him	1
on	1
his	1
coming	1
of	1
age.	1
By	1
his	1
own	1
marriage,	1
likewise,	1
which	1
happened	1
soon	1
afterwards,	1
he	1
added	1
to	1
his	1
wealth.	1
To	1
him	1
therefore	1
the	1
succession	1
to	1
the	1
Norland	1
estate	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
really	1
important	1
as	1
to	1
his	1
sisters;	1
for	1
their	1
fortune,	1
independent	1
of	1
what	1
might	1
arise	1
to	1
them	1
from	1
their	1
father's	1
inheriting	1
that	1
property,	1
could	1
be	1
but	1
small.	1
Their	1
mother	1
had	1
nothing,	1
and	1
their	1
father	1
only	1
seven	1
thousand	1
pounds	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
disposal;	1
for	1
the	1
remaining	1
moiety	1
of	1
his	1
first	1
wife's	1
fortune	1
was	1
also	1
secured	1
to	1
her	1
child,	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
only	1
a	1
life-interest	1
in	1
it.	1
The	1
old	1
gentleman	1
died:	1
his	1
will	1
was	1
read,	1
and	1
like	1
almost	1
every	1
other	1
will,	1
gave	1
as	1
much	1
disappointment	1
as	1
pleasure.	1
He	1
was	1
neither	1
so	1
unjust,	1
nor	1
so	1
ungrateful,	1
as	1
to	1
leave	1
his	1
estate	1
from	1
his	1
nephew;--but	1
he	1
left	1
it	1
to	1
him	1
on	1
such	1
terms	1
as	1
destroyed	1
half	1
the	1
value	1
of	1
the	1
bequest.	1
Mr.	1
Dashwood	1
had	1
wished	1
for	1
it	1
more	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
daughters	1
than	1
for	1
himself	1
or	1
his	1
son;--but	1
to	1
his	1
son,	1
and	1
his	1
son's	1
son,	1
a	1
child	1
of	1
four	1
years	1
old,	1
it	1
was	1
secured,	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
way,	1
as	1
to	1
leave	1
to	1
himself	1
no	1
power	1
of	1
providing	1
for	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
most	1
dear	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
who	1
most	1
needed	1
a	1
provision	1
by	1
any	1
charge	1
on	1
the	1
estate,	1
or	1
by	1
any	1
sale	1
of	1
its	1
valuable	1
woods.	1
The	1
whole	1
was	1
tied	1
up	1
for	1
the	1
benefit	1
of	1
this	1
child,	1
who,	1
in	1
occasional	1
visits	1
with	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
mother	1
at	1
Norland,	1
had	1
so	1
far	1
gained	1
on	1
the	1
affections	1
of	1
his	1
uncle,	1
by	1
such	1
attractions	1
as	1
are	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
unusual	1
in	1
children	1
of	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
years	1
old;	1
an	1
imperfect	1
articulation,	1
an	1
earnest	1
desire	1
of	1
having	1
his	1
own	1
way,	1
many	1
cunning	1
tricks,	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
noise,	1
as	1
to	1
outweigh	1
all	1
the	1
value	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
attention	1
which,	1
for	1
years,	1
he	1
had	1
received	1
from	1
his	1
niece	1
and	1
her	1
daughters.	1
He	1
meant	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
unkind,	1
however,	1
and,	1
as	1
a	1
mark	1
of	1
his	1
affection	1
for	1
the	1
three	1
girls,	1
he	1
left	1
them	1
a	1
thousand	1
pounds	1
a-piece.	1
Mr.	1
Dashwood's	1
disappointment	1
was,	1
at	1
first,	1
severe;	1
but	1
his	1
temper	1
was	1
cheerful	1
and	1
sanguine;	1
and	1
he	1
might	1
reasonably	1
hope	1
to	1
live	1
many	1
years,	1
and	1
by	1
living	1
economically,	1
lay	1
by	1
a	1
considerable	1
sum	1
from	1
the	1
produce	1
of	1
an	1
estate	1
already	1
large,	1
and	1
capable	1
of	1
almost	1
immediate	1
improvement.	1
But	1
the	1
fortune,	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
tardy	1
in	1
coming,	1
was	1
his	1
only	1
one	1
twelvemonth.	1
He	1
survived	1
his	1
uncle	1
no	1
longer;	1
and	1
ten	1
thousand	1
pounds,	1
including	1
the	1
late	1
legacies,	1
was	1
all	1
that	1
remained	1
for	1
his	1
widow	1
and	1
daughters.	1
His	1
son	1
was	1
sent	1
for	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
his	1
danger	1
was	1
known,	1
and	1
to	1
him	1
Mr.	1
Dashwood	1
recommended,	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
strength	1
and	1
urgency	1
which	1
illness	1
could	1
command,	1
the	1
interest	1
of	1
his	1
mother-in-law	1
and	1
sisters.	1
Mr.	1
John	1
Dashwood	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
strong	1
feelings	1
of	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
family;	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
affected	1
by	1
a	1
recommendation	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
nature	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
time,	1
and	1
he	1
promised	1
to	1
do	1
every	1
thing	1
in	1
his	1
power	1
to	1
make	1
them	1
comfortable.	1
His	1
father	1
was	1
rendered	1
easy	1
by	1
such	1
an	1
assurance,	1
and	1
Mr.	1
John	1
Dashwood	1
had	1
then	1
leisure	1
to	1
consider	1
how	1
much	1
there	1
might	1
prudently	1
be	1
in	1
his	1
power	1
to	1
do	1
for	1
them.	1
He	1
was	1
not	1
an	1
ill-disposed	1
young	1
man,	1
unless	1
to	1
be	1
rather	1
cold	1
hearted	1
and	1
rather	1
selfish	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
ill-disposed:	1
but	1
he	1
was,	1
in	1
general,	1
well	1
respected;	1
for	1
he	1
conducted	1
himself	1
with	1
propriety	1
in	1
the	1
discharge	1
of	1
his	1
ordinary	1
duties.	1
Had	1
he	1
married	1
a	1
more	1
amiable	1
woman,	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
made	1
still	1
more	1
respectable	1
than	1
he	1
was:--he	1
might	1
even	1
have	1
been	1
made	1
amiable	1
himself;	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
young	1
when	1
he	1
married,	1
and	1
very	1
fond	1
of	1
his	1
wife.	1
But	1
Mrs.	1
John	1
Dashwood	1
was	1
a	1
strong	1
caricature	1
of	1
himself;--	1
more	1
narrow-minded	1
and	1
selfish.	1
When	1
he	1
gave	1
his	1
promise	1
to	1
his	1
father,	1
he	1
meditated	1
within	1
himself	1
to	1
increase	1
the	1
fortunes	1
of	1
his	1
sisters	1
by	1
the	1
present	1
of	1
a	1
thousand	1
pounds	1
a-piece.	1
He	1
then	1
really	1
thought	1
himself	1
equal	1
to	1
it.	1
The	1
prospect	1
of	1
four	1
thousand	1
a-year,	1
in	1
addition	1
to	1
his	1
present	1
income,	1
besides	1
the	1
remaining	1
half	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
mother's	1
fortune,	1
warmed	1
his	1
heart,	1
and	1
made	1
him	1
feel	1
capable	1
of	1
generosity.--	1
"Yes,	1
he	1
would	1
give	1
them	1
three	1
thousand	1
pounds:	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
liberal	1
and	1
handsome!	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
enough	1
to	1
make	1
them	1
completely	1
easy.	1
Three	1
thousand	1
pounds!	1
he	1
could	1
spare	1
so	1
considerable	1
a	1
sum	1
with	1
little	1
inconvenience."--	1
He	1
thought	1
of	1
it	1
all	1
day	1
long,	1
and	1
for	1
many	1
days	1
successively,	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
repent.	1
No	1
sooner	1
was	1
his	1
father's	1
funeral	1
over,	1
than	1
Mrs.	1
John	1
Dashwood,	1
without	1
sending	1
any	1
notice	1
of	1
her	1
intention	1
to	1
her	1
mother-in-law,	1
arrived	1
with	1
her	1
child	1
and	1
their	1
attendants.	1
No	1
one	1
could	1
dispute	1
her	1
right	1
to	1
come;	1
the	1
house	1
was	1
her	1
husband's	1
from	1
the	1
moment	1
of	1
his	1
father's	1
decease;	1
but	1
the	1
indelicacy	1
of	1
her	1
conduct	1
was	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
greater,	1
and	1
to	1
a	1
woman	1
in	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood's	1
situation,	1
with	1
only	1
common	1
feelings,	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
highly	1
unpleasing;--	1
but	1
in	1
HER	1
mind	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
honor	1
so	1
keen,	1
a	1
generosity	1
so	1
romantic,	1
that	1
any	1
offence	1
of	1
the	1
kind,	1
by	1
whomsoever	1
given	1
or	1
received,	1
was	1
to	1
her	1
a	1
source	1
of	1
immoveable	1
disgust.	1
Mrs.	1
John	1
Dashwood	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
a	1
favourite	1
with	1
any	1
of	1
her	1
husband's	1
family;	1
but	1
she	1
had	1
had	1
no	1
opportunity,	1
till	1
the	1
present,	1
of	1
shewing	1
them	1
with	1
how	1
little	1
attention	1
to	1
the	1
comfort	1
of	1
other	1
people	1
she	1
could	1
act	1
when	1
occasion	1
required	1
it.	1
So	1
acutely	1
did	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood	1
feel	1
this	1
ungracious	1
behaviour,	1
and	1
so	1
earnestly	1
did	1
she	1
despise	1
her	1
daughter-in-law	1
for	1
it,	1
that,	1
on	1
the	1
arrival	1
of	1
the	1
latter,	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
quitted	1
the	1
house	1
for	1
ever,	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
entreaty	1
of	1
her	1
eldest	1
girl	1
induced	1
her	1
first	1
to	1
reflect	1
on	1
the	1
propriety	1
of	1
going,	1
and	1
her	1
own	1
tender	1
love	1
for	1
all	1
her	1
three	1
children	1
determined	1
her	1
afterwards	1
to	1
stay,	1
and	1
for	1
their	1
sakes	1
avoid	1
a	1
breach	1
with	1
their	1
brother.	1
Elinor,	1
this	1
eldest	1
daughter,	1
whose	1
advice	1
was	1
so	1
effectual,	1
possessed	1
a	1
strength	1
of	1
understanding,	1
and	1
coolness	1
of	1
judgment,	1
which	1
qualified	1
her,	1
though	1
only	1
nineteen,	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
counsellor	1
of	1
her	1
mother,	1
and	1
enabled	1
her	1
frequently	1
to	1
counteract,	1
to	1
the	1
advantage	1
of	1
them	1
all,	1
that	1
eagerness	1
of	1
mind	1
in	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood	1
which	1
must	1
generally	1
have	1
led	1
to	1
imprudence.	1
She	1
had	1
an	1
excellent	1
heart;--her	1
disposition	1
was	1
affectionate,	1
and	1
her	1
feelings	1
were	1
strong;	1
but	1
she	1
knew	1
how	1
to	1
govern	1
them:	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
knowledge	1
which	1
her	1
mother	1
had	1
yet	1
to	1
learn;	1
and	1
which	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
sisters	1
had	1
resolved	1
never	1
to	1
be	1
taught.	1
Marianne's	1
abilities	1
were,	1
in	1
many	1
respects,	1
quite	1
equal	1
to	1
Elinor's.	1
She	1
was	1
sensible	1
and	1
clever;	1
but	1
eager	1
in	1
everything:	1
her	1
sorrows,	1
her	1
joys,	1
could	1
have	1
no	1
moderation.	1
She	1
was	1
generous,	1
amiable,	1
interesting:	1
she	1
was	1
everything	1
but	1
prudent.	1
The	1
resemblance	1
between	1
her	1
and	1
her	1
mother	1
was	1
strikingly	1
great.	1
Elinor	1
saw,	1
with	1
concern,	1
the	1
excess	1
of	1
her	1
sister's	1
sensibility;	1
but	1
by	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood	1
it	1
was	1
valued	1
and	1
cherished.	1
They	1
encouraged	1
each	1
other	1
now	1
in	1
the	1
violence	1
of	1
their	1
affliction.	1
The	1
agony	1
of	1
grief	1
which	1
overpowered	1
them	1
at	1
first,	1
was	1
voluntarily	1
renewed,	1
was	1
sought	1
for,	1
was	1
created	1
again	1
and	1
again.	1
They	1
gave	1
themselves	1
up	1
wholly	1
to	1
their	1
sorrow,	1
seeking	1
increase	1
of	1
wretchedness	1
in	1
every	1
reflection	1
that	1
could	1
afford	1
it,	1
and	1
resolved	1
against	1
ever	1
admitting	1
consolation	1
in	1
future.	1
Elinor,	1
too,	1
was	1
deeply	1
afflicted;	1
but	1
still	1
she	1
could	1
struggle,	1
she	1
could	1
exert	1
herself.	1
She	1
could	1
consult	1
with	1
her	1
brother,	1
could	1
receive	1
her	1
sister-in-law	1
on	1
her	1
arrival,	1
and	1
treat	1
her	1
with	1
proper	1
attention;	1
and	1
could	1
strive	1
to	1
rouse	1
her	1
mother	1
to	1
similar	1
exertion,	1
and	1
encourage	1
her	1
to	1
similar	1
forbearance.	1
Margaret,	1
the	1
other	1
sister,	1
was	1
a	1
good-humored,	1
well-disposed	1
girl;	1
but	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
already	1
imbibed	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
of	1
Marianne's	1
romance,	1
without	1
having	1
much	1
of	1
her	1
sense,	1
she	1
did	1
not,	1
at	1
thirteen,	1
bid	1
fair	1
to	1
equal	1
her	1
sisters	1
at	1
a	1
more	1
advanced	1
period	1
of	1
life.	1

now	1
installed	1
herself	1
mistress	1
of	1
Norland;	1
and	1
her	1
mother	1
and	1
sisters-in-law	1
were	1
degraded	1
to	1
the	1
condition	1
of	1
visitors.	1
As	1
such,	1
however,	1
they	1
were	1
treated	1
by	1
her	1
with	1
quiet	1
civility;	1
and	1
by	1
her	1
husband	1
with	1
as	1
much	1
kindness	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
feel	1
towards	1
anybody	1
beyond	1
himself,	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
their	1
child.	1
He	1
really	1
pressed	1
them,	1
with	1
some	1
earnestness,	1
to	1
consider	1
Norland	1
as	1
their	1
home;	1
and,	1
as	1
no	1
plan	1
appeared	1
so	1
eligible	1
to	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood	1
as	1
remaining	1
there	1
till	1
she	1
could	1
accommodate	1
herself	1
with	1
a	1
house	1
in	1
the	1
neighbourhood,	1
his	1
invitation	1
was	1
accepted.	1
A	1
continuance	1
in	1
a	1
place	1
where	1
everything	1
reminded	1
her	1
of	1
former	1
delight,	1
was	1
exactly	1
what	1
suited	1
her	1
mind.	1
In	1
seasons	1
of	1
cheerfulness,	1
no	1
temper	1
could	1
be	1
more	1
cheerful	1
than	1
hers,	1
or	1
possess,	1
in	1
a	1
greater	1
degree,	1
that	1
sanguine	1
expectation	1
of	1
happiness	1
which	1
is	1
happiness	1
itself.	1
But	1
in	1
sorrow	1
she	1
must	1
be	1
equally	1
carried	1
away	1
by	1
her	1
fancy,	1
and	1
as	1
far	1
beyond	1
consolation	1
as	1
in	1
pleasure	1
she	1
was	1
beyond	1
alloy.	1
Mrs.	1
John	1
Dashwood	1
did	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
approve	1
of	1
what	1
her	1
husband	1
intended	1
to	1
do	1
for	1
his	1
sisters.	1
To	1
take	1
three	1
thousand	1
pounds	1
from	1
the	1
fortune	1
of	1
their	1
dear	1
little	1
boy	1
would	1
be	1
impoverishing	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
most	1
dreadful	1
degree.	1
She	1
begged	1
him	1
to	1
think	1
again	1
on	1
the	1
subject.	1
How	1
could	1
he	1
answer	1
it	1
to	1
himself	1
to	1
rob	1
his	1
child,	1
and	1
his	1
only	1
child	1
too,	1
of	1
so	1
large	1
a	1
sum?	1
And	1
what	1
possible	1
claim	1
could	1
the	1
Miss	1
Dashwoods,	1
who	1
were	1
related	1
to	1
him	1
only	1
by	1
half	1
blood,	1
which	1
she	1
considered	1
as	1
no	1
relationship	1
at	1
all,	1
have	1
on	1
his	1
generosity	1
to	1
so	1
large	1
an	1
amount.	1
It	1
was	1
very	1
well	1
known	1
that	1
no	1
affection	1
was	1
ever	1
supposed	1
to	1
exist	1
between	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
any	1
man	1
by	1
different	1
marriages;	1
and	1
why	1
was	1
he	1
to	1
ruin	1
himself,	1
and	1
their	1
poor	1
little	1
Harry,	1
by	1
giving	1
away	1
all	1
his	1
money	1
to	1
his	1
half	1
sisters?	1
"It	1
was	1
my	1
father's	1
last	1
request	1
to	1
me,"	1
replied	1
her	1
husband,	1
"that	1
I	1
should	1
assist	1
his	1
widow	1
and	1
daughters."	1
"He	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
talking	1
of,	1
I	1
dare	1
say;	1
ten	1
to	1
one	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
light-headed	1
at	1
the	1
time.	1
Had	1
he	1
been	1
in	1
his	1
right	1
senses,	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
thought	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
thing	1
as	1
begging	1
you	1
to	1
give	1
away	1
half	1
your	1
fortune	1
from	1
your	1
own	1
child."	1
"He	1
did	1
not	1
stipulate	1
for	1
any	1
particular	1
sum,	1
my	1
dear	1
Fanny;	1
he	1
only	1
requested	1
me,	1
in	1
general	1
terms,	1
to	1
assist	1
them,	1
and	1
make	1
their	1
situation	1
more	1
comfortable	1
than	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
power	1
to	1
do.	1
Perhaps	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
as	1
well	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
it	1
wholly	1
to	1
myself.	1
He	1
could	1
hardly	1
suppose	1
I	1
should	1
neglect	1
them.	1
But	1
as	1
he	1
required	1
the	1
promise,	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
do	1
less	1
than	1
give	1
it;	1
at	1
least	1
I	1
thought	1
so	1
at	1
the	1
time.	1
The	1
promise,	1
therefore,	1
was	1
given,	1
and	1
must	1
be	1
performed.	1
Something	1
must	1
be	1
done	1
for	1
them	1
whenever	1
they	1
leave	1
Norland	1
and	1
settle	1
in	1
a	1
new	1
home."	1
"Well,	1
then,	1
LET	1
something	1
be	1
done	1
for	1
them;	1
but	1
THAT	1
something	1
need	1
not	1
be	1
three	1
thousand	1
pounds.	1
Consider,"	1
she	1
added,	1
"that	1
when	1
the	1
money	1
is	1
once	1
parted	1
with,	1
it	1
never	1
can	1
return.	1
Your	1
sisters	1
will	1
marry,	1
and	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
gone	1
for	1
ever.	1
If,	1
indeed,	1
it	1
could	1
be	1
restored	1
to	1
our	1
poor	1
little	1
boy--"	1
"Why,	1
to	1
be	1
sure,"	1
said	1
her	1
husband,	1
very	1
gravely,	1
"that	1
would	1
make	1
great	1
difference.	1
The	1
time	1
may	1
come	1
when	1
Harry	1
will	1
regret	1
that	1
so	1
large	1
a	1
sum	1
was	1
parted	1
with.	1
If	1
he	1
should	1
have	1
a	1
numerous	1
family,	1
for	1
instance,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
very	1
convenient	1
addition."	1
"To	1
be	1
sure	1
it	1
would."	1
"Perhaps,	1
then,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
better	1
for	1
all	1
parties,	1
if	1
the	1
sum	1
were	1
diminished	1
one	1
half.--Five	1
hundred	1
pounds	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
prodigious	1
increase	1
to	1
their	1
fortunes!"	1
"Oh!	1
beyond	1
anything	1
great!	1
What	1
brother	1
on	1
earth	1
would	1
do	1
half	1
so	1
much	1
for	1
his	1
sisters,	1
even	1
if	1
REALLY	1
his	1
sisters!	1
And	1
as	1
it	1
is--only	1
half	1
blood!--But	1
you	1
have	1
such	1
a	1
generous	1
spirit!"	1
"I	1
would	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
do	1
any	1
thing	1
mean,"	1
he	1
replied.	1
"One	1
had	1
rather,	1
on	1
such	1
occasions,	1
do	1
too	1
much	1
than	1
too	1
little.	1
No	1
one,	1
at	1
least,	1
can	1
think	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
done	1
enough	1
for	1
them:	1
even	1
themselves,	1
they	1
can	1
hardly	1
expect	1
more."	1
"There	1
is	1
no	1
knowing	1
what	1
THEY	1
may	1
expect,"	1
said	1
the	1
lady,	1
"but	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
their	1
expectations:	1
the	1
question	1
is,	1
what	1
you	1
can	1
afford	1
to	1
do."	1
"Certainly--and	1
I	1
think	1
I	1
may	1
afford	1
to	1
give	1
them	1
five	1
hundred	1
pounds	1
a-piece.	1
As	1
it	1
is,	1
without	1
any	1
addition	1
of	1
mine,	1
they	1
will	1
each	1
have	1
about	1
three	1
thousand	1
pounds	1
on	1
their	1
mother's	1
death--a	1
very	1
comfortable	1
fortune	1
for	1
any	1
young	1
woman."	1
"To	1
be	1
sure	1
it	1
is;	1
and,	1
indeed,	1
it	1
strikes	1
me	1
that	1
they	1
can	1
want	1
no	1
addition	1
at	1
all.	1
They	1
will	1
have	1
ten	1
thousand	1
pounds	1
divided	1
amongst	1
them.	1
If	1
they	1
marry,	1
they	1
will	1
be	1
sure	1
of	1
doing	1
well,	1
and	1
if	1
they	1
do	1
not,	1
they	1
may	1
all	1
live	1
very	1
comfortably	1
together	1
on	1
the	1
interest	1
of	1
ten	1
thousand	1
pounds."	1
"That	1
is	1
very	1
true,	1
and,	1
therefore,	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
whether,	1
upon	1
the	1
whole,	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
more	1
advisable	1
to	1
do	1
something	1
for	1
their	1
mother	1
while	1
she	1
lives,	1
rather	1
than	1
for	1
them--something	1
of	1
the	1
annuity	1
kind	1
I	1
mean.--My	1
sisters	1
would	1
feel	1
the	1
good	1
effects	1
of	1
it	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
herself.	1
A	1
hundred	1
a	1
year	1
would	1
make	1
them	1
all	1
perfectly	1
comfortable."	1
His	1
wife	1
hesitated	1
a	1
little,	1
however,	1
in	1
giving	1
her	1
consent	1
to	1
this	1
plan.	1
"To	1
be	1
sure,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"it	1
is	1
better	1
than	1
parting	1
with	1
fifteen	1
hundred	1
pounds	1
at	1
once.	1
But,	1
then,	1
if	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood	1
should	1
live	1
fifteen	1
years	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
completely	1
taken	1
in."	1
"Fifteen	1
years!	1
my	1
dear	1
Fanny;	1
her	1
life	1
cannot	1
be	1
worth	1
half	1
that	1
purchase."	1
"Certainly	1
not;	1
but	1
if	1
you	1
observe,	1
people	1
always	1
live	1
for	1
ever	1
when	1
there	1
is	1
an	1
annuity	1
to	1
be	1
paid	1
them;	1
and	1
she	1
is	1
very	1
stout	1
and	1
healthy,	1
and	1
hardly	1
forty.	1
An	1
annuity	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
serious	1
business;	1
it	1
comes	1
over	1
and	1
over	1
every	1
year,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
getting	1
rid	1
of	1
it.	1
You	1
are	1
not	1
aware	1
of	1
what	1
you	1
are	1
doing.	1
I	1
have	1
known	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
the	1
trouble	1
of	1
annuities;	1
for	1
my	1
mother	1
was	1
clogged	1
with	1
the	1
payment	1
of	1
three	1
to	1
old	1
superannuated	1
servants	1
by	1
my	1
father's	1
will,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
amazing	1
how	1
disagreeable	1
she	1
found	1
it.	1
Twice	1
every	1
year	1
these	1
annuities	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
paid;	1
and	1
then	1
there	1
was	1
the	1
trouble	1
of	1
getting	1
it	1
to	1
them;	1
and	1
then	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
was	1
said	1
to	1
have	1
died,	1
and	1
afterwards	1
it	1
turned	1
out	1
to	1
be	1
no	1
such	1
thing.	1
My	1
mother	1
was	1
quite	1
sick	1
of	1
it.	1
Her	1
income	1
was	1
not	1
her	1
own,	1
she	1
said,	1
with	1
such	1
perpetual	1
claims	1
on	1
it;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
more	1
unkind	1
in	1
my	1
father,	1
because,	1
otherwise,	1
the	1
money	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
entirely	1
at	1
my	1
mother's	1
disposal,	1
without	1
any	1
restriction	1
whatever.	1
It	1
has	1
given	1
me	1
such	1
an	1
abhorrence	1
of	1
annuities,	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
pin	1
myself	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
payment	1
of	1
one	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
world."	1
"It	1
is	1
certainly	1
an	1
unpleasant	1
thing,"	1
replied	1
Mr.	1
Dashwood,	1
"to	1
have	1
those	1
kind	1
of	1
yearly	1
drains	1
on	1
one's	1
income.	1
One's	1
fortune,	1
as	1
your	1
mother	1
justly	1
says,	1
is	1
NOT	1
one's	1
own.	1
To	1
be	1
tied	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
regular	1
payment	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
sum,	1
on	1
every	1
rent	1
day,	1
is	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
desirable:	1
it	1
takes	1
away	1
one's	1
independence."	1
"Undoubtedly;	1
and	1
after	1
all	1
you	1
have	1
no	1
thanks	1
for	1
it.	1
They	1
think	1
themselves	1
secure,	1
you	1
do	1
no	1
more	1
than	1
what	1
is	1
expected,	1
and	1
it	1
raises	1
no	1
gratitude	1
at	1
all.	1
If	1
I	1
were	1
you,	1
whatever	1
I	1
did	1
should	1
be	1
done	1
at	1
my	1
own	1
discretion	1
entirely.	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
bind	1
myself	1
to	1
allow	1
them	1
any	1
thing	1
yearly.	1
It	1
may	1
be	1
very	1
inconvenient	1
some	1
years	1
to	1
spare	1
a	1
hundred,	1
or	1
even	1
fifty	1
pounds	1
from	1
our	1
own	1
expenses."	1
"I	1
believe	1
you	1
are	1
right,	1
my	1
love;	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
better	1
that	1
there	1
should	1
by	1
no	1
annuity	1
in	1
the	1
case;	1
whatever	1
I	1
may	1
give	1
them	1
occasionally	1
will	1
be	1
of	1
far	1
greater	1
assistance	1
than	1
a	1
yearly	1
allowance,	1
because	1
they	1
would	1
only	1
enlarge	1
their	1
style	1
of	1
living	1
if	1
they	1
felt	1
sure	1
of	1
a	1
larger	1
income,	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
sixpence	1
the	1
richer	1
for	1
it	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
year.	1
It	1
will	1
certainly	1
be	1
much	1
the	1
best	1
way.	1
A	1
present	1
of	1
fifty	1
pounds,	1
now	1
and	1
then,	1
will	1
prevent	1
their	1
ever	1
being	1
distressed	1
for	1
money,	1
and	1
will,	1
I	1
think,	1
be	1
amply	1
discharging	1
my	1
promise	1
to	1
my	1
father."	1
"To	1
be	1
sure	1
it	1
will.	1
Indeed,	1
to	1
say	1
the	1
truth,	1
I	1
am	1
convinced	1
within	1
myself	1
that	1
your	1
father	1
had	1
no	1
idea	1
of	1
your	1
giving	1
them	1
any	1
money	1
at	1
all.	1
The	1
assistance	1
he	1
thought	1
of,	1
I	1
dare	1
say,	1
was	1
only	1
such	1
as	1
might	1
be	1
reasonably	1
expected	1
of	1
you;	1
for	1
instance,	1
such	1
as	1
looking	1
out	1
for	1
a	1
comfortable	1
small	1
house	1
for	1
them,	1
helping	1
them	1
to	1
move	1
their	1
things,	1
and	1
sending	1
them	1
presents	1
of	1
fish	1
and	1
game,	1
and	1
so	1
forth,	1
whenever	1
they	1
are	1
in	1
season.	1
I'll	1
lay	1
my	1
life	1
that	1
he	1
meant	1
nothing	1
farther;	1
indeed,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
very	1
strange	1
and	1
unreasonable	1
if	1
he	1
did.	1
Do	1
but	1
consider,	1
my	1
dear	1
Mr.	1
Dashwood,	1
how	1
excessively	1
comfortable	1
your	1
mother-in-law	1
and	1
her	1
daughters	1
may	1
live	1
on	1
the	1
interest	1
of	1
seven	1
thousand	1
pounds,	1
besides	1
the	1
thousand	1
pounds	1
belonging	1
to	1
each	1
of	1
the	1
girls,	1
which	1
brings	1
them	1
in	1
fifty	1
pounds	1
a	1
year	1
a-piece,	1
and,	1
of	1
course,	1
they	1
will	1
pay	1
their	1
mother	1
for	1
their	1
board	1
out	1
of	1
it.	1
Altogether,	1
they	1
will	1
have	1
five	1
hundred	1
a-year	1
amongst	1
them,	1
and	1
what	1
on	1
earth	1
can	1
four	1
women	1
want	1
for	1
more	1
than	1
that?--They	1
will	1
live	1
so	1
cheap!	1
Their	1
housekeeping	1
will	1
be	1
nothing	1
at	1
all.	1
They	1
will	1
have	1
no	1
carriage,	1
no	1
horses,	1
and	1
hardly	1
any	1
servants;	1
they	1
will	1
keep	1
no	1
company,	1
and	1
can	1
have	1
no	1
expenses	1
of	1
any	1
kind!	1
Only	1
conceive	1
how	1
comfortable	1
they	1
will	1
be!	1
Five	1
hundred	1
a	1
year!	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
I	1
cannot	1
imagine	1
how	1
they	1
will	1
spend	1
half	1
of	1
it;	1
and	1
as	1
to	1
your	1
giving	1
them	1
more,	1
it	1
is	1
quite	1
absurd	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
it.	1
They	1
will	1
be	1
much	1
more	1
able	1
to	1
give	1
YOU	1
something."	1
"Upon	1
my	1
word,"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Dashwood,	1
"I	1
believe	1
you	1
are	1
perfectly	1
right.	1
My	1
father	1
certainly	1
could	1
mean	1
nothing	1
more	1
by	1
his	1
request	1
to	1
me	1
than	1
what	1
you	1
say.	1
I	1
clearly	1
understand	1
it	1
now,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
strictly	1
fulfil	1
my	1
engagement	1
by	1
such	1
acts	1
of	1
assistance	1
and	1
kindness	1
to	1
them	1
as	1
you	1
have	1
described.	1
When	1
my	1
mother	1
removes	1
into	1
another	1
house	1
my	1
services	1
shall	1
be	1
readily	1
given	1
to	1
accommodate	1
her	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
I	1
can.	1
Some	1
little	1
present	1
of	1
furniture	1
too	1
may	1
be	1
acceptable	1
then."	1
"Certainly,"	1
returned	1
Mrs.	1
John	1
Dashwood.	1
"But,	1
however,	1
ONE	1
thing	1
must	1
be	1
considered.	1
When	1
your	1
father	1
and	1
mother	1
moved	1
to	1
Norland,	1
though	1
the	1
furniture	1
of	1
Stanhill	1
was	1
sold,	1
all	1
the	1
china,	1
plate,	1
and	1
linen	1
was	1
saved,	1
and	1
is	1
now	1
left	1
to	1
your	1
mother.	1
Her	1
house	1
will	1
therefore	1
be	1
almost	1
completely	1
fitted	1
up	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
takes	1
it."	1
"That	1
is	1
a	1
material	1
consideration	1
undoubtedly.	1
A	1
valuable	1
legacy	1
indeed!	1
And	1
yet	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
plate	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
very	1
pleasant	1
addition	1
to	1
our	1
own	1
stock	1
here."	1
"Yes;	1
and	1
the	1
set	1
of	1
breakfast	1
china	1
is	1
twice	1
as	1
handsome	1
as	1
what	1
belongs	1
to	1
this	1
house.	1
A	1
great	1
deal	1
too	1
handsome,	1
in	1
my	1
opinion,	1
for	1
any	1
place	1
THEY	1
can	1
ever	1
afford	1
to	1
live	1
in.	1
But,	1
however,	1
so	1
it	1
is.	1
Your	1
father	1
thought	1
only	1
of	1
THEM.	1
And	1
I	1
must	1
say	1
this:	1
that	1
you	1
owe	1
no	1
particular	1
gratitude	1
to	1
him,	1
nor	1
attention	1
to	1
his	1
wishes;	1
for	1
we	1
very	1
well	1
know	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
could,	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
left	1
almost	1
everything	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
THEM."	1
This	1
argument	1
was	1
irresistible.	1
It	1
gave	1
to	1
his	1
intentions	1
whatever	1
of	1
decision	1
was	1
wanting	1
before;	1
and	1
he	1
finally	1
resolved,	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
absolutely	1
unnecessary,	1
if	1
not	1
highly	1
indecorous,	1
to	1
do	1
more	1
for	1
the	1
widow	1
and	1
children	1
of	1
his	1
father,	1
than	1
such	1
kind	1
of	1
neighbourly	1
acts	1
as	1
his	1
own	1
wife	1
pointed	1
out.	1
CHAPTER	1
3	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood	1
remained	1
at	1
Norland	1
several	1
months;	1
not	1
from	1
any	1
disinclination	1
to	1
move	1
when	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
every	1
well	1
known	1
spot	1
ceased	1
to	1
raise	1
the	1
violent	1
emotion	1
which	1
it	1
produced	1
for	1
a	1
while;	1
for	1
when	1
her	1
spirits	1
began	1
to	1
revive,	1
and	1
her	1
mind	1
became	1
capable	1
of	1
some	1
other	1
exertion	1
than	1
that	1
of	1
heightening	1
its	1
affliction	1
by	1
melancholy	1
remembrances,	1
she	1
was	1
impatient	1
to	1
be	1
gone,	1
and	1
indefatigable	1
in	1
her	1
inquiries	1
for	1
a	1
suitable	1
dwelling	1
in	1
the	1
neighbourhood	1
of	1
Norland;	1
for	1
to	1
remove	1
far	1
from	1
that	1
beloved	1
spot	1
was	1
impossible.	1
But	1
she	1
could	1
hear	1
of	1
no	1
situation	1
that	1
at	1
once	1
answered	1
her	1
notions	1
of	1
comfort	1
and	1
ease,	1
and	1
suited	1
the	1
prudence	1
of	1
her	1
eldest	1
daughter,	1
whose	1
steadier	1
judgment	1
rejected	1
several	1
houses	1
as	1
too	1
large	1
for	1
their	1
income,	1
which	1
her	1
mother	1
would	1
have	1
approved.	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood	1
had	1
been	1
informed	1
by	1
her	1
husband	1
of	1
the	1
solemn	1
promise	1
on	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
son	1
in	1
their	1
favour,	1
which	1
gave	1
comfort	1
to	1
his	1
last	1
earthly	1
reflections.	1
She	1
doubted	1
the	1
sincerity	1
of	1
this	1
assurance	1
no	1
more	1
than	1
he	1
had	1
doubted	1
it	1
himself,	1
and	1
she	1
thought	1
of	1
it	1
for	1
her	1
daughters'	1
sake	1
with	1
satisfaction,	1
though	1
as	1
for	1
herself	1
she	1
was	1
persuaded	1
that	1
a	1
much	1
smaller	1
provision	1
than	1
7000L	1
would	1
support	1
her	1
in	1
affluence.	1
For	1
their	1
brother's	1
sake,	1
too,	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
heart,	1
she	1
rejoiced;	1
and	1
she	1
reproached	1
herself	1
for	1
being	1
unjust	1
to	1
his	1
merit	1
before,	1
in	1
believing	1
him	1
incapable	1
of	1
generosity.	1
His	1
attentive	1
behaviour	1
to	1
herself	1
and	1
his	1
sisters	1
convinced	1
her	1
that	1
their	1
welfare	1
was	1
dear	1
to	1
him,	1
and,	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time,	1
she	1
firmly	1
relied	1
on	1
the	1
liberality	1
of	1
his	1
intentions.	1
The	1
contempt	1
which	1
she	1
had,	1
very	1
early	1
in	1
their	1
acquaintance,	1
felt	1
for	1
her	1
daughter-in-law,	1
was	1
very	1
much	1
increased	1
by	1
the	1
farther	1
knowledge	1
of	1
her	1
character,	1
which	1
half	1
a	1
year's	1
residence	1
in	1
her	1
family	1
afforded;	1
and	1
perhaps	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
every	1
consideration	1
of	1
politeness	1
or	1
maternal	1
affection	1
on	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
former,	1
the	1
two	1
ladies	1
might	1
have	1
found	1
it	1
impossible	1
to	1
have	1
lived	1
together	1
so	1
long,	1
had	1
not	1
a	1
particular	1
circumstance	1
occurred	1
to	1
give	1
still	1
greater	1
eligibility,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
opinions	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood,	1
to	1
her	1
daughters'	1
continuance	1
at	1
Norland.	1
This	1
circumstance	1
was	1
a	1
growing	1
attachment	1
between	1
her	1
eldest	1
girl	1
and	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
John	1
Dashwood,	1
a	1
gentleman-like	1
and	1
pleasing	1
young	1
man,	1
who	1
was	1
introduced	1
to	1
their	1
acquaintance	1
soon	1
after	1
his	1
sister's	1
establishment	1
at	1
Norland,	1
and	1
who	1
had	1
since	1
spent	1
the	1
greatest	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
time	1
there.	1
Some	1
mothers	1
might	1
have	1
encouraged	1
the	1
intimacy	1
from	1
motives	1
of	1
interest,	1
for	1
Edward	1
Ferrars	1
was	1
the	1
eldest	1
son	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
died	1
very	1
rich;	1
and	1
some	1
might	1
have	1
repressed	1
it	1
from	1
motives	1
of	1
prudence,	1
for,	1
except	1
a	1
trifling	1
sum,	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
his	1
fortune	1
depended	1
on	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
his	1
mother.	1
But	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood	1
was	1
alike	1
uninfluenced	1
by	1
either	1
consideration.	1
It	1
was	1
enough	1
for	1
her	1
that	1
he	1
appeared	1
to	1
be	1
amiable,	1
that	1
he	1
loved	1
her	1
daughter,	1
and	1
that	1
Elinor	1
returned	1
the	1
partiality.	1
It	1
was	1
contrary	1
to	1
every	1
doctrine	1
of	1
her's	1
that	1
difference	1
of	1
fortune	1
should	1
keep	1
any	1
couple	1
asunder	1
who	1
were	1
attracted	1
by	1
resemblance	1
of	1
disposition;	1
and	1
that	1
Elinor's	1
merit	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
acknowledged	1
by	1
every	1
one	1
who	1
knew	1
her,	1
was	1
to	1
her	1
comprehension	1
impossible.	1
Edward	1
Ferrars	1
was	1
not	1
recommended	1
to	1
their	1
good	1
opinion	1
by	1
any	1
peculiar	1
graces	1
of	1
person	1
or	1
address.	1
He	1
was	1
not	1
handsome,	1
and	1
his	1
manners	1
required	1
intimacy	1
to	1
make	1
them	1
pleasing.	1
He	1
was	1
too	1
diffident	1
to	1
do	1
justice	1
to	1
himself;	1
but	1
when	1
his	1
natural	1
shyness	1
was	1
overcome,	1
his	1
behaviour	1
gave	1
every	1
indication	1
of	1
an	1
open,	1
affectionate	1
heart.	1
His	1
understanding	1
was	1
good,	1
and	1
his	1
education	1
had	1
given	1
it	1
solid	1
improvement.	1
But	1
he	1
was	1
neither	1
fitted	1
by	1
abilities	1
nor	1
disposition	1
to	1
answer	1
the	1
wishes	1
of	1
his	1
mother	1
and	1
sister,	1
who	1
longed	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
distinguished--as--they	1
hardly	1
knew	1
what.	1
They	1
wanted	1
him	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
fine	1
figure	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
in	1
some	1
manner	1
or	1
other.	1
His	1
mother	1
wished	1
to	1
interest	1
him	1
in	1
political	1
concerns,	1
to	1
get	1
him	1
into	1
parliament,	1
or	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
connected	1
with	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
day.	1
Mrs.	1
John	1
Dashwood	1
wished	1
it	1
likewise;	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
mean	1
while,	1
till	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
superior	1
blessings	1
could	1
be	1
attained,	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
quieted	1
her	1
ambition	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
driving	1
a	1
barouche.	1
But	1
Edward	1
had	1
no	1
turn	1
for	1
great	1
men	1
or	1
barouches.	1
All	1
his	1
wishes	1
centered	1
in	1
domestic	1
comfort	1
and	1
the	1
quiet	1
of	1
private	1
life.	1
Fortunately	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
younger	1
brother	1
who	1
was	1
more	1
promising.	1
Edward	1
had	1
been	1
staying	1
several	1
weeks	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
before	1
he	1
engaged	1
much	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood's	1
attention;	1
for	1
she	1
was,	1
at	1
that	1
time,	1
in	1
such	1
affliction	1
as	1
rendered	1
her	1
careless	1
of	1
surrounding	1
objects.	1
She	1
saw	1
only	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
quiet	1
and	1
unobtrusive,	1
and	1
she	1
liked	1
him	1
for	1
it.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
disturb	1
the	1
wretchedness	1
of	1
her	1
mind	1
by	1
ill-timed	1
conversation.	1
She	1
was	1
first	1
called	1
to	1
observe	1
and	1
approve	1
him	1
farther,	1
by	1
a	1
reflection	1
which	1
Elinor	1
chanced	1
one	1
day	1
to	1
make	1
on	1
the	1
difference	1
between	1
him	1
and	1
his	1
sister.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
contrast	1
which	1
recommended	1
him	1
most	1
forcibly	1
to	1
her	1
mother.	1
"It	1
is	1
enough,"	1
said	1
she;	1
"to	1
say	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
unlike	1
Fanny	1
is	1
enough.	1
It	1
implies	1
everything	1
amiable.	1
I	1
love	1
him	1
already."	1
"I	1
think	1
you	1
will	1
like	1
him,"	1
said	1
Elinor,	1
"when	1
you	1
know	1
more	1
of	1
him."	1
"Like	1
him!"	1
replied	1
her	1
mother	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
"I	1
feel	1
no	1
sentiment	1
of	1
approbation	1
inferior	1
to	1
love."	1
"You	1
may	1
esteem	1
him."	1
"I	1
have	1
never	1
yet	1
known	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
separate	1
esteem	1
and	1
love."	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood	1
now	1
took	1
pains	1
to	1
get	1
acquainted	1
with	1
him.	1
Her	1
manners	1
were	1
attaching,	1
and	1
soon	1
banished	1
his	1
reserve.	1
She	1
speedily	1
comprehended	1
all	1
his	1
merits;	1
the	1
persuasion	1
of	1
his	1
regard	1
for	1
Elinor	1
perhaps	1
assisted	1
her	1
penetration;	1
but	1
she	1
really	1
felt	1
assured	1
of	1
his	1
worth:	1
and	1
even	1
that	1
quietness	1
of	1
manner,	1
which	1
militated	1
against	1
all	1
her	1
established	1
ideas	1
of	1
what	1
a	1
young	1
man's	1
address	1
ought	1
to	1
be,	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
uninteresting	1
when	1
she	1
knew	1
his	1
heart	1
to	1
be	1
warm	1
and	1
his	1
temper	1
affectionate.	1
No	1
sooner	1
did	1
she	1
perceive	1
any	1
symptom	1
of	1
love	1
in	1
his	1
behaviour	1
to	1
Elinor,	1
than	1
she	1
considered	1
their	1
serious	1
attachment	1
as	1
certain,	1
and	1
looked	1
forward	1
to	1
their	1
marriage	1
as	1
rapidly	1
approaching.	1
"In	1
a	1
few	1
months,	1
my	1
dear	1
Marianne."	1
said	1
she,	1
"Elinor	1
will,	1
in	1
all	1
probability	1
be	1
settled	1
for	1
life.	1
We	1
shall	1
miss	1
her;	1
but	1
SHE	1
will	1
be	1
happy."	1
"Oh!	1
Mamma,	1
how	1
shall	1
we	1
do	1
without	1
her?"	1
"My	1
love,	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
scarcely	1
a	1
separation.	1
We	1
shall	1
live	1
within	1
a	1
few	1
miles	1
of	1
each	1
other,	1
and	1
shall	1
meet	1
every	1
day	1
of	1
our	1
lives.	1
You	1
will	1
gain	1
a	1
brother,	1
a	1
real,	1
affectionate	1
brother.	1
I	1
have	1
the	1
highest	1
opinion	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
of	1
Edward's	1
heart.	1
But	1
you	1
look	1
grave,	1
Marianne;	1
do	1
you	1
disapprove	1
your	1
sister's	1
choice?"	1
"Perhaps,"	1
said	1
Marianne,	1
"I	1
may	1
consider	1
it	1
with	1
some	1
surprise.	1
Edward	1
is	1
very	1
amiable,	1
and	1
I	1
love	1
him	1
tenderly.	1
But	1
yet--he	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
kind	1
of	1
young	1
man--there	1
is	1
something	1
wanting--his	1
figure	1
is	1
not	1
striking;	1
it	1
has	1
none	1
of	1
that	1
grace	1
which	1
I	1
should	1
expect	1
in	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
could	1
seriously	1
attach	1
my	1
sister.	1
His	1
eyes	1
want	1
all	1
that	1
spirit,	1
that	1
fire,	1
which	1
at	1
once	1
announce	1
virtue	1
and	1
intelligence.	1
And	1
besides	1
all	1
this,	1
I	1
am	1
afraid,	1
Mamma,	1
he	1
has	1
no	1
real	1
taste.	1
Music	1
seems	1
scarcely	1
to	1
attract	1
him,	1
and	1
though	1
he	1
admires	1
Elinor's	1
drawings	1
very	1
much,	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
admiration	1
of	1
a	1
person	1
who	1
can	1
understand	1
their	1
worth.	1
It	1
is	1
evident,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
frequent	1
attention	1
to	1
her	1
while	1
she	1
draws,	1
that	1
in	1
fact	1
he	1
knows	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
matter.	1
He	1
admires	1
as	1
a	1
lover,	1
not	1
as	1
a	1
connoisseur.	1
To	1
satisfy	1
me,	1
those	1
characters	1
must	1
be	1
united.	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
happy	1
with	1
a	1
man	1
whose	1
taste	1
did	1
not	1
in	1
every	1
point	1
coincide	1
with	1
my	1
own.	1
He	1
must	1
enter	1
into	1
all	1
my	1
feelings;	1
the	1
same	1
books,	1
the	1
same	1
music	1
must	1
charm	1
us	1
both.	1
Oh!	1
mama,	1
how	1
spiritless,	1
how	1
tame	1
was	1
Edward's	1
manner	1
in	1
reading	1
to	1
us	1
last	1
night!	1
I	1
felt	1
for	1
my	1
sister	1
most	1
severely.	1
Yet	1
she	1
bore	1
it	1
with	1
so	1
much	1
composure,	1
she	1
seemed	1
scarcely	1
to	1
notice	1
it.	1
I	1
could	1
hardly	1
keep	1
my	1
seat.	1
To	1
hear	1
those	1
beautiful	1
lines	1
which	1
have	1
frequently	1
almost	1
driven	1
me	1
wild,	1
pronounced	1
with	1
such	1
impenetrable	1
calmness,	1
such	1
dreadful	1
indifference!"--	1
"He	1
would	1
certainly	1
have	1
done	1
more	1
justice	1
to	1
simple	1
and	1
elegant	1
prose.	1
I	1
thought	1
so	1
at	1
the	1
time;	1
but	1
you	1
WOULD	1
give	1
him	1
Cowper."	1
"Nay,	1
Mamma,	1
if	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
animated	1
by	1
Cowper!--	1
but	1
we	1
must	1
allow	1
for	1
difference	1
of	1
taste.	1
Elinor	1
has	1
not	1
my	1
feelings,	1
and	1
therefore	1
she	1
may	1
overlook	1
it,	1
and	1
be	1
happy	1
with	1
him.	1
But	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
broke	1
MY	1
heart,	1
had	1
I	1
loved	1
him,	1
to	1
hear	1
him	1
read	1
with	1
so	1
little	1
sensibility.	1
Mama,	1
the	1
more	1
I	1
know	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
the	1
more	1
am	1
I	1
convinced	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
never	1
see	1
a	1
man	1
whom	1
I	1
can	1
really	1
love.	1
I	1
require	1
so	1
much!	1
He	1
must	1
have	1
all	1
Edward's	1
virtues,	1
and	1
his	1
person	1
and	1
manners	1
must	1
ornament	1
his	1
goodness	1
with	1
every	1
possible	1
charm."	1
"Remember,	1
my	1
love,	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
seventeen.	1
It	1
is	1
yet	1
too	1
early	1
in	1
life	1
to	1
despair	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
happiness.	1
Why	1
should	1
you	1
be	1
less	1
fortunate	1
than	1
your	1
mother?	1
In	1
one	1
circumstance	1
only,	1
my	1
Marianne,	1
may	1
your	1
destiny	1
be	1
different	1
from	1
her's!"	1
CHAPTER	1
4	1
"What	1
a	1
pity	1
it	1
is,	1
Elinor,"	1
said	1
Marianne,	1
"that	1
Edward	1
should	1
have	1
no	1
taste	1
for	1
drawing."	1
"No	1
taste	1
for	1
drawing!"	1
replied	1
Elinor,	1
"why	1
should	1
you	1
think	1
so?	1
He	1
does	1
not	1
draw	1
himself,	1
indeed,	1
but	1
he	1
has	1
great	1
pleasure	1
in	1
seeing	1
the	1
performances	1
of	1
other	1
people,	1
and	1
I	1
assure	1
you	1
he	1
is	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
deficient	1
in	1
natural	1
taste,	1
though	1
he	1
has	1
not	1
had	1
opportunities	1
of	1
improving	1
it.	1
Had	1
he	1
ever	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
learning,	1
I	1
think	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
drawn	1
very	1
well.	1
He	1
distrusts	1
his	1
own	1
judgment	1
in	1
such	1
matters	1
so	1
much,	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
always	1
unwilling	1
to	1
give	1
his	1
opinion	1
on	1
any	1
picture;	1
but	1
he	1
has	1
an	1
innate	1
propriety	1
and	1
simplicity	1
of	1
taste,	1
which	1
in	1
general	1
direct	1
him	1
perfectly	1
right."	1
Marianne	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
offending,	1
and	1
said	1
no	1
more	1
on	1
the	1
subject;	1
but	1
the	1
kind	1
of	1
approbation	1
which	1
Elinor	1
described	1
as	1
excited	1
in	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
drawings	1
of	1
other	1
people,	1
was	1
very	1
far	1
from	1
that	1
rapturous	1
delight,	1
which,	1
in	1
her	1
opinion,	1
could	1
alone	1
be	1
called	1
taste.	1
Yet,	1
though	1
smiling	1
within	1
herself	1
at	1
the	1
mistake,	1
she	1
honoured	1
her	1
sister	1
for	1
that	1
blind	1
partiality	1
to	1
Edward	1
which	1
produced	1
it.	1
"I	1
hope,	1
Marianne,"	1
continued	1
Elinor,	1
"you	1
do	1
not	1
consider	1
him	1
as	1
deficient	1
in	1
general	1
taste.	1
Indeed,	1
I	1
think	1
I	1
may	1
say	1
that	1
you	1
cannot,	1
for	1
your	1
behaviour	1
to	1
him	1
is	1
perfectly	1
cordial,	1
and	1
if	1
THAT	1
were	1
your	1
opinion,	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
you	1
could	1
never	1
be	1
civil	1
to	1
him."	1
Marianne	1
hardly	1
knew	1
what	1
to	1
say.	1
She	1
would	1
not	1
wound	1
the	1
feelings	1
of	1
her	1
sister	1
on	1
any	1
account,	1
and	1
yet	1
to	1
say	1
what	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
believe	1
was	1
impossible.	1
At	1
length	1
she	1
replied:	1
"Do	1
not	1
be	1
offended,	1
Elinor,	1
if	1
my	1
praise	1
of	1
him	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
every	1
thing	1
equal	1
to	1
your	1
sense	1
of	1
his	1
merits.	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
had	1
so	1
many	1
opportunities	1
of	1
estimating	1
the	1
minuter	1
propensities	1
of	1
his	1
mind,	1
his	1
inclinations	1
and	1
tastes,	1
as	1
you	1
have;	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
the	1
highest	1
opinion	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
of	1
his	1
goodness	1
and	1
sense.	1
I	1
think	1
him	1
every	1
thing	1
that	1
is	1
worthy	1
and	1
amiable."	1
"I	1
am	1
sure,"	1
replied	1
Elinor,	1
with	1
a	1
smile,	1
"that	1
his	1
dearest	1
friends	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
dissatisfied	1
with	1
such	1
commendation	1
as	1
that.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
perceive	1
how	1
you	1
could	1
express	1
yourself	1
more	1
warmly."	1
Marianne	1
was	1
rejoiced	1
to	1
find	1
her	1
sister	1
so	1
easily	1
pleased.	1
"Of	1
his	1
sense	1
and	1
his	1
goodness,"	1
continued	1
Elinor,	1
"no	1
one	1
can,	1
I	1
think,	1
be	1
in	1
doubt,	1
who	1
has	1
seen	1
him	1
often	1
enough	1
to	1
engage	1
him	1
in	1
unreserved	1
conversation.	1
The	1
excellence	1
of	1
his	1
understanding	1
and	1
his	1
principles	1
can	1
be	1
concealed	1
only	1
by	1
that	1
shyness	1
which	1
too	1
often	1
keeps	1
him	1
silent.	1
You	1
know	1
enough	1
of	1
him	1
to	1
do	1
justice	1
to	1
his	1
solid	1
worth.	1
But	1
of	1
his	1
minuter	1
propensities,	1
as	1
you	1
call	1
them	1
you	1
have	1
from	1
peculiar	1
circumstances	1
been	1
kept	1
more	1
ignorant	1
than	1
myself.	1
He	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
at	1
times	1
thrown	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
together,	1
while	1
you	1
have	1
been	1
wholly	1
engrossed	1
on	1
the	1
most	1
affectionate	1
principle	1
by	1
my	1
mother.	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
him,	1
have	1
studied	1
his	1
sentiments	1
and	1
heard	1
his	1
opinion	1
on	1
subjects	1
of	1
literature	1
and	1
taste;	1
and,	1
upon	1
the	1
whole,	1
I	1
venture	1
to	1
pronounce	1
that	1
his	1
mind	1
is	1
well-informed,	1
enjoyment	1
of	1
books	1
exceedingly	1
great,	1
his	1
imagination	1
lively,	1
his	1
observation	1
just	1
and	1
correct,	1
and	1
his	1
taste	1
delicate	1
and	1
pure.	1
His	1
abilities	1
in	1
every	1
respect	1
improve	1
as	1
much	1
upon	1
acquaintance	1
as	1
his	1
manners	1
and	1
person.	1
At	1
first	1
sight,	1
his	1
address	1
is	1
certainly	1
not	1
striking;	1
and	1
his	1
person	1
can	1
hardly	1
be	1
called	1
handsome,	1
till	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
his	1
eyes,	1
which	1
are	1
uncommonly	1
good,	1
and	1
the	1
general	1
sweetness	1
of	1
his	1
countenance,	1
is	1
perceived.	1
At	1
present,	1
I	1
know	1
him	1
so	1
well,	1
that	1
I	1
think	1
him	1
really	1
handsome;	1
or	1
at	1
least,	1
almost	1
so.	1
What	1
say	1
you,	1
Marianne?"	1
"I	1
shall	1
very	1
soon	1
think	1
him	1
handsome,	1
Elinor,	1
if	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
now.	1
When	1
you	1
tell	1
me	1
to	1
love	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
brother,	1
I	1
shall	1
no	1
more	1
see	1
imperfection	1
in	1
his	1
face,	1
than	1
I	1
now	1
do	1
in	1
his	1
heart."	1
Elinor	1
started	1
at	1
this	1
declaration,	1
and	1
was	1
sorry	1
for	1
the	1
warmth	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
betrayed	1
into,	1
in	1
speaking	1
of	1
him.	1
She	1
felt	1
that	1
Edward	1
stood	1
very	1
high	1
in	1
her	1
opinion.	1
She	1
believed	1
the	1
regard	1
to	1
be	1
mutual;	1
but	1
she	1
required	1
greater	1
certainty	1
of	1
it	1
to	1
make	1
Marianne's	1
conviction	1
of	1
their	1
attachment	1
agreeable	1
to	1
her.	1
She	1
knew	1
that	1
what	1
Marianne	1
and	1
her	1
mother	1
conjectured	1
one	1
moment,	1
they	1
believed	1
the	1
next--that	1
with	1
them,	1
to	1
wish	1
was	1
to	1
hope,	1
and	1
to	1
hope	1
was	1
to	1
expect.	1
She	1
tried	1
to	1
explain	1
the	1
real	1
state	1
of	1
the	1
case	1
to	1
her	1
sister.	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
attempt	1
to	1
deny,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"that	1
I	1
think	1
very	1
highly	1
of	1
him--that	1
I	1
greatly	1
esteem,	1
that	1
I	1
like	1
him."	1
Marianne	1
here	1
burst	1
forth	1
with	1
indignation--	1
"Esteem	1
him!	1
Like	1
him!	1
Cold-hearted	1
Elinor!	1
Oh!	1
worse	1
than	1
cold-hearted!	1
Ashamed	1
of	1
being	1
otherwise.	1
Use	1
those	1
words	1
again,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
leave	1
the	1
room	1
this	1
moment."	1
Elinor	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
laughing.	1
"Excuse	1
me,"	1
said	1
she;	1
"and	1
be	1
assured	1
that	1
I	1
meant	1
no	1
offence	1
to	1
you,	1
by	1
speaking,	1
in	1
so	1
quiet	1
a	1
way,	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
feelings.	1
Believe	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
stronger	1
than	1
I	1
have	1
declared;	1
believe	1
them,	1
in	1
short,	1
to	1
be	1
such	1
as	1
his	1
merit,	1
and	1
the	1
suspicion--the	1
hope	1
of	1
his	1
affection	1
for	1
me	1
may	1
warrant,	1
without	1
imprudence	1
or	1
folly.	1
But	1
farther	1
than	1
this	1
you	1
must	1
not	1
believe.	1
I	1
am	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
assured	1
of	1
his	1
regard	1
for	1
me.	1
There	1
are	1
moments	1
when	1
the	1
extent	1
of	1
it	1
seems	1
doubtful;	1
and	1
till	1
his	1
sentiments	1
are	1
fully	1
known,	1
you	1
cannot	1
wonder	1
at	1
my	1
wishing	1
to	1
avoid	1
any	1
encouragement	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
partiality,	1
by	1
believing	1
or	1
calling	1
it	1
more	1
than	1
it	1
is.	1
In	1
my	1
heart	1
I	1
feel	1
little--scarcely	1
any	1
doubt	1
of	1
his	1
preference.	1
But	1
there	1
are	1
other	1
points	1
to	1
be	1
considered	1
besides	1
his	1
inclination.	1
He	1
is	1
very	1
far	1
from	1
being	1
independent.	1
What	1
his	1
mother	1
really	1
is	1
we	1
cannot	1
know;	1
but,	1
from	1
Fanny's	1
occasional	1
mention	1
of	1
her	1
conduct	1
and	1
opinions,	1
we	1
have	1
never	1
been	1
disposed	1
to	1
think	1
her	1
amiable;	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
much	1
mistaken	1
if	1
Edward	1
is	1
not	1
himself	1
aware	1
that	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
many	1
difficulties	1
in	1
his	1
way,	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
to	1
wish	1
to	1
marry	1
a	1
woman	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
either	1
a	1
great	1
fortune	1
or	1
high	1
rank."	1
Marianne	1
was	1
astonished	1
to	1
find	1
how	1
much	1
the	1
imagination	1
of	1
her	1
mother	1
and	1
herself	1
had	1
outstripped	1
the	1
truth.	1
"And	1
you	1
really	1
are	1
not	1
engaged	1
to	1
him!"	1
said	1
she.	1
"Yet	1
it	1
certainly	1
soon	1
will	1
happen.	1
But	1
two	1
advantages	1
will	1
proceed	1
from	1
this	1
delay.	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
lose	1
you	1
so	1
soon,	1
and	1
Edward	1
will	1
have	1
greater	1
opportunity	1
of	1
improving	1
that	1
natural	1
taste	1
for	1
your	1
favourite	1
pursuit	1
which	1
must	1
be	1
so	1
indispensably	1
necessary	1
to	1
your	1
future	1
felicity.	1
Oh!	1
if	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
so	1
far	1
stimulated	1
by	1
your	1
genius	1
as	1
to	1
learn	1
to	1
draw	1
himself,	1
how	1
delightful	1
it	1
would	1
be!"	1
Elinor	1
had	1
given	1
her	1
real	1
opinion	1
to	1
her	1
sister.	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
consider	1
her	1
partiality	1
for	1
Edward	1
in	1
so	1
prosperous	1
a	1
state	1
as	1
Marianne	1
had	1
believed	1
it.	1
There	1
was,	1
at	1
times,	1
a	1
want	1
of	1
spirits	1
about	1
him	1
which,	1
if	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
denote	1
indifference,	1
spoke	1
of	1
something	1
almost	1
as	1
unpromising.	1
A	1
doubt	1
of	1
her	1
regard,	1
supposing	1
him	1
to	1
feel	1
it,	1
need	1
not	1
give	1
him	1
more	1
than	1
inquietude.	1
It	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
likely	1
to	1
produce	1
that	1
dejection	1
of	1
mind	1
which	1
frequently	1
attended	1
him.	1
A	1
more	1
reasonable	1
cause	1
might	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
dependent	1
situation	1
which	1
forbade	1
the	1
indulgence	1
of	1
his	1
affection.	1
She	1
knew	1
that	1
his	1
mother	1
neither	1
behaved	1
to	1
him	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
make	1
his	1
home	1
comfortable	1
at	1
present,	1
nor	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
any	1
assurance	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
form	1
a	1
home	1
for	1
himself,	1
without	1
strictly	1
attending	1
to	1
her	1
views	1
for	1
his	1
aggrandizement.	1
With	1
such	1
a	1
knowledge	1
as	1
this,	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
for	1
Elinor	1
to	1
feel	1
easy	1
on	1
the	1
subject.	1
She	1
was	1
far	1
from	1
depending	1
on	1
that	1
result	1
of	1
his	1
preference	1
of	1
her,	1
which	1
her	1
mother	1
and	1
sister	1
still	1
considered	1
as	1
certain.	1
Nay,	1
the	1
longer	1
they	1
were	1
together	1
the	1
more	1
doubtful	1
seemed	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
his	1
regard;	1
and	1
sometimes,	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
painful	1
minutes,	1
she	1
believed	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
no	1
more	1
than	1
friendship.	1
But,	1
whatever	1
might	1
really	1
be	1
its	1
limits,	1
it	1
was	1
enough,	1
when	1
perceived	1
by	1
his	1
sister,	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
uneasy,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
(which	1
was	1
still	1
more	1
common,)	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
uncivil.	1
She	1
took	1
the	1
first	1
opportunity	1
of	1
affronting	1
her	1
mother-in-law	1
on	1
the	1
occasion,	1
talking	1
to	1
her	1
so	1
expressively	1
of	1
her	1
brother's	1
great	1
expectations,	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
Ferrars's	1
resolution	1
that	1
both	1
her	1
sons	1
should	1
marry	1
well,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
danger	1
attending	1
any	1
young	1
woman	1
who	1
attempted	1
to	1
DRAW	1
HIM	1
IN;	1
that	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood	1
could	1
neither	1
pretend	1
to	1
be	1
unconscious,	1
nor	1
endeavor	1
to	1
be	1
calm.	1
She	1
gave	1
her	1
an	1
answer	1
which	1
marked	1
her	1
contempt,	1
and	1
instantly	1
left	1
the	1
room,	1
resolving	1
that,	1
whatever	1
might	1
be	1
the	1
inconvenience	1
or	1
expense	1
of	1
so	1
sudden	1
a	1
removal,	1
her	1
beloved	1
Elinor	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
exposed	1
another	1
week	1
to	1
such	1
insinuations.	1
In	1
this	1
state	1
of	1
her	1
spirits,	1
a	1
letter	1
was	1
delivered	1
to	1
her	1
from	1
the	1
post,	1
which	1
contained	1
a	1
proposal	1
particularly	1
well	1
timed.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
offer	1
of	1
a	1
small	1
house,	1
on	1
very	1
easy	1
terms,	1
belonging	1
to	1
a	1
relation	1
of	1
her	1
own,	1
a	1
gentleman	1
of	1
consequence	1
and	1
property	1
in	1
Devonshire.	1
The	1
letter	1
was	1
from	1
this	1
gentleman	1
himself,	1
and	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
true	1
spirit	1
of	1
friendly	1
accommodation.	1
He	1
understood	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
need	1
of	1
a	1
dwelling;	1
and	1
though	1
the	1
house	1
he	1
now	1
offered	1
her	1
was	1
merely	1
a	1
cottage,	1
he	1
assured	1
her	1
that	1
everything	1
should	1
be	1
done	1
to	1
it	1
which	1
she	1
might	1
think	1
necessary,	1
if	1
the	1
situation	1
pleased	1
her.	1
He	1
earnestly	1
pressed	1
her,	1
after	1
giving	1
the	1
particulars	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
garden,	1
to	1
come	1
with	1
her	1
daughters	1
to	1
Barton	1
Park,	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
residence,	1
from	1
whence	1
she	1
might	1
judge,	1
herself,	1
whether	1
Barton	1
Cottage,	1
for	1
the	1
houses	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
parish,	1
could,	1
by	1
any	1
alteration,	1
be	1
made	1
comfortable	1
to	1
her.	1
He	1
seemed	1
really	1
anxious	1
to	1
accommodate	1
them	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
his	1
letter	1
was	1
written	1
in	1
so	1
friendly	1
a	1
style	1
as	1
could	1
not	1
fail	1
of	1
giving	1
pleasure	1
to	1
his	1
cousin;	1
more	1
especially	1
at	1
a	1
moment	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
suffering	1
under	1
the	1
cold	1
and	1
unfeeling	1
behaviour	1
of	1
her	1
nearer	1
connections.	1
She	1
needed	1
no	1
time	1
for	1
deliberation	1
or	1
inquiry.	1
Her	1
resolution	1
was	1
formed	1
as	1
she	1
read.	1
The	1
situation	1
of	1
Barton,	1
in	1
a	1
county	1
so	1
far	1
distant	1
from	1
Sussex	1
as	1
Devonshire,	1
which,	1
but	1
a	1
few	1
hours	1
before,	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
sufficient	1
objection	1
to	1
outweigh	1
every	1
possible	1
advantage	1
belonging	1
to	1
the	1
place,	1
was	1
now	1
its	1
first	1
recommendation.	1
To	1
quit	1
the	1
neighbourhood	1
of	1
Norland	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
an	1
evil;	1
it	1
was	1
an	1
object	1
of	1
desire;	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
blessing,	1
in	1
comparison	1
of	1
the	1
misery	1
of	1
continuing	1
her	1
daughter-in-law's	1
guest;	1
and	1
to	1
remove	1
for	1
ever	1
from	1
that	1
beloved	1
place	1
would	1
be	1
less	1
painful	1
than	1
to	1
inhabit	1
or	1
visit	1
it	1
while	1
such	1
a	1
woman	1
was	1
its	1
mistress.	1
She	1
instantly	1
wrote	1
Sir	1
John	1
Middleton	1
her	1
acknowledgment	1
of	1
his	1
kindness,	1
and	1
her	1
acceptance	1
of	1
his	1
proposal;	1
and	1
then	1
hastened	1
to	1
shew	1
both	1
letters	1
to	1
her	1
daughters,	1
that	1
she	1
might	1
be	1
secure	1
of	1
their	1
approbation	1
before	1
her	1
answer	1
were	1
sent.	1
Elinor	1
had	1
always	1
thought	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
more	1
prudent	1
for	1
them	1
to	1
settle	1
at	1
some	1
distance	1
from	1
Norland,	1
than	1
immediately	1
amongst	1
their	1
present	1
acquaintance.	1
On	1
THAT	1
head,	1
therefore,	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
for	1
her	1
to	1
oppose	1
her	1
mother's	1
intention	1
of	1
removing	1
into	1
Devonshire.	1
The	1
house,	1
too,	1
as	1
described	1
by	1
Sir	1
John,	1
was	1
on	1
so	1
simple	1
a	1
scale,	1
and	1
the	1
rent	1
so	1
uncommonly	1
moderate,	1
as	1
to	1
leave	1
her	1
no	1
right	1
of	1
objection	1
on	1
either	1
point;	1
and,	1
therefore,	1
though	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
plan	1
which	1
brought	1
any	1
charm	1
to	1
her	1
fancy,	1
though	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
removal	1
from	1
the	1
vicinity	1
of	1
Norland	1
beyond	1
her	1
wishes,	1
she	1
made	1
no	1
attempt	1
to	1
dissuade	1
her	1
mother	1
from	1
sending	1
a	1
letter	1
of	1
acquiescence.	1
CHAPTER	1
5	1
No	1
sooner	1
was	1
her	1
answer	1
dispatched,	1
than	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood	1
indulged	1
herself	1
in	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
announcing	1
to	1
her	1
son-in-law	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
provided	1
with	1
a	1
house,	1
and	1
should	1
incommode	1
them	1
no	1
longer	1
than	1
till	1
every	1
thing	1
were	1
ready	1
for	1
her	1
inhabiting	1
it.	1
They	1
heard	1
her	1
with	1
surprise.	1
Mrs.	1
John	1
Dashwood	1
said	1
nothing;	1
but	1
her	1
husband	1
civilly	1
hoped	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
settled	1
far	1
from	1
Norland.	1
She	1
had	1
great	1
satisfaction	1
in	1
replying	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
going	1
into	1
Devonshire.--Edward	1
turned	1
hastily	1
towards	1
her,	1
on	1
hearing	1
this,	1
and,	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
of	1
surprise	1
and	1
concern,	1
which	1
required	1
no	1
explanation	1
to	1
her,	1
repeated,	1
"Devonshire!	1
Are	1
you,	1
indeed,	1
going	1
there?	1
So	1
far	1
from	1
hence!	1
And	1
to	1
what	1
part	1
of	1
it?"	1
She	1
explained	1
the	1
situation.	1
It	1
was	1
within	1
four	1
miles	1
northward	1
of	1
Exeter.	1
"It	1
is	1
but	1
a	1
cottage,"	1
she	1
continued,	1
"but	1
I	1
hope	1
to	1
see	1
many	1
of	1
my	1
friends	1
in	1
it.	1
A	1
room	1
or	1
two	1
can	1
easily	1
be	1
added;	1
and	1
if	1
my	1
friends	1
find	1
no	1
difficulty	1
in	1
travelling	1
so	1
far	1
to	1
see	1
me,	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
I	1
will	1
find	1
none	1
in	1
accommodating	1
them."	1
She	1
concluded	1
with	1
a	1
very	1
kind	1
invitation	1
to	1
Mr.	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
John	1
Dashwood	1
to	1
visit	1
her	1
at	1
Barton;	1
and	1
to	1
Edward	1
she	1
gave	1
one	1
with	1
still	1
greater	1
affection.	1
Though	1
her	1
late	1
conversation	1
with	1
her	1
daughter-in-law	1
had	1
made	1
her	1
resolve	1
on	1
remaining	1
at	1
Norland	1
no	1
longer	1
than	1
was	1
unavoidable,	1
it	1
had	1
not	1
produced	1
the	1
smallest	1
effect	1
on	1
her	1
in	1
that	1
point	1
to	1
which	1
it	1
principally	1
tended.	1
To	1
separate	1
Edward	1
and	1
Elinor	1
was	1
as	1
far	1
from	1
being	1
her	1
object	1
as	1
ever;	1
and	1
she	1
wished	1
to	1
show	1
Mrs.	1
John	1
Dashwood,	1
by	1
this	1
pointed	1
invitation	1
to	1
her	1
brother,	1
how	1
totally	1
she	1
disregarded	1
her	1
disapprobation	1
of	1
the	1
match.	1
Mr.	1
John	1
Dashwood	1
told	1
his	1
mother	1
again	1
and	1
again	1
how	1
exceedingly	1
sorry	1
he	1
was	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
taken	1
a	1
house	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
distance	1
from	1
Norland	1
as	1
to	1
prevent	1
his	1
being	1
of	1
any	1
service	1
to	1
her	1
in	1
removing	1
her	1
furniture.	1
He	1
really	1
felt	1
conscientiously	1
vexed	1
on	1
the	1
occasion;	1
for	1
the	1
very	1
exertion	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
limited	1
the	1
performance	1
of	1
his	1
promise	1
to	1
his	1
father	1
was	1
by	1
this	1
arrangement	1
rendered	1
impracticable.--	1
The	1
furniture	1
was	1
all	1
sent	1
around	1
by	1
water.	1
It	1
chiefly	1
consisted	1
of	1
household	1
linen,	1
plate,	1
china,	1
and	1
books,	1
with	1
a	1
handsome	1
pianoforte	1
of	1
Marianne's.	1
Mrs.	1
John	1
Dashwood	1
saw	1
the	1
packages	1
depart	1
with	1
a	1
sigh:	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
feeling	1
it	1
hard	1
that	1
as	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood's	1
income	1
would	1
be	1
so	1
trifling	1
in	1
comparison	1
with	1
their	1
own,	1
she	1
should	1
have	1
any	1
handsome	1
article	1
of	1
furniture.	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood	1
took	1
the	1
house	1
for	1
a	1
twelvemonth;	1
it	1
was	1
ready	1
furnished,	1
and	1
she	1
might	1
have	1
immediate	1
possession.	1
No	1
difficulty	1
arose	1
on	1
either	1
side	1
in	1
the	1
agreement;	1
and	1
she	1
waited	1
only	1
for	1
the	1
disposal	1
of	1
her	1
effects	1
at	1
Norland,	1
and	1
to	1
determine	1
her	1
future	1
household,	1
before	1
she	1
set	1
off	1
for	1
the	1
west;	1
and	1
this,	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
exceedingly	1
rapid	1
in	1
the	1
performance	1
of	1
everything	1
that	1
interested	1
her,	1
was	1
soon	1
done.--The	1
horses	1
which	1
were	1
left	1
her	1
by	1
her	1
husband	1
had	1
been	1
sold	1
soon	1
after	1
his	1
death,	1
and	1
an	1
opportunity	1
now	1
offering	1
of	1
disposing	1
of	1
her	1
carriage,	1
she	1
agreed	1
to	1
sell	1
that	1
likewise	1
at	1
the	1
earnest	1
advice	1
of	1
her	1
eldest	1
daughter.	1
For	1
the	1
comfort	1
of	1
her	1
children,	1
had	1
she	1
consulted	1
only	1
her	1
own	1
wishes,	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
kept	1
it;	1
but	1
the	1
discretion	1
of	1
Elinor	1
prevailed.	1
HER	1
wisdom	1
too	1
limited	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
their	1
servants	1
to	1
three;	1
two	1
maids	1
and	1
a	1
man,	1
with	1
whom	1
they	1
were	1
speedily	1
provided	1
from	1
amongst	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
formed	1
their	1
establishment	1
at	1
Norland.	1
The	1
man	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
maids	1
were	1
sent	1
off	1
immediately	1
into	1
Devonshire,	1
to	1
prepare	1
the	1
house	1
for	1
their	1
mistress's	1
arrival;	1
for	1
as	1
Lady	1
Middleton	1
was	1
entirely	1
unknown	1
to	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood,	1
she	1
preferred	1
going	1
directly	1
to	1
the	1
cottage	1
to	1
being	1
a	1
visitor	1
at	1
Barton	1
Park;	1
and	1
she	1
relied	1
so	1
undoubtingly	1
on	1
Sir	1
John's	1
description	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
as	1
to	1
feel	1
no	1
curiosity	1
to	1
examine	1
it	1
herself	1
till	1
she	1
entered	1
it	1
as	1
her	1
own.	1
Her	1
eagerness	1
to	1
be	1
gone	1
from	1
Norland	1
was	1
preserved	1
from	1
diminution	1
by	1
the	1
evident	1
satisfaction	1
of	1
her	1
daughter-in-law	1
in	1
the	1
prospect	1
of	1
her	1
removal;	1
a	1
satisfaction	1
which	1
was	1
but	1
feebly	1
attempted	1
to	1
be	1
concealed	1
under	1
a	1
cold	1
invitation	1
to	1
her	1
to	1
defer	1
her	1
departure.	1
Now	1
was	1
the	1
time	1
when	1
her	1
son-in-law's	1
promise	1
to	1
his	1
father	1
might	1
with	1
particular	1
propriety	1
be	1
fulfilled.	1
Since	1
he	1
had	1
neglected	1
to	1
do	1
it	1
on	1
first	1
coming	1
to	1
the	1
estate,	1
their	1
quitting	1
his	1
house	1
might	1
be	1
looked	1
on	1
as	1
the	1
most	1
suitable	1
period	1
for	1
its	1
accomplishment.	1
But	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood	1
began	1
shortly	1
to	1
give	1
over	1
every	1
hope	1
of	1
the	1
kind,	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
convinced,	1
from	1
the	1
general	1
drift	1
of	1
his	1
discourse,	1
that	1
his	1
assistance	1
extended	1
no	1
farther	1
than	1
their	1
maintenance	1
for	1
six	1
months	1
at	1
Norland.	1
He	1
so	1
frequently	1
talked	1
of	1
the	1
increasing	1
expenses	1
of	1
housekeeping,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
perpetual	1
demands	1
upon	1
his	1
purse,	1
which	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
any	1
consequence	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
was	1
beyond	1
calculation	1
exposed	1
to,	1
that	1
he	1
seemed	1
rather	1
to	1
stand	1
in	1
need	1
of	1
more	1
money	1
himself	1
than	1
to	1
have	1
any	1
design	1
of	1
giving	1
money	1
away.	1
In	1
a	1
very	1
few	1
weeks	1
from	1
the	1
day	1
which	1
brought	1
Sir	1
John	1
Middleton's	1
first	1
letter	1
to	1
Norland,	1
every	1
thing	1
was	1
so	1
far	1
settled	1
in	1
their	1
future	1
abode	1
as	1
to	1
enable	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood	1
and	1
her	1
daughters	1
to	1
begin	1
their	1
journey.	1
Many	1
were	1
the	1
tears	1
shed	1
by	1
them	1
in	1
their	1
last	1
adieus	1
to	1
a	1
place	1
so	1
much	1
beloved.	1
"Dear,	1
dear	1
Norland!"	1
said	1
Marianne,	1
as	1
she	1
wandered	1
alone	1
before	1
the	1
house,	1
on	1
the	1
last	1
evening	1
of	1
their	1
being	1
there;	1
"when	1
shall	1
I	1
cease	1
to	1
regret	1
you!--when	1
learn	1
to	1
feel	1
a	1
home	1
elsewhere!--Oh!	1
happy	1
house,	1
could	1
you	1
know	1
what	1
I	1
suffer	1
in	1
now	1
viewing	1
you	1
from	1
this	1
spot,	1
from	1
whence	1
perhaps	1
I	1
may	1
view	1
you	1
no	1
more!--And	1
you,	1
ye	1
well-known	1
trees!--but	1
you	1
will	1
continue	1
the	1
same.--No	1
leaf	1
will	1
decay	1
because	1
we	1
are	1
removed,	1
nor	1
any	1
branch	1
become	1
motionless	1
although	1
we	1
can	1
observe	1
you	1
no	1
longer!--No;	1
you	1
will	1
continue	1
the	1
same;	1
unconscious	1
of	1
the	1
pleasure	1
or	1
the	1
regret	1
you	1
occasion,	1
and	1
insensible	1
of	1
any	1
change	1
in	1
those	1
who	1
walk	1
under	1
your	1
shade!--But	1
who	1
will	1
remain	1
to	1
enjoy	1
you?"	1
CHAPTER	1
6	1
The	1
first	1
part	1
of	1
their	1
journey	1
was	1
performed	1
in	1
too	1
melancholy	1
a	1
disposition	1
to	1
be	1
otherwise	1
than	1
tedious	1
and	1
unpleasant.	1
But	1
as	1
they	1
drew	1
towards	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
it,	1
their	1
interest	1
in	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
a	1
country	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
inhabit	1
overcame	1
their	1
dejection,	1
and	1
a	1
view	1
of	1
Barton	1
Valley	1
as	1
they	1
entered	1
it	1
gave	1
them	1
cheerfulness.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
pleasant	1
fertile	1
spot,	1
well	1
wooded,	1
and	1
rich	1
in	1
pasture.	1
After	1
winding	1
along	1
it	1
for	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
mile,	1
they	1
reached	1
their	1
own	1
house.	1
A	1
small	1
green	1
court	1
was	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
its	1
demesne	1
in	1
front;	1
and	1
a	1
neat	1
wicket	1
gate	1
admitted	1
them	1
into	1
it.	1
As	1
a	1
house,	1
Barton	1
Cottage,	1
though	1
small,	1
was	1
comfortable	1
and	1
compact;	1
but	1
as	1
a	1
cottage	1
it	1
was	1
defective,	1
for	1
the	1
building	1
was	1
regular,	1
the	1
roof	1
was	1
tiled,	1
the	1
window	1
shutters	1
were	1
not	1
painted	1
green,	1
nor	1
were	1
the	1
walls	1
covered	1
with	1
honeysuckles.	1
A	1
narrow	1
passage	1
led	1
directly	1
through	1
the	1
house	1
into	1
the	1
garden	1
behind.	1
On	1
each	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
entrance	1
was	1
a	1
sitting	1
room,	1
about	1
sixteen	1
feet	1
square;	1
and	1
beyond	1
them	1
were	1
the	1
offices	1
and	1
the	1
stairs.	1
Four	1
bed-rooms	1
and	1
two	1
garrets	1
formed	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
house.	1
It	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
built	1
many	1
years	1
and	1
was	1
in	1
good	1
repair.	1
In	1
comparison	1
of	1
Norland,	1
it	1
was	1
poor	1
and	1
small	1
indeed!--but	1
the	1
tears	1
which	1
recollection	1
called	1
forth	1
as	1
they	1
entered	1
the	1
house	1
were	1
soon	1
dried	1
away.	1
They	1
were	1
cheered	1
by	1
the	1
joy	1
of	1
the	1
servants	1
on	1
their	1
arrival,	1
and	1
each	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
the	1
others	1
resolved	1
to	1
appear	1
happy.	1
It	1
was	1
very	1
early	1
in	1
September;	1
the	1
season	1
was	1
fine,	1
and	1
from	1
first	1
seeing	1
the	1
place	1
under	1
the	1
advantage	1
of	1
good	1
weather,	1
they	1
received	1
an	1
impression	1
in	1
its	1
favour	1
which	1
was	1
of	1
material	1
service	1
in	1
recommending	1
it	1
to	1
their	1
lasting	1
approbation.	1
The	1
situation	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
was	1
good.	1
High	1
hills	1
rose	1
immediately	1
behind,	1
and	1
at	1
no	1
great	1
distance	1
on	1
each	1
side;	1
some	1
of	1
which	1
were	1
open	1
downs,	1
the	1
others	1
cultivated	1
and	1
woody.	1
The	1
village	1
of	1
Barton	1
was	1
chiefly	1
on	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
hills,	1
and	1
formed	1
a	1
pleasant	1
view	1
from	1
the	1
cottage	1
windows.	1
The	1
prospect	1
in	1
front	1
was	1
more	1
extensive;	1
it	1
commanded	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
the	1
valley,	1
and	1
reached	1
into	1
the	1
country	1
beyond.	1
The	1
hills	1
which	1
surrounded	1
the	1
cottage	1
terminated	1
the	1
valley	1
in	1
that	1
direction;	1
under	1
another	1
name,	1
and	1
in	1
another	1
course,	1
it	1
branched	1
out	1
again	1
between	1
two	1
of	1
the	1
steepest	1
of	1
them.	1
With	1
the	1
size	1
and	1
furniture	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood	1
was	1
upon	1
the	1
whole	1
well	1
satisfied;	1
for	1
though	1
her	1
former	1
style	1
of	1
life	1
rendered	1
many	1
additions	1
to	1
the	1
latter	1
indispensable,	1
yet	1
to	1
add	1
and	1
improve	1
was	1
a	1
delight	1
to	1
her;	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
ready	1
money	1
enough	1
to	1
supply	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
wanted	1
of	1
greater	1
elegance	1
to	1
the	1
apartments.	1
"As	1
for	1
the	1
house	1
itself,	1
to	1
be	1
sure,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"it	1
is	1
too	1
small	1
for	1
our	1
family,	1
but	1
we	1
will	1
make	1
ourselves	1
tolerably	1
comfortable	1
for	1
the	1
present,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
too	1
late	1
in	1
the	1
year	1
for	1
improvements.	1
Perhaps	1
in	1
the	1
spring,	1
if	1
I	1
have	1
plenty	1
of	1
money,	1
as	1
I	1
dare	1
say	1
I	1
shall,	1
we	1
may	1
think	1
about	1
building.	1
These	1
parlors	1
are	1
both	1
too	1
small	1
for	1
such	1
parties	1
of	1
our	1
friends	1
as	1
I	1
hope	1
to	1
see	1
often	1
collected	1
here;	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
some	1
thoughts	1
of	1
throwing	1
the	1
passage	1
into	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
with	1
perhaps	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
other,	1
and	1
so	1
leave	1
the	1
remainder	1
of	1
that	1
other	1
for	1
an	1
entrance;	1
this,	1
with	1
a	1
new	1
drawing	1
room	1
which	1
may	1
be	1
easily	1
added,	1
and	1
a	1
bed-chamber	1
and	1
garret	1
above,	1
will	1
make	1
it	1
a	1
very	1
snug	1
little	1
cottage.	1
I	1
could	1
wish	1
the	1
stairs	1
were	1
handsome.	1
But	1
one	1
must	1
not	1
expect	1
every	1
thing;	1
though	1
I	1
suppose	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
no	1
difficult	1
matter	1
to	1
widen	1
them.	1
I	1
shall	1
see	1
how	1
much	1
I	1
am	1
before-hand	1
with	1
the	1
world	1
in	1
the	1
spring,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
plan	1
our	1
improvements	1
accordingly."	1
In	1
the	1
mean	1
time,	1
till	1
all	1
these	1
alterations	1
could	1
be	1
made	1
from	1
the	1
savings	1
of	1
an	1
income	1
of	1
five	1
hundred	1
a-year	1
by	1
a	1
woman	1
who	1
never	1
saved	1
in	1
her	1
life,	1
they	1
were	1
wise	1
enough	1
to	1
be	1
contented	1
with	1
the	1
house	1
as	1
it	1
was;	1
and	1
each	1
of	1
them	1
was	1
busy	1
in	1
arranging	1
their	1
particular	1
concerns,	1
and	1
endeavoring,	1
by	1
placing	1
around	1
them	1
books	1
and	1
other	1
possessions,	1
to	1
form	1
themselves	1
a	1
home.	1
Marianne's	1
pianoforte	1
was	1
unpacked	1
and	1
properly	1
disposed	1
of;	1
and	1
Elinor's	1
drawings	1
were	1
affixed	1
to	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
their	1
sitting	1
room.	1
In	1
such	1
employments	1
as	1
these	1
they	1
were	1
interrupted	1
soon	1
after	1
breakfast	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
by	1
the	1
entrance	1
of	1
their	1
landlord,	1
who	1
called	1
to	1
welcome	1
them	1
to	1
Barton,	1
and	1
to	1
offer	1
them	1
every	1
accommodation	1
from	1
his	1
own	1
house	1
and	1
garden	1
in	1
which	1
theirs	1
might	1
at	1
present	1
be	1
deficient.	1
Sir	1
John	1
Middleton	1
was	1
a	1
good	1
looking	1
man	1
about	1
forty.	1
He	1
had	1
formerly	1
visited	1
at	1
Stanhill,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
too	1
long	1
for	1
his	1
young	1
cousins	1
to	1
remember	1
him.	1
His	1
countenance	1
was	1
thoroughly	1
good-humoured;	1
and	1
his	1
manners	1
were	1
as	1
friendly	1
as	1
the	1
style	1
of	1
his	1
letter.	1
Their	1
arrival	1
seemed	1
to	1
afford	1
him	1
real	1
satisfaction,	1
and	1
their	1
comfort	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
object	1
of	1
real	1
solicitude	1
to	1
him.	1
He	1
said	1
much	1
of	1
his	1
earnest	1
desire	1
of	1
their	1
living	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
sociable	1
terms	1
with	1
his	1
family,	1
and	1
pressed	1
them	1
so	1
cordially	1
to	1
dine	1
at	1
Barton	1
Park	1
every	1
day	1
till	1
they	1
were	1
better	1
settled	1
at	1
home,	1
that,	1
though	1
his	1
entreaties	1
were	1
carried	1
to	1
a	1
point	1
of	1
perseverance	1
beyond	1
civility,	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
give	1
offence.	1
His	1
kindness	1
was	1
not	1
confined	1
to	1
words;	1
for	1
within	1
an	1
hour	1
after	1
he	1
left	1
them,	1
a	1
large	1
basket	1
full	1
of	1
garden	1
stuff	1
and	1
fruit	1
arrived	1
from	1
the	1
park,	1
which	1
was	1
followed	1
before	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
by	1
a	1
present	1
of	1
game.	1
He	1
insisted,	1
moreover,	1
on	1
conveying	1
all	1
their	1
letters	1
to	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
post	1
for	1
them,	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
denied	1
the	1
satisfaction	1
of	1
sending	1
them	1
his	1
newspaper	1
every	1
day.	1
Lady	1
Middleton	1
had	1
sent	1
a	1
very	1
civil	1
message	1
by	1
him,	1
denoting	1
her	1
intention	1
of	1
waiting	1
on	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
could	1
be	1
assured	1
that	1
her	1
visit	1
would	1
be	1
no	1
inconvenience;	1
and	1
as	1
this	1
message	1
was	1
answered	1
by	1
an	1
invitation	1
equally	1
polite,	1
her	1
ladyship	1
was	1
introduced	1
to	1
them	1
the	1
next	1
day.	1
They	1
were,	1
of	1
course,	1
very	1
anxious	1
to	1
see	1
a	1
person	1
on	1
whom	1
so	1
much	1
of	1
their	1
comfort	1
at	1
Barton	1
must	1
depend;	1
and	1
the	1
elegance	1
of	1
her	1
appearance	1
was	1
favourable	1
to	1
their	1
wishes.	1
Lady	1
Middleton	1
was	1
not	1
more	1
than	1
six	1
or	1
seven	1
and	1
twenty;	1
her	1
face	1
was	1
handsome,	1
her	1
figure	1
tall	1
and	1
striking,	1
and	1
her	1
address	1
graceful.	1
Her	1
manners	1
had	1
all	1
the	1
elegance	1
which	1
her	1
husband's	1
wanted.	1
But	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
improved	1
by	1
some	1
share	1
of	1
his	1
frankness	1
and	1
warmth;	1
and	1
her	1
visit	1
was	1
long	1
enough	1
to	1
detract	1
something	1
from	1
their	1
first	1
admiration,	1
by	1
shewing	1
that,	1
though	1
perfectly	1
well-bred,	1
she	1
was	1
reserved,	1
cold,	1
and	1
had	1
nothing	1
to	1
say	1
for	1
herself	1
beyond	1
the	1
most	1
common-place	1
inquiry	1
or	1
remark.	1
Conversation	1
however	1
was	1
not	1
wanted,	1
for	1
Sir	1
John	1
was	1
very	1
chatty,	1
and	1
Lady	1
Middleton	1
had	1
taken	1
the	1
wise	1
precaution	1
of	1
bringing	1
with	1
her	1
their	1
eldest	1
child,	1
a	1
fine	1
little	1
boy	1
about	1
six	1
years	1
old,	1
by	1
which	1
means	1
there	1
was	1
one	1
subject	1
always	1
to	1
be	1
recurred	1
to	1
by	1
the	1
ladies	1
in	1
case	1
of	1
extremity,	1
for	1
they	1
had	1
to	1
enquire	1
his	1
name	1
and	1
age,	1
admire	1
his	1
beauty,	1
and	1
ask	1
him	1
questions	1
which	1
his	1
mother	1
answered	1
for	1
him,	1
while	1
he	1
hung	1
about	1
her	1
and	1
held	1
down	1
his	1
head,	1
to	1
the	1
great	1
surprise	1
of	1
her	1
ladyship,	1
who	1
wondered	1
at	1
his	1
being	1
so	1
shy	1
before	1
company,	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
make	1
noise	1
enough	1
at	1
home.	1
On	1
every	1
formal	1
visit	1
a	1
child	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
the	1
party,	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
provision	1
for	1
discourse.	1
In	1
the	1
present	1
case	1
it	1
took	1
up	1
ten	1
minutes	1
to	1
determine	1
whether	1
the	1
boy	1
were	1
most	1
like	1
his	1
father	1
or	1
mother,	1
and	1
in	1
what	1
particular	1
he	1
resembled	1
either,	1
for	1
of	1
course	1
every	1
body	1
differed,	1
and	1
every	1
body	1
was	1
astonished	1
at	1
the	1
opinion	1
of	1
the	1
others.	1
An	1
opportunity	1
was	1
soon	1
to	1
be	1
given	1
to	1
the	1
Dashwoods	1
of	1
debating	1
on	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
children,	1
as	1
Sir	1
John	1
would	1
not	1
leave	1
the	1
house	1
without	1
securing	1
their	1
promise	1
of	1
dining	1
at	1
the	1
park	1
the	1
next	1
day.	1
CHAPTER	1
7	1
Barton	1
Park	1
was	1
about	1
half	1
a	1
mile	1
from	1
the	1
cottage.	1
The	1
ladies	1
had	1
passed	1
near	1
it	1
in	1
their	1
way	1
along	1
the	1
valley,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
screened	1
from	1
their	1
view	1
at	1
home	1
by	1
the	1
projection	1
of	1
a	1
hill.	1
The	1
house	1
was	1
large	1
and	1
handsome;	1
and	1
the	1
Middletons	1
lived	1
in	1
a	1
style	1
of	1
equal	1
hospitality	1
and	1
elegance.	1
The	1
former	1
was	1
for	1
Sir	1
John's	1
gratification,	1
the	1
latter	1
for	1
that	1
of	1
his	1
lady.	1
They	1
were	1
scarcely	1
ever	1
without	1
some	1
friends	1
staying	1
with	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
they	1
kept	1
more	1
company	1
of	1
every	1
kind	1
than	1
any	1
other	1
family	1
in	1
the	1
neighbourhood.	1
It	1
was	1
necessary	1
to	1
the	1
happiness	1
of	1
both;	1
for	1
however	1
dissimilar	1
in	1
temper	1
and	1
outward	1
behaviour,	1
they	1
strongly	1
resembled	1
each	1
other	1
in	1
that	1
total	1
want	1
of	1
talent	1
and	1
taste	1
which	1
confined	1
their	1
employments,	1
unconnected	1
with	1
such	1
as	1
society	1
produced,	1
within	1
a	1
very	1
narrow	1
compass.	1
Sir	1
John	1
was	1
a	1
sportsman,	1
Lady	1
Middleton	1
a	1
mother.	1
He	1
hunted	1
and	1
shot,	1
and	1
she	1
humoured	1
her	1
children;	1
and	1
these	1
were	1
their	1
only	1
resources.	1
Lady	1
Middleton	1
had	1
the	1
advantage	1
of	1
being	1
able	1
to	1
spoil	1
her	1
children	1
all	1
the	1
year	1
round,	1
while	1
Sir	1
John's	1
independent	1
employments	1
were	1
in	1
existence	1
only	1
half	1
the	1
time.	1
Continual	1
engagements	1
at	1
home	1
and	1
abroad,	1
however,	1
supplied	1
all	1
the	1
deficiencies	1
of	1
nature	1
and	1
education;	1
supported	1
the	1
good	1
spirits	1
of	1
Sir	1
John,	1
and	1
gave	1
exercise	1
to	1
the	1
good	1
breeding	1
of	1
his	1
wife.	1
Lady	1
Middleton	1
piqued	1
herself	1
upon	1
the	1
elegance	1
of	1
her	1
table,	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
her	1
domestic	1
arrangements;	1
and	1
from	1
this	1
kind	1
of	1
vanity	1
was	1
her	1
greatest	1
enjoyment	1
in	1
any	1
of	1
their	1
parties.	1
But	1
Sir	1
John's	1
satisfaction	1
in	1
society	1
was	1
much	1
more	1
real;	1
he	1
delighted	1
in	1
collecting	1
about	1
him	1
more	1
young	1
people	1
than	1
his	1
house	1
would	1
hold,	1
and	1
the	1
noisier	1
they	1
were	1
the	1
better	1
was	1
he	1
pleased.	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
blessing	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
juvenile	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
neighbourhood,	1
for	1
in	1
summer	1
he	1
was	1
for	1
ever	1
forming	1
parties	1
to	1
eat	1
cold	1
ham	1
and	1
chicken	1
out	1
of	1
doors,	1
and	1
in	1
winter	1
his	1
private	1
balls	1
were	1
numerous	1
enough	1
for	1
any	1
young	1
lady	1
who	1
was	1
not	1
suffering	1
under	1
the	1
unsatiable	1
appetite	1
of	1
fifteen.	1
The	1
arrival	1
of	1
a	1
new	1
family	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
was	1
always	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
joy	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
in	1
every	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
he	1
was	1
charmed	1
with	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
he	1
had	1
now	1
procured	1
for	1
his	1
cottage	1
at	1
Barton.	1
The	1
Miss	1
Dashwoods	1
were	1
young,	1
pretty,	1
and	1
unaffected.	1
It	1
was	1
enough	1
to	1
secure	1
his	1
good	1
opinion;	1
for	1
to	1
be	1
unaffected	1
was	1
all	1
that	1
a	1
pretty	1
girl	1
could	1
want	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
mind	1
as	1
captivating	1
as	1
her	1
person.	1
The	1
friendliness	1
of	1
his	1
disposition	1
made	1
him	1
happy	1
in	1
accommodating	1
those,	1
whose	1
situation	1
might	1
be	1
considered,	1
in	1
comparison	1
with	1
the	1
past,	1
as	1
unfortunate.	1
In	1
showing	1
kindness	1
to	1
his	1
cousins	1
therefore	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
real	1
satisfaction	1
of	1
a	1
good	1
heart;	1
and	1
in	1
settling	1
a	1
family	1
of	1
females	1
only	1
in	1
his	1
cottage,	1
he	1
had	1
all	1
the	1
satisfaction	1
of	1
a	1
sportsman;	1
for	1
a	1
sportsman,	1
though	1
he	1
esteems	1
only	1
those	1
of	1
his	1
sex	1
who	1
are	1
sportsmen	1
likewise,	1
is	1
not	1
often	1
desirous	1
of	1
encouraging	1
their	1
taste	1
by	1
admitting	1
them	1
to	1
a	1
residence	1
within	1
his	1
own	1
manor.	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood	1
and	1
her	1
daughters	1
were	1
met	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
by	1
Sir	1
John,	1
who	1
welcomed	1
them	1
to	1
Barton	1
Park	1
with	1
unaffected	1
sincerity;	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
attended	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
repeated	1
to	1
the	1
young	1
ladies	1
the	1
concern	1
which	1
the	1
same	1
subject	1
had	1
drawn	1
from	1
him	1
the	1
day	1
before,	1
at	1
being	1
unable	1
to	1
get	1
any	1
smart	1
young	1
men	1
to	1
meet	1
them.	1
They	1
would	1
see,	1
he	1
said,	1
only	1
one	1
gentleman	1
there	1
besides	1
himself;	1
a	1
particular	1
friend	1
who	1
was	1
staying	1
at	1
the	1
park,	1
but	1
who	1
was	1
neither	1
very	1
young	1
nor	1
very	1
gay.	1
He	1
hoped	1
they	1
would	1
all	1
excuse	1
the	1
smallness	1
of	1
the	1
party,	1
and	1
could	1
assure	1
them	1
it	1
should	1
never	1
happen	1
so	1
again.	1
He	1
had	1
been	1
to	1
several	1
families	1
that	1
morning	1
in	1
hopes	1
of	1
procuring	1
some	1
addition	1
to	1
their	1
number,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
moonlight	1
and	1
every	1
body	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
engagements.	1
Luckily	1
Lady	1
Middleton's	1
mother	1
had	1
arrived	1
at	1
Barton	1
within	1
the	1
last	1
hour,	1
and	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
cheerful	1
agreeable	1
woman,	1
he	1
hoped	1
the	1
young	1
ladies	1
would	1
not	1
find	1
it	1
so	1
very	1
dull	1
as	1
they	1
might	1
imagine.	1
The	1
young	1
ladies,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
their	1
mother,	1
were	1
perfectly	1
satisfied	1
with	1
having	1
two	1
entire	1
strangers	1
of	1
the	1
party,	1
and	1
wished	1
for	1
no	1
more.	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings,	1
Lady	1
Middleton's	1
mother,	1
was	1
a	1
good-humoured,	1
merry,	1
fat,	1
elderly	1
woman,	1
who	1
talked	1
a	1
great	1
deal,	1
seemed	1
very	1
happy,	1
and	1
rather	1
vulgar.	1
She	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
jokes	1
and	1
laughter,	1
and	1
before	1
dinner	1
was	1
over	1
had	1
said	1
many	1
witty	1
things	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
lovers	1
and	1
husbands;	1
hoped	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
left	1
their	1
hearts	1
behind	1
them	1
in	1
Sussex,	1
and	1
pretended	1
to	1
see	1
them	1
blush	1
whether	1
they	1
did	1
or	1
not.	1
Marianne	1
was	1
vexed	1
at	1
it	1
for	1
her	1
sister's	1
sake,	1
and	1
turned	1
her	1
eyes	1
towards	1
Elinor	1
to	1
see	1
how	1
she	1
bore	1
these	1
attacks,	1
with	1
an	1
earnestness	1
which	1
gave	1
Elinor	1
far	1
more	1
pain	1
than	1
could	1
arise	1
from	1
such	1
common-place	1
raillery	1
as	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings's.	1
Colonel	1
Brandon,	1
the	1
friend	1
of	1
Sir	1
John,	1
seemed	1
no	1
more	1
adapted	1
by	1
resemblance	1
of	1
manner	1
to	1
be	1
his	1
friend,	1
than	1
Lady	1
Middleton	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
his	1
wife,	1
or	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
to	1
be	1
Lady	1
Middleton's	1
mother.	1
He	1
was	1
silent	1
and	1
grave.	1
His	1
appearance	1
however	1
was	1
not	1
unpleasing,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
being	1
in	1
the	1
opinion	1
of	1
Marianne	1
and	1
Margaret	1
an	1
absolute	1
old	1
bachelor,	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
wrong	1
side	1
of	1
five	1
and	1
thirty;	1
but	1
though	1
his	1
face	1
was	1
not	1
handsome,	1
his	1
countenance	1
was	1
sensible,	1
and	1
his	1
address	1
was	1
particularly	1
gentlemanlike.	1
There	1
was	1
nothing	1
in	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
party	1
which	1
could	1
recommend	1
them	1
as	1
companions	1
to	1
the	1
Dashwoods;	1
but	1
the	1
cold	1
insipidity	1
of	1
Lady	1
Middleton	1
was	1
so	1
particularly	1
repulsive,	1
that	1
in	1
comparison	1
of	1
it	1
the	1
gravity	1
of	1
Colonel	1
Brandon,	1
and	1
even	1
the	1
boisterous	1
mirth	1
of	1
Sir	1
John	1
and	1
his	1
mother-in-law	1
was	1
interesting.	1
Lady	1
Middleton	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
roused	1
to	1
enjoyment	1
only	1
by	1
the	1
entrance	1
of	1
her	1
four	1
noisy	1
children	1
after	1
dinner,	1
who	1
pulled	1
her	1
about,	1
tore	1
her	1
clothes,	1
and	1
put	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
every	1
kind	1
of	1
discourse	1
except	1
what	1
related	1
to	1
themselves.	1
In	1
the	1
evening,	1
as	1
Marianne	1
was	1
discovered	1
to	1
be	1
musical,	1
she	1
was	1
invited	1
to	1
play.	1
The	1
instrument	1
was	1
unlocked,	1
every	1
body	1
prepared	1
to	1
be	1
charmed,	1
and	1
Marianne,	1
who	1
sang	1
very	1
well,	1
at	1
their	1
request	1
went	1
through	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
songs	1
which	1
Lady	1
Middleton	1
had	1
brought	1
into	1
the	1
family	1
on	1
her	1
marriage,	1
and	1
which	1
perhaps	1
had	1
lain	1
ever	1
since	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
position	1
on	1
the	1
pianoforte,	1
for	1
her	1
ladyship	1
had	1
celebrated	1
that	1
event	1
by	1
giving	1
up	1
music,	1
although	1
by	1
her	1
mother's	1
account,	1
she	1
had	1
played	1
extremely	1
well,	1
and	1
by	1
her	1
own	1
was	1
very	1
fond	1
of	1
it.	1
Marianne's	1
performance	1
was	1
highly	1
applauded.	1
Sir	1
John	1
was	1
loud	1
in	1
his	1
admiration	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
every	1
song,	1
and	1
as	1
loud	1
in	1
his	1
conversation	1
with	1
the	1
others	1
while	1
every	1
song	1
lasted.	1
Lady	1
Middleton	1
frequently	1
called	1
him	1
to	1
order,	1
wondered	1
how	1
any	1
one's	1
attention	1
could	1
be	1
diverted	1
from	1
music	1
for	1
a	1
moment,	1
and	1
asked	1
Marianne	1
to	1
sing	1
a	1
particular	1
song	1
which	1
Marianne	1
had	1
just	1
finished.	1
Colonel	1
Brandon	1
alone,	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
party,	1
heard	1
her	1
without	1
being	1
in	1
raptures.	1
He	1
paid	1
her	1
only	1
the	1
compliment	1
of	1
attention;	1
and	1
she	1
felt	1
a	1
respect	1
for	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
occasion,	1
which	1
the	1
others	1
had	1
reasonably	1
forfeited	1
by	1
their	1
shameless	1
want	1
of	1
taste.	1
His	1
pleasure	1
in	1
music,	1
though	1
it	1
amounted	1
not	1
to	1
that	1
ecstatic	1
delight	1
which	1
alone	1
could	1
sympathize	1
with	1
her	1
own,	1
was	1
estimable	1
when	1
contrasted	1
against	1
the	1
horrible	1
insensibility	1
of	1
the	1
others;	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
reasonable	1
enough	1
to	1
allow	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
five	1
and	1
thirty	1
might	1
well	1
have	1
outlived	1
all	1
acuteness	1
of	1
feeling	1
and	1
every	1
exquisite	1
power	1
of	1
enjoyment.	1
She	1
was	1
perfectly	1
disposed	1
to	1
make	1
every	1
allowance	1
for	1
the	1
colonel's	1
advanced	1
state	1
of	1
life	1
which	1
humanity	1
required.	1
CHAPTER	1
8	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
was	1
a	1
widow	1
with	1
an	1
ample	1
jointure.	1
She	1
had	1
only	1
two	1
daughters,	1
both	1
of	1
whom	1
she	1
had	1
lived	1
to	1
see	1
respectably	1
married,	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
now	1
therefore	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
but	1
to	1
marry	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
In	1
the	1
promotion	1
of	1
this	1
object	1
she	1
was	1
zealously	1
active,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
her	1
ability	1
reached;	1
and	1
missed	1
no	1
opportunity	1
of	1
projecting	1
weddings	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
young	1
people	1
of	1
her	1
acquaintance.	1
She	1
was	1
remarkably	1
quick	1
in	1
the	1
discovery	1
of	1
attachments,	1
and	1
had	1
enjoyed	1
the	1
advantage	1
of	1
raising	1
the	1
blushes	1
and	1
the	1
vanity	1
of	1
many	1
a	1
young	1
lady	1
by	1
insinuations	1
of	1
her	1
power	1
over	1
such	1
a	1
young	1
man;	1
and	1
this	1
kind	1
of	1
discernment	1
enabled	1
her	1
soon	1
after	1
her	1
arrival	1
at	1
Barton	1
decisively	1
to	1
pronounce	1
that	1
Colonel	1
Brandon	1
was	1
very	1
much	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
Marianne	1
Dashwood.	1
She	1
rather	1
suspected	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
so,	1
on	1
the	1
very	1
first	1
evening	1
of	1
their	1
being	1
together,	1
from	1
his	1
listening	1
so	1
attentively	1
while	1
she	1
sang	1
to	1
them;	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
visit	1
was	1
returned	1
by	1
the	1
Middletons'	1
dining	1
at	1
the	1
cottage,	1
the	1
fact	1
was	1
ascertained	1
by	1
his	1
listening	1
to	1
her	1
again.	1
It	1
must	1
be	1
so.	1
She	1
was	1
perfectly	1
convinced	1
of	1
it.	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
an	1
excellent	1
match,	1
for	1
HE	1
was	1
rich,	1
and	1
SHE	1
was	1
handsome.	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
had	1
been	1
anxious	1
to	1
see	1
Colonel	1
Brandon	1
well	1
married,	1
ever	1
since	1
her	1
connection	1
with	1
Sir	1
John	1
first	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
her	1
knowledge;	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
always	1
anxious	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
good	1
husband	1
for	1
every	1
pretty	1
girl.	1
The	1
immediate	1
advantage	1
to	1
herself	1
was	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
inconsiderable,	1
for	1
it	1
supplied	1
her	1
with	1
endless	1
jokes	1
against	1
them	1
both.	1
At	1
the	1
park	1
she	1
laughed	1
at	1
the	1
colonel,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
cottage	1
at	1
Marianne.	1
To	1
the	1
former	1
her	1
raillery	1
was	1
probably,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
it	1
regarded	1
only	1
himself,	1
perfectly	1
indifferent;	1
but	1
to	1
the	1
latter	1
it	1
was	1
at	1
first	1
incomprehensible;	1
and	1
when	1
its	1
object	1
was	1
understood,	1
she	1
hardly	1
knew	1
whether	1
most	1
to	1
laugh	1
at	1
its	1
absurdity,	1
or	1
censure	1
its	1
impertinence,	1
for	1
she	1
considered	1
it	1
as	1
an	1
unfeeling	1
reflection	1
on	1
the	1
colonel's	1
advanced	1
years,	1
and	1
on	1
his	1
forlorn	1
condition	1
as	1
an	1
old	1
bachelor.	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood,	1
who	1
could	1
not	1
think	1
a	1
man	1
five	1
years	1
younger	1
than	1
herself,	1
so	1
exceedingly	1
ancient	1
as	1
he	1
appeared	1
to	1
the	1
youthful	1
fancy	1
of	1
her	1
daughter,	1
ventured	1
to	1
clear	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
from	1
the	1
probability	1
of	1
wishing	1
to	1
throw	1
ridicule	1
on	1
his	1
age.	1
"But	1
at	1
least,	1
Mamma,	1
you	1
cannot	1
deny	1
the	1
absurdity	1
of	1
the	1
accusation,	1
though	1
you	1
may	1
not	1
think	1
it	1
intentionally	1
ill-natured.	1
Colonel	1
Brandon	1
is	1
certainly	1
younger	1
than	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings,	1
but	1
he	1
is	1
old	1
enough	1
to	1
be	1
MY	1
father;	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
ever	1
animated	1
enough	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
love,	1
must	1
have	1
long	1
outlived	1
every	1
sensation	1
of	1
the	1
kind.	1
It	1
is	1
too	1
ridiculous!	1
When	1
is	1
a	1
man	1
to	1
be	1
safe	1
from	1
such	1
wit,	1
if	1
age	1
and	1
infirmity	1
will	1
not	1
protect	1
him?"	1
"Infirmity!"	1
said	1
Elinor,	1
"do	1
you	1
call	1
Colonel	1
Brandon	1
infirm?	1
I	1
can	1
easily	1
suppose	1
that	1
his	1
age	1
may	1
appear	1
much	1
greater	1
to	1
you	1
than	1
to	1
my	1
mother;	1
but	1
you	1
can	1
hardly	1
deceive	1
yourself	1
as	1
to	1
his	1
having	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
his	1
limbs!"	1
"Did	1
not	1
you	1
hear	1
him	1
complain	1
of	1
the	1
rheumatism?	1
and	1
is	1
not	1
that	1
the	1
commonest	1
infirmity	1
of	1
declining	1
life?"	1
"My	1
dearest	1
child,"	1
said	1
her	1
mother,	1
laughing,	1
"at	1
this	1
rate	1
you	1
must	1
be	1
in	1
continual	1
terror	1
of	1
MY	1
decay;	1
and	1
it	1
must	1
seem	1
to	1
you	1
a	1
miracle	1
that	1
my	1
life	1
has	1
been	1
extended	1
to	1
the	1
advanced	1
age	1
of	1
forty."	1
"Mamma,	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
doing	1
me	1
justice.	1
I	1
know	1
very	1
well	1
that	1
Colonel	1
Brandon	1
is	1
not	1
old	1
enough	1
to	1
make	1
his	1
friends	1
yet	1
apprehensive	1
of	1
losing	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
nature.	1
He	1
may	1
live	1
twenty	1
years	1
longer.	1
But	1
thirty-five	1
has	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
matrimony."	1
"Perhaps,"	1
said	1
Elinor,	1
"thirty-five	1
and	1
seventeen	1
had	1
better	1
not	1
have	1
any	1
thing	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
matrimony	1
together.	1
But	1
if	1
there	1
should	1
by	1
any	1
chance	1
happen	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
woman	1
who	1
is	1
single	1
at	1
seven	1
and	1
twenty,	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
think	1
Colonel	1
Brandon's	1
being	1
thirty-five	1
any	1
objection	1
to	1
his	1
marrying	1
HER."	1
"A	1
woman	1
of	1
seven	1
and	1
twenty,"	1
said	1
Marianne,	1
after	1
pausing	1
a	1
moment,	1
"can	1
never	1
hope	1
to	1
feel	1
or	1
inspire	1
affection	1
again,	1
and	1
if	1
her	1
home	1
be	1
uncomfortable,	1
or	1
her	1
fortune	1
small,	1
I	1
can	1
suppose	1
that	1
she	1
might	1
bring	1
herself	1
to	1
submit	1
to	1
the	1
offices	1
of	1
a	1
nurse,	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
the	1
provision	1
and	1
security	1
of	1
a	1
wife.	1
In	1
his	1
marrying	1
such	1
a	1
woman	1
therefore	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
nothing	1
unsuitable.	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
compact	1
of	1
convenience,	1
and	1
the	1
world	1
would	1
be	1
satisfied.	1
In	1
my	1
eyes	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
no	1
marriage	1
at	1
all,	1
but	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
nothing.	1
To	1
me	1
it	1
would	1
seem	1
only	1
a	1
commercial	1
exchange,	1
in	1
which	1
each	1
wished	1
to	1
be	1
benefited	1
at	1
the	1
expense	1
of	1
the	1
other."	1
"It	1
would	1
be	1
impossible,	1
I	1
know,"	1
replied	1
Elinor,	1
"to	1
convince	1
you	1
that	1
a	1
woman	1
of	1
seven	1
and	1
twenty	1
could	1
feel	1
for	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
thirty-five	1
anything	1
near	1
enough	1
to	1
love,	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
a	1
desirable	1
companion	1
to	1
her.	1
But	1
I	1
must	1
object	1
to	1
your	1
dooming	1
Colonel	1
Brandon	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
to	1
the	1
constant	1
confinement	1
of	1
a	1
sick	1
chamber,	1
merely	1
because	1
he	1
chanced	1
to	1
complain	1
yesterday	1
(a	1
very	1
cold	1
damp	1
day)	1
of	1
a	1
slight	1
rheumatic	1
feel	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
shoulders."	1
"But	1
he	1
talked	1
of	1
flannel	1
waistcoats,"	1
said	1
Marianne;	1
"and	1
with	1
me	1
a	1
flannel	1
waistcoat	1
is	1
invariably	1
connected	1
with	1
aches,	1
cramps,	1
rheumatisms,	1
and	1
every	1
species	1
of	1
ailment	1
that	1
can	1
afflict	1
the	1
old	1
and	1
the	1
feeble."	1
"Had	1
he	1
been	1
only	1
in	1
a	1
violent	1
fever,	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
despised	1
him	1
half	1
so	1
much.	1
Confess,	1
Marianne,	1
is	1
not	1
there	1
something	1
interesting	1
to	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
flushed	1
cheek,	1
hollow	1
eye,	1
and	1
quick	1
pulse	1
of	1
a	1
fever?"	1
Soon	1
after	1
this,	1
upon	1
Elinor's	1
leaving	1
the	1
room,	1
"Mamma,"	1
said	1
Marianne,	1
"I	1
have	1
an	1
alarm	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
illness	1
which	1
I	1
cannot	1
conceal	1
from	1
you.	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
Edward	1
Ferrars	1
is	1
not	1
well.	1
We	1
have	1
now	1
been	1
here	1
almost	1
a	1
fortnight,	1
and	1
yet	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
come.	1
Nothing	1
but	1
real	1
indisposition	1
could	1
occasion	1
this	1
extraordinary	1
delay.	1
What	1
else	1
can	1
detain	1
him	1
at	1
Norland?"	1
"Had	1
you	1
any	1
idea	1
of	1
his	1
coming	1
so	1
soon?"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood.	1
"I	1
had	1
none.	1
On	1
the	1
contrary,	1
if	1
I	1
have	1
felt	1
any	1
anxiety	1
at	1
all	1
on	1
the	1
subject,	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
in	1
recollecting	1
that	1
he	1
sometimes	1
showed	1
a	1
want	1
of	1
pleasure	1
and	1
readiness	1
in	1
accepting	1
my	1
invitation,	1
when	1
I	1
talked	1
of	1
his	1
coming	1
to	1
Barton.	1
Does	1
Elinor	1
expect	1
him	1
already?"	1
"I	1
have	1
never	1
mentioned	1
it	1
to	1
her,	1
but	1
of	1
course	1
she	1
must."	1
"I	1
rather	1
think	1
you	1
are	1
mistaken,	1
for	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
talking	1
to	1
her	1
yesterday	1
of	1
getting	1
a	1
new	1
grate	1
for	1
the	1
spare	1
bedchamber,	1
she	1
observed	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
immediate	1
hurry	1
for	1
it,	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
likely	1
that	1
the	1
room	1
would	1
be	1
wanted	1
for	1
some	1
time."	1
"How	1
strange	1
this	1
is!	1
what	1
can	1
be	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
it!	1
But	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
their	1
behaviour	1
to	1
each	1
other	1
has	1
been	1
unaccountable!	1
How	1
cold,	1
how	1
composed	1
were	1
their	1
last	1
adieus!	1
How	1
languid	1
their	1
conversation	1
the	1
last	1
evening	1
of	1
their	1
being	1
together!	1
In	1
Edward's	1
farewell	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
distinction	1
between	1
Elinor	1
and	1
me:	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
good	1
wishes	1
of	1
an	1
affectionate	1
brother	1
to	1
both.	1
Twice	1
did	1
I	1
leave	1
them	1
purposely	1
together	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
the	1
last	1
morning,	1
and	1
each	1
time	1
did	1
he	1
most	1
unaccountably	1
follow	1
me	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room.	1
And	1
Elinor,	1
in	1
quitting	1
Norland	1
and	1
Edward,	1
cried	1
not	1
as	1
I	1
did.	1
Even	1
now	1
her	1
self-command	1
is	1
invariable.	1
When	1
is	1
she	1
dejected	1
or	1
melancholy?	1
When	1
does	1
she	1
try	1
to	1
avoid	1
society,	1
or	1
appear	1
restless	1
and	1
dissatisfied	1
in	1
it?"	1
CHAPTER	1
9	1
The	1
Dashwoods	1
were	1
now	1
settled	1
at	1
Barton	1
with	1
tolerable	1
comfort	1
to	1
themselves.	1
The	1
house	1
and	1
the	1
garden,	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
objects	1
surrounding	1
them,	1
were	1
now	1
become	1
familiar,	1
and	1
the	1
ordinary	1
pursuits	1
which	1
had	1
given	1
to	1
Norland	1
half	1
its	1
charms	1
were	1
engaged	1
in	1
again	1
with	1
far	1
greater	1
enjoyment	1
than	1
Norland	1
had	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
afford,	1
since	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
their	1
father.	1
Sir	1
John	1
Middleton,	1
who	1
called	1
on	1
them	1
every	1
day	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
fortnight,	1
and	1
who	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
habit	1
of	1
seeing	1
much	1
occupation	1
at	1
home,	1
could	1
not	1
conceal	1
his	1
amazement	1
on	1
finding	1
them	1
always	1
employed.	1
Their	1
visitors,	1
except	1
those	1
from	1
Barton	1
Park,	1
were	1
not	1
many;	1
for,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
Sir	1
John's	1
urgent	1
entreaties	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
mix	1
more	1
in	1
the	1
neighbourhood,	1
and	1
repeated	1
assurances	1
of	1
his	1
carriage	1
being	1
always	1
at	1
their	1
service,	1
the	1
independence	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood's	1
spirit	1
overcame	1
the	1
wish	1
of	1
society	1
for	1
her	1
children;	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
resolute	1
in	1
declining	1
to	1
visit	1
any	1
family	1
beyond	1
the	1
distance	1
of	1
a	1
walk.	1
There	1
were	1
but	1
few	1
who	1
could	1
be	1
so	1
classed;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
attainable.	1
About	1
a	1
mile	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
from	1
the	1
cottage,	1
along	1
the	1
narrow	1
winding	1
valley	1
of	1
Allenham,	1
which	1
issued	1
from	1
that	1
of	1
Barton,	1
as	1
formerly	1
described,	1
the	1
girls	1
had,	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
their	1
earliest	1
walks,	1
discovered	1
an	1
ancient	1
respectable	1
looking	1
mansion	1
which,	1
by	1
reminding	1
them	1
a	1
little	1
of	1
Norland,	1
interested	1
their	1
imagination	1
and	1
made	1
them	1
wish	1
to	1
be	1
better	1
acquainted	1
with	1
it.	1
But	1
they	1
learnt,	1
on	1
enquiry,	1
that	1
its	1
possessor,	1
an	1
elderly	1
lady	1
of	1
very	1
good	1
character,	1
was	1
unfortunately	1
too	1
infirm	1
to	1
mix	1
with	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
never	1
stirred	1
from	1
home.	1
The	1
whole	1
country	1
about	1
them	1
abounded	1
in	1
beautiful	1
walks.	1
The	1
high	1
downs	1
which	1
invited	1
them	1
from	1
almost	1
every	1
window	1
of	1
the	1
cottage	1
to	1
seek	1
the	1
exquisite	1
enjoyment	1
of	1
air	1
on	1
their	1
summits,	1
were	1
a	1
happy	1
alternative	1
when	1
the	1
dirt	1
of	1
the	1
valleys	1
beneath	1
shut	1
up	1
their	1
superior	1
beauties;	1
and	1
towards	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
hills	1
did	1
Marianne	1
and	1
Margaret	1
one	1
memorable	1
morning	1
direct	1
their	1
steps,	1
attracted	1
by	1
the	1
partial	1
sunshine	1
of	1
a	1
showery	1
sky,	1
and	1
unable	1
longer	1
to	1
bear	1
the	1
confinement	1
which	1
the	1
settled	1
rain	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
preceding	1
days	1
had	1
occasioned.	1
The	1
weather	1
was	1
not	1
tempting	1
enough	1
to	1
draw	1
the	1
two	1
others	1
from	1
their	1
pencil	1
and	1
their	1
book,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
Marianne's	1
declaration	1
that	1
the	1
day	1
would	1
be	1
lastingly	1
fair,	1
and	1
that	1
every	1
threatening	1
cloud	1
would	1
be	1
drawn	1
off	1
from	1
their	1
hills;	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
girls	1
set	1
off	1
together.	1
They	1
gaily	1
ascended	1
the	1
downs,	1
rejoicing	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
penetration	1
at	1
every	1
glimpse	1
of	1
blue	1
sky;	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
caught	1
in	1
their	1
faces	1
the	1
animating	1
gales	1
of	1
a	1
high	1
south-westerly	1
wind,	1
they	1
pitied	1
the	1
fears	1
which	1
had	1
prevented	1
their	1
mother	1
and	1
Elinor	1
from	1
sharing	1
such	1
delightful	1
sensations.	1
"Is	1
there	1
a	1
felicity	1
in	1
the	1
world,"	1
said	1
Marianne,	1
"superior	1
to	1
this?--Margaret,	1
we	1
will	1
walk	1
here	1
at	1
least	1
two	1
hours."	1
Margaret	1
agreed,	1
and	1
they	1
pursued	1
their	1
way	1
against	1
the	1
wind,	1
resisting	1
it	1
with	1
laughing	1
delight	1
for	1
about	1
twenty	1
minutes	1
longer,	1
when	1
suddenly	1
the	1
clouds	1
united	1
over	1
their	1
heads,	1
and	1
a	1
driving	1
rain	1
set	1
full	1
in	1
their	1
face.--	1
Chagrined	1
and	1
surprised,	1
they	1
were	1
obliged,	1
though	1
unwillingly,	1
to	1
turn	1
back,	1
for	1
no	1
shelter	1
was	1
nearer	1
than	1
their	1
own	1
house.	1
One	1
consolation	1
however	1
remained	1
for	1
them,	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
exigence	1
of	1
the	1
moment	1
gave	1
more	1
than	1
usual	1
propriety;	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
of	1
running	1
with	1
all	1
possible	1
speed	1
down	1
the	1
steep	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
hill	1
which	1
led	1
immediately	1
to	1
their	1
garden	1
gate.	1
They	1
set	1
off.	1
Marianne	1
had	1
at	1
first	1
the	1
advantage,	1
but	1
a	1
false	1
step	1
brought	1
her	1
suddenly	1
to	1
the	1
ground;	1
and	1
Margaret,	1
unable	1
to	1
stop	1
herself	1
to	1
assist	1
her,	1
was	1
involuntarily	1
hurried	1
along,	1
and	1
reached	1
the	1
bottom	1
in	1
safety.	1
A	1
gentleman	1
carrying	1
a	1
gun,	1
with	1
two	1
pointers	1
playing	1
round	1
him,	1
was	1
passing	1
up	1
the	1
hill	1
and	1
within	1
a	1
few	1
yards	1
of	1
Marianne,	1
when	1
her	1
accident	1
happened.	1
He	1
put	1
down	1
his	1
gun	1
and	1
ran	1
to	1
her	1
assistance.	1
She	1
had	1
raised	1
herself	1
from	1
the	1
ground,	1
but	1
her	1
foot	1
had	1
been	1
twisted	1
in	1
her	1
fall,	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
scarcely	1
able	1
to	1
stand.	1
The	1
gentleman	1
offered	1
his	1
services;	1
and	1
perceiving	1
that	1
her	1
modesty	1
declined	1
what	1
her	1
situation	1
rendered	1
necessary,	1
took	1
her	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
arms	1
without	1
farther	1
delay,	1
and	1
carried	1
her	1
down	1
the	1
hill.	1
Then	1
passing	1
through	1
the	1
garden,	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
left	1
open	1
by	1
Margaret,	1
he	1
bore	1
her	1
directly	1
into	1
the	1
house,	1
whither	1
Margaret	1
was	1
just	1
arrived,	1
and	1
quitted	1
not	1
his	1
hold	1
till	1
he	1
had	1
seated	1
her	1
in	1
a	1
chair	1
in	1
the	1
parlour.	1
Elinor	1
and	1
her	1
mother	1
rose	1
up	1
in	1
amazement	1
at	1
their	1
entrance,	1
and	1
while	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
both	1
were	1
fixed	1
on	1
him	1
with	1
an	1
evident	1
wonder	1
and	1
a	1
secret	1
admiration	1
which	1
equally	1
sprung	1
from	1
his	1
appearance,	1
he	1
apologized	1
for	1
his	1
intrusion	1
by	1
relating	1
its	1
cause,	1
in	1
a	1
manner	1
so	1
frank	1
and	1
so	1
graceful	1
that	1
his	1
person,	1
which	1
was	1
uncommonly	1
handsome,	1
received	1
additional	1
charms	1
from	1
his	1
voice	1
and	1
expression.	1
Had	1
he	1
been	1
even	1
old,	1
ugly,	1
and	1
vulgar,	1
the	1
gratitude	1
and	1
kindness	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
secured	1
by	1
any	1
act	1
of	1
attention	1
to	1
her	1
child;	1
but	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
youth,	1
beauty,	1
and	1
elegance,	1
gave	1
an	1
interest	1
to	1
the	1
action	1
which	1
came	1
home	1
to	1
her	1
feelings.	1
She	1
thanked	1
him	1
again	1
and	1
again;	1
and,	1
with	1
a	1
sweetness	1
of	1
address	1
which	1
always	1
attended	1
her,	1
invited	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
seated.	1
But	1
this	1
he	1
declined,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
dirty	1
and	1
wet.	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood	1
then	1
begged	1
to	1
know	1
to	1
whom	1
she	1
was	1
obliged.	1
His	1
name,	1
he	1
replied,	1
was	1
Willoughby,	1
and	1
his	1
present	1
home	1
was	1
at	1
Allenham,	1
from	1
whence	1
he	1
hoped	1
she	1
would	1
allow	1
him	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
calling	1
tomorrow	1
to	1
enquire	1
after	1
Miss	1
Dashwood.	1
The	1
honour	1
was	1
readily	1
granted,	1
and	1
he	1
then	1
departed,	1
to	1
make	1
himself	1
still	1
more	1
interesting,	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
a	1
heavy	1
rain.	1
His	1
manly	1
beauty	1
and	1
more	1
than	1
common	1
gracefulness	1
were	1
instantly	1
the	1
theme	1
of	1
general	1
admiration,	1
and	1
the	1
laugh	1
which	1
his	1
gallantry	1
raised	1
against	1
Marianne	1
received	1
particular	1
spirit	1
from	1
his	1
exterior	1
attractions.--	1
Marianne	1
herself	1
had	1
seen	1
less	1
of	1
his	1
person	1
that	1
the	1
rest,	1
for	1
the	1
confusion	1
which	1
crimsoned	1
over	1
her	1
face,	1
on	1
his	1
lifting	1
her	1
up,	1
had	1
robbed	1
her	1
of	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
regarding	1
him	1
after	1
their	1
entering	1
the	1
house.	1
But	1
she	1
had	1
seen	1
enough	1
of	1
him	1
to	1
join	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
admiration	1
of	1
the	1
others,	1
and	1
with	1
an	1
energy	1
which	1
always	1
adorned	1
her	1
praise.	1
His	1
person	1
and	1
air	1
were	1
equal	1
to	1
what	1
her	1
fancy	1
had	1
ever	1
drawn	1
for	1
the	1
hero	1
of	1
a	1
favourite	1
story;	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
carrying	1
her	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
with	1
so	1
little	1
previous	1
formality,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
rapidity	1
of	1
thought	1
which	1
particularly	1
recommended	1
the	1
action	1
to	1
her.	1
Every	1
circumstance	1
belonging	1
to	1
him	1
was	1
interesting.	1
His	1
name	1
was	1
good,	1
his	1
residence	1
was	1
in	1
their	1
favourite	1
village,	1
and	1
she	1
soon	1
found	1
out	1
that	1
of	1
all	1
manly	1
dresses	1
a	1
shooting-jacket	1
was	1
the	1
most	1
becoming.	1
Her	1
imagination	1
was	1
busy,	1
her	1
reflections	1
were	1
pleasant,	1
and	1
the	1
pain	1
of	1
a	1
sprained	1
ankle	1
was	1
disregarded.	1
Sir	1
John	1
called	1
on	1
them	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
next	1
interval	1
of	1
fair	1
weather	1
that	1
morning	1
allowed	1
him	1
to	1
get	1
out	1
of	1
doors;	1
and	1
Marianne's	1
accident	1
being	1
related	1
to	1
him,	1
he	1
was	1
eagerly	1
asked	1
whether	1
he	1
knew	1
any	1
gentleman	1
of	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Willoughby	1
at	1
Allenham.	1
"Willoughby!"	1
cried	1
Sir	1
John;	1
"what,	1
is	1
HE	1
in	1
the	1
country?	1
That	1
is	1
good	1
news	1
however;	1
I	1
will	1
ride	1
over	1
tomorrow,	1
and	1
ask	1
him	1
to	1
dinner	1
on	1
Thursday."	1
"You	1
know	1
him	1
then,"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood.	1
"Know	1
him!	1
to	1
be	1
sure	1
I	1
do.	1
Why,	1
he	1
is	1
down	1
here	1
every	1
year."	1
"And	1
what	1
sort	1
of	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
is	1
he?"	1
"As	1
good	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
fellow	1
as	1
ever	1
lived,	1
I	1
assure	1
you.	1
A	1
very	1
decent	1
shot,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
bolder	1
rider	1
in	1
England."	1
"And	1
is	1
that	1
all	1
you	1
can	1
say	1
for	1
him?"	1
cried	1
Marianne,	1
indignantly.	1
"But	1
what	1
are	1
his	1
manners	1
on	1
more	1
intimate	1
acquaintance?	1
What	1
his	1
pursuits,	1
his	1
talents,	1
and	1
genius?"	1
Sir	1
John	1
was	1
rather	1
puzzled.	1
"Upon	1
my	1
soul,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
much	1
about	1
him	1
as	1
to	1
all	1
THAT.	1
But	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
pleasant,	1
good	1
humoured	1
fellow,	1
and	1
has	1
got	1
the	1
nicest	1
little	1
black	1
bitch	1
of	1
a	1
pointer	1
I	1
ever	1
saw.	1
Was	1
she	1
out	1
with	1
him	1
today?"	1
But	1
Marianne	1
could	1
no	1
more	1
satisfy	1
him	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
colour	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Willoughby's	1
pointer,	1
than	1
he	1
could	1
describe	1
to	1
her	1
the	1
shades	1
of	1
his	1
mind.	1
"But	1
who	1
is	1
he?"	1
said	1
Elinor.	1
"Where	1
does	1
he	1
come	1
from?	1
Has	1
he	1
a	1
house	1
at	1
Allenham?"	1
On	1
this	1
point	1
Sir	1
John	1
could	1
give	1
more	1
certain	1
intelligence;	1
and	1
he	1
told	1
them	1
that	1
Mr.	1
Willoughby	1
had	1
no	1
property	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
in	1
the	1
country;	1
that	1
he	1
resided	1
there	1
only	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
visiting	1
the	1
old	1
lady	1
at	1
Allenham	1
Court,	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
was	1
related,	1
and	1
whose	1
possessions	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
inherit;	1
adding,	1
"Yes,	1
yes,	1
he	1
is	1
very	1
well	1
worth	1
catching	1
I	1
can	1
tell	1
you,	1
Miss	1
Dashwood;	1
he	1
has	1
a	1
pretty	1
little	1
estate	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
in	1
Somersetshire	1
besides;	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
were	1
you,	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
give	1
him	1
up	1
to	1
my	1
younger	1
sister,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
this	1
tumbling	1
down	1
hills.	1
Miss	1
Marianne	1
must	1
not	1
expect	1
to	1
have	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
to	1
herself.	1
Brandon	1
will	1
be	1
jealous,	1
if	1
she	1
does	1
not	1
take	1
care."	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
believe,"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood,	1
with	1
a	1
good	1
humoured	1
smile,	1
"that	1
Mr.	1
Willoughby	1
will	1
be	1
incommoded	1
by	1
the	1
attempts	1
of	1
either	1
of	1
MY	1
daughters	1
towards	1
what	1
you	1
call	1
CATCHING	1
him.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
an	1
employment	1
to	1
which	1
they	1
have	1
been	1
brought	1
up.	1
Men	1
are	1
very	1
safe	1
with	1
us,	1
let	1
them	1
be	1
ever	1
so	1
rich.	1
I	1
am	1
glad	1
to	1
find,	1
however,	1
from	1
what	1
you	1
say,	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
respectable	1
young	1
man,	1
and	1
one	1
whose	1
acquaintance	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
ineligible."	1
"He	1
is	1
as	1
good	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
fellow,	1
I	1
believe,	1
as	1
ever	1
lived,"	1
repeated	1
Sir	1
John.	1
"I	1
remember	1
last	1
Christmas	1
at	1
a	1
little	1
hop	1
at	1
the	1
park,	1
he	1
danced	1
from	1
eight	1
o'clock	1
till	1
four,	1
without	1
once	1
sitting	1
down."	1
"Did	1
he	1
indeed?"	1
cried	1
Marianne	1
with	1
sparkling	1
eyes,	1
"and	1
with	1
elegance,	1
with	1
spirit?"	1
"Yes;	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
up	1
again	1
at	1
eight	1
to	1
ride	1
to	1
covert."	1
"That	1
is	1
what	1
I	1
like;	1
that	1
is	1
what	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
ought	1
to	1
be.	1
Whatever	1
be	1
his	1
pursuits,	1
his	1
eagerness	1
in	1
them	1
should	1
know	1
no	1
moderation,	1
and	1
leave	1
him	1
no	1
sense	1
of	1
fatigue."	1
"Aye,	1
aye,	1
I	1
see	1
how	1
it	1
will	1
be,"	1
said	1
Sir	1
John,	1
"I	1
see	1
how	1
it	1
will	1
be.	1
You	1
will	1
be	1
setting	1
your	1
cap	1
at	1
him	1
now,	1
and	1
never	1
think	1
of	1
poor	1
Brandon."	1
"That	1
is	1
an	1
expression,	1
Sir	1
John,"	1
said	1
Marianne,	1
warmly,	1
"which	1
I	1
particularly	1
dislike.	1
I	1
abhor	1
every	1
common-place	1
phrase	1
by	1
which	1
wit	1
is	1
intended;	1
and	1
'setting	1
one's	1
cap	1
at	1
a	1
man,'	1
or	1
'making	1
a	1
conquest,'	1
are	1
the	1
most	1
odious	1
of	1
all.	1
Their	1
tendency	1
is	1
gross	1
and	1
illiberal;	1
and	1
if	1
their	1
construction	1
could	1
ever	1
be	1
deemed	1
clever,	1
time	1
has	1
long	1
ago	1
destroyed	1
all	1
its	1
ingenuity."	1
Sir	1
John	1
did	1
not	1
much	1
understand	1
this	1
reproof;	1
but	1
he	1
laughed	1
as	1
heartily	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
did,	1
and	1
then	1
replied,	1
"Ay,	1
you	1
will	1
make	1
conquests	1
enough,	1
I	1
dare	1
say,	1
one	1
way	1
or	1
other.	1
Poor	1
Brandon!	1
he	1
is	1
quite	1
smitten	1
already,	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
very	1
well	1
worth	1
setting	1
your	1
cap	1
at,	1
I	1
can	1
tell	1
you,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
this	1
tumbling	1
about	1
and	1
spraining	1
of	1
ankles."	1
CHAPTER	1
10	1
Marianne's	1
preserver,	1
as	1
Margaret,	1
with	1
more	1
elegance	1
than	1
precision,	1
styled	1
Willoughby,	1
called	1
at	1
the	1
cottage	1
early	1
the	1
next	1
morning	1
to	1
make	1
his	1
personal	1
enquiries.	1
He	1
was	1
received	1
by	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood	1
with	1
more	1
than	1
politeness;	1
with	1
a	1
kindness	1
which	1
Sir	1
John's	1
account	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
her	1
own	1
gratitude	1
prompted;	1
and	1
every	1
thing	1
that	1
passed	1
during	1
the	1
visit	1
tended	1
to	1
assure	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
sense,	1
elegance,	1
mutual	1
affection,	1
and	1
domestic	1
comfort	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
to	1
whom	1
accident	1
had	1
now	1
introduced	1
him.	1
Of	1
their	1
personal	1
charms	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
required	1
a	1
second	1
interview	1
to	1
be	1
convinced.	1
Miss	1
Dashwood	1
had	1
a	1
delicate	1
complexion,	1
regular	1
features,	1
and	1
a	1
remarkably	1
pretty	1
figure.	1
Marianne	1
was	1
still	1
handsomer.	1
Her	1
form,	1
though	1
not	1
so	1
correct	1
as	1
her	1
sister's,	1
in	1
having	1
the	1
advantage	1
of	1
height,	1
was	1
more	1
striking;	1
and	1
her	1
face	1
was	1
so	1
lovely,	1
that	1
when	1
in	1
the	1
common	1
cant	1
of	1
praise,	1
she	1
was	1
called	1
a	1
beautiful	1
girl,	1
truth	1
was	1
less	1
violently	1
outraged	1
than	1
usually	1
happens.	1
Her	1
skin	1
was	1
very	1
brown,	1
but,	1
from	1
its	1
transparency,	1
her	1
complexion	1
was	1
uncommonly	1
brilliant;	1
her	1
features	1
were	1
all	1
good;	1
her	1
smile	1
was	1
sweet	1
and	1
attractive;	1
and	1
in	1
her	1
eyes,	1
which	1
were	1
very	1
dark,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
life,	1
a	1
spirit,	1
an	1
eagerness,	1
which	1
could	1
hardily	1
be	1
seen	1
without	1
delight.	1
From	1
Willoughby	1
their	1
expression	1
was	1
at	1
first	1
held	1
back,	1
by	1
the	1
embarrassment	1
which	1
the	1
remembrance	1
of	1
his	1
assistance	1
created.	1
But	1
when	1
this	1
passed	1
away,	1
when	1
her	1
spirits	1
became	1
collected,	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
that	1
to	1
the	1
perfect	1
good-breeding	1
of	1
the	1
gentleman,	1
he	1
united	1
frankness	1
and	1
vivacity,	1
and	1
above	1
all,	1
when	1
she	1
heard	1
him	1
declare,	1
that	1
of	1
music	1
and	1
dancing	1
he	1
was	1
passionately	1
fond,	1
she	1
gave	1
him	1
such	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
approbation	1
as	1
secured	1
the	1
largest	1
share	1
of	1
his	1
discourse	1
to	1
herself	1
for	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
his	1
stay.	1
It	1
was	1
only	1
necessary	1
to	1
mention	1
any	1
favourite	1
amusement	1
to	1
engage	1
her	1
to	1
talk.	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
silent	1
when	1
such	1
points	1
were	1
introduced,	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
neither	1
shyness	1
nor	1
reserve	1
in	1
their	1
discussion.	1
They	1
speedily	1
discovered	1
that	1
their	1
enjoyment	1
of	1
dancing	1
and	1
music	1
was	1
mutual,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
arose	1
from	1
a	1
general	1
conformity	1
of	1
judgment	1
in	1
all	1
that	1
related	1
to	1
either.	1
Encouraged	1
by	1
this	1
to	1
a	1
further	1
examination	1
of	1
his	1
opinions,	1
she	1
proceeded	1
to	1
question	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
books;	1
her	1
favourite	1
authors	1
were	1
brought	1
forward	1
and	1
dwelt	1
upon	1
with	1
so	1
rapturous	1
a	1
delight,	1
that	1
any	1
young	1
man	1
of	1
five	1
and	1
twenty	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
insensible	1
indeed,	1
not	1
to	1
become	1
an	1
immediate	1
convert	1
to	1
the	1
excellence	1
of	1
such	1
works,	1
however	1
disregarded	1
before.	1
Their	1
taste	1
was	1
strikingly	1
alike.	1
The	1
same	1
books,	1
the	1
same	1
passages	1
were	1
idolized	1
by	1
each--	1
or	1
if	1
any	1
difference	1
appeared,	1
any	1
objection	1
arose,	1
it	1
lasted	1
no	1
longer	1
than	1
till	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
her	1
arguments	1
and	1
the	1
brightness	1
of	1
her	1
eyes	1
could	1
be	1
displayed.	1
He	1
acquiesced	1
in	1
all	1
her	1
decisions,	1
caught	1
all	1
her	1
enthusiasm;	1
and	1
long	1
before	1
his	1
visit	1
concluded,	1
they	1
conversed	1
with	1
the	1
familiarity	1
of	1
a	1
long-established	1
acquaintance.	1
"Well,	1
Marianne,"	1
said	1
Elinor,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
them,	1
"for	1
ONE	1
morning	1
I	1
think	1
you	1
have	1
done	1
pretty	1
well.	1
You	1
have	1
already	1
ascertained	1
Mr.	1
Willoughby's	1
opinion	1
in	1
almost	1
every	1
matter	1
of	1
importance.	1
You	1
know	1
what	1
he	1
thinks	1
of	1
Cowper	1
and	1
Scott;	1
you	1
are	1
certain	1
of	1
his	1
estimating	1
their	1
beauties	1
as	1
he	1
ought,	1
and	1
you	1
have	1
received	1
every	1
assurance	1
of	1
his	1
admiring	1
Pope	1
no	1
more	1
than	1
is	1
proper.	1
But	1
how	1
is	1
your	1
acquaintance	1
to	1
be	1
long	1
supported,	1
under	1
such	1
extraordinary	1
despatch	1
of	1
every	1
subject	1
for	1
discourse?	1
You	1
will	1
soon	1
have	1
exhausted	1
each	1
favourite	1
topic.	1
Another	1
meeting	1
will	1
suffice	1
to	1
explain	1
his	1
sentiments	1
on	1
picturesque	1
beauty,	1
and	1
second	1
marriages,	1
and	1
then	1
you	1
can	1
have	1
nothing	1
farther	1
to	1
ask."--	1
"Elinor,"	1
cried	1
Marianne,	1
"is	1
this	1
fair?	1
is	1
this	1
just?	1
are	1
my	1
ideas	1
so	1
scanty?	1
But	1
I	1
see	1
what	1
you	1
mean.	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
too	1
much	1
at	1
my	1
ease,	1
too	1
happy,	1
too	1
frank.	1
I	1
have	1
erred	1
against	1
every	1
common-place	1
notion	1
of	1
decorum;	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
open	1
and	1
sincere	1
where	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
reserved,	1
spiritless,	1
dull,	1
and	1
deceitful--had	1
I	1
talked	1
only	1
of	1
the	1
weather	1
and	1
the	1
roads,	1
and	1
had	1
I	1
spoken	1
only	1
once	1
in	1
ten	1
minutes,	1
this	1
reproach	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
spared."	1
"My	1
love,"	1
said	1
her	1
mother,	1
"you	1
must	1
not	1
be	1
offended	1
with	1
Elinor--she	1
was	1
only	1
in	1
jest.	1
I	1
should	1
scold	1
her	1
myself,	1
if	1
she	1
were	1
capable	1
of	1
wishing	1
to	1
check	1
the	1
delight	1
of	1
your	1
conversation	1
with	1
our	1
new	1
friend."--	1
Marianne	1
was	1
softened	1
in	1
a	1
moment.	1
Willoughby,	1
on	1
his	1
side,	1
gave	1
every	1
proof	1
of	1
his	1
pleasure	1
in	1
their	1
acquaintance,	1
which	1
an	1
evident	1
wish	1
of	1
improving	1
it	1
could	1
offer.	1
He	1
came	1
to	1
them	1
every	1
day.	1
To	1
enquire	1
after	1
Marianne	1
was	1
at	1
first	1
his	1
excuse;	1
but	1
the	1
encouragement	1
of	1
his	1
reception,	1
to	1
which	1
every	1
day	1
gave	1
greater	1
kindness,	1
made	1
such	1
an	1
excuse	1
unnecessary	1
before	1
it	1
had	1
ceased	1
to	1
be	1
possible,	1
by	1
Marianne's	1
perfect	1
recovery.	1
She	1
was	1
confined	1
for	1
some	1
days	1
to	1
the	1
house;	1
but	1
never	1
had	1
any	1
confinement	1
been	1
less	1
irksome.	1
Willoughby	1
was	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
of	1
good	1
abilities,	1
quick	1
imagination,	1
lively	1
spirits,	1
and	1
open,	1
affectionate	1
manners.	1
He	1
was	1
exactly	1
formed	1
to	1
engage	1
Marianne's	1
heart,	1
for	1
with	1
all	1
this,	1
he	1
joined	1
not	1
only	1
a	1
captivating	1
person,	1
but	1
a	1
natural	1
ardour	1
of	1
mind	1
which	1
was	1
now	1
roused	1
and	1
increased	1
by	1
the	1
example	1
of	1
her	1
own,	1
and	1
which	1
recommended	1
him	1
to	1
her	1
affection	1
beyond	1
every	1
thing	1
else.	1
His	1
society	1
became	1
gradually	1
her	1
most	1
exquisite	1
enjoyment.	1
They	1
read,	1
they	1
talked,	1
they	1
sang	1
together;	1
his	1
musical	1
talents	1
were	1
considerable;	1
and	1
he	1
read	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
sensibility	1
and	1
spirit	1
which	1
Edward	1
had	1
unfortunately	1
wanted.	1
In	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood's	1
estimation	1
he	1
was	1
as	1
faultless	1
as	1
in	1
Marianne's;	1
and	1
Elinor	1
saw	1
nothing	1
to	1
censure	1
in	1
him	1
but	1
a	1
propensity,	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
strongly	1
resembled	1
and	1
peculiarly	1
delighted	1
her	1
sister,	1
of	1
saying	1
too	1
much	1
what	1
he	1
thought	1
on	1
every	1
occasion,	1
without	1
attention	1
to	1
persons	1
or	1
circumstances.	1
In	1
hastily	1
forming	1
and	1
giving	1
his	1
opinion	1
of	1
other	1
people,	1
in	1
sacrificing	1
general	1
politeness	1
to	1
the	1
enjoyment	1
of	1
undivided	1
attention	1
where	1
his	1
heart	1
was	1
engaged,	1
and	1
in	1
slighting	1
too	1
easily	1
the	1
forms	1
of	1
worldly	1
propriety,	1
he	1
displayed	1
a	1
want	1
of	1
caution	1
which	1
Elinor	1
could	1
not	1
approve,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
and	1
Marianne	1
could	1
say	1
in	1
its	1
support.	1
Marianne	1
began	1
now	1
to	1
perceive	1
that	1
the	1
desperation	1
which	1
had	1
seized	1
her	1
at	1
sixteen	1
and	1
a	1
half,	1
of	1
ever	1
seeing	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
could	1
satisfy	1
her	1
ideas	1
of	1
perfection,	1
had	1
been	1
rash	1
and	1
unjustifiable.	1
Willoughby	1
was	1
all	1
that	1
her	1
fancy	1
had	1
delineated	1
in	1
that	1
unhappy	1
hour	1
and	1
in	1
every	1
brighter	1
period,	1
as	1
capable	1
of	1
attaching	1
her;	1
and	1
his	1
behaviour	1
declared	1
his	1
wishes	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
that	1
respect	1
as	1
earnest,	1
as	1
his	1
abilities	1
were	1
strong.	1
Her	1
mother	1
too,	1
in	1
whose	1
mind	1
not	1
one	1
speculative	1
thought	1
of	1
their	1
marriage	1
had	1
been	1
raised,	1
by	1
his	1
prospect	1
of	1
riches,	1
was	1
led	1
before	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
a	1
week	1
to	1
hope	1
and	1
expect	1
it;	1
and	1
secretly	1
to	1
congratulate	1
herself	1
on	1
having	1
gained	1
two	1
such	1
sons-in-law	1
as	1
Edward	1
and	1
Willoughby.	1
Colonel	1
Brandon's	1
partiality	1
for	1
Marianne,	1
which	1
had	1
so	1
early	1
been	1
discovered	1
by	1
his	1
friends,	1
now	1
first	1
became	1
perceptible	1
to	1
Elinor,	1
when	1
it	1
ceased	1
to	1
be	1
noticed	1
by	1
them.	1
Their	1
attention	1
and	1
wit	1
were	1
drawn	1
off	1
to	1
his	1
more	1
fortunate	1
rival;	1
and	1
the	1
raillery	1
which	1
the	1
other	1
had	1
incurred	1
before	1
any	1
partiality	1
arose,	1
was	1
removed	1
when	1
his	1
feelings	1
began	1
really	1
to	1
call	1
for	1
the	1
ridicule	1
so	1
justly	1
annexed	1
to	1
sensibility.	1
Elinor	1
was	1
obliged,	1
though	1
unwillingly,	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
the	1
sentiments	1
which	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
had	1
assigned	1
him	1
for	1
her	1
own	1
satisfaction,	1
were	1
now	1
actually	1
excited	1
by	1
her	1
sister;	1
and	1
that	1
however	1
a	1
general	1
resemblance	1
of	1
disposition	1
between	1
the	1
parties	1
might	1
forward	1
the	1
affection	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Willoughby,	1
an	1
equally	1
striking	1
opposition	1
of	1
character	1
was	1
no	1
hindrance	1
to	1
the	1
regard	1
of	1
Colonel	1
Brandon.	1
She	1
saw	1
it	1
with	1
concern;	1
for	1
what	1
could	1
a	1
silent	1
man	1
of	1
five	1
and	1
thirty	1
hope,	1
when	1
opposed	1
to	1
a	1
very	1
lively	1
one	1
of	1
five	1
and	1
twenty?	1
and	1
as	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
even	1
wish	1
him	1
successful,	1
she	1
heartily	1
wished	1
him	1
indifferent.	1
She	1
liked	1
him--in	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
gravity	1
and	1
reserve,	1
she	1
beheld	1
in	1
him	1
an	1
object	1
of	1
interest.	1
His	1
manners,	1
though	1
serious,	1
were	1
mild;	1
and	1
his	1
reserve	1
appeared	1
rather	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
some	1
oppression	1
of	1
spirits	1
than	1
of	1
any	1
natural	1
gloominess	1
of	1
temper.	1
Sir	1
John	1
had	1
dropped	1
hints	1
of	1
past	1
injuries	1
and	1
disappointments,	1
which	1
justified	1
her	1
belief	1
of	1
his	1
being	1
an	1
unfortunate	1
man,	1
and	1
she	1
regarded	1
him	1
with	1
respect	1
and	1
compassion.	1
Perhaps	1
she	1
pitied	1
and	1
esteemed	1
him	1
the	1
more	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
slighted	1
by	1
Willoughby	1
and	1
Marianne,	1
who,	1
prejudiced	1
against	1
him	1
for	1
being	1
neither	1
lively	1
nor	1
young,	1
seemed	1
resolved	1
to	1
undervalue	1
his	1
merits.	1
"Brandon	1
is	1
just	1
the	1
kind	1
of	1
man,"	1
said	1
Willoughby	1
one	1
day,	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
talking	1
of	1
him	1
together,	1
"whom	1
every	1
body	1
speaks	1
well	1
of,	1
and	1
nobody	1
cares	1
about;	1
whom	1
all	1
are	1
delighted	1
to	1
see,	1
and	1
nobody	1
remembers	1
to	1
talk	1
to."	1
"That	1
is	1
exactly	1
what	1
I	1
think	1
of	1
him,"	1
cried	1
Marianne.	1
"Do	1
not	1
boast	1
of	1
it,	1
however,"	1
said	1
Elinor,	1
"for	1
it	1
is	1
injustice	1
in	1
both	1
of	1
you.	1
He	1
is	1
highly	1
esteemed	1
by	1
all	1
the	1
family	1
at	1
the	1
park,	1
and	1
I	1
never	1
see	1
him	1
myself	1
without	1
taking	1
pains	1
to	1
converse	1
with	1
him."	1
"That	1
he	1
is	1
patronised	1
by	1
YOU,"	1
replied	1
Willoughby,	1
"is	1
certainly	1
in	1
his	1
favour;	1
but	1
as	1
for	1
the	1
esteem	1
of	1
the	1
others,	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
reproach	1
in	1
itself.	1
Who	1
would	1
submit	1
to	1
the	1
indignity	1
of	1
being	1
approved	1
by	1
such	1
a	1
woman	1
as	1
Lady	1
Middleton	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings,	1
that	1
could	1
command	1
the	1
indifference	1
of	1
any	1
body	1
else?"	1
"But	1
perhaps	1
the	1
abuse	1
of	1
such	1
people	1
as	1
yourself	1
and	1
Marianne	1
will	1
make	1
amends	1
for	1
the	1
regard	1
of	1
Lady	1
Middleton	1
and	1
her	1
mother.	1
If	1
their	1
praise	1
is	1
censure,	1
your	1
censure	1
may	1
be	1
praise,	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
more	1
undiscerning,	1
than	1
you	1
are	1
prejudiced	1
and	1
unjust."	1
"In	1
defence	1
of	1
your	1
protege	1
you	1
can	1
even	1
be	1
saucy."	1
"My	1
protege,	1
as	1
you	1
call	1
him,	1
is	1
a	1
sensible	1
man;	1
and	1
sense	1
will	1
always	1
have	1
attractions	1
for	1
me.	1
Yes,	1
Marianne,	1
even	1
in	1
a	1
man	1
between	1
thirty	1
and	1
forty.	1
He	1
has	1
seen	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
the	1
world;	1
has	1
been	1
abroad,	1
has	1
read,	1
and	1
has	1
a	1
thinking	1
mind.	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
him	1
capable	1
of	1
giving	1
me	1
much	1
information	1
on	1
various	1
subjects;	1
and	1
he	1
has	1
always	1
answered	1
my	1
inquiries	1
with	1
readiness	1
of	1
good-breeding	1
and	1
good	1
nature."	1
"That	1
is	1
to	1
say,"	1
cried	1
Marianne	1
contemptuously,	1
"he	1
has	1
told	1
you,	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
East	1
Indies	1
the	1
climate	1
is	1
hot,	1
and	1
the	1
mosquitoes	1
are	1
troublesome."	1
"He	1
WOULD	1
have	1
told	1
me	1
so,	1
I	1
doubt	1
not,	1
had	1
I	1
made	1
any	1
such	1
inquiries,	1
but	1
they	1
happened	1
to	1
be	1
points	1
on	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
been	1
previously	1
informed."	1
"Perhaps,"	1
said	1
Willoughby,	1
"his	1
observations	1
may	1
have	1
extended	1
to	1
the	1
existence	1
of	1
nabobs,	1
gold	1
mohrs,	1
and	1
palanquins."	1
"I	1
may	1
venture	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
HIS	1
observations	1
have	1
stretched	1
much	1
further	1
than	1
your	1
candour.	1
But	1
why	1
should	1
you	1
dislike	1
him?"	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
dislike	1
him.	1
I	1
consider	1
him,	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
as	1
a	1
very	1
respectable	1
man,	1
who	1
has	1
every	1
body's	1
good	1
word,	1
and	1
nobody's	1
notice;	1
who,	1
has	1
more	1
money	1
than	1
he	1
can	1
spend,	1
more	1
time	1
than	1
he	1
knows	1
how	1
to	1
employ,	1
and	1
two	1
new	1
coats	1
every	1
year."	1
"Add	1
to	1
which,"	1
cried	1
Marianne,	1
"that	1
he	1
has	1
neither	1
genius,	1
taste,	1
nor	1
spirit.	1
That	1
his	1
understanding	1
has	1
no	1
brilliancy,	1
his	1
feelings	1
no	1
ardour,	1
and	1
his	1
voice	1
no	1
expression."	1
"You	1
decide	1
on	1
his	1
imperfections	1
so	1
much	1
in	1
the	1
mass,"	1
replied	1
Elinor,	1
"and	1
so	1
much	1
on	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
your	1
own	1
imagination,	1
that	1
the	1
commendation	1
I	1
am	1
able	1
to	1
give	1
of	1
him	1
is	1
comparatively	1
cold	1
and	1
insipid.	1
I	1
can	1
only	1
pronounce	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
sensible	1
man,	1
well-bred,	1
well-informed,	1
of	1
gentle	1
address,	1
and,	1
I	1
believe,	1
possessing	1
an	1
amiable	1
heart."	1
"Miss	1
Dashwood,"	1
cried	1
Willoughby,	1
"you	1
are	1
now	1
using	1
me	1
unkindly.	1
You	1
are	1
endeavouring	1
to	1
disarm	1
me	1
by	1
reason,	1
and	1
to	1
convince	1
me	1
against	1
my	1
will.	1
But	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
do.	1
You	1
shall	1
find	1
me	1
as	1
stubborn	1
as	1
you	1
can	1
be	1
artful.	1
I	1
have	1
three	1
unanswerable	1
reasons	1
for	1
disliking	1
Colonel	1
Brandon;	1
he	1
threatened	1
me	1
with	1
rain	1
when	1
I	1
wanted	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
fine;	1
he	1
has	1
found	1
fault	1
with	1
the	1
hanging	1
of	1
my	1
curricle,	1
and	1
I	1
cannot	1
persuade	1
him	1
to	1
buy	1
my	1
brown	1
mare.	1
If	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
any	1
satisfaction	1
to	1
you,	1
however,	1
to	1
be	1
told,	1
that	1
I	1
believe	1
his	1
character	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
other	1
respects	1
irreproachable,	1
I	1
am	1
ready	1
to	1
confess	1
it.	1
And	1
in	1
return	1
for	1
an	1
acknowledgment,	1
which	1
must	1
give	1
me	1
some	1
pain,	1
you	1
cannot	1
deny	1
me	1
the	1
privilege	1
of	1
disliking	1
him	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
ever."	1
CHAPTER	1
11	1
Little	1
had	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood	1
or	1
her	1
daughters	1
imagined	1
when	1
they	1
first	1
came	1
into	1
Devonshire,	1
that	1
so	1
many	1
engagements	1
would	1
arise	1
to	1
occupy	1
their	1
time	1
as	1
shortly	1
presented	1
themselves,	1
or	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
have	1
such	1
frequent	1
invitations	1
and	1
such	1
constant	1
visitors	1
as	1
to	1
leave	1
them	1
little	1
leisure	1
for	1
serious	1
employment.	1
Yet	1
such	1
was	1
the	1
case.	1
When	1
Marianne	1
was	1
recovered,	1
the	1
schemes	1
of	1
amusement	1
at	1
home	1
and	1
abroad,	1
which	1
Sir	1
John	1
had	1
been	1
previously	1
forming,	1
were	1
put	1
into	1
execution.	1
The	1
private	1
balls	1
at	1
the	1
park	1
then	1
began;	1
and	1
parties	1
on	1
the	1
water	1
were	1
made	1
and	1
accomplished	1
as	1
often	1
as	1
a	1
showery	1
October	1
would	1
allow.	1
In	1
every	1
meeting	1
of	1
the	1
kind	1
Willoughby	1
was	1
included;	1
and	1
the	1
ease	1
and	1
familiarity	1
which	1
naturally	1
attended	1
these	1
parties	1
were	1
exactly	1
calculated	1
to	1
give	1
increasing	1
intimacy	1
to	1
his	1
acquaintance	1
with	1
the	1
Dashwoods,	1
to	1
afford	1
him	1
opportunity	1
of	1
witnessing	1
the	1
excellencies	1
of	1
Marianne,	1
of	1
marking	1
his	1
animated	1
admiration	1
of	1
her,	1
and	1
of	1
receiving,	1
in	1
her	1
behaviour	1
to	1
himself,	1
the	1
most	1
pointed	1
assurance	1
of	1
her	1
affection.	1
Elinor	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
surprised	1
at	1
their	1
attachment.	1
She	1
only	1
wished	1
that	1
it	1
were	1
less	1
openly	1
shewn;	1
and	1
once	1
or	1
twice	1
did	1
venture	1
to	1
suggest	1
the	1
propriety	1
of	1
some	1
self-command	1
to	1
Marianne.	1
But	1
Marianne	1
abhorred	1
all	1
concealment	1
where	1
no	1
real	1
disgrace	1
could	1
attend	1
unreserve;	1
and	1
to	1
aim	1
at	1
the	1
restraint	1
of	1
sentiments	1
which	1
were	1
not	1
in	1
themselves	1
illaudable,	1
appeared	1
to	1
her	1
not	1
merely	1
an	1
unnecessary	1
effort,	1
but	1
a	1
disgraceful	1
subjection	1
of	1
reason	1
to	1
common-place	1
and	1
mistaken	1
notions.	1
Willoughby	1
thought	1
the	1
same;	1
and	1
their	1
behaviour	1
at	1
all	1
times,	1
was	1
an	1
illustration	1
of	1
their	1
opinions.	1
When	1
he	1
was	1
present	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
eyes	1
for	1
any	1
one	1
else.	1
Every	1
thing	1
he	1
did,	1
was	1
right.	1
Every	1
thing	1
he	1
said,	1
was	1
clever.	1
If	1
their	1
evenings	1
at	1
the	1
park	1
were	1
concluded	1
with	1
cards,	1
he	1
cheated	1
himself	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
party	1
to	1
get	1
her	1
a	1
good	1
hand.	1
If	1
dancing	1
formed	1
the	1
amusement	1
of	1
the	1
night,	1
they	1
were	1
partners	1
for	1
half	1
the	1
time;	1
and	1
when	1
obliged	1
to	1
separate	1
for	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
dances,	1
were	1
careful	1
to	1
stand	1
together	1
and	1
scarcely	1
spoke	1
a	1
word	1
to	1
any	1
body	1
else.	1
Such	1
conduct	1
made	1
them	1
of	1
course	1
most	1
exceedingly	1
laughed	1
at;	1
but	1
ridicule	1
could	1
not	1
shame,	1
and	1
seemed	1
hardly	1
to	1
provoke	1
them.	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood	1
entered	1
into	1
all	1
their	1
feelings	1
with	1
a	1
warmth	1
which	1
left	1
her	1
no	1
inclination	1
for	1
checking	1
this	1
excessive	1
display	1
of	1
them.	1
To	1
her	1
it	1
was	1
but	1
the	1
natural	1
consequence	1
of	1
a	1
strong	1
affection	1
in	1
a	1
young	1
and	1
ardent	1
mind.	1
This	1
was	1
the	1
season	1
of	1
happiness	1
to	1
Marianne.	1
Her	1
heart	1
was	1
devoted	1
to	1
Willoughby,	1
and	1
the	1
fond	1
attachment	1
to	1
Norland,	1
which	1
she	1
brought	1
with	1
her	1
from	1
Sussex,	1
was	1
more	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
softened	1
than	1
she	1
had	1
thought	1
it	1
possible	1
before,	1
by	1
the	1
charms	1
which	1
his	1
society	1
bestowed	1
on	1
her	1
present	1
home.	1
Elinor's	1
happiness	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
great.	1
Her	1
heart	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
at	1
ease,	1
nor	1
her	1
satisfaction	1
in	1
their	1
amusements	1
so	1
pure.	1
They	1
afforded	1
her	1
no	1
companion	1
that	1
could	1
make	1
amends	1
for	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
left	1
behind,	1
nor	1
that	1
could	1
teach	1
her	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
Norland	1
with	1
less	1
regret	1
than	1
ever.	1
Neither	1
Lady	1
Middleton	1
nor	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
could	1
supply	1
to	1
her	1
the	1
conversation	1
she	1
missed;	1
although	1
the	1
latter	1
was	1
an	1
everlasting	1
talker,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
had	1
regarded	1
her	1
with	1
a	1
kindness	1
which	1
ensured	1
her	1
a	1
large	1
share	1
of	1
her	1
discourse.	1
She	1
had	1
already	1
repeated	1
her	1
own	1
history	1
to	1
Elinor	1
three	1
or	1
four	1
times;	1
and	1
had	1
Elinor's	1
memory	1
been	1
equal	1
to	1
her	1
means	1
of	1
improvement,	1
she	1
might	1
have	1
known	1
very	1
early	1
in	1
their	1
acquaintance	1
all	1
the	1
particulars	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Jenning's	1
last	1
illness,	1
and	1
what	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
before	1
he	1
died.	1
Lady	1
Middleton	1
was	1
more	1
agreeable	1
than	1
her	1
mother	1
only	1
in	1
being	1
more	1
silent.	1
Elinor	1
needed	1
little	1
observation	1
to	1
perceive	1
that	1
her	1
reserve	1
was	1
a	1
mere	1
calmness	1
of	1
manner	1
with	1
which	1
sense	1
had	1
nothing	1
to	1
do.	1
Towards	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
mother	1
she	1
was	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
to	1
them;	1
and	1
intimacy	1
was	1
therefore	1
neither	1
to	1
be	1
looked	1
for	1
nor	1
desired.	1
She	1
had	1
nothing	1
to	1
say	1
one	1
day	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
said	1
the	1
day	1
before.	1
Her	1
insipidity	1
was	1
invariable,	1
for	1
even	1
her	1
spirits	1
were	1
always	1
the	1
same;	1
and	1
though	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
oppose	1
the	1
parties	1
arranged	1
by	1
her	1
husband,	1
provided	1
every	1
thing	1
were	1
conducted	1
in	1
style	1
and	1
her	1
two	1
eldest	1
children	1
attended	1
her,	1
she	1
never	1
appeared	1
to	1
receive	1
more	1
enjoyment	1
from	1
them	1
than	1
she	1
might	1
have	1
experienced	1
in	1
sitting	1
at	1
home;--	1
and	1
so	1
little	1
did	1
her	1
presence	1
add	1
to	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
the	1
others,	1
by	1
any	1
share	1
in	1
their	1
conversation,	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
sometimes	1
only	1
reminded	1
of	1
her	1
being	1
amongst	1
them	1
by	1
her	1
solicitude	1
about	1
her	1
troublesome	1
boys.	1
In	1
Colonel	1
Brandon	1
alone,	1
of	1
all	1
her	1
new	1
acquaintance,	1
did	1
Elinor	1
find	1
a	1
person	1
who	1
could	1
in	1
any	1
degree	1
claim	1
the	1
respect	1
of	1
abilities,	1
excite	1
the	1
interest	1
of	1
friendship,	1
or	1
give	1
pleasure	1
as	1
a	1
companion.	1
Willoughby	1
was	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
question.	1
Her	1
admiration	1
and	1
regard,	1
even	1
her	1
sisterly	1
regard,	1
was	1
all	1
his	1
own;	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
lover;	1
his	1
attentions	1
were	1
wholly	1
Marianne's,	1
and	1
a	1
far	1
less	1
agreeable	1
man	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
more	1
generally	1
pleasing.	1
Colonel	1
Brandon,	1
unfortunately	1
for	1
himself,	1
had	1
no	1
such	1
encouragement	1
to	1
think	1
only	1
of	1
Marianne,	1
and	1
in	1
conversing	1
with	1
Elinor	1
he	1
found	1
the	1
greatest	1
consolation	1
for	1
the	1
indifference	1
of	1
her	1
sister.	1
Elinor's	1
compassion	1
for	1
him	1
increased,	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
reason	1
to	1
suspect	1
that	1
the	1
misery	1
of	1
disappointed	1
love	1
had	1
already	1
been	1
known	1
to	1
him.	1
This	1
suspicion	1
was	1
given	1
by	1
some	1
words	1
which	1
accidently	1
dropped	1
from	1
him	1
one	1
evening	1
at	1
the	1
park,	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
sitting	1
down	1
together	1
by	1
mutual	1
consent,	1
while	1
the	1
others	1
were	1
dancing.	1
His	1
eyes	1
were	1
fixed	1
on	1
Marianne,	1
and,	1
after	1
a	1
silence	1
of	1
some	1
minutes,	1
he	1
said,	1
with	1
a	1
faint	1
smile,	1
"Your	1
sister,	1
I	1
understand,	1
does	1
not	1
approve	1
of	1
second	1
attachments."	1
"No,"	1
replied	1
Elinor,	1
"her	1
opinions	1
are	1
all	1
romantic."	1
"Or	1
rather,	1
as	1
I	1
believe,	1
she	1
considers	1
them	1
impossible	1
to	1
exist."	1
"I	1
believe	1
she	1
does.	1
But	1
how	1
she	1
contrives	1
it	1
without	1
reflecting	1
on	1
the	1
character	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
father,	1
who	1
had	1
himself	1
two	1
wives,	1
I	1
know	1
not.	1
A	1
few	1
years	1
however	1
will	1
settle	1
her	1
opinions	1
on	1
the	1
reasonable	1
basis	1
of	1
common	1
sense	1
and	1
observation;	1
and	1
then	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
more	1
easy	1
to	1
define	1
and	1
to	1
justify	1
than	1
they	1
now	1
are,	1
by	1
any	1
body	1
but	1
herself."	1
"This	1
will	1
probably	1
be	1
the	1
case,"	1
he	1
replied;	1
"and	1
yet	1
there	1
is	1
something	1
so	1
amiable	1
in	1
the	1
prejudices	1
of	1
a	1
young	1
mind,	1
that	1
one	1
is	1
sorry	1
to	1
see	1
them	1
give	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
reception	1
of	1
more	1
general	1
opinions."	1
"I	1
cannot	1
agree	1
with	1
you	1
there,"	1
said	1
Elinor.	1
"There	1
are	1
inconveniences	1
attending	1
such	1
feelings	1
as	1
Marianne's,	1
which	1
all	1
the	1
charms	1
of	1
enthusiasm	1
and	1
ignorance	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
cannot	1
atone	1
for.	1
Her	1
systems	1
have	1
all	1
the	1
unfortunate	1
tendency	1
of	1
setting	1
propriety	1
at	1
nought;	1
and	1
a	1
better	1
acquaintance	1
with	1
the	1
world	1
is	1
what	1
I	1
look	1
forward	1
to	1
as	1
her	1
greatest	1
possible	1
advantage."	1
After	1
a	1
short	1
pause	1
he	1
resumed	1
the	1
conversation	1
by	1
saying,--	1
"Does	1
your	1
sister	1
make	1
no	1
distinction	1
in	1
her	1
objections	1
against	1
a	1
second	1
attachment?	1
or	1
is	1
it	1
equally	1
criminal	1
in	1
every	1
body?	1
Are	1
those	1
who	1
have	1
been	1
disappointed	1
in	1
their	1
first	1
choice,	1
whether	1
from	1
the	1
inconstancy	1
of	1
its	1
object,	1
or	1
the	1
perverseness	1
of	1
circumstances,	1
to	1
be	1
equally	1
indifferent	1
during	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
their	1
lives?"	1
"Upon	1
my	1
word,	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
acquainted	1
with	1
the	1
minutiae	1
of	1
her	1
principles.	1
I	1
only	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
never	1
yet	1
heard	1
her	1
admit	1
any	1
instance	1
of	1
a	1
second	1
attachment's	1
being	1
pardonable."	1
"This,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"cannot	1
hold;	1
but	1
a	1
change,	1
a	1
total	1
change	1
of	1
sentiments--No,	1
no,	1
do	1
not	1
desire	1
it;	1
for	1
when	1
the	1
romantic	1
refinements	1
of	1
a	1
young	1
mind	1
are	1
obliged	1
to	1
give	1
way,	1
how	1
frequently	1
are	1
they	1
succeeded	1
by	1
such	1
opinions	1
as	1
are	1
but	1
too	1
common,	1
and	1
too	1
dangerous!	1
I	1
speak	1
from	1
experience.	1
I	1
once	1
knew	1
a	1
lady	1
who	1
in	1
temper	1
and	1
mind	1
greatly	1
resembled	1
your	1
sister,	1
who	1
thought	1
and	1
judged	1
like	1
her,	1
but	1
who	1
from	1
an	1
inforced	1
change--from	1
a	1
series	1
of	1
unfortunate	1
circumstances"--	1
Here	1
he	1
stopt	1
suddenly;	1
appeared	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
too	1
much,	1
and	1
by	1
his	1
countenance	1
gave	1
rise	1
to	1
conjectures,	1
which	1
might	1
not	1
otherwise	1
have	1
entered	1
Elinor's	1
head.	1
The	1
lady	1
would	1
probably	1
have	1
passed	1
without	1
suspicion,	1
had	1
he	1
not	1
convinced	1
Miss	1
Dashwood	1
that	1
what	1
concerned	1
her	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
escape	1
his	1
lips.	1
As	1
it	1
was,	1
it	1
required	1
but	1
a	1
slight	1
effort	1
of	1
fancy	1
to	1
connect	1
his	1
emotion	1
with	1
the	1
tender	1
recollection	1
of	1
past	1
regard.	1
Elinor	1
attempted	1
no	1
more.	1
But	1
Marianne,	1
in	1
her	1
place,	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
done	1
so	1
little.	1
The	1
whole	1
story	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
speedily	1
formed	1
under	1
her	1
active	1
imagination;	1
and	1
every	1
thing	1
established	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
melancholy	1
order	1
of	1
disastrous	1
love.	1
CHAPTER	1
12	1
As	1
Elinor	1
and	1
Marianne	1
were	1
walking	1
together	1
the	1
next	1
morning	1
the	1
latter	1
communicated	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
news	1
to	1
her	1
sister,	1
which	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
she	1
knew	1
before	1
of	1
Marianne's	1
imprudence	1
and	1
want	1
of	1
thought,	1
surprised	1
her	1
by	1
its	1
extravagant	1
testimony	1
of	1
both.	1
Marianne	1
told	1
her,	1
with	1
the	1
greatest	1
delight,	1
that	1
Willoughby	1
had	1
given	1
her	1
a	1
horse,	1
one	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
bred	1
himself	1
on	1
his	1
estate	1
in	1
Somersetshire,	1
and	1
which	1
was	1
exactly	1
calculated	1
to	1
carry	1
a	1
woman.	1
Without	1
considering	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
her	1
mother's	1
plan	1
to	1
keep	1
any	1
horse,	1
that	1
if	1
she	1
were	1
to	1
alter	1
her	1
resolution	1
in	1
favour	1
of	1
this	1
gift,	1
she	1
must	1
buy	1
another	1
for	1
the	1
servant,	1
and	1
keep	1
a	1
servant	1
to	1
ride	1
it,	1
and	1
after	1
all,	1
build	1
a	1
stable	1
to	1
receive	1
them,	1
she	1
had	1
accepted	1
the	1
present	1
without	1
hesitation,	1
and	1
told	1
her	1
sister	1
of	1
it	1
in	1
raptures.	1
"He	1
intends	1
to	1
send	1
his	1
groom	1
into	1
Somersetshire	1
immediately	1
for	1
it,"	1
she	1
added,	1
"and	1
when	1
it	1
arrives	1
we	1
will	1
ride	1
every	1
day.	1
You	1
shall	1
share	1
its	1
use	1
with	1
me.	1
Imagine	1
to	1
yourself,	1
my	1
dear	1
Elinor,	1
the	1
delight	1
of	1
a	1
gallop	1
on	1
some	1
of	1
these	1
downs."	1
Most	1
unwilling	1
was	1
she	1
to	1
awaken	1
from	1
such	1
a	1
dream	1
of	1
felicity	1
to	1
comprehend	1
all	1
the	1
unhappy	1
truths	1
which	1
attended	1
the	1
affair;	1
and	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
she	1
refused	1
to	1
submit	1
to	1
them.	1
As	1
to	1
an	1
additional	1
servant,	1
the	1
expense	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
trifle;	1
Mamma	1
she	1
was	1
sure	1
would	1
never	1
object	1
to	1
it;	1
and	1
any	1
horse	1
would	1
do	1
for	1
HIM;	1
he	1
might	1
always	1
get	1
one	1
at	1
the	1
park;	1
as	1
to	1
a	1
stable,	1
the	1
merest	1
shed	1
would	1
be	1
sufficient.	1
Elinor	1
then	1
ventured	1
to	1
doubt	1
the	1
propriety	1
of	1
her	1
receiving	1
such	1
a	1
present	1
from	1
a	1
man	1
so	1
little,	1
or	1
at	1
least	1
so	1
lately	1
known	1
to	1
her.	1
This	1
was	1
too	1
much.	1
"You	1
are	1
mistaken,	1
Elinor,"	1
said	1
she	1
warmly,	1
"in	1
supposing	1
I	1
know	1
very	1
little	1
of	1
Willoughby.	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
known	1
him	1
long	1
indeed,	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
much	1
better	1
acquainted	1
with	1
him,	1
than	1
I	1
am	1
with	1
any	1
other	1
creature	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
except	1
yourself	1
and	1
mama.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
time	1
or	1
opportunity	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
determine	1
intimacy;--	1
it	1
is	1
disposition	1
alone.	1
Seven	1
years	1
would	1
be	1
insufficient	1
to	1
make	1
some	1
people	1
acquainted	1
with	1
each	1
other,	1
and	1
seven	1
days	1
are	1
more	1
than	1
enough	1
for	1
others.	1
I	1
should	1
hold	1
myself	1
guilty	1
of	1
greater	1
impropriety	1
in	1
accepting	1
a	1
horse	1
from	1
my	1
brother,	1
than	1
from	1
Willoughby.	1
Of	1
John	1
I	1
know	1
very	1
little,	1
though	1
we	1
have	1
lived	1
together	1
for	1
years;	1
but	1
of	1
Willoughby	1
my	1
judgment	1
has	1
long	1
been	1
formed."	1
Elinor	1
thought	1
it	1
wisest	1
to	1
touch	1
that	1
point	1
no	1
more.	1
She	1
knew	1
her	1
sister's	1
temper.	1
Opposition	1
on	1
so	1
tender	1
a	1
subject	1
would	1
only	1
attach	1
her	1
the	1
more	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
opinion.	1
But	1
by	1
an	1
appeal	1
to	1
her	1
affection	1
for	1
her	1
mother,	1
by	1
representing	1
the	1
inconveniences	1
which	1
that	1
indulgent	1
mother	1
must	1
draw	1
on	1
herself,	1
if	1
(as	1
would	1
probably	1
be	1
the	1
case)	1
she	1
consented	1
to	1
this	1
increase	1
of	1
establishment,	1
Marianne	1
was	1
shortly	1
subdued;	1
and	1
she	1
promised	1
not	1
to	1
tempt	1
her	1
mother	1
to	1
such	1
imprudent	1
kindness	1
by	1
mentioning	1
the	1
offer,	1
and	1
to	1
tell	1
Willoughby	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
him	1
next,	1
that	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
declined.	1
She	1
was	1
faithful	1
to	1
her	1
word;	1
and	1
when	1
Willoughby	1
called	1
at	1
the	1
cottage,	1
the	1
same	1
day,	1
Elinor	1
heard	1
her	1
express	1
her	1
disappointment	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice,	1
on	1
being	1
obliged	1
to	1
forego	1
the	1
acceptance	1
of	1
his	1
present.	1
The	1
reasons	1
for	1
this	1
alteration	1
were	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
related,	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
such	1
as	1
to	1
make	1
further	1
entreaty	1
on	1
his	1
side	1
impossible.	1
His	1
concern	1
however	1
was	1
very	1
apparent;	1
and	1
after	1
expressing	1
it	1
with	1
earnestness,	1
he	1
added,	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
low	1
voice,--"But,	1
Marianne,	1
the	1
horse	1
is	1
still	1
yours,	1
though	1
you	1
cannot	1
use	1
it	1
now.	1
I	1
shall	1
keep	1
it	1
only	1
till	1
you	1
can	1
claim	1
it.	1
When	1
you	1
leave	1
Barton	1
to	1
form	1
your	1
own	1
establishment	1
in	1
a	1
more	1
lasting	1
home,	1
Queen	1
Mab	1
shall	1
receive	1
you."	1
This	1
was	1
all	1
overheard	1
by	1
Miss	1
Dashwood;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
the	1
sentence,	1
in	1
his	1
manner	1
of	1
pronouncing	1
it,	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
addressing	1
her	1
sister	1
by	1
her	1
Christian	1
name	1
alone,	1
she	1
instantly	1
saw	1
an	1
intimacy	1
so	1
decided,	1
a	1
meaning	1
so	1
direct,	1
as	1
marked	1
a	1
perfect	1
agreement	1
between	1
them.	1
From	1
that	1
moment	1
she	1
doubted	1
not	1
of	1
their	1
being	1
engaged	1
to	1
each	1
other;	1
and	1
the	1
belief	1
of	1
it	1
created	1
no	1
other	1
surprise	1
than	1
that	1
she,	1
or	1
any	1
of	1
their	1
friends,	1
should	1
be	1
left	1
by	1
tempers	1
so	1
frank,	1
to	1
discover	1
it	1
by	1
accident.	1
Margaret	1
related	1
something	1
to	1
her	1
the	1
next	1
day,	1
which	1
placed	1
this	1
matter	1
in	1
a	1
still	1
clearer	1
light.	1
Willoughby	1
had	1
spent	1
the	1
preceding	1
evening	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
Margaret,	1
by	1
being	1
left	1
some	1
time	1
in	1
the	1
parlour	1
with	1
only	1
him	1
and	1
Marianne,	1
had	1
had	1
opportunity	1
for	1
observations,	1
which,	1
with	1
a	1
most	1
important	1
face,	1
she	1
communicated	1
to	1
her	1
eldest	1
sister,	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
next	1
by	1
themselves.	1
"Oh,	1
Elinor!"	1
she	1
cried,	1
"I	1
have	1
such	1
a	1
secret	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
about	1
Marianne.	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
she	1
will	1
be	1
married	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Willoughby	1
very	1
soon."	1
"You	1
have	1
said	1
so,"	1
replied	1
Elinor,	1
"almost	1
every	1
day	1
since	1
they	1
first	1
met	1
on	1
High-church	1
Down;	1
and	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
known	1
each	1
other	1
a	1
week,	1
I	1
believe,	1
before	1
you	1
were	1
certain	1
that	1
Marianne	1
wore	1
his	1
picture	1
round	1
her	1
neck;	1
but	1
it	1
turned	1
out	1
to	1
be	1
only	1
the	1
miniature	1
of	1
our	1
great	1
uncle."	1
"But	1
indeed	1
this	1
is	1
quite	1
another	1
thing.	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
they	1
will	1
be	1
married	1
very	1
soon,	1
for	1
he	1
has	1
got	1
a	1
lock	1
of	1
her	1
hair."	1
"Take	1
care,	1
Margaret.	1
It	1
may	1
be	1
only	1
the	1
hair	1
of	1
some	1
great	1
uncle	1
of	1
HIS."	1
"But,	1
indeed,	1
Elinor,	1
it	1
is	1
Marianne's.	1
I	1
am	1
almost	1
sure	1
it	1
is,	1
for	1
I	1
saw	1
him	1
cut	1
it	1
off.	1
Last	1
night	1
after	1
tea,	1
when	1
you	1
and	1
mama	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room,	1
they	1
were	1
whispering	1
and	1
talking	1
together	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
could	1
be,	1
and	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
begging	1
something	1
of	1
her,	1
and	1
presently	1
he	1
took	1
up	1
her	1
scissors	1
and	1
cut	1
off	1
a	1
long	1
lock	1
of	1
her	1
hair,	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
tumbled	1
down	1
her	1
back;	1
and	1
he	1
kissed	1
it,	1
and	1
folded	1
it	1
up	1
in	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
white	1
paper;	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
into	1
his	1
pocket-book."	1
For	1
such	1
particulars,	1
stated	1
on	1
such	1
authority,	1
Elinor	1
could	1
not	1
withhold	1
her	1
credit;	1
nor	1
was	1
she	1
disposed	1
to	1
it,	1
for	1
the	1
circumstance	1
was	1
in	1
perfect	1
unison	1
with	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
heard	1
and	1
seen	1
herself.	1
Margaret's	1
sagacity	1
was	1
not	1
always	1
displayed	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
so	1
satisfactory	1
to	1
her	1
sister.	1
When	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
attacked	1
her	1
one	1
evening	1
at	1
the	1
park,	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
who	1
was	1
Elinor's	1
particular	1
favourite,	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
long	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
great	1
curiosity	1
to	1
her,	1
Margaret	1
answered	1
by	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
sister,	1
and	1
saying,	1
"I	1
must	1
not	1
tell,	1
may	1
I,	1
Elinor?"	1
This	1
of	1
course	1
made	1
every	1
body	1
laugh;	1
and	1
Elinor	1
tried	1
to	1
laugh	1
too.	1
But	1
the	1
effort	1
was	1
painful.	1
She	1
was	1
convinced	1
that	1
Margaret	1
had	1
fixed	1
on	1
a	1
person	1
whose	1
name	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
bear	1
with	1
composure	1
to	1
become	1
a	1
standing	1
joke	1
with	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings.	1
Marianne	1
felt	1
for	1
her	1
most	1
sincerely;	1
but	1
she	1
did	1
more	1
harm	1
than	1
good	1
to	1
the	1
cause,	1
by	1
turning	1
very	1
red	1
and	1
saying	1
in	1
an	1
angry	1
manner	1
to	1
Margaret,	1
"Remember	1
that	1
whatever	1
your	1
conjectures	1
may	1
be,	1
you	1
have	1
no	1
right	1
to	1
repeat	1
them."	1
"I	1
never	1
had	1
any	1
conjectures	1
about	1
it,"	1
replied	1
Margaret;	1
"it	1
was	1
you	1
who	1
told	1
me	1
of	1
it	1
yourself."	1
This	1
increased	1
the	1
mirth	1
of	1
the	1
company,	1
and	1
Margaret	1
was	1
eagerly	1
pressed	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
more.	1
"Oh!	1
pray,	1
Miss	1
Margaret,	1
let	1
us	1
know	1
all	1
about	1
it,"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings.	1
"What	1
is	1
the	1
gentleman's	1
name?"	1
"I	1
must	1
not	1
tell,	1
ma'am.	1
But	1
I	1
know	1
very	1
well	1
what	1
it	1
is;	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
where	1
he	1
is	1
too."	1
"Yes,	1
yes,	1
we	1
can	1
guess	1
where	1
he	1
is;	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
house	1
at	1
Norland	1
to	1
be	1
sure.	1
He	1
is	1
the	1
curate	1
of	1
the	1
parish	1
I	1
dare	1
say."	1
"No,	1
THAT	1
he	1
is	1
not.	1
He	1
is	1
of	1
no	1
profession	1
at	1
all."	1
"Margaret,"	1
said	1
Marianne	1
with	1
great	1
warmth,	1
"you	1
know	1
that	1
all	1
this	1
is	1
an	1
invention	1
of	1
your	1
own,	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
such	1
person	1
in	1
existence."	1
"Well,	1
then,	1
he	1
is	1
lately	1
dead,	1
Marianne,	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
there	1
was	1
such	1
a	1
man	1
once,	1
and	1
his	1
name	1
begins	1
with	1
an	1
F."	1
Most	1
grateful	1
did	1
Elinor	1
feel	1
to	1
Lady	1
Middleton	1
for	1
observing,	1
at	1
this	1
moment,	1
"that	1
it	1
rained	1
very	1
hard,"	1
though	1
she	1
believed	1
the	1
interruption	1
to	1
proceed	1
less	1
from	1
any	1
attention	1
to	1
her,	1
than	1
from	1
her	1
ladyship's	1
great	1
dislike	1
of	1
all	1
such	1
inelegant	1
subjects	1
of	1
raillery	1
as	1
delighted	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
mother.	1
The	1
idea	1
however	1
started	1
by	1
her,	1
was	1
immediately	1
pursued	1
by	1
Colonel	1
Brandon,	1
who	1
was	1
on	1
every	1
occasion	1
mindful	1
of	1
the	1
feelings	1
of	1
others;	1
and	1
much	1
was	1
said	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
rain	1
by	1
both	1
of	1
them.	1
Willoughby	1
opened	1
the	1
piano-forte,	1
and	1
asked	1
Marianne	1
to	1
sit	1
down	1
to	1
it;	1
and	1
thus	1
amidst	1
the	1
various	1
endeavours	1
of	1
different	1
people	1
to	1
quit	1
the	1
topic,	1
it	1
fell	1
to	1
the	1
ground.	1
But	1
not	1
so	1
easily	1
did	1
Elinor	1
recover	1
from	1
the	1
alarm	1
into	1
which	1
it	1
had	1
thrown	1
her.	1
A	1
party	1
was	1
formed	1
this	1
evening	1
for	1
going	1
on	1
the	1
following	1
day	1
to	1
see	1
a	1
very	1
fine	1
place	1
about	1
twelve	1
miles	1
from	1
Barton,	1
belonging	1
to	1
a	1
brother-in-law	1
of	1
Colonel	1
Brandon,	1
without	1
whose	1
interest	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
seen,	1
as	1
the	1
proprietor,	1
who	1
was	1
then	1
abroad,	1
had	1
left	1
strict	1
orders	1
on	1
that	1
head.	1
The	1
grounds	1
were	1
declared	1
to	1
be	1
highly	1
beautiful,	1
and	1
Sir	1
John,	1
who	1
was	1
particularly	1
warm	1
in	1
their	1
praise,	1
might	1
be	1
allowed	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
tolerable	1
judge,	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
formed	1
parties	1
to	1
visit	1
them,	1
at	1
least,	1
twice	1
every	1
summer	1
for	1
the	1
last	1
ten	1
years.	1
They	1
contained	1
a	1
noble	1
piece	1
of	1
water;	1
a	1
sail	1
on	1
which	1
was	1
to	1
a	1
form	1
a	1
great	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
morning's	1
amusement;	1
cold	1
provisions	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
taken,	1
open	1
carriages	1
only	1
to	1
be	1
employed,	1
and	1
every	1
thing	1
conducted	1
in	1
the	1
usual	1
style	1
of	1
a	1
complete	1
party	1
of	1
pleasure.	1
To	1
some	1
few	1
of	1
the	1
company	1
it	1
appeared	1
rather	1
a	1
bold	1
undertaking,	1
considering	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
year,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
had	1
rained	1
every	1
day	1
for	1
the	1
last	1
fortnight;--	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood,	1
who	1
had	1
already	1
a	1
cold,	1
was	1
persuaded	1
by	1
Elinor	1
to	1
stay	1

home.	1
CHAPTER	1
13	1
Their	1
intended	1
excursion	1
to	1
Whitwell	1
turned	1
out	1
very	1
different	1
from	1
what	1
Elinor	1
had	1
expected.	1
She	1
was	1
prepared	1
to	1
be	1
wet	1
through,	1
fatigued,	1
and	1
frightened;	1
but	1
the	1
event	1
was	1
still	1
more	1
unfortunate,	1
for	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
at	1
all.	1
By	1
ten	1
o'clock	1
the	1
whole	1
party	1
was	1
assembled	1
at	1
the	1
park,	1
where	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
breakfast.	1
The	1
morning	1
was	1
rather	1
favourable,	1
though	1
it	1
had	1
rained	1
all	1
night,	1
as	1
the	1
clouds	1
were	1
then	1
dispersing	1
across	1
the	1
sky,	1
and	1
the	1
sun	1
frequently	1
appeared.	1
They	1
were	1
all	1
in	1
high	1
spirits	1
and	1
good	1
humour,	1
eager	1
to	1
be	1
happy,	1
and	1
determined	1
to	1
submit	1
to	1
the	1
greatest	1
inconveniences	1
and	1
hardships	1
rather	1
than	1
be	1
otherwise.	1
While	1
they	1
were	1
at	1
breakfast	1
the	1
letters	1
were	1
brought	1
in.	1
Among	1
the	1
rest	1
there	1
was	1
one	1
for	1
Colonel	1
Brandon;--he	1
took	1
it,	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
direction,	1
changed	1
colour,	1
and	1
immediately	1
left	1
the	1
room.	1
"What	1
is	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
Brandon?"	1
said	1
Sir	1
John.	1
Nobody	1
could	1
tell.	1
"I	1
hope	1
he	1
has	1
had	1
no	1
bad	1
news,"	1
said	1
Lady	1
Middleton.	1
"It	1
must	1
be	1
something	1
extraordinary	1
that	1
could	1
make	1
Colonel	1
Brandon	1
leave	1
my	1
breakfast	1
table	1
so	1
suddenly."	1
In	1
about	1
five	1
minutes	1
he	1
returned.	1
"No	1
bad	1
news,	1
Colonel,	1
I	1
hope;"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
entered	1
the	1
room.	1
"None	1
at	1
all,	1
ma'am,	1
I	1
thank	1
you."	1
"Was	1
it	1
from	1
Avignon?	1
I	1
hope	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
your	1
sister	1
is	1
worse."	1
"No,	1
ma'am.	1
It	1
came	1
from	1
town,	1
and	1
is	1
merely	1
a	1
letter	1
of	1
business."	1
"But	1
how	1
came	1
the	1
hand	1
to	1
discompose	1
you	1
so	1
much,	1
if	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
a	1
letter	1
of	1
business?	1
Come,	1
come,	1
this	1
won't	1
do,	1
Colonel;	1
so	1
let	1
us	1
hear	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
it."	1
"My	1
dear	1
madam,"	1
said	1
Lady	1
Middleton,	1
"recollect	1
what	1
you	1
are	1
saying."	1
"Perhaps	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
your	1
cousin	1
Fanny	1
is	1
married?"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings,	1
without	1
attending	1
to	1
her	1
daughter's	1
reproof.	1
"No,	1
indeed,	1
it	1
is	1
not."	1
"Well,	1
then,	1
I	1
know	1
who	1
it	1
is	1
from,	1
Colonel.	1
And	1
I	1
hope	1
she	1
is	1
well."	1
"Whom	1
do	1
you	1
mean,	1
ma'am?"	1
said	1
he,	1
colouring	1
a	1
little.	1
"Oh!	1
you	1
know	1
who	1
I	1
mean."	1
"I	1
am	1
particularly	1
sorry,	1
ma'am,"	1
said	1
he,	1
addressing	1
Lady	1
Middleton,	1
"that	1
I	1
should	1
receive	1
this	1
letter	1
today,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
on	1
business	1
which	1
requires	1
my	1
immediate	1
attendance	1
in	1
town."	1
"In	1
town!"	1
cried	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings.	1
"What	1
can	1
you	1
have	1
to	1
do	1
in	1
town	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
of	1
year?"	1
"My	1
own	1
loss	1
is	1
great,"	1
be	1
continued,	1
"in	1
being	1
obliged	1
to	1
leave	1
so	1
agreeable	1
a	1
party;	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
more	1
concerned,	1
as	1
I	1
fear	1
my	1
presence	1
is	1
necessary	1
to	1
gain	1
your	1
admittance	1
at	1
Whitwell."	1
What	1
a	1
blow	1
upon	1
them	1
all	1
was	1
this!	1
"But	1
if	1
you	1
write	1
a	1
note	1
to	1
the	1
housekeeper,	1
Mr.	1
Brandon,"	1
said	1
Marianne,	1
eagerly,	1
"will	1
it	1
not	1
be	1
sufficient?"	1
He	1
shook	1
his	1
head.	1
"We	1
must	1
go,"	1
said	1
Sir	1
John.--"It	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
put	1
off	1
when	1
we	1
are	1
so	1
near	1
it.	1
You	1
cannot	1
go	1
to	1
town	1
till	1
tomorrow,	1
Brandon,	1
that	1
is	1
all."	1
"I	1
wish	1
it	1
could	1
be	1
so	1
easily	1
settled.	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
my	1
power	1
to	1
delay	1
my	1
journey	1
for	1
one	1
day!"	1
"If	1
you	1
would	1
but	1
let	1
us	1
know	1
what	1
your	1
business	1
is,"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings,	1
"we	1
might	1
see	1
whether	1
it	1
could	1
be	1
put	1
off	1
or	1
not."	1
"You	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
six	1
hours	1
later,"	1
said	1
Willoughby,	1
"if	1
you	1
were	1
to	1
defer	1
your	1
journey	1
till	1
our	1
return."	1
"I	1
cannot	1
afford	1
to	1
lose	1
ONE	1
hour."--	1
Elinor	1
then	1
heard	1
Willoughby	1
say,	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice	1
to	1
Marianne,	1
"There	1
are	1
some	1
people	1
who	1
cannot	1
bear	1
a	1
party	1
of	1
pleasure.	1
Brandon	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
them.	1
He	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
catching	1
cold	1
I	1
dare	1
say,	1
and	1
invented	1
this	1
trick	1
for	1
getting	1
out	1
of	1
it.	1
I	1
would	1
lay	1
fifty	1
guineas	1
the	1
letter	1
was	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
writing."	1
"I	1
have	1
no	1
doubt	1
of	1
it,"	1
replied	1
Marianne.	1
"There	1
is	1
no	1
persuading	1
you	1
to	1
change	1
your	1
mind,	1
Brandon,	1
I	1
know	1
of	1
old,"	1
said	1
Sir	1
John,	1
"when	1
once	1
you	1
are	1
determined	1
on	1
anything.	1
But,	1
however,	1
I	1
hope	1
you	1
will	1
think	1
better	1
of	1
it.	1
Consider,	1
here	1
are	1
the	1
two	1
Miss	1
Careys	1
come	1
over	1
from	1
Newton,	1
the	1
three	1
Miss	1
Dashwoods	1
walked	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
cottage,	1
and	1
Mr.	1
Willoughby	1
got	1
up	1
two	1
hours	1
before	1
his	1
usual	1
time,	1
on	1
purpose	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
Whitwell."	1
Colonel	1
Brandon	1
again	1
repeated	1
his	1
sorrow	1
at	1
being	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
disappointing	1
the	1
party;	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
declared	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
unavoidable.	1
"Well,	1
then,	1
when	1
will	1
you	1
come	1
back	1
again?"	1
"I	1
hope	1
we	1
shall	1
see	1
you	1
at	1
Barton,"	1
added	1
her	1
ladyship,	1
"as	1
soon	1
as	1
you	1
can	1
conveniently	1
leave	1
town;	1
and	1
we	1
must	1
put	1
off	1
the	1
party	1
to	1
Whitwell	1
till	1
you	1
return."	1
"You	1
are	1
very	1
obliging.	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
so	1
uncertain,	1
when	1
I	1
may	1
have	1
it	1
in	1
my	1
power	1
to	1
return,	1
that	1
I	1
dare	1
not	1
engage	1
for	1
it	1
at	1
all."	1
"Oh!	1
he	1
must	1
and	1
shall	1
come	1
back,"	1
cried	1
Sir	1
John.	1
"If	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
here	1
by	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
week,	1
I	1
shall	1
go	1
after	1
him."	1
"Ay,	1
so	1
do,	1
Sir	1
John,"	1
cried	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings,	1
"and	1
then	1
perhaps	1
you	1
may	1
find	1
out	1
what	1
his	1
business	1
is."	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
pry	1
into	1
other	1
men's	1
concerns.	1
I	1
suppose	1
it	1
is	1
something	1
he	1
is	1
ashamed	1
of."	1
Colonel	1
Brandon's	1
horses	1
were	1
announced.	1
"You	1
do	1
not	1
go	1
to	1
town	1
on	1
horseback,	1
do	1
you?"	1
added	1
Sir	1
John.	1
"No.	1
Only	1
to	1
Honiton.	1
I	1
shall	1
then	1
go	1
post."	1
"Well,	1
as	1
you	1
are	1
resolved	1
to	1
go,	1
I	1
wish	1
you	1
a	1
good	1
journey.	1
But	1
you	1
had	1
better	1
change	1
your	1
mind."	1
"I	1
assure	1
you	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
my	1
power."	1
He	1
then	1
took	1
leave	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
party.	1
"Is	1
there	1
no	1
chance	1
of	1
my	1
seeing	1
you	1
and	1
your	1
sisters	1
in	1
town	1
this	1
winter,	1
Miss	1
Dashwood?"	1
"I	1
am	1
afraid,	1
none	1
at	1
all."	1
"Then	1
I	1
must	1
bid	1
you	1
farewell	1
for	1
a	1
longer	1
time	1
than	1
I	1
should	1
wish	1
to	1
do."	1
To	1
Marianne,	1
he	1
merely	1
bowed	1
and	1
said	1
nothing.	1
"Come	1
Colonel,"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings,	1
"before	1
you	1
go,	1
do	1
let	1
us	1
know	1
what	1
you	1
are	1
going	1
about."	1
He	1
wished	1
her	1
a	1
good	1
morning,	1
and,	1
attended	1
by	1
Sir	1
John,	1
left	1
the	1
room.	1
The	1
complaints	1
and	1
lamentations	1
which	1
politeness	1
had	1
hitherto	1
restrained,	1
now	1
burst	1
forth	1
universally;	1
and	1
they	1
all	1
agreed	1
again	1
and	1
again	1
how	1
provoking	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
disappointed.	1
"I	1
can	1
guess	1
what	1
his	1
business	1
is,	1
however,"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
exultingly.	1
"Can	1
you,	1
ma'am?"	1
said	1
almost	1
every	1
body.	1
"Yes;	1
it	1
is	1
about	1
Miss	1
Williams,	1
I	1
am	1
sure."	1
"And	1
who	1
is	1
Miss	1
Williams?"	1
asked	1
Marianne.	1
"What!	1
do	1
not	1
you	1
know	1
who	1
Miss	1
Williams	1
is?	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
you	1
must	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
her	1
before.	1
She	1
is	1
a	1
relation	1
of	1
the	1
Colonel's,	1
my	1
dear;	1
a	1
very	1
near	1
relation.	1
We	1
will	1
not	1
say	1
how	1
near,	1
for	1
fear	1
of	1
shocking	1
the	1
young	1
ladies."	1
Then,	1
lowering	1
her	1
voice	1
a	1
little,	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
Elinor,	1
"She	1
is	1
his	1
natural	1
daughter."	1
"Indeed!"	1
"Oh,	1
yes;	1
and	1
as	1
like	1
him	1
as	1
she	1
can	1
stare.	1
I	1
dare	1
say	1
the	1
Colonel	1
will	1
leave	1
her	1
all	1
his	1
fortune."	1
When	1
Sir	1
John	1
returned,	1
he	1
joined	1
most	1
heartily	1
in	1
the	1
general	1
regret	1
on	1
so	1
unfortunate	1
an	1
event;	1
concluding	1
however	1
by	1
observing,	1
that	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
got	1
together,	1
they	1
must	1
do	1
something	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
being	1
happy;	1
and	1
after	1
some	1
consultation	1
it	1
was	1
agreed,	1
that	1
although	1
happiness	1
could	1
only	1
be	1
enjoyed	1
at	1
Whitwell,	1
they	1
might	1
procure	1
a	1
tolerable	1
composure	1
of	1
mind	1
by	1
driving	1
about	1
the	1
country.	1
The	1
carriages	1
were	1
then	1
ordered;	1
Willoughby's	1
was	1
first,	1
and	1
Marianne	1
never	1
looked	1
happier	1
than	1
when	1
she	1
got	1
into	1
it.	1
He	1
drove	1
through	1
the	1
park	1
very	1
fast,	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
soon	1
out	1
of	1
sight;	1
and	1
nothing	1
more	1
of	1
them	1
was	1
seen	1
till	1
their	1
return,	1
which	1
did	1
not	1
happen	1
till	1
after	1
the	1
return	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
rest.	1
They	1
both	1
seemed	1
delighted	1
with	1
their	1
drive;	1
but	1
said	1
only	1
in	1
general	1
terms	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
kept	1
in	1
the	1
lanes,	1
while	1
the	1
others	1
went	1
on	1
the	1
downs.	1
It	1
was	1
settled	1
that	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
a	1
dance	1
in	1
the	1
evening,	1
and	1
that	1
every	1
body	1
should	1
be	1
extremely	1
merry	1
all	1
day	1
long.	1
Some	1
more	1
of	1
the	1
Careys	1
came	1
to	1
dinner,	1
and	1
they	1
had	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
sitting	1
down	1
nearly	1
twenty	1
to	1
table,	1
which	1
Sir	1
John	1
observed	1
with	1
great	1
contentment.	1
Willoughby	1
took	1
his	1
usual	1
place	1
between	1
the	1
two	1
elder	1
Miss	1
Dashwoods.	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
sat	1
on	1
Elinor's	1
right	1
hand;	1
and	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
long	1
seated,	1
before	1
she	1
leant	1
behind	1
her	1
and	1
Willoughby,	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
Marianne,	1
loud	1
enough	1
for	1
them	1
both	1
to	1
hear,	1
"I	1
have	1
found	1
you	1
out	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
your	1
tricks.	1
I	1
know	1
where	1
you	1
spent	1
the	1
morning."	1
Marianne	1
coloured,	1
and	1
replied	1
very	1
hastily,	1
"Where,	1
pray?"--	1
"Did	1
not	1
you	1
know,"	1
said	1
Willoughby,	1
"that	1
we	1
had	1
been	1
out	1
in	1
my	1
curricle?"	1
"Yes,	1
yes,	1
Mr.	1
Impudence,	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
very	1
well,	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
determined	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
WHERE	1
you	1
had	1
been	1
to.--	1
I	1
hope	1
you	1
like	1
your	1
house,	1
Miss	1
Marianne.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
large	1
one,	1
I	1
know;	1
and	1
when	1
I	1
come	1
to	1
see	1
you,	1
I	1
hope	1
you	1
will	1
have	1
new-furnished	1
it,	1
for	1
it	1
wanted	1
it	1
very	1
much	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
there	1
six	1
years	1
ago."	1
Marianne	1
turned	1
away	1
in	1
great	1
confusion.	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
laughed	1
heartily;	1
and	1
Elinor	1
found	1
that	1
in	1
her	1
resolution	1
to	1
know	1
where	1
they	1
had	1
been,	1
she	1
had	1
actually	1
made	1
her	1
own	1
woman	1
enquire	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Willoughby's	1
groom;	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
by	1
that	1
method	1
been	1
informed	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
Allenham,	1
and	1
spent	1
a	1
considerable	1
time	1
there	1
in	1
walking	1
about	1
the	1
garden	1
and	1
going	1
all	1
over	1
the	1
house.	1
Elinor	1
could	1
hardly	1
believe	1
this	1
to	1
be	1
true,	1
as	1
it	1
seemed	1
very	1
unlikely	1
that	1
Willoughby	1
should	1
propose,	1
or	1
Marianne	1
consent,	1
to	1
enter	1
the	1
house	1
while	1
Mrs.	1
Smith	1
was	1
in	1
it,	1
with	1
whom	1
Marianne	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
smallest	1
acquaintance.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
left	1
the	1
dining-room,	1
Elinor	1
enquired	1
of	1
her	1
about	1
it;	1
and	1
great	1
was	1
her	1
surprise	1
when	1
she	1
found	1
that	1
every	1
circumstance	1
related	1
by	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
was	1
perfectly	1
true.	1
Marianne	1
was	1
quite	1
angry	1
with	1
her	1
for	1
doubting	1
it.	1
"Why	1
should	1
you	1
imagine,	1
Elinor,	1
that	1
we	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
there,	1
or	1
that	1
we	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
the	1
house?	1
Is	1
not	1
it	1
what	1
you	1
have	1
often	1
wished	1
to	1
do	1
yourself?"	1
"Yes,	1
Marianne,	1
but	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
go	1
while	1
Mrs.	1
Smith	1
was	1
there,	1
and	1
with	1
no	1
other	1
companion	1
than	1
Mr.	1
Willoughby."	1
"Mr.	1
Willoughby	1
however	1
is	1
the	1
only	1
person	1
who	1
can	1
have	1
a	1
right	1
to	1
shew	1
that	1
house;	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
in	1
an	1
open	1
carriage,	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
have	1
any	1
other	1
companion.	1
I	1
never	1
spent	1
a	1
pleasanter	1
morning	1
in	1
my	1
life."	1
"I	1
am	1
afraid,"	1
replied	1
Elinor,	1
"that	1
the	1
pleasantness	1
of	1
an	1
employment	1
does	1
not	1
always	1
evince	1
its	1
propriety."	1
"On	1
the	1
contrary,	1
nothing	1
can	1
be	1
a	1
stronger	1
proof	1
of	1
it,	1
Elinor;	1
for	1
if	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
any	1
real	1
impropriety	1
in	1
what	1
I	1
did,	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
sensible	1
of	1
it	1
at	1
the	1
time,	1
for	1
we	1
always	1
know	1
when	1
we	1
are	1
acting	1
wrong,	1
and	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
conviction	1
I	1
could	1
have	1
had	1
no	1
pleasure."	1
"But,	1
my	1
dear	1
Marianne,	1
as	1
it	1
has	1
already	1
exposed	1
you	1
to	1
some	1
very	1
impertinent	1
remarks,	1
do	1
you	1
not	1
now	1
begin	1
to	1
doubt	1
the	1
discretion	1
of	1
your	1
own	1
conduct?"	1
"If	1
the	1
impertinent	1
remarks	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
proof	1
of	1
impropriety	1
in	1
conduct,	1
we	1
are	1
all	1
offending	1
every	1
moment	1
of	1
our	1
lives.	1
I	1
value	1
not	1
her	1
censure	1
any	1
more	1
than	1
I	1
should	1
do	1
her	1
commendation.	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
sensible	1
of	1
having	1
done	1
anything	1
wrong	1
in	1
walking	1
over	1
Mrs.	1
Smith's	1
grounds,	1
or	1
in	1
seeing	1
her	1
house.	1
They	1
will	1
one	1
day	1
be	1
Mr.	1
Willoughby's,	1
and--"	1
"If	1
they	1
were	1
one	1
day	1
to	1
be	1
your	1
own,	1
Marianne,	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
justified	1
in	1
what	1
you	1
have	1
done."	1
She	1
blushed	1
at	1
this	1
hint;	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
even	1
visibly	1
gratifying	1
to	1
her;	1
and	1
after	1
a	1
ten	1
minutes'	1
interval	1
of	1
earnest	1
thought,	1
she	1
came	1
to	1
her	1
sister	1
again,	1
and	1
said	1
with	1
great	1
good	1
humour,	1
"Perhaps,	1
Elinor,	1
it	1
WAS	1
rather	1
ill-judged	1
in	1
me	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
Allenham;	1
but	1
Mr.	1
Willoughby	1
wanted	1
particularly	1
to	1
shew	1
me	1
the	1
place;	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
charming	1
house,	1
I	1
assure	1
you.--There	1
is	1
one	1
remarkably	1
pretty	1
sitting	1
room	1
up	1
stairs;	1
of	1
a	1
nice	1
comfortable	1
size	1
for	1
constant	1
use,	1
and	1
with	1
modern	1
furniture	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
delightful.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
corner	1
room,	1
and	1
has	1
windows	1
on	1
two	1
sides.	1
On	1
one	1
side	1
you	1
look	1
across	1
the	1
bowling-green,	1
behind	1
the	1
house,	1
to	1
a	1
beautiful	1
hanging	1
wood,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
you	1
have	1
a	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
and	1
village,	1
and,	1
beyond	1
them,	1
of	1
those	1
fine	1
bold	1
hills	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
so	1
often	1
admired.	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
it	1
to	1
advantage,	1
for	1
nothing	1
could	1
be	1
more	1
forlorn	1
than	1
the	1
furniture,--but	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
newly	1
fitted	1
up--a	1
couple	1
of	1
hundred	1
pounds,	1
Willoughby	1
says,	1
would	1
make	1
it	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
pleasantest	1
summer-rooms	1
in	1
England."	1
Could	1
Elinor	1
have	1
listened	1
to	1
her	1
without	1
interruption	1
from	1
the	1
others,	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
described	1
every	1
room	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
with	1
equal	1
delight.	1
CHAPTER	1
14	1
The	1
sudden	1
termination	1
of	1
Colonel	1
Brandon's	1
visit	1
at	1
the	1
park,	1
with	1
his	1
steadiness	1
in	1
concealing	1
its	1
cause,	1
filled	1
the	1
mind,	1
and	1
raised	1
the	1
wonder	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
for	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
days;	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
wonderer,	1
as	1
every	1
one	1
must	1
be	1
who	1
takes	1
a	1
very	1
lively	1
interest	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
comings	1
and	1
goings	1
of	1
all	1
their	1
acquaintance.	1
She	1
wondered,	1
with	1
little	1
intermission	1
what	1
could	1
be	1
the	1
reason	1
of	1
it;	1
was	1
sure	1
there	1
must	1
be	1
some	1
bad	1
news,	1
and	1
thought	1
over	1
every	1
kind	1
of	1
distress	1
that	1
could	1
have	1
befallen	1
him,	1
with	1
a	1
fixed	1
determination	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
not	1
escape	1
them	1
all.	1
"Something	1
very	1
melancholy	1
must	1
be	1
the	1
matter,	1
I	1
am	1
sure,"	1
said	1
she.	1
"I	1
could	1
see	1
it	1
in	1
his	1
face.	1
Poor	1
man!	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
his	1
circumstances	1
may	1
be	1
bad.	1
The	1
estate	1
at	1
Delaford	1
was	1
never	1
reckoned	1
more	1
than	1
two	1
thousand	1
a	1
year,	1
and	1
his	1
brother	1
left	1
everything	1
sadly	1
involved.	1
I	1
do	1
think	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
sent	1
for	1
about	1
money	1
matters,	1
for	1
what	1
else	1
can	1
it	1
be?	1
I	1
wonder	1
whether	1
it	1
is	1
so.	1
I	1
would	1
give	1
anything	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
it.	1
Perhaps	1
it	1
is	1
about	1
Miss	1
Williams	1
and,	1
by	1
the	1
bye,	1
I	1
dare	1
say	1
it	1
is,	1
because	1
he	1
looked	1
so	1
conscious	1
when	1
I	1
mentioned	1
her.	1
May	1
be	1
she	1
is	1
ill	1
in	1
town;	1
nothing	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
more	1
likely,	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
notion	1
she	1
is	1
always	1
rather	1
sickly.	1
I	1
would	1
lay	1
any	1
wager	1
it	1
is	1
about	1
Miss	1
Williams.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
so	1
very	1
likely	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
distressed	1
in	1
his	1
circumstances	1
NOW,	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
prudent	1
man,	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
sure	1
must	1
have	1
cleared	1
the	1
estate	1
by	1
this	1
time.	1
I	1
wonder	1
what	1
it	1
can	1
be!	1
May	1
be	1
his	1
sister	1
is	1
worse	1
at	1
Avignon,	1
and	1
has	1
sent	1
for	1
him	1
over.	1
His	1
setting	1
off	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
hurry	1
seems	1
very	1
like	1
it.	1
Well,	1
I	1
wish	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
trouble	1
with	1
all	1
my	1
heart,	1
and	1
a	1
good	1
wife	1
into	1
the	1
bargain."	1
So	1
wondered,	1
so	1
talked	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings.	1
Her	1
opinion	1
varying	1
with	1
every	1
fresh	1
conjecture,	1
and	1
all	1
seeming	1
equally	1
probable	1
as	1
they	1
arose.	1
Elinor,	1
though	1
she	1
felt	1
really	1
interested	1
in	1
the	1
welfare	1
of	1
Colonel	1
Brandon,	1
could	1
not	1
bestow	1
all	1
the	1
wonder	1
on	1
his	1
going	1
so	1
suddenly	1
away,	1
which	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
was	1
desirous	1
of	1
her	1
feeling;	1
for	1
besides	1
that	1
the	1
circumstance	1
did	1
not	1
in	1
her	1
opinion	1
justify	1
such	1
lasting	1
amazement	1
or	1
variety	1
of	1
speculation,	1
her	1
wonder	1
was	1
otherwise	1
disposed	1
of.	1
It	1
was	1
engrossed	1
by	1
the	1
extraordinary	1
silence	1
of	1
her	1
sister	1
and	1
Willoughby	1
on	1
the	1
subject,	1
which	1
they	1
must	1
know	1
to	1
be	1
peculiarly	1
interesting	1
to	1
them	1
all.	1
As	1
this	1
silence	1
continued,	1
every	1
day	1
made	1
it	1
appear	1
more	1
strange	1
and	1
more	1
incompatible	1
with	1
the	1
disposition	1
of	1
both.	1
Why	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
openly	1
acknowledge	1
to	1
her	1
mother	1
and	1
herself,	1
what	1
their	1
constant	1
behaviour	1
to	1
each	1
other	1
declared	1
to	1
have	1
taken	1
place,	1
Elinor	1
could	1
not	1
imagine.	1
She	1
could	1
easily	1
conceive	1
that	1
marriage	1
might	1
not	1
be	1
immediately	1
in	1
their	1
power;	1
for	1
though	1
Willoughby	1
was	1
independent,	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
reason	1
to	1
believe	1
him	1
rich.	1
His	1
estate	1
had	1
been	1
rated	1
by	1
Sir	1
John	1
at	1
about	1
six	1
or	1
seven	1
hundred	1
a	1
year;	1
but	1
he	1
lived	1
at	1
an	1
expense	1
to	1
which	1
that	1
income	1
could	1
hardly	1
be	1
equal,	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
himself	1
often	1
complained	1
of	1
his	1
poverty.	1
But	1
for	1
this	1
strange	1
kind	1
of	1
secrecy	1
maintained	1
by	1
them	1
relative	1
to	1
their	1
engagement,	1
which	1
in	1
fact	1
concealed	1
nothing	1
at	1
all,	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
account;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
wholly	1
contradictory	1
to	1
their	1
general	1
opinions	1
and	1
practice,	1
that	1
a	1
doubt	1
sometimes	1
entered	1
her	1
mind	1
of	1
their	1
being	1
really	1
engaged,	1
and	1
this	1
doubt	1
was	1
enough	1
to	1
prevent	1
her	1
making	1
any	1
inquiry	1
of	1
Marianne.	1
Nothing	1
could	1
be	1
more	1
expressive	1
of	1
attachment	1
to	1
them	1
all,	1
than	1
Willoughby's	1
behaviour.	1
To	1
Marianne	1
it	1
had	1
all	1
the	1
distinguishing	1
tenderness	1
which	1
a	1
lover's	1
heart	1
could	1
give,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
affectionate	1
attention	1
of	1
a	1
son	1
and	1
a	1
brother.	1
The	1
cottage	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
considered	1
and	1
loved	1
by	1
him	1
as	1
his	1
home;	1
many	1
more	1
of	1
his	1
hours	1
were	1
spent	1
there	1
than	1
at	1
Allenham;	1
and	1
if	1
no	1
general	1
engagement	1
collected	1
them	1
at	1
the	1
park,	1
the	1
exercise	1
which	1
called	1
him	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
was	1
almost	1
certain	1
of	1
ending	1
there,	1
where	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
was	1
spent	1
by	1
himself	1
at	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
Marianne,	1
and	1
by	1
his	1
favourite	1
pointer	1
at	1
her	1
feet.	1
One	1
evening	1
in	1
particular,	1
about	1
a	1
week	1
after	1
Colonel	1
Brandon	1
left	1
the	1
country,	1
his	1
heart	1
seemed	1
more	1
than	1
usually	1
open	1
to	1
every	1
feeling	1
of	1
attachment	1
to	1
the	1
objects	1
around	1
him;	1
and	1
on	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood's	1
happening	1
to	1
mention	1
her	1
design	1
of	1
improving	1
the	1
cottage	1
in	1
the	1
spring,	1
he	1
warmly	1
opposed	1
every	1
alteration	1
of	1
a	1
place	1
which	1
affection	1
had	1
established	1
as	1
perfect	1
with	1
him.	1
"What!"	1
he	1
exclaimed--"Improve	1
this	1
dear	1
cottage!	1
No.	1
THAT	1
I	1
will	1
never	1
consent	1
to.	1
Not	1
a	1
stone	1
must	1
be	1
added	1
to	1
its	1
walls,	1
not	1
an	1
inch	1
to	1
its	1
size,	1
if	1
my	1
feelings	1
are	1
regarded."	1
"Do	1
not	1
be	1
alarmed,"	1
said	1
Miss	1
Dashwood,	1
"nothing	1
of	1
the	1
kind	1
will	1
be	1
done;	1
for	1
my	1
mother	1
will	1
never	1
have	1
money	1
enough	1
to	1
attempt	1
it."	1
"I	1
am	1
heartily	1
glad	1
of	1
it,"	1
he	1
cried.	1
"May	1
she	1
always	1
be	1
poor,	1
if	1
she	1
can	1
employ	1
her	1
riches	1
no	1
better."	1
"Thank	1
you,	1
Willoughby.	1
But	1
you	1
may	1
be	1
assured	1
that	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
sacrifice	1
one	1
sentiment	1
of	1
local	1
attachment	1
of	1
yours,	1
or	1
of	1
any	1
one	1
whom	1
I	1
loved,	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
improvements	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
Depend	1
upon	1
it	1
that	1
whatever	1
unemployed	1
sum	1
may	1
remain,	1
when	1
I	1
make	1
up	1
my	1
accounts	1
in	1
the	1
spring,	1
I	1
would	1
even	1
rather	1
lay	1
it	1
uselessly	1
by	1
than	1
dispose	1
of	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
manner	1
so	1
painful	1
to	1
you.	1
But	1
are	1
you	1
really	1
so	1
attached	1
to	1
this	1
place	1
as	1
to	1
see	1
no	1
defect	1
in	1
it?"	1
"I	1
am,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"To	1
me	1
it	1
is	1
faultless.	1
Nay,	1
more,	1
I	1
consider	1
it	1
as	1
the	1
only	1
form	1
of	1
building	1
in	1
which	1
happiness	1
is	1
attainable,	1
and	1
were	1
I	1
rich	1
enough	1
I	1
would	1
instantly	1
pull	1
Combe	1
down,	1
and	1
build	1
it	1
up	1
again	1
in	1
the	1
exact	1
plan	1
of	1
this	1
cottage."	1
"With	1
dark	1
narrow	1
stairs	1
and	1
a	1
kitchen	1
that	1
smokes,	1
I	1
suppose,"	1
said	1
Elinor.	1
"Yes,"	1
cried	1
he	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
eager	1
tone,	1
"with	1
all	1
and	1
every	1
thing	1
belonging	1
to	1
it;--in	1
no	1
one	1
convenience	1
or	1
INconvenience	1
about	1
it,	1
should	1
the	1
least	1
variation	1
be	1
perceptible.	1
Then,	1
and	1
then	1
only,	1
under	1
such	1
a	1
roof,	1
I	1
might	1
perhaps	1
be	1
as	1
happy	1
at	1
Combe	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
at	1
Barton."	1
"I	1
flatter	1
myself,"	1
replied	1
Elinor,	1
"that	1
even	1
under	1
the	1
disadvantage	1
of	1
better	1
rooms	1
and	1
a	1
broader	1
staircase,	1
you	1
will	1
hereafter	1
find	1
your	1
own	1
house	1
as	1
faultless	1
as	1
you	1
now	1
do	1
this."	1
"There	1
certainly	1
are	1
circumstances,"	1
said	1
Willoughby,	1
"which	1
might	1
greatly	1
endear	1
it	1
to	1
me;	1
but	1
this	1
place	1
will	1
always	1
have	1
one	1
claim	1
of	1
my	1
affection,	1
which	1
no	1
other	1
can	1
possibly	1
share."	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood	1
looked	1
with	1
pleasure	1
at	1
Marianne,	1
whose	1
fine	1
eyes	1
were	1
fixed	1
so	1
expressively	1
on	1
Willoughby,	1
as	1
plainly	1
denoted	1
how	1
well	1
she	1
understood	1
him.	1
"How	1
often	1
did	1
I	1
wish,"	1
added	1
he,	1
"when	1
I	1
was	1
at	1
Allenham	1
this	1
time	1
twelvemonth,	1
that	1
Barton	1
cottage	1
were	1
inhabited!	1
I	1
never	1
passed	1
within	1
view	1
of	1
it	1
without	1
admiring	1
its	1
situation,	1
and	1
grieving	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
should	1
live	1
in	1
it.	1
How	1
little	1
did	1
I	1
then	1
think	1
that	1
the	1
very	1
first	1
news	1
I	1
should	1
hear	1
from	1
Mrs.	1
Smith,	1
when	1
I	1
next	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
country,	1
would	1
be	1
that	1
Barton	1
cottage	1
was	1
taken:	1
and	1
I	1
felt	1
an	1
immediate	1
satisfaction	1
and	1
interest	1
in	1
the	1
event,	1
which	1
nothing	1
but	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
prescience	1
of	1
what	1
happiness	1
I	1
should	1
experience	1
from	1
it,	1
can	1
account	1
for.	1
Must	1
it	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
so,	1
Marianne?"	1
speaking	1
to	1
her	1
in	1
a	1
lowered	1
voice.	1
Then	1
continuing	1
his	1
former	1
tone,	1
he	1
said,	1
"And	1
yet	1
this	1
house	1
you	1
would	1
spoil,	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood?	1
You	1
would	1
rob	1
it	1
of	1
its	1
simplicity	1
by	1
imaginary	1
improvement!	1
and	1
this	1
dear	1
parlour	1
in	1
which	1
our	1
acquaintance	1
first	1
began,	1
and	1
in	1
which	1
so	1
many	1
happy	1
hours	1
have	1
been	1
since	1
spent	1
by	1
us	1
together,	1
you	1
would	1
degrade	1
to	1
the	1
condition	1
of	1
a	1
common	1
entrance,	1
and	1
every	1
body	1
would	1
be	1
eager	1
to	1
pass	1
through	1
the	1
room	1
which	1
has	1
hitherto	1
contained	1
within	1
itself	1
more	1
real	1
accommodation	1
and	1
comfort	1
than	1
any	1
other	1
apartment	1
of	1
the	1
handsomest	1
dimensions	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
could	1
possibly	1
afford."	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood	1
again	1
assured	1
him	1
that	1
no	1
alteration	1
of	1
the	1
kind	1
should	1
be	1
attempted.	1
"You	1
are	1
a	1
good	1
woman,"	1
he	1
warmly	1
replied.	1
"Your	1
promise	1
makes	1
me	1
easy.	1
Extend	1
it	1
a	1
little	1
farther,	1
and	1
it	1
will	1
make	1
me	1
happy.	1
Tell	1
me	1
that	1
not	1
only	1
your	1
house	1
will	1
remain	1
the	1
same,	1
but	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
ever	1
find	1
you	1
and	1
yours	1
as	1
unchanged	1
as	1
your	1
dwelling;	1
and	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
always	1
consider	1
me	1
with	1
the	1
kindness	1
which	1
has	1
made	1
everything	1
belonging	1
to	1
you	1
so	1
dear	1
to	1
me."	1
The	1
promise	1
was	1
readily	1
given,	1
and	1
Willoughby's	1
behaviour	1
during	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
the	1
evening	1
declared	1
at	1
once	1
his	1
affection	1
and	1
happiness.	1
"Shall	1
we	1
see	1
you	1
tomorrow	1
to	1
dinner?"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
leaving	1
them.	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
ask	1
you	1
to	1
come	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
for	1
we	1
must	1
walk	1
to	1
the	1
park,	1
to	1
call	1
on	1
Lady	1
Middleton."	1
He	1
engaged	1
to	1
be	1
with	1
them	1
by	1
four	1
o'clock.	1
CHAPTER	1
15	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood's	1
visit	1
to	1
Lady	1
Middleton	1
took	1
place	1
the	1
next	1
day,	1
and	1
two	1
of	1
her	1
daughters	1
went	1
with	1
her;	1
but	1
Marianne	1
excused	1
herself	1
from	1
being	1
of	1
the	1
party,	1
under	1
some	1
trifling	1
pretext	1
of	1
employment;	1
and	1
her	1
mother,	1
who	1
concluded	1
that	1
a	1
promise	1
had	1
been	1
made	1
by	1
Willoughby	1
the	1
night	1
before	1
of	1
calling	1
on	1
her	1
while	1
they	1
were	1
absent,	1
was	1
perfectly	1
satisfied	1
with	1
her	1
remaining	1
at	1
home.	1
On	1
their	1
return	1
from	1
the	1
park	1
they	1
found	1
Willoughby's	1
curricle	1
and	1
servant	1
in	1
waiting	1
at	1
the	1
cottage,	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood	1
was	1
convinced	1
that	1
her	1
conjecture	1
had	1
been	1
just.	1
So	1
far	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
foreseen;	1
but	1
on	1
entering	1
the	1
house	1
she	1
beheld	1
what	1
no	1
foresight	1
had	1
taught	1
her	1
to	1
expect.	1
They	1
were	1
no	1
sooner	1
in	1
the	1
passage	1
than	1
Marianne	1
came	1
hastily	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
parlour	1
apparently	1
in	1
violent	1
affliction,	1
with	1
her	1
handkerchief	1
at	1
her	1
eyes;	1
and	1
without	1
noticing	1
them	1
ran	1
up	1
stairs.	1
Surprised	1
and	1
alarmed	1
they	1
proceeded	1
directly	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
she	1
had	1
just	1
quitted,	1
where	1
they	1
found	1
only	1
Willoughby,	1
who	1
was	1
leaning	1
against	1
the	1
mantel-piece	1
with	1
his	1
back	1
towards	1
them.	1
He	1
turned	1
round	1
on	1
their	1
coming	1
in,	1
and	1
his	1
countenance	1
shewed	1
that	1
he	1
strongly	1
partook	1
of	1
the	1
emotion	1
which	1
over-powered	1
Marianne.	1
"Is	1
anything	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
her?"	1
cried	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood	1
as	1
she	1
entered--"is	1
she	1
ill?"	1
"I	1
hope	1
not,"	1
he	1
replied,	1
trying	1
to	1
look	1
cheerful;	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
forced	1
smile	1
presently	1
added,	1
"It	1
is	1
I	1
who	1
may	1
rather	1
expect	1
to	1
be	1
ill--for	1
I	1
am	1
now	1
suffering	1
under	1
a	1
very	1
heavy	1
disappointment!"	1
"Disappointment?"	1
"Yes,	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
unable	1
to	1
keep	1
my	1
engagement	1
with	1
you.	1
Mrs.	1
Smith	1
has	1
this	1
morning	1
exercised	1
the	1
privilege	1
of	1
riches	1
upon	1
a	1
poor	1
dependent	1
cousin,	1
by	1
sending	1
me	1
on	1
business	1
to	1
London.	1
I	1
have	1
just	1
received	1
my	1
dispatches,	1
and	1
taken	1
my	1
farewell	1
of	1
Allenham;	1
and	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
exhilaration	1
I	1
am	1
now	1
come	1
to	1
take	1
my	1
farewell	1
of	1
you."	1
"To	1
London!--and	1
are	1
you	1
going	1
this	1
morning?"	1
"Almost	1
this	1
moment."	1
"This	1
is	1
very	1
unfortunate.	1
But	1
Mrs.	1
Smith	1
must	1
be	1
obliged;--and	1
her	1
business	1
will	1
not	1
detain	1
you	1
from	1
us	1
long	1
I	1
hope."	1
He	1
coloured	1
as	1
he	1
replied,	1
"You	1
are	1
very	1
kind,	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
idea	1
of	1
returning	1
into	1
Devonshire	1
immediately.	1
My	1
visits	1
to	1
Mrs.	1
Smith	1
are	1
never	1
repeated	1
within	1
the	1
twelvemonth."	1
"And	1
is	1
Mrs.	1
Smith	1
your	1
only	1
friend?	1
Is	1
Allenham	1
the	1
only	1
house	1
in	1
the	1
neighbourhood	1
to	1
which	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
welcome?	1
For	1
shame,	1
Willoughby,	1
can	1
you	1
wait	1
for	1
an	1
invitation	1
here?"	1
His	1
colour	1
increased;	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
he	1
only	1
replied,	1
"You	1
are	1
too	1
good."	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood	1
looked	1
at	1
Elinor	1
with	1
surprise.	1
Elinor	1
felt	1
equal	1
amazement.	1
For	1
a	1
few	1
moments	1
every	1
one	1
was	1
silent.	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood	1
first	1
spoke.	1
"I	1
have	1
only	1
to	1
add,	1
my	1
dear	1
Willoughby,	1
that	1
at	1
Barton	1
cottage	1
you	1
will	1
always	1
be	1
welcome;	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
press	1
you	1
to	1
return	1
here	1
immediately,	1
because	1
you	1
only	1
can	1
judge	1
how	1
far	1
THAT	1
might	1
be	1
pleasing	1
to	1
Mrs.	1
Smith;	1
and	1
on	1
this	1
head	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
more	1
disposed	1
to	1
question	1
your	1
judgment	1
than	1
to	1
doubt	1
your	1
inclination."	1
"My	1
engagements	1
at	1
present,"	1
replied	1
Willoughby,	1
confusedly,	1
"are	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
nature--that--I	1
dare	1
not	1
flatter	1
myself"--	1
He	1
stopt.	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood	1
was	1
too	1
much	1
astonished	1
to	1
speak,	1
and	1
another	1
pause	1
succeeded.	1
This	1
was	1
broken	1
by	1
Willoughby,	1
who	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
faint	1
smile,	1
"It	1
is	1
folly	1
to	1
linger	1
in	1
this	1
manner.	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
torment	1
myself	1
any	1
longer	1
by	1
remaining	1
among	1
friends	1
whose	1
society	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
for	1
me	1
now	1
to	1
enjoy."	1
He	1
then	1
hastily	1
took	1
leave	1
of	1
them	1
all	1
and	1
left	1
the	1
room.	1
They	1
saw	1
him	1
step	1
into	1
his	1
carriage,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
minute	1
it	1
was	1
out	1
of	1
sight.	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood	1
felt	1
too	1
much	1
for	1
speech,	1
and	1
instantly	1
quitted	1
the	1
parlour	1
to	1
give	1
way	1
in	1
solitude	1
to	1
the	1
concern	1
and	1
alarm	1
which	1
this	1
sudden	1
departure	1
occasioned.	1
Elinor's	1
uneasiness	1
was	1
at	1
least	1
equal	1
to	1
her	1
mother's.	1
She	1
thought	1
of	1
what	1
had	1
just	1
passed	1
with	1
anxiety	1
and	1
distrust.	1
Willoughby's	1
behaviour	1
in	1
taking	1
leave	1
of	1
them,	1
his	1
embarrassment,	1
and	1
affectation	1
of	1
cheerfulness,	1
and,	1
above	1
all,	1
his	1
unwillingness	1
to	1
accept	1
her	1
mother's	1
invitation,	1
a	1
backwardness	1
so	1
unlike	1
a	1
lover,	1
so	1
unlike	1
himself,	1
greatly	1
disturbed	1
her.	1
One	1
moment	1
she	1
feared	1
that	1
no	1
serious	1
design	1
had	1
ever	1
been	1
formed	1
on	1
his	1
side;	1
and	1
the	1
next	1
that	1
some	1
unfortunate	1
quarrel	1
had	1
taken	1
place	1
between	1
him	1
and	1
her	1
sister;--the	1
distress	1
in	1
which	1
Marianne	1
had	1
quitted	1
the	1
room	1
was	1
such	1
as	1
a	1
serious	1
quarrel	1
could	1
most	1
reasonably	1
account	1
for,	1
though	1
when	1
she	1
considered	1
what	1
Marianne's	1
love	1
for	1
him	1
was,	1
a	1
quarrel	1
seemed	1
almost	1
impossible.	1
But	1
whatever	1
might	1
be	1
the	1
particulars	1
of	1
their	1
separation,	1
her	1
sister's	1
affliction	1
was	1
indubitable;	1
and	1
she	1
thought	1
with	1
the	1
tenderest	1
compassion	1
of	1
that	1
violent	1
sorrow	1
which	1
Marianne	1
was	1
in	1
all	1
probability	1
not	1
merely	1
giving	1
way	1
to	1
as	1
a	1
relief,	1
but	1
feeding	1
and	1
encouraging	1
as	1
a	1
duty.	1
In	1
about	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
her	1
mother	1
returned,	1
and	1
though	1
her	1
eyes	1
were	1
red,	1
her	1
countenance	1
was	1
not	1
uncheerful.	1
"Our	1
dear	1
Willoughby	1
is	1
now	1
some	1
miles	1
from	1
Barton,	1
Elinor,"	1
said	1
she,	1
as	1
she	1
sat	1
down	1
to	1
work,	1
"and	1
with	1
how	1
heavy	1
a	1
heart	1
does	1
he	1
travel?"	1
"It	1
is	1
all	1
very	1
strange.	1
So	1
suddenly	1
to	1
be	1
gone!	1
It	1
seems	1
but	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
a	1
moment.	1
And	1
last	1
night	1
he	1
was	1
with	1
us	1
so	1
happy,	1
so	1
cheerful,	1
so	1
affectionate?	1
And	1
now,	1
after	1
only	1
ten	1
minutes	1
notice--Gone	1
too	1
without	1
intending	1
to	1
return!--Something	1
more	1
than	1
what	1
be	1
owned	1
to	1
us	1
must	1
have	1
happened.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
speak,	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
behave	1
like	1
himself.	1
YOU	1
must	1
have	1
seen	1
the	1
difference	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
I.	1
What	1
can	1
it	1
be?	1
Can	1
they	1
have	1
quarrelled?	1
Why	1
else	1
should	1
he	1
have	1
shewn	1
such	1
unwillingness	1
to	1
accept	1
your	1
invitation	1
here?"--	1
"It	1
was	1
not	1
inclination	1
that	1
he	1
wanted,	1
Elinor;	1
I	1
could	1
plainly	1
see	1
THAT.	1
He	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
accepting	1
it.	1
I	1
have	1
thought	1
it	1
all	1
over	1
I	1
assure	1
you,	1
and	1
I	1
can	1
perfectly	1
account	1
for	1
every	1
thing	1
that	1
at	1
first	1
seemed	1
strange	1
to	1
me	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
to	1
you."	1
"Can	1
you,	1
indeed!"	1
"Yes.	1
I	1
have	1
explained	1
it	1
to	1
myself	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
satisfactory	1
way;--but	1
you,	1
Elinor,	1
who	1
love	1
to	1
doubt	1
where	1
you	1
can--it	1
will	1
not	1
satisfy	1
YOU,	1
I	1
know;	1
but	1
you	1
shall	1
not	1
talk	1
ME	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
trust	1
in	1
it.	1
I	1
am	1
persuaded	1
that	1
Mrs.	1
Smith	1
suspects	1
his	1
regard	1
for	1
Marianne,	1
disapproves	1
of	1
it,	1
(perhaps	1
because	1
she	1
has	1
other	1
views	1
for	1
him,)	1
and	1
on	1
that	1
account	1
is	1
eager	1
to	1
get	1
him	1
away;--	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
business	1
which	1
she	1
sends	1
him	1
off	1
to	1
transact	1
is	1
invented	1
as	1
an	1
excuse	1
to	1
dismiss	1
him.	1
This	1
is	1
what	1
I	1
believe	1
to	1
have	1
happened.	1
He	1
is,	1
moreover,	1
aware	1
that	1
she	1
DOES	1
disapprove	1
the	1
connection,	1
he	1
dares	1
not	1
therefore	1
at	1
present	1
confess	1
to	1
her	1
his	1
engagement	1
with	1
Marianne,	1
and	1
he	1
feels	1
himself	1
obliged,	1
from	1
his	1
dependent	1
situation,	1
to	1
give	1
into	1
her	1
schemes,	1
and	1
absent	1
himself	1
from	1
Devonshire	1
for	1
a	1
while.	1
You	1
will	1
tell	1
me,	1
I	1
know,	1
that	1
this	1
may	1
or	1
may	1
NOT	1
have	1
happened;	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
listen	1
to	1
no	1
cavil,	1
unless	1
you	1
can	1
point	1
out	1
any	1
other	1
method	1
of	1
understanding	1
the	1
affair	1
as	1
satisfactory	1
at	1
this.	1
And	1
now,	1
Elinor,	1
what	1
have	1
you	1
to	1
say?"	1
"Nothing,	1
for	1
you	1
have	1
anticipated	1
my	1
answer."	1
"Then	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
told	1
me,	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
or	1
might	1
not	1
have	1
happened.	1
Oh,	1
Elinor,	1
how	1
incomprehensible	1
are	1
your	1
feelings!	1
You	1
had	1
rather	1
take	1
evil	1
upon	1
credit	1
than	1
good.	1
You	1
had	1
rather	1
look	1
out	1
for	1
misery	1
for	1
Marianne,	1
and	1
guilt	1
for	1
poor	1
Willoughby,	1
than	1
an	1
apology	1
for	1
the	1
latter.	1
You	1
are	1
resolved	1
to	1
think	1
him	1
blameable,	1
because	1
he	1
took	1
leave	1
of	1
us	1
with	1
less	1
affection	1
than	1
his	1
usual	1
behaviour	1
has	1
shewn.	1
And	1
is	1
no	1
allowance	1
to	1
be	1
made	1
for	1
inadvertence,	1
or	1
for	1
spirits	1
depressed	1
by	1
recent	1
disappointment?	1
Are	1
no	1
probabilities	1
to	1
be	1
accepted,	1
merely	1
because	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
certainties?	1
Is	1
nothing	1
due	1
to	1
the	1
man	1
whom	1
we	1
have	1
all	1
such	1
reason	1
to	1
love,	1
and	1
no	1
reason	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
think	1
ill	1
of?	1
To	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
motives	1
unanswerable	1
in	1
themselves,	1
though	1
unavoidably	1
secret	1
for	1
a	1
while?	1
And,	1
after	1
all,	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
you	1
suspect	1
him	1
of?"	1
"I	1
can	1
hardly	1
tell	1
myself.	1
But	1
suspicion	1
of	1
something	1
unpleasant	1
is	1
the	1
inevitable	1
consequence	1
of	1
such	1
an	1
alteration	1
as	1
we	1
just	1
witnessed	1
in	1
him.	1
There	1
is	1
great	1
truth,	1
however,	1
in	1
what	1
you	1
have	1
now	1
urged	1
of	1
the	1
allowances	1
which	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
made	1
for	1
him,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
my	1
wish	1
to	1
be	1
candid	1
in	1
my	1
judgment	1
of	1
every	1
body.	1
Willoughby	1
may	1
undoubtedly	1
have	1
very	1
sufficient	1
reasons	1
for	1
his	1
conduct,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
hope	1
that	1
he	1
has.	1
But	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
more	1
like	1
Willoughby	1
to	1
acknowledge	1
them	1
at	1
once.	1
Secrecy	1
may	1
be	1
advisable;	1
but	1
still	1
I	1
cannot	1
help	1
wondering	1
at	1
its	1
being	1
practiced	1
by	1
him."	1
"Do	1
not	1
blame	1
him,	1
however,	1
for	1
departing	1
from	1
his	1
character,	1
where	1
the	1
deviation	1
is	1
necessary.	1
But	1
you	1
really	1
do	1
admit	1
the	1
justice	1
of	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
said	1
in	1
his	1
defence?--I	1
am	1
happy--and	1
he	1
is	1
acquitted."	1
"Not	1
entirely.	1
It	1
may	1
be	1
proper	1
to	1
conceal	1
their	1
engagement	1
(if	1
they	1
ARE	1
engaged)	1
from	1
Mrs.	1
Smith--	1
and	1
if	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
case,	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
highly	1
expedient	1
for	1
Willoughby	1
to	1
be	1
but	1
little	1
in	1
Devonshire	1
at	1
present.	1
But	1
this	1
is	1
no	1
excuse	1
for	1
their	1
concealing	1
it	1
from	1
us."	1
"Concealing	1
it	1
from	1
us!	1
my	1
dear	1
child,	1
do	1
you	1
accuse	1
Willoughby	1
and	1
Marianne	1
of	1
concealment?	1
This	1
is	1
strange	1
indeed,	1
when	1
your	1
eyes	1
have	1
been	1
reproaching	1
them	1
every	1
day	1
for	1
incautiousness."	1
"I	1
want	1
no	1
proof	1
of	1
their	1
affection,"	1
said	1
Elinor;	1
"but	1
of	1
their	1
engagement	1
I	1
do."	1
"I	1
am	1
perfectly	1
satisfied	1
of	1
both."	1
"Yet	1
not	1
a	1
syllable	1
has	1
been	1
said	1
to	1
you	1
on	1
the	1
subject,	1
by	1
either	1
of	1
them."	1
"I	1
have	1
not	1
wanted	1
syllables	1
where	1
actions	1
have	1
spoken	1
so	1
plainly.	1
Has	1
not	1
his	1
behaviour	1
to	1
Marianne	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
of	1
us,	1
for	1
at	1
least	1
the	1
last	1
fortnight,	1
declared	1
that	1
he	1
loved	1
and	1
considered	1
her	1
as	1
his	1
future	1
wife,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
felt	1
for	1
us	1
the	1
attachment	1
of	1
the	1
nearest	1
relation?	1
Have	1
we	1
not	1
perfectly	1
understood	1
each	1
other?	1
Has	1
not	1
my	1
consent	1
been	1
daily	1
asked	1
by	1
his	1
looks,	1
his	1
manner,	1
his	1
attentive	1
and	1
affectionate	1
respect?	1
My	1
Elinor,	1
is	1
it	1
possible	1
to	1
doubt	1
their	1
engagement?	1
How	1
could	1
such	1
a	1
thought	1
occur	1
to	1
you?	1
How	1
is	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
supposed	1
that	1
Willoughby,	1
persuaded	1
as	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
of	1
your	1
sister's	1
love,	1
should	1
leave	1
her,	1
and	1
leave	1
her	1
perhaps	1
for	1
months,	1
without	1
telling	1
her	1
of	1
his	1
affection;--that	1
they	1
should	1
part	1
without	1
a	1
mutual	1
exchange	1
of	1
confidence?"	1
"I	1
confess,"	1
replied	1
Elinor,	1
"that	1
every	1
circumstance	1
except	1
ONE	1
is	1
in	1
favour	1
of	1
their	1
engagement;	1
but	1
that	1
ONE	1
is	1
the	1
total	1
silence	1
of	1
both	1
on	1
the	1
subject,	1
and	1
with	1
me	1
it	1
almost	1
outweighs	1
every	1
other."	1
"How	1
strange	1
this	1
is!	1
You	1
must	1
think	1
wretchedly	1
indeed	1
of	1
Willoughby,	1
if,	1
after	1
all	1
that	1
has	1
openly	1
passed	1
between	1
them,	1
you	1
can	1
doubt	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
terms	1
on	1
which	1
they	1
are	1
together.	1
Has	1
he	1
been	1
acting	1
a	1
part	1
in	1
his	1
behaviour	1
to	1
your	1
sister	1
all	1
this	1
time?	1
Do	1
you	1
suppose	1
him	1
really	1
indifferent	1
to	1
her?"	1
"No,	1
I	1
cannot	1
think	1
that.	1
He	1
must	1
and	1
does	1
love	1
her	1
I	1
am	1
sure."	1
"But	1
with	1
a	1
strange	1
kind	1
of	1
tenderness,	1
if	1
he	1
can	1
leave	1
her	1
with	1
such	1
indifference,	1
such	1
carelessness	1
of	1
the	1
future,	1
as	1
you	1
attribute	1
to	1
him."	1
"You	1
must	1
remember,	1
my	1
dear	1
mother,	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
considered	1
this	1
matter	1
as	1
certain.	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
my	1
doubts,	1
I	1
confess;	1
but	1
they	1
are	1
fainter	1
than	1
they	1
were,	1
and	1
they	1
may	1
soon	1
be	1
entirely	1
done	1
away.	1
If	1
we	1
find	1
they	1
correspond,	1
every	1
fear	1
of	1
mine	1
will	1
be	1
removed."	1
"A	1
mighty	1
concession	1
indeed!	1
If	1
you	1
were	1
to	1
see	1
them	1
at	1
the	1
altar,	1
you	1
would	1
suppose	1
they	1
were	1
going	1
to	1
be	1
married.	1
Ungracious	1
girl!	1
But	1
I	1
require	1
no	1
such	1
proof.	1
Nothing	1
in	1
my	1
opinion	1
has	1
ever	1
passed	1
to	1
justify	1
doubt;	1
no	1
secrecy	1
has	1
been	1
attempted;	1
all	1
has	1
been	1
uniformly	1
open	1
and	1
unreserved.	1
You	1
cannot	1
doubt	1
your	1
sister's	1
wishes.	1
It	1
must	1
be	1
Willoughby	1
therefore	1
whom	1
you	1
suspect.	1
But	1
why?	1
Is	1
he	1
not	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
honour	1
and	1
feeling?	1
Has	1
there	1
been	1
any	1
inconsistency	1
on	1
his	1
side	1
to	1
create	1
alarm?	1
can	1
he	1
be	1
deceitful?"	1
"I	1
hope	1
not,	1
I	1
believe	1
not,"	1
cried	1
Elinor.	1
"I	1
love	1
Willoughby,	1
sincerely	1
love	1
him;	1
and	1
suspicion	1
of	1
his	1
integrity	1
cannot	1
be	1
more	1
painful	1
to	1
yourself	1
than	1
to	1
me.	1
It	1
has	1
been	1
involuntary,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
encourage	1
it.	1
I	1
was	1
startled,	1
I	1
confess,	1
by	1
the	1
alteration	1
in	1
his	1
manners	1
this	1
morning;--he	1
did	1
not	1
speak	1
like	1
himself,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
return	1
your	1
kindness	1
with	1
any	1
cordiality.	1
But	1
all	1
this	1
may	1
be	1
explained	1
by	1
such	1
a	1
situation	1
of	1
his	1
affairs	1
as	1
you	1
have	1
supposed.	1
He	1
had	1
just	1
parted	1
from	1
my	1
sister,	1
had	1
seen	1
her	1
leave	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
greatest	1
affliction;	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
felt	1
obliged,	1
from	1
a	1
fear	1
of	1
offending	1
Mrs.	1
Smith,	1
to	1
resist	1
the	1
temptation	1
of	1
returning	1
here	1
soon,	1
and	1
yet	1
aware	1
that	1
by	1
declining	1
your	1
invitation,	1
by	1
saying	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
away	1
for	1
some	1
time,	1
he	1
should	1
seem	1
to	1
act	1
an	1
ungenerous,	1
a	1
suspicious	1
part	1
by	1
our	1
family,	1
be	1
might	1
well	1
be	1
embarrassed	1
and	1
disturbed.	1
In	1
such	1
a	1
case,	1
a	1
plain	1
and	1
open	1
avowal	1
of	1
his	1
difficulties	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
more	1
to	1
his	1
honour	1
I	1
think,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
more	1
consistent	1
with	1
his	1
general	1
character;--but	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
raise	1
objections	1
against	1
any	1
one's	1
conduct	1
on	1
so	1
illiberal	1
a	1
foundation,	1
as	1
a	1
difference	1
in	1
judgment	1
from	1
myself,	1
or	1
a	1
deviation	1
from	1
what	1
I	1
may	1
think	1
right	1
and	1
consistent."	1
"You	1
speak	1
very	1
properly.	1
Willoughby	1
certainly	1
does	1
not	1
deserve	1
to	1
be	1
suspected.	1
Though	1
WE	1
have	1
not	1
known	1
him	1
long,	1
he	1
is	1
no	1
stranger	1
in	1
this	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
world;	1
and	1
who	1
has	1
ever	1
spoken	1
to	1
his	1
disadvantage?	1
Had	1
he	1
been	1
in	1
a	1
situation	1
to	1
act	1
independently	1
and	1
marry	1
immediately,	1
it	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
odd	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
leave	1
us	1
without	1
acknowledging	1
everything	1
to	1
me	1
at	1
once:	1
but	1
this	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
case.	1
It	1
is	1
an	1
engagement	1
in	1
some	1
respects	1
not	1
prosperously	1
begun,	1
for	1
their	1
marriage	1
must	1
be	1
at	1
a	1
very	1
uncertain	1
distance;	1
and	1
even	1
secrecy,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
it	1
can	1
be	1
observed,	1
may	1
now	1
be	1
very	1
advisable."	1
They	1
were	1
interrupted	1
by	1
the	1
entrance	1
of	1
Margaret;	1
and	1
Elinor	1
was	1
then	1
at	1
liberty	1
to	1
think	1
over	1
the	1
representations	1
of	1
her	1
mother,	1
to	1
acknowledge	1
the	1
probability	1
of	1
many,	1
and	1
hope	1
for	1
the	1
justice	1
of	1
all.	1
They	1
saw	1
nothing	1
of	1
Marianne	1
till	1
dinner	1
time,	1
when	1
she	1
entered	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
took	1
her	1
place	1
at	1
the	1
table	1
without	1
saying	1
a	1
word.	1
Her	1
eyes	1
were	1
red	1
and	1
swollen;	1
and	1
it	1
seemed	1
as	1
if	1
her	1
tears	1
were	1
even	1
then	1
restrained	1
with	1
difficulty.	1
She	1
avoided	1
the	1
looks	1
of	1
them	1
all,	1
could	1
neither	1
eat	1
nor	1
speak,	1
and	1
after	1
some	1
time,	1
on	1
her	1
mother's	1
silently	1
pressing	1
her	1
hand	1
with	1
tender	1
compassion,	1
her	1
small	1
degree	1
of	1
fortitude	1
was	1
quite	1
overcome,	1
she	1
burst	1
into	1
tears	1
and	1
left	1
the	1
room.	1
This	1
violent	1
oppression	1
of	1
spirits	1
continued	1
the	1
whole	1
evening.	1
She	1
was	1
without	1
any	1
power,	1
because	1
she	1
was	1
without	1
any	1
desire	1
of	1
command	1
over	1
herself.	1
The	1
slightest	1
mention	1
of	1
anything	1
relative	1
to	1
Willoughby	1
overpowered	1
her	1
in	1
an	1
instant;	1
and	1
though	1
her	1
family	1
were	1
most	1
anxiously	1
attentive	1
to	1
her	1
comfort,	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
for	1
them,	1
if	1
they	1
spoke	1
at	1
all,	1
to	1
keep	1
clear	1
of	1
every	1
subject	1
which	1
her	1
feelings	1
connected	1
with	1
him.	1
CHAPTER	1
16	1
Marianne	1
would	1
have	1
thought	1
herself	1
very	1
inexcusable	1
had	1
she	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
sleep	1
at	1
all	1
the	1
first	1
night	1
after	1
parting	1
from	1
Willoughby.	1
She	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
ashamed	1
to	1
look	1
her	1
family	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
the	1
next	1
morning,	1
had	1
she	1
not	1
risen	1
from	1
her	1
bed	1
in	1
more	1
need	1
of	1
repose	1
than	1
when	1
she	1
lay	1
down	1
in	1
it.	1
But	1
the	1
feelings	1
which	1
made	1
such	1
composure	1
a	1
disgrace,	1
left	1
her	1
in	1
no	1
danger	1
of	1
incurring	1
it.	1
She	1
was	1
awake	1
the	1
whole	1
night,	1
and	1
she	1
wept	1
the	1
greatest	1
part	1
of	1
it.	1
She	1
got	1
up	1
with	1
a	1
headache,	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
talk,	1
and	1
unwilling	1
to	1
take	1
any	1
nourishment;	1
giving	1
pain	1
every	1
moment	1
to	1
her	1
mother	1
and	1
sisters,	1
and	1
forbidding	1
all	1
attempt	1
at	1
consolation	1
from	1
either.	1
Her	1
sensibility	1
was	1
potent	1
enough!	1
When	1
breakfast	1
was	1
over	1
she	1
walked	1
out	1
by	1
herself,	1
and	1
wandered	1
about	1
the	1
village	1
of	1
Allenham,	1
indulging	1
the	1
recollection	1
of	1
past	1
enjoyment	1
and	1
crying	1
over	1
the	1
present	1
reverse	1
for	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
morning.	1
The	1
evening	1
passed	1
off	1
in	1
the	1
equal	1
indulgence	1
of	1
feeling.	1
She	1
played	1
over	1
every	1
favourite	1
song	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
used	1
to	1
play	1
to	1
Willoughby,	1
every	1
air	1
in	1
which	1
their	1
voices	1
had	1
been	1
oftenest	1
joined,	1
and	1
sat	1
at	1
the	1
instrument	1
gazing	1
on	1
every	1
line	1
of	1
music	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
written	1
out	1
for	1
her,	1
till	1
her	1
heart	1
was	1
so	1
heavy	1
that	1
no	1
farther	1
sadness	1
could	1
be	1
gained;	1
and	1
this	1
nourishment	1
of	1
grief	1
was	1
every	1
day	1
applied.	1
She	1
spent	1
whole	1
hours	1
at	1
the	1
pianoforte	1
alternately	1
singing	1
and	1
crying;	1
her	1
voice	1
often	1
totally	1
suspended	1
by	1
her	1
tears.	1
In	1
books	1
too,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
in	1
music,	1
she	1
courted	1
the	1
misery	1
which	1
a	1
contrast	1
between	1
the	1
past	1
and	1
present	1
was	1
certain	1
of	1
giving.	1
She	1
read	1
nothing	1
but	1
what	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
used	1
to	1
read	1
together.	1
Such	1
violence	1
of	1
affliction	1
indeed	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
supported	1
for	1
ever;	1
it	1
sunk	1
within	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
into	1
a	1
calmer	1
melancholy;	1
but	1
these	1
employments,	1
to	1
which	1
she	1
daily	1
recurred,	1
her	1
solitary	1
walks	1
and	1
silent	1
meditations,	1
still	1
produced	1
occasional	1
effusions	1
of	1
sorrow	1
as	1
lively	1
as	1
ever.	1
No	1
letter	1
from	1
Willoughby	1
came;	1
and	1
none	1
seemed	1
expected	1
by	1
Marianne.	1
Her	1
mother	1
was	1
surprised,	1
and	1
Elinor	1
again	1
became	1
uneasy.	1
But	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood	1
could	1
find	1
explanations	1
whenever	1
she	1
wanted	1
them,	1
which	1
at	1
least	1
satisfied	1
herself.	1
"Remember,	1
Elinor,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"how	1
very	1
often	1
Sir	1
John	1
fetches	1
our	1
letters	1
himself	1
from	1
the	1
post,	1
and	1
carries	1
them	1
to	1
it.	1
We	1
have	1
already	1
agreed	1
that	1
secrecy	1
may	1
be	1
necessary,	1
and	1
we	1
must	1
acknowledge	1
that	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
maintained	1
if	1
their	1
correspondence	1
were	1
to	1
pass	1
through	1
Sir	1
John's	1
hands."	1
Elinor	1
could	1
not	1
deny	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
this,	1
and	1
she	1
tried	1
to	1
find	1
in	1
it	1
a	1
motive	1
sufficient	1
for	1
their	1
silence.	1
But	1
there	1
was	1
one	1
method	1
so	1
direct,	1
so	1
simple,	1
and	1
in	1
her	1
opinion	1
so	1
eligible	1
of	1
knowing	1
the	1
real	1
state	1
of	1
the	1
affair,	1
and	1
of	1
instantly	1
removing	1
all	1
mystery,	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
suggesting	1
it	1
to	1
her	1
mother.	1
"Why	1
do	1
you	1
not	1
ask	1
Marianne	1
at	1
once,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"whether	1
she	1
is	1
or	1
she	1
is	1
not	1
engaged	1
to	1
Willoughby?	1
From	1
you,	1
her	1
mother,	1
and	1
so	1
kind,	1
so	1
indulgent	1
a	1
mother,	1
the	1
question	1
could	1
not	1
give	1
offence.	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
natural	1
result	1
of	1
your	1
affection	1
for	1
her.	1
She	1
used	1
to	1
be	1
all	1
unreserve,	1
and	1
to	1
you	1
more	1
especially."	1
"I	1
would	1
not	1
ask	1
such	1
a	1
question	1
for	1
the	1
world.	1
Supposing	1
it	1
possible	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
engaged,	1
what	1
distress	1
would	1
not	1
such	1
an	1
enquiry	1
inflict!	1
At	1
any	1
rate	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
most	1
ungenerous.	1
I	1
should	1
never	1
deserve	1
her	1
confidence	1
again,	1
after	1
forcing	1
from	1
her	1
a	1
confession	1
of	1
what	1
is	1
meant	1
at	1
present	1
to	1
be	1
unacknowledged	1
to	1
any	1
one.	1
I	1
know	1
Marianne's	1
heart:	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
she	1
dearly	1
loves	1
me,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
the	1
last	1
to	1
whom	1
the	1
affair	1
is	1
made	1
known,	1
when	1
circumstances	1
make	1
the	1
revealment	1
of	1
it	1
eligible.	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
attempt	1
to	1
force	1
the	1
confidence	1
of	1
any	1
one;	1
of	1
a	1
child	1
much	1
less;	1
because	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
duty	1
would	1
prevent	1
the	1
denial	1
which	1
her	1
wishes	1
might	1
direct."	1
Elinor	1
thought	1
this	1
generosity	1
overstrained,	1
considering	1
her	1
sister's	1
youth,	1
and	1
urged	1
the	1
matter	1
farther,	1
but	1
in	1
vain;	1
common	1
sense,	1
common	1
care,	1
common	1
prudence,	1
were	1
all	1
sunk	1
in	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood's	1
romantic	1
delicacy.	1
It	1
was	1
several	1
days	1
before	1
Willoughby's	1
name	1
was	1
mentioned	1
before	1
Marianne	1
by	1
any	1
of	1
her	1
family;	1
Sir	1
John	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings,	1
indeed,	1
were	1
not	1
so	1
nice;	1
their	1
witticisms	1
added	1
pain	1
to	1
many	1
a	1
painful	1
hour;--	1
but	1
one	1
evening,	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood,	1
accidentally	1
taking	1
up	1
a	1
volume	1
of	1
Shakespeare,	1
exclaimed,	1
"We	1
have	1
never	1
finished	1
Hamlet,	1
Marianne;	1
our	1
dear	1
Willoughby	1
went	1
away	1
before	1
we	1
could	1
get	1
through	1
it.	1
We	1
will	1
put	1
it	1
by,	1
that	1
when	1
he	1
comes	1
again...But	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
months,	1
perhaps,	1
before	1
THAT	1
happens."	1
"Months!"	1
cried	1
Marianne,	1
with	1
strong	1
surprise.	1
"No--nor	1
many	1
weeks."	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood	1
was	1
sorry	1
for	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
said;	1
but	1
it	1
gave	1
Elinor	1
pleasure,	1
as	1
it	1
produced	1
a	1
reply	1
from	1
Marianne	1
so	1
expressive	1
of	1
confidence	1
in	1
Willoughby	1
and	1
knowledge	1
of	1
his	1
intentions.	1
One	1
morning,	1
about	1
a	1
week	1
after	1
his	1
leaving	1
the	1
country,	1
Marianne	1
was	1
prevailed	1
on	1
to	1
join	1
her	1
sisters	1
in	1
their	1
usual	1
walk,	1
instead	1
of	1
wandering	1
away	1
by	1
herself.	1
Hitherto	1
she	1
had	1
carefully	1
avoided	1
every	1
companion	1
in	1
her	1
rambles.	1
If	1
her	1
sisters	1
intended	1
to	1
walk	1
on	1
the	1
downs,	1
she	1
directly	1
stole	1
away	1
towards	1
the	1
lanes;	1
if	1
they	1
talked	1
of	1
the	1
valley,	1
she	1
was	1
as	1
speedy	1
in	1
climbing	1
the	1
hills,	1
and	1
could	1
never	1
be	1
found	1
when	1
the	1
others	1
set	1
off.	1
But	1
at	1
length	1
she	1
was	1
secured	1
by	1
the	1
exertions	1
of	1
Elinor,	1
who	1
greatly	1
disapproved	1
such	1
continual	1
seclusion.	1
They	1
walked	1
along	1
the	1
road	1
through	1
the	1
valley,	1
and	1
chiefly	1
in	1
silence,	1
for	1
Marianne's	1
MIND	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
controlled,	1
and	1
Elinor,	1
satisfied	1
with	1
gaining	1
one	1
point,	1
would	1
not	1
then	1
attempt	1
more.	1
Beyond	1
the	1
entrance	1
of	1
the	1
valley,	1
where	1
the	1
country,	1
though	1
still	1
rich,	1
was	1
less	1
wild	1
and	1
more	1
open,	1
a	1
long	1
stretch	1
of	1
the	1
road	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
travelled	1
on	1
first	1
coming	1
to	1
Barton,	1
lay	1
before	1
them;	1
and	1
on	1
reaching	1
that	1
point,	1
they	1
stopped	1
to	1
look	1
around	1
them,	1
and	1
examine	1
a	1
prospect	1
which	1
formed	1
the	1
distance	1
of	1
their	1
view	1
from	1
the	1
cottage,	1
from	1
a	1
spot	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
never	1
happened	1
to	1
reach	1
in	1
any	1
of	1
their	1
walks	1
before.	1
Amongst	1
the	1
objects	1
in	1
the	1
scene,	1
they	1
soon	1
discovered	1
an	1
animated	1
one;	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
on	1
horseback	1
riding	1
towards	1
them.	1
In	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
they	1
could	1
distinguish	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
gentleman;	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
moment	1
afterwards	1
Marianne	1
rapturously	1
exclaimed,	1
"It	1
is	1
he;	1
it	1
is	1
indeed;--I	1
know	1
it	1
is!"--and	1
was	1
hastening	1
to	1
meet	1
him,	1
when	1
Elinor	1
cried	1
out,	1
"Indeed,	1
Marianne,	1
I	1
think	1
you	1
are	1
mistaken.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
Willoughby.	1
The	1
person	1
is	1
not	1
tall	1
enough	1
for	1
him,	1
and	1
has	1
not	1
his	1
air."	1
"He	1
has,	1
he	1
has,"	1
cried	1
Marianne,	1
"I	1
am	1
sure	1
he	1
has.	1
His	1
air,	1
his	1
coat,	1
his	1
horse.	1
I	1
knew	1
how	1
soon	1
he	1
would	1
come."	1
She	1
walked	1
eagerly	1
on	1
as	1
she	1
spoke;	1
and	1
Elinor,	1
to	1
screen	1
Marianne	1
from	1
particularity,	1
as	1
she	1
felt	1
almost	1
certain	1
of	1
its	1
not	1
being	1
Willoughby,	1
quickened	1
her	1
pace	1
and	1
kept	1
up	1
with	1
her.	1
They	1
were	1
soon	1
within	1
thirty	1
yards	1
of	1
the	1
gentleman.	1
Marianne	1
looked	1
again;	1
her	1
heart	1
sunk	1
within	1
her;	1
and	1
abruptly	1
turning	1
round,	1
she	1
was	1
hurrying	1
back,	1
when	1
the	1
voices	1
of	1
both	1
her	1
sisters	1
were	1
raised	1
to	1
detain	1
her;	1
a	1
third,	1
almost	1
as	1
well	1
known	1
as	1
Willoughby's,	1
joined	1
them	1
in	1
begging	1
her	1
to	1
stop,	1
and	1
she	1
turned	1
round	1
with	1
surprise	1
to	1
see	1
and	1
welcome	1
Edward	1
Ferrars.	1
He	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
person	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
who	1
could	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
be	1
forgiven	1
for	1
not	1
being	1
Willoughby;	1
the	1
only	1
one	1
who	1
could	1
have	1
gained	1
a	1
smile	1
from	1
her;	1
but	1
she	1
dispersed	1
her	1
tears	1
to	1
smile	1
on	1
HIM,	1
and	1
in	1
her	1
sister's	1
happiness	1
forgot	1
for	1
a	1
time	1
her	1
own	1
disappointment.	1
He	1
dismounted,	1
and	1
giving	1
his	1
horse	1
to	1
his	1
servant,	1
walked	1
back	1
with	1
them	1
to	1
Barton,	1
whither	1
he	1
was	1
purposely	1
coming	1
to	1
visit	1
them.	1
He	1
was	1
welcomed	1
by	1
them	1
all	1
with	1
great	1
cordiality,	1
but	1
especially	1
by	1
Marianne,	1
who	1
showed	1
more	1
warmth	1
of	1
regard	1
in	1
her	1
reception	1
of	1
him	1
than	1
even	1
Elinor	1
herself.	1
To	1
Marianne,	1
indeed,	1
the	1
meeting	1
between	1
Edward	1
and	1
her	1
sister	1
was	1
but	1
a	1
continuation	1
of	1
that	1
unaccountable	1
coldness	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
often	1
observed	1
at	1
Norland	1
in	1
their	1
mutual	1
behaviour.	1
On	1
Edward's	1
side,	1
more	1
particularly,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
deficiency	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
a	1
lover	1
ought	1
to	1
look	1
and	1
say	1
on	1
such	1
an	1
occasion.	1
He	1
was	1
confused,	1
seemed	1
scarcely	1
sensible	1
of	1
pleasure	1
in	1
seeing	1
them,	1
looked	1
neither	1
rapturous	1
nor	1
gay,	1
said	1
little	1
but	1
what	1
was	1
forced	1
from	1
him	1
by	1
questions,	1
and	1
distinguished	1
Elinor	1
by	1
no	1
mark	1
of	1
affection.	1
Marianne	1
saw	1
and	1
listened	1
with	1
increasing	1
surprise.	1
She	1
began	1
almost	1
to	1
feel	1
a	1
dislike	1
of	1
Edward;	1
and	1
it	1
ended,	1
as	1
every	1
feeling	1
must	1
end	1
with	1
her,	1
by	1
carrying	1
back	1
her	1
thoughts	1
to	1
Willoughby,	1
whose	1
manners	1
formed	1
a	1
contrast	1
sufficiently	1
striking	1
to	1
those	1
of	1
his	1
brother	1
elect.	1
After	1
a	1
short	1
silence	1
which	1
succeeded	1
the	1
first	1
surprise	1
and	1
enquiries	1
of	1
meeting,	1
Marianne	1
asked	1
Edward	1
if	1
he	1
came	1
directly	1
from	1
London.	1
No,	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
Devonshire	1
a	1
fortnight.	1
"A	1
fortnight!"	1
she	1
repeated,	1
surprised	1
at	1
his	1
being	1
so	1
long	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
county	1
with	1
Elinor	1
without	1
seeing	1
her	1
before.	1
He	1
looked	1
rather	1
distressed	1
as	1
he	1
added,	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
staying	1
with	1
some	1
friends	1
near	1
Plymouth.	1
"Have	1
you	1
been	1
lately	1
in	1
Sussex?"	1
said	1
Elinor.	1
"I	1
was	1
at	1
Norland	1
about	1
a	1
month	1
ago."	1
"And	1
how	1
does	1
dear,	1
dear	1
Norland	1
look?"	1
cried	1
Marianne.	1
"Dear,	1
dear	1
Norland,"	1
said	1
Elinor,	1
"probably	1
looks	1
much	1
as	1
it	1
always	1
does	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
year.	1
The	1
woods	1
and	1
walks	1
thickly	1
covered	1
with	1
dead	1
leaves."	1
"Oh,"	1
cried	1
Marianne,	1
"with	1
what	1
transporting	1
sensation	1
have	1
I	1
formerly	1
seen	1
them	1
fall!	1
How	1
have	1
I	1
delighted,	1
as	1
I	1
walked,	1
to	1
see	1
them	1
driven	1
in	1
showers	1
about	1
me	1
by	1
the	1
wind!	1
What	1
feelings	1
have	1
they,	1
the	1
season,	1
the	1
air	1
altogether	1
inspired!	1
Now	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
regard	1
them.	1
They	1
are	1
seen	1
only	1
as	1
a	1
nuisance,	1
swept	1
hastily	1
off,	1
and	1
driven	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
possible	1
from	1
the	1
sight."	1
"It	1
is	1
not	1
every	1
one,"	1
said	1
Elinor,	1
"who	1
has	1
your	1
passion	1
for	1
dead	1
leaves."	1
"No;	1
my	1
feelings	1
are	1
not	1
often	1
shared,	1
not	1
often	1
understood.	1
But	1
SOMETIMES	1
they	1
are."--As	1
she	1
said	1
this,	1
she	1
sunk	1
into	1
a	1
reverie	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
moments;--but	1
rousing	1
herself	1
again,	1
"Now,	1
Edward,"	1
said	1
she,	1
calling	1
his	1
attention	1
to	1
the	1
prospect,	1
"here	1
is	1
Barton	1
valley.	1
Look	1
up	1
to	1
it,	1
and	1
be	1
tranquil	1
if	1
you	1
can.	1
Look	1
at	1
those	1
hills!	1
Did	1
you	1
ever	1
see	1
their	1
equals?	1
To	1
the	1
left	1
is	1
Barton	1
park,	1
amongst	1
those	1
woods	1
and	1
plantations.	1
You	1
may	1
see	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
house.	1
And	1
there,	1
beneath	1
that	1
farthest	1
hill,	1
which	1
rises	1
with	1
such	1
grandeur,	1
is	1
our	1
cottage."	1
"It	1
is	1
a	1
beautiful	1
country,"	1
he	1
replied;	1
"but	1
these	1
bottoms	1
must	1
be	1
dirty	1
in	1
winter."	1
"How	1
can	1
you	1
think	1
of	1
dirt,	1
with	1
such	1
objects	1
before	1
you?"	1
"Because,"	1
replied	1
he,	1
smiling,	1
"among	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
objects	1
before	1
me,	1
I	1
see	1
a	1
very	1
dirty	1
lane."	1
"How	1
strange!"	1
said	1
Marianne	1
to	1
herself	1
as	1
she	1
walked	1
on.	1
"Have	1
you	1
an	1
agreeable	1
neighbourhood	1
here?	1
Are	1
the	1
Middletons	1
pleasant	1
people?"	1
"No,	1
not	1
all,"	1
answered	1
Marianne;	1
"we	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
more	1
unfortunately	1
situated."	1
"Marianne,"	1
cried	1
her	1
sister,	1
"how	1
can	1
you	1
say	1
so?	1
How	1
can	1
you	1
be	1
so	1
unjust?	1
They	1
are	1
a	1
very	1
respectable	1
family,	1
Mr.	1
Ferrars;	1
and	1
towards	1
us	1
have	1
behaved	1
in	1
the	1
friendliest	1
manner.	1
Have	1
you	1
forgot,	1
Marianne,	1
how	1
many	1
pleasant	1
days	1
we	1
have	1
owed	1
to	1
them?"	1
"No,"	1
said	1
Marianne,	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice,	1
"nor	1
how	1
many	1
painful	1
moments."	1
Elinor	1
took	1
no	1
notice	1
of	1
this;	1
and	1
directing	1
her	1
attention	1
to	1
their	1
visitor,	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
support	1
something	1
like	1
discourse	1
with	1
him,	1
by	1
talking	1
of	1
their	1
present	1
residence,	1
its	1
conveniences,	1
&c.	1
extorting	1
from	1
him	1
occasional	1
questions	1
and	1
remarks.	1
His	1
coldness	1
and	1
reserve	1
mortified	1
her	1
severely;	1
she	1
was	1
vexed	1
and	1
half	1
angry;	1
but	1
resolving	1
to	1
regulate	1
her	1
behaviour	1
to	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
past	1
rather	1
than	1
the	1
present,	1
she	1
avoided	1
every	1
appearance	1
of	1
resentment	1
or	1
displeasure,	1
and	1
treated	1
him	1
as	1
she	1
thought	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
treated	1
from	1
the	1
family	1
connection.	1
CHAPTER	1
17	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood	1
was	1
surprised	1
only	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
at	1
seeing	1
him;	1
for	1
his	1
coming	1
to	1
Barton	1
was,	1
in	1
her	1
opinion,	1
of	1
all	1
things	1
the	1
most	1
natural.	1
Her	1
joy	1
and	1
expression	1
of	1
regard	1
long	1
outlived	1
her	1
wonder.	1
He	1
received	1
the	1
kindest	1
welcome	1
from	1
her;	1
and	1
shyness,	1
coldness,	1
reserve	1
could	1
not	1
stand	1
against	1
such	1
a	1
reception.	1
They	1
had	1
begun	1
to	1
fail	1
him	1
before	1
he	1
entered	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
quite	1
overcome	1
by	1
the	1
captivating	1
manners	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood.	1
Indeed	1
a	1
man	1
could	1
not	1
very	1
well	1
be	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
either	1
of	1
her	1
daughters,	1
without	1
extending	1
the	1
passion	1
to	1
her;	1
and	1
Elinor	1
had	1
the	1
satisfaction	1
of	1
seeing	1
him	1
soon	1
become	1
more	1
like	1
himself.	1
His	1
affections	1
seemed	1
to	1
reanimate	1
towards	1
them	1
all,	1
and	1
his	1
interest	1
in	1
their	1
welfare	1
again	1
became	1
perceptible.	1
He	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
spirits,	1
however;	1
he	1
praised	1
their	1
house,	1
admired	1
its	1
prospect,	1
was	1
attentive,	1
and	1
kind;	1
but	1
still	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
spirits.	1
The	1
whole	1
family	1
perceived	1
it,	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood,	1
attributing	1
it	1
to	1
some	1
want	1
of	1
liberality	1
in	1
his	1
mother,	1
sat	1
down	1
to	1
table	1
indignant	1
against	1
all	1
selfish	1
parents.	1
"What	1
are	1
Mrs.	1
Ferrars's	1
views	1
for	1
you	1
at	1
present,	1
Edward?"	1
said	1
she,	1
when	1
dinner	1
was	1
over	1
and	1
they	1
had	1
drawn	1
round	1
the	1
fire;	1
"are	1
you	1
still	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
great	1
orator	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
yourself?"	1
"No.	1
I	1
hope	1
my	1
mother	1
is	1
now	1
convinced	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
more	1
talents	1
than	1
inclination	1
for	1
a	1
public	1
life!"	1
"But	1
how	1
is	1
your	1
fame	1
to	1
be	1
established?	1
for	1
famous	1
you	1
must	1
be	1
to	1
satisfy	1
all	1
your	1
family;	1
and	1
with	1
no	1
inclination	1
for	1
expense,	1
no	1
affection	1
for	1
strangers,	1
no	1
profession,	1
and	1
no	1
assurance,	1
you	1
may	1
find	1
it	1
a	1
difficult	1
matter."	1
"I	1
shall	1
not	1
attempt	1
it.	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
wish	1
to	1
be	1
distinguished;	1
and	1
have	1
every	1
reason	1
to	1
hope	1
I	1
never	1
shall.	1
Thank	1
Heaven!	1
I	1
cannot	1
be	1
forced	1
into	1
genius	1
and	1
eloquence."	1
"You	1
have	1
no	1
ambition,	1
I	1
well	1
know.	1
Your	1
wishes	1
are	1
all	1
moderate."	1
"As	1
moderate	1
as	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
I	1
believe.	1
I	1
wish	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
every	1
body	1
else	1
to	1
be	1
perfectly	1
happy;	1
but,	1
like	1
every	1
body	1
else	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
in	1
my	1
own	1
way.	1
Greatness	1
will	1
not	1
make	1
me	1
so."	1
"Strange	1
that	1
it	1
would!"	1
cried	1
Marianne.	1
"What	1
have	1
wealth	1
or	1
grandeur	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
happiness?"	1
"Grandeur	1
has	1
but	1
little,"	1
said	1
Elinor,	1
"but	1
wealth	1
has	1
much	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
it."	1
"Elinor,	1
for	1
shame!"	1
said	1
Marianne,	1
"money	1
can	1
only	1
give	1
happiness	1
where	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
else	1
to	1
give	1
it.	1
Beyond	1
a	1
competence,	1
it	1
can	1
afford	1
no	1
real	1
satisfaction,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
mere	1
self	1
is	1
concerned."	1
"Perhaps,"	1
said	1
Elinor,	1
smiling,	1
"we	1
may	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
point.	1
YOUR	1
competence	1
and	1
MY	1
wealth	1
are	1
very	1
much	1
alike,	1
I	1
dare	1
say;	1
and	1
without	1
them,	1
as	1
the	1
world	1
goes	1
now,	1
we	1
shall	1
both	1
agree	1
that	1
every	1
kind	1
of	1
external	1
comfort	1
must	1
be	1
wanting.	1
Your	1
ideas	1
are	1
only	1
more	1
noble	1
than	1
mine.	1
Come,	1
what	1
is	1
your	1
competence?"	1
"About	1
eighteen	1
hundred	1
or	1
two	1
thousand	1
a	1
year;	1
not	1
more	1
than	1
THAT."	1
Elinor	1
laughed.	1
"TWO	1
thousand	1
a	1
year!	1
ONE	1
is	1
my	1
wealth!	1
I	1
guessed	1
how	1
it	1
would	1
end."	1
"And	1
yet	1
two	1
thousand	1
a-year	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
moderate	1
income,"	1
said	1
Marianne.	1
"A	1
family	1
cannot	1
well	1
be	1
maintained	1
on	1
a	1
smaller.	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
extravagant	1
in	1
my	1
demands.	1
A	1
proper	1
establishment	1
of	1
servants,	1
a	1
carriage,	1
perhaps	1
two,	1
and	1
hunters,	1
cannot	1
be	1
supported	1
on	1
less."	1
Elinor	1
smiled	1
again,	1
to	1
hear	1
her	1
sister	1
describing	1
so	1
accurately	1
their	1
future	1
expenses	1
at	1
Combe	1
Magna.	1
"Hunters!"	1
repeated	1
Edward--"but	1
why	1
must	1
you	1
have	1
hunters?	1
Every	1
body	1
does	1
not	1
hunt."	1
Marianne	1
coloured	1
as	1
she	1
replied,	1
"But	1
most	1
people	1
do."	1
"I	1
wish,"	1
said	1
Margaret,	1
striking	1
out	1
a	1
novel	1
thought,	1
"that	1
somebody	1
would	1
give	1
us	1
all	1
a	1
large	1
fortune	1
apiece!"	1
"Oh	1
that	1
they	1
would!"	1
cried	1
Marianne,	1
her	1
eyes	1
sparkling	1
with	1
animation,	1
and	1
her	1
cheeks	1
glowing	1
with	1
the	1
delight	1
of	1
such	1
imaginary	1
happiness.	1
"We	1
are	1
all	1
unanimous	1
in	1
that	1
wish,	1
I	1
suppose,"	1
said	1
Elinor,	1
"in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
insufficiency	1
of	1
wealth."	1
"Oh	1
dear!"	1
cried	1
Margaret,	1
"how	1
happy	1
I	1
should	1
be!	1
I	1
wonder	1
what	1
I	1
should	1
do	1
with	1
it!"	1
Marianne	1
looked	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
doubt	1
on	1
that	1
point.	1
"I	1
should	1
be	1
puzzled	1
to	1
spend	1
so	1
large	1
a	1
fortune	1
myself,"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood,	1
"if	1
my	1
children	1
were	1
all	1
to	1
be	1
rich	1
my	1
help."	1
"You	1
must	1
begin	1
your	1
improvements	1
on	1
this	1
house,"	1
observed	1
Elinor,	1
"and	1
your	1
difficulties	1
will	1
soon	1
vanish."	1
"What	1
magnificent	1
orders	1
would	1
travel	1
from	1
this	1
family	1
to	1
London,"	1
said	1
Edward,	1
"in	1
such	1
an	1
event!	1
What	1
a	1
happy	1
day	1
for	1
booksellers,	1
music-sellers,	1
and	1
print-shops!	1
You,	1
Miss	1
Dashwood,	1
would	1
give	1
a	1
general	1
commission	1
for	1
every	1
new	1
print	1
of	1
merit	1
to	1
be	1
sent	1
you--and	1
as	1
for	1
Marianne,	1
I	1
know	1
her	1
greatness	1
of	1
soul,	1
there	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
music	1
enough	1
in	1
London	1
to	1
content	1
her.	1
And	1
books!--Thomson,	1
Cowper,	1
Scott--she	1
would	1
buy	1
them	1
all	1
over	1
and	1
over	1
again:	1
she	1
would	1
buy	1
up	1
every	1
copy,	1
I	1
believe,	1
to	1
prevent	1
their	1
falling	1
into	1
unworthy	1
hands;	1
and	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
every	1
book	1
that	1
tells	1
her	1
how	1
to	1
admire	1
an	1
old	1
twisted	1
tree.	1
Should	1
not	1
you,	1
Marianne?	1
Forgive	1
me,	1
if	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
saucy.	1
But	1
I	1
was	1
willing	1
to	1
shew	1
you	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
forgot	1
our	1
old	1
disputes."	1
"I	1
love	1
to	1
be	1
reminded	1
of	1
the	1
past,	1
Edward--whether	1
it	1
be	1
melancholy	1
or	1
gay,	1
I	1
love	1
to	1
recall	1
it--and	1
you	1
will	1
never	1
offend	1
me	1
by	1
talking	1
of	1
former	1
times.	1
You	1
are	1
very	1
right	1
in	1
supposing	1
how	1
my	1
money	1
would	1
be	1
spent--some	1
of	1
it,	1
at	1
least--my	1
loose	1
cash	1
would	1
certainly	1
be	1
employed	1
in	1
improving	1
my	1
collection	1
of	1
music	1
and	1
books."	1
"And	1
the	1
bulk	1
of	1
your	1
fortune	1
would	1
be	1
laid	1
out	1
in	1
annuities	1
on	1
the	1
authors	1
or	1
their	1
heirs."	1
"No,	1
Edward,	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
something	1
else	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
it."	1
"Perhaps,	1
then,	1
you	1
would	1
bestow	1
it	1
as	1
a	1
reward	1
on	1
that	1
person	1
who	1
wrote	1
the	1
ablest	1
defence	1
of	1
your	1
favourite	1
maxim,	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
can	1
ever	1
be	1
in	1
love	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
in	1
their	1
life--your	1
opinion	1
on	1
that	1
point	1
is	1
unchanged,	1
I	1
presume?"	1
"Undoubtedly.	1
At	1
my	1
time	1
of	1
life	1
opinions	1
are	1
tolerably	1
fixed.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
likely	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
now	1
see	1
or	1
hear	1
any	1
thing	1
to	1
change	1
them."	1
"Marianne	1
is	1
as	1
steadfast	1
as	1
ever,	1
you	1
see,"	1
said	1
Elinor,	1
"she	1
is	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
altered."	1
"She	1
is	1
only	1
grown	1
a	1
little	1
more	1
grave	1
than	1
she	1
was."	1
"Nay,	1
Edward,"	1
said	1
Marianne,	1
"you	1
need	1
not	1
reproach	1
me.	1
You	1
are	1
not	1
very	1
gay	1
yourself."	1
"Why	1
should	1
you	1
think	1
so!"	1
replied	1
he,	1
with	1
a	1
sigh.	1
"But	1
gaiety	1
never	1
was	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
MY	1
character."	1
"Nor	1
do	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
Marianne's,"	1
said	1
Elinor;	1
"I	1
should	1
hardly	1
call	1
her	1
a	1
lively	1
girl--she	1
is	1
very	1
earnest,	1
very	1
eager	1
in	1
all	1
she	1
does--sometimes	1
talks	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
and	1
always	1
with	1
animation--but	1
she	1
is	1
not	1
often	1
really	1
merry."	1
"I	1
believe	1
you	1
are	1
right,"	1
he	1
replied,	1
"and	1
yet	1
I	1
have	1
always	1
set	1
her	1
down	1
as	1
a	1
lively	1
girl."	1
"I	1
have	1
frequently	1
detected	1
myself	1
in	1
such	1
kind	1
of	1
mistakes,"	1
said	1
Elinor,	1
"in	1
a	1
total	1
misapprehension	1
of	1
character	1
in	1
some	1
point	1
or	1
other:	1
fancying	1
people	1
so	1
much	1
more	1
gay	1
or	1
grave,	1
or	1
ingenious	1
or	1
stupid	1
than	1
they	1
really	1
are,	1
and	1
I	1
can	1
hardly	1
tell	1
why	1
or	1
in	1
what	1
the	1
deception	1
originated.	1
Sometimes	1
one	1
is	1
guided	1
by	1
what	1
they	1
say	1
of	1
themselves,	1
and	1
very	1
frequently	1
by	1
what	1
other	1
people	1
say	1
of	1
them,	1
without	1
giving	1
oneself	1
time	1
to	1
deliberate	1
and	1
judge."	1
"But	1
I	1
thought	1
it	1
was	1
right,	1
Elinor,"	1
said	1
Marianne,	1
"to	1
be	1
guided	1
wholly	1
by	1
the	1
opinion	1
of	1
other	1
people.	1
I	1
thought	1
our	1
judgments	1
were	1
given	1
us	1
merely	1
to	1
be	1
subservient	1
to	1
those	1
of	1
neighbours.	1
This	1
has	1
always	1
been	1
your	1
doctrine,	1
I	1
am	1
sure."	1
"No,	1
Marianne,	1
never.	1
My	1
doctrine	1
has	1
never	1
aimed	1
at	1
the	1
subjection	1
of	1
the	1
understanding.	1
All	1
I	1
have	1
ever	1
attempted	1
to	1
influence	1
has	1
been	1
the	1
behaviour.	1
You	1
must	1
not	1
confound	1
my	1
meaning.	1
I	1
am	1
guilty,	1
I	1
confess,	1
of	1
having	1
often	1
wished	1
you	1
to	1
treat	1
our	1
acquaintance	1
in	1
general	1
with	1
greater	1
attention;	1
but	1
when	1
have	1
I	1
advised	1
you	1
to	1
adopt	1
their	1
sentiments	1
or	1
to	1
conform	1
to	1
their	1
judgment	1
in	1
serious	1
matters?"	1
"You	1
have	1
not	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
bring	1
your	1
sister	1
over	1
to	1
your	1
plan	1
of	1
general	1
civility,"	1
said	1
Edward	1
to	1
Elinor,	1
"Do	1
you	1
gain	1
no	1
ground?"	1
"Quite	1
the	1
contrary,"	1
replied	1
Elinor,	1
looking	1
expressively	1
at	1
Marianne.	1
"My	1
judgment,"	1
he	1
returned,	1
"is	1
all	1
on	1
your	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
question;	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
my	1
practice	1
is	1
much	1
more	1
on	1
your	1
sister's.	1
I	1
never	1
wish	1
to	1
offend,	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
so	1
foolishly	1
shy,	1
that	1
I	1
often	1
seem	1
negligent,	1
when	1
I	1
am	1
only	1
kept	1
back	1
by	1
my	1
natural	1
awkwardness.	1
I	1
have	1
frequently	1
thought	1
that	1
I	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
intended	1
by	1
nature	1
to	1
be	1
fond	1
of	1
low	1
company,	1
I	1
am	1
so	1
little	1
at	1
my	1
ease	1
among	1
strangers	1
of	1
gentility!"	1
"Marianne	1
has	1
not	1
shyness	1
to	1
excuse	1
any	1
inattention	1
of	1
hers,"	1
said	1
Elinor.	1
"She	1
knows	1
her	1
own	1
worth	1
too	1
well	1
for	1
false	1
shame,"	1
replied	1
Edward.	1
"Shyness	1
is	1
only	1
the	1
effect	1
of	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
inferiority	1
in	1
some	1
way	1
or	1
other.	1
If	1
I	1
could	1
persuade	1
myself	1
that	1
my	1
manners	1
were	1
perfectly	1
easy	1
and	1
graceful,	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
shy."	1
"But	1
you	1
would	1
still	1
be	1
reserved,"	1
said	1
Marianne,	1
"and	1
that	1
is	1
worse."	1
Edward	1
started--"Reserved!	1
Am	1
I	1
reserved,	1
Marianne?"	1
"Yes,	1
very."	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
understand	1
you,"	1
replied	1
he,	1
colouring.	1
"Reserved!--how,	1
in	1
what	1
manner?	1
What	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
tell	1
you?	1
What	1
can	1
you	1
suppose?"	1
Elinor	1
looked	1
surprised	1
at	1
his	1
emotion;	1
but	1
trying	1
to	1
laugh	1
off	1
the	1
subject,	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
"Do	1
not	1
you	1
know	1
my	1
sister	1
well	1
enough	1
to	1
understand	1
what	1
she	1
means?	1
Do	1
not	1
you	1
know	1
she	1
calls	1
every	1
one	1
reserved	1
who	1
does	1
not	1
talk	1
as	1
fast,	1
and	1
admire	1
what	1
she	1
admires	1
as	1
rapturously	1
as	1
herself?"	1
Edward	1
made	1
no	1
answer.	1
His	1
gravity	1
and	1
thoughtfulness	1
returned	1
on	1
him	1
in	1
their	1
fullest	1
extent--and	1
he	1
sat	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
silent	1
and	1
dull.	1
CHAPTER	1
18	1
Elinor	1
saw,	1
with	1
great	1
uneasiness	1
the	1
low	1
spirits	1
of	1
her	1
friend.	1
His	1
visit	1
afforded	1
her	1
but	1
a	1
very	1
partial	1
satisfaction,	1
while	1
his	1
own	1
enjoyment	1
in	1
it	1
appeared	1
so	1
imperfect.	1
It	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
unhappy;	1
she	1
wished	1
it	1
were	1
equally	1
evident	1
that	1
he	1
still	1
distinguished	1
her	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
affection	1
which	1
once	1
she	1
had	1
felt	1
no	1
doubt	1
of	1
inspiring;	1
but	1
hitherto	1
the	1
continuance	1
of	1
his	1
preference	1
seemed	1
very	1
uncertain;	1
and	1
the	1
reservedness	1
of	1
his	1
manner	1
towards	1
her	1
contradicted	1
one	1
moment	1
what	1
a	1
more	1
animated	1
look	1
had	1
intimated	1
the	1
preceding	1
one.	1
He	1
joined	1
her	1
and	1
Marianne	1
in	1
the	1
breakfast-room	1
the	1
next	1
morning	1
before	1
the	1
others	1
were	1
down;	1
and	1
Marianne,	1
who	1
was	1
always	1
eager	1
to	1
promote	1
their	1
happiness	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
she	1
could,	1
soon	1
left	1
them	1
to	1
themselves.	1
But	1
before	1
she	1
was	1
half	1
way	1
upstairs	1
she	1
heard	1
the	1
parlour	1
door	1
open,	1
and,	1
turning	1
round,	1
was	1
astonished	1
to	1
see	1
Edward	1
himself	1
come	1
out.	1
"I	1
am	1
going	1
into	1
the	1
village	1
to	1
see	1
my	1
horses,"	1
said	1
be,	1
"as	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
yet	1
ready	1
for	1
breakfast;	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
back	1
again	1
presently."	1
***	1
Edward	1
returned	1
to	1
them	1
with	1
fresh	1
admiration	1
of	1
the	1
surrounding	1
country;	1
in	1
his	1
walk	1
to	1
the	1
village,	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
many	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
valley	1
to	1
advantage;	1
and	1
the	1
village	1
itself,	1
in	1
a	1
much	1
higher	1
situation	1
than	1
the	1
cottage,	1
afforded	1
a	1
general	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
whole,	1
which	1
had	1
exceedingly	1
pleased	1
him.	1
This	1
was	1
a	1
subject	1
which	1
ensured	1
Marianne's	1
attention,	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
beginning	1
to	1
describe	1
her	1
own	1
admiration	1
of	1
these	1
scenes,	1
and	1
to	1
question	1
him	1
more	1
minutely	1
on	1
the	1
objects	1
that	1
had	1
particularly	1
struck	1
him,	1
when	1
Edward	1
interrupted	1
her	1
by	1
saying,	1
"You	1
must	1
not	1
enquire	1
too	1
far,	1
Marianne--remember	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
knowledge	1
in	1
the	1
picturesque,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
offend	1
you	1
by	1
my	1
ignorance	1
and	1
want	1
of	1
taste	1
if	1
we	1
come	1
to	1
particulars.	1
I	1
shall	1
call	1
hills	1
steep,	1
which	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
bold;	1
surfaces	1
strange	1
and	1
uncouth,	1
which	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
irregular	1
and	1
rugged;	1
and	1
distant	1
objects	1
out	1
of	1
sight,	1
which	1
ought	1
only	1
to	1
be	1
indistinct	1
through	1
the	1
soft	1
medium	1
of	1
a	1
hazy	1
atmosphere.	1
You	1
must	1
be	1
satisfied	1
with	1
such	1
admiration	1
as	1
I	1
can	1
honestly	1
give.	1
I	1
call	1
it	1
a	1
very	1
fine	1
country--the	1
hills	1
are	1
steep,	1
the	1
woods	1
seem	1
full	1
of	1
fine	1
timber,	1
and	1
the	1
valley	1
looks	1
comfortable	1
and	1
snug--with	1
rich	1
meadows	1
and	1
several	1
neat	1
farm	1
houses	1
scattered	1
here	1
and	1
there.	1
It	1
exactly	1
answers	1
my	1
idea	1
of	1
a	1
fine	1
country,	1
because	1
it	1
unites	1
beauty	1
with	1
utility--and	1
I	1
dare	1
say	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
picturesque	1
one	1
too,	1
because	1
you	1
admire	1
it;	1
I	1
can	1
easily	1
believe	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
full	1
of	1
rocks	1
and	1
promontories,	1
grey	1
moss	1
and	1
brush	1
wood,	1
but	1
these	1
are	1
all	1
lost	1
on	1
me.	1
I	1
know	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
picturesque."	1
"I	1
am	1
afraid	1
it	1
is	1
but	1
too	1
true,"	1
said	1
Marianne;	1
"but	1
why	1
should	1
you	1
boast	1
of	1
it?"	1
"I	1
suspect,"	1
said	1
Elinor,	1
"that	1
to	1
avoid	1
one	1
kind	1
of	1
affectation,	1
Edward	1
here	1
falls	1
into	1
another.	1
Because	1
he	1
believes	1
many	1
people	1
pretend	1
to	1
more	1
admiration	1
of	1
the	1
beauties	1
of	1
nature	1
than	1
they	1
really	1
feel,	1
and	1
is	1
disgusted	1
with	1
such	1
pretensions,	1
he	1
affects	1
greater	1
indifference	1
and	1
less	1
discrimination	1
in	1
viewing	1
them	1
himself	1
than	1
he	1
possesses.	1
He	1
is	1
fastidious	1
and	1
will	1
have	1
an	1
affectation	1
of	1
his	1
own."	1
"It	1
is	1
very	1
true,"	1
said	1
Marianne,	1
"that	1
admiration	1
of	1
landscape	1
scenery	1
is	1
become	1
a	1
mere	1
jargon.	1
Every	1
body	1
pretends	1
to	1
feel	1
and	1
tries	1
to	1
describe	1
with	1
the	1
taste	1
and	1
elegance	1
of	1
him	1
who	1
first	1
defined	1
what	1
picturesque	1
beauty	1
was.	1
I	1
detest	1
jargon	1
of	1
every	1
kind,	1
and	1
sometimes	1
I	1
have	1
kept	1
my	1
feelings	1
to	1
myself,	1
because	1
I	1
could	1
find	1
no	1
language	1
to	1
describe	1
them	1
in	1
but	1
what	1
was	1
worn	1
and	1
hackneyed	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
sense	1
and	1
meaning."	1
"I	1
am	1
convinced,"	1
said	1
Edward,	1
"that	1
you	1
really	1
feel	1
all	1
the	1
delight	1
in	1
a	1
fine	1
prospect	1
which	1
you	1
profess	1
to	1
feel.	1
But,	1
in	1
return,	1
your	1
sister	1
must	1
allow	1
me	1
to	1
feel	1
no	1
more	1
than	1
I	1
profess.	1
I	1
like	1
a	1
fine	1
prospect,	1
but	1
not	1
on	1
picturesque	1
principles.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
like	1
crooked,	1
twisted,	1
blasted	1
trees.	1
I	1
admire	1
them	1
much	1
more	1
if	1
they	1
are	1
tall,	1
straight,	1
and	1
flourishing.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
like	1
ruined,	1
tattered	1
cottages.	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
fond	1
of	1
nettles	1
or	1
thistles,	1
or	1
heath	1
blossoms.	1
I	1
have	1
more	1
pleasure	1
in	1
a	1
snug	1
farm-house	1
than	1
a	1
watch-tower--and	1
a	1
troop	1
of	1
tidy,	1
happy	1
villages	1
please	1
me	1
better	1
than	1
the	1
finest	1
banditti	1
in	1
the	1
world."	1
Marianne	1
looked	1
with	1
amazement	1
at	1
Edward,	1
with	1
compassion	1
at	1
her	1
sister.	1
Elinor	1
only	1
laughed.	1
The	1
subject	1
was	1
continued	1
no	1
farther;	1
and	1
Marianne	1
remained	1
thoughtfully	1
silent,	1
till	1
a	1
new	1
object	1
suddenly	1
engaged	1
her	1
attention.	1
She	1
was	1
sitting	1
by	1
Edward,	1
and	1
in	1
taking	1
his	1
tea	1
from	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood,	1
his	1
hand	1
passed	1
so	1
directly	1
before	1
her,	1
as	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
ring,	1
with	1
a	1
plait	1
of	1
hair	1
in	1
the	1
centre,	1
very	1
conspicuous	1
on	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
fingers.	1
"I	1
never	1
saw	1
you	1
wear	1
a	1
ring	1
before,	1
Edward,"	1
she	1
cried.	1
"Is	1
that	1
Fanny's	1
hair?	1
I	1
remember	1
her	1
promising	1
to	1
give	1
you	1
some.	1
But	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
thought	1
her	1
hair	1
had	1
been	1
darker."	1
Marianne	1
spoke	1
inconsiderately	1
what	1
she	1
really	1
felt--	1
but	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
how	1
much	1
she	1
had	1
pained	1
Edward,	1
her	1
own	1
vexation	1
at	1
her	1
want	1
of	1
thought	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
surpassed	1
by	1
his.	1
He	1
coloured	1
very	1
deeply,	1
and	1
giving	1
a	1
momentary	1
glance	1
at	1
Elinor,	1
replied,	1
"Yes;	1
it	1
is	1
my	1
sister's	1
hair.	1
The	1
setting	1
always	1
casts	1
a	1
different	1
shade	1
on	1
it,	1
you	1
know."	1
Elinor	1
had	1
met	1
his	1
eye,	1
and	1
looked	1
conscious	1
likewise.	1
That	1
the	1
hair	1
was	1
her	1
own,	1
she	1
instantaneously	1
felt	1
as	1
well	1
satisfied	1
as	1
Marianne;	1
the	1
only	1
difference	1
in	1
their	1
conclusions	1
was,	1
that	1
what	1
Marianne	1
considered	1
as	1
a	1
free	1
gift	1
from	1
her	1
sister,	1
Elinor	1
was	1
conscious	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
procured	1
by	1
some	1
theft	1
or	1
contrivance	1
unknown	1
to	1
herself.	1
She	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
a	1
humour,	1
however,	1
to	1
regard	1
it	1
as	1
an	1
affront,	1
and	1
affecting	1
to	1
take	1
no	1
notice	1
of	1
what	1
passed,	1
by	1
instantly	1
talking	1
of	1
something	1
else,	1
she	1
internally	1
resolved	1
henceforward	1
to	1
catch	1
every	1
opportunity	1
of	1
eyeing	1
the	1
hair	1
and	1
of	1
satisfying	1
herself,	1
beyond	1
all	1
doubt,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
exactly	1
the	1
shade	1
of	1
her	1
own.	1
Edward's	1
embarrassment	1
lasted	1
some	1
time,	1
and	1
it	1
ended	1
in	1
an	1
absence	1
of	1
mind	1
still	1
more	1
settled.	1
He	1
was	1
particularly	1
grave	1
the	1
whole	1
morning.	1
Marianne	1
severely	1
censured	1
herself	1
for	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
said;	1
but	1
her	1
own	1
forgiveness	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
more	1
speedy,	1
had	1
she	1
known	1
how	1
little	1
offence	1
it	1
had	1
given	1
her	1
sister.	1
Before	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
day,	1
they	1
were	1
visited	1
by	1
Sir	1
John	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings,	1
who,	1
having	1
heard	1
of	1
the	1
arrival	1
of	1
a	1
gentleman	1
at	1
the	1
cottage,	1
came	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
survey	1
of	1
the	1
guest.	1
With	1
the	1
assistance	1
of	1
his	1
mother-in-law,	1
Sir	1
John	1
was	1
not	1
long	1
in	1
discovering	1
that	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Ferrars	1
began	1
with	1
an	1
F.	1
and	1
this	1
prepared	1
a	1
future	1
mine	1
of	1
raillery	1
against	1
the	1
devoted	1
Elinor,	1
which	1
nothing	1
but	1
the	1
newness	1
of	1
their	1
acquaintance	1
with	1
Edward	1
could	1
have	1
prevented	1
from	1
being	1
immediately	1
sprung.	1
But,	1
as	1
it	1
was,	1
she	1
only	1
learned,	1
from	1
some	1
very	1
significant	1
looks,	1
how	1
far	1
their	1
penetration,	1
founded	1
on	1
Margaret's	1
instructions,	1
extended.	1
Sir	1
John	1
never	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
Dashwoods	1
without	1
either	1
inviting	1
them	1
to	1
dine	1
at	1
the	1
park	1
the	1
next	1
day,	1
or	1
to	1
drink	1
tea	1
with	1
them	1
that	1
evening.	1
On	1
the	1
present	1
occasion,	1
for	1
the	1
better	1
entertainment	1
of	1
their	1
visitor,	1
towards	1
whose	1
amusement	1
he	1
felt	1
himself	1
bound	1
to	1
contribute,	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
engage	1
them	1
for	1
both.	1
"You	1
MUST	1
drink	1
tea	1
with	1
us	1
to	1
night,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"for	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
quite	1
alone--and	1
tomorrow	1
you	1
must	1
absolutely	1
dine	1
with	1
us,	1
for	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
large	1
party."	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
enforced	1
the	1
necessity.	1
"And	1
who	1
knows	1
but	1
you	1
may	1
raise	1
a	1
dance,"	1
said	1
she.	1
"And	1
that	1
will	1
tempt	1
YOU,	1
Miss	1
Marianne."	1
"A	1
dance!"	1
cried	1
Marianne.	1
"Impossible!	1
Who	1
is	1
to	1
dance?"	1
"Who!	1
why	1
yourselves,	1
and	1
the	1
Careys,	1
and	1
Whitakers	1
to	1
be	1
sure.--What!	1
you	1
thought	1
nobody	1
could	1
dance	1
because	1
a	1
certain	1
person	1
that	1
shall	1
be	1
nameless	1
is	1
gone!"	1
"I	1
wish	1
with	1
all	1
my	1
soul,"	1
cried	1
Sir	1
John,	1
"that	1
Willoughby	1
were	1
among	1
us	1
again."	1
This,	1
and	1
Marianne's	1
blushing,	1
gave	1
new	1
suspicions	1
to	1
Edward.	1
"And	1
who	1
is	1
Willoughby?"	1
said	1
he,	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice,	1
to	1
Miss	1
Dashwood,	1
by	1
whom	1
he	1
was	1
sitting.	1
She	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
brief	1
reply.	1
Marianne's	1
countenance	1
was	1
more	1
communicative.	1
Edward	1
saw	1
enough	1
to	1
comprehend,	1
not	1
only	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
others,	1
but	1
such	1
of	1
Marianne's	1
expressions	1
as	1
had	1
puzzled	1
him	1
before;	1
and	1
when	1
their	1
visitors	1
left	1
them,	1
he	1
went	1
immediately	1
round	1
her,	1
and	1
said,	1
in	1
a	1
whisper,	1
"I	1
have	1
been	1
guessing.	1
Shall	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
my	1
guess?"	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
mean?"	1
"Shall	1
I	1
tell	1
you."	1
"Certainly."	1
"Well	1
then;	1
I	1
guess	1
that	1
Mr.	1
Willoughby	1
hunts."	1
Marianne	1
was	1
surprised	1
and	1
confused,	1
yet	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
smiling	1
at	1
the	1
quiet	1
archness	1
of	1
his	1
manner,	1
and	1
after	1
a	1
moment's	1
silence,	1
said,	1
"Oh,	1
Edward!	1
How	1
can	1
you?--But	1
the	1
time	1
will	1
come	1
I	1
hope...I	1
am	1
sure	1
you	1
will	1
like	1
him."	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
doubt	1
it,"	1
replied	1
he,	1
rather	1
astonished	1
at	1
her	1
earnestness	1
and	1
warmth;	1
for	1
had	1
he	1
not	1
imagined	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
joke	1
for	1
the	1
good	1
of	1
her	1
acquaintance	1
in	1
general,	1
founded	1
only	1
on	1
a	1
something	1
or	1
a	1
nothing	1
between	1
Mr.	1
Willoughby	1
and	1
herself,	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
ventured	1
to	1
mention	1
it.	1
CHAPTER	1
19	1
Edward	1
remained	1
a	1
week	1
at	1
the	1
cottage;	1
he	1
was	1
earnestly	1
pressed	1
by	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood	1
to	1
stay	1
longer;	1
but,	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
bent	1
only	1
on	1
self-mortification,	1
he	1
seemed	1
resolved	1
to	1
be	1
gone	1
when	1
his	1
enjoyment	1
among	1
his	1
friends	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
height.	1
His	1
spirits,	1
during	1
the	1
last	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
days,	1
though	1
still	1
very	1
unequal,	1
were	1
greatly	1
improved--he	1
grew	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
partial	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
environs--never	1
spoke	1
of	1
going	1
away	1
without	1
a	1
sigh--declared	1
his	1
time	1
to	1
be	1
wholly	1
disengaged--even	1
doubted	1
to	1
what	1
place	1
he	1
should	1
go	1
when	1
he	1
left	1
them--but	1
still,	1
go	1
he	1
must.	1
Never	1
had	1
any	1
week	1
passed	1
so	1
quickly--he	1
could	1
hardly	1
believe	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
gone.	1
He	1
said	1
so	1
repeatedly;	1
other	1
things	1
he	1
said	1
too,	1
which	1
marked	1
the	1
turn	1
of	1
his	1
feelings	1
and	1
gave	1
the	1
lie	1
to	1
his	1
actions.	1
He	1
had	1
no	1
pleasure	1
at	1
Norland;	1
he	1
detested	1
being	1
in	1
town;	1
but	1
either	1
to	1
Norland	1
or	1
London,	1
he	1
must	1
go.	1
He	1
valued	1
their	1
kindness	1
beyond	1
any	1
thing,	1
and	1
his	1
greatest	1
happiness	1
was	1
in	1
being	1
with	1
them.	1
Yet,	1
he	1
must	1
leave	1
them	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
a	1
week,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
their	1
wishes	1
and	1
his	1
own,	1
and	1
without	1
any	1
restraint	1
on	1
his	1
time.	1
Elinor	1
placed	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
astonishing	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
of	1
acting	1
to	1
his	1
mother's	1
account;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
happy	1
for	1
her	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
mother	1
whose	1
character	1
was	1
so	1
imperfectly	1
known	1
to	1
her,	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
general	1
excuse	1
for	1
every	1
thing	1
strange	1
on	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
her	1
son.	1
Disappointed,	1
however,	1
and	1
vexed	1
as	1
she	1
was,	1
and	1
sometimes	1
displeased	1
with	1
his	1
uncertain	1
behaviour	1
to	1
herself,	1
she	1
was	1
very	1
well	1
disposed	1
on	1
the	1
whole	1
to	1
regard	1
his	1
actions	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
candid	1
allowances	1
and	1
generous	1
qualifications,	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
rather	1
more	1
painfully	1
extorted	1
from	1
her,	1
for	1
Willoughby's	1
service,	1
by	1
her	1
mother.	1
His	1
want	1
of	1
spirits,	1
of	1
openness,	1
and	1
of	1
consistency,	1
were	1
most	1
usually	1
attributed	1
to	1
his	1
want	1
of	1
independence,	1
and	1
his	1
better	1
knowledge	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
Ferrars's	1
disposition	1
and	1
designs.	1
The	1
shortness	1
of	1
his	1
visit,	1
the	1
steadiness	1
of	1
his	1
purpose	1
in	1
leaving	1
them,	1
originated	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
fettered	1
inclination,	1
the	1
same	1
inevitable	1
necessity	1
of	1
temporizing	1
with	1
his	1
mother.	1
The	1
old	1
well-established	1
grievance	1
of	1
duty	1
against	1
will,	1
parent	1
against	1
child,	1
was	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
all.	1
She	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
glad	1
to	1
know	1
when	1
these	1
difficulties	1
were	1
to	1
cease,	1
this	1
opposition	1
was	1
to	1
yield,--when	1
Mrs.	1
Ferrars	1
would	1
be	1
reformed,	1
and	1
her	1
son	1
be	1
at	1
liberty	1
to	1
be	1
happy.	1
But	1
from	1
such	1
vain	1
wishes	1
she	1
was	1
forced	1
to	1
turn	1
for	1
comfort	1
to	1
the	1
renewal	1
of	1
her	1
confidence	1
in	1
Edward's	1
affection,	1
to	1
the	1
remembrance	1
of	1
every	1
mark	1
of	1
regard	1
in	1
look	1
or	1
word	1
which	1
fell	1
from	1
him	1
while	1
at	1
Barton,	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
to	1
that	1
flattering	1
proof	1
of	1
it	1
which	1
he	1
constantly	1
wore	1
round	1
his	1
finger.	1
"I	1
think,	1
Edward,"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood,	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
at	1
breakfast	1
the	1
last	1
morning,	1
"you	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
happier	1
man	1
if	1
you	1
had	1
any	1
profession	1
to	1
engage	1
your	1
time	1
and	1
give	1
an	1
interest	1
to	1
your	1
plans	1
and	1
actions.	1
Some	1
inconvenience	1
to	1
your	1
friends,	1
indeed,	1
might	1
result	1
from	1
it--you	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
give	1
them	1
so	1
much	1
of	1
your	1
time.	1
But	1
(with	1
a	1
smile)	1
you	1
would	1
be	1
materially	1
benefited	1
in	1
one	1
particular	1
at	1
least--you	1
would	1
know	1
where	1
to	1
go	1
when	1
you	1
left	1
them."	1
"I	1
do	1
assure	1
you,"	1
he	1
replied,	1
"that	1
I	1
have	1
long	1
thought	1
on	1
this	1
point,	1
as	1
you	1
think	1
now.	1
It	1
has	1
been,	1
and	1
is,	1
and	1
probably	1
will	1
always	1
be	1
a	1
heavy	1
misfortune	1
to	1
me,	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
no	1
necessary	1
business	1
to	1
engage	1
me,	1
no	1
profession	1
to	1
give	1
me	1
employment,	1
or	1
afford	1
me	1
any	1
thing	1
like	1
independence.	1
But	1
unfortunately	1
my	1
own	1
nicety,	1
and	1
the	1
nicety	1
of	1
my	1
friends,	1
have	1
made	1
me	1
what	1
I	1
am,	1
an	1
idle,	1
helpless	1
being.	1
We	1
never	1
could	1
agree	1
in	1
our	1
choice	1
of	1
a	1
profession.	1
I	1
always	1
preferred	1
the	1
church,	1
as	1
I	1
still	1
do.	1
But	1
that	1
was	1
not	1
smart	1
enough	1
for	1
my	1
family.	1
They	1
recommended	1
the	1
army.	1
That	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
too	1
smart	1
for	1
me.	1
The	1
law	1
was	1
allowed	1
to	1
be	1
genteel	1
enough;	1
many	1
young	1
men,	1
who	1
had	1
chambers	1
in	1
the	1
Temple,	1
made	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
appearance	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
circles,	1
and	1
drove	1
about	1
town	1
in	1
very	1
knowing	1
gigs.	1
But	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
inclination	1
for	1
the	1
law,	1
even	1
in	1
this	1
less	1
abstruse	1
study	1
of	1
it,	1
which	1
my	1
family	1
approved.	1
As	1
for	1
the	1
navy,	1
it	1
had	1
fashion	1
on	1
its	1
side,	1
but	1
I	1
was	1
too	1
old	1
when	1
the	1
subject	1
was	1
first	1
started	1
to	1
enter	1
it--and,	1
at	1
length,	1
as	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
necessity	1
for	1
my	1
having	1
any	1
profession	1
at	1
all,	1
as	1
I	1
might	1
be	1
as	1
dashing	1
and	1
expensive	1
without	1
a	1
red	1
coat	1
on	1
my	1
back	1
as	1
with	1
one,	1
idleness	1
was	1
pronounced	1
on	1
the	1
whole	1
to	1
be	1
most	1
advantageous	1
and	1
honourable,	1
and	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
of	1
eighteen	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
general	1
so	1
earnestly	1
bent	1
on	1
being	1
busy	1
as	1
to	1
resist	1
the	1
solicitations	1
of	1
his	1
friends	1
to	1
do	1
nothing.	1
I	1
was	1
therefore	1
entered	1
at	1
Oxford	1
and	1
have	1
been	1
properly	1
idle	1
ever	1
since."	1
"The	1
consequence	1
of	1
which,	1
I	1
suppose,	1
will	1
be,"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood,	1
"since	1
leisure	1
has	1
not	1
promoted	1
your	1
own	1
happiness,	1
that	1
your	1
sons	1
will	1
be	1
brought	1
up	1
to	1
as	1
many	1
pursuits,	1
employments,	1
professions,	1
and	1
trades	1
as	1
Columella's."	1
"They	1
will	1
be	1
brought	1
up,"	1
said	1
he,	1
in	1
a	1
serious	1
accent,	1
"to	1
be	1
as	1
unlike	1
myself	1
as	1
is	1
possible.	1
In	1
feeling,	1
in	1
action,	1
in	1
condition,	1
in	1
every	1
thing."	1
"Come,	1
come;	1
this	1
is	1
all	1
an	1
effusion	1
of	1
immediate	1
want	1
of	1
spirits,	1
Edward.	1
You	1
are	1
in	1
a	1
melancholy	1
humour,	1
and	1
fancy	1
that	1
any	1
one	1
unlike	1
yourself	1
must	1
be	1
happy.	1
But	1
remember	1
that	1
the	1
pain	1
of	1
parting	1
from	1
friends	1
will	1
be	1
felt	1
by	1
every	1
body	1
at	1
times,	1
whatever	1
be	1
their	1
education	1
or	1
state.	1
Know	1
your	1
own	1
happiness.	1
You	1
want	1
nothing	1
but	1
patience--or	1
give	1
it	1
a	1
more	1
fascinating	1
name,	1
call	1
it	1
hope.	1
Your	1
mother	1
will	1
secure	1
to	1
you,	1
in	1
time,	1
that	1
independence	1
you	1
are	1
so	1
anxious	1
for;	1
it	1
is	1
her	1
duty,	1
and	1
it	1
will,	1
it	1
must	1
ere	1
long	1
become	1
her	1
happiness	1
to	1
prevent	1
your	1
whole	1
youth	1
from	1
being	1
wasted	1
in	1
discontent.	1
How	1
much	1
may	1
not	1
a	1
few	1
months	1
do?"	1
"I	1
think,"	1
replied	1
Edward,	1
"that	1
I	1
may	1
defy	1
many	1
months	1
to	1
produce	1
any	1
good	1
to	1
me."	1
This	1
desponding	1
turn	1
of	1
mind,	1
though	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
communicated	1
to	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood,	1
gave	1
additional	1
pain	1
to	1
them	1
all	1
in	1
the	1
parting,	1
which	1
shortly	1
took	1
place,	1
and	1
left	1
an	1
uncomfortable	1
impression	1
on	1
Elinor's	1
feelings	1
especially,	1
which	1
required	1
some	1
trouble	1
and	1
time	1
to	1
subdue.	1
But	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
her	1
determination	1
to	1
subdue	1
it,	1
and	1
to	1
prevent	1
herself	1
from	1
appearing	1
to	1
suffer	1
more	1
than	1
what	1
all	1
her	1
family	1
suffered	1
on	1
his	1
going	1
away,	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
adopt	1
the	1
method	1
so	1
judiciously	1
employed	1
by	1
Marianne,	1
on	1
a	1
similar	1
occasion,	1
to	1
augment	1
and	1
fix	1
her	1
sorrow,	1
by	1
seeking	1
silence,	1
solitude	1
and	1
idleness.	1
Their	1
means	1
were	1
as	1
different	1
as	1
their	1
objects,	1
and	1
equally	1
suited	1
to	1
the	1
advancement	1
of	1
each.	1
Elinor	1
sat	1
down	1
to	1
her	1
drawing-table	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
busily	1
employed	1
herself	1
the	1
whole	1
day,	1
neither	1
sought	1
nor	1
avoided	1
the	1
mention	1
of	1
his	1
name,	1
appeared	1
to	1
interest	1
herself	1
almost	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
ever	1
in	1
the	1
general	1
concerns	1
of	1
the	1
family,	1
and	1
if,	1
by	1
this	1
conduct,	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
lessen	1
her	1
own	1
grief,	1
it	1
was	1
at	1
least	1
prevented	1
from	1
unnecessary	1
increase,	1
and	1
her	1
mother	1
and	1
sisters	1
were	1
spared	1
much	1
solicitude	1
on	1
her	1
account.	1
Such	1
behaviour	1
as	1
this,	1
so	1
exactly	1
the	1
reverse	1
of	1
her	1
own,	1
appeared	1
no	1
more	1
meritorious	1
to	1
Marianne,	1
than	1
her	1
own	1
had	1
seemed	1
faulty	1
to	1
her.	1
The	1
business	1
of	1
self-command	1
she	1
settled	1
very	1
easily;--with	1
strong	1
affections	1
it	1
was	1
impossible,	1
with	1
calm	1
ones	1
it	1
could	1
have	1
no	1
merit.	1
That	1
her	1
sister's	1
affections	1
WERE	1
calm,	1
she	1
dared	1
not	1
deny,	1
though	1
she	1
blushed	1
to	1
acknowledge	1
it;	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
her	1
own,	1
she	1
gave	1
a	1
very	1
striking	1
proof,	1
by	1
still	1
loving	1
and	1
respecting	1
that	1
sister,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
this	1
mortifying	1
conviction.	1
Without	1
shutting	1
herself	1
up	1
from	1
her	1
family,	1
or	1
leaving	1
the	1
house	1
in	1
determined	1
solitude	1
to	1
avoid	1
them,	1
or	1
lying	1
awake	1
the	1
whole	1
night	1
to	1
indulge	1
meditation,	1
Elinor	1
found	1
every	1
day	1
afforded	1
her	1
leisure	1
enough	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
Edward,	1
and	1
of	1
Edward's	1
behaviour,	1
in	1
every	1
possible	1
variety	1
which	1
the	1
different	1
state	1
of	1
her	1
spirits	1
at	1
different	1
times	1
could	1
produce,--with	1
tenderness,	1
pity,	1
approbation,	1
censure,	1
and	1
doubt.	1
There	1
were	1
moments	1
in	1
abundance,	1
when,	1
if	1
not	1
by	1
the	1
absence	1
of	1
her	1
mother	1
and	1
sisters,	1
at	1
least	1
by	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
their	1
employments,	1
conversation	1
was	1
forbidden	1
among	1
them,	1
and	1
every	1
effect	1
of	1
solitude	1
was	1
produced.	1
Her	1
mind	1
was	1
inevitably	1
at	1
liberty;	1
her	1
thoughts	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
chained	1
elsewhere;	1
and	1
the	1
past	1
and	1
the	1
future,	1
on	1
a	1
subject	1
so	1
interesting,	1
must	1
be	1
before	1
her,	1
must	1
force	1
her	1
attention,	1
and	1
engross	1
her	1
memory,	1
her	1
reflection,	1
and	1
her	1
fancy.	1
From	1
a	1
reverie	1
of	1
this	1
kind,	1
as	1
she	1
sat	1
at	1
her	1
drawing-table,	1
she	1
was	1
roused	1
one	1
morning,	1
soon	1
after	1
Edward's	1
leaving	1
them,	1
by	1
the	1
arrival	1
of	1
company.	1
She	1
happened	1
to	1
be	1
quite	1
alone.	1
The	1
closing	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
gate,	1
at	1
the	1
entrance	1
of	1
the	1
green	1
court	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
drew	1
her	1
eyes	1
to	1
the	1
window,	1
and	1
she	1
saw	1
a	1
large	1
party	1
walking	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
door.	1
Amongst	1
them	1
were	1
Sir	1
John	1
and	1
Lady	1
Middleton	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings,	1
but	1
there	1
were	1
two	1
others,	1
a	1
gentleman	1
and	1
lady,	1
who	1
were	1
quite	1
unknown	1
to	1
her.	1
She	1
was	1
sitting	1
near	1
the	1
window,	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
Sir	1
John	1
perceived	1
her,	1
he	1
left	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
party	1
to	1
the	1
ceremony	1
of	1
knocking	1
at	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
stepping	1
across	1
the	1
turf,	1
obliged	1
her	1
to	1
open	1
the	1
casement	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
him,	1
though	1
the	1
space	1
was	1
so	1
short	1
between	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
the	1
window,	1
as	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
hardly	1
possible	1
to	1
speak	1
at	1
one	1
without	1
being	1
heard	1
at	1
the	1
other.	1
"Well,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"we	1
have	1
brought	1
you	1
some	1
strangers.	1
How	1
do	1
you	1
like	1
them?"	1
"Hush!	1
they	1
will	1
hear	1
you."	1
"Never	1
mind	1
if	1
they	1
do.	1
It	1
is	1
only	1
the	1
Palmers.	1
Charlotte	1
is	1
very	1
pretty,	1
I	1
can	1
tell	1
you.	1
You	1
may	1
see	1
her	1
if	1
you	1
look	1
this	1
way."	1
As	1
Elinor	1
was	1
certain	1
of	1
seeing	1
her	1
in	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
minutes,	1
without	1
taking	1
that	1
liberty,	1
she	1
begged	1
to	1
be	1
excused.	1
"Where	1
is	1
Marianne?	1
Has	1
she	1
run	1
away	1
because	1
we	1
are	1
come?	1
I	1
see	1
her	1
instrument	1
is	1
open."	1
"She	1
is	1
walking,	1
I	1
believe."	1
They	1
were	1
now	1
joined	1
by	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings,	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
patience	1
enough	1
to	1
wait	1
till	1
the	1
door	1
was	1
opened	1
before	1
she	1
told	1
HER	1
story.	1
She	1
came	1
hallooing	1
to	1
the	1
window,	1
"How	1
do	1
you	1
do,	1
my	1
dear?	1
How	1
does	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood	1
do?	1
And	1
where	1
are	1
your	1
sisters?	1
What!	1
all	1
alone!	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
glad	1
of	1
a	1
little	1
company	1
to	1
sit	1
with	1
you.	1
I	1
have	1
brought	1
my	1
other	1
son	1
and	1
daughter	1
to	1
see	1
you.	1
Only	1
think	1
of	1
their	1
coming	1
so	1
suddenly!	1
I	1
thought	1
I	1
heard	1
a	1
carriage	1
last	1
night,	1
while	1
we	1
were	1
drinking	1
our	1
tea,	1
but	1
it	1
never	1
entered	1
my	1
head	1
that	1
it	1
could	1
be	1
them.	1
I	1
thought	1
of	1
nothing	1
but	1
whether	1
it	1
might	1
not	1
be	1
Colonel	1
Brandon	1
come	1
back	1
again;	1
so	1
I	1
said	1
to	1
Sir	1
John,	1
I	1
do	1
think	1
I	1
hear	1
a	1
carriage;	1
perhaps	1
it	1
is	1
Colonel	1
Brandon	1
come	1
back	1
again"--	1
Elinor	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
turn	1
from	1
her,	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
her	1
story,	1
to	1
receive	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
party;	1
Lady	1
Middleton	1
introduced	1
the	1
two	1
strangers;	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood	1
and	1
Margaret	1
came	1
down	1
stairs	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
and	1
they	1
all	1
sat	1
down	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
one	1
another,	1
while	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
continued	1
her	1
story	1
as	1
she	1
walked	1
through	1
the	1
passage	1
into	1
the	1
parlour,	1
attended	1
by	1
Sir	1
John.	1
Mrs.	1
Palmer	1
was	1
several	1
years	1
younger	1
than	1
Lady	1
Middleton,	1
and	1
totally	1
unlike	1
her	1
in	1
every	1
respect.	1
She	1
was	1
short	1
and	1
plump,	1
had	1
a	1
very	1
pretty	1
face,	1
and	1
the	1
finest	1
expression	1
of	1
good	1
humour	1
in	1
it	1
that	1
could	1
possibly	1
be.	1
Her	1
manners	1
were	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
so	1
elegant	1
as	1
her	1
sister's,	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
much	1
more	1
prepossessing.	1
She	1
came	1
in	1
with	1
a	1
smile,	1
smiled	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
her	1
visit,	1
except	1
when	1
she	1
laughed,	1
and	1
smiled	1
when	1
she	1
went	1
away.	1
Her	1
husband	1
was	1
a	1
grave	1
looking	1
young	1
man	1
of	1
five	1
or	1
six	1
and	1
twenty,	1
with	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
more	1
fashion	1
and	1
sense	1
than	1
his	1
wife,	1
but	1
of	1
less	1
willingness	1
to	1
please	1
or	1
be	1
pleased.	1
He	1
entered	1
the	1
room	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
self-consequence,	1
slightly	1
bowed	1
to	1
the	1
ladies,	1
without	1
speaking	1
a	1
word,	1
and,	1
after	1
briefly	1
surveying	1
them	1
and	1
their	1
apartments,	1
took	1
up	1
a	1
newspaper	1
from	1
the	1
table,	1
and	1
continued	1
to	1
read	1
it	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
he	1
staid.	1
Mrs.	1
Palmer,	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
who	1
was	1
strongly	1
endowed	1
by	1
nature	1
with	1
a	1
turn	1
for	1
being	1
uniformly	1
civil	1
and	1
happy,	1
was	1
hardly	1
seated	1
before	1
her	1
admiration	1
of	1
the	1
parlour	1
and	1
every	1
thing	1
in	1
it	1
burst	1
forth.	1
"Well!	1
what	1
a	1
delightful	1
room	1
this	1
is!	1
I	1
never	1
saw	1
anything	1
so	1
charming!	1
Only	1
think,	1
Mamma,	1
how	1
it	1
is	1
improved	1
since	1
I	1
was	1
here	1
last!	1
I	1
always	1
thought	1
it	1
such	1
a	1
sweet	1
place,	1
ma'am!	1
(turning	1
to	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood)	1
but	1
you	1
have	1
made	1
it	1
so	1
charming!	1
Only	1
look,	1
sister,	1
how	1
delightful	1
every	1
thing	1
is!	1
How	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
such	1
a	1
house	1
for	1
myself!	1
Should	1
not	1
you,	1
Mr.	1
Palmer?"	1
Mr.	1
Palmer	1
made	1
her	1
no	1
answer,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
raise	1
his	1
eyes	1
from	1
the	1
newspaper.	1
"Mr.	1
Palmer	1
does	1
not	1
hear	1
me,"	1
said	1
she,	1
laughing;	1
"he	1
never	1
does	1
sometimes.	1
It	1
is	1
so	1
ridiculous!"	1
This	1
was	1
quite	1
a	1
new	1
idea	1
to	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood;	1
she	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
used	1
to	1
find	1
wit	1
in	1
the	1
inattention	1
of	1
any	1
one,	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
looking	1
with	1
surprise	1
at	1
them	1
both.	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings,	1
in	1
the	1
meantime,	1
talked	1
on	1
as	1
loud	1
as	1
she	1
could,	1
and	1
continued	1
her	1
account	1
of	1
their	1
surprise,	1
the	1
evening	1
before,	1
on	1
seeing	1
their	1
friends,	1
without	1
ceasing	1
till	1
every	1
thing	1
was	1
told.	1
Mrs.	1
Palmer	1
laughed	1
heartily	1
at	1
the	1
recollection	1
of	1
their	1
astonishment,	1
and	1
every	1
body	1
agreed,	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
times	1
over,	1
that	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
quite	1
an	1
agreeable	1
surprise.	1
"You	1
may	1
believe	1
how	1
glad	1
we	1
all	1
were	1
to	1
see	1
them,"	1
added	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings,	1
leaning	1
forward	1
towards	1
Elinor,	1
and	1
speaking	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
meant	1
to	1
be	1
heard	1
by	1
no	1
one	1
else,	1
though	1
they	1
were	1
seated	1
on	1
different	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
room;	1
"but,	1
however,	1
I	1
can't	1
help	1
wishing	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
travelled	1
quite	1
so	1
fast,	1
nor	1
made	1
such	1
a	1
long	1
journey	1
of	1
it,	1
for	1
they	1
came	1
all	1
round	1
by	1
London	1
upon	1
account	1
of	1
some	1
business,	1
for	1
you	1
know	1
(nodding	1
significantly	1
and	1
pointing	1
to	1
her	1
daughter)	1
it	1
was	1
wrong	1
in	1
her	1
situation.	1
I	1
wanted	1
her	1
to	1
stay	1
at	1
home	1
and	1
rest	1
this	1
morning,	1
but	1
she	1
would	1
come	1
with	1
us;	1
she	1
longed	1
so	1
much	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
all!"	1
Mrs.	1
Palmer	1
laughed,	1
and	1
said	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
do	1
her	1
any	1
harm.	1
"She	1
expects	1
to	1
be	1
confined	1
in	1
February,"	1
continued	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings.	1
Lady	1
Middleton	1
could	1
no	1
longer	1
endure	1
such	1
a	1
conversation,	1
and	1
therefore	1
exerted	1
herself	1
to	1
ask	1
Mr.	1
Palmer	1
if	1
there	1
was	1
any	1
news	1
in	1
the	1
paper.	1
"No,	1
none	1
at	1
all,"	1
he	1
replied,	1
and	1
read	1
on.	1
"Here	1
comes	1
Marianne,"	1
cried	1
Sir	1
John.	1
"Now,	1
Palmer,	1
you	1
shall	1
see	1
a	1
monstrous	1
pretty	1
girl."	1
He	1
immediately	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
passage,	1
opened	1
the	1
front	1
door,	1
and	1
ushered	1
her	1
in	1
himself.	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
asked	1
her,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
appeared,	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
to	1
Allenham;	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Palmer	1
laughed	1
so	1
heartily	1
at	1
the	1
question,	1
as	1
to	1
show	1
she	1
understood	1
it.	1
Mr.	1
Palmer	1
looked	1
up	1
on	1
her	1
entering	1
the	1
room,	1
stared	1
at	1
her	1
some	1
minutes,	1
and	1
then	1
returned	1
to	1
his	1
newspaper.	1
Mrs.	1
Palmer's	1
eye	1
was	1
now	1
caught	1
by	1
the	1
drawings	1
which	1
hung	1
round	1
the	1
room.	1
She	1
got	1
up	1
to	1
examine	1
them.	1
"Oh!	1
dear,	1
how	1
beautiful	1
these	1
are!	1
Well!	1
how	1
delightful!	1
Do	1
but	1
look,	1
mama,	1
how	1
sweet!	1
I	1
declare	1
they	1
are	1
quite	1
charming;	1
I	1
could	1
look	1
at	1
them	1
for	1
ever."	1
And	1
then	1
sitting	1
down	1
again,	1
she	1
very	1
soon	1
forgot	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
any	1
such	1
things	1
in	1
the	1
room.	1
When	1
Lady	1
Middleton	1
rose	1
to	1
go	1
away,	1
Mr.	1
Palmer	1
rose	1
also,	1
laid	1
down	1
the	1
newspaper,	1
stretched	1
himself	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
them	1
all	1
around.	1
"My	1
love,	1
have	1
you	1
been	1
asleep?"	1
said	1
his	1
wife,	1
laughing.	1
He	1
made	1
her	1
no	1
answer;	1
and	1
only	1
observed,	1
after	1
again	1
examining	1
the	1
room,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
very	1
low	1
pitched,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
ceiling	1
was	1
crooked.	1
He	1
then	1
made	1
his	1
bow,	1
and	1
departed	1
with	1
the	1
rest.	1
Sir	1
John	1
had	1
been	1
very	1
urgent	1
with	1
them	1
all	1
to	1
spend	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
at	1
the	1
park.	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood,	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
chuse	1
to	1
dine	1
with	1
them	1
oftener	1
than	1
they	1
dined	1
at	1
the	1
cottage,	1
absolutely	1
refused	1
on	1
her	1
own	1
account;	1
her	1
daughters	1
might	1
do	1
as	1
they	1
pleased.	1
But	1
they	1
had	1
no	1
curiosity	1
to	1
see	1
how	1
Mr.	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Palmer	1
ate	1
their	1
dinner,	1
and	1
no	1
expectation	1
of	1
pleasure	1
from	1
them	1
in	1
any	1
other	1
way.	1
They	1
attempted,	1
therefore,	1
likewise,	1
to	1
excuse	1
themselves;	1
the	1
weather	1
was	1
uncertain,	1
and	1
not	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
good.	1
But	1
Sir	1
John	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
satisfied--the	1
carriage	1
should	1
be	1
sent	1
for	1
them	1
and	1
they	1
must	1
come.	1
Lady	1
Middleton	1
too,	1
though	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
press	1
their	1
mother,	1
pressed	1
them.	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Palmer	1
joined	1
their	1
entreaties,	1
all	1
seemed	1
equally	1
anxious	1
to	1
avoid	1
a	1
family	1
party;	1
and	1
the	1
young	1
ladies	1
were	1
obliged	1
to	1
yield.	1
"Why	1
should	1
they	1
ask	1
us?"	1
said	1
Marianne,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
gone.	1
"The	1
rent	1
of	1
this	1
cottage	1
is	1
said	1
to	1
be	1
low;	1
but	1
we	1
have	1
it	1
on	1
very	1
hard	1
terms,	1
if	1
we	1
are	1
to	1
dine	1
at	1
the	1
park	1
whenever	1
any	1
one	1
is	1
staying	1
either	1
with	1
them,	1
or	1
with	1
us."	1
"They	1
mean	1
no	1
less	1
to	1
be	1
civil	1
and	1
kind	1
to	1
us	1
now,"	1
said	1
Elinor,	1
"by	1
these	1
frequent	1
invitations,	1
than	1
by	1
those	1
which	1
we	1
received	1
from	1
them	1
a	1
few	1
weeks	1
ago.	1
The	1
alteration	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
them,	1
if	1
their	1
parties	1
are	1
grown	1
tedious	1
and	1
dull.	1
We	1
must	1
look	1
for	1
the	1
change	1
elsewhere."	1
CHAPTER	1
20	1
As	1
the	1
Miss	1
Dashwoods	1
entered	1
the	1
drawing-room	1
of	1
the	1
park	1
the	1
next	1
day,	1
at	1
one	1
door,	1
Mrs.	1
Palmer	1
came	1
running	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
other,	1
looking	1
as	1
good	1
humoured	1
and	1
merry	1
as	1
before.	1
She	1
took	1
them	1
all	1
most	1
affectionately	1
by	1
the	1
hand,	1
and	1
expressed	1
great	1
delight	1
in	1
seeing	1
them	1
again.	1
"I	1
am	1
so	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
you!"	1
said	1
she,	1
seating	1
herself	1
between	1
Elinor	1
and	1
Marianne,	1
"for	1
it	1
is	1
so	1
bad	1
a	1
day	1
I	1
was	1
afraid	1
you	1
might	1
not	1
come,	1
which	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
shocking	1
thing,	1
as	1
we	1
go	1
away	1
again	1
tomorrow.	1
We	1
must	1
go,	1
for	1
the	1
Westons	1
come	1
to	1
us	1
next	1
week	1
you	1
know.	1
It	1
was	1
quite	1
a	1
sudden	1
thing	1
our	1
coming	1
at	1
all,	1
and	1
I	1
knew	1
nothing	1
of	1
it	1
till	1
the	1
carriage	1
was	1
coming	1
to	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
then	1
Mr.	1
Palmer	1
asked	1
me	1
if	1
I	1
would	1
go	1
with	1
him	1
to	1
Barton.	1
He	1
is	1
so	1
droll!	1
He	1
never	1
tells	1
me	1
any	1
thing!	1
I	1
am	1
so	1
sorry	1
we	1
cannot	1
stay	1
longer;	1
however	1
we	1
shall	1
meet	1
again	1
in	1
town	1
very	1
soon,	1
I	1
hope."	1
They	1
were	1
obliged	1
to	1
put	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
such	1
an	1
expectation.	1
"Not	1
go	1
to	1
town!"	1
cried	1
Mrs.	1
Palmer,	1
with	1
a	1
laugh,	1
"I	1
shall	1
be	1
quite	1
disappointed	1
if	1
you	1
do	1
not.	1
I	1
could	1
get	1
the	1
nicest	1
house	1
in	1
world	1
for	1
you,	1
next	1
door	1
to	1
ours,	1
in	1
Hanover-square.	1
You	1
must	1
come,	1
indeed.	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
very	1
happy	1
to	1
chaperon	1
you	1
at	1
any	1
time	1
till	1
I	1
am	1
confined,	1
if	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood	1
should	1
not	1
like	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
public."	1
They	1
thanked	1
her;	1
but	1
were	1
obliged	1
to	1
resist	1
all	1
her	1
entreaties.	1
"Oh,	1
my	1
love,"	1
cried	1
Mrs.	1
Palmer	1
to	1
her	1
husband,	1
who	1
just	1
then	1
entered	1
the	1
room--"you	1
must	1
help	1
me	1
to	1
persuade	1
the	1
Miss	1
Dashwoods	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
town	1
this	1
winter."	1
Her	1
love	1
made	1
no	1
answer;	1
and	1
after	1
slightly	1
bowing	1
to	1
the	1
ladies,	1
began	1
complaining	1
of	1
the	1
weather.	1
"How	1
horrid	1
all	1
this	1
is!"	1
said	1
he.	1
"Such	1
weather	1
makes	1
every	1
thing	1
and	1
every	1
body	1
disgusting.	1
Dullness	1
is	1
as	1
much	1
produced	1
within	1
doors	1
as	1
without,	1
by	1
rain.	1
It	1
makes	1
one	1
detest	1
all	1
one's	1
acquaintance.	1
What	1
the	1
devil	1
does	1
Sir	1
John	1
mean	1
by	1
not	1
having	1
a	1
billiard	1
room	1
in	1
his	1
house?	1
How	1
few	1
people	1
know	1
what	1
comfort	1
is!	1
Sir	1
John	1
is	1
as	1
stupid	1
as	1
the	1
weather."	1
The	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
company	1
soon	1
dropt	1
in.	1
"I	1
am	1
afraid,	1
Miss	1
Marianne,"	1
said	1
Sir	1
John,	1
"you	1
have	1
not	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
take	1
your	1
usual	1
walk	1
to	1
Allenham	1
today."	1
Marianne	1
looked	1
very	1
grave	1
and	1
said	1
nothing.	1
"Oh,	1
don't	1
be	1
so	1
sly	1
before	1
us,"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Palmer;	1
"for	1
we	1
know	1
all	1
about	1
it,	1
I	1
assure	1
you;	1
and	1
I	1
admire	1
your	1
taste	1
very	1
much,	1
for	1
I	1
think	1
he	1
is	1
extremely	1
handsome.	1
We	1
do	1
not	1
live	1
a	1
great	1
way	1
from	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
country,	1
you	1
know.	1
Not	1
above	1
ten	1
miles,	1
I	1
dare	1
say."	1
"Much	1
nearer	1
thirty,"	1
said	1
her	1
husband.	1
"Ah,	1
well!	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
much	1
difference.	1
I	1
never	1
was	1
at	1
his	1
house;	1
but	1
they	1
say	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
sweet	1
pretty	1
place."	1
"As	1
vile	1
a	1
spot	1
as	1
I	1
ever	1
saw	1
in	1
my	1
life,"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Palmer.	1
Marianne	1
remained	1
perfectly	1
silent,	1
though	1
her	1
countenance	1
betrayed	1
her	1
interest	1
in	1
what	1
was	1
said.	1
"Is	1
it	1
very	1
ugly?"	1
continued	1
Mrs.	1
Palmer--"then	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
some	1
other	1
place	1
that	1
is	1
so	1
pretty	1
I	1
suppose."	1
When	1
they	1
were	1
seated	1
in	1
the	1
dining	1
room,	1
Sir	1
John	1
observed	1
with	1
regret	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
only	1
eight	1
all	1
together.	1
"My	1
dear,"	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
his	1
lady,	1
"it	1
is	1
very	1
provoking	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
be	1
so	1
few.	1
Why	1
did	1
not	1
you	1
ask	1
the	1
Gilberts	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
us	1
today?"	1
"Did	1
not	1
I	1
tell	1
you,	1
Sir	1
John,	1
when	1
you	1
spoke	1
to	1
me	1
about	1
it	1
before,	1
that	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
done?	1
They	1
dined	1
with	1
us	1
last."	1
"You	1
and	1
I,	1
Sir	1
John,"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings,	1
"should	1
not	1
stand	1
upon	1
such	1
ceremony."	1
"Then	1
you	1
would	1
be	1
very	1
ill-bred,"	1
cried	1
Mr.	1
Palmer.	1
"My	1
love	1
you	1
contradict	1
every	1
body,"	1
said	1
his	1
wife	1
with	1
her	1
usual	1
laugh.	1
"Do	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
quite	1
rude?"	1
"I	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
I	1
contradicted	1
any	1
body	1
in	1
calling	1
your	1
mother	1
ill-bred."	1
"Ay,	1
you	1
may	1
abuse	1
me	1
as	1
you	1
please,"	1
said	1
the	1
good-natured	1
old	1
lady,	1
"you	1
have	1
taken	1
Charlotte	1
off	1
my	1
hands,	1
and	1
cannot	1
give	1
her	1
back	1
again.	1
So	1
there	1
I	1
have	1
the	1
whip	1
hand	1
of	1
you."	1
Charlotte	1
laughed	1
heartily	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
her	1
husband	1
could	1
not	1
get	1
rid	1
of	1
her;	1
and	1
exultingly	1
said,	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
care	1
how	1
cross	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
her,	1
as	1
they	1
must	1
live	1
together.	1
It	1
was	1
impossible	1
for	1
any	1
one	1
to	1
be	1
more	1
thoroughly	1
good-natured,	1
or	1
more	1
determined	1
to	1
be	1
happy	1
than	1
Mrs.	1
Palmer.	1
The	1
studied	1
indifference,	1
insolence,	1
and	1
discontent	1
of	1
her	1
husband	1
gave	1
her	1
no	1
pain;	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
scolded	1
or	1
abused	1
her,	1
she	1
was	1
highly	1
diverted.	1
"Mr.	1
Palmer	1
is	1
so	1
droll!"	1
said	1
she,	1
in	1
a	1
whisper,	1
to	1
Elinor.	1
"He	1
is	1
always	1
out	1
of	1
humour."	1
Elinor	1
was	1
not	1
inclined,	1
after	1
a	1
little	1
observation,	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
credit	1
for	1
being	1
so	1
genuinely	1
and	1
unaffectedly	1
ill-natured	1
or	1
ill-bred	1
as	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
appear.	1
His	1
temper	1
might	1
perhaps	1
be	1
a	1
little	1
soured	1
by	1
finding,	1
like	1
many	1
others	1
of	1
his	1
sex,	1
that	1
through	1
some	1
unaccountable	1
bias	1
in	1
favour	1
of	1
beauty,	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
husband	1
of	1
a	1
very	1
silly	1
woman,--but	1
she	1
knew	1
that	1
this	1
kind	1
of	1
blunder	1
was	1
too	1
common	1
for	1
any	1
sensible	1
man	1
to	1
be	1
lastingly	1
hurt	1
by	1
it.--	1
It	1
was	1
rather	1
a	1
wish	1
of	1
distinction,	1
she	1
believed,	1
which	1
produced	1
his	1
contemptuous	1
treatment	1
of	1
every	1
body,	1
and	1
his	1
general	1
abuse	1
of	1
every	1
thing	1
before	1
him.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
desire	1
of	1
appearing	1
superior	1
to	1
other	1
people.	1
The	1
motive	1
was	1
too	1
common	1
to	1
be	1
wondered	1
at;	1
but	1
the	1
means,	1
however	1
they	1
might	1
succeed	1
by	1
establishing	1
his	1
superiority	1
in	1
ill-breeding,	1
were	1
not	1
likely	1
to	1
attach	1
any	1
one	1
to	1
him	1
except	1
his	1
wife.	1
"Oh,	1
my	1
dear	1
Miss	1
Dashwood,"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Palmer	1
soon	1
afterwards,	1
"I	1
have	1
got	1
such	1
a	1
favour	1
to	1
ask	1
of	1
you	1
and	1
your	1
sister.	1
Will	1
you	1
come	1
and	1
spend	1
some	1
time	1
at	1
Cleveland	1
this	1
Christmas?	1
Now,	1
pray	1
do,--and	1
come	1
while	1
the	1
Westons	1
are	1
with	1
us.	1
You	1
cannot	1
think	1
how	1
happy	1
I	1
shall	1
be!	1
It	1
will	1
be	1
quite	1
delightful!--My	1
love,"	1
applying	1
to	1
her	1
husband,	1
"don't	1
you	1
long	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
Miss	1
Dashwoods	1
come	1
to	1
Cleveland?"	1
"Certainly,"	1
he	1
replied,	1
with	1
a	1
sneer--"I	1
came	1
into	1
Devonshire	1
with	1
no	1
other	1
view."	1
"There	1
now,"--said	1
his	1
lady,	1
"you	1
see	1
Mr.	1
Palmer	1
expects	1
you;	1
so	1
you	1
cannot	1
refuse	1
to	1
come."	1
They	1
both	1
eagerly	1
and	1
resolutely	1
declined	1
her	1
invitation.	1
"But	1
indeed	1
you	1
must	1
and	1
shall	1
come.	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
you	1
will	1
like	1
it	1
of	1
all	1
things.	1
The	1
Westons	1
will	1
be	1
with	1
us,	1
and	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
quite	1
delightful.	1
You	1
cannot	1
think	1
what	1
a	1
sweet	1
place	1
Cleveland	1
is;	1
and	1
we	1
are	1
so	1
gay	1
now,	1
for	1
Mr.	1
Palmer	1
is	1
always	1
going	1
about	1
the	1
country	1
canvassing	1
against	1
the	1
election;	1
and	1
so	1
many	1
people	1
came	1
to	1
dine	1
with	1
us	1
that	1
I	1
never	1
saw	1
before,	1
it	1
is	1
quite	1
charming!	1
But,	1
poor	1
fellow!	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
fatiguing	1
to	1
him!	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
forced	1
to	1
make	1
every	1
body	1
like	1
him."	1
Elinor	1
could	1
hardly	1
keep	1
her	1
countenance	1
as	1
she	1
assented	1
to	1
the	1
hardship	1
of	1
such	1
an	1
obligation.	1
"How	1
charming	1
it	1
will	1
be,"	1
said	1
Charlotte,	1
"when	1
he	1
is	1
in	1
Parliament!--won't	1
it?	1
How	1
I	1
shall	1
laugh!	1
It	1
will	1
be	1
so	1
ridiculous	1
to	1
see	1
all	1
his	1
letters	1
directed	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
an	1
M.P.--But	1
do	1
you	1
know,	1
he	1
says,	1
he	1
will	1
never	1
frank	1
for	1
me?	1
He	1
declares	1
he	1
won't.	1
Don't	1
you,	1
Mr.	1
Palmer?"	1
Mr.	1
Palmer	1
took	1
no	1
notice	1
of	1
her.	1
"He	1
cannot	1
bear	1
writing,	1
you	1
know,"	1
she	1
continued--	1
"he	1
says	1
it	1
is	1
quite	1
shocking."	1
"No,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"I	1
never	1
said	1
any	1
thing	1
so	1
irrational.	1
Don't	1
palm	1
all	1
your	1
abuses	1
of	1
languages	1
upon	1
me."	1
"There	1
now;	1
you	1
see	1
how	1
droll	1
he	1
is.	1
This	1
is	1
always	1
the	1
way	1
with	1
him!	1
Sometimes	1
he	1
won't	1
speak	1
to	1
me	1
for	1
half	1
a	1
day	1
together,	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
comes	1
out	1
with	1
something	1
so	1
droll--all	1
about	1
any	1
thing	1
in	1
the	1
world."	1
She	1
surprised	1
Elinor	1
very	1
much	1
as	1
they	1
returned	1
into	1
the	1
drawing-room,	1
by	1
asking	1
her	1
whether	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
Mr.	1
Palmer	1
excessively.	1
"Certainly,"	1
said	1
Elinor;	1
"he	1
seems	1
very	1
agreeable."	1
"Well--I	1
am	1
so	1
glad	1
you	1
do.	1
I	1
thought	1
you	1
would,	1
he	1
is	1
so	1
pleasant;	1
and	1
Mr.	1
Palmer	1
is	1
excessively	1
pleased	1
with	1
you	1
and	1
your	1
sisters	1
I	1
can	1
tell	1
you,	1
and	1
you	1
can't	1
think	1
how	1
disappointed	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
if	1
you	1
don't	1
come	1
to	1
Cleveland.--I	1
can't	1
imagine	1
why	1
you	1
should	1
object	1
to	1
it."	1
Elinor	1
was	1
again	1
obliged	1
to	1
decline	1
her	1
invitation;	1
and	1
by	1
changing	1
the	1
subject,	1
put	1
a	1
stop	1
to	1
her	1
entreaties.	1
She	1
thought	1
it	1
probable	1
that	1
as	1
they	1
lived	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
county,	1
Mrs.	1
Palmer	1
might	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
give	1
some	1
more	1
particular	1
account	1
of	1
Willoughby's	1
general	1
character,	1
than	1
could	1
be	1
gathered	1
from	1
the	1
Middletons'	1
partial	1
acquaintance	1
with	1
him;	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
eager	1
to	1
gain	1
from	1
any	1
one,	1
such	1
a	1
confirmation	1
of	1
his	1
merits	1
as	1
might	1
remove	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
fear	1
from	1
Marianne.	1
She	1
began	1
by	1
inquiring	1
if	1
they	1
saw	1
much	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Willoughby	1
at	1
Cleveland,	1
and	1
whether	1
they	1
were	1
intimately	1
acquainted	1
with	1
him.	1
"Oh	1
dear,	1
yes;	1
I	1
know	1
him	1
extremely	1
well,"	1
replied	1
Mrs.	1
Palmer;--"Not	1
that	1
I	1
ever	1
spoke	1
to	1
him,	1
indeed;	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
him	1
for	1
ever	1
in	1
town.	1
Somehow	1
or	1
other	1
I	1
never	1
happened	1
to	1
be	1
staying	1
at	1
Barton	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
Allenham.	1
Mama	1
saw	1
him	1
here	1
once	1
before;--	1
but	1
I	1
was	1
with	1
my	1
uncle	1
at	1
Weymouth.	1
However,	1
I	1
dare	1
say	1
we	1
should	1
have	1
seen	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
him	1
in	1
Somersetshire,	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
not	1
happened	1
very	1
unluckily	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
never	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
together.	1
He	1
is	1
very	1
little	1
at	1
Combe,	1
I	1
believe;	1
but	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
ever	1
so	1
much	1
there,	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
Mr.	1
Palmer	1
would	1
visit	1
him,	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
opposition,	1
you	1
know,	1
and	1
besides	1
it	1
is	1
such	1
a	1
way	1
off.	1
I	1
know	1
why	1
you	1
inquire	1
about	1
him,	1
very	1
well;	1
your	1
sister	1
is	1
to	1
marry	1
him.	1
I	1
am	1
monstrous	1
glad	1
of	1
it,	1
for	1
then	1
I	1
shall	1
have	1
her	1
for	1
a	1
neighbour	1
you	1
know."	1
"Upon	1
my	1
word,"	1
replied	1
Elinor,	1
"you	1
know	1
much	1
more	1
of	1
the	1
matter	1
than	1
I	1
do,	1
if	1
you	1
have	1
any	1
reason	1
to	1
expect	1
such	1
a	1
match."	1
"Don't	1
pretend	1
to	1
deny	1
it,	1
because	1
you	1
know	1
it	1
is	1
what	1
every	1
body	1
talks	1
of.	1
I	1
assure	1
you	1
I	1
heard	1
of	1
it	1
in	1
my	1
way	1
through	1
town."	1
"My	1
dear	1
Mrs.	1
Palmer!"	1
"Upon	1
my	1
honour	1
I	1
did.--I	1
met	1
Colonel	1
Brandon	1
Monday	1
morning	1
in	1
Bond-street,	1
just	1
before	1
we	1
left	1
town,	1
and	1
he	1
told	1
me	1
of	1
it	1
directly."	1
"You	1
surprise	1
me	1
very	1
much.	1
Colonel	1
Brandon	1
tell	1
you	1
of	1
it!	1
Surely	1
you	1
must	1
be	1
mistaken.	1
To	1
give	1
such	1
intelligence	1
to	1
a	1
person	1
who	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
interested	1
in	1
it,	1
even	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
true,	1
is	1
not	1
what	1
I	1
should	1
expect	1
Colonel	1
Brandon	1
to	1
do."	1
"But	1
I	1
do	1
assure	1
you	1
it	1
was	1
so,	1
for	1
all	1
that,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
you	1
how	1
it	1
happened.	1
When	1
we	1
met	1
him,	1
he	1
turned	1
back	1
and	1
walked	1
with	1
us;	1
and	1
so	1
we	1
began	1
talking	1
of	1
my	1
brother	1
and	1
sister,	1
and	1
one	1
thing	1
and	1
another,	1
and	1
I	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
'So,	1
Colonel,	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
new	1
family	1
come	1
to	1
Barton	1
cottage,	1
I	1
hear,	1
and	1
mama	1
sends	1
me	1
word	1
they	1
are	1
very	1
pretty,	1
and	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
is	1
going	1
to	1
be	1
married	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Willoughby	1
of	1
Combe	1
Magna.	1
Is	1
it	1
true,	1
pray?	1
for	1
of	1
course	1
you	1
must	1
know,	1
as	1
you	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
Devonshire	1
so	1
lately.'"	1
"And	1
what	1
did	1
the	1
Colonel	1
say?"	1
"Oh--he	1
did	1
not	1
say	1
much;	1
but	1
he	1
looked	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
knew	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
true,	1
so	1
from	1
that	1
moment	1
I	1
set	1
it	1
down	1
as	1
certain.	1
It	1
will	1
be	1
quite	1
delightful,	1
I	1
declare!	1
When	1
is	1
it	1
to	1
take	1
place?"	1
"Mr.	1
Brandon	1
was	1
very	1
well	1
I	1
hope?"	1
"Oh!	1
yes,	1
quite	1
well;	1
and	1
so	1
full	1
of	1
your	1
praises,	1
he	1
did	1
nothing	1
but	1
say	1
fine	1
things	1
of	1
you."	1
"I	1
am	1
flattered	1
by	1
his	1
commendation.	1
He	1
seems	1
an	1
excellent	1
man;	1
and	1
I	1
think	1
him	1
uncommonly	1
pleasing."	1
"So	1
do	1
I.--He	1
is	1
such	1
a	1
charming	1
man,	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
quite	1
a	1
pity	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
so	1
grave	1
and	1
so	1
dull.	1
Mamma	1
says	1
HE	1
was	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
your	1
sister	1
too.--	1
I	1
assure	1
you	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
compliment	1
if	1
he	1
was,	1
for	1
he	1
hardly	1
ever	1
falls	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
any	1
body."	1
"Is	1
Mr.	1
Willoughby	1
much	1
known	1
in	1
your	1
part	1
of	1
Somersetshire?"	1
said	1
Elinor.	1
"Oh!	1
yes,	1
extremely	1
well;	1
that	1
is,	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
believe	1
many	1
people	1
are	1
acquainted	1
with	1
him,	1
because	1
Combe	1
Magna	1
is	1
so	1
far	1
off;	1
but	1
they	1
all	1
think	1
him	1
extremely	1
agreeable	1
I	1
assure	1
you.	1
Nobody	1
is	1
more	1
liked	1
than	1
Mr.	1
Willoughby	1
wherever	1
he	1
goes,	1
and	1
so	1
you	1
may	1
tell	1
your	1
sister.	1
She	1
is	1
a	1
monstrous	1
lucky	1
girl	1
to	1
get	1
him,	1
upon	1
my	1
honour;	1
not	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
much	1
more	1
lucky	1
in	1
getting	1
her,	1
because	1
she	1
is	1
so	1
very	1
handsome	1
and	1
agreeable,	1
that	1
nothing	1
can	1
be	1
good	1
enough	1
for	1
her.	1
However,	1
I	1
don't	1
think	1
her	1
hardly	1
at	1
all	1
handsomer	1
than	1
you,	1
I	1
assure	1
you;	1
for	1
I	1
think	1
you	1
both	1
excessively	1
pretty,	1
and	1
so	1
does	1
Mr.	1
Palmer	1
too	1
I	1
am	1
sure,	1
though	1
we	1
could	1
not	1
get	1
him	1
to	1
own	1
it	1
last	1
night."	1
Mrs.	1
Palmer's	1
information	1
respecting	1
Willoughby	1
was	1
not	1
very	1
material;	1
but	1
any	1
testimony	1
in	1
his	1
favour,	1
however	1
small,	1
was	1
pleasing	1
to	1
her.	1
"I	1
am	1
so	1
glad	1
we	1
are	1
got	1
acquainted	1
at	1
last,"	1
continued	1
Charlotte.--"And	1
now	1
I	1
hope	1
we	1
shall	1
always	1
be	1
great	1
friends.	1
You	1
can't	1
think	1
how	1
much	1
I	1
longed	1
to	1
see	1
you!	1
It	1
is	1
so	1
delightful	1
that	1
you	1
should	1
live	1
at	1
the	1
cottage!	1
Nothing	1
can	1
be	1
like	1
it,	1
to	1
be	1
sure!	1
And	1
I	1
am	1
so	1
glad	1
your	1
sister	1
is	1
going	1
to	1
be	1
well	1
married!	1
I	1
hope	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
at	1
Combe	1
Magna.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
sweet	1
place,	1
by	1
all	1
accounts."	1
"You	1
have	1
been	1
long	1
acquainted	1
with	1
Colonel	1
Brandon,	1
have	1
not	1
you?"	1
"Yes,	1
a	1
great	1
while;	1
ever	1
since	1
my	1
sister	1
married.--	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
particular	1
friend	1
of	1
Sir	1
John's.	1
I	1
believe,"	1
she	1
added	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice,	1
"he	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
have	1
had	1
me,	1
if	1
he	1
could.	1
Sir	1
John	1
and	1
Lady	1
Middleton	1
wished	1
it	1
very	1
much.	1
But	1
mama	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
the	1
match	1
good	1
enough	1
for	1
me,	1
otherwise	1
Sir	1
John	1
would	1
have	1
mentioned	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
Colonel,	1
and	1
we	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
married	1
immediately."	1
"Did	1
not	1
Colonel	1
Brandon	1
know	1
of	1
Sir	1
John's	1
proposal	1
to	1
your	1
mother	1
before	1
it	1
was	1
made?	1
Had	1
he	1
never	1
owned	1
his	1
affection	1
to	1
yourself?"	1
"Oh,	1
no;	1
but	1
if	1
mama	1
had	1
not	1
objected	1
to	1
it,	1
I	1
dare	1
say	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
liked	1
it	1
of	1
all	1
things.	1
He	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
me	1
then	1
above	1
twice,	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
before	1
I	1
left	1
school.	1
However,	1
I	1
am	1
much	1
happier	1
as	1
I	1
am.	1
Mr.	1
Palmer	1
is	1
the	1
kind	1
of	1
man	1
I	1
like."	1
CHAPTER	1
21	1
The	1
Palmers	1
returned	1
to	1
Cleveland	1
the	1
next	1
day,	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
families	1
at	1
Barton	1
were	1
again	1
left	1
to	1
entertain	1
each	1
other.	1
But	1
this	1
did	1
not	1
last	1
long;	1
Elinor	1
had	1
hardly	1
got	1
their	1
last	1
visitors	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
head,	1
had	1
hardly	1
done	1
wondering	1
at	1
Charlotte's	1
being	1
so	1
happy	1
without	1
a	1
cause,	1
at	1
Mr.	1
Palmer's	1
acting	1
so	1
simply,	1
with	1
good	1
abilities,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
strange	1
unsuitableness	1
which	1
often	1
existed	1
between	1
husband	1
and	1
wife,	1
before	1
Sir	1
John's	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings's	1
active	1
zeal	1
in	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
society,	1
procured	1
her	1
some	1
other	1
new	1
acquaintance	1
to	1
see	1
and	1
observe.	1
In	1
a	1
morning's	1
excursion	1
to	1
Exeter,	1
they	1
had	1
met	1
with	1
two	1
young	1
ladies,	1
whom	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
had	1
the	1
satisfaction	1
of	1
discovering	1
to	1
be	1
her	1
relations,	1
and	1
this	1
was	1
enough	1
for	1
Sir	1
John	1
to	1
invite	1
them	1
directly	1
to	1
the	1
park,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
their	1
present	1
engagements	1
at	1
Exeter	1
were	1
over.	1
Their	1
engagements	1
at	1
Exeter	1
instantly	1
gave	1
way	1
before	1
such	1
an	1
invitation,	1
and	1
Lady	1
Middleton	1
was	1
thrown	1
into	1
no	1
little	1
alarm	1
on	1
the	1
return	1
of	1
Sir	1
John,	1
by	1
hearing	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
very	1
soon	1
to	1
receive	1
a	1
visit	1
from	1
two	1
girls	1
whom	1
she	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
in	1
her	1
life,	1
and	1
of	1
whose	1
elegance,--	1
whose	1
tolerable	1
gentility	1
even,	1
she	1
could	1
have	1
no	1
proof;	1
for	1
the	1
assurances	1
of	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
mother	1
on	1
that	1
subject	1
went	1
for	1
nothing	1
at	1
all.	1
Their	1
being	1
her	1
relations	1
too	1
made	1
it	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
worse;	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings's	1
attempts	1
at	1
consolation	1
were	1
therefore	1
unfortunately	1
founded,	1
when	1
she	1
advised	1
her	1
daughter	1
not	1
to	1
care	1
about	1
their	1
being	1
so	1
fashionable;	1
because	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
cousins	1
and	1
must	1
put	1
up	1
with	1
one	1
another.	1
As	1
it	1
was	1
impossible,	1
however,	1
now	1
to	1
prevent	1
their	1
coming,	1
Lady	1
Middleton	1
resigned	1
herself	1
to	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
it,	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
philosophy	1
of	1
a	1
well-bred	1
woman,	1
contenting	1
herself	1
with	1
merely	1
giving	1
her	1
husband	1
a	1
gentle	1
reprimand	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
five	1
or	1
six	1
times	1
every	1
day.	1
The	1
young	1
ladies	1
arrived:	1
their	1
appearance	1
was	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
ungenteel	1
or	1
unfashionable.	1
Their	1
dress	1
was	1
very	1
smart,	1
their	1
manners	1
very	1
civil,	1
they	1
were	1
delighted	1
with	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
in	1
raptures	1
with	1
the	1
furniture,	1
and	1
they	1
happened	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
doatingly	1
fond	1
of	1
children	1
that	1
Lady	1
Middleton's	1
good	1
opinion	1
was	1
engaged	1
in	1
their	1
favour	1
before	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
an	1
hour	1
at	1
the	1
Park.	1
She	1
declared	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
very	1
agreeable	1
girls	1
indeed,	1
which	1
for	1
her	1
ladyship	1
was	1
enthusiastic	1
admiration.	1
Sir	1
John's	1
confidence	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
judgment	1
rose	1
with	1
this	1
animated	1
praise,	1
and	1
he	1
set	1
off	1
directly	1
for	1
the	1
cottage	1
to	1
tell	1
the	1
Miss	1
Dashwoods	1
of	1
the	1
Miss	1
Steeles'	1
arrival,	1
and	1
to	1
assure	1
them	1
of	1
their	1
being	1
the	1
sweetest	1
girls	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
From	1
such	1
commendation	1
as	1
this,	1
however,	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
much	1
to	1
be	1
learned;	1
Elinor	1
well	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
sweetest	1
girls	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
met	1
with	1
in	1
every	1
part	1
of	1
England,	1
under	1
every	1
possible	1
variation	1
of	1
form,	1
face,	1
temper	1
and	1
understanding.	1
Sir	1
John	1
wanted	1
the	1
whole	1
family	1
to	1
walk	1
to	1
the	1
Park	1
directly	1
and	1
look	1
at	1
his	1
guests.	1
Benevolent,	1
philanthropic	1
man!	1
It	1
was	1
painful	1
to	1
him	1
even	1
to	1
keep	1
a	1
third	1
cousin	1
to	1
himself.	1
"Do	1
come	1
now,"	1
said	1
he--"pray	1
come--you	1
must	1
come--I	1
declare	1
you	1
shall	1
come--You	1
can't	1
think	1
how	1
you	1
will	1
like	1
them.	1
Lucy	1
is	1
monstrous	1
pretty,	1
and	1
so	1
good	1
humoured	1
and	1
agreeable!	1
The	1
children	1
are	1
all	1
hanging	1
about	1
her	1
already,	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
was	1
an	1
old	1
acquaintance.	1
And	1
they	1
both	1
long	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
of	1
all	1
things,	1
for	1
they	1
have	1
heard	1
at	1
Exeter	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
the	1
most	1
beautiful	1
creatures	1
in	1
the	1
world;	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
told	1
them	1
it	1
is	1
all	1
very	1
true,	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
more.	1
You	1
will	1
be	1
delighted	1
with	1
them	1
I	1
am	1
sure.	1
They	1
have	1
brought	1
the	1
whole	1
coach	1
full	1
of	1
playthings	1
for	1
the	1
children.	1
How	1
can	1
you	1
be	1
so	1
cross	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
come?	1
Why	1
they	1
are	1
your	1
cousins,	1
you	1
know,	1
after	1
a	1
fashion.	1
YOU	1
are	1
my	1
cousins,	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
my	1
wife's,	1
so	1
you	1
must	1
be	1
related."	1
But	1
Sir	1
John	1
could	1
not	1
prevail.	1
He	1
could	1
only	1
obtain	1
a	1
promise	1
of	1
their	1
calling	1
at	1
the	1
Park	1
within	1
a	1
day	1
or	1
two,	1
and	1
then	1
left	1
them	1
in	1
amazement	1
at	1
their	1
indifference,	1
to	1
walk	1
home	1
and	1
boast	1
anew	1
of	1
their	1
attractions	1
to	1
the	1
Miss	1
Steeles,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
already	1
boasting	1
of	1
the	1
Miss	1
Steeles	1
to	1
them.	1
When	1
their	1
promised	1
visit	1
to	1
the	1
Park	1
and	1
consequent	1
introduction	1
to	1
these	1
young	1
ladies	1
took	1
place,	1
they	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
the	1
eldest,	1
who	1
was	1
nearly	1
thirty,	1
with	1
a	1
very	1
plain	1
and	1
not	1
a	1
sensible	1
face,	1
nothing	1
to	1
admire;	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
other,	1
who	1
was	1
not	1
more	1
than	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
and	1
twenty,	1
they	1
acknowledged	1
considerable	1
beauty;	1
her	1
features	1
were	1
pretty,	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
a	1
sharp	1
quick	1
eye,	1
and	1
a	1
smartness	1
of	1
air,	1
which	1
though	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
give	1
actual	1
elegance	1
or	1
grace,	1
gave	1
distinction	1
to	1
her	1
person.--	1
Their	1
manners	1
were	1
particularly	1
civil,	1
and	1
Elinor	1
soon	1
allowed	1
them	1
credit	1
for	1
some	1
kind	1
of	1
sense,	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
with	1
what	1
constant	1
and	1
judicious	1
attention	1
they	1
were	1
making	1
themselves	1
agreeable	1
to	1
Lady	1
Middleton.	1
With	1
her	1
children	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
continual	1
raptures,	1
extolling	1
their	1
beauty,	1
courting	1
their	1
notice,	1
and	1
humouring	1
their	1
whims;	1
and	1
such	1
of	1
their	1
time	1
as	1
could	1
be	1
spared	1
from	1
the	1
importunate	1
demands	1
which	1
this	1
politeness	1
made	1
on	1
it,	1
was	1
spent	1
in	1
admiration	1
of	1
whatever	1
her	1
ladyship	1
was	1
doing,	1
if	1
she	1
happened	1
to	1
be	1
doing	1
any	1
thing,	1
or	1
in	1
taking	1
patterns	1
of	1
some	1
elegant	1
new	1
dress,	1
in	1
which	1
her	1
appearance	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
had	1
thrown	1
them	1
into	1
unceasing	1
delight.	1
Fortunately	1
for	1
those	1
who	1
pay	1
their	1
court	1
through	1
such	1
foibles,	1
a	1
fond	1
mother,	1
though,	1
in	1
pursuit	1
of	1
praise	1
for	1
her	1
children,	1
the	1
most	1
rapacious	1
of	1
human	1
beings,	1
is	1
likewise	1
the	1
most	1
credulous;	1
her	1
demands	1
are	1
exorbitant;	1
but	1
she	1
will	1
swallow	1
any	1
thing;	1
and	1
the	1
excessive	1
affection	1
and	1
endurance	1
of	1
the	1
Miss	1
Steeles	1
towards	1
her	1
offspring	1
were	1
viewed	1
therefore	1
by	1
Lady	1
Middleton	1
without	1
the	1
smallest	1
surprise	1
or	1
distrust.	1
She	1
saw	1
with	1
maternal	1
complacency	1
all	1
the	1
impertinent	1
encroachments	1
and	1
mischievous	1
tricks	1
to	1
which	1
her	1
cousins	1
submitted.	1
She	1
saw	1
their	1
sashes	1
untied,	1
their	1
hair	1
pulled	1
about	1
their	1
ears,	1
their	1
work-bags	1
searched,	1
and	1
their	1
knives	1
and	1
scissors	1
stolen	1
away,	1
and	1
felt	1
no	1
doubt	1
of	1
its	1
being	1
a	1
reciprocal	1
enjoyment.	1
It	1
suggested	1
no	1
other	1
surprise	1
than	1
that	1
Elinor	1
and	1
Marianne	1
should	1
sit	1
so	1
composedly	1
by,	1
without	1
claiming	1
a	1
share	1
in	1
what	1
was	1
passing.	1
"John	1
is	1
in	1
such	1
spirits	1
today!"	1
said	1
she,	1
on	1
his	1
taking	1
Miss	1
Steeles's	1
pocket	1
handkerchief,	1
and	1
throwing	1
it	1
out	1
of	1
window--"He	1
is	1
full	1
of	1
monkey	1
tricks."	1
And	1
soon	1
afterwards,	1
on	1
the	1
second	1
boy's	1
violently	1
pinching	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
lady's	1
fingers,	1
she	1
fondly	1
observed,	1
"How	1
playful	1
William	1
is!"	1
"And	1
here	1
is	1
my	1
sweet	1
little	1
Annamaria,"	1
she	1
added,	1
tenderly	1
caressing	1
a	1
little	1
girl	1
of	1
three	1
years	1
old,	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
made	1
a	1
noise	1
for	1
the	1
last	1
two	1
minutes;	1
"And	1
she	1
is	1
always	1
so	1
gentle	1
and	1
quiet--Never	1
was	1
there	1
such	1
a	1
quiet	1
little	1
thing!"	1
But	1
unfortunately	1
in	1
bestowing	1
these	1
embraces,	1
a	1
pin	1
in	1
her	1
ladyship's	1
head	1
dress	1
slightly	1
scratching	1
the	1
child's	1
neck,	1
produced	1
from	1
this	1
pattern	1
of	1
gentleness	1
such	1
violent	1
screams,	1
as	1
could	1
hardly	1
be	1
outdone	1
by	1
any	1
creature	1
professedly	1
noisy.	1
The	1
mother's	1
consternation	1
was	1
excessive;	1
but	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
surpass	1
the	1
alarm	1
of	1
the	1
Miss	1
Steeles,	1
and	1
every	1
thing	1
was	1
done	1
by	1
all	1
three,	1
in	1
so	1
critical	1
an	1
emergency,	1
which	1
affection	1
could	1
suggest	1
as	1
likely	1
to	1
assuage	1
the	1
agonies	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
sufferer.	1
She	1
was	1
seated	1
in	1
her	1
mother's	1
lap,	1
covered	1
with	1
kisses,	1
her	1
wound	1
bathed	1
with	1
lavender-water,	1
by	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
Miss	1
Steeles,	1
who	1
was	1
on	1
her	1
knees	1
to	1
attend	1
her,	1
and	1
her	1
mouth	1
stuffed	1
with	1
sugar	1
plums	1
by	1
the	1
other.	1
With	1
such	1
a	1
reward	1
for	1
her	1
tears,	1
the	1
child	1
was	1
too	1
wise	1
to	1
cease	1
crying.	1
She	1
still	1
screamed	1
and	1
sobbed	1
lustily,	1
kicked	1
her	1
two	1
brothers	1
for	1
offering	1
to	1
touch	1
her,	1
and	1
all	1
their	1
united	1
soothings	1
were	1
ineffectual	1
till	1
Lady	1
Middleton	1
luckily	1
remembering	1
that	1
in	1
a	1
scene	1
of	1
similar	1
distress	1
last	1
week,	1
some	1
apricot	1
marmalade	1
had	1
been	1
successfully	1
applied	1
for	1
a	1
bruised	1
temple,	1
the	1
same	1
remedy	1
was	1
eagerly	1
proposed	1
for	1
this	1
unfortunate	1
scratch,	1
and	1
a	1
slight	1
intermission	1
of	1
screams	1
in	1
the	1
young	1
lady	1
on	1
hearing	1
it,	1
gave	1
them	1
reason	1
to	1
hope	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
rejected.--	1
She	1
was	1
carried	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
therefore	1
in	1
her	1
mother's	1
arms,	1
in	1
quest	1
of	1
this	1
medicine,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
two	1
boys	1
chose	1
to	1
follow,	1
though	1
earnestly	1
entreated	1
by	1
their	1
mother	1
to	1
stay	1
behind,	1
the	1
four	1
young	1
ladies	1
were	1
left	1
in	1
a	1
quietness	1
which	1
the	1
room	1
had	1
not	1
known	1
for	1
many	1
hours.	1
"Poor	1
little	1
creatures!"	1
said	1
Miss	1
Steele,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
gone.	1
"It	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
very	1
sad	1
accident."	1
"Yet	1
I	1
hardly	1
know	1
how,"	1
cried	1
Marianne,	1
"unless	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
under	1
totally	1
different	1
circumstances.	1
But	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
usual	1
way	1
of	1
heightening	1
alarm,	1
where	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
to	1
be	1
alarmed	1
at	1
in	1
reality."	1
"What	1
a	1
sweet	1
woman	1
Lady	1
Middleton	1
is!"	1
said	1
Lucy	1
Steele.	1
Marianne	1
was	1
silent;	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
for	1
her	1
to	1
say	1
what	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
feel,	1
however	1
trivial	1
the	1
occasion;	1
and	1
upon	1
Elinor	1
therefore	1
the	1
whole	1
task	1
of	1
telling	1
lies	1
when	1
politeness	1
required	1
it,	1
always	1
fell.	1
She	1
did	1
her	1
best	1
when	1
thus	1
called	1
on,	1
by	1
speaking	1
of	1
Lady	1
Middleton	1
with	1
more	1
warmth	1
than	1
she	1
felt,	1
though	1
with	1
far	1
less	1
than	1
Miss	1
Lucy.	1
"And	1
Sir	1
John	1
too,"	1
cried	1
the	1
elder	1
sister,	1
"what	1
a	1
charming	1
man	1
he	1
is!"	1
Here	1
too,	1
Miss	1
Dashwood's	1
commendation,	1
being	1
only	1
simple	1
and	1
just,	1
came	1
in	1
without	1
any	1
eclat.	1
She	1
merely	1
observed	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
perfectly	1
good	1
humoured	1
and	1
friendly.	1
"And	1
what	1
a	1
charming	1
little	1
family	1
they	1
have!	1
I	1
never	1
saw	1
such	1
fine	1
children	1
in	1
my	1
life.--I	1
declare	1
I	1
quite	1
doat	1
upon	1
them	1
already,	1
and	1
indeed	1
I	1
am	1
always	1
distractedly	1
fond	1
of	1
children."	1
"I	1
should	1
guess	1
so,"	1
said	1
Elinor,	1
with	1
a	1
smile,	1
"from	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
witnessed	1
this	1
morning."	1
"I	1
have	1
a	1
notion,"	1
said	1
Lucy,	1
"you	1
think	1
the	1
little	1
Middletons	1
rather	1
too	1
much	1
indulged;	1
perhaps	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
the	1
outside	1
of	1
enough;	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
so	1
natural	1
in	1
Lady	1
Middleton;	1
and	1
for	1
my	1
part,	1
I	1
love	1
to	1
see	1
children	1
full	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
spirits;	1
I	1
cannot	1
bear	1
them	1
if	1
they	1
are	1
tame	1
and	1
quiet."	1
"I	1
confess,"	1
replied	1
Elinor,	1
"that	1
while	1
I	1
am	1
at	1
Barton	1
Park,	1
I	1
never	1
think	1
of	1
tame	1
and	1
quiet	1
children	1
with	1
any	1
abhorrence."	1
A	1
short	1
pause	1
succeeded	1
this	1
speech,	1
which	1
was	1
first	1
broken	1
by	1
Miss	1
Steele,	1
who	1
seemed	1
very	1
much	1
disposed	1
for	1
conversation,	1
and	1
who	1
now	1
said	1
rather	1
abruptly,	1
"And	1
how	1
do	1
you	1
like	1
Devonshire,	1
Miss	1
Dashwood?	1
I	1
suppose	1
you	1
were	1
very	1
sorry	1
to	1
leave	1
Sussex."	1
In	1
some	1
surprise	1
at	1
the	1
familiarity	1
of	1
this	1
question,	1
or	1
at	1
least	1
of	1
the	1
manner	1
in	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
spoken,	1
Elinor	1
replied	1
that	1
she	1
was.	1
"Norland	1
is	1
a	1
prodigious	1
beautiful	1
place,	1
is	1
not	1
it?"	1
added	1
Miss	1
Steele.	1
"We	1
have	1
heard	1
Sir	1
John	1
admire	1
it	1
excessively,"	1
said	1
Lucy,	1
who	1
seemed	1
to	1
think	1
some	1
apology	1
necessary	1
for	1
the	1
freedom	1
of	1
her	1
sister.	1
"I	1
think	1
every	1
one	1
MUST	1
admire	1
it,"	1
replied	1
Elinor,	1
"who	1
ever	1
saw	1
the	1
place;	1
though	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
supposed	1
that	1
any	1
one	1
can	1
estimate	1
its	1
beauties	1
as	1
we	1
do."	1
"And	1
had	1
you	1
a	1
great	1
many	1
smart	1
beaux	1
there?	1
I	1
suppose	1
you	1
have	1
not	1
so	1
many	1
in	1
this	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
world;	1
for	1
my	1
part,	1
I	1
think	1
they	1
are	1
a	1
vast	1
addition	1
always."	1
"But	1
why	1
should	1
you	1
think,"	1
said	1
Lucy,	1
looking	1
ashamed	1
of	1
her	1
sister,	1
"that	1
there	1
are	1
not	1
as	1
many	1
genteel	1
young	1
men	1
in	1
Devonshire	1
as	1
Sussex?"	1
"Nay,	1
my	1
dear,	1
I'm	1
sure	1
I	1
don't	1
pretend	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
there	1
an't.	1
I'm	1
sure	1
there's	1
a	1
vast	1
many	1
smart	1
beaux	1
in	1
Exeter;	1
but	1
you	1
know,	1
how	1
could	1
I	1
tell	1
what	1
smart	1
beaux	1
there	1
might	1
be	1
about	1
Norland;	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
only	1
afraid	1
the	1
Miss	1
Dashwoods	1
might	1
find	1
it	1
dull	1
at	1
Barton,	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
so	1
many	1
as	1
they	1
used	1
to	1
have.	1
But	1
perhaps	1
you	1
young	1
ladies	1
may	1
not	1
care	1
about	1
the	1
beaux,	1
and	1
had	1
as	1
lief	1
be	1
without	1
them	1
as	1
with	1
them.	1
For	1
my	1
part,	1
I	1
think	1
they	1
are	1
vastly	1
agreeable,	1
provided	1
they	1
dress	1
smart	1
and	1
behave	1
civil.	1
But	1
I	1
can't	1
bear	1
to	1
see	1
them	1
dirty	1
and	1
nasty.	1
Now	1
there's	1
Mr.	1
Rose	1
at	1
Exeter,	1
a	1
prodigious	1
smart	1
young	1
man,	1
quite	1
a	1
beau,	1
clerk	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Simpson,	1
you	1
know,	1
and	1
yet	1
if	1
you	1
do	1
but	1
meet	1
him	1
of	1
a	1
morning,	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
fit	1
to	1
be	1
seen.--	1
I	1
suppose	1
your	1
brother	1
was	1
quite	1
a	1
beau,	1
Miss	1
Dashwood,	1
before	1
he	1
married,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
rich?"	1
"Upon	1
my	1
word,"	1
replied	1
Elinor,	1
"I	1
cannot	1
tell	1
you,	1
for	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
perfectly	1
comprehend	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
the	1
word.	1
But	1
this	1
I	1
can	1
say,	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
ever	1
was	1
a	1
beau	1
before	1
he	1
married,	1
he	1
is	1
one	1
still	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
smallest	1
alteration	1
in	1
him."	1
"Oh!	1
dear!	1
one	1
never	1
thinks	1
of	1
married	1
men's	1
being	1
beaux--they	1
have	1
something	1
else	1
to	1
do."	1
"Lord!	1
Anne,"	1
cried	1
her	1
sister,	1
"you	1
can	1
talk	1
of	1
nothing	1
but	1
beaux;--you	1
will	1
make	1
Miss	1
Dashwood	1
believe	1
you	1
think	1
of	1
nothing	1
else."	1
And	1
then	1
to	1
turn	1
the	1
discourse,	1
she	1
began	1
admiring	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
the	1
furniture.	1
This	1
specimen	1
of	1
the	1
Miss	1
Steeles	1
was	1
enough.	1
The	1
vulgar	1
freedom	1
and	1
folly	1
of	1
the	1
eldest	1
left	1
her	1
no	1
recommendation,	1
and	1
as	1
Elinor	1
was	1
not	1
blinded	1
by	1
the	1
beauty,	1
or	1
the	1
shrewd	1
look	1
of	1
the	1
youngest,	1
to	1
her	1
want	1
of	1
real	1
elegance	1
and	1
artlessness,	1
she	1
left	1
the	1
house	1
without	1
any	1
wish	1
of	1
knowing	1
them	1
better.	1
Not	1
so	1
the	1
Miss	1
Steeles.--They	1
came	1
from	1
Exeter,	1
well	1
provided	1
with	1
admiration	1
for	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
Sir	1
John	1
Middleton,	1
his	1
family,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
relations,	1
and	1
no	1
niggardly	1
proportion	1
was	1
now	1
dealt	1
out	1
to	1
his	1
fair	1
cousins,	1
whom	1
they	1
declared	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
most	1
beautiful,	1
elegant,	1
accomplished,	1
and	1
agreeable	1
girls	1
they	1
had	1
ever	1
beheld,	1
and	1
with	1
whom	1
they	1
were	1
particularly	1
anxious	1
to	1
be	1
better	1
acquainted.--	1
And	1
to	1
be	1
better	1
acquainted	1
therefore,	1
Elinor	1
soon	1
found	1
was	1
their	1
inevitable	1
lot,	1
for	1
as	1
Sir	1
John	1
was	1
entirely	1
on	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
Miss	1
Steeles,	1
their	1
party	1
would	1
be	1
too	1
strong	1
for	1
opposition,	1
and	1
that	1
kind	1
of	1
intimacy	1
must	1
be	1
submitted	1
to,	1
which	1
consists	1
of	1
sitting	1
an	1
hour	1
or	1
two	1
together	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
room	1
almost	1
every	1
day.	1
Sir	1
John	1
could	1
do	1
no	1
more;	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
that	1
any	1
more	1
was	1
required:	1
to	1
be	1
together	1
was,	1
in	1
his	1
opinion,	1
to	1
be	1
intimate,	1
and	1
while	1
his	1
continual	1
schemes	1
for	1
their	1
meeting	1
were	1
effectual,	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
a	1
doubt	1
of	1
their	1
being	1
established	1
friends.	1
To	1
do	1
him	1
justice,	1
he	1
did	1
every	1
thing	1
in	1
his	1
power	1
to	1
promote	1
their	1
unreserve,	1
by	1
making	1
the	1
Miss	1
Steeles	1
acquainted	1
with	1
whatever	1
he	1
knew	1
or	1
supposed	1
of	1
his	1
cousins'	1
situations	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
delicate	1
particulars,--and	1
Elinor	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
them	1
more	1
than	1
twice,	1
before	1
the	1
eldest	1
of	1
them	1
wished	1
her	1
joy	1
on	1
her	1
sister's	1
having	1
been	1
so	1
lucky	1
as	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
conquest	1
of	1
a	1
very	1
smart	1
beau	1
since	1
she	1
came	1
to	1
Barton.	1
"'Twill	1
be	1
a	1
fine	1
thing	1
to	1
have	1
her	1
married	1
so	1
young	1
to	1
be	1
sure,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"and	1
I	1
hear	1
he	1
is	1
quite	1
a	1
beau,	1
and	1
prodigious	1
handsome.	1
And	1
I	1
hope	1
you	1
may	1
have	1
as	1
good	1
luck	1
yourself	1
soon,--but	1
perhaps	1
you	1
may	1
have	1
a	1
friend	1
in	1
the	1
corner	1
already."	1
Elinor	1
could	1
not	1
suppose	1
that	1
Sir	1
John	1
would	1
be	1
more	1
nice	1
in	1
proclaiming	1
his	1
suspicions	1
of	1
her	1
regard	1
for	1
Edward,	1
than	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
with	1
respect	1
to	1
Marianne;	1
indeed	1
it	1
was	1
rather	1
his	1
favourite	1
joke	1
of	1
the	1
two,	1
as	1
being	1
somewhat	1
newer	1
and	1
more	1
conjectural;	1
and	1
since	1
Edward's	1
visit,	1
they	1
had	1
never	1
dined	1
together	1
without	1
his	1
drinking	1
to	1
her	1
best	1
affections	1
with	1
so	1
much	1
significancy	1
and	1
so	1
many	1
nods	1
and	1
winks,	1
as	1
to	1
excite	1
general	1
attention.	1
The	1
letter	1
F--	1
had	1
been	1
likewise	1
invariably	1
brought	1
forward,	1
and	1
found	1
productive	1
of	1
such	1
countless	1
jokes,	1
that	1
its	1
character	1
as	1
the	1
wittiest	1
letter	1
in	1
the	1
alphabet	1
had	1
been	1
long	1
established	1
with	1
Elinor.	1
The	1
Miss	1
Steeles,	1
as	1
she	1
expected,	1
had	1
now	1
all	1
the	1
benefit	1
of	1
these	1
jokes,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
eldest	1
of	1
them	1
they	1
raised	1
a	1
curiosity	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
gentleman	1
alluded	1
to,	1
which,	1
though	1
often	1
impertinently	1
expressed,	1
was	1
perfectly	1
of	1
a	1
piece	1
with	1
her	1
general	1
inquisitiveness	1
into	1
the	1
concerns	1
of	1
their	1
family.	1
But	1
Sir	1
John	1
did	1
not	1
sport	1
long	1
with	1
the	1
curiosity	1
which	1
he	1
delighted	1
to	1
raise,	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
at	1
least	1
as	1
much	1
pleasure	1
in	1
telling	1
the	1
name,	1
as	1
Miss	1
Steele	1
had	1
in	1
hearing	1
it.	1
"His	1
name	1
is	1
Ferrars,"	1
said	1
he,	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
audible	1
whisper;	1
"but	1
pray	1
do	1
not	1
tell	1
it,	1
for	1
it's	1
a	1
great	1
secret."	1
"Ferrars!"	1
repeated	1
Miss	1
Steele;	1
"Mr.	1
Ferrars	1
is	1
the	1
happy	1
man,	1
is	1
he?	1
What!	1
your	1
sister-in-law's	1
brother,	1
Miss	1
Dashwood?	1
a	1
very	1
agreeable	1
young	1
man	1
to	1
be	1
sure;	1
I	1
know	1
him	1
very	1
well."	1
"How	1
can	1
you	1
say	1
so,	1
Anne?"	1
cried	1
Lucy,	1
who	1
generally	1
made	1
an	1
amendment	1
to	1
all	1
her	1
sister's	1
assertions.	1
"Though	1
we	1
have	1
seen	1
him	1
once	1
or	1
twice	1
at	1
my	1
uncle's,	1
it	1
is	1
rather	1
too	1
much	1
to	1
pretend	1
to	1
know	1
him	1
very	1
well."	1
Elinor	1
heard	1
all	1
this	1
with	1
attention	1
and	1
surprise.	1
"And	1
who	1
was	1
this	1
uncle?	1
Where	1
did	1
he	1
live?	1
How	1
came	1
they	1
acquainted?"	1
She	1
wished	1
very	1
much	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
subject	1
continued,	1
though	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
chuse	1
to	1
join	1
in	1
it	1
herself;	1
but	1
nothing	1
more	1
of	1
it	1
was	1
said,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
in	1
her	1
life,	1
she	1
thought	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
deficient	1
either	1
in	1
curiosity	1
after	1
petty	1
information,	1
or	1
in	1
a	1
disposition	1
to	1
communicate	1
it.	1
The	1
manner	1
in	1
which	1
Miss	1
Steele	1
had	1
spoken	1
of	1
Edward,	1
increased	1
her	1
curiosity;	1
for	1
it	1
struck	1
her	1
as	1
being	1
rather	1
ill-natured,	1
and	1
suggested	1
the	1
suspicion	1
of	1
that	1
lady's	1
knowing,	1
or	1
fancying	1
herself	1
to	1
know	1
something	1
to	1
his	1
disadvantage.--But	1
her	1
curiosity	1
was	1
unavailing,	1
for	1
no	1
farther	1
notice	1
was	1
taken	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Ferrars's	1
name	1
by	1
Miss	1
Steele	1
when	1
alluded	1
to,	1
or	1
even	1
openly	1
mentioned	1
by	1
Sir	1
John.	1
CHAPTER	1
22	1
Marianne,	1
who	1
had	1
never	1
much	1
toleration	1
for	1
any	1
thing	1
like	1
impertinence,	1
vulgarity,	1
inferiority	1
of	1
parts,	1
or	1
even	1
difference	1
of	1
taste	1
from	1
herself,	1
was	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
particularly	1
ill-disposed,	1
from	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
her	1
spirits,	1
to	1
be	1
pleased	1
with	1
the	1
Miss	1
Steeles,	1
or	1
to	1
encourage	1
their	1
advances;	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
invariable	1
coldness	1
of	1
her	1
behaviour	1
towards	1
them,	1
which	1
checked	1
every	1
endeavour	1
at	1
intimacy	1
on	1
their	1
side,	1
Elinor	1
principally	1
attributed	1
that	1
preference	1
of	1
herself	1
which	1
soon	1
became	1
evident	1
in	1
the	1
manners	1
of	1
both,	1
but	1
especially	1
of	1
Lucy,	1
who	1
missed	1
no	1
opportunity	1
of	1
engaging	1
her	1
in	1
conversation,	1
or	1
of	1
striving	1
to	1
improve	1
their	1
acquaintance	1
by	1
an	1
easy	1
and	1
frank	1
communication	1
of	1
her	1
sentiments.	1
Lucy	1
was	1
naturally	1
clever;	1
her	1
remarks	1
were	1
often	1
just	1
and	1
amusing;	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
companion	1
for	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
Elinor	1
frequently	1
found	1
her	1
agreeable;	1
but	1
her	1
powers	1
had	1
received	1
no	1
aid	1
from	1
education:	1
she	1
was	1
ignorant	1
and	1
illiterate;	1
and	1
her	1
deficiency	1
of	1
all	1
mental	1
improvement,	1
her	1
want	1
of	1
information	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
common	1
particulars,	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
concealed	1
from	1
Miss	1
Dashwood,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
her	1
constant	1
endeavour	1
to	1
appear	1
to	1
advantage.	1
Elinor	1
saw,	1
and	1
pitied	1
her	1
for,	1
the	1
neglect	1
of	1
abilities	1
which	1
education	1
might	1
have	1
rendered	1
so	1
respectable;	1
but	1
she	1
saw,	1
with	1
less	1
tenderness	1
of	1
feeling,	1
the	1
thorough	1
want	1
of	1
delicacy,	1
of	1
rectitude,	1
and	1
integrity	1
of	1
mind,	1
which	1
her	1
attentions,	1
her	1
assiduities,	1
her	1
flatteries	1
at	1
the	1
Park	1
betrayed;	1
and	1
she	1
could	1
have	1
no	1
lasting	1
satisfaction	1
in	1
the	1
company	1
of	1
a	1
person	1
who	1
joined	1
insincerity	1
with	1
ignorance;	1
whose	1
want	1
of	1
instruction	1
prevented	1
their	1
meeting	1
in	1
conversation	1
on	1
terms	1
of	1
equality,	1
and	1
whose	1
conduct	1
toward	1
others	1
made	1
every	1
shew	1
of	1
attention	1
and	1
deference	1
towards	1
herself	1
perfectly	1
valueless.	1
"You	1
will	1
think	1
my	1
question	1
an	1
odd	1
one,	1
I	1
dare	1
say,"	1
said	1
Lucy	1
to	1
her	1
one	1
day,	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
walking	1
together	1
from	1
the	1
park	1
to	1
the	1
cottage--"but	1
pray,	1
are	1
you	1
personally	1
acquainted	1
with	1
your	1
sister-in-law's	1
mother,	1
Mrs.	1
Ferrars?"	1
Elinor	1
DID	1
think	1
the	1
question	1
a	1
very	1
odd	1
one,	1
and	1
her	1
countenance	1
expressed	1
it,	1
as	1
she	1
answered	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
Mrs.	1
Ferrars.	1
"Indeed!"	1
replied	1
Lucy;	1
"I	1
wonder	1
at	1
that,	1
for	1
I	1
thought	1
you	1
must	1
have	1
seen	1
her	1
at	1
Norland	1
sometimes.	1
Then,	1
perhaps,	1
you	1
cannot	1
tell	1
me	1
what	1
sort	1
of	1
a	1
woman	1
she	1
is?"	1
"No,"	1
returned	1
Elinor,	1
cautious	1
of	1
giving	1
her	1
real	1
opinion	1
of	1
Edward's	1
mother,	1
and	1
not	1
very	1
desirous	1
of	1
satisfying	1
what	1
seemed	1
impertinent	1
curiosity--	1
"I	1
know	1
nothing	1
of	1
her."	1
"I	1
am	1
sure	1
you	1
think	1
me	1
very	1
strange,	1
for	1
enquiring	1
about	1
her	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
way,"	1
said	1
Lucy,	1
eyeing	1
Elinor	1
attentively	1
as	1
she	1
spoke;	1
"but	1
perhaps	1
there	1
may	1
be	1
reasons--I	1
wish	1
I	1
might	1
venture;	1
but	1
however	1
I	1
hope	1
you	1
will	1
do	1
me	1
the	1
justice	1
of	1
believing	1
that	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
mean	1
to	1
be	1
impertinent."	1
Elinor	1
made	1
her	1
a	1
civil	1
reply,	1
and	1
they	1
walked	1
on	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
in	1
silence.	1
It	1
was	1
broken	1
by	1
Lucy,	1
who	1
renewed	1
the	1
subject	1
again	1
by	1
saying,	1
with	1
some	1
hesitation,	1
"I	1
cannot	1
bear	1
to	1
have	1
you	1
think	1
me	1
impertinently	1
curious.	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
I	1
would	1
rather	1
do	1
any	1
thing	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
than	1
be	1
thought	1
so	1
by	1
a	1
person	1
whose	1
good	1
opinion	1
is	1
so	1
well	1
worth	1
having	1
as	1
yours.	1
And	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
the	1
smallest	1
fear	1
of	1
trusting	1
YOU;	1
indeed,	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
very	1
glad	1
of	1
your	1
advice	1
how	1
to	1
manage	1
in	1
such	1
and	1
uncomfortable	1
situation	1
as	1
I	1
am;	1
but,	1
however,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
occasion	1
to	1
trouble	1
YOU.	1
I	1
am	1
sorry	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
happen	1
to	1
know	1
Mrs.	1
Ferrars."	1
"I	1
am	1
sorry	1
I	1
do	1
NOT,"	1
said	1
Elinor,	1
in	1
great	1
astonishment,	1
"if	1
it	1
could	1
be	1
of	1
any	1
use	1
to	1
YOU	1
to	1
know	1
my	1
opinion	1
of	1
her.	1
But	1
really	1
I	1
never	1
understood	1
that	1
you	1
were	1
at	1
all	1
connected	1
with	1
that	1
family,	1
and	1
therefore	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
little	1
surprised,	1
I	1
confess,	1
at	1
so	1
serious	1
an	1
inquiry	1
into	1
her	1
character."	1
"I	1
dare	1
say	1
you	1
are,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
wonder	1
at	1
it.	1
But	1
if	1
I	1
dared	1
tell	1
you	1
all,	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
so	1
much	1
surprised.	1
Mrs.	1
Ferrars	1
is	1
certainly	1
nothing	1
to	1
me	1
at	1
present--but	1
the	1
time	1
MAY	1
come--how	1
soon	1
it	1
will	1
come	1
must	1
depend	1
upon	1
herself--when	1
we	1
may	1
be	1
very	1
intimately	1
connected."	1
She	1
looked	1
down	1
as	1
she	1
said	1
this,	1
amiably	1
bashful,	1
with	1
only	1
one	1
side	1
glance	1
at	1
her	1
companion	1
to	1
observe	1
its	1
effect	1
on	1
her.	1
"Good	1
heavens!"	1
cried	1
Elinor,	1
"what	1
do	1
you	1
mean?	1
Are	1
you	1
acquainted	1
with	1
Mr.	1
Robert	1
Ferrars?	1
Can	1
you	1
be?"	1
And	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
feel	1
much	1
delighted	1
with	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
sister-in-law.	1
"No,"	1
replied	1
Lucy,	1
"not	1
to	1
Mr.	1
ROBERT	1
Ferrars--I	1
never	1
saw	1
him	1
in	1
my	1
life;	1
but,"	1
fixing	1
her	1
eyes	1
upon	1
Elinor,	1
"to	1
his	1
eldest	1
brother."	1
What	1
felt	1
Elinor	1
at	1
that	1
moment?	1
Astonishment,	1
that	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
as	1
painful	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
strong,	1
had	1
not	1
an	1
immediate	1
disbelief	1
of	1
the	1
assertion	1
attended	1
it.	1
She	1
turned	1
towards	1
Lucy	1
in	1
silent	1
amazement,	1
unable	1
to	1
divine	1
the	1
reason	1
or	1
object	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
declaration;	1
and	1
though	1
her	1
complexion	1
varied,	1
she	1
stood	1
firm	1
in	1
incredulity,	1
and	1
felt	1
in	1
no	1
danger	1
of	1
an	1
hysterical	1
fit,	1
or	1
a	1
swoon.	1
"You	1
may	1
well	1
be	1
surprised,"	1
continued	1
Lucy;	1
"for	1
to	1
be	1
sure	1
you	1
could	1
have	1
had	1
no	1
idea	1
of	1
it	1
before;	1
for	1
I	1
dare	1
say	1
he	1
never	1
dropped	1
the	1
smallest	1
hint	1
of	1
it	1
to	1
you	1
or	1
any	1
of	1
your	1
family;	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
always	1
meant	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
great	1
secret,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
has	1
been	1
faithfully	1
kept	1
so	1
by	1
me	1
to	1
this	1
hour.	1
Not	1
a	1
soul	1
of	1
all	1
my	1
relations	1
know	1
of	1
it	1
but	1
Anne,	1
and	1
I	1
never	1
should	1
have	1
mentioned	1
it	1
to	1
you,	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
felt	1
the	1
greatest	1
dependence	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
upon	1
your	1
secrecy;	1
and	1
I	1
really	1
thought	1
my	1
behaviour	1
in	1
asking	1
so	1
many	1
questions	1
about	1
Mrs.	1
Ferrars	1
must	1
seem	1
so	1
odd,	1
that	1
it	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
explained.	1
And	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
Mr.	1
Ferrars	1
can	1
be	1
displeased,	1
when	1
he	1
knows	1
I	1
have	1
trusted	1
you,	1
because	1
I	1
know	1
he	1
has	1
the	1
highest	1
opinion	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
of	1
all	1
your	1
family,	1
and	1
looks	1
upon	1
yourself	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
Miss	1
Dashwoods	1
quite	1
as	1
his	1
own	1
sisters."--She	1
paused.	1
Elinor	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
moments	1
remained	1
silent.	1
Her	1
astonishment	1
at	1
what	1
she	1
heard	1
was	1
at	1
first	1
too	1
great	1
for	1
words;	1
but	1
at	1
length	1
forcing	1
herself	1
to	1
speak,	1
and	1
to	1
speak	1
cautiously,	1
she	1
said,	1
with	1
calmness	1
of	1
manner,	1
which	1
tolerably	1
well	1
concealed	1
her	1
surprise	1
and	1
solicitude--	1
"May	1
I	1
ask	1
if	1
your	1
engagement	1
is	1
of	1
long	1
standing?"	1
"We	1
have	1
been	1
engaged	1
these	1
four	1
years."	1
"Four	1
years!"	1
"Yes."	1
Elinor,	1
though	1
greatly	1
shocked,	1
still	1
felt	1
unable	1
to	1
believe	1
it.	1
"I	1
did	1
not	1
know,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"that	1
you	1
were	1
even	1
acquainted	1
till	1
the	1
other	1
day."	1
"Our	1
acquaintance,	1
however,	1
is	1
of	1
many	1
years	1
date.	1
He	1
was	1
under	1
my	1
uncle's	1
care,	1
you	1
know,	1
a	1
considerable	1
while."	1
"Your	1
uncle!"	1
"Yes;	1
Mr.	1
Pratt.	1
Did	1
you	1
never	1
hear	1
him	1
talk	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Pratt?"	1
"I	1
think	1
I	1
have,"	1
replied	1
Elinor,	1
with	1
an	1
exertion	1
of	1
spirits,	1
which	1
increased	1
with	1
her	1
increase	1
of	1
emotion.	1
"He	1
was	1
four	1
years	1
with	1
my	1
uncle,	1
who	1
lives	1
at	1
Longstaple,	1
near	1
Plymouth.	1
It	1
was	1
there	1
our	1
acquaintance	1
begun,	1
for	1
my	1
sister	1
and	1
me	1
was	1
often	1
staying	1
with	1
my	1
uncle,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
there	1
our	1
engagement	1
was	1
formed,	1
though	1
not	1
till	1
a	1
year	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
quitted	1
as	1
a	1
pupil;	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
almost	1
always	1
with	1
us	1
afterwards.	1
I	1
was	1
very	1
unwilling	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
it,	1
as	1
you	1
may	1
imagine,	1
without	1
the	1
knowledge	1
and	1
approbation	1
of	1
his	1
mother;	1
but	1
I	1
was	1
too	1
young,	1
and	1
loved	1
him	1
too	1
well,	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
prudent	1
as	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
been.--	1
Though	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
him	1
so	1
well	1
as	1
me,	1
Miss	1
Dashwood,	1
you	1
must	1
have	1
seen	1
enough	1
of	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
sensible	1
he	1
is	1
very	1
capable	1
of	1
making	1
a	1
woman	1
sincerely	1
attached	1
to	1
him."	1
"Certainly,"	1
answered	1
Elinor,	1
without	1
knowing	1
what	1
she	1
said;	1
but	1
after	1
a	1
moment's	1
reflection,	1
she	1
added,	1
with	1
revived	1
security	1
of	1
Edward's	1
honour	1
and	1
love,	1
and	1
her	1
companion's	1
falsehood--"Engaged	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Edward	1
Ferrars!--I	1
confess	1
myself	1
so	1
totally	1
surprised	1
at	1
what	1
you	1
tell	1
me,	1
that	1
really--I	1
beg	1
your	1
pardon;	1
but	1
surely	1
there	1
must	1
be	1
some	1
mistake	1
of	1
person	1
or	1
name.	1
We	1
cannot	1
mean	1
the	1
same	1
Mr.	1
Ferrars."	1
"We	1
can	1
mean	1
no	1
other,"	1
cried	1
Lucy,	1
smiling.	1
"Mr.	1
Edward	1
Ferrars,	1
the	1
eldest	1
son	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
Ferrars,	1
of	1
Park	1
Street,	1
and	1
brother	1
of	1
your	1
sister-in-law,	1
Mrs.	1
John	1
Dashwood,	1
is	1
the	1
person	1
I	1
mean;	1
you	1
must	1
allow	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
deceived	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
on	1
who	1
all	1
my	1
happiness	1
depends."	1
"It	1
is	1
strange,"	1
replied	1
Elinor,	1
in	1
a	1
most	1
painful	1
perplexity,	1
"that	1
I	1
should	1
never	1
have	1
heard	1
him	1
even	1
mention	1
your	1
name."	1
"No;	1
considering	1
our	1
situation,	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
strange.	1
Our	1
first	1
care	1
has	1
been	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
matter	1
secret.--	1
You	1
knew	1
nothing	1
of	1
me,	1
or	1
my	1
family,	1
and,	1
therefore,	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
no	1
OCCASION	1
for	1
ever	1
mentioning	1
my	1
name	1
to	1
you;	1
and,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
always	1
particularly	1
afraid	1
of	1
his	1
sister's	1
suspecting	1
any	1
thing,	1
THAT	1
was	1
reason	1
enough	1
for	1
his	1
not	1
mentioning	1
it."	1
She	1
was	1
silent.--Elinor's	1
security	1
sunk;	1
but	1
her	1
self-command	1
did	1
not	1
sink	1
with	1
it.	1
"Four	1
years	1
you	1
have	1
been	1
engaged,"	1
said	1
she	1
with	1
a	1
firm	1
voice.	1
"Yes;	1
and	1
heaven	1
knows	1
how	1
much	1
longer	1
we	1
may	1
have	1
to	1
wait.	1
Poor	1
Edward!	1
It	1
puts	1
him	1
quite	1
out	1
of	1
heart."	1
Then	1
taking	1
a	1
small	1
miniature	1
from	1
her	1
pocket,	1
she	1
added,	1
"To	1
prevent	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
mistake,	1
be	1
so	1
good	1
as	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
this	1
face.	1
It	1
does	1
not	1
do	1
him	1
justice,	1
to	1
be	1
sure,	1
but	1
yet	1
I	1
think	1
you	1
cannot	1
be	1
deceived	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
person	1
it	1
was	1
drew	1
for.--I	1
have	1
had	1
it	1
above	1
these	1
three	1
years."	1
She	1
put	1
it	1
into	1
her	1
hands	1
as	1
she	1
spoke;	1
and	1
when	1
Elinor	1
saw	1
the	1
painting,	1
whatever	1
other	1
doubts	1
her	1
fear	1
of	1
a	1
too	1
hasty	1
decision,	1
or	1
her	1
wish	1
of	1
detecting	1
falsehood	1
might	1
suffer	1
to	1
linger	1
in	1
her	1
mind,	1
she	1
could	1
have	1
none	1
of	1
its	1
being	1
Edward's	1
face.	1
She	1
returned	1
it	1
almost	1
instantly,	1
acknowledging	1
the	1
likeness.	1
"I	1
have	1
never	1
been	1
able,"	1
continued	1
Lucy,	1
"to	1
give	1
him	1
my	1
picture	1
in	1
return,	1
which	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
much	1
vexed	1
at,	1
for	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
always	1
so	1
anxious	1
to	1
get	1
it!	1
But	1
I	1
am	1
determined	1
to	1
set	1
for	1
it	1
the	1
very	1
first	1
opportunity."	1
"You	1
are	1
quite	1
in	1
the	1
right,"	1
replied	1
Elinor	1
calmly.	1
They	1
then	1
proceeded	1
a	1
few	1
paces	1
in	1
silence.	1
Lucy	1
spoke	1
first.	1
"I	1
am	1
sure,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"I	1
have	1
no	1
doubt	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
of	1
your	1
faithfully	1
keeping	1
this	1
secret,	1
because	1
you	1
must	1
know	1
of	1
what	1
importance	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
us,	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
it	1
reach	1
his	1
mother;	1
for	1
she	1
would	1
never	1
approve	1
of	1
it,	1
I	1
dare	1
say.	1
I	1
shall	1
have	1
no	1
fortune,	1
and	1
I	1
fancy	1
she	1
is	1
an	1
exceeding	1
proud	1
woman."	1
"I	1
certainly	1
did	1
not	1
seek	1
your	1
confidence,"	1
said	1
Elinor;	1
"but	1
you	1
do	1
me	1
no	1
more	1
than	1
justice	1
in	1
imagining	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
depended	1
on.	1
Your	1
secret	1
is	1
safe	1
with	1
me;	1
but	1
pardon	1
me	1
if	1
I	1
express	1
some	1
surprise	1
at	1
so	1
unnecessary	1
a	1
communication.	1
You	1
must	1
at	1
least	1
have	1
felt	1
that	1
my	1
being	1
acquainted	1
with	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
add	1
to	1
its	1
safety."	1
As	1
she	1
said	1
this,	1
she	1
looked	1
earnestly	1
at	1
Lucy,	1
hoping	1
to	1
discover	1
something	1
in	1
her	1
countenance;	1
perhaps	1
the	1
falsehood	1
of	1
the	1
greatest	1
part	1
of	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
saying;	1
but	1
Lucy's	1
countenance	1
suffered	1
no	1
change.	1
"I	1
was	1
afraid	1
you	1
would	1
think	1
I	1
was	1
taking	1
a	1
great	1
liberty	1
with	1
you,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"in	1
telling	1
you	1
all	1
this.	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
known	1
you	1
long	1
to	1
be	1
sure,	1
personally	1
at	1
least,	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
known	1
you	1
and	1
all	1
your	1
family	1
by	1
description	1
a	1
great	1
while;	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
I	1
saw	1
you,	1
I	1
felt	1
almost	1
as	1
if	1
you	1
was	1
an	1
old	1
acquaintance.	1
Besides	1
in	1
the	1
present	1
case,	1
I	1
really	1
thought	1
some	1
explanation	1
was	1
due	1
to	1
you	1
after	1
my	1
making	1
such	1
particular	1
inquiries	1
about	1
Edward's	1
mother;	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
so	1
unfortunate,	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
a	1
creature	1
whose	1
advice	1
I	1
can	1
ask.	1
Anne	1
is	1
the	1
only	1
person	1
that	1
knows	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
she	1
has	1
no	1
judgment	1
at	1
all;	1
indeed,	1
she	1
does	1
me	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
more	1
harm	1
than	1
good,	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
constant	1
fear	1
of	1
her	1
betraying	1
me.	1
She	1
does	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
hold	1
her	1
tongue,	1
as	1
you	1
must	1
perceive,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
greatest	1
fright	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
t'other	1
day,	1
when	1
Edward's	1
name	1
was	1
mentioned	1
by	1
Sir	1
John,	1
lest	1
she	1
should	1
out	1
with	1
it	1
all.	1
You	1
can't	1
think	1
how	1
much	1
I	1
go	1
through	1
in	1
my	1
mind	1
from	1
it	1
altogether.	1
I	1
only	1
wonder	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
alive	1
after	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
suffered	1
for	1
Edward's	1
sake	1
these	1
last	1
four	1
years.	1
Every	1
thing	1
in	1
such	1
suspense	1
and	1
uncertainty;	1
and	1
seeing	1
him	1
so	1
seldom--we	1
can	1
hardly	1
meet	1
above	1
twice	1
a-year.	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
I	1
wonder	1
my	1
heart	1
is	1
not	1
quite	1
broke."	1
Here	1
she	1
took	1
out	1
her	1
handkerchief;	1
but	1
Elinor	1
did	1
not	1
feel	1
very	1
compassionate.	1
"Sometimes."	1
continued	1
Lucy,	1
after	1
wiping	1
her	1
eyes,	1
"I	1
think	1
whether	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
better	1
for	1
us	1
both	1
to	1
break	1
off	1
the	1
matter	1
entirely."	1
As	1
she	1
said	1
this,	1
she	1
looked	1
directly	1
at	1
her	1
companion.	1
"But	1
then	1
at	1
other	1
times	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
resolution	1
enough	1
for	1
it.--	1
I	1
cannot	1
bear	1
the	1
thoughts	1
of	1
making	1
him	1
so	1
miserable,	1
as	1
I	1
know	1
the	1
very	1
mention	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
thing	1
would	1
do.	1
And	1
on	1
my	1
own	1
account	1
too--so	1
dear	1
as	1
he	1
is	1
to	1
me--I	1
don't	1
think	1
I	1
could	1
be	1
equal	1
to	1
it.	1
What	1
would	1
you	1
advise	1
me	1
to	1
do	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
case,	1
Miss	1
Dashwood?	1
What	1
would	1
you	1
do	1
yourself?"	1
"Pardon	1
me,"	1
replied	1
Elinor,	1
startled	1
by	1
the	1
question;	1
"but	1
I	1
can	1
give	1
you	1
no	1
advice	1
under	1
such	1
circumstances.	1
Your	1
own	1
judgment	1
must	1
direct	1
you."	1
"To	1
be	1
sure,"	1
continued	1
Lucy,	1
after	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
silence	1
on	1
both	1
sides,	1
"his	1
mother	1
must	1
provide	1
for	1
him	1
sometime	1
or	1
other;	1
but	1
poor	1
Edward	1
is	1
so	1
cast	1
down	1
by	1
it!	1
Did	1
you	1
not	1
think	1
him	1
dreadful	1
low-spirited	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
Barton?	1
He	1
was	1
so	1
miserable	1
when	1
he	1
left	1
us	1
at	1
Longstaple,	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
you,	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
afraid	1
you	1
would	1
think	1
him	1
quite	1
ill."	1
"Did	1
he	1
come	1
from	1
your	1
uncle's,	1
then,	1
when	1
he	1
visited	1
us?"	1
"Oh,	1
yes;	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
staying	1
a	1
fortnight	1
with	1
us.	1
Did	1
you	1
think	1
he	1
came	1
directly	1
from	1
town?"	1
"No,"	1
replied	1
Elinor,	1
most	1
feelingly	1
sensible	1
of	1
every	1
fresh	1
circumstance	1
in	1
favour	1
of	1
Lucy's	1
veracity;	1
"I	1
remember	1
he	1
told	1
us,	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
staying	1
a	1
fortnight	1
with	1
some	1
friends	1
near	1
Plymouth."	1
She	1
remembered	1
too,	1
her	1
own	1
surprise	1
at	1
the	1
time,	1
at	1
his	1
mentioning	1
nothing	1
farther	1
of	1
those	1
friends,	1
at	1
his	1
total	1
silence	1
with	1
respect	1
even	1
to	1
their	1
names.	1
"Did	1
not	1
you	1
think	1
him	1
sadly	1
out	1
of	1
spirits?"	1
repeated	1
Lucy.	1
"We	1
did,	1
indeed,	1
particularly	1
so	1
when	1
he	1
first	1
arrived."	1
"I	1
begged	1
him	1
to	1
exert	1
himself	1
for	1
fear	1
you	1
should	1
suspect	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
matter;	1
but	1
it	1
made	1
him	1
so	1
melancholy,	1
not	1
being	1
able	1
to	1
stay	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
fortnight	1
with	1
us,	1
and	1
seeing	1
me	1
so	1
much	1
affected.--	1
Poor	1
fellow!--I	1
am	1
afraid	1
it	1
is	1
just	1
the	1
same	1
with	1
him	1
now;	1
for	1
he	1
writes	1
in	1
wretched	1
spirits.	1
I	1
heard	1
from	1
him	1
just	1
before	1
I	1
left	1
Exeter;"	1
taking	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
her	1
pocket	1
and	1
carelessly	1
showing	1
the	1
direction	1
to	1
Elinor.	1
"You	1
know	1
his	1
hand,	1
I	1
dare	1
say,	1
a	1
charming	1
one	1
it	1
is;	1
but	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
written	1
so	1
well	1
as	1
usual.--He	1
was	1
tired,	1
I	1
dare	1
say,	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
just	1
filled	1
the	1
sheet	1
to	1
me	1
as	1
full	1
as	1
possible."	1
Elinor	1
saw	1
that	1
it	1
WAS	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
she	1
could	1
doubt	1
no	1
longer.	1
This	1
picture,	1
she	1
had	1
allowed	1
herself	1
to	1
believe,	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
accidentally	1
obtained;	1
it	1
might	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
Edward's	1
gift;	1
but	1
a	1
correspondence	1
between	1
them	1
by	1
letter,	1
could	1
subsist	1
only	1
under	1
a	1
positive	1
engagement,	1
could	1
be	1
authorised	1
by	1
nothing	1
else;	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
moments,	1
she	1
was	1
almost	1
overcome--her	1
heart	1
sunk	1
within	1
her,	1
and	1
she	1
could	1
hardly	1
stand;	1
but	1
exertion	1
was	1
indispensably	1
necessary;	1
and	1
she	1
struggled	1
so	1
resolutely	1
against	1
the	1
oppression	1
of	1
her	1
feelings,	1
that	1
her	1
success	1
was	1
speedy,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
complete.	1
"Writing	1
to	1
each	1
other,"	1
said	1
Lucy,	1
returning	1
the	1
letter	1
into	1
her	1
pocket,	1
"is	1
the	1
only	1
comfort	1
we	1
have	1
in	1
such	1
long	1
separations.	1
Yes,	1
I	1
have	1
one	1
other	1
comfort	1
in	1
his	1
picture,	1
but	1
poor	1
Edward	1
has	1
not	1
even	1
THAT.	1
If	1
he	1
had	1
but	1
my	1
picture,	1
he	1
says	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
easy.	1
I	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
lock	1
of	1
my	1
hair	1
set	1
in	1
a	1
ring	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
Longstaple	1
last,	1
and	1
that	1
was	1
some	1
comfort	1
to	1
him,	1
he	1
said,	1
but	1
not	1
equal	1
to	1
a	1
picture.	1
Perhaps	1
you	1
might	1
notice	1
the	1
ring	1
when	1
you	1
saw	1
him?"	1
"I	1
did,"	1
said	1
Elinor,	1
with	1
a	1
composure	1
of	1
voice,	1
under	1
which	1
was	1
concealed	1
an	1
emotion	1
and	1
distress	1
beyond	1
any	1
thing	1
she	1
had	1
ever	1
felt	1
before.	1
She	1
was	1
mortified,	1
shocked,	1
confounded.	1
Fortunately	1
for	1
her,	1
they	1
had	1
now	1
reached	1
the	1
cottage,	1
and	1
the	1
conversation	1
could	1
be	1
continued	1
no	1
farther.	1
After	1
sitting	1
with	1
them	1
a	1
few	1
minutes,	1
the	1
Miss	1
Steeles	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
Park,	1
and	1
Elinor	1
was	1
then	1
at	1
liberty	1
to	1
think	1
and	1
be	1
wretched.	1

CHAPTER	1
23	1
However	1
small	1
Elinor's	1
general	1
dependence	1
on	1
Lucy's	1
veracity	1
might	1
be,	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
for	1
her	1
on	1
serious	1
reflection	1
to	1
suspect	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
present	1
case,	1
where	1
no	1
temptation	1
could	1
be	1
answerable	1
to	1
the	1
folly	1
of	1
inventing	1
a	1
falsehood	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
description.	1
What	1
Lucy	1
had	1
asserted	1
to	1
be	1
true,	1
therefore,	1
Elinor	1
could	1
not,	1
dared	1
not	1
longer	1
doubt;	1
supported	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
too	1
on	1
every	1
side	1
by	1
such	1
probabilities	1
and	1
proofs,	1
and	1
contradicted	1
by	1
nothing	1
but	1
her	1
own	1
wishes.	1
Their	1
opportunity	1
of	1
acquaintance	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Pratt	1
was	1
a	1
foundation	1
for	1
the	1
rest,	1
at	1
once	1
indisputable	1
and	1
alarming;	1
and	1
Edward's	1
visit	1
near	1
Plymouth,	1
his	1
melancholy	1
state	1
of	1
mind,	1
his	1
dissatisfaction	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
prospects,	1
his	1
uncertain	1
behaviour	1
towards	1
herself,	1
the	1
intimate	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
Miss	1
Steeles	1
as	1
to	1
Norland	1
and	1
their	1
family	1
connections,	1
which	1
had	1
often	1
surprised	1
her,	1
the	1
picture,	1
the	1
letter,	1
the	1
ring,	1
formed	1
altogether	1
such	1
a	1
body	1
of	1
evidence,	1
as	1
overcame	1
every	1
fear	1
of	1
condemning	1
him	1
unfairly,	1
and	1
established	1
as	1
a	1
fact,	1
which	1
no	1
partiality	1
could	1
set	1
aside,	1
his	1
ill-treatment	1
of	1
herself.--Her	1
resentment	1
of	1
such	1
behaviour,	1
her	1
indignation	1
at	1
having	1
been	1
its	1
dupe,	1
for	1
a	1
short	1
time	1
made	1
her	1
feel	1
only	1
for	1
herself;	1
but	1
other	1
ideas,	1
other	1
considerations,	1
soon	1
arose.	1
Had	1
Edward	1
been	1
intentionally	1
deceiving	1
her?	1
Had	1
he	1
feigned	1
a	1
regard	1
for	1
her	1
which	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
feel?	1
Was	1
his	1
engagement	1
to	1
Lucy	1
an	1
engagement	1
of	1
the	1
heart?	1
No;	1
whatever	1
it	1
might	1
once	1
have	1
been,	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
believe	1
it	1
such	1
at	1
present.	1
His	1
affection	1
was	1
all	1
her	1
own.	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
deceived	1
in	1
that.	1
Her	1
mother,	1
sisters,	1
Fanny,	1
all	1
had	1
been	1
conscious	1
of	1
his	1
regard	1
for	1
her	1
at	1
Norland;	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
an	1
illusion	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
vanity.	1
He	1
certainly	1
loved	1
her.	1
What	1
a	1
softener	1
of	1
the	1
heart	1
was	1
this	1
persuasion!	1
How	1
much	1
could	1
it	1
not	1
tempt	1
her	1
to	1
forgive!	1
He	1
had	1
been	1
blamable,	1
highly	1
blamable,	1
in	1
remaining	1
at	1
Norland	1
after	1
he	1
first	1
felt	1
her	1
influence	1
over	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
more	1
than	1
it	1
ought	1
to	1
be.	1
In	1
that,	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
defended;	1
but	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
injured	1
her,	1
how	1
much	1
more	1
had	1
he	1
injured	1
himself;	1
if	1
her	1
case	1
were	1
pitiable,	1
his	1
was	1
hopeless.	1
His	1
imprudence	1
had	1
made	1
her	1
miserable	1
for	1
a	1
while;	1
but	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
deprived	1
himself	1
of	1
all	1
chance	1
of	1
ever	1
being	1
otherwise.	1
She	1
might	1
in	1
time	1
regain	1
tranquillity;	1
but	1
HE,	1
what	1
had	1
he	1
to	1
look	1
forward	1
to?	1
Could	1
he	1
ever	1
be	1
tolerably	1
happy	1
with	1
Lucy	1
Steele;	1
could	1
he,	1
were	1
his	1
affection	1
for	1
herself	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
question,	1
with	1
his	1
integrity,	1
his	1
delicacy,	1
and	1
well-informed	1
mind,	1
be	1
satisfied	1
with	1
a	1
wife	1
like	1
her--illiterate,	1
artful,	1
and	1
selfish?	1
The	1
youthful	1
infatuation	1
of	1
nineteen	1
would	1
naturally	1
blind	1
him	1
to	1
every	1
thing	1
but	1
her	1
beauty	1
and	1
good	1
nature;	1
but	1
the	1
four	1
succeeding	1
years--years,	1
which	1
if	1
rationally	1
spent,	1
give	1
such	1
improvement	1
to	1
the	1
understanding,	1
must	1
have	1
opened	1
his	1
eyes	1
to	1
her	1
defects	1
of	1
education,	1
while	1
the	1
same	1
period	1
of	1
time,	1
spent	1
on	1
her	1
side	1
in	1
inferior	1
society	1
and	1
more	1
frivolous	1
pursuits,	1
had	1
perhaps	1
robbed	1
her	1
of	1
that	1
simplicity	1
which	1
might	1
once	1
have	1
given	1
an	1
interesting	1
character	1
to	1
her	1
beauty.	1
If	1
in	1
the	1
supposition	1
of	1
his	1
seeking	1
to	1
marry	1
herself,	1
his	1
difficulties	1
from	1
his	1
mother	1
had	1
seemed	1
great,	1
how	1
much	1
greater	1
were	1
they	1
now	1
likely	1
to	1
be,	1
when	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
his	1
engagement	1
was	1
undoubtedly	1
inferior	1
in	1
connections,	1
and	1
probably	1
inferior	1
in	1
fortune	1
to	1
herself.	1
These	1
difficulties,	1
indeed,	1
with	1
a	1
heart	1
so	1
alienated	1
from	1
Lucy,	1
might	1
not	1
press	1
very	1
hard	1
upon	1
his	1
patience;	1
but	1
melancholy	1
was	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
the	1
person	1
by	1
whom	1
the	1
expectation	1
of	1
family	1
opposition	1
and	1
unkindness,	1
could	1
be	1
felt	1
as	1
a	1
relief!	1
As	1
these	1
considerations	1
occurred	1
to	1
her	1
in	1
painful	1
succession,	1
she	1
wept	1
for	1
him,	1
more	1
than	1
for	1
herself.	1
Supported	1
by	1
the	1
conviction	1
of	1
having	1
done	1
nothing	1
to	1
merit	1
her	1
present	1
unhappiness,	1
and	1
consoled	1
by	1
the	1
belief	1
that	1
Edward	1
had	1
done	1
nothing	1
to	1
forfeit	1
her	1
esteem,	1
she	1
thought	1
she	1
could	1
even	1
now,	1
under	1
the	1
first	1
smart	1
of	1
the	1
heavy	1
blow,	1
command	1
herself	1
enough	1
to	1
guard	1
every	1
suspicion	1
of	1
the	1
truth	1
from	1
her	1
mother	1
and	1
sisters.	1
And	1
so	1
well	1
was	1
she	1
able	1
to	1
answer	1
her	1
own	1
expectations,	1
that	1
when	1
she	1
joined	1
them	1
at	1
dinner	1
only	1
two	1
hours	1
after	1
she	1
had	1
first	1
suffered	1
the	1
extinction	1
of	1
all	1
her	1
dearest	1
hopes,	1
no	1
one	1
would	1
have	1
supposed	1
from	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
the	1
sisters,	1
that	1
Elinor	1
was	1
mourning	1
in	1
secret	1
over	1
obstacles	1
which	1
must	1
divide	1
her	1
for	1
ever	1
from	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
her	1
love,	1
and	1
that	1
Marianne	1
was	1
internally	1
dwelling	1
on	1
the	1
perfections	1
of	1
a	1
man,	1
of	1
whose	1
whole	1
heart	1
she	1
felt	1
thoroughly	1
possessed,	1
and	1
whom	1
she	1
expected	1
to	1
see	1
in	1
every	1
carriage	1
which	1
drove	1
near	1
their	1
house.	1
The	1
necessity	1
of	1
concealing	1
from	1
her	1
mother	1
and	1
Marianne,	1
what	1
had	1
been	1
entrusted	1
in	1
confidence	1
to	1
herself,	1
though	1
it	1
obliged	1
her	1
to	1
unceasing	1
exertion,	1
was	1
no	1
aggravation	1
of	1
Elinor's	1
distress.	1
On	1
the	1
contrary	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
relief	1
to	1
her,	1
to	1
be	1
spared	1
the	1
communication	1
of	1
what	1
would	1
give	1
such	1
affliction	1
to	1
them,	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
saved	1
likewise	1
from	1
hearing	1
that	1
condemnation	1
of	1
Edward,	1
which	1
would	1
probably	1
flow	1
from	1
the	1
excess	1
of	1
their	1
partial	1
affection	1
for	1
herself,	1
and	1
which	1
was	1
more	1
than	1
she	1
felt	1
equal	1
to	1
support.	1
From	1
their	1
counsel,	1
or	1
their	1
conversation,	1
she	1
knew	1
she	1
could	1
receive	1
no	1
assistance,	1
their	1
tenderness	1
and	1
sorrow	1
must	1
add	1
to	1
her	1
distress,	1
while	1
her	1
self-command	1
would	1
neither	1
receive	1
encouragement	1
from	1
their	1
example	1
nor	1
from	1
their	1
praise.	1
She	1
was	1
stronger	1
alone,	1
and	1
her	1
own	1
good	1
sense	1
so	1
well	1
supported	1
her,	1
that	1
her	1
firmness	1
was	1
as	1
unshaken,	1
her	1
appearance	1
of	1
cheerfulness	1
as	1
invariable,	1
as	1
with	1
regrets	1
so	1
poignant	1
and	1
so	1
fresh,	1
it	1
was	1
possible	1
for	1
them	1
to	1
be.	1
Much	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
suffered	1
from	1
her	1
first	1
conversation	1
with	1
Lucy	1
on	1
the	1
subject,	1
she	1
soon	1
felt	1
an	1
earnest	1
wish	1
of	1
renewing	1
it;	1
and	1
this	1
for	1
more	1
reasons	1
than	1
one.	1
She	1
wanted	1
to	1
hear	1
many	1
particulars	1
of	1
their	1
engagement	1
repeated	1
again,	1
she	1
wanted	1
more	1
clearly	1
to	1
understand	1
what	1
Lucy	1
really	1
felt	1
for	1
Edward,	1
whether	1
there	1
were	1
any	1
sincerity	1
in	1
her	1
declaration	1
of	1
tender	1
regard	1
for	1
him,	1
and	1
she	1
particularly	1
wanted	1
to	1
convince	1
Lucy,	1
by	1
her	1
readiness	1
to	1
enter	1
on	1
the	1
matter	1
again,	1
and	1
her	1
calmness	1
in	1
conversing	1
on	1
it,	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
no	1
otherwise	1
interested	1
in	1
it	1
than	1
as	1
a	1
friend,	1
which	1
she	1
very	1
much	1
feared	1
her	1
involuntary	1
agitation,	1
in	1
their	1
morning	1
discourse,	1
must	1
have	1
left	1
at	1
least	1
doubtful.	1
That	1
Lucy	1
was	1
disposed	1
to	1
be	1
jealous	1
of	1
her	1
appeared	1
very	1
probable:	1
it	1
was	1
plain	1
that	1
Edward	1
had	1
always	1
spoken	1
highly	1
in	1
her	1
praise,	1
not	1
merely	1
from	1
Lucy's	1
assertion,	1
but	1
from	1
her	1
venturing	1
to	1
trust	1
her	1
on	1
so	1
short	1
a	1
personal	1
acquaintance,	1
with	1
a	1
secret	1
so	1
confessedly	1
and	1
evidently	1
important.	1
And	1
even	1
Sir	1
John's	1
joking	1
intelligence	1
must	1
have	1
had	1
some	1
weight.	1
But	1
indeed,	1
while	1
Elinor	1
remained	1
so	1
well	1
assured	1
within	1
herself	1
of	1
being	1
really	1
beloved	1
by	1
Edward,	1
it	1
required	1
no	1
other	1
consideration	1
of	1
probabilities	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
natural	1
that	1
Lucy	1
should	1
be	1
jealous;	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
so,	1
her	1
very	1
confidence	1
was	1
a	1
proof.	1
What	1
other	1
reason	1
for	1
the	1
disclosure	1
of	1
the	1
affair	1
could	1
there	1
be,	1
but	1
that	1
Elinor	1
might	1
be	1
informed	1
by	1
it	1
of	1
Lucy's	1
superior	1
claims	1
on	1
Edward,	1
and	1
be	1
taught	1
to	1
avoid	1
him	1
in	1
future?	1
She	1
had	1
little	1
difficulty	1
in	1
understanding	1
thus	1
much	1
of	1
her	1
rival's	1
intentions,	1
and	1
while	1
she	1
was	1
firmly	1
resolved	1
to	1
act	1
by	1
her	1
as	1
every	1
principle	1
of	1
honour	1
and	1
honesty	1
directed,	1
to	1
combat	1
her	1
own	1
affection	1
for	1
Edward	1
and	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
as	1
little	1
as	1
possible;	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
deny	1
herself	1
the	1
comfort	1
of	1
endeavouring	1
to	1
convince	1
Lucy	1
that	1
her	1
heart	1
was	1
unwounded.	1
And	1
as	1
she	1
could	1
now	1
have	1
nothing	1
more	1
painful	1
to	1
hear	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
than	1
had	1
already	1
been	1
told,	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
mistrust	1
her	1
own	1
ability	1
of	1
going	1
through	1
a	1
repetition	1
of	1
particulars	1
with	1
composure.	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
immediately	1
that	1
an	1
opportunity	1
of	1
doing	1
so	1
could	1
be	1
commanded,	1
though	1
Lucy	1
was	1
as	1
well	1
disposed	1
as	1
herself	1
to	1
take	1
advantage	1
of	1
any	1
that	1
occurred;	1
for	1
the	1
weather	1
was	1
not	1
often	1
fine	1
enough	1
to	1
allow	1
of	1
their	1
joining	1
in	1
a	1
walk,	1
where	1
they	1
might	1
most	1
easily	1
separate	1
themselves	1
from	1
the	1
others;	1
and	1
though	1
they	1
met	1
at	1
least	1
every	1
other	1
evening	1
either	1
at	1
the	1
park	1
or	1
cottage,	1
and	1
chiefly	1
at	1
the	1
former,	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
supposed	1
to	1
meet	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
conversation.	1
Such	1
a	1
thought	1
would	1
never	1
enter	1
either	1
Sir	1
John	1
or	1
Lady	1
Middleton's	1
head;	1
and	1
therefore	1
very	1
little	1
leisure	1
was	1
ever	1
given	1
for	1
a	1
general	1
chat,	1
and	1
none	1
at	1
all	1
for	1
particular	1
discourse.	1
They	1
met	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
eating,	1
drinking,	1
and	1
laughing	1
together,	1
playing	1
at	1
cards,	1
or	1
consequences,	1
or	1
any	1
other	1
game	1
that	1
was	1
sufficiently	1
noisy.	1
One	1
or	1
two	1
meetings	1
of	1
this	1
kind	1
had	1
taken	1
place,	1
without	1
affording	1
Elinor	1
any	1
chance	1
of	1
engaging	1
Lucy	1
in	1
private,	1
when	1
Sir	1
John	1
called	1
at	1
the	1
cottage	1
one	1
morning,	1
to	1
beg,	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
charity,	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
all	1
dine	1
with	1
Lady	1
Middleton	1
that	1
day,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
attend	1
the	1
club	1
at	1
Exeter,	1
and	1
she	1
would	1
otherwise	1
be	1
quite	1
alone,	1
except	1
her	1
mother	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
Miss	1
Steeles.	1
Elinor,	1
who	1
foresaw	1
a	1
fairer	1
opening	1
for	1
the	1
point	1
she	1
had	1
in	1
view,	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
party	1
as	1
this	1
was	1
likely	1
to	1
be,	1
more	1
at	1
liberty	1
among	1
themselves	1
under	1
the	1
tranquil	1
and	1
well-bred	1
direction	1
of	1
Lady	1
Middleton	1
than	1
when	1
her	1
husband	1
united	1
them	1
together	1
in	1
one	1
noisy	1
purpose,	1
immediately	1
accepted	1
the	1
invitation;	1
Margaret,	1
with	1
her	1
mother's	1
permission,	1
was	1
equally	1
compliant,	1
and	1
Marianne,	1
though	1
always	1
unwilling	1
to	1
join	1
any	1
of	1
their	1
parties,	1
was	1
persuaded	1
by	1
her	1
mother,	1
who	1
could	1
not	1
bear	1
to	1
have	1
her	1
seclude	1
herself	1
from	1
any	1
chance	1
of	1
amusement,	1
to	1
go	1
likewise.	1
The	1
young	1
ladies	1
went,	1
and	1
Lady	1
Middleton	1
was	1
happily	1
preserved	1
from	1
the	1
frightful	1
solitude	1
which	1
had	1
threatened	1
her.	1
The	1
insipidity	1
of	1
the	1
meeting	1
was	1
exactly	1
such	1
as	1
Elinor	1
had	1
expected;	1
it	1
produced	1
not	1
one	1
novelty	1
of	1
thought	1
or	1
expression,	1
and	1
nothing	1
could	1
be	1
less	1
interesting	1
than	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
their	1
discourse	1
both	1
in	1
the	1
dining	1
parlour	1
and	1
drawing	1
room:	1
to	1
the	1
latter,	1
the	1
children	1
accompanied	1
them,	1
and	1
while	1
they	1
remained	1
there,	1
she	1
was	1
too	1
well	1
convinced	1
of	1
the	1
impossibility	1
of	1
engaging	1
Lucy's	1
attention	1
to	1
attempt	1
it.	1
They	1
quitted	1
it	1
only	1
with	1
the	1
removal	1
of	1
the	1
tea-things.	1
The	1
card-table	1
was	1
then	1
placed,	1
and	1
Elinor	1
began	1
to	1
wonder	1
at	1
herself	1
for	1
having	1
ever	1
entertained	1
a	1
hope	1
of	1
finding	1
time	1
for	1
conversation	1
at	1
the	1
park.	1
They	1
all	1
rose	1
up	1
in	1
preparation	1
for	1
a	1
round	1
game.	1
"I	1
am	1
glad,"	1
said	1
Lady	1
Middleton	1
to	1
Lucy,	1
"you	1
are	1
not	1
going	1
to	1
finish	1
poor	1
little	1
Annamaria's	1
basket	1
this	1
evening;	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
it	1
must	1
hurt	1
your	1
eyes	1
to	1
work	1
filigree	1
by	1
candlelight.	1
And	1
we	1
will	1
make	1
the	1
dear	1
little	1
love	1
some	1
amends	1
for	1
her	1
disappointment	1
to-morrow,	1
and	1
then	1
I	1
hope	1
she	1
will	1
not	1
much	1
mind	1
it."	1
This	1
hint	1
was	1
enough,	1
Lucy	1
recollected	1
herself	1
instantly	1
and	1
replied,	1
"Indeed	1
you	1
are	1
very	1
much	1
mistaken,	1
Lady	1
Middleton;	1
I	1
am	1
only	1
waiting	1
to	1
know	1
whether	1
you	1
can	1
make	1
your	1
party	1
without	1
me,	1
or	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
at	1
my	1
filigree	1
already.	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
disappoint	1
the	1
little	1
angel	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
world:	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
want	1
me	1
at	1
the	1
card-table	1
now,	1
I	1
am	1
resolved	1
to	1
finish	1
the	1
basket	1
after	1
supper."	1
"You	1
are	1
very	1
good,	1
I	1
hope	1
it	1
won't	1
hurt	1
your	1
eyes--	1
will	1
you	1
ring	1
the	1
bell	1
for	1
some	1
working	1
candles?	1
My	1
poor	1
little	1
girl	1
would	1
be	1
sadly	1
disappointed,	1
I	1
know,	1
if	1
the	1
basket	1
was	1
not	1
finished	1
tomorrow,	1
for	1
though	1
I	1
told	1
her	1
it	1
certainly	1
would	1
not,	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
she	1
depends	1
upon	1
having	1
it	1
done."	1
Lucy	1
directly	1
drew	1
her	1
work	1
table	1
near	1
her	1
and	1
reseated	1
herself	1
with	1
an	1
alacrity	1
and	1
cheerfulness	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
infer	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
taste	1
no	1
greater	1
delight	1
than	1
in	1
making	1
a	1
filigree	1
basket	1
for	1
a	1
spoilt	1
child.	1
Lady	1
Middleton	1
proposed	1
a	1
rubber	1
of	1
Casino	1
to	1
the	1
others.	1
No	1
one	1
made	1
any	1
objection	1
but	1
Marianne,	1
who	1
with	1
her	1
usual	1
inattention	1
to	1
the	1
forms	1
of	1
general	1
civility,	1
exclaimed,	1
"Your	1
Ladyship	1
will	1
have	1
the	1
goodness	1
to	1
excuse	1
ME--you	1
know	1
I	1
detest	1
cards.	1
I	1
shall	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
piano-forte;	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
touched	1
it	1
since	1
it	1
was	1
tuned."	1
And	1
without	1
farther	1
ceremony,	1
she	1
turned	1
away	1
and	1
walked	1
to	1
the	1
instrument.	1
Lady	1
Middleton	1
looked	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
thanked	1
heaven	1
that	1
SHE	1
had	1
never	1
made	1
so	1
rude	1
a	1
speech.	1
"Marianne	1
can	1
never	1
keep	1
long	1
from	1
that	1
instrument	1
you	1
know,	1
ma'am,"	1
said	1
Elinor,	1
endeavouring	1
to	1
smooth	1
away	1
the	1
offence;	1
"and	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
much	1
wonder	1
at	1
it;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
very	1
best	1
toned	1
piano-forte	1
I	1
ever	1
heard."	1
The	1
remaining	1
five	1
were	1
now	1
to	1
draw	1
their	1
cards.	1
"Perhaps,"	1
continued	1
Elinor,	1
"if	1
I	1
should	1
happen	1
to	1
cut	1
out,	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
of	1
some	1
use	1
to	1
Miss	1
Lucy	1
Steele,	1
in	1
rolling	1
her	1
papers	1
for	1
her;	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
so	1
much	1
still	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
to	1
the	1
basket,	1
that	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
impossible	1
I	1
think	1
for	1
her	1
labour	1
singly,	1
to	1
finish	1
it	1
this	1
evening.	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
the	1
work	1
exceedingly,	1
if	1
she	1
would	1
allow	1
me	1
a	1
share	1
in	1
it."	1
"Indeed	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
very	1
much	1
obliged	1
to	1
you	1
for	1
your	1
help,"	1
cried	1
Lucy,	1
"for	1
I	1
find	1
there	1
is	1
more	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
to	1
it	1
than	1
I	1
thought	1
there	1
was;	1
and	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
shocking	1
thing	1
to	1
disappoint	1
dear	1
Annamaria	1
after	1
all."	1
"Oh!	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
terrible,	1
indeed,"	1
said	1
Miss	1
Steele--	1
"Dear	1
little	1
soul,	1
how	1
I	1
do	1
love	1
her!"	1
"You	1
are	1
very	1
kind,"	1
said	1
Lady	1
Middleton	1
to	1
Elinor;	1
"and	1
as	1
you	1
really	1
like	1
the	1
work,	1
perhaps	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
as	1
well	1
pleased	1
not	1
to	1
cut	1
in	1
till	1
another	1
rubber,	1
or	1
will	1
you	1
take	1
your	1
chance	1
now?"	1
Elinor	1
joyfully	1
profited	1
by	1
the	1
first	1
of	1
these	1
proposals,	1
and	1
thus	1
by	1
a	1
little	1
of	1
that	1
address	1
which	1
Marianne	1
could	1
never	1
condescend	1
to	1
practise,	1
gained	1
her	1
own	1
end,	1
and	1
pleased	1
Lady	1
Middleton	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time.	1
Lucy	1
made	1
room	1
for	1
her	1
with	1
ready	1
attention,	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
fair	1
rivals	1
were	1
thus	1
seated	1
side	1
by	1
side	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
table,	1
and,	1
with	1
the	1
utmost	1
harmony,	1
engaged	1
in	1
forwarding	1
the	1
same	1
work.	1
The	1
pianoforte	1
at	1
which	1
Marianne,	1
wrapped	1
up	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
music	1
and	1
her	1
own	1
thoughts,	1
had	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
forgotten	1
that	1
any	1
body	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
besides	1
herself,	1
was	1
luckily	1
so	1
near	1
them	1
that	1
Miss	1
Dashwood	1
now	1
judged	1
she	1
might	1
safely,	1
under	1
the	1
shelter	1
of	1
its	1
noise,	1
introduce	1
the	1
interesting	1
subject,	1
without	1
any	1
risk	1
of	1
being	1
heard	1
at	1
the	1
card-table.	1
CHAPTER	1
24	1
In	1
a	1
firm,	1
though	1
cautious	1
tone,	1
Elinor	1
thus	1
began.	1
"I	1
should	1
be	1
undeserving	1
of	1
the	1
confidence	1
you	1
have	1
honoured	1
me	1
with,	1
if	1
I	1
felt	1
no	1
desire	1
for	1
its	1
continuance,	1
or	1
no	1
farther	1
curiosity	1
on	1
its	1
subject.	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
apologize	1
therefore	1
for	1
bringing	1
it	1
forward	1
again."	1
"Thank	1
you,"	1
cried	1
Lucy	1
warmly,	1
"for	1
breaking	1
the	1
ice;	1
you	1
have	1
set	1
my	1
heart	1
at	1
ease	1
by	1
it;	1
for	1
I	1
was	1
somehow	1
or	1
other	1
afraid	1
I	1
had	1
offended	1
you	1
by	1
what	1
I	1
told	1
you	1
that	1
Monday."	1
"Offended	1
me!	1
How	1
could	1
you	1
suppose	1
so?	1
Believe	1
me,"	1
and	1
Elinor	1
spoke	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
truest	1
sincerity,	1
"nothing	1
could	1
be	1
farther	1
from	1
my	1
intention	1
than	1
to	1
give	1
you	1
such	1
an	1
idea.	1
Could	1
you	1
have	1
a	1
motive	1
for	1
the	1
trust,	1
that	1
was	1
not	1
honourable	1
and	1
flattering	1
to	1
me?"	1
"And	1
yet	1
I	1
do	1
assure	1
you,"	1
replied	1
Lucy,	1
her	1
little	1
sharp	1
eyes	1
full	1
of	1
meaning,	1
"there	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
coldness	1
and	1
displeasure	1
in	1
your	1
manner	1
that	1
made	1
me	1
quite	1
uncomfortable.	1
I	1
felt	1
sure	1
that	1
you	1
was	1
angry	1
with	1
me;	1
and	1
have	1
been	1
quarrelling	1
with	1
myself	1
ever	1
since,	1
for	1
having	1
took	1
such	1
a	1
liberty	1
as	1
to	1
trouble	1
you	1
with	1
my	1
affairs.	1
But	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
find	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
my	1
own	1
fancy,	1
and	1
that	1
you	1
really	1
do	1
not	1
blame	1
me.	1
If	1
you	1
knew	1
what	1
a	1
consolation	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
relieve	1
my	1
heart	1
speaking	1
to	1
you	1
of	1
what	1
I	1
am	1
always	1
thinking	1
of	1
every	1
moment	1
of	1
my	1
life,	1
your	1
compassion	1
would	1
make	1
you	1
overlook	1
every	1
thing	1
else	1
I	1
am	1
sure."	1
"Indeed,	1
I	1
can	1
easily	1
believe	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
great	1
relief	1
to	1
you,	1
to	1
acknowledge	1
your	1
situation	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
be	1
assured	1
that	1
you	1
shall	1
never	1
have	1
reason	1
to	1
repent	1
it.	1
Your	1
case	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
unfortunate	1
one;	1
you	1
seem	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
surrounded	1
with	1
difficulties,	1
and	1
you	1
will	1
have	1
need	1
of	1
all	1
your	1
mutual	1
affection	1
to	1
support	1
you	1
under	1
them.	1
Mr.	1
Ferrars,	1
I	1
believe,	1
is	1
entirely	1
dependent	1
on	1
his	1
mother."	1
"He	1
has	1
only	1
two	1
thousand	1
pounds	1
of	1
his	1
own;	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
madness	1
to	1
marry	1
upon	1
that,	1
though	1
for	1
my	1
own	1
part,	1
I	1
could	1
give	1
up	1
every	1
prospect	1
of	1
more	1
without	1
a	1
sigh.	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
always	1
used	1
to	1
a	1
very	1
small	1
income,	1
and	1
could	1
struggle	1
with	1
any	1
poverty	1
for	1
him;	1
but	1
I	1
love	1
him	1
too	1
well	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
selfish	1
means	1
of	1
robbing	1
him,	1
perhaps,	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
his	1
mother	1
might	1
give	1
him	1
if	1
he	1
married	1
to	1
please	1
her.	1
We	1
must	1
wait,	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
for	1
many	1
years.	1
With	1
almost	1
every	1
other	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
an	1
alarming	1
prospect;	1
but	1
Edward's	1
affection	1
and	1
constancy	1
nothing	1
can	1
deprive	1
me	1
of	1
I	1
know."	1
"That	1
conviction	1
must	1
be	1
every	1
thing	1
to	1
you;	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
undoubtedly	1
supported	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
trust	1
in	1
your's.	1
If	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
your	1
reciprocal	1
attachment	1
had	1
failed,	1
as	1
between	1
many	1
people,	1
and	1
under	1
many	1
circumstances	1
it	1
naturally	1
would	1
during	1
a	1
four	1
years'	1
engagement,	1
your	1
situation	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
pitiable,	1
indeed."	1
Lucy	1
here	1
looked	1
up;	1
but	1
Elinor	1
was	1
careful	1
in	1
guarding	1
her	1
countenance	1
from	1
every	1
expression	1
that	1
could	1
give	1
her	1
words	1
a	1
suspicious	1
tendency.	1
"Edward's	1
love	1
for	1
me,"	1
said	1
Lucy,	1
"has	1
been	1
pretty	1
well	1
put	1
to	1
the	1
test,	1
by	1
our	1
long,	1
very	1
long	1
absence	1
since	1
we	1
were	1
first	1
engaged,	1
and	1
it	1
has	1
stood	1
the	1
trial	1
so	1
well,	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
unpardonable	1
to	1
doubt	1
it	1
now.	1
I	1
can	1
safely	1
say	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
never	1
gave	1
me	1
one	1
moment's	1
alarm	1
on	1
that	1
account	1
from	1
the	1
first."	1
Elinor	1
hardly	1
knew	1
whether	1
to	1
smile	1
or	1
sigh	1
at	1
this	1
assertion.	1
Lucy	1
went	1
on.	1
"I	1
am	1
rather	1
of	1
a	1
jealous	1
temper	1
too	1
by	1
nature,	1
and	1
from	1
our	1
different	1
situations	1
in	1
life,	1
from	1
his	1
being	1
so	1
much	1
more	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
than	1
me,	1
and	1
our	1
continual	1
separation,	1
I	1
was	1
enough	1
inclined	1
for	1
suspicion,	1
to	1
have	1
found	1
out	1
the	1
truth	1
in	1
an	1
instant,	1
if	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
slightest	1
alteration	1
in	1
his	1
behaviour	1
to	1
me	1
when	1
we	1
met,	1
or	1
any	1
lowness	1
of	1
spirits	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
account	1
for,	1
or	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
talked	1
more	1
of	1
one	1
lady	1
than	1
another,	1
or	1
seemed	1
in	1
any	1
respect	1
less	1
happy	1
at	1
Longstaple	1
than	1
he	1
used	1
to	1
be.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
mean	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
particularly	1
observant	1
or	1
quick-sighted	1
in	1
general,	1
but	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
case	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
deceived."	1
"All	1
this,"	1
thought	1
Elinor,	1
"is	1
very	1
pretty;	1
but	1
it	1
can	1
impose	1
upon	1
neither	1
of	1
us."	1
"But	1
what,"	1
said	1
she	1
after	1
a	1
short	1
silence,	1
"are	1
your	1
views?	1
or	1
have	1
you	1
none	1
but	1
that	1
of	1
waiting	1
for	1
Mrs.	1
Ferrars's	1
death,	1
which	1
is	1
a	1
melancholy	1
and	1
shocking	1
extremity?--Is	1
her	1
son	1
determined	1
to	1
submit	1
to	1
this,	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
tediousness	1
of	1
the	1
many	1
years	1
of	1
suspense	1
in	1
which	1
it	1
may	1
involve	1
you,	1
rather	1
than	1
run	1
the	1
risk	1
of	1
her	1
displeasure	1
for	1
a	1
while	1
by	1
owning	1
the	1
truth?"	1
"If	1
we	1
could	1
be	1
certain	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
only	1
for	1
a	1
while!	1
But	1
Mrs.	1
Ferrars	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
headstrong	1
proud	1
woman,	1
and	1
in	1
her	1
first	1
fit	1
of	1
anger	1
upon	1
hearing	1
it,	1
would	1
very	1
likely	1
secure	1
every	1
thing	1
to	1
Robert,	1
and	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
that,	1
for	1
Edward's	1
sake,	1
frightens	1
away	1
all	1
my	1
inclination	1
for	1
hasty	1
measures."	1
"And	1
for	1
your	1
own	1
sake	1
too,	1
or	1
you	1
are	1
carrying	1
your	1
disinterestedness	1
beyond	1
reason."	1
Lucy	1
looked	1
at	1
Elinor	1
again,	1
and	1
was	1
silent.	1
"Do	1
you	1
know	1
Mr.	1
Robert	1
Ferrars?"	1
asked	1
Elinor.	1
"Not	1
at	1
all--I	1
never	1
saw	1
him;	1
but	1
I	1
fancy	1
he	1
is	1
very	1
unlike	1
his	1
brother--silly	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
coxcomb."	1
"A	1
great	1
coxcomb!"	1
repeated	1
Miss	1
Steele,	1
whose	1
ear	1
had	1
caught	1
those	1
words	1
by	1
a	1
sudden	1
pause	1
in	1
Marianne's	1
music.--	1
"Oh,	1
they	1
are	1
talking	1
of	1
their	1
favourite	1
beaux,	1
I	1
dare	1
say."	1
"No	1
sister,"	1
cried	1
Lucy,	1
"you	1
are	1
mistaken	1
there,	1
our	1
favourite	1
beaux	1
are	1
NOT	1
great	1
coxcombs."	1
"I	1
can	1
answer	1
for	1
it	1
that	1
Miss	1
Dashwood's	1
is	1
not,"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings,	1
laughing	1
heartily;	1
"for	1
he	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
modestest,	1
prettiest	1
behaved	1
young	1
men	1
I	1
ever	1
saw;	1
but	1
as	1
for	1
Lucy,	1
she	1
is	1
such	1
a	1
sly	1
little	1
creature,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
finding	1
out	1
who	1
SHE	1
likes."	1
"Oh,"	1
cried	1
Miss	1
Steele,	1
looking	1
significantly	1
round	1
at	1
them,	1
"I	1
dare	1
say	1
Lucy's	1
beau	1
is	1
quite	1
as	1
modest	1
and	1
pretty	1
behaved	1
as	1
Miss	1
Dashwood's."	1
Elinor	1
blushed	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
herself.	1
Lucy	1
bit	1
her	1
lip,	1
and	1
looked	1
angrily	1
at	1
her	1
sister.	1
A	1
mutual	1
silence	1
took	1
place	1
for	1
some	1
time.	1
Lucy	1
first	1
put	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
it	1
by	1
saying	1
in	1
a	1
lower	1
tone,	1
though	1
Marianne	1
was	1
then	1
giving	1
them	1
the	1
powerful	1
protection	1
of	1
a	1
very	1
magnificent	1
concerto--	1
"I	1
will	1
honestly	1
tell	1
you	1
of	1
one	1
scheme	1
which	1
has	1
lately	1
come	1
into	1
my	1
head,	1
for	1
bringing	1
matters	1
to	1
bear;	1
indeed	1
I	1
am	1
bound	1
to	1
let	1
you	1
into	1
the	1
secret,	1
for	1
you	1
are	1
a	1
party	1
concerned.	1
I	1
dare	1
say	1
you	1
have	1
seen	1
enough	1
of	1
Edward	1
to	1
know	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
prefer	1
the	1
church	1
to	1
every	1
other	1
profession;	1
now	1
my	1
plan	1
is	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
take	1
orders	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
can,	1
and	1
then	1
through	1
your	1
interest,	1
which	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
you	1
would	1
be	1
kind	1
enough	1
to	1
use	1
out	1
of	1
friendship	1
for	1
him,	1
and	1
I	1
hope	1
out	1
of	1
some	1
regard	1
to	1
me,	1
your	1
brother	1
might	1
be	1
persuaded	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
Norland	1
living;	1
which	1
I	1
understand	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
one,	1
and	1
the	1
present	1
incumbent	1
not	1
likely	1
to	1
live	1
a	1
great	1
while.	1
That	1
would	1
be	1
enough	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
marry	1
upon,	1
and	1
we	1
might	1
trust	1
to	1
time	1
and	1
chance	1
for	1
the	1
rest."	1
"I	1
should	1
always	1
be	1
happy,"	1
replied	1
Elinor,	1
"to	1
show	1
any	1
mark	1
of	1
my	1
esteem	1
and	1
friendship	1
for	1
Mr.	1
Ferrars;	1
but	1
do	1
you	1
not	1
perceive	1
that	1
my	1
interest	1
on	1
such	1
an	1
occasion	1
would	1
be	1
perfectly	1
unnecessary?	1
He	1
is	1
brother	1
to	1
Mrs.	1
John	1
Dashwood--THAT	1
must	1
be	1
recommendation	1
enough	1
to	1
her	1
husband."	1
"But	1
Mrs.	1
John	1
Dashwood	1
would	1
not	1
much	1
approve	1
of	1
Edward's	1
going	1
into	1
orders."	1
"Then	1
I	1
rather	1
suspect	1
that	1
my	1
interest	1
would	1
do	1
very	1
little."	1
They	1
were	1
again	1
silent	1
for	1
many	1
minutes.	1
At	1
length	1
Lucy	1
exclaimed	1
with	1
a	1
deep	1
sigh,	1
"I	1
believe	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
wisest	1
way	1
to	1
put	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
the	1
business	1
at	1
once	1
by	1
dissolving	1
the	1
engagement.	1
We	1
seem	1
so	1
beset	1
with	1
difficulties	1
on	1
every	1
side,	1
that	1
though	1
it	1
would	1
make	1
us	1
miserable	1
for	1
a	1
time,	1
we	1
should	1
be	1
happier	1
perhaps	1
in	1
the	1
end.	1
But	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
give	1
me	1
your	1
advice,	1
Miss	1
Dashwood?"	1
"No,"	1
answered	1
Elinor,	1
with	1
a	1
smile,	1
which	1
concealed	1
very	1
agitated	1
feelings,	1
"on	1
such	1
a	1
subject	1
I	1
certainly	1
will	1
not.	1
You	1
know	1
very	1
well	1
that	1
my	1
opinion	1
would	1
have	1
no	1
weight	1
with	1
you,	1
unless	1
it	1
were	1
on	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
your	1
wishes."	1
"Indeed	1
you	1
wrong	1
me,"	1
replied	1
Lucy,	1
with	1
great	1
solemnity;	1
"I	1
know	1
nobody	1
of	1
whose	1
judgment	1
I	1
think	1
so	1
highly	1
as	1
I	1
do	1
of	1
yours;	1
and	1
I	1
do	1
really	1
believe,	1
that	1
if	1
you	1
was	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
me,	1
'I	1
advise	1
you	1
by	1
all	1
means	1
to	1
put	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
your	1
engagement	1
with	1
Edward	1
Ferrars,	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
more	1
for	1
the	1
happiness	1
of	1
both	1
of	1
you,'	1
I	1
should	1
resolve	1
upon	1
doing	1
it	1
immediately."	1
Elinor	1
blushed	1
for	1
the	1
insincerity	1
of	1
Edward's	1
future	1
wife,	1
and	1
replied,	1
"This	1
compliment	1
would	1
effectually	1
frighten	1
me	1
from	1
giving	1
any	1
opinion	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
had	1
I	1
formed	1
one.	1
It	1
raises	1
my	1
influence	1
much	1
too	1
high;	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
dividing	1
two	1
people	1
so	1
tenderly	1
attached	1
is	1
too	1
much	1
for	1
an	1
indifferent	1
person."	1
"'Tis	1
because	1
you	1
are	1
an	1
indifferent	1
person,"	1
said	1
Lucy,	1
with	1
some	1
pique,	1
and	1
laying	1
a	1
particular	1
stress	1
on	1
those	1
words,	1
"that	1
your	1
judgment	1
might	1
justly	1
have	1
such	1
weight	1
with	1
me.	1
If	1
you	1
could	1
be	1
supposed	1
to	1
be	1
biased	1
in	1
any	1
respect	1
by	1
your	1
own	1
feelings,	1
your	1
opinion	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
worth	1
having."	1
Elinor	1
thought	1
it	1
wisest	1
to	1
make	1
no	1
answer	1
to	1
this,	1
lest	1
they	1
might	1
provoke	1
each	1
other	1
to	1
an	1
unsuitable	1
increase	1
of	1
ease	1
and	1
unreserve;	1
and	1
was	1
even	1
partly	1
determined	1
never	1
to	1
mention	1
the	1
subject	1
again.	1
Another	1
pause	1
therefore	1
of	1
many	1
minutes'	1
duration,	1
succeeded	1
this	1
speech,	1
and	1
Lucy	1
was	1
still	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
end	1
it.	1
"Shall	1
you	1
be	1
in	1
town	1
this	1
winter,	1
Miss	1
Dashwood?"	1
said	1
she	1
with	1
all	1
her	1
accustomary	1
complacency.	1
"Certainly	1
not."	1
"I	1
am	1
sorry	1
for	1
that,"	1
returned	1
the	1
other,	1
while	1
her	1
eyes	1
brightened	1
at	1
the	1
information,	1
"it	1
would	1
have	1
gave	1
me	1
such	1
pleasure	1
to	1
meet	1
you	1
there!	1
But	1
I	1
dare	1
say	1
you	1
will	1
go	1
for	1
all	1
that.	1
To	1
be	1
sure,	1
your	1
brother	1
and	1
sister	1
will	1
ask	1
you	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
them."	1
"It	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
in	1
my	1
power	1
to	1
accept	1
their	1
invitation	1
if	1
they	1
do."	1
"How	1
unlucky	1
that	1
is!	1
I	1
had	1
quite	1
depended	1
upon	1
meeting	1
you	1
there.	1
Anne	1
and	1
me	1
are	1
to	1
go	1
the	1
latter	1
end	1
of	1
January	1
to	1
some	1
relations	1
who	1
have	1
been	1
wanting	1
us	1
to	1
visit	1
them	1
these	1
several	1
years!	1
But	1
I	1
only	1
go	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
seeing	1
Edward.	1
He	1
will	1
be	1
there	1
in	1
February,	1
otherwise	1
London	1
would	1
have	1
no	1
charms	1
for	1
me;	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
spirits	1
for	1
it."	1
Elinor	1
was	1
soon	1
called	1
to	1
the	1
card-table	1
by	1
the	1
conclusion	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
rubber,	1
and	1
the	1
confidential	1
discourse	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
ladies	1
was	1
therefore	1
at	1
an	1
end,	1
to	1
which	1
both	1
of	1
them	1
submitted	1
without	1
any	1
reluctance,	1
for	1
nothing	1
had	1
been	1
said	1
on	1
either	1
side	1
to	1
make	1
them	1
dislike	1
each	1
other	1
less	1
than	1
they	1
had	1
done	1
before;	1
and	1
Elinor	1
sat	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
card	1
table	1
with	1
the	1
melancholy	1
persuasion	1
that	1
Edward	1
was	1
not	1
only	1
without	1
affection	1
for	1
the	1
person	1
who	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
his	1
wife;	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
even	1
the	1
chance	1
of	1
being	1
tolerably	1
happy	1
in	1
marriage,	1
which	1
sincere	1
affection	1
on	1
HER	1
side	1
would	1
have	1
given,	1
for	1
self-interest	1
alone	1
could	1
induce	1
a	1
woman	1
to	1
keep	1
a	1
man	1
to	1
an	1
engagement,	1
of	1
which	1
she	1
seemed	1
so	1
thoroughly	1
aware	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
weary.	1
From	1
this	1
time	1
the	1
subject	1
was	1
never	1
revived	1
by	1
Elinor,	1
and	1
when	1
entered	1
on	1
by	1
Lucy,	1
who	1
seldom	1
missed	1
an	1
opportunity	1
of	1
introducing	1
it,	1
and	1
was	1
particularly	1
careful	1
to	1
inform	1
her	1
confidante,	1
of	1
her	1
happiness	1
whenever	1
she	1
received	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
Edward,	1
it	1
was	1
treated	1
by	1
the	1
former	1
with	1
calmness	1
and	1
caution,	1
and	1
dismissed	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
civility	1
would	1
allow;	1
for	1
she	1
felt	1
such	1
conversations	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
indulgence	1
which	1
Lucy	1
did	1
not	1
deserve,	1
and	1
which	1
were	1
dangerous	1
to	1
herself.	1
The	1
visit	1
of	1
the	1
Miss	1
Steeles	1
at	1
Barton	1
Park	1
was	1
lengthened	1
far	1
beyond	1
what	1
the	1
first	1
invitation	1
implied.	1
Their	1
favour	1
increased;	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
spared;	1
Sir	1
John	1
would	1
not	1
hear	1
of	1
their	1
going;	1
and	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
their	1
numerous	1
and	1
long	1
arranged	1
engagements	1
in	1
Exeter,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
absolute	1
necessity	1
of	1
returning	1
to	1
fulfill	1
them	1
immediately,	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
full	1
force	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
every	1
week,	1
they	1
were	1
prevailed	1
on	1
to	1
stay	1
nearly	1
two	1
months	1
at	1
the	1
park,	1
and	1
to	1
assist	1
in	1
the	1
due	1
celebration	1
of	1
that	1
festival	1
which	1
requires	1
a	1
more	1
than	1
ordinary	1
share	1
of	1
private	1
balls	1
and	1
large	1
dinners	1
to	1
proclaim	1
its	1
importance.	1
CHAPTER	1
25	1
Though	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
habit	1
of	1
spending	1
a	1
large	1
portion	1
of	1
the	1
year	1
at	1
the	1
houses	1
of	1
her	1
children	1
and	1
friends,	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
without	1
a	1
settled	1
habitation	1
of	1
her	1
own.	1
Since	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
her	1
husband,	1
who	1
had	1
traded	1
with	1
success	1
in	1
a	1
less	1
elegant	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
town,	1
she	1
had	1
resided	1
every	1
winter	1
in	1
a	1
house	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
streets	1
near	1
Portman	1
Square.	1
Towards	1
this	1
home,	1
she	1
began	1
on	1
the	1
approach	1
of	1
January	1
to	1
turn	1
her	1
thoughts,	1
and	1
thither	1
she	1
one	1
day	1
abruptly,	1
and	1
very	1
unexpectedly	1
by	1
them,	1
asked	1
the	1
elder	1
Misses	1
Dashwood	1
to	1
accompany	1
her.	1
Elinor,	1
without	1
observing	1
the	1
varying	1
complexion	1
of	1
her	1
sister,	1
and	1
the	1
animated	1
look	1
which	1
spoke	1
no	1
indifference	1
to	1
the	1
plan,	1
immediately	1
gave	1
a	1
grateful	1
but	1
absolute	1
denial	1
for	1
both,	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
believed	1
herself	1
to	1
be	1
speaking	1
their	1
united	1
inclinations.	1
The	1
reason	1
alleged	1
was	1
their	1
determined	1
resolution	1
of	1
not	1
leaving	1
their	1
mother	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
year.	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
received	1
the	1
refusal	1
with	1
some	1
surprise,	1
and	1
repeated	1
her	1
invitation	1
immediately.	1
"Oh,	1
Lord!	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
your	1
mother	1
can	1
spare	1
you	1
very	1
well,	1
and	1
I	1
DO	1
beg	1
you	1
will	1
favour	1
me	1
with	1
your	1
company,	1
for	1
I've	1
quite	1
set	1
my	1
heart	1
upon	1
it.	1
Don't	1
fancy	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
any	1
inconvenience	1
to	1
me,	1
for	1
I	1
shan't	1
put	1
myself	1
at	1
all	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
way	1
for	1
you.	1
It	1
will	1
only	1
be	1
sending	1
Betty	1
by	1
the	1
coach,	1
and	1
I	1
hope	1
I	1
can	1
afford	1
THAT.	1
We	1
three	1
shall	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
go	1
very	1
well	1
in	1
my	1
chaise;	1
and	1
when	1
we	1
are	1
in	1
town,	1
if	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
like	1
to	1
go	1
wherever	1
I	1
do,	1
well	1
and	1
good,	1
you	1
may	1
always	1
go	1
with	1
one	1
of	1
my	1
daughters.	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
your	1
mother	1
will	1
not	1
object	1
to	1
it;	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
such	1
good	1
luck	1
in	1
getting	1
my	1
own	1
children	1
off	1
my	1
hands	1
that	1
she	1
will	1
think	1
me	1
a	1
very	1
fit	1
person	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
charge	1
of	1
you;	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
don't	1
get	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
at	1
least	1
well	1
married	1
before	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
with	1
you,	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
my	1
fault.	1
I	1
shall	1
speak	1
a	1
good	1
word	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
young	1
men,	1
you	1
may	1
depend	1
upon	1
it."	1
"I	1
have	1
a	1
notion,"	1
said	1
Sir	1
John,	1
"that	1
Miss	1
Marianne	1
would	1
not	1
object	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
scheme,	1
if	1
her	1
elder	1
sister	1
would	1
come	1
into	1
it.	1
It	1
is	1
very	1
hard	1
indeed	1
that	1
she	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
a	1
little	1
pleasure,	1
because	1
Miss	1
Dashwood	1
does	1
not	1
wish	1
it.	1
So	1
I	1
would	1
advise	1
you	1
two,	1
to	1
set	1
off	1
for	1
town,	1
when	1
you	1
are	1
tired	1
of	1
Barton,	1
without	1
saying	1
a	1
word	1
to	1
Miss	1
Dashwood	1
about	1
it."	1
"Nay,"	1
cried	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings,	1
"I	1
am	1
sure	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
monstrous	1
glad	1
of	1
Miss	1
Marianne's	1
company,	1
whether	1
Miss	1
Dashwood	1
will	1
go	1
or	1
not,	1
only	1
the	1
more	1
the	1
merrier	1
say	1
I,	1
and	1
I	1
thought	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
more	1
comfortable	1
for	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
together;	1
because,	1
if	1
they	1
got	1
tired	1
of	1
me,	1
they	1
might	1
talk	1
to	1
one	1
another,	1
and	1
laugh	1
at	1
my	1
old	1
ways	1
behind	1
my	1
back.	1
But	1
one	1
or	1
the	1
other,	1
if	1
not	1
both	1
of	1
them,	1
I	1
must	1
have.	1
Lord	1
bless	1
me!	1
how	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
I	1
can	1
live	1
poking	1
by	1
myself,	1
I	1
who	1
have	1
been	1
always	1
used	1
till	1
this	1
winter	1
to	1
have	1
Charlotte	1
with	1
me.	1
Come,	1
Miss	1
Marianne,	1
let	1
us	1
strike	1
hands	1
upon	1
the	1
bargain,	1
and	1
if	1
Miss	1
Dashwood	1
will	1
change	1
her	1
mind	1
by	1
and	1
bye,	1
why	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
better."	1
"I	1
thank	1
you,	1
ma'am,	1
sincerely	1
thank	1
you,"	1
said	1
Marianne,	1
with	1
warmth:	1
"your	1
invitation	1
has	1
insured	1
my	1
gratitude	1
for	1
ever,	1
and	1
it	1
would	1
give	1
me	1
such	1
happiness,	1
yes,	1
almost	1
the	1
greatest	1
happiness	1
I	1
am	1
capable	1
of,	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
accept	1
it.	1
But	1
my	1
mother,	1
my	1
dearest,	1
kindest	1
mother,--I	1
feel	1
the	1
justice	1
of	1
what	1
Elinor	1
has	1
urged,	1
and	1
if	1
she	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
made	1
less	1
happy,	1
less	1
comfortable	1
by	1
our	1
absence--Oh!	1
no,	1
nothing	1
should	1
tempt	1
me	1
to	1
leave	1
her.	1
It	1
should	1
not,	1
must	1
not	1
be	1
a	1
struggle."	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
repeated	1
her	1
assurance	1
that	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood	1
could	1
spare	1
them	1
perfectly	1
well;	1
and	1
Elinor,	1
who	1
now	1
understood	1
her	1
sister,	1
and	1
saw	1
to	1
what	1
indifference	1
to	1
almost	1
every	1
thing	1
else	1
she	1
was	1
carried	1
by	1
her	1
eagerness	1
to	1
be	1
with	1
Willoughby	1
again,	1
made	1
no	1
farther	1
direct	1
opposition	1
to	1
the	1
plan,	1
and	1
merely	1
referred	1
it	1
to	1
her	1
mother's	1
decision,	1
from	1
whom	1
however	1
she	1
scarcely	1
expected	1
to	1
receive	1
any	1
support	1
in	1
her	1
endeavour	1
to	1
prevent	1
a	1
visit,	1
which	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
approve	1
of	1
for	1
Marianne,	1
and	1
which	1
on	1
her	1
own	1
account	1
she	1
had	1
particular	1
reasons	1
to	1
avoid.	1
Whatever	1
Marianne	1
was	1
desirous	1
of,	1
her	1
mother	1
would	1
be	1
eager	1
to	1
promote--she	1
could	1
not	1
expect	1
to	1
influence	1
the	1
latter	1
to	1
cautiousness	1
of	1
conduct	1
in	1
an	1
affair	1
respecting	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
inspire	1
her	1
with	1
distrust;	1
and	1
she	1
dared	1
not	1
explain	1
the	1
motive	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
disinclination	1
for	1
going	1
to	1
London.	1
That	1
Marianne,	1
fastidious	1
as	1
she	1
was,	1
thoroughly	1
acquainted	1
with	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings'	1
manners,	1
and	1
invariably	1
disgusted	1
by	1
them,	1
should	1
overlook	1
every	1
inconvenience	1
of	1
that	1
kind,	1
should	1
disregard	1
whatever	1
must	1
be	1
most	1
wounding	1
to	1
her	1
irritable	1
feelings,	1
in	1
her	1
pursuit	1
of	1
one	1
object,	1
was	1
such	1
a	1
proof,	1
so	1
strong,	1
so	1
full,	1
of	1
the	1
importance	1
of	1
that	1
object	1
to	1
her,	1
as	1
Elinor,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
passed,	1
was	1
not	1
prepared	1
to	1
witness.	1
On	1
being	1
informed	1
of	1
the	1
invitation,	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood,	1
persuaded	1
that	1
such	1
an	1
excursion	1
would	1
be	1
productive	1
of	1
much	1
amusement	1
to	1
both	1
her	1
daughters,	1
and	1
perceiving	1
through	1
all	1
her	1
affectionate	1
attention	1
to	1
herself,	1
how	1
much	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
Marianne	1
was	1
in	1
it,	1
would	1
not	1
hear	1
of	1
their	1
declining	1
the	1
offer	1
upon	1
HER	1
account;	1
insisted	1
on	1
their	1
both	1
accepting	1
it	1
directly;	1
and	1
then	1
began	1
to	1
foresee,	1
with	1
her	1
usual	1
cheerfulness,	1
a	1
variety	1
of	1
advantages	1
that	1
would	1
accrue	1
to	1
them	1
all,	1
from	1
this	1
separation.	1
"I	1
am	1
delighted	1
with	1
the	1
plan,"	1
she	1
cried,	1
"it	1
is	1
exactly	1
what	1
I	1
could	1
wish.	1
Margaret	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
much	1
benefited	1
by	1
it	1
as	1
yourselves.	1
When	1
you	1
and	1
the	1
Middletons	1
are	1
gone,	1
we	1
shall	1
go	1
on	1
so	1
quietly	1
and	1
happily	1
together	1
with	1
our	1
books	1
and	1
our	1
music!	1
You	1
will	1
find	1
Margaret	1
so	1
improved	1
when	1
you	1
come	1
back	1
again!	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
little	1
plan	1
of	1
alteration	1
for	1
your	1
bedrooms	1
too,	1
which	1
may	1
now	1
be	1
performed	1
without	1
any	1
inconvenience	1
to	1
any	1
one.	1
It	1
is	1
very	1
right	1
that	1
you	1
SHOULD	1
go	1
to	1
town;	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
every	1
young	1
woman	1
of	1
your	1
condition	1
in	1
life	1
acquainted	1
with	1
the	1
manners	1
and	1
amusements	1
of	1
London.	1
You	1
will	1
be	1
under	1
the	1
care	1
of	1
a	1
motherly	1
good	1
sort	1
of	1
woman,	1
of	1
whose	1
kindness	1
to	1
you	1
I	1
can	1
have	1
no	1
doubt.	1
And	1
in	1
all	1
probability	1
you	1
will	1
see	1
your	1
brother,	1
and	1
whatever	1
may	1
be	1
his	1
faults,	1
or	1
the	1
faults	1
of	1
his	1
wife,	1
when	1
I	1
consider	1
whose	1
son	1
he	1
is,	1
I	1
cannot	1
bear	1
to	1
have	1
you	1
so	1
wholly	1
estranged	1
from	1
each	1
other."	1
"Though	1
with	1
your	1
usual	1
anxiety	1
for	1
our	1
happiness,"	1
said	1
Elinor,	1
"you	1
have	1
been	1
obviating	1
every	1
impediment	1
to	1
the	1
present	1
scheme	1
which	1
occurred	1
to	1
you,	1
there	1
is	1
still	1
one	1
objection	1
which,	1
in	1
my	1
opinion,	1
cannot	1
be	1
so	1
easily	1
removed."	1
Marianne's	1
countenance	1
sunk.	1
"And	1
what,"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood,	1
"is	1
my	1
dear	1
prudent	1
Elinor	1
going	1
to	1
suggest?	1
What	1
formidable	1
obstacle	1
is	1
she	1
now	1
to	1
bring	1
forward?	1
Do	1
let	1
me	1
hear	1
a	1
word	1
about	1
the	1
expense	1
of	1
it."	1
"My	1
objection	1
is	1
this;	1
though	1
I	1
think	1
very	1
well	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings's	1
heart,	1
she	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
woman	1
whose	1
society	1
can	1
afford	1
us	1
pleasure,	1
or	1
whose	1
protection	1
will	1
give	1
us	1
consequence."	1
"That	1
is	1
very	1
true,"	1
replied	1
her	1
mother,	1
"but	1
of	1
her	1
society,	1
separately	1
from	1
that	1
of	1
other	1
people,	1
you	1
will	1
scarcely	1
have	1
any	1
thing	1
at	1
all,	1
and	1
you	1
will	1
almost	1
always	1
appear	1
in	1
public	1
with	1
Lady	1
Middleton."	1
"If	1
Elinor	1
is	1
frightened	1
away	1
by	1
her	1
dislike	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings,"	1
said	1
Marianne,	1
"at	1
least	1
it	1
need	1
not	1
prevent	1
MY	1
accepting	1
her	1
invitation.	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
such	1
scruples,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
I	1
could	1
put	1
up	1
with	1
every	1
unpleasantness	1
of	1
that	1
kind	1
with	1
very	1
little	1
effort."	1
Elinor	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
smiling	1
at	1
this	1
display	1
of	1
indifference	1
towards	1
the	1
manners	1
of	1
a	1
person,	1
to	1
whom	1
she	1
had	1
often	1
had	1
difficulty	1
in	1
persuading	1
Marianne	1
to	1
behave	1
with	1
tolerable	1
politeness;	1
and	1
resolved	1
within	1
herself,	1
that	1
if	1
her	1
sister	1
persisted	1
in	1
going,	1
she	1
would	1
go	1
likewise,	1
as	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
it	1
proper	1
that	1
Marianne	1
should	1
be	1
left	1
to	1
the	1
sole	1
guidance	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
judgment,	1
or	1
that	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
should	1
be	1
abandoned	1
to	1
the	1
mercy	1
of	1
Marianne	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
comfort	1
of	1
her	1
domestic	1
hours.	1
To	1
this	1
determination	1
she	1
was	1
the	1
more	1
easily	1
reconciled,	1
by	1
recollecting	1
that	1
Edward	1
Ferrars,	1
by	1
Lucy's	1
account,	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
town	1
before	1
February;	1
and	1
that	1
their	1
visit,	1
without	1
any	1
unreasonable	1
abridgement,	1
might	1
be	1
previously	1
finished.	1
"I	1
will	1
have	1
you	1
BOTH	1
go,"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood;	1
"these	1
objections	1
are	1
nonsensical.	1
You	1
will	1
have	1
much	1
pleasure	1
in	1
being	1
in	1
London,	1
and	1
especially	1
in	1
being	1
together;	1
and	1
if	1
Elinor	1
would	1
ever	1
condescend	1
to	1
anticipate	1
enjoyment,	1
she	1
would	1
foresee	1
it	1
there	1
from	1
a	1
variety	1
of	1
sources;	1
she	1
would,	1
perhaps,	1
expect	1
some	1
from	1
improving	1
her	1
acquaintance	1
with	1
her	1
sister-in-law's	1
family."	1
Elinor	1
had	1
often	1
wished	1
for	1
an	1
opportunity	1
of	1
attempting	1
to	1
weaken	1
her	1
mother's	1
dependence	1
on	1
the	1
attachment	1
of	1
Edward	1
and	1
herself,	1
that	1
the	1
shock	1
might	1
be	1
less	1
when	1
the	1
whole	1
truth	1
were	1
revealed,	1
and	1
now	1
on	1
this	1
attack,	1
though	1
almost	1
hopeless	1
of	1
success,	1
she	1
forced	1
herself	1
to	1
begin	1
her	1
design	1
by	1
saying,	1
as	1
calmly	1
as	1
she	1
could,	1
"I	1
like	1
Edward	1
Ferrars	1
very	1
much,	1
and	1
shall	1
always	1
be	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
him;	1
but	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
family,	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
perfect	1
indifference	1
to	1
me,	1
whether	1
I	1
am	1
ever	1
known	1
to	1
them	1
or	1
not."	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood	1
smiled,	1
and	1
said	1
nothing.	1
Marianne	1
lifted	1
up	1
her	1
eyes	1
in	1
astonishment,	1
and	1
Elinor	1
conjectured	1
that	1
she	1
might	1
as	1
well	1
have	1
held	1
her	1
tongue.	1
After	1
very	1
little	1
farther	1
discourse,	1
it	1
was	1
finally	1
settled	1
that	1
the	1
invitation	1
should	1
be	1
fully	1
accepted.	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
received	1
the	1
information	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
joy,	1
and	1
many	1
assurances	1
of	1
kindness	1
and	1
care;	1
nor	1
was	1
it	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
pleasure	1
merely	1
to	1
her.	1
Sir	1
John	1
was	1
delighted;	1
for	1
to	1
a	1
man,	1
whose	1
prevailing	1
anxiety	1
was	1
the	1
dread	1
of	1
being	1
alone,	1
the	1
acquisition	1
of	1
two,	1
to	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
inhabitants	1
in	1
London,	1
was	1
something.	1
Even	1
Lady	1
Middleton	1
took	1
the	1
trouble	1
of	1
being	1
delighted,	1
which	1
was	1
putting	1
herself	1
rather	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
way;	1
and	1
as	1
for	1
the	1
Miss	1
Steeles,	1
especially	1
Lucy,	1
they	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
so	1
happy	1
in	1
their	1
lives	1
as	1
this	1
intelligence	1
made	1
them.	1
Elinor	1
submitted	1
to	1
the	1
arrangement	1
which	1
counteracted	1
her	1
wishes	1
with	1
less	1
reluctance	1
than	1
she	1
had	1
expected	1
to	1
feel.	1
With	1
regard	1
to	1
herself,	1
it	1
was	1
now	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
unconcern	1
whether	1
she	1
went	1
to	1
town	1
or	1
not,	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
her	1
mother	1
so	1
thoroughly	1
pleased	1
with	1
the	1
plan,	1
and	1
her	1
sister	1
exhilarated	1
by	1
it	1
in	1
look,	1
voice,	1
and	1
manner,	1
restored	1
to	1
all	1
her	1
usual	1
animation,	1
and	1
elevated	1
to	1
more	1
than	1
her	1
usual	1
gaiety,	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
dissatisfied	1
with	1
the	1
cause,	1
and	1
would	1
hardly	1
allow	1
herself	1
to	1
distrust	1
the	1
consequence.	1
Marianne's	1
joy	1
was	1
almost	1
a	1
degree	1
beyond	1
happiness,	1
so	1
great	1
was	1
the	1
perturbation	1
of	1
her	1
spirits	1
and	1
her	1
impatience	1
to	1
be	1
gone.	1
Her	1
unwillingness	1
to	1
quit	1
her	1
mother	1
was	1
her	1
only	1
restorative	1
to	1
calmness;	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
of	1
parting	1
her	1
grief	1
on	1
that	1
score	1
was	1
excessive.	1
Her	1
mother's	1
affliction	1
was	1
hardly	1
less,	1
and	1
Elinor	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
three,	1
who	1
seemed	1
to	1
consider	1
the	1
separation	1
as	1
any	1
thing	1
short	1
of	1
eternal.	1
Their	1
departure	1
took	1
place	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
week	1
in	1
January.	1
The	1
Middletons	1
were	1
to	1
follow	1
in	1
about	1
a	1
week.	1
The	1
Miss	1
Steeles	1
kept	1
their	1
station	1
at	1
the	1
park,	1
and	1
were	1
to	1
quit	1
it	1
only	1
with	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
family.	1
CHAPTER	1
26	1
Elinor	1
could	1
not	1
find	1
herself	1
in	1
the	1
carriage	1
with	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings,	1
and	1
beginning	1
a	1
journey	1
to	1
London	1
under	1
her	1
protection,	1
and	1
as	1
her	1
guest,	1
without	1
wondering	1
at	1
her	1
own	1
situation,	1
so	1
short	1
had	1
their	1
acquaintance	1
with	1
that	1
lady	1
been,	1
so	1
wholly	1
unsuited	1
were	1
they	1
in	1
age	1
and	1
disposition,	1
and	1
so	1
many	1
had	1
been	1
her	1
objections	1
against	1
such	1
a	1
measure	1
only	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
before!	1
But	1
these	1
objections	1
had	1
all,	1
with	1
that	1
happy	1
ardour	1
of	1
youth	1
which	1
Marianne	1
and	1
her	1
mother	1
equally	1
shared,	1
been	1
overcome	1
or	1
overlooked;	1
and	1
Elinor,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
every	1
occasional	1
doubt	1
of	1
Willoughby's	1
constancy,	1
could	1
not	1
witness	1
the	1
rapture	1
of	1
delightful	1
expectation	1
which	1
filled	1
the	1
whole	1
soul	1
and	1
beamed	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
Marianne,	1
without	1
feeling	1
how	1
blank	1
was	1
her	1
own	1
prospect,	1
how	1
cheerless	1
her	1
own	1
state	1
of	1
mind	1
in	1
the	1
comparison,	1
and	1
how	1
gladly	1
she	1
would	1
engage	1
in	1
the	1
solicitude	1
of	1
Marianne's	1
situation	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
same	1
animating	1
object	1
in	1
view,	1
the	1
same	1
possibility	1
of	1
hope.	1
A	1
short,	1
a	1
very	1
short	1
time	1
however	1
must	1
now	1
decide	1
what	1
Willoughby's	1
intentions	1
were;	1
in	1
all	1
probability	1
he	1
was	1
already	1
in	1
town.	1
Marianne's	1
eagerness	1
to	1
be	1
gone	1
declared	1
her	1
dependence	1
on	1
finding	1
him	1
there;	1
and	1
Elinor	1
was	1
resolved	1
not	1
only	1
upon	1
gaining	1
every	1
new	1
light	1
as	1
to	1
his	1
character	1
which	1
her	1
own	1
observation	1
or	1
the	1
intelligence	1
of	1
others	1
could	1
give	1
her,	1
but	1
likewise	1
upon	1
watching	1
his	1
behaviour	1
to	1
her	1
sister	1
with	1
such	1
zealous	1
attention,	1
as	1
to	1
ascertain	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
and	1
what	1
he	1
meant,	1
before	1
many	1
meetings	1
had	1
taken	1
place.	1
Should	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
her	1
observations	1
be	1
unfavourable,	1
she	1
was	1
determined	1
at	1
all	1
events	1
to	1
open	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
her	1
sister;	1
should	1
it	1
be	1
otherwise,	1
her	1
exertions	1
would	1
be	1
of	1
a	1
different	1
nature--she	1
must	1
then	1
learn	1
to	1
avoid	1
every	1
selfish	1
comparison,	1
and	1
banish	1
every	1
regret	1
which	1
might	1
lessen	1
her	1
satisfaction	1
in	1
the	1
happiness	1
of	1
Marianne.	1
They	1
were	1
three	1
days	1
on	1
their	1
journey,	1
and	1
Marianne's	1
behaviour	1
as	1
they	1
travelled	1
was	1
a	1
happy	1
specimen	1
of	1
what	1
future	1
complaisance	1
and	1
companionableness	1
to	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
might	1
be	1
expected	1
to	1
be.	1
She	1
sat	1
in	1
silence	1
almost	1
all	1
the	1
way,	1
wrapt	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
meditations,	1
and	1
scarcely	1
ever	1
voluntarily	1
speaking,	1
except	1
when	1
any	1
object	1
of	1
picturesque	1
beauty	1
within	1
their	1
view	1
drew	1
from	1
her	1
an	1
exclamation	1
of	1
delight	1
exclusively	1
addressed	1
to	1
her	1
sister.	1
To	1
atone	1
for	1
this	1
conduct	1
therefore,	1
Elinor	1
took	1
immediate	1
possession	1
of	1
the	1
post	1
of	1
civility	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
assigned	1
herself,	1
behaved	1
with	1
the	1
greatest	1
attention	1
to	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings,	1
talked	1
with	1
her,	1
laughed	1
with	1
her,	1
and	1
listened	1
to	1
her	1
whenever	1
she	1
could;	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
on	1
her	1
side	1
treated	1
them	1
both	1
with	1
all	1
possible	1
kindness,	1
was	1
solicitous	1
on	1
every	1
occasion	1
for	1
their	1
ease	1
and	1
enjoyment,	1
and	1
only	1
disturbed	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
make	1
them	1
choose	1
their	1
own	1
dinners	1
at	1
the	1
inn,	1
nor	1
extort	1
a	1
confession	1
of	1
their	1
preferring	1
salmon	1
to	1
cod,	1
or	1
boiled	1
fowls	1
to	1
veal	1
cutlets.	1
They	1
reached	1
town	1
by	1
three	1
o'clock	1
the	1
third	1
day,	1
glad	1
to	1
be	1
released,	1
after	1
such	1
a	1
journey,	1
from	1
the	1
confinement	1
of	1
a	1
carriage,	1
and	1
ready	1
to	1
enjoy	1
all	1
the	1
luxury	1
of	1
a	1
good	1
fire.	1
The	1
house	1
was	1
handsome,	1
and	1
handsomely	1
fitted	1
up,	1
and	1
the	1
young	1
ladies	1
were	1
immediately	1
put	1
in	1
possession	1
of	1
a	1
very	1
comfortable	1
apartment.	1
It	1
had	1
formerly	1
been	1
Charlotte's,	1
and	1
over	1
the	1
mantelpiece	1
still	1
hung	1
a	1
landscape	1
in	1
coloured	1
silks	1
of	1
her	1
performance,	1
in	1
proof	1
of	1
her	1
having	1
spent	1
seven	1
years	1
at	1
a	1
great	1
school	1
in	1
town	1
to	1
some	1
effect.	1
As	1
dinner	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
ready	1
in	1
less	1
than	1
two	1
hours	1
from	1
their	1
arrival,	1
Elinor	1
determined	1
to	1
employ	1
the	1
interval	1
in	1
writing	1
to	1
her	1
mother,	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
for	1
that	1
purpose.	1
In	1
a	1
few	1
moments	1
Marianne	1
did	1
the	1
same.	1
"I	1
am	1
writing	1
home,	1
Marianne,"	1
said	1
Elinor;	1
"had	1
not	1
you	1
better	1
defer	1
your	1
letter	1
for	1
a	1
day	1
or	1
two?"	1
"I	1
am	1
NOT	1
going	1
to	1
write	1
to	1
my	1
mother,"	1
replied	1
Marianne,	1
hastily,	1
and	1
as	1
if	1
wishing	1
to	1
avoid	1
any	1
farther	1
inquiry.	1
Elinor	1
said	1
no	1
more;	1
it	1
immediately	1
struck	1
her	1
that	1
she	1
must	1
then	1
be	1
writing	1
to	1
Willoughby;	1
and	1
the	1
conclusion	1
which	1
as	1
instantly	1
followed	1
was,	1
that,	1
however	1
mysteriously	1
they	1
might	1
wish	1
to	1
conduct	1
the	1
affair,	1
they	1
must	1
be	1
engaged.	1
This	1
conviction,	1
though	1
not	1
entirely	1
satisfactory,	1
gave	1
her	1
pleasure,	1
and	1
she	1
continued	1
her	1
letter	1
with	1
greater	1
alacrity.	1
Marianne's	1
was	1
finished	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
few	1
minutes;	1
in	1
length	1
it	1
could	1
be	1
no	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
note;	1
it	1
was	1
then	1
folded	1
up,	1
sealed,	1
and	1
directed	1
with	1
eager	1
rapidity.	1
Elinor	1
thought	1
she	1
could	1
distinguish	1
a	1
large	1
W	1
in	1
the	1
direction;	1
and	1
no	1
sooner	1
was	1
it	1
complete	1
than	1
Marianne,	1
ringing	1
the	1
bell,	1
requested	1
the	1
footman	1
who	1
answered	1
it	1
to	1
get	1
that	1
letter	1
conveyed	1
for	1
her	1
to	1
the	1
two-penny	1
post.	1
This	1
decided	1
the	1
matter	1
at	1
once.	1
Her	1
spirits	1
still	1
continued	1
very	1
high;	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
flutter	1
in	1
them	1
which	1
prevented	1
their	1
giving	1
much	1
pleasure	1
to	1
her	1
sister,	1
and	1
this	1
agitation	1
increased	1
as	1
the	1
evening	1
drew	1
on.	1
She	1
could	1
scarcely	1
eat	1
any	1
dinner,	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
afterwards	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
drawing	1
room,	1
seemed	1
anxiously	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
every	1
carriage.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
satisfaction	1
to	1
Elinor	1
that	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings,	1
by	1
being	1
much	1
engaged	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
room,	1
could	1
see	1
little	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
passing.	1
The	1
tea	1
things	1
were	1
brought	1
in,	1
and	1
already	1
had	1
Marianne	1
been	1
disappointed	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
by	1
a	1
rap	1
at	1
a	1
neighbouring	1
door,	1
when	1
a	1
loud	1
one	1
was	1
suddenly	1
heard	1
which	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
mistaken	1
for	1
one	1
at	1
any	1
other	1
house,	1
Elinor	1
felt	1
secure	1
of	1
its	1
announcing	1
Willoughby's	1
approach,	1
and	1
Marianne,	1
starting	1
up,	1
moved	1
towards	1
the	1
door.	1
Every	1
thing	1
was	1
silent;	1
this	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
borne	1
many	1
seconds;	1
she	1
opened	1
the	1
door,	1
advanced	1
a	1
few	1
steps	1
towards	1
the	1
stairs,	1
and	1
after	1
listening	1
half	1
a	1
minute,	1
returned	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
agitation	1
which	1
a	1
conviction	1
of	1
having	1
heard	1
him	1
would	1
naturally	1
produce;	1
in	1
the	1
ecstasy	1
of	1
her	1
feelings	1
at	1
that	1
instant	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
exclaiming,	1
"Oh,	1
Elinor,	1
it	1
is	1
Willoughby,	1
indeed	1
it	1
is!"	1
and	1
seemed	1
almost	1
ready	1
to	1
throw	1
herself	1
into	1
his	1
arms,	1
when	1
Colonel	1
Brandon	1
appeared.	1
It	1
was	1
too	1
great	1
a	1
shock	1
to	1
be	1
borne	1
with	1
calmness,	1
and	1
she	1
immediately	1
left	1
the	1
room.	1
Elinor	1
was	1
disappointed	1
too;	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
her	1
regard	1
for	1
Colonel	1
Brandon	1
ensured	1
his	1
welcome	1
with	1
her;	1
and	1
she	1
felt	1
particularly	1
hurt	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
so	1
partial	1
to	1
her	1
sister	1
should	1
perceive	1
that	1
she	1
experienced	1
nothing	1
but	1
grief	1
and	1
disappointment	1
in	1
seeing	1
him.	1
She	1
instantly	1
saw	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
unnoticed	1
by	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
even	1
observed	1
Marianne	1
as	1
she	1
quitted	1
the	1
room,	1
with	1
such	1
astonishment	1
and	1
concern,	1
as	1
hardly	1
left	1
him	1
the	1
recollection	1
of	1
what	1
civility	1
demanded	1
towards	1
herself.	1
"Is	1
your	1
sister	1
ill?"	1
said	1
he.	1
Elinor	1
answered	1
in	1
some	1
distress	1
that	1
she	1
was,	1
and	1
then	1
talked	1
of	1
head-aches,	1
low	1
spirits,	1
and	1
over	1
fatigues;	1
and	1
of	1
every	1
thing	1
to	1
which	1
she	1
could	1
decently	1
attribute	1
her	1
sister's	1
behaviour.	1
He	1
heard	1
her	1
with	1
the	1
most	1
earnest	1
attention,	1
but	1
seeming	1
to	1
recollect	1
himself,	1
said	1
no	1
more	1
on	1
the	1
subject,	1
and	1
began	1
directly	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
his	1
pleasure	1
at	1
seeing	1
them	1
in	1
London,	1
making	1
the	1
usual	1
inquiries	1
about	1
their	1
journey,	1
and	1
the	1
friends	1
they	1
had	1
left	1
behind.	1
In	1
this	1
calm	1
kind	1
of	1
way,	1
with	1
very	1
little	1
interest	1
on	1
either	1
side,	1
they	1
continued	1
to	1
talk,	1
both	1
of	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
spirits,	1
and	1
the	1
thoughts	1
of	1
both	1
engaged	1
elsewhere.	1
Elinor	1
wished	1
very	1
much	1
to	1
ask	1
whether	1
Willoughby	1
were	1
then	1
in	1
town,	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
giving	1
him	1
pain	1
by	1
any	1
enquiry	1
after	1
his	1
rival;	1
and	1
at	1
length,	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
saying	1
something,	1
she	1
asked	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
London	1
ever	1
since	1
she	1
had	1
seen	1
him	1
last.	1
"Yes,"	1
he	1
replied,	1
with	1
some	1
embarrassment,	1
"almost	1
ever	1
since;	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
once	1
or	1
twice	1
at	1
Delaford	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
days,	1
but	1
it	1
has	1
never	1
been	1
in	1
my	1
power	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
Barton."	1
This,	1
and	1
the	1
manner	1
in	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
said,	1
immediately	1
brought	1
back	1
to	1
her	1
remembrance	1
all	1
the	1
circumstances	1
of	1
his	1
quitting	1
that	1
place,	1
with	1
the	1
uneasiness	1
and	1
suspicions	1
they	1
had	1
caused	1
to	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings,	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
fearful	1
that	1
her	1
question	1
had	1
implied	1
much	1
more	1
curiosity	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
than	1
she	1
had	1
ever	1
felt.	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
soon	1
came	1
in.	1
"Oh!	1
Colonel,"	1
said	1
she,	1
with	1
her	1
usual	1
noisy	1
cheerfulness,	1
"I	1
am	1
monstrous	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
you--sorry	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
come	1
before--beg	1
your	1
pardon,	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
forced	1
to	1
look	1
about	1
me	1
a	1
little,	1
and	1
settle	1
my	1
matters;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
since	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
at	1
home,	1
and	1
you	1
know	1
one	1
has	1
always	1
a	1
world	1
of	1
little	1
odd	1
things	1
to	1
do	1
after	1
one	1
has	1
been	1
away	1
for	1
any	1
time;	1
and	1
then	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
Cartwright	1
to	1
settle	1
with--	1
Lord,	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
as	1
busy	1
as	1
a	1
bee	1
ever	1
since	1
dinner!	1
But	1
pray,	1
Colonel,	1
how	1
came	1
you	1
to	1
conjure	1
out	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
in	1
town	1
today?"	1
"I	1
had	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
hearing	1
it	1
at	1
Mr.	1
Palmer's,	1
where	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
dining."	1
"Oh,	1
you	1
did;	1
well,	1
and	1
how	1
do	1
they	1
all	1
do	1
at	1
their	1
house?	1
How	1
does	1
Charlotte	1
do?	1
I	1
warrant	1
you	1
she	1
is	1
a	1
fine	1
size	1
by	1
this	1
time."	1
"Mrs.	1
Palmer	1
appeared	1
quite	1
well,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
commissioned	1
to	1
tell	1
you,	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
certainly	1
see	1
her	1
to-morrow."	1
"Ay,	1
to	1
be	1
sure,	1
I	1
thought	1
as	1
much.	1
Well,	1
Colonel,	1
I	1
have	1
brought	1
two	1
young	1
ladies	1
with	1
me,	1
you	1
see--that	1
is,	1
you	1
see	1
but	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
now,	1
but	1
there	1
is	1
another	1
somewhere.	1
Your	1
friend,	1
Miss	1
Marianne,	1
too--which	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
sorry	1
to	1
hear.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
you	1
and	1
Mr.	1
Willoughby	1
will	1
do	1
between	1
you	1
about	1
her.	1
Ay,	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
fine	1
thing	1
to	1
be	1
young	1
and	1
handsome.	1
Well!	1
I	1
was	1
young	1
once,	1
but	1
I	1
never	1
was	1
very	1
handsome--worse	1
luck	1
for	1
me.	1
However,	1
I	1
got	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
husband,	1
and	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
what	1
the	1
greatest	1
beauty	1
can	1
do	1
more.	1
Ah!	1
poor	1
man!	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
dead	1
these	1
eight	1
years	1
and	1
better.	1
But	1
Colonel,	1
where	1
have	1
you	1
been	1
to	1
since	1
we	1
parted?	1
And	1
how	1
does	1
your	1
business	1
go	1
on?	1
Come,	1
come,	1
let's	1
have	1
no	1
secrets	1
among	1
friends."	1
He	1
replied	1
with	1
his	1
accustomary	1
mildness	1
to	1
all	1
her	1
inquiries,	1
but	1
without	1
satisfying	1
her	1
in	1
any.	1
Elinor	1
now	1
began	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
tea,	1
and	1
Marianne	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
appear	1
again.	1
After	1
her	1
entrance,	1
Colonel	1
Brandon	1
became	1
more	1
thoughtful	1
and	1
silent	1
than	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
before,	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
could	1
not	1
prevail	1
on	1
him	1
to	1
stay	1
long.	1
No	1
other	1
visitor	1
appeared	1
that	1
evening,	1
and	1
the	1
ladies	1
were	1
unanimous	1
in	1
agreeing	1
to	1
go	1
early	1
to	1
bed.	1
Marianne	1
rose	1
the	1
next	1
morning	1
with	1
recovered	1
spirits	1
and	1
happy	1
looks.	1
The	1
disappointment	1
of	1
the	1
evening	1
before	1
seemed	1
forgotten	1
in	1
the	1
expectation	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
to	1
happen	1
that	1
day.	1
They	1
had	1
not	1
long	1
finished	1
their	1
breakfast	1
before	1
Mrs.	1
Palmer's	1
barouche	1
stopped	1
at	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
she	1
came	1
laughing	1
into	1
the	1
room:	1
so	1
delighted	1
to	1
see	1
them	1
all,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
hard	1
to	1
say	1
whether	1
she	1
received	1
most	1
pleasure	1
from	1
meeting	1
her	1
mother	1
or	1
the	1
Miss	1
Dashwoods	1
again.	1
So	1
surprised	1
at	1
their	1
coming	1
to	1
town,	1
though	1
it	1
was	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
rather	1
expected	1
all	1
along;	1
so	1
angry	1
at	1
their	1
accepting	1
her	1
mother's	1
invitation	1
after	1
having	1
declined	1
her	1
own,	1
though	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
she	1
would	1
never	1
have	1
forgiven	1
them	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
come!	1
"Mr.	1
Palmer	1
will	1
be	1
so	1
happy	1
to	1
see	1
you,"	1
said	1
she;	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
he	1
said	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
of	1
your	1
coming	1
with	1
Mamma?	1
I	1
forget	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
now,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
something	1
so	1
droll!"	1
After	1
an	1
hour	1
or	1
two	1
spent	1
in	1
what	1
her	1
mother	1
called	1
comfortable	1
chat,	1
or	1
in	1
other	1
words,	1
in	1
every	1
variety	1
of	1
inquiry	1
concerning	1
all	1
their	1
acquaintance	1
on	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings's	1
side,	1
and	1
in	1
laughter	1
without	1
cause	1
on	1
Mrs.	1
Palmer's,	1
it	1
was	1
proposed	1
by	1
the	1
latter	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
all	1
accompany	1
her	1
to	1
some	1
shops	1
where	1
she	1
had	1
business	1
that	1
morning,	1
to	1
which	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
and	1
Elinor	1
readily	1
consented,	1
as	1
having	1
likewise	1
some	1
purchases	1
to	1
make	1
themselves;	1
and	1
Marianne,	1
though	1
declining	1
it	1
at	1
first	1
was	1
induced	1
to	1
go	1
likewise.	1
Wherever	1
they	1
went,	1
she	1
was	1
evidently	1
always	1
on	1
the	1
watch.	1
In	1
Bond	1
Street	1
especially,	1
where	1
much	1
of	1
their	1
business	1
lay,	1
her	1
eyes	1
were	1
in	1
constant	1
inquiry;	1
and	1
in	1
whatever	1
shop	1
the	1
party	1
were	1
engaged,	1
her	1
mind	1
was	1
equally	1
abstracted	1
from	1
every	1
thing	1
actually	1
before	1
them,	1
from	1
all	1
that	1
interested	1
and	1
occupied	1
the	1
others.	1
Restless	1
and	1
dissatisfied	1
every	1
where,	1
her	1
sister	1
could	1
never	1
obtain	1
her	1
opinion	1
of	1
any	1
article	1
of	1
purchase,	1
however	1
it	1
might	1
equally	1
concern	1
them	1
both:	1
she	1
received	1
no	1
pleasure	1
from	1
anything;	1
was	1
only	1
impatient	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
home	1
again,	1
and	1
could	1
with	1
difficulty	1
govern	1
her	1
vexation	1
at	1
the	1
tediousness	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
Palmer,	1
whose	1
eye	1
was	1
caught	1
by	1
every	1
thing	1
pretty,	1
expensive,	1
or	1
new;	1
who	1
was	1
wild	1
to	1
buy	1
all,	1
could	1
determine	1
on	1
none,	1
and	1
dawdled	1
away	1
her	1
time	1
in	1
rapture	1
and	1
indecision.	1
It	1
was	1
late	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
before	1
they	1
returned	1
home;	1
and	1
no	1
sooner	1
had	1
they	1
entered	1
the	1
house	1
than	1
Marianne	1
flew	1
eagerly	1
up	1
stairs,	1
and	1
when	1
Elinor	1
followed,	1
she	1
found	1
her	1
turning	1
from	1
the	1
table	1
with	1
a	1
sorrowful	1
countenance,	1
which	1
declared	1
that	1
no	1
Willoughby	1
had	1
been	1
there.	1
"Has	1
no	1
letter	1
been	1
left	1
here	1
for	1
me	1
since	1
we	1
went	1
out?"	1
said	1
she	1
to	1
the	1
footman	1
who	1
then	1
entered	1
with	1
the	1
parcels.	1
She	1
was	1
answered	1
in	1
the	1
negative.	1
"Are	1
you	1
quite	1
sure	1
of	1
it?"	1
she	1
replied.	1
"Are	1
you	1
certain	1
that	1
no	1
servant,	1
no	1
porter	1
has	1
left	1
any	1
letter	1
or	1
note?"	1
The	1
man	1
replied	1
that	1
none	1
had.	1
"How	1
very	1
odd!"	1
said	1
she,	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
and	1
disappointed	1
voice,	1
as	1
she	1
turned	1
away	1
to	1
the	1
window.	1
"How	1
odd,	1
indeed!"	1
repeated	1
Elinor	1
within	1
herself,	1
regarding	1
her	1
sister	1
with	1
uneasiness.	1
"If	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
known	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
town	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
written	1
to	1
him,	1
as	1
she	1
did;	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
written	1
to	1
Combe	1
Magna;	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
is	1
in	1
town,	1
how	1
odd	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
neither	1
come	1
nor	1
write!	1
Oh!	1
my	1
dear	1
mother,	1
you	1
must	1
be	1
wrong	1
in	1
permitting	1
an	1
engagement	1
between	1
a	1
daughter	1
so	1
young,	1
a	1
man	1
so	1
little	1
known,	1
to	1
be	1
carried	1
on	1
in	1
so	1
doubtful,	1
so	1
mysterious	1
a	1
manner!	1
I	1
long	1
to	1
inquire;	1
and	1
how	1
will	1
MY	1
interference	1
be	1
borne."	1
She	1
determined,	1
after	1
some	1
consideration,	1
that	1
if	1
appearances	1
continued	1
many	1
days	1
longer	1
as	1
unpleasant	1
as	1
they	1
now	1
were,	1
she	1
would	1
represent	1
in	1
the	1
strongest	1
manner	1
to	1
her	1
mother	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
some	1
serious	1
enquiry	1
into	1
the	1
affair.	1
Mrs.	1
Palmer	1
and	1
two	1
elderly	1
ladies	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings's	1
intimate	1
acquaintance,	1
whom	1
she	1
had	1
met	1
and	1
invited	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
dined	1
with	1
them.	1
The	1
former	1
left	1
them	1
soon	1
after	1
tea	1
to	1
fulfill	1
her	1
evening	1
engagements;	1
and	1
Elinor	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
assist	1
in	1
making	1
a	1
whist	1
table	1
for	1
the	1
others.	1
Marianne	1
was	1
of	1
no	1
use	1
on	1
these	1
occasions,	1
as	1
she	1
would	1
never	1
learn	1
the	1
game;	1
but	1
though	1
her	1
time	1
was	1
therefore	1
at	1
her	1
own	1
disposal,	1
the	1
evening	1
was	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
more	1
productive	1
of	1
pleasure	1
to	1
her	1
than	1
to	1
Elinor,	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
spent	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
anxiety	1
of	1
expectation	1
and	1
the	1
pain	1
of	1
disappointment.	1
She	1
sometimes	1
endeavoured	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
to	1
read;	1
but	1
the	1
book	1
was	1
soon	1
thrown	1
aside,	1
and	1
she	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
more	1
interesting	1
employment	1
of	1
walking	1
backwards	1
and	1
forwards	1
across	1
the	1
room,	1
pausing	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
whenever	1
she	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
window,	1
in	1
hopes	1
of	1
distinguishing	1
the	1
long-expected	1
rap.	1
CHAPTER	1
27	1
"If	1
this	1
open	1
weather	1
holds	1
much	1
longer,"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings,	1
when	1
they	1
met	1
at	1
breakfast	1
the	1
following	1
morning,	1
"Sir	1
John	1
will	1
not	1
like	1
leaving	1
Barton	1
next	1
week;	1
'tis	1
a	1
sad	1
thing	1
for	1
sportsmen	1
to	1
lose	1
a	1
day's	1
pleasure.	1
Poor	1
souls!	1
I	1
always	1
pity	1
them	1
when	1
they	1
do;	1
they	1
seem	1
to	1
take	1
it	1
so	1
much	1
to	1
heart."	1
"That	1
is	1
true,"	1
cried	1
Marianne,	1
in	1
a	1
cheerful	1
voice,	1
and	1
walking	1
to	1
the	1
window	1
as	1
she	1
spoke,	1
to	1
examine	1
the	1
day.	1
"I	1
had	1
not	1
thought	1
of	1
that.	1
This	1
weather	1
will	1
keep	1
many	1
sportsmen	1
in	1
the	1
country."	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
lucky	1
recollection,	1
all	1
her	1
good	1
spirits	1
were	1
restored	1
by	1
it.	1
"It	1
is	1
charming	1
weather	1
for	1
THEM	1
indeed,"	1
she	1
continued,	1
as	1
she	1
sat	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
breakfast	1
table	1
with	1
a	1
happy	1
countenance.	1
"How	1
much	1
they	1
must	1
enjoy	1
it!	1
But"	1
(with	1
a	1
little	1
return	1
of	1
anxiety)	1
"it	1
cannot	1
be	1
expected	1
to	1
last	1
long.	1
At	1
this	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
year,	1
and	1
after	1
such	1
a	1
series	1
of	1
rain,	1
we	1
shall	1
certainly	1
have	1
very	1
little	1
more	1
of	1
it.	1
Frosts	1
will	1
soon	1
set	1
in,	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
probability	1
with	1
severity.	1
In	1
another	1
day	1
or	1
two	1
perhaps;	1
this	1
extreme	1
mildness	1
can	1
hardly	1
last	1
longer--nay,	1
perhaps	1
it	1
may	1
freeze	1
tonight!"	1
"At	1
any	1
rate,"	1
said	1
Elinor,	1
wishing	1
to	1
prevent	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
from	1
seeing	1
her	1
sister's	1
thoughts	1
as	1
clearly	1
as	1
she	1
did,	1
"I	1
dare	1
say	1
we	1
shall	1
have	1
Sir	1
John	1
and	1
Lady	1
Middleton	1
in	1
town	1
by	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
next	1
week."	1
"Ay,	1
my	1
dear,	1
I'll	1
warrant	1
you	1
we	1
do.	1
Mary	1
always	1
has	1
her	1
own	1
way."	1
"And	1
now,"	1
silently	1
conjectured	1
Elinor,	1
"she	1
will	1
write	1
to	1
Combe	1
by	1
this	1
day's	1
post."	1
But	1
if	1
she	1
DID,	1
the	1
letter	1
was	1
written	1
and	1
sent	1
away	1
with	1
a	1
privacy	1
which	1
eluded	1
all	1
her	1
watchfulness	1
to	1
ascertain	1
the	1
fact.	1
Whatever	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
it	1
might	1
be,	1
and	1
far	1
as	1
Elinor	1
was	1
from	1
feeling	1
thorough	1
contentment	1
about	1
it,	1
yet	1
while	1
she	1
saw	1
Marianne	1
in	1
spirits,	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
very	1
uncomfortable	1
herself.	1
And	1
Marianne	1
was	1
in	1
spirits;	1
happy	1
in	1
the	1
mildness	1
of	1
the	1
weather,	1
and	1
still	1
happier	1
in	1
her	1
expectation	1
of	1
a	1
frost.	1
The	1
morning	1
was	1
chiefly	1
spent	1
in	1
leaving	1
cards	1
at	1
the	1
houses	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings's	1
acquaintance	1
to	1
inform	1
them	1
of	1
her	1
being	1
in	1
town;	1
and	1
Marianne	1
was	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
busy	1
in	1
observing	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
the	1
wind,	1
watching	1
the	1
variations	1
of	1
the	1
sky	1
and	1
imagining	1
an	1
alteration	1
in	1
the	1
air.	1
"Don't	1
you	1
find	1
it	1
colder	1
than	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
Elinor?	1
There	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
a	1
very	1
decided	1
difference.	1
I	1
can	1
hardly	1
keep	1
my	1
hands	1
warm	1
even	1
in	1
my	1
muff.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
yesterday,	1
I	1
think.	1
The	1
clouds	1
seem	1
parting	1
too,	1
the	1
sun	1
will	1
be	1
out	1
in	1
a	1
moment,	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
have	1
a	1
clear	1
afternoon."	1
Elinor	1
was	1
alternately	1
diverted	1
and	1
pained;	1
but	1
Marianne	1
persevered,	1
and	1
saw	1
every	1
night	1
in	1
the	1
brightness	1
of	1
the	1
fire,	1
and	1
every	1
morning	1
in	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
the	1
atmosphere,	1
the	1
certain	1
symptoms	1
of	1
approaching	1
frost.	1
The	1
Miss	1
Dashwoods	1
had	1
no	1
greater	1
reason	1
to	1
be	1
dissatisfied	1
with	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings's	1
style	1
of	1
living,	1
and	1
set	1
of	1
acquaintance,	1
than	1
with	1
her	1
behaviour	1
to	1
themselves,	1
which	1
was	1
invariably	1
kind.	1
Every	1
thing	1
in	1
her	1
household	1
arrangements	1
was	1
conducted	1
on	1
the	1
most	1
liberal	1
plan,	1
and	1
excepting	1
a	1
few	1
old	1
city	1
friends,	1
whom,	1
to	1
Lady	1
Middleton's	1
regret,	1
she	1
had	1
never	1
dropped,	1
she	1
visited	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
whom	1
an	1
introduction	1
could	1
at	1
all	1
discompose	1
the	1
feelings	1
of	1
her	1
young	1
companions.	1
Pleased	1
to	1
find	1
herself	1
more	1
comfortably	1
situated	1
in	1
that	1
particular	1
than	1
she	1
had	1
expected,	1
Elinor	1
was	1
very	1
willing	1
to	1
compound	1
for	1
the	1
want	1
of	1
much	1
real	1
enjoyment	1
from	1
any	1
of	1
their	1
evening	1
parties,	1
which,	1
whether	1
at	1
home	1
or	1
abroad,	1
formed	1
only	1
for	1
cards,	1
could	1
have	1
little	1
to	1
amuse	1
her.	1
Colonel	1
Brandon,	1
who	1
had	1
a	1
general	1
invitation	1
to	1
the	1
house,	1
was	1
with	1
them	1
almost	1
every	1
day;	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
Marianne	1
and	1
talk	1
to	1
Elinor,	1
who	1
often	1
derived	1
more	1
satisfaction	1
from	1
conversing	1
with	1
him	1
than	1
from	1
any	1
other	1
daily	1
occurrence,	1
but	1
who	1
saw	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
with	1
much	1
concern	1
his	1
continued	1
regard	1
for	1
her	1
sister.	1
She	1
feared	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
strengthening	1
regard.	1
It	1
grieved	1
her	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
earnestness	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
often	1
watched	1
Marianne,	1
and	1
his	1
spirits	1
were	1
certainly	1
worse	1
than	1
when	1
at	1
Barton.	1
About	1
a	1
week	1
after	1
their	1
arrival,	1
it	1
became	1
certain	1
that	1
Willoughby	1
was	1
also	1
arrived.	1
His	1
card	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
when	1
they	1
came	1
in	1
from	1
the	1
morning's	1
drive.	1
"Good	1
God!"	1
cried	1
Marianne,	1
"he	1
has	1
been	1
here	1
while	1
we	1
were	1
out."	1
Elinor,	1
rejoiced	1
to	1
be	1
assured	1
of	1
his	1
being	1
in	1
London,	1
now	1
ventured	1
to	1
say,	1
"Depend	1
upon	1
it,	1
he	1
will	1
call	1
again	1
tomorrow."	1
But	1
Marianne	1
seemed	1
hardly	1
to	1
hear	1
her,	1
and	1
on	1
Mrs.	1
Jenning's	1
entrance,	1
escaped	1
with	1
the	1
precious	1
card.	1
This	1
event,	1
while	1
it	1
raised	1
the	1
spirits	1
of	1
Elinor,	1
restored	1
to	1
those	1
of	1
her	1
sister	1
all,	1
and	1
more	1
than	1
all,	1
their	1
former	1
agitation.	1
From	1
this	1
moment	1
her	1
mind	1
was	1
never	1
quiet;	1
the	1
expectation	1
of	1
seeing	1
him	1
every	1
hour	1
of	1
the	1
day,	1
made	1
her	1
unfit	1
for	1
any	1
thing.	1
She	1
insisted	1
on	1
being	1
left	1
behind,	1
the	1
next	1
morning,	1
when	1
the	1
others	1
went	1
out.	1
Elinor's	1
thoughts	1
were	1
full	1
of	1
what	1
might	1
be	1
passing	1
in	1
Berkeley	1
Street	1
during	1
their	1
absence;	1
but	1
a	1
moment's	1
glance	1
at	1
her	1
sister	1
when	1
they	1
returned	1
was	1
enough	1
to	1
inform	1
her,	1
that	1
Willoughby	1
had	1
paid	1
no	1
second	1
visit	1
there.	1
A	1
note	1
was	1
just	1
then	1
brought	1
in,	1
and	1
laid	1
on	1
the	1
table,	1
"For	1
me!"	1
cried	1
Marianne,	1
stepping	1
hastily	1
forward.	1
"No,	1
ma'am,	1
for	1
my	1
mistress."	1
But	1
Marianne,	1
not	1
convinced,	1
took	1
it	1
instantly	1
up.	1
"It	1
is	1
indeed	1
for	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings;	1
how	1
provoking!"	1
"You	1
are	1
expecting	1
a	1
letter,	1
then?"	1
said	1
Elinor,	1
unable	1
to	1
be	1
longer	1
silent.	1
"Yes,	1
a	1
little--not	1
much."	1
After	1
a	1
short	1
pause.	1
"You	1
have	1
no	1
confidence	1
in	1
me,	1
Marianne."	1
"Nay,	1
Elinor,	1
this	1
reproach	1
from	1
YOU--you	1
who	1
have	1
confidence	1
in	1
no	1
one!"	1
"Me!"	1
returned	1
Elinor	1
in	1
some	1
confusion;	1
"indeed,	1
Marianne,	1
I	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
tell."	1
"Nor	1
I,"	1
answered	1
Marianne	1
with	1
energy,	1
"our	1
situations	1
then	1
are	1
alike.	1
We	1
have	1
neither	1
of	1
us	1
any	1
thing	1
to	1
tell;	1
you,	1
because	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
communicate,	1
and	1
I,	1
because	1
I	1
conceal	1
nothing."	1
Elinor,	1
distressed	1
by	1
this	1
charge	1
of	1
reserve	1
in	1
herself,	1
which	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
at	1
liberty	1
to	1
do	1
away,	1
knew	1
not	1
how,	1
under	1
such	1
circumstances,	1
to	1
press	1
for	1
greater	1
openness	1
in	1
Marianne.	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
soon	1
appeared,	1
and	1
the	1
note	1
being	1
given	1
her,	1
she	1
read	1
it	1
aloud.	1
It	1
was	1
from	1
Lady	1
Middleton,	1
announcing	1
their	1
arrival	1
in	1
Conduit	1
Street	1
the	1
night	1
before,	1
and	1
requesting	1
the	1
company	1
of	1
her	1
mother	1
and	1
cousins	1
the	1
following	1
evening.	1
Business	1
on	1
Sir	1
John's	1
part,	1
and	1
a	1
violent	1
cold	1
on	1
her	1
own,	1
prevented	1
their	1
calling	1
in	1
Berkeley	1
Street.	1
The	1
invitation	1
was	1
accepted;	1
but	1
when	1
the	1
hour	1
of	1
appointment	1
drew	1
near,	1
necessary	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
common	1
civility	1
to	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
both	1
attend	1
her	1
on	1
such	1
a	1
visit,	1
Elinor	1
had	1
some	1
difficulty	1
in	1
persuading	1
her	1
sister	1
to	1
go,	1
for	1
still	1
she	1
had	1
seen	1
nothing	1
of	1
Willoughby;	1
and	1
therefore	1
was	1
not	1
more	1
indisposed	1
for	1
amusement	1
abroad,	1
than	1
unwilling	1
to	1
run	1
the	1
risk	1
of	1
his	1
calling	1
again	1
in	1
her	1
absence.	1
Elinor	1
found,	1
when	1
the	1
evening	1
was	1
over,	1
that	1
disposition	1
is	1
not	1
materially	1
altered	1
by	1
a	1
change	1
of	1
abode,	1
for	1
although	1
scarcely	1
settled	1
in	1
town,	1
Sir	1
John	1
had	1
contrived	1
to	1
collect	1
around	1
him,	1
nearly	1
twenty	1
young	1
people,	1
and	1
to	1
amuse	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
ball.	1
This	1
was	1
an	1
affair,	1
however,	1
of	1
which	1
Lady	1
Middleton	1
did	1
not	1
approve.	1
In	1
the	1
country,	1
an	1
unpremeditated	1
dance	1
was	1
very	1
allowable;	1
but	1
in	1
London,	1
where	1
the	1
reputation	1
of	1
elegance	1
was	1
more	1
important	1
and	1
less	1
easily	1
attained,	1
it	1
was	1
risking	1
too	1
much	1
for	1
the	1
gratification	1
of	1
a	1
few	1
girls,	1
to	1
have	1
it	1
known	1
that	1
Lady	1
Middleton	1
had	1
given	1
a	1
small	1
dance	1
of	1
eight	1
or	1
nine	1
couple,	1
with	1
two	1
violins,	1
and	1
a	1
mere	1
side-board	1
collation.	1
Mr.	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Palmer	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
party;	1
from	1
the	1
former,	1
whom	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
before	1
since	1
their	1
arrival	1
in	1
town,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
careful	1
to	1
avoid	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
any	1
attention	1
to	1
his	1
mother-in-law,	1
and	1
therefore	1
never	1
came	1
near	1
her,	1
they	1
received	1
no	1
mark	1
of	1
recognition	1
on	1
their	1
entrance.	1
He	1
looked	1
at	1
them	1
slightly,	1
without	1
seeming	1
to	1
know	1
who	1
they	1
were,	1
and	1
merely	1
nodded	1
to	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
from	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
room.	1
Marianne	1
gave	1
one	1
glance	1
round	1
the	1
apartment	1
as	1
she	1
entered:	1
it	1
was	1
enough--HE	1
was	1
not	1
there--and	1
she	1
sat	1
down,	1
equally	1
ill-disposed	1
to	1
receive	1
or	1
communicate	1
pleasure.	1
After	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
assembled	1
about	1
an	1
hour,	1
Mr.	1
Palmer	1
sauntered	1
towards	1
the	1
Miss	1
Dashwoods	1
to	1
express	1
his	1
surprise	1
on	1
seeing	1
them	1
in	1
town,	1
though	1
Colonel	1
Brandon	1
had	1
been	1
first	1
informed	1
of	1
their	1
arrival	1
at	1
his	1
house,	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
himself	1
said	1
something	1
very	1
droll	1
on	1
hearing	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
come.	1
"I	1
thought	1
you	1
were	1
both	1
in	1
Devonshire,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"Did	1
you?"	1
replied	1
Elinor.	1
"When	1
do	1
you	1
go	1
back	1
again?"	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
know."	1
And	1
thus	1
ended	1
their	1
discourse.	1
Never	1
had	1
Marianne	1
been	1
so	1
unwilling	1
to	1
dance	1
in	1
her	1
life,	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
that	1
evening,	1
and	1
never	1
so	1
much	1
fatigued	1
by	1
the	1
exercise.	1
She	1
complained	1
of	1
it	1
as	1
they	1
returned	1
to	1
Berkeley	1
Street.	1
"Aye,	1
aye,"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings,	1
"we	1
know	1
the	1
reason	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
very	1
well;	1
if	1
a	1
certain	1
person	1
who	1
shall	1
be	1
nameless,	1
had	1
been	1
there,	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
bit	1
tired:	1
and	1
to	1
say	1
the	1
truth	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
very	1
pretty	1
of	1
him	1
not	1
to	1
give	1
you	1
the	1
meeting	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
invited."	1
"Invited!"	1
cried	1
Marianne.	1
"So	1
my	1
daughter	1
Middleton	1
told	1
me,	1
for	1
it	1
seems	1
Sir	1
John	1
met	1
him	1
somewhere	1
in	1
the	1
street	1
this	1
morning."	1
Marianne	1
said	1
no	1
more,	1
but	1
looked	1
exceedingly	1
hurt.	1
Impatient	1
in	1
this	1
situation	1
to	1
be	1
doing	1
something	1
that	1
might	1
lead	1
to	1
her	1
sister's	1
relief,	1
Elinor	1
resolved	1
to	1
write	1
the	1
next	1
morning	1
to	1
her	1
mother,	1
and	1
hoped	1
by	1
awakening	1
her	1
fears	1
for	1
the	1
health	1
of	1
Marianne,	1
to	1
procure	1
those	1
inquiries	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
long	1
delayed;	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
still	1
more	1
eagerly	1
bent	1
on	1
this	1
measure	1
by	1
perceiving	1
after	1
breakfast	1
on	1
the	1
morrow,	1
that	1
Marianne	1
was	1
again	1
writing	1
to	1
Willoughby,	1
for	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
suppose	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
to	1
any	1
other	1
person.	1
About	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
day,	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
went	1
out	1
by	1
herself	1
on	1
business,	1
and	1
Elinor	1
began	1
her	1
letter	1
directly,	1
while	1
Marianne,	1
too	1
restless	1
for	1
employment,	1
too	1
anxious	1
for	1
conversation,	1
walked	1
from	1
one	1
window	1
to	1
the	1
other,	1
or	1
sat	1
down	1
by	1
the	1
fire	1
in	1
melancholy	1
meditation.	1
Elinor	1
was	1
very	1
earnest	1
in	1
her	1
application	1
to	1
her	1
mother,	1
relating	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
passed,	1
her	1
suspicions	1
of	1
Willoughby's	1
inconstancy,	1
urging	1
her	1
by	1
every	1
plea	1
of	1
duty	1
and	1
affection	1
to	1
demand	1
from	1
Marianne	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
her	1
real	1
situation	1
with	1
respect	1
to	1
him.	1
Her	1
letter	1
was	1
scarcely	1
finished,	1
when	1
a	1
rap	1
foretold	1
a	1
visitor,	1
and	1
Colonel	1
Brandon	1
was	1
announced.	1
Marianne,	1
who	1
had	1
seen	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
window,	1
and	1
who	1
hated	1
company	1
of	1
any	1
kind,	1
left	1
the	1
room	1
before	1
he	1
entered	1
it.	1
He	1
looked	1
more	1
than	1
usually	1
grave,	1
and	1
though	1
expressing	1
satisfaction	1
at	1
finding	1
Miss	1
Dashwood	1
alone,	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
somewhat	1
in	1
particular	1
to	1
tell	1
her,	1
sat	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
without	1
saying	1
a	1
word.	1
Elinor,	1
persuaded	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
some	1
communication	1
to	1
make	1
in	1
which	1
her	1
sister	1
was	1
concerned,	1
impatiently	1
expected	1
its	1
opening.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
of	1
her	1
feeling	1
the	1
same	1
kind	1
of	1
conviction;	1
for,	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
before,	1
beginning	1
with	1
the	1
observation	1
of	1
"your	1
sister	1
looks	1
unwell	1
to-day,"	1
or	1
"your	1
sister	1
seems	1
out	1
of	1
spirits,"	1
he	1
had	1
appeared	1
on	1
the	1
point,	1
either	1
of	1
disclosing,	1
or	1
of	1
inquiring,	1
something	1
particular	1
about	1
her.	1
After	1
a	1
pause	1
of	1
several	1
minutes,	1
their	1
silence	1
was	1
broken,	1
by	1
his	1
asking	1
her	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
of	1
some	1
agitation,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
congratulate	1
her	1
on	1
the	1
acquisition	1
of	1
a	1
brother?	1
Elinor	1
was	1
not	1
prepared	1
for	1
such	1
a	1
question,	1
and	1
having	1
no	1
answer	1
ready,	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
adopt	1
the	1
simple	1
and	1
common	1
expedient,	1
of	1
asking	1
what	1
he	1
meant?	1
He	1
tried	1
to	1
smile	1
as	1
he	1
replied,	1
"your	1
sister's	1
engagement	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Willoughby	1
is	1
very	1
generally	1
known."	1
"It	1
cannot	1
be	1
generally	1
known,"	1
returned	1
Elinor,	1
"for	1
her	1
own	1
family	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
it."	1
He	1
looked	1
surprised	1
and	1
said,	1
"I	1
beg	1
your	1
pardon,	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
my	1
inquiry	1
has	1
been	1
impertinent;	1
but	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
supposed	1
any	1
secrecy	1
intended,	1
as	1
they	1
openly	1
correspond,	1
and	1
their	1
marriage	1
is	1
universally	1
talked	1
of."	1
"How	1
can	1
that	1
be?	1
By	1
whom	1
can	1
you	1
have	1
heard	1
it	1
mentioned?"	1
"By	1
many--by	1
some	1
of	1
whom	1
you	1
know	1
nothing,	1
by	1
others	1
with	1
whom	1
you	1
are	1
most	1
intimate,	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings,	1
Mrs.	1
Palmer,	1
and	1
the	1
Middletons.	1
But	1
still	1
I	1
might	1
not	1
have	1
believed	1
it,	1
for	1
where	1
the	1
mind	1
is	1
perhaps	1
rather	1
unwilling	1
to	1
be	1
convinced,	1
it	1
will	1
always	1
find	1
something	1
to	1
support	1
its	1
doubts,	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
not,	1
when	1
the	1
servant	1
let	1
me	1
in	1
today,	1
accidentally	1
seen	1
a	1
letter	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
directed	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Willoughby	1
in	1
your	1
sister's	1
writing.	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
inquire,	1
but	1
I	1
was	1
convinced	1
before	1
I	1
could	1
ask	1
the	1
question.	1
Is	1
every	1
thing	1
finally	1
settled?	1
Is	1
it	1
impossible	1
to-?	1
But	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
right,	1
and	1
I	1
could	1
have	1
no	1
chance	1
of	1
succeeding.	1
Excuse	1
me,	1
Miss	1
Dashwood.	1
I	1
believe	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
wrong	1
in	1
saying	1
so	1
much,	1
but	1
I	1
hardly	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
do,	1
and	1
on	1
your	1
prudence	1
I	1
have	1
the	1
strongest	1
dependence.	1
Tell	1
me	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
all	1
absolutely	1
resolved	1
on,	1
that	1
any	1
attempt,	1
that	1
in	1
short	1
concealment,	1
if	1
concealment	1
be	1
possible,	1
is	1
all	1
that	1
remains."	1
These	1
words,	1
which	1
conveyed	1
to	1
Elinor	1
a	1
direct	1
avowal	1
of	1
his	1
love	1
for	1
her	1
sister,	1
affected	1
her	1
very	1
much.	1
She	1
was	1
not	1
immediately	1
able	1
to	1
say	1
anything,	1
and	1
even	1
when	1
her	1
spirits	1
were	1
recovered,	1
she	1
debated	1
for	1
a	1
short	1
time,	1
on	1
the	1
answer	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
most	1
proper	1
to	1
give.	1
The	1
real	1
state	1
of	1
things	1
between	1
Willoughby	1
and	1
her	1
sister	1
was	1
so	1
little	1
known	1
to	1
herself,	1
that	1
in	1
endeavouring	1
to	1
explain	1
it,	1
she	1
might	1
be	1
as	1
liable	1
to	1
say	1
too	1
much	1
as	1
too	1
little.	1
Yet	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
convinced	1
that	1
Marianne's	1
affection	1
for	1
Willoughby,	1
could	1
leave	1
no	1
hope	1
of	1
Colonel	1
Brandon's	1
success,	1
whatever	1
the	1
event	1
of	1
that	1
affection	1
might	1
be,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
wished	1
to	1
shield	1
her	1
conduct	1
from	1
censure,	1
she	1
thought	1
it	1
most	1
prudent	1
and	1
kind,	1
after	1
some	1
consideration,	1
to	1
say	1
more	1
than	1
she	1
really	1
knew	1
or	1
believed.	1
She	1
acknowledged,	1
therefore,	1
that	1
though	1
she	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
informed	1
by	1
themselves	1
of	1
the	1
terms	1
on	1
which	1
they	1
stood	1
with	1
each	1
other,	1
of	1
their	1
mutual	1
affection	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
doubt,	1
and	1
of	1
their	1
correspondence	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
astonished	1
to	1
hear.	1
He	1
listened	1
to	1
her	1
with	1
silent	1
attention,	1
and	1
on	1
her	1
ceasing	1
to	1
speak,	1
rose	1
directly	1
from	1
his	1
seat,	1
and	1
after	1
saying	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
of	1
emotion,	1
"to	1
your	1
sister	1
I	1
wish	1
all	1
imaginable	1
happiness;	1
to	1
Willoughby	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
endeavour	1
to	1
deserve	1
her,"--took	1
leave,	1
and	1
went	1
away.	1
Elinor	1
derived	1
no	1
comfortable	1
feelings	1
from	1
this	1
conversation,	1
to	1
lessen	1
the	1
uneasiness	1
of	1
her	1
mind	1
on	1
other	1
points;	1
she	1
was	1
left,	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
with	1
a	1
melancholy	1
impression	1
of	1
Colonel	1
Brandon's	1
unhappiness,	1
and	1
was	1
prevented	1
even	1
from	1
wishing	1
it	1
removed,	1
by	1
her	1
anxiety	1
for	1
the	1
very	1
event	1
that	1
must	1
confirm	1
it.	1
CHAPTER	1
28	1
Nothing	1
occurred	1
during	1
the	1
next	1
three	1
or	1
four	1
days,	1
to	1
make	1
Elinor	1
regret	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
done,	1
in	1
applying	1
to	1
her	1
mother;	1
for	1
Willoughby	1
neither	1
came	1
nor	1
wrote.	1
They	1
were	1
engaged	1
about	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
that	1
time	1
to	1
attend	1
Lady	1
Middleton	1
to	1
a	1
party,	1
from	1
which	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
was	1
kept	1
away	1
by	1
the	1
indisposition	1
of	1
her	1
youngest	1
daughter;	1
and	1
for	1
this	1
party,	1
Marianne,	1
wholly	1
dispirited,	1
careless	1
of	1
her	1
appearance,	1
and	1
seeming	1
equally	1
indifferent	1
whether	1
she	1
went	1
or	1
staid,	1
prepared,	1
without	1
one	1
look	1
of	1
hope	1
or	1
one	1
expression	1
of	1
pleasure.	1
She	1
sat	1
by	1
the	1
drawing-room	1
fire	1
after	1
tea,	1
till	1
the	1
moment	1
of	1
Lady	1
Middleton's	1
arrival,	1
without	1
once	1
stirring	1
from	1
her	1
seat,	1
or	1
altering	1
her	1
attitude,	1
lost	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
thoughts,	1
and	1
insensible	1
of	1
her	1
sister's	1
presence;	1
and	1
when	1
at	1
last	1
they	1
were	1
told	1
that	1
Lady	1
Middleton	1
waited	1
for	1
them	1
at	1
the	1
door,	1
she	1
started	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
forgotten	1
that	1
any	1
one	1
was	1
expected.	1
They	1
arrived	1
in	1
due	1
time	1
at	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
destination,	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
string	1
of	1
carriages	1
before	1
them	1
would	1
allow,	1
alighted,	1
ascended	1
the	1
stairs,	1
heard	1
their	1
names	1
announced	1
from	1
one	1
landing-place	1
to	1
another	1
in	1
an	1
audible	1
voice,	1
and	1
entered	1
a	1
room	1
splendidly	1
lit	1
up,	1
quite	1
full	1
of	1
company,	1
and	1
insufferably	1
hot.	1
When	1
they	1
had	1
paid	1
their	1
tribute	1
of	1
politeness	1
by	1
curtsying	1
to	1
the	1
lady	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
they	1
were	1
permitted	1
to	1
mingle	1
in	1
the	1
crowd,	1
and	1
take	1
their	1
share	1
of	1
the	1
heat	1
and	1
inconvenience,	1
to	1
which	1
their	1
arrival	1
must	1
necessarily	1
add.	1
After	1
some	1
time	1
spent	1
in	1
saying	1
little	1
or	1
doing	1
less,	1
Lady	1
Middleton	1
sat	1
down	1
to	1
Cassino,	1
and	1
as	1
Marianne	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
spirits	1
for	1
moving	1
about,	1
she	1
and	1
Elinor	1
luckily	1
succeeding	1
to	1
chairs,	1
placed	1
themselves	1
at	1
no	1
great	1
distance	1
from	1
the	1
table.	1
They	1
had	1
not	1
remained	1
in	1
this	1
manner	1
long,	1
before	1
Elinor	1
perceived	1
Willoughby,	1
standing	1
within	1
a	1
few	1
yards	1
of	1
them,	1
in	1
earnest	1
conversation	1
with	1
a	1
very	1
fashionable	1
looking	1
young	1
woman.	1
She	1
soon	1
caught	1
his	1
eye,	1
and	1
he	1
immediately	1
bowed,	1
but	1
without	1
attempting	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
her,	1
or	1
to	1
approach	1
Marianne,	1
though	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
see	1
her;	1
and	1
then	1
continued	1
his	1
discourse	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
lady.	1
Elinor	1
turned	1
involuntarily	1
to	1
Marianne,	1
to	1
see	1
whether	1
it	1
could	1
be	1
unobserved	1
by	1
her.	1
At	1
that	1
moment	1
she	1
first	1
perceived	1
him,	1
and	1
her	1
whole	1
countenance	1
glowing	1
with	1
sudden	1
delight,	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
moved	1
towards	1
him	1
instantly,	1
had	1
not	1
her	1
sister	1
caught	1
hold	1
of	1
her.	1
"Good	1
heavens!"	1
she	1
exclaimed,	1
"he	1
is	1
there--he	1
is	1
there--Oh!	1
why	1
does	1
he	1
not	1
look	1
at	1
me?	1
why	1
cannot	1
I	1
speak	1
to	1
him?"	1
"Pray,	1
pray	1
be	1
composed,"	1
cried	1
Elinor,	1
"and	1
do	1
not	1
betray	1
what	1
you	1
feel	1
to	1
every	1
body	1
present.	1
Perhaps	1
he	1
has	1
not	1
observed	1
you	1
yet."	1
This	1
however	1
was	1
more	1
than	1
she	1
could	1
believe	1
herself;	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
composed	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
moment	1
was	1
not	1
only	1
beyond	1
the	1
reach	1
of	1
Marianne,	1
it	1
was	1
beyond	1
her	1
wish.	1
She	1
sat	1
in	1
an	1
agony	1
of	1
impatience	1
which	1
affected	1
every	1
feature.	1
At	1
last	1
he	1
turned	1
round	1
again,	1
and	1
regarded	1
them	1
both;	1
she	1
started	1
up,	1
and	1
pronouncing	1
his	1
name	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
of	1
affection,	1
held	1
out	1
her	1
hand	1
to	1
him.	1
He	1
approached,	1
and	1
addressing	1
himself	1
rather	1
to	1
Elinor	1
than	1
Marianne,	1
as	1
if	1
wishing	1
to	1
avoid	1
her	1
eye,	1
and	1
determined	1
not	1
to	1
observe	1
her	1
attitude,	1
inquired	1
in	1
a	1
hurried	1
manner	1
after	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood,	1
and	1
asked	1
how	1
long	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
town.	1
Elinor	1
was	1
robbed	1
of	1
all	1
presence	1
of	1
mind	1
by	1
such	1
an	1
address,	1
and	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
say	1
a	1
word.	1
But	1
the	1
feelings	1
of	1
her	1
sister	1
were	1
instantly	1
expressed.	1
Her	1
face	1
was	1
crimsoned	1
over,	1
and	1
she	1
exclaimed,	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
greatest	1
emotion,	1
"Good	1
God!	1
Willoughby,	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
this?	1
Have	1
you	1
not	1
received	1
my	1
letters?	1
Will	1
you	1
not	1
shake	1
hands	1
with	1
me?"	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
then	1
avoid	1
it,	1
but	1
her	1
touch	1
seemed	1
painful	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
held	1
her	1
hand	1
only	1
for	1
a	1
moment.	1
During	1
all	1
this	1
time	1
he	1
was	1
evidently	1
struggling	1
for	1
composure.	1
Elinor	1
watched	1
his	1
countenance	1
and	1
saw	1
its	1
expression	1
becoming	1
more	1
tranquil.	1
After	1
a	1
moment's	1
pause,	1
he	1
spoke	1
with	1
calmness.	1
"I	1
did	1
myself	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
calling	1
in	1
Berkeley	1
Street	1
last	1
Tuesday,	1
and	1
very	1
much	1
regretted	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
fortunate	1
enough	1
to	1
find	1
yourselves	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
at	1
home.	1
My	1
card	1
was	1
not	1
lost,	1
I	1
hope."	1
"But	1
have	1
you	1
not	1
received	1
my	1
notes?"	1
cried	1
Marianne	1
in	1
the	1
wildest	1
anxiety.	1
"Here	1
is	1
some	1
mistake	1
I	1
am	1
sure--some	1
dreadful	1
mistake.	1
What	1
can	1
be	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
it?	1
Tell	1
me,	1
Willoughby;	1
for	1
heaven's	1
sake	1
tell	1
me,	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
matter?"	1
He	1
made	1
no	1
reply;	1
his	1
complexion	1
changed	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
embarrassment	1
returned;	1
but	1
as	1
if,	1
on	1
catching	1
the	1
eye	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
lady	1
with	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
previously	1
talking,	1
he	1
felt	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
instant	1
exertion,	1
he	1
recovered	1
himself	1
again,	1
and	1
after	1
saying,	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
had	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
receiving	1
the	1
information	1
of	1
your	1
arrival	1
in	1
town,	1
which	1
you	1
were	1
so	1
good	1
as	1
to	1
send	1
me,"	1
turned	1
hastily	1
away	1
with	1
a	1
slight	1
bow	1
and	1
joined	1
his	1
friend.	1
Marianne,	1
now	1
looking	1
dreadfully	1
white,	1
and	1
unable	1
to	1
stand,	1
sunk	1
into	1
her	1
chair,	1
and	1
Elinor,	1
expecting	1
every	1
moment	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
faint,	1
tried	1
to	1
screen	1
her	1
from	1
the	1
observation	1
of	1
others,	1
while	1
reviving	1
her	1
with	1
lavender	1
water.	1
"Go	1
to	1
him,	1
Elinor,"	1
she	1
cried,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
could	1
speak,	1
"and	1
force	1
him	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
me.	1
Tell	1
him	1
I	1
must	1
see	1
him	1
again--must	1
speak	1
to	1
him	1
instantly.--	1
I	1
cannot	1
rest--I	1
shall	1
not	1
have	1
a	1
moment's	1
peace	1
till	1
this	1
is	1
explained--some	1
dreadful	1
misapprehension	1
or	1
other.--	1
Oh	1
go	1
to	1
him	1
this	1
moment."	1
"How	1
can	1
that	1
be	1
done?	1
No,	1
my	1
dearest	1
Marianne,	1
you	1
must	1
wait.	1
This	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
place	1
for	1
explanations.	1
Wait	1
only	1
till	1
tomorrow."	1
With	1
difficulty	1
however	1
could	1
she	1
prevent	1
her	1
from	1
following	1
him	1
herself;	1
and	1
to	1
persuade	1
her	1
to	1
check	1
her	1
agitation,	1
to	1
wait,	1
at	1
least,	1
with	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
composure,	1
till	1
she	1
might	1
speak	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
more	1
privacy	1
and	1
more	1
effect,	1
was	1
impossible;	1
for	1
Marianne	1
continued	1
incessantly	1
to	1
give	1
way	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice	1
to	1
the	1
misery	1
of	1
her	1
feelings,	1
by	1
exclamations	1
of	1
wretchedness.	1
In	1
a	1
short	1
time	1
Elinor	1
saw	1
Willoughby	1
quit	1
the	1
room	1
by	1
the	1
door	1
towards	1
the	1
staircase,	1
and	1
telling	1
Marianne	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
gone,	1
urged	1
the	1
impossibility	1
of	1
speaking	1
to	1
him	1
again	1
that	1
evening,	1
as	1
a	1
fresh	1
argument	1
for	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
calm.	1
She	1
instantly	1
begged	1
her	1
sister	1
would	1
entreat	1
Lady	1
Middleton	1
to	1
take	1
them	1
home,	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
too	1
miserable	1
to	1
stay	1
a	1
minute	1
longer.	1
Lady	1
Middleton,	1
though	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
a	1
rubber,	1
on	1
being	1
informed	1
that	1
Marianne	1
was	1
unwell,	1
was	1
too	1
polite	1
to	1
object	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
to	1
her	1
wish	1
of	1
going	1
away,	1
and	1
making	1
over	1
her	1
cards	1
to	1
a	1
friend,	1
they	1
departed	1
as	1
soon	1
the	1
carriage	1
could	1
be	1
found.	1
Scarcely	1
a	1
word	1
was	1
spoken	1
during	1
their	1
return	1
to	1
Berkeley	1
Street.	1
Marianne	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
silent	1
agony,	1
too	1
much	1
oppressed	1
even	1
for	1
tears;	1
but	1
as	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
was	1
luckily	1
not	1
come	1
home,	1
they	1
could	1
go	1
directly	1
to	1
their	1
own	1
room,	1
where	1
hartshorn	1
restored	1
her	1
a	1
little	1
to	1
herself.	1
She	1
was	1
soon	1
undressed	1
and	1
in	1
bed,	1
and	1
as	1
she	1
seemed	1
desirous	1
of	1
being	1
alone,	1
her	1
sister	1
then	1
left	1
her,	1
and	1
while	1
she	1
waited	1
the	1
return	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings,	1
had	1
leisure	1
enough	1
for	1
thinking	1
over	1
the	1
past.	1
That	1
some	1
kind	1
of	1
engagement	1
had	1
subsisted	1
between	1
Willoughby	1
and	1
Marianne	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
doubt,	1
and	1
that	1
Willoughby	1
was	1
weary	1
of	1
it,	1
seemed	1
equally	1
clear;	1
for	1
however	1
Marianne	1
might	1
still	1
feed	1
her	1
own	1
wishes,	1
SHE	1
could	1
not	1
attribute	1
such	1
behaviour	1
to	1
mistake	1
or	1
misapprehension	1
of	1
any	1
kind.	1
Nothing	1
but	1
a	1
thorough	1
change	1
of	1
sentiment	1
could	1
account	1
for	1
it.	1
Her	1
indignation	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
still	1
stronger	1
than	1
it	1
was,	1
had	1
she	1
not	1
witnessed	1
that	1
embarrassment	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
speak	1
a	1
consciousness	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
misconduct,	1
and	1
prevented	1
her	1
from	1
believing	1
him	1
so	1
unprincipled	1
as	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
sporting	1
with	1
the	1
affections	1
of	1
her	1
sister	1
from	1
the	1
first,	1
without	1
any	1
design	1
that	1
would	1
bear	1
investigation.	1
Absence	1
might	1
have	1
weakened	1
his	1
regard,	1
and	1
convenience	1
might	1
have	1
determined	1
him	1
to	1
overcome	1
it,	1
but	1
that	1
such	1
a	1
regard	1
had	1
formerly	1
existed	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
bring	1
herself	1
to	1
doubt.	1
As	1
for	1
Marianne,	1
on	1
the	1
pangs	1
which	1
so	1
unhappy	1
a	1
meeting	1
must	1
already	1
have	1
given	1
her,	1
and	1
on	1
those	1
still	1
more	1
severe	1
which	1
might	1
await	1
her	1
in	1
its	1
probable	1
consequence,	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
reflect	1
without	1
the	1
deepest	1
concern.	1
Her	1
own	1
situation	1
gained	1
in	1
the	1
comparison;	1
for	1
while	1
she	1
could	1
ESTEEM	1
Edward	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
ever,	1
however	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
divided	1
in	1
future,	1
her	1
mind	1
might	1
be	1
always	1
supported.	1
But	1
every	1
circumstance	1
that	1
could	1
embitter	1
such	1
an	1
evil	1
seemed	1
uniting	1
to	1
heighten	1
the	1
misery	1
of	1
Marianne	1
in	1
a	1
final	1
separation	1
from	1
Willoughby--in	1
an	1
immediate	1
and	1
irreconcilable	1
rupture	1
with	1
him.	1
CHAPTER	1
29	1
Before	1
the	1
house-maid	1
had	1
lit	1
their	1
fire	1
the	1
next	1
day,	1
or	1
the	1
sun	1
gained	1
any	1
power	1
over	1
a	1
cold,	1
gloomy	1
morning	1
in	1
January,	1
Marianne,	1
only	1
half	1
dressed,	1
was	1
kneeling	1
against	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
window-seats	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
little	1
light	1
she	1
could	1
command	1
from	1
it,	1
and	1
writing	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
a	1
continual	1
flow	1
of	1
tears	1
would	1
permit	1
her.	1
In	1
this	1
situation,	1
Elinor,	1
roused	1
from	1
sleep	1
by	1
her	1
agitation	1
and	1
sobs,	1
first	1
perceived	1
her;	1
and	1
after	1
observing	1
her	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
moments	1
with	1
silent	1
anxiety,	1
said,	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
considerate	1
gentleness,	1
"Marianne,	1
may	1
I	1
ask-?"	1
"No,	1
Elinor,"	1
she	1
replied,	1
"ask	1
nothing;	1
you	1
will	1
soon	1
know	1
all."	1
The	1
sort	1
of	1
desperate	1
calmness	1
with	1
which	1
this	1
was	1
said,	1
lasted	1
no	1
longer	1
than	1
while	1
she	1
spoke,	1
and	1
was	1
immediately	1
followed	1
by	1
a	1
return	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
excessive	1
affliction.	1
It	1
was	1
some	1
minutes	1
before	1
she	1
could	1
go	1
on	1
with	1
her	1
letter,	1
and	1
the	1
frequent	1
bursts	1
of	1
grief	1
which	1
still	1
obliged	1
her,	1
at	1
intervals,	1
to	1
withhold	1
her	1
pen,	1
were	1
proofs	1
enough	1
of	1
her	1
feeling	1
how	1
more	1
than	1
probable	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
writing	1
for	1
the	1
last	1
time	1
to	1
Willoughby.	1
Elinor	1
paid	1
her	1
every	1
quiet	1
and	1
unobtrusive	1
attention	1
in	1
her	1
power;	1
and	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
tried	1
to	1
sooth	1
and	1
tranquilize	1
her	1
still	1
more,	1
had	1
not	1
Marianne	1
entreated	1
her,	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
eagerness	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
nervous	1
irritability,	1
not	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
her	1
for	1
the	1
world.	1
In	1
such	1
circumstances,	1
it	1
was	1
better	1
for	1
both	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
long	1
together;	1
and	1
the	1
restless	1
state	1
of	1
Marianne's	1
mind	1
not	1
only	1
prevented	1
her	1
from	1
remaining	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
a	1
moment	1
after	1
she	1
was	1
dressed,	1
but	1
requiring	1
at	1
once	1
solitude	1
and	1
continual	1
change	1
of	1
place,	1
made	1
her	1
wander	1
about	1
the	1
house	1
till	1
breakfast	1
time,	1
avoiding	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
every	1
body.	1
At	1
breakfast	1
she	1
neither	1
ate,	1
nor	1
attempted	1
to	1
eat	1
any	1
thing;	1
and	1
Elinor's	1
attention	1
was	1
then	1
all	1
employed,	1
not	1
in	1
urging	1
her,	1
not	1
in	1
pitying	1
her,	1
nor	1
in	1
appearing	1
to	1
regard	1
her,	1
but	1
in	1
endeavouring	1
to	1
engage	1
Mrs.	1
Jenning's	1
notice	1
entirely	1
to	1
herself.	1
As	1
this	1
was	1
a	1
favourite	1
meal	1
with	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings,	1
it	1
lasted	1
a	1
considerable	1
time,	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
just	1
setting	1
themselves,	1
after	1
it,	1
round	1
the	1
common	1
working	1
table,	1
when	1
a	1
letter	1
was	1
delivered	1
to	1
Marianne,	1
which	1
she	1
eagerly	1
caught	1
from	1
the	1
servant,	1
and,	1
turning	1
of	1
a	1
death-like	1
paleness,	1
instantly	1
ran	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room.	1
Elinor,	1
who	1
saw	1
as	1
plainly	1
by	1
this,	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
seen	1
the	1
direction,	1
that	1
it	1
must	1
come	1
from	1
Willoughby,	1
felt	1
immediately	1
such	1
a	1
sickness	1
at	1
heart	1
as	1
made	1
her	1
hardly	1
able	1
to	1
hold	1
up	1
her	1
head,	1
and	1
sat	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
general	1
tremour	1
as	1
made	1
her	1
fear	1
it	1
impossible	1
to	1
escape	1
Mrs.	1
Jenning's	1
notice.	1
That	1
good	1
lady,	1
however,	1
saw	1
only	1
that	1
Marianne	1
had	1
received	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
Willoughby,	1
which	1
appeared	1
to	1
her	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
joke,	1
and	1
which	1
she	1
treated	1
accordingly,	1
by	1
hoping,	1
with	1
a	1
laugh,	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
find	1
it	1
to	1
her	1
liking.	1
Of	1
Elinor's	1
distress,	1
she	1
was	1
too	1
busily	1
employed	1
in	1
measuring	1
lengths	1
of	1
worsted	1
for	1
her	1
rug,	1
to	1
see	1
any	1
thing	1
at	1
all;	1
and	1
calmly	1
continuing	1
her	1
talk,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
Marianne	1
disappeared,	1
she	1
said,	1
"Upon	1
my	1
word,	1
I	1
never	1
saw	1
a	1
young	1
woman	1
so	1
desperately	1
in	1
love	1
in	1
my	1
life!	1
MY	1
girls	1
were	1
nothing	1
to	1
her,	1
and	1
yet	1
they	1
used	1
to	1
be	1
foolish	1
enough;	1
but	1
as	1
for	1
Miss	1
Marianne,	1
she	1
is	1
quite	1
an	1
altered	1
creature.	1
I	1
hope,	1
from	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
my	1
heart,	1
he	1
won't	1
keep	1
her	1
waiting	1
much	1
longer,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
quite	1
grievous	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
look	1
so	1
ill	1
and	1
forlorn.	1
Pray,	1
when	1
are	1
they	1
to	1
be	1
married?"	1
Elinor,	1
though	1
never	1
less	1
disposed	1
to	1
speak	1
than	1
at	1
that	1
moment,	1
obliged	1
herself	1
to	1
answer	1
such	1
an	1
attack	1
as	1
this,	1
and,	1
therefore,	1
trying	1
to	1
smile,	1
replied,	1
"And	1
have	1
you	1
really,	1
Ma'am,	1
talked	1
yourself	1
into	1
a	1
persuasion	1
of	1
my	1
sister's	1
being	1
engaged	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Willoughby?	1
I	1
thought	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
only	1
a	1
joke,	1
but	1
so	1
serious	1
a	1
question	1
seems	1
to	1
imply	1
more;	1
and	1
I	1
must	1
beg,	1
therefore,	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
deceive	1
yourself	1
any	1
longer.	1
I	1
do	1
assure	1
you	1
that	1
nothing	1
would	1
surprise	1
me	1
more	1
than	1
to	1
hear	1
of	1
their	1
being	1
going	1
to	1
be	1
married."	1
"For	1
shame,	1
for	1
shame,	1
Miss	1
Dashwood!	1
how	1
can	1
you	1
talk	1
so?	1
Don't	1
we	1
all	1
know	1
that	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
match,	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
over	1
head	1
and	1
ears	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
each	1
other	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
moment	1
they	1
met?	1
Did	1
not	1
I	1
see	1
them	1
together	1
in	1
Devonshire	1
every	1
day,	1
and	1
all	1
day	1
long;	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
your	1
sister	1
came	1
to	1
town	1
with	1
me	1
on	1
purpose	1
to	1
buy	1
wedding	1
clothes?	1
Come,	1
come,	1
this	1
won't	1
do.	1
Because	1
you	1
are	1
so	1
sly	1
about	1
it	1
yourself,	1
you	1
think	1
nobody	1
else	1
has	1
any	1
senses;	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
such	1
thing,	1
I	1
can	1
tell	1
you,	1
for	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
known	1
all	1
over	1
town	1
this	1
ever	1
so	1
long.	1
I	1
tell	1
every	1
body	1
of	1
it	1
and	1
so	1
does	1
Charlotte."	1
"Indeed,	1
Ma'am,"	1
said	1
Elinor,	1
very	1
seriously,	1
"you	1
are	1
mistaken.	1
Indeed,	1
you	1
are	1
doing	1
a	1
very	1
unkind	1
thing	1
in	1
spreading	1
the	1
report,	1
and	1
you	1
will	1
find	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
though	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
believe	1
me	1
now."	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
laughed	1
again,	1
but	1
Elinor	1
had	1
not	1
spirits	1
to	1
say	1
more,	1
and	1
eager	1
at	1
all	1
events	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
Willoughby	1
had	1
written,	1
hurried	1
away	1
to	1
their	1
room,	1
where,	1
on	1
opening	1
the	1
door,	1
she	1
saw	1
Marianne	1
stretched	1
on	1
the	1
bed,	1
almost	1
choked	1
by	1
grief,	1
one	1
letter	1
in	1
her	1
hand,	1
and	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
others	1
laying	1
by	1
her.	1
Elinor	1
drew	1
near,	1
but	1
without	1
saying	1
a	1
word;	1
and	1
seating	1
herself	1
on	1
the	1
bed,	1
took	1
her	1
hand,	1
kissed	1
her	1
affectionately	1
several	1
times,	1
and	1
then	1
gave	1
way	1
to	1
a	1
burst	1
of	1
tears,	1
which	1
at	1
first	1
was	1
scarcely	1
less	1
violent	1
than	1
Marianne's.	1
The	1
latter,	1
though	1
unable	1
to	1
speak,	1
seemed	1
to	1
feel	1
all	1
the	1
tenderness	1
of	1
this	1
behaviour,	1
and	1
after	1
some	1
time	1
thus	1
spent	1
in	1
joint	1
affliction,	1
she	1
put	1
all	1
the	1
letters	1
into	1
Elinor's	1
hands;	1
and	1
then	1
covering	1
her	1
face	1
with	1
her	1
handkerchief,	1
almost	1
screamed	1
with	1
agony.	1
Elinor,	1
who	1
knew	1
that	1
such	1
grief,	1
shocking	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
witness	1
it,	1
must	1
have	1
its	1
course,	1
watched	1
by	1
her	1
till	1
this	1
excess	1
of	1
suffering	1
had	1
somewhat	1
spent	1
itself,	1
and	1
then	1
turning	1
eagerly	1
to	1
Willoughby's	1
letter,	1
read	1
as	1
follows:	1
"Bond	1
Street,	1
January.	1
"MY	1
DEAR	1
MADAM,	1
"I	1
have	1
just	1
had	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
receiving	1
your	1
letter,	1
for	1
which	1
I	1
beg	1
to	1
return	1
my	1
sincere	1
acknowledgments.	1
I	1
am	1
much	1
concerned	1
to	1
find	1
there	1
was	1
anything	1
in	1
my	1
behaviour	1
last	1
night	1
that	1
did	1
not	1
meet	1
your	1
approbation;	1
and	1
though	1
I	1
am	1
quite	1
at	1
a	1
loss	1
to	1
discover	1
in	1
what	1
point	1
I	1
could	1
be	1
so	1
unfortunate	1
as	1
to	1
offend	1
you,	1
I	1
entreat	1
your	1
forgiveness	1
of	1
what	1
I	1
can	1
assure	1
you	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
perfectly	1
unintentional.	1
I	1
shall	1
never	1
reflect	1
on	1
my	1
former	1
acquaintance	1
with	1
your	1
family	1
in	1
Devonshire	1
without	1
the	1
most	1
grateful	1
pleasure,	1
and	1
flatter	1
myself	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
broken	1
by	1
any	1
mistake	1
or	1
misapprehension	1
of	1
my	1
actions.	1
My	1
esteem	1
for	1
your	1
whole	1
family	1
is	1
very	1
sincere;	1
but	1
if	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
so	1
unfortunate	1
as	1
to	1
give	1
rise	1
to	1
a	1
belief	1
of	1
more	1
than	1
I	1
felt,	1
or	1
meant	1
to	1
express,	1
I	1
shall	1
reproach	1
myself	1
for	1
not	1
having	1
been	1
more	1
guarded	1
in	1
my	1
professions	1
of	1
that	1
esteem.	1
That	1
I	1
should	1
ever	1
have	1
meant	1
more	1
you	1
will	1
allow	1
to	1
be	1
impossible,	1
when	1
you	1
understand	1
that	1
my	1
affections	1
have	1
been	1
long	1
engaged	1
elsewhere,	1
and	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
many	1
weeks,	1
I	1
believe,	1
before	1
this	1
engagement	1
is	1
fulfilled.	1
It	1
is	1
with	1
great	1
regret	1
that	1
I	1
obey	1
your	1
commands	1
in	1
returning	1
the	1
letters	1
with	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
honoured	1
from	1
you,	1
and	1
the	1
lock	1
of	1
hair,	1
which	1
you	1
so	1
obligingly	1
bestowed	1
on	1
me.	1
"I	1
am,	1
dear	1
Madam,	1
"Your	1
most	1
obedient	1
"humble	1
servant,	1
"JOHN	1
WILLOUGHBY."	1
With	1
what	1
indignation	1
such	1
a	1
letter	1
as	1
this	1
must	1
be	1
read	1
by	1
Miss	1
Dashwood,	1
may	1
be	1
imagined.	1
Though	1
aware,	1
before	1
she	1
began	1
it,	1
that	1
it	1
must	1
bring	1
a	1
confession	1
of	1
his	1
inconstancy,	1
and	1
confirm	1
their	1
separation	1
for	1
ever,	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
aware	1
that	1
such	1
language	1
could	1
be	1
suffered	1
to	1
announce	1
it;	1
nor	1
could	1
she	1
have	1
supposed	1
Willoughby	1
capable	1
of	1
departing	1
so	1
far	1
from	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
every	1
honourable	1
and	1
delicate	1
feeling--so	1
far	1
from	1
the	1
common	1
decorum	1
of	1
a	1
gentleman,	1
as	1
to	1
send	1
a	1
letter	1
so	1
impudently	1
cruel:	1
a	1
letter	1
which,	1
instead	1
of	1
bringing	1
with	1
his	1
desire	1
of	1
a	1
release	1
any	1
professions	1
of	1
regret,	1
acknowledged	1
no	1
breach	1
of	1
faith,	1
denied	1
all	1
peculiar	1
affection	1
whatever--	1
a	1
letter	1
of	1
which	1
every	1
line	1
was	1
an	1
insult,	1
and	1
which	1
proclaimed	1
its	1
writer	1
to	1
be	1
deep	1
in	1
hardened	1
villainy.	1
She	1
paused	1
over	1
it	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
with	1
indignant	1
astonishment;	1
then	1
read	1
it	1
again	1
and	1
again;	1
but	1
every	1
perusal	1
only	1
served	1
to	1
increase	1
her	1
abhorrence	1
of	1
the	1
man,	1
and	1
so	1
bitter	1
were	1
her	1
feelings	1
against	1
him,	1
that	1
she	1
dared	1
not	1
trust	1
herself	1
to	1
speak,	1
lest	1
she	1
might	1
wound	1
Marianne	1
still	1
deeper	1
by	1
treating	1
their	1
disengagement,	1
not	1
as	1
a	1
loss	1
to	1
her	1
of	1
any	1
possible	1
good	1
but	1
as	1
an	1
escape	1
from	1
the	1
worst	1
and	1
most	1
irremediable	1
of	1
all	1
evils,	1
a	1
connection,	1
for	1
life,	1
with	1
an	1
unprincipled	1
man,	1
as	1
a	1
deliverance	1
the	1
most	1
real,	1
a	1
blessing	1
the	1
most	1
important.	1
In	1
her	1
earnest	1
meditations	1
on	1
the	1
contents	1
of	1
the	1
letter,	1
on	1
the	1
depravity	1
of	1
that	1
mind	1
which	1
could	1
dictate	1
it,	1
and	1
probably,	1
on	1
the	1
very	1
different	1
mind	1
of	1
a	1
very	1
different	1
person,	1
who	1
had	1
no	1
other	1
connection	1
whatever	1
with	1
the	1
affair	1
than	1
what	1
her	1
heart	1
gave	1
him	1
with	1
every	1
thing	1
that	1
passed,	1
Elinor	1
forgot	1
the	1
immediate	1
distress	1
of	1
her	1
sister,	1
forgot	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
three	1
letters	1
on	1
her	1
lap	1
yet	1
unread,	1
and	1
so	1
entirely	1
forgot	1
how	1
long	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
room,	1
that	1
when	1
on	1
hearing	1
a	1
carriage	1
drive	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
door,	1
she	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
window	1
to	1
see	1
who	1
could	1
be	1
coming	1
so	1
unreasonably	1
early,	1
she	1
was	1
all	1
astonishment	1
to	1
perceive	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings's	1
chariot,	1
which	1
she	1
knew	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
ordered	1
till	1
one.	1
Determined	1
not	1
to	1
quit	1
Marianne,	1
though	1
hopeless	1
of	1
contributing,	1
at	1
present,	1
to	1
her	1
ease,	1
she	1
hurried	1
away	1
to	1
excuse	1
herself	1
from	1
attending	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings,	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
her	1
sister	1
being	1
indisposed.	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings,	1
with	1
a	1
thoroughly	1
good-humoured	1
concern	1
for	1
its	1
cause,	1
admitted	1
the	1
excuse	1
most	1
readily,	1
and	1
Elinor,	1
after	1
seeing	1
her	1
safe	1
off,	1
returned	1
to	1
Marianne,	1
whom	1
she	1
found	1
attempting	1
to	1
rise	1
from	1
the	1
bed,	1
and	1
whom	1
she	1
reached	1
just	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
prevent	1
her	1
from	1
falling	1
on	1
the	1
floor,	1
faint	1
and	1
giddy	1
from	1
a	1
long	1
want	1
of	1
proper	1
rest	1
and	1
food;	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
many	1
days	1
since	1
she	1
had	1
any	1
appetite,	1
and	1
many	1
nights	1
since	1
she	1
had	1
really	1
slept;	1
and	1
now,	1
when	1
her	1
mind	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
supported	1
by	1
the	1
fever	1
of	1
suspense,	1
the	1
consequence	1
of	1
all	1
this	1
was	1
felt	1
in	1
an	1
aching	1
head,	1
a	1
weakened	1
stomach,	1
and	1
a	1
general	1
nervous	1
faintness.	1
A	1
glass	1
of	1
wine,	1
which	1
Elinor	1
procured	1
for	1
her	1
directly,	1
made	1
her	1
more	1
comfortable,	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
at	1
last	1
able	1
to	1
express	1
some	1
sense	1
of	1
her	1
kindness,	1
by	1
saying,	1
"Poor	1
Elinor!	1
how	1
unhappy	1
I	1
make	1
you!"	1
"I	1
only	1
wish,"	1
replied	1
her	1
sister,	1
"there	1
were	1
any	1
thing	1
I	1
COULD	1
do,	1
which	1
might	1
be	1
of	1
comfort	1
to	1
you."	1
This,	1
as	1
every	1
thing	1
else	1
would	1
have	1
been,	1
was	1
too	1
much	1
for	1
Marianne,	1
who	1
could	1
only	1
exclaim,	1
in	1
the	1
anguish	1
of	1
her	1
heart,	1
"Oh!	1
Elinor,	1
I	1
am	1
miserable,	1
indeed,"	1
before	1
her	1
voice	1
was	1
entirely	1
lost	1
in	1
sobs.	1
Elinor	1
could	1
no	1
longer	1
witness	1
this	1
torrent	1
of	1
unresisted	1
grief	1
in	1
silence.	1
"Exert	1
yourself,	1
dear	1
Marianne,"	1
she	1
cried,	1
"if	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
kill	1
yourself	1
and	1
all	1
who	1
love	1
you.	1
Think	1
of	1
your	1
mother;	1
think	1
of	1
her	1
misery	1
while	1
YOU	1
suffer:	1
for	1
her	1
sake	1
you	1
must	1
exert	1
yourself."	1
"I	1
cannot,	1
I	1
cannot,"	1
cried	1
Marianne;	1
"leave	1
me,	1
leave	1
me,	1
if	1
I	1
distress	1
you;	1
leave	1
me,	1
hate	1
me,	1
forget	1
me!	1
but	1
do	1
not	1
torture	1
me	1
so.	1
Oh!	1
how	1
easy	1
for	1
those,	1
who	1
have	1
no	1
sorrow	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
to	1
talk	1
of	1
exertion!	1
Happy,	1
happy	1
Elinor,	1
YOU	1
cannot	1
have	1
an	1
idea	1
of	1
what	1
I	1
suffer."	1
"Do	1
you	1
call	1
ME	1
happy,	1
Marianne?	1
Ah!	1
if	1
you	1
knew!--And	1
can	1
you	1
believe	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
so,	1
while	1
I	1
see	1
you	1
so	1
wretched!"	1
"Forgive	1
me,	1
forgive	1
me,"	1
throwing	1
her	1
arms	1
round	1
her	1
sister's	1
neck;	1
"I	1
know	1
you	1
feel	1
for	1
me;	1
I	1
know	1
what	1
a	1
heart	1
you	1
have;	1
but	1
yet	1
you	1
are--you	1
must	1
be	1
happy;	1
Edward	1
loves	1
you--what,	1
oh	1
what,	1
can	1
do	1
away	1
such	1
happiness	1
as	1
that?"	1
"Many,	1
many	1
circumstances,"	1
said	1
Elinor,	1
solemnly.	1
"No,	1
no,	1
no,"	1
cried	1
Marianne	1
wildly,	1
"he	1
loves	1
you,	1
and	1
only	1
you.	1
You	1
CAN	1
have	1
no	1
grief."	1
"I	1
can	1
have	1
no	1
pleasure	1
while	1
I	1
see	1
you	1
in	1
this	1
state."	1
"And	1
you	1
will	1
never	1
see	1
me	1
otherwise.	1
Mine	1
is	1
a	1
misery	1
which	1
nothing	1
can	1
do	1
away."	1
"You	1
must	1
not	1
talk	1
so,	1
Marianne.	1
Have	1
you	1
no	1
comforts?	1
no	1
friends?	1
Is	1
your	1
loss	1
such	1
as	1
leaves	1
no	1
opening	1
for	1
consolation?	1
Much	1
as	1
you	1
suffer	1
now,	1
think	1
of	1
what	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
suffered	1
if	1
the	1
discovery	1
of	1
his	1
character	1
had	1
been	1
delayed	1
to	1
a	1
later	1
period--	1
if	1
your	1
engagement	1
had	1
been	1
carried	1
on	1
for	1
months	1
and	1
months,	1
as	1
it	1
might	1
have	1
been,	1
before	1
he	1
chose	1
to	1
put	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
it.	1
Every	1
additional	1
day	1
of	1
unhappy	1
confidence,	1
on	1
your	1
side,	1
would	1
have	1
made	1
the	1
blow	1
more	1
dreadful."	1
"Engagement!"	1
cried	1
Marianne,	1
"there	1
has	1
been	1
no	1
engagement."	1
"No	1
engagement!"	1
"No,	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
so	1
unworthy	1
as	1
you	1
believe	1
him.	1
He	1
has	1
broken	1
no	1
faith	1
with	1
me."	1
"But	1
he	1
told	1
you	1
that	1
he	1
loved	1
you."	1
"Yes--no--never	1
absolutely.	1
It	1
was	1
every	1
day	1
implied,	1
but	1
never	1
professedly	1
declared.	1
Sometimes	1
I	1
thought	1
it	1
had	1
been--but	1
it	1
never	1
was."	1
"Yet	1
you	1
wrote	1
to	1
him?"--	1
"Yes--could	1
that	1
be	1
wrong	1
after	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
passed?--	1
But	1
I	1
cannot	1
talk."	1
Elinor	1
said	1
no	1
more,	1
and	1
turning	1
again	1
to	1
the	1
three	1
letters	1
which	1
now	1
raised	1
a	1
much	1
stronger	1
curiosity	1
than	1
before,	1
directly	1
ran	1
over	1
the	1
contents	1
of	1
all.	1
The	1
first,	1
which	1
was	1
what	1
her	1
sister	1
had	1
sent	1
him	1
on	1
their	1
arrival	1
in	1
town,	1
was	1
to	1
this	1
effect.	1
Berkeley	1
Street,	1
January.	1
"How	1
surprised	1
you	1
will	1
be,	1
Willoughby,	1
on	1
receiving	1
this;	1
and	1
I	1
think	1
you	1
will	1
feel	1
something	1
more	1
than	1
surprise,	1
when	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
town.	1
An	1
opportunity	1
of	1
coming	1
hither,	1
though	1
with	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings,	1
was	1
a	1
temptation	1
we	1
could	1
not	1
resist.	1
I	1
wish	1
you	1
may	1
receive	1
this	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
come	1
here	1
to-night,	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
depend	1
on	1
it.	1
At	1
any	1
rate	1
I	1
shall	1
expect	1
you	1
to-morrow.	1
For	1
the	1
present,	1
adieu.	1
"M.D."	1
Her	1
second	1
note,	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
written	1
on	1
the	1
morning	1
after	1
the	1
dance	1
at	1
the	1
Middletons',	1
was	1
in	1
these	1
words:--	1
"I	1
cannot	1
express	1
my	1
disappointment	1
in	1
having	1
missed	1
you	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
yesterday,	1
nor	1
my	1
astonishment	1
at	1
not	1
having	1
received	1
any	1
answer	1
to	1
a	1
note	1
which	1
I	1
sent	1
you	1
above	1
a	1
week	1
ago.	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
expecting	1
to	1
hear	1
from	1
you,	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
to	1
see	1
you,	1
every	1
hour	1
of	1
the	1
day.	1
Pray	1
call	1
again	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
possible,	1
and	1
explain	1
the	1
reason	1
of	1
my	1
having	1
expected	1
this	1
in	1
vain.	1
You	1
had	1
better	1
come	1
earlier	1
another	1
time,	1
because	1
we	1
are	1
generally	1
out	1
by	1
one.	1
We	1
were	1
last	1
night	1
at	1
Lady	1
Middleton's,	1
where	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
dance.	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
told	1
that	1
you	1
were	1
asked	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
the	1
party.	1
But	1
could	1
it	1
be	1
so?	1
You	1
must	1
be	1
very	1
much	1
altered	1
indeed	1
since	1
we	1
parted,	1
if	1
that	1
could	1
be	1
the	1
case,	1
and	1
you	1
not	1
there.	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
suppose	1
this	1
possible,	1
and	1
I	1
hope	1
very	1
soon	1
to	1
receive	1
your	1
personal	1
assurance	1
of	1
its	1
being	1
otherwise.	1
"M.D."	1
The	1
contents	1
of	1
her	1
last	1
note	1
to	1
him	1
were	1
these:--	1
"What	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
imagine,	1
Willoughby,	1
by	1
your	1
behaviour	1
last	1
night?	1
Again	1
I	1
demand	1
an	1
explanation	1
of	1
it.	1
I	1
was	1
prepared	1
to	1
meet	1
you	1
with	1
the	1
pleasure	1
which	1
our	1
separation	1
naturally	1
produced,	1
with	1
the	1
familiarity	1
which	1
our	1
intimacy	1
at	1
Barton	1
appeared	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
justify.	1
I	1
was	1
repulsed	1
indeed!	1
I	1
have	1
passed	1
a	1
wretched	1
night	1
in	1
endeavouring	1
to	1
excuse	1
a	1
conduct	1
which	1
can	1
scarcely	1
be	1
called	1
less	1
than	1
insulting;	1
but	1
though	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
yet	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
form	1
any	1
reasonable	1
apology	1
for	1
your	1
behaviour,	1
I	1
am	1
perfectly	1
ready	1
to	1
hear	1
your	1
justification	1
of	1
it.	1
You	1
have	1
perhaps	1
been	1
misinformed,	1
or	1
purposely	1
deceived,	1
in	1
something	1
concerning	1
me,	1
which	1
may	1
have	1
lowered	1
me	1
in	1
your	1
opinion.	1
Tell	1
me	1
what	1
it	1
is,	1
explain	1
the	1
grounds	1
on	1
which	1
you	1
acted,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
satisfied,	1
in	1
being	1
able	1
to	1
satisfy	1
you.	1
It	1
would	1
grieve	1
me	1
indeed	1
to	1
be	1
obliged	1
to	1
think	1
ill	1
of	1
you;	1
but	1
if	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
do	1
it,	1
if	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
learn	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
what	1
we	1
have	1
hitherto	1
believed	1
you,	1
that	1
your	1
regard	1
for	1
us	1
all	1
was	1
insincere,	1
that	1
your	1
behaviour	1
to	1
me	1
was	1
intended	1
only	1
to	1
deceive,	1
let	1
it	1
be	1
told	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
possible.	1
My	1
feelings	1
are	1
at	1
present	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
dreadful	1
indecision;	1
I	1
wish	1
to	1
acquit	1
you,	1
but	1
certainty	1
on	1
either	1
side	1
will	1
be	1
ease	1
to	1
what	1
I	1
now	1
suffer.	1
If	1
your	1
sentiments	1
are	1
no	1
longer	1
what	1
they	1
were,	1
you	1
will	1
return	1
my	1
notes,	1
and	1
the	1
lock	1
of	1
my	1
hair	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
your	1
possession.	1
"M.D."	1
That	1
such	1
letters,	1
so	1
full	1
of	1
affection	1
and	1
confidence,	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
so	1
answered,	1
Elinor,	1
for	1
Willoughby's	1
sake,	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
unwilling	1
to	1
believe.	1
But	1
her	1
condemnation	1
of	1
him	1
did	1
not	1
blind	1
her	1
to	1
the	1
impropriety	1
of	1
their	1
having	1
been	1
written	1
at	1
all;	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
silently	1
grieving	1
over	1
the	1
imprudence	1
which	1
had	1
hazarded	1
such	1
unsolicited	1
proofs	1
of	1
tenderness,	1
not	1
warranted	1
by	1
anything	1
preceding,	1
and	1
most	1
severely	1
condemned	1
by	1
the	1
event,	1
when	1
Marianne,	1
perceiving	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
finished	1
the	1
letters,	1
observed	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
they	1
contained	1
nothing	1
but	1
what	1
any	1
one	1
would	1
have	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
situation.	1
"I	1
felt	1
myself,"	1
she	1
added,	1
"to	1
be	1
as	1
solemnly	1
engaged	1
to	1
him,	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
strictest	1
legal	1
covenant	1
had	1
bound	1
us	1
to	1
each	1
other."	1
"I	1
can	1
believe	1
it,"	1
said	1
Elinor;	1
"but	1
unfortunately	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
feel	1
the	1
same."	1
"He	1
DID	1
feel	1
the	1
same,	1
Elinor--for	1
weeks	1
and	1
weeks	1
he	1
felt	1
it.	1
I	1
know	1
he	1
did.	1
Whatever	1
may	1
have	1
changed	1
him	1
now,	1
(and	1
nothing	1
but	1
the	1
blackest	1
art	1
employed	1
against	1
me	1
can	1
have	1
done	1
it),	1
I	1
was	1
once	1
as	1
dear	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
my	1
own	1
soul	1
could	1
wish.	1
This	1
lock	1
of	1
hair,	1
which	1
now	1
he	1
can	1
so	1
readily	1
give	1
up,	1
was	1
begged	1
of	1
me	1
with	1
the	1
most	1
earnest	1
supplication.	1
Had	1
you	1
seen	1
his	1
look,	1
his	1
manner,	1
had	1
you	1
heard	1
his	1
voice	1
at	1
that	1
moment!	1
Have	1
you	1
forgot	1
the	1
last	1
evening	1
of	1
our	1
being	1
together	1
at	1
Barton?	1
The	1
morning	1
that	1
we	1
parted	1
too!	1
When	1
he	1
told	1
me	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
many	1
weeks	1
before	1
we	1
met	1
again--his	1
distress--can	1
I	1
ever	1
forget	1
his	1
distress?"	1
For	1
a	1
moment	1
or	1
two	1
she	1
could	1
say	1
no	1
more;	1
but	1
when	1
this	1
emotion	1
had	1
passed	1
away,	1
she	1
added,	1
in	1
a	1
firmer	1
tone,	1
"Elinor,	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
cruelly	1
used;	1
but	1
not	1
by	1
Willoughby."	1
"Dearest	1
Marianne,	1
who	1
but	1
himself?	1
By	1
whom	1
can	1
he	1
have	1
been	1
instigated?"	1
"By	1
all	1
the	1
world,	1
rather	1
than	1
by	1
his	1
own	1
heart.	1
I	1
could	1
rather	1
believe	1
every	1
creature	1
of	1
my	1
acquaintance	1
leagued	1
together	1
to	1
ruin	1
me	1
in	1
his	1
opinion,	1
than	1
believe	1
his	1
nature	1
capable	1
of	1
such	1
cruelty.	1
This	1
woman	1
of	1
whom	1
he	1
writes--whoever	1
she	1
be--or	1
any	1
one,	1
in	1
short,	1
but	1
your	1
own	1
dear	1
self,	1
mama,	1
and	1
Edward,	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
so	1
barbarous	1
to	1
bely	1
me.	1
Beyond	1
you	1
three,	1
is	1
there	1
a	1
creature	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
whom	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
rather	1
suspect	1
of	1
evil	1
than	1
Willoughby,	1
whose	1
heart	1
I	1
know	1
so	1
well?"	1
Elinor	1
would	1
not	1
contend,	1
and	1
only	1
replied,	1
"Whoever	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
so	1
detestably	1
your	1
enemy,	1
let	1
them	1
be	1
cheated	1
of	1
their	1
malignant	1
triumph,	1
my	1
dear	1
sister,	1
by	1
seeing	1
how	1
nobly	1
the	1
consciousness	1
of	1
your	1
own	1
innocence	1
and	1
good	1
intentions	1
supports	1
your	1
spirits.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
reasonable	1
and	1
laudable	1
pride	1
which	1
resists	1
such	1
malevolence."	1
"No,	1
no,"	1
cried	1
Marianne,	1
"misery	1
such	1
as	1
mine	1
has	1
no	1
pride.	1
I	1
care	1
not	1
who	1
knows	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
wretched.	1
The	1
triumph	1
of	1
seeing	1
me	1
so	1
may	1
be	1
open	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
world.	1
Elinor,	1
Elinor,	1
they	1
who	1
suffer	1
little	1
may	1
be	1
proud	1
and	1
independent	1
as	1
they	1
like--may	1
resist	1
insult,	1
or	1
return	1
mortification--but	1
I	1
cannot.	1
I	1
must	1
feel--I	1
must	1
be	1
wretched--and	1
they	1
are	1
welcome	1
to	1
enjoy	1
the	1
consciousness	1
of	1
it	1
that	1
can."	1
"But	1
for	1
my	1
mother's	1
sake	1
and	1
mine--"	1
"I	1
would	1
do	1
more	1
than	1
for	1
my	1
own.	1
But	1
to	1
appear	1
happy	1
when	1
I	1
am	1
so	1
miserable--Oh!	1
who	1
can	1
require	1
it?"	1
Again	1
they	1
were	1
both	1
silent.	1
Elinor	1
was	1
employed	1
in	1
walking	1
thoughtfully	1
from	1
the	1
fire	1
to	1
the	1
window,	1
from	1
the	1
window	1
to	1
the	1
fire,	1
without	1
knowing	1
that	1
she	1
received	1
warmth	1
from	1
one,	1
or	1
discerning	1
objects	1
through	1
the	1
other;	1
and	1
Marianne,	1
seated	1
at	1
the	1
foot	1
of	1
the	1
bed,	1
with	1
her	1
head	1
leaning	1
against	1
one	1
of	1
its	1
posts,	1
again	1
took	1
up	1
Willoughby's	1
letter,	1
and,	1
after	1
shuddering	1
over	1
every	1
sentence,	1
exclaimed--	1
"It	1
is	1
too	1
much!	1
Oh,	1
Willoughby,	1
Willoughby,	1
could	1
this	1
be	1
yours!	1
Cruel,	1
cruel--nothing	1
can	1
acquit	1
you.	1
Elinor,	1
nothing	1
can.	1
Whatever	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
heard	1
against	1
me--	1
ought	1
he	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
suspended	1
his	1
belief?	1
ought	1
he	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
told	1
me	1
of	1
it,	1
to	1
have	1
given	1
me	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
clearing	1
myself?	1
'The	1
lock	1
of	1
hair,	1
(repeating	1
it	1
from	1
the	1
letter,)	1
which	1
you	1
so	1
obligingly	1
bestowed	1
on	1
me'--That	1
is	1
unpardonable.	1
Willoughby,	1
where	1
was	1
your	1
heart	1
when	1
you	1
wrote	1
those	1
words?	1
Oh,	1
barbarously	1
insolent!--Elinor,	1
can	1
he	1
be	1
justified?"	1
"No,	1
Marianne,	1
in	1
no	1
possible	1
way."	1
"And	1
yet	1
this	1
woman--who	1
knows	1
what	1
her	1
art	1
may	1
have	1
been?--how	1
long	1
it	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
premeditated,	1
and	1
how	1
deeply	1
contrived	1
by	1
her!--Who	1
is	1
she?--Who	1
can	1
she	1
be?--Whom	1
did	1
I	1
ever	1
hear	1
him	1
talk	1
of	1
as	1
young	1
and	1
attractive	1
among	1
his	1
female	1
acquaintance?--Oh!	1
no	1
one,	1
no	1
one--he	1
talked	1
to	1
me	1
only	1
of	1
myself."	1
Another	1
pause	1
ensued;	1
Marianne	1
was	1
greatly	1
agitated,	1
and	1
it	1
ended	1
thus.	1
"Elinor,	1
I	1
must	1
go	1
home.	1
I	1
must	1
go	1
and	1
comfort	1
mama.	1
Can	1
not	1
we	1
be	1
gone	1
to-morrow?"	1
"To-morrow,	1
Marianne!"	1
"Yes,	1
why	1
should	1
I	1
stay	1
here?	1
I	1
came	1
only	1
for	1
Willoughby's	1
sake--and	1
now	1
who	1
cares	1
for	1
me?	1
Who	1
regards	1
me?"	1
"It	1
would	1
be	1
impossible	1
to	1
go	1
to-morrow.	1
We	1
owe	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
much	1
more	1
than	1
civility;	1
and	1
civility	1
of	1
the	1
commonest	1
kind	1
must	1
prevent	1
such	1
a	1
hasty	1
removal	1
as	1
that."	1
"Well	1
then,	1
another	1
day	1
or	1
two,	1
perhaps;	1
but	1
I	1
cannot	1
stay	1
here	1
long,	1
I	1
cannot	1
stay	1
to	1
endure	1
the	1
questions	1
and	1
remarks	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
people.	1
The	1
Middletons	1
and	1
Palmers--how	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
bear	1
their	1
pity?	1
The	1
pity	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
woman	1
as	1
Lady	1
Middleton!	1
Oh,	1
what	1
would	1
HE	1
say	1
to	1
that!"	1
Elinor	1
advised	1
her	1
to	1
lie	1
down	1
again,	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
she	1
did	1
so;	1
but	1
no	1
attitude	1
could	1
give	1
her	1
ease;	1
and	1
in	1
restless	1
pain	1
of	1
mind	1
and	1
body	1
she	1
moved	1
from	1
one	1
posture	1
to	1
another,	1
till	1
growing	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
hysterical,	1
her	1
sister	1
could	1
with	1
difficulty	1
keep	1
her	1
on	1
the	1
bed	1
at	1
all,	1
and	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
was	1
fearful	1
of	1
being	1
constrained	1
to	1
call	1
for	1
assistance.	1
Some	1
lavender	1
drops,	1
however,	1
which	1
she	1
was	1
at	1
length	1
persuaded	1
to	1
take,	1
were	1
of	1
use;	1
and	1
from	1
that	1
time	1
till	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
returned,	1
she	1
continued	1
on	1
the	1
bed	1
quiet	1
and	1
motionless.	1
CHAPTER	1
30	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
came	1
immediately	1
to	1
their	1
room	1
on	1
her	1
return,	1
and	1
without	1
waiting	1
to	1
have	1
her	1
request	1
of	1
admittance	1
answered,	1
opened	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
walked	1
in	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
real	1
concern.	1
"How	1
do	1
you	1
do	1
my	1
dear?"--said	1
she	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
of	1
great	1
compassion	1
to	1
Marianne,	1
who	1
turned	1
away	1
her	1
face	1
without	1
attempting	1
to	1
answer.	1
"How	1
is	1
she,	1
Miss	1
Dashwood?--Poor	1
thing!	1
she	1
looks	1
very	1
bad.--	1
No	1
wonder.	1
Ay,	1
it	1
is	1
but	1
too	1
true.	1
He	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
married	1
very	1
soon--a	1
good-for-nothing	1
fellow!	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
patience	1
with	1
him.	1
Mrs.	1
Taylor	1
told	1
me	1
of	1
it	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
ago,	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
told	1
it	1
by	1
a	1
particular	1
friend	1
of	1
Miss	1
Grey	1
herself,	1
else	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
believed	1
it;	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
almost	1
ready	1
to	1
sink	1
as	1
it	1
was.	1
Well,	1
said	1
I,	1
all	1
I	1
can	1
say	1
is,	1
that	1
if	1
this	1
be	1
true,	1
he	1
has	1
used	1
a	1
young	1
lady	1
of	1
my	1
acquaintance	1
abominably	1
ill,	1
and	1
I	1
wish	1
with	1
all	1
my	1
soul	1
his	1
wife	1
may	1
plague	1
his	1
heart	1
out.	1
And	1
so	1
I	1
shall	1
always	1
say,	1
my	1
dear,	1
you	1
may	1
depend	1
on	1
it.	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
notion	1
of	1
men's	1
going	1
on	1
in	1
this	1
way;	1
and	1
if	1
ever	1
I	1
meet	1
him	1
again,	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
him	1
such	1
a	1
dressing	1
as	1
he	1
has	1
not	1
had	1
this	1
many	1
a	1
day.	1
But	1
there	1
is	1
one	1
comfort,	1
my	1
dear	1
Miss	1
Marianne;	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
only	1
young	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
worth	1
having;	1
and	1
with	1
your	1
pretty	1
face	1
you	1
will	1
never	1
want	1
admirers.	1
Well,	1
poor	1
thing!	1
I	1
won't	1
disturb	1
her	1
any	1
longer,	1
for	1
she	1
had	1
better	1
have	1
her	1
cry	1
out	1
at	1
once	1
and	1
have	1
done	1
with.	1
The	1
Parrys	1
and	1
Sandersons	1
luckily	1
are	1
coming	1
tonight	1
you	1
know,	1
and	1
that	1
will	1
amuse	1
her."	1
She	1
then	1
went	1
away,	1
walking	1
on	1
tiptoe	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room,	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
supposed	1
her	1
young	1
friend's	1
affliction	1
could	1
be	1
increased	1
by	1
noise.	1
Marianne,	1
to	1
the	1
surprise	1
of	1
her	1
sister,	1
determined	1
on	1
dining	1
with	1
them.	1
Elinor	1
even	1
advised	1
her	1
against	1
it.	1
But	1
"no,	1
she	1
would	1
go	1
down;	1
she	1
could	1
bear	1
it	1
very	1
well,	1
and	1
the	1
bustle	1
about	1
her	1
would	1
be	1
less."	1
Elinor,	1
pleased	1
to	1
have	1
her	1
governed	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
by	1
such	1
a	1
motive,	1
though	1
believing	1
it	1
hardly	1
possible	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
sit	1
out	1
the	1
dinner,	1
said	1
no	1
more;	1
and	1
adjusting	1
her	1
dress	1
for	1
her	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
she	1
could,	1
while	1
Marianne	1
still	1
remained	1
on	1
the	1
bed,	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
assist	1
her	1
into	1
the	1
dining	1
room	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
summoned	1
to	1
it.	1
When	1
there,	1
though	1
looking	1
most	1
wretchedly,	1
she	1
ate	1
more	1
and	1
was	1
calmer	1
than	1
her	1
sister	1
had	1
expected.	1
Had	1
she	1
tried	1
to	1
speak,	1
or	1
had	1
she	1
been	1
conscious	1
of	1
half	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings's	1
well-meant	1
but	1
ill-judged	1
attentions	1
to	1
her,	1
this	1
calmness	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
maintained;	1
but	1
not	1
a	1
syllable	1
escaped	1
her	1
lips;	1
and	1
the	1
abstraction	1
of	1
her	1
thoughts	1
preserved	1
her	1
in	1
ignorance	1
of	1
every	1
thing	1
that	1
was	1
passing	1
before	1
her.	1
Elinor,	1
who	1
did	1
justice	1
to	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings's	1
kindness,	1
though	1
its	1
effusions	1
were	1
often	1
distressing,	1
and	1
sometimes	1
almost	1
ridiculous,	1
made	1
her	1
those	1
acknowledgments,	1
and	1
returned	1
her	1
those	1
civilities,	1
which	1
her	1
sister	1
could	1
not	1
make	1
or	1
return	1
for	1
herself.	1
Their	1
good	1
friend	1
saw	1
that	1
Marianne	1
was	1
unhappy,	1
and	1
felt	1
that	1
every	1
thing	1
was	1
due	1
to	1
her	1
which	1
might	1
make	1
her	1
at	1
all	1
less	1
so.	1
She	1
treated	1
her	1
therefore,	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
indulgent	1
fondness	1
of	1
a	1
parent	1
towards	1
a	1
favourite	1
child	1
on	1
the	1
last	1
day	1
of	1
its	1
holidays.	1
Marianne	1
was	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
best	1
place	1
by	1
the	1
fire,	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
tempted	1
to	1
eat	1
by	1
every	1
delicacy	1
in	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
amused	1
by	1
the	1
relation	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
news	1
of	1
the	1
day.	1
Had	1
not	1
Elinor,	1
in	1
the	1
sad	1
countenance	1
of	1
her	1
sister,	1
seen	1
a	1
check	1
to	1
all	1
mirth,	1
she	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
entertained	1
by	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings's	1
endeavours	1
to	1
cure	1
a	1
disappointment	1
in	1
love,	1
by	1
a	1
variety	1
of	1
sweetmeats	1
and	1
olives,	1
and	1
a	1
good	1
fire.	1
As	1
soon,	1
however,	1
as	1
the	1
consciousness	1
of	1
all	1
this	1
was	1
forced	1
by	1
continual	1
repetition	1
on	1
Marianne,	1
she	1
could	1
stay	1
no	1
longer.	1
With	1
a	1
hasty	1
exclamation	1
of	1
Misery,	1
and	1
a	1
sign	1
to	1
her	1
sister	1
not	1
to	1
follow	1
her,	1
she	1
directly	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
hurried	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room.	1
"Poor	1
soul!"	1
cried	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
gone,	1
"how	1
it	1
grieves	1
me	1
to	1
see	1
her!	1
And	1
I	1
declare	1
if	1
she	1
is	1
not	1
gone	1
away	1
without	1
finishing	1
her	1
wine!	1
And	1
the	1
dried	1
cherries	1
too!	1
Lord!	1
nothing	1
seems	1
to	1
do	1
her	1
any	1
good.	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
if	1
I	1
knew	1
of	1
any	1
thing	1
she	1
would	1
like,	1
I	1
would	1
send	1
all	1
over	1
the	1
town	1
for	1
it.	1
Well,	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
oddest	1
thing	1
to	1
me,	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
should	1
use	1
such	1
a	1
pretty	1
girl	1
so	1
ill!	1
But	1
when	1
there	1
is	1
plenty	1
of	1
money	1
on	1
one	1
side,	1
and	1
next	1
to	1
none	1
on	1
the	1
other,	1
Lord	1
bless	1
you!	1
they	1
care	1
no	1
more	1
about	1
such	1
things!--"	1
"The	1
lady	1
then--Miss	1
Grey	1
I	1
think	1
you	1
called	1
her--	1
is	1
very	1
rich?"	1
"Fifty	1
thousand	1
pounds,	1
my	1
dear.	1
Did	1
you	1
ever	1
see	1
her?	1
a	1
smart,	1
stylish	1
girl	1
they	1
say,	1
but	1
not	1
handsome.	1
I	1
remember	1
her	1
aunt	1
very	1
well,	1
Biddy	1
Henshawe;	1
she	1
married	1
a	1
very	1
wealthy	1
man.	1
But	1
the	1
family	1
are	1
all	1
rich	1
together.	1
Fifty	1
thousand	1
pounds!	1
and	1
by	1
all	1
accounts,	1
it	1
won't	1
come	1
before	1
it's	1
wanted;	1
for	1
they	1
say	1
he	1
is	1
all	1
to	1
pieces.	1
No	1
wonder!	1
dashing	1
about	1
with	1
his	1
curricle	1
and	1
hunters!	1
Well,	1
it	1
don't	1
signify	1
talking;	1
but	1
when	1
a	1
young	1
man,	1
be	1
who	1
he	1
will,	1
comes	1
and	1
makes	1
love	1
to	1
a	1
pretty	1
girl,	1
and	1
promises	1
marriage,	1
he	1
has	1
no	1
business	1
to	1
fly	1
off	1
from	1
his	1
word	1
only	1
because	1
he	1
grows	1
poor,	1
and	1
a	1
richer	1
girl	1
is	1
ready	1
to	1
have	1
him.	1
Why	1
don't	1
he,	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
case,	1
sell	1
his	1
horses,	1
let	1
his	1
house,	1
turn	1
off	1
his	1
servants,	1
and	1
make	1
a	1
thorough	1
reform	1
at	1
once?	1
I	1
warrant	1
you,	1
Miss	1
Marianne	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
ready	1
to	1
wait	1
till	1
matters	1
came	1
round.	1
But	1
that	1
won't	1
do	1
now-a-days;	1
nothing	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
pleasure	1
can	1
ever	1
be	1
given	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
of	1
this	1
age."	1
"Do	1
you	1
know	1
what	1
kind	1
of	1
a	1
girl	1
Miss	1
Grey	1
is?	1
Is	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
be	1
amiable?"	1
"I	1
never	1
heard	1
any	1
harm	1
of	1
her;	1
indeed	1
I	1
hardly	1
ever	1
heard	1
her	1
mentioned;	1
except	1
that	1
Mrs.	1
Taylor	1
did	1
say	1
this	1
morning,	1
that	1
one	1
day	1
Miss	1
Walker	1
hinted	1
to	1
her,	1
that	1
she	1
believed	1
Mr.	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Ellison	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
sorry	1
to	1
have	1
Miss	1
Grey	1
married,	1
for	1
she	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Ellison	1
could	1
never	1
agree."--	1
"And	1
who	1
are	1
the	1
Ellisons?"	1
"Her	1
guardians,	1
my	1
dear.	1
But	1
now	1
she	1
is	1
of	1
age	1
and	1
may	1
choose	1
for	1
herself;	1
and	1
a	1
pretty	1
choice	1
she	1
has	1
made!--What	1
now,"	1
after	1
pausing	1
a	1
moment--"your	1
poor	1
sister	1
is	1
gone	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
room,	1
I	1
suppose,	1
to	1
moan	1
by	1
herself.	1
Is	1
there	1
nothing	1
one	1
can	1
get	1
to	1
comfort	1
her?	1
Poor	1
dear,	1
it	1
seems	1
quite	1
cruel	1
to	1
let	1
her	1
be	1
alone.	1
Well,	1
by-and-by	1
we	1
shall	1
have	1
a	1
few	1
friends,	1
and	1
that	1
will	1
amuse	1
her	1
a	1
little.	1
What	1
shall	1
we	1
play	1
at?	1
She	1
hates	1
whist	1
I	1
know;	1
but	1
is	1
there	1
no	1
round	1
game	1
she	1
cares	1
for?"	1
"Dear	1
ma'am,	1
this	1
kindness	1
is	1
quite	1
unnecessary.	1
Marianne,	1
I	1
dare	1
say,	1
will	1
not	1
leave	1
her	1
room	1
again	1
this	1
evening.	1
I	1
shall	1
persuade	1
her	1
if	1
I	1
can	1
to	1
go	1
early	1
to	1
bed,	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
she	1
wants	1
rest."	1
"Aye,	1
I	1
believe	1
that	1
will	1
be	1
best	1
for	1
her.	1
Let	1
her	1
name	1
her	1
own	1
supper,	1
and	1
go	1
to	1
bed.	1
Lord!	1
no	1
wonder	1
she	1
has	1
been	1
looking	1
so	1
bad	1
and	1
so	1
cast	1
down	1
this	1
last	1
week	1
or	1
two,	1
for	1
this	1
matter	1
I	1
suppose	1
has	1
been	1
hanging	1
over	1
her	1
head	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
that.	1
And	1
so	1
the	1
letter	1
that	1
came	1
today	1
finished	1
it!	1
Poor	1
soul!	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
had	1
a	1
notion	1
of	1
it,	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
joked	1
her	1
about	1
it	1
for	1
all	1
my	1
money.	1
But	1
then	1
you	1
know,	1
how	1
should	1
I	1
guess	1
such	1
a	1
thing?	1
I	1
made	1
sure	1
of	1
its	1
being	1
nothing	1
but	1
a	1
common	1
love	1
letter,	1
and	1
you	1
know	1
young	1
people	1
like	1
to	1
be	1
laughed	1
at	1
about	1
them.	1
Lord!	1
how	1
concerned	1
Sir	1
John	1
and	1
my	1
daughters	1
will	1
be	1
when	1
they	1
hear	1
it!	1
If	1
I	1
had	1
my	1
senses	1
about	1
me	1
I	1
might	1
have	1
called	1
in	1
Conduit	1
Street	1
in	1
my	1
way	1
home,	1
and	1
told	1
them	1
of	1
it.	1
But	1
I	1
shall	1
see	1
them	1
tomorrow."	1
"It	1
would	1
be	1
unnecessary	1
I	1
am	1
sure,	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
caution	1
Mrs.	1
Palmer	1
and	1
Sir	1
John	1
against	1
ever	1
naming	1
Mr.	1
Willoughby,	1
or	1
making	1
the	1
slightest	1
allusion	1
to	1
what	1
has	1
passed,	1
before	1
my	1
sister.	1
Their	1
own	1
good-nature	1
must	1
point	1
out	1
to	1
them	1
the	1
real	1
cruelty	1
of	1
appearing	1
to	1
know	1
any	1
thing	1
about	1
it	1
when	1
she	1
is	1
present;	1
and	1
the	1
less	1
that	1
may	1
ever	1
be	1
said	1
to	1
myself	1
on	1
the	1
subject,	1
the	1
more	1
my	1
feelings	1
will	1
be	1
spared,	1
as	1
you	1
my	1
dear	1
madam	1
will	1
easily	1
believe."	1
"Oh!	1
Lord!	1
yes,	1
that	1
I	1
do	1
indeed.	1
It	1
must	1
be	1
terrible	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
hear	1
it	1
talked	1
of;	1
and	1
as	1
for	1
your	1
sister,	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
mention	1
a	1
word	1
about	1
it	1
to	1
her	1
for	1
the	1
world.	1
You	1
saw	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
all	1
dinner	1
time.	1
No	1
more	1
would	1
Sir	1
John,	1
nor	1
my	1
daughters,	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
all	1
very	1
thoughtful	1
and	1
considerate;	1
especially	1
if	1
I	1
give	1
them	1
a	1
hint,	1
as	1
I	1
certainly	1
will.	1
For	1
my	1
part,	1
I	1
think	1
the	1
less	1
that	1
is	1
said	1
about	1
such	1
things,	1
the	1
better,	1
the	1
sooner	1
'tis	1
blown	1
over	1
and	1
forgot.	1
And	1
what	1
does	1
talking	1
ever	1
do	1
you	1
know?"	1
"In	1
this	1
affair	1
it	1
can	1
only	1
do	1
harm;	1
more	1
so	1
perhaps	1
than	1
in	1
many	1
cases	1
of	1
a	1
similar	1
kind,	1
for	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
attended	1
by	1
circumstances	1
which,	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
every	1
one	1
concerned	1
in	1
it,	1
make	1
it	1
unfit	1
to	1
become	1
the	1
public	1
conversation.	1
I	1
must	1
do	1
THIS	1
justice	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Willoughby--he	1
has	1
broken	1
no	1
positive	1
engagement	1
with	1
my	1
sister."	1
"Law,	1
my	1
dear!	1
Don't	1
pretend	1
to	1
defend	1
him.	1
No	1
positive	1
engagement	1
indeed!	1
after	1
taking	1
her	1
all	1
over	1
Allenham	1
House,	1
and	1
fixing	1
on	1
the	1
very	1
rooms	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
live	1
in	1
hereafter!"	1
Elinor,	1
for	1
her	1
sister's	1
sake,	1
could	1
not	1
press	1
the	1
subject	1
farther,	1
and	1
she	1
hoped	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
required	1
of	1
her	1
for	1
Willoughby's;	1
since,	1
though	1
Marianne	1
might	1
lose	1
much,	1
he	1
could	1
gain	1
very	1
little	1
by	1
the	1
enforcement	1
of	1
the	1
real	1
truth.	1
After	1
a	1
short	1
silence	1
on	1
both	1
sides,	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings,	1
with	1
all	1
her	1
natural	1
hilarity,	1
burst	1
forth	1
again.	1
"Well,	1
my	1
dear,	1
'tis	1
a	1
true	1
saying	1
about	1
an	1
ill-wind,	1
for	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
all	1
the	1
better	1
for	1
Colonel	1
Brandon.	1
He	1
will	1
have	1
her	1
at	1
last;	1
aye,	1
that	1
he	1
will.	1
Mind	1
me,	1
now,	1
if	1
they	1
an't	1
married	1
by	1
Mid-summer.	1
Lord!	1
how	1
he'll	1
chuckle	1
over	1
this	1
news!	1
I	1
hope	1
he	1
will	1
come	1
tonight.	1
It	1
will	1
be	1
all	1
to	1
one	1
a	1
better	1
match	1
for	1
your	1
sister.	1
Two	1
thousand	1
a	1
year	1
without	1
debt	1
or	1
drawback--except	1
the	1
little	1
love-child,	1
indeed;	1
aye,	1
I	1
had	1
forgot	1
her;	1
but	1
she	1
may	1
be	1
'prenticed	1
out	1
at	1
a	1
small	1
cost,	1
and	1
then	1
what	1
does	1
it	1
signify?	1
Delaford	1
is	1
a	1
nice	1
place,	1
I	1
can	1
tell	1
you;	1
exactly	1
what	1
I	1
call	1
a	1
nice	1
old	1
fashioned	1
place,	1
full	1
of	1
comforts	1
and	1
conveniences;	1
quite	1
shut	1
in	1
with	1
great	1
garden	1
walls	1
that	1
are	1
covered	1
with	1
the	1
best	1
fruit-trees	1
in	1
the	1
country;	1
and	1
such	1
a	1
mulberry	1
tree	1
in	1
one	1
corner!	1
Lord!	1
how	1
Charlotte	1
and	1
I	1
did	1
stuff	1
the	1
only	1
time	1
we	1
were	1
there!	1
Then,	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
dove-cote,	1
some	1
delightful	1
stew-ponds,	1
and	1
a	1
very	1
pretty	1
canal;	1
and	1
every	1
thing,	1
in	1
short,	1
that	1
one	1
could	1
wish	1
for;	1
and,	1
moreover,	1
it	1
is	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
church,	1
and	1
only	1
a	1
quarter	1
of	1
a	1
mile	1
from	1
the	1
turnpike-road,	1
so	1
'tis	1
never	1
dull,	1
for	1
if	1
you	1
only	1
go	1
and	1
sit	1
up	1
in	1
an	1
old	1
yew	1
arbour	1
behind	1
the	1
house,	1
you	1
may	1
see	1
all	1
the	1
carriages	1
that	1
pass	1
along.	1
Oh!	1
'tis	1
a	1
nice	1
place!	1
A	1
butcher	1
hard	1
by	1
in	1
the	1
village,	1
and	1
the	1
parsonage-house	1
within	1
a	1
stone's	1
throw.	1
To	1
my	1
fancy,	1
a	1
thousand	1
times	1
prettier	1
than	1
Barton	1
Park,	1
where	1
they	1
are	1
forced	1
to	1
send	1
three	1
miles	1
for	1
their	1
meat,	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
a	1
neighbour	1
nearer	1
than	1
your	1
mother.	1
Well,	1
I	1
shall	1
spirit	1
up	1
the	1
Colonel	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
I	1
can.	1
One	1
shoulder	1
of	1
mutton,	1
you	1
know,	1
drives	1
another	1
down.	1
If	1
we	1
CAN	1
but	1
put	1
Willoughby	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
head!"	1
"Ay,	1
if	1
we	1
can	1
do	1
THAT,	1
Ma'am,"	1
said	1
Elinor,	1
"we	1
shall	1
do	1
very	1
well	1
with	1
or	1
without	1
Colonel	1
Brandon."	1
And	1
then	1
rising,	1
she	1
went	1
away	1
to	1
join	1
Marianne,	1
whom	1
she	1
found,	1
as	1
she	1
expected,	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
room,	1
leaning,	1
in	1
silent	1
misery,	1
over	1
the	1
small	1
remains	1
of	1
a	1
fire,	1
which,	1
till	1
Elinor's	1
entrance,	1
had	1
been	1
her	1
only	1
light.	1
"You	1
had	1
better	1
leave	1
me,"	1
was	1
all	1
the	1
notice	1
that	1
her	1
sister	1
received	1
from	1
her.	1
"I	1
will	1
leave	1
you,"	1
said	1
Elinor,	1
"if	1
you	1
will	1
go	1
to	1
bed."	1
But	1
this,	1
from	1
the	1
momentary	1
perverseness	1
of	1
impatient	1
suffering,	1
she	1
at	1
first	1
refused	1
to	1
do.	1
Her	1
sister's	1
earnest,	1
though	1
gentle	1
persuasion,	1
however,	1
soon	1
softened	1
her	1
to	1
compliance,	1
and	1
Elinor	1
saw	1
her	1
lay	1
her	1
aching	1
head	1
on	1
the	1
pillow,	1
and	1
as	1
she	1
hoped,	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
to	1
get	1
some	1
quiet	1
rest	1
before	1
she	1
left	1
her.	1
In	1
the	1
drawing-room,	1
whither	1
she	1
then	1
repaired,	1
she	1
was	1
soon	1
joined	1
by	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings,	1
with	1
a	1
wine-glass,	1
full	1
of	1
something,	1
in	1
her	1
hand.	1
"My	1
dear,"	1
said	1
she,	1
entering,	1
"I	1
have	1
just	1
recollected	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
finest	1
old	1
Constantia	1
wine	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
that	1
ever	1
was	1
tasted,	1
so	1
I	1
have	1
brought	1
a	1
glass	1
of	1
it	1
for	1
your	1
sister.	1
My	1
poor	1
husband!	1
how	1
fond	1
he	1
was	1
of	1
it!	1
Whenever	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
touch	1
of	1
his	1
old	1
colicky	1
gout,	1
he	1
said	1
it	1
did	1
him	1
more	1
good	1
than	1
any	1
thing	1
else	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
Do	1
take	1
it	1
to	1
your	1
sister."	1
"Dear	1
Ma'am,"	1
replied	1
Elinor,	1
smiling	1
at	1
the	1
difference	1
of	1
the	1
complaints	1
for	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
recommended,	1
"how	1
good	1
you	1
are!	1
But	1
I	1
have	1
just	1
left	1
Marianne	1
in	1
bed,	1
and,	1
I	1
hope,	1
almost	1
asleep;	1
and	1
as	1
I	1
think	1
nothing	1
will	1
be	1
of	1
so	1
much	1
service	1
to	1
her	1
as	1
rest,	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
give	1
me	1
leave,	1
I	1
will	1
drink	1
the	1
wine	1
myself."	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings,	1
though	1
regretting	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
five	1
minutes	1
earlier,	1
was	1
satisfied	1
with	1
the	1
compromise;	1
and	1
Elinor,	1
as	1
she	1
swallowed	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
it,	1
reflected,	1
that	1
though	1
its	1
effects	1
on	1
a	1
colicky	1
gout	1
were,	1
at	1
present,	1
of	1
little	1
importance	1
to	1
her,	1
its	1
healing	1
powers,	1
on	1
a	1
disappointed	1
heart	1
might	1
be	1
as	1
reasonably	1
tried	1
on	1
herself	1
as	1
on	1
her	1
sister.	1
Colonel	1
Brandon	1
came	1
in	1
while	1
the	1
party	1
were	1
at	1
tea,	1
and	1
by	1
his	1
manner	1
of	1
looking	1
round	1
the	1
room	1
for	1
Marianne,	1
Elinor	1
immediately	1
fancied	1
that	1
he	1
neither	1
expected	1
nor	1
wished	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
there,	1
and,	1
in	1
short,	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
already	1
aware	1
of	1
what	1
occasioned	1
her	1
absence.	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
was	1
not	1
struck	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
thought;	1
for	1
soon	1
after	1
his	1
entrance,	1
she	1
walked	1
across	1
the	1
room	1
to	1
the	1
tea-table	1
where	1
Elinor	1
presided,	1
and	1
whispered--	1
"The	1
Colonel	1
looks	1
as	1
grave	1
as	1
ever	1
you	1
see.	1
He	1
knows	1
nothing	1
of	1
it;	1
do	1
tell	1
him,	1
my	1
dear."	1
He	1
shortly	1
afterwards	1
drew	1
a	1
chair	1
close	1
to	1
her's,	1
and,	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
which	1
perfectly	1
assured	1
her	1
of	1
his	1
good	1
information,	1
inquired	1
after	1
her	1
sister.	1
"Marianne	1
is	1
not	1
well,"	1
said	1
she.	1
"She	1
has	1
been	1
indisposed	1
all	1
day,	1
and	1
we	1
have	1
persuaded	1
her	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
bed."	1
"Perhaps,	1
then,"	1
he	1
hesitatingly	1
replied,	1
"what	1
I	1
heard	1
this	1
morning	1
may	1
be--there	1
may	1
be	1
more	1
truth	1
in	1
it	1
than	1
I	1
could	1
believe	1
possible	1
at	1
first."	1
"What	1
did	1
you	1
hear?"	1
"That	1
a	1
gentleman,	1
whom	1
I	1
had	1
reason	1
to	1
think--in	1
short,	1
that	1
a	1
man,	1
whom	1
I	1
KNEW	1
to	1
be	1
engaged--but	1
how	1
shall	1
I	1
tell	1
you?	1
If	1
you	1
know	1
it	1
already,	1
as	1
surely	1
you	1
must,	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
spared."	1
"You	1
mean,"	1
answered	1
Elinor,	1
with	1
forced	1
calmness,	1
"Mr.	1
Willoughby's	1
marriage	1
with	1
Miss	1
Grey.	1
Yes,	1
we	1
DO	1
know	1
it	1
all.	1
This	1
seems	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
day	1
of	1
general	1
elucidation,	1
for	1
this	1
very	1
morning	1
first	1
unfolded	1
it	1
to	1
us.	1
Mr.	1
Willoughby	1
is	1
unfathomable!	1
Where	1
did	1
you	1
hear	1
it?"	1
"In	1
a	1
stationer's	1
shop	1
in	1
Pall	1
Mall,	1
where	1
I	1
had	1
business.	1
Two	1
ladies	1
were	1
waiting	1
for	1
their	1
carriage,	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
was	1
giving	1
the	1
other	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
intended	1
match,	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
so	1
little	1
attempting	1
concealment,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
for	1
me	1
not	1
to	1
hear	1
all.	1
The	1
name	1
of	1
Willoughby,	1
John	1
Willoughby,	1
frequently	1
repeated,	1
first	1
caught	1
my	1
attention;	1
and	1
what	1
followed	1
was	1
a	1
positive	1
assertion	1
that	1
every	1
thing	1
was	1
now	1
finally	1
settled	1
respecting	1
his	1
marriage	1
with	1
Miss	1
Grey--it	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
secret--it	1
would	1
take	1
place	1
even	1
within	1
a	1
few	1
weeks,	1
with	1
many	1
particulars	1
of	1
preparations	1
and	1
other	1
matters.	1
One	1
thing,	1
especially,	1
I	1
remember,	1
because	1
it	1
served	1
to	1
identify	1
the	1
man	1
still	1
more:--as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
ceremony	1
was	1
over,	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
Combe	1
Magna,	1
his	1
seat	1
in	1
Somersetshire.	1
My	1
astonishment!--but	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
impossible	1
to	1
describe	1
what	1
I	1
felt.	1
The	1
communicative	1
lady	1
I	1
learnt,	1
on	1
inquiry,	1
for	1
I	1
stayed	1
in	1
the	1
shop	1
till	1
they	1
were	1
gone,	1
was	1
a	1
Mrs.	1
Ellison,	1
and	1
that,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
since	1
informed,	1
is	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Miss	1
Grey's	1
guardian."	1
"It	1
is.	1
But	1
have	1
you	1
likewise	1
heard	1
that	1
Miss	1
Grey	1
has	1
fifty	1
thousand	1
pounds?	1
In	1
that,	1
if	1
in	1
any	1
thing,	1
we	1
may	1
find	1
an	1
explanation."	1
"It	1
may	1
be	1
so;	1
but	1
Willoughby	1
is	1
capable--at	1
least	1
I	1
think"--he	1
stopped	1
a	1
moment;	1
then	1
added	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
distrust	1
itself,	1
"And	1
your	1
sister--	1
how	1
did	1
she--"	1
"Her	1
sufferings	1
have	1
been	1
very	1
severe.	1
I	1
have	1
only	1
to	1
hope	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
proportionately	1
short.	1
It	1
has	1
been,	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
most	1
cruel	1
affliction.	1
Till	1
yesterday,	1
I	1
believe,	1
she	1
never	1
doubted	1
his	1
regard;	1
and	1
even	1
now,	1
perhaps--but	1
I	1
am	1
almost	1
convinced	1
that	1
he	1
never	1
was	1
really	1
attached	1
to	1
her.	1
He	1
has	1
been	1
very	1
deceitful!	1
and,	1
in	1
some	1
points,	1
there	1
seems	1
a	1
hardness	1
of	1
heart	1
about	1
him."	1
"Ah!"	1
said	1
Colonel	1
Brandon,	1
"there	1
is,	1
indeed!	1
But	1
your	1
sister	1
does	1
not--I	1
think	1
you	1
said	1
so--she	1
does	1
not	1
consider	1
quite	1
as	1
you	1
do?"	1
"You	1
know	1
her	1
disposition,	1
and	1
may	1
believe	1
how	1
eagerly	1
she	1
would	1
still	1
justify	1
him	1
if	1
she	1
could."	1
He	1
made	1
no	1
answer;	1
and	1
soon	1
afterwards,	1
by	1
the	1
removal	1
of	1
the	1
tea-things,	1
and	1
the	1
arrangement	1
of	1
the	1
card	1
parties,	1
the	1
subject	1
was	1
necessarily	1
dropped.	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings,	1
who	1
had	1
watched	1
them	1
with	1
pleasure	1
while	1
they	1
were	1
talking,	1
and	1
who	1
expected	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
effect	1
of	1
Miss	1
Dashwood's	1
communication,	1
in	1
such	1
an	1
instantaneous	1
gaiety	1
on	1
Colonel	1
Brandon's	1
side,	1
as	1
might	1
have	1
become	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
bloom	1
of	1
youth,	1
of	1
hope	1
and	1
happiness,	1
saw	1
him,	1
with	1
amazement,	1
remain	1
the	1
whole	1
evening	1
more	1
serious	1
and	1
thoughtful	1
than	1
usual.	1
CHAPTER	1
31	1
From	1
a	1
night	1
of	1
more	1
sleep	1
than	1
she	1
had	1
expected,	1
Marianne	1
awoke	1
the	1
next	1
morning	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
consciousness	1
of	1
misery	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
closed	1
her	1
eyes.	1
Elinor	1
encouraged	1
her	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
possible	1
to	1
talk	1
of	1
what	1
she	1
felt;	1
and	1
before	1
breakfast	1
was	1
ready,	1
they	1
had	1
gone	1
through	1
the	1
subject	1
again	1
and	1
again;	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
steady	1
conviction	1
and	1
affectionate	1
counsel	1
on	1
Elinor's	1
side,	1
the	1
same	1
impetuous	1
feelings	1
and	1
varying	1
opinions	1
on	1
Marianne's,	1
as	1
before.	1
Sometimes	1
she	1
could	1
believe	1
Willoughby	1
to	1
be	1
as	1
unfortunate	1
and	1
as	1
innocent	1
as	1
herself,	1
and	1
at	1
others,	1
lost	1
every	1
consolation	1
in	1
the	1
impossibility	1
of	1
acquitting	1
him.	1
At	1
one	1
moment	1
she	1
was	1
absolutely	1
indifferent	1
to	1
the	1
observation	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
world,	1
at	1
another	1
she	1
would	1
seclude	1
herself	1
from	1
it	1
for	1
ever,	1
and	1
at	1
a	1
third	1
could	1
resist	1
it	1
with	1
energy.	1
In	1
one	1
thing,	1
however,	1
she	1
was	1
uniform,	1
when	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
point,	1
in	1
avoiding,	1
where	1
it	1
was	1
possible,	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
determined	1
silence	1
when	1
obliged	1
to	1
endure	1
it.	1
Her	1
heart	1
was	1
hardened	1
against	1
the	1
belief	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings's	1
entering	1
into	1
her	1
sorrows	1
with	1
any	1
compassion.	1
"No,	1
no,	1
no,	1
it	1
cannot	1
be,"	1
she	1
cried;	1
"she	1
cannot	1
feel.	1
Her	1
kindness	1
is	1
not	1
sympathy;	1
her	1
good-nature	1
is	1
not	1
tenderness.	1
All	1
that	1
she	1
wants	1
is	1
gossip,	1
and	1
she	1
only	1
likes	1
me	1
now	1
because	1
I	1
supply	1
it."	1
Elinor	1
had	1
not	1
needed	1
this	1
to	1
be	1
assured	1
of	1
the	1
injustice	1
to	1
which	1
her	1
sister	1
was	1
often	1
led	1
in	1
her	1
opinion	1
of	1
others,	1
by	1
the	1
irritable	1
refinement	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
mind,	1
and	1
the	1
too	1
great	1
importance	1
placed	1
by	1
her	1
on	1
the	1
delicacies	1
of	1
a	1
strong	1
sensibility,	1
and	1
the	1
graces	1
of	1
a	1
polished	1
manner.	1
Like	1
half	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
if	1
more	1
than	1
half	1
there	1
be	1
that	1
are	1
clever	1
and	1
good,	1
Marianne,	1
with	1
excellent	1
abilities	1
and	1
an	1
excellent	1
disposition,	1
was	1
neither	1
reasonable	1
nor	1
candid.	1
She	1
expected	1
from	1
other	1
people	1
the	1
same	1
opinions	1
and	1
feelings	1
as	1
her	1
own,	1
and	1
she	1
judged	1
of	1
their	1
motives	1
by	1
the	1
immediate	1
effect	1
of	1
their	1
actions	1
on	1
herself.	1
Thus	1
a	1
circumstance	1
occurred,	1
while	1
the	1
sisters	1
were	1
together	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
room	1
after	1
breakfast,	1
which	1
sunk	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
still	1
lower	1
in	1
her	1
estimation;	1
because,	1
through	1
her	1
own	1
weakness,	1
it	1
chanced	1
to	1
prove	1
a	1
source	1
of	1
fresh	1
pain	1
to	1
herself,	1
though	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
was	1
governed	1
in	1
it	1
by	1
an	1
impulse	1
of	1
the	1
utmost	1
goodwill.	1
With	1
a	1
letter	1
in	1
her	1
outstretched	1
hand,	1
and	1
countenance	1
gaily	1
smiling,	1
from	1
the	1
persuasion	1
of	1
bringing	1
comfort,	1
she	1
entered	1
their	1
room,	1
saying,	1
"Now,	1
my	1
dear,	1
I	1
bring	1
you	1
something	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
will	1
do	1
you	1
good."	1
Marianne	1
heard	1
enough.	1
In	1
one	1
moment	1
her	1
imagination	1
placed	1
before	1
her	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
Willoughby,	1
full	1
of	1
tenderness	1
and	1
contrition,	1
explanatory	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
passed,	1
satisfactory,	1
convincing;	1
and	1
instantly	1
followed	1
by	1
Willoughby	1
himself,	1
rushing	1
eagerly	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
to	1
inforce,	1
at	1
her	1
feet,	1
by	1
the	1
eloquence	1
of	1
his	1
eyes,	1
the	1
assurances	1
of	1
his	1
letter.	1
The	1
work	1
of	1
one	1
moment	1
was	1
destroyed	1
by	1
the	1
next.	1
The	1
hand	1
writing	1
of	1
her	1
mother,	1
never	1
till	1
then	1
unwelcome,	1
was	1
before	1
her;	1
and,	1
in	1
the	1
acuteness	1
of	1
the	1
disappointment	1
which	1
followed	1
such	1
an	1
ecstasy	1
of	1
more	1
than	1
hope,	1
she	1
felt	1
as	1
if,	1
till	1
that	1
instant,	1
she	1
had	1
never	1
suffered.	1
The	1
cruelty	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
no	1
language,	1
within	1
her	1
reach	1
in	1
her	1
moments	1
of	1
happiest	1
eloquence,	1
could	1
have	1
expressed;	1
and	1
now	1
she	1
could	1
reproach	1
her	1
only	1
by	1
the	1
tears	1
which	1
streamed	1
from	1
her	1
eyes	1
with	1
passionate	1
violence--a	1
reproach,	1
however,	1
so	1
entirely	1
lost	1
on	1
its	1
object,	1
that	1
after	1
many	1
expressions	1
of	1
pity,	1
she	1
withdrew,	1
still	1
referring	1
her	1
to	1
the	1
letter	1
of	1
comfort.	1
But	1
the	1
letter,	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
calm	1
enough	1
to	1
read	1
it,	1
brought	1
little	1
comfort.	1
Willoughby	1
filled	1
every	1
page.	1
Her	1
mother,	1
still	1
confident	1
of	1
their	1
engagement,	1
and	1
relying	1
as	1
warmly	1
as	1
ever	1
on	1
his	1
constancy,	1
had	1
only	1
been	1
roused	1
by	1
Elinor's	1
application,	1
to	1
intreat	1
from	1
Marianne	1
greater	1
openness	1
towards	1
them	1
both;	1
and	1
this,	1
with	1
such	1
tenderness	1
towards	1
her,	1
such	1
affection	1
for	1
Willoughby,	1
and	1
such	1
a	1
conviction	1
of	1
their	1
future	1
happiness	1
in	1
each	1
other,	1
that	1
she	1
wept	1
with	1
agony	1
through	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
it.	1
All	1
her	1
impatience	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
home	1
again	1
now	1
returned;	1
her	1
mother	1
was	1
dearer	1
to	1
her	1
than	1
ever;	1
dearer	1
through	1
the	1
very	1
excess	1
of	1
her	1
mistaken	1
confidence	1
in	1
Willoughby,	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
wildly	1
urgent	1
to	1
be	1
gone.	1
Elinor,	1
unable	1
herself	1
to	1
determine	1
whether	1
it	1
were	1
better	1
for	1
Marianne	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
London	1
or	1
at	1
Barton,	1
offered	1
no	1
counsel	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
except	1
of	1
patience	1
till	1
their	1
mother's	1
wishes	1
could	1
be	1
known;	1
and	1
at	1
length	1
she	1
obtained	1
her	1
sister's	1
consent	1
to	1
wait	1
for	1
that	1
knowledge.	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
left	1
them	1
earlier	1
than	1
usual;	1
for	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
easy	1
till	1
the	1
Middletons	1
and	1
Palmers	1
were	1
able	1
to	1
grieve	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
herself;	1
and	1
positively	1
refusing	1
Elinor's	1
offered	1
attendance,	1
went	1
out	1
alone	1
for	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
morning.	1
Elinor,	1
with	1
a	1
very	1
heavy	1
heart,	1
aware	1
of	1
the	1
pain	1
she	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
communicate,	1
and	1
perceiving,	1
by	1
Marianne's	1
letter,	1
how	1
ill	1
she	1
had	1
succeeded	1
in	1
laying	1
any	1
foundation	1
for	1
it,	1
then	1
sat	1
down	1
to	1
write	1
her	1
mother	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
what	1
had	1
passed,	1
and	1
entreat	1
her	1
directions	1
for	1
the	1
future;	1
while	1
Marianne,	1
who	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
drawing-room	1
on	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings's	1
going	1
away,	1
remained	1
fixed	1
at	1
the	1
table	1
where	1
Elinor	1
wrote,	1
watching	1
the	1
advancement	1
of	1
her	1
pen,	1
grieving	1
over	1
her	1
for	1
the	1
hardship	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
task,	1
and	1
grieving	1
still	1
more	1
fondly	1
over	1
its	1
effect	1
on	1
her	1
mother.	1
In	1
this	1
manner	1
they	1
had	1
continued	1
about	1
a	1
quarter	1
of	1
an	1
hour,	1
when	1
Marianne,	1
whose	1
nerves	1
could	1
not	1
then	1
bear	1
any	1
sudden	1
noise,	1
was	1
startled	1
by	1
a	1
rap	1
at	1
the	1
door.	1
"Who	1
can	1
this	1
be?"	1
cried	1
Elinor.	1
"So	1
early	1
too!	1
I	1
thought	1
we	1
HAD	1
been	1
safe."	1
Marianne	1
moved	1
to	1
the	1
window--	1
"It	1
is	1
Colonel	1
Brandon!"	1
said	1
she,	1
with	1
vexation.	1
"We	1
are	1
never	1
safe	1
from	1
HIM."	1
"He	1
will	1
not	1
come	1
in,	1
as	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
is	1
from	1
home."	1
"I	1
will	1
not	1
trust	1
to	1
THAT,"	1
retreating	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
room.	1
"A	1
man	1
who	1
has	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
time	1
has	1
no	1
conscience	1
in	1
his	1
intrusion	1
on	1
that	1
of	1
others."	1
The	1
event	1
proved	1
her	1
conjecture	1
right,	1
though	1
it	1
was	1
founded	1
on	1
injustice	1
and	1
error;	1
for	1
Colonel	1
Brandon	1
DID	1
come	1
in;	1
and	1
Elinor,	1
who	1
was	1
convinced	1
that	1
solicitude	1
for	1
Marianne	1
brought	1
him	1
thither,	1
and	1
who	1
saw	1
THAT	1
solicitude	1
in	1
his	1
disturbed	1
and	1
melancholy	1
look,	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
anxious	1
though	1
brief	1
inquiry	1
after	1
her,	1
could	1
not	1
forgive	1
her	1
sister	1
for	1
esteeming	1
him	1
so	1
lightly.	1
"I	1
met	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
in	1
Bond	1
Street,"	1
said	1
he,	1
after	1
the	1
first	1
salutation,	1
"and	1
she	1
encouraged	1
me	1
to	1
come	1
on;	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
the	1
more	1
easily	1
encouraged,	1
because	1
I	1
thought	1
it	1
probable	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
find	1
you	1
alone,	1
which	1
I	1
was	1
very	1
desirous	1
of	1
doing.	1
My	1
object--my	1
wish--my	1
sole	1
wish	1
in	1
desiring	1
it--I	1
hope,	1
I	1
believe	1
it	1
is--is	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
means	1
of	1
giving	1
comfort;--no,	1
I	1
must	1
not	1
say	1
comfort--not	1
present	1
comfort--but	1
conviction,	1
lasting	1
conviction	1
to	1
your	1
sister's	1
mind.	1
My	1
regard	1
for	1
her,	1
for	1
yourself,	1
for	1
your	1
mother--will	1
you	1
allow	1
me	1
to	1
prove	1
it,	1
by	1
relating	1
some	1
circumstances	1
which	1
nothing	1
but	1
a	1
VERY	1
sincere	1
regard--nothing	1
but	1
an	1
earnest	1
desire	1
of	1
being	1
useful--I	1
think	1
I	1
am	1
justified--though	1
where	1
so	1
many	1
hours	1
have	1
been	1
spent	1
in	1
convincing	1
myself	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
right,	1
is	1
there	1
not	1
some	1
reason	1
to	1
fear	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
wrong?"	1
He	1
stopped.	1
"I	1
understand	1
you,"	1
said	1
Elinor.	1
"You	1
have	1
something	1
to	1
tell	1
me	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Willoughby,	1
that	1
will	1
open	1
his	1
character	1
farther.	1
Your	1
telling	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
greatest	1
act	1
of	1
friendship	1
that	1
can	1
be	1
shewn	1
Marianne.	1
MY	1
gratitude	1
will	1
be	1
insured	1
immediately	1
by	1
any	1
information	1
tending	1
to	1
that	1
end,	1
and	1
HERS	1
must	1
be	1
gained	1
by	1
it	1
in	1
time.	1
Pray,	1
pray	1
let	1
me	1
hear	1
it."	1
"You	1
shall;	1
and,	1
to	1
be	1
brief,	1
when	1
I	1
quitted	1
Barton	1
last	1
October,--but	1
this	1
will	1
give	1
you	1
no	1
idea--I	1
must	1
go	1
farther	1
back.	1
You	1
will	1
find	1
me	1
a	1
very	1
awkward	1
narrator,	1
Miss	1
Dashwood;	1
I	1
hardly	1
know	1
where	1
to	1
begin.	1
A	1
short	1
account	1
of	1
myself,	1
I	1
believe,	1
will	1
be	1
necessary,	1
and	1
it	1
SHALL	1
be	1
a	1
short	1
one.	1
On	1
such	1
a	1
subject,"	1
sighing	1
heavily,	1
"can	1
I	1
have	1
little	1
temptation	1
to	1
be	1
diffuse."	1
He	1
stopt	1
a	1
moment	1
for	1
recollection,	1
and	1
then,	1
with	1
another	1
sigh,	1
went	1
on.	1
"You	1
have	1
probably	1
entirely	1
forgotten	1
a	1
conversation--	1
(it	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
supposed	1
that	1
it	1
could	1
make	1
any	1
impression	1
on	1
you)--a	1
conversation	1
between	1
us	1
one	1
evening	1
at	1
Barton	1
Park--it	1
was	1
the	1
evening	1
of	1
a	1
dance--in	1
which	1
I	1
alluded	1
to	1
a	1
lady	1
I	1
had	1
once	1
known,	1
as	1
resembling,	1
in	1
some	1
measure,	1
your	1
sister	1
Marianne."	1
"Indeed,"	1
answered	1
Elinor,	1
"I	1
have	1
NOT	1
forgotten	1
it."	1
He	1
looked	1
pleased	1
by	1
this	1
remembrance,	1
and	1
added,	1
"If	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
deceived	1
by	1
the	1
uncertainty,	1
the	1
partiality	1
of	1
tender	1
recollection,	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
strong	1
resemblance	1
between	1
them,	1
as	1
well	1
in	1
mind	1
as	1
person.	1
The	1
same	1
warmth	1
of	1
heart,	1
the	1
same	1
eagerness	1
of	1
fancy	1
and	1
spirits.	1
This	1
lady	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
my	1
nearest	1
relations,	1
an	1
orphan	1
from	1
her	1
infancy,	1
and	1
under	1
the	1
guardianship	1
of	1
my	1
father.	1
Our	1
ages	1
were	1
nearly	1
the	1
same,	1
and	1
from	1
our	1
earliest	1
years	1
we	1
were	1
playfellows	1
and	1
friends.	1
I	1
cannot	1
remember	1
the	1
time	1
when	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
love	1
Eliza;	1
and	1
my	1
affection	1
for	1
her,	1
as	1
we	1
grew	1
up,	1
was	1
such,	1
as	1
perhaps,	1
judging	1
from	1
my	1
present	1
forlorn	1
and	1
cheerless	1
gravity,	1
you	1
might	1
think	1
me	1
incapable	1
of	1
having	1
ever	1
felt.	1
Her's,	1
for	1
me,	1
was,	1
I	1
believe,	1
fervent	1
as	1
the	1
attachment	1
of	1
your	1
sister	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Willoughby	1
and	1
it	1
was,	1
though	1
from	1
a	1
different	1
cause,	1
no	1
less	1
unfortunate.	1
At	1
seventeen	1
she	1
was	1
lost	1
to	1
me	1
for	1
ever.	1
She	1
was	1
married--married	1
against	1
her	1
inclination	1
to	1
my	1
brother.	1
Her	1
fortune	1
was	1
large,	1
and	1
our	1
family	1
estate	1
much	1
encumbered.	1
And	1
this,	1
I	1
fear,	1
is	1
all	1
that	1
can	1
be	1
said	1
for	1
the	1
conduct	1
of	1
one,	1
who	1
was	1
at	1
once	1
her	1
uncle	1
and	1
guardian.	1
My	1
brother	1
did	1
not	1
deserve	1
her;	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
love	1
her.	1
I	1
had	1
hoped	1
that	1
her	1
regard	1
for	1
me	1
would	1
support	1
her	1
under	1
any	1
difficulty,	1
and	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
it	1
did;	1
but	1
at	1
last	1
the	1
misery	1
of	1
her	1
situation,	1
for	1
she	1
experienced	1
great	1
unkindness,	1
overcame	1
all	1
her	1
resolution,	1
and	1
though	1
she	1
had	1
promised	1
me	1
that	1
nothing--but	1
how	1
blindly	1
I	1
relate!	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
told	1
you	1
how	1
this	1
was	1
brought	1
on.	1
We	1
were	1
within	1
a	1
few	1
hours	1
of	1
eloping	1
together	1
for	1
Scotland.	1
The	1
treachery,	1
or	1
the	1
folly,	1
of	1
my	1
cousin's	1
maid	1
betrayed	1
us.	1
I	1
was	1
banished	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
a	1
relation	1
far	1
distant,	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
allowed	1
no	1
liberty,	1
no	1
society,	1
no	1
amusement,	1
till	1
my	1
father's	1
point	1
was	1
gained.	1
I	1
had	1
depended	1
on	1
her	1
fortitude	1
too	1
far,	1
and	1
the	1
blow	1
was	1
a	1
severe	1
one--	1
but	1
had	1
her	1
marriage	1
been	1
happy,	1
so	1
young	1
as	1
I	1
then	1
was,	1
a	1
few	1
months	1
must	1
have	1
reconciled	1
me	1
to	1
it,	1
or	1
at	1
least	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
now	1
to	1
lament	1
it.	1
This	1
however	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
case.	1
My	1
brother	1
had	1
no	1
regard	1
for	1
her;	1
his	1
pleasures	1
were	1
not	1
what	1
they	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
been,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
he	1
treated	1
her	1
unkindly.	1
The	1
consequence	1
of	1
this,	1
upon	1
a	1
mind	1
so	1
young,	1
so	1
lively,	1
so	1
inexperienced	1
as	1
Mrs.	1
Brandon's,	1
was	1
but	1
too	1
natural.	1
She	1
resigned	1
herself	1
at	1
first	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
misery	1
of	1
her	1
situation;	1
and	1
happy	1
had	1
it	1
been	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
lived	1
to	1
overcome	1
those	1
regrets	1
which	1
the	1
remembrance	1
of	1
me	1
occasioned.	1
But	1
can	1
we	1
wonder	1
that,	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
husband	1
to	1
provoke	1
inconstancy,	1
and	1
without	1
a	1
friend	1
to	1
advise	1
or	1
restrain	1
her	1
(for	1
my	1
father	1
lived	1
only	1
a	1
few	1
months	1
after	1
their	1
marriage,	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
with	1
my	1
regiment	1
in	1
the	1
East	1
Indies)	1
she	1
should	1
fall?	1
Had	1
I	1
remained	1
in	1
England,	1
perhaps--but	1
I	1
meant	1
to	1
promote	1
the	1
happiness	1
of	1
both	1
by	1
removing	1
from	1
her	1
for	1
years,	1
and	1
for	1
that	1
purpose	1
had	1
procured	1
my	1
exchange.	1
The	1
shock	1
which	1
her	1
marriage	1
had	1
given	1
me,"	1
he	1
continued,	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
of	1
great	1
agitation,	1
"was	1
of	1
trifling	1
weight--was	1
nothing	1
to	1
what	1
I	1
felt	1
when	1
I	1
heard,	1
about	1
two	1
years	1
afterwards,	1
of	1
her	1
divorce.	1
It	1
was	1
THAT	1
which	1
threw	1
this	1
gloom,--even	1
now	1
the	1
recollection	1
of	1
what	1
I	1
suffered--"	1
He	1
could	1
say	1
no	1
more,	1
and	1
rising	1
hastily	1
walked	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
about	1
the	1
room.	1
Elinor,	1
affected	1
by	1
his	1
relation,	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
by	1
his	1
distress,	1
could	1
not	1
speak.	1
He	1
saw	1
her	1
concern,	1
and	1
coming	1
to	1
her,	1
took	1
her	1
hand,	1
pressed	1
it,	1
and	1
kissed	1
it	1
with	1
grateful	1
respect.	1
A	1
few	1
minutes	1
more	1
of	1
silent	1
exertion	1
enabled	1
him	1
to	1
proceed	1
with	1
composure.	1
"It	1
was	1
nearly	1
three	1
years	1
after	1
this	1
unhappy	1
period	1
before	1
I	1
returned	1
to	1
England.	1
My	1
first	1
care,	1
when	1
I	1
DID	1
arrive,	1
was	1
of	1
course	1
to	1
seek	1
for	1
her;	1
but	1
the	1
search	1
was	1
as	1
fruitless	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
melancholy.	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
trace	1
her	1
beyond	1
her	1
first	1
seducer,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
every	1
reason	1
to	1
fear	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
removed	1
from	1
him	1
only	1
to	1
sink	1
deeper	1
in	1
a	1
life	1
of	1
sin.	1
Her	1
legal	1
allowance	1
was	1
not	1
adequate	1
to	1
her	1
fortune,	1
nor	1
sufficient	1
for	1
her	1
comfortable	1
maintenance,	1
and	1
I	1
learnt	1
from	1
my	1
brother	1
that	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
receiving	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
made	1
over	1
some	1
months	1
before	1
to	1
another	1
person.	1
He	1
imagined,	1
and	1
calmly	1
could	1
he	1
imagine	1
it,	1
that	1
her	1
extravagance,	1
and	1
consequent	1
distress,	1
had	1
obliged	1
her	1
to	1
dispose	1
of	1
it	1
for	1
some	1
immediate	1
relief.	1
At	1
last,	1
however,	1
and	1
after	1
I	1
had	1
been	1
six	1
months	1
in	1
England,	1
I	1
DID	1
find	1
her.	1
Regard	1
for	1
a	1
former	1
servant	1
of	1
my	1
own,	1
who	1
had	1
since	1
fallen	1
into	1
misfortune,	1
carried	1
me	1
to	1
visit	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
spunging-house,	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
confined	1
for	1
debt;	1
and	1
there,	1
the	1
same	1
house,	1
under	1
a	1
similar	1
confinement,	1
was	1
my	1
unfortunate	1
sister.	1
So	1
altered--so	1
faded--worn	1
down	1
by	1
acute	1
suffering	1
of	1
every	1
kind!	1
hardly	1
could	1
I	1
believe	1
the	1
melancholy	1
and	1
sickly	1
figure	1
before	1
me,	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
remains	1
of	1
the	1
lovely,	1
blooming,	1
healthful	1
girl,	1
on	1
whom	1
I	1
had	1
once	1
doted.	1
What	1
I	1
endured	1
in	1
so	1
beholding	1
her--but	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
right	1
to	1
wound	1
your	1
feelings	1
by	1
attempting	1
to	1
describe	1
it--I	1
have	1
pained	1
you	1
too	1
much	1
already.	1
That	1
she	1
was,	1
to	1
all	1
appearance,	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
stage	1
of	1
a	1
consumption,	1
was--yes,	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
situation	1
it	1
was	1
my	1
greatest	1
comfort.	1
Life	1
could	1
do	1
nothing	1
for	1
her,	1
beyond	1
giving	1
time	1
for	1
a	1
better	1
preparation	1
for	1
death;	1
and	1
that	1
was	1
given.	1
I	1
saw	1
her	1
placed	1
in	1
comfortable	1
lodgings,	1
and	1
under	1
proper	1
attendants;	1
I	1
visited	1
her	1
every	1
day	1
during	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
her	1
short	1
life:	1
I	1
was	1
with	1
her	1
in	1
her	1
last	1
moments."	1
Again	1
he	1
stopped	1
to	1
recover	1
himself;	1
and	1
Elinor	1
spoke	1
her	1
feelings	1
in	1
an	1
exclamation	1
of	1
tender	1
concern,	1
at	1
the	1
fate	1
of	1
his	1
unfortunate	1
friend.	1
"Your	1
sister,	1
I	1
hope,	1
cannot	1
be	1
offended,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"by	1
the	1
resemblance	1
I	1
have	1
fancied	1
between	1
her	1
and	1
my	1
poor	1
disgraced	1
relation.	1
Their	1
fates,	1
their	1
fortunes,	1
cannot	1
be	1
the	1
same;	1
and	1
had	1
the	1
natural	1
sweet	1
disposition	1
of	1
the	1
one	1
been	1
guarded	1
by	1
a	1
firmer	1
mind,	1
or	1
a	1
happier	1
marriage,	1
she	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
all	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
live	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
other	1
be.	1
But	1
to	1
what	1
does	1
all	1
this	1
lead?	1
I	1
seem	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
distressing	1
you	1
for	1
nothing.	1
Ah!	1
Miss	1
Dashwood--a	1
subject	1
such	1
as	1
this--untouched	1
for	1
fourteen	1
years--it	1
is	1
dangerous	1
to	1
handle	1
it	1
at	1
all!	1
I	1
WILL	1
be	1
more	1
collected--more	1
concise.	1
She	1
left	1
to	1
my	1
care	1
her	1
only	1
child,	1
a	1
little	1
girl,	1
the	1
offspring	1
of	1
her	1
first	1
guilty	1
connection,	1
who	1
was	1
then	1
about	1
three	1
years	1
old.	1
She	1
loved	1
the	1
child,	1
and	1
had	1
always	1
kept	1
it	1
with	1
her.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
valued,	1
a	1
precious	1
trust	1
to	1
me;	1
and	1
gladly	1
would	1
I	1
have	1
discharged	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
strictest	1
sense,	1
by	1
watching	1
over	1
her	1
education	1
myself,	1
had	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
our	1
situations	1
allowed	1
it;	1
but	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
family,	1
no	1
home;	1
and	1
my	1
little	1
Eliza	1
was	1
therefore	1
placed	1
at	1
school.	1
I	1
saw	1
her	1
there	1
whenever	1
I	1
could,	1
and	1
after	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
my	1
brother,	1
(which	1
happened	1
about	1
five	1
years	1
ago,	1
and	1
which	1
left	1
to	1
me	1
the	1
possession	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
property,)	1
she	1
visited	1
me	1
at	1
Delaford.	1
I	1
called	1
her	1
a	1
distant	1
relation;	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
well	1
aware	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
in	1
general	1
been	1
suspected	1
of	1
a	1
much	1
nearer	1
connection	1
with	1
her.	1
It	1
is	1
now	1
three	1
years	1
ago	1
(she	1
had	1
just	1
reached	1
her	1
fourteenth	1
year,)	1
that	1
I	1
removed	1
her	1
from	1
school,	1
to	1
place	1
her	1
under	1
the	1
care	1
of	1
a	1
very	1
respectable	1
woman,	1
residing	1
in	1
Dorsetshire,	1
who	1
had	1
the	1
charge	1
of	1
four	1
or	1
five	1
other	1
girls	1
of	1
about	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
of	1
life;	1
and	1
for	1
two	1
years	1
I	1
had	1
every	1
reason	1
to	1
be	1
pleased	1
with	1
her	1
situation.	1
But	1
last	1
February,	1
almost	1
a	1
twelvemonth	1
back,	1
she	1
suddenly	1
disappeared.	1
I	1
had	1
allowed	1
her,	1
(imprudently,	1
as	1
it	1
has	1
since	1
turned	1
out,)	1
at	1
her	1
earnest	1
desire,	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
Bath	1
with	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
young	1
friends,	1
who	1
was	1
attending	1
her	1
father	1
there	1
for	1
his	1
health.	1
I	1
knew	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
sort	1
of	1
man,	1
and	1
I	1
thought	1
well	1
of	1
his	1
daughter--better	1
than	1
she	1
deserved,	1
for,	1
with	1
a	1
most	1
obstinate	1
and	1
ill-judged	1
secrecy,	1
she	1
would	1
tell	1
nothing,	1
would	1
give	1
no	1
clue,	1
though	1
she	1
certainly	1
knew	1
all.	1
He,	1
her	1
father,	1
a	1
well-meaning,	1
but	1
not	1
a	1
quick-sighted	1
man,	1
could	1
really,	1
I	1
believe,	1
give	1
no	1
information;	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
generally	1
confined	1
to	1
the	1
house,	1
while	1
the	1
girls	1
were	1
ranging	1
over	1
the	1
town	1
and	1
making	1
what	1
acquaintance	1
they	1
chose;	1
and	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
convince	1
me,	1
as	1
thoroughly	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
convinced	1
himself,	1
of	1
his	1
daughter's	1
being	1
entirely	1
unconcerned	1
in	1
the	1
business.	1
In	1
short,	1
I	1
could	1
learn	1
nothing	1
but	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
gone;	1
all	1
the	1
rest,	1
for	1
eight	1
long	1
months,	1
was	1
left	1
to	1
conjecture.	1
What	1
I	1
thought,	1
what	1
I	1
feared,	1
may	1
be	1
imagined;	1
and	1
what	1
I	1
suffered	1
too."	1
"Good	1
heavens!"	1
cried	1
Elinor,	1
"could	1
it	1
be--could	1
Willoughby!"--	1
"The	1
first	1
news	1
that	1
reached	1
me	1
of	1
her,"	1
he	1
continued,	1
"came	1
in	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
herself,	1
last	1
October.	1
It	1
was	1
forwarded	1
to	1
me	1
from	1
Delaford,	1
and	1
I	1
received	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
very	1
morning	1
of	1
our	1
intended	1
party	1
to	1
Whitwell;	1
and	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
reason	1
of	1
my	1
leaving	1
Barton	1
so	1
suddenly,	1
which	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
must	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
have	1
appeared	1
strange	1
to	1
every	1
body,	1
and	1
which	1
I	1
believe	1
gave	1
offence	1
to	1
some.	1
Little	1
did	1
Mr.	1
Willoughby	1
imagine,	1
I	1
suppose,	1
when	1
his	1
looks	1
censured	1
me	1
for	1
incivility	1
in	1
breaking	1
up	1
the	1
party,	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
called	1
away	1
to	1
the	1
relief	1
of	1
one	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
poor	1
and	1
miserable;	1
but	1
HAD	1
he	1
known	1
it,	1
what	1
would	1
it	1
have	1
availed?	1
Would	1
he	1
have	1
been	1
less	1
gay	1
or	1
less	1
happy	1
in	1
the	1
smiles	1
of	1
your	1
sister?	1
No,	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
done	1
that,	1
which	1
no	1
man	1
who	1
CAN	1
feel	1
for	1
another	1
would	1
do.	1
He	1
had	1
left	1
the	1
girl	1
whose	1
youth	1
and	1
innocence	1
he	1
had	1
seduced,	1
in	1
a	1
situation	1
of	1
the	1
utmost	1
distress,	1
with	1
no	1
creditable	1
home,	1
no	1
help,	1
no	1
friends,	1
ignorant	1
of	1
his	1
address!	1
He	1
had	1
left	1
her,	1
promising	1
to	1
return;	1
he	1
neither	1
returned,	1
nor	1
wrote,	1
nor	1
relieved	1
her."	1
"This	1
is	1
beyond	1
every	1
thing!"	1
exclaimed	1
Elinor.	1
"His	1
character	1
is	1
now	1
before	1
you;	1
expensive,	1
dissipated,	1
and	1
worse	1
than	1
both.	1
Knowing	1
all	1
this,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
now	1
known	1
it	1
many	1
weeks,	1
guess	1
what	1
I	1
must	1
have	1
felt	1
on	1
seeing	1
your	1
sister	1
as	1
fond	1
of	1
him	1
as	1
ever,	1
and	1
on	1
being	1
assured	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
to	1
marry	1
him:	1
guess	1
what	1
I	1
must	1
have	1
felt	1
for	1
all	1
your	1
sakes.	1
When	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
you	1
last	1
week	1
and	1
found	1
you	1
alone,	1
I	1
came	1
determined	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
truth;	1
though	1
irresolute	1
what	1
to	1
do	1
when	1
it	1
WAS	1
known.	1
My	1
behaviour	1
must	1
have	1
seemed	1
strange	1
to	1
you	1
then;	1
but	1
now	1
you	1
will	1
comprehend	1
it.	1
To	1
suffer	1
you	1
all	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
deceived;	1
to	1
see	1
your	1
sister--but	1
what	1
could	1
I	1
do?	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
hope	1
of	1
interfering	1
with	1
success;	1
and	1
sometimes	1
I	1
thought	1
your	1
sister's	1
influence	1
might	1
yet	1
reclaim	1
him.	1
But	1
now,	1
after	1
such	1
dishonorable	1
usage,	1
who	1
can	1
tell	1
what	1
were	1
his	1
designs	1
on	1
her.	1
Whatever	1
they	1
may	1
have	1
been,	1
however,	1
she	1
may	1
now,	1
and	1
hereafter	1
doubtless	1
WILL	1
turn	1
with	1
gratitude	1
towards	1
her	1
own	1
condition,	1
when	1
she	1
compares	1
it	1
with	1
that	1
of	1
my	1
poor	1
Eliza,	1
when	1
she	1
considers	1
the	1
wretched	1
and	1
hopeless	1
situation	1
of	1
this	1
poor	1
girl,	1
and	1
pictures	1
her	1
to	1
herself,	1
with	1
an	1
affection	1
for	1
him	1
so	1
strong,	1
still	1
as	1
strong	1
as	1
her	1
own,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
mind	1
tormented	1
by	1
self-reproach,	1
which	1
must	1
attend	1
her	1
through	1
life.	1
Surely	1
this	1
comparison	1
must	1
have	1
its	1
use	1
with	1
her.	1
She	1
will	1
feel	1
her	1
own	1
sufferings	1
to	1
be	1
nothing.	1
They	1
proceed	1
from	1
no	1
misconduct,	1
and	1
can	1
bring	1
no	1
disgrace.	1
On	1
the	1
contrary,	1
every	1
friend	1
must	1
be	1
made	1
still	1
more	1
her	1
friend	1
by	1
them.	1
Concern	1
for	1
her	1
unhappiness,	1
and	1
respect	1
for	1
her	1
fortitude	1
under	1
it,	1
must	1
strengthen	1
every	1
attachment.	1
Use	1
your	1
own	1
discretion,	1
however,	1
in	1
communicating	1
to	1
her	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
told	1
you.	1
You	1
must	1
know	1
best	1
what	1
will	1
be	1
its	1
effect;	1
but	1
had	1
I	1
not	1
seriously,	1
and	1
from	1
my	1
heart	1
believed	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
of	1
service,	1
might	1
lessen	1
her	1
regrets,	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
suffered	1
myself	1
to	1
trouble	1
you	1
with	1
this	1
account	1
of	1
my	1
family	1
afflictions,	1
with	1
a	1
recital	1
which	1
may	1
seem	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
intended	1
to	1
raise	1
myself	1
at	1
the	1
expense	1
of	1
others."	1
Elinor's	1
thanks	1
followed	1
this	1
speech	1
with	1
grateful	1
earnestness;	1
attended	1
too	1
with	1
the	1
assurance	1
of	1
her	1
expecting	1
material	1
advantage	1
to	1
Marianne,	1
from	1
the	1
communication	1
of	1
what	1
had	1
passed.	1
"I	1
have	1
been	1
more	1
pained,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"by	1
her	1
endeavors	1
to	1
acquit	1
him	1
than	1
by	1
all	1
the	1
rest;	1
for	1
it	1
irritates	1
her	1
mind	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
most	1
perfect	1
conviction	1
of	1
his	1
unworthiness	1
can	1
do.	1
Now,	1
though	1
at	1
first	1
she	1
will	1
suffer	1
much,	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
she	1
will	1
soon	1
become	1
easier.	1
Have	1
you,"	1
she	1
continued,	1
after	1
a	1
short	1
silence,	1
"ever	1
seen	1
Mr.	1
Willoughby	1
since	1
you	1
left	1
him	1
at	1
Barton?"	1
"Yes,"	1
he	1
replied	1
gravely,	1
"once	1
I	1
have.	1
One	1
meeting	1
was	1
unavoidable."	1
Elinor,	1
startled	1
by	1
his	1
manner,	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
anxiously,	1
saying,	1
"What?	1
have	1
you	1
met	1
him	1
to--"	1
"I	1
could	1
meet	1
him	1
no	1
other	1
way.	1
Eliza	1
had	1
confessed	1
to	1
me,	1
though	1
most	1
reluctantly,	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
her	1
lover;	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
returned	1
to	1
town,	1
which	1
was	1
within	1
a	1
fortnight	1
after	1
myself,	1
we	1
met	1
by	1
appointment,	1
he	1
to	1
defend,	1
I	1
to	1
punish	1
his	1
conduct.	1
We	1
returned	1
unwounded,	1
and	1
the	1
meeting,	1
therefore,	1
never	1
got	1
abroad."	1
Elinor	1
sighed	1
over	1
the	1
fancied	1
necessity	1
of	1
this;	1
but	1
to	1
a	1
man	1
and	1
a	1
soldier	1
she	1
presumed	1
not	1
to	1
censure	1
it.	1
"Such,"	1
said	1
Colonel	1
Brandon,	1
after	1
a	1
pause,	1
"has	1
been	1
the	1
unhappy	1
resemblance	1
between	1
the	1
fate	1
of	1
mother	1
and	1
daughter!	1
and	1
so	1
imperfectly	1
have	1
I	1
discharged	1
my	1
trust!"	1
"Is	1
she	1
still	1
in	1
town?"	1
"No;	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
recovered	1
from	1
her	1
lying-in,	1
for	1
I	1
found	1
her	1
near	1
her	1
delivery,	1
I	1
removed	1
her	1
and	1
her	1
child	1
into	1
the	1
country,	1
and	1
there	1
she	1
remains."	1
Recollecting,	1
soon	1
afterwards,	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
probably	1
dividing	1
Elinor	1
from	1
her	1
sister,	1
he	1
put	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
his	1
visit,	1
receiving	1
from	1
her	1
again	1
the	1
same	1
grateful	1
acknowledgments,	1
and	1
leaving	1
her	1
full	1
of	1
compassion	1
and	1
esteem	1
for	1
him.	1
CHAPTER	1
32	1
When	1
the	1
particulars	1
of	1
this	1
conversation	1
were	1
repeated	1
by	1
Miss	1
Dashwood	1
to	1
her	1
sister,	1
as	1
they	1
very	1
soon	1
were,	1
the	1
effect	1
on	1
her	1
was	1
not	1
entirely	1
such	1
as	1
the	1
former	1
had	1
hoped	1
to	1
see.	1
Not	1
that	1
Marianne	1
appeared	1
to	1
distrust	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
any	1
part	1
of	1
it,	1
for	1
she	1
listened	1
to	1
it	1
all	1
with	1
the	1
most	1
steady	1
and	1
submissive	1
attention,	1
made	1
neither	1
objection	1
nor	1
remark,	1
attempted	1
no	1
vindication	1
of	1
Willoughby,	1
and	1
seemed	1
to	1
shew	1
by	1
her	1
tears	1
that	1
she	1
felt	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
impossible.	1
But	1
though	1
this	1
behaviour	1
assured	1
Elinor	1
that	1
the	1
conviction	1
of	1
this	1
guilt	1
WAS	1
carried	1
home	1
to	1
her	1
mind,	1
though	1
she	1
saw	1
with	1
satisfaction	1
the	1
effect	1
of	1
it,	1
in	1
her	1
no	1
longer	1
avoiding	1
Colonel	1
Brandon	1
when	1
he	1
called,	1
in	1
her	1
speaking	1
to	1
him,	1
even	1
voluntarily	1
speaking,	1
with	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
compassionate	1
respect,	1
and	1
though	1
she	1
saw	1
her	1
spirits	1
less	1
violently	1
irritated	1
than	1
before,	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
her	1
less	1
wretched.	1
Her	1
mind	1
did	1
become	1
settled,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
settled	1
in	1
a	1
gloomy	1
dejection.	1
She	1
felt	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
Willoughby's	1
character	1
yet	1
more	1
heavily	1
than	1
she	1
had	1
felt	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
his	1
heart;	1
his	1
seduction	1
and	1
desertion	1
of	1
Miss	1
Williams,	1
the	1
misery	1
of	1
that	1
poor	1
girl,	1
and	1
the	1
doubt	1
of	1
what	1
his	1
designs	1
might	1
ONCE	1
have	1
been	1
on	1
herself,	1
preyed	1
altogether	1
so	1
much	1
on	1
her	1
spirits,	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
bring	1
herself	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
what	1
she	1
felt	1
even	1
to	1
Elinor;	1
and,	1
brooding	1
over	1
her	1
sorrows	1
in	1
silence,	1
gave	1
more	1
pain	1
to	1
her	1
sister	1
than	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
communicated	1
by	1
the	1
most	1
open	1
and	1
most	1
frequent	1
confession	1
of	1
them.	1
To	1
give	1
the	1
feelings	1
or	1
the	1
language	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood	1
on	1
receiving	1
and	1
answering	1
Elinor's	1
letter	1
would	1
be	1
only	1
to	1
give	1
a	1
repetition	1
of	1
what	1
her	1
daughters	1
had	1
already	1
felt	1
and	1
said;	1
of	1
a	1
disappointment	1
hardly	1
less	1
painful	1
than	1
Marianne's,	1
and	1
an	1
indignation	1
even	1
greater	1
than	1
Elinor's.	1
Long	1
letters	1
from	1
her,	1
quickly	1
succeeding	1
each	1
other,	1
arrived	1
to	1
tell	1
all	1
that	1
she	1
suffered	1
and	1
thought;	1
to	1
express	1
her	1
anxious	1
solicitude	1
for	1
Marianne,	1
and	1
entreat	1
she	1
would	1
bear	1
up	1
with	1
fortitude	1
under	1
this	1
misfortune.	1
Bad	1
indeed	1
must	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
Marianne's	1
affliction	1
be,	1
when	1
her	1
mother	1
could	1
talk	1
of	1
fortitude!	1
mortifying	1
and	1
humiliating	1
must	1
be	1
the	1
origin	1
of	1
those	1
regrets,	1
which	1
SHE	1
could	1
wish	1
her	1
not	1
to	1
indulge!	1
Against	1
the	1
interest	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
individual	1
comfort,	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood	1
had	1
determined	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
better	1
for	1
Marianne	1
to	1
be	1
any	1
where,	1
at	1
that	1
time,	1
than	1
at	1
Barton,	1
where	1
every	1
thing	1
within	1
her	1
view	1
would	1
be	1
bringing	1
back	1
the	1
past	1
in	1
the	1
strongest	1
and	1
most	1
afflicting	1
manner,	1
by	1
constantly	1
placing	1
Willoughby	1
before	1
her,	1
such	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
always	1
seen	1
him	1
there.	1
She	1
recommended	1
it	1
to	1
her	1
daughters,	1
therefore,	1
by	1
all	1
means	1
not	1
to	1
shorten	1
their	1
visit	1
to	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings;	1
the	1
length	1
of	1
which,	1
though	1
never	1
exactly	1
fixed,	1
had	1
been	1
expected	1
by	1
all	1
to	1
comprise	1
at	1
least	1
five	1
or	1
six	1
weeks.	1
A	1
variety	1
of	1
occupations,	1
of	1
objects,	1
and	1
of	1
company,	1
which	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
procured	1
at	1
Barton,	1
would	1
be	1
inevitable	1
there,	1
and	1
might	1
yet,	1
she	1
hoped,	1
cheat	1
Marianne,	1
at	1
times,	1
into	1
some	1
interest	1
beyond	1
herself,	1
and	1
even	1
into	1
some	1
amusement,	1
much	1
as	1
the	1
ideas	1
of	1
both	1
might	1
now	1
be	1
spurned	1
by	1
her.	1
From	1
all	1
danger	1
of	1
seeing	1
Willoughby	1
again,	1
her	1
mother	1
considered	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
least	1
equally	1
safe	1
in	1
town	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
country,	1
since	1
his	1
acquaintance	1
must	1
now	1
be	1
dropped	1
by	1
all	1
who	1
called	1
themselves	1
her	1
friends.	1
Design	1
could	1
never	1
bring	1
them	1
in	1
each	1
other's	1
way:	1
negligence	1
could	1
never	1
leave	1
them	1
exposed	1
to	1
a	1
surprise;	1
and	1
chance	1
had	1
less	1
in	1
its	1
favour	1
in	1
the	1
crowd	1
of	1
London	1
than	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
retirement	1
of	1
Barton,	1
where	1
it	1
might	1
force	1
him	1
before	1
her	1
while	1
paying	1
that	1
visit	1
at	1
Allenham	1
on	1
his	1
marriage,	1
which	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood,	1
from	1
foreseeing	1
at	1
first	1
as	1
a	1
probable	1
event,	1
had	1
brought	1
herself	1
to	1
expect	1
as	1
a	1
certain	1
one.	1
She	1
had	1
yet	1
another	1
reason	1
for	1
wishing	1
her	1
children	1
to	1
remain	1
where	1
they	1
were;	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
her	1
son-in-law	1
had	1
told	1
her	1
that	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
town	1
before	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
February,	1
and	1
she	1
judged	1
it	1
right	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
sometimes	1
see	1
their	1
brother.	1
Marianne	1
had	1
promised	1
to	1
be	1
guided	1
by	1
her	1
mother's	1
opinion,	1
and	1
she	1
submitted	1
to	1
it	1
therefore	1
without	1
opposition,	1
though	1
it	1
proved	1
perfectly	1
different	1
from	1
what	1
she	1
wished	1
and	1
expected,	1
though	1
she	1
felt	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
entirely	1
wrong,	1
formed	1
on	1
mistaken	1
grounds,	1
and	1
that	1
by	1
requiring	1
her	1
longer	1
continuance	1
in	1
London	1
it	1
deprived	1
her	1
of	1
the	1
only	1
possible	1
alleviation	1
of	1
her	1
wretchedness,	1
the	1
personal	1
sympathy	1
of	1
her	1
mother,	1
and	1
doomed	1
her	1
to	1
such	1
society	1
and	1
such	1
scenes	1
as	1
must	1
prevent	1
her	1
ever	1
knowing	1
a	1
moment's	1
rest.	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
great	1
consolation	1
to	1
her,	1
that	1
what	1
brought	1
evil	1
to	1
herself	1
would	1
bring	1
good	1
to	1
her	1
sister;	1
and	1
Elinor,	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
hand,	1
suspecting	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
in	1
her	1
power	1
to	1
avoid	1
Edward	1
entirely,	1
comforted	1
herself	1
by	1
thinking,	1
that	1
though	1
their	1
longer	1
stay	1
would	1
therefore	1
militate	1
against	1
her	1
own	1
happiness,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
better	1
for	1
Marianne	1
than	1
an	1
immediate	1
return	1
into	1
Devonshire.	1
Her	1
carefulness	1
in	1
guarding	1
her	1
sister	1
from	1
ever	1
hearing	1
Willoughby's	1
name	1
mentioned,	1
was	1
not	1
thrown	1
away.	1
Marianne,	1
though	1
without	1
knowing	1
it	1
herself,	1
reaped	1
all	1
its	1
advantage;	1
for	1
neither	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings,	1
nor	1
Sir	1
John,	1
nor	1
even	1
Mrs.	1
Palmer	1
herself,	1
ever	1
spoke	1
of	1
him	1
before	1
her.	1
Elinor	1
wished	1
that	1
the	1
same	1
forbearance	1
could	1
have	1
extended	1
towards	1
herself,	1
but	1
that	1
was	1
impossible,	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
listen	1
day	1
after	1
day	1
to	1
the	1
indignation	1
of	1
them	1
all.	1
Sir	1
John,	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
thought	1
it	1
possible.	1
"A	1
man	1
of	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
always	1
had	1
such	1
reason	1
to	1
think	1
well!	1
Such	1
a	1
good-natured	1
fellow!	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
believe	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
bolder	1
rider	1
in	1
England!	1
It	1
was	1
an	1
unaccountable	1
business.	1
He	1
wished	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
devil	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
heart.	1
He	1
would	1
not	1
speak	1
another	1
word	1
to	1
him,	1
meet	1
him	1
where	1
he	1
might,	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
world!	1
No,	1
not	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
by	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
Barton	1
covert,	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
kept	1
watching	1
for	1
two	1
hours	1
together.	1
Such	1
a	1
scoundrel	1
of	1
a	1
fellow!	1
such	1
a	1
deceitful	1
dog!	1
It	1
was	1
only	1
the	1
last	1
time	1
they	1
met	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
offered	1
him	1
one	1
of	1
Folly's	1
puppies!	1
and	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
it!"	1
Mrs.	1
Palmer,	1
in	1
her	1
way,	1
was	1
equally	1
angry.	1
"She	1
was	1
determined	1
to	1
drop	1
his	1
acquaintance	1
immediately,	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
very	1
thankful	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
acquainted	1
with	1
him	1
at	1
all.	1
She	1
wished	1
with	1
all	1
her	1
heart	1
Combe	1
Magna	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
near	1
Cleveland;	1
but	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
signify,	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
too	1
far	1
off	1
to	1
visit;	1
she	1
hated	1
him	1
so	1
much	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
resolved	1
never	1
to	1
mention	1
his	1
name	1
again,	1
and	1
she	1
should	1
tell	1
everybody	1
she	1
saw,	1
how	1
good-for-nothing	1
he	1
was."	1
The	1
rest	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
Palmer's	1
sympathy	1
was	1
shewn	1
in	1
procuring	1
all	1
the	1
particulars	1
in	1
her	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
approaching	1
marriage,	1
and	1
communicating	1
them	1
to	1
Elinor.	1
She	1
could	1
soon	1
tell	1
at	1
what	1
coachmaker's	1
the	1
new	1
carriage	1
was	1
building,	1
by	1
what	1
painter	1
Mr.	1
Willoughby's	1
portrait	1
was	1
drawn,	1
and	1
at	1
what	1
warehouse	1
Miss	1
Grey's	1
clothes	1
might	1
be	1
seen.	1
The	1
calm	1
and	1
polite	1
unconcern	1
of	1
Lady	1
Middleton	1
on	1
the	1
occasion	1
was	1
a	1
happy	1
relief	1
to	1
Elinor's	1
spirits,	1
oppressed	1
as	1
they	1
often	1
were	1
by	1
the	1
clamorous	1
kindness	1
of	1
the	1
others.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
comfort	1
to	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
sure	1
of	1
exciting	1
no	1
interest	1
in	1
ONE	1
person	1
at	1
least	1
among	1
their	1
circle	1
of	1
friends:	1
a	1
great	1
comfort	1
to	1
know	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
ONE	1
who	1
would	1
meet	1
her	1
without	1
feeling	1
any	1
curiosity	1
after	1
particulars,	1
or	1
any	1
anxiety	1
for	1
her	1
sister's	1
health.	1
Every	1
qualification	1
is	1
raised	1
at	1
times,	1
by	1
the	1
circumstances	1
of	1
the	1
moment,	1
to	1
more	1
than	1
its	1
real	1
value;	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
sometimes	1
worried	1
down	1
by	1
officious	1
condolence	1
to	1
rate	1
good-breeding	1
as	1
more	1
indispensable	1
to	1
comfort	1
than	1
good-nature.	1
Lady	1
Middleton	1
expressed	1
her	1
sense	1
of	1
the	1
affair	1
about	1
once	1
every	1
day,	1
or	1
twice,	1
if	1
the	1
subject	1
occurred	1
very	1
often,	1
by	1
saying,	1
"It	1
is	1
very	1
shocking,	1
indeed!"	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
this	1
continual	1
though	1
gentle	1
vent,	1
was	1
able	1
not	1
only	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
Miss	1
Dashwoods	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
without	1
the	1
smallest	1
emotion,	1
but	1
very	1
soon	1
to	1
see	1
them	1
without	1
recollecting	1
a	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
matter;	1
and	1
having	1
thus	1
supported	1
the	1
dignity	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
sex,	1
and	1
spoken	1
her	1
decided	1
censure	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
wrong	1
in	1
the	1
other,	1
she	1
thought	1
herself	1
at	1
liberty	1
to	1
attend	1
to	1
the	1
interest	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
assemblies,	1
and	1
therefore	1
determined	1
(though	1
rather	1
against	1
the	1
opinion	1
of	1
Sir	1
John)	1
that	1
as	1
Mrs.	1
Willoughby	1
would	1
at	1
once	1
be	1
a	1
woman	1
of	1
elegance	1
and	1
fortune,	1
to	1
leave	1
her	1
card	1
with	1
her	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
married.	1
Colonel	1
Brandon's	1
delicate,	1
unobtrusive	1
enquiries	1
were	1
never	1
unwelcome	1
to	1
Miss	1
Dashwood.	1
He	1
had	1
abundantly	1
earned	1
the	1
privilege	1
of	1
intimate	1
discussion	1
of	1
her	1
sister's	1
disappointment,	1
by	1
the	1
friendly	1
zeal	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
soften	1
it,	1
and	1
they	1
always	1
conversed	1
with	1
confidence.	1
His	1
chief	1
reward	1
for	1
the	1
painful	1
exertion	1
of	1
disclosing	1
past	1
sorrows	1
and	1
present	1
humiliations,	1
was	1
given	1
in	1
the	1
pitying	1
eye	1
with	1
which	1
Marianne	1
sometimes	1
observed	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
gentleness	1
of	1
her	1
voice	1
whenever	1
(though	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
often	1
happen)	1
she	1
was	1
obliged,	1
or	1
could	1
oblige	1
herself	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
him.	1
THESE	1
assured	1
him	1
that	1
his	1
exertion	1
had	1
produced	1
an	1
increase	1
of	1
good-will	1
towards	1
himself,	1
and	1
THESE	1
gave	1
Elinor	1
hopes	1
of	1
its	1
being	1
farther	1
augmented	1
hereafter;	1
but	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings,	1
who	1
knew	1
nothing	1
of	1
all	1
this,	1
who	1
knew	1
only	1
that	1
the	1
Colonel	1
continued	1
as	1
grave	1
as	1
ever,	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
neither	1
prevail	1
on	1
him	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
offer	1
himself,	1
nor	1
commission	1
her	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
for	1
him,	1
began,	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
two	1
days,	1
to	1
think	1
that,	1
instead	1
of	1
Midsummer,	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
married	1
till	1
Michaelmas,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
a	1
week	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
a	1
match	1
at	1
all.	1
The	1
good	1
understanding	1
between	1
the	1
Colonel	1
and	1
Miss	1
Dashwood	1
seemed	1
rather	1
to	1
declare	1
that	1
the	1
honours	1
of	1
the	1
mulberry-tree,	1
the	1
canal,	1
and	1
the	1
yew	1
arbour,	1
would	1
all	1
be	1
made	1
over	1
to	1
HER;	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
had,	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
ceased	1
to	1
think	1
at	1
all	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
Ferrars.	1
Early	1
in	1
February,	1
within	1
a	1
fortnight	1
from	1
the	1
receipt	1
of	1
Willoughby's	1
letter,	1
Elinor	1
had	1
the	1
painful	1
office	1
of	1
informing	1
her	1
sister	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
married.	1
She	1
had	1
taken	1
care	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
intelligence	1
conveyed	1
to	1
herself,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
known	1
that	1
the	1
ceremony	1
was	1
over,	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
desirous	1
that	1
Marianne	1
should	1
not	1
receive	1
the	1
first	1
notice	1
of	1
it	1
from	1
the	1
public	1
papers,	1
which	1
she	1
saw	1
her	1
eagerly	1
examining	1
every	1
morning.	1
She	1
received	1
the	1
news	1
with	1
resolute	1
composure;	1
made	1
no	1
observation	1
on	1
it,	1
and	1
at	1
first	1
shed	1
no	1
tears;	1
but	1
after	1
a	1
short	1
time	1
they	1
would	1
burst	1
out,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
day,	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
hardly	1
less	1
pitiable	1
than	1
when	1
she	1
first	1
learnt	1
to	1
expect	1
the	1
event.	1
The	1
Willoughbys	1
left	1
town	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
married;	1
and	1
Elinor	1
now	1
hoped,	1
as	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
no	1
danger	1
of	1
her	1
seeing	1
either	1
of	1
them,	1
to	1
prevail	1
on	1
her	1
sister,	1
who	1
had	1
never	1
yet	1
left	1
the	1
house	1
since	1
the	1
blow	1
first	1
fell,	1
to	1
go	1
out	1
again	1
by	1
degrees	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
done	1
before.	1
About	1
this	1
time	1
the	1
two	1
Miss	1
Steeles,	1
lately	1
arrived	1
at	1
their	1
cousin's	1
house	1
in	1
Bartlett's	1
Buildings,	1
Holburn,	1
presented	1
themselves	1
again	1
before	1
their	1
more	1
grand	1
relations	1
in	1
Conduit	1
and	1
Berkeley	1
Streets;	1
and	1
were	1
welcomed	1
by	1
them	1
all	1
with	1
great	1
cordiality.	1
Elinor	1
only	1
was	1
sorry	1
to	1
see	1
them.	1
Their	1
presence	1
always	1
gave	1
her	1
pain,	1
and	1
she	1
hardly	1
knew	1
how	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
very	1
gracious	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
overpowering	1
delight	1
of	1
Lucy	1
in	1
finding	1
her	1
STILL	1
in	1
town.	1
"I	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
quite	1
disappointed	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
found	1
you	1
here	1
STILL,"	1
said	1
she	1
repeatedly,	1
with	1
a	1
strong	1
emphasis	1
on	1
the	1
word.	1
"But	1
I	1
always	1
thought	1
I	1
SHOULD.	1
I	1
was	1
almost	1
sure	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
leave	1
London	1
yet	1
awhile;	1
though	1
you	1
TOLD	1
me,	1
you	1
know,	1
at	1
Barton,	1
that	1
you	1
should	1
not	1
stay	1
above	1
a	1
MONTH.	1
But	1
I	1
thought,	1
at	1
the	1
time,	1
that	1
you	1
would	1
most	1
likely	1
change	1
your	1
mind	1
when	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
point.	1
It	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
such	1
a	1
great	1
pity	1
to	1
have	1
went	1
away	1
before	1
your	1
brother	1
and	1
sister	1
came.	1
And	1
now	1
to	1
be	1
sure	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
in	1
no	1
hurry	1
to	1
be	1
gone.	1
I	1
am	1
amazingly	1
glad	1
you	1
did	1
not	1
keep	1
to	1
YOUR	1
WORD."	1
Elinor	1
perfectly	1
understood	1
her,	1
and	1
was	1
forced	1
to	1
use	1
all	1
her	1
self-command	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
appear	1
that	1
she	1
did	1
NOT.	1
"Well,	1
my	1
dear,"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings,	1
"and	1
how	1
did	1
you	1
travel?"	1
"Not	1
in	1
the	1
stage,	1
I	1
assure	1
you,"	1
replied	1
Miss	1
Steele,	1
with	1
quick	1
exultation;	1
"we	1
came	1
post	1
all	1
the	1
way,	1
and	1
had	1
a	1
very	1
smart	1
beau	1
to	1
attend	1
us.	1
Dr.	1
Davies	1
was	1
coming	1
to	1
town,	1
and	1
so	1
we	1
thought	1
we'd	1
join	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
post-chaise;	1
and	1
he	1
behaved	1
very	1
genteelly,	1
and	1
paid	1
ten	1
or	1
twelve	1
shillings	1
more	1
than	1
we	1
did."	1
"Oh,	1
oh!"	1
cried	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings;	1
"very	1
pretty,	1
indeed!	1
and	1
the	1
Doctor	1
is	1
a	1
single	1
man,	1
I	1
warrant	1
you."	1
"There	1
now,"	1
said	1
Miss	1
Steele,	1
affectedly	1
simpering,	1
"everybody	1
laughs	1
at	1
me	1
so	1
about	1
the	1
Doctor,	1
and	1
I	1
cannot	1
think	1
why.	1
My	1
cousins	1
say	1
they	1
are	1
sure	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
a	1
conquest;	1
but	1
for	1
my	1
part	1
I	1
declare	1
I	1
never	1
think	1
about	1
him	1
from	1
one	1
hour's	1
end	1
to	1
another.	1
'Lord!	1
here	1
comes	1
your	1
beau,	1
Nancy,'	1
my	1
cousin	1
said	1
t'other	1
day,	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
him	1
crossing	1
the	1
street	1
to	1
the	1
house.	1
My	1
beau,	1
indeed!	1
said	1
I--I	1
cannot	1
think	1
who	1
you	1
mean.	1
The	1
Doctor	1
is	1
no	1
beau	1
of	1
mine."	1
"Aye,	1
aye,	1
that	1
is	1
very	1
pretty	1
talking--but	1
it	1
won't	1
do--	1
the	1
Doctor	1
is	1
the	1
man,	1
I	1
see."	1
"No,	1
indeed!"	1
replied	1
her	1
cousin,	1
with	1
affected	1
earnestness,	1
"and	1
I	1
beg	1
you	1
will	1
contradict	1
it,	1
if	1
you	1
ever	1
hear	1
it	1
talked	1
of."	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
directly	1
gave	1
her	1
the	1
gratifying	1
assurance	1
that	1
she	1
certainly	1
would	1
NOT,	1
and	1
Miss	1
Steele	1
was	1
made	1
completely	1
happy.	1
"I	1
suppose	1
you	1
will	1
go	1
and	1
stay	1
with	1
your	1
brother	1
and	1
sister,	1
Miss	1
Dashwood,	1
when	1
they	1
come	1
to	1
town,"	1
said	1
Lucy,	1
returning,	1
after	1
a	1
cessation	1
of	1
hostile	1
hints,	1
to	1
the	1
charge.	1
"No,	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
we	1
shall."	1
"Oh,	1
yes,	1
I	1
dare	1
say	1
you	1
will."	1
Elinor	1
would	1
not	1
humour	1
her	1
by	1
farther	1
opposition.	1
"What	1
a	1
charming	1
thing	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood	1
can	1
spare	1
you	1
both	1
for	1
so	1
long	1
a	1
time	1
together!"	1
"Long	1
a	1
time,	1
indeed!"	1
interposed	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings.	1
"Why,	1
their	1
visit	1
is	1
but	1
just	1
begun!"	1
Lucy	1
was	1
silenced.	1
"I	1
am	1
sorry	1
we	1
cannot	1
see	1
your	1
sister,	1
Miss	1
Dashwood,"	1
said	1
Miss	1
Steele.	1
"I	1
am	1
sorry	1
she	1
is	1
not	1
well--"	1
for	1
Marianne	1
had	1
left	1
the	1
room	1
on	1
their	1
arrival.	1
"You	1
are	1
very	1
good.	1
My	1
sister	1
will	1
be	1
equally	1
sorry	1
to	1
miss	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
seeing	1
you;	1
but	1
she	1
has	1
been	1
very	1
much	1
plagued	1
lately	1
with	1
nervous	1
head-aches,	1
which	1
make	1
her	1
unfit	1
for	1
company	1
or	1
conversation."	1
"Oh,	1
dear,	1
that	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
pity!	1
but	1
such	1
old	1
friends	1
as	1
Lucy	1
and	1
me!--I	1
think	1
she	1
might	1
see	1
US;	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
we	1
would	1
not	1
speak	1
a	1
word."	1
Elinor,	1
with	1
great	1
civility,	1
declined	1
the	1
proposal.	1
Her	1
sister	1
was	1
perhaps	1
laid	1
down	1
upon	1
the	1
bed,	1
or	1
in	1
her	1
dressing	1
gown,	1
and	1
therefore	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
them.	1
"Oh,	1
if	1
that's	1
all,"	1
cried	1
Miss	1
Steele,	1
"we	1
can	1
just	1
as	1
well	1
go	1
and	1
see	1
HER."	1
Elinor	1
began	1
to	1
find	1
this	1
impertinence	1
too	1
much	1
for	1
her	1
temper;	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
saved	1
the	1
trouble	1
of	1
checking	1
it,	1
by	1
Lucy's	1
sharp	1
reprimand,	1
which	1
now,	1
as	1
on	1
many	1
occasions,	1
though	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
give	1
much	1
sweetness	1
to	1
the	1
manners	1
of	1
one	1
sister,	1
was	1
of	1
advantage	1
in	1
governing	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
other.	1
CHAPTER	1
33	1
After	1
some	1
opposition,	1
Marianne	1
yielded	1
to	1
her	1
sister's	1
entreaties,	1
and	1
consented	1
to	1
go	1
out	1
with	1
her	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
one	1
morning	1
for	1
half	1
an	1
hour.	1
She	1
expressly	1
conditioned,	1
however,	1
for	1
paying	1
no	1
visits,	1
and	1
would	1
do	1
no	1
more	1
than	1
accompany	1
them	1
to	1
Gray's	1
in	1
Sackville	1
Street,	1
where	1
Elinor	1
was	1
carrying	1
on	1
a	1
negotiation	1
for	1
the	1
exchange	1
of	1
a	1
few	1
old-fashioned	1
jewels	1
of	1
her	1
mother.	1
When	1
they	1
stopped	1
at	1
the	1
door,	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
recollected	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
lady	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
street	1
on	1
whom	1
she	1
ought	1
to	1
call;	1
and	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
business	1
at	1
Gray's,	1
it	1
was	1
resolved,	1
that	1
while	1
her	1
young	1
friends	1
transacted	1
their's,	1
she	1
should	1
pay	1
her	1
visit	1
and	1
return	1
for	1
them.	1
On	1
ascending	1
the	1
stairs,	1
the	1
Miss	1
Dashwoods	1
found	1
so	1
many	1
people	1
before	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
room,	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
person	1
at	1
liberty	1
to	1
tend	1
to	1
their	1
orders;	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
obliged	1
to	1
wait.	1
All	1
that	1
could	1
be	1
done	1
was,	1
to	1
sit	1
down	1
at	1
that	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
counter	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
promise	1
the	1
quickest	1
succession;	1
one	1
gentleman	1
only	1
was	1
standing	1
there,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
probable	1
that	1
Elinor	1
was	1
not	1
without	1
hope	1
of	1
exciting	1
his	1
politeness	1
to	1
a	1
quicker	1
despatch.	1
But	1
the	1
correctness	1
of	1
his	1
eye,	1
and	1
the	1
delicacy	1
of	1
his	1
taste,	1
proved	1
to	1
be	1
beyond	1
his	1
politeness.	1
He	1
was	1
giving	1
orders	1
for	1
a	1
toothpick-case	1
for	1
himself,	1
and	1
till	1
its	1
size,	1
shape,	1
and	1
ornaments	1
were	1
determined,	1
all	1
of	1
which,	1
after	1
examining	1
and	1
debating	1
for	1
a	1
quarter	1
of	1
an	1
hour	1
over	1
every	1
toothpick-case	1
in	1
the	1
shop,	1
were	1
finally	1
arranged	1
by	1
his	1
own	1
inventive	1
fancy,	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
leisure	1
to	1
bestow	1
any	1
other	1
attention	1
on	1
the	1
two	1
ladies,	1
than	1
what	1
was	1
comprised	1
in	1
three	1
or	1
four	1
very	1
broad	1
stares;	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
notice	1
which	1
served	1
to	1
imprint	1
on	1
Elinor	1
the	1
remembrance	1
of	1
a	1
person	1
and	1
face,	1
of	1
strong,	1
natural,	1
sterling	1
insignificance,	1
though	1
adorned	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
style	1
of	1
fashion.	1
Marianne	1
was	1
spared	1
from	1
the	1
troublesome	1
feelings	1
of	1
contempt	1
and	1
resentment,	1
on	1
this	1
impertinent	1
examination	1
of	1
their	1
features,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
puppyism	1
of	1
his	1
manner	1
in	1
deciding	1
on	1
all	1
the	1
different	1
horrors	1
of	1
the	1
different	1
toothpick-cases	1
presented	1
to	1
his	1
inspection,	1
by	1
remaining	1
unconscious	1
of	1
it	1
all;	1
for	1
she	1
was	1
as	1
well	1
able	1
to	1
collect	1
her	1
thoughts	1
within	1
herself,	1
and	1
be	1
as	1
ignorant	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
passing	1
around	1
her,	1
in	1
Mr.	1
Gray's	1
shop,	1
as	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
bedroom.	1
At	1
last	1
the	1
affair	1
was	1
decided.	1
The	1
ivory,	1
the	1
gold,	1
and	1
the	1
pearls,	1
all	1
received	1
their	1
appointment,	1
and	1
the	1
gentleman	1
having	1
named	1
the	1
last	1
day	1
on	1
which	1
his	1
existence	1
could	1
be	1
continued	1
without	1
the	1
possession	1
of	1
the	1
toothpick-case,	1
drew	1
on	1
his	1
gloves	1
with	1
leisurely	1
care,	1
and	1
bestowing	1
another	1
glance	1
on	1
the	1
Miss	1
Dashwoods,	1
but	1
such	1
a	1
one	1
as	1
seemed	1
rather	1
to	1
demand	1
than	1
express	1
admiration,	1
walked	1
off	1
with	1
a	1
happy	1
air	1
of	1
real	1
conceit	1
and	1
affected	1
indifference.	1
Elinor	1
lost	1
no	1
time	1
in	1
bringing	1
her	1
business	1
forward,	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
concluding	1
it,	1
when	1
another	1
gentleman	1
presented	1
himself	1
at	1
her	1
side.	1
She	1
turned	1
her	1
eyes	1
towards	1
his	1
face,	1
and	1
found	1
him	1
with	1
some	1
surprise	1
to	1
be	1
her	1
brother.	1
Their	1
affection	1
and	1
pleasure	1
in	1
meeting	1
was	1
just	1
enough	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
very	1
creditable	1
appearance	1
in	1
Mr.	1
Gray's	1
shop.	1
John	1
Dashwood	1
was	1
really	1
far	1
from	1
being	1
sorry	1
to	1
see	1
his	1
sisters	1
again;	1
it	1
rather	1
gave	1
them	1
satisfaction;	1
and	1
his	1
inquiries	1
after	1
their	1
mother	1
were	1
respectful	1
and	1
attentive.	1
Elinor	1
found	1
that	1
he	1
and	1
Fanny	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
town	1
two	1
days.	1
"I	1
wished	1
very	1
much	1
to	1
call	1
upon	1
you	1
yesterday,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"but	1
it	1
was	1
impossible,	1
for	1
we	1
were	1
obliged	1
to	1
take	1
Harry	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
wild	1
beasts	1
at	1
Exeter	1
Exchange;	1
and	1
we	1
spent	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
with	1
Mrs.	1
Ferrars.	1
Harry	1
was	1
vastly	1
pleased.	1
THIS	1
morning	1
I	1
had	1
fully	1
intended	1
to	1
call	1
on	1
you,	1
if	1
I	1
could	1
possibly	1
find	1
a	1
spare	1
half	1
hour,	1
but	1
one	1
has	1
always	1
so	1
much	1
to	1
do	1
on	1
first	1
coming	1
to	1
town.	1
I	1
am	1
come	1
here	1
to	1
bespeak	1
Fanny	1
a	1
seal.	1
But	1
tomorrow	1
I	1
think	1
I	1
shall	1
certainly	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
call	1
in	1
Berkeley	1
Street,	1
and	1
be	1
introduced	1
to	1
your	1
friend	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings.	1
I	1
understand	1
she	1
is	1
a	1
woman	1
of	1
very	1
good	1
fortune.	1
And	1
the	1
Middletons	1
too,	1
you	1
must	1
introduce	1
me	1
to	1
THEM.	1
As	1
my	1
mother-in-law's	1
relations,	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
happy	1
to	1
show	1
them	1
every	1
respect.	1
They	1
are	1
excellent	1
neighbours	1
to	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
country,	1
I	1
understand."	1
"Excellent	1
indeed.	1
Their	1
attention	1
to	1
our	1
comfort,	1
their	1
friendliness	1
in	1
every	1
particular,	1
is	1
more	1
than	1
I	1
can	1
express."	1
"I	1
am	1
extremely	1
glad	1
to	1
hear	1
it,	1
upon	1
my	1
word;	1
extremely	1
glad	1
indeed.	1
But	1
so	1
it	1
ought	1
to	1
be;	1
they	1
are	1
people	1
of	1
large	1
fortune,	1
they	1
are	1
related	1
to	1
you,	1
and	1
every	1
civility	1
and	1
accommodation	1
that	1
can	1
serve	1
to	1
make	1
your	1
situation	1
pleasant	1
might	1
be	1
reasonably	1
expected.	1
And	1
so	1
you	1
are	1
most	1
comfortably	1
settled	1
in	1
your	1
little	1
cottage	1
and	1
want	1
for	1
nothing!	1
Edward	1
brought	1
us	1
a	1
most	1
charming	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
place:	1
the	1
most	1
complete	1
thing	1
of	1
its	1
kind,	1
he	1
said,	1
that	1
ever	1
was,	1
and	1
you	1
all	1
seemed	1
to	1
enjoy	1
it	1
beyond	1
any	1
thing.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
satisfaction	1
to	1
us	1
to	1
hear	1
it,	1
I	1
assure	1
you."	1
Elinor	1
did	1
feel	1
a	1
little	1
ashamed	1
of	1
her	1
brother;	1
and	1
was	1
not	1
sorry	1
to	1
be	1
spared	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
answering	1
him,	1
by	1
the	1
arrival	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings's	1
servant,	1
who	1
came	1
to	1
tell	1
her	1
that	1
his	1
mistress	1
waited	1
for	1
them	1
at	1
the	1
door.	1
Mr.	1
Dashwood	1
attended	1
them	1
down	1
stairs,	1
was	1
introduced	1
to	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
her	1
carriage,	1
and	1
repeating	1
his	1
hope	1
of	1
being	1
able	1
to	1
call	1
on	1
them	1
the	1
next	1
day,	1
took	1
leave.	1
His	1
visit	1
was	1
duly	1
paid.	1
He	1
came	1
with	1
a	1
pretence	1
at	1
an	1
apology	1
from	1
their	1
sister-in-law,	1
for	1
not	1
coming	1
too;	1
"but	1
she	1
was	1
so	1
much	1
engaged	1
with	1
her	1
mother,	1
that	1
really	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
leisure	1
for	1
going	1
any	1
where."	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings,	1
however,	1
assured	1
him	1
directly,	1
that	1
she	1
should	1
not	1
stand	1
upon	1
ceremony,	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
cousins,	1
or	1
something	1
like	1
it,	1
and	1
she	1
should	1
certainly	1
wait	1
on	1
Mrs.	1
John	1
Dashwood	1
very	1
soon,	1
and	1
bring	1
her	1
sisters	1
to	1
see	1
her.	1
His	1
manners	1
to	1
THEM,	1
though	1
calm,	1
were	1
perfectly	1
kind;	1
to	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings,	1
most	1
attentively	1
civil;	1
and	1
on	1
Colonel	1
Brandon's	1
coming	1
in	1
soon	1
after	1
himself,	1
he	1
eyed	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
curiosity	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
say,	1
that	1
he	1
only	1
wanted	1
to	1
know	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
rich,	1
to	1
be	1
equally	1
civil	1
to	1
HIM.	1
After	1
staying	1
with	1
them	1
half	1
an	1
hour,	1
he	1
asked	1
Elinor	1
to	1
walk	1
with	1
him	1
to	1
Conduit	1
Street,	1
and	1
introduce	1
him	1
to	1
Sir	1
John	1
and	1
Lady	1
Middleton.	1
The	1
weather	1
was	1
remarkably	1
fine,	1
and	1
she	1
readily	1
consented.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
his	1
enquiries	1
began.	1
"Who	1
is	1
Colonel	1
Brandon?	1
Is	1
he	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
fortune?"	1
"Yes;	1
he	1
has	1
very	1
good	1
property	1
in	1
Dorsetshire."	1
"I	1
am	1
glad	1
of	1
it.	1
He	1
seems	1
a	1
most	1
gentlemanlike	1
man;	1
and	1
I	1
think,	1
Elinor,	1
I	1
may	1
congratulate	1
you	1
on	1
the	1
prospect	1
of	1
a	1
very	1
respectable	1
establishment	1
in	1
life."	1
"Me,	1
brother!	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
mean?"	1
"He	1
likes	1
you.	1
I	1
observed	1
him	1
narrowly,	1
and	1
am	1
convinced	1
of	1
it.	1
What	1
is	1
the	1
amount	1
of	1
his	1
fortune?"	1
"I	1
believe	1
about	1
two	1
thousand	1
a	1
year."	1
"Two	1
thousand	1
a-year;"	1
and	1
then	1
working	1
himself	1
up	1
to	1
a	1
pitch	1
of	1
enthusiastic	1
generosity,	1
he	1
added,	1
"Elinor,	1
I	1
wish	1
with	1
all	1
my	1
heart	1
it	1
were	1
TWICE	1
as	1
much,	1
for	1
your	1
sake."	1
"Indeed	1
I	1
believe	1
you,"	1
replied	1
Elinor;	1
"but	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
sure	1
that	1
Colonel	1
Brandon	1
has	1
not	1
the	1
smallest	1
wish	1
of	1
marrying	1
ME."	1
"You	1
are	1
mistaken,	1
Elinor;	1
you	1
are	1
very	1
much	1
mistaken.	1
A	1
very	1
little	1
trouble	1
on	1
your	1
side	1
secures	1
him.	1
Perhaps	1
just	1
at	1
present	1
he	1
may	1
be	1
undecided;	1
the	1
smallness	1
of	1
your	1
fortune	1
may	1
make	1
him	1
hang	1
back;	1
his	1
friends	1
may	1
all	1
advise	1
him	1
against	1
it.	1
But	1
some	1
of	1
those	1
little	1
attentions	1
and	1
encouragements	1
which	1
ladies	1
can	1
so	1
easily	1
give	1
will	1
fix	1
him,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
himself.	1
And	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
reason	1
why	1
you	1
should	1
not	1
try	1
for	1
him.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
supposed	1
that	1
any	1
prior	1
attachment	1
on	1
your	1
side--in	1
short,	1
you	1
know	1
as	1
to	1
an	1
attachment	1
of	1
that	1
kind,	1
it	1
is	1
quite	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
question,	1
the	1
objections	1
are	1
insurmountable--	1
you	1
have	1
too	1
much	1
sense	1
not	1
to	1
see	1
all	1
that.	1
Colonel	1
Brandon	1
must	1
be	1
the	1
man;	1
and	1
no	1
civility	1
shall	1
be	1
wanting	1
on	1
my	1
part	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
pleased	1
with	1
you	1
and	1
your	1
family.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
match	1
that	1
must	1
give	1
universal	1
satisfaction.	1
In	1
short,	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
thing	1
that"--lowering	1
his	1
voice	1
to	1
an	1
important	1
whisper--"will	1
be	1
exceedingly	1
welcome	1
to	1
ALL	1
PARTIES."	1
Recollecting	1
himself,	1
however,	1
he	1
added,	1
"That	1
is,	1
I	1
mean	1
to	1
say--your	1
friends	1
are	1
all	1
truly	1
anxious	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
well	1
settled;	1
Fanny	1
particularly,	1
for	1
she	1
has	1
your	1
interest	1
very	1
much	1
at	1
heart,	1
I	1
assure	1
you.	1
And	1
her	1
mother	1
too,	1
Mrs.	1
Ferrars,	1
a	1
very	1
good-natured	1
woman,	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
it	1
would	1
give	1
her	1
great	1
pleasure;	1
she	1
said	1
as	1
much	1
the	1
other	1
day."	1
Elinor	1
would	1
not	1
vouchsafe	1
any	1
answer.	1
"It	1
would	1
be	1
something	1
remarkable,	1
now,"	1
he	1
continued,	1
"something	1
droll,	1
if	1
Fanny	1
should	1
have	1
a	1
brother	1
and	1
I	1
a	1
sister	1
settling	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time.	1
And	1
yet	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
very	1
unlikely."	1
"Is	1
Mr.	1
Edward	1
Ferrars,"	1
said	1
Elinor,	1
with	1
resolution,	1
"going	1
to	1
be	1
married?"	1
"It	1
is	1
not	1
actually	1
settled,	1
but	1
there	1
is	1
such	1
a	1
thing	1
in	1
agitation.	1
He	1
has	1
a	1
most	1
excellent	1
mother.	1
Mrs.	1
Ferrars,	1
with	1
the	1
utmost	1
liberality,	1
will	1
come	1
forward,	1
and	1
settle	1
on	1
him	1
a	1
thousand	1
a	1
year,	1
if	1
the	1
match	1
takes	1
place.	1
The	1
lady	1
is	1
the	1
Hon.	1
Miss	1
Morton,	1
only	1
daughter	1
of	1
the	1
late	1
Lord	1
Morton,	1
with	1
thirty	1
thousand	1
pounds.	1
A	1
very	1
desirable	1
connection	1
on	1
both	1
sides,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
a	1
doubt	1
of	1
its	1
taking	1
place	1
in	1
time.	1
A	1
thousand	1
a-year	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
for	1
a	1
mother	1
to	1
give	1
away,	1
to	1
make	1
over	1
for	1
ever;	1
but	1
Mrs.	1
Ferrars	1
has	1
a	1
noble	1
spirit.	1
To	1
give	1
you	1
another	1
instance	1
of	1
her	1
liberality:--The	1
other	1
day,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
we	1
came	1
to	1
town,	1
aware	1
that	1
money	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
very	1
plenty	1
with	1
us	1
just	1
now,	1
she	1
put	1
bank-notes	1
into	1
Fanny's	1
hands	1
to	1
the	1
amount	1
of	1
two	1
hundred	1
pounds.	1
And	1
extremely	1
acceptable	1
it	1
is,	1
for	1
we	1
must	1
live	1
at	1
a	1
great	1
expense	1
while	1
we	1
are	1
here."	1
He	1
paused	1
for	1
her	1
assent	1
and	1
compassion;	1
and	1
she	1
forced	1
herself	1
to	1
say,	1
"Your	1
expenses	1
both	1
in	1
town	1
and	1
country	1
must	1
certainly	1
be	1
considerable;	1
but	1
your	1
income	1
is	1
a	1
large	1
one."	1
"Not	1
so	1
large,	1
I	1
dare	1
say,	1
as	1
many	1
people	1
suppose.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
mean	1
to	1
complain,	1
however;	1
it	1
is	1
undoubtedly	1
a	1
comfortable	1
one,	1
and	1
I	1
hope	1
will	1
in	1
time	1
be	1
better.	1
The	1
enclosure	1
of	1
Norland	1
Common,	1
now	1
carrying	1
on,	1
is	1
a	1
most	1
serious	1
drain.	1
And	1
then	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
a	1
little	1
purchase	1
within	1
this	1
half	1
year;	1
East	1
Kingham	1
Farm,	1
you	1
must	1
remember	1
the	1
place,	1
where	1
old	1
Gibson	1
used	1
to	1
live.	1
The	1
land	1
was	1
so	1
very	1
desirable	1
for	1
me	1
in	1
every	1
respect,	1
so	1
immediately	1
adjoining	1
my	1
own	1
property,	1
that	1
I	1
felt	1
it	1
my	1
duty	1
to	1
buy	1
it.	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
answered	1
it	1
to	1
my	1
conscience	1
to	1
let	1
it	1
fall	1
into	1
any	1
other	1
hands.	1
A	1
man	1
must	1
pay	1
for	1
his	1
convenience;	1
and	1
it	1
HAS	1
cost	1
me	1
a	1
vast	1
deal	1
of	1
money."	1
"More	1
than	1
you	1
think	1
it	1
really	1
and	1
intrinsically	1
worth."	1
"Why,	1
I	1
hope	1
not	1
that.	1
I	1
might	1
have	1
sold	1
it	1
again,	1
the	1
next	1
day,	1
for	1
more	1
than	1
I	1
gave:	1
but,	1
with	1
regard	1
to	1
the	1
purchase-money,	1
I	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
very	1
unfortunate	1
indeed;	1
for	1
the	1
stocks	1
were	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
so	1
low,	1
that	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
happened	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
necessary	1
sum	1
in	1
my	1
banker's	1
hands,	1
I	1
must	1
have	1
sold	1
out	1
to	1
very	1
great	1
loss."	1
Elinor	1
could	1
only	1
smile.	1
"Other	1
great	1
and	1
inevitable	1
expenses	1
too	1
we	1
have	1
had	1
on	1
first	1
coming	1
to	1
Norland.	1
Our	1
respected	1
father,	1
as	1
you	1
well	1
know,	1
bequeathed	1
all	1
the	1
Stanhill	1
effects	1
that	1
remained	1
at	1
Norland	1
(and	1
very	1
valuable	1
they	1
were)	1
to	1
your	1
mother.	1
Far	1
be	1
it	1
from	1
me	1
to	1
repine	1
at	1
his	1
doing	1
so;	1
he	1
had	1
an	1
undoubted	1
right	1
to	1
dispose	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
property	1
as	1
he	1
chose,	1
but,	1
in	1
consequence	1
of	1
it,	1
we	1
have	1
been	1
obliged	1
to	1
make	1
large	1
purchases	1
of	1
linen,	1
china,	1
&c.	1
to	1
supply	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
taken	1
away.	1
You	1
may	1
guess,	1
after	1
all	1
these	1
expenses,	1
how	1
very	1
far	1
we	1
must	1
be	1
from	1
being	1
rich,	1
and	1
how	1
acceptable	1
Mrs.	1
Ferrars's	1
kindness	1
is."	1
"Certainly,"	1
said	1
Elinor;	1
"and	1
assisted	1
by	1
her	1
liberality,	1
I	1
hope	1
you	1
may	1
yet	1
live	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
easy	1
circumstances."	1
"Another	1
year	1
or	1
two	1
may	1
do	1
much	1
towards	1
it,"	1
he	1
gravely	1
replied;	1
"but	1
however	1
there	1
is	1
still	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
to	1
be	1
done.	1
There	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
stone	1
laid	1
of	1
Fanny's	1
green-house,	1
and	1
nothing	1
but	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
the	1
flower-garden	1
marked	1
out."	1
"Where	1
is	1
the	1
green-house	1
to	1
be?"	1
"Upon	1
the	1
knoll	1
behind	1
the	1
house.	1
The	1
old	1
walnut	1
trees	1
are	1
all	1
come	1
down	1
to	1
make	1
room	1
for	1
it.	1
It	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
very	1
fine	1
object	1
from	1
many	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
park,	1
and	1
the	1
flower-garden	1
will	1
slope	1
down	1
just	1
before	1
it,	1
and	1
be	1
exceedingly	1
pretty.	1
We	1
have	1
cleared	1
away	1
all	1
the	1
old	1
thorns	1
that	1
grew	1
in	1
patches	1
over	1
the	1
brow."	1
Elinor	1
kept	1
her	1
concern	1
and	1
her	1
censure	1
to	1
herself;	1
and	1
was	1
very	1
thankful	1
that	1
Marianne	1
was	1
not	1
present,	1
to	1
share	1
the	1
provocation.	1
Having	1
now	1
said	1
enough	1
to	1
make	1
his	1
poverty	1
clear,	1
and	1
to	1
do	1
away	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
buying	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
ear-rings	1
for	1
each	1
of	1
his	1
sisters,	1
in	1
his	1
next	1
visit	1
at	1
Gray's	1
his	1
thoughts	1
took	1
a	1
cheerfuller	1
turn,	1
and	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
congratulate	1
Elinor	1
on	1
having	1
such	1
a	1
friend	1
as	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings.	1
"She	1
seems	1
a	1
most	1
valuable	1
woman	1
indeed--Her	1
house,	1
her	1
style	1
of	1
living,	1
all	1
bespeak	1
an	1
exceeding	1
good	1
income;	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
an	1
acquaintance	1
that	1
has	1
not	1
only	1
been	1
of	1
great	1
use	1
to	1
you	1
hitherto,	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
end	1
may	1
prove	1
materially	1
advantageous.--Her	1
inviting	1
you	1
to	1
town	1
is	1
certainly	1
a	1
vast	1
thing	1
in	1
your	1
favour;	1
and	1
indeed,	1
it	1
speaks	1
altogether	1
so	1
great	1
a	1
regard	1
for	1
you,	1
that	1
in	1
all	1
probability	1
when	1
she	1
dies	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
forgotten.--	1
She	1
must	1
have	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
to	1
leave."	1
"Nothing	1
at	1
all,	1
I	1
should	1
rather	1
suppose;	1
for	1
she	1
has	1
only	1
her	1
jointure,	1
which	1
will	1
descend	1
to	1
her	1
children."	1
"But	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
imagined	1
that	1
she	1
lives	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
income.	1
Few	1
people	1
of	1
common	1
prudence	1
will	1
do	1
THAT;	1
and	1
whatever	1
she	1
saves,	1
she	1
will	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
dispose	1
of."	1
"And	1
do	1
you	1
not	1
think	1
it	1
more	1
likely	1
that	1
she	1
should	1
leave	1
it	1
to	1
her	1
daughters,	1
than	1
to	1
us?"	1
"Her	1
daughters	1
are	1
both	1
exceedingly	1
well	1
married,	1
and	1
therefore	1
I	1
cannot	1
perceive	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
her	1
remembering	1
them	1
farther.	1
Whereas,	1
in	1
my	1
opinion,	1
by	1
her	1
taking	1
so	1
much	1
notice	1
of	1
you,	1
and	1
treating	1
you	1
in	1
this	1
kind	1
of	1
way,	1
she	1
has	1
given	1
you	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
claim	1
on	1
her	1
future	1
consideration,	1
which	1
a	1
conscientious	1
woman	1
would	1
not	1
disregard.	1
Nothing	1
can	1
be	1
kinder	1
than	1
her	1
behaviour;	1
and	1
she	1
can	1
hardly	1
do	1
all	1
this,	1
without	1
being	1
aware	1
of	1
the	1
expectation	1
it	1
raises."	1
"But	1
she	1
raises	1
none	1
in	1
those	1
most	1
concerned.	1
Indeed,	1
brother,	1
your	1
anxiety	1
for	1
our	1
welfare	1
and	1
prosperity	1
carries	1
you	1
too	1
far."	1
"Why,	1
to	1
be	1
sure,"	1
said	1
he,	1
seeming	1
to	1
recollect	1
himself,	1
"people	1
have	1
little,	1
have	1
very	1
little	1
in	1
their	1
power.	1
But,	1
my	1
dear	1
Elinor,	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
Marianne?--	1
she	1
looks	1
very	1
unwell,	1
has	1
lost	1
her	1
colour,	1
and	1
is	1
grown	1
quite	1
thin.	1
Is	1
she	1
ill?"	1
"She	1
is	1
not	1
well,	1
she	1
has	1
had	1
a	1
nervous	1
complaint	1
on	1
her	1
for	1
several	1
weeks."	1
"I	1
am	1
sorry	1
for	1
that.	1
At	1
her	1
time	1
of	1
life,	1
any	1
thing	1
of	1
an	1
illness	1
destroys	1
the	1
bloom	1
for	1
ever!	1
Her's	1
has	1
been	1
a	1
very	1
short	1
one!	1
She	1
was	1
as	1
handsome	1
a	1
girl	1
last	1
September,	1
as	1
I	1
ever	1
saw;	1
and	1
as	1
likely	1
to	1
attract	1
the	1
man.	1
There	1
was	1
something	1
in	1
her	1
style	1
of	1
beauty,	1
to	1
please	1
them	1
particularly.	1
I	1
remember	1
Fanny	1
used	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
marry	1
sooner	1
and	1
better	1
than	1
you	1
did;	1
not	1
but	1
what	1
she	1
is	1
exceedingly	1
fond	1
of	1
YOU,	1
but	1
so	1
it	1
happened	1
to	1
strike	1
her.	1
She	1
will	1
be	1
mistaken,	1
however.	1
I	1
question	1
whether	1
Marianne	1
NOW,	1
will	1
marry	1
a	1
man	1
worth	1
more	1
than	1
five	1
or	1
six	1
hundred	1
a-year,	1
at	1
the	1
utmost,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
much	1
deceived	1
if	1
YOU	1
do	1
not	1
do	1
better.	1
Dorsetshire!	1
I	1
know	1
very	1
little	1
of	1
Dorsetshire;	1
but,	1
my	1
dear	1
Elinor,	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
exceedingly	1
glad	1
to	1
know	1
more	1
of	1
it;	1
and	1
I	1
think	1
I	1
can	1
answer	1
for	1
your	1
having	1
Fanny	1
and	1
myself	1
among	1
the	1
earliest	1
and	1
best	1
pleased	1
of	1
your	1
visitors."	1
Elinor	1
tried	1
very	1
seriously	1
to	1
convince	1
him	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
likelihood	1
of	1
her	1
marrying	1
Colonel	1
Brandon;	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
an	1
expectation	1
of	1
too	1
much	1
pleasure	1
to	1
himself	1
to	1
be	1
relinquished,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
really	1
resolved	1
on	1
seeking	1
an	1
intimacy	1
with	1
that	1
gentleman,	1
and	1
promoting	1
the	1
marriage	1
by	1
every	1
possible	1
attention.	1
He	1
had	1
just	1
compunction	1
enough	1
for	1
having	1
done	1
nothing	1
for	1
his	1
sisters	1
himself,	1
to	1
be	1
exceedingly	1
anxious	1
that	1
everybody	1
else	1
should	1
do	1
a	1
great	1
deal;	1
and	1
an	1
offer	1
from	1
Colonel	1
Brandon,	1
or	1
a	1
legacy	1
from	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings,	1
was	1
the	1
easiest	1
means	1
of	1
atoning	1
for	1
his	1
own	1
neglect.	1
They	1
were	1
lucky	1
enough	1
to	1
find	1
Lady	1
Middleton	1
at	1
home,	1
and	1
Sir	1
John	1
came	1
in	1
before	1
their	1
visit	1
ended.	1
Abundance	1
of	1
civilities	1
passed	1
on	1
all	1
sides.	1
Sir	1
John	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
like	1
anybody,	1
and	1
though	1
Mr.	1
Dashwood	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
know	1
much	1
about	1
horses,	1
he	1
soon	1
set	1
him	1
down	1
as	1
a	1
very	1
good-natured	1
fellow:	1
while	1
Lady	1
Middleton	1
saw	1
enough	1
of	1
fashion	1
in	1
his	1
appearance	1
to	1
think	1
his	1
acquaintance	1
worth	1
having;	1
and	1
Mr.	1
Dashwood	1
went	1
away	1
delighted	1
with	1
both.	1
"I	1
shall	1
have	1
a	1
charming	1
account	1
to	1
carry	1
to	1
Fanny,"	1
said	1
he,	1
as	1
he	1
walked	1
back	1
with	1
his	1
sister.	1
"Lady	1
Middleton	1
is	1
really	1
a	1
most	1
elegant	1
woman!	1
Such	1
a	1
woman	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
Fanny	1
will	1
be	1
glad	1
to	1
know.	1
And	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
too,	1
an	1
exceedingly	1
well-behaved	1
woman,	1
though	1
not	1
so	1
elegant	1
as	1
her	1
daughter.	1
Your	1
sister	1
need	1
not	1
have	1
any	1
scruple	1
even	1
of	1
visiting	1
HER,	1
which,	1
to	1
say	1
the	1
truth,	1
has	1
been	1
a	1
little	1
the	1
case,	1
and	1
very	1
naturally;	1
for	1
we	1
only	1
knew	1
that	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
was	1
the	1
widow	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
got	1
all	1
his	1
money	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
way;	1
and	1
Fanny	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Ferrars	1
were	1
both	1
strongly	1
prepossessed,	1
that	1
neither	1
she	1
nor	1
her	1
daughters	1
were	1
such	1
kind	1
of	1
women	1
as	1
Fanny	1
would	1
like	1
to	1
associate	1
with.	1
But	1
now	1
I	1
can	1
carry	1
her	1
a	1
most	1
satisfactory	1
account	1
of	1
both."	1
CHAPTER	1
34	1
Mrs.	1
John	1
Dashwood	1
had	1
so	1
much	1
confidence	1
in	1
her	1
husband's	1
judgment,	1
that	1
she	1
waited	1
the	1
very	1
next	1
day	1
both	1
on	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
and	1
her	1
daughter;	1
and	1
her	1
confidence	1
was	1
rewarded	1
by	1
finding	1
even	1
the	1
former,	1
even	1
the	1
woman	1
with	1
whom	1
her	1
sisters	1
were	1
staying,	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
unworthy	1
her	1
notice;	1
and	1
as	1
for	1
Lady	1
Middleton,	1
she	1
found	1
her	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
charming	1
women	1
in	1
the	1
world!	1
Lady	1
Middleton	1
was	1
equally	1
pleased	1
with	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
cold	1
hearted	1
selfishness	1
on	1
both	1
sides,	1
which	1
mutually	1
attracted	1
them;	1
and	1
they	1
sympathised	1
with	1
each	1
other	1
in	1
an	1
insipid	1
propriety	1
of	1
demeanor,	1
and	1
a	1
general	1
want	1
of	1
understanding.	1
The	1
same	1
manners,	1
however,	1
which	1
recommended	1
Mrs.	1
John	1
Dashwood	1
to	1
the	1
good	1
opinion	1
of	1
Lady	1
Middleton	1
did	1
not	1
suit	1
the	1
fancy	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings,	1
and	1
to	1
HER	1
she	1
appeared	1
nothing	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
little	1
proud-looking	1
woman	1
of	1
uncordial	1
address,	1
who	1
met	1
her	1
husband's	1
sisters	1
without	1
any	1
affection,	1
and	1
almost	1
without	1
having	1
anything	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
them;	1
for	1
of	1
the	1
quarter	1
of	1
an	1
hour	1
bestowed	1
on	1
Berkeley	1
Street,	1
she	1
sat	1
at	1
least	1
seven	1
minutes	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
in	1
silence.	1
Elinor	1
wanted	1
very	1
much	1
to	1
know,	1
though	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
chuse	1
to	1
ask,	1
whether	1
Edward	1
was	1
then	1
in	1
town;	1
but	1
nothing	1
would	1
have	1
induced	1
Fanny	1
voluntarily	1
to	1
mention	1
his	1
name	1
before	1
her,	1
till	1
able	1
to	1
tell	1
her	1
that	1
his	1
marriage	1
with	1
Miss	1
Morton	1
was	1
resolved	1
on,	1
or	1
till	1
her	1
husband's	1
expectations	1
on	1
Colonel	1
Brandon	1
were	1
answered;	1
because	1
she	1
believed	1
them	1
still	1
so	1
very	1
much	1
attached	1
to	1
each	1
other,	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
too	1
sedulously	1
divided	1
in	1
word	1
and	1
deed	1
on	1
every	1
occasion.	1
The	1
intelligence	1
however,	1
which	1
SHE	1
would	1
not	1
give,	1
soon	1
flowed	1
from	1
another	1
quarter.	1
Lucy	1
came	1
very	1
shortly	1
to	1
claim	1
Elinor's	1
compassion	1
on	1
being	1
unable	1
to	1
see	1
Edward,	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
arrived	1
in	1
town	1
with	1
Mr.	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood.	1
He	1
dared	1
not	1
come	1
to	1
Bartlett's	1
Buildings	1
for	1
fear	1
of	1
detection,	1
and	1
though	1
their	1
mutual	1
impatience	1
to	1
meet,	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
told,	1
they	1
could	1
do	1
nothing	1
at	1
present	1
but	1
write.	1
Edward	1
assured	1
them	1
himself	1
of	1
his	1
being	1
in	1
town,	1
within	1
a	1
very	1
short	1
time,	1
by	1
twice	1
calling	1
in	1
Berkeley	1
Street.	1
Twice	1
was	1
his	1
card	1
found	1
on	1
the	1
table,	1
when	1
they	1
returned	1
from	1
their	1
morning's	1
engagements.	1
Elinor	1
was	1
pleased	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
called;	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
pleased	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
missed	1
him.	1
The	1
Dashwoods	1
were	1
so	1
prodigiously	1
delighted	1
with	1
the	1
Middletons,	1
that,	1
though	1
not	1
much	1
in	1
the	1
habit	1
of	1
giving	1
anything,	1
they	1
determined	1
to	1
give	1
them--	1
a	1
dinner;	1
and	1
soon	1
after	1
their	1
acquaintance	1
began,	1
invited	1
them	1
to	1
dine	1
in	1
Harley	1
Street,	1
where	1
they	1
had	1
taken	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
house	1
for	1
three	1
months.	1
Their	1
sisters	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
were	1
invited	1
likewise,	1
and	1
John	1
Dashwood	1
was	1
careful	1
to	1
secure	1
Colonel	1
Brandon,	1
who,	1
always	1
glad	1
to	1
be	1
where	1
the	1
Miss	1
Dashwoods	1
were,	1
received	1
his	1
eager	1
civilities	1
with	1
some	1
surprise,	1
but	1
much	1
more	1
pleasure.	1
They	1
were	1
to	1
meet	1
Mrs.	1
Ferrars;	1
but	1
Elinor	1
could	1
not	1
learn	1
whether	1
her	1
sons	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
the	1
party.	1
The	1
expectation	1
of	1
seeing	1
HER,	1
however,	1
was	1
enough	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
interested	1
in	1
the	1
engagement;	1
for	1
though	1
she	1
could	1
now	1
meet	1
Edward's	1
mother	1
without	1
that	1
strong	1
anxiety	1
which	1
had	1
once	1
promised	1
to	1
attend	1
such	1
an	1
introduction,	1
though	1
she	1
could	1
now	1
see	1
her	1
with	1
perfect	1
indifference	1
as	1
to	1
her	1
opinion	1
of	1
herself,	1
her	1
desire	1
of	1
being	1
in	1
company	1
with	1
Mrs.	1
Ferrars,	1
her	1
curiosity	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
like,	1
was	1
as	1
lively	1
as	1
ever.	1
The	1
interest	1
with	1
which	1
she	1
thus	1
anticipated	1
the	1
party,	1
was	1
soon	1
afterwards	1
increased,	1
more	1
powerfully	1
than	1
pleasantly,	1
by	1
her	1
hearing	1
that	1
the	1
Miss	1
Steeles	1
were	1
also	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
it.	1
So	1
well	1
had	1
they	1
recommended	1
themselves	1
to	1
Lady	1
Middleton,	1
so	1
agreeable	1
had	1
their	1
assiduities	1
made	1
them	1
to	1
her,	1
that	1
though	1
Lucy	1
was	1
certainly	1
not	1
so	1
elegant,	1
and	1
her	1
sister	1
not	1
even	1
genteel,	1
she	1
was	1
as	1
ready	1
as	1
Sir	1
John	1
to	1
ask	1
them	1
to	1
spend	1
a	1
week	1
or	1
two	1
in	1
Conduit	1
Street;	1
and	1
it	1
happened	1
to	1
be	1
particularly	1
convenient	1
to	1
the	1
Miss	1
Steeles,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
Dashwoods'	1
invitation	1
was	1
known,	1
that	1
their	1
visit	1
should	1
begin	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
before	1
the	1
party	1
took	1
place.	1
Their	1
claims	1
to	1
the	1
notice	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
John	1
Dashwood,	1
as	1
the	1
nieces	1
of	1
the	1
gentleman	1
who	1
for	1
many	1
years	1
had	1
had	1
the	1
care	1
of	1
her	1
brother,	1
might	1
not	1
have	1
done	1
much,	1
however,	1
towards	1
procuring	1
them	1
seats	1
at	1
her	1
table;	1
but	1
as	1
Lady	1
Middleton's	1
guests	1
they	1
must	1
be	1
welcome;	1
and	1
Lucy,	1
who	1
had	1
long	1
wanted	1
to	1
be	1
personally	1
known	1
to	1
the	1
family,	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
nearer	1
view	1
of	1
their	1
characters	1
and	1
her	1
own	1
difficulties,	1
and	1
to	1
have	1
an	1
opportunity	1
of	1
endeavouring	1
to	1
please	1
them,	1
had	1
seldom	1
been	1
happier	1
in	1
her	1
life,	1
than	1
she	1
was	1
on	1
receiving	1
Mrs.	1
John	1
Dashwood's	1
card.	1
On	1
Elinor	1
its	1
effect	1
was	1
very	1
different.	1
She	1
began	1
immediately	1
to	1
determine,	1
that	1
Edward	1
who	1
lived	1
with	1
his	1
mother,	1
must	1
be	1
asked	1
as	1
his	1
mother	1
was,	1
to	1
a	1
party	1
given	1
by	1
his	1
sister;	1
and	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time,	1
after	1
all	1
that	1
passed,	1
in	1
the	1
company	1
of	1
Lucy!--she	1
hardly	1
knew	1
how	1
she	1
could	1
bear	1
it!	1
These	1
apprehensions,	1
perhaps,	1
were	1
not	1
founded	1
entirely	1
on	1
reason,	1
and	1
certainly	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
on	1
truth.	1
They	1
were	1
relieved	1
however,	1
not	1
by	1
her	1
own	1
recollection,	1
but	1
by	1
the	1
good	1
will	1
of	1
Lucy,	1
who	1
believed	1
herself	1
to	1
be	1
inflicting	1
a	1
severe	1
disappointment	1
when	1
she	1
told	1
her	1
that	1
Edward	1
certainly	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
in	1
Harley	1
Street	1
on	1
Tuesday,	1
and	1
even	1
hoped	1
to	1
be	1
carrying	1
the	1
pain	1
still	1
farther	1
by	1
persuading	1
her	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
kept	1
away	1
by	1
the	1
extreme	1
affection	1
for	1
herself,	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
conceal	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
together.	1
The	1
important	1
Tuesday	1
came	1
that	1
was	1
to	1
introduce	1
the	1
two	1
young	1
ladies	1
to	1
this	1
formidable	1
mother-in-law.	1
"Pity	1
me,	1
dear	1
Miss	1
Dashwood!"	1
said	1
Lucy,	1
as	1
they	1
walked	1
up	1
the	1
stairs	1
together--for	1
the	1
Middletons	1
arrived	1
so	1
directly	1
after	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings,	1
that	1
they	1
all	1
followed	1
the	1
servant	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time--"There	1
is	1
nobody	1
here	1
but	1
you,	1
that	1
can	1
feel	1
for	1
me.--I	1
declare	1
I	1
can	1
hardly	1
stand.	1
Good	1
gracious!--In	1
a	1
moment	1
I	1
shall	1
see	1
the	1
person	1
that	1
all	1
my	1
happiness	1
depends	1
on--that	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
my	1
mother!"--	1
Elinor	1
could	1
have	1
given	1
her	1
immediate	1
relief	1
by	1
suggesting	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
its	1
being	1
Miss	1
Morton's	1
mother,	1
rather	1
than	1
her	1
own,	1
whom	1
they	1
were	1
about	1
to	1
behold;	1
but	1
instead	1
of	1
doing	1
that,	1
she	1
assured	1
her,	1
and	1
with	1
great	1
sincerity,	1
that	1
she	1
did	1
pity	1
her--to	1
the	1
utter	1
amazement	1
of	1
Lucy,	1
who,	1
though	1
really	1
uncomfortable	1
herself,	1
hoped	1
at	1
least	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
object	1
of	1
irrepressible	1
envy	1
to	1
Elinor.	1
Mrs.	1
Ferrars	1
was	1
a	1
little,	1
thin	1
woman,	1
upright,	1
even	1
to	1
formality,	1
in	1
her	1
figure,	1
and	1
serious,	1
even	1
to	1
sourness,	1
in	1
her	1
aspect.	1
Her	1
complexion	1
was	1
sallow;	1
and	1
her	1
features	1
small,	1
without	1
beauty,	1
and	1
naturally	1
without	1
expression;	1
but	1
a	1
lucky	1
contraction	1
of	1
the	1
brow	1
had	1
rescued	1
her	1
countenance	1
from	1
the	1
disgrace	1
of	1
insipidity,	1
by	1
giving	1
it	1
the	1
strong	1
characters	1
of	1
pride	1
and	1
ill	1
nature.	1
She	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
woman	1
of	1
many	1
words;	1
for,	1
unlike	1
people	1
in	1
general,	1
she	1
proportioned	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
her	1
ideas;	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
few	1
syllables	1
that	1
did	1
escape	1
her,	1
not	1
one	1
fell	1
to	1
the	1
share	1
of	1
Miss	1
Dashwood,	1
whom	1
she	1
eyed	1
with	1
the	1
spirited	1
determination	1
of	1
disliking	1
her	1
at	1
all	1
events.	1
Elinor	1
could	1
not	1
NOW	1
be	1
made	1
unhappy	1
by	1
this	1
behaviour.--	1
A	1
few	1
months	1
ago	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
hurt	1
her	1
exceedingly;	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
Mrs.	1
Ferrars'	1
power	1
to	1
distress	1
her	1
by	1
it	1
now;--	1
and	1
the	1
difference	1
of	1
her	1
manners	1
to	1
the	1
Miss	1
Steeles,	1
a	1
difference	1
which	1
seemed	1
purposely	1
made	1
to	1
humble	1
her	1
more,	1
only	1
amused	1
her.	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
smile	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
graciousness	1
of	1
both	1
mother	1
and	1
daughter	1
towards	1
the	1
very	1
person--	1
for	1
Lucy	1
was	1
particularly	1
distinguished--whom	1
of	1
all	1
others,	1
had	1
they	1
known	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
she	1
did,	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
most	1
anxious	1
to	1
mortify;	1
while	1
she	1
herself,	1
who	1
had	1
comparatively	1
no	1
power	1
to	1
wound	1
them,	1
sat	1
pointedly	1
slighted	1
by	1
both.	1
But	1
while	1
she	1
smiled	1
at	1
a	1
graciousness	1
so	1
misapplied,	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
reflect	1
on	1
the	1
mean-spirited	1
folly	1
from	1
which	1
it	1
sprung,	1
nor	1
observe	1
the	1
studied	1
attentions	1
with	1
which	1
the	1
Miss	1
Steeles	1
courted	1
its	1
continuance,	1
without	1
thoroughly	1
despising	1
them	1
all	1
four.	1
Lucy	1
was	1
all	1
exultation	1
on	1
being	1
so	1
honorably	1
distinguished;	1
and	1
Miss	1
Steele	1
wanted	1
only	1
to	1
be	1
teazed	1
about	1
Dr.	1
Davies	1
to	1
be	1
perfectly	1
happy.	1
The	1
dinner	1
was	1
a	1
grand	1
one,	1
the	1
servants	1
were	1
numerous,	1
and	1
every	1
thing	1
bespoke	1
the	1
Mistress's	1
inclination	1
for	1
show,	1
and	1
the	1
Master's	1
ability	1
to	1
support	1
it.	1
In	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
improvements	1
and	1
additions	1
which	1
were	1
making	1
to	1
the	1
Norland	1
estate,	1
and	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
its	1
owner	1
having	1
once	1
been	1
within	1
some	1
thousand	1
pounds	1
of	1
being	1
obliged	1
to	1
sell	1
out	1
at	1
a	1
loss,	1
nothing	1
gave	1
any	1
symptom	1
of	1
that	1
indigence	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
tried	1
to	1
infer	1
from	1
it;--	1
no	1
poverty	1
of	1
any	1
kind,	1
except	1
of	1
conversation,	1
appeared--	1
but	1
there,	1
the	1
deficiency	1
was	1
considerable.	1
John	1
Dashwood	1
had	1
not	1
much	1
to	1
say	1
for	1
himself	1
that	1
was	1
worth	1
hearing,	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
had	1
still	1
less.	1
But	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
peculiar	1
disgrace	1
in	1
this;	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
very	1
much	1
the	1
case	1
with	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
their	1
visitors,	1
who	1
almost	1
all	1
laboured	1
under	1
one	1
or	1
other	1
of	1
these	1
disqualifications	1
for	1
being	1
agreeable--Want	1
of	1
sense,	1
either	1
natural	1
or	1
improved--want	1
of	1
elegance--want	1
of	1
spirits--or	1
want	1
of	1
temper.	1
When	1
the	1
ladies	1
withdrew	1
to	1
the	1
drawing-room	1
after	1
dinner,	1
this	1
poverty	1
was	1
particularly	1
evident,	1
for	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
HAD	1
supplied	1
the	1
discourse	1
with	1
some	1
variety--the	1
variety	1
of	1
politics,	1
inclosing	1
land,	1
and	1
breaking	1
horses--but	1
then	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
over;	1
and	1
one	1
subject	1
only	1
engaged	1
the	1
ladies	1
till	1
coffee	1
came	1
in,	1
which	1
was	1
the	1
comparative	1
heights	1
of	1
Harry	1
Dashwood,	1
and	1
Lady	1
Middleton's	1
second	1
son	1
William,	1
who	1
were	1
nearly	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
age.	1
Had	1
both	1
the	1
children	1
been	1
there,	1
the	1
affair	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
determined	1
too	1
easily	1
by	1
measuring	1
them	1
at	1
once;	1
but	1
as	1
Harry	1
only	1
was	1
present,	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
conjectural	1
assertion	1
on	1
both	1
sides;	1
and	1
every	1
body	1
had	1
a	1
right	1
to	1
be	1
equally	1
positive	1
in	1
their	1
opinion,	1
and	1
to	1
repeat	1
it	1
over	1
and	1
over	1
again	1
as	1
often	1
as	1
they	1
liked.	1
The	1
parties	1
stood	1
thus:	1
The	1
two	1
mothers,	1
though	1
each	1
really	1
convinced	1
that	1
her	1
own	1
son	1
was	1
the	1
tallest,	1
politely	1
decided	1
in	1
favour	1
of	1
the	1
other.	1
The	1
two	1
grandmothers,	1
with	1
not	1
less	1
partiality,	1
but	1
more	1
sincerity,	1
were	1
equally	1
earnest	1
in	1
support	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
descendant.	1
Lucy,	1
who	1
was	1
hardly	1
less	1
anxious	1
to	1
please	1
one	1
parent	1
than	1
the	1
other,	1
thought	1
the	1
boys	1
were	1
both	1
remarkably	1
tall	1
for	1
their	1
age,	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
conceive	1
that	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
the	1
smallest	1
difference	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
between	1
them;	1
and	1
Miss	1
Steele,	1
with	1
yet	1
greater	1
address	1
gave	1
it,	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
she	1
could,	1
in	1
favour	1
of	1
each.	1
Elinor,	1
having	1
once	1
delivered	1
her	1
opinion	1
on	1
William's	1
side,	1
by	1
which	1
she	1
offended	1
Mrs.	1
Ferrars	1
and	1
Fanny	1
still	1
more,	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
enforcing	1
it	1
by	1
any	1
farther	1
assertion;	1
and	1
Marianne,	1
when	1
called	1
on	1
for	1
her's,	1
offended	1
them	1
all,	1
by	1
declaring	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
opinion	1
to	1
give,	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
never	1
thought	1
about	1
it.	1
Before	1
her	1
removing	1
from	1
Norland,	1
Elinor	1
had	1
painted	1
a	1
very	1
pretty	1
pair	1
of	1
screens	1
for	1
her	1
sister-in-law,	1
which	1
being	1
now	1
just	1
mounted	1
and	1
brought	1
home,	1
ornamented	1
her	1
present	1
drawing	1
room;	1
and	1
these	1
screens,	1
catching	1
the	1
eye	1
of	1
John	1
Dashwood	1
on	1
his	1
following	1
the	1
other	1
gentlemen	1
into	1
the	1
room,	1
were	1
officiously	1
handed	1
by	1
him	1
to	1
Colonel	1
Brandon	1
for	1
his	1
admiration.	1
"These	1
are	1
done	1
by	1
my	1
eldest	1
sister,"	1
said	1
he;	1
"and	1
you,	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
taste,	1
will,	1
I	1
dare	1
say,	1
be	1
pleased	1
with	1
them.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
whether	1
you	1
have	1
ever	1
happened	1
to	1
see	1
any	1
of	1
her	1
performances	1
before,	1
but	1
she	1
is	1
in	1
general	1
reckoned	1
to	1
draw	1
extremely	1
well."	1
The	1
Colonel,	1
though	1
disclaiming	1
all	1
pretensions	1
to	1
connoisseurship,	1
warmly	1
admired	1
the	1
screens,	1
as	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
done	1
any	1
thing	1
painted	1
by	1
Miss	1
Dashwood;	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
curiosity	1
of	1
the	1
others	1
being	1
of	1
course	1
excited,	1
they	1
were	1
handed	1
round	1
for	1
general	1
inspection.	1
Mrs.	1
Ferrars,	1
not	1
aware	1
of	1
their	1
being	1
Elinor's	1
work,	1
particularly	1
requested	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
them;	1
and	1
after	1
they	1
had	1
received	1
gratifying	1
testimony	1
of	1
Lady	1
Middletons's	1
approbation,	1
Fanny	1
presented	1
them	1
to	1
her	1
mother,	1
considerately	1
informing	1
her,	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
done	1
by	1
Miss	1
Dashwood.	1
"Hum"--said	1
Mrs.	1
Ferrars--"very	1
pretty,"--and	1
without	1
regarding	1
them	1
at	1
all,	1
returned	1
them	1
to	1
her	1
daughter.	1
Perhaps	1
Fanny	1
thought	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
that	1
her	1
mother	1
had	1
been	1
quite	1
rude	1
enough,--for,	1
colouring	1
a	1
little,	1
she	1
immediately	1
said,	1
"They	1
are	1
very	1
pretty,	1
ma'am--an't	1
they?"	1
But	1
then	1
again,	1
the	1
dread	1
of	1
having	1
been	1
too	1
civil,	1
too	1
encouraging	1
herself,	1
probably	1
came	1
over	1
her,	1
for	1
she	1
presently	1
added,	1
"Do	1
you	1
not	1
think	1
they	1
are	1
something	1
in	1
Miss	1
Morton's	1
style	1
of	1
painting,	1
Ma'am?--She	1
DOES	1
paint	1
most	1
delightfully!--How	1
beautifully	1
her	1
last	1
landscape	1
is	1
done!"	1
"Beautifully	1
indeed!	1
But	1
SHE	1
does	1
every	1
thing	1
well."	1
Marianne	1
could	1
not	1
bear	1
this.--She	1
was	1
already	1
greatly	1
displeased	1
with	1
Mrs.	1
Ferrars;	1
and	1
such	1
ill-timed	1
praise	1
of	1
another,	1
at	1
Elinor's	1
expense,	1
though	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
any	1
notion	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
principally	1
meant	1
by	1
it,	1
provoked	1
her	1
immediately	1
to	1
say	1
with	1
warmth,	1
"This	1
is	1
admiration	1
of	1
a	1
very	1
particular	1
kind!--	1
what	1
is	1
Miss	1
Morton	1
to	1
us?--who	1
knows,	1
or	1
who	1
cares,	1
for	1
her?--it	1
is	1
Elinor	1
of	1
whom	1
WE	1
think	1
and	1
speak."	1
And	1
so	1
saying,	1
she	1
took	1
the	1
screens	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
sister-in-law's	1
hands,	1
to	1
admire	1
them	1
herself	1
as	1
they	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
admired.	1
Mrs.	1
Ferrars	1
looked	1
exceedingly	1
angry,	1
and	1
drawing	1
herself	1
up	1
more	1
stiffly	1
than	1
ever,	1
pronounced	1
in	1
retort	1
this	1
bitter	1
philippic,	1
"Miss	1
Morton	1
is	1
Lord	1
Morton's	1
daughter."	1
Fanny	1
looked	1
very	1
angry	1
too,	1
and	1
her	1
husband	1
was	1
all	1
in	1
a	1
fright	1
at	1
his	1
sister's	1
audacity.	1
Elinor	1
was	1
much	1
more	1
hurt	1
by	1
Marianne's	1
warmth	1
than	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
by	1
what	1
produced	1
it;	1
but	1
Colonel	1
Brandon's	1
eyes,	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
fixed	1
on	1
Marianne,	1
declared	1
that	1
he	1
noticed	1
only	1
what	1
was	1
amiable	1
in	1
it,	1
the	1
affectionate	1
heart	1
which	1
could	1
not	1
bear	1
to	1
see	1
a	1
sister	1
slighted	1
in	1
the	1
smallest	1
point.	1
Marianne's	1
feelings	1
did	1
not	1
stop	1
here.	1
The	1
cold	1
insolence	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
Ferrars's	1
general	1
behaviour	1
to	1
her	1
sister,	1
seemed,	1
to	1
her,	1
to	1
foretell	1
such	1
difficulties	1
and	1
distresses	1
to	1
Elinor,	1
as	1
her	1
own	1
wounded	1
heart	1
taught	1
her	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
with	1
horror;	1
and	1
urged	1
by	1
a	1
strong	1
impulse	1
of	1
affectionate	1
sensibility,	1
she	1
moved	1
after	1
a	1
moment,	1
to	1
her	1
sister's	1
chair,	1
and	1
putting	1
one	1
arm	1
round	1
her	1
neck,	1
and	1
one	1
cheek	1
close	1
to	1
hers,	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
low,	1
but	1
eager,	1
voice,	1
"Dear,	1
dear	1
Elinor,	1
don't	1
mind	1
them.	1
Don't	1
let	1
them	1
make	1
YOU	1
unhappy."	1
She	1
could	1
say	1
no	1
more;	1
her	1
spirits	1
were	1
quite	1
overcome,	1
and	1
hiding	1
her	1
face	1
on	1
Elinor's	1
shoulder,	1
she	1
burst	1
into	1
tears.	1
Every	1
body's	1
attention	1
was	1
called,	1
and	1
almost	1
every	1
body	1
was	1
concerned.--Colonel	1
Brandon	1
rose	1
up	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
them	1
without	1
knowing	1
what	1
he	1
did.--Mrs.	1
Jennings,	1
with	1
a	1
very	1
intelligent	1
"Ah!	1
poor	1
dear,"	1
immediately	1
gave	1
her	1
her	1
salts;	1
and	1
Sir	1
John	1
felt	1
so	1
desperately	1
enraged	1
against	1
the	1
author	1
of	1
this	1
nervous	1
distress,	1
that	1
he	1
instantly	1
changed	1
his	1
seat	1
to	1
one	1
close	1
by	1
Lucy	1
Steele,	1
and	1
gave	1
her,	1
in	1
a	1
whisper,	1
a	1
brief	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
shocking	1
affair.	1
In	1
a	1
few	1
minutes,	1
however,	1
Marianne	1
was	1
recovered	1
enough	1
to	1
put	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
the	1
bustle,	1
and	1
sit	1
down	1
among	1
the	1
rest;	1
though	1
her	1
spirits	1
retained	1
the	1
impression	1
of	1
what	1
had	1
passed,	1
the	1
whole	1
evening.	1
"Poor	1
Marianne!"	1
said	1
her	1
brother	1
to	1
Colonel	1
Brandon,	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
secure	1
his	1
attention,--	1
"She	1
has	1
not	1
such	1
good	1
health	1
as	1
her	1
sister,--she	1
is	1
very	1
nervous,--she	1
has	1
not	1
Elinor's	1
constitution;--and	1
one	1
must	1
allow	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
something	1
very	1
trying	1
to	1
a	1
young	1
woman	1
who	1
HAS	1
BEEN	1
a	1
beauty	1
in	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
her	1
personal	1
attractions.	1
You	1
would	1
not	1
think	1
it	1
perhaps,	1
but	1
Marianne	1
WAS	1
remarkably	1
handsome	1
a	1
few	1
months	1
ago;	1
quite	1
as	1
handsome	1
as	1
Elinor.--	1
Now	1
you	1
see	1
it	1
is	1
all	1
gone."	1
CHAPTER	1
35	1
Elinor's	1
curiosity	1
to	1
see	1
Mrs.	1
Ferrars	1
was	1
satisfied.--	1
She	1
had	1
found	1
in	1
her	1
every	1
thing	1
that	1
could	1
tend	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
farther	1
connection	1
between	1
the	1
families	1
undesirable.--	1
She	1
had	1
seen	1
enough	1
of	1
her	1
pride,	1
her	1
meanness,	1
and	1
her	1
determined	1
prejudice	1
against	1
herself,	1
to	1
comprehend	1
all	1
the	1
difficulties	1
that	1
must	1
have	1
perplexed	1
the	1
engagement,	1
and	1
retarded	1
the	1
marriage,	1
of	1
Edward	1
and	1
herself,	1
had	1
he	1
been	1
otherwise	1
free;--and	1
she	1
had	1
seen	1
almost	1
enough	1
to	1
be	1
thankful	1
for	1
her	1
OWN	1
sake,	1
that	1
one	1
greater	1
obstacle	1
preserved	1
her	1
from	1
suffering	1
under	1
any	1
other	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
Ferrars's	1
creation,	1
preserved	1
her	1
from	1
all	1
dependence	1
upon	1
her	1
caprice,	1
or	1
any	1
solicitude	1
for	1
her	1
good	1
opinion.	1
Or	1
at	1
least,	1
if	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
bring	1
herself	1
quite	1
to	1
rejoice	1
in	1
Edward's	1
being	1
fettered	1
to	1
Lucy,	1
she	1
determined,	1
that	1
had	1
Lucy	1
been	1
more	1
amiable,	1
she	1
OUGHT	1
to	1
have	1
rejoiced.	1
She	1
wondered	1
that	1
Lucy's	1
spirits	1
could	1
be	1
so	1
very	1
much	1
elevated	1
by	1
the	1
civility	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
Ferrars;--that	1
her	1
interest	1
and	1
her	1
vanity	1
should	1
so	1
very	1
much	1
blind	1
her	1
as	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
attention	1
which	1
seemed	1
only	1
paid	1
her	1
because	1
she	1
was	1
NOT	1
ELINOR,	1
appear	1
a	1
compliment	1
to	1
herself--or	1
to	1
allow	1
her	1
to	1
derive	1
encouragement	1
from	1
a	1
preference	1
only	1
given	1
her,	1
because	1
her	1
real	1
situation	1
was	1
unknown.	1
But	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
so,	1
had	1
not	1
only	1
been	1
declared	1
by	1
Lucy's	1
eyes	1
at	1
the	1
time,	1
but	1
was	1
declared	1
over	1
again	1
the	1
next	1
morning	1
more	1
openly,	1
for	1
at	1
her	1
particular	1
desire,	1
Lady	1
Middleton	1
set	1
her	1
down	1
in	1
Berkeley	1
Street	1
on	1
the	1
chance	1
of	1
seeing	1
Elinor	1
alone,	1
to	1
tell	1
her	1
how	1
happy	1
she	1
was.	1
The	1
chance	1
proved	1
a	1
lucky	1
one,	1
for	1
a	1
message	1
from	1
Mrs.	1
Palmer	1
soon	1
after	1
she	1
arrived,	1
carried	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
away.	1
"My	1
dear	1
friend,"	1
cried	1
Lucy,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
by	1
themselves,	1
"I	1
come	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
you	1
of	1
my	1
happiness.	1
Could	1
anything	1
be	1
so	1
flattering	1
as	1
Mrs.	1
Ferrars's	1
way	1
of	1
treating	1
me	1
yesterday?	1
So	1
exceeding	1
affable	1
as	1
she	1
was!--You	1
know	1
how	1
I	1
dreaded	1
the	1
thoughts	1
of	1
seeing	1
her;--	1
but	1
the	1
very	1
moment	1
I	1
was	1
introduced,	1
there	1
was	1
such	1
an	1
affability	1
in	1
her	1
behaviour	1
as	1
really	1
should	1
seem	1
to	1
say,	1
she	1
had	1
quite	1
took	1
a	1
fancy	1
to	1
me.	1
Now	1
was	1
not	1
it	1
so?--	1
You	1
saw	1
it	1
all;	1
and	1
was	1
not	1
you	1
quite	1
struck	1
with	1
it?"	1
"She	1
was	1
certainly	1
very	1
civil	1
to	1
you."	1
"Civil!--Did	1
you	1
see	1
nothing	1
but	1
only	1
civility?--	1
I	1
saw	1
a	1
vast	1
deal	1
more.	1
Such	1
kindness	1
as	1
fell	1
to	1
the	1
share	1
of	1
nobody	1
but	1
me!--No	1
pride,	1
no	1
hauteur,	1
and	1
your	1
sister	1
just	1
the	1
same--all	1
sweetness	1
and	1
affability!"	1
Elinor	1
wished	1
to	1
talk	1
of	1
something	1
else,	1
but	1
Lucy	1
still	1
pressed	1
her	1
to	1
own	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
reason	1
for	1
her	1
happiness;	1
and	1
Elinor	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
go	1
on.--	1
"Undoubtedly,	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
known	1
your	1
engagement,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"nothing	1
could	1
be	1
more	1
flattering	1
than	1
their	1
treatment	1
of	1
you;--but	1
as	1
that	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
case"--	1
"I	1
guessed	1
you	1
would	1
say	1
so"--replied	1
Lucy	1
quickly--"but	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
reason	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
why	1
Mrs.	1
Ferrars	1
should	1
seem	1
to	1
like	1
me,	1
if	1
she	1
did	1
not,	1
and	1
her	1
liking	1
me	1
is	1
every	1
thing.	1
You	1
shan't	1
talk	1
me	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
satisfaction.	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
it	1
will	1
all	1
end	1
well,	1
and	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
no	1
difficulties	1
at	1
all,	1
to	1
what	1
I	1
used	1
to	1
think.	1
Mrs.	1
Ferrars	1
is	1
a	1
charming	1
woman,	1
and	1
so	1
is	1
your	1
sister.	1
They	1
are	1
both	1
delightful	1
women,	1
indeed!--I	1
wonder	1
I	1
should	1
never	1
hear	1
you	1
say	1
how	1
agreeable	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood	1
was!"	1
To	1
this	1
Elinor	1
had	1
no	1
answer	1
to	1
make,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
attempt	1
any.	1
"Are	1
you	1
ill,	1
Miss	1
Dashwood?--you	1
seem	1
low--you	1
don't	1
speak;--sure	1
you	1
an't	1
well."	1
"I	1
never	1
was	1
in	1
better	1
health."	1
"I	1
am	1
glad	1
of	1
it	1
with	1
all	1
my	1
heart;	1
but	1
really	1
you	1
did	1
not	1
look	1
it.	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
sorry	1
to	1
have	1
YOU	1
ill;	1
you,	1
that	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
greatest	1
comfort	1
to	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
world!--Heaven	1
knows	1
what	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
done	1
without	1
your	1
friendship."--	1
Elinor	1
tried	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
civil	1
answer,	1
though	1
doubting	1
her	1
own	1
success.	1
But	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
satisfy	1
Lucy,	1
for	1
she	1
directly	1
replied,	1
"Indeed	1
I	1
am	1
perfectly	1
convinced	1
of	1
your	1
regard	1
for	1
me,	1
and	1
next	1
to	1
Edward's	1
love,	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
greatest	1
comfort	1
I	1
have.--Poor	1
Edward!--But	1
now	1
there	1
is	1
one	1
good	1
thing,	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
meet,	1
and	1
meet	1
pretty	1
often,	1
for	1
Lady	1
Middleton's	1
delighted	1
with	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood,	1
so	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
in	1
Harley	1
Street,	1
I	1
dare	1
say,	1
and	1
Edward	1
spends	1
half	1
his	1
time	1
with	1
his	1
sister--besides,	1
Lady	1
Middleton	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Ferrars	1
will	1
visit	1
now;--	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Ferrars	1
and	1
your	1
sister	1
were	1
both	1
so	1
good	1
to	1
say	1
more	1
than	1
once,	1
they	1
should	1
always	1
be	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
me.--	1
They	1
are	1
such	1
charming	1
women!--I	1
am	1
sure	1
if	1
ever	1
you	1
tell	1
your	1
sister	1
what	1
I	1
think	1
of	1
her,	1
you	1
cannot	1
speak	1
too	1
high."	1
But	1
Elinor	1
would	1
not	1
give	1
her	1
any	1
encouragement	1
to	1
hope	1
that	1
she	1
SHOULD	1
tell	1
her	1
sister.	1
Lucy	1
continued.	1
"I	1
am	1
sure	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
seen	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
moment,	1
if	1
Mrs.	1
Ferrars	1
had	1
took	1
a	1
dislike	1
to	1
me.	1
If	1
she	1
had	1
only	1
made	1
me	1
a	1
formal	1
courtesy,	1
for	1
instance,	1
without	1
saying	1
a	1
word,	1
and	1
never	1
after	1
had	1
took	1
any	1
notice	1
of	1
me,	1
and	1
never	1
looked	1
at	1
me	1
in	1
a	1
pleasant	1
way--you	1
know	1
what	1
I	1
mean--if	1
I	1
had	1
been	1
treated	1
in	1
that	1
forbidding	1
sort	1
of	1
way,	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
gave	1
it	1
all	1
up	1
in	1
despair.	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
stood	1
it.	1
For	1
where	1
she	1
DOES	1
dislike,	1
I	1
know	1
it	1
is	1
most	1
violent."	1
Elinor	1
was	1
prevented	1
from	1
making	1
any	1
reply	1
to	1
this	1
civil	1
triumph,	1
by	1
the	1
door's	1
being	1
thrown	1
open,	1
the	1
servant's	1
announcing	1
Mr.	1
Ferrars,	1
and	1
Edward's	1
immediately	1
walking	1
in.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
awkward	1
moment;	1
and	1
the	1
countenance	1
of	1
each	1
shewed	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
so.	1
They	1
all	1
looked	1
exceedingly	1
foolish;	1
and	1
Edward	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
as	1
great	1
an	1
inclination	1
to	1
walk	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
again,	1
as	1
to	1
advance	1
farther	1
into	1
it.	1
The	1
very	1
circumstance,	1
in	1
its	1
unpleasantest	1
form,	1
which	1
they	1
would	1
each	1
have	1
been	1
most	1
anxious	1
to	1
avoid,	1
had	1
fallen	1
on	1
them.--They	1
were	1
not	1
only	1
all	1
three	1
together,	1
but	1
were	1
together	1
without	1
the	1
relief	1
of	1
any	1
other	1
person.	1
The	1
ladies	1
recovered	1
themselves	1
first.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
Lucy's	1
business	1
to	1
put	1
herself	1
forward,	1
and	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
secrecy	1
must	1
still	1
be	1
kept	1
up.	1
She	1
could	1
therefore	1
only	1
LOOK	1
her	1
tenderness,	1
and	1
after	1
slightly	1
addressing	1
him,	1
said	1
no	1
more.	1
But	1
Elinor	1
had	1
more	1
to	1
do;	1
and	1
so	1
anxious	1
was	1
she,	1
for	1
his	1
sake	1
and	1
her	1
own,	1
to	1
do	1
it	1
well,	1
that	1
she	1
forced	1
herself,	1
after	1
a	1
moment's	1
recollection,	1
to	1
welcome	1
him,	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
and	1
manner	1
that	1
were	1
almost	1
easy,	1
and	1
almost	1
open;	1
and	1
another	1
struggle,	1
another	1
effort	1
still	1
improved	1
them.	1
She	1
would	1
not	1
allow	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
Lucy,	1
nor	1
the	1
consciousness	1
of	1
some	1
injustice	1
towards	1
herself,	1
to	1
deter	1
her	1
from	1
saying	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
happy	1
to	1
see	1
him,	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
very	1
much	1
regretted	1
being	1
from	1
home,	1
when	1
he	1
called	1
before	1
in	1
Berkeley	1
Street.	1
She	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
frightened	1
from	1
paying	1
him	1
those	1
attentions	1
which,	1
as	1
a	1
friend	1
and	1
almost	1
a	1
relation,	1
were	1
his	1
due,	1
by	1
the	1
observant	1
eyes	1
of	1
Lucy,	1
though	1
she	1
soon	1
perceived	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
narrowly	1
watching	1
her.	1
Her	1
manners	1
gave	1
some	1
re-assurance	1
to	1
Edward,	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
courage	1
enough	1
to	1
sit	1
down;	1
but	1
his	1
embarrassment	1
still	1
exceeded	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
ladies	1
in	1
a	1
proportion,	1
which	1
the	1
case	1
rendered	1
reasonable,	1
though	1
his	1
sex	1
might	1
make	1
it	1
rare;	1
for	1
his	1
heart	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
indifference	1
of	1
Lucy's,	1
nor	1
could	1
his	1
conscience	1
have	1
quite	1
the	1
ease	1
of	1
Elinor's.	1
Lucy,	1
with	1
a	1
demure	1
and	1
settled	1
air,	1
seemed	1
determined	1
to	1
make	1
no	1
contribution	1
to	1
the	1
comfort	1
of	1
the	1
others,	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
say	1
a	1
word;	1
and	1
almost	1
every	1
thing	1
that	1
WAS	1
said,	1
proceeded	1
from	1
Elinor,	1
who	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
volunteer	1
all	1
the	1
information	1
about	1
her	1
mother's	1
health,	1
their	1
coming	1
to	1
town,	1
&c.	1
which	1
Edward	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
inquired	1
about,	1
but	1
never	1
did.	1
Her	1
exertions	1
did	1
not	1
stop	1
here;	1
for	1
she	1
soon	1
afterwards	1
felt	1
herself	1
so	1
heroically	1
disposed	1
as	1
to	1
determine,	1
under	1
pretence	1
of	1
fetching	1
Marianne,	1
to	1
leave	1
the	1
others	1
by	1
themselves;	1
and	1
she	1
really	1
did	1
it,	1
and	1
THAT	1
in	1
the	1
handsomest	1
manner,	1
for	1
she	1
loitered	1
away	1
several	1
minutes	1
on	1
the	1
landing-place,	1
with	1
the	1
most	1
high-minded	1
fortitude,	1
before	1
she	1
went	1
to	1
her	1
sister.	1
When	1
that	1
was	1
once	1
done,	1
however,	1
it	1
was	1
time	1
for	1
the	1
raptures	1
of	1
Edward	1
to	1
cease;	1
for	1
Marianne's	1
joy	1
hurried	1
her	1
into	1
the	1
drawing-room	1
immediately.	1
Her	1
pleasure	1
in	1
seeing	1
him	1
was	1
like	1
every	1
other	1
of	1
her	1
feelings,	1
strong	1
in	1
itself,	1
and	1
strongly	1
spoken.	1
She	1
met	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
hand	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
taken,	1
and	1
a	1
voice	1
that	1
expressed	1
the	1
affection	1
of	1
a	1
sister.	1
"Dear	1
Edward!"	1
she	1
cried,	1
"this	1
is	1
a	1
moment	1
of	1
great	1
happiness!--This	1
would	1
almost	1
make	1
amends	1
for	1
every	1
thing?"	1
Edward	1
tried	1
to	1
return	1
her	1
kindness	1
as	1
it	1
deserved,	1
but	1
before	1
such	1
witnesses	1
he	1
dared	1
not	1
say	1
half	1
what	1
he	1
really	1
felt.	1
Again	1
they	1
all	1
sat	1
down,	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
or	1
two	1
all	1
were	1
silent;	1
while	1
Marianne	1
was	1
looking	1
with	1
the	1
most	1
speaking	1
tenderness,	1
sometimes	1
at	1
Edward	1
and	1
sometimes	1
at	1
Elinor,	1
regretting	1
only	1
that	1
their	1
delight	1
in	1
each	1
other	1
should	1
be	1
checked	1
by	1
Lucy's	1
unwelcome	1
presence.	1
Edward	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
speak,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
notice	1
Marianne's	1
altered	1
looks,	1
and	1
express	1
his	1
fear	1
of	1
her	1
not	1
finding	1
London	1
agree	1
with	1
her.	1
"Oh,	1
don't	1
think	1
of	1
me!"	1
she	1
replied	1
with	1
spirited	1
earnestness,	1
though	1
her	1
eyes	1
were	1
filled	1
with	1
tears	1
as	1
she	1
spoke,	1
"don't	1
think	1
of	1
MY	1
health.	1
Elinor	1
is	1
well,	1
you	1
see.	1
That	1
must	1
be	1
enough	1
for	1
us	1
both."	1
This	1
remark	1
was	1
not	1
calculated	1
to	1
make	1
Edward	1
or	1
Elinor	1
more	1
easy,	1
nor	1
to	1
conciliate	1
the	1
good	1
will	1
of	1
Lucy,	1
who	1
looked	1
up	1
at	1
Marianne	1
with	1
no	1
very	1
benignant	1
expression.	1
"Do	1
you	1
like	1
London?"	1
said	1
Edward,	1
willing	1
to	1
say	1
any	1
thing	1
that	1
might	1
introduce	1
another	1
subject.	1
"Not	1
at	1
all.	1
I	1
expected	1
much	1
pleasure	1
in	1
it,	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
none.	1
The	1
sight	1
of	1
you,	1
Edward,	1
is	1
the	1
only	1
comfort	1
it	1
has	1
afforded;	1
and	1
thank	1
Heaven!	1
you	1
are	1
what	1
you	1
always	1
were!"	1
She	1
paused--no	1
one	1
spoke.	1
"I	1
think,	1
Elinor,"	1
she	1
presently	1
added,	1
"we	1
must	1
employ	1
Edward	1
to	1
take	1
care	1
of	1
us	1
in	1
our	1
return	1
to	1
Barton.	1
In	1
a	1
week	1
or	1
two,	1
I	1
suppose,	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
going;	1
and,	1
I	1
trust,	1
Edward	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
very	1
unwilling	1
to	1
accept	1
the	1
charge."	1
Poor	1
Edward	1
muttered	1
something,	1
but	1
what	1
it	1
was,	1
nobody	1
knew,	1
not	1
even	1
himself.	1
But	1
Marianne,	1
who	1
saw	1
his	1
agitation,	1
and	1
could	1
easily	1
trace	1
it	1
to	1
whatever	1
cause	1
best	1
pleased	1
herself,	1
was	1
perfectly	1
satisfied,	1
and	1
soon	1
talked	1
of	1
something	1
else.	1
"We	1
spent	1
such	1
a	1
day,	1
Edward,	1
in	1
Harley	1
Street	1
yesterday!	1
So	1
dull,	1
so	1
wretchedly	1
dull!--But	1
I	1
have	1
much	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
you	1
on	1
that	1
head,	1
which	1
cannot	1
be	1
said	1
now."	1
And	1
with	1
this	1
admirable	1
discretion	1
did	1
she	1
defer	1
the	1
assurance	1
of	1
her	1
finding	1
their	1
mutual	1
relatives	1
more	1
disagreeable	1
than	1
ever,	1
and	1
of	1
her	1
being	1
particularly	1
disgusted	1
with	1
his	1
mother,	1
till	1
they	1
were	1
more	1
in	1
private.	1
"But	1
why	1
were	1
you	1
not	1
there,	1
Edward?--Why	1
did	1
you	1
not	1
come?"	1
"I	1
was	1
engaged	1
elsewhere."	1
"Engaged!	1
But	1
what	1
was	1
that,	1
when	1
such	1
friends	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
met?"	1
"Perhaps,	1
Miss	1
Marianne,"	1
cried	1
Lucy,	1
eager	1
to	1
take	1
some	1
revenge	1
on	1
her,	1
"you	1
think	1
young	1
men	1
never	1
stand	1
upon	1
engagements,	1
if	1
they	1
have	1
no	1
mind	1
to	1
keep	1
them,	1
little	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
great."	1
Elinor	1
was	1
very	1
angry,	1
but	1
Marianne	1
seemed	1
entirely	1
insensible	1
of	1
the	1
sting;	1
for	1
she	1
calmly	1
replied,	1
"Not	1
so,	1
indeed;	1
for,	1
seriously	1
speaking,	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
sure	1
that	1
conscience	1
only	1
kept	1
Edward	1
from	1
Harley	1
Street.	1
And	1
I	1
really	1
believe	1
he	1
HAS	1
the	1
most	1
delicate	1
conscience	1
in	1
the	1
world;	1
the	1
most	1
scrupulous	1
in	1
performing	1
every	1
engagement,	1
however	1
minute,	1
and	1
however	1
it	1
may	1
make	1
against	1
his	1
interest	1
or	1
pleasure.	1
He	1
is	1
the	1
most	1
fearful	1
of	1
giving	1
pain,	1
of	1
wounding	1
expectation,	1
and	1
the	1
most	1
incapable	1
of	1
being	1
selfish,	1
of	1
any	1
body	1
I	1
ever	1
saw.	1
Edward,	1
it	1
is	1
so,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
say	1
it.	1
What!	1
are	1
you	1
never	1
to	1
hear	1
yourself	1
praised!--Then	1
you	1
must	1
be	1
no	1
friend	1
of	1
mine;	1
for	1
those	1
who	1
will	1
accept	1
of	1
my	1
love	1
and	1
esteem,	1
must	1
submit	1
to	1
my	1
open	1
commendation."	1
The	1
nature	1
of	1
her	1
commendation,	1
in	1
the	1
present	1
case,	1
however,	1
happened	1
to	1
be	1
particularly	1
ill-suited	1
to	1
the	1
feelings	1
of	1
two	1
thirds	1
of	1
her	1
auditors,	1
and	1
was	1
so	1
very	1
unexhilarating	1
to	1
Edward,	1
that	1
he	1
very	1
soon	1
got	1
up	1
to	1
go	1
away.	1
"Going	1
so	1
soon!"	1
said	1
Marianne;	1
"my	1
dear	1
Edward,	1
this	1
must	1
not	1
be."	1
And	1
drawing	1
him	1
a	1
little	1
aside,	1
she	1
whispered	1
her	1
persuasion	1
that	1
Lucy	1
could	1
not	1
stay	1
much	1
longer.	1
But	1
even	1
this	1
encouragement	1
failed,	1
for	1
he	1
would	1
go;	1
and	1
Lucy,	1
who	1
would	1
have	1
outstaid	1
him,	1
had	1
his	1
visit	1
lasted	1
two	1
hours,	1
soon	1
afterwards	1
went	1
away.	1
"What	1
can	1
bring	1
her	1
here	1
so	1
often?"	1
said	1
Marianne,	1
on	1
her	1
leaving	1
them.	1
"Could	1
not	1
she	1
see	1
that	1
we	1
wanted	1
her	1
gone!--how	1
teazing	1
to	1
Edward!"	1
"Why	1
so?--we	1
were	1
all	1
his	1
friends,	1
and	1
Lucy	1
has	1
been	1
the	1
longest	1
known	1
to	1
him	1
of	1
any.	1
It	1
is	1
but	1
natural	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
ourselves."	1
Marianne	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
steadily,	1
and	1
said,	1
"You	1
know,	1
Elinor,	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
talking	1
which	1
I	1
cannot	1
bear.	1
If	1
you	1
only	1
hope	1
to	1
have	1
your	1
assertion	1
contradicted,	1
as	1
I	1
must	1
suppose	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
case,	1
you	1
ought	1
to	1
recollect	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
last	1
person	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
do	1
it.	1
I	1
cannot	1
descend	1
to	1
be	1
tricked	1
out	1
of	1
assurances,	1
that	1
are	1
not	1
really	1
wanted."	1
She	1
then	1
left	1
the	1
room;	1
and	1
Elinor	1
dared	1
not	1
follow	1
her	1
to	1
say	1
more,	1
for	1
bound	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
by	1
her	1
promise	1
of	1
secrecy	1
to	1
Lucy,	1
she	1
could	1
give	1
no	1
information	1
that	1
would	1
convince	1
Marianne;	1
and	1
painful	1
as	1
the	1
consequences	1
of	1
her	1
still	1
continuing	1
in	1
an	1
error	1
might	1
be,	1
she	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
submit	1
to	1
it.	1
All	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
hope,	1
was	1
that	1
Edward	1
would	1
not	1
often	1
expose	1
her	1
or	1
himself	1
to	1
the	1
distress	1
of	1
hearing	1
Marianne's	1
mistaken	1
warmth,	1
nor	1
to	1
the	1
repetition	1
of	1
any	1
other	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
pain	1
that	1
had	1
attended	1
their	1
recent	1
meeting--and	1
this	1
she	1
had	1
every	1
reason	1
to	1
expect.	1
CHAPTER	1
36	1
Within	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
after	1
this	1
meeting,	1
the	1
newspapers	1
announced	1
to	1
the	1
world,	1
that	1
the	1
lady	1
of	1
Thomas	1
Palmer,	1
Esq.	1
was	1
safely	1
delivered	1
of	1
a	1
son	1
and	1
heir;	1
a	1
very	1
interesting	1
and	1
satisfactory	1
paragraph,	1
at	1
least	1
to	1
all	1
those	1
intimate	1
connections	1
who	1
knew	1
it	1
before.	1
This	1
event,	1
highly	1
important	1
to	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings's	1
happiness,	1
produced	1
a	1
temporary	1
alteration	1
in	1
the	1
disposal	1
of	1
her	1
time,	1
and	1
influenced,	1
in	1
a	1
like	1
degree,	1
the	1
engagements	1
of	1
her	1
young	1
friends;	1
for	1
as	1
she	1
wished	1
to	1
be	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
possible	1
with	1
Charlotte,	1
she	1
went	1
thither	1
every	1
morning	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
dressed,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
return	1
till	1
late	1
in	1
the	1
evening;	1
and	1
the	1
Miss	1
Dashwoods,	1
at	1
the	1
particular	1
request	1
of	1
the	1
Middletons,	1
spent	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
every	1
day,	1
in	1
every	1
day	1
in	1
Conduit	1
Street.	1
For	1
their	1
own	1
comfort	1
they	1
would	1
much	1
rather	1
have	1
remained,	1
at	1
least	1
all	1
the	1
morning,	1
in	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings's	1
house;	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
thing	1
to	1
be	1
urged	1
against	1
the	1
wishes	1
of	1
everybody.	1
Their	1
hours	1
were	1
therefore	1
made	1
over	1
to	1
Lady	1
Middleton	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
Miss	1
Steeles,	1
by	1
whom	1
their	1
company,	1
in	1
fact	1
was	1
as	1
little	1
valued,	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
professedly	1
sought.	1
They	1
had	1
too	1
much	1
sense	1
to	1
be	1
desirable	1
companions	1
to	1
the	1
former;	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
latter	1
they	1
were	1
considered	1
with	1
a	1
jealous	1
eye,	1
as	1
intruding	1
on	1
THEIR	1
ground,	1
and	1
sharing	1
the	1
kindness	1
which	1
they	1
wanted	1
to	1
monopolize.	1
Though	1
nothing	1
could	1
be	1
more	1
polite	1
than	1
Lady	1
Middleton's	1
behaviour	1
to	1
Elinor	1
and	1
Marianne,	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
really	1
like	1
them	1
at	1
all.	1
Because	1
they	1
neither	1
flattered	1
herself	1
nor	1
her	1
children,	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
believe	1
them	1
good-natured;	1
and	1
because	1
they	1
were	1
fond	1
of	1
reading,	1
she	1
fancied	1
them	1
satirical:	1
perhaps	1
without	1
exactly	1
knowing	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
satirical;	1
but	1
THAT	1
did	1
not	1
signify.	1
It	1
was	1
censure	1
in	1
common	1
use,	1
and	1
easily	1
given.	1
Their	1
presence	1
was	1
a	1
restraint	1
both	1
on	1
her	1
and	1
on	1
Lucy.	1
It	1
checked	1
the	1
idleness	1
of	1
one,	1
and	1
the	1
business	1
of	1
the	1
other.	1
Lady	1
Middleton	1
was	1
ashamed	1
of	1
doing	1
nothing	1
before	1
them,	1
and	1
the	1
flattery	1
which	1
Lucy	1
was	1
proud	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
and	1
administer	1
at	1
other	1
times,	1
she	1
feared	1
they	1
would	1
despise	1
her	1
for	1
offering.	1
Miss	1
Steele	1
was	1
the	1
least	1
discomposed	1
of	1
the	1
three,	1
by	1
their	1
presence;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
their	1
power	1
to	1
reconcile	1
her	1
to	1
it	1
entirely.	1
Would	1
either	1
of	1
them	1
only	1
have	1
given	1
her	1
a	1
full	1
and	1
minute	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
affair	1
between	1
Marianne	1
and	1
Mr.	1
Willoughby,	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
thought	1
herself	1
amply	1
rewarded	1
for	1
the	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
place	1
by	1
the	1
fire	1
after	1
dinner,	1
which	1
their	1
arrival	1
occasioned.	1
But	1
this	1
conciliation	1
was	1
not	1
granted;	1
for	1
though	1
she	1
often	1
threw	1
out	1
expressions	1
of	1
pity	1
for	1
her	1
sister	1
to	1
Elinor,	1
and	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
dropt	1
a	1
reflection	1
on	1
the	1
inconstancy	1
of	1
beaux	1
before	1
Marianne,	1
no	1
effect	1
was	1
produced,	1
but	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
indifference	1
from	1
the	1
former,	1
or	1
of	1
disgust	1
in	1
the	1
latter.	1
An	1
effort	1
even	1
yet	1
lighter	1
might	1
have	1
made	1
her	1
their	1
friend.	1
Would	1
they	1
only	1
have	1
laughed	1
at	1
her	1
about	1
the	1
Doctor!	1
But	1
so	1
little	1
were	1
they,	1
anymore	1
than	1
the	1
others,	1
inclined	1
to	1
oblige	1
her,	1
that	1
if	1
Sir	1
John	1
dined	1
from	1
home,	1
she	1
might	1
spend	1
a	1
whole	1
day	1
without	1
hearing	1
any	1
other	1
raillery	1
on	1
the	1
subject,	1
than	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
kind	1
enough	1
to	1
bestow	1
on	1
herself.	1
All	1
these	1
jealousies	1
and	1
discontents,	1
however,	1
were	1
so	1
totally	1
unsuspected	1
by	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings,	1
that	1
she	1
thought	1
it	1
a	1
delightful	1
thing	1
for	1
the	1
girls	1
to	1
be	1
together;	1
and	1
generally	1
congratulated	1
her	1
young	1
friends	1
every	1
night,	1
on	1
having	1
escaped	1
the	1
company	1
of	1
a	1
stupid	1
old	1
woman	1
so	1
long.	1
She	1
joined	1
them	1
sometimes	1
at	1
Sir	1
John's,	1
sometimes	1
at	1
her	1
own	1
house;	1
but	1
wherever	1
it	1
was,	1
she	1
always	1
came	1
in	1
excellent	1
spirits,	1
full	1
of	1
delight	1
and	1
importance,	1
attributing	1
Charlotte's	1
well	1
doing	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
care,	1
and	1
ready	1
to	1
give	1
so	1
exact,	1
so	1
minute	1
a	1
detail	1
of	1
her	1
situation,	1
as	1
only	1
Miss	1
Steele	1
had	1
curiosity	1
enough	1
to	1
desire.	1
One	1
thing	1
DID	1
disturb	1
her;	1
and	1
of	1
that	1
she	1
made	1
her	1
daily	1
complaint.	1
Mr.	1
Palmer	1
maintained	1
the	1
common,	1
but	1
unfatherly	1
opinion	1
among	1
his	1
sex,	1
of	1
all	1
infants	1
being	1
alike;	1
and	1
though	1
she	1
could	1
plainly	1
perceive,	1
at	1
different	1
times,	1
the	1
most	1
striking	1
resemblance	1
between	1
this	1
baby	1
and	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
relations	1
on	1
both	1
sides,	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
convincing	1
his	1
father	1
of	1
it;	1
no	1
persuading	1
him	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
exactly	1
like	1
every	1
other	1
baby	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
age;	1
nor	1
could	1
he	1
even	1
be	1
brought	1
to	1
acknowledge	1
the	1
simple	1
proposition	1
of	1
its	1
being	1
the	1
finest	1
child	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
I	1
come	1
now	1
to	1
the	1
relation	1
of	1
a	1
misfortune,	1
which	1
about	1
this	1
time	1
befell	1
Mrs.	1
John	1
Dashwood.	1
It	1
so	1
happened	1
that	1
while	1
her	1
two	1
sisters	1
with	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
were	1
first	1
calling	1
on	1
her	1
in	1
Harley	1
Street,	1
another	1
of	1
her	1
acquaintance	1
had	1
dropt	1
in--a	1
circumstance	1
in	1
itself	1
not	1
apparently	1
likely	1
to	1
produce	1
evil	1
to	1
her.	1
But	1
while	1
the	1
imaginations	1
of	1
other	1
people	1
will	1
carry	1
them	1
away	1
to	1
form	1
wrong	1
judgments	1
of	1
our	1
conduct,	1
and	1
to	1
decide	1
on	1
it	1
by	1
slight	1
appearances,	1
one's	1
happiness	1
must	1
in	1
some	1
measure	1
be	1
always	1
at	1
the	1
mercy	1
of	1
chance.	1
In	1
the	1
present	1
instance,	1
this	1
last-arrived	1
lady	1
allowed	1
her	1
fancy	1
to	1
so	1
far	1
outrun	1
truth	1
and	1
probability,	1
that	1
on	1
merely	1
hearing	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Miss	1
Dashwoods,	1
and	1
understanding	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
Mr.	1
Dashwood's	1
sisters,	1
she	1
immediately	1
concluded	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
staying	1
in	1
Harley	1
Street;	1
and	1
this	1
misconstruction	1
produced	1
within	1
a	1
day	1
or	1
two	1
afterwards,	1
cards	1
of	1
invitation	1
for	1
them	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
for	1
their	1
brother	1
and	1
sister,	1
to	1
a	1
small	1
musical	1
party	1
at	1
her	1
house.	1
The	1
consequence	1
of	1
which	1
was,	1
that	1
Mrs.	1
John	1
Dashwood	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
submit	1
not	1
only	1
to	1
the	1
exceedingly	1
great	1
inconvenience	1
of	1
sending	1
her	1
carriage	1
for	1
the	1
Miss	1
Dashwoods,	1
but,	1
what	1
was	1
still	1
worse,	1
must	1
be	1
subject	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
unpleasantness	1
of	1
appearing	1
to	1
treat	1
them	1
with	1
attention:	1
and	1
who	1
could	1
tell	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
not	1
expect	1
to	1
go	1
out	1
with	1
her	1
a	1
second	1
time?	1
The	1
power	1
of	1
disappointing	1
them,	1
it	1
was	1
true,	1
must	1
always	1
be	1
her's.	1
But	1
that	1
was	1
not	1
enough;	1
for	1
when	1
people	1
are	1
determined	1
on	1
a	1
mode	1
of	1
conduct	1
which	1
they	1
know	1
to	1
be	1
wrong,	1
they	1
feel	1
injured	1
by	1
the	1
expectation	1
of	1
any	1
thing	1
better	1
from	1
them.	1
Marianne	1
had	1
now	1
been	1
brought	1
by	1
degrees,	1
so	1
much	1
into	1
the	1
habit	1
of	1
going	1
out	1
every	1
day,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
become	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
indifference	1
to	1
her,	1
whether	1
she	1
went	1
or	1
not:	1
and	1
she	1
prepared	1
quietly	1
and	1
mechanically	1
for	1
every	1
evening's	1
engagement,	1
though	1
without	1
expecting	1
the	1
smallest	1
amusement	1
from	1
any,	1
and	1
very	1
often	1
without	1
knowing,	1
till	1
the	1
last	1
moment,	1
where	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
take	1
her.	1
To	1
her	1
dress	1
and	1
appearance	1
she	1
was	1
grown	1
so	1
perfectly	1
indifferent,	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
bestow	1
half	1
the	1
consideration	1
on	1
it,	1
during	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
her	1
toilet,	1
which	1
it	1
received	1
from	1
Miss	1
Steele	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
five	1
minutes	1
of	1
their	1
being	1
together,	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
finished.	1
Nothing	1
escaped	1
HER	1
minute	1
observation	1
and	1
general	1
curiosity;	1
she	1
saw	1
every	1
thing,	1
and	1
asked	1
every	1
thing;	1
was	1
never	1
easy	1
till	1
she	1
knew	1
the	1
price	1
of	1
every	1
part	1
of	1
Marianne's	1
dress;	1
could	1
have	1
guessed	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
her	1
gowns	1
altogether	1
with	1
better	1
judgment	1
than	1
Marianne	1
herself,	1
and	1
was	1
not	1
without	1
hopes	1
of	1
finding	1
out	1
before	1
they	1
parted,	1
how	1
much	1
her	1
washing	1
cost	1
per	1
week,	1
and	1
how	1
much	1
she	1
had	1
every	1
year	1
to	1
spend	1
upon	1
herself.	1
The	1
impertinence	1
of	1
these	1
kind	1
of	1
scrutinies,	1
moreover,	1
was	1
generally	1
concluded	1
with	1
a	1
compliment,	1
which	1
though	1
meant	1
as	1
its	1
douceur,	1
was	1
considered	1
by	1
Marianne	1
as	1
the	1
greatest	1
impertinence	1
of	1
all;	1
for	1
after	1
undergoing	1
an	1
examination	1
into	1
the	1
value	1
and	1
make	1
of	1
her	1
gown,	1
the	1
colour	1
of	1
her	1
shoes,	1
and	1
the	1
arrangement	1
of	1
her	1
hair,	1
she	1
was	1
almost	1
sure	1
of	1
being	1
told	1
that	1
upon	1
"her	1
word	1
she	1
looked	1
vastly	1
smart,	1
and	1
she	1
dared	1
to	1
say	1
she	1
would	1
make	1
a	1
great	1
many	1
conquests."	1
With	1
such	1
encouragement	1
as	1
this,	1
was	1
she	1
dismissed	1
on	1
the	1
present	1
occasion,	1
to	1
her	1
brother's	1
carriage;	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
ready	1
to	1
enter	1
five	1
minutes	1
after	1
it	1
stopped	1
at	1
the	1
door,	1
a	1
punctuality	1
not	1
very	1
agreeable	1
to	1
their	1
sister-in-law,	1
who	1
had	1
preceded	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
her	1
acquaintance,	1
and	1
was	1
there	1
hoping	1
for	1
some	1
delay	1
on	1
their	1
part	1
that	1
might	1
inconvenience	1
either	1
herself	1
or	1
her	1
coachman.	1
The	1
events	1
of	1
this	1
evening	1
were	1
not	1
very	1
remarkable.	1
The	1
party,	1
like	1
other	1
musical	1
parties,	1
comprehended	1
a	1
great	1
many	1
people	1
who	1
had	1
real	1
taste	1
for	1
the	1
performance,	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
many	1
more	1
who	1
had	1
none	1
at	1
all;	1
and	1
the	1
performers	1
themselves	1
were,	1
as	1
usual,	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
estimation,	1
and	1
that	1
of	1
their	1
immediate	1
friends,	1
the	1
first	1
private	1
performers	1
in	1
England.	1
As	1
Elinor	1
was	1
neither	1
musical,	1
nor	1
affecting	1
to	1
be	1
so,	1
she	1
made	1
no	1
scruple	1
of	1
turning	1
her	1
eyes	1
from	1
the	1
grand	1
pianoforte,	1
whenever	1
it	1
suited	1
her,	1
and	1
unrestrained	1
even	1
by	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
a	1
harp,	1
and	1
violoncello,	1
would	1
fix	1
them	1
at	1
pleasure	1
on	1
any	1
other	1
object	1
in	1
the	1
room.	1
In	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
excursive	1
glances	1
she	1
perceived	1
among	1
a	1
group	1
of	1
young	1
men,	1
the	1
very	1
he,	1
who	1
had	1
given	1
them	1
a	1
lecture	1
on	1
toothpick-cases	1
at	1
Gray's.	1
She	1
perceived	1
him	1
soon	1
afterwards	1
looking	1
at	1
herself,	1
and	1
speaking	1
familiarly	1
to	1
her	1
brother;	1
and	1
had	1
just	1
determined	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
his	1
name	1
from	1
the	1
latter,	1
when	1
they	1
both	1
came	1
towards	1
her,	1
and	1
Mr.	1
Dashwood	1
introduced	1
him	1
to	1
her	1
as	1
Mr.	1
Robert	1
Ferrars.	1
He	1
addressed	1
her	1
with	1
easy	1
civility,	1
and	1
twisted	1
his	1
head	1
into	1
a	1
bow	1
which	1
assured	1
her	1
as	1
plainly	1
as	1
words	1
could	1
have	1
done,	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
exactly	1
the	1
coxcomb	1
she	1
had	1
heard	1
him	1
described	1
to	1
be	1
by	1
Lucy.	1
Happy	1
had	1
it	1
been	1
for	1
her,	1
if	1
her	1
regard	1
for	1
Edward	1
had	1
depended	1
less	1
on	1
his	1
own	1
merit,	1
than	1
on	1
the	1
merit	1
of	1
his	1
nearest	1
relations!	1
For	1
then	1
his	1
brother's	1
bow	1
must	1
have	1
given	1
the	1
finishing	1
stroke	1
to	1
what	1
the	1
ill-humour	1
of	1
his	1
mother	1
and	1
sister	1
would	1
have	1
begun.	1
But	1
while	1
she	1
wondered	1
at	1
the	1
difference	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
young	1
men,	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
find	1
that	1
the	1
emptiness	1
of	1
conceit	1
of	1
the	1
one,	1
put	1
her	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
charity	1
with	1
the	1
modesty	1
and	1
worth	1
of	1
the	1
other.	1
Why	1
they	1
WERE	1
different,	1
Robert	1
exclaimed	1
to	1
her	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
a	1
quarter	1
of	1
an	1
hour's	1
conversation;	1
for,	1
talking	1
of	1
his	1
brother,	1
and	1
lamenting	1
the	1
extreme	1
GAUCHERIE	1
which	1
he	1
really	1
believed	1
kept	1
him	1
from	1
mixing	1
in	1
proper	1
society,	1
he	1
candidly	1
and	1
generously	1
attributed	1
it	1
much	1
less	1
to	1
any	1
natural	1
deficiency,	1
than	1
to	1
the	1
misfortune	1
of	1
a	1
private	1
education;	1
while	1
he	1
himself,	1
though	1
probably	1
without	1
any	1
particular,	1
any	1
material	1
superiority	1
by	1
nature,	1
merely	1
from	1
the	1
advantage	1
of	1
a	1
public	1
school,	1
was	1
as	1
well	1
fitted	1
to	1
mix	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
as	1
any	1
other	1
man.	1
"Upon	1
my	1
soul,"	1
he	1
added,	1
"I	1
believe	1
it	1
is	1
nothing	1
more;	1
and	1
so	1
I	1
often	1
tell	1
my	1
mother,	1
when	1
she	1
is	1
grieving	1
about	1
it.	1
'My	1
dear	1
Madam,'	1
I	1
always	1
say	1
to	1
her,	1
'you	1
must	1
make	1
yourself	1
easy.	1
The	1
evil	1
is	1
now	1
irremediable,	1
and	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
entirely	1
your	1
own	1
doing.	1
Why	1
would	1
you	1
be	1
persuaded	1
by	1
my	1
uncle,	1
Sir	1
Robert,	1
against	1
your	1
own	1
judgment,	1
to	1
place	1
Edward	1
under	1
private	1
tuition,	1
at	1
the	1
most	1
critical	1
time	1
of	1
his	1
life?	1
If	1
you	1
had	1
only	1
sent	1
him	1
to	1
Westminster	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
myself,	1
instead	1
of	1
sending	1
him	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Pratt's,	1
all	1
this	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
prevented.'	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
way	1
in	1
which	1
I	1
always	1
consider	1
the	1
matter,	1
and	1
my	1
mother	1
is	1
perfectly	1
convinced	1
of	1
her	1
error."	1
Elinor	1
would	1
not	1
oppose	1
his	1
opinion,	1
because,	1
whatever	1
might	1
be	1
her	1
general	1
estimation	1
of	1
the	1
advantage	1
of	1
a	1
public	1
school,	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
think	1
of	1
Edward's	1
abode	1
in	1
Mr.	1
Pratt's	1
family,	1
with	1
any	1
satisfaction.	1
"You	1
reside	1
in	1
Devonshire,	1
I	1
think,"--was	1
his	1
next	1
observation,	1
"in	1
a	1
cottage	1
near	1
Dawlish."	1
Elinor	1
set	1
him	1
right	1
as	1
to	1
its	1
situation;	1
and	1
it	1
seemed	1
rather	1
surprising	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
anybody	1
could	1
live	1
in	1
Devonshire,	1
without	1
living	1
near	1
Dawlish.	1
He	1
bestowed	1
his	1
hearty	1
approbation	1
however	1
on	1
their	1
species	1
of	1
house.	1
"For	1
my	1
own	1
part,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"I	1
am	1
excessively	1
fond	1
of	1
a	1
cottage;	1
there	1
is	1
always	1
so	1
much	1
comfort,	1
so	1
much	1
elegance	1
about	1
them.	1
And	1
I	1
protest,	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
any	1
money	1
to	1
spare,	1
I	1
should	1
buy	1
a	1
little	1
land	1
and	1
build	1
one	1
myself,	1
within	1
a	1
short	1
distance	1
of	1
London,	1
where	1
I	1
might	1
drive	1
myself	1
down	1
at	1
any	1
time,	1
and	1
collect	1
a	1
few	1
friends	1
about	1
me,	1
and	1
be	1
happy.	1
I	1
advise	1
every	1
body	1
who	1
is	1
going	1
to	1
build,	1
to	1
build	1
a	1
cottage.	1
My	1
friend	1
Lord	1
Courtland	1
came	1
to	1
me	1
the	1
other	1
day	1
on	1
purpose	1
to	1
ask	1
my	1
advice,	1
and	1
laid	1
before	1
me	1
three	1
different	1
plans	1
of	1
Bonomi's.	1
I	1
was	1
to	1
decide	1
on	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
them.	1
'My	1
dear	1
Courtland,'	1
said	1
I,	1
immediately	1
throwing	1
them	1
all	1
into	1
the	1
fire,	1
'do	1
not	1
adopt	1
either	1
of	1
them,	1
but	1
by	1
all	1
means	1
build	1
a	1
cottage.'	1
And	1
that	1
I	1
fancy,	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
it.	1
"Some	1
people	1
imagine	1
that	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
accommodations,	1
no	1
space	1
in	1
a	1
cottage;	1
but	1
this	1
is	1
all	1
a	1
mistake.	1
I	1
was	1
last	1
month	1
at	1
my	1
friend	1
Elliott's,	1
near	1
Dartford.	1
Lady	1
Elliott	1
wished	1
to	1
give	1
a	1
dance.	1
'But	1
how	1
can	1
it	1
be	1
done?'	1
said	1
she;	1
'my	1
dear	1
Ferrars,	1
do	1
tell	1
me	1
how	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
managed.	1
There	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
room	1
in	1
this	1
cottage	1
that	1
will	1
hold	1
ten	1
couple,	1
and	1
where	1
can	1
the	1
supper	1
be?'	1
I	1
immediately	1
saw	1
that	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
no	1
difficulty	1
in	1
it,	1
so	1
I	1
said,	1
'My	1
dear	1
Lady	1
Elliott,	1
do	1
not	1
be	1
uneasy.	1
The	1
dining	1
parlour	1
will	1
admit	1
eighteen	1
couple	1
with	1
ease;	1
card-tables	1
may	1
be	1
placed	1
in	1
the	1
drawing-room;	1
the	1
library	1
may	1
be	1
open	1
for	1
tea	1
and	1
other	1
refreshments;	1
and	1
let	1
the	1
supper	1
be	1
set	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
saloon.'	1
Lady	1
Elliott	1
was	1
delighted	1
with	1
the	1
thought.	1
We	1
measured	1
the	1
dining-room,	1
and	1
found	1
it	1
would	1
hold	1
exactly	1
eighteen	1
couple,	1
and	1
the	1
affair	1
was	1
arranged	1
precisely	1
after	1
my	1
plan.	1
So	1
that,	1
in	1
fact,	1
you	1
see,	1
if	1
people	1
do	1
but	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
set	1
about	1
it,	1
every	1
comfort	1
may	1
be	1
as	1
well	1
enjoyed	1
in	1
a	1
cottage	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
spacious	1
dwelling."	1
Elinor	1
agreed	1
to	1
it	1
all,	1
for	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
he	1
deserved	1
the	1
compliment	1
of	1
rational	1
opposition.	1
As	1
John	1
Dashwood	1
had	1
no	1
more	1
pleasure	1
in	1
music	1
than	1
his	1
eldest	1
sister,	1
his	1
mind	1
was	1
equally	1
at	1
liberty	1
to	1
fix	1
on	1
any	1
thing	1
else;	1
and	1
a	1
thought	1
struck	1
him	1
during	1
the	1
evening,	1
which	1
he	1
communicated	1
to	1
his	1
wife,	1
for	1
her	1
approbation,	1
when	1
they	1
got	1
home.	1
The	1
consideration	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
Dennison's	1
mistake,	1
in	1
supposing	1
his	1
sisters	1
their	1
guests,	1
had	1
suggested	1
the	1
propriety	1
of	1
their	1
being	1
really	1
invited	1
to	1
become	1
such,	1
while	1
Mrs.	1
Jenning's	1
engagements	1
kept	1
her	1
from	1
home.	1
The	1
expense	1
would	1
be	1
nothing,	1
the	1
inconvenience	1
not	1
more;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
altogether	1
an	1
attention	1
which	1
the	1
delicacy	1
of	1
his	1
conscience	1
pointed	1
out	1
to	1
be	1
requisite	1
to	1
its	1
complete	1
enfranchisement	1
from	1
his	1
promise	1
to	1
his	1
father.	1
Fanny	1
was	1
startled	1
at	1
the	1
proposal.	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
see	1
how	1
it	1
can	1
be	1
done,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"without	1
affronting	1
Lady	1
Middleton,	1
for	1
they	1
spend	1
every	1
day	1
with	1
her;	1
otherwise	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
exceedingly	1
glad	1
to	1
do	1
it.	1
You	1
know	1
I	1
am	1
always	1
ready	1
to	1
pay	1
them	1
any	1
attention	1
in	1
my	1
power,	1
as	1
my	1
taking	1
them	1
out	1
this	1
evening	1
shews.	1
But	1
they	1
are	1
Lady	1
Middleton's	1
visitors.	1
How	1
can	1
I	1
ask	1
them	1
away	1
from	1
her?"	1
Her	1
husband,	1
but	1
with	1
great	1
humility,	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
her	1
objection.	1
"They	1
had	1
already	1
spent	1
a	1
week	1
in	1
this	1
manner	1
in	1
Conduit	1
Street,	1
and	1
Lady	1
Middleton	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
displeased	1
at	1
their	1
giving	1
the	1
same	1
number	1
of	1
days	1
to	1
such	1
near	1
relations."	1
Fanny	1
paused	1
a	1
moment,	1
and	1
then,	1
with	1
fresh	1
vigor,	1
said,	1
"My	1
love	1
I	1
would	1
ask	1
them	1
with	1
all	1
my	1
heart,	1
if	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
my	1
power.	1
But	1
I	1
had	1
just	1
settled	1
within	1
myself	1
to	1
ask	1
the	1
Miss	1
Steeles	1
to	1
spend	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
with	1
us.	1
They	1
are	1
very	1
well	1
behaved,	1
good	1
kind	1
of	1
girls;	1
and	1
I	1
think	1
the	1
attention	1
is	1
due	1
to	1
them,	1
as	1
their	1
uncle	1
did	1
so	1
very	1
well	1
by	1
Edward.	1
We	1
can	1
ask	1
your	1
sisters	1
some	1
other	1
year,	1
you	1
know;	1
but	1
the	1
Miss	1
Steeles	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
in	1
town	1
any	1
more.	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
you	1
will	1
like	1
them;	1
indeed,	1
you	1
DO	1
like	1
them,	1
you	1
know,	1
very	1
much	1
already,	1
and	1
so	1
does	1
my	1
mother;	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
such	1
favourites	1
with	1
Harry!"	1
Mr.	1
Dashwood	1
was	1
convinced.	1
He	1
saw	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
inviting	1
the	1
Miss	1
Steeles	1
immediately,	1
and	1
his	1
conscience	1
was	1
pacified	1
by	1
the	1
resolution	1
of	1
inviting	1
his	1
sisters	1
another	1
year;	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
however,	1
slyly	1
suspecting	1
that	1
another	1
year	1
would	1
make	1
the	1
invitation	1
needless,	1
by	1
bringing	1
Elinor	1
to	1
town	1
as	1
Colonel	1
Brandon's	1
wife,	1
and	1
Marianne	1
as	1
THEIR	1
visitor.	1
Fanny,	1
rejoicing	1
in	1
her	1
escape,	1
and	1
proud	1
of	1
the	1
ready	1
wit	1
that	1
had	1
procured	1
it,	1
wrote	1
the	1
next	1
morning	1
to	1
Lucy,	1
to	1
request	1
her	1
company	1
and	1
her	1
sister's,	1
for	1
some	1
days,	1
in	1
Harley	1
Street,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
Lady	1
Middleton	1
could	1
spare	1
them.	1
This	1
was	1
enough	1
to	1
make	1
Lucy	1
really	1
and	1
reasonably	1
happy.	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood	1
seemed	1
actually	1
working	1
for	1
her,	1
herself;	1
cherishing	1
all	1
her	1
hopes,	1
and	1
promoting	1
all	1
her	1
views!	1
Such	1
an	1
opportunity	1
of	1
being	1
with	1
Edward	1
and	1
his	1
family	1
was,	1
above	1
all	1
things,	1
the	1
most	1
material	1
to	1
her	1
interest,	1
and	1
such	1
an	1
invitation	1
the	1
most	1
gratifying	1
to	1
her	1
feelings!	1
It	1
was	1
an	1
advantage	1
that	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
too	1
gratefully	1
acknowledged,	1
nor	1
too	1
speedily	1
made	1
use	1
of;	1
and	1
the	1
visit	1
to	1
Lady	1
Middleton,	1
which	1
had	1
not	1
before	1
had	1
any	1
precise	1
limits,	1
was	1
instantly	1
discovered	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
always	1
meant	1
to	1
end	1
in	1
two	1
days'	1
time.	1
When	1
the	1
note	1
was	1
shown	1
to	1
Elinor,	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
within	1
ten	1
minutes	1
after	1
its	1
arrival,	1
it	1
gave	1
her,	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time,	1
some	1
share	1
in	1
the	1
expectations	1
of	1
Lucy;	1
for	1
such	1
a	1
mark	1
of	1
uncommon	1
kindness,	1
vouchsafed	1
on	1
so	1
short	1
an	1
acquaintance,	1
seemed	1
to	1
declare	1
that	1
the	1
good-will	1
towards	1
her	1
arose	1
from	1
something	1
more	1
than	1
merely	1
malice	1
against	1
herself;	1
and	1
might	1
be	1
brought,	1
by	1
time	1
and	1
address,	1
to	1
do	1
every	1
thing	1
that	1
Lucy	1
wished.	1
Her	1
flattery	1
had	1
already	1
subdued	1
the	1
pride	1
of	1
Lady	1
Middleton,	1
and	1
made	1
an	1
entry	1
into	1
the	1
close	1
heart	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
John	1
Dashwood;	1
and	1
these	1
were	1
effects	1
that	1
laid	1
open	1
the	1
probability	1
of	1
greater.	1
The	1
Miss	1
Steeles	1
removed	1
to	1
Harley	1
Street,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
reached	1
Elinor	1
of	1
their	1
influence	1
there,	1
strengthened	1
her	1
expectation	1
of	1
the	1
event.	1
Sir	1
John,	1
who	1
called	1
on	1
them	1
more	1
than	1
once,	1
brought	1
home	1
such	1
accounts	1
of	1
the	1
favour	1
they	1
were	1
in,	1
as	1
must	1
be	1
universally	1
striking.	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
so	1
much	1
pleased	1
with	1
any	1
young	1
women	1
in	1
her	1
life,	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
with	1
them;	1
had	1
given	1
each	1
of	1
them	1
a	1
needle	1
book	1
made	1
by	1
some	1
emigrant;	1
called	1
Lucy	1
by	1
her	1
Christian	1
name;	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
whether	1
she	1
should	1
ever	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
part	1
with	1
them.	1

CHAPTER	1
37	1
Mrs.	1
Palmer	1
was	1
so	1
well	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
a	1
fortnight,	1
that	1
her	1
mother	1
felt	1
it	1
no	1
longer	1
necessary	1
to	1
give	1
up	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
her	1
time	1
to	1
her;	1
and,	1
contenting	1
herself	1
with	1
visiting	1
her	1
once	1
or	1
twice	1
a	1
day,	1
returned	1
from	1
that	1
period	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
home,	1
and	1
her	1
own	1
habits,	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
found	1
the	1
Miss	1
Dashwoods	1
very	1
ready	1
to	1
resume	1
their	1
former	1
share.	1
About	1
the	1
third	1
or	1
fourth	1
morning	1
after	1
their	1
being	1
thus	1
resettled	1
in	1
Berkeley	1
Street,	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings,	1
on	1
returning	1
from	1
her	1
ordinary	1
visit	1
to	1
Mrs.	1
Palmer,	1
entered	1
the	1
drawing-room,	1
where	1
Elinor	1
was	1
sitting	1
by	1
herself,	1
with	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
such	1
hurrying	1
importance	1
as	1
prepared	1
her	1
to	1
hear	1
something	1
wonderful;	1
and	1
giving	1
her	1
time	1
only	1
to	1
form	1
that	1
idea,	1
began	1
directly	1
to	1
justify	1
it,	1
by	1
saying,	1
"Lord!	1
my	1
dear	1
Miss	1
Dashwood!	1
have	1
you	1
heard	1
the	1
news?"	1
"No,	1
ma'am.	1
What	1
is	1
it?"	1
"Something	1
so	1
strange!	1
But	1
you	1
shall	1
hear	1
it	1
all.--	1
When	1
I	1
got	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Palmer's,	1
I	1
found	1
Charlotte	1
quite	1
in	1
a	1
fuss	1
about	1
the	1
child.	1
She	1
was	1
sure	1
it	1
was	1
very	1
ill--it	1
cried,	1
and	1
fretted,	1
and	1
was	1
all	1
over	1
pimples.	1
So	1
I	1
looked	1
at	1
it	1
directly,	1
and,	1
'Lord!	1
my	1
dear,'	1
says	1
I,	1
'it	1
is	1
nothing	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
but	1
the	1
red	1
gum--'	1
and	1
nurse	1
said	1
just	1
the	1
same.	1
But	1
Charlotte,	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
satisfied,	1
so	1
Mr.	1
Donavan	1
was	1
sent	1
for;	1
and	1
luckily	1
he	1
happened	1
to	1
just	1
come	1
in	1
from	1
Harley	1
Street,	1
so	1
he	1
stepped	1
over	1
directly,	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
ever	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
child,	1
be	1
said	1
just	1
as	1
we	1
did,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
nothing	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
but	1
the	1
red	1
gum,	1
and	1
then	1
Charlotte	1
was	1
easy.	1
And	1
so,	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
away	1
again,	1
it	1
came	1
into	1
my	1
head,	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
I	1
happened	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
it,	1
but	1
it	1
came	1
into	1
my	1
head	1
to	1
ask	1
him	1
if	1
there	1
was	1
any	1
news.	1
So	1
upon	1
that,	1
he	1
smirked,	1
and	1
simpered,	1
and	1
looked	1
grave,	1
and	1
seemed	1
to	1
know	1
something	1
or	1
other,	1
and	1
at	1
last	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
whisper,	1
'For	1
fear	1
any	1
unpleasant	1
report	1
should	1
reach	1
the	1
young	1
ladies	1
under	1
your	1
care	1
as	1
to	1
their	1
sister's	1
indisposition,	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
advisable	1
to	1
say,	1
that	1
I	1
believe	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
great	1
reason	1
for	1
alarm;	1
I	1
hope	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood	1
will	1
do	1
very	1
well.'"	1
"What!	1
is	1
Fanny	1
ill?"	1
"That	1
is	1
exactly	1
what	1
I	1
said,	1
my	1
dear.	1
'Lord!'	1
says	1
I,	1
'is	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood	1
ill?'	1
So	1
then	1
it	1
all	1
came	1
out;	1
and	1
the	1
long	1
and	1
the	1
short	1
of	1
the	1
matter,	1
by	1
all	1
I	1
can	1
learn,	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
this.	1
Mr.	1
Edward	1
Ferrars,	1
the	1
very	1
young	1
man	1
I	1
used	1
to	1
joke	1
with	1
you	1
about	1
(but	1
however,	1
as	1
it	1
turns	1
out,	1
I	1
am	1
monstrous	1
glad	1
there	1
was	1
never	1
any	1
thing	1
in	1
it),	1
Mr.	1
Edward	1
Ferrars,	1
it	1
seems,	1
has	1
been	1
engaged	1
above	1
this	1
twelvemonth	1
to	1
my	1
cousin	1
Lucy!--There's	1
for	1
you,	1
my	1
dear!--And	1
not	1
a	1
creature	1
knowing	1
a	1
syllable	1
of	1
the	1
matter,	1
except	1
Nancy!--Could	1
you	1
have	1
believed	1
such	1
a	1
thing	1
possible?--	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
great	1
wonder	1
in	1
their	1
liking	1
one	1
another;	1
but	1
that	1
matters	1
should	1
be	1
brought	1
so	1
forward	1
between	1
them,	1
and	1
nobody	1
suspect	1
it!--THAT	1
is	1
strange!--I	1
never	1
happened	1
to	1
see	1
them	1
together,	1
or	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
found	1
it	1
out	1
directly.	1
Well,	1
and	1
so	1
this	1
was	1
kept	1
a	1
great	1
secret,	1
for	1
fear	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
Ferrars,	1
and	1
neither	1
she	1
nor	1
your	1
brother	1
or	1
sister	1
suspected	1
a	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
matter;--	1
till	1
this	1
very	1
morning,	1
poor	1
Nancy,	1
who,	1
you	1
know,	1
is	1
a	1
well-meaning	1
creature,	1
but	1
no	1
conjurer,	1
popt	1
it	1
all	1
out.	1
'Lord!'	1
thinks	1
she	1
to	1
herself,	1
'they	1
are	1
all	1
so	1
fond	1
of	1
Lucy,	1
to	1
be	1
sure	1
they	1
will	1
make	1
no	1
difficulty	1
about	1
it;'	1
and	1
so,	1
away	1
she	1
went	1
to	1
your	1
sister,	1
who	1
was	1
sitting	1
all	1
alone	1
at	1
her	1
carpet-work,	1
little	1
suspecting	1
what	1
was	1
to	1
come--for	1
she	1
had	1
just	1
been	1
saying	1
to	1
your	1
brother,	1
only	1
five	1
minutes	1
before,	1
that	1
she	1
thought	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
match	1
between	1
Edward	1
and	1
some	1
Lord's	1
daughter	1
or	1
other,	1
I	1
forget	1
who.	1
So	1
you	1
may	1
think	1
what	1
a	1
blow	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
all	1
her	1
vanity	1
and	1
pride.	1
She	1
fell	1
into	1
violent	1
hysterics	1
immediately,	1
with	1
such	1
screams	1
as	1
reached	1
your	1
brother's	1
ears,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
sitting	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
dressing-room	1
down	1
stairs,	1
thinking	1
about	1
writing	1
a	1
letter	1
to	1
his	1
steward	1
in	1
the	1
country.	1
So	1
up	1
he	1
flew	1
directly,	1
and	1
a	1
terrible	1
scene	1
took	1
place,	1
for	1
Lucy	1
was	1
come	1
to	1
them	1
by	1
that	1
time,	1
little	1
dreaming	1
what	1
was	1
going	1
on.	1
Poor	1
soul!	1
I	1
pity	1
HER.	1
And	1
I	1
must	1
say,	1
I	1
think	1
she	1
was	1
used	1
very	1
hardly;	1
for	1
your	1
sister	1
scolded	1
like	1
any	1
fury,	1
and	1
soon	1
drove	1
her	1
into	1
a	1
fainting	1
fit.	1
Nancy,	1
she	1
fell	1
upon	1
her	1
knees,	1
and	1
cried	1
bitterly;	1
and	1
your	1
brother,	1
he	1
walked	1
about	1
the	1
room,	1
and	1
said	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
do.	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood	1
declared	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
stay	1
a	1
minute	1
longer	1
in	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
your	1
brother	1
was	1
forced	1
to	1
go	1
down	1
upon	1
HIS	1
knees	1
too,	1
to	1
persuade	1
her	1
to	1
let	1
them	1
stay	1
till	1
they	1
had	1
packed	1
up	1
their	1
clothes.	1
THEN	1
she	1
fell	1
into	1
hysterics	1
again,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
frightened	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
send	1
for	1
Mr.	1
Donavan,	1
and	1
Mr.	1
Donavan	1
found	1
the	1
house	1
in	1
all	1
this	1
uproar.	1
The	1
carriage	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
ready	1
to	1
take	1
my	1
poor	1
cousins	1
away,	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
just	1
stepping	1
in	1
as	1
he	1
came	1
off;	1
poor	1
Lucy	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
condition,	1
he	1
says,	1
she	1
could	1
hardly	1
walk;	1
and	1
Nancy,	1
she	1
was	1
almost	1
as	1
bad.	1
I	1
declare,	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
patience	1
with	1
your	1
sister;	1
and	1
I	1
hope,	1
with	1
all	1
my	1
heart,	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
match	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
her.	1
Lord!	1
what	1
a	1
taking	1
poor	1
Mr.	1
Edward	1
will	1
be	1
in	1
when	1
he	1
hears	1
of	1
it!	1
To	1
have	1
his	1
love	1
used	1
so	1
scornfully!	1
for	1
they	1
say	1
he	1
is	1
monstrous	1
fond	1
of	1
her,	1
as	1
well	1
he	1
may.	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
wonder,	1
if	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
greatest	1
passion!--and	1
Mr.	1
Donavan	1
thinks	1
just	1
the	1
same.	1
He	1
and	1
I	1
had	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
talk	1
about	1
it;	1
and	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
all	1
is,	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
gone	1
back	1
again	1
to	1
Harley	1
Street,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
be	1
within	1
call	1
when	1
Mrs.	1
Ferrars	1
is	1
told	1
of	1
it,	1
for	1
she	1
was	1
sent	1
for	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
ever	1
my	1
cousins	1
left	1
the	1
house,	1
for	1
your	1
sister	1
was	1
sure	1
SHE	1
would	1
be	1
in	1
hysterics	1
too;	1
and	1
so	1
she	1
may,	1
for	1
what	1
I	1
care.	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
pity	1
for	1
either	1
of	1
them.	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
notion	1
of	1
people's	1
making	1
such	1
a	1
to-do	1
about	1
money	1
and	1
greatness.	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
reason	1
on	1
earth	1
why	1
Mr.	1
Edward	1
and	1
Lucy	1
should	1
not	1
marry;	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
Mrs.	1
Ferrars	1
may	1
afford	1
to	1
do	1
very	1
well	1
by	1
her	1
son,	1
and	1
though	1
Lucy	1
has	1
next	1
to	1
nothing	1
herself,	1
she	1
knows	1
better	1
than	1
any	1
body	1
how	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
most	1
of	1
every	1
thing;	1
I	1
dare	1
say,	1
if	1
Mrs.	1
Ferrars	1
would	1
only	1
allow	1
him	1
five	1
hundred	1
a-year,	1
she	1
would	1
make	1
as	1
good	1
an	1
appearance	1
with	1
it	1
as	1
any	1
body	1
else	1
would	1
with	1
eight.	1
Lord!	1
how	1
snug	1
they	1
might	1
live	1
in	1
such	1
another	1
cottage	1
as	1
yours--or	1
a	1
little	1
bigger--with	1
two	1
maids,	1
and	1
two	1
men;	1
and	1
I	1
believe	1
I	1
could	1
help	1
them	1
to	1
a	1
housemaid,	1
for	1
my	1
Betty	1
has	1
a	1
sister	1
out	1
of	1
place,	1
that	1
would	1
fit	1
them	1
exactly."	1
Here	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
ceased,	1
and	1
as	1
Elinor	1
had	1
had	1
time	1
enough	1
to	1
collect	1
her	1
thoughts,	1
she	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
give	1
such	1
an	1
answer,	1
and	1
make	1
such	1
observations,	1
as	1
the	1
subject	1
might	1
naturally	1
be	1
supposed	1
to	1
produce.	1
Happy	1
to	1
find	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
suspected	1
of	1
any	1
extraordinary	1
interest	1
in	1
it;	1
that	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
(as	1
she	1
had	1
of	1
late	1
often	1
hoped	1
might	1
be	1
the	1
case)	1
had	1
ceased	1
to	1
imagine	1
her	1
at	1
all	1
attached	1
to	1
Edward;	1
and	1
happy	1
above	1
all	1
the	1
rest,	1
in	1
the	1
absence	1
of	1
Marianne,	1
she	1
felt	1
very	1
well	1
able	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
the	1
affair	1
without	1
embarrassment,	1
and	1
to	1
give	1
her	1
judgment,	1
as	1
she	1
believed,	1
with	1
impartiality	1
on	1
the	1
conduct	1
of	1
every	1
one	1
concerned	1
in	1
it.	1
She	1
could	1
hardly	1
determine	1
what	1
her	1
own	1
expectation	1
of	1
its	1
event	1
really	1
was;	1
though	1
she	1
earnestly	1
tried	1
to	1
drive	1
away	1
the	1
notion	1
of	1
its	1
being	1
possible	1
to	1
end	1
otherwise	1
at	1
last,	1
than	1
in	1
the	1
marriage	1
of	1
Edward	1
and	1
Lucy.	1
What	1
Mrs.	1
Ferrars	1
would	1
say	1
and	1
do,	1
though	1
there	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
a	1
doubt	1
of	1
its	1
nature,	1
she	1
was	1
anxious	1
to	1
hear;	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
anxious	1
to	1
know	1
how	1
Edward	1
would	1
conduct	1
himself.	1
For	1
HIM	1
she	1
felt	1
much	1
compassion;--	1
for	1
Lucy	1
very	1
little--and	1
it	1
cost	1
her	1
some	1
pains	1
to	1
procure	1
that	1
little;--for	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
party	1
none	1
at	1
all.	1
As	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
could	1
talk	1
on	1
no	1
other	1
subject,	1
Elinor	1
soon	1
saw	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
preparing	1
Marianne	1
for	1
its	1
discussion.	1
No	1
time	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
lost	1
in	1
undeceiving	1
her,	1
in	1
making	1
her	1
acquainted	1
with	1
the	1
real	1
truth,	1
and	1
in	1
endeavouring	1
to	1
bring	1
her	1
to	1
hear	1
it	1
talked	1
of	1
by	1
others,	1
without	1
betraying	1
that	1
she	1
felt	1
any	1
uneasiness	1
for	1
her	1
sister,	1
or	1
any	1
resentment	1
against	1
Edward.	1
Elinor's	1
office	1
was	1
a	1
painful	1
one.--She	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
remove	1
what	1
she	1
really	1
believed	1
to	1
be	1
her	1
sister's	1
chief	1
consolation,--to	1
give	1
such	1
particulars	1
of	1
Edward	1
as	1
she	1
feared	1
would	1
ruin	1
him	1
for	1
ever	1
in	1
her	1
good	1
opinion,-and	1
to	1
make	1
Marianne,	1
by	1
a	1
resemblance	1
in	1
their	1
situations,	1
which	1
to	1
HER	1
fancy	1
would	1
seem	1
strong,	1
feel	1
all	1
her	1
own	1
disappointment	1
over	1
again.	1
But	1
unwelcome	1
as	1
such	1
a	1
task	1
must	1
be,	1
it	1
was	1
necessary	1
to	1
be	1
done,	1
and	1
Elinor	1
therefore	1
hastened	1
to	1
perform	1
it.	1
She	1
was	1
very	1
far	1
from	1
wishing	1
to	1
dwell	1
on	1
her	1
own	1
feelings,	1
or	1
to	1
represent	1
herself	1
as	1
suffering	1
much,	1
any	1
otherwise	1
than	1
as	1
the	1
self-command	1
she	1
had	1
practised	1
since	1
her	1
first	1
knowledge	1
of	1
Edward's	1
engagement,	1
might	1
suggest	1
a	1
hint	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
practicable	1
to	1
Marianne.	1
Her	1
narration	1
was	1
clear	1
and	1
simple;	1
and	1
though	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
given	1
without	1
emotion,	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
accompanied	1
by	1
violent	1
agitation,	1
nor	1
impetuous	1
grief.--THAT	1
belonged	1
rather	1
to	1
the	1
hearer,	1
for	1
Marianne	1
listened	1
with	1
horror,	1
and	1
cried	1
excessively.	1
Elinor	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
comforter	1
of	1
others	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
distresses,	1
no	1
less	1
than	1
in	1
theirs;	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
comfort	1
that	1
could	1
be	1
given	1
by	1
assurances	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
composure	1
of	1
mind,	1
and	1
a	1
very	1
earnest	1
vindication	1
of	1
Edward	1
from	1
every	1
charge	1
but	1
of	1
imprudence,	1
was	1
readily	1
offered.	1
But	1
Marianne	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
would	1
give	1
credit	1
to	1
neither.	1
Edward	1
seemed	1
a	1
second	1
Willoughby;	1
and	1
acknowledging	1
as	1
Elinor	1
did,	1
that	1
she	1
HAD	1
loved	1
him	1
most	1
sincerely,	1
could	1
she	1
feel	1
less	1
than	1
herself!	1
As	1
for	1
Lucy	1
Steele,	1
she	1
considered	1
her	1
so	1
totally	1
unamiable,	1
so	1
absolutely	1
incapable	1
of	1
attaching	1
a	1
sensible	1
man,	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
persuaded	1
at	1
first	1
to	1
believe,	1
and	1
afterwards	1
to	1
pardon,	1
any	1
former	1
affection	1
of	1
Edward	1
for	1
her.	1
She	1
would	1
not	1
even	1
admit	1
it	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
natural;	1
and	1
Elinor	1
left	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
convinced	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
so,	1
by	1
that	1
which	1
only	1
could	1
convince	1
her,	1
a	1
better	1
knowledge	1
of	1
mankind.	1
Her	1
first	1
communication	1
had	1
reached	1
no	1
farther	1
than	1
to	1
state	1
the	1
fact	1
of	1
the	1
engagement,	1
and	1
the	1
length	1
of	1
time	1
it	1
had	1
existed.--Marianne's	1
feelings	1
had	1
then	1
broken	1
in,	1
and	1
put	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
all	1
regularity	1
of	1
detail;	1
and	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
all	1
that	1
could	1
be	1
done	1
was	1
to	1
soothe	1
her	1
distress,	1
lessen	1
her	1
alarms,	1
and	1
combat	1
her	1
resentment.	1
The	1
first	1
question	1
on	1
her	1
side,	1
which	1
led	1
to	1
farther	1
particulars,	1
was,	1
"How	1
long	1
has	1
this	1
been	1
known	1
to	1
you,	1
Elinor?	1
has	1
he	1
written	1
to	1
you?"	1
"I	1
have	1
known	1
it	1
these	1
four	1
months.	1
When	1
Lucy	1
first	1
came	1
to	1
Barton	1
Park	1
last	1
November,	1
she	1
told	1
me	1
in	1
confidence	1
of	1
her	1
engagement."	1
At	1
these	1
words,	1
Marianne's	1
eyes	1
expressed	1
the	1
astonishment	1
which	1
her	1
lips	1
could	1
not	1
utter.	1
After	1
a	1
pause	1
of	1
wonder,	1
she	1
exclaimed--	1
"Four	1
months!--Have	1
you	1
known	1
of	1
this	1
four	1
months?"	1
Elinor	1
confirmed	1
it.	1
"What!--while	1
attending	1
me	1
in	1
all	1
my	1
misery,	1
has	1
this	1
been	1
on	1
your	1
heart?--And	1
I	1
have	1
reproached	1
you	1
for	1
being	1
happy!"--	1
"It	1
was	1
not	1
fit	1
that	1
you	1
should	1
then	1
know	1
how	1
much	1
I	1
was	1
the	1
reverse!"	1
"Four	1
months!"--cried	1
Marianne	1
again.--"So	1
calm!--	1
so	1
cheerful!--how	1
have	1
you	1
been	1
supported?"--	1
"By	1
feeling	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
doing	1
my	1
duty.--My	1
promise	1
to	1
Lucy,	1
obliged	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
secret.	1
I	1
owed	1
it	1
to	1
her,	1
therefore,	1
to	1
avoid	1
giving	1
any	1
hint	1
of	1
the	1
truth;	1
and	1
I	1
owed	1
it	1
to	1
my	1
family	1
and	1
friends,	1
not	1
to	1
create	1
in	1
them	1
a	1
solicitude	1
about	1
me,	1
which	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
in	1
my	1
power	1
to	1
satisfy."	1
Marianne	1
seemed	1
much	1
struck.	1
"I	1
have	1
very	1
often	1
wished	1
to	1
undeceive	1
yourself	1
and	1
my	1
mother,"	1
added	1
Elinor;	1
"and	1
once	1
or	1
twice	1
I	1
have	1
attempted	1
it;--	1
but	1
without	1
betraying	1
my	1
trust,	1
I	1
never	1
could	1
have	1
convinced	1
you."	1
"Four	1
months!--and	1
yet	1
you	1
loved	1
him!"--	1
"Yes.	1
But	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
love	1
only	1
him;--and	1
while	1
the	1
comfort	1
of	1
others	1
was	1
dear	1
to	1
me,	1
I	1
was	1
glad	1
to	1
spare	1
them	1
from	1
knowing	1
how	1
much	1
I	1
felt.	1
Now,	1
I	1
can	1
think	1
and	1
speak	1
of	1
it	1
with	1
little	1
emotion.	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
you	1
suffer	1
on	1
my	1
account;	1
for	1
I	1
assure	1
you	1
I	1
no	1
longer	1
suffer	1
materially	1
myself.	1
I	1
have	1
many	1
things	1
to	1
support	1
me.	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
conscious	1
of	1
having	1
provoked	1
the	1
disappointment	1
by	1
any	1
imprudence	1
of	1
my	1
own,	1
I	1
have	1
borne	1
it	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
possible	1
without	1
spreading	1
it	1
farther.	1
I	1
acquit	1
Edward	1
of	1
essential	1
misconduct.	1
I	1
wish	1
him	1
very	1
happy;	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
so	1
sure	1
of	1
his	1
always	1
doing	1
his	1
duty,	1
that	1
though	1
now	1
he	1
may	1
harbour	1
some	1
regret,	1
in	1
the	1
end	1
he	1
must	1
become	1
so.	1
Lucy	1
does	1
not	1
want	1
sense,	1
and	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
foundation	1
on	1
which	1
every	1
thing	1
good	1
may	1
be	1
built.--And	1
after	1
all,	1
Marianne,	1
after	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
bewitching	1
in	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
a	1
single	1
and	1
constant	1
attachment,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
can	1
be	1
said	1
of	1
one's	1
happiness	1
depending	1
entirely	1
on	1
any	1
particular	1
person,	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
meant--it	1
is	1
not	1
fit--it	1
is	1
not	1
possible	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
so.--	1
Edward	1
will	1
marry	1
Lucy;	1
he	1
will	1
marry	1
a	1
woman	1
superior	1
in	1
person	1
and	1
understanding	1
to	1
half	1
her	1
sex;	1
and	1
time	1
and	1
habit	1
will	1
teach	1
him	1
to	1
forget	1
that	1
he	1
ever	1
thought	1
another	1
superior	1
to	1
HER."--	1
"If	1
such	1
is	1
your	1
way	1
of	1
thinking,"	1
said	1
Marianne,	1
"if	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
what	1
is	1
most	1
valued	1
is	1
so	1
easily	1
to	1
be	1
made	1
up	1
by	1
something	1
else,	1
your	1
resolution,	1
your	1
self-command,	1
are,	1
perhaps,	1
a	1
little	1
less	1
to	1
be	1
wondered	1
at.--They	1
are	1
brought	1
more	1
within	1
my	1
comprehension."	1
"I	1
understand	1
you.--You	1
do	1
not	1
suppose	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
ever	1
felt	1
much.--For	1
four	1
months,	1
Marianne,	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
all	1
this	1
hanging	1
on	1
my	1
mind,	1
without	1
being	1
at	1
liberty	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
it	1
to	1
a	1
single	1
creature;	1
knowing	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
make	1
you	1
and	1
my	1
mother	1
most	1
unhappy	1
whenever	1
it	1
were	1
explained	1
to	1
you,	1
yet	1
unable	1
to	1
prepare	1
you	1
for	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
least.--	1
It	1
was	1
told	1
me,--it	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
manner	1
forced	1
on	1
me	1
by	1
the	1
very	1
person	1
herself,	1
whose	1
prior	1
engagement	1
ruined	1
all	1
my	1
prospects;	1
and	1
told	1
me,	1
as	1
I	1
thought,	1
with	1
triumph.--	1
This	1
person's	1
suspicions,	1
therefore,	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
to	1
oppose,	1
by	1
endeavouring	1
to	1
appear	1
indifferent	1
where	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
most	1
deeply	1
interested;--and	1
it	1
has	1
not	1
been	1
only	1
once;--I	1
have	1
had	1
her	1
hopes	1
and	1
exultation	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
again	1
and	1
again.--	1
I	1
have	1
known	1
myself	1
to	1
be	1
divided	1
from	1
Edward	1
for	1
ever,	1
without	1
hearing	1
one	1
circumstance	1
that	1
could	1
make	1
me	1
less	1
desire	1
the	1
connection.--Nothing	1
has	1
proved	1
him	1
unworthy;	1
nor	1
has	1
anything	1
declared	1
him	1
indifferent	1
to	1
me.--	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
to	1
contend	1
against	1
the	1
unkindness	1
of	1
his	1
sister,	1
and	1
the	1
insolence	1
of	1
his	1
mother;	1
and	1
have	1
suffered	1
the	1
punishment	1
of	1
an	1
attachment,	1
without	1
enjoying	1
its	1
advantages.--	1
And	1
all	1
this	1
has	1
been	1
going	1
on	1
at	1
a	1
time,	1
when,	1
as	1
you	1
know	1
too	1
well,	1
it	1
has	1
not	1
been	1
my	1
only	1
unhappiness.--	1
If	1
you	1
can	1
think	1
me	1
capable	1
of	1
ever	1
feeling--surely	1
you	1
may	1
suppose	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
suffered	1
NOW.	1
The	1
composure	1
of	1
mind	1
with	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
brought	1
myself	1
at	1
present	1
to	1
consider	1
the	1
matter,	1
the	1
consolation	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
willing	1
to	1
admit,	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
effect	1
of	1
constant	1
and	1
painful	1
exertion;--they	1
did	1
not	1
spring	1
up	1
of	1
themselves;--	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
occur	1
to	1
relieve	1
my	1
spirits	1
at	1
first.--	1
No,	1
Marianne.--THEN,	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
bound	1
to	1
silence,	1
perhaps	1
nothing	1
could	1
have	1
kept	1
me	1
entirely--not	1
even	1
what	1
I	1
owed	1
to	1
my	1
dearest	1
friends--from	1
openly	1
shewing	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
VERY	1
unhappy."--	1
Marianne	1
was	1
quite	1
subdued.--	1
"Oh!	1
Elinor,"	1
she	1
cried,	1
"you	1
have	1
made	1
me	1
hate	1
myself	1
for	1
ever.--How	1
barbarous	1
have	1
I	1
been	1
to	1
you!--	1
you,	1
who	1
have	1
been	1
my	1
only	1
comfort,	1
who	1
have	1
borne	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
all	1
my	1
misery,	1
who	1
have	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
only	1
suffering	1
for	1
me!--Is	1
this	1
my	1
gratitude?--Is	1
this	1
the	1
only	1
return	1
I	1
can	1
make	1
you?--Because	1
your	1
merit	1
cries	1
out	1
upon	1
myself,	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
trying	1
to	1
do	1
it	1
away."	1
The	1
tenderest	1
caresses	1
followed	1
this	1
confession.	1
In	1
such	1
a	1
frame	1
of	1
mind	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
now	1
in,	1
Elinor	1
had	1
no	1
difficulty	1
in	1
obtaining	1
from	1
her	1
whatever	1
promise	1
she	1
required;	1
and	1
at	1
her	1
request,	1
Marianne	1
engaged	1
never	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
the	1
affair	1
to	1
any	1
one	1
with	1
the	1
least	1
appearance	1
of	1
bitterness;--to	1
meet	1
Lucy	1
without	1
betraying	1
the	1
smallest	1
increase	1
of	1
dislike	1
to	1
her;--and	1
even	1
to	1
see	1
Edward	1
himself,	1
if	1
chance	1
should	1
bring	1
them	1
together,	1
without	1
any	1
diminution	1
of	1
her	1
usual	1
cordiality.--	1
These	1
were	1
great	1
concessions;--but	1
where	1
Marianne	1
felt	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
injured,	1
no	1
reparation	1
could	1
be	1
too	1
much	1
for	1
her	1
to	1
make.	1
She	1
performed	1
her	1
promise	1
of	1
being	1
discreet,	1
to	1
admiration.--She	1
attended	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
had	1
to	1
say	1
upon	1
the	1
subject,	1
with	1
an	1
unchanging	1
complexion,	1
dissented	1
from	1
her	1
in	1
nothing,	1
and	1
was	1
heard	1
three	1
times	1
to	1
say,	1
"Yes,	1
ma'am."--She	1
listened	1
to	1
her	1
praise	1
of	1
Lucy	1
with	1
only	1
moving	1
from	1
one	1
chair	1
to	1
another,	1
and	1
when	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
talked	1
of	1
Edward's	1
affection,	1
it	1
cost	1
her	1
only	1
a	1
spasm	1
in	1
her	1
throat.--Such	1
advances	1
towards	1
heroism	1
in	1
her	1
sister,	1
made	1
Elinor	1
feel	1
equal	1
to	1
any	1
thing	1
herself.	1
The	1
next	1
morning	1
brought	1
a	1
farther	1
trial	1
of	1
it,	1
in	1
a	1
visit	1
from	1
their	1
brother,	1
who	1
came	1
with	1
a	1
most	1
serious	1
aspect	1
to	1
talk	1
over	1
the	1
dreadful	1
affair,	1
and	1
bring	1
them	1
news	1
of	1
his	1
wife.	1
"You	1
have	1
heard,	1
I	1
suppose,"	1
said	1
he	1
with	1
great	1
solemnity,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
seated,	1
"of	1
the	1
very	1
shocking	1
discovery	1
that	1
took	1
place	1
under	1
our	1
roof	1
yesterday."	1
They	1
all	1
looked	1
their	1
assent;	1
it	1
seemed	1
too	1
awful	1
a	1
moment	1
for	1
speech.	1
"Your	1
sister,"	1
he	1
continued,	1
"has	1
suffered	1
dreadfully.	1
Mrs.	1
Ferrars	1
too--in	1
short	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
a	1
scene	1
of	1
such	1
complicated	1
distress--but	1
I	1
will	1
hope	1
that	1
the	1
storm	1
may	1
be	1
weathered	1
without	1
our	1
being	1
any	1
of	1
us	1
quite	1
overcome.	1
Poor	1
Fanny!	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
hysterics	1
all	1
yesterday.	1
But	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
alarm	1
you	1
too	1
much.	1
Donavan	1
says	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
materially	1
to	1
be	1
apprehended;	1
her	1
constitution	1
is	1
a	1
good	1
one,	1
and	1
her	1
resolution	1
equal	1
to	1
any	1
thing.	1
She	1
has	1
borne	1
it	1
all,	1
with	1
the	1
fortitude	1
of	1
an	1
angel!	1
She	1
says	1
she	1
never	1
shall	1
think	1
well	1
of	1
anybody	1
again;	1
and	1
one	1
cannot	1
wonder	1
at	1
it,	1
after	1
being	1
so	1
deceived!--	1
meeting	1
with	1
such	1
ingratitude,	1
where	1
so	1
much	1
kindness	1
had	1
been	1
shewn,	1
so	1
much	1
confidence	1
had	1
been	1
placed!	1
It	1
was	1
quite	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
benevolence	1
of	1
her	1
heart,	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
asked	1
these	1
young	1
women	1
to	1
her	1
house;	1
merely	1
because	1
she	1
thought	1
they	1
deserved	1
some	1
attention,	1
were	1
harmless,	1
well-behaved	1
girls,	1
and	1
would	1
be	1
pleasant	1
companions;	1
for	1
otherwise	1
we	1
both	1
wished	1
very	1
much	1
to	1
have	1
invited	1
you	1
and	1
Marianne	1
to	1
be	1
with	1
us,	1
while	1
your	1
kind	1
friend	1
there,	1
was	1
attending	1
her	1
daughter.	1
And	1
now	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
rewarded!	1
'I	1
wish,	1
with	1
all	1
my	1
heart,'	1
says	1
poor	1
Fanny	1
in	1
her	1
affectionate	1
way,	1
'that	1
we	1
had	1
asked	1
your	1
sisters	1
instead	1
of	1
them.'"	1
Here	1
he	1
stopped	1
to	1
be	1
thanked;	1
which	1
being	1
done,	1
he	1
went	1
on.	1
"What	1
poor	1
Mrs.	1
Ferrars	1
suffered,	1
when	1
first	1
Fanny	1
broke	1
it	1
to	1
her,	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
described.	1
While	1
she	1
with	1
the	1
truest	1
affection	1
had	1
been	1
planning	1
a	1
most	1
eligible	1
connection	1
for	1
him,	1
was	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
supposed	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
be	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
secretly	1
engaged	1
to	1
another	1
person!--such	1
a	1
suspicion	1
could	1
never	1
have	1
entered	1
her	1
head!	1
If	1
she	1
suspected	1
ANY	1
prepossession	1
elsewhere,	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
in	1
THAT	1
quarter.	1
'THERE,	1
to	1
be	1
sure,'	1
said	1
she,	1
'I	1
might	1
have	1
thought	1
myself	1
safe.'	1
She	1
was	1
quite	1
in	1
an	1
agony.	1
We	1
consulted	1
together,	1
however,	1
as	1
to	1
what	1
should	1
be	1
done,	1
and	1
at	1
last	1
she	1
determined	1
to	1
send	1
for	1
Edward.	1
He	1
came.	1
But	1
I	1
am	1
sorry	1
to	1
relate	1
what	1
ensued.	1
All	1
that	1
Mrs.	1
Ferrars	1
could	1
say	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
put	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
the	1
engagement,	1
assisted	1
too	1
as	1
you	1
may	1
well	1
suppose	1
by	1
my	1
arguments,	1
and	1
Fanny's	1
entreaties,	1
was	1
of	1
no	1
avail.	1
Duty,	1
affection,	1
every	1
thing	1
was	1
disregarded.	1
I	1
never	1
thought	1
Edward	1
so	1
stubborn,	1
so	1
unfeeling	1
before.	1
His	1
mother	1
explained	1
to	1
him	1
her	1
liberal	1
designs,	1
in	1
case	1
of	1
his	1
marrying	1
Miss	1
Morton;	1
told	1
him	1
she	1
would	1
settle	1
on	1
him	1
the	1
Norfolk	1
estate,	1
which,	1
clear	1
of	1
land-tax,	1
brings	1
in	1
a	1
good	1
thousand	1
a-year;	1
offered	1
even,	1
when	1
matters	1
grew	1
desperate,	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
twelve	1
hundred;	1
and	1
in	1
opposition	1
to	1
this,	1
if	1
he	1
still	1
persisted	1
in	1
this	1
low	1
connection,	1
represented	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
certain	1
penury	1
that	1
must	1
attend	1
the	1
match.	1
His	1
own	1
two	1
thousand	1
pounds	1
she	1
protested	1
should	1
be	1
his	1
all;	1
she	1
would	1
never	1
see	1
him	1
again;	1
and	1
so	1
far	1
would	1
she	1
be	1
from	1
affording	1
him	1
the	1
smallest	1
assistance,	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
any	1
profession	1
with	1
a	1
view	1
of	1
better	1
support,	1
she	1
would	1
do	1
all	1
in	1
her	1
power	1
to	1
prevent	1
him	1
advancing	1
in	1
it."	1
Here	1
Marianne,	1
in	1
an	1
ecstasy	1
of	1
indignation,	1
clapped	1
her	1
hands	1
together,	1
and	1
cried,	1
"Gracious	1
God!	1
can	1
this	1
be	1
possible!"	1
"Well	1
may	1
you	1
wonder,	1
Marianne,"	1
replied	1
her	1
brother,	1
"at	1
the	1
obstinacy	1
which	1
could	1
resist	1
such	1
arguments	1
as	1
these.	1
Your	1
exclamation	1
is	1
very	1
natural."	1
Marianne	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
retort,	1
but	1
she	1
remembered	1
her	1
promises,	1
and	1
forbore.	1
"All	1
this,	1
however,"	1
he	1
continued,	1
"was	1
urged	1
in	1
vain.	1
Edward	1
said	1
very	1
little;	1
but	1
what	1
he	1
did	1
say,	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
determined	1
manner.	1
Nothing	1
should	1
prevail	1
on	1
him	1
to	1
give	1
up	1
his	1
engagement.	1
He	1
would	1
stand	1
to	1
it,	1
cost	1
him	1
what	1
it	1
might."	1
"Then,"	1
cried	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
with	1
blunt	1
sincerity,	1
no	1
longer	1
able	1
to	1
be	1
silent,	1
"he	1
has	1
acted	1
like	1
an	1
honest	1
man!	1
I	1
beg	1
your	1
pardon,	1
Mr.	1
Dashwood,	1
but	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
otherwise,	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
thought	1
him	1
a	1
rascal.	1
I	1
have	1
some	1
little	1
concern	1
in	1
the	1
business,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
yourself,	1
for	1
Lucy	1
Steele	1
is	1
my	1
cousin,	1
and	1
I	1
believe	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
better	1
kind	1
of	1
girl	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
nor	1
one	1
who	1
more	1
deserves	1
a	1
good	1
husband."	1
John	1
Dashwood	1
was	1
greatly	1
astonished;	1
but	1
his	1
nature	1
was	1
calm,	1
not	1
open	1
to	1
provocation,	1
and	1
he	1
never	1
wished	1
to	1
offend	1
anybody,	1
especially	1
anybody	1
of	1
good	1
fortune.	1
He	1
therefore	1
replied,	1
without	1
any	1
resentment,	1
"I	1
would	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
speak	1
disrespectfully	1
of	1
any	1
relation	1
of	1
yours,	1
madam.	1
Miss	1
Lucy	1
Steele	1
is,	1
I	1
dare	1
say,	1
a	1
very	1
deserving	1
young	1
woman,	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
present	1
case	1
you	1
know,	1
the	1
connection	1
must	1
be	1
impossible.	1
And	1
to	1
have	1
entered	1
into	1
a	1
secret	1
engagement	1
with	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
under	1
her	1
uncle's	1
care,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
a	1
woman	1
especially	1
of	1
such	1
very	1
large	1
fortune	1
as	1
Mrs.	1
Ferrars,	1
is	1
perhaps,	1
altogether	1
a	1
little	1
extraordinary.	1
In	1
short,	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
mean	1
to	1
reflect	1
upon	1
the	1
behaviour	1
of	1
any	1
person	1
whom	1
you	1
have	1
a	1
regard	1
for,	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings.	1
We	1
all	1
wish	1
her	1
extremely	1
happy;	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Ferrars's	1
conduct	1
throughout	1
the	1
whole,	1
has	1
been	1
such	1
as	1
every	1
conscientious,	1
good	1
mother,	1
in	1
like	1
circumstances,	1
would	1
adopt.	1
It	1
has	1
been	1
dignified	1
and	1
liberal.	1
Edward	1
has	1
drawn	1
his	1
own	1
lot,	1
and	1
I	1
fear	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
bad	1
one."	1
Marianne	1
sighed	1
out	1
her	1
similar	1
apprehension;	1
and	1
Elinor's	1
heart	1
wrung	1
for	1
the	1
feelings	1
of	1
Edward,	1
while	1
braving	1
his	1
mother's	1
threats,	1
for	1
a	1
woman	1
who	1
could	1
not	1
reward	1
him.	1
"Well,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings,	1
"and	1
how	1
did	1
it	1
end?"	1
"I	1
am	1
sorry	1
to	1
say,	1
ma'am,	1
in	1
a	1
most	1
unhappy	1
rupture:--	1
Edward	1
is	1
dismissed	1
for	1
ever	1
from	1
his	1
mother's	1
notice.	1
He	1
left	1
her	1
house	1
yesterday,	1
but	1
where	1
he	1
is	1
gone,	1
or	1
whether	1
he	1
is	1
still	1
in	1
town,	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know;	1
for	1
WE	1
of	1
course	1
can	1
make	1
no	1
inquiry."	1
"Poor	1
young	1
man!--and	1
what	1
is	1
to	1
become	1
of	1
him?"	1
"What,	1
indeed,	1
ma'am!	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
melancholy	1
consideration.	1
Born	1
to	1
the	1
prospect	1
of	1
such	1
affluence!	1
I	1
cannot	1
conceive	1
a	1
situation	1
more	1
deplorable.	1
The	1
interest	1
of	1
two	1
thousand	1
pounds--how	1
can	1
a	1
man	1
live	1
on	1
it?--and	1
when	1
to	1
that	1
is	1
added	1
the	1
recollection,	1
that	1
he	1
might,	1
but	1
for	1
his	1
own	1
folly,	1
within	1
three	1
months	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
receipt	1
of	1
two	1
thousand,	1
five	1
hundred	1
a-year	1
(for	1
Miss	1
Morton	1
has	1
thirty	1
thousand	1
pounds,)	1
I	1
cannot	1
picture	1
to	1
myself	1
a	1
more	1
wretched	1
condition.	1
We	1
must	1
all	1
feel	1
for	1
him;	1
and	1
the	1
more	1
so,	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
totally	1
out	1
of	1
our	1
power	1
to	1
assist	1
him."	1
"Poor	1
young	1
man!"	1
cried	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings,	1
"I	1
am	1
sure	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
very	1
welcome	1
to	1
bed	1
and	1
board	1
at	1
my	1
house;	1
and	1
so	1
I	1
would	1
tell	1
him	1
if	1
I	1
could	1
see	1
him.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
fit	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
living	1
about	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
charge	1
now,	1
at	1
lodgings	1
and	1
taverns."	1
Elinor's	1
heart	1
thanked	1
her	1
for	1
such	1
kindness	1
towards	1
Edward,	1
though	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
forbear	1
smiling	1
at	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
it.	1
"If	1
he	1
would	1
only	1
have	1
done	1
as	1
well	1
by	1
himself,"	1
said	1
John	1
Dashwood,	1
"as	1
all	1
his	1
friends	1
were	1
disposed	1
to	1
do	1
by	1
him,	1
he	1
might	1
now	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
his	1
proper	1
situation,	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
wanted	1
for	1
nothing.	1
But	1
as	1
it	1
is,	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
out	1
of	1
anybody's	1
power	1
to	1
assist	1
him.	1
And	1
there	1
is	1
one	1
thing	1
more	1
preparing	1
against	1
him,	1
which	1
must	1
be	1
worse	1
than	1
all--his	1
mother	1
has	1
determined,	1
with	1
a	1
very	1
natural	1
kind	1
of	1
spirit,	1
to	1
settle	1
THAT	1
estate	1
upon	1
Robert	1
immediately,	1
which	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
Edward's,	1
on	1
proper	1
conditions.	1
I	1
left	1
her	1
this	1
morning	1
with	1
her	1
lawyer,	1
talking	1
over	1
the	1
business."	1
"Well!"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings,	1
"that	1
is	1
HER	1
revenge.	1
Everybody	1
has	1
a	1
way	1
of	1
their	1
own.	1
But	1
I	1
don't	1
think	1
mine	1
would	1
be,	1
to	1
make	1
one	1
son	1
independent,	1
because	1
another	1
had	1
plagued	1
me."	1
Marianne	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
walked	1
about	1
the	1
room.	1
"Can	1
anything	1
be	1
more	1
galling	1
to	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
a	1
man,"	1
continued	1
John,	1
"than	1
to	1
see	1
his	1
younger	1
brother	1
in	1
possession	1
of	1
an	1
estate	1
which	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
his	1
own?	1
Poor	1
Edward!	1
I	1
feel	1
for	1
him	1
sincerely."	1
A	1
few	1
minutes	1
more	1
spent	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
kind	1
of	1
effusion,	1
concluded	1
his	1
visit;	1
and	1
with	1
repeated	1
assurances	1
to	1
his	1
sisters	1
that	1
he	1
really	1
believed	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
material	1
danger	1
in	1
Fanny's	1
indisposition,	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
need	1
not	1
therefore	1
be	1
very	1
uneasy	1
about	1
it,	1
he	1
went	1
away;	1
leaving	1
the	1
three	1
ladies	1
unanimous	1
in	1
their	1
sentiments	1
on	1
the	1
present	1
occasion,	1
as	1
far	1
at	1
least	1
as	1
it	1
regarded	1
Mrs.	1
Ferrars's	1
conduct,	1
the	1
Dashwoods',	1
and	1
Edward's.	1
Marianne's	1
indignation	1
burst	1
forth	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
quitted	1
the	1
room;	1
and	1
as	1
her	1
vehemence	1
made	1
reserve	1
impossible	1
in	1
Elinor,	1
and	1
unnecessary	1
in	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings,	1
they	1
all	1
joined	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
spirited	1
critique	1
upon	1
the	1
party.	1
CHAPTER	1
38	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
was	1
very	1
warm	1
in	1
her	1
praise	1
of	1
Edward's	1
conduct,	1
but	1
only	1
Elinor	1
and	1
Marianne	1
understood	1
its	1
true	1
merit.	1
THEY	1
only	1
knew	1
how	1
little	1
he	1
had	1
had	1
to	1
tempt	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
disobedient,	1
and	1
how	1
small	1
was	1
the	1
consolation,	1
beyond	1
the	1
consciousness	1
of	1
doing	1
right,	1
that	1
could	1
remain	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
friends	1
and	1
fortune.	1
Elinor	1
gloried	1
in	1
his	1
integrity;	1
and	1
Marianne	1
forgave	1
all	1
his	1
offences	1
in	1
compassion	1
for	1
his	1
punishment.	1
But	1
though	1
confidence	1
between	1
them	1
was,	1
by	1
this	1
public	1
discovery,	1
restored	1
to	1
its	1
proper	1
state,	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
subject	1
on	1
which	1
either	1
of	1
them	1
were	1
fond	1
of	1
dwelling	1
when	1
alone.	1
Elinor	1
avoided	1
it	1
upon	1
principle,	1
as	1
tending	1
to	1
fix	1
still	1
more	1
upon	1
her	1
thoughts,	1
by	1
the	1
too	1
warm,	1
too	1
positive	1
assurances	1
of	1
Marianne,	1
that	1
belief	1
of	1
Edward's	1
continued	1
affection	1
for	1
herself	1
which	1
she	1
rather	1
wished	1
to	1
do	1
away;	1
and	1
Marianne's	1
courage	1
soon	1
failed	1
her,	1
in	1
trying	1
to	1
converse	1
upon	1
a	1
topic	1
which	1
always	1
left	1
her	1
more	1
dissatisfied	1
with	1
herself	1
than	1
ever,	1
by	1
the	1
comparison	1
it	1
necessarily	1
produced	1
between	1
Elinor's	1
conduct	1
and	1
her	1
own.	1
She	1
felt	1
all	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
that	1
comparison;	1
but	1
not	1
as	1
her	1
sister	1
had	1
hoped,	1
to	1
urge	1
her	1
to	1
exertion	1
now;	1
she	1
felt	1
it	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
pain	1
of	1
continual	1
self-reproach,	1
regretted	1
most	1
bitterly	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
never	1
exerted	1
herself	1
before;	1
but	1
it	1
brought	1
only	1
the	1
torture	1
of	1
penitence,	1
without	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
amendment.	1
Her	1
mind	1
was	1
so	1
much	1
weakened	1
that	1
she	1
still	1
fancied	1
present	1
exertion	1
impossible,	1
and	1
therefore	1
it	1
only	1
dispirited	1
her	1
more.	1
Nothing	1
new	1
was	1
heard	1
by	1
them,	1
for	1
a	1
day	1
or	1
two	1
afterwards,	1
of	1
affairs	1
in	1
Harley	1
Street,	1
or	1
Bartlett's	1
Buildings.	1
But	1
though	1
so	1
much	1
of	1
the	1
matter	1
was	1
known	1
to	1
them	1
already,	1
that	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
might	1
have	1
had	1
enough	1
to	1
do	1
in	1
spreading	1
that	1
knowledge	1
farther,	1
without	1
seeking	1
after	1
more,	1
she	1
had	1
resolved	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
pay	1
a	1
visit	1
of	1
comfort	1
and	1
inquiry	1
to	1
her	1
cousins	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
could;	1
and	1
nothing	1
but	1
the	1
hindrance	1
of	1
more	1
visitors	1
than	1
usual,	1
had	1
prevented	1
her	1
going	1
to	1
them	1
within	1
that	1
time.	1
The	1
third	1
day	1
succeeding	1
their	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
particulars,	1
was	1
so	1
fine,	1
so	1
beautiful	1
a	1
Sunday	1
as	1
to	1
draw	1
many	1
to	1
Kensington	1
Gardens,	1
though	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
the	1
second	1
week	1
in	1
March.	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
and	1
Elinor	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
number;	1
but	1
Marianne,	1
who	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
Willoughbys	1
were	1
again	1
in	1
town,	1
and	1
had	1
a	1
constant	1
dread	1
of	1
meeting	1
them,	1
chose	1
rather	1
to	1
stay	1
at	1
home,	1
than	1
venture	1
into	1
so	1
public	1
a	1
place.	1
An	1
intimate	1
acquaintance	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
joined	1
them	1
soon	1
after	1
they	1
entered	1
the	1
Gardens,	1
and	1
Elinor	1
was	1
not	1
sorry	1
that	1
by	1
her	1
continuing	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
engaging	1
all	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings's	1
conversation,	1
she	1
was	1
herself	1
left	1
to	1
quiet	1
reflection.	1
She	1
saw	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
Willoughbys,	1
nothing	1
of	1
Edward,	1
and	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
nothing	1
of	1
anybody	1
who	1
could	1
by	1
any	1
chance	1
whether	1
grave	1
or	1
gay,	1
be	1
interesting	1
to	1
her.	1
But	1
at	1
last	1
she	1
found	1
herself	1
with	1
some	1
surprise,	1
accosted	1
by	1
Miss	1
Steele,	1
who,	1
though	1
looking	1
rather	1
shy,	1
expressed	1
great	1
satisfaction	1
in	1
meeting	1
them,	1
and	1
on	1
receiving	1
encouragement	1
from	1
the	1
particular	1
kindness	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings,	1
left	1
her	1
own	1
party	1
for	1
a	1
short	1
time,	1
to	1
join	1
their's.	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
immediately	1
whispered	1
to	1
Elinor,	1
"Get	1
it	1
all	1
out	1
of	1
her,	1
my	1
dear.	1
She	1
will	1
tell	1
you	1
any	1
thing	1
if	1
you	1
ask.	1
You	1
see	1
I	1
cannot	1
leave	1
Mrs.	1
Clarke."	1
It	1
was	1
lucky,	1
however,	1
for	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings's	1
curiosity	1
and	1
Elinor's	1
too,	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
tell	1
any	1
thing	1
WITHOUT	1
being	1
asked;	1
for	1
nothing	1
would	1
otherwise	1
have	1
been	1
learnt.	1
"I	1
am	1
so	1
glad	1
to	1
meet	1
you;"	1
said	1
Miss	1
Steele,	1
taking	1
her	1
familiarly	1
by	1
the	1
arm--"for	1
I	1
wanted	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
of	1
all	1
things	1
in	1
the	1
world."	1
And	1
then	1
lowering	1
her	1
voice,	1
"I	1
suppose	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
has	1
heard	1
all	1
about	1
it.	1
Is	1
she	1
angry?"	1
"Not	1
at	1
all,	1
I	1
believe,	1
with	1
you."	1
"That	1
is	1
a	1
good	1
thing.	1
And	1
Lady	1
Middleton,	1
is	1
SHE	1
angry?"	1
"I	1
cannot	1
suppose	1
it	1
possible	1
that	1
she	1
should."	1
"I	1
am	1
monstrous	1
glad	1
of	1
it.	1
Good	1
gracious!	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
such	1
a	1
time	1
of	1
it!	1
I	1
never	1
saw	1
Lucy	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
rage	1
in	1
my	1
life.	1
She	1
vowed	1
at	1
first	1
she	1
would	1
never	1
trim	1
me	1
up	1
a	1
new	1
bonnet,	1
nor	1
do	1
any	1
thing	1
else	1
for	1
me	1
again,	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
she	1
lived;	1
but	1
now	1
she	1
is	1
quite	1
come	1
to,	1
and	1
we	1
are	1
as	1
good	1
friends	1
as	1
ever.	1
Look,	1
she	1
made	1
me	1
this	1
bow	1
to	1
my	1
hat,	1
and	1
put	1
in	1
the	1
feather	1
last	1
night.	1
There	1
now,	1
YOU	1
are	1
going	1
to	1
laugh	1
at	1
me	1
too.	1
But	1
why	1
should	1
not	1
I	1
wear	1
pink	1
ribbons?	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
care	1
if	1
it	1
IS	1
the	1
Doctor's	1
favourite	1
colour.	1
I	1
am	1
sure,	1
for	1
my	1
part,	1
I	1
should	1
never	1
have	1
known	1
he	1
DID	1
like	1
it	1
better	1
than	1
any	1
other	1
colour,	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
happened	1
to	1
say	1
so.	1
My	1
cousins	1
have	1
been	1
so	1
plaguing	1
me!	1
I	1
declare	1
sometimes	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
which	1
way	1
to	1
look	1
before	1
them."	1
She	1
had	1
wandered	1
away	1
to	1
a	1
subject	1
on	1
which	1
Elinor	1
had	1
nothing	1
to	1
say,	1
and	1
therefore	1
soon	1
judged	1
it	1
expedient	1
to	1
find	1
her	1
way	1
back	1
again	1
to	1
the	1
first.	1
"Well,	1
but	1
Miss	1
Dashwood,"	1
speaking	1
triumphantly,	1
"people	1
may	1
say	1
what	1
they	1
chuse	1
about	1
Mr.	1
Ferrars's	1
declaring	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
Lucy,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
such	1
thing	1
I	1
can	1
tell	1
you;	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
quite	1
a	1
shame	1
for	1
such	1
ill-natured	1
reports	1
to	1
be	1
spread	1
abroad.	1
Whatever	1
Lucy	1
might	1
think	1
about	1
it	1
herself,	1
you	1
know,	1
it	1
was	1
no	1
business	1
of	1
other	1
people	1
to	1
set	1
it	1
down	1
for	1
certain."	1
"I	1
never	1
heard	1
any	1
thing	1
of	1
the	1
kind	1
hinted	1
at	1
before,	1
I	1
assure	1
you,"	1
said	1
Elinor.	1
"Oh,	1
did	1
not	1
you?	1
But	1
it	1
WAS	1
said,	1
I	1
know,	1
very	1
well,	1
and	1
by	1
more	1
than	1
one;	1
for	1
Miss	1
Godby	1
told	1
Miss	1
Sparks,	1
that	1
nobody	1
in	1
their	1
senses	1
could	1
expect	1
Mr.	1
Ferrars	1
to	1
give	1
up	1
a	1
woman	1
like	1
Miss	1
Morton,	1
with	1
thirty	1
thousand	1
pounds	1
to	1
her	1
fortune,	1
for	1
Lucy	1
Steele	1
that	1
had	1
nothing	1
at	1
all;	1
and	1
I	1
had	1
it	1
from	1
Miss	1
Sparks	1
myself.	1
And	1
besides	1
that,	1
my	1
cousin	1
Richard	1
said	1
himself,	1
that	1
when	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
point	1
he	1
was	1
afraid	1
Mr.	1
Ferrars	1
would	1
be	1
off;	1
and	1
when	1
Edward	1
did	1
not	1
come	1
near	1
us	1
for	1
three	1
days,	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
tell	1
what	1
to	1
think	1
myself;	1
and	1
I	1
believe	1
in	1
my	1
heart	1
Lucy	1
gave	1
it	1
up	1
all	1
for	1
lost;	1
for	1
we	1
came	1
away	1
from	1
your	1
brother's	1
Wednesday,	1
and	1
we	1
saw	1
nothing	1
of	1
him	1
not	1
all	1
Thursday,	1
Friday,	1
and	1
Saturday,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
was	1
become	1
of	1
him.	1
Once	1
Lucy	1
thought	1
to	1
write	1
to	1
him,	1
but	1
then	1
her	1
spirits	1
rose	1
against	1
that.	1
However	1
this	1
morning	1
he	1
came	1
just	1
as	1
we	1
came	1
home	1
from	1
church;	1
and	1
then	1
it	1
all	1
came	1
out,	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
sent	1
for	1
Wednesday	1
to	1
Harley	1
Street,	1
and	1
been	1
talked	1
to	1
by	1
his	1
mother	1
and	1
all	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
declared	1
before	1
them	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
loved	1
nobody	1
but	1
Lucy,	1
and	1
nobody	1
but	1
Lucy	1
would	1
he	1
have.	1
And	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
worried	1
by	1
what	1
passed,	1
that	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
went	1
away	1
from	1
his	1
mother's	1
house,	1
he	1
had	1
got	1
upon	1
his	1
horse,	1
and	1
rid	1
into	1
the	1
country,	1
some	1
where	1
or	1
other;	1
and	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
stayed	1
about	1
at	1
an	1
inn	1
all	1
Thursday	1
and	1
Friday,	1
on	1
purpose	1
to	1
get	1
the	1
better	1
of	1
it.	1
And	1
after	1
thinking	1
it	1
all	1
over	1
and	1
over	1
again,	1
he	1
said,	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
if,	1
now	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
fortune,	1
and	1
no	1
nothing	1
at	1
all,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
quite	1
unkind	1
to	1
keep	1
her	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
engagement,	1
because	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
for	1
her	1
loss,	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
nothing	1
but	1
two	1
thousand	1
pounds,	1
and	1
no	1
hope	1
of	1
any	1
thing	1
else;	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
orders,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
some	1
thoughts,	1
he	1
could	1
get	1
nothing	1
but	1
a	1
curacy,	1
and	1
how	1
was	1
they	1
to	1
live	1
upon	1
that?--He	1
could	1
not	1
bear	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
her	1
doing	1
no	1
better,	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
begged,	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
the	1
least	1
mind	1
for	1
it,	1
to	1
put	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
the	1
matter	1
directly,	1
and	1
leave	1
him	1
shift	1
for	1
himself.	1
I	1
heard	1
him	1
say	1
all	1
this	1
as	1
plain	1
as	1
could	1
possibly	1
be.	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
entirely	1
for	1
HER	1
sake,	1
and	1
upon	1
HER	1
account,	1
that	1
he	1
said	1
a	1
word	1
about	1
being	1
off,	1
and	1
not	1
upon	1
his	1
own.	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
my	1
oath	1
he	1
never	1
dropt	1
a	1
syllable	1
of	1
being	1
tired	1
of	1
her,	1
or	1
of	1
wishing	1
to	1
marry	1
Miss	1
Morton,	1
or	1
any	1
thing	1
like	1
it.	1
But,	1
to	1
be	1
sure,	1
Lucy	1
would	1
not	1
give	1
ear	1
to	1
such	1
kind	1
of	1
talking;	1
so	1
she	1
told	1
him	1
directly	1
(with	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
about	1
sweet	1
and	1
love,	1
you	1
know,	1
and	1
all	1
that--Oh,	1
la!	1
one	1
can't	1
repeat	1
such	1
kind	1
of	1
things	1
you	1
know)--she	1
told	1
him	1
directly,	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
least	1
mind	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
be	1
off,	1
for	1
she	1
could	1
live	1
with	1
him	1
upon	1
a	1
trifle,	1
and	1
how	1
little	1
so	1
ever	1
he	1
might	1
have,	1
she	1
should	1
be	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
have	1
it	1
all,	1
you	1
know,	1
or	1
something	1
of	1
the	1
kind.	1
So	1
then	1
he	1
was	1
monstrous	1
happy,	1
and	1
talked	1
on	1
some	1
time	1
about	1
what	1
they	1
should	1
do,	1
and	1
they	1
agreed	1
he	1
should	1
take	1
orders	1
directly,	1
and	1
they	1
must	1
wait	1
to	1
be	1
married	1
till	1
he	1
got	1
a	1
living.	1
And	1
just	1
then	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
hear	1
any	1
more,	1
for	1
my	1
cousin	1
called	1
from	1
below	1
to	1
tell	1
me	1
Mrs.	1
Richardson	1
was	1
come	1
in	1
her	1
coach,	1
and	1
would	1
take	1
one	1
of	1
us	1
to	1
Kensington	1
Gardens;	1
so	1
I	1
was	1
forced	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
interrupt	1
them,	1
to	1
ask	1
Lucy	1
if	1
she	1
would	1
like	1
to	1
go,	1
but	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
care	1
to	1
leave	1
Edward;	1
so	1
I	1
just	1
run	1
up	1
stairs	1
and	1
put	1
on	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
silk	1
stockings	1
and	1
came	1
off	1
with	1
the	1
Richardsons."	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
understand	1
what	1
you	1
mean	1
by	1
interrupting	1
them,"	1
said	1
Elinor;	1
"you	1
were	1
all	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
room	1
together,	1
were	1
not	1
you?"	1
"No,	1
indeed,	1
not	1
us.	1
La!	1
Miss	1
Dashwood,	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
people	1
make	1
love	1
when	1
any	1
body	1
else	1
is	1
by?	1
Oh,	1
for	1
shame!--To	1
be	1
sure	1
you	1
must	1
know	1
better	1
than	1
that.	1
(Laughing	1
affectedly.)--No,	1
no;	1
they	1
were	1
shut	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
drawing-room	1
together,	1
and	1
all	1
I	1
heard	1
was	1
only	1
by	1
listening	1
at	1
the	1
door."	1
"How!"	1
cried	1
Elinor;	1
"have	1
you	1
been	1
repeating	1
to	1
me	1
what	1
you	1
only	1
learnt	1
yourself	1
by	1
listening	1
at	1
the	1
door?	1
I	1
am	1
sorry	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
it	1
before;	1
for	1
I	1
certainly	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
suffered	1
you	1
to	1
give	1
me	1
particulars	1
of	1
a	1
conversation	1
which	1
you	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
known	1
yourself.	1
How	1
could	1
you	1
behave	1
so	1
unfairly	1
by	1
your	1
sister?"	1
"Oh,	1
la!	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
in	1
THAT.	1
I	1
only	1
stood	1
at	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
heard	1
what	1
I	1
could.	1
And	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
Lucy	1
would	1
have	1
done	1
just	1
the	1
same	1
by	1
me;	1
for	1
a	1
year	1
or	1
two	1
back,	1
when	1
Martha	1
Sharpe	1
and	1
I	1
had	1
so	1
many	1
secrets	1
together,	1
she	1
never	1
made	1
any	1
bones	1
of	1
hiding	1
in	1
a	1
closet,	1
or	1
behind	1
a	1
chimney-board,	1
on	1
purpose	1
to	1
hear	1
what	1
we	1
said."	1
Elinor	1
tried	1
to	1
talk	1
of	1
something	1
else;	1
but	1
Miss	1
Steele	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
kept	1
beyond	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
minutes,	1
from	1
what	1
was	1
uppermost	1
in	1
her	1
mind.	1
"Edward	1
talks	1
of	1
going	1
to	1
Oxford	1
soon,"	1
said	1
she;	1
"but	1
now	1
he	1
is	1
lodging	1
at	1
No.	1
--,	1
Pall	1
Mall.	1
What	1
an	1
ill-natured	1
woman	1
his	1
mother	1
is,	1
an't	1
she?	1
And	1
your	1
brother	1
and	1
sister	1
were	1
not	1
very	1
kind!	1
However,	1
I	1
shan't	1
say	1
anything	1
against	1
them	1
to	1
YOU;	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
sure	1
they	1
did	1
send	1
us	1
home	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
chariot,	1
which	1
was	1
more	1
than	1
I	1
looked	1
for.	1
And	1
for	1
my	1
part,	1
I	1
was	1
all	1
in	1
a	1
fright	1
for	1
fear	1
your	1
sister	1
should	1
ask	1
us	1
for	1
the	1
huswifes	1
she	1
had	1
gave	1
us	1
a	1
day	1
or	1
two	1
before;	1
but,	1
however,	1
nothing	1
was	1
said	1
about	1
them,	1
and	1
I	1
took	1
care	1
to	1
keep	1
mine	1
out	1
of	1
sight.	1
Edward	1
have	1
got	1
some	1
business	1
at	1
Oxford,	1
he	1
says;	1
so	1
he	1
must	1
go	1
there	1
for	1
a	1
time;	1
and	1
after	1
THAT,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
can	1
light	1
upon	1
a	1
Bishop,	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
ordained.	1
I	1
wonder	1
what	1
curacy	1
he	1
will	1
get!--Good	1
gracious!	1
(giggling	1
as	1
she	1
spoke)	1
I'd	1
lay	1
my	1
life	1
I	1
know	1
what	1
my	1
cousins	1
will	1
say,	1
when	1
they	1
hear	1
of	1
it.	1
They	1
will	1
tell	1
me	1
I	1
should	1
write	1
to	1
the	1
Doctor,	1
to	1
get	1
Edward	1
the	1
curacy	1
of	1
his	1
new	1
living.	1
I	1
know	1
they	1
will;	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
do	1
such	1
a	1
thing	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
world.--	1
'La!'	1
I	1
shall	1
say	1
directly,	1
'I	1
wonder	1
how	1
you	1
could	1
think	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
thing?	1
I	1
write	1
to	1
the	1
Doctor,	1
indeed!'"	1
"Well,"	1
said	1
Elinor,	1
"it	1
is	1
a	1
comfort	1
to	1
be	1
prepared	1
against	1
the	1
worst.	1
You	1
have	1
got	1
your	1
answer	1
ready."	1
Miss	1
Steele	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
reply	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
subject,	1
but	1
the	1
approach	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
party	1
made	1
another	1
more	1
necessary.	1
"Oh,	1
la!	1
here	1
come	1
the	1
Richardsons.	1
I	1
had	1
a	1
vast	1
deal	1
more	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
you,	1
but	1
I	1
must	1
not	1
stay	1
away	1
from	1
them	1
not	1
any	1
longer.	1
I	1
assure	1
you	1
they	1
are	1
very	1
genteel	1
people.	1
He	1
makes	1
a	1
monstrous	1
deal	1
of	1
money,	1
and	1
they	1
keep	1
their	1
own	1
coach.	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
time	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
about	1
it	1
myself,	1
but	1
pray	1
tell	1
her	1
I	1
am	1
quite	1
happy	1
to	1
hear	1
she	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
anger	1
against	1
us,	1
and	1
Lady	1
Middleton	1
the	1
same;	1
and	1
if	1
anything	1
should	1
happen	1
to	1
take	1
you	1
and	1
your	1
sister	1
away,	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
should	1
want	1
company,	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
we	1
should	1
be	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
stay	1
with	1
her	1
for	1
as	1
long	1
a	1
time	1
as	1
she	1
likes.	1
I	1
suppose	1
Lady	1
Middleton	1
won't	1
ask	1
us	1
any	1
more	1
this	1
bout.	1
Good-by;	1
I	1
am	1
sorry	1
Miss	1
Marianne	1
was	1
not	1
here.	1
Remember	1
me	1
kindly	1
to	1
her.	1
La!	1
if	1
you	1
have	1
not	1
got	1
your	1
spotted	1
muslin	1
on!--I	1
wonder	1
you	1
was	1
not	1
afraid	1
of	1
its	1
being	1
torn."	1
Such	1
was	1
her	1
parting	1
concern;	1
for	1
after	1
this,	1
she	1
had	1
time	1
only	1
to	1
pay	1
her	1
farewell	1
compliments	1
to	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings,	1
before	1
her	1
company	1
was	1
claimed	1
by	1
Mrs.	1
Richardson;	1
and	1
Elinor	1
was	1
left	1
in	1
possession	1
of	1
knowledge	1
which	1
might	1
feed	1
her	1
powers	1
of	1
reflection	1
some	1
time,	1
though	1
she	1
had	1
learnt	1
very	1
little	1
more	1
than	1
what	1
had	1
been	1
already	1
foreseen	1
and	1
foreplanned	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
mind.	1
Edward's	1
marriage	1
with	1
Lucy	1
was	1
as	1
firmly	1
determined	1
on,	1
and	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
its	1
taking	1
place	1
remained	1
as	1
absolutely	1
uncertain,	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
concluded	1
it	1
would	1
be;--every	1
thing	1
depended,	1
exactly	1
after	1
her	1
expectation,	1
on	1
his	1
getting	1
that	1
preferment,	1
of	1
which,	1
at	1
present,	1
there	1
seemed	1
not	1
the	1
smallest	1
chance.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
carriage,	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
was	1
eager	1
for	1
information;	1
but	1
as	1
Elinor	1
wished	1
to	1
spread	1
as	1
little	1
as	1
possible	1
intelligence	1
that	1
had	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
place	1
been	1
so	1
unfairly	1
obtained,	1
she	1
confined	1
herself	1
to	1
the	1
brief	1
repetition	1
of	1
such	1
simple	1
particulars,	1
as	1
she	1
felt	1
assured	1
that	1
Lucy,	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
consequence,	1
would	1
choose	1
to	1
have	1
known.	1
The	1
continuance	1
of	1
their	1
engagement,	1
and	1
the	1
means	1
that	1
were	1
able	1
to	1
be	1
taken	1
for	1
promoting	1
its	1
end,	1
was	1
all	1
her	1
communication;	1
and	1
this	1
produced	1
from	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
the	1
following	1
natural	1
remark.	1
"Wait	1
for	1
his	1
having	1
a	1
living!--ay,	1
we	1
all	1
know	1
how	1
THAT	1
will	1
end:--they	1
will	1
wait	1
a	1
twelvemonth,	1
and	1
finding	1
no	1
good	1
comes	1
of	1
it,	1
will	1
set	1
down	1
upon	1
a	1
curacy	1
of	1
fifty	1
pounds	1
a-year,	1
with	1
the	1
interest	1
of	1
his	1
two	1
thousand	1
pounds,	1
and	1
what	1
little	1
matter	1
Mr.	1
Steele	1
and	1
Mr.	1
Pratt	1
can	1
give	1
her.--Then	1
they	1
will	1
have	1
a	1
child	1
every	1
year!	1
and	1
Lord	1
help	1
'em!	1
how	1
poor	1
they	1
will	1
be!--I	1
must	1
see	1
what	1
I	1
can	1
give	1
them	1
towards	1
furnishing	1
their	1
house.	1
Two	1
maids	1
and	1
two	1
men,	1
indeed!--as	1
I	1
talked	1
of	1
t'other	1
day.--No,	1
no,	1
they	1
must	1
get	1
a	1
stout	1
girl	1
of	1
all	1
works.--	1
Betty's	1
sister	1
would	1
never	1
do	1
for	1
them	1
NOW."	1
The	1
next	1
morning	1
brought	1
Elinor	1
a	1
letter	1
by	1
the	1
two-penny	1
post	1
from	1
Lucy	1
herself.	1
It	1
was	1
as	1
follows:	1
"Bartlett's	1
Building,	1
March.	1
"I	1
hope	1
my	1
dear	1
Miss	1
Dashwood	1
will	1
excuse	1
the	1
liberty	1
I	1
take	1
of	1
writing	1
to	1
her;	1
but	1
I	1
know	1
your	1
friendship	1
for	1
me	1
will	1
make	1
you	1
pleased	1
to	1
hear	1
such	1
a	1
good	1
account	1
of	1
myself	1
and	1
my	1
dear	1
Edward,	1
after	1
all	1
the	1
troubles	1
we	1
have	1
went	1
through	1
lately,	1
therefore	1
will	1
make	1
no	1
more	1
apologies,	1
but	1
proceed	1
to	1
say	1
that,	1
thank	1
God!	1
though	1
we	1
have	1
suffered	1
dreadfully,	1
we	1
are	1
both	1
quite	1
well	1
now,	1
and	1
as	1
happy	1
as	1
we	1
must	1
always	1
be	1
in	1
one	1
another's	1
love.	1
We	1
have	1
had	1
great	1
trials,	1
and	1
great	1
persecutions,	1
but	1
however,	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
gratefully	1
acknowledge	1
many	1
friends,	1
yourself	1
not	1
the	1
least	1
among	1
them,	1
whose	1
great	1
kindness	1
I	1
shall	1
always	1
thankfully	1
remember,	1
as	1
will	1
Edward	1
too,	1
who	1
I	1
have	1
told	1
of	1
it.	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
glad	1
to	1
hear,	1
as	1
likewise	1
dear	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings,	1
I	1
spent	1
two	1
happy	1
hours	1
with	1
him	1
yesterday	1
afternoon,	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
hear	1
of	1
our	1
parting,	1
though	1
earnestly	1
did	1
I,	1
as	1
I	1
thought	1
my	1
duty	1
required,	1
urge	1
him	1
to	1
it	1
for	1
prudence	1
sake,	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
parted	1
for	1
ever	1
on	1
the	1
spot,	1
would	1
he	1
consent	1
to	1
it;	1
but	1
he	1
said	1
it	1
should	1
never	1
be,	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
regard	1
his	1
mother's	1
anger,	1
while	1
he	1
could	1
have	1
my	1
affections;	1
our	1
prospects	1
are	1
not	1
very	1
bright,	1
to	1
be	1
sure,	1
but	1
we	1
must	1
wait,	1
and	1
hope	1
for	1
the	1
best;	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
ordained	1
shortly;	1
and	1
should	1
it	1
ever	1
be	1
in	1
your	1
power	1
to	1
recommend	1
him	1
to	1
any	1
body	1
that	1
has	1
a	1
living	1
to	1
bestow,	1
am	1
very	1
sure	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
forget	1
us,	1
and	1
dear	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
too,	1
trust	1
she	1
will	1
speak	1
a	1
good	1
word	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
Sir	1
John,	1
or	1
Mr.	1
Palmer,	1
or	1
any	1
friend	1
that	1
may	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
assist	1
us.--Poor	1
Anne	1
was	1
much	1
to	1
blame	1
for	1
what	1
she	1
did,	1
but	1
she	1
did	1
it	1
for	1
the	1
best,	1
so	1
I	1
say	1
nothing;	1
hope	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
won't	1
think	1
it	1
too	1
much	1
trouble	1
to	1
give	1
us	1
a	1
call,	1
should	1
she	1
come	1
this	1
way	1
any	1
morning,	1
'twould	1
be	1
a	1
great	1
kindness,	1
and	1
my	1
cousins	1
would	1
be	1
proud	1
to	1
know	1
her.--My	1
paper	1
reminds	1
me	1
to	1
conclude;	1
and	1
begging	1
to	1
be	1
most	1
gratefully	1
and	1
respectfully	1
remembered	1
to	1
her,	1
and	1
to	1
Sir	1
John,	1
and	1
Lady	1
Middleton,	1
and	1
the	1
dear	1
children,	1
when	1
you	1
chance	1
to	1
see	1
them,	1
and	1
love	1
to	1
Miss	1
Marianne,	1
"I	1
am,	1
&c."	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
Elinor	1
had	1
finished	1
it,	1
she	1
performed	1
what	1
she	1
concluded	1
to	1
be	1
its	1
writer's	1
real	1
design,	1
by	1
placing	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings,	1
who	1
read	1
it	1
aloud	1
with	1
many	1
comments	1
of	1
satisfaction	1
and	1
praise.	1
"Very	1
well	1
indeed!--how	1
prettily	1
she	1
writes!--aye,	1
that	1
was	1
quite	1
proper	1
to	1
let	1
him	1
be	1
off	1
if	1
he	1
would.	1
That	1
was	1
just	1
like	1
Lucy.--Poor	1
soul!	1
I	1
wish	1
I	1
COULD	1
get	1
him	1
a	1
living,	1
with	1
all	1
my	1
heart.--She	1
calls	1
me	1
dear	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings,	1
you	1
see.	1
She	1
is	1
a	1
good-hearted	1
girl	1
as	1
ever	1
lived.--Very	1
well	1
upon	1
my	1
word.	1
That	1
sentence	1
is	1
very	1
prettily	1
turned.	1
Yes,	1
yes,	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
and	1
see	1
her,	1
sure	1
enough.	1
How	1
attentive	1
she	1
is,	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
every	1
body!--Thank	1
you,	1
my	1
dear,	1
for	1
shewing	1
it	1
me.	1
It	1
is	1
as	1
pretty	1
a	1
letter	1
as	1
ever	1
I	1
saw,	1
and	1
does	1
Lucy's	1
head	1
and	1
heart	1
great	1
credit."	1
CHAPTER	1
39	1
The	1
Miss	1
Dashwoods	1
had	1
now	1
been	1
rather	1
more	1
than	1
two	1
months	1
in	1
town,	1
and	1
Marianne's	1
impatience	1
to	1
be	1
gone	1
increased	1
every	1
day.	1
She	1
sighed	1
for	1
the	1
air,	1
the	1
liberty,	1
the	1
quiet	1
of	1
the	1
country;	1
and	1
fancied	1
that	1
if	1
any	1
place	1
could	1
give	1
her	1
ease,	1
Barton	1
must	1
do	1
it.	1
Elinor	1
was	1
hardly	1
less	1
anxious	1
than	1
herself	1
for	1
their	1
removal,	1
and	1
only	1
so	1
much	1
less	1
bent	1
on	1
its	1
being	1
effected	1
immediately,	1
as	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
conscious	1
of	1
the	1
difficulties	1
of	1
so	1
long	1
a	1
journey,	1
which	1
Marianne	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
brought	1
to	1
acknowledge.	1
She	1
began,	1
however,	1
seriously	1
to	1
turn	1
her	1
thoughts	1
towards	1
its	1
accomplishment,	1
and	1
had	1
already	1
mentioned	1
their	1
wishes	1
to	1
their	1
kind	1
hostess,	1
who	1
resisted	1
them	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
eloquence	1
of	1
her	1
good-will,	1
when	1
a	1
plan	1
was	1
suggested,	1
which,	1
though	1
detaining	1
them	1
from	1
home	1
yet	1
a	1
few	1
weeks	1
longer,	1
appeared	1
to	1
Elinor	1
altogether	1
much	1
more	1
eligible	1
than	1
any	1
other.	1
The	1
Palmers	1
were	1
to	1
remove	1
to	1
Cleveland	1
about	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
March,	1
for	1
the	1
Easter	1
holidays;	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings,	1
with	1
both	1
her	1
friends,	1
received	1
a	1
very	1
warm	1
invitation	1
from	1
Charlotte	1
to	1
go	1
with	1
them.	1
This	1
would	1
not,	1
in	1
itself,	1
have	1
been	1
sufficient	1
for	1
the	1
delicacy	1
of	1
Miss	1
Dashwood;--but	1
it	1
was	1
inforced	1
with	1
so	1
much	1
real	1
politeness	1
by	1
Mr.	1
Palmer	1
himself,	1
as,	1
joined	1
to	1
the	1
very	1
great	1
amendment	1
of	1
his	1
manners	1
towards	1
them	1
since	1
her	1
sister	1
had	1
been	1
known	1
to	1
be	1
unhappy,	1
induced	1
her	1
to	1
accept	1
it	1
with	1
pleasure.	1
When	1
she	1
told	1
Marianne	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
done,	1
however,	1
her	1
first	1
reply	1
was	1
not	1
very	1
auspicious.	1
"Cleveland!"--she	1
cried,	1
with	1
great	1
agitation.	1
"No,	1
I	1
cannot	1
go	1
to	1
Cleveland."--	1
"You	1
forget,"	1
said	1
Elinor	1
gently,	1
"that	1
its	1
situation	1
is	1
not...that	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
neighbourhood	1
of..."	1
"But	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
Somersetshire.--I	1
cannot	1
go	1
into	1
Somersetshire.--There,	1
where	1
I	1
looked	1
forward	1
to	1
going...No,	1
Elinor,	1
you	1
cannot	1
expect	1
me	1
to	1
go	1
there."	1
Elinor	1
would	1
not	1
argue	1
upon	1
the	1
propriety	1
of	1
overcoming	1
such	1
feelings;--she	1
only	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
counteract	1
them	1
by	1
working	1
on	1
others;--represented	1
it,	1
therefore,	1
as	1
a	1
measure	1
which	1
would	1
fix	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
her	1
returning	1
to	1
that	1
dear	1
mother,	1
whom	1
she	1
so	1
much	1
wished	1
to	1
see,	1
in	1
a	1
more	1
eligible,	1
more	1
comfortable	1
manner,	1
than	1
any	1
other	1
plan	1
could	1
do,	1
and	1
perhaps	1
without	1
any	1
greater	1
delay.	1
From	1
Cleveland,	1
which	1
was	1
within	1
a	1
few	1
miles	1
of	1
Bristol,	1
the	1
distance	1
to	1
Barton	1
was	1
not	1
beyond	1
one	1
day,	1
though	1
a	1
long	1
day's	1
journey;	1
and	1
their	1
mother's	1
servant	1
might	1
easily	1
come	1
there	1
to	1
attend	1
them	1
down;	1
and	1
as	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
no	1
occasion	1
of	1
their	1
staying	1
above	1
a	1
week	1
at	1
Cleveland,	1
they	1
might	1
now	1
be	1
at	1
home	1
in	1
little	1
more	1
than	1
three	1
weeks'	1
time.	1
As	1
Marianne's	1
affection	1
for	1
her	1
mother	1
was	1
sincere,	1
it	1
must	1
triumph	1
with	1
little	1
difficulty,	1
over	1
the	1
imaginary	1
evils	1
she	1
had	1
started.	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
was	1
so	1
far	1
from	1
being	1
weary	1
of	1
her	1
guest,	1
that	1
she	1
pressed	1
them	1
very	1
earnestly	1
to	1
return	1
with	1
her	1
again	1
from	1
Cleveland.	1
Elinor	1
was	1
grateful	1
for	1
the	1
attention,	1
but	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
alter	1
her	1
design;	1
and	1
their	1
mother's	1
concurrence	1
being	1
readily	1
gained,	1
every	1
thing	1
relative	1
to	1
their	1
return	1
was	1
arranged	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
it	1
could	1
be;--	1
and	1
Marianne	1
found	1
some	1
relief	1
in	1
drawing	1
up	1
a	1
statement	1
of	1
the	1
hours	1
that	1
were	1
yet	1
to	1
divide	1
her	1
from	1
Barton.	1
"Ah!	1
Colonel,	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
you	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
do	1
without	1
the	1
Miss	1
Dashwoods;"--was	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings's	1
address	1
to	1
him	1
when	1
he	1
first	1
called	1
on	1
her,	1
after	1
their	1
leaving	1
her	1
was	1
settled--"for	1
they	1
are	1
quite	1
resolved	1
upon	1
going	1
home	1
from	1
the	1
Palmers;--and	1
how	1
forlorn	1
we	1
shall	1
be,	1
when	1
I	1
come	1
back!--Lord!	1
we	1
shall	1
sit	1
and	1
gape	1
at	1
one	1
another	1
as	1
dull	1
as	1
two	1
cats."	1
Perhaps	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
was	1
in	1
hopes,	1
by	1
this	1
vigorous	1
sketch	1
of	1
their	1
future	1
ennui,	1
to	1
provoke	1
him	1
to	1
make	1
that	1
offer,	1
which	1
might	1
give	1
himself	1
an	1
escape	1
from	1
it;--	1
and	1
if	1
so,	1
she	1
had	1
soon	1
afterwards	1
good	1
reason	1
to	1
think	1
her	1
object	1
gained;	1
for,	1
on	1
Elinor's	1
moving	1
to	1
the	1
window	1
to	1
take	1
more	1
expeditiously	1
the	1
dimensions	1
of	1
a	1
print,	1
which	1
she	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
copy	1
for	1
her	1
friend,	1
he	1
followed	1
her	1
to	1
it	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
particular	1
meaning,	1
and	1
conversed	1
with	1
her	1
there	1
for	1
several	1
minutes.	1
The	1
effect	1
of	1
his	1
discourse	1
on	1
the	1
lady	1
too,	1
could	1
not	1
escape	1
her	1
observation,	1
for	1
though	1
she	1
was	1
too	1
honorable	1
to	1
listen,	1
and	1
had	1
even	1
changed	1
her	1
seat,	1
on	1
purpose	1
that	1
she	1
might	1
NOT	1
hear,	1
to	1
one	1
close	1
by	1
the	1
piano	1
forte	1
on	1
which	1
Marianne	1
was	1
playing,	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
keep	1
herself	1
from	1
seeing	1
that	1
Elinor	1
changed	1
colour,	1
attended	1
with	1
agitation,	1
and	1
was	1
too	1
intent	1
on	1
what	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
pursue	1
her	1
employment.--	1
Still	1
farther	1
in	1
confirmation	1
of	1
her	1
hopes,	1
in	1
the	1
interval	1
of	1
Marianne's	1
turning	1
from	1
one	1
lesson	1
to	1
another,	1
some	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
Colonel's	1
inevitably	1
reached	1
her	1
ear,	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
apologising	1
for	1
the	1
badness	1
of	1
his	1
house.	1
This	1
set	1
the	1
matter	1
beyond	1
a	1
doubt.	1
She	1
wondered,	1
indeed,	1
at	1
his	1
thinking	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
do	1
so;	1
but	1
supposed	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
proper	1
etiquette.	1
What	1
Elinor	1
said	1
in	1
reply	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
distinguish,	1
but	1
judged	1
from	1
the	1
motion	1
of	1
her	1
lips,	1
that	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
THAT	1
any	1
material	1
objection;--and	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
commended	1
her	1
in	1
her	1
heart	1
for	1
being	1
so	1
honest.	1
They	1
then	1
talked	1
on	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
longer	1
without	1
her	1
catching	1
a	1
syllable,	1
when	1
another	1
lucky	1
stop	1
in	1
Marianne's	1
performance	1
brought	1
her	1
these	1
words	1
in	1
the	1
Colonel's	1
calm	1
voice,--	1
"I	1
am	1
afraid	1
it	1
cannot	1
take	1
place	1
very	1
soon."	1
Astonished	1
and	1
shocked	1
at	1
so	1
unlover-like	1
a	1
speech,	1
she	1
was	1
almost	1
ready	1
to	1
cry	1
out,	1
"Lord!	1
what	1
should	1
hinder	1
it?"--but	1
checking	1
her	1
desire,	1
confined	1
herself	1
to	1
this	1
silent	1
ejaculation.	1
"This	1
is	1
very	1
strange!--sure	1
he	1
need	1
not	1
wait	1
to	1
be	1
older."	1
This	1
delay	1
on	1
the	1
Colonel's	1
side,	1
however,	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
offend	1
or	1
mortify	1
his	1
fair	1
companion	1
in	1
the	1
least,	1
for	1
on	1
their	1
breaking	1
up	1
the	1
conference	1
soon	1
afterwards,	1
and	1
moving	1
different	1
ways,	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
very	1
plainly	1
heard	1
Elinor	1
say,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
voice	1
which	1
shewed	1
her	1
to	1
feel	1
what	1
she	1
said,	1
"I	1
shall	1
always	1
think	1
myself	1
very	1
much	1
obliged	1
to	1
you."	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
was	1
delighted	1
with	1
her	1
gratitude,	1
and	1
only	1
wondered	1
that	1
after	1
hearing	1
such	1
a	1
sentence,	1
the	1
Colonel	1
should	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
take	1
leave	1
of	1
them,	1
as	1
he	1
immediately	1
did,	1
with	1
the	1
utmost	1
sang-froid,	1
and	1
go	1
away	1
without	1
making	1
her	1
any	1
reply!--She	1
had	1
not	1
thought	1
her	1
old	1
friend	1
could	1
have	1
made	1
so	1
indifferent	1
a	1
suitor.	1
What	1
had	1
really	1
passed	1
between	1
them	1
was	1
to	1
this	1
effect.	1
"I	1
have	1
heard,"	1
said	1
he,	1
with	1
great	1
compassion,	1
"of	1
the	1
injustice	1
your	1
friend	1
Mr.	1
Ferrars	1
has	1
suffered	1
from	1
his	1
family;	1
for	1
if	1
I	1
understand	1
the	1
matter	1
right,	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
entirely	1
cast	1
off	1
by	1
them	1
for	1
persevering	1
in	1
his	1
engagement	1
with	1
a	1
very	1
deserving	1
young	1
woman.--	1
Have	1
I	1
been	1
rightly	1
informed?--Is	1
it	1
so?--"	1
Elinor	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
it	1
was.	1
"The	1
cruelty,	1
the	1
impolitic	1
cruelty,"--he	1
replied,	1
with	1
great	1
feeling,--"of	1
dividing,	1
or	1
attempting	1
to	1
divide,	1
two	1
young	1
people	1
long	1
attached	1
to	1
each	1
other,	1
is	1
terrible.--	1
Mrs.	1
Ferrars	1
does	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
she	1
may	1
be	1
doing--what	1
she	1
may	1
drive	1
her	1
son	1
to.	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
Mr.	1
Ferrars	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
times	1
in	1
Harley	1
Street,	1
and	1
am	1
much	1
pleased	1
with	1
him.	1
He	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
with	1
whom	1
one	1
can	1
be	1
intimately	1
acquainted	1
in	1
a	1
short	1
time,	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
enough	1
of	1
him	1
to	1
wish	1
him	1
well	1
for	1
his	1
own	1
sake,	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
friend	1
of	1
yours,	1
I	1
wish	1
it	1
still	1
more.	1
I	1
understand	1
that	1
he	1
intends	1
to	1
take	1
orders.	1
Will	1
you	1
be	1
so	1
good	1
as	1
to	1
tell	1
him	1
that	1
the	1
living	1
of	1
Delaford,	1
now	1
just	1
vacant,	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
informed	1
by	1
this	1
day's	1
post,	1
is	1
his,	1
if	1
he	1
think	1
it	1
worth	1
his	1
acceptance--but	1
THAT,	1
perhaps,	1
so	1
unfortunately	1
circumstanced	1
as	1
he	1
is	1
now,	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
nonsense	1
to	1
appear	1
to	1
doubt;	1
I	1
only	1
wish	1
it	1
were	1
more	1
valuable.--	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
rectory,	1
but	1
a	1
small	1
one;	1
the	1
late	1
incumbent,	1
I	1
believe,	1
did	1
not	1
make	1
more	1
than	1
200	1
L	1
per	1
annum,	1
and	1
though	1
it	1
is	1
certainly	1
capable	1
of	1
improvement,	1
I	1
fear,	1
not	1
to	1
such	1
an	1
amount	1
as	1
to	1
afford	1
him	1
a	1
very	1
comfortable	1
income.	1
Such	1
as	1
it	1
is,	1
however,	1
my	1
pleasure	1
in	1
presenting	1
him	1
to	1
it,	1
will	1
be	1
very	1
great.	1
Pray	1
assure	1
him	1
of	1
it."	1
Elinor's	1
astonishment	1
at	1
this	1
commission	1
could	1
hardly	1
have	1
been	1
greater,	1
had	1
the	1
Colonel	1
been	1
really	1
making	1
her	1
an	1
offer	1
of	1
his	1
hand.	1
The	1
preferment,	1
which	1
only	1
two	1
days	1
before	1
she	1
had	1
considered	1
as	1
hopeless	1
for	1
Edward,	1
was	1
already	1
provided	1
to	1
enable	1
him	1
to	1
marry;--	1
and	1
SHE,	1
of	1
all	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
was	1
fixed	1
on	1
to	1
bestow	1
it!--Her	1
emotion	1
was	1
such	1
as	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
had	1
attributed	1
to	1
a	1
very	1
different	1
cause;--but	1
whatever	1
minor	1
feelings	1
less	1
pure,	1
less	1
pleasing,	1
might	1
have	1
a	1
share	1
in	1
that	1
emotion,	1
her	1
esteem	1
for	1
the	1
general	1
benevolence,	1
and	1
her	1
gratitude	1
for	1
the	1
particular	1
friendship,	1
which	1
together	1
prompted	1
Colonel	1
Brandon	1
to	1
this	1
act,	1
were	1
strongly	1
felt,	1
and	1
warmly	1
expressed.	1
She	1
thanked	1
him	1
for	1
it	1
with	1
all	1
her	1
heart,	1
spoke	1
of	1
Edward's	1
principles	1
and	1
disposition	1
with	1
that	1
praise	1
which	1
she	1
knew	1
them	1
to	1
deserve;	1
and	1
promised	1
to	1
undertake	1
the	1
commission	1
with	1
pleasure,	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
really	1
his	1
wish	1
to	1
put	1
off	1
so	1
agreeable	1
an	1
office	1
to	1
another.	1
But	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
thinking	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
could	1
so	1
well	1
perform	1
it	1
as	1
himself.	1
It	1
was	1
an	1
office	1
in	1
short,	1
from	1
which,	1
unwilling	1
to	1
give	1
Edward	1
the	1
pain	1
of	1
receiving	1
an	1
obligation	1
from	1
HER,	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
be	1
spared	1
herself;--	1
but	1
Colonel	1
Brandon,	1
on	1
motives	1
of	1
equal	1
delicacy,	1
declining	1
it	1
likewise,	1
still	1
seemed	1
so	1
desirous	1
of	1
its	1
being	1
given	1
through	1
her	1
means,	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
on	1
any	1
account	1
make	1
farther	1
opposition.	1
Edward,	1
she	1
believed,	1
was	1
still	1
in	1
town,	1
and	1
fortunately	1
she	1
had	1
heard	1
his	1
address	1
from	1
Miss	1
Steele.	1
She	1
could	1
undertake	1
therefore	1
to	1
inform	1
him	1
of	1
it,	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
the	1
day.	1
After	1
this	1
had	1
been	1
settled,	1
Colonel	1
Brandon	1
began	1
to	1
talk	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
advantage	1
in	1
securing	1
so	1
respectable	1
and	1
agreeable	1
a	1
neighbour,	1
and	1
THEN	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
he	1
mentioned	1
with	1
regret,	1
that	1
the	1
house	1
was	1
small	1
and	1
indifferent;--an	1
evil	1
which	1
Elinor,	1
as	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
had	1
supposed	1
her	1
to	1
do,	1
made	1
very	1
light	1
of,	1
at	1
least	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
regarded	1
its	1
size.	1
"The	1
smallness	1
of	1
the	1
house,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"I	1
cannot	1
imagine	1
any	1
inconvenience	1
to	1
them,	1
for	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
in	1
proportion	1
to	1
their	1
family	1
and	1
income."	1
By	1
which	1
the	1
Colonel	1
was	1
surprised	1
to	1
find	1
that	1
SHE	1
was	1
considering	1
Mr.	1
Ferrars's	1
marriage	1
as	1
the	1
certain	1
consequence	1
of	1
the	1
presentation;	1
for	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
suppose	1
it	1
possible	1
that	1
Delaford	1
living	1
could	1
supply	1
such	1
an	1
income,	1
as	1
anybody	1
in	1
his	1
style	1
of	1
life	1
would	1
venture	1
to	1
settle	1
on--	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
so.	1
"This	1
little	1
rectory	1
CAN	1
do	1
no	1
more	1
than	1
make	1
Mr.	1
Ferrars	1
comfortable	1
as	1
a	1
bachelor;	1
it	1
cannot	1
enable	1
him	1
to	1
marry.	1
I	1
am	1
sorry	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
my	1
patronage	1
ends	1
with	1
this;	1
and	1
my	1
interest	1
is	1
hardly	1
more	1
extensive.	1
If,	1
however,	1
by	1
an	1
unforeseen	1
chance	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
in	1
my	1
power	1
to	1
serve	1
him	1
farther,	1
I	1
must	1
think	1
very	1
differently	1
of	1
him	1
from	1
what	1
I	1
now	1
do,	1
if	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
as	1
ready	1
to	1
be	1
useful	1
to	1
him	1
then	1
as	1
I	1
sincerely	1
wish	1
I	1
could	1
be	1
at	1
present.	1
What	1
I	1
am	1
now	1
doing	1
indeed,	1
seems	1
nothing	1
at	1
all,	1
since	1
it	1
can	1
advance	1
him	1
so	1
little	1
towards	1
what	1
must	1
be	1
his	1
principal,	1
his	1
only	1
object	1
of	1
happiness.	1
His	1
marriage	1
must	1
still	1
be	1
a	1
distant	1
good;--at	1
least,	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
it	1
cannot	1
take	1
place	1
very	1
soon.--"	1
Such	1
was	1
the	1
sentence	1
which,	1
when	1
misunderstood,	1
so	1
justly	1
offended	1
the	1
delicate	1
feelings	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings;	1
but	1
after	1
this	1
narration	1
of	1
what	1
really	1
passed	1
between	1
Colonel	1
Brandon	1
and	1
Elinor,	1
while	1
they	1
stood	1
at	1
the	1
window,	1
the	1
gratitude	1
expressed	1
by	1
the	1
latter	1
on	1
their	1
parting,	1
may	1
perhaps	1
appear	1
in	1
general,	1
not	1
less	1
reasonably	1
excited,	1
nor	1
less	1
properly	1
worded	1
than	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
arisen	1
from	1
an	1
offer	1
of	1
marriage.	1
CHAPTER	1
40	1
"Well,	1
Miss	1
Dashwood,"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings,	1
sagaciously	1
smiling,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
gentleman	1
had	1
withdrawn,	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
ask	1
you	1
what	1
the	1
Colonel	1
has	1
been	1
saying	1
to	1
you;	1
for	1
though,	1
upon	1
my	1
honour,	1
I	1
TRIED	1
to	1
keep	1
out	1
of	1
hearing,	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
catching	1
enough	1
to	1
understand	1
his	1
business.	1
And	1
I	1
assure	1
you	1
I	1
never	1
was	1
better	1
pleased	1
in	1
my	1
life,	1
and	1
I	1
wish	1
you	1
joy	1
of	1
it	1
with	1
all	1
my	1
heart."	1
"Thank	1
you,	1
ma'am,"	1
said	1
Elinor.	1
"It	1
is	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
great	1
joy	1
to	1
me;	1
and	1
I	1
feel	1
the	1
goodness	1
of	1
Colonel	1
Brandon	1
most	1
sensibly.	1
There	1
are	1
not	1
many	1
men	1
who	1
would	1
act	1
as	1
he	1
has	1
done.	1
Few	1
people	1
who	1
have	1
so	1
compassionate	1
a	1
heart!	1
I	1
never	1
was	1
more	1
astonished	1
in	1
my	1
life."	1
"Lord!	1
my	1
dear,	1
you	1
are	1
very	1
modest.	1
I	1
an't	1
the	1
least	1
astonished	1
at	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
often	1
thought	1
of	1
late,	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
more	1
likely	1
to	1
happen."	1
"You	1
judged	1
from	1
your	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
Colonel's	1
general	1
benevolence;	1
but	1
at	1
least	1
you	1
could	1
not	1
foresee	1
that	1
the	1
opportunity	1
would	1
so	1
very	1
soon	1
occur."	1
"Opportunity!"	1
repeated	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings--"Oh!	1
as	1
to	1
that,	1
when	1
a	1
man	1
has	1
once	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
thing,	1
somehow	1
or	1
other	1
he	1
will	1
soon	1
find	1
an	1
opportunity.	1
Well,	1
my	1
dear,	1
I	1
wish	1
you	1
joy	1
of	1
it	1
again	1
and	1
again;	1
and	1
if	1
ever	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
happy	1
couple	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
I	1
think	1
I	1
shall	1
soon	1
know	1
where	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
them."	1
"You	1
mean	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
Delaford	1
after	1
them	1
I	1
suppose,"	1
said	1
Elinor,	1
with	1
a	1
faint	1
smile.	1
"Aye,	1
my	1
dear,	1
that	1
I	1
do,	1
indeed.	1
And	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
being	1
a	1
bad	1
one,	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
the	1
Colonel	1
would	1
be	1
at,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
as	1
good	1
a	1
one	1
as	1
ever	1
I	1
saw."	1
"He	1
spoke	1
of	1
its	1
being	1
out	1
of	1
repair."	1
"Well,	1
and	1
whose	1
fault	1
is	1
that?	1
why	1
don't	1
he	1
repair	1
it?--	1
who	1
should	1
do	1
it	1
but	1
himself?"	1
They	1
were	1
interrupted	1
by	1
the	1
servant's	1
coming	1
in	1
to	1
announce	1
the	1
carriage	1
being	1
at	1
the	1
door;	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
immediately	1
preparing	1
to	1
go,	1
said,--	1
"Well,	1
my	1
dear,	1
I	1
must	1
be	1
gone	1
before	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
half	1
my	1
talk	1
out.	1
But,	1
however,	1
we	1
may	1
have	1
it	1
all	1
over	1
in	1
the	1
evening;	1
for	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
quite	1
alone.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
ask	1
you	1
to	1
go	1
with	1
me,	1
for	1
I	1
dare	1
say	1
your	1
mind	1
is	1
too	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
matter	1
to	1
care	1
for	1
company;	1
and	1
besides,	1
you	1
must	1
long	1
to	1
tell	1
your	1
sister	1
all	1
about	1
it."	1
Marianne	1
had	1
left	1
the	1
room	1
before	1
the	1
conversation	1
began.	1
"Certainly,	1
ma'am,	1
I	1
shall	1
tell	1
Marianne	1
of	1
it;	1
but	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
mention	1
it	1
at	1
present	1
to	1
any	1
body	1
else."	1
"Oh!	1
very	1
well,"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
rather	1
disappointed.	1
"Then	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
me	1
tell	1
it	1
to	1
Lucy,	1
for	1
I	1
think	1
of	1
going	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
Holborn	1
to-day."	1
"No,	1
ma'am,	1
not	1
even	1
Lucy	1
if	1
you	1
please.	1
One	1
day's	1
delay	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
very	1
material;	1
and	1
till	1
I	1
have	1
written	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Ferrars,	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
mentioned	1
to	1
any	1
body	1
else.	1
I	1
shall	1
do	1
THAT	1
directly.	1
It	1
is	1
of	1
importance	1
that	1
no	1
time	1
should	1
be	1
lost	1
with	1
him,	1
for	1
he	1
will	1
of	1
course	1
have	1
much	1
to	1
do	1
relative	1
to	1
his	1
ordination."	1
This	1
speech	1
at	1
first	1
puzzled	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
exceedingly.	1
Why	1
Mr.	1
Ferrars	1
was	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
written	1
to	1
about	1
it	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
hurry,	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
immediately	1
comprehend.	1
A	1
few	1
moments'	1
reflection,	1
however,	1
produced	1
a	1
very	1
happy	1
idea,	1
and	1
she	1
exclaimed;--	1
"Oh,	1
ho!--I	1
understand	1
you.	1
Mr.	1
Ferrars	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
man.	1
Well,	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
better	1
for	1
him.	1
Ay,	1
to	1
be	1
sure,	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
ordained	1
in	1
readiness;	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
find	1
things	1
are	1
so	1
forward	1
between	1
you.	1
But,	1
my	1
dear,	1
is	1
not	1
this	1
rather	1
out	1
of	1
character?	1
Should	1
not	1
the	1
Colonel	1
write	1
himself?--sure,	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
proper	1
person."	1
Elinor	1
did	1
not	1
quite	1
understand	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings's	1
speech,	1
neither	1
did	1
she	1
think	1
it	1
worth	1
inquiring	1
into;	1
and	1
therefore	1
only	1
replied	1
to	1
its	1
conclusion.	1
"Colonel	1
Brandon	1
is	1
so	1
delicate	1
a	1
man,	1
that	1
he	1
rather	1
wished	1
any	1
one	1
to	1
announce	1
his	1
intentions	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Ferrars	1
than	1
himself."	1
"And	1
so	1
YOU	1
are	1
forced	1
to	1
do	1
it.	1
Well	1
THAT	1
is	1
an	1
odd	1
kind	1
of	1
delicacy!	1
However,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
disturb	1
you	1
(seeing	1
her	1
preparing	1
to	1
write.)	1
You	1
know	1
your	1
own	1
concerns	1
best.	1
So	1
goodby,	1
my	1
dear.	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
heard	1
of	1
any	1
thing	1
to	1
please	1
me	1
so	1
well	1
since	1
Charlotte	1
was	1
brought	1
to	1
bed."	1
And	1
away	1
she	1
went;	1
but	1
returning	1
again	1
in	1
a	1
moment,	1
"I	1
have	1
just	1
been	1
thinking	1
of	1
Betty's	1
sister,	1
my	1
dear.	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
get	1
her	1
so	1
good	1
a	1
mistress.	1
But	1
whether	1
she	1
would	1
do	1
for	1
a	1
lady's	1
maid,	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
I	1
can't	1
tell.	1
She	1
is	1
an	1
excellent	1
housemaid,	1
and	1
works	1
very	1
well	1
at	1
her	1
needle.	1
However,	1
you	1
will	1
think	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
at	1
your	1
leisure."	1
"Certainly,	1
ma'am,"	1
replied	1
Elinor,	1
not	1
hearing	1
much	1
of	1
what	1
she	1
said,	1
and	1
more	1
anxious	1
to	1
be	1
alone,	1
than	1
to	1
be	1
mistress	1
of	1
the	1
subject.	1
How	1
she	1
should	1
begin--how	1
she	1
should	1
express	1
herself	1
in	1
her	1
note	1
to	1
Edward,	1
was	1
now	1
all	1
her	1
concern.	1
The	1
particular	1
circumstances	1
between	1
them	1
made	1
a	1
difficulty	1
of	1
that	1
which	1
to	1
any	1
other	1
person	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
easiest	1
thing	1
in	1
the	1
world;	1
but	1
she	1
equally	1
feared	1
to	1
say	1
too	1
much	1
or	1
too	1
little,	1
and	1
sat	1
deliberating	1
over	1
her	1
paper,	1
with	1
the	1
pen	1
in	1
her	1
band,	1
till	1
broken	1
in	1
on	1
by	1
the	1
entrance	1
of	1
Edward	1
himself.	1
He	1
had	1
met	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
in	1
her	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
carriage,	1
as	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
leave	1
his	1
farewell	1
card;	1
and	1
she,	1
after	1
apologising	1
for	1
not	1
returning	1
herself,	1
had	1
obliged	1
him	1
to	1
enter,	1
by	1
saying	1
that	1
Miss	1
Dashwood	1
was	1
above,	1
and	1
wanted	1
to	1
speak	1
with	1
him	1
on	1
very	1
particular	1
business.	1
Elinor	1
had	1
just	1
been	1
congratulating	1
herself,	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
her	1
perplexity,	1
that	1
however	1
difficult	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
to	1
express	1
herself	1
properly	1
by	1
letter,	1
it	1
was	1
at	1
least	1
preferable	1
to	1
giving	1
the	1
information	1
by	1
word	1
of	1
mouth,	1
when	1
her	1
visitor	1
entered,	1
to	1
force	1
her	1
upon	1
this	1
greatest	1
exertion	1
of	1
all.	1
Her	1
astonishment	1
and	1
confusion	1
were	1
very	1
great	1
on	1
his	1
so	1
sudden	1
appearance.	1
She	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
him	1
before	1
since	1
his	1
engagement	1
became	1
public,	1
and	1
therefore	1
not	1
since	1
his	1
knowing	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
acquainted	1
with	1
it;	1
which,	1
with	1
the	1
consciousness	1
of	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
thinking	1
of,	1
and	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
to	1
tell	1
him,	1
made	1
her	1
feel	1
particularly	1
uncomfortable	1
for	1
some	1
minutes.	1
He	1
too	1
was	1
much	1
distressed;	1
and	1
they	1
sat	1
down	1
together	1
in	1
a	1
most	1
promising	1
state	1
of	1
embarrassment.--Whether	1
he	1
had	1
asked	1
her	1
pardon	1
for	1
his	1
intrusion	1
on	1
first	1
coming	1
into	1
the	1
room,	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
recollect;	1
but	1
determining	1
to	1
be	1
on	1
the	1
safe	1
side,	1
he	1
made	1
his	1
apology	1
in	1
form	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
say	1
any	1
thing,	1
after	1
taking	1
a	1
chair.	1
"Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
told	1
me,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"that	1
you	1
wished	1
to	1
speak	1
with	1
me,	1
at	1
least	1
I	1
understood	1
her	1
so--or	1
I	1
certainly	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
intruded	1
on	1
you	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
manner;	1
though	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
extremely	1
sorry	1
to	1
leave	1
London	1
without	1
seeing	1
you	1
and	1
your	1
sister;	1
especially	1
as	1
it	1
will	1
most	1
likely	1
be	1
some	1
time--it	1
is	1
not	1
probable	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
soon	1
have	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
meeting	1
you	1
again.	1
I	1
go	1
to	1
Oxford	1
tomorrow."	1
"You	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
gone,	1
however,"	1
said	1
Elinor,	1
recovering	1
herself,	1
and	1
determined	1
to	1
get	1
over	1
what	1
she	1
so	1
much	1
dreaded	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
possible,	1
"without	1
receiving	1
our	1
good	1
wishes,	1
even	1
if	1
we	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
give	1
them	1
in	1
person.	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
was	1
quite	1
right	1
in	1
what	1
she	1
said.	1
I	1
have	1
something	1
of	1
consequence	1
to	1
inform	1
you	1
of,	1
which	1
I	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
communicating	1
by	1
paper.	1
I	1
am	1
charged	1
with	1
a	1
most	1
agreeable	1
office	1
(breathing	1
rather	1
faster	1
than	1
usual	1
as	1
she	1
spoke.)	1
Colonel	1
Brandon,	1
who	1
was	1
here	1
only	1
ten	1
minutes	1
ago,	1
has	1
desired	1
me	1
to	1
say,	1
that	1
understanding	1
you	1
mean	1
to	1
take	1
orders,	1
he	1
has	1
great	1
pleasure	1
in	1
offering	1
you	1
the	1
living	1
of	1
Delaford	1
now	1
just	1
vacant,	1
and	1
only	1
wishes	1
it	1
were	1
more	1
valuable.	1
Allow	1
me	1
to	1
congratulate	1
you	1
on	1
having	1
so	1
respectable	1
and	1
well-judging	1
a	1
friend,	1
and	1
to	1
join	1
in	1
his	1
wish	1
that	1
the	1
living--it	1
is	1
about	1
two	1
hundred	1
a-year--were	1
much	1
more	1
considerable,	1
and	1
such	1
as	1
might	1
better	1
enable	1
you	1
to--as	1
might	1
be	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
temporary	1
accommodation	1
to	1
yourself--such,	1
in	1
short,	1
as	1
might	1
establish	1
all	1
your	1
views	1
of	1
happiness."	1
What	1
Edward	1
felt,	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
say	1
it	1
himself,	1
it	1
cannot	1
be	1
expected	1
that	1
any	1
one	1
else	1
should	1
say	1
for	1
him.	1
He	1
LOOKED	1
all	1
the	1
astonishment	1
which	1
such	1
unexpected,	1
such	1
unthought-of	1
information	1
could	1
not	1
fail	1
of	1
exciting;	1
but	1
he	1
said	1
only	1
these	1
two	1
words,	1
"Colonel	1
Brandon!"	1
"Yes,"	1
continued	1
Elinor,	1
gathering	1
more	1
resolution,	1
as	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
worst	1
was	1
over,	1
"Colonel	1
Brandon	1
means	1
it	1
as	1
a	1
testimony	1
of	1
his	1
concern	1
for	1
what	1
has	1
lately	1
passed--for	1
the	1
cruel	1
situation	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
unjustifiable	1
conduct	1
of	1
your	1
family	1
has	1
placed	1
you--a	1
concern	1
which	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
Marianne,	1
myself,	1
and	1
all	1
your	1
friends,	1
must	1
share;	1
and	1
likewise	1
as	1
a	1
proof	1
of	1
his	1
high	1
esteem	1
for	1
your	1
general	1
character,	1
and	1
his	1
particular	1
approbation	1
of	1
your	1
behaviour	1
on	1
the	1
present	1
occasion."	1
"Colonel	1
Brandon	1
give	1
ME	1
a	1
living!--Can	1
it	1
be	1
possible?"	1
"The	1
unkindness	1
of	1
your	1
own	1
relations	1
has	1
made	1
you	1
astonished	1
to	1
find	1
friendship	1
any	1
where."	1
"No,"	1
replied	1
be,	1
with	1
sudden	1
consciousness,	1
"not	1
to	1
find	1
it	1
in	1
YOU;	1
for	1
I	1
cannot	1
be	1
ignorant	1
that	1
to	1
you,	1
to	1
your	1
goodness,	1
I	1
owe	1
it	1
all.--I	1
feel	1
it--I	1
would	1
express	1
it	1
if	1
I	1
could--but,	1
as	1
you	1
well	1
know,	1
I	1
am	1
no	1
orator."	1
"You	1
are	1
very	1
much	1
mistaken.	1
I	1
do	1
assure	1
you	1
that	1
you	1
owe	1
it	1
entirely,	1
at	1
least	1
almost	1
entirely,	1
to	1
your	1
own	1
merit,	1
and	1
Colonel	1
Brandon's	1
discernment	1
of	1
it.	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
no	1
hand	1
in	1
it.	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
know,	1
till	1
I	1
understood	1
his	1
design,	1
that	1
the	1
living	1
was	1
vacant;	1
nor	1
had	1
it	1
ever	1
occurred	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
had	1
such	1
a	1
living	1
in	1
his	1
gift.	1
As	1
a	1
friend	1
of	1
mine,	1
of	1
my	1
family,	1
he	1
may,	1
perhaps--indeed	1
I	1
know	1
he	1
HAS,	1
still	1
greater	1
pleasure	1
in	1
bestowing	1
it;	1
but,	1
upon	1
my	1
word,	1
you	1
owe	1
nothing	1
to	1
my	1
solicitation."	1
Truth	1
obliged	1
her	1
to	1
acknowledge	1
some	1
small	1
share	1
in	1
the	1
action,	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
so	1
unwilling	1
to	1
appear	1
as	1
the	1
benefactress	1
of	1
Edward,	1
that	1
she	1
acknowledged	1
it	1
with	1
hesitation;	1
which	1
probably	1
contributed	1
to	1
fix	1
that	1
suspicion	1
in	1
his	1
mind	1
which	1
had	1
recently	1
entered	1
it.	1
For	1
a	1
short	1
time	1
he	1
sat	1
deep	1
in	1
thought,	1
after	1
Elinor	1
had	1
ceased	1
to	1
speak;--at	1
last,	1
and	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
rather	1
an	1
effort,	1
he	1
said,	1
"Colonel	1
Brandon	1
seems	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
great	1
worth	1
and	1
respectability.	1
I	1
have	1
always	1
heard	1
him	1
spoken	1
of	1
as	1
such,	1
and	1
your	1
brother	1
I	1
know	1
esteems	1
him	1
highly.	1
He	1
is	1
undoubtedly	1
a	1
sensible	1
man,	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
manners	1
perfectly	1
the	1
gentleman."	1
"Indeed,"	1
replied	1
Elinor,	1
"I	1
believe	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
find	1
him,	1
on	1
farther	1
acquaintance,	1
all	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
heard	1
him	1
to	1
be,	1
and	1
as	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
such	1
very	1
near	1
neighbours	1
(for	1
I	1
understand	1
the	1
parsonage	1
is	1
almost	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
mansion-house,)	1
it	1
is	1
particularly	1
important	1
that	1
he	1
SHOULD	1
be	1
all	1
this."	1
Edward	1
made	1
no	1
answer;	1
but	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
turned	1
away	1
her	1
head,	1
gave	1
her	1
a	1
look	1
so	1
serious,	1
so	1
earnest,	1
so	1
uncheerful,	1
as	1
seemed	1
to	1
say,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
hereafter	1
wish	1
the	1
distance	1
between	1
the	1
parsonage	1
and	1
the	1
mansion-house	1
much	1
greater.	1
"Colonel	1
Brandon,	1
I	1
think,	1
lodges	1
in	1
St.	1
James	1
Street,"	1
said	1
he,	1
soon	1
afterwards,	1
rising	1
from	1
his	1
chair.	1
Elinor	1
told	1
him	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
house.	1
"I	1
must	1
hurry	1
away	1
then,	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
those	1
thanks	1
which	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
allow	1
me	1
to	1
give	1
YOU;	1
to	1
assure	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
made	1
me	1
a	1
very--an	1
exceedingly	1
happy	1
man."	1
Elinor	1
did	1
not	1
offer	1
to	1
detain	1
him;	1
and	1
they	1
parted,	1
with	1
a	1
very	1
earnest	1
assurance	1
on	1
HER	1
side	1
of	1
her	1
unceasing	1
good	1
wishes	1
for	1
his	1
happiness	1
in	1
every	1
change	1
of	1
situation	1
that	1
might	1
befall	1
him;	1
on	1
HIS,	1
with	1
rather	1
an	1
attempt	1
to	1
return	1
the	1
same	1
good	1
will,	1
than	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
expressing	1
it.	1
"When	1
I	1
see	1
him	1
again,"	1
said	1
Elinor	1
to	1
herself,	1
as	1
the	1
door	1
shut	1
him	1
out,	1
"I	1
shall	1
see	1
him	1
the	1
husband	1
of	1
Lucy."	1
And	1
with	1
this	1
pleasing	1
anticipation,	1
she	1
sat	1
down	1
to	1
reconsider	1
the	1
past,	1
recall	1
the	1
words	1
and	1
endeavour	1
to	1
comprehend	1
all	1
the	1
feelings	1
of	1
Edward;	1
and,	1
of	1
course,	1
to	1
reflect	1
on	1
her	1
own	1
with	1
discontent.	1
When	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
came	1
home,	1
though	1
she	1
returned	1
from	1
seeing	1
people	1
whom	1
she	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
before,	1
and	1
of	1
whom	1
therefore	1
she	1
must	1
have	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
to	1
say,	1
her	1
mind	1
was	1
so	1
much	1
more	1
occupied	1
by	1
the	1
important	1
secret	1
in	1
her	1
possession,	1
than	1
by	1
anything	1
else,	1
that	1
she	1
reverted	1
to	1
it	1
again	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
Elinor	1
appeared.	1
"Well,	1
my	1
dear,"	1
she	1
cried,	1
"I	1
sent	1
you	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
young	1
man.	1
Did	1
not	1
I	1
do	1
right?--And	1
I	1
suppose	1
you	1
had	1
no	1
great	1
difficulty--You	1
did	1
not	1
find	1
him	1
very	1
unwilling	1
to	1
accept	1
your	1
proposal?"	1
"No,	1
ma'am;	1
THAT	1
was	1
not	1
very	1
likely."	1
"Well,	1
and	1
how	1
soon	1
will	1
he	1
be	1
ready?--For	1
it	1
seems	1
all	1
to	1
depend	1
upon	1
that."	1
"Really,"	1
said	1
Elinor,	1
"I	1
know	1
so	1
little	1
of	1
these	1
kind	1
of	1
forms,	1
that	1
I	1
can	1
hardly	1
even	1
conjecture	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
time,	1
or	1
the	1
preparation	1
necessary;	1
but	1
I	1
suppose	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
months	1
will	1
complete	1
his	1
ordination."	1
"Two	1
or	1
three	1
months!"	1
cried	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings;	1
"Lord!	1
my	1
dear,	1
how	1
calmly	1
you	1
talk	1
of	1
it;	1
and	1
can	1
the	1
Colonel	1
wait	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
months!	1
Lord	1
bless	1
me!--I	1
am	1
sure	1
it	1
would	1
put	1
ME	1
quite	1
out	1
of	1
patience!--And	1
though	1
one	1
would	1
be	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
do	1
a	1
kindness	1
by	1
poor	1
Mr.	1
Ferrars,	1
I	1
do	1
think	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
worth	1
while	1
to	1
wait	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
months	1
for	1
him.	1
Sure	1
somebody	1
else	1
might	1
be	1
found	1
that	1
would	1
do	1
as	1
well;	1
somebody	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
orders	1
already."	1
"My	1
dear	1
ma'am,"	1
said	1
Elinor,	1
"what	1
can	1
you	1
be	1
thinking	1
of?--	1
Why,	1
Colonel	1
Brandon's	1
only	1
object	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
use	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Ferrars."	1
"Lord	1
bless	1
you,	1
my	1
dear!--Sure	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
mean	1
to	1
persuade	1
me	1
that	1
the	1
Colonel	1
only	1
marries	1
you	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
giving	1
ten	1
guineas	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Ferrars!"	1
The	1
deception	1
could	1
not	1
continue	1
after	1
this;	1
and	1
an	1
explanation	1
immediately	1
took	1
place,	1
by	1
which	1
both	1
gained	1
considerable	1
amusement	1
for	1
the	1
moment,	1
without	1
any	1
material	1
loss	1
of	1
happiness	1
to	1
either,	1
for	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
only	1
exchanged	1
one	1
form	1
of	1
delight	1
for	1
another,	1
and	1
still	1
without	1
forfeiting	1
her	1
expectation	1
of	1
the	1
first.	1
"Aye,	1
aye,	1
the	1
parsonage	1
is	1
but	1
a	1
small	1
one,"	1
said	1
she,	1
after	1
the	1
first	1
ebullition	1
of	1
surprise	1
and	1
satisfaction	1
was	1
over,	1
"and	1
very	1
likely	1
MAY	1
be	1
out	1
of	1
repair;	1
but	1
to	1
hear	1
a	1
man	1
apologising,	1
as	1
I	1
thought,	1
for	1
a	1
house	1
that	1
to	1
my	1
knowledge	1
has	1
five	1
sitting	1
rooms	1
on	1
the	1
ground-floor,	1
and	1
I	1
think	1
the	1
housekeeper	1
told	1
me	1
could	1
make	1
up	1
fifteen	1
beds!--	1
and	1
to	1
you	1
too,	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
used	1
to	1
live	1
in	1
Barton	1
cottage!--	1
It	1
seems	1
quite	1
ridiculous.	1
But,	1
my	1
dear,	1
we	1
must	1
touch	1
up	1
the	1
Colonel	1
to	1
do	1
some	1
thing	1
to	1
the	1
parsonage,	1
and	1
make	1
it	1
comfortable	1
for	1
them,	1
before	1
Lucy	1
goes	1
to	1
it."	1
"But	1
Colonel	1
Brandon	1
does	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
have	1
any	1
idea	1
of	1
the	1
living's	1
being	1
enough	1
to	1
allow	1
them	1
to	1
marry."	1
"The	1
Colonel	1
is	1
a	1
ninny,	1
my	1
dear;	1
because	1
he	1
has	1
two	1
thousand	1
a-year	1
himself,	1
he	1
thinks	1
that	1
nobody	1
else	1
can	1
marry	1
on	1
less.	1
Take	1
my	1
word	1
for	1
it,	1
that,	1
if	1
I	1
am	1
alive,	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
paying	1
a	1
visit	1
at	1
Delaford	1
Parsonage	1
before	1
Michaelmas;	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
I	1
sha'nt	1
go	1
if	1
Lucy	1
an't	1
there."	1
Elinor	1
was	1
quite	1
of	1
her	1
opinion,	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
probability	1
of	1
their	1
not	1
waiting	1
for	1
any	1
thing	1
more.	1
CHAPTER	1
41	1
Edward,	1
having	1
carried	1
his	1
thanks	1
to	1
Colonel	1
Brandon,	1
proceeded	1
with	1
his	1
happiness	1
to	1
Lucy;	1
and	1
such	1
was	1
the	1
excess	1
of	1
it	1
by	1
the	1
time	1
he	1
reached	1
Bartlett's	1
Buildings,	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
assure	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings,	1
who	1
called	1
on	1
her	1
again	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
with	1
her	1
congratulations,	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
him	1
in	1
such	1
spirits	1
before	1
in	1
her	1
life.	1
Her	1
own	1
happiness,	1
and	1
her	1
own	1
spirits,	1
were	1
at	1
least	1
very	1
certain;	1
and	1
she	1
joined	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
most	1
heartily	1
in	1
her	1
expectation	1
of	1
their	1
being	1
all	1
comfortably	1
together	1
in	1
Delaford	1
Parsonage	1
before	1
Michaelmas.	1
So	1
far	1
was	1
she,	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
from	1
any	1
backwardness	1
to	1
give	1
Elinor	1
that	1
credit	1
which	1
Edward	1
WOULD	1
give	1
her,	1
that	1
she	1
spoke	1
of	1
her	1
friendship	1
for	1
them	1
both	1
with	1
the	1
most	1
grateful	1
warmth,	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
own	1
all	1
their	1
obligation	1
to	1
her,	1
and	1
openly	1
declared	1
that	1
no	1
exertion	1
for	1
their	1
good	1
on	1
Miss	1
Dashwood's	1
part,	1
either	1
present	1
or	1
future,	1
would	1
ever	1
surprise	1
her,	1
for	1
she	1
believed	1
her	1
capable	1
of	1
doing	1
any	1
thing	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
for	1
those	1
she	1
really	1
valued.	1
As	1
for	1
Colonel	1
Brandon,	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
only	1
ready	1
to	1
worship	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
saint,	1
but	1
was	1
moreover	1
truly	1
anxious	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
treated	1
as	1
one	1
in	1
all	1
worldly	1
concerns;	1
anxious	1
that	1
his	1
tithes	1
should	1
be	1
raised	1
to	1
the	1
utmost;	1
and	1
scarcely	1
resolved	1
to	1
avail	1
herself,	1
at	1
Delaford,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
she	1
possibly	1
could,	1
of	1
his	1
servants,	1
his	1
carriage,	1
his	1
cows,	1
and	1
his	1
poultry.	1
It	1
was	1
now	1
above	1
a	1
week	1
since	1
John	1
Dashwood	1
had	1
called	1
in	1
Berkeley	1
Street,	1
and	1
as	1
since	1
that	1
time	1
no	1
notice	1
had	1
been	1
taken	1
by	1
them	1
of	1
his	1
wife's	1
indisposition,	1
beyond	1
one	1
verbal	1
enquiry,	1
Elinor	1
began	1
to	1
feel	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
pay	1
her	1
a	1
visit.--This	1
was	1
an	1
obligation,	1
however,	1
which	1
not	1
only	1
opposed	1
her	1
own	1
inclination,	1
but	1
which	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
assistance	1
of	1
any	1
encouragement	1
from	1
her	1
companions.	1
Marianne,	1
not	1
contented	1
with	1
absolutely	1
refusing	1
to	1
go	1
herself,	1
was	1
very	1
urgent	1
to	1
prevent	1
her	1
sister's	1
going	1
at	1
all;	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings,	1
though	1
her	1
carriage	1
was	1
always	1
at	1
Elinor's	1
service,	1
so	1
very	1
much	1
disliked	1
Mrs.	1
John	1
Dashwood,	1
that	1
not	1
even	1
her	1
curiosity	1
to	1
see	1
how	1
she	1
looked	1
after	1
the	1
late	1
discovery,	1
nor	1
her	1
strong	1
desire	1
to	1
affront	1
her	1
by	1
taking	1
Edward's	1
part,	1
could	1
overcome	1
her	1
unwillingness	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
her	1
company	1
again.	1
The	1
consequence	1
was,	1
that	1
Elinor	1
set	1
out	1
by	1
herself	1
to	1
pay	1
a	1
visit,	1
for	1
which	1
no	1
one	1
could	1
really	1
have	1
less	1
inclination,	1
and	1
to	1
run	1
the	1
risk	1
of	1
a	1
tete-a-tete	1
with	1
a	1
woman,	1
whom	1
neither	1
of	1
the	1
others	1
had	1
so	1
much	1
reason	1
to	1
dislike.	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood	1
was	1
denied;	1
but	1
before	1
the	1
carriage	1
could	1
turn	1
from	1
the	1
house,	1
her	1
husband	1
accidentally	1
came	1
out.	1
He	1
expressed	1
great	1
pleasure	1
in	1
meeting	1
Elinor,	1
told	1
her	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
just	1
going	1
to	1
call	1
in	1
Berkeley	1
Street,	1
and,	1
assuring	1
her	1
that	1
Fanny	1
would	1
be	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
her,	1
invited	1
her	1
to	1
come	1
in.	1
They	1
walked	1
up	1
stairs	1
in	1
to	1
the	1
drawing-room.--Nobody	1
was	1
there.	1
"Fanny	1
is	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
room,	1
I	1
suppose,"	1
said	1
he:--"I	1
will	1
go	1
to	1
her	1
presently,	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
she	1
will	1
not	1
have	1
the	1
least	1
objection	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
seeing	1
YOU.--	1
Very	1
far	1
from	1
it,	1
indeed.	1
NOW	1
especially	1
there	1
cannot	1
be--but	1
however,	1
you	1
and	1
Marianne	1
were	1
always	1
great	1
favourites.--Why	1
would	1
not	1
Marianne	1
come?"--	1
Elinor	1
made	1
what	1
excuse	1
she	1
could	1
for	1
her.	1
"I	1
am	1
not	1
sorry	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
alone,"	1
he	1
replied,	1
"for	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
you.	1
This	1
living	1
of	1
Colonel	1
Brandon's--can	1
it	1
be	1
true?--has	1
he	1
really	1
given	1
it	1
to	1
Edward?--I	1
heard	1
it	1
yesterday	1
by	1
chance,	1
and	1
was	1
coming	1
to	1
you	1
on	1
purpose	1
to	1
enquire	1
farther	1
about	1
it."	1
"It	1
is	1
perfectly	1
true.--Colonel	1
Brandon	1
has	1
given	1
the	1
living	1
of	1
Delaford	1
to	1
Edward."	1
"Really!--Well,	1
this	1
is	1
very	1
astonishing!--no	1
relationship!--no	1
connection	1
between	1
them!--and	1
now	1
that	1
livings	1
fetch	1
such	1
a	1
price!--what	1
was	1
the	1
value	1
of	1
this?"	1
"About	1
two	1
hundred	1
a	1
year."	1
"Very	1
well--and	1
for	1
the	1
next	1
presentation	1
to	1
a	1
living	1
of	1
that	1
value--supposing	1
the	1
late	1
incumbent	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
old	1
and	1
sickly,	1
and	1
likely	1
to	1
vacate	1
it	1
soon--he	1
might	1
have	1
got	1
I	1
dare	1
say--fourteen	1
hundred	1
pounds.	1
And	1
how	1
came	1
he	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
settled	1
that	1
matter	1
before	1
this	1
person's	1
death?--NOW	1
indeed	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
too	1
late	1
to	1
sell	1
it,	1
but	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
Colonel	1
Brandon's	1
sense!--I	1
wonder	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
so	1
improvident	1
in	1
a	1
point	1
of	1
such	1
common,	1
such	1
natural,	1
concern!--Well,	1
I	1
am	1
convinced	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
vast	1
deal	1
of	1
inconsistency	1
in	1
almost	1
every	1
human	1
character.	1
I	1
suppose,	1
however--on	1
recollection--that	1
the	1
case	1
may	1
probably	1
be	1
THIS.	1
Edward	1
is	1
only	1
to	1
hold	1
the	1
living	1
till	1
the	1
person	1
to	1
whom	1
the	1
Colonel	1
has	1
really	1
sold	1
the	1
presentation,	1
is	1
old	1
enough	1
to	1
take	1
it.--Aye,	1
aye,	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
fact,	1
depend	1
upon	1
it."	1
Elinor	1
contradicted	1
it,	1
however,	1
very	1
positively;	1
and	1
by	1
relating	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
herself	1
been	1
employed	1
in	1
conveying	1
the	1
offer	1
from	1
Colonel	1
Brandon	1
to	1
Edward,	1
and,	1
therefore,	1
must	1
understand	1
the	1
terms	1
on	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
given,	1
obliged	1
him	1
to	1
submit	1
to	1
her	1
authority.	1
"It	1
is	1
truly	1
astonishing!"--he	1
cried,	1
after	1
hearing	1
what	1
she	1
said--"what	1
could	1
be	1
the	1
Colonel's	1
motive?"	1
"A	1
very	1
simple	1
one--to	1
be	1
of	1
use	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Ferrars."	1
"Well,	1
well;	1
whatever	1
Colonel	1
Brandon	1
may	1
be,	1
Edward	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
lucky	1
man.--You	1
will	1
not	1
mention	1
the	1
matter	1
to	1
Fanny,	1
however,	1
for	1
though	1
I	1
have	1
broke	1
it	1
to	1
her,	1
and	1
she	1
bears	1
it	1
vastly	1
well,--she	1
will	1
not	1
like	1
to	1
hear	1
it	1
much	1
talked	1
of."	1
Elinor	1
had	1
some	1
difficulty	1
here	1
to	1
refrain	1
from	1
observing,	1
that	1
she	1
thought	1
Fanny	1
might	1
have	1
borne	1
with	1
composure,	1
an	1
acquisition	1
of	1
wealth	1
to	1
her	1
brother,	1
by	1
which	1
neither	1
she	1
nor	1
her	1
child	1
could	1
be	1
possibly	1
impoverished.	1
"Mrs.	1
Ferrars,"	1
added	1
he,	1
lowering	1
his	1
voice	1
to	1
the	1
tone	1
becoming	1
so	1
important	1
a	1
subject,	1
"knows	1
nothing	1
about	1
it	1
at	1
present,	1
and	1
I	1
believe	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
best	1
to	1
keep	1
it	1
entirely	1
concealed	1
from	1
her	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
may	1
be.--	1
When	1
the	1
marriage	1
takes	1
place,	1
I	1
fear	1
she	1
must	1
hear	1
of	1
it	1
all."	1
"But	1
why	1
should	1
such	1
precaution	1
be	1
used?--Though	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
supposed	1
that	1
Mrs.	1
Ferrars	1
can	1
have	1
the	1
smallest	1
satisfaction	1
in	1
knowing	1
that	1
her	1
son	1
has	1
money	1
enough	1
to	1
live	1
upon,--for	1
THAT	1
must	1
be	1
quite	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
question;	1
yet	1
why,	1
upon	1
her	1
late	1
behaviour,	1
is	1
she	1
supposed	1
to	1
feel	1
at	1
all?--She	1
has	1
done	1
with	1
her	1
son,	1
she	1
cast	1
him	1
off	1
for	1
ever,	1
and	1
has	1
made	1
all	1
those	1
over	1
whom	1
she	1
had	1
any	1
influence,	1
cast	1
him	1
off	1
likewise.	1
Surely,	1
after	1
doing	1
so,	1
she	1
cannot	1
be	1
imagined	1
liable	1
to	1
any	1
impression	1
of	1
sorrow	1
or	1
of	1
joy	1
on	1
his	1
account--	1
she	1
cannot	1
be	1
interested	1
in	1
any	1
thing	1
that	1
befalls	1
him.--	1
She	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
so	1
weak	1
as	1
to	1
throw	1
away	1
the	1
comfort	1
of	1
a	1
child,	1
and	1
yet	1
retain	1
the	1
anxiety	1
of	1
a	1
parent!"	1
"Ah!	1
Elinor,"	1
said	1
John,	1
"your	1
reasoning	1
is	1
very	1
good,	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
founded	1
on	1
ignorance	1
of	1
human	1
nature.	1
When	1
Edward's	1
unhappy	1
match	1
takes	1
place,	1
depend	1
upon	1
it	1
his	1
mother	1
will	1
feel	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
never	1
discarded	1
him;	1
and,	1
therefore	1
every	1
circumstance	1
that	1
may	1
accelerate	1
that	1
dreadful	1
event,	1
must	1
be	1
concealed	1
from	1
her	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
possible.	1
Mrs.	1
Ferrars	1
can	1
never	1
forget	1
that	1
Edward	1
is	1
her	1
son."	1
"You	1
surprise	1
me;	1
I	1
should	1
think	1
it	1
must	1
nearly	1
have	1
escaped	1
her	1
memory	1
by	1
THIS	1
time."	1
"You	1
wrong	1
her	1
exceedingly.	1
Mrs.	1
Ferrars	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
affectionate	1
mothers	1
in	1
the	1
world."	1
Elinor	1
was	1
silent.	1
"We	1
think	1
NOW,"--said	1
Mr.	1
Dashwood,	1
after	1
a	1
short	1
pause,	1
"of	1
ROBERT'S	1
marrying	1
Miss	1
Morton."	1
Elinor,	1
smiling	1
at	1
the	1
grave	1
and	1
decisive	1
importance	1
of	1
her	1
brother's	1
tone,	1
calmly	1
replied,	1
"The	1
lady,	1
I	1
suppose,	1
has	1
no	1
choice	1
in	1
the	1
affair."	1
"Choice!--how	1
do	1
you	1
mean?"	1
"I	1
only	1
mean	1
that	1
I	1
suppose,	1
from	1
your	1
manner	1
of	1
speaking,	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
the	1
same	1
to	1
Miss	1
Morton	1
whether	1
she	1
marry	1
Edward	1
or	1
Robert."	1
"Certainly,	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
difference;	1
for	1
Robert	1
will	1
now	1
to	1
all	1
intents	1
and	1
purposes	1
be	1
considered	1
as	1
the	1
eldest	1
son;--and	1
as	1
to	1
any	1
thing	1
else,	1
they	1
are	1
both	1
very	1
agreeable	1
young	1
men:	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
that	1
one	1
is	1
superior	1
to	1
the	1
other."	1
Elinor	1
said	1
no	1
more,	1
and	1
John	1
was	1
also	1
for	1
a	1
short	1
time	1
silent.--His	1
reflections	1
ended	1
thus.	1
"Of	1
ONE	1
thing,	1
my	1
dear	1
sister,"	1
kindly	1
taking	1
her	1
hand,	1
and	1
speaking	1
in	1
an	1
awful	1
whisper,--"I	1
may	1
assure	1
you;--	1
and	1
I	1
WILL	1
do	1
it,	1
because	1
I	1
know	1
it	1
must	1
gratify	1
you.	1
I	1
have	1
good	1
reason	1
to	1
think--indeed	1
I	1
have	1
it	1
from	1
the	1
best	1
authority,	1
or	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
repeat	1
it,	1
for	1
otherwise	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
very	1
wrong	1
to	1
say	1
any	1
thing	1
about	1
it--but	1
I	1
have	1
it	1
from	1
the	1
very	1
best	1
authority--not	1
that	1
I	1
ever	1
precisely	1
heard	1
Mrs.	1
Ferrars	1
say	1
it	1
herself--but	1
her	1
daughter	1
DID,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
it	1
from	1
her--That	1
in	1
short,	1
whatever	1
objections	1
there	1
might	1
be	1
against	1
a	1
certain--a	1
certain	1
connection--you	1
understand	1
me--it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
far	1
preferable	1
to	1
her,	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
given	1
her	1
half	1
the	1
vexation	1
that	1
THIS	1
does.	1
I	1
was	1
exceedingly	1
pleased	1
to	1
hear	1
that	1
Mrs.	1
Ferrars	1
considered	1
it	1
in	1
that	1
light--	1
a	1
very	1
gratifying	1
circumstance	1
you	1
know	1
to	1
us	1
all.	1
'It	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
beyond	1
comparison,'	1
she	1
said,	1
'the	1
least	1
evil	1
of	1
the	1
two,	1
and	1
she	1
would	1
be	1
glad	1
to	1
compound	1
NOW	1
for	1
nothing	1
worse.'	1
But	1
however,	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
quite	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
question--not	1
to	1
be	1
thought	1
of	1
or	1
mentioned--	1
as	1
to	1
any	1
attachment	1
you	1
know--it	1
never	1
could	1
be--all	1
that	1
is	1
gone	1
by.	1
But	1
I	1
thought	1
I	1
would	1
just	1
tell	1
you	1
of	1
this,	1
because	1
I	1
knew	1
how	1
much	1
it	1
must	1
please	1
you.	1
Not	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
any	1
reason	1
to	1
regret,	1
my	1
dear	1
Elinor.	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
doubt	1
of	1
your	1
doing	1
exceedingly	1
well--quite	1
as	1
well,	1
or	1
better,	1
perhaps,	1
all	1
things	1
considered.	1
Has	1
Colonel	1
Brandon	1
been	1
with	1
you	1
lately?"	1
Elinor	1
had	1
heard	1
enough,	1
if	1
not	1
to	1
gratify	1
her	1
vanity,	1
and	1
raise	1
her	1
self-importance,	1
to	1
agitate	1
her	1
nerves	1
and	1
fill	1
her	1
mind;--and	1
she	1
was	1
therefore	1
glad	1
to	1
be	1
spared	1
from	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
saying	1
much	1
in	1
reply	1
herself,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
danger	1
of	1
hearing	1
any	1
thing	1
more	1
from	1
her	1
brother,	1
by	1
the	1
entrance	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Robert	1
Ferrars.	1
After	1
a	1
few	1
moments'	1
chat,	1
John	1
Dashwood,	1
recollecting	1
that	1
Fanny	1
was	1
yet	1
uninformed	1
of	1
her	1
sister's	1
being	1
there,	1
quitted	1
the	1
room	1
in	1
quest	1
of	1
her;	1
and	1
Elinor	1
was	1
left	1
to	1
improve	1
her	1
acquaintance	1
with	1
Robert,	1
who,	1
by	1
the	1
gay	1
unconcern,	1
the	1
happy	1
self-complacency	1
of	1
his	1
manner	1
while	1
enjoying	1
so	1
unfair	1
a	1
division	1
of	1
his	1
mother's	1
love	1
and	1
liberality,	1
to	1
the	1
prejudice	1
of	1
his	1
banished	1
brother,	1
earned	1
only	1
by	1
his	1
own	1
dissipated	1
course	1
of	1
life,	1
and	1
that	1
brother's	1
integrity,	1
was	1
confirming	1
her	1
most	1
unfavourable	1
opinion	1
of	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
heart.	1
They	1
had	1
scarcely	1
been	1
two	1
minutes	1
by	1
themselves,	1
before	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
Edward;	1
for	1
he,	1
too,	1
had	1
heard	1
of	1
the	1
living,	1
and	1
was	1
very	1
inquisitive	1
on	1
the	1
subject.	1
Elinor	1
repeated	1
the	1
particulars	1
of	1
it,	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
given	1
them	1
to	1
John;	1
and	1
their	1
effect	1
on	1
Robert,	1
though	1
very	1
different,	1
was	1
not	1
less	1
striking	1
than	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
on	1
HIM.	1
He	1
laughed	1
most	1
immoderately.	1
The	1
idea	1
of	1
Edward's	1
being	1
a	1
clergyman,	1
and	1
living	1
in	1
a	1
small	1
parsonage-house,	1
diverted	1
him	1
beyond	1
measure;--and	1
when	1
to	1
that	1
was	1
added	1
the	1
fanciful	1
imagery	1
of	1
Edward	1
reading	1
prayers	1
in	1
a	1
white	1
surplice,	1
and	1
publishing	1
the	1
banns	1
of	1
marriage	1
between	1
John	1
Smith	1
and	1
Mary	1
Brown,	1
he	1
could	1
conceive	1
nothing	1
more	1
ridiculous.	1
Elinor,	1
while	1
she	1
waited	1
in	1
silence	1
and	1
immovable	1
gravity,	1
the	1
conclusion	1
of	1
such	1
folly,	1
could	1
not	1
restrain	1
her	1
eyes	1
from	1
being	1
fixed	1
on	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
that	1
spoke	1
all	1
the	1
contempt	1
it	1
excited.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
look,	1
however,	1
very	1
well	1
bestowed,	1
for	1
it	1
relieved	1
her	1
own	1
feelings,	1
and	1
gave	1
no	1
intelligence	1
to	1
him.	1
He	1
was	1
recalled	1
from	1
wit	1
to	1
wisdom,	1
not	1
by	1
any	1
reproof	1
of	1
her's,	1
but	1
by	1
his	1
own	1
sensibility.	1
"We	1
may	1
treat	1
it	1
as	1
a	1
joke,"	1
said	1
he,	1
at	1
last,	1
recovering	1
from	1
the	1
affected	1
laugh	1
which	1
had	1
considerably	1
lengthened	1
out	1
the	1
genuine	1
gaiety	1
of	1
the	1
moment--"but,	1
upon	1
my	1
soul,	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
most	1
serious	1
business.	1
Poor	1
Edward!	1
he	1
is	1
ruined	1
for	1
ever.	1
I	1
am	1
extremely	1
sorry	1
for	1
it--	1
for	1
I	1
know	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
very	1
good-hearted	1
creature;	1
as	1
well-meaning	1
a	1
fellow	1
perhaps,	1
as	1
any	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
You	1
must	1
not	1
judge	1
of	1
him,	1
Miss	1
Dashwood,	1
from	1
YOUR	1
slight	1
acquaintance.--Poor	1
Edward!--His	1
manners	1
are	1
certainly	1
not	1
the	1
happiest	1
in	1
nature.--But	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
all	1
born,	1
you	1
know,	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
powers,--the	1
same	1
address.--	1
Poor	1
fellow!--to	1
see	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
circle	1
of	1
strangers!--	1
to	1
be	1
sure	1
it	1
was	1
pitiable	1
enough!--but	1
upon	1
my	1
soul,	1
I	1
believe	1
he	1
has	1
as	1
good	1
a	1
heart	1
as	1
any	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom;	1
and	1
I	1
declare	1
and	1
protest	1
to	1
you	1
I	1
never	1
was	1
so	1
shocked	1
in	1
my	1
life,	1
as	1
when	1
it	1
all	1
burst	1
forth.	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
believe	1
it.--	1
My	1
mother	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
person	1
who	1
told	1
me	1
of	1
it;	1
and	1
I,	1
feeling	1
myself	1
called	1
on	1
to	1
act	1
with	1
resolution,	1
immediately	1
said	1
to	1
her,	1
'My	1
dear	1
madam,	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
you	1
may	1
intend	1
to	1
do	1
on	1
the	1
occasion,	1
but	1
as	1
for	1
myself,	1
I	1
must	1
say,	1
that	1
if	1
Edward	1
does	1
marry	1
this	1
young	1
woman,	1
I	1
never	1
will	1
see	1
him	1
again.'	1
That	1
was	1
what	1
I	1
said	1
immediately.--	1
I	1
was	1
most	1
uncommonly	1
shocked,	1
indeed!--Poor	1
Edward!--he	1
has	1
done	1
for	1
himself	1
completely--shut	1
himself	1
out	1
for	1
ever	1
from	1
all	1
decent	1
society!--but,	1
as	1
I	1
directly	1
said	1
to	1
my	1
mother,	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
surprised	1
at	1
it;	1
from	1
his	1
style	1
of	1
education,	1
it	1
was	1
always	1
to	1
be	1
expected.	1
My	1
poor	1
mother	1
was	1
half	1
frantic."	1
"Have	1
you	1
ever	1
seen	1
the	1
lady?"	1
"Yes;	1
once,	1
while	1
she	1
was	1
staying	1
in	1
this	1
house,	1
I	1
happened	1
to	1
drop	1
in	1
for	1
ten	1
minutes;	1
and	1
I	1
saw	1
quite	1
enough	1
of	1
her.	1
The	1
merest	1
awkward	1
country	1
girl,	1
without	1
style,	1
or	1
elegance,	1
and	1
almost	1
without	1
beauty.--	1
I	1
remember	1
her	1
perfectly.	1
Just	1
the	1
kind	1
of	1
girl	1
I	1
should	1
suppose	1
likely	1
to	1
captivate	1
poor	1
Edward.	1
I	1
offered	1
immediately,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
my	1
mother	1
related	1
the	1
affair	1
to	1
me,	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
him	1
myself,	1
and	1
dissuade	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
match;	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
too	1
late	1
THEN,	1
I	1
found,	1
to	1
do	1
any	1
thing,	1
for	1
unluckily,	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
at	1
first,	1
and	1
knew	1
nothing	1
of	1
it	1
till	1
after	1
the	1
breach	1
had	1
taken	1
place,	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
for	1
me,	1
you	1
know,	1
to	1
interfere.	1
But	1
had	1
I	1
been	1
informed	1
of	1
it	1
a	1
few	1
hours	1
earlier--I	1
think	1
it	1
is	1
most	1
probable--that	1
something	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
hit	1
on.	1
I	1
certainly	1
should	1
have	1
represented	1
it	1
to	1
Edward	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
strong	1
light.	1
'My	1
dear	1
fellow,'	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
said,	1
'consider	1
what	1
you	1
are	1
doing.	1
You	1
are	1
making	1
a	1
most	1
disgraceful	1
connection,	1
and	1
such	1
a	1
one	1
as	1
your	1
family	1
are	1
unanimous	1
in	1
disapproving.'	1
I	1
cannot	1
help	1
thinking,	1
in	1
short,	1
that	1
means	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
found.	1
But	1
now	1
it	1
is	1
all	1
too	1
late.	1
He	1
must	1
be	1
starved,	1
you	1
know;--	1
that	1
is	1
certain;	1
absolutely	1
starved."	1
He	1
had	1
just	1
settled	1
this	1
point	1
with	1
great	1
composure,	1
when	1
the	1
entrance	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
John	1
Dashwood	1
put	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
the	1
subject.	1
But	1
though	1
SHE	1
never	1
spoke	1
of	1
it	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
family,	1
Elinor	1
could	1
see	1
its	1
influence	1
on	1
her	1
mind,	1
in	1
the	1
something	1
like	1
confusion	1
of	1
countenance	1
with	1
which	1
she	1
entered,	1
and	1
an	1
attempt	1
at	1
cordiality	1
in	1
her	1
behaviour	1
to	1
herself.	1
She	1
even	1
proceeded	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
concerned	1
to	1
find	1
that	1
Elinor	1
and	1
her	1
sister	1
were	1
so	1
soon	1
to	1
leave	1
town,	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
hoped	1
to	1
see	1
more	1
of	1
them;--an	1
exertion	1
in	1
which	1
her	1
husband,	1
who	1
attended	1
her	1
into	1
the	1
room,	1
and	1
hung	1
enamoured	1
over	1
her	1
accents,	1
seemed	1
to	1
distinguish	1
every	1
thing	1
that	1
was	1
most	1
affectionate	1
and	1
graceful.	1
CHAPTER	1
42	1
One	1
other	1
short	1
call	1
in	1
Harley	1
Street,	1
in	1
which	1
Elinor	1
received	1
her	1
brother's	1
congratulations	1
on	1
their	1
travelling	1
so	1
far	1
towards	1
Barton	1
without	1
any	1
expense,	1
and	1
on	1
Colonel	1
Brandon's	1
being	1
to	1
follow	1
them	1
to	1
Cleveland	1
in	1
a	1
day	1
or	1
two,	1
completed	1
the	1
intercourse	1
of	1
the	1
brother	1
and	1
sisters	1
in	1
town;--and	1
a	1
faint	1
invitation	1
from	1
Fanny,	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
Norland	1
whenever	1
it	1
should	1
happen	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
their	1
way,	1
which	1
of	1
all	1
things	1
was	1
the	1
most	1
unlikely	1
to	1
occur,	1
with	1
a	1
more	1
warm,	1
though	1
less	1
public,	1
assurance,	1
from	1
John	1
to	1
Elinor,	1
of	1
the	1
promptitude	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
should	1
come	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
at	1
Delaford,	1
was	1
all	1
that	1
foretold	1
any	1
meeting	1
in	1
the	1
country.	1
It	1
amused	1
her	1
to	1
observe	1
that	1
all	1
her	1
friends	1
seemed	1
determined	1
to	1
send	1
her	1
to	1
Delaford;--a	1
place,	1
in	1
which,	1
of	1
all	1
others,	1
she	1
would	1
now	1
least	1
chuse	1
to	1
visit,	1
or	1
wish	1
to	1
reside;	1
for	1
not	1
only	1
was	1
it	1
considered	1
as	1
her	1
future	1
home	1
by	1
her	1
brother	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings,	1
but	1
even	1
Lucy,	1
when	1
they	1
parted,	1
gave	1
her	1
a	1
pressing	1
invitation	1
to	1
visit	1
her	1
there.	1
Very	1
early	1
in	1
April,	1
and	1
tolerably	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
day,	1
the	1
two	1
parties	1
from	1
Hanover	1
Square	1
and	1
Berkeley	1
Street	1
set	1
out	1
from	1
their	1
respective	1
homes,	1
to	1
meet,	1
by	1
appointment,	1
on	1
the	1
road.	1
For	1
the	1
convenience	1
of	1
Charlotte	1
and	1
her	1
child,	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
more	1
than	1
two	1
days	1
on	1
their	1
journey,	1
and	1
Mr.	1
Palmer,	1
travelling	1
more	1
expeditiously	1
with	1
Colonel	1
Brandon,	1
was	1
to	1
join	1
them	1
at	1
Cleveland	1
soon	1
after	1
their	1
arrival.	1
Marianne,	1
few	1
as	1
had	1
been	1
her	1
hours	1
of	1
comfort	1
in	1
London,	1
and	1
eager	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
long	1
been	1
to	1
quit	1
it,	1
could	1
not,	1
when	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
point,	1
bid	1
adieu	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
for	1
the	1
last	1
time	1
enjoyed	1
those	1
hopes,	1
and	1
that	1
confidence,	1
in	1
Willoughby,	1
which	1
were	1
now	1
extinguished	1
for	1
ever,	1
without	1
great	1
pain.	1
Nor	1
could	1
she	1
leave	1
the	1
place	1
in	1
which	1
Willoughby	1
remained,	1
busy	1
in	1
new	1
engagements,	1
and	1
new	1
schemes,	1
in	1
which	1
SHE	1
could	1
have	1
no	1
share,	1
without	1
shedding	1
many	1
tears.	1
Elinor's	1
satisfaction,	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
of	1
removal,	1
was	1
more	1
positive.	1
She	1
had	1
no	1
such	1
object	1
for	1
her	1
lingering	1
thoughts	1
to	1
fix	1
on,	1
she	1
left	1
no	1
creature	1
behind,	1
from	1
whom	1
it	1
would	1
give	1
her	1
a	1
moment's	1
regret	1
to	1
be	1
divided	1
for	1
ever,	1
she	1
was	1
pleased	1
to	1
be	1
free	1
herself	1
from	1
the	1
persecution	1
of	1
Lucy's	1
friendship,	1
she	1
was	1
grateful	1
for	1
bringing	1
her	1
sister	1
away	1
unseen	1
by	1
Willoughby	1
since	1
his	1
marriage,	1
and	1
she	1
looked	1
forward	1
with	1
hope	1
to	1
what	1
a	1
few	1
months	1
of	1
tranquility	1
at	1
Barton	1
might	1
do	1
towards	1
restoring	1
Marianne's	1
peace	1
of	1
mind,	1
and	1
confirming	1
her	1
own.	1
Their	1
journey	1
was	1
safely	1
performed.	1
The	1
second	1
day	1
brought	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
cherished,	1
or	1
the	1
prohibited,	1
county	1
of	1
Somerset,	1
for	1
as	1
such	1
was	1
it	1
dwelt	1
on	1
by	1
turns	1
in	1
Marianne's	1
imagination;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
forenoon	1
of	1
the	1
third	1
they	1
drove	1
up	1
to	1
Cleveland.	1
Cleveland	1
was	1
a	1
spacious,	1
modern-built	1
house,	1
situated	1
on	1
a	1
sloping	1
lawn.	1
It	1
had	1
no	1
park,	1
but	1
the	1
pleasure-grounds	1
were	1
tolerably	1
extensive;	1
and	1
like	1
every	1
other	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
degree	1
of	1
importance,	1
it	1
had	1
its	1
open	1
shrubbery,	1
and	1
closer	1
wood	1
walk,	1
a	1
road	1
of	1
smooth	1
gravel	1
winding	1
round	1
a	1
plantation,	1
led	1
to	1
the	1
front,	1
the	1
lawn	1
was	1
dotted	1
over	1
with	1
timber,	1
the	1
house	1
itself	1
was	1
under	1
the	1
guardianship	1
of	1
the	1
fir,	1
the	1
mountain-ash,	1
and	1
the	1
acacia,	1
and	1
a	1
thick	1
screen	1
of	1
them	1
altogether,	1
interspersed	1
with	1
tall	1
Lombardy	1
poplars,	1
shut	1
out	1
the	1
offices.	1
Marianne	1
entered	1
the	1
house	1
with	1
a	1
heart	1
swelling	1
with	1
emotion	1
from	1
the	1
consciousness	1
of	1
being	1
only	1
eighty	1
miles	1
from	1
Barton,	1
and	1
not	1
thirty	1
from	1
Combe	1
Magna;	1
and	1
before	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
five	1
minutes	1
within	1
its	1
walls,	1
while	1
the	1
others	1
were	1
busily	1
helping	1
Charlotte	1
to	1
show	1
her	1
child	1
to	1
the	1
housekeeper,	1
she	1
quitted	1
it	1
again,	1
stealing	1
away	1
through	1
the	1
winding	1
shrubberies,	1
now	1
just	1
beginning	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
beauty,	1
to	1
gain	1
a	1
distant	1
eminence;	1
where,	1
from	1
its	1
Grecian	1
temple,	1
her	1
eye,	1
wandering	1
over	1
a	1
wide	1
tract	1
of	1
country	1
to	1
the	1
south-east,	1
could	1
fondly	1
rest	1
on	1
the	1
farthest	1
ridge	1
of	1
hills	1
in	1
the	1
horizon,	1
and	1
fancy	1
that	1
from	1
their	1
summits	1
Combe	1
Magna	1
might	1
be	1
seen.	1
In	1
such	1
moments	1
of	1
precious,	1
invaluable	1
misery,	1
she	1
rejoiced	1
in	1
tears	1
of	1
agony	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
Cleveland;	1
and	1
as	1
she	1
returned	1
by	1
a	1
different	1
circuit	1
to	1
the	1
house,	1
feeling	1
all	1
the	1
happy	1
privilege	1
of	1
country	1
liberty,	1
of	1
wandering	1
from	1
place	1
to	1
place	1
in	1
free	1
and	1
luxurious	1
solitude,	1
she	1
resolved	1
to	1
spend	1
almost	1
every	1
hour	1
of	1
every	1
day	1
while	1
she	1
remained	1
with	1
the	1
Palmers,	1
in	1
the	1
indulgence	1
of	1
such	1
solitary	1
rambles.	1
She	1
returned	1
just	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
join	1
the	1
others	1
as	1
they	1
quitted	1
the	1
house,	1
on	1
an	1
excursion	1
through	1
its	1
more	1
immediate	1
premises;	1
and	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
morning	1
was	1
easily	1
whiled	1
away,	1
in	1
lounging	1
round	1
the	1
kitchen	1
garden,	1
examining	1
the	1
bloom	1
upon	1
its	1
walls,	1
and	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
gardener's	1
lamentations	1
upon	1
blights,	1
in	1
dawdling	1
through	1
the	1
green-house,	1
where	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
her	1
favourite	1
plants,	1
unwarily	1
exposed,	1
and	1
nipped	1
by	1
the	1
lingering	1
frost,	1
raised	1
the	1
laughter	1
of	1
Charlotte,--and	1
in	1
visiting	1
her	1
poultry-yard,	1
where,	1
in	1
the	1
disappointed	1
hopes	1
of	1
her	1
dairy-maid,	1
by	1
hens	1
forsaking	1
their	1
nests,	1
or	1
being	1
stolen	1
by	1
a	1
fox,	1
or	1
in	1
the	1
rapid	1
decrease	1
of	1
a	1
promising	1
young	1
brood,	1
she	1
found	1
fresh	1
sources	1
of	1
merriment.	1
The	1
morning	1
was	1
fine	1
and	1
dry,	1
and	1
Marianne,	1
in	1
her	1
plan	1
of	1
employment	1
abroad,	1
had	1
not	1
calculated	1
for	1
any	1
change	1
of	1
weather	1
during	1
their	1
stay	1
at	1
Cleveland.	1
With	1
great	1
surprise	1
therefore,	1
did	1
she	1
find	1
herself	1
prevented	1
by	1
a	1
settled	1
rain	1
from	1
going	1
out	1
again	1
after	1
dinner.	1
She	1
had	1
depended	1
on	1
a	1
twilight	1
walk	1
to	1
the	1
Grecian	1
temple,	1
and	1
perhaps	1
all	1
over	1
the	1
grounds,	1
and	1
an	1
evening	1
merely	1
cold	1
or	1
damp	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
deterred	1
her	1
from	1
it;	1
but	1
a	1
heavy	1
and	1
settled	1
rain	1
even	1
SHE	1
could	1
not	1
fancy	1
dry	1
or	1
pleasant	1
weather	1
for	1
walking.	1
Their	1
party	1
was	1
small,	1
and	1
the	1
hours	1
passed	1
quietly	1
away.	1
Mrs.	1
Palmer	1
had	1
her	1
child,	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
her	1
carpet-work;	1
they	1
talked	1
of	1
the	1
friends	1
they	1
had	1
left	1
behind,	1
arranged	1
Lady	1
Middleton's	1
engagements,	1
and	1
wondered	1
whether	1
Mr.	1
Palmer	1
and	1
Colonel	1
Brandon	1
would	1
get	1
farther	1
than	1
Reading	1
that	1
night.	1
Elinor,	1
however	1
little	1
concerned	1
in	1
it,	1
joined	1
in	1
their	1
discourse;	1
and	1
Marianne,	1
who	1
had	1
the	1
knack	1
of	1
finding	1
her	1
way	1
in	1
every	1
house	1
to	1
the	1
library,	1
however	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
avoided	1
by	1
the	1
family	1
in	1
general,	1
soon	1
procured	1
herself	1
a	1
book.	1
Nothing	1
was	1
wanting	1
on	1
Mrs.	1
Palmer's	1
side	1
that	1
constant	1
and	1
friendly	1
good	1
humour	1
could	1
do,	1
to	1
make	1
them	1
feel	1
themselves	1
welcome.	1
The	1
openness	1
and	1
heartiness	1
of	1
her	1
manner	1
more	1
than	1
atoned	1
for	1
that	1
want	1
of	1
recollection	1
and	1
elegance	1
which	1
made	1
her	1
often	1
deficient	1
in	1
the	1
forms	1
of	1
politeness;	1
her	1
kindness,	1
recommended	1
by	1
so	1
pretty	1
a	1
face,	1
was	1
engaging;	1
her	1
folly,	1
though	1
evident	1
was	1
not	1
disgusting,	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
conceited;	1
and	1
Elinor	1
could	1
have	1
forgiven	1
every	1
thing	1
but	1
her	1
laugh.	1
The	1
two	1
gentlemen	1
arrived	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
to	1
a	1
very	1
late	1
dinner,	1
affording	1
a	1
pleasant	1
enlargement	1
of	1
the	1
party,	1
and	1
a	1
very	1
welcome	1
variety	1
to	1
their	1
conversation,	1
which	1
a	1
long	1
morning	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
continued	1
rain	1
had	1
reduced	1
very	1
low.	1
Elinor	1
had	1
seen	1
so	1
little	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Palmer,	1
and	1
in	1
that	1
little	1
had	1
seen	1
so	1
much	1
variety	1
in	1
his	1
address	1
to	1
her	1
sister	1
and	1
herself,	1
that	1
she	1
knew	1
not	1
what	1
to	1
expect	1
to	1
find	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
family.	1
She	1
found	1
him,	1
however,	1
perfectly	1
the	1
gentleman	1
in	1
his	1
behaviour	1
to	1
all	1
his	1
visitors,	1
and	1
only	1
occasionally	1
rude	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
her	1
mother;	1
she	1
found	1
him	1
very	1
capable	1
of	1
being	1
a	1
pleasant	1
companion,	1
and	1
only	1
prevented	1
from	1
being	1
so	1
always,	1
by	1
too	1
great	1
an	1
aptitude	1
to	1
fancy	1
himself	1
as	1
much	1
superior	1
to	1
people	1
in	1
general,	1
as	1
he	1
must	1
feel	1
himself	1
to	1
be	1
to	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
and	1
Charlotte.	1
For	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
his	1
character	1
and	1
habits,	1
they	1
were	1
marked,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
Elinor	1
could	1
perceive,	1
with	1
no	1
traits	1
at	1
all	1
unusual	1
in	1
his	1
sex	1
and	1
time	1
of	1
life.	1
He	1
was	1
nice	1
in	1
his	1
eating,	1
uncertain	1
in	1
his	1
hours;	1
fond	1
of	1
his	1
child,	1
though	1
affecting	1
to	1
slight	1
it;	1
and	1
idled	1
away	1
the	1
mornings	1
at	1
billiards,	1
which	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
devoted	1
to	1
business.	1
She	1
liked	1
him,	1
however,	1
upon	1
the	1
whole,	1
much	1
better	1
than	1
she	1
had	1
expected,	1
and	1
in	1
her	1
heart	1
was	1
not	1
sorry	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
like	1
him	1
no	1
more;--	1
not	1
sorry	1
to	1
be	1
driven	1
by	1
the	1
observation	1
of	1
his	1
Epicurism,	1
his	1
selfishness,	1
and	1
his	1
conceit,	1
to	1
rest	1
with	1
complacency	1
on	1
the	1
remembrance	1
of	1
Edward's	1
generous	1
temper,	1
simple	1
taste,	1
and	1
diffident	1
feelings.	1
Of	1
Edward,	1
or	1
at	1
least	1
of	1
some	1
of	1
his	1
concerns,	1
she	1
now	1
received	1
intelligence	1
from	1
Colonel	1
Brandon,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
into	1
Dorsetshire	1
lately;	1
and	1
who,	1
treating	1
her	1
at	1
once	1
as	1
the	1
disinterested	1
friend	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Ferrars,	1
and	1
the	1
kind	1
of	1
confidant	1
of	1
himself,	1
talked	1
to	1
her	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
the	1
parsonage	1
at	1
Delaford,	1
described	1
its	1
deficiencies,	1
and	1
told	1
her	1
what	1
he	1
meant	1
to	1
do	1
himself	1
towards	1
removing	1
them.--His	1
behaviour	1
to	1
her	1
in	1
this,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
in	1
every	1
other	1
particular,	1
his	1
open	1
pleasure	1
in	1
meeting	1
her	1
after	1
an	1
absence	1
of	1
only	1
ten	1
days,	1
his	1
readiness	1
to	1
converse	1
with	1
her,	1
and	1
his	1
deference	1
for	1
her	1
opinion,	1
might	1
very	1
well	1
justify	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings's	1
persuasion	1
of	1
his	1
attachment,	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
enough,	1
perhaps,	1
had	1
not	1
Elinor	1
still,	1
as	1
from	1
the	1
first,	1
believed	1
Marianne	1
his	1
real	1
favourite,	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
suspect	1
it	1
herself.	1
But	1
as	1
it	1
was,	1
such	1
a	1
notion	1
had	1
scarcely	1
ever	1
entered	1
her	1
head,	1
except	1
by	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings's	1
suggestion;	1
and	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
believing	1
herself	1
the	1
nicest	1
observer	1
of	1
the	1
two;--she	1
watched	1
his	1
eyes,	1
while	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
thought	1
only	1
of	1
his	1
behaviour;--and	1
while	1
his	1
looks	1
of	1
anxious	1
solicitude	1
on	1
Marianne's	1
feeling,	1
in	1
her	1
head	1
and	1
throat,	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
a	1
heavy	1
cold,	1
because	1
unexpressed	1
by	1
words,	1
entirely	1
escaped	1
the	1
latter	1
lady's	1
observation;--SHE	1
could	1
discover	1
in	1
them	1
the	1
quick	1
feelings,	1
and	1
needless	1
alarm	1
of	1
a	1
lover.	1
Two	1
delighful	1
twilight	1
walks	1
on	1
the	1
third	1
and	1
fourth	1
evenings	1
of	1
her	1
being	1
there,	1
not	1
merely	1
on	1
the	1
dry	1
gravel	1
of	1
the	1
shrubbery,	1
but	1
all	1
over	1
the	1
grounds,	1
and	1
especially	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
distant	1
parts	1
of	1
them,	1
where	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
more	1
of	1
wildness	1
than	1
in	1
the	1
rest,	1
where	1
the	1
trees	1
were	1
the	1
oldest,	1
and	1
the	1
grass	1
was	1
the	1
longest	1
and	1
wettest,	1
had--assisted	1
by	1
the	1
still	1
greater	1
imprudence	1
of	1
sitting	1
in	1
her	1
wet	1
shoes	1
and	1
stockings--given	1
Marianne	1
a	1
cold	1
so	1
violent	1
as,	1
though	1
for	1
a	1
day	1
or	1
two	1
trifled	1
with	1
or	1
denied,	1
would	1
force	1
itself	1
by	1
increasing	1
ailments	1
on	1
the	1
concern	1
of	1
every	1
body,	1
and	1
the	1
notice	1
of	1
herself.	1
Prescriptions	1
poured	1
in	1
from	1
all	1
quarters,	1
and	1
as	1
usual,	1
were	1
all	1
declined.	1
Though	1
heavy	1
and	1
feverish,	1
with	1
a	1
pain	1
in	1
her	1
limbs,	1
and	1
a	1
cough,	1
and	1
a	1
sore	1
throat,	1
a	1
good	1
night's	1
rest	1
was	1
to	1
cure	1
her	1
entirely;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
with	1
difficulty	1
that	1
Elinor	1
prevailed	1
on	1
her,	1
when	1
she	1
went	1
to	1
bed,	1
to	1
try	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
of	1
the	1
simplest	1
of	1
the	1
remedies.	1
CHAPTER	1
43	1
Marianne	1
got	1
up	1
the	1
next	1
morning	1
at	1
her	1
usual	1
time;	1
to	1
every	1
inquiry	1
replied	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
better,	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
prove	1
herself	1
so,	1
by	1
engaging	1
in	1
her	1
accustomary	1
employments.	1
But	1
a	1
day	1
spent	1
in	1
sitting	1
shivering	1
over	1
the	1
fire	1
with	1
a	1
book	1
in	1
her	1
hand,	1
which	1
she	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
read,	1
or	1
in	1
lying,	1
weary	1
and	1
languid,	1
on	1
a	1
sofa,	1
did	1
not	1
speak	1
much	1
in	1
favour	1
of	1
her	1
amendment;	1
and	1
when,	1
at	1
last,	1
she	1
went	1
early	1
to	1
bed,	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
indisposed,	1
Colonel	1
Brandon	1
was	1
only	1
astonished	1
at	1
her	1
sister's	1
composure,	1
who,	1
though	1
attending	1
and	1
nursing	1
her	1
the	1
whole	1
day,	1
against	1
Marianne	1
inclination,	1
and	1
forcing	1
proper	1
medicines	1
on	1
her	1
at	1
night,	1
trusted,	1
like	1
Marianne,	1
to	1
the	1
certainty	1
and	1
efficacy	1
of	1
sleep,	1
and	1
felt	1
no	1
real	1
alarm.	1
A	1
very	1
restless	1
and	1
feverish	1
night,	1
however,	1
disappointed	1
the	1
expectation	1
of	1
both;	1
and	1
when	1
Marianne,	1
after	1
persisting	1
in	1
rising,	1
confessed	1
herself	1
unable	1
to	1
sit	1
up,	1
and	1
returned	1
voluntarily	1
to	1
her	1
bed,	1
Elinor	1
was	1
very	1
ready	1
to	1
adopt	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings's	1
advice,	1
of	1
sending	1
for	1
the	1
Palmers'	1
apothecary.	1
He	1
came,	1
examined	1
his	1
patient,	1
and	1
though	1
encouraging	1
Miss	1
Dashwood	1
to	1
expect	1
that	1
a	1
very	1
few	1
days	1
would	1
restore	1
her	1
sister	1
to	1
health,	1
yet,	1
by	1
pronouncing	1
her	1
disorder	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
putrid	1
tendency,	1
and	1
allowing	1
the	1
word	1
"infection"	1
to	1
pass	1
his	1
lips,	1
gave	1
instant	1
alarm	1
to	1
Mrs.	1
Palmer,	1
on	1
her	1
baby's	1
account.	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
inclined	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
think	1
Marianne's	1
complaint	1
more	1
serious	1
than	1
Elinor,	1
now	1
looked	1
very	1
grave	1
on	1
Mr.	1
Harris's	1
report,	1
and	1
confirming	1
Charlotte's	1
fears	1
and	1
caution,	1
urged	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
her	1
immediate	1
removal	1
with	1
her	1
infant;	1
and	1
Mr.	1
Palmer,	1
though	1
treating	1
their	1
apprehensions	1
as	1
idle,	1
found	1
the	1
anxiety	1
and	1
importunity	1
of	1
his	1
wife	1
too	1
great	1
to	1
be	1
withstood.	1
Her	1
departure,	1
therefore,	1
was	1
fixed	1
on;	1
and	1
within	1
an	1
hour	1
after	1
Mr.	1
Harris's	1
arrival,	1
she	1
set	1
off,	1
with	1
her	1
little	1
boy	1
and	1
his	1
nurse,	1
for	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
a	1
near	1
relation	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Palmer's,	1
who	1
lived	1
a	1
few	1
miles	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
Bath;	1
whither	1
her	1
husband	1
promised,	1
at	1
her	1
earnest	1
entreaty,	1
to	1
join	1
her	1
in	1
a	1
day	1
or	1
two;	1
and	1
whither	1
she	1
was	1
almost	1
equally	1
urgent	1
with	1
her	1
mother	1
to	1
accompany	1
her.	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings,	1
however,	1
with	1
a	1
kindness	1
of	1
heart	1
which	1
made	1
Elinor	1
really	1
love	1
her,	1
declared	1
her	1
resolution	1
of	1
not	1
stirring	1
from	1
Cleveland	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
Marianne	1
remained	1
ill,	1
and	1
of	1
endeavouring,	1
by	1
her	1
own	1
attentive	1
care,	1
to	1
supply	1
to	1
her	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
mother	1
she	1
had	1
taken	1
her	1
from;	1
and	1
Elinor	1
found	1
her	1
on	1
every	1
occasion	1
a	1
most	1
willing	1
and	1
active	1
helpmate,	1
desirous	1
to	1
share	1
in	1
all	1
her	1
fatigues,	1
and	1
often	1
by	1
her	1
better	1
experience	1
in	1
nursing,	1
of	1
material	1
use.	1
Poor	1
Marianne,	1
languid	1
and	1
low	1
from	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
her	1
malady,	1
and	1
feeling	1
herself	1
universally	1
ill,	1
could	1
no	1
longer	1
hope	1
that	1
tomorrow	1
would	1
find	1
her	1
recovered;	1
and	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
what	1
tomorrow	1
would	1
have	1
produced,	1
but	1
for	1
this	1
unlucky	1
illness,	1
made	1
every	1
ailment	1
severe;	1
for	1
on	1
that	1
day	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
have	1
begun	1
their	1
journey	1
home;	1
and,	1
attended	1
the	1
whole	1
way	1
by	1
a	1
servant	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings,	1
were	1
to	1
have	1
taken	1
their	1
mother	1
by	1
surprise	1
on	1
the	1
following	1
forenoon.	1
The	1
little	1
she	1
said	1
was	1
all	1
in	1
lamentation	1
of	1
this	1
inevitable	1
delay;	1
though	1
Elinor	1
tried	1
to	1
raise	1
her	1
spirits,	1
and	1
make	1
her	1
believe,	1
as	1
she	1
THEN	1
really	1
believed	1
herself,	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
very	1
short	1
one.	1
The	1
next	1
day	1
produced	1
little	1
or	1
no	1
alteration	1
in	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
the	1
patient;	1
she	1
certainly	1
was	1
not	1
better,	1
and,	1
except	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
amendment,	1
did	1
not	1
appear	1
worse.	1
Their	1
party	1
was	1
now	1
farther	1
reduced;	1
for	1
Mr.	1
Palmer,	1
though	1
very	1
unwilling	1
to	1
go	1
as	1
well	1
from	1
real	1
humanity	1
and	1
good-nature,	1
as	1
from	1
a	1
dislike	1
of	1
appearing	1
to	1
be	1
frightened	1
away	1
by	1
his	1
wife,	1
was	1
persuaded	1
at	1
last	1
by	1
Colonel	1
Brandon	1
to	1
perform	1
his	1
promise	1
of	1
following	1
her;	1
and	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
preparing	1
to	1
go,	1
Colonel	1
Brandon	1
himself,	1
with	1
a	1
much	1
greater	1
exertion,	1
began	1
to	1
talk	1
of	1
going	1
likewise.--Here,	1
however,	1
the	1
kindness	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
interposed	1
most	1
acceptably;	1
for	1
to	1
send	1
the	1
Colonel	1
away	1
while	1
his	1
love	1
was	1
in	1
so	1
much	1
uneasiness	1
on	1
her	1
sister's	1
account,	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
deprive	1
them	1
both,	1
she	1
thought,	1
of	1
every	1
comfort;	1
and	1
therefore	1
telling	1
him	1
at	1
once	1
that	1
his	1
stay	1
at	1
Cleveland	1
was	1
necessary	1
to	1
herself,	1
that	1
she	1
should	1
want	1
him	1
to	1
play	1
at	1
piquet	1
of	1
an	1
evening,	1
while	1
Miss	1
Dashwood	1
was	1
above	1
with	1
her	1
sister,	1
&c.	1
she	1
urged	1
him	1
so	1
strongly	1
to	1
remain,	1
that	1
he,	1
who	1
was	1
gratifying	1
the	1
first	1
wish	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
heart	1
by	1
a	1
compliance,	1
could	1
not	1
long	1
even	1
affect	1
to	1
demur;	1
especially	1
as	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings's	1
entreaty	1
was	1
warmly	1
seconded	1
by	1
Mr.	1
Palmer,	1
who	1
seemed	1
to	1
feel	1
a	1
relief	1
to	1
himself,	1
in	1
leaving	1
behind	1
him	1
a	1
person	1
so	1
well	1
able	1
to	1
assist	1
or	1
advise	1
Miss	1
Dashwood	1
in	1
any	1
emergence.	1
Marianne	1
was,	1
of	1
course,	1
kept	1
in	1
ignorance	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
arrangements.	1
She	1
knew	1
not	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
sending	1
the	1
owners	1
of	1
Cleveland	1
away,	1
in	1
about	1
seven	1
days	1
from	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
their	1
arrival.	1
It	1
gave	1
her	1
no	1
surprise	1
that	1
she	1
saw	1
nothing	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
Palmer;	1
and	1
as	1
it	1
gave	1
her	1
likewise	1
no	1
concern,	1
she	1
never	1
mentioned	1
her	1
name.	1
Two	1
days	1
passed	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Palmer's	1
departure,	1
and	1
her	1
situation	1
continued,	1
with	1
little	1
variation,	1
the	1
same.	1
Mr.	1
Harris,	1
who	1
attended	1
her	1
every	1
day,	1
still	1
talked	1
boldly	1
of	1
a	1
speedy	1
recovery,	1
and	1
Miss	1
Dashwood	1
was	1
equally	1
sanguine;	1
but	1
the	1
expectation	1
of	1
the	1
others	1
was	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
so	1
cheerful.	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
had	1
determined	1
very	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
seizure	1
that	1
Marianne	1
would	1
never	1
get	1
over	1
it,	1
and	1
Colonel	1
Brandon,	1
who	1
was	1
chiefly	1
of	1
use	1
in	1
listening	1
to	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings's	1
forebodings,	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
mind	1
to	1
resist	1
their	1
influence.	1
He	1
tried	1
to	1
reason	1
himself	1
out	1
of	1
fears,	1
which	1
the	1
different	1
judgment	1
of	1
the	1
apothecary	1
seemed	1
to	1
render	1
absurd;	1
but	1
the	1
many	1
hours	1
of	1
each	1
day	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
left	1
entirely	1
alone,	1
were	1
but	1
too	1
favourable	1
for	1
the	1
admission	1
of	1
every	1
melancholy	1
idea,	1
and	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
expel	1
from	1
his	1
mind	1
the	1
persuasion	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
see	1
Marianne	1
no	1
more.	1
On	1
the	1
morning	1
of	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
however,	1
the	1
gloomy	1
anticipations	1
of	1
both	1
were	1
almost	1
done	1
away;	1
for	1
when	1
Mr.	1
Harris	1
arrived,	1
he	1
declared	1
his	1
patient	1
materially	1
better.	1
Her	1
pulse	1
was	1
much	1
stronger,	1
and	1
every	1
symptom	1
more	1
favourable	1
than	1
on	1
the	1
preceding	1
visit.	1
Elinor,	1
confirmed	1
in	1
every	1
pleasant	1
hope,	1
was	1
all	1
cheerfulness;	1
rejoicing	1
that	1
in	1
her	1
letters	1
to	1
her	1
mother,	1
she	1
had	1
pursued	1
her	1
own	1
judgment	1
rather	1
than	1
her	1
friend's,	1
in	1
making	1
very	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
indisposition	1
which	1
delayed	1
them	1
at	1
Cleveland;	1
and	1
almost	1
fixing	1
on	1
the	1
time	1
when	1
Marianne	1
would	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
travel.	1
But	1
the	1
day	1
did	1
not	1
close	1
so	1
auspiciously	1
as	1
it	1
began.--	1
Towards	1
the	1
evening	1
Marianne	1
became	1
ill	1
again,	1
growing	1
more	1
heavy,	1
restless,	1
and	1
uncomfortable	1
than	1
before.	1
Her	1
sister,	1
however,	1
still	1
sanguine,	1
was	1
willing	1
to	1
attribute	1
the	1
change	1
to	1
nothing	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
fatigue	1
of	1
having	1
sat	1
up	1
to	1
have	1
her	1
bed	1
made;	1
and	1
carefully	1
administering	1
the	1
cordials	1
prescribed,	1
saw	1
her,	1
with	1
satisfaction,	1
sink	1
at	1
last	1
into	1
a	1
slumber,	1
from	1
which	1
she	1
expected	1
the	1
most	1
beneficial	1
effects.	1
Her	1
sleep,	1
though	1
not	1
so	1
quiet	1
as	1
Elinor	1
wished	1
to	1
see	1
it,	1
lasted	1
a	1
considerable	1
time;	1
and	1
anxious	1
to	1
observe	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
it	1
herself,	1
she	1
resolved	1
to	1
sit	1
with	1
her	1
during	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
it.	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings,	1
knowing	1
nothing	1
of	1
any	1
change	1
in	1
the	1
patient,	1
went	1
unusually	1
early	1
to	1
bed;	1
her	1
maid,	1
who	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
principal	1
nurses,	1
was	1
recreating	1
herself	1
in	1
the	1
housekeeper's	1
room,	1
and	1
Elinor	1
remained	1
alone	1
with	1
Marianne.	1
The	1
repose	1
of	1
the	1
latter	1
became	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
disturbed;	1
and	1
her	1
sister,	1
who	1
watched,	1
with	1
unremitting	1
attention	1
her	1
continual	1
change	1
of	1
posture,	1
and	1
heard	1
the	1
frequent	1
but	1
inarticulate	1
sounds	1
of	1
complaint	1
which	1
passed	1
her	1
lips,	1
was	1
almost	1
wishing	1
to	1
rouse	1
her	1
from	1
so	1
painful	1
a	1
slumber,	1
when	1
Marianne,	1
suddenly	1
awakened	1
by	1
some	1
accidental	1
noise	1
in	1
the	1
house,	1
started	1
hastily	1
up,	1
and,	1
with	1
feverish	1
wildness,	1
cried	1
out,--	1
"Is	1
mama	1
coming?--"	1
"Not	1
yet,"	1
cried	1
the	1
other,	1
concealing	1
her	1
terror,	1
and	1
assisting	1
Marianne	1
to	1
lie	1
down	1
again,	1
"but	1
she	1
will	1
be	1
here,	1
I	1
hope,	1
before	1
it	1
is	1
long.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
way,	1
you	1
know,	1
from	1
hence	1
to	1
Barton."	1
"But	1
she	1
must	1
not	1
go	1
round	1
by	1
London,"	1
cried	1
Marianne,	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
hurried	1
manner.	1
"I	1
shall	1
never	1
see	1
her,	1
if	1
she	1
goes	1
by	1
London."	1
Elinor	1
perceived	1
with	1
alarm	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
quite	1
herself,	1
and,	1
while	1
attempting	1
to	1
soothe	1
her,	1
eagerly	1
felt	1
her	1
pulse.	1
It	1
was	1
lower	1
and	1
quicker	1
than	1
ever!	1
and	1
Marianne,	1
still	1
talking	1
wildly	1
of	1
mama,	1
her	1
alarm	1
increased	1
so	1
rapidly,	1
as	1
to	1
determine	1
her	1
on	1
sending	1
instantly	1
for	1
Mr.	1
Harris,	1
and	1
despatching	1
a	1
messenger	1
to	1
Barton	1
for	1
her	1
mother.	1
To	1
consult	1
with	1
Colonel	1
Brandon	1
on	1
the	1
best	1
means	1
of	1
effecting	1
the	1
latter,	1
was	1
a	1
thought	1
which	1
immediately	1
followed	1
the	1
resolution	1
of	1
its	1
performance;	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
she	1
had	1
rung	1
up	1
the	1
maid	1
to	1
take	1
her	1
place	1
by	1
her	1
sister,	1
she	1
hastened	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
drawing-room,	1
where	1
she	1
knew	1
he	1
was	1
generally	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
at	1
a	1
much	1
later	1
hour	1
than	1
the	1
present.	1
It	1
was	1
no	1
time	1
for	1
hesitation.	1
Her	1
fears	1
and	1
her	1
difficulties	1
were	1
immediately	1
before	1
him.	1
Her	1
fears,	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
courage,	1
no	1
confidence	1
to	1
attempt	1
the	1
removal	1
of:--	1
he	1
listened	1
to	1
them	1
in	1
silent	1
despondence;--but	1
her	1
difficulties	1
were	1
instantly	1
obviated,	1
for	1
with	1
a	1
readiness	1
that	1
seemed	1
to	1
speak	1
the	1
occasion,	1
and	1
the	1
service	1
pre-arranged	1
in	1
his	1
mind,	1
he	1
offered	1
himself	1
as	1
the	1
messenger	1
who	1
should	1
fetch	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood.	1
Elinor	1
made	1
no	1
resistance	1
that	1
was	1
not	1
easily	1
overcome.	1
She	1
thanked	1
him	1
with	1
brief,	1
though	1
fervent	1
gratitude,	1
and	1
while	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
hurry	1
off	1
his	1
servant	1
with	1
a	1
message	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Harris,	1
and	1
an	1
order	1
for	1
post-horses	1
directly,	1
she	1
wrote	1
a	1
few	1
lines	1
to	1
her	1
mother.	1
The	1
comfort	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
friend	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
as	1
Colonel	1
Brandon--or	1
such	1
a	1
companion	1
for	1
her	1
mother,--how	1
gratefully	1
was	1
it	1
felt!--a	1
companion	1
whose	1
judgment	1
would	1
guide,	1
whose	1
attendance	1
must	1
relieve,	1
and	1
whose	1
friendship	1
might	1
soothe	1
her!--as	1
far	1
as	1
the	1
shock	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
summons	1
COULD	1
be	1
lessened	1
to	1
her,	1
his	1
presence,	1
his	1
manners,	1
his	1
assistance,	1
would	1
lessen	1
it.	1
HE,	1
meanwhile,	1
whatever	1
he	1
might	1
feel,	1
acted	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
firmness	1
of	1
a	1
collected	1
mind,	1
made	1
every	1
necessary	1
arrangement	1
with	1
the	1
utmost	1
despatch,	1
and	1
calculated	1
with	1
exactness	1
the	1
time	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
might	1
look	1
for	1
his	1
return.	1
Not	1
a	1
moment	1
was	1
lost	1
in	1
delay	1
of	1
any	1
kind.	1
The	1
horses	1
arrived,	1
even	1
before	1
they	1
were	1
expected,	1
and	1
Colonel	1
Brandon	1
only	1
pressing	1
her	1
hand	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
solemnity,	1
and	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
spoken	1
too	1
low	1
to	1
reach	1
her	1
ear,	1
hurried	1
into	1
the	1
carriage.	1
It	1
was	1
then	1
about	1
twelve	1
o'clock,	1
and	1
she	1
returned	1
to	1
her	1
sister's	1
apartment	1
to	1
wait	1
for	1
the	1
arrival	1
of	1
the	1
apothecary,	1
and	1
to	1
watch	1
by	1
her	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
night.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
night	1
of	1
almost	1
equal	1
suffering	1
to	1
both.	1
Hour	1
after	1
hour	1
passed	1
away	1
in	1
sleepless	1
pain	1
and	1
delirium	1
on	1
Marianne's	1
side,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
cruel	1
anxiety	1
on	1
Elinor's,	1
before	1
Mr.	1
Harris	1
appeared.	1
Her	1
apprehensions	1
once	1
raised,	1
paid	1
by	1
their	1
excess	1
for	1
all	1
her	1
former	1
security;	1
and	1
the	1
servant	1
who	1
sat	1
up	1
with	1
her,	1
for	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
allow	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
to	1
be	1
called,	1
only	1
tortured	1
her	1
more,	1
by	1
hints	1
of	1
what	1
her	1
mistress	1
had	1
always	1
thought.	1
Marianne's	1
ideas	1
were	1
still,	1
at	1
intervals,	1
fixed	1
incoherently	1
on	1
her	1
mother,	1
and	1
whenever	1
she	1
mentioned	1
her	1
name,	1
it	1
gave	1
a	1
pang	1
to	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
poor	1
Elinor,	1
who,	1
reproaching	1
herself	1
for	1
having	1
trifled	1
with	1
so	1
many	1
days	1
of	1
illness,	1
and	1
wretched	1
for	1
some	1
immediate	1
relief,	1
fancied	1
that	1
all	1
relief	1
might	1
soon	1
be	1
in	1
vain,	1
that	1
every	1
thing	1
had	1
been	1
delayed	1
too	1
long,	1
and	1
pictured	1
to	1
herself	1
her	1
suffering	1
mother	1
arriving	1
too	1
late	1
to	1
see	1
this	1
darling	1
child,	1
or	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
rational.	1
She	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
sending	1
again	1
for	1
Mr.	1
Harris,	1
or	1
if	1
HE	1
could	1
not	1
come,	1
for	1
some	1
other	1
advice,	1
when	1
the	1
former--but	1
not	1
till	1
after	1
five	1
o'clock--arrived.	1
His	1
opinion,	1
however,	1
made	1
some	1
little	1
amends	1
for	1
his	1
delay,	1
for	1
though	1
acknowledging	1
a	1
very	1
unexpected	1
and	1
unpleasant	1
alteration	1
in	1
his	1
patient,	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
allow	1
the	1
danger	1
to	1
be	1
material,	1
and	1
talked	1
of	1
the	1
relief	1
which	1
a	1
fresh	1
mode	1
of	1
treatment	1
must	1
procure,	1
with	1
a	1
confidence	1
which,	1
in	1
a	1
lesser	1
degree,	1
was	1
communicated	1
to	1
Elinor.	1
He	1
promised	1
to	1
call	1
again	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
three	1
or	1
four	1
hours,	1
and	1
left	1
both	1
the	1
patient	1
and	1
her	1
anxious	1
attendant	1
more	1
composed	1
than	1
he	1
had	1
found	1
them.	1
With	1
strong	1
concern,	1
and	1
with	1
many	1
reproaches	1
for	1
not	1
being	1
called	1
to	1
their	1
aid,	1
did	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
hear	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
of	1
what	1
had	1
passed.	1
Her	1
former	1
apprehensions,	1
now	1
with	1
greater	1
reason	1
restored,	1
left	1
her	1
no	1
doubt	1
of	1
the	1
event;	1
and	1
though	1
trying	1
to	1
speak	1
comfort	1
to	1
Elinor,	1
her	1
conviction	1
of	1
her	1
sister's	1
danger	1
would	1
not	1
allow	1
her	1
to	1
offer	1
the	1
comfort	1
of	1
hope.	1
Her	1
heart	1
was	1
really	1
grieved.	1
The	1
rapid	1
decay,	1
the	1
early	1
death	1
of	1
a	1
girl	1
so	1
young,	1
so	1
lovely	1
as	1
Marianne,	1
must	1
have	1
struck	1
a	1
less	1
interested	1
person	1
with	1
concern.	1
On	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings's	1
compassion	1
she	1
had	1
other	1
claims.	1
She	1
had	1
been	1
for	1
three	1
months	1
her	1
companion,	1
was	1
still	1
under	1
her	1
care,	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
known	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
greatly	1
injured,	1
and	1
long	1
unhappy.	1
The	1
distress	1
of	1
her	1
sister	1
too,	1
particularly	1
a	1
favourite,	1
was	1
before	1
her;--and	1
as	1
for	1
their	1
mother,	1
when	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
considered	1
that	1
Marianne	1
might	1
probably	1
be	1
to	1
HER	1
what	1
Charlotte	1
was	1
to	1
herself,	1
her	1
sympathy	1
in	1
HER	1
sufferings	1
was	1
very	1
sincere.	1
Mr.	1
Harris	1
was	1
punctual	1
in	1
his	1
second	1
visit;--	1
but	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
be	1
disappointed	1
in	1
his	1
hopes	1
of	1
what	1
the	1
last	1
would	1
produce.	1
His	1
medicines	1
had	1
failed;--the	1
fever	1
was	1
unabated;	1
and	1
Marianne	1
only	1
more	1
quiet--not	1
more	1
herself--remained	1
in	1
a	1
heavy	1
stupor.	1
Elinor,	1
catching	1
all,	1
and	1
more	1
than	1
all,	1
his	1
fears	1
in	1
a	1
moment,	1
proposed	1
to	1
call	1
in	1
further	1
advice.	1
But	1
he	1
judged	1
it	1
unnecessary:	1
he	1
had	1
still	1
something	1
more	1
to	1
try,	1
some	1
more	1
fresh	1
application,	1
of	1
whose	1
success	1
he	1
was	1
as	1
confident	1
as	1
the	1
last,	1
and	1
his	1
visit	1
concluded	1
with	1
encouraging	1
assurances	1
which	1
reached	1
the	1
ear,	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
enter	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
Miss	1
Dashwood.	1
She	1
was	1
calm,	1
except	1
when	1
she	1
thought	1
of	1
her	1
mother;	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
almost	1
hopeless;	1
and	1
in	1
this	1
state	1
she	1
continued	1
till	1
noon,	1
scarcely	1
stirring	1
from	1
her	1
sister's	1
bed,	1
her	1
thoughts	1
wandering	1
from	1
one	1
image	1
of	1
grief,	1
one	1
suffering	1
friend	1
to	1
another,	1
and	1
her	1
spirits	1
oppressed	1
to	1
the	1
utmost	1
by	1
the	1
conversation	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings,	1
who	1
scrupled	1
not	1
to	1
attribute	1
the	1
severity	1
and	1
danger	1
of	1
this	1
attack	1
to	1
the	1
many	1
weeks	1
of	1
previous	1
indisposition	1
which	1
Marianne's	1
disappointment	1
had	1
brought	1
on.	1
Elinor	1
felt	1
all	1
the	1
reasonableness	1
of	1
the	1
idea,	1
and	1
it	1
gave	1
fresh	1
misery	1
to	1
her	1
reflections.	1
About	1
noon,	1
however,	1
she	1
began--but	1
with	1
a	1
caution--a	1
dread	1
of	1
disappointment	1
which	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
kept	1
her	1
silent,	1
even	1
to	1
her	1
friend--to	1
fancy,	1
to	1
hope	1
she	1
could	1
perceive	1
a	1
slight	1
amendment	1
in	1
her	1
sister's	1
pulse;--she	1
waited,	1
watched,	1
and	1
examined	1
it	1
again	1
and	1
again;--and	1
at	1
last,	1
with	1
an	1
agitation	1
more	1
difficult	1
to	1
bury	1
under	1
exterior	1
calmness,	1
than	1
all	1
her	1
foregoing	1
distress,	1
ventured	1
to	1
communicate	1
her	1
hopes.	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings,	1
though	1
forced,	1
on	1
examination,	1
to	1
acknowledge	1
a	1
temporary	1
revival,	1
tried	1
to	1
keep	1
her	1
young	1
friend	1
from	1
indulging	1
a	1
thought	1
of	1
its	1
continuance;--	1
and	1
Elinor,	1
conning	1
over	1
every	1
injunction	1
of	1
distrust,	1
told	1
herself	1
likewise	1
not	1
to	1
hope.	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
too	1
late.	1
Hope	1
had	1
already	1
entered;	1
and	1
feeling	1
all	1
its	1
anxious	1
flutter,	1
she	1
bent	1
over	1
her	1
sister	1
to	1
watch--she	1
hardly	1
knew	1
for	1
what.	1
Half	1
an	1
hour	1
passed	1
away,	1
and	1
the	1
favourable	1
symptom	1
yet	1
blessed	1
her.	1
Others	1
even	1
arose	1
to	1
confirm	1
it.	1
Her	1
breath,	1
her	1
skin,	1
her	1
lips,	1
all	1
flattered	1
Elinor	1
with	1
signs	1
of	1
amendment;	1
and	1
Marianne	1
fixed	1
her	1
eyes	1
on	1
her	1
with	1
a	1
rational,	1
though	1
languid,	1
gaze.	1
Anxiety	1
and	1
hope	1
now	1
oppressed	1
her	1
in	1
equal	1
degrees,	1
and	1
left	1
her	1
no	1
moment	1
of	1
tranquillity	1
till	1
the	1
arrival	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Harris	1
at	1
four	1
o'clock;--when	1
his	1
assurances,	1
his	1
felicitations	1
on	1
a	1
recovery	1
in	1
her	1
sister	1
even	1
surpassing	1
his	1
expectation,	1
gave	1
her	1
confidence,	1
comfort,	1
and	1
tears	1
of	1
joy.	1
Marianne	1
was	1
in	1
every	1
respect	1
materially	1
better,	1
and	1
he	1
declared	1
her	1
entirely	1
out	1
of	1
danger.	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings,	1
perhaps	1
satisfied	1
with	1
the	1
partial	1
justification	1
of	1
her	1
forebodings	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
found	1
in	1
their	1
late	1
alarm,	1
allowed	1
herself	1
to	1
trust	1
in	1
his	1
judgment,	1
and	1
admitted,	1
with	1
unfeigned	1
joy,	1
and	1
soon	1
with	1
unequivocal	1
cheerfulness,	1
the	1
probability	1
of	1
an	1
entire	1
recovery.	1
Elinor	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
cheerful.	1
Her	1
joy	1
was	1
of	1
a	1
different	1
kind,	1
and	1
led	1
to	1
any	1
thing	1
rather	1
than	1
to	1
gaiety.	1
Marianne	1
restored	1
to	1
life,	1
health,	1
friends,	1
and	1
to	1
her	1
doting	1
mother,	1
was	1
an	1
idea	1
to	1
fill	1
her	1
heart	1
with	1
sensations	1
of	1
exquisite	1
comfort,	1
and	1
expand	1
it	1
in	1
fervent	1
gratitude;--	1
but	1
it	1
lead	1
to	1
no	1
outward	1
demonstrations	1
of	1
joy,	1
no	1
words,	1
no	1
smiles.	1
All	1
within	1
Elinor's	1
breast	1
was	1
satisfaction,	1
silent	1
and	1
strong.	1
She	1
continued	1
by	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
her	1
sister,	1
with	1
little	1
intermission	1
the	1
whole	1
afternoon,	1
calming	1
every	1
fear,	1
satisfying	1
every	1
inquiry	1
of	1
her	1
enfeebled	1
spirits,	1
supplying	1
every	1
succour,	1
and	1
watching	1
almost	1
every	1
look	1
and	1
every	1
breath.	1
The	1
possibility	1
of	1
a	1
relapse	1
would	1
of	1
course,	1
in	1
some	1
moments,	1
occur	1
to	1
remind	1
her	1
of	1
what	1
anxiety	1
was--	1
but	1
when	1
she	1
saw,	1
on	1
her	1
frequent	1
and	1
minute	1
examination,	1
that	1
every	1
symptom	1
of	1
recovery	1
continued,	1
and	1
saw	1
Marianne	1
at	1
six	1
o'clock	1
sink	1
into	1
a	1
quiet,	1
steady,	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
appearance	1
comfortable,	1
sleep,	1
she	1
silenced	1
every	1
doubt.	1
The	1
time	1
was	1
now	1
drawing	1
on,	1
when	1
Colonel	1
Brandon	1
might	1
be	1
expected	1
back.	1
At	1
ten	1
o'clock,	1
she	1
trusted,	1
or	1
at	1
least	1
not	1
much	1
later	1
her	1
mother	1
would	1
be	1
relieved	1
from	1
the	1
dreadful	1
suspense	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
must	1
now	1
be	1
travelling	1
towards	1
them.	1
The	1
Colonel,	1
too!--perhaps	1
scarcely	1
less	1
an	1
object	1
of	1
pity!--Oh!--how	1
slow	1
was	1
the	1
progress	1
of	1
time	1
which	1
yet	1
kept	1
them	1
in	1
ignorance!	1
At	1
seven	1
o'clock,	1
leaving	1
Marianne	1
still	1
sweetly	1
asleep,	1
she	1
joined	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
in	1
the	1
drawing-room	1
to	1
tea.	1
Of	1
breakfast	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
kept	1
by	1
her	1
fears,	1
and	1
of	1
dinner	1
by	1
their	1
sudden	1
reverse,	1
from	1
eating	1
much;--	1
and	1
the	1
present	1
refreshment,	1
therefore,	1
with	1
such	1
feelings	1
of	1
content	1
as	1
she	1
brought	1
to	1
it,	1
was	1
particularly	1
welcome.	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
would	1
have	1
persuaded	1
her,	1
at	1
its	1
conclusion,	1
to	1
take	1
some	1
rest	1
before	1
her	1
mother's	1
arrival,	1
and	1
allow	1
HER	1
to	1
take	1
her	1
place	1
by	1
Marianne;	1
but	1
Elinor	1
had	1
no	1
sense	1
of	1
fatigue,	1
no	1
capability	1
of	1
sleep	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
about	1
her,	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
kept	1
away	1
from	1
her	1
sister	1
an	1
unnecessary	1
instant.	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
therefore	1
attending	1
her	1
up	1
stairs	1
into	1
the	1
sick	1
chamber,	1
to	1
satisfy	1
herself	1
that	1
all	1
continued	1
right,	1
left	1
her	1
there	1
again	1
to	1
her	1
charge	1
and	1
her	1
thoughts,	1
and	1
retired	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
room	1
to	1
write	1
letters	1
and	1
sleep.	1
The	1
night	1
was	1
cold	1
and	1
stormy.	1
The	1
wind	1
roared	1
round	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
the	1
rain	1
beat	1
against	1
the	1
windows;	1
but	1
Elinor,	1
all	1
happiness	1
within,	1
regarded	1
it	1
not.	1
Marianne	1
slept	1
through	1
every	1
blast;	1
and	1
the	1
travellers--	1
they	1
had	1
a	1
rich	1
reward	1
in	1
store,	1
for	1
every	1
present	1
inconvenience.	1
The	1
clock	1
struck	1
eight.	1
Had	1
it	1
been	1
ten,	1
Elinor	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
convinced	1
that	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
she	1
heard	1
a	1
carriage	1
driving	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
house;	1
and	1
so	1
strong	1
was	1
the	1
persuasion	1
that	1
she	1
DID,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
ALMOST	1
impossibility	1
of	1
their	1
being	1
already	1
come,	1
that	1
she	1
moved	1
into	1
the	1
adjoining	1
dressing-closet	1
and	1
opened	1
a	1
window	1
shutter,	1
to	1
be	1
satisfied	1
of	1
the	1
truth.	1
She	1
instantly	1
saw	1
that	1
her	1
ears	1
had	1
not	1
deceived	1
her.	1
The	1
flaring	1
lamps	1
of	1
a	1
carriage	1
were	1
immediately	1
in	1
view.	1
By	1
their	1
uncertain	1
light	1
she	1
thought	1
she	1
could	1
discern	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
drawn	1
by	1
four	1
horses;	1
and	1
this,	1
while	1
it	1
told	1
the	1
excess	1
of	1
her	1
poor	1
mother's	1
alarm,	1
gave	1
some	1
explanation	1
to	1
such	1
unexpected	1
rapidity.	1
Never	1
in	1
her	1
life	1
had	1
Elinor	1
found	1
it	1
so	1
difficult	1
to	1
be	1
calm,	1
as	1
at	1
that	1
moment.	1
The	1
knowledge	1
of	1
what	1
her	1
mother	1
must	1
be	1
feeling	1
as	1
the	1
carriage	1
stopt	1
at	1
the	1
door--	1
of	1
her	1
doubt--her	1
dread--perhaps	1
her	1
despair!--and	1
of	1
what	1
SHE	1
had	1
to	1
tell!--with	1
such	1
knowledge	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
be	1
calm.	1
All	1
that	1
remained	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
speedy;	1
and,	1
therefore	1
staying	1
only	1
till	1
she	1
could	1
leave	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings's	1
maid	1
with	1
her	1
sister,	1
she	1
hurried	1
down	1
stairs.	1
The	1
bustle	1
in	1
the	1
vestibule,	1
as	1
she	1
passed	1
along	1
an	1
inner	1
lobby,	1
assured	1
her	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
already	1
in	1
the	1
house.	1
She	1
rushed	1
to	1
the	1
drawing-room,--she	1
entered	1
it,--and	1
saw	1
only	1
Willoughby.	1
CHAPTER	1
44	1
Elinor,	1
starting	1
back	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
horror	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
him,	1
obeyed	1
the	1
first	1
impulse	1
of	1
her	1
heart	1
in	1
turning	1
instantly	1
to	1
quit	1
the	1
room,	1
and	1
her	1
hand	1
was	1
already	1
on	1
the	1
lock,	1
when	1
its	1
action	1
was	1
suspended	1
by	1
his	1
hastily	1
advancing,	1
and	1
saying,	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
rather	1
of	1
command	1
than	1
supplication,	1
"Miss	1
Dashwood,	1
for	1
half	1
an	1
hour--for	1
ten	1
minutes--	1
I	1
entreat	1
you	1
to	1
stay."	1
"No,	1
sir,"	1
she	1
replied	1
with	1
firmness,	1
"I	1
shall	1
NOT	1
stay.	1
Your	1
business	1
cannot	1
be	1
with	1
ME.	1
The	1
servants,	1
I	1
suppose,	1
forgot	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
Mr.	1
Palmer	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
house."	1
"Had	1
they	1
told	1
me,"	1
he	1
cried	1
with	1
vehemence,	1
"that	1
Mr.	1
Palmer	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
relations	1
were	1
at	1
the	1
devil,	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
turned	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
door.	1
My	1
business	1
is	1
with	1
you,	1
and	1
only	1
you."	1
"With	1
me!"--in	1
the	1
utmost	1
amazement--"well,	1
sir,--	1
be	1
quick--and	1
if	1
you	1
can--less	1
violent."	1
"Sit	1
down,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
both."	1
She	1
hesitated;	1
she	1
knew	1
not	1
what	1
to	1
do.	1
The	1
possibility	1
of	1
Colonel	1
Brandon's	1
arriving	1
and	1
finding	1
her	1
there,	1
came	1
across	1
her.	1
But	1
she	1
had	1
promised	1
to	1
hear	1
him,	1
and	1
her	1
curiosity	1
no	1
less	1
than	1
her	1
honor	1
was	1
engaged.	1
After	1
a	1
moment's	1
recollection,	1
therefore,	1
concluding	1
that	1
prudence	1
required	1
dispatch,	1
and	1
that	1
her	1
acquiescence	1
would	1
best	1
promote	1
it,	1
she	1
walked	1
silently	1
towards	1
the	1
table,	1
and	1
sat	1
down.	1
He	1
took	1
the	1
opposite	1
chair,	1
and	1
for	1
half	1
a	1
minute	1
not	1
a	1
word	1
was	1
said	1
by	1
either.	1
"Pray	1
be	1
quick,	1
sir,"--said	1
Elinor,	1
impatiently;--	1
"I	1
have	1
no	1
time	1
to	1
spare."	1
He	1
was	1
sitting	1
in	1
an	1
attitude	1
of	1
deep	1
meditation,	1
and	1
seemed	1
not	1
to	1
hear	1
her.	1
"Your	1
sister,"	1
said	1
he,	1
with	1
abruptness,	1
a	1
moment	1
afterwards--"is	1
out	1
of	1
danger.	1
I	1
heard	1
it	1
from	1
the	1
servant.	1
God	1
be	1
praised!--But	1
is	1
it	1
true?	1
is	1
it	1
really	1
true?"	1
Elinor	1
would	1
not	1
speak.	1
He	1
repeated	1
the	1
inquiry	1
with	1
yet	1
greater	1
eagerness.	1
"For	1
God's	1
sake	1
tell	1
me,	1
is	1
she	1
out	1
of	1
danger,	1
or	1
is	1
she	1
not?"	1
"We	1
hope	1
she	1
is."	1
He	1
rose	1
up,	1
and	1
walked	1
across	1
the	1
room.	1
"Had	1
I	1
known	1
as	1
much	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
ago--But	1
since	1
I	1
AM	1
here,"--speaking	1
with	1
a	1
forced	1
vivacity	1
as	1
he	1
returned	1
to	1
his	1
seat--"what	1
does	1
it	1
signify?--For	1
once,	1
Miss	1
Dashwood--it	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
last	1
time,	1
perhaps--let	1
us	1
be	1
cheerful	1
together.--I	1
am	1
in	1
a	1
fine	1
mood	1
for	1
gaiety.--	1
Tell	1
me	1
honestly"--a	1
deeper	1
glow	1
overspreading	1
his	1
cheeks--	1
"do	1
you	1
think	1
me	1
most	1
a	1
knave	1
or	1
a	1
fool?"	1
Elinor	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
greater	1
astonishment	1
than	1
ever.	1
She	1
began	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
be	1
must	1
be	1
in	1
liquor;--the	1
strangeness	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
visit,	1
and	1
of	1
such	1
manners,	1
seemed	1
no	1
otherwise	1
intelligible;	1
and	1
with	1
this	1
impression	1
she	1
immediately	1
rose,	1
saying,	1
"Mr.	1
Willoughby,	1
I	1
advise	1
you	1
at	1
present	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
Combe--I	1
am	1
not	1
at	1
leisure	1
to	1
remain	1
with	1
you	1
longer.--	1
Whatever	1
your	1
business	1
may	1
be	1
with	1
me,	1
will	1
it	1
be	1
better	1
recollected	1
and	1
explained	1
to-morrow."	1
"I	1
understand	1
you,"	1
he	1
replied,	1
with	1
an	1
expressive	1
smile,	1
and	1
a	1
voice	1
perfectly	1
calm;	1
"yes,	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
drunk.--	1
A	1
pint	1
of	1
porter	1
with	1
my	1
cold	1
beef	1
at	1
Marlborough	1
was	1
enough	1
to	1
over-set	1
me."	1
"At	1
Marlborough!"--cried	1
Elinor,	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
at	1
a	1
loss	1
to	1
understand	1
what	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
at.	1
"Yes,--I	1
left	1
London	1
this	1
morning	1
at	1
eight	1
o'clock,	1
and	1
the	1
only	1
ten	1
minutes	1
I	1
have	1
spent	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
chaise	1
since	1
that	1
time	1
procured	1
me	1
a	1
nuncheon	1
at	1
Marlborough."	1
The	1
steadiness	1
of	1
his	1
manner,	1
and	1
the	1
intelligence	1
of	1
his	1
eye	1
as	1
he	1
spoke,	1
convincing	1
Elinor,	1
that	1
whatever	1
other	1
unpardonable	1
folly	1
might	1
bring	1
him	1
to	1
Cleveland,	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
brought	1
there	1
by	1
intoxication,	1
she	1
said,	1
after	1
a	1
moment's	1
recollection,	1
"Mr.	1
Willoughby,	1
you	1
OUGHT	1
to	1
feel,	1
and	1
I	1
certainly	1
DO--that	1
after	1
what	1
has	1
passed--your	1
coming	1
here	1
in	1
this	1
manner,	1
and	1
forcing	1
yourself	1
upon	1
my	1
notice,	1
requires	1
a	1
very	1
particular	1
excuse.--What	1
is	1
it,	1
that	1
you	1
mean	1
by	1
it?"--	1
"I	1
mean,"--said	1
he,	1
with	1
serious	1
energy--"if	1
I	1
can,	1
to	1
make	1
you	1
hate	1
me	1
one	1
degree	1
less	1
than	1
you	1
do	1
NOW.	1
I	1
mean	1
to	1
offer	1
some	1
kind	1
of	1
explanation,	1
some	1
kind	1
of	1
apology,	1
for	1
the	1
past;	1
to	1
open	1
my	1
whole	1
heart	1
to	1
you,	1
and	1
by	1
convincing	1
you,	1
that	1
though	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
always	1
a	1
blockhead,	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
been	1
always	1
a	1
rascal,	1
to	1
obtain	1
something	1
like	1
forgiveness	1
from	1
Ma--from	1
your	1
sister."	1
"Is	1
this	1
the	1
real	1
reason	1
of	1
your	1
coming?"	1
"Upon	1
my	1
soul	1
it	1
is,"--was	1
his	1
answer,	1
with	1
a	1
warmth	1
which	1
brought	1
all	1
the	1
former	1
Willoughby	1
to	1
her	1
remembrance,	1
and	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
herself	1
made	1
her	1
think	1
him	1
sincere.	1
"If	1
that	1
is	1
all,	1
you	1
may	1
be	1
satisfied	1
already,--	1
for	1
Marianne	1
DOES--she	1
has	1
LONG	1
forgiven	1
you."	1
"Has	1
she?"--he	1
cried,	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
eager	1
tone.--	1
"Then	1
she	1
has	1
forgiven	1
me	1
before	1
she	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
done	1
it.	1
But	1
she	1
shall	1
forgive	1
me	1
again,	1
and	1
on	1
more	1
reasonable	1
grounds.--NOW	1
will	1
you	1
listen	1
to	1
me?"	1
Elinor	1
bowed	1
her	1
assent.	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
know,"	1
said	1
he,	1
after	1
a	1
pause	1
of	1
expectation	1
on	1
her	1
side,	1
and	1
thoughtfulness	1
on	1
his	1
own,--"how	1
YOU	1
may	1
have	1
accounted	1
for	1
my	1
behaviour	1
to	1
your	1
sister,	1
or	1
what	1
diabolical	1
motive	1
you	1
may	1
have	1
imputed	1
to	1
me.--	1
Perhaps	1
you	1
will	1
hardly	1
think	1
the	1
better	1
of	1
me,--it	1
is	1
worth	1
the	1
trial	1
however,	1
and	1
you	1
shall	1
hear	1
every	1
thing.	1
When	1
I	1
first	1
became	1
intimate	1
in	1
your	1
family,	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
other	1
intention,	1
no	1
other	1
view	1
in	1
the	1
acquaintance	1
than	1
to	1
pass	1
my	1
time	1
pleasantly	1
while	1
I	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
remain	1
in	1
Devonshire,	1
more	1
pleasantly	1
than	1
I	1
had	1
ever	1
done	1
before.	1
Your	1
sister's	1
lovely	1
person	1
and	1
interesting	1
manners	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
please	1
me;	1
and	1
her	1
behaviour	1
to	1
me	1
almost	1
from	1
the	1
first,	1
was	1
of	1
a	1
kind--It	1
is	1
astonishing,	1
when	1
I	1
reflect	1
on	1
what	1
it	1
was,	1
and	1
what	1
SHE	1
was,	1
that	1
my	1
heart	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
so	1
insensible!	1
But	1
at	1
first	1
I	1
must	1
confess,	1
my	1
vanity	1
only	1
was	1
elevated	1
by	1
it.	1
Careless	1
of	1
her	1
happiness,	1
thinking	1
only	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
amusement,	1
giving	1
way	1
to	1
feelings	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
always	1
been	1
too	1
much	1
in	1
the	1
habit	1
of	1
indulging,	1
I	1
endeavoured,	1
by	1
every	1
means	1
in	1
my	1
power,	1
to	1
make	1
myself	1
pleasing	1
to	1
her,	1
without	1
any	1
design	1
of	1
returning	1
her	1
affection."	1
Miss	1
Dashwood,	1
at	1
this	1
point,	1
turning	1
her	1
eyes	1
on	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
most	1
angry	1
contempt,	1
stopped	1
him,	1
by	1
saying,	1
"It	1
is	1
hardly	1
worth	1
while,	1
Mr.	1
Willoughby,	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
relate,	1
or	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
listen	1
any	1
longer.	1
Such	1
a	1
beginning	1
as	1
this	1
cannot	1
be	1
followed	1
by	1
any	1
thing.--	1
Do	1
not	1
let	1
me	1
be	1
pained	1
by	1
hearing	1
any	1
thing	1
more	1
on	1
the	1
subject."	1
"I	1
insist	1
on	1
you	1
hearing	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
it,"	1
he	1
replied,	1
"My	1
fortune	1
was	1
never	1
large,	1
and	1
I	1
had	1
always	1
been	1
expensive,	1
always	1
in	1
the	1
habit	1
of	1
associating	1
with	1
people	1
of	1
better	1
income	1
than	1
myself.	1
Every	1
year	1
since	1
my	1
coming	1
of	1
age,	1
or	1
even	1
before,	1
I	1
believe,	1
had	1
added	1
to	1
my	1
debts;	1
and	1
though	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
my	1
old	1
cousin,	1
Mrs.	1
Smith,	1
was	1
to	1
set	1
me	1
free;	1
yet	1
that	1
event	1
being	1
uncertain,	1
and	1
possibly	1
far	1
distant,	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
my	1
intention	1
to	1
re-establish	1
my	1
circumstances	1
by	1
marrying	1
a	1
woman	1
of	1
fortune.	1
To	1
attach	1
myself	1
to	1
your	1
sister,	1
therefore,	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
thing	1
to	1
be	1
thought	1
of;--and	1
with	1
a	1
meanness,	1
selfishness,	1
cruelty--	1
which	1
no	1
indignant,	1
no	1
contemptuous	1
look,	1
even	1
of	1
yours,	1
Miss	1
Dashwood,	1
can	1
ever	1
reprobate	1
too	1
much--I	1
was	1
acting	1
in	1
this	1
manner,	1
trying	1
to	1
engage	1
her	1
regard,	1
without	1
a	1
thought	1
of	1
returning	1
it.--But	1
one	1
thing	1
may	1
be	1
said	1
for	1
me:	1
even	1
in	1
that	1
horrid	1
state	1
of	1
selfish	1
vanity,	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
the	1
extent	1
of	1
the	1
injury	1
I	1
meditated,	1
because	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
THEN	1
know	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
love.	1
But	1
have	1
I	1
ever	1
known	1
it?--Well	1
may	1
it	1
be	1
doubted;	1
for,	1
had	1
I	1
really	1
loved,	1
could	1
I	1
have	1
sacrificed	1
my	1
feelings	1
to	1
vanity,	1
to	1
avarice?--or,	1
what	1
is	1
more,	1
could	1
I	1
have	1
sacrificed	1
hers?--	1
But	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
it.	1
To	1
avoid	1
a	1
comparative	1
poverty,	1
which	1
her	1
affection	1
and	1
her	1
society	1
would	1
have	1
deprived	1
of	1
all	1
its	1
horrors,	1
I	1
have,	1
by	1
raising	1
myself	1
to	1
affluence,	1
lost	1
every	1
thing	1
that	1
could	1
make	1
it	1
a	1
blessing."	1
"You	1
did	1
then,"	1
said	1
Elinor,	1
a	1
little	1
softened,	1
"believe	1
yourself	1
at	1
one	1
time	1
attached	1
to	1
her?"	1
"To	1
have	1
resisted	1
such	1
attractions,	1
to	1
have	1
withstood	1
such	1
tenderness!--Is	1
there	1
a	1
man	1
on	1
earth	1
who	1
could	1
have	1
done	1
it?--Yes,	1
I	1
found	1
myself,	1
by	1
insensible	1
degrees,	1
sincerely	1
fond	1
of	1
her;	1
and	1
the	1
happiest	1
hours	1
of	1
my	1
life	1
were	1
what	1
I	1
spent	1
with	1
her	1
when	1
I	1
felt	1
my	1
intentions	1
were	1
strictly	1
honourable,	1
and	1
my	1
feelings	1
blameless.	1
Even	1
THEN,	1
however,	1
when	1
fully	1
determined	1
on	1
paying	1
my	1
addresses	1
to	1
her,	1
I	1
allowed	1
myself	1
most	1
improperly	1
to	1
put	1
off,	1
from	1
day	1
to	1
day,	1
the	1
moment	1
of	1
doing	1
it,	1
from	1
an	1
unwillingness	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
an	1
engagement	1
while	1
my	1
circumstances	1
were	1
so	1
greatly	1
embarrassed.	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
reason	1
here--nor	1
will	1
I	1
stop	1
for	1
YOU	1
to	1
expatiate	1
on	1
the	1
absurdity,	1
and	1
the	1
worse	1
than	1
absurdity,	1
of	1
scrupling	1
to	1
engage	1
my	1
faith	1
where	1
my	1
honour	1
was	1
already	1
bound.	1
The	1
event	1
has	1
proved,	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
cunning	1
fool,	1
providing	1
with	1
great	1
circumspection	1
for	1
a	1
possible	1
opportunity	1
of	1
making	1
myself	1
contemptible	1
and	1
wretched	1
for	1
ever.	1
At	1
last,	1
however,	1
my	1
resolution	1
was	1
taken,	1
and	1
I	1
had	1
determined,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
I	1
could	1
engage	1
her	1
alone,	1
to	1
justify	1
the	1
attentions	1
I	1
had	1
so	1
invariably	1
paid	1
her,	1
and	1
openly	1
assure	1
her	1
of	1
an	1
affection	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
already	1
taken	1
such	1
pains	1
to	1
display.	1
But	1
in	1
the	1
interim--in	1
the	1
interim	1
of	1
the	1
very	1
few	1
hours	1
that	1
were	1
to	1
pass,	1
before	1
I	1
could	1
have	1
an	1
opportunity	1
of	1
speaking	1
with	1
her	1
in	1
private--	1
a	1
circumstance	1
occurred--an	1
unlucky	1
circumstance,	1
to	1
ruin	1
all	1
my	1
resolution,	1
and	1
with	1
it	1
all	1
my	1
comfort.	1
A	1
discovery	1
took	1
place,"--here	1
he	1
hesitated	1
and	1
looked	1
down.--"Mrs.	1
Smith	1
had	1
somehow	1
or	1
other	1
been	1
informed,	1
I	1
imagine	1
by	1
some	1
distant	1
relation,	1
whose	1
interest	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
deprive	1
me	1
of	1
her	1
favour,	1
of	1
an	1
affair,	1
a	1
connection--but	1
I	1
need	1
not	1
explain	1
myself	1
farther,"	1
he	1
added,	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
with	1
an	1
heightened	1
colour	1
and	1
an	1
enquiring	1
eye--"your	1
particular	1
intimacy--you	1
have	1
probably	1
heard	1
the	1
whole	1
story	1
long	1
ago."	1
"I	1
have,"	1
returned	1
Elinor,	1
colouring	1
likewise,	1
and	1
hardening	1
her	1
heart	1
anew	1
against	1
any	1
compassion	1
for	1
him,	1
"I	1
have	1
heard	1
it	1
all.	1
And	1
how	1
you	1
will	1
explain	1
away	1
any	1
part	1
of	1
your	1
guilt	1
in	1
that	1
dreadful	1
business,	1
I	1
confess	1
is	1
beyond	1
my	1
comprehension."	1
"Remember,"	1
cried	1
Willoughby,	1
"from	1
whom	1
you	1
received	1
the	1
account.	1
Could	1
it	1
be	1
an	1
impartial	1
one?	1
I	1
acknowledge	1
that	1
her	1
situation	1
and	1
her	1
character	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
respected	1
by	1
me.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
mean	1
to	1
justify	1
myself,	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
cannot	1
leave	1
you	1
to	1
suppose	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
urge--that	1
because	1
she	1
was	1
injured	1
she	1
was	1
irreproachable,	1
and	1
because	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
libertine,	1
SHE	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
saint.	1
If	1
the	1
violence	1
of	1
her	1
passions,	1
the	1
weakness	1
of	1
her	1
understanding--I	1
do	1
not	1
mean,	1
however,	1
to	1
defend	1
myself.	1
Her	1
affection	1
for	1
me	1
deserved	1
better	1
treatment,	1
and	1
I	1
often,	1
with	1
great	1
self-reproach,	1
recall	1
the	1
tenderness	1
which,	1
for	1
a	1
very	1
short	1
time,	1
had	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
creating	1
any	1
return.	1
I	1
wish--I	1
heartily	1
wish	1
it	1
had	1
never	1
been.	1
But	1
I	1
have	1
injured	1
more	1
than	1
herself;	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
injured	1
one,	1
whose	1
affection	1
for	1
me--(may	1
I	1
say	1
it?)	1
was	1
scarcely	1
less	1
warm	1
than	1
hers;	1
and	1
whose	1
mind--Oh!	1
how	1
infinitely	1
superior!"--	1
"Your	1
indifference,	1
however,	1
towards	1
that	1
unfortunate	1
girl--I	1
must	1
say	1
it,	1
unpleasant	1
to	1
me	1
as	1
the	1
discussion	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
subject	1
may	1
well	1
be--your	1
indifference	1
is	1
no	1
apology	1
for	1
your	1
cruel	1
neglect	1
of	1
her.	1
Do	1
not	1
think	1
yourself	1
excused	1
by	1
any	1
weakness,	1
any	1
natural	1
defect	1
of	1
understanding	1
on	1
her	1
side,	1
in	1
the	1
wanton	1
cruelty	1
so	1
evident	1
on	1
yours.	1
You	1
must	1
have	1
known,	1
that	1
while	1
you	1
were	1
enjoying	1
yourself	1
in	1
Devonshire	1
pursuing	1
fresh	1
schemes,	1
always	1
gay,	1
always	1
happy,	1
she	1
was	1
reduced	1
to	1
the	1
extremest	1
indigence."	1
"But,	1
upon	1
my	1
soul,	1
I	1
did	1
NOT	1
know	1
it,"	1
he	1
warmly	1
replied;	1
"I	1
did	1
not	1
recollect	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
omitted	1
to	1
give	1
her	1
my	1
direction;	1
and	1
common	1
sense	1
might	1
have	1
told	1
her	1
how	1
to	1
find	1
it	1
out."	1
"Well,	1
sir,	1
and	1
what	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Smith?"	1
"She	1
taxed	1
me	1
with	1
the	1
offence	1
at	1
once,	1
and	1
my	1
confusion	1
may	1
be	1
guessed.	1
The	1
purity	1
of	1
her	1
life,	1
the	1
formality	1
of	1
her	1
notions,	1
her	1
ignorance	1
of	1
the	1
world--every	1
thing	1
was	1
against	1
me.	1
The	1
matter	1
itself	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
deny,	1
and	1
vain	1
was	1
every	1
endeavour	1
to	1
soften	1
it.	1
She	1
was	1
previously	1
disposed,	1
I	1
believe,	1
to	1
doubt	1
the	1
morality	1
of	1
my	1
conduct	1
in	1
general,	1
and	1
was	1
moreover	1
discontented	1
with	1
the	1
very	1
little	1
attention,	1
the	1
very	1
little	1
portion	1
of	1
my	1
time	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
bestowed	1
on	1
her,	1
in	1
my	1
present	1
visit.	1
In	1
short,	1
it	1
ended	1
in	1
a	1
total	1
breach.	1
By	1
one	1
measure	1
I	1
might	1
have	1
saved	1
myself.	1
In	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
her	1
morality,	1
good	1
woman!	1
she	1
offered	1
to	1
forgive	1
the	1
past,	1
if	1
I	1
would	1
marry	1
Eliza.	1
That	1
could	1
not	1
be--and	1
I	1
was	1
formally	1
dismissed	1
from	1
her	1
favour	1
and	1
her	1
house.	1
The	1
night	1
following	1
this	1
affair--I	1
was	1
to	1
go	1
the	1
next	1
morning--	1
was	1
spent	1
by	1
me	1
in	1
deliberating	1
on	1
what	1
my	1
future	1
conduct	1
should	1
be.	1
The	1
struggle	1
was	1
great--but	1
it	1
ended	1
too	1
soon.	1
My	1
affection	1
for	1
Marianne,	1
my	1
thorough	1
conviction	1
of	1
her	1
attachment	1
to	1
me--it	1
was	1
all	1
insufficient	1
to	1
outweigh	1
that	1
dread	1
of	1
poverty,	1
or	1
get	1
the	1
better	1
of	1
those	1
false	1
ideas	1
of	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
riches,	1
which	1
I	1
was	1
naturally	1
inclined	1
to	1
feel,	1
and	1
expensive	1
society	1
had	1
increased.	1
I	1
had	1
reason	1
to	1
believe	1
myself	1
secure	1
of	1
my	1
present	1
wife,	1
if	1
I	1
chose	1
to	1
address	1
her,	1
and	1
I	1
persuaded	1
myself	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
nothing	1
else	1
in	1
common	1
prudence	1
remained	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
do.	1
A	1
heavy	1
scene	1
however	1
awaited	1
me,	1
before	1
I	1
could	1
leave	1
Devonshire;--I	1
was	1
engaged	1
to	1
dine	1
with	1
you	1
on	1
that	1
very	1
day;	1
some	1
apology	1
was	1
therefore	1
necessary	1
for	1
my	1
breaking	1
this	1
engagement.	1
But	1
whether	1
I	1
should	1
write	1
this	1
apology,	1
or	1
deliver	1
it	1
in	1
person,	1
was	1
a	1
point	1
of	1
long	1
debate.	1
To	1
see	1
Marianne,	1
I	1
felt,	1
would	1
be	1
dreadful,	1
and	1
I	1
even	1
doubted	1
whether	1
I	1
could	1
see	1
her	1
again,	1
and	1
keep	1
to	1
my	1
resolution.	1
In	1
that	1
point,	1
however,	1
I	1
undervalued	1
my	1
own	1
magnanimity,	1
as	1
the	1
event	1
declared;	1
for	1
I	1
went,	1
I	1
saw	1
her,	1
and	1
saw	1
her	1
miserable,	1
and	1
left	1
her	1
miserable--and	1
left	1
her	1
hoping	1
never	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
again."	1
"Why	1
did	1
you	1
call,	1
Mr.	1
Willoughby?"	1
said	1
Elinor,	1
reproachfully;	1
"a	1
note	1
would	1
have	1
answered	1
every	1
purpose.--	1
Why	1
was	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
call?"	1
"It	1
was	1
necessary	1
to	1
my	1
own	1
pride.	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
bear	1
to	1
leave	1
the	1
country	1
in	1
a	1
manner	1
that	1
might	1
lead	1
you,	1
or	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
neighbourhood,	1
to	1
suspect	1
any	1
part	1
of	1
what	1
had	1
really	1
passed	1
between	1
Mrs.	1
Smith	1
and	1
myself--	1
and	1
I	1
resolved	1
therefore	1
on	1
calling	1
at	1
the	1
cottage,	1
in	1
my	1
way	1
to	1
Honiton.	1
The	1
sight	1
of	1
your	1
dear	1
sister,	1
however,	1
was	1
really	1
dreadful;	1
and,	1
to	1
heighten	1
the	1
matter,	1
I	1
found	1
her	1
alone.	1
You	1
were	1
all	1
gone	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
where.	1
I	1
had	1
left	1
her	1
only	1
the	1
evening	1
before,	1
so	1
fully,	1
so	1
firmly	1
resolved	1
within	1
my	1
self	1
on	1
doing	1
right!	1
A	1
few	1
hours	1
were	1
to	1
have	1
engaged	1
her	1
to	1
me	1
for	1
ever;	1
and	1
I	1
remember	1
how	1
happy,	1
how	1
gay	1
were	1
my	1
spirits,	1
as	1
I	1
walked	1
from	1
the	1
cottage	1
to	1
Allenham,	1
satisfied	1
with	1
myself,	1
delighted	1
with	1
every	1
body!	1
But	1
in	1
this,	1
our	1
last	1
interview	1
of	1
friendship,	1
I	1
approached	1
her	1
with	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
guilt	1
that	1
almost	1
took	1
from	1
me	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
dissembling.	1
Her	1
sorrow,	1
her	1
disappointment,	1
her	1
deep	1
regret,	1
when	1
I	1
told	1
her	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
leave	1
Devonshire	1
so	1
immediately--I	1
never	1
shall	1
forget	1
it--united	1
too	1
with	1
such	1
reliance,	1
such	1
confidence	1
in	1
me!--Oh,	1
God!--what	1
a	1
hard-hearted	1
rascal	1
I	1
was!"	1
They	1
were	1
both	1
silent	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
moments.	1
Elinor	1
first	1
spoke.	1
"Did	1
you	1
tell	1
her	1
that	1
you	1
should	1
soon	1
return?"	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
I	1
told	1
her,"	1
he	1
replied,	1
impatiently;	1
"less	1
than	1
was	1
due	1
to	1
the	1
past,	1
beyond	1
a	1
doubt,	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
likelihood	1
much	1
more	1
than	1
was	1
justified	1
by	1
the	1
future.	1
I	1
cannot	1
think	1
of	1
it.--It	1
won't	1
do.--Then	1
came	1
your	1
dear	1
mother	1
to	1
torture	1
me	1
farther,	1
with	1
all	1
her	1
kindness	1
and	1
confidence.	1
Thank	1
Heaven!	1
it	1
DID	1
torture	1
me.	1
I	1
was	1
miserable.	1
Miss	1
Dashwood,	1
you	1
cannot	1
have	1
an	1
idea	1
of	1
the	1
comfort	1
it	1
gives	1
me	1
to	1
look	1
back	1
on	1
my	1
own	1
misery.	1
I	1
owe	1
such	1
a	1
grudge	1
to	1
myself	1
for	1
the	1
stupid,	1
rascally	1
folly	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
heart,	1
that	1
all	1
my	1
past	1
sufferings	1
under	1
it	1
are	1
only	1
triumph	1
and	1
exultation	1
to	1
me	1
now.	1
Well,	1
I	1
went,	1
left	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
loved,	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
those	1
to	1
whom,	1
at	1
best,	1
I	1
was	1
only	1
indifferent.	1
My	1
journey	1
to	1
town--travelling	1
with	1
my	1
own	1
horses,	1
and	1
therefore	1
so	1
tediously--no	1
creature	1
to	1
speak	1
to--my	1
own	1
reflections	1
so	1
cheerful--when	1
I	1
looked	1
forward	1
every	1
thing	1
so	1
inviting!--when	1
I	1
looked	1
back	1
at	1
Barton,	1
the	1
picture	1
so	1
soothing!--oh,	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
blessed	1
journey!"	1
He	1
stopped.	1
"Well,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
Elinor,	1
who,	1
though	1
pitying	1
him,	1
grew	1
impatient	1
for	1
his	1
departure,	1
"and	1
this	1
is	1
all?"	1
"Ah!--no,--have	1
you	1
forgot	1
what	1
passed	1
in	1
town?--	1
That	1
infamous	1
letter--Did	1
she	1
shew	1
it	1
you?"	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
saw	1
every	1
note	1
that	1
passed."	1
"When	1
the	1
first	1
of	1
hers	1
reached	1
me	1
(as	1
it	1
immediately	1
did,	1
for	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
town	1
the	1
whole	1
time,)	1
what	1
I	1
felt	1
is--	1
in	1
the	1
common	1
phrase,	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
expressed;	1
in	1
a	1
more	1
simple	1
one--perhaps	1
too	1
simple	1
to	1
raise	1
any	1
emotion--	1
my	1
feelings	1
were	1
very,	1
very	1
painful.--Every	1
line,	1
every	1
word	1
was--in	1
the	1
hackneyed	1
metaphor	1
which	1
their	1
dear	1
writer,	1
were	1
she	1
here,	1
would	1
forbid--a	1
dagger	1
to	1
my	1
heart.	1
To	1
know	1
that	1
Marianne	1
was	1
in	1
town	1
was--in	1
the	1
same	1
language--	1
a	1
thunderbolt.--Thunderbolts	1
and	1
daggers!--what	1
a	1
reproof	1
would	1
she	1
have	1
given	1
me!--her	1
taste,	1
her	1
opinions--I	1
believe	1
they	1
are	1
better	1
known	1
to	1
me	1
than	1
my	1
own,--and	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
they	1
are	1
dearer."	1
Elinor's	1
heart,	1
which	1
had	1
undergone	1
many	1
changes	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
this	1
extraordinary	1
conversation,	1
was	1
now	1
softened	1
again;--yet	1
she	1
felt	1
it	1
her	1
duty	1
to	1
check	1
such	1
ideas	1
in	1
her	1
companion	1
as	1
the	1
last.	1
"This	1
is	1
not	1
right,	1
Mr.	1
Willoughby.--Remember	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
married.	1
Relate	1
only	1
what	1
in	1
your	1
conscience	1
you	1
think	1
necessary	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
hear."	1
"Marianne's	1
note,	1
by	1
assuring	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
still	1
as	1
dear	1
to	1
her	1
as	1
in	1
former	1
days,	1
that	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
many,	1
many	1
weeks	1
we	1
had	1
been	1
separated,	1
she	1
was	1
as	1
constant	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
feelings,	1
and	1
as	1
full	1
of	1
faith	1
in	1
the	1
constancy	1
of	1
mine	1
as	1
ever,	1
awakened	1
all	1
my	1
remorse.	1
I	1
say	1
awakened,	1
because	1
time	1
and	1
London,	1
business	1
and	1
dissipation,	1
had	1
in	1
some	1
measure	1
quieted	1
it,	1
and	1
I	1
had	1
been	1
growing	1
a	1
fine	1
hardened	1
villain,	1
fancying	1
myself	1
indifferent	1
to	1
her,	1
and	1
chusing	1
to	1
fancy	1
that	1
she	1
too	1
must	1
have	1
become	1
indifferent	1
to	1
me;	1
talking	1
to	1
myself	1
of	1
our	1
past	1
attachment	1
as	1
a	1
mere	1
idle,	1
trifling	1
business,	1
shrugging	1
up	1
my	1
shoulders	1
in	1
proof	1
of	1
its	1
being	1
so,	1
and	1
silencing	1
every	1
reproach,	1
overcoming	1
every	1
scruple,	1
by	1
secretly	1
saying	1
now	1
and	1
then,	1
'I	1
shall	1
be	1
heartily	1
glad	1
to	1
hear	1
she	1
is	1
well	1
married.'--	1
But	1
this	1
note	1
made	1
me	1
know	1
myself	1
better.	1
I	1
felt	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
infinitely	1
dearer	1
to	1
me	1
than	1
any	1
other	1
woman	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
using	1
her	1
infamously.	1
But	1
every	1
thing	1
was	1
then	1
just	1
settled	1
between	1
Miss	1
Grey	1
and	1
me.	1
To	1
retreat	1
was	1
impossible.	1
All	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
to	1
do,	1
was	1
to	1
avoid	1
you	1
both.	1
I	1
sent	1
no	1
answer	1
to	1
Marianne,	1
intending	1
by	1
that	1
to	1
preserve	1
myself	1
from	1
her	1
farther	1
notice;	1
and	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
I	1
was	1
even	1
determined	1
not	1
to	1
call	1
in	1
Berkeley	1
Street;--but	1
at	1
last,	1
judging	1
it	1
wiser	1
to	1
affect	1
the	1
air	1
of	1
a	1
cool,	1
common	1
acquaintance	1
than	1
anything	1
else,	1
I	1
watched	1
you	1
all	1
safely	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
one	1
morning,	1
and	1
left	1
my	1
name."	1
"Watched	1
us	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house!"	1
"Even	1
so.	1
You	1
would	1
be	1
surprised	1
to	1
hear	1
how	1
often	1
I	1
watched	1
you,	1
how	1
often	1
I	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
falling	1
in	1
with	1
you.	1
I	1
have	1
entered	1
many	1
a	1
shop	1
to	1
avoid	1
your	1
sight,	1
as	1
the	1
carriage	1
drove	1
by.	1
Lodging	1
as	1
I	1
did	1
in	1
Bond	1
Street,	1
there	1
was	1
hardly	1
a	1
day	1
in	1
which	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
catch	1
a	1
glimpse	1
of	1
one	1
or	1
other	1
of	1
you;	1
and	1
nothing	1
but	1
the	1
most	1
constant	1
watchfulness	1
on	1
my	1
side,	1
a	1
most	1
invariably	1
prevailing	1
desire	1
to	1
keep	1
out	1
of	1
your	1
sight,	1
could	1
have	1
separated	1
us	1
so	1
long.	1
I	1
avoided	1
the	1
Middletons	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
possible,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
everybody	1
else	1
who	1
was	1
likely	1
to	1
prove	1
an	1
acquaintance	1
in	1
common.	1
Not	1
aware	1
of	1
their	1
being	1
in	1
town,	1
however,	1
I	1
blundered	1
on	1
Sir	1
John,	1
I	1
believe,	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
of	1
his	1
coming,	1
and	1
the	1
day	1
after	1
I	1
had	1
called	1
at	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings's.	1
He	1
asked	1
me	1
to	1
a	1
party,	1
a	1
dance	1
at	1
his	1
house	1
in	1
the	1
evening.--Had	1
he	1
NOT	1
told	1
me	1
as	1
an	1
inducement	1
that	1
you	1
and	1
your	1
sister	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
there,	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
felt	1
it	1
too	1
certain	1
a	1
thing,	1
to	1
trust	1
myself	1
near	1
him.	1
The	1
next	1
morning	1
brought	1
another	1
short	1
note	1
from	1
Marianne--	1
still	1
affectionate,	1
open,	1
artless,	1
confiding--everything	1
that	1
could	1
make	1
MY	1
conduct	1
most	1
hateful.	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
answer	1
it.	1
I	1
tried--but	1
could	1
not	1
frame	1
a	1
sentence.	1
But	1
I	1
thought	1
of	1
her,	1
I	1
believe,	1
every	1
moment	1
of	1
the	1
day.	1
If	1
you	1
CAN	1
pity	1
me,	1
Miss	1
Dashwood,	1
pity	1
my	1
situation	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
THEN.	1
With	1
my	1
head	1
and	1
heart	1
full	1
of	1
your	1
sister,	1
I	1
was	1
forced	1
to	1
play	1
the	1
happy	1
lover	1
to	1
another	1
woman!--Those	1
three	1
or	1
four	1
weeks	1
were	1
worse	1
than	1
all.	1
Well,	1
at	1
last,	1
as	1
I	1
need	1
not	1
tell	1
you,	1
you	1
were	1
forced	1
on	1
me;	1
and	1
what	1
a	1
sweet	1
figure	1
I	1
cut!--what	1
an	1
evening	1
of	1
agony	1
it	1
was!--	1
Marianne,	1
beautiful	1
as	1
an	1
angel	1
on	1
one	1
side,	1
calling	1
me	1
Willoughby	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
tone!--Oh,	1
God!--holding	1
out	1
her	1
hand	1
to	1
me,	1
asking	1
me	1
for	1
an	1
explanation,	1
with	1
those	1
bewitching	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
in	1
such	1
speaking	1
solicitude	1
on	1
my	1
face!--and	1
Sophia,	1
jealous	1
as	1
the	1
devil	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
hand,	1
looking	1
all	1
that	1
was--Well,	1
it	1
does	1
not	1
signify;	1
it	1
is	1
over	1
now.--	1
Such	1
an	1
evening!--I	1
ran	1
away	1
from	1
you	1
all	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
I	1
could;	1
but	1
not	1
before	1
I	1
had	1
seen	1
Marianne's	1
sweet	1
face	1
as	1
white	1
as	1
death.--THAT	1
was	1
the	1
last,	1
last	1
look	1
I	1
ever	1
had	1
of	1
her;--	1
the	1
last	1
manner	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
appeared	1
to	1
me.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
horrid	1
sight!--yet	1
when	1
I	1
thought	1
of	1
her	1
to-day	1
as	1
really	1
dying,	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
comfort	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
imagine	1
that	1
I	1
knew	1
exactly	1
how	1
she	1
would	1
appear	1
to	1
those,	1
who	1
saw	1
her	1
last	1
in	1
this	1
world.	1
She	1
was	1
before	1
me,	1
constantly	1
before	1
me,	1
as	1
I	1
travelled,	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
look	1
and	1
hue."	1
A	1
short	1
pause	1
of	1
mutual	1
thoughtfulness	1
succeeded.	1
Willoughby	1
first	1
rousing	1
himself,	1
broke	1
it	1
thus:	1
"Well,	1
let	1
me	1
make	1
haste	1
and	1
be	1
gone.	1
Your	1
sister	1
is	1
certainly	1
better,	1
certainly	1
out	1
of	1
danger?"	1
"We	1
are	1
assured	1
of	1
it."	1
"Your	1
poor	1
mother,	1
too!--doting	1
on	1
Marianne."	1
"But	1
the	1
letter,	1
Mr.	1
Willoughby,	1
your	1
own	1
letter;	1
have	1
you	1
any	1
thing	1
to	1
say	1
about	1
that?"	1
"Yes,	1
yes,	1
THAT	1
in	1
particular.	1
Your	1
sister	1
wrote	1
to	1
me	1
again,	1
you	1
know,	1
the	1
very	1
next	1
morning.	1
You	1
saw	1
what	1
she	1
said.	1
I	1
was	1
breakfasting	1
at	1
the	1
Ellisons,--and	1
her	1
letter,	1
with	1
some	1
others,	1
was	1
brought	1
to	1
me	1
there	1
from	1
my	1
lodgings.	1
It	1
happened	1
to	1
catch	1
Sophia's	1
eye	1
before	1
it	1
caught	1
mine--and	1
its	1
size,	1
the	1
elegance	1
of	1
the	1
paper,	1
the	1
hand-writing	1
altogether,	1
immediately	1
gave	1
her	1
a	1
suspicion.	1
Some	1
vague	1
report	1
had	1
reached	1
her	1
before	1
of	1
my	1
attachment	1
to	1
some	1
young	1
lady	1
in	1
Devonshire,	1
and	1
what	1
had	1
passed	1
within	1
her	1
observation	1
the	1
preceding	1
evening	1
had	1
marked	1
who	1
the	1
young	1
lady	1
was,	1
and	1
made	1
her	1
more	1
jealous	1
than	1
ever.	1
Affecting	1
that	1
air	1
of	1
playfulness,	1
therefore,	1
which	1
is	1
delightful	1
in	1
a	1
woman	1
one	1
loves,	1
she	1
opened	1
the	1
letter	1
directly,	1
and	1
read	1
its	1
contents.	1
She	1
was	1
well	1
paid	1
for	1
her	1
impudence.	1
She	1
read	1
what	1
made	1
her	1
wretched.	1
Her	1
wretchedness	1
I	1
could	1
have	1
borne,	1
but	1
her	1
passion--her	1
malice--At	1
all	1
events	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
appeased.	1
And,	1
in	1
short--what	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
of	1
my	1
wife's	1
style	1
of	1
letter-writing?--delicate--tender--	1
truly	1
feminine--was	1
it	1
not?"	1
"Your	1
wife!--The	1
letter	1
was	1
in	1
your	1
own	1
hand-writing."	1
"Yes,	1
but	1
I	1
had	1
only	1
the	1
credit	1
of	1
servilely	1
copying	1
such	1
sentences	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
ashamed	1
to	1
put	1
my	1
name	1
to.	1
The	1
original	1
was	1
all	1
her	1
own--her	1
own	1
happy	1
thoughts	1
and	1
gentle	1
diction.	1
But	1
what	1
could	1
I	1
do!--we	1
were	1
engaged,	1
every	1
thing	1
in	1
preparation,	1
the	1
day	1
almost	1
fixed--But	1
I	1
am	1
talking	1
like	1
a	1
fool.	1
Preparation!--day!--In	1
honest	1
words,	1
her	1
money	1
was	1
necessary	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
situation	1
like	1
mine,	1
any	1
thing	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
to	1
prevent	1
a	1
rupture.	1
And	1
after	1
all,	1
what	1
did	1
it	1
signify	1
to	1
my	1
character	1
in	1
the	1
opinion	1
of	1
Marianne	1
and	1
her	1
friends,	1
in	1
what	1
language	1
my	1
answer	1
was	1
couched?--It	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
only	1
to	1
one	1
end.	1
My	1
business	1
was	1
to	1
declare	1
myself	1
a	1
scoundrel,	1
and	1
whether	1
I	1
did	1
it	1
with	1
a	1
bow	1
or	1
a	1
bluster	1
was	1
of	1
little	1
importance.--	1
'I	1
am	1
ruined	1
for	1
ever	1
in	1
their	1
opinion--'	1
said	1
I	1
to	1
myself--'I	1
am	1
shut	1
out	1
for	1
ever	1
from	1
their	1
society,	1
they	1
already	1
think	1
me	1
an	1
unprincipled	1
fellow,	1
this	1
letter	1
will	1
only	1
make	1
them	1
think	1
me	1
a	1
blackguard	1
one.'	1
Such	1
were	1
my	1
reasonings,	1
as,	1
in	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
desperate	1
carelessness,	1
I	1
copied	1
my	1
wife's	1
words,	1
and	1
parted	1
with	1
the	1
last	1
relics	1
of	1
Marianne.	1
Her	1
three	1
notes--unluckily	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
in	1
my	1
pocketbook,	1
or	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
denied	1
their	1
existence,	1
and	1
hoarded	1
them	1
for	1
ever--I	1
was	1
forced	1
to	1
put	1
them	1
up,	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
even	1
kiss	1
them.	1
And	1
the	1
lock	1
of	1
hair--that	1
too	1
I	1
had	1
always	1
carried	1
about	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
pocket-book,	1
which	1
was	1
now	1
searched	1
by	1
Madam	1
with	1
the	1
most	1
ingratiating	1
virulence,--the	1
dear	1
lock--all,	1
every	1
memento	1
was	1
torn	1
from	1
me."	1
"You	1
are	1
very	1
wrong,	1
Mr.	1
Willoughby,	1
very	1
blamable,"	1
said	1
Elinor,	1
while	1
her	1
voice,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
herself,	1
betrayed	1
her	1
compassionate	1
emotion;	1
"you	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
speak	1
in	1
this	1
way,	1
either	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
Willoughby	1
or	1
my	1
sister.	1
You	1
had	1
made	1
your	1
own	1
choice.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
forced	1
on	1
you.	1
Your	1
wife	1
has	1
a	1
claim	1
to	1
your	1
politeness,	1
to	1
your	1
respect,	1
at	1
least.	1
She	1
must	1
be	1
attached	1
to	1
you,	1
or	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
married	1
you.	1
To	1
treat	1
her	1
with	1
unkindness,	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
her	1
slightingly	1
is	1
no	1
atonement	1
to	1
Marianne--nor	1
can	1
I	1
suppose	1
it	1
a	1
relief	1
to	1
your	1
own	1
conscience."	1
"Do	1
not	1
talk	1
to	1
me	1
of	1
my	1
wife,"	1
said	1
he	1
with	1
a	1
heavy	1
sigh.--	1
"She	1
does	1
not	1
deserve	1
your	1
compassion.--She	1
knew	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
regard	1
for	1
her	1
when	1
we	1
married.--Well,	1
married	1
we	1
were,	1
and	1
came	1
down	1
to	1
Combe	1
Magna	1
to	1
be	1
happy,	1
and	1
afterwards	1
returned	1
to	1
town	1
to	1
be	1
gay.--And	1
now	1
do	1
you	1
pity	1
me,	1
Miss	1
Dashwood?--or	1
have	1
I	1
said	1
all	1
this	1
to	1
no	1
purpose?--	1
Am	1
I--be	1
it	1
only	1
one	1
degree--am	1
I	1
less	1
guilty	1
in	1
your	1
opinion	1
than	1
I	1
was	1
before?--My	1
intentions	1
were	1
not	1
always	1
wrong.	1
Have	1
I	1
explained	1
away	1
any	1
part	1
of	1
my	1
guilt?"	1
"Yes,	1
you	1
have	1
certainly	1
removed	1
something--a	1
little.--	1
You	1
have	1
proved	1
yourself,	1
on	1
the	1
whole,	1
less	1
faulty	1
than	1
I	1
had	1
believed	1
you.	1
You	1
have	1
proved	1
your	1
heart	1
less	1
wicked,	1
much	1
less	1
wicked.	1
But	1
I	1
hardly	1
know--the	1
misery	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
inflicted--I	1
hardly	1
know	1
what	1
could	1
have	1
made	1
it	1
worse."	1
"Will	1
you	1
repeat	1
to	1
your	1
sister	1
when	1
she	1
is	1
recovered,	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
telling	1
you?--Let	1
me	1
be	1
a	1
little	1
lightened	1
too	1
in	1
her	1
opinion	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
in	1
yours.	1
You	1
tell	1
me	1
that	1
she	1
has	1
forgiven	1
me	1
already.	1
Let	1
me	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
fancy	1
that	1
a	1
better	1
knowledge	1
of	1
my	1
heart,	1
and	1
of	1
my	1
present	1
feelings,	1
will	1
draw	1
from	1
her	1
a	1
more	1
spontaneous,	1
more	1
natural,	1
more	1
gentle,	1
less	1
dignified,	1
forgiveness.	1
Tell	1
her	1
of	1
my	1
misery	1
and	1
my	1
penitence--tell	1
her	1
that	1
my	1
heart	1
was	1
never	1
inconstant	1
to	1
her,	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
will,	1
that	1
at	1
this	1
moment	1
she	1
is	1
dearer	1
to	1
me	1
than	1
ever."	1
"I	1
will	1
tell	1
her	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
necessary	1
to	1
what	1
may	1
comparatively	1
be	1
called,	1
your	1
justification.	1
But	1
you	1
have	1
not	1
explained	1
to	1
me	1
the	1
particular	1
reason	1
of	1
your	1
coming	1
now,	1
nor	1
how	1
you	1
heard	1
of	1
her	1
illness."	1
"Last	1
night,	1
in	1
Drury	1
Lane	1
lobby,	1
I	1
ran	1
against	1
Sir	1
John	1
Middleton,	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
who	1
I	1
was--for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
these	1
two	1
months--he	1
spoke	1
to	1
me.--That	1
he	1
had	1
cut	1
me	1
ever	1
since	1
my	1
marriage,	1
I	1
had	1
seen	1
without	1
surprise	1
or	1
resentment.	1
Now,	1
however,	1
his	1
good-natured,	1
honest,	1
stupid	1
soul,	1
full	1
of	1
indignation	1
against	1
me,	1
and	1
concern	1
for	1
your	1
sister,	1
could	1
not	1
resist	1
the	1
temptation	1
of	1
telling	1
me	1
what	1
he	1
knew	1
ought	1
to--though	1
probably	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
it	1
WOULD--vex	1
me	1
horridly.	1
As	1
bluntly	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
speak	1
it,	1
therefore,	1
he	1
told	1
me	1
that	1
Marianne	1
Dashwood	1
was	1
dying	1
of	1
a	1
putrid	1
fever	1
at	1
Cleveland--a	1
letter	1
that	1
morning	1
received	1
from	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
declared	1
her	1
danger	1
most	1
imminent--the	1
Palmers	1
are	1
all	1
gone	1
off	1
in	1
a	1
fright,	1
&c.--I	1
was	1
too	1
much	1
shocked	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
pass	1
myself	1
off	1
as	1
insensible	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
undiscerning	1
Sir	1
John.	1
His	1
heart	1
was	1
softened	1
in	1
seeing	1
mine	1
suffer;	1
and	1
so	1
much	1
of	1
his	1
ill-will	1
was	1
done	1
away,	1
that	1
when	1
we	1
parted,	1
he	1
almost	1
shook	1
me	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
while	1
he	1
reminded	1
me	1
of	1
an	1
old	1
promise	1
about	1
a	1
pointer	1
puppy.	1
What	1
I	1
felt	1
on	1
hearing	1
that	1
your	1
sister	1
was	1
dying--and	1
dying	1
too,	1
believing	1
me	1
the	1
greatest	1
villain	1
upon	1
earth,	1
scorning,	1
hating	1
me	1
in	1
her	1
latest	1
moments--for	1
how	1
could	1
I	1
tell	1
what	1
horrid	1
projects	1
might	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
imputed?	1
ONE	1
person	1
I	1
was	1
sure	1
would	1
represent	1
me	1
as	1
capable	1
of	1
any	1
thing--	1
What	1
I	1
felt	1
was	1
dreadful!--My	1
resolution	1
was	1
soon	1
made,	1
and	1
at	1
eight	1
o'clock	1
this	1
morning	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
my	1
carriage.	1
Now	1
you	1
know	1
all."	1
Elinor	1
made	1
no	1
answer.	1
Her	1
thoughts	1
were	1
silently	1
fixed	1
on	1
the	1
irreparable	1
injury	1
which	1
too	1
early	1
an	1
independence	1
and	1
its	1
consequent	1
habits	1
of	1
idleness,	1
dissipation,	1
and	1
luxury,	1
had	1
made	1
in	1
the	1
mind,	1
the	1
character,	1
the	1
happiness,	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
who,	1
to	1
every	1
advantage	1
of	1
person	1
and	1
talents,	1
united	1
a	1
disposition	1
naturally	1
open	1
and	1
honest,	1
and	1
a	1
feeling,	1
affectionate	1
temper.	1
The	1
world	1
had	1
made	1
him	1
extravagant	1
and	1
vain--Extravagance	1
and	1
vanity	1
had	1
made	1
him	1
cold-hearted	1
and	1
selfish.	1
Vanity,	1
while	1
seeking	1
its	1
own	1
guilty	1
triumph	1
at	1
the	1
expense	1
of	1
another,	1
had	1
involved	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
real	1
attachment,	1
which	1
extravagance,	1
or	1
at	1
least	1
its	1
offspring,	1
necessity,	1
had	1
required	1
to	1
be	1
sacrificed.	1
Each	1
faulty	1
propensity	1
in	1
leading	1
him	1
to	1
evil,	1
had	1
led	1
him	1
likewise	1
to	1
punishment.	1
The	1
attachment,	1
from	1
which	1
against	1
honour,	1
against	1
feeling,	1
against	1
every	1
better	1
interest	1
he	1
had	1
outwardly	1
torn	1
himself,	1
now,	1
when	1
no	1
longer	1
allowable,	1
governed	1
every	1
thought;	1
and	1
the	1
connection,	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
had,	1
with	1
little	1
scruple,	1
left	1
her	1
sister	1
to	1
misery,	1
was	1
likely	1
to	1
prove	1
a	1
source	1
of	1
unhappiness	1
to	1
himself	1
of	1
a	1
far	1
more	1
incurable	1
nature.	1
From	1
a	1
reverie	1
of	1
this	1
kind	1
she	1
was	1
recalled	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
some	1
minutes	1
by	1
Willoughby,	1
who,	1
rousing	1
himself	1
from	1
a	1
reverie	1
at	1
least	1
equally	1
painful,	1
started	1
up	1
in	1
preparation	1
for	1
going,	1
and	1
said--	1
"There	1
is	1
no	1
use	1
in	1
staying	1
here;	1
I	1
must	1
be	1
off."	1
"Are	1
you	1
going	1
back	1
to	1
town?"	1
"No--to	1
Combe	1
Magna.	1
I	1
have	1
business	1
there;	1
from	1
thence	1
to	1
town	1
in	1
a	1
day	1
or	1
two.	1
Good	1
bye."	1
He	1
held	1
out	1
his	1
hand.	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
refuse	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
hers's;--he	1
pressed	1
it	1
with	1
affection.	1
"And	1
you	1
DO	1
think	1
something	1
better	1
of	1
me	1
than	1
you	1
did?"--said	1
he,	1
letting	1
it	1
fall,	1
and	1
leaning	1
against	1
the	1
mantel-piece	1
as	1
if	1
forgetting	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
go.	1
Elinor	1
assured	1
him	1
that	1
she	1
did;--that	1
she	1
forgave,	1
pitied,	1
wished	1
him	1
well--was	1
even	1
interested	1
in	1
his	1
happiness--and	1
added	1
some	1
gentle	1
counsel	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
behaviour	1
most	1
likely	1
to	1
promote	1
it.	1
His	1
answer	1
was	1
not	1
very	1
encouraging.	1
"As	1
to	1
that,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"I	1
must	1
rub	1
through	1
the	1
world	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
I	1
can.	1
Domestic	1
happiness	1
is	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
question.	1
If,	1
however,	1
I	1
am	1
allowed	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
you	1
and	1
yours	1
feel	1
an	1
interest	1
in	1
my	1
fate	1
and	1
actions,	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
the	1
means--it	1
may	1
put	1
me	1
on	1
my	1
guard--at	1
least,	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
something	1
to	1
live	1
for.	1
Marianne	1
to	1
be	1
sure	1
is	1
lost	1
to	1
me	1
for	1
ever.	1
Were	1
I	1
even	1
by	1
any	1
blessed	1
chance	1
at	1
liberty	1
again--"	1
Elinor	1
stopped	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
reproof.	1
"Well,"--he	1
replied--"once	1
more	1
good	1
bye.	1
I	1
shall	1
now	1
go	1
away	1
and	1
live	1
in	1
dread	1
of	1
one	1
event."	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
mean?"	1
"Your	1
sister's	1
marriage."	1
"You	1
are	1
very	1
wrong.	1
She	1
can	1
never	1
be	1
more	1
lost	1
to	1
you	1
than	1
she	1
is	1
now."	1
"But	1
she	1
will	1
be	1
gained	1
by	1
some	1
one	1
else.	1
And	1
if	1
that	1
some	1
one	1
should	1
be	1
the	1
very	1
he	1
whom,	1
of	1
all	1
others,	1
I	1
could	1
least	1
bear--but	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
stay	1
to	1
rob	1
myself	1
of	1
all	1
your	1
compassionate	1
goodwill,	1
by	1
shewing	1
that	1
where	1
I	1
have	1
most	1
injured	1
I	1
can	1
least	1
forgive.	1
Good	1
bye,--God	1
bless	1
you!"	1
And	1
with	1
these	1
words,	1
he	1
almost	1
ran	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room.	1
CHAPTER	1
45	1
Elinor,	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
after	1
he	1
left	1
her,	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
even	1
after	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
his	1
carriage	1
had	1
died	1
away,	1
remained	1
too	1
much	1
oppressed	1
by	1
a	1
crowd	1
of	1
ideas,	1
widely	1
differing	1
in	1
themselves,	1
but	1
of	1
which	1
sadness	1
was	1
the	1
general	1
result,	1
to	1
think	1
even	1
of	1
her	1
sister.	1
Willoughby,	1
he,	1
whom	1
only	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
ago	1
she	1
had	1
abhorred	1
as	1
the	1
most	1
worthless	1
of	1
men,	1
Willoughby,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
faults,	1
excited	1
a	1
degree	1
of	1
commiseration	1
for	1
the	1
sufferings	1
produced	1
by	1
them,	1
which	1
made	1
her	1
think	1
of	1
him	1
as	1
now	1
separated	1
for	1
ever	1
from	1
her	1
family,	1
with	1
a	1
tenderness,	1
a	1
regret,	1
rather	1
in	1
proportion,	1
as	1
she	1
soon	1
acknowledged	1
within	1
herself--to	1
his	1
wishes	1
than	1
to	1
his	1
merits.	1
She	1
felt	1
that	1
his	1
influence	1
over	1
her	1
mind	1
was	1
heightened	1
by	1
circumstances	1
which	1
ought	1
not	1
in	1
reason	1
to	1
have	1
weight;	1
by	1
that	1
person	1
of	1
uncommon	1
attraction,	1
that	1
open,	1
affectionate,	1
and	1
lively	1
manner	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
no	1
merit	1
to	1
possess;	1
and	1
by	1
that	1
still	1
ardent	1
love	1
for	1
Marianne,	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
even	1
innocent	1
to	1
indulge.	1
But	1
she	1
felt	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
so,	1
long,	1
long	1
before	1
she	1
could	1
feel	1
his	1
influence	1
less.	1
When	1
at	1
last	1
she	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
unconscious	1
Marianne,	1
she	1
found	1
her	1
just	1
awaking,	1
refreshed	1
by	1
so	1
long	1
and	1
sweet	1
a	1
sleep	1
to	1
the	1
extent	1
of	1
her	1
hopes.	1
Elinor's	1
heart	1
was	1
full.	1
The	1
past,	1
the	1
present,	1
the	1
future,	1
Willoughby's	1
visit,	1
Marianne's	1
safety,	1
and	1
her	1
mother's	1
expected	1
arrival,	1
threw	1
her	1
altogether	1
into	1
an	1
agitation	1
of	1
spirits	1
which	1
kept	1
off	1
every	1
indication	1
of	1
fatigue,	1
and	1
made	1
her	1
only	1
fearful	1
of	1
betraying	1
herself	1
to	1
her	1
sister.	1
Short	1
was	1
the	1
time,	1
however,	1
in	1
which	1
that	1
fear	1
could	1
affect	1
her,	1
for	1
within	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
after	1
Willoughby's	1
leaving	1
the	1
house,	1
she	1
was	1
again	1
called	1
down	1
stairs	1
by	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
another	1
carriage.--Eager	1
to	1
save	1
her	1
mother	1
from	1
every	1
unnecessary	1
moment's	1
horrible	1
suspense,	1
she	1
ran	1
immediately	1
into	1
the	1
hall,	1
and	1
reached	1
the	1
outward	1
door	1
just	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
receive	1
and	1
support	1
her	1
as	1
she	1
entered	1
it.	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood,	1
whose	1
terror	1
as	1
they	1
drew	1
near	1
the	1
house	1
had	1
produced	1
almost	1
the	1
conviction	1
of	1
Marianne's	1
being	1
no	1
more,	1
had	1
no	1
voice	1
to	1
inquire	1
after	1
her,	1
no	1
voice	1
even	1
for	1
Elinor;	1
but	1
SHE,	1
waiting	1
neither	1
for	1
salutation	1
nor	1
inquiry,	1
instantly	1
gave	1
the	1
joyful	1
relief;--	1
and	1
her	1
mother,	1
catching	1
it	1
with	1
all	1
her	1
usual	1
warmth,	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
moment	1
as	1
much	1
overcome	1
by	1
her	1
happiness,	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
before	1
by	1
her	1
fears.	1
She	1
was	1
supported	1
into	1
the	1
drawing-room	1
between	1
her	1
daughter	1
and	1
her	1
friend;--	1
and	1
there,	1
shedding	1
tears	1
of	1
joy,	1
though	1
still	1
unable	1
to	1
speak,	1
embraced	1
Elinor	1
again	1
and	1
again,	1
turning	1
from	1
her	1
at	1
intervals	1
to	1
press	1
Colonel	1
Brandon's	1
hand,	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
which	1
spoke	1
at	1
once	1
her	1
gratitude,	1
and	1
her	1
conviction	1
of	1
his	1
sharing	1
with	1
herself	1
in	1
the	1
bliss	1
of	1
the	1
moment.	1
He	1
shared	1
it,	1
however,	1
in	1
a	1
silence	1
even	1
greater	1
than	1
her	1
own.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood	1
had	1
recovered	1
herself,	1
to	1
see	1
Marianne	1
was	1
her	1
first	1
desire;	1
and	1
in	1
two	1
minutes	1
she	1
was	1
with	1
her	1
beloved	1
child,	1
rendered	1
dearer	1
to	1
her	1
than	1
ever	1
by	1
absence,	1
unhappiness,	1
and	1
danger.	1
Elinor's	1
delight,	1
as	1
she	1
saw	1
what	1
each	1
felt	1
in	1
the	1
meeting,	1
was	1
only	1
checked	1
by	1
an	1
apprehension	1
of	1
its	1
robbing	1
Marianne	1
of	1
farther	1
sleep;--	1
but	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood	1
could	1
be	1
calm,	1
could	1
be	1
even	1
prudent,	1
when	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
a	1
child	1
was	1
at	1
stake,	1
and	1
Marianne,	1
satisfied	1
in	1
knowing	1
her	1
mother	1
was	1
near	1
her,	1
and	1
conscious	1
of	1
being	1
too	1
weak	1
for	1
conversation,	1
submitted	1
readily	1
to	1
the	1
silence	1
and	1
quiet	1
prescribed	1
by	1
every	1
nurse	1
around	1
her.	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood	1
WOULD	1
sit	1
up	1
with	1
her	1
all	1
night;	1
and	1
Elinor,	1
in	1
compliance	1
with	1
her	1
mother's	1
entreaty,	1
went	1
to	1
bed.	1
But	1
the	1
rest,	1
which	1
one	1
night	1
entirely	1
sleepless,	1
and	1
many	1
hours	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
wearing	1
anxiety	1
seemed	1
to	1
make	1
requisite,	1
was	1
kept	1
off	1
by	1
irritation	1
of	1
spirits.	1
Willoughby,	1
"poor	1
Willoughby,"	1
as	1
she	1
now	1
allowed	1
herself	1
to	1
call	1
him,	1
was	1
constantly	1
in	1
her	1
thoughts;	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
but	1
have	1
heard	1
his	1
vindication	1
for	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
now	1
blamed,	1
now	1
acquitted	1
herself	1
for	1
having	1
judged	1
him	1
so	1
harshly	1
before.	1
But	1
her	1
promise	1
of	1
relating	1
it	1
to	1
her	1
sister	1
was	1
invariably	1
painful.	1
She	1
dreaded	1
the	1
performance	1
of	1
it,	1
dreaded	1
what	1
its	1
effect	1
on	1
Marianne	1
might	1
be;	1
doubted	1
whether	1
after	1
such	1
an	1
explanation	1
she	1
could	1
ever	1
be	1
happy	1
with	1
another;	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
wished	1
Willoughby	1
a	1
widower.	1
Then,	1
remembering	1
Colonel	1
Brandon,	1
reproved	1
herself,	1
felt	1
that	1
to	1
HIS	1
sufferings	1
and	1
his	1
constancy	1
far	1
more	1
than	1
to	1
his	1
rival's,	1
the	1
reward	1
of	1
her	1
sister	1
was	1
due,	1
and	1
wished	1
any	1
thing	1
rather	1
than	1
Mrs.	1
Willoughby's	1
death.	1
The	1
shock	1
of	1
Colonel	1
Brandon's	1
errand	1
at	1
Barton	1
had	1
been	1
much	1
softened	1
to	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood	1
by	1
her	1
own	1
previous	1
alarm;	1
for	1
so	1
great	1
was	1
her	1
uneasiness	1
about	1
Marianne,	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
already	1
determined	1
to	1
set	1
out	1
for	1
Cleveland	1
on	1
that	1
very	1
day,	1
without	1
waiting	1
for	1
any	1
further	1
intelligence,	1
and	1
had	1
so	1
far	1
settled	1
her	1
journey	1
before	1
his	1
arrival,	1
that	1
the	1
Careys	1
were	1
then	1
expected	1
every	1
moment	1
to	1
fetch	1
Margaret	1
away,	1
as	1
her	1
mother	1
was	1
unwilling	1
to	1
take	1
her	1
where	1
there	1
might	1
be	1
infection.	1
Marianne	1
continued	1
to	1
mend	1
every	1
day,	1
and	1
the	1
brilliant	1
cheerfulness	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood's	1
looks	1
and	1
spirits	1
proved	1
her	1
to	1
be,	1
as	1
she	1
repeatedly	1
declared	1
herself,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
happiest	1
women	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
Elinor	1
could	1
not	1
hear	1
the	1
declaration,	1
nor	1
witness	1
its	1
proofs	1
without	1
sometimes	1
wondering	1
whether	1
her	1
mother	1
ever	1
recollected	1
Edward.	1
But	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood,	1
trusting	1
to	1
the	1
temperate	1
account	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
disappointment	1
which	1
Elinor	1
had	1
sent	1
her,	1
was	1
led	1
away	1
by	1
the	1
exuberance	1
of	1
her	1
joy	1
to	1
think	1
only	1
of	1
what	1
would	1
increase	1
it.	1
Marianne	1
was	1
restored	1
to	1
her	1
from	1
a	1
danger	1
in	1
which,	1
as	1
she	1
now	1
began	1
to	1
feel,	1
her	1
own	1
mistaken	1
judgment	1
in	1
encouraging	1
the	1
unfortunate	1
attachment	1
to	1
Willoughby,	1
had	1
contributed	1
to	1
place	1
her;--	1
and	1
in	1
her	1
recovery	1
she	1
had	1
yet	1
another	1
source	1
of	1
joy	1
unthought	1
of	1
by	1
Elinor.	1
It	1
was	1
thus	1
imparted	1
to	1
her,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
any	1
opportunity	1
of	1
private	1
conference	1
between	1
them	1
occurred.	1
"At	1
last	1
we	1
are	1
alone.	1
My	1
Elinor,	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
yet	1
know	1
all	1
my	1
happiness.	1
Colonel	1
Brandon	1
loves	1
Marianne.	1
He	1
has	1
told	1
me	1
so	1
himself."	1
Her	1
daughter,	1
feeling	1
by	1
turns	1
both	1
pleased	1
and	1
pained,	1
surprised	1
and	1
not	1
surprised,	1
was	1
all	1
silent	1
attention.	1
"You	1
are	1
never	1
like	1
me,	1
dear	1
Elinor,	1
or	1
I	1
should	1
wonder	1
at	1
your	1
composure	1
now.	1
Had	1
I	1
sat	1
down	1
to	1
wish	1
for	1
any	1
possible	1
good	1
to	1
my	1
family,	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
fixed	1
on	1
Colonel	1
Brandon's	1
marrying	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
as	1
the	1
object	1
most	1
desirable.	1
And	1
I	1
believe	1
Marianne	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
most	1
happy	1
with	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
two."	1
Elinor	1
was	1
half	1
inclined	1
to	1
ask	1
her	1
reason	1
for	1
thinking	1
so,	1
because	1
satisfied	1
that	1
none	1
founded	1
on	1
an	1
impartial	1
consideration	1
of	1
their	1
age,	1
characters,	1
or	1
feelings,	1
could	1
be	1
given;--but	1
her	1
mother	1
must	1
always	1
be	1
carried	1
away	1
by	1
her	1
imagination	1
on	1
any	1
interesting	1
subject,	1
and	1
therefore	1
instead	1
of	1
an	1
inquiry,	1
she	1
passed	1
it	1
off	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
"He	1
opened	1
his	1
whole	1
heart	1
to	1
me	1
yesterday	1
as	1
we	1
travelled.	1
It	1
came	1
out	1
quite	1
unawares,	1
quite	1
undesignedly.	1
I,	1
you	1
may	1
well	1
believe,	1
could	1
talk	1
of	1
nothing	1
but	1
my	1
child;--he	1
could	1
not	1
conceal	1
his	1
distress;	1
I	1
saw	1
that	1
it	1
equalled	1
my	1
own,	1
and	1
he	1
perhaps,	1
thinking	1
that	1
mere	1
friendship,	1
as	1
the	1
world	1
now	1
goes,	1
would	1
not	1
justify	1
so	1
warm	1
a	1
sympathy--or	1
rather,	1
not	1
thinking	1
at	1
all,	1
I	1
suppose--giving	1
way	1
to	1
irresistible	1
feelings,	1
made	1
me	1
acquainted	1
with	1
his	1
earnest,	1
tender,	1
constant,	1
affection	1
for	1
Marianne.	1
He	1
has	1
loved	1
her,	1
my	1
Elinor,	1
ever	1
since	1
the	1
first	1
moment	1
of	1
seeing	1
her."	1
Here,	1
however,	1
Elinor	1
perceived,--not	1
the	1
language,	1
not	1
the	1
professions	1
of	1
Colonel	1
Brandon,	1
but	1
the	1
natural	1
embellishments	1
of	1
her	1
mother's	1
active	1
fancy,	1
which	1
fashioned	1
every	1
thing	1
delightful	1
to	1
her	1
as	1
it	1
chose.	1
"His	1
regard	1
for	1
her,	1
infinitely	1
surpassing	1
anything	1
that	1
Willoughby	1
ever	1
felt	1
or	1
feigned,	1
as	1
much	1
more	1
warm,	1
as	1
more	1
sincere	1
or	1
constant--which	1
ever	1
we	1
are	1
to	1
call	1
it--	1
has	1
subsisted	1
through	1
all	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
dear	1
Marianne's	1
unhappy	1
prepossession	1
for	1
that	1
worthless	1
young	1
man!--and	1
without	1
selfishness--without	1
encouraging	1
a	1
hope!--could	1
he	1
have	1
seen	1
her	1
happy	1
with	1
another--Such	1
a	1
noble	1
mind!--	1
such	1
openness,	1
such	1
sincerity!--no	1
one	1
can	1
be	1
deceived	1
in	1
HIM."	1
"Colonel	1
Brandon's	1
character,"	1
said	1
Elinor,	1
"as	1
an	1
excellent	1
man,	1
is	1
well	1
established."	1
"I	1
know	1
it	1
is"--replied	1
her	1
mother	1
seriously,	1
"or	1
after	1
such	1
a	1
warning,	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
the	1
last	1
to	1
encourage	1
such	1
affection,	1
or	1
even	1
to	1
be	1
pleased	1
by	1
it.	1
But	1
his	1
coming	1
for	1
me	1
as	1
he	1
did,	1
with	1
such	1
active,	1
such	1
ready	1
friendship,	1
is	1
enough	1
to	1
prove	1
him	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
worthiest	1
of	1
men."	1
"His	1
character,	1
however,"	1
answered	1
Elinor,	1
"does	1
not	1
rest	1
on	1
ONE	1
act	1
of	1
kindness,	1
to	1
which	1
his	1
affection	1
for	1
Marianne,	1
were	1
humanity	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
case,	1
would	1
have	1
prompted	1
him.	1
To	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings,	1
to	1
the	1
Middletons,	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
long	1
and	1
intimately	1
known;	1
they	1
equally	1
love	1
and	1
respect	1
him;	1
and	1
even	1
my	1
own	1
knowledge	1
of	1
him,	1
though	1
lately	1
acquired,	1
is	1
very	1
considerable;	1
and	1
so	1
highly	1
do	1
I	1
value	1
and	1
esteem	1
him,	1
that	1
if	1
Marianne	1
can	1
be	1
happy	1
with	1
him,	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
ready	1
as	1
yourself	1
to	1
think	1
our	1
connection	1
the	1
greatest	1
blessing	1
to	1
us	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
What	1
answer	1
did	1
you	1
give	1
him?--Did	1
you	1
allow	1
him	1
to	1
hope?"	1
"Oh!	1
my	1
love,	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
then	1
talk	1
of	1
hope	1
to	1
him	1
or	1
to	1
myself.	1
Marianne	1
might	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
be	1
dying.	1
But	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
ask	1
for	1
hope	1
or	1
encouragement.	1
His	1
was	1
an	1
involuntary	1
confidence,	1
an	1
irrepressible	1
effusion	1
to	1
a	1
soothing	1
friend--not	1
an	1
application	1
to	1
a	1
parent.	1
Yet	1
after	1
a	1
time	1
I	1
DID	1
say,	1
for	1
at	1
first	1
I	1
was	1
quite	1
overcome--that	1
if	1
she	1
lived,	1
as	1
I	1
trusted	1
she	1
might,	1
my	1
greatest	1
happiness	1
would	1
lie	1
in	1
promoting	1
their	1
marriage;	1
and	1
since	1
our	1
arrival,	1
since	1
our	1
delightful	1
security,	1
I	1
have	1
repeated	1
it	1
to	1
him	1
more	1
fully,	1
have	1
given	1
him	1
every	1
encouragement	1
in	1
my	1
power.	1
Time,	1
a	1
very	1
little	1
time,	1
I	1
tell	1
him,	1
will	1
do	1
everything;--Marianne's	1
heart	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
wasted	1
for	1
ever	1
on	1
such	1
a	1
man	1
as	1
Willoughby.--	1
His	1
own	1
merits	1
must	1
soon	1
secure	1
it."	1
"To	1
judge	1
from	1
the	1
Colonel's	1
spirits,	1
however,	1
you	1
have	1
not	1
yet	1
made	1
him	1
equally	1
sanguine."	1
"No.--He	1
thinks	1
Marianne's	1
affection	1
too	1
deeply	1
rooted	1
for	1
any	1
change	1
in	1
it	1
under	1
a	1
great	1
length	1
of	1
time,	1
and	1
even	1
supposing	1
her	1
heart	1
again	1
free,	1
is	1
too	1
diffident	1
of	1
himself	1
to	1
believe,	1
that	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
difference	1
of	1
age	1
and	1
disposition	1
he	1
could	1
ever	1
attach	1
her.	1
There,	1
however,	1
he	1
is	1
quite	1
mistaken.	1
His	1
age	1
is	1
only	1
so	1
much	1
beyond	1
hers	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
advantage,	1
as	1
to	1
make	1
his	1
character	1
and	1
principles	1
fixed;--and	1
his	1
disposition,	1
I	1
am	1
well	1
convinced,	1
is	1
exactly	1
the	1
very	1
one	1
to	1
make	1
your	1
sister	1
happy.	1
And	1
his	1
person,	1
his	1
manners	1
too,	1
are	1
all	1
in	1
his	1
favour.	1
My	1
partiality	1
does	1
not	1
blind	1
me;	1
he	1
certainly	1
is	1
not	1
so	1
handsome	1
as	1
Willoughby--but	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
there	1
is	1
something	1
much	1
more	1
pleasing	1
in	1
his	1
countenance.--	1
There	1
was	1
always	1
a	1
something,--if	1
you	1
remember,--in	1
Willoughby's	1
eyes	1
at	1
times,	1
which	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
like."	1
Elinor	1
could	1
NOT	1
remember	1
it;--but	1
her	1
mother,	1
without	1
waiting	1
for	1
her	1
assent,	1
continued,	1
"And	1
his	1
manners,	1
the	1
Colonel's	1
manners	1
are	1
not	1
only	1
more	1
pleasing	1
to	1
me	1
than	1
Willoughby's	1
ever	1
were,	1
but	1
they	1
are	1
of	1
a	1
kind	1
I	1
well	1
know	1
to	1
be	1
more	1
solidly	1
attaching	1
to	1
Marianne.	1
Their	1
gentleness,	1
their	1
genuine	1
attention	1
to	1
other	1
people,	1
and	1
their	1
manly	1
unstudied	1
simplicity	1
is	1
much	1
more	1
accordant	1
with	1
her	1
real	1
disposition,	1
than	1
the	1
liveliness--often	1
artificial,	1
and	1
often	1
ill-timed	1
of	1
the	1
other.	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
sure	1
myself,	1
that	1
had	1
Willoughby	1
turned	1
out	1
as	1
really	1
amiable,	1
as	1
he	1
has	1
proved	1
himself	1
the	1
contrary,	1
Marianne	1
would	1
yet	1
never	1
have	1
been	1
so	1
happy	1
with	1
HIM,	1
as	1
she	1
will	1
be	1
with	1
Colonel	1
Brandon."	1
She	1
paused.--Her	1
daughter	1
could	1
not	1
quite	1
agree	1
with	1
her,	1
but	1
her	1
dissent	1
was	1
not	1
heard,	1
and	1
therefore	1
gave	1
no	1
offence.	1
"At	1
Delaford,	1
she	1
will	1
be	1
within	1
an	1
easy	1
distance	1
of	1
me,"	1
added	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood,	1
"even	1
if	1
I	1
remain	1
at	1
Barton;	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
probability,--for	1
I	1
hear	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
large	1
village,--indeed	1
there	1
certainly	1
MUST	1
be	1
some	1
small	1
house	1
or	1
cottage	1
close	1
by,	1
that	1
would	1
suit	1
us	1
quite	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
our	1
present	1
situation."	1
Poor	1
Elinor!--here	1
was	1
a	1
new	1
scheme	1
for	1
getting	1
her	1
to	1
Delaford!--but	1
her	1
spirit	1
was	1
stubborn.	1
"His	1
fortune	1
too!--for	1
at	1
my	1
time	1
of	1
life	1
you	1
know,	1
everybody	1
cares	1
about	1
THAT;--and	1
though	1
I	1
neither	1
know	1
nor	1
desire	1
to	1
know,	1
what	1
it	1
really	1
is,	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
good	1
one."	1
Here	1
they	1
were	1
interrupted	1
by	1
the	1
entrance	1
of	1
a	1
third	1
person,	1
and	1
Elinor	1
withdrew	1
to	1
think	1
it	1
all	1
over	1
in	1
private,	1
to	1
wish	1
success	1
to	1
her	1
friend,	1
and	1
yet	1
in	1
wishing	1
it,	1
to	1
feel	1
a	1
pang	1
for	1
Willoughby.	1
CHAPTER	1
46	1
Marianne's	1
illness,	1
though	1
weakening	1
in	1
its	1
kind,	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
long	1
enough	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
recovery	1
slow;	1
and	1
with	1
youth,	1
natural	1
strength,	1
and	1
her	1
mother's	1
presence	1
in	1
aid,	1
it	1
proceeded	1
so	1
smoothly	1
as	1
to	1
enable	1
her	1
to	1
remove,	1
within	1
four	1
days	1
after	1
the	1
arrival	1
of	1
the	1
latter,	1
into	1
Mrs.	1
Palmer's	1
dressing-room.	1
When	1
there,	1
at	1
her	1
own	1
particular	1
request,	1
for	1
she	1
was	1
impatient	1
to	1
pour	1
forth	1
her	1
thanks	1
to	1
him	1
for	1
fetching	1
her	1
mother,	1
Colonel	1
Brandon	1
was	1
invited	1
to	1
visit	1
her.	1
His	1
emotion	1
on	1
entering	1
the	1
room,	1
in	1
seeing	1
her	1
altered	1
looks,	1
and	1
in	1
receiving	1
the	1
pale	1
hand	1
which	1
she	1
immediately	1
held	1
out	1
to	1
him,	1
was	1
such,	1
as,	1
in	1
Elinor's	1
conjecture,	1
must	1
arise	1
from	1
something	1
more	1
than	1
his	1
affection	1
for	1
Marianne,	1
or	1
the	1
consciousness	1
of	1
its	1
being	1
known	1
to	1
others;	1
and	1
she	1
soon	1
discovered	1
in	1
his	1
melancholy	1
eye	1
and	1
varying	1
complexion	1
as	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
sister,	1
the	1
probable	1
recurrence	1
of	1
many	1
past	1
scenes	1
of	1
misery	1
to	1
his	1
mind,	1
brought	1
back	1
by	1
that	1
resemblance	1
between	1
Marianne	1
and	1
Eliza	1
already	1
acknowledged,	1
and	1
now	1
strengthened	1
by	1
the	1
hollow	1
eye,	1
the	1
sickly	1
skin,	1
the	1
posture	1
of	1
reclining	1
weakness,	1
and	1
the	1
warm	1
acknowledgment	1
of	1
peculiar	1
obligation.	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood,	1
not	1
less	1
watchful	1
of	1
what	1
passed	1
than	1
her	1
daughter,	1
but	1
with	1
a	1
mind	1
very	1
differently	1
influenced,	1
and	1
therefore	1
watching	1
to	1
very	1
different	1
effect,	1
saw	1
nothing	1
in	1
the	1
Colonel's	1
behaviour	1
but	1
what	1
arose	1
from	1
the	1
most	1
simple	1
and	1
self-evident	1
sensations,	1
while	1
in	1
the	1
actions	1
and	1
words	1
of	1
Marianne	1
she	1
persuaded	1
herself	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
something	1
more	1
than	1
gratitude	1
already	1
dawned.	1
At	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
another	1
day	1
or	1
two,	1
Marianne	1
growing	1
visibly	1
stronger	1
every	1
twelve	1
hours,	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood,	1
urged	1
equally	1
by	1
her	1
own	1
and	1
her	1
daughter's	1
wishes,	1
began	1
to	1
talk	1
of	1
removing	1
to	1
Barton.	1
On	1
HER	1
measures	1
depended	1
those	1
of	1
her	1
two	1
friends;	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
could	1
not	1
quit	1
Cleveland	1
during	1
the	1
Dashwoods'	1
stay;	1
and	1
Colonel	1
Brandon	1
was	1
soon	1
brought,	1
by	1
their	1
united	1
request,	1
to	1
consider	1
his	1
own	1
abode	1
there	1
as	1
equally	1
determinate,	1
if	1
not	1
equally	1
indispensable.	1
At	1
his	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings's	1
united	1
request	1
in	1
return,	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood	1
was	1
prevailed	1
on	1
to	1
accept	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
his	1
carriage	1
on	1
her	1
journey	1
back,	1
for	1
the	1
better	1
accommodation	1
of	1
her	1
sick	1
child;	1
and	1
the	1
Colonel,	1
at	1
the	1
joint	1
invitation	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings,	1
whose	1
active	1
good-nature	1
made	1
her	1
friendly	1
and	1
hospitable	1
for	1
other	1
people	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
herself,	1
engaged	1
with	1
pleasure	1
to	1
redeem	1
it	1
by	1
a	1
visit	1
at	1
the	1
cottage,	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
a	1
few	1
weeks.	1
The	1
day	1
of	1
separation	1
and	1
departure	1
arrived;	1
and	1
Marianne,	1
after	1
taking	1
so	1
particular	1
and	1
lengthened	1
a	1
leave	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings,	1
one	1
so	1
earnestly	1
grateful,	1
so	1
full	1
of	1
respect	1
and	1
kind	1
wishes	1
as	1
seemed	1
due	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
heart	1
from	1
a	1
secret	1
acknowledgment	1
of	1
past	1
inattention,	1
and	1
bidding	1
Colonel	1
Brandon	1
farewell	1
with	1
a	1
cordiality	1
of	1
a	1
friend,	1
was	1
carefully	1
assisted	1
by	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
carriage,	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
seemed	1
anxious	1
that	1
she	1
should	1
engross	1
at	1
least	1
half.	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood	1
and	1
Elinor	1
then	1
followed,	1
and	1
the	1
others	1
were	1
left	1
by	1
themselves,	1
to	1
talk	1
of	1
the	1
travellers,	1
and	1
feel	1
their	1
own	1
dullness,	1
till	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
was	1
summoned	1
to	1
her	1
chaise	1
to	1
take	1
comfort	1
in	1
the	1
gossip	1
of	1
her	1
maid	1
for	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
her	1
two	1
young	1
companions;	1
and	1
Colonel	1
Brandon	1
immediately	1
afterwards	1
took	1
his	1
solitary	1
way	1
to	1
Delaford.	1
The	1
Dashwoods	1
were	1
two	1
days	1
on	1
the	1
road,	1
and	1
Marianne	1
bore	1
her	1
journey	1
on	1
both,	1
without	1
essential	1
fatigue.	1
Every	1
thing	1
that	1
the	1
most	1
zealous	1
affection,	1
the	1
most	1
solicitous	1
care	1
could	1
do	1
to	1
render	1
her	1
comfortable,	1
was	1
the	1
office	1
of	1
each	1
watchful	1
companion,	1
and	1
each	1
found	1
their	1
reward	1
in	1
her	1
bodily	1
ease,	1
and	1
her	1
calmness	1
of	1
spirits.	1
To	1
Elinor,	1
the	1
observation	1
of	1
the	1
latter	1
was	1
particularly	1
grateful.	1
She,	1
who	1
had	1
seen	1
her	1
week	1
after	1
week	1
so	1
constantly	1
suffering,	1
oppressed	1
by	1
anguish	1
of	1
heart	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
neither	1
courage	1
to	1
speak	1
of,	1
nor	1
fortitude	1
to	1
conceal,	1
now	1
saw	1
with	1
a	1
joy,	1
which	1
no	1
other	1
could	1
equally	1
share,	1
an	1
apparent	1
composure	1
of	1
mind,	1
which,	1
in	1
being	1
the	1
result	1
as	1
she	1
trusted	1
of	1
serious	1
reflection,	1
must	1
eventually	1
lead	1
her	1
to	1
contentment	1
and	1
cheerfulness.	1
As	1
they	1
approached	1
Barton,	1
indeed,	1
and	1
entered	1
on	1
scenes	1
of	1
which	1
every	1
field	1
and	1
every	1
tree	1
brought	1
some	1
peculiar,	1
some	1
painful	1
recollection,	1
she	1
grew	1
silent	1
and	1
thoughtful,	1
and	1
turning	1
away	1
her	1
face	1
from	1
their	1
notice,	1
sat	1
earnestly	1
gazing	1
through	1
the	1
window.	1
But	1
here,	1
Elinor	1
could	1
neither	1
wonder	1
nor	1
blame;	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
saw,	1
as	1
she	1
assisted	1
Marianne	1
from	1
the	1
carriage,	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
crying,	1
she	1
saw	1
only	1
an	1
emotion	1
too	1
natural	1
in	1
itself	1
to	1
raise	1
any	1
thing	1
less	1
tender	1
than	1
pity,	1
and	1
in	1
its	1
unobtrusiveness	1
entitled	1
to	1
praise.	1
In	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
her	1
subsequent	1
manner,	1
she	1
traced	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
a	1
mind	1
awakened	1
to	1
reasonable	1
exertion;	1
for	1
no	1
sooner	1
had	1
they	1
entered	1
their	1
common	1
sitting-room,	1
than	1
Marianne	1
turned	1
her	1
eyes	1
around	1
it	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
resolute	1
firmness,	1
as	1
if	1
determined	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
accustom	1
herself	1
to	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
every	1
object	1
with	1
which	1
the	1
remembrance	1
of	1
Willoughby	1
could	1
be	1
connected.--She	1
said	1
little,	1
but	1
every	1
sentence	1
aimed	1
at	1
cheerfulness,	1
and	1
though	1
a	1
sigh	1
sometimes	1
escaped	1
her,	1
it	1
never	1
passed	1
away	1
without	1
the	1
atonement	1
of	1
a	1
smile.	1
After	1
dinner	1
she	1
would	1
try	1
her	1
piano-forte.	1
She	1
went	1
to	1
it;	1
but	1
the	1
music	1
on	1
which	1
her	1
eye	1
first	1
rested	1
was	1
an	1
opera,	1
procured	1
for	1
her	1
by	1
Willoughby,	1
containing	1
some	1
of	1
their	1
favourite	1
duets,	1
and	1
bearing	1
on	1
its	1
outward	1
leaf	1
her	1
own	1
name	1
in	1
his	1
hand-writing.--That	1
would	1
not	1
do.--She	1
shook	1
her	1
head,	1
put	1
the	1
music	1
aside,	1
and	1
after	1
running	1
over	1
the	1
keys	1
for	1
a	1
minute,	1
complained	1
of	1
feebleness	1
in	1
her	1
fingers,	1
and	1
closed	1
the	1
instrument	1
again;	1
declaring	1
however	1
with	1
firmness	1
as	1
she	1
did	1
so,	1
that	1
she	1
should	1
in	1
future	1
practice	1
much.	1
The	1
next	1
morning	1
produced	1
no	1
abatement	1
in	1
these	1
happy	1
symptoms.	1
On	1
the	1
contrary,	1
with	1
a	1
mind	1
and	1
body	1
alike	1
strengthened	1
by	1
rest,	1
she	1
looked	1
and	1
spoke	1
with	1
more	1
genuine	1
spirit,	1
anticipating	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
Margaret's	1
return,	1
and	1
talking	1
of	1
the	1
dear	1
family	1
party	1
which	1
would	1
then	1
be	1
restored,	1
of	1
their	1
mutual	1
pursuits	1
and	1
cheerful	1
society,	1
as	1
the	1
only	1
happiness	1
worth	1
a	1
wish.	1
"When	1
the	1
weather	1
is	1
settled,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
recovered	1
my	1
strength,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"we	1
will	1
take	1
long	1
walks	1
together	1
every	1
day.	1
We	1
will	1
walk	1
to	1
the	1
farm	1
at	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
down,	1
and	1
see	1
how	1
the	1
children	1
go	1
on;	1
we	1
will	1
walk	1
to	1
Sir	1
John's	1
new	1
plantations	1
at	1
Barton	1
Cross,	1
and	1
the	1
Abbeyland;	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
often	1
go	1
the	1
old	1
ruins	1
of	1
the	1
Priory,	1
and	1
try	1
to	1
trace	1
its	1
foundations	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
we	1
are	1
told	1
they	1
once	1
reached.	1
I	1
know	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
happy.	1
I	1
know	1
the	1
summer	1
will	1
pass	1
happily	1
away.	1
I	1
mean	1
never	1
to	1
be	1
later	1
in	1
rising	1
than	1
six,	1
and	1
from	1
that	1
time	1
till	1
dinner	1
I	1
shall	1
divide	1
every	1
moment	1
between	1
music	1
and	1
reading.	1
I	1
have	1
formed	1
my	1
plan,	1
and	1
am	1
determined	1
to	1
enter	1
on	1
a	1
course	1
of	1
serious	1
study.	1
Our	1
own	1
library	1
is	1
too	1
well	1
known	1
to	1
me,	1
to	1
be	1
resorted	1
to	1
for	1
any	1
thing	1
beyond	1
mere	1
amusement.	1
But	1
there	1
are	1
many	1
works	1
well	1
worth	1
reading	1
at	1
the	1
Park;	1
and	1
there	1
are	1
others	1
of	1
more	1
modern	1
production	1
which	1
I	1
know	1
I	1
can	1
borrow	1
of	1
Colonel	1
Brandon.	1
By	1
reading	1
only	1
six	1
hours	1
a-day,	1
I	1
shall	1
gain	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
a	1
twelve-month	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
instruction	1
which	1
I	1
now	1
feel	1
myself	1
to	1
want."	1
Elinor	1
honoured	1
her	1
for	1
a	1
plan	1
which	1
originated	1
so	1
nobly	1
as	1
this;	1
though	1
smiling	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
same	1
eager	1
fancy	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
leading	1
her	1
to	1
the	1
extreme	1
of	1
languid	1
indolence	1
and	1
selfish	1
repining,	1
now	1
at	1
work	1
in	1
introducing	1
excess	1
into	1
a	1
scheme	1
of	1
such	1
rational	1
employment	1
and	1
virtuous	1
self-control.	1
Her	1
smile	1
however	1
changed	1
to	1
a	1
sigh	1
when	1
she	1
remembered	1
that	1
promise	1
to	1
Willoughby	1
was	1
yet	1
unfulfilled,	1
and	1
feared	1
she	1
had	1
that	1
to	1
communicate	1
which	1
might	1
again	1
unsettle	1
the	1
mind	1
of	1
Marianne,	1
and	1
ruin	1
at	1
least	1
for	1
a	1
time	1
this	1
fair	1
prospect	1
of	1
busy	1
tranquillity.	1
Willing	1
therefore	1
to	1
delay	1
the	1
evil	1
hour,	1
she	1
resolved	1
to	1
wait	1
till	1
her	1
sister's	1
health	1
were	1
more	1
secure,	1
before	1
she	1
appointed	1
it.	1
But	1
the	1
resolution	1
was	1
made	1
only	1
to	1
be	1
broken.	1
Marianne	1
had	1
been	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
days	1
at	1
home,	1
before	1
the	1
weather	1
was	1
fine	1
enough	1
for	1
an	1
invalid	1
like	1
herself	1
to	1
venture	1
out.	1
But	1
at	1
last	1
a	1
soft,	1
genial	1
morning	1
appeared;	1
such	1
as	1
might	1
tempt	1
the	1
daughter's	1
wishes	1
and	1
the	1
mother's	1
confidence;	1
and	1
Marianne,	1
leaning	1
on	1
Elinor's	1
arm,	1
was	1
authorised	1
to	1
walk	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
she	1
could	1
without	1
fatigue,	1
in	1
the	1
lane	1
before	1
the	1
house.	1
The	1
sisters	1
set	1
out	1
at	1
a	1
pace,	1
slow	1
as	1
the	1
feebleness	1
of	1
Marianne	1
in	1
an	1
exercise	1
hitherto	1
untried	1
since	1
her	1
illness	1
required;--and	1
they	1
had	1
advanced	1
only	1
so	1
far	1
beyond	1
the	1
house	1
as	1
to	1
admit	1
a	1
full	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
hill,	1
the	1
important	1
hill	1
behind,	1
when	1
pausing	1
with	1
her	1
eyes	1
turned	1
towards	1
it,	1
Marianne	1
calmly	1
said,	1
"There,	1
exactly	1
there,"--pointing	1
with	1
one	1
hand,	1
"on	1
that	1
projecting	1
mound,--there	1
I	1
fell;	1
and	1
there	1
I	1
first	1
saw	1
Willoughby."	1
Her	1
voice	1
sunk	1
with	1
the	1
word,	1
but	1
presently	1
reviving	1
she	1
added,	1
"I	1
am	1
thankful	1
to	1
find	1
that	1
I	1
can	1
look	1
with	1
so	1
little	1
pain	1
on	1
the	1
spot!--shall	1
we	1
ever	1
talk	1
on	1
that	1
subject,	1
Elinor?"--	1
hesitatingly	1
it	1
was	1
said.--"Or	1
will	1
it	1
be	1
wrong?--I	1
can	1
talk	1
of	1
it	1
now,	1
I	1
hope,	1
as	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
do."--	1
Elinor	1
tenderly	1
invited	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
open.	1
"As	1
for	1
regret,"	1
said	1
Marianne,	1
"I	1
have	1
done	1
with	1
that,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
HE	1
is	1
concerned.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
mean	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
you	1
of	1
what	1
my	1
feelings	1
have	1
been	1
for	1
him,	1
but	1
what	1
they	1
are	1
NOW.--At	1
present,	1
if	1
I	1
could	1
be	1
satisfied	1
on	1
one	1
point,	1
if	1
I	1
could	1
be	1
allowed	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
ALWAYS	1
acting	1
a	1
part,	1
not	1
ALWAYS	1
deceiving	1
me;--but	1
above	1
all,	1
if	1
I	1
could	1
be	1
assured	1
that	1
he	1
never	1
was	1
so	1
VERY	1
wicked	1
as	1
my	1
fears	1
have	1
sometimes	1
fancied	1
him,	1
since	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
that	1
unfortunate	1
girl"--	1
She	1
stopt.	1
Elinor	1
joyfully	1
treasured	1
her	1
words	1
as	1
she	1
answered,	1
"If	1
you	1
could	1
be	1
assured	1
of	1
that,	1
you	1
think	1
you	1
should	1
be	1
easy."	1
"Yes.	1
My	1
peace	1
of	1
mind	1
is	1
doubly	1
involved	1
in	1
it;--	1
for	1
not	1
only	1
is	1
it	1
horrible	1
to	1
suspect	1
a	1
person,	1
who	1
has	1
been	1
what	1
HE	1
has	1
been	1
to	1
ME,	1
of	1
such	1
designs,--but	1
what	1
must	1
it	1
make	1
me	1
appear	1
to	1
myself?--What	1
in	1
a	1
situation	1
like	1
mine,	1
but	1
a	1
most	1
shamefully	1
unguarded	1
affection	1
could	1
expose	1
me	1
to"--	1
"How	1
then,"	1
asked	1
her	1
sister,	1
"would	1
you	1
account	1
for	1
his	1
behaviour?"	1
"I	1
would	1
suppose	1
him,--Oh,	1
how	1
gladly	1
would	1
I	1
suppose	1
him,	1
only	1
fickle,	1
very,	1
very	1
fickle."	1
Elinor	1
said	1
no	1
more.	1
She	1
was	1
debating	1
within	1
herself	1
on	1
the	1
eligibility	1
of	1
beginning	1
her	1
story	1
directly,	1
or	1
postponing	1
it	1
till	1
Marianne	1
were	1
in	1
stronger	1
health;--	1
and	1
they	1
crept	1
on	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
in	1
silence.	1
"I	1
am	1
not	1
wishing	1
him	1
too	1
much	1
good,"	1
said	1
Marianne	1
at	1
last	1
with	1
a	1
sigh,	1
"when	1
I	1
wish	1
his	1
secret	1
reflections	1
may	1
be	1
no	1
more	1
unpleasant	1
than	1
my	1
own.	1
He	1
will	1
suffer	1
enough	1
in	1
them."	1
"Do	1
you	1
compare	1
your	1
conduct	1
with	1
his?"	1
"No.	1
I	1
compare	1
it	1
with	1
what	1
it	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
been;	1
I	1
compare	1
it	1
with	1
yours."	1
"Our	1
situations	1
have	1
borne	1
little	1
resemblance."	1
"They	1
have	1
borne	1
more	1
than	1
our	1
conduct.--Do	1
not,	1
my	1
dearest	1
Elinor,	1
let	1
your	1
kindness	1
defend	1
what	1
I	1
know	1
your	1
judgment	1
must	1
censure.	1
My	1
illness	1
has	1
made	1
me	1
think--	1
It	1
has	1
given	1
me	1
leisure	1
and	1
calmness	1
for	1
serious	1
recollection.	1
Long	1
before	1
I	1
was	1
enough	1
recovered	1
to	1
talk,	1
I	1
was	1
perfectly	1
able	1
to	1
reflect.	1
I	1
considered	1
the	1
past:	1
I	1
saw	1
in	1
my	1
own	1
behaviour,	1
since	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
our	1
acquaintance	1
with	1
him	1
last	1
autumn,	1
nothing	1
but	1
a	1
series	1
of	1
imprudence	1
towards	1
myself,	1
and	1
want	1
of	1
kindness	1
to	1
others.	1
I	1
saw	1
that	1
my	1
own	1
feelings	1
had	1
prepared	1
my	1
sufferings,	1
and	1
that	1
my	1
want	1
of	1
fortitude	1
under	1
them	1
had	1
almost	1
led	1
me	1
to	1
the	1
grave.	1
My	1
illness,	1
I	1
well	1
knew,	1
had	1
been	1
entirely	1
brought	1
on	1
by	1
myself	1
by	1
such	1
negligence	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
health,	1
as	1
I	1
had	1
felt	1
even	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
to	1
be	1
wrong.	1
Had	1
I	1
died,--it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
self-destruction.	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
my	1
danger	1
till	1
the	1
danger	1
was	1
removed;	1
but	1
with	1
such	1
feelings	1
as	1
these	1
reflections	1
gave	1
me,	1
I	1
wonder	1
at	1
my	1
recovery,--wonder	1
that	1
the	1
very	1
eagerness	1
of	1
my	1
desire	1
to	1
live,	1
to	1
have	1
time	1
for	1
atonement	1
to	1
my	1
God,	1
and	1
to	1
you	1
all,	1
did	1
not	1
kill	1
me	1
at	1
once.	1
Had	1
I	1
died,--	1
in	1
what	1
peculiar	1
misery	1
should	1
I	1
have	1
left	1
you,	1
my	1
nurse,	1
my	1
friend,	1
my	1
sister!--You,	1
who	1
had	1
seen	1
all	1
the	1
fretful	1
selfishness	1
of	1
my	1
latter	1
days;	1
who	1
had	1
known	1
all	1
the	1
murmurings	1
of	1
my	1
heart!--How	1
should	1
I	1
have	1
lived	1
in	1
YOUR	1
remembrance!--My	1
mother	1
too!	1
How	1
could	1
you	1
have	1
consoled	1
her!--I	1
cannot	1
express	1
my	1
own	1
abhorrence	1
of	1
myself.	1
Whenever	1
I	1
looked	1
towards	1
the	1
past,	1
I	1
saw	1
some	1
duty	1
neglected,	1
or	1
some	1
failing	1
indulged.	1
Every	1
body	1
seemed	1
injured	1
by	1
me.	1
The	1
kindness,	1
the	1
unceasing	1
kindness	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings,	1
I	1
had	1
repaid	1
with	1
ungrateful	1
contempt.	1
To	1
the	1
Middletons,	1
to	1
the	1
Palmers,	1
the	1
Steeles,	1
to	1
every	1
common	1
acquaintance	1
even,	1
I	1
had	1
been	1
insolent	1
and	1
unjust;	1
with	1
a	1
heart	1
hardened	1
against	1
their	1
merits,	1
and	1
a	1
temper	1
irritated	1
by	1
their	1
very	1
attention.--To	1
John,	1
to	1
Fanny,--yes,	1
even	1
to	1
them,	1
little	1
as	1
they	1
deserve,	1
I	1
had	1
given	1
less	1
than	1
their	1
due.	1
But	1
you,--you	1
above	1
all,	1
above	1
my	1
mother,	1
had	1
been	1
wronged	1
by	1
me.	1
I,	1
and	1
only	1
I,	1
knew	1
your	1
heart	1
and	1
its	1
sorrows;	1
yet	1
to	1
what	1
did	1
it	1
influence	1
me?--not	1
to	1
any	1
compassion	1
that	1
could	1
benefit	1
you	1
or	1
myself.--Your	1
example	1
was	1
before	1
me;	1
but	1
to	1
what	1
avail?--Was	1
I	1
more	1
considerate	1
of	1
you	1
and	1
your	1
comfort?	1
Did	1
I	1
imitate	1
your	1
forbearance,	1
or	1
lessen	1
your	1
restraints,	1
by	1
taking	1
any	1
part	1
in	1
those	1
offices	1
of	1
general	1
complaisance	1
or	1
particular	1
gratitude	1
which	1
you	1
had	1
hitherto	1
been	1
left	1
to	1
discharge	1
alone?--No;--	1
not	1
less	1
when	1
I	1
knew	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
unhappy,	1
than	1
when	1
I	1
had	1
believed	1
you	1
at	1
ease,	1
did	1
I	1
turn	1
away	1
from	1
every	1
exertion	1
of	1
duty	1
or	1
friendship;	1
scarcely	1
allowing	1
sorrow	1
to	1
exist	1
but	1
with	1
me,	1
regretting	1
only	1
THAT	1
heart	1
which	1
had	1
deserted	1
and	1
wronged	1
me,	1
and	1
leaving	1
you,	1
for	1
or	1
I	1
professed	1
an	1
unbounded	1
affection,	1
to	1
be	1
miserable	1
for	1
my	1
sake."	1
Here	1
ceased	1
the	1
rapid	1
flow	1
of	1
her	1
self-reproving	1
spirit;	1
and	1
Elinor,	1
impatient	1
to	1
soothe,	1
though	1
too	1
honest	1
to	1
flatter,	1
gave	1
her	1
instantly	1
that	1
praise	1
and	1
support	1
which	1
her	1
frankness	1
and	1
her	1
contrition	1
so	1
well	1
deserved.	1
Marianne	1
pressed	1
her	1
hand	1
and	1
replied,	1
"You	1
are	1
very	1
good.--The	1
future	1
must	1
be	1
my	1
proof.	1
I	1
have	1
laid	1
down	1
my	1
plan,	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
am	1
capable	1
of	1
adhering	1
to	1
it--my	1
feelings	1
shall	1
be	1
governed	1
and	1
my	1
temper	1
improved.	1
They	1
shall	1
no	1
longer	1
worry	1
others,	1
nor	1
torture	1
myself.	1
I	1
shall	1
now	1
live	1
solely	1
for	1
my	1
family.	1
You,	1
my	1
mother,	1
and	1
Margaret,	1
must	1
henceforth	1
be	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
me;	1
you	1
will	1
share	1
my	1
affections	1
entirely	1
between	1
you.	1
>From	1
you,	1
from	1
my	1
home,	1
I	1
shall	1
never	1
again	1
have	1
the	1
smallest	1
incitement	1
to	1
move;	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
do	1
mix	1
in	1
other	1
society,	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
only	1
to	1
shew	1
that	1
my	1
spirit	1
is	1
humbled,	1
my	1
heart	1
amended,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
can	1
practise	1
the	1
civilities,	1
the	1
lesser	1
duties	1
of	1
life,	1
with	1
gentleness	1
and	1
forbearance.	1
As	1
for	1
Willoughby--to	1
say	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
soon	1
or	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
ever	1
forget	1
him,	1
would	1
be	1
idle.	1
His	1
remembrance	1
can	1
be	1
overcome	1
by	1
no	1
change	1
of	1
circumstances	1
or	1
opinions.	1
But	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
regulated,	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
checked	1
by	1
religion,	1
by	1
reason,	1
by	1
constant	1
employment."	1
She	1
paused--and	1
added	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice,	1
"If	1
I	1
could	1
but	1
know	1
HIS	1
heart,	1
everything	1
would	1
become	1
easy."	1
Elinor,	1
who	1
had	1
now	1
been	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
reflecting	1
on	1
the	1
propriety	1
or	1
impropriety	1
of	1
speedily	1
hazarding	1
her	1
narration,	1
without	1
feeling	1
at	1
all	1
nearer	1
decision	1
than	1
at	1
first,	1
heard	1
this;	1
and	1
perceiving	1
that	1
as	1
reflection	1
did	1
nothing,	1
resolution	1
must	1
do	1
all,	1
soon	1
found	1
herself	1
leading	1
to	1
the	1
fact.	1
She	1
managed	1
the	1
recital,	1
as	1
she	1
hoped,	1
with	1
address;	1
prepared	1
her	1
anxious	1
listener	1
with	1
caution;	1
related	1
simply	1
and	1
honestly	1
the	1
chief	1
points	1
on	1
which	1
Willoughby	1
grounded	1
his	1
apology;	1
did	1
justice	1
to	1
his	1
repentance,	1
and	1
softened	1
only	1
his	1
protestations	1
of	1
present	1
regard.	1
Marianne	1
said	1
not	1
a	1
word.--She	1
trembled,	1
her	1
eyes	1
were	1
fixed	1
on	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
her	1
lips	1
became	1
whiter	1
than	1
even	1
sickness	1
had	1
left	1
them.	1
A	1
thousand	1
inquiries	1
sprung	1
up	1
from	1
her	1
heart,	1
but	1
she	1
dared	1
not	1
urge	1
one.	1
She	1
caught	1
every	1
syllable	1
with	1
panting	1
eagerness;	1
her	1
hand,	1
unknowingly	1
to	1
herself,	1
closely	1
pressed	1
her	1
sister's,	1
and	1
tears	1
covered	1
her	1
cheeks.	1
Elinor,	1
dreading	1
her	1
being	1
tired,	1
led	1
her	1
towards	1
home;	1
and	1
till	1
they	1
reached	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
cottage,	1
easily	1
conjecturing	1
what	1
her	1
curiosity	1
must	1
be	1
though	1
no	1
question	1
was	1
suffered	1
to	1
speak	1
it,	1
talked	1
of	1
nothing	1
but	1
Willoughby,	1
and	1
their	1
conversation	1
together;	1
and	1
was	1
carefully	1
minute	1
in	1
every	1
particular	1
of	1
speech	1
and	1
look,	1
where	1
minuteness	1
could	1
be	1
safely	1
indulged.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
entered	1
the	1
house,	1
Marianne	1
with	1
a	1
kiss	1
of	1
gratitude	1
and	1
these	1
two	1
words	1
just	1
articulate	1
through	1
her	1
tears,	1
"Tell	1
mama,"	1
withdrew	1
from	1
her	1
sister	1
and	1
walked	1
slowly	1
up	1
stairs.	1
Elinor	1
would	1
not	1
attempt	1
to	1
disturb	1
a	1
solitude	1
so	1
reasonable	1
as	1
what	1
she	1
now	1
sought;	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
mind	1
anxiously	1
pre-arranging	1
its	1
result,	1
and	1
a	1
resolution	1
of	1
reviving	1
the	1
subject	1
again,	1
should	1
Marianne	1
fail	1
to	1
do	1
it,	1
she	1
turned	1
into	1
the	1
parlour	1
to	1
fulfill	1
her	1
parting	1
injunction.	1
CHAPTER	1
47	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood	1
did	1
not	1
hear	1
unmoved	1
the	1
vindication	1
of	1
her	1
former	1
favourite.	1
She	1
rejoiced	1
in	1
his	1
being	1
cleared	1
from	1
some	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
imputed	1
guilt;--she	1
was	1
sorry	1
for	1
him;--she	1
wished	1
him	1
happy.	1
But	1
the	1
feelings	1
of	1
the	1
past	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
recalled.--Nothing	1
could	1
restore	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
faith	1
unbroken--a	1
character	1
unblemished,	1
to	1
Marianne.	1
Nothing	1
could	1
do	1
away	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
what	1
the	1
latter	1
had	1
suffered	1
through	1
his	1
means,	1
nor	1
remove	1
the	1
guilt	1
of	1
his	1
conduct	1
towards	1
Eliza.	1
Nothing	1
could	1
replace	1
him,	1
therefore,	1
in	1
her	1
former	1
esteem,	1
nor	1
injure	1
the	1
interests	1
of	1
Colonel	1
Brandon.	1
Had	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood,	1
like	1
her	1
daughter,	1
heard	1
Willoughby's	1
story	1
from	1
himself--had	1
she	1
witnessed	1
his	1
distress,	1
and	1
been	1
under	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
his	1
countenance	1
and	1
his	1
manner,	1
it	1
is	1
probable	1
that	1
her	1
compassion	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
greater.	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
neither	1
in	1
Elinor's	1
power,	1
nor	1
in	1
her	1
wish,	1
to	1
rouse	1
such	1
feelings	1
in	1
another,	1
by	1
her	1
retailed	1
explanation,	1
as	1
had	1
at	1
first	1
been	1
called	1
forth	1
in	1
herself.	1
Reflection	1
had	1
given	1
calmness	1
to	1
her	1
judgment,	1
and	1
sobered	1
her	1
own	1
opinion	1
of	1
Willoughby's	1
deserts;--	1
she	1
wished,	1
therefore,	1
to	1
declare	1
only	1
the	1
simple	1
truth,	1
and	1
lay	1
open	1
such	1
facts	1
as	1
were	1
really	1
due	1
to	1
his	1
character,	1
without	1
any	1
embellishment	1
of	1
tenderness	1
to	1
lead	1
the	1
fancy	1
astray.	1
In	1
the	1
evening,	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
three	1
together,	1
Marianne	1
began	1
voluntarily	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
him	1
again;--	1
but	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
without	1
an	1
effort,	1
the	1
restless,	1
unquiet	1
thoughtfulness	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
previously	1
sitting--her	1
rising	1
colour,	1
as	1
she	1
spoke,--	1
and	1
her	1
unsteady	1
voice,	1
plainly	1
shewed.	1
"I	1
wish	1
to	1
assure	1
you	1
both,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"that	1
I	1
see	1
every	1
thing--as	1
you	1
can	1
desire	1
me	1
to	1
do."	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood	1
would	1
have	1
interrupted	1
her	1
instantly	1
with	1
soothing	1
tenderness,	1
had	1
not	1
Elinor,	1
who	1
really	1
wished	1
to	1
hear	1
her	1
sister's	1
unbiased	1
opinion,	1
by	1
an	1
eager	1
sign,	1
engaged	1
her	1
silence.	1
Marianne	1
slowly	1
continued--	1
"It	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
relief	1
to	1
me--what	1
Elinor	1
told	1
me	1
this	1
morning--I	1
have	1
now	1
heard	1
exactly	1
what	1
I	1
wished	1
to	1
hear."--For	1
some	1
moments	1
her	1
voice	1
was	1
lost;	1
but	1
recovering	1
herself,	1
she	1
added,	1
and	1
with	1
greater	1
calmness	1
than	1
before--"I	1
am	1
now	1
perfectly	1
satisfied,	1
I	1
wish	1
for	1
no	1
change.	1
I	1
never	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
happy	1
with	1
him,	1
after	1
knowing,	1
as	1
sooner	1
or	1
later	1
I	1
must	1
have	1
known,	1
all	1
this.--I	1
should	1
have	1
had	1
no	1
confidence,	1
no	1
esteem.	1
Nothing	1
could	1
have	1
done	1
it	1
away	1
to	1
my	1
feelings."	1
"I	1
know	1
it--I	1
know	1
it,"	1
cried	1
her	1
mother.	1
"Happy	1
with	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
libertine	1
practices!--With	1
one	1
who	1
so	1
injured	1
the	1
peace	1
of	1
the	1
dearest	1
of	1
our	1
friends,	1
and	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
men!--No--my	1
Marianne	1
has	1
not	1
a	1
heart	1
to	1
be	1
made	1
happy	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
man!--Her	1
conscience,	1
her	1
sensitive	1
conscience,	1
would	1
have	1
felt	1
all	1
that	1
the	1
conscience	1
of	1
her	1
husband	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
felt."	1
Marianne	1
sighed,	1
and	1
repeated,	1
"I	1
wish	1
for	1
no	1
change."	1
"You	1
consider	1
the	1
matter,"	1
said	1
Elinor,	1
"exactly	1
as	1
a	1
good	1
mind	1
and	1
a	1
sound	1
understanding	1
must	1
consider	1
it;	1
and	1
I	1
dare	1
say	1
you	1
perceive,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
myself,	1
not	1
only	1
in	1
this,	1
but	1
in	1
many	1
other	1
circumstances,	1
reason	1
enough	1
to	1
be	1
convinced	1
that	1
your	1
marriage	1
must	1
have	1
involved	1
you	1
in	1
many	1
certain	1
troubles	1
and	1
disappointments,	1
in	1
which	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
poorly	1
supported	1
by	1
an	1
affection,	1
on	1
his	1
side,	1
much	1
less	1
certain.	1
Had	1
you	1
married,	1
you	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
always	1
poor.	1
His	1
expensiveness	1
is	1
acknowledged	1
even	1
by	1
himself,	1
and	1
his	1
whole	1
conduct	1
declares	1
that	1
self-denial	1
is	1
a	1
word	1
hardly	1
understood	1
by	1
him.	1
His	1
demands	1
and	1
your	1
inexperience	1
together,	1
on	1
a	1
small,	1
very	1
small	1
income,	1
must	1
have	1
brought	1
on	1
distresses	1
which	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
the	1
LESS	1
grievous	1
to	1
you,	1
from	1
having	1
been	1
entirely	1
unknown	1
and	1
unthought	1
of	1
before.	1
YOUR	1
sense	1
of	1
honour	1
and	1
honesty	1
would	1
have	1
led	1
you,	1
I	1
know,	1
when	1
aware	1
of	1
your	1
situation,	1
to	1
attempt	1
all	1
the	1
economy	1
that	1
would	1
appear	1
to	1
you	1
possible:	1
and,	1
perhaps,	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
your	1
frugality	1
retrenched	1
only	1
on	1
your	1
own	1
comfort,	1
you	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
suffered	1
to	1
practice	1
it,	1
but	1
beyond	1
that--	1
and	1
how	1
little	1
could	1
the	1
utmost	1
of	1
your	1
single	1
management	1
do	1
to	1
stop	1
the	1
ruin	1
which	1
had	1
begun	1
before	1
your	1
marriage?--	1
Beyond	1
THAT,	1
had	1
you	1
endeavoured,	1
however	1
reasonably,	1
to	1
abridge	1
HIS	1
enjoyments,	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
feared,	1
that	1
instead	1
of	1
prevailing	1
on	1
feelings	1
so	1
selfish	1
to	1
consent	1
to	1
it,	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
lessened	1
your	1
own	1
influence	1
on	1
his	1
heart,	1
and	1
made	1
him	1
regret	1
the	1
connection	1
which	1
had	1
involved	1
him	1
in	1
such	1
difficulties?"	1
Marianne's	1
lips	1
quivered,	1
and	1
she	1
repeated	1
the	1
word	1
"Selfish?"	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
that	1
implied--"do	1
you	1
really	1
think	1
him	1
selfish?"	1
"The	1
whole	1
of	1
his	1
behaviour,"	1
replied	1
Elinor,	1
"from	1
the	1
beginning	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
affair,	1
has	1
been	1
grounded	1
on	1
selfishness.	1
It	1
was	1
selfishness	1
which	1
first	1
made	1
him	1
sport	1
with	1
your	1
affections;	1
which	1
afterwards,	1
when	1
his	1
own	1
were	1
engaged,	1
made	1
him	1
delay	1
the	1
confession	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
which	1
finally	1
carried	1
him	1
from	1
Barton.	1
His	1
own	1
enjoyment,	1
or	1
his	1
own	1
ease,	1
was,	1
in	1
every	1
particular,	1
his	1
ruling	1
principle."	1
"It	1
is	1
very	1
true.	1
MY	1
happiness	1
never	1
was	1
his	1
object."	1
"At	1
present,"	1
continued	1
Elinor,	1
"he	1
regrets	1
what	1
he	1
has	1
done.	1
And	1
why	1
does	1
he	1
regret	1
it?--Because	1
he	1
finds	1
it	1
has	1
not	1
answered	1
towards	1
himself.	1
It	1
has	1
not	1
made	1
him	1
happy.	1
His	1
circumstances	1
are	1
now	1
unembarrassed--he	1
suffers	1
from	1
no	1
evil	1
of	1
that	1
kind;	1
and	1
he	1
thinks	1
only	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
married	1
a	1
woman	1
of	1
a	1
less	1
amiable	1
temper	1
than	1
yourself.	1
But	1
does	1
it	1
follow	1
that	1
had	1
he	1
married	1
you,	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
happy?--The	1
inconveniences	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
different.	1
He	1
would	1
then	1
have	1
suffered	1
under	1
the	1
pecuniary	1
distresses	1
which,	1
because	1
they	1
are	1
removed,	1
he	1
now	1
reckons	1
as	1
nothing.	1
He	1
would	1
have	1
had	1
a	1
wife	1
of	1
whose	1
temper	1
he	1
could	1
make	1
no	1
complaint,	1
but	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
always	1
necessitous--always	1
poor;	1
and	1
probably	1
would	1
soon	1
have	1
learned	1
to	1
rank	1
the	1
innumerable	1
comforts	1
of	1
a	1
clear	1
estate	1
and	1
good	1
income	1
as	1
of	1
far	1
more	1
importance,	1
even	1
to	1
domestic	1
happiness,	1
than	1
the	1
mere	1
temper	1
of	1
a	1
wife."	1
"I	1
have	1
not	1
a	1
doubt	1
of	1
it,"	1
said	1
Marianne;	1
"and	1
I	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
regret--nothing	1
but	1
my	1
own	1
folly."	1
"Rather	1
say	1
your	1
mother's	1
imprudence,	1
my	1
child,"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood;	1
"SHE	1
must	1
be	1
answerable."	1
Marianne	1
would	1
not	1
let	1
her	1
proceed;--and	1
Elinor,	1
satisfied	1
that	1
each	1
felt	1
their	1
own	1
error,	1
wished	1
to	1
avoid	1
any	1
survey	1
of	1
the	1
past	1
that	1
might	1
weaken	1
her	1
sister's	1
spirits;	1
she,	1
therefore,	1
pursuing	1
the	1
first	1
subject,	1
immediately	1
continued,	1
"One	1
observation	1
may,	1
I	1
think,	1
be	1
fairly	1
drawn	1
from	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
the	1
story--that	1
all	1
Willoughby's	1
difficulties	1
have	1
arisen	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
offence	1
against	1
virtue,	1
in	1
his	1
behaviour	1
to	1
Eliza	1
Williams.	1
That	1
crime	1
has	1
been	1
the	1
origin	1
of	1
every	1
lesser	1
one,	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
present	1
discontents."	1
Marianne	1
assented	1
most	1
feelingly	1
to	1
the	1
remark;	1
and	1
her	1
mother	1
was	1
led	1
by	1
it	1
to	1
an	1
enumeration	1
of	1
Colonel	1
Brandon's	1
injuries	1
and	1
merits,	1
warm	1
as	1
friendship	1
and	1
design	1
could	1
unitedly	1
dictate.	1
Her	1
daughter	1
did	1
not	1
look,	1
however,	1
as	1
if	1
much	1
of	1
it	1
were	1
heard	1
by	1
her.	1
Elinor,	1
according	1
to	1
her	1
expectation,	1
saw	1
on	1
the	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
following	1
days,	1
that	1
Marianne	1
did	1
not	1
continue	1
to	1
gain	1
strength	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
done;	1
but	1
while	1
her	1
resolution	1
was	1
unsubdued,	1
and	1
she	1
still	1
tried	1
to	1
appear	1
cheerful	1
and	1
easy,	1
her	1
sister	1
could	1
safely	1
trust	1
to	1
the	1
effect	1
of	1
time	1
upon	1
her	1
health.	1
Margaret	1
returned,	1
and	1
the	1
family	1
were	1
again	1
all	1
restored	1
to	1
each	1
other,	1
again	1
quietly	1
settled	1
at	1
the	1
cottage;	1
and	1
if	1
not	1
pursuing	1
their	1
usual	1
studies	1
with	1
quite	1
so	1
much	1
vigour	1
as	1
when	1
they	1
first	1
came	1
to	1
Barton,	1
at	1
least	1
planning	1
a	1
vigorous	1
prosecution	1
of	1
them	1
in	1
future.	1
Elinor	1
grew	1
impatient	1
for	1
some	1
tidings	1
of	1
Edward.	1
She	1
had	1
heard	1
nothing	1
of	1
him	1
since	1
her	1
leaving	1
London,	1
nothing	1
new	1
of	1
his	1
plans,	1
nothing	1
certain	1
even	1
of	1
his	1
present	1
abode.	1
Some	1
letters	1
had	1
passed	1
between	1
her	1
and	1
her	1
brother,	1
in	1
consequence	1
of	1
Marianne's	1
illness;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
of	1
John's,	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
this	1
sentence:--	1
"We	1
know	1
nothing	1
of	1
our	1
unfortunate	1
Edward,	1
and	1
can	1
make	1
no	1
enquiries	1
on	1
so	1
prohibited	1
a	1
subject,	1
but	1
conclude	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
still	1
at	1
Oxford;"	1
which	1
was	1
all	1
the	1
intelligence	1
of	1
Edward	1
afforded	1
her	1
by	1
the	1
correspondence,	1
for	1
his	1
name	1
was	1
not	1
even	1
mentioned	1
in	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
succeeding	1
letters.	1
She	1
was	1
not	1
doomed,	1
however,	1
to	1
be	1
long	1
in	1
ignorance	1
of	1
his	1
measures.	1
Their	1
man-servant	1
had	1
been	1
sent	1
one	1
morning	1
to	1
Exeter	1
on	1
business;	1
and	1
when,	1
as	1
he	1
waited	1
at	1
table,	1
he	1
had	1
satisfied	1
the	1
inquiries	1
of	1
his	1
mistress	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
event	1
of	1
his	1
errand,	1
this	1
was	1
his	1
voluntary	1
communication--	1
"I	1
suppose	1
you	1
know,	1
ma'am,	1
that	1
Mr.	1
Ferrars	1
is	1
married."	1
Marianne	1
gave	1
a	1
violent	1
start,	1
fixed	1
her	1
eyes	1
upon	1
Elinor,	1
saw	1
her	1
turning	1
pale,	1
and	1
fell	1
back	1
in	1
her	1
chair	1
in	1
hysterics.	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood,	1
whose	1
eyes,	1
as	1
she	1
answered	1
the	1
servant's	1
inquiry,	1
had	1
intuitively	1
taken	1
the	1
same	1
direction,	1
was	1
shocked	1
to	1
perceive	1
by	1
Elinor's	1
countenance	1
how	1
much	1
she	1
really	1
suffered,	1
and	1
a	1
moment	1
afterwards,	1
alike	1
distressed	1
by	1
Marianne's	1
situation,	1
knew	1
not	1
on	1
which	1
child	1
to	1
bestow	1
her	1
principal	1
attention.	1
The	1
servant,	1
who	1
saw	1
only	1
that	1
Miss	1
Marianne	1
was	1
taken	1
ill,	1
had	1
sense	1
enough	1
to	1
call	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
maids,	1
who,	1
with	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood's	1
assistance,	1
supported	1
her	1
into	1
the	1
other	1
room.	1
By	1
that	1
time,	1
Marianne	1
was	1
rather	1
better,	1
and	1
her	1
mother	1
leaving	1
her	1
to	1
the	1
care	1
of	1
Margaret	1
and	1
the	1
maid,	1
returned	1
to	1
Elinor,	1
who,	1
though	1
still	1
much	1
disordered,	1
had	1
so	1
far	1
recovered	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
her	1
reason	1
and	1
voice	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
just	1
beginning	1
an	1
inquiry	1
of	1
Thomas,	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
source	1
of	1
his	1
intelligence.	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood	1
immediately	1
took	1
all	1
that	1
trouble	1
on	1
herself;	1
and	1
Elinor	1
had	1
the	1
benefit	1
of	1
the	1
information	1
without	1
the	1
exertion	1
of	1
seeking	1
it.	1
"Who	1
told	1
you	1
that	1
Mr.	1
Ferrars	1
was	1
married,	1
Thomas?"	1
"I	1
see	1
Mr.	1
Ferrars	1
myself,	1
ma'am,	1
this	1
morning	1
in	1
Exeter,	1
and	1
his	1
lady	1
too,	1
Miss	1
Steele	1
as	1
was.	1
They	1
was	1
stopping	1
in	1
a	1
chaise	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
New	1
London	1
Inn,	1
as	1
I	1
went	1
there	1
with	1
a	1
message	1
from	1
Sally	1
at	1
the	1
Park	1
to	1
her	1
brother,	1
who	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
post-boys.	1
I	1
happened	1
to	1
look	1
up	1
as	1
I	1
went	1
by	1
the	1
chaise,	1
and	1
so	1
I	1
see	1
directly	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
youngest	1
Miss	1
Steele;	1
so	1
I	1
took	1
off	1
my	1
hat,	1
and	1
she	1
knew	1
me	1
and	1
called	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
inquired	1
after	1
you,	1
ma'am,	1
and	1
the	1
young	1
ladies,	1
especially	1
Miss	1
Marianne,	1
and	1
bid	1
me	1
I	1
should	1
give	1
her	1
compliments	1
and	1
Mr.	1
Ferrars's,	1
their	1
best	1
compliments	1
and	1
service,	1
and	1
how	1
sorry	1
they	1
was	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
time	1
to	1
come	1
on	1
and	1
see	1
you,	1
but	1
they	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
hurry	1
to	1
go	1
forwards,	1
for	1
they	1
was	1
going	1
further	1
down	1
for	1
a	1
little	1
while,	1
but	1
howsever,	1
when	1
they	1
come	1
back,	1
they'd	1
make	1
sure	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
see	1
you."	1
"But	1
did	1
she	1
tell	1
you	1
she	1
was	1
married,	1
Thomas?"	1
"Yes,	1
ma'am.	1
She	1
smiled,	1
and	1
said	1
how	1
she	1
had	1
changed	1
her	1
name	1
since	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
these	1
parts.	1
She	1
was	1
always	1
a	1
very	1
affable	1
and	1
free-spoken	1
young	1
lady,	1
and	1
very	1
civil	1
behaved.	1
So,	1
I	1
made	1
free	1
to	1
wish	1
her	1
joy."	1
"Was	1
Mr.	1
Ferrars	1
in	1
the	1
carriage	1
with	1
her?"	1
"Yes,	1
ma'am,	1
I	1
just	1
see	1
him	1
leaning	1
back	1
in	1
it,	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
look	1
up;--he	1
never	1
was	1
a	1
gentleman	1
much	1
for	1
talking."	1
Elinor's	1
heart	1
could	1
easily	1
account	1
for	1
his	1
not	1
putting	1
himself	1
forward;	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood	1
probably	1
found	1
the	1
same	1
explanation.	1
"Was	1
there	1
no	1
one	1
else	1
in	1
the	1
carriage?"	1
"No,	1
ma'am,	1
only	1
they	1
two."	1
"Do	1
you	1
know	1
where	1
they	1
came	1
from?"	1
"They	1
come	1
straight	1
from	1
town,	1
as	1
Miss	1
Lucy--	1
Mrs.	1
Ferrars	1
told	1
me."	1
"And	1
are	1
they	1
going	1
farther	1
westward?"	1
"Yes,	1
ma'am--but	1
not	1
to	1
bide	1
long.	1
They	1
will	1
soon	1
be	1
back	1
again,	1
and	1
then	1
they'd	1
be	1
sure	1
and	1
call	1
here."	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood	1
now	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
daughter;	1
but	1
Elinor	1
knew	1
better	1
than	1
to	1
expect	1
them.	1
She	1
recognised	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
Lucy	1
in	1
the	1
message,	1
and	1
was	1
very	1
confident	1
that	1
Edward	1
would	1
never	1
come	1
near	1
them.	1
She	1
observed	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice,	1
to	1
her	1
mother,	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
probably	1
going	1
down	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Pratt's,	1
near	1
Plymouth.	1
Thomas's	1
intelligence	1
seemed	1
over.	1
Elinor	1
looked	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
wished	1
to	1
hear	1
more.	1
"Did	1
you	1
see	1
them	1
off,	1
before	1
you	1
came	1
away?"	1
"No,	1
ma'am--the	1
horses	1
were	1
just	1
coming	1
out,	1
but	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
bide	1
any	1
longer;	1
I	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
being	1
late."	1
"Did	1
Mrs.	1
Ferrars	1
look	1
well?"	1
"Yes,	1
ma'am,	1
she	1
said	1
how	1
she	1
was	1
very	1
well;	1
and	1
to	1
my	1
mind	1
she	1
was	1
always	1
a	1
very	1
handsome	1
young	1
lady--and	1
she	1
seemed	1
vastly	1
contented."	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood	1
could	1
think	1
of	1
no	1
other	1
question,	1
and	1
Thomas	1
and	1
the	1
tablecloth,	1
now	1
alike	1
needless,	1
were	1
soon	1
afterwards	1
dismissed.	1
Marianne	1
had	1
already	1
sent	1
to	1
say,	1
that	1
she	1
should	1
eat	1
nothing	1
more.	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood's	1
and	1
Elinor's	1
appetites	1
were	1
equally	1
lost,	1
and	1
Margaret	1
might	1
think	1
herself	1
very	1
well	1
off,	1
that	1
with	1
so	1
much	1
uneasiness	1
as	1
both	1
her	1
sisters	1
had	1
lately	1
experienced,	1
so	1
much	1
reason	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
often	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
careless	1
of	1
their	1
meals,	1
she	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
obliged	1
to	1
go	1
without	1
her	1
dinner	1
before.	1
When	1
the	1
dessert	1
and	1
the	1
wine	1
were	1
arranged,	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood	1
and	1
Elinor	1
were	1
left	1
by	1
themselves,	1
they	1
remained	1
long	1
together	1
in	1
a	1
similarity	1
of	1
thoughtfulness	1
and	1
silence.	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood	1
feared	1
to	1
hazard	1
any	1
remark,	1
and	1
ventured	1
not	1
to	1
offer	1
consolation.	1
She	1
now	1
found	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
erred	1
in	1
relying	1
on	1
Elinor's	1
representation	1
of	1
herself;	1
and	1
justly	1
concluded	1
that	1
every	1
thing	1
had	1
been	1
expressly	1
softened	1
at	1
the	1
time,	1
to	1
spare	1
her	1
from	1
an	1
increase	1
of	1
unhappiness,	1
suffering	1
as	1
she	1
then	1
had	1
suffered	1
for	1
Marianne.	1
She	1
found	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
misled	1
by	1
the	1
careful,	1
the	1
considerate	1
attention	1
of	1
her	1
daughter,	1
to	1
think	1
the	1
attachment,	1
which	1
once	1
she	1
had	1
so	1
well	1
understood,	1
much	1
slighter	1
in	1
reality,	1
than	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
wont	1
to	1
believe,	1
or	1
than	1
it	1
was	1
now	1
proved	1
to	1
be.	1
She	1
feared	1
that	1
under	1
this	1
persuasion	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
unjust,	1
inattentive,	1
nay,	1
almost	1
unkind,	1
to	1
her	1
Elinor;--	1
that	1
Marianne's	1
affliction,	1
because	1
more	1
acknowledged,	1
more	1
immediately	1
before	1
her,	1
had	1
too	1
much	1
engrossed	1
her	1
tenderness,	1
and	1
led	1
her	1
away	1
to	1
forget	1
that	1
in	1
Elinor	1
she	1
might	1
have	1
a	1
daughter	1
suffering	1
almost	1
as	1
much,	1
certainly	1
with	1
less	1
self-provocation,	1
and	1
greater	1
fortitude.	1
CHAPTER	1
48	1
Elinor	1
now	1
found	1
the	1
difference	1
between	1
the	1
expectation	1
of	1
an	1
unpleasant	1
event,	1
however	1
certain	1
the	1
mind	1
may	1
be	1
told	1
to	1
consider	1
it,	1
and	1
certainty	1
itself.	1
She	1
now	1
found,	1
that	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
herself,	1
she	1
had	1
always	1
admitted	1
a	1
hope,	1
while	1
Edward	1
remained	1
single,	1
that	1
something	1
would	1
occur	1
to	1
prevent	1
his	1
marrying	1
Lucy;	1
that	1
some	1
resolution	1
of	1
his	1
own,	1
some	1
mediation	1
of	1
friends,	1
or	1
some	1
more	1
eligible	1
opportunity	1
of	1
establishment	1
for	1
the	1
lady,	1
would	1
arise	1
to	1
assist	1
the	1
happiness	1
of	1
all.	1
But	1
he	1
was	1
now	1
married;	1
and	1
she	1
condemned	1
her	1
heart	1
for	1
the	1
lurking	1
flattery,	1
which	1
so	1
much	1
heightened	1
the	1
pain	1
of	1
the	1
intelligence.	1
That	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
married	1
soon,	1
before	1
(as	1
she	1
imagined)	1
he	1
could	1
be	1
in	1
orders,	1
and	1
consequently	1
before	1
he	1
could	1
be	1
in	1
possession	1
of	1
the	1
living,	1
surprised	1
her	1
a	1
little	1
at	1
first.	1
But	1
she	1
soon	1
saw	1
how	1
likely	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
Lucy,	1
in	1
her	1
self-provident	1
care,	1
in	1
her	1
haste	1
to	1
secure	1
him,	1
should	1
overlook	1
every	1
thing	1
but	1
the	1
risk	1
of	1
delay.	1
They	1
were	1
married,	1
married	1
in	1
town,	1
and	1
now	1
hastening	1
down	1
to	1
her	1
uncle's.	1
What	1
had	1
Edward	1
felt	1
on	1
being	1
within	1
four	1
miles	1
from	1
Barton,	1
on	1
seeing	1
her	1
mother's	1
servant,	1
on	1
hearing	1
Lucy's	1
message!	1
They	1
would	1
soon,	1
she	1
supposed,	1
be	1
settled	1
at	1
Delaford.--Delaford,--that	1
place	1
in	1
which	1
so	1
much	1
conspired	1
to	1
give	1
her	1
an	1
interest;	1
which	1
she	1
wished	1
to	1
be	1
acquainted	1
with,	1
and	1
yet	1
desired	1
to	1
avoid.	1
She	1
saw	1
them	1
in	1
an	1
instant	1
in	1
their	1
parsonage-house;	1
saw	1
in	1
Lucy,	1
the	1
active,	1
contriving	1
manager,	1
uniting	1
at	1
once	1
a	1
desire	1
of	1
smart	1
appearance	1
with	1
the	1
utmost	1
frugality,	1
and	1
ashamed	1
to	1
be	1
suspected	1
of	1
half	1
her	1
economical	1
practices;--	1
pursuing	1
her	1
own	1
interest	1
in	1
every	1
thought,	1
courting	1
the	1
favour	1
of	1
Colonel	1
Brandon,	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings,	1
and	1
of	1
every	1
wealthy	1
friend.	1
In	1
Edward--she	1
knew	1
not	1
what	1
she	1
saw,	1
nor	1
what	1
she	1
wished	1
to	1
see;--happy	1
or	1
unhappy,--nothing	1
pleased	1
her;	1
she	1
turned	1
away	1
her	1
head	1
from	1
every	1
sketch	1
of	1
him.	1
Elinor	1
flattered	1
herself	1
that	1
some	1
one	1
of	1
their	1
connections	1
in	1
London	1
would	1
write	1
to	1
them	1
to	1
announce	1
the	1
event,	1
and	1
give	1
farther	1
particulars,--but	1
day	1
after	1
day	1
passed	1
off,	1
and	1
brought	1
no	1
letter,	1
no	1
tidings.	1
Though	1
uncertain	1
that	1
any	1
one	1
were	1
to	1
blame,	1
she	1
found	1
fault	1
with	1
every	1
absent	1
friend.	1
They	1
were	1
all	1
thoughtless	1
or	1
indolent.	1
"When	1
do	1
you	1
write	1
to	1
Colonel	1
Brandon,	1
ma'am?"	1
was	1
an	1
inquiry	1
which	1
sprung	1
from	1
the	1
impatience	1
of	1
her	1
mind	1
to	1
have	1
something	1
going	1
on.	1
"I	1
wrote	1
to	1
him,	1
my	1
love,	1
last	1
week,	1
and	1
rather	1
expect	1
to	1
see,	1
than	1
to	1
hear	1
from	1
him	1
again.	1
I	1
earnestly	1
pressed	1
his	1
coming	1
to	1
us,	1
and	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
surprised	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
walk	1
in	1
today	1
or	1
tomorrow,	1
or	1
any	1
day."	1
This	1
was	1
gaining	1
something,	1
something	1
to	1
look	1
forward	1
to.	1
Colonel	1
Brandon	1
must	1
have	1
some	1
information	1
to	1
give.	1
Scarcely	1
had	1
she	1
so	1
determined	1
it,	1
when	1
the	1
figure	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
on	1
horseback	1
drew	1
her	1
eyes	1
to	1
the	1
window.	1
He	1
stopt	1
at	1
their	1
gate.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
gentleman,	1
it	1
was	1
Colonel	1
Brandon	1
himself.	1
Now	1
she	1
could	1
hear	1
more;	1
and	1
she	1
trembled	1
in	1
expectation	1
of	1
it.	1
But--it	1
was	1
NOT	1
Colonel	1
Brandon--neither	1
his	1
air--nor	1
his	1
height.	1
Were	1
it	1
possible,	1
she	1
must	1
say	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
Edward.	1
She	1
looked	1
again.	1
He	1
had	1
just	1
dismounted;--she	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
mistaken,--it	1
WAS	1
Edward.	1
She	1
moved	1
away	1
and	1
sat	1
down.	1
"He	1
comes	1
from	1
Mr.	1
Pratt's	1
purposely	1
to	1
see	1
us.	1
I	1
WILL	1
be	1
calm;	1
I	1
WILL	1
be	1
mistress	1
of	1
myself."	1
In	1
a	1
moment	1
she	1
perceived	1
that	1
the	1
others	1
were	1
likewise	1
aware	1
of	1
the	1
mistake.	1
She	1
saw	1
her	1
mother	1
and	1
Marianne	1
change	1
colour;	1
saw	1
them	1
look	1
at	1
herself,	1
and	1
whisper	1
a	1
few	1
sentences	1
to	1
each	1
other.	1
She	1
would	1
have	1
given	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
speak--and	1
to	1
make	1
them	1
understand	1
that	1
she	1
hoped	1
no	1
coolness,	1
no	1
slight,	1
would	1
appear	1
in	1
their	1
behaviour	1
to	1
him;--but	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
utterance,	1
and	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
leave	1
all	1
to	1
their	1
own	1
discretion.	1
Not	1
a	1
syllable	1
passed	1
aloud.	1
They	1
all	1
waited	1
in	1
silence	1
for	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
their	1
visitor.	1
His	1
footsteps	1
were	1
heard	1
along	1
the	1
gravel	1
path;	1
in	1
a	1
moment	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
passage,	1
and	1
in	1
another	1
he	1
was	1
before	1
them.	1
His	1
countenance,	1
as	1
he	1
entered	1
the	1
room,	1
was	1
not	1
too	1
happy,	1
even	1
for	1
Elinor.	1
His	1
complexion	1
was	1
white	1
with	1
agitation,	1
and	1
he	1
looked	1
as	1
if	1
fearful	1
of	1
his	1
reception,	1
and	1
conscious	1
that	1
he	1
merited	1
no	1
kind	1
one.	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood,	1
however,	1
conforming,	1
as	1
she	1
trusted,	1
to	1
the	1
wishes	1
of	1
that	1
daughter,	1
by	1
whom	1
she	1
then	1
meant	1
in	1
the	1
warmth	1
of	1
her	1
heart	1
to	1
be	1
guided	1
in	1
every	1
thing,	1
met	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
forced	1
complacency,	1
gave	1
him	1
her	1
hand,	1
and	1
wished	1
him	1
joy.	1
He	1
coloured,	1
and	1
stammered	1
out	1
an	1
unintelligible	1
reply.	1
Elinor's	1
lips	1
had	1
moved	1
with	1
her	1
mother's,	1
and,	1
when	1
the	1
moment	1
of	1
action	1
was	1
over,	1
she	1
wished	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
shaken	1
hands	1
with	1
him	1
too.	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
then	1
too	1
late,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
countenance	1
meaning	1
to	1
be	1
open,	1
she	1
sat	1
down	1
again	1
and	1
talked	1
of	1
the	1
weather.	1
Marianne	1
had	1
retreated	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
possible	1
out	1
of	1
sight,	1
to	1
conceal	1
her	1
distress;	1
and	1
Margaret,	1
understanding	1
some	1
part,	1
but	1
not	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
the	1
case,	1
thought	1
it	1
incumbent	1
on	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
dignified,	1
and	1
therefore	1
took	1
a	1
seat	1
as	1
far	1
from	1
him	1
as	1
she	1
could,	1
and	1
maintained	1
a	1
strict	1
silence.	1
When	1
Elinor	1
had	1
ceased	1
to	1
rejoice	1
in	1
the	1
dryness	1
of	1
the	1
season,	1
a	1
very	1
awful	1
pause	1
took	1
place.	1
It	1
was	1
put	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
by	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood,	1
who	1
felt	1
obliged	1
to	1
hope	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
Mrs.	1
Ferrars	1
very	1
well.	1
In	1
a	1
hurried	1
manner,	1
he	1
replied	1
in	1
the	1
affirmative.	1
Another	1
pause.	1
Elinor	1
resolving	1
to	1
exert	1
herself,	1
though	1
fearing	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
voice,	1
now	1
said,	1
"Is	1
Mrs.	1
Ferrars	1
at	1
Longstaple?"	1
"At	1
Longstaple!"	1
he	1
replied,	1
with	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
surprise.--	1
"No,	1
my	1
mother	1
is	1
in	1
town."	1
"I	1
meant,"	1
said	1
Elinor,	1
taking	1
up	1
some	1
work	1
from	1
the	1
table,	1
"to	1
inquire	1
for	1
Mrs.	1
EDWARD	1
Ferrars."	1
She	1
dared	1
not	1
look	1
up;--but	1
her	1
mother	1
and	1
Marianne	1
both	1
turned	1
their	1
eyes	1
on	1
him.	1
He	1
coloured,	1
seemed	1
perplexed,	1
looked	1
doubtingly,	1
and,	1
after	1
some	1
hesitation,	1
said,--	1
"Perhaps	1
you	1
mean--my	1
brother--you	1
mean	1
Mrs.--Mrs.	1
ROBERT	1
Ferrars."	1
"Mrs.	1
Robert	1
Ferrars!"--was	1
repeated	1
by	1
Marianne	1
and	1
her	1
mother	1
in	1
an	1
accent	1
of	1
the	1
utmost	1
amazement;--and	1
though	1
Elinor	1
could	1
not	1
speak,	1
even	1
HER	1
eyes	1
were	1
fixed	1
on	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
impatient	1
wonder.	1
He	1
rose	1
from	1
his	1
seat,	1
and	1
walked	1
to	1
the	1
window,	1
apparently	1
from	1
not	1
knowing	1
what	1
to	1
do;	1
took	1
up	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
scissors	1
that	1
lay	1
there,	1
and	1
while	1
spoiling	1
both	1
them	1
and	1
their	1
sheath	1
by	1
cutting	1
the	1
latter	1
to	1
pieces	1
as	1
he	1
spoke,	1
said,	1
in	1
a	1
hurried	1
voice,	1
"Perhaps	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
know--you	1
may	1
not	1
have	1
heard	1
that	1
my	1
brother	1
is	1
lately	1
married	1
to--to	1
the	1
youngest--to	1
Miss	1
Lucy	1
Steele."	1
His	1
words	1
were	1
echoed	1
with	1
unspeakable	1
astonishment	1
by	1
all	1
but	1
Elinor,	1
who	1
sat	1
with	1
her	1
head	1
leaning	1
over	1
her	1
work,	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
such	1
agitation	1
as	1
made	1
her	1
hardly	1
know	1
where	1
she	1
was.	1
"Yes,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"they	1
were	1
married	1
last	1
week,	1
and	1
are	1
now	1
at	1
Dawlish."	1
Elinor	1
could	1
sit	1
it	1
no	1
longer.	1
She	1
almost	1
ran	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room,	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
door	1
was	1
closed,	1
burst	1
into	1
tears	1
of	1
joy,	1
which	1
at	1
first	1
she	1
thought	1
would	1
never	1
cease.	1
Edward,	1
who	1
had	1
till	1
then	1
looked	1
any	1
where,	1
rather	1
than	1
at	1
her,	1
saw	1
her	1
hurry	1
away,	1
and	1
perhaps	1
saw--	1
or	1
even	1
heard,	1
her	1
emotion;	1
for	1
immediately	1
afterwards	1
he	1
fell	1
into	1
a	1
reverie,	1
which	1
no	1
remarks,	1
no	1
inquiries,	1
no	1
affectionate	1
address	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood	1
could	1
penetrate,	1
and	1
at	1
last,	1
without	1
saying	1
a	1
word,	1
quitted	1
the	1
room,	1
and	1
walked	1
out	1
towards	1
the	1
village--leaving	1
the	1
others	1
in	1
the	1
greatest	1
astonishment	1
and	1
perplexity	1
on	1
a	1
change	1
in	1
his	1
situation,	1
so	1
wonderful	1
and	1
so	1
sudden;--a	1
perplexity	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
no	1
means	1
of	1
lessening	1
but	1
by	1
their	1
own	1
conjectures.	1
CHAPTER	1
49	1
Unaccountable,	1
however,	1
as	1
the	1
circumstances	1
of	1
his	1
release	1
might	1
appear	1
to	1
the	1
whole	1
family,	1
it	1
was	1
certain	1
that	1
Edward	1
was	1
free;	1
and	1
to	1
what	1
purpose	1
that	1
freedom	1
would	1
be	1
employed	1
was	1
easily	1
pre-determined	1
by	1
all;--for	1
after	1
experiencing	1
the	1
blessings	1
of	1
ONE	1
imprudent	1
engagement,	1
contracted	1
without	1
his	1
mother's	1
consent,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
done	1
for	1
more	1
than	1
four	1
years,	1
nothing	1
less	1
could	1
be	1
expected	1
of	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
failure	1
of	1
THAT,	1
than	1
the	1
immediate	1
contraction	1
of	1
another.	1
His	1
errand	1
at	1
Barton,	1
in	1
fact,	1
was	1
a	1
simple	1
one.	1
It	1
was	1
only	1
to	1
ask	1
Elinor	1
to	1
marry	1
him;--and	1
considering	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
altogether	1
inexperienced	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
question,	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
strange	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
feel	1
so	1
uncomfortable	1
in	1
the	1
present	1
case	1
as	1
he	1
really	1
did,	1
so	1
much	1
in	1
need	1
of	1
encouragement	1
and	1
fresh	1
air.	1
How	1
soon	1
he	1
had	1
walked	1
himself	1
into	1
the	1
proper	1
resolution,	1
however,	1
how	1
soon	1
an	1
opportunity	1
of	1
exercising	1
it	1
occurred,	1
in	1
what	1
manner	1
he	1
expressed	1
himself,	1
and	1
how	1
he	1
was	1
received,	1
need	1
not	1
be	1
particularly	1
told.	1
This	1
only	1
need	1
be	1
said;--that	1
when	1
they	1
all	1
sat	1
down	1
to	1
table	1
at	1
four	1
o'clock,	1
about	1
three	1
hours	1
after	1
his	1
arrival,	1
he	1
had	1
secured	1
his	1
lady,	1
engaged	1
her	1
mother's	1
consent,	1
and	1
was	1
not	1
only	1
in	1
the	1
rapturous	1
profession	1
of	1
the	1
lover,	1
but,	1
in	1
the	1
reality	1
of	1
reason	1
and	1
truth,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
happiest	1
of	1
men.	1
His	1
situation	1
indeed	1
was	1
more	1
than	1
commonly	1
joyful.	1
He	1
had	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
ordinary	1
triumph	1
of	1
accepted	1
love	1
to	1
swell	1
his	1
heart,	1
and	1
raise	1
his	1
spirits.	1
He	1
was	1
released	1
without	1
any	1
reproach	1
to	1
himself,	1
from	1
an	1
entanglement	1
which	1
had	1
long	1
formed	1
his	1
misery,	1
from	1
a	1
woman	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
long	1
ceased	1
to	1
love;--	1
and	1
elevated	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
that	1
security	1
with	1
another,	1
which	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
thought	1
of	1
almost	1
with	1
despair,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
learnt	1
to	1
consider	1
it	1
with	1
desire.	1
He	1
was	1
brought,	1
not	1
from	1
doubt	1
or	1
suspense,	1
but	1
from	1
misery	1
to	1
happiness;--and	1
the	1
change	1
was	1
openly	1
spoken	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
genuine,	1
flowing,	1
grateful	1
cheerfulness,	1
as	1
his	1
friends	1
had	1
never	1
witnessed	1
in	1
him	1
before.	1
His	1
heart	1
was	1
now	1
open	1
to	1
Elinor,	1
all	1
its	1
weaknesses,	1
all	1
its	1
errors	1
confessed,	1
and	1
his	1
first	1
boyish	1
attachment	1
to	1
Lucy	1
treated	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
philosophic	1
dignity	1
of	1
twenty-four.	1
"It	1
was	1
a	1
foolish,	1
idle	1
inclination	1
on	1
my	1
side,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"the	1
consequence	1
of	1
ignorance	1
of	1
the	1
world--	1
and	1
want	1
of	1
employment.	1
Had	1
my	1
brother	1
given	1
me	1
some	1
active	1
profession	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
removed	1
at	1
eighteen	1
from	1
the	1
care	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Pratt,	1
I	1
think--nay,	1
I	1
am	1
sure,	1
it	1
would	1
never	1
have	1
happened;	1
for	1
though	1
I	1
left	1
Longstaple	1
with	1
what	1
I	1
thought,	1
at	1
the	1
time,	1
a	1
most	1
unconquerable	1
preference	1
for	1
his	1
niece,	1
yet	1
had	1
I	1
then	1
had	1
any	1
pursuit,	1
any	1
object	1
to	1
engage	1
my	1
time	1
and	1
keep	1
me	1
at	1
a	1
distance	1
from	1
her	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
months,	1
I	1
should	1
very	1
soon	1
have	1
outgrown	1
the	1
fancied	1
attachment,	1
especially	1
by	1
mixing	1
more	1
with	1
the	1
world,	1
as	1
in	1
such	1
case	1
I	1
must	1
have	1
done.	1
But	1
instead	1
of	1
having	1
any	1
thing	1
to	1
do,	1
instead	1
of	1
having	1
any	1
profession	1
chosen	1
for	1
me,	1
or	1
being	1
allowed	1
to	1
chuse	1
any	1
myself,	1
I	1
returned	1
home	1
to	1
be	1
completely	1
idle;	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
twelvemonth	1
afterwards	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
even	1
the	1
nominal	1
employment,	1
which	1
belonging	1
to	1
the	1
university	1
would	1
have	1
given	1
me;	1
for	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
entered	1
at	1
Oxford	1
till	1
I	1
was	1
nineteen.	1
I	1
had	1
therefore	1
nothing	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
do,	1
but	1
to	1
fancy	1
myself	1
in	1
love;	1
and	1
as	1
my	1
mother	1
did	1
not	1
make	1
my	1
home	1
in	1
every	1
respect	1
comfortable,	1
as	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
friend,	1
no	1
companion	1
in	1
my	1
brother,	1
and	1
disliked	1
new	1
acquaintance,	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
unnatural	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
very	1
often	1
at	1
Longstaple,	1
where	1
I	1
always	1
felt	1
myself	1
at	1
home,	1
and	1
was	1
always	1
sure	1
of	1
a	1
welcome;	1
and	1
accordingly	1
I	1
spent	1
the	1
greatest	1
part	1
of	1
my	1
time	1
there	1
from	1
eighteen	1
to	1
nineteen:	1
Lucy	1
appeared	1
everything	1
that	1
was	1
amiable	1
and	1
obliging.	1
She	1
was	1
pretty	1
too--at	1
least	1
I	1
thought	1
so	1
THEN;	1
and	1
I	1
had	1
seen	1
so	1
little	1
of	1
other	1
women,	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
make	1
no	1
comparisons,	1
and	1
see	1
no	1
defects.	1
Considering	1
everything,	1
therefore,	1
I	1
hope,	1
foolish	1
as	1
our	1
engagement	1
was,	1
foolish	1
as	1
it	1
has	1
since	1
in	1
every	1
way	1
been	1
proved,	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
an	1
unnatural	1
or	1
an	1
inexcusable	1
piece	1
of	1
folly."	1
The	1
change	1
which	1
a	1
few	1
hours	1
had	1
wrought	1
in	1
the	1
minds	1
and	1
the	1
happiness	1
of	1
the	1
Dashwoods,	1
was	1
such--so	1
great--as	1
promised	1
them	1
all,	1
the	1
satisfaction	1
of	1
a	1
sleepless	1
night.	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood,	1
too	1
happy	1
to	1
be	1
comfortable,	1
knew	1
not	1
how	1
to	1
love	1
Edward,	1
nor	1
praise	1
Elinor	1
enough,	1
how	1
to	1
be	1
enough	1
thankful	1
for	1
his	1
release	1
without	1
wounding	1
his	1
delicacy,	1
nor	1
how	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
give	1
them	1
leisure	1
for	1
unrestrained	1
conversation	1
together,	1
and	1
yet	1
enjoy,	1
as	1
she	1
wished,	1
the	1
sight	1
and	1
society	1
of	1
both.	1
Marianne	1
could	1
speak	1
HER	1
happiness	1
only	1
by	1
tears.	1
Comparisons	1
would	1
occur--regrets	1
would	1
arise;--and	1
her	1
joy,	1
though	1
sincere	1
as	1
her	1
love	1
for	1
her	1
sister,	1
was	1
of	1
a	1
kind	1
to	1
give	1
her	1
neither	1
spirits	1
nor	1
language.	1
But	1
Elinor--how	1
are	1
HER	1
feelings	1
to	1
be	1
described?--From	1
the	1
moment	1
of	1
learning	1
that	1
Lucy	1
was	1
married	1
to	1
another,	1
that	1
Edward	1
was	1
free,	1
to	1
the	1
moment	1
of	1
his	1
justifying	1
the	1
hopes	1
which	1
had	1
so	1
instantly	1
followed,	1
she	1
was	1
every	1
thing	1
by	1
turns	1
but	1
tranquil.	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
second	1
moment	1
had	1
passed,	1
when	1
she	1
found	1
every	1
doubt,	1
every	1
solicitude	1
removed,	1
compared	1
her	1
situation	1
with	1
what	1
so	1
lately	1
it	1
had	1
been,--saw	1
him	1
honourably	1
released	1
from	1
his	1
former	1
engagement,	1
saw	1
him	1
instantly	1
profiting	1
by	1
the	1
release,	1
to	1
address	1
herself	1
and	1
declare	1
an	1
affection	1
as	1
tender,	1
as	1
constant	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
ever	1
supposed	1
it	1
to	1
be,--she	1
was	1
oppressed,	1
she	1
was	1
overcome	1
by	1
her	1
own	1
felicity;--	1
and	1
happily	1
disposed	1
as	1
is	1
the	1
human	1
mind	1
to	1
be	1
easily	1
familiarized	1
with	1
any	1
change	1
for	1
the	1
better,	1
it	1
required	1
several	1
hours	1
to	1
give	1
sedateness	1
to	1
her	1
spirits,	1
or	1
any	1
degree	1
of	1
tranquillity	1
to	1
her	1
heart.	1
Edward	1
was	1
now	1
fixed	1
at	1
the	1
cottage	1
at	1
least	1
for	1
a	1
week;--for	1
whatever	1
other	1
claims	1
might	1
be	1
made	1
on	1
him,	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
that	1
less	1
than	1
a	1
week	1
should	1
be	1
given	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
enjoyment	1
of	1
Elinor's	1
company,	1
or	1
suffice	1
to	1
say	1
half	1
that	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
said	1
of	1
the	1
past,	1
the	1
present,	1
and	1
the	1
future;--for	1
though	1
a	1
very	1
few	1
hours	1
spent	1
in	1
the	1
hard	1
labor	1
of	1
incessant	1
talking	1
will	1
despatch	1
more	1
subjects	1
than	1
can	1
really	1
be	1
in	1
common	1
between	1
any	1
two	1
rational	1
creatures,	1
yet	1
with	1
lovers	1
it	1
is	1
different.	1
Between	1
THEM	1
no	1
subject	1
is	1
finished,	1
no	1
communication	1
is	1
even	1
made,	1
till	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
made	1
at	1
least	1
twenty	1
times	1
over.	1
Lucy's	1
marriage,	1
the	1
unceasing	1
and	1
reasonable	1
wonder	1
among	1
them	1
all,	1
formed	1
of	1
course	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
earliest	1
discussions	1
of	1
the	1
lovers;--and	1
Elinor's	1
particular	1
knowledge	1
of	1
each	1
party	1
made	1
it	1
appear	1
to	1
her	1
in	1
every	1
view,	1
as	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
extraordinary	1
and	1
unaccountable	1
circumstances	1
she	1
had	1
ever	1
heard.	1
How	1
they	1
could	1
be	1
thrown	1
together,	1
and	1
by	1
what	1
attraction	1
Robert	1
could	1
be	1
drawn	1
on	1
to	1
marry	1
a	1
girl,	1
of	1
whose	1
beauty	1
she	1
had	1
herself	1
heard	1
him	1
speak	1
without	1
any	1
admiration,--a	1
girl	1
too	1
already	1
engaged	1
to	1
his	1
brother,	1
and	1
on	1
whose	1
account	1
that	1
brother	1
had	1
been	1
thrown	1
off	1
by	1
his	1
family--it	1
was	1
beyond	1
her	1
comprehension	1
to	1
make	1
out.	1
To	1
her	1
own	1
heart	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
delightful	1
affair,	1
to	1
her	1
imagination	1
it	1
was	1
even	1
a	1
ridiculous	1
one,	1
but	1
to	1
her	1
reason,	1
her	1
judgment,	1
it	1
was	1
completely	1
a	1
puzzle.	1
Edward	1
could	1
only	1
attempt	1
an	1
explanation	1
by	1
supposing,	1
that,	1
perhaps,	1
at	1
first	1
accidentally	1
meeting,	1
the	1
vanity	1
of	1
the	1
one	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
worked	1
on	1
by	1
the	1
flattery	1
of	1
the	1
other,	1
as	1
to	1
lead	1
by	1
degrees	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
rest.	1
Elinor	1
remembered	1
what	1
Robert	1
had	1
told	1
her	1
in	1
Harley	1
Street,	1
of	1
his	1
opinion	1
of	1
what	1
his	1
own	1
mediation	1
in	1
his	1
brother's	1
affairs	1
might	1
have	1
done,	1
if	1
applied	1
to	1
in	1
time.	1
She	1
repeated	1
it	1
to	1
Edward.	1
"THAT	1
was	1
exactly	1
like	1
Robert,"--was	1
his	1
immediate	1
observation.--"And	1
THAT,"	1
he	1
presently	1
added,	1
"might	1
perhaps	1
be	1
in	1
HIS	1
head	1
when	1
the	1
acquaintance	1
between	1
them	1
first	1
began.	1
And	1
Lucy	1
perhaps	1
at	1
first	1
might	1
think	1
only	1
of	1
procuring	1
his	1
good	1
offices	1
in	1
my	1
favour.	1
Other	1
designs	1
might	1
afterward	1
arise."	1
How	1
long	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
carrying	1
on	1
between	1
them,	1
however,	1
he	1
was	1
equally	1
at	1
a	1
loss	1
with	1
herself	1
to	1
make	1
out;	1
for	1
at	1
Oxford,	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
remained	1
for	1
choice	1
ever	1
since	1
his	1
quitting	1
London,	1
he	1
had	1
had	1
no	1
means	1
of	1
hearing	1
of	1
her	1
but	1
from	1
herself,	1
and	1
her	1
letters	1
to	1
the	1
very	1
last	1
were	1
neither	1
less	1
frequent,	1
nor	1
less	1
affectionate	1
than	1
usual.	1
Not	1
the	1
smallest	1
suspicion,	1
therefore,	1
had	1
ever	1
occurred	1
to	1
prepare	1
him	1
for	1
what	1
followed;--and	1
when	1
at	1
last	1
it	1
burst	1
on	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
Lucy	1
herself,	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
for	1
some	1
time,	1
he	1
believed,	1
half	1
stupified	1
between	1
the	1
wonder,	1
the	1
horror,	1
and	1
the	1
joy	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
deliverance.	1
He	1
put	1
the	1
letter	1
into	1
Elinor's	1
hands.	1
"DEAR	1
SIR,	1
"Being	1
very	1
sure	1
I	1
have	1
long	1
lost	1
your	1
affections,	1
I	1
have	1
thought	1
myself	1
at	1
liberty	1
to	1
bestow	1
my	1
own	1
on	1
another,	1
and	1
have	1
no	1
doubt	1
of	1
being	1
as	1
happy	1
with	1
him	1
as	1
I	1
once	1
used	1
to	1
think	1
I	1
might	1
be	1
with	1
you;	1
but	1
I	1
scorn	1
to	1
accept	1
a	1
hand	1
while	1
the	1
heart	1
was	1
another's.	1
Sincerely	1
wish	1
you	1
happy	1
in	1
your	1
choice,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
my	1
fault	1
if	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
always	1
good	1
friends,	1
as	1
our	1
near	1
relationship	1
now	1
makes	1
proper.	1
I	1
can	1
safely	1
say	1
I	1
owe	1
you	1
no	1
ill-will,	1
and	1
am	1
sure	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
too	1
generous	1
to	1
do	1
us	1
any	1
ill	1
offices.	1
Your	1
brother	1
has	1
gained	1
my	1
affections	1
entirely,	1
and	1
as	1
we	1
could	1
not	1
live	1
without	1
one	1
another,	1
we	1
are	1
just	1
returned	1
from	1
the	1
altar,	1
and	1
are	1
now	1
on	1
our	1
way	1
to	1
Dawlish	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
weeks,	1
which	1
place	1
your	1
dear	1
brother	1
has	1
great	1
curiosity	1
to	1
see,	1
but	1
thought	1
I	1
would	1
first	1
trouble	1
you	1
with	1
these	1
few	1
lines,	1
and	1
shall	1
always	1
remain,	1
"Your	1
sincere	1
well-wisher,	1
friend,	1
and	1
sister,	1
"LUCY	1
FERRARS.	1
"I	1
have	1
burnt	1
all	1
your	1
letters,	1
and	1
will	1
return	1
your	1
picture	1
the	1
first	1
opportunity.	1
Please	1
to	1
destroy	1
my	1
scrawls--but	1
the	1
ring	1
with	1
my	1
hair	1
you	1
are	1
very	1
welcome	1
to	1
keep."	1
Elinor	1
read	1
and	1
returned	1
it	1
without	1
any	1
comment.	1
"I	1
will	1
not	1
ask	1
your	1
opinion	1
of	1
it	1
as	1
a	1
composition,"	1
said	1
Edward.--"For	1
worlds	1
would	1
not	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
a	1
letter	1
of	1
hers	1
seen	1
by	1
YOU	1
in	1
former	1
days.--In	1
a	1
sister	1
it	1
is	1
bad	1
enough,	1
but	1
in	1
a	1
wife!--how	1
I	1
have	1
blushed	1
over	1
the	1
pages	1
of	1
her	1
writing!--and	1
I	1
believe	1
I	1
may	1
say	1
that	1
since	1
the	1
first	1
half	1
year	1
of	1
our	1
foolish--business--this	1
is	1
the	1
only	1
letter	1
I	1
ever	1
received	1
from	1
her,	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
substance	1
made	1
me	1
any	1
amends	1
for	1
the	1
defect	1
of	1
the	1
style."	1
"However	1
it	1
may	1
have	1
come	1
about,"	1
said	1
Elinor,	1
after	1
a	1
pause,--"they	1
are	1
certainly	1
married.	1
And	1
your	1
mother	1
has	1
brought	1
on	1
herself	1
a	1
most	1
appropriate	1
punishment.	1
The	1
independence	1
she	1
settled	1
on	1
Robert,	1
through	1
resentment	1
against	1
you,	1
has	1
put	1
it	1
in	1
his	1
power	1
to	1
make	1
his	1
own	1
choice;	1
and	1
she	1
has	1
actually	1
been	1
bribing	1
one	1
son	1
with	1
a	1
thousand	1
a-year,	1
to	1
do	1
the	1
very	1
deed	1
which	1
she	1
disinherited	1
the	1
other	1
for	1
intending	1
to	1
do.	1
She	1
will	1
hardly	1
be	1
less	1
hurt,	1
I	1
suppose,	1
by	1
Robert's	1
marrying	1
Lucy,	1
than	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
by	1
your	1
marrying	1
her."	1
"She	1
will	1
be	1
more	1
hurt	1
by	1
it,	1
for	1
Robert	1
always	1
was	1
her	1
favourite.--She	1
will	1
be	1
more	1
hurt	1
by	1
it,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
principle	1
will	1
forgive	1
him	1
much	1
sooner."	1
In	1
what	1
state	1
the	1
affair	1
stood	1
at	1
present	1
between	1
them,	1
Edward	1
knew	1
not,	1
for	1
no	1
communication	1
with	1
any	1
of	1
his	1
family	1
had	1
yet	1
been	1
attempted	1
by	1
him.	1
He	1
had	1
quitted	1
Oxford	1
within	1
four	1
and	1
twenty	1
hours	1
after	1
Lucy's	1
letter	1
arrived,	1
and	1
with	1
only	1
one	1
object	1
before	1
him,	1
the	1
nearest	1
road	1
to	1
Barton,	1
had	1
had	1
no	1
leisure	1
to	1
form	1
any	1
scheme	1
of	1
conduct,	1
with	1
which	1
that	1
road	1
did	1
not	1
hold	1
the	1
most	1
intimate	1
connection.	1
He	1
could	1
do	1
nothing	1
till	1
he	1
were	1
assured	1
of	1
his	1
fate	1
with	1
Miss	1
Dashwood;	1
and	1
by	1
his	1
rapidity	1
in	1
seeking	1
THAT	1
fate,	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
supposed,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
jealousy	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
once	1
thought	1
of	1
Colonel	1
Brandon,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
modesty	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
rated	1
his	1
own	1
deserts,	1
and	1
the	1
politeness	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
talked	1
of	1
his	1
doubts,	1
he	1
did	1
not,	1
upon	1
the	1
whole,	1
expect	1
a	1
very	1
cruel	1
reception.	1
It	1
was	1
his	1
business,	1
however,	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
he	1
DID,	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
it	1
very	1
prettily.	1
What	1
he	1
might	1
say	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
a	1
twelvemonth	1
after,	1
must	1
be	1
referred	1
to	1
the	1
imagination	1
of	1
husbands	1
and	1
wives.	1
That	1
Lucy	1
had	1
certainly	1
meant	1
to	1
deceive,	1
to	1
go	1
off	1
with	1
a	1
flourish	1
of	1
malice	1
against	1
him	1
in	1
her	1
message	1
by	1
Thomas,	1
was	1
perfectly	1
clear	1
to	1
Elinor;	1
and	1
Edward	1
himself,	1
now	1
thoroughly	1
enlightened	1
on	1
her	1
character,	1
had	1
no	1
scruple	1
in	1
believing	1
her	1
capable	1
of	1
the	1
utmost	1
meanness	1
of	1
wanton	1
ill-nature.	1
Though	1
his	1
eyes	1
had	1
been	1
long	1
opened,	1
even	1
before	1
his	1
acquaintance	1
with	1
Elinor	1
began,	1
to	1
her	1
ignorance	1
and	1
a	1
want	1
of	1
liberality	1
in	1
some	1
of	1
her	1
opinions--	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
equally	1
imputed,	1
by	1
him,	1
to	1
her	1
want	1
of	1
education;	1
and	1
till	1
her	1
last	1
letter	1
reached	1
him,	1
he	1
had	1
always	1
believed	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
well-disposed,	1
good-hearted	1
girl,	1
and	1
thoroughly	1
attached	1
to	1
himself.	1
Nothing	1
but	1
such	1
a	1
persuasion	1
could	1
have	1
prevented	1
his	1
putting	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
an	1
engagement,	1
which,	1
long	1
before	1
the	1
discovery	1
of	1
it	1
laid	1
him	1
open	1
to	1
his	1
mother's	1
anger,	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
continual	1
source	1
of	1
disquiet	1
and	1
regret	1
to	1
him.	1
"I	1
thought	1
it	1
my	1
duty,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"independent	1
of	1
my	1
feelings,	1
to	1
give	1
her	1
the	1
option	1
of	1
continuing	1
the	1
engagement	1
or	1
not,	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
renounced	1
by	1
my	1
mother,	1
and	1
stood	1
to	1
all	1
appearance	1
without	1
a	1
friend	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
assist	1
me.	1
In	1
such	1
a	1
situation	1
as	1
that,	1
where	1
there	1
seemed	1
nothing	1
to	1
tempt	1
the	1
avarice	1
or	1
the	1
vanity	1
of	1
any	1
living	1
creature,	1
how	1
could	1
I	1
suppose,	1
when	1
she	1
so	1
earnestly,	1
so	1
warmly	1
insisted	1
on	1
sharing	1
my	1
fate,	1
whatever	1
it	1
might	1
be,	1
that	1
any	1
thing	1
but	1
the	1
most	1
disinterested	1
affection	1
was	1
her	1
inducement?	1
And	1
even	1
now,	1
I	1
cannot	1
comprehend	1
on	1
what	1
motive	1
she	1
acted,	1
or	1
what	1
fancied	1
advantage	1
it	1
could	1
be	1
to	1
her,	1
to	1
be	1
fettered	1
to	1
a	1
man	1
for	1
whom	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
smallest	1
regard,	1
and	1
who	1
had	1
only	1
two	1
thousand	1
pounds	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
foresee	1
that	1
Colonel	1
Brandon	1
would	1
give	1
me	1
a	1
living."	1
"No;	1
but	1
she	1
might	1
suppose	1
that	1
something	1
would	1
occur	1
in	1
your	1
favour;	1
that	1
your	1
own	1
family	1
might	1
in	1
time	1
relent.	1
And	1
at	1
any	1
rate,	1
she	1
lost	1
nothing	1
by	1
continuing	1
the	1
engagement,	1
for	1
she	1
has	1
proved	1
that	1
it	1
fettered	1
neither	1
her	1
inclination	1
nor	1
her	1
actions.	1
The	1
connection	1
was	1
certainly	1
a	1
respectable	1
one,	1
and	1
probably	1
gained	1
her	1
consideration	1
among	1
her	1
friends;	1
and,	1
if	1
nothing	1
more	1
advantageous	1
occurred,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
better	1
for	1
her	1
to	1
marry	1
YOU	1
than	1
be	1
single."	1
Edward	1
was,	1
of	1
course,	1
immediately	1
convinced	1
that	1
nothing	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
more	1
natural	1
than	1
Lucy's	1
conduct,	1
nor	1
more	1
self-evident	1
than	1
the	1
motive	1
of	1
it.	1
Elinor	1
scolded	1
him,	1
harshly	1
as	1
ladies	1
always	1
scold	1
the	1
imprudence	1
which	1
compliments	1
themselves,	1
for	1
having	1
spent	1
so	1
much	1
time	1
with	1
them	1
at	1
Norland,	1
when	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
felt	1
his	1
own	1
inconstancy.	1
"Your	1
behaviour	1
was	1
certainly	1
very	1
wrong,"	1
said	1
she;	1
"because--to	1
say	1
nothing	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
conviction,	1
our	1
relations	1
were	1
all	1
led	1
away	1
by	1
it	1
to	1
fancy	1
and	1
expect	1
WHAT,	1
as	1
you	1
were	1
THEN	1
situated,	1
could	1
never	1
be."	1
He	1
could	1
only	1
plead	1
an	1
ignorance	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
heart,	1
and	1
a	1
mistaken	1
confidence	1
in	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
his	1
engagement.	1
"I	1
was	1
simple	1
enough	1
to	1
think,	1
that	1
because	1
my	1
FAITH	1
was	1
plighted	1
to	1
another,	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
no	1
danger	1
in	1
my	1
being	1
with	1
you;	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
consciousness	1
of	1
my	1
engagement	1
was	1
to	1
keep	1
my	1
heart	1
as	1
safe	1
and	1
sacred	1
as	1
my	1
honour.	1
I	1
felt	1
that	1
I	1
admired	1
you,	1
but	1
I	1
told	1
myself	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
friendship;	1
and	1
till	1
I	1
began	1
to	1
make	1
comparisons	1
between	1
yourself	1
and	1
Lucy,	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
far	1
I	1
was	1
got.	1
After	1
that,	1
I	1
suppose,	1
I	1
WAS	1
wrong	1
in	1
remaining	1
so	1
much	1
in	1
Sussex,	1
and	1
the	1
arguments	1
with	1
which	1
I	1
reconciled	1
myself	1
to	1
the	1
expediency	1
of	1
it,	1
were	1
no	1
better	1
than	1
these:--The	1
danger	1
is	1
my	1
own;	1
I	1
am	1
doing	1
no	1
injury	1
to	1
anybody	1
but	1
myself."	1
Elinor	1
smiled,	1
and	1
shook	1
her	1
head.	1
Edward	1
heard	1
with	1
pleasure	1
of	1
Colonel	1
Brandon's	1
being	1
expected	1
at	1
the	1
Cottage,	1
as	1
he	1
really	1
wished	1
not	1
only	1
to	1
be	1
better	1
acquainted	1
with	1
him,	1
but	1
to	1
have	1
an	1
opportunity	1
of	1
convincing	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
no	1
longer	1
resented	1
his	1
giving	1
him	1
the	1
living	1
of	1
Delaford--"Which,	1
at	1
present,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"after	1
thanks	1
so	1
ungraciously	1
delivered	1
as	1
mine	1
were	1
on	1
the	1
occasion,	1
he	1
must	1
think	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
forgiven	1
him	1
for	1
offering."	1
NOW	1
he	1
felt	1
astonished	1
himself	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
yet	1
been	1
to	1
the	1
place.	1
But	1
so	1
little	1
interest	1
had	1
be	1
taken	1
in	1
the	1
matter,	1
that	1
he	1
owed	1
all	1
his	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
garden,	1
and	1
glebe,	1
extent	1
of	1
the	1
parish,	1
condition	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
rate	1
of	1
the	1
tithes,	1
to	1
Elinor	1
herself,	1
who	1
had	1
heard	1
so	1
much	1
of	1
it	1
from	1
Colonel	1
Brandon,	1
and	1
heard	1
it	1
with	1
so	1
much	1
attention,	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
entirely	1
mistress	1
of	1
the	1
subject.	1
One	1
question	1
after	1
this	1
only	1
remained	1
undecided,	1
between	1
them,	1
one	1
difficulty	1
only	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
overcome.	1
They	1
were	1
brought	1
together	1
by	1
mutual	1
affection,	1
with	1
the	1
warmest	1
approbation	1
of	1
their	1
real	1
friends;	1
their	1
intimate	1
knowledge	1
of	1
each	1
other	1
seemed	1
to	1
make	1
their	1
happiness	1
certain--and	1
they	1
only	1
wanted	1
something	1
to	1
live	1
upon.	1
Edward	1
had	1
two	1
thousand	1
pounds,	1
and	1
Elinor	1
one,	1
which,	1
with	1
Delaford	1
living,	1
was	1
all	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
call	1
their	1
own;	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
that	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood	1
should	1
advance	1
anything;	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
neither	1
of	1
them	1
quite	1
enough	1
in	1
love	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
three	1
hundred	1
and	1
fifty	1
pounds	1
a-year	1
would	1
supply	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
comforts	1
of	1
life.	1
Edward	1
was	1
not	1
entirely	1
without	1
hopes	1
of	1
some	1
favourable	1
change	1
in	1
his	1
mother	1
towards	1
him;	1
and	1
on	1
THAT	1
he	1
rested	1
for	1
the	1
residue	1
of	1
their	1
income.	1
But	1
Elinor	1
had	1
no	1
such	1
dependence;	1
for	1
since	1
Edward	1
would	1
still	1
be	1
unable	1
to	1
marry	1
Miss	1
Morton,	1
and	1
his	1
chusing	1
herself	1
had	1
been	1
spoken	1
of	1
in	1
Mrs.	1
Ferrars's	1
flattering	1
language	1
as	1
only	1
a	1
lesser	1
evil	1
than	1
his	1
chusing	1
Lucy	1
Steele,	1
she	1
feared	1
that	1
Robert's	1
offence	1
would	1
serve	1
no	1
other	1
purpose	1
than	1
to	1
enrich	1
Fanny.	1
About	1
four	1
days	1
after	1
Edward's	1
arrival	1
Colonel	1
Brandon	1
appeared,	1
to	1
complete	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood's	1
satisfaction,	1
and	1
to	1
give	1
her	1
the	1
dignity	1
of	1
having,	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
since	1
her	1
living	1
at	1
Barton,	1
more	1
company	1
with	1
her	1
than	1
her	1
house	1
would	1
hold.	1
Edward	1
was	1
allowed	1
to	1
retain	1
the	1
privilege	1
of	1
first	1
comer,	1
and	1
Colonel	1
Brandon	1
therefore	1
walked	1
every	1
night	1
to	1
his	1
old	1
quarters	1
at	1
the	1
Park;	1
from	1
whence	1
he	1
usually	1
returned	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
early	1
enough	1
to	1
interrupt	1
the	1
lovers'	1
first	1
tete-a-tete	1
before	1
breakfast.	1
A	1
three	1
weeks'	1
residence	1
at	1
Delaford,	1
where,	1
in	1
his	1
evening	1
hours	1
at	1
least,	1
he	1
had	1
little	1
to	1
do	1
but	1
to	1
calculate	1
the	1
disproportion	1
between	1
thirty-six	1
and	1
seventeen,	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
Barton	1
in	1
a	1
temper	1
of	1
mind	1
which	1
needed	1
all	1
the	1
improvement	1
in	1
Marianne's	1
looks,	1
all	1
the	1
kindness	1
of	1
her	1
welcome,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
encouragement	1
of	1
her	1
mother's	1
language,	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
cheerful.	1
Among	1
such	1
friends,	1
however,	1
and	1
such	1
flattery,	1
he	1
did	1
revive.	1
No	1
rumour	1
of	1
Lucy's	1
marriage	1
had	1
yet	1
reached	1
him:--he	1
knew	1
nothing	1
of	1
what	1
had	1
passed;	1
and	1
the	1
first	1
hours	1
of	1
his	1
visit	1
were	1
consequently	1
spent	1
in	1
hearing	1
and	1
in	1
wondering.	1
Every	1
thing	1
was	1
explained	1
to	1
him	1
by	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood,	1
and	1
he	1
found	1
fresh	1
reason	1
to	1
rejoice	1
in	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
for	1
Mr.	1
Ferrars,	1
since	1
eventually	1
it	1
promoted	1
the	1
interest	1
of	1
Elinor.	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
needless	1
to	1
say,	1
that	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
advanced	1
in	1
the	1
good	1
opinion	1
of	1
each	1
other,	1
as	1
they	1
advanced	1
in	1
each	1
other's	1
acquaintance,	1
for	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
otherwise.	1
Their	1
resemblance	1
in	1
good	1
principles	1
and	1
good	1
sense,	1
in	1
disposition	1
and	1
manner	1
of	1
thinking,	1
would	1
probably	1
have	1
been	1
sufficient	1
to	1
unite	1
them	1
in	1
friendship,	1
without	1
any	1
other	1
attraction;	1
but	1
their	1
being	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
two	1
sisters,	1
and	1
two	1
sisters	1
fond	1
of	1
each	1
other,	1
made	1
that	1
mutual	1
regard	1
inevitable	1
and	1
immediate,	1
which	1
might	1
otherwise	1
have	1
waited	1
the	1
effect	1
of	1
time	1
and	1
judgment.	1
The	1
letters	1
from	1
town,	1
which	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
before	1
would	1
have	1
made	1
every	1
nerve	1
in	1
Elinor's	1
body	1
thrill	1
with	1
transport,	1
now	1
arrived	1
to	1
be	1
read	1
with	1
less	1
emotion	1
that	1
mirth.	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings	1
wrote	1
to	1
tell	1
the	1
wonderful	1
tale,	1
to	1
vent	1
her	1
honest	1
indignation	1
against	1
the	1
jilting	1
girl,	1
and	1
pour	1
forth	1
her	1
compassion	1
towards	1
poor	1
Mr.	1
Edward,	1
who,	1
she	1
was	1
sure,	1
had	1
quite	1
doted	1
upon	1
the	1
worthless	1
hussy,	1
and	1
was	1
now,	1
by	1
all	1
accounts,	1
almost	1
broken-hearted,	1
at	1
Oxford.--	1
"I	1
do	1
think,"	1
she	1
continued,	1
"nothing	1
was	1
ever	1
carried	1
on	1
so	1
sly;	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
but	1
two	1
days	1
before	1
Lucy	1
called	1
and	1
sat	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
hours	1
with	1
me.	1
Not	1
a	1
soul	1
suspected	1
anything	1
of	1
the	1
matter,	1
not	1
even	1
Nancy,	1
who,	1
poor	1
soul!	1
came	1
crying	1
to	1
me	1
the	1
day	1
after,	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
fright	1
for	1
fear	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
Ferrars,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
not	1
knowing	1
how	1
to	1
get	1
to	1
Plymouth;	1
for	1
Lucy	1
it	1
seems	1
borrowed	1
all	1
her	1
money	1
before	1
she	1
went	1
off	1
to	1
be	1
married,	1
on	1
purpose	1
we	1
suppose	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
show	1
with,	1
and	1
poor	1
Nancy	1
had	1
not	1
seven	1
shillings	1
in	1
the	1
world;--so	1
I	1
was	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
give	1
her	1
five	1
guineas	1
to	1
take	1
her	1
down	1
to	1
Exeter,	1
where	1
she	1
thinks	1
of	1
staying	1
three	1
or	1
four	1
weeks	1
with	1
Mrs.	1
Burgess,	1
in	1
hopes,	1
as	1
I	1
tell	1
her,	1
to	1
fall	1
in	1
with	1
the	1
Doctor	1
again.	1
And	1
I	1
must	1
say	1
that	1
Lucy's	1
crossness	1
not	1
to	1
take	1
them	1
along	1
with	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
chaise	1
is	1
worse	1
than	1
all.	1
Poor	1
Mr.	1
Edward!	1
I	1
cannot	1
get	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
head,	1
but	1
you	1
must	1
send	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
Barton,	1
and	1
Miss	1
Marianne	1
must	1
try	1
to	1
comfort	1
him."	1
Mr.	1
Dashwood's	1
strains	1
were	1
more	1
solemn.	1
Mrs.	1
Ferrars	1
was	1
the	1
most	1
unfortunate	1
of	1
women--poor	1
Fanny	1
had	1
suffered	1
agonies	1
of	1
sensibility--and	1
he	1
considered	1
the	1
existence	1
of	1
each,	1
under	1
such	1
a	1
blow,	1
with	1
grateful	1
wonder.	1
Robert's	1
offence	1
was	1
unpardonable,	1
but	1
Lucy's	1
was	1
infinitely	1
worse.	1
Neither	1
of	1
them	1
were	1
ever	1
again	1
to	1
be	1
mentioned	1
to	1
Mrs.	1
Ferrars;	1
and	1
even,	1
if	1
she	1
might	1
hereafter	1
be	1
induced	1
to	1
forgive	1
her	1
son,	1
his	1
wife	1
should	1
never	1
be	1
acknowledged	1
as	1
her	1
daughter,	1
nor	1
be	1
permitted	1
to	1
appear	1
in	1
her	1
presence.	1
The	1
secrecy	1
with	1
which	1
everything	1
had	1
been	1
carried	1
on	1
between	1
them,	1
was	1
rationally	1
treated	1
as	1
enormously	1
heightening	1
the	1
crime,	1
because,	1
had	1
any	1
suspicion	1
of	1
it	1
occurred	1
to	1
the	1
others,	1
proper	1
measures	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
taken	1
to	1
prevent	1
the	1
marriage;	1
and	1
he	1
called	1
on	1
Elinor	1
to	1
join	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
regretting	1
that	1
Lucy's	1
engagement	1
with	1
Edward	1
had	1
not	1
rather	1
been	1
fulfilled,	1
than	1
that	1
she	1
should	1
thus	1
be	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
spreading	1
misery	1
farther	1
in	1
the	1
family.--	1
He	1
thus	1
continued:	1
"Mrs.	1
Ferrars	1
has	1
never	1
yet	1
mentioned	1
Edward's	1
name,	1
which	1
does	1
not	1
surprise	1
us;	1
but,	1
to	1
our	1
great	1
astonishment,	1
not	1
a	1
line	1
has	1
been	1
received	1
from	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
occasion.	1
Perhaps,	1
however,	1
he	1
is	1
kept	1
silent	1
by	1
his	1
fear	1
of	1
offending,	1
and	1
I	1
shall,	1
therefore,	1
give	1
him	1
a	1
hint,	1
by	1
a	1
line	1
to	1
Oxford,	1
that	1
his	1
sister	1
and	1
I	1
both	1
think	1
a	1
letter	1
of	1
proper	1
submission	1
from	1
him,	1
addressed	1
perhaps	1
to	1
Fanny,	1
and	1
by	1
her	1
shewn	1
to	1
her	1
mother,	1
might	1
not	1
be	1
taken	1
amiss;	1
for	1
we	1
all	1
know	1
the	1
tenderness	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
Ferrars's	1
heart,	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
wishes	1
for	1
nothing	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
on	1
good	1
terms	1
with	1
her	1
children."	1
This	1
paragraph	1
was	1
of	1
some	1
importance	1
to	1
the	1
prospects	1
and	1
conduct	1
of	1
Edward.	1
It	1
determined	1
him	1
to	1
attempt	1
a	1
reconciliation,	1
though	1
not	1
exactly	1
in	1
the	1
manner	1
pointed	1
out	1
by	1
their	1
brother	1
and	1
sister.	1
"A	1
letter	1
of	1
proper	1
submission!"	1
repeated	1
he;	1
"would	1
they	1
have	1
me	1
beg	1
my	1
mother's	1
pardon	1
for	1
Robert's	1
ingratitude	1
to	1
HER,	1
and	1
breach	1
of	1
honour	1
to	1
ME?--I	1
can	1
make	1
no	1
submission--I	1
am	1
grown	1
neither	1
humble	1
nor	1
penitent	1
by	1
what	1
has	1
passed.--I	1
am	1
grown	1
very	1
happy;	1
but	1
that	1
would	1
not	1
interest.--I	1
know	1
of	1
no	1
submission	1
that	1
IS	1
proper	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
make."	1
"You	1
may	1
certainly	1
ask	1
to	1
be	1
forgiven,"	1
said	1
Elinor,	1
"because	1
you	1
have	1
offended;--and	1
I	1
should	1
think	1
you	1
might	1
NOW	1
venture	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
to	1
profess	1
some	1
concern	1
for	1
having	1
ever	1
formed	1
the	1
engagement	1
which	1
drew	1
on	1
you	1
your	1
mother's	1
anger."	1
He	1
agreed	1
that	1
he	1
might.	1
"And	1
when	1
she	1
has	1
forgiven	1
you,	1
perhaps	1
a	1
little	1
humility	1
may	1
be	1
convenient	1
while	1
acknowledging	1
a	1
second	1
engagement,	1
almost	1
as	1
imprudent	1
in	1
HER	1
eyes	1
as	1
the	1
first."	1
He	1
had	1
nothing	1
to	1
urge	1
against	1
it,	1
but	1
still	1
resisted	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
a	1
letter	1
of	1
proper	1
submission;	1
and	1
therefore,	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
easier	1
to	1
him,	1
as	1
he	1
declared	1
a	1
much	1
greater	1
willingness	1
to	1
make	1
mean	1
concessions	1
by	1
word	1
of	1
mouth	1
than	1
on	1
paper,	1
it	1
was	1
resolved	1
that,	1
instead	1
of	1
writing	1
to	1
Fanny,	1
he	1
should	1
go	1
to	1
London,	1
and	1
personally	1
intreat	1
her	1
good	1
offices	1
in	1
his	1
favour.--	1
"And	1
if	1
they	1
really	1
DO	1
interest	1
themselves,"	1
said	1
Marianne,	1
in	1
her	1
new	1
character	1
of	1
candour,	1
"in	1
bringing	1
about	1
a	1
reconciliation,	1
I	1
shall	1
think	1
that	1
even	1
John	1
and	1
Fanny	1
are	1
not	1
entirely	1
without	1
merit."	1
After	1
a	1
visit	1
on	1
Colonel	1
Brandon's	1
side	1
of	1
only	1
three	1
or	1
four	1
days,	1
the	1
two	1
gentlemen	1
quitted	1
Barton	1
together.--	1
They	1
were	1
to	1
go	1
immediately	1
to	1
Delaford,	1
that	1
Edward	1
might	1
have	1
some	1
personal	1
knowledge	1
of	1
his	1
future	1
home,	1
and	1
assist	1
his	1
patron	1
and	1
friend	1
in	1
deciding	1
on	1
what	1
improvements	1
were	1
needed	1
to	1
it;	1
and	1
from	1
thence,	1
after	1
staying	1
there	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
nights,	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
proceed	1
on	1
his	1
journey	1
to	1
town.	1
CHAPTER	1
50	1
After	1
a	1
proper	1
resistance	1
on	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
Ferrars,	1
just	1
so	1
violent	1
and	1
so	1
steady	1
as	1
to	1
preserve	1
her	1
from	1
that	1
reproach	1
which	1
she	1
always	1
seemed	1
fearful	1
of	1
incurring,	1
the	1
reproach	1
of	1
being	1
too	1
amiable,	1
Edward	1
was	1
admitted	1
to	1
her	1
presence,	1
and	1
pronounced	1
to	1
be	1
again	1
her	1
son.	1
Her	1
family	1
had	1
of	1
late	1
been	1
exceedingly	1
fluctuating.	1
For	1
many	1
years	1
of	1
her	1
life	1
she	1
had	1
had	1
two	1
sons;	1
but	1
the	1
crime	1
and	1
annihilation	1
of	1
Edward	1
a	1
few	1
weeks	1
ago,	1
had	1
robbed	1
her	1
of	1
one;	1
the	1
similar	1
annihilation	1
of	1
Robert	1
had	1
left	1
her	1
for	1
a	1
fortnight	1
without	1
any;	1
and	1
now,	1
by	1
the	1
resuscitation	1
of	1
Edward,	1
she	1
had	1
one	1
again.	1
In	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
being	1
allowed	1
once	1
more	1
to	1
live,	1
however,	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
feel	1
the	1
continuance	1
of	1
his	1
existence	1
secure,	1
till	1
he	1
had	1
revealed	1
his	1
present	1
engagement;	1
for	1
the	1
publication	1
of	1
that	1
circumstance,	1
he	1
feared,	1
might	1
give	1
a	1
sudden	1
turn	1
to	1
his	1
constitution,	1
and	1
carry	1
him	1
off	1
as	1
rapidly	1
as	1
before.	1
With	1
apprehensive	1
caution	1
therefore	1
it	1
was	1
revealed,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
listened	1
to	1
with	1
unexpected	1
calmness.	1
Mrs.	1
Ferrars	1
at	1
first	1
reasonably	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
dissuade	1
him	1
from	1
marrying	1
Miss	1
Dashwood,	1
by	1
every	1
argument	1
in	1
her	1
power;--told	1
him,	1
that	1
in	1
Miss	1
Morton	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
a	1
woman	1
of	1
higher	1
rank	1
and	1
larger	1
fortune;--	1
and	1
enforced	1
the	1
assertion,	1
by	1
observing	1
that	1
Miss	1
Morton	1
was	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
a	1
nobleman	1
with	1
thirty	1
thousand	1
pounds,	1
while	1
Miss	1
Dashwood	1
was	1
only	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
a	1
private	1
gentleman	1
with	1
no	1
more	1
than	1
THREE;	1
but	1
when	1
she	1
found	1
that,	1
though	1
perfectly	1
admitting	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
her	1
representation,	1
he	1
was	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
inclined	1
to	1
be	1
guided	1
by	1
it,	1
she	1
judged	1
it	1
wisest,	1
from	1
the	1
experience	1
of	1
the	1
past,	1
to	1
submit--and	1
therefore,	1
after	1
such	1
an	1
ungracious	1
delay	1
as	1
she	1
owed	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
dignity,	1
and	1
as	1
served	1
to	1
prevent	1
every	1
suspicion	1
of	1
good-will,	1
she	1
issued	1
her	1
decree	1
of	1
consent	1
to	1
the	1
marriage	1
of	1
Edward	1
and	1
Elinor.	1
What	1
she	1
would	1
engage	1
to	1
do	1
towards	1
augmenting	1
their	1
income	1
was	1
next	1
to	1
be	1
considered;	1
and	1
here	1
it	1
plainly	1
appeared,	1
that	1
though	1
Edward	1
was	1
now	1
her	1
only	1
son,	1
he	1
was	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
her	1
eldest;	1
for	1
while	1
Robert	1
was	1
inevitably	1
endowed	1
with	1
a	1
thousand	1
pounds	1
a-year,	1
not	1
the	1
smallest	1
objection	1
was	1
made	1
against	1
Edward's	1
taking	1
orders	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
two	1
hundred	1
and	1
fifty	1
at	1
the	1
utmost;	1
nor	1
was	1
anything	1
promised	1
either	1
for	1
the	1
present	1
or	1
in	1
future,	1
beyond	1
the	1
ten	1
thousand	1
pounds,	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
given	1
with	1
Fanny.	1
It	1
was	1
as	1
much,	1
however,	1
as	1
was	1
desired,	1
and	1
more	1
than	1
was	1
expected,	1
by	1
Edward	1
and	1
Elinor;	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Ferrars	1
herself,	1
by	1
her	1
shuffling	1
excuses,	1
seemed	1
the	1
only	1
person	1
surprised	1
at	1
her	1
not	1
giving	1
more.	1
With	1
an	1
income	1
quite	1
sufficient	1
to	1
their	1
wants	1
thus	1
secured	1
to	1
them,	1
they	1
had	1
nothing	1
to	1
wait	1
for	1
after	1
Edward	1
was	1
in	1
possession	1
of	1
the	1
living,	1
but	1
the	1
readiness	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
to	1
which	1
Colonel	1
Brandon,	1
with	1
an	1
eager	1
desire	1
for	1
the	1
accommodation	1
of	1
Elinor,	1
was	1
making	1
considerable	1
improvements;	1
and	1
after	1
waiting	1
some	1
time	1
for	1
their	1
completion,	1
after	1
experiencing,	1
as	1
usual,	1
a	1
thousand	1
disappointments	1
and	1
delays	1
from	1
the	1
unaccountable	1
dilatoriness	1
of	1
the	1
workmen,	1
Elinor,	1
as	1
usual,	1
broke	1
through	1
the	1
first	1
positive	1
resolution	1
of	1
not	1
marrying	1
till	1
every	1
thing	1
was	1
ready,	1
and	1
the	1
ceremony	1
took	1
place	1
in	1
Barton	1
church	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
autumn.	1
The	1
first	1
month	1
after	1
their	1
marriage	1
was	1
spent	1
with	1
their	1
friend	1
at	1
the	1
Mansion-house;	1
from	1
whence	1
they	1
could	1
superintend	1
the	1
progress	1
of	1
the	1
Parsonage,	1
and	1
direct	1
every	1
thing	1
as	1
they	1
liked	1
on	1
the	1
spot;--	1
could	1
chuse	1
papers,	1
project	1
shrubberies,	1
and	1
invent	1
a	1
sweep.	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings's	1
prophecies,	1
though	1
rather	1
jumbled	1
together,	1
were	1
chiefly	1
fulfilled;	1
for	1
she	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
visit	1
Edward	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
in	1
their	1
Parsonage	1
by	1
Michaelmas,	1
and	1
she	1
found	1
in	1
Elinor	1
and	1
her	1
husband,	1
as	1
she	1
really	1
believed,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
happiest	1
couples	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
They	1
had	1
in	1
fact	1
nothing	1
to	1
wish	1
for,	1
but	1
the	1
marriage	1
of	1
Colonel	1
Brandon	1
and	1
Marianne,	1
and	1
rather	1
better	1
pasturage	1
for	1
their	1
cows.	1
They	1
were	1
visited	1
on	1
their	1
first	1
settling	1
by	1
almost	1
all	1
their	1
relations	1
and	1
friends.	1
Mrs.	1
Ferrars	1
came	1
to	1
inspect	1
the	1
happiness	1
which	1
she	1
was	1
almost	1
ashamed	1
of	1
having	1
authorised;	1
and	1
even	1
the	1
Dashwoods	1
were	1
at	1
the	1
expense	1
of	1
a	1
journey	1
from	1
Sussex	1
to	1
do	1
them	1
honour.	1
"I	1
will	1
not	1
say	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
disappointed,	1
my	1
dear	1
sister,"	1
said	1
John,	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
walking	1
together	1
one	1
morning	1
before	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
Delaford	1
House,	1
"THAT	1
would	1
be	1
saying	1
too	1
much,	1
for	1
certainly	1
you	1
have	1
been	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
fortunate	1
young	1
women	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
as	1
it	1
is.	1
But,	1
I	1
confess,	1
it	1
would	1
give	1
me	1
great	1
pleasure	1
to	1
call	1
Colonel	1
Brandon	1
brother.	1
His	1
property	1
here,	1
his	1
place,	1
his	1
house,	1
every	1
thing	1
is	1
in	1
such	1
respectable	1
and	1
excellent	1
condition!--and	1
his	1
woods!--I	1
have	1
not	1
seen	1
such	1
timber	1
any	1
where	1
in	1
Dorsetshire,	1
as	1
there	1
is	1
now	1
standing	1
in	1
Delaford	1
Hanger!--And	1
though,	1
perhaps,	1
Marianne	1
may	1
not	1
seem	1
exactly	1
the	1
person	1
to	1
attract	1
him--	1
yet	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
would	1
altogether	1
be	1
advisable	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
have	1
them	1
now	1
frequently	1
staying	1
with	1
you,	1
for	1
as	1
Colonel	1
Brandon	1
seems	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
at	1
home,	1
nobody	1
can	1
tell	1
what	1
may	1
happen--for,	1
when	1
people	1
are	1
much	1
thrown	1
together,	1
and	1
see	1
little	1
of	1
anybody	1
else--and	1
it	1
will	1
always	1
be	1
in	1
your	1
power	1
to	1
set	1
her	1
off	1
to	1
advantage,	1
and	1
so	1
forth;--	1
in	1
short,	1
you	1
may	1
as	1
well	1
give	1
her	1
a	1
chance--You	1
understand	1
me."--	1
But	1
though	1
Mrs.	1
Ferrars	1
DID	1
come	1
to	1
see	1
them,	1
and	1
always	1
treated	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
make-believe	1
of	1
decent	1
affection,	1
they	1
were	1
never	1
insulted	1
by	1
her	1
real	1
favour	1
and	1
preference.	1
THAT	1
was	1
due	1
to	1
the	1
folly	1
of	1
Robert,	1
and	1
the	1
cunning	1
of	1
his	1
wife;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
earned	1
by	1
them	1
before	1
many	1
months	1
had	1
passed	1
away.	1
The	1
selfish	1
sagacity	1
of	1
the	1
latter,	1
which	1
had	1
at	1
first	1
drawn	1
Robert	1
into	1
the	1
scrape,	1
was	1
the	1
principal	1
instrument	1
of	1
his	1
deliverance	1
from	1
it;	1
for	1
her	1
respectful	1
humility,	1
assiduous	1
attentions,	1
and	1
endless	1
flatteries,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
smallest	1
opening	1
was	1
given	1
for	1
their	1
exercise,	1
reconciled	1
Mrs.	1
Ferrars	1
to	1
his	1
choice,	1
and	1
re-established	1
him	1
completely	1
in	1
her	1
favour.	1
The	1
whole	1
of	1
Lucy's	1
behaviour	1
in	1
the	1
affair,	1
and	1
the	1
prosperity	1
which	1
crowned	1
it,	1
therefore,	1
may	1
be	1
held	1
forth	1
as	1
a	1
most	1
encouraging	1
instance	1
of	1
what	1
an	1
earnest,	1
an	1
unceasing	1
attention	1
to	1
self-interest,	1
however	1
its	1
progress	1
may	1
be	1
apparently	1
obstructed,	1
will	1
do	1
in	1
securing	1
every	1
advantage	1
of	1
fortune,	1
with	1
no	1
other	1
sacrifice	1
than	1
that	1
of	1
time	1
and	1
conscience.	1
When	1
Robert	1
first	1
sought	1
her	1
acquaintance,	1
and	1
privately	1
visited	1
her	1
in	1
Bartlett's	1
Buildings,	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
with	1
the	1
view	1
imputed	1
to	1
him	1
by	1
his	1
brother.	1
He	1
merely	1
meant	1
to	1
persuade	1
her	1
to	1
give	1
up	1
the	1
engagement;	1
and	1
as	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
nothing	1
to	1
overcome	1
but	1
the	1
affection	1
of	1
both,	1
he	1
naturally	1
expected	1
that	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
interviews	1
would	1
settle	1
the	1
matter.	1
In	1
that	1
point,	1
however,	1
and	1
that	1
only,	1
he	1
erred;--for	1
though	1
Lucy	1
soon	1
gave	1
him	1
hopes	1
that	1
his	1
eloquence	1
would	1
convince	1
her	1
in	1
TIME,	1
another	1
visit,	1
another	1
conversation,	1
was	1
always	1
wanted	1
to	1
produce	1
this	1
conviction.	1
Some	1
doubts	1
always	1
lingered	1
in	1
her	1
mind	1
when	1
they	1
parted,	1
which	1
could	1
only	1
be	1
removed	1
by	1
another	1
half	1
hour's	1
discourse	1
with	1
himself.	1
His	1
attendance	1
was	1
by	1
this	1
means	1
secured,	1
and	1
the	1
rest	1
followed	1
in	1
course.	1
Instead	1
of	1
talking	1
of	1
Edward,	1
they	1
came	1
gradually	1
to	1
talk	1
only	1
of	1
Robert,--a	1
subject	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
always	1
more	1
to	1
say	1
than	1
on	1
any	1
other,	1
and	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
soon	1
betrayed	1
an	1
interest	1
even	1
equal	1
to	1
his	1
own;	1
and	1
in	1
short,	1
it	1
became	1
speedily	1
evident	1
to	1
both,	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
entirely	1
supplanted	1
his	1
brother.	1
He	1
was	1
proud	1
of	1
his	1
conquest,	1
proud	1
of	1
tricking	1
Edward,	1
and	1
very	1
proud	1
of	1
marrying	1
privately	1
without	1
his	1
mother's	1
consent.	1
What	1
immediately	1
followed	1
is	1
known.	1
They	1
passed	1
some	1
months	1
in	1
great	1
happiness	1
at	1
Dawlish;	1
for	1
she	1
had	1
many	1
relations	1
and	1
old	1
acquaintances	1
to	1
cut--and	1
he	1
drew	1
several	1
plans	1
for	1
magnificent	1
cottages;--	1
and	1
from	1
thence	1
returning	1
to	1
town,	1
procured	1
the	1
forgiveness	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
Ferrars,	1
by	1
the	1
simple	1
expedient	1
of	1
asking	1
it,	1
which,	1
at	1
Lucy's	1
instigation,	1
was	1
adopted.	1
The	1
forgiveness,	1
at	1
first,	1
indeed,	1
as	1
was	1
reasonable,	1
comprehended	1
only	1
Robert;	1
and	1
Lucy,	1
who	1
had	1
owed	1
his	1
mother	1
no	1
duty	1
and	1
therefore	1
could	1
have	1
transgressed	1
none,	1
still	1
remained	1
some	1
weeks	1
longer	1
unpardoned.	1
But	1
perseverance	1
in	1
humility	1
of	1
conduct	1
and	1
messages,	1
in	1
self-condemnation	1
for	1
Robert's	1
offence,	1
and	1
gratitude	1
for	1
the	1
unkindness	1
she	1
was	1
treated	1
with,	1
procured	1
her	1
in	1
time	1
the	1
haughty	1
notice	1
which	1
overcame	1
her	1
by	1
its	1
graciousness,	1
and	1
led	1
soon	1
afterwards,	1
by	1
rapid	1
degrees,	1
to	1
the	1
highest	1
state	1
of	1
affection	1
and	1
influence.	1
Lucy	1
became	1
as	1
necessary	1
to	1
Mrs.	1
Ferrars,	1
as	1
either	1
Robert	1
or	1
Fanny;	1
and	1
while	1
Edward	1
was	1
never	1
cordially	1
forgiven	1
for	1
having	1
once	1
intended	1
to	1
marry	1
her,	1
and	1
Elinor,	1
though	1
superior	1
to	1
her	1
in	1
fortune	1
and	1
birth,	1
was	1
spoken	1
of	1
as	1
an	1
intruder,	1
SHE	1
was	1
in	1
every	1
thing	1
considered,	1
and	1
always	1
openly	1
acknowledged,	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
favourite	1
child.	1
They	1
settled	1
in	1
town,	1
received	1
very	1
liberal	1
assistance	1
from	1
Mrs.	1
Ferrars,	1
were	1
on	1
the	1
best	1
terms	1
imaginable	1
with	1
the	1
Dashwoods;	1
and	1
setting	1
aside	1
the	1
jealousies	1
and	1
ill-will	1
continually	1
subsisting	1
between	1
Fanny	1
and	1
Lucy,	1
in	1
which	1
their	1
husbands	1
of	1
course	1
took	1
a	1
part,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
frequent	1
domestic	1
disagreements	1
between	1
Robert	1
and	1
Lucy	1
themselves,	1
nothing	1
could	1
exceed	1
the	1
harmony	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
all	1
lived	1
together.	1
What	1
Edward	1
had	1
done	1
to	1
forfeit	1
the	1
right	1
of	1
eldest	1
son,	1
might	1
have	1
puzzled	1
many	1
people	1
to	1
find	1
out;	1
and	1
what	1
Robert	1
had	1
done	1
to	1
succeed	1
to	1
it,	1
might	1
have	1
puzzled	1
them	1
still	1
more.	1
It	1
was	1
an	1
arrangement,	1
however,	1
justified	1
in	1
its	1
effects,	1
if	1
not	1
in	1
its	1
cause;	1
for	1
nothing	1
ever	1
appeared	1
in	1
Robert's	1
style	1
of	1
living	1
or	1
of	1
talking	1
to	1
give	1
a	1
suspicion	1
of	1
his	1
regretting	1
the	1
extent	1
of	1
his	1
income,	1
as	1
either	1
leaving	1
his	1
brother	1
too	1
little,	1
or	1
bringing	1
himself	1
too	1
much;--and	1
if	1
Edward	1
might	1
be	1
judged	1
from	1
the	1
ready	1
discharge	1
of	1
his	1
duties	1
in	1
every	1
particular,	1
from	1
an	1
increasing	1
attachment	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
his	1
home,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
regular	1
cheerfulness	1
of	1
his	1
spirits,	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
supposed	1
no	1
less	1
contented	1
with	1
his	1
lot,	1
no	1
less	1
free	1
from	1
every	1
wish	1
of	1
an	1
exchange.	1
Elinor's	1
marriage	1
divided	1
her	1
as	1
little	1
from	1
her	1
family	1
as	1
could	1
well	1
be	1
contrived,	1
without	1
rendering	1
the	1
cottage	1
at	1
Barton	1
entirely	1
useless,	1
for	1
her	1
mother	1
and	1
sisters	1
spent	1
much	1
more	1
than	1
half	1
their	1
time	1
with	1
her.	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood	1
was	1
acting	1
on	1
motives	1
of	1
policy	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
pleasure	1
in	1
the	1
frequency	1
of	1
her	1
visits	1
at	1
Delaford;	1
for	1
her	1
wish	1
of	1
bringing	1
Marianne	1
and	1
Colonel	1
Brandon	1
together	1
was	1
hardly	1
less	1
earnest,	1
though	1
rather	1
more	1
liberal	1
than	1
what	1
John	1
had	1
expressed.	1
It	1
was	1
now	1
her	1
darling	1
object.	1
Precious	1
as	1
was	1
the	1
company	1
of	1
her	1
daughter	1
to	1
her,	1
she	1
desired	1
nothing	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
to	1
give	1
up	1
its	1
constant	1
enjoyment	1
to	1
her	1
valued	1
friend;	1
and	1
to	1
see	1
Marianne	1
settled	1
at	1
the	1
mansion-house	1
was	1
equally	1
the	1
wish	1
of	1
Edward	1
and	1
Elinor.	1
They	1
each	1
felt	1
his	1
sorrows,	1
and	1
their	1
own	1
obligations,	1
and	1
Marianne,	1
by	1
general	1
consent,	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
reward	1
of	1
all.	1
With	1
such	1
a	1
confederacy	1
against	1
her--with	1
a	1
knowledge	1
so	1
intimate	1
of	1
his	1
goodness--with	1
a	1
conviction	1
of	1
his	1
fond	1
attachment	1
to	1
herself,	1
which	1
at	1
last,	1
though	1
long	1
after	1
it	1
was	1
observable	1
to	1
everybody	1
else--burst	1
on	1
her--what	1
could	1
she	1
do?	1
Marianne	1
Dashwood	1
was	1
born	1
to	1
an	1
extraordinary	1
fate.	1
She	1
was	1
born	1
to	1
discover	1
the	1
falsehood	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
opinions,	1
and	1
to	1
counteract,	1
by	1
her	1
conduct,	1
her	1
most	1
favourite	1
maxims.	1
She	1
was	1
born	1
to	1
overcome	1
an	1
affection	1
formed	1
so	1
late	1
in	1
life	1
as	1
at	1
seventeen,	1
and	1
with	1
no	1
sentiment	1
superior	1
to	1
strong	1
esteem	1
and	1
lively	1
friendship,	1
voluntarily	1
to	1
give	1
her	1
hand	1
to	1
another!--and	1
THAT	1
other,	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
suffered	1
no	1
less	1
than	1
herself	1
under	1
the	1
event	1
of	1
a	1
former	1
attachment,	1
whom,	1
two	1
years	1
before,	1
she	1
had	1
considered	1
too	1
old	1
to	1
be	1
married,--and	1
who	1
still	1
sought	1
the	1
constitutional	1
safeguard	1
of	1
a	1
flannel	1
waistcoat!	1
But	1
so	1
it	1
was.	1
Instead	1
of	1
falling	1
a	1
sacrifice	1
to	1
an	1
irresistible	1
passion,	1
as	1
once	1
she	1
had	1
fondly	1
flattered	1
herself	1
with	1
expecting,--instead	1
of	1
remaining	1
even	1
for	1
ever	1
with	1
her	1
mother,	1
and	1
finding	1
her	1
only	1
pleasures	1
in	1
retirement	1
and	1
study,	1
as	1
afterwards	1
in	1
her	1
more	1
calm	1
and	1
sober	1
judgment	1
she	1
had	1
determined	1
on,--	1
she	1
found	1
herself	1
at	1
nineteen,	1
submitting	1
to	1
new	1
attachments,	1
entering	1
on	1
new	1
duties,	1
placed	1
in	1
a	1
new	1
home,	1
a	1
wife,	1
the	1
mistress	1
of	1
a	1
family,	1
and	1
the	1
patroness	1
of	1
a	1
village.	1
Colonel	1
Brandon	1
was	1
now	1
as	1
happy,	1
as	1
all	1
those	1
who	1
best	1
loved	1
him,	1
believed	1
he	1
deserved	1
to	1
be;--in	1
Marianne	1
he	1
was	1
consoled	1
for	1
every	1
past	1
affliction;--her	1
regard	1
and	1
her	1
society	1
restored	1
his	1
mind	1
to	1
animation,	1
and	1
his	1
spirits	1
to	1
cheerfulness;	1
and	1
that	1
Marianne	1
found	1
her	1
own	1
happiness	1
in	1
forming	1
his,	1
was	1
equally	1
the	1
persuasion	1
and	1
delight	1
of	1
each	1
observing	1
friend.	1
Marianne	1
could	1
never	1
love	1
by	1
halves;	1
and	1
her	1
whole	1
heart	1
became,	1
in	1
time,	1
as	1
much	1
devoted	1
to	1
her	1
husband,	1
as	1
it	1
had	1
once	1
been	1
to	1
Willoughby.	1
Willoughby	1
could	1
not	1
hear	1
of	1
her	1
marriage	1
without	1
a	1
pang;	1
and	1
his	1
punishment	1
was	1
soon	1
afterwards	1
complete	1
in	1
the	1
voluntary	1
forgiveness	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
Smith,	1
who,	1
by	1
stating	1
his	1
marriage	1
with	1
a	1
woman	1
of	1
character,	1
as	1
the	1
source	1
of	1
her	1
clemency,	1
gave	1
him	1
reason	1
for	1
believing	1
that	1
had	1
he	1
behaved	1
with	1
honour	1
towards	1
Marianne,	1
he	1
might	1
at	1
once	1
have	1
been	1
happy	1
and	1
rich.	1
That	1
his	1
repentance	1
of	1
misconduct,	1
which	1
thus	1
brought	1
its	1
own	1
punishment,	1
was	1
sincere,	1
need	1
not	1
be	1
doubted;--nor	1
that	1
he	1
long	1
thought	1
of	1
Colonel	1
Brandon	1
with	1
envy,	1
and	1
of	1
Marianne	1
with	1
regret.	1
But	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
for	1
ever	1
inconsolable,	1
that	1
he	1
fled	1
from	1
society,	1
or	1
contracted	1
an	1
habitual	1
gloom	1
of	1
temper,	1
or	1
died	1
of	1
a	1
broken	1
heart,	1
must	1
not	1
be	1
depended	1
on--for	1
he	1
did	1
neither.	1
He	1
lived	1
to	1
exert,	1
and	1
frequently	1
to	1
enjoy	1
himself.	1
His	1
wife	1
was	1
not	1
always	1
out	1
of	1
humour,	1
nor	1
his	1
home	1
always	1
uncomfortable;	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
breed	1
of	1
horses	1
and	1
dogs,	1
and	1
in	1
sporting	1
of	1
every	1
kind,	1
he	1
found	1
no	1
inconsiderable	1
degree	1
of	1
domestic	1
felicity.	1
For	1
Marianne,	1
however--in	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
incivility	1
in	1
surviving	1
her	1
loss--he	1
always	1
retained	1
that	1
decided	1
regard	1
which	1
interested	1
him	1
in	1
every	1
thing	1
that	1
befell	1
her,	1
and	1
made	1
her	1
his	1
secret	1
standard	1
of	1
perfection	1
in	1
woman;--	1
and	1
many	1
a	1
rising	1
beauty	1
would	1
be	1
slighted	1
by	1
him	1
in	1
after-days	1
as	1
bearing	1
no	1
comparison	1
with	1
Mrs.	1
Brandon.	1
Mrs.	1
Dashwood	1
was	1
prudent	1
enough	1
to	1
remain	1
at	1
the	1
cottage,	1
without	1
attempting	1
a	1
removal	1
to	1
Delaford;	1
and	1
fortunately	1
for	1
Sir	1
John	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Jennings,	1
when	1
Marianne	1
was	1
taken	1
from	1
them,	1
Margaret	1
had	1
reached	1
an	1
age	1
highly	1
suitable	1
for	1
dancing,	1
and	1
not	1
very	1
ineligible	1
for	1
being	1
supposed	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
lover.	1
Between	1
Barton	1
and	1
Delaford,	1
there	1
was	1
that	1
constant	1
communication	1
which	1
strong	1
family	1
affection	1
would	1
naturally	1
dictate;--and	1
among	1
the	1
merits	1
and	1
the	1
happiness	1
of	1
Elinor	1
and	1
Marianne,	1
let	1
it	1
not	1
be	1
ranked	1
as	1
the	1
least	1
considerable,	1
that	1
though	1
sisters,	1
and	1
living	1
almost	1
within	1
sight	1
of	1
each	1
other,	1
they	1
could	1
live	1
without	1
disagreement	1
between	1
themselves,	1
or	1
producing	1
coolness	1
between	1
their	1
husbands.	1
THE	1
END	1
