Book	1
I	1
Of	1
Man's	1
first	1
disobedience,	1
and	1
the	1
fruit	1
Of	1
that	1
forbidden	1
tree	1
whose	1
mortal	1
taste	1
Brought	1
death	1
into	1
the	1
World,	1
and	1
all	1
our	1
woe,	1
With	1
loss	1
of	1
Eden,	1
till	1
one	1
greater	1
Man	1
Restore	1
us,	1
and	1
regain	1
the	1
blissful	1
seat,	1
Sing,	1
Heavenly	1
Muse,	1
that,	1
on	1
the	1
secret	1
top	1
Of	1
Oreb,	1
or	1
of	1
Sinai,	1
didst	1
inspire	1
That	1
shepherd	1
who	1
first	1
taught	1
the	1
chosen	1
seed	1
In	1
the	1
beginning	1
how	1
the	1
heavens	1
and	1
earth	1
Rose	1
out	1
of	1
Chaos:	1
or,	1
if	1
Sion	1
hill	1
Delight	1
thee	1
more,	1
and	1
Siloa's	1
brook	1
that	1
flowed	1
Fast	1
by	1
the	1
oracle	1
of	1
God,	1
I	1
thence	1
Invoke	1
thy	1
aid	1
to	1
my	1
adventurous	1
song,	1
That	1
with	1
no	1
middle	1
flight	1
intends	1
to	1
soar	1
Above	1
th'	1
Aonian	1
mount,	1
while	1
it	1
pursues	1
Things	1
unattempted	1
yet	1
in	1
prose	1
or	1
rhyme.	1
And	1
chiefly	1
thou,	1
O	1
Spirit,	1
that	1
dost	1
prefer	1
Before	1
all	1
temples	1
th'	1
upright	1
heart	1
and	1
pure,	1
Instruct	1
me,	1
for	1
thou	1
know'st;	1
thou	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
Wast	1
present,	1
and,	1
with	1
mighty	1
wings	1
outspread,	1
Dove-like	1
sat'st	1
brooding	1
on	1
the	1
vast	1
Abyss,	1
And	1
mad'st	1
it	1
pregnant:	1
what	1
in	1
me	1
is	1
dark	1
Illumine,	1
what	1
is	1
low	1
raise	1
and	1
support;	1
That,	1
to	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
this	1
great	1
argument,	1
I	1
may	1
assert	1
Eternal	1
Providence,	1
And	1
justify	1
the	1
ways	1
of	1
God	1
to	1
men.	1
Say	1
first--for	1
Heaven	1
hides	1
nothing	1
from	1
thy	1
view,	1
Nor	1
the	1
deep	1
tract	1
of	1
Hell--say	1
first	1
what	1
cause	1
Moved	1
our	1
grand	1
parents,	1
in	1
that	1
happy	1
state,	1
Favoured	1
of	1
Heaven	1
so	1
highly,	1
to	1
fall	1
off	1
From	1
their	1
Creator,	1
and	1
transgress	1
his	1
will	1
For	1
one	1
restraint,	1
lords	1
of	1
the	1
World	1
besides.	1
Who	1
first	1
seduced	1
them	1
to	1
that	1
foul	1
revolt?	1
Th'	1
infernal	1
Serpent;	1
he	1
it	1
was	1
whose	1
guile,	1
Stirred	1
up	1
with	1
envy	1
and	1
revenge,	1
deceived	1
The	1
mother	1
of	1
mankind,	1
what	1
time	1
his	1
pride	1
Had	1
cast	1
him	1
out	1
from	1
Heaven,	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
host	1
Of	1
rebel	1
Angels,	1
by	1
whose	1
aid,	1
aspiring	1
To	1
set	1
himself	1
in	1
glory	1
above	1
his	1
peers,	1
He	1
trusted	1
to	1
have	1
equalled	1
the	1
Most	1
High,	1
If	1
he	1
opposed,	1
and	1
with	1
ambitious	1
aim	1
Against	1
the	1
throne	1
and	1
monarchy	1
of	1
God,	1
Raised	1
impious	1
war	1
in	1
Heaven	1
and	1
battle	1
proud,	1
With	1
vain	1
attempt.	1
Him	1
the	1
Almighty	1
Power	1
Hurled	1
headlong	1
flaming	1
from	1
th'	1
ethereal	1
sky,	1
With	1
hideous	1
ruin	1
and	1
combustion,	1
down	1
To	1
bottomless	1
perdition,	1
there	1
to	1
dwell	1
In	1
adamantine	1
chains	1
and	1
penal	1
fire,	1
Who	1
durst	1
defy	1
th'	1
Omnipotent	1
to	1
arms.	1
Nine	1
times	1
the	1
space	1
that	1
measures	1
day	1
and	1
night	1
To	1
mortal	1
men,	1
he,	1
with	1
his	1
horrid	1
crew,	1
Lay	1
vanquished,	1
rolling	1
in	1
the	1
fiery	1
gulf,	1
Confounded,	1
though	1
immortal.	1
But	1
his	1
doom	1
Reserved	1
him	1
to	1
more	1
wrath;	1
for	1
now	1
the	1
thought	1
Both	1
of	1
lost	1
happiness	1
and	1
lasting	1
pain	1
Torments	1
him:	1
round	1
he	1
throws	1
his	1
baleful	1
eyes,	1
That	1
witnessed	1
huge	1
affliction	1
and	1
dismay,	1
Mixed	1
with	1
obdurate	1
pride	1
and	1
steadfast	1
hate.	1
At	1
once,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
Angels	1
ken,	1
he	1
views	1
The	1
dismal	1
situation	1
waste	1
and	1
wild.	1
A	1
dungeon	1
horrible,	1
on	1
all	1
sides	1
round,	1
As	1
one	1
great	1
furnace	1
flamed;	1
yet	1
from	1
those	1
flames	1
No	1
light;	1
but	1
rather	1
darkness	1
visible	1
Served	1
only	1
to	1
discover	1
sights	1
of	1
woe,	1
Regions	1
of	1
sorrow,	1
doleful	1
shades,	1
where	1
peace	1
And	1
rest	1
can	1
never	1
dwell,	1
hope	1
never	1
comes	1
That	1
comes	1
to	1
all,	1
but	1
torture	1
without	1
end	1
Still	1
urges,	1
and	1
a	1
fiery	1
deluge,	1
fed	1
With	1
ever-burning	1
sulphur	1
unconsumed.	1
Such	1
place	1
Eternal	1
Justice	1
has	1
prepared	1
For	1
those	1
rebellious;	1
here	1
their	1
prison	1
ordained	1
In	1
utter	1
darkness,	1
and	1
their	1
portion	1
set,	1
As	1
far	1
removed	1
from	1
God	1
and	1
light	1
of	1
Heaven	1
As	1
from	1
the	1
centre	1
thrice	1
to	1
th'	1
utmost	1
pole.	1
Oh	1
how	1
unlike	1
the	1
place	1
from	1
whence	1
they	1
fell!	1
There	1
the	1
companions	1
of	1
his	1
fall,	1
o'erwhelmed	1
With	1
floods	1
and	1
whirlwinds	1
of	1
tempestuous	1
fire,	1
He	1
soon	1
discerns;	1
and,	1
weltering	1
by	1
his	1
side,	1
One	1
next	1
himself	1
in	1
power,	1
and	1
next	1
in	1
crime,	1
Long	1
after	1
known	1
in	1
Palestine,	1
and	1
named	1
Beelzebub.	1
To	1
whom	1
th'	1
Arch-Enemy,	1
And	1
thence	1
in	1
Heaven	1
called	1
Satan,	1
with	1
bold	1
words	1
Breaking	1
the	1
horrid	1
silence,	1
thus	1
began:--	1
"If	1
thou	1
beest	1
he--but	1
O	1
how	1
fallen!	1
how	1
changed	1
From	1
him	1
who,	1
in	1
the	1
happy	1
realms	1
of	1
light	1
Clothed	1
with	1
transcendent	1
brightness,	1
didst	1
outshine	1
Myriads,	1
though	1
bright!--if	1
he	1
whom	1
mutual	1
league,	1
United	1
thoughts	1
and	1
counsels,	1
equal	1
hope	1
And	1
hazard	1
in	1
the	1
glorious	1
enterprise	1
Joined	1
with	1
me	1
once,	1
now	1
misery	1
hath	1
joined	1
In	1
equal	1
ruin;	1
into	1
what	1
pit	1
thou	1
seest	1
From	1
what	1
height	1
fallen:	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
stronger	1
proved	1
He	1
with	1
his	1
thunder;	1
and	1
till	1
then	1
who	1
knew	1
The	1
force	1
of	1
those	1
dire	1
arms?	1
Yet	1
not	1
for	1
those,	1
Nor	1
what	1
the	1
potent	1
Victor	1
in	1
his	1
rage	1
Can	1
else	1
inflict,	1
do	1
I	1
repent,	1
or	1
change,	1
Though	1
changed	1
in	1
outward	1
lustre,	1
that	1
fixed	1
mind,	1
And	1
high	1
disdain	1
from	1
sense	1
of	1
injured	1
merit,	1
That	1
with	1
the	1
Mightiest	1
raised	1
me	1
to	1
contend,	1
And	1
to	1
the	1
fierce	1
contentions	1
brought	1
along	1
Innumerable	1
force	1
of	1
Spirits	1
armed,	1
That	1
durst	1
dislike	1
his	1
reign,	1
and,	1
me	1
preferring,	1
His	1
utmost	1
power	1
with	1
adverse	1
power	1
opposed	1
In	1
dubious	1
battle	1
on	1
the	1
plains	1
of	1
Heaven,	1
And	1
shook	1
his	1
throne.	1
What	1
though	1
the	1
field	1
be	1
lost?	1
All	1
is	1
not	1
lost--the	1
unconquerable	1
will,	1
And	1
study	1
of	1
revenge,	1
immortal	1
hate,	1
And	1
courage	1
never	1
to	1
submit	1
or	1
yield:	1
And	1
what	1
is	1
else	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
overcome?	1
That	1
glory	1
never	1
shall	1
his	1
wrath	1
or	1
might	1
Extort	1
from	1
me.	1
To	1
bow	1
and	1
sue	1
for	1
grace	1
With	1
suppliant	1
knee,	1
and	1
deify	1
his	1
power	1
Who,	1
from	1
the	1
terror	1
of	1
this	1
arm,	1
so	1
late	1
Doubted	1
his	1
empire--that	1
were	1
low	1
indeed;	1
That	1
were	1
an	1
ignominy	1
and	1
shame	1
beneath	1
This	1
downfall;	1
since,	1
by	1
fate,	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
Gods,	1
And	1
this	1
empyreal	1
sybstance,	1
cannot	1
fail;	1
Since,	1
through	1
experience	1
of	1
this	1
great	1
event,	1
In	1
arms	1
not	1
worse,	1
in	1
foresight	1
much	1
advanced,	1
We	1
may	1
with	1
more	1
successful	1
hope	1
resolve	1
To	1
wage	1
by	1
force	1
or	1
guile	1
eternal	1
war,	1
Irreconcilable	1
to	1
our	1
grand	1
Foe,	1
Who	1
now	1
triumphs,	1
and	1
in	1
th'	1
excess	1
of	1
joy	1
Sole	1
reigning	1
holds	1
the	1
tyranny	1
of	1
Heaven."	1
So	1
spake	1
th'	1
apostate	1
Angel,	1
though	1
in	1
pain,	1
Vaunting	1
aloud,	1
but	1
racked	1
with	1
deep	1
despair;	1
And	1
him	1
thus	1
answered	1
soon	1
his	1
bold	1
compeer:--	1
"O	1
Prince,	1
O	1
Chief	1
of	1
many	1
throned	1
Powers	1
That	1
led	1
th'	1
embattled	1
Seraphim	1
to	1
war	1
Under	1
thy	1
conduct,	1
and,	1
in	1
dreadful	1
deeds	1
Fearless,	1
endangered	1
Heaven's	1
perpetual	1
King,	1
And	1
put	1
to	1
proof	1
his	1
high	1
supremacy,	1
Whether	1
upheld	1
by	1
strength,	1
or	1
chance,	1
or	1
fate,	1
Too	1
well	1
I	1
see	1
and	1
rue	1
the	1
dire	1
event	1
That,	1
with	1
sad	1
overthrow	1
and	1
foul	1
defeat,	1
Hath	1
lost	1
us	1
Heaven,	1
and	1
all	1
this	1
mighty	1
host	1
In	1
horrible	1
destruction	1
laid	1
thus	1
low,	1
As	1
far	1
as	1
Gods	1
and	1
heavenly	1
Essences	1
Can	1
perish:	1
for	1
the	1
mind	1
and	1
spirit	1
remains	1
Invincible,	1
and	1
vigour	1
soon	1
returns,	1
Though	1
all	1
our	1
glory	1
extinct,	1
and	1
happy	1
state	1
Here	1
swallowed	1
up	1
in	1
endless	1
misery.	1
But	1
what	1
if	1
he	1
our	1
Conqueror	1
(whom	1
I	1
now	1
Of	1
force	1
believe	1
almighty,	1
since	1
no	1
less	1
Than	1
such	1
could	1
have	1
o'erpowered	1
such	1
force	1
as	1
ours)	1
Have	1
left	1
us	1
this	1
our	1
spirit	1
and	1
strength	1
entire,	1
Strongly	1
to	1
suffer	1
and	1
support	1
our	1
pains,	1
That	1
we	1
may	1
so	1
suffice	1
his	1
vengeful	1
ire,	1
Or	1
do	1
him	1
mightier	1
service	1
as	1
his	1
thralls	1
By	1
right	1
of	1
war,	1
whate'er	1
his	1
business	1
be,	1
Here	1
in	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
Hell	1
to	1
work	1
in	1
fire,	1
Or	1
do	1
his	1
errands	1
in	1
the	1
gloomy	1
Deep?	1
What	1
can	1
it	1
the	1
avail	1
though	1
yet	1
we	1
feel	1
Strength	1
undiminished,	1
or	1
eternal	1
being	1
To	1
undergo	1
eternal	1
punishment?"	1
Whereto	1
with	1
speedy	1
words	1
th'	1
Arch-Fiend	1
replied:--	1
"Fallen	1
Cherub,	1
to	1
be	1
weak	1
is	1
miserable,	1
Doing	1
or	1
suffering:	1
but	1
of	1
this	1
be	1
sure--	1
To	1
do	1
aught	1
good	1
never	1
will	1
be	1
our	1
task,	1
But	1
ever	1
to	1
do	1
ill	1
our	1
sole	1
delight,	1
As	1
being	1
the	1
contrary	1
to	1
his	1
high	1
will	1
Whom	1
we	1
resist.	1
If	1
then	1
his	1
providence	1
Out	1
of	1
our	1
evil	1
seek	1
to	1
bring	1
forth	1
good,	1
Our	1
labour	1
must	1
be	1
to	1
pervert	1
that	1
end,	1
And	1
out	1
of	1
good	1
still	1
to	1
find	1
means	1
of	1
evil;	1
Which	1
ofttimes	1
may	1
succeed	1
so	1
as	1
perhaps	1
Shall	1
grieve	1
him,	1
if	1
I	1
fail	1
not,	1
and	1
disturb	1
His	1
inmost	1
counsels	1
from	1
their	1
destined	1
aim.	1
But	1
see!	1
the	1
angry	1
Victor	1
hath	1
recalled	1
His	1
ministers	1
of	1
vengeance	1
and	1
pursuit	1
Back	1
to	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
Heaven:	1
the	1
sulphurous	1
hail,	1
Shot	1
after	1
us	1
in	1
storm,	1
o'erblown	1
hath	1
laid	1
The	1
fiery	1
surge	1
that	1
from	1
the	1
precipice	1
Of	1
Heaven	1
received	1
us	1
falling;	1
and	1
the	1
thunder,	1
Winged	1
with	1
red	1
lightning	1
and	1
impetuous	1
rage,	1
Perhaps	1
hath	1
spent	1
his	1
shafts,	1
and	1
ceases	1
now	1
To	1
bellow	1
through	1
the	1
vast	1
and	1
boundless	1
Deep.	1
Let	1
us	1
not	1
slip	1
th'	1
occasion,	1
whether	1
scorn	1
Or	1
satiate	1
fury	1
yield	1
it	1
from	1
our	1
Foe.	1
Seest	1
thou	1
yon	1
dreary	1
plain,	1
forlorn	1
and	1
wild,	1
The	1
seat	1
of	1
desolation,	1
void	1
of	1
light,	1
Save	1
what	1
the	1
glimmering	1
of	1
these	1
livid	1
flames	1
Casts	1
pale	1
and	1
dreadful?	1
Thither	1
let	1
us	1
tend	1
From	1
off	1
the	1
tossing	1
of	1
these	1
fiery	1
waves;	1
There	1
rest,	1
if	1
any	1
rest	1
can	1
harbour	1
there;	1
And,	1
re-assembling	1
our	1
afflicted	1
powers,	1
Consult	1
how	1
we	1
may	1
henceforth	1
most	1
offend	1
Our	1
enemy,	1
our	1
own	1
loss	1
how	1
repair,	1
How	1
overcome	1
this	1
dire	1
calamity,	1
What	1
reinforcement	1
we	1
may	1
gain	1
from	1
hope,	1
If	1
not,	1
what	1
resolution	1
from	1
despair."	1
Thus	1
Satan,	1
talking	1
to	1
his	1
nearest	1
mate,	1
With	1
head	1
uplift	1
above	1
the	1
wave,	1
and	1
eyes	1
That	1
sparkling	1
blazed;	1
his	1
other	1
parts	1
besides	1
Prone	1
on	1
the	1
flood,	1
extended	1
long	1
and	1
large,	1
Lay	1
floating	1
many	1
a	1
rood,	1
in	1
bulk	1
as	1
huge	1
As	1
whom	1
the	1
fables	1
name	1
of	1
monstrous	1
size,	1
Titanian	1
or	1
Earth-born,	1
that	1
warred	1
on	1
Jove,	1
Briareos	1
or	1
Typhon,	1
whom	1
the	1
den	1
By	1
ancient	1
Tarsus	1
held,	1
or	1
that	1
sea-beast	1
Leviathan,	1
which	1
God	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
works	1
Created	1
hugest	1
that	1
swim	1
th'	1
ocean-stream.	1
Him,	1
haply	1
slumbering	1
on	1
the	1
Norway	1
foam,	1
The	1
pilot	1
of	1
some	1
small	1
night-foundered	1
skiff,	1
Deeming	1
some	1
island,	1
oft,	1
as	1
seamen	1
tell,	1
With	1
fixed	1
anchor	1
in	1
his	1
scaly	1

Moors	1
by	1
his	1
side	1
under	1
the	1
lee,	1
while	1
night	1
Invests	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
wished	1
morn	1
delays.	1
So	1
stretched	1
out	1
huge	1
in	1
length	1
the	1
Arch-fiend	1
lay,	1
Chained	1
on	1
the	1
burning	1
lake;	1
nor	1
ever	1
thence	1
Had	1
risen,	1
or	1
heaved	1
his	1
head,	1
but	1
that	1
the	1
will	1
And	1
high	1
permission	1
of	1
all-ruling	1
Heaven	1
Left	1
him	1
at	1
large	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
dark	1
designs,	1
That	1
with	1
reiterated	1
crimes	1
he	1
might	1
Heap	1
on	1
himself	1
damnation,	1
while	1
he	1
sought	1
Evil	1
to	1
others,	1
and	1
enraged	1
might	1
see	1
How	1
all	1
his	1
malice	1
served	1
but	1
to	1
bring	1
forth	1
Infinite	1
goodness,	1
grace,	1
and	1
mercy,	1
shewn	1
On	1
Man	1
by	1
him	1
seduced,	1
but	1
on	1
himself	1
Treble	1
confusion,	1
wrath,	1
and	1
vengeance	1
poured.	1
Forthwith	1
upright	1
he	1
rears	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
pool	1
His	1
mighty	1
stature;	1
on	1
each	1
hand	1
the	1
flames	1
Driven	1
backward	1
slope	1
their	1
pointing	1
spires,	1
and,rolled	1
In	1
billows,	1
leave	1
i'	1
th'	1
midst	1
a	1
horrid	1
vale.	1
Then	1
with	1
expanded	1
wings	1
he	1
steers	1
his	1
flight	1
Aloft,	1
incumbent	1
on	1
the	1
dusky	1
air,	1
That	1
felt	1
unusual	1
weight;	1
till	1
on	1
dry	1
land	1
He	1
lights--if	1
it	1
were	1
land	1
that	1
ever	1
burned	1
With	1
solid,	1
as	1
the	1
lake	1
with	1
liquid	1
fire,	1
And	1
such	1
appeared	1
in	1
hue	1
as	1
when	1
the	1
force	1
Of	1
subterranean	1
wind	1
transprots	1
a	1
hill	1
Torn	1
from	1
Pelorus,	1
or	1
the	1
shattered	1
side	1
Of	1
thundering	1
Etna,	1
whose	1
combustible	1
And	1
fuelled	1
entrails,	1
thence	1
conceiving	1
fire,	1
Sublimed	1
with	1
mineral	1
fury,	1
aid	1
the	1
winds,	1
And	1
leave	1
a	1
singed	1
bottom	1
all	1
involved	1
With	1
stench	1
and	1
smoke.	1
Such	1
resting	1
found	1
the	1
sole	1
Of	1
unblest	1
feet.	1
Him	1
followed	1
his	1
next	1
mate;	1
Both	1
glorying	1
to	1
have	1
scaped	1
the	1
Stygian	1
flood	1
As	1
gods,	1
and	1
by	1
their	1
own	1
recovered	1
strength,	1
Not	1
by	1
the	1
sufferance	1
of	1
supernal	1
Power.	1
"Is	1
this	1
the	1
region,	1
this	1
the	1
soil,	1
the	1
clime,"	1
Said	1
then	1
the	1
lost	1
Archangel,	1
"this	1
the	1
seat	1
That	1
we	1
must	1
change	1
for	1
Heaven?--this	1
mournful	1
gloom	1
For	1
that	1
celestial	1
light?	1
Be	1
it	1
so,	1
since	1
he	1
Who	1
now	1
is	1
sovereign	1
can	1
dispose	1
and	1
bid	1
What	1
shall	1
be	1
right:	1
farthest	1
from	1
him	1
is	1
best	1
Whom	1
reason	1
hath	1
equalled,	1
force	1
hath	1
made	1
supreme	1
Above	1
his	1
equals.	1
Farewell,	1
happy	1
fields,	1
Where	1
joy	1
for	1
ever	1
dwells!	1
Hail,	1
horrors!	1
hail,	1
Infernal	1
world!	1
and	1
thou,	1
profoundest	1
Hell,	1
Receive	1
thy	1
new	1
possessor--one	1
who	1
brings	1
A	1
mind	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
changed	1
by	1
place	1
or	1
time.	1
The	1
mind	1
is	1
its	1
own	1
place,	1
and	1
in	1
itself	1
Can	1
make	1
a	1
Heaven	1
of	1
Hell,	1
a	1
Hell	1
of	1
Heaven.	1
What	1
matter	1
where,	1
if	1
I	1
be	1
still	1
the	1
same,	1
And	1
what	1
I	1
should	1
be,	1
all	1
but	1
less	1
than	1
he	1
Whom	1
thunder	1
hath	1
made	1
greater?	1
Here	1
at	1
least	1
We	1
shall	1
be	1
free;	1
th'	1
Almighty	1
hath	1
not	1
built	1
Here	1
for	1
his	1
envy,	1
will	1
not	1
drive	1
us	1
hence:	1
Here	1
we	1
may	1
reigh	1
secure;	1
and,	1
in	1
my	1
choice,	1
To	1
reign	1
is	1
worth	1
ambition,	1
though	1
in	1
Hell:	1
Better	1
to	1
reign	1
in	1
Hell	1
than	1
serve	1
in	1
Heaven.	1
But	1
wherefore	1
let	1
we	1
then	1
our	1
faithful	1
friends,	1
Th'	1
associates	1
and	1
co-partners	1
of	1
our	1
loss,	1
Lie	1
thus	1
astonished	1
on	1
th'	1
oblivious	1
pool,	1
And	1
call	1
them	1
not	1
to	1
share	1
with	1
us	1
their	1
part	1
In	1
this	1
unhappy	1
mansion,	1
or	1
once	1
more	1
With	1
rallied	1
arms	1
to	1
try	1
what	1
may	1
be	1
yet	1
Regained	1
in	1
Heaven,	1
or	1
what	1
more	1
lost	1
in	1
Hell?"	1
So	1
Satan	1
spake;	1
and	1
him	1
Beelzebub	1
Thus	1
answered:--"Leader	1
of	1
those	1
armies	1
bright	1
Which,	1
but	1
th'	1
Omnipotent,	1
none	1
could	1
have	1
foiled!	1
If	1
once	1
they	1
hear	1
that	1
voice,	1
their	1
liveliest	1
pledge	1
Of	1
hope	1
in	1
fears	1
and	1
dangers--heard	1
so	1
oft	1
In	1
worst	1
extremes,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
perilous	1
edge	1
Of	1
battle,	1
when	1
it	1
raged,	1
in	1
all	1
assaults	1
Their	1
surest	1
signal--they	1
will	1
soon	1
resume	1
New	1
courage	1
and	1
revive,	1
though	1
now	1
they	1
lie	1
Grovelling	1
and	1
prostrate	1
on	1
yon	1
lake	1
of	1
fire,	1
As	1
we	1
erewhile,	1
astounded	1
and	1
amazed;	1
No	1
wonder,	1
fallen	1
such	1
a	1
pernicious	1
height!"	1
He	1
scare	1
had	1
ceased	1
when	1
the	1
superior	1
Fiend	1
Was	1
moving	1
toward	1
the	1
shore;	1
his	1
ponderous	1
shield,	1
Ethereal	1
temper,	1
massy,	1
large,	1
and	1
round,	1
Behind	1
him	1
cast.	1
The	1
broad	1
circumference	1
Hung	1
on	1
his	1
shoulders	1
like	1
the	1
moon,	1
whose	1
orb	1
Through	1
optic	1
glass	1
the	1
Tuscan	1
artist	1
views	1
At	1
evening,	1
from	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
Fesole,	1
Or	1
in	1
Valdarno,	1
to	1
descry	1
new	1
lands,	1
Rivers,	1
or	1
mountains,	1
in	1
her	1
spotty	1
globe.	1
His	1
spear--to	1
equal	1
which	1
the	1
tallest	1
pine	1
Hewn	1
on	1
Norwegian	1
hills,	1
to	1
be	1
the	1

Of	1
some	1
great	1
ammiral,	1

but	1
a	1
wand--	1
He	1
walked	1
with,	1
to	1
support	1
uneasy	1
steps	1
Over	1
the	1
burning	1
marl,	1
not	1
like	1
those	1
steps	1
On	1
Heaven's	1
azure;	1
and	1
the	1
torrid	1
clime	1
Smote	1
on	1
him	1
sore	1
besides,	1
vaulted	1
with	1
fire.	1
Nathless	1
he	1
so	1
endured,	1
till	1
on	1
the	1
beach	1
Of	1
that	1
inflamed	1
sea	1
he	1
stood,	1
and	1
called	1
His	1
legions--Angel	1
Forms,	1
who	1
lay	1
entranced	1
Thick	1
as	1
autumnal	1
leaves	1
that	1
strow	1
the	1
brooks	1
In	1
Vallombrosa,	1
where	1
th'	1
Etrurian	1
shades	1
High	1
over-arched	1
embower;	1
or	1
scattered	1
sedge	1
Afloat,	1
when	1
with	1
fierce	1
winds	1
Orion	1
armed	1
Hath	1
vexed	1
the	1
Red-Sea	1
coast,	1
whose	1
waves	1
o'erthrew	1
Busiris	1
and	1
his	1
Memphian	1
chivalry,	1
While	1
with	1
perfidious	1
hatred	1
they	1
pursued	1
The	1
sojourners	1
of	1
Goshen,	1
who	1
beheld	1
From	1
the	1
safe	1
shore	1
their	1
floating	1
carcases	1
And	1
broken	1
chariot-wheels.	1
So	1
thick	1
bestrown,	1
Abject	1
and	1
lost,	1
lay	1
these,	1
covering	1
the	1
flood,	1
Under	1
amazement	1
of	1
their	1
hideous	1
change.	1
He	1
called	1
so	1
loud	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
hollow	1
deep	1
Of	1
Hell	1
resounded:--"Princes,	1
Potentates,	1
Warriors,	1
the	1
Flower	1
of	1
Heaven--once	1
yours;	1
now	1
lost,	1
If	1
such	1
astonishment	1
as	1
this	1
can	1
seize	1
Eternal	1
Spirits!	1
Or	1
have	1
ye	1
chosen	1
this	1
place	1
After	1
the	1
toil	1
of	1
battle	1
to	1
repose	1
Your	1
wearied	1
virtue,	1
for	1
the	1
ease	1
you	1
find	1
To	1
slumber	1
here,	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
vales	1
of	1
Heaven?	1
Or	1
in	1
this	1
abject	1
posture	1
have	1
ye	1
sworn	1
To	1
adore	1
the	1
Conqueror,	1
who	1
now	1
beholds	1
Cherub	1
and	1
Seraph	1
rolling	1
in	1
the	1
flood	1
With	1
scattered	1
arms	1
and	1
ensigns,	1
till	1
anon	1
His	1
swift	1
pursuers	1
from	1
Heaven-gates	1
discern	1
Th'	1
advantage,	1
and,	1
descending,	1
tread	1
us	1
down	1
Thus	1
drooping,	1
or	1
with	1
linked	1
thunderbolts	1
Transfix	1
us	1
to	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
this	1
gulf?	1
Awake,	1
arise,	1
or	1
be	1
for	1
ever	1
fallen!"	1
They	1
heard,	1
and	1
were	1
abashed,	1
and	1
up	1
they	1
sprung	1
Upon	1
the	1
wing,	1
as	1
when	1
men	1
wont	1
to	1
watch	1
On	1
duty,	1
sleeping	1
found	1
by	1
whom	1
they	1
dread,	1
Rouse	1
and	1
bestir	1
themselves	1
ere	1
well	1
awake.	1
Nor	1
did	1
they	1
not	1
perceive	1
the	1
evil	1
plight	1
In	1
which	1
they	1
were,	1
or	1
the	1
fierce	1
pains	1
not	1
feel;	1
Yet	1
to	1
their	1
General's	1
voice	1
they	1
soon	1
obeyed	1
Innumerable.	1
As	1
when	1
the	1
potent	1
rod	1
Of	1
Amram's	1
son,	1
in	1
Egypt's	1
evil	1
day,	1
Waved	1
round	1
the	1
coast,	1
up-called	1
a	1
pitchy	1
cloud	1
Of	1
locusts,	1
warping	1
on	1
the	1
eastern	1
wind,	1
That	1
o'er	1
the	1
realm	1
of	1
impious	1
Pharaoh	1
hung	1
Like	1
Night,	1
and	1
darkened	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Nile;	1
So	1
numberless	1
were	1
those	1
bad	1
Angels	1
seen	1
Hovering	1
on	1
wing	1
under	1
the	1
cope	1
of	1
Hell,	1
'Twixt	1
upper,	1
nether,	1
and	1
surrounding	1
fires;	1
Till,	1
as	1
a	1
signal	1
given,	1
th'	1
uplifted	1
spear	1
Of	1
their	1
great	1
Sultan	1
waving	1
to	1
direct	1
Their	1
course,	1
in	1
even	1
balance	1
down	1
they	1
light	1
On	1
the	1
firm	1
brimstone,	1
and	1
fill	1
all	1
the	1
plain:	1
A	1
multitude	1
like	1
which	1
the	1
populous	1
North	1
Poured	1
never	1
from	1
her	1
frozen	1
loins	1
to	1
pass	1
Rhene	1
or	1
the	1
Danaw,	1
when	1
her	1
barbarous	1
sons	1
Came	1
like	1
a	1
deluge	1
on	1
the	1
South,	1
and	1
spread	1
Beneath	1
Gibraltar	1
to	1
the	1
Libyan	1

Forthwith,	1
form	1
every	1
squadron	1
and	1
each	1

The	1
heads	1
and	1
leaders	1
thither	1
haste	1
where	1
stood	1
Their	1
great	1
Commander--godlike	1
Shapes,	1
and	1
Forms	1
Excelling	1
human;	1
princely	1
Dignities;	1
And	1
Powers	1
that	1
erst	1
in	1
Heaven	1
sat	1
on	1
thrones,	1
Though	1
on	1
their	1

in	1
Heavenly	1

now	1
Be	1
no	1

blotted	1
out	1
and	1
rased	1
By	1
their	1
rebellion	1
from	1
the	1

of	1
Life.	1
Nor	1

Got	1

wandering	1
o'er	1
the	1
earth,	1
Through	1
God's	1
high	1
sufferance	1
for	1
the	1
trial	1
of	1
man,	1
By	1
falsities	1
and	1
lies	1
the	1
greatest	1
part	1
Of	1
mankind	1
they	1
corrupted	1
to	1
forsake	1
God	1
their	1
Creator,	1
and	1
th'	1
invisible	1
Glory	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
made	1
them	1
to	1
transform	1
Oft	1
to	1
the	1
image	1
of	1
a	1
brute,	1
adorned	1
With	1
gay	1
religions	1
full	1
of	1
pomp	1
and	1
gold,	1
And	1
devils	1
to	1
adore	1
for	1
deities:	1
Then	1
were	1
they	1
known	1
to	1
men	1
by	1
various	1
names,	1
And	1
various	1
idols	1
through	1
the	1
heathen	1
world.	1
Say,	1
Muse,	1
their	1
names	1
then	1
known,	1
who	1
first,	1
who	1
last,	1
Roused	1
from	1
the	1
slumber	1
on	1
that	1
fiery	1
couch,	1
At	1
their	1
great	1
Emperor's	1
call,	1
as	1
next	1
in	1
worth	1
Came	1
singly	1
where	1
he	1
stood	1
on	1
the	1
bare	1
strand,	1
While	1
the	1
promiscuous	1
crowd	1
stood	1
yet	1
aloof?	1
The	1
chief	1
were	1
those	1
who,	1
from	1
the	1
pit	1
of	1
Hell	1
Roaming	1
to	1
seek	1
their	1
prey	1
on	1
Earth,	1
durst	1
fix	1
Their	1
seats,	1
long	1
after,	1
next	1
the	1
seat	1
of	1
God,	1
Their	1
altars	1
by	1
his	1
altar,	1
gods	1
adored	1
Among	1
the	1
nations	1
round,	1
and	1
durst	1
abide	1
Jehovah	1
thundering	1
out	1
of	1
Sion,	1
throned	1
Between	1
the	1
Cherubim;	1
yea,	1
often	1
placed	1
Within	1
his	1
sanctuary	1
itself	1
their	1
shrines,	1
Abominations;	1
and	1
with	1
cursed	1
things	1
His	1
holy	1
rites	1
and	1
solemn	1
feasts	1
profaned,	1
And	1
with	1
their	1
darkness	1
durst	1
affront	1
his	1
light.	1
First,	1
Moloch,	1
horrid	1
king,	1
besmeared	1
with	1
blood	1
Of	1
human	1
sacrifice,	1
and	1
parents'	1
tears;	1
Though,	1
for	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
drums	1
and	1
timbrels	1
loud,	1
Their	1
children's	1
cries	1
unheard	1
that	1
passed	1
through	1
fire	1
To	1
his	1
grim	1
idol.	1
Him	1
the	1
Ammonite	1
Worshiped	1
in	1
Rabba	1
and	1
her	1
watery	1
plain,	1
In	1
Argob	1
and	1
in	1
Basan,	1
to	1
the	1
stream	1
Of	1
utmost	1
Arnon.	1
Nor	1
content	1
with	1
such	1
Audacious	1
neighbourhood,	1
the	1
wisest	1
heart	1
Of	1
Solomon	1
he	1
led	1
by	1
fraoud	1
to	1
build	1
His	1
temple	1
right	1
against	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
God	1
On	1
that	1
opprobrious	1
hill,	1
and	1
made	1
his	1
grove	1
The	1
pleasant	1
valley	1
of	1
Hinnom,	1
Tophet	1
thence	1
And	1
black	1
Gehenna	1
called,	1
the	1
type	1
of	1
Hell.	1
Next	1
Chemos,	1
th'	1
obscene	1
dread	1
of	1
Moab's	1
sons,	1
From	1
Aroar	1
to	1
Nebo	1
and	1
the	1
wild	1
Of	1
southmost	1
Abarim;	1
in	1
Hesebon	1
And	1
Horonaim,	1
Seon's	1
real,	1
beyond	1
The	1
flowery	1
dale	1
of	1
Sibma	1
clad	1
with	1
vines,	1
And	1
Eleale	1
to	1
th'	1
Asphaltic	1
Pool:	1
Peor	1
his	1
other	1
name,	1
when	1
he	1
enticed	1
Israel	1
in	1
Sittim,	1
on	1
their	1
march	1
from	1
Nile,	1
To	1
do	1
him	1
wanton	1
rites,	1
which	1
cost	1
them	1
woe.	1
Yet	1
thence	1
his	1
lustful	1
orgies	1
he	1
enlarged	1
Even	1
to	1
that	1
hill	1
of	1
scandal,	1
by	1
the	1
grove	1
Of	1
Moloch	1
homicide,	1
lust	1
hard	1
by	1
hate,	1
Till	1
good	1
Josiah	1
drove	1
them	1
thence	1
to	1
Hell.	1
With	1
these	1
came	1
they	1
who,	1
from	1
the	1
bordering	1
flood	1
Of	1
old	1
Euphrates	1
to	1
the	1
brook	1
that	1
parts	1
Egypt	1
from	1
Syrian	1
ground,	1
had	1
general	1
names	1
Of	1
Baalim	1
and	1
Ashtaroth--those	1
male,	1
These	1
feminine.	1
For	1
Spirits,	1
when	1
they	1
please,	1
Can	1
either	1
sex	1
assume,	1
or	1
both;	1
so	1
soft	1
And	1
uncompounded	1
is	1
their	1
essence	1
pure,	1
Not	1
tried	1
or	1
manacled	1
with	1
joint	1
or	1
limb,	1
Nor	1
founded	1
on	1
the	1
brittle	1
strength	1
of	1
bones,	1
Like	1
cumbrous	1
flesh;	1
but,	1
in	1
what	1
shape	1
they	1
choose,	1
Dilated	1
or	1
condensed,	1
bright	1
or	1
obscure,	1
Can	1
execute	1
their	1
airy	1
purposes,	1
And	1
works	1
of	1
love	1
or	1
enmity	1
fulfil.	1
For	1
those	1
the	1
race	1
of	1
Israel	1
oft	1
forsook	1
Their	1
Living	1
Strength,	1
and	1
unfrequented	1
left	1
His	1
righteous	1
altar,	1
bowing	1
lowly	1
down	1
To	1
bestial	1
gods;	1
for	1
which	1
their	1
heads	1
as	1
low	1
Bowed	1
down	1
in	1
battle,	1
sunk	1
before	1
the	1
spear	1
Of	1
despicable	1
foes.	1
With	1
these	1
in	1
troop	1
Came	1
Astoreth,	1
whom	1
the	1
Phoenicians	1
called	1
Astarte,	1
queen	1
of	1
heaven,	1
with	1
crescent	1
horns;	1
To	1
whose	1
bright	1
image	1
nigntly	1
by	1
the	1
moon	1
Sidonian	1
virgins	1
paid	1
their	1
vows	1
and	1
songs;	1
In	1
Sion	1
also	1
not	1
unsung,	1
where	1
stood	1
Her	1
temple	1
on	1
th'	1
offensive	1
mountain,	1
built	1
By	1
that	1
uxorious	1
king	1
whose	1
heart,	1
though	1
large,	1
Beguiled	1
by	1
fair	1
idolatresses,	1
fell	1
To	1
idols	1
foul.	1
Thammuz	1
came	1
next	1
behind,	1
Whose	1
annual	1
wound	1
in	1
Lebanon	1
allured	1
The	1
Syrian	1
damsels	1
to	1
lament	1
his	1
fate	1
In	1
amorous	1
ditties	1
all	1
a	1
summer's	1
day,	1
While	1
smooth	1
Adonis	1
from	1
his	1
native	1
rock	1
Ran	1
purple	1
to	1
the	1
sea,	1
supposed	1
with	1
blood	1
Of	1
Thammuz	1
yearly	1
wounded:	1
the	1
love-tale	1
Infected	1
Sion's	1
daughters	1
with	1
like	1
heat,	1
Whose	1
wanton	1
passions	1
in	1
the	1
sacred	1
proch	1
Ezekiel	1
saw,	1
when,	1
by	1
the	1
vision	1
led,	1
His	1
eye	1
surveyed	1
the	1
dark	1
idolatries	1
Of	1
alienated	1
Judah.	1
Next	1
came	1
one	1
Who	1
mourned	1
in	1
earnest,	1
when	1
the	1
captive	1
ark	1
Maimed	1
his	1
brute	1
image,	1
head	1
and	1
hands	1
lopt	1
off,	1
In	1
his	1
own	1
temple,	1
on	1
the	1
grunsel-edge,	1
Where	1
he	1
fell	1
flat	1
and	1
shamed	1
his	1
worshippers:	1
Dagon	1
his	1
name,	1
sea-monster,upward	1
man	1
And	1
downward	1
fish;	1
yet	1
had	1
his	1
temple	1
high	1
Reared	1
in	1
Azotus,	1
dreaded	1
through	1
the	1
coast	1
Of	1
Palestine,	1
in	1
Gath	1
and	1
Ascalon,	1
And	1
Accaron	1
and	1
Gaza's	1
frontier	1
bounds.	1
Him	1
followed	1
Rimmon,	1
whose	1
delightful	1
seat	1
Was	1
fair	1
Damascus,	1
on	1
the	1
fertile	1
banks	1
Of	1
Abbana	1
and	1
Pharphar,	1
lucid	1
streams.	1
He	1
also	1
against	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God	1
was	1
bold:	1
A	1
leper	1
once	1
he	1
lost,	1
and	1
gained	1
a	1
king--	1
Ahaz,	1
his	1
sottish	1
conqueror,	1
whom	1
he	1
drew	1
God's	1
altar	1
to	1
disparage	1
and	1
displace	1
For	1
one	1
of	1
Syrian	1
mode,	1
whereon	1
to	1
burn	1
His	1
odious	1
offerings,	1
and	1
adore	1
the	1
gods	1
Whom	1
he	1
had	1
vanquished.	1
After	1
these	1
appeared	1
A	1
crew	1
who,	1
under	1
names	1
of	1
old	1
renown--	1
Osiris,	1
Isis,	1
Orus,	1
and	1
their	1
train--	1
With	1
monstrous	1
shapes	1
and	1
sorceries	1
abused	1
Fanatic	1
Egypt	1
and	1
her	1
priests	1
to	1
seek	1
Their	1
wandering	1
gods	1
disguised	1
in	1
brutish	1
forms	1
Rather	1
than	1
human.	1
Nor	1
did	1
Israel	1
scape	1
Th'	1
infection,	1
when	1
their	1
borrowed	1
gold	1
composed	1
The	1
calf	1
in	1
Oreb;	1
and	1
the	1
rebel	1
king	1
Doubled	1
that	1
sin	1
in	1
Bethel	1
and	1
in	1
Dan,	1
Likening	1
his	1
Maker	1
to	1
the	1
grazed	1
ox--	1
Jehovah,	1
who,	1
in	1
one	1
night,	1
when	1
he	1
passed	1
From	1
Egypt	1
marching,	1
equalled	1
with	1
one	1
stroke	1
Both	1
her	1
first-born	1
and	1
all	1
her	1
bleating	1
gods.	1
Belial	1
came	1
last;	1
than	1
whom	1
a	1
Spirit	1
more	1
lewd	1
Fell	1
not	1
from	1
Heaven,	1
or	1
more	1
gross	1
to	1
love	1
Vice	1
for	1
itself.	1
To	1
him	1
no	1
temple	1
stood	1
Or	1
altar	1
smoked;	1
yet	1
who	1
more	1
oft	1
than	1
he	1
In	1
temples	1
and	1
at	1
altars,	1
when	1
the	1
priest	1
Turns	1
atheist,	1
as	1
did	1
Eli's	1
sons,	1
who	1
filled	1
With	1
lust	1
and	1
violence	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God?	1
In	1
courts	1
and	1
palaces	1
he	1
also	1
reigns,	1
And	1
in	1
luxurious	1
cities,	1
where	1
the	1
noise	1
Of	1
riot	1
ascends	1
above	1
their	1
loftiest	1
towers,	1
And	1
injury	1
and	1
outrage;	1
and,	1
when	1
night	1
Darkens	1
the	1
streets,	1
then	1
wander	1
forth	1
the	1
sons	1
Of	1
Belial,	1
flown	1
with	1
insolence	1
and	1
wine.	1
Witness	1
the	1
streets	1
of	1
Sodom,	1
and	1
that	1
night	1
In	1
Gibeah,	1
when	1
the	1
hospitable	1
door	1
Exposed	1
a	1
matron,	1
to	1
avoid	1
worse	1
rape.	1
These	1
were	1
the	1
prime	1
in	1
order	1
and	1
in	1
might:	1
The	1
rest	1
were	1
long	1
to	1
tell;	1
though	1
far	1
renowned	1
Th'	1
Ionian	1
gods--of	1
Javan's	1
issue	1
held	1
Gods,	1
yet	1
confessed	1
later	1
than	1
Heaven	1
and	1
Earth,	1
Their	1
boasted	1
parents;--Titan,	1
Heaven's	1
first-born,	1
With	1
his	1
enormous	1
brood,	1
and	1
birthright	1
seized	1
By	1
younger	1
Saturn:	1
he	1
from	1
mightier	1
Jove,	1
His	1
own	1
and	1
Rhea's	1
son,	1
like	1
measure	1
found;	1
So	1
Jove	1
usurping	1
reigned.	1
These,	1
first	1
in	1
Crete	1
And	1
Ida	1
known,	1
thence	1
on	1
the	1
snowy	1
top	1
Of	1
cold	1
Olympus	1
ruled	1
the	1
middle	1
air,	1
Their	1
highest	1
heaven;	1
or	1
on	1
the	1
Delphian	1
cliff,	1
Or	1
in	1
Dodona,	1
and	1
through	1
all	1
the	1
bounds	1
Of	1
Doric	1
land;	1
or	1
who	1
with	1
Saturn	1
old	1
Fled	1
over	1
Adria	1
to	1
th'	1
Hesperian	1
fields,	1
And	1
o'er	1
the	1
Celtic	1
roamed	1
the	1
utmost	1
Isles.	1
All	1
these	1
and	1
more	1
came	1
flocking;	1
but	1
with	1
looks	1
Downcast	1
and	1
damp;	1
yet	1
such	1
wherein	1
appeared	1
Obscure	1
some	1
glimpse	1
of	1
joy	1
to	1
have	1
found	1
their	1
Chief	1
Not	1
in	1
despair,	1
to	1
have	1
found	1
themselves	1
not	1
lost	1
In	1
loss	1
itself;	1
which	1
on	1
his	1
countenance	1
cast	1
Like	1
doubtful	1
hue.	1
But	1
he,	1
his	1
wonted	1
pride	1
Soon	1
recollecting,	1
with	1
high	1
words,	1
that	1
bore	1
Semblance	1
of	1
worth,	1
not	1
substance,	1
gently	1
raised	1
Their	1
fainting	1
courage,	1
and	1
dispelled	1
their	1
fears.	1
Then	1
straight	1
commands	1
that,	1
at	1
the	1
warlike	1
sound	1
Of	1
trumpets	1
loud	1
and	1
clarions,	1
be	1
upreared	1
His	1
mighty	1
standard.	1
That	1
proud	1
honour	1
claimed	1
Azazel	1
as	1
his	1
right,	1
a	1
Cherub	1
tall:	1
Who	1
forthwith	1
from	1
the	1
glittering	1
staff	1
unfurled	1
Th'	1
imperial	1
ensign;	1
which,	1
full	1
high	1
advanced,	1
Shone	1
like	1
a	1
meteor	1
streaming	1
to	1
the	1
wind,	1
With	1
gems	1
and	1
golden	1
lustre	1
rich	1
emblazed,	1
Seraphic	1
arms	1
and	1
trophies;	1
all	1
the	1
while	1
Sonorous	1
metal	1
blowing	1
martial	1
sounds:	1
At	1
which	1
the	1
universal	1
host	1
up-sent	1
A	1
shout	1
that	1
tore	1
Hell's	1
concave,	1
and	1
beyond	1
Frighted	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
Chaos	1
and	1
old	1
Night.	1
All	1
in	1
a	1
moment	1
through	1
the	1
gloom	1
were	1
seen	1
Ten	1
thousand	1
banners	1
rise	1
into	1
the	1
air,	1
With	1
orient	1
colours	1
waving:	1
with	1
them	1
rose	1
A	1
forest	1
huge	1
of	1
spears;	1
and	1
thronging	1
helms	1
Appeared,	1
and	1
serried	1
shields	1
in	1
thick	1
array	1
Of	1
depth	1
immeasurable.	1
Anon	1
they	1
move	1
In	1
perfect	1
phalanx	1
to	1
the	1
Dorian	1
mood	1
Of	1
flutes	1
and	1
soft	1
recorders--such	1
as	1
raised	1
To	1
height	1
of	1
noblest	1
temper	1
heroes	1
old	1
Arming	1
to	1
battle,	1
and	1
instead	1
of	1
rage	1
Deliberate	1
valour	1
breathed,	1
firm,	1
and	1
unmoved	1
With	1
dread	1
of	1
death	1
to	1
flight	1
or	1
foul	1
retreat;	1
Nor	1
wanting	1
power	1
to	1
mitigate	1
and	1
swage	1
With	1
solemn	1
touches	1
troubled	1
thoughts,	1
and	1
chase	1
Anguish	1
and	1
doubt	1
and	1
fear	1
and	1
sorrow	1
and	1
pain	1
From	1
mortal	1
or	1
immortal	1
minds.	1
Thus	1
they,	1
Breathing	1
united	1
force	1
with	1
fixed	1
thought,	1
Moved	1
on	1
in	1
silence	1
to	1
soft	1
pipes	1
that	1
charmed	1
Their	1
painful	1
steps	1
o'er	1
the	1
burnt	1
soil.	1
And	1
now	1
Advanced	1
in	1
view	1
they	1
stand--a	1
horrid	1
front	1
Of	1
dreadful	1
length	1
and	1
dazzling	1
arms,	1
in	1
guise	1
Of	1
warriors	1
old,	1
with	1
ordered	1
spear	1
and	1
shield,	1
Awaiting	1
what	1
command	1
their	1
mighty	1
Chief	1
Had	1
to	1
impose.	1
He	1
through	1
the	1
armed	1
files	1
Darts	1
his	1
experienced	1
eye,	1
and	1
soon	1
traverse	1
The	1
whole	1
battalion	1
views--their	1
order	1
due,	1
Their	1
visages	1
and	1
stature	1
as	1
of	1
gods;	1
Their	1
number	1
last	1
he	1
sums.	1
And	1
now	1
his	1
heart	1
Distends	1
with	1
pride,	1
and,	1
hardening	1
in	1
his	1
strength,	1
Glories:	1
for	1
never,	1
since	1
created	1
Man,	1
Met	1
such	1
embodied	1
force	1
as,	1
named	1
with	1
these,	1
Could	1
merit	1
more	1
than	1
that	1
small	1
infantry	1
Warred	1
on	1
by	1
cranes--though	1
all	1
the	1
giant	1
brood	1
Of	1
Phlegra	1
with	1
th'	1
heroic	1
race	1
were	1
joined	1
That	1
fought	1
at	1
Thebes	1
and	1
Ilium,	1
on	1
each	1
side	1
Mixed	1
with	1
auxiliar	1
gods;	1
and	1
what	1
resounds	1
In	1
fable	1
or	1
romance	1
of	1
Uther's	1
son,	1
Begirt	1
with	1
British	1
and	1
Armoric	1
knights;	1
And	1
all	1
who	1
since,	1
baptized	1
or	1
infidel,	1
Jousted	1
in	1
Aspramont,	1
or	1
Montalban,	1
Damasco,	1
or	1
Marocco,	1
or	1
Trebisond,	1
Or	1
whom	1
Biserta	1
sent	1
from	1
Afric	1
shore	1
When	1
Charlemain	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
peerage	1
fell	1
By	1
Fontarabbia.	1
Thus	1
far	1
these	1
beyond	1
Compare	1
of	1
mortal	1
prowess,	1
yet	1
observed	1
Their	1
dread	1
Commander.	1
He,	1
above	1
the	1
rest	1
In	1
shape	1
and	1
gesture	1
proudly	1
eminent,	1
Stood	1
like	1
a	1
tower.	1
His	1
form	1
had	1
yet	1
not	1
lost	1
All	1
her	1
original	1
brightness,	1
nor	1
appeared	1
Less	1
than	1
Archangel	1
ruined,	1
and	1
th'	1
excess	1
Of	1
glory	1
obscured:	1
as	1
when	1
the	1
sun	1
new-risen	1
Looks	1
through	1
the	1
horizontal	1
misty	1
air	1
Shorn	1
of	1
his	1
beams,	1
or,	1
from	1
behind	1
the	1
moon,	1
In	1
dim	1
eclipse,	1
disastrous	1
twilight	1
sheds	1
On	1
half	1
the	1
nations,	1
and	1
with	1
fear	1
of	1
change	1
Perplexes	1
monarchs.	1
Darkened	1
so,	1
yet	1
shone	1
Above	1
them	1
all	1
th'	1
Archangel:	1
but	1
his	1
face	1
Deep	1
scars	1
of	1
thunder	1
had	1
intrenched,	1
and	1
care	1
Sat	1
on	1
his	1
faded	1
cheek,	1
but	1
under	1
brows	1
Of	1
dauntless	1
courage,	1
and	1
considerate	1
pride	1
Waiting	1
revenge.	1
Cruel	1
his	1
eye,	1
but	1
cast	1
Signs	1
of	1
remorse	1
and	1
passion,	1
to	1
behold	1
The	1
fellows	1
of	1
his	1
crime,	1
the	1
followers	1
rather	1
(Far	1
other	1
once	1
beheld	1
in	1
bliss),	1
condemned	1
For	1
ever	1
now	1
to	1
have	1
their	1
lot	1
in	1
pain--	1
Millions	1
of	1
Spirits	1
for	1
his	1
fault	1
amerced	1
Of	1
Heaven,	1
and	1
from	1
eteranl	1
splendours	1
flung	1
For	1
his	1
revolt--yet	1
faithful	1
how	1
they	1
stood,	1
Their	1
glory	1
withered;	1
as,	1
when	1
heaven's	1
fire	1
Hath	1
scathed	1
the	1
forest	1
oaks	1
or	1
mountain	1
pines,	1
With	1
singed	1
top	1
their	1
stately	1
growth,	1
though	1
bare,	1
Stands	1
on	1
the	1
blasted	1
heath.	1
He	1
now	1
prepared	1
To	1
speak;	1
whereat	1
their	1
doubled	1
ranks	1
they	1
bend	1
From	1
wing	1
to	1
wing,	1
and	1
half	1
enclose	1
him	1
round	1
With	1
all	1
his	1
peers:	1
attention	1
held	1
them	1
mute.	1
Thrice	1
he	1
assayed,	1
and	1
thrice,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
scorn,	1
Tears,	1
such	1
as	1
Angels	1
weep,	1
burst	1
forth:	1
at	1

Words	1
interwove	1
with	1
sighs	1
found	1
out	1
their	1
way:--	1
"O	1
myriads	1
of	1
immortal	1
Spirits!	1
O	1
Powers	1
Matchless,	1
but	1
with	1
th'	1
Almighth!--and	1
that	1
strife	1
Was	1
not	1
inglorious,	1
though	1
th'	1
event	1
was	1
dire,	1
As	1
this	1
place	1
testifies,	1
and	1
this	1
dire	1
change,	1
Hateful	1
to	1
utter.	1
But	1
what	1
power	1
of	1
mind,	1
Forseeing	1
or	1
presaging,	1
from	1
the	1
depth	1
Of	1
knowledge	1
past	1
or	1
present,	1
could	1
have	1
feared	1
How	1
such	1
united	1
force	1
of	1
gods,	1
how	1
such	1
As	1
stood	1
like	1
these,	1
could	1
ever	1
know	1
repulse?	1
For	1
who	1
can	1
yet	1
believe,	1
though	1
after	1
loss,	1
That	1
all	1
these	1
puissant	1
legions,	1
whose	1
exile	1
Hath	1
emptied	1
Heaven,	1
shall	1
fail	1
to	1
re-ascend,	1
Self-raised,	1
and	1
repossess	1
their	1
native	1
seat?	1
For	1
me,	1
be	1
witness	1
all	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
Heaven,	1
If	1
counsels	1
different,	1
or	1
danger	1
shunned	1
By	1
me,	1
have	1
lost	1
our	1
hopes.	1
But	1
he	1
who	1
reigns	1
Monarch	1
in	1
Heaven	1
till	1
then	1
as	1
one	1
secure	1
Sat	1
on	1
his	1
throne,	1
upheld	1
by	1
old	1
repute,	1
Consent	1
or	1
custom,	1
and	1
his	1
regal	1
state	1
Put	1
forth	1
at	1
full,	1
but	1
still	1
his	1
strength	1
concealed--	1
Which	1
tempted	1
our	1
attempt,	1
and	1
wrought	1
our	1
fall.	1
Henceforth	1
his	1
might	1
we	1
know,	1
and	1
know	1
our	1
own,	1
So	1
as	1
not	1
either	1
to	1
provoke,	1
or	1
dread	1
New	1
war	1
provoked:	1
our	1
better	1
part	1
remains	1
To	1
work	1
in	1
close	1
design,	1
by	1
fraud	1
or	1
guile,	1
What	1
force	1
effected	1
not;	1
that	1
he	1
no	1
less	1
At	1
length	1
from	1
us	1
may	1
find,	1
who	1
overcomes	1
By	1
force	1
hath	1
overcome	1
but	1
half	1
his	1
foe.	1
Space	1
may	1
produce	1
new	1
Worlds;	1
whereof	1
so	1
rife	1
There	1
went	1
a	1
fame	1
in	1
Heaven	1
that	1
he	1
ere	1
long	1
Intended	1
to	1
create,	1
and	1
therein	1
plant	1
A	1
generation	1
whom	1
his	1
choice	1
regard	1
Should	1
favour	1
equal	1
to	1
the	1
Sons	1
of	1
Heaven.	1
Thither,	1
if	1
but	1
to	1
pry,	1
shall	1
be	1
perhaps	1
Our	1
first	1
eruption--thither,	1
or	1
elsewhere;	1
For	1
this	1
infernal	1
pit	1
shall	1
never	1
hold	1
Celestial	1
Spirits	1
in	1
bondage,	1
nor	1
th'	1
Abyss	1
Long	1
under	1
darkness	1
cover.	1
But	1
these	1
thoughts	1
Full	1
counsel	1
must	1
mature.	1
Peace	1
is	1
despaired;	1
For	1
who	1
can	1
think	1
submission?	1
War,	1
then,	1
war	1
Open	1
or	1
understood,	1
must	1
be	1
resolved."	1
He	1
spake;	1
and,	1
to	1
confirm	1
his	1
words,	1
outflew	1
Millions	1
of	1
flaming	1
swords,	1
drawn	1
from	1
the	1
thighs	1
Of	1
mighty	1
Cherubim;	1
the	1
sudden	1
blaze	1
Far	1
round	1
illumined	1
Hell.	1
Highly	1
they	1
raged	1
Against	1
the	1
Highest,	1
and	1
fierce	1
with	1
grasped	1
arms	1
Clashed	1
on	1
their	1
sounding	1
shields	1
the	1
din	1
of	1
war,	1
Hurling	1
defiance	1
toward	1
the	1
vault	1
of	1
Heaven.	1
There	1
stood	1
a	1
hill	1
not	1
far,	1
whose	1
grisly	1
top	1
Belched	1
fire	1
and	1
rolling	1
smoke;	1
the	1
rest	1
entire	1
Shone	1
with	1
a	1
glossy	1
scurf--undoubted	1
sign	1
That	1
in	1
his	1
womb	1
was	1
hid	1
metallic	1
ore,	1
The	1
work	1
of	1
sulphur.	1
Thither,	1
winged	1
with	1
speed,	1
A	1
numerous	1
brigade	1
hastened:	1
as	1
when	1
bands	1
Of	1
pioneers,	1
with	1
spade	1
and	1
pickaxe	1
armed,	1
Forerun	1
the	1
royal	1
camp,	1
to	1
trench	1
a	1
field,	1
Or	1
cast	1
a	1
rampart.	1
Mammon	1
led	1
them	1
on--	1
Mammon,	1
the	1
least	1
erected	1
Spirit	1
that	1
fell	1
From	1
Heaven;	1
for	1
even	1
in	1
Heaven	1
his	1
looks	1
and	1
thoughts	1
Were	1
always	1
downward	1
bent,	1
admiring	1
more	1
The	1
riches	1
of	1
heaven's	1
pavement,	1
trodden	1
gold,	1
Than	1
aught	1
divine	1
or	1
holy	1
else	1
enjoyed	1
In	1
vision	1
beatific.	1
By	1
him	1
first	1
Men	1
also,	1
and	1
by	1
his	1
suggestion	1
taught,	1
Ransacked	1
the	1
centre,	1
and	1
with	1
impious	1
hands	1
Rifled	1
the	1
bowels	1
of	1
their	1
mother	1
Earth	1
For	1
treasures	1
better	1
hid.	1
Soon	1
had	1
his	1
crew	1
Opened	1
into	1
the	1
hill	1
a	1
spacious	1
wound,	1
And	1
digged	1
out	1
ribs	1
of	1
gold.	1
Let	1
none	1
admire	1
That	1
riches	1
grow	1
in	1
Hell;	1
that	1
soil	1
may	1
best	1
Deserve	1
the	1
precious	1
bane.	1
And	1
here	1
let	1
those	1
Who	1
boast	1
in	1
mortal	1
things,	1
and	1
wondering	1
tell	1
Of	1
Babel,	1
and	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
Memphian	1
kings,	1
Learn	1
how	1
their	1
greatest	1
monuments	1
of	1
fame	1
And	1
strength,	1
and	1
art,	1
are	1
easily	1
outdone	1
By	1
Spirits	1
reprobate,	1
and	1
in	1
an	1
hour	1
What	1
in	1
an	1
age	1
they,	1
with	1
incessant	1
toil	1
And	1
hands	1
innumerable,	1
scarce	1
perform.	1
Nigh	1
on	1
the	1
plain,	1
in	1
many	1
cells	1
prepared,	1
That	1
underneath	1
had	1
veins	1
of	1
liquid	1
fire	1
Sluiced	1
from	1
the	1
lake,	1
a	1
second	1
multitude	1
With	1
wondrous	1
art	1
founded	1
the	1
massy	1
ore,	1
Severing	1
each	1
kind,	1
and	1
scummed	1
the	1
bullion-dross.	1
A	1
third	1
as	1
soon	1
had	1
formed	1
within	1
the	1
ground	1
A	1
various	1
mould,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
boiling	1
cells	1
By	1
strange	1
conveyance	1
filled	1
each	1
hollow	1
nook;	1
As	1
in	1
an	1
organ,	1
from	1
one	1
blast	1
of	1
wind,	1
To	1
many	1
a	1
row	1
of	1
pipes	1
the	1
sound-board	1
breathes.	1
Anon	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
a	1
fabric	1
huge	1
Rose	1
like	1
an	1
exhalation,	1
with	1
the	1
sound	1
Of	1
dulcet	1
symphonies	1
and	1
voices	1
sweet--	1
Built	1
like	1
a	1
temple,	1
where	1
pilasters	1
round	1
Were	1
set,	1
and	1
Doric	1
pillars	1
overlaid	1
With	1
golden	1
architrave;	1
nor	1
did	1
there	1
want	1
Cornice	1
or	1
frieze,	1
with	1
bossy	1
sculptures	1
graven;	1
The	1
roof	1
was	1
fretted	1
gold.	1
Not	1
Babylon	1
Nor	1
great	1
Alcairo	1
such	1
magnificence	1
Equalled	1
in	1
all	1
their	1
glories,	1
to	1
enshrine	1
Belus	1
or	1
Serapis	1
their	1
gods,	1
or	1
seat	1
Their	1
kings,	1
when	1
Egypt	1
with	1
Assyria	1
strove	1
In	1
wealth	1
and	1
luxury.	1
Th'	1
ascending	1
pile	1
Stood	1
fixed	1
her	1
stately	1
height,	1
and	1
straight	1
the	1
doors,	1
Opening	1
their	1
brazen	1
folds,	1
discover,	1
wide	1
Within,	1
her	1
ample	1
spaces	1
o'er	1
the	1
smooth	1
And	1
level	1
pavement:	1
from	1
the	1
arched	1
roof,	1
Pendent	1
by	1
subtle	1
magic,	1
many	1
a	1
row	1
Of	1
starry	1
lamps	1
and	1
blazing	1
cressets,	1
fed	1
With	1
naptha	1
and	1
asphaltus,	1
yielded	1
light	1
As	1
from	1
a	1
sky.	1
The	1
hasty	1
multitude	1
Admiring	1
entered;	1
and	1
the	1
work	1
some	1
praise,	1
And	1
some	1
the	1
architect.	1
His	1
hand	1
was	1
known	1
In	1
Heaven	1
by	1
many	1
a	1
towered	1
structure	1
high,	1
Where	1
sceptred	1
Angels	1
held	1
their	1
residence,	1
And	1
sat	1
as	1
Princes,	1
whom	1
the	1
supreme	1
King	1
Exalted	1
to	1
such	1
power,	1
and	1
gave	1
to	1
rule,	1
Each	1
in	1
his	1
Hierarchy,	1
the	1
Orders	1
bright.	1
Nor	1
was	1
his	1
name	1
unheard	1
or	1
unadored	1
In	1
ancient	1
Greece;	1
and	1
in	1
Ausonian	1
land	1
Men	1
called	1
him	1
Mulciber;	1
and	1
how	1
he	1
fell	1
From	1
Heaven	1
they	1
fabled,	1
thrown	1
by	1
angry	1
Jove	1
Sheer	1
o'er	1
the	1
crystal	1
battlements:	1
from	1
morn	1
To	1
noon	1
he	1
fell,	1
from	1
noon	1
to	1
dewy	1
eve,	1
A	1
summer's	1
day,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
setting	1
sun	1
Dropt	1
from	1
the	1
zenith,	1
like	1
a	1
falling	1
star,	1
On	1
Lemnos,	1
th'	1
Aegaean	1
isle.	1
Thus	1
they	1
relate,	1
Erring;	1
for	1
he	1
with	1
this	1
rebellious	1
rout	1
Fell	1
long	1
before;	1
nor	1
aught	1
aviled	1
him	1
now	1
To	1
have	1
built	1
in	1
Heaven	1
high	1
towers;	1
nor	1
did	1
he	1
scape	1
By	1
all	1
his	1
engines,	1
but	1
was	1
headlong	1
sent,	1
With	1
his	1
industrious	1
crew,	1
to	1
build	1
in	1
Hell.	1
Meanwhile	1
the	1
winged	1
Heralds,	1
by	1
command	1
Of	1
sovereign	1
power,	1
with	1
awful	1
ceremony	1
And	1
trumpet's	1
sound,	1
throughout	1
the	1
host	1
proclaim	1
A	1
solemn	1
council	1
forthwith	1
to	1
be	1
held	1
At	1
Pandemonium,	1
the	1
high	1
capital	1
Of	1
Satan	1
and	1
his	1
peers.	1
Their	1
summons	1
called	1
From	1
every	1
band	1
and	1
squared	1
regiment	1
By	1
place	1
or	1
choice	1
the	1
worthiest:	1
they	1
anon	1
With	1
hundreds	1
and	1
with	1
thousands	1
trooping	1
came	1
Attended.	1
All	1
access	1
was	1
thronged;	1
the	1
gates	1
And	1
porches	1
wide,	1
but	1
chief	1
the	1
spacious	1
hall	1
(Though	1
like	1
a	1
covered	1
field,	1
where	1
champions	1
bold	1
Wont	1
ride	1
in	1
armed,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
Soldan's	1
chair	1
Defied	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
Paynim	1
chivalry	1
To	1
mortal	1
combat,	1
or	1
career	1
with	1
lance),	1
Thick	1
swarmed,	1
both	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
air,	1
Brushed	1
with	1
the	1
hiss	1
of	1
rustling	1
wings.	1
As	1
bees	1
In	1
spring-time,	1
when	1
the	1
Sun	1
with	1
Taurus	1
rides.	1
Pour	1
forth	1
their	1
populous	1
youth	1
about	1
the	1
hive	1
In	1
clusters;	1
they	1
among	1
fresh	1
dews	1
and	1
flowers	1
Fly	1
to	1
and	1
fro,	1
or	1
on	1
the	1
smoothed	1
plank,	1
The	1
suburb	1
of	1
their	1
straw-built	1
citadel,	1
New	1
rubbed	1
with	1
balm,	1
expatiate,	1
and	1
confer	1
Their	1
state-affairs:	1
so	1
thick	1
the	1
airy	1
crowd	1
Swarmed	1
and	1
were	1
straitened;	1
till,	1
the	1
signal	1
given,	1
Behold	1
a	1
wonder!	1
They	1
but	1
now	1
who	1
seemed	1
In	1
bigness	1
to	1
surpass	1
Earth's	1
giant	1
sons,	1
Now	1
less	1
than	1
smallest	1
dwarfs,	1
in	1
narrow	1
room	1
Throng	1
numberless--like	1
that	1
pygmean	1
race	1
Beyond	1
the	1
Indian	1
mount;	1
or	1
faery	1
elves,	1
Whose	1
midnight	1
revels,	1
by	1
a	1
forest-side	1
Or	1
fountain,	1
some	1
belated	1
peasant	1
sees,	1
Or	1
dreams	1
he	1
sees,	1
while	1
overhead	1
the	1
Moon	1
Sits	1
arbitress,	1
and	1
nearer	1
to	1
the	1
Earth	1
Wheels	1
her	1
pale	1

they,	1
on	1
their	1
mirth	1

dance	1
Intent,	1
with	1
jocund	1
music	1
charm	1
his	1
ear;	1
At	1
once	1
with	1
joy	1
and	1
fear	1
his	1
heart	1
rebounds.	1
Thus	1
incorporeal	1
Spirits	1
to	1
smallest	1
forms	1
Reduced	1
their	1
shapes	1
immense,	1
and	1
were	1
at	1
large,	1
Though	1
without	1
number	1
still,	1
amidst	1
the	1
hall	1
Of	1
that	1
infernal	1
court.	1
But	1
far	1
within,	1
And	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
dimensions	1
like	1
themselves,	1
The	1
great	1
Seraphic	1
Lords	1
and	1
Cherubim	1
In	1
close	1
recess	1
and	1
secret	1
conclave	1
sat,	1
A	1
thousand	1
demi-gods	1
on	1
golden	1
seats,	1
Frequent	1
and	1
full.	1
After	1
short	1
silence	1
then,	1
And	1
summons	1
read,	1
the	1
great	1
consult	1
began.	1
Book	1

High	1

Outshone	1

Or	1

on	1

barbaric	1
pearl	1

Satan	1
exalted	1

by	1

raised	1
To	1
that	1

from	1

Thus	1
high	1
uplifted	1
beyond	1

aspires	1
Beyond	1
thus	1
high,	1
insatiate	1
to	1
pursue	1
Vain	1
war	1
with	1
Heaven;	1
and,	1
by	1
success	1
untaught,	1
His	1
proud	1
imaginations	1
thus	1
displayed:--	1
"Powers	1
and	1
Dominions,	1
Deities	1
of	1
Heaven!--	1
For,	1
since	1
no	1
deep	1
within	1

gulf	1
can	1
hold	1
Immortal	1
vigour,	1
though	1
oppressed	1

fallen,	1
I	1
give	1
not	1
Heaven	1
for	1
lost:	1
from	1
this	1
descent	1
Celestial	1
Virtues	1
rising	1
will	1
appear	1
More	1
glorious	1
and	1
more	1
dread	1
than	1
from	1
no	1

And	1
trust	1
themselves	1
to	1
fear	1
no	1

Me	1
though	1
just	1

been	1

hath	1
much	1
more	1
Established	1
in	1
a	1

Yielded	1
with	1
full	1
consent.	1
The	1
happier	1
state	1
In	1
Heaven,	1
which	1
follows	1
dignity,	1
might	1
draw	1
Envy	1
from	1
each	1
inferior;	1
but	1
who	1
here	1
Will	1
envy	1
whom	1
the	1
highest	1
place	1
exposes	1
Foremost	1
to	1
stand	1
against	1
the	1
Thunderer's	1
aim	1
Your	1

For	1
which	1
to	1
strive,	1
no	1
strife	1
can	1
grow	1
up	1
there	1
From	1
faction:	1
for	1
none	1
sure	1
will	1
claim	1
in	1
Hell	1
Precedence;	1
none	1
whose	1
portion	1
is	1
so	1
small	1
Of	1
present	1
pain	1
that	1
with	1
ambitious	1
mind	1
Will	1
covet	1
more!	1
With	1
this	1
advantage,	1
then,	1
To	1
union,	1
and	1
firm	1
faith,	1
and	1
firm	1
accord,	1
More	1
than	1
can	1
be	1
in	1
Heaven,	1
we	1
now	1
return	1
To	1
claim	1
our	1
just	1
inheritance	1
of	1
old,	1
Surer	1
to	1
prosper	1
than	1
prosperity	1
Could	1
have	1
assured	1
us;	1
and	1
by	1
what	1
best	1
way,	1
Whether	1
of	1
open	1
war	1
or	1
covert	1
guile,	1
We	1
now	1
debate.	1
Who	1
can	1
advise	1
may	1
speak."	1
He	1
ceased;	1
and	1
next	1
him	1
Moloch,	1
sceptred	1
king,	1
Stood	1
up--the	1
strongest	1
and	1
the	1
fiercest	1
Spirit	1
That	1
fought	1
in	1
Heaven,	1
now	1
fiercer	1
by	1
despair.	1
His	1
trust	1
was	1
with	1
th'	1
Eternal	1
to	1
be	1
deemed	1
Equal	1
in	1
strength,	1
and	1
rather	1
than	1
be	1
less	1
Cared	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
all;	1
with	1
that	1
care	1
lost	1
Went	1
all	1
his	1
fear:	1
of	1
God,	1
or	1
Hell,	1
or	1
worse,	1
He	1
recked	1
not,	1
and	1
these	1
words	1
thereafter	1
spake:--	1
"My	1
sentence	1
is	1
for	1
open	1
war.	1
Of	1
wiles,	1
More	1
unexpert,	1
I	1
boast	1
not:	1
them	1
let	1
those	1
Contrive	1
who	1
need,	1
or	1
when	1
they	1
need;	1
not	1
now.	1
For,	1
while	1
they	1
sit	1
contriving,	1
shall	1
the	1
rest--	1
Millions	1
that	1
stand	1
in	1
arms,	1
and	1
longing	1
wait	1
The	1
signal	1
to	1
ascend--sit	1
lingering	1
here,	1
Heaven's	1
fugitives,	1
and	1
for	1
their	1
dwelling-place	1
Accept	1
this	1
dark	1
opprobrious	1
den	1
of	1
shame,	1
The	1
prison	1
of	1
his	1
ryranny	1
who	1
reigns	1
By	1
our	1
delay?	1
No!	1
let	1
us	1
rather	1
choose,	1
Armed	1
with	1
Hell-flames	1
and	1
fury,	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
O'er	1
Heaven's	1
high	1
towers	1
to	1
force	1
resistless	1
way,	1
Turning	1
our	1
tortures	1
into	1
horrid	1
arms	1
Against	1
the	1
Torturer;	1
when,	1
to	1
meet	1
the	1
noise	1
Of	1
his	1
almighty	1
engine,	1
he	1
shall	1
hear	1
Infernal	1
thunder,	1
and,	1
for	1
lightning,	1
see	1
Black	1
fire	1
and	1
horror	1
shot	1
with	1
equal	1
rage	1
Among	1
his	1
Angels,	1
and	1
his	1
throne	1
itself	1
Mixed	1
with	1
Tartarean	1
sulphur	1
and	1
strange	1
fire,	1
His	1
own	1
invented	1
torments.	1
But	1
perhaps	1
The	1
way	1
seems	1
difficult,	1
and	1
steep	1
to	1
scale	1
With	1
upright	1
wing	1
against	1
a	1
higher	1
foe!	1
Let	1
such	1
bethink	1
them,	1
if	1
the	1
sleepy	1
drench	1
Of	1
that	1
forgetful	1
lake	1
benumb	1
not	1
still,	1
That	1
in	1
our	1
porper	1
motion	1
we	1
ascend	1
Up	1
to	1
our	1
native	1
seat;	1
descent	1
and	1
fall	1
To	1
us	1
is	1
adverse.	1
Who	1
but	1
felt	1
of	1
late,	1
When	1
the	1
fierce	1
foe	1
hung	1
on	1
our	1
broken	1
rear	1
Insulting,	1
and	1
pursued	1
us	1
through	1
the	1
Deep,	1
With	1
what	1
compulsion	1
and	1
laborious	1
flight	1
We	1
sunk	1
thus	1
low?	1
Th'	1
ascent	1
is	1
easy,	1
then;	1
Th'	1
event	1
is	1
feared!	1
Should	1
we	1
again	1
provoke	1
Our	1
stronger,	1
some	1
worse	1
way	1
his	1
wrath	1
may	1
find	1
To	1
our	1
destruction,	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
in	1
Hell	1
Fear	1
to	1
be	1
worse	1
destroyed!	1
What	1
can	1
be	1
worse	1
Than	1
to	1
dwell	1
here,	1
driven	1
out	1
from	1
bliss,	1
condemned	1
In	1
this	1
abhorred	1
deep	1
to	1
utter	1
woe!	1
Where	1
pain	1
of	1
unextinguishable	1
fire	1
Must	1
exercise	1
us	1
without	1
hope	1
of	1
end	1
The	1
vassals	1
of	1
his	1
anger,	1
when	1
the	1
scourge	1
Inexorably,	1
and	1
the	1
torturing	1
hour,	1
Calls	1
us	1
to	1
penance?	1
More	1
destroyed	1
than	1
thus,	1
We	1
should	1
be	1
quite	1
abolished,	1
and	1
expire.	1
What	1
fear	1
we	1
then?	1
what	1
doubt	1
we	1
to	1
incense	1
His	1
utmost	1
ire?	1
which,	1
to	1
the	1
height	1
enraged,	1
Will	1
either	1
quite	1
consume	1
us,	1
and	1
reduce	1
To	1
nothing	1
this	1
essential--happier	1
far	1
Than	1
miserable	1
to	1
have	1
eternal	1
being!--	1
Or,	1
if	1
our	1
substance	1
be	1
indeed	1
divine,	1
And	1
cannot	1
cease	1
to	1
be,	1
we	1
are	1
at	1
worst	1
On	1
this	1
side	1
nothing;	1
and	1
by	1
proof	1
we	1
feel	1
Our	1
power	1
sufficient	1
to	1
disturb	1
his	1
Heaven,	1
And	1
with	1
perpetual	1
inroads	1
to	1
alarm,	1
Though	1
inaccessible,	1
his	1
fatal	1
throne:	1
Which,	1
if	1
not	1
victory,	1
is	1
yet	1
revenge."	1
He	1
ended	1
frowning,	1
and	1
his	1
look	1
denounced	1
Desperate	1
revenge,	1
and	1
battle	1
dangerous	1
To	1
less	1
than	1
gods.	1
On	1
th'	1
other	1
side	1
up	1
rose	1
Belial,	1
in	1
act	1
more	1
graceful	1
and	1
humane.	1
A	1
fairer	1
person	1
lost	1
not	1
Heaven;	1
he	1
seemed	1
For	1
dignity	1
composed,	1
and	1
high	1
exploit.	1
But	1
all	1
was	1
false	1
and	1
hollow;	1
though	1
his	1
tongue	1
Dropped	1
manna,	1
and	1
could	1
make	1
the	1
worse	1
appear	1
The	1
better	1
reason,	1
to	1
perplex	1
and	1
dash	1
Maturest	1
counsels:	1
for	1
his	1
thoughts	1
were	1
low--	1
To	1
vice	1
industrious,	1
but	1
to	1
nobler	1
deeds	1
Timorous	1
and	1
slothful.	1
Yet	1
he	1
pleased	1
the	1
ear,	1
And	1
with	1
persuasive	1
accent	1
thus	1
began:--	1
"I	1
should	1
be	1
much	1
for	1
open	1
war,	1
O	1
Peers,	1
As	1
not	1
behind	1
in	1
hate,	1
if	1
what	1
was	1
urged	1
Main	1
reason	1
to	1
persuade	1
immediate	1
war	1
Did	1
not	1
dissuade	1
me	1
most,	1
and	1
seem	1
to	1
cast	1
Ominous	1
conjecture	1
on	1
the	1
whole	1
success;	1
When	1
he	1
who	1
most	1
excels	1
in	1
fact	1
of	1
arms,	1
In	1
what	1
he	1
counsels	1
and	1
in	1
what	1
excels	1
Mistrustful,	1
grounds	1
his	1
courage	1
on	1
despair	1
And	1
utter	1
dissolution,	1
as	1
the	1
scope	1
Of	1
all	1
his	1
aim,	1
after	1
some	1
dire	1
revenge.	1
First,	1
what	1
revenge?	1
The	1
towers	1
of	1
Heaven	1
are	1
filled	1
With	1
armed	1
watch,	1
that	1
render	1
all	1
access	1
Impregnable:	1
oft	1
on	1
the	1
bodering	1
Deep	1
Encamp	1
their	1
legions,	1
or	1
with	1
obscure	1
wing	1
Scout	1
far	1
and	1
wide	1
into	1
the	1
realm	1
of	1
Night,	1
Scorning	1
surprise.	1
Or,	1
could	1
we	1
break	1
our	1
way	1
By	1
force,	1
and	1
at	1
our	1
heels	1
all	1
Hell	1
should	1
rise	1
With	1
blackest	1
insurrection	1
to	1
confound	1
Heaven's	1
purest	1
light,	1
yet	1
our	1
great	1
Enemy,	1
All	1
incorruptible,	1
would	1
on	1
his	1
throne	1
Sit	1
unpolluted,	1
and	1
th'	1
ethereal	1
mould,	1
Incapable	1
of	1
stain,	1
would	1
soon	1
expel	1
Her	1
mischief,	1
and	1
purge	1
off	1
the	1
baser	1
fire,	1
Victorious.	1
Thus	1
repulsed,	1
our	1
final	1
hope	1
Is	1
flat	1
despair:	1
we	1
must	1
exasperate	1
Th'	1
Almighty	1
Victor	1
to	1
spend	1
all	1
his	1
rage;	1
And	1
that	1
must	1
end	1
us;	1
that	1
must	1
be	1
our	1
cure--	1
To	1
be	1
no	1
more.	1
Sad	1
cure!	1
for	1
who	1
would	1
lose,	1
Though	1
full	1
of	1
pain,	1
this	1
intellectual	1
being,	1
Those	1
thoughts	1
that	1
wander	1
through	1
eternity,	1
To	1
perish	1
rather,	1
swallowed	1
up	1
and	1
lost	1
In	1
the	1
wide	1
womb	1
of	1
uncreated	1
Night,	1
Devoid	1
of	1
sense	1
and	1
motion?	1
And	1
who	1
knows,	1
Let	1
this	1
be	1
good,	1
whether	1
our	1
angry	1
Foe	1
Can	1
give	1
it,	1
or	1
will	1
ever?	1
How	1
he	1
can	1
Is	1
doubtful;	1
that	1
he	1
never	1
will	1
is	1
sure.	1
Will	1
he,	1
so	1
wise,	1
let	1
loose	1
at	1
once	1
his	1
ire,	1
Belike	1
through	1
impotence	1
or	1
unaware,	1
To	1
give	1
his	1
enemies	1
their	1
wish,	1
and	1
end	1
Them	1
in	1
his	1
anger	1
whom	1
his	1
anger	1
saves	1
To	1
punish	1
endless?	1
'Wherefore	1
cease	1
we,	1
then?'	1
Say	1
they	1
who	1
counsel	1
war;	1
'we	1
are	1
decreed,	1
Reserved,	1
and	1
destined	1
to	1
eternal	1
woe;	1
Whatever	1
doing,	1
what	1
can	1
we	1
suffer	1
more,	1
What	1
can	1
we	1
suffer	1
worse?'	1
Is	1
this,	1
then,	1
worst--	1
Thus	1
sitting,	1
thus	1
consulting,	1
thus	1
in	1
arms?	1
What	1
when	1
we	1
fled	1
amain,	1
pursued	1
and	1
struck	1
With	1
Heaven's	1
afflicting	1
thunder,	1
and	1
besought	1
The	1
Deep	1
to	1
shelter	1
us?	1
This	1
Hell	1
then	1
seemed	1
A	1
refuge	1
from	1
those	1
wounds.	1
Or	1
when	1
we	1
lay	1
Chained	1
on	1
the	1
burning	1
lake?	1
That	1
sure	1
was	1
worse.	1
What	1
if	1
the	1
breath	1
that	1
kindled	1
those	1
grim	1
fires,	1
Awaked,	1
should	1
blow	1
them	1
into	1
sevenfold	1
rage,	1
And	1
plunge	1
us	1
in	1
the	1
flames;	1
or	1
from	1
above	1
Should	1
intermitted	1
vengeance	1
arm	1
again	1
His	1
red	1
right	1
hand	1
to	1
plague	1
us?	1
What	1
if	1
all	1
Her	1
stores	1
were	1
opened,	1
and	1
this	1
firmament	1
Of	1
Hell	1
should	1
spout	1
her	1
cataracts	1
of	1
fire,	1
Impendent	1
horrors,	1
threatening	1
hideous	1
fall	1
One	1
day	1
upon	1
our	1
heads;	1
while	1
we	1
perhaps,	1
Designing	1
or	1
exhorting	1
glorious	1
war,	1
Caught	1
in	1
a	1
fiery	1
tempest,	1
shall	1
be	1
hurled,	1
Each	1
on	1
his	1
rock	1
transfixed,	1
the	1
sport	1
and	1
prey	1
Or	1
racking	1
whirlwinds,	1
or	1
for	1
ever	1
sunk	1
Under	1
yon	1
boiling	1
ocean,	1
wrapt	1
in	1
chains,	1
There	1
to	1
converse	1
with	1
everlasting	1
groans,	1
Unrespited,	1
unpitied,	1
unreprieved,	1
Ages	1
of	1
hopeless	1
end?	1
This	1
would	1
be	1
worse.	1
War,	1
therefore,	1
open	1
or	1
concealed,	1
alike	1
My	1
voice	1
dissuades;	1
for	1
what	1
can	1
force	1
or	1
guile	1
With	1
him,	1
or	1
who	1
deceive	1
his	1
mind,	1
whose	1
eye	1
Views	1
all	1
things	1
at	1
one	1
view?	1
He	1
from	1
Heaven's	1
height	1
All	1
these	1
our	1
motions	1
vain	1
sees	1
and	1
derides,	1
Not	1
more	1
almighty	1
to	1
resist	1
our	1
might	1
Than	1
wise	1
to	1
frustrate	1
all	1
our	1
plots	1
and	1
wiles.	1
Shall	1
we,	1
then,	1
live	1
thus	1
vile--the	1
race	1
of	1
Heaven	1
Thus	1
trampled,	1
thus	1
expelled,	1
to	1
suffer	1
here	1
Chains	1
and	1
these	1
torments?	1
Better	1
these	1
than	1
worse,	1
By	1
my	1
advice;	1
since	1
fate	1
inevitable	1
Subdues	1
us,	1
and	1
omnipotent	1
decree,	1
The	1
Victor's	1
will.	1
To	1
suffer,	1
as	1
to	1
do,	1
Our	1
strength	1
is	1
equal;	1
nor	1
the	1
law	1
unjust	1
That	1
so	1
ordains.	1
This	1
was	1
at	1
first	1
resolved,	1
If	1
we	1
were	1
wise,	1
against	1
so	1
great	1
a	1
foe	1
Contending,	1
and	1
so	1
doubtful	1
what	1
might	1
fall.	1
I	1
laugh	1
when	1
those	1
who	1
at	1
the	1
spear	1
are	1
bold	1
And	1
venturous,	1
if	1
that	1
fail	1
them,	1
shrink,	1
and	1
fear	1
What	1
yet	1
they	1
know	1
must	1
follow--to	1
endure	1
Exile,	1
or	1
igominy,	1
or	1
bonds,	1
or	1
pain,	1
The	1
sentence	1
of	1
their	1
Conqueror.	1
This	1
is	1
now	1
Our	1
doom;	1
which	1
if	1
we	1
can	1
sustain	1
and	1
bear,	1
Our	1
Supreme	1
Foe	1
in	1
time	1
may	1
much	1
remit	1
His	1
anger,	1
and	1
perhaps,	1
thus	1
far	1
removed,	1
Not	1
mind	1
us	1
not	1
offending,	1
satisfied	1
With	1
what	1
is	1
punished;	1
whence	1
these	1
raging	1
fires	1
Will	1
slacken,	1
if	1
his	1
breath	1
stir	1
not	1
their	1
flames.	1
Our	1
purer	1
essence	1
then	1
will	1
overcome	1
Their	1
noxious	1
vapour;	1
or,	1
inured,	1
not	1
feel;	1
Or,	1
changed	1
at	1
length,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
conformed	1
In	1
temper	1
and	1
in	1
nature,	1
will	1
receive	1
Familiar	1
the	1
fierce	1
heat;	1
and,	1
void	1
of	1
pain,	1
This	1
horror	1
will	1
grow	1
mild,	1
this	1
darkness	1
light;	1
Besides	1
what	1
hope	1
the	1
never-ending	1
flight	1
Of	1
future	1
days	1
may	1
bring,	1
what	1
chance,	1
what	1
change	1
Worth	1
waiting--since	1
our	1
present	1
lot	1
appears	1
For	1
happy	1
though	1
but	1
ill,	1
for	1
ill	1
not	1
worst,	1
If	1
we	1
procure	1
not	1
to	1
ourselves	1
more	1
woe."	1
Thus	1
Belial,	1
with	1
words	1
clothed	1
in	1
reason's	1
garb,	1
Counselled	1
ignoble	1
ease	1
and	1
peaceful	1
sloth,	1
Not	1
peace;	1
and	1
after	1
him	1
thus	1
Mammon	1
spake:--	1
"Either	1
to	1
disenthrone	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
Heaven	1
We	1
war,	1
if	1
war	1
be	1
best,	1
or	1
to	1
regain	1
Our	1
own	1
right	1
lost.	1
Him	1
to	1
unthrone	1
we	1
then	1
May	1
hope,	1
when	1
everlasting	1
Fate	1
shall	1
yield	1
To	1
fickle	1
Chance,	1
and	1
Chaos	1
judge	1
the	1
strife.	1
The	1
former,	1
vain	1
to	1
hope,	1
argues	1
as	1
vain	1
The	1
latter;	1
for	1
what	1
place	1
can	1
be	1
for	1
us	1
Within	1
Heaven's	1
bound,	1
unless	1
Heaven's	1
Lord	1
supreme	1
We	1
overpower?	1
Suppose	1
he	1
should	1
relent	1
And	1
publish	1
grace	1
to	1
all,	1
on	1
promise	1
made	1
Of	1
new	1
subjection;	1
with	1
what	1
eyes	1
could	1
we	1
Stand	1
in	1
his	1
presence	1
humble,	1
and	1
receive	1
Strict	1
laws	1
imposed,	1
to	1
celebrate	1
his	1
throne	1
With	1
warbled	1
hymns,	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
Godhead	1
sing	1
Forced	1
hallelujahs,	1
while	1
he	1
lordly	1
sits	1
Our	1
envied	1
sovereign,	1
and	1
his	1
altar	1
breathes	1
Ambrosial	1
odours	1
and	1
ambrosial	1
flowers,	1
Our	1
servile	1
offerings?	1
This	1
must	1
be	1
our	1
task	1
In	1
Heaven,	1
this	1
our	1
delight.	1
How	1
wearisome	1
Eternity	1
so	1
spent	1
in	1
worship	1
paid	1
To	1
whom	1
we	1
hate!	1
Let	1
us	1
not	1
then	1
pursue,	1
By	1
force	1
impossible,	1
by	1
leave	1
obtained	1
Unacceptable,	1
though	1
in	1
Heaven,	1
our	1
state	1
Of	1
splendid	1
vassalage;	1
but	1
rather	1
seek	1
Our	1
own	1
good	1
from	1
ourselves,	1
and	1
from	1
our	1
own	1
Live	1
to	1
ourselves,	1
though	1
in	1
this	1
vast	1
recess,	1
Free	1
and	1
to	1
none	1
accountable,	1
preferring	1
Hard	1
liberty	1
before	1
the	1
easy	1
yoke	1
Of	1
servile	1
pomp.	1
Our	1
greatness	1
will	1
appear	1
Then	1
most	1
conspicuous	1
when	1
great	1
things	1
of	1
small,	1
Useful	1
of	1
hurtful,	1
prosperous	1
of	1
adverse,	1
We	1
can	1
create,	1
and	1
in	1
what	1
place	1
soe'er	1
Thrive	1
under	1
evil,	1
and	1
work	1
ease	1
out	1
of	1
pain	1
Through	1
labour	1
and	1
endurance.	1
This	1
deep	1
world	1
Of	1
darkness	1
do	1
we	1
dread?	1
How	1
oft	1
amidst	1
Thick	1
clouds	1
and	1
dark	1
doth	1
Heaven's	1
all-ruling	1
Sire	1
Choose	1
to	1
reside,	1
his	1
glory	1
unobscured,	1
And	1
with	1
the	1
majesty	1
of	1
darkness	1
round	1
Covers	1
his	1
throne,	1
from	1
whence	1
deep	1
thunders	1
roar.	1
Mustering	1
their	1
rage,	1
and	1
Heaven	1
resembles	1
Hell!	1
As	1
he	1
our	1
darkness,	1
cannot	1
we	1
his	1
light	1
Imitate	1
when	1
we	1
please?	1
This	1
desert	1
soil	1
Wants	1
not	1
her	1
hidden	1
lustre,	1
gems	1
and	1
gold;	1
Nor	1
want	1
we	1
skill	1
or	1
art	1
from	1
whence	1
to	1
raise	1
Magnificence;	1
and	1
what	1
can	1
Heaven	1
show	1
more?	1
Our	1
torments	1
also	1
may,	1
in	1
length	1
of	1
time,	1
Become	1
our	1
elements,	1
these	1
piercing	1
fires	1
As	1
soft	1
as	1
now	1
severe,	1
our	1
temper	1
changed	1
Into	1
their	1
temper;	1
which	1
must	1
needs	1
remove	1
The	1
sensible	1
of	1
pain.	1
All	1
things	1
invite	1
To	1
peaceful	1
counsels,	1
and	1
the	1
settled	1
state	1
Of	1
order,	1
how	1
in	1
safety	1
best	1
we	1
may	1
Compose	1
our	1
present	1
evils,	1
with	1
regard	1
Of	1
what	1
we	1
are	1
and	1
where,	1
dismissing	1
quite	1
All	1
thoughts	1
of	1
war.	1
Ye	1
have	1
what	1
I	1
advise."	1
He	1
scarce	1
had	1
finished,	1
when	1
such	1
murmur	1
filled	1
Th'	1
assembly	1
as	1
when	1
hollow	1
rocks	1
retain	1
The	1
sound	1
of	1
blustering	1
winds,	1
which	1
all	1
night	1
long	1
Had	1
roused	1
the	1
sea,	1
now	1
with	1
hoarse	1
cadence	1
lull	1
Seafaring	1
men	1
o'erwatched,	1
whose	1
bark	1
by	1
chance	1
Or	1
pinnace,	1
anchors	1
in	1
a	1
craggy	1
bay	1
After	1
the	1
tempest.	1
Such	1
applause	1
was	1
heard	1
As	1
Mammon	1
ended,	1
and	1
his	1
sentence	1
pleased,	1
Advising	1
peace:	1
for	1
such	1
another	1
field	1
They	1
dreaded	1
worse	1
than	1
Hell;	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
fear	1
Of	1
thunder	1
and	1
the	1
sword	1
of	1
Michael	1
Wrought	1
still	1
within	1
them;	1
and	1
no	1
less	1
desire	1
To	1
found	1
this	1
nether	1
empire,	1
which	1
might	1
rise,	1
By	1
policy	1
and	1
long	1
process	1
of	1
time,	1
In	1
emulation	1
opposite	1
to	1
Heaven.	1
Which	1
when	1
Beelzebub	1
perceived--than	1
whom,	1
Satan	1
except,	1
none	1
higher	1
sat--with	1
grave	1
Aspect	1
he	1
rose,	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
rising	1
seemed	1
A	1
pillar	1
of	1
state.	1
Deep	1
on	1
his	1
front	1
engraven	1
Deliberation	1
sat,	1
and	1
public	1
care;	1
And	1
princely	1
counsel	1
in	1
his	1
face	1
yet	1
shone,	1
Majestic,	1
though	1
in	1
ruin.	1
Sage	1
he	1
stood	1
With	1
Atlantean	1
shoulders,	1
fit	1
to	1
bear	1
The	1
weight	1
of	1
mightiest	1
monarchies;	1
his	1
look	1
Drew	1
audience	1
and	1
attention	1
still	1
as	1
night	1
Or	1
summer's	1
noontide	1
air,	1
while	1
thus	1
he	1
spake:--	1
"Thrones	1
and	1
Imperial	1
Powers,	1
Offspring	1
of	1
Heaven,	1
Ethereal	1
Virtues!	1
or	1
these	1
titles	1
now	1
Must	1
we	1
renounce,	1
and,	1
changing	1
style,	1
be	1
called	1
Princes	1
of	1
Hell?	1
for	1
so	1
the	1
popular	1
vote	1
Inclines--here	1
to	1
continue,	1
and	1
build	1
up	1
here	1
A	1
growing	1
empire;	1
doubtless!	1
while	1
we	1
dream,	1
And	1
know	1
not	1
that	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
Heaven	1
hath	1
doomed	1
This	1
place	1
our	1
dungeon,	1
not	1
our	1
safe	1
retreat	1
Beyond	1
his	1
potent	1
arm,	1
to	1
live	1
exempt	1
From	1
Heaven's	1
high	1
jurisdiction,	1
in	1
new	1
league	1
Banded	1
against	1
his	1
throne,	1
but	1
to	1
remain	1
In	1
strictest	1
bondage,	1
though	1
thus	1
far	1
removed,	1
Under	1
th'	1
inevitable	1
curb,	1
reserved	1
His	1
captive	1
multitude.	1
For	1
he,	1
to	1
be	1
sure,	1
In	1
height	1
or	1
depth,	1
still	1
first	1
and	1
last	1
will	1
reign	1
Sole	1
king,	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
kingdom	1
lose	1
no	1
part	1
By	1
our	1
revolt,	1
but	1
over	1
Hell	1
extend	1
His	1
empire,	1
and	1
with	1
iron	1
sceptre	1
rule	1
Us	1
here,	1
as	1
with	1
his	1
golden	1
those	1
in	1
Heaven.	1
What	1
sit	1
we	1
then	1
projecting	1
peace	1
and	1
war?	1
War	1
hath	1
determined	1
us	1
and	1
foiled	1
with	1
loss	1
Irreparable;	1
terms	1
of	1
peace	1
yet	1
none	1
Vouchsafed	1
or	1
sought;	1
for	1
what	1
peace	1
will	1
be	1
given	1
To	1
us	1
enslaved,	1
but	1
custody	1
severe,	1
And	1
stripes	1
and	1
arbitrary	1
punishment	1
Inflicted?	1
and	1
what	1
peace	1
can	1
we	1
return,	1
But,	1
to	1
our	1
power,	1
hostility	1
and	1
hate,	1
Untamed	1
reluctance,	1
and	1
revenge,	1
though	1
slow,	1
Yet	1
ever	1
plotting	1
how	1
the	1
Conqueror	1
least	1
May	1
reap	1
his	1
conquest,	1
and	1
may	1
least	1
rejoice	1
In	1
doing	1
what	1
we	1
most	1
in	1
suffering	1
feel?	1
Nor	1
will	1
occasion	1
want,	1
nor	1
shall	1
we	1
need	1
With	1
dangerous	1
expedition	1
to	1
invade	1
Heaven,	1
whose	1
high	1
walls	1
fear	1
no	1
assault	1
or	1
siege,	1
Or	1
ambush	1
from	1
the	1
Deep.	1
What	1
if	1
we	1
find	1
Some	1
easier	1
enterprise?	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
place	1
(If	1
ancient	1
and	1
prophetic	1
fame	1
in	1
Heaven	1
Err	1
not)--another	1
World,	1
the	1
happy	1
seat	1
Of	1
some	1
new	1
race,	1
called	1
Man,	1
about	1
this	1
time	1
To	1
be	1
created	1
like	1
to	1
us,	1
though	1
less	1
In	1
power	1
and	1
excellence,	1
but	1
favoured	1
more	1
Of	1
him	1
who	1
rules	1
above;	1
so	1
was	1
his	1
will	1
Pronounced	1
among	1
the	1
Gods,	1
and	1
by	1
an	1
oath	1
That	1
shook	1
Heaven's	1
whole	1
circumference	1
confirmed.	1
Thither	1
let	1
us	1
bend	1
all	1
our	1
thoughts,	1
to	1
learn	1
What	1
creatures	1
there	1
inhabit,	1
of	1
what	1
mould	1
Or	1
substance,	1
how	1
endued,	1
and	1
what	1
their	1
power	1
And	1
where	1
their	1
weakness:	1
how	1
attempted	1
best,	1
By	1
force	1
of	1
subtlety.	1
Though	1
Heaven	1
be	1
shut,	1
And	1
Heaven's	1
high	1
Arbitrator	1
sit	1
secure	1
In	1
his	1
own	1
strength,	1
this	1
place	1
may	1
lie	1
exposed,	1
The	1
utmost	1
border	1
of	1
his	1
kingdom,	1
left	1
To	1
their	1
defence	1
who	1
hold	1
it:	1
here,	1
perhaps,	1
Some	1
advantageous	1
act	1
may	1
be	1
achieved	1
By	1
sudden	1
onset--either	1
with	1
Hell-fire	1
To	1
waste	1
his	1
whole	1
creation,	1
or	1
possess	1
All	1
as	1
our	1
own,	1
and	1
drive,	1
as	1
we	1
were	1
driven,	1
The	1
puny	1
habitants;	1
or,	1
if	1
not	1
drive,	1
Seduce	1
them	1
to	1
our	1
party,	1
that	1
their	1
God	1
May	1
prove	1
their	1
foe,	1
and	1
with	1
repenting	1
hand	1
Abolish	1
his	1
own	1
works.	1
This	1
would	1
surpass	1
Common	1
revenge,	1
and	1
interrupt	1
his	1
joy	1
In	1
our	1
confusion,	1
and	1
our	1
joy	1
upraise	1
In	1
his	1
disturbance;	1
when	1
his	1
darling	1
sons,	1
Hurled	1
headlong	1
to	1
partake	1
with	1
us,	1
shall	1
curse	1
Their	1
frail	1
original,	1
and	1
faded	1
bliss--	1
Faded	1
so	1
soon!	1
Advise	1
if	1
this	1
be	1
worth	1
Attempting,	1
or	1
to	1
sit	1
in	1
darkness	1
here	1
Hatching	1
vain	1
empires."	1
Thus	1
beelzebub	1
Pleaded	1
his	1
devilish	1
counsel--first	1
devised	1
By	1
Satan,	1
and	1
in	1
part	1
proposed:	1
for	1
whence,	1
But	1
from	1
the	1
author	1
of	1
all	1
ill,	1
could	1
spring	1
So	1
deep	1
a	1
malice,	1
to	1
confound	1
the	1
race	1
Of	1
mankind	1
in	1
one	1
root,	1
and	1
Earth	1
with	1
Hell	1
To	1
mingle	1
and	1
involve,	1
done	1
all	1
to	1
spite	1
The	1
great	1
Creator?	1
But	1
their	1
spite	1
still	1
serves	1
His	1
glory	1
to	1
augment.	1
The	1
bold	1
design	1
Pleased	1
highly	1
those	1
infernal	1
States,	1
and	1
joy	1
Sparkled	1
in	1
all	1
their	1
eyes:	1
with	1
full	1
assent	1
They	1
vote:	1
whereat	1
his	1
speech	1
he	1
thus	1
renews:--	1
"Well	1
have	1
ye	1
judged,	1
well	1
ended	1
long	1
debate,	1
Synod	1
of	1
Gods,	1
and,	1
like	1
to	1
what	1
ye	1
are,	1
Great	1
things	1
resolved,	1
which	1
from	1
the	1
lowest	1
deep	1
Will	1
once	1
more	1
lift	1
us	1
up,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
fate,	1
Nearer	1
our	1
ancient	1
seat--perhaps	1
in	1
view	1
Of	1
those	1
bright	1
confines,	1
whence,	1
with	1
neighbouring	1
arms,	1
And	1
opportune	1
excursion,	1
we	1
may	1
chance	1
Re-enter	1
Heaven;	1
or	1
else	1
in	1
some	1
mild	1
zone	1
Dwell,	1
not	1
unvisited	1
of	1
Heaven's	1
fair	1
light,	1
Secure,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
brightening	1
orient	1
beam	1
Purge	1
off	1
this	1
gloom:	1
the	1
soft	1
delicious	1
air,	1
To	1
heal	1
the	1
scar	1
of	1
these	1
corrosive	1
fires,	1
Shall	1
breathe	1
her	1
balm.	1
But,	1
first,	1
whom	1
shall	1
we	1
send	1
In	1
search	1
of	1
this	1
new	1
World?	1
whom	1
shall	1
we	1
find	1
Sufficient?	1
who	1
shall	1
tempt	1
with	1
wandering	1
feet	1
The	1
dark,	1
unbottomed,	1
infinite	1
Abyss,	1
And	1
through	1
the	1
palpable	1
obscure	1
find	1
out	1
His	1
uncouth	1
way,	1
or	1
spread	1
his	1
airy	1
flight,	1
Upborne	1
with	1
indefatigable	1
wings	1
Over	1
the	1
vast	1
abrupt,	1
ere	1
he	1
arrive	1
The	1
happy	1
Isle?	1
What	1
strength,	1
what	1
art,	1
can	1
then	1
Suffice,	1
or	1
what	1
evasion	1
bear	1
him	1
safe,	1
Through	1
the	1
strict	1
senteries	1
and	1
stations	1
thick	1
Of	1
Angels	1
watching	1
round?	1
Here	1
he	1
had	1
need	1
All	1
circumspection:	1
and	1
we	1
now	1
no	1
less	1
Choice	1
in	1
our	1
suffrage;	1
for	1
on	1
whom	1
we	1
send	1
The	1
weight	1
of	1
all,	1
and	1
our	1
last	1
hope,	1
relies."	1
This	1
said,	1
he	1
sat;	1
and	1
expectation	1
held	1
His	1
look	1
suspense,	1
awaiting	1
who	1
appeared	1
To	1
second,	1
or	1
oppose,	1
or	1
undertake	1
The	1
perilous	1
attempt.	1
But	1
all	1
sat	1
mute,	1
Pondering	1
the	1
danger	1
with	1
deep	1
thoughts;	1
and	1
each	1
In	1
other's	1
countenance	1
read	1
his	1
own	1
dismay,	1
Astonished.	1
None	1
among	1
the	1
choice	1
and	1
prime	1
Of	1
those	1
Heaven-warring	1
champions	1
could	1
be	1
found	1
So	1
hardy	1
as	1
to	1
proffer	1
or	1
accept,	1
Alone,	1
the	1
dreadful	1
voyage;	1
till,	1
at	1
last,	1
Satan,	1
whom	1
now	1
transcendent	1
glory	1
raised	1
Above	1
his	1
fellows,	1
with	1
monarchal	1
pride	1
Conscious	1
of	1
highest	1
worth,	1
unmoved	1
thus	1
spake:--	1
"O	1
Progeny	1
of	1
Heaven!	1
Empyreal	1
Thrones!	1
With	1
reason	1
hath	1
deep	1
silence	1
and	1
demur	1
Seized	1
us,	1
though	1
undismayed.	1
Long	1
is	1
the	1
way	1
And	1
hard,	1
that	1
out	1
of	1
Hell	1
leads	1
up	1
to	1
light.	1
Our	1
prison	1
strong,	1
this	1
huge	1
convex	1
of	1
fire,	1
Outrageous	1
to	1
devour,	1
immures	1
us	1
round	1
Ninefold;	1
and	1
gates	1
of	1
burning	1
adamant,	1
Barred	1
over	1
us,	1
prohibit	1
all	1
egress.	1
These	1
passed,	1
if	1
any	1
pass,	1
the	1
void	1
profound	1
Of	1
unessential	1
Night	1
receives	1
him	1
next,	1
Wide-gaping,	1
and	1
with	1
utter	1
loss	1
of	1
being	1
Threatens	1
him,	1
plunged	1
in	1
that	1
abortive	1
gulf.	1
If	1
thence	1
he	1
scape,	1
into	1
whatever	1
world,	1
Or	1
unknown	1
region,	1
what	1
remains	1
him	1
less	1
Than	1
unknown	1
dangers,	1
and	1
as	1
hard	1
escape?	1
But	1
I	1
should	1
ill	1
become	1
this	1
throne,	1
O	1
Peers,	1
And	1
this	1
imperial	1
sovereignty,	1
adorned	1
With	1
splendour,	1
armed	1
with	1
power,	1
if	1
aught	1
proposed	1
And	1
judged	1
of	1
public	1
moment	1
in	1
the	1
shape	1
Of	1
difficulty	1
or	1
danger,	1
could	1
deter	1
Me	1
from	1
attempting.	1
Wherefore	1
do	1
I	1
assume	1
These	1
royalties,	1
and	1
not	1
refuse	1
to	1
reign,	1
Refusing	1
to	1
accept	1
as	1
great	1
a	1
share	1
Of	1
hazard	1
as	1
of	1
honour,	1
due	1
alike	1
To	1
him	1
who	1
reigns,	1
and	1
so	1
much	1
to	1
him	1
due	1
Of	1
hazard	1
more	1
as	1
he	1
above	1
the	1
rest	1
High	1
honoured	1
sits?	1
Go,	1
therefore,	1
mighty	1
Powers,	1
Terror	1
of	1
Heaven,	1
though	1
fallen;	1
intend	1
at	1
home,	1
While	1
here	1
shall	1
be	1
our	1
home,	1
what	1
best	1
may	1
ease	1
The	1
present	1
misery,	1
and	1
render	1
Hell	1
More	1
tolerable;	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
cure	1
or	1
charm	1
To	1
respite,	1
or	1
deceive,	1
or	1
slack	1
the	1
pain	1
Of	1
this	1
ill	1
mansion:	1
intermit	1
no	1
watch	1
Against	1
a	1
wakeful	1
foe,	1
while	1
I	1
abroad	1
Through	1
all	1
the	1
coasts	1
of	1
dark	1
destruction	1
seek	1
Deliverance	1
for	1
us	1
all.	1
This	1
enterprise	1
None	1
shall	1
partake	1
with	1
me."	1
Thus	1
saying,	1
rose	1
The	1
Monarch,	1
and	1
prevented	1
all	1
reply;	1
Prudent	1
lest,	1
from	1
his	1
resolution	1
raised,	1
Others	1
among	1
the	1
chief	1
might	1
offer	1
now,	1
Certain	1
to	1
be	1
refused,	1
what	1
erst	1
they	1
feared,	1
And,	1
so	1
refused,	1
might	1
in	1
opinion	1
stand	1
His	1
rivals,	1
winning	1
cheap	1
the	1
high	1
repute	1
Which	1
he	1
through	1
hazard	1
huge	1
must	1
earn.	1
But	1
they	1
Dreaded	1
not	1
more	1
th'	1
adventure	1
than	1
his	1
voice	1
Forbidding;	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
with	1
him	1
they	1
rose.	1
Their	1
rising	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
was	1
as	1
the	1
sound	1
Of	1
thunder	1
heard	1
remote.	1
Towards	1
him	1
they	1
bend	1
With	1
awful	1
reverence	1
prone,	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
God	1
Extol	1
him	1
equal	1
to	1
the	1
Highest	1
in	1
Heaven.	1
Nor	1
failed	1
they	1
to	1
express	1
how	1
much	1
they	1
praised	1
That	1
for	1
the	1
general	1
safety	1
he	1
despised	1
His	1
own:	1
for	1
neither	1
do	1
the	1
Spirits	1
damned	1
Lose	1
all	1
their	1
virtue;	1
lest	1
bad	1
men	1
should	1
boast	1
Their	1
specious	1
deeds	1
on	1
earth,	1
which	1
glory	1
excites,	1
Or	1
close	1
ambition	1
varnished	1
o'er	1
with	1
zeal.	1
Thus	1
they	1
their	1
doubtful	1
consultations	1
dark	1
Ended,	1
rejoicing	1
in	1
their	1
matchless	1
Chief:	1
As,	1
when	1
from	1
mountain-tops	1
the	1
dusky	1
clouds	1
Ascending,	1
while	1
the	1
north	1
wind	1
sleeps,	1
o'erspread	1
Heaven's	1
cheerful	1
face,	1
the	1
louring	1
element	1
Scowls	1
o'er	1
the	1
darkened	1
landscape	1
snow	1
or	1
shower,	1
If	1
chance	1
the	1
radiant	1
sun,	1
with	1
farewell	1
sweet,	1
Extend	1
his	1
evening	1
beam,	1
the	1
fields	1
revive,	1
The	1
birds	1
their	1
notes	1
renew,	1
and	1
bleating	1
herds	1
Attest	1
their	1
joy,	1
that	1
hill	1
and	1
valley	1
rings.	1
O	1
shame	1
to	1
men!	1
Devil	1
with	1
devil	1
damned	1
Firm	1
concord	1
holds;	1
men	1
only	1
disagree	1
Of	1
creatures	1
rational,	1
though	1
under	1
hope	1
Of	1
heavenly	1
grace,	1
and,	1
God	1
proclaiming	1
peace,	1
Yet	1
live	1
in	1
hatred,	1
enmity,	1
and	1
strife	1
Among	1
themselves,	1
and	1
levy	1
cruel	1
wars	1
Wasting	1
the	1
earth,	1
each	1
other	1
to	1
destroy:	1
As	1
if	1
(which	1
might	1
induce	1
us	1
to	1
accord)	1
Man	1
had	1
not	1
hellish	1
foes	1
enow	1
besides,	1
That	1
day	1
and	1
night	1
for	1
his	1
destruction	1
wait!	1
The	1
Stygian	1
council	1
thus	1
dissolved;	1
and	1
forth	1
In	1
order	1
came	1
the	1
grand	1
infernal	1
Peers:	1
Midst	1
came	1
their	1
mighty	1
Paramount,	1
and	1
seemed	1
Alone	1
th'	1
antagonist	1
of	1
Heaven,	1
nor	1
less	1
Than	1
Hell's	1
dread	1
Emperor,	1
with	1
pomp	1
supreme,	1
And	1
god-like	1
imitated	1
state:	1
him	1
round	1
A	1
globe	1
of	1
fiery	1
Seraphim	1
enclosed	1
With	1
bright	1
emblazonry,	1
and	1
horrent	1
arms.	1
Then	1
of	1
their	1
session	1
ended	1
they	1
bid	1
cry	1
With	1
trumpet's	1
regal	1
sound	1
the	1
great	1
result:	1
Toward	1
the	1
four	1
winds	1
four	1
speedy	1
Cherubim	1
Put	1
to	1
their	1
mouths	1
the	1
sounding	1
alchemy,	1
By	1
herald's	1
voice	1
explained;	1
the	1
hollow	1
Abyss	1
Heard	1
far	1
adn	1
wide,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
Hell	1
With	1
deafening	1
shout	1
returned	1
them	1
loud	1
acclaim.	1
Thence	1
more	1
at	1
ease	1
their	1
minds,	1
and	1
somewhat	1
raised	1
By	1
false	1
presumptuous	1
hope,	1
the	1
ranged	1
Powers	1
Disband;	1
and,	1
wandering,	1
each	1
his	1
several	1
way	1
Pursues,	1
as	1
inclination	1
or	1
sad	1
choice	1
Leads	1
him	1
perplexed,	1
where	1
he	1
may	1
likeliest	1
find	1
Truce	1
to	1
his	1
restless	1
thoughts,	1
and	1
entertain	1
The	1
irksome	1
hours,	1
till	1
his	1
great	1
Chief	1
return.	1
Part	1
on	1
the	1
plain,	1
or	1
in	1
the	1
air	1
sublime,	1
Upon	1
the	1
wing	1
or	1
in	1
swift	1
race	1
contend,	1
As	1
at	1
th'	1
Olympian	1
games	1
or	1
Pythian	1
fields;	1
Part	1
curb	1
their	1
fiery	1
steeds,	1
or	1
shun	1
the	1
goal	1
With	1
rapid	1
wheels,	1
or	1
fronted	1
brigades	1
form:	1
As	1
when,	1
to	1
warn	1
proud	1
cities,	1
war	1
appears	1
Waged	1
in	1
the	1
troubled	1
sky,	1
and	1
armies	1
rush	1
To	1
battle	1
in	1
the	1
clouds;	1
before	1
each	1
van	1
Prick	1
forth	1
the	1
airy	1
knights,	1
and	1
couch	1
their	1
spears,	1
Till	1
thickest	1
legions	1
close;	1
with	1
feats	1
of	1
arms	1
From	1
either	1
end	1
of	1
heaven	1
the	1
welkin	1
burns.	1
Others,	1
with	1
vast	1
Typhoean	1
rage,	1
more	1
fell,	1
Rend	1
up	1
both	1
rocks	1
and	1
hills,	1
and	1
ride	1
the	1
air	1
In	1
whirlwind;	1
Hell	1
scarce	1
holds	1
the	1
wild	1
uproar:--	1
As	1
when	1
Alcides,	1
from	1
Oechalia	1
crowned	1
With	1
conquest,	1
felt	1
th'	1
envenomed	1
robe,	1
and	1
tore	1
Through	1
pain	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
roots	1
Thessalian	1
pines,	1
And	1
Lichas	1
from	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
Oeta	1
threw	1
Into	1
th'	1
Euboic	1
sea.	1
Others,	1
more	1
mild,	1
Retreated	1
in	1
a	1
silent	1
valley,	1
sing	1
With	1
notes	1
angelical	1
to	1
many	1
a	1
harp	1
Their	1
own	1
heroic	1
deeds,	1
and	1
hapless	1
fall	1
By	1
doom	1
of	1
battle,	1
and	1
complain	1
that	1
Fate	1
Free	1
Virtue	1
should	1
enthrall	1
to	1
Force	1
or	1
Chance.	1
Their	1
song	1
was	1
partial;	1
but	1
the	1
harmony	1
(What	1
could	1
it	1
less	1
when	1
Spirits	1
immortal	1
sing?)	1
Suspended	1
Hell,	1
and	1
took	1
with	1
ravishment	1
The	1
thronging	1
audience.	1
In	1
discourse	1
more	1
sweet	1
(For	1
Eloquence	1
the	1
Soul,	1
Song	1
charms	1
the	1
Sense)	1
Others	1
apart	1
sat	1
on	1
a	1
hill	1
retired,	1
In	1
thoughts	1
more	1
elevate,	1
and	1
reasoned	1
high	1
Of	1
Providence,	1
Foreknowledge,	1
Will,	1
and	1
Fate--	1
Fixed	1
fate,	1
free	1
will,	1
foreknowledge	1
absolute,	1
And	1
found	1
no	1
end,	1
in	1
wandering	1
mazes	1
lost.	1
Of	1
good	1
and	1
evil	1
much	1
they	1
argued	1
then,	1
Of	1
happiness	1
and	1
final	1
misery,	1
Passion	1
and	1
apathy,	1
and	1
glory	1
and	1
shame:	1
Vain	1
wisdom	1
all,	1
and	1
false	1
philosophy!--	1
Yet,	1
with	1
a	1
pleasing	1
sorcery,	1
could	1
charm	1
Pain	1
for	1
a	1
while	1
or	1
anguish,	1
and	1
excite	1
Fallacious	1
hope,	1
or	1
arm	1
th'	1
obdured	1
breast	1
With	1
stubborn	1
patience	1
as	1
with	1
triple	1
steel.	1
Another	1
part,	1
in	1
squadrons	1
and	1
gross	1
bands,	1
On	1
bold	1
adventure	1
to	1
discover	1
wide	1
That	1
dismal	1
world,	1
if	1
any	1
clime	1
perhaps	1
Might	1
yield	1
them	1
easier	1
habitation,	1
bend	1
Four	1
ways	1
their	1
flying	1
march,	1
along	1
the	1
banks	1
Of	1
four	1
infernal	1
rivers,	1
that	1
disgorge	1
Into	1
the	1
burning	1
lake	1
their	1
baleful	1
streams--	1
Abhorred	1
Styx,	1
the	1
flood	1
of	1
deadly	1
hate;	1
Sad	1
Acheron	1
of	1
sorrow,	1
black	1
and	1
deep;	1
Cocytus,	1
named	1
of	1
lamentation	1
loud	1
Heard	1
on	1
the	1
rueful	1
stream;	1
fierce	1
Phlegeton,	1
Whose	1
waves	1
of	1
torrent	1
fire	1
inflame	1
with	1
rage.	1
Far	1
off	1
from	1
these,	1
a	1
slow	1
and	1
silent	1
stream,	1
Lethe,	1
the	1
river	1
of	1
oblivion,	1
rolls	1
Her	1
watery	1
labyrinth,	1
whereof	1
who	1
drinks	1
Forthwith	1
his	1
former	1
state	1
and	1
being	1
forgets--	1
Forgets	1
both	1
joy	1
and	1
grief,	1
pleasure	1
and	1
pain.	1
Beyond	1
this	1
flood	1
a	1
frozen	1
continent	1
Lies	1
dark	1
and	1
wild,	1
beat	1
with	1
perpetual	1
storms	1
Of	1
whirlwind	1
and	1
dire	1
hail,	1
which	1
on	1
firm	1
land	1
Thaws	1
not,	1
but	1
gathers	1
heap,	1
and	1
ruin	1
seems	1
Of	1
ancient	1
pile;	1
all	1
else	1
deep	1
snow	1
and	1
ice,	1
A	1
gulf	1
profound	1
as	1
that	1
Serbonian	1
bog	1
Betwixt	1
Damiata	1
and	1
Mount	1
Casius	1
old,	1
Where	1
armies	1
whole	1
have	1
sunk:	1
the	1
parching	1
air	1
Burns	1
frore,	1
and	1
cold	1
performs	1
th'	1
effect	1
of	1
fire.	1
Thither,	1
by	1
harpy-footed	1
Furies	1
haled,	1
At	1
certain	1
revolutions	1
all	1
the	1
damned	1
Are	1
brought;	1
and	1
feel	1
by	1
turns	1
the	1
bitter	1
change	1
Of	1
fierce	1
extremes,	1
extremes	1
by	1
change	1
more	1
fierce,	1
From	1
beds	1
of	1
raging	1
fire	1
to	1
starve	1
in	1
ice	1
Their	1
soft	1
ethereal	1
warmth,	1
and	1
there	1
to	1
pine	1
Immovable,	1
infixed,	1
and	1
frozen	1
round	1
Periods	1
of	1
time,--thence	1
hurried	1
back	1
to	1
fire.	1
They	1
ferry	1
over	1
this	1
Lethean	1
sound	1
Both	1
to	1
and	1
fro,	1
their	1
sorrow	1
to	1
augment,	1
And	1
wish	1
and	1
struggle,	1
as	1
they	1
pass,	1
to	1
reach	1
The	1
tempting	1
stream,	1
with	1
one	1
small	1
drop	1
to	1
lose	1
In	1
sweet	1
forgetfulness	1
all	1
pain	1
and	1
woe,	1
All	1
in	1
one	1
moment,	1
and	1
so	1
near	1
the	1
brink;	1
But	1
Fate	1
withstands,	1
and,	1
to	1
oppose	1
th'	1
attempt,	1
Medusa	1
with	1
Gorgonian	1
terror	1
guards	1
The	1
ford,	1
and	1
of	1
itself	1
the	1
water	1
flies	1
All	1
taste	1
of	1
living	1
wight,	1
as	1
once	1
it	1
fled	1
The	1
lip	1
of	1
Tantalus.	1
Thus	1
roving	1
on	1
In	1
confused	1
march	1
forlorn,	1
th'	1
adventurous	1
bands,	1
With	1
shuddering	1
horror	1
pale,	1
and	1
eyes	1
aghast,	1
Viewed	1
first	1
their	1
lamentable	1
lot,	1
and	1
found	1
No	1
rest.	1
Through	1
many	1
a	1
dark	1
and	1
dreary	1
vale	1
They	1
passed,	1
and	1
many	1
a	1
region	1
dolorous,	1
O'er	1
many	1
a	1
frozen,	1
many	1
a	1
fiery	1
alp,	1
Rocks,	1
caves,	1
lakes,	1
fens,	1
bogs,	1
dens,	1
and	1
shades	1
of	1
death--	1
A	1
universe	1
of	1
death,	1
which	1
God	1
by	1
curse	1
Created	1
evil,	1
for	1
evil	1
only	1
good;	1
Where	1
all	1
life	1
dies,	1
death	1
lives,	1
and	1
Nature	1
breeds,	1
Perverse,	1
all	1
monstrous,	1
all	1
prodigious	1
things,	1
Obominable,	1
inutterable,	1
and	1
worse	1
Than	1
fables	1
yet	1
have	1
feigned	1
or	1
fear	1
conceived,	1
Gorgons,	1
and	1
Hydras,	1
and	1
Chimeras	1
dire.	1
Meanwhile	1
the	1
Adversary	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
Man,	1
Satan,	1
with	1
thoughts	1
inflamed	1
of	1
highest	1
design,	1
Puts	1
on	1
swift	1
wings,	1
and	1
toward	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
Hell	1
Explores	1
his	1
solitary	1
flight:	1
sometimes	1
He	1
scours	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
coast,	1
sometimes	1
the	1
left;	1
Now	1
shaves	1
with	1
level	1
wing	1
the	1
deep,	1
then	1
soars	1
Up	1
to	1
the	1
fiery	1
concave	1
towering	1
high.	1
As	1
when	1
far	1
off	1
at	1
sea	1
a	1
fleet	1
descried	1
Hangs	1
in	1
the	1
clouds,	1
by	1
equinoctial	1
winds	1
Close	1
sailing	1
from	1
Bengala,	1
or	1
the	1
isles	1
Of	1
Ternate	1
and	1
Tidore,	1
whence	1
merchants	1
bring	1
Their	1
spicy	1
drugs;	1
they	1
on	1
the	1
trading	1
flood,	1
Through	1
the	1
wide	1
Ethiopian	1
to	1
the	1
Cape,	1
Ply	1
stemming	1
nightly	1
toward	1
the	1
pole:	1
so	1
seemed	1
Far	1
off	1
the	1
flying	1
Fiend.	1
At	1
last	1
appear	1
Hell-bounds,	1
high	1
reaching	1
to	1
the	1
horrid	1
roof,	1
And	1
thrice	1
threefold	1
the	1
gates;	1
three	1
folds	1
were	1
brass,	1
Three	1
iron,	1
three	1
of	1
adamantine	1
rock,	1
Impenetrable,	1
impaled	1
with	1
circling	1
fire,	1
Yet	1
unconsumed.	1
Before	1
the	1
gates	1
there	1
sat	1
On	1
either	1
side	1
a	1
formidable	1
Shape.	1
The	1
one	1
seemed	1
woman	1
to	1
the	1
waist,	1
and	1
fair,	1
But	1
ended	1
foul	1
in	1
many	1
a	1
scaly	1
fold,	1
Voluminous	1
and	1
vast--a	1
serpent	1
armed	1
With	1
mortal	1
sting.	1
About	1
her	1
middle	1
round	1
A	1
cry	1
of	1
Hell-hounds	1
never-ceasing	1
barked	1
With	1
wide	1
Cerberean	1
mouths	1
full	1
loud,	1
and	1
rung	1
A	1
hideous	1
peal;	1
yet,	1
when	1
they	1
list,	1
would	1
creep,	1
If	1
aught	1
disturbed	1
their	1
noise,	1
into	1
her	1
womb,	1
And	1
kennel	1
there;	1
yet	1
there	1
still	1
barked	1
and	1
howled	1
Within	1
unseen.	1
Far	1
less	1
abhorred	1
than	1
these	1
Vexed	1
Scylla,	1
bathing	1
in	1
the	1
sea	1
that	1
parts	1
Calabria	1
from	1
the	1
hoarse	1
Trinacrian	1
shore;	1
Nor	1
uglier	1
follow	1
the	1
night-hag,	1
when,	1
called	1
In	1
secret,	1
riding	1
through	1
the	1
air	1
she	1
comes,	1
Lured	1
with	1
the	1
smell	1
of	1
infant	1
blood,	1
to	1
dance	1
With	1
Lapland	1
witches,	1
while	1
the	1
labouring	1
moon	1
Eclipses	1
at	1
their	1
charms.	1
The	1
other	1
Shape--	1
If	1
shape	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
called	1
that	1
shape	1
had	1
none	1
Distinguishable	1
in	1
member,	1
joint,	1
or	1
limb;	1
Or	1
substance	1
might	1
be	1
called	1
that	1
shadow	1
seemed,	1
For	1
each	1
seemed	1
either--black	1
it	1
stood	1
as	1
Night,	1
Fierce	1
as	1
ten	1
Furies,	1
terrible	1
as	1
Hell,	1
And	1
shook	1
a	1
dreadful	1
dart:	1
what	1
seemed	1
his	1
head	1
The	1
likeness	1
of	1
a	1
kingly	1
crown	1
had	1
on.	1
Satan	1
was	1
now	1
at	1
hand,	1
and	1
from	1
his	1
seat	1
The	1
monster	1
moving	1
onward	1
came	1
as	1
fast	1
With	1
horrid	1
strides;	1
Hell	1
trembled	1
as	1
he	1
strode.	1
Th'	1
undaunted	1
Fiend	1
what	1
this	1
might	1
be	1
admired--	1
Admired,	1
not	1
feared	1
(God	1
and	1
his	1
Son	1
except,	1
Created	1
thing	1
naught	1
valued	1
he	1
nor	1
shunned),	1
And	1
with	1
disdainful	1
look	1
thus	1
first	1
began:--	1
"Whence	1
and	1
what	1
art	1
thou,	1
execrable	1
Shape,	1
That	1
dar'st,	1
though	1
grim	1
and	1
terrible,	1
advance	1
Thy	1
miscreated	1
front	1
athwart	1
my	1
way	1
To	1
yonder	1
gates?	1
Through	1
them	1
I	1
mean	1
to	1
pass,	1
That	1
be	1
assured,	1
without	1
leave	1
asked	1
of	1
thee.	1
Retire;	1
or	1
taste	1
thy	1
folly,	1
and	1
learn	1
by	1
proof,	1
Hell-born,	1
not	1
to	1
contend	1
with	1
Spirits	1
of	1
Heaven."	1
To	1
whom	1
the	1
Goblin,	1
full	1
of	1
wrath,	1
replied:--	1
"Art	1
thou	1
that	1
traitor	1
Angel?	1
art	1
thou	1
he,	1
Who	1
first	1
broke	1
peace	1
in	1
Heaven	1
and	1
faith,	1
till	1
then	1
Unbroken,	1
and	1
in	1
proud	1
rebellious	1
arms	1
Drew	1
after	1
him	1
the	1
third	1
part	1
of	1
Heaven's	1
sons,	1
Conjured	1
against	1
the	1
Highest--for	1
which	1
both	1
thou	1
And	1
they,	1
outcast	1
from	1
God,	1
are	1
here	1
condemned	1
To	1
waste	1
eternal	1
days	1
in	1
woe	1
and	1
pain?	1
And	1
reckon'st	1
thou	1
thyself	1
with	1
Spirits	1
of	1
Heaven	1
Hell-doomed,	1
and	1
breath'st	1
defiance	1
here	1
and	1
scorn,	1
Where	1
I	1
reign	1
king,	1
and,	1
to	1
enrage	1
thee	1
more,	1
Thy	1
king	1
and	1
lord?	1
Back	1
to	1
thy	1
punishment,	1
False	1
fugitive;	1
and	1
to	1
thy	1
speed	1
add	1
wings,	1
Lest	1
with	1
a	1
whip	1
of	1
scorpions	1
I	1
pursue	1
Thy	1
lingering,	1
or	1
with	1
one	1
stroke	1
of	1
this	1
dart	1
Strange	1
horror	1
seize	1
thee,	1
and	1
pangs	1
unfelt	1
before."	1
So	1
spake	1
the	1
grisly	1
Terror,	1
and	1
in	1
shape,	1
So	1
speaking	1
and	1
so	1
threatening,	1
grew	1
tenfold,	1
More	1
dreadful	1
and	1
deform.	1
On	1
th'	1
other	1
side,	1
Incensed	1
with	1
indignation,	1
Satan	1
stood	1
Unterrified,	1
and	1
like	1
a	1
comet	1
burned,	1
That	1
fires	1
the	1
length	1
of	1
Ophiuchus	1
huge	1
In	1
th'	1
arctic	1
sky,	1
and	1
from	1
his	1
horrid	1
hair	1
Shakes	1
pestilence	1
and	1
war.	1
Each	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
Levelled	1
his	1
deadly	1
aim;	1
their	1
fatal	1
hands	1
No	1
second	1
stroke	1
intend;	1
and	1
such	1
a	1
frown	1
Each	1
cast	1
at	1
th'	1
other	1
as	1
when	1
two	1
black	1
clouds,	1
With	1
heaven's	1
artillery	1
fraught,	1
came	1
rattling	1
on	1
Over	1
the	1
Caspian,--then	1
stand	1
front	1
to	1
front	1
Hovering	1
a	1
space,	1
till	1
winds	1
the	1
signal	1
blow	1
To	1
join	1
their	1
dark	1
encounter	1
in	1
mid-air.	1
So	1
frowned	1
the	1
mighty	1
combatants	1
that	1
Hell	1
Grew	1
darker	1
at	1
their	1
frown;	1
so	1
matched	1
they	1
stood;	1
For	1
never	1
but	1
once	1
more	1
was	1
wither	1
like	1
To	1
meet	1
so	1
great	1
a	1
foe.	1
And	1
now	1
great	1
deeds	1
Had	1
been	1
achieved,	1
whereof	1
all	1
Hell	1
had	1
rung,	1
Had	1
not	1
the	1
snaky	1
Sorceress,	1
that	1
sat	1
Fast	1
by	1
Hell-gate	1
and	1
kept	1
the	1
fatal	1
key,	1
Risen,	1
and	1
with	1
hideous	1
outcry	1
rushed	1
between.	1
"O	1
father,	1
what	1
intends	1
thy	1
hand,"	1
she	1
cried,	1
"Against	1
thy	1
only	1
son?	1
What	1
fury,	1
O	1
son,	1
Possesses	1
thee	1
to	1
bend	1
that	1
mortal	1
dart	1
Against	1
thy	1
father's	1
head?	1
And	1
know'st	1
for	1
whom?	1
For	1
him	1
who	1
sits	1
above,	1
and	1
laughs	1
the	1
while	1
At	1
thee,	1
ordained	1
his	1
drudge	1
to	1
execute	1
Whate'er	1
his	1
wrath,	1
which	1
he	1
calls	1
justice,	1
bids--	1
His	1
wrath,	1
which	1
one	1
day	1
will	1
destroy	1
ye	1
both!"	1
She	1
spake,	1
and	1
at	1
her	1
words	1
the	1
hellish	1
Pest	1
Forbore:	1
then	1
these	1
to	1
her	1
Satan	1
returned:--	1
"So	1
strange	1
thy	1
outcry,	1
and	1
thy	1
words	1
so	1
strange	1
Thou	1
interposest,	1
that	1
my	1
sudden	1
hand,	1
Prevented,	1
spares	1
to	1
tell	1
thee	1
yet	1
by	1
deeds	1
What	1
it	1
intends,	1
till	1
first	1
I	1
know	1
of	1
thee	1
What	1
thing	1
thou	1
art,	1
thus	1
double-formed,	1
and	1
why,	1
In	1
this	1
infernal	1
vale	1
first	1
met,	1
thou	1
call'st	1
Me	1
father,	1
and	1
that	1
phantasm	1
call'st	1
my	1
son.	1
I	1
know	1
thee	1
not,	1
nor	1
ever	1
saw	1
till	1
now	1
Sight	1
more	1
detestable	1
than	1
him	1
and	1
thee."	1
T'	1
whom	1
thus	1
the	1
Portress	1
of	1
Hell-gate	1
replied:--	1
"Hast	1
thou	1
forgot	1
me,	1
then;	1
and	1
do	1
I	1
seem	1
Now	1
in	1
thine	1
eye	1
so	1
foul?--once	1
deemed	1
so	1
fair	1
In	1
Heaven,	1
when	1
at	1
th'	1
assembly,	1
and	1
in	1
sight	1
Of	1
all	1
the	1
Seraphim	1
with	1
thee	1
combined	1
In	1
bold	1
conspiracy	1
against	1
Heaven's	1
King,	1
All	1
on	1
a	1
sudden	1
miserable	1
pain	1
Surprised	1
thee,	1
dim	1
thine	1
eyes	1
and	1
dizzy	1
swum	1
In	1
darkness,	1
while	1
thy	1
head	1
flames	1
thick	1
and	1
fast	1
Threw	1
forth,	1
till	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
side	1
opening	1
wide,	1
Likest	1
to	1
thee	1
in	1
shape	1
and	1
countenance	1
bright,	1
Then	1
shining	1
heavenly	1
fair,	1
a	1
goddess	1
armed,	1
Out	1
of	1
thy	1
head	1
I	1
sprung.	1
Amazement	1
seized	1
All	1
th'	1
host	1
of	1
Heaven;	1
back	1
they	1
recoiled	1
afraid	1
At	1
first,	1
and	1
called	1
me	1
Sin,	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
sign	1
Portentous	1
held	1
me;	1
but,	1
familiar	1
grown,	1
I	1
pleased,	1
and	1
with	1
attractive	1
graces	1
won	1
The	1
most	1
averse--thee	1
chiefly,	1
who,	1
full	1
oft	1
Thyself	1
in	1
me	1
thy	1
perfect	1
image	1
viewing,	1
Becam'st	1
enamoured;	1
and	1
such	1
joy	1
thou	1
took'st	1
With	1
me	1
in	1
secret	1
that	1
my	1
womb	1
conceived	1
A	1
growing	1
burden.	1
Meanwhile	1
war	1
arose,	1
And	1
fields	1
were	1
fought	1
in	1
Heaven:	1
wherein	1
remained	1
(For	1
what	1
could	1
else?)	1
to	1
our	1
Almighty	1
Foe	1
Clear	1
victory;	1
to	1
our	1
part	1
loss	1
and	1
rout	1
Through	1
all	1
the	1
Empyrean.	1
Down	1
they	1
fell,	1
Driven	1
headlong	1
from	1
the	1
pitch	1
of	1
Heaven,	1
down	1
Into	1
this	1
Deep;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
general	1
fall	1
I	1
also:	1
at	1
which	1
time	1
this	1
powerful	1
key	1
Into	1
my	1
hands	1
was	1
given,	1
with	1
charge	1
to	1
keep	1
These	1
gates	1
for	1
ever	1
shut,	1
which	1
none	1
can	1
pass	1
Without	1
my	1
opening.	1
Pensive	1
here	1
I	1
sat	1
Alone;	1
but	1
long	1
I	1
sat	1
not,	1
till	1
my	1
womb,	1
Pregnant	1
by	1
thee,	1
and	1
now	1
excessive	1
grown,	1
Prodigious	1
motion	1
felt	1
and	1
rueful	1
throes.	1
At	1
last	1
this	1
odious	1
offspring	1
whom	1
thou	1
seest,	1
Thine	1
own	1
begotten,	1
breaking	1
violent	1
way,	1
Tore	1
through	1
my	1
entrails,	1
that,	1
with	1
fear	1
and	1
pain	1
Distorted,	1
all	1
my	1
nether	1
shape	1
thus	1
grew	1
Transformed:	1
but	1
he	1
my	1
inbred	1
enemy	1
Forth	1
issued,	1
brandishing	1
his	1
fatal	1
dart,	1
Made	1
to	1
destroy.	1
I	1
fled,	1
and	1
cried	1
out	1
Death!	1
Hell	1
trembled	1
at	1
the	1
hideous	1
name,	1
and	1
sighed	1
From	1
all	1
her	1
caves,	1
and	1
back	1
resounded	1
Death!	1
I	1
fled;	1
but	1
he	1
pursued	1
(though	1
more,	1
it	1
seems,	1
Inflamed	1
with	1
lust	1
than	1
rage),	1
and,	1
swifter	1
far,	1
Me	1
overtook,	1
his	1
mother,	1
all	1
dismayed,	1
And,	1
in	1
embraces	1
forcible	1
and	1
foul	1
Engendering	1
with	1
me,	1
of	1
that	1
rape	1
begot	1
These	1
yelling	1
monsters,	1
that	1
with	1
ceaseless	1
cry	1
Surround	1
me,	1
as	1
thou	1
saw'st--hourly	1
conceived	1
And	1
hourly	1
born,	1
with	1
sorrow	1
infinite	1
To	1
me;	1
for,	1
when	1
they	1
list,	1
into	1
the	1
womb	1
That	1
bred	1
them	1
they	1
return,	1
and	1
howl,	1
and	1
gnaw	1
My	1
bowels,	1
their	1
repast;	1
then,	1
bursting	1
forth	1
Afresh,	1
with	1
conscious	1
terrors	1
vex	1
me	1
round,	1
That	1
rest	1
or	1
intermission	1
none	1
I	1
find.	1
Before	1
mine	1
eyes	1
in	1
opposition	1
sits	1
Grim	1
Death,	1
my	1
son	1
and	1
foe,	1
who	1
set	1
them	1
on,	1
And	1
me,	1
his	1
parent,	1
would	1
full	1
soon	1
devour	1
For	1
want	1
of	1
other	1
prey,	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
knows	1
His	1
end	1
with	1
mine	1
involved,	1
and	1
knows	1
that	1
I	1
Should	1
prove	1
a	1
bitter	1
morsel,	1
and	1
his	1
bane,	1
Whenever	1
that	1
shall	1
be:	1
so	1
Fate	1
pronounced.	1
But	1
thou,	1
O	1
father,	1
I	1
forewarn	1
thee,	1
shun	1
His	1
deadly	1
arrow;	1
neither	1
vainly	1
hope	1
To	1
be	1
invulnerable	1
in	1
those	1
bright	1
arms,	1
Through	1
tempered	1
heavenly;	1
for	1
that	1
mortal	1
dint,	1
Save	1
he	1
who	1
reigns	1
above,	1
none	1
can	1
resist."	1
She	1
finished;	1
and	1
the	1
subtle	1
Fiend	1
his	1
lore	1
Soon	1
learned,	1
now	1
milder,	1
and	1
thus	1
answered	1
smooth:--	1
"Dear	1
daughter--since	1
thou	1
claim'st	1
me	1
for	1
thy	1
sire,	1
And	1
my	1
fair	1
son	1
here	1
show'st	1
me,	1
the	1
dear	1
pledge	1
Of	1
dalliance	1
had	1
with	1
thee	1
in	1
Heaven,	1
and	1
joys	1
Then	1
sweet,	1
now	1
sad	1
to	1
mention,	1
through	1
dire	1
change	1
Befallen	1
us	1
unforeseen,	1
unthought-of--know,	1
I	1
come	1
no	1
enemy,	1
but	1
to	1
set	1
free	1
From	1
out	1
this	1
dark	1
and	1
dismal	1
house	1
of	1
pain	1
Both	1
him	1
and	1
thee,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
heavenly	1
host	1
Of	1
Spirits	1
that,	1
in	1
our	1
just	1
pretences	1
armed,	1
Fell	1
with	1
us	1
from	1
on	1
high.	1
From	1
them	1
I	1
go	1
This	1
uncouth	1
errand	1
sole,	1
and	1
one	1
for	1
all	1
Myself	1
expose,	1
with	1
lonely	1
steps	1
to	1
tread	1
Th'	1
unfounded	1
Deep,	1
and	1
through	1
the	1
void	1
immense	1
To	1
search,	1
with	1
wandering	1
quest,	1
a	1
place	1
foretold	1
Should	1
be--and,	1
by	1
concurring	1
signs,	1
ere	1
now	1
Created	1
vast	1
and	1
round--a	1
place	1
of	1
bliss	1
In	1
the	1
purlieus	1
of	1
Heaven;	1
and	1
therein	1
placed	1
A	1
race	1
of	1
upstart	1
creatures,	1
to	1
supply	1
Perhaps	1
our	1
vacant	1
room,	1
though	1
more	1
removed,	1
Lest	1
Heaven,	1
surcharged	1
with	1
potent	1
multitude,	1
Might	1
hap	1
to	1
move	1
new	1
broils.	1
Be	1
this,	1
or	1
aught	1
Than	1
this	1
more	1
secret,	1
now	1
designed,	1
I	1
haste	1
To	1
know;	1
and,	1
this	1
once	1
known,	1
shall	1
soon	1
return,	1
And	1
bring	1
ye	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
thou	1
and	1
Death	1
Shall	1
dwell	1
at	1
ease,	1
and	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
unseen	1
Wing	1
silently	1
the	1
buxom	1
air,	1
embalmed	1
With	1
odours.	1
There	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
fed	1
and	1
filled	1
Immeasurably;	1
all	1
things	1
shall	1
be	1
your	1
prey."	1
He	1
ceased;	1
for	1
both	1
seemed	1
highly	1
pleased,	1
and	1
Death	1
Grinned	1
horrible	1
a	1
ghastly	1
smile,	1
to	1
hear	1
His	1
famine	1
should	1
be	1
filled,	1
and	1
blessed	1
his	1
maw	1
Destined	1
to	1
that	1
good	1
hour.	1
No	1
less	1
rejoiced	1
His	1
mother	1
bad,	1
and	1
thus	1
bespake	1
her	1
sire:--	1
"The	1
key	1
of	1
this	1
infernal	1
Pit,	1
by	1
due	1
And	1
by	1
command	1
of	1
Heaven's	1
all-powerful	1
King,	1
I	1
keep,	1
by	1
him	1
forbidden	1
to	1

These	1
adamantine	1
gates;	1
against	1
all	1
force	1
Death	1
ready	1
stands	1
to	1
interpose	1
his	1
dart,	1
Fearless	1
to	1
be	1
o'ermatched	1
by	1
living	1
might.	1
But	1
what	1
owe	1
I	1
to	1
his	1
commands	1
above,	1
Who	1
hates	1
me,	1
and	1
hath	1
hither	1
thrust	1
me	1
down	1
Into	1
this	1
gloom	1
of	1
Tartarus	1
profound,	1
To	1
sit	1
in	1
hateful	1
office	1
here	1
confined,	1
Inhabitant	1
of	1
Heaven	1
and	1
heavenly	1
born--	1
Here	1
in	1
perpetual	1
agony	1
and	1
pain,	1
With	1
terrors	1
and	1
with	1
clamours	1
compassed	1
round	1
Of	1
mine	1
own	1
brood,	1
that	1
on	1
my	1
bowels	1
feed?	1
Thou	1
art	1
my	1
father,	1
thou	1
my	1
author,	1
thou	1
My	1
being	1
gav'st	1
me;	1
whom	1
should	1
I	1
obey	1
But	1
thee?	1
whom	1
follow?	1
Thou	1
wilt	1
bring	1
me	1
soon	1
To	1
that	1
new	1
world	1
of	1
light	1
and	1
bliss,	1
among	1
The	1
gods	1
who	1
live	1
at	1
ease,	1
where	1
I	1
shall	1
reign	1
At	1
thy	1
right	1
hand	1
voluptuous,	1
as	1
beseems	1
Thy	1
daughter	1
and	1
thy	1
darling,	1
without	1
end."	1
Thus	1
saying,	1
from	1
her	1
side	1
the	1
fatal	1
key,	1
Sad	1
instrument	1
of	1
all	1
our	1
woe,	1
she	1
took;	1
And,	1
towards	1
the	1
gate	1
rolling	1
her	1
bestial	1
train,	1
Forthwith	1
the	1
huge	1
portcullis	1
high	1
up-drew,	1
Which,	1
but	1
herself,	1
not	1
all	1
the	1
Stygian	1
Powers	1
Could	1
once	1
have	1
moved;	1
then	1
in	1
the	1
key-hole	1
turns	1
Th'	1
intricate	1
wards,	1
and	1
every	1
bolt	1
and	1
bar	1
Of	1
massy	1
iron	1
or	1
solid	1
rock	1
with	1
ease	1
Unfastens.	1
On	1
a	1
sudden	1
open	1
fly,	1
With	1
impetuous	1
recoil	1
and	1
jarring	1
sound,	1
Th'	1
infernal	1
doors,	1
and	1
on	1
their	1
hinges	1
grate	1
Harsh	1
thunder,	1
that	1
the	1
lowest	1
bottom	1
shook	1
Of	1
Erebus.	1
She	1
opened;	1
but	1
to	1
shut	1
Excelled	1
her	1
power:	1
the	1
gates	1
wide	1
open	1
stood,	1
That	1
with	1
extended	1
wings	1
a	1
bannered	1
host,	1
Under	1
spread	1
ensigns	1
marching,	1
mibht	1
pass	1
through	1
With	1
horse	1
and	1
chariots	1
ranked	1
in	1
loose	1
array;	1
So	1
wide	1
they	1
stood,	1
and	1
like	1
a	1
furnace-mouth	1
Cast	1
forth	1
redounding	1
smoke	1
and	1
ruddy	1
flame.	1
Before	1
their	1
eyes	1
in	1
sudden	1
view	1
appear	1
The	1
secrets	1
of	1
the	1
hoary	1
Deep--a	1
dark	1
Illimitable	1
ocean,	1
without	1
bound,	1
Without	1
dimension;	1
where	1
length,	1
breadth,	1
and	1
height,	1
And	1
time,	1
and	1
place,	1
are	1
lost;	1
where	1
eldest	1
Night	1
And	1
Chaos,	1
ancestors	1
of	1
Nature,	1
hold	1
Eternal	1
anarchy,	1
amidst	1
the	1
noise	1
Of	1
endless	1
wars,	1
and	1
by	1
confusion	1
stand.	1
For	1
Hot,	1
Cold,	1
Moist,	1
and	1
Dry,	1
four	1
champions	1
fierce,	1
Strive	1
here	1
for	1
mastery,	1
and	1
to	1
battle	1
bring	1
Their	1
embryon	1
atoms:	1
they	1
around	1
the	1
flag	1
Of	1
each	1
his	1
faction,	1
in	1
their	1
several	1
clans,	1
Light-armed	1
or	1
heavy,	1
sharp,	1
smooth,	1
swift,	1
or	1
slow,	1
Swarm	1
populous,	1
unnumbered	1
as	1
the	1
sands	1
Of	1
Barca	1
or	1
Cyrene's	1
torrid	1
soil,	1
Levied	1
to	1
side	1
with	1
warring	1
winds,	1
and	1
poise	1
Their	1
lighter	1
wings.	1
To	1
whom	1
these	1
most	1
adhere	1
He	1
rules	1
a	1
moment:	1
Chaos	1
umpire	1
sits,	1
And	1
by	1
decision	1
more	1
embroils	1
the	1
fray	1
By	1
which	1
he	1
reigns:	1
next	1
him,	1
high	1
arbiter,	1
Chance	1
governs	1
all.	1
Into	1
this	1
wild	1
Abyss,	1
The	1
womb	1
of	1
Nature,	1
and	1
perhaps	1
her	1
grave,	1
Of	1
neither	1
sea,	1
nor	1
shore,	1
nor	1
air,	1
nor	1
fire,	1
But	1
all	1
these	1
in	1
their	1
pregnant	1
causes	1
mixed	1
Confusedly,	1
and	1
which	1
thus	1
must	1
ever	1
fight,	1
Unless	1
th'	1
Almighty	1
Maker	1
them	1
ordain	1
His	1
dark	1
materials	1
to	1
create	1
more	1
worlds--	1
Into	1
this	1
wild	1
Abyss	1
the	1
wary	1
Fiend	1
Stood	1
on	1
the	1
brink	1
of	1
Hell	1
and	1
looked	1
a	1
while,	1
Pondering	1
his	1
voyage;	1
for	1
no	1
narrow	1
frith	1
He	1
had	1
to	1
cross.	1
Nor	1
was	1
his	1
ear	1
less	1
pealed	1
With	1
noises	1
loud	1
and	1
ruinous	1
(to	1
compare	1
Great	1
things	1
with	1
small)	1
than	1
when	1
Bellona	1
storms	1
With	1
all	1
her	1
battering	1
engines,	1
bent	1
to	1
rase	1
Some	1
capital	1
city;	1
or	1
less	1
than	1
if	1
this	1
frame	1
Of	1
Heaven	1
were	1
falling,	1
and	1
these	1
elements	1
In	1
mutiny	1
had	1
from	1
her	1
axle	1
torn	1
The	1
steadfast	1
Earth.	1
At	1
last	1
his	1
sail-broad	1
vans	1
He	1
spread	1
for	1
flight,	1
and,	1
in	1
the	1
surging	1
smoke	1
Uplifted,	1
spurns	1
the	1
ground;	1
thence	1
many	1
a	1
league,	1
As	1
in	1
a	1
cloudy	1
chair,	1
ascending	1
rides	1
Audacious;	1
but,	1
that	1
seat	1
soon	1
failing,	1
meets	1
A	1
vast	1
vacuity.	1
All	1
unawares,	1
Fluttering	1
his	1
pennons	1
vain,	1
plumb-down	1
he	1
drops	1
Ten	1
thousand	1
fathom	1
deep,	1
and	1
to	1
this	1
hour	1
Down	1
had	1
been	1
falling,	1
had	1
not,	1
by	1
ill	1
chance,	1
The	1
strong	1
rebuff	1
of	1
some	1
tumultuous	1
cloud,	1
Instinct	1
with	1
fire	1
and	1
nitre,	1
hurried	1
him	1
As	1
many	1
miles	1
aloft.	1
That	1
fury	1
stayed--	1
Quenched	1
in	1
a	1
boggy	1
Syrtis,	1
neither	1
sea,	1
Nor	1
good	1
dry	1
land--nigh	1
foundered,	1
on	1
he	1
fares,	1
Treading	1
the	1
crude	1
consistence,	1
half	1
on	1
foot,	1
Half	1
flying;	1
behoves	1
him	1
now	1
both	1
oar	1
and	1
sail.	1
As	1
when	1
a	1
gryphon	1
through	1
the	1
wilderness	1
With	1
winged	1
course,	1
o'er	1
hill	1
or	1
moory	1
dale,	1
Pursues	1
the	1
Arimaspian,	1
who	1
by	1
stealth	1
Had	1
from	1
his	1
wakeful	1
custody	1
purloined	1
The	1
guarded	1
gold;	1
so	1
eagerly	1
the	1
Fiend	1
O'er	1
bog	1
or	1
steep,	1
through	1
strait,	1
rough,	1
dense,	1
or	1
rare,	1
With	1
head,	1
hands,	1
wings,	1
or	1
feet,	1
pursues	1
his	1
way,	1
And	1
swims,	1
or	1
sinks,	1
or	1
wades,	1
or	1
creeps,	1
or	1
flies.	1
At	1
length	1
a	1
universal	1
hubbub	1
wild	1
Of	1
stunning	1
sounds,	1
and	1
voices	1
all	1
confused,	1
Borne	1
through	1
the	1
hollow	1
dark,	1
assaults	1
his	1
ear	1
With	1
loudest	1
vehemence.	1
Thither	1
he	1
plies	1
Undaunted,	1
to	1
meet	1
there	1
whatever	1
Power	1
Or	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
nethermost	1
Abyss	1
Might	1
in	1
that	1
noise	1
reside,	1
of	1
whom	1
to	1
ask	1
Which	1
way	1
the	1
nearest	1
coast	1
of	1
darkness	1
lies	1
Bordering	1
on	1
light;	1
when	1
straight	1
behold	1
the	1
throne	1
Of	1
Chaos,	1
and	1
his	1
dark	1
pavilion	1
spread	1
Wide	1
on	1
the	1
wasteful	1
Deep!	1
With	1
him	1
enthroned	1
Sat	1
sable-vested	1
Night,	1
eldest	1
of	1
things,	1
The	1
consort	1
of	1
his	1
reign;	1
and	1
by	1
them	1
stood	1
Orcus	1
and	1
Ades,	1
and	1
the	1
dreaded	1
name	1
Of	1
Demogorgon;	1
Rumour	1
next,	1
and	1
Chance,	1
And	1
Tumult,	1
and	1
Confusion,	1
all	1
embroiled,	1
And	1
Discord	1
with	1
a	1
thousand	1
various	1
mouths.	1
T'	1
whom	1
Satan,	1
turning	1
boldly,	1
thus:--"Ye	1
Powers	1
And	1
Spirtis	1
of	1
this	1
nethermost	1
Abyss,	1
Chaos	1
and	1
ancient	1
Night,	1
I	1
come	1
no	1
spy	1
With	1
purpose	1
to	1
explore	1
or	1
to	1
disturb	1
The	1
secrets	1
of	1
your	1
realm;	1
but,	1
by	1
constraint	1
Wandering	1
this	1
darksome	1
desert,	1
as	1
my	1
way	1
Lies	1
through	1
your	1
spacious	1
empire	1
up	1
to	1
light,	1
Alone	1
and	1
without	1
guide,	1
half	1
lost,	1
I	1
seek,	1
What	1
readiest	1
path	1
leads	1
where	1
your	1
gloomy	1
bounds	1
Confine	1
with	1
Heaven;	1
or,	1
if	1
some	1
other	1
place,	1
From	1
your	1
dominion	1
won,	1
th'	1
Ethereal	1
King	1
Possesses	1
lately,	1
thither	1
to	1
arrive	1
I	1
travel	1
this	1
profound.	1
Direct	1
my	1
course:	1
Directed,	1
no	1
mean	1
recompense	1
it	1
brings	1
To	1
your	1
behoof,	1
if	1
I	1
that	1
region	1
lost,	1
All	1
usurpation	1
thence	1
expelled,	1
reduce	1
To	1
her	1
original	1
darkness	1
and	1
your	1
sway	1
(Which	1
is	1
my	1
present	1
journey),	1
and	1
once	1
more	1
Erect	1
the	1
standard	1
there	1
of	1
ancient	1
Night.	1
Yours	1
be	1
th'	1
advantage	1
all,	1
mine	1
the	1
revenge!"	1
Thus	1
Satan;	1
and	1
him	1
thus	1
the	1
Anarch	1
old,	1
With	1
faltering	1
speech	1
and	1
visage	1
incomposed,	1
Answered:	1
"I	1
know	1
thee,	1
stranger,	1
who	1
thou	1
art--	1
***	1
That	1
mighty	1
leading	1
Angel,	1
who	1
of	1
late	1
Made	1
head	1
against	1
Heaven's	1
King,	1
though	1
overthrown.	1
I	1
saw	1
and	1
heard;	1
for	1
such	1
a	1
numerous	1
host	1
Fled	1
not	1
in	1
silence	1
through	1
the	1
frighted	1
Deep,	1
With	1
ruin	1
upon	1
ruin,	1
rout	1
on	1
rout,	1
Confusion	1
worse	1
confounded;	1
and	1
Heaven-gates	1
Poured	1
out	1
by	1
millions	1
her	1
victorious	1
bands,	1
Pursuing.	1
I	1
upon	1
my	1
frontiers	1
here	1
Keep	1
residence;	1
if	1
all	1
I	1
can	1
will	1
serve	1
That	1
little	1
which	1
is	1
left	1
so	1
to	1
defend,	1
Encroached	1
on	1
still	1
through	1
our	1
intestine	1
broils	1
Weakening	1
the	1
sceptre	1
of	1
old	1
Night:	1
first,	1
Hell,	1
Your	1
dungeon,	1
stretching	1
far	1
and	1
wide	1
beneath;	1
Now	1
lately	1
Heaven	1
and	1
Earth,	1
another	1
world	1
Hung	1
o'er	1
my	1
realm,	1
linked	1
in	1
a	1
golden	1
chain	1
To	1
that	1
side	1
Heaven	1
from	1
whence	1
your	1
legions	1
fell!	1
If	1
that	1
way	1
be	1
your	1
walk,	1
you	1
have	1
not	1
far;	1
So	1
much	1
the	1
nearer	1
danger.	1
Go,	1
and	1
speed;	1
Havoc,	1
and	1
spoil,	1
and	1
ruin,	1
are	1
my	1
gain."	1
He	1
ceased;	1
and	1
Satan	1
stayed	1
not	1
to	1
reply,	1
But,	1
glad	1
that	1
now	1
his	1
sea	1
should	1
find	1
a	1
shore,	1
With	1
fresh	1
alacrity	1
and	1
force	1
renewed	1
Springs	1
upward,	1
like	1
a	1
pyramid	1
of	1
fire,	1
Into	1
the	1
wild	1
expanse,	1
and	1
through	1
the	1
shock	1
Of	1
fighting	1
elements,	1
on	1
all	1
sides	1
round	1
Environed,	1
wins	1
his	1
way;	1
harder	1
beset	1
And	1
more	1
endangered	1
than	1
when	1
Argo	1
passed	1
Through	1
Bosporus	1
betwixt	1
the	1
justling	1
rocks,	1
Or	1
when	1
Ulysses	1
on	1
the	1
larboard	1
shunned	1
Charybdis,	1
and	1
by	1
th'	1
other	1
whirlpool	1
steered.	1
So	1
he	1
with	1
difficulty	1
and	1
labour	1
hard	1
Moved	1
on,	1
with	1
difficulty	1
and	1
labour	1
he;	1
But,	1
he	1
once	1
passed,	1
soon	1
after,	1
when	1
Man	1
fell,	1
Strange	1
alteration!	1
Sin	1
and	1
Death	1
amain,	1
Following	1
his	1
track	1
(such	1
was	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
Heaven)	1
Paved	1
after	1
him	1
a	1
broad	1
and	1
beaten	1
way	1
Over	1
the	1
dark	1
Abyss,	1
whose	1
boiling	1
gulf	1
Tamely	1
endured	1
a	1
bridge	1
of	1
wondrous	1
length,	1
From	1
Hell	1
continued,	1
reaching	1
th'	1
utmost	1
orb	1
Of	1
this	1
frail	1
World;	1
by	1
which	1
the	1
Spirits	1
perverse	1
With	1
easy	1
intercourse	1
pass	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
To	1
tempt	1
or	1
punish	1
mortals,	1
except	1
whom	1
God	1
and	1
good	1
Angels	1
guard	1
by	1
special	1
grace.	1
But	1
now	1
at	1
last	1
the	1
sacred	1
influence	1
Of	1
light	1
appears,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
Heaven	1
Shoots	1
far	1
into	1
the	1
bosom	1
of	1
dim	1
Night	1
A	1
glimmering	1
dawn.	1
Here	1
Nature	1
first	1
begins	1
Her	1
farthest	1
verge,	1
and	1
Chaos	1
to	1
retire,	1
As	1
from	1
her	1
outmost	1
works,	1
a	1
broken	1
foe,	1
With	1
tumult	1
less	1
and	1
with	1
less	1
hostile	1
din;	1
That	1
Satan	1
with	1
less	1
toil,	1
and	1
now	1
with	1
ease,	1
Wafts	1
on	1
the	1
calmer	1
wave	1
by	1
dubious	1
light,	1
And,	1
like	1
a	1
weather-beaten	1
vessel,	1
holds	1
Gladly	1
the	1
port,	1
though	1
shrouds	1
and	1
tackle	1
torn;	1
Or	1
in	1
the	1
emptier	1
waste,	1
resembling	1
air,	1
Weighs	1
his	1
spread	1
wings,	1
at	1
leisure	1
to	1
behold	1
Far	1
off	1
th'	1
empyreal	1
Heaven,	1
extended	1
wide	1
In	1
circuit,	1
undetermined	1
square	1

round,	1
With	1
opal	1

adorned	1
Of	1
living	1

once	1
his	1

And,	1
fast	1
by,	1
hanging	1
in	1
a	1
golden	1
chain,	1
This	1
pendent	1
World,	1
in	1
bigness	1
as	1
a	1
star	1
Of	1

close	1

Thither,	1
full	1
fraught	1

Accursed,	1

Dwelt	1
from	1

dwelt	1
then	1
in	1
thee	1
Bright	1
effluence	1
of	1
bright	1
essence	1
increate.	1
Or	1
hear"st	1
thou	1
rather	1
pure	1
ethereal	1
stream,	1
Whose	1
fountain	1
who	1
shall	1
tell?	1
before	1
the	1
sun,	1
Before	1
the	1
Heavens	1
thou	1
wert,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
voice	1
Of	1
God,	1
as	1
with	1
a	1
mantle,	1
didst	1
invest	1
***	1
The	1
rising	1
world	1
of	1
waters	1
dark	1
and	1
deep,	1
Won	1
from	1
the	1
void	1
and	1
formless	1
infinite.	1
Thee	1
I	1
re-visit	1
now	1
with	1
bolder	1
wing,	1
Escap'd	1
the	1
Stygian	1
pool,	1
though	1
long	1
detain'd	1
In	1
that	1
obscure	1
sojourn,	1
while	1
in	1
my	1
flight	1
Through	1
utter	1
and	1
through	1
middle	1
darkness	1
borne,	1
With	1
other	1
notes	1
than	1
to	1
the	1
Orphean	1
lyre	1
I	1
sung	1
of	1
Chaos	1
and	1
eternal	1
Night;	1
Taught	1
by	1
the	1
heavenly	1
Muse	1
to	1
venture	1
down	1
The	1
dark	1
descent,	1
and	1
up	1
to	1
re-ascend,	1
Though	1
hard	1
and	1
rare:	1
Thee	1
I	1
revisit	1
safe,	1
And	1
feel	1
thy	1
sovran	1
vital	1
lamp;	1
but	1
thou	1
Revisit'st	1
not	1
these	1
eyes,	1
that	1
roll	1
in	1
vain	1
To	1
find	1
thy	1
piercing	1
ray,	1
and	1
find	1
no	1
dawn;	1
So	1
thick	1
a	1
drop	1
serene	1
hath	1
quench'd	1
their	1
orbs,	1
Or	1
dim	1
suffusion	1
veil'd.	1
Yet	1
not	1
the	1
more	1
Cease	1
I	1
to	1
wander,	1
where	1
the	1
Muses	1
haunt,	1
Clear	1
spring,	1
or	1
shady	1
grove,	1
or	1
sunny	1
hill,	1
Smit	1
with	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
sacred	1
song;	1
but	1
chief	1
Thee,	1
Sion,	1
and	1
the	1
flowery	1
brooks	1
beneath,	1
That	1
wash	1
thy	1
hallow'd	1
feet,	1
and	1
warbling	1
flow,	1
Nightly	1
I	1
visit:	1
nor	1
sometimes	1
forget	1
So	1
were	1
I	1
equall'd	1
with	1
them	1
in	1
renown,	1
Thy	1
sovran	1
command,	1
that	1
Man	1
should	1
find	1
grace;	1
Blind	1
Thamyris,	1
and	1
blind	1
Maeonides,	1
And	1
Tiresias,	1
and	1
Phineus,	1
prophets	1
old:	1
Then	1
feed	1
on	1
thoughts,	1
that	1
voluntary	1
move	1
Harmonious	1
numbers;	1
as	1
the	1
wakeful	1
bird	1
Sings	1
darkling,	1
and	1
in	1
shadiest	1
covert	1
hid	1
Tunes	1
her	1
nocturnal	1
note.	1
Thus	1
with	1
the	1
year	1
Seasons	1
return;	1
but	1
not	1
to	1
me	1
returns	1
Day,	1
or	1
the	1
sweet	1
approach	1
of	1
even	1
or	1
morn,	1
Or	1
sight	1
of	1
vernal	1
bloom,	1
or	1
summer's	1
rose,	1
Or	1
flocks,	1
or	1
herds,	1
or	1
human	1
face	1
divine;	1
But	1
cloud	1
instead,	1
and	1
ever-during	1
dark	1
Surrounds	1
me,	1
from	1
the	1
cheerful	1
ways	1
of	1
men	1
Cut	1
off,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
knowledge	1
fair	1
Presented	1
with	1
a	1
universal	1
blank	1
Of	1
nature's	1
works	1
to	1
me	1
expung'd	1
and	1
ras'd,	1
And	1
wisdom	1
at	1
one	1
entrance	1
quite	1
shut	1
out.	1
So	1
much	1
the	1
rather	1
thou,	1
celestial	1
Light,	1
Shine	1
inward,	1
and	1
the	1
mind	1
through	1
all	1
her	1
powers	1
Irradiate;	1
there	1
plant	1
eyes,	1
all	1
mist	1
from	1
thence	1
Purge	1
and	1
disperse,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
see	1
and	1
tell	1
Of	1
things	1
invisible	1
to	1
mortal	1
sight.	1
Now	1
had	1
the	1
Almighty	1
Father	1
from	1
above,	1
From	1
the	1
pure	1
empyrean	1
where	1
he	1
sits	1
High	1
thron'd	1
above	1
all	1
highth,	1
bent	1
down	1
his	1
eye	1
His	1
own	1
works	1
and	1
their	1
works	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
view:	1
About	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
Sanctities	1
of	1
Heaven	1
Stood	1
thick	1
as	1
stars,	1
and	1
from	1
his	1
sight	1
receiv'd	1
Beatitude	1
past	1
utterance;	1
on	1
his	1
right	1
The	1
radiant	1
image	1
of	1
his	1
glory	1
sat,	1
His	1
only	1
son;	1
on	1
earth	1
he	1
first	1
beheld	1
Our	1
two	1
first	1
parents,	1
yet	1
the	1
only	1
two	1
Of	1
mankind	1
in	1
the	1
happy	1
garden	1
plac'd	1
Reaping	1
immortal	1
fruits	1
of	1
joy	1
and	1
love,	1
Uninterrupted	1
joy,	1
unrivall'd	1
love,	1
In	1
blissful	1
solitude;	1
he	1
then	1
survey'd	1
Hell	1
and	1
the	1
gulf	1
between,	1
and	1
Satan	1
there	1
Coasting	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
Heaven	1
on	1
this	1
side	1
Night	1
In	1
the	1
dun	1
air	1
sublime,	1
and	1
ready	1
now	1
To	1
stoop	1
with	1
wearied	1
wings,	1
and	1
willing	1
feet,	1
On	1
the	1
bare	1
outside	1
of	1
this	1
world,	1
that	1
seem'd	1
Firm	1
land	1
imbosom'd,	1
without	1
firmament,	1
Uncertain	1
which,	1
in	1
ocean	1
or	1
in	1
air.	1
Him	1
God	1
beholding	1
from	1
his	1
prospect	1
high,	1
Wherein	1
past,	1
present,	1
future,	1
he	1
beholds,	1
Thus	1
to	1
his	1
only	1
Son	1
foreseeing	1
spake.	1
Only	1
begotten	1
Son,	1
seest	1
thou	1
what	1
rage	1
Transports	1
our	1
Adversary?	1
whom	1
no	1
bounds	1
Prescrib'd	1
no	1
bars	1
of	1
Hell,	1
nor	1
all	1
the	1
chains	1
Heap'd	1
on	1
him	1
there,	1
nor	1
yet	1
the	1
main	1
abyss	1
Wide	1
interrupt,	1
can	1
hold;	1
so	1
bent	1
he	1
seems	1
On	1
desperate	1
revenge,	1
that	1
shall	1
redound	1
Upon	1
his	1
own	1
rebellious	1
head.	1
And	1
now,	1
Through	1
all	1
restraint	1
broke	1
loose,	1
he	1
wings	1
his	1
way	1
Not	1
far	1
off	1
Heaven,	1
in	1
the	1
precincts	1
of	1
light,	1
Directly	1
towards	1
the	1
new	1
created	1
world,	1
And	1
man	1
there	1
plac'd,	1
with	1
purpose	1
to	1
assay	1
If	1
him	1
by	1
force	1
he	1
can	1
destroy,	1
or,	1
worse,	1
By	1
some	1
false	1
guile	1
pervert;	1
and	1
shall	1
pervert;	1
For	1
man	1
will	1
hearken	1
to	1
his	1
glozing	1
lies,	1
And	1
easily	1
transgress	1
the	1
sole	1
command,	1
Sole	1
pledge	1
of	1
his	1
obedience:	1
So	1
will	1
fall	1
He	1
and	1
his	1
faithless	1
progeny:	1
Whose	1
fault?	1
Whose	1
but	1
his	1
own?	1
ingrate,	1
he	1
had	1
of	1
me	1
All	1
he	1
could	1
have;	1
I	1
made	1
him	1
just	1
and	1
right,	1
Sufficient	1
to	1
have	1
stood,	1
though	1
free	1
to	1
fall.	1
Such	1
I	1
created	1
all	1
the	1
ethereal	1
Powers	1
And	1
Spirits,	1
both	1
them	1
who	1
stood,	1
and	1
them	1
who	1
fail'd;	1
Freely	1
they	1
stood	1
who	1
stood,	1
and	1
fell	1
who	1
fell.	1
Not	1
free,	1
what	1
proof	1
could	1
they	1
have	1
given	1
sincere	1
Of	1
true	1
allegiance,	1
constant	1
faith	1
or	1
love,	1
Where	1
only	1
what	1
they	1
needs	1
must	1
do	1
appear'd,	1
Not	1
what	1
they	1
would?	1
what	1
praise	1
could	1
they	1
receive?	1
What	1
pleasure	1
I	1
from	1
such	1
obedience	1
paid,	1
When	1
will	1
and	1
reason	1
(reason	1
also	1
is	1
choice)	1
Useless	1
and	1
vain,	1
of	1
freedom	1
both	1
despoil'd,	1
Made	1
passive	1
both,	1
had	1
serv'd	1
necessity,	1
Not	1
me?	1
they	1
therefore,	1
as	1
to	1
right	1
belong$	1
'd,	1
So	1
were	1
created,	1
nor	1
can	1
justly	1
accuse	1
Their	1
Maker,	1
or	1
their	1
making,	1
or	1
their	1
fate,	1
As	1
if	1
predestination	1
over-rul'd	1
Their	1
will	1
dispos'd	1
by	1
absolute	1
decree	1
Or	1
high	1
foreknowledge	1
they	1
themselves	1
decreed	1
Their	1
own	1
revolt,	1
not	1
I;	1
if	1
I	1
foreknew,	1
Foreknowledge	1
had	1
no	1
influence	1
on	1
their	1
fault,	1
Which	1
had	1
no	1
less	1
proved	1
certain	1
unforeknown.	1
So	1
without	1
least	1
impulse	1
or	1
shadow	1
of	1
fate,	1
Or	1
aught	1
by	1
me	1
immutably	1
foreseen,	1
They	1
trespass,	1
authors	1
to	1
themselves	1
in	1
all	1
Both	1
what	1
they	1
judge,	1
and	1
what	1
they	1
choose;	1
for	1
so	1
I	1
form'd	1
them	1
free:	1
and	1
free	1
they	1
must	1
remain,	1
Till	1
they	1
enthrall	1
themselves;	1
I	1
else	1
must	1
change	1
Their	1
nature,	1
and	1
revoke	1
the	1
high	1
decree	1
Unchangeable,	1
eternal,	1
which	1
ordain'd	1
$THeir	1
freedom:	1
they	1
themselves	1
ordain'd	1
their	1
fall.	1
The	1
first	1
sort	1
by	1
their	1
own	1
suggestion	1
fell,	1
Self-tempted,	1
self-deprav'd:	1
Man	1
falls,	1
deceiv'd	1
By	1
the	1
other	1
first:	1
Man	1
therefore	1
shall	1
find	1
grace,	1
The	1
other	1
none:	1
In	1
mercy	1
and	1
justice	1
both,	1
Through	1
Heaven	1
and	1
Earth,	1
so	1
shall	1
my	1
glory	1
excel;	1
But	1
Mercy,	1
first	1
and	1
last,	1
shall	1
brightest	1
shine.	1
Thus	1
while	1
God	1
spake,	1
ambrosial	1
fragrance	1
fill'd	1
All	1
Heaven,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
blessed	1
Spirits	1
elect	1
Sense	1
of	1
new	1
joy	1
ineffable	1
diffus'd.	1
Beyond	1
compare	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
was	1
seen	1
Most	1
glorious;	1
in	1
him	1
all	1
his	1
Father	1
shone	1
Substantially	1
express'd;	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
face	1
Divine	1
compassion	1
visibly	1
appear'd,	1
Love	1
without	1
end,	1
and	1
without	1
measure	1
grace,	1
Which	1
uttering,	1
thus	1
he	1
to	1
his	1
Father	1
spake.	1
O	1
Father,	1
gracious	1
was	1
that	1
word	1
which	1
clos'd	1
Thy	1
sovran	1
command,	1
that	1
Man	1
should	1
find	1
grace;	1
,	1
that	1
Man	1
should	1
find	1
grace;	1
For	1
which	1
both	1
Heaven	1
and	1
earth	1
shall	1
high	1
extol	1
Thy	1
praises,	1
with	1
the	1
innumerable	1
sound	1
Of	1
hymns	1
and	1
sacred	1
songs,	1
wherewith	1
thy	1
throne	1
Encompass'd	1
shall	1
resound	1
thee	1
ever	1
blest.	1
For	1
should	1
Man	1
finally	1
be	1
lost,	1
should	1
Man,	1
Thy	1
creature	1
late	1
so	1
lov'd,	1
thy	1
youngest	1
son,	1
Fall	1
circumvented	1
thus	1
by	1
fraud,	1
though	1
join'd	1
With	1
his	1
own	1
folly?	1
that	1
be	1
from	1
thee	1
far,	1
That	1
far	1
be	1
from	1
thee,	1
Father,	1
who	1
art	1
judge	1
Of	1
all	1
things	1
made,	1
and	1
judgest	1
only	1
right.	1
Or	1
shall	1
the	1
Adversary	1
thus	1
obtain	1
His	1
end,	1
and	1
frustrate	1
thine?	1
shall	1
he	1
fulfill	1
His	1
malice,	1
and	1
thy	1
goodness	1
bring	1
to	1
nought,	1
Or	1
proud	1
return,	1
though	1
to	1
his	1
heavier	1
doom,	1
Yet	1
with	1
revenge	1
accomplish'd,	1
and	1
to	1
Hell	1
Draw	1
after	1
him	1
the	1
whole	1
race	1
of	1
mankind,	1
By	1
him	1
corrupted?	1
or	1
wilt	1
thou	1
thyself	1
Abolish	1
thy	1
creation,	1
and	1
unmake	1
For	1
him,	1
what	1
for	1
thy	1
glory	1
thou	1
hast	1
made?	1
So	1
should	1
thy	1
goodness	1
and	1
thy	1
greatness	1
both	1
Be	1
question'd	1
and	1
blasphem'd	1
without	1
defence.	1
To	1
whom	1
the	1
great	1
Creator	1
thus	1
replied.	1
O	1
son,	1
in	1
whom	1
my	1
soul	1
hath	1
chief	1
delight,	1
Son	1
of	1
my	1
bosom,	1
Son	1
who	1
art	1
alone.	1
My	1
word,	1
my	1
wisdom,	1
and	1
effectual	1
might,	1
All	1
hast	1
thou	1
spoken	1
as	1
my	1
thoughts	1
are,	1
all	1
As	1
my	1
eternal	1
purpose	1
hath	1
decreed;	1
Man	1
shall	1
not	1
quite	1
be	1
lost,	1
but	1
sav'd	1
who	1
will;	1
Yet	1
not	1
of	1
will	1
in	1
him,	1
but	1
grace	1
in	1
me	1
Freely	1
vouchsaf'd;	1
once	1
more	1
I	1
will	1
renew	1
His	1
lapsed	1
powers,	1
though	1
forfeit;	1
and	1
enthrall'd	1
By	1
sin	1
to	1
foul	1
exorbitant	1
desires;	1
Upheld	1
by	1
me,	1
yet	1
once	1
more	1
he	1
shall	1
stand	1
On	1
even	1
ground	1
against	1
his	1
mortal	1
foe;	1
By	1
me	1
upheld,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
know	1
how	1
frail	1
His	1
fallen	1
condition	1
is,	1
and	1
to	1
me	1
owe	1
All	1
his	1
deliverance,	1
and	1
to	1
none	1
but	1
me.	1
Some	1
I	1
have	1
chosen	1
of	1
peculiar	1
grace,	1
Elect	1
above	1
the	1
rest;	1
so	1
is	1
my	1
will:	1
The	1
rest	1
shall	1
hear	1
me	1
call,	1
and	1
oft	1
be	1
warn'd	1
Their	1
sinful	1
state,	1
and	1
to	1
appease	1
betimes	1
The	1
incensed	1
Deity,	1
while	1
offer'd	1
grace	1
Invites;	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
clear	1
their	1
senses	1
dark,	1
What	1
may	1
suffice,	1
and	1
soften	1
stony	1
hearts	1
To	1
pray,	1
repent,	1
and	1
bring	1
obedience	1
due.	1
To	1
prayer,	1
repentance,	1
and	1
obedience	1
due,	1
Though	1
but	1
endeavour'd	1
with	1
sincere	1
intent,	1
Mine	1
ear	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
slow,	1
mine	1
eye	1
not	1
shut.	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
place	1
within	1
them	1
as	1
a	1
guide,	1
My	1
umpire	1
Conscience;	1
whom	1
if	1
they	1
will	1
hear,	1
Light	1
after	1
light,	1
well	1
us'd,	1
they	1
shall	1
attain,	1
And	1
to	1
the	1
end,	1
persisting,	1
safe	1
arrive.	1
This	1
my	1
long	1
sufferance,	1
and	1
my	1
day	1
of	1
grace,	1
They	1
who	1
neglect	1
and	1
scorn,	1
shall	1
never	1
taste;	1
But	1
hard	1
be	1
harden'd,	1
blind	1
be	1
blinded	1
more,	1
That	1
they	1
may	1
stumble	1
on,	1
and	1
deeper	1
fall;	1
And	1
none	1
but	1
such	1
from	1
mercy	1
I	1
exclude.	1
But	1
yet	1
all	1
is	1
not	1
done;	1
Man	1
disobeying,	1
Disloyal,	1
breaks	1
his	1
fealty,	1
and	1
sins	1
Against	1
the	1
high	1
supremacy	1
of	1
Heaven,	1
Affecting	1
God-head,	1
and,	1
so	1
losing	1
all,	1
To	1
expiate	1
his	1
treason	1
hath	1
nought	1
left,	1
But	1
to	1
destruction	1
sacred	1
and	1
devote,	1
He,	1
with	1
his	1
whole	1
posterity,	1
must	1
die,	1
Die	1
he	1
or	1
justice	1
must;	1
unless	1
for	1
him	1
Some	1
other	1
able,	1
and	1
as	1
willing,	1
pay	1
The	1
rigid	1
satisfaction,	1
death	1
for	1
death.	1
Say,	1
heavenly	1
Powers,	1
where	1
shall	1
we	1
find	1
such	1
love?	1
Which	1
of	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
mortal,	1
to	1
redeem	1
Man's	1
mortal	1
crime,	1
and	1
just	1
the	1
unjust	1
to	1
save?	1
Dwells	1
in	1
all	1
Heaven	1
charity	1
so	1
dear?	1
And	1
silence	1
was	1
in	1
Heaven:	1
$	1
on	1
Man's	1
behalf	1
He	1
ask'd,	1
but	1
all	1
the	1
heavenly	1
quire	1
stood	1
mute,	1
Patron	1
or	1
intercessour	1
none	1
appear'd,	1
Much	1
less	1
that	1
durst	1
upon	1
his	1
own	1
head	1
draw	1
The	1
deadly	1
forfeiture,	1
and	1
ransom	1
set.	1
And	1
now	1
without	1
redemption	1
all	1
mankind	1
Must	1
have	1
been	1
lost,	1
adjudg'd	1
to	1
Death	1
and	1
Hell	1
By	1
doom	1
severe,	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God,	1
In	1
whom	1
the	1
fulness	1
dwells	1
of	1
love	1
divine,	1
His	1
dearest	1
mediation	1
thus	1
renew'd.	1
Father,	1
thy	1
word	1
is	1
past,	1
Man	1
shall	1
find	1
grace;	1
And	1
shall	1
grace	1
not	1
find	1
means,	1
that	1
finds	1
her	1
way,	1
The	1
speediest	1
of	1
thy	1
winged	1
messengers,	1
To	1
visit	1
all	1
thy	1
creatures,	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
Comes	1
unprevented,	1
unimplor'd,	1
unsought?	1
Happy	1
for	1
Man,	1
so	1
coming;	1
he	1
her	1
aid	1
Can	1
never	1
seek,	1
once	1
dead	1
in	1
sins,	1
and	1
lost;	1
Atonement	1
for	1
himself,	1
or	1
offering	1
meet,	1
Indebted	1
and	1
undone,	1
hath	1
none	1
to	1
bring;	1
Behold	1
me	1
then:	1
me	1
for	1
him,	1
life	1
for	1
life	1
I	1
offer:	1
on	1
me	1
let	1
thine	1
anger	1
fall;	1
Account	1
me	1
Man;	1
I	1
for	1
his	1
sake	1
will	1
leave	1
Thy	1
bosom,	1
and	1
this	1
glory	1
next	1
to	1
thee	1
Freely	1
put	1
off,	1
and	1
for	1
him	1
lastly	1
die	1
Well	1
pleased;	1
on	1
me	1
let	1
Death	1
wreak	1
all	1
his	1
rage.	1
Under	1
his	1
gloomy	1
power	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
long	1
Lie	1
vanquished.	1
Thou	1
hast	1
given	1
me	1
to	1
possess	1
Life	1
in	1
myself	1
for	1
ever;	1
by	1
thee	1
I	1
live;	1
Though	1
now	1
to	1
Death	1
I	1
yield,	1
and	1
am	1
his	1
due,	1
All	1
that	1
of	1
me	1
can	1
die,	1
yet,	1
that	1
debt	1
paid,	1
$	1
thou	1
wilt	1
not	1
leave	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
loathsome	1
grave	1
His	1
prey,	1
nor	1
suffer	1
my	1
unspotted	1
soul	1
For	1
ever	1
with	1
corruption	1
there	1
to	1
dwell;	1
But	1
I	1
shall	1
rise	1
victorious,	1
and	1
subdue	1
My	1
vanquisher,	1
spoiled	1
of	1
his	1
vaunted	1
spoil.	1
Death	1
his	1
death's	1
wound	1
shall	1
then	1
receive,	1
and	1
stoop	1
Inglorious,	1
of	1
his	1
mortal	1
sting	1
disarmed;	1
I	1
through	1
the	1
ample	1
air	1
in	1
triumph	1
high	1
Shall	1
lead	1
Hell	1
captive	1
maugre	1
Hell,	1
and	1
show	1
The	1
powers	1
of	1
darkness	1
bound.	1
Thou,	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
Pleased,	1
out	1
of	1
Heaven	1
shalt	1
look	1
down	1
and	1
smile,	1
While,	1
by	1
thee	1
raised,	1
I	1
ruin	1
all	1
my	1
foes;	1
Death	1
last,	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
carcase	1
glut	1
the	1
grave;	1
Then,	1
with	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
my	1
redeemed,	1
Shall	1
enter	1
Heaven,	1
long	1
absent,	1
and	1
return,	1
Father,	1
to	1
see	1
thy	1
face,	1
wherein	1
no	1
cloud	1
Of	1
anger	1
shall	1
remain,	1
but	1
peace	1
assured	1
And	1
reconcilement:	1
wrath	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
more	1
Thenceforth,	1
but	1
in	1
thy	1
presence	1
joy	1
entire.	1
His	1
words	1
here	1
ended;	1
but	1
his	1
meek	1
aspect	1
Silent	1
yet	1
spake,	1
and	1
breathed	1
immortal	1
love	1
To	1
mortal	1
men,	1
above	1
which	1
only	1
shone	1
Filial	1
obedience:	1
as	1
a	1
sacrifice	1
Glad	1
to	1
be	1
offered,	1
he	1
attends	1
the	1
will	1
Of	1
his	1
great	1
Father.	1
Admiration	1
seized	1
All	1
Heaven,	1
what	1
this	1
might	1
mean,	1
and	1
whither	1
tend,	1
Wondering;	1
but	1
soon	1
th'	1
Almighty	1
thus	1
replied.	1
O	1
thou	1
in	1
Heaven	1
and	1
Earth	1
the	1
only	1
peace	1
Found	1
out	1
for	1
mankind	1
under	1
wrath,	1
O	1
thou	1
My	1
sole	1
complacence!	1
Well	1
thou	1
know'st	1
how	1
dear	1
To	1
me	1
are	1
all	1
my	1
works;	1
nor	1
Man	1
the	1
least,	1
Though	1
last	1
created,	1
that	1
for	1
him	1
I	1
spare	1
Thee	1
from	1
my	1
bosom	1
and	1
right	1
hand,	1
to	1
save,	1
By	1
losing	1
thee	1
a	1
while,	1
the	1
whole	1
race	1
lost.	1
00021053	1
Thou,	1
therefore,	1
whom	1
thou	1
only	1
canst	1
redeem,	1
Their	1
nature	1
also	1
to	1
thy	1
nature	1
join;	1
And	1
be	1
thyself	1
Man	1
among	1
men	1
on	1
Earth,	1
Made	1
flesh,	1
when	1
time	1
shall	1
be,	1
of	1
virgin	1
seed,	1
By	1
wondrous	1
birth;	1
be	1
thou	1
in	1
Adam's	1
room	1
The	1
head	1
of	1
all	1
mankind,	1
though	1
Adam's	1
son.	1
As	1
in	1
him	1
perish	1
all	1
men,	1
so	1
in	1
thee,	1
As	1
from	1
a	1
second	1
root,	1
shall	1
be	1
restored	1
As	1
many	1
as	1
are	1
restored,	1
without	1
thee	1
none.	1
His	1
crime	1
makes	1
guilty	1
all	1
his	1
sons;	1
thy	1
merit,	1
Imputed,	1
shall	1
absolve	1
them	1
who	1
renounce	1
Their	1
own	1
both	1
righteous	1
and	1
unrighteous	1
deeds,	1
And	1
live	1
in	1
thee	1
transplanted,	1
and	1
from	1
thee	1
Receive	1
new	1
life.	1
So	1
Man,	1
as	1
is	1
most	1
just,	1
Shall	1
satisfy	1
for	1
Man,	1
be	1
judged	1
and	1
die,	1
And	1
dying	1
rise,	1
and	1
rising	1
with	1
him	1
raise	1
His	1
brethren,	1
ransomed	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
dear	1
life.	1
So	1
heavenly	1
love	1
shall	1
outdo	1
hellish	1
hate,	1
Giving	1
to	1
death,	1
and	1
dying	1
to	1
redeem,	1
So	1
dearly	1
to	1
redeem	1
what	1
hellish	1
hate	1
So	1
easily	1
destroyed,	1
and	1
still	1
destroys	1
In	1
those	1
who,	1
when	1
they	1
may,	1
accept	1
not	1
grace.	1
Nor	1
shalt	1
thou,	1
by	1
descending	1
to	1
assume	1
Man's	1
nature,	1
lessen	1
or	1
degrade	1
thine	1
own.	1
Because	1
thou	1
hast,	1
though	1
throned	1
in	1
highest	1
bliss	1
Equal	1
to	1
God,	1
and	1
equally	1
enjoying	1
God-like	1
fruition,	1
quitted	1
all,	1
to	1
save	1
A	1
world	1
from	1
utter	1
loss,	1
and	1
hast	1
been	1
found	1
By	1
merit	1
more	1
than	1
birthright	1
Son	1
of	1
God,	1
Found	1
worthiest	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
by	1
being	1
good,	1
Far	1
more	1
than	1
great	1
or	1
high;	1
because	1
in	1
thee	1
Love	1
hath	1
abounded	1
more	1
than	1
glory	1
abounds;	1
Therefore	1
thy	1
humiliation	1
shall	1
exalt	1
With	1
thee	1
thy	1
manhood	1
also	1
to	1
this	1
throne:	1
Here	1
shalt	1
thou	1
sit	1
incarnate,	1
here	1
shalt	1
reign	1
Both	1
God	1
and	1
Man,	1
Son	1
both	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
Man,	1
Anointed	1
universal	1
King;	1
all	1
power	1
I	1
give	1
thee;	1
reign	1
for	1
ever,	1
and	1
assume	1
Thy	1
merits;	1
under	1
thee,	1
as	1
head	1
supreme,	1
Thrones,	1
Princedoms,	1
Powers,	1
Dominions,	1
I	1
reduce:	1
All	1
knees	1
to	1
thee	1
shall	1
bow,	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
bide	1
In	1
Heaven,	1
or	1
Earth,	1
or	1
under	1
Earth	1
in	1
Hell.	1
When	1
thou,	1
attended	1
gloriously	1
from	1
Heaven,	1
Shalt	1
in	1
the	1
sky	1
appear,	1
and	1
from	1
thee	1
send	1
The	1
summoning	1
Arch-Angels	1
to	1
proclaim	1
Thy	1
dread	1
tribunal;	1
forthwith	1
from	1
all	1
winds,	1
The	1
living,	1
and	1
forthwith	1
the	1
cited	1
dead	1
Of	1
all	1
past	1
ages,	1
to	1
the	1
general	1
doom	1
Shall	1
hasten;	1
such	1
a	1
peal	1
shall	1
rouse	1
their	1
sleep.	1
Then,	1
all	1
thy	1
saints	1
assembled,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
judge	1
Bad	1
Men	1
and	1
Angels;	1
they,	1
arraigned,	1
shall	1
sink	1
Beneath	1
thy	1
sentence;	1
Hell,	1
her	1
numbers	1
full,	1
Thenceforth	1
shall	1
be	1
for	1
ever	1
shut.	1
Mean	1
while	1
The	1
world	1
shall	1
burn,	1
and	1
from	1
her	1
ashes	1
spring	1
New	1
Heaven	1
and	1
Earth,	1
wherein	1
the	1
just	1
shall	1
dwell,	1
And,	1
after	1
all	1
their	1
tribulations	1
long,	1
See	1
golden	1
days,	1
fruitful	1
of	1
golden	1
deeds,	1
With	1
joy	1
and	1
peace	1
triumphing,	1
and	1
fair	1
truth.	1
Then	1
thou	1
thy	1
regal	1
scepter	1
shalt	1
lay	1
by,	1
For	1
regal	1
scepter	1
then	1
no	1
more	1
shall	1
need,	1
God	1
shall	1
be	1
all	1
in	1
all.	1
But,	1
all	1
ye	1
Gods,	1
Adore	1
him,	1
who	1
to	1
compass	1
all	1
this	1
dies;	1
Adore	1
the	1
Son,	1
and	1
honour	1
him	1
as	1
me.	1
No	1
sooner	1
had	1
the	1
Almighty	1
ceased,	1
but	1
all	1
The	1
multitude	1
of	1
Angels,	1
with	1
a	1
shout	1
Loud	1
as	1
from	1
numbers	1
without	1
number,	1
sweet	1
As	1
from	1
blest	1
voices,	1
uttering	1
joy,	1
Heaven	1
rung	1
With	1
jubilee,	1
and	1
loud	1
Hosannas	1
filled	1
The	1
eternal	1
regions:	1
Lowly	1
reverent	1
Towards	1
either	1
throne	1
they	1
bow,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
ground	1
With	1
solemn	1
adoration	1
down	1
they	1
cast	1
Their	1
crowns	1
inwove	1
with	1
amarant	1
and	1
gold;	1
Immortal	1
amarant,	1
a	1
flower	1
which	1
once	1
In	1
Paradise,	1
fast	1
by	1
the	1
tree	1
of	1
life,	1
Began	1
to	1
bloom;	1
but	1
soon	1
for	1
man's	1
offence	1
To	1
Heaven	1
removed,	1
where	1
first	1
it	1
grew,	1
there	1
grows,	1
And	1
flowers	1
aloft	1
shading	1
the	1
fount	1
of	1
life,	1
And	1
where	1
the	1
river	1
of	1
bliss	1
through	1
midst	1
of	1
Heaven	1
Rolls	1
o'er	1
Elysian	1
flowers	1
her	1
amber	1
stream;	1
With	1
these	1
that	1
never	1
fade	1
the	1
Spirits	1
elect	1
Bind	1
their	1
resplendent	1
locks	1
inwreathed	1
with	1
beams;	1
Now	1
in	1
loose	1
garlands	1
thick	1
thrown	1
off,	1
the	1
bright	1
Pavement,	1
that	1
like	1
a	1
sea	1
of	1
jasper	1
shone,	1
Impurpled	1
with	1
celestial	1
roses	1
smiled.	1
Then,	1
crowned	1
again,	1
their	1
golden	1
harps	1
they	1
took,	1
Harps	1
ever	1
tuned,	1
that	1
glittering	1
by	1
their	1
side	1
Like	1
quivers	1
hung,	1
and	1
with	1
preamble	1
sweet	1
Of	1
charming	1
symphony	1
they	1
introduce	1
Their	1
sacred	1
song,	1
and	1
waken	1
raptures	1
high;	1
No	1
voice	1
exempt,	1
no	1
voice	1
but	1
well	1
could	1
join	1
Melodious	1
part,	1
such	1
concord	1
is	1
in	1
Heaven.	1
Thee,	1
Father,	1
first	1
they	1
sung	1
Omnipotent,	1
Immutable,	1
Immortal,	1
Infinite,	1
Eternal	1
King;	1
the	1
Author	1
of	1
all	1
being,	1
Fonntain	1
of	1
light,	1
thyself	1
invisible	1
Amidst	1
the	1
glorious	1
brightness	1
where	1
thou	1
sit'st	1
Throned	1
inaccessible,	1
but	1
when	1
thou	1
shadest	1
The	1
full	1
blaze	1
of	1
thy	1
beams,	1
and,	1
through	1
a	1
cloud	1
Drawn	1
round	1
about	1
thee	1
like	1
a	1
radiant	1
shrine,	1
Dark	1
with	1
excessive	1
bright	1
thy	1
skirts	1
appear,	1
Yet	1
dazzle	1
Heaven,	1
that	1
brightest	1
Seraphim	1
Approach	1
not,	1
but	1
with	1
both	1
wings	1
veil	1
their	1
eyes.	1
Thee	1
next	1
they	1
sang	1
of	1
all	1
creation	1
first,	1
Begotten	1
Son,	1
Divine	1
Similitude,	1
In	1
whose	1
conspicuous	1
countenance,	1
without	1
cloud	1
Made	1
visible,	1
the	1
Almighty	1
Father	1
shines,	1
Whom	1
else	1
no	1
creature	1
can	1
behold;	1
on	1
thee	1
Impressed	1
the	1
effulgence	1
of	1
his	1
glory	1
abides,	1
Transfused	1
on	1
thee	1
his	1
ample	1
Spirit	1
rests.	1
He	1
Heaven	1
of	1
Heavens	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
Powers	1
therein	1
By	1
thee	1
created;	1
and	1
by	1
thee	1
threw	1
down	1
The	1
aspiring	1
Dominations:	1
Thou	1
that	1
day	1
Thy	1
Father's	1
dreadful	1
thunder	1
didst	1
not	1
spare,	1
Nor	1
stop	1
thy	1
flaming	1
chariot-wheels,	1
that	1
shook	1
Heaven's	1
everlasting	1
frame,	1
while	1
o'er	1
the	1
necks	1
Thou	1
drovest	1
of	1
warring	1
Angels	1
disarrayed.	1
Back	1
from	1
pursuit	1
thy	1
Powers	1
with	1
loud	1
acclaim	1
Thee	1
only	1
extolled,	1
Son	1
of	1
thy	1
Father's	1
might,	1
To	1
execute	1
fierce	1
vengeance	1
on	1
his	1
foes,	1
Not	1
so	1
on	1
Man:	1
Him	1
through	1
their	1
malice	1
fallen,	1
Father	1
of	1
mercy	1
and	1
grace,	1
thou	1
didst	1
not	1
doom	1
So	1
strictly,	1
but	1
much	1
more	1
to	1
pity	1
incline:	1
No	1
sooner	1
did	1
thy	1
dear	1
and	1
only	1
Son	1
Perceive	1
thee	1
purposed	1
not	1
to	1
doom	1
frail	1
Man	1
So	1
strictly,	1
but	1
much	1
more	1
to	1
pity	1
inclined,	1
He	1
to	1
appease	1
thy	1
wrath,	1
and	1
end	1
the	1
strife	1
Of	1
mercy	1
and	1
justice	1
in	1
thy	1
face	1
discerned,	1
Regardless	1
of	1
the	1
bliss	1
wherein	1
he	1
sat	1
Second	1
to	1
thee,	1
offered	1
himself	1
to	1

For	1
Man's	1
offence.	1
O	1
unexampled	1
love,	1
Love	1
no	1
where	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
less	1
than	1
Divine!	1
Hail,	1
Son	1
of	1
God,	1
Saviour	1
of	1
Men!	1
Thy	1
name	1
Shall	1
be	1
the	1
copious	1
matter	1
of	1
my	1
song	1
Henceforth,	1
and	1
never	1
shall	1
my	1
heart	1
thy	1
praise	1
Forget,	1
nor	1
from	1
thy	1
Father's	1
praise	1
disjoin.	1
Thus	1
they	1
in	1
Heaven,	1
above	1
the	1
starry	1
sphere,	1
Their	1
happy	1
hours	1
in	1
joy	1
and	1
hymning	1
spent.	1
Mean	1
while	1
upon	1
the	1
firm	1
opacous	1
globe	1
Of	1
this	1
round	1
world,	1
whose	1
first	1
convex	1
divides	1
The	1
luminous	1
inferiour	1
orbs,	1
enclosed	1
From	1
Chaos,	1
and	1
the	1
inroad	1
of	1
Darkness	1
old,	1
Satan	1
alighted	1
walks:	1
A	1
globe	1
far	1
off	1
It	1
seemed,	1
now	1
seems	1
a	1
boundless	1
continent	1
Dark,	1
waste,	1
and	1
wild,	1
under	1
the	1
frown	1
of	1
Night	1
Starless	1
exposed,	1
and	1
ever-threatening	1
storms	1
Of	1
Chaos	1
blustering	1
round,	1
inclement	1
sky;	1
Save	1
on	1
that	1
side	1
which	1
from	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
Heaven,	1
Though	1
distant	1
far,	1
some	1
small	1
reflection	1
gains	1
Of	1
glimmering	1
air	1
less	1
vexed	1
with	1
tempest	1
loud:	1
Here	1
walked	1
the	1
Fiend	1
at	1
large	1
in	1
spacious	1
field.	1
As	1
when	1
a	1
vultur	1
on	1
Imaus	1
bred,	1
Whose	1
snowy	1
ridge	1
the	1
roving	1
Tartar	1
bounds,	1
Dislodging	1
from	1
a	1
region	1
scarce	1
of	1
prey	1
To	1
gorge	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
lambs	1
or	1
yeanling	1
kids,	1
On	1
hills	1
where	1
flocks	1
are	1
fed,	1
flies	1
toward	1
the	1
springs	1
Of	1
Ganges	1
or	1
Hydaspes,	1
Indian	1
streams;	1
But	1
in	1
his	1
way	1
lights	1
on	1
the	1
barren	1
plains	1
Of	1
Sericana,	1
where	1
Chineses	1
drive	1
With	1
sails	1
and	1
wind	1
their	1
cany	1
waggons	1
light:	1
So,	1
on	1
this	1
windy	1
sea	1
of	1
land,	1
the	1
Fiend	1
Walked	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
alone,	1
bent	1
on	1
his	1
prey;	1
Alone,	1
for	1
other	1
creature	1
in	1
this	1
place,	1
Living	1
or	1
lifeless,	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
was	1
none;	1
None	1
yet,	1
but	1
store	1
hereafter	1
from	1
the	1
earth	1
Up	1
hither	1
like	1
aereal	1
vapours	1
flew	1
Of	1
all	1
things	1
transitory	1
and	1
vain,	1
when	1
sin	1
With	1
vanity	1
had	1
filled	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
men:	1
Both	1
all	1
things	1
vain,	1
and	1
all	1
who	1
in	1
vain	1
things	1
Built	1
their	1
fond	1
hopes	1
of	1
glory	1
or	1
lasting	1
fame,	1
Or	1
happiness	1
in	1
this	1
or	1
the	1
other	1

All	1
who	1
have	1
their	1
reward	1
on	1
earth,	1
the	1
fruits	1
Of	1
painful	1
superstition	1
and	1
blind	1
zeal,	1
Nought	1
seeking	1
but	1
the	1
praise	1
of	1
men,	1
here	1
find	1
Fit	1
retribution,	1
empty	1
as	1
their	1
deeds;	1
All	1
the	1
unaccomplished	1
works	1
of	1
Nature's	1
hand,	1
Abortive,	1
monstrous,	1
or	1
unkindly	1
mixed,	1
Dissolved	1
on	1
earth,	1
fleet	1
hither,	1
and	1
in	1
vain,	1
Till	1
final	1
dissolution,	1
wander	1
here;	1
Not	1
in	1
the	1
neighbouring	1
moon	1
as	1
some	1
have	1
dreamed;	1
Those	1
argent	1

Translated	1
Saints,	1
or	1
middle	1
Spirits	1
hold	1
Betwixt	1
the	1

Hither	1
of	1
ill-joined	1
sons	1
and	1
daughters	1
born	1
First	1
from	1
the	1
ancient	1
world	1
those	1
giants	1
came	1
With	1
many	1
a	1
vain	1
exploit,	1
though	1
then	1
renowned:	1
The	1
builders	1
next	1
of	1
Babel	1
on	1
the	1
plain	1
Of	1
Sennaar,	1
and	1
still	1
with	1
vain	1
design,	1
New	1
Babels,	1
had	1
they	1
wherewithal,	1
would	1
build:	1
Others	1
came	1
single;	1
he,	1
who,	1
to	1
be	1
deemed	1
A	1
God,	1
leaped	1
fondly	1
into	1
Aetna	1
flames,	1
Empedocles;	1
and	1
he,	1
who,	1
to	1
enjoy	1
Plato's	1
Elysium,	1
leaped	1
into	1
the	1
sea,	1
Cleombrotus;	1
and	1
many	1
more	1
too	1
long,	1
Embryos,	1
and	1
idiots,	1
eremites,	1
and	1
friars	1
White,	1
black,	1
and	1
gray,	1
with	1
all	1
their	1
trumpery.	1
Here	1
pilgrims	1
roam,	1
that	1
strayed	1
so	1
far	1
to	1
seek	1
In	1
Golgotha	1
him	1
dead,	1
who	1
lives	1
in	1
Heaven;	1
And	1
they,	1
who	1
to	1
be	1
sure	1
of	1
Paradise,	1
Dying,	1
put	1
on	1
the	1
weeds	1
of	1
Dominick,	1
Or	1
in	1
Franciscan	1
think	1
to	1
pass	1
disguised;	1
They	1
pass	1
the	1
planets	1
seven,	1
and	1
pass	1
the	1
fixed,	1
And	1
that	1
crystalling	1
sphere	1
whose	1
balance	1
weighs	1
The	1
trepidation	1
talked,	1
and	1
that	1
first	1
moved;	1
And	1
now	1
Saint	1
Peter	1
at	1
Heaven's	1
wicket	1
seems	1
To	1
wait	1
them	1
with	1
his	1
keys,	1
and	1
now	1
at	1
foot	1
Of	1
Heaven's	1
ascent	1
they	1
lift	1
their	1
feet,	1
when	1
lo	1
A	1
violent	1
cross	1
wind	1
from	1
either	1
coast	1
Blows	1
them	1
transverse,	1
ten	1
thousand	1
leagues	1
awry	1
Into	1
the	1
devious	1
air:	1
Then	1
might	1
ye	1
see	1
Cowls,	1
hoods,	1
and	1
habits,	1
with	1
their	1
wearers,	1
tost	1
And	1
fluttered	1
into	1
rags;	1
then	1
reliques,	1
beads,	1
Indulgences,	1
dispenses,	1
pardons,	1
bulls,	1
The	1
sport	1
of	1
winds:	1
All	1
these,	1
upwhirled	1
aloft,	1
Fly	1
o'er	1
the	1
backside	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
far	1
off	1
Into	1
a	1
Limbo	1
large	1
and	1
broad,	1
since	1
called	1
The	1
Paradise	1
of	1
Fools,	1
to	1
few	1
unknown	1
Long	1
after;	1
now	1
unpeopled,	1
and	1
untrod.	1
All	1
this	1
dark	1
globe	1
the	1
Fiend	1
found	1
as	1
he	1
passed,	1
And	1
long	1
he	1
wandered,	1
till	1
at	1
last	1
a	1
gleam	1
Of	1
dawning	1
light	1
turned	1
thither-ward	1
in	1
haste	1
His	1
travelled	1
steps:	1
far	1
distant	1
he	1
descries	1
Ascending	1
by	1
degrees	1
magnificent	1
Up	1
to	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
Heaven	1
a	1
structure	1
high;	1
At	1
top	1
whereof,	1
but	1
far	1
more	1
rich,	1
appeared	1
The	1
work	1
as	1
of	1
a	1
kingly	1
palace-gate,	1
With	1
frontispiece	1
of	1
diamond	1
and	1
gold	1
Embellished;	1
thick	1
with	1
sparkling	1
orient	1
gems	1
The	1
portal	1
shone,	1
inimitable	1
on	1
earth	1
By	1
model,	1
or	1
by	1
shading	1
pencil,	1
drawn.	1
These	1
stairs	1
were	1
such	1
as	1
whereon	1
Jacob	1
saw	1
Angels	1
ascending	1
and	1
descending,	1
bands	1
Of	1
guardians	1
bright,	1
when	1
he	1
from	1
Esau	1
fled	1
To	1
Padan-Aram,	1
in	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
Luz	1
Dreaming	1
by	1
night	1
under	1
the	1
open	1
sky	1
And	1
waking	1
cried,	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
Heaven.	1
Each	1
stair	1
mysteriously	1
was	1
meant,	1
nor	1
stood	1
There	1
always,	1
but	1
drawn	1
up	1
to	1
Heaven	1
sometimes	1
Viewless;	1
and	1
underneath	1
a	1
bright	1
sea	1
flowed	1
Of	1
jasper,	1
or	1
of	1
liquid	1
pearl,	1
whereon	1
Who	1
after	1
came	1
from	1
earth,	1
failing	1
arrived	1
Wafted	1
by	1
Angels,	1
or	1
flew	1
o'er	1
the	1
lake	1
Rapt	1
in	1
a	1
chariot	1
drawn	1
by	1
fiery	1
steeds.	1
The	1
stairs	1
were	1
then	1
let	1
down,	1
whether	1
to	1
dare	1
The	1
Fiend	1
by	1
easy	1
ascent,	1
or	1
aggravate	1
His	1
sad	1
exclusion	1
from	1
the	1
doors	1
of	1
bliss:	1
Direct	1
against	1
which	1
opened	1
from	1
beneath,	1
Just	1
o'er	1
the	1
blissful	1
seat	1
of	1
Paradise,	1
A	1
passage	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
Earth,	1
a	1
passage	1
wide,	1
Wider	1
by	1
far	1
than	1
that	1
of	1
after-times	1
Over	1
mount	1
Sion,	1
and,	1
though	1
that	1
were	1
large,	1
Over	1
the	1
Promised	1
Land	1
to	1
God	1
so	1
dear;	1
By	1
which,	1
to	1
visit	1
oft	1
those	1
happy	1
tribes,	1
On	1
high	1
behests	1
his	1
angels	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
Passed	1
frequent,	1
and	1
his	1
eye	1
with	1
choice	1
regard	1
From	1
Paneas,	1
the	1
fount	1
of	1
Jordan's	1
flood,	1
To	1
Beersaba,	1
where	1
the	1
Holy	1
Land	1
Borders	1
on	1
Egypt	1
and	1
the	1
Arabian	1
shore;	1
So	1
wide	1
the	1
opening	1
seemed,	1
where	1
bounds	1
were	1
set	1
To	1
darkness,	1
such	1
as	1
bound	1
the	1
ocean	1
wave.	1
Satan	1
from	1
hence,	1
now	1
on	1
the	1
lower	1
stair,	1
That	1
scaled	1
by	1
steps	1
of	1
gold	1
to	1
Heaven-gate,	1
Looks	1
down	1
with	1
wonder	1
at	1
the	1
sudden	1
view	1
Of	1
all	1
this	1
world	1
at	1
once.	1
As	1

the	1
brow	1
of	1
some	1
high-climbing	1
hill,	1
Which	1
to	1
his	1
eye	1
discovers	1
unaware	1
The	1
goodly	1
prospect	1
of	1
some	1
foreign	1
land	1
First	1
seen,	1
or	1
some	1
renowned	1
metropolis	1
With	1
glistering	1
spires	1
and	1
pinnacles	1
adorned,	1
Which	1
now	1
the	1
rising	1
sun	1
gilds	1
with	1
his	1
beams:	1
Such	1
wonder	1
seised,	1
though	1
after	1
Heaven	1
seen,	1
The	1
Spirit	1
malign,	1
but	1
much	1
more	1
envy	1
seised,	1
At	1
sight	1
of	1
all	1
this	1
world	1
beheld	1
so	1
fair.	1
Round	1
he	1
surveys	1
(and	1
well	1
might,	1
where	1
he	1
stood	1
So	1
high	1
above	1
the	1
circling	1
canopy	1
Of	1
night's	1
extended	1
shade,)	1
from	1
eastern	1

Of	1

the	1
fleecy	1

that	1
bears	1
Andromeda	1

off	1
Atlantick	1

Beyond	1

from	1

and	1
without	1
longer	1
pause	1
Down	1

into	1
the	1
world's	1
first	1
region	1
throws	1
His	1
flight	1
precipitant,	1
and	1
winds	1
with	1
ease	1
Through	1
the	1
pure	1
marble	1
air	1
his	1
oblique	1
way	1
Amongst	1
innumerable	1
stars,	1
that	1
shone	1
Stars	1
distant,	1
but	1
nigh	1
hand	1
seemed	1
other	1
worlds;	1
Or	1
other	1
worlds	1
they	1
seemed,	1
or	1
happy	1
isles,	1
Like	1
those	1
Hesperian	1
gardens	1
famed	1
of	1
old,	1
Fortunate	1
fields,	1
and	1

and	1
flowery	1

Thrice	1
happy	1
isles;	1
but	1
who	1
dwelt	1
happy	1
there	1
He	1
staid	1
not	1
to	1
inquire:	1
Above	1
them	1
all	1
The	1
golden	1
sun,	1
in	1
splendour	1
likest	1
Heaven,	1
Allured	1
his	1
eye;	1
thither	1
his	1
course	1
he	1
bends	1
Through	1
the	1
calm	1
firmament,	1
(but	1
up	1
or	1
down,	1
By	1
center,	1
or	1
eccentrick,	1
hard	1
to	1
tell,	1
Or	1

where	1
the	1
great	1

That	1
from	1
his	1
lordly	1

distance	1

Dispenses	1
light	1
from	1
far;	1
they,	1
as	1
they	1
move	1
Their	1
starry	1
dance	1
in	1
numbers	1
that	1
compute	1
Days,	1
months,	1
and	1

towards	1
his	1
all-cheering	1
lamp	1
Turn	1
swift	1
their	1
various	1
motions,	1
or	1
are	1
turned	1
By	1
his	1
magnetick	1

that	1
gently	1
warms	1
The	1
universe,	1
and	1
to	1
each	1

With	1
gentle	1
penetration,	1
though	1
unseen,	1
Shoots	1
invisible	1
virtue	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
deep;	1
So	1
wonderously	1
was	1
set	1
his	1
station	1
bright.	1
There	1
lands	1
the	1
Fiend,	1
a	1
spot	1
like	1
which	1
perhaps	1
Astronomer	1
in	1
the	1
sun's	1
lucent	1
orb	1
Through	1
his	1
glazed	1
optick	1
tube	1
yet	1
never	1
saw.	1
The	1
place	1
he	1
found	1
beyond	1
expression	1
bright,	1
Compared	1
with	1
aught	1
on	1
earth,	1
metal	1
or	1
stone;	1
Not	1
all	1
parts	1
like,	1
but	1
all	1
alike	1
informed	1
With	1
radiant	1
light,	1
as	1
glowing	1
iron	1
with	1
fire;	1
If	1
metal,	1
part	1
seemed	1
gold,	1
part	1
silver	1
clear;	1
If	1
stone,	1
carbuncle	1
most	1
or	1
chrysolite,	1
Ruby	1
or	1
topaz,	1
to	1
the	1
twelve	1
that	1
shone	1
In	1
Aaron's	1
breast-plate,	1
and	1
a	1
stone	1
besides	1
Imagined	1
rather	1
oft	1
than	1
elsewhere	1
seen,	1
That	1
stone,	1
or	1
like	1
to	1
that	1
which	1
here	1
below	1
Philosophers	1
in	1
vain	1
so	1
long	1
have	1
sought,	1
In	1
vain,	1
though	1
by	1
their	1
powerful	1
art	1
they	1
bind	1
Volatile	1
Hermes,	1
and	1
call	1
up	1
unbound	1
In	1
various	1
shapes	1
old	1
Proteus	1
from	1
the	1
sea,	1
Drained	1
through	1
a	1
limbeck	1
to	1
his	1
native	1
form.	1
What	1
wonder	1
then	1
if	1
fields	1
and	1
regions	1
here	1
Breathe	1
forth	1
Elixir	1
pure,	1
and	1
rivers	1
run	1
Potable	1
gold,	1
when	1
with	1
one	1
virtuous	1
touch	1
The	1
arch-chemick	1
sun,	1
so	1
far	1
from	1
us	1
remote,	1
Produces,	1
with	1
terrestrial	1
humour	1
mixed,	1
Here	1
in	1
the	1
dark	1
so	1
many	1
precious	1
things	1
Of	1
colour	1
glorious,	1
and	1
effect	1
so	1
rare?	1
Here	1
matter	1
new	1
to	1
gaze	1
the	1
Devil	1
met	1
Undazzled;	1
far	1
and	1
wide	1
his	1
eye	1
commands;	1
For	1
sight	1
no	1
obstacle	1
found	1
here,	1
nor	1
shade,	1
But	1
all	1
sun-shine,	1
as	1
when	1
his	1
beams	1
at	1
noon	1
Culminate	1
from	1
the	1
equator,	1
as	1
they	1
now	1
Shot	1
upward	1
still	1
direct,	1
whence	1
no	1
way	1
round	1
Shadow	1
from	1
body	1
opaque	1
can	1
fall;	1
and	1
the	1
air,	1
No	1
where	1
so	1
clear,	1
sharpened	1
his	1
visual	1
ray	1
To	1
objects	1
distant	1
far,	1
whereby	1
he	1
soon	1
Saw	1
within	1
ken	1
a	1
glorious	1
Angel	1
stand,	1
The	1
same	1
whom	1
John	1
saw	1
also	1
in	1
the	1
sun:	1
His	1
back	1
was	1
turned,	1
but	1
not	1
his	1
brightness	1
hid;	1
Of	1
beaming	1
sunny	1
rays	1
a	1
golden	1
tiar	1
Circled	1
his	1
head,	1
nor	1
less	1
his	1
locks	1
behind	1
Illustrious	1
on	1
his	1
shoulders	1
fledge	1
with	1
wings	1
Lay	1
waving	1
round;	1
on	1
some	1
great	1
charge	1
employed	1
He	1
seemed,	1
or	1
fixed	1
in	1
cogitation	1
deep.	1
Glad	1
was	1
the	1
Spirit	1
impure,	1
as	1
now	1
in	1
hope	1
To	1
find	1
who	1
might	1
direct	1
his	1
wandering	1
flight	1
To	1
Paradise,	1
the	1
happy	1
seat	1
of	1
Man,	1
His	1
journey's	1
end	1
and	1
our	1
beginning	1
woe.	1
But	1
first	1
he	1
casts	1
to	1
change	1
his	1
proper	1
shape,	1
Which	1
else	1
might	1
work	1
him	1
danger	1
or	1
delay:	1
And	1
now	1
a	1
stripling	1
Cherub	1
he	1
appears,	1
Not	1
of	1
the	1
prime,	1
yet	1
such	1
as	1
in	1
his	1
face	1
Youth	1
smiled	1
celestial,	1
and	1
to	1
every	1
limb	1
Suitable	1
grace	1
diffused,	1
so	1
well	1
he	1
feigned:	1
Under	1
a	1
coronet	1
his	1
flowing	1
hair	1
In	1
curls	1
on	1
either	1
cheek	1
played;	1
wings	1
he	1
wore	1
Of	1
many	1
a	1
coloured	1
plume,	1
sprinkled	1
with	1
gold;	1
His	1
habit	1
fit	1
for	1
speed	1
succinct,	1
and	1
held	1
Before	1
his	1
decent	1
steps	1
a	1
silver	1
wand.	1
He	1
drew	1
not	1
nigh	1
unheard;	1
the	1
Angel	1
bright,	1
Ere	1
he	1
drew	1
nigh,	1
his	1
radiant	1
visage	1
turned,	1
Admonished	1
by	1
his	1
ear,	1
and	1
straight	1
was	1
known	1
The	1
Arch-Angel	1
Uriel,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
seven	1
Who	1
in	1
God's	1
presence,	1
nearest	1
to	1
his	1
throne,	1
Stand	1
ready	1
at	1
command,	1
and	1
are	1
his	1
eyes	1
That	1
run	1
through	1
all	1
the	1
Heavens,	1
or	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
Earth	1
Bear	1
his	1
swift	1
errands	1
over	1
moist	1
and	1
dry,	1
O'er	1
sea	1
and	1
land:	1
him	1
Satan	1
thus	1
accosts.	1
Uriel,	1
for	1
thou	1
of	1
those	1
seven	1
Spirits	1
that	1
stand	1
In	1
sight	1
of	1
God's	1
high	1
throne,	1
gloriously	1
bright,	1
The	1
first	1
art	1
wont	1
his	1
great	1
authentick	1
will	1
Interpreter	1
through	1
highest	1
Heaven	1
to	1
bring,	1
Where	1
all	1
his	1
sons	1
thy	1
embassy	1
attend;	1
And	1
here	1
art	1
likeliest	1
by	1
supreme	1
decree	1
Like	1
honour	1
to	1
obtain,	1
and	1
as	1
his	1
eye	1
To	1
visit	1
oft	1
this	1
new	1
creation	1
round;	1
Unspeakable	1
desire	1
to	1
see,	1
and	1
know	1
All	1
these	1
his	1
wonderous	1
works,	1
but	1
chiefly	1
Man,	1
His	1
chief	1
delight	1
and	1
favour,	1
him	1
for	1
whom	1
All	1
these	1
his	1
works	1
so	1
wonderous	1
he	1
ordained,	1
Hath	1
brought	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
quires	1
of	1
Cherubim	1
Alone	1
thus	1
wandering.	1
Brightest	1
Seraph,	1
tell	1
In	1
which	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
shining	1
orbs	1
hath	1
Man	1
His	1
fixed	1
seat,	1
or	1
fixed	1
seat	1
hath	1
none,	1
But	1
all	1
these	1
shining	1
orbs	1
his	1
choice	1
to	1
dwell;	1
That	1
I	1
may	1
find	1
him,	1
and	1
with	1
secret	1
gaze	1
Or	1
open	1
admiration	1
him	1
behold,	1
On	1
whom	1
the	1
great	1
Creator	1
hath	1
bestowed	1
Worlds,	1
and	1
on	1
whom	1
hath	1
all	1
these	1
graces	1
poured;	1
That	1
both	1
in	1
him	1
and	1
all	1
things,	1
as	1
is	1
meet,	1
The	1
universal	1
Maker	1
we	1
may	1
praise;	1
Who	1
justly	1
hath	1
driven	1
out	1
his	1
rebel	1
foes	1
To	1
deepest	1
Hell,	1
and,	1
to	1
repair	1
that	1
loss,	1
Created	1
this	1
new	1
happy	1
race	1
of	1
Men	1
To	1
serve	1
him	1
better:	1
Wise	1
are	1
all	1
his	1
ways.	1
So	1
spake	1
the	1
false	1
dissembler	1
unperceived;	1
For	1
neither	1
Man	1
nor	1
Angel	1
can	1
discern	1
Hypocrisy,	1
the	1
only	1
evil	1
that	1
walks	1
Invisible,	1
except	1
to	1
God	1
alone,	1
By	1
his	1
permissive	1
will,	1
through	1
Heaven	1
and	1
Earth:	1
And	1
oft,	1
though	1
wisdom	1
wake,	1
suspicion	1
sleeps	1
At	1
wisdom's	1
gate,	1
and	1
to	1
simplicity	1
Resigns	1
her	1
charge,	1
while	1
goodness	1
thinks	1
no	1
ill	1
Where	1
no	1
ill	1
seems:	1
Which	1
now	1
for	1
once	1
beguiled	1
Uriel,	1
though	1
regent	1
of	1
the	1
sun,	1
and	1
held	1
The	1
sharpest-sighted	1
Spirit	1
of	1
all	1
in	1
Heaven;	1
Who	1
to	1
the	1
fraudulent	1
impostor	1
foul,	1
In	1
his	1
uprightness,	1
answer	1
thus	1
returned.	1
Fair	1
Angel,	1
thy	1
desire,	1
which	1
tends	1
to	1
know	1
The	1
works	1
of	1
God,	1
thereby	1
to	1
glorify	1
The	1
great	1
Work-master,	1
leads	1
to	1
no	1
excess	1
That	1
reaches	1
blame,	1
but	1
rather	1
merits	1
praise	1
The	1
more	1
it	1
seems	1
excess,	1
that	1
led	1
thee	1
hither	1
From	1
thy	1
empyreal	1
mansion	1
thus	1
alone,	1
To	1
witness	1
with	1
thine	1
eyes	1
what	1
some	1
perhaps,	1
Contented	1
with	1
report,	1
hear	1
only	1
in	1
Heaven:	1
For	1
wonderful	1
indeed	1
are	1
all	1
his	1
works,	1
Pleasant	1
to	1
know,	1
and	1
worthiest	1
to	1
be	1
all	1
Had	1
in	1
remembrance	1
always	1
with	1
delight;	1
But	1
what	1
created	1
mind	1
can	1
comprehend	1
Their	1
number,	1
or	1
the	1
wisdom	1
infinite	1
That	1
brought	1
them	1
forth,	1
but	1
hid	1
their	1
causes	1
deep?	1
I	1
saw	1
when	1
at	1
his	1
word	1
the	1
formless	1
mass,	1
This	1
world's	1
material	1
mould,	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
heap:	1
Confusion	1
heard	1
his	1
voice,	1
and	1
wild	1
uproar	1
Stood	1
ruled,	1
stood	1
vast	1
infinitude	1
confined;	1
Till	1
at	1
his	1
second	1
bidding	1
Darkness	1
fled,	1
Light	1
shone,	1
and	1
order	1
from	1
disorder	1
sprung:	1
Swift	1
to	1
their	1
several	1
quarters	1
hasted	1
then	1
The	1
cumbrous	1
elements,	1
earth,	1
flood,	1
air,	1
fire;	1
And	1
this	1
ethereal	1
quintessence	1
of	1
Heaven	1
Flew	1
upward,	1
spirited	1
with	1
various	1
forms,	1
That	1
rolled	1
orbicular,	1
and	1
turned	1
to	1
stars	1
Numberless,	1
as	1
thou	1
seest,	1
and	1
how	1
they	1
move;	1
Each	1
had	1
his	1
place	1
appointed,	1
each	1
his	1
course;	1
The	1
rest	1
in	1
circuit	1
walls	1
this	1
universe.	1
Look	1
downward	1
on	1
that	1
globe,	1
whose	1
hither	1
side	1
With	1
light	1
from	1
hence,	1
though	1
but	1
reflected,	1
shines;	1
That	1
place	1
is	1
Earth,	1
the	1
seat	1
of	1
Man;	1
that	1
light	1
His	1
day,	1
which	1
else,	1
as	1
the	1
other	1
hemisphere,	1
Night	1
would	1
invade;	1
but	1
there	1
the	1
neighbouring	1
moon	1
So	1
call	1
that	1
opposite	1
fair	1
star)	1
her	1
aid	1
Timely	1
interposes,	1
and	1
her	1
monthly	1
round	1
Still	1
ending,	1
still	1
renewing,	1
through	1
mid	1
Heaven,	1
With	1
borrowed	1
light	1
her	1
countenance	1
triform	1
Hence	1
fills	1
and	1
empties	1
to	1
enlighten	1
the	1
Earth,	1
And	1
in	1
her	1
pale	1
dominion	1
checks	1
the	1
night.	1
That	1
spot,	1
to	1
which	1
I	1
point,	1
is	1
Paradise,	1
Adam's	1
abode;	1
those	1
lofty	1
shades,	1
his	1
bower.	1
Thy	1
way	1
thou	1
canst	1
not	1
miss,	1
me	1
mine	1
requires.	1
Thus	1
said,	1
he	1
turned;	1
and	1
Satan,	1
bowing	1
low,	1
As	1
to	1
superiour	1
Spirits	1
is	1
wont	1
in	1
Heaven,	1
Where	1
honour	1
due	1
and	1
reverence	1
none	1
neglects,	1
Took	1
leave,	1
and	1
toward	1
the	1
coast	1
of	1
earth	1
beneath,	1
Down	1
from	1
the	1
ecliptick,	1
sped	1
with	1
hoped	1
success,	1
Throws	1
his	1
steep	1
flight	1
in	1
many	1
an	1
aery	1
wheel;	1
Nor	1
staid,	1
till	1
on	1
Niphates'	1
top	1
he	1
lights.	1
Book	1
IV	1
O,	1
for	1
that	1
warning	1
voice,	1
which	1
he,	1
who	1
saw	1
The	1
Apocalypse,	1
heard	1
cry	1
in	1
Heaven	1
aloud,	1
Then	1
when	1
the	1
Dragon,	1
put	1
to	1
second	1
rout,	1
Came	1
furious	1
down	1
to	1
be	1
revenged	1
on	1
men,	1
Woe	1
to	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
on	1
earth!	1
that	1
now,	1
While	1
time	1
was,	1
our	1
first	1
parents	1
had	1
been	1
warned	1
The	1
coming	1
of	1
their	1
secret	1
foe,	1
and	1
'scaped,	1
Haply	1
so	1
'scaped	1
his	1
mortal	1
snare:	1
For	1
now	1
Satan,	1
now	1
first	1
inflamed	1
with	1
rage,	1
came	1
down,	1
The	1
tempter	1
ere	1
the	1
accuser	1
of	1
mankind,	1
To	1
wreak	1
on	1
innocent	1
frail	1
Man	1
his	1
loss	1
Of	1
that	1
first	1
battle,	1
and	1
his	1
flight	1
to	1
Hell:	1
Yet,	1
not	1
rejoicing	1
in	1
his	1
speed,	1
though	1
bold	1
Far	1
off	1
and	1
fearless,	1
nor	1
with	1
cause	1
to	1
boast,	1
Begins	1
his	1
dire	1
attempt;	1
which	1
nigh	1
the	1
birth	1
Now	1
rolling	1
boils	1
in	1
his	1
tumultuous	1
breast,	1
And	1
like	1
a	1
devilish	1
engine	1
back	1
recoils	1
Upon	1
himself;	1
horrour	1
and	1
doubt	1
distract	1
His	1
troubled	1
thoughts,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
bottom	1
stir	1
The	1
Hell	1
within	1
him;	1
for	1
within	1
him	1
Hell	1
He	1
brings,	1
and	1
round	1
about	1
him,	1
nor	1
from	1
Hell	1
One	1
step,	1
no	1
more	1
than	1
from	1
himself,	1
can	1
fly	1
By	1
change	1
of	1
place:	1
Now	1
conscience	1
wakes	1
despair,	1
That	1
slumbered;	1
wakes	1
the	1
bitter	1
memory	1
Of	1
what	1
he	1
was,	1
what	1
is,	1
and	1
what	1
must	1
be	1
Worse;	1
of	1
worse	1
deeds	1
worse	1
sufferings	1
must	1
ensue.	1
Sometimes	1
towards	1
Eden,	1
which	1
now	1
in	1
his	1
view	1
Lay	1
pleasant,	1
his	1
grieved	1
look	1
he	1
fixes	1
sad;	1
Sometimes	1
towards	1
Heaven,	1
and	1
the	1
full-blazing	1
sun,	1
Which	1
now	1
sat	1
high	1
in	1
his	1
meridian	1
tower:	1
Then,	1
much	1
revolving,	1
thus	1
in	1
sighs	1
began.	1
O	1
thou,	1
that,	1
with	1
surpassing	1
glory	1
crowned,	1
Lookest	1
from	1
thy	1
sole	1
dominion	1
like	1
the	1
God	1
Of	1
this	1
new	1
world;	1
at	1
whose	1
sight	1
all	1
the	1
stars	1
Hide	1
their	1
diminished	1
heads;	1
to	1
thee	1
I	1
call,	1
But	1
with	1
no	1
friendly	1
voice,	1
and	1
add	1
thy	1
name,	1
Of	1
Sun!	1
to	1
tell	1
thee	1
how	1
I	1
hate	1
thy	1
beams,	1
That	1
bring	1
to	1
my	1
remembrance	1
from	1
what	1
state	1
I	1
fell,	1
how	1
glorious	1
once	1
above	1
thy	1
sphere;	1
Till	1
pride	1
and	1
worse	1
ambition	1
threw	1
me	1
down	1
Warring	1
in	1
Heaven	1
against	1
Heaven's	1
matchless	1
King:	1
Ah,	1
wherefore!	1
he	1
deserved	1
no	1
such	1
return	1
From	1
me,	1
whom	1
he	1
created	1
what	1
I	1
was	1
In	1
that	1
bright	1
eminence,	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
good	1
Upbraided	1
none;	1
nor	1
was	1
his	1
service	1
hard.	1
What	1
could	1
be	1
less	1
than	1
to	1
afford	1
him	1
praise,	1
The	1
easiest	1
recompence,	1
and	1
pay	1
him	1
thanks,	1
How	1
due!	1
yet	1
all	1
his	1
good	1
proved	1
ill	1
in	1
me,	1
And	1
wrought	1
but	1
malice;	1
lifted	1
up	1
so	1
high	1
I	1
sdeined	1
subjection,	1
and	1
thought	1
one	1
step	1
higher	1
Would	1
set	1
me	1
highest,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
moment	1
quit	1
The	1
debt	1
immense	1
of	1
endless	1
gratitude,	1
So	1
burdensome	1
still	1
paying,	1
still	1
to	1
owe,	1
Forgetful	1
what	1
from	1
him	1
I	1
still	1
received,	1
And	1
understood	1
not	1
that	1
a	1
grateful	1
mind	1
By	1
owing	1
owes	1
not,	1
but	1
still	1
pays,	1
at	1
once	1
Indebted	1
and	1
discharged;	1
what	1
burden	1
then	1
O,	1
had	1
his	1
powerful	1
destiny	1
ordained	1
Me	1
some	1
inferiour	1
Angel,	1
I	1
had	1
stood	1
Then	1
happy;	1
no	1
unbounded	1
hope	1
had	1
raised	1
Ambition!	1
Yet	1
why	1
not	1
some	1
other	1
Power	1
As	1
great	1
might	1
have	1
aspired,	1
and	1
me,	1
though	1
mean,	1
Drawn	1
to	1
his	1
part;	1
but	1
other	1
Powers	1
as	1
great	1
Fell	1
not,	1
but	1
stand	1
unshaken,	1
from	1
within	1
Or	1
from	1
without,	1
to	1
all	1
temptations	1
armed.	1
Hadst	1
thou	1
the	1
same	1
free	1
will	1
and	1
power	1
to	1
stand?	1
Thou	1
hadst:	1
whom	1
hast	1
thou	1
then	1
or	1
what	1
to	1
accuse,	1
But	1
Heaven's	1
free	1
love	1
dealt	1
equally	1
to	1
all?	1
Be	1
then	1
his	1
love	1
accursed,	1
since	1
love	1
or	1
hate,	1
To	1
me	1
alike,	1
it	1
deals	1
eternal	1
woe.	1
Nay,	1
cursed	1
be	1
thou;	1
since	1
against	1
his	1
thy	1
will	1
Chose	1
freely	1
what	1
it	1
now	1
so	1
justly	1
rues.	1
Me	1
miserable!	1
which	1
way	1
shall	1
I	1
fly	1
Infinite	1
wrath,	1
and	1
infinite	1
despair?	1
Which	1
way	1
I	1
fly	1
is	1
Hell;	1
myself	1
am	1
Hell;	1
And,	1
in	1
the	1
lowest	1
deep,	1
a	1
lower	1
deep	1
Still	1
threatening	1
to	1
devour	1
me	1
opens	1
wide,	1
To	1
which	1
the	1
Hell	1
I	1
suffer	1
seems	1
a	1
Heaven.	1
O,	1
then,	1
at	1
last	1
relent:	1
Is	1
there	1
no	1
place	1
Left	1
for	1
repentance,	1
none	1
for	1
pardon	1
left?	1
None	1
left	1
but	1
by	1
submission;	1
and	1
that	1
word	1
Disdain	1
forbids	1
me,	1
and	1
my	1
dread	1
of	1
shame	1
Among	1
the	1
Spirits	1
beneath,	1
whom	1
I	1
seduced	1
With	1
other	1
promises	1
and	1
other	1
vaunts	1
Than	1
to	1
submit,	1
boasting	1
I	1
could	1
subdue	1
The	1
Omnipotent.	1
Ay	1
me!	1
they	1
little	1
know	1
How	1
dearly	1
I	1
abide	1
that	1
boast	1
so	1
vain,	1
Under	1
what	1
torments	1
inwardly	1
I	1
groan,	1
While	1
they	1
adore	1
me	1
on	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
Hell.	1
With	1
diadem	1
and	1
scepter	1
high	1
advanced,	1
The	1
lower	1
still	1
I	1
fall,	1
only	1
supreme	1
In	1
misery:	1
Such	1
joy	1
ambition	1
finds.	1
But	1
say	1
I	1
could	1
repent,	1
and	1
could	1
obtain,	1
By	1
act	1
of	1
grace,	1
my	1
former	1
state;	1
how	1
soon	1
Would	1
highth	1
recall	1
high	1
thoughts,	1
how	1
soon	1
unsay	1
What	1
feigned	1
submission	1
swore?	1
Ease	1
would	1
recant	1
Vows	1
made	1
in	1
pain,	1
as	1
violent	1
and	1
void.	1
For	1
never	1
can	1
true	1
reconcilement	1
grow,	1
Where	1
wounds	1
of	1
deadly	1
hate	1
have	1
pierced	1
so	1
deep:	1
Which	1
would	1
but	1
lead	1
me	1
to	1
a	1
worse	1
relapse	1
And	1
heavier	1
fall:	1
so	1
should	1
I	1
purchase	1
dear	1
Short	1
intermission	1
bought	1
with	1
double	1
smart.	1
This	1
knows	1
my	1
Punisher;	1
therefore	1
as	1
far	1
From	1
granting	1
he,	1
as	1
I	1
from	1
begging,	1
peace;	1
All	1
hope	1
excluded	1
thus,	1
behold,	1
in	1
stead	1
Mankind	1
created,	1
and	1
for	1
him	1
this	1
world.	1
So	1
farewell,	1
hope;	1
and	1
with	1
hope	1
farewell,	1
fear;	1
Farewell,	1
remorse!	1
all	1
good	1
to	1
me	1
is	1
lost;	1
Evil,	1
be	1
thou	1
my	1
good;	1
by	1
thee	1
at	1
least	1
Divided	1
empire	1
with	1
Heaven's	1
King	1
I	1
hold,	1
By	1
thee,	1
and	1
more	1
than	1
half	1
perhaps	1
will	1
reign;	1
As	1
Man	1
ere	1
long,	1
and	1
this	1
new	1
world,	1
shall	1
know.	1
Thus	1
while	1
he	1
spake,	1
each	1
passion	1
dimmed	1
his	1
face	1
Thrice	1
changed	1
with	1
pale,	1
ire,	1
envy,	1
and	1
despair;	1
Which	1
marred	1
his	1
borrowed	1
visage,	1
and	1
betrayed	1
Him	1
counterfeit,	1
if	1
any	1
eye	1
beheld.	1
For	1
heavenly	1
minds	1
from	1
such	1
distempers	1
foul	1
Are	1
ever	1
clear.	1
Whereof	1
he	1
soon	1
aware,	1
Each	1
perturbation	1
smoothed	1
with	1
outward	1
calm,	1
Artificer	1
of	1
fraud;	1
and	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
That	1
practised	1
falsehood	1
under	1
saintly	1
show,	1
Deep	1
malice	1
to	1
conceal,	1
couched	1
with	1
revenge:	1
Yet	1
not	1
enough	1
had	1
practised	1
to	1
deceive	1
Uriel	1
once	1
warned;	1
whose	1
eye	1
pursued	1
him	1
down	1
The	1
way	1
he	1
went,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
Assyrian	1
mount	1
Saw	1
him	1
disfigured,	1
more	1
than	1
could	1
befall	1
Spirit	1
of	1
happy	1
sort;	1
his	1
gestures	1
fierce	1
He	1
marked	1
and	1
mad	1
demeanour,	1
then	1
alone,	1
As	1
he	1
supposed,	1
all	1
unobserved,	1
unseen.	1
So	1
on	1
he	1
fares,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
border	1
comes	1
Of	1
Eden,	1
where	1
delicious	1
Paradise,	1
Now	1
nearer,	1
crowns	1
with	1
her	1
enclosure	1
green,	1
As	1
with	1
a	1
rural	1
mound,	1
the	1
champaign	1
head	1
Of	1
a	1
steep	1
wilderness,	1
whose	1
hairy	1
sides	1
Access	1
denied;	1
and	1
overhead	1
upgrew	1
Insuperable	1
height	1
of	1
loftiest	1
shade,	1
Cedar,	1
and	1
pine,	1
and	1
fir,	1
and	1
branching	1
palm,	1
A	1
sylvan	1
scene,	1
and,	1
as	1
the	1
ranks	1
ascend,	1
Shade	1
above	1
shade,	1
a	1
woody	1
theatre	1
Of	1
stateliest	1
view.	1
Yet	1
higher	1
than	1
their	1
tops	1
The	1
verdurous	1
wall	1
of	1
Paradise	1
upsprung;	1
00081429	1
Which	1
to	1
our	1
general	1
sire	1
gave	1
prospect	1
large	1
Into	1
his	1
nether	1
empire	1
neighbouring	1
round.	1
And	1
higher	1
than	1
that	1
wall	1
a	1
circling	1
row	1
Of	1
goodliest	1
trees,	1
loaden	1
with	1
fairest	1
fruit,	1
Blossoms	1
and	1
fruits	1
at	1
once	1
of	1
golden	1
hue,	1
Appeared,	1
with	1
gay	1
enamelled	1
colours	1
mixed:	1
On	1
which	1
the	1
sun	1
more	1
glad	1
impressed	1
his	1
beams	1
Than	1
in	1
fair	1
evening	1
cloud,	1
or	1
humid	1
bow,	1
When	1
God	1
hath	1
showered	1
the	1
earth;	1
so	1
lovely	1
seemed	1
That	1
landskip:	1
And	1
of	1
pure	1
now	1
purer	1
air	1
Meets	1
his	1
approach,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
heart	1
inspires	1
Vernal	1
delight	1
and	1
joy,	1
able	1
to	1
drive	1
All	1
sadness	1
but	1
despair:	1
Now	1
gentle	1
gales,	1
Fanning	1
their	1
odoriferous	1
wings,	1
dispense	1
Native	1
perfumes,	1
and	1
whisper	1
whence	1
they	1
stole	1
Those	1
balmy	1
spoils.	1
As	1
when	1
to	1
them	1
who	1
fail	1
Beyond	1
the	1
Cape	1
of	1
Hope,	1
and	1
now	1
are	1
past	1
Mozambick,	1
off	1
at	1
sea	1
north-east	1
winds	1
blow	1
Sabean	1
odours	1
from	1
the	1
spicy	1
shore	1
Of	1
Araby	1
the	1
blest;	1
with	1
such	1
delay	1
Well	1
pleased	1
they	1
slack	1
their	1
course,	1
and	1
many	1
a	1
league	1
Cheered	1
with	1
the	1
grateful	1
smell	1
old	1
Ocean	1
smiles:	1
So	1
entertained	1
those	1
odorous	1
sweets	1
the	1
Fiend,	1
Who	1
came	1
their	1
bane;	1
though	1
with	1
them	1
better	1
pleased	1
Than	1
Asmodeus	1
with	1
the	1
fishy	1
fume	1
That	1
drove	1
him,	1
though	1
enamoured,	1
from	1
the	1
spouse	1
Of	1
Tobit's	1
son,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
vengeance	1
sent	1
From	1
Media	1
post	1
to	1
Egypt,	1
there	1
fast	1
bound.	1
Now	1
to	1
the	1
ascent	1
of	1
that	1
steep	1
savage	1
hill	1
Satan	1
had	1
journeyed	1
on,	1
pensive	1
and	1
slow;	1
But	1
further	1
way	1
found	1
none,	1
so	1
thick	1
entwined,	1
As	1
one	1
continued	1
brake,	1
the	1
undergrowth	1
Of	1
shrubs	1
and	1
tangling	1
bushes	1
had	1
perplexed	1
All	1
path	1
of	1
man	1
or	1
beast	1
that	1
passed	1
that	1
way.	1
One	1
gate	1
there	1
only	1
was,	1
and	1
that	1
looked	1
east	1
On	1
the	1
other	1
side:	1
which	1
when	1
the	1
arch-felon	1
saw,	1
Due	1
entrance	1
he	1
disdained;	1
and,	1
in	1
contempt,	1
At	1
one	1
flight	1
bound	1
high	1
over-leaped	1
all	1
bound	1
Of	1
hill	1
or	1
highest	1
wall,	1
and	1
sheer	1
within	1
Lights	1
on	1
his	1
feet.	1
As	1
when	1
a	1
prowling	1
wolf,	1
Whom	1
hunger	1
drives	1
to	1
seek	1
new	1
haunt	1
for	1
prey,	1
Watching	1
where	1
shepherds	1
pen	1
their	1
flocks	1
at	1
eve	1
In	1
hurdled	1
cotes	1
amid	1
the	1
field	1
secure,	1
Leaps	1
o'er	1
the	1
fence	1
with	1
ease	1
into	1
the	1
fold:	1
Or	1
as	1
a	1
thief,	1
bent	1
to	1
unhoard	1
the	1
cash	1
Of	1
some	1
rich	1
burgher,	1
whose	1
substantial	1
doors,	1
Cross-barred	1
and	1
bolted	1
fast,	1
fear	1
no	1
assault,	1
In	1
at	1
the	1
window	1
climbs,	1
or	1
o'er	1
the	1
tiles:	1
So	1
clomb	1
this	1
first	1
grand	1
thief	1
into	1
God's	1
fold;	1
So	1
since	1
into	1
his	1
church	1
lewd	1
hirelings	1
climb.	1
Thence	1
up	1
he	1
flew,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
tree	1
of	1
life,	1
The	1
middle	1
tree	1
and	1
highest	1
there	1
that	1
grew,	1
Sat	1
like	1
a	1
cormorant;	1
yet	1
not	1
true	1
life	1
Thereby	1
regained,	1
but	1
sat	1
devising	1
death	1
To	1
them	1
who	1
lived;	1
nor	1
on	1
the	1
virtue	1
thought	1
Of	1
that	1
life-giving	1
plant,	1
but	1
only	1
used	1
For	1
prospect,	1
what	1
well	1
used	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
pledge	1
Of	1
immortality.	1
So	1
little	1
knows	1
Any,	1
but	1
God	1
alone,	1
to	1
value	1
right	1
The	1
good	1
before	1
him,	1
but	1
perverts	1
best	1
things	1
To	1
worst	1
abuse,	1
or	1
to	1
their	1
meanest	1
use.	1
Beneath	1
him	1
with	1
new	1
wonder	1
now	1
he	1
views,	1
To	1
all	1
delight	1
of	1
human	1
sense	1
exposed,	1
In	1
narrow	1
room,	1
Nature's	1
whole	1
wealth,	1
yea	1
more,	1
A	1
Heaven	1
on	1
Earth:	1
For	1
blissful	1
Paradise	1
Of	1
God	1
the	1
garden	1
was,	1
by	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
east	1
Of	1
Eden	1
planted;	1
Eden	1
stretched	1
her	1
line	1
From	1
Auran	1
eastward	1
to	1
the	1
royal	1
towers	1
Of	1
great	1
Seleucia,	1
built	1
by	1
Grecian	1
kings,	1
Of	1
where	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Eden	1
long	1
before	1
Dwelt	1
in	1
Telassar:	1
In	1
this	1
pleasant	1
soil	1
His	1
far	1
more	1
pleasant	1
garden	1
God	1
ordained;	1
Out	1
of	1
the	1
fertile	1
ground	1
he	1
caused	1
to	1
grow	1
All	1
trees	1
of	1
noblest	1
kind	1
for	1
sight,	1
smell,	1
taste;	1
And	1
all	1
amid	1
them	1
stood	1
the	1
tree	1
of	1
life,	1
High	1
eminent,	1
blooming	1
ambrosial	1
fruit	1
Of	1
vegetable	1
gold;	1
and	1
next	1
to	1
life,	1
Our	1
death,	1
the	1
tree	1
of	1
knowledge,	1
grew	1
fast	1
by,	1
Knowledge	1
of	1
good	1
bought	1
dear	1
by	1
knowing	1
ill.	1
Southward	1
through	1
Eden	1
went	1
a	1
river	1
large,	1
Nor	1
changed	1
his	1
course,	1
but	1
through	1
the	1
shaggy	1
hill	1
Passed	1
underneath	1
ingulfed;	1
for	1
God	1
had	1
thrown	1
That	1
mountain	1
as	1
his	1
garden-mould	1
high	1
raised	1
Upon	1
the	1
rapid	1
current,	1
which,	1
through	1
veins	1
Of	1
porous	1
earth	1
with	1
kindly	1
thirst	1
up-drawn,	1
Rose	1
a	1
fresh	1
fountain,	1
and	1
with	1
many	1
a	1
rill	1
Watered	1
the	1
garden;	1
thence	1
united	1
fell	1
Down	1
the	1
steep	1
glade,	1
and	1
met	1
the	1
nether	1
flood,	1
Which	1
from	1
his	1
darksome	1
passage	1
now	1
appears,	1
And	1
now,	1
divided	1
into	1
four	1
main	1
streams,	1
Runs	1
diverse,	1
wandering	1
many	1
a	1
famous	1
realm	1
And	1
country,	1
whereof	1
here	1
needs	1
no	1
account;	1
But	1
rather	1
to	1
tell	1
how,	1
if	1
Art	1
could	1
tell,	1
How	1
from	1
that	1
sapphire	1
fount	1
the	1
crisped	1
brooks,	1
Rolling	1
on	1
orient	1
pearl	1
and	1
sands	1
of	1
gold,	1
With	1
mazy	1
errour	1
under	1
pendant	1
shades	1
Ran	1
nectar,	1
visiting	1
each	1
plant,	1
and	1
fed	1
Flowers	1
worthy	1
of	1
Paradise,	1
which	1
not	1
nice	1
Art	1
In	1
beds	1
and	1
curious	1
knots,	1
but	1
Nature	1
boon	1
Poured	1
forth	1
profuse	1
on	1
hill,	1
and	1
dale,	1
and	1
plain,	1
Both	1
where	1
the	1
morning	1
sun	1
first	1
warmly	1
smote	1
The	1
open	1
field,	1
and	1
where	1
the	1
unpierced	1
shade	1
Imbrowned	1
the	1
noontide	1
bowers:	1
Thus	1
was	1
this	1
place	1
A	1
happy	1
rural	1
seat	1
of	1
various	1
view;	1
Groves	1
whose	1
rich	1

Others	1
whose	1

Hung	1
amiable,	1
Hesperian	1

Of	1

Flowers	1

Of	1

Nilus'	1
head,	1
enclosed	1
with	1
shining	1
rock,	1
A	1
whole	1
day's	1
journey	1
high,	1
but	1
wide	1
remote	1
From	1
this	1
Assyrian	1
garden,	1
where	1
the	1
Fiend	1
Saw,	1
undelighted,	1
all	1
delight,	1
all	1
kind	1
Of	1
living	1
creatures,	1
new	1
to	1
sight,	1
and	1
strange	1
Two	1
of	1
far	1
nobler	1
shape,	1
erect	1
and	1
tall,	1
Godlike	1
erect,	1
with	1
native	1
honour	1
clad	1
In	1
naked	1
majesty	1
seemed	1
lords	1
of	1
all:	1
And	1
worthy	1
seemed;	1
for	1
in	1
their	1
looks	1
divine	1
The	1
image	1
of	1
their	1
glorious	1
Maker	1
shone,	1
Truth,	1
wisdom,	1
sanctitude	1
severe	1
and	1
pure,	1
(Severe,	1
but	1
in	1
true	1
filial	1
freedom	1
placed,)	1
Whence	1
true	1
authority	1
in	1
men;	1
though	1
both	1
Not	1
equal,	1
as	1
their	1
sex	1
not	1
equal	1
seemed;	1
For	1
contemplation	1
he	1
and	1
valour	1
formed;	1
For	1
softness	1
she	1
and	1
sweet	1
attractive	1
grace;	1
He	1
for	1
God	1
only,	1
she	1
for	1
God	1
in	1
him:	1
His	1
fair	1
large	1
front	1
and	1
eye	1
sublime	1
declared	1
Absolute	1
rule;	1
and	1
hyacinthine	1
locks	1
Round	1
from	1
his	1
parted	1
forelock	1
manly	1
hung	1
Clustering,	1
but	1
not	1
beneath	1
his	1
shoulders	1
broad:	1
She,	1
as	1
a	1
veil,	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
slender	1
waist	1
Her	1
unadorned	1
golden	1
tresses	1
wore	1
Dishevelled,	1
but	1
in	1
wanton	1
ringlets	1
waved	1
As	1
the	1
vine	1
curls	1
her	1
tendrils,	1
which	1
implied	1
Subjection,	1
but	1
required	1
with	1
gentle	1
sway,	1
And	1
by	1
her	1
yielded,	1
by	1
him	1
best	1
received,	1
Yielded	1
with	1
coy	1
submission,	1
modest	1
pride,	1
And	1
sweet,	1
reluctant,	1
amorous	1
delay.	1
Nor	1
those	1
mysterious	1
parts	1
were	1
then	1
concealed;	1
Then	1
was	1
not	1
guilty	1
shame,	1
dishonest	1
shame	1
Of	1
nature's	1
works,	1
honour	1
dishonourable,	1
Sin-bred,	1
how	1
have	1
ye	1
troubled	1
all	1
mankind	1
With	1
shows	1
instead,	1
mere	1
shows	1
of	1
seeming	1
pure,	1
And	1
banished	1
from	1
man's	1
life	1
his	1
happiest	1
life,	1
Simplicity	1
and	1
spotless	1
innocence!	1
So	1
passed	1
they	1
naked	1
on,	1
nor	1
shunned	1
the	1
sight	1
Of	1
God	1
or	1
Angel;	1
for	1
they	1
thought	1
no	1
ill:	1
So	1
hand	1
in	1
hand	1
they	1
passed,	1
the	1
loveliest	1
pair,	1
That	1
ever	1
since	1
in	1
love's	1
embraces	1
met;	1
Adam	1
the	1
goodliest	1
man	1
of	1
men	1
since	1
born	1
His	1
sons,	1
the	1
fairest	1
of	1
her	1
daughters	1
Eve.	1
Under	1
a	1
tuft	1
of	1
shade	1
that	1
on	1
a	1
green	1
Stood	1
whispering	1
soft,	1
by	1
a	1
fresh	1
fountain	1
side	1
They	1
sat	1
them	1
down;	1
and,	1
after	1
no	1
more	1
toil	1
Of	1
their	1
sweet	1
gardening	1
labour	1
than	1
sufficed	1
To	1
recommend	1
cool	1
Zephyr,	1
and	1
made	1
ease	1
More	1
easy,	1
wholesome	1
thirst	1
and	1
appetite	1
More	1
grateful,	1
to	1
their	1
supper-fruits	1
they	1
fell,	1
Nectarine	1
fruits	1
which	1
the	1
compliant	1
boughs	1
Yielded	1
them,	1
side-long	1
as	1
they	1
sat	1
recline	1
On	1
the	1
soft	1
downy	1
bank	1
damasked	1
with	1
flowers:	1
The	1
savoury	1
pulp	1
they	1
chew,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
rind,	1
Still	1
as	1
they	1
thirsted,	1
scoop	1
the	1
brimming	1
stream;	1
Nor	1
gentle	1
purpose,	1
nor	1
endearing	1
smiles	1
Wanted,	1
nor	1
youthful	1
dalliance,	1
as	1
beseems	1
Fair	1
couple,	1
linked	1
in	1
happy	1

Alone	1
as	1
they.	1
About	1

All	1

In	1

Sporting	1
the	1

the	1

Gambolled	1
before	1

the	1

To	1
make	1
them	1

Couched,	1
and	1
now	1
filled	1
with	1

sat,	1
Or	1

for	1
the	1

Declined,	1
was	1
hasting	1
now	1
with	1
prone	1

To	1
the	1

and	1
in	1
the	1
ascending	1

Of	1
Heaven	1
the	1

that	1
usher	1
evening	1
rose:	1
When	1
Satan	1
still	1
in	1
gaze,	1
as	1
first	1
he	1
stood,	1
Scarce	1
thus	1
at	1
length	1
failed	1
speech	1
recovered	1
sad.	1
O	1
Hell!	1
what	1
do	1
mine	1
eyes	1
with	1
grief	1
behold!	1
Into	1
our	1
room	1
of	1
bliss	1
thus	1
high	1
advanced	1
Creatures	1
of	1
other	1
mould,	1
earth-born	1
perhaps,	1
Not	1
Spirits,	1
yet	1
to	1
heavenly	1
Spirits	1
bright	1
Little	1
inferiour;	1
whom	1
my	1
thoughts	1
pursue	1
With	1
wonder,	1
and	1
could	1
love,	1
so	1
lively	1
shines	1
In	1
them	1
divine	1
resemblance,	1
and	1
such	1
grace	1
The	1
hand	1
that	1
formed	1
them	1
on	1
their	1
shape	1
hath	1
poured.	1
Ah!	1
gentle	1
pair,	1
ye	1
little	1
think	1
how	1
nigh	1
Your	1
change	1
approaches,	1
when	1
all	1
these	1
delights	1
Will	1
vanish,	1
and	1
deliver	1
ye	1
to	1
woe;	1
More	1
woe,	1
the	1
more	1
your	1
taste	1
is	1
now	1
of	1
joy;	1
Happy,	1
but	1
for	1
so	1
happy	1
ill	1
secured	1
Long	1
to	1
continue,	1
and	1
this	1
high	1
seat	1
your	1
Heaven	1
Ill	1
fenced	1
for	1
Heaven	1
to	1
keep	1
out	1
such	1
a	1
foe	1
As	1
now	1
is	1
entered;	1
yet	1
no	1
purposed	1
foe	1
To	1
you,	1
whom	1
I	1
could	1
pity	1
thus	1
forlorn,	1
Though	1
I	1
unpitied:	1
League	1
with	1
you	1
I	1
seek,	1
And	1
mutual	1
amity,	1
so	1
strait,	1
so	1
close,	1
That	1
I	1
with	1
you	1
must	1
dwell,	1
or	1
you	1
with	1
me	1
Henceforth;	1
my	1
dwelling	1
haply	1
may	1
not	1
please,	1
Like	1
this	1
fair	1
Paradise,	1
your	1
sense;	1
yet	1
such	1
Accept	1
your	1
Maker's	1
work;	1
he	1
gave	1
it	1
me,	1
Which	1
I	1
as	1
freely	1
give:	1
Hell	1
shall	1
unfold,	1
To	1
entertain	1
you	1
two,	1
her	1
widest	1
gates,	1
And	1
send	1
forth	1
all	1
her	1
kings;	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
room,	1
Not	1
like	1
these	1
narrow	1
limits,	1
to	1
receive	1
Your	1
numerous	1
offspring;	1
if	1
no	1
better	1
place,	1
Thank	1
him	1
who	1
puts	1
me	1
loth	1
to	1
this	1
revenge	1
On	1
you	1
who	1
wrong	1
me	1
not	1
for	1
him	1
who	1
wronged.	1
And	1
should	1
I	1
at	1
your	1
harmless	1
innocence	1
Melt,	1
as	1
I	1
do,	1
yet	1
publick	1
reason	1
just,	1
Honour	1
and	1
empire	1
with	1
revenge	1
enlarged,	1
By	1
conquering	1
this	1
new	1
world,	1
compels	1
me	1
now	1
To	1
do	1
what	1
else,	1
though	1
damned,	1
I	1
should	1
abhor.	1
So	1
spake	1
the	1
Fiend,	1
and	1
with	1
necessity,	1
The	1
tyrant's	1
plea,	1
excused	1
his	1
devilish	1
deeds.	1
Then	1
from	1
his	1
lofty	1
stand	1
on	1
that	1
high	1
tree	1
Down	1
he	1
alights	1
among	1
the	1
sportful	1
herd	1
Of	1
those	1
four-footed	1
kinds,	1
himself	1
now	1
one,	1
Now	1
other,	1
as	1
their	1
shape	1
served	1
best	1
his	1
end	1
Nearer	1
to	1
view	1
his	1
prey,	1
and,	1
unespied,	1
To	1
mark	1
what	1
of	1
their	1
state	1
he	1
more	1
might	1
learn,	1
By	1
word	1
or	1
action	1
marked.	1
About	1
them	1
round	1
A	1
lion	1
now	1
he	1
stalks	1
with	1
fiery	1
glare;	1
Then	1
as	1
a	1
tiger,	1
who	1
by	1
chance	1
hath	1
spied	1
In	1
some	1
purlieu	1
two	1
gentle	1
fawns	1
at	1
play,	1
Straight	1
couches	1
close,	1
then,	1
rising,	1
changes	1
oft	1
His	1
couchant	1
watch,	1
as	1
one	1
who	1
chose	1
his	1
ground,	1
Whence	1
rushing,	1
he	1
might	1
surest	1
seize	1
them	1
both,	1
Griped	1
in	1
each	1
paw:	1
when,	1
Adam	1
first	1
of	1
men	1
To	1
first	1
of	1
women	1
Eve	1
thus	1
moving	1
speech,	1
Turned	1
him,	1
all	1
ear	1
to	1
hear	1
new	1
utterance	1
flow.	1
Sole	1
partner,	1
and	1
sole	1
part,	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
joys,	1
Dearer	1
thyself	1
than	1
all;	1
needs	1
must	1
the	1
Power	1
That	1
made	1
us,	1
and	1
for	1
us	1
this	1
ample	1
world,	1
Be	1
infinitely	1
good,	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
good	1
As	1
liberal	1
and	1
free	1
as	1
infinite;	1
That	1
raised	1
us	1
from	1
the	1
dust,	1
and	1
placed	1
us	1
here	1
In	1
all	1
this	1
happiness,	1
who	1
at	1
his	1
hand	1
Have	1
nothing	1
merited,	1
nor	1
can	1
perform	1
Aught	1
whereof	1
he	1
hath	1
need;	1
he	1
who	1
requires	1
From	1
us	1
no	1
other	1
service	1
than	1
to	1
keep	1
This	1
one,	1
this	1
easy	1
charge,	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
trees	1
In	1
Paradise	1
that	1
bear	1
delicious	1
fruit	1
So	1
various,	1
not	1
to	1
taste	1
that	1
only	1
tree	1
Of	1
knowledge,	1
planted	1
by	1
the	1
tree	1
of	1
life;	1
So	1
near	1
grows	1
death	1
to	1
life,	1
whate'er	1
death	1
is,	1
Some	1
dreadful	1
thing	1
no	1
doubt;	1
for	1
well	1
thou	1
knowest	1
God	1
hath	1
pronounced	1
it	1
death	1
to	1
taste	1
that	1
tree,	1
The	1
only	1
sign	1
of	1
our	1
obedience	1
left,	1
Among	1
so	1
many	1
signs	1
of	1
power	1
and	1
rule	1
Conferred	1
upon	1
us,	1
and	1
dominion	1
given	1
Over	1
all	1
other	1
creatures	1
that	1
possess	1
Earth,	1
air,	1
and	1
sea.	1
Then	1
let	1
us	1
not	1
think	1
hard	1
One	1
easy	1
prohibition,	1
who	1
enjoy	1
Free	1
leave	1
so	1
large	1
to	1
all	1
things	1
else,	1
and	1
choice	1
Unlimited	1
of	1
manifold	1
delights:	1
But	1
let	1
us	1
ever	1
praise	1
him,	1
and	1
extol	1
His	1
bounty,	1
following	1
our	1
delightful	1
task,	1
To	1
prune	1
these	1
growing	1
plants,	1
and	1
tend	1
these	1
flowers,	1
Which	1
were	1
it	1
toilsome,	1
yet	1
with	1
thee	1
were	1
sweet.	1
To	1
whom	1
thus	1
Eve	1
replied.	1
O	1
thou	1
for	1
whom	1
And	1
from	1
whom	1
I	1
was	1
formed,	1
flesh	1
of	1
thy	1
flesh,	1
And	1
without	1
whom	1
am	1
to	1
no	1
end,	1
my	1
guide	1
And	1
head!	1
what	1
thou	1
hast	1
said	1
is	1
just	1
and	1
right.	1
For	1
we	1
to	1
him	1
indeed	1
all	1
praises	1
owe,	1
And	1
daily	1
thanks;	1
I	1
chiefly,	1
who	1
enjoy	1
So	1
far	1
the	1
happier	1
lot,	1
enjoying	1
thee	1
Pre-eminent	1
by	1
so	1
much	1
odds,	1
while	1
thou	1
Like	1
consort	1
to	1
thyself	1
canst	1
no	1
where	1
find.	1
That	1
day	1
I	1
oft	1
remember,	1
when	1
from	1
sleep	1
I	1
first	1
awaked,	1
and	1
found	1
myself	1
reposed	1
Under	1
a	1
shade	1
on	1
flowers,	1
much	1
wondering	1
where	1
And	1
what	1
I	1
was,	1
whence	1
thither	1
brought,	1
and	1
how.	1
Not	1
distant	1
far	1
from	1
thence	1
a	1
murmuring	1
sound	1
Of	1
waters	1
issued	1
from	1
a	1
cave,	1
and	1
spread	1
Into	1
a	1
liquid	1
plain,	1
then	1
stood	1
unmoved	1
Pure	1
as	1
the	1
expanse	1
of	1
Heaven;	1
I	1
thither	1
went	1
With	1
unexperienced	1
thought,	1
and	1
laid	1
me	1
down	1
On	1
the	1
green	1
bank,	1
to	1
look	1
into	1
the	1
clear	1
Smooth	1
lake,	1
that	1
to	1
me	1
seemed	1
another	1
sky.	1
As	1
I	1
bent	1
down	1
to	1
look,	1
just	1
opposite	1
A	1
shape	1
within	1
the	1
watery	1
gleam	1
appeared,	1
Bending	1
to	1
look	1
on	1
me:	1
I	1
started	1
back,	1
It	1
started	1
back;	1
but	1
pleased	1
I	1
soon	1
returned,	1
Pleased	1
it	1
returned	1
as	1
soon	1
with	1
answering	1
looks	1
Of	1
sympathy	1
and	1
love:	1
There	1
I	1
had	1
fixed	1
Mine	1
eyes	1
till	1
now,	1
and	1
pined	1
with	1
vain	1
desire,	1
Had	1
not	1
a	1
voice	1
thus	1
warned	1
me;	1
'What	1
thou	1
seest,	1
'What	1
there	1
thou	1
seest,	1
fair	1
Creature,	1
is	1
thyself;	1
'With	1
thee	1
it	1
came	1
and	1
goes:	1
but	1
follow	1
me,	1
'And	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
thee	1
where	1
no	1
shadow	1
stays	1
'Thy	1
coming,	1
and	1
thy	1
soft	1
embraces,	1
he	1
'Whose	1
image	1
thou	1
art;	1
him	1
thou	1
shalt	1
enjoy	1
'Inseparably	1
thine,	1
to	1
him	1
shalt	1
bear	1
'Multitudes	1
like	1
thyself,	1
and	1
thence	1
be	1
called	1
'Mother	1
of	1
human	1
race.'	1
What	1
could	1
I	1
do,	1
But	1
follow	1
straight,	1
invisibly	1
thus	1
led?	1
Till	1
I	1
espied	1
thee,	1
fair	1
indeed	1
and	1
tall,	1
Under	1
a	1
platane;	1
yet	1
methought	1
less	1
fair,	1
Less	1
winning	1
soft,	1
less	1
amiably	1
mild,	1
Than	1
that	1
smooth	1
watery	1
image:	1
Back	1
I	1
turned;	1
Thou	1
following	1
cryedst	1
aloud,	1
'Return,	1
fair	1
Eve;	1
'Whom	1
flyest	1
thou?	1
whom	1
thou	1
flyest,	1
of	1
him	1
thou	1
art,	1
'His	1
flesh,	1
his	1
bone;	1
to	1
give	1
thee	1
being	1
I	1

'Out	1

my	1

my	1

'Substantial	1
life,	1

my	1

'Henceforth	1

'Part	1
of	1
my	1

I	1

and	1
thee	1
claim	1
'My	1
other	1
half:'	1
With	1
that	1
thy	1
gentle	1
hand	1
Seised	1
mine:	1
I	1
yielded;and	1
from	1
that	1
time	1
see	1
How	1
beauty	1
is	1
excelled	1
by	1
manly	1
grace,	1
And	1
wisdom,	1
which	1
alone	1
is	1
truly	1
fair.	1
So	1
spake	1
our	1
general	1
mother,	1
and	1
with	1
eyes	1
Of	1
conjugal	1
attraction	1
unreproved,	1
And	1
meek	1
surrender,	1
half-embracing	1
leaned	1
On	1
our	1
first	1
father;	1
half	1
her	1
swelling	1
breast	1
Naked	1
met	1
his,	1
under	1
the	1
flowing	1
gold	1
Of	1
her	1
loose	1
tresses	1
hid:	1
he	1
in	1
delight	1
Both	1
of	1
her	1
beauty,	1
and	1
submissive	1
charms,	1
Smiled	1
with	1
superiour	1
love,	1
as	1
Jupiter	1
On	1
Juno	1
smiles,	1
when	1
he	1
impregns	1
the	1
clouds	1
That	1
shed	1
Mayflowers;	1
and	1
pressed	1
her	1
matron	1
lip	1
With	1
kisses	1
pure:	1
Aside	1
the	1
Devil	1
turned	1
For	1
envy;	1
yet	1
with	1
jealous	1
leer	1
malign	1
Eyed	1
them	1
askance,	1
and	1
to	1
himself	1
thus	1
plained.	1
Sight	1
hateful,	1
sight	1
tormenting!	1
thus	1
these	1
two,	1
Imparadised	1
in	1
one	1
another's	1
arms,	1
The	1
happier	1
Eden,	1
shall	1
enjoy	1
their	1
fill	1
Of	1
bliss	1
on	1
bliss;	1
while	1
I	1
to	1
Hell	1
am	1
thrust,	1
Where	1
neither	1
joy	1
nor	1
love,	1
but	1
fierce	1
desire,	1
Among	1
our	1
other	1
torments	1
not	1
the	1
least,	1
Still	1
unfulfilled	1
with	1
pain	1
of	1
longing	1
pines.	1
Yet	1
let	1
me	1
not	1
forget	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
gained	1
From	1
their	1
own	1
mouths:	1
All	1
is	1
not	1
theirs,	1
it	1
seems;	1
One	1
fatal	1
tree	1
there	1
stands,	1
of	1
knowledge	1
called,	1
Forbidden	1
them	1
to	1
taste:	1
Knowledge	1
forbidden	1
Suspicious,	1
reasonless.	1
Why	1
should	1
their	1
Lord	1
Envy	1
them	1
that?	1
Can	1
it	1
be	1
sin	1
to	1
know?	1
Can	1
it	1
be	1
death?	1
And	1
do	1
they	1
only	1
stand	1
By	1
ignorance?	1
Is	1
that	1
their	1
happy	1
state,	1
The	1
proof	1
of	1
their	1
obedience	1
and	1
their	1
faith?	1
O	1
fair	1
foundation	1
laid	1
whereon	1
to	1
build	1
Their	1
ruin!	1
hence	1
I	1
will	1
excite	1
their	1
minds	1
With	1
more	1
desire	1
to	1
know,	1
and	1
to	1
reject	1
Envious	1
commands,	1
invented	1
with	1
design	1
To	1
keep	1
them	1
low,	1
whom	1
knowledge	1
might	1
exalt	1
Equal	1
with	1
Gods:	1
aspiring	1
to	1
be	1
such,	1
They	1
taste	1
and	1
die:	1
What	1
likelier	1
can	1
ensue	1
But	1
first	1
with	1
narrow	1
search	1
I	1
must	1
walk	1
round	1
This	1
garden,	1
and	1
no	1
corner	1
leave	1
unspied;	1
A	1
chance	1
but	1
chance	1
may	1
lead	1
where	1
I	1
may	1
meet	1
Some	1
wandering	1
Spirit	1
of	1
Heaven	1
by	1
fountain	1
side,	1
Or	1
in	1
thick	1
shade	1
retired,	1
from	1
him	1
to	1
draw	1
What	1
further	1
would	1
be	1
learned.	1
Live	1
while	1
ye	1
may,	1
Yet	1
happy	1
pair;	1
enjoy,	1
till	1
I	1
return,	1
Short	1
pleasures,	1
for	1
long	1
woes	1
are	1
to	1
succeed!	1
So	1
saying,	1
his	1
proud	1
step	1
he	1
scornful	1
turned,	1
But	1
with	1
sly	1
circumspection,	1
and	1
began	1
Through	1
wood,	1
through	1
waste,	1
o'er	1
hill,	1
o'er	1
dale,	1
his	1
roam	1
Mean	1
while	1
in	1
utmost	1
longitude,	1
where	1
Heaven	1
With	1
earth	1
and	1
ocean	1
meets,	1
the	1
setting	1
sun	1
Slowly	1
descended,	1
and	1
with	1
right	1
aspect	1
Against	1
the	1
eastern	1
gate	1
of	1
Paradise	1
Levelled	1
his	1
evening	1
rays:	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
rock	1
Of	1
alabaster,	1
piled	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
clouds,	1
Conspicuous	1
far,	1
winding	1
with	1
one	1
ascent	1
Accessible	1
from	1
earth,	1
one	1
entrance	1
high;	1
The	1
rest	1
was	1
craggy	1
cliff,	1
that	1
overhung	1
Still	1
as	1
it	1
rose,	1
impossible	1
to	1
climb.	1
Betwixt	1
these	1
rocky	1
pillars	1
Gabriel	1
sat,	1
Chief	1
of	1
the	1
angelick	1
guards,	1
awaiting	1
night;	1
About	1
him	1
exercised	1
heroick	1
games	1
The	1
unarmed	1
youth	1
of	1
Heaven,	1
but	1
nigh	1
at	1
hand	1
Celestial	1
armoury,	1
shields,	1
helms,	1
and	1
spears,	1
Hung	1
high	1
with	1
diamond	1
flaming,	1
and	1
with	1
gold.	1
Thither	1
came	1
Uriel,	1
gliding	1
through	1
the	1
even	1
On	1
a	1
sun-beam,	1
swift	1
as	1
a	1
shooting	1
star	1
In	1
autumn	1
thwarts	1
the	1
night,	1
when	1
vapours	1
fired	1
Impress	1
the	1
air,	1
and	1
shows	1
the	1
mariner	1
From	1
what	1
point	1
of	1
his	1
compass	1
to	1
beware	1
Impetuous	1
winds:	1
He	1
thus	1
began	1
in	1
haste.	1
Gabriel,	1
to	1
thee	1
thy	1
course	1
by	1
lot	1
hath	1
given	1
Charge	1
and	1
strict	1
watch,	1
that	1
to	1
this	1
happy	1
place	1
No	1
evil	1
thing	1
approach	1
or	1
enter	1
in.	1
This	1
day	1
at	1
highth	1
of	1
noon	1
came	1
to	1
my	1
sphere	1
A	1
Spirit,	1
zealous,	1
as	1
he	1
seemed,	1
to	1
know	1
More	1
of	1
the	1
Almighty's	1
works,	1
and	1
chiefly	1
Man,	1
God's	1
latest	1
image:	1
I	1
described	1
his	1
way	1
Bent	1
all	1
on	1
speed,	1
and	1
marked	1
his	1
aery	1
gait;	1
But	1
in	1
the	1
mount	1
that	1
lies	1
from	1
Eden	1
north,	1
Where	1
he	1
first	1
lighted,	1
soon	1
discerned	1
his	1
looks	1
Alien	1
from	1
Heaven,	1
with	1
passions	1
foul	1
obscured:	1
Mine	1
eye	1
pursued	1
him	1
still,	1
but	1
under	1
shade	1
Lost	1
sight	1
of	1
him:	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
banished	1
crew,	1
I	1
fear,	1
hath	1
ventured	1
from	1
the	1
deep,	1
to	1
raise	1
New	1
troubles;	1
him	1
thy	1
care	1
must	1
be	1
to	1
find.	1
To	1
whom	1
the	1
winged	1
warriour	1
thus	1
returned.	1
Uriel,	1
no	1
wonder	1
if	1
thy	1
perfect	1
sight,	1
Amid	1
the	1
sun's	1
bright	1
circle	1
where	1
thou	1
sitst,	1
See	1
far	1
and	1
wide:	1
In	1
at	1
this	1
gate	1
none	1
pass	1
The	1
vigilance	1
here	1
placed,	1
but	1
such	1
as	1
come	1
Well	1
known	1
from	1
Heaven;	1
and	1
since	1
meridian	1
hour	1
No	1
creature	1
thence:	1
If	1
Spirit	1
of	1
other	1
sort,	1
So	1
minded,	1
have	1
o'er-leaped	1
these	1
earthly	1
bounds	1
On	1
purpose,	1
hard	1
thou	1
knowest	1
it	1
to	1
exclude	1
Spiritual	1
substance	1
with	1
corporeal	1
bar.	1
But	1
if	1
within	1
the	1
circuit	1
of	1
these	1
walks,	1
In	1
whatsoever	1
shape	1
he	1
lurk,	1
of	1
whom	1
Thou	1
tellest,	1
by	1
morrow	1
dawning	1
I	1
shall	1
know.	1
So	1
promised	1
he;	1
and	1
Uriel	1
to	1
his	1
charge	1
Returned	1
on	1
that	1
bright	1
beam,	1
whose	1
point	1
now	1
raised	1
Bore	1
him	1
slope	1
downward	1
to	1
the	1
sun	1
now	1
fallen	1
Beneath	1
the	1
Azores;	1
whether	1
the	1
prime	1
orb,	1
Incredible	1
how	1
swift,	1
had	1
thither	1
rolled	1
Diurnal,	1
or	1
this	1
less	1
volubil	1
earth,	1
By	1
shorter	1
flight	1
to	1
the	1
east,	1
had	1
left	1
him	1
there	1
Arraying	1
with	1
reflected	1
purple	1
and	1
gold	1
The	1
clouds	1
that	1
on	1
his	1
western	1
throne	1
attend.	1
Now	1
came	1
still	1
Evening	1
on,	1
and	1
Twilight	1
gray	1
Had	1
in	1
her	1
sober	1
livery	1
all	1
things	1
clad;	1
Silence	1
accompanied;	1
for	1
beast	1
and	1
bird,	1
They	1
to	1
their	1
grassy	1
couch,	1
these	1
to	1
their	1
nests	1
Were	1
slunk,	1
all	1
but	1
the	1
wakeful	1
nightingale;	1
She	1
all	1
night	1
long	1
her	1
amorous	1
descant	1
sung;	1
Silence	1
was	1
pleased:	1
Now	1
glowed	1
the	1
firmament	1
With	1
living	1
sapphires:	1
Hesperus,	1
that	1
led	1
The	1
starry	1
host,	1
rode	1
brightest,	1
till	1
the	1
moon,	1
Rising	1
in	1
clouded	1
majesty,	1
at	1
length	1
Apparent	1
queen	1
unveiled	1
her	1
peerless	1
light,	1
And	1
o'er	1
the	1
dark	1
her	1
silver	1
mantle	1
threw.	1
When	1
Adam	1
thus	1
to	1
Eve.	1
Fair	1
Consort,	1
the	1
hour	1
Of	1
night,	1
and	1
all	1
things	1
now	1
retired	1
to	1
rest,	1
Mind	1
us	1
of	1
like	1
repose;	1
since	1
God	1
hath	1
set	1
Labour	1
and	1
rest,	1
as	1
day	1
and	1
night,	1
to	1
men	1
Successive;	1
and	1
the	1
timely	1
dew	1
of	1
sleep,	1
Now	1
falling	1
with	1
soft	1
slumbrous	1
weight,	1
inclines	1
Our	1
eye-lids:	1
Other	1
creatures	1
all	1
day	1
long	1
Rove	1
idle,	1
unemployed,	1
and	1
less	1
need	1
rest;	1
Man	1
hath	1
his	1
daily	1
work	1
of	1
body	1
or	1
mind	1
Appointed,	1
which	1
declares	1
his	1
dignity,	1
And	1
the	1
regard	1
of	1
Heaven	1
on	1
all	1
his	1
ways;	1
While	1
other	1
animals	1
unactive	1
range,	1
And	1
of	1
their	1
doings	1
God	1
takes	1
no	1
account.	1
To-morrow,	1
ere	1
fresh	1
morning	1
streak	1
the	1
east	1
With	1
first	1
approach	1
of	1
light,	1
we	1
must	1
be	1
risen,	1
And	1
at	1
our	1
pleasant	1
labour,	1
to	1
reform	1
Yon	1
flowery	1
arbours,	1
yonder	1
alleys	1
green,	1
Our	1
walk	1
at	1
noon,	1
with	1
branches	1
overgrown,	1
That	1
mock	1
our	1
scant	1
manuring,	1
and	1
require	1
More	1
hands	1
than	1
ours	1
to	1
lop	1
their	1
wanton	1
growth:	1
Those	1
blossoms	1
also,	1
and	1
those	1
dropping	1
gums,	1
That	1
lie	1
bestrown,	1
unsightly	1
and	1
unsmooth,	1
Ask	1
riddance,	1
if	1
we	1
mean	1
to	1
tread	1
with	1
ease;	1
Mean	1
while,	1
as	1
Nature	1
wills,	1
night	1
bids	1
us	1
rest.	1
To	1
whom	1
thus	1
Eve,	1
with	1
perfect	1
beauty	1
adorned	1
My	1
Author	1
and	1
Disposer,	1
what	1
thou	1
bidst	1
Unargued	1
I	1
obey:	1
So	1
God	1
ordains;	1
God	1
is	1
thy	1
law,	1
thou	1
mine:	1
To	1
know	1
no	1
more	1
Is	1
woman's	1
happiest	1
knowledge,	1
and	1
her	1
praise.	1
With	1
thee	1
conversing	1
I	1
forget	1
all	1
time;	1
All	1
seasons,	1
and	1
their	1
change,	1
all	1
please	1
alike.	1
Sweet	1
is	1
the	1
breath	1
of	1
Morn,	1
her	1
rising	1
sweet,	1
With	1
charm	1
of	1
earliest	1
birds:	1
pleasant	1
the	1
sun,	1
When	1
first	1
on	1
this	1
delightful	1
land	1
he	1
spreads	1
His	1
orient	1
beams,	1
on	1
herb,	1
tree,	1
fruit,	1
and	1
flower,	1
Glistering	1
with	1
dew;	1
fragrant	1
the	1
fertile	1
earth	1
After	1
soft	1
showers;	1
and	1
sweet	1
the	1
coming	1
on	1
Of	1
grateful	1
Evening	1
mild;	1
then	1
silent	1
Night,	1
With	1
this	1
her	1
solemn	1
bird,	1
and	1
this	1
fair	1
moon,	1
And	1
these	1
the	1
gems	1
of	1
Heaven,	1
her	1
starry	1
train:	1
But	1
neither	1
breath	1
of	1
Morn,	1
when	1
she	1
ascends	1
With	1
charm	1
of	1
earliest	1
birds;	1
nor	1
rising	1
sun	1
On	1
this	1
delightful	1
land;	1
nor	1
herb,	1
fruit,	1
flower,	1
Glistering	1
with	1
dew;	1
nor	1
fragrance	1
after	1
showers;	1
Nor	1
grateful	1
Evening	1
mild;	1
nor	1
silent	1
Night,	1
With	1
this	1
her	1
solemn	1
bird,	1
nor	1
walk	1
by	1
moon,	1
Or	1
glittering	1
star-light,	1
without	1
thee	1
is	1
sweet.	1
But	1
wherefore	1
all	1
night	1
long	1
shine	1
these?	1
for	1
whom	1
This	1
glorious	1
sight,	1
when	1
sleep	1
hath	1
shut	1
all	1
eyes?	1
To	1
whom	1
our	1
general	1
ancestor	1
replied.	1
Daughter	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
Man,	1
accomplished	1
Eve,	1
These	1
have	1
their	1
course	1
to	1
finish	1
round	1
the	1
earth,	1
By	1
morrow	1
evening,	1
and	1
from	1
land	1
to	1
land	1
In	1
order,	1
though	1
to	1
nations	1
yet	1
unborn,	1
Ministring	1
light	1
prepared,	1
they	1
set	1
and	1
rise;	1
Lest	1
total	1
Darkness	1
should	1
by	1
night	1
regain	1
Her	1
old	1
possession,	1
and	1
extinguish	1
life	1
In	1
Nature	1
and	1
all	1
things;	1
which	1
these	1
soft	1
fires	1
Not	1
only	1
enlighten,	1
but	1
with	1
kindly	1
heat	1
Of	1
various	1
influence	1
foment	1
and	1
warm,	1
Temper	1
or	1
nourish,	1
or	1
in	1
part	1
shed	1
down	1
Their	1
stellar	1
virtue	1
on	1
all	1
kinds	1
that	1
grow	1
On	1
earth,	1
made	1
hereby	1
apter	1
to	1
receive	1
Perfection	1
from	1
the	1
sun's	1
more	1
potent	1
ray.	1
These	1
then,	1
though	1
unbeheld	1
in	1
deep	1
of	1
night,	1
Shine	1
not	1
in	1
vain;	1
nor	1
think,	1
though	1
men	1
were	1
none,	1
That	1
Heaven	1
would	1
want	1
spectators,	1
God	1
want	1
praise:	1
Millions	1
of	1
spiritual	1
creatures	1
walk	1
the	1
earth	1
Unseen,	1
both	1
when	1
we	1
wake,	1
and	1
when	1
we	1
sleep:	1
All	1
these	1
with	1
ceaseless	1
praise	1
his	1
works	1
behold	1
Both	1
day	1
and	1
night:	1
How	1
often	1
from	1
the	1
steep	1
Of	1
echoing	1
hill	1
or	1
thicket	1
have	1
we	1
heard	1
Celestial	1
voices	1
to	1
the	1
midnight	1
air,	1
Sole,	1
or	1
responsive	1
each	1
to	1
others	1
note,	1
Singing	1
their	1
great	1
Creator?	1
oft	1
in	1
bands	1
While	1
they	1
keep	1
watch,	1
or	1
nightly	1
rounding	1
walk,	1
With	1
heavenly	1
touch	1
of	1
instrumental	1
sounds	1
In	1
full	1
harmonick	1
number	1
joined,	1
their	1
songs	1
Divide	1
the	1
night,	1
and	1
lift	1
our	1
thoughts	1
to	1
Heaven.	1
Thus	1
talking,	1
hand	1
in	1
hand	1
alone	1
they	1
passed	1
On	1
to	1
their	1
blissful	1
bower:	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
place	1
Chosen	1
by	1
the	1
sovran	1
Planter,	1
when	1
he	1
framed	1
All	1
things	1
to	1
Man's	1
delightful	1
use;	1
the	1
roof	1
Of	1
thickest	1
covert	1
was	1
inwoven	1
shade	1
Laurel	1
and	1
myrtle,	1
and	1
what	1
higher	1
grew	1
Of	1
firm	1
and	1
fragrant	1
leaf;	1
on	1
either	1
side	1
Acanthus,	1
and	1
each	1
odorous	1
bushy	1
shrub,	1
Fenced	1
up	1
the	1
verdant	1
wall;	1
each	1
beauteous	1
flower,	1
Iris	1
all	1
hues,	1
roses,	1
and	1
jessamin,	1
Reared	1
high	1
their	1
flourished	1
heads	1
between,	1
and	1
wrought	1
Mosaick;	1
underfoot	1
the	1
violet,	1
Crocus,	1
and	1
hyacinth,	1
with	1
rich	1
inlay	1
Broidered	1
the	1
ground,	1
more	1
coloured	1
than	1
with	1
stone	1
Of	1
costliest	1
emblem:	1
Other	1
creature	1
here,	1
Bird,	1
beast,	1
insect,	1
or	1
worm,	1
durst	1
enter	1
none,	1
Such	1
was	1
their	1
awe	1
of	1
Man.	1
In	1
shadier	1
bower	1
More	1
sacred	1
and	1
sequestered,	1
though	1
but	1
feigned,	1
Pan	1
or	1
Sylvanus	1
never	1
slept,	1
nor	1
Nymph	1
Nor	1
Faunus	1
haunted.	1
Here,	1
in	1
close	1
recess,	1
With	1
flowers,	1
garlands,	1
and	1
sweet-smelling	1
herbs,	1
Espoused	1
Eve	1
decked	1
first	1
her	1
nuptial	1
bed;	1
And	1
heavenly	1
quires	1
the	1
hymenaean	1
sung,	1
What	1
day	1
the	1
genial	1
Angel	1
to	1
our	1
sire	1
Brought	1
her	1
in	1
naked	1
beauty	1
more	1
adorned,	1
More	1
lovely,	1
than	1
Pandora,	1
whom	1
the	1
Gods	1
Endowed	1
with	1
all	1
their	1
gifts,	1
and	1
O!	1
too	1
like	1
In	1
sad	1
event,	1
when	1
to	1
the	1
unwiser	1
son	1
Of	1
Japhet	1
brought	1
by	1
Hermes,	1
she	1
ensnared	1
Mankind	1
with	1
her	1
fair	1
looks,	1
to	1
be	1
avenged	1
On	1
him	1
who	1
had	1
stole	1
Jove's	1
authentick	1
fire.	1
Thus,	1
at	1
their	1
shady	1
lodge	1
arrived,	1
both	1
stood,	1
Both	1
turned,	1
and	1
under	1
open	1
sky	1
adored	1
The	1
God	1
that	1
made	1
both	1
sky,	1
air,	1
earth,	1
and	1
heaven,	1
Which	1
they	1
beheld,	1
the	1
moon's	1
resplendent	1
globe,	1
And	1
starry	1
pole:	1
Thou	1
also	1
madest	1
the	1
night,	1
Maker	1
Omnipotent,	1
and	1
thou	1
the	1
day,	1
Which	1
we,	1
in	1
our	1
appointed	1
work	1
employed,	1
Have	1
finished,	1
happy	1
in	1
our	1
mutual	1
help	1
And	1
mutual	1
love,	1
the	1
crown	1
of	1
all	1
our	1
bliss	1
Ordained	1
by	1
thee;	1
and	1
this	1
delicious	1
place	1
For	1
us	1
too	1
large,	1
where	1
thy	1
abundance	1
wants	1
Partakers,	1
and	1
uncropt	1
falls	1
to	1
the	1
ground.	1
But	1
thou	1
hast	1
promised	1
from	1
us	1
two	1
a	1
race	1
To	1
fill	1
the	1
earth,	1
who	1
shall	1
with	1
us	1
extol	1
Thy	1
goodness	1
infinite,	1
both	1
when	1
we	1
wake,	1
And	1
when	1
we	1
seek,	1
as	1
now,	1
thy	1
gift	1
of	1
sleep.	1
This	1
said	1
unanimous,	1
and	1
other	1
rites	1
Observing	1
none,	1
but	1
adoration	1
pure	1
Which	1
God	1
likes	1
best,	1
into	1
their	1
inmost	1
bower	1
Handed	1
they	1
went;	1
and,	1
eased	1
the	1
putting	1
off	1
These	1
troublesome	1
disguises	1
which	1
we	1
wear,	1
Straight	1
side	1
by	1
side	1
were	1
laid;	1
nor	1
turned,	1
I	1
ween,	1
Adam	1
from	1
his	1
fair	1
spouse,	1
nor	1
Eve	1
the	1
rites	1
Mysterious	1
of	1
connubial	1
love	1
refused:	1
Whatever	1
hypocrites	1
austerely	1
talk	1
Of	1
purity,	1
and	1
place,	1
and	1
innocence,	1
Defaming	1
as	1
impure	1
what	1
God	1
declares	1
Pure,	1
and	1
commands	1
to	1
some,	1
leaves	1
free	1
to	1
all.	1
Our	1
Maker	1
bids	1
encrease;	1
who	1
bids	1
abstain	1
But	1
our	1
Destroyer,	1
foe	1
to	1
God	1
and	1
Man?	1
Hail,	1
wedded	1
Love,	1
mysterious	1
law,	1
true	1
source	1
Of	1
human	1
offspring,	1
sole	1
propriety	1
In	1
Paradise	1
of	1
all	1
things	1
common	1
else!	1
By	1
thee	1
adulterous	1
Lust	1
was	1
driven	1
from	1
men	1
Among	1
the	1
bestial	1
herds	1
to	1
range;	1
by	1
thee	1
Founded	1
in	1
reason,	1
loyal,	1
just,	1
and	1
pure,	1
Relations	1
dear,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
charities	1
Of	1
father,	1
son,	1
and	1
brother,	1
first	1
were	1
known.	1
Far	1
be	1
it,	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
write	1
thee	1
sin	1
or	1
blame,	1
Or	1
think	1
thee	1
unbefitting	1
holiest	1
place,	1
Perpetual	1
fountain	1
of	1
domestick	1
sweets,	1
Whose	1
bed	1
is	1
undefiled	1
and	1
chaste	1
pronounced,	1
Present,	1
or	1
past,	1
as	1
saints	1
and	1
patriarchs	1
used.	1
Here	1
Love	1
his	1
golden	1
shafts	1
employs,	1
here	1
lights	1
His	1
constant	1
lamp,	1
and	1
waves	1
his	1
purple	1
wings,	1
Reigns	1
here	1
and	1
revels;	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
bought	1
smile	1
Of	1
harlots,	1
loveless,	1
joyless,	1
unendeared,	1
Casual	1
fruition;	1
nor	1
in	1
court-amours,	1
Mixed	1
dance,	1
or	1
wanton	1
mask,	1
or	1
midnight	1
ball,	1
Or	1
serenate,	1
which	1
the	1
starved	1
lover	1
sings	1
To	1
his	1
proud	1
fair,	1
best	1
quitted	1
with	1
disdain.	1
These,	1
lulled	1
by	1
nightingales,	1
embracing	1
slept,	1
And	1
on	1
their	1
naked	1
limbs	1
the	1
flowery	1
roof	1
Showered	1
roses,	1
which	1
the	1
morn	1
repaired.	1
Sleep	1
on,	1
Blest	1
pair;	1
and	1
O!yet	1
happiest,	1
if	1
ye	1
seek	1
No	1
happier	1
state,	1
and	1
know	1
to	1
know	1
no	1
more.	1
Now	1
had	1
night	1
measured	1
with	1
her	1
shadowy	1
cone	1
Half	1
way	1
up	1
hill	1
this	1
vast	1
sublunar	1
vault,	1
And	1
from	1
their	1
ivory	1
port	1
the	1
Cherubim,	1
Forth	1
issuing	1
at	1
the	1
accustomed	1
hour,	1
stood	1
armed	1
To	1
their	1
night	1
watches	1
in	1
warlike	1
parade;	1
When	1
Gabriel	1
to	1
his	1
next	1
in	1
power	1
thus	1
spake.	1
Uzziel,	1
half	1
these	1
draw	1
off,	1
and	1
coast	1
the	1
south	1
With	1
strictest	1
watch;	1
these	1
other	1
wheel	1
the	1
north;	1
Our	1
circuit	1
meets	1
full	1
west.	1
As	1
flame	1
they	1
part,	1
Half	1
wheeling	1
to	1
the	1
shield,	1
half	1
to	1
the	1
spear.	1
From	1
these,	1
two	1
strong	1
and	1
subtle	1
Spirits	1
he	1
called	1
That	1
near	1
him	1
stood,	1
and	1
gave	1
them	1
thus	1
in	1
charge.	1
Ithuriel	1
and	1
Zephon,	1
with	1
winged	1
speed	1
Search	1
through	1
this	1
garden,	1
leave	1
unsearched	1
no	1
nook;	1
But	1
chiefly	1
where	1
those	1
two	1
fair	1
creatures	1
lodge,	1
Now	1
laid	1
perhaps	1
asleep,	1
secure	1
of	1
harm.	1
This	1
evening	1
from	1
the	1
sun's	1
decline	1
arrived,	1
Who	1
tells	1
of	1
some	1
infernal	1
Spirit	1
seen	1
Hitherward	1
bent	1
(who	1
could	1
have	1
thought?)	1
escaped	1
The	1
bars	1
of	1
Hell,	1
on	1
errand	1
bad	1
no	1
doubt:	1
Such,	1
where	1
ye	1
find,	1
seise	1
fast,	1
and	1
hither	1
bring.	1
So	1
saying,	1
on	1
he	1
led	1
his	1
radiant	1
files,	1
Dazzling	1
the	1
moon;	1
these	1
to	1
the	1
bower	1
direct	1
In	1
search	1
of	1
whom	1
they	1
sought:	1
Him	1
there	1
they	1
found	1
Squat	1
like	1
a	1
toad,	1
close	1
at	1
the	1
ear	1
of	1
Eve,	1
Assaying	1
by	1
his	1
devilish	1
art	1
to	1
reach	1
The	1
organs	1
of	1
her	1
fancy,	1
and	1
with	1
them	1
forge	1
Illusions,	1
as	1
he	1
list,	1
phantasms	1
and	1
dreams;	1
Or	1
if,	1
inspiring	1
venom,	1
he	1
might	1
taint	1
The	1
animal	1
spirits,	1
that	1
from	1
pure	1
blood	1
arise	1
Like	1
gentle	1
breaths	1
from	1
rivers	1
pure,	1
thence	1
raise	1
At	1
least	1
distempered,	1
discontented	1
thoughts,	1
Vain	1
hopes,	1
vain	1
aims,	1
inordinate	1
desires,	1
Blown	1
up	1
with	1
high	1
conceits	1
ingendering	1
pride.	1
Him	1
thus	1
intent	1
Ithuriel	1
with	1
his	1
spear	1
Touched	1
lightly;	1
for	1
no	1
falshood	1
can	1
endure	1
Touch	1
of	1
celestial	1
temper,	1
but	1
returns	1
Of	1
force	1
to	1
its	1
own	1
likeness:	1
Up	1
he	1
starts	1
Discovered	1
and	1
surprised.	1
As	1
when	1
a	1
spark	1
Lights	1
on	1
a	1
heap	1
of	1
nitrous	1
powder,	1
laid	1
Fit	1
for	1
the	1
tun	1
some	1
magazine	1
to	1
store	1
Against	1
a	1
rumoured	1
war,	1
the	1
smutty	1
grain,	1
With	1
sudden	1
blaze	1
diffused,	1
inflames	1
the	1
air;	1
So	1
started	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
shape	1
the	1
Fiend.	1
Back	1
stept	1
those	1
two	1
fair	1
Angels,	1
half	1
amazed	1
So	1
sudden	1
to	1
behold	1
the	1
grisly	1
king;	1
Yet	1
thus,	1
unmoved	1
with	1
fear,	1
accost	1
him	1
soon.	1
Which	1
of	1
those	1
rebel	1
Spirits	1
adjudged	1
to	1
Hell	1
Comest	1
thou,	1
escaped	1
thy	1
prison?	1
and,	1
transformed,	1
Why	1
sat'st	1
thou	1
like	1
an	1
enemy	1
in	1
wait,	1
Here	1
watching	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
these	1
that	1
sleep?	1
Know	1
ye	1
not	1
then	1
said	1
Satan,	1
filled	1
with	1
scorn,	1
Know	1
ye	1
not	1
me?	1
ye	1
knew	1
me	1
once	1
no	1
mate	1
For	1
you,	1
there	1
sitting	1
where	1
ye	1
durst	1
not	1
soar:	1
Not	1
to	1
know	1
me	1
argues	1
yourselves	1
unknown,	1
The	1
lowest	1
of	1
your	1
throng;	1
or,	1
if	1
ye	1
know,	1
Why	1
ask	1
ye,	1
and	1
superfluous	1
begin	1
Your	1
message,	1
like	1
to	1
end	1
as	1
much	1
in	1
vain?	1
To	1
whom	1
thus	1
Zephon,	1
answering	1
scorn	1
with	1
scorn.	1
Think	1
not,	1
revolted	1
Spirit,	1
thy	1
shape	1
the	1
same,	1
Or	1
undiminished	1
brightness	1
to	1
be	1
known,	1
As	1
when	1
thou	1
stoodest	1
in	1
Heaven	1
upright	1
and	1
pure;	1
That	1
glory	1
then,	1
when	1
thou	1
no	1
more	1
wast	1
good,	1
Departed	1
from	1
thee;	1
and	1
thou	1
resemblest	1
now	1
Thy	1
sin	1
and	1
place	1
of	1
doom	1
obscure	1
and	1
foul.	1
But	1
come,	1
for	1
thou,	1
be	1
sure,	1
shalt	1
give	1
account	1
To	1
him	1
who	1
sent	1
us,	1
whose	1
charge	1
is	1
to	1
keep	1
This	1
place	1
inviolable,	1
and	1
these	1
from	1
harm.	1
So	1
spake	1
the	1
Cherub;	1
and	1
his	1
grave	1
rebuke,	1
Severe	1
in	1
youthful	1
beauty,	1
added	1
grace	1
Invincible:	1
Abashed	1
the	1
Devil	1
stood,	1
And	1
felt	1
how	1
awful	1
goodness	1
is,	1
and	1
saw	1
Virtue	1
in	1
her	1
shape	1
how	1
lovely;	1
saw,	1
and	1
pined	1
His	1
loss;	1
but	1
chiefly	1
to	1
find	1
here	1
observed	1
His	1
lustre	1
visibly	1
impaired;	1
yet	1
seemed	1
Undaunted.	1
If	1
I	1
must	1
contend,	1
said	1
he,	1
Best	1
with	1
the	1
best,	1
the	1
sender,	1
not	1
the	1
sent,	1
Or	1
all	1
at	1
once;	1
more	1
glory	1
will	1
be	1
won,	1
Or	1
less	1
be	1
lost.	1
Thy	1
fear,	1
said	1
Zephon	1
bold,	1
Will	1
save	1
us	1
trial	1
what	1
the	1
least	1
can	1
do	1
Single	1
against	1
thee	1
wicked,	1
and	1
thence	1
weak.	1
The	1
Fiend	1
replied	1
not,	1
overcome	1
with	1
rage;	1
But,	1
like	1
a	1
proud	1
steed	1
reined,	1
went	1
haughty	1
on,	1
Champing	1
his	1
iron	1
curb:	1
To	1
strive	1
or	1
fly	1
He	1
held	1
it	1
vain;	1
awe	1
from	1
above	1
had	1
quelled	1
His	1
heart,	1
not	1
else	1
dismayed.	1
Now	1
drew	1
they	1
nigh	1
The	1
western	1
point,	1
where	1
those	1
half-rounding	1
guards	1
Just	1
met,	1
and	1
closing	1
stood	1
in	1
squadron	1
joined,	1
A	1
waiting	1
next	1
command.	1
To	1
whom	1
their	1
Chief,	1
Gabriel,	1
from	1
the	1
front	1
thus	1
called	1
aloud.	1
O	1
friends!	1
I	1
hear	1
the	1
tread	1
of	1
nimble	1
feet	1
Hasting	1
this	1
way,	1
and	1
now	1
by	1
glimpse	1
discern	1
Ithuriel	1
and	1
Zephon	1
through	1
the	1
shade;	1
And	1
with	1
them	1
comes	1
a	1
third	1
of	1
regal	1
port,	1
But	1
faded	1
splendour	1
wan;	1
who	1
by	1
his	1
gait	1
And	1
fierce	1
demeanour	1
seems	1
the	1
Prince	1
of	1
Hell,	1
Not	1
likely	1
to	1
part	1
hence	1
without	1
contest;	1
Stand	1
firm,	1
for	1
in	1
his	1
look	1
defiance	1
lours.	1
He	1
scarce	1
had	1
ended,	1
when	1
those	1
two	1
approached,	1
And	1
brief	1
related	1
whom	1
they	1
brought,	1
where	1
found,	1
How	1
busied,	1
in	1
what	1
form	1
and	1
posture	1
couched.	1
To	1
whom	1
with	1
stern	1
regard	1
thus	1
Gabriel	1
spake.	1
Why	1
hast	1
thou,	1
Satan,	1
broke	1
the	1
bounds	1
prescribed	1
To	1
thy	1
transgressions,	1
and	1
disturbed	1
the	1
charge	1
Of	1
others,	1
who	1
approve	1
not	1
to	1
transgress	1
By	1
thy	1
example,	1
but	1
have	1
power	1
and	1
right	1
To	1
question	1
thy	1
bold	1
entrance	1
on	1
this	1
place;	1
Employed,	1
it	1
seems,	1
to	1
violate	1
sleep,	1
and	1
those	1
Whose	1
dwelling	1
God	1
hath	1
planted	1
here	1
in	1
bliss!	1
To	1
whom	1
thus	1
Satan	1
with	1
contemptuous	1
brow.	1
Gabriel?	1
thou	1
hadst	1
in	1
Heaven	1
the	1
esteem	1
of	1
wise,	1
And	1
such	1
I	1
held	1
thee;	1
but	1
this	1
question	1
asked	1
Puts	1
me	1
in	1
doubt.	1
Lives	1
there	1
who	1
loves	1
his	1
pain!	1
Who	1
would	1
not,	1
finding	1
way,	1
break	1
loose	1
from	1
Hell,	1
Though	1
thither	1
doomed!	1
Thou	1
wouldst	1
thyself,	1
no	1
doubt	1
And	1
boldly	1
venture	1
to	1
whatever	1
place	1
Farthest	1
from	1
pain,	1
where	1
thou	1
mightst	1
hope	1
to	1
change	1
Torment	1
with	1
ease,	1
and	1
soonest	1
recompense	1
Dole	1
with	1
delight,	1
which	1
in	1
this	1
place	1
I	1
sought;	1
To	1
thee	1
no	1
reason,	1
who	1
knowest	1
only	1
good,	1
But	1
evil	1
hast	1
not	1
tried:	1
and	1
wilt	1
object	1
His	1
will	1
who	1
bounds	1
us!	1
Let	1
him	1
surer	1
bar	1
His	1
iron	1
gates,	1
if	1
he	1
intends	1
our	1
stay	1
In	1
that	1
dark	1
durance:	1
Thus	1
much	1
what	1
was	1
asked.	1
The	1
rest	1
is	1
true,	1
they	1
found	1
me	1
where	1
they	1
say;	1
But	1
that	1
implies	1
not	1
violence	1
or	1
harm.	1
Thus	1
he	1
in	1
scorn.	1
The	1
warlike	1
Angel	1
moved,	1
Disdainfully	1
half	1
smiling,	1
thus	1
replied.	1
O	1
loss	1
of	1
one	1
in	1
Heaven	1
to	1
judge	1
of	1
wise	1
Since	1
Satan	1
fell,	1
whom	1
folly	1
overthrew,	1
And	1
now	1
returns	1
him	1
from	1
his	1
prison	1
'scaped,	1
Gravely	1
in	1
doubt	1
whether	1
to	1
hold	1
them	1
wise	1
Or	1
not,	1
who	1
ask	1
what	1
boldness	1
brought	1
him	1
hither	1
Unlicensed	1
from	1
his	1
bounds	1
in	1
Hell	1
prescribed;	1
So	1
wise	1
he	1
judges	1
it	1
to	1
fly	1
from	1
pain	1
However,	1
and	1
to	1
'scape	1
his	1
punishment!	1
So	1
judge	1
thou	1
still,	1
presumptuous!	1
till	1
the	1
wrath,	1
Which	1
thou	1
incurrest	1
by	1
flying,	1
meet	1
thy	1
flight	1
Sevenfold,	1
and	1
scourge	1
that	1
wisdom	1
back	1
to	1
Hell,	1
Which	1
taught	1
thee	1
yet	1
no	1
better,	1
that	1
no	1
pain	1
Can	1
equal	1
anger	1
infinite	1
provoked.	1
But	1
wherefore	1
thou	1
alone?	1
wherefore	1
with	1
thee	1
Came	1
not	1
all	1
hell	1
broke	1
loose?	1
or	1
thou	1
than	1
they	1
Less	1
hardy	1
to	1
endure?	1
Courageous	1
Chief!	1
The	1
first	1
in	1
flight	1
from	1
pain!	1
hadst	1
thou	1
alleged	1
To	1
thy	1
deserted	1
host	1
this	1
cause	1
of	1
flight,	1
Thou	1
surely	1
hadst	1
not	1
come	1
sole	1
fugitive.	1
To	1
which	1
the	1
Fiend	1
thus	1
answered,	1
frowning	1
stern.	1
Not	1
that	1
I	1
less	1
endure,	1
or	1
shrink	1
from	1
pain,	1
Insulting	1
Angel!	1
well	1
thou	1
knowest	1
I	1
stood	1
Thy	1
fiercest,	1
when	1
in	1
battle	1
to	1
thy	1
aid	1
The	1
blasting	1
vollied	1
thunder	1
made	1
all	1
speed,	1
And	1
seconded	1
thy	1
else	1
not	1
dreaded	1
spear.	1
But	1
still	1
thy	1
words	1
at	1
random,	1
as	1
before,	1
Argue	1
thy	1
inexperience	1
what	1
behoves	1
From	1
hard	1
assays	1
and	1
ill	1
successes	1
past	1
A	1
faithful	1
leader,	1
not	1
to	1
hazard	1
all	1
Through	1
ways	1
of	1
danger	1
by	1
himself	1
untried:	1
I,	1
therefore,	1
I	1
alone	1
first	1
undertook	1
To	1
wing	1
the	1
desolate	1
abyss,	1
and	1
spy	1
This	1
new	1
created	1
world,	1
whereof	1
in	1
Hell	1
Fame	1
is	1
not	1
silent,	1
here	1
in	1
hope	1
to	1
find	1
Better	1
abode,	1
and	1
my	1
afflicted	1
Powers	1
To	1
settle	1
here	1
on	1
earth,	1
or	1
in	1
mid	1
air;	1
Though	1
for	1
possession	1
put	1
to	1
try	1
once	1
more	1
What	1
thou	1
and	1
thy	1
gay	1
legions	1
dare	1
against;	1
Whose	1
easier	1
business	1
were	1
to	1
serve	1
their	1
Lord	1
High	1
up	1
in	1
Heaven,	1
with	1
songs	1
to	1
hymn	1
his	1
throne,	1
And	1
practised	1
distances	1
to	1
cringe,	1
not	1
fight,	1
To	1
whom	1
the	1
warriour	1
Angel	1
soon	1
replied.	1
To	1
say	1
and	1
straight	1
unsay,	1
pretending	1
first	1
Wise	1
to	1
fly	1
pain,	1
professing	1
next	1
the	1
spy,	1
Argues	1
no	1
leader	1
but	1
a	1
liear	1
traced,	1
Satan,	1
and	1
couldst	1
thou	1
faithful	1
add?	1
O	1
name,	1
O	1
sacred	1
name	1
of	1
faithfulness	1
profaned!	1
Faithful	1
to	1
whom?	1
to	1
thy	1
rebellious	1
crew?	1
Army	1
of	1
Fiends,	1
fit	1
body	1
to	1
fit	1
head.	1
Was	1
this	1
your	1
discipline	1
and	1
faith	1
engaged,	1
Your	1
military	1
obedience,	1
to	1
dissolve	1
Allegiance	1
to	1
the	1
acknowledged	1
Power	1
supreme?	1
And	1
thou,	1
sly	1
hypocrite,	1
who	1
now	1
wouldst	1
seem	1
Patron	1
of	1
liberty,	1
who	1
more	1
than	1
thou	1
Once	1
fawned,	1
and	1
cringed,	1
and	1
servily	1
adored	1
Heaven's	1
awful	1
Monarch?	1
wherefore,	1
but	1
in	1
hope	1
To	1
dispossess	1
him,	1
and	1
thyself	1
to	1
reign?	1
But	1
mark	1
what	1
I	1
arreed	1
thee	1
now,	1
Avant;	1
Fly	1
neither	1
whence	1
thou	1
fledst!	1
If	1
from	1
this	1
hour	1
Within	1
these	1
hallowed	1
limits	1
thou	1
appear,	1
Back	1
to	1
the	1
infernal	1
pit	1
I	1
drag	1
thee	1
chained,	1
And	1
seal	1
thee	1
so,	1
as	1
henceforth	1
not	1
to	1
scorn	1
The	1
facile	1
gates	1
of	1
Hell	1
too	1
slightly	1
barred.	1
So	1
threatened	1
he;	1
but	1
Satan	1
to	1
no	1
threats	1
Gave	1
heed,	1
but	1
waxing	1
more	1
in	1
rage	1
replied.	1
Then	1
when	1
I	1
am	1
thy	1
captive	1
talk	1
of	1
chains,	1
Proud	1
limitary	1
Cherub!	1
but	1
ere	1
then	1
Far	1
heavier	1
load	1
thyself	1
expect	1
to	1
feel	1
From	1
my	1
prevailing	1
arm,	1
though	1
Heaven's	1
King	1
Ride	1
on	1
thy	1
wings,	1
and	1
thou	1
with	1
thy	1
compeers,	1
Us'd	1
to	1
the	1
yoke,	1
drawest	1
his	1
triumphant	1
wheels	1
In	1
progress	1
through	1
the	1
road	1
of	1
Heaven	1
star-paved.	1
While	1
thus	1
he	1
spake,	1
the	1
angelick	1
squadron	1
bright	1
Turned	1
fiery	1
red,	1
sharpening	1
in	1
mooned	1
horns	1
Their	1
phalanx,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
hem	1
him	1
round	1
With	1
ported	1
spears,	1
as	1
thick	1
as	1
when	1
a	1
field	1
Of	1
Ceres	1
ripe	1
for	1
harvest	1
waving	1
bends	1
Her	1
bearded	1
grove	1
of	1
ears,	1
which	1
way	1
the	1
wind	1
Sways	1
them;	1
the	1
careful	1
plowman	1
doubting	1
stands,	1
Left	1
on	1
the	1
threshing	1
floor	1
his	1
hopeless	1
sheaves	1
Prove	1
chaff.	1
On	1
the	1
other	1
side,	1
Satan,	1
alarmed,	1
Collecting	1
all	1
his	1
might,	1
dilated	1
stood,	1
Like	1
Teneriff	1
or	1
Atlas,	1
unremoved:	1
His	1
stature	1
reached	1
the	1
sky,	1
and	1
on	1
his	1
crest	1
Sat	1
Horrour	1
plumed;	1
nor	1
wanted	1
in	1
his	1
grasp	1
What	1
seemed	1
both	1
spear	1
and	1
shield:	1
Now	1
dreadful	1
deeds	1
Might	1
have	1
ensued,	1
nor	1
only	1
Paradise	1
In	1
this	1
commotion,	1
but	1
the	1
starry	1
cope	1
Of	1
Heaven	1
perhaps,	1
or	1
all	1
the	1
elements	1
At	1
least	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
wrack,	1
disturbed	1
and	1
torn	1
With	1
violence	1
of	1
this	1
conflict,	1
had	1
not	1
soon	1
The	1
Eternal,	1
to	1
prevent	1
such	1
horrid	1
fray,	1
Hung	1
forth	1
in	1
Heaven	1
his	1
golden	1
scales,	1
yet	1
seen	1
Betwixt	1
Astrea	1
and	1
the	1
Scorpion	1
sign,	1
Wherein	1
all	1
things	1
created	1
first	1
he	1
weighed,	1
The	1
pendulous	1
round	1
earth	1
with	1
balanced	1
air	1
In	1
counterpoise,	1
now	1
ponders	1
all	1
events,	1
Battles	1
and	1
realms:	1
In	1
these	1
he	1
put	1
two	1
weights,	1
The	1
sequel	1
each	1
of	1
parting	1
and	1
of	1
fight:	1
The	1
latter	1
quick	1
up	1
flew,	1
and	1
kicked	1
the	1
beam,	1
Which	1
Gabriel	1
spying,	1
thus	1
bespake	1
the	1
Fiend.	1
Satan,	1
I	1
know	1
thy	1
strength,	1
and	1
thou	1
knowest	1
mine;	1
Neither	1
our	1
own,	1
but	1
given:	1
What	1
folly	1
then	1
To	1
boast	1
what	1
arms	1
can	1
do?	1
since	1
thine	1
no	1
more	1
Than	1
Heaven	1
permits,	1
nor	1
mine,	1
though	1
doubled	1
now	1
To	1
trample	1
thee	1
as	1
mire:	1
For	1
proof	1
look	1
up,	1
And	1
read	1
thy	1
lot	1
in	1
yon	1
celestial	1
sign;	1
Where	1
thou	1
art	1
weighed,	1
and	1
shown	1
how	1
light,	1
how	1
weak,	1
If	1
thou	1
resist.	1
The	1
Fiend	1
looked	1
up,	1
and	1
knew	1
His	1
mounted	1
scale	1
aloft:	1
Nor	1
more;but	1
fled	1
Murmuring,	1
and	1
with	1
him	1
fled	1
the	1
shades	1
of	1
night.	1
Book	1
V	1
Now	1
Morn,	1
her	1
rosy	1
steps	1
in	1
the	1
eastern	1
clime	1
Advancing,	1
sowed	1
the	1
earth	1
with	1
orient	1
pearl,	1
When	1
Adam	1
waked,	1
so	1
customed;	1
for	1
his	1
sleep	1
Was	1
aery-light,	1
from	1
pure	1
digestion	1
bred,	1
And	1
temperate	1
vapours	1
bland,	1
which	1
the	1
only	1
sound	1
Of	1
leaves	1
and	1
fuming	1
rills,	1
Aurora's	1
fan,	1
Lightly	1
dispersed,	1
and	1
the	1
shrill	1
matin	1
song	1
Of	1
birds	1
on	1
every	1
bough;	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
more	1
His	1
wonder	1
was	1
to	1
find	1
unwakened	1
Eve	1
With	1
tresses	1
discomposed,	1
and	1
glowing	1
cheek,	1
As	1
through	1
unquiet	1
rest:	1
He,	1
on	1
his	1
side	1
Leaning	1
half	1
raised,	1
with	1
looks	1
of	1
cordial	1
love	1
Hung	1
over	1
her	1
enamoured,	1
and	1
beheld	1
Beauty,	1
which,	1
whether	1
waking	1
or	1
asleep,	1
Shot	1
forth	1
peculiar	1
graces;	1
then	1
with	1
voice	1
Mild,	1
as	1
when	1
Zephyrus	1
on	1
Flora	1
breathes,	1
Her	1
hand	1
soft	1
touching,	1
whispered	1
thus.	1
Awake,	1
My	1
fairest,	1
my	1
espoused,	1
my	1
latest	1
found,	1
Heaven's	1
last	1
best	1
gift,	1
my	1
ever	1
new	1
delight!	1
Awake:	1
The	1
morning	1
shines,	1
and	1
the	1
fresh	1
field	1
Calls	1
us;	1
we	1
lose	1
the	1
prime,	1
to	1
mark	1
how	1
spring	1
Our	1
tender	1
plants,	1
how	1
blows	1
the	1
citron	1
grove,	1
What	1
drops	1
the	1
myrrh,	1
and	1
what	1
the	1
balmy	1
reed,	1
How	1
nature	1
paints	1
her	1
colours,	1
how	1
the	1
bee	1
Sits	1
on	1
the	1
bloom	1
extracting	1
liquid	1
sweet.	1
Such	1
whispering	1
waked	1
her,	1
but	1
with	1
startled	1
eye	1
On	1
Adam,	1
whom	1
embracing,	1
thus	1
she	1
spake.	1
O	1
sole	1
in	1
whom	1
my	1
thoughts	1
find	1
all	1
repose,	1
My	1
glory,	1
my	1
perfection!	1
glad	1
I	1
see	1
Thy	1
face,	1
and	1
morn	1
returned;	1
for	1
I	1
this	1
night	1
(Such	1
night	1
till	1
this	1
I	1
never	1
passed)	1
have	1
dreamed,	1
If	1
dreamed,	1
not,	1
as	1
I	1
oft	1
am	1
wont,	1
of	1
thee,	1
Works	1
of	1
day	1
past,	1
or	1
morrow's	1
next	1
design,	1
But	1
of	1
offence	1
and	1
trouble,	1
which	1
my	1
mind	1
Knew	1
never	1
till	1
this	1
irksome	1
night:	1
Methought,	1
Close	1
at	1
mine	1
ear	1
one	1
called	1
me	1
forth	1
to	1
walk	1
With	1
gentle	1
voice;	1
I	1
thought	1
it	1
thine:	1
It	1
said,	1
'Why	1
sleepest	1
thou,	1
Eve?	1
now	1
is	1
the	1
pleasant	1
time,	1
'The	1
cool,	1
the	1
silent,	1
save	1
where	1
silence	1
yields	1
'To	1
the	1
night-warbling	1
bird,	1
that	1
now	1
awake	1
'Tunes	1
sweetest	1
his	1
love-laboured	1
song;	1
now	1
reigns	1
'Full-orbed	1
the	1
moon,	1
and	1
with	1
more	1
pleasing	1
light	1
'Shadowy	1
sets	1
off	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
things;	1
in	1
vain,	1
'If	1
none	1
regard;	1
Heaven	1
wakes	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
eyes,	1
'Whom	1
to	1
behold	1
but	1
thee,	1
Nature's	1
desire?	1
'In	1
whose	1
sight	1
all	1
things	1
joy,	1
with	1
ravishment	1
'Attracted	1
by	1
thy	1
beauty	1
still	1
to	1
gaze.'	1
I	1
rose	1
as	1
at	1
thy	1
call,	1
but	1
found	1
thee	1
not;	1
To	1
find	1
thee	1
I	1
directed	1
then	1
my	1
walk;	1
And	1
on,	1
methought,	1
alone	1
I	1
passed	1
through	1
ways	1
That	1
brought	1
me	1
on	1
a	1
sudden	1
to	1
the	1
tree	1
Of	1
interdicted	1
knowledge:	1
fair	1
it	1
seemed,	1
Much	1
fairer	1
to	1
my	1
fancy	1
than	1
by	1
day:	1
And,	1
as	1
I	1
wondering	1
looked,	1
beside	1
it	1
stood	1
One	1
shaped	1
and	1
winged	1
like	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
from	1
Heaven	1
By	1
us	1
oft	1
seen;	1
his	1
dewy	1
locks	1
distilled	1
Ambrosia;	1
on	1
that	1
tree	1
he	1
also	1
gazed;	1
And	1
'O	1
fair	1
plant,'	1
said	1
he,	1
'with	1
fruit	1
surcharged,	1
'Deigns	1
none	1
to	1
ease	1
thy	1
load,	1
and	1
taste	1
thy	1
sweet,	1
'Nor	1
God,	1
nor	1
Man?	1
Is	1
knowledge	1
so	1
despised?	1
'Or	1
envy,	1
or	1
what	1
reserve	1
forbids	1
to	1
taste?	1
'Forbid	1
who	1
will,	1
none	1
shall	1
from	1
me	1
withhold	1
'Longer	1
thy	1
offered	1
good;	1
why	1
else	1
set	1
here?	1
This	1
said,	1
he	1
paused	1
not,	1
but	1
with	1
venturous	1
arm	1
He	1
plucked,	1
he	1
tasted;	1
me	1
damp	1
horrour	1
chilled	1
At	1
such	1
bold	1
words	1
vouched	1
with	1
a	1
deed	1
so	1
bold:	1
But	1
he	1
thus,	1
overjoyed;	1
'O	1
fruit	1
divine,	1
'Sweet	1
of	1
thyself,	1
but	1
much	1
more	1
sweet	1
thus	1
cropt,	1
'Forbidden	1
here,	1
it	1
seems,	1
as	1
only	1
fit	1
'For	1
Gods,	1
yet	1
able	1

make	1
Gods	1

Men:	1
'And	1
why	1
not	1
Gods	1
of	1
Men;	1
since	1
good,	1
the	1
more	1
'Communicated,	1
more	1
abundant	1
grows,	1
'The	1
author	1
not	1
impaired,	1
but	1
honoured	1
more?	1
'Here,	1
happy	1
creature,	1
fair	1
angelick	1
Eve!	1
'Partake	1
thou	1
also;	1
happy	1
though	1
thou	1
art,	1
'Happier	1
thou	1
mayest	1
be,	1
worthier	1
canst	1
not	1
be:	1
'Taste	1
this,	1
and	1
be	1
henceforth	1
among	1
the	1
Gods	1
'Thyself	1
a	1
Goddess,	1
not	1
to	1
earth	1
confined,	1
'But	1
sometimes	1
in	1
the	1
air,	1
as	1
we,	1
sometimes	1
'Ascend	1
to	1
Heaven,	1
by	1

thine,	1
and	1
see	1
'What	1
life	1
the	1

live	1
there,	1
and	1
such	1
live	1
thou!'	1
So	1
saying,	1
he	1
drew	1
nigh,	1
and	1
to	1
me	1
held,	1
Even	1
to	1
my	1
mouth	1
of	1
that	1
same	1
fruit	1
held	1
part	1
Which	1
he	1
had	1
plucked;	1
the	1
pleasant	1
savoury	1
smell	1
So	1
quickened	1
appetite,	1
that	1
I,	1
methought,	1
Could	1
not	1
but	1
taste.	1
Forthwith	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
clouds	1
With	1
him	1
I	1
flew,	1
and	1
underneath	1
beheld	1
The	1
earth	1
outstretched	1
immense,	1
a	1
prospect	1
wide	1
And	1
various:	1
Wondering	1
at	1
my	1
flight	1
and	1
change	1
To	1
this	1
high	1
exaltation;	1
suddenly	1
My	1
guide	1
was	1
gone,	1
and	1
I,	1
methought,	1
sunk	1
down,	1
And	1
fell	1
asleep;	1
but	1
O,	1
how	1
glad	1
I	1
waked	1
To	1
find	1
this	1
but	1
a	1
dream!	1
Thus	1
Eve	1
her	1
night	1
Related,	1
and	1
thus	1
Adam	1
answered	1
sad.	1
Best	1
image	1
of	1
myself,	1
and	1
dearer	1
half,	1
The	1
trouble	1
of	1
thy	1
thoughts	1
this	1
night	1
in	1
sleep	1
Affects	1
me	1
equally;	1
nor	1
can	1
I	1
like	1
This	1
uncouth	1
dream,	1
of	1
evil	1
sprung,	1
I	1
fear;	1
Yet	1
evil	1
whence?	1
in	1
thee	1
can	1
harbour	1
none,	1
Created	1
pure.	1
But	1
know	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
soul	1
Are	1
many	1
lesser	1
faculties,	1
that	1
serve	1
Reason	1
as	1
chief;	1
among	1
these	1
Fancy	1
next	1
Her	1
office	1
holds;	1
of	1
all	1
external	1
things	1
Which	1
the	1
five	1
watchful	1
senses	1
represent,	1
She	1
forms	1
imaginations,	1
aery	1
shapes,	1
Which	1
Reason,	1
joining	1
or	1
disjoining,	1
frames	1
All	1
what	1
we	1
affirm	1
or	1
what	1
deny,	1
and	1
call	1
Our	1
knowledge	1
or	1
opinion;	1
then	1
retires	1
Into	1
her	1
private	1
cell,	1
when	1
nature	1
rests.	1
Oft	1
in	1
her	1
absence	1
mimick	1
Fancy	1
wakes	1
To	1
imitate	1
her;	1
but,	1
misjoining	1
shapes,	1
Wild	1
work	1
produces	1
oft,	1
and	1
most	1
in	1
dreams;	1
Ill	1
matching	1
words	1
and	1
deeds	1
long	1
past	1
or	1
late.	1
Some	1
such	1
resemblances,	1
methinks,	1
I	1
find	1
Of	1
our	1
last	1
evening's	1
talk,	1
in	1
this	1
thy	1
dream,	1
But	1
with	1
addition	1
strange;	1
yet	1
be	1
not	1
sad.	1
Evil	1
into	1
the	1
mind	1
of	1
God	1
or	1
Man	1
May	1
come	1
and	1
go,	1
so	1
unreproved,	1
and	1
leave	1
No	1
spot	1
or	1
blame	1
behind:	1
Which	1
gives	1
me	1
hope	1
That	1
what	1
in	1
sleep	1
thou	1
didst	1
abhor	1
to	1
dream,	1
Waking	1
thou	1
never	1
will	1
consent	1
to	1
do.	1
Be	1
not	1
disheartened	1
then,	1
nor	1
cloud	1
those	1
looks,	1
That	1
wont	1
to	1
be	1
more	1
cheerful	1
and	1
serene,	1
Than	1
when	1
fair	1
morning	1
first	1
smiles	1
on	1
the	1
world;	1
And	1
let	1
us	1
to	1
our	1
fresh	1
employments	1
rise	1
Among	1
the	1
groves,	1
the	1
fountains,	1
and	1
the	1
flowers	1
That	1
open	1
now	1
their	1
choisest	1
bosomed	1
smells,	1
Reserved	1
from	1
night,	1
and	1
kept	1
for	1
thee	1
in	1
store.	1
So	1
cheered	1
he	1
his	1
fair	1
spouse,	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
cheered;	1
But	1
silently	1
a	1
gentle	1
tear	1
let	1
fall	1
From	1
either	1
eye,	1
and	1
wiped	1
them	1
with	1
her	1
hair;	1
Two	1
other	1
precious	1
drops	1
that	1
ready	1
stood,	1
Each	1
in	1
their	1
crystal	1
sluice,	1
he	1
ere	1
they	1
fell	1
Kissed,	1
as	1
the	1
gracious	1
signs	1
of	1
sweet	1
remorse	1
And	1
pious	1
awe,	1
that	1
feared	1
to	1
have	1
offended.	1
So	1
all	1
was	1
cleared,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
field	1
they	1
haste.	1
But	1
first,	1
from	1
under	1
shady	1
arborous	1
roof	1
Soon	1
as	1
they	1
forth	1
were	1
come	1
to	1
open	1
sight	1
Of	1
day-spring,	1
and	1
the	1
sun,	1
who,	1
scarce	1
up-risen,	1
With	1
wheels	1
yet	1
hovering	1
o'er	1
the	1
ocean-brim,	1
Shot	1
parallel	1
to	1
the	1
earth	1
his	1
dewy	1
ray,	1
Discovering	1
in	1
wide	1
landskip	1
all	1
the	1
east	1
Of	1
Paradise	1
and	1
Eden's	1
happy	1
plains,	1
Lowly	1
they	1
bowed	1
adoring,	1
and	1
began	1
Their	1
orisons,	1
each	1
morning	1
duly	1
paid	1
In	1
various	1
style;	1
for	1
neither	1
various	1
style	1
Nor	1
holy	1
rapture	1
wanted	1
they	1
to	1
praise	1
Their	1
Maker,	1
in	1
fit	1
strains	1
pronounced,	1
or	1
sung	1
Unmeditated;	1
such	1
prompt	1
eloquence	1
Flowed	1
from	1
their	1
lips,	1
in	1
prose	1
or	1
numerous	1
verse,	1
More	1
tuneable	1
than	1
needed	1
lute	1
or	1
harp	1
To	1
add	1
more	1
sweetness;	1
and	1
they	1
thus	1
began.	1
These	1
are	1
thy	1
glorious	1
works,	1
Parent	1
of	1
good,	1
Almighty!	1
Thine	1
this	1
universal	1
frame,	1
Thus	1
wonderous	1
fair;	1
Thyself	1
how	1
wonderous	1
then!	1
Unspeakable,	1
who	1
sitst	1
above	1
these	1
heavens	1
To	1
us	1
invisible,	1
or	1
dimly	1
seen	1
In	1
these	1
thy	1
lowest	1
works;	1
yet	1
these	1
declare	1
Thy	1
goodness	1
beyond	1
thought,	1
and	1
power	1
divine.	1
Speak,	1
ye	1
who	1
best	1
can	1
tell,	1
ye	1
sons	1
of	1
light,	1
Angels;	1
for	1
ye	1
behold	1
him,	1
and	1
with	1
songs	1
And	1
choral	1
symphonies,	1
day	1
without	1
night,	1
Circle	1
his	1
throne	1
rejoicing;	1
ye	1
in	1
Heaven	1
On	1
Earth	1
join	1
all	1
ye	1
Creatures	1
to	1
extol	1
Him	1
first,	1
him	1
last,	1
him	1
midst,	1
and	1
without	1
end.	1
Fairest	1
of	1
stars,	1
last	1
in	1
the	1
train	1
of	1
night,	1
If	1
better	1
thou	1
belong	1
not	1
to	1
the	1
dawn,	1
Sure	1
pledge	1
of	1
day,	1
that	1
crownest	1
the	1
smiling	1
morn	1
With	1
thy	1
bright	1
circlet,	1
praise	1
him	1
in	1
thy	1
sphere,	1
While	1
day	1
arises,	1
that	1
sweet	1
hour	1
of	1
prime.	1
Thou	1
Sun,	1
of	1
this	1
great	1
world	1
both	1
eye	1
and	1
soul,	1
Acknowledge	1
him	1
thy	1
greater;	1
sound	1
his	1
praise	1
In	1
thy	1
eternal	1
course,	1
both	1
when	1
thou	1
climbest,	1
And	1
when	1
high	1
noon	1
hast	1
gained,	1
and	1
when	1
thou	1
fallest.	1
Moon,	1
that	1
now	1
meetest	1
the	1
orient	1
sun,	1
now	1
flyest,	1
With	1
the	1
fixed	1
Stars,	1
fixed	1
in	1
their	1
orb	1
that	1
flies;	1
And	1
ye	1
five	1
other	1
wandering	1
Fires,	1
that	1
move	1
In	1
mystick	1
dance	1
not	1
without	1
song,	1
resound	1
His	1
praise,	1
who	1
out	1
of	1
darkness	1
called	1
up	1
light.	1
Air,	1
and	1
ye	1
Elements,	1
the	1
eldest	1
birth	1
Of	1
Nature's	1
womb,	1
that	1
in	1
quaternion	1
run	1
Perpetual	1
circle,	1
multiform;	1
and	1
mix	1
And	1
nourish	1
all	1
things;	1
let	1
your	1
ceaseless	1
change	1
Vary	1
to	1
our	1
great	1
Maker	1
still	1
new	1
praise.	1
Ye	1
Mists	1
and	1
Exhalations,	1
that	1
now	1
rise	1
From	1
hill	1
or	1
steaming	1
lake,	1
dusky	1
or	1
gray,	1
Till	1
the	1
sun	1
paint	1
your	1
fleecy	1
skirts	1
with	1
gold,	1
In	1
honour	1
to	1
the	1
world's	1
great	1
Author	1
rise;	1
Whether	1
to	1
deck	1
with	1
clouds	1
the	1
uncoloured	1
sky,	1
Or	1
wet	1
the	1
thirsty	1
earth	1
with	1
falling	1
showers,	1
Rising	1
or	1
falling	1
still	1
advance	1
his	1
praise.	1
His	1
praise,	1
ye	1
Winds,	1
that	1
from	1
four	1
quarters	1
blow,	1
Breathe	1
soft	1
or	1
loud;	1
and,	1
wave	1
your	1
tops,	1
ye	1
Pines,	1
With	1
every	1
plant,	1
in	1
sign	1
of	1
worship	1
wave.	1
Fountains,	1
and	1
ye	1
that	1
warble,	1
as	1
ye	1
flow,	1
Melodious	1
murmurs,	1
warbling	1
tune	1
his	1
praise.	1
Join	1
voices,	1
all	1
ye	1
living	1
Souls:	1
Ye	1
Birds,	1
That	1
singing	1
up	1
to	1
Heaven-gate	1
ascend,	1
Bear	1
on	1
your	1
wings	1
and	1
in	1
your	1
notes	1
his	1
praise.	1
Ye	1
that	1
in	1
waters	1
glide,	1
and	1
ye	1
that	1
walk	1
The	1
earth,	1
and	1
stately	1
tread,	1
or	1
lowly	1
creep;	1
Witness	1
if	1
I	1
be	1
silent,	1
morn	1
or	1
even,	1
To	1
hill,	1
or	1
valley,	1
fountain,	1
or	1
fresh	1
shade,	1
Made	1
vocal	1
by	1
my	1
song,	1
and	1
taught	1
his	1
praise.	1
Hail,	1
universal	1
Lord,	1
be	1
bounteous	1
still	1
To	1
give	1
us	1
only	1
good;	1
and	1
if	1
the	1
night	1
Have	1
gathered	1
aught	1
of	1
evil,	1
or	1
concealed,	1
Disperse	1
it,	1
as	1
now	1
light	1
dispels	1
the	1
dark!	1
So	1
prayed	1
they	1
innocent,	1
and	1
to	1
their	1
thoughts	1
Firm	1
peace	1
recovered	1
soon,	1
and	1
wonted	1
calm.	1
On	1
to	1
their	1
morning's	1
rural	1
work	1
they	1
haste,	1
Among	1
sweet	1
dews	1
and	1
flowers;	1
where	1
any	1
row	1
Of	1
fruit-trees	1
over-woody	1
reached	1
too	1
far	1
Their	1
pampered	1
boughs,	1
and	1
needed	1
hands	1
to	1
check	1
Fruitless	1
embraces:	1
or	1
they	1
led	1
the	1
vine	1
To	1
wed	1
her	1
elm;	1
she,	1
spoused,	1
about	1
him	1
twines	1
Her	1
marriageable	1
arms,	1
and	1
with	1
him	1
brings	1
Her	1
dower,	1
the	1
adopted	1
clusters,	1
to	1
adorn	1
His	1
barren	1
leaves.	1
Them	1
thus	1
employed	1
beheld	1
With	1
pity	1
Heaven's	1
high	1
King,	1
and	1
to	1
him	1
called	1
Raphael,	1
the	1
sociable	1
Spirit,	1
that	1
deigned	1
To	1
travel	1
with	1
Tobias,	1
and	1
secured	1
His	1
marriage	1
with	1
the	1
seventimes-wedded	1
maid.	1
Raphael,	1
said	1
he,	1
thou	1
hearest	1
what	1
stir	1
on	1
Earth	1
Satan,	1
from	1
Hell	1
'scaped	1
through	1
the	1
darksome	1
gulf,	1
Hath	1
raised	1
in	1
Paradise;	1
and	1
how	1
disturbed	1
This	1
night	1
the	1
human	1
pair;	1
how	1
he	1
designs	1
In	1
them	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
ruin	1
all	1
mankind.	1
Go	1
therefore,	1
half	1
this	1
day	1
as	1
friend	1
with	1
friend	1
Converse	1
with	1
Adam,	1
in	1
what	1
bower	1
or	1
shade	1
Thou	1
findest	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
heat	1
of	1
noon	1
retired,	1
To	1
respite	1
his	1
day-labour	1
with	1
repast,	1
Or	1
with	1
repose;	1
and	1
such	1
discourse	1
bring	1
on,	1
As	1
may	1
advise	1
him	1
of	1
his	1
happy	1
state,	1
Happiness	1
in	1
his	1
power	1
left	1
free	1
to	1
will,	1
Left	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
free	1
will,	1
his	1
will	1
though	1
free,	1
Yet	1
mutable;	1
whence	1
warn	1
him	1
to	1
beware	1
He	1
swerve	1
not,	1
too	1
secure:	1
Tell	1
him	1
withal	1
His	1
danger,	1
and	1
from	1
whom;	1
what	1
enemy,	1
Late	1
fallen	1
himself	1
from	1
Heaven,	1
is	1
plotting	1
now	1
The	1
fall	1
of	1
others	1
from	1
like	1
state	1
of	1
bliss;	1
By	1
violence?	1
no,	1
for	1
that	1
shall	1
be	1
withstood;	1
But	1
by	1
deceit	1
and	1
lies:	1
This	1
let	1
him	1
know,	1
Lest,	1
wilfully	1
transgressing,	1
he	1
pretend	1
Surprisal,	1
unadmonished,	1
unforewarned.	1
So	1
spake	1
the	1
Eternal	1
Father,	1
and	1
fulfilled	1
All	1
justice:	1
Nor	1
delayed	1
the	1
winged	1
Saint	1
After	1
his	1
charge	1
received;	1
but	1
from	1
among	1
Thousand	1
celestial	1
Ardours,	1
where	1
he	1
stood	1
Veiled	1
with	1
his	1
gorgeous	1
wings,	1
up	1
springing	1
light,	1
Flew	1
through	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
Heaven;	1
the	1
angelick	1
quires,	1
On	1
each	1
hand	1
parting,	1
to	1
his	1
speed	1
gave	1
way	1
Through	1
all	1
the	1
empyreal	1
road;	1
till,	1
at	1
the	1
gate	1
Of	1
Heaven	1
arrived,	1
the	1
gate	1
self-opened	1
wide	1
On	1
golden	1
hinges	1
turning,	1
as	1
by	1
work	1
Divine	1
the	1
sovran	1
Architect	1
had	1
framed.	1
From	1
hence	1
no	1
cloud,	1
or,	1
to	1
obstruct	1
his	1
sight,	1
Star	1
interposed,	1
however	1
small	1
he	1
sees,	1
Not	1
unconformed	1
to	1
other	1
shining	1
globes,	1
Earth,	1
and	1
the	1
garden	1
of	1
God,	1
with	1
cedars	1
crowned	1
Above	1
all	1
hills.	1
As	1
when	1
by	1
night	1
the	1
glass	1
Of	1
Galileo,	1
less	1
assured,	1
observes	1
Imagined	1
lands	1
and	1
regions	1
in	1
the	1
moon:	1
Or	1
pilot,	1
from	1
amidst	1
the	1
Cyclades	1
Delos	1
or	1
Samos	1
first	1
appearing,	1
kens	1
A	1
cloudy	1
spot.	1
Down	1
thither	1
prone	1
in	1
flight	1
He	1
speeds,	1
and	1
through	1
the	1
vast	1
ethereal	1
sky	1
Sails	1
between	1
worlds	1
and	1
worlds,	1
with	1
steady	1
wing	1
Now	1
on	1
the	1
polar	1
winds,	1
then	1
with	1
quick	1
fan	1
Winnows	1
the	1
buxom	1
air;	1
till,	1
within	1
soar	1
Of	1
towering	1
eagles,	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
fowls	1
he	1
seems	1
A	1
phoenix,	1
gazed	1
by	1
all	1
as	1
that	1
sole	1
bird,	1
When,	1
to	1
enshrine	1
his	1
reliques	1
in	1
the	1
Sun's	1
Bright	1
temple,	1
to	1
Egyptian	1
Thebes	1
he	1
flies.	1
At	1
once	1
on	1
the	1
eastern	1
cliff	1
of	1
Paradise	1
He	1
lights,	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
proper	1
shape	1
returns	1
A	1
Seraph	1
winged:	1
Six	1
wings	1
he	1
wore,	1
to	1
shade	1
His	1
lineaments	1
divine;	1
the	1
pair	1
that	1
clad	1
Each	1
shoulder	1
broad,	1
came	1
mantling	1
o'er	1
his	1
breast	1
With	1
regal	1
ornament;	1
the	1
middle	1
pair	1
Girt	1
like	1
a	1
starry	1
zone	1
his	1
waist,	1
and	1
round	1
Skirted	1
his	1
loins	1
and	1
thighs	1
with	1
downy	1
gold	1
And	1
colours	1
dipt	1
in	1
Heaven;	1
the	1
third	1
his	1
feet	1
Shadowed	1
from	1
either	1
heel	1
with	1
feathered	1
mail,	1
Sky-tinctured	1
grain.	1
Like	1
Maia's	1
son	1
he	1
stood,	1
And	1
shook	1
his	1
plumes,	1
that	1
heavenly	1
fragrance	1
filled	1
The	1
circuit	1
wide.	1
Straight	1
knew	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
bands	1
Of	1
Angels	1
under	1
watch;	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
state,	1
And	1
to	1
his	1
message	1
high,	1
in	1
honour	1
rise;	1
For	1
on	1
some	1
message	1
high	1
they	1
guessed	1
him	1
bound.	1
Their	1
glittering	1
tents	1
he	1
passed,	1
and	1
now	1
is	1
come	1
Into	1
the	1
blissful	1
field,	1
through	1
groves	1
of	1
myrrh,	1
And	1
flowering	1
odours,	1
cassia,	1
nard,	1
and	1
balm;	1
A	1
wilderness	1
of	1
sweets;	1
for	1
Nature	1
here	1
Wantoned	1
as	1
in	1
her	1
prime,	1
and	1
played	1
at	1
will	1
Her	1
virgin	1
fancies	1
pouring	1
forth	1
more	1
sweet,	1
Wild	1
above	1
rule	1
or	1
art,	1
enormous	1
bliss.	1
Him	1
through	1
the	1
spicy	1
forest	1
onward	1
come	1
Adam	1
discerned,	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
door	1
he	1
sat	1
Of	1
his	1
cool	1
bower,	1
while	1
now	1
the	1
mounted	1
sun	1
Shot	1
down	1
direct	1
his	1
fervid	1
rays	1
to	1
warm	1
Earth's	1
inmost	1
womb,	1
more	1
warmth	1
than	1
Adam	1
needs:	1
And	1
Eve	1
within,	1
due	1
at	1
her	1
hour	1
prepared	1
For	1
dinner	1
savoury	1
fruits,	1
of	1
taste	1
to	1
please	1
True	1
appetite,	1
and	1
not	1
disrelish	1
thirst	1
Of	1
nectarous	1
draughts	1
between,	1
from	1
milky	1
stream,	1
Berry	1
or	1
grape:	1
To	1
whom	1
thus	1
Adam	1
called.	1
Haste	1
hither,	1
Eve,	1
and	1
worth	1
thy	1
sight	1
behold	1
Eastward	1
among	1
those	1
trees,	1
what	1
glorious	1
shape	1
Comes	1
this	1
way	1
moving;	1
seems	1
another	1
morn	1
Risen	1
on	1
mid-noon;	1
some	1
great	1
behest	1
from	1
Heaven	1
To	1
us	1
perhaps	1
he	1
brings,	1
and	1
will	1
vouchsafe	1
This	1
day	1
to	1
be	1
our	1
guest.	1
But	1
go	1
with	1
speed,	1
And,	1
what	1
thy	1
stores	1
contain,	1
bring	1
forth,	1
and	1
pour	1
Abundance,	1
fit	1
to	1
honour	1
and	1
receive	1
Our	1
heavenly	1
stranger:	1
Well	1
we	1
may	1
afford	1
Our	1
givers	1
their	1
own	1
gifts,	1
and	1
large	1
bestow	1
From	1
large	1
bestowed,	1
where	1
Nature	1
multiplies	1
Her	1
fertile	1
growth,	1
and	1
by	1
disburthening	1
grows	1
More	1
fruitful,	1
which	1
instructs	1
us	1
not	1
to	1
spare.	1
To	1
whom	1
thus	1
Eve.	1
Adam,	1
earth's	1
hallowed	1
mould,	1
Of	1
God	1
inspired!	1
small	1
store	1
will	1
serve,	1
where	1
store,	1
All	1
seasons,	1
ripe	1
for	1
use	1
hangs	1
on	1
the	1
stalk;	1
Save	1
what	1
by	1
frugal	1
storing	1
firmness	1
gains	1
To	1
nourish,	1
and	1
superfluous	1
moist	1
consumes:	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
haste,	1
and	1
from	1
each	1
bough	1
and	1
brake,	1
Each	1
plant	1
and	1
juciest	1
gourd,	1
will	1
pluck	1
such	1
choice	1
To	1
entertain	1
our	1
Angel-guest,	1
as	1
he	1
Beholding	1
shall	1
confess,	1
that	1
here	1
on	1
Earth	1
God	1
hath	1
dispensed	1
his	1
bounties	1
as	1
in	1
Heaven.	1
So	1
saying,	1
with	1
dispatchful	1
looks	1
in	1
haste	1
She	1
turns,	1
on	1
hospitable	1
thoughts	1
intent	1
What	1
choice	1
to	1
choose	1
for	1
delicacy	1
best,	1
What	1
order,	1
so	1
contrived	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
mix	1
Tastes,	1
not	1
well	1
joined,	1
inelegant,	1
but	1
bring	1
Taste	1
after	1
taste	1
upheld	1
with	1
kindliest	1
change;	1
Bestirs	1
her	1
then,	1
and	1
from	1
each	1
tender	1
stalk	1
Whatever	1
Earth,	1
all-bearing	1
mother,	1
yields	1
In	1
India	1
East	1
or	1
West,	1
or	1
middle	1
shore	1
In	1
Pontus	1
or	1
the	1
Punick	1

Alcinous	1

in	1
coat	1
Rough,	1
or	1
smooth	1

She	1
gathers,	1
tribute	1
large,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
board	1
Heaps	1
with	1
unsparing	1
hand;	1
for	1

the	1
grape	1
She	1
crushes,	1
inoffensive	1

From	1

dulcet	1
creams;	1
nor	1

Wants	1
her	1

pure;	1
then	1
strows	1
the	1
ground	1
With	1
rose	1
and	1
odours	1
from	1
the	1
shrub	1
unfumed.	1
Mean	1
while	1
our	1
primitive	1
great	1
sire,	1
to	1
meet	1
His	1
God-like	1
guest,	1
walks	1
forth,	1
without	1
more	1
train	1
Accompanied	1
than	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
complete	1
Perfections;	1
in	1
himself	1
was	1
all	1
his	1
state,	1
More	1
solemn	1
than	1
the	1
tedious	1
pomp	1
that	1
waits	1
On	1
princes,	1
when	1
their	1
rich	1
retinue	1
long	1
Of	1
horses	1
led,	1
and	1
grooms	1
besmeared	1
with	1
gold,	1
Dazzles	1
the	1
croud,	1
and	1
sets	1
them	1
all	1
agape.	1
Nearer	1
his	1
presence	1
Adam,	1
though	1
not	1
awed,	1
Yet	1
with	1
submiss	1
approach	1
and	1
reverence	1
meek,	1
As	1
to	1
a	1
superiour	1
nature	1
bowing	1
low,	1
Thus	1
said.	1
Native	1
of	1
Heaven,	1
for	1
other	1
place	1
None	1
can	1
than	1
Heaven	1
such	1
glorious	1
shape	1
contain;	1
Since,	1
by	1
descending	1
from	1
the	1
thrones	1
above,	1
Those	1
happy	1
places	1
thou	1
hast	1
deigned	1
a	1
while	1
To	1
want,	1
and	1
honour	1
these,	1
vouchsafe	1
with	1
us	1
Two	1
only,	1
who	1
yet	1
by	1
sovran	1
gift	1
possess	1
This	1
spacious	1
ground,	1
in	1
yonder	1
shady	1
bower	1
To	1
rest;	1
and	1
what	1
the	1
garden	1
choicest	1
bears	1
To	1
sit	1
and	1
taste,	1
till	1
this	1
meridian	1
heat	1
Be	1
over,	1
and	1
the	1
sun	1
more	1
cool	1
decline.	1
Whom	1
thus	1
the	1
angelick	1
Virtue	1
answered	1
mild.	1
Adam,	1
I	1
therefore	1
came;	1
nor	1
art	1
thou	1
such	1
Created,	1
or	1
such	1
place	1
hast	1
here	1
to	1
dwell,	1
As	1
may	1
not	1
oft	1
invite,	1
though	1
Spirits	1
of	1
Heaven,	1
To	1
visit	1
thee;	1
lead	1
on	1
then	1
where	1
thy	1
bower	1
O'ershades;	1
for	1
these	1
mid-hours,	1
till	1
evening	1
rise,	1
I	1
have	1
at	1
will.	1
So	1
to	1
the	1
sylvan	1
lodge	1
They	1
came,	1
that	1
like	1
Pomona's	1
arbour	1
smiled,	1
With	1
flowerets	1
decked,	1
and	1
fragrant	1
smells;	1
but	1
Eve,	1
Undecked	1
save	1
with	1
herself,	1
more	1
lovely	1
fair	1
Than	1
Wood-Nymph,	1
or	1
the	1
fairest	1
Goddess	1
feigned	1
Of	1
three	1
that	1
in	1
mount	1
Ida	1
naked	1
strove,	1
Stood	1
to	1
entertain	1
her	1
guest	1
from	1
Heaven;	1
no	1
veil	1
She	1
needed,	1
virtue-proof;	1
no	1
thought	1
infirm	1
Altered	1
her	1
cheek.	1
On	1
whom	1
the	1
Angel	1
Hail	1
Bestowed,	1
the	1
holy	1
salutation	1
used	1
Long	1
after	1
to	1
blest	1
Mary,	1
second	1
Eve.	1
Hail,	1
Mother	1
of	1
Mankind,	1
whose	1
fruitful	1
womb	1
Shall	1
fill	1
the	1
world	1
more	1
numerous	1
with	1
thy	1
sons,	1
Than	1
with	1
these	1
various	1
fruits	1
the	1
trees	1
of	1
God	1
Have	1
heaped	1
this	1
table!--Raised	1
of	1
grassy	1
turf	1
Their	1
table	1
was,	1
and	1
mossy	1
seats	1
had	1
round,	1
And	1
on	1
her	1
ample	1
square	1
from	1
side	1
to	1
side	1
All	1
autumn	1
piled,	1
though	1
spring	1
and	1
autumn	1
here	1
Danced	1
hand	1
in	1
hand.	1
A	1
while	1
discourse	1
they	1
hold;	1
No	1
fear	1
lest	1
dinner	1
cool;	1
when	1
thus	1
began	1
Our	1
author.	1
Heavenly	1
stranger,	1
please	1
to	1
taste	1
These	1
bounties,	1
which	1
our	1
Nourisher,	1
from	1
whom	1
All	1
perfect	1
good,	1
unmeasured	1
out,	1
descends,	1
To	1
us	1
for	1
food	1
and	1
for	1
delight	1
hath	1
caused	1
The	1
earth	1
to	1
yield;	1
unsavoury	1
food	1
perhaps	1
To	1
spiritual	1
natures;	1
only	1
this	1
I	1
know,	1
That	1
one	1
celestial	1
Father	1
gives	1
to	1
all.	1
To	1
whom	1
the	1
Angel.	1
Therefore	1
what	1
he	1
gives	1
(Whose	1
praise	1
be	1
ever	1
sung)	1
to	1
Man	1
in	1
part	1
Spiritual,	1
may	1
of	1
purest	1
Spirits	1
be	1
found	1
No	1
ingrateful	1
food:	1
And	1
food	1
alike	1
those	1
pure	1
Intelligential	1
substances	1
require,	1
As	1
doth	1
your	1
rational;	1
and	1
both	1
contain	1
Within	1
them	1
every	1
lower	1
faculty	1
Of	1
sense,	1
whereby	1
they	1
hear,	1
see,	1
smell,	1
touch,	1
taste,	1
Tasting	1
concoct,	1
digest,	1
assimilate,	1
And	1
corporeal	1
to	1
incorporeal	1
turn.	1
For	1
know,	1
whatever	1
was	1
created,	1
needs	1
To	1
be	1
sustained	1
and	1
fed:	1
Of	1
elements	1
The	1
grosser	1
feeds	1
the	1
purer,	1
earth	1
the	1
sea,	1
Earth	1
and	1
the	1
sea	1
feed	1
air,	1
the	1
air	1
those	1
fires	1
Ethereal,	1
and	1
as	1
lowest	1
first	1
the	1
moon;	1
Whence	1
in	1
her	1
visage	1
round	1
those	1
spots,	1
unpurged	1
Vapours	1
not	1
yet	1
into	1
her	1
substance	1
turned.	1
Nor	1
doth	1
the	1
moon	1
no	1
nourishment	1
exhale	1
From	1
her	1
moist	1
continent	1
to	1
higher	1
orbs.	1
The	1
sun	1
that	1
light	1
imparts	1
to	1
all,	1
receives	1
From	1
all	1
his	1
alimental	1
recompence	1
In	1
humid	1
exhalations,	1
and	1
at	1
even	1
Sups	1
with	1
the	1
ocean.	1
Though	1
in	1
Heaven	1
the	1
trees	1
Of	1
life	1
ambrosial	1
fruitage	1
bear,	1
and	1
vines	1
Yield	1
nectar;	1
though	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
boughs	1
each	1
morn	1
We	1
brush	1
mellifluous	1
dews,	1
and	1
find	1
the	1
ground	1
Covered	1
with	1
pearly	1
grain:	1
Yet	1
God	1
hath	1
here	1
Varied	1
his	1
bounty	1
so	1
with	1
new	1
delights,	1
As	1
may	1
compare	1
with	1
Heaven;	1
and	1
to	1
taste	1
Think	1
not	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
nice.	1
So	1
down	1
they	1
sat,	1
And	1
to	1
their	1
viands	1
fell;	1
nor	1
seemingly	1
The	1
Angel,	1
nor	1
in	1
mist,	1
the	1
common	1
gloss	1
Of	1
Theologians;	1
but	1
with	1
keen	1
dispatch	1
Of	1
real	1
hunger,	1
and	1
concoctive	1
heat	1
To	1
transubstantiate:	1
What	1
redounds,	1
transpires	1
Through	1
Spirits	1
with	1
ease;	1
nor	1
wonder;if	1
by	1
fire	1
Of	1
sooty	1
coal	1
the	1
empirick	1
alchemist	1
Can	1
turn,	1
or	1
holds	1
it	1
possible	1
to	1
turn,	1
Metals	1
of	1
drossiest	1
ore	1
to	1
perfect	1
gold,	1
As	1
from	1
the	1
mine.	1
Mean	1
while	1
at	1
table	1
Eve	1
Ministered	1
naked,	1
and	1
their	1
flowing	1
cups	1
With	1
pleasant	1
liquours	1
crowned:	1
O	1
innocence	1
Deserving	1
Paradise!	1
if	1
ever,	1
then,	1
Then	1
had	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
God	1
excuse	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
Enamoured	1
at	1
that	1
sight;	1
but	1
in	1
those	1
hearts	1
Love	1
unlibidinous	1
reigned,	1
nor	1
jealousy	1
Was	1
understood,	1
the	1
injured	1
lover's	1
hell.	1
Thus	1
when	1
with	1
meats	1
and	1
drinks	1
they	1
had	1
sufficed,	1
Not	1
burdened	1
nature,	1
sudden	1
mind	1
arose	1
In	1
Adam,	1
not	1
to	1
let	1
the	1
occasion	1
pass	1
Given	1
him	1
by	1
this	1
great	1
conference	1
to	1
know	1
Of	1
things	1
above	1
his	1
world,	1
and	1
of	1
their	1
being	1
Who	1
dwell	1
in	1
Heaven,	1
whose	1
excellence	1
he	1
saw	1
Transcend	1
his	1
own	1
so	1
far;	1
whose	1
radiant	1
forms,	1
Divine	1
effulgence,	1
whose	1
high	1
power,	1
so	1
far	1
Exceeded	1
human;	1
and	1
his	1
wary	1
speech	1
Thus	1
to	1
the	1
empyreal	1
minister	1
he	1
framed.	1
Inhabitant	1
with	1
God,	1
now	1
know	1
I	1
well	1
Thy	1
favour,	1
in	1
this	1
honour	1
done	1
to	1
Man;	1
Under	1
whose	1
lowly	1
roof	1
thou	1
hast	1
vouchsafed	1
To	1
enter,	1
and	1
these	1
earthly	1
fruits	1
to	1
taste,	1
Food	1
not	1
of	1
Angels,	1
yet	1
accepted	1
so,	1
As	1
that	1
more	1
willingly	1
thou	1
couldst	1
not	1
seem	1
At	1
Heaven's	1
high	1
feasts	1
to	1
have	1
fed:	1
yet	1
what	1
compare	1
To	1
whom	1
the	1
winged	1
Hierarch	1
replied.	1
O	1
Adam,	1
One	1
Almighty	1
is,	1
from	1
whom	1
All	1
things	1
proceed,	1
and	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
return,	1
If	1
not	1
depraved	1
from	1
good,	1
created	1
all	1
Such	1
to	1
perfection,	1
one	1
first	1
matter	1
all,	1
Endued	1
with	1
various	1
forms,	1
various	1
degrees	1
Of	1
substance,	1
and,	1
in	1
things	1
that	1
live,	1
of	1
life;	1
But	1
more	1
refined,	1
more	1
spiritous,	1
and	1
pure,	1
As	1
nearer	1
to	1
him	1
placed,	1
or	1
nearer	1
tending	1
Each	1
in	1

assigned,	1
Till	1
body	1
up	1
to	1
spirit	1
work,	1
in	1
bounds	1
Proportioned	1
to	1
each	1
kind.	1
So	1
from	1
the	1
root	1
Springs	1
lighter	1
the	1
green	1
stalk,	1
from	1
thence	1
the	1

More	1

the	1
bright	1

Spirits	1

flowers	1
and	1
their	1
fruit,	1
Man's	1
nourishment,	1
by	1
gradual	1
scale	1
sublimed,	1
To	1
vital	1
spirits	1
aspire,	1
to	1
animal,	1
To	1
intellectual;	1
give	1
both	1
life	1
and	1
sense,	1
Fancy	1
and	1
understanding;	1
whence	1
the	1
soul	1
Reason	1
receives,	1
and	1
reason	1
is	1
her	1
being,	1
Discursive,	1
or	1
intuitive;	1
discourse	1
Is	1
oftest	1
yours,	1
the	1
latter	1
most	1
is	1
ours,	1
Differing	1
but	1
in	1
degree,	1
of	1
kind	1
the	1
same.	1
Wonder	1
not	1
then,	1
what	1
God	1
for	1
you	1
saw	1
good	1
If	1
I	1
refuse	1
not,	1
but	1
convert,	1
as	1
you	1
To	1
proper	1
substance.	1
Time	1
may	1
come,	1
when	1
Men	1
With	1
Angels	1
may	1
participate,	1
and	1
find	1
No	1
inconvenient	1
diet,	1
nor	1
too	1
light	1
fare;	1
And	1
from	1
these	1
corporal	1
nutriments	1
perhaps	1
Your	1
bodies	1
may	1
at	1
last	1
turn	1
all	1
to	1
spirit,	1
Improved	1
by	1
tract	1
of	1
time,	1
and,	1
winged,	1
ascend	1
Ethereal,	1
as	1
we;	1
or	1
may,	1
at	1
choice,	1
Here	1
or	1
in	1
heavenly	1
Paradises	1
dwell;	1
If	1
ye	1
be	1
found	1
obedient,	1
and	1
retain	1
Unalterably	1
firm	1
his	1
love	1
entire,	1
Whose	1
progeny	1
you	1
are.	1
Mean	1
while	1
enjoy	1
Your	1
fill	1
what	1
happiness	1
this	1
happy	1
state	1
Can	1
comprehend,	1
incapable	1
of	1
more.	1
To	1
whom	1
the	1
patriarch	1
of	1
mankind	1
replied.	1
O	1
favourable	1
Spirit,	1
propitious	1
guest,	1
Well	1
hast	1
thou	1
taught	1
the	1
way	1
that	1
might	1
direct	1
Our	1
knowledge,	1
and	1
the	1
scale	1
of	1
nature	1
set	1
From	1
center	1
to	1
circumference;	1
whereon,	1
In	1
contemplation	1
of	1
created	1
things,	1
By	1
steps	1
we	1
may	1
ascend	1
to	1
God.	1
But	1
say,	1
What	1
meant	1
that	1
caution	1
joined,	1
If	1
ye	1
be	1
found	1
Obedient?	1
Can	1
we	1
want	1
obedience	1
then	1
To	1
him,	1
or	1
possibly	1
his	1
love	1
desert,	1
Who	1
formed	1
us	1
from	1
the	1
dust	1
and	1
placed	1
us	1
here	1
Full	1
to	1
the	1
utmost	1
measure	1
of	1
what	1
bliss	1
Human	1
desires	1
can	1
seek	1
or	1
apprehend?	1
To	1
whom	1
the	1
Angel.	1
Son	1
of	1
Heaven	1
and	1
Earth,	1
Attend!	1
That	1
thou	1
art	1
happy,	1
owe	1
to	1
God;	1
That	1
thou	1
continuest	1
such,	1
owe	1
to	1
thyself,	1
That	1
is,	1
to	1
thy	1
obedience;	1
therein	1
stand.	1
This	1
was	1
that	1
caution	1
given	1
thee;	1
be	1
advised.	1
God	1
made	1
thee	1
perfect,	1
not	1
immutable;	1
And	1
good	1
he	1
made	1
thee,	1
but	1
to	1
persevere	1
He	1
left	1
it	1
in	1
thy	1
power;	1
ordained	1
thy	1
will	1
By	1
nature	1
free,	1
not	1
over-ruled	1
by	1
fate	1
Inextricable,	1
or	1
strict	1
necessity:	1
Our	1
voluntary	1
service	1
he	1
requires,	1
Not	1
our	1
necessitated;	1
such	1
with	1
him	1
Finds	1
no	1
acceptance,	1
nor	1
can	1
find;	1
for	1
how	1
Can	1
hearts,	1
not	1
free,	1
be	1
tried	1
whether	1
they	1
serve	1
Willing	1
or	1
no,	1
who	1
will	1
but	1
what	1
they	1
must	1
By	1
destiny,	1
and	1
can	1
no	1
other	1
choose?	1
Myself,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
angelick	1
host,	1
that	1
stand	1
In	1
sight	1
of	1
God,	1
enthroned,	1
our	1
happy	1
state	1
Hold,	1
as	1
you	1
yours,	1
while	1
our	1
obedience	1
holds;	1
On	1
other	1
surety	1
none:	1
Freely	1
we	1
serve,	1
Because	1
we	1
freely	1
love,	1
as	1
in	1
our	1
will	1
To	1
love	1
or	1
not;	1
in	1
this	1
we	1
stand	1
or	1
fall:	1
And	1
some	1
are	1
fallen,	1
to	1
disobedience	1
fallen,	1
And	1
so	1
from	1
Heaven	1
to	1
deepest	1
Hell;	1
O	1
fall	1
From	1
what	1
high	1
state	1
of	1
bliss,	1
into	1
what	1
woe!	1
To	1
whom	1
our	1
great	1
progenitor.	1
Thy	1
words	1
Attentive,	1
and	1
with	1
more	1
delighted	1
ear,	1
Divine	1
instructer,	1
I	1
have	1
heard,	1
than	1
when	1
Cherubick	1
songs	1
by	1
night	1
from	1
neighbouring	1
hills	1
Aereal	1
musick	1
send:	1
Nor	1
knew	1
I	1
not	1
To	1
be	1
both	1
will	1
and	1
deed	1
created	1
free;	1
Yet	1
that	1
we	1
never	1
shall	1
forget	1
to	1
love	1
Our	1
Maker,	1
and	1
obey	1
him	1
whose	1
command	1
Single	1
is	1
yet	1
so	1
just,	1
my	1
constant	1
thoughts	1
Assured	1
me,	1
and	1
still	1
assure:	1
Though	1
what	1
thou	1
tellest	1
Hath	1
passed	1
in	1
Heaven,	1
some	1
doubt	1
within	1
me	1
move,	1
But	1
more	1
desire	1
to	1
hear,	1
if	1
thou	1
consent,	1
The	1
full	1
relation,	1
which	1
must	1
needs	1
be	1
strange,	1
Worthy	1
of	1
sacred	1
silence	1
to	1
be	1
heard;	1
And	1
we	1
have	1
yet	1
large	1
day,	1
for	1
scarce	1
the	1
sun	1
Hath	1
finished	1
half	1
his	1
journey,	1
and	1
scarce	1
begins	1
His	1
other	1
half	1
in	1
the	1
great	1
zone	1
of	1
Heaven.	1
Thus	1
Adam	1
made	1
request;	1
and	1
Raphael,	1
After	1
short	1
pause	1
assenting,	1
thus	1
began.	1
High	1
matter	1
thou	1
enjoinest	1
me,	1
O	1
prime	1
of	1
men,	1
Sad	1
task	1
and	1
hard:	1
For	1
how	1
shall	1
I	1
relate	1
To	1
human	1
sense	1
the	1
invisible	1
exploits	1
Of	1
warring	1
Spirits?	1
how,	1
without	1
remorse,	1
The	1
ruin	1
of	1
so	1
many	1
glorious	1
once	1
And	1
perfect	1
while	1
they	1
stood?	1
how	1
last	1
unfold	1
The	1
secrets	1
of	1
another	1
world,	1
perhaps	1
Not	1
lawful	1
to	1
reveal?	1
yet	1
for	1
thy	1
good	1
This	1
is	1
dispensed;	1
and	1
what	1
surmounts	1
the	1
reach	1
Of	1
human	1
sense,	1
I	1
shall	1
delineate	1
so,	1
By	1
likening	1
spiritual	1
to	1
corporal	1
forms,	1
As	1
may	1
express	1
them	1
best;	1
though	1
what	1
if	1
Earth	1
Be	1
but	1
a	1
shadow	1
of	1
Heaven,	1
and	1
things	1
therein	1
Each	1
to	1
other	1
like,	1
more	1
than	1
on	1
earth	1
is	1
thought?	1
As	1
yet	1
this	1
world	1
was	1
not,	1
and	1
Chaos	1
wild	1
Reigned	1
where	1
these	1
Heavens	1
now	1
roll,	1
where	1
Earth	1
now	1
rests	1
Upon	1
her	1
center	1
poised;	1
when	1
on	1
a	1
day	1
(For	1
time,	1
though	1
in	1
eternity,	1
applied	1
To	1
motion,	1
measures	1
all	1
things	1
durable	1
By	1
present,	1
past,	1
and	1
future,)	1
on	1
such	1
day	1
As	1
Heaven's	1
great	1
year	1
brings	1
forth,	1
the	1
empyreal	1
host	1
Of	1
Angels	1
by	1
imperial	1
summons	1
called,	1
Innumerable	1
before	1
the	1
Almighty's	1
throne	1
Forthwith,	1
from	1
all	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
Heaven,	1
appeared	1
Under	1
their	1
Hierarchs	1
in	1
orders	1
bright:	1
Ten	1
thousand	1
thousand	1
ensigns	1
high	1
advanced,	1
Standards	1
and	1
gonfalons	1
'twixt	1
van	1
and	1
rear	1
Stream	1
in	1
the	1
air,	1
and	1
for	1
distinction	1
serve	1
Of	1
hierarchies,	1
of	1
orders,	1
and	1
degrees;	1
Or	1
in	1
their	1
glittering	1
tissues	1
bear	1
imblazed	1
Holy	1
memorials,	1
acts	1
of	1
zeal	1
and	1
love	1
Recorded	1
eminent.	1
Thus	1
when	1
in	1
orbs	1
Of	1
circuit	1
inexpressible	1
they	1
stood,	1
Orb	1
within	1
orb,	1
the	1
Father	1
Infinite,	1
By	1
whom	1
in	1
bliss	1
imbosomed	1
sat	1
the	1
Son,	1
Amidst	1
as	1
from	1
a	1
flaming	1
mount,	1
whose	1
top	1
Brightness	1
had	1
made	1
invisible,	1
thus	1
spake.	1
Hear,	1
all	1
ye	1
Angels,	1
progeny	1
of	1
light,	1
Thrones,	1
Dominations,	1
Princedoms,	1
Virtues,	1
Powers;	1
Hear	1
my	1
decree,	1
which	1
unrevoked	1
shall	1
stand.	1
This	1
day	1
I	1
have	1
begot	1
whom	1
I	1
declare	1
My	1
only	1
Son,	1
and	1
on	1
this	1
holy	1
hill	1
Him	1
have	1
anointed,	1
whom	1
ye	1
now	1
behold	1
At	1
my	1
right	1
hand;	1
your	1
head	1
I	1
him	1
appoint;	1
And	1
by	1
myself	1
have	1
sworn,	1
to	1
him	1
shall	1
bow	1
All	1
knees	1
in	1
Heaven,	1
and	1
shall	1
confess	1
him	1
Lord:	1
Under	1
his	1
great	1
vice-gerent	1
reign	1
abide	1
United,	1
as	1
one	1
individual	1
soul,	1
For	1
ever	1
happy:	1
Him	1
who	1
disobeys,	1
Me	1
disobeys,	1
breaks	1
union,	1
and	1
that	1
day,	1
Cast	1
out	1
from	1
God	1
and	1
blessed	1
vision,	1
falls	1
Into	1
utter	1
darkness,	1
deep	1
ingulfed,	1
his	1
place	1
Ordained	1
without	1
redemption,	1
without	1
end.	1
So	1
spake	1
the	1
Omnipotent,	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
words	1
All	1
seemed	1
well	1
pleased;	1
all	1
seemed,	1
but	1
were	1
not	1
all.	1
That	1
day,	1
as	1
other	1
solemn	1
days,	1
they	1
spent	1
In	1
song	1
and	1
dance	1
about	1
the	1
sacred	1
hill;	1
Mystical	1
dance,	1
which	1
yonder	1
starry	1
sphere	1
Of	1
planets,	1
and	1
of	1
fixed,	1
in	1
all	1
her	1
wheels	1
Resembles	1
nearest,	1
mazes	1
intricate,	1
Eccentrick,	1
intervolved,	1
yet	1
regular	1
Then	1
most,	1
when	1
most	1
irregular	1
they	1
seem;	1
And	1
in	1
their	1
motions	1
harmony	1
divine	1
So	1
smooths	1
her	1
charming	1
tones,	1
that	1
God's	1
own	1
ear	1
Listens	1
delighted.	1
Evening	1
now	1
approached,	1
(For	1
we	1
have	1
also	1
our	1
evening	1
and	1
our	1
morn,	1
We	1
ours	1
for	1
change	1
delectable,	1
not	1
need;)	1
Forthwith	1
from	1
dance	1
to	1
sweet	1
repast	1
they	1
turn	1
Desirous;	1
all	1
in	1
circles	1
as	1
they	1
stood,	1
Tables	1
are	1
set,	1
and	1
on	1
a	1
sudden	1
piled	1
With	1
Angels	1
food,	1
and	1
rubied	1
nectar	1
flows	1
In	1
pearl,	1
in	1
diamond,	1
and	1
massy	1
gold,	1
Fruit	1
of	1
delicious	1
vines,	1
the	1
growth	1
of	1
Heaven.	1
On	1
flowers	1
reposed,	1
and	1
with	1
fresh	1
flowerets	1
crowned,	1
They	1
eat,	1
they	1
drink,	1
and	1
in	1
communion	1
sweet	1
Quaff	1
immortality	1
and	1
joy,	1
secure	1
Of	1
surfeit,	1
where	1
full	1
measure	1
only	1
bounds	1
Excess,	1
before	1
the	1
all-bounteous	1
King,	1
who	1
showered	1
With	1
copious	1
hand,	1
rejoicing	1
in	1
their	1
joy.	1
Now	1
when	1
ambrosial	1
night	1
with	1
clouds	1
exhaled	1
From	1
that	1
high	1
mount	1
of	1
God,	1
whence	1
light	1
and	1
shade	1
Spring	1
both,	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
brightest	1
Heaven	1
had	1
changed	1
To	1
grateful	1
twilight,	1
(for	1
night	1
comes	1
not	1
there	1
In	1
darker	1
veil,)	1
and	1
roseat	1
dews	1
disposed	1
All	1
but	1
the	1
unsleeping	1
eyes	1
of	1
God	1
to	1
rest;	1
Wide	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
plain,	1
and	1
wider	1
far	1
Than	1
all	1
this	1
globous	1
earth	1
in	1
plain	1
outspread,	1
(Such	1
are	1
the	1
courts	1
of	1
God)	1
the	1
angelick	1
throng,	1
Dispersed	1
in	1
bands	1
and	1
files,	1
their	1
camp	1
extend	1
By	1
living	1
streams	1
among	1
the	1
trees	1
of	1
life,	1
Pavilions	1
numberless,	1
and	1
sudden	1
reared,	1
Celestial	1
tabernacles,	1
where	1
they	1
slept	1
Fanned	1
with	1
cool	1
winds;	1
save	1
those,	1
who,	1
in	1
their	1
course,	1
Melodious	1
hymns	1
about	1
the	1
sovran	1
throne	1
Alternate	1
all	1
night	1
long:	1
but	1
not	1
so	1
waked	1
Satan;	1
so	1
call	1
him	1
now,	1
his	1
former	1
name	1
Is	1
heard	1
no	1
more	1
in	1
Heaven;	1
he	1
of	1
the	1
first,	1
If	1
not	1
the	1
first	1
Arch-Angel,	1
great	1
in	1
power,	1
In	1
favour	1
and	1
pre-eminence,	1
yet	1
fraught	1
With	1
envy	1
against	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God,	1
that	1
day	1
Honoured	1
by	1
his	1
great	1
Father,	1
and	1
proclaimed	1
Messiah	1
King	1
anointed,	1
could	1
not	1
bear	1
Through	1
pride	1
that	1
sight,	1
and	1
thought	1
himself	1
impaired.	1
Deep	1
malice	1
thence	1
conceiving	1
and	1
disdain,	1
Soon	1
as	1
midnight	1
brought	1
on	1
the	1
dusky	1
hour	1
Friendliest	1
to	1
sleep	1
and	1
silence,	1
he	1
resolved	1
With	1
all	1
his	1
legions	1
to	1
dislodge,	1
and	1
leave	1
Unworshipt,	1
unobeyed,	1
the	1
throne	1
supreme,	1
Contemptuous;	1
and	1
his	1
next	1
subordinate	1
Awakening,	1
thus	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
secret	1
spake.	1
Sleepest	1
thou,	1
Companion	1
dear?	1
What	1
sleep	1
can	1
close	1
Thy	1
eye-lids?	1
and	1
rememberest	1
what	1
decree	1
Of	1
yesterday,	1
so	1
late	1
hath	1
passed	1
the	1
lips	1
Of	1
Heaven's	1
Almighty.	1
Thou	1
to	1
me	1
thy	1
thoughts	1
Wast	1
wont,	1
I	1
mine	1
to	1
thee	1
was	1
wont	1
to	1
impart;	1
Both	1
waking	1
we	1
were	1
one;	1
how	1
then	1
can	1
now	1
Thy	1
sleep	1
dissent?	1
New	1
laws	1
thou	1
seest	1
imposed;	1
New	1
laws	1
from	1
him	1
who	1
reigns,	1
new	1
minds	1
may	1
raise	1
In	1
us	1
who	1
serve,	1
new	1
counsels	1
to	1
debate	1
What	1
doubtful	1
may	1
ensue:	1
More	1
in	1
this	1
place	1
To	1
utter	1
is	1
not	1
safe.	1
Assemble	1
thou	1
Of	1
all	1
those	1
myriads	1
which	1
we	1
lead	1
the	1
chief;	1
Tell	1
them,	1
that	1
by	1
command,	1
ere	1
yet	1
dim	1
night	1
Her	1
shadowy	1
cloud	1
withdraws,	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
haste,	1
And	1
all	1
who	1
under	1
me	1
their	1
banners	1
wave,	1
Homeward,	1
with	1
flying	1
march,	1
where	1
we	1
possess	1
The	1
quarters	1
of	1
the	1
north;	1
there	1
to	1
prepare	1
Fit	1
entertainment	1
to	1
receive	1
our	1
King,	1
The	1
great	1
Messiah,	1
and	1
his	1
new	1
commands,	1
Who	1
speedily	1
through	1
all	1
the	1
hierarchies	1
Intends	1
to	1
pass	1
triumphant,	1
and	1
give	1
laws.	1
So	1
spake	1
the	1
false	1
Arch-Angel,	1
and	1
infused	1
Bad	1
influence	1
into	1
the	1
unwary	1
breast	1
Of	1
his	1
associate:	1
He	1
together	1
calls,	1
Or	1
several	1
one	1
by	1
one,	1
the	1
regent	1
Powers,	1
Under	1
him	1
Regent;	1
tells,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
taught,	1
That	1
the	1
Most	1
High	1
commanding,	1
now	1
ere	1
night,	1
Now	1
ere	1
dim	1
night	1
had	1
disincumbered	1
Heaven,	1
The	1
great	1
hierarchal	1
standard	1
was	1
to	1
move;	1
Tells	1
the	1
suggested	1
cause,	1
and	1
casts	1
between	1
Ambiguous	1
words	1
and	1
jealousies,	1
to	1
sound	1
Or	1
taint	1
integrity:	1
But	1
all	1
obeyed	1
The	1
wonted	1
signal,	1
and	1
superiour	1
voice	1
Of	1
their	1
great	1
Potentate;	1
for	1
great	1
indeed	1
His	1
name,	1
and	1
high	1
was	1
his	1
degree	1
in	1
Heaven;	1
His	1
countenance,	1
as	1
the	1
morning-star	1
that	1
guides	1
The	1
starry	1
flock,	1
allured	1
them,	1
and	1
with	1
lies	1
Drew	1
after	1
him	1
the	1
third	1
part	1
of	1
Heaven's	1
host.	1
Mean	1
while	1
the	1
Eternal	1
eye,	1
whose	1
sight	1
discerns	1
Abstrusest	1
thoughts,	1
from	1
forth	1
his	1
holy	1
mount,	1
And	1
from	1
within	1
the	1
golden	1
lamps	1
that	1
burn	1
Nightly	1
before	1
him,	1
saw	1
without	1
their	1
light	1
Rebellion	1
rising;	1
saw	1
in	1
whom,	1
how	1
spread	1
Among	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
morn,	1
what	1
multitudes	1
Were	1
banded	1
to	1
oppose	1
his	1
high	1
decree;	1
And,	1
smiling,	1
to	1
his	1
only	1
Son	1
thus	1
said.	1
Son,	1
thou	1
in	1
whom	1
my	1
glory	1
I	1
behold	1
In	1
full	1
resplendence,	1
Heir	1
of	1
all	1
my	1
might,	1
Nearly	1
it	1
now	1
concerns	1
us	1
to	1
be	1
sure	1
Of	1
our	1
Omnipotence,	1
and	1
with	1
what	1
arms	1
We	1
mean	1
to	1
hold	1
what	1
anciently	1
we	1
claim	1
Of	1
deity	1
or	1
empire:	1
Such	1
a	1
foe	1
Is	1
rising,	1
who	1
intends	1
to	1
erect	1
his	1
throne	1
Equal	1
to	1
ours,	1
throughout	1
the	1
spacious	1
north;	1
Nor	1
so	1
content,	1
hath	1
in	1
his	1
thought	1
to	1
try	1
In	1
battle,	1
what	1
our	1
power	1
is,	1
or	1
our	1
right.	1
Let	1
us	1
advise,	1
and	1
to	1
this	1
hazard	1
draw	1
With	1
speed	1
what	1
force	1
is	1
left,	1
and	1
all	1
employ	1
In	1
our	1
defence;	1
lest	1
unawares	1
we	1
lose	1
This	1
our	1
high	1
place,	1
our	1
sanctuary,	1
our	1
hill.	1
To	1
whom	1
the	1
Son	1
with	1
calm	1
aspect	1
and	1
clear,	1
Lightning	1
divine,	1
ineffable,	1
serene,	1
Made	1
answer.	1
Mighty	1
Father,	1
thou	1
thy	1
foes	1
Justly	1
hast	1
in	1
derision,	1
and,	1
secure,	1
Laughest	1
at	1
their	1
vain	1
designs	1
and	1
tumults	1
vain,	1
Matter	1
to	1
me	1
of	1
glory,	1
whom	1
their	1
hate	1
Illustrates,	1
when	1
they	1
see	1
all	1
regal	1
power	1
Given	1
me	1
to	1
quell	1
their	1
pride,	1
and	1
in	1
event	1
Know	1
whether	1
I	1
be	1
dextrous	1
to	1
subdue	1
Thy	1
rebels,	1
or	1
be	1
found	1
the	1
worst	1
in	1
Heaven.	1
So	1
spake	1
the	1
Son;	1
but	1
Satan,	1
with	1
his	1
Powers,	1
Far	1
was	1
advanced	1
on	1
winged	1
speed;	1
an	1
host	1
Innumerable	1
as	1
the	1
stars	1
of	1
night,	1
Or	1
stars	1
of	1
morning,	1
dew-drops,	1
which	1
the	1
sun	1
Impearls	1
on	1
every	1
leaf	1
and	1
every	1
flower.	1
Regions	1
they	1
passed,	1
the	1
mighty	1
regencies	1
Of	1
Seraphim,	1
and	1
Potentates,	1
and	1
Thrones,	1
In	1
their	1
triple	1
degrees;	1
regions	1
to	1
which	1
All	1
thy	1
dominion,	1
Adam,	1
is	1
no	1
more	1
Than	1
what	1
this	1
garden	1
is	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
earth,	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
sea,	1
from	1
one	1
entire	1
globose	1
Stretched	1
into	1
longitude;	1
which	1
having	1
passed,	1
At	1
length	1
into	1
the	1
limits	1
of	1
the	1
north	1
They	1
came;	1
and	1
Satan	1
to	1
his	1
royal	1
seat	1
High	1
on	1
a	1
hill,	1
far	1
blazing,	1
as	1
a	1
mount	1
Raised	1
on	1
a	1
mount,	1
with	1
pyramids	1
and	1
towers	1
From	1
diamond	1
quarries	1
hewn,	1
and	1
rocks	1
of	1
gold;	1
The	1
palace	1
of	1
great	1
Lucifer,	1
(so	1
call	1
That	1
structure	1
in	1
the	1
dialect	1
of	1
men	1
Interpreted,)	1
which	1
not	1
long	1
after,	1
he	1
Affecting	1
all	1
equality	1
with	1
God,	1
In	1
imitation	1
of	1
that	1
mount	1
whereon	1
Messiah	1
was	1
declared	1
in	1
sight	1
of	1
Heaven,	1
The	1
Mountain	1
of	1
the	1
Congregation	1
called;	1
For	1
thither	1
he	1
assembled	1
all	1
his	1
train,	1
Pretending	1
so	1
commanded	1
to	1
consult	1
About	1
the	1
great	1
reception	1
of	1
their	1
King,	1
Thither	1
to	1
come,	1
and	1
with	1
calumnious	1
art	1
Of	1
counterfeited	1
truth	1
thus	1
held	1
their	1
ears.	1
Thrones,	1
Dominations,	1
Princedoms,	1
Virtues,	1
Powers;	1
If	1
these	1
magnifick	1
titles	1
yet	1
remain	1
Not	1
merely	1
titular,	1
since	1
by	1
decree	1
Another	1
now	1
hath	1
to	1
himself	1
engrossed	1
All	1
power,	1
and	1
us	1
eclipsed	1
under	1
the	1
name	1
Of	1
King	1
anointed,	1
for	1
whom	1
all	1
this	1
haste	1
Of	1
midnight-march,	1
and	1
hurried	1
meeting	1
here,	1
This	1
only	1
to	1
consult	1
how	1
we	1
may	1
best,	1
With	1
what	1
may	1
be	1
devised	1
of	1
honours	1
new,	1
Receive	1
him	1
coming	1
to	1
receive	1
from	1
us	1
Knee-tribute	1
yet	1
unpaid,	1
prostration	1
vile!	1
Too	1
much	1
to	1
one!	1
but	1
double	1
how	1
endured,	1
To	1
one,	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
image	1
now	1
proclaimed?	1
But	1
what	1
if	1
better	1
counsels	1
might	1
erect	1
Our	1
minds,	1
and	1
teach	1
us	1
to	1
cast	1
off	1
this	1
yoke?	1
Will	1
ye	1
submit	1
your	1
necks,	1
and	1
choose	1
to	1
bend	1
The	1
supple	1
knee?	1
Ye	1
will	1
not,	1
if	1
I	1
trust	1
To	1
know	1
ye	1
right,	1
or	1
if	1
ye	1
know	1
yourselves	1
Natives	1
and	1
sons	1
of	1
Heaven	1
possessed	1
before	1
By	1
none;	1
and	1
if	1
not	1
equal	1
all,	1
yet	1
free,	1
Equally	1
free;	1
for	1
orders	1
and	1
degrees	1
Jar	1
not	1
with	1
liberty,	1
but	1
well	1
consist.	1
Who	1
can	1
in	1
reason	1
then,	1
or	1
right,	1
assume	1
Monarchy	1
over	1
such	1
as	1
live	1
by	1
right	1
His	1
equals,	1
if	1
in	1
power	1
and	1
splendour	1
less,	1
In	1
freedom	1
equal?	1
or	1
can	1
introduce	1
Law	1
and	1
edict	1
on	1
us,	1
who	1
without	1
law	1
Err	1
not?	1
much	1
less	1
for	1
this	1
to	1
be	1
our	1
Lord,	1
And	1
look	1
for	1
adoration,	1
to	1
the	1
abuse	1
Of	1
those	1
imperial	1
titles,	1
which	1
assert	1
Our	1
being	1
ordained	1
to	1
govern,	1
not	1
to	1
serve.	1
Thus	1
far	1
his	1
bold	1
discourse	1
without	1
controul	1
Had	1
audience;	1
when	1
among	1
the	1
Seraphim	1
Abdiel,	1
than	1
whom	1
none	1
with	1
more	1
zeal	1
adored	1
The	1
Deity,	1
and	1
divine	1
commands	1
obeyed,	1
Stood	1
up,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
flame	1
of	1
zeal	1
severe	1
The	1
current	1
of	1
his	1
fury	1
thus	1
opposed.	1
O	1
argument	1
blasphemous,	1
false,	1
and	1
proud!	1
Words	1
which	1
no	1
ear	1
ever	1
to	1
hear	1
in	1
Heaven	1
Expected,	1
least	1
of	1
all	1
from	1
thee,	1
Ingrate,	1
In	1
place	1
thyself	1
so	1
high	1
above	1
thy	1
peers.	1
Canst	1
thou	1
with	1
impious	1
obloquy	1
condemn	1
The	1
just	1
decree	1
of	1
God,	1
pronounced	1
and	1
sworn,	1
That	1
to	1
his	1
only	1
Son,	1
by	1
right	1
endued	1
With	1
regal	1
scepter,	1
every	1
soul	1
in	1
Heaven	1
Shall	1
bend	1
the	1
knee,	1
and	1
in	1
that	1
honour	1
due	1
Confess	1
him	1
rightful	1
King?	1
unjust,	1
thou	1
sayest,	1
Flatly	1
unjust,	1
to	1
bind	1
with	1
laws	1
the	1
free,	1
And	1
equal	1
over	1
equals	1
to	1
let	1
reign,	1
One	1
over	1
all	1
with	1
unsucceeded	1
power.	1
Shalt	1
thou	1
give	1
law	1
to	1
God?	1
shalt	1
thou	1
dispute	1
With	1
him	1
the	1
points	1
of	1
liberty,	1
who	1
made	1
Thee	1
what	1
thou	1
art,	1
and	1
formed	1
the	1
Powers	1
of	1
Heaven	1
Such	1
as	1
he	1
pleased,	1
and	1
circumscribed	1
their	1
being?	1
Yet,	1
by	1
experience	1
taught,	1
we	1
know	1
how	1
good,	1
And	1
of	1
our	1
good	1
and	1
of	1
our	1
dignity	1
How	1
provident	1
he	1
is;	1
how	1
far	1
from	1
thought	1
To	1
make	1
us	1
less,	1
bent	1
rather	1
to	1
exalt	1
Our	1
happy	1
state,	1
under	1
one	1
head	1
more	1
near	1
United.	1
But	1
to	1
grant	1
it	1
thee	1
unjust,	1
That	1
equal	1
over	1
equals	1
monarch	1
reign:	1
Thyself,	1
though	1
great	1
and	1
glorious,	1
dost	1
thou	1
count,	1
Or	1
all	1
angelick	1
nature	1
joined	1
in	1
one,	1
Equal	1
to	1
him	1
begotten	1
Son?	1
by	1
whom,	1
As	1
by	1
his	1
Word,	1
the	1
Mighty	1
Father	1
made	1
All	1
things,	1
even	1
thee;	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
Spirits	1
of	1
Heaven	1
By	1
him	1
created	1
in	1
their	1
bright	1
degrees,	1
Crowned	1
them	1
with	1
glory,	1
and	1
to	1
their	1
glory	1
named	1
Thrones,	1
Dominations,	1
Princedoms,	1
Virtues,	1
Powers,	1
Essential	1
Powers;	1
nor	1
by	1
his	1
reign	1
obscured,	1
But	1
more	1
illustrious	1
made;	1
since	1
he	1
the	1
head	1
One	1
of	1
our	1
number	1
thus	1
reduced	1
becomes;	1
His	1
laws	1
our	1
laws;	1
all	1
honour	1
to	1
him	1
done	1
Returns	1
our	1
own.	1
Cease	1
then	1
this	1
impious	1
rage,	1
And	1
tempt	1
not	1
these;	1
but	1
hasten	1
to	1
appease	1
The	1
incensed	1
Father,	1
and	1
the	1
incensed	1
Son,	1
While	1
pardon	1
may	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
time	1
besought.	1
So	1
spake	1
the	1
fervent	1
Angel;	1
but	1
his	1
zeal	1
None	1
seconded,	1
as	1
out	1
of	1
season	1
judged,	1
Or	1
singular	1
and	1
rash:	1
Whereat	1
rejoiced	1
The	1
Apostate,	1
and,	1
more	1
haughty,	1
thus	1
replied.	1
That	1
we	1
were	1
formed	1
then	1
sayest	1
thou?	1
and	1
the	1
work	1
Of	1
secondary	1
hands,	1
by	1
task	1
transferred	1
From	1
Father	1
to	1
his	1
Son?	1
strange	1
point	1
and	1
new!	1
Doctrine	1
which	1
we	1
would	1
know	1
whence	1
learned:	1
who	1
saw	1
When	1
this	1
creation	1
was?	1
rememberest	1
thou	1
Thy	1
making,	1
while	1
the	1
Maker	1
gave	1
thee	1
being?	1
We	1
know	1
no	1
time	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
not	1
as	1
now;	1
Know	1
none	1
before	1
us,	1
self-begot,	1
self-raised	1
By	1
our	1
own	1
quickening	1
power,	1
when	1
fatal	1
course	1
Had	1
circled	1
his	1
full	1
orb,	1
the	1
birth	1
mature	1
Of	1
this	1
our	1
native	1
Heaven,	1
ethereal	1
sons.	1
Our	1
puissance	1
is	1
our	1
own;	1
our	1
own	1
right	1
hand	1
Shall	1
teach	1
us	1
highest	1
deeds,	1
by	1
proof	1
to	1
try	1
Who	1
is	1
our	1
equal:	1
Then	1
thou	1
shalt	1
behold	1
Whether	1
by	1
supplication	1
we	1
intend	1
Address,	1
and	1
to	1
begirt	1
the	1
almighty	1
throne	1
Beseeching	1
or	1
besieging.	1
This	1
report,	1
These	1
tidings	1
carry	1
to	1
the	1
anointed	1
King;	1
And	1
fly,	1
ere	1
evil	1
intercept	1
thy	1
flight.	1
He	1
said;	1
and,	1
as	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
waters	1
deep,	1
Hoarse	1
murmur	1
echoed	1
to	1
his	1
words	1
applause	1
Through	1
the	1
infinite	1
host;	1
nor	1
less	1
for	1
that	1
The	1
flaming	1
Seraph	1
fearless,	1
though	1
alone	1
Encompassed	1
round	1
with	1
foes,	1
thus	1
answered	1
bold.	1
O	1
alienate	1
from	1
God,	1
O	1
Spirit	1
accursed,	1
Forsaken	1
of	1
all	1
good!	1
I	1
see	1
thy	1
fall	1
Determined,	1
and	1
thy	1
hapless	1
crew	1
involved	1
In	1
this	1
perfidious	1
fraud,	1
contagion	1
spread	1
Both	1
of	1
thy	1
crime	1
and	1
punishment:	1
Henceforth	1
No	1
more	1
be	1
troubled	1
how	1
to	1
quit	1
the	1
yoke	1
Of	1
God's	1
Messiah;	1
those	1
indulgent	1
laws	1
Will	1
not	1
be	1
now	1
vouchsafed;	1
other	1
decrees	1
Against	1
thee	1
are	1
gone	1
forth	1
without	1
recall;	1
That	1
golden	1
scepter,	1
which	1
thou	1
didst	1
reject,	1
Is	1
now	1
an	1
iron	1
rod	1
to	1
bruise	1
and	1
break	1
Thy	1
disobedience.	1
Well	1
thou	1
didst	1
advise;	1
Yet	1
not	1
for	1
thy	1
advice	1
or	1
threats	1
I	1
fly	1
These	1
wicked	1
tents	1
devoted,	1
lest	1
the	1
wrath	1
Impendent,	1
raging	1
into	1
sudden	1
flame,	1
Distinguish	1
not:	1
For	1
soon	1
expect	1
to	1
feel	1
His	1
thunder	1
on	1
thy	1
head,	1
devouring	1
fire.	1
Then	1
who	1
created	1
thee	1
lamenting	1
learn,	1
When	1
who	1
can	1
uncreate	1
thee	1
thou	1
shalt	1
know.	1
So	1
spake	1
the	1
Seraph	1
Abdiel,	1

the	1

unpursued,	1
Through	1
Heaven's	1

champain	1
held	1
his	1

till	1

Waked	1
by	1
the	1
circling	1
Hours,	1
with	1
rosy	1
hand	1
Unbarred	1
the	1

of	1

There	1
is	1
a	1
cave	1
Within	1
the	1

of	1
God,	1
fast	1
by	1
his	1
throne,	1
Where	1
light	1
and	1
darkness	1
in	1

round	1
Lodge	1
and	1
dislodge	1
by	1

which	1

through	1

Obsequious	1

To	1

though	1

there	1
might	1
well	1
Seem	1
twilight	1
here:	1
And	1
now	1
went	1
forth	1
the	1
Morn	1
Such	1
as	1
in	1
highest	1
Heaven	1
arrayed	1
in	1
gold	1
Empyreal;	1
from	1
before	1
her	1
vanished	1
Night,	1
Shot	1
through	1
with	1
orient	1
beams;	1
when	1
all	1
the	1
plain	1
Covered	1
with	1
thick	1
embattled	1
squadrons	1
bright,	1
Chariots,	1
and	1
flaming	1
arms,	1
and	1
fiery	1
steeds,	1
Reflecting	1
blaze	1
on	1
blaze,	1
first	1
met	1
his	1
view:	1
War	1
he	1
perceived,	1
war	1
in	1
procinct;	1
and	1
found	1
Already	1
known	1
what	1
he	1
for	1
news	1
had	1
thought	1
To	1
have	1
reported:	1
Gladly	1
then	1
he	1
mixed	1
Among	1
those	1
friendly	1
Powers,	1
who	1
him	1
received	1
With	1
joy	1
and	1
acclamations	1
loud,	1
that	1
one,	1
That	1
of	1
so	1
many	1
myriads	1
fallen,	1
yet	1
one	1
Returned	1
not	1
lost.	1
On	1
to	1
the	1
sacred	1
hill	1
They	1
led	1
him	1
high	1
applauded,	1
and	1
present	1
Before	1
the	1
seat	1
supreme;	1
from	1
whence	1
a	1
voice,	1
From	1
midst	1
a	1
golden	1
cloud,	1
thus	1
mild	1
was	1
heard.	1
Servant	1
of	1
God.	1
Well	1
done;	1
well	1
hast	1
thou	1
fought	1
The	1
better	1
fight,	1
who	1
single	1
hast	1
maintained	1
Against	1
revolted	1
multitudes	1
the	1
cause	1
Of	1
truth,	1
in	1
word	1
mightier	1
than	1
they	1
in	1
arms;	1
And	1
for	1
the	1
testimony	1
of	1
truth	1
hast	1
borne	1
Universal	1
reproach,	1
far	1
worse	1
to	1
bear	1
Than	1
violence;	1
for	1
this	1
was	1
all	1
thy	1
care	1
To	1
stand	1
approved	1
in	1
sight	1
of	1
God,	1
though	1
worlds	1
Judged	1
thee	1
perverse:	1
The	1
easier	1
conquest	1
now	1
Remains	1
thee,	1
aided	1
by	1
this	1
host	1
of	1
friends,	1
Back	1
on	1
thy	1
foes	1
more	1
glorious	1
to	1
return,	1
Than	1
scorned	1
thou	1
didst	1
depart;	1
and	1
to	1
subdue	1
By	1
force,	1
who	1
reason	1
for	1
their	1
law	1
refuse,	1
Right	1
reason	1
for	1
their	1
law,	1
and	1
for	1
their	1
King	1
Messiah,	1
who	1
by	1
right	1
of	1
merit	1
reigns.	1
Go,	1
Michael,	1
of	1
celestial	1
armies	1
prince,	1
And	1
thou,	1
in	1
military	1
prowess	1
next,	1
Gabriel,	1
lead	1
forth	1
to	1
battle	1
these	1
my	1
sons	1
Invincible;	1
lead	1
forth	1
my	1
armed	1
Saints,	1
By	1
thousands	1
and	1
by	1
millions,	1
ranged	1
for	1
fight,	1
Equal	1
in	1
number	1
to	1
that	1
Godless	1
crew	1
Rebellious:	1
Them	1
with	1
fire	1
and	1
hostile	1
arms	1
Fearless	1
assault;	1
and,	1
to	1
the	1
brow	1
of	1
Heaven	1
Pursuing,	1
drive	1
them	1
out	1
from	1
God	1
and	1
bliss,	1
Into	1
their	1
place	1
of	1
punishment,	1
the	1
gulf	1
Of	1
Tartarus,	1
which	1
ready	1
opens	1
wide	1
His	1
fiery	1
Chaos	1
to	1
receive	1
their	1
fall.	1
So	1
spake	1
the	1
Sovran	1
Voice,	1
and	1
clouds	1
began	1
To	1
darken	1
all	1
the	1
hill,	1
and	1
smoke	1
to	1
roll	1
In	1
dusky	1
wreaths,	1
reluctant	1
flames,	1
the	1
sign	1
Of	1
wrath	1
awaked;	1
nor	1
with	1
less	1
dread	1
the	1
loud	1
Ethereal	1
trumpet	1
from	1
on	1
high	1
'gan	1
blow:	1
At	1
which	1
command	1
the	1
Powers	1
militant,	1
That	1
stood	1
for	1
Heaven,	1
in	1
mighty	1
quadrate	1
joined	1
Of	1
union	1
irresistible,	1
moved	1
on	1
In	1
silence	1
their	1
bright	1
legions,	1
to	1
the	1
sound	1
Of	1
instrumental	1
harmony,	1
that	1
breathed	1
Heroick	1
ardour	1
to	1
adventurous	1
deeds	1
Under	1
their	1
God-like	1
leaders,	1
in	1
the	1
cause	1
Of	1
God	1
and	1
his	1
Messiah.	1
On	1
they	1
move	1
Indissolubly	1
firm;	1
nor	1
obvious	1
hill,	1
Nor	1
straitening	1
vale,	1
nor	1
wood,	1
nor	1
stream,	1
divides	1
Their	1
perfect	1
ranks;	1
for	1
high	1
above	1
the	1
ground	1
Their	1
march	1
was,	1
and	1
the	1
passive	1
air	1
upbore	1
Their	1
nimble	1
tread;	1
as	1
when	1
the	1
total	1
kind	1
Of	1
birds,	1
in	1
orderly	1
array	1
on	1
wing,	1
Came	1
summoned	1
over	1
Eden	1
to	1
receive	1
Their	1
names	1
of	1
thee;	1
so	1
over	1
many	1
a	1
tract	1
Of	1
Heaven	1
they	1
marched,	1
and	1
many	1
a	1
province	1
wide,	1
Tenfold	1
the	1
length	1
of	1
this	1
terrene:	1
At	1
last,	1
Far	1
in	1
the	1
horizon	1
to	1
the	1
north	1
appeared	1
From	1
skirt	1
to	1
skirt	1
a	1
fiery	1
region,	1
stretched	1
In	1
battailous	1
aspect,	1
and	1
nearer	1
view	1
Bristled	1
with	1
upright	1
beams	1
innumerable	1
Of	1
rigid	1
spears,	1
and	1
helmets	1
thronged,	1
and	1
shields	1
Various,	1
with	1
boastful	1
argument	1
portrayed,	1
The	1
banded	1
Powers	1
of	1
Satan	1
hasting	1
on	1
With	1
furious	1
expedition;	1
for	1
they	1
weened	1
That	1
self-same	1
day,	1
by	1
fight	1
or	1
by	1
surprise,	1
To	1
win	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
on	1
his	1
throne	1
To	1
set	1
the	1
Envier	1
of	1
his	1
state,	1
the	1
proud	1
Aspirer;	1
but	1
their	1
thoughts	1
proved	1
fond	1
and	1
vain	1
In	1
the	1
mid	1
way:	1
Though	1
strange	1
to	1
us	1
it	1
seemed	1
At	1
first,	1
that	1
Angel	1
should	1
with	1
Angel	1
war,	1
And	1
in	1
fierce	1
hosting	1
meet,	1
who	1
wont	1
to	1
meet	1
So	1
oft	1
in	1
festivals	1
of	1
joy	1
and	1
love	1
Unanimous,	1
as	1
sons	1
of	1
one	1
great	1
Sire,	1
Hymning	1
the	1
Eternal	1
Father:	1
But	1
the	1
shout	1
Of	1
battle	1
now	1
began,	1
and	1
rushing	1
sound	1
Of	1
onset	1
ended	1
soon	1
each	1
milder	1
thought.	1
High	1
in	1
the	1
midst,	1
exalted	1
as	1
a	1
God,	1
The	1
Apostate	1
in	1
his	1
sun-bright	1
chariot	1
sat,	1
Idol	1
of	1
majesty	1
divine,	1
enclosed	1
With	1
flaming	1
Cherubim,	1
and	1
golden	1
shields;	1
Then	1
lighted	1
from	1
his	1
gorgeous	1
throne,	1
for	1
now	1
"twixt	1
host	1
and	1
host	1
but	1
narrow	1
space	1
was	1
left,	1
A	1
dreadful	1
interval,	1
and	1
front	1
to	1
front	1
Presented	1
stood	1
in	1
terrible	1
array	1
Of	1
hideous	1
length:	1
Before	1
the	1
cloudy	1
van,	1
On	1
the	1
rough	1
edge	1
of	1
battle	1
ere	1
it	1
joined,	1
Satan,	1
with	1
vast	1
and	1
haughty	1
strides	1
advanced,	1
Came	1
towering,	1
armed	1
in	1
adamant	1
and	1
gold;	1
Abdiel	1
that	1
sight	1
endured	1
not,	1
where	1
he	1
stood	1
Among	1
the	1
mightiest,	1
bent	1
on	1
highest	1
deeds,	1
And	1
thus	1
his	1
own	1
undaunted	1
heart	1
explores.	1
O	1
Heaven!	1
that	1
such	1
resemblance	1
of	1
the	1
Highest	1
Should	1
yet	1
remain,	1
where	1
faith	1
and	1
realty	1
Remain	1
not:	1
Wherefore	1
should	1
not	1
strength	1
and	1
might	1
There	1
fail	1
where	1
virtue	1
fails,	1
or	1
weakest	1
prove	1
Where	1
boldest,	1
though	1
to	1
fight	1
unconquerable?	1
His	1
puissance,	1
trusting	1
in	1
the	1
Almighty's	1
aid,	1
I	1
mean	1
to	1
try,	1
whose	1
reason	1
I	1
have	1
tried	1
Unsound	1
and	1
false;	1
nor	1
is	1
it	1
aught	1
but	1
just,	1
That	1
he,	1
who	1
in	1
debate	1
of	1
truth	1
hath	1
won,	1
Should	1
win	1
in	1
arms,	1
in	1
both	1
disputes	1
alike	1
Victor;	1
though	1
brutish	1
that	1
contest	1
and	1
foul,	1
When	1
reason	1
hath	1
to	1
deal	1
with	1
force,	1
yet	1
so	1
Most	1
reason	1
is	1
that	1
reason	1
overcome.	1
So	1
pondering,	1
and	1
from	1
his	1
armed	1
peers	1
Forth	1
stepping	1
opposite,	1
half-way	1
he	1
met	1
His	1
daring	1
foe,	1
at	1
this	1
prevention	1
more	1
Incensed,	1
and	1
thus	1
securely	1
him	1
defied.	1
Proud,	1
art	1
thou	1
met?	1
thy	1
hope	1
was	1
to	1
have	1
reached	1
The	1
highth	1
of	1
thy	1
aspiring	1
unopposed,	1
The	1
throne	1
of	1
God	1
unguarded,	1
and	1
his	1
side	1
Abandoned,	1
at	1
the	1
terrour	1
of	1
thy	1
power	1
Or	1
potent	1
tongue:	1
Fool!not	1
to	1
think	1
how	1
vain	1
Against	1
the	1
Omnipotent	1
to	1
rise	1
in	1
arms;	1
Who	1
out	1
of	1
smallest	1
things	1
could,	1
without	1
end,	1
Have	1
raised	1
incessant	1
armies	1
to	1
defeat	1
Thy	1
folly;	1
or	1
with	1
solitary	1
hand	1
Reaching	1
beyond	1
all	1
limit,	1
at	1
one	1
blow,	1
Unaided,	1
could	1
have	1
finished	1
thee,	1
and	1
whelmed	1
Thy	1
legions	1
under	1
darkness:	1
But	1
thou	1
seest	1
All	1
are	1
not	1
of	1
thy	1
train;	1
there	1
be,	1
who	1
faith	1
Prefer,	1
and	1
piety	1
to	1
God,	1
though	1
then	1
To	1
thee	1
not	1
visible,	1
when	1
I	1
alone	1
Seemed	1
in	1
thy	1
world	1
erroneous	1
to	1
dissent	1
From	1
all:	1
My	1
sect	1
thou	1
seest;now	1
learn	1
too	1
late	1
How	1
few	1
sometimes	1
may	1
know,	1
when	1
thousands	1
err.	1
Whom	1
the	1
grand	1
foe,	1
with	1
scornful	1
eye	1
askance,	1
Thus	1
answered.	1
Ill	1
for	1
thee,	1
but	1
in	1
wished	1
hour	1
Of	1
my	1
revenge,	1
first	1
sought	1
for,	1
thou	1
returnest	1
From	1
flight,	1
seditious	1
Angel!	1
to	1
receive	1
Thy	1
merited	1
reward,	1
the	1
first	1
assay	1
Of	1
this	1
right	1
hand	1
provoked,	1
since	1
first	1
that	1
tongue,	1
Inspired	1
with	1
contradiction,	1
durst	1
oppose	1
A	1
third	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
Gods,	1
in	1
synod	1
met	1
Their	1
deities	1
to	1
assert;	1
who,	1
while	1
they	1
feel	1
Vigour	1
divine	1
within	1
them,	1
can	1
allow	1
Omnipotence	1
to	1
none.	1
But	1
well	1
thou	1
comest	1
Before	1
thy	1
fellows,	1
ambitious	1
to	1
win	1
From	1
me	1
some	1
plume,	1
that	1
thy	1
success	1
may	1
show	1
Destruction	1
to	1
the	1
rest:	1
This	1
pause	1
between,	1
(Unanswered	1
lest	1
thou	1
boast)	1
to	1
let	1
thee	1
know,	1
At	1
first	1
I	1
thought	1
that	1
Liberty	1
and	1
Heaven	1
To	1
heavenly	1
souls	1
had	1
been	1
all	1
one;	1
but	1
now	1
I	1
see	1
that	1
most	1
through	1
sloth	1
had	1
rather	1
serve,	1
Ministring	1
Spirits,	1
trained	1
up	1
in	1
feast	1
and	1
song!	1
Such	1
hast	1
thou	1
armed,	1
the	1
minstrelsy	1
of	1
Heaven,	1
Servility	1
with	1
freedom	1
to	1
contend,	1
As	1
both	1
their	1
deeds	1
compared	1
this	1
day	1
shall	1
prove.	1
To	1
whom	1
in	1
brief	1
thus	1
Abdiel	1
stern	1
replied.	1
Apostate!	1
still	1
thou	1
errest,	1
nor	1
end	1
wilt	1
find	1
Of	1
erring,	1
from	1
the	1
path	1
of	1
truth	1
remote:	1
Unjustly	1
thou	1
depravest	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
name	1
Of	1
servitude,	1
to	1
serve	1
whom	1
God	1
ordains,	1
Or	1
Nature:	1
God	1
and	1
Nature	1
bid	1
the	1
same,	1
When	1
he	1
who	1
rules	1
is	1
worthiest,	1
and	1
excels	1
Them	1
whom	1
he	1
governs.	1
This	1
is	1
servitude,	1
To	1
serve	1
the	1
unwise,	1
or	1
him	1
who	1
hath	1
rebelled	1
Against	1
his	1
worthier,	1
as	1
thine	1
now	1
serve	1
thee,	1
Thyself	1
not	1
free,	1
but	1
to	1
thyself	1
enthralled;	1
Yet	1
lewdly	1
darest	1
our	1
ministring	1
upbraid.	1
Reign	1
thou	1
in	1
Hell,	1
thy	1
kingdom;	1
let	1
me	1
serve	1
In	1
Heaven	1
God	1
ever	1
blest,	1
and	1
his	1
divine	1
Behests	1
obey,	1
worthiest	1
to	1
be	1
obeyed;	1
Yet	1
chains	1
in	1
Hell,	1
not	1
realms,	1
expect:	1
Mean	1
while	1
From	1
me	1
returned,	1
as	1
erst	1
thou	1
saidst,	1
from	1
flight,	1
This	1
greeting	1
on	1
thy	1
impious	1
crest	1
receive.	1
So	1
saying,	1
a	1
noble	1
stroke	1
he	1
lifted	1
high,	1
Which	1
hung	1
not,	1
but	1
so	1
swift	1
with	1
tempest	1
fell	1
On	1
the	1
proud	1
crest	1
of	1
Satan,	1
that	1
no	1
sight,	1
Nor	1
motion	1
of	1
swift	1
thought,	1
less	1
could	1
his	1
shield,	1
Such	1
ruin	1
intercept:	1
Ten	1
paces	1
huge	1
He	1
back	1
recoiled;	1
the	1
tenth	1
on	1
bended	1
knee	1
His	1
massy	1
spear	1
upstaid;	1
as	1
if	1
on	1
earth	1
Winds	1
under	1
ground,	1
or	1
waters	1
forcing	1
way,	1
Sidelong	1
had	1
pushed	1
a	1
mountain	1
from	1
his	1
seat,	1
Half	1
sunk	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
pines.	1
Amazement	1
seised	1
The	1
rebel	1
Thrones,	1
but	1
greater	1
rage,	1
to	1
see	1
Thus	1
foiled	1
their	1
mightiest;	1
ours	1
joy	1
filled,	1
and	1
shout,	1
Presage	1
of	1
victory,	1
and	1
fierce	1
desire	1
Of	1
battle:	1
Whereat	1
Michael	1
bid	1
sound	1
The	1
Arch-Angel	1
trumpet;	1
through	1
the	1
vast	1
of	1
Heaven	1
It	1
sounded,	1
and	1
the	1
faithful	1
armies	1
rung	1
Hosanna	1
to	1
the	1
Highest:	1
Nor	1
stood	1
at	1
gaze	1
The	1
adverse	1
legions,	1
nor	1
less	1
hideous	1
joined	1
The	1
horrid	1
shock.	1
Now	1
storming	1
fury	1
rose,	1
And	1
clamour	1
such	1
as	1
heard	1
in	1
Heaven	1
till	1
now	1
Was	1
never;	1
arms	1
on	1
armour	1
clashing	1
brayed	1
Horrible	1
discord,	1
and	1
the	1
madding	1
wheels	1
Of	1
brazen	1
chariots	1
raged;	1
dire	1
was	1
the	1
noise	1
Of	1
conflict;	1
over	1
head	1
the	1
dismal	1
hiss	1
Of	1
fiery	1
darts	1
in	1
flaming	1
vollies	1
flew,	1
And	1
flying	1
vaulted	1
either	1
host	1
with	1
fire.	1
So	1
under	1
fiery	1
cope	1
together	1
rushed	1
Both	1
battles	1
main,	1
with	1
ruinous	1
assault	1
And	1
inextinguishable	1
rage.	1
All	1
Heaven	1
Resounded;	1
and	1
had	1
Earth	1
been	1
then,	1
all	1
Earth	1
Had	1
to	1
her	1
center	1
shook.	1
What	1
wonder?	1
when	1
Millions	1
of	1
fierce	1
encountering	1
Angels	1
fought	1
On	1
either	1
side,	1
the	1
least	1
of	1
whom	1
could	1
wield	1
These	1
elements,	1
and	1
arm	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
force	1
Of	1
all	1
their	1
regions:	1
How	1
much	1
more	1
of	1
power	1
Army	1
against	1
army	1
numberless	1
to	1
raise	1
Dreadful	1
combustion	1
warring,	1
and	1
disturb,	1
Though	1
not	1
destroy,	1
their	1
happy	1
native	1
seat;	1
Had	1
not	1
the	1
Eternal	1
King	1
Omnipotent,	1
From	1
his	1
strong	1
hold	1
of	1
Heaven,	1
high	1
over-ruled	1
And	1
limited	1
their	1
might;	1
though	1
numbered	1
such	1
As	1
each	1
divided	1
legion	1
might	1
have	1
seemed	1
A	1
numerous	1
host;	1
in	1
strength	1
each	1
armed	1
hand	1
A	1
legion;	1
led	1
in	1
fight,	1
yet	1
leader	1
seemed	1
Each	1

single	1
as	1

When	1
to	1
advance,	1
or	1
stand,	1
or	1
turn	1
the	1
sway	1
Of	1
battle,	1
open	1
when,	1
and	1
when	1
to	1
close	1
The	1
ridges	1
of	1
grim	1
war:	1
No	1
thought	1
of	1
flight,	1
None	1
of	1
retreat,	1
no	1
unbecoming	1
deed	1
That	1
argued	1
fear;	1
each	1
on	1
himself	1
relied,	1
As	1
only	1
in	1
his	1
arm	1
the	1
moment	1
lay	1
Of	1
victory:	1
Deeds	1
of	1
eternal	1
fame	1
Were	1
done,	1
but	1
infinite;	1
for	1
wide	1
was	1
spread	1
That	1
war	1
and	1
various;	1
sometimes	1
on	1
firm	1
ground	1
A	1
standing	1
fight,	1
then,	1
soaring	1
on	1
main	1
wing,	1
Tormented	1
all	1
the	1
air;	1
all	1
air	1
seemed	1
then	1
Conflicting	1
fire.	1
Long	1
time	1
in	1
even	1
scale	1
The	1
battle	1
hung;	1
till	1
Satan,	1
who	1
that	1
day	1
Prodigious	1
power	1
had	1
shown,	1
and	1
met	1
in	1
arms	1
No	1
equal,	1
ranging	1
through	1
the	1
dire	1
attack	1
Of	1
fighting	1
Seraphim	1
confused,	1
at	1
length	1
Saw	1
where	1
the	1
sword	1
of	1
Michael	1
smote,	1
and	1
felled	1
Squadrons	1
at	1
once;	1
with	1
huge	1
two-handed	1
sway	1
Brandished	1
aloft,	1
the	1
horrid	1
edge	1
came	1
down	1
Wide-wasting;	1
such	1
destruction	1
to	1
withstand	1
He	1
hasted,	1
and	1
opposed	1
the	1
rocky	1
orb	1
Of	1
tenfold	1
adamant,	1
his	1
ample	1
shield,	1
A	1
vast	1
circumference.	1
At	1
his	1
approach	1
The	1
great	1
Arch-Angel	1
from	1
his	1
warlike	1
toil	1
Surceased,	1
and	1
glad,	1
as	1
hoping	1
here	1
to	1
end	1
Intestine	1
war	1
in	1
Heaven,	1
the	1
arch-foe	1
subdued	1
Or	1
captive	1
dragged	1
in	1
chains,	1
with	1
hostile	1
frown	1
And	1
visage	1
all	1
inflamed	1
first	1
thus	1
began.	1
Author	1
of	1
evil,	1
unknown	1
till	1
thy	1
revolt,	1
Unnamed	1
in	1
Heaven,	1
now	1
plenteous	1
as	1
thou	1
seest	1
These	1
acts	1
of	1
hateful	1
strife,	1
hateful	1
to	1
all,	1
Though	1
heaviest	1
by	1
just	1
measure	1
on	1
thyself,	1
And	1
thy	1
adherents:	1
How	1
hast	1
thou	1
disturbed	1
Heaven's	1
blessed	1
peace,	1
and	1
into	1
nature	1
brought	1
Misery,	1
uncreated	1
till	1
the	1
crime	1
Of	1
thy	1
rebellion!	1
how	1
hast	1
thou	1
instilled	1
Thy	1
malice	1
into	1
thousands,	1
once	1
upright	1
And	1
faithful,	1
now	1
proved	1
false!	1
But	1
think	1
not	1
here	1
To	1
trouble	1
holy	1
rest;	1
Heaven	1
casts	1
thee	1
out	1
From	1
all	1
her	1
confines.	1
Heaven,	1
the	1
seat	1
of	1
bliss,	1
Brooks	1
not	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
violence	1
and	1
war.	1
Hence	1
then,	1
and	1
evil	1
go	1
with	1
thee	1
along,	1
Thy	1
offspring,	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
evil,	1
Hell;	1
Thou	1
and	1
thy	1
wicked	1
crew!	1
there	1
mingle	1
broils,	1
Ere	1
this	1
avenging	1
sword	1
begin	1
thy	1
doom,	1
Or	1
some	1
more	1
sudden	1
vengeance,	1
winged	1
from	1
God,	1
Precipitate	1
thee	1
with	1
augmented	1
pain.	1
So	1
spake	1
the	1
Prince	1
of	1
Angels;	1
to	1
whom	1
thus	1
The	1
Adversary.	1
Nor	1
think	1
thou	1
with	1
wind	1
Of	1
aery	1
threats	1
to	1
awe	1
whom	1
yet	1
with	1
deeds	1
Thou	1
canst	1
not.	1
Hast	1
thou	1
turned	1
the	1
least	1
of	1
these	1
To	1
flight,	1
or	1
if	1
to	1
fall,	1
but	1
that	1
they	1
rise	1
Unvanquished,	1
easier	1
to	1
transact	1
with	1
me	1
That	1
thou	1
shouldst	1
hope,	1
imperious,	1
and	1
with	1
threats	1
To	1
chase	1
me	1
hence?	1
err	1
not,	1
that	1
so	1
shall	1
end	1
The	1
strife	1
which	1
thou	1
callest	1
evil,	1
but	1
we	1
style	1
The	1
strife	1
of	1
glory;	1
which	1
we	1
mean	1
to	1
win,	1
Or	1
turn	1
this	1
Heaven	1
itself	1
into	1
the	1
Hell	1
Thou	1
fablest;	1
here	1
however	1
to	1
dwell	1
free,	1
If	1
not	1
to	1
reign:	1
Mean	1
while	1
thy	1
utmost	1
force,	1
And	1
join	1
him	1
named	1
Almighty	1
to	1
thy	1
aid,	1
I	1
fly	1
not,	1
but	1
have	1
sought	1
thee	1
far	1
and	1
nigh.	1
They	1
ended	1
parle,	1
and	1
both	1
addressed	1
for	1
fight	1
Unspeakable;	1
for	1
who,	1
though	1
with	1
the	1
tongue	1
Of	1
Angels,	1
can	1
relate,	1
or	1
to	1
what	1
things	1
Liken	1
on	1
earth	1
conspicuous,	1
that	1
may	1
lift	1
Human	1
imagination	1
to	1
such	1
highth	1
Of	1
Godlike	1
power?	1
for	1
likest	1
Gods	1
they	1
seemed,	1
Stood	1
they	1
or	1
moved,	1
in	1
stature,	1
motion,	1
arms,	1
Fit	1
to	1
decide	1
the	1
empire	1
of	1
great	1
Heaven.	1
Now	1
waved	1
their	1
fiery	1
swords,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
air	1
Made	1
horrid	1
circles;	1
two	1
broad	1
suns	1
their	1
shields	1
Blazed	1
opposite,	1
while	1
Expectation	1
stood	1
In	1
horrour:	1
From	1
each	1
hand	1
with	1
speed	1
retired,	1
Where	1
erst	1
was	1
thickest	1
fight,	1
the	1
angelick	1
throng,	1
And	1
left	1
large	1
field,	1
unsafe	1
within	1
the	1
wind	1
Of	1
such	1
commotion;	1
such	1
as,	1
to	1
set	1
forth	1
Great	1
things	1
by	1
small,	1
if,	1
nature's	1
concord	1
broke,	1
Among	1
the	1
constellations	1
war	1
were	1
sprung,	1
Two	1
planets,	1
rushing	1
from	1
aspect	1
malign	1
Of	1
fiercest	1
opposition,	1
in	1
mid	1
sky	1
Should	1
combat,	1
and	1
their	1
jarring	1
spheres	1
confound.	1
Together	1
both	1
with	1
next	1
to	1
almighty	1
arm	1
Up-lifted	1
imminent,	1
one	1
stroke	1
they	1
aimed	1
That	1
might	1
determine,	1
and	1
not	1
need	1
repeat,	1
As	1
not	1
of	1
power	1
at	1
once;	1
nor	1
odds	1
appeared	1
In	1
might	1
or	1
swift	1
prevention:	1
But	1
the	1
sword	1
Of	1
Michael	1
from	1
the	1
armoury	1
of	1
God	1
Was	1
given	1
him	1
tempered	1
so,	1
that	1
neither	1
keen	1
Nor	1
solid	1
might	1
resist	1
that	1
edge:	1
it	1
met	1
The	1
sword	1
of	1
Satan,	1
with	1
steep	1
force	1
to	1
smite	1
Descending,	1
and	1
in	1
half	1
cut	1
sheer;	1
nor	1
staid,	1
But	1
with	1
swift	1
wheel	1
reverse,	1
deep	1
entering,	1
shared	1
All	1
his	1
right	1
side:	1
Then	1
Satan	1
first	1
knew	1
pain,	1
And	1
writhed	1
him	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
convolved;	1
so	1
sore	1
The	1
griding	1
sword	1
with	1
discontinuous	1
wound	1
Passed	1
through	1
him:	1
But	1
the	1
ethereal	1
substance	1
closed,	1
Not	1
long	1
divisible;	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
gash	1
A	1
stream	1
of	1
necturous	1
humour	1
issuing	1
flowed	1
Sanguine,	1
such	1
as	1
celestial	1
Spirits	1
may	1
bleed,	1
And	1
all	1
his	1
armour	1
stained,	1
ere	1
while	1
so	1
bright.	1
Forthwith	1
on	1
all	1
sides	1
to	1
his	1
aid	1
was	1
run	1
By	1
Angels	1
many	1
and	1
strong,	1
who	1
interposed	1
Defence,	1
while	1
others	1
bore	1
him	1
on	1
their	1
shields	1
Back	1
to	1
his	1
chariot,	1
where	1
it	1
stood	1
retired	1
From	1
off	1
the	1
files	1
of	1
war:	1
There	1
they	1
him	1
laid	1
Gnashing	1
for	1
anguish,	1
and	1
despite,	1
and	1
shame,	1
To	1
find	1
himself	1
not	1
matchless,	1
and	1
his	1
pride	1
Humbled	1
by	1
such	1
rebuke,	1
so	1
far	1
beneath	1
His	1
confidence	1
to	1
equal	1
God	1
in	1
power.	1
Yet	1
soon	1
he	1
healed;	1
for	1
Spirits	1
that	1
live	1
throughout	1
Vital	1
in	1
every	1
part,	1
not	1
as	1
frail	1
man	1
In	1
entrails,	1
heart	1
of	1
head,	1
liver	1
or	1
reins,	1
Cannot	1
but	1
by	1
annihilating	1
die;	1
Nor	1
in	1
their	1
liquid	1
texture	1
mortal	1
wound	1
Receive,	1
no	1
more	1
than	1
can	1
the	1
fluid	1
air:	1
All	1
heart	1
they	1
live,	1
all	1
head,	1
all	1
eye,	1
all	1
ear,	1
All	1
intellect,	1
all	1
sense;	1
and,	1
as	1
they	1
please,	1
They	1
limb	1
themselves,	1
and	1
colour,	1

or	1
size	1
Assume,	1
as?kikes	1

condense	1
or	1
rare.	1
Mean	1
while	1
in	1
other	1
parts	1
like	1
deeds	1
deserved	1
Memorial,	1
where	1
the	1
might	1
of	1
Gabriel	1
fought,	1
And	1
with	1
fierce	1
ensigns	1
pierced	1
the	1
deep	1
array	1
Of	1
Moloch,	1
furious	1
king;	1
who	1
him	1
defied,	1
And	1
at	1
his	1
chariot-wheels	1
to	1
drag	1
him	1
bound	1
Threatened,	1
nor	1
from	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
Heaven	1
Refrained	1
his	1
tongue	1
blasphemous;	1
but	1
anon	1
Down	1
cloven	1
to	1
the	1
waist,	1
with	1
shattered	1
arms	1
And	1
uncouth	1
pain	1
fled	1
bellowing.	1
On	1
each	1
wing	1
Uriel,	1
and	1
Raphael,	1
his	1
vaunting	1
foe,	1
Though	1
huge,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
rock	1
of	1
diamond	1
armed,	1
Vanquished	1
Adramelech,	1
and	1
Asmadai,	1
Two	1
potent	1
Thrones,	1
that	1
to	1
be	1
less	1
than	1
Gods	1
Disdained,	1
but	1
meaner	1
thoughts	1
learned	1
in	1
their	1
flight,	1
Mangled	1
with	1
ghastly	1
wounds	1
through	1
plate	1
and	1
mail.	1
Nor	1
stood	1
unmindful	1
Abdiel	1
to	1
annoy	1
The	1
atheist	1
crew,	1
but	1
with	1
redoubled	1
blow	1
Ariel,	1
and	1
Arioch,	1
and	1
the	1
violence	1
Of	1
Ramiel	1
scorched	1
and	1
blasted,	1
overthrew.	1
I	1
might	1
relate	1
of	1
thousands,	1
and	1
their	1
names	1
Eternize	1
here	1
on	1
earth;	1
but	1
those	1
elect	1
Angels,	1
contented	1
with	1
their	1
fame	1
in	1
Heaven,	1
Seek	1
not	1
the	1
praise	1
of	1
men:	1
The	1
other	1
sort,	1
In	1
might	1
though	1
wonderous	1
and	1
in	1
acts	1
of	1
war,	1
Nor	1
of	1
renown	1
less	1
eager,	1
yet	1
by	1
doom	1
Cancelled	1
from	1
Heaven	1
and	1
sacred	1
memory,	1
Nameless	1
in	1
dark	1
oblivion	1
let	1
them	1
dwell.	1
For	1
strength	1
from	1
truth	1
divided,	1
and	1
from	1
just,	1
Illaudable,	1
nought	1
merits	1
but	1
dispraise	1
And	1
ignominy;	1
yet	1
to	1
glory	1
aspires	1
Vain-glorious,	1
and	1
through	1
infamy	1
seeks	1
fame:	1
Therefore	1
eternal	1
silence	1
be	1
their	1
doom.	1
And	1
now,	1
their	1
mightiest	1
quelled,	1
the	1
battle	1
swerved,	1
With	1
many	1
an	1
inroad	1
gored;	1
deformed	1
rout	1
Entered,	1
and	1
foul	1
disorder;	1
all	1
the	1
ground	1
With	1
shivered	1
armour	1
strown,	1
and	1
on	1
a	1
heap	1
Chariot	1
and	1
charioteer	1
lay	1
overturned,	1
And	1
fiery-foaming	1
steeds;	1
what	1
stood,	1
recoiled	1
O'er-wearied,	1
through	1
the	1
faint	1
Satanick	1
host	1
Defensive	1
scarce,	1
or	1
with	1
pale	1
fear	1
surprised,	1
Then	1
first	1
with	1
fear	1
surprised,	1
and	1
sense	1
of	1
pain,	1
Fled	1
ignominious,	1
to	1
such	1
evil	1
brought	1
By	1
sin	1
of	1
disobedience;	1
till	1
that	1
hour	1
Not	1
liable	1
to	1
fear,	1
or	1
flight,	1
or	1
pain.	1
Far	1
otherwise	1
the	1
inviolable	1
Saints,	1
In	1
cubick	1
phalanx	1
firm,	1
advanced	1
entire,	1
Invulnerable,	1
impenetrably	1
armed;	1
Such	1
high	1
advantages	1
their	1
innocence	1
Gave	1
them	1
above	1
their	1
foes;	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
sinned,	1
Not	1
to	1
have	1
disobeyed;	1
in	1
fight	1
they	1
stood	1
Unwearied,	1
unobnoxious	1
to	1
be	1
pained	1
By	1
wound,	1
though	1
from	1
their	1
place	1
by	1
violence	1
moved,	1
Now	1
Night	1
her	1
course	1
began,	1
and,	1
over	1
Heaven	1
Inducing	1
darkness,	1
grateful	1
truce	1
imposed,	1
And	1
silence	1
on	1
the	1
odious	1
din	1
of	1
war:	1
Under	1
her	1
cloudy	1
covert	1
both	1
retired,	1
Victor	1
and	1
vanquished:	1
On	1
the	1
foughten	1
field	1
Michael	1
and	1
his	1
Angels	1
prevalent	1
Encamping,	1
placed	1
in	1
guard	1
their	1
watches	1
round,	1
Cherubick	1
waving	1
fires:	1
On	1
the	1
other	1
part,	1
Satan	1
with	1
his	1
rebellious	1
disappeared,	1
Far	1
in	1
the	1
dark	1
dislodged;	1
and,	1
void	1
of	1
rest,	1
His	1
potentates	1
to	1
council	1
called	1
by	1
night;	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
thus	1
undismayed	1
began.	1
O	1
now	1
in	1
danger	1
tried,	1
now	1
known	1
in	1
arms	1
Not	1
to	1
be	1
overpowered,	1
Companions	1
dear,	1
Found	1
worthy	1
not	1
of	1
liberty	1
alone,	1
Too	1
mean	1
pretence!	1
but	1
what	1
we	1
more	1
affect,	1
Honour,	1
dominion,	1
glory,	1
and	1
renown;	1
Who	1
have	1
sustained	1
one	1
day	1
in	1
doubtful	1
fight,	1
(And	1
if	1
one	1
day,	1
why	1
not	1
eternal	1
days?)	1
What	1
Heaven's	1
Lord	1
had	1
powerfullest	1
to	1
send	1
Against	1
us	1
from	1
about	1
his	1
throne,	1
and	1
judged	1
Sufficient	1
to	1
subdue	1
us	1
to	1
his	1
will,	1
But	1
proves	1
not	1
so:	1
Then	1
fallible,	1
it	1
seems,	1
Of	1
future	1
we	1
may	1
deem	1
him,	1
though	1
till	1
now	1
Omniscient	1
thought.	1
True	1
is,	1
less	1
firmly	1
armed,	1
Some	1
disadvantage	1
we	1
endured	1
and	1
pain,	1
Till	1
now	1
not	1
known,	1
but,	1
known,	1
as	1
soon	1
contemned;	1
Since	1
now	1
we	1
find	1
this	1
our	1
empyreal	1
form	1
Incapable	1
of	1
mortal	1
injury,	1
Imperishable,	1
and,	1
though	1
pierced	1
with	1
wound,	1
Soon	1
closing,	1
and	1
by	1
native	1
vigour	1
healed.	1
Of	1
evil	1
then	1
so	1
small	1
as	1
easy	1
think	1
The	1
remedy;	1
perhaps	1
more	1
valid	1
arms,	1
Weapons	1
more	1
violent,	1
when	1
next	1
we	1
meet,	1
May	1
serve	1
to	1
better	1
us,	1
and	1
worse	1
our	1
foes,	1
Or	1
equal	1
what	1
between	1
us	1
made	1
the	1
odds,	1
In	1
nature	1
none:	1
If	1
other	1
hidden	1
cause	1
Left	1
them	1
superiour,	1
while	1
we	1
can	1
preserve	1
Unhurt	1
our	1
minds,	1
and	1
understanding	1
sound,	1
Due	1
search	1
and	1
consultation	1
will	1
disclose.	1
He	1
sat;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
assembly	1
next	1
upstood	1
Nisroch,	1
of	1
Principalities	1
the	1
prime;	1
As	1
one	1
he	1
stood	1
escaped	1
from	1
cruel	1
fight,	1
Sore	1
toiled,	1
his	1
riven	1
arms	1
to	1
havock	1
hewn,	1
And	1
cloudy	1
in	1
aspect	1
thus	1
answering	1
spake.	1
Deliverer	1
from	1
new	1
Lords,	1
leader	1
to	1
free	1
Enjoyment	1
of	1
our	1
right	1
as	1
Gods;	1
yet	1
hard	1
For	1
Gods,	1
and	1
too	1
unequal	1
work	1
we	1
find,	1
Against	1
unequal	1
arms	1
to	1
fight	1
in	1
pain,	1
Against	1
unpained,	1
impassive;	1
from	1
which	1
evil	1
Ruin	1
must	1
needs	1
ensue;	1
for	1
what	1
avails	1
Valour	1
or	1
strength,	1
though	1
matchless,	1
quelled	1
with	1
pain	1
Which	1
all	1
subdues,	1
and	1
makes	1
remiss	1
the	1
hands	1
Of	1
mightiest?	1
Sense	1
of	1
pleasure	1
we	1
may	1
well	1
Spare	1
out	1
of	1
life	1
perhaps,	1
and	1
not	1
repine,	1
But	1
live	1
content,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
calmest	1
life:	1
But	1
pain	1
is	1
perfect	1
misery,	1
the	1
worst	1
Of	1
evils,	1
and,	1
excessive,	1
overturns	1
All	1
patience.	1
He,	1
who	1
therefore	1
can	1
invent	1
With	1
what	1
more	1
forcible	1
we	1
may	1
offend	1
Our	1
yet	1
unwounded	1
enemies,	1
or	1
arm	1
Ourselves	1
with	1
like	1
defence,	1
to	1
me	1
deserves	1
No	1
less	1
than	1
for	1
deliverance	1
what	1
we	1
owe.	1
Whereto	1
with	1
look	1
composed	1
Satan	1
replied.	1
Not	1
uninvented	1
that,	1
which	1
thou	1
aright	1
Believest	1
so	1
main	1
to	1
our	1
success,	1
I	1
bring.	1
Which	1
of	1
us	1
who	1
beholds	1
the	1
bright	1
surface	1
Of	1
this	1
ethereous	1
mould	1
whereon	1
we	1
stand,	1
This	1
continent	1
of	1
spacious	1
Heaven,	1
adorned	1
With	1
plant,	1
fruit,	1
flower	1
ambrosial,	1
gems,	1
and	1
gold;	1
Whose	1
eye	1
so	1
superficially	1
surveys	1
These	1
things,	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
mind	1
from	1
whence	1
they	1
grow	1
Deep	1
under	1
ground,	1
materials	1
dark	1
and	1
crude,	1
Of	1
spiritous	1
and	1
fiery	1
spume,	1
till	1
touched	1
With	1
Heaven's	1
ray,	1
and	1
tempered,	1
they	1
shoot	1
forth	1
So	1
beauteous,	1
opening	1
to	1
the	1
ambient	1
light?	1
These	1
in	1
their	1
dark	1
nativity	1
the	1
deep	1
Shall	1
yield	1
us,	1
pregnant	1
with	1
infernal	1
flame;	1
Which,	1
into	1
hollow	1
engines,	1
long	1
and	1
round,	1
Thick	1
rammed,	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
bore	1
with	1
touch	1
of	1
fire	1
Dilated	1
and	1
infuriate,	1
shall	1
send	1
forth	1
From	1
far,	1
with	1
thundering	1
noise,	1
among	1
our	1
foes	1
Such	1
implements	1
of	1
mischief,	1
as	1
shall	1
dash	1
To	1
pieces,	1
and	1
o'erwhelm	1
whatever	1
stands	1
Adverse,	1
that	1
they	1
shall	1
fear	1
we	1
have	1
disarmed	1
The	1
Thunderer	1
of	1
his	1
only	1
dreaded	1
bolt.	1
Nor	1
long	1
shall	1
be	1
our	1
labour;	1
yet	1
ere	1
dawn,	1
Effect	1
shall	1
end	1
our	1
wish.	1
Mean	1
while	1
revive;	1
Abandon	1
fear;	1
to	1
strength	1
and	1
counsel	1
joined	1
Think	1
nothing	1
hard,	1
much	1
less	1
to	1
be	1
despaired.	1
He	1
ended,	1
and	1
his	1
words	1
their	1
drooping	1
cheer	1
Enlightened,	1
and	1
their	1
languished	1
hope	1
revived.	1
The	1
invention	1
all	1
admired,	1
and	1
each,	1
how	1
he	1
To	1
be	1
the	1
inventer	1
missed;	1
so	1
easy	1
it	1
seemed	1
Once	1
found,	1
which	1
yet	1
unfound	1
most	1
would	1
have	1
thought	1
Impossible:	1
Yet,	1
haply,	1
of	1
thy	1
race	1
In	1
future	1
days,	1
if	1
malice	1
should	1
abound,	1
Some	1
one	1
intent	1
on	1
mischief,	1
or	1
inspired	1
With	1
devilish	1
machination,	1
might	1
devise	1
Like	1
instrument	1
to	1
plague	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
men	1
For	1
sin,	1
on	1
war	1
and	1
mutual	1
slaughter	1
bent.	1
Forthwith	1
from	1
council	1
to	1
the	1
work	1
they	1
flew;	1
None	1
arguing	1
stood;	1
innumerable	1
hands	1
Were	1
ready;	1
in	1
a	1
moment	1
up	1
they	1
turned	1
Wide	1
the	1
celestial	1
soil,	1
and	1
saw	1
beneath	1
The	1
originals	1
of	1
nature	1
in	1
their	1
crude	1
Conception;	1
sulphurous	1
and	1
nitrous	1
foam	1
They	1
found,	1
they	1
mingled,	1
and,	1
with	1
subtle	1
art,	1
Concocted	1
and	1
adusted	1
they	1
reduced	1
To	1
blackest	1
grain,	1
and	1
into	1
store	1
conveyed:	1
Part	1
hidden	1
veins	1
digged	1
up	1
(nor	1
hath	1
this	1
earth	1
Entrails	1
unlike)	1
of	1
mineral	1
and	1
stone,	1
Whereof	1
to	1
found	1
their	1
engines	1
and	1
their	1
balls	1
Of	1
missive	1
ruin;	1
part	1
incentive	1
reed	1
Provide,	1
pernicious	1
with	1
one	1
touch	1
to	1
fire.	1
So	1
all	1
ere	1
day-spring,	1
under	1
conscious	1
night,	1
Secret	1
they	1
finished,	1
and	1
in	1
order	1
set,	1
With	1
silent	1
circumspection,	1
unespied.	1
Now	1
when	1
fair	1
morn	1
orient	1
in	1
Heaven	1
appeared,	1
Up	1
rose	1
the	1
victor-Angels,	1
and	1
to	1
arms	1
The	1
matin	1
trumpet	1
sung:	1
In	1
arms	1
they	1
stood	1
Of	1
golden	1
panoply,	1
refulgent	1
host,	1
Soon	1
banded;	1
others	1
from	1
the	1
dawning	1
hills	1
Look	1
round,	1
and	1
scouts	1
each	1
coast	1
light-armed	1
scour,	1
Each	1
quarter	1
to	1
descry	1
the	1
distant	1
foe,	1
Where	1
lodged,	1
or	1
whither	1
fled,	1
or	1
if	1
for	1
fight,	1
In	1
motion	1
or	1
in	1
halt:	1
Him	1
soon	1
they	1
met	1
Under	1
spread	1
ensigns	1
moving	1
nigh,	1
in	1
slow	1
But	1
firm	1
battalion;	1
back	1
with	1
speediest	1
sail	1
Zophiel,	1
of	1
Cherubim	1
the	1
swiftest	1
wing,	1
Came	1
flying,	1
and	1
in	1
mid	1
air	1
aloud	1
thus	1
cried.	1
Arm,	1
Warriours,	1
arm	1
for	1
fight;	1
the	1
foe	1
at	1
hand,	1
Whom	1
fled	1
we	1
thought,	1
will	1
save	1
us	1
long	1
pursuit	1
This	1
day;	1
fear	1
not	1
his	1
flight;so	1
thick	1
a	1
cloud	1
He	1
comes,	1
and	1
settled	1
in	1
his	1
face	1
I	1
see	1
Sad	1
resolution,	1
and	1
secure:	1
Let	1
each	1
His	1
adamantine	1
coat	1
gird	1
well,	1
and	1
each	1
Fit	1
well	1
his	1
helm,	1
gripe	1
fast	1
his	1
orbed	1
shield,	1
Borne	1
even	1
or	1
high;	1
for	1
this	1
day	1
will	1
pour	1
down,	1
If	1
I	1
conjecture	1
aught,	1
no	1
drizzling	1
shower,	1
But	1
rattling	1
storm	1
of	1
arrows	1
barbed	1
with	1
fire.	1
So	1
warned	1
he	1
them,	1
aware	1
themselves,	1
and	1
soon	1
In	1
order,	1
quit	1
of	1
all	1
impediment;	1
Instant	1
without	1
disturb	1
they	1
took	1
alarm,	1
And	1
onward	1
moved	1
embattled:	1
When	1
behold!	1
Not	1
distant	1
far	1
with	1
heavy	1
pace	1
the	1
foe	1
Approaching	1
gross	1
and	1
huge,	1
in	1
hollow	1
cube	1
Training	1
his	1
devilish	1
enginery,	1
impaled	1
On	1
every	1
side	1
with	1
shadowing	1
squadrons	1
deep,	1
To	1
hide	1
the	1
fraud.	1
At	1
interview	1
both	1
stood	1
A	1
while;	1
but	1
suddenly	1
at	1
head	1
appeared	1
Satan,	1
and	1
thus	1
was	1
heard	1
commanding	1
loud.	1
Vanguard,	1
to	1
right	1
and	1
left	1
the	1
front	1
unfold;	1
That	1
all	1
may	1
see	1
who	1
hate	1
us,	1
how	1
we	1
seek	1
Peace	1
and	1
composure,	1
and	1
with	1
open	1
breast	1
Stand	1
ready	1
to	1
receive	1
them,	1
if	1
they	1
like	1
Our	1
overture;	1
and	1
turn	1
not	1
back	1
perverse:	1
But	1
that	1
I	1
doubt;	1
however	1
witness,	1
Heaven!	1
Heaven,	1
witness	1
thou	1
anon!	1
while	1
we	1
discharge	1
Freely	1
our	1
part:	1
ye,	1
who	1
appointed	1
stand	1
Do	1
as	1
you	1
have	1
in	1
charge,	1
and	1
briefly	1
touch	1
What	1
we	1
propound,	1
and	1
loud	1
that	1
all	1
may	1
hear!	1
So	1
scoffing	1
in	1
ambiguous	1
words,	1
he	1
scarce	1
Had	1
ended;	1
when	1
to	1
right	1
and	1
left	1
the	1
front	1
Divided,	1
and	1
to	1
either	1
flank	1
retired:	1
Which	1
to	1
our	1
eyes	1
discovered,	1
new	1
and	1
strange,	1
A	1
triple	1
mounted	1
row	1
of	1
pillars	1
laid	1
On	1
wheels	1
(for	1
like	1
to	1
pillars	1
most	1
they	1
seemed,	1
Or	1
hollowed	1
bodies	1
made	1
of	1
oak	1
or	1
fir,	1
With	1
branches	1
lopt,	1
in	1
wood	1
or	1
mountain	1
felled,)	1
Brass,	1
iron,	1
stony	1
mould,	1
had	1
not	1
their	1
mouths	1
With	1
hideous	1
orifice	1
gaped	1
on	1
us	1
wide,	1
Portending	1
hollow	1
truce:	1
At	1
each	1
behind	1
A	1
Seraph	1
stood,	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
a	1
reed	1
Stood	1
waving	1
tipt	1
with	1
fire;	1
while	1
we,	1
suspense,	1
Collected	1
stood	1
within	1
our	1
thoughts	1
amused,	1
Not	1
long;	1
for	1
sudden	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
their	1
reeds	1
Put	1
forth,	1
and	1
to	1
a	1
narrow	1
vent	1
applied	1
With	1
nicest	1
touch.	1
Immediate	1
in	1
a	1
flame,	1
But	1
soon	1
obscured	1
with	1
smoke,	1
all	1
Heaven	1
appeared,	1
From	1
those	1
deep-throated	1
engines	1
belched,	1
whose	1
roar	1
Embowelled	1
with	1
outrageous	1
noise	1
the	1
air,	1
And	1
all	1
her	1
entrails	1
tore,	1
disgorging	1
foul	1
Their	1
devilish	1
glut,	1
chained	1
thunderbolts	1
and	1
hail	1
Of	1
iron	1
globes;	1
which,	1
on	1
the	1
victor	1
host	1
Levelled,	1
with	1
such	1
impetuous	1
fury	1
smote,	1
That,	1
whom	1
they	1
hit,	1
none	1
on	1
their	1
feet	1
might	1
stand,	1
Though	1
standing	1
else	1
as	1
rocks,	1
but	1
down	1
they	1
fell	1
By	1
thousands,	1
Angel	1
on	1
Arch-Angel	1
rolled;	1
The	1
sooner	1
for	1
their	1
arms;	1
unarmed,	1
they	1
might	1
Have	1
easily,	1
as	1
Spirits,	1
evaded	1
swift	1
By	1
quick	1
contraction	1
or	1
remove;	1
but	1
now	1
Foul	1
dissipation	1
followed,	1
and	1
forced	1
rout;	1
Nor	1
served	1
it	1
to	1
relax	1
their	1
serried	1
files.	1
What	1
should	1
they	1
do?	1
if	1
on	1
they	1
rushed,	1
repulse	1
Repeated,	1
and	1
indecent	1
overthrow	1
Doubled,	1
would	1
render	1
them	1
yet	1
more	1
despised,	1
And	1
to	1
their	1
foes	1
a	1
laughter;	1
for	1
in	1
view	1
Stood	1
ranked	1
of	1
Seraphim	1
another	1
row,	1
In	1
posture	1
to	1
displode	1
their	1
second	1
tire	1
Of	1
thunder:	1
Back	1
defeated	1
to	1
return	1
They	1
worse	1
abhorred.	1
Satan	1
beheld	1
their	1
plight,	1
And	1
to	1
his	1
mates	1
thus	1
in	1
derision	1
called.	1
O	1
Friends!	1
why	1
come	1
not	1
on	1
these	1
victors	1
proud	1
Ere	1
while	1
they	1
fierce	1
were	1
coming;	1
and	1
when	1
we,	1
To	1
entertain	1
them	1
fair	1
with	1
open	1
front	1
And	1
breast,	1
(what	1
could	1
we	1
more?)	1
propounded	1
terms	1
Of	1
composition,	1
straight	1
they	1
changed	1
their	1
minds,	1
Flew	1
off,	1
and	1
into	1
strange	1
vagaries	1
fell,	1
As	1
they	1
would	1
dance;	1
yet	1
for	1
a	1
dance	1
they	1
seemed	1
Somewhat	1
extravagant	1
and	1
wild;	1
perhaps	1
For	1
joy	1
of	1
offered	1
peace:	1
But	1
I	1
suppose,	1
If	1
our	1
proposals	1
once	1
again	1
were	1
heard,	1
We	1
should	1
compel	1
them	1
to	1
a	1
quick	1
result.	1
To	1
whom	1
thus	1
Belial,	1
in	1
like	1
gamesome	1
mood.	1
Leader!	1
the	1
terms	1
we	1
sent	1
were	1
terms	1
of	1
weight,	1
Of	1
hard	1
contents,	1
and	1
full	1
of	1
force	1
urged	1
home;	1
Such	1
as	1
we	1
might	1
perceive	1
amused	1
them	1
all,	1
And	1
stumbled	1
many:	1
Who	1
receives	1
them	1
right,	1
Had	1
need	1
from	1
head	1
to	1
foot	1
well	1
understand;	1
Not	1
understood,	1
this	1
gift	1
they	1
have	1
besides,	1
They	1
show	1
us	1
when	1
our	1
foes	1
walk	1
not	1
upright.	1
So	1
they	1
among	1
themselves	1
in	1
pleasant	1
vein	1
Stood	1
scoffing,	1
hightened	1
in	1
their	1
thoughts	1
beyond	1
All	1
doubt	1
of	1
victory:	1
Eternal	1
Might	1
To	1
match	1
with	1
their	1
inventions	1
they	1
presumed	1
So	1
easy,	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
thunder	1
made	1
a	1
scorn,	1
And	1
all	1
his	1
host	1
derided,	1
while	1
they	1
stood	1
A	1
while	1
in	1
trouble:	1
But	1
they	1
stood	1
not	1
long;	1
Rage	1
prompted	1
them	1
at	1
length,	1
and	1
found	1
them	1
arms	1
Against	1
such	1
hellish	1
mischief	1
fit	1
to	1
oppose.	1
Forthwith	1
(behold	1
the	1
excellence,	1
the	1
power,	1
Which	1
God	1
hath	1
in	1
his	1
mighty	1
Angels	1
placed!)	1
Their	1
arms	1
away	1
they	1
threw,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
hills	1
(For	1
Earth	1
hath	1
this	1
variety	1
from	1
Heaven	1
Of	1
pleasure	1
situate	1
in	1
hill	1
and	1
dale,)	1
Light	1
as	1
the	1
lightning	1
glimpse	1
they	1
ran,	1
they	1
flew;	1
From	1
their	1
foundations	1
loosening	1
to	1
and	1
fro,	1
They	1
plucked	1
the	1
seated	1
hills,	1
with	1
all	1
their	1
load,	1
Rocks,	1
waters,	1
woods,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
shaggy	1
tops	1
Up-lifting	1
bore	1
them	1
in	1
their	1
hands:	1
Amaze,	1
Be	1
sure,	1
and	1
terrour,	1
seized	1
the	1
rebel	1
host,	1
When	1
coming	1
towards	1
them	1
so	1
dread	1
they	1
saw	1
The	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
mountains	1
upward	1
turned;	1
Till	1
on	1
those	1
cursed	1
engines'	1
triple-row	1
They	1
saw	1
them	1
whelmed,	1
and	1
all	1
their	1
confidence	1
Under	1
the	1
weight	1
of	1
mountains	1
buried	1
deep;	1
Themselves	1
invaded	1
next,	1
and	1
on	1
their	1
heads	1
Main	1
promontories	1
flung,	1
which	1
in	1
the	1
air	1
Came	1
shadowing,	1
and	1
oppressed	1
whole	1
legions	1
armed;	1
Their	1
armour	1
helped	1
their	1
harm,	1
crushed	1
in	1
and	1
bruised	1
Into	1
their	1
substance	1
pent,	1
which	1
wrought	1
them	1
pain	1
Implacable,	1
and	1
many	1
a	1
dolorous	1
groan;	1
Long	1
struggling	1
underneath,	1
ere	1
they	1
could	1
wind	1
Out	1
of	1
such	1
prison,	1
though	1
Spirits	1
of	1
purest	1
light,	1
Purest	1
at	1
first,	1
now	1
gross	1
by	1
sinning	1
grown.	1
The	1
rest,	1
in	1
imitation,	1
to	1
like	1
arms	1
Betook	1
them,	1
and	1
the	1
neighbouring	1
hills	1
uptore:	1
So	1
hills	1
amid	1
the	1
air	1
encountered	1
hills,	1
Hurled	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
with	1
jaculation	1
dire;	1
That	1
under	1
ground	1
they	1
fought	1
in	1
dismal	1
shade;	1
Infernal	1
noise!	1
war	1
seemed	1
a	1
civil	1
game	1
To	1
this	1
uproar;	1
horrid	1
confusion	1
heaped	1
Upon	1
confusion	1
rose:	1
And	1
now	1
all	1
Heaven	1
Had	1
gone	1
to	1
wrack,	1
with	1
ruin	1
overspread;	1
Had	1
not	1
the	1
Almighty	1
Father,	1
where	1
he	1
sits	1
Shrined	1
in	1
his	1
sanctuary	1
of	1
Heaven	1
secure,	1
Consulting	1
on	1
the	1
sum	1
of	1
things,	1
foreseen	1
This	1
tumult,	1
and	1
permitted	1
all,	1
advised:	1
That	1
his	1
great	1
purpose	1
he	1
might	1
so	1
fulfil,	1
To	1
honour	1
his	1
anointed	1
Son	1
avenged	1
Upon	1
his	1
enemies,	1
and	1
to	1
declare	1
All	1
power	1
on	1
him	1
transferred:	1
Whence	1
to	1
his	1
Son,	1
The	1
Assessour	1
of	1
his	1
throne,	1
he	1
thus	1
began.	1
Effulgence	1
of	1
my	1
glory,	1
Son	1
beloved,	1
Son,	1
in	1
whose	1
face	1
invisible	1
is	1
beheld	1
Visibly,	1
what	1
by	1
Deity	1
I	1
am;	1
And	1
in	1
whose	1
hand	1
what	1
by	1
decree	1
I	1
do,	1
Second	1
Omnipotence!	1
two	1
days	1
are	1
past,	1
Two	1
days,	1
as	1
we	1
compute	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Heaven,	1
Since	1
Michael	1
and	1
his	1
Powers	1
went	1
forth	1
to	1
tame	1
These	1
disobedient:	1
Sore	1
hath	1
been	1
their	1
fight,	1
As	1
likeliest	1
was,	1
when	1
two	1
such	1
foes	1
met	1
armed;	1
For	1
to	1
themselves	1
I	1
left	1
them;	1
and	1
thou	1
knowest,	1
Equal	1
in	1
their	1
creation	1
they	1
were	1
formed,	1
Save	1
what	1
sin	1
hath	1
impaired;	1
which	1
yet	1
hath	1
wrought	1
Insensibly,	1
for	1
I	1
suspend	1
their	1
doom;	1
Whence	1
in	1
perpetual	1
fight	1
they	1
needs	1
must	1
last	1
Endless,	1
and	1
no	1
solution	1
will	1
be	1
found:	1
War	1
wearied	1
hath	1
performed	1
what	1
war	1
can	1
do,	1
And	1
to	1
disordered	1
rage	1
let	1
loose	1
the	1
reins	1
With	1
mountains,	1
as	1
with	1
weapons,	1
armed;	1
which	1
makes	1
Wild	1
work	1
in	1
Heaven,	1
and	1
dangerous	1
to	1
the	1
main.	1
Two	1
days	1
are	1
therefore	1
past,	1
the	1
third	1
is	1
thine;	1
For	1
thee	1
I	1
have	1
ordained	1
it;	1
and	1
thus	1
far	1
Have	1
suffered,	1
that	1
the	1
glory	1
may	1
be	1
thine	1
Of	1
ending	1
this	1
great	1
war,	1
since	1
none	1
but	1
Thou	1
Can	1
end	1
it.	1
Into	1
thee	1
such	1
virtue	1
and	1
grace	1
Immense	1
I	1
have	1
transfused,	1
that	1
all	1
may	1
know	1
In	1
Heaven	1
and	1
Hell	1
thy	1
power	1
above	1
compare;	1
And,	1
this	1
perverse	1
commotion	1
governed	1
thus,	1
To	1
manifest	1
thee	1
worthiest	1
to	1
be	1
Heir	1
Of	1
all	1
things;	1
to	1
be	1
Heir,	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
King	1
By	1
sacred	1
unction,	1
thy	1
deserved	1
right.	1
Go	1
then,	1
Thou	1
Mightiest,	1
in	1
thy	1
Father's	1
might;	1
Ascend	1
my	1
chariot,	1
guide	1
the	1
rapid	1
wheels	1
That	1
shake	1
Heaven's	1
basis,	1
bring	1
forth	1
all	1
my	1
war,	1
My	1
bow	1
and	1
thunder,	1
my	1
almighty	1
arms	1
Gird	1
on,	1
and	1
sword	1
upon	1
thy	1
puissant	1
thigh;	1
Pursue	1
these	1
sons	1
of	1
darkness,	1
drive	1
them	1
out	1
From	1
all	1
Heaven's	1
bounds	1
into	1
the	1
utter	1
deep:	1
There	1
let	1
them	1
learn,	1
as	1
likes	1
them,	1
to	1
despise	1
God,	1
and	1
Messiah	1
his	1
anointed	1
King.	1
He	1
said,	1
and	1
on	1
his	1
Son	1
with	1
rays	1
direct	1
Shone	1
full;	1
he	1
all	1
his	1
Father	1
full	1
expressed	1
Ineffably	1
into	1
his	1
face	1
received;	1
And	1
thus	1
the	1
Filial	1
Godhead	1
answering	1
spake.	1
O	1
Father,	1
O	1
Supreme	1
of	1
heavenly	1
Thrones,	1
First,	1
Highest,	1
Holiest,	1
Best;	1
thou	1
always	1
seek'st	1
To	1
glorify	1
thy	1
Son,	1
I	1
always	1
thee,	1
As	1
is	1
most	1
just:	1
This	1
I	1
my	1
glory	1
account,	1
My	1
exaltation,	1
and	1
my	1
whole	1
delight,	1
That	1
thou,	1
in	1
me	1
well	1
pleased,	1
declarest	1
thy	1
will	1
Fulfilled,	1
which	1
to	1
fulfil	1
is	1
all	1
my	1
bliss.	1
Scepter	1
and	1
power,	1
thy	1
giving,	1
I	1
assume,	1
And	1
gladlier	1
shall	1
resign,	1
when	1
in	1
the	1
end	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
all	1
in	1
all,	1
and	1
I	1
in	1
thee	1
For	1
ever;	1
and	1
in	1
me	1
all	1
whom	1
thou	1
lovest:	1
But	1
whom	1
thou	1
hatest,	1
I	1
hate,	1
and	1
can	1
put	1
on	1
Thy	1
terrours,	1
as	1
I	1
put	1
thy	1
mildness	1
on,	1
Image	1
of	1
thee	1
in	1
all	1
things;	1
and	1
shall	1
soon,	1
Armed	1
with	1
thy	1
might,	1
rid	1
Heaven	1
of	1
these	1
rebelled;	1
To	1
their	1
prepared	1
ill	1
mansion	1
driven	1
down,	1
To	1
chains	1
of	1
darkness,	1
and	1
the	1
undying	1
worm;	1
That	1
from	1
thy	1
just	1
obedience	1
could	1
revolt,	1
Whom	1
to	1
obey	1
is	1
happiness	1
entire.	1
Then	1
shall	1
thy	1
Saints	1
unmixed,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
impure	1
Far	1
separate,	1
circling	1
thy	1
holy	1
mount,	1
Unfeigned	1
Halleluiahs	1
to	1
thee	1
sing,	1
Hymns	1
of	1
high	1
praise,	1
and	1
I	1
among	1
them	1
Chief.	1
So	1
said,	1
he,	1
o'er	1
his	1
scepter	1
bowing,	1
rose	1
From	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
Glory	1
where	1
he	1
sat;	1
And	1
the	1
third	1
sacred	1
morn	1
began	1
to	1
shine,	1
Dawning	1
through	1
Heaven.	1
Forth	1
rushed	1
with	1
whirlwind	1
sound	1
The	1
chariot	1
of	1
Paternal	1
Deity,	1
Flashing	1
thick	1
flames,	1
wheel	1
within	1
wheel	1
undrawn,	1
Itself	1
instinct	1
with	1
Spirit,	1
but	1
convoyed	1
By	1
four	1
Cherubick	1
shapes;	1
four	1
faces	1
each	1
Had	1
wonderous;	1
as	1
with	1
stars,	1
their	1
bodies	1
all	1
And	1
wings	1
were	1
set	1
with	1
eyes;	1
with	1
eyes	1
the	1
wheels	1
Of	1
beryl,	1
and	1
careering	1
fires	1
between;	1
Over	1
their	1
heads	1
a	1
crystal	1
firmament,	1
Whereon	1
a	1
sapphire	1
throne,	1
inlaid	1
with	1
pure	1
Amber,	1
and	1
colours	1
of	1
the	1
showery	1
arch.	1
He,	1
in	1
celestial	1
panoply	1
all	1
armed	1
Of	1
radiant	1
Urim,	1
work	1
divinely	1
wrought,	1
Ascended;	1
at	1
his	1
right	1
hand	1
Victory	1
Sat	1
eagle-winged;	1
beside	1
him	1
hung	1
his	1
bow	1
And	1
quiver	1
with	1
three-bolted	1
thunder	1
stored;	1
And	1
from	1
about	1
him	1
fierce	1
effusion	1
rolled	1
Of	1
smoke,	1
and	1
bickering	1
flame,	1
and	1
sparkles	1
dire:	1
Attended	1
with	1
ten	1
thousand	1
thousand	1
Saints,	1
He	1
onward	1
came;	1
far	1
off	1
his	1
coming	1
shone;	1
And	1
twenty	1
thousand	1
(I	1
their	1
number	1
heard)	1
Chariots	1
of	1
God,	1
half	1
on	1
each	1
hand,	1
were	1
seen;	1
He	1
on	1
the	1
wings	1
of	1
Cherub	1
rode	1
sublime	1
On	1
the	1
crystalline	1
sky,	1
in	1
sapphire	1
throned,	1
Illustrious	1
far	1
and	1
wide;	1
but	1
by	1
his	1
own	1
First	1
seen:	1
Them	1
unexpected	1
joy	1
surprised,	1
When	1
the	1
great	1
ensign	1
of	1
Messiah	1
blazed	1
Aloft	1
by	1
Angels	1
borne,	1
his	1
sign	1
in	1
Heaven;	1
Under	1
whose	1
conduct	1
Michael	1
soon	1
reduced	1
His	1
army,	1
circumfused	1
on	1
either	1
wing,	1
Under	1
their	1
Head	1
imbodied	1
all	1
in	1
one.	1
Before	1
him	1
Power	1
Divine	1
his	1
way	1
prepared;	1
At	1
his	1
command	1
the	1
uprooted	1
hills	1
retired	1
Each	1
to	1
his	1
place;	1
they	1
heard	1
his	1
voice,	1
and	1
went	1
Obsequious;	1
Heaven	1
his	1
wonted	1
face	1
renewed,	1
And	1
with	1
fresh	1
flowerets	1
hill	1
and	1
valley	1
smiled.	1
This	1
saw	1
his	1
hapless	1
foes,	1
but	1
stood	1
obdured,	1
And	1
to	1
rebellious	1
fight	1
rallied	1
their	1
Powers,	1
Insensate,	1
hope	1
conceiving	1
from	1
despair.	1
In	1
heavenly	1
Spirits	1
could	1
such	1
perverseness	1
dwell?	1
But	1
to	1
convince	1
the	1
proud	1
what	1
signs	1
avail,	1
Or	1
wonders	1
move	1
the	1
obdurate	1
to	1
relent?	1
They,	1
hardened	1
more	1
by	1
what	1
might	1
most	1
reclaim,	1
Grieving	1
to	1
see	1
his	1
glory,	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
Took	1
envy;	1
and,	1
aspiring	1
to	1
his	1
highth,	1
Stood	1
re-embattled	1
fierce,	1
by	1
force	1
or	1
fraud	1
Weening	1
to	1
prosper,	1
and	1
at	1
length	1
prevail	1
Against	1
God	1
and	1
Messiah,	1
or	1
to	1
fall	1
In	1
universal	1
ruin	1
last;	1
and	1
now	1
To	1
final	1
battle	1
drew,	1
disdaining	1
flight,	1
Or	1
faint	1
retreat;	1
when	1
the	1
great	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
To	1
all	1
his	1
host	1
on	1
either	1
hand	1
thus	1
spake.	1
Stand	1
still	1
in	1
bright	1
array,	1
ye	1
Saints;	1
here	1
stand,	1
Ye	1
Angels	1
armed;	1
this	1
day	1
from	1
battle	1
rest:	1
Faithful	1
hath	1
been	1
your	1
warfare,	1
and	1
of	1
God	1
Accepted,	1
fearless	1
in	1
his	1
righteous	1
cause;	1
And	1
as	1
ye	1
have	1
received,	1
so	1
have	1
ye	1
done,	1
Invincibly:	1
But	1
of	1
this	1
cursed	1
crew	1
The	1
punishment	1
to	1
other	1
hand	1
belongs;	1
Vengeance	1
is	1
his,	1
or	1
whose	1
he	1
sole	1
appoints:	1
Number	1
to	1
this	1
day's	1
work	1
is	1
not	1
ordained,	1
Nor	1
multitude;	1
stand	1
only,	1
and	1
behold	1
God's	1
indignation	1
on	1
these	1
godless	1
poured	1
By	1
me;	1
not	1
you,	1
but	1
me,	1
they	1
have	1
despised,	1
Yet	1
envied;	1
against	1
me	1
is	1
all	1
their	1
rage,	1
Because	1
the	1
Father,	1
to	1
whom	1
in	1
Heaven	1
s'preme	1
Kingdom,	1
and	1
power,	1
and	1
glory	1
appertains,	1
Hath	1
honoured	1
me,	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
will.	1
Therefore	1
to	1
me	1
their	1
doom	1
he	1
hath	1
assigned;	1
That	1
they	1
may	1
have	1
their	1
wish,	1
to	1
try	1
with	1
me	1
In	1
battle	1
which	1
the	1
stronger	1
proves;	1
they	1
all,	1
Or	1
I	1
alone	1
against	1
them;	1
since	1
by	1
strength	1
They	1
measure	1
all,	1
of	1
other	1
excellence	1
Not	1
emulous,	1
nor	1
care	1
who	1
them	1
excels;	1
Nor	1
other	1
strife	1
with	1
them	1
do	1
I	1
vouchsafe.	1
So	1
spake	1
the	1
Son,	1
and	1
into	1
terrour	1
changed	1
His	1
countenance	1
too	1
severe	1
to	1
be	1
beheld,	1
And	1
full	1
of	1
wrath	1
bent	1
on	1
his	1
enemies.	1
At	1
once	1
the	1
Four	1
spread	1
out	1
their	1
starry	1
wings	1
With	1
dreadful	1
shade	1
contiguous,	1
and	1
the	1
orbs	1
Of	1
his	1
fierce	1
chariot	1
rolled,	1
as	1
with	1
the	1
sound	1
Of	1
torrent	1
floods,	1
or	1
of	1
a	1
numerous	1
host.	1
He	1
on	1
his	1
impious	1
foes	1
right	1
onward	1
drove,	1
Gloomy	1
as	1
night;	1
under	1
his	1
burning	1
wheels	1
The	1
stedfast	1
empyrean	1
shook	1
throughout,	1
All	1
but	1
the	1
throne	1
itself	1
of	1
God.	1
Full	1
soon	1
Among	1
them	1
he	1
arrived;	1
in	1
his	1
right	1
hand	1
Grasping	1
ten	1
thousand	1
thunders,	1
which	1
he	1
sent	1
Before	1
him,	1
such	1
as	1
in	1
their	1
souls	1
infixed	1
Plagues:	1
They,	1
astonished,	1
all	1
resistance	1
lost,	1
All	1
courage;	1
down	1
their	1
idle	1
weapons	1
dropt:	1
O'er	1
shields,	1
and	1
helms,	1
and	1
helmed	1
heads	1
he	1
rode	1
Of	1
Thrones	1
and	1
mighty	1
Seraphim	1
prostrate,	1
That	1
wished	1
the	1
mountains	1
now	1
might	1
be	1
again	1
Thrown	1
on	1
them,	1
as	1
a	1
shelter	1
from	1
his	1
ire.	1
Nor	1
less	1
on	1
either	1
side	1
tempestuous	1
fell	1
His	1
arrows,	1
from	1
the	1
fourfold-visaged	1
Four	1
Distinct	1
with	1
eyes,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
living	1
wheels	1
Distinct	1
alike	1
with	1
multitude	1
of	1
eyes;	1
One	1
Spirit	1
in	1
them	1
ruled;	1
and	1
every	1
eye	1
Glared	1
lightning,	1
and	1
shot	1
forth	1
pernicious	1
fire	1
Among	1
the	1
accursed,	1
that	1
withered	1
all	1
their	1
strength,	1
And	1
of	1
their	1
wonted	1
vigour	1
left	1
them	1
drained,	1
Exhausted,	1
spiritless,	1
afflicted,	1
fallen.	1
Yet	1
half	1
his	1
strength	1
he	1
put	1
not	1
forth,	1
but	1
checked	1
His	1
thunder	1
in	1
mid	1
volley;	1
for	1
he	1
meant	1
Not	1
to	1
destroy,	1
but	1
root	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
Heaven:	1
The	1
overthrown	1
he	1
raised,	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
herd	1
Of	1
goats	1
or	1
timorous	1
flock	1
together	1
thronged	1
Drove	1
them	1
before	1
him	1
thunder-struck,	1
pursued	1
With	1
terrours,	1
and	1
with	1
furies,	1
to	1
the	1
bounds	1
And	1
crystal	1
wall	1
of	1
Heaven;	1
which,	1
opening	1
wide,	1
Rolled	1
inward,	1
and	1
a	1
spacious	1
gap	1
disclosed	1
Into	1
the	1
wasteful	1
deep:	1
The	1
monstrous	1
sight	1
Struck	1
them	1
with	1
horrour	1
backward,	1
but	1
far	1
worse	1
Urged	1
them	1
behind:	1
Headlong	1
themselves	1
they	1
threw	1
Down	1
from	1
the	1
verge	1
of	1
Heaven;	1
eternal	1
wrath	1
Burnt	1
after	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
bottomless	1
pit.	1
Hell	1
heard	1
the	1
unsufferable	1
noise,	1
Hell	1
saw	1
Heaven	1
ruining	1
from	1
Heaven,	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
fled	1
Affrighted;	1
but	1
strict	1
Fate	1
had	1
cast	1
too	1
deep	1
Her	1
dark	1
foundations,	1
and	1
too	1
fast	1
had	1
bound.	1
Nine	1
days	1
they	1
fell:	1
Confounded	1
Chaos	1
roared,	1
And	1
felt	1
tenfold	1
confusion	1
in	1
their	1
fall	1
Through	1
his	1
wild	1
anarchy,	1
so	1
huge	1
a	1
rout	1
Incumbered	1
him	1
with	1
ruin:	1
Hell	1
at	1
last	1
Yawning	1
received	1
them	1
whole,	1
and	1
on	1
them	1
closed;	1
Hell,	1
their	1
fit	1
habitation,	1
fraught	1
with	1
fire	1
Unquenchable,	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
woe	1
and	1
pain.	1
Disburdened	1
Heaven	1
rejoiced,	1
and	1
soon	1
repaired	1
Her	1
mural	1
breach,	1
returning	1
whence	1
it	1
rolled.	1
Sole	1
victor,	1
from	1
the	1
expulsion	1
of	1
his	1
foes,	1
Messiah	1
his	1
triumphal	1
chariot	1
turned:	1
To	1
meet	1
him	1
all	1
his	1
Saints,	1
who	1
silent	1
stood	1
Eye-witnesses	1
of	1
his	1
almighty	1
acts,	1
With	1
jubilee	1
advanced;	1
and,	1
as	1
they	1
went,	1
Shaded	1
with	1
branching	1
palm,	1
each	1
Order	1
bright,	1
Sung	1
triumph,	1
and	1
him	1
sung	1
victorious	1
King,	1
Son,	1
Heir,	1
and	1
Lord,	1
to	1
him	1
dominion	1
given,	1
Worthiest	1
to	1
reign:	1
He,	1
celebrated,	1
rode	1
Triumphant	1
through	1
mid	1
Heaven,	1
into	1
the	1
courts	1
And	1
temple	1
of	1
his	1
Mighty	1
Father	1
throned	1
On	1
high;	1
who	1
into	1
glory	1
him	1
received,	1
Where	1
now	1
he	1
sits	1
at	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
bliss.	1
Thus,	1
measuring	1
things	1
in	1
Heaven	1
by	1
things	1
on	1
Earth,	1
At	1
thy	1
request,	1
and	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
beware	1
By	1
what	1
is	1
past,	1
to	1
thee	1
I	1
have	1
revealed	1
What	1
might	1
have	1
else	1
to	1
human	1
race	1
been	1
hid;	1
The	1
discord	1
which	1
befel,	1
and	1
war	1
in	1
Heaven	1
Among	1
the	1
angelick	1
Powers,	1
and	1
the	1
deep	1
fall	1
Of	1
those	1
too	1
high	1
aspiring,	1
who	1
rebelled	1
With	1
Satan;	1
he	1
who	1
envies	1
now	1
thy	1
state,	1
Who	1
now	1
is	1
plotting	1
how	1
he	1
may	1
seduce	1
Thee	1
also	1
from	1
obedience,	1
that,	1
with	1
him	1
Bereaved	1
of	1
happiness,	1
thou	1
mayest	1
partake	1
His	1
punishment,	1
eternal	1
misery;	1
Which	1
would	1
be	1
all	1
his	1
solace	1
and	1
revenge,	1
As	1
a	1
despite	1
done	1
against	1
the	1
Most	1
High,	1
Thee	1
once	1
to	1
gain	1
companion	1
of	1
his	1
woe.	1
But	1
listen	1
not	1
to	1
his	1
temptations,	1
warn	1
Thy	1
weaker;	1
let	1
it	1
profit	1
thee	1
to	1
have	1
heard,	1
By	1
terrible	1
example,	1
the	1
reward	1
Of	1
disobedience;	1
firm	1
they	1
might	1
have	1
stood,	1
Yet	1
fell;	1
remember,	1
and	1
fear	1
to	1
transgress.	1
Book	1
VII	1
Descend	1
from	1
Heaven,	1
Urania,	1
by	1
that	1
name	1
If	1
rightly	1
thou	1
art	1
called,	1
whose	1
voice	1
divine	1
Following,	1
above	1
the	1
Olympian	1
hill	1
I	1
soar,	1
Above	1
the	1
flight	1
of	1
Pegasean	1
wing!	1
The	1
meaning,	1
not	1
the	1
name,	1
I	1
call:	1
for	1
thou	1
Nor	1
of	1
the	1
Muses	1
nine,	1
nor	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
Of	1
old	1
Olympus	1
dwellest;	1
but,	1
heavenly-born,	1
Before	1
the	1
hills	1
appeared,	1
or	1
fountain	1
flowed,	1
Thou	1
with	1
eternal	1
Wisdom	1
didst	1
converse,	1
Wisdom	1
thy	1
sister,	1
and	1
with	1
her	1
didst	1
play	1
In	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
Almighty	1
Father,	1
pleased	1
With	1
thy	1
celestial	1
song.	1
Up	1
led	1
by	1
thee	1
Into	1
the	1
Heaven	1
of	1
Heavens	1
I	1
have	1
presumed,	1
An	1
earthly	1
guest,	1
and	1
drawn	1
empyreal	1
air,	1
Thy	1
tempering:	1
with	1
like	1
safety	1
guided	1
down	1
Return	1
me	1
to	1
my	1
native	1
element:	1
Lest	1
from	1
this	1
flying	1
steed	1
unreined,	1
(as	1
once	1
Bellerophon,	1
though	1
from	1
a	1
lower	1
clime,)	1
Dismounted,	1
on	1
the	1
Aleian	1
field	1
I	1
fall,	1
Erroneous	1
there	1
to	1
wander,	1
and	1
forlorn.	1
Half	1
yet	1
remains	1
unsung,	1
but	1
narrower	1
bound	1
Within	1
the	1
visible	1
diurnal	1
sphere;	1
Standing	1
on	1
earth,	1
not	1
rapt	1
above	1
the	1
pole,	1
More	1
safe	1
I	1
sing	1
with	1
mortal	1
voice,	1
unchanged	1
To	1
hoarse	1
or	1
mute,	1
though	1
fallen	1
on	1
evil	1
days,	1
On	1
evil	1
days	1
though	1
fallen,	1
and	1
evil	1
tongues;	1
In	1
darkness,	1
and	1
with	1
dangers	1
compassed	1
round,	1
And	1
solitude;	1
yet	1
not	1
alone,	1
while	1
thou	1
Visitest	1
my	1
slumbers	1
nightly,	1
or	1
when	1
morn	1
Purples	1
the	1
east:	1
still	1
govern	1
thou	1
my	1
song,	1
Urania,	1
and	1
fit	1
audience	1
find,	1
though	1
few.	1
But	1
drive	1
far	1
off	1
the	1
barbarous	1
dissonance	1
Of	1
Bacchus	1
and	1
his	1
revellers,	1
the	1
race	1
Of	1
that	1
wild	1
rout	1
that	1
tore	1
the	1
Thracian	1
bard	1
In	1
Rhodope,	1
where	1
woods	1
and	1
rocks	1
had	1
ears	1
To	1
rapture,	1
till	1
the	1
savage	1
clamour	1
drowned	1
Both	1
harp	1
and	1
voice;	1
nor	1
could	1
the	1
Muse	1
defend	1
Her	1
son.	1
So	1
fail	1
not	1
thou,	1
who	1
thee	1
implores:	1
For	1
thou	1
art	1
heavenly,	1
she	1
an	1
empty	1
dream.	1
Say,	1
Goddess,	1
what	1
ensued	1
when	1
Raphael,	1
The	1
affable	1
Arch-Angel,	1
had	1
forewarned	1
Adam,	1
by	1
dire	1
example,	1
to	1
beware	1
Apostasy,	1
by	1
what	1
befel	1
in	1
Heaven	1
To	1
those	1
apostates;	1
lest	1
the	1
like	1
befall	1
In	1
Paradise	1
to	1
Adam	1
or	1
his	1
race,	1
Charged	1
not	1
to	1
touch	1
the	1
interdicted	1
tree,	1
If	1
they	1
transgress,	1
and	1
slight	1
that	1
sole	1
command,	1
So	1
easily	1
obeyed	1
amid	1
the	1
choice	1
Of	1
all	1
tastes	1
else	1
to	1
please	1
their	1
appetite,	1
Though	1
wandering.	1
He,	1
with	1
his	1
consorted	1
Eve,	1
The	1
story	1
heard	1
attentive,	1
and	1
was	1
filled	1
With	1
admiration	1
and	1
deep	1
muse,	1
to	1
hear	1
Of	1
things	1
so	1
high	1
and	1
strange;	1
things,	1
to	1
their	1
thought	1
So	1
unimaginable,	1
as	1
hate	1
in	1
Heaven,	1
And	1
war	1
so	1
near	1
the	1
peace	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
bliss,	1
With	1
such	1
confusion:	1
but	1
the	1
evil,	1
soon	1
Driven	1
back,	1
redounded	1
as	1
a	1
flood	1
on	1
those	1
From	1
whom	1
it	1
sprung;	1
impossible	1
to	1
mix	1
With	1
blessedness.	1
Whence	1
Adam	1
soon	1
repealed	1
The	1
doubts	1
that	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
arose:	1
and	1
now	1
Led	1
on,	1
yet	1
sinless,	1
with	1
desire	1
to	1
know	1
What	1
nearer	1
might	1
concern	1
him,	1
how	1
this	1
world	1
Of	1
Heaven	1
and	1
Earth	1
conspicuous	1
first	1
began;	1
When,	1
and	1
whereof	1
created;	1
for	1
what	1
cause;	1
What	1
within	1
Eden,	1
or	1
without,	1
was	1
done	1
Before	1
his	1
memory;	1
as	1
one	1
whose	1
drouth	1
Yet	1
scarce	1
allayed	1
still	1
eyes	1
the	1
current	1
stream,	1
Whose	1
liquid	1
murmur	1
heard	1
new	1
thirst	1
excites,	1
Proceeded	1
thus	1
to	1
ask	1
his	1
heavenly	1
guest.	1
Great	1
things,	1
and	1
full	1
of	1
wonder	1
in	1
our	1
ears,	1
Far	1
differing	1
from	1
this	1
world,	1
thou	1
hast	1
revealed,	1
Divine	1
interpreter!	1
by	1
favour	1
sent	1
Down	1
from	1
the	1
empyrean,	1
to	1
forewarn	1
Us	1
timely	1
of	1
what	1
might	1
else	1
have	1
been	1
our	1
loss,	1
Unknown,	1
which	1
human	1
knowledge	1
could	1
not	1
reach;	1
For	1
which	1
to	1
the	1
infinitely	1
Good	1
we	1
owe	1
Immortal	1
thanks,	1
and	1
his	1
admonishment	1
Receive,	1
with	1
solemn	1
purpose	1
to	1
observe	1
Immutably	1
his	1
sovran	1
will,	1
the	1
end	1
Of	1
what	1
we	1
are.	1
But	1
since	1
thou	1
hast	1
vouchsafed	1
Gently,	1
for	1
our	1
instruction,	1
to	1
impart	1
Things	1
above	1
earthly	1
thought,	1
which	1
yet	1
concerned	1
Our	1
knowing,	1
as	1
to	1
highest	1
wisdom	1
seemed,	1
Deign	1
to	1
descend	1
now	1
lower,	1
and	1
relate	1
What	1
may	1
no	1
less	1
perhaps	1
avail	1
us	1
known,	1
How	1
first	1
began	1
this	1
Heaven	1
which	1
we	1
behold	1
Distant	1
so	1
high,	1
with	1
moving	1
fires	1
adorned	1
Innumerable;	1
and	1
this	1
which	1
yields	1
or	1
fills	1
All	1
space,	1
the	1
ambient	1
air	1
wide	1
interfused	1
Embracing	1
round	1
this	1
floried	1
Earth;	1
what	1
cause	1
Moved	1
the	1
Creator,	1
in	1
his	1
holy	1
rest	1
Through	1
all	1
eternity,	1
so	1
late	1
to	1
build	1
In	1
Chaos;	1
and	1
the	1
work	1
begun,	1
how	1
soon	1
Absolved;	1
if	1
unforbid	1
thou	1
mayest	1
unfold	1
What	1
we,	1
not	1
to	1
explore	1
the	1
secrets	1
ask	1
Of	1
his	1
eternal	1
empire,	1
but	1
the	1
more	1
To	1
magnify	1
his	1
works,	1
the	1
more	1
we	1
know.	1
And	1
the	1
great	1
light	1
of	1
day	1
yet	1
wants	1
to	1
run	1
Much	1
of	1
his	1
race	1
though	1
steep;	1
suspense	1
in	1
Heaven,	1
Held	1
by	1
thy	1
voice,	1
thy	1
potent	1
voice,	1
he	1
hears,	1
And	1
longer	1
will	1
delay	1
to	1
hear	1
thee	1
tell	1
His	1
generation,	1
and	1
the	1
rising	1
birth	1
Of	1
Nature	1
from	1
the	1
unapparent	1
Deep:	1
Or	1
if	1
the	1
star	1
of	1
evening	1
and	1
the	1
moon	1
Haste	1
to	1
thy	1
audience,	1
Night	1
with	1
her	1
will	1
bring,	1
Silence;	1
and	1
Sleep,	1
listening	1
to	1
thee,	1
will	1
watch;	1
Or	1
we	1
can	1
bid	1
his	1
absence,	1
till	1
thy	1
song	1
End,	1
and	1
dismiss	1
thee	1
ere	1
the	1
morning	1
shine.	1
Thus	1
Adam	1
his	1
illustrious	1
guest	1
besought:	1
And	1
thus	1
the	1
Godlike	1
Angel	1
answered	1
mild.	1
This	1
also	1
thy	1
request,	1
with	1
caution	1
asked,	1
Obtain;	1
though	1
to	1
recount	1
almighty	1
works	1
What	1
words	1
or	1
tongue	1
of	1
Seraph	1
can	1
suffice,	1
Or	1
heart	1
of	1
man	1
suffice	1
to	1
comprehend?	1
Yet	1
what	1
thou	1
canst	1
attain,	1
which	1
best	1
may	1
serve	1
To	1
glorify	1
the	1
Maker,	1
and	1
infer	1
Thee	1
also	1
happier,	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
withheld	1
Thy	1
hearing;	1
such	1
commission	1
from	1
above	1
I	1
have	1
received,	1
to	1
answer	1
thy	1
desire	1
Of	1
knowledge	1
within	1
bounds;	1
beyond,	1
abstain	1
To	1
ask;	1
nor	1
let	1
thine	1
own	1
inventions	1
hope	1
Things	1
not	1
revealed,	1
which	1
the	1
invisible	1
King,	1
Only	1
Omniscient,	1
hath	1
suppressed	1
in	1
night;	1
To	1
none	1
communicable	1
in	1
Earth	1
or	1
Heaven:	1
Enough	1
is	1
left	1
besides	1
to	1
search	1
and	1
know.	1
But	1
knowledge	1
is	1
as	1
food,	1
and	1
needs	1
no	1
less	1
Her	1
temperance	1
over	1
appetite,	1
to	1
know	1
In	1
measure	1
what	1
the	1
mind	1
may	1
well	1
contain;	1
Oppresses	1
else	1
with	1
surfeit,	1
and	1
soon	1
turns	1
Wisdom	1
to	1
folly,	1
as	1
nourishment	1
to	1
wind.	1
Know	1
then,	1
that,	1
after	1
Lucifer	1
from	1
Heaven	1
(So	1
call	1
him,	1
brighter	1
once	1
amidst	1
the	1
host	1
Of	1
Angels,	1
than	1
that	1
star	1
the	1
stars	1
among,)	1
Fell	1
with	1
his	1
flaming	1
legions	1
through	1
the	1
deep	1
Into	1
his	1
place,	1
and	1
the	1
great	1
Son	1
returned	1
Victorious	1
with	1
his	1
Saints,	1
the	1
Omnipotent	1
Eternal	1
Father	1
from	1
his	1
throne	1
beheld	1
Their	1
multitude,	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
Son	1
thus	1
spake.	1
At	1
least	1
our	1
envious	1
Foe	1
hath	1
failed,	1
who	1
thought	1
All	1
like	1
himself	1
rebellious,	1
by	1
whose	1
aid	1
This	1
inaccessible	1
high	1
strength,	1
the	1
seat	1
Of	1
Deity	1
supreme,	1
us	1
dispossessed,	1
He	1
trusted	1
to	1
have	1
seised,	1
and	1
into	1
fraud	1
Drew	1
many,	1
whom	1
their	1
place	1
knows	1
here	1
no	1
more:	1
Yet	1
far	1
the	1
greater	1
part	1
have	1
kept,	1
I	1
see,	1
Their	1
station;	1
Heaven,	1
yet	1
populous,	1
retains	1
Number	1
sufficient	1
to	1
possess	1
her	1
realms	1
Though	1
wide,	1
and	1
this	1
high	1
temple	1
to	1
frequent	1
With	1
ministeries	1
due,	1
and	1
solemn	1
rites:	1
But,	1
lest	1
his	1
heart	1
exalt	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
harm	1
Already	1
done,	1
to	1
have	1
dispeopled	1
Heaven,	1
My	1
damage	1
fondly	1
deemed,	1
I	1
can	1
repair	1
That	1
detriment,	1
if	1
such	1
it	1
be	1
to	1
lose	1
Self-lost;	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
moment	1
will	1
create	1
Another	1
world,	1
out	1
of	1
one	1
man	1
a	1
race	1
Of	1
men	1
innumerable,	1
there	1
to	1
dwell,	1
Not	1
here;	1
till,	1
by	1
degrees	1
of	1
merit	1
raised,	1
They	1
open	1
to	1
themselves	1
at	1
length	1
the	1
way	1
Up	1
hither,	1
under	1
long	1
obedience	1
tried;	1
And	1
Earth	1
be	1
changed	1
to	1
Heaven,	1
and	1
Heaven	1
to	1
Earth,	1
One	1
kingdom,	1
joy	1
and	1
union	1
without	1
end.	1
Mean	1
while	1
inhabit	1
lax,	1
ye	1
Powers	1
of	1
Heaven;	1
And	1
thou	1
my	1
Word,	1
begotten	1
Son,	1
by	1
thee	1
This	1
I	1
perform;	1
speak	1
thou,	1
and	1
be	1
it	1
done!	1
My	1
overshadowing	1
Spirit	1
and	1
Might	1
with	1
thee	1
I	1
send	1
along;	1
ride	1
forth,	1
and	1
bid	1
the	1
Deep	1
Within	1
appointed	1
bounds	1
be	1
Heaven	1
and	1
Earth;	1
Boundless	1
the	1
Deep,	1
because	1
I	1
Am	1
who	1
fill	1
Infinitude,	1
nor	1
vacuous	1
the	1
space.	1
Though	1
I,	1
uncircumscribed	1
myself,	1
retire,	1
And	1
put	1
not	1
forth	1
my	1
goodness,	1
which	1
is	1
free	1
To	1
act	1
or	1
not,	1
Necessity	1
and	1
Chance	1
Approach	1
not	1
me,	1
and	1
what	1
I	1
will	1
is	1
Fate.	1
So	1
spake	1
the	1
Almighty,	1
and	1
to	1
what	1
he	1
spake	1
His	1
Word,	1
the	1
Filial	1
Godhead,	1
gave	1
effect.	1
Immediate	1
are	1
the	1
acts	1
of	1
God,	1
more	1
swift	1
Than	1
time	1
or	1
motion,	1
but	1
to	1
human	1
ears	1
Cannot	1
without	1
process	1
of	1
speech	1
be	1
told,	1
So	1
told	1
as	1
earthly	1
notion	1
can	1
receive.	1
Great	1
triumph	1
and	1
rejoicing	1
was	1
in	1
Heaven,	1
When	1
such	1
was	1
heard	1
declared	1
the	1
Almighty's	1
will;	1
Glory	1
they	1
sung	1
to	1
the	1
Most	1
High,	1
good	1
will	1
To	1
future	1
men,	1
and	1
in	1
their	1
dwellings	1
peace;	1
Glory	1
to	1
Him,	1
whose	1
just	1
avenging	1
ire	1
Had	1
driven	1
out	1
the	1
ungodly	1
from	1
his	1
sight	1
And	1
the	1
habitations	1
of	1
the	1
just;	1
to	1
Him	1
Glory	1
and	1
praise,	1
whose	1
wisdom	1
had	1
ordained	1
Good	1
out	1
of	1
evil	1
to	1
create;	1
instead	1
Of	1
Spirits	1
malign,	1
a	1
better	1
race	1
to	1
bring	1
Into	1
their	1
vacant	1
room,	1
and	1
thence	1
diffuse	1
His	1
good	1
to	1
worlds	1
and	1
ages	1
infinite.	1
So	1
sang	1
the	1
Hierarchies:	1
Mean	1
while	1
the	1
Son	1
On	1
his	1
great	1
expedition	1
now	1
appeared,	1
Girt	1
with	1
Omnipotence,	1
with	1
radiance	1
crowned	1
Of	1
Majesty	1
Divine;	1
sapience	1
and	1
love	1
Immense,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
Father	1
in	1
him	1
shone.	1
About	1
his	1
chariot	1
numberless	1
were	1
poured	1
Cherub,	1
and	1
Seraph,	1
Potentates,	1
and	1
Thrones,	1
And	1
Virtues,	1
winged	1
Spirits,	1
and	1
chariots	1
winged	1
From	1
the	1
armoury	1
of	1
God;	1
where	1
stand	1
of	1
old	1
Myriads,	1
between	1
two	1
brazen	1
mountains	1
lodged	1
Against	1
a	1
solemn	1
day,	1
harnessed	1
at	1
hand,	1
Celestial	1
equipage;	1
and	1
now	1
came	1
forth	1
Spontaneous,	1
for	1
within	1
them	1
Spirit	1
lived,	1
Attendant	1
on	1
their	1
Lord:	1
Heaven	1
opened	1
wide	1
Her	1
ever-during	1
gates,	1
harmonious	1
sound	1
On	1
golden	1
hinges	1
moving,	1
to	1
let	1
forth	1
The	1
King	1
of	1
Glory,	1
in	1
his	1
powerful	1
Word	1
And	1
Spirit,	1
coming	1
to	1
create	1
new	1
worlds.	1
On	1
heavenly	1
ground	1
they	1
stood;	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
shore	1
They	1
viewed	1
the	1
vast	1
immeasurable	1
abyss	1
Outrageous	1
as	1
a	1
sea,	1
dark,	1
wasteful,	1
wild,	1
Up	1
from	1
the	1
bottom	1
turned	1
by	1
furious	1
winds	1
And	1
surging	1
waves,	1
as	1
mountains,	1
to	1
assault	1
Heaven's	1
highth,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
center	1
mix	1
the	1
pole.	1
Silence,	1
ye	1
troubled	1
Waves,	1
and	1
thou	1
Deep,	1
peace,	1
Said	1
then	1
the	1
Omnifick	1
Word;	1
your	1
discord	1
end!	1
Nor	1
staid;	1
but,	1
on	1
the	1
wings	1
of	1
Cherubim	1
Uplifted,	1
in	1
paternal	1
glory	1
rode	1
Far	1
into	1
Chaos,	1
and	1
the	1
world	1
unborn;	1
For	1
Chaos	1
heard	1
his	1
voice:	1
Him	1
all	1
his	1
train	1
Followed	1
in	1
bright	1
procession,	1
to	1
behold	1
Creation,	1
and	1
the	1
wonders	1
of	1
his	1
might.	1
Then	1
staid	1
the	1
fervid	1
wheels,	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
He	1
took	1
the	1
golden	1
compasses,	1
prepared	1
In	1
God's	1
eternal	1
store,	1
to	1
circumscribe	1
This	1
universe,	1
and	1
all	1
created	1
things:	1
One	1
foot	1
he	1
centered,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
turned	1
Round	1
through	1
the	1
vast	1
profundity	1
obscure;	1
And	1
said,	1
Thus	1
far	1
extend,	1
thus	1
far	1
thy	1
bounds,	1
This	1
be	1
thy	1
just	1
circumference,	1
O	1
World!	1
Thus	1
God	1
the	1
Heaven	1
created,	1
thus	1
the	1
Earth,	1
Matter	1
unformed	1
and	1
void:	1
Darkness	1
profound	1
Covered	1
the	1
abyss:	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
watery	1
calm	1
His	1
brooding	1
wings	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God	1
outspread,	1
And	1
vital	1
virtue	1
infused,	1
and	1
vital	1
warmth	1
Throughout	1
the	1
fluid	1
mass;	1
but	1
downward	1
purged	1
The	1
black	1
tartareous	1
cold	1
infernal	1
dregs,	1
Adverse	1
to	1
life:	1
then	1
founded,	1
then	1
conglobed	1
Like	1
things	1
to	1
like;	1
the	1
rest	1
to	1
several	1
place	1
Disparted,	1
and	1
between	1
spun	1
out	1
the	1
air;	1
And	1
Earth	1
self-balanced	1
on	1
her	1
center	1
hung.	1
Let	1
there	1
be	1
light,	1
said	1
God;	1
and	1
forthwith	1
Light	1
Ethereal,	1
first	1
of	1
things,	1
quintessence	1
pure,	1
Sprung	1
from	1
the	1
deep;	1
and	1
from	1
her	1
native	1
east	1
To	1
journey	1
through	1
the	1
aery	1
gloom	1
began,	1
Sphered	1
in	1
a	1
radiant	1
cloud,	1
for	1
yet	1
the	1
sun	1
Was	1
not;	1
she	1
in	1
a	1
cloudy	1
tabernacle	1
Sojourned	1
the	1
while.	1
God	1
saw	1
the	1
light	1
was	1
good;	1
And	1
light	1
from	1
darkness	1
by	1
the	1
hemisphere	1
Divided:	1
light	1
the	1
Day,	1
and	1
darkness	1
Night,	1
He	1
named.	1
Thus	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
even	1
and	1
morn:	1
Nor	1
past	1
uncelebrated,	1
nor	1
unsung	1
By	1
the	1
celestial	1
quires,	1
when	1
orient	1
light	1
Exhaling	1
first	1
from	1
darkness	1
they	1
beheld;	1
Birth-day	1
of	1
Heaven	1
and	1
Earth;	1
with	1
joy	1
and	1
shout	1
The	1
hollow	1
universal	1
orb	1
they	1
filled,	1
And	1
touched	1
their	1
golden	1
harps,	1
and	1
hymning	1
praised	1
God	1
and	1
his	1
works;	1
Creator	1
him	1
they	1
sung,	1
Both	1
when	1
first	1
evening	1
was,	1
and	1
when	1
first	1
morn.	1
Again,	1
God	1
said,	1
Let	1
there	1
be	1
firmament	1
Amid	1
the	1
waters,	1
and	1
let	1
it	1
divide	1
The	1
waters	1
from	1
the	1
waters;	1
and	1
God	1
made	1
The	1
firmament,	1
expanse	1
of	1
liquid,	1
pure,	1
Transparent,	1
elemental	1
air,	1
diffused	1
In	1
circuit	1
to	1
the	1
uttermost	1
convex	1
Of	1
this	1
great	1
round;	1
partition	1
firm	1
and	1
sure,	1
The	1
waters	1
underneath	1
from	1
those	1
above	1
Dividing:	1
for	1
as	1
earth,	1
so	1
he	1
the	1
world	1
Built	1
on	1
circumfluous	1
waters	1
calm,	1
in	1
wide	1
Crystalline	1
ocean,	1
and	1
the	1
loud	1
misrule	1
Of	1
Chaos	1
far	1
removed;	1
lest	1
fierce	1
extremes	1
Contiguous	1
might	1
distemper	1
the	1
whole	1
frame:	1
And	1
Heaven	1
he	1
named	1
the	1
Firmament:	1
So	1
even	1
And	1
morning	1
chorus	1
sung	1
the	1
second	1
day.	1
The	1
Earth	1
was	1
formed,	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
womb	1
as	1
yet	1
Of	1
waters,	1
embryon	1
immature	1
involved,	1
Appeared	1
not:	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
Earth	1
Main	1
ocean	1
flowed,	1
not	1
idle;	1
but,	1
with	1
warm	1
Prolifick	1
humour	1
softening	1
all	1
her	1
globe,	1
Fermented	1
the	1
great	1
mother	1
to	1
conceive,	1
Satiate	1
with	1
genial	1
moisture;	1
when	1
God	1
said,	1
Be	1
gathered	1
now	1
ye	1
waters	1
under	1
Heaven	1
Into	1
one	1
place,	1
and	1
let	1
dry	1
land	1
appear.	1
Immediately	1
the	1
mountains	1
huge	1
appear	1
Emergent,	1
and	1
their	1
broad	1
bare	1
backs	1
upheave	1
Into	1
the	1
clouds;	1
their	1
tops	1
ascend	1
the	1
sky:	1
So	1
high	1
as	1
heaved	1
the	1
tumid	1
hills,	1
so	1
low	1
Down	1
sunk	1
a	1
hollow	1
bottom	1
broad	1
and	1
deep,	1
Capacious	1
bed	1
of	1
waters:	1
Thither	1
they	1
Hasted	1
with	1
glad	1
precipitance,	1
uprolled,	1
As	1
drops	1
on	1
dust	1
conglobing	1
from	1
the	1
dry:	1
Part	1
rise	1
in	1
crystal	1
wall,	1
or	1
ridge	1
direct,	1
For	1
haste;	1
such	1
flight	1
the	1
great	1
command	1
impressed	1
On	1
the	1
swift	1
floods:	1
As	1
armies	1
at	1
the	1
call	1
Of	1
trumpet	1
(for	1
of	1
armies	1
thou	1
hast	1
heard)	1
Troop	1
to	1
their	1
standard;	1
so	1
the	1
watery	1
throng,	1
Wave	1
rolling	1
after	1
wave,	1
where	1
way	1
they	1
found,	1
If	1
steep,	1
with	1
torrent	1
rapture,	1
if	1
through	1
plain,	1
Soft-ebbing;	1
nor	1
withstood	1
them	1
rock	1
or	1
hill;	1
But	1
they,	1
or	1
under	1
ground,	1
or	1
circuit	1
wide	1
With	1
serpent	1
errour	1
wandering,	1
found	1
their	1
way,	1
And	1
on	1
the	1
washy	1
oose	1
deep	1
channels	1
wore;	1
Easy,	1
ere	1
God	1
had	1
bid	1
the	1
ground	1
be	1
dry,	1
All	1
but	1
within	1
those	1
banks,	1
where	1
rivers	1
now	1
Stream,	1
and	1
perpetual	1
draw	1
their	1
humid	1
train.	1
The	1
dry	1
land,	1
Earth;	1
and	1
the	1
great	1
receptacle	1
Of	1
congregated	1
waters,	1
he	1
called	1
Seas:	1
And	1
saw	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
good;	1
and	1
said,	1
Let	1
the	1
Earth	1
Put	1
forth	1
the	1
verdant	1
grass,	1
herb	1
yielding	1
seed,	1
And	1
fruit-tree	1
yielding	1
fruit	1
after	1
her	1
kind,	1
Whose	1
seed	1
is	1
in	1
herself	1
upon	1
the	1
Earth.	1
He	1
scarce	1
had	1
said,	1
when	1
the	1
bare	1
Earth,	1
till	1
then	1
Desart	1
and	1
bare,	1
unsightly,	1
unadorned,	1
Brought	1
forth	1
the	1
tender	1
grass,	1
whose	1
verdure	1
clad	1
Her	1
universal	1
face	1
with	1
pleasant	1
green;	1
Then	1
herbs	1
of	1
every	1
leaf,	1
that	1
sudden	1
flowered	1
Opening	1
their	1
various	1
colours,	1
and	1
made	1
gay	1
Her	1
bosom,	1
smelling	1
sweet:	1
and,	1
these	1
scarce	1
blown,	1
Forth	1
flourished	1
thick	1
the	1
clustering	1
vine,	1
forth	1
crept	1
The	1
swelling	1
gourd,	1
up	1
stood	1
the	1
corny	1
reed	1
Embattled	1
in	1
her	1
field,	1
and	1
the	1
humble	1
shrub,	1
And	1
bush	1
with	1
frizzled	1
hair	1
implicit:	1
Last	1
Rose,	1
as	1
in	1
dance,	1
the	1
stately	1
trees,	1
and	1
spread	1
Their	1
branches	1
hung	1
with	1
copious	1
fruit,	1
or	1
gemmed	1
Their	1
blossoms:	1
With	1
high	1
woods	1
the	1
hills	1
were	1
crowned;	1
With	1
tufts	1
the	1
valleys,	1
and	1
each	1
fountain	1
side;	1
With	1
borders	1
long	1
the	1
rivers:	1
that	1
Earth	1
now	1
Seemed	1
like	1
to	1
Heaven,	1
a	1
seat	1
where	1
Gods	1
might	1
dwell,	1
Or	1
wander	1
with	1
delight,	1
and	1
love	1
to	1
haunt	1
Her	1
sacred	1
shades:	1
though	1
God	1
had	1
yet	1
not	1
rained	1
Upon	1
the	1
Earth,	1
and	1
man	1
to	1
till	1
the	1
ground	1
None	1
was;	1
but	1
from	1
the	1
Earth	1
a	1
dewy	1
mist	1
Went	1
up,	1
and	1
watered	1
all	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
each	1
Plant	1
of	1
the	1
field;	1
which,	1
ere	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
Earth,	1
God	1
made,	1
and	1
every	1
herb,	1
before	1
it	1
grew	1
On	1
the	1
green	1
stem:	1
God	1
saw	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
good:	1
So	1
even	1
and	1
morn	1
recorded	1
the	1
third	1
day.	1
Again	1
the	1
Almighty	1
spake,	1
Let	1
there	1
be	1
lights	1
High	1
in	1
the	1
expanse	1
of	1
Heaven,	1
to	1
divide	1
The	1
day	1
from	1
night;	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
be	1
for	1
signs,	1
For	1
seasons,	1
and	1
for	1
days,	1
and	1
circling	1
years;	1
And	1
let	1
them	1
be	1
for	1
lights,	1
as	1
I	1
ordain	1
Their	1
office	1
in	1
the	1
firmament	1
of	1
Heaven,	1
To	1
give	1
light	1
on	1
the	1
Earth;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
so.	1
And	1
God	1
made	1
two	1
great	1
lights,	1
great	1
for	1
their	1
use	1
To	1
Man,	1
the	1
greater	1
to	1
have	1
rule	1
by	1
day,	1
The	1
less	1
by	1
night,	1
altern;	1
and	1
made	1
the	1
stars,	1
And	1
set	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
firmament	1
of	1
Heaven	1
To	1
illuminate	1
the	1
Earth,	1
and	1
rule	1
the	1
day	1
In	1
their	1
vicissitude,	1
and	1
rule	1
the	1
night,	1
And	1
light	1
from	1
darkness	1
to	1
divide.	1
God	1
saw,	1
Surveying	1
his	1
great	1
work,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
good:	1
For	1
of	1
celestial	1
bodies	1
first	1
the	1
sun	1
A	1
mighty	1
sphere	1
he	1
framed,	1
unlightsome	1
first,	1
Though	1
of	1
ethereal	1
mould:	1
then	1
formed	1
the	1
moon	1
Globose,	1
and	1
every	1
magnitude	1
of	1
stars,	1
And	1
sowed	1
with	1
stars	1
the	1
Heaven,	1
thick	1
as	1
a	1
field:	1
Of	1
light	1
by	1
far	1
the	1
greater	1
part	1
he	1
took,	1
Transplanted	1
from	1
her	1
cloudy	1
shrine,	1
and	1
placed	1
In	1
the	1
sun's	1
orb,	1
made	1
porous	1
to	1
receive	1
And	1
drink	1
the	1
liquid	1
light;	1
firm	1
to	1
retain	1
Her	1
gathered	1
beams,	1
great	1
palace	1
now	1
of	1
light.	1
Hither,	1
as	1
to	1
their	1
fountain,	1
other	1
stars	1
Repairing,	1
in	1
their	1
golden	1
urns	1
draw	1
light,	1
And	1
hence	1
the	1
morning-planet	1
gilds	1
her	1
horns;	1
By	1
tincture	1
or	1
reflection	1
they	1
augment	1
Their	1
small	1
peculiar,	1
though	1
from	1
human	1
sight	1
So	1
far	1
remote,	1
with	1
diminution	1
seen,	1
First	1
in	1
his	1
east	1
the	1
glorious	1
lamp	1
was	1
seen,	1
Regent	1
of	1
day,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
horizon	1
round	1
Invested	1
with	1
bright	1
rays,	1
jocund	1
to	1
run	1
His	1
longitude	1
through	1
Heaven's	1
high	1
road;	1
the	1
gray	1
Dawn,	1
and	1
the	1
Pleiades,	1
before	1
him	1
danced,	1
Shedding	1
sweet	1
influence:	1
Less	1
bright	1
the	1
moon,	1
But	1
opposite	1
in	1
levelled	1
west	1
was	1
set,	1
His	1
mirrour,	1
with	1
full	1
face	1
borrowing	1
her	1
light	1
From	1
him;	1
for	1
other	1
light	1
she	1
needed	1
none	1
In	1
that	1
aspect,	1
and	1
still	1
that	1
distance	1
keeps	1
Till	1
night;	1
then	1
in	1
the	1
east	1
her	1
turn	1
she	1
shines,	1
Revolved	1
on	1
Heaven's	1
great	1
axle,	1
and	1
her	1
reign	1
With	1
thousand	1
lesser	1
lights	1
dividual	1
holds,	1
With	1
thousand	1
thousand	1
stars,	1
that	1
then	1
appeared	1
Spangling	1
the	1
hemisphere:	1
Then	1
first	1
adorned	1
With	1
their	1
bright	1
luminaries	1
that	1
set	1
and	1
rose,	1
Glad	1
evening	1
and	1
glad	1
morn	1
crowned	1
the	1
fourth	1
day.	1
And	1
God	1
said,	1
Let	1
the	1
waters	1
generate	1
Reptile	1
with	1
spawn	1
abundant,	1
living	1
soul:	1
And	1
let	1
fowl	1
fly	1
above	1
the	1
Earth,	1
with	1
wings	1
Displayed	1
on	1
the	1
open	1
firmament	1
of	1
Heaven.	1
And	1
God	1
created	1
the	1
great	1
whales,	1
and	1
each	1
Soul	1
living,	1
each	1
that	1
crept,	1
which	1
plenteously	1
The	1
waters	1
generated	1
by	1
their	1
kinds;	1
And	1
every	1
bird	1
of	1
wing	1
after	1
his	1
kind;	1
And	1
saw	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
good,	1
and	1
blessed	1
them,	1
saying.	1
Be	1
fruitful,	1
multiply,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
seas,	1
And	1
lakes,	1
and	1
running	1
streams,	1
the	1
waters	1
fill;	1
And	1
let	1
the	1
fowl	1
be	1
multiplied,	1
on	1
the	1
Earth.	1
Forthwith	1
the	1
sounds	1
and	1
seas,	1
each	1
creek	1
and	1

With	1
fry	1
innumerable	1

Of	1

Hugest	1

Stretched	1
like	1
a	1

Easing	1

Her	1

Solaced	1

The	1

Evening	1

The	1
sixth,	1
and	1
of	1
creation	1

arose	1
With	1
evening	1
harps	1
and	1
matin;	1
when	1
God	1
said,	1
Let	1
the	1
Earth	1
bring	1
forth	1
soul	1
living	1
in	1
her	1
kind,	1
Cattle,	1
and	1
creeping	1
things,	1
and	1
beast	1
of	1
the	1
Earth,	1
Each	1
in	1
their	1
kind.	1
The	1
Earth	1
obeyed,	1
and	1
straight	1
Opening	1
her	1
fertile	1
womb	1
teemed	1
at	1
a	1
birth	1
Innumerous	1
living	1
creatures,	1
perfect	1
forms,	1
Limbed	1
and	1
full	1
grown:	1
Out	1
of	1
the	1
ground	1
up	1
rose,	1
As	1
from	1
his	1
lair,	1
the	1
wild	1
beast	1
where	1
he	1
wons	1
In	1
forest	1
wild,	1
in	1
thicket,	1
brake,	1
or	1
den;	1
Among	1
the	1
trees	1
in	1
pairs	1
they	1
rose,	1
they	1
walked:	1
The	1
cattle	1
in	1
the	1
fields	1
and	1
meadows	1
green:	1
Those	1
rare	1
and	1
solitary,	1
these	1
in	1
flocks	1
Pasturing	1
at	1
once,	1
and	1
in	1
broad	1
herds	1
upsprung.	1
The	1
grassy	1
clods	1
now	1
calved;	1
now	1
half	1
appeared	1
The	1
tawny	1
lion,	1
pawing	1
to	1
get	1
free	1
His	1
hinder	1
parts,	1
then	1
springs	1
as	1
broke	1
from	1
bonds,	1
And	1
rampant	1
shakes	1
his	1
brinded	1
mane;	1
the	1
ounce,	1
The	1
libbard,	1
and	1
the	1
tiger,	1
as	1
the	1
mole	1
Rising,	1
the	1
crumbled	1
earth	1
above	1
them	1
threw	1
In	1
hillocks:	1
The	1
swift	1
stag	1
from	1
under	1

Bore	1
up	1
his	1
branching	1
head:	1
Scarce	1
from	1
his	1

Behemoth	1
biggest	1
born	1
of	1
earth	1
upheaved	1
His	1
vastness:	1
Fleeced	1
the	1
flocks	1
and	1
bleating	1
rose,	1
As	1
plants:	1
Ambiguous	1
between	1
sea	1
and	1
land	1
The	1
river-horse,	1
and	1
scaly	1
crocodile.	1
At	1
once	1
came	1
forth	1
whatever	1
creeps	1
the	1
ground,	1
Insect	1
or	1
worm:	1
those	1
waved	1
their	1
limber	1
fans	1
For	1
wings,	1
and	1
smallest	1
lineaments	1
exact	1
In	1
all	1
the	1
liveries	1
decked	1
of	1
summer's	1
pride	1
With	1
spots	1
of	1
gold	1
and	1
purple,	1
azure	1
and	1
green:	1
These,	1
as	1
a	1
line,	1
their	1
long	1
dimension	1
drew,	1
Streaking	1
the	1
ground	1
with	1
sinuous	1
trace;	1
not	1
all	1
Minims	1
of	1
nature;	1
some	1
of	1
serpent-kind,	1
Wonderous	1
in	1
length	1
and	1
corpulence,	1
involved	1
Their	1
snaky	1
folds,	1
and	1
added	1
wings.	1
First	1
crept	1
The	1
parsimonious	1
emmet,	1
provident	1
Of	1
future;	1
in	1
small	1
room	1
large	1
heart	1
enclosed;	1
Pattern	1
of	1
just	1
equality	1
perhaps	1
Hereafter,	1
joined	1
in	1
her	1
popular	1
tribes	1
Of	1
commonalty:	1
Swarming	1
next	1
appeared	1
The	1
female	1
bee,	1
that	1
feeds	1
her	1
husband	1
drone	1
Deliciously,	1
and	1
builds	1
her	1
waxen	1
cells	1
With	1
honey	1
stored:	1
The	1
rest	1
are	1
numberless,	1
And	1
thou	1
their	1
natures	1
knowest,	1
and	1
gavest	1
them	1
names,	1
Needless	1
to	1
thee	1
repeated;	1
nor	1
unknown	1
The	1
serpent,	1
subtlest	1
beast	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
field,	1
Of	1
huge	1
extent	1
sometimes,	1
with	1
brazen	1
eyes	1
And	1
hairy	1
mane	1
terrifick,	1
though	1
to	1
thee	1
Not	1
noxious,	1
but	1
obedient	1
at	1
thy	1
call.	1
Now	1
Heaven	1
in	1
all	1
her	1
glory	1
shone,	1
and	1
rolled	1
Her	1
motions,	1
as	1
the	1
great	1
first	1
Mover's	1
hand	1
First	1
wheeled	1
their	1
course:	1
Earth	1
in	1
her	1
rich	1
attire	1
Consummate	1
lovely	1
smiled;	1
air,	1
water,	1
earth,	1
By	1
fowl,	1
fish,	1
beast,	1
was	1
flown,	1
was	1
swum,	1
was	1
walked,	1
Frequent;	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
sixth	1
day	1
yet	1
remained:	1
There	1
wanted	1
yet	1
the	1
master-work,	1
the	1
end	1
Of	1
all	1
yet	1
done;	1
a	1
creature,	1
who,	1
not	1
prone	1
And	1
brute	1
as	1
other	1
creatures,	1
but	1
endued	1
With	1
sanctity	1
of	1
reason,	1
might	1
erect	1
His	1
stature,	1
and	1
upright	1
with	1
front	1
serene	1
Govern	1
the	1
rest,	1
self-knowing;	1
and	1
from	1
thence	1
Magnanimous	1
to	1
correspond	1
with	1
Heaven,	1
But	1
grateful	1
to	1
acknowledge	1
whence	1
his	1
good	1
Descends,	1
thither	1
with	1
heart,	1
and	1
voice,	1
and	1
eyes	1
Directed	1
in	1
devotion,	1
to	1
adore	1
And	1
worship	1
God	1
Supreme,	1
who	1
made	1
him	1
chief	1
Of	1
all	1
his	1
works:	1
therefore	1
the	1
Omnipotent	1
Eternal	1
Father	1
(for	1
where	1
is	1
not	1
he	1
Present?)	1
thus	1
to	1
his	1
Son	1
audibly	1
spake.	1
Let	1
us	1
make	1
now	1
Man	1
in	1
our	1
image,	1
Man	1
In	1
our	1
similitude,	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
rule	1
Over	1
the	1
fish	1
and	1
fowl	1
of	1
sea	1
and	1
air,	1
Beast	1
of	1
the	1
field,	1
and	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
Earth,	1
And	1
every	1
creeping	1
thing	1
that	1
creeps	1
the	1
ground.	1
This	1
said,	1
he	1
formed	1
thee,	1
Adam,	1
thee,	1
O	1
Man,	1
Dust	1
of	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
in	1
thy	1
nostrils	1
breathed	1
The	1
breath	1
of	1
life;	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
image	1
he	1
Created	1
thee,	1
in	1
the	1
image	1
of	1
God	1
Express;	1
and	1
thou	1
becamest	1
a	1
living	1
soul.	1
Male	1
he	1
created	1
thee;	1
but	1
thy	1
consort	1
Female,	1
for	1
race;	1
then	1
blessed	1
mankind,	1
and	1
said,	1
Be	1
fruitful,	1
multiply,	1
and	1
fill	1
the	1
Earth;	1
Subdue	1
it,	1
and	1
throughout	1
dominion	1
hold	1
Over	1
fish	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
fowl	1
of	1
the	1
air,	1
And	1
every	1
living	1
thing	1
that	1
moves	1
on	1
the	1
Earth.	1
Wherever	1
thus	1
created,	1
for	1
no	1
place	1
Is	1
yet	1
distinct	1
by	1
name,	1
thence,	1
as	1
thou	1
knowest,	1
He	1
brought	1
thee	1
into	1
this	1
delicious	1
grove,	1
This	1
garden,	1
planted	1
with	1
the	1
trees	1
of	1
God,	1
Delectable	1
both	1
to	1
behold	1
and	1
taste;	1
And	1
freely	1
all	1
their	1
pleasant	1
fruit	1
for	1
food	1
Gave	1
thee;	1
all	1
sorts	1
are	1
here	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
Earth	1
yields,	1
Variety	1
without	1
end;	1
but	1
of	1
the	1
tree,	1
Which,	1
tasted,	1
works	1
knowledge	1
of	1
good	1
and	1
evil,	1
Thou	1
mayest	1
not;	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
thou	1
eatest,	1
thou	1
diest;	1
Death	1
is	1
the	1
penalty	1
imposed;	1
beware,	1
And	1
govern	1
well	1
thy	1
appetite;	1
lest	1
Sin	1
Surprise	1
thee,	1
and	1
her	1
black	1
attendant	1
Death.	1
Here	1
finished	1
he,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
Viewed,	1
and	1
behold	1
all	1
was	1
entirely	1
good;	1
So	1
even	1
and	1
morn	1
accomplished	1
the	1
sixth	1
day:	1
Yet	1
not	1
till	1
the	1
Creator	1
from	1
his	1
work	1
Desisting,	1
though	1
unwearied,	1
up	1
returned,	1
Up	1
to	1
the	1
Heaven	1
of	1
Heavens,	1
his	1
high	1
abode;	1
Thence	1
to	1
behold	1
this	1
new	1
created	1
world,	1
The	1
addition	1
of	1
his	1
empire,	1
how	1
it	1
showed	1
In	1
prospect	1
from	1
his	1
throne,	1
how	1
good,	1
how	1
fair,	1
Answering	1
his	1
great	1
idea.	1
Up	1
he	1
rode	1
Followed	1
with	1
acclamation,	1
and	1
the	1
sound	1
Symphonious	1
of	1
ten	1
thousand	1
harps,	1
that	1
tuned	1
Angelick	1
harmonies:	1
The	1
earth,	1
the	1
air	1
Resounded,	1
(thou	1
rememberest,	1
for	1
thou	1
heardst,)	1
The	1
heavens	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
constellations	1
rung,	1
The	1
planets	1
in	1
their	1
station	1
listening	1
stood,	1
While	1
the	1
bright	1
pomp	1
ascended	1
jubilant.	1
Open,	1
ye	1
everlasting	1
gates!	1
they	1
sung,	1
Open,	1
ye	1
Heavens!	1
your	1
living	1
doors;let	1
in	1
The	1
great	1
Creator	1
from	1
his	1
work	1
returned	1
Magnificent,	1
his	1
six	1
days	1
work,	1
a	1
World;	1
Open,	1
and	1
henceforth	1
oft;	1
for	1
God	1
will	1
deign	1
To	1
visit	1
oft	1
the	1
dwellings	1
of	1
just	1
men,	1
Delighted;	1
and	1
with	1
frequent	1
intercourse	1
Thither	1
will	1
send	1
his	1
winged	1
messengers	1
On	1
errands	1
of	1
supernal	1
grace.	1
So	1
sung	1
The	1
glorious	1
train	1
ascending:	1
He	1
through	1
Heaven,	1
That	1
opened	1
wide	1
her	1
blazing	1
portals,	1
led	1
To	1
God's	1
eternal	1
house	1
direct	1
the	1
way;	1
A	1
broad	1
and	1
ample	1
road,	1
whose	1
dust	1
is	1
gold	1
And	1
pavement	1
stars,	1
as	1
stars	1
to	1
thee	1
appear,	1
Seen	1
in	1
the	1
galaxy,	1
that	1
milky	1
way,	1
Which	1
nightly,	1
as	1
a	1
circling	1
zone,	1
thou	1
seest	1
Powdered	1
with	1
stars.	1
And	1
now	1
on	1
Earth	1
the	1
seventh	1
Evening	1
arose	1
in	1
Eden,	1
for	1
the	1
sun	1
Was	1
set,	1
and	1
twilight	1
from	1
the	1
east	1
came	1
on,	1
Forerunning	1
night;	1
when	1
at	1
the	1
holy	1
mount	1
Of	1
Heaven's	1
high-seated	1
top,	1
the	1
imperial	1
throne	1
Of	1
Godhead,	1
fixed	1
for	1
ever	1
firm	1
and	1
sure,	1
The	1
Filial	1
Power	1
arrived,	1
and	1
sat	1
him	1
down	1
With	1
his	1
great	1
Father;	1
for	1
he	1
also	1
went	1
Invisible,	1
yet	1
staid,	1
(such	1
privilege	1
Hath	1
Omnipresence)	1
and	1
the	1
work	1
ordained,	1
Author	1
and	1
End	1
of	1
all	1
things;	1
and,	1
from	1
work	1
Now	1
resting,	1
blessed	1
and	1
hallowed	1
the	1
seventh	1
day,	1
As	1
resting	1
on	1
that	1
day	1
from	1
all	1
his	1
work,	1
But	1
not	1
in	1
silence	1
holy	1
kept:	1
the	1
harp	1
Had	1
work	1
and	1
rested	1
not;	1
the	1
solemn	1
pipe,	1
And	1
dulcimer,	1
all	1
organs	1
of	1
sweet	1
stop,	1
All	1
sounds	1
on	1
fret	1
by	1
string	1
or	1
golden	1
wire,	1
Tempered	1
soft	1
tunings,	1
intermixed	1
with	1
voice	1
Choral	1
or	1
unison:	1
of	1
incense	1
clouds,	1
Fuming	1
from	1
golden	1
censers,	1
hid	1
the	1
mount.	1
Creation	1
and	1
the	1
six	1
days	1
acts	1
they	1
sung:	1
Great	1
are	1
thy	1
works,	1
Jehovah!	1
infinite	1
Thy	1
power!	1
what	1
thought	1
can	1
measure	1
thee,	1
or	1
tongue	1
Relate	1
thee!	1
Greater	1
now	1
in	1
thy	1
return	1
Than	1
from	1
the	1
giant	1
Angels:	1
Thee	1
that	1
day	1
Thy	1
thunders	1
magnified;	1
but	1
to	1
create	1
Is	1
greater	1
than	1
created	1
to	1
destroy.	1
Who	1
can	1
impair	1
thee,	1
Mighty	1
King,	1
or	1
bound	1
Thy	1
empire!	1
Easily	1
the	1
proud	1
attempt	1
Of	1
Spirits	1
apostate,	1
and	1
their	1
counsels	1
vain,	1
Thou	1
hast	1
repelled;	1
while	1
impiously	1
they	1
thought	1
Thee	1
to	1
diminish,	1
and	1
from	1
thee	1
withdraw	1
The	1
number	1
of	1
thy	1
worshippers.	1
Who	1
seeks	1
To	1
lessen	1
thee,	1
against	1
his	1
purpose	1
serves	1
To	1
manifest	1
the	1
more	1
thy	1
might:	1
his	1
evil	1
Thou	1
usest,	1
and	1
from	1
thence	1
createst	1
more	1
good.	1
Witness	1
this	1
new-made	1
world,	1
another	1
Heaven	1
From	1
Heaven-gate	1
not	1
far,	1
founded	1
in	1
view	1
On	1
the	1
clear	1
hyaline,	1
the	1
glassy	1
sea;	1
Of	1
amplitude	1
almost	1
immense,	1
with	1
stars	1
Numerous,	1
and	1
every	1
star	1
perhaps	1
a	1
world	1
Of	1
destined	1
habitation;	1
but	1
thou	1
knowest	1
Their	1
seasons:	1
among	1
these	1
the	1
seat	1
of	1
Men,	1
Earth,	1
with	1
her	1
nether	1
ocean	1
circumfused,	1
Their	1
pleasant	1
dwelling-place.	1
Thrice	1
happy	1
Men,	1
And	1
sons	1
of	1
Men,	1
whom	1
God	1
hath	1
thus	1
advanced!	1
Created	1
in	1
his	1
image,	1
there	1
to	1
dwell	1
And	1
worship	1
him;	1
and	1
in	1
reward	1
to	1
rule	1
Over	1
his	1
works,	1
on	1
earth,	1
in	1
sea,	1
or	1
air,	1
And	1
multiply	1
a	1
race	1
of	1
worshippers	1
Holy	1
and	1
just:	1
Thrice	1
happy,	1
if	1
they	1
know	1
Their	1
happiness,	1
and	1
persevere	1
upright!	1
So	1
sung	1
they,	1
and	1
the	1
empyrean	1
rung	1
With	1
halleluiahs:	1
Thus	1
was	1
sabbath	1
kept.	1
And	1
thy	1
request	1
think	1
now	1
fulfilled,	1
that	1
asked	1
How	1
first	1
this	1
world	1
and	1
face	1
of	1
things	1
began,	1
And	1
what	1
before	1
thy	1
memory	1
was	1
done	1
From	1
the	1
beginning;	1
that	1
posterity,	1
Informed	1
by	1
thee,	1
might	1
know:	1
If	1
else	1
thou	1
seekest	1
Aught,	1
not	1
surpassing	1
human	1
measure,	1
say.	1
Book	1
VIII	1
The	1
Angel	1
ended,	1
and	1
in	1
Adam's	1
ear	1
So	1
charming	1
left	1
his	1
voice,	1
that	1
he	1
a	1
while	1
Thought	1
him	1
still	1
speaking,	1
still	1
stood	1
fixed	1
to	1
hear;	1
Then,	1
as	1
new	1
waked,	1
thus	1
gratefully	1
replied.	1
What	1
thanks	1
sufficient,	1
or	1
what	1
recompence	1
Equal,	1
have	1
I	1
to	1
render	1
thee,	1
divine	1
Historian,	1
who	1
thus	1
largely	1
hast	1
allayed	1
The	1
thirst	1
I	1
had	1
of	1
knowledge,	1
and	1
vouchsafed	1
This	1
friendly	1
condescension	1
to	1
relate	1
Things,	1
else	1
by	1
me	1
unsearchable;	1
now	1
heard	1
With	1
wonder,	1
but	1
delight,	1
and,	1
as	1
is	1
due,	1
With	1
glory	1
attributed	1
to	1
the	1
high	1
Creator!	1
Something	1
yet	1
of	1
doubt	1
remains,	1
Which	1
only	1
thy	1
solution	1
can	1
resolve.	1
When	1
I	1
behold	1
this	1
goodly	1
frame,	1
this	1
world,	1
Of	1
Heaven	1
and	1
Earth	1
consisting;	1
and	1
compute	1
Their	1
magnitudes;	1
this	1
Earth,	1
a	1
spot,	1
a	1
grain,	1
An	1
atom,	1
with	1
the	1
firmament	1
compared	1
And	1
all	1
her	1
numbered	1
stars,	1
that	1
seem	1
to	1
roll	1
Spaces	1
incomprehensible,	1
(for	1
such	1
Their	1
distance	1
argues,	1
and	1
their	1
swift	1
return	1
Diurnal,)	1
merely	1
to	1
officiate	1
light	1
Round	1
this	1
opacous	1
Earth,	1
this	1
punctual	1
spot,	1
One	1
day	1
and	1
night;	1
in	1
all	1
her	1
vast	1
survey	1
Useless	1
besides;	1
reasoning	1
I	1
oft	1
admire,	1
How	1
Nature	1
wise	1
and	1
frugal	1
could	1
commit	1
Such	1
disproportions,	1
with	1
superfluous	1
hand	1
So	1
many	1
nobler	1
bodies	1
to	1
create,	1
Greater	1
so	1
manifold,	1
to	1
this	1
one	1
use,	1
For	1
aught	1
appears,	1
and	1
on	1
their	1
orbs	1
impose	1
Such	1
restless	1
revolution	1
day	1
by	1
day	1
Repeated;	1
while	1
the	1
sedentary	1
Earth,	1
That	1
better	1
might	1
with	1
far	1
less	1
compass	1
move,	1
Served	1
by	1
more	1
noble	1
than	1
herself,	1
attains	1
Her	1
end	1
without	1
least	1
motion,	1
and	1
receives,	1
As	1
tribute,	1
such	1
a	1
sumless	1
journey	1
brought	1
Of	1
incorporeal	1
speed,	1
her	1
warmth	1
and	1
light;	1
Speed,	1
to	1
describe	1
whose	1
swiftness	1
number	1
fails.	1
So	1
spake	1
our	1
sire,	1
and	1
by	1
his	1
countenance	1
seemed	1
Entering	1
on	1
studious	1
thoughts	1
abstruse;	1
which	1
Eve	1
Perceiving,	1
where	1
she	1
sat	1
retired	1
in	1
sight,	1
With	1
lowliness	1
majestick	1
from	1
her	1
seat,	1
And	1
grace	1
that	1
won	1
who	1
saw	1
to	1
wish	1
her	1
stay,	1
Rose,	1
and	1
went	1
forth	1
among	1
her	1
fruits	1
and	1
flowers,	1
To	1
visit	1
how	1
they	1
prospered,	1
bud	1
and	1
bloom,	1
Her	1
nursery;	1
they	1
at	1
her	1
coming	1
sprung,	1
And,	1
touched	1
by	1
her	1
fair	1
tendance,	1
gladlier	1
grew.	1
Yet	1
went	1
she	1
not,	1
as	1
not	1
with	1
such	1
discourse	1
Delighted,	1
or	1
not	1
capable	1
her	1
ear	1
Of	1
what	1
was	1
high:	1
such	1
pleasure	1
she	1
reserved,	1
Adam	1
relating,	1
she	1
sole	1
auditress;	1
Her	1
husband	1
the	1
relater	1
she	1
preferred	1
Before	1
the	1
Angel,	1
and	1
of	1
him	1
to	1
ask	1
Chose	1
rather;	1
he,	1
she	1
knew,	1
would	1
intermix	1
Grateful	1
digressions,	1
and	1
solve	1
high	1
dispute	1
With	1
conjugal	1
caresses:	1
from	1
his	1
lip	1
Not	1
words	1
alone	1
pleased	1
her.	1
O!	1
when	1
meet	1
now	1
Such	1
pairs,	1
in	1
love	1
and	1
mutual	1
honour	1
joined?	1
With	1
Goddess-like	1
demeanour	1
forth	1
she	1
went,	1
Not	1
unattended;	1
for	1
on	1
her,	1
as	1
Queen,	1
A	1
pomp	1
of	1
winning	1
Graces	1
waited	1
still,	1
And	1
from	1
about	1
her	1
shot	1
darts	1
of	1
desire	1
Into	1
all	1
eyes,	1
to	1
wish	1
her	1
still	1
in	1
sight.	1
And	1
Raphael	1
now,	1
to	1
Adam's	1
doubt	1
proposed,	1
Benevolent	1
and	1
facile	1
thus	1
replied.	1
To	1
ask	1
or	1
search,	1
I	1
blame	1
thee	1
not;	1
for	1
Heaven	1
Is	1
as	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
God	1
before	1
thee	1
set,	1
Wherein	1
to	1
read	1
his	1
wonderous	1
works,	1
and	1
learn	1
His	1
seasons,	1
hours,	1
or	1
days,	1
or	1
months,	1
or	1
years:	1
This	1
to	1
attain,	1
whether	1
Heaven	1
move	1
or	1
Earth,	1
Imports	1
not,	1
if	1
thou	1
reckon	1
right;	1
the	1
rest	1
From	1
Man	1
or	1
Angel	1
the	1
great	1
Architect	1
Did	1
wisely	1
to	1
conceal,	1
and	1
not	1
divulge	1
His	1
secrets	1
to	1
be	1
scanned	1
by	1
them	1
who	1
ought	1
Rather	1
admire;	1
or,	1
if	1
they	1
list	1
to	1
try	1
Conjecture,	1
he	1
his	1
fabrick	1
of	1
the	1
Heavens	1
Hath	1
left	1
to	1
their	1
disputes,	1
perhaps	1
to	1
move	1
His	1
laughter	1
at	1
their	1
quaint	1
opinions	1
wide	1
Hereafter;	1
when	1
they	1
come	1
to	1
model	1
Heaven	1
And	1
calculate	1
the	1
stars,	1
how	1
they	1
will	1
wield	1
The	1
mighty	1
frame;	1
how	1
build,	1
unbuild,	1
contrive	1
To	1
save	1
appearances;	1
how	1
gird	1
the	1
sphere	1
With	1
centrick	1
and	1
eccentrick	1
scribbled	1
o'er,	1
Cycle	1
and	1
epicycle,	1
orb	1
in	1
orb:	1
Already	1
by	1
thy	1
reasoning	1
this	1
I	1
guess,	1
Who	1
art	1
to	1
lead	1
thy	1
offspring,	1
and	1
supposest	1
That	1
bodies	1
bright	1
and	1
greater	1
should	1
not	1
serve	1
The	1
less	1
not	1
bright,	1
nor	1
Heaven	1
such	1
journeys	1
run,	1
Earth	1
sitting	1
still,	1
when	1
she	1
alone	1
receives	1
The	1
benefit:	1
Consider	1
first,	1
that	1
great	1
Or	1
bright	1
infers	1
not	1
excellence:	1
the	1
Earth	1
Though,	1
in	1
comparison	1
of	1
Heaven,	1
so	1
small,	1
Nor	1
glistering,	1
may	1
of	1
solid	1
good	1
contain	1
More	1
plenty	1
than	1
the	1
sun	1
that	1
barren	1
shines;	1
Whose	1
virtue	1
on	1
itself	1
works	1
no	1
effect,	1
But	1
in	1
the	1
fruitful	1
Earth;	1
there	1
first	1
received,	1
His	1
beams,	1
unactive	1
else,	1
their	1
vigour	1
find.	1
Yet	1
not	1
to	1
Earth	1
are	1
those	1
bright	1
luminaries	1
Officious;	1
but	1
to	1
thee,	1
Earth's	1
habitant.	1
And	1
for	1
the	1
Heaven's	1
wide	1
circuit,	1
let	1
it	1
speak	1
The	1
Maker's	1
high	1
magnificence,	1
who	1
built	1
So	1
spacious,	1
and	1
his	1
line	1
stretched	1
out	1
so	1
far;	1
That	1
Man	1
may	1
know	1
he	1
dwells	1
not	1
in	1
his	1
own;	1
An	1
edifice	1
too	1
large	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
fill,	1
Lodged	1
in	1
a	1
small	1
partition;	1
and	1
the	1
rest	1
Ordained	1
for	1
uses	1
to	1
his	1
Lord	1
best	1
known.	1
The	1
swiftness	1
of	1
those	1
circles	1
attribute,	1
Though	1
numberless,	1
to	1
his	1
Omnipotence,	1
That	1
to	1
corporeal	1
substances	1
could	1
add	1
Speed	1
almost	1
spiritual:	1
Me	1
thou	1
thinkest	1
not	1
slow,	1
Who	1
since	1
the	1
morning-hour	1
set	1
out	1
from	1
Heaven	1
Where	1
God	1
resides,	1
and	1
ere	1
mid-day	1
arrived	1
In	1
Eden;	1
distance	1
inexpressible	1
By	1
numbers	1
that	1
have	1
name.	1
But	1
this	1
I	1
urge,	1
Admitting	1
motion	1
in	1
the	1
Heavens,	1
to	1
show	1
Invalid	1
that	1
which	1
thee	1
to	1
doubt	1
it	1
moved;	1
Not	1
that	1
I	1
so	1
affirm,	1
though	1
so	1
it	1
seem	1
To	1
thee	1
who	1
hast	1
thy	1
dwelling	1
here	1
on	1
Earth.	1
God,	1
to	1
remove	1
his	1
ways	1
from	1
human	1
sense,	1
Placed	1
Heaven	1
from	1
Earth	1
so	1
far,	1
that	1
earthly	1
sight,	1
If	1
it	1
presume,	1
might	1
err	1
in	1
things	1
too	1
high,	1
And	1
no	1
advantage	1
gain.	1
What	1
if	1
the	1
sun	1
Be	1
center	1
to	1
the	1
world;	1
and	1
other	1
stars,	1
By	1
his	1
attractive	1
virtue	1
and	1
their	1
own	1
Incited,	1
dance	1
about	1
him	1
various	1
rounds?	1
Their	1
wandering	1
course	1
now	1
high,	1
now	1
low,	1
then	1
hid,	1
Progressive,	1
retrograde,	1
or	1
standing	1
still,	1
In	1
six	1
thou	1
seest;	1
and	1
what	1
if	1
seventh	1
to	1
these	1
The	1
planet	1
earth,	1
so	1
stedfast	1
though	1
she	1
seem,	1
Insensibly	1
three	1
different	1
motions	1
move?	1
Which	1
else	1
to	1
several	1
spheres	1
thou	1
must	1
ascribe,	1
Moved	1
contrary	1
with	1
thwart	1
obliquities;	1
Or	1
save	1
the	1
sun	1
his	1
labour,	1
and	1
that	1
swift	1
Nocturnal	1
and	1
diurnal	1
rhomb	1
supposed,	1
Invisible	1
else	1
above	1
all	1
stars,	1
the	1
wheel	1
Of	1
day	1
and	1
night;	1
which	1
needs	1
not	1
thy	1
belief,	1
If	1
earth,	1
industrious	1
of	1
herself,	1
fetch	1
day	1
Travelling	1
east,	1
and	1
with	1
her	1
part	1
averse	1
From	1
the	1
sun's	1
beam	1
meet	1
night,	1
her	1
other	1
part	1
Still	1
luminous	1
by	1
his	1
ray.	1
What	1
if	1
that	1
light,	1
Sent	1
from	1
her	1
through	1
the	1
wide	1
transpicuous	1
air,	1
To	1
the	1
terrestrial	1
moon	1
be	1
as	1
a	1
star,	1
Enlightening	1
her	1
by	1
day,	1
as	1
she	1
by	1
night	1
This	1
earth?	1
reciprocal,	1
if	1
land	1
be	1
there,	1
Fields	1
and	1
inhabitants:	1
Her	1
spots	1
thou	1
seest	1
As	1
clouds,	1
and	1
clouds	1
may	1
rain,	1
and	1
rain	1
produce	1
Fruits	1
in	1
her	1
softened	1
soil	1
for	1
some	1
to	1
eat	1
Allotted	1
there;	1
and	1
other	1
suns	1
perhaps,	1
With	1
their	1
attendant	1
moons,	1
thou	1
wilt	1
descry,	1
Communicating	1
male	1
and	1
female	1
light;	1
Which	1
two	1
great	1
sexes	1
animate	1
the	1
world,	1
Stored	1
in	1
each	1
orb	1
perhaps	1
with	1
some	1
that	1
live.	1
For	1
such	1
vast	1
room	1
in	1
Nature	1
unpossessed	1
By	1
living	1
soul,	1
desart	1
and	1
desolate,	1
Only	1
to	1
shine,	1
yet	1
scarce	1
to	1
contribute	1
Each	1
orb	1
a	1
glimpse	1
of	1
light,	1
conveyed	1
so	1
far	1
Down	1
to	1
this	1
habitable,	1
which	1
returns	1
Light	1
back	1
to	1
them,	1
is	1
obvious	1
to	1
dispute.	1
But	1
whether	1
thus	1
these	1
things,	1
or	1
whether	1
not;	1
But	1
whether	1
the	1
sun,	1
predominant	1
in	1
Heaven,	1
Rise	1
on	1
the	1
earth;	1
or	1
earth	1
rise	1
on	1
the	1
sun;	1
He	1
from	1
the	1
east	1
his	1
flaming	1
road	1
begin;	1
Or	1
she	1
from	1
west	1
her	1
silent	1
course	1
advance,	1
With	1
inoffensive	1
pace	1
that	1
spinning	1
sleeps	1
On	1
her	1
soft	1
axle,	1
while	1
she	1
paces	1
even,	1
And	1
bears	1
thee	1
soft	1
with	1
the	1
smooth	1
hair	1
along;	1
Sollicit	1
not	1
thy	1
thoughts	1
with	1
matters	1
hid;	1
Leave	1
them	1
to	1
God	1
above;	1
him	1
serve,	1
and	1
fear!	1
Of	1
other	1
creatures,	1
as	1
him	1
pleases	1
best,	1
Wherever	1
placed,	1
let	1
him	1
dispose;	1
joy	1
thou	1
In	1
what	1
he	1
gives	1
to	1
thee,	1
this	1
Paradise	1
And	1
thy	1
fair	1
Eve;	1
Heaven	1
is	1
for	1
thee	1
too	1
high	1
To	1
know	1
what	1
passes	1
there;	1
be	1
lowly	1
wise:	1
Think	1
only	1
what	1
concerns	1
thee,	1
and	1
thy	1
being;	1
Dream	1
not	1
of	1
other	1
worlds,	1
what	1
creatures	1
there	1
Live,	1
in	1
what	1
state,	1
condition,	1
or	1
degree;	1
Contented	1
that	1
thus	1
far	1
hath	1
been	1
revealed	1
Not	1
of	1
Earth	1
only,	1
but	1
of	1
highest	1
Heaven.	1
To	1
whom	1
thus	1
Adam,	1
cleared	1
of	1
doubt,	1
replied.	1
How	1
fully	1
hast	1
thou	1
satisfied	1
me,	1
pure	1
Intelligence	1
of	1
Heaven,	1
Angel	1
serene!	1
And,	1
freed	1
from	1
intricacies,	1
taught	1
to	1
live	1
The	1
easiest	1
way;	1
nor	1
with	1
perplexing	1
thoughts	1
To	1
interrupt	1
the	1
sweet	1
of	1
life,	1
from	1
which	1
God	1
hath	1
bid	1
dwell	1
far	1
off	1
all	1
anxious	1
cares,	1
And	1
not	1
molest	1
us;	1
unless	1
we	1
ourselves	1
Seek	1
them	1
with	1
wandering	1
thoughts,	1
and	1
notions	1
vain.	1
But	1
apt	1
the	1
mind	1
or	1
fancy	1
is	1
to	1
rove	1
Unchecked,	1
and	1
of	1
her	1
roving	1
is	1
no	1
end;	1
Till	1
warned,	1
or	1
by	1
experience	1
taught,	1
she	1
learn,	1
That,	1
not	1
to	1
know	1
at	1
large	1
of	1
things	1
remote	1
From	1
use,	1
obscure	1
and	1
subtle;	1
but,	1
to	1
know	1
That	1
which	1
before	1
us	1
lies	1
in	1
daily	1
life,	1
Is	1
the	1
prime	1
wisdom:	1
What	1
is	1
more,	1
is	1
fume,	1
Or	1
emptiness,	1
or	1
fond	1
impertinence:	1
And	1
renders	1
us,	1
in	1
things	1
that	1
most	1
concern,	1
Unpractised,	1
unprepared,	1
and	1
still	1
to	1
seek.	1
Therefore	1
from	1
this	1
high	1
pitch	1
let	1
us	1
descend	1
A	1
lower	1
flight,	1
and	1
speak	1
of	1
things	1
at	1
hand	1
Useful;	1
whence,	1
haply,	1
mention	1
may	1
arise	1
Of	1
something	1
not	1
unseasonable	1
to	1
ask,	1
By	1
sufferance,	1
and	1
thy	1
wonted	1
favour,	1
deigned.	1
Thee	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
relating	1
what	1
was	1
done	1
Ere	1
my	1
remembrance:	1
now,	1
hear	1
me	1
relate	1
My	1
story,	1
which	1
perhaps	1
thou	1
hast	1
not	1
heard;	1
And	1
day	1
is	1
not	1
yet	1
spent;	1
till	1
then	1
thou	1
seest	1
How	1
subtly	1
to	1
detain	1
thee	1
I	1
devise;	1
Inviting	1
thee	1
to	1
hear	1
while	1
I	1
relate;	1
Fond!	1
were	1
it	1
not	1
in	1
hope	1
of	1
thy	1
reply:	1
For,	1
while	1
I	1
sit	1
with	1
thee,	1
I	1
seem	1
in	1
Heaven;	1
And	1
sweeter	1
thy	1
discourse	1
is	1
to	1
my	1
ear	1
Than	1
fruits	1
of	1
palm-tree	1
pleasantest	1
to	1
thirst	1
And	1
hunger	1
both,	1
from	1
labour,	1
at	1
the	1
hour	1
Of	1
sweet	1
repast;	1
they	1
satiate,	1
and	1
soon	1
fill,	1
Though	1
pleasant;	1
but	1
thy	1
words,	1
with	1
grace	1
divine	1
Imbued,	1
bring	1
to	1
their	1
sweetness	1
no	1
satiety.	1
To	1
whom	1
thus	1
Raphael	1
answered	1
heavenly	1
meek.	1
Nor	1
are	1
thy	1
lips	1
ungraceful,	1
Sire	1
of	1
men,	1
Nor	1
tongue	1
ineloquent;	1
for	1
God	1
on	1
thee	1
Abundantly	1
his	1
gifts	1
hath	1
also	1
poured	1
Inward	1
and	1
outward	1
both,	1
his	1
image	1
fair:	1
Speaking,	1
or	1
mute,	1
all	1
comeliness	1
and	1
grace	1
Attends	1
thee;	1
and	1
each	1
word,	1
each	1
motion,	1
forms;	1
Nor	1
less	1
think	1
we	1
in	1
Heaven	1
of	1
thee	1
on	1
Earth	1
Than	1
of	1
our	1
fellow-servant,	1
and	1
inquire	1
Gladly	1
into	1
the	1
ways	1
of	1
God	1
with	1
Man:	1
For	1
God,	1
we	1
see,	1
hath	1
honoured	1
thee,	1
and	1
set	1
On	1
Man	1
his	1
equal	1
love:	1
Say	1
therefore	1
on;	1
For	1
I	1
that	1
day	1
was	1
absent,	1
as	1
befel,	1
Bound	1
on	1
a	1
voyage	1
uncouth	1
and	1
obscure,	1
Far	1
on	1
excursion	1
toward	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
Hell;	1
Squared	1
in	1
full	1
legion	1
(such	1
command	1
we	1
had)	1
To	1
see	1
that	1
none	1
thence	1
issued	1
forth	1
a	1
spy,	1
Or	1
enemy,	1
while	1
God	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
work;	1
Lest	1
he,	1
incensed	1
at	1
such	1
eruption	1
bold,	1
Destruction	1
with	1
creation	1
might	1
have	1
mixed.	1
Not	1
that	1
they	1
durst	1
without	1
his	1
leave	1
attempt;	1
But	1
us	1
he	1
sends	1
upon	1
his	1
high	1
behests	1
For	1
state,	1
as	1
Sovran	1
King;	1
and	1
to	1
inure	1
Our	1
prompt	1
obedience.	1
Fast	1
we	1
found,	1
fast	1
shut,	1
The	1
dismal	1
gates,	1
and	1
barricadoed	1
strong;	1
But	1
long	1
ere	1
our	1
approaching	1
heard	1
within	1
Noise,	1
other	1
than	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
dance	1
or	1
song,	1
Torment,	1
and	1
loud	1
lament,	1
and	1
furious	1
rage.	1
Glad	1
we	1
returned	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
coasts	1
of	1
light	1
Ere	1
sabbath-evening:	1
so	1
we	1
had	1
in	1
charge.	1
But	1
thy	1
relation	1
now;	1
for	1
I	1
attend,	1
Pleased	1
with	1
thy	1
words	1
no	1
less	1
than	1
thou	1
with	1
mine.	1
So	1
spake	1
the	1
Godlike	1
Power,	1
and	1
thus	1
our	1
Sire.	1
For	1
Man	1
to	1
tell	1
how	1
human	1
life	1
began	1
Is	1
hard;	1
for	1
who	1
himself	1
beginning	1
knew	1
Desire	1
with	1
thee	1
still	1
longer	1
to	1
converse	1
Induced	1
me.	1
As	1
new	1
waked	1
from	1
soundest	1
sleep,	1
Soft	1
on	1
the	1
flowery	1
herb	1
I	1
found	1
me	1
laid,	1
In	1
balmy	1
sweat;	1
which	1
with	1
his	1
beams	1
the	1
sun	1
Soon	1
dried,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
reeking	1
moisture	1
fed.	1
Straight	1
toward	1
Heaven	1
my	1
wondering	1
eyes	1
I	1
turned,	1
And	1
gazed	1
a	1
while	1
the	1
ample	1
sky;	1
till,	1
raised	1
By	1
quick	1
instinctive	1
motion,	1
up	1
I	1
sprung,	1
As	1
thitherward	1
endeavouring,	1
and	1
upright	1
Stood	1
on	1
my	1
feet:	1
about	1
me	1
round	1
I	1
saw	1
Hill,	1
dale,	1
and	1
shady	1
woods,	1
and	1
sunny	1
plains,	1
And	1
liquid	1
lapse	1
of	1
murmuring	1
streams;	1
by	1
these,	1
Creatures	1
that	1
lived	1
and	1
moved,	1
and	1
walked,	1
or	1
flew;	1
Birds	1
on	1
the	1
branches	1
warbling;	1
all	1
things	1
smiled;	1
With	1
fragrance	1
and	1
with	1
joy	1
my	1
heart	1
o'erflowed.	1
Myself	1
I	1
then	1
perused,	1
and	1
limb	1
by	1
limb	1
Surveyed,	1
and	1
sometimes	1
went,	1
and	1
sometimes	1
ran	1
With	1
supple	1
joints,	1
as	1
lively	1
vigour	1
led:	1
But	1
who	1
I	1
was,	1
or	1
where,	1
or	1
from	1
what	1
cause,	1
Knew	1
not;	1
to	1
speak	1
I	1
tried,	1
and	1
forthwith	1
spake;	1
My	1
tongue	1
obeyed,	1
and	1
readily	1
could	1
name	1
Whate'er	1
I	1
saw.	1
Thou	1
Sun,	1
said	1
I,	1
fair	1
light,	1
And	1
thou	1
enlightened	1
Earth,	1
so	1
fresh	1
and	1
gay,	1
Ye	1
Hills,	1
and	1
Dales,	1
ye	1
Rivers,	1
Woods,	1
and	1
Plains,	1
And	1
ye	1
that	1
live	1
and	1
move,	1
fair	1
Creatures,	1
tell,	1
Tell,	1
if	1
ye	1
saw,	1
how	1
I	1
came	1
thus,	1
how	1
here?--	1
Not	1
of	1
myself;--by	1
some	1
great	1
Maker	1
then,	1
In	1
goodness	1
and	1
in	1
power	1
pre-eminent:	1
Tell	1
me,	1
how	1
may	1
I	1
know	1
him,	1
how	1
adore,	1
From	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
that	1
thus	1
I	1
move	1
and	1
live,	1
And	1
feel	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
happier	1
than	1
I	1
know.--	1
While	1
thus	1
I	1
called,	1
and	1
strayed	1
I	1
knew	1
not	1
whither,	1
From	1
where	1
I	1
first	1
drew	1
air,	1
and	1
first	1
beheld	1
This	1
happy	1
light;	1
when,	1
answer	1
none	1
returned,	1
On	1
a	1
green	1
shady	1
bank,	1
profuse	1
of	1
flowers,	1
Pensive	1
I	1
sat	1
me	1
down:	1
There	1
gentle	1
sleep	1
First	1
found	1
me,	1
and	1
with	1
soft	1
oppression	1
seised	1
My	1
droused	1
sense,	1
untroubled,	1
though	1
I	1
thought	1
I	1
then	1
was	1
passing	1
to	1
my	1
former	1
state	1
Insensible,	1
and	1
forthwith	1
to	1
dissolve:	1
When	1
suddenly	1
stood	1
at	1
my	1
head	1
a	1
dream,	1
Whose	1
inward	1
apparition	1
gently	1
moved	1
My	1
fancy	1
to	1
believe	1
I	1
yet	1
had	1
being,	1
And	1
lived:	1
One	1
came,	1
methought,	1
of	1
shape	1
divine,	1
And	1
said,	1
'Thy	1
mansion	1
wants	1
thee,	1
Adam;	1
rise,	1
'First	1
Man,	1
of	1
men	1
innumerable	1
ordained	1
'First	1
Father!	1
called	1
by	1
thee,	1
I	1
come	1
thy	1
guide	1
'To	1
the	1
garden	1
of	1
bliss,	1
thy	1
seat	1
prepared.'	1
So	1
saying,	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
he	1
took	1
me	1
raised,	1
And	1
over	1
fields	1
and	1
waters,	1
as	1
in	1
air	1
Smooth-sliding	1
without	1
step,	1
last	1
led	1
me	1
up	1
A	1
woody	1
mountain;	1
whose	1
high	1
top	1
was	1
plain,	1
A	1
circuit	1
wide,	1
enclosed,	1
with	1
goodliest	1
trees	1
Planted,	1
with	1
walks,	1
and	1
bowers;	1
that	1
what	1
I	1
saw	1
Of	1
Earth	1
before	1
scarce	1
pleasant	1
seemed.	1
Each	1
tree,	1
Loaden	1
with	1
fairest	1
fruit	1
that	1
hung	1
to	1
the	1
eye	1
Tempting,	1
stirred	1
in	1
me	1
sudden	1
appetite	1
To	1
pluck	1
and	1
eat;	1
whereat	1
I	1
waked,	1
and	1
found	1
Before	1
mine	1
eyes	1
all	1
real,	1
as	1
the	1
dream	1
Had	1
lively	1
shadowed:	1
Here	1
had	1
new	1
begun	1
My	1
wandering,	1
had	1
not	1
he,	1
who	1
was	1
my	1
guide	1
Up	1
hither,	1
from	1
among	1
the	1
trees	1
appeared,	1
Presence	1
Divine.	1
Rejoicing,	1
but	1
with	1
awe,	1
In	1
adoration	1
at	1
his	1
feet	1
I	1
fell	1
Submiss:	1
He	1
reared	1
me,	1
and	1
'Whom	1
thou	1
soughtest	1
I	1
am,'	1
Said	1
mildly,	1
'Author	1
of	1
all	1
this	1
thou	1
seest	1
'Above,	1
or	1
round	1
about	1
thee,	1
or	1
beneath.	1
'This	1
Paradise	1
I	1
give	1
thee,	1
count	1
it	1
thine	1
'To	1
till	1
and	1
keep,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
fruit	1
to	1
eat:	1
'Of	1
every	1
tree	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
garden	1
grows	1
'Eat	1
freely	1
with	1
glad	1
heart;	1
fear	1
here	1
no	1
dearth:	1
'But	1
of	1
the	1
tree	1
whose	1
operation	1
brings	1
'Knowledge	1
of	1
good	1
and	1
ill,	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
set	1
'The	1
pledge	1
of	1
thy	1
obedience	1
and	1
thy	1
faith,	1
'Amid	1
the	1
garden	1
by	1
the	1
tree	1
of	1
life,	1
'Remember	1
what	1
I	1
warn	1
thee,	1
shun	1
to	1
taste,	1
'And	1
shun	1
the	1
bitter	1
consequence:	1
for	1
know,	1
'The	1
day	1
thou	1
eatest	1
thereof,	1
my	1
sole	1
command	1
'Transgressed,	1
inevitably	1
thou	1
shalt	1
die,	1
'From	1
that	1
day	1
mortal;	1

this	1
happy	1
state	1
'Shalt	1
lose,	1
expelled	1
from	1
hence	1
into	1
a	1
world	1
'Of	1
woe	1
and	1
sorrow.'	1
Sternly	1
he	1
pronounced	1
The	1
rigid	1
interdiction,	1
which	1
resounds	1
Yet	1
dreadful	1
in	1
mine	1
ear,	1
though	1
in	1
my	1
choice	1
Not	1
to	1
incur;	1
but	1
soon	1
his	1
clear	1
aspect	1
Returned,	1
and	1
gracious	1
purpose	1
thus	1
renewed.	1
'Not	1
only	1
these	1
fair	1
bounds,	1
but	1
all	1
the	1
Earth	1
'To	1
thee	1
and	1
to	1
thy	1
race	1
I	1
give;	1
as	1
lords	1
'Possess	1
it,	1
and	1
all	1
things	1
that	1
therein	1
live,	1
'Or	1
live	1
in	1
sea,	1
or	1
air;	1
beast,	1
fish,	1
and	1
fowl.	1
'In	1
sign	1
whereof,	1
each	1
bird	1
and	1
beast	1
behold	1
'After	1
their	1
kinds;	1
I	1
bring	1
them	1
to	1
receive	1
'From	1
thee	1
their	1
names,	1
and	1
pay	1
thee	1
fealty	1
'With	1
low	1
subjection;	1
understand	1
the	1
same	1
'Of	1

their	1

residence,	1
'Not	1
hither	1
summoned,	1
since	1
they	1
cannot	1
change	1
'Their	1
element,	1
to	1
draw	1
the	1
thinner	1
air.'	1
As	1
thus	1
he	1
spake,	1
each	1
bird	1
and	1
beast	1
behold	1
Approaching	1
two	1
and	1
two;	1
these	1
cowering	1
low	1
With	1
blandishment;	1
each	1
bird	1
stooped	1
on	1
his	1
wing.	1
I	1
named	1
them,	1
as	1
they	1
passed,	1
and	1
understood	1
Their	1
nature,	1
with	1
such	1
knowledge	1
God	1
endued	1
My	1
sudden	1
apprehension:	1
But	1
in	1
these	1
I	1
found	1
not	1
what	1
methought	1
I	1
wanted	1
still;	1
And	1
to	1
the	1
heavenly	1
Vision	1
thus	1
presumed.	1
O,	1
by	1
what	1
name,	1
for	1
thou	1
above	1
all	1
these,	1
Above	1
mankind,	1
or	1
aught	1
than	1
mankind	1
higher,	1
Surpassest	1
far	1
my	1
naming;	1
how	1
may	1
I	1
Adore	1
thee,	1
Author	1
of	1
this	1
universe,	1
And	1
all	1
this	1
good	1
to	1
man?	1
for	1
whose	1
well	1
being	1
So	1
amply,	1
and	1
with	1
hands	1
so	1
liberal,	1
Thou	1
hast	1
provided	1
all	1
things:	1
But	1
with	1
me	1
I	1
see	1
not	1
who	1
partakes.	1
In	1
solitude	1
What	1
happiness,	1
who	1
can	1
enjoy	1
alone,	1
Or,	1
all	1
enjoying,	1
what	1
contentment	1
find?	1
Thus	1
I	1
presumptuous;	1
and	1
the	1
Vision	1
bright,	1
As	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
more	1
brightened,	1
thus	1
replied.	1
What	1
callest	1
thou	1
solitude?	1
Is	1
not	1
the	1
Earth	1
With	1
various	1
living	1
creatures,	1
and	1
the	1
air	1
Replenished,	1
and	1
all	1
these	1
at	1
thy	1
command	1
To	1
come	1
and	1
play	1
before	1
thee?	1
Knowest	1
thou	1
not	1
Their	1
language	1
and	1
their	1
ways?	1
They	1
also	1
know,	1
And	1
reason	1
not	1
contemptibly:	1
With	1
these	1
Find	1
pastime,	1
and	1
bear	1
rule;	1
thy	1
realm	1
is	1
large.	1
So	1
spake	1
the	1
Universal	1
Lord,	1
and	1
seemed	1
So	1
ordering:	1
I,	1
with	1
leave	1
of	1
speech	1
implored,	1
And	1
humble	1
deprecation,	1
thus	1
replied.	1
Let	1
not	1
my	1
words	1
offend	1
thee,	1
Heavenly	1
Power;	1
My	1
Maker,	1
be	1
propitious	1
while	1
I	1
speak.	1
Hast	1
thou	1
not	1
made	1
me	1
here	1
thy	1
substitute,	1
And	1
these	1
inferiour	1
far	1
beneath	1
me	1
set?	1
Among	1
unequals	1
what	1
society	1
Can	1
sort,	1
what	1
harmony,	1
or	1
true	1
delight?	1
Which	1
must	1
be	1
mutual,	1
in	1
proportion	1
due	1
Given	1
and	1
received;	1
but,	1
in	1
disparity	1
The	1
one	1
intense,	1
the	1
other	1
still	1
remiss,	1
Cannot	1
well	1
suit	1
with	1
either,	1
but	1
soon	1
prove	1
Tedious	1
alike:	1
Of	1
fellowship	1
I	1
speak	1
Such	1
as	1
I	1
seek,	1
fit	1
to	1
participate	1
All	1
rational	1
delight:	1
wherein	1
the	1
brute	1
Cannot	1
be	1
human	1
consort:	1
They	1
rejoice	1
Each	1
with	1
their	1
kind,	1
lion	1
with	1
lioness;	1
So	1
fitly	1
them	1
in	1
pairs	1
thou	1
hast	1
combined:	1
Much	1
less	1
can	1
bird	1
with	1
beast,	1
or	1
fish	1
with	1
fowl	1
So	1
well	1
converse,	1
nor	1
with	1
the	1
ox	1
the	1
ape;	1
Worse	1
then	1
can	1
man	1
with	1
beast,	1
and	1
least	1
of	1
all.	1
Whereto	1
the	1
Almighty	1
answered,	1
not	1
displeased.	1
A	1
nice	1
and	1
subtle	1
happiness,	1
I	1
see,	1
Thou	1
to	1
thyself	1
proposest,	1
in	1
the	1
choice	1
Of	1
thy	1
associates,	1
Adam!	1
and	1
wilt	1
taste	1
No	1
pleasure,	1
though	1
in	1
pleasure,	1
solitary.	1
What	1
thinkest	1
thou	1
then	1
of	1
me,	1
and	1
this	1
my	1
state?	1
Seem	1
I	1
to	1
thee	1
sufficiently	1
possessed	1
Of	1
happiness,	1
or	1
not?	1
who	1
am	1
alone	1
From	1
all	1
eternity;	1
for	1
none	1
I	1
know	1
Second	1
to	1
me	1
or	1
like,	1
equal	1
much	1
less.	1
How	1
have	1
I	1
then	1
with	1
whom	1
to	1
hold	1
converse,	1
Save	1
with	1
the	1
creatures	1
which	1
I	1
made,	1
and	1
those	1
To	1
me	1
inferiour,	1
infinite	1
descents	1
Beneath	1
what	1
other	1
creatures	1
are	1
to	1
thee?	1
He	1
ceased;	1
I	1
lowly	1
answered.	1
To	1
attain	1
The	1
highth	1
and	1
depth	1
of	1
thy	1
eternal	1
ways	1
All	1
human	1
thoughts	1
come	1
short,	1
Supreme	1
of	1
things!	1
Thou	1
in	1
thyself	1
art	1
perfect,	1
and	1
in	1
thee	1
Is	1
no	1
deficience	1
found:	1
Not	1
so	1
is	1
Man,	1
But	1
in	1
degree;	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
his	1
desire	1
By	1
conversation	1
with	1
his	1
like	1
to	1
help	1
Or	1
solace	1
his	1
defects.	1
No	1
need	1
that	1
thou	1
Shouldst	1
propagate,	1
already	1
Infinite;	1
And	1
through	1
all	1
numbers	1
absolute,	1
though	1
One:	1
But	1
Man	1
by	1
number	1
is	1
to	1
manifest	1
His	1
single	1
imperfection,	1
and	1
beget	1
Like	1
of	1
his	1
like,	1
his	1
image	1
multiplied,	1
In	1
unity	1
defective;	1
which	1
requires	1
Collateral	1
love,	1
and	1
dearest	1
amity.	1
Thou	1
in	1
thy	1
secresy	1
although	1
alone,	1
Best	1
with	1
thyself	1
accompanied,	1
seekest	1
not	1
Social	1
communication;	1
yet,	1
so	1
pleased,	1
Canst	1
raise	1
thy	1
creature	1
to	1
what	1
highth	1
thou	1
wilt	1
Of	1
union	1
or	1
communion,	1
deified:	1
I,	1
by	1
conversing,	1
cannot	1
these	1
erect	1
From	1
prone;	1
nor	1
in	1
their	1
ways	1
complacence	1
find.	1
Thus	1
I	1
emboldened	1
spake,	1
and	1
freedom	1
used	1
Permissive,	1
and	1
acceptance	1
found;	1
which	1
gained	1
This	1
answer	1
from	1
the	1
gracious	1
Voice	1
Divine.	1
Thus	1
far	1
to	1
try	1
thee,	1
Adam,	1
I	1
was	1
pleased;	1
And	1
find	1
thee	1
knowing,	1
not	1
of	1
beasts	1
alone,	1
Which	1
thou	1
hast	1
rightly	1
named,	1
but	1
of	1
thyself;	1
Expressing	1
well	1
the	1
spirit	1
within	1
thee	1
free,	1
My	1
image,	1
not	1
imparted	1
to	1
the	1
brute;	1
Whose	1
fellowship	1
therefore	1
unmeet	1
for	1
thee	1
Good	1
reason	1
was	1
thou	1
freely	1
shouldst	1
dislike;	1
And	1
be	1
so	1
minded	1
still:	1
I,	1
ere	1
thou	1
spakest,	1
Knew	1
it	1
not	1
good	1
for	1
Man	1
to	1
be	1
alone;	1
And	1
no	1
such	1
company	1
as	1
then	1
thou	1
sawest	1
Intended	1
thee;	1
for	1
trial	1
only	1
brought,	1
To	1
see	1
how	1
thou	1
couldest	1
judge	1
of	1
fit	1
and	1
meet:	1
What	1
next	1
I	1
bring	1
shall	1
please	1
thee,	1
be	1
assured,	1
Thy	1
likeness,	1
thy	1
fit	1
help,	1
thy	1
other	1
self,	1
Thy	1
wish	1
exactly	1
to	1
thy	1
heart's	1
desire.	1
He	1
ended,	1
or	1
I	1
heard	1
no	1
more;	1
for	1
now	1
My	1
earthly	1
by	1
his	1
heavenly	1
overpowered,	1
Which	1
it	1
had	1
long	1
stood	1
under,	1
strained	1
to	1
the	1
highth	1
In	1
that	1
celestial	1
colloquy	1
sublime,	1
As	1
with	1
an	1
object	1
that	1
excels	1
the	1
sense	1
Dazzled	1
and	1
spent,	1
sunk	1
down;	1
and	1
sought	1
repair	1
Of	1
sleep,	1
which	1
instantly	1
fell	1
on	1
me,	1
called	1
By	1
Nature	1
as	1
in	1
aid,	1
and	1
closed	1
mine	1
eyes.	1
Mine	1
eyes	1
he	1
closed,	1
but	1
open	1
left	1
the	1
cell	1
Of	1
fancy,	1
my	1
internal	1
sight;	1
by	1
which,	1
Abstract	1
as	1
in	1
a	1
trance,	1
methought	1
I	1
saw,	1
Though	1
sleeping,	1
where	1
I	1
lay,	1
and	1
saw	1
the	1
shape	1
Still	1
glorious	1
before	1
whom	1
awake	1
I	1
stood:	1
Who	1
stooping	1
opened	1
my	1
left	1
side,	1
and	1
took	1
From	1
thence	1
a	1
rib,	1
with	1
cordial	1
spirits	1
warm,	1
And	1
life-blood	1
streaming	1
fresh;	1
wide	1
was	1
the	1
wound,	1
But	1
suddenly	1
with	1
flesh	1
filled	1
up	1
and	1
healed:	1
The	1
rib	1
he	1
formed	1
and	1
fashioned	1
with	1
his	1
hands;	1
Under	1
his	1
forming	1
hands	1
a	1
creature	1
grew,	1
Man-like,	1
but	1
different	1
sex;	1
so	1
lovely	1
fair,	1
That	1
what	1
seemed	1
fair	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
world,	1
seemed	1
now	1
Mean,	1
or	1
in	1
her	1
summed	1
up,	1
in	1
her	1
contained	1
And	1
in	1
her	1
looks;	1
which	1
from	1
that	1
time	1
infused	1
Sweetness	1
into	1
my	1
heart,	1
unfelt	1
before,	1
And	1
into	1
all	1
things	1
from	1
her	1
air	1
inspired	1
The	1
spirit	1
of	1
love	1
and	1
amorous	1
delight.	1
She	1
disappeared,	1
and	1
left	1
me	1
dark;	1
I	1
waked	1
To	1
find	1
her,	1
or	1
for	1
ever	1
to	1
deplore	1
Her	1
loss,	1
and	1
other	1
pleasures	1
all	1
abjure:	1
When	1
out	1
of	1
hope,	1
behold	1
her,	1
not	1
far	1
off,	1
Such	1
as	1
I	1
saw	1
her	1
in	1
my	1
dream,	1
adorned	1
With	1
what	1
all	1
Earth	1
or	1
Heaven	1
could	1
bestow	1
To	1
make	1
her	1
amiable:	1
On	1
she	1
came,	1
Led	1
by	1
her	1
heavenly	1
Maker,	1
though	1
unseen,	1
And	1
guided	1
by	1
his	1
voice;	1
nor	1
uninformed	1
Of	1
nuptial	1
sanctity,	1
and	1
marriage	1
rites:	1
Grace	1
was	1
in	1
all	1
her	1
steps,	1
Heaven	1
in	1
her	1
eye,	1
In	1
every	1
gesture	1
dignity	1
and	1
love.	1
I,	1
overjoyed,	1
could	1
not	1
forbear	1
aloud.	1
This	1
turn	1
hath	1
made	1
amends;	1
thou	1
hast	1
fulfilled	1
Thy	1
words,	1
Creator	1
bounteous	1
and	1
benign,	1
Giver	1
of	1
all	1
things	1
fair!	1
but	1
fairest	1
this	1
Of	1
all	1
thy	1
gifts!	1
nor	1
enviest.	1
I	1
now	1
see	1
Bone	1
of	1
my	1
bone,	1
flesh	1
of	1
my	1
flesh,	1
myself	1
Before	1
me:	1
Woman	1
is	1
her	1
name;of	1
Man	1
Extracted:	1
for	1
this	1
cause	1
he	1
shall	1
forego	1
Father	1
and	1
mother,	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
adhere;	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
one	1
flesh,	1
one	1
heart,	1
one	1
soul.	1
She	1
heard	1
me	1
thus;	1
and	1
though	1
divinely	1
brought,	1
Yet	1
innocence,	1
and	1
virgin	1
modesty,	1
Her	1
virtue,	1
and	1
the	1
conscience	1
of	1
her	1
worth,	1
That	1
would	1
be	1
wooed,	1
and	1
not	1
unsought	1
be	1
won,	1
Not	1
obvious,	1
not	1
obtrusive,	1
but,	1
retired,	1
The	1
more	1
desirable;	1
or,	1
to	1
say	1
all,	1
Nature	1
herself,	1
though	1
pure	1
of	1
sinful	1
thought,	1
Wrought	1
in	1
her	1
so,	1
that,	1
seeing	1
me,	1
she	1
turned:	1
I	1
followed	1
her;	1
she	1
what	1
was	1
honour	1
knew,	1
And	1
with	1
obsequious	1
majesty	1
approved	1
My	1
pleaded	1
reason.	1
To	1
the	1
nuptial	1
bower	1
I	1
led	1
her	1
blushing	1
like	1
the	1
morn:	1
All	1
Heaven,	1
And	1
happy	1
constellations,	1
on	1
that	1
hour	1
Shed	1
their	1
selectest	1
influence;	1
the	1
Earth	1
Gave	1
sign	1
of	1
gratulation,	1
and	1
each	1
hill;	1
Joyous	1
the	1
birds;	1
fresh	1
gales	1
and	1
gentle	1
airs	1
Whispered	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
woods,	1
and	1
from	1
their	1
wings	1
Flung	1
rose,	1
flung	1
odours	1
from	1
the	1
spicy	1
shrub,	1
Disporting,	1
till	1
the	1
amorous	1
bird	1
of	1
night	1
Sung	1
spousal,	1
and	1
bid	1
haste	1
the	1
evening-star	1
On	1
his	1
hill	1
top,	1
to	1
light	1
the	1
bridal	1
lamp.	1
Thus	1
have	1
I	1
told	1
thee	1
all	1
my	1
state,	1
and	1
brought	1
My	1
story	1
to	1
the	1
sum	1
of	1
earthly	1
bliss,	1
Which	1
I	1
enjoy;	1
and	1
must	1
confess	1
to	1
find	1
In	1
all	1
things	1
else	1
delight	1
indeed,	1
but	1
such	1
As,	1
used	1
or	1
not,	1
works	1
in	1
the	1
mind	1
no	1
change,	1
Nor	1
vehement	1
desire;	1
these	1
delicacies	1
I	1
mean	1
of	1
taste,	1
sight,	1
smell,	1
herbs,	1
fruits,	1
and	1
flowers,	1
Walks,	1
and	1
the	1
melody	1
of	1
birds:	1
but	1
here	1
Far	1
otherwise,	1
transported	1
I	1
behold,	1
Transported	1
touch;	1
here	1
passion	1
first	1
I	1
felt,	1
Commotion	1
strange!	1
in	1
all	1
enjoyments	1
else	1
Superiour	1
and	1
unmoved;	1
here	1
only	1
weak	1
Against	1
the	1
charm	1
of	1
Beauty's	1
powerful	1
glance.	1
Or	1
Nature	1
failed	1
in	1
me,	1
and	1
left	1
some	1
part	1
Not	1
proof	1
enough	1
such	1
object	1
to	1
sustain;	1
Or,	1
from	1
my	1
side	1
subducting,	1
took	1
perhaps	1
More	1
than	1
enough;	1
at	1
least	1
on	1
her	1
bestowed	1
Too	1
much	1
of	1
ornament,	1
in	1
outward	1
show	1
Elaborate,	1
of	1
inward	1
less	1
exact.	1
For	1
well	1
I	1
understand	1
in	1
the	1
prime	1
end	1
Of	1
Nature	1
her	1
the	1
inferiour,	1
in	1
the	1
mind	1
And	1
inward	1
faculties,	1
which	1
most	1
excel;	1
In	1
outward	1
also	1
her	1
resembling	1
less	1
His	1
image	1
who	1
made	1
both,	1
and	1
less	1
expressing	1
The	1
character	1
of	1
that	1
dominion	1
given	1
O'er	1
other	1
creatures:	1
Yet	1
when	1
I	1
approach	1
Her	1
loveliness,	1
so	1
absolute	1
she	1
seems	1
And	1
in	1
herself	1
complete,	1
so	1
well	1
to	1
know	1
Her	1
own,	1
that	1
what	1
she	1
wills	1
to	1
do	1
or	1
say,	1
Seems	1
wisest,	1
virtuousest,	1
discreetest,	1
best:	1
All	1
higher	1
knowledge	1
in	1
her	1
presence	1
falls	1
Degraded;	1
Wisdom	1
in	1
discourse	1
with	1
her	1
Loses	1
discountenanced,	1
and	1
like	1
Folly	1
shows;	1
Authority	1
and	1
Reason	1
on	1
her	1
wait,	1
As	1
one	1
intended	1
first,	1
not	1
after	1
made	1
Occasionally;	1
and,	1
to	1
consummate	1
all,	1
Greatness	1
of	1
mind	1
and	1
Nobleness	1
their	1
seat	1
Build	1
in	1
her	1
loveliest,	1
and	1
create	1
an	1
awe	1
About	1
her,	1
as	1
a	1
guard	1
angelick	1
placed.	1
To	1
whom	1
the	1
Angel	1
with	1
contracted	1
brow.	1
Accuse	1
not	1
Nature,	1
she	1
hath	1
done	1
her	1
part;	1
Do	1
thou	1
but	1
thine;	1
and	1
be	1
not	1
diffident	1
Of	1
Wisdom;	1
she	1
deserts	1
thee	1
not,	1
if	1
thou	1
Dismiss	1
not	1
her,	1
when	1
most	1
thou	1
needest	1
her	1
nigh,	1
By	1
attributing	1
overmuch	1
to	1
things	1
Less	1
excellent,	1
as	1
thou	1
thyself	1
perceivest.	1
For,	1
what	1
admirest	1
thou,	1
what	1
transports	1
thee	1
so,	1
An	1
outside?	1
fair,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
and	1
worthy	1
well	1
Thy	1
cherishing,	1
thy	1
honouring,	1
and	1
thy	1
love;	1
Not	1
thy	1
subjection:	1
Weigh	1
with	1
her	1
thyself;	1
Then	1
value:	1
Oft-times	1
nothing	1
profits	1
more	1
Than	1
self-esteem,	1
grounded	1
on	1
just	1
and	1
right	1
Well	1
managed;	1
of	1
that	1
skill	1
the	1
more	1
thou	1
knowest,	1
The	1
more	1
she	1
will	1
acknowledge	1
thee	1
her	1
head,	1
And	1
to	1
realities	1
yield	1
all	1
her	1
shows:	1
Made	1
so	1
adorn	1
for	1
thy	1
delight	1
the	1
more,	1
So	1
awful,	1
that	1
with	1
honour	1
thou	1
mayest	1
love	1
Thy	1
mate,	1
who	1
sees	1
when	1
thou	1
art	1
seen	1
least	1
wise.	1
But	1
if	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
touch,	1
whereby	1
mankind	1
Is	1
propagated,	1
seem	1
such	1
dear	1
delight	1
Beyond	1
all	1
other;	1
think	1
the	1
same	1
vouchsafed	1
To	1
cattle	1
and	1
each	1
beast;	1
which	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
To	1
them	1
made	1
common	1
and	1
divulged,	1
if	1
aught	1
Therein	1
enjoyed	1
were	1
worthy	1
to	1
subdue	1
The	1
soul	1
of	1
man,	1
or	1
passion	1
in	1
him	1
move.	1
What	1
higher	1
in	1
her	1
society	1
thou	1
findest	1
Attractive,	1
human,	1
rational,	1
love	1
still;	1
In	1
loving	1
thou	1
dost	1
well,	1
in	1
passion	1
not,	1
Wherein	1
true	1
love	1
consists	1
not:	1
Love	1
refines	1
The	1
thoughts,	1
and	1
heart	1
enlarges;	1
hath	1
his	1
seat	1
In	1
reason,	1
and	1
is	1
judicious;	1
is	1
the	1
scale	1
By	1
which	1
to	1
heavenly	1
love	1
thou	1
mayest	1
ascend,	1
Not	1
sunk	1
in	1
carnal	1
pleasure;	1
for	1
which	1
cause,	1
Among	1
the	1
beasts	1
no	1
mate	1
for	1
thee	1
was	1
found.	1
To	1
whom	1
thus,	1
half	1
abashed,	1
Adam	1
replied.	1
Neither	1
her	1
outside	1
formed	1
so	1
fair,	1
nor	1
aught	1
In	1
procreation	1
common	1
to	1
all	1
kinds,	1
(Though	1
higher	1
of	1
the	1
genial	1
bed	1
by	1
far,	1
And	1
with	1
mysterious	1
reverence	1
I	1
deem,)	1
So	1
much	1
delights	1
me,	1
as	1
those	1
graceful	1
acts,	1
Those	1
thousand	1
decencies,	1
that	1
daily	1
flow	1
From	1
all	1
her	1
words	1
and	1
actions	1
mixed	1
with	1
love	1
And	1
sweet	1
compliance,	1
which	1
declare	1
unfeigned	1
Union	1
of	1
mind,	1
or	1
in	1
us	1
both	1
one	1
soul;	1
Harmony	1
to	1
behold	1
in	1
wedded	1
pair	1
More	1
grateful	1
than	1
harmonious	1
sound	1
to	1
the	1
ear.	1
Yet	1
these	1
subject	1
not;	1
I	1
to	1
thee	1
disclose	1
What	1
inward	1
thence	1
I	1
feel,	1
not	1
therefore	1
foiled,	1
Who	1
meet	1
with	1
various	1
objects,	1
from	1
the	1
sense	1
Variously	1
representing;	1
yet,	1
still	1
free,	1
Approve	1
the	1
best,	1
and	1
follow	1
what	1
I	1
approve.	1
To	1
love,	1
thou	1
blamest	1
me	1
not;	1
for	1
Love,	1
thou	1
sayest,	1
Leads	1
up	1
to	1
Heaven,	1
is	1
both	1
the	1
way	1
and	1
guide;	1
Bear	1
with	1
me	1
then,	1
if	1
lawful	1
what	1
I	1
ask:	1
Love	1
not	1
the	1
heavenly	1
Spirits,	1
and	1
how	1
their	1
love	1
Express	1
they?	1
by	1
looks	1
only?	1
or	1
do	1
they	1
mix	1
Irradiance,	1
virtual	1
or	1
immediate	1
touch?	1
To	1
whom	1
the	1
Angel,	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
that	1
glowed	1
Celestial	1
rosy	1
red,	1
Love's	1
proper	1
hue,	1
Answered.	1
Let	1
it	1
suffice	1
thee	1
that	1
thou	1
knowest	1
Us	1
happy,	1
and	1
without	1
love	1
no	1
happiness.	1
Whatever	1
pure	1
thou	1
in	1
the	1
body	1
enjoyest,	1
(And	1
pure	1
thou	1
wert	1
created)	1
we	1
enjoy	1
In	1
eminence;	1
and	1
obstacle	1
find	1
none	1
Of	1
membrane,	1
joint,	1
or	1
limb,	1
exclusive	1
bars;	1
Easier	1
than	1
air	1
with	1
air,	1
if	1
Spirits	1
embrace,	1
Total	1
they	1
mix,	1
union	1
of	1
pure	1
with	1
pure	1
Desiring,	1
nor	1
restrained	1
conveyance	1
need,	1
As	1
flesh	1
to	1
mix	1
with	1
flesh,	1
or	1
soul	1
with	1
soul.	1
But	1
I	1
can	1
now	1
no	1
more;	1
the	1
parting	1
sun	1
Beyond	1
the	1
Earth's	1
green	1
Cape	1
and	1
verdant	1
Isles	1
Hesperian	1
sets,	1
my	1
signal	1
to	1
depart.	1
Be	1
strong,	1
live	1
happy,	1
and	1
love!	1
But,	1
first	1
of	1
all,	1
Him,	1
whom	1
to	1
love	1
is	1
to	1
obey,	1
and	1
keep	1
His	1
great	1
command;	1
take	1
heed	1
lest	1
passion	1
sway	1
Thy	1
judgement	1
to	1
do	1
aught,	1
which	1
else	1
free	1
will	1
Would	1
not	1
admit:	1
thine,	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
thy	1
sons,	1
The	1
weal	1
or	1
woe	1
in	1
thee	1
is	1
placed;	1
beware!	1
I	1
in	1
thy	1
persevering	1
shall	1
rejoice,	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
Blest:	1
Stand	1
fast;to	1
stand	1
or	1
fall	1
Free	1
in	1
thine	1
own	1
arbitrement	1
it	1
lies.	1
Perfect	1
within,	1
no	1
outward	1
aid	1
require;	1
And	1
all	1
temptation	1
to	1
transgress	1
repel.	1
So	1
saying,	1
he	1
arose;	1
whom	1
Adam	1
thus	1
Followed	1
with	1
benediction.	1
Since	1
to	1
part,	1
Go,	1
heavenly	1

ethereal	1
Messenger,	1
Sent	1
from	1
whose	1
sovran	1
goodness	1
I	1
adore!	1
Gentle	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
affable	1
hath	1
been	1
Thy	1
condescension,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
honoured	1
ever	1
With	1
grateful	1
memory:	1
Thou	1
to	1
mankind	1
Be	1
good	1
and	1
friendly	1
still,	1
and	1
oft	1
return!	1
So	1
parted	1
they;	1
the	1
Angel	1
up	1
to	1
Heaven	1
From	1
the	1
thick	1
shade,	1
and	1
Adam	1
to	1

He	1
circled;	1
four	1
times	1
crossed	1
the	1
car	1
of	1
night	1
From	1
pole	1
to	1
pole,	1
traversing	1
each	1
colure;	1
On	1
the	1
eighth	1
returned;	1
and,	1
on	1
the	1
coast	1
averse	1
From	1
entrance	1
or	1
Cherubick	1
watch,	1
by	1
stealth	1
Found	1
unsuspected	1
way.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
place,	1
Now	1
not,	1
though	1
sin,	1
not	1
time,	1
first	1
wrought	1
the	1
change,	1
Where	1
Tigris,	1
at	1
the	1
foot	1
of	1
Paradise,	1
Into	1
a	1
gulf	1
shot	1
under	1
ground,	1
till	1
part	1
Rose	1
up	1
a	1
fountain	1
by	1
the	1
tree	1
of	1
life:	1
In	1
with	1
the	1
river	1
sunk,	1
and	1
with	1
it	1
rose	1
Satan,	1
involved	1
in	1
rising	1
mist;	1
then	1
sought	1
Where	1
to	1
lie	1
hid;	1
sea	1
he	1
had	1
searched,	1
and	1
land,	1
From	1
Eden	1
over	1
Pontus	1
and	1
the	1
pool	1
Maeotis,	1
up	1
beyond	1
the	1
river	1
Ob;	1
Downward	1
as	1
far	1
antarctick;	1
and	1
in	1
length,	1
West	1
from	1
Orontes	1
to	1
the	1
ocean	1
barred	1
At	1
Darien	1
;	1
thence	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
where	1
flows	1
Ganges	1
and	1
Indus:	1
Thus	1
the	1
orb	1
he	1
roamed	1
With	1
narrow	1
search;	1
and	1
with	1
inspection	1
deep	1
Considered	1
every	1
creature,	1
which	1
of	1
all	1
Most	1
opportune	1
might	1
serve	1
his	1
wiles;	1
and	1
found	1
The	1
Serpent	1
subtlest	1
beast	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
field.	1
Him	1
after	1
long	1
debate,	1
irresolute	1
Of	1
thoughts	1
revolved,	1
his	1
final	1
sentence	1
chose	1
Fit	1
vessel,	1
fittest	1
imp	1
of	1
fraud,	1
in	1
whom	1
To	1
enter,	1
and	1
his	1
dark	1
suggestions	1
hide	1
From	1
sharpest	1
sight:	1
for,	1
in	1
the	1
wily	1
snake	1
Whatever	1
sleights,	1
none	1
would	1
suspicious	1
mark,	1
As	1
from	1
his	1
wit	1
and	1
native	1
subtlety	1
Proceeding;	1
which,	1
in	1
other	1
beasts	1
observed,	1
Doubt	1
might	1
beget	1
of	1
diabolick	1
power	1
Active	1
within,	1
beyond	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
brute.	1
Thus	1
he	1
resolved,	1
but	1
first	1
from	1
inward	1
grief	1
His	1
bursting	1
passion	1
into	1
plaints	1
thus	1
poured.	1
More	1
justly,	1
seat	1
worthier	1
of	1
Gods,	1
as	1
built	1
With	1
second	1
thoughts,	1
reforming	1
what	1
was	1
old!	1
O	1
Earth,	1
how	1
like	1
to	1
Heaven,	1
if	1
not	1
preferred	1
For	1
what	1
God,	1
after	1
better,	1
worse	1
would	1
build?	1
Terrestrial	1
Heaven,	1
danced	1
round	1
by	1
other	1
Heavens	1
That	1
shine,	1
yet	1
bear	1
their	1
bright	1
officious	1
lamps,	1
Light	1
above	1
light,	1
for	1
thee	1
alone,	1
as	1
seems,	1
In	1
thee	1
concentring	1
all	1
their	1
precious	1
beams	1
Of	1
sacred	1
influence!	1
As	1
God	1
in	1
Heaven	1
Is	1
center,	1
yet	1
extends	1
to	1
all;	1
so	1
thou,	1
Centring,	1
receivest	1
from	1
all	1
those	1
orbs:	1
in	1
thee,	1
Not	1
in	1
themselves,	1
all	1
their	1
known	1
virtue	1
appears	1
Productive	1
in	1
herb,	1
plant,	1
and	1
nobler	1
birth	1
Of	1
creatures	1
animate	1
with	1
gradual	1
life	1
Of	1
growth,	1
sense,	1
reason,	1
all	1
summed	1
up	1
in	1
Man.	1
With	1
what	1
delight	1
could	1
I	1
have	1
walked	1
thee	1
round,	1
If	1
I	1
could	1
joy	1
in	1
aught,	1
sweet	1
interchange	1
Of	1
hill,	1
and	1
valley,	1
rivers,	1
woods,	1
and	1
plains,	1
Now	1
land,	1
now	1
sea	1
and	1
shores	1
with	1
forest	1
crowned,	1
Rocks,	1
dens,	1
and	1
caves!	1
But	1
I	1
in	1
none	1
of	1
these	1
Find	1
place	1
or	1
refuge;	1
and	1
the	1
more	1
I	1
see	1
Pleasures	1
about	1
me,	1
so	1
much	1
more	1
I	1
feel	1
Torment	1
within	1
me,	1
as	1
from	1
the	1
hateful	1
siege	1
Of	1
contraries:	1
all	1
good	1
to	1
me	1
becomes	1
Bane,	1
and	1
in	1
Heaven	1
much	1
worse	1
would	1
be	1
my	1
state.	1
But	1
neither	1
here	1
seek	1
I,	1
no	1
nor	1
in	1
Heaven	1
To	1
dwell,	1
unless	1
by	1
mastering	1
Heaven's	1
Supreme;	1
Nor	1
hope	1
to	1
be	1
myself	1
less	1
miserable	1
By	1
what	1
I	1
seek,	1
but	1
others	1
to	1
make	1
such	1
As	1
I,	1
though	1
thereby	1
worse	1
to	1
me	1
redound:	1
For	1
only	1
in	1
destroying	1
I	1
find	1
ease	1
To	1
my	1
relentless	1
thoughts;	1
and,	1
him	1
destroyed,	1
Or	1
won	1
to	1
what	1
may	1
work	1
his	1
utter	1
loss,	1
For	1
whom	1
all	1
this	1
was	1
made,	1
all	1
this	1
will	1
soon	1
Follow,	1
as	1
to	1
him	1
linked	1
in	1
weal	1
or	1
woe;	1
In	1
woe	1
then;	1
that	1
destruction	1
wide	1
may	1
range:	1
To	1
me	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
glory	1
sole	1
among	1
The	1
infernal	1
Powers,	1
in	1
one	1
day	1
to	1
have	1
marred	1
What	1
he,	1
Almighty	1
styled,	1
six	1
nights	1
and	1
days	1
Continued	1
making;	1
and	1
who	1
knows	1
how	1
long	1
Before	1
had	1
been	1
contriving?	1
though	1
perhaps	1
Not	1
longer	1
than	1
since	1
I,	1
in	1
one	1
night,	1
freed	1
From	1
servitude	1
inglorious	1
well	1
nigh	1
half	1
The	1
angelick	1
name,	1
and	1
thinner	1
left	1
the	1
throng	1
Of	1
his	1
adorers:	1
He,	1
to	1
be	1
avenged,	1
And	1
to	1
repair	1
his	1
numbers	1
thus	1
impaired,	1
Whether	1
such	1
virtue	1
spent	1
of	1
old	1
now	1
failed	1
More	1
Angels	1
to	1
create,	1
if	1
they	1
at	1
least	1
Are	1
his	1
created,	1
or,	1
to	1
spite	1
us	1
more,	1
Determined	1
to	1
advance	1
into	1
our	1
room	1
A	1
creature	1
formed	1
of	1
earth,	1
and	1
him	1
endow,	1
Exalted	1
from	1
so	1
base	1
original,	1
With	1
heavenly	1
spoils,	1
our	1
spoils:	1
What	1
he	1
decreed,	1
He	1
effected;	1
Man	1
he	1
made,	1
and	1
for	1
him	1
built	1
Magnificent	1
this	1
world,	1
and	1
earth	1
his	1
seat,	1
Him	1
lord	1
pronounced;	1
and,	1
O	1
indignity!	1
Subjected	1
to	1
his	1
service	1
angel-wings,	1
And	1
flaming	1
ministers	1
to	1
watch	1
and	1
tend	1
Their	1
earthly	1
charge:	1
Of	1
these	1
the	1
vigilance	1
I	1
dread;	1
and,	1
to	1
elude,	1
thus	1
wrapt	1
in	1
mist	1
Of	1
midnight	1
vapour	1
glide	1
obscure,	1
and	1
pry	1
In	1
every	1
bush	1
and	1
brake,	1
where	1
hap	1
may	1
find	1
The	1
serpent	1
sleeping;	1
in	1
whose	1
mazy	1
folds	1
To	1
hide	1
me,	1
and	1
the	1
dark	1
intent	1
I	1
bring.	1
O	1
foul	1
descent!	1
that	1
I,	1
who	1
erst	1
contended	1
With	1
Gods	1
to	1
sit	1
the	1
highest,	1
am	1
now	1
constrained	1
Into	1
a	1
beast;	1
and,	1
mixed	1
with	1
bestial	1
slime,	1
This	1
essence	1
to	1
incarnate	1
and	1
imbrute,	1
That	1
to	1
the	1
highth	1
of	1
Deity	1
aspired!	1
But	1
what	1
will	1
not	1
ambition	1
and	1
revenge	1
Descend	1
to?	1
Who	1
aspires,	1
must	1
down	1
as	1
low	1
As	1
high	1
he	1
soared;	1
obnoxious,	1
first	1
or	1
last,	1
To	1
basest	1
things.	1
Revenge,	1
at	1
first	1
though	1
sweet,	1
Bitter	1
ere	1
long,	1
back	1
on	1
itself	1
recoils:	1
Let	1
it;	1
I	1
reck	1
not,	1
so	1
it	1
light	1
well	1
aimed,	1
Since	1
higher	1
I	1
fall	1
short,	1
on	1
him	1
who	1
next	1
Provokes	1
my	1
envy,	1
this	1
new	1
favourite	1
Of	1
Heaven,	1
this	1
man	1
of	1
clay,	1
son	1
of	1
despite,	1
Whom,	1
us	1
the	1
more	1
to	1
spite,	1
his	1
Maker	1
raised	1
From	1
dust:	1
Spite	1
then	1
with	1
spite	1
is	1
best	1
repaid.	1
So	1
saying,	1
through	1
each	1
thicket	1
dank	1
or	1
dry,	1
Like	1
a	1
black	1
mist	1
low-creeping,	1
he	1
held	1
on	1
His	1
midnight-search,	1
where	1
soonest	1
he	1
might	1
find	1
The	1
serpent;	1
him	1
fast-sleeping	1
soon	1
he	1
found	1
In	1
labyrinth	1
of	1
many	1
a	1
round	1
self-rolled,	1
His	1
head	1
the	1
midst,	1
well	1
stored	1
with	1
subtile	1
wiles:	1
Not	1
yet	1
in	1
horrid	1
shade	1
or	1
dismal	1
den,	1
Nor	1
nocent	1
yet;	1
but,	1
on	1
the	1
grassy	1
herb,	1
Fearless	1
unfeared	1
he	1
slept:	1
in	1
at	1
his	1
mouth	1
The	1
Devil	1
entered;	1
and	1
his	1
brutal	1
sense,	1
In	1
heart	1
or	1
head,	1
possessing,	1
soon	1
inspired	1
With	1
act	1
intelligential;	1
but	1
his	1
sleep	1
Disturbed	1
not,	1
waiting	1
close	1
the	1
approach	1
of	1
morn.	1
Now,	1
when	1
as	1
sacred	1
light	1
began	1
to	1
dawn	1
In	1
Eden	1
on	1
the	1
humid	1
flowers,	1
that	1
breathed	1
Their	1
morning	1
incense,	1
when	1
all	1
things,	1
that	1
breathe,	1
From	1
the	1
Earth's	1
great	1
altar	1
send	1
up	1
silent	1
praise	1
To	1
the	1
Creator,	1
and	1
his	1
nostrils	1
fill	1
With	1
grateful	1
smell,	1
forth	1
came	1
the	1
human	1
pair,	1
And	1
joined	1
their	1
vocal	1
worship	1
to	1
the	1
quire	1
Of	1
creatures	1
wanting	1
voice;	1
that	1
done,	1
partake	1
The	1
season	1
prime	1
for	1
sweetest	1
scents	1
and	1
airs:	1
Then	1
commune,	1
how	1
that	1
day	1
they	1
best	1
may	1
ply	1
Their	1
growing	1
work:	1
for	1
much	1
their	1
work	1
out-grew	1
The	1
hands'	1
dispatch	1
of	1
two	1
gardening	1
so	1
wide,	1
And	1
Eve	1
first	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
thus	1
began.	1
Adam,	1
well	1
may	1
we	1
labour	1
still	1
to	1
dress	1
This	1
garden,	1
still	1
to	1
tend	1
plant,	1
herb,	1
and	1
flower,	1
Our	1
pleasant	1
task	1
enjoined;	1
but,	1
till	1
more	1
hands	1
Aid	1
us,	1
the	1
work	1
under	1
our	1
labour	1
grows,	1
Luxurious	1
by	1
restraint;	1
what	1
we	1
by	1
day	1
Lop	1
overgrown,	1
or	1
prune,	1
or	1
prop,	1
or	1
bind,	1
One	1
night	1
or	1
two	1
with	1
wanton	1
growth	1
derides	1
Tending	1
to	1
wild.	1
Thou	1
therefore	1
now	1
advise,	1
Or	1
bear	1
what	1
to	1
my	1
mind	1
first	1
thoughts	1
present:	1
Let	1
us	1
divide	1
our	1
labours;	1
thou,	1
where	1
choice	1
Leads	1
thee,	1
or	1
where	1
most	1
needs,	1
whether	1
to	1
wind	1
The	1
woodbine	1
round	1
this	1
arbour,	1
or	1
direct	1
The	1
clasping	1
ivy	1
where	1
to	1
climb;	1
while	1
I,	1
In	1
yonder	1
spring	1
of	1
roses	1
intermixed	1
With	1
myrtle,	1
find	1
what	1
to	1
redress	1
till	1
noon:	1
For,	1
while	1
so	1
near	1
each	1
other	1
thus	1
all	1
day	1
Our	1
task	1
we	1
choose,	1
what	1
wonder	1
if	1
so	1
near	1
Looks	1
intervene	1
and	1
smiles,	1
or	1
object	1
new	1
Casual	1
discourse	1
draw	1
on;	1
which	1
intermits	1
Our	1
day's	1
work,	1
brought	1
to	1
little,	1
though	1
begun	1
Early,	1
and	1
the	1
hour	1
of	1
supper	1
comes	1
unearned?	1
To	1
whom	1
mild	1
answer	1
Adam	1
thus	1
returned.	1
Sole	1
Eve,	1
associate	1
sole,	1
to	1
me	1
beyond	1
Compare	1
above	1
all	1
living	1
creatures	1
dear!	1
Well	1
hast	1
thou	1
motioned,	1
well	1
thy	1
thoughts	1
employed,	1
How	1
we	1
might	1
best	1
fulfil	1
the	1
work	1
which	1
here	1
God	1
hath	1
assigned	1
us;	1
nor	1
of	1
me	1
shalt	1
pass	1
Unpraised:	1
for	1
nothing	1
lovelier	1
can	1
be	1
found	1
In	1
woman,	1
than	1
to	1
study	1
houshold	1
good,	1
And	1
good	1
works	1
in	1
her	1
husband	1
to	1
promote.	1
Yet	1
not	1
so	1
strictly	1
hath	1
our	1
Lord	1
imposed	1
Labour,	1
as	1
to	1
debar	1
us	1
when	1
we	1
need	1
Refreshment,	1
whether	1
food,	1
or	1
talk	1
between,	1
Food	1
of	1
the	1
mind,	1
or	1
this	1
sweet	1
intercourse	1
Of	1
looks	1
and	1
smiles;	1
for	1
smiles	1
from	1
reason	1
flow,	1
To	1
brute	1
denied,	1
and	1
are	1
of	1
love	1
the	1
food;	1
Love,	1
not	1
the	1
lowest	1
end	1
of	1
human	1
life.	1
For	1
not	1
to	1
irksome	1
toil,	1
but	1
to	1
delight,	1
He	1
made	1
us,	1
and	1
delight	1
to	1
reason	1
joined.	1
These	1
paths	1
and	1
bowers	1
doubt	1
not	1
but	1
our	1
joint	1
hands	1
Will	1
keep	1
from	1
wilderness	1
with	1
ease,	1
as	1
wide	1
As	1
we	1
need	1
walk,	1
till	1
younger	1
hands	1
ere	1
long	1
Assist	1
us;	1
But,	1
if	1
much	1
converse	1
perhaps	1
Thee	1
satiate,	1
to	1
short	1
absence	1
I	1
could	1
yield:	1
For	1
solitude	1
sometimes	1
is	1
best	1
society,	1
And	1
short	1
retirement	1
urges	1
sweet	1
return.	1
But	1
other	1
doubt	1
possesses	1
me,	1
lest	1
harm	1
Befall	1
thee	1
severed	1
from	1
me;	1
for	1
thou	1
knowest	1
What	1
hath	1
been	1
warned	1
us,	1
what	1
malicious	1
foe	1
Envying	1
our	1
happiness,	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
Despairing,	1
seeks	1
to	1
work	1
us	1
woe	1
and	1
shame	1
By	1
sly	1
assault;	1
and	1
somewhere	1
nigh	1
at	1
hand	1
Watches,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
with	1
greedy	1
hope	1
to	1
find	1
His	1
wish	1
and	1
best	1
advantage,	1
us	1
asunder;	1
Hopeless	1
to	1
circumvent	1
us	1
joined,	1
where	1
each	1
To	1
other	1
speedy	1
aid	1
might	1
lend	1
at	1
need:	1
Whether	1
his	1
first	1
design	1
be	1
to	1
withdraw	1
Our	1
fealty	1
from	1
God,	1
or	1
to	1
disturb	1
Conjugal	1
love,	1
than	1
which	1
perhaps	1
no	1
bliss	1
Enjoyed	1
by	1
us	1
excites	1
his	1
envy	1
more;	1
Or	1
this,	1
or	1
worse,	1
leave	1
not	1
the	1
faithful	1
side	1
That	1
gave	1
thee	1
being,	1
still	1
shades	1
thee,	1
and	1
protects.	1
The	1
wife,	1
where	1
danger	1
or	1
dishonour	1
lurks,	1
Safest	1
and	1
seemliest	1
by	1
her	1
husband	1
stays,	1
Who	1
guards	1
her,	1
or	1
with	1
her	1
the	1
worst	1
endures.	1
To	1
whom	1
the	1
virgin	1
majesty	1
of	1
Eve,	1
As	1
one	1
who	1
loves,	1
and	1
some	1
unkindness	1
meets,	1
With	1
sweet	1
austere	1
composure	1
thus	1
replied.	1
Offspring	1
of	1
Heaven	1
and	1
Earth,	1
and	1
all	1
Earth's	1
Lord!	1
That	1
such	1
an	1
enemy	1
we	1
have,	1
who	1
seeks	1
Our	1
ruin,	1
both	1
by	1
thee	1
informed	1
I	1
learn,	1
And	1
from	1
the	1
parting	1
Angel	1
over-heard,	1
As	1
in	1
a	1
shady	1
nook	1
I	1
stood	1
behind,	1
Just	1
then	1
returned	1
at	1
shut	1
of	1
evening	1
flowers.	1
But,	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldst	1
my	1
firmness	1
therefore	1
doubt	1
To	1
God	1
or	1
thee,	1
because	1
we	1
have	1
a	1
foe	1
May	1
tempt	1
it,	1
I	1
expected	1
not	1
to	1
hear.	1
His	1
violence	1
thou	1
fearest	1
not,	1
being	1
such	1
As	1
we,	1
not	1
capable	1
of	1
death	1
or	1
pain,	1
Can	1
either	1
not	1
receive,	1
or	1
can	1
repel.	1
His	1
fraud	1
is	1
then	1
thy	1
fear;	1
which	1
plain	1
infers	1
Thy	1
equal	1
fear,	1
that	1
my	1
firm	1
faith	1
and	1
love	1
Can	1
by	1
his	1
fraud	1
be	1
shaken	1
or	1
seduced;	1
Thoughts,	1
which	1
how	1
found	1
they	1
harbour	1
in	1
thy	1
breast,	1
Adam,	1
mis-thought	1
of	1
her	1
to	1
thee	1
so	1
dear?	1
To	1
whom	1
with	1
healing	1
words	1
Adam	1
replied.	1
Daughter	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
Man,	1
immortal	1
Eve!	1
For	1
such	1
thou	1
art;	1
from	1
sin	1
and	1
blame	1
entire:	1
Not	1
diffident	1
of	1
thee	1
do	1
I	1
dissuade	1
Thy	1
absence	1
from	1
my	1
sight,	1
but	1
to	1
avoid	1
The	1
attempt	1
itself,	1
intended	1
by	1
our	1
foe.	1
For	1
he	1
who	1
tempts,	1
though	1
in	1
vain,	1
at	1
least	1
asperses	1
The	1
tempted	1
with	1
dishonour	1
foul;	1
supposed	1
Not	1
incorruptible	1
of	1
faith,	1
not	1
proof	1
Against	1
temptation:	1
Thou	1
thyself	1
with	1
scorn	1
And	1
anger	1
wouldst	1
resent	1
the	1
offered	1
wrong,	1
Though	1
ineffectual	1
found:	1
misdeem	1
not	1
then,	1
If	1
such	1
affront	1
I	1
labour	1
to	1
avert	1
From	1
thee	1
alone,	1
which	1
on	1
us	1
both	1
at	1
once	1
The	1
enemy,	1
though	1
bold,	1
will	1
hardly	1
dare;	1
Or	1
daring,	1
first	1
on	1
me	1
the	1
assault	1
shall	1
light.	1
Nor	1
thou	1
his	1
malice	1
and	1
false	1
guile	1
contemn;	1
Subtle	1
he	1
needs	1
must	1
be,	1
who	1
could	1
seduce	1
Angels;	1
nor	1
think	1
superfluous	1
other's	1
aid.	1
I,	1
from	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
thy	1
looks,	1
receive	1
Access	1
in	1
every	1
virtue;	1
in	1
thy	1
sight	1
More	1
wise,	1
more	1
watchful,	1
stronger,	1
if	1
need	1
were	1
Of	1
outward	1
strength;	1
while	1
shame,	1
thou	1
looking	1
on,	1
Shame	1
to	1
be	1
overcome	1
or	1
over-reached,	1
Would	1
utmost	1
vigour	1
raise,	1
and	1
raised	1
unite.	1
Why	1
shouldst	1
not	1
thou	1
like	1
sense	1
within	1
thee	1
feel	1
When	1
I	1
am	1
present,	1
and	1
thy	1
trial	1
choose	1
With	1
me,	1
best	1
witness	1
of	1
thy	1
virtue	1
tried?	1
So	1
spake	1
domestick	1
Adam	1
in	1
his	1
care	1
And	1
matrimonial	1
love;	1
but	1
Eve,	1
who	1
thought	1
Less	1
attributed	1
to	1
her	1
faith	1
sincere,	1
Thus	1
her	1
reply	1
with	1
accent	1
sweet	1
renewed.	1
If	1
this	1
be	1
our	1
condition,	1
thus	1
to	1
dwell	1
In	1
narrow	1
circuit	1
straitened	1
by	1
a	1
foe,	1
Subtle	1
or	1
violent,	1
we	1
not	1
endued	1
Single	1
with	1
like	1
defence,	1
wherever	1
met;	1
How	1
are	1
we	1
happy,	1
still	1
in	1
fear	1
of	1
harm?	1
But	1
harm	1
precedes	1
not	1
sin:	1
only	1
our	1
foe,	1
Tempting,	1
affronts	1
us	1
with	1
his	1
foul	1
esteem	1
Of	1
our	1
integrity:	1
his	1
foul	1
esteem	1
Sticks	1
no	1
dishonour	1
on	1
our	1
front,	1
but	1
turns	1
Foul	1
on	1
himself;	1
then	1
wherefore	1
shunned	1
or	1
feared	1
By	1
us?	1
who	1
rather	1
double	1
honour	1
gain	1
From	1
his	1
surmise	1
proved	1
false;	1
find	1
peace	1
within,	1
Favour	1
from	1
Heaven,	1
our	1
witness,	1
from	1
the	1
event.	1
And	1
what	1
is	1
faith,	1
love,	1
virtue,	1
unassayed	1
Alone,	1
without	1
exteriour	1
help	1
sustained?	1
Let	1
us	1
not	1
then	1
suspect	1
our	1
happy	1
state	1
Left	1
so	1
imperfect	1
by	1
the	1
Maker	1
wise,	1
As	1
not	1
secure	1
to	1
single	1
or	1
combined.	1
Frail	1
is	1
our	1
happiness,	1
if	1
this	1
be	1
so,	1
And	1
Eden	1
were	1
no	1
Eden,	1
thus	1
exposed.	1
To	1
whom	1
thus	1
Adam	1
fervently	1
replied.	1
O	1
Woman,	1
best	1
are	1
all	1
things	1
as	1
the	1
will	1
Of	1
God	1
ordained	1
them:	1
His	1
creating	1
hand	1
Nothing	1
imperfect	1
or	1
deficient	1
left	1
Of	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
created,	1
much	1
less	1
Man,	1
Or	1
aught	1
that	1
might	1
his	1
happy	1
state	1
secure,	1
Secure	1
from	1
outward	1
force;	1
within	1
himself	1
The	1
danger	1
lies,	1
yet	1
lies	1
within	1
his	1
power:	1
Against	1
his	1
will	1
he	1
can	1
receive	1
no	1
harm.	1
But	1
God	1
left	1
free	1
the	1
will;	1
for	1
what	1
obeys	1
Reason,	1
is	1
free;	1
and	1
Reason	1
he	1
made	1
right,	1
But	1
bid	1
her	1
well	1
be	1
ware,	1
and	1
still	1
erect;	1
Lest,	1
by	1
some	1
fair-appearing	1
good	1
surprised,	1
She	1
dictate	1
false;	1
and	1
mis-inform	1
the	1
will	1
To	1
do	1
what	1
God	1
expressly	1
hath	1
forbid.	1
Not	1
then	1
mistrust,	1
but	1
tender	1
love,	1
enjoins,	1
That	1
I	1
should	1
mind	1
thee	1
oft;	1
and	1
mind	1
thou	1
me.	1
Firm	1
we	1
subsist,	1
yet	1
possible	1
to	1
swerve;	1
Since	1
Reason	1
not	1
impossibly	1
may	1
meet	1
Some	1
specious	1
object	1
by	1
the	1
foe	1
suborned,	1
And	1
fall	1
into	1
deception	1
unaware,	1
Not	1
keeping	1
strictest	1
watch,	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
warned.	1
Seek	1
not	1
temptation	1
then,	1
which	1
to	1
avoid	1
Were	1
better,	1
and	1
most	1
likely	1
if	1
from	1
me	1
Thou	1
sever	1
not:	1
Trial	1
will	1
come	1
unsought.	1
Wouldst	1
thou	1
approve	1
thy	1
constancy,	1
approve	1
First	1
thy	1
obedience;	1
the	1
other	1
who	1
can	1
know,	1
Not	1
seeing	1
thee	1
attempted,	1
who	1
attest?	1
But,	1
if	1
thou	1
think,	1
trial	1
unsought	1
may	1
find	1
Us	1
both	1
securer	1
than	1
thus	1
warned	1
thou	1
seemest,	1
Go;	1
for	1
thy	1
stay,	1
not	1
free,	1
absents	1
thee	1
more;	1
Go	1
in	1
thy	1
native	1
innocence,	1
rely	1
On	1
what	1
thou	1
hast	1
of	1
virtue;	1
summon	1
all!	1
For	1
God	1
towards	1
thee	1
hath	1
done	1
his	1
part,	1
do	1
thine.	1
So	1
spake	1
the	1
patriarch	1
of	1
mankind;	1
but	1
Eve	1
Persisted;	1
yet	1
submiss,	1
though	1
last,	1
replied.	1
With	1
thy	1
permission	1
then,	1
and	1
thus	1
forewarned	1
Chiefly	1
by	1
what	1
thy	1
own	1
last	1
reasoning	1
words	1
Touched	1
only;	1
that	1
our	1
trial,	1
when	1
least	1
sought,	1
May	1
find	1
us	1
both	1
perhaps	1
far	1
less	1
prepared,	1
The	1
willinger	1
I	1
go,	1
nor	1
much	1
expect	1
A	1
foe	1
so	1
proud	1
will	1
first	1
the	1
weaker	1
seek;	1
So	1
bent,	1
the	1
more	1
shall	1
shame	1
him	1
his	1
repulse.	1
Thus	1
saying,	1
from	1
her	1
husband's	1
hand	1
her	1
hand	1
Soft	1
she	1
withdrew;	1
and,	1
like	1
a	1
Wood-Nymph	1
light,	1
Oread	1
or	1
Dryad,	1
or	1
of	1
Delia's	1
train,	1
Betook	1
her	1
to	1
the	1
groves;	1
but	1
Delia's	1
self	1
In	1
gait	1
surpassed,	1
and	1
Goddess-like	1
deport,	1
Though	1
not	1
as	1
she	1
with	1
bow	1
and	1
quiver	1
armed,	1
But	1
with	1
such	1
gardening	1
tools	1
as	1
Art	1
yet	1
rude,	1
Guiltless	1
of	1
fire,	1
had	1
formed,	1
or	1
Angels	1
brought.	1
To	1
Pales,	1
or	1
Pomona,	1
thus	1
adorned,	1
Likest	1
she	1
seemed,	1
Pomona	1
when	1
she	1
fled	1
Vertumnus,	1
or	1
to	1
Ceres	1
in	1
her	1
prime,	1
Yet	1
virgin	1
of	1
Proserpina	1
from	1
Jove.	1
Her	1
long	1
with	1
ardent	1
look	1
his	1
eye	1
pursued	1
Delighted,	1
but	1
desiring	1
more	1
her	1
stay.	1
Oft	1
he	1
to	1
her	1
his	1
charge	1
of	1
quick	1
return	1
Repeated;	1
she	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
oft	1
engaged	1
To	1
be	1
returned	1
by	1
noon	1
amid	1
the	1
bower,	1
And	1
all	1
things	1
in	1
best	1
order	1
to	1
invite	1
Noontide	1
repast,	1
or	1
afternoon's	1
repose.	1
O	1
much	1
deceived,	1
much	1
failing,	1
hapless	1
Eve,	1
Of	1
thy	1
presumed	1
return!	1
event	1
perverse!	1
Thou	1
never	1
from	1
that	1
hour	1
in	1
Paradise	1
Foundst	1
either	1
sweet	1
repast,	1
or	1
sound	1
repose;	1
Such	1
ambush,	1
hid	1
among	1
sweet	1
flowers	1
and	1
shades,	1
Waited	1
with	1
hellish	1
rancour	1
imminent	1
To	1
intercept	1
thy	1
way,	1
or	1
send	1
thee	1
back	1
Despoiled	1
of	1
innocence,	1
of	1
faith,	1
of	1
bliss!	1
For	1
now,	1
and	1
since	1
first	1
break	1
of	1
dawn,	1
the	1
Fiend,	1
Mere	1
serpent	1
in	1
appearance,	1
forth	1
was	1
come;	1
And	1
on	1
his	1
quest,	1
where	1
likeliest	1
he	1
might	1
find	1
The	1
only	1
two	1
of	1
mankind,	1
but	1
in	1
them	1
The	1
whole	1
included	1
race,	1
his	1
purposed	1
prey.	1
In	1
bower	1
and	1
field	1
he	1
sought,	1
where	1
any	1
tuft	1
Of	1
grove	1
or	1
garden-plot	1
more	1
pleasant	1
lay,	1
Their	1
tendance,	1
or	1
plantation	1
for	1
delight;	1
By	1
fountain	1
or	1
by	1
shady	1
rivulet	1
He	1
sought	1
them	1
both,	1
but	1
wished	1
his	1
hap	1
might	1
find	1
Eve	1
separate;	1
he	1
wished,	1
but	1
not	1
with	1
hope	1
Of	1
what	1
so	1
seldom	1
chanced;	1
when	1
to	1
his	1
wish,	1
Beyond	1
his	1
hope,	1
Eve	1
separate	1
he	1
spies,	1
Veiled	1
in	1
a	1
cloud	1
of	1
fragrance,	1
where	1
she	1
stood,	1
Half	1
spied,	1
so	1
thick	1
the	1
roses	1
blushing	1
round	1
About	1
her	1
glowed,	1
oft	1
stooping	1
to	1
support	1
Each	1
flower	1
of	1
slender	1
stalk,	1
whose	1
head,	1
though	1
gay	1
Carnation,	1
purple,	1
azure,	1
or	1
specked	1
with	1
gold,	1
Hung	1
drooping	1
unsustained;	1
them	1
she	1
upstays	1
Gently	1
with	1
myrtle	1
band,	1
mindless	1
the	1
while	1
Herself,	1
though	1
fairest	1
unsupported	1
flower,	1
From	1
her	1
best	1
prop	1
so	1
far,	1
and	1
storm	1
so	1
nigh.	1
Nearer	1
he	1
drew,	1
and	1
many	1
a	1
walk	1
traversed	1
Of	1
stateliest	1
covert,	1
cedar,	1
pine,	1
or	1
palm;	1
Then	1
voluble	1
and	1
bold,	1
now	1
hid,	1
now	1
seen,	1
Among	1
thick-woven	1
arborets,	1
and	1
flowers	1
Imbordered	1
on	1
each	1
bank,	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Eve:	1
Spot	1
more	1
delicious	1
than	1
those	1
gardens	1
feigned	1
Or	1
of	1
revived	1
Adonis,	1
or	1
renowned	1
Alcinous,	1
host	1
of	1
old	1
Laertes'	1
son;	1
Or	1
that,	1
not	1
mystick,	1
where	1
the	1
sapient	1
king	1
Held	1
dalliance	1
with	1
his	1
fair	1
Egyptian	1
spouse.	1
Much	1
he	1
the	1
place	1
admired,	1
the	1
person	1
more.	1
As	1
one	1
who	1
long	1
in	1
populous	1
city	1
pent,	1
Where	1
houses	1
thick	1
and	1
sewers	1
annoy	1
the	1
air,	1
Forth	1
issuing	1
on	1
a	1
summer's	1
morn,	1
to	1
breathe	1
Among	1
the	1
pleasant	1
villages	1
and	1
farms	1
Adjoined,	1
from	1
each	1
thing	1
met	1
conceives	1
delight;	1
The	1
smell	1
of	1
grain,	1
or	1
tedded	1
grass,	1
or	1
kine,	1
Or	1
dairy,	1
each	1
rural	1
sight,	1
each	1
rural	1
sound;	1
If	1
chance,	1
with	1
nymph-like	1
step,	1
fair	1
virgin	1
pass,	1
What	1
pleasing	1
seemed,	1
for	1
her	1
now	1
pleases	1
more;	1
She	1
most,	1
and	1
in	1
her	1
look	1
sums	1
all	1
delight:	1
Such	1
pleasure	1
took	1
the	1
Serpent	1
to	1
behold	1
This	1
flowery	1
plat,	1
the	1
sweet	1
recess	1
of	1
Eve	1
Thus	1
early,	1
thus	1
alone:	1
Her	1
heavenly	1
form	1
Angelick,	1
but	1
more	1
soft,	1
and	1
feminine,	1
Her	1
graceful	1
innocence,	1
her	1
every	1
air	1
Of	1
gesture,	1
or	1
least	1
action,	1
overawed	1
His	1
malice,	1
and	1
with	1
rapine	1
sweet	1
bereaved	1
His	1
fierceness	1
of	1
the	1
fierce	1
intent	1
it	1
brought:	1
That	1
space	1
the	1
Evil-one	1
abstracted	1
stood	1
From	1
his	1
own	1
evil,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
remained	1
Stupidly	1
good;	1
of	1
enmity	1
disarmed,	1
Of	1
guile,	1
of	1
hate,	1
of	1
envy,	1
of	1
revenge:	1
But	1
the	1
hot	1
Hell	1
that	1
always	1
in	1
him	1
burns,	1
Though	1
in	1
mid	1
Heaven,	1
soon	1
ended	1
his	1
delight,	1
And	1
tortures	1
him	1
now	1
more,	1
the	1
more	1
he	1
sees	1
Of	1
pleasure,	1
not	1
for	1
him	1
ordained:	1
then	1
soon	1
Fierce	1
hate	1
he	1
recollects,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
thoughts	1
Of	1
mischief,	1
gratulating,	1
thus	1
excites.	1
Thoughts,	1
whither	1
have	1
ye	1
led	1
me!	1
with	1
what	1
sweet	1
Compulsion	1
thus	1
transported,	1
to	1
forget	1
What	1
hither	1
brought	1
us!	1
hate,	1
not	1
love;nor	1
hope	1
Of	1
Paradise	1
for	1
Hell,	1
hope	1
here	1
to	1
taste	1
Of	1
pleasure;	1
but	1
all	1
pleasure	1
to	1
destroy,	1
Save	1
what	1
is	1
in	1
destroying;	1
other	1
joy	1
To	1
me	1
is	1
lost.	1
Then,	1
let	1
me	1
not	1
let	1
pass	1
Occasion	1
which	1
now	1
smiles;	1
behold	1
alone	1
The	1
woman,	1
opportune	1
to	1
all	1
attempts,	1
Her	1
husband,	1
for	1
I	1
view	1
far	1
round,	1
not	1
nigh,	1
Whose	1
higher	1
intellectual	1
more	1
I	1
shun,	1
And	1
strength,	1
of	1
courage	1
haughty,	1
and	1
of	1
limb	1
Heroick	1
built,	1
though	1
of	1
terrestrial	1
mould;	1
Foe	1
not	1
informidable!	1
exempt	1
from	1
wound,	1
I	1
not;	1
so	1
much	1
hath	1
Hell	1
debased,	1
and	1
pain	1
Enfeebled	1
me,	1
to	1
what	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
Heaven.	1
She	1
fair,	1
divinely	1
fair,	1
fit	1
love	1
for	1
Gods!	1
Not	1
terrible,	1
though	1
terrour	1
be	1
in	1
love	1
And	1
beauty,	1
not	1
approached	1
by	1
stronger	1
hate,	1
Hate	1
stronger,	1
under	1
show	1
of	1
love	1
well	1
feigned;	1
The	1
way	1
which	1
to	1
her	1
ruin	1
now	1
I	1
tend.	1
So	1
spake	1
the	1
enemy	1
of	1
mankind,	1
enclosed	1
In	1
serpent,	1
inmate	1
bad!	1
and	1
toward	1
Eve	1
Addressed	1
his	1
way:	1
not	1
with	1
indented	1
wave,	1
Prone	1
on	1
the	1
ground,	1
as	1
since;	1
but	1
on	1
his	1
rear,	1
Circular	1
base	1
of	1
rising	1
folds,	1
that	1
towered	1
Fold	1
above	1
fold,	1
a	1
surging	1
maze!	1
his	1
head	1
Crested	1
aloft,	1
and	1
carbuncle	1
his	1
eyes;	1
With	1
burnished	1
neck	1
of	1
verdant	1
gold,	1
erect	1
Amidst	1
his	1
circling	1
spires,	1
that	1
on	1
the	1
grass	1
Floated	1
redundant:	1
pleasing	1
was	1
his	1
shape	1
And	1
lovely;	1
never	1
since	1
of	1
serpent-kind	1
Lovelier,	1
not	1
those	1
that	1
in	1
Illyria	1
changed,	1
Hermione	1
and	1
Cadmus,	1
or	1
the	1
god	1
In	1
Epidaurus;	1
nor	1
to	1
which	1
transformed	1
Ammonian	1
Jove,	1
or	1
Capitoline,	1
was	1
seen;	1
He	1
with	1
Olympias;	1
this	1
with	1
her	1
who	1
bore	1
Scipio,	1
the	1
highth	1
of	1
Rome.	1
With	1
tract	1
oblique	1
At	1
first,	1
as	1
one	1
who	1
sought	1
access,	1
but	1
feared	1
To	1
interrupt,	1
side-long	1
he	1
works	1
his	1
way.	1
As	1
when	1
a	1
ship,	1
by	1
skilful	1
steersmen	1
wrought	1
Nigh	1
river's	1
mouth	1
or	1
foreland,	1
where	1
the	1
wind	1
Veers	1
oft,	1
as	1
oft	1
so	1
steers,	1
and	1
shifts	1
her	1
sail:	1
So	1
varied	1
he,	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
tortuous	1
train	1
Curled	1
many	1
a	1
wanton	1
wreath	1
in	1
sight	1
of	1
Eve,	1
To	1
lure	1
her	1
eye;	1
she,	1
busied,	1
heard	1
the	1
sound	1
Of	1
rusling	1
leaves,	1
but	1
minded	1
not,	1
as	1
used	1
To	1
such	1
disport	1
before	1
her	1
through	1
the	1
field,	1
From	1
every	1
beast;	1
more	1
duteous	1
at	1
her	1
call,	1
Than	1
at	1
Circean	1
call	1
the	1
herd	1
disguised.	1
He,	1
bolder	1
now,	1
uncalled	1
before	1
her	1
stood,	1
But	1
as	1
in	1
gaze	1
admiring:	1
oft	1
he	1
bowed	1
His	1
turret	1
crest,	1
and	1
sleek	1
enamelled	1
neck,	1
Fawning;	1
and	1
licked	1
the	1
ground	1
whereon	1
she	1
trod.	1
His	1
gentle	1
dumb	1
expression	1
turned	1
at	1
length	1
The	1
eye	1
of	1
Eve	1
to	1
mark	1
his	1
play;	1
he,	1
glad	1
Of	1
her	1
attention	1
gained,	1
with	1
serpent-tongue	1
Organick,	1
or	1
impulse	1
of	1
vocal	1
air,	1
His	1
fraudulent	1
temptation	1
thus	1
began.	1
Wonder	1
not,	1
sovran	1
Mistress,	1
if	1
perhaps	1
Thou	1
canst,	1
who	1
art	1
sole	1
wonder!	1
much	1
less	1
arm	1
Thy	1
looks,	1
the	1
Heaven	1
of	1
mildness,	1
with	1
disdain,	1
Displeased	1
that	1
I	1
approach	1
thee	1
thus,	1
and	1
gaze	1
Insatiate;	1
I	1
thus	1
single;nor	1
have	1
feared	1
Thy	1
awful	1
brow,	1
more	1
awful	1
thus	1
retired.	1
Fairest	1
resemblance	1
of	1
thy	1
Maker	1
fair,	1
Thee	1
all	1
things	1
living	1
gaze	1
on,	1
all	1
things	1
thine	1
By	1
gift,	1
and	1
thy	1
celestial	1
beauty	1
adore	1
With	1
ravishment	1
beheld!	1
there	1
best	1
beheld,	1
Where	1
universally	1
admired;	1
but	1
here	1
In	1
this	1
enclosure	1
wild,	1
these	1
beasts	1
among,	1
Beholders	1
rude,	1
and	1
shallow	1
to	1
discern	1
Half	1
what	1
in	1
thee	1
is	1
fair,	1
one	1
man	1
except,	1
Who	1
sees	1
thee?	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
one?	1
who	1
should	1
be	1
seen	1
A	1
Goddess	1
among	1
Gods,	1
adored	1
and	1
served	1
By	1
Angels	1
numberless,	1
thy	1
daily	1
train.	1
So	1
glozed	1
the	1
Tempter,	1
and	1
his	1
proem	1
tuned:	1
Into	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
Eve	1
his	1
words	1
made	1
way,	1
Though	1
at	1
the	1
voice	1
much	1
marvelling;	1
at	1
length,	1
Not	1
unamazed,	1
she	1
thus	1
in	1
answer	1
spake.	1
What	1
may	1
this	1
mean?	1
language	1
of	1
man	1
pronounced	1
By	1
tongue	1
of	1
brute,	1
and	1
human	1
sense	1
expressed?	1
The	1
first,	1
at	1
least,	1
of	1
these	1
I	1
thought	1
denied	1
To	1
beasts;	1
whom	1
God,	1
on	1
their	1
creation-day,	1
Created	1
mute	1
to	1
all	1
articulate	1
sound:	1
The	1
latter	1
I	1
demur;	1
for	1
in	1
their	1
looks	1
Much	1
reason,	1
and	1
in	1
their	1
actions,	1
oft	1
appears.	1
Thee,	1
Serpent,	1
subtlest	1
beast	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
field	1
I	1
knew,	1
but	1
not	1
with	1
human	1
voice	1
endued;	1
Redouble	1
then	1
this	1
miracle,	1
and	1
say,	1
How	1
camest	1
thou	1
speakable	1
of	1
mute,	1
and	1
how	1
To	1
me	1
so	1
friendly	1
grown	1
above	1
the	1
rest	1
Of	1
brutal	1
kind,	1
that	1
daily	1
are	1
in	1
sight?	1
Say,	1
for	1
such	1
wonder	1
claims	1
attention	1
due.	1
To	1
whom	1
the	1
guileful	1
Tempter	1
thus	1
replied.	1
Empress	1
of	1
this	1
fair	1
world,	1
resplendent	1
Eve!	1
Easy	1
to	1
me	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
tell	1
thee	1
all	1
What	1
thou	1
commandest;	1
and	1
right	1
thou	1
shouldst	1
be	1
obeyed:	1
I	1
was	1
at	1
first	1
as	1
other	1
beasts	1
that	1
graze	1
The	1
trodden	1
herb,	1
of	1
abject	1
thoughts	1
and	1
low,	1
As	1
was	1
my	1
food;	1
nor	1
aught	1
but	1
food	1
discerned	1
Or	1
sex,	1
and	1
apprehended	1
nothing	1
high:	1
Till,	1
on	1
a	1
day	1
roving	1
the	1
field,	1
I	1
chanced	1
A	1
goodly	1
tree	1
far	1
distant	1
to	1
behold	1
Loaden	1
with	1
fruit	1
of	1
fairest	1
colours	1
mixed,	1
Ruddy	1
and	1
gold:	1
I	1
nearer	1
drew	1
to	1
gaze;	1
When	1
from	1
the	1
boughs	1
a	1
savoury	1
odour	1
blown,	1
Grateful	1
to	1
appetite,	1
more	1
pleased	1
my	1
sense	1
Than	1
smell	1
of	1
sweetest	1
fennel,	1
or	1
the	1
teats	1
Of	1
ewe	1
or	1
goat	1
dropping	1
with	1
milk	1
at	1
even,	1
Unsucked	1
of	1
lamb	1
or	1
kid,	1
that	1
tend	1
their	1
play.	1
To	1
satisfy	1
the	1
sharp	1
desire	1
I	1
had	1
Of	1
tasting	1
those	1
fair	1
apples,	1
I	1
resolved	1
Not	1
to	1
defer;	1
hunger	1
and	1
thirst	1
at	1
once,	1
Powerful	1
persuaders,	1
quickened	1
at	1
the	1
scent	1
Of	1
that	1
alluring	1
fruit,	1
urged	1
me	1
so	1
keen.	1
About	1
the	1
mossy	1
trunk	1
I	1
wound	1
me	1
soon;	1
For,	1
high	1
from	1
ground,	1
the	1
branches	1
would	1
require	1
Thy	1
utmost	1
reach	1
or	1
Adam's:	1
Round	1
the	1
tree	1
All	1
other	1
beasts	1
that	1
saw,	1
with	1
like	1
desire	1
Longing	1
and	1
envying	1
stood,	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
reach.	1
Amid	1
the	1
tree	1
now	1
got,	1
where	1
plenty	1
hung	1
Tempting	1
so	1
nigh,	1
to	1
pluck	1
and	1
eat	1
my	1
fill	1
I	1
spared	1
not;	1
for,	1
such	1
pleasure	1
till	1
that	1
hour,	1
At	1
feed	1
or	1
fountain,	1
never	1
had	1
I	1
found.	1
Sated	1
at	1
length,	1
ere	1
long	1
I	1
might	1
perceive	1
Strange	1
alteration	1
in	1
me,	1
to	1
degree	1
Of	1
reason	1
in	1
my	1
inward	1
powers;	1
and	1
speech	1
Wanted	1
not	1
long;	1
though	1
to	1
this	1
shape	1
retained.	1
Thenceforth	1
to	1
speculations	1
high	1
or	1
deep	1
I	1
turned	1
my	1
thoughts,	1
and	1
with	1
capacious	1
mind	1
Considered	1
all	1
things	1
visible	1
in	1
Heaven,	1
Or	1
Earth,	1
or	1
Middle;	1
all	1
things	1
fair	1
and	1
good:	1
But	1
all	1
that	1
fair	1
and	1
good	1
in	1
thy	1
divine	1
Semblance,	1
and	1
in	1
thy	1
beauty's	1
heavenly	1
ray,	1
United	1
I	1
beheld;	1
no	1
fair	1
to	1
thine	1
Equivalent	1
or	1
second!	1
which	1
compelled	1
Me	1
thus,	1
though	1
importune	1
perhaps,	1
to	1
come	1
And	1
gaze,	1
and	1
worship	1
thee	1
of	1
right	1
declared	1
Sovran	1
of	1
creatures,	1
universal	1
Dame!	1
So	1
talked	1
the	1
spirited	1
sly	1
Snake;	1
and	1
Eve,	1
Yet	1
more	1
amazed,	1
unwary	1
thus	1
replied.	1
Serpent,	1
thy	1
overpraising	1
leaves	1
in	1
doubt	1
The	1
virtue	1
of	1
that	1
fruit,	1
in	1
thee	1
first	1
proved:	1
But	1
say,	1
where	1
grows	1
the	1
tree?	1
from	1
hence	1
how	1
far?	1
For	1
many	1
are	1
the	1
trees	1
of	1
God	1
that	1
grow	1
In	1
Paradise,	1
and	1
various,	1
yet	1
unknown	1
To	1
us;	1
in	1
such	1
abundance	1
lies	1
our	1
choice,	1
As	1
leaves	1
a	1
greater	1
store	1
of	1
fruit	1
untouched,	1
Still	1
hanging	1
incorruptible,	1
till	1
men	1
Grow	1
up	1
to	1
their	1
provision,	1
and	1
more	1
hands	1
Help	1
to	1
disburden	1
Nature	1
of	1
her	1
birth.	1
To	1
whom	1
the	1
wily	1
Adder,	1
blithe	1
and	1
glad.	1
Empress,	1
the	1
way	1
is	1
ready,	1
and	1
not	1
long;	1
Beyond	1
a	1
row	1
of	1
myrtles,	1
on	1
a	1
flat,	1
Fast	1
by	1
a	1
fountain,	1
one	1
small	1
thicket	1
past	1
Of	1
blowing	1
myrrh	1
and	1
balm:	1
if	1
thou	1
accept	1
My	1
conduct,	1
I	1
can	1
bring	1
thee	1
thither	1
soon	1
Lead	1
then,	1
said	1
Eve.	1
He,	1
leading,	1
swiftly	1
rolled	1
In	1
tangles,	1
and	1
made	1
intricate	1
seem	1
straight,	1
To	1
mischief	1
swift.	1
Hope	1
elevates,	1
and	1
joy	1
Brightens	1
his	1
crest;	1
as	1
when	1
a	1
wandering	1
fire,	1
Compact	1
of	1
unctuous	1
vapour,	1
which	1
the	1
night	1
Condenses,	1
and	1
the	1
cold	1
environs	1
round,	1
Kindled	1
through	1
agitation	1
to	1
a	1
flame,	1
Which	1
oft,	1
they	1
say,	1
some	1
evil	1
Spirit	1
attends,	1
Hovering	1
and	1
blazing	1
with	1
delusive	1
light,	1
Misleads	1
the	1
amazed	1
night-wanderer	1
from	1
his	1
way	1
To	1
bogs	1
and	1
mires,	1
and	1
oft	1
through	1
pond	1
or	1
pool;	1
There	1
swallowed	1
up	1
and	1
lost,	1
from	1
succour	1
far.	1
So	1
glistered	1
the	1
dire	1
Snake,	1
and	1
into	1
fraud	1
Led	1
Eve,	1
our	1
credulous	1
mother,	1
to	1
the	1
tree	1
Of	1
prohibition,	1
root	1
of	1
all	1
our	1
woe;	1
Which	1
when	1
she	1
saw,	1
thus	1
to	1
her	1
guide	1
she	1
spake.	1
Serpent,	1
we	1
might	1
have	1
spared	1
our	1
coming	1
hither,	1
Fruitless	1
to	1
me,	1
though	1
fruit	1
be	1
here	1
to	1
excess,	1
The	1
credit	1
of	1
whose	1
virtue	1
rest	1
with	1
thee;	1
Wonderous	1
indeed,	1
if	1
cause	1
of	1
such	1
effects.	1
But	1
of	1
this	1
tree	1
we	1
may	1
not	1
taste	1
nor	1
touch;	1
God	1
so	1
commanded,	1
and	1
left	1
that	1
command	1
Sole	1
daughter	1
of	1
his	1
voice;	1
the	1
rest,	1
we	1
live	1
Law	1
to	1
ourselves;	1
our	1
reason	1
is	1
our	1
law.	1
To	1
whom	1
the	1
Tempter	1
guilefully	1
replied.	1
Indeed!	1
hath	1
God	1
then	1
said	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
fruit	1
Of	1
all	1
these	1
garden-trees	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
eat,	1
Yet	1
Lords	1
declared	1
of	1
all	1
in	1
earth	1
or	1
air$?	1
To	1
whom	1
thus	1
Eve,	1
yet	1
sinless.	1
Of	1
the	1
fruit	1
Of	1
each	1
tree	1
in	1
the	1
garden	1
we	1
may	1
eat;	1
But	1
of	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
this	1
fair	1
tree	1
amidst	1
The	1
garden,	1
God	1
hath	1
said,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
not	1
eat	1
Thereof,	1
nor	1
shall	1
ye	1
touch	1
it,	1
lest	1
ye	1
die.	1
She	1
scarce	1
had	1
said,	1
though	1
brief,	1
when	1
now	1
more	1
bold	1
The	1
Tempter,	1
but	1
with	1
show	1
of	1
zeal	1
and	1
love	1
To	1
Man,	1
and	1
indignation	1
at	1
his	1
wrong,	1
New	1
part	1
puts	1
on;	1
and,	1
as	1
to	1
passion	1
moved,	1
Fluctuates	1
disturbed,	1
yet	1
comely	1
and	1
in	1
act	1
Raised,	1
as	1
of	1
some	1
great	1
matter	1
to	1
begin.	1
As	1
when	1
of	1
old	1
some	1
orator	1
renowned,	1
In	1
Athens	1
or	1
free	1
Rome,	1
where	1
eloquence	1
Flourished,	1
since	1
mute!	1
to	1
some	1
great	1
cause	1
addressed,	1
Stood	1
in	1
himself	1
collected;	1
while	1
each	1
part,	1
Motion,	1
each	1
act,	1
won	1
audience	1
ere	1
the	1
tongue;	1
Sometimes	1
in	1
highth	1
began,	1
as	1
no	1
delay	1
Of	1
preface	1
brooking,	1
through	1
his	1
zeal	1
of	1
right:	1
So	1
standing,	1
moving,	1
or	1
to	1
highth	1
up	1
grown,	1
The	1
Tempter,	1
all	1
impassioned,	1
thus	1
began.	1
O	1
sacred,	1
wise,	1
and	1
wisdom-giving	1
Plant,	1
Mother	1
of	1
science!	1
now	1
I	1
feel	1
thy	1
power	1
Within	1
me	1
clear;	1
not	1
only	1
to	1
discern	1
Things	1
in	1
their	1
causes,	1
but	1
to	1
trace	1
the	1
ways	1
Of	1
highest	1
agents,	1
deemed	1
however	1
wise.	1
Queen	1
of	1
this	1
universe!	1
do	1
not	1
believe	1
Those	1
rigid	1
threats	1
of	1
death:	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
die:	1
How	1
should	1
you?	1
by	1
the	1
fruit?	1
it	1
gives	1
you	1
life	1
To	1
knowledge;	1
by	1
the	1
threatener?	1
look	1
on	1
me,	1
Me,	1
who	1
have	1
touched	1
and	1
tasted;	1
yet	1
both	1
live,	1
And	1
life	1
more	1
perfect	1
have	1
attained	1
than	1
Fate	1
Meant	1
me,	1
by	1
venturing	1
higher	1
than	1
my	1
lot.	1
Shall	1
that	1
be	1
shut	1
to	1
Man,	1
which	1
to	1
the	1
Beast	1
Is	1
open?	1
or	1
will	1
God	1
incense	1
his	1
ire	1
For	1
such	1
a	1
petty	1
trespass?	1
and	1
not	1
praise	1
Rather	1
your	1
dauntless	1
virtue,	1
whom	1
the	1
pain	1
Of	1
death	1
denounced,	1
whatever	1
thing	1
death	1
be,	1
Deterred	1
not	1
from	1
achieving	1
what	1
might	1
lead	1
To	1
happier	1
life,	1
knowledge	1
of	1
good	1
and	1
evil;	1
Of	1
good,	1
how	1
just?	1
of	1
evil,	1
if	1
what	1
is	1
evil	1
Be	1
real,	1
why	1
not	1
known,	1
since	1
easier	1
shunned?	1
God	1
therefore	1
cannot	1
hurt	1
ye,	1
and	1
be	1
just;	1
Not	1
just,	1
not	1
God;	1
not	1
feared	1
then,	1
nor	1
obeyed:	1
Your	1
fear	1
itself	1
of	1
death	1
removes	1
the	1
fear.	1
Why	1
then	1
was	1
this	1
forbid?	1
Why,	1
but	1
to	1
awe;	1
Why,	1
but	1
to	1
keep	1
ye	1
low	1
and	1
ignorant,	1
His	1
worshippers?	1
He	1
knows	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
Ye	1
eat	1
thereof,	1
your	1
eyes	1
that	1
seem	1
so	1
clear,	1
Yet	1
are	1
but	1
dim,	1
shall	1
perfectly	1
be	1
then	1
Opened	1
and	1
cleared,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
Gods,	1
Knowing	1
both	1
good	1
and	1
evil,	1
as	1
they	1
know.	1
That	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
Gods,	1
since	1
I	1
as	1
Man,	1
Internal	1
Man,	1
is	1
but	1
proportion	1
meet;	1
I,	1
of	1
brute,	1
human;	1
ye,	1
of	1
human,	1
Gods.	1
So	1
ye	1
shall	1
die	1
perhaps,	1
by	1
putting	1
off	1
Human,	1
to	1
put	1
on	1
Gods;	1
death	1
to	1
be	1
wished,	1
Though	1
threatened,	1
which	1
no	1
worse	1
than	1
this	1
can	1
bring.	1
And	1
what	1
are	1
Gods,	1
that	1
Man	1
may	1
not	1
become	1
As	1
they,	1
participating	1
God-like	1
food?	1
The	1
Gods	1
are	1
first,	1
and	1
that	1
advantage	1
use	1
On	1
our	1
belief,	1
that	1
all	1
from	1
them	1
proceeds:	1
I	1
question	1
it;	1
for	1
this	1
fair	1
earth	1
I	1
see,	1
Warmed	1
by	1
the	1
sun,	1
producing	1
every	1
kind;	1
Them,	1
nothing:	1
if	1
they	1
all	1
things,	1
who	1
enclosed	1
Knowledge	1
of	1
good	1
and	1
evil	1
in	1
this	1
tree,	1
That	1
whoso	1
eats	1
thereof,	1
forthwith	1
attains	1
Wisdom	1
without	1
their	1
leave?	1
and	1
wherein	1
lies	1
The	1
offence,	1
that	1
Man	1
should	1
thus	1
attain	1
to	1
know?	1
What	1
can	1
your	1
knowledge	1
hurt	1
him,	1
or	1
this	1
tree	1
Impart	1
against	1
his	1
will,	1
if	1
all	1
be	1
his?	1
Or	1
is	1
it	1
envy?	1
and	1
can	1
envy	1
dwell	1
In	1
heavenly	1
breasts?	1
These,	1
these,	1
and	1
many	1
more	1
Causes	1
import	1
your	1
need	1
of	1
this	1
fair	1
fruit.	1
Goddess	1
humane,	1
reach	1
then,	1
and	1
freely	1
taste!	1
He	1
ended;	1
and	1
his	1
words,	1
replete	1
with	1
guile,	1
Into	1
her	1
heart	1
too	1
easy	1
entrance	1
won:	1
Fixed	1
on	1
the	1
fruit	1
she	1
gazed,	1
which	1
to	1
behold	1
Might	1
tempt	1
alone;	1
and	1
in	1
her	1
ears	1
the	1
sound	1
Yet	1
rung	1
of	1
his	1
persuasive	1
words,	1
impregned	1
With	1
reason,	1
to	1
her	1
seeming,	1
and	1
with	1
truth:	1
Mean	1
while	1
the	1
hour	1
of	1
noon	1
drew	1
on,	1
and	1
waked	1
An	1
eager	1
appetite,	1
raised	1
by	1
the	1
smell	1
So	1
savoury	1
of	1
that	1
fruit,	1
which	1
with	1
desire,	1
Inclinable	1
now	1
grown	1
to	1
touch	1
or	1
taste,	1
Solicited	1
her	1
longing	1
eye;	1
yet	1
first	1
Pausing	1
a	1
while,	1
thus	1
to	1
herself	1
she	1
mused.	1
Great	1
are	1
thy	1
virtues,	1
doubtless,	1
best	1
of	1
fruits,	1
Though	1
kept	1
from	1
man,	1
and	1
worthy	1
to	1
be	1
admired;	1
Whose	1
taste,	1
too	1
long	1
forborn,	1
at	1
first	1
assay	1
Gave	1
elocution	1
to	1
the	1
mute,	1
and	1
taught	1
The	1
tongue	1
not	1
made	1
for	1
speech	1
to	1
speak	1
thy	1
praise:	1
Thy	1
praise	1
he	1
also,	1
who	1
forbids	1
thy	1
use,	1
Conceals	1
not	1
from	1
us,	1
naming	1
thee	1
the	1
tree	1
Of	1
knowledge,	1
knowledge	1
both	1
of	1
good	1
and	1
evil;	1
Forbids	1
us	1
then	1
to	1
taste!	1
but	1
his	1
forbidding	1
Commends	1
thee	1
more,	1
while	1
it	1
infers	1
the	1
good	1
By	1
thee	1
communicated,	1
and	1
our	1
want:	1
For	1
good	1
unknown	1
sure	1
is	1
not	1
had;	1
or,	1
had	1
And	1
yet	1
unknown,	1
is	1
as	1
not	1
had	1
at	1
all.	1
In	1
plain	1
then,	1
what	1
forbids	1
he	1
but	1
to	1
know,	1
Forbids	1
us	1
good,	1
forbids	1
us	1
to	1
be	1
wise?	1
Such	1
prohibitions	1
bind	1
not.	1
But,	1
if	1
death	1
Bind	1
us	1
with	1
after-bands,	1
what	1
profits	1
then	1
Our	1
inward	1
freedom?	1
In	1
the	1
day	1
we	1
eat	1
Of	1
this	1
fair	1
fruit,	1
our	1
doom	1
is,	1
we	1
shall	1
die!	1
How	1
dies	1
the	1
Serpent?	1
he	1
hath	1
eaten	1
and	1
lives,	1
And	1
knows,	1
and	1
speaks,	1
and	1
reasons,	1
and	1
discerns,	1
Irrational	1
till	1
then.	1
For	1
us	1
alone	1
Was	1
death	1
invented?	1
or	1
to	1
us	1
denied	1
This	1
intellectual	1
food,	1
for	1
beasts	1
reserved?	1
For	1
beasts	1
it	1
seems:	1
yet	1
that	1
one	1
beast	1
which	1
first	1
Hath	1
tasted	1
envies	1
not,	1
but	1
brings	1
with	1
joy	1
The	1
good	1
befallen	1
him,	1
author	1
unsuspect,	1
Friendly	1
to	1
man,	1
far	1
from	1
deceit	1
or	1
guile.	1
What	1
fear	1
I	1
then?	1
rather,	1
what	1
know	1
to	1
fear	1
Under	1
this	1
ignorance	1
of	1
good	1
and	1
evil,	1
Of	1
God	1
or	1
death,	1
of	1
law	1
or	1
penalty?	1
Here	1
grows	1
the	1
cure	1
of	1
all,	1
this	1
fruit	1
divine,	1
Fair	1
to	1
the	1
eye,	1
inviting	1
to	1
the	1
taste,	1
Of	1
virtue	1
to	1
make	1
wise:	1
What	1
hinders	1
then	1
To	1
reach,	1
and	1
feed	1
at	1
once	1
both	1
body	1
and	1
mind?	1
So	1
saying,	1
her	1
rash	1
hand	1
in	1
evil	1
hour	1
Forth	1
reaching	1
to	1
the	1
fruit,	1
she	1
plucked,	1
she	1
eat!	1
Earth	1
felt	1
the	1
wound;	1
and	1
Nature	1
from	1
her	1
seat,	1
Sighing	1
through	1
all	1
her	1
works,	1
gave	1
signs	1
of	1
woe,	1
That	1
all	1
was	1
lost.	1
Back	1
to	1
the	1
thicket	1
slunk	1
The	1
guilty	1
Serpent;	1
and	1
well	1
might;for	1
Eve,	1
Intent	1
now	1
wholly	1
on	1
her	1
taste,	1
nought	1
else	1
Regarded;	1
such	1
delight	1
till	1
then,	1
as	1
seemed,	1
In	1
fruit	1
she	1
never	1
tasted,	1
whether	1
true	1
Or	1
fancied	1
so,	1
through	1
expectation	1
high	1
Of	1
knowledge;	1
not	1
was	1
Godhead	1
from	1
her	1
thought.	1
Greedily	1
she	1
ingorged	1
without	1
restraint,	1
And	1
knew	1
not	1
eating	1
death:	1
Satiate	1
at	1
length,	1
And	1
hightened	1
as	1
with	1
wine,	1
jocund	1
and	1
boon,	1
Thus	1
to	1
herself	1
she	1
pleasingly	1
began.	1
O	1
sovran,	1
virtuous,	1
precious	1
of	1
all	1
trees	1
In	1
Paradise!	1
of	1
operation	1
blest	1
To	1
sapience,	1
hitherto	1
obscured,	1
infamed.	1
And	1
thy	1
fair	1
fruit	1
let	1
hang,	1
as	1
to	1
no	1
end	1
Created;	1
but	1
henceforth	1
my	1
early	1
care,	1
Not	1
without	1
song,	1
each	1
morning,	1
and	1
due	1
praise,	1
Shall	1
tend	1
thee,	1
and	1
the	1
fertile	1
burden	1
ease	1
Of	1
thy	1
full	1
branches	1
offered	1
free	1
to	1
all;	1
Till,	1
dieted	1
by	1
thee,	1
I	1
grow	1
mature	1
In	1
knowledge,	1
as	1
the	1
Gods,	1
who	1
all	1
things	1
know;	1
Though	1
others	1
envy	1
what	1
they	1
cannot	1
give:	1
For,	1
had	1
the	1
gift	1
been	1
theirs,	1
it	1
had	1
not	1
here	1
Thus	1
grown.	1
Experience,	1
next,	1
to	1
thee	1
I	1
owe,	1
Best	1
guide;	1
not	1
following	1
thee,	1
I	1
had	1
remained	1
In	1
ignorance;	1
thou	1
openest	1
wisdom's	1
way,	1
And	1
givest	1
access,	1
though	1
secret	1
she	1
retire.	1
And	1
I	1
perhaps	1
am	1
secret:	1
Heaven	1
is	1
high,	1
High,	1
and	1
remote	1
to	1
see	1
from	1
thence	1
distinct	1
Each	1
thing	1
on	1
Earth;	1
and	1
other	1
care	1
perhaps	1
May	1
have	1
diverted	1
from	1
continual	1
watch	1
Our	1
great	1
Forbidder,	1
safe	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
spies	1
About	1
him.	1
But	1
to	1
Adam	1
in	1
what	1
sort	1
Shall	1
I	1
appear?	1
shall	1
I	1
to	1
him	1
make	1
known	1
As	1
yet	1
my	1
change,	1
and	1
give	1
him	1
to	1
partake	1
Full	1
happiness	1
with	1
me,	1
or	1
rather	1
not,	1
But	1
keeps	1
the	1
odds	1
of	1
knowledge	1
in	1
my	1
power	1
Without	1
copartner?	1
so	1
to	1
add	1
what	1
wants	1
In	1
female	1
sex,	1
the	1
more	1
to	1
draw	1
his	1
love,	1
And	1
render	1
me	1
more	1
equal;	1
and	1
perhaps,	1
A	1
thing	1
not	1
undesirable,	1
sometime	1
Superiour;	1
for,	1
inferiour,	1
who	1
is	1
free	1
This	1
may	1
be	1
well:	1
But	1
what	1
if	1
God	1
have	1
seen,	1
And	1
death	1
ensue?	1
then	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
more!	1
And	1
Adam,	1
wedded	1
to	1
another	1
Eve,	1
Shall	1
live	1
with	1
her	1
enjoying,	1
I	1
extinct;	1
A	1
death	1
to	1
think!	1
Confirmed	1
then	1
I	1
resolve,	1
Adam	1
shall	1
share	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
bliss	1
or	1
woe:	1
So	1
dear	1
I	1
love	1
him,	1
that	1
with	1
him	1
all	1
deaths	1
I	1
could	1
endure,	1
without	1
him	1
live	1
no	1
life.	1
So	1
saying,	1
from	1
the	1
tree	1
her	1
step	1
she	1
turned;	1
But	1
first	1
low	1
reverence	1
done,	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
Power	1
That	1
dwelt	1
within,	1
whose	1
presence	1
had	1
infused	1
Into	1
the	1
plant	1
sciential	1
sap,	1
derived	1
From	1
nectar,	1
drink	1
of	1
Gods.	1
Adam	1
the	1
while,	1
Waiting	1
desirous	1
her	1
return,	1
had	1
wove	1
Of	1
choicest	1
flowers	1
a	1
garland,	1
to	1
adorn	1
Her	1
tresses,	1
and	1
her	1
rural	1
labours	1
crown;	1
As	1
reapers	1
oft	1
are	1
wont	1
their	1
harvest-queen.	1
Great	1
joy	1
he	1
promised	1
to	1
his	1
thoughts,	1
and	1
new	1
Solace	1
in	1
her	1
return,	1
so	1
long	1
delayed:	1
Yet	1
oft	1
his	1
heart,	1
divine	1
of	1
something	1
ill,	1
Misgave	1
him;	1
he	1
the	1
faltering	1
measure	1
felt;	1
And	1
forth	1
to	1
meet	1
her	1
went,	1
the	1
way	1
she	1
took	1
That	1
morn	1
when	1
first	1
they	1
parted:	1
by	1
the	1
tree	1
Of	1
knowledge	1
he	1
must	1
pass;	1
there	1
he	1
her	1
met,	1
Scarce	1
from	1
the	1
tree	1
returning;	1
in	1
her	1
hand	1
A	1
bough	1
of	1
fairest	1
fruit,	1
that	1
downy	1
smiled,	1
New	1
gathered,	1
and	1
ambrosial	1
smell	1
diffused.	1
To	1
him	1
she	1
hasted;	1
in	1
her	1
face	1
excuse	1
Came	1
prologue,	1
and	1
apology	1
too	1
prompt;	1
Which,	1
with	1
bland	1
words	1
at	1
will,	1
she	1
thus	1
addressed.	1
Hast	1
thou	1
not	1
wondered,	1
Adam,	1
at	1
my	1
stay?	1
Thee	1
I	1
have	1
missed,	1
and	1
thought	1
it	1
long,	1
deprived	1
Thy	1
presence;	1
agony	1
of	1
love	1
till	1
now	1
Not	1
felt,	1
nor	1
shall	1
be	1
twice;	1
for	1
never	1
more	1
Mean	1
I	1
to	1
try,	1
what	1
rash	1
untried	1
I	1
sought,	1
The	1
pain	1
of	1
absence	1
from	1
thy	1
sight.	1
But	1
strange	1
Hath	1
been	1
the	1
cause,	1
and	1
wonderful	1
to	1
hear:	1
This	1
tree	1
is	1
not,	1
as	1
we	1
are	1
told,	1
a	1
tree	1
Of	1
danger	1
tasted,	1
nor	1
to	1
evil	1
unknown	1
Opening	1
the	1
way,	1
but	1
of	1
divine	1
effect	1
To	1
open	1
eyes,	1
and	1
make	1
them	1
Gods	1
who	1
taste;	1
And	1
hath	1
been	1
tasted	1
such:	1
The	1
serpent	1
wise,	1
Or	1
not	1
restrained	1
as	1
we,	1
or	1
not	1
obeying,	1
Hath	1
eaten	1
of	1
the	1
fruit;	1
and	1
is	1
become,	1
Not	1
dead,	1
as	1
we	1
are	1
threatened,	1
but	1
thenceforth	1
Endued	1
with	1
human	1
voice	1
and	1
human	1
sense,	1
Reasoning	1
to	1
admiration;	1
and	1
with	1
me	1
Persuasively	1
hath	1
so	1
prevailed,	1
that	1
I	1
Have	1
also	1
tasted,	1
and	1
have	1
also	1
found	1
The	1
effects	1
to	1
correspond;	1
opener	1
mine	1
eyes,	1
Dim	1
erst,	1
dilated	1
spirits,	1
ampler	1
heart,	1
And	1
growing	1
up	1
to	1
Godhead;	1
which	1
for	1
thee	1
Chiefly	1
I	1
sought,	1
without	1
thee	1
can	1
despise.	1
For	1
bliss,	1
as	1
thou	1
hast	1
part,	1
to	1
me	1
is	1
bliss;	1
Tedious,	1
unshared	1
with	1
thee,	1
and	1
odious	1
soon.	1
Thou	1
therefore	1
also	1
taste,	1
that	1
equal	1
lot	1
May	1
join	1
us,	1
equal	1
joy,	1
as	1
equal	1
love;	1
Lest,	1
thou	1
not	1
tasting,	1
different	1
degree	1
Disjoin	1
us,	1
and	1
I	1
then	1
too	1
late	1
renounce	1
Deity	1
for	1
thee,	1
when	1
Fate	1
will	1
not	1
permit.	1
Thus	1
Eve	1
with	1
countenance	1
blithe	1
her	1
story	1
told;	1
But	1
in	1
her	1
cheek	1
distemper	1
flushing	1
glowed.	1
On	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
Adam,	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
heard	1
The	1
fatal	1
trespass	1
done	1
by	1
Eve,	1
amazed,	1
Astonied	1
stood	1
and	1
blank,	1
while	1
horrour	1
chill	1
Ran	1
through	1
his	1
veins,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
joints	1
relaxed;	1
From	1
his	1
slack	1
hand	1
the	1
garland	1
wreathed	1
for	1
Eve	1
Down	1
dropt,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
faded	1
roses	1
shed:	1
Speechless	1
he	1
stood	1
and	1
pale,	1
till	1
thus	1
at	1
length	1
First	1
to	1
himself	1
he	1
inward	1
silence	1
broke.	1
O	1
fairest	1
of	1
Creation,	1
last	1
and	1
best	1
Of	1
all	1
God's	1
works,	1
Creature	1
in	1
whom	1
excelled	1
Whatever	1
can	1
to	1
sight	1
or	1
thought	1
be	1
formed,	1
Holy,	1
divine,	1
good,	1
amiable,	1
or	1
sweet!	1
How	1
art	1
thou	1
lost!	1
how	1
on	1
a	1
sudden	1
lost,	1
Defaced,	1
deflowered,	1
and	1
now	1
to	1
death	1
devote!	1
Rather,	1
how	1
hast	1
thou	1
yielded	1
to	1
transgress	1
The	1
strict	1
forbiddance,	1
how	1
to	1
violate	1
The	1
sacred	1
fruit	1
forbidden!	1
Some	1
cursed	1
fraud	1
Of	1
enemy	1
hath	1
beguiled	1
thee,	1
yet	1
unknown,	1
And	1
me	1
with	1
thee	1
hath	1
ruined;	1
for	1
with	1
thee	1
Certain	1
my	1
resolution	1
is	1
to	1
die:	1
How	1
can	1
I	1
live	1
without	1
thee!	1
how	1
forego	1
Thy	1
sweet	1
converse,	1
and	1
love	1
so	1
dearly	1
joined,	1
To	1
live	1
again	1
in	1
these	1
wild	1
woods	1
forlorn!	1
Should	1
God	1
create	1
another	1
Eve,	1
and	1
I	1
Another	1
rib	1
afford,	1
yet	1
loss	1
of	1
thee	1
Would	1
never	1
from	1
my	1
heart:	1
no,	1
no!I	1
feel	1
The	1
link	1
of	1
Nature	1
draw	1
me:	1
flesh	1
of	1
flesh,	1
Bone	1
of	1
my	1
bone	1
thou	1
art,	1
and	1
from	1
thy	1
state	1
Mine	1
never	1
shall	1
be	1
parted,	1
bliss	1
or	1
woe.	1
So	1
having	1
said,	1
as	1
one	1
from	1
sad	1
dismay	1
Recomforted,	1
and	1
after	1
thoughts	1
disturbed	1
Submitting	1
to	1
what	1
seemed	1
remediless,	1
Thus	1
in	1
calm	1
mood	1
his	1
words	1
to	1
Eve	1
he	1
turned.	1
Bold	1
deed	1
thou	1
hast	1
presumed,	1
adventurous	1
Eve,	1
And	1
peril	1
great	1
provoked,	1
who	1
thus	1
hast	1
dared,	1
Had	1
it	1
been	1
only	1
coveting	1
to	1
eye	1
That	1
sacred	1
fruit,	1
sacred	1
to	1
abstinence,	1
Much	1
more	1
to	1
taste	1
it	1
under	1
ban	1
to	1
touch.	1
But	1
past	1
who	1
can	1
recall,	1
or	1
done	1
undo?	1
Not	1
God	1
Omnipotent,	1
nor	1
Fate;	1
yet	1
so	1
Perhaps	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
die,	1
perhaps	1
the	1
fact	1
Is	1
not	1
so	1
heinous	1
now,	1
foretasted	1
fruit,	1
Profaned	1
first	1
by	1
the	1
serpent,	1
by	1
him	1
first	1
Made	1
common,	1
and	1
unhallowed,	1
ere	1
our	1
taste;	1
Nor	1
yet	1
on	1
him	1
found	1
deadly;	1
yet	1
he	1
lives;	1
Lives,	1
as	1
thou	1
saidst,	1
and	1
gains	1
to	1
live,	1
as	1
Man,	1
Higher	1
degree	1
of	1
life;	1
inducement	1
strong	1
To	1
us,	1
as	1
likely	1
tasting	1
to	1
attain	1
Proportional	1
ascent;	1
which	1
cannot	1
be	1
But	1
to	1
be	1
Gods,	1
or	1
Angels,	1
demi-Gods.	1
Nor	1
can	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
God,	1
Creator	1
wise,	1
Though	1
threatening,	1
will	1
in	1
earnest	1
so	1
destroy	1
Us	1
his	1
prime	1
creatures,	1
dignified	1
so	1
high,	1
Set	1
over	1
all	1
his	1
works;	1
which	1
in	1
our	1
fall,	1
For	1
us	1
created,	1
needs	1
with	1
us	1
must	1
fail,	1
Dependant	1
made;	1
so	1
God	1
shall	1
uncreate,	1
Be	1
frustrate,	1
do,	1
undo,	1
and	1
labour	1
lose;	1
Not	1
well	1
conceived	1
of	1
God,	1
who,	1
though	1
his	1
power	1
Creation	1
could	1
repeat,	1
yet	1
would	1
be	1
loth	1
Us	1
to	1
abolish,	1
lest	1
the	1
Adversary	1
Triumph,	1
and	1
say;	1
"Fickle	1
their	1
state	1
whom	1
God	1
"Most	1
favours;	1
who	1
can	1
please	1
him	1
long?	1
Me	1
first	1
"He	1
ruined,	1
now	1
Mankind;	1
whom	1
will	1
he	1
next?"	1
Matter	1
of	1
scorn,	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
given	1
the	1
Foe.	1
However	1
I	1
with	1
thee	1
have	1
fixed	1
my	1
lot,	1
Certain	1
to	1
undergo	1
like	1
doom:	1
If	1
death	1
Consort	1
with	1
thee,	1
death	1
is	1
to	1
me	1
as	1
life;	1
So	1
forcible	1
within	1
my	1
heart	1
I	1
feel	1
The	1
bond	1
of	1
Nature	1
draw	1
me	1
to	1
my	1
own;	1
My	1
own	1
in	1
thee,	1
for	1
what	1
thou	1
art	1
is	1
mine;	1
Our	1
state	1
cannot	1
be	1
severed;	1
we	1
are	1
one,	1
One	1
flesh;	1
to	1
lose	1
thee	1
were	1
to	1
lose	1
myself.	1
So	1
Adam;	1
and	1
thus	1
Eve	1
to	1
him	1
replied.	1
O	1
glorious	1
trial	1
of	1
exceeding	1
love,	1
Illustrious	1
evidence,	1
example	1
high!	1
Engaging	1
me	1
to	1
emulate;	1
but,	1
short	1
Of	1
thy	1
perfection,	1
how	1
shall	1
I	1
attain,	1
Adam,	1
from	1
whose	1
dear	1
side	1
I	1
boast	1
me	1
sprung,	1
And	1
gladly	1
of	1
our	1
union	1
hear	1
thee	1
speak,	1
One	1
heart,	1
one	1
soul	1
in	1
both;	1
whereof	1
good	1
proof	1
This	1
day	1
affords,	1
declaring	1
thee	1
resolved,	1
Rather	1
than	1
death,	1
or	1
aught	1
than	1
death	1
more	1
dread,	1
Shall	1
separate	1
us,	1
linked	1
in	1
love	1
so	1
dear,	1
To	1
undergo	1
with	1
me	1
one	1
guilt,	1
one	1
crime,	1
If	1
any	1
be,	1
of	1
tasting	1
this	1
fair	1
fruit;	1
Whose	1
virtue	1
for	1
of	1
good	1
still	1
good	1
proceeds,	1
Direct,	1
or	1
by	1
occasion,	1
hath	1
presented	1
This	1
happy	1
trial	1
of	1
thy	1
love,	1
which	1
else	1
So	1
eminently	1
never	1
had	1
been	1
known?	1
Were	1
it	1
I	1
thought	1
death	1
menaced	1
would	1
ensue	1
This	1
my	1
attempt,	1
I	1
would	1
sustain	1
alone	1
The	1
worst,	1
and	1
not	1
persuade	1
thee,	1
rather	1
die	1
Deserted,	1
than	1
oblige	1
thee	1
with	1
a	1
fact	1
Pernicious	1
to	1
thy	1
peace;	1
chiefly	1
assured	1
Remarkably	1
so	1
late	1
of	1
thy	1
so	1
true,	1
So	1
faithful,	1
love	1
unequalled:	1
but	1
I	1
feel	1
Far	1
otherwise	1
the	1
event;	1
not	1
death,	1
but	1
life	1
Augmented,	1
opened	1
eyes,	1
new	1
hopes,	1
new	1
joys,	1
Taste	1
so	1
divine,	1
that	1
what	1
of	1
sweet	1
before	1
Hath	1
touched	1
my	1
sense,	1
flat	1
seems	1
to	1
this,	1
and	1
harsh.	1
On	1
my	1
experience,	1
Adam,	1
freely	1
taste,	1
And	1
fear	1
of	1
death	1
deliver	1
to	1
the	1
winds.	1
So	1
saying,	1
she	1
embraced	1
him,	1
and	1
for	1
joy	1
Tenderly	1
wept;	1
much	1
won,	1
that	1
he	1
his	1
love	1
Had	1
so	1
ennobled,	1
as	1
of	1
choice	1
to	1
incur	1
Divine	1
displeasure	1
for	1
her	1
sake,	1
or	1
death.	1
In	1
recompence	1
for	1
such	1
compliance	1
bad	1
Such	1
recompence	1
best	1
merits	1
from	1
the	1
bough	1
She	1
gave	1
him	1
of	1
that	1
fair	1
enticing	1
fruit	1
With	1
liberal	1
hand:	1
he	1
scrupled	1
not	1
to	1
eat,	1
Against	1
his	1
better	1
knowledge;	1
not	1
deceived,	1
But	1
fondly	1
overcome	1
with	1
female	1
charm.	1
Earth	1
trembled	1
from	1
her	1
entrails,	1
as	1
again	1
In	1
pangs;	1
and	1
Nature	1
gave	1
a	1
second	1
groan;	1
Sky	1
loured;	1
and,	1
muttering	1
thunder,	1
some	1
sad	1
drops	1
Wept	1
at	1
completing	1
of	1
the	1
mortal	1
sin	1
Original:	1
while	1
Adam	1
took	1
no	1
thought,	1
Eating	1
his	1
fill;	1
nor	1
Eve	1
to	1
iterate	1
Her	1
former	1
trespass	1
feared,	1
the	1
more	1
to	1
sooth	1
Him	1
with	1
her	1
loved	1
society;	1
that	1
now,	1
As	1
with	1
new	1
wine	1
intoxicated	1
both,	1
They	1
swim	1
in	1
mirth,	1
and	1
fancy	1
that	1
they	1
feel	1
Divinity	1
within	1
them	1
breeding	1
wings,	1
Wherewith	1
to	1
scorn	1
the	1
earth:	1
But	1
that	1
false	1
fruit	1
Far	1
other	1
operation	1
first	1
displayed,	1
Carnal	1
desire	1
inflaming;	1
he	1
on	1
Eve	1
Began	1
to	1
cast	1
lascivious	1
eyes;	1
she	1
him	1
As	1
wantonly	1
repaid;	1
in	1
lust	1
they	1
burn:	1
Till	1
Adam	1
thus	1
'gan	1
Eve	1
to	1
dalliance	1
move.	1
Eve,	1
now	1
I	1
see	1
thou	1
art	1
exact	1
of	1
taste,	1
And	1
elegant,	1
of	1
sapience	1
no	1
small	1
part;	1
Since	1
to	1
each	1
meaning	1
savour	1
we	1
apply,	1
And	1
palate	1
call	1
judicious;	1
I	1
the	1
praise	1
Yield	1
thee,	1
so	1
well	1
this	1
day	1
thou	1
hast	1
purveyed.	1
Much	1
pleasure	1
we	1
have	1
lost,	1
while	1
we	1
abstained	1
From	1
this	1
delightful	1
fruit,	1
nor	1
known	1
till	1
now	1
True	1
relish,	1
tasting;	1
if	1
such	1
pleasure	1
be	1
In	1
things	1
to	1
us	1
forbidden,	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
wished,	1
For	1
this	1
one	1
tree	1
had	1
been	1
forbidden	1
ten.	1
But	1
come,	1
so	1
well	1
refreshed,	1
now	1
let	1
us	1
play,	1
As	1
meet	1
is,	1
after	1
such	1
delicious	1
fare;	1
For	1
never	1
did	1
thy	1
beauty,	1
since	1
the	1
day	1
I	1
saw	1
thee	1
first	1
and	1
wedded	1
thee,	1
adorned	1
With	1
all	1
perfections,	1
so	1
inflame	1
my	1
sense	1
With	1
ardour	1
to	1
enjoy	1
thee,	1
fairer	1
now	1
Than	1
ever;	1
bounty	1
of	1
this	1
virtuous	1
tree!	1
So	1
said	1
he,	1
and	1
forbore	1
not	1
glance	1
or	1
toy	1
Of	1
amorous	1
intent;	1
well	1
understood	1
Of	1
Eve,	1
whose	1
eye	1
darted	1
contagious	1
fire.	1
Her	1
hand	1
he	1
seised;	1
and	1
to	1
a	1
shady	1
bank,	1
Thick	1
over-head	1
with	1
verdant	1
roof	1
imbowered,	1
He	1
led	1
her	1
nothing	1
loth;	1
flowers	1
were	1
the	1
couch,	1
Pansies,	1
and	1
violets,	1
and	1
asphodel,	1
And	1
hyacinth;	1
Earth's	1
freshest	1
softest	1
lap.	1
There	1
they	1
their	1
fill	1
of	1
love	1
and	1
love's	1
disport	1
Took	1
largely,	1
of	1
their	1
mutual	1
guilt	1
the	1
seal,	1
The	1
solace	1
of	1
their	1
sin;	1
till	1
dewy	1
sleep	1
Oppressed	1
them,	1
wearied	1
with	1
their	1
amorous	1
play,	1
Soon	1
as	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
that	1
fallacious	1
fruit,	1
That	1
with	1
exhilarating	1
vapour	1
bland	1
About	1
their	1
spirits	1
had	1
played,	1
and	1
inmost	1
powers	1
Made	1
err,	1
was	1
now	1
exhaled;	1
and	1
grosser	1
sleep,	1
Bred	1
of	1
unkindly	1
fumes,	1
with	1
conscious	1
dreams	1
Incumbered,	1
now	1
had	1
left	1
them;	1
up	1
they	1
rose	1
As	1
from	1
unrest;	1
and,	1
each	1
the	1
other	1
viewing,	1
Soon	1
found	1
their	1
eyes	1
how	1
opened,	1
and	1
their	1
minds	1
How	1
darkened;	1
innocence,	1
that	1
as	1
a	1
veil	1
Had	1
shadowed	1
them	1
from	1
knowing	1
ill,	1
was	1
gone;	1
Just	1
confidence,	1
and	1
native	1
righteousness,	1
And	1
honour,	1
from	1
about	1
them,	1
naked	1
left	1
To	1
guilty	1
Shame;	1
he	1
covered,	1
but	1
his	1
robe	1
Uncovered	1
more.	1
So	1
rose	1
the	1
Danite	1
strong,	1
Herculean	1
Samson,	1
from	1
the	1
harlot-lap	1
Of	1
Philistean	1
Dalilah,	1
and	1
waked	1
Shorn	1
of	1
his	1
strength.	1
They	1
destitute	1
and	1
bare	1
Of	1
all	1
their	1
virtue:	1
Silent,	1
and	1
in	1
face	1
Confounded,	1
long	1
they	1
sat,	1
as	1
strucken	1
mute:	1
Till	1
Adam,	1
though	1
not	1
less	1
than	1
Eve	1
abashed,	1
At	1
length	1
gave	1
utterance	1
to	1
these	1
words	1
constrained.	1
O	1
Eve,	1
in	1
evil	1
hour	1
thou	1
didst	1
give	1
ear	1
To	1
that	1
false	1
worm,	1
of	1
whomsoever	1
taught	1
To	1
counterfeit	1
Man's	1
voice;	1
true	1
in	1
our	1
fall,	1
False	1
in	1
our	1
promised	1
rising;	1
since	1
our	1
eyes	1
Opened	1
we	1
find	1
indeed,	1
and	1
find	1
we	1
know	1
Both	1
good	1
and	1
evil;	1
good	1
lost,	1
and	1
evil	1
got;	1
Bad	1
fruit	1
of	1
knowledge,	1
if	1
this	1
be	1
to	1
know;	1
Which	1
leaves	1
us	1
naked	1
thus,	1
of	1
honour	1
void,	1
Of	1
innocence,	1
of	1
faith,	1
of	1
purity,	1
Our	1
wonted	1
ornaments	1
now	1
soiled	1
and	1
stained,	1
And	1
in	1
our	1
faces	1
evident	1
the	1
signs	1
Of	1
foul	1
concupiscence;	1
whence	1
evil	1
store;	1
Even	1
shame,	1
the	1
last	1
of	1
evils;	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
Be	1
sure	1
then.--How	1
shall	1
I	1
behold	1
the	1
face	1
Henceforth	1
of	1
God	1
or	1
Angel,	1
erst	1
with	1
joy	1
And	1
rapture	1
so	1
oft	1
beheld?	1
Those	1
heavenly	1
shapes	1
Will	1
dazzle	1
now	1
this	1
earthly	1
with	1
their	1
blaze	1
Insufferably	1
bright.	1
O!	1
might	1
I	1
here	1
In	1
solitude	1
live	1
savage;	1
in	1
some	1
glade	1
Obscured,	1
where	1
highest	1
woods,	1
impenetrable	1
To	1
star	1
or	1
sun-light,	1
spread	1
their	1
umbrage	1
broad	1
And	1
brown	1
as	1
evening:	1
Cover	1
me,	1
ye	1
Pines!	1
Ye	1
Cedars,	1
with	1
innumerable	1
boughs	1
Hide	1
me,	1
where	1
I	1
may	1
never	1
see	1
them	1
more!--	1
But	1
let	1
us	1
now,	1
as	1
in	1
bad	1
plight,	1
devise	1
What	1
best	1
may	1
for	1
the	1
present	1
serve	1
to	1
hide	1
The	1
parts	1
of	1
each	1
from	1
other,	1
that	1
seem	1
most	1
To	1
shame	1
obnoxious,	1
and	1
unseemliest	1
seen;	1
Some	1
tree,	1
whose	1
broad	1
smooth	1
leaves	1
together	1
sewed,	1
And	1
girded	1
on	1
our	1
loins,	1
may	1
cover	1
round	1
Those	1
middle	1
parts;	1
that	1
this	1
new	1
comer,	1
Shame,	1
There	1
sit	1
not,	1
and	1
reproach	1
us	1
as	1
unclean.	1
So	1
counselled	1
he,	1
and	1
both	1
together	1
went	1
Into	1
the	1
thickest	1
wood;	1
there	1
soon	1
they	1
chose	1
The	1
fig-tree;	1
not	1
that	1
kind	1
for	1
fruit	1
renowned,	1
But	1
such	1
as	1
at	1
this	1
day,	1
to	1
Indians	1
known,	1
In	1
Malabar	1
or	1
Decan	1
spreads	1
her	1
arms	1
Branching	1
so	1
broad	1
and	1
long,	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
ground	1
The	1
bended	1
twigs	1
take	1
root,	1
and	1
daughters	1
grow	1
About	1
the	1
mother	1
tree,	1
a	1
pillared	1
shade	1
High	1
over-arched,	1
and	1
echoing	1
walks	1
between:	1
There	1
oft	1
the	1
Indian	1
herdsman,	1
shunning	1
heat,	1
Shelters	1
in	1
cool,	1
and	1
tends	1
his	1
pasturing	1
herds	1
At	1
loop-holes	1
cut	1
through	1
thickest	1
shade:	1
Those	1
leaves	1
They	1
gathered,	1
broad	1
as	1
Amazonian	1
targe;	1
And,	1
with	1
what	1
skill	1
they	1
had,	1
together	1
sewed,	1
To	1
gird	1
their	1
waist;	1
vain	1
covering,	1
if	1
to	1
hide	1
Their	1
guilt	1
and	1
dreaded	1
shame!	1
O,	1
how	1
unlike	1
To	1
that	1
first	1
naked	1
glory!	1
Such	1
of	1
late	1
Columbus	1
found	1
the	1
American,	1
so	1
girt	1
With	1
feathered	1
cincture;	1
naked	1
else,	1
and	1
wild	1
Among	1
the	1
trees	1
on	1
isles	1
and	1
woody	1
shores.	1
Thus	1
fenced,	1
and,	1
as	1
they	1
thought,	1
their	1
shame	1
in	1
part	1
Covered,	1
but	1
not	1
at	1
rest	1
or	1
ease	1
of	1
mind,	1
They	1
sat	1
them	1
down	1
to	1
weep;	1
nor	1
only	1
tears	1
Rained	1
at	1
their	1
eyes,	1
but	1
high	1
winds	1
worse	1
within	1
Began	1
to	1
rise,	1
high	1
passions,	1
anger,	1
hate,	1
Mistrust,	1
suspicion,	1
discord;	1
and	1
shook	1
sore	1
Their	1
inward	1
state	1
of	1
mind,	1
calm	1
region	1
once	1
And	1
full	1
of	1
peace,	1
now	1
tost	1
and	1
turbulent:	1
For	1
Understanding	1
ruled	1
not,	1
and	1
the	1
Will	1
Heard	1
not	1
her	1
lore;	1
both	1
in	1
subjection	1
now	1
To	1
sensual	1
Appetite,	1
who	1
from	1
beneath	1
Usurping	1
over	1
sovran	1
Reason	1
claimed	1
Superiour	1
sway:	1
From	1
thus	1
distempered	1
breast,	1
Adam,	1
estranged	1
in	1
look	1
and	1
altered	1
style,	1
Speech	1
intermitted	1
thus	1
to	1
Eve	1
renewed.	1
Would	1
thou	1
hadst	1
hearkened	1
to	1
my	1
words,	1
and	1
staid	1
With	1
me,	1
as	1
I	1
besought	1
thee,	1
when	1
that	1
strange	1
Desire	1
of	1
wandering,	1
this	1
unhappy	1
morn,	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
whence	1
possessed	1
thee;	1
we	1
had	1
then	1
Remained	1
still	1
happy;	1
not,	1
as	1
now,	1
despoiled	1
Of	1
all	1
our	1
good;	1
shamed,	1
naked,	1
miserable!	1
Let	1
none	1
henceforth	1
seek	1
needless	1
cause	1
to	1
approve	1
The	1
faith	1
they	1
owe;	1
when	1
earnestly	1
they	1
seek	1
Such	1
proof,	1
conclude,	1
they	1
then	1
begin	1
to	1
fail.	1
To	1
whom,	1
soon	1
moved	1
with	1
touch	1
of	1
blame,	1
thus	1
Eve.	1
What	1
words	1
have	1
passed	1
thy	1
lips,	1
Adam	1
severe!	1
Imputest	1
thou	1
that	1
to	1
my	1
default,	1
or	1
will	1
Of	1
wandering,	1
as	1
thou	1
callest	1
it,	1
which	1
who	1
knows	1
But	1
might	1
as	1
ill	1
have	1
happened	1
thou	1
being	1
by,	1
Or	1
to	1
thyself	1
perhaps?	1
Hadst	1
thou	1
been	1
there,	1
Or	1
here	1
the	1
attempt,	1
thou	1
couldst	1
not	1
have	1
discerned	1
Fraud	1
in	1
the	1
Serpent,	1
speaking	1
as	1
he	1
spake;	1
No	1
ground	1
of	1
enmity	1
between	1
us	1
known,	1
Why	1
he	1
should	1
mean	1
me	1
ill,	1
or	1
seek	1
to	1
harm.	1
Was	1
I	1
to	1
have	1
never	1
parted	1
from	1
thy	1
side?	1
As	1
good	1
have	1
grown	1
there	1
still	1
a	1
lifeless	1
rib.	1
Being	1
as	1
I	1
am,	1
why	1
didst	1
not	1
thou,	1
the	1
head,	1
Command	1
me	1
absolutely	1
not	1
to	1
go,	1
Going	1
into	1
such	1
danger,	1
as	1
thou	1
saidst?	1
Too	1
facile	1
then,	1
thou	1
didst	1
not	1
much	1
gainsay;	1
Nay,	1
didst	1
permit,	1
approve,	1
and	1
fair	1
dismiss.	1
Hadst	1
thou	1
been	1
firm	1
and	1
fixed	1
in	1
thy	1
dissent,	1
Neither	1
had	1
I	1
transgressed,	1
nor	1
thou	1
with	1
me.	1
To	1
whom,	1
then	1
first	1
incensed,	1
Adam	1
replied.	1
Is	1
this	1
the	1
love,	1
is	1
this	1
the	1
recompence	1
Of	1
mine	1
to	1
thee,	1
ingrateful	1
Eve!	1
expressed	1
Immutable,	1
when	1
thou	1
wert	1
lost,	1
not	1
I;	1
Who	1
might	1
have	1
lived,	1
and	1
joyed	1
immortal	1
bliss,	1
Yet	1
willingly	1
chose	1
rather	1
death	1
with	1
thee?	1
And	1
am	1
I	1
now	1
upbraided	1
as	1
the	1
cause	1
Of	1
thy	1
transgressing?	1
Not	1
enough	1
severe,	1
It	1
seems,	1
in	1
thy	1
restraint:	1
What	1
could	1
I	1
more	1
I	1
warned	1
thee,	1
I	1
admonished	1
thee,	1
foretold	1
The	1
danger,	1
and	1
the	1
lurking	1
enemy	1
That	1
lay	1
in	1
wait;	1
beyond	1
this,	1
had	1
been	1
force;	1
And	1
force	1
upon	1
free	1
will	1
hath	1
here	1
no	1
place.	1
But	1
confidence	1
then	1
bore	1
thee	1
on;	1
secure	1
Either	1
to	1
meet	1
no	1
danger,	1
or	1
to	1
find	1
Matter	1
of	1
glorious	1
trial;	1
and	1
perhaps	1
I	1
also	1
erred,	1
in	1
overmuch	1
admiring	1
What	1
seemed	1
in	1
thee	1
so	1
perfect,	1
that	1
I	1
thought	1
No	1
evil	1
durst	1
attempt	1
thee;	1
but	1
I	1
rue	1
The	1
errour	1
now,	1
which	1
is	1
become	1
my	1
crime,	1
And	1
thou	1
the	1
accuser.	1
Thus	1
it	1
shall	1
befall	1
Him,	1
who,	1
to	1
worth	1
in	1
women	1
overtrusting,	1
Lets	1
her	1
will	1
rule:	1
restraint	1
she	1
will	1
not	1
brook;	1
And,	1
left	1
to	1
herself,	1
if	1
evil	1
thence	1
ensue,	1
She	1
first	1
his	1
weak	1
indulgence	1
will	1
accuse.	1
Thus	1
they	1
in	1
mutual	1
accusation	1
spent	1
The	1
fruitless	1
hours,	1
but	1
neither	1
self-condemning;	1
And	1
of	1
their	1
vain	1
contest	1
appeared	1
no	1
end.	1
Book	1
X	1
Mean	1
while	1
the	1
heinous	1
and	1
despiteful	1
act	1
Of	1
Satan,	1
done	1
in	1
Paradise;	1
and	1
how	1
He,	1
in	1
the	1
serpent,	1
had	1
perverted	1
Eve,	1
Her	1
husband	1
she,	1
to	1
taste	1
the	1
fatal	1
fruit,	1
Was	1
known	1
in	1
Heaven;	1
for	1
what	1
can	1
'scape	1
the	1
eye	1
Of	1
God	1
all-seeing,	1
or	1
deceive	1
his	1
heart	1
Omniscient?	1
who,	1
in	1
all	1
things	1
wise	1
and	1
just,	1
Hindered	1
not	1
Satan	1
to	1
attempt	1
the	1
mind	1
Of	1
Man,	1
with	1
strength	1
entire	1
and	1
free	1
will	1
armed,	1
Complete	1
to	1
have	1
discovered	1
and	1
repulsed	1
Whatever	1
wiles	1
of	1
foe	1
or	1
seeming	1
friend.	1
For	1
still	1
they	1
knew,	1
and	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
still	1
remembered,	1
The	1
high	1
injunction,	1
not	1
to	1
taste	1
that	1
fruit,	1
Whoever	1
tempted;	1
which	1
they	1
not	1
obeying,	1
(Incurred	1
what	1
could	1
they	1
less?)	1
the	1
penalty;	1
And,	1
manifold	1
in	1
sin,	1
deserved	1
to	1
fall.	1
Up	1
into	1
Heaven	1
from	1
Paradise	1
in	1
haste	1
The	1
angelick	1
guards	1
ascended,	1
mute,	1
and	1
sad,	1
For	1
Man;	1
for	1
of	1
his	1
state	1
by	1
this	1
they	1
knew,	1
Much	1
wondering	1
how	1
the	1
subtle	1
Fiend	1
had	1
stolen	1
Entrance	1
unseen.	1
Soon	1
as	1
the	1
unwelcome	1
news	1
From	1
Earth	1
arrived	1
at	1
Heaven-gate,	1
displeased	1
All	1
were	1
who	1
heard;	1
dim	1
sadness	1
did	1
not	1
spare	1
That	1
time	1
celestial	1
visages,	1
yet,	1
mixed	1
With	1
pity,	1
violated	1
not	1
their	1
bliss.	1
About	1
the	1
new-arrived,	1
in	1
multitudes	1
The	1
ethereal	1
people	1
ran,	1
to	1
hear	1
and	1
know	1
How	1
all	1
befel:	1
They	1
towards	1
the	1
throne	1
supreme,	1
Accountable,	1
made	1
haste,	1
to	1
make	1
appear,	1
With	1
righteous	1
plea,	1
their	1
utmost	1
vigilance	1
And	1
easily	1
approved;	1
when	1
the	1
Most	1
High	1
Eternal	1
Father,	1
from	1
his	1
secret	1
cloud,	1
Amidst	1
in	1
thunder	1
uttered	1
thus	1
his	1
voice.	1
Assembled	1
Angels,	1
and	1
ye	1
Powers	1
returned	1
From	1
unsuccessful	1
charge;	1
be	1
not	1
dismayed,	1
Nor	1
troubled	1
at	1
these	1
tidings	1
from	1
the	1
earth,	1
Which	1
your	1
sincerest	1
care	1
could	1
not	1
prevent;	1
Foretold	1
so	1
lately	1
what	1
would	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
When	1
first	1
this	1
tempter	1
crossed	1
the	1
gulf	1
from	1
Hell.	1
I	1
told	1
ye	1
then	1
he	1
should	1
prevail,	1
and	1
speed	1
On	1
his	1
bad	1
errand;	1
Man	1
should	1
be	1
seduced,	1
And	1
flattered	1
out	1
of	1
all,	1
believing	1
lies	1
Against	1
his	1
Maker;	1
no	1
decree	1
of	1
mine	1
Concurring	1
to	1
necessitate	1
his	1
fall,	1
Or	1
touch	1
with	1
lightest	1
moment	1
of	1
impulse	1
His	1
free	1
will,	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
inclining	1
left	1
In	1
even	1
scale.	1
But	1
fallen	1
he	1
is;	1
and	1
now	1
What	1
rests,	1
but	1
that	1
the	1
mortal	1
sentence	1
pass	1
On	1
his	1
transgression,--death	1
denounced	1
that	1
day?	1
Which	1
he	1
presumes	1
already	1
vain	1
and	1
void,	1
Because	1
not	1
yet	1
inflicted,	1
as	1
he	1
feared,	1
By	1
some	1
immediate	1
stroke;	1
but	1
soon	1
shall	1
find	1
Forbearance	1
no	1
acquittance,	1
ere	1
day	1
end.	1
Justice	1
shall	1
not	1
return	1
as	1
bounty	1
scorned.	1
But	1
whom	1
send	1
I	1
to	1
judge	1
them?	1
whom	1
but	1
thee,	1
Vicegerent	1
Son?	1
To	1
thee	1
I	1
have	1
transferred	1
All	1
judgement,	1
whether	1
in	1
Heaven,	1
or	1
Earth,	1
or	1
Hell.	1
Easy	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
seen	1
that	1
I	1
intend	1
Mercy	1
colleague	1
with	1
justice,	1
sending	1
thee	1
Man's	1
friend,	1
his	1
Mediator,	1
his	1
designed	1
Both	1
ransom	1
and	1
Redeemer	1
voluntary,	1
And	1
destined	1
Man	1
himself	1
to	1
judge	1
Man	1
fallen.	1
So	1
spake	1
the	1
Father;	1
and,	1
unfolding	1
bright	1
Toward	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
his	1
glory,	1
on	1
the	1
Son	1
Blazed	1
forth	1
unclouded	1
Deity:	1
He	1
full	1
Resplendent	1
all	1
his	1
Father	1
manifest	1
Expressed,	1
and	1
thus	1
divinely	1
answered	1
mild.	1
Father	1
Eternal,	1
thine	1
is	1
to	1
decree;	1
Mine,	1
both	1
in	1
Heaven	1
and	1
Earth,	1
to	1
do	1
thy	1
will	1
Supreme;	1
that	1
thou	1
in	1
me,	1
thy	1
Son	1
beloved,	1
Mayest	1
ever	1
rest	1
well	1
pleased.	1
I	1
go	1
to	1
judge	1
On	1
earth	1
these	1
thy	1
transgressours;	1
but	1
thou	1
knowest,	1
Whoever	1
judged,	1
the	1
worst	1
on	1
me	1
must	1
light,	1
When	1
time	1
shall	1
be;	1
for	1
so	1
I	1
undertook	1
Before	1
thee;	1
and,	1
not	1
repenting,	1
this	1
obtain	1
Of	1
right,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
mitigate	1
their	1
doom	1
On	1
me	1
derived;	1
yet	1
I	1
shall	1
temper	1
so	1
Justice	1
with	1
mercy,	1
as	1
may	1
illustrate	1
most	1
Them	1
fully	1
satisfied,	1
and	1
thee	1
appease.	1
Attendance	1
none	1
shall	1
need,	1
nor	1
train,	1
where	1
none	1
Are	1
to	1
behold	1
the	1
judgement,	1
but	1
the	1
judged,	1
Those	1
two;	1
the	1
third	1
best	1
absent	1
is	1
condemned,	1
Convict	1
by	1
flight,	1
and	1
rebel	1
to	1
all	1
law:	1
Conviction	1
to	1
the	1
serpent	1
none	1
belongs.	1
Thus	1
saying,	1
from	1
his	1
radiant	1
seat	1
he	1
rose	1
Of	1
high	1
collateral	1
glory:	1
Him	1
Thrones,	1
and	1
Powers,	1
Princedoms,	1
and	1
Dominations	1
ministrant,	1
Accompanied	1
to	1
Heaven-gate;	1
from	1
whence	1
Eden,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
coast,	1
in	1
prospect	1
lay.	1
Down	1
he	1
descended	1
straight;	1
the	1
speed	1
of	1
Gods	1
Time	1
counts	1
not,	1
though	1
with	1
swiftest	1
minutes	1
winged.	1
Now	1
was	1
the	1
sun	1
in	1
western	1
cadence	1
low	1
From	1
noon,	1
and	1
gentle	1
airs,	1
due	1
at	1
their	1
hour,	1
To	1
fan	1
the	1
earth	1
now	1
waked,	1
and	1
usher	1
in	1
The	1
evening	1
cool;	1
when	1
he,	1
from	1
wrath	1
more	1
cool,	1
Came	1
the	1
mild	1
Judge,	1
and	1
Intercessour	1
both,	1
To	1
sentence	1
Man:	1
The	1
voice	1
of	1
God	1
they	1
heard	1
Now	1
walking	1
in	1
the	1
garden,	1
by	1
soft	1
winds	1
Brought	1
to	1
their	1
ears,	1
while	1
day	1
declined;	1
they	1
heard,	1
And	1
from	1
his	1
presence	1
hid	1
themselves	1
among	1
The	1
thickest	1
trees,	1
both	1
man	1
and	1
wife;	1
till	1
God,	1
Approaching,	1
thus	1
to	1
Adam	1
called	1
aloud.	1
Where	1
art	1
thou,	1
Adam,	1
wont	1
with	1
joy	1
to	1
meet	1
My	1
coming	1
seen	1
far	1
off?	1
I	1
miss	1
thee	1
here,	1
Not	1
pleased,	1
thus	1
entertained	1
with	1
solitude,	1
Where	1
obvious	1
duty	1
ere	1
while	1
appeared	1
unsought:	1
Or	1
come	1
I	1
less	1
conspicuous,	1
or	1
what	1
change	1
Absents	1
thee,	1
or	1
what	1
chance	1
detains?--Come	1
forth!	1
He	1
came;	1
and	1
with	1
him	1
Eve,	1
more	1
loth,	1
though	1
first	1
To	1
offend;	1
discountenanced	1
both,	1
and	1
discomposed;	1
Love	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
their	1
looks,	1
either	1
to	1
God,	1
Or	1
to	1
each	1
other;	1
but	1
apparent	1
guilt,	1
And	1
shame,	1
and	1
perturbation,	1
and	1
despair,	1
Anger,	1
and	1
obstinacy,	1
and	1
hate,	1
and	1
guile.	1
Whence	1
Adam,	1
faltering	1
long,	1
thus	1
answered	1
brief.	1
I	1
heard	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
garden,	1
and	1
of	1
thy	1
voice	1
Afraid,	1
being	1
naked,	1
hid	1
myself.	1
To	1
whom	1
The	1
gracious	1
Judge	1
without	1
revile	1
replied.	1
My	1
voice	1
thou	1
oft	1
hast	1
heard,	1
and	1
hast	1
not	1
feared,	1
But	1
still	1
rejoiced;	1
how	1
is	1
it	1
now	1
become	1
So	1
dreadful	1
to	1
thee?	1
That	1
thou	1
art	1
naked,	1
who	1
Hath	1
told	1
thee?	1
Hast	1
thou	1
eaten	1
of	1
the	1
tree,	1
Whereof	1
I	1
gave	1
thee	1
charge	1
thou	1
shouldst	1
not	1
eat?	1
To	1
whom	1
thus	1
Adam	1
sore	1
beset	1
replied.	1
O	1
Heaven!	1
in	1
evil	1
strait	1
this	1
day	1
I	1
stand	1
Before	1
my	1
Judge;	1
either	1
to	1
undergo	1
Myself	1
the	1
total	1
crime,	1
or	1
to	1
accuse	1
My	1
other	1
self,	1
the	1
partner	1
of	1
my	1
life;	1
Whose	1
failing,	1
while	1
her	1
faith	1
to	1
me	1
remains,	1
I	1
should	1
conceal,	1
and	1
not	1
expose	1
to	1
blame	1
By	1
my	1
complaint:	1
but	1
strict	1
necessity	1
Subdues	1
me,	1
and	1
calamitous	1
constraint;	1
Lest	1
on	1
my	1
head	1
both	1
sin	1
and	1
punishment,	1
However	1
insupportable,	1
be	1
all	1
Devolved;	1
though	1
should	1
I	1
hold	1
my	1
peace,	1
yet	1
thou	1
Wouldst	1
easily	1
detect	1
what	1
I	1
conceal.--	1
This	1
Woman,	1
whom	1
thou	1
madest	1
to	1
be	1
my	1
help,	1
And	1
gavest	1
me	1
as	1
thy	1
perfect	1
gift,	1
so	1
good,	1
So	1
fit,	1
so	1
acceptable,	1
so	1
divine,	1
That	1
from	1
her	1
hand	1
I	1
could	1
suspect	1
no	1
ill,	1
And	1
what	1
she	1
did,	1
whatever	1
in	1
itself,	1
Her	1
doing	1
seemed	1
to	1
justify	1
the	1
deed;	1
She	1
gave	1
me	1
of	1
the	1
tree,	1
and	1
I	1
did	1
eat.	1
To	1
whom	1
the	1
Sovran	1
Presence	1
thus	1
replied.	1
Was	1
she	1
thy	1
God,	1
that	1
her	1
thou	1
didst	1
obey	1
Before	1
his	1
voice?	1
or	1
was	1
she	1
made	1
thy	1
guide,	1
Superiour,	1
or	1
but	1
equal,	1
that	1
to	1
her	1
Thou	1
didst	1
resign	1
thy	1
manhood,	1
and	1
the	1
place	1
Wherein	1
God	1
set	1
thee	1
above	1
her	1
made	1
of	1
thee,	1
And	1
for	1
thee,	1
whose	1
perfection	1
far	1
excelled	1
Hers	1
in	1
all	1
real	1
dignity?	1
Adorned	1
She	1
was	1
indeed,	1
and	1
lovely,	1
to	1
attract	1
Thy	1
love,	1
not	1
thy	1
subjection;	1
and	1
her	1
gifts	1
Were	1
such,	1
as	1
under	1
government	1
well	1
seemed;	1
Unseemly	1
to	1
bear	1
rule;	1
which	1
was	1
thy	1
part	1
And	1
person,	1
hadst	1
thou	1
known	1
thyself	1
aright.	1
So	1
having	1
said,	1
he	1
thus	1
to	1
Eve	1
in	1
few.	1
Say,	1
Woman,	1
what	1
is	1
this	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
done?	1
To	1
whom	1
sad	1
Eve,	1
with	1
shame	1
nigh	1
overwhelmed,	1
Confessing	1
soon,	1
yet	1
not	1
before	1
her	1
Judge	1
Bold	1
or	1
loquacious,	1
thus	1
abashed	1
replied.	1
The	1
Serpent	1
me	1
beguiled,	1
and	1
I	1
did	1
eat.	1
Which	1
when	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
heard,	1
without	1
delay	1
To	1
judgement	1
he	1
proceeded	1
on	1
the	1
accused	1
Serpent,	1
though	1
brute;	1
unable	1
to	1
transfer	1
The	1
guilt	1
on	1
him,	1
who	1
made	1
him	1
instrument	1
Of	1
mischief,	1
and	1
polluted	1
from	1
the	1
end	1
Of	1
his	1
creation;	1
justly	1
then	1
accursed,	1
As	1
vitiated	1
in	1
nature:	1
More	1
to	1
know	1
Concerned	1
not	1
Man,	1
(since	1
he	1
no	1
further	1
knew)	1
Nor	1
altered	1
his	1
offence;	1
yet	1
God	1
at	1
last	1
To	1
Satan	1
first	1
in	1
sin	1
his	1
doom	1
applied,	1
Though	1
in	1
mysterious	1
terms,	1
judged	1
as	1
then	1
best:	1
And	1
on	1
the	1
Serpent	1
thus	1
his	1
curse	1
let	1
fall.	1
Because	1
thou	1
hast	1
done	1
this,	1
thou	1
art	1
accursed	1
Above	1
all	1
cattle,	1
each	1
beast	1
of	1
the	1
field;	1
Upon	1
thy	1
belly	1
groveling	1
thou	1
shalt	1
go,	1
And	1
dust	1
shalt	1
eat	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
thy	1
life.	1
Between	1
thee	1
and	1
the	1
woman	1
I	1
will	1
put	1
Enmity,	1
and	1
between	1
thine	1
and	1
her	1
seed;	1
Her	1
seed	1
shall	1
bruise	1
thy	1
head,	1
thou	1
bruise	1
his	1
heel.	1
So	1
spake	1
this	1
oracle,	1
then	1
verified	1
When	1
Jesus,	1
Son	1
of	1
Mary,	1
second	1
Eve,	1
Saw	1
Satan	1
fall,	1
like	1
lightning,	1
down	1
from	1
Heaven,	1
Prince	1
of	1
the	1
air;	1
then,	1
rising	1
from	1
his	1
grave	1
Spoiled	1
Principalities	1
and	1
Powers,	1
triumphed	1
In	1
open	1
show;	1
and,	1
with	1
ascension	1
bright,	1
Captivity	1
led	1
captive	1
through	1
the	1
air,	1
The	1
realm	1
itself	1
of	1
Satan,	1
long	1
usurped;	1
Whom	1
he	1
shall	1
tread	1
at	1
last	1
under	1
our	1
feet;	1
Even	1
he,	1
who	1
now	1
foretold	1
his	1
fatal	1
bruise;	1
And	1
to	1
the	1
Woman	1
thus	1
his	1
sentence	1
turned.	1
Thy	1
sorrow	1
I	1
will	1
greatly	1
multiply	1
By	1
thy	1
conception;	1
children	1
thou	1
shalt	1
bring	1
In	1
sorrow	1
forth;	1
and	1
to	1
thy	1
husband's	1
will	1
Thine	1
shall	1
submit;	1
he	1
over	1
thee	1
shall	1
rule.	1
On	1
Adam	1
last	1
thus	1
judgement	1
he	1
pronounced.	1
Because	1
thou	1
hast	1
hearkened	1
to	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
thy	1
wife,	1
And	1
eaten	1
of	1
the	1
tree,	1
concerning	1
which	1
I	1
charged	1
thee,	1
saying,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
eat	1
thereof:	1
Cursed	1
is	1
the	1
ground	1
for	1
thy	1
sake;	1
thou	1
in	1
sorrow	1
Shalt	1
eat	1
thereof,	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
thy	1
life;	1
Thorns	1
also	1
and	1
thistles	1
it	1
shall	1
bring	1
thee	1
forth	1
Unbid;	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
eat	1
the	1
herb	1
of	1
the	1
field;	1
In	1
the	1
sweat	1
of	1
thy	1
face	1
shalt	1
thou	1
eat	1
bread,	1
Till	1
thou	1
return	1
unto	1
the	1
ground;	1
for	1
thou	1
Out	1
of	1
the	1
ground	1
wast	1
taken,	1
know	1
thy	1
birth,	1
For	1
dust	1
thou	1
art,	1
and	1
shalt	1
to	1
dust	1
return.	1
So	1
judged	1
he	1
Man,	1
both	1
Judge	1
and	1
Saviour	1
sent;	1
And	1
the	1
instant	1
stroke	1
of	1
death,	1
denounced	1
that	1
day,	1
Removed	1
far	1
off;	1
then,	1
pitying	1
how	1
they	1
stood	1
Before	1
him	1
naked	1
to	1
the	1
air,	1
that	1
now	1
Must	1
suffer	1
change,	1
disdained	1
not	1
to	1
begin	1
Thenceforth	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
servant	1
to	1
assume;	1
As	1
when	1
he	1
washed	1
his	1
servants	1
feet;	1
so	1
now,	1
As	1
father	1
of	1
his	1
family,	1
he	1
clad	1
Their	1
nakedness	1
with	1
skins	1
of	1
beasts,	1
or	1
slain,	1
Or	1
as	1
the	1
snake	1
with	1
youthful	1
coat	1
repaid;	1
And	1
thought	1
not	1
much	1
to	1
clothe	1
his	1
enemies;	1
Nor	1
he	1
their	1
outward	1
only	1
with	1
the	1
skins	1
Of	1
beasts,	1
but	1
inward	1
nakedness,	1
much	1
more.	1
Opprobrious,	1
with	1
his	1
robe	1
of	1
righteousness,	1
Arraying,	1
covered	1
from	1
his	1
Father's	1
sight.	1
To	1
him	1
with	1
swift	1
ascent	1
he	1
up	1
returned,	1
Into	1
his	1
blissful	1
bosom	1
reassumed	1
In	1
glory,	1
as	1
of	1
old;	1
to	1
him	1
appeased	1
All,	1
though	1
all-knowing,	1
what	1
had	1
passed	1
with	1
Man	1
Recounted,	1
mixing	1
intercession	1
sweet.	1
Mean	1
while,	1
ere	1
thus	1
was	1
sinned	1
and	1
judged	1
on	1
Earth,	1
Within	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
Hell	1
sat	1
Sin	1
and	1
Death,	1
In	1
counterview	1
within	1
the	1
gates,	1
that	1
now	1
Stood	1
open	1
wide,	1
belching	1
outrageous	1
flame	1
Far	1
into	1
Chaos,	1
since	1
the	1
Fiend	1
passed	1
through,	1
Sin	1
opening;	1
who	1
thus	1
now	1
to	1
Death	1
began.	1
O	1
Son,	1
why	1
sit	1
we	1
here	1
each	1
other	1
viewing	1
Idly,	1
while	1
Satan,	1
our	1
great	1
author,	1
thrives	1
In	1
other	1
worlds,	1
and	1
happier	1
seat	1
provides	1
For	1
us,	1
his	1
offspring	1
dear?	1
It	1
cannot	1
be	1
But	1
that	1
success	1
attends	1
him;	1
if	1
mishap,	1
Ere	1
this	1
he	1
had	1
returned,	1
with	1
fury	1
driven	1
By	1
his	1
avengers;	1
since	1
no	1
place	1
like	1
this	1
Can	1
fit	1
his	1
punishment,	1
or	1
their	1
revenge.	1
Methinks	1
I	1
feel	1
new	1
strength	1
within	1
me	1
rise,	1
Wings	1
growing,	1
and	1
dominion	1
given	1
me	1
large	1
Beyond	1
this	1
deep;	1
whatever	1
draws	1
me	1
on,	1
Or	1
sympathy,	1
or	1
some	1
connatural	1
force,	1
Powerful	1
at	1
greatest	1
distance	1
to	1
unite,	1
With	1
secret	1
amity,	1
things	1
of	1
like	1
kind,	1
By	1
secretest	1
conveyance.	1
Thou,	1
my	1
shade	1
Inseparable,	1
must	1
with	1
me	1
along;	1
For	1
Death	1
from	1
Sin	1
no	1
power	1
can	1
separate.	1
But,	1
lest	1
the	1
difficulty	1
of	1
passing	1
back	1
Stay	1
his	1
return	1
perhaps	1
over	1
this	1
gulf	1
Impassable,	1
impervious;	1
let	1
us	1
try	1
Adventurous	1
work,	1
yet	1
to	1
thy	1
power	1
and	1
mine	1
Not	1
unagreeable,	1
to	1
found	1
a	1
path	1
Over	1
this	1
main	1
from	1
Hell	1
to	1
that	1
new	1
world,	1
Where	1
Satan	1
now	1
prevails;	1
a	1
monument	1
Of	1
merit	1
high	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
infernal	1
host,	1
Easing	1
their	1
passage	1
hence,	1
for	1
intercourse,	1
Or	1
transmigration,	1
as	1
their	1
lot	1
shall	1
lead.	1
Nor	1
can	1
I	1
miss	1
the	1
way,	1
so	1
strongly	1
drawn	1
By	1
this	1
new-felt	1
attraction	1
and	1
instinct.	1
Whom	1
thus	1
the	1
meager	1
Shadow	1
answered	1
soon.	1
Go,	1
whither	1
Fate,	1
and	1
inclination	1
strong,	1
Leads	1
thee;	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
lag	1
behind,	1
nor	1
err	1
The	1
way,	1
thou	1
leading;	1
such	1
a	1
scent	1
I	1
draw	1
Of	1
carnage,	1
prey	1
innumerable,	1
and	1
taste	1
The	1
savour	1
of	1
death	1
from	1
all	1
things	1
there	1
that	1
live:	1
Nor	1
shall	1
I	1
to	1
the	1
work	1
thou	1
enterprisest	1
Be	1
wanting,	1
but	1
afford	1
thee	1
equal	1
aid.	1
So	1
saying,	1
with	1
delight	1
he	1
snuffed	1
the	1
smell	1
Of	1
mortal	1
change	1
on	1
earth.	1
As	1
when	1
a	1
flock	1
Of	1
ravenous	1
fowl,	1
though	1
many	1
a	1
league	1
remote,	1
Against	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
battle,	1
to	1
a	1
field,	1
Where	1
armies	1
lie	1
encamped,	1
come	1
flying,	1
lured	1
With	1
scent	1
of	1
living	1
carcasses	1
designed	1
For	1
death,	1
the	1
following	1
day,	1
in	1
bloody	1
fight:	1
So	1
scented	1
the	1
grim	1
Feature,	1
and	1
upturned	1
His	1
nostril	1
wide	1
into	1
the	1
murky	1
air;	1
Sagacious	1
of	1
his	1
quarry	1
from	1
so	1
far.	1
Then	1
both	1
from	1
out	1
Hell-gates,	1
into	1
the	1
waste	1
Wide	1
anarchy	1
of	1
Chaos,	1
damp	1
and	1
dark,	1
Flew	1
diverse;	1
and	1
with	1
power	1
(their	1
power	1
was	1
great)	1
Hovering	1
upon	1
the	1
waters,	1
what	1
they	1
met	1
Solid	1
or	1
slimy,	1
as	1
in	1
raging	1
sea	1
Tost	1
up	1
and	1
down,	1
together	1
crouded	1
drove,	1
From	1
each	1
side	1
shoaling	1
towards	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
Hell;	1
As	1
when	1
two	1
polar	1
winds,	1
blowing	1
adverse	1
Upon	1
the	1
Cronian	1
sea,	1
together	1
drive	1
Mountains	1
of	1
ice,	1
that	1
stop	1
the	1
imagined	1
way	1
Beyond	1
Petsora	1
eastward,	1
to	1
the	1
rich	1
Cathaian	1
coast.	1
The	1
aggregated	1
soil	1
Death	1
with	1
his	1
mace	1
petrifick,	1
cold	1
and	1
dry,	1
As	1
with	1
a	1
trident,	1
smote;	1
and	1
fixed	1
as	1
firm	1
As	1
Delos,	1
floating	1
once;	1
the	1
rest	1
his	1
look	1
Bound	1
with	1
Gorgonian	1
rigour	1
not	1
to	1
move;	1
And	1
with	1
Asphaltick	1
slime,	1
broad	1
as	1
the	1
gate,	1
Deep	1
to	1
the	1
roots	1
of	1
Hell	1
the	1
gathered	1
beach	1
They	1
fastened,	1
and	1
the	1
mole	1
immense	1
wrought	1
on	1
Over	1
the	1
foaming	1
deep	1
high-arched,	1
a	1
bridge	1
Of	1
length	1
prodigious,	1
joining	1
to	1
the	1
wall	1
Immoveable	1
of	1
this	1
now	1
fenceless	1
world,	1
Forfeit	1
to	1
Death;	1
from	1
hence	1
a	1
passage	1
broad,	1
Smooth,	1
easy,	1
inoffensive,	1
down	1
to	1
Hell.	1
So,	1
if	1
great	1
things	1
to	1
small	1
may	1
be	1
compared,	1
Xerxes,	1
the	1
liberty	1
of	1
Greece	1
to	1
yoke,	1
From	1
Susa,	1
his	1
Memnonian	1
palace	1
high,	1
Came	1
to	1
the	1
sea:	1
and,	1
over	1
Hellespont	1
Bridging	1
his	1
way,	1
Europe	1
with	1
Asia	1
joined,	1
And	1
scourged	1
with	1
many	1
a	1
stroke	1
the	1
indignant	1
waves.	1
Now	1
had	1
they	1
brought	1
the	1
work	1
by	1
wonderous	1
art	1
Pontifical,	1
a	1
ridge	1
of	1
pendant	1
rock,	1
Over	1
the	1
vexed	1
abyss,	1
following	1
the	1
track	1
Of	1
Satan	1
to	1
the	1
self-same	1
place	1
where	1
he	1
First	1
lighted	1
from	1
his	1
wing,	1
and	1
landed	1
safe	1
From	1
out	1
of	1
Chaos,	1
to	1
the	1
outside	1
bare	1
Of	1
this	1
round	1
world:	1
With	1
pins	1
of	1
adamant	1
And	1
chains	1
they	1
made	1
all	1
fast,	1
too	1
fast	1
they	1
made	1
And	1
durable!	1
And	1
now	1
in	1
little	1
space	1
The	1
confines	1
met	1
of	1
empyrean	1
Heaven,	1
And	1
of	1
this	1
World;	1
and,	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
hand,	1
Hell	1
With	1
long	1
reach	1
interposed;	1
three	1
several	1
ways	1
In	1
sight,	1
to	1
each	1
of	1
these	1
three	1
places	1
led.	1
And	1
now	1
their	1
way	1
to	1
Earth	1
they	1
had	1
descried,	1
To	1
Paradise	1
first	1
tending;	1
when,	1
behold!	1
Satan,	1
in	1
likeness	1
of	1
an	1
Angel	1
bright,	1
Betwixt	1
the	1
Centaur	1
and	1
the	1
Scorpion	1
steering	1
His	1
zenith,	1
while	1
the	1
sun	1
in	1
Aries	1
rose:	1
Disguised	1
he	1
came;	1
but	1
those	1
his	1
children	1
dear	1
Their	1
parent	1
soon	1
discerned,	1
though	1
in	1
disguise.	1
He,	1
after	1
Eve	1
seduced,	1
unminded	1
slunk	1
Into	1
the	1
wood	1
fast	1
by;	1
and,	1
changing	1
shape,	1
To	1
observe	1
the	1
sequel,	1
saw	1
his	1
guileful	1
act	1
By	1
Eve,	1
though	1
all	1
unweeting,	1
seconded	1
Upon	1
her	1
husband;	1
saw	1
their	1
shame	1
that	1
sought	1
Vain	1
covertures;	1
but	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
descend	1
The	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
to	1
judge	1
them,	1
terrified	1
He	1
fled;	1
not	1
hoping	1
to	1
escape,	1
but	1
shun	1
The	1
present;	1
fearing,	1
guilty,	1
what	1
his	1
wrath	1
Might	1
suddenly	1
inflict;	1
that	1
past,	1
returned	1
By	1
night,	1
and	1
listening	1
where	1
the	1
hapless	1
pair	1
Sat	1
in	1
their	1
sad	1
discourse,	1
and	1
various	1
plaint,	1
Thence	1
gathered	1
his	1
own	1
doom;	1
which	1
understood	1
Not	1
instant,	1
but	1
of	1
future	1
time,	1
with	1
joy	1
And	1
tidings	1
fraught,	1
to	1
Hell	1
he	1
now	1
returned;	1
And	1
at	1
the	1
brink	1
of	1
Chaos,	1
near	1
the	1
foot	1
Of	1
this	1
new	1
wonderous	1
pontifice,	1
unhoped	1
Met,	1
who	1
to	1
meet	1
him	1
came,	1
his	1
offspring	1
dear.	1
Great	1
joy	1
was	1
at	1
their	1
meeting,	1
and	1
at	1
sight	1
Of	1
that	1
stupendious	1
bridge	1
his	1
joy	1
encreased.	1
Long	1
he	1
admiring	1
stood,	1
till	1
Sin,	1
his	1
fair	1
Enchanting	1
daughter,	1
thus	1
the	1
silence	1
broke.	1
O	1
Parent,	1
these	1
are	1
thy	1
magnifick	1
deeds,	1
Thy	1
trophies!	1
which	1
thou	1
viewest	1
as	1
not	1
thine	1
own;	1
Thou	1
art	1
their	1
author,	1
and	1
prime	1
architect:	1
For	1
I	1
no	1
sooner	1
in	1
my	1
heart	1
divined,	1
My	1
heart,	1
which	1
by	1
a	1
secret	1
harmony	1
Still	1
moves	1
with	1
thine,	1
joined	1
in	1
connexion	1
sweet,	1
That	1
thou	1
on	1
earth	1
hadst	1
prospered,	1
which	1
thy	1
looks	1
Now	1
also	1
evidence,	1
but	1
straight	1
I	1
felt,	1
Though	1
distant	1
from	1
thee	1
worlds	1
between,	1
yet	1
felt,	1
That	1
I	1
must	1
after	1
thee,	1
with	1
this	1
thy	1
son;	1
Such	1
fatal	1
consequence	1
unites	1
us	1
three!	1
Hell	1
could	1
no	1
longer	1
hold	1
us	1
in	1
our	1
bounds,	1
Nor	1
this	1
unvoyageable	1
gulf	1
obscure	1
Detain	1
from	1
following	1
thy	1
illustrious	1
track.	1
Thou	1
hast	1
achieved	1
our	1
liberty,	1
confined	1
Within	1
Hell-gates	1
till	1
now;	1
thou	1
us	1
impowered	1
To	1
fortify	1
thus	1
far,	1
and	1
overlay,	1
With	1
this	1
portentous	1
bridge,	1
the	1
dark	1
abyss.	1
Thine	1
now	1
is	1
all	1
this	1
world;	1
thy	1
virtue	1
hath	1
won	1
What	1
thy	1
hands	1
builded	1
not;	1
thy	1
wisdom	1
gained	1
With	1
odds	1
what	1
war	1
hath	1
lost,	1
and	1
fully	1
avenged	1
Our	1
foil	1
in	1
Heaven;	1
here	1
thou	1
shalt	1
monarch	1
reign,	1
There	1
didst	1
not;	1
there	1
let	1
him	1
still	1
victor	1
sway,	1
As	1
battle	1
hath	1
adjudged;	1
from	1
this	1
new	1
world	1
Retiring,	1
by	1
his	1
own	1
doom	1
alienated;	1
And	1
henceforth	1
monarchy	1
with	1
thee	1
divide	1
Of	1
all	1
things,	1
parted	1
by	1
the	1
empyreal	1
bounds,	1
His	1
quadrature,	1
from	1
thy	1
orbicular	1
world;	1
Or	1
try	1
thee	1
now	1
more	1
dangerous	1
to	1
his	1
throne.	1
Whom	1
thus	1
the	1
Prince	1
of	1
darkness	1
answered	1
glad.	1
Fair	1
Daughter,	1
and	1
thou	1
Son	1
and	1
Grandchild	1
both;	1
High	1
proof	1
ye	1
now	1
have	1
given	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
race	1
Of	1
Satan	1
(for	1
I	1
glory	1
in	1
the	1
name,	1
Antagonist	1
of	1
Heaven's	1
Almighty	1
King,)	1
Amply	1
have	1
merited	1
of	1
me,	1
of	1
all	1
The	1
infernal	1
empire,	1
that	1
so	1
near	1
Heaven's	1
door	1
Triumphal	1
with	1
triumphal	1
act	1
have	1
met,	1
Mine,	1
with	1
this	1
glorious	1
work;	1
and	1
made	1
one	1
realm,	1
Hell	1
and	1
this	1
world,	1
one	1
realm,	1
one	1
continent	1
Of	1
easy	1
thorough-fare.	1
Therefore,	1
while	1
I	1
Descend	1
through	1
darkness,	1
on	1
your	1
road	1
with	1
ease,	1
To	1
my	1
associate	1
Powers,	1
them	1
to	1
acquaint	1
With	1
these	1
successes,	1
and	1
with	1
them	1
rejoice;	1
You	1
two	1
this	1
way,	1
among	1
these	1
numerous	1
orbs,	1
All	1
yours,	1
right	1
down	1
to	1
Paradise	1
descend;	1
There	1
dwell,	1
and	1
reign	1
in	1
bliss;	1
thence	1
on	1
the	1
earth	1
Dominion	1
exercise	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
air,	1
Chiefly	1
on	1
Man,	1
sole	1
lord	1
of	1
all	1
declared;	1
Him	1
first	1
make	1
sure	1
your	1
thrall,	1
and	1
lastly	1
kill.	1
My	1
substitutes	1
I	1
send	1
ye,	1
and	1
create	1
Plenipotent	1
on	1
earth,	1
of	1
matchless	1
might	1
Issuing	1
from	1
me:	1
on	1
your	1
joint	1
vigour	1
now	1
My	1
hold	1
of	1
this	1
new	1
kingdom	1
all	1
depends,	1
Through	1
Sin	1
to	1
Death	1
exposed	1
by	1
my	1
exploit.	1
If	1
your	1
joint	1
power	1
prevail,	1
the	1
affairs	1
of	1
Hell	1
No	1
detriment	1
need	1
fear;	1
go,	1
and	1
be	1
strong!	1
So	1
saying	1
he	1
dismissed	1
them;	1
they	1
with	1
speed	1
Their	1
course	1
through	1
thickest	1
constellations	1
held,	1
Spreading	1
their	1
bane;	1
the	1
blasted	1
stars	1
looked	1
wan,	1
And	1
planets,	1
planet-struck,	1
real	1
eclipse	1
Then	1
suffered.	1
The	1
other	1
way	1
Satan	1
went	1
down	1
The	1
causey	1
to	1
Hell-gate:	1
On	1
either	1
side	1
Disparted	1
Chaos	1
overbuilt	1
exclaimed,	1
And	1
with	1
rebounding	1
surge	1
the	1
bars	1
assailed,	1
That	1
scorned	1
his	1
indignation:	1
Through	1
the	1
gate,	1
Wide	1
open	1
and	1
unguarded,	1
Satan	1
passed,	1
And	1
all	1
about	1
found	1
desolate;	1
for	1
those,	1
Appointed	1
to	1
sit	1
there,	1
had	1
left	1
their	1
charge,	1
Flown	1
to	1
the	1
upper	1
world;	1
the	1
rest	1
were	1
all	1
Far	1
to	1
the	1
inland	1
retired,	1
about	1
the	1
walls	1
Of	1
Pandemonium;	1
city	1
and	1
proud	1
seat	1
Of	1
Lucifer,	1
so	1
by	1
allusion	1
called	1
Of	1
that	1
bright	1
star	1
to	1
Satan	1
paragoned;	1
There	1
kept	1
their	1
watch	1
the	1
legions,	1
while	1
the	1
Grand	1
In	1
council	1
sat,	1
solicitous	1
what	1
chance	1
Might	1
intercept	1
their	1
emperour	1
sent;	1
so	1
he	1
Departing	1
gave	1
command,	1
and	1
they	1
observed.	1
As	1
when	1
the	1
Tartar	1
from	1
his	1
Russian	1
foe,	1
By	1
Astracan,	1
over	1
the	1
snowy	1
plains,	1
Retires;	1
or	1
Bactrin	1
Sophi,	1
from	1
the	1
horns	1
Of	1
Turkish	1
crescent,	1
leaves	1
all	1
waste	1
beyond	1
The	1
realm	1
of	1
Aladule,	1
in	1
his	1
retreat	1
To	1
Tauris	1
or	1
Casbeen:	1
So	1
these,	1
the	1
late	1
Heaven-banished	1
host,	1
left	1
desart	1
utmost	1
Hell	1
Many	1
a	1
dark	1
league,	1
reduced	1
in	1
careful	1
watch	1
Round	1
their	1
metropolis;	1
and	1
now	1
expecting	1
Each	1
hour	1
their	1
great	1
adventurer,	1
from	1
the	1
search	1
Of	1
foreign	1
worlds:	1
He	1
through	1
the	1
midst	1
unmarked,	1
In	1
show	1
plebeian	1
Angel	1
militant	1
Of	1
lowest	1
order,	1
passed;	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
door	1
Of	1
that	1
Plutonian	1
hall,	1
invisible	1
Ascended	1
his	1
high	1
throne;	1
which,	1
under	1
state	1
Of	1
richest	1
texture	1
spread,	1
at	1
the	1
upper	1
end	1
Was	1
placed	1
in	1
regal	1
lustre.	1
Down	1
a	1
while	1
He	1
sat,	1
and	1
round	1
about	1
him	1
saw	1
unseen:	1
At	1
last,	1
as	1
from	1
a	1
cloud,	1
his	1
fulgent	1
head	1
And	1
shape	1
star-bright	1
appeared,	1
or	1
brighter;	1
clad	1
With	1
what	1
permissive	1
glory	1
since	1
his	1
fall	1
Was	1
left	1
him,	1
or	1
false	1
glitter:	1
All	1
amazed	1
At	1
that	1
so	1
sudden	1
blaze	1
the	1
Stygian	1
throng	1
Bent	1
their	1
aspect,	1
and	1
whom	1
they	1
wished	1
beheld,	1
Their	1
mighty	1
Chief	1
returned:	1
loud	1
was	1
the	1
acclaim:	1
Forth	1
rushed	1
in	1
haste	1
the	1
great	1
consulting	1
peers,	1
Raised	1
from	1
their	1
dark	1
Divan,	1
and	1
with	1
like	1
joy	1
Congratulant	1
approached	1
him;	1
who	1
with	1
hand	1
Silence,	1
and	1
with	1
these	1
words	1
attention,	1
won.	1
Thrones,	1
Dominations,	1
Princedoms,	1
Virtues,	1
Powers;	1
For	1
in	1
possession	1
such,	1
not	1
only	1
of	1
right,	1
I	1
call	1
ye,	1
and	1
declare	1
ye	1
now;	1
returned	1
Successful	1
beyond	1
hope,	1
to	1
lead	1
ye	1
forth	1
Triumphant	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
infernal	1
pit	1
Abominable,	1
accursed,	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
woe,	1
And	1
dungeon	1
of	1
our	1
tyrant:	1
Now	1
possess,	1
As	1
Lords,	1
a	1
spacious	1
world,	1
to	1
our	1
native	1
Heaven	1
Little	1
inferiour,	1
by	1
my	1
adventure	1
hard	1
With	1
peril	1
great	1
achieved.	1
Long	1
were	1
to	1
tell	1
What	1
I	1
have	1
done;	1
what	1
suffered;with	1
what	1
pain	1
Voyaged	1
th'	1
unreal,	1
vast,	1
unbounded	1
deep	1
Of	1
horrible	1
confusion;	1
over	1
which	1
By	1
Sin	1
and	1
Death	1
a	1
broad	1
way	1
now	1
is	1
paved,	1
To	1
expedite	1
your	1
glorious	1
march;	1
but	1
I	1
Toiled	1
out	1
my	1
uncouth	1
passage,	1
forced	1
to	1
ride	1
The	1
untractable	1
abyss,	1
plunged	1
in	1
the	1
womb	1
Of	1
unoriginal	1
Night	1
and	1
Chaos	1
wild;	1
That,	1
jealous	1
of	1
their	1
secrets,	1
fiercely	1
opposed	1
My	1
journey	1
strange,	1
with	1
clamorous	1
uproar	1
Protesting	1
Fate	1
supreme;	1
thence	1
how	1
I	1
found	1
The	1
new	1
created	1
world,	1
which	1
fame	1
in	1
Heaven	1
Long	1
had	1
foretold,	1
a	1
fabrick	1
wonderful	1
Of	1
absolute	1
perfection!	1
therein	1
Man	1
Placed	1
in	1
a	1
Paradise,	1
by	1
our	1
exile	1
Made	1
happy:	1
Him	1
by	1
fraud	1
I	1
have	1
seduced	1
From	1
his	1
Creator;	1
and,	1
the	1
more	1
to	1
encrease	1
Your	1
wonder,	1
with	1
an	1
apple;	1
he,	1
thereat	1
Offended,	1
worth	1
your	1
laughter!	1
hath	1
given	1
up	1
Both	1
his	1
beloved	1
Man,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
world,	1
To	1
Sin	1
and	1
Death	1
a	1
prey,	1
and	1
so	1
to	1
us,	1
Without	1
our	1
hazard,	1
labour,	1
or	1
alarm;	1
To	1
range	1
in,	1
and	1
to	1
dwell,	1
and	1
over	1
Man	1
To	1
rule,	1
as	1
over	1
all	1
he	1
should	1
have	1
ruled.	1
True	1
is,	1
me	1
also	1
he	1
hath	1
judged,	1
or	1
rather	1
Me	1
not,	1
but	1
the	1
brute	1
serpent	1
in	1
whose	1
shape	1
Man	1
I	1
deceived:	1
that	1
which	1
to	1
me	1
belongs,	1
Is	1
enmity	1
which	1
he	1
will	1
put	1
between	1
Me	1
and	1
mankind;	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
bruise	1
his	1
heel;	1
His	1
seed,	1
when	1
is	1
not	1
set,	1
shall	1
bruise	1
my	1
head:	1
A	1
world	1
who	1
would	1
not	1
purchase	1
with	1
a	1
bruise,	1
Or	1
much	1
more	1
grievous	1
pain?--Ye	1
have	1
the	1
account	1
Of	1
my	1
performance:	1
What	1
remains,	1
ye	1
Gods,	1
But	1
up,	1
and	1
enter	1
now	1
into	1
full	1
bliss?	1
So	1
having	1
said,	1
a	1
while	1
he	1
stood,	1
expecting	1
Their	1
universal	1
shout,	1
and	1
high	1
applause,	1
To	1
fill	1
his	1
ear;	1
when,	1
contrary,	1
he	1
hears	1
On	1
all	1
sides,	1
from	1
innumerable	1
tongues,	1
A	1
dismal	1
universal	1
hiss,	1
the	1
sound	1
Of	1
publick	1
scorn;	1
he	1
wondered,	1
but	1
not	1
long	1
Had	1
leisure,	1
wondering	1
at	1
himself	1
now	1
more,	1
His	1
visage	1
drawn	1
he	1
felt	1
to	1
sharp	1
and	1
spare;	1
His	1
arms	1
clung	1
to	1
his	1
ribs;	1
his	1
legs	1
entwining	1
Each	1
other,	1
till	1
supplanted	1
down	1
he	1
fell	1
A	1
monstrous	1
serpent	1
on	1
his	1
belly	1
prone,	1
Reluctant,	1
but	1
in	1
vain;	1
a	1
greater	1
power	1
Now	1
ruled	1
him,	1
punished	1
in	1
the	1
shape	1
he	1
sinned,	1
According	1
to	1
his	1
doom:	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
spoke,	1
But	1
hiss	1
for	1
hiss	1
returned	1
with	1
forked	1
tongue	1
To	1
forked	1
tongue;	1
for	1
now	1
were	1
all	1
transformed	1
Alike,	1
to	1
serpents	1
all,	1
as	1
accessories	1
To	1
his	1
bold	1
riot:	1
Dreadful	1
was	1
the	1
din	1
Of	1
hissing	1
through	1
the	1
hall,	1
thick	1
swarming	1
now	1
With	1
complicated	1
monsters	1
head	1
and	1
tail,	1
Scorpion,	1
and	1
Asp,	1
and	1
Amphisbaena	1
dire,	1
Cerastes	1
horned,	1
Hydrus,	1
and	1
Elops	1
drear,	1
And	1
Dipsas;	1
(not	1
so	1
thick	1
swarmed	1
once	1
the	1
soil	1
Bedropt	1
with	1
blood	1
of	1
Gorgon,	1
or	1
the	1
isle	1
Ophiusa,)	1
but	1
still	1
greatest	1
he	1
the	1
midst,	1
Now	1
Dragon	1
grown,	1
larger	1
than	1
whom	1
the	1
sun	1
Ingendered	1
in	1
the	1
Pythian	1
vale	1
or	1
slime,	1
Huge	1
Python,	1
and	1
his	1
power	1
no	1
less	1
he	1
seemed	1
Above	1
the	1
rest	1
still	1
to	1
retain;	1
they	1
all	1
Him	1
followed,	1
issuing	1
forth	1
to	1
the	1
open	1
field,	1
Where	1
all	1
yet	1
left	1
of	1
that	1
revolted	1
rout,	1
Heaven-fallen,	1
in	1
station	1
stood	1
or	1
just	1
array;	1
Sublime	1
with	1
expectation	1
when	1
to	1
see	1
In	1
triumph	1
issuing	1
forth	1
their	1
glorious	1
Chief;	1
They	1
saw,	1
but	1
other	1
sight	1
instead!	1
a	1
croud	1
Of	1
ugly	1
serpents;	1
horrour	1
on	1
them	1
fell,	1
And	1
horrid	1
sympathy;	1
for,	1
what	1
they	1
saw,	1
They	1
felt	1
themselves,	1
now	1
changing;	1
down	1
their	1
arms,	1
Down	1
fell	1
both	1
spear	1
and	1
shield;	1
down	1
they	1
as	1
fast;	1
And	1
the	1
dire	1
hiss	1
renewed,	1
and	1
the	1
dire	1
form	1
Catched,	1
by	1
contagion;	1
like	1
in	1
punishment,	1
As	1
in	1
their	1
crime.	1
Thus	1
was	1
the	1
applause	1
they	1
meant,	1
Turned	1
to	1
exploding	1
hiss,	1
triumph	1
to	1
shame	1
Cast	1
on	1
themselves	1
from	1
their	1
own	1
mouths.	1
There	1
stood	1
A	1
grove	1
hard	1
by,	1
sprung	1
up	1
with	1
this	1
their	1
change,	1
His	1
will	1
who	1
reigns	1
above,	1
to	1
aggravate	1
Their	1
penance,	1
laden	1
with	1
fair	1
fruit,	1
like	1
that	1
Which	1
grew	1
in	1
Paradise,	1
the	1
bait	1
of	1
Eve	1
Used	1
by	1
the	1
Tempter:	1
on	1
that	1
prospect	1
strange	1
Their	1
earnest	1
eyes	1
they	1
fixed,	1
imagining	1
For	1
one	1
forbidden	1
tree	1
a	1
multitude	1
Now	1
risen,	1
to	1
work	1
them	1
further	1
woe	1
or	1
shame;	1
Yet,	1
parched	1
with	1
scalding	1
thirst	1
and	1
hunger	1
fierce,	1
Though	1
to	1
delude	1
them	1
sent,	1
could	1
not	1
abstain;	1
But	1
on	1
they	1
rolled	1
in	1
heaps,	1
and,	1
up	1
the	1
trees	1
Climbing,	1
sat	1
thicker	1
than	1
the	1
snaky	1
locks	1
That	1
curled	1
Megaera:	1
greedily	1
they	1
plucked	1
The	1
fruitage	1
fair	1
to	1
sight,	1
like	1
that	1
which	1
grew	1
Near	1
that	1
bituminous	1
lake	1
where	1
Sodom	1
flamed;	1
This	1
more	1
delusive,	1
not	1
the	1
touch,	1
but	1
taste	1
Deceived;	1
they,	1
fondly	1
thinking	1
to	1
allay	1
Their	1
appetite	1
with	1
gust,	1
instead	1
of	1
fruit	1
Chewed	1
bitter	1
ashes,	1
which	1
the	1
offended	1
taste	1
With	1
spattering	1
noise	1
rejected:	1
oft	1
they	1
assayed,	1
Hunger	1
and	1
thirst	1
constraining;	1
drugged	1
as	1
oft,	1
With	1
hatefullest	1
disrelish	1
writhed	1
their	1
jaws,	1
With	1
soot	1
and	1
cinders	1
filled;	1
so	1
oft	1
they	1
fell	1
Into	1
the	1
same	1
illusion,	1
not	1
as	1
Man	1
Whom	1
they	1
triumphed	1
once	1
lapsed.	1
Thus	1
were	1
they	1
plagued	1
And	1
worn	1
with	1
famine,	1
long	1
and	1
ceaseless	1
hiss,	1
Till	1
their	1
lost	1
shape,	1
permitted,	1
they	1
resumed;	1
Yearly	1
enjoined,	1
some	1
say,	1
to	1
undergo,	1
This	1
annual	1
humbling	1
certain	1
numbered	1
days,	1
To	1
dash	1
their	1
pride,	1
and	1
joy,	1
for	1
Man	1
seduced.	1
However,	1
some	1
tradition	1
they	1
dispersed	1
Among	1
the	1
Heathen,	1
of	1
their	1
purchase	1
got,	1
And	1
fabled	1
how	1
the	1
Serpent,	1
whom	1
they	1
called	1
Ophion,	1
with	1
Eurynome,	1
the	1
wide--	1
Encroaching	1
Eve	1
perhaps,	1
had	1
first	1
the	1
rule	1
Of	1
high	1
Olympus;	1
thence	1
by	1
Saturn	1
driven	1
And	1
Ops,	1
ere	1
yet	1
Dictaean	1
Jove	1
was	1
born.	1
Mean	1
while	1
in	1
Paradise	1
the	1
hellish	1
pair	1
Too	1
soon	1
arrived;	1
Sin,	1
there	1
in	1
power	1
before,	1
Once	1
actual;	1
now	1
in	1
body,	1
and	1
to	1
dwell	1
Habitual	1
habitant;	1
behind	1
her	1
Death,	1
Close	1
following	1
pace	1
for	1
pace,	1
not	1
mounted	1
yet	1
On	1
his	1
pale	1
horse:	1
to	1
whom	1
Sin	1
thus	1
began.	1
Second	1
of	1
Satan	1
sprung,	1
all-conquering	1
Death!	1
What	1
thinkest	1
thou	1
of	1
our	1
empire	1
now,	1
though	1
earned	1
With	1
travel	1
difficult,	1
not	1
better	1
far	1
Than	1
still	1
at	1
Hell's	1
dark	1
threshold	1
to	1
have	1
sat	1
watch,	1
Unnamed,	1
undreaded,	1
and	1
thyself	1
half	1
starved?	1
Whom	1
thus	1
the	1
Sin-born	1
monster	1
answered	1
soon.	1
To	1
me,	1
who	1
with	1
eternal	1
famine	1
pine,	1
Alike	1
is	1
Hell,	1
or	1
Paradise,	1
or	1
Heaven;	1
There	1
best,	1
where	1
most	1
with	1
ravine	1
I	1
may	1
meet;	1
Which	1
here,	1
though	1
plenteous,	1
all	1
too	1
little	1
seems	1
To	1
stuff	1
this	1
maw,	1
this	1
vast	1
unhide-bound	1
corps.	1
To	1
whom	1
the	1
incestuous	1
mother	1
thus	1
replied.	1
Thou	1
therefore	1
on	1
these	1
herbs,	1
and	1
fruits,	1
and	1
flowers,	1
Feed	1
first;	1
on	1
each	1
beast	1
next,	1
and	1
fish,	1
and	1
fowl;	1
No	1
homely	1
morsels!	1
and,	1
whatever	1
thing	1
The	1
sithe	1
of	1
Time	1
mows	1
down,	1
devour	1
unspared;	1
Till	1
I,	1
in	1
Man	1
residing,	1
through	1
the	1
race,	1
His	1
thoughts,	1
his	1
looks,	1
words,	1
actions,	1
all	1
infect;	1
And	1
season	1
him	1
thy	1
last	1
and	1
sweetest	1
prey.	1
This	1
said,	1
they	1
both	1
betook	1
them	1
several	1
ways,	1
Both	1
to	1
destroy,	1
or	1
unimmortal	1
make	1
All	1
kinds,	1
and	1
for	1
destruction	1
to	1
mature	1
Sooner	1
or	1
later;	1
which	1
the	1
Almighty	1
seeing,	1
From	1
his	1
transcendent	1
seat	1
the	1
Saints	1
among,	1
To	1
those	1
bright	1
Orders	1
uttered	1
thus	1
his	1
voice.	1
See,	1
with	1
what	1
heat	1
these	1
dogs	1
of	1
Hell	1
advance	1
To	1
waste	1
and	1
havock	1
yonder	1
world,	1
which	1
I	1
So	1
fair	1
and	1
good	1
created;	1
and	1
had	1
still	1
Kept	1
in	1
that	1
state,	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
folly	1
of	1
Man	1
Let	1
in	1
these	1
wasteful	1
furies,	1
who	1
impute	1
Folly	1
to	1
me;	1
so	1
doth	1
the	1
Prince	1
of	1
Hell	1
And	1
his	1
adherents,	1
that	1
with	1
so	1
much	1
ease	1
I	1
suffer	1
them	1
to	1
enter	1
and	1
possess	1
A	1
place	1
so	1
heavenly;	1
and,	1
conniving,	1
seem	1
To	1
gratify	1
my	1
scornful	1
enemies,	1
That	1
laugh,	1
as	1
if,	1
transported	1
with	1
some	1
fit	1
Of	1
passion,	1
I	1
to	1
them	1
had	1
quitted	1
all,	1
At	1
random	1
yielded	1
up	1
to	1
their	1
misrule;	1
And	1
know	1
not	1
that	1
I	1
called,	1
and	1
drew	1
them	1
thither,	1
My	1
Hell-hounds,	1
to	1
lick	1
up	1
the	1
draff	1
and	1
filth	1
Which	1
Man's	1
polluting	1
sin	1
with	1
taint	1
hath	1
shed	1
On	1
what	1
was	1
pure;	1
til,	1
crammed	1
and	1
gorged,	1
nigh	1
burst	1
With	1
sucked	1
and	1
glutted	1
offal,	1
at	1
one	1
sling	1
Of	1
thy	1
victorious	1
arm,	1
well-pleasing	1
Son,	1
Both	1
Sin,	1
and	1
Death,	1
and	1
yawning	1
Grave,	1
at	1
last,	1
Through	1
Chaos	1
hurled,	1
obstruct	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
Hell	1
For	1
ever,	1
and	1
seal	1
up	1
his	1
ravenous	1
jaws.	1
Then	1
Heaven	1
and	1
Earth	1
renewed	1
shall	1
be	1
made	1
pure	1
To	1
sanctity,	1
that	1
shall	1
receive	1
no	1
stain:	1
Till	1
then,	1
the	1
curse	1
pronounced	1
on	1
both	1
precedes.	1
He	1
ended,	1
and	1
the	1
heavenly	1
audience	1
loud	1
Sung	1
Halleluiah,	1
as	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
seas,	1
Through	1
multitude	1
that	1
sung:	1
Just	1
are	1
thy	1
ways,	1
Righteous	1
are	1
thy	1
decrees	1
on	1
all	1
thy	1
works;	1
Who	1
can	1
extenuate	1
thee?	1
Next,	1
to	1
the	1
Son,	1
Destined	1
Restorer	1
of	1
mankind,	1
by	1
whom	1
New	1
Heaven	1
and	1
Earth	1
shall	1
to	1
the	1
ages	1
rise,	1
Or	1
down	1
from	1
Heaven	1
descend.--Such	1
was	1
their	1
song;	1
While	1
the	1
Creator,	1
calling	1
forth	1
by	1
name	1
His	1
mighty	1
Angels,	1
gave	1
them	1
several	1
charge,	1
As	1
sorted	1
best	1
with	1
present	1
things.	1
The	1
sun	1
Had	1
first	1
his	1
precept	1
so	1
to	1
move,	1
so	1
shine,	1
As	1
might	1
affect	1
the	1
earth	1
with	1
cold	1
and	1
heat	1
Scarce	1
tolerable;	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
north	1
to	1
call	1
Decrepit	1
winter;	1
from	1
the	1
south	1
to	1
bring	1
Solstitial	1
summer's	1
heat.	1
To	1
the	1
blanc	1
moon	1
Her	1
office	1
they	1
prescribed;	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
five	1
Their	1
planetary	1
motions,	1
and	1
aspects,	1
In	1
sextile,	1
square,	1
and	1
trine,	1
and	1
opposite,	1
Of	1
noxious	1
efficacy,	1
and	1
when	1
to	1
join	1
In	1
synod	1
unbenign;	1
and	1
taught	1
the	1
fixed	1
Their	1
influence	1
malignant	1
when	1
to	1
shower,	1
Which	1
of	1
them	1
rising	1
with	1
the	1
sun,	1
or	1
falling,	1
Should	1
prove	1
tempestuous:	1
To	1
the	1
winds	1
they	1
set	1
Their	1
corners,	1
when	1
with	1
bluster	1
to	1
confound	1
Sea,	1
air,	1
and	1
shore;	1
the	1
thunder	1
when	1
to	1
roll	1
With	1
terrour	1
through	1
the	1
dark	1
aereal	1
hall.	1
Some	1
say,	1
he	1
bid	1
his	1
Angels	1
turn	1
ascanse	1
The	1
poles	1
of	1
earth,	1
twice	1
ten	1
degrees	1
and	1
more,	1
From	1
the	1
sun's	1
axle;	1
they	1
with	1
labour	1
pushed	1
Oblique	1
the	1
centrick	1
globe:	1
Some	1
say,	1
the	1
sun	1
Was	1
bid	1
turn	1
reins	1
from	1
the	1
equinoctial	1
road	1
Like	1
distant	1
breadth	1
to	1
Taurus	1
with	1
the	1
seven	1
Atlantick	1
Sisters,	1
and	1
the	1
Spartan	1
Twins,	1
Up	1
to	1
the	1
Tropick	1
Crab:	1
thence	1
down	1
amain	1
By	1
Leo,	1
and	1
the	1
Virgin,	1
and	1
the	1
Scales,	1
As	1
deep	1
as	1
Capricorn;	1
to	1
bring	1
in	1
change	1
Of	1
seasons	1
to	1
each	1
clime;	1
else	1
had	1
the	1
spring	1
Perpetual	1
smiled	1
on	1
earth	1
with	1
vernant	1
flowers,	1
Equal	1
in	1
days	1
and	1
nights,	1
except	1
to	1
those	1
Beyond	1
the	1
polar	1
circles;	1
to	1
them	1
day	1
Had	1
unbenighted	1
shone,	1
while	1
the	1
low	1
sun,	1
To	1
recompense	1
his	1
distance,	1
in	1
their	1
sight	1
Had	1
rounded	1
still	1
the	1
horizon,	1
and	1
not	1
known	1
Or	1
east	1
or	1
west;	1
which	1
had	1
forbid	1
the	1
snow	1
From	1
cold	1
Estotiland,	1
and	1
south	1
as	1
far	1
Beneath	1
Magellan.	1
At	1
that	1
tasted	1
fruit	1
The	1
sun,	1
as	1
from	1
Thyestean	1
banquet,	1
turned	1
His	1
course	1
intended;	1
else,	1
how	1
had	1
the	1
world	1
Inhabited,	1
though	1
sinless,	1
more	1
than	1
now,	1
Avoided	1
pinching	1
cold	1
and	1
scorching	1
heat?	1
These	1
changes	1
in	1
the	1
Heavens,	1
though	1
slow,	1
produced	1
Like	1
change	1
on	1
sea	1
and	1
land;	1
sideral	1
blast,	1
Vapour,	1
and	1
mist,	1
and	1
exhalation	1
hot,	1
Corrupt	1
and	1
pestilent:	1
Now	1
from	1
the	1
north	1
Of	1
Norumbega,	1
and	1
the	1
Samoed	1
shore,	1
Bursting	1
their	1
brazen	1
dungeon,	1
armed	1
with	1
ice,	1
And	1
snow,	1
and	1
hail,	1
and	1
stormy	1
gust	1
and	1
flaw,	1
Boreas,	1
and	1
Caecias,	1
and	1
Argestes	1
loud,	1
And	1
Thrascias,	1
rend	1
the	1
woods,	1
and	1
seas	1
upturn;	1
With	1
adverse	1
blast	1
upturns	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
south	1
Notus,	1
and	1
Afer	1
black	1
with	1
thunderous	1
clouds	1
From	1
Serraliona;	1
thwart	1
of	1
these,	1
as	1
fierce,	1
Forth	1
rush	1
the	1
Levant	1
and	1
the	1
Ponent	1
winds,	1
Eurus	1
and	1
Zephyr,	1
with	1
their	1
lateral	1
noise,	1
Sirocco	1
and	1
Libecchio.	1
Thus	1
began	1
Outrage	1
from	1
lifeless	1
things;	1
but	1
Discord	1
first,	1
Daughter	1
of	1
Sin,	1
among	1
the	1
irrational	1
Death	1
introduced,	1
through	1
fierce	1
antipathy:	1
Beast	1
now	1
with	1
beast	1
'gan	1
war,	1
and	1
fowl	1
with	1
fowl,	1
And	1
fish	1
with	1
fish;	1
to	1
graze	1
the	1
herb	1
all	1
leaving,	1
Devoured	1
each	1
other;	1
nor	1
stood	1
much	1
in	1
awe	1
Of	1
Man,	1
but	1
fled	1
him;	1
or,	1
with	1
countenance	1
grim,	1
Glared	1
on	1
him	1
passing.	1
These	1
were	1
from	1
without	1
The	1
growing	1
miseries,	1
which	1
Adam	1
saw	1
Already	1
in	1
part,	1
though	1
hid	1
in	1
gloomiest	1
shade,	1
To	1
sorrow	1
abandoned,	1
but	1
worse	1
felt	1
within;	1
And,	1
in	1
a	1
troubled	1
sea	1
of	1
passion	1
tost,	1
Thus	1
to	1
disburden	1
sought	1
with	1
sad	1
complaint.	1
O	1
miserable	1
of	1
happy!	1
Is	1
this	1
the	1
end	1
Of	1
this	1
new	1
glorious	1
world,	1
and	1
me	1
so	1
late	1
The	1
glory	1
of	1
that	1
glory,	1
who	1
now	1
become	1
Accursed,	1
of	1
blessed?	1
hide	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
face	1
Of	1
God,	1
whom	1
to	1
behold	1
was	1
then	1
my	1
highth	1
Of	1
happiness!--Yet	1
well,	1
if	1
here	1
would	1
end	1
The	1
misery;	1
I	1
deserved	1
it,	1
and	1
would	1
bear	1
My	1
own	1
deservings;	1
but	1
this	1
will	1
not	1
serve:	1
All	1
that	1
I	1
eat	1
or	1
drink,	1
or	1
shall	1
beget,	1
Is	1
propagated	1
curse.	1
O	1
voice,	1
once	1
heard	1
Delightfully,	1
Encrease	1
and	1
multiply;	1
Now	1
death	1
to	1
hear!	1
for	1
what	1
can	1
I	1
encrease,	1
Or	1
multiply,	1
but	1
curses	1
on	1
my	1
head?	1
Who	1
of	1
all	1
ages	1
to	1
succeed,	1
but,	1
feeling	1
The	1
evil	1
on	1
him	1
brought	1
by	1
me,	1
will	1
curse	1
My	1
head?	1
Ill	1
fare	1
our	1
ancestor	1
impure,	1
For	1
this	1
we	1
may	1
thank	1
Adam!	1
but	1
his	1
thanks	1
Shall	1
be	1
the	1
execration:	1
so,	1
besides	1
Mine	1
own	1
that	1
bide	1
upon	1
me,	1
all	1
from	1
me	1
Shall	1
with	1
a	1
fierce	1
reflux	1
on	1
me	1
rebound;	1
On	1
me,	1
as	1
on	1
their	1
natural	1
center,	1
light	1
Heavy,	1
though	1
in	1
their	1
place.	1
O	1
fleeting	1
joys	1
Of	1
Paradise,	1
dear	1
bought	1
with	1
lasting	1
woes!	1
Did	1
I	1
request	1
thee,	1
Maker,	1
from	1
my	1
clay	1
To	1
mould	1
me	1
Man?	1
did	1
I	1
solicit	1
thee	1
From	1
darkness	1
to	1
promote	1
me,	1
or	1
here	1
place	1
In	1
this	1
delicious	1
garden?	1
As	1
my	1
will	1
Concurred	1
not	1
to	1
my	1
being,	1
it	1
were	1
but	1
right	1
And	1
equal	1
to	1
reduce	1
me	1
to	1
my	1
dust;	1
Desirous	1
to	1
resign	1
and	1
render	1
back	1
All	1
I	1
received;	1
unable	1
to	1
perform	1
Thy	1
terms	1
too	1
hard,	1
by	1
which	1
I	1
was	1
to	1
hold	1
The	1
good	1
I	1
sought	1
not.	1
To	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
that,	1
Sufficient	1
penalty,	1
why	1
hast	1
thou	1
added	1
The	1
sense	1
of	1
endless	1
woes?	1
Inexplicable	1
Why	1
am	1
I	1
mocked	1
with	1
death,	1
and	1
lengthened	1
out	1
To	1
deathless	1
pain?	1
How	1
gladly	1
would	1
I	1
meet	1
Mortality	1
my	1
sentence,	1
and	1
be	1
earth	1
Insensible!	1
How	1
glad	1
would	1
lay	1
me	1
down	1
As	1
in	1
my	1
mother's	1
lap!	1
There	1
I	1
should	1
rest,	1
And	1
sleep	1
secure;	1
his	1
dreadful	1
voice	1
no	1
more	1
Would	1
thunder	1
in	1
my	1
ears;	1
no	1
fear	1
of	1
worse	1
To	1
me,	1
and	1
to	1
my	1
offspring,	1
would	1
torment	1
me	1
With	1
cruel	1
expectation.	1
Yet	1
one	1
doubt	1
Pursues	1
me	1
still,	1
lest	1
all	1
I	1
cannot	1
die;	1
Lest	1
that	1
pure	1
breath	1
of	1
life,	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
Man	1
Which	1
God	1
inspired,	1
cannot	1
together	1
perish	1
With	1
this	1
corporeal	1
clod;	1
then,	1
in	1
the	1
grave,	1
Or	1
in	1
some	1
other	1
dismal	1
place,	1
who	1
knows	1
But	1
I	1
shall	1
die	1
a	1
living	1
death?	1
O	1
thought	1
Horrid,	1
if	1
true!	1
Yet	1
why?	1
It	1
was	1
but	1
breath	1
Of	1
life	1
that	1
sinned;	1
what	1
dies	1
but	1
what	1
had	1
life	1
And	1
sin?	1
The	1
body	1
properly	1
had	1
neither,	1
All	1
of	1
me	1
then	1
shall	1
die:	1
let	1
this	1
appease	1
The	1
doubt,	1
since	1
human	1
reach	1
no	1
further	1
knows.	1
For	1
though	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
all	1
be	1
infinite,	1
Is	1
his	1
wrath	1
also?	1
Be	1
it,	1
Man	1
is	1
not	1
so,	1
But	1
mortal	1
doomed.	1
How	1
can	1
he	1
exercise	1
Wrath	1
without	1
end	1
on	1
Man,	1
whom	1
death	1
must	1
end?	1
Can	1
he	1
make	1
deathless	1
death?	1
That	1
were	1
to	1
make	1
Strange	1
contradiction,	1
which	1
to	1
God	1
himself	1
Impossible	1
is	1
held;	1
as	1
argument	1
Of	1
weakness,	1
not	1
of	1
power.	1
Will	1
he	1
draw	1
out,	1
For	1
anger's	1
sake,	1
finite	1
to	1
infinite,	1
In	1
punished	1
Man,	1
to	1
satisfy	1
his	1
rigour,	1
Satisfied	1
never?	1
That	1
were	1
to	1
extend	1
His	1
sentence	1
beyond	1
dust	1
and	1
Nature's	1
law;	1
By	1
which	1
all	1
causes	1
else,	1
according	1
still	1
To	1
the	1
reception	1
of	1
their	1
matter,	1
act;	1
Not	1
to	1
the	1
extent	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
sphere.	1
But	1
say	1
That	1
death	1
be	1
not	1
one	1
stroke,	1
as	1
I	1
supposed,	1
Bereaving	1
sense,	1
but	1
endless	1
misery	1
From	1
this	1
day	1
onward;	1
which	1
I	1
feel	1
begun	1
Both	1
in	1
me,	1
and	1
without	1
me;	1
and	1
so	1
last	1
To	1
perpetuity;--Ay	1
me!that	1
fear	1
Comes	1
thundering	1
back	1
with	1
dreadful	1
revolution	1
On	1
my	1
defenceless	1
head;	1
both	1
Death	1
and	1
I	1
Am	1
found	1
eternal,	1
and	1
incorporate	1
both;	1
Nor	1
I	1
on	1
my	1
part	1
single;	1
in	1
me	1
all	1
Posterity	1
stands	1
cursed:	1
Fair	1
patrimony	1
That	1
I	1
must	1
leave	1
ye,	1
Sons!	1
O,	1
were	1
I	1
able	1
To	1
waste	1
it	1
all	1
myself,	1
and	1
leave	1
ye	1
none!	1
So	1
disinherited,	1
how	1
would	1
you	1
bless	1
Me,	1
now	1
your	1
curse!	1
Ah,	1
why	1
should	1
all	1
mankind,	1
For	1
one	1
man's	1
fault,	1
thus	1
guiltless	1
be	1
condemned,	1
It	1
guiltless?	1
But	1
from	1
me	1
what	1
can	1
proceed,	1
But	1
all	1
corrupt;	1
both	1
mind	1
and	1
will	1
depraved	1
Not	1
to	1
do	1
only,	1
but	1
to	1
will	1
the	1
same	1
With	1
me?	1
How	1
can	1
they	1
then	1
acquitted	1
stand	1
In	1
sight	1
of	1
God?	1
Him,	1
after	1
all	1
disputes,	1
Forced	1
I	1
absolve:	1
all	1
my	1
evasions	1
vain,	1
And	1
reasonings,	1
though	1
through	1
mazes,	1
lead	1
me	1
still	1
But	1
to	1
my	1
own	1
conviction:	1
first	1
and	1
last	1
On	1
me,	1
me	1
only,	1
as	1
the	1
source	1
and	1
spring	1
Of	1
all	1
corruption,	1
all	1
the	1
blame	1
lights	1
due;	1
So	1
might	1
the	1
wrath!	1
Fond	1
wish!couldst	1
thou	1
support	1
That	1
burden,	1
heavier	1
than	1
the	1
earth	1
to	1
bear;	1
Than	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
much	1
heavier,	1
though	1
divided	1
With	1
that	1
bad	1
Woman?	1
Thus,	1
what	1
thou	1
desirest,	1
And	1
what	1
thou	1
fearest,	1
alike	1
destroys	1
all	1
hope	1
Of	1
refuge,	1
and	1
concludes	1
thee	1
miserable	1
Beyond	1
all	1
past	1
example	1
and	1
future;	1
To	1
Satan	1
only	1
like	1
both	1
crime	1
and	1
doom.	1
O	1
Conscience!	1
into	1
what	1
abyss	1
of	1
fears	1
And	1
horrours	1
hast	1
thou	1
driven	1
me;	1
out	1
of	1
which	1
I	1
find	1
no	1
way,	1
from	1
deep	1
to	1
deeper	1
plunged!	1
Thus	1
Adam	1
to	1
himself	1
lamented	1
loud,	1
Through	1
the	1
still	1
night;	1
not	1
now,	1
as	1
ere	1
Man	1
fell,	1
Wholesome,	1
and	1
cool,	1
and	1
mild,	1
but	1
with	1
black	1
air	1
Accompanied;	1
with	1
damps,	1
and	1
dreadful	1
gloom;	1
Which	1
to	1
his	1
evil	1
conscience	1
represented	1
All	1
things	1
with	1
double	1
terrour:	1
On	1
the	1
ground	1
Outstretched	1
he	1
lay,	1
on	1
the	1
cold	1
ground;	1
and	1
oft	1
Cursed	1
his	1
creation;	1
Death	1
as	1
oft	1
accused	1
Of	1
tardy	1
execution,	1
since	1
denounced	1
The	1
day	1
of	1
his	1
offence.	1
Why	1
comes	1
not	1
Death,	1
Said	1
he,	1
with	1
one	1
thrice-acceptable	1
stroke	1
To	1
end	1
me?	1
Shall	1
Truth	1
fail	1
to	1
keep	1
her	1
word,	1
Justice	1
Divine	1
not	1
hasten	1
to	1
be	1
just?	1
But	1
Death	1
comes	1
not	1
at	1
call;	1
Justice	1
Divine	1
Mends	1
not	1
her	1
slowest	1
pace	1
for	1
prayers	1
or	1
cries,	1
O	1
woods,	1
O	1
fountains,	1
hillocks,	1
dales,	1
and	1
bowers!	1
With	1
other	1
echo	1
late	1
I	1
taught	1
your	1
shades	1
To	1
answer,	1
and	1
resound	1
far	1
other	1
song.--	1
Whom	1
thus	1
afflicted	1
when	1
sad	1
Eve	1
beheld,	1
Desolate	1
where	1
she	1
sat,	1
approaching	1
nigh,	1
Soft	1
words	1
to	1
his	1
fierce	1
passion	1
she	1
assayed:	1
But	1
her	1
with	1
stern	1
regard	1
he	1
thus	1
repelled.	1
Out	1
of	1
my	1
sight,	1
thou	1
Serpent!	1
That	1
name	1
best	1
Befits	1
thee	1
with	1
him	1
leagued,	1
thyself	1
as	1
false	1
And	1
hateful;	1
nothing	1
wants,	1
but	1
that	1
thy	1
shape,	1
Like	1
his,	1
and	1
colour	1
serpentine,	1
may	1
show	1
Thy	1
inward	1
fraud;	1
to	1
warn	1
all	1
creatures	1
from	1
thee	1
Henceforth;	1
lest	1
that	1
too	1
heavenly	1
form,	1
pretended	1
To	1
hellish	1
falshood,	1
snare	1
them!	1
But	1
for	1
thee	1
I	1
had	1
persisted	1
happy;	1
had	1
not	1
thy	1
pride	1
And	1
wandering	1
vanity,	1
when	1
least	1
was	1
safe,	1
Rejected	1
my	1
forewarning,	1
and	1
disdained	1
Not	1
to	1
be	1
trusted;	1
longing	1
to	1
be	1
seen,	1
Though	1
by	1
the	1
Devil	1
himself;	1
him	1
overweening	1
To	1
over-reach;	1
but,	1
with	1
the	1
serpent	1
meeting,	1
Fooled	1
and	1
beguiled;	1
by	1
him	1
thou,	1
I	1
by	1
thee	1
To	1
trust	1
thee	1
from	1
my	1
side;	1
imagined	1
wise,	1
Constant,	1
mature,	1
proof	1
against	1
all	1
assaults;	1
And	1
understood	1
not	1
all	1
was	1
but	1
a	1
show,	1
Rather	1
than	1
solid	1
virtue;	1
all	1
but	1
a	1
rib	1
Crooked	1
by	1
nature,	1
bent,	1
as	1
now	1
appears,	1
More	1
to	1
the	1
part	1
sinister,	1
from	1
me	1
drawn;	1
Well	1
if	1
thrown	1
out,	1
as	1
supernumerary	1
To	1
my	1
just	1
number	1
found.	1
O!	1
why	1
did	1
God,	1
Creator	1
wise,	1
that	1
peopled	1
highest	1
Heaven	1
With	1
Spirits	1
masculine,	1
create	1
at	1
last	1
This	1
novelty	1
on	1
earth,	1
this	1
fair	1
defect	1
Of	1
nature,	1
and	1
not	1
fill	1
the	1
world	1
at	1
once	1
With	1
Men,	1
as	1
Angels,	1
without	1
feminine;	1
Or	1
find	1
some	1
other	1
way	1
to	1
generate	1
Mankind?	1
This	1
mischief	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
befallen,	1
And	1
more	1
that	1
shall	1
befall;	1
innumerable	1
Disturbances	1
on	1
earth	1
through	1
female	1
snares,	1
And	1
strait	1
conjunction	1
with	1
this	1
sex:	1
for	1
either	1
He	1
never	1
shall	1
find	1
out	1
fit	1
mate,	1
but	1
such	1
As	1
some	1
misfortune	1
brings	1
him,	1
or	1
mistake;	1
Or	1
whom	1
he	1
wishes	1
most	1
shall	1
seldom	1
gain	1
Through	1
her	1
perverseness,	1
but	1
shall	1
see	1
her	1
gained	1
By	1
a	1
far	1
worse;	1
or,	1
if	1
she	1
love,	1
withheld	1
By	1
parents;	1
or	1
his	1
happiest	1
choice	1
too	1
late	1
Shall	1
meet,	1
already	1
linked	1
and	1
wedlock-bound	1
To	1
a	1
fell	1
adversary,	1
his	1
hate	1
or	1
shame:	1
Which	1
infinite	1
calamity	1
shall	1
cause	1
To	1
human	1
life,	1
and	1
houshold	1
peace	1
confound.	1
He	1
added	1
not,	1
and	1
from	1
her	1
turned;	1
but	1
Eve,	1
Not	1
so	1
repulsed,	1
with	1
tears	1
that	1
ceased	1
not	1
flowing	1
And	1
tresses	1
all	1
disordered,	1
at	1
his	1
feet	1
Fell	1
humble;	1
and,	1
embracing	1
them,	1
besought	1
His	1
peace,	1
and	1
thus	1
proceeded	1
in	1
her	1
plaint.	1
Forsake	1
me	1
not	1
thus,	1
Adam!	1
witness	1
Heaven	1
What	1
love	1
sincere,	1
and	1
reverence	1
in	1
my	1
heart	1
I	1
bear	1
thee,	1
and	1
unweeting	1
have	1
offended,	1
Unhappily	1
deceived!	1
Thy	1
suppliant	1
I	1
beg,	1
and	1
clasp	1
thy	1
knees;	1
bereave	1
me	1
not,	1
Whereon	1
I	1
live,	1
thy	1
gentle	1
looks,	1
thy	1
aid,	1
Thy	1
counsel,	1
in	1
this	1
uttermost	1
distress,	1
My	1
only	1
strength	1
and	1
stay:	1
Forlorn	1
of	1
thee,	1
Whither	1
shall	1
I	1
betake	1
me,	1
where	1
subsist?	1
While	1
yet	1
we	1
live,	1
scarce	1
one	1
short	1
hour	1
perhaps,	1
Between	1
us	1
two	1
let	1
there	1
be	1
peace;	1
both	1
joining,	1
As	1
joined	1
in	1
injuries,	1
one	1
enmity	1
Against	1
a	1
foe	1
by	1
doom	1
express	1
assigned	1
us,	1
That	1
cruel	1
Serpent:	1
On	1
me	1
exercise	1
not	1
Thy	1
hatred	1
for	1
this	1
misery	1
befallen;	1
On	1
me	1
already	1
lost,	1
me	1
than	1
thyself	1
More	1
miserable!	1
Both	1
have	1
sinned;but	1
thou	1
Against	1
God	1
only;	1
I	1
against	1
God	1
and	1
thee;	1
And	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
judgement	1
will	1
return,	1
There	1
with	1
my	1
cries	1
importune	1
Heaven;	1
that	1
all	1
The	1
sentence,	1
from	1
thy	1
head	1
removed,	1
may	1
light	1
On	1
me,	1
sole	1
cause	1
to	1
thee	1
of	1
all	1
this	1
woe;	1
Me,	1
me	1
only,	1
just	1
object	1
of	1
his	1
ire!	1
She	1
ended	1
weeping;	1
and	1
her	1
lowly	1
plight,	1
Immoveable,	1
till	1
peace	1
obtained	1
from	1
fault	1
Acknowledged	1
and	1
deplored,	1
in	1
Adam	1
wrought	1
Commiseration:	1
Soon	1
his	1
heart	1
relented	1
Towards	1
her,	1
his	1
life	1
so	1
late,	1
and	1
sole	1
delight,	1
Now	1
at	1
his	1
feet	1
submissive	1
in	1
distress;	1
Creature	1
so	1
fair	1
his	1
reconcilement	1
seeking,	1
His	1
counsel,	1
whom	1
she	1
had	1
displeased,	1
his	1
aid:	1
As	1
one	1
disarmed,	1
his	1
anger	1
all	1
he	1
lost,	1
And	1
thus	1
with	1
peaceful	1
words	1
upraised	1
her	1
soon.	1
Unwary,	1
and	1
too	1
desirous,	1
as	1
before,	1
So	1
now	1
of	1
what	1
thou	1
knowest	1
not,	1
who	1
desirest	1
The	1
punishment	1
all	1
on	1
thyself;	1
alas!	1
Bear	1
thine	1
own	1
first,	1
ill	1
able	1
to	1
sustain	1
His	1
full	1
wrath,	1
whose	1
thou	1
feelest	1
as	1
yet	1
least	1
part,	1
And	1
my	1
displeasure	1
bearest	1
so	1
ill.	1
If	1
prayers	1
Could	1
alter	1
high	1
decrees,	1
I	1
to	1
that	1
place	1
Would	1
speed	1
before	1
thee,	1
and	1
be	1
louder	1
heard,	1
That	1
on	1
my	1
head	1
all	1
might	1
be	1
visited;	1
Thy	1
frailty	1
and	1
infirmer	1
sex	1
forgiven,	1
To	1
me	1
committed,	1
and	1
by	1
me	1
exposed.	1
But	1
rise;--let	1
us	1
no	1
more	1
contend,	1
nor	1
blame	1
Each	1
other,	1
blamed	1
enough	1
elsewhere;	1
but	1
strive	1
In	1
offices	1
of	1
love,	1
how	1
we	1
may	1
lighten	1
Each	1
other's	1
burden,	1
in	1
our	1
share	1
of	1
woe;	1
Since	1
this	1
day's	1
death	1
denounced,	1
if	1
aught	1
I	1
see,	1
Will	1
prove	1
no	1
sudden,	1
but	1
a	1
slow-paced	1
evil;	1
A	1
long	1
day's	1
dying,	1
to	1
augment	1
our	1
pain;	1
And	1
to	1
our	1
seed	1
(O	1
hapless	1
seed!)	1
derived.	1
To	1
whom	1
thus	1
Eve,	1
recovering	1
heart,	1
replied.	1
Adam,	1
by	1
sad	1
experiment	1
I	1
know	1
How	1
little	1
weight	1
my	1
words	1
with	1
thee	1
can	1
find,	1
Found	1
so	1
erroneous;	1
thence	1
by	1
just	1
event	1
Found	1
so	1
unfortunate:	1
Nevertheless,	1
Restored	1
by	1
thee,	1
vile	1
as	1
I	1
am,	1
to	1
place	1
Of	1
new	1
acceptance,	1
hopeful	1
to	1
regain	1
Thy	1
love,	1
the	1
sole	1
contentment	1
of	1
my	1
heart	1
Living	1
or	1
dying,	1
from	1
thee	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
hide	1
What	1
thoughts	1
in	1
my	1
unquiet	1
breast	1
are	1
risen,	1
Tending	1
to	1
some	1
relief	1
of	1
our	1
extremes,	1
Or	1
end;	1
though	1
sharp	1
and	1
sad,	1
yet	1
tolerable,	1
As	1
in	1
our	1
evils,	1
and	1
of	1
easier	1
choice.	1
If	1
care	1
of	1
our	1
descent	1
perplex	1
us	1
most,	1
Which	1
must	1
be	1
born	1
to	1
certain	1
woe,	1
devoured	1
By	1
Death	1
at	1
last;	1
and	1
miserable	1
it	1
is	1
To	1
be	1
to	1
others	1
cause	1
of	1
misery,	1
Our	1
own	1
begotten,	1
and	1
of	1
our	1
loins	1
to	1
bring	1
Into	1
this	1
cursed	1
world	1
a	1
woeful	1
race,	1
That	1
after	1
wretched	1
life	1
must	1
be	1
at	1
last	1
Food	1
for	1
so	1
foul	1
a	1
monster;	1
in	1
thy	1
power	1
It	1
lies,	1
yet	1
ere	1
conception	1
to	1
prevent	1
The	1
race	1
unblest,	1
to	1
being	1
yet	1
unbegot.	1
Childless	1
thou	1
art,	1
childless	1
remain:	1
so	1
Death	1
Shall	1
be	1
deceived	1
his	1
glut,	1
and	1
with	1
us	1
two	1
Be	1
forced	1
to	1
satisfy	1
his	1
ravenous	1
maw.	1
But	1
if	1
thou	1
judge	1
it	1
hard	1
and	1
difficult,	1
Conversing,	1
looking,	1
loving,	1
to	1
abstain	1
From	1
love's	1
due	1
rights,	1
nuptial	1
embraces	1
sweet;	1
And	1
with	1
desire	1
to	1
languish	1
without	1
hope,	1
Before	1
the	1
present	1
object	1
languishing	1
With	1
like	1
desire;	1
which	1
would	1
be	1
misery	1
And	1
torment	1
less	1
than	1
none	1
of	1
what	1
we	1
dread;	1
Then,	1
both	1
ourselves	1
and	1
seed	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
free	1
From	1
what	1
we	1
fear	1
for	1
both,	1
let	1
us	1
make	1
short,	1
--	1
Let	1
us	1
seek	1
Death;	1
--	1
or,	1
he	1
not	1
found,	1
supply	1
With	1
our	1
own	1
hands	1
his	1
office	1
on	1
ourselves:	1
Why	1
stand	1
we	1
longer	1
shivering	1
under	1
fears,	1
That	1
show	1
no	1
end	1
but	1
death,	1
and	1
have	1
the	1
power,	1
Of	1
many	1
ways	1
to	1
die	1
the	1
shortest	1
choosing,	1
Destruction	1
with	1
destruction	1
to	1
destroy?	1
--	1
She	1
ended	1
here,	1
or	1
vehement	1
despair	1
Broke	1
off	1
the	1
rest:	1
so	1
much	1
of	1
death	1
her	1
thoughts	1
Had	1
entertained,	1
as	1
dyed	1
her	1
cheeks	1
with	1
pale.	1
But	1
Adam,	1
with	1
such	1
counsel	1
nothing	1
swayed,	1
To	1
better	1
hopes	1
his	1
more	1
attentive	1
mind	1
Labouring	1
had	1
raised;	1
and	1
thus	1
to	1
Eve	1
replied.	1
Eve,	1
thy	1
contempt	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
pleasure	1
seems	1
To	1
argue	1
in	1
thee	1
something	1
more	1
sublime	1
And	1
excellent,	1
than	1
what	1
thy	1
mind	1
contemns;	1
But	1
self-destruction	1
therefore	1
sought,	1
refutes	1
That	1
excellence	1
thought	1
in	1
thee;	1
and	1
implies,	1
Not	1
thy	1
contempt,	1
but	1
anguish	1
and	1
regret	1
For	1
loss	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
pleasure	1
overloved.	1
Or	1
if	1
thou	1
covet	1
death,	1
as	1
utmost	1
end	1
Of	1
misery,	1
so	1
thinking	1
to	1
evade	1
The	1
penalty	1
pronounced;	1
doubt	1
not	1
but	1
God	1
Hath	1
wiselier	1
armed	1
his	1
vengeful	1
ire,	1
than	1
so	1
To	1
be	1
forestalled;	1
much	1
more	1
I	1
fear	1
lest	1
death,	1
So	1
snatched,	1
will	1
not	1
exempt	1
us	1
from	1
the	1
pain	1
We	1
are	1
by	1
doom	1
to	1
pay;	1
rather,	1
such	1
acts	1
Of	1
contumacy	1
will	1
provoke	1
the	1
Highest	1
To	1
make	1
death	1
in	1
us	1
live:	1
Then	1
let	1
us	1
seek	1
Some	1
safer	1
resolution,	1
which	1
methinks	1
I	1
have	1
in	1
view,	1
calling	1
to	1
mind	1
with	1
heed	1
Part	1
of	1
our	1
sentence,	1
that	1
thy	1
seed	1
shall	1
bruise	1
The	1
Serpent's	1
head;	1
piteous	1
amends!	1
unless	1
Be	1
meant,	1
whom	1
I	1
conjecture,	1
our	1
grand	1
foe,	1
Satan;	1
who,	1
in	1
the	1
serpent,	1
hath	1
contrived	1
Against	1
us	1
this	1
deceit:	1
To	1
crush	1
his	1
head	1
Would	1
be	1
revenge	1
indeed!	1
which	1
will	1
be	1
lost	1
By	1
death	1
brought	1
on	1
ourselves,	1
or	1
childless	1
days	1
Resolved,	1
as	1
thou	1
proposest;	1
so	1
our	1
foe	1
Shal	1
'scape	1
his	1
punishment	1
ordained,	1
and	1
we	1
Instead	1
shall	1
double	1
ours	1
upon	1
our	1
heads.	1
No	1
more	1
be	1
mentioned	1
then	1
of	1
violence	1
Against	1
ourselves;	1
and	1
wilful	1
barrenness,	1
That	1
cuts	1
us	1
off	1
from	1
hope;	1
and	1
savours	1
only	1
Rancour	1
and	1
pride,	1
impatience	1
and	1
despite,	1
Reluctance	1
against	1
God	1
and	1
his	1
just	1
yoke	1
Laid	1
on	1
our	1
necks.	1
Remember	1
with	1
what	1
mild	1
And	1
gracious	1
temper	1
he	1
both	1
heard,	1
and	1
judged,	1
Without	1
wrath	1
or	1
reviling;	1
we	1
expected	1
Immediate	1
dissolution,	1
which	1
we	1
thought	1
Was	1
meant	1
by	1
death	1
that	1
day;	1
when	1
lo!to	1
thee	1
Pains	1
only	1
in	1
child-bearing	1
were	1
foretold,	1
And	1
bringing	1
forth;	1
soon	1
recompensed	1
with	1
joy,	1
Fruit	1
of	1
thy	1
womb:	1
On	1
me	1
the	1
curse	1
aslope	1
Glanced	1
on	1
the	1
ground;	1
with	1
labour	1
I	1
must	1
earn	1
My	1
bread;	1
what	1
harm?	1
Idleness	1
had	1
been	1
worse;	1
My	1
labour	1
will	1
sustain	1
me;	1
and,	1
lest	1
cold	1
Or	1
heat	1
should	1
injure	1
us,	1
his	1
timely	1
care	1
Hath,	1
unbesought,	1
provided;	1
and	1
his	1
hands	1
Clothed	1
us	1
unworthy,	1
pitying	1
while	1
he	1
judged;	1
How	1
much	1
more,	1
if	1
we	1
pray	1
him,	1
will	1
his	1
ear	1
Be	1
open,	1
and	1
his	1
heart	1
to	1
pity	1
incline,	1
And	1
teach	1
us	1
further	1
by	1
what	1
means	1
to	1
shun	1
The	1
inclement	1
seasons,	1
rain,	1
ice,	1
hail,	1
and	1
snow!	1
Which	1
now	1
the	1
sky,	1
with	1
various	1
face,	1
begins	1
To	1
show	1
us	1
in	1
this	1
mountain;	1
while	1
the	1
winds	1
Blow	1
moist	1
and	1
keen,	1
shattering	1
the	1
graceful	1
locks	1
Of	1
these	1
fair	1
spreading	1
trees;	1
which	1
bids	1
us	1
seek	1
Some	1
better	1
shroud,	1
some	1
better	1
warmth	1
to	1
cherish	1
Our	1
limbs	1
benummed,	1

Book	1
XI	1
Undoubtedly	1
he	1
will	1
relent,	1
and	1
turn	1
From	1
his	1
displeasure;	1
in	1
whose	1
look	1
serene,	1
When	1
angry	1
most	1
he	1
seemed	1
and	1
most	1
severe,	1
What	1
else	1
but	1
favour,	1
grace,	1
and	1
mercy,	1
shone?	1
So	1
spake	1
our	1
father	1
penitent;	1
nor	1
Eve	1
Felt	1
less	1
remorse:	1
they,	1
forthwith	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
Repairing	1
where	1
he	1
judged	1
them,	1
prostrate	1
fell	1
Before	1
him	1
reverent;	1
and	1
both	1
confessed	1
Humbly	1
their	1
faults,	1
and	1
pardon	1

with	1

from	1
hearts	1
contrite,	1
in	1
sign	1
Of	1
sorrow	1
unfeigned,	1
and	1
humiliation	1
meek.	1
Thus	1
they,	1
in	1
lowliest	1
plight,	1
repentant	1
stood	1
Praying;	1
for	1
from	1
the	1
mercy-seat	1
above	1
Prevenient	1
grace	1
descending	1
had	1
removed	1
The	1
stony	1
from	1
their	1
hearts,	1
and	1
made	1
new	1
flesh	1
Regenerate	1
grow	1
instead;	1
that	1
sighs	1
now	1
breathed	1
Unutterable;	1
which	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
prayer	1
Inspired,	1
and	1
winged	1
for	1
Heaven	1
with	1
speedier	1

Than	1

Yet	1
their	1

Not	1
of	1
mean	1

Seemed	1
their	1

In	1

Dimensionless	1
through	1
heavenly	1
doors;	1
then	1
clad	1
With	1
incense,	1
where	1
the	1
golden	1
altar	1
fumed,	1
By	1
their	1
great	1
intercessour,	1
came	1
in	1

what	1

From	1
thy	1

in	1
this	1
golden	1
censer	1
mixed	1
With	1
incense,	1
I	1
thy	1

Sown	1
with	1
contrition	1
in	1

his	1
own	1
hand	1
manuring,	1
all	1
the	1
trees	1
Of	1
Paradise	1
could	1
have	1
produced,	1
ere	1
fallen	1
From	1
innocence.	1
Now	1
therefore,	1
bend	1
thine	1
ear	1
To	1
supplication;	1
hear	1
his	1
sighs,	1
though	1
mute;	1
Unskilful	1
with	1
what	1
words	1
to	1
pray,	1
let	1
me	1
Interpret	1
for	1
him;	1
me,	1
his	1
advocate	1
And	1
propitiation;	1
all	1
his	1
works	1
on	1
me,	1
Good,	1
or	1
not	1
good,	1
ingraft;	1
my	1
merit	1
those	1
Shall	1
perfect,	1
and	1
for	1
these	1
my	1
death	1
shall	1
pay.	1
Accept	1
me;	1
and,	1
in	1
me,	1
from	1
these	1
receive	1
The	1
smell	1
of	1
peace	1
toward	1
mankind:	1
let	1
him	1
live	1
Before	1
thee	1
reconciled,	1
at	1
least	1
his	1
days	1
Numbered,	1
though	1
sad;	1
till	1
death,	1
his	1
doom,	1
(which	1
I	1
To	1
mitigate	1
thus	1
plead,	1
not	1
to	1
reverse,)	1
To	1
better	1
life	1
shall	1
yield	1
him:	1
where	1
with	1
me	1
All	1
my	1
redeemed	1
may	1
dwell	1
in	1
joy	1
and	1
bliss;	1
Made	1
one	1
with	1
me,	1
as	1
I	1
with	1
thee	1
am	1
one.	1
To	1
whom	1
the	1
Father,	1
without	1
cloud,	1
serene.	1
All	1
thy	1
request	1
for	1
Man,	1
accepted	1
Son,	1
Obtain;	1
all	1
thy	1
request	1
was	1
my	1
decree:	1
But,	1
longer	1
in	1
that	1
Paradise	1
to	1
dwell,	1
The	1
law	1
I	1
gave	1
to	1
Nature	1
him	1
forbids:	1
Those	1
pure	1
immortal	1
elements,	1
that	1
know,	1
No	1
gross,	1
no	1
unharmonious	1
mixture	1
foul,	1
Eject	1
him,	1
tainted	1
now;	1
and	1
purge	1
him	1
off,	1
As	1
a	1
distemper,	1
gross,	1
to	1
air	1
as	1
gross,	1
And	1
mortal	1
food;	1
as	1
may	1
dispose	1
him	1
best	1
For	1
dissolution	1
wrought	1
by	1
sin,	1
that	1
first	1
Distempered	1
all	1
things,	1
and	1
of	1
incorrupt	1
Corrupted.	1
I,	1
at	1
first,	1
with	1
two	1
fair	1
gifts	1
Created	1
him	1
endowed;	1
with	1
happiness,	1
And	1
immortality:	1
that	1
fondly	1
lost,	1
This	1
other	1
served	1
but	1
to	1
eternize	1
woe;	1
Till	1
I	1
provided	1
death:	1
so	1
death	1
becomes	1
His	1
final	1
remedy;	1
and,	1
after	1
life,	1
Tried	1
in	1
sharp	1
tribulation,	1
and	1
refined	1
By	1
faith	1
and	1
faithful	1
works,	1
to	1
second	1
life,	1
Waked	1
in	1
the	1
renovation	1
of	1
the	1
just,	1
Resigns	1
him	1
up	1
with	1
Heaven	1
and	1
Earth	1
renewed.	1
But	1
let	1
us	1
call	1
to	1
synod	1
all	1
the	1
Blest,	1
Through	1
Heaven's	1
wide	1
bounds:	1
from	1
them	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
hide	1
My	1
judgements;	1
how	1
with	1
mankind	1
I	1
proceed,	1
As	1
how	1
with	1
peccant	1
Angels	1
late	1
they	1
saw,	1
And	1
in	1
their	1
state,	1
though	1
firm,	1
stood	1
more	1
confirmed.	1
He	1
ended,	1
and	1
the	1
Son	1
gave	1
signal	1
high	1
To	1
the	1
bright	1
minister	1
that	1
watched;	1
he	1
blew	1
His	1
trumpet,	1
heard	1
in	1
Oreb	1
since	1
perhaps	1
When	1
God	1
descended,	1
and	1
perhaps	1
once	1
more	1
To	1
sound	1
at	1
general	1
doom.	1
The	1
angelick	1
blast	1
Filled	1
all	1
the	1
regions:	1
from	1
their	1
blisful	1
bowers	1
Of	1
amarantine	1
shade,	1
fountain	1
or	1
spring,	1
By	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
life,	1
where'er	1
they	1
sat	1
In	1
fellowships	1
of	1
joy,	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
light	1
Hasted,	1
resorting	1
to	1
the	1
summons	1
high;	1
And	1
took	1
their	1
seats;	1
till	1
from	1
his	1
throne	1
supreme	1
The	1
Almighty	1
thus	1
pronounced	1
his	1
sovran	1
will.	1
O	1
Sons,	1
like	1
one	1
of	1
us	1
Man	1
is	1
become	1
To	1
know	1
both	1
good	1
and	1
evil,	1
since	1
his	1
taste	1
Of	1
that	1
defended	1
fruit;	1
but	1
let	1
him	1
boast	1
His	1
knowledge	1
of	1
good	1
lost,	1
and	1
evil	1
got;	1
Happier!	1
had	1
it	1
sufficed	1
him	1
to	1
have	1
known	1
Good	1
by	1
itself,	1
and	1
evil	1
not	1
at	1
all.	1
He	1
sorrows	1
now,	1
repents,	1
and	1
prays	1
contrite,	1
My	1
motions	1
in	1
him;	1
longer	1
than	1
they	1
move,	1
His	1
heart	1
I	1
know,	1
how	1
variable	1
and	1
vain,	1
Self-left.	1
Lest	1
therefore	1
his	1
now	1
bolder	1
hand	1
Reach	1
also	1
of	1
the	1
tree	1
of	1
life,	1
and	1
eat,	1
And	1
live	1
for	1
ever,	1
dream	1
at	1
least	1
to	1
live	1
For	1
ever,	1
to	1
remove	1
him	1
I	1
decree,	1
And	1
send	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
garden	1
forth	1
to	1
till	1
The	1
ground	1
whence	1
he	1
was	1
taken,	1
fitter	1
soil.	1
Michael,	1
this	1
my	1
behest	1
have	1
thou	1
in	1
charge;	1
Take	1
to	1
thee	1
from	1
among	1
the	1
Cherubim	1
Thy	1
choice	1
of	1
flaming	1
warriours,	1
lest	1
the	1
Fiend,	1
Or	1
in	1
behalf	1
of	1
Man,	1
or	1
to	1
invade	1
Vacant	1
possession,	1
some	1
new	1
trouble	1
raise:	1
Haste	1
thee,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
Paradise	1
of	1
God	1
Without	1
remorse	1
drive	1
out	1
the	1
sinful	1
pair;	1
From	1
hallowed	1
ground	1
the	1
unholy;	1
and	1
denounce	1
To	1
them,	1
and	1
to	1
their	1
progeny,	1
from	1
thence	1
Perpetual	1
banishment.	1
Yet,	1
lest	1
they	1
faint	1
At	1
the	1
sad	1
sentence	1
rigorously	1
urged,	1
(For	1
I	1
behold	1
them	1
softened,	1
and	1
with	1
tears	1
Bewailing	1
their	1
excess,)	1
all	1
terrour	1
hide.	1
If	1
patiently	1
thy	1
bidding	1
they	1
obey,	1
Dismiss	1
them	1
not	1
disconsolate;	1
reveal	1
To	1
Adam	1
what	1
shall	1
come	1
in	1
future	1
days,	1
As	1
I	1
shall	1
thee	1
enlighten;	1
intermix	1
My	1
covenant	1
in	1
the	1
Woman's	1
seed	1
renewed;	1
So	1
send	1
them	1
forth,	1
though	1
sorrowing,	1
yet	1
in	1
peace:	1
And	1
on	1
the	1
east	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
garden	1
place,	1
Where	1
entrance	1
up	1
from	1
Eden	1
easiest	1
climbs,	1
Cherubick	1
watch;	1
and	1
of	1
a	1
sword	1
the	1
flame	1
Wide-waving;	1
all	1
approach	1
far	1
off	1
to	1
fright,	1
And	1
guard	1
all	1
passage	1
to	1
the	1
tree	1
of	1
life:	1
Lest	1
Paradise	1
a	1
receptacle	1
prove	1
To	1
Spirits	1
foul,	1
and	1
all	1
my	1
trees	1
their	1
prey;	1
With	1
whose	1
stolen	1
fruit	1
Man	1
once	1
more	1
to	1
delude.	1
He	1
ceased;	1
and	1
the	1
arch-angelick	1
Power	1
prepared	1
For	1
swift	1
descent;	1
with	1
him	1
the	1
cohort	1
bright	1
Of	1
watchful	1
Cherubim:	1
four	1
faces	1
each	1
Had,	1
like	1
a	1
double	1
Janus;	1
all	1
their	1
shape	1
Spangled	1
with	1
eyes	1
more	1
numerous	1
than	1
those	1
Of	1
Argus,	1
and	1
more	1
wakeful	1
than	1
to	1
drouse,	1
Charmed	1
with	1
Arcadian	1
pipe,	1
the	1
pastoral	1
reed	1
Of	1
Hermes,	1
or	1
his	1
opiate	1
rod.	1
Mean	1
while,	1
To	1
re-salute	1
the	1
world	1
with	1
sacred	1
light,	1
Leucothea	1
waked;	1
and	1
with	1
fresh	1
dews	1
imbalmed	1
The	1
earth;	1
when	1
Adam	1
and	1
first	1
matron	1
Eve	1
Had	1
ended	1
now	1
their	1
orisons,	1
and	1
found	1
Strength	1
added	1
from	1
above;	1
new	1
hope	1
to	1
spring	1
Out	1
of	1
despair;	1
joy,	1
but	1
with	1
fear	1
yet	1
linked;	1
Which	1
thus	1
to	1
Eve	1
his	1
welcome	1
words	1
renewed.	1
Eve,	1
easily	1
my	1
faith	1
admit,	1
that	1
all	1
The	1
good	1
which	1
we	1
enjoy	1
from	1
Heaven	1
descends;	1
But,	1
that	1
from	1
us	1
aught	1
should	1
ascend	1
to	1
Heaven	1
So	1
prevalent	1
as	1
to	1
concern	1
the	1
mind	1
Of	1
God	1
high-blest,	1
or	1
to	1
incline	1
his	1
will,	1
Hard	1
to	1
belief	1
may	1
seem;	1
yet	1
this	1
will	1
prayer	1
Or	1
one	1
short	1
sigh	1
of	1
human	1
breath,	1
upborne	1
Even	1
to	1
the	1
seat	1
of	1
God.	1
For	1
since	1
I	1
sought	1
By	1
prayer	1
the	1
offended	1
Deity	1
to	1
appease;	1
Kneeled,	1
and	1
before	1
him	1
humbled	1
all	1
my	1
heart;	1
Methought	1
I	1
saw	1
him	1
placable	1
and	1
mild,	1
Bending	1
his	1
ear;	1
persuasion	1
in	1
me	1
grew	1
That	1
I	1
was	1
heard	1
with	1
favour;	1
peace	1
returned	1
Home	1
to	1
my	1
breast,	1
and	1
to	1
my	1
memory	1
His	1
promise,	1
that	1
thy	1
seed	1
shall	1
bruise	1
our	1
foe;	1
Which,	1
then	1
not	1
minded	1
in	1
dismay,	1
yet	1
now	1
Assures	1
me	1
that	1
the	1
bitterness	1
of	1
death	1
Is	1
past,	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
live.	1
Whence	1
hail	1
to	1
thee,	1
Eve	1
rightly	1
called,	1
mother	1
of	1
all	1
mankind,	1
Mother	1
of	1
all	1
things	1
living,	1
since	1
by	1
thee	1
Man	1
is	1
to	1
live;	1
and	1
all	1
things	1
live	1
for	1
Man.	1
To	1
whom	1
thus	1
Eve	1
with	1
sad	1
demeanour	1
meek.	1
Ill-worthy	1
I	1
such	1
title	1
should	1
belong	1
To	1
me	1
transgressour;	1
who,	1
for	1
thee	1
ordained	1
A	1
help,	1
became	1
thy	1
snare;	1
to	1
me	1
reproach	1
Rather	1
belongs,	1
distrust,	1
and	1
all	1
dispraise:	1
But	1
infinite	1
in	1
pardon	1
was	1
my	1
Judge,	1
That	1
I,	1
who	1
first	1
brought	1
death	1
on	1
all,	1
am	1
graced	1
The	1
source	1
of	1
life;	1
next	1
favourable	1
thou,	1
Who	1
highly	1
thus	1
to	1
entitle	1
me	1
vouchsaf'st,	1
Far	1
other	1
name	1
deserving.	1
But	1
the	1
field	1
To	1
labour	1
calls	1
us,	1
now	1
with	1
sweat	1
imposed,	1
Though	1
after	1
sleepless	1
night;	1
for	1
see!the	1
morn,	1
All	1
unconcerned	1
with	1
our	1
unrest,	1
begins	1
Her	1
rosy	1
progress	1
smiling:	1
let	1
us	1
forth;	1
I	1
never	1
from	1
thy	1
side	1
henceforth	1
to	1
stray,	1
Where'er	1
our	1
day's	1
work	1
lies,	1
though	1
now	1
enjoined	1
Laborious,	1
till	1
day	1
droop;	1
while	1
here	1
we	1
dwell,	1
What	1
can	1
be	1
toilsome	1
in	1
these	1
pleasant	1
walks?	1
Here	1
let	1
us	1
live,	1
though	1
in	1
fallen	1
state,	1
content.	1
So	1
spake,	1
so	1
wished	1
much	1
humbled	1
Eve;	1
but	1
Fate	1
Subscribed	1
not:	1
Nature	1
first	1
gave	1
signs,	1
impressed	1
On	1
bird,	1
beast,	1
air;	1
air	1
suddenly	1
eclipsed,	1
After	1
short	1
blush	1
of	1
morn;	1
nigh	1
in	1
her	1
sight	1
The	1
bird	1
of	1
Jove,	1
stooped	1
from	1
his	1
aery	1
tour,	1
Two	1
birds	1
of	1
gayest	1
plume	1
before	1
him	1
drove;	1
Down	1
from	1
a	1
hill	1
the	1
beast	1
that	1
reigns	1
in	1
woods,	1
First	1
hunter	1
then,	1
pursued	1
a	1
gentle	1
brace,	1
Goodliest	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
forest,	1
hart	1
and	1
hind;	1
Direct	1
to	1
the	1
eastern	1
gate	1
was	1
bent	1
their	1
flight.	1
Adam	1
observed,	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
eye	1
the	1
chase	1
Pursuing,	1
not	1
unmoved,	1
to	1
Eve	1
thus	1
spake.	1
O	1
Eve,	1
some	1
further	1
change	1
awaits	1
us	1
nigh,	1
Which	1
Heaven,	1
by	1
these	1
mute	1
signs	1
in	1
Nature,	1
shows	1
Forerunners	1
of	1
his	1
purpose;	1
or	1
to	1
warn	1
Us,	1
haply	1
too	1
secure,	1
of	1
our	1
discharge	1
From	1
penalty,	1
because	1
from	1
death	1
released	1
Some	1
days:	1
how	1
long,	1
and	1
what	1
till	1
then	1
our	1
life,	1
Who	1
knows?	1
or	1
more	1
than	1
this,	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
dust,	1
And	1
thither	1
must	1
return,	1
and	1
be	1
no	1
more?	1
Why	1
else	1
this	1
double	1
object	1
in	1
our	1
sight	1
Of	1
flight	1
pursued	1
in	1
the	1
air,	1
and	1
o'er	1
the	1
ground,	1
One	1
way	1
the	1
self-same	1
hour?	1
why	1
in	1
the	1
east	1
Darkness	1
ere	1
day's	1
mid-course,	1
and	1
morning-light	1
More	1
orient	1
in	1
yon	1
western	1
cloud,	1
that	1
draws	1
O'er	1
the	1
blue	1
firmament	1
a	1
radiant	1
white,	1
And	1
slow	1
descends	1
with	1
something	1
heavenly	1
fraught?	1
He	1
erred	1
not;	1
for	1
by	1
this	1
the	1
heavenly	1
bands	1
Down	1
from	1
a	1
sky	1
of	1
jasper	1
lighted	1
now	1
In	1
Paradise,	1
and	1
on	1
a	1
hill	1
made	1
halt;	1
A	1
glorious	1
apparition,	1
had	1
not	1
doubt	1
And	1
carnal	1
fear	1
that	1
day	1
dimmed	1
Adam's	1
eye.	1
Not	1
that	1
more	1
glorious,	1
when	1
the	1
Angels	1
met	1
Jacob	1
in	1
Mahanaim,	1
where	1
he	1
saw	1
The	1
field	1
pavilioned	1
with	1
his	1
guardians	1
bright;	1
Nor	1
that,	1
which	1
on	1
the	1
flaming	1
mount	1
appeared	1
In	1
Dothan,	1
covered	1
with	1
a	1
camp	1
of	1
fire,	1
Against	1
the	1
Syrian	1
king,	1
who	1
to	1
surprise	1
One	1
man,	1
assassin-like,	1
had	1
levied	1
war,	1
War	1
unproclaimed.	1
The	1
princely	1
Hierarch	1
In	1
their	1
bright	1
stand	1
there	1
left	1
his	1
Powers,	1
to	1
seise	1
Possession	1
of	1
the	1
garden;	1
he	1
alone,	1
To	1
find	1
where	1
Adam	1
sheltered,	1
took	1
his	1
way,	1
Not	1
unperceived	1
of	1
Adam;	1
who	1
to	1
Eve,	1
While	1
the	1
great	1
visitant	1
approached,	1
thus	1
spake.	1
Eve$	1
now	1
expect	1
great	1
tidings,	1
which	1
perhaps	1
Of	1
us	1
will	1
soon	1
determine,	1
or	1
impose	1
New	1
laws	1
to	1
be	1
observed;	1
for	1
I	1
descry,	1
From	1
yonder	1
blazing	1
cloud	1
that	1
veils	1
the	1
hill,	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
heavenly	1
host;	1
and,	1
by	1
his	1
gait,	1
None	1
of	1
the	1
meanest;	1
some	1
great	1
Potentate	1
Or	1
of	1
the	1
Thrones	1
above;	1
such	1
majesty	1
Invests	1
him	1
coming!	1
yet	1
not	1
terrible,	1
That	1
I	1
should	1
fear;	1
nor	1
sociably	1
mild,	1
As	1
Raphael,	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
much	1
confide;	1
But	1
solemn	1
and	1
sublime;	1
whom	1
not	1
to	1
offend,	1
With	1
reverence	1
I	1
must	1
meet,	1
and	1
thou	1
retire.	1
He	1
ended:	1
and	1
the	1
Arch-Angel	1
soon	1
drew	1
nigh,	1
Not	1
in	1
his	1
shape	1
celestial,	1
but	1
as	1
man	1
Clad	1
to	1
meet	1
man;	1
over	1
his	1
lucid	1
arms	1
A	1
military	1
vest	1
of	1
purple	1
flowed,	1
Livelier	1
than	1
Meliboean,	1
or	1
the	1
grain	1
Of	1
Sarra,	1
worn	1
by	1
kings	1
and	1
heroes	1
old	1
In	1
time	1
of	1
truce;	1
Iris	1
had	1
dipt	1
the	1
woof;	1
His	1
starry	1
helm	1
unbuckled	1
showed	1
him	1
prime	1
In	1
manhood	1
where	1
youth	1
ended;	1
by	1
his	1
side,	1
As	1
in	1
a	1
glistering	1
zodiack,	1
hung	1
the	1
sword,	1
Satan's	1
dire	1
dread;	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
the	1
spear.	1
Adam	1
bowed	1
low;	1
he,	1
kingly,	1
from	1
his	1
state	1
Inclined	1
not,	1
but	1
his	1
coming	1
thus	1
declared.	1
Adam,	1
Heaven's	1
high	1
behest	1
no	1
preface	1
needs:	1
Sufficient	1
that	1
thy	1
prayers	1
are	1
heard;	1
and	1
Death,	1
Then	1
due	1
by	1
sentence	1
when	1
thou	1
didst	1
transgress,	1
Defeated	1
of	1
his	1
seisure	1
many	1
days	1
Given	1
thee	1
of	1
grace;	1
wherein	1
thou	1
mayest	1
repent,	1
And	1
one	1
bad	1
act	1
with	1
many	1
deeds	1
well	1
done	1
Mayest	1
cover:	1
Well	1
may	1
then	1
thy	1
Lord,	1
appeased,	1
Redeem	1
thee	1
quite	1
from	1
Death's	1
rapacious	1
claim;	1
But	1
longer	1
in	1
this	1
Paradise	1
to	1
dwell	1
Permits	1
not:	1
to	1
remove	1
thee	1
I	1
am	1
come,	1
And	1
send	1
thee	1
from	1
the	1
garden	1
forth	1
to	1
till	1
The	1
ground	1
whence	1
thou	1
wast	1
taken,	1
fitter	1
soil.	1
He	1
added	1
not;	1
for	1
Adam	1
at	1
the	1
news	1
Heart-struck	1
with	1
chilling	1
gripe	1
of	1
sorrow	1
stood,	1
That	1
all	1
his	1
senses	1
bound;	1
Eve,	1
who	1
unseen	1
Yet	1
all	1
had	1
heard,	1
with	1
audible	1
lament	1
Discovered	1
soon	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
her	1
retire.	1
O	1
unexpected	1
stroke,	1
worse	1
than	1
of	1
Death!	1
Must	1
I	1
thus	1
leave	1
thee$	1
Paradise?	1
thus	1
leave	1
Thee,	1
native	1
soil!	1
these	1
happy	1
walks	1
and	1
shades,	1
Fit	1
haunt	1
of	1
Gods?	1
where	1
I	1
had	1
hope	1
to	1
spend,	1
Quiet	1
though	1
sad,	1
the	1
respite	1
of	1
that	1
day	1
That	1
must	1
be	1
mortal	1
to	1
us	1
both.	1
O	1
flowers,	1
That	1
never	1
will	1
in	1
other	1
climate	1
grow,	1
My	1
early	1
visitation,	1
and	1
my	1
last	1
;t	1
even,	1
which	1
I	1
bred	1
up	1
with	1
tender	1
hand	1
From	1
the	1
first	1
opening	1
bud,	1
and	1
gave	1
ye	1
names!	1
Who	1
now	1
shall	1
rear	1
ye	1
to	1
the	1
sun,	1
or	1
rank	1
Your	1
tribes,	1
and	1
water	1
from	1
the	1
ambrosial	1
fount?	1
Thee	1
lastly,	1
nuptial	1
bower!	1
by	1
me	1
adorned	1
With	1
what	1
to	1
sight	1
or	1
smell	1
was	1
sweet!	1
from	1
thee	1
How	1
shall	1
I	1
part,	1
and	1
whither	1
wander	1
down	1
Into	1
a	1
lower	1
world;	1
to	1
this	1
obscure	1
And	1
wild?	1
how	1
shall	1
we	1
breathe	1
in	1
other	1
air	1
Less	1
pure,	1
accustomed	1
to	1
immortal	1
fruits?	1
Whom	1
thus	1
the	1
Angel	1
interrupted	1
mild.	1
Lament	1
not,	1
Eve,	1
but	1
patiently	1
resign	1
What	1
justly	1
thou	1
hast	1
lost,	1
nor	1
set	1
thy	1
heart,	1
Thus	1
over-fond,	1
on	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
not	1
thine:	1
Thy	1
going	1
is	1
not	1
lonely;	1
with	1
thee	1
goes	1
Thy	1
husband;	1
whom	1
to	1
follow	1
thou	1
art	1
bound;	1
Where	1
he	1
abides,	1
think	1
there	1
thy	1
native	1
soil.	1
Adam,	1
by	1
this	1
from	1
the	1
cold	1
sudden	1
damp	1
Recovering,	1
and	1
his	1
scattered	1
spirits	1
returned,	1
To	1
Michael	1
thus	1
his	1
humble	1
words	1
addressed.	1
Celestial,	1
whether	1
among	1
the	1
Thrones,	1
or	1
named	1
Of	1
them	1
the	1
highest;	1
for	1
such	1
of	1
shape	1
may	1
seem	1
Prince	1
above	1
princes!	1
gently	1
hast	1
thou	1
told	1
Thy	1
message,	1
which	1
might	1
else	1
in	1
telling	1
wound,	1
And	1
in	1
performing	1
end	1
us;	1
what	1
besides	1
Of	1
sorrow,	1
and	1
dejection,	1
and	1
despair,	1
Our	1
frailty	1
can	1
sustain,	1
thy	1
tidings	1
bring,	1
Departure	1
from	1
this	1
happy	1
place,	1
our	1
sweet	1
Recess,	1
and	1
only	1
consolation	1
left	1
Familiar	1
to	1
our	1
eyes!	1
all	1
places	1
else	1
Inhospitable	1
appear,	1
and	1
desolate;	1
Nor	1
knowing	1
us,	1
nor	1
known:	1
And,	1
if	1
by	1
prayer	1
Incessant	1
I	1
could	1
hope	1
to	1
change	1
the	1
will	1
Of	1
Him	1
who	1
all	1
things	1
can,	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
cease	1
To	1
weary	1
him	1
with	1
my	1
assiduous	1
cries:	1
But	1
prayer	1
against	1
his	1
absolute	1
decree	1
No	1
more	1
avails	1
than	1
breath	1
against	1
the	1
wind,	1
Blown	1
stifling	1
back	1
on	1
him	1
that	1
breathes	1
it	1
forth:	1
Therefore	1
to	1
his	1
great	1
bidding	1
I	1
submit.	1
This	1
most	1
afflicts	1
me,	1
that,	1
departing	1
hence,	1
As	1
from	1
his	1
face	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
hid,	1
deprived	1
His	1
blessed	1
countenance:	1
Here	1
I	1
could	1
frequent	1
With	1
worship	1
place	1
by	1
place	1
where	1
he	1
vouchsafed	1
Presence	1
Divine;	1
and	1
to	1
my	1
sons	1
relate,	1
'On	1
this	1
mount	1
he	1
appeared;	1
under	1
this	1
tree	1
'Stood	1
visible;	1
among	1
these	1
pines	1
his	1
voice	1
'I	1
heard;	1
here	1
with	1
him	1
at	1
this	1
fountain	1
talked:	1
So	1
many	1
grateful	1
altars	1
I	1
would	1
rear	1
Of	1
grassy	1
turf,	1
and	1
pile	1
up	1
every	1
stone	1
Of	1
lustre	1
from	1
the	1
brook,	1
in	1
memory,	1
Or	1
monument	1
to	1
ages;	1
and	1
theron	1
Offer	1
sweet-smelling	1
gums,	1
and	1
fruits,	1
and	1
flowers:	1
In	1
yonder	1
nether	1
world	1
where	1
shall	1
I	1
seek	1
His	1
bright	1
appearances,	1
or	1
foot-step	1
trace?	1
For	1
though	1
I	1
fled	1
him	1
angry,	1
yet	1
recalled	1
To	1
life	1
prolonged	1
and	1
promised	1
race,	1
I	1
now	1
Gladly	1
behold	1
though	1
but	1
his	1
utmost	1
skirts	1
Of	1
glory;	1
and	1
far	1
off	1
his	1
steps	1
adore.	1
To	1
whom	1
thus	1
Michael	1
with	1
regard	1
benign.	1
Adam,	1
thou	1
knowest	1
Heaven	1
his,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
Earth;	1
Not	1
this	1
rock	1
only;	1
his	1
Omnipresence	1
fills	1
Land,	1
sea,	1
and	1
air,	1
and	1
every	1
kind	1
that	1
lives,	1
Fomented	1
by	1
his	1
virtual	1
power	1
and	1
warmed:	1
All	1
the	1
earth	1
he	1
gave	1
thee	1
to	1
possess	1
and	1
rule,	1
No	1
despicable	1
gift;	1
surmise	1
not	1
then	1
His	1
presence	1
to	1
these	1
narrow	1
bounds	1
confined	1
Of	1
Paradise,	1
or	1
Eden:	1
this	1
had	1
been	1
Perhaps	1
thy	1
capital	1
seat,	1
from	1
whence	1
had	1
spread	1
All	1
generations;	1
and	1
had	1
hither	1
come	1
From	1
all	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
to	1
celebrate	1
And	1
reverence	1
thee,	1
their	1
great	1
progenitor.	1
But	1
this	1
pre-eminence	1
thou	1
hast	1
lost,	1
brought	1
down	1
To	1
dwell	1
on	1
even	1
ground	1
now	1
with	1
thy	1
sons:	1
Yet	1
doubt	1
not	1
but	1
in	1
valley,	1
and	1
in	1
plain,	1
God	1
is,	1
as	1
here;	1
and	1
will	1
be	1
found	1
alike	1
Present;	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
presence	1
many	1
a	1
sign	1
Still	1
following	1
thee,	1
still	1
compassing	1
thee	1
round	1
With	1
goodness	1
and	1
paternal	1
love,	1
his	1
face	1
Express,	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
steps	1
the	1
track	1
divine.	1
Which	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
believe,	1
and	1
be	1
confirmed	1
Ere	1
thou	1
from	1
hence	1
depart;	1
know,	1
I	1
am	1
sent	1
To	1
show	1
thee	1
what	1
shall	1
come	1
in	1
future	1
days	1
To	1
thee,	1
and	1
to	1
thy	1
offspring:	1
good	1
with	1
bad	1
Expect	1
to	1
hear;	1
supernal	1
grace	1
contending	1
With	1
sinfulness	1
of	1
men;	1
thereby	1
to	1
learn	1
True	1
patience,	1
and	1
to	1
temper	1
joy	1
with	1
fear	1
And	1
pious	1
sorrow;	1
equally	1
inured	1
By	1
moderation	1
either	1
state	1
to	1
bear,	1
Prosperous	1
or	1
adverse:	1
so	1
shalt	1
thou	1
lead	1
Safest	1
thy	1
life,	1
and	1
best	1
prepared	1
endure	1
Thy	1
mortal	1
passage	1
when	1
it	1
comes.--Ascend	1
This	1
hill;	1
let	1
Eve	1
(for	1
I	1
have	1
drenched	1
her	1
eyes)	1
Here	1
sleep	1
below;	1
while	1
thou	1
to	1
foresight	1
wakest;	1
As	1
once	1
thou	1
sleptst,	1
while	1
she	1
to	1
life	1
was	1
formed.	1
To	1
whom	1
thus	1
Adam	1
gratefully	1
replied.	1
Ascend,	1
I	1
follow	1
thee,	1
safe	1
Guide,	1
the	1
path	1
Thou	1
leadest	1
me;	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Heaven	1
submit,	1
However	1
chastening;	1
to	1
the	1
evil	1
turn	1
My	1
obvious	1
breast;	1
arming	1
to	1
overcome	1
By	1
suffering,	1
and	1
earn	1
rest	1
from	1
labour	1
won,	1
If	1
so	1
I	1
may	1
attain.	1
--	1
So	1
both	1
ascend	1
In	1
the	1
visions	1
of	1
God.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
hill,	1
Of	1
Paradise	1
the	1
highest;	1
from	1
whose	1
top	1
The	1
hemisphere	1
of	1
earth,	1
in	1
clearest	1
ken,	1
Stretched	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
amplest	1
reach	1
of	1
prospect	1
lay.	1
Not	1
higher	1
that	1
hill,	1
nor	1
wider	1
looking	1
round,	1
Whereon,	1
for	1
different	1
cause,	1
the	1
Tempter	1
set	1
Our	1
second	1
Adam,	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness;	1
To	1
show	1
him	1
all	1
Earth's	1
kingdoms,	1
and	1
their	1
glory.	1
His	1
eye	1
might	1
there	1
command	1
wherever	1
stood	1
City	1
of	1
old	1
or	1
modern	1
fame,	1
the	1
seat	1
Of	1
mightiest	1
empire,	1
from	1
the	1
destined	1
walls	1
Of	1
Cambalu,	1
seat	1
of	1
Cathaian	1
Can,	1
And	1
Samarchand	1
by	1
Oxus,	1
Temir's	1
throne,	1
To	1
Paquin	1
of	1
Sinaean	1
kings;	1
and	1
thence	1
To	1
Agra	1
and	1
Lahor	1
of	1
great	1
Mogul,	1
Down	1
to	1
the	1
golden	1
Chersonese;	1
or	1
where	1
The	1
Persian	1
in	1
Ecbatan	1
sat,	1
or	1
since	1
In	1
Hispahan;	1
or	1
where	1
the	1
Russian	1
Ksar	1
In	1
Mosco;	1
or	1
the	1
Sultan	1
in	1
Bizance,	1
Turchestan-born;	1
nor	1
could	1
his	1
eye	1
not	1
ken	1
The	1
empire	1
of	1
Negus	1
to	1
his	1
utmost	1
port	1
Ercoco,	1
and	1
the	1
less	1
maritim	1
kings	1
Mombaza,	1
and	1
Quiloa,	1
and	1
Melind,	1
And	1
Sofala,	1
thought	1
Ophir,	1
to	1
the	1
realm	1
Of	1
Congo,	1
and	1
Angola	1
farthest	1
south;	1
Or	1
thence	1
from	1
Niger	1
flood	1
to	1
Atlas	1
mount	1
The	1
kingdoms	1
of	1
Almansor,	1
Fez	1
and	1
Sus,	1
Morocco,	1
and	1
Algiers,	1
and	1
Tremisen;	1
On	1
Europe	1
thence,	1
and	1
where	1
Rome	1
was	1
to	1
sway	1
The	1
world:	1
in	1
spirit	1
perhaps	1
he	1
also	1
saw	1
Rich	1
Mexico,	1
the	1
seat	1
of	1
Montezume,	1
And	1
Cusco	1
in	1
Peru,	1
the	1
richer	1
seat	1
Of	1
Atabalipa;	1
and	1
yet	1
unspoiled	1
Guiana,	1
whose	1
great	1
city	1
Geryon's	1
sons	1
Call	1
El	1
Dorado.	1
But	1
to	1
nobler	1
sights	1
Michael	1
from	1
Adam's	1
eyes	1
the	1
film	1
removed,	1
Which	1
that	1
false	1
fruit	1
that	1
promised	1
clearer	1
sight	1
Had	1
bred;	1
then	1
purged	1
with	1
euphrasy	1
and	1
rue	1
The	1
visual	1
nerve,	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
much	1
to	1
see;	1
And	1
from	1
the	1
well	1
of	1
life	1
three	1
drops	1
instilled.	1
So	1
deep	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
these	1
ingredients	1
pierced,	1
Even	1
to	1
the	1
inmost	1
seat	1
of	1
mental	1
sight,	1
That	1
Adam,	1
now	1
enforced	1
to	1
close	1
his	1
eyes,	1
Sunk	1
down,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
spirits	1
became	1
entranced;	1
But	1
him	1
the	1
gentle	1
Angel	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
Soon	1
raised,	1
and	1
his	1
attention	1
thus	1
recalled.	1
Adam,	1
now	1
ope	1
thine	1
eyes;	1
and	1
first	1
behold	1
The	1
effects,	1
which	1
thy	1
original	1
crime	1
hath	1
wrought	1
In	1
some	1
to	1
spring	1
from	1
thee;	1
who	1
never	1
touched	1
The	1
excepted	1
tree;	1
nor	1
with	1
the	1
snake	1
conspired;	1
Nor	1
sinned	1
thy	1
sin;	1
yet	1
from	1
that	1
sin	1
derive	1
Corruption,	1
to	1
bring	1
forth	1
more	1
violent	1
deeds.	1
His	1
eyes	1
he	1
opened,	1
and	1
beheld	1
a	1
field,	1
Part	1
arable	1
and	1
tilth,	1
whereon	1
were	1
sheaves	1
New	1
reaped;	1
the	1
other	1
part	1
sheep-walks	1
and	1
folds;	1
I'	1
the	1
midst	1
an	1
altar	1
as	1
the	1
land-mark	1
stood,	1
Rustick,	1
of	1
grassy	1
sord;	1
thither	1
anon	1
A	1
sweaty	1
reaper	1
from	1
his	1
tillage	1
brought	1
First	1
fruits,	1
the	1
green	1
ear,	1
and	1
the	1
yellow	1
sheaf,	1
Unculled,	1
as	1
came	1
to	1
hand;	1
a	1
shepherd	1
next,	1
More	1
meek,	1
came	1
with	1
the	1
firstlings	1
of	1
his	1
flock,	1
Choicest	1
and	1
best;	1
then,	1
sacrificing,	1
laid	1
The	1
inwards	1
and	1
their	1
fat,	1
with	1
incense	1
strowed,	1
On	1
the	1
cleft	1
wood,	1
and	1
all	1
due	1
rights	1
performed:	1
His	1
offering	1
soon	1
propitious	1
fire	1
from	1
Heaven	1
Consumed	1
with	1
nimble	1
glance,	1
and	1
grateful	1
steam;	1
The	1
other's	1
not,	1
for	1
his	1
was	1
not	1
sincere;	1
Whereat	1
he	1
inly	1
raged,	1
and,	1
as	1
they	1
talked,	1
Smote	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
midriff	1
with	1
a	1
stone	1
That	1
beat	1
out	1
life;	1
he	1
fell;and,	1
deadly	1
pale,	1
Groaned	1
out	1
his	1
soul	1
with	1
gushing	1
blood	1
effused.	1
Much	1
at	1
that	1
sight	1
was	1
Adam	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
Dismayed,	1
and	1
thus	1
in	1
haste	1
to	1
the	1
Angel	1
cried.	1
O	1
Teacher,	1
some	1
great	1
mischief	1
hath	1
befallen	1
To	1
that	1
meek	1
man,	1
who	1
well	1
had	1
sacrificed;	1
Is	1
piety	1
thus	1
and	1
pure	1
devotion	1
paid?	1
To	1
whom	1
Michael	1
thus,	1
he	1
also	1
moved,	1
replied.	1
These	1
two	1
are	1
brethren,	1
Adam,	1
and	1
to	1
come	1
Out	1
of	1
thy	1
loins;	1
the	1
unjust	1
the	1
just	1
hath	1
slain,	1
For	1
envy	1
that	1
his	1
brother's	1
offering	1
found	1
From	1
Heaven	1
acceptance;	1
but	1
the	1
bloody	1
fact	1
Will	1
be	1
avenged;	1
and	1
the	1
other's	1
faith,	1
approved,	1
Lose	1
no	1
reward;	1
though	1
here	1
thou	1
see	1
him	1
die,	1
Rolling	1
in	1
dust	1
and	1
gore.	1
To	1
which	1
our	1
sire.	1
Alas!	1
both	1
for	1
the	1
deed,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
cause!	1
But	1
have	1
I	1
now	1
seen	1
Death?	1
Is	1
this	1
the	1
way	1
I	1
must	1
return	1
to	1
native	1
dust?	1
O	1
sight	1
Of	1
terrour,	1
foul	1
and	1
ugly	1
to	1
behold,	1
Horrid	1
to	1
think,	1
how	1
horrible	1
to	1
feel!	1
To	1
whom	1
thus	1
Michael.	1
Death	1
thou	1
hast	1
seen	1
In	1
his	1
first	1
shape	1
on	1
Man;	1
but	1
many	1
shapes	1
Of	1
Death,	1
and	1
many	1
are	1
the	1
ways	1
that	1
lead	1
To	1
his	1
grim	1
cave,	1
all	1
dismal;	1
yet	1
to	1
sense	1
More	1
terrible	1
at	1
the	1
entrance,	1
than	1
within.	1
Some,	1
as	1
thou	1
sawest,	1
by	1
violent	1
stroke	1
shall	1
die;	1
By	1
fire,	1
flood,	1
famine,	1
by	1
intemperance	1
more	1
In	1
meats	1
and	1
drinks,	1
which	1
on	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
bring	1
Diseases	1
dire,	1
of	1
which	1
a	1
monstrous	1
crew	1
Before	1
thee	1
shall	1
appear;	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
know	1
What	1
misery	1
the	1
inabstinence	1
of	1
Eve	1
Shall	1
bring	1
on	1
Men.	1
Immediately	1
a	1
place	1
Before	1
his	1
eyes	1
appeared,	1
sad,	1
noisome,	1
dark;	1
A	1
lazar-house	1
it	1
seemed;	1
wherein	1
were	1
laid	1
Numbers	1
of	1
all	1
diseased;	1
all	1
maladies	1
Of	1
ghastly	1
spasm,	1
or	1
racking	1
torture,	1
qualms	1
Of	1
heart-sick	1
agony,	1
all	1
feverous	1
kinds,	1
Convulsions,	1
epilepsies,	1
fierce	1
catarrhs,	1
Intestine	1
stone	1
and	1
ulcer,	1
colick-pangs,	1
Demoniack	1
phrenzy,	1
moaping	1
melancholy,	1
And	1
moon-struck	1
madness,	1
pining	1
atrophy,	1
Marasmus,	1
and	1
wide-wasting	1
pestilence,	1
Dropsies,	1
and	1
asthmas,	1
and	1
joint-racking	1
rheums.	1
Dire	1
was	1
the	1
tossing,	1
deep	1
the	1
groans;	1
Despair	1
Tended	1
the	1
sick	1
busiest	1
from	1
couch	1
to	1
couch;	1
And	1
over	1
them	1
triumphant	1
Death	1
his	1
dart	1
Shook,	1
but	1
delayed	1
to	1
strike,	1
though	1
oft	1
invoked	1
With	1
vows,	1
as	1
their	1
chief	1
good,	1
and	1
final	1
hope.	1
Sight	1
so	1
deform	1
what	1
heart	1
of	1
rock	1
could	1
long	1
Dry-eyed	1
behold?	1
Adam	1
could	1
not,	1
but	1
wept,	1
Though	1
not	1
of	1
woman	1
born;	1
compassion	1
quelled	1
His	1
best	1
of	1
man,	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
up	1
to	1
tears	1
A	1
space,	1
till	1
firmer	1
thoughts	1
restrained	1
excess;	1
And,	1
scarce	1
recovering	1
words,	1
his	1
plaint	1
renewed.	1
O	1
miserable	1
mankind,	1
to	1
what	1
fall	1
Degraded,	1
to	1
what	1
wretched	1
state	1
reserved!	1
Better	1
end	1
here	1
unborn.	1
Why	1
is	1
life	1
given	1
To	1
be	1
thus	1
wrested	1
from	1
us?	1
rather,	1
why	1
Obtruded	1
on	1
us	1
thus?	1
who,	1
if	1
we	1
knew	1
What	1
we	1
receive,	1
would	1
either	1
no	1
accept	1
Life	1
offered,	1
or	1
soon	1
beg	1
to	1
lay	1
it	1
down;	1
Glad	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
dismissed	1
in	1
peace.	1
Can	1
thus	1
The	1
image	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
Man,	1
created	1
once	1
So	1
goodly	1
and	1
erect,	1
though	1
faulty	1
since,	1
To	1
such	1
unsightly	1
sufferings	1
be	1
debased	1
Under	1
inhuman	1
pains?	1
Why	1
should	1
not	1
Man,	1
Retaining	1
still	1
divine	1
similitude	1
In	1
part,	1
from	1
such	1
deformities	1
be	1
free,	1
And,	1
for	1
his	1
Maker's	1
image	1
sake,	1
exempt?	1
Their	1
Maker's	1
image,	1
answered	1
Michael,	1
then	1
Forsook	1
them,	1
when	1
themselves	1
they	1
vilified	1
To	1
serve	1
ungoverned	1
Appetite;	1
and	1
took	1
His	1
image	1
whom	1
they	1
served,	1
a	1
brutish	1
vice,	1
Inductive	1
mainly	1
to	1
the	1
sin	1
of	1
Eve.	1
Therefore	1
so	1
abject	1
is	1
their	1
punishment,	1
Disfiguring	1
not	1
God's	1
likeness,	1
but	1
their	1
own;	1
Or	1
if	1
his	1
likeness,	1
by	1
themselves	1
defaced;	1
While	1
they	1
pervert	1
pure	1
Nature's	1
healthful	1
rules	1
To	1
loathsome	1
sickness;	1
worthily,	1
since	1
they	1
God's	1
image	1
did	1
not	1
reverence	1
in	1
themselves.	1
I	1
yield	1
it	1
just,	1
said	1
Adam,	1
and	1
submit.	1
But	1
is	1
there	1
yet	1
no	1
other	1
way,	1
besides	1
These	1
painful	1
passages,	1
how	1
we	1
may	1
come	1
To	1
death,	1
and	1
mix	1
with	1
our	1
connatural	1
dust?	1
There	1
is,	1
said	1
Michael,	1
if	1
thou	1
well	1
observe	1
The	1
rule	1
of	1
Not	1
too	1
much;	1
by	1
temperance	1
taught,	1
In	1
what	1
thou	1
eatest	1
and	1
drinkest;	1
seeking	1
from	1
thence	1
Due	1
nourishment,	1
not	1
gluttonous	1
delight,	1
Till	1
many	1
years	1
over	1
thy	1
head	1
return:	1
So	1
mayest	1
thou	1
live;	1
till,	1
like	1
ripe	1
fruit,	1
thou	1
drop	1
Into	1
thy	1
mother's	1
lap;	1
or	1
be	1
with	1
ease	1
Gathered,	1
nor	1
harshly	1
plucked;	1
for	1
death	1
mature:	1
This	1
is	1
Old	1
Age;	1
but	1
then,	1
thou	1
must	1
outlive	1
Thy	1
youth,	1
thy	1
strength,	1
thy	1
beauty;	1
which	1
will	1
change	1
To	1
withered,	1
weak,	1
and	1
gray;	1
thy	1
senses	1
then,	1
Obtuse,	1
all	1
taste	1
of	1
pleasure	1
must	1
forego,	1
To	1
what	1
thou	1
hast;	1
and,	1
for	1
the	1
air	1
of	1
youth,	1
Hopeful	1
and	1
cheerful,	1
in	1
thy	1
blood	1
will	1
reign	1
A	1
melancholy	1
damp	1
of	1
cold	1
and	1
dry	1
To	1
weigh	1
thy	1
spirits	1
down,	1
and	1
last	1
consume	1
The	1
balm	1
of	1
life.	1
To	1
whom	1
our	1
ancestor.	1
Henceforth	1
I	1
fly	1
not	1
death,	1
nor	1
would	1
prolong	1
Life	1
much;	1
bent	1
rather,	1
how	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
quit,	1
Fairest	1
and	1
easiest,	1
of	1
this	1
cumbrous	1
charge;	1
Which	1
I	1
must	1
keep	1
till	1
my	1
appointed	1
day	1
Of	1
rendering	1
up,	1
and	1
patiently	1
attend	1
My	1
dissolution.	1
Michael	1
replied.	1
Nor	1
love	1
thy	1
life,	1
nor	1
hate;	1
but	1
what	1
thou	1
livest	1
Live	1
well;	1
how	1
long,	1
or	1
short,	1
permit	1
to	1
Heaven:	1
And	1
now	1
prepare	1
thee	1
for	1
another	1
sight.	1
He	1
looked,	1
and	1
saw	1
a	1
spacious	1
plain,	1
whereon	1
Were	1
tents	1
of	1
various	1
hue;	1
by	1
some,	1
were	1
herds	1
Of	1
cattle	1
grazing;	1
others,	1
whence	1
the	1
sound	1
Of	1
instruments,	1
that	1
made	1
melodious	1
chime,	1
Was	1
heard,	1
of	1
harp	1
and	1
organ;	1
and,	1
who	1
moved	1
Their	1
stops	1
and	1
chords,	1
was	1
seen;	1
his	1
volant	1
touch,	1
Instinct	1
through	1
all	1
proportions,	1
low	1
and	1
high,	1
Fled	1
and	1
pursued	1
transverse	1
the	1
resonant	1
fugue.	1
In	1
other	1
part	1
stood	1
one	1
who,	1
at	1
the	1
forge	1
Labouring,	1
two	1
massy	1
clods	1
of	1
iron	1
and	1
brass	1
Had	1
melted,	1
(whether	1
found	1
where	1
casual	1
fire	1
Had	1
wasted	1
woods	1
on	1
mountain	1
or	1
in	1
vale,	1
Down	1
to	1
the	1
veins	1
of	1
earth;	1
thence	1
gliding	1
hot	1
To	1
some	1
cave's	1
mouth;	1
or	1
whether	1
washed	1
by	1
stream	1
From	1
underground;)	1
the	1
liquid	1
ore	1
he	1
drained	1
Into	1
fit	1
moulds	1
prepared;	1
from	1
which	1
he	1
formed	1
First	1
his	1
own	1
tools;	1
then,	1
what	1
might	1
else	1
be	1
wrought	1
Fusil	1
or	1
graven	1
in	1
metal.	1
After	1
these,	1
But	1
on	1
the	1
hither	1
side,	1
a	1
different	1
sort	1
From	1
the	1
high	1
neighbouring	1
hills,	1
which	1
was	1
their	1
seat,	1
Down	1
to	1
the	1
plain	1
descended;	1
by	1
their	1
guise	1
Just	1
men	1
they	1
seemed,	1
and	1
all	1
their	1
study	1
bent	1
To	1
worship	1
God	1
aright,	1
and	1
know	1
his	1
works	1
Not	1
hid;	1
nor	1
those	1
things	1
last,	1
which	1
might	1
preserve	1
Freedom	1
and	1
peace	1
to	1
Men;	1
they	1
on	1
the	1
plain	1
Long	1
had	1
not	1
walked,	1
when	1
from	1
the	1
tents,	1
behold!	1
A	1
bevy	1
of	1
fair	1
women,	1
richly	1
gay	1
In	1
gems	1
and	1
wanton	1
dress;	1
to	1
the	1
harp	1
they	1
sung	1
Soft	1
amorous	1
ditties,	1
and	1
in	1
dance	1
came	1
on:	1
The	1
men,	1
though	1
grave,	1
eyed	1
them;	1
and	1
let	1
their	1
eyes	1
Rove	1
without	1
rein;	1
till,	1
in	1
the	1
amorous	1
net	1
Fast	1
caught,	1
they	1
liked;	1
and	1
each	1
his	1
liking	1
chose;	1
And	1
now	1
of	1
love	1
they	1
treat,	1
till	1
the	1
evening-star,	1
Love's	1
harbinger,	1
appeared;	1
then,	1
all	1
in	1
heat	1
They	1
light	1
the	1
nuptial	1
torch,	1
and	1
bid	1
invoke	1
Hymen,	1
then	1
first	1
to	1
marriage	1
rites	1
invoked:	1
With	1
feast	1
and	1
musick	1
all	1
the	1
tents	1
resound.	1
Such	1
happy	1
interview,	1
and	1
fair	1
event	1
Of	1
love	1
and	1
youth	1
not	1
lost,	1
songs,	1
garlands,	1
flowers,	1
And	1
charming	1
symphonies,	1
attached	1
the	1
heart	1
Of	1
Adam,	1
soon	1
inclined	1
to	1
admit	1
delight,	1
The	1
bent	1
of	1
nature;	1
which	1
he	1
thus	1
expressed.	1
True	1
opener	1
of	1
mine	1
eyes,	1
prime	1
Angel	1
blest;	1
Much	1
better	1
seems	1
this	1
vision,	1
and	1
more	1
hope	1
Of	1
peaceful	1
days	1
portends,	1
than	1
those	1
two	1
past;	1
Those	1
were	1
of	1
hate	1
and	1
death,	1
or	1
pain	1
much	1
worse;	1
Here	1
Nature	1
seems	1
fulfilled	1
in	1
all	1
her	1
ends.	1
To	1
whom	1
thus	1
Michael.	1
Judge	1
not	1
what	1
is	1
best	1
By	1
pleasure,	1
though	1
to	1
nature	1
seeming	1
meet;	1
Created,	1
as	1
thou	1
art,	1
to	1
nobler	1
end	1
Holy	1
and	1
pure,	1
conformity	1
divine.	1
Those	1
tents	1
thou	1
sawest	1
so	1
pleasant,	1
were	1
the	1
tents	1
Of	1
wickedness,	1
wherein	1
shall	1
dwell	1
his	1
race	1
Who	1
slew	1
his	1
brother;	1
studious	1
they	1
appear	1
Of	1
arts	1
that	1
polish	1
life,	1
inventers	1
rare;	1
Unmindful	1
of	1
their	1
Maker,	1
though	1
his	1
Spirit	1
Taught	1
them;	1
but	1
they	1
his	1
gifts	1
acknowledged	1
none.	1
Yet	1
they	1
a	1
beauteous	1
offspring	1
shall	1
beget;	1
For	1
that	1
fair	1
female	1
troop	1
thou	1
sawest,	1
that	1
seemed	1
Of	1
Goddesses,	1
so	1
blithe,	1
so	1
smooth,	1
so	1
gay,	1
Yet	1
empty	1
of	1
all	1
good	1
wherein	1
consists	1
Woman's	1
domestick	1
honour	1
and	1
chief	1
praise;	1
Bred	1
only	1
and	1
completed	1
to	1
the	1
taste	1
Of	1
lustful	1
appetence,	1
to	1
sing,	1
to	1
dance,	1
To	1
dress,	1
and	1
troll	1
the	1
tongue,	1
and	1
roll	1
the	1
eye:	1
To	1
these	1
that	1
sober	1
race	1
of	1
men,	1
whose	1
lives	1
Religious	1
titled	1
them	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
God,	1
Shall	1
yield	1
up	1
all	1
their	1
virtue,	1
all	1
their	1
fame	1
Ignobly,	1
to	1
the	1
trains	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
smiles	1
Of	1
these	1
fair	1
atheists;	1
and	1
now	1
swim	1
in	1
joy,	1
Erelong	1
to	1
swim	1
at	1
large;	1
and	1
laugh,	1
for	1
which	1
The	1
world	1
erelong	1
a	1
world	1
of	1
tears	1
must	1
weep.	1
To	1
whom	1
thus	1
Adam,	1
of	1
short	1
joy	1
bereft.	1
O	1
pity	1
and	1
shame,	1
that	1
they,	1
who	1
to	1
live	1
well	1
Entered	1
so	1
fair,	1
should	1
turn	1
aside	1
to	1
tread	1
Paths	1
indirect,	1
or	1
in	1
the	1
mid	1
way	1
faint!	1
But	1
still	1
I	1
see	1
the	1
tenour	1
of	1
Man's	1
woe	1
Holds	1
on	1
the	1
same,	1
from	1
Woman	1
to	1
begin.	1
From	1
Man's	1
effeminate	1
slackness	1
it	1
begins,	1
Said	1
the	1
Angel,	1
who	1
should	1
better	1
hold	1
his	1
place	1
By	1
wisdom,	1
and	1
superiour	1
gifts	1
received.	1
But	1
now	1
prepare	1
thee	1
for	1
another	1
scene.	1
He	1
looked,	1
and	1
saw	1
wide	1
territory	1
spread	1
Before	1
him,	1
towns,	1
and	1
rural	1
works	1
between;	1
Cities	1
of	1
men	1
with	1
lofty	1
gates	1
and	1
towers,	1
Concourse	1
in	1
arms,	1
fierce	1
faces	1
threatening	1
war,	1
Giants	1
of	1
mighty	1
bone	1
and	1
bold	1
emprise;	1
Part	1
wield	1
their	1
arms,	1
part	1
curb	1
the	1
foaming	1
steed,	1
Single	1
or	1
in	1
array	1
of	1
battle	1
ranged	1
Both	1
horse	1
and	1
foot,	1
nor	1
idly	1
mustering	1
stood;	1
One	1
way	1
a	1
band	1
select	1
from	1
forage	1
drives	1
A	1
herd	1
of	1
beeves,	1
fair	1
oxen	1
and	1
fair	1
kine,	1
From	1
a	1
fat	1
meadow	1
ground;	1
or	1
fleecy	1
flock,	1
Ewes	1
and	1
their	1
bleating	1
lambs	1
over	1
the	1
plain,	1
Their	1
booty;	1
scarce	1
with	1
life	1
the	1
shepherds	1
fly,	1
But	1
call	1
in	1
aid,	1
which	1
makes	1
a	1
bloody	1
fray;	1
With	1
cruel	1
tournament	1
the	1
squadrons	1
join;	1
Where	1
cattle	1
pastured	1
late,	1
now	1
scattered	1
lies	1
With	1
carcasses	1
and	1
arms	1
the	1
ensanguined	1
field,	1
Deserted:	1
Others	1
to	1
a	1
city	1
strong	1
Lay	1
siege,	1
encamped;	1
by	1
battery,	1
scale,	1
and	1
mine,	1
Assaulting;	1
others	1
from	1
the	1
wall	1
defend	1
With	1
dart	1
and	1
javelin,	1
stones,	1
and	1
sulphurous	1
fire;	1
On	1
each	1
hand	1
slaughter,	1
and	1
gigantick	1
deeds.	1
In	1
other	1
part	1
the	1
sceptered	1
heralds	1
call	1
To	1
council,	1
in	1
the	1
city-gates;	1
anon	1
Gray-headed	1
men	1
and	1
grave,	1
with	1
warriours	1
mixed,	1
Assemble,	1
and	1
harangues	1
are	1
heard;	1
but	1
soon,	1
In	1
factious	1
opposition;	1
till	1
at	1
last,	1
Of	1
middle	1
age	1
one	1
rising,	1
eminent	1
In	1
wise	1
deport,	1
spake	1
much	1
of	1
right	1
and	1
wrong,	1
Of	1
justice,	1
or	1
religion,	1
truth,	1
and	1
peace,	1
And	1
judgement	1
from	1
above:	1
him	1
old	1
and	1
young	1
Exploded,	1
and	1
had	1
seized	1
with	1
violent	1
hands,	1
Had	1
not	1
a	1
cloud	1
descending	1
snatched	1
him	1
thence	1
Unseen	1
amid	1
the	1
throng:	1
so	1
violence	1
Proceeded,	1
and	1
oppression,	1
and	1
sword-law,	1
Through	1
all	1
the	1
plain,	1
and	1
refuge	1
none	1
was	1
found.	1
Adam	1
was	1
all	1
in	1
tears,	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
guide	1
Lamenting	1
turned	1
full	1
sad;	1
O!what	1
are	1
these,	1
Death's	1
ministers,	1
not	1
men?	1
who	1
thus	1
deal	1
death	1
Inhumanly	1
to	1
men,	1
and	1
multiply	1
Ten	1
thousandfold	1
the	1
sin	1
of	1
him	1
who	1
slew	1
His	1
brother:	1
for	1
of	1
whom	1
such	1
massacre	1
Make	1
they,	1
but	1
of	1
their	1
brethren;	1
men	1
of	1
men	1
But	1
who	1
was	1
that	1
just	1
man,	1
whom	1
had	1
not	1
Heaven	1
Rescued,	1
had	1
in	1
his	1
righteousness	1
been	1
lost?	1
To	1
whom	1
thus	1
Michael.	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
product	1
Of	1
those	1
ill-mated	1
marriages	1
thou	1
sawest;	1
Where	1
good	1
with	1
bad	1
were	1
matched,	1
who	1
of	1
themselves	1
Abhor	1
to	1
join;	1
and,	1
by	1
imprudence	1
mixed,	1
Produce	1
prodigious	1
births	1
of	1
body	1
or	1
mind.	1
Such	1
were	1
these	1
giants,	1
men	1
of	1
high	1
renown;	1
For	1
in	1
those	1
days	1
might	1
only	1
shall	1
be	1
admired,	1
And	1
valour	1
and	1
heroick	1
virtue	1
called;	1
To	1
overcome	1
in	1
battle,	1
and	1
subdue	1
Nations,	1
and	1
bring	1
home	1
spoils	1
with	1
infinite	1
Man-slaughter,	1
shall	1
be	1
held	1
the	1
highest	1
pitch	1
Of	1
human	1
glory;	1
and	1
for	1
glory	1
done	1
Of	1
triumph,	1
to	1
be	1
styled	1
great	1
conquerours	1
Patrons	1
of	1
mankind,	1
Gods,	1
and	1
sons	1
of	1
Gods;	1
Destroyers	1
rightlier	1
called,	1
and	1
plagues	1
of	1
men.	1
Thus	1
fame	1
shall	1
be	1
achieved,	1
renown	1
on	1
earth;	1
And	1
what	1
most	1
merits	1
fame,	1
in	1
silence	1
hid.	1
But	1
he,	1
the	1
seventh	1
from	1
thee,	1
whom	1
thou	1
beheldst	1
The	1
only	1
righteous	1
in	1
a	1
world	1
preverse,	1
And	1
therefore	1
hated,	1
therefore	1
so	1
beset	1
With	1
foes,	1
for	1
daring	1
single	1
to	1
be	1
just,	1
And	1
utter	1
odious	1
truth,	1
that	1
God	1
would	1
come	1
To	1
judge	1
them	1
with	1
his	1
Saints;	1
him	1
the	1
Most	1
High	1
Rapt	1
in	1
a	1
balmy	1
cloud	1
with	1
winged	1
steeds	1
Did,	1
as	1
thou	1
sawest,	1
receive,	1
to	1
walk	1
with	1
God	1
High	1
in	1
salvation	1
and	1
the	1
climes	1
of	1
bliss,	1
Exempt	1
from	1
death;	1
to	1
show	1
thee	1
what	1
reward	1
Awaits	1
the	1
good;	1
the	1
rest	1
what	1
punishment;	1
Which	1
now	1
direct	1
thine	1
eyes	1
and	1
soon	1
behold.	1
He	1
looked,	1
and	1
saw	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
things	1
quite	1
changed;	1
The	1
brazen	1
throat	1
of	1
war	1
had	1
ceased	1
to	1
roar;	1
All	1
now	1
was	1
turned	1
to	1
jollity	1
and	1
game,	1
To	1
luxury	1
and	1
riot,	1
feast	1
and	1
dance;	1
Marrying	1
or	1
prostituting,	1
as	1
befel,	1
Rape	1
or	1
adultery,	1
where	1
passing	1
fair	1
Allured	1
them;	1
thence	1
from	1
cups	1
to	1
civil	1
broils.	1
At	1
length	1
a	1
reverend	1
sire	1
among	1
them	1
came,	1
And	1
of	1
their	1
doings	1
great	1
dislike	1
declared,	1
And	1
testified	1
against	1
their	1
ways;	1
he	1
oft	1
Frequented	1
their	1
assemblies,	1
whereso	1
met,	1
Triumphs	1
or	1
festivals;	1
and	1
to	1
them	1
preached	1
Conversion	1
and	1
repentance,	1
as	1
to	1
souls	1
In	1
prison,	1
under	1
judgements	1
imminent:	1
But	1
all	1
in	1
vain:	1
which	1
when	1
he	1
saw,	1
he	1
ceased	1
Contending,	1
and	1
removed	1
his	1
tents	1
far	1
off;	1
Then,	1
from	1
the	1
mountain	1
hewing	1
timber	1
tall,	1
Began	1
to	1
build	1
a	1
vessel	1
of	1
huge	1
bulk;	1
Measured	1
by	1
cubit,	1
length,	1
and	1
breadth,	1
and	1
highth;	1
Smeared	1
round	1
with	1
pitch;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
side	1
a	1
door	1
Contrived;	1
and	1
of	1
provisions	1
laid	1
in	1
large,	1
For	1
man	1
and	1
beast:	1
when	1
lo,	1
a	1
wonder	1
strange!	1
Of	1
every	1
beast,	1
and	1
bird,	1
and	1
insect	1
small,	1
Came	1
sevens,	1
and	1
pairs;	1
and	1
entered	1
in	1
as	1
taught	1
Their	1
order:	1
last	1
the	1
sire	1
and	1
his	1
three	1
sons,	1
With	1
their	1
four	1
wives;	1
and	1
God	1
made	1
fast	1
the	1
door.	1
Mean	1
while	1
the	1
south-wind	1
rose,	1
and,	1
with	1
black	1
wings	1
Wide-hovering,	1
all	1
the	1
clouds	1
together	1
drove	1
From	1
under	1
Heaven;	1
the	1
hills	1
to	1
their	1
supply	1
Vapour,	1
and	1
exhalation	1
dusk	1
and	1
moist,	1
Sent	1
up	1
amain;	1
and	1
now	1
the	1
thickened	1
sky	1
Like	1
a	1
dark	1
cieling	1
stood;	1
down	1
rushed	1
the	1
rain	1
Impetuous;	1
and	1
continued,	1
till	1
the	1
earth	1
No	1
more	1
was	1
seen:	1
the	1
floating	1
vessel	1
swum	1
Uplifted,	1
and	1
secure	1
with	1
beaked	1
prow	1
Rode	1
tilting	1
o'er	1
the	1
waves;	1
all	1
dwellings	1
else	1
Flood	1
overwhelmed,	1
and	1
them	1
with	1
all	1
their	1
pomp	1
Deep	1
under	1
water	1
rolled;	1
sea	1
covered	1
sea,	1
Sea	1
without	1
shore;	1
and	1
in	1
their	1
palaces,	1
Where	1
luxury	1
late	1
reigned,	1
sea-monsters	1
whelped	1
And	1
stabled;	1
of	1
mankind,	1
so	1
numerous	1
late,	1
All	1
left,	1
in	1
one	1
small	1
bottom	1
swum	1
imbarked.	1
How	1
didst	1
thou	1
grieve	1
then,	1
Adam,	1
to	1
behold	1
The	1
end	1
of	1
all	1
thy	1
offspring,	1
end	1
so	1
sad,	1
Depopulation!	1
Thee	1
another	1
flood,	1
Of	1
tears	1
and	1
sorrow	1
a	1
flood,	1
thee	1
also	1
drowned,	1
And	1
sunk	1
thee	1
as	1
thy	1
sons;	1
till,	1
gently	1
reared	1
By	1
the	1
Angel,	1
on	1
thy	1
feet	1
thou	1
stoodest	1
at	1
last,	1
Though	1
comfortless;	1
as	1
when	1
a	1
father	1
mourns	1
His	1
children,	1
all	1
in	1
view	1
destroyed	1
at	1
once;	1
And	1
scarce	1
to	1
the	1
Angel	1
utter'dst	1
thus	1
thy	1
plaint.	1
O	1
visions	1
ill	1
foreseen!	1
Better	1
had	1
I	1
Lived	1
ignorant	1
of	1
future!	1
so	1
had	1
borne	1
My	1
part	1
of	1
evil	1
only,	1
each	1
day's	1
lot	1
Enough	1
to	1
bear;	1
those	1
now,	1
that	1
were	1
dispensed	1
The	1
burden	1
of	1
many	1
ages,	1
on	1
me	1
light	1
At	1
once,	1
by	1
my	1
foreknowledge	1
gaining	1
birth	1
Abortive,	1
to	1
torment	1
me	1
ere	1
their	1
being,	1
With	1
thought	1
that	1
they	1
must	1
be.	1
Let	1
no	1
man	1
seek	1
Henceforth	1
to	1
be	1
foretold,	1
what	1
shall	1
befall	1
Him	1
or	1
his	1
children;	1
evil	1
he	1
may	1
be	1
sure,	1
Which	1
neither	1
his	1
foreknowing	1
can	1
prevent;	1
And	1
he	1
the	1
future	1
evil	1
shall	1
no	1
less	1
In	1
apprehension	1
than	1
in	1
substance	1
feel,	1
Grievous	1
to	1
bear:	1
but	1
that	1
care	1
now	1
is	1
past,	1
Man	1
is	1
not	1
whom	1
to	1
warn:	1
those	1
few	1
escaped	1
Famine	1
and	1
anguish	1
will	1
at	1
last	1
consume,	1
Wandering	1
that	1
watery	1
desart:	1
I	1
had	1
hope,	1
When	1
violence	1
was	1
ceased,	1
and	1
war	1
on	1
earth,	1
All	1
would	1
have	1
then	1
gone	1
well;	1
peace	1
would	1
have	1
crowned	1
With	1
length	1
of	1
happy	1
days	1
the	1
race	1
of	1
Man;	1
But	1
I	1
was	1
far	1
deceived;	1
for	1
now	1
I	1
see	1
Peace	1
to	1
corrupt	1
no	1
less	1
than	1
war	1
to	1
waste.	1
How	1
comes	1
it	1
thus?	1
unfold,	1
celestial	1
Guide,	1
And	1
whether	1
here	1
the	1
race	1
of	1
Man	1
will	1
end.	1
To	1
whom	1
thus	1
Michael.	1
Those,	1
whom	1
last	1
thou	1
sawest	1
In	1
triumph	1
and	1
luxurious	1
wealth,	1
are	1
they	1
First	1
seen	1
in	1
acts	1
of	1
prowess	1
eminent	1
And	1
great	1
exploits,	1
but	1
of	1
true	1
virtue	1
void;	1
Who,	1
having	1
spilt	1
much	1
blood,	1
and	1
done	1
much	1
wast	1
Subduing	1
nations,	1
and	1
achieved	1
thereby	1
Fame	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
high	1
titles,	1
and	1
rich	1
prey;	1
Shall	1
change	1
their	1
course	1
to	1
pleasure,	1
ease,	1
and	1
sloth,	1
Surfeit,	1
and	1
lust;	1
till	1
wantonness	1
and	1
pride	1
Raise	1
out	1
of	1
friendship	1
hostile	1
deeds	1
in	1
peace.	1
The	1
conquered	1
also,	1
and	1
enslaved	1
by	1
war,	1
Shall,	1
with	1
their	1
freedom	1
lost,	1
all	1
virtue	1
lose	1
And	1
fear	1
of	1
God;	1
from	1
whom	1
their	1
piety	1
feigned	1
In	1
sharp	1
contest	1
of	1
battle	1
found	1
no	1
aid	1
Against	1
invaders;	1
therefore,	1
cooled	1
in	1
zeal,	1
Thenceforth	1
shall	1
practice	1
how	1
to	1
live	1
secure,	1
Worldly	1
or	1
dissolute,	1
on	1
what	1
their	1
lords	1
Shall	1
leave	1
them	1
to	1
enjoy;	1
for	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
bear	1
More	1
than	1
enough,	1
that	1
temperance	1
may	1
be	1
tried:	1
So	1
all	1
shall	1
turn	1
degenerate,	1
all	1
depraved;	1
Justice	1
and	1
temperance,	1
truth	1
and	1
faith,	1
forgot;	1
One	1
man	1
except,	1
the	1
only	1
son	1
of	1
light	1
In	1
a	1
dark	1
age,	1
against	1
example	1
good,	1
Against	1
allurement,	1
custom,	1
and	1
a	1
world	1
Offended:	1
fearless	1
of	1
reproach	1
and	1
scorn,	1
The	1
grand-child,	1
with	1
twelve	1
sons	1
encreased,	1
departs	1
From	1
Canaan,	1
to	1
a	1
land	1
hereafter	1
called	1
Egypt,	1
divided	1
by	1
the	1
river	1
Nile;	1
See	1
where	1
it	1
flows,	1
disgorging	1
at	1
seven	1
mouths	1
Into	1
the	1
sea:	1
To	1
sojourn	1
in	1
that	1
land	1
He	1
comes,	1
invited	1
by	1
a	1
younger	1
son	1
In	1
time	1
of	1
dearth;	1
a	1
son,	1
whose	1
worthy	1
deeds	1
Raise	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
second	1
in	1
that	1
realm	1
Of	1
Pharaoh:	1
There	1
he	1
dies,	1
and	1
leaves	1
his	1
race	1
Growing	1
into	1
a	1
nation,	1
and	1
now	1
grown	1
Suspected	1
to	1
a	1
sequent	1
king,	1
who	1
seeks	1
To	1
stop	1
their	1
overgrowth,	1
as	1
inmate	1
guests	1
Or	1
violence,	1
he	1
of	1
their	1
wicked	1
ways	1
Shall	1
them	1
admonish;	1
and	1
before	1
them	1
set	1
The	1
paths	1
of	1
righteousness,	1
how	1
much	1
more	1
safe	1
And	1
full	1
of	1
peace;	1
denouncing	1
wrath	1
to	1
come	1
On	1
their	1
impenitence;	1
and	1
shall	1
return	1
Of	1
them	1
derided,	1
but	1
of	1
God	1
observed	1
The	1
one	1
just	1
man	1
alive;	1
by	1
his	1
command	1
Shall	1
build	1
a	1
wonderous	1
ark,	1
as	1
thou	1
beheldst,	1
To	1
save	1
himself,	1
and	1
houshold,	1
from	1
amidst	1
A	1
world	1
devote	1
to	1
universal	1
wrack.	1
No	1
sooner	1
he,	1
with	1
them	1
of	1
man	1
and	1
beast	1
Select	1
for	1
life,	1
shall	1
in	1
the	1
ark	1
be	1
lodged,	1
And	1
sheltered	1
round;	1
but	1
all	1
the	1
cataracts	1
Of	1
Heaven	1
set	1
open	1
on	1
the	1
Earth	1
shall	1
pour	1
Rain,	1
day	1
and	1
night;	1
all	1
fountains	1
of	1
the	1
deep,	1
Broke	1
up,	1
shall	1
heave	1
the	1
ocean	1
to	1
usurp	1
Beyond	1
all	1
bounds;	1
till	1
inundation	1
rise	1
Above	1
the	1
highest	1
hills:	1
Then	1
shall	1
this	1
mount	1
Of	1
Paradise	1
by	1
might	1
of	1
waves	1
be	1
moved	1
Out	1
of	1
his	1
place,	1
pushed	1
by	1
the	1
horned	1
flood,	1
With	1
all	1
his	1
verdure	1
spoiled,	1
and	1
trees	1
adrift,	1
Down	1
the	1
great	1
river	1
to	1
the	1
opening	1
gulf,	1
And	1
there	1
take	1
root	1
an	1
island	1
salt	1
and	1
bare,	1
The	1
haunt	1
of	1
seals,	1
and	1
orcs,	1
and	1
sea-mews'	1
clang:	1
To	1
teach	1
thee	1
that	1
God	1
attributes	1
to	1
place	1
No	1
sanctity,	1
if	1
none	1
be	1
thither	1
brought	1
By	1
men	1
who	1
there	1
frequent,	1
or	1
therein	1
dwell.	1
And	1
now,	1
what	1
further	1
shall	1
ensue,	1
behold.	1
He	1
looked,	1
and	1
saw	1
the	1
ark	1
hull	1
on	1
the	1
flood,	1
Which	1
now	1
abated;	1
for	1
the	1
clouds	1
were	1
fled,	1
Driven	1
by	1
a	1
keen	1
north-wind,	1
that,	1
blowing	1
dry,	1
Wrinkled	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
deluge,	1
as	1
decayed;	1
And	1
the	1
clear	1
sun	1
on	1
his	1
wide	1
watery	1
glass	1
Gazed	1
hot,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
fresh	1
wave	1
largely	1
drew,	1
As	1
after	1
thirst;	1
which	1
made	1
their	1
flowing	1
shrink	1
From	1
standing	1
lake	1
to	1
tripping	1
ebb,	1
that	1
stole	1
With	1
soft	1
foot	1
towards	1
the	1
deep;	1
who	1
now	1
had	1
stopt	1
His	1
sluces,	1
as	1
the	1
Heaven	1
his	1
windows	1
shut.	1
The	1
ark	1
no	1
more	1
now	1
floats,	1
but	1
seems	1
on	1
ground,	1
Fast	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
some	1
high	1
mountain	1
fixed.	1
And	1
now	1
the	1
tops	1
of	1
hills,	1
as	1
rocks,	1
appear;	1
With	1
clamour	1
thence	1
the	1
rapid	1
currents	1
drive,	1
Towards	1
the	1
retreating	1
sea,	1
their	1
furious	1
tide.	1
Forthwith	1
from	1
out	1
the	1
ark	1
a	1
raven	1
flies,	1
And	1
after	1
him,	1
the	1
surer	1
messenger,	1
A	1
dove	1
sent	1
forth	1
once	1
and	1
again	1
to	1
spy	1
Green	1
tree	1
or	1
ground,	1
whereon	1
his	1
foot	1
may	1
light:	1
The	1
second	1
time	1
returning,	1
in	1
his	1
bill	1
An	1
olive-leaf	1
he	1
brings,	1
pacifick	1
sign:	1
Anon	1
dry	1
ground	1
appears,	1
and	1
from	1
his	1
ark	1
The	1
ancient	1
sire	1
descends,	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
train;	1
Then	1
with	1
uplifted	1
hands,	1
and	1
eyes	1
devout,	1
Grateful	1
to	1
Heaven,	1
over	1
his	1
head	1
beholds	1
A	1
dewy	1
cloud,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
cloud	1
a	1
bow	1
Conspicuous	1
with	1
three	1
lifted	1
colours	1
gay,	1
Betokening	1
peace	1
from	1
God,	1
and	1
covenant	1
new.	1
Whereat	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
Adam,	1
erst	1
so	1
sad,	1
Greatly	1
rejoiced;	1
and	1
thus	1
his	1
joy	1
broke	1
forth.	1
O	1
thou,	1
who	1
future	1
things	1
canst	1
represent	1
As	1
present,	1
heavenly	1
Instructer!	1
I	1
revive	1
At	1
this	1
last	1
sight;	1
assured	1
that	1
Man	1
shall	1
live,	1
With	1
all	1
the	1
creatures,	1
and	1
their	1
seed	1
preserve.	1
Far	1
less	1
I	1
now	1
lament	1
for	1
one	1
whole	1
world	1
Of	1
wicked	1
sons	1
destroyed,	1
than	1
I	1
rejoice	1
For	1
one	1
man	1
found	1
so	1
perfect,	1
and	1
so	1
just,	1
That	1
God	1
vouchsafes	1
to	1
raise	1
another	1
world	1
From	1
him,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
anger	1
to	1
forget.	1
But	1
say,	1
what	1
mean	1
those	1
coloured	1
streaks	1
in	1
Heaven	1
Distended,	1
as	1
the	1
brow	1
of	1
God	1
appeased?	1
Or	1
serve	1
they,	1
as	1
a	1
flowery	1
verge,	1
to	1
bind	1
The	1
fluid	1
skirts	1
of	1
that	1
same	1
watery	1
cloud,	1
Lest	1
it	1
again	1
dissolve,	1
and	1
shower	1
the	1
earth?	1
To	1
whom	1
the	1
Arch-Angel.	1
Dextrously	1
thou	1
aimest;	1
So	1
willingly	1
doth	1
God	1
remit	1
his	1
ire,	1
Though	1
late	1
repenting	1
him	1
of	1
Man	1
depraved;	1
Grieved	1
at	1
his	1
heart,	1
when	1
looking	1
down	1
he	1
saw	1
The	1
whole	1
earth	1
filled	1
with	1
violence,	1
and	1
all	1
flesh	1
Corrupting	1
each	1
their	1
way;	1
yet,	1
those	1
removed,	1
Such	1
grace	1
shall	1
one	1
just	1
man	1
find	1
in	1
his	1
sight,	1
That	1
he	1
relents,	1
not	1
to	1
blot	1
out	1
mankind;	1
And	1
makes	1
a	1
covenant	1
never	1
to	1
destroy	1
The	1
earth	1
again	1
by	1
flood;	1
nor	1
let	1
the	1
sea	1
Surpass	1
his	1
bounds;	1
nor	1
rain	1
to	1
drown	1
the	1
world,	1
With	1
man	1
therein	1
or	1
beast;	1
but,	1
when	1
he	1
brings	1
Over	1
the	1
earth	1
a	1
cloud,	1
will	1
therein	1
set	1
His	1
triple-coloured	1
bow,	1
whereon	1
to	1
look,	1
And	1
call	1
to	1
mind	1
his	1
covenant:	1
Day	1
and	1
night,	1
Seed-time	1
and	1
harvest,	1
heat	1
and	1
hoary	1
frost,	1
Shall	1
hold	1
their	1
course;	1
till	1
fire	1
purge	1
all	1
things	1
new,	1
Both	1
Heaven	1
and	1
Earth,	1
wherein	1
the	1
just	1
shall	1
dwell.	1
Book	1
XII	1
As	1
one	1
who	1
in	1
his	1
journey	1
bates	1
at	1
noon,	1
Though	1
bent	1
on	1
speed;	1
so	1
here	1
the	1
Arch-Angel	1
paused	1
Betwixt	1
the	1
world	1
destroyed	1
and	1
world	1
restored,	1
If	1
Adam	1
aught	1
perhaps	1
might	1
interpose;	1
Then,	1
with	1
transition	1
sweet,	1
new	1
speech	1
resumes.	1
Thus	1
thou	1
hast	1
seen	1
one	1
world	1
begin,	1
and	1
end;	1
And	1
Man,	1
as	1
from	1
a	1
second	1
stock,	1
proceed.	1
Much	1
thou	1
hast	1
yet	1
to	1
see;	1
but	1
I	1
perceive	1
Thy	1
mortal	1
sight	1
to	1
fail;	1
objects	1
divine	1
Must	1
needs	1
impair	1
and	1
weary	1
human	1
sense:	1
Henceforth	1
what	1
is	1
to	1
come	1
I	1
will	1
relate;	1
Thou	1
therefore	1
give	1
due	1
audience,	1
and	1
attend.	1
This	1
second	1
source	1
of	1
Men,	1
while	1
yet	1
but	1
few,	1
And	1
while	1
the	1
dread	1
of	1
judgement	1
past	1
remains	1
Fresh	1
in	1
their	1
minds,	1
fearing	1
the	1
Deity,	1
With	1
some	1
regard	1
to	1
what	1
is	1
just	1
and	1
right	1
Shall	1
lead	1
their	1
lives,	1
and	1
multiply	1
apace;	1
Labouring	1
the	1
soil,	1
and	1
reaping	1
plenteous	1
crop,	1
Corn,	1
wine,	1
and	1
oil;	1
and,	1
from	1
the	1
herd	1
or	1
flock,	1
Oft	1
sacrificing	1
bullock,	1
lamb,	1
or	1
kid,	1
With	1
large	1
wine-offerings	1
poured,	1
and	1
sacred	1
feast,	1
Shall	1
spend	1
their	1
days	1
in	1
joy	1
unblamed;	1
and	1
dwell	1
Long	1
time	1
in	1
peace,	1
by	1
families	1
and	1
tribes,	1
Under	1
paternal	1
rule:	1
till	1
one	1
shall	1
rise	1
Of	1
proud	1
ambitious	1
heart;	1
who,	1
not	1
content	1
With	1
fair	1
equality,	1
fraternal	1
state,	1
Will	1
arrogate	1
dominion	1
undeserved	1
Over	1
his	1
brethren,	1
and	1
quite	1
dispossess	1
Concord	1
and	1
law	1
of	1
nature	1
from	1
the	1
earth;	1
Hunting	1
(and	1
men	1
not	1
beasts	1
shall	1
be	1
his	1
game)	1
With	1
war,	1
and	1
hostile	1
snare,	1
such	1
as	1
refuse	1
Subjection	1
to	1
his	1
empire	1
tyrannous:	1
A	1
mighty	1
hunter	1
thence	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
styled	1
Before	1
the	1
Lord;	1
as	1
in	1
despite	1
of	1
Heaven,	1
Or	1
from	1
Heaven,	1
claiming	1
second	1
sovranty;	1
And	1
from	1
rebellion	1
shall	1
derive	1
his	1
name,	1
Though	1
of	1
rebellion	1
others	1
he	1
accuse.	1
He	1
with	1
a	1
crew,	1
whom	1
like	1
ambition	1
joins	1
With	1
him	1
or	1
under	1
him	1
to	1
tyrannize,	1
Marching	1
from	1
Eden	1
towards	1
the	1
west,	1
shall	1
find	1
The	1
plain,	1
wherein	1
a	1
black	1
bituminous	1
gurge	1
Boils	1
out	1
from	1
under	1
ground,	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
Hell:	1
Of	1
brick,	1
and	1
of	1
that	1
stuff,	1
they	1
cast	1
to	1
build	1
A	1
city	1
and	1
tower,	1
whose	1
top	1
may	1
reach	1
to	1
Heaven;	1
And	1
get	1
themselves	1
a	1
name;	1
lest,	1
far	1
dispersed	1
In	1
foreign	1
lands,	1
their	1
memory	1
be	1
lost;	1
Regardless	1
whether	1
good	1
or	1
evil	1
fame.	1
But	1
God,	1
who	1
oft	1
descends	1
to	1
visit	1
men	1
Unseen,	1
and	1
through	1
their	1
habitations	1
walks	1
To	1
mark	1
their	1
doings,	1
them	1
beholding	1
soon,	1
Comes	1
down	1
to	1
see	1
their	1
city,	1
ere	1
the	1
tower	1
Obstruct	1
Heaven-towers,	1
and	1
in	1
derision	1
sets	1
Upon	1
their	1
tongues	1
a	1
various	1
spirit,	1
to	1
rase	1
Quite	1
out	1
their	1
native	1
language;	1
and,	1
instead,	1
To	1
sow	1
a	1
jangling	1
noise	1
of	1
words	1
unknown:	1
Forthwith	1
a	1
hideous	1
gabble	1
rises	1
loud,	1
Among	1
the	1
builders;	1
each	1
to	1
other	1
calls	1
Not	1
understood;	1
till	1
hoarse,	1
and	1
all	1
in	1
rage,	1
As	1
mocked	1
they	1
storm:	1
great	1
laughter	1
was	1
in	1
Heaven,	1
And	1
looking	1
down,	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
hubbub	1
strange,	1
And	1
hear	1
the	1
din:	1
Thus	1
was	1
the	1
building	1
left	1
Ridiculous,	1
and	1
the	1
work	1
Confusion	1
named.	1
Whereto	1
thus	1
Adam,	1
fatherly	1
displeased.	1
O	1
execrable	1
son!	1
so	1
to	1
aspire	1
Above	1
his	1
brethren;	1
to	1
himself	1
assuming	1
Authority	1
usurped,	1
from	1
God	1
not	1
given:	1
He	1
gave	1
us	1
only	1
over	1
beast,	1
fish,	1
fowl,	1
Dominion	1
absolute;	1
that	1
right	1
we	1
hold	1
By	1
his	1
donation;	1
but	1
man	1
over	1
men	1
He	1
made	1
not	1
lord;	1
such	1
title	1
to	1
himself	1
Reserving,	1
human	1
left	1
from	1
human	1
free.	1
But	1
this	1
usurper	1
his	1
encroachment	1
proud	1
Stays	1
not	1
on	1
Man;	1
to	1
God	1
his	1
tower	1
intends	1
Siege	1
and	1
defiance:	1
Wretched	1
man!what	1
food	1
Will	1
he	1
convey	1
up	1
thither,	1
to	1
sustain	1
Himself	1
and	1
his	1
rash	1
army;	1
where	1
thin	1
air	1
Above	1
the	1
clouds	1
will	1
pine	1
his	1
entrails	1
gross,	1
And	1
famish	1
him	1
of	1
breath,	1
if	1
not	1
of	1
bread?	1
To	1
whom	1
thus	1
Michael.	1
Justly	1
thou	1
abhorrest	1
That	1
son,	1
who	1
on	1
the	1
quiet	1
state	1
of	1
men	1
Such	1
trouble	1
brought,	1
affecting	1
to	1
subdue	1
Rational	1
liberty;	1
yet	1
know	1
withal,	1
Since	1
thy	1
original	1
lapse,	1
true	1
liberty	1
Is	1
lost,	1
which	1
always	1
with	1
right	1
reason	1
dwells	1
Twinned,	1
and	1
from	1
her	1
hath	1
no	1
dividual	1
being:	1
Reason	1
in	1
man	1
obscured,	1
or	1
not	1
obeyed,	1
Immediately	1
inordinate	1
desires,	1
And	1
upstart	1
passions,	1
catch	1
the	1
government	1
From	1
reason;	1
and	1
to	1
servitude	1
reduce	1
Man,	1
till	1
then	1
free.	1
Therefore,	1
since	1
he	1
permits	1
Within	1
himself	1
unworthy	1
powers	1
to	1
reign	1
Over	1
free	1
reason,	1
God,	1
in	1
judgement	1
just,	1
Subjects	1
him	1
from	1
without	1
to	1
violent	1
lords;	1
Who	1
oft	1
as	1
undeservedly	1
enthrall	1
His	1
outward	1
freedom:	1
Tyranny	1
must	1
be;	1
Though	1
to	1
the	1
tyrant	1
thereby	1
no	1
excuse.	1
Yet	1
sometimes	1
nations	1
will	1
decline	1
so	1
low	1
From	1
virtue,	1
which	1
is	1
reason,	1
that	1
no	1
wrong,	1
But	1
justice,	1
and	1
some	1
fatal	1
curse	1
annexed,	1
Deprives	1
them	1
of	1
their	1
outward	1
liberty;	1
Their	1
inward	1
lost:	1
Witness	1
the	1
irreverent	1
son	1
Of	1
him	1
who	1
built	1
the	1
ark;	1
who,	1
for	1
the	1
shame	1
Done	1
to	1
his	1
father,	1
heard	1
this	1
heavy	1
curse,	1
Servant	1
of	1
servants,	1
on	1
his	1
vicious	1
race.	1
Thus	1
will	1
this	1
latter,	1
as	1
the	1
former	1
world,	1
Still	1
tend	1
from	1
bad	1
to	1
worse;	1
till	1
God	1
at	1
last,	1
Wearied	1
with	1
their	1
iniquities,	1
withdraw	1
His	1
presence	1
from	1
among	1
them,	1
and	1
avert	1
His	1
holy	1
eyes;	1
resolving	1
from	1
thenceforth	1
To	1
leave	1
them	1
to	1
their	1
own	1
polluted	1
ways;	1
And	1
one	1
peculiar	1
nation	1
to	1
select	1
From	1
all	1
the	1
rest,	1
of	1
whom	1
to	1
be	1
invoked,	1
A	1
nation	1
from	1
one	1
faithful	1
man	1
to	1
spring:	1
Him	1
on	1
this	1
side	1
Euphrates	1
yet	1
residing,	1
Bred	1
up	1
in	1
idol-worship:	1
O,	1
that	1
men	1
(Canst	1
thou	1
believe?)	1
should	1
be	1
so	1
stupid	1
grown,	1
While	1
yet	1
the	1
patriarch	1
lived,	1
who	1
'scaped	1
the	1
flood,	1
As	1
to	1
forsake	1
the	1
living	1
God,	1
and	1
fall	1
To	1
worship	1
their	1
own	1
work	1
in	1
wood	1
and	1
stone	1
For	1
Gods!	1
Yet	1
him	1
God	1
the	1
Most	1
High	1
vouchsafes	1
To	1
call	1
by	1
vision,	1
from	1
his	1
father's	1
house,	1
His	1
kindred,	1
and	1
false	1
Gods,	1
into	1
a	1
land	1
Which	1
he	1
will	1
show	1
him;	1
and	1
from	1
him	1
will	1
raise	1
A	1
mighty	1
nation;	1
and	1
upon	1
him	1
shower	1
His	1
benediction	1
so,	1
that	1
in	1
his	1
seed	1
All	1
nations	1
shall	1
be	1
blest:	1
he	1
straight	1
obeys;	1
Not	1
knowing	1
to	1
what	1
land,	1
yet	1
firm	1
believes:	1
I	1
see	1
him,	1
but	1
thou	1
canst	1
not,	1
with	1
what	1
faith	1
He	1
leaves	1
his	1
Gods,	1
his	1
friends,	1
and	1
native	1
soil,	1
Ur	1
of	1
Chaldaea,	1
passing	1
now	1
the	1
ford	1
To	1
Haran;	1
after	1
him	1
a	1
cumbrous	1
train	1
Of	1
herds	1
and	1
flocks,	1
and	1
numerous	1
servitude;	1
Not	1
wandering	1
poor,	1
but	1
trusting	1
all	1
his	1
wealth	1
With	1
God,	1
who	1
called	1
him,	1
in	1
a	1
land	1
unknown.	1
Canaan	1
he	1
now	1
attains;	1
I	1
see	1
his	1
tents	1
Pitched	1
about	1
Sechem,	1
and	1
the	1
neighbouring	1
plain	1
Of	1
Moreh;	1
there	1
by	1
promise	1
he	1
receives	1
Gift	1
to	1
his	1
progeny	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
land,	1
From	1
Hameth	1
northward	1
to	1
the	1
Desart	1
south;	1
(Things	1
by	1
their	1
names	1
I	1
call,	1
though	1
yet	1
unnamed;)	1
From	1
Hermon	1
east	1
to	1
the	1
great	1
western	1
Sea;	1
Mount	1
Hermon,	1
yonder	1
sea;	1
each	1
place	1
behold	1
In	1
prospect,	1
as	1
I	1
point	1
them;	1
on	1
the	1
shore	1
Mount	1
Carmel;	1
here,	1
the	1
double-founted	1
stream,	1
Jordan,	1
true	1
limit	1
eastward;	1
but	1
his	1
sons	1
Shall	1
dwell	1
to	1
Senir,	1
that	1
long	1
ridge	1
of	1
hills.	1
This	1
ponder,	1
that	1
all	1
nations	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
Shall	1
in	1
his	1
seed	1
be	1
blessed:	1
By	1
that	1
seed	1
Is	1
meant	1
thy	1
great	1
Deliverer,	1
who	1
shall	1
bruise	1
The	1
Serpent's	1
head;	1
whereof	1
to	1
thee	1
anon	1
Plainlier	1
shall	1
be	1
revealed.	1
This	1
patriarch	1
blest,	1
Whom	1
faithful	1
Abraham	1
due	1
time	1
shall	1
call,	1
A	1
son,	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
son	1
a	1
grand-child,	1
leaves;	1
Like	1
him	1
in	1
faith,	1
in	1
wisdom,	1
and	1
renown:	1
The	1
grandchild,	1
with	1
twelve	1
sons	1
increased,	1
departs	1
From	1
Canaan	1
to	1
a	1
land	1
hereafter	1
called	1
Egypt,	1
divided	1
by	1
the	1
river	1
Nile	1
See	1
where	1
it	1
flows,	1
disgorging	1
at	1
seven	1
mouths	1
Into	1
the	1
sea.	1
To	1
sojourn	1
in	1
that	1
land	1
He	1
comes,	1
invited	1
by	1
a	1
younger	1
son	1
In	1
time	1
of	1
dearth,	1
a	1
son	1
whose	1
worthy	1
deeds	1
Raise	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
second	1
in	1
that	1
realm	1
Of	1
Pharaoh.	1
There	1
he	1
dies,	1
and	1
leaves	1
his	1
race	1
Growing	1
into	1
a	1
nation,	1
and	1
now	1
grown	1
Suspected	1
to	1
a	1
sequent	1
king,	1
who	1
seeks	1
To	1
stop	1
their	1
overgrowth,	1
as	1
inmate	1
guests	1
Too	1
numerous;	1
whence	1
of	1
guests	1
he	1
makes	1
them	1
slaves	1
Inhospitably,	1
and	1
kills	1
their	1
infant	1
males:	1
Till	1
by	1
two	1
brethren	1
(these	1
two	1
brethren	1
call	1
Moses	1
and	1
Aaron)	1
sent	1
from	1
God	1
to	1
claim	1
His	1
people	1
from	1
enthralment,	1
they	1
return,	1
With	1
glory	1
and	1
spoil,	1
back	1
to	1
their	1
promised	1
land.	1
But	1
first,	1
the	1
lawless	1
tyrant,	1
who	1
denies	1
To	1
know	1
their	1
God,	1
or	1
message	1
to	1
regard,	1
Must	1
be	1
compelled	1
by	1
signs	1
and	1
judgements	1
dire;	1
To	1
blood	1
unshed	1
the	1
rivers	1
must	1
be	1
turned;	1
Frogs,	1
lice,	1
and	1
flies,	1
must	1
all	1
his	1
palace	1
fill	1
With	1
loathed	1
intrusion,	1
and	1
fill	1
all	1
the	1
land;	1
His	1
cattle	1
must	1
of	1
rot	1
and	1
murren	1
die;	1
Botches	1
and	1
blains	1
must	1
all	1
his	1
flesh	1
emboss,	1
And	1
all	1
his	1
people;	1
thunder	1
mixed	1
with	1
hail,	1
Hail	1
mixed	1
with	1
fire,	1
must	1
rend	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
sky,	1
And	1
wheel	1
on	1
the	1
earth,	1
devouring	1
where	1
it	1
rolls;	1
What	1
it	1
devours	1
not,	1
herb,	1
or	1
fruit,	1
or	1
grain,	1
A	1
darksome	1
cloud	1
of	1
locusts	1
swarming	1
down	1
Must	1
eat,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
leave	1
nothing	1
green;	1
Darkness	1
must	1
overshadow	1
all	1
his	1
bounds,	1
Palpable	1
darkness,	1
and	1
blot	1
out	1
three	1
days;	1
Last,	1
with	1
one	1
midnight	1
stroke,	1
all	1
the	1
first-born	1
Of	1
Egypt	1
must	1
lie	1
dead.	1
Thus	1
with	1
ten	1
wounds	1
The	1
river-dragon	1
tamed	1
at	1
length	1
submits	1
To	1
let	1
his	1
sojourners	1
depart,	1
and	1
oft	1
Humbles	1
his	1
stubborn	1
heart;	1
but	1
still,	1
as	1
ice	1
More	1
hardened	1
after	1
thaw;	1
till,	1
in	1
his	1
rage	1
Pursuing	1
whom	1
he	1
late	1
dismissed,	1
the	1
sea	1
Swallows	1
him	1
with	1
his	1
host;	1
but	1
them	1
lets	1
pass,	1
As	1
on	1
dry	1
land,	1
between	1
two	1
crystal	1
walls;	1
Awed	1
by	1
the	1
rod	1
of	1
Moses	1
so	1
to	1
stand	1
Divided,	1
till	1
his	1
rescued	1
gain	1
their	1
shore:	1
Such	1
wondrous	1
power	1
God	1
to	1
his	1
saint	1
will	1
lend,	1
Though	1
present	1
in	1
his	1
Angel;	1
who	1
shall	1
go	1
Before	1
them	1
in	1
a	1
cloud,	1
and	1
pillar	1
of	1
fire;	1
By	1
day	1
a	1
cloud,	1
by	1
night	1
a	1
pillar	1
of	1
fire;	1
To	1
guide	1
them	1
in	1
their	1
journey,	1
and	1
remove	1
Behind	1
them,	1
while	1
the	1
obdurate	1
king	1
pursues:	1
All	1
night	1
he	1
will	1
pursue;	1
but	1
his	1
approach	1
Darkness	1
defends	1
between	1
till	1
morning	1
watch;	1
Then	1
through	1
the	1
fiery	1
pillar,	1
and	1
the	1
cloud,	1
God	1
looking	1
forth	1
will	1
trouble	1
all	1
his	1
host,	1
And	1
craze	1
their	1
chariot-wheels:	1
when	1
by	1
command	1
Moses	1
once	1
more	1
his	1
potent	1
rod	1
extends	1
Over	1
the	1
sea;	1
the	1
sea	1
his	1
rod	1
obeys;	1
On	1
their	1
embattled	1
ranks	1
the	1
waves	1
return,	1
And	1
overwhelm	1
their	1
war:	1
The	1
race	1
elect	1
Safe	1
toward	1
Canaan	1
from	1
the	1
shore	1
advance	1
Through	1
the	1
wild	1
Desart,	1
not	1
the	1
readiest	1
way;	1
Lest,	1
entering	1
on	1
the	1
Canaanite	1
alarmed,	1
War	1
terrify	1
them	1
inexpert,	1
and	1
fear	1
Return	1
them	1
back	1
to	1
Egypt,	1
choosing	1
rather	1
Inglorious	1
life	1
with	1
servitude;	1
for	1
life	1
To	1
noble	1
and	1
ignoble	1
is	1
more	1
sweet	1
Untrained	1
in	1
arms,	1
where	1
rashness	1
leads	1
not	1
on.	1
This	1
also	1
shall	1
they	1
gain	1
by	1
their	1
delay	1
In	1
the	1
wide	1
wilderness;	1
there	1
they	1
shall	1
found	1
Their	1
government,	1
and	1
their	1
great	1
senate	1
choose	1
Through	1
the	1
twelve	1
tribes,	1
to	1
rule	1
by	1
laws	1
ordained:	1
God	1
from	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
Sinai,	1
whose	1
gray	1
top	1
Shall	1
tremble,	1
he	1
descending,	1
will	1
himself	1
In	1
thunder,	1
lightning,	1
and	1
loud	1
trumpets'	1
sound,	1
Ordain	1
them	1
laws;	1
part,	1
such	1
as	1
appertain	1
To	1
civil	1
justice;	1
part,	1
religious	1
rites	1
Of	1
sacrifice;	1
informing	1
them,	1
by	1
types	1
And	1
shadows,	1
of	1
that	1
destined	1
Seed	1
to	1
bruise	1
The	1
Serpent,	1
by	1
what	1
means	1
he	1
shall	1
achieve	1
Mankind's	1
deliverance.	1
But	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
God	1
To	1
mortal	1
ear	1
is	1
dreadful:	1
They	1
beseech	1
That	1
Moses	1
might	1
report	1
to	1
them	1
his	1
will,	1
And	1
terrour	1
cease;	1
he	1
grants	1
what	1
they	1
besought,	1
Instructed	1
that	1
to	1
God	1
is	1
no	1
access	1
Without	1
Mediator,	1
whose	1
high	1
office	1
now	1
Moses	1
in	1
figure	1
bears;	1
to	1
introduce	1
One	1
greater,	1
of	1
whose	1
day	1
he	1
shall	1
foretel,	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
Prophets	1
in	1
their	1
age	1
the	1
times	1
Of	1
great	1
Messiah	1
shall	1
sing.	1
Thus,	1
laws	1
and	1
rites	1
Established,	1
such	1
delight	1
hath	1
God	1
in	1
Men	1
Obedient	1
to	1
his	1
will,	1
that	1
he	1
vouchsafes	1
Among	1
them	1
to	1
set	1
up	1
his	1
tabernacle;	1
The	1
Holy	1
One	1
with	1
mortal	1
Men	1
to	1
dwell:	1
By	1
his	1
prescript	1
a	1
sanctuary	1
is	1
framed	1
Of	1
cedar,	1
overlaid	1
with	1
gold;	1
therein	1
An	1
ark,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
ark	1
his	1
testimony,	1
The	1
records	1
of	1
his	1
covenant;	1
over	1
these	1
A	1
mercy-seat	1
of	1
gold,	1
between	1
the	1
wings	1
Of	1
two	1
bright	1
Cherubim;	1
before	1
him	1
burn	1
Seven	1
lamps	1
as	1
in	1
a	1
zodiack	1
representing	1
The	1
heavenly	1
fires;	1
over	1
the	1
tent	1
a	1
cloud	1
Shall	1
rest	1
by	1
day,	1
a	1
fiery	1
gleam	1
by	1
night;	1
Save	1
when	1
they	1
journey,	1
and	1
at	1
length	1
they	1
come,	1
Conducted	1
by	1
his	1
Angel,	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
Promised	1
to	1
Abraham	1
and	1
his	1
seed:--The	1
rest	1
Were	1
long	1
to	1
tell;	1
how	1
many	1
battles	1
fought	1
How	1
many	1
kings	1
destroyed;	1
and	1
kingdoms	1
won;	1
Or	1
how	1
the	1
sun	1
shall	1
in	1
mid	1
Heaven	1
stand	1
still	1
A	1
day	1
entire,	1
and	1
night's	1
due	1
course	1
adjourn,	1
Man's	1
voice	1
commanding,	1
'Sun,	1
in	1
Gibeon	1
stand,	1
'And	1
thou	1
moon	1
in	1
the	1
vale	1
of	1
Aialon,	1
'Till	1
Israel	1
overcome!	1
so	1
call	1
the	1
third	1
From	1
Abraham,	1
son	1
of	1
Isaac;	1
and	1
from	1
him	1
His	1
whole	1
descent,	1
who	1
thus	1
shall	1
Canaan	1
win.	1
Here	1
Adam	1
interposed.	1
O	1
sent	1
from	1
Heaven,	1
Enlightener	1
of	1
my	1
darkness,	1
gracious	1
things	1
Thou	1
hast	1
revealed;	1
those	1
chiefly,	1
which	1
concern	1
Just	1
Abraham	1
and	1
his	1
seed:	1
now	1
first	1
I	1
find	1
Mine	1
eyes	1
true-opening,	1
and	1
my	1
heart	1
much	1
eased;	1
Erewhile	1
perplexed	1
with	1
thoughts,	1
what	1
would	1
become	1
Of	1
me	1
and	1
all	1
mankind:	1
But	1
now	1
I	1
see	1
His	1
day,	1
in	1
whom	1
all	1
nations	1
shall	1
be	1
blest;	1
Favour	1
unmerited	1
by	1
me,	1
who	1
sought	1
Forbidden	1
knowledge	1
by	1
forbidden	1
means.	1
This	1
yet	1
I	1
apprehend	1
not,	1
why	1
to	1
those	1
Among	1
whom	1
God	1
will	1
deign	1
to	1
dwell	1
on	1
earth	1
So	1
many	1
and	1
so	1
various	1
laws	1
are	1
given;	1
So	1
many	1
laws	1
argue	1
so	1
many	1
sins	1
Among	1
them;	1
how	1
can	1
God	1
with	1
such	1
reside?	1
To	1
whom	1
thus	1
Michael.	1
Doubt	1
not	1
but	1
that	1
sin	1
Will	1
reign	1
among	1
them,	1
as	1
of	1
thee	1
begot;	1
And	1
therefore	1
was	1
law	1
given	1
them,	1
to	1
evince	1
Their	1
natural	1
pravity,	1
by	1
stirring	1
up	1
Sin	1
against	1
law	1
to	1
fight:	1
that	1
when	1
they	1
see	1
Law	1
can	1
discover	1
sin,	1
but	1
not	1
remove,	1
Save	1
by	1
those	1
shadowy	1
expiations	1
weak,	1
The	1
blood	1
of	1
bulls	1
and	1
goats,	1
they	1
may	1
conclude	1
Some	1
blood	1
more	1
precious	1
must	1
be	1
paid	1
for	1
Man;	1
Just	1
for	1
unjust;	1
that,	1
in	1
such	1
righteousness	1
To	1
them	1
by	1
faith	1
imputed,	1
they	1
may	1
find	1
Justification	1
towards	1
God,	1
and	1
peace	1
Of	1
conscience;	1
which	1
the	1
law	1
by	1
ceremonies	1
Cannot	1
appease;	1
nor	1
Man	1
the	1
mortal	1
part	1
Perform;	1
and,	1
not	1
performing,	1
cannot	1
live.	1
So	1
law	1
appears	1
imperfect;	1
and	1
but	1
given	1
With	1
purpose	1
to	1
resign	1
them,	1
in	1
full	1
time,	1
Up	1
to	1
a	1
better	1
covenant;	1
disciplined	1
From	1
shadowy	1
types	1
to	1
truth;	1
from	1
flesh	1
to	1
spirit;	1
From	1
imposition	1
of	1
strict	1
laws	1
to	1
free	1
Acceptance	1
of	1
large	1
grace;	1
from	1
servile	1
fear	1
To	1
filial;	1
works	1
of	1
law	1
to	1
works	1
of	1
faith.	1
And	1
therefore	1
shall	1
not	1
Moses,	1
though	1
of	1
God	1
Highly	1
beloved,	1
being	1
but	1
the	1
minister	1
Of	1
law,	1
his	1
people	1
into	1
Canaan	1
lead;	1
But	1
Joshua,	1
whom	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
Jesus	1
call,	1
His	1
name	1
and	1
office	1
bearing,	1
who	1
shall	1
quell	1
The	1
adversary-Serpent,	1
and	1
bring	1
back	1
Through	1
the	1
world's	1
wilderness	1
long-wandered	1
Man	1
Safe	1
to	1
eternal	1
Paradise	1
of	1
rest.	1
Mean	1
while	1
they,	1
in	1
their	1
earthly	1
Canaan	1
placed,	1
Long	1
time	1
shall	1
dwell	1
and	1
prosper,	1
but	1
when	1
sins	1
National	1
interrupt	1
their	1
publick	1
peace,	1
Provoking	1
God	1
to	1
raise	1
them	1
enemies;	1
From	1
whom	1
as	1
oft	1
he	1
saves	1
them	1
penitent	1
By	1
Judges	1
first,	1
then	1
under	1
Kings;	1
of	1
whom	1
The	1
second,	1
both	1
for	1
piety	1
renowned	1
And	1
puissant	1
deeds,	1
a	1
promise	1
shall	1
receive	1
Irrevocable,	1
that	1
his	1
regal	1
throne	1
For	1
ever	1
shall	1
endure;	1
the	1
like	1
shall	1
sing	1
All	1
Prophecy,	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
royal	1
stock	1
Of	1
David	1
(so	1
I	1
name	1
this	1
king)	1
shall	1
rise	1
A	1
Son,	1
the	1
Woman's	1
seed	1
to	1
thee	1
foretold,	1
Foretold	1
to	1
Abraham,	1
as	1
in	1
whom	1
shall	1
trust	1
All	1
nations;	1
and	1
to	1
kings	1
foretold,	1
of	1
kings	1
The	1
last;	1
for	1
of	1
his	1
reign	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
end.	1
But	1
first,	1
a	1
long	1
succession	1
must	1
ensue;	1
And	1
his	1
next	1
son,	1
for	1
wealth	1
and	1
wisdom	1
famed,	1
The	1
clouded	1
ark	1
of	1
God,	1
till	1
then	1
in	1
tents	1
Wandering,	1
shall	1
in	1
a	1
glorious	1
temple	1
enshrine.	1
Such	1
follow	1
him,	1
as	1
shall	1
be	1
registered	1
Part	1
good,	1
part	1
bad;	1
of	1
bad	1
the	1
longer	1
scroll;	1
Whose	1
foul	1
idolatries,	1
and	1
other	1
faults	1
Heaped	1
to	1
the	1
popular	1
sum,	1
will	1
so	1
incense	1
God,	1
as	1
to	1
leave	1
them,	1
and	1
expose	1
their	1
land,	1
Their	1
city,	1
his	1
temple,	1
and	1
his	1
holy	1
ark,	1
With	1
all	1
his	1
sacred	1
things,	1
a	1
scorn	1
and	1
prey	1
To	1
that	1
proud	1
city,	1
whose	1
high	1
walls	1
thou	1
sawest	1
Left	1
in	1
confusion;	1
Babylon	1
thence	1
called.	1
There	1
in	1
captivity	1
he	1
lets	1
them	1
dwell	1
The	1
space	1
of	1
seventy	1
years;	1
then	1
brings	1
them	1
back,	1
Remembering	1
mercy,	1
and	1
his	1
covenant	1
sworn	1
To	1
David,	1
stablished	1
as	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Heaven.	1
Returned	1
from	1
Babylon	1
by	1
leave	1
of	1
kings	1
Their	1
lords,	1
whom	1
God	1
disposed,	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God	1
They	1
first	1
re-edify;	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
while	1
In	1
mean	1
estate	1
live	1
moderate;	1
till,	1
grown	1
In	1
wealth	1
and	1
multitude,	1
factious	1
they	1
grow;	1
But	1
first	1
among	1
the	1
priests	1
dissention	1
springs,	1
Men	1
who	1
attend	1
the	1
altar,	1
and	1
should	1
most	1
Endeavour	1
peace:	1
their	1
strife	1
pollution	1
brings	1
Upon	1
the	1
temple	1
itself:	1
at	1
last	1
they	1
seise	1
The	1
scepter,	1
and	1
regard	1
not	1
David's	1
sons;	1
Then	1
lose	1
it	1
to	1
a	1
stranger,	1
that	1
the	1
true	1
Anointed	1
King	1
Messiah	1
might	1
be	1
born	1
Barred	1
of	1
his	1
right;	1
yet	1
at	1
his	1
birth	1
a	1
star,	1
Unseen	1
before	1
in	1
Heaven,	1
proclaims	1
him	1
come;	1
And	1
guides	1
the	1
eastern	1
sages,	1
who	1
inquire	1
His	1
place,	1
to	1
offer	1
incense,	1
myrrh,	1
and	1
gold:	1
His	1
place	1
of	1
birth	1
a	1
solemn	1
Angel	1
tells	1
To	1
simple	1
shepherds,	1
keeping	1
watch	1
by	1
night;	1
They	1
gladly	1
thither	1
haste,	1
and	1
by	1
a	1
quire	1
Of	1
squadroned	1
Angels	1
hear	1
his	1
carol	1
sung.	1
A	1
virgin	1
is	1
his	1
mother,	1
but	1
his	1
sire	1
The	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
Most	1
High:	1
He	1
shall	1
ascend	1
The	1
throne	1
hereditary,	1
and	1
bound	1
his	1
reign	1
With	1
Earth's	1
wide	1
bounds,	1
his	1
glory	1
with	1
the	1
Heavens.	1
He	1
ceased,	1
discerning	1
Adam	1
with	1
such	1
joy	1
Surcharged,	1
as	1
had	1
like	1
grief	1
been	1
dewed	1
in	1
tears,	1
Without	1
the	1
vent	1
of	1
words;	1
which	1
these	1
he	1
breathed.	1
O	1
prophet	1
of	1
glad	1
tidings,	1
finisher	1
Of	1
utmost	1
hope!	1
now	1
clear	1
I	1
understand	1
What	1
oft	1
my	1
steadiest	1
thoughts	1
have	1
searched	1
in	1
vain;	1
Why	1
our	1
great	1
Expectation	1
should	1
be	1
called	1
The	1
seed	1
of	1
Woman:	1
Virgin	1
Mother,	1
hail,	1
High	1
in	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
Heaven;	1
yet	1
from	1
my	1
loins	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
proceed,	1
and	1
from	1
thy	1
womb	1
the	1
Son	1
Of	1
God	1
Most	1
High:	1
so	1
God	1
with	1
Man	1
unites!	1
Needs	1
must	1
the	1
Serpent	1
now	1
his	1
capital	1
bruise	1
Expect	1
with	1
mortal	1
pain:	1
Say	1
where	1
and	1
when	1
Their	1
fight,	1
what	1
stroke	1
shall	1
bruise	1
the	1
victor's	1
heel.	1
To	1
whom	1
thus	1
Michael.	1
Dream	1
not	1
of	1
their	1
fight,	1
As	1
of	1
a	1
duel,	1
or	1
the	1
local	1
wounds	1
Of	1
head	1
or	1
heel:	1
Not	1
therefore	1
joins	1
the	1
Son	1
Manhood	1
to	1
Godhead,	1
with	1
more	1
strength	1
to	1
foil	1
Thy	1
enemy;	1
nor	1
so	1
is	1
overcome	1
Satan,	1
whose	1
fall	1
from	1
Heaven,	1
a	1
deadlier	1
bruise,	1
Disabled,	1
not	1
to	1
give	1
thee	1
thy	1
death's	1
wound:	1
Which	1
he,	1
who	1
comes	1
thy	1
Saviour,	1
shall	1
recure,	1
Not	1
by	1
destroying	1
Satan,	1
but	1
his	1
works	1
In	1
thee,	1
and	1
in	1
thy	1
seed:	1
Nor	1
can	1
this	1
be,	1
But	1
by	1
fulfilling	1
that	1
which	1
thou	1
didst	1
want,	1
Obedience	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
God,	1
imposed	1
On	1
penalty	1
of	1
death,	1
and	1
suffering	1
death;	1
The	1
penalty	1
to	1
thy	1
transgression	1
due,	1
And	1
due	1
to	1
theirs	1
which	1
out	1
of	1
thine	1
will	1
grow:	1
So	1
only	1
can	1
high	1
Justice	1
rest	1
appaid.	1
The	1
law	1
of	1
God	1
exact	1
he	1
shall	1
fulfil	1
Both	1
by	1
obedience	1
and	1
by	1
love,	1
though	1
love	1
Alone	1
fulfil	1
the	1
law;	1
thy	1
punishment	1
He	1
shall	1
endure,	1
by	1
coming	1
in	1
the	1
flesh	1
To	1
a	1
reproachful	1
life,	1
and	1
cursed	1
death;	1
Proclaiming	1
life	1
to	1
all	1
who	1
shall	1
believe	1
In	1
his	1
redemption;	1
and	1
that	1
his	1
obedience,	1
Imputed,	1
becomes	1
theirs	1
by	1
faith;	1
his	1
merits	1
To	1
save	1
them,	1
not	1
their	1
own,	1
though	1
legal,	1
works.	1
For	1
this	1
he	1
shall	1
live	1
hated,	1
be	1
blasphemed,	1
Seised	1
on	1
by	1
force,	1
judged,	1
and	1
to	1
death	1
condemned	1
A	1
shameful	1
and	1
accursed,	1
nailed	1
to	1
the	1
cross	1
By	1
his	1
own	1
nation;	1
slain	1
for	1
bringing	1
life:	1
But	1
to	1
the	1
cross	1
he	1
nails	1
thy	1
enemies,	1
The	1
law	1
that	1
is	1
against	1
thee,	1
and	1
the	1
sins	1
Of	1
all	1
mankind,	1
with	1
him	1
there	1
crucified,	1
Never	1
to	1
hurt	1
them	1
more	1
who	1
rightly	1
trust	1
In	1
this	1
his	1
satisfaction;	1
so	1
he	1
dies,	1
But	1
soon	1
revives;	1
Death	1
over	1
him	1
no	1
power	1
Shall	1
long	1
usurp;	1
ere	1
the	1
third	1
dawning	1
light	1
Return,	1
the	1
stars	1
of	1
morn	1
shall	1
see	1
him	1
rise	1
Out	1
of	1
his	1
grave,	1
fresh	1
as	1
the	1
dawning	1
light,	1
Thy	1
ransom	1
paid,	1
which	1
Man	1
from	1
death	1
redeems,	1
His	1
death	1
for	1
Man,	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
offered	1
life	1
Neglect	1
not,	1
and	1
the	1
benefit	1
embrace	1
By	1
faith	1
not	1
void	1
of	1
works:	1
This	1
God-like	1
act	1
Annuls	1
thy	1
doom,	1
the	1
death	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
have	1
died,	1
In	1
sin	1
for	1
ever	1
lost	1
from	1
life;	1
this	1
act	1
Shall	1
bruise	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
Satan,	1
crush	1
his	1
strength,	1
Defeating	1
Sin	1
and	1
Death,	1
his	1
two	1
main	1
arms;	1
And	1
fix	1
far	1
deeper	1
in	1
his	1
head	1
their	1
stings	1
Than	1
temporal	1
death	1
shall	1
bruise	1
the	1
victor's	1
heel,	1
Or	1
theirs	1
whom	1
he	1
redeems;	1
a	1
death,	1
like	1
sleep,	1
A	1
gentle	1
wafting	1
to	1
immortal	1
life.	1
Nor	1
after	1
resurrection	1
shall	1
he	1
stay	1
Longer	1
on	1
earth,	1
than	1
certain	1
times	1
to	1
appear	1
To	1
his	1
disciples,	1
men	1
who	1
in	1
his	1
life	1
Still	1
followed	1
him;	1
to	1
them	1
shall	1
leave	1
in	1
charge	1
To	1
teach	1
all	1
nations	1
what	1
of	1
him	1
they	1
learned	1
And	1
his	1
salvation;	1
them	1
who	1
shall	1
believe	1
Baptizing	1
in	1
the	1
profluent	1
stream,	1
the	1
sign	1
Of	1
washing	1
them	1
from	1
guilt	1
of	1
sin	1
to	1
life	1
Pure,	1
and	1
in	1
mind	1
prepared,	1
if	1
so	1
befall,	1
For	1
death,	1
like	1
that	1
which	1
the	1
Redeemer	1
died.	1
All	1
nations	1
they	1
shall	1
teach;	1
for,	1
from	1
that	1
day,	1
Not	1
only	1
to	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Abraham's	1
loins	1
Salvation	1
shall	1
be	1
preached,	1
but	1
to	1
the	1
sons	1
Of	1
Abraham's	1
faith	1
wherever	1
through	1
the	1
world;	1
So	1
in	1
his	1
seed	1
all	1
nations	1
shall	1
be	1
blest.	1
Then	1
to	1
the	1
Heaven	1
of	1
Heavens	1
he	1
shall	1
ascend	1
With	1
victory,	1
triumphing	1
through	1
the	1
air	1
Over	1
his	1
foes	1
and	1
thine;	1
there	1
shall	1
surprise	1
The	1
Serpent,	1
prince	1
of	1
air,	1
and	1
drag	1
in	1
chains	1
Through	1
all	1
his	1
realm,	1
and	1
there	1
confounded	1
leave;	1
Then	1
enter	1
into	1
glory,	1
and	1
resume	1
His	1
seat	1
at	1
God's	1
right	1
hand,	1
exalted	1
high	1
Above	1
all	1
names	1
in	1
Heaven;	1
and	1
thence	1
shall	1
come,	1
When	1
this	1
world's	1
dissolution	1
shall	1
be	1
ripe,	1
With	1
glory	1
and	1
power	1
to	1
judge	1
both	1
quick	1
and	1
dead;	1
To	1
judge	1
the	1
unfaithful	1
dead,	1
but	1
to	1
reward	1
His	1
faithful,	1
and	1
receive	1
them	1
into	1
bliss,	1
Whether	1
in	1
Heaven	1
or	1
Earth;	1
for	1
then	1
the	1
Earth	1
Shall	1
all	1
be	1
Paradise,	1
far	1
happier	1
place	1
Than	1
this	1
of	1
Eden,	1
and	1
far	1
happier	1
days.	1
So	1
spake	1
the	1
Arch-Angel	1
Michael;	1
then	1
paused,	1
As	1
at	1
the	1
world's	1
great	1
period;	1
and	1
our	1
sire,	1
Replete	1
with	1
joy	1
and	1
wonder,	1
thus	1
replied.	1
O	1
Goodness	1
infinite,	1
Goodness	1
immense!	1
That	1
all	1
this	1
good	1
of	1
evil	1
shall	1
produce,	1
And	1
evil	1
turn	1
to	1
good;	1
more	1
wonderful	1
Than	1
that	1
which	1
by	1
creation	1
first	1
brought	1
forth	1
Light	1
out	1
of	1
darkness!	1
Full	1
of	1
doubt	1
I	1
stand,	1
Whether	1
I	1
should	1
repent	1
me	1
now	1
of	1
sin	1
By	1
me	1
done,	1
and	1
occasioned;	1
or	1
rejoice	1
Much	1
more,	1
that	1
much	1
more	1
good	1
thereof	1
shall	1
spring;	1
To	1
God	1
more	1
glory,	1
more	1
good-will	1
to	1
Men	1
From	1
God,	1
and	1
over	1
wrath	1
grace	1
shall	1
abound.	1
But	1
say,	1
if	1
our	1
Deliverer	1
up	1
to	1
Heaven	1
Must	1
re-ascend,	1
what	1
will	1
betide	1
the	1
few	1
His	1
faithful,	1
left	1
among	1
the	1
unfaithful	1
herd,	1
The	1
enemies	1
of	1
truth?	1
Who	1
then	1
shall	1
guide	1
His	1
people,	1
who	1
defend?	1
Will	1
they	1
not	1
deal	1
Worse	1
with	1
his	1
followers	1
than	1
with	1
him	1
they	1
dealt?	1
Be	1
sure	1
they	1
will,	1
said	1
the	1
Angel;	1
but	1
from	1
Heaven	1
He	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
a	1
Comforter	1
will	1
send,	1
The	1
promise	1
of	1
the	1
Father,	1
who	1
shall	1
dwell	1
His	1
Spirit	1
within	1
them;	1
and	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
faith,	1
Working	1
through	1
love,	1
upon	1
their	1
hearts	1
shall	1
write,	1
To	1
guide	1
them	1
in	1
all	1
truth;	1
and	1
also	1
arm	1
With	1
spiritual	1
armour,	1
able	1
to	1
resist	1
Satan's	1
assaults,	1
and	1
quench	1
his	1
fiery	1
darts;	1
What	1
man	1
can	1
do	1
against	1
them,	1
not	1
afraid,	1
Though	1
to	1
the	1
death;	1
against	1
such	1
cruelties	1
With	1
inward	1
consolations	1
recompensed,	1
And	1
oft	1
supported	1
so	1
as	1
shall	1
amaze	1
Their	1
proudest	1
persecutors:	1
For	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
Poured	1
first	1
on	1
his	1
Apostles,	1
whom	1
he	1
sends	1
To	1
evangelize	1
the	1
nations,	1
then	1
on	1
all	1
Baptized,	1
shall	1
them	1
with	1
wonderous	1
gifts	1
endue	1
To	1
speak	1
all	1
tongues,	1
and	1
do	1
all	1
miracles,	1
As	1
did	1
their	1
Lord	1
before	1
them.	1
Thus	1
they	1
win	1
Great	1
numbers	1
of	1
each	1
nation	1
to	1
receive	1
With	1
joy	1
the	1
tidings	1
brought	1
from	1
Heaven:	1
At	1
length	1
Their	1
ministry	1
performed,	1
and	1
race	1
well	1
run,	1
Their	1
doctrine	1
and	1
their	1
story	1
written	1
left,	1
They	1
die;	1
but	1
in	1
their	1
room,	1
as	1
they	1
forewarn,	1
Wolves	1
shall	1
succeed	1
for	1
teachers,	1
grievous	1
wolves,	1
Who	1
all	1
the	1
sacred	1
mysteries	1
of	1
Heaven	1
To	1
their	1
own	1
vile	1
advantages	1
shall	1
turn	1
Of	1
lucre	1
and	1
ambition;	1
and	1
the	1
truth	1
With	1
superstitions	1
and	1
traditions	1
taint,	1
Left	1
only	1
in	1
those	1
written	1
records	1
pure,	1
Though	1
not	1
but	1
by	1
the	1
Spirit	1
understood.	1
Then	1
shall	1
they	1
seek	1
to	1
avail	1
themselves	1
of	1
names,	1
Places,	1
and	1
titles,	1
and	1
with	1
these	1
to	1
join	1
Secular	1
power;	1
though	1
feigning	1
still	1
to	1
act	1
By	1
spiritual,	1
to	1
themselves	1
appropriating	1
The	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God,	1
promised	1
alike	1
and	1
given	1
To	1
all	1
believers;	1
and,	1
from	1
that	1
pretence,	1
Spiritual	1
laws	1
by	1
carnal	1
power	1
shall	1
force	1
On	1
every	1
conscience;	1
laws	1
which	1
none	1
shall	1
find	1
Left	1
them	1
inrolled,	1
or	1
what	1
the	1
Spirit	1
within	1
Shall	1
on	1
the	1
heart	1
engrave.	1
What	1
will	1
they	1
then	1
But	1
force	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
Grace	1
itself,	1
and	1
bind	1
His	1
consort	1
Liberty?	1
what,	1
but	1
unbuild	1
His	1
living	1
temples,	1
built	1
by	1
faith	1
to	1
stand,	1
Their	1
own	1
faith,	1
not	1
another's?	1
for,	1
on	1
earth,	1
Who	1
against	1
faith	1
and	1
conscience	1
can	1
be	1
heard	1
Infallible?	1
yet	1
many	1
will	1
presume:	1
Whence	1
heavy	1
persecution	1
shall	1
arise	1
On	1
all,	1
who	1
in	1
the	1
worship	1
persevere	1
Of	1
spirit	1
and	1
truth;	1
the	1
rest,	1
far	1
greater	1
part,	1
Will	1
deem	1
in	1
outward	1
rites	1
and	1
specious	1
forms	1
Religion	1
satisfied;	1
Truth	1
shall	1
retire	1
Bestuck	1
with	1
slanderous	1
darts,	1
and	1
works	1
of	1
faith	1
Rarely	1
be	1
found:	1
So	1
shall	1
the	1
world	1
go	1
on,	1
To	1
good	1
malignant,	1
to	1
bad	1
men	1
benign;	1
Under	1
her	1
own	1
weight	1
groaning;	1
till	1
the	1
day	1
Appear	1
of	1
respiration	1
to	1
the	1
just,	1
And	1
vengeance	1
to	1
the	1
wicked,	1
at	1
return	1
Of	1
him	1
so	1
lately	1
promised	1
to	1
thy	1
aid,	1
The	1
Woman's	1
Seed;	1
obscurely	1
then	1
foretold,	1
Now	1
ampler	1
known	1
thy	1
Saviour	1
and	1
thy	1
Lord;	1
Last,	1
in	1
the	1
clouds,	1
from	1
Heaven	1
to	1
be	1
revealed	1
In	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
Father,	1
to	1
dissolve	1
Satan	1
with	1
his	1
perverted	1
world;	1
then	1
raise	1
From	1
the	1
conflagrant	1
mass,	1
purged	1
and	1
refined,	1
New	1
Heavens,	1
new	1
Earth,	1
ages	1
of	1
endless	1
date,	1
Founded	1
in	1
righteousness,	1
and	1
peace,	1
and	1
love;	1
To	1
bring	1
forth	1
fruits,	1
joy	1
and	1
eternal	1
bliss.	1
He	1
ended;	1
and	1
thus	1
Adam	1
last	1
replied.	1
How	1
soon	1
hath	1
thy	1
prediction,	1
Seer	1
blest,	1
Measured	1
this	1
transient	1
world,	1
the	1
race	1
of	1
time,	1
Till	1
time	1
stand	1
fixed!	1
Beyond	1
is	1
all	1
abyss,	1
Eternity,	1
whose	1
end	1
no	1
eye	1
can	1
reach.	1
Greatly-instructed	1
I	1
shall	1
hence	1
depart;	1
Greatly	1
in	1
peace	1
of	1
thought;	1
and	1
have	1
my	1
fill	1
Of	1
knowledge,	1
what	1
this	1
vessel	1
can	1
contain;	1
Beyond	1
which	1
was	1
my	1
folly	1
to	1
aspire.	1
Henceforth	1
I	1
learn,	1
that	1
to	1
obey	1
is	1
best,	1
And	1
love	1
with	1
fear	1
the	1
only	1
God;	1
to	1
walk	1
As	1
in	1
his	1
presence;	1
ever	1
to	1
observe	1
His	1
providence;	1
and	1
on	1
him	1
sole	1
depend,	1
Merciful	1
over	1
all	1
his	1
works,	1
with	1
good	1
Still	1
overcoming	1
evil,	1
and	1
by	1
small	1
Accomplishing	1
great	1
things,	1
by	1
things	1
deemed	1
weak	1
Subverting	1
worldly	1
strong,	1
and	1
worldly	1
wise	1
By	1
simply	1
meek:	1
that	1
suffering	1
for	1
truth's	1
sake	1
Is	1
fortitude	1
to	1
highest	1
victory,	1
And,	1
to	1
the	1
faithful,	1
death	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
life;	1
Taught	1
this	1
by	1
his	1
example,	1
whom	1
I	1
now	1
Acknowledge	1
my	1
Redeemer	1
ever	1
blest.	1
To	1
whom	1
thus	1
also	1
the	1
Angel	1
last	1
replied.	1
This	1
having	1
learned,	1
thou	1
hast	1
attained	1
the	1
sum	1
Of	1
wisdom;	1
hope	1
no	1
higher,	1
though	1
all	1
the	1
stars	1
Thou	1
knewest	1
by	1
name,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
ethereal	1
powers,	1
All	1
secrets	1
of	1
the	1
deep,	1
all	1
Nature's	1
works,	1
Or	1
works	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
Heaven,	1
air,	1
earth,	1
or	1
sea,	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
riches	1
of	1
this	1
world	1
enjoyedst,	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
rule,	1
one	1
empire;	1
only	1
add	1
Deeds	1
to	1
thy	1
knowledge	1
answerable;	1
add	1
faith,	1
Add	1
virtue,	1
patience,	1
temperance;	1
add	1
love,	1
By	1
name	1
to	1
come	1
called	1
charity,	1
the	1
soul	1
Of	1
all	1
the	1
rest:	1
then	1
wilt	1
thou	1
not	1
be	1
loth	1
To	1
leave	1
this	1
Paradise,	1
but	1
shalt	1
possess	1
A	1
Paradise	1
within	1
thee,	1
happier	1
far.--	1
Let	1
us	1
descend	1
now	1
therefore	1
from	1
this	1
top	1
Of	1
speculation;	1
for	1
the	1
hour	1
precise	1
Exacts	1
our	1
parting	1
hence;	1
and	1
see!the	1
guards,	1
By	1
me	1
encamped	1
on	1
yonder	1
hill,	1
expect	1
Their	1
motion;	1
at	1
whose	1
front	1
a	1
flaming	1
sword,	1
In	1
signal	1
of	1
remove,	1
waves	1
fiercely	1
round:	1
We	1
may	1
no	1
longer	1
stay:	1
go,	1
waken	1
Eve;	1
Her	1
also	1
I	1
with	1
gentle	1
dreams	1
have	1
calmed	1
Portending	1
good,	1
and	1
all	1
her	1
spirits	1
composed	1
To	1
meek	1
submission:	1
thou,	1
at	1
season	1
fit,	1
Let	1
her	1
with	1
thee	1
partake	1
what	1
thou	1
hast	1
heard;	1
Chiefly	1
what	1
may	1
concern	1
her	1
faith	1
to	1
know,	1
The	1
great	1
deliverance	1
by	1
her	1
seed	1
to	1
come	1
(For	1
by	1
the	1
Woman's	1
seed)	1
on	1
all	1
mankind:	1
That	1
ye	1
may	1
live,	1
which	1
will	1
be	1
many	1
days,	1
Both	1
in	1
one	1
faith	1
unanimous,	1
though	1
sad,	1
With	1
cause,	1
for	1
evils	1
past;	1
yet	1
much	1
more	1
cheered	1
With	1
meditation	1
on	1
the	1
happy	1
end.	1
He	1
ended,	1
and	1
they	1
both	1
descend	1
the	1
hill;	1
Descended,	1
Adam	1
to	1
the	1
bower,	1
where	1
Eve	1
Lay	1
sleeping,	1
ran	1
before;	1
but	1
found	1
her	1
waked;	1
And	1
thus	1
with	1
words	1
not	1
sad	1
she	1
him	1
received.	1
Whence	1
thou	1
returnest,	1
and	1
whither	1
wentest,	1
I	1
know;	1
For	1
God	1
is	1
also	1
in	1
sleep;	1
and	1
dreams	1
advise,	1
Which	1
he	1
hath	1
sent	1
propitious,	1
some	1
great	1
good	1
Presaging,	1
since	1
with	1
sorrow	1
and	1
heart's	1
distress	1
Wearied	1
I	1
fell	1
asleep:	1
But	1
now	1
lead	1
on;	1
In	1
me	1
is	1
no	1
delay;	1
with	1
thee	1
to	1
go,	1
Is	1
to	1
stay	1
here;	1
without	1
thee	1
here	1
to	1
stay,	1
Is	1
to	1
go	1
hence	1
unwilling;	1
thou	1
to	1
me	1
Art	1
all	1
things	1
under	1
$Heaven,	1
all	1
places	1
thou,	1
Who	1
for	1
my	1
wilful	1
crime	1
art	1
banished	1
hence.	1
This	1
further	1
consolation	1
yet	1
secure	1
I	1
carry	1
hence;	1
though	1
all	1
by	1
me	1
is	1
lost,	1
Such	1
favour	1
I	1
unworthy	1
am	1
vouchsafed,	1
By	1
me	1
the	1
Promised	1
Seed	1
shall	1
all	1
restore.	1
So	1
spake	1
our	1
mother	1
Eve;	1
and	1
Adam	1
heard	1
Well	1
pleased,	1
but	1
answered	1
not:	1
For	1
now,	1
too	1
nigh	1
The	1
Arch-Angel	1
stood;	1
and,	1
from	1
the	1
other	1
hill	1
To	1
their	1
fixed	1
station,	1
all	1
in	1
bright	1
array	1
The	1
Cherubim	1
descended;	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
Gliding	1
meteorous,	1
as	1
evening-mist	1
Risen	1
from	1
a	1
river	1
o'er	1
the	1
marish	1
glides,	1
And	1
gathers	1
ground	1
fast	1
at	1
the	1
labourer's	1
heel	1
Homeward	1
returning.	1
High	1
in	1
front	1
advanced,	1
The	1
brandished	1
sword	1
of	1
God	1
before	1
them	1
blazed,	1
Fierce	1
as	1
a	1
comet;	1
which	1
with	1
torrid	1
heat,	1
And	1
vapour	1
as	1
the	1
Libyan	1
air	1
adust,	1
Began	1
to	1
parch	1
that	1
temperate	1
clime;	1
whereat	1
In	1
either	1
hand	1
the	1
hastening	1
Angel	1
caught	1
Our	1
lingering	1
parents,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
eastern	1
gate	1
Led	1
them	1
direct,	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
cliff	1
as	1
fast	1
To	1
the	1
subjected	1
plain;	1
then	1
disappeared.	1
They,	1
looking	1
back,	1
all	1
the	1
eastern	1
side	1
beheld	1
Of	1
Paradise,	1
so	1
late	1
their	1
happy	1
seat,	1
Waved	1
over	1
by	1
that	1
flaming	1
brand;	1
the	1
gate	1
With	1
dreadful	1
faces	1
thronged,	1
and	1
fiery	1
arms:	1
Some	1
natural	1
tears	1
they	1
dropt,	1
but	1
wiped	1
them	1
soon;	1
The	1
world	1
was	1
all	1
before	1
them,	1
where	1
to	1
choose	1
Their	1
place	1
of	1
rest,	1
and	1
Providence	1
their	1
guide:	1
They,	1
hand	1
in	1
hand,	1
with	1
wandering	1
steps	1
and	1
slow,	1
Through	1
Eden	1
took	1
their	1
solitary	1
way.	1
