1	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
Elliot,	1
of	1
Kellynch	1
Hall,	1
in	1
Somersetshire,	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
who,	1
for	1
his	1
own	1
amusement,	1
never	1
took	1
up	1
any	1
book	1
but	1
the	1
Baronetage;	1
there	1
he	1
found	1
occupation	1
for	1
an	1
idle	1
hour,	1
and	1
consolation	1
in	1
a	1
distressed	1
one;	1
there	1
his	1
faculties	1
were	1
roused	1
into	1
admiration	1
and	1
respect,	1
by	1
contemplating	1
the	1
limited	1
remnant	1
of	1
the	1
earliest	1
patents;	1
there	1
any	1
unwelcome	1
sensations,	1
arising	1
from	1
domestic	1
affairs	1
changed	1
naturally	1
into	1
pity	1
and	1
contempt	1
as	1
he	1
turned	1
over	1
the	1
almost	1
endless	1
creations	1
of	1
the	1
last	1
century;	1
and	1
there,	1
if	1
every	1
other	1
leaf	1
were	1
powerless,	1
he	1
could	1
read	1
his	1
own	1
history	1
with	1
an	1
interest	1
which	1
never	1
failed.	1
This	1
was	1
the	1
page	1
at	1
which	1
the	1
favourite	1
volume	1
always	1
opened:	1
"ELLIOT	1
OF	1
KELLYNCH	1
HALL.	1
"Walter	1
Elliot,	1
born	1
March	1
1,	1
1760,	1
married,	1
July	1
15,	1
1784,	1
Elizabeth,	1
daughter	1
of	1
James	1
Stevenson,	1
Esq.	1
of	1
South	1
Park,	1
in	1
the	1
county	1
of	1
Gloucester,	1
by	1
which	1
lady	1
(who	1
died	1
1800)	1
he	1
has	1
issue	1
Elizabeth,	1
born	1
June	1
1,	1
1785;	1
Anne,	1
born	1
August	1
9,	1
1787;	1
a	1
still-born	1
son,	1
November	1
5,	1
1789;	1
Mary,	1
born	1
November	1
20,	1
1791."	1
Precisely	1
such	1
had	1
the	1
paragraph	1
originally	1
stood	1
from	1
the	1
printer's	1
hands;	1
but	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
had	1
improved	1
it	1
by	1
adding,	1
for	1
the	1
information	1
of	1
himself	1
and	1
his	1
family,	1
these	1
words,	1
after	1
the	1
date	1
of	1
Mary's	1
birth--	1
"Married,	1
December	1
16,	1
1810,	1
Charles,	1
son	1
and	1
heir	1
of	1
Charles	1
Musgrove,	1
Esq.	1
of	1
Uppercross,	1
in	1
the	1
county	1
of	1
Somerset,"	1
and	1
by	1
inserting	1
most	1
accurately	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
month	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
lost	1
his	1
wife.	1
Then	1
followed	1
the	1
history	1
and	1
rise	1
of	1
the	1
ancient	1
and	1
respectable	1
family,	1
in	1
the	1
usual	1
terms;	1
how	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
first	1
settled	1
in	1
Cheshire;	1
how	1
mentioned	1
in	1
Dugdale,	1
serving	1
the	1
office	1
of	1
high	1
sheriff,	1
representing	1
a	1
borough	1
in	1
three	1
successive	1
parliaments,	1
exertions	1
of	1
loyalty,	1
and	1
dignity	1
of	1
baronet,	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
year	1
of	1
Charles	1
II,	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
Marys	1
and	1
Elizabeths	1
they	1
had	1
married;	1
forming	1
altogether	1
two	1
handsome	1
duodecimo	1
pages,	1
and	1
concluding	1
with	1
the	1
arms	1
and	1
motto:--"Principal	1
seat,	1
Kellynch	1
Hall,	1
in	1
the	1
county	1
of	1
Somerset,"	1
and	1
Sir	1
Walter's	1
handwriting	1
again	1
in	1
this	1
finale:--	1
"Heir	1
presumptive,	1
William	1
Walter	1
Elliot,	1
Esq.,	1
great	1
grandson	1
of	1
the	1
second	1
Sir	1
Walter."	1
Vanity	1
was	1
the	1
beginning	1
and	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
Elliot's	1
character;	1
vanity	1
of	1
person	1
and	1
of	1
situation.	1
He	1
had	1
been	1
remarkably	1
handsome	1
in	1
his	1
youth;	1
and,	1
at	1
fifty-four,	1
was	1
still	1
a	1
very	1
fine	1
man.	1
Few	1
women	1
could	1
think	1
more	1
of	1
their	1
personal	1
appearance	1
than	1
he	1
did,	1
nor	1
could	1
the	1
valet	1
of	1
any	1
new	1
made	1
lord	1
be	1
more	1
delighted	1
with	1
the	1
place	1
he	1
held	1
in	1
society.	1
He	1
considered	1
the	1
blessing	1
of	1
beauty	1
as	1
inferior	1
only	1
to	1
the	1
blessing	1
of	1
a	1
baronetcy;	1
and	1
the	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
Elliot,	1
who	1
united	1
these	1
gifts,	1
was	1
the	1
constant	1
object	1
of	1
his	1
warmest	1
respect	1
and	1
devotion.	1
His	1
good	1
looks	1
and	1
his	1
rank	1
had	1
one	1
fair	1
claim	1
on	1
his	1
attachment;	1
since	1
to	1
them	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
owed	1
a	1
wife	1
of	1
very	1
superior	1
character	1
to	1
any	1
thing	1
deserved	1
by	1
his	1
own.	1
Lady	1
Elliot	1
had	1
been	1
an	1
excellent	1
woman,	1
sensible	1
and	1
amiable;	1
whose	1
judgement	1
and	1
conduct,	1
if	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
pardoned	1
the	1
youthful	1
infatuation	1
which	1
made	1
her	1
Lady	1
Elliot,	1
had	1
never	1
required	1
indulgence	1
afterwards.--She	1
had	1
humoured,	1
or	1
softened,	1
or	1
concealed	1
his	1
failings,	1
and	1
promoted	1
his	1
real	1
respectability	1
for	1
seventeen	1
years;	1
and	1
though	1
not	1
the	1
very	1
happiest	1
being	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
herself,	1
had	1
found	1
enough	1
in	1
her	1
duties,	1
her	1
friends,	1
and	1
her	1
children,	1
to	1
attach	1
her	1
to	1
life,	1
and	1
make	1
it	1
no	1
matter	1
of	1
indifference	1
to	1
her	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
called	1
on	1
to	1
quit	1
them.	1
--Three	1
girls,	1
the	1
two	1
eldest	1
sixteen	1
and	1
fourteen,	1
was	1
an	1
awful	1
legacy	1
for	1
a	1
mother	1
to	1
bequeath,	1
an	1
awful	1
charge	1
rather,	1
to	1
confide	1
to	1
the	1
authority	1
and	1
guidance	1
of	1
a	1
conceited,	1
silly	1
father.	1
She	1
had,	1
however,	1
one	1
very	1
intimate	1
friend,	1
a	1
sensible,	1
deserving	1
woman,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
brought,	1
by	1
strong	1
attachment	1
to	1
herself,	1
to	1
settle	1
close	1
by	1
her,	1
in	1
the	1
village	1
of	1
Kellynch;	1
and	1
on	1
her	1
kindness	1
and	1
advice,	1
Lady	1
Elliot	1
mainly	1
relied	1
for	1
the	1
best	1
help	1
and	1
maintenance	1
of	1
the	1
good	1
principles	1
and	1
instruction	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
anxiously	1
giving	1
her	1
daughters.	1
This	1
friend,	1
and	1
Sir	1
Walter,	1
did	1
not	1
marry,	1
whatever	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
anticipated	1
on	1
that	1
head	1
by	1
their	1
acquaintance.	1
Thirteen	1
years	1
had	1
passed	1
away	1
since	1
Lady	1
Elliot's	1
death,	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
still	1
near	1
neighbours	1
and	1
intimate	1
friends,	1
and	1
one	1
remained	1
a	1
widower,	1
the	1
other	1
a	1
widow.	1
That	1
Lady	1
Russell,	1
of	1
steady	1
age	1
and	1
character,	1
and	1
extremely	1
well	1
provided	1
for,	1
should	1
have	1
no	1
thought	1
of	1
a	1
second	1
marriage,	1
needs	1
no	1
apology	1
to	1
the	1
public,	1
which	1
is	1
rather	1
apt	1
to	1
be	1
unreasonably	1
discontented	1
when	1
a	1
woman	1
does	1
marry	1
again,	1
than	1
when	1
she	1
does	1
not;	1
but	1
Sir	1
Walter's	1
continuing	1
in	1
singleness	1
requires	1
explanation.	1
Be	1
it	1
known	1
then,	1
that	1
Sir	1
Walter,	1
like	1
a	1
good	1
father,	1
(having	1
met	1
with	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
private	1
disappointments	1
in	1
very	1
unreasonable	1
applications),	1
prided	1
himself	1
on	1
remaining	1
single	1
for	1
his	1
dear	1
daughters'	1
sake.	1
For	1
one	1
daughter,	1
his	1
eldest,	1
he	1
would	1
really	1
have	1
given	1
up	1
any	1
thing,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
very	1
much	1
tempted	1
to	1
do.	1
Elizabeth	1
had	1
succeeded,	1
at	1
sixteen,	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
possible,	1
of	1
her	1
mother's	1
rights	1
and	1
consequence;	1
and	1
being	1
very	1
handsome,	1
and	1
very	1
like	1
himself,	1
her	1
influence	1
had	1
always	1
been	1
great,	1
and	1
they	1
had	1
gone	1
on	1
together	1
most	1
happily.	1
His	1
two	1
other	1
children	1
were	1
of	1
very	1
inferior	1
value.	1
Mary	1
had	1
acquired	1
a	1
little	1
artificial	1
importance,	1
by	1
becoming	1
Mrs	1
Charles	1
Musgrove;	1
but	1
Anne,	1
with	1
an	1
elegance	1
of	1
mind	1
and	1
sweetness	1
of	1
character,	1
which	1
must	1
have	1
placed	1
her	1
high	1
with	1
any	1
people	1
of	1
real	1
understanding,	1
was	1
nobody	1
with	1
either	1
father	1
or	1
sister;	1
her	1
word	1
had	1
no	1
weight,	1
her	1
convenience	1
was	1
always	1
to	1
give	1
way--	1
she	1
was	1
only	1
Anne.	1
To	1
Lady	1
Russell,	1
indeed,	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
most	1
dear	1
and	1
highly	1
valued	1
god-daughter,	1
favourite,	1
and	1
friend.	1
Lady	1
Russell	1
loved	1
them	1
all;	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
in	1
Anne	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
fancy	1
the	1
mother	1
to	1
revive	1
again.	1
A	1
few	1
years	1
before,	1
Anne	1
Elliot	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
very	1
pretty	1
girl,	1
but	1
her	1
bloom	1
had	1
vanished	1
early;	1
and	1
as	1
even	1
in	1
its	1
height,	1
her	1
father	1
had	1
found	1
little	1
to	1
admire	1
in	1
her,	1
(so	1
totally	1
different	1
were	1
her	1
delicate	1
features	1
and	1
mild	1
dark	1
eyes	1
from	1
his	1
own),	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
nothing	1
in	1
them,	1
now	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
faded	1
and	1
thin,	1
to	1
excite	1
his	1
esteem.	1
He	1
had	1
never	1
indulged	1
much	1
hope,	1
he	1
had	1
now	1
none,	1
of	1
ever	1
reading	1
her	1
name	1
in	1
any	1
other	1
page	1
of	1
his	1
favourite	1
work.	1
All	1
equality	1
of	1
alliance	1
must	1
rest	1
with	1
Elizabeth,	1
for	1
Mary	1
had	1
merely	1
connected	1
herself	1
with	1
an	1
old	1
country	1
family	1
of	1
respectability	1
and	1
large	1
fortune,	1
and	1
had	1
therefore	1
given	1
all	1
the	1
honour	1
and	1
received	1
none:	1
Elizabeth	1
would,	1
one	1
day	1
or	1
other,	1
marry	1
suitably.	1
It	1
sometimes	1
happens	1
that	1
a	1
woman	1
is	1
handsomer	1
at	1
twenty-nine	1
than	1
she	1
was	1
ten	1
years	1
before;	1
and,	1
generally	1
speaking,	1
if	1
there	1
has	1
been	1
neither	1
ill	1
health	1
nor	1
anxiety,	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
time	1
of	1
life	1
at	1
which	1
scarcely	1
any	1
charm	1
is	1
lost.	1
It	1
was	1
so	1
with	1
Elizabeth,	1
still	1
the	1
same	1
handsome	1
Miss	1
Elliot	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
begun	1
to	1
be	1
thirteen	1
years	1
ago,	1
and	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
might	1
be	1
excused,	1
therefore,	1
in	1
forgetting	1
her	1
age,	1
or,	1
at	1
least,	1
be	1
deemed	1
only	1
half	1
a	1
fool,	1
for	1
thinking	1
himself	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
as	1
blooming	1
as	1
ever,	1
amidst	1
the	1
wreck	1
of	1
the	1
good	1
looks	1
of	1
everybody	1
else;	1
for	1
he	1
could	1
plainly	1
see	1
how	1
old	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
his	1
family	1
and	1
acquaintance	1
were	1
growing.	1
Anne	1
haggard,	1
Mary	1
coarse,	1
every	1
face	1
in	1
the	1
neighbourhood	1
worsting,	1
and	1
the	1
rapid	1
increase	1
of	1
the	1
crow's	1
foot	1
about	1
Lady	1
Russell's	1
temples	1
had	1
long	1
been	1
a	1
distress	1
to	1
him.	1
Elizabeth	1
did	1
not	1
quite	1
equal	1
her	1
father	1
in	1
personal	1
contentment.	1
Thirteen	1
years	1
had	1
seen	1
her	1
mistress	1
of	1
Kellynch	1
Hall,	1
presiding	1
and	1
directing	1
with	1
a	1
self-possession	1
and	1
decision	1
which	1
could	1
never	1
have	1
given	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
her	1
being	1
younger	1
than	1
she	1
was.	1
For	1
thirteen	1
years	1
had	1
she	1
been	1
doing	1
the	1
honours,	1
and	1
laying	1
down	1
the	1
domestic	1
law	1
at	1
home,	1
and	1
leading	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
chaise	1
and	1
four,	1
and	1
walking	1
immediately	1
after	1
Lady	1
Russell	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
drawing-rooms	1
and	1
dining-rooms	1
in	1
the	1
country.	1
Thirteen	1
winters'	1
revolving	1
frosts	1
had	1
seen	1
her	1
opening	1
every	1
ball	1
of	1
credit	1
which	1
a	1
scanty	1
neighbourhood	1
afforded,	1
and	1
thirteen	1
springs	1
shewn	1
their	1
blossoms,	1
as	1
she	1
travelled	1
up	1
to	1
London	1
with	1
her	1
father,	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
weeks'	1
annual	1
enjoyment	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
world.	1
She	1
had	1
the	1
remembrance	1
of	1
all	1
this,	1
she	1
had	1
the	1
consciousness	1
of	1
being	1
nine-and-twenty	1
to	1
give	1
her	1
some	1
regrets	1
and	1
some	1
apprehensions;	1
she	1
was	1
fully	1
satisfied	1
of	1
being	1
still	1
quite	1
as	1
handsome	1
as	1
ever,	1
but	1
she	1
felt	1
her	1
approach	1
to	1
the	1
years	1
of	1
danger,	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
rejoiced	1
to	1
be	1
certain	1
of	1
being	1
properly	1
solicited	1
by	1
baronet-blood	1
within	1
the	1
next	1
twelvemonth	1
or	1
two.	1
Then	1
might	1
she	1
again	1
take	1
up	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
books	1
with	1
as	1
much	1
enjoyment	1
as	1
in	1
her	1
early	1
youth,	1
but	1
now	1
she	1
liked	1
it	1
not.	1
Always	1
to	1
be	1
presented	1
with	1
the	1
date	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
birth	1
and	1
see	1
no	1
marriage	1
follow	1
but	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
youngest	1
sister,	1
made	1
the	1
book	1
an	1
evil;	1
and	1
more	1
than	1
once,	1
when	1
her	1
father	1
had	1
left	1
it	1
open	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
near	1
her,	1
had	1
she	1
closed	1
it,	1
with	1
averted	1
eyes,	1
and	1
pushed	1
it	1
away.	1
She	1
had	1
had	1
a	1
disappointment,	1
moreover,	1
which	1
that	1
book,	1
and	1
especially	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
family,	1
must	1
ever	1
present	1
the	1
remembrance	1
of.	1
The	1
heir	1
presumptive,	1
the	1
very	1
William	1
Walter	1
Elliot,	1
Esq.,	1
whose	1
rights	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
generously	1
supported	1
by	1
her	1
father,	1
had	1
disappointed	1
her.	1
She	1
had,	1
while	1
a	1
very	1
young	1
girl,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
known	1
him	1
to	1
be,	1
in	1
the	1
event	1
of	1
her	1
having	1
no	1
brother,	1
the	1
future	1
baronet,	1
meant	1
to	1
marry	1
him,	1
and	1
her	1
father	1
had	1
always	1
meant	1
that	1
she	1
should.	1
He	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
known	1
to	1
them	1
as	1
a	1
boy;	1
but	1
soon	1
after	1
Lady	1
Elliot's	1
death,	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
had	1
sought	1
the	1
acquaintance,	1
and	1
though	1
his	1
overtures	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
met	1
with	1
any	1
warmth,	1
he	1
had	1
persevered	1
in	1
seeking	1
it,	1
making	1
allowance	1
for	1
the	1
modest	1
drawing-back	1
of	1
youth;	1
and,	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
their	1
spring	1
excursions	1
to	1
London,	1
when	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
in	1
her	1
first	1
bloom,	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
had	1
been	1
forced	1
into	1
the	1
introduction.	1
He	1
was	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
a	1
very	1
young	1
man,	1
just	1
engaged	1
in	1
the	1
study	1
of	1
the	1
law;	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
found	1
him	1
extremely	1
agreeable,	1
and	1
every	1
plan	1
in	1
his	1
favour	1
was	1
confirmed.	1
He	1
was	1
invited	1
to	1
Kellynch	1
Hall;	1
he	1
was	1
talked	1
of	1
and	1
expected	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
year;	1
but	1
he	1
never	1
came.	1
The	1
following	1
spring	1
he	1
was	1
seen	1
again	1
in	1
town,	1
found	1
equally	1
agreeable,	1
again	1
encouraged,	1
invited,	1
and	1
expected,	1
and	1
again	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
come;	1
and	1
the	1
next	1
tidings	1
were	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
married.	1
Instead	1
of	1
pushing	1
his	1
fortune	1
in	1
the	1
line	1
marked	1
out	1
for	1
the	1
heir	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Elliot,	1
he	1
had	1
purchased	1
independence	1
by	1
uniting	1
himself	1
to	1
a	1
rich	1
woman	1
of	1
inferior	1
birth.	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
has	1
resented	1
it.	1
As	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
consulted,	1
especially	1
after	1
taking	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
so	1
publicly	1
by	1
the	1
hand;	1
"For	1
they	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
seen	1
together,"	1
he	1
observed,	1
"once	1
at	1
Tattersall's,	1
and	1
twice	1
in	1
the	1
lobby	1
of	1
the	1
House	1
of	1
Commons."	1
His	1
disapprobation	1
was	1
expressed,	1
but	1
apparently	1
very	1
little	1
regarded.	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
had	1
attempted	1
no	1
apology,	1
and	1
shewn	1
himself	1
as	1
unsolicitous	1
of	1
being	1
longer	1
noticed	1
by	1
the	1
family,	1
as	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
considered	1
him	1
unworthy	1
of	1
it:	1
all	1
acquaintance	1
between	1
them	1
had	1
ceased.	1
This	1
very	1
awkward	1
history	1
of	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
was	1
still,	1
after	1
an	1
interval	1
of	1
several	1
years,	1
felt	1
with	1
anger	1
by	1
Elizabeth,	1
who	1
had	1
liked	1
the	1
man	1
for	1
himself,	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
for	1
being	1
her	1
father's	1
heir,	1
and	1
whose	1
strong	1
family	1
pride	1
could	1
see	1
only	1
in	1
him	1
a	1
proper	1
match	1
for	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
Elliot's	1
eldest	1
daughter.	1
There	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
baronet	1
from	1
A	1
to	1
Z	1
whom	1
her	1
feelings	1
could	1
have	1
so	1
willingly	1
acknowledged	1
as	1
an	1
equal.	1
Yet	1
so	1
miserably	1
had	1
he	1
conducted	1
himself,	1
that	1
though	1
she	1
was	1
at	1
this	1
present	1
time	1
(the	1
summer	1
of	1
1814)	1
wearing	1
black	1
ribbons	1
for	1
his	1
wife,	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
admit	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
worth	1
thinking	1
of	1
again.	1
The	1
disgrace	1
of	1
his	1
first	1
marriage	1
might,	1
perhaps,	1
as	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
reason	1
to	1
suppose	1
it	1
perpetuated	1
by	1
offspring,	1
have	1
been	1
got	1
over,	1
had	1
he	1
not	1
done	1
worse;	1
but	1
he	1
had,	1
as	1
by	1
the	1
accustomary	1
intervention	1
of	1
kind	1
friends,	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
informed,	1
spoken	1
most	1
disrespectfully	1
of	1
them	1
all,	1
most	1
slightingly	1
and	1
contemptuously	1
of	1
the	1
very	1
blood	1
he	1
belonged	1
to,	1
and	1
the	1
honours	1
which	1
were	1
hereafter	1
to	1
be	1
his	1
own.	1
This	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
pardoned.	1
Such	1
were	1
Elizabeth	1
Elliot's	1
sentiments	1
and	1
sensations;	1
such	1
the	1
cares	1
to	1
alloy,	1
the	1
agitations	1
to	1
vary,	1
the	1
sameness	1
and	1
the	1
elegance,	1
the	1
prosperity	1
and	1
the	1
nothingness	1
of	1
her	1
scene	1
of	1
life;	1
such	1
the	1
feelings	1
to	1
give	1
interest	1
to	1
a	1
long,	1
uneventful	1
residence	1
in	1
one	1
country	1
circle,	1
to	1
fill	1
the	1
vacancies	1
which	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
habits	1
of	1
utility	1
abroad,	1
no	1
talents	1
or	1
accomplishments	1
for	1
home,	1
to	1
occupy.	1
But	1
now,	1
another	1
occupation	1
and	1
solicitude	1
of	1
mind	1
was	1
beginning	1
to	1
be	1
added	1
to	1
these.	1
Her	1
father	1
was	1
growing	1
distressed	1
for	1
money.	1
She	1
knew,	1
that	1
when	1
he	1
now	1
took	1
up	1
the	1
Baronetage,	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
drive	1
the	1
heavy	1
bills	1
of	1
his	1
tradespeople,	1
and	1
the	1
unwelcome	1
hints	1
of	1
Mr	1
Shepherd,	1
his	1
agent,	1
from	1
his	1
thoughts.	1
The	1
Kellynch	1
property	1
was	1
good,	1
but	1
not	1
equal	1
to	1
Sir	1
Walter's	1
apprehension	1
of	1
the	1
state	1
required	1
in	1
its	1
possessor.	1
While	1
Lady	1
Elliot	1
lived,	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
method,	1
moderation,	1
and	1
economy,	1
which	1
had	1
just	1
kept	1
him	1
within	1
his	1
income;	1
but	1
with	1
her	1
had	1
died	1
all	1
such	1
right-mindedness,	1
and	1
from	1
that	1
period	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
constantly	1
exceeding	1
it.	1
It	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
possible	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
spend	1
less;	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
nothing	1
but	1
what	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
Elliot	1
was	1
imperiously	1
called	1
on	1
to	1
do;	1
but	1
blameless	1
as	1
he	1
was,	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
only	1
growing	1
dreadfully	1
in	1
debt,	1
but	1
was	1
hearing	1
of	1
it	1
so	1
often,	1
that	1
it	1
became	1
vain	1
to	1
attempt	1
concealing	1
it	1
longer,	1
even	1
partially,	1
from	1
his	1
daughter.	1
He	1
had	1
given	1
her	1
some	1
hints	1
of	1
it	1
the	1
last	1
spring	1
in	1
town;	1
he	1
had	1
gone	1
so	1
far	1
even	1
as	1
to	1
say,	1
"Can	1
we	1
retrench?	1
Does	1
it	1
occur	1
to	1
you	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
any	1
one	1
article	1
in	1
which	1
we	1
can	1
retrench?"	1
and	1
Elizabeth,	1
to	1
do	1
her	1
justice,	1
had,	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
ardour	1
of	1
female	1
alarm,	1
set	1
seriously	1
to	1
think	1
what	1
could	1
be	1
done,	1
and	1
had	1
finally	1
proposed	1
these	1
two	1
branches	1
of	1
economy,	1
to	1
cut	1
off	1
some	1
unnecessary	1
charities,	1
and	1
to	1
refrain	1
from	1
new	1
furnishing	1
the	1
drawing-room;	1
to	1
which	1
expedients	1
she	1
afterwards	1
added	1
the	1
happy	1
thought	1
of	1
their	1
taking	1
no	1
present	1
down	1
to	1
Anne,	1
as	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
usual	1
yearly	1
custom.	1
But	1
these	1
measures,	1
however	1
good	1
in	1
themselves,	1
were	1
insufficient	1
for	1
the	1
real	1
extent	1
of	1
the	1
evil,	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
which	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
found	1
himself	1
obliged	1
to	1
confess	1
to	1
her	1
soon	1
afterwards.	1
Elizabeth	1
had	1
nothing	1
to	1
propose	1
of	1
deeper	1
efficacy.	1
She	1
felt	1
herself	1
ill-used	1
and	1
unfortunate,	1
as	1
did	1
her	1
father;	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
neither	1
of	1
them	1
able	1
to	1
devise	1
any	1
means	1
of	1
lessening	1
their	1
expenses	1
without	1
compromising	1
their	1
dignity,	1
or	1
relinquishing	1
their	1
comforts	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
borne.	1
There	1
was	1
only	1
a	1
small	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
estate	1
that	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
could	1
dispose	1
of;	1
but	1
had	1
every	1
acre	1
been	1
alienable,	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
made	1
no	1
difference.	1
He	1
had	1
condescended	1
to	1
mortgage	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
power,	1
but	1
he	1
would	1
never	1
condescend	1
to	1
sell.	1
No;	1
he	1
would	1
never	1
disgrace	1
his	1
name	1
so	1
far.	1
The	1
Kellynch	1
estate	1
should	1
be	1
transmitted	1
whole	1
and	1
entire,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
received	1
it.	1
Their	1
two	1
confidential	1
friends,	1
Mr	1
Shepherd,	1
who	1
lived	1
in	1
the	1
neighbouring	1
market	1
town,	1
and	1
Lady	1
Russell,	1
were	1
called	1
to	1
advise	1
them;	1
and	1
both	1
father	1
and	1
daughter	1
seemed	1
to	1
expect	1
that	1
something	1
should	1
be	1
struck	1
out	1
by	1
one	1
or	1
the	1
other	1
to	1
remove	1
their	1
embarrassments	1
and	1
reduce	1
their	1
expenditure,	1
without	1
involving	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
any	1
indulgence	1
of	1
taste	1
or	1
pride.	1
Chapter	1
2	1
Mr	1
Shepherd,	1
a	1
civil,	1
cautious	1
lawyer,	1
who,	1
whatever	1
might	1
be	1
his	1
hold	1
or	1
his	1
views	1
on	1
Sir	1
Walter,	1
would	1
rather	1
have	1
the	1
disagreeable	1
prompted	1
by	1
anybody	1
else,	1
excused	1
himself	1
from	1
offering	1
the	1
slightest	1
hint,	1
and	1
only	1
begged	1
leave	1
to	1
recommend	1
an	1
implicit	1
reference	1
to	1
the	1
excellent	1
judgement	1
of	1
Lady	1
Russell,	1
from	1
whose	1
known	1
good	1
sense	1
he	1
fully	1
expected	1
to	1
have	1
just	1
such	1
resolute	1
measures	1
advised	1
as	1
he	1
meant	1
to	1
see	1
finally	1
adopted.	1
Lady	1
Russell	1
was	1
most	1
anxiously	1
zealous	1
on	1
the	1
subject,	1
and	1
gave	1
it	1
much	1
serious	1
consideration.	1
She	1
was	1
a	1
woman	1
rather	1
of	1
sound	1
than	1
of	1
quick	1
abilities,	1
whose	1
difficulties	1
in	1
coming	1
to	1
any	1
decision	1
in	1
this	1
instance	1
were	1
great,	1
from	1
the	1
opposition	1
of	1
two	1
leading	1
principles.	1
She	1
was	1
of	1
strict	1
integrity	1
herself,	1
with	1
a	1
delicate	1
sense	1
of	1
honour;	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
as	1
desirous	1
of	1
saving	1
Sir	1
Walter's	1
feelings,	1
as	1
solicitous	1
for	1
the	1
credit	1
of	1
the	1
family,	1
as	1
aristocratic	1
in	1
her	1
ideas	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
due	1
to	1
them,	1
as	1
anybody	1
of	1
sense	1
and	1
honesty	1
could	1
well	1
be.	1
She	1
was	1
a	1
benevolent,	1
charitable,	1
good	1
woman,	1
and	1
capable	1
of	1
strong	1
attachments,	1
most	1
correct	1
in	1
her	1
conduct,	1
strict	1
in	1
her	1
notions	1
of	1
decorum,	1
and	1
with	1
manners	1
that	1
were	1
held	1
a	1
standard	1
of	1
good-breeding.	1
She	1
had	1
a	1
cultivated	1
mind,	1
and	1
was,	1
generally	1
speaking,	1
rational	1
and	1
consistent;	1
but	1
she	1
had	1
prejudices	1
on	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
ancestry;	1
she	1
had	1
a	1
value	1
for	1
rank	1
and	1
consequence,	1
which	1
blinded	1
her	1
a	1
little	1
to	1
the	1
faults	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
possessed	1
them.	1
Herself	1
the	1
widow	1
of	1
only	1
a	1
knight,	1
she	1
gave	1
the	1
dignity	1
of	1
a	1
baronet	1
all	1
its	1
due;	1
and	1
Sir	1
Walter,	1
independent	1
of	1
his	1
claims	1
as	1
an	1
old	1
acquaintance,	1
an	1
attentive	1
neighbour,	1
an	1
obliging	1
landlord,	1
the	1
husband	1
of	1
her	1
very	1
dear	1
friend,	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
Anne	1
and	1
her	1
sisters,	1
was,	1
as	1
being	1
Sir	1
Walter,	1
in	1
her	1
apprehension,	1
entitled	1
to	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
compassion	1
and	1
consideration	1
under	1
his	1
present	1
difficulties.	1
They	1
must	1
retrench;	1
that	1
did	1
not	1
admit	1
of	1
a	1
doubt.	1
But	1
she	1
was	1
very	1
anxious	1
to	1
have	1
it	1
done	1
with	1
the	1
least	1
possible	1
pain	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
Elizabeth.	1
She	1
drew	1
up	1
plans	1
of	1
economy,	1
she	1
made	1
exact	1
calculations,	1
and	1
she	1
did	1
what	1
nobody	1
else	1
thought	1
of	1
doing:	1
she	1
consulted	1
Anne,	1
who	1
never	1
seemed	1
considered	1
by	1
the	1
others	1
as	1
having	1
any	1
interest	1
in	1
the	1
question.	1
She	1
consulted,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
degree	1
was	1
influenced	1
by	1
her	1
in	1
marking	1
out	1
the	1
scheme	1
of	1
retrenchment	1
which	1
was	1
at	1
last	1
submitted	1
to	1
Sir	1
Walter.	1
Every	1
emendation	1
of	1
Anne's	1
had	1
been	1
on	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
honesty	1
against	1
importance.	1
She	1
wanted	1
more	1
vigorous	1
measures,	1
a	1
more	1
complete	1
reformation,	1
a	1
quicker	1
release	1
from	1
debt,	1
a	1
much	1
higher	1
tone	1
of	1
indifference	1
for	1
everything	1
but	1
justice	1
and	1
equity.	1
"If	1
we	1
can	1
persuade	1
your	1
father	1
to	1
all	1
this,"	1
said	1
Lady	1
Russell,	1
looking	1
over	1
her	1
paper,	1
"much	1
may	1
be	1
done.	1
If	1
he	1
will	1
adopt	1
these	1
regulations,	1
in	1
seven	1
years	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
clear;	1
and	1
I	1
hope	1
we	1
may	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
convince	1
him	1
and	1
Elizabeth,	1
that	1
Kellynch	1
Hall	1
has	1
a	1
respectability	1
in	1
itself	1
which	1
cannot	1
be	1
affected	1
by	1
these	1
reductions;	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
true	1
dignity	1
of	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
Elliot	1
will	1
be	1
very	1
far	1
from	1
lessened	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
sensible	1
people,	1
by	1
acting	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
principle.	1
What	1
will	1
he	1
be	1
doing,	1
in	1
fact,	1
but	1
what	1
very	1
many	1
of	1
our	1
first	1
families	1
have	1
done,	1
or	1
ought	1
to	1
do?	1
There	1
will	1
be	1
nothing	1
singular	1
in	1
his	1
case;	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
singularity	1
which	1
often	1
makes	1
the	1
worst	1
part	1
of	1
our	1
suffering,	1
as	1
it	1
always	1
does	1
of	1
our	1
conduct.	1
I	1
have	1
great	1
hope	1
of	1
prevailing.	1
We	1
must	1
be	1
serious	1
and	1
decided;	1
for	1
after	1
all,	1
the	1
person	1
who	1
has	1
contracted	1
debts	1
must	1
pay	1
them;	1
and	1
though	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
is	1
due	1
to	1
the	1
feelings	1
of	1
the	1
gentleman,	1
and	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
a	1
house,	1
like	1
your	1
father,	1
there	1
is	1
still	1
more	1
due	1
to	1
the	1
character	1
of	1
an	1
honest	1
man."	1
This	1
was	1
the	1
principle	1
on	1
which	1
Anne	1
wanted	1
her	1
father	1
to	1
be	1
proceeding,	1
his	1
friends	1
to	1
be	1
urging	1
him.	1
She	1
considered	1
it	1
as	1
an	1
act	1
of	1
indispensable	1
duty	1
to	1
clear	1
away	1
the	1
claims	1
of	1
creditors	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
expedition	1
which	1
the	1
most	1
comprehensive	1
retrenchments	1
could	1
secure,	1
and	1
saw	1
no	1
dignity	1
in	1
anything	1
short	1
of	1
it.	1
She	1
wanted	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
prescribed,	1
and	1
felt	1
as	1
a	1
duty.	1
She	1
rated	1
Lady	1
Russell's	1
influence	1
highly;	1
and	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
severe	1
degree	1
of	1
self-denial	1
which	1
her	1
own	1
conscience	1
prompted,	1
she	1
believed	1
there	1
might	1
be	1
little	1
more	1
difficulty	1
in	1
persuading	1
them	1
to	1
a	1
complete,	1
than	1
to	1
half	1
a	1
reformation.	1
Her	1
knowledge	1
of	1
her	1
father	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
inclined	1
her	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
the	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
one	1
pair	1
of	1
horses	1
would	1
be	1
hardly	1
less	1
painful	1
than	1
of	1
both,	1
and	1
so	1
on,	1
through	1
the	1
whole	1
list	1
of	1
Lady	1
Russell's	1
too	1
gentle	1
reductions.	1
How	1
Anne's	1
more	1
rigid	1
requisitions	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
taken	1
is	1
of	1
little	1
consequence.	1
Lady	1
Russell's	1
had	1
no	1
success	1
at	1
all:	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
put	1
up	1
with,	1
were	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
borne.	1
"What!	1
every	1
comfort	1
of	1
life	1
knocked	1
off!	1
Journeys,	1
London,	1
servants,	1
horses,	1
table--	1
contractions	1
and	1
restrictions	1
every	1
where!	1
To	1
live	1
no	1
longer	1
with	1
the	1
decencies	1
even	1
of	1
a	1
private	1
gentleman!	1
No,	1
he	1
would	1
sooner	1
quit	1
Kellynch	1
Hall	1
at	1
once,	1
than	1
remain	1
in	1
it	1
on	1
such	1
disgraceful	1
terms."	1
"Quit	1
Kellynch	1
Hall."	1
The	1
hint	1
was	1
immediately	1
taken	1
up	1
by	1
Mr	1
Shepherd,	1
whose	1
interest	1
was	1
involved	1
in	1
the	1
reality	1
of	1
Sir	1
Walter's	1
retrenching,	1
and	1
who	1
was	1
perfectly	1
persuaded	1
that	1
nothing	1
would	1
be	1
done	1
without	1
a	1
change	1
of	1
abode.	1
"Since	1
the	1
idea	1
had	1
been	1
started	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
quarter	1
which	1
ought	1
to	1
dictate,	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
scruple,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"in	1
confessing	1
his	1
judgement	1
to	1
be	1
entirely	1
on	1
that	1
side.	1
It	1
did	1
not	1
appear	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
could	1
materially	1
alter	1
his	1
style	1
of	1
living	1
in	1
a	1
house	1
which	1
had	1
such	1
a	1
character	1
of	1
hospitality	1
and	1
ancient	1
dignity	1
to	1
support.	1
In	1
any	1
other	1
place	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
might	1
judge	1
for	1
himself;	1
and	1
would	1
be	1
looked	1
up	1
to,	1
as	1
regulating	1
the	1
modes	1
of	1
life	1
in	1
whatever	1
way	1
he	1
might	1
choose	1
to	1
model	1
his	1
household."	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
would	1
quit	1
Kellynch	1
Hall;	1
and	1
after	1
a	1
very	1
few	1
days	1
more	1
of	1
doubt	1
and	1
indecision,	1
the	1
great	1
question	1
of	1
whither	1
he	1
should	1
go	1
was	1
settled,	1
and	1
the	1
first	1
outline	1
of	1
this	1
important	1
change	1
made	1
out.	1
There	1
had	1
been	1
three	1
alternatives,	1
London,	1
Bath,	1
or	1
another	1
house	1
in	1
the	1
country.	1
All	1
Anne's	1
wishes	1
had	1
been	1
for	1
the	1
latter.	1
A	1
small	1
house	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
neighbourhood,	1
where	1
they	1
might	1
still	1
have	1
Lady	1
Russell's	1
society,	1
still	1
be	1
near	1
Mary,	1
and	1
still	1
have	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
sometimes	1
seeing	1
the	1
lawns	1
and	1
groves	1
of	1
Kellynch,	1
was	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
her	1
ambition.	1
But	1
the	1
usual	1
fate	1
of	1
Anne	1
attended	1
her,	1
in	1
having	1
something	1
very	1
opposite	1
from	1
her	1
inclination	1
fixed	1
on.	1
She	1
disliked	1
Bath,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
it	1
agreed	1
with	1
her;	1
and	1
Bath	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
her	1
home.	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
had	1
at	1
first	1
thought	1
more	1
of	1
London;	1
but	1
Mr	1
Shepherd	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
trusted	1
in	1
London,	1
and	1
had	1
been	1
skilful	1
enough	1
to	1
dissuade	1
him	1
from	1
it,	1
and	1
make	1
Bath	1
preferred.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
much	1
safer	1
place	1
for	1
a	1
gentleman	1
in	1
his	1
predicament:	1
he	1
might	1
there	1
be	1
important	1
at	1
comparatively	1
little	1
expense.	1
Two	1
material	1
advantages	1
of	1
Bath	1
over	1
London	1
had	1
of	1
course	1
been	1
given	1
all	1
their	1
weight:	1
its	1
more	1
convenient	1
distance	1
from	1
Kellynch,	1
only	1
fifty	1
miles,	1
and	1
Lady	1
Russell's	1
spending	1
some	1
part	1
of	1
every	1
winter	1
there;	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
very	1
great	1
satisfaction	1
of	1
Lady	1
Russell,	1
whose	1
first	1
views	1
on	1
the	1
projected	1
change	1
had	1
been	1
for	1
Bath,	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
were	1
induced	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
lose	1
neither	1
consequence	1
nor	1
enjoyment	1
by	1
settling	1
there.	1
Lady	1
Russell	1
felt	1
obliged	1
to	1
oppose	1
her	1
dear	1
Anne's	1
known	1
wishes.	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
too	1
much	1
to	1
expect	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
to	1
descend	1
into	1
a	1
small	1
house	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
neighbourhood.	1
Anne	1
herself	1
would	1
have	1
found	1
the	1
mortifications	1
of	1
it	1
more	1
than	1
she	1
foresaw,	1
and	1
to	1
Sir	1
Walter's	1
feelings	1
they	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
dreadful.	1
And	1
with	1
regard	1
to	1
Anne's	1
dislike	1
of	1
Bath,	1
she	1
considered	1
it	1
as	1
a	1
prejudice	1
and	1
mistake	1
arising,	1
first,	1
from	1
the	1
circumstance	1
of	1
her	1
having	1
been	1
three	1
years	1
at	1
school	1
there,	1
after	1
her	1
mother's	1
death;	1
and	1
secondly,	1
from	1
her	1
happening	1
to	1
be	1
not	1
in	1
perfectly	1
good	1
spirits	1
the	1
only	1
winter	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
afterwards	1
spent	1
there	1
with	1
herself.	1
Lady	1
Russell	1
was	1
fond	1
of	1
Bath,	1
in	1
short,	1
and	1
disposed	1
to	1
think	1
it	1
must	1
suit	1
them	1
all;	1
and	1
as	1
to	1
her	1
young	1
friend's	1
health,	1
by	1
passing	1
all	1
the	1
warm	1
months	1
with	1
her	1
at	1
Kellynch	1
Lodge,	1
every	1
danger	1
would	1
be	1
avoided;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
fact,	1
a	1
change	1
which	1
must	1
do	1
both	1
health	1
and	1
spirits	1
good.	1
Anne	1
had	1
been	1
too	1
little	1
from	1
home,	1
too	1
little	1
seen.	1
Her	1
spirits	1
were	1
not	1
high.	1
A	1
larger	1
society	1
would	1
improve	1
them.	1
She	1
wanted	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
more	1
known.	1
The	1
undesirableness	1
of	1
any	1
other	1
house	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
neighbourhood	1
for	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
was	1
certainly	1
much	1
strengthened	1
by	1
one	1
part,	1
and	1
a	1
very	1
material	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
scheme,	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
happily	1
engrafted	1
on	1
the	1
beginning.	1
He	1
was	1
not	1
only	1
to	1
quit	1
his	1
home,	1
but	1
to	1
see	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
others;	1
a	1
trial	1
of	1
fortitude,	1
which	1
stronger	1
heads	1
than	1
Sir	1
Walter's	1
have	1
found	1
too	1
much.	1
Kellynch	1
Hall	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
let.	1
This,	1
however,	1
was	1
a	1
profound	1
secret,	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
breathed	1
beyond	1
their	1
own	1
circle.	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
borne	1
the	1
degradation	1
of	1
being	1
known	1
to	1
design	1
letting	1
his	1
house.	1
Mr	1
Shepherd	1
had	1
once	1
mentioned	1
the	1
word	1
"advertise,"	1
but	1
never	1
dared	1
approach	1
it	1
again.	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
spurned	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
its	1
being	1
offered	1
in	1
any	1
manner;	1
forbad	1
the	1
slightest	1
hint	1
being	1
dropped	1
of	1
his	1
having	1
such	1
an	1
intention;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
on	1
the	1
supposition	1
of	1
his	1
being	1
spontaneously	1
solicited	1
by	1
some	1
most	1
unexceptionable	1
applicant,	1
on	1
his	1
own	1
terms,	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
great	1
favour,	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
let	1
it	1
at	1
all.	1
How	1
quick	1
come	1
the	1
reasons	1
for	1
approving	1
what	1
we	1
like!	1
Lady	1
Russell	1
had	1
another	1
excellent	1
one	1
at	1
hand,	1
for	1
being	1
extremely	1
glad	1
that	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
and	1
his	1
family	1
were	1
to	1
remove	1
from	1
the	1
country.	1
Elizabeth	1
had	1
been	1
lately	1
forming	1
an	1
intimacy,	1
which	1
she	1
wished	1
to	1
see	1
interrupted.	1
It	1
was	1
with	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Mr	1
Shepherd,	1
who	1
had	1
returned,	1
after	1
an	1
unprosperous	1
marriage,	1
to	1
her	1
father's	1
house,	1
with	1
the	1
additional	1
burden	1
of	1
two	1
children.	1
She	1
was	1
a	1
clever	1
young	1
woman,	1
who	1
understood	1
the	1
art	1
of	1
pleasing--the	1
art	1
of	1
pleasing,	1
at	1
least,	1
at	1
Kellynch	1
Hall;	1
and	1
who	1
had	1
made	1
herself	1
so	1
acceptable	1
to	1
Miss	1
Elliot,	1
as	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
already	1
staying	1
there	1
more	1
than	1
once,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
Lady	1
Russell,	1
who	1
thought	1
it	1
a	1
friendship	1
quite	1
out	1
of	1
place,	1
could	1
hint	1
of	1
caution	1
and	1
reserve.	1
Lady	1
Russell,	1
indeed,	1
had	1
scarcely	1
any	1
influence	1
with	1
Elizabeth,	1
and	1
seemed	1
to	1
love	1
her,	1
rather	1
because	1
she	1
would	1
love	1
her,	1
than	1
because	1
Elizabeth	1
deserved	1
it.	1
She	1
had	1
never	1
received	1
from	1
her	1
more	1
than	1
outward	1
attention,	1
nothing	1
beyond	1
the	1
observances	1
of	1
complaisance;	1
had	1
never	1
succeeded	1
in	1
any	1
point	1
which	1
she	1
wanted	1
to	1
carry,	1
against	1
previous	1
inclination.	1
She	1
had	1
been	1
repeatedly	1
very	1
earnest	1
in	1
trying	1
to	1
get	1
Anne	1
included	1
in	1
the	1
visit	1
to	1
London,	1
sensibly	1
open	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
injustice	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
discredit	1
of	1
the	1
selfish	1
arrangements	1
which	1
shut	1
her	1
out,	1
and	1
on	1
many	1
lesser	1
occasions	1
had	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
give	1
Elizabeth	1
the	1
advantage	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
better	1
judgement	1
and	1
experience;	1
but	1
always	1
in	1
vain:	1
Elizabeth	1
would	1
go	1
her	1
own	1
way;	1
and	1
never	1
had	1
she	1
pursued	1
it	1
in	1
more	1
decided	1
opposition	1
to	1
Lady	1
Russell	1
than	1
in	1
this	1
selection	1
of	1
Mrs	1
Clay;	1
turning	1
from	1
the	1
society	1
of	1
so	1
deserving	1
a	1
sister,	1
to	1
bestow	1
her	1
affection	1
and	1
confidence	1
on	1
one	1
who	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
nothing	1
to	1
her	1
but	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
distant	1
civility.	1
From	1
situation,	1
Mrs	1
Clay	1
was,	1
in	1
Lady	1
Russell's	1
estimate,	1
a	1
very	1
unequal,	1
and	1
in	1
her	1
character	1
she	1
believed	1
a	1
very	1
dangerous	1
companion;	1
and	1
a	1
removal	1
that	1
would	1
leave	1
Mrs	1
Clay	1
behind,	1
and	1
bring	1
a	1
choice	1
of	1
more	1
suitable	1
intimates	1
within	1
Miss	1
Elliot's	1
reach,	1
was	1
therefore	1
an	1
object	1
of	1
first-rate	1
importance.	1
Chapter	1
3	1
"I	1
must	1
take	1
leave	1
to	1
observe,	1
Sir	1
Walter,"	1
said	1
Mr	1
Shepherd	1
one	1
morning	1
at	1
Kellynch	1
Hall,	1
as	1
he	1
laid	1
down	1
the	1
newspaper,	1
"that	1
the	1
present	1
juncture	1
is	1
much	1
in	1
our	1
favour.	1
This	1
peace	1
will	1
be	1
turning	1
all	1
our	1
rich	1
naval	1
officers	1
ashore.	1
They	1
will	1
be	1
all	1
wanting	1
a	1
home.	1
Could	1
not	1
be	1
a	1
better	1
time,	1
Sir	1
Walter,	1
for	1
having	1
a	1
choice	1
of	1
tenants,	1
very	1
responsible	1
tenants.	1
Many	1
a	1
noble	1
fortune	1
has	1
been	1
made	1
during	1
the	1
war.	1
If	1
a	1
rich	1
admiral	1
were	1
to	1
come	1
in	1
our	1
way,	1
Sir	1
Walter--"	1
"He	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
very	1
lucky	1
man,	1
Shepherd,"	1
replied	1
Sir	1
Walter;	1
"that's	1
all	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
remark.	1
A	1
prize	1
indeed	1
would	1
Kellynch	1
Hall	1
be	1
to	1
him;	1
rather	1
the	1
greatest	1
prize	1
of	1
all,	1
let	1
him	1
have	1
taken	1
ever	1
so	1
many	1
before;	1
hey,	1
Shepherd?"	1
Mr	1
Shepherd	1
laughed,	1
as	1
he	1
knew	1
he	1
must,	1
at	1
this	1
wit,	1
and	1
then	1
added--	1
"I	1
presume	1
to	1
observe,	1
Sir	1
Walter,	1
that,	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
business,	1
gentlemen	1
of	1
the	1
navy	1
are	1
well	1
to	1
deal	1
with.	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
a	1
little	1
knowledge	1
of	1
their	1
methods	1
of	1
doing	1
business;	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
free	1
to	1
confess	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
very	1
liberal	1
notions,	1
and	1
are	1
as	1
likely	1
to	1
make	1
desirable	1
tenants	1
as	1
any	1
set	1
of	1
people	1
one	1
should	1
meet	1
with.	1
Therefore,	1
Sir	1
Walter,	1
what	1
I	1
would	1
take	1
leave	1
to	1
suggest	1
is,	1
that	1
if	1
in	1
consequence	1
of	1
any	1
rumours	1
getting	1
abroad	1
of	1
your	1
intention;	1
which	1
must	1
be	1
contemplated	1
as	1
a	1
possible	1
thing,	1
because	1
we	1
know	1
how	1
difficult	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
actions	1
and	1
designs	1
of	1
one	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
from	1
the	1
notice	1
and	1
curiosity	1
of	1
the	1
other;	1
consequence	1
has	1
its	1
tax;	1
I,	1
John	1
Shepherd,	1
might	1
conceal	1
any	1
family-matters	1
that	1
I	1
chose,	1
for	1
nobody	1
would	1
think	1
it	1
worth	1
their	1
while	1
to	1
observe	1
me;	1
but	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
Elliot	1
has	1
eyes	1
upon	1
him	1
which	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
very	1
difficult	1
to	1
elude;	1
and	1
therefore,	1
thus	1
much	1
I	1
venture	1
upon,	1
that	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
greatly	1
surprise	1
me	1
if,	1
with	1
all	1
our	1
caution,	1
some	1
rumour	1
of	1
the	1
truth	1
should	1
get	1
abroad;	1
in	1
the	1
supposition	1
of	1
which,	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
observe,	1
since	1
applications	1
will	1
unquestionably	1
follow,	1
I	1
should	1
think	1
any	1
from	1
our	1
wealthy	1
naval	1
commanders	1
particularly	1
worth	1
attending	1
to;	1
and	1
beg	1
leave	1
to	1
add,	1
that	1
two	1
hours	1
will	1
bring	1
me	1
over	1
at	1
any	1
time,	1
to	1
save	1
you	1
the	1
trouble	1
of	1
replying."	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
only	1
nodded.	1
But	1
soon	1
afterwards,	1
rising	1
and	1
pacing	1
the	1
room,	1
he	1
observed	1
sarcastically--	1
"There	1
are	1
few	1
among	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
of	1
the	1
navy,	1
I	1
imagine,	1
who	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
surprised	1
to	1
find	1
themselves	1
in	1
a	1
house	1
of	1
this	1
description."	1
"They	1
would	1
look	1
around	1
them,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
and	1
bless	1
their	1
good	1
fortune,"	1
said	1
Mrs	1
Clay,	1
for	1
Mrs	1
Clay	1
was	1
present:	1
her	1
father	1
had	1
driven	1
her	1
over,	1
nothing	1
being	1
of	1
so	1
much	1
use	1
to	1
Mrs	1
Clay's	1
health	1
as	1
a	1
drive	1
to	1
Kellynch:	1
"but	1
I	1
quite	1
agree	1
with	1
my	1
father	1
in	1
thinking	1
a	1
sailor	1
might	1
be	1
a	1
very	1
desirable	1
tenant.	1
I	1
have	1
known	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
of	1
the	1
profession;	1
and	1
besides	1
their	1
liberality,	1
they	1
are	1
so	1
neat	1
and	1
careful	1
in	1
all	1
their	1
ways!	1
These	1
valuable	1
pictures	1
of	1
yours,	1
Sir	1
Walter,	1
if	1
you	1
chose	1
to	1
leave	1
them,	1
would	1
be	1
perfectly	1
safe.	1
Everything	1
in	1
and	1
about	1
the	1
house	1
would	1
be	1
taken	1
such	1
excellent	1
care	1
of!	1
The	1
gardens	1
and	1
shrubberies	1
would	1
be	1
kept	1
in	1
almost	1
as	1
high	1
order	1
as	1
they	1
are	1
now.	1
You	1
need	1
not	1
be	1
afraid,	1
Miss	1
Elliot,	1
of	1
your	1
own	1
sweet	1
flower	1
gardens	1
being	1
neglected."	1
"As	1
to	1
all	1
that,"	1
rejoined	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
coolly,	1
"supposing	1
I	1
were	1
induced	1
to	1
let	1
my	1
house,	1
I	1
have	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
made	1
up	1
my	1
mind	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
privileges	1
to	1
be	1
annexed	1
to	1
it.	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
particularly	1
disposed	1
to	1
favour	1
a	1
tenant.	1
The	1
park	1
would	1
be	1
open	1
to	1
him	1
of	1
course,	1
and	1
few	1
navy	1
officers,	1
or	1
men	1
of	1
any	1
other	1
description,	1
can	1
have	1
had	1
such	1
a	1
range;	1
but	1
what	1
restrictions	1
I	1
might	1
impose	1
on	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
the	1
pleasure-grounds,	1
is	1
another	1
thing.	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
fond	1
of	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
my	1
shrubberies	1
being	1
always	1
approachable;	1
and	1
I	1
should	1
recommend	1
Miss	1
Elliot	1
to	1
be	1
on	1
her	1
guard	1
with	1
respect	1
to	1
her	1
flower	1
garden.	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
little	1
disposed	1
to	1
grant	1
a	1
tenant	1
of	1
Kellynch	1
Hall	1
any	1
extraordinary	1
favour,	1
I	1
assure	1
you,	1
be	1
he	1
sailor	1
or	1
soldier."	1
After	1
a	1
short	1
pause,	1
Mr	1
Shepherd	1
presumed	1
to	1
say--	1
"In	1
all	1
these	1
cases,	1
there	1
are	1
established	1
usages	1
which	1
make	1
everything	1
plain	1
and	1
easy	1
between	1
landlord	1
and	1
tenant.	1
Your	1
interest,	1
Sir	1
Walter,	1
is	1
in	1
pretty	1
safe	1
hands.	1
Depend	1
upon	1
me	1
for	1
taking	1
care	1
that	1
no	1
tenant	1
has	1
more	1
than	1
his	1
just	1
rights.	1
I	1
venture	1
to	1
hint,	1
that	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
Elliot	1
cannot	1
be	1
half	1
so	1
jealous	1
for	1
his	1
own,	1
as	1
John	1
Shepherd	1
will	1
be	1
for	1
him."	1
Here	1
Anne	1
spoke--	1
"The	1
navy,	1
I	1
think,	1
who	1
have	1
done	1
so	1
much	1
for	1
us,	1
have	1
at	1
least	1
an	1
equal	1
claim	1
with	1
any	1
other	1
set	1
of	1
men,	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
comforts	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
privileges	1
which	1
any	1
home	1
can	1
give.	1
Sailors	1
work	1
hard	1
enough	1
for	1
their	1
comforts,	1
we	1
must	1
all	1
allow."	1
"Very	1
true,	1
very	1
true.	1
What	1
Miss	1
Anne	1
says,	1
is	1
very	1
true,"	1
was	1
Mr	1
Shepherd's	1
rejoinder,	1
and	1
"Oh!	1
certainly,"	1
was	1
his	1
daughter's;	1
but	1
Sir	1
Walter's	1
remark	1
was,	1
soon	1
afterwards--	1
"The	1
profession	1
has	1
its	1
utility,	1
but	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
sorry	1
to	1
see	1
any	1
friend	1
of	1
mine	1
belonging	1
to	1
it."	1
"Indeed!"	1
was	1
the	1
reply,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
surprise.	1
"Yes;	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
two	1
points	1
offensive	1
to	1
me;	1
I	1
have	1
two	1
strong	1
grounds	1
of	1
objection	1
to	1
it.	1
First,	1
as	1
being	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
bringing	1
persons	1
of	1
obscure	1
birth	1
into	1
undue	1
distinction,	1
and	1
raising	1
men	1
to	1
honours	1
which	1
their	1
fathers	1
and	1
grandfathers	1
never	1
dreamt	1
of;	1
and	1
secondly,	1
as	1
it	1
cuts	1
up	1
a	1
man's	1
youth	1
and	1
vigour	1
most	1
horribly;	1
a	1
sailor	1
grows	1
old	1
sooner	1
than	1
any	1
other	1
man.	1
I	1
have	1
observed	1
it	1
all	1
my	1
life.	1
A	1
man	1
is	1
in	1
greater	1
danger	1
in	1
the	1
navy	1
of	1
being	1
insulted	1
by	1
the	1
rise	1
of	1
one	1
whose	1
father,	1
his	1
father	1
might	1
have	1
disdained	1
to	1
speak	1
to,	1
and	1
of	1
becoming	1
prematurely	1
an	1
object	1
of	1
disgust	1
himself,	1
than	1
in	1
any	1
other	1
line.	1
One	1
day	1
last	1
spring,	1
in	1
town,	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
company	1
with	1
two	1
men,	1
striking	1
instances	1
of	1
what	1
I	1
am	1
talking	1
of;	1
Lord	1
St	1
Ives,	1
whose	1
father	1
we	1
all	1
know	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
country	1
curate,	1
without	1
bread	1
to	1
eat;	1
I	1
was	1
to	1
give	1
place	1
to	1
Lord	1
St	1
Ives,	1
and	1
a	1
certain	1
Admiral	1
Baldwin,	1
the	1
most	1
deplorable-looking	1
personage	1
you	1
can	1
imagine;	1
his	1
face	1
the	1
colour	1
of	1
mahogany,	1
rough	1
and	1
rugged	1
to	1
the	1
last	1
degree;	1
all	1
lines	1
and	1
wrinkles,	1
nine	1
grey	1
hairs	1
of	1
a	1
side,	1
and	1
nothing	1
but	1
a	1
dab	1
of	1
powder	1
at	1
top.	1
`In	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
heaven,	1
who	1
is	1
that	1
old	1
fellow?'	1
said	1
I	1
to	1
a	1
friend	1
of	1
mine	1
who	1
was	1
standing	1
near,	1
(Sir	1
Basil	1
Morley).	1
`Old	1
fellow!'	1
cried	1
Sir	1
Basil,	1
`it	1
is	1
Admiral	1
Baldwin.	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
take	1
his	1
age	1
to	1
be?'	1
`Sixty,'	1
said	1
I,	1
`or	1
perhaps	1
sixty-two.'	1
`Forty,'	1
replied	1
Sir	1
Basil,	1
`forty,	1
and	1
no	1
more.'	1
Picture	1
to	1
yourselves	1
my	1
amazement;	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
easily	1
forget	1
Admiral	1
Baldwin.	1
I	1
never	1
saw	1
quite	1
so	1
wretched	1
an	1
example	1
of	1
what	1
a	1
sea-faring	1
life	1
can	1
do;	1
but	1
to	1
a	1
degree,	1
I	1
know	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
same	1
with	1
them	1
all:	1
they	1
are	1
all	1
knocked	1
about,	1
and	1
exposed	1
to	1
every	1
climate,	1
and	1
every	1
weather,	1
till	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
fit	1
to	1
be	1
seen.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
pity	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
knocked	1
on	1
the	1
head	1
at	1
once,	1
before	1
they	1
reach	1
Admiral	1
Baldwin's	1
age."	1
"Nay,	1
Sir	1
Walter,"	1
cried	1
Mrs	1
Clay,	1
"this	1
is	1
being	1
severe	1
indeed.	1
Have	1
a	1
little	1
mercy	1
on	1
the	1
poor	1
men.	1
We	1
are	1
not	1
all	1
born	1
to	1
be	1
handsome.	1
The	1
sea	1
is	1
no	1
beautifier,	1
certainly;	1
sailors	1
do	1
grow	1
old	1
betimes;	1
I	1
have	1
observed	1
it;	1
they	1
soon	1
lose	1
the	1
look	1
of	1
youth.	1
But	1
then,	1
is	1
not	1
it	1
the	1
same	1
with	1
many	1
other	1
professions,	1
perhaps	1
most	1
other?	1
Soldiers,	1
in	1
active	1
service,	1
are	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
better	1
off:	1
and	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
quieter	1
professions,	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
toil	1
and	1
a	1
labour	1
of	1
the	1
mind,	1
if	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
body,	1
which	1
seldom	1
leaves	1
a	1
man's	1
looks	1
to	1
the	1
natural	1
effect	1
of	1
time.	1
The	1
lawyer	1
plods,	1
quite	1
care-worn;	1
the	1
physician	1
is	1
up	1
at	1
all	1
hours,	1
and	1
travelling	1
in	1
all	1
weather;	1
and	1
even	1
the	1
clergyman--"	1
she	1
stopt	1
a	1
moment	1
to	1
consider	1
what	1
might	1
do	1
for	1
the	1
clergyman;--"and	1
even	1
the	1
clergyman,	1
you	1
know	1
is	1
obliged	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
infected	1
rooms,	1
and	1
expose	1
his	1
health	1
and	1
looks	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
injury	1
of	1
a	1
poisonous	1
atmosphere.	1
In	1
fact,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
long	1
been	1
convinced,	1
though	1
every	1
profession	1
is	1
necessary	1
and	1
honourable	1
in	1
its	1
turn,	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
the	1
lot	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
not	1
obliged	1
to	1
follow	1
any,	1
who	1
can	1
live	1
in	1
a	1
regular	1
way,	1
in	1
the	1
country,	1
choosing	1
their	1
own	1
hours,	1
following	1
their	1
own	1
pursuits,	1
and	1
living	1
on	1
their	1
own	1
property,	1
without	1
the	1
torment	1
of	1
trying	1
for	1
more;	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
their	1
lot,	1
I	1
say,	1
to	1
hold	1
the	1
blessings	1
of	1
health	1
and	1
a	1
good	1
appearance	1
to	1
the	1
utmost:	1
I	1
know	1
no	1
other	1
set	1
of	1
men	1
but	1
what	1
lose	1
something	1
of	1
their	1
personableness	1
when	1
they	1
cease	1
to	1
be	1
quite	1
young."	1
It	1
seemed	1
as	1
if	1
Mr	1
Shepherd,	1
in	1
this	1
anxiety	1
to	1
bespeak	1
Sir	1
Walter's	1
good	1
will	1
towards	1
a	1
naval	1
officer	1
as	1
tenant,	1
had	1
been	1
gifted	1
with	1
foresight;	1
for	1
the	1
very	1
first	1
application	1
for	1
the	1
house	1
was	1
from	1
an	1
Admiral	1
Croft,	1
with	1
whom	1
he	1
shortly	1
afterwards	1
fell	1
into	1
company	1
in	1
attending	1
the	1
quarter	1
sessions	1
at	1
Taunton;	1
and	1
indeed,	1
he	1
had	1
received	1
a	1
hint	1
of	1
the	1
Admiral	1
from	1
a	1
London	1
correspondent.	1
By	1
the	1
report	1
which	1
he	1
hastened	1
over	1
to	1
Kellynch	1
to	1
make,	1
Admiral	1
Croft	1
was	1
a	1
native	1
of	1
Somersetshire,	1
who	1
having	1
acquired	1
a	1
very	1
handsome	1
fortune,	1
was	1
wishing	1
to	1
settle	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
country,	1
and	1
had	1
come	1
down	1
to	1
Taunton	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
some	1
advertised	1
places	1
in	1
that	1
immediate	1
neighbourhood,	1
which,	1
however,	1
had	1
not	1
suited	1
him;	1
that	1
accidentally	1
hearing--(it	1
was	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
foretold,	1
Mr	1
Shepherd	1
observed,	1
Sir	1
Walter's	1
concerns	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
kept	1
a	1
secret,)--	1
accidentally	1
hearing	1
of	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
Kellynch	1
Hall	1
being	1
to	1
let,	1
and	1
understanding	1
his	1
(Mr	1
Shepherd's)	1
connection	1
with	1
the	1
owner,	1
he	1
had	1
introduced	1
himself	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
make	1
particular	1
inquiries,	1
and	1
had,	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
a	1
pretty	1
long	1
conference,	1
expressed	1
as	1
strong	1
an	1
inclination	1
for	1
the	1
place	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
knew	1
it	1
only	1
by	1
description	1
could	1
feel;	1
and	1
given	1
Mr	1
Shepherd,	1
in	1
his	1
explicit	1
account	1
of	1
himself,	1
every	1
proof	1
of	1
his	1
being	1
a	1
most	1
responsible,	1
eligible	1
tenant.	1
"And	1
who	1
is	1
Admiral	1
Croft?"	1
was	1
Sir	1
Walter's	1
cold	1
suspicious	1
inquiry.	1
Mr	1
Shepherd	1
answered	1
for	1
his	1
being	1
of	1
a	1
gentleman's	1
family,	1
and	1
mentioned	1
a	1
place;	1
and	1
Anne,	1
after	1
the	1
little	1
pause	1
which	1
followed,	1
added--	1
"He	1
is	1
a	1
rear	1
admiral	1
of	1
the	1
white.	1
He	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
Trafalgar	1
action,	1
and	1
has	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
East	1
Indies	1
since;	1
he	1
was	1
stationed	1
there,	1
I	1
believe,	1
several	1
years."	1
"Then	1
I	1
take	1
it	1
for	1
granted,"	1
observed	1
Sir	1
Walter,	1
"that	1
his	1
face	1
is	1
about	1
as	1
orange	1
as	1
the	1
cuffs	1
and	1
capes	1
of	1
my	1
livery."	1
Mr	1
Shepherd	1
hastened	1
to	1
assure	1
him,	1
that	1
Admiral	1
Croft	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
hale,	1
hearty,	1
well-looking	1
man,	1
a	1
little	1
weather-beaten,	1
to	1
be	1
sure,	1
but	1
not	1
much,	1
and	1
quite	1
the	1
gentleman	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
notions	1
and	1
behaviour;	1
not	1
likely	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
smallest	1
difficulty	1
about	1
terms,	1
only	1
wanted	1
a	1
comfortable	1
home,	1
and	1
to	1
get	1
into	1
it	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
possible;	1
knew	1
he	1
must	1
pay	1
for	1
his	1
convenience;	1
knew	1
what	1
rent	1
a	1
ready-furnished	1
house	1
of	1
that	1
consequence	1
might	1
fetch;	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
surprised	1
if	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
had	1
asked	1
more;	1
had	1
inquired	1
about	1
the	1
manor;	1
would	1
be	1
glad	1
of	1
the	1
deputation,	1
certainly,	1
but	1
made	1
no	1
great	1
point	1
of	1
it;	1
said	1
he	1
sometimes	1
took	1
out	1
a	1
gun,	1
but	1
never	1
killed;	1
quite	1
the	1
gentleman.	1
Mr	1
Shepherd	1
was	1
eloquent	1
on	1
the	1
subject;	1
pointing	1
out	1
all	1
the	1
circumstances	1
of	1
the	1
Admiral's	1
family,	1
which	1
made	1
him	1
peculiarly	1
desirable	1
as	1
a	1
tenant.	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
married	1
man,	1
and	1
without	1
children;	1
the	1
very	1
state	1
to	1
be	1
wished	1
for.	1
A	1
house	1
was	1
never	1
taken	1
good	1
care	1
of,	1
Mr	1
Shepherd	1
observed,	1
without	1
a	1
lady:	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know,	1
whether	1
furniture	1
might	1
not	1
be	1
in	1
danger	1
of	1
suffering	1
as	1
much	1
where	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
lady,	1
as	1
where	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
children.	1
A	1
lady,	1
without	1
a	1
family,	1
was	1
the	1
very	1
best	1
preserver	1
of	1
furniture	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
He	1
had	1
seen	1
Mrs	1
Croft,	1
too;	1
she	1
was	1
at	1
Taunton	1
with	1
the	1
admiral,	1
and	1
had	1
been	1
present	1
almost	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
they	1
were	1
talking	1
the	1
matter	1
over.	1
"And	1
a	1
very	1
well-spoken,	1
genteel,	1
shrewd	1
lady,	1
she	1
seemed	1
to	1
be,"	1
continued	1
he;	1
"asked	1
more	1
questions	1
about	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
terms,	1
and	1
taxes,	1
than	1
the	1
Admiral	1
himself,	1
and	1
seemed	1
more	1
conversant	1
with	1
business;	1
and	1
moreover,	1
Sir	1
Walter,	1
I	1
found	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
quite	1
unconnected	1
in	1
this	1
country,	1
any	1
more	1
than	1
her	1
husband;	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
she	1
is	1
sister	1
to	1
a	1
gentleman	1
who	1
did	1
live	1
amongst	1
us	1
once;	1
she	1
told	1
me	1
so	1
herself:	1
sister	1
to	1
the	1
gentleman	1
who	1
lived	1
a	1
few	1
years	1
back	1
at	1
Monkford.	1
Bless	1
me!	1
what	1
was	1
his	1
name?	1
At	1
this	1
moment	1
I	1
cannot	1
recollect	1
his	1
name,	1
though	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
it	1
so	1
lately.	1
Penelope,	1
my	1
dear,	1
can	1
you	1
help	1
me	1
to	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
gentleman	1
who	1
lived	1
at	1
Monkford:	1
Mrs	1
Croft's	1
brother?"	1
But	1
Mrs	1
Clay	1
was	1
talking	1
so	1
eagerly	1
with	1
Miss	1
Elliot,	1
that	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
hear	1
the	1
appeal.	1
"I	1
have	1
no	1
conception	1
whom	1
you	1
can	1
mean,	1
Shepherd;	1
I	1
remember	1
no	1
gentleman	1
resident	1
at	1
Monkford	1
since	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
old	1
Governor	1
Trent."	1
"Bless	1
me!	1
how	1
very	1
odd!	1
I	1
shall	1
forget	1
my	1
own	1
name	1
soon,	1
I	1
suppose.	1
A	1
name	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
so	1
very	1
well	1
acquainted	1
with;	1
knew	1
the	1
gentleman	1
so	1
well	1
by	1
sight;	1
seen	1
him	1
a	1
hundred	1
times;	1
came	1
to	1
consult	1
me	1
once,	1
I	1
remember,	1
about	1
a	1
trespass	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
neighbours;	1
farmer's	1
man	1
breaking	1
into	1
his	1
orchard;	1
wall	1
torn	1
down;	1
apples	1
stolen;	1
caught	1
in	1
the	1
fact;	1
and	1
afterwards,	1
contrary	1
to	1
my	1
judgement,	1
submitted	1
to	1
an	1
amicable	1
compromise.	1
Very	1
odd	1
indeed!"	1
After	1
waiting	1
another	1
moment--	1
"You	1
mean	1
Mr	1
Wentworth,	1
I	1
suppose?"	1
said	1
Anne.	1
Mr	1
Shepherd	1
was	1
all	1
gratitude.	1
"Wentworth	1
was	1
the	1
very	1
name!	1
Mr	1
Wentworth	1
was	1
the	1
very	1
man.	1
He	1
had	1
the	1
curacy	1
of	1
Monkford,	1
you	1
know,	1
Sir	1
Walter,	1
some	1
time	1
back,	1
for	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
years.	1
Came	1
there	1
about	1
the	1
year	1
---5,	1
I	1
take	1
it.	1
You	1
remember	1
him,	1
I	1
am	1
sure."	1
"Wentworth?	1
Oh!	1
ay,--Mr	1
Wentworth,	1
the	1
curate	1
of	1
Monkford.	1
You	1
misled	1
me	1
by	1
the	1
term	1
gentleman.	1
I	1
thought	1
you	1
were	1
speaking	1
of	1
some	1
man	1
of	1
property:	1
Mr	1
Wentworth	1
was	1
nobody,	1
I	1
remember;	1
quite	1
unconnected;	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
the	1
Strafford	1
family.	1
One	1
wonders	1
how	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
many	1
of	1
our	1
nobility	1
become	1
so	1
common."	1
As	1
Mr	1
Shepherd	1
perceived	1
that	1
this	1
connexion	1
of	1
the	1
Crofts	1
did	1
them	1
no	1
service	1
with	1
Sir	1
Walter,	1
he	1
mentioned	1
it	1
no	1
more;	1
returning,	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
zeal,	1
to	1
dwell	1
on	1
the	1
circumstances	1
more	1
indisputably	1
in	1
their	1
favour;	1
their	1
age,	1
and	1
number,	1
and	1
fortune;	1
the	1
high	1
idea	1
they	1
had	1
formed	1
of	1
Kellynch	1
Hall,	1
and	1
extreme	1
solicitude	1
for	1
the	1
advantage	1
of	1
renting	1
it;	1
making	1
it	1
appear	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
ranked	1
nothing	1
beyond	1
the	1
happiness	1
of	1
being	1
the	1
tenants	1
of	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
Elliot:	1
an	1
extraordinary	1
taste,	1
certainly,	1
could	1
they	1
have	1
been	1
supposed	1
in	1
the	1
secret	1
of	1
Sir	1
Walter's	1
estimate	1
of	1
the	1
dues	1
of	1
a	1
tenant.	1
It	1
succeeded,	1
however;	1
and	1
though	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
must	1
ever	1
look	1
with	1
an	1
evil	1
eye	1
on	1
anyone	1
intending	1
to	1
inhabit	1
that	1
house,	1
and	1
think	1
them	1
infinitely	1
too	1
well	1
off	1
in	1
being	1
permitted	1
to	1
rent	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
highest	1
terms,	1
he	1
was	1
talked	1
into	1
allowing	1
Mr	1
Shepherd	1
to	1
proceed	1
in	1
the	1
treaty,	1
and	1
authorising	1
him	1
to	1
wait	1
on	1
Admiral	1
Croft,	1
who	1
still	1
remained	1
at	1
Taunton,	1
and	1
fix	1
a	1
day	1
for	1
the	1
house	1
being	1
seen.	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
was	1
not	1
very	1
wise;	1
but	1
still	1
he	1
had	1
experience	1
enough	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
feel,	1
that	1
a	1
more	1
unobjectionable	1
tenant,	1
in	1
all	1
essentials,	1
than	1
Admiral	1
Croft	1
bid	1
fair	1
to	1
be,	1
could	1
hardly	1
offer.	1
So	1
far	1
went	1
his	1
understanding;	1
and	1
his	1
vanity	1
supplied	1
a	1
little	1
additional	1
soothing,	1
in	1
the	1
Admiral's	1
situation	1
in	1
life,	1
which	1
was	1
just	1
high	1
enough,	1
and	1
not	1
too	1
high.	1
"I	1
have	1
let	1
my	1
house	1
to	1
Admiral	1
Croft,"	1
would	1
sound	1
extremely	1
well;	1
very	1
much	1
better	1
than	1
to	1
any	1
mere	1
Mr--;	1
a	1
Mr	1
(save,	1
perhaps,	1
some	1
half	1
dozen	1
in	1
the	1
nation,)	1
always	1
needs	1
a	1
note	1
of	1
explanation.	1
An	1
admiral	1
speaks	1
his	1
own	1
consequence,	1
and,	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
can	1
never	1
make	1
a	1
baronet	1
look	1
small.	1
In	1
all	1
their	1
dealings	1
and	1
intercourse,	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
Elliot	1
must	1
ever	1
have	1
the	1
precedence.	1
Nothing	1
could	1
be	1
done	1
without	1
a	1
reference	1
to	1
Elizabeth:	1
but	1
her	1
inclination	1
was	1
growing	1
so	1
strong	1
for	1
a	1
removal,	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
happy	1
to	1
have	1
it	1
fixed	1
and	1
expedited	1
by	1
a	1
tenant	1
at	1
hand;	1
and	1
not	1
a	1
word	1
to	1
suspend	1
decision	1
was	1
uttered	1
by	1
her.	1
Mr	1
Shepherd	1
was	1
completely	1
empowered	1
to	1
act;	1
and	1
no	1
sooner	1
had	1
such	1
an	1
end	1
been	1
reached,	1
than	1
Anne,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
most	1
attentive	1
listener	1
to	1
the	1
whole,	1
left	1
the	1
room,	1
to	1
seek	1
the	1
comfort	1
of	1
cool	1
air	1
for	1
her	1
flushed	1
cheeks;	1
and	1
as	1
she	1
walked	1
along	1
a	1
favourite	1
grove,	1
said,	1
with	1
a	1
gentle	1
sigh,	1
"A	1
few	1
months	1
more,	1
and	1
he,	1
perhaps,	1
may	1
be	1
walking	1
here."	1
Chapter	1
4	1
He	1
was	1
not	1
Mr	1
Wentworth,	1
the	1
former	1
curate	1
of	1
Monkford,	1
however	1
suspicious	1
appearances	1
may	1
be,	1
but	1
a	1
Captain	1
Frederick	1
Wentworth,	1
his	1
brother,	1
who	1
being	1
made	1
commander	1
in	1
consequence	1
of	1
the	1
action	1
off	1
St	1
Domingo,	1
and	1
not	1
immediately	1
employed,	1
had	1
come	1
into	1
Somersetshire,	1
in	1
the	1
summer	1
of	1
1806;	1
and	1
having	1
no	1
parent	1
living,	1
found	1
a	1
home	1
for	1
half	1
a	1
year	1
at	1
Monkford.	1
He	1
was,	1
at	1
that	1
time,	1
a	1
remarkably	1
fine	1
young	1
man,	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
intelligence,	1
spirit,	1
and	1
brilliancy;	1
and	1
Anne	1
an	1
extremely	1
pretty	1
girl,	1
with	1
gentleness,	1
modesty,	1
taste,	1
and	1
feeling.	1
Half	1
the	1
sum	1
of	1
attraction,	1
on	1
either	1
side,	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
enough,	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
nothing	1
to	1
do,	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
hardly	1
anybody	1
to	1
love;	1
but	1
the	1
encounter	1
of	1
such	1
lavish	1
recommendations	1
could	1
not	1
fail.	1
They	1
were	1
gradually	1
acquainted,	1
and	1
when	1
acquainted,	1
rapidly	1
and	1
deeply	1
in	1
love.	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
difficult	1
to	1
say	1
which	1
had	1
seen	1
highest	1
perfection	1
in	1
the	1
other,	1
or	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
happiest:	1
she,	1
in	1
receiving	1
his	1
declarations	1
and	1
proposals,	1
or	1
he	1
in	1
having	1
them	1
accepted.	1
A	1
short	1
period	1
of	1
exquisite	1
felicity	1
followed,	1
and	1
but	1
a	1
short	1
one.	1
Troubles	1
soon	1
arose.	1
Sir	1
Walter,	1
on	1
being	1
applied	1
to,	1
without	1
actually	1
withholding	1
his	1
consent,	1
or	1
saying	1
it	1
should	1
never	1
be,	1
gave	1
it	1
all	1
the	1
negative	1
of	1
great	1
astonishment,	1
great	1
coldness,	1
great	1
silence,	1
and	1
a	1
professed	1
resolution	1
of	1
doing	1
nothing	1
for	1
his	1
daughter.	1
He	1
thought	1
it	1
a	1
very	1
degrading	1
alliance;	1
and	1
Lady	1
Russell,	1
though	1
with	1
more	1
tempered	1
and	1
pardonable	1
pride,	1
received	1
it	1
as	1
a	1
most	1
unfortunate	1
one.	1
Anne	1
Elliot,	1
with	1
all	1
her	1
claims	1
of	1
birth,	1
beauty,	1
and	1
mind,	1
to	1
throw	1
herself	1
away	1
at	1
nineteen;	1
involve	1
herself	1
at	1
nineteen	1
in	1
an	1
engagement	1
with	1
a	1
young	1
man,	1
who	1
had	1
nothing	1
but	1
himself	1
to	1
recommend	1
him,	1
and	1
no	1
hopes	1
of	1
attaining	1
affluence,	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
chances	1
of	1
a	1
most	1
uncertain	1
profession,	1
and	1
no	1
connexions	1
to	1
secure	1
even	1
his	1
farther	1
rise	1
in	1
the	1
profession,	1
would	1
be,	1
indeed,	1
a	1
throwing	1
away,	1
which	1
she	1
grieved	1
to	1
think	1
of!	1
Anne	1
Elliot,	1
so	1
young;	1
known	1
to	1
so	1
few,	1
to	1
be	1
snatched	1
off	1
by	1
a	1
stranger	1
without	1
alliance	1
or	1
fortune;	1
or	1
rather	1
sunk	1
by	1
him	1
into	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
most	1
wearing,	1
anxious,	1
youth-killing	1
dependence!	1
It	1
must	1
not	1
be,	1
if	1
by	1
any	1
fair	1
interference	1
of	1
friendship,	1
any	1
representations	1
from	1
one	1
who	1
had	1
almost	1
a	1
mother's	1
love,	1
and	1
mother's	1
rights,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
prevented.	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
had	1
no	1
fortune.	1
He	1
had	1
been	1
lucky	1
in	1
his	1
profession;	1
but	1
spending	1
freely,	1
what	1
had	1
come	1
freely,	1
had	1
realized	1
nothing.	1
But	1
he	1
was	1
confident	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
soon	1
be	1
rich:	1
full	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
ardour,	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
soon	1
have	1
a	1
ship,	1
and	1
soon	1
be	1
on	1
a	1
station	1
that	1
would	1
lead	1
to	1
everything	1
he	1
wanted.	1
He	1
had	1
always	1
been	1
lucky;	1
he	1
knew	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
so	1
still.	1
Such	1
confidence,	1
powerful	1
in	1
its	1
own	1
warmth,	1
and	1
bewitching	1
in	1
the	1
wit	1
which	1
often	1
expressed	1
it,	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
enough	1
for	1
Anne;	1
but	1
Lady	1
Russell	1
saw	1
it	1
very	1
differently.	1
His	1
sanguine	1
temper,	1
and	1
fearlessness	1
of	1
mind,	1
operated	1
very	1
differently	1
on	1
her.	1
She	1
saw	1
in	1
it	1
but	1
an	1
aggravation	1
of	1
the	1
evil.	1
It	1
only	1
added	1
a	1
dangerous	1
character	1
to	1
himself.	1
He	1
was	1
brilliant,	1
he	1
was	1
headstrong.	1
Lady	1
Russell	1
had	1
little	1
taste	1
for	1
wit,	1
and	1
of	1
anything	1
approaching	1
to	1
imprudence	1
a	1
horror.	1
She	1
deprecated	1
the	1
connexion	1
in	1
every	1
light.	1
Such	1
opposition,	1
as	1
these	1
feelings	1
produced,	1
was	1
more	1
than	1
Anne	1
could	1
combat.	1
Young	1
and	1
gentle	1
as	1
she	1
was,	1
it	1
might	1
yet	1
have	1
been	1
possible	1
to	1
withstand	1
her	1
father's	1
ill-will,	1
though	1
unsoftened	1
by	1
one	1
kind	1
word	1
or	1
look	1
on	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
her	1
sister;	1
but	1
Lady	1
Russell,	1
whom	1
she	1
had	1
always	1
loved	1
and	1
relied	1
on,	1
could	1
not,	1
with	1
such	1
steadiness	1
of	1
opinion,	1
and	1
such	1
tenderness	1
of	1
manner,	1
be	1
continually	1
advising	1
her	1
in	1
vain.	1
She	1
was	1
persuaded	1
to	1
believe	1
the	1
engagement	1
a	1
wrong	1
thing:	1
indiscreet,	1
improper,	1
hardly	1
capable	1
of	1
success,	1
and	1
not	1
deserving	1
it.	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
merely	1
selfish	1
caution,	1
under	1
which	1
she	1
acted,	1
in	1
putting	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
it.	1
Had	1
she	1
not	1
imagined	1
herself	1
consulting	1
his	1
good,	1
even	1
more	1
than	1
her	1
own,	1
she	1
could	1
hardly	1
have	1
given	1
him	1
up.	1
The	1
belief	1
of	1
being	1
prudent,	1
and	1
self-denying,	1
principally	1
for	1
his	1
advantage,	1
was	1
her	1
chief	1
consolation,	1
under	1
the	1
misery	1
of	1
a	1
parting,	1
a	1
final	1
parting;	1
and	1
every	1
consolation	1
was	1
required,	1
for	1
she	1
had	1
to	1
encounter	1
all	1
the	1
additional	1
pain	1
of	1
opinions,	1
on	1
his	1
side,	1
totally	1
unconvinced	1
and	1
unbending,	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
feeling	1
himself	1
ill	1
used	1
by	1
so	1
forced	1
a	1
relinquishment.	1
He	1
had	1
left	1
the	1
country	1
in	1
consequence.	1
A	1
few	1
months	1
had	1
seen	1
the	1
beginning	1
and	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
their	1
acquaintance;	1
but	1
not	1
with	1
a	1
few	1
months	1
ended	1
Anne's	1
share	1
of	1
suffering	1
from	1
it.	1
Her	1
attachment	1
and	1
regrets	1
had,	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time,	1
clouded	1
every	1
enjoyment	1
of	1
youth,	1
and	1
an	1
early	1
loss	1
of	1
bloom	1
and	1
spirits	1
had	1
been	1
their	1
lasting	1
effect.	1
More	1
than	1
seven	1
years	1
were	1
gone	1
since	1
this	1
little	1
history	1
of	1
sorrowful	1
interest	1
had	1
reached	1
its	1
close;	1
and	1
time	1
had	1
softened	1
down	1
much,	1
perhaps	1
nearly	1
all	1
of	1
peculiar	1
attachment	1
to	1
him,	1
but	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
too	1
dependent	1
on	1
time	1
alone;	1
no	1
aid	1
had	1
been	1
given	1
in	1
change	1
of	1
place	1
(except	1
in	1
one	1
visit	1
to	1
Bath	1
soon	1
after	1
the	1
rupture),	1
or	1
in	1
any	1
novelty	1
or	1
enlargement	1
of	1
society.	1
No	1
one	1
had	1
ever	1
come	1
within	1
the	1
Kellynch	1
circle,	1
who	1
could	1
bear	1
a	1
comparison	1
with	1
Frederick	1
Wentworth,	1
as	1
he	1
stood	1
in	1
her	1
memory.	1
No	1
second	1
attachment,	1
the	1
only	1
thoroughly	1
natural,	1
happy,	1
and	1
sufficient	1
cure,	1
at	1
her	1
time	1
of	1
life,	1
had	1
been	1
possible	1
to	1
the	1
nice	1
tone	1
of	1
her	1
mind,	1
the	1
fastidiousness	1
of	1
her	1
taste,	1
in	1
the	1
small	1
limits	1
of	1
the	1
society	1
around	1
them.	1
She	1
had	1
been	1
solicited,	1
when	1
about	1
two-and-twenty,	1
to	1
change	1
her	1
name,	1
by	1
the	1
young	1
man,	1
who	1
not	1
long	1
afterwards	1
found	1
a	1
more	1
willing	1
mind	1
in	1
her	1
younger	1
sister;	1
and	1
Lady	1
Russell	1
had	1
lamented	1
her	1
refusal;	1
for	1
Charles	1
Musgrove	1
was	1
the	1
eldest	1
son	1
of	1
a	1
man,	1
whose	1
landed	1
property	1
and	1
general	1
importance	1
were	1
second	1
in	1
that	1
country,	1
only	1
to	1
Sir	1
Walter's,	1
and	1
of	1
good	1
character	1
and	1
appearance;	1
and	1
however	1
Lady	1
Russell	1
might	1
have	1
asked	1
yet	1
for	1
something	1
more,	1
while	1
Anne	1
was	1
nineteen,	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
rejoiced	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
at	1
twenty-two	1
so	1
respectably	1
removed	1
from	1
the	1
partialities	1
and	1
injustice	1
of	1
her	1
father's	1
house,	1
and	1
settled	1
so	1
permanently	1
near	1
herself.	1
But	1
in	1
this	1
case,	1
Anne	1
had	1
left	1
nothing	1
for	1
advice	1
to	1
do;	1
and	1
though	1
Lady	1
Russell,	1
as	1
satisfied	1
as	1
ever	1
with	1
her	1
own	1
discretion,	1
never	1
wished	1
the	1
past	1
undone,	1
she	1
began	1
now	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
anxiety	1
which	1
borders	1
on	1
hopelessness	1
for	1
Anne's	1
being	1
tempted,	1
by	1
some	1
man	1
of	1
talents	1
and	1
independence,	1
to	1
enter	1
a	1
state	1
for	1
which	1
she	1
held	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
peculiarly	1
fitted	1
by	1
her	1
warm	1
affections	1
and	1
domestic	1
habits.	1
They	1
knew	1
not	1
each	1
other's	1
opinion,	1
either	1
its	1
constancy	1
or	1
its	1
change,	1
on	1
the	1
one	1
leading	1
point	1
of	1
Anne's	1
conduct,	1
for	1
the	1
subject	1
was	1
never	1
alluded	1
to;	1
but	1
Anne,	1
at	1
seven-and-twenty,	1
thought	1
very	1
differently	1
from	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
made	1
to	1
think	1
at	1
nineteen.	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
blame	1
Lady	1
Russell,	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
blame	1
herself	1
for	1
having	1
been	1
guided	1
by	1
her;	1
but	1
she	1
felt	1
that	1
were	1
any	1
young	1
person,	1
in	1
similar	1
circumstances,	1
to	1
apply	1
to	1
her	1
for	1
counsel,	1
they	1
would	1
never	1
receive	1
any	1
of	1
such	1
certain	1
immediate	1
wretchedness,	1
such	1
uncertain	1
future	1
good.	1
She	1
was	1
persuaded	1
that	1
under	1
every	1
disadvantage	1
of	1
disapprobation	1
at	1
home,	1
and	1
every	1
anxiety	1
attending	1
his	1
profession,	1
all	1
their	1
probable	1
fears,	1
delays,	1
and	1
disappointments,	1
she	1
should	1
yet	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
happier	1
woman	1
in	1
maintaining	1
the	1
engagement,	1
than	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
it;	1
and	1
this,	1
she	1
fully	1
believed,	1
had	1
the	1
usual	1
share,	1
had	1
even	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
usual	1
share	1
of	1
all	1
such	1
solicitudes	1
and	1
suspense	1
been	1
theirs,	1
without	1
reference	1
to	1
the	1
actual	1
results	1
of	1
their	1
case,	1
which,	1
as	1
it	1
happened,	1
would	1
have	1
bestowed	1
earlier	1
prosperity	1
than	1
could	1
be	1
reasonably	1
calculated	1
on.	1
All	1
his	1
sanguine	1
expectations,	1
all	1
his	1
confidence	1
had	1
been	1
justified.	1
His	1
genius	1
and	1
ardour	1
had	1
seemed	1
to	1
foresee	1
and	1
to	1
command	1
his	1
prosperous	1
path.	1
He	1
had,	1
very	1
soon	1
after	1
their	1
engagement	1
ceased,	1
got	1
employ:	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
told	1
her	1
would	1
follow,	1
had	1
taken	1
place.	1
He	1
had	1
distinguished	1
himself,	1
and	1
early	1
gained	1
the	1
other	1
step	1
in	1
rank,	1
and	1
must	1
now,	1
by	1
successive	1
captures,	1
have	1
made	1
a	1
handsome	1
fortune.	1
She	1
had	1
only	1
navy	1
lists	1
and	1
newspapers	1
for	1
her	1
authority,	1
but	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
doubt	1
his	1
being	1
rich;	1
and,	1
in	1
favour	1
of	1
his	1
constancy,	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
reason	1
to	1
believe	1
him	1
married.	1
How	1
eloquent	1
could	1
Anne	1
Elliot	1
have	1
been!	1
how	1
eloquent,	1
at	1
least,	1
were	1
her	1
wishes	1
on	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
early	1
warm	1
attachment,	1
and	1
a	1
cheerful	1
confidence	1
in	1
futurity,	1
against	1
that	1
over-anxious	1
caution	1
which	1
seems	1
to	1
insult	1
exertion	1
and	1
distrust	1
Providence!	1
She	1
had	1
been	1
forced	1
into	1
prudence	1
in	1
her	1
youth,	1
she	1
learned	1
romance	1
as	1
she	1
grew	1
older:	1
the	1
natural	1
sequel	1
of	1
an	1
unnatural	1
beginning.	1
With	1
all	1
these	1
circumstances,	1
recollections	1
and	1
feelings,	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
hear	1
that	1
Captain	1
Wentworth's	1
sister	1
was	1
likely	1
to	1
live	1
at	1
Kellynch	1
without	1
a	1
revival	1
of	1
former	1
pain;	1
and	1
many	1
a	1
stroll,	1
and	1
many	1
a	1
sigh,	1
were	1
necessary	1
to	1
dispel	1
the	1
agitation	1
of	1
the	1
idea.	1
She	1
often	1
told	1
herself	1
it	1
was	1
folly,	1
before	1
she	1
could	1
harden	1
her	1
nerves	1
sufficiently	1
to	1
feel	1
the	1
continual	1
discussion	1
of	1
the	1
Crofts	1
and	1
their	1
business	1
no	1
evil.	1
She	1
was	1
assisted,	1
however,	1
by	1
that	1
perfect	1
indifference	1
and	1
apparent	1
unconsciousness,	1
among	1
the	1
only	1
three	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
friends	1
in	1
the	1
secret	1
of	1
the	1
past,	1
which	1
seemed	1
almost	1
to	1
deny	1
any	1
recollection	1
of	1
it.	1
She	1
could	1
do	1
justice	1
to	1
the	1
superiority	1
of	1
Lady	1
Russell's	1
motives	1
in	1
this,	1
over	1
those	1
of	1
her	1
father	1
and	1
Elizabeth;	1
she	1
could	1
honour	1
all	1
the	1
better	1
feelings	1
of	1
her	1
calmness;	1
but	1
the	1
general	1
air	1
of	1
oblivion	1
among	1
them	1
was	1
highly	1
important	1
from	1
whatever	1
it	1
sprung;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
event	1
of	1
Admiral	1
Croft's	1
really	1
taking	1
Kellynch	1
Hall,	1
she	1
rejoiced	1
anew	1
over	1
the	1
conviction	1
which	1
had	1
always	1
been	1
most	1
grateful	1
to	1
her,	1
of	1
the	1
past	1
being	1
known	1
to	1
those	1
three	1
only	1
among	1
her	1
connexions,	1
by	1
whom	1
no	1
syllable,	1
she	1
believed,	1
would	1
ever	1
be	1
whispered,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
trust	1
that	1
among	1
his,	1
the	1
brother	1
only	1
with	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
residing,	1
had	1
received	1
any	1
information	1
of	1
their	1
short-lived	1
engagement.	1
That	1
brother	1
had	1
been	1
long	1
removed	1
from	1
the	1
country	1
and	1
being	1
a	1
sensible	1
man,	1
and,	1
moreover,	1
a	1
single	1
man	1
at	1
the	1
time,	1
she	1
had	1
a	1
fond	1
dependence	1
on	1
no	1
human	1
creature's	1
having	1
heard	1
of	1
it	1
from	1
him.	1
The	1
sister,	1
Mrs	1
Croft,	1
had	1
then	1
been	1
out	1
of	1
England,	1
accompanying	1
her	1
husband	1
on	1
a	1
foreign	1
station,	1
and	1
her	1
own	1
sister,	1
Mary,	1
had	1
been	1
at	1
school	1
while	1
it	1
all	1
occurred;	1
and	1
never	1
admitted	1
by	1
the	1
pride	1
of	1
some,	1
and	1
the	1
delicacy	1
of	1
others,	1
to	1
the	1
smallest	1
knowledge	1
of	1
it	1
afterwards.	1
With	1
these	1
supports,	1
she	1
hoped	1
that	1
the	1
acquaintance	1
between	1
herself	1
and	1
the	1
Crofts,	1
which,	1
with	1
Lady	1
Russell,	1
still	1
resident	1
in	1
Kellynch,	1
and	1
Mary	1
fixed	1
only	1
three	1
miles	1
off,	1
must	1
be	1
anticipated,	1
need	1
not	1
involve	1
any	1
particular	1
awkwardness.	1
Chapter	1
5	1
On	1
the	1
morning	1
appointed	1
for	1
Admiral	1
and	1
Mrs	1
Croft's	1
seeing	1
Kellynch	1
Hall,	1
Anne	1
found	1
it	1
most	1
natural	1
to	1
take	1
her	1
almost	1
daily	1
walk	1
to	1
Lady	1
Russell's,	1
and	1
keep	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way	1
till	1
all	1
was	1
over;	1
when	1
she	1
found	1
it	1
most	1
natural	1
to	1
be	1
sorry	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
missed	1
the	1
opportunity	1
of	1
seeing	1
them.	1
This	1
meeting	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
parties	1
proved	1
highly	1
satisfactory,	1
and	1
decided	1
the	1
whole	1
business	1
at	1
once.	1
Each	1
lady	1
was	1
previously	1
well	1
disposed	1
for	1
an	1
agreement,	1
and	1
saw	1
nothing,	1
therefore,	1
but	1
good	1
manners	1
in	1
the	1
other;	1
and	1
with	1
regard	1
to	1
the	1
gentlemen,	1
there	1
was	1
such	1
an	1
hearty	1
good	1
humour,	1
such	1
an	1
open,	1
trusting	1
liberality	1
on	1
the	1
Admiral's	1
side,	1
as	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
influence	1
Sir	1
Walter,	1
who	1
had	1
besides	1
been	1
flattered	1
into	1
his	1
very	1
best	1
and	1
most	1
polished	1
behaviour	1
by	1
Mr	1
Shepherd's	1
assurances	1
of	1
his	1
being	1
known,	1
by	1
report,	1
to	1
the	1
Admiral,	1
as	1
a	1
model	1
of	1
good	1
breeding.	1
The	1
house	1
and	1
grounds,	1
and	1
furniture,	1
were	1
approved,	1
the	1
Crofts	1
were	1
approved,	1
terms,	1
time,	1
every	1
thing,	1
and	1
every	1
body,	1
was	1
right;	1
and	1
Mr	1
Shepherd's	1
clerks	1
were	1
set	1
to	1
work,	1
without	1
there	1
having	1
been	1
a	1
single	1
preliminary	1
difference	1
to	1
modify	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
"This	1
indenture	1
sheweth."	1
Sir	1
Walter,	1
without	1
hesitation,	1
declared	1
the	1
Admiral	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
best-looking	1
sailor	1
he	1
had	1
ever	1
met	1
with,	1
and	1
went	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
to	1
say,	1
that	1
if	1
his	1
own	1
man	1
might	1
have	1
had	1
the	1
arranging	1
of	1
his	1
hair,	1
he	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
ashamed	1
of	1
being	1
seen	1
with	1
him	1
any	1
where;	1
and	1
the	1
Admiral,	1
with	1
sympathetic	1
cordiality,	1
observed	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
as	1
they	1
drove	1
back	1
through	1
the	1
park,	1
"I	1
thought	1
we	1
should	1
soon	1
come	1
to	1
a	1
deal,	1
my	1
dear,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
what	1
they	1
told	1
us	1
at	1
Taunton.	1
The	1
Baronet	1
will	1
never	1
set	1
the	1
Thames	1
on	1
fire,	1
but	1
there	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
no	1
harm	1
in	1
him."	1
reciprocal	1
compliments,	1
which	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
esteemed	1
about	1
equal.	1
The	1
Crofts	1
were	1
to	1
have	1
possession	1
at	1
Michaelmas;	1
and	1
as	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
proposed	1
removing	1
to	1
Bath	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
the	1
preceding	1
month,	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
time	1
to	1
be	1
lost	1
in	1
making	1
every	1
dependent	1
arrangement.	1
Lady	1
Russell,	1
convinced	1
that	1
Anne	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
allowed	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
any	1
use,	1
or	1
any	1
importance,	1
in	1
the	1
choice	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
going	1
to	1
secure,	1
was	1
very	1
unwilling	1
to	1
have	1
her	1
hurried	1
away	1
so	1
soon,	1
and	1
wanted	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
possible	1
for	1
her	1
to	1
stay	1
behind	1
till	1
she	1
might	1
convey	1
her	1
to	1
Bath	1
herself	1
after	1
Christmas;	1
but	1
having	1
engagements	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
which	1
must	1
take	1
her	1
from	1
Kellynch	1
for	1
several	1
weeks,	1
she	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
full	1
invitation	1
she	1
wished,	1
and	1
Anne	1
though	1
dreading	1
the	1
possible	1
heats	1
of	1
September	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
white	1
glare	1
of	1
Bath,	1
and	1
grieving	1
to	1
forego	1
all	1
the	1
influence	1
so	1
sweet	1
and	1
so	1
sad	1
of	1
the	1
autumnal	1
months	1
in	1
the	1
country,	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
that,	1
everything	1
considered,	1
she	1
wished	1
to	1
remain.	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
most	1
right,	1
and	1
most	1
wise,	1
and,	1
therefore	1
must	1
involve	1
least	1
suffering	1
to	1
go	1
with	1
the	1
others.	1
Something	1
occurred,	1
however,	1
to	1
give	1
her	1
a	1
different	1
duty.	1
Mary,	1
often	1
a	1
little	1
unwell,	1
and	1
always	1
thinking	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
complaints,	1
and	1
always	1
in	1
the	1
habit	1
of	1
claiming	1
Anne	1
when	1
anything	1
was	1
the	1
matter,	1
was	1
indisposed;	1
and	1
foreseeing	1
that	1
she	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
a	1
day's	1
health	1
all	1
the	1
autumn,	1
entreated,	1
or	1
rather	1
required	1
her,	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
hardly	1
entreaty,	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
Uppercross	1
Cottage,	1
and	1
bear	1
her	1
company	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
she	1
should	1
want	1
her,	1
instead	1
of	1
going	1
to	1
Bath.	1
"I	1
cannot	1
possibly	1
do	1
without	1
Anne,"	1
was	1
Mary's	1
reasoning;	1
and	1
Elizabeth's	1
reply	1
was,	1
"Then	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
Anne	1
had	1
better	1
stay,	1
for	1
nobody	1
will	1
want	1
her	1
in	1
Bath."	1
To	1
be	1
claimed	1
as	1
a	1
good,	1
though	1
in	1
an	1
improper	1
style,	1
is	1
at	1
least	1
better	1
than	1
being	1
rejected	1
as	1
no	1
good	1
at	1
all;	1
and	1
Anne,	1
glad	1
to	1
be	1
thought	1
of	1
some	1
use,	1
glad	1
to	1
have	1
anything	1
marked	1
out	1
as	1
a	1
duty,	1
and	1
certainly	1
not	1
sorry	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
scene	1
of	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
country,	1
and	1
her	1
own	1
dear	1
country,	1
readily	1
agreed	1
to	1
stay.	1
This	1
invitation	1
of	1
Mary's	1
removed	1
all	1
Lady	1
Russell's	1
difficulties,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
consequently	1
soon	1
settled	1
that	1
Anne	1
should	1
not	1
go	1
to	1
Bath	1
till	1
Lady	1
Russell	1
took	1
her,	1
and	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
intervening	1
time	1
should	1
be	1
divided	1
between	1
Uppercross	1
Cottage	1
and	1
Kellynch	1
Lodge.	1
So	1
far	1
all	1
was	1
perfectly	1
right;	1
but	1
Lady	1
Russell	1
was	1
almost	1
startled	1
by	1
the	1
wrong	1
of	1
one	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
Kellynch	1
Hall	1
plan,	1
when	1
it	1
burst	1
on	1
her,	1
which	1
was,	1
Mrs	1
Clay's	1
being	1
engaged	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
Bath	1
with	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
and	1
Elizabeth,	1
as	1
a	1
most	1
important	1
and	1
valuable	1
assistant	1
to	1
the	1
latter	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
business	1
before	1
her.	1
Lady	1
Russell	1
was	1
extremely	1
sorry	1
that	1
such	1
a	1
measure	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
resorted	1
to	1
at	1
all,	1
wondered,	1
grieved,	1
and	1
feared;	1
and	1
the	1
affront	1
it	1
contained	1
to	1
Anne,	1
in	1
Mrs	1
Clay's	1
being	1
of	1
so	1
much	1
use,	1
while	1
Anne	1
could	1
be	1
of	1
none,	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
sore	1
aggravation.	1
Anne	1
herself	1
was	1
become	1
hardened	1
to	1
such	1
affronts;	1
but	1
she	1
felt	1
the	1
imprudence	1
of	1
the	1
arrangement	1
quite	1
as	1
keenly	1
as	1
Lady	1
Russell.	1
With	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
quiet	1
observation,	1
and	1
a	1
knowledge,	1
which	1
she	1
often	1
wished	1
less,	1
of	1
her	1
father's	1
character,	1
she	1
was	1
sensible	1
that	1
results	1
the	1
most	1
serious	1
to	1
his	1
family	1
from	1
the	1
intimacy	1
were	1
more	1
than	1
possible.	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
imagine	1
that	1
her	1
father	1
had	1
at	1
present	1
an	1
idea	1
of	1
the	1
kind.	1
Mrs	1
Clay	1
had	1
freckles,	1
and	1
a	1
projecting	1
tooth,	1
and	1
a	1
clumsy	1
wrist,	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
continually	1
making	1
severe	1
remarks	1
upon,	1
in	1
her	1
absence;	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
young,	1
and	1
certainly	1
altogether	1
well-looking,	1
and	1
possessed,	1
in	1
an	1
acute	1
mind	1
and	1
assiduous	1
pleasing	1
manners,	1
infinitely	1
more	1
dangerous	1
attractions	1
than	1
any	1
merely	1
personal	1
might	1
have	1
been.	1
Anne	1
was	1
so	1
impressed	1
by	1
the	1
degree	1
of	1
their	1
danger,	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
excuse	1
herself	1
from	1
trying	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
perceptible	1
to	1
her	1
sister.	1
She	1
had	1
little	1
hope	1
of	1
success;	1
but	1
Elizabeth,	1
who	1
in	1
the	1
event	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
reverse	1
would	1
be	1
so	1
much	1
more	1
to	1
be	1
pitied	1
than	1
herself,	1
should	1
never,	1
she	1
thought,	1
have	1
reason	1
to	1
reproach	1
her	1
for	1
giving	1
no	1
warning.	1
She	1
spoke,	1
and	1
seemed	1
only	1
to	1
offend.	1
Elizabeth	1
could	1
not	1
conceive	1
how	1
such	1
an	1
absurd	1
suspicion	1
should	1
occur	1
to	1
her,	1
and	1
indignantly	1
answered	1
for	1
each	1
party's	1
perfectly	1
knowing	1
their	1
situation.	1
"Mrs	1
Clay,"	1
said	1
she,	1
warmly,	1
"never	1
forgets	1
who	1
she	1
is;	1
and	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
rather	1
better	1
acquainted	1
with	1
her	1
sentiments	1
than	1
you	1
can	1
be,	1
I	1
can	1
assure	1
you,	1
that	1
upon	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
marriage	1
they	1
are	1
particularly	1
nice,	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
reprobates	1
all	1
inequality	1
of	1
condition	1
and	1
rank	1
more	1
strongly	1
than	1
most	1
people.	1
And	1
as	1
to	1
my	1
father,	1
I	1
really	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
thought	1
that	1
he,	1
who	1
has	1
kept	1
himself	1
single	1
so	1
long	1
for	1
our	1
sakes,	1
need	1
be	1
suspected	1
now.	1
If	1
Mrs	1
Clay	1
were	1
a	1
very	1
beautiful	1
woman,	1
I	1
grant	1
you,	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
wrong	1
to	1
have	1
her	1
so	1
much	1
with	1
me;	1
not	1
that	1
anything	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
I	1
am	1
sure,	1
would	1
induce	1
my	1
father	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
degrading	1
match,	1
but	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
rendered	1
unhappy.	1
But	1
poor	1
Mrs	1
Clay	1
who,	1
with	1
all	1
her	1
merits,	1
can	1
never	1
have	1
been	1
reckoned	1
tolerably	1
pretty,	1
I	1
really	1
think	1
poor	1
Mrs	1
Clay	1
may	1
be	1
staying	1
here	1
in	1
perfect	1
safety.	1
One	1
would	1
imagine	1
you	1
had	1
never	1
heard	1
my	1
father	1
speak	1
of	1
her	1
personal	1
misfortunes,	1
though	1
I	1
know	1
you	1
must	1
fifty	1
times.	1
That	1
tooth	1
of	1
her's	1
and	1
those	1
freckles.	1
Freckles	1
do	1
not	1
disgust	1
me	1
so	1
very	1
much	1
as	1
they	1
do	1
him.	1
I	1
have	1
known	1
a	1
face	1
not	1
materially	1
disfigured	1
by	1
a	1
few,	1
but	1
he	1
abominates	1
them.	1
You	1
must	1
have	1
heard	1
him	1
notice	1
Mrs	1
Clay's	1
freckles."	1
"There	1
is	1
hardly	1
any	1
personal	1
defect,"	1
replied	1
Anne,	1
"which	1
an	1
agreeable	1
manner	1
might	1
not	1
gradually	1
reconcile	1
one	1
to."	1
"I	1
think	1
very	1
differently,"	1
answered	1
Elizabeth,	1
shortly;	1
"an	1
agreeable	1
manner	1
may	1
set	1
off	1
handsome	1
features,	1
but	1
can	1
never	1
alter	1
plain	1
ones.	1
However,	1
at	1
any	1
rate,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
more	1
at	1
stake	1
on	1
this	1
point	1
than	1
anybody	1
else	1
can	1
have,	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
rather	1
unnecessary	1
in	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
advising	1
me."	1
Anne	1
had	1
done;	1
glad	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
over,	1
and	1
not	1
absolutely	1
hopeless	1
of	1
doing	1
good.	1
Elizabeth,	1
though	1
resenting	1
the	1
suspicion,	1
might	1
yet	1
be	1
made	1
observant	1
by	1
it.	1
The	1
last	1
office	1
of	1
the	1
four	1
carriage-horses	1
was	1
to	1
draw	1
Sir	1
Walter,	1
Miss	1
Elliot,	1
and	1
Mrs	1
Clay	1
to	1
Bath.	1
The	1
party	1
drove	1
off	1
in	1
very	1
good	1
spirits;	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
prepared	1
with	1
condescending	1
bows	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
afflicted	1
tenantry	1
and	1
cottagers	1
who	1
might	1
have	1
had	1
a	1
hint	1
to	1
show	1
themselves,	1
and	1
Anne	1
walked	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
in	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
desolate	1
tranquillity,	1
to	1
the	1
Lodge,	1
where	1
she	1
was	1
to	1
spend	1
the	1
first	1
week.	1
Her	1
friend	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
better	1
spirits	1
than	1
herself.	1
Lady	1
Russell	1
felt	1
this	1
break-up	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
exceedingly.	1
Their	1
respectability	1
was	1
as	1
dear	1
to	1
her	1
as	1
her	1
own,	1
and	1
a	1
daily	1
intercourse	1
had	1
become	1
precious	1
by	1
habit.	1
It	1
was	1
painful	1
to	1
look	1
upon	1
their	1
deserted	1
grounds,	1
and	1
still	1
worse	1
to	1
anticipate	1
the	1
new	1
hands	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
fall	1
into;	1
and	1
to	1
escape	1
the	1
solitariness	1
and	1
the	1
melancholy	1
of	1
so	1
altered	1
a	1
village,	1
and	1
be	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way	1
when	1
Admiral	1
and	1
Mrs	1
Croft	1
first	1
arrived,	1
she	1
had	1
determined	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
own	1
absence	1
from	1
home	1
begin	1
when	1
she	1
must	1
give	1
up	1
Anne.	1
Accordingly	1
their	1
removal	1
was	1
made	1
together,	1
and	1
Anne	1
was	1
set	1
down	1
at	1
Uppercross	1
Cottage,	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
stage	1
of	1
Lady	1
Russell's	1
journey.	1
Uppercross	1
was	1
a	1
moderate-sized	1
village,	1
which	1
a	1
few	1
years	1
back	1
had	1
been	1
completely	1
in	1
the	1
old	1
English	1
style,	1
containing	1
only	1
two	1
houses	1
superior	1
in	1
appearance	1
to	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
yeomen	1
and	1
labourers;	1
the	1
mansion	1
of	1
the	1
squire,	1
with	1
its	1
high	1
walls,	1
great	1
gates,	1
and	1
old	1
trees,	1
substantial	1
and	1
unmodernized,	1
and	1
the	1
compact,	1
tight	1
parsonage,	1
enclosed	1
in	1
its	1
own	1
neat	1
garden,	1
with	1
a	1
vine	1
and	1
a	1
pear-tree	1
trained	1
round	1
its	1
casements;	1
but	1
upon	1
the	1
marriage	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
'squire,	1
it	1
had	1
received	1
the	1
improvement	1
of	1
a	1
farm-house	1
elevated	1
into	1
a	1
cottage,	1
for	1
his	1
residence,	1
and	1
Uppercross	1
Cottage,	1
with	1
its	1
veranda,	1
French	1
windows,	1
and	1
other	1
prettiness,	1
was	1
quite	1
as	1
likely	1
to	1
catch	1
the	1
traveller's	1
eye	1
as	1
the	1
more	1
consistent	1
and	1
considerable	1
aspect	1
and	1
premises	1
of	1
the	1
Great	1
House,	1
about	1
a	1
quarter	1
of	1
a	1
mile	1
farther	1
on.	1
Here	1
Anne	1
had	1
often	1
been	1
staying.	1
She	1
knew	1
the	1
ways	1
of	1
Uppercross	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
those	1
of	1
Kellynch.	1
The	1
two	1
families	1
were	1
so	1
continually	1
meeting,	1
so	1
much	1
in	1
the	1
habit	1
of	1
running	1
in	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
each	1
other's	1
house	1
at	1
all	1
hours,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
rather	1
a	1
surprise	1
to	1
her	1
to	1
find	1
Mary	1
alone;	1
but	1
being	1
alone,	1
her	1
being	1
unwell	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
spirits	1
was	1
almost	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
course.	1
Though	1
better	1
endowed	1
than	1
the	1
elder	1
sister,	1
Mary	1
had	1
not	1
Anne's	1
understanding	1
nor	1
temper.	1
While	1
well,	1
and	1
happy,	1
and	1
properly	1
attended	1
to,	1
she	1
had	1
great	1
good	1
humour	1
and	1
excellent	1
spirits;	1
but	1
any	1
indisposition	1
sunk	1
her	1
completely.	1
She	1
had	1
no	1
resources	1
for	1
solitude;	1
and	1
inheriting	1
a	1
considerable	1
share	1
of	1
the	1
Elliot	1
self-importance,	1
was	1
very	1
prone	1
to	1
add	1
to	1
every	1
other	1
distress	1
that	1
of	1
fancying	1
herself	1
neglected	1
and	1
ill-used.	1
In	1
person,	1
she	1
was	1
inferior	1
to	1
both	1
sisters,	1
and	1
had,	1
even	1
in	1
her	1
bloom,	1
only	1
reached	1
the	1
dignity	1
of	1
being	1
"a	1
fine	1
girl."	1
She	1
was	1
now	1
lying	1
on	1
the	1
faded	1
sofa	1
of	1
the	1
pretty	1
little	1
drawing-room,	1
the	1
once	1
elegant	1
furniture	1
of	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
gradually	1
growing	1
shabby,	1
under	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
four	1
summers	1
and	1
two	1
children;	1
and,	1
on	1
Anne's	1
appearing,	1
greeted	1
her	1
with--	1
"So,	1
you	1
are	1
come	1
at	1
last!	1
I	1
began	1
to	1
think	1
I	1
should	1
never	1
see	1
you.	1
I	1
am	1
so	1
ill	1
I	1
can	1
hardly	1
speak.	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
seen	1
a	1
creature	1
the	1
whole	1
morning!"	1
"I	1
am	1
sorry	1
to	1
find	1
you	1
unwell,"	1
replied	1
Anne.	1
"You	1
sent	1
me	1
such	1
a	1
good	1
account	1
of	1
yourself	1
on	1
Thursday!"	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
made	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
it;	1
I	1
always	1
do:	1
but	1
I	1
was	1
very	1
far	1
from	1
well	1
at	1
the	1
time;	1
and	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
I	1
ever	1
was	1
so	1
ill	1
in	1
my	1
life	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
all	1
this	1
morning:	1
very	1
unfit	1
to	1
be	1
left	1
alone,	1
I	1
am	1
sure.	1
Suppose	1
I	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
seized	1
of	1
a	1
sudden	1
in	1
some	1
dreadful	1
way,	1
and	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
ring	1
the	1
bell!	1
So,	1
Lady	1
Russell	1
would	1
not	1
get	1
out.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
she	1
has	1
been	1
in	1
this	1
house	1
three	1
times	1
this	1
summer."	1
Anne	1
said	1
what	1
was	1
proper,	1
and	1
enquired	1
after	1
her	1
husband.	1
"Oh!	1
Charles	1
is	1
out	1
shooting.	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
seen	1
him	1
since	1
seven	1
o'clock.	1
He	1
would	1
go,	1
though	1
I	1
told	1
him	1
how	1
ill	1
I	1
was.	1
He	1
said	1
he	1
should	1
not	1
stay	1
out	1
long;	1
but	1
he	1
has	1
never	1
come	1
back,	1
and	1
now	1
it	1
is	1
almost	1
one.	1
I	1
assure	1
you,	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
seen	1
a	1
soul	1
this	1
whole	1
long	1
morning."	1
"You	1
have	1
had	1
your	1
little	1
boys	1
with	1
you?"	1
"Yes,	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
I	1
could	1
bear	1
their	1
noise;	1
but	1
they	1
are	1
so	1
unmanageable	1
that	1
they	1
do	1
me	1
more	1
harm	1
than	1
good.	1
Little	1
Charles	1
does	1
not	1
mind	1
a	1
word	1
I	1
say,	1
and	1
Walter	1
is	1
growing	1
quite	1
as	1
bad."	1
"Well,	1
you	1
will	1
soon	1
be	1
better	1
now,"	1
replied	1
Anne,	1
cheerfully.	1
"You	1
know	1
I	1
always	1
cure	1
you	1
when	1
I	1
come.	1
How	1
are	1
your	1
neighbours	1
at	1
the	1
Great	1
House?"	1
"I	1
can	1
give	1
you	1
no	1
account	1
of	1
them.	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
seen	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
to-day,	1
except	1
Mr	1
Musgrove,	1
who	1
just	1
stopped	1
and	1
spoke	1
through	1
the	1
window,	1
but	1
without	1
getting	1
off	1
his	1
horse;	1
and	1
though	1
I	1
told	1
him	1
how	1
ill	1
I	1
was,	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
have	1
been	1
near	1
me.	1
It	1
did	1
not	1
happen	1
to	1
suit	1
the	1
Miss	1
Musgroves,	1
I	1
suppose,	1
and	1
they	1
never	1
put	1
themselves	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
way."	1
"You	1
will	1
see	1
them	1
yet,	1
perhaps,	1
before	1
the	1
morning	1
is	1
gone.	1
It	1
is	1
early."	1
"I	1
never	1
want	1
them,	1
I	1
assure	1
you.	1
They	1
talk	1
and	1
laugh	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
too	1
much	1
for	1
me.	1
Oh!	1
Anne,	1
I	1
am	1
so	1
very	1
unwell!	1
It	1
was	1
quite	1
unkind	1
of	1
you	1
not	1
to	1
come	1
on	1
Thursday."	1
"My	1
dear	1
Mary,	1
recollect	1
what	1
a	1
comfortable	1
account	1
you	1
sent	1
me	1
of	1
yourself!	1
You	1
wrote	1
in	1
the	1
cheerfullest	1
manner,	1
and	1
said	1
you	1
were	1
perfectly	1
well,	1
and	1
in	1
no	1
hurry	1
for	1
me;	1
and	1
that	1
being	1
the	1
case,	1
you	1
must	1
be	1
aware	1
that	1
my	1
wish	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
remain	1
with	1
Lady	1
Russell	1
to	1
the	1
last:	1
and	1
besides	1
what	1
I	1
felt	1
on	1
her	1
account,	1
I	1
have	1
really	1
been	1
so	1
busy,	1
have	1
had	1
so	1
much	1
to	1
do,	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
very	1
conveniently	1
have	1
left	1
Kellynch	1
sooner."	1
"Dear	1
me!	1
what	1
can	1
you	1
possibly	1
have	1
to	1
do?"	1
"A	1
great	1
many	1
things,	1
I	1
assure	1
you.	1
More	1
than	1
I	1
can	1
recollect	1
in	1
a	1
moment;	1
but	1
I	1
can	1
tell	1
you	1
some.	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
making	1
a	1
duplicate	1
of	1
the	1
catalogue	1
of	1
my	1
father's	1
books	1
and	1
pictures.	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
several	1
times	1
in	1
the	1
garden	1
with	1
Mackenzie,	1
trying	1
to	1
understand,	1
and	1
make	1
him	1
understand,	1
which	1
of	1
Elizabeth's	1
plants	1
are	1
for	1
Lady	1
Russell.	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
all	1
my	1
own	1
little	1
concerns	1
to	1
arrange,	1
books	1
and	1
music	1
to	1
divide,	1
and	1
all	1
my	1
trunks	1
to	1
repack,	1
from	1
not	1
having	1
understood	1
in	1
time	1
what	1
was	1
intended	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
waggons:	1
and	1
one	1
thing	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
to	1
do,	1
Mary,	1
of	1
a	1
more	1
trying	1
nature:	1
going	1
to	1
almost	1
every	1
house	1
in	1
the	1
parish,	1
as	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
take-leave.	1
I	1
was	1
told	1
that	1
they	1
wished	1
it.	1
But	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
took	1
up	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
time."	1
"Oh!	1
well!"	1
and	1
after	1
a	1
moment's	1
pause,	1
"but	1
you	1
have	1
never	1
asked	1
me	1
one	1
word	1
about	1
our	1
dinner	1
at	1
the	1
Pooles	1
yesterday."	1
"Did	1
you	1
go	1
then?	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
no	1
enquiries,	1
because	1
I	1
concluded	1
you	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
obliged	1
to	1
give	1
up	1
the	1
party."	1
"Oh	1
yes!	1
I	1
went.	1
I	1
was	1
very	1
well	1
yesterday;	1
nothing	1
at	1
all	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
me	1
till	1
this	1
morning.	1
It	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
strange	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
gone."	1
"I	1
am	1
very	1
glad	1
you	1
were	1
well	1
enough,	1
and	1
I	1
hope	1
you	1
had	1
a	1
pleasant	1
party."	1
"Nothing	1
remarkable.	1
One	1
always	1
knows	1
beforehand	1
what	1
the	1
dinner	1
will	1
be,	1
and	1
who	1
will	1
be	1
there;	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
so	1
very	1
uncomfortable	1
not	1
having	1
a	1
carriage	1
of	1
one's	1
own.	1
Mr	1
and	1
Mrs	1
Musgrove	1
took	1
me,	1
and	1
we	1
were	1
so	1
crowded!	1
They	1
are	1
both	1
so	1
very	1
large,	1
and	1
take	1
up	1
so	1
much	1
room;	1
and	1
Mr	1
Musgrove	1
always	1
sits	1
forward.	1
So,	1
there	1
was	1
I,	1
crowded	1
into	1
the	1
back	1
seat	1
with	1
Henrietta	1
and	1
Louise;	1
and	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
very	1
likely	1
that	1
my	1
illness	1
to-day	1
may	1
be	1
owing	1
to	1
it."	1
A	1
little	1
further	1
perseverance	1
in	1
patience	1
and	1
forced	1
cheerfulness	1
on	1
Anne's	1
side	1
produced	1
nearly	1
a	1
cure	1
on	1
Mary's.	1
She	1
could	1
soon	1
sit	1
upright	1
on	1
the	1
sofa,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
hope	1
she	1
might	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
leave	1
it	1
by	1
dinner-time.	1
Then,	1
forgetting	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
it,	1
she	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
room,	1
beautifying	1
a	1
nosegay;	1
then,	1
she	1
ate	1
her	1
cold	1
meat;	1
and	1
then	1
she	1
was	1
well	1
enough	1
to	1
propose	1
a	1
little	1
walk.	1
"Where	1
shall	1
we	1
go?"	1
said	1
she,	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
ready.	1
"I	1
suppose	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
like	1
to	1
call	1
at	1
the	1
Great	1
House	1
before	1
they	1
have	1
been	1
to	1
see	1
you?"	1
"I	1
have	1
not	1
the	1
smallest	1
objection	1
on	1
that	1
account,"	1
replied	1
Anne.	1
"I	1
should	1
never	1
think	1
of	1
standing	1
on	1
such	1
ceremony	1
with	1
people	1
I	1
know	1
so	1
well	1
as	1
Mrs	1
and	1
the	1
Miss	1
Musgroves."	1
"Oh!	1
but	1
they	1
ought	1
to	1
call	1
upon	1
you	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
possible.	1
They	1
ought	1
to	1
feel	1
what	1
is	1
due	1
to	1
you	1
as	1
my	1
sister.	1
However,	1
we	1
may	1
as	1
well	1
go	1
and	1
sit	1
with	1
them	1
a	1
little	1
while,	1
and	1
when	1
we	1
have	1
that	1
over,	1
we	1
can	1
enjoy	1
our	1
walk."	1
Anne	1
had	1
always	1
thought	1
such	1
a	1
style	1
of	1
intercourse	1
highly	1
imprudent;	1
but	1
she	1
had	1
ceased	1
to	1
endeavour	1
to	1
check	1
it,	1
from	1
believing	1
that,	1
though	1
there	1
were	1
on	1
each	1
side	1
continual	1
subjects	1
of	1
offence,	1
neither	1
family	1
could	1
now	1
do	1
without	1
it.	1
To	1
the	1
Great	1
House	1
accordingly	1
they	1
went,	1
to	1
sit	1
the	1
full	1
half	1
hour	1
in	1
the	1
old-fashioned	1
square	1
parlour,	1
with	1
a	1
small	1
carpet	1
and	1
shining	1
floor,	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
present	1
daughters	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
were	1
gradually	1
giving	1
the	1
proper	1
air	1
of	1
confusion	1
by	1
a	1
grand	1
piano-forte	1
and	1
a	1
harp,	1
flower-stands	1
and	1
little	1
tables	1
placed	1
in	1
every	1
direction.	1
Oh!	1
could	1
the	1
originals	1
of	1
the	1
portraits	1
against	1
the	1
wainscot,	1
could	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
in	1
brown	1
velvet	1
and	1
the	1
ladies	1
in	1
blue	1
satin	1
have	1
seen	1
what	1
was	1
going	1
on,	1
have	1
been	1
conscious	1
of	1
such	1
an	1
overthrow	1
of	1
all	1
order	1
and	1
neatness!	1
The	1
portraits	1
themselves	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
staring	1
in	1
astonishment.	1
The	1
Musgroves,	1
like	1
their	1
houses,	1
were	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
alteration,	1
perhaps	1
of	1
improvement.	1
The	1
father	1
and	1
mother	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
old	1
English	1
style,	1
and	1
the	1
young	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
new.	1
Mr	1
and	1
Mrs	1
Musgrove	1
were	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
sort	1
of	1
people;	1
friendly	1
and	1
hospitable,	1
not	1
much	1
educated,	1
and	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
elegant.	1
Their	1
children	1
had	1
more	1
modern	1
minds	1
and	1
manners.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
numerous	1
family;	1
but	1
the	1
only	1
two	1
grown	1
up,	1
excepting	1
Charles,	1
were	1
Henrietta	1
and	1
Louisa,	1
young	1
ladies	1
of	1
nineteen	1
and	1
twenty,	1
who	1
had	1
brought	1
from	1
school	1
at	1
Exeter	1
all	1
the	1
usual	1
stock	1
of	1
accomplishments,	1
and	1
were	1
now	1
like	1
thousands	1
of	1
other	1
young	1
ladies,	1
living	1
to	1
be	1
fashionable,	1
happy,	1
and	1
merry.	1
Their	1
dress	1
had	1
every	1
advantage,	1
their	1
faces	1
were	1
rather	1
pretty,	1
their	1
spirits	1
extremely	1
good,	1
their	1
manner	1
unembarrassed	1
and	1
pleasant;	1
they	1
were	1
of	1
consequence	1
at	1
home,	1
and	1
favourites	1
abroad.	1
Anne	1
always	1
contemplated	1
them	1
as	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
happiest	1
creatures	1
of	1
her	1
acquaintance;	1
but	1
still,	1
saved	1
as	1
we	1
all	1
are,	1
by	1
some	1
comfortable	1
feeling	1
of	1
superiority	1
from	1
wishing	1
for	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
exchange,	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
given	1
up	1
her	1
own	1
more	1
elegant	1
and	1
cultivated	1
mind	1
for	1
all	1
their	1
enjoyments;	1
and	1
envied	1
them	1
nothing	1
but	1
that	1
seemingly	1
perfect	1
good	1
understanding	1
and	1
agreement	1
together,	1
that	1
good-humoured	1
mutual	1
affection,	1
of	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
known	1
so	1
little	1
herself	1
with	1
either	1
of	1
her	1
sisters.	1
They	1
were	1
received	1
with	1
great	1
cordiality.	1
Nothing	1
seemed	1
amiss	1
on	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
Great	1
House	1
family,	1
which	1
was	1
generally,	1
as	1
Anne	1
very	1
well	1
knew,	1
the	1
least	1
to	1
blame.	1
The	1
half	1
hour	1
was	1
chatted	1
away	1
pleasantly	1
enough;	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
surprised	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
it,	1
to	1
have	1
their	1
walking	1
party	1
joined	1
by	1
both	1
the	1
Miss	1
Musgroves,	1
at	1
Mary's	1
particular	1
invitation.	1
Chapter	1
6	1
Anne	1
had	1
not	1
wanted	1
this	1
visit	1
to	1
Uppercross,	1
to	1
learn	1
that	1
a	1
removal	1
from	1
one	1
set	1
of	1
people	1
to	1
another,	1
though	1
at	1
a	1
distance	1
of	1
only	1
three	1
miles,	1
will	1
often	1
include	1
a	1
total	1
change	1
of	1
conversation,	1
opinion,	1
and	1
idea.	1
She	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
staying	1
there	1
before,	1
without	1
being	1
struck	1
by	1
it,	1
or	1
without	1
wishing	1
that	1
other	1
Elliots	1
could	1
have	1
her	1
advantage	1
in	1
seeing	1
how	1
unknown,	1
or	1
unconsidered	1
there,	1
were	1
the	1
affairs	1
which	1
at	1
Kellynch	1
Hall	1
were	1
treated	1
as	1
of	1
such	1
general	1
publicity	1
and	1
pervading	1
interest;	1
yet,	1
with	1
all	1
this	1
experience,	1
she	1
believed	1
she	1
must	1
now	1
submit	1
to	1
feel	1
that	1
another	1
lesson,	1
in	1
the	1
art	1
of	1
knowing	1
our	1
own	1
nothingness	1
beyond	1
our	1
own	1
circle,	1
was	1
become	1
necessary	1
for	1
her;	1
for	1
certainly,	1
coming	1
as	1
she	1
did,	1
with	1
a	1
heart	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
subject	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
completely	1
occupying	1
both	1
houses	1
in	1
Kellynch	1
for	1
many	1
weeks,	1
she	1
had	1
expected	1
rather	1
more	1
curiosity	1
and	1
sympathy	1
than	1
she	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
separate	1
but	1
very	1
similar	1
remark	1
of	1
Mr	1
and	1
Mrs	1
Musgrove:	1
"So,	1
Miss	1
Anne,	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
and	1
your	1
sister	1
are	1
gone;	1
and	1
what	1
part	1
of	1
Bath	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
they	1
will	1
settle	1
in?"	1
and	1
this,	1
without	1
much	1
waiting	1
for	1
an	1
answer;	1
or	1
in	1
the	1
young	1
ladies'	1
addition	1
of,	1
"I	1
hope	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
Bath	1
in	1
the	1
winter;	1
but	1
remember,	1
papa,	1
if	1
we	1
do	1
go,	1
we	1
must	1
be	1
in	1
a	1
good	1
situation:	1
none	1
of	1
your	1
Queen	1
Squares	1
for	1
us!"	1
or	1
in	1
the	1
anxious	1
supplement	1
from	1
Mary,	1
of--	1
"Upon	1
my	1
word,	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
pretty	1
well	1
off,	1
when	1
you	1
are	1
all	1
gone	1
away	1
to	1
be	1
happy	1
at	1
Bath!"	1
She	1
could	1
only	1
resolve	1
to	1
avoid	1
such	1
self-delusion	1
in	1
future,	1
and	1
think	1
with	1
heightened	1
gratitude	1
of	1
the	1
extraordinary	1
blessing	1
of	1
having	1
one	1
such	1
truly	1
sympathising	1
friend	1
as	1
Lady	1
Russell.	1
The	1
Mr	1
Musgroves	1
had	1
their	1
own	1
game	1
to	1
guard,	1
and	1
to	1
destroy,	1
their	1
own	1
horses,	1
dogs,	1
and	1
newspapers	1
to	1
engage	1
them,	1
and	1
the	1
females	1
were	1
fully	1
occupied	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
other	1
common	1
subjects	1
of	1
housekeeping,	1
neighbours,	1
dress,	1
dancing,	1
and	1
music.	1
She	1
acknowledged	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
very	1
fitting,	1
that	1
every	1
little	1
social	1
commonwealth	1
should	1
dictate	1
its	1
own	1
matters	1
of	1
discourse;	1
and	1
hoped,	1
ere	1
long,	1
to	1
become	1
a	1
not	1
unworthy	1
member	1
of	1
the	1
one	1
she	1
was	1
now	1
transplanted	1
into.	1
With	1
the	1
prospect	1
of	1
spending	1
at	1
least	1
two	1
months	1
at	1
Uppercross,	1
it	1
was	1
highly	1
incumbent	1
on	1
her	1
to	1
clothe	1
her	1
imagination,	1
her	1
memory,	1
and	1
all	1
her	1
ideas	1
in	1
as	1
much	1
of	1
Uppercross	1
as	1
possible.	1
She	1
had	1
no	1
dread	1
of	1
these	1
two	1
months.	1
Mary	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
repulsive	1
and	1
unsisterly	1
as	1
Elizabeth,	1
nor	1
so	1
inaccessible	1
to	1
all	1
influence	1
of	1
hers;	1
neither	1
was	1
there	1
anything	1
among	1
the	1
other	1
component	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
cottage	1
inimical	1
to	1
comfort.	1
She	1
was	1
always	1
on	1
friendly	1
terms	1
with	1
her	1
brother-in-law;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
children,	1
who	1
loved	1
her	1
nearly	1
as	1
well,	1
and	1
respected	1
her	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
more	1
than	1
their	1
mother,	1
she	1
had	1
an	1
object	1
of	1
interest,	1
amusement,	1
and	1
wholesome	1
exertion.	1
Charles	1
Musgrove	1
was	1
civil	1
and	1
agreeable;	1
in	1
sense	1
and	1
temper	1
he	1
was	1
undoubtedly	1
superior	1
to	1
his	1
wife,	1
but	1
not	1
of	1
powers,	1
or	1
conversation,	1
or	1
grace,	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
past,	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
connected	1
together,	1
at	1
all	1
a	1
dangerous	1
contemplation;	1
though,	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
Anne	1
could	1
believe,	1
with	1
Lady	1
Russell,	1
that	1
a	1
more	1
equal	1
match	1
might	1
have	1
greatly	1
improved	1
him;	1
and	1
that	1
a	1
woman	1
of	1
real	1
understanding	1
might	1
have	1
given	1
more	1
consequence	1
to	1
his	1
character,	1
and	1
more	1
usefulness,	1
rationality,	1
and	1
elegance	1
to	1
his	1
habits	1
and	1
pursuits.	1
As	1
it	1
was,	1
he	1
did	1
nothing	1
with	1
much	1
zeal,	1
but	1
sport;	1
and	1
his	1
time	1
was	1
otherwise	1
trifled	1
away,	1
without	1
benefit	1
from	1
books	1
or	1
anything	1
else.	1
He	1
had	1
very	1
good	1
spirits,	1
which	1
never	1
seemed	1
much	1
affected	1
by	1
his	1
wife's	1
occasional	1
lowness,	1
bore	1
with	1
her	1
unreasonableness	1
sometimes	1
to	1
Anne's	1
admiration,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
whole,	1
though	1
there	1
was	1
very	1
often	1
a	1
little	1
disagreement	1
(in	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
sometimes	1
more	1
share	1
than	1
she	1
wished,	1
being	1
appealed	1
to	1
by	1
both	1
parties),	1
they	1
might	1
pass	1
for	1
a	1
happy	1
couple.	1
They	1
were	1
always	1
perfectly	1
agreed	1
in	1
the	1
want	1
of	1
more	1
money,	1
and	1
a	1
strong	1
inclination	1
for	1
a	1
handsome	1
present	1
from	1
his	1
father;	1
but	1
here,	1
as	1
on	1
most	1
topics,	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
superiority,	1
for	1
while	1
Mary	1
thought	1
it	1
a	1
great	1
shame	1
that	1
such	1
a	1
present	1
was	1
not	1
made,	1
he	1
always	1
contended	1
for	1
his	1
father's	1
having	1
many	1
other	1
uses	1
for	1
his	1
money,	1
and	1
a	1
right	1
to	1
spend	1
it	1
as	1
he	1
liked.	1
As	1
to	1
the	1
management	1
of	1
their	1
children,	1
his	1
theory	1
was	1
much	1
better	1
than	1
his	1
wife's,	1
and	1
his	1
practice	1
not	1
so	1
bad.	1
"I	1
could	1
manage	1
them	1
very	1
well,	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
not	1
for	1
Mary's	1
interference,"	1
was	1
what	1
Anne	1
often	1
heard	1
him	1
say,	1
and	1
had	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
of	1
faith	1
in;	1
but	1
when	1
listening	1
in	1
turn	1
to	1
Mary's	1
reproach	1
of	1
"Charles	1
spoils	1
the	1
children	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
cannot	1
get	1
them	1
into	1
any	1
order,"	1
she	1
never	1
had	1
the	1
smallest	1
temptation	1
to	1
say,	1
"Very	1
true."	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
least	1
agreeable	1
circumstances	1
of	1
her	1
residence	1
there	1
was	1
her	1
being	1
treated	1
with	1
too	1
much	1
confidence	1
by	1
all	1
parties,	1
and	1
being	1
too	1
much	1
in	1
the	1
secret	1
of	1
the	1
complaints	1
of	1
each	1
house.	1
Known	1
to	1
have	1
some	1
influence	1
with	1
her	1
sister,	1
she	1
was	1
continually	1
requested,	1
or	1
at	1
least	1
receiving	1
hints	1
to	1
exert	1
it,	1
beyond	1
what	1
was	1
practicable.	1
"I	1
wish	1
you	1
could	1
persuade	1
Mary	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
always	1
fancying	1
herself	1
ill,"	1
was	1
Charles's	1
language;	1
and,	1
in	1
an	1
unhappy	1
mood,	1
thus	1
spoke	1
Mary:	1
"I	1
do	1
believe	1
if	1
Charles	1
were	1
to	1
see	1
me	1
dying,	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
think	1
there	1
was	1
anything	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
me.	1
I	1
am	1
sure,	1
Anne,	1
if	1
you	1
would,	1
you	1
might	1
persuade	1
him	1
that	1
I	1
really	1
am	1
very	1
ill--a	1
great	1
deal	1
worse	1
than	1
I	1
ever	1
own."	1
Mary's	1
declaration	1
was,	1
"I	1
hate	1
sending	1
the	1
children	1
to	1
the	1
Great	1
House,	1
though	1
their	1
grandmamma	1
is	1
always	1
wanting	1
to	1
see	1
them,	1
for	1
she	1
humours	1
and	1
indulges	1
them	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
degree,	1
and	1
gives	1
them	1
so	1
much	1
trash	1
and	1
sweet	1
things,	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
sure	1
to	1
come	1
back	1
sick	1
and	1
cross	1
for	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
day."	1
And	1
Mrs	1
Musgrove	1
took	1
the	1
first	1
opportunity	1
of	1
being	1
alone	1
with	1
Anne,	1
to	1
say,	1
"Oh!	1
Miss	1
Anne,	1
I	1
cannot	1
help	1
wishing	1
Mrs	1
Charles	1
had	1
a	1
little	1
of	1
your	1
method	1
with	1
those	1
children.	1
They	1
are	1
quite	1
different	1
creatures	1
with	1
you!	1
But	1
to	1
be	1
sure,	1
in	1
general	1
they	1
are	1
so	1
spoilt!	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
pity	1
you	1
cannot	1
put	1
your	1
sister	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
managing	1
them.	1
They	1
are	1
as	1
fine	1
healthy	1
children	1
as	1
ever	1
were	1
seen,	1
poor	1
little	1
dears!	1
without	1
partiality;	1
but	1
Mrs	1
Charles	1
knows	1
no	1
more	1
how	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
treated--!	1
Bless	1
me!	1
how	1
troublesome	1
they	1
are	1
sometimes.	1
I	1
assure	1
you,	1
Miss	1
Anne,	1
it	1
prevents	1
my	1
wishing	1
to	1
see	1
them	1
at	1
our	1
house	1
so	1
often	1
as	1
I	1
otherwise	1
should.	1
I	1
believe	1
Mrs	1
Charles	1
is	1
not	1
quite	1
pleased	1
with	1
my	1
not	1
inviting	1
them	1
oftener;	1
but	1
you	1
know	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
bad	1
to	1
have	1
children	1
with	1
one	1
that	1
one	1
is	1
obligated	1
to	1
be	1
checking	1
every	1
moment;	1
"don't	1
do	1
this,"	1
and	1
"don't	1
do	1
that;"	1
or	1
that	1
one	1
can	1
only	1
keep	1
in	1
tolerable	1
order	1
by	1
more	1
cake	1
than	1
is	1
good	1
for	1
them."	1
She	1
had	1
this	1
communication,	1
moreover,	1
from	1
Mary.	1
"Mrs	1
Musgrove	1
thinks	1
all	1
her	1
servants	1
so	1
steady,	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
high	1
treason	1
to	1
call	1
it	1
in	1
question;	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
sure,	1
without	1
exaggeration,	1
that	1
her	1
upper	1
house-maid	1
and	1
laundry-maid,	1
instead	1
of	1
being	1
in	1
their	1
business,	1
are	1
gadding	1
about	1
the	1
village,	1
all	1
day	1
long.	1
I	1
meet	1
them	1
wherever	1
I	1
go;	1
and	1
I	1
declare,	1
I	1
never	1
go	1
twice	1
into	1
my	1
nursery	1
without	1
seeing	1
something	1
of	1
them.	1
If	1
Jemima	1
were	1
not	1
the	1
trustiest,	1
steadiest	1
creature	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
enough	1
to	1
spoil	1
her;	1
for	1
she	1
tells	1
me,	1
they	1
are	1
always	1
tempting	1
her	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
walk	1
with	1
them."	1
And	1
on	1
Mrs	1
Musgrove's	1
side,	1
it	1
was,	1
"I	1
make	1
a	1
rule	1
of	1
never	1
interfering	1
in	1
any	1
of	1
my	1
daughter-in-law's	1
concerns,	1
for	1
I	1
know	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
do;	1
but	1
I	1
shall	1
tell	1
you,	1
Miss	1
Anne,	1
because	1
you	1
may	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
set	1
things	1
to	1
rights,	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
very	1
good	1
opinion	1
of	1
Mrs	1
Charles's	1
nursery-maid:	1
I	1
hear	1
strange	1
stories	1
of	1
her;	1
she	1
is	1
always	1
upon	1
the	1
gad;	1
and	1
from	1
my	1
own	1
knowledge,	1
I	1
can	1
declare,	1
she	1
is	1
such	1
a	1
fine-dressing	1
lady,	1
that	1
she	1
is	1
enough	1
to	1
ruin	1
any	1
servants	1
she	1
comes	1
near.	1
Mrs	1
Charles	1
quite	1
swears	1
by	1
her,	1
I	1
know;	1
but	1
I	1
just	1
give	1
you	1
this	1
hint,	1
that	1
you	1
may	1
be	1
upon	1
the	1
watch;	1
because,	1
if	1
you	1
see	1
anything	1
amiss,	1
you	1
need	1
not	1
be	1
afraid	1
of	1
mentioning	1
it."	1
Again,	1
it	1
was	1
Mary's	1
complaint,	1
that	1
Mrs	1
Musgrove	1
was	1
very	1
apt	1
not	1
to	1
give	1
her	1
the	1
precedence	1
that	1
was	1
her	1
due,	1
when	1
they	1
dined	1
at	1
the	1
Great	1
House	1
with	1
other	1
families;	1
and	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
any	1
reason	1
why	1
she	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
considered	1
so	1
much	1
at	1
home	1
as	1
to	1
lose	1
her	1
place.	1
And	1
one	1
day	1
when	1
Anne	1
was	1
walking	1
with	1
only	1
the	1
Musgroves,	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
after	1
talking	1
of	1
rank,	1
people	1
of	1
rank,	1
and	1
jealousy	1
of	1
rank,	1
said,	1
"I	1
have	1
no	1
scruple	1
of	1
observing	1
to	1
you,	1
how	1
nonsensical	1
some	1
persons	1
are	1
about	1
their	1
place,	1
because	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
knows	1
how	1
easy	1
and	1
indifferent	1
you	1
are	1
about	1
it;	1
but	1
I	1
wish	1
anybody	1
could	1
give	1
Mary	1
a	1
hint	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
better	1
if	1
she	1
were	1
not	1
so	1
very	1
tenacious,	1
especially	1
if	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
always	1
putting	1
herself	1
forward	1
to	1
take	1
place	1
of	1
mamma.	1
Nobody	1
doubts	1
her	1
right	1
to	1
have	1
precedence	1
of	1
mamma,	1
but	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
more	1
becoming	1
in	1
her	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
always	1
insisting	1
on	1
it.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
that	1
mamma	1
cares	1
about	1
it	1
the	1
least	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
but	1
I	1
know	1
it	1
is	1
taken	1
notice	1
of	1
by	1
many	1
persons."	1
How	1
was	1
Anne	1
to	1
set	1
all	1
these	1
matters	1
to	1
rights?	1
She	1
could	1
do	1
little	1
more	1
than	1
listen	1
patiently,	1
soften	1
every	1
grievance,	1
and	1
excuse	1
each	1
to	1
the	1
other;	1
give	1
them	1
all	1
hints	1
of	1
the	1
forbearance	1
necessary	1
between	1
such	1
near	1
neighbours,	1
and	1
make	1
those	1
hints	1
broadest	1
which	1
were	1
meant	1
for	1
her	1
sister's	1
benefit.	1
In	1
all	1
other	1
respects,	1
her	1
visit	1
began	1
and	1
proceeded	1
very	1
well.	1
Her	1
own	1
spirits	1
improved	1
by	1
change	1
of	1
place	1
and	1
subject,	1
by	1
being	1
removed	1
three	1
miles	1
from	1
Kellynch;	1
Mary's	1
ailments	1
lessened	1
by	1
having	1
a	1
constant	1
companion,	1
and	1
their	1
daily	1
intercourse	1
with	1
the	1
other	1
family,	1
since	1
there	1
was	1
neither	1
superior	1
affection,	1
confidence,	1
nor	1
employment	1
in	1
the	1
cottage,	1
to	1
be	1
interrupted	1
by	1
it,	1
was	1
rather	1
an	1
advantage.	1
It	1
was	1
certainly	1
carried	1
nearly	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
possible,	1
for	1
they	1
met	1
every	1
morning,	1
and	1
hardly	1
ever	1
spent	1
an	1
evening	1
asunder;	1
but	1
she	1
believed	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
done	1
so	1
well	1
without	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
Mr	1
and	1
Mrs	1
Musgrove's	1
respectable	1
forms	1
in	1
the	1
usual	1
places,	1
or	1
without	1
the	1
talking,	1
laughing,	1
and	1
singing	1
of	1
their	1
daughters.	1
She	1
played	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
better	1
than	1
either	1
of	1
the	1
Miss	1
Musgroves,	1
but	1
having	1
no	1
voice,	1
no	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
harp,	1
and	1
no	1
fond	1
parents,	1
to	1
sit	1
by	1
and	1
fancy	1
themselves	1
delighted,	1
her	1
performance	1
was	1
little	1
thought	1
of,	1
only	1
out	1
of	1
civility,	1
or	1
to	1
refresh	1
the	1
others,	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
well	1
aware.	1
She	1
knew	1
that	1
when	1
she	1
played	1
she	1
was	1
giving	1
pleasure	1
only	1
to	1
herself;	1
but	1
this	1
was	1
no	1
new	1
sensation.	1
Excepting	1
one	1
short	1
period	1
of	1
her	1
life,	1
she	1
had	1
never,	1
since	1
the	1
age	1
of	1
fourteen,	1
never	1
since	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
her	1
dear	1
mother,	1
known	1
the	1
happiness	1
of	1
being	1
listened	1
to,	1
or	1
encouraged	1
by	1
any	1
just	1
appreciation	1
or	1
real	1
taste.	1
In	1
music	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
always	1
used	1
to	1
feel	1
alone	1
in	1
the	1
world;	1
and	1
Mr	1
and	1
Mrs	1
Musgrove's	1
fond	1
partiality	1
for	1
their	1
own	1
daughters'	1
performance,	1
and	1
total	1
indifference	1
to	1
any	1
other	1
person's,	1
gave	1
her	1
much	1
more	1
pleasure	1
for	1
their	1
sakes,	1
than	1
mortification	1
for	1
her	1
own.	1
The	1
party	1
at	1
the	1
Great	1
House	1
was	1
sometimes	1
increased	1
by	1
other	1
company.	1
The	1
neighbourhood	1
was	1
not	1
large,	1
but	1
the	1
Musgroves	1
were	1
visited	1
by	1
everybody,	1
and	1
had	1
more	1
dinner-parties,	1
and	1
more	1
callers,	1
more	1
visitors	1
by	1
invitation	1
and	1
by	1
chance,	1
than	1
any	1
other	1
family.	1
There	1
were	1
more	1
completely	1
popular.	1
The	1
girls	1
were	1
wild	1
for	1
dancing;	1
and	1
the	1
evenings	1
ended,	1
occasionally,	1
in	1
an	1
unpremeditated	1
little	1
ball.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
family	1
of	1
cousins	1
within	1
a	1
walk	1
of	1
Uppercross,	1
in	1
less	1
affluent	1
circumstances,	1
who	1
depended	1
on	1
the	1
Musgroves	1
for	1
all	1
their	1
pleasures:	1
they	1
would	1
come	1
at	1
any	1
time,	1
and	1
help	1
play	1
at	1
anything,	1
or	1
dance	1
anywhere;	1
and	1
Anne,	1
very	1
much	1
preferring	1
the	1
office	1
of	1
musician	1
to	1
a	1
more	1
active	1
post,	1
played	1
country	1
dances	1
to	1
them	1
by	1
the	1
hour	1
together;	1
a	1
kindness	1
which	1
always	1
recommended	1
her	1
musical	1
powers	1
to	1
the	1
notice	1
of	1
Mr	1
and	1
Mrs	1
Musgrove	1
more	1
than	1
anything	1
else,	1
and	1
often	1
drew	1
this	1
compliment;--	1
"Well	1
done,	1
Miss	1
Anne!	1
very	1
well	1
done	1
indeed!	1
Lord	1
bless	1
me!	1
how	1
those	1
little	1
fingers	1
of	1
yours	1
fly	1
about!"	1
So	1
passed	1
the	1
first	1
three	1
weeks.	1
Michaelmas	1
came;	1
and	1
now	1
Anne's	1
heart	1
must	1
be	1
in	1
Kellynch	1
again.	1
A	1
beloved	1
home	1
made	1
over	1
to	1
others;	1
all	1
the	1
precious	1
rooms	1
and	1
furniture,	1
groves,	1
and	1
prospects,	1
beginning	1
to	1
own	1
other	1
eyes	1
and	1
other	1
limbs!	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
think	1
of	1
much	1
else	1
on	1
the	1
29th	1
of	1
September;	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
this	1
sympathetic	1
touch	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
from	1
Mary,	1
who,	1
on	1
having	1
occasion	1
to	1
note	1
down	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
month,	1
exclaimed,	1
"Dear	1
me,	1
is	1
not	1
this	1
the	1
day	1
the	1
Crofts	1
were	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
Kellynch?	1
I	1
am	1
glad	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
of	1
it	1
before.	1
How	1
low	1
it	1
makes	1
me!"	1
The	1
Crofts	1
took	1
possession	1
with	1
true	1
naval	1
alertness,	1
and	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
visited.	1
Mary	1
deplored	1
the	1
necessity	1
for	1
herself.	1
"Nobody	1
knew	1
how	1
much	1
she	1
should	1
suffer.	1
She	1
should	1
put	1
it	1
off	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
she	1
could;"	1
but	1
was	1
not	1
easy	1
till	1
she	1
had	1
talked	1
Charles	1
into	1
driving	1
her	1
over	1
on	1
an	1
early	1
day,	1
and	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
animated,	1
comfortable	1
state	1
of	1
imaginary	1
agitation,	1
when	1
she	1
came	1
back.	1
Anne	1
had	1
very	1
sincerely	1
rejoiced	1
in	1
there	1
being	1
no	1
means	1
of	1
her	1
going.	1
She	1
wished,	1
however	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
Crofts,	1
and	1
was	1
glad	1
to	1
be	1
within	1
when	1
the	1
visit	1
was	1
returned.	1
They	1
came:	1
the	1
master	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
was	1
not	1
at	1
home,	1
but	1
the	1
two	1
sisters	1
were	1
together;	1
and	1
as	1
it	1
chanced	1
that	1
Mrs	1
Croft	1
fell	1
to	1
the	1
share	1
of	1
Anne,	1
while	1
the	1
Admiral	1
sat	1
by	1
Mary,	1
and	1
made	1
himself	1
very	1
agreeable	1
by	1
his	1
good-humoured	1
notice	1
of	1
her	1
little	1
boys,	1
she	1
was	1
well	1
able	1
to	1
watch	1
for	1
a	1
likeness,	1
and	1
if	1
it	1
failed	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
features,	1
to	1
catch	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
voice,	1
or	1
in	1
the	1
turn	1
of	1
sentiment	1
and	1
expression.	1
Mrs	1
Croft,	1
though	1
neither	1
tall	1
nor	1
fat,	1
had	1
a	1
squareness,	1
uprightness,	1
and	1
vigour	1
of	1
form,	1
which	1
gave	1
importance	1
to	1
her	1
person.	1
She	1
had	1
bright	1
dark	1
eyes,	1
good	1
teeth,	1
and	1
altogether	1
an	1
agreeable	1
face;	1
though	1
her	1
reddened	1
and	1
weather-beaten	1
complexion,	1
the	1
consequence	1
of	1
her	1
having	1
been	1
almost	1
as	1
much	1
at	1
sea	1
as	1
her	1
husband,	1
made	1
her	1
seem	1
to	1
have	1
lived	1
some	1
years	1
longer	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
than	1
her	1
real	1
eight-and-thirty.	1
Her	1
manners	1
were	1
open,	1
easy,	1
and	1
decided,	1
like	1
one	1
who	1
had	1
no	1
distrust	1
of	1
herself,	1
and	1
no	1
doubts	1
of	1
what	1
to	1
do;	1
without	1
any	1
approach	1
to	1
coarseness,	1
however,	1
or	1
any	1
want	1
of	1
good	1
humour.	1
Anne	1
gave	1
her	1
credit,	1
indeed,	1
for	1
feelings	1
of	1
great	1
consideration	1
towards	1
herself,	1
in	1
all	1
that	1
related	1
to	1
Kellynch,	1
and	1
it	1
pleased	1
her:	1
especially,	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
satisfied	1
herself	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
first	1
half	1
minute,	1
in	1
the	1
instant	1
even	1
of	1
introduction,	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
smallest	1
symptom	1
of	1
any	1
knowledge	1
or	1
suspicion	1
on	1
Mrs	1
Croft's	1
side,	1
to	1
give	1
a	1
bias	1
of	1
any	1
sort.	1
She	1
was	1
quite	1
easy	1
on	1
that	1
head,	1
and	1
consequently	1
full	1
of	1
strength	1
and	1
courage,	1
till	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
electrified	1
by	1
Mrs	1
Croft's	1
suddenly	1
saying,--	1
"It	1
was	1
you,	1
and	1
not	1
your	1
sister,	1
I	1
find,	1
that	1
my	1
brother	1
had	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
being	1
acquainted	1
with,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
this	1
country."	1
Anne	1
hoped	1
she	1
had	1
outlived	1
the	1
age	1
of	1
blushing;	1
but	1
the	1
age	1
of	1
emotion	1
she	1
certainly	1
had	1
not.	1
"Perhaps	1
you	1
may	1
not	1
have	1
heard	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
married?"	1
added	1
Mrs	1
Croft.	1
She	1
could	1
now	1
answer	1
as	1
she	1
ought;	1
and	1
was	1
happy	1
to	1
feel,	1
when	1
Mrs	1
Croft's	1
next	1
words	1
explained	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
Mr	1
Wentworth	1
of	1
whom	1
she	1
spoke,	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
said	1
nothing	1
which	1
might	1
not	1
do	1
for	1
either	1
brother.	1
She	1
immediately	1
felt	1
how	1
reasonable	1
it	1
was,	1
that	1
Mrs	1
Croft	1
should	1
be	1
thinking	1
and	1
speaking	1
of	1
Edward,	1
and	1
not	1
of	1
Frederick;	1
and	1
with	1
shame	1
at	1
her	1
own	1
forgetfulness	1
applied	1
herself	1
to	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
their	1
former	1
neighbour's	1
present	1
state	1
with	1
proper	1
interest.	1
The	1
rest	1
was	1
all	1
tranquillity;	1
till,	1
just	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
moving,	1
she	1
heard	1
the	1
Admiral	1
say	1
to	1
Mary--	1
"We	1
are	1
expecting	1
a	1
brother	1
of	1
Mrs	1
Croft's	1
here	1
soon;	1
I	1
dare	1
say	1
you	1
know	1
him	1
by	1
name."	1
He	1
was	1
cut	1
short	1
by	1
the	1
eager	1
attacks	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
boys,	1
clinging	1
to	1
him	1
like	1
an	1
old	1
friend,	1
and	1
declaring	1
he	1
should	1
not	1
go;	1
and	1
being	1
too	1
much	1
engrossed	1
by	1
proposals	1
of	1
carrying	1
them	1
away	1
in	1
his	1
coat	1
pockets,	1
&c.,	1
to	1
have	1
another	1
moment	1
for	1
finishing	1
or	1
recollecting	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
begun,	1
Anne	1
was	1
left	1
to	1
persuade	1
herself,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
she	1
could,	1
that	1
the	1
same	1
brother	1
must	1
still	1
be	1
in	1
question.	1
She	1
could	1
not,	1
however,	1
reach	1
such	1
a	1
degree	1
of	1
certainty,	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
anxious	1
to	1
hear	1
whether	1
anything	1
had	1
been	1
said	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
house,	1
where	1
the	1
Crofts	1
had	1
previously	1
been	1
calling.	1
The	1
folks	1
of	1
the	1
Great	1
House	1
were	1
to	1
spend	1
the	1
evening	1
of	1
this	1
day	1
at	1
the	1
Cottage;	1
and	1
it	1
being	1
now	1
too	1
late	1
in	1
the	1
year	1
for	1
such	1
visits	1
to	1
be	1
made	1
on	1
foot,	1
the	1
coach	1
was	1
beginning	1
to	1
be	1
listened	1
for,	1
when	1
the	1
youngest	1
Miss	1
Musgrove	1
walked	1
in.	1
That	1
she	1
was	1
coming	1
to	1
apologize,	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
have	1
to	1
spend	1
the	1
evening	1
by	1
themselves,	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
black	1
idea;	1
and	1
Mary	1
was	1
quite	1
ready	1
to	1
be	1
affronted,	1
when	1
Louisa	1
made	1
all	1
right	1
by	1
saying,	1
that	1
she	1
only	1
came	1
on	1
foot,	1
to	1
leave	1
more	1
room	1
for	1
the	1
harp,	1
which	1
was	1
bringing	1
in	1
the	1
carriage.	1
"And	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
you	1
our	1
reason,"	1
she	1
added,	1
"and	1
all	1
about	1
it.	1
I	1
am	1
come	1
on	1
to	1
give	1
you	1
notice,	1
that	1
papa	1
and	1
mamma	1
are	1
out	1
of	1
spirits	1
this	1
evening,	1
especially	1
mamma;	1
she	1
is	1
thinking	1
so	1
much	1
of	1
poor	1
Richard!	1
And	1
we	1
agreed	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
best	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
harp,	1
for	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
amuse	1
her	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
piano-forte.	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
you	1
why	1
she	1
is	1
out	1
of	1
spirits.	1
When	1
the	1
Crofts	1
called	1
this	1
morning,	1
(they	1
called	1
here	1
afterwards,	1
did	1
not	1
they?),	1
they	1
happened	1
to	1
say,	1
that	1
her	1
brother,	1
Captain	1
Wentworth,	1
is	1
just	1
returned	1
to	1
England,	1
or	1
paid	1
off,	1
or	1
something,	1
and	1
is	1
coming	1
to	1
see	1
them	1
almost	1
directly;	1
and	1
most	1
unluckily	1
it	1
came	1
into	1
mamma's	1
head,	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
gone,	1
that	1
Wentworth,	1
or	1
something	1
very	1
like	1
it,	1
was	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
poor	1
Richard's	1
captain	1
at	1
one	1
time;	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
when	1
or	1
where,	1
but	1
a	1
great	1
while	1
before	1
he	1
died,	1
poor	1
fellow!	1
And	1
upon	1
looking	1
over	1
his	1
letters	1
and	1
things,	1
she	1
found	1
it	1
was	1
so,	1
and	1
is	1
perfectly	1
sure	1
that	1
this	1
must	1
be	1
the	1
very	1
man,	1
and	1
her	1
head	1
is	1
quite	1
full	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
of	1
poor	1
Richard!	1
So	1
we	1
must	1
be	1
as	1
merry	1
as	1
we	1
can,	1
that	1
she	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
dwelling	1
upon	1
such	1
gloomy	1
things."	1
The	1
real	1
circumstances	1
of	1
this	1
pathetic	1
piece	1
of	1
family	1
history	1
were,	1
that	1
the	1
Musgroves	1
had	1
had	1
the	1
ill	1
fortune	1
of	1
a	1
very	1
troublesome,	1
hopeless	1
son;	1
and	1
the	1
good	1
fortune	1
to	1
lose	1
him	1
before	1
he	1
reached	1
his	1
twentieth	1
year;	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
sent	1
to	1
sea	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
stupid	1
and	1
unmanageable	1
on	1
shore;	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
very	1
little	1
cared	1
for	1
at	1
any	1
time	1
by	1
his	1
family,	1
though	1
quite	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
he	1
deserved;	1
seldom	1
heard	1
of,	1
and	1
scarcely	1
at	1
all	1
regretted,	1
when	1
the	1
intelligence	1
of	1
his	1
death	1
abroad	1
had	1
worked	1
its	1
way	1
to	1
Uppercross,	1
two	1
years	1
before.	1
He	1
had,	1
in	1
fact,	1
though	1
his	1
sisters	1
were	1
now	1
doing	1
all	1
they	1
could	1
for	1
him,	1
by	1
calling	1
him	1
"poor	1
Richard,"	1
been	1
nothing	1
better	1
than	1
a	1
thick-headed,	1
unfeeling,	1
unprofitable	1
Dick	1
Musgrove,	1
who	1
had	1
never	1
done	1
anything	1
to	1
entitle	1
himself	1
to	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
abbreviation	1
of	1
his	1
name,	1
living	1
or	1
dead.	1
He	1
had	1
been	1
several	1
years	1
at	1
sea,	1
and	1
had,	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
those	1
removals	1
to	1
which	1
all	1
midshipmen	1
are	1
liable,	1
and	1
especially	1
such	1
midshipmen	1
as	1
every	1
captain	1
wishes	1
to	1
get	1
rid	1
of,	1
been	1
six	1
months	1
on	1
board	1
Captain	1
Frederick	1
Wentworth's	1
frigate,	1
the	1
Laconia;	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
Laconia	1
he	1
had,	1
under	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
his	1
captain,	1
written	1
the	1
only	1
two	1
letters	1
which	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
mother	1
had	1
ever	1
received	1
from	1
him	1
during	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
his	1
absence;	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
the	1
only	1
two	1
disinterested	1
letters;	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
had	1
been	1
mere	1
applications	1
for	1
money.	1
In	1
each	1
letter	1
he	1
had	1
spoken	1
well	1
of	1
his	1
captain;	1
but	1
yet,	1
so	1
little	1
were	1
they	1
in	1
the	1
habit	1
of	1
attending	1
to	1
such	1
matters,	1
so	1
unobservant	1
and	1
incurious	1
were	1
they	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
men	1
or	1
ships,	1
that	1
it	1
had	1
made	1
scarcely	1
any	1
impression	1
at	1
the	1
time;	1
and	1
that	1
Mrs	1
Musgrove	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
suddenly	1
struck,	1
this	1
very	1
day,	1
with	1
a	1
recollection	1
of	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Wentworth,	1
as	1
connected	1
with	1
her	1
son,	1
seemed	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
extraordinary	1
bursts	1
of	1
mind	1
which	1
do	1
sometimes	1
occur.	1
She	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
her	1
letters,	1
and	1
found	1
it	1
all	1
as	1
she	1
supposed;	1
and	1
the	1
re-perusal	1
of	1
these	1
letters,	1
after	1
so	1
long	1
an	1
interval,	1
her	1
poor	1
son	1
gone	1
for	1
ever,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
his	1
faults	1
forgotten,	1
had	1
affected	1
her	1
spirits	1
exceedingly,	1
and	1
thrown	1
her	1
into	1
greater	1
grief	1
for	1
him	1
than	1
she	1
had	1
know	1
on	1
first	1
hearing	1
of	1
his	1
death.	1
Mr	1
Musgrove	1
was,	1
in	1
a	1
lesser	1
degree,	1
affected	1
likewise;	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
reached	1
the	1
cottage,	1
they	1
were	1
evidently	1
in	1
want,	1
first,	1
of	1
being	1
listened	1
to	1
anew	1
on	1
this	1
subject,	1
and	1
afterwards,	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
relief	1
which	1
cheerful	1
companions	1
could	1
give	1
them.	1
To	1
hear	1
them	1
talking	1
so	1
much	1
of	1
Captain	1
Wentworth,	1
repeating	1
his	1
name	1
so	1
often,	1
puzzling	1
over	1
past	1
years,	1
and	1
at	1
last	1
ascertaining	1
that	1
it	1
might,	1
that	1
it	1
probably	1
would,	1
turn	1
out	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
very	1
same	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
whom	1
they	1
recollected	1
meeting,	1
once	1
or	1
twice,	1
after	1
their	1
coming	1
back	1
from	1
Clifton--a	1
very	1
fine	1
young	1
man--but	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
say	1
whether	1
it	1
was	1
seven	1
or	1
eight	1
years	1
ago,	1
was	1
a	1
new	1
sort	1
of	1
trial	1
to	1
Anne's	1
nerves.	1
She	1
found,	1
however,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
one	1
to	1
which	1
she	1
must	1
inure	1
herself.	1
Since	1
he	1
actually	1
was	1
expected	1
in	1
the	1
country,	1
she	1
must	1
teach	1
herself	1
to	1
be	1
insensible	1
on	1
such	1
points.	1
And	1
not	1
only	1
did	1
it	1
appear	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
expected,	1
and	1
speedily,	1
but	1
the	1
Musgroves,	1
in	1
their	1
warm	1
gratitude	1
for	1
the	1
kindness	1
he	1
had	1
shewn	1
poor	1
Dick,	1
and	1
very	1
high	1
respect	1
for	1
his	1
character,	1
stamped	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
by	1
poor	1
Dick's	1
having	1
been	1
six	1
months	1
under	1
his	1
care,	1
and	1
mentioning	1
him	1
in	1
strong,	1
though	1
not	1
perfectly	1
well-spelt	1
praise,	1
as	1
"a	1
fine	1
dashing	1
felow,	1
only	1
two	1
perticular	1
about	1
the	1
schoolmaster,"	1
were	1
bent	1
on	1
introducing	1
themselves,	1
and	1
seeking	1
his	1
acquaintance,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
could	1
hear	1
of	1
his	1
arrival.	1
The	1
resolution	1
of	1
doing	1
so	1
helped	1
to	1
form	1
the	1
comfort	1
of	1
their	1
evening.	1
Chapter	1
7	1
A	1
very	1
few	1
days	1
more,	1
and	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
was	1
known	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
Kellynch,	1
and	1
Mr	1
Musgrove	1
had	1
called	1
on	1
him,	1
and	1
come	1
back	1
warm	1
in	1
his	1
praise,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
engaged	1
with	1
the	1
Crofts	1
to	1
dine	1
at	1
Uppercross,	1
by	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
another	1
week.	1
It	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
great	1
disappointment	1
to	1
Mr	1
Musgrove	1
to	1
find	1
that	1
no	1
earlier	1
day	1
could	1
be	1
fixed,	1
so	1
impatient	1
was	1
he	1
to	1
shew	1
his	1
gratitude,	1
by	1
seeing	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
under	1
his	1
own	1
roof,	1
and	1
welcoming	1
him	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
strongest	1
and	1
best	1
in	1
his	1
cellars.	1
But	1
a	1
week	1
must	1
pass;	1
only	1
a	1
week,	1
in	1
Anne's	1
reckoning,	1
and	1
then,	1
she	1
supposed,	1
they	1
must	1
meet;	1
and	1
soon	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
wish	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
feel	1
secure	1
even	1
for	1
a	1
week.	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
made	1
a	1
very	1
early	1
return	1
to	1
Mr	1
Musgrove's	1
civility,	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
all	1
but	1
calling	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
half	1
hour.	1
She	1
and	1
Mary	1
were	1
actually	1
setting	1
forward	1
for	1
the	1
Great	1
House,	1
where,	1
as	1
she	1
afterwards	1
learnt,	1
they	1
must	1
inevitably	1
have	1
found	1
him,	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
stopped	1
by	1
the	1
eldest	1
boy's	1
being	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
brought	1
home	1
in	1
consequence	1
of	1
a	1
bad	1
fall.	1
The	1
child's	1
situation	1
put	1
the	1
visit	1
entirely	1
aside;	1
but	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
hear	1
of	1
her	1
escape	1
with	1
indifference,	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
serious	1
anxiety	1
which	1
they	1
afterwards	1
felt	1
on	1
his	1
account.	1
His	1
collar-bone	1
was	1
found	1
to	1
be	1
dislocated,	1
and	1
such	1
injury	1
received	1
in	1
the	1
back,	1
as	1
roused	1
the	1
most	1
alarming	1
ideas.	1
It	1
was	1
an	1
afternoon	1
of	1
distress,	1
and	1
Anne	1
had	1
every	1
thing	1
to	1
do	1
at	1
once;	1
the	1
apothecary	1
to	1
send	1
for,	1
the	1
father	1
to	1
have	1
pursued	1
and	1
informed,	1
the	1
mother	1
to	1
support	1
and	1
keep	1
from	1
hysterics,	1
the	1
servants	1
to	1
control,	1
the	1
youngest	1
child	1
to	1
banish,	1
and	1
the	1
poor	1
suffering	1
one	1
to	1
attend	1
and	1
soothe;	1
besides	1
sending,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
recollected	1
it,	1
proper	1
notice	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
house,	1
which	1
brought	1
her	1
an	1
accession	1
rather	1
of	1
frightened,	1
enquiring	1
companions,	1
than	1
of	1
very	1
useful	1
assistants.	1
Her	1
brother's	1
return	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
comfort;	1
he	1
could	1
take	1
best	1
care	1
of	1
his	1
wife;	1
and	1
the	1
second	1
blessing	1
was	1
the	1
arrival	1
of	1
the	1
apothecary.	1
Till	1
he	1
came	1
and	1
had	1
examined	1
the	1
child,	1
their	1
apprehensions	1
were	1
the	1
worse	1
for	1
being	1
vague;	1
they	1
suspected	1
great	1
injury,	1
but	1
knew	1
not	1
where;	1
but	1
now	1
the	1
collar-bone	1
was	1
soon	1
replaced,	1
and	1
though	1
Mr	1
Robinson	1
felt	1
and	1
felt,	1
and	1
rubbed,	1
and	1
looked	1
grave,	1
and	1
spoke	1
low	1
words	1
both	1
to	1
the	1
father	1
and	1
the	1
aunt,	1
still	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
to	1
hope	1
the	1
best,	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
part	1
and	1
eat	1
their	1
dinner	1
in	1
tolerable	1
ease	1
of	1
mind;	1
and	1
then	1
it	1
was,	1
just	1
before	1
they	1
parted,	1
that	1
the	1
two	1
young	1
aunts	1
were	1
able	1
so	1
far	1
to	1
digress	1
from	1
their	1
nephew's	1
state,	1
as	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
information	1
of	1
Captain	1
Wentworth's	1
visit;	1
staying	1
five	1
minutes	1
behind	1
their	1
father	1
and	1
mother,	1
to	1
endeavour	1
to	1
express	1
how	1
perfectly	1
delighted	1
they	1
were	1
with	1
him,	1
how	1
much	1
handsomer,	1
how	1
infinitely	1
more	1
agreeable	1
they	1
thought	1
him	1
than	1
any	1
individual	1
among	1
their	1
male	1
acquaintance,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
at	1
all	1
a	1
favourite	1
before.	1
How	1
glad	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
to	1
hear	1
papa	1
invite	1
him	1
to	1
stay	1
dinner,	1
how	1
sorry	1
when	1
he	1
said	1
it	1
was	1
quite	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
power,	1
and	1
how	1
glad	1
again	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
promised	1
in	1
reply	1
to	1
papa	1
and	1
mamma's	1
farther	1
pressing	1
invitations	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
dine	1
with	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
morrow--actually	1
on	1
the	1
morrow;	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
promised	1
it	1
in	1
so	1
pleasant	1
a	1
manner,	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
felt	1
all	1
the	1
motive	1
of	1
their	1
attention	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
ought.	1
And	1
in	1
short,	1
he	1
had	1
looked	1
and	1
said	1
everything	1
with	1
such	1
exquisite	1
grace,	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
assure	1
them	1
all,	1
their	1
heads	1
were	1
both	1
turned	1
by	1
him;	1
and	1
off	1
they	1
ran,	1
quite	1
as	1
full	1
of	1
glee	1
as	1
of	1
love,	1
and	1
apparently	1
more	1
full	1
of	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
than	1
of	1
little	1
Charles.	1
The	1
same	1
story	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
raptures	1
were	1
repeated,	1
when	1
the	1
two	1
girls	1
came	1
with	1
their	1
father,	1
through	1
the	1
gloom	1
of	1
the	1
evening,	1
to	1
make	1
enquiries;	1
and	1
Mr	1
Musgrove,	1
no	1
longer	1
under	1
the	1
first	1
uneasiness	1
about	1
his	1
heir,	1
could	1
add	1
his	1
confirmation	1
and	1
praise,	1
and	1
hope	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
now	1
no	1
occasion	1
for	1
putting	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
off,	1
and	1
only	1
be	1
sorry	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
the	1
cottage	1
party,	1
probably,	1
would	1
not	1
like	1
to	1
leave	1
the	1
little	1
boy,	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
the	1
meeting.	1
"Oh	1
no;	1
as	1
to	1
leaving	1
the	1
little	1
boy,"	1
both	1
father	1
and	1
mother	1
were	1
in	1
much	1
too	1
strong	1
and	1
recent	1
alarm	1
to	1
bear	1
the	1
thought;	1
and	1
Anne,	1
in	1
the	1
joy	1
of	1
the	1
escape,	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
adding	1
her	1
warm	1
protestations	1
to	1
theirs.	1
Charles	1
Musgrove,	1
indeed,	1
afterwards,	1
shewed	1
more	1
of	1
inclination;	1
"the	1
child	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
so	1
well,	1
and	1
he	1
wished	1
so	1
much	1
to	1
be	1
introduced	1
to	1
Captain	1
Wentworth,	1
that,	1
perhaps,	1
he	1
might	1
join	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
evening;	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
dine	1
from	1
home,	1
but	1
he	1
might	1
walk	1
in	1
for	1
half	1
an	1
hour."	1
But	1
in	1
this	1
he	1
was	1
eagerly	1
opposed	1
by	1
his	1
wife,	1
with	1
"Oh!	1
no,	1
indeed,	1
Charles,	1
I	1
cannot	1
bear	1
to	1
have	1
you	1
go	1
away.	1
Only	1
think	1
if	1
anything	1
should	1
happen?"	1
The	1
child	1
had	1
a	1
good	1
night,	1
and	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
well	1
the	1
next	1
day.	1
It	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
work	1
of	1
time	1
to	1
ascertain	1
that	1
no	1
injury	1
had	1
been	1
done	1
to	1
the	1
spine;	1
but	1
Mr	1
Robinson	1
found	1
nothing	1
to	1
increase	1
alarm,	1
and	1
Charles	1
Musgrove	1
began,	1
consequently,	1
to	1
feel	1
no	1
necessity	1
for	1
longer	1
confinement.	1
The	1
child	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
kept	1
in	1
bed	1
and	1
amused	1
as	1
quietly	1
as	1
possible;	1
but	1
what	1
was	1
there	1
for	1
a	1
father	1
to	1
do?	1
This	1
was	1
quite	1
a	1
female	1
case,	1
and	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
highly	1
absurd	1
in	1
him,	1
who	1
could	1
be	1
of	1
no	1
use	1
at	1
home,	1
to	1
shut	1
himself	1
up.	1
His	1
father	1
very	1
much	1
wished	1
him	1
to	1
meet	1
Captain	1
Wentworth,	1
and	1
there	1
being	1
no	1
sufficient	1
reason	1
against	1
it,	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
go;	1
and	1
it	1
ended	1
in	1
his	1
making	1
a	1
bold,	1
public	1
declaration,	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
in	1
from	1
shooting,	1
of	1
his	1
meaning	1
to	1
dress	1
directly,	1
and	1
dine	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
house.	1
"Nothing	1
can	1
be	1
going	1
on	1
better	1
than	1
the	1
child,"	1
said	1
he;	1
"so	1
I	1
told	1
my	1
father,	1
just	1
now,	1
that	1
I	1
would	1
come,	1
and	1
he	1
thought	1
me	1
quite	1
right.	1
Your	1
sister	1
being	1
with	1
you,	1
my	1
love,	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
scruple	1
at	1
all.	1
You	1
would	1
not	1
like	1
to	1
leave	1
him	1
yourself,	1
but	1
you	1
see	1
I	1
can	1
be	1
of	1
no	1
use.	1
Anne	1
will	1
send	1
for	1
me	1
if	1
anything	1
is	1
the	1
matter."	1
Husbands	1
and	1
wives	1
generally	1
understand	1
when	1
opposition	1
will	1
be	1
vain.	1
Mary	1
knew,	1
from	1
Charles's	1
manner	1
of	1
speaking,	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
quite	1
determined	1
on	1
going,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
of	1
no	1
use	1
to	1
teaze	1
him.	1
She	1
said	1
nothing,	1
therefore,	1
till	1
he	1
was	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room,	1
but	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
there	1
was	1
only	1
Anne	1
to	1
hear--	1
"So	1
you	1
and	1
I	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
left	1
to	1
shift	1
by	1
ourselves,	1
with	1
this	1
poor	1
sick	1
child;	1
and	1
not	1
a	1
creature	1
coming	1
near	1
us	1
all	1
the	1
evening!	1
I	1
knew	1
how	1
it	1
would	1
be.	1
This	1
is	1
always	1
my	1
luck.	1
If	1
there	1
is	1
anything	1
disagreeable	1
going	1
on	1
men	1
are	1
always	1
sure	1
to	1
get	1
out	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
Charles	1
is	1
as	1
bad	1
as	1
any	1
of	1
them.	1
Very	1
unfeeling!	1
I	1
must	1
say	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
unfeeling	1
of	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
running	1
away	1
from	1
his	1
poor	1
little	1
boy.	1
Talks	1
of	1
his	1
being	1
going	1
on	1
so	1
well!	1
How	1
does	1
he	1
know	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
going	1
on	1
well,	1
or	1
that	1
there	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
a	1
sudden	1
change	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
hence?	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
Charles	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
so	1
unfeeling.	1
So	1
here	1
he	1
is	1
to	1
go	1
away	1
and	1
enjoy	1
himself,	1
and	1
because	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
poor	1
mother,	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
allowed	1
to	1
stir;	1
and	1
yet,	1
I	1
am	1
sure,	1
I	1
am	1
more	1
unfit	1
than	1
anybody	1
else	1
to	1
be	1
about	1
the	1
child.	1
My	1
being	1
the	1
mother	1
is	1
the	1
very	1
reason	1
why	1
my	1
feelings	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
tried.	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
equal	1
to	1
it.	1
You	1
saw	1
how	1
hysterical	1
I	1
was	1
yesterday."	1
"But	1
that	1
was	1
only	1
the	1
effect	1
of	1
the	1
suddenness	1
of	1
your	1
alarm--	1
of	1
the	1
shock.	1
You	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
hysterical	1
again.	1
I	1
dare	1
say	1
we	1
shall	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
distress	1
us.	1
I	1
perfectly	1
understand	1
Mr	1
Robinson's	1
directions,	1
and	1
have	1
no	1
fears;	1
and	1
indeed,	1
Mary,	1
I	1
cannot	1
wonder	1
at	1
your	1
husband.	1
Nursing	1
does	1
not	1
belong	1
to	1
a	1
man;	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
his	1
province.	1
A	1
sick	1
child	1
is	1
always	1
the	1
mother's	1
property:	1
her	1
own	1
feelings	1
generally	1
make	1
it	1
so."	1
"I	1
hope	1
I	1
am	1
as	1
fond	1
of	1
my	1
child	1
as	1
any	1
mother,	1
but	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
of	1
any	1
more	1
use	1
in	1
the	1
sick-room	1
than	1
Charles,	1
for	1
I	1
cannot	1
be	1
always	1
scolding	1
and	1
teazing	1
the	1
poor	1
child	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
ill;	1
and	1
you	1
saw,	1
this	1
morning,	1
that	1
if	1
I	1
told	1
him	1
to	1
keep	1
quiet,	1
he	1
was	1
sure	1
to	1
begin	1
kicking	1
about.	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
nerves	1
for	1
the	1
sort	1
of	1
thing."	1
"But,	1
could	1
you	1
be	1
comfortable	1
yourself,	1
to	1
be	1
spending	1
the	1
whole	1
evening	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
poor	1
boy?"	1
"Yes;	1
you	1
see	1
his	1
papa	1
can,	1
and	1
why	1
should	1
not	1
I?	1
Jemima	1
is	1
so	1
careful;	1
and	1
she	1
could	1
send	1
us	1
word	1
every	1
hour	1
how	1
he	1
was.	1
I	1
really	1
think	1
Charles	1
might	1
as	1
well	1
have	1
told	1
his	1
father	1
we	1
would	1
all	1
come.	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
more	1
alarmed	1
about	1
little	1
Charles	1
now	1
than	1
he	1
is.	1
I	1
was	1
dreadfully	1
alarmed	1
yesterday,	1
but	1
the	1
case	1
is	1
very	1
different	1
to-day."	1
"Well,	1
if	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
it	1
too	1
late	1
to	1
give	1
notice	1
for	1
yourself,	1
suppose	1
you	1
were	1
to	1
go,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
your	1
husband.	1
Leave	1
little	1
Charles	1
to	1
my	1
care.	1
Mr	1
and	1
Mrs	1
Musgrove	1
cannot	1
think	1
it	1
wrong	1
while	1
I	1
remain	1
with	1
him."	1
"Are	1
you	1
serious?"	1
cried	1
Mary,	1
her	1
eyes	1
brightening.	1
"Dear	1
me!	1
that's	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
thought,	1
very	1
good,	1
indeed.	1
To	1
be	1
sure,	1
I	1
may	1
just	1
as	1
well	1
go	1
as	1
not,	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
of	1
no	1
use	1
at	1
home--am	1
I?	1
and	1
it	1
only	1
harasses	1
me.	1
You,	1
who	1
have	1
not	1
a	1
mother's	1
feelings,	1
are	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
the	1
properest	1
person.	1
You	1
can	1
make	1
little	1
Charles	1
do	1
anything;	1
he	1
always	1
minds	1
you	1
at	1
a	1
word.	1
It	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
better	1
than	1
leaving	1
him	1
only	1
with	1
Jemima.	1
Oh!	1
I	1
shall	1
certainly	1
go;	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
I	1
ought	1
if	1
I	1
can,	1
quite	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
Charles,	1
for	1
they	1
want	1
me	1
excessively	1
to	1
be	1
acquainted	1
with	1
Captain	1
Wentworth,	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
mind	1
being	1
left	1
alone.	1
An	1
excellent	1
thought	1
of	1
yours,	1
indeed,	1
Anne.	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
and	1
tell	1
Charles,	1
and	1
get	1
ready	1
directly.	1
You	1
can	1
send	1
for	1
us,	1
you	1
know,	1
at	1
a	1
moment's	1
notice,	1
if	1
anything	1
is	1
the	1
matter;	1
but	1
I	1
dare	1
say	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
nothing	1
to	1
alarm	1
you.	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
go,	1
you	1
may	1
be	1
sure,	1
if	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
feel	1
quite	1
at	1
ease	1
about	1
my	1
dear	1
child."	1
The	1
next	1
moment	1
she	1
was	1
tapping	1
at	1
her	1
husband's	1
dressing-room	1
door,	1
and	1
as	1
Anne	1
followed	1
her	1
up	1
stairs,	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
time	1
for	1
the	1
whole	1
conversation,	1
which	1
began	1
with	1
Mary's	1
saying,	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
of	1
great	1
exultation--	1
"I	1
mean	1
to	1
go	1
with	1
you,	1
Charles,	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
of	1
no	1
more	1
use	1
at	1
home	1
than	1
you	1
are.	1
If	1
I	1
were	1
to	1
shut	1
myself	1
up	1
for	1
ever	1
with	1
the	1
child,	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
persuade	1
him	1
to	1
do	1
anything	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
like.	1
Anne	1
will	1
stay;	1
Anne	1
undertakes	1
to	1
stay	1
at	1
home	1
and	1
take	1
care	1
of	1
him.	1
It	1
is	1
Anne's	1
own	1
proposal,	1
and	1
so	1
I	1
shall	1
go	1
with	1
you,	1
which	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
better,	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
dined	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
house	1
since	1
Tuesday."	1
"This	1
is	1
very	1
kind	1
of	1
Anne,"	1
was	1
her	1
husband's	1
answer,	1
"and	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
have	1
you	1
go;	1
but	1
it	1
seems	1
rather	1
hard	1
that	1
she	1
should	1
be	1
left	1
at	1
home	1
by	1
herself,	1
to	1
nurse	1
our	1
sick	1
child."	1
Anne	1
was	1
now	1
at	1
hand	1
to	1
take	1
up	1
her	1
own	1
cause,	1
and	1
the	1
sincerity	1
of	1
her	1
manner	1
being	1
soon	1
sufficient	1
to	1
convince	1
him,	1
where	1
conviction	1
was	1
at	1
least	1
very	1
agreeable,	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
farther	1
scruples	1
as	1
to	1
her	1
being	1
left	1
to	1
dine	1
alone,	1
though	1
he	1
still	1
wanted	1
her	1
to	1
join	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
evening,	1
when	1
the	1
child	1
might	1
be	1
at	1
rest	1
for	1
the	1
night,	1
and	1
kindly	1
urged	1
her	1
to	1
let	1
him	1
come	1
and	1
fetch	1
her,	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
quite	1
unpersuadable;	1
and	1
this	1
being	1
the	1
case,	1
she	1
had	1
ere	1
long	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
seeing	1
them	1
set	1
off	1
together	1
in	1
high	1
spirits.	1
They	1
were	1
gone,	1
she	1
hoped,	1
to	1
be	1
happy,	1
however	1
oddly	1
constructed	1
such	1
happiness	1
might	1
seem;	1
as	1
for	1
herself,	1
she	1
was	1
left	1
with	1
as	1
many	1
sensations	1
of	1
comfort,	1
as	1
were,	1
perhaps,	1
ever	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
hers.	1
She	1
knew	1
herself	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
utility	1
to	1
the	1
child;	1
and	1
what	1
was	1
it	1
to	1
her	1
if	1
Frederick	1
Wentworth	1
were	1
only	1
half	1
a	1
mile	1
distant,	1
making	1
himself	1
agreeable	1
to	1
others?	1
She	1
would	1
have	1
liked	1
to	1
know	1
how	1
he	1
felt	1
as	1
to	1
a	1
meeting.	1
Perhaps	1
indifferent,	1
if	1
indifference	1
could	1
exist	1
under	1
such	1
circumstances.	1
He	1
must	1
be	1
either	1
indifferent	1
or	1
unwilling.	1
Had	1
he	1
wished	1
ever	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
again,	1
he	1
need	1
not	1
have	1
waited	1
till	1
this	1
time;	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
done	1
what	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
believe	1
that	1
in	1
his	1
place	1
she	1
should	1
have	1
done	1
long	1
ago,	1
when	1
events	1
had	1
been	1
early	1
giving	1
him	1
the	1
independence	1
which	1
alone	1
had	1
been	1
wanting.	1
Her	1
brother	1
and	1
sister	1
came	1
back	1
delighted	1
with	1
their	1
new	1
acquaintance,	1
and	1
their	1
visit	1
in	1
general.	1
There	1
had	1
been	1
music,	1
singing,	1
talking,	1
laughing,	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
most	1
agreeable;	1
charming	1
manners	1
in	1
Captain	1
Wentworth,	1
no	1
shyness	1
or	1
reserve;	1
they	1
seemed	1
all	1
to	1
know	1
each	1
other	1
perfectly,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
coming	1
the	1
very	1
next	1
morning	1
to	1
shoot	1
with	1
Charles.	1
He	1
was	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
breakfast,	1
but	1
not	1
at	1
the	1
Cottage,	1
though	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
proposed	1
at	1
first;	1
but	1
then	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
pressed	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
Great	1
House	1
instead,	1
and	1
he	1
seemed	1
afraid	1
of	1
being	1
in	1
Mrs	1
Charles	1
Musgrove's	1
way,	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
child,	1
and	1
therefore,	1
somehow,	1
they	1
hardly	1
knew	1
how,	1
it	1
ended	1
in	1
Charles's	1
being	1
to	1
meet	1
him	1
to	1
breakfast	1
at	1
his	1
father's.	1
Anne	1
understood	1
it.	1
He	1
wished	1
to	1
avoid	1
seeing	1
her.	1
He	1
had	1
inquired	1
after	1
her,	1
she	1
found,	1
slightly,	1
as	1
might	1
suit	1
a	1
former	1
slight	1
acquaintance,	1
seeming	1
to	1
acknowledge	1
such	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
acknowledged,	1
actuated,	1
perhaps,	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
view	1
of	1
escaping	1
introduction	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
meet.	1
The	1
morning	1
hours	1
of	1
the	1
Cottage	1
were	1
always	1
later	1
than	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
house,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
morrow	1
the	1
difference	1
was	1
so	1
great	1
that	1
Mary	1
and	1
Anne	1
were	1
not	1
more	1
than	1
beginning	1
breakfast	1
when	1
Charles	1
came	1
in	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
just	1
setting	1
off,	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
for	1
his	1
dogs,	1
that	1
his	1
sisters	1
were	1
following	1
with	1
Captain	1
Wentworth;	1
his	1
sisters	1
meaning	1
to	1
visit	1
Mary	1
and	1
the	1
child,	1
and	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
proposing	1
also	1
to	1
wait	1
on	1
her	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
if	1
not	1
inconvenient;	1
and	1
though	1
Charles	1
had	1
answered	1
for	1
the	1
child's	1
being	1
in	1
no	1
such	1
state	1
as	1
could	1
make	1
it	1
inconvenient,	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
satisfied	1
without	1
his	1
running	1
on	1
to	1
give	1
notice.	1
Mary,	1
very	1
much	1
gratified	1
by	1
this	1
attention,	1
was	1
delighted	1
to	1
receive	1
him,	1
while	1
a	1
thousand	1
feelings	1
rushed	1
on	1
Anne,	1
of	1
which	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
most	1
consoling,	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
soon	1
be	1
over.	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
soon	1
over.	1
In	1
two	1
minutes	1
after	1
Charles's	1
preparation,	1
the	1
others	1
appeared;	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
drawing-room.	1
Her	1
eye	1
half	1
met	1
Captain	1
Wentworth's,	1
a	1
bow,	1
a	1
curtsey	1
passed;	1
she	1
heard	1
his	1
voice;	1
he	1
talked	1
to	1
Mary,	1
said	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
right,	1
said	1
something	1
to	1
the	1
Miss	1
Musgroves,	1
enough	1
to	1
mark	1
an	1
easy	1
footing;	1
the	1
room	1
seemed	1
full,	1
full	1
of	1
persons	1
and	1
voices,	1
but	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
ended	1
it.	1
Charles	1
shewed	1
himself	1
at	1
the	1
window,	1
all	1
was	1
ready,	1
their	1
visitor	1
had	1
bowed	1
and	1
was	1
gone,	1
the	1
Miss	1
Musgroves	1
were	1
gone	1
too,	1
suddenly	1
resolving	1
to	1
walk	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
village	1
with	1
the	1
sportsmen:	1
the	1
room	1
was	1
cleared,	1
and	1
Anne	1
might	1
finish	1
her	1
breakfast	1
as	1
she	1
could.	1
"It	1
is	1
over!	1
it	1
is	1
over!"	1
she	1
repeated	1
to	1
herself	1
again	1
and	1
again,	1
in	1
nervous	1
gratitude.	1
"The	1
worst	1
is	1
over!"	1
Mary	1
talked,	1
but	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
attend.	1
She	1
had	1
seen	1
him.	1
They	1
had	1
met.	1
They	1
had	1
been	1
once	1
more	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
room.	1
Soon,	1
however,	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
reason	1
with	1
herself,	1
and	1
try	1
to	1
be	1
feeling	1
less.	1
Eight	1
years,	1
almost	1
eight	1
years	1
had	1
passed,	1
since	1
all	1
had	1
been	1
given	1
up.	1
How	1
absurd	1
to	1
be	1
resuming	1
the	1
agitation	1
which	1
such	1
an	1
interval	1
had	1
banished	1
into	1
distance	1
and	1
indistinctness!	1
What	1
might	1
not	1
eight	1
years	1
do?	1
Events	1
of	1
every	1
description,	1
changes,	1
alienations,	1
removals--all,	1
all	1
must	1
be	1
comprised	1
in	1
it,	1
and	1
oblivion	1
of	1
the	1
past--	1
how	1
natural,	1
how	1
certain	1
too!	1
It	1
included	1
nearly	1
a	1
third	1
part	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
life.	1
Alas!	1
with	1
all	1
her	1
reasoning,	1
she	1
found,	1
that	1
to	1
retentive	1
feelings	1
eight	1
years	1
may	1
be	1
little	1
more	1
than	1
nothing.	1
Now,	1
how	1
were	1
his	1
sentiments	1
to	1
be	1
read?	1
Was	1
this	1
like	1
wishing	1
to	1
avoid	1
her?	1
And	1
the	1
next	1
moment	1
she	1
was	1
hating	1
herself	1
for	1
the	1
folly	1
which	1
asked	1
the	1
question.	1
On	1
one	1
other	1
question	1
which	1
perhaps	1
her	1
utmost	1
wisdom	1
might	1
not	1
have	1
prevented,	1
she	1
was	1
soon	1
spared	1
all	1
suspense;	1
for,	1
after	1
the	1
Miss	1
Musgroves	1
had	1
returned	1
and	1
finished	1
their	1
visit	1
at	1
the	1
Cottage	1
she	1
had	1
this	1
spontaneous	1
information	1
from	1
Mary:	1
--	1
"Captain	1
Wentworth	1
is	1
not	1
very	1
gallant	1
by	1
you,	1
Anne,	1
though	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
attentive	1
to	1
me.	1
Henrietta	1
asked	1
him	1
what	1
he	1
thought	1
of	1
you,	1
when	1
they	1
went	1
away,	1
and	1
he	1
said,	1
`You	1
were	1
so	1
altered	1
he	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
known	1
you	1
again.'"	1
Mary	1
had	1
no	1
feelings	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
respect	1
her	1
sister's	1
in	1
a	1
common	1
way,	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
perfectly	1
unsuspicious	1
of	1
being	1
inflicting	1
any	1
peculiar	1
wound.	1
"Altered	1
beyond	1
his	1
knowledge."	1
Anne	1
fully	1
submitted,	1
in	1
silent,	1
deep	1
mortification.	1
Doubtless	1
it	1
was	1
so,	1
and	1
she	1
could	1
take	1
no	1
revenge,	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
altered,	1
or	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
worse.	1
She	1
had	1
already	1
acknowledged	1
it	1
to	1
herself,	1
and	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
think	1
differently,	1
let	1
him	1
think	1
of	1
her	1
as	1
he	1
would.	1
No:	1
the	1
years	1
which	1
had	1
destroyed	1
her	1
youth	1
and	1
bloom	1
had	1
only	1
given	1
him	1
a	1
more	1
glowing,	1
manly,	1
open	1
look,	1
in	1
no	1
respect	1
lessening	1
his	1
personal	1
advantages.	1
She	1
had	1
seen	1
the	1
same	1
Frederick	1
Wentworth.	1
"So	1
altered	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
known	1
her	1
again!"	1
These	1
were	1
words	1
which	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
dwell	1
with	1
her.	1
Yet	1
she	1
soon	1
began	1
to	1
rejoice	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
heard	1
them.	1
They	1
were	1
of	1
sobering	1
tendency;	1
they	1
allayed	1
agitation;	1
they	1
composed,	1
and	1
consequently	1
must	1
make	1
her	1
happier.	1
Frederick	1
Wentworth	1
had	1
used	1
such	1
words,	1
or	1
something	1
like	1
them,	1
but	1
without	1
an	1
idea	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
be	1
carried	1
round	1
to	1
her.	1
He	1
had	1
thought	1
her	1
wretchedly	1
altered,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
moment	1
of	1
appeal,	1
had	1
spoken	1
as	1
he	1
felt.	1
He	1
had	1
not	1
forgiven	1
Anne	1
Elliot.	1
She	1
had	1
used	1
him	1
ill,	1
deserted	1
and	1
disappointed	1
him;	1
and	1
worse,	1
she	1
had	1
shewn	1
a	1
feebleness	1
of	1
character	1
in	1
doing	1
so,	1
which	1
his	1
own	1
decided,	1
confident	1
temper	1
could	1
not	1
endure.	1
She	1
had	1
given	1
him	1
up	1
to	1
oblige	1
others.	1
It	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
effect	1
of	1
over-persuasion.	1
It	1
had	1
been	1
weakness	1
and	1
timidity.	1
He	1
had	1
been	1
most	1
warmly	1
attached	1
to	1
her,	1
and	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
a	1
woman	1
since	1
whom	1
he	1
thought	1
her	1
equal;	1
but,	1
except	1
from	1
some	1
natural	1
sensation	1
of	1
curiosity,	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
desire	1
of	1
meeting	1
her	1
again.	1
Her	1
power	1
with	1
him	1
was	1
gone	1
for	1
ever.	1
It	1
was	1
now	1
his	1
object	1
to	1
marry.	1
He	1
was	1
rich,	1
and	1
being	1
turned	1
on	1
shore,	1
fully	1
intended	1
to	1
settle	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
be	1
properly	1
tempted;	1
actually	1
looking	1
round,	1
ready	1
to	1
fall	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
speed	1
which	1
a	1
clear	1
head	1
and	1
a	1
quick	1
taste	1
could	1
allow.	1
He	1
had	1
a	1
heart	1
for	1
either	1
of	1
the	1
Miss	1
Musgroves,	1
if	1
they	1
could	1
catch	1
it;	1
a	1
heart,	1
in	1
short,	1
for	1
any	1
pleasing	1
young	1
woman	1
who	1
came	1
in	1
his	1
way,	1
excepting	1
Anne	1
Elliot.	1
This	1
was	1
his	1
only	1
secret	1
exception,	1
when	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
his	1
sister,	1
in	1
answer	1
to	1
her	1
suppositions:--	1
"Yes,	1
here	1
I	1
am,	1
Sophia,	1
quite	1
ready	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
foolish	1
match.	1
Anybody	1
between	1
fifteen	1
and	1
thirty	1
may	1
have	1
me	1
for	1
asking.	1
A	1
little	1
beauty,	1
and	1
a	1
few	1
smiles,	1
and	1
a	1
few	1
compliments	1
to	1
the	1
navy,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
lost	1
man.	1
Should	1
not	1
this	1
be	1
enough	1
for	1
a	1
sailor,	1
who	1
has	1
had	1
no	1
society	1
among	1
women	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
nice?"	1
He	1
said	1
it,	1
she	1
knew,	1
to	1
be	1
contradicted.	1
His	1
bright	1
proud	1
eye	1
spoke	1
the	1
conviction	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
nice;	1
and	1
Anne	1
Elliot	1
was	1
not	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
thoughts,	1
when	1
he	1
more	1
seriously	1
described	1
the	1
woman	1
he	1
should	1
wish	1
to	1
meet	1
with.	1
"A	1
strong	1
mind,	1
with	1
sweetness	1
of	1
manner,"	1
made	1
the	1
first	1
and	1
the	1
last	1
of	1
the	1
description.	1
"That	1
is	1
the	1
woman	1
I	1
want,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"Something	1
a	1
little	1
inferior	1
I	1
shall	1
of	1
course	1
put	1
up	1
with,	1
but	1
it	1
must	1
not	1
be	1
much.	1
If	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
fool,	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
fool	1
indeed,	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
thought	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
more	1
than	1
most	1
men."	1
Chapter	1
8	1
From	1
this	1
time	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
and	1
Anne	1
Elliot	1
were	1
repeatedly	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
circle.	1
They	1
were	1
soon	1
dining	1
in	1
company	1
together	1
at	1
Mr	1
Musgrove's,	1
for	1
the	1
little	1
boy's	1
state	1
could	1
no	1
longer	1
supply	1
his	1
aunt	1
with	1
a	1
pretence	1
for	1
absenting	1
herself;	1
and	1
this	1
was	1
but	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
other	1
dinings	1
and	1
other	1
meetings.	1
Whether	1
former	1
feelings	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
renewed	1
must	1
be	1
brought	1
to	1
the	1
proof;	1
former	1
times	1
must	1
undoubtedly	1
be	1
brought	1
to	1
the	1
recollection	1
of	1
each;	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
be	1
reverted	1
to;	1
the	1
year	1
of	1
their	1
engagement	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
be	1
named	1
by	1
him,	1
in	1
the	1
little	1
narratives	1
or	1
descriptions	1
which	1
conversation	1
called	1
forth.	1
His	1
profession	1
qualified	1
him,	1
his	1
disposition	1
lead	1
him,	1
to	1
talk;	1
and	1
"That	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
year	1
six;"	1
"That	1
happened	1
before	1
I	1
went	1
to	1
sea	1
in	1
the	1
year	1
six,"	1
occurred	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
evening	1
they	1
spent	1
together:	1
and	1
though	1
his	1
voice	1
did	1
not	1
falter,	1
and	1
though	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
reason	1
to	1
suppose	1
his	1
eye	1
wandering	1
towards	1
her	1
while	1
he	1
spoke,	1
Anne	1
felt	1
the	1
utter	1
impossibility,	1
from	1
her	1
knowledge	1
of	1
his	1
mind,	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
be	1
unvisited	1
by	1
remembrance	1
any	1
more	1
than	1
herself.	1
There	1
must	1
be	1
the	1
same	1
immediate	1
association	1
of	1
thought,	1
though	1
she	1
was	1
very	1
far	1
from	1
conceiving	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
equal	1
pain.	1
They	1
had	1
no	1
conversation	1
together,	1
no	1
intercourse	1
but	1
what	1
the	1
commonest	1
civility	1
required.	1
Once	1
so	1
much	1
to	1
each	1
other!	1
Now	1
nothing!	1
There	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
time,	1
when	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
large	1
party	1
now	1
filling	1
the	1
drawing-room	1
at	1
Uppercross,	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
found	1
it	1
most	1
difficult	1
to	1
cease	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
one	1
another.	1
With	1
the	1
exception,	1
perhaps,	1
of	1
Admiral	1
and	1
Mrs	1
Croft,	1
who	1
seemed	1
particularly	1
attached	1
and	1
happy,	1
(Anne	1
could	1
allow	1
no	1
other	1
exceptions	1
even	1
among	1
the	1
married	1
couples),	1
there	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
no	1
two	1
hearts	1
so	1
open,	1
no	1
tastes	1
so	1
similar,	1
no	1
feelings	1
so	1
in	1
unison,	1
no	1
countenances	1
so	1
beloved.	1
Now	1
they	1
were	1
as	1
strangers;	1
nay,	1
worse	1
than	1
strangers,	1
for	1
they	1
could	1
never	1
become	1
acquainted.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
perpetual	1
estrangement.	1
When	1
he	1
talked,	1
she	1
heard	1
the	1
same	1
voice,	1
and	1
discerned	1
the	1
same	1
mind.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
general	1
ignorance	1
of	1
all	1
naval	1
matters	1
throughout	1
the	1
party;	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
much	1
questioned,	1
and	1
especially	1
by	1
the	1
two	1
Miss	1
Musgroves,	1
who	1
seemed	1
hardly	1
to	1
have	1
any	1
eyes	1
but	1
for	1
him,	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
living	1
on	1
board,	1
daily	1
regulations,	1
food,	1
hours,	1
&c.,	1
and	1
their	1
surprise	1
at	1
his	1
accounts,	1
at	1
learning	1
the	1
degree	1
of	1
accommodation	1
and	1
arrangement	1
which	1
was	1
practicable,	1
drew	1
from	1
him	1
some	1
pleasant	1
ridicule,	1
which	1
reminded	1
Anne	1
of	1
the	1
early	1
days	1
when	1
she	1
too	1
had	1
been	1
ignorant,	1
and	1
she	1
too	1
had	1
been	1
accused	1
of	1
supposing	1
sailors	1
to	1
be	1
living	1
on	1
board	1
without	1
anything	1
to	1
eat,	1
or	1
any	1
cook	1
to	1
dress	1
it	1
if	1
there	1
were,	1
or	1
any	1
servant	1
to	1
wait,	1
or	1
any	1
knife	1
and	1
fork	1
to	1
use.	1
From	1
thus	1
listening	1
and	1
thinking,	1
she	1
was	1
roused	1
by	1
a	1
whisper	1
of	1
Mrs	1
Musgrove's	1
who,	1
overcome	1
by	1
fond	1
regrets,	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
saying--	1
"Ah!	1
Miss	1
Anne,	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
pleased	1
Heaven	1
to	1
spare	1
my	1
poor	1
son,	1
I	1
dare	1
say	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
just	1
such	1
another	1
by	1
this	1
time."	1
Anne	1
suppressed	1
a	1
smile,	1
and	1
listened	1
kindly,	1
while	1
Mrs	1
Musgrove	1
relieved	1
her	1
heart	1
a	1
little	1
more;	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
minutes,	1
therefore,	1
could	1
not	1
keep	1
pace	1
with	1
the	1
conversation	1
of	1
the	1
others.	1
When	1
she	1
could	1
let	1
her	1
attention	1
take	1
its	1
natural	1
course	1
again,	1
she	1
found	1
the	1
Miss	1
Musgroves	1
just	1
fetching	1
the	1
Navy	1
List	1
(their	1
own	1
navy	1
list,	1
the	1
first	1
that	1
had	1
ever	1
been	1
at	1
Uppercross),	1
and	1
sitting	1
down	1
together	1
to	1
pore	1
over	1
it,	1
with	1
the	1
professed	1
view	1
of	1
finding	1
out	1
the	1
ships	1
that	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
had	1
commanded.	1
"Your	1
first	1
was	1
the	1
Asp,	1
I	1
remember;	1
we	1
will	1
look	1
for	1
the	1
Asp."	1
"You	1
will	1
not	1
find	1
her	1
there.	1
Quite	1
worn	1
out	1
and	1
broken	1
up.	1
I	1
was	1
the	1
last	1
man	1
who	1
commanded	1
her.	1
Hardly	1
fit	1
for	1
service	1
then.	1
Reported	1
fit	1
for	1
home	1
service	1
for	1
a	1
year	1
or	1
two,	1
and	1
so	1
I	1
was	1
sent	1
off	1
to	1
the	1
West	1
Indies."	1
The	1
girls	1
looked	1
all	1
amazement.	1
"The	1
Admiralty,"	1
he	1
continued,	1
"entertain	1
themselves	1
now	1
and	1
then,	1
with	1
sending	1
a	1
few	1
hundred	1
men	1
to	1
sea,	1
in	1
a	1
ship	1
not	1
fit	1
to	1
be	1
employed.	1
But	1
they	1
have	1
a	1
great	1
many	1
to	1
provide	1
for;	1
and	1
among	1
the	1
thousands	1
that	1
may	1
just	1
as	1
well	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
bottom	1
as	1
not,	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
for	1
them	1
to	1
distinguish	1
the	1
very	1
set	1
who	1
may	1
be	1
least	1
missed."	1
"Phoo!	1
phoo!"	1
cried	1
the	1
Admiral,	1
"what	1
stuff	1
these	1
young	1
fellows	1
talk!	1
Never	1
was	1
a	1
better	1
sloop	1
than	1
the	1
Asp	1
in	1
her	1
day.	1
For	1
an	1
old	1
built	1
sloop,	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
see	1
her	1
equal.	1
Lucky	1
fellow	1
to	1
get	1
her!	1
He	1
knows	1
there	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
twenty	1
better	1
men	1
than	1
himself	1
applying	1
for	1
her	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time.	1
Lucky	1
fellow	1
to	1
get	1
anything	1
so	1
soon,	1
with	1
no	1
more	1
interest	1
than	1
his."	1
"I	1
felt	1
my	1
luck,	1
Admiral,	1
I	1
assure	1
you;"	1
replied	1
Captain	1
Wentworth,	1
seriously.	1
"I	1
was	1
as	1
well	1
satisfied	1
with	1
my	1
appointment	1
as	1
you	1
can	1
desire.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
object	1
with	1
me	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
sea;	1
a	1
very	1
great	1
object,	1
I	1
wanted	1
to	1
be	1
doing	1
something."	1
"To	1
be	1
sure	1
you	1
did.	1
What	1
should	1
a	1
young	1
fellow	1
like	1
you	1
do	1
ashore	1
for	1
half	1
a	1
year	1
together?	1
If	1
a	1
man	1
had	1
not	1
a	1
wife,	1
he	1
soon	1
wants	1
to	1
be	1
afloat	1
again."	1
"But,	1
Captain	1
Wentworth,"	1
cried	1
Louisa,	1
"how	1
vexed	1
you	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
when	1
you	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
Asp,	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
an	1
old	1
thing	1
they	1
had	1
given	1
you."	1
"I	1
knew	1
pretty	1
well	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
before	1
that	1
day;"	1
said	1
he,	1
smiling.	1
"I	1
had	1
no	1
more	1
discoveries	1
to	1
make	1
than	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
fashion	1
and	1
strength	1
of	1
any	1
old	1
pelisse,	1
which	1
you	1
had	1
seen	1
lent	1
about	1
among	1
half	1
your	1
acquaintance	1
ever	1
since	1
you	1
could	1
remember,	1
and	1
which	1
at	1
last,	1
on	1
some	1
very	1
wet	1
day,	1
is	1
lent	1
to	1
yourself.	1
Ah!	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
dear	1
old	1
Asp	1
to	1
me.	1
She	1
did	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
wanted.	1
I	1
knew	1
she	1
would.	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
either	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
bottom	1
together,	1
or	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
making	1
of	1
me;	1
and	1
I	1
never	1
had	1
two	1
days	1
of	1
foul	1
weather	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
I	1
was	1
at	1
sea	1
in	1
her;	1
and	1
after	1
taking	1
privateers	1
enough	1
to	1
be	1
very	1
entertaining,	1
I	1
had	1
the	1
good	1
luck	1
in	1
my	1
passage	1
home	1
the	1
next	1
autumn,	1
to	1
fall	1
in	1
with	1
the	1
very	1
French	1
frigate	1
I	1
wanted.	1
I	1
brought	1
her	1
into	1
Plymouth;	1
and	1
here	1
another	1
instance	1
of	1
luck.	1
We	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
six	1
hours	1
in	1
the	1
Sound,	1
when	1
a	1
gale	1
came	1
on,	1
which	1
lasted	1
four	1
days	1
and	1
nights,	1
and	1
which	1
would	1
have	1
done	1
for	1
poor	1
old	1
Asp	1
in	1
half	1
the	1
time;	1
our	1
touch	1
with	1
the	1
Great	1
Nation	1
not	1
having	1
much	1
improved	1
our	1
condition.	1
Four-and-twenty	1
hours	1
later,	1
and	1
I	1
should	1
only	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
gallant	1
Captain	1
Wentworth,	1
in	1
a	1
small	1
paragraph	1
at	1
one	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
newspapers;	1
and	1
being	1
lost	1
in	1
only	1
a	1
sloop,	1
nobody	1
would	1
have	1
thought	1
about	1
me."	1
Anne's	1
shudderings	1
were	1
to	1
herself	1
alone;	1
but	1
the	1
Miss	1
Musgroves	1
could	1
be	1
as	1
open	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
sincere,	1
in	1
their	1
exclamations	1
of	1
pity	1
and	1
horror.	1
"And	1
so	1
then,	1
I	1
suppose,"	1
said	1
Mrs	1
Musgrove,	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice,	1
as	1
if	1
thinking	1
aloud,	1
"so	1
then	1
he	1
went	1
away	1
to	1
the	1
Laconia,	1
and	1
there	1
he	1
met	1
with	1
our	1
poor	1
boy.	1
Charles,	1
my	1
dear,"	1
(beckoning	1
him	1
to	1
her),	1
"do	1
ask	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
where	1
it	1
was	1
he	1
first	1
met	1
with	1
your	1
poor	1
brother.	1
I	1
always	1
forgot."	1
"It	1
was	1
at	1
Gibraltar,	1
mother,	1
I	1
know.	1
Dick	1
had	1
been	1
left	1
ill	1
at	1
Gibraltar,	1
with	1
a	1
recommendation	1
from	1
his	1
former	1
captain	1
to	1
Captain	1
Wentworth."	1
"Oh!	1
but,	1
Charles,	1
tell	1
Captain	1
Wentworth,	1
he	1
need	1
not	1
be	1
afraid	1
of	1
mentioning	1
poor	1
Dick	1
before	1
me,	1
for	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
rather	1
a	1
pleasure	1
to	1
hear	1
him	1
talked	1
of	1
by	1
such	1
a	1
good	1
friend."	1
Charles,	1
being	1
somewhat	1
more	1
mindful	1
of	1
the	1
probabilities	1
of	1
the	1
case,	1
only	1
nodded	1
in	1
reply,	1
and	1
walked	1
away.	1
The	1
girls	1
were	1
now	1
hunting	1
for	1
the	1
Laconia;	1
and	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
could	1
not	1
deny	1
himself	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
taking	1
the	1
precious	1
volume	1
into	1
his	1
own	1
hands	1
to	1
save	1
them	1
the	1
trouble,	1
and	1
once	1
more	1
read	1
aloud	1
the	1
little	1
statement	1
of	1
her	1
name	1
and	1
rate,	1
and	1
present	1
non-commissioned	1
class,	1
observing	1
over	1
it	1
that	1
she	1
too	1
had	1
been	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
friends	1
man	1
ever	1
had.	1
"Ah!	1
those	1
were	1
pleasant	1
days	1
when	1
I	1
had	1
the	1
Laconia!	1
How	1
fast	1
I	1
made	1
money	1
in	1
her.	1
A	1
friend	1
of	1
mine	1
and	1
I	1
had	1
such	1
a	1
lovely	1
cruise	1
together	1
off	1
the	1
Western	1
Islands.	1
Poor	1
Harville,	1
sister!	1
You	1
know	1
how	1
much	1
he	1
wanted	1
money:	1
worse	1
than	1
myself.	1
He	1
had	1
a	1
wife.	1
Excellent	1
fellow.	1
I	1
shall	1
never	1
forget	1
his	1
happiness.	1
He	1
felt	1
it	1
all,	1
so	1
much	1
for	1
her	1
sake.	1
I	1
wished	1
for	1
him	1
again	1
the	1
next	1
summer,	1
when	1
I	1
had	1
still	1
the	1
same	1
luck	1
in	1
the	1
Mediterranean."	1
"And	1
I	1
am	1
sure,	1
Sir."	1
said	1
Mrs	1
Musgrove,	1
"it	1
was	1
a	1
lucky	1
day	1
for	1
us,	1
when	1
you	1
were	1
put	1
captain	1
into	1
that	1
ship.	1
We	1
shall	1
never	1
forget	1
what	1
you	1
did."	1
Her	1
feelings	1
made	1
her	1
speak	1
low;	1
and	1
Captain	1
Wentworth,	1
hearing	1
only	1
in	1
part,	1
and	1
probably	1
not	1
having	1
Dick	1
Musgrove	1
at	1
all	1
near	1
his	1
thoughts,	1
looked	1
rather	1
in	1
suspense,	1
and	1
as	1
if	1
waiting	1
for	1
more.	1
"My	1
brother,"	1
whispered	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
girls;	1
"mamma	1
is	1
thinking	1
of	1
poor	1
Richard."	1
"Poor	1
dear	1
fellow!"	1
continued	1
Mrs	1
Musgrove;	1
"he	1
was	1
grown	1
so	1
steady,	1
and	1
such	1
an	1
excellent	1
correspondent,	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
under	1
your	1
care!	1
Ah!	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
happy	1
thing,	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
left	1
you.	1
I	1
assure	1
you,	1
Captain	1
Wentworth,	1
we	1
are	1
very	1
sorry	1
he	1
ever	1
left	1
you."	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
momentary	1
expression	1
in	1
Captain	1
Wentworth's	1
face	1
at	1
this	1
speech,	1
a	1
certain	1
glance	1
of	1
his	1
bright	1
eye,	1
and	1
curl	1
of	1
his	1
handsome	1
mouth,	1
which	1
convinced	1
Anne,	1
that	1
instead	1
of	1
sharing	1
in	1
Mrs	1
Musgrove's	1
kind	1
wishes,	1
as	1
to	1
her	1
son,	1
he	1
had	1
probably	1
been	1
at	1
some	1
pains	1
to	1
get	1
rid	1
of	1
him;	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
too	1
transient	1
an	1
indulgence	1
of	1
self-amusement	1
to	1
be	1
detected	1
by	1
any	1
who	1
understood	1
him	1
less	1
than	1
herself;	1
in	1
another	1
moment	1
he	1
was	1
perfectly	1
collected	1
and	1
serious,	1
and	1
almost	1
instantly	1
afterwards	1
coming	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
sofa,	1
on	1
which	1
she	1
and	1
Mrs	1
Musgrove	1
were	1
sitting,	1
took	1
a	1
place	1
by	1
the	1
latter,	1
and	1
entered	1
into	1
conversation	1
with	1
her,	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice,	1
about	1
her	1
son,	1
doing	1
it	1
with	1
so	1
much	1
sympathy	1
and	1
natural	1
grace,	1
as	1
shewed	1
the	1
kindest	1
consideration	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
real	1
and	1
unabsurd	1
in	1
the	1
parent's	1
feelings.	1
They	1
were	1
actually	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
sofa,	1
for	1
Mrs	1
Musgrove	1
had	1
most	1
readily	1
made	1
room	1
for	1
him;	1
they	1
were	1
divided	1
only	1
by	1
Mrs	1
Musgrove.	1
It	1
was	1
no	1
insignificant	1
barrier,	1
indeed.	1
Mrs	1
Musgrove	1
was	1
of	1
a	1
comfortable,	1
substantial	1
size,	1
infinitely	1
more	1
fitted	1
by	1
nature	1
to	1
express	1
good	1
cheer	1
and	1
good	1
humour,	1
than	1
tenderness	1
and	1
sentiment;	1
and	1
while	1
the	1
agitations	1
of	1
Anne's	1
slender	1
form,	1
and	1
pensive	1
face,	1
may	1
be	1
considered	1
as	1
very	1
completely	1
screened,	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
should	1
be	1
allowed	1
some	1
credit	1
for	1
the	1
self-command	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
attended	1
to	1
her	1
large	1
fat	1
sighings	1
over	1
the	1
destiny	1
of	1
a	1
son,	1
whom	1
alive	1
nobody	1
had	1
cared	1
for.	1
Personal	1
size	1
and	1
mental	1
sorrow	1
have	1
certainly	1
no	1
necessary	1
proportions.	1
A	1
large	1
bulky	1
figure	1
has	1
as	1
good	1
a	1
right	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
deep	1
affliction,	1
as	1
the	1
most	1
graceful	1
set	1
of	1
limbs	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
But,	1
fair	1
or	1
not	1
fair,	1
there	1
are	1
unbecoming	1
conjunctions,	1
which	1
reason	1
will	1
patronize	1
in	1
vain--	1
which	1
taste	1
cannot	1
tolerate--which	1
ridicule	1
will	1
seize.	1
The	1
Admiral,	1
after	1
taking	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
refreshing	1
turns	1
about	1
the	1
room	1
with	1
his	1
hands	1
behind	1
him,	1
being	1
called	1
to	1
order	1
by	1
his	1
wife,	1
now	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
Captain	1
Wentworth,	1
and	1
without	1
any	1
observation	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
interrupting,	1
thinking	1
only	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
thoughts,	1
began	1
with--	1
"If	1
you	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
week	1
later	1
at	1
Lisbon,	1
last	1
spring,	1
Frederick,	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
asked	1
to	1
give	1
a	1
passage	1
to	1
Lady	1
Mary	1
Grierson	1
and	1
her	1
daughters."	1
"Should	1
I?	1
I	1
am	1
glad	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
week	1
later	1
then."	1
The	1
Admiral	1
abused	1
him	1
for	1
his	1
want	1
of	1
gallantry.	1
He	1
defended	1
himself;	1
though	1
professing	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
never	1
willingly	1
admit	1
any	1
ladies	1
on	1
board	1
a	1
ship	1
of	1
his,	1
excepting	1
for	1
a	1
ball,	1
or	1
a	1
visit,	1
which	1
a	1
few	1
hours	1
might	1
comprehend.	1
"But,	1
if	1
I	1
know	1
myself,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"this	1
is	1
from	1
no	1
want	1
of	1
gallantry	1
towards	1
them.	1
It	1
is	1
rather	1
from	1
feeling	1
how	1
impossible	1
it	1
is,	1
with	1
all	1
one's	1
efforts,	1
and	1
all	1
one's	1
sacrifices,	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
accommodations	1
on	1
board	1
such	1
as	1
women	1
ought	1
to	1
have.	1
There	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
want	1
of	1
gallantry,	1
Admiral,	1
in	1
rating	1
the	1
claims	1
of	1
women	1
to	1
every	1
personal	1
comfort	1
high,	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
what	1
I	1
do.	1
I	1
hate	1
to	1
hear	1
of	1
women	1
on	1
board,	1
or	1
to	1
see	1
them	1
on	1
board;	1
and	1
no	1
ship	1
under	1
my	1
command	1
shall	1
ever	1
convey	1
a	1
family	1
of	1
ladies	1
anywhere,	1
if	1
I	1
can	1
help	1
it."	1
This	1
brought	1
his	1
sister	1
upon	1
him.	1
"Oh!	1
Frederick!	1
But	1
I	1
cannot	1
believe	1
it	1
of	1
you.	1
--All	1
idle	1
refinement!	1
--Women	1
may	1
be	1
as	1
comfortable	1
on	1
board,	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
best	1
house	1
in	1
England.	1
I	1
believe	1
I	1
have	1
lived	1
as	1
much	1
on	1
board	1
as	1
most	1
women,	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
nothing	1
superior	1
to	1
the	1
accommodations	1
of	1
a	1
man-of-war.	1
I	1
declare	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
a	1
comfort	1
or	1
an	1
indulgence	1
about	1
me,	1
even	1
at	1
Kellynch	1
Hall,"	1
(with	1
a	1
kind	1
bow	1
to	1
Anne),	1
"beyond	1
what	1
I	1
always	1
had	1
in	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
ships	1
I	1
have	1
lived	1
in;	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
been	1
five	1
altogether."	1
"Nothing	1
to	1
the	1
purpose,"	1
replied	1
her	1
brother.	1
"You	1
were	1
living	1
with	1
your	1
husband,	1
and	1
were	1
the	1
only	1
woman	1
on	1
board."	1
"But	1
you,	1
yourself,	1
brought	1
Mrs	1
Harville,	1
her	1
sister,	1
her	1
cousin,	1
and	1
three	1
children,	1
round	1
from	1
Portsmouth	1
to	1
Plymouth.	1
Where	1
was	1
this	1
superfine,	1
extraordinary	1
sort	1
of	1
gallantry	1
of	1
yours	1
then?"	1
"All	1
merged	1
in	1
my	1
friendship,	1
Sophia.	1
I	1
would	1
assist	1
any	1
brother	1
officer's	1
wife	1
that	1
I	1
could,	1
and	1
I	1
would	1
bring	1
anything	1
of	1
Harville's	1
from	1
the	1
world's	1
end,	1
if	1
he	1
wanted	1
it.	1
But	1
do	1
not	1
imagine	1
that	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
feel	1
it	1
an	1
evil	1
in	1
itself."	1
"Depend	1
upon	1
it,	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
perfectly	1
comfortable."	1
"I	1
might	1
not	1
like	1
them	1
the	1
better	1
for	1
that	1
perhaps.	1
Such	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
women	1
and	1
children	1
have	1
no	1
right	1
to	1
be	1
comfortable	1
on	1
board."	1
"My	1
dear	1
Frederick,	1
you	1
are	1
talking	1
quite	1
idly.	1
Pray,	1
what	1
would	1
become	1
of	1
us	1
poor	1
sailors'	1
wives,	1
who	1
often	1
want	1
to	1
be	1
conveyed	1
to	1
one	1
port	1
or	1
another,	1
after	1
our	1
husbands,	1
if	1
everybody	1
had	1
your	1
feelings?"	1
"My	1
feelings,	1
you	1
see,	1
did	1
not	1
prevent	1
my	1
taking	1
Mrs	1
Harville	1
and	1
all	1
her	1
family	1
to	1
Plymouth."	1
"But	1
I	1
hate	1
to	1
hear	1
you	1
talking	1
so	1
like	1
a	1
fine	1
gentleman,	1
and	1
as	1
if	1
women	1
were	1
all	1
fine	1
ladies,	1
instead	1
of	1
rational	1
creatures.	1
We	1
none	1
of	1
us	1
expect	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
smooth	1
water	1
all	1
our	1
days."	1
"Ah!	1
my	1
dear,"	1
said	1
the	1
Admiral,	1
"when	1
he	1
had	1
got	1
a	1
wife,	1
he	1
will	1
sing	1
a	1
different	1
tune.	1
When	1
he	1
is	1
married,	1
if	1
we	1
have	1
the	1
good	1
luck	1
to	1
live	1
to	1
another	1
war,	1
we	1
shall	1
see	1
him	1
do	1
as	1
you	1
and	1
I,	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
many	1
others,	1
have	1
done.	1
We	1
shall	1
have	1
him	1
very	1
thankful	1
to	1
anybody	1
that	1
will	1
bring	1
him	1
his	1
wife."	1
"Ay,	1
that	1
we	1
shall."	1
"Now	1
I	1
have	1
done,"	1
cried	1
Captain	1
Wentworth.	1
"When	1
once	1
married	1
people	1
begin	1
to	1
attack	1
me	1
with,--`Oh!	1
you	1
will	1
think	1
very	1
differently,	1
when	1
you	1
are	1
married.'	1
I	1
can	1
only	1
say,	1
`No,	1
I	1
shall	1
not;'	1
and	1
then	1
they	1
say	1
again,	1
`Yes,	1
you	1
will,'	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
it."	1
He	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
moved	1
away.	1
"What	1
a	1
great	1
traveller	1
you	1
must	1
have	1
been,	1
ma'am!"	1
said	1
Mrs	1
Musgrove	1
to	1
Mrs	1
Croft.	1
"Pretty	1
well,	1
ma'am	1
in	1
the	1
fifteen	1
years	1
of	1
my	1
marriage;	1
though	1
many	1
women	1
have	1
done	1
more.	1
I	1
have	1
crossed	1
the	1
Atlantic	1
four	1
times,	1
and	1
have	1
been	1
once	1
to	1
the	1
East	1
Indies,	1
and	1
back	1
again,	1
and	1
only	1
once;	1
besides	1
being	1
in	1
different	1
places	1
about	1
home:	1
Cork,	1
and	1
Lisbon,	1
and	1
Gibraltar.	1
But	1
I	1
never	1
went	1
beyond	1
the	1
Streights,	1
and	1
never	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
West	1
Indies.	1
We	1
do	1
not	1
call	1
Bermuda	1
or	1
Bahama,	1
you	1
know,	1
the	1
West	1
Indies."	1
Mrs	1
Musgrove	1
had	1
not	1
a	1
word	1
to	1
say	1
in	1
dissent;	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
accuse	1
herself	1
of	1
having	1
ever	1
called	1
them	1
anything	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
course	1
of	1
her	1
life.	1
"And	1
I	1
do	1
assure	1
you,	1
ma'am,"	1
pursued	1
Mrs	1
Croft,	1
"that	1
nothing	1
can	1
exceed	1
the	1
accommodations	1
of	1
a	1
man-of-war;	1
I	1
speak,	1
you	1
know,	1
of	1
the	1
higher	1
rates.	1
When	1
you	1
come	1
to	1
a	1
frigate,	1
of	1
course,	1
you	1
are	1
more	1
confined;	1
though	1
any	1
reasonable	1
woman	1
may	1
be	1
perfectly	1
happy	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
them;	1
and	1
I	1
can	1
safely	1
say,	1
that	1
the	1
happiest	1
part	1
of	1
my	1
life	1
has	1
been	1
spent	1
on	1
board	1
a	1
ship.	1
While	1
we	1
were	1
together,	1
you	1
know,	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
to	1
be	1
feared.	1
Thank	1
God!	1
I	1
have	1
always	1
been	1
blessed	1
with	1
excellent	1
health,	1
and	1
no	1
climate	1
disagrees	1
with	1
me.	1
A	1
little	1
disordered	1
always	1
the	1
first	1
twenty-four	1
hours	1
of	1
going	1
to	1
sea,	1
but	1
never	1
knew	1
what	1
sickness	1
was	1
afterwards.	1
The	1
only	1
time	1
I	1
ever	1
really	1
suffered	1
in	1
body	1
or	1
mind,	1
the	1
only	1
time	1
that	1
I	1
ever	1
fancied	1
myself	1
unwell,	1
or	1
had	1
any	1
ideas	1
of	1
danger,	1
was	1
the	1
winter	1
that	1
I	1
passed	1
by	1
myself	1
at	1
Deal,	1
when	1
the	1
Admiral	1
(Captain	1
Croft	1
then)	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
North	1
Seas.	1
I	1
lived	1
in	1
perpetual	1
fright	1
at	1
that	1
time,	1
and	1
had	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
imaginary	1
complaints	1
from	1
not	1
knowing	1
what	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
myself,	1
or	1
when	1
I	1
should	1
hear	1
from	1
him	1
next;	1
but	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
we	1
could	1
be	1
together,	1
nothing	1
ever	1
ailed	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
never	1
met	1
with	1
the	1
smallest	1
inconvenience."	1
"Aye,	1
to	1
be	1
sure.	1
Yes,	1
indeed,	1
oh	1
yes!	1
I	1
am	1
quite	1
of	1
your	1
opinion,	1
Mrs	1
Croft,"	1
was	1
Mrs	1
Musgrove's	1
hearty	1
answer.	1
"There	1
is	1
nothing	1
so	1
bad	1
as	1
a	1
separation.	1
I	1
am	1
quite	1
of	1
your	1
opinion.	1
I	1
know	1
what	1
it	1
is,	1
for	1
Mr	1
Musgrove	1
always	1
attends	1
the	1
assizes,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
so	1
glad	1
when	1
they	1
are	1
over,	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
safe	1
back	1
again."	1
The	1
evening	1
ended	1
with	1
dancing.	1
On	1
its	1
being	1
proposed,	1
Anne	1
offered	1
her	1
services,	1
as	1
usual;	1
and	1
though	1
her	1
eyes	1
would	1
sometimes	1
fill	1
with	1
tears	1
as	1
she	1
sat	1
at	1
the	1
instrument,	1
she	1
was	1
extremely	1
glad	1
to	1
be	1
employed,	1
and	1
desired	1
nothing	1
in	1
return	1
but	1
to	1
be	1
unobserved.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
merry,	1
joyous	1
party,	1
and	1
no	1
one	1
seemed	1
in	1
higher	1
spirits	1
than	1
Captain	1
Wentworth.	1
She	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
every	1
thing	1
to	1
elevate	1
him	1
which	1
general	1
attention	1
and	1
deference,	1
and	1
especially	1
the	1
attention	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
young	1
women,	1
could	1
do.	1
The	1
Miss	1
Hayters,	1
the	1
females	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
of	1
cousins	1
already	1
mentioned,	1
were	1
apparently	1
admitted	1
to	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
being	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
him;	1
and	1
as	1
for	1
Henrietta	1
and	1
Louisa,	1
they	1
both	1
seemed	1
so	1
entirely	1
occupied	1
by	1
him,	1
that	1
nothing	1
but	1
the	1
continued	1
appearance	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
perfect	1
good-will	1
between	1
themselves	1
could	1
have	1
made	1
it	1
credible	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
decided	1
rivals.	1
If	1
he	1
were	1
a	1
little	1
spoilt	1
by	1
such	1
universal,	1
such	1
eager	1
admiration,	1
who	1
could	1
wonder?	1
These	1
were	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
thoughts	1
which	1
occupied	1
Anne,	1
while	1
her	1
fingers	1
were	1
mechanically	1
at	1
work,	1
proceeding	1
for	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
together,	1
equally	1
without	1
error,	1
and	1
without	1
consciousness.	1
Once	1
she	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
looking	1
at	1
herself,	1
observing	1
her	1
altered	1
features,	1
perhaps,	1
trying	1
to	1
trace	1
in	1
them	1
the	1
ruins	1
of	1
the	1
face	1
which	1
had	1
once	1
charmed	1
him;	1
and	1
once	1
she	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
spoken	1
of	1
her;	1
she	1
was	1
hardly	1
aware	1
of	1
it,	1
till	1
she	1
heard	1
the	1
answer;	1
but	1
then	1
she	1
was	1
sure	1
of	1
his	1
having	1
asked	1
his	1
partner	1
whether	1
Miss	1
Elliot	1
never	1
danced?	1
The	1
answer	1
was,	1
"Oh,	1
no;	1
never;	1
she	1
has	1
quite	1
given	1
up	1
dancing.	1
She	1
had	1
rather	1
play.	1
She	1
is	1
never	1
tired	1
of	1
playing."	1
Once,	1
too,	1
he	1
spoke	1
to	1
her.	1
She	1
had	1
left	1
the	1
instrument	1
on	1
the	1
dancing	1
being	1
over,	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
sat	1
down	1
to	1
try	1
to	1
make	1
out	1
an	1
air	1
which	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
Miss	1
Musgroves	1
an	1
idea	1
of.	1
Unintentionally	1
she	1
returned	1
to	1
that	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
room;	1
he	1
saw	1
her,	1
and,	1
instantly	1
rising,	1
said,	1
with	1
studied	1
politeness--	1
"I	1
beg	1
your	1
pardon,	1
madam,	1
this	1
is	1
your	1
seat;"	1
and	1
though	1
she	1
immediately	1
drew	1
back	1
with	1
a	1
decided	1
negative,	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
induced	1
to	1
sit	1
down	1
again.	1
Anne	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
for	1
more	1
of	1
such	1
looks	1
and	1
speeches.	1
His	1
cold	1
politeness,	1
his	1
ceremonious	1
grace,	1
were	1
worse	1
than	1
anything.	1
Chapter	1
9	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
was	1
come	1
to	1
Kellynch	1
as	1
to	1
a	1
home,	1
to	1
stay	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
he	1
liked,	1
being	1
as	1
thoroughly	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
the	1
Admiral's	1
fraternal	1
kindness	1
as	1
of	1
his	1
wife's.	1
He	1
had	1
intended,	1
on	1
first	1
arriving,	1
to	1
proceed	1
very	1
soon	1
into	1
Shropshire,	1
and	1
visit	1
the	1
brother	1
settled	1
in	1
that	1
country,	1
but	1
the	1
attractions	1
of	1
Uppercross	1
induced	1
him	1
to	1
put	1
this	1
off.	1
There	1
was	1
so	1
much	1
of	1
friendliness,	1
and	1
of	1
flattery,	1
and	1
of	1
everything	1
most	1
bewitching	1
in	1
his	1
reception	1
there;	1
the	1
old	1
were	1
so	1
hospitable,	1
the	1
young	1
so	1
agreeable,	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
resolve	1
to	1
remain	1
where	1
he	1
was,	1
and	1
take	1
all	1
the	1
charms	1
and	1
perfections	1
of	1
Edward's	1
wife	1
upon	1
credit	1
a	1
little	1
longer.	1
It	1
was	1
soon	1
Uppercross	1
with	1
him	1
almost	1
every	1
day.	1
The	1
Musgroves	1
could	1
hardly	1
be	1
more	1
ready	1
to	1
invite	1
than	1
he	1
to	1
come,	1
particularly	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
companion	1
at	1
home,	1
for	1
the	1
Admiral	1
and	1
Mrs	1
Croft	1
were	1
generally	1
out	1
of	1
doors	1
together,	1
interesting	1
themselves	1
in	1
their	1
new	1
possessions,	1
their	1
grass,	1
and	1
their	1
sheep,	1
and	1
dawdling	1
about	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
not	1
endurable	1
to	1
a	1
third	1
person,	1
or	1
driving	1
out	1
in	1
a	1
gig,	1
lately	1
added	1
to	1
their	1
establishment.	1
Hitherto	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
but	1
one	1
opinion	1
of	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
among	1
the	1
Musgroves	1
and	1
their	1
dependencies.	1
It	1
was	1
unvarying,	1
warm	1
admiration	1
everywhere;	1
but	1
this	1
intimate	1
footing	1
was	1
not	1
more	1
than	1
established,	1
when	1
a	1
certain	1
Charles	1
Hayter	1
returned	1
among	1
them,	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
disturbed	1
by	1
it,	1
and	1
to	1
think	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
very	1
much	1
in	1
the	1
way.	1
Charles	1
Hayter	1
was	1
the	1
eldest	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
cousins,	1
and	1
a	1
very	1
amiable,	1
pleasing	1
young	1
man,	1
between	1
whom	1
and	1
Henrietta	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
considerable	1
appearance	1
of	1
attachment	1
previous	1
to	1
Captain	1
Wentworth's	1
introduction.	1
He	1
was	1
in	1
orders;	1
and	1
having	1
a	1
curacy	1
in	1
the	1
neighbourhood,	1
where	1
residence	1
was	1
not	1
required,	1
lived	1
at	1
his	1
father's	1
house,	1
only	1
two	1
miles	1
from	1
Uppercross.	1
A	1
short	1
absence	1
from	1
home	1
had	1
left	1
his	1
fair	1
one	1
unguarded	1
by	1
his	1
attentions	1
at	1
this	1
critical	1
period,	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
back	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
pain	1
of	1
finding	1
very	1
altered	1
manners,	1
and	1
of	1
seeing	1
Captain	1
Wentworth.	1
Mrs	1
Musgrove	1
and	1
Mrs	1
Hayter	1
were	1
sisters.	1
They	1
had	1
each	1
had	1
money,	1
but	1
their	1
marriages	1
had	1
made	1
a	1
material	1
difference	1
in	1
their	1
degree	1
of	1
consequence.	1
Mr	1
Hayter	1
had	1
some	1
property	1
of	1
his	1
own,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
insignificant	1
compared	1
with	1
Mr	1
Musgrove's;	1
and	1
while	1
the	1
Musgroves	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
class	1
of	1
society	1
in	1
the	1
country,	1
the	1
young	1
Hayters	1
would,	1
from	1
their	1
parents'	1
inferior,	1
retired,	1
and	1
unpolished	1
way	1
of	1
living,	1
and	1
their	1
own	1
defective	1
education,	1
have	1
been	1
hardly	1
in	1
any	1
class	1
at	1
all,	1
but	1
for	1
their	1
connexion	1
with	1
Uppercross,	1
this	1
eldest	1
son	1
of	1
course	1
excepted,	1
who	1
had	1
chosen	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
scholar	1
and	1
a	1
gentleman,	1
and	1
who	1
was	1
very	1
superior	1
in	1
cultivation	1
and	1
manners	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
rest.	1
The	1
two	1
families	1
had	1
always	1
been	1
on	1
excellent	1
terms,	1
there	1
being	1
no	1
pride	1
on	1
one	1
side,	1
and	1
no	1
envy	1
on	1
the	1
other,	1
and	1
only	1
such	1
a	1
consciousness	1
of	1
superiority	1
in	1
the	1
Miss	1
Musgroves,	1
as	1
made	1
them	1
pleased	1
to	1
improve	1
their	1
cousins.	1
Charles's	1
attentions	1
to	1
Henrietta	1
had	1
been	1
observed	1
by	1
her	1
father	1
and	1
mother	1
without	1
any	1
disapprobation.	1
"It	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
a	1
great	1
match	1
for	1
her;	1
but	1
if	1
Henrietta	1
liked	1
him,"--	1
and	1
Henrietta	1
did	1
seem	1
to	1
like	1
him.	1
Henrietta	1
fully	1
thought	1
so	1
herself,	1
before	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
came;	1
but	1
from	1
that	1
time	1
Cousin	1
Charles	1
had	1
been	1
very	1
much	1
forgotten.	1
Which	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
sisters	1
was	1
preferred	1
by	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
was	1
as	1
yet	1
quite	1
doubtful,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
Anne's	1
observation	1
reached.	1
Henrietta	1
was	1
perhaps	1
the	1
prettiest,	1
Louisa	1
had	1
the	1
higher	1
spirits;	1
and	1
she	1
knew	1
not	1
now,	1
whether	1
the	1
more	1
gentle	1
or	1
the	1
more	1
lively	1
character	1
were	1
most	1
likely	1
to	1
attract	1
him.	1
Mr	1
and	1
Mrs	1
Musgrove,	1
either	1
from	1
seeing	1
little,	1
or	1
from	1
an	1
entire	1
confidence	1
in	1
the	1
discretion	1
of	1
both	1
their	1
daughters,	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
who	1
came	1
near	1
them,	1
seemed	1
to	1
leave	1
everything	1
to	1
take	1
its	1
chance.	1
There	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
smallest	1
appearance	1
of	1
solicitude	1
or	1
remark	1
about	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
Mansion-house;	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
different	1
at	1
the	1
Cottage:	1
the	1
young	1
couple	1
there	1
were	1
more	1
disposed	1
to	1
speculate	1
and	1
wonder;	1
and	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
above	1
four	1
or	1
five	1
times	1
in	1
the	1
Miss	1
Musgroves'	1
company,	1
and	1
Charles	1
Hayter	1
had	1
but	1
just	1
reappeared,	1
when	1
Anne	1
had	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
the	1
opinions	1
of	1
her	1
brother	1
and	1
sister,	1
as	1
to	1
which	1
was	1
the	1
one	1
liked	1
best.	1
Charles	1
gave	1
it	1
for	1
Louisa,	1
Mary	1
for	1
Henrietta,	1
but	1
quite	1
agreeing	1
that	1
to	1
have	1
him	1
marry	1
either	1
could	1
be	1
extremely	1
delightful.	1
Charles	1
"had	1
never	1
seen	1
a	1
pleasanter	1
man	1
in	1
his	1
life;	1
and	1
from	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
once	1
heard	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
himself	1
say,	1
was	1
very	1
sure	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
made	1
less	1
than	1
twenty	1
thousand	1
pounds	1
by	1
the	1
war.	1
Here	1
was	1
a	1
fortune	1
at	1
once;	1
besides	1
which,	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
chance	1
of	1
what	1
might	1
be	1
done	1
in	1
any	1
future	1
war;	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
sure	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
was	1
as	1
likely	1
a	1
man	1
to	1
distinguish	1
himself	1
as	1
any	1
officer	1
in	1
the	1
navy.	1
Oh!	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
capital	1
match	1
for	1
either	1
of	1
his	1
sisters."	1
"Upon	1
my	1
word	1
it	1
would,"	1
replied	1
Mary.	1
"Dear	1
me!	1
If	1
he	1
should	1
rise	1
to	1
any	1
very	1
great	1
honours!	1
If	1
he	1
should	1
ever	1
be	1
made	1
a	1
baronet!	1
`Lady	1
Wentworth'	1
sounds	1
very	1
well.	1
That	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
noble	1
thing,	1
indeed,	1
for	1
Henrietta!	1
She	1
would	1
take	1
place	1
of	1
me	1
then,	1
and	1
Henrietta	1
would	1
not	1
dislike	1
that.	1
Sir	1
Frederick	1
and	1
Lady	1
Wentworth!	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
but	1
a	1
new	1
creation,	1
however,	1
and	1
I	1
never	1
think	1
much	1
of	1
your	1
new	1
creations."	1
It	1
suited	1
Mary	1
best	1
to	1
think	1
Henrietta	1
the	1
one	1
preferred	1
on	1
the	1
very	1
account	1
of	1
Charles	1
Hayter,	1
whose	1
pretensions	1
she	1
wished	1
to	1
see	1
put	1
an	1
end	1
to.	1
She	1
looked	1
down	1
very	1
decidedly	1
upon	1
the	1
Hayters,	1
and	1
thought	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
quite	1
a	1
misfortune	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
existing	1
connection	1
between	1
the	1
families	1
renewed--very	1
sad	1
for	1
herself	1
and	1
her	1
children.	1
"You	1
know,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"I	1
cannot	1
think	1
him	1
at	1
all	1
a	1
fit	1
match	1
for	1
Henrietta;	1
and	1
considering	1
the	1
alliances	1
which	1
the	1
Musgroves	1
have	1
made,	1
she	1
has	1
no	1
right	1
to	1
throw	1
herself	1
away.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
any	1
young	1
woman	1
has	1
a	1
right	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
choice	1
that	1
may	1
be	1
disagreeable	1
and	1
inconvenient	1
to	1
the	1
principal	1
part	1
of	1
her	1
family,	1
and	1
be	1
giving	1
bad	1
connections	1
to	1
those	1
who	1
have	1
not	1
been	1
used	1
to	1
them.	1
And,	1
pray,	1
who	1
is	1
Charles	1
Hayter?	1
Nothing	1
but	1
a	1
country	1
curate.	1
A	1
most	1
improper	1
match	1
for	1
Miss	1
Musgrove	1
of	1
Uppercross."	1
Her	1
husband,	1
however,	1
would	1
not	1
agree	1
with	1
her	1
here;	1
for	1
besides	1
having	1
a	1
regard	1
for	1
his	1
cousin,	1
Charles	1
Hayter	1
was	1
an	1
eldest	1
son,	1
and	1
he	1
saw	1
things	1
as	1
an	1
eldest	1
son	1
himself.	1
"Now	1
you	1
are	1
taking	1
nonsense,	1
Mary,"	1
was	1
therefore	1
his	1
answer.	1
"It	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
a	1
great	1
match	1
for	1
Henrietta,	1
but	1
Charles	1
has	1
a	1
very	1
fair	1
chance,	1
through	1
the	1
Spicers,	1
of	1
getting	1
something	1
from	1
the	1
Bishop	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
a	1
year	1
or	1
two;	1
and	1
you	1
will	1
please	1
to	1
remember,	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
eldest	1
son;	1
whenever	1
my	1
uncle	1
dies,	1
he	1
steps	1
into	1
very	1
pretty	1
property.	1
The	1
estate	1
at	1
Winthrop	1
is	1
not	1
less	1
than	1
two	1
hundred	1
and	1
fifty	1
acres,	1
besides	1
the	1
farm	1
near	1
Taunton,	1
which	1
is	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
land	1
in	1
the	1
country.	1
I	1
grant	1
you,	1
that	1
any	1
of	1
them	1
but	1
Charles	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
very	1
shocking	1
match	1
for	1
Henrietta,	1
and	1
indeed	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
be;	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
only	1
one	1
that	1
could	1
be	1
possible;	1
but	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
good-natured,	1
good	1
sort	1
of	1
a	1
fellow;	1
and	1
whenever	1
Winthrop	1
comes	1
into	1
his	1
hands,	1
he	1
will	1
make	1
a	1
different	1
sort	1
of	1
place	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
live	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
different	1
sort	1
of	1
way;	1
and	1
with	1
that	1
property,	1
he	1
will	1
never	1
be	1
a	1
contemptible	1
man--good,	1
freehold	1
property.	1
No,	1
no;	1
Henrietta	1
might	1
do	1
worse	1
than	1
marry	1
Charles	1
Hayter;	1
and	1
if	1
she	1
has	1
him,	1
and	1
Louisa	1
can	1
get	1
Captain	1
Wentworth,	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
very	1
well	1
satisfied."	1
"Charles	1
may	1
say	1
what	1
he	1
pleases,"	1
cried	1
Mary	1
to	1
Anne,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room,	1
"but	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
shocking	1
to	1
have	1
Henrietta	1
marry	1
Charles	1
Hayter;	1
a	1
very	1
bad	1
thing	1
for	1
her,	1
and	1
still	1
worse	1
for	1
me;	1
and	1
therefore	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
much	1
to	1
be	1
wished	1
that	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
may	1
soon	1
put	1
him	1
quite	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
head,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
very	1
little	1
doubt	1
that	1
he	1
has.	1
She	1
took	1
hardly	1
any	1
notice	1
of	1
Charles	1
Hayter	1
yesterday.	1
I	1
wish	1
you	1
had	1
been	1
there	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
behaviour.	1
And	1
as	1
to	1
Captain	1
Wentworth's	1
liking	1
Louisa	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
Henrietta,	1
it	1
is	1
nonsense	1
to	1
say	1
so;	1
for	1
he	1
certainly	1
does	1
like	1
Henrietta	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
the	1
best.	1
But	1
Charles	1
is	1
so	1
positive!	1
I	1
wish	1
you	1
had	1
been	1
with	1
us	1
yesterday,	1
for	1
then	1
you	1
might	1
have	1
decided	1
between	1
us;	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
thought	1
as	1
I	1
did,	1
unless	1
you	1
had	1
been	1
determined	1
to	1
give	1
it	1
against	1
me."	1
A	1
dinner	1
at	1
Mr	1
Musgrove's	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
occasion	1
when	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
seen	1
by	1
Anne;	1
but	1
she	1
had	1
staid	1
at	1
home,	1
under	1
the	1
mixed	1
plea	1
of	1
a	1
headache	1
of	1
her	1
own,	1
and	1
some	1
return	1
of	1
indisposition	1
in	1
little	1
Charles.	1
She	1
had	1
thought	1
only	1
of	1
avoiding	1
Captain	1
Wentworth;	1
but	1
an	1
escape	1
from	1
being	1
appealed	1
to	1
as	1
umpire	1
was	1
now	1
added	1
to	1
the	1
advantages	1
of	1
a	1
quiet	1
evening.	1
As	1
to	1
Captain	1
Wentworth's	1
views,	1
she	1
deemed	1
it	1
of	1
more	1
consequence	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
know	1
his	1
own	1
mind	1
early	1
enough	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
endangering	1
the	1
happiness	1
of	1
either	1
sister,	1
or	1
impeaching	1
his	1
own	1
honour,	1
than	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
prefer	1
Henrietta	1
to	1
Louisa,	1
or	1
Louisa	1
to	1
Henrietta.	1
Either	1
of	1
them	1
would,	1
in	1
all	1
probability,	1
make	1
him	1
an	1
affectionate,	1
good-humoured	1
wife.	1
With	1
regard	1
to	1
Charles	1
Hayter,	1
she	1
had	1
delicacy	1
which	1
must	1
be	1
pained	1
by	1
any	1
lightness	1
of	1
conduct	1
in	1
a	1
well-meaning	1
young	1
woman,	1
and	1
a	1
heart	1
to	1
sympathize	1
in	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
sufferings	1
it	1
occasioned;	1
but	1
if	1
Henrietta	1
found	1
herself	1
mistaken	1
in	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
her	1
feelings,	1
the	1
alternation	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
understood	1
too	1
soon.	1
Charles	1
Hayter	1
had	1
met	1
with	1
much	1
to	1
disquiet	1
and	1
mortify	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
cousin's	1
behaviour.	1
She	1
had	1
too	1
old	1
a	1
regard	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
wholly	1
estranged	1
as	1
might	1
in	1
two	1
meetings	1
extinguish	1
every	1
past	1
hope,	1
and	1
leave	1
him	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
but	1
to	1
keep	1
away	1
from	1
Uppercross:	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
such	1
a	1
change	1
as	1
became	1
very	1
alarming,	1
when	1
such	1
a	1
man	1
as	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
regarded	1
as	1
the	1
probable	1
cause.	1
He	1
had	1
been	1
absent	1
only	1
two	1
Sundays,	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
parted,	1
had	1
left	1
her	1
interested,	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
his	1
wishes,	1
in	1
his	1
prospect	1
of	1
soon	1
quitting	1
his	1
present	1
curacy,	1
and	1
obtaining	1
that	1
of	1
Uppercross	1
instead.	1
It	1
had	1
then	1
seemed	1
the	1
object	1
nearest	1
her	1
heart,	1
that	1
Dr	1
Shirley,	1
the	1
rector,	1
who	1
for	1
more	1
than	1
forty	1
years	1
had	1
been	1
zealously	1
discharging	1
all	1
the	1
duties	1
of	1
his	1
office,	1
but	1
was	1
now	1
growing	1
too	1
infirm	1
for	1
many	1
of	1
them,	1
should	1
be	1
quite	1
fixed	1
on	1
engaging	1
a	1
curate;	1
should	1
make	1
his	1
curacy	1
quite	1
as	1
good	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
afford,	1
and	1
should	1
give	1
Charles	1
Hayter	1
the	1
promise	1
of	1
it.	1
The	1
advantage	1
of	1
his	1
having	1
to	1
come	1
only	1
to	1
Uppercross,	1
instead	1
of	1
going	1
six	1
miles	1
another	1
way;	1
of	1
his	1
having,	1
in	1
every	1
respect,	1
a	1
better	1
curacy;	1
of	1
his	1
belonging	1
to	1
their	1
dear	1
Dr	1
Shirley,	1
and	1
of	1
dear,	1
good	1
Dr	1
Shirley's	1
being	1
relieved	1
from	1
the	1
duty	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
no	1
longer	1
get	1
through	1
without	1
most	1
injurious	1
fatigue,	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
great	1
deal,	1
even	1
to	1
Louisa,	1
but	1
had	1
been	1
almost	1
everything	1
to	1
Henrietta.	1
When	1
he	1
came	1
back,	1
alas!	1
the	1
zeal	1
of	1
the	1
business	1
was	1
gone	1
by.	1
Louisa	1
could	1
not	1
listen	1
at	1
all	1
to	1
his	1
account	1
of	1
a	1
conversation	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
just	1
held	1
with	1
Dr	1
Shirley:	1
she	1
was	1
at	1
a	1
window,	1
looking	1
out	1
for	1
Captain	1
Wentworth;	1
and	1
even	1
Henrietta	1
had	1
at	1
best	1
only	1
a	1
divided	1
attention	1
to	1
give,	1
and	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
forgotten	1
all	1
the	1
former	1
doubt	1
and	1
solicitude	1
of	1
the	1
negotiation.	1
"Well,	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
glad	1
indeed:	1
but	1
I	1
always	1
thought	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
it;	1
I	1
always	1
thought	1
you	1
sure.	1
It	1
did	1
not	1
appear	1
to	1
me	1
that--in	1
short,	1
you	1
know,	1
Dr	1
Shirley	1
must	1
have	1
a	1
curate,	1
and	1
you	1
had	1
secured	1
his	1
promise.	1
Is	1
he	1
coming,	1
Louisa?"	1
One	1
morning,	1
very	1
soon	1
after	1
the	1
dinner	1
at	1
the	1
Musgroves,	1
at	1
which	1
Anne	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
present,	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
walked	1
into	1
the	1
drawing-room	1
at	1
the	1
Cottage,	1
where	1
were	1
only	1
herself	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
invalid	1
Charles,	1
who	1
was	1
lying	1
on	1
the	1
sofa.	1
The	1
surprise	1
of	1
finding	1
himself	1
almost	1
alone	1
with	1
Anne	1
Elliot,	1
deprived	1
his	1
manners	1
of	1
their	1
usual	1
composure:	1
he	1
started,	1
and	1
could	1
only	1
say,	1
"I	1
thought	1
the	1
Miss	1
Musgroves	1
had	1
been	1
here:	1
Mrs	1
Musgrove	1
told	1
me	1
I	1
should	1
find	1
them	1
here,"	1
before	1
he	1
walked	1
to	1
the	1
window	1
to	1
recollect	1
himself,	1
and	1
feel	1
how	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
behave.	1
"They	1
are	1
up	1
stairs	1
with	1
my	1
sister:	1
they	1
will	1
be	1
down	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
moments,	1
I	1
dare	1
say,"	1
had	1
been	1
Anne's	1
reply,	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
confusion	1
that	1
was	1
natural;	1
and	1
if	1
the	1
child	1
had	1
not	1
called	1
her	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
do	1
something	1
for	1
him,	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
the	1
next	1
moment,	1
and	1
released	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
herself.	1
He	1
continued	1
at	1
the	1
window;	1
and	1
after	1
calmly	1
and	1
politely	1
saying,	1
"I	1
hope	1
the	1
little	1
boy	1
is	1
better,"	1
was	1
silent.	1
She	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
kneel	1
down	1
by	1
the	1
sofa,	1
and	1
remain	1
there	1
to	1
satisfy	1
her	1
patient;	1
and	1
thus	1
they	1
continued	1
a	1
few	1
minutes,	1
when,	1
to	1
her	1
very	1
great	1
satisfaction,	1
she	1
heard	1
some	1
other	1
person	1
crossing	1
the	1
little	1
vestibule.	1
She	1
hoped,	1
on	1
turning	1
her	1
head,	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
master	1
of	1
the	1
house;	1
but	1
it	1
proved	1
to	1
be	1
one	1
much	1
less	1
calculated	1
for	1
making	1
matters	1
easy--Charles	1
Hayter,	1
probably	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
better	1
pleased	1
by	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
than	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
had	1
been	1
by	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
Anne.	1
She	1
only	1
attempted	1
to	1
say,	1
"How	1
do	1
you	1
do?	1
Will	1
you	1
not	1
sit	1
down?	1
The	1
others	1
will	1
be	1
here	1
presently."	1
Captain	1
Wentworth,	1
however,	1
came	1
from	1
his	1
window,	1
apparently	1
not	1
ill-disposed	1
for	1
conversation;	1
but	1
Charles	1
Hayter	1
soon	1
put	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
his	1
attempts	1
by	1
seating	1
himself	1
near	1
the	1
table,	1
and	1
taking	1
up	1
the	1
newspaper;	1
and	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
returned	1
to	1
his	1
window.	1
Another	1
minute	1
brought	1
another	1
addition.	1
The	1
younger	1
boy,	1
a	1
remarkable	1
stout,	1
forward	1
child,	1
of	1
two	1
years	1
old,	1
having	1
got	1
the	1
door	1
opened	1
for	1
him	1
by	1
some	1
one	1
without,	1
made	1
his	1
determined	1
appearance	1
among	1
them,	1
and	1
went	1
straight	1
to	1
the	1
sofa	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
was	1
going	1
on,	1
and	1
put	1
in	1
his	1
claim	1
to	1
anything	1
good	1
that	1
might	1
be	1
giving	1
away.	1
There	1
being	1
nothing	1
to	1
eat,	1
he	1
could	1
only	1
have	1
some	1
play;	1
and	1
as	1
his	1
aunt	1
would	1
not	1
let	1
him	1
tease	1
his	1
sick	1
brother,	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
fasten	1
himself	1
upon	1
her,	1
as	1
she	1
knelt,	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
way	1
that,	1
busy	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
about	1
Charles,	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
shake	1
him	1
off.	1
She	1
spoke	1
to	1
him,	1
ordered,	1
entreated,	1
and	1
insisted	1
in	1
vain.	1
Once	1
she	1
did	1
contrive	1
to	1
push	1
him	1
away,	1
but	1
the	1
boy	1
had	1
the	1
greater	1
pleasure	1
in	1
getting	1
upon	1
her	1
back	1
again	1
directly.	1
"Walter,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"get	1
down	1
this	1
moment.	1
You	1
are	1
extremely	1
troublesome.	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
angry	1
with	1
you."	1
"Walter,"	1
cried	1
Charles	1
Hayter,	1
"why	1
do	1
you	1
not	1
do	1
as	1
you	1
are	1
bid?	1
Do	1
not	1
you	1
hear	1
your	1
aunt	1
speak?	1
Come	1
to	1
me,	1
Walter,	1
come	1
to	1
cousin	1
Charles."	1
But	1
not	1
a	1
bit	1
did	1
Walter	1
stir.	1
In	1
another	1
moment,	1
however,	1
she	1
found	1
herself	1
in	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
being	1
released	1
from	1
him;	1
some	1
one	1
was	1
taking	1
him	1
from	1
her,	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
bent	1
down	1
her	1
head	1
so	1
much,	1
that	1
his	1
little	1
sturdy	1
hands	1
were	1
unfastened	1
from	1
around	1
her	1
neck,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
resolutely	1
borne	1
away,	1
before	1
she	1
knew	1
that	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
had	1
done	1
it.	1
Her	1
sensations	1
on	1
the	1
discovery	1
made	1
her	1
perfectly	1
speechless.	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
even	1
thank	1
him.	1
She	1
could	1
only	1
hang	1
over	1
little	1
Charles,	1
with	1
most	1
disordered	1
feelings.	1
His	1
kindness	1
in	1
stepping	1
forward	1
to	1
her	1
relief,	1
the	1
manner,	1
the	1
silence	1
in	1
which	1
it	1
had	1
passed,	1
the	1
little	1
particulars	1
of	1
the	1
circumstance,	1
with	1
the	1
conviction	1
soon	1
forced	1
on	1
her	1
by	1
the	1
noise	1
he	1
was	1
studiously	1
making	1
with	1
the	1
child,	1
that	1
he	1
meant	1
to	1
avoid	1
hearing	1
her	1
thanks,	1
and	1
rather	1
sought	1
to	1
testify	1
that	1
her	1
conversation	1
was	1
the	1
last	1
of	1
his	1
wants,	1
produced	1
such	1
a	1
confusion	1
of	1
varying,	1
but	1
very	1
painful	1
agitation,	1
as	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
recover	1
from,	1
till	1
enabled	1
by	1
the	1
entrance	1
of	1
Mary	1
and	1
the	1
Miss	1
Musgroves	1
to	1
make	1
over	1
her	1
little	1
patient	1
to	1
their	1
cares,	1
and	1
leave	1
the	1
room.	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
stay.	1
It	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
an	1
opportunity	1
of	1
watching	1
the	1
loves	1
and	1
jealousies	1
of	1
the	1
four--	1
they	1
were	1
now	1
altogether;	1
but	1
she	1
could	1
stay	1
for	1
none	1
of	1
it.	1
It	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
Charles	1
Hayter	1
was	1
not	1
well	1
inclined	1
towards	1
Captain	1
Wentworth.	1
She	1
had	1
a	1
strong	1
impression	1
of	1
his	1
having	1
said,	1
in	1
a	1
vext	1
tone	1
of	1
voice,	1
after	1
Captain	1
Wentworth's	1
interference,	1
"You	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
minded	1
me,	1
Walter;	1
I	1
told	1
you	1
not	1
to	1
teaze	1
your	1
aunt;"	1
and	1
could	1
comprehend	1
his	1
regretting	1
that	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
should	1
do	1
what	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
done	1
himself.	1
But	1
neither	1
Charles	1
Hayter's	1
feelings,	1
nor	1
anybody's	1
feelings,	1
could	1
interest	1
her,	1
till	1
she	1
had	1
a	1
little	1
better	1
arranged	1
her	1
own.	1
She	1
was	1
ashamed	1
of	1
herself,	1
quite	1
ashamed	1
of	1
being	1
so	1
nervous,	1
so	1
overcome	1
by	1
such	1
a	1
trifle;	1
but	1
so	1
it	1
was,	1
and	1
it	1
required	1
a	1
long	1
application	1
of	1
solitude	1
and	1
reflection	1
to	1
recover	1
her.	1
Chapter	1
10	1
Other	1
opportunities	1
of	1
making	1
her	1
observations	1
could	1
not	1
fail	1
to	1
occur.	1
Anne	1
had	1
soon	1
been	1
in	1
company	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
four	1
together	1
often	1
enough	1
to	1
have	1
an	1
opinion,	1
though	1
too	1
wise	1
to	1
acknowledge	1
as	1
much	1
at	1
home,	1
where	1
she	1
knew	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
satisfied	1
neither	1
husband	1
nor	1
wife;	1
for	1
while	1
she	1
considered	1
Louisa	1
to	1
be	1
rather	1
the	1
favourite,	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
think,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
she	1
might	1
dare	1
to	1
judge	1
from	1
memory	1
and	1
experience,	1
that	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
either.	1
They	1
were	1
more	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
him;	1
yet	1
there	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
love.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
fever	1
of	1
admiration;	1
but	1
it	1
might,	1
probably	1
must,	1
end	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
some.	1
Charles	1
Hayter	1
seemed	1
aware	1
of	1
being	1
slighted,	1
and	1
yet	1
Henrietta	1
had	1
sometimes	1
the	1
air	1
of	1
being	1
divided	1
between	1
them.	1
Anne	1
longed	1
for	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
representing	1
to	1
them	1
all	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
about,	1
and	1
of	1
pointing	1
out	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
evils	1
they	1
were	1
exposing	1
themselves	1
to.	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
attribute	1
guile	1
to	1
any.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
highest	1
satisfaction	1
to	1
her	1
to	1
believe	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
aware	1
of	1
the	1
pain	1
he	1
was	1
occasioning.	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
triumph,	1
no	1
pitiful	1
triumph	1
in	1
his	1
manner.	1
He	1
had,	1
probably,	1
never	1
heard,	1
and	1
never	1
thought	1
of	1
any	1
claims	1
of	1
Charles	1
Hayter.	1
He	1
was	1
only	1
wrong	1
in	1
accepting	1
the	1
attentions	1
(for	1
accepting	1
must	1
be	1
the	1
word)	1
of	1
two	1
young	1
women	1
at	1
once.	1
After	1
a	1
short	1
struggle,	1
however,	1
Charles	1
Hayter	1
seemed	1
to	1
quit	1
the	1
field.	1
Three	1
days	1
had	1
passed	1
without	1
his	1
coming	1
once	1
to	1
Uppercross;	1
a	1
most	1
decided	1
change.	1
He	1
had	1
even	1
refused	1
one	1
regular	1
invitation	1
to	1
dinner;	1
and	1
having	1
been	1
found	1
on	1
the	1
occasion	1
by	1
Mr	1
Musgrove	1
with	1
some	1
large	1
books	1
before	1
him,	1
Mr	1
and	1
Mrs	1
Musgrove	1
were	1
sure	1
all	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
right,	1
and	1
talked,	1
with	1
grave	1
faces,	1
of	1
his	1
studying	1
himself	1
to	1
death.	1
It	1
was	1
Mary's	1
hope	1
and	1
belief	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
received	1
a	1
positive	1
dismissal	1
from	1
Henrietta,	1
and	1
her	1
husband	1
lived	1
under	1
the	1
constant	1
dependence	1
of	1
seeing	1
him	1
to-morrow.	1
Anne	1
could	1
only	1
feel	1
that	1
Charles	1
Hayter	1
was	1
wise.	1
One	1
morning,	1
about	1
this	1
time	1
Charles	1
Musgrove	1
and	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
being	1
gone	1
a-shooting	1
together,	1
as	1
the	1
sisters	1
in	1
the	1
Cottage	1
were	1
sitting	1
quietly	1
at	1
work,	1
they	1
were	1
visited	1
at	1
the	1
window	1
by	1
the	1
sisters	1
from	1
the	1
Mansion-house.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
fine	1
November	1
day,	1
and	1
the	1
Miss	1
Musgroves	1
came	1
through	1
the	1
little	1
grounds,	1
and	1
stopped	1
for	1
no	1
other	1
purpose	1
than	1
to	1
say,	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
going	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
long	1
walk,	1
and	1
therefore	1
concluded	1
Mary	1
could	1
not	1
like	1
to	1
go	1
with	1
them;	1
and	1
when	1
Mary	1
immediately	1
replied,	1
with	1
some	1
jealousy	1
at	1
not	1
being	1
supposed	1
a	1
good	1
walker,	1
"Oh,	1
yes,	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
join	1
you	1
very	1
much,	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
fond	1
of	1
a	1
long	1
walk;"	1
Anne	1
felt	1
persuaded,	1
by	1
the	1
looks	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
girls,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
precisely	1
what	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
wish,	1
and	1
admired	1
again	1
the	1
sort	1
of	1
necessity	1
which	1
the	1
family	1
habits	1
seemed	1
to	1
produce,	1
of	1
everything	1
being	1
to	1
be	1
communicated,	1
and	1
everything	1
being	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
together,	1
however	1
undesired	1
and	1
inconvenient.	1
She	1
tried	1
to	1
dissuade	1
Mary	1
from	1
going,	1
but	1
in	1
vain;	1
and	1
that	1
being	1
the	1
case,	1
thought	1
it	1
best	1
to	1
accept	1
the	1
Miss	1
Musgroves'	1
much	1
more	1
cordial	1
invitation	1
to	1
herself	1
to	1
go	1
likewise,	1
as	1
she	1
might	1
be	1
useful	1
in	1
turning	1
back	1
with	1
her	1
sister,	1
and	1
lessening	1
the	1
interference	1
in	1
any	1
plan	1
of	1
their	1
own.	1
"I	1
cannot	1
imagine	1
why	1
they	1
should	1
suppose	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
like	1
a	1
long	1
walk,"	1
said	1
Mary,	1
as	1
she	1
went	1
up	1
stairs.	1
"Everybody	1
is	1
always	1
supposing	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
a	1
good	1
walker;	1
and	1
yet	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
pleased,	1
if	1
we	1
had	1
refused	1
to	1
join	1
them.	1
When	1
people	1
come	1
in	1
this	1
manner	1
on	1
purpose	1
to	1
ask	1
us,	1
how	1
can	1
one	1
say	1
no?"	1
Just	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
setting	1
off,	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
returned.	1
They	1
had	1
taken	1
out	1
a	1
young	1
dog,	1
who	1
had	1
spoilt	1
their	1
sport,	1
and	1
sent	1
them	1
back	1
early.	1
Their	1
time	1
and	1
strength,	1
and	1
spirits,	1
were,	1
therefore,	1
exactly	1
ready	1
for	1
this	1
walk,	1
and	1
they	1
entered	1
into	1
it	1
with	1
pleasure.	1
Could	1
Anne	1
have	1
foreseen	1
such	1
a	1
junction,	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
staid	1
at	1
home;	1
but,	1
from	1
some	1
feelings	1
of	1
interest	1
and	1
curiosity,	1
she	1
fancied	1
now	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
too	1
late	1
to	1
retract,	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
six	1
set	1
forward	1
together	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
chosen	1
by	1
the	1
Miss	1
Musgroves,	1
who	1
evidently	1
considered	1
the	1
walk	1
as	1
under	1
their	1
guidance.	1
Anne's	1
object	1
was,	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
anybody;	1
and	1
where	1
the	1
narrow	1
paths	1
across	1
the	1
fields	1
made	1
many	1
separations	1
necessary,	1
to	1
keep	1
with	1
her	1
brother	1
and	1
sister.	1
Her	1
pleasure	1
in	1
the	1
walk	1
must	1
arise	1
from	1
the	1
exercise	1
and	1
the	1
day,	1
from	1
the	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
last	1
smiles	1
of	1
the	1
year	1
upon	1
the	1
tawny	1
leaves,	1
and	1
withered	1
hedges,	1
and	1
from	1
repeating	1
to	1
herself	1
some	1
few	1
of	1
the	1
thousand	1
poetical	1
descriptions	1
extant	1
of	1
autumn,	1
that	1
season	1
of	1
peculiar	1
and	1
inexhaustible	1
influence	1
on	1
the	1
mind	1
of	1
taste	1
and	1
tenderness,	1
that	1
season	1
which	1
had	1
drawn	1
from	1
every	1
poet,	1
worthy	1
of	1
being	1
read,	1
some	1
attempt	1
at	1
description,	1
or	1
some	1
lines	1
of	1
feeling.	1
She	1
occupied	1
her	1
mind	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
possible	1
in	1
such	1
like	1
musings	1
and	1
quotations;	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
possible,	1
that	1
when	1
within	1
reach	1
of	1
Captain	1
Wentworth's	1
conversation	1
with	1
either	1
of	1
the	1
Miss	1
Musgroves,	1
she	1
should	1
not	1
try	1
to	1
hear	1
it;	1
yet	1
she	1
caught	1
little	1
very	1
remarkable.	1
It	1
was	1
mere	1
lively	1
chat,	1
such	1
as	1
any	1
young	1
persons,	1
on	1
an	1
intimate	1
footing,	1
might	1
fall	1
into.	1
He	1
was	1
more	1
engaged	1
with	1
Louisa	1
than	1
with	1
Henrietta.	1
Louisa	1
certainly	1
put	1
more	1
forward	1
for	1
his	1
notice	1
than	1
her	1
sister.	1
This	1
distinction	1
appeared	1
to	1
increase,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
one	1
speech	1
of	1
Louisa's	1
which	1
struck	1
her.	1
After	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
many	1
praises	1
of	1
the	1
day,	1
which	1
were	1
continually	1
bursting	1
forth,	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
added:	1
--	1
"What	1
glorious	1
weather	1
for	1
the	1
Admiral	1
and	1
my	1
sister!	1
They	1
meant	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
long	1
drive	1
this	1
morning;	1
perhaps	1
we	1
may	1
hail	1
them	1
from	1
some	1
of	1
these	1
hills.	1
They	1
talked	1
of	1
coming	1
into	1
this	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
country.	1
I	1
wonder	1
whereabouts	1
they	1
will	1
upset	1
to-day.	1
Oh!	1
it	1
does	1
happen	1
very	1
often,	1
I	1
assure	1
you;	1
but	1
my	1
sister	1
makes	1
nothing	1
of	1
it;	1
she	1
would	1
as	1
lieve	1
be	1
tossed	1
out	1
as	1
not."	1
"Ah!	1
You	1
make	1
the	1
most	1
of	1
it,	1
I	1
know,"	1
cried	1
Louisa,	1
"but	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
really	1
so,	1
I	1
should	1
do	1
just	1
the	1
same	1
in	1
her	1
place.	1
If	1
I	1
loved	1
a	1
man,	1
as	1
she	1
loves	1
the	1
Admiral,	1
I	1
would	1
always	1
be	1
with	1
him,	1
nothing	1
should	1
ever	1
separate	1
us,	1
and	1
I	1
would	1
rather	1
be	1
overturned	1
by	1
him,	1
than	1
driven	1
safely	1
by	1
anybody	1
else."	1
It	1
was	1
spoken	1
with	1
enthusiasm.	1
"Had	1
you?"	1
cried	1
he,	1
catching	1
the	1
same	1
tone;	1
"I	1
honour	1
you!"	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
silence	1
between	1
them	1
for	1
a	1
little	1
while.	1
Anne	1
could	1
not	1
immediately	1
fall	1
into	1
a	1
quotation	1
again.	1
The	1
sweet	1
scenes	1
of	1
autumn	1
were	1
for	1
a	1
while	1
put	1
by,	1
unless	1
some	1
tender	1
sonnet,	1
fraught	1
with	1
the	1
apt	1
analogy	1
of	1
the	1
declining	1
year,	1
with	1
declining	1
happiness,	1
and	1
the	1
images	1
of	1
youth	1
and	1
hope,	1
and	1
spring,	1
all	1
gone	1
together,	1
blessed	1
her	1
memory.	1
She	1
roused	1
herself	1
to	1
say,	1
as	1
they	1
struck	1
by	1
order	1
into	1
another	1
path,	1
"Is	1
not	1
this	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
ways	1
to	1
Winthrop?"	1
But	1
nobody	1
heard,	1
or,	1
at	1
least,	1
nobody	1
answered	1
her.	1
Winthrop,	1
however,	1
or	1
its	1
environs--for	1
young	1
men	1
are,	1
sometimes	1
to	1
be	1
met	1
with,	1
strolling	1
about	1
near	1
home--was	1
their	1
destination;	1
and	1
after	1
another	1
half	1
mile	1
of	1
gradual	1
ascent	1
through	1
large	1
enclosures,	1
where	1
the	1
ploughs	1
at	1
work,	1
and	1
the	1
fresh	1
made	1
path	1
spoke	1
the	1
farmer	1
counteracting	1
the	1
sweets	1
of	1
poetical	1
despondence,	1
and	1
meaning	1
to	1
have	1
spring	1
again,	1
they	1
gained	1
the	1
summit	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
considerable	1
hill,	1
which	1
parted	1
Uppercross	1
and	1
Winthrop,	1
and	1
soon	1
commanded	1
a	1
full	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
latter,	1
at	1
the	1
foot	1
of	1
the	1
hill	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side.	1
Winthrop,	1
without	1
beauty	1
and	1
without	1
dignity,	1
was	1
stretched	1
before	1
them	1
an	1
indifferent	1
house,	1
standing	1
low,	1
and	1
hemmed	1
in	1
by	1
the	1
barns	1
and	1
buildings	1
of	1
a	1
farm-yard.	1
Mary	1
exclaimed,	1
"Bless	1
me!	1
here	1
is	1
Winthrop.	1
I	1
declare	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
idea!	1
Well	1
now,	1
I	1
think	1
we	1
had	1
better	1
turn	1
back;	1
I	1
am	1
excessively	1
tired."	1
Henrietta,	1
conscious	1
and	1
ashamed,	1
and	1
seeing	1
no	1
cousin	1
Charles	1
walking	1
along	1
any	1
path,	1
or	1
leaning	1
against	1
any	1
gate,	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
do	1
as	1
Mary	1
wished;	1
but	1
"No!"	1
said	1
Charles	1
Musgrove,	1
and	1
"No,	1
no!"	1
cried	1
Louisa	1
more	1
eagerly,	1
and	1
taking	1
her	1
sister	1
aside,	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
arguing	1
the	1
matter	1
warmly.	1
Charles,	1
in	1
the	1
meanwhile,	1
was	1
very	1
decidedly	1
declaring	1
his	1
resolution	1
of	1
calling	1
on	1
his	1
aunt,	1
now	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
near;	1
and	1
very	1
evidently,	1
though	1
more	1
fearfully,	1
trying	1
to	1
induce	1
his	1
wife	1
to	1
go	1
too.	1
But	1
this	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
points	1
on	1
which	1
the	1
lady	1
shewed	1
her	1
strength;	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
recommended	1
the	1
advantage	1
of	1
resting	1
herself	1
a	1
quarter	1
of	1
an	1
hour	1
at	1
Winthrop,	1
as	1
she	1
felt	1
so	1
tired,	1
she	1
resolutely	1
answered,	1
"Oh!	1
no,	1
indeed!	1
walking	1
up	1
that	1
hill	1
again	1
would	1
do	1
her	1
more	1
harm	1
than	1
any	1
sitting	1
down	1
could	1
do	1
her	1
good;"	1
and,	1
in	1
short,	1
her	1
look	1
and	1
manner	1
declared,	1
that	1
go	1
she	1
would	1
not.	1
After	1
a	1
little	1
succession	1
of	1
these	1
sort	1
of	1
debates	1
and	1
consultations,	1
it	1
was	1
settled	1
between	1
Charles	1
and	1
his	1
two	1
sisters,	1
that	1
he	1
and	1
Henrietta	1
should	1
just	1
run	1
down	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
minutes,	1
to	1
see	1
their	1
aunt	1
and	1
cousins,	1
while	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
party	1
waited	1
for	1
them	1
at	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
hill.	1
Louisa	1
seemed	1
the	1
principal	1
arranger	1
of	1
the	1
plan;	1
and,	1
as	1
she	1
went	1
a	1
little	1
way	1
with	1
them,	1
down	1
the	1
hill,	1
still	1
talking	1
to	1
Henrietta,	1
Mary	1
took	1
the	1
opportunity	1
of	1
looking	1
scornfully	1
around	1
her,	1
and	1
saying	1
to	1
Captain	1
Wentworth--	1
"It	1
is	1
very	1
unpleasant,	1
having	1
such	1
connexions!	1
But,	1
I	1
assure	1
you,	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
above	1
twice	1
in	1
my	1
life."	1
She	1
received	1
no	1
other	1
answer,	1
than	1
an	1
artificial,	1
assenting	1
smile,	1
followed	1
by	1
a	1
contemptuous	1
glance,	1
as	1
he	1
turned	1
away,	1
which	1
Anne	1
perfectly	1
knew	1
the	1
meaning	1
of.	1
The	1
brow	1
of	1
the	1
hill,	1
where	1
they	1
remained,	1
was	1
a	1
cheerful	1
spot:	1
Louisa	1
returned;	1
and	1
Mary,	1
finding	1
a	1
comfortable	1
seat	1
for	1
herself	1
on	1
the	1
step	1
of	1
a	1
stile,	1
was	1
very	1
well	1
satisfied	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
the	1
others	1
all	1
stood	1
about	1
her;	1
but	1
when	1
Louisa	1
drew	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
away,	1
to	1
try	1
for	1
a	1
gleaning	1
of	1
nuts	1
in	1
an	1
adjoining	1
hedge-row,	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
gone	1
by	1
degrees	1
quite	1
out	1
of	1
sight	1
and	1
sound,	1
Mary	1
was	1
happy	1
no	1
longer;	1
she	1
quarrelled	1
with	1
her	1
own	1
seat,	1
was	1
sure	1
Louisa	1
had	1
got	1
a	1
much	1
better	1
somewhere,	1
and	1
nothing	1
could	1
prevent	1
her	1
from	1
going	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
a	1
better	1
also.	1
She	1
turned	1
through	1
the	1
same	1
gate,	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
them.	1
Anne	1
found	1
a	1
nice	1
seat	1
for	1
her,	1
on	1
a	1
dry	1
sunny	1
bank,	1
under	1
the	1
hedge-row,	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
doubt	1
of	1
their	1
still	1
being,	1
in	1
some	1
spot	1
or	1
other.	1
Mary	1
sat	1
down	1
for	1
a	1
moment,	1
but	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
do;	1
she	1
was	1
sure	1
Louisa	1
had	1
found	1
a	1
better	1
seat	1
somewhere	1
else,	1
and	1
she	1
would	1
go	1
on	1
till	1
she	1
overtook	1
her.	1
Anne,	1
really	1
tired	1
herself,	1
was	1
glad	1
to	1
sit	1
down;	1
and	1
she	1
very	1
soon	1
heard	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
and	1
Louisa	1
in	1
the	1
hedge-row,	1
behind	1
her,	1
as	1
if	1
making	1
their	1
way	1
back	1
along	1
the	1
rough,	1
wild	1
sort	1
of	1
channel,	1
down	1
the	1
centre.	1
They	1
were	1
speaking	1
as	1
they	1
drew	1
near.	1
Louisa's	1
voice	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
distinguished.	1
She	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
some	1
eager	1
speech.	1
What	1
Anne	1
first	1
heard	1
was--	1
"And	1
so,	1
I	1
made	1
her	1
go.	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
bear	1
that	1
she	1
should	1
be	1
frightened	1
from	1
the	1
visit	1
by	1
such	1
nonsense.	1
What!	1
would	1
I	1
be	1
turned	1
back	1
from	1
doing	1
a	1
thing	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
determined	1
to	1
do,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
knew	1
to	1
be	1
right,	1
by	1
the	1
airs	1
and	1
interference	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
person,	1
or	1
of	1
any	1
person	1
I	1
may	1
say?	1
No,	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
idea	1
of	1
being	1
so	1
easily	1
persuaded.	1
When	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
up	1
my	1
mind,	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
it;	1
and	1
Henrietta	1
seemed	1
entirely	1
to	1
have	1
made	1
up	1
hers	1
to	1
call	1
at	1
Winthrop	1
to-day;	1
and	1
yet,	1
she	1
was	1
as	1
near	1
giving	1
it	1
up,	1
out	1
of	1
nonsensical	1
complaisance!"	1
"She	1
would	1
have	1
turned	1
back	1
then,	1
but	1
for	1
you?"	1
"She	1
would	1
indeed.	1
I	1
am	1
almost	1
ashamed	1
to	1
say	1
it."	1
"Happy	1
for	1
her,	1
to	1
have	1
such	1
a	1
mind	1
as	1
yours	1
at	1
hand!	1
After	1
the	1
hints	1
you	1
gave	1
just	1
now,	1
which	1
did	1
but	1
confirm	1
my	1
own	1
observations,	1
the	1
last	1
time	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
company	1
with	1
him,	1
I	1
need	1
not	1
affect	1
to	1
have	1
no	1
comprehension	1
of	1
what	1
is	1
going	1
on.	1
I	1
see	1
that	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
mere	1
dutiful	1
morning	1
visit	1
to	1
your	1
aunt	1
was	1
in	1
question;	1
and	1
woe	1
betide	1
him,	1
and	1
her	1
too,	1
when	1
it	1
comes	1
to	1
things	1
of	1
consequence,	1
when	1
they	1
are	1
placed	1
in	1
circumstances	1
requiring	1
fortitude	1
and	1
strength	1
of	1
mind,	1
if	1
she	1
have	1
not	1
resolution	1
enough	1
to	1
resist	1
idle	1
interference	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
trifle	1
as	1
this.	1
Your	1
sister	1
is	1
an	1
amiable	1
creature;	1
but	1
yours	1
is	1
the	1
character	1
of	1
decision	1
and	1
firmness,	1
I	1
see.	1
If	1
you	1
value	1
her	1
conduct	1
or	1
happiness,	1
infuse	1
as	1
much	1
of	1
your	1
own	1
spirit	1
into	1
her	1
as	1
you	1
can.	1
But	1
this,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
you	1
have	1
been	1
always	1
doing.	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
worst	1
evil	1
of	1
too	1
yielding	1
and	1
indecisive	1
a	1
character,	1
that	1
no	1
influence	1
over	1
it	1
can	1
be	1
depended	1
on.	1
You	1
are	1
never	1
sure	1
of	1
a	1
good	1
impression	1
being	1
durable;	1
everybody	1
may	1
sway	1
it.	1
Let	1
those	1
who	1
would	1
be	1
happy	1
be	1
firm.	1
Here	1
is	1
a	1
nut,"	1
said	1
he,	1
catching	1
one	1
down	1
from	1
an	1
upper	1
bough.	1
"to	1
exemplify:	1
a	1
beautiful	1
glossy	1
nut,	1
which,	1
blessed	1
with	1
original	1
strength,	1
has	1
outlived	1
all	1
the	1
storms	1
of	1
autumn.	1
Not	1
a	1
puncture,	1
not	1
a	1
weak	1
spot	1
anywhere.	1
This	1
nut,"	1
he	1
continued,	1
with	1
playful	1
solemnity,	1
"while	1
so	1
many	1
of	1
his	1
brethren	1
have	1
fallen	1
and	1
been	1
trodden	1
under	1
foot,	1
is	1
still	1
in	1
possession	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
happiness	1
that	1
a	1
hazel	1
nut	1
can	1
be	1
supposed	1
capable	1
of."	1
Then	1
returning	1
to	1
his	1
former	1
earnest	1
tone--	1
"My	1
first	1
wish	1
for	1
all	1
whom	1
I	1
am	1
interested	1
in,	1
is	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
firm.	1
If	1
Louisa	1
Musgrove	1
would	1
be	1
beautiful	1
and	1
happy	1
in	1
her	1
November	1
of	1
life,	1
she	1
will	1
cherish	1
all	1
her	1
present	1
powers	1
of	1
mind."	1
He	1
had	1
done,	1
and	1
was	1
unanswered.	1
It	1
would	1
have	1
surprised	1
Anne	1
if	1
Louisa	1
could	1
have	1
readily	1
answered	1
such	1
a	1
speech:	1
words	1
of	1
such	1
interest,	1
spoken	1
with	1
such	1
serious	1
warmth!	1
She	1
could	1
imagine	1
what	1
Louisa	1
was	1
feeling.	1
For	1
herself,	1
she	1
feared	1
to	1
move,	1
lest	1
she	1
should	1
be	1
seen.	1
While	1
she	1
remained,	1
a	1
bush	1
of	1
low	1
rambling	1
holly	1
protected	1
her,	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
moving	1
on.	1
Before	1
they	1
were	1
beyond	1
her	1
hearing,	1
however,	1
Louisa	1
spoke	1
again.	1
"Mary	1
is	1
good-natured	1
enough	1
in	1
many	1
respects,"	1
said	1
she;	1
"but	1
she	1
does	1
sometimes	1
provoke	1
me	1
excessively,	1
by	1
her	1
nonsense	1
and	1
pride--the	1
Elliot	1
pride.	1
She	1
has	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
too	1
much	1
of	1
the	1
Elliot	1
pride.	1
We	1
do	1
so	1
wish	1
that	1
Charles	1
had	1
married	1
Anne	1
instead.	1
I	1
suppose	1
you	1
know	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
marry	1
Anne?"	1
After	1
a	1
moment's	1
pause,	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
said--	1
"Do	1
you	1
mean	1
that	1
she	1
refused	1
him?"	1
"Oh!	1
yes;	1
certainly."	1
"When	1
did	1
that	1
happen?"	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
exactly	1
know,	1
for	1
Henrietta	1
and	1
I	1
were	1
at	1
school	1
at	1
the	1
time;	1
but	1
I	1
believe	1
about	1
a	1
year	1
before	1
he	1
married	1
Mary.	1
I	1
wish	1
she	1
had	1
accepted	1
him.	1
We	1
should	1
all	1
have	1
liked	1
her	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
better;	1
and	1
papa	1
and	1
mamma	1
always	1
think	1
it	1
was	1
her	1
great	1
friend	1
Lady	1
Russell's	1
doing,	1
that	1
she	1
did	1
not.	1
They	1
think	1
Charles	1
might	1
not	1
be	1
learned	1
and	1
bookish	1
enough	1
to	1
please	1
Lady	1
Russell,	1
and	1
that	1
therefore,	1
she	1
persuaded	1
Anne	1
to	1
refuse	1
him."	1
The	1
sounds	1
were	1
retreating,	1
and	1
Anne	1
distinguished	1
no	1
more.	1
Her	1
own	1
emotions	1
still	1
kept	1
her	1
fixed.	1
She	1
had	1
much	1
to	1
recover	1
from,	1
before	1
she	1
could	1
move.	1
The	1
listener's	1
proverbial	1
fate	1
was	1
not	1
absolutely	1
hers;	1
she	1
had	1
heard	1
no	1
evil	1
of	1
herself,	1
but	1
she	1
had	1
heard	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
very	1
painful	1
import.	1
She	1
saw	1
how	1
her	1
own	1
character	1
was	1
considered	1
by	1
Captain	1
Wentworth,	1
and	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
just	1
that	1
degree	1
of	1
feeling	1
and	1
curiosity	1
about	1
her	1
in	1
his	1
manner	1
which	1
must	1
give	1
her	1
extreme	1
agitation.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
could,	1
she	1
went	1
after	1
Mary,	1
and	1
having	1
found,	1
and	1
walked	1
back	1
with	1
her	1
to	1
their	1
former	1
station,	1
by	1
the	1
stile,	1
felt	1
some	1
comfort	1
in	1
their	1
whole	1
party	1
being	1
immediately	1
afterwards	1
collected,	1
and	1
once	1
more	1
in	1
motion	1
together.	1
Her	1
spirits	1
wanted	1
the	1
solitude	1
and	1
silence	1
which	1
only	1
numbers	1
could	1
give.	1
Charles	1
and	1
Henrietta	1
returned,	1
bringing,	1
as	1
may	1
be	1
conjectured,	1
Charles	1
Hayter	1
with	1
them.	1
The	1
minutiae	1
of	1
the	1
business	1
Anne	1
could	1
not	1
attempt	1
to	1
understand;	1
even	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
admitted	1
to	1
perfect	1
confidence	1
here;	1
but	1
that	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
withdrawing	1
on	1
the	1
gentleman's	1
side,	1
and	1
a	1
relenting	1
on	1
the	1
lady's,	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
now	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
be	1
together	1
again,	1
did	1
not	1
admit	1
a	1
doubt.	1
Henrietta	1
looked	1
a	1
little	1
ashamed,	1
but	1
very	1
well	1
pleased;--	1
Charles	1
Hayter	1
exceedingly	1
happy:	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
devoted	1
to	1
each	1
other	1
almost	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
instant	1
of	1
their	1
all	1
setting	1
forward	1
for	1
Uppercross.	1
Everything	1
now	1
marked	1
out	1
Louisa	1
for	1
Captain	1
Wentworth;	1
nothing	1
could	1
be	1
plainer;	1
and	1
where	1
many	1
divisions	1
were	1
necessary,	1
or	1
even	1
where	1
they	1
were	1
not,	1
they	1
walked	1
side	1
by	1
side	1
nearly	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
the	1
other	1
two.	1
In	1
a	1
long	1
strip	1
of	1
meadow	1
land,	1
where	1
there	1
was	1
ample	1
space	1
for	1
all,	1
they	1
were	1
thus	1
divided,	1
forming	1
three	1
distinct	1
parties;	1
and	1
to	1
that	1
party	1
of	1
the	1
three	1
which	1
boasted	1
least	1
animation,	1
and	1
least	1
complaisance,	1
Anne	1
necessarily	1
belonged.	1
She	1
joined	1
Charles	1
and	1
Mary,	1
and	1
was	1
tired	1
enough	1
to	1
be	1
very	1
glad	1
of	1
Charles's	1
other	1
arm;	1
but	1
Charles,	1
though	1
in	1
very	1
good	1
humour	1
with	1
her,	1
was	1
out	1
of	1
temper	1
with	1
his	1
wife.	1
Mary	1
had	1
shewn	1
herself	1
disobliging	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
was	1
now	1
to	1
reap	1
the	1
consequence,	1
which	1
consequence	1
was	1
his	1
dropping	1
her	1
arm	1
almost	1
every	1
moment	1
to	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
some	1
nettles	1
in	1
the	1
hedge	1
with	1
his	1
switch;	1
and	1
when	1
Mary	1
began	1
to	1
complain	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
lament	1
her	1
being	1
ill-used,	1
according	1
to	1
custom,	1
in	1
being	1
on	1
the	1
hedge	1
side,	1
while	1
Anne	1
was	1
never	1
incommoded	1
on	1
the	1
other,	1
he	1
dropped	1
the	1
arms	1
of	1
both	1
to	1
hunt	1
after	1
a	1
weasel	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
momentary	1
glance	1
of,	1
and	1
they	1
could	1
hardly	1
get	1
him	1
along	1
at	1
all.	1
This	1
long	1
meadow	1
bordered	1
a	1
lane,	1
which	1
their	1
footpath,	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
cross,	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
party	1
had	1
all	1
reached	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
exit,	1
the	1
carriage	1
advancing	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
direction,	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
some	1
time	1
heard,	1
was	1
just	1
coming	1
up,	1
and	1
proved	1
to	1
be	1
Admiral	1
Croft's	1
gig.	1
He	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
had	1
taken	1
their	1
intended	1
drive,	1
and	1
were	1
returning	1
home.	1
Upon	1
hearing	1
how	1
long	1
a	1
walk	1
the	1
young	1
people	1
had	1
engaged	1
in,	1
they	1
kindly	1
offered	1
a	1
seat	1
to	1
any	1
lady	1
who	1
might	1
be	1
particularly	1
tired;	1
it	1
would	1
save	1
her	1
a	1
full	1
mile,	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
going	1
through	1
Uppercross.	1
The	1
invitation	1
was	1
general,	1
and	1
generally	1
declined.	1
The	1
Miss	1
Musgroves	1
were	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
tired,	1
and	1
Mary	1
was	1
either	1
offended,	1
by	1
not	1
being	1
asked	1
before	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
others,	1
or	1
what	1
Louisa	1
called	1
the	1
Elliot	1
pride	1
could	1
not	1
endure	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
third	1
in	1
a	1
one	1
horse	1
chaise.	1
The	1
walking	1
party	1
had	1
crossed	1
the	1
lane,	1
and	1
were	1
surmounting	1
an	1
opposite	1
stile,	1
and	1
the	1
Admiral	1
was	1
putting	1
his	1
horse	1
in	1
motion	1
again,	1
when	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
cleared	1
the	1
hedge	1
in	1
a	1
moment	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
to	1
his	1
sister.	1
The	1
something	1
might	1
be	1
guessed	1
by	1
its	1
effects.	1
"Miss	1
Elliot,	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
you	1
are	1
tired,"	1
cried	1
Mrs	1
Croft.	1
"Do	1
let	1
us	1
have	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
taking	1
you	1
home.	1
Here	1
is	1
excellent	1
room	1
for	1
three,	1
I	1
assure	1
you.	1
If	1
we	1
were	1
all	1
like	1
you,	1
I	1
believe	1
we	1
might	1
sit	1
four.	1
You	1
must,	1
indeed,	1
you	1
must."	1
Anne	1
was	1
still	1
in	1
the	1
lane;	1
and	1
though	1
instinctively	1
beginning	1
to	1
decline,	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
allowed	1
to	1
proceed.	1
The	1
Admiral's	1
kind	1
urgency	1
came	1
in	1
support	1
of	1
his	1
wife's;	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
refused;	1
they	1
compressed	1
themselves	1
into	1
the	1
smallest	1
possible	1
space	1
to	1
leave	1
her	1
a	1
corner,	1
and	1
Captain	1
Wentworth,	1
without	1
saying	1
a	1
word,	1
turned	1
to	1
her,	1
and	1
quietly	1
obliged	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
assisted	1
into	1
the	1
carriage.	1
Yes;	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
it.	1
She	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
carriage,	1
and	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
placed	1
her	1
there,	1
that	1
his	1
will	1
and	1
his	1
hands	1
had	1
done	1
it,	1
that	1
she	1
owed	1
it	1
to	1
his	1
perception	1
of	1
her	1
fatigue,	1
and	1
his	1
resolution	1
to	1
give	1
her	1
rest.	1
She	1
was	1
very	1
much	1
affected	1
by	1
the	1
view	1
of	1
his	1
disposition	1
towards	1
her,	1
which	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
made	1
apparent.	1
This	1
little	1
circumstance	1
seemed	1
the	1
completion	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
gone	1
before.	1
She	1
understood	1
him.	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
forgive	1
her,	1
but	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
unfeeling.	1
Though	1
condemning	1
her	1
for	1
the	1
past,	1
and	1
considering	1
it	1
with	1
high	1
and	1
unjust	1
resentment,	1
though	1
perfectly	1
careless	1
of	1
her,	1
and	1
though	1
becoming	1
attached	1
to	1
another,	1
still	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
her	1
suffer,	1
without	1
the	1
desire	1
of	1
giving	1
her	1
relief.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
remainder	1
of	1
former	1
sentiment;	1
it	1
was	1
an	1
impulse	1
of	1
pure,	1
though	1
unacknowledged	1
friendship;	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
proof	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
warm	1
and	1
amiable	1
heart,	1
which	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
contemplate	1
without	1
emotions	1
so	1
compounded	1
of	1
pleasure	1
and	1
pain,	1
that	1
she	1
knew	1
not	1
which	1
prevailed.	1
Her	1
answers	1
to	1
the	1
kindness	1
and	1
the	1
remarks	1
of	1
her	1
companions	1
were	1
at	1
first	1
unconsciously	1
given.	1
They	1
had	1
travelled	1
half	1
their	1
way	1
along	1
the	1
rough	1
lane,	1
before	1
she	1
was	1
quite	1
awake	1
to	1
what	1
they	1
said.	1
She	1
then	1
found	1
them	1
talking	1
of	1
"Frederick."	1
"He	1
certainly	1
means	1
to	1
have	1
one	1
or	1
other	1
of	1
those	1
two	1
girls,	1
Sophy,"	1
said	1
the	1
Admiral;	1
"but	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
saying	1
which.	1
He	1
has	1
been	1
running	1
after	1
them,	1
too,	1
long	1
enough,	1
one	1
would	1
think,	1
to	1
make	1
up	1
his	1
mind.	1
Ay,	1
this	1
comes	1
of	1
the	1
peace.	1
If	1
it	1
were	1
war	1
now,	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
settled	1
it	1
long	1
ago.	1
We	1
sailors,	1
Miss	1
Elliot,	1
cannot	1
afford	1
to	1
make	1
long	1
courtships	1
in	1
time	1
of	1
war.	1
How	1
many	1
days	1
was	1
it,	1
my	1
dear,	1
between	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
of	1
my	1
seeing	1
you	1
and	1
our	1
sitting	1
down	1
together	1
in	1
our	1
lodgings	1
at	1
North	1
Yarmouth?"	1
"We	1
had	1
better	1
not	1
talk	1
about	1
it,	1
my	1
dear,"	1
replied	1
Mrs	1
Croft,	1
pleasantly;	1
"for	1
if	1
Miss	1
Elliot	1
were	1
to	1
hear	1
how	1
soon	1
we	1
came	1
to	1
an	1
understanding,	1
she	1
would	1
never	1
be	1
persuaded	1
that	1
we	1
could	1
be	1
happy	1
together.	1
I	1
had	1
known	1
you	1
by	1
character,	1
however,	1
long	1
before."	1
"Well,	1
and	1
I	1
had	1
heard	1
of	1
you	1
as	1
a	1
very	1
pretty	1
girl,	1
and	1
what	1
were	1
we	1
to	1
wait	1
for	1
besides?	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
like	1
having	1
such	1
things	1
so	1
long	1
in	1
hand.	1
I	1
wish	1
Frederick	1
would	1
spread	1
a	1
little	1
more	1
canvass,	1
and	1
bring	1
us	1
home	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
young	1
ladies	1
to	1
Kellynch.	1
Then	1
there	1
would	1
always	1
be	1
company	1
for	1
them.	1
And	1
very	1
nice	1
young	1
ladies	1
they	1
both	1
are;	1
I	1
hardly	1
know	1
one	1
from	1
the	1
other."	1
"Very	1
good	1
humoured,	1
unaffected	1
girls,	1
indeed,"	1
said	1
Mrs	1
Croft,	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
of	1
calmer	1
praise,	1
such	1
as	1
made	1
Anne	1
suspect	1
that	1
her	1
keener	1
powers	1
might	1
not	1
consider	1
either	1
of	1
them	1
as	1
quite	1
worthy	1
of	1
her	1
brother;	1
"and	1
a	1
very	1
respectable	1
family.	1
One	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
connected	1
with	1
better	1
people.	1
My	1
dear	1
Admiral,	1
that	1
post!	1
we	1
shall	1
certainly	1
take	1
that	1
post."	1
But	1
by	1
coolly	1
giving	1
the	1
reins	1
a	1
better	1
direction	1
herself	1
they	1
happily	1
passed	1
the	1
danger;	1
and	1
by	1
once	1
afterwards	1
judiciously	1
putting	1
out	1
her	1
hand	1
they	1
neither	1
fell	1
into	1
a	1
rut,	1
nor	1
ran	1
foul	1
of	1
a	1
dung-cart;	1
and	1
Anne,	1
with	1
some	1
amusement	1
at	1
their	1
style	1
of	1
driving,	1
which	1
she	1
imagined	1
no	1
bad	1
representation	1
of	1
the	1
general	1
guidance	1
of	1
their	1
affairs,	1
found	1
herself	1
safely	1
deposited	1
by	1
them	1
at	1
the	1
Cottage.	1
Chapter	1
11	1
The	1
time	1
now	1
approached	1
for	1
Lady	1
Russell's	1
return:	1
the	1
day	1
was	1
even	1
fixed;	1
and	1
Anne,	1
being	1
engaged	1
to	1
join	1
her	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
resettled,	1
was	1
looking	1
forward	1
to	1
an	1
early	1
removal	1
to	1
Kellynch,	1
and	1
beginning	1
to	1
think	1
how	1
her	1
own	1
comfort	1
was	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
affected	1
by	1
it.	1
It	1
would	1
place	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
village	1
with	1
Captain	1
Wentworth,	1
within	1
half	1
a	1
mile	1
of	1
him;	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
frequent	1
the	1
same	1
church,	1
and	1
there	1
must	1
be	1
intercourse	1
between	1
the	1
two	1
families.	1
This	1
was	1
against	1
her;	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
hand,	1
he	1
spent	1
so	1
much	1
of	1
his	1
time	1
at	1
Uppercross,	1
that	1
in	1
removing	1
thence	1
she	1
might	1
be	1
considered	1
rather	1
as	1
leaving	1
him	1
behind,	1
than	1
as	1
going	1
towards	1
him;	1
and,	1
upon	1
the	1
whole,	1
she	1
believed	1
she	1
must,	1
on	1
this	1
interesting	1
question,	1
be	1
the	1
gainer,	1
almost	1
as	1
certainly	1
as	1
in	1
her	1
change	1
of	1
domestic	1
society,	1
in	1
leaving	1
poor	1
Mary	1
for	1
Lady	1
Russell.	1
She	1
wished	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
possible	1
for	1
her	1
to	1
avoid	1
ever	1
seeing	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
at	1
the	1
Hall:	1
those	1
rooms	1
had	1
witnessed	1
former	1
meetings	1
which	1
would	1
be	1
brought	1
too	1
painfully	1
before	1
her;	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
yet	1
more	1
anxious	1
for	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
Lady	1
Russell	1
and	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
never	1
meeting	1
anywhere.	1
They	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
each	1
other,	1
and	1
no	1
renewal	1
of	1
acquaintance	1
now	1
could	1
do	1
any	1
good;	1
and	1
were	1
Lady	1
Russell	1
to	1
see	1
them	1
together,	1
she	1
might	1
think	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
too	1
much	1
self-possession,	1
and	1
she	1
too	1
little.	1
These	1
points	1
formed	1
her	1
chief	1
solicitude	1
in	1
anticipating	1
her	1
removal	1
from	1
Uppercross,	1
where	1
she	1
felt	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
stationed	1
quite	1
long	1
enough.	1
Her	1
usefulness	1
to	1
little	1
Charles	1
would	1
always	1
give	1
some	1
sweetness	1
to	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
her	1
two	1
months'	1
visit	1
there,	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
gaining	1
strength	1
apace,	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
nothing	1
else	1
to	1
stay	1
for.	1
The	1
conclusion	1
of	1
her	1
visit,	1
however,	1
was	1
diversified	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
imagined.	1
Captain	1
Wentworth,	1
after	1
being	1
unseen	1
and	1
unheard	1
of	1
at	1
Uppercross	1
for	1
two	1
whole	1
days,	1
appeared	1
again	1
among	1
them	1
to	1
justify	1
himself	1
by	1
a	1
relation	1
of	1
what	1
had	1
kept	1
him	1
away.	1
A	1
letter	1
from	1
his	1
friend,	1
Captain	1
Harville,	1
having	1
found	1
him	1
out	1
at	1
last,	1
had	1
brought	1
intelligence	1
of	1
Captain	1
Harville's	1
being	1
settled	1
with	1
his	1
family	1
at	1
Lyme	1
for	1
the	1
winter;	1
of	1
their	1
being	1
therefore,	1
quite	1
unknowingly,	1
within	1
twenty	1
miles	1
of	1
each	1
other.	1
Captain	1
Harville	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
in	1
good	1
health	1
since	1
a	1
severe	1
wound	1
which	1
he	1
received	1
two	1
years	1
before,	1
and	1
Captain	1
Wentworth's	1
anxiety	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
had	1
determined	1
him	1
to	1
go	1
immediately	1
to	1
Lyme.	1
He	1
had	1
been	1
there	1
for	1
four-and-twenty	1
hours.	1
His	1
acquittal	1
was	1
complete,	1
his	1
friendship	1
warmly	1
honoured,	1
a	1
lively	1
interest	1
excited	1
for	1
his	1
friend,	1
and	1
his	1
description	1
of	1
the	1
fine	1
country	1
about	1
Lyme	1
so	1
feelingly	1
attended	1
to	1
by	1
the	1
party,	1
that	1
an	1
earnest	1
desire	1
to	1
see	1
Lyme	1
themselves,	1
and	1
a	1
project	1
for	1
going	1
thither	1
was	1
the	1
consequence.	1
The	1
young	1
people	1
were	1
all	1
wild	1
to	1
see	1
Lyme.	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
talked	1
of	1
going	1
there	1
again	1
himself,	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
seventeen	1
miles	1
from	1
Uppercross;	1
though	1
November,	1
the	1
weather	1
was	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
bad;	1
and,	1
in	1
short,	1
Louisa,	1
who	1
was	1
the	1
most	1
eager	1
of	1
the	1
eager,	1
having	1
formed	1
the	1
resolution	1
to	1
go,	1
and	1
besides	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
doing	1
as	1
she	1
liked,	1
being	1
now	1
armed	1
with	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
merit	1
in	1
maintaining	1
her	1
own	1
way,	1
bore	1
down	1
all	1
the	1
wishes	1
of	1
her	1
father	1
and	1
mother	1
for	1
putting	1
it	1
off	1
till	1
summer;	1
and	1
to	1
Lyme	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
go--Charles,	1
Mary,	1
Anne,	1
Henrietta,	1
Louisa,	1
and	1
Captain	1
Wentworth.	1
The	1
first	1
heedless	1
scheme	1
had	1
been	1
to	1
go	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
and	1
return	1
at	1
night;	1
but	1
to	1
this	1
Mr	1
Musgrove,	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
his	1
horses,	1
would	1
not	1
consent;	1
and	1
when	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
be	1
rationally	1
considered,	1
a	1
day	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
November	1
would	1
not	1
leave	1
much	1
time	1
for	1
seeing	1
a	1
new	1
place,	1
after	1
deducting	1
seven	1
hours,	1
as	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
required,	1
for	1
going	1
and	1
returning.	1
They	1
were,	1
consequently,	1
to	1
stay	1
the	1
night	1
there,	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
expected	1
back	1
till	1
the	1
next	1
day's	1
dinner.	1
This	1
was	1
felt	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
considerable	1
amendment;	1
and	1
though	1
they	1
all	1
met	1
at	1
the	1
Great	1
House	1
at	1
rather	1
an	1
early	1
breakfast	1
hour,	1
and	1
set	1
off	1
very	1
punctually,	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
much	1
past	1
noon	1
before	1
the	1
two	1
carriages,	1
Mr	1
Musgrove's	1
coach	1
containing	1
the	1
four	1
ladies,	1
and	1
Charles's	1
curricle,	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
drove	1
Captain	1
Wentworth,	1
were	1
descending	1
the	1
long	1
hill	1
into	1
Lyme,	1
and	1
entering	1
upon	1
the	1
still	1
steeper	1
street	1
of	1
the	1
town	1
itself,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
very	1
evident	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
more	1
than	1
time	1
for	1
looking	1
about	1
them,	1
before	1
the	1
light	1
and	1
warmth	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
were	1
gone.	1
After	1
securing	1
accommodations,	1
and	1
ordering	1
a	1
dinner	1
at	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
inns,	1
the	1
next	1
thing	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
was	1
unquestionably	1
to	1
walk	1
directly	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
sea.	1
They	1
were	1
come	1
too	1
late	1
in	1
the	1
year	1
for	1
any	1
amusement	1
or	1
variety	1
which	1
Lyme,	1
as	1
a	1
public	1
place,	1
might	1
offer.	1
The	1
rooms	1
were	1
shut	1
up,	1
the	1
lodgers	1
almost	1
all	1
gone,	1
scarcely	1
any	1
family	1
but	1
of	1
the	1
residents	1
left;	1
and,	1
as	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
to	1
admire	1
in	1
the	1
buildings	1
themselves,	1
the	1
remarkable	1
situation	1
of	1
the	1
town,	1
the	1
principal	1
street	1
almost	1
hurrying	1
into	1
the	1
water,	1
the	1
walk	1
to	1
the	1
Cobb,	1
skirting	1
round	1
the	1
pleasant	1
little	1
bay,	1
which,	1
in	1
the	1
season,	1
is	1
animated	1
with	1
bathing	1
machines	1
and	1
company;	1
the	1
Cobb	1
itself,	1
its	1
old	1
wonders	1
and	1
new	1
improvements,	1
with	1
the	1
very	1
beautiful	1
line	1
of	1
cliffs	1
stretching	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
east	1
of	1
the	1
town,	1
are	1
what	1
the	1
stranger's	1
eye	1
will	1
seek;	1
and	1
a	1
very	1
strange	1
stranger	1
it	1
must	1
be,	1
who	1
does	1
not	1
see	1
charms	1
in	1
the	1
immediate	1
environs	1
of	1
Lyme,	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
wish	1
to	1
know	1
it	1
better.	1
The	1
scenes	1
in	1
its	1
neighbourhood,	1
Charmouth,	1
with	1
its	1
high	1
grounds	1
and	1
extensive	1
sweeps	1
of	1
country,	1
and	1
still	1
more,	1
its	1
sweet,	1
retired	1
bay,	1
backed	1
by	1
dark	1
cliffs,	1
where	1
fragments	1
of	1
low	1
rock	1
among	1
the	1
sands,	1
make	1
it	1
the	1
happiest	1
spot	1
for	1
watching	1
the	1
flow	1
of	1
the	1
tide,	1
for	1
sitting	1
in	1
unwearied	1
contemplation;	1
the	1
woody	1
varieties	1
of	1
the	1
cheerful	1
village	1
of	1
Up	1
Lyme;	1
and,	1
above	1
all,	1
Pinny,	1
with	1
its	1
green	1
chasms	1
between	1
romantic	1
rocks,	1
where	1
the	1
scattered	1
forest	1
trees	1
and	1
orchards	1
of	1
luxuriant	1
growth,	1
declare	1
that	1
many	1
a	1
generation	1
must	1
have	1
passed	1
away	1
since	1
the	1
first	1
partial	1
falling	1
of	1
the	1
cliff	1
prepared	1
the	1
ground	1
for	1
such	1
a	1
state,	1
where	1
a	1
scene	1
so	1
wonderful	1
and	1
so	1
lovely	1
is	1
exhibited,	1
as	1
may	1
more	1
than	1
equal	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
resembling	1
scenes	1
of	1
the	1
far-famed	1
Isle	1
of	1
Wight:	1
these	1
places	1
must	1
be	1
visited,	1
and	1
visited	1
again,	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
worth	1
of	1
Lyme	1
understood.	1
The	1
party	1
from	1
Uppercross	1
passing	1
down	1
by	1
the	1
now	1
deserted	1
and	1
melancholy	1
looking	1
rooms,	1
and	1
still	1
descending,	1
soon	1
found	1
themselves	1
on	1
the	1
sea-shore;	1
and	1
lingering	1
only,	1
as	1
all	1
must	1
linger	1
and	1
gaze	1
on	1
a	1
first	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
sea,	1
who	1
ever	1
deserved	1
to	1
look	1
on	1
it	1
at	1
all,	1
proceeded	1
towards	1
the	1
Cobb,	1
equally	1
their	1
object	1
in	1
itself	1
and	1
on	1
Captain	1
Wentworth's	1
account:	1
for	1
in	1
a	1
small	1
house,	1
near	1
the	1
foot	1
of	1
an	1
old	1
pier	1
of	1
unknown	1
date,	1
were	1
the	1
Harvilles	1
settled.	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
turned	1
in	1
to	1
call	1
on	1
his	1
friend;	1
the	1
others	1
walked	1
on,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
join	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
Cobb.	1
They	1
were	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
tired	1
of	1
wondering	1
and	1
admiring;	1
and	1
not	1
even	1
Louisa	1
seemed	1
to	1
feel	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
parted	1
with	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
long,	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
him	1
coming	1
after	1
them,	1
with	1
three	1
companions,	1
all	1
well	1
known	1
already,	1
by	1
description,	1
to	1
be	1
Captain	1
and	1
Mrs	1
Harville,	1
and	1
a	1
Captain	1
Benwick,	1
who	1
was	1
staying	1
with	1
them.	1
Captain	1
Benwick	1
had	1
some	1
time	1
ago	1
been	1
first	1
lieutenant	1
of	1
the	1
Laconia;	1
and	1
the	1
account	1
which	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
had	1
given	1
of	1
him,	1
on	1
his	1
return	1
from	1
Lyme	1
before,	1
his	1
warm	1
praise	1
of	1
him	1
as	1
an	1
excellent	1
young	1
man	1
and	1
an	1
officer,	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
always	1
valued	1
highly,	1
which	1
must	1
have	1
stamped	1
him	1
well	1
in	1
the	1
esteem	1
of	1
every	1
listener,	1
had	1
been	1
followed	1
by	1
a	1
little	1
history	1
of	1
his	1
private	1
life,	1
which	1
rendered	1
him	1
perfectly	1
interesting	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
ladies.	1
He	1
had	1
been	1
engaged	1
to	1
Captain	1
Harville's	1
sister,	1
and	1
was	1
now	1
mourning	1
her	1
loss.	1
They	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
year	1
or	1
two	1
waiting	1
for	1
fortune	1
and	1
promotion.	1
Fortune	1
came,	1
his	1
prize-money	1
as	1
lieutenant	1
being	1
great;	1
promotion,	1
too,	1
came	1
at	1
last;	1
but	1
Fanny	1
Harville	1
did	1
not	1
live	1
to	1
know	1
it.	1
She	1
had	1
died	1
the	1
preceding	1
summer	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
sea.	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
believed	1
it	1
impossible	1
for	1
man	1
to	1
be	1
more	1
attached	1
to	1
woman	1
than	1
poor	1
Benwick	1
had	1
been	1
to	1
Fanny	1
Harville,	1
or	1
to	1
be	1
more	1
deeply	1
afflicted	1
under	1
the	1
dreadful	1
change.	1
He	1
considered	1
his	1
disposition	1
as	1
of	1
the	1
sort	1
which	1
must	1
suffer	1
heavily,	1
uniting	1
very	1
strong	1
feelings	1
with	1
quiet,	1
serious,	1
and	1
retiring	1
manners,	1
and	1
a	1
decided	1
taste	1
for	1
reading,	1
and	1
sedentary	1
pursuits.	1
To	1
finish	1
the	1
interest	1
of	1
the	1
story,	1
the	1
friendship	1
between	1
him	1
and	1
the	1
Harvilles	1
seemed,	1
if	1
possible,	1
augmented	1
by	1
the	1
event	1
which	1
closed	1
all	1
their	1
views	1
of	1
alliance,	1
and	1
Captain	1
Benwick	1
was	1
now	1
living	1
with	1
them	1
entirely.	1
Captain	1
Harville	1
had	1
taken	1
his	1
present	1
house	1
for	1
half	1
a	1
year;	1
his	1
taste,	1
and	1
his	1
health,	1
and	1
his	1
fortune,	1
all	1
directing	1
him	1
to	1
a	1
residence	1
inexpensive,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
sea;	1
and	1
the	1
grandeur	1
of	1
the	1
country,	1
and	1
the	1
retirement	1
of	1
Lyme	1
in	1
the	1
winter,	1
appeared	1
exactly	1
adapted	1
to	1
Captain	1
Benwick's	1
state	1
of	1
mind.	1
The	1
sympathy	1
and	1
good-will	1
excited	1
towards	1
Captain	1
Benwick	1
was	1
very	1
great.	1
"And	1
yet,"	1
said	1
Anne	1
to	1
herself,	1
as	1
they	1
now	1
moved	1
forward	1
to	1
meet	1
the	1
party,	1
"he	1
has	1
not,	1
perhaps,	1
a	1
more	1
sorrowing	1
heart	1
than	1
I	1
have.	1
I	1
cannot	1
believe	1
his	1
prospects	1
so	1
blighted	1
for	1
ever.	1
He	1
is	1
younger	1
than	1
I	1
am;	1
younger	1
in	1
feeling,	1
if	1
not	1
in	1
fact;	1
younger	1
as	1
a	1
man.	1
He	1
will	1
rally	1
again,	1
and	1
be	1
happy	1
with	1
another."	1
They	1
all	1
met,	1
and	1
were	1
introduced.	1
Captain	1
Harville	1
was	1
a	1
tall,	1
dark	1
man,	1
with	1
a	1
sensible,	1
benevolent	1
countenance;	1
a	1
little	1
lame;	1
and	1
from	1
strong	1
features	1
and	1
want	1
of	1
health,	1
looking	1
much	1
older	1
than	1
Captain	1
Wentworth.	1
Captain	1
Benwick	1
looked,	1
and	1
was,	1
the	1
youngest	1
of	1
the	1
three,	1
and,	1
compared	1
with	1
either	1
of	1
them,	1
a	1
little	1
man.	1
He	1
had	1
a	1
pleasing	1
face	1
and	1
a	1
melancholy	1
air,	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
have,	1
and	1
drew	1
back	1
from	1
conversation.	1
Captain	1
Harville,	1
though	1
not	1
equalling	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
in	1
manners,	1
was	1
a	1
perfect	1
gentleman,	1
unaffected,	1
warm,	1
and	1
obliging.	1
Mrs	1
Harville,	1
a	1
degree	1
less	1
polished	1
than	1
her	1
husband,	1
seemed,	1
however,	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
same	1
good	1
feelings;	1
and	1
nothing	1
could	1
be	1
more	1
pleasant	1
than	1
their	1
desire	1
of	1
considering	1
the	1
whole	1
party	1
as	1
friends	1
of	1
their	1
own,	1
because	1
the	1
friends	1
of	1
Captain	1
Wentworth,	1
or	1
more	1
kindly	1
hospitable	1
than	1
their	1
entreaties	1
for	1
their	1
all	1
promising	1
to	1
dine	1
with	1
them.	1
The	1
dinner,	1
already	1
ordered	1
at	1
the	1
inn,	1
was	1
at	1
last,	1
though	1
unwillingly,	1
accepted	1
as	1
a	1
excuse;	1
but	1
they	1
seemed	1
almost	1
hurt	1
that	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
should	1
have	1
brought	1
any	1
such	1
party	1
to	1
Lyme,	1
without	1
considering	1
it	1
as	1
a	1
thing	1
of	1
course	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
dine	1
with	1
them.	1
There	1
was	1
so	1
much	1
attachment	1
to	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
in	1
all	1
this,	1
and	1
such	1
a	1
bewitching	1
charm	1
in	1
a	1
degree	1
of	1
hospitality	1
so	1
uncommon,	1
so	1
unlike	1
the	1
usual	1
style	1
of	1
give-and-take	1
invitations,	1
and	1
dinners	1
of	1
formality	1
and	1
display,	1
that	1
Anne	1
felt	1
her	1
spirits	1
not	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
benefited	1
by	1
an	1
increasing	1
acquaintance	1
among	1
his	1
brother-officers.	1
"These	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
all	1
my	1
friends,"	1
was	1
her	1
thought;	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
to	1
struggle	1
against	1
a	1
great	1
tendency	1
to	1
lowness.	1
On	1
quitting	1
the	1
Cobb,	1
they	1
all	1
went	1
in-doors	1
with	1
their	1
new	1
friends,	1
and	1
found	1
rooms	1
so	1
small	1
as	1
none	1
but	1
those	1
who	1
invite	1
from	1
the	1
heart	1
could	1
think	1
capable	1
of	1
accommodating	1
so	1
many.	1
Anne	1
had	1
a	1
moment's	1
astonishment	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
herself;	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
soon	1
lost	1
in	1
the	1
pleasanter	1
feelings	1
which	1
sprang	1
from	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
ingenious	1
contrivances	1
and	1
nice	1
arrangements	1
of	1
Captain	1
Harville,	1
to	1
turn	1
the	1
actual	1
space	1
to	1
the	1
best	1
account,	1
to	1
supply	1
the	1
deficiencies	1
of	1
lodging-house	1
furniture,	1
and	1
defend	1
the	1
windows	1
and	1
doors	1
against	1
the	1
winter	1
storms	1
to	1
be	1
expected.	1
The	1
varieties	1
in	1
the	1
fitting-up	1
of	1
the	1
rooms,	1
where	1
the	1
common	1
necessaries	1
provided	1
by	1
the	1
owner,	1
in	1
the	1
common	1
indifferent	1
plight,	1
were	1
contrasted	1
with	1
some	1
few	1
articles	1
of	1
a	1
rare	1
species	1
of	1
wood,	1
excellently	1
worked	1
up,	1
and	1
with	1
something	1
curious	1
and	1
valuable	1
from	1
all	1
the	1
distant	1
countries	1
Captain	1
Harville	1
had	1
visited,	1
were	1
more	1
than	1
amusing	1
to	1
Anne;	1
connected	1
as	1
it	1
all	1
was	1
with	1
his	1
profession,	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
its	1
labours,	1
the	1
effect	1
of	1
its	1
influence	1
on	1
his	1
habits,	1
the	1
picture	1
of	1
repose	1
and	1
domestic	1
happiness	1
it	1
presented,	1
made	1
it	1
to	1
her	1
a	1
something	1
more,	1
or	1
less,	1
than	1
gratification.	1
Captain	1
Harville	1
was	1
no	1
reader;	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
contrived	1
excellent	1
accommodations,	1
and	1
fashioned	1
very	1
pretty	1
shelves,	1
for	1
a	1
tolerable	1
collection	1
of	1
well-bound	1
volumes,	1
the	1
property	1
of	1
Captain	1
Benwick.	1
His	1
lameness	1
prevented	1
him	1
from	1
taking	1
much	1
exercise;	1
but	1
a	1
mind	1
of	1
usefulness	1
and	1
ingenuity	1
seemed	1
to	1
furnish	1
him	1
with	1
constant	1
employment	1
within.	1
He	1
drew,	1
he	1
varnished,	1
he	1
carpentered,	1
he	1
glued;	1
he	1
made	1
toys	1
for	1
the	1
children;	1
he	1
fashioned	1
new	1
netting-needles	1
and	1
pins	1
with	1
improvements;	1
and	1
if	1
everything	1
else	1
was	1
done,	1
sat	1
down	1
to	1
his	1
large	1
fishing-net	1
at	1
one	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
room.	1
Anne	1
thought	1
she	1
left	1
great	1
happiness	1
behind	1
her	1
when	1
they	1
quitted	1
the	1
house;	1
and	1
Louisa,	1
by	1
whom	1
she	1
found	1
herself	1
walking,	1
burst	1
forth	1
into	1
raptures	1
of	1
admiration	1
and	1
delight	1
on	1
the	1
character	1
of	1
the	1
navy;	1
their	1
friendliness,	1
their	1
brotherliness,	1
their	1
openness,	1
their	1
uprightness;	1
protesting	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
convinced	1
of	1
sailors	1
having	1
more	1
worth	1
and	1
warmth	1
than	1
any	1
other	1
set	1
of	1
men	1
in	1
England;	1
that	1
they	1
only	1
knew	1
how	1
to	1
live,	1
and	1
they	1
only	1
deserved	1
to	1
be	1
respected	1
and	1
loved.	1
They	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
dress	1
and	1
dine;	1
and	1
so	1
well	1
had	1
the	1
scheme	1
answered	1
already,	1
that	1
nothing	1
was	1
found	1
amiss;	1
though	1
its	1
being	1
"so	1
entirely	1
out	1
of	1
season,"	1
and	1
the	1
"no	1
thoroughfare	1
of	1
Lyme,"	1
and	1
the	1
"no	1
expectation	1
of	1
company,"	1
had	1
brought	1
many	1
apologies	1
from	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
the	1
inn.	1
Anne	1
found	1
herself	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
growing	1
so	1
much	1
more	1
hardened	1
to	1
being	1
in	1
Captain	1
Wentworth's	1
company	1
than	1
she	1
had	1
at	1
first	1
imagined	1
could	1
ever	1
be,	1
that	1
the	1
sitting	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
table	1
with	1
him	1
now,	1
and	1
the	1
interchange	1
of	1
the	1
common	1
civilities	1
attending	1
on	1
it	1
(they	1
never	1
got	1
beyond),	1
was	1
become	1
a	1
mere	1
nothing.	1
The	1
nights	1
were	1
too	1
dark	1
for	1
the	1
ladies	1
to	1
meet	1
again	1
till	1
the	1
morrow,	1
but	1
Captain	1
Harville	1
had	1
promised	1
them	1
a	1
visit	1
in	1
the	1
evening;	1
and	1
he	1
came,	1
bringing	1
his	1
friend	1
also,	1
which	1
was	1
more	1
than	1
had	1
been	1
expected,	1
it	1
having	1
been	1
agreed	1
that	1
Captain	1
Benwick	1
had	1
all	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
being	1
oppressed	1
by	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
so	1
many	1
strangers.	1
He	1
ventured	1
among	1
them	1
again,	1
however,	1
though	1
his	1
spirits	1
certainly	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
fit	1
for	1
the	1
mirth	1
of	1
the	1
party	1
in	1
general.	1
While	1
Captains	1
Wentworth	1
and	1
Harville	1
led	1
the	1
talk	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
room,	1
and	1
by	1
recurring	1
to	1
former	1
days,	1
supplied	1
anecdotes	1
in	1
abundance	1
to	1
occupy	1
and	1
entertain	1
the	1
others,	1
it	1
fell	1
to	1
Anne's	1
lot	1
to	1
be	1
placed	1
rather	1
apart	1
with	1
Captain	1
Benwick;	1
and	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
impulse	1
of	1
her	1
nature	1
obliged	1
her	1
to	1
begin	1
an	1
acquaintance	1
with	1
him.	1
He	1
was	1
shy,	1
and	1
disposed	1
to	1
abstraction;	1
but	1
the	1
engaging	1
mildness	1
of	1
her	1
countenance,	1
and	1
gentleness	1
of	1
her	1
manners,	1
soon	1
had	1
their	1
effect;	1
and	1
Anne	1
was	1
well	1
repaid	1
the	1
first	1
trouble	1
of	1
exertion.	1
He	1
was	1
evidently	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
of	1
considerable	1
taste	1
in	1
reading,	1
though	1
principally	1
in	1
poetry;	1
and	1
besides	1
the	1
persuasion	1
of	1
having	1
given	1
him	1
at	1
least	1
an	1
evening's	1
indulgence	1
in	1
the	1
discussion	1
of	1
subjects,	1
which	1
his	1
usual	1
companions	1
had	1
probably	1
no	1
concern	1
in,	1
she	1
had	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
being	1
of	1
real	1
use	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
some	1
suggestions	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
duty	1
and	1
benefit	1
of	1
struggling	1
against	1
affliction,	1
which	1
had	1
naturally	1
grown	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
conversation.	1
For,	1
though	1
shy,	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
reserved;	1
it	1
had	1
rather	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
feelings	1
glad	1
to	1
burst	1
their	1
usual	1
restraints;	1
and	1
having	1
talked	1
of	1
poetry,	1
the	1
richness	1
of	1
the	1
present	1
age,	1
and	1
gone	1
through	1
a	1
brief	1
comparison	1
of	1
opinion	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
first-rate	1
poets,	1
trying	1
to	1
ascertain	1
whether	1
Marmion	1
or	1
The	1
Lady	1
of	1
the	1
Lake	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
preferred,	1
and	1
how	1
ranked	1
the	1
Giaour	1
and	1
The	1
Bride	1
of	1
Abydos;	1
and	1
moreover,	1
how	1
the	1
Giaour	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
pronounced,	1
he	1
showed	1
himself	1
so	1
intimately	1
acquainted	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
tenderest	1
songs	1
of	1
the	1
one	1
poet,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
impassioned	1
descriptions	1
of	1
hopeless	1
agony	1
of	1
the	1
other;	1
he	1
repeated,	1
with	1
such	1
tremulous	1
feeling,	1
the	1
various	1
lines	1
which	1
imaged	1
a	1
broken	1
heart,	1
or	1
a	1
mind	1
destroyed	1
by	1
wretchedness,	1
and	1
looked	1
so	1
entirely	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
meant	1
to	1
be	1
understood,	1
that	1
she	1
ventured	1
to	1
hope	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
always	1
read	1
only	1
poetry,	1
and	1
to	1
say,	1
that	1
she	1
thought	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
misfortune	1
of	1
poetry	1
to	1
be	1
seldom	1
safely	1
enjoyed	1
by	1
those	1
who	1
enjoyed	1
it	1
completely;	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
strong	1
feelings	1
which	1
alone	1
could	1
estimate	1
it	1
truly	1
were	1
the	1
very	1
feelings	1
which	1
ought	1
to	1
taste	1
it	1
but	1
sparingly.	1
His	1
looks	1
shewing	1
him	1
not	1
pained,	1
but	1
pleased	1
with	1
this	1
allusion	1
to	1
his	1
situation,	1
she	1
was	1
emboldened	1
to	1
go	1
on;	1
and	1
feeling	1
in	1
herself	1
the	1
right	1
of	1
seniority	1
of	1
mind,	1
she	1
ventured	1
to	1
recommend	1
a	1
larger	1
allowance	1
of	1
prose	1
in	1
his	1
daily	1
study;	1
and	1
on	1
being	1
requested	1
to	1
particularize,	1
mentioned	1
such	1
works	1
of	1
our	1
best	1
moralists,	1
such	1
collections	1
of	1
the	1
finest	1
letters,	1
such	1
memoirs	1
of	1
characters	1
of	1
worth	1
and	1
suffering,	1
as	1
occurred	1
to	1
her	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
as	1
calculated	1
to	1
rouse	1
and	1
fortify	1
the	1
mind	1
by	1
the	1
highest	1
precepts,	1
and	1
the	1
strongest	1
examples	1
of	1
moral	1
and	1
religious	1
endurances.	1
Captain	1
Benwick	1
listened	1
attentively,	1
and	1
seemed	1
grateful	1
for	1
the	1
interest	1
implied;	1
and	1
though	1
with	1
a	1
shake	1
of	1
the	1
head,	1
and	1
sighs	1
which	1
declared	1
his	1
little	1
faith	1
in	1
the	1
efficacy	1
of	1
any	1
books	1
on	1
grief	1
like	1
his,	1
noted	1
down	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
those	1
she	1
recommended,	1
and	1
promised	1
to	1
procure	1
and	1
read	1
them.	1
When	1
the	1
evening	1
was	1
over,	1
Anne	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
be	1
amused	1
at	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
her	1
coming	1
to	1
Lyme	1
to	1
preach	1
patience	1
and	1
resignation	1
to	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
whom	1
she	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
before;	1
nor	1
could	1
she	1
help	1
fearing,	1
on	1
more	1
serious	1
reflection,	1
that,	1
like	1
many	1
other	1
great	1
moralists	1
and	1
preachers,	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
eloquent	1
on	1
a	1
point	1
in	1
which	1
her	1
own	1
conduct	1
would	1
ill	1
bear	1
examination.	1
Chapter	1
12	1
Anne	1
and	1
Henrietta,	1
finding	1
themselves	1
the	1
earliest	1
of	1
the	1
party	1
the	1
next	1
morning,	1
agreed	1
to	1
stroll	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
sea	1
before	1
breakfast.	1
They	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
sands,	1
to	1
watch	1
the	1
flowing	1
of	1
the	1
tide,	1
which	1
a	1
fine	1
south-easterly	1
breeze	1
was	1
bringing	1
in	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
grandeur	1
which	1
so	1
flat	1
a	1
shore	1
admitted.	1
They	1
praised	1
the	1
morning;	1
gloried	1
in	1
the	1
sea;	1
sympathized	1
in	1
the	1
delight	1
of	1
the	1
fresh-feeling	1
breeze--and	1
were	1
silent;	1
till	1
Henrietta	1
suddenly	1
began	1
again	1
with--	1
"Oh!	1
yes,--I	1
am	1
quite	1
convinced	1
that,	1
with	1
very	1
few	1
exceptions,	1
the	1
sea-air	1
always	1
does	1
good.	1
There	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
doubt	1
of	1
its	1
having	1
been	1
of	1
the	1
greatest	1
service	1
to	1
Dr	1
Shirley,	1
after	1
his	1
illness,	1
last	1
spring	1
twelve-month.	1
He	1
declares	1
himself,	1
that	1
coming	1
to	1
Lyme	1
for	1
a	1
month,	1
did	1
him	1
more	1
good	1
than	1
all	1
the	1
medicine	1
he	1
took;	1
and,	1
that	1
being	1
by	1
the	1
sea,	1
always	1
makes	1
him	1
feel	1
young	1
again.	1
Now,	1
I	1
cannot	1
help	1
thinking	1
it	1
a	1
pity	1
that	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
live	1
entirely	1
by	1
the	1
sea.	1
I	1
do	1
think	1
he	1
had	1
better	1
leave	1
Uppercross	1
entirely,	1
and	1
fix	1
at	1
Lyme.	1
Do	1
not	1
you,	1
Anne?	1
Do	1
not	1
you	1
agree	1
with	1
me,	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
best	1
thing	1
he	1
could	1
do,	1
both	1
for	1
himself	1
and	1
Mrs	1
Shirley?	1
She	1
has	1
cousins	1
here,	1
you	1
know,	1
and	1
many	1
acquaintance,	1
which	1
would	1
make	1
it	1
cheerful	1
for	1
her,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
she	1
would	1
be	1
glad	1
to	1
get	1
to	1
a	1
place	1
where	1
she	1
could	1
have	1
medical	1
attendance	1
at	1
hand,	1
in	1
case	1
of	1
his	1
having	1
another	1
seizure.	1
Indeed	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
quite	1
melancholy	1
to	1
have	1
such	1
excellent	1
people	1
as	1
Dr	1
and	1
Mrs	1
Shirley,	1
who	1
have	1
been	1
doing	1
good	1
all	1
their	1
lives,	1
wearing	1
out	1
their	1
last	1
days	1
in	1
a	1
place	1
like	1
Uppercross,	1
where,	1
excepting	1
our	1
family,	1
they	1
seem	1
shut	1
out	1
from	1
all	1
the	1
world.	1
I	1
wish	1
his	1
friends	1
would	1
propose	1
it	1
to	1
him.	1
I	1
really	1
think	1
they	1
ought.	1
And,	1
as	1
to	1
procuring	1
a	1
dispensation,	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
no	1
difficulty	1
at	1
his	1
time	1
of	1
life,	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
character.	1
My	1
only	1
doubt	1
is,	1
whether	1
anything	1
could	1
persuade	1
him	1
to	1
leave	1
his	1
parish.	1
He	1
is	1
so	1
very	1
strict	1
and	1
scrupulous	1
in	1
his	1
notions;	1
over-scrupulous	1
I	1
must	1
say.	1
Do	1
not	1
you	1
think,	1
Anne,	1
it	1
is	1
being	1
over-scrupulous?	1
Do	1
not	1
you	1
think	1
it	1
is	1
quite	1
a	1
mistaken	1
point	1
of	1
conscience,	1
when	1
a	1
clergyman	1
sacrifices	1
his	1
health	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
duties,	1
which	1
may	1
be	1
just	1
as	1
well	1
performed	1
by	1
another	1
person?	1
And	1
at	1
Lyme	1
too,	1
only	1
seventeen	1
miles	1
off,	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
near	1
enough	1
to	1
hear,	1
if	1
people	1
thought	1
there	1
was	1
anything	1
to	1
complain	1
of."	1
Anne	1
smiled	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
to	1
herself	1
during	1
this	1
speech,	1
and	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
subject,	1
as	1
ready	1
to	1
do	1
good	1
by	1
entering	1
into	1
the	1
feelings	1
of	1
a	1
young	1
lady	1
as	1
of	1
a	1
young	1
man,	1
though	1
here	1
it	1
was	1
good	1
of	1
a	1
lower	1
standard,	1
for	1
what	1
could	1
be	1
offered	1
but	1
general	1
acquiescence?	1
She	1
said	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
reasonable	1
and	1
proper	1
on	1
the	1
business;	1
felt	1
the	1
claims	1
of	1
Dr	1
Shirley	1
to	1
repose	1
as	1
she	1
ought;	1
saw	1
how	1
very	1
desirable	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
have	1
some	1
active,	1
respectable	1
young	1
man,	1
as	1
a	1
resident	1
curate,	1
and	1
was	1
even	1
courteous	1
enough	1
to	1
hint	1
at	1
the	1
advantage	1
of	1
such	1
resident	1
curate's	1
being	1
married.	1
"I	1
wish,"	1
said	1
Henrietta,	1
very	1
well	1
pleased	1
with	1
her	1
companion,	1
"I	1
wish	1
Lady	1
Russell	1
lived	1
at	1
Uppercross,	1
and	1
were	1
intimate	1
with	1
Dr	1
Shirley.	1
I	1
have	1
always	1
heard	1
of	1
Lady	1
Russell	1
as	1
a	1
woman	1
of	1
the	1
greatest	1
influence	1
with	1
everybody!	1
I	1
always	1
look	1
upon	1
her	1
as	1
able	1
to	1
persuade	1
a	1
person	1
to	1
anything!	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
of	1
her,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
told	1
you	1
before,	1
quite	1
afraid	1
of	1
her,	1
because	1
she	1
is	1
so	1
very	1
clever;	1
but	1
I	1
respect	1
her	1
amazingly,	1
and	1
wish	1
we	1
had	1
such	1
a	1
neighbour	1
at	1
Uppercross."	1
Anne	1
was	1
amused	1
by	1
Henrietta's	1
manner	1
of	1
being	1
grateful,	1
and	1
amused	1
also	1
that	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
events	1
and	1
the	1
new	1
interests	1
of	1
Henrietta's	1
views	1
should	1
have	1
placed	1
her	1
friend	1
at	1
all	1
in	1
favour	1
with	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
Musgrove	1
family;	1
she	1
had	1
only	1
time,	1
however,	1
for	1
a	1
general	1
answer,	1
and	1
a	1
wish	1
that	1
such	1
another	1
woman	1
were	1
at	1
Uppercross,	1
before	1
all	1
subjects	1
suddenly	1
ceased,	1
on	1
seeing	1
Louisa	1
and	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
coming	1
towards	1
them.	1
They	1
came	1
also	1
for	1
a	1
stroll	1
till	1
breakfast	1
was	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
ready;	1
but	1
Louisa	1
recollecting,	1
immediately	1
afterwards	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
something	1
to	1
procure	1
at	1
a	1
shop,	1
invited	1
them	1
all	1
to	1
go	1
back	1
with	1
her	1
into	1
the	1
town.	1
They	1
were	1
all	1
at	1
her	1
disposal.	1
When	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
steps,	1
leading	1
upwards	1
from	1
the	1
beach,	1
a	1
gentleman,	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
moment	1
preparing	1
to	1
come	1
down,	1
politely	1
drew	1
back,	1
and	1
stopped	1
to	1
give	1
them	1
way.	1
They	1
ascended	1
and	1
passed	1
him;	1
and	1
as	1
they	1
passed,	1
Anne's	1
face	1
caught	1
his	1
eye,	1
and	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
with	1
a	1
degree	1
of	1
earnest	1
admiration,	1
which	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
insensible	1
of.	1
She	1
was	1
looking	1
remarkably	1
well;	1
her	1
very	1
regular,	1
very	1
pretty	1
features,	1
having	1
the	1
bloom	1
and	1
freshness	1
of	1
youth	1
restored	1
by	1
the	1
fine	1
wind	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
blowing	1
on	1
her	1
complexion,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
animation	1
of	1
eye	1
which	1
it	1
had	1
also	1
produced.	1
It	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
the	1
gentleman,	1
(completely	1
a	1
gentleman	1
in	1
manner)	1
admired	1
her	1
exceedingly.	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
looked	1
round	1
at	1
her	1
instantly	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
which	1
shewed	1
his	1
noticing	1
of	1
it.	1
He	1
gave	1
her	1
a	1
momentary	1
glance,	1
a	1
glance	1
of	1
brightness,	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
say,	1
"That	1
man	1
is	1
struck	1
with	1
you,	1
and	1
even	1
I,	1
at	1
this	1
moment,	1
see	1
something	1
like	1
Anne	1
Elliot	1
again."	1
After	1
attending	1
Louisa	1
through	1
her	1
business,	1
and	1
loitering	1
about	1
a	1
little	1
longer,	1
they	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
inn;	1
and	1
Anne,	1
in	1
passing	1
afterwards	1
quickly	1
from	1
her	1
own	1
chamber	1
to	1
their	1
dining-room,	1
had	1
nearly	1
run	1
against	1
the	1
very	1
same	1
gentleman,	1
as	1
he	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
an	1
adjoining	1
apartment.	1
She	1
had	1
before	1
conjectured	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
stranger	1
like	1
themselves,	1
and	1
determined	1
that	1
a	1
well-looking	1
groom,	1
who	1
was	1
strolling	1
about	1
near	1
the	1
two	1
inns	1
as	1
they	1
came	1
back,	1
should	1
be	1
his	1
servant.	1
Both	1
master	1
and	1
man	1
being	1
in	1
mourning	1
assisted	1
the	1
idea.	1
It	1
was	1
now	1
proved	1
that	1
he	1
belonged	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
inn	1
as	1
themselves;	1
and	1
this	1
second	1
meeting,	1
short	1
as	1
it	1
was,	1
also	1
proved	1
again	1
by	1
the	1
gentleman's	1
looks,	1
that	1
he	1
thought	1
hers	1
very	1
lovely,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
readiness	1
and	1
propriety	1
of	1
his	1
apologies,	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
exceedingly	1
good	1
manners.	1
He	1
seemed	1
about	1
thirty,	1
and	1
though	1
not	1
handsome,	1
had	1
an	1
agreeable	1
person.	1
Anne	1
felt	1
that	1
she	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
know	1
who	1
he	1
was.	1
They	1
had	1
nearly	1
done	1
breakfast,	1
when	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
a	1
carriage,	1
(almost	1
the	1
first	1
they	1
had	1
heard	1
since	1
entering	1
Lyme)	1
drew	1
half	1
the	1
party	1
to	1
the	1
window.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
gentleman's	1
carriage,	1
a	1
curricle,	1
but	1
only	1
coming	1
round	1
from	1
the	1
stable-yard	1
to	1
the	1
front	1
door;	1
somebody	1
must	1
be	1
going	1
away.	1
It	1
was	1
driven	1
by	1
a	1
servant	1
in	1
mourning.	1
The	1
word	1
curricle	1
made	1
Charles	1
Musgrove	1
jump	1
up	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
compare	1
it	1
with	1
his	1
own;	1
the	1
servant	1
in	1
mourning	1
roused	1
Anne's	1
curiosity,	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
six	1
were	1
collected	1
to	1
look,	1
by	1
the	1
time	1
the	1
owner	1
of	1
the	1
curricle	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
issuing	1
from	1
the	1
door	1
amidst	1
the	1
bows	1
and	1
civilities	1
of	1
the	1
household,	1
and	1
taking	1
his	1
seat,	1
to	1
drive	1
off.	1
"Ah!"	1
cried	1
Captain	1
Wentworth,	1
instantly,	1
and	1
with	1
half	1
a	1
glance	1
at	1
Anne,	1
"it	1
is	1
the	1
very	1
man	1
we	1
passed."	1
The	1
Miss	1
Musgroves	1
agreed	1
to	1
it;	1
and	1
having	1
all	1
kindly	1
watched	1
him	1
as	1
far	1
up	1
the	1
hill	1
as	1
they	1
could,	1
they	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
breakfast	1
table.	1
The	1
waiter	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
soon	1
afterwards.	1
"Pray,"	1
said	1
Captain	1
Wentworth,	1
immediately,	1
"can	1
you	1
tell	1
us	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
gentleman	1
who	1
is	1
just	1
gone	1
away?"	1
"Yes,	1
Sir,	1
a	1
Mr	1
Elliot,	1
a	1
gentleman	1
of	1
large	1
fortune,	1
came	1
in	1
last	1
night	1
from	1
Sidmouth.	1
Dare	1
say	1
you	1
heard	1
the	1
carriage,	1
sir,	1
while	1
you	1
were	1
at	1
dinner;	1
and	1
going	1
on	1
now	1
for	1
Crewkherne,	1
in	1
his	1
way	1
to	1
Bath	1
and	1
London."	1
"Elliot!"	1
Many	1
had	1
looked	1
on	1
each	1
other,	1
and	1
many	1
had	1
repeated	1
the	1
name,	1
before	1
all	1
this	1
had	1
been	1
got	1
through,	1
even	1
by	1
the	1
smart	1
rapidity	1
of	1
a	1
waiter.	1
"Bless	1
me!"	1
cried	1
Mary;	1
"it	1
must	1
be	1
our	1
cousin;	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
our	1
Mr	1
Elliot,	1
it	1
must,	1
indeed!	1
Charles,	1
Anne,	1
must	1
not	1
it?	1
In	1
mourning,	1
you	1
see,	1
just	1
as	1
our	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
must	1
be.	1
How	1
very	1
extraordinary!	1
In	1
the	1
very	1
same	1
inn	1
with	1
us!	1
Anne,	1
must	1
not	1
it	1
be	1
our	1
Mr	1
Elliot?	1
my	1
father's	1
next	1
heir?	1
Pray	1
sir,"	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
waiter,	1
"did	1
not	1
you	1
hear,	1
did	1
not	1
his	1
servant	1
say	1
whether	1
he	1
belonged	1
to	1
the	1
Kellynch	1
family?"	1
"No,	1
ma'am,	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
mention	1
no	1
particular	1
family;	1
but	1
he	1
said	1
his	1
master	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
rich	1
gentleman,	1
and	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
baronight	1
some	1
day."	1
"There!	1
you	1
see!"	1
cried	1
Mary	1
in	1
an	1
ecstasy,	1
"just	1
as	1
I	1
said!	1
Heir	1
to	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
Elliot!	1
I	1
was	1
sure	1
that	1
would	1
come	1
out,	1
if	1
it	1
was	1
so.	1
Depend	1
upon	1
it,	1
that	1
is	1
a	1
circumstance	1
which	1
his	1
servants	1
take	1
care	1
to	1
publish,	1
wherever	1
he	1
goes.	1
But,	1
Anne,	1
only	1
conceive	1
how	1
extraordinary!	1
I	1
wish	1
I	1
had	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
more.	1
I	1
wish	1
we	1
had	1
been	1
aware	1
in	1
time,	1
who	1
it	1
was,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
introduced	1
to	1
us.	1
What	1
a	1
pity	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
introduced	1
to	1
each	1
other!	1
Do	1
you	1
think	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
Elliot	1
countenance?	1
I	1
hardly	1
looked	1
at	1
him,	1
I	1
was	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
horses;	1
but	1
I	1
think	1
he	1
had	1
something	1
of	1
the	1
Elliot	1
countenance,	1
I	1
wonder	1
the	1
arms	1
did	1
not	1
strike	1
me!	1
Oh!	1
the	1
great-coat	1
was	1
hanging	1
over	1
the	1
panel,	1
and	1
hid	1
the	1
arms,	1
so	1
it	1
did;	1
otherwise,	1
I	1
am	1
sure,	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
observed	1
them,	1
and	1
the	1
livery	1
too;	1
if	1
the	1
servant	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
in	1
mourning,	1
one	1
should	1
have	1
known	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
livery."	1
"Putting	1
all	1
these	1
very	1
extraordinary	1
circumstances	1
together,"	1
said	1
Captain	1
Wentworth,	1
"we	1
must	1
consider	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
arrangement	1
of	1
Providence,	1
that	1
you	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
introduced	1
to	1
your	1
cousin."	1
When	1
she	1
could	1
command	1
Mary's	1
attention,	1
Anne	1
quietly	1
tried	1
to	1
convince	1
her	1
that	1
their	1
father	1
and	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
had	1
not,	1
for	1
many	1
years,	1
been	1
on	1
such	1
terms	1
as	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
attempting	1
an	1
introduction	1
at	1
all	1
desirable.	1
At	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
however,	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
secret	1
gratification	1
to	1
herself	1
to	1
have	1
seen	1
her	1
cousin,	1
and	1
to	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
future	1
owner	1
of	1
Kellynch	1
was	1
undoubtedly	1
a	1
gentleman,	1
and	1
had	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
good	1
sense.	1
She	1
would	1
not,	1
upon	1
any	1
account,	1
mention	1
her	1
having	1
met	1
with	1
him	1
the	1
second	1
time;	1
luckily	1
Mary	1
did	1
not	1
much	1
attend	1
to	1
their	1
having	1
passed	1
close	1
by	1
him	1
in	1
their	1
earlier	1
walk,	1
but	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
felt	1
quite	1
ill-used	1
by	1
Anne's	1
having	1
actually	1
run	1
against	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
passage,	1
and	1
received	1
his	1
very	1
polite	1
excuses,	1
while	1
she	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
near	1
him	1
at	1
all;	1
no,	1
that	1
cousinly	1
little	1
interview	1
must	1
remain	1
a	1
perfect	1
secret.	1
"Of	1
course,"	1
said	1
Mary,	1
"you	1
will	1
mention	1
our	1
seeing	1
Mr	1
Elliot,	1
the	1
next	1
time	1
you	1
write	1
to	1
Bath.	1
I	1
think	1
my	1
father	1
certainly	1
ought	1
to	1
hear	1
of	1
it;	1
do	1
mention	1
all	1
about	1
him."	1
Anne	1
avoided	1
a	1
direct	1
reply,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
just	1
the	1
circumstance	1
which	1
she	1
considered	1
as	1
not	1
merely	1
unnecessary	1
to	1
be	1
communicated,	1
but	1
as	1
what	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
suppressed.	1
The	1
offence	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
given	1
her	1
father,	1
many	1
years	1
back,	1
she	1
knew;	1
Elizabeth's	1
particular	1
share	1
in	1
it	1
she	1
suspected;	1
and	1
that	1
Mr	1
Elliot's	1
idea	1
always	1
produced	1
irritation	1
in	1
both	1
was	1
beyond	1
a	1
doubt.	1
Mary	1
never	1
wrote	1
to	1
Bath	1
herself;	1
all	1
the	1
toil	1
of	1
keeping	1
up	1
a	1
slow	1
and	1
unsatisfactory	1
correspondence	1
with	1
Elizabeth	1
fell	1
on	1
Anne.	1
Breakfast	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
long	1
over,	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
joined	1
by	1
Captain	1
and	1
Mrs	1
Harville	1
and	1
Captain	1
Benwick;	1
with	1
whom	1
they	1
had	1
appointed	1
to	1
take	1
their	1
last	1
walk	1
about	1
Lyme.	1
They	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
setting	1
off	1
for	1
Uppercross	1
by	1
one,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
mean	1
while	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
all	1
together,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
doors	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
they	1
could.	1
Anne	1
found	1
Captain	1
Benwick	1
getting	1
near	1
her,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
fairly	1
in	1
the	1
street.	1
Their	1
conversation	1
the	1
preceding	1
evening	1
did	1
not	1
disincline	1
him	1
to	1
seek	1
her	1
again;	1
and	1
they	1
walked	1
together	1
some	1
time,	1
talking	1
as	1
before	1
of	1
Mr	1
Scott	1
and	1
Lord	1
Byron,	1
and	1
still	1
as	1
unable	1
as	1
before,	1
and	1
as	1
unable	1
as	1
any	1
other	1
two	1
readers,	1
to	1
think	1
exactly	1
alike	1
of	1
the	1
merits	1
of	1
either,	1
till	1
something	1
occasioned	1
an	1
almost	1
general	1
change	1
amongst	1
their	1
party,	1
and	1
instead	1
of	1
Captain	1
Benwick,	1
she	1
had	1
Captain	1
Harville	1
by	1
her	1
side.	1
"Miss	1
Elliot,"	1
said	1
he,	1
speaking	1
rather	1
low,	1
"you	1
have	1
done	1
a	1
good	1
deed	1
in	1
making	1
that	1
poor	1
fellow	1
talk	1
so	1
much.	1
I	1
wish	1
he	1
could	1
have	1
such	1
company	1
oftener.	1
It	1
is	1
bad	1
for	1
him,	1
I	1
know,	1
to	1
be	1
shut	1
up	1
as	1
he	1
is;	1
but	1
what	1
can	1
we	1
do?	1
We	1
cannot	1
part."	1
"No,"	1
said	1
Anne,	1
"that	1
I	1
can	1
easily	1
believe	1
to	1
be	1
impossible;	1
but	1
in	1
time,	1
perhaps--we	1
know	1
what	1
time	1
does	1
in	1
every	1
case	1
of	1
affliction,	1
and	1
you	1
must	1
remember,	1
Captain	1
Harville,	1
that	1
your	1
friend	1
may	1
yet	1
be	1
called	1
a	1
young	1
mourner--only	1
last	1
summer,	1
I	1
understand."	1
"Ay,	1
true	1
enough,"	1
(with	1
a	1
deep	1
sigh)	1
"only	1
June."	1
"And	1
not	1
known	1
to	1
him,	1
perhaps,	1
so	1
soon."	1
"Not	1
till	1
the	1
first	1
week	1
of	1
August,	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
home	1
from	1
the	1
Cape,	1
just	1
made	1
into	1
the	1
Grappler.	1
I	1
was	1
at	1
Plymouth	1
dreading	1
to	1
hear	1
of	1
him;	1
he	1
sent	1
in	1
letters,	1
but	1
the	1
Grappler	1
was	1
under	1
orders	1
for	1
Portsmouth.	1
There	1
the	1
news	1
must	1
follow	1
him,	1
but	1
who	1
was	1
to	1
tell	1
it?	1
not	1
I.	1
I	1
would	1
as	1
soon	1
have	1
been	1
run	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
yard-arm.	1
Nobody	1
could	1
do	1
it,	1
but	1
that	1
good	1
fellow"	1
(pointing	1
to	1
Captain	1
Wentworth.)	1
"The	1
Laconia	1
had	1
come	1
into	1
Plymouth	1
the	1
week	1
before;	1
no	1
danger	1
of	1
her	1
being	1
sent	1
to	1
sea	1
again.	1
He	1
stood	1
his	1
chance	1
for	1
the	1
rest;	1
wrote	1
up	1
for	1
leave	1
of	1
absence,	1
but	1
without	1
waiting	1
the	1
return,	1
travelled	1
night	1
and	1
day	1
till	1
he	1
got	1
to	1
Portsmouth,	1
rowed	1
off	1
to	1
the	1
Grappler	1
that	1
instant,	1
and	1
never	1
left	1
the	1
poor	1
fellow	1
for	1
a	1
week.	1
That's	1
what	1
he	1
did,	1
and	1
nobody	1
else	1
could	1
have	1
saved	1
poor	1
James.	1
You	1
may	1
think,	1
Miss	1
Elliot,	1
whether	1
he	1
is	1
dear	1
to	1
us!"	1
Anne	1
did	1
think	1
on	1
the	1
question	1
with	1
perfect	1
decision,	1
and	1
said	1
as	1
much	1
in	1
reply	1
as	1
her	1
own	1
feeling	1
could	1
accomplish,	1
or	1
as	1
his	1
seemed	1
able	1
to	1
bear,	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
too	1
much	1
affected	1
to	1
renew	1
the	1
subject,	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
spoke	1
again,	1
it	1
was	1
of	1
something	1
totally	1
different.	1
Mrs	1
Harville's	1
giving	1
it	1
as	1
her	1
opinion	1
that	1
her	1
husband	1
would	1
have	1
quite	1
walking	1
enough	1
by	1
the	1
time	1
he	1
reached	1
home,	1
determined	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
party	1
in	1
what	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
their	1
last	1
walk;	1
they	1
would	1
accompany	1
them	1
to	1
their	1
door,	1
and	1
then	1
return	1
and	1
set	1
off	1
themselves.	1
By	1
all	1
their	1
calculations	1
there	1
was	1
just	1
time	1
for	1
this;	1
but	1
as	1
they	1
drew	1
near	1
the	1
Cobb,	1
there	1
was	1
such	1
a	1
general	1
wish	1
to	1
walk	1
along	1
it	1
once	1
more,	1
all	1
were	1
so	1
inclined,	1
and	1
Louisa	1
soon	1
grew	1
so	1
determined,	1
that	1
the	1
difference	1
of	1
a	1
quarter	1
of	1
an	1
hour,	1
it	1
was	1
found,	1
would	1
be	1
no	1
difference	1
at	1
all;	1
so	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
kind	1
leave-taking,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
kind	1
interchange	1
of	1
invitations	1
and	1
promises	1
which	1
may	1
be	1
imagined,	1
they	1
parted	1
from	1
Captain	1
and	1
Mrs	1
Harville	1
at	1
their	1
own	1
door,	1
and	1
still	1
accompanied	1
by	1
Captain	1
Benwick,	1
who	1
seemed	1
to	1
cling	1
to	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
last,	1
proceeded	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
proper	1
adieus	1
to	1
the	1
Cobb.	1
Anne	1
found	1
Captain	1
Benwick	1
again	1
drawing	1
near	1
her.	1
Lord	1
Byron's	1
"dark	1
blue	1
seas"	1
could	1
not	1
fail	1
of	1
being	1
brought	1
forward	1
by	1
their	1
present	1
view,	1
and	1
she	1
gladly	1
gave	1
him	1
all	1
her	1
attention	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
attention	1
was	1
possible.	1
It	1
was	1
soon	1
drawn,	1
perforce	1
another	1
way.	1
There	1
was	1
too	1
much	1
wind	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
high	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
Cobb	1
pleasant	1
for	1
the	1
ladies,	1
and	1
they	1
agreed	1
to	1
get	1
down	1
the	1
steps	1
to	1
the	1
lower,	1
and	1
all	1
were	1
contented	1
to	1
pass	1
quietly	1
and	1
carefully	1
down	1
the	1
steep	1
flight,	1
excepting	1
Louisa;	1
she	1
must	1
be	1
jumped	1
down	1
them	1
by	1
Captain	1
Wentworth.	1
In	1
all	1
their	1
walks,	1
he	1
had	1
had	1
to	1
jump	1
her	1
from	1
the	1
stiles;	1
the	1
sensation	1
was	1
delightful	1
to	1
her.	1
The	1
hardness	1
of	1
the	1
pavement	1
for	1
her	1
feet,	1
made	1
him	1
less	1
willing	1
upon	1
the	1
present	1
occasion;	1
he	1
did	1
it,	1
however.	1
She	1
was	1
safely	1
down,	1
and	1
instantly,	1
to	1
show	1
her	1
enjoyment,	1
ran	1
up	1
the	1
steps	1
to	1
be	1
jumped	1
down	1
again.	1
He	1
advised	1
her	1
against	1
it,	1
thought	1
the	1
jar	1
too	1
great;	1
but	1
no,	1
he	1
reasoned	1
and	1
talked	1
in	1
vain,	1
she	1
smiled	1
and	1
said,	1
"I	1
am	1
determined	1
I	1
will:"	1
he	1
put	1
out	1
his	1
hands;	1
she	1
was	1
too	1
precipitate	1
by	1
half	1
a	1
second,	1
she	1
fell	1
on	1
the	1
pavement	1
on	1
the	1
Lower	1
Cobb,	1
and	1
was	1
taken	1
up	1
lifeless!	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
wound,	1
no	1
blood,	1
no	1
visible	1
bruise;	1
but	1
her	1
eyes	1
were	1
closed,	1
she	1
breathed	1
not,	1
her	1
face	1
was	1
like	1
death.	1
The	1
horror	1
of	1
the	1
moment	1
to	1
all	1
who	1
stood	1
around!	1
Captain	1
Wentworth,	1
who	1
had	1
caught	1
her	1
up,	1
knelt	1
with	1
her	1
in	1
his	1
arms,	1
looking	1
on	1
her	1
with	1
a	1
face	1
as	1
pallid	1
as	1
her	1
own,	1
in	1
an	1
agony	1
of	1
silence.	1
"She	1
is	1
dead!	1
she	1
is	1
dead!"	1
screamed	1
Mary,	1
catching	1
hold	1
of	1
her	1
husband,	1
and	1
contributing	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
horror	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
immoveable;	1
and	1
in	1
another	1
moment,	1
Henrietta,	1
sinking	1
under	1
the	1
conviction,	1
lost	1
her	1
senses	1
too,	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
fallen	1
on	1
the	1
steps,	1
but	1
for	1
Captain	1
Benwick	1
and	1
Anne,	1
who	1
caught	1
and	1
supported	1
her	1
between	1
them.	1
"Is	1
there	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
help	1
me?"	1
were	1
the	1
first	1
words	1
which	1
burst	1
from	1
Captain	1
Wentworth,	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
of	1
despair,	1
and	1
as	1
if	1
all	1
his	1
own	1
strength	1
were	1
gone.	1
"Go	1
to	1
him,	1
go	1
to	1
him,"	1
cried	1
Anne,	1
"for	1
heaven's	1
sake	1
go	1
to	1
him.	1
I	1
can	1
support	1
her	1
myself.	1
Leave	1
me,	1
and	1
go	1
to	1
him.	1
Rub	1
her	1
hands,	1
rub	1
her	1
temples;	1
here	1
are	1
salts;	1
take	1
them,	1
take	1
them."	1
Captain	1
Benwick	1
obeyed,	1
and	1
Charles	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
moment,	1
disengaging	1
himself	1
from	1
his	1
wife,	1
they	1
were	1
both	1
with	1
him;	1
and	1
Louisa	1
was	1
raised	1
up	1
and	1
supported	1
more	1
firmly	1
between	1
them,	1
and	1
everything	1
was	1
done	1
that	1
Anne	1
had	1
prompted,	1
but	1
in	1
vain;	1
while	1
Captain	1
Wentworth,	1
staggering	1
against	1
the	1
wall	1
for	1
his	1
support,	1
exclaimed	1
in	1
the	1
bitterest	1
agony--	1
"Oh	1
God!	1
her	1
father	1
and	1
mother!"	1
"A	1
surgeon!"	1
said	1
Anne.	1
He	1
caught	1
the	1
word;	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
rouse	1
him	1
at	1
once,	1
and	1
saying	1
only--	1
"True,	1
true,	1
a	1
surgeon	1
this	1
instant,"	1
was	1
darting	1
away,	1
when	1
Anne	1
eagerly	1
suggested--	1
"Captain	1
Benwick,	1
would	1
not	1
it	1
be	1
better	1
for	1
Captain	1
Benwick?	1
He	1
knows	1
where	1
a	1
surgeon	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
found."	1
Every	1
one	1
capable	1
of	1
thinking	1
felt	1
the	1
advantage	1
of	1
the	1
idea,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
moment	1
(it	1
was	1
all	1
done	1
in	1
rapid	1
moments)	1
Captain	1
Benwick	1
had	1
resigned	1
the	1
poor	1
corpse-like	1
figure	1
entirely	1
to	1
the	1
brother's	1
care,	1
and	1
was	1
off	1
for	1
the	1
town	1
with	1
the	1
utmost	1
rapidity.	1
As	1
to	1
the	1
wretched	1
party	1
left	1
behind,	1
it	1
could	1
scarcely	1
be	1
said	1
which	1
of	1
the	1
three,	1
who	1
were	1
completely	1
rational,	1
was	1
suffering	1
most:	1
Captain	1
Wentworth,	1
Anne,	1
or	1
Charles,	1
who,	1
really	1
a	1
very	1
affectionate	1
brother,	1
hung	1
over	1
Louisa	1
with	1
sobs	1
of	1
grief,	1
and	1
could	1
only	1
turn	1
his	1
eyes	1
from	1
one	1
sister,	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
other	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
as	1
insensible,	1
or	1
to	1
witness	1
the	1
hysterical	1
agitations	1
of	1
his	1
wife,	1
calling	1
on	1
him	1
for	1
help	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
give.	1
Anne,	1
attending	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
strength	1
and	1
zeal,	1
and	1
thought,	1
which	1
instinct	1
supplied,	1
to	1
Henrietta,	1
still	1
tried,	1
at	1
intervals,	1
to	1
suggest	1
comfort	1
to	1
the	1
others,	1
tried	1
to	1
quiet	1
Mary,	1
to	1
animate	1
Charles,	1
to	1
assuage	1
the	1
feelings	1
of	1
Captain	1
Wentworth.	1
Both	1
seemed	1
to	1
look	1
to	1
her	1
for	1
directions.	1
"Anne,	1
Anne,"	1
cried	1
Charles,	1
"What	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
next?	1
What,	1
in	1
heaven's	1
name,	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
next?"	1
Captain	1
Wentworth's	1
eyes	1
were	1
also	1
turned	1
towards	1
her.	1
"Had	1
not	1
she	1
better	1
be	1
carried	1
to	1
the	1
inn?	1
Yes,	1
I	1
am	1
sure:	1
carry	1
her	1
gently	1
to	1
the	1
inn."	1
"Yes,	1
yes,	1
to	1
the	1
inn,"	1
repeated	1
Captain	1
Wentworth,	1
comparatively	1
collected,	1
and	1
eager	1
to	1
be	1
doing	1
something.	1
"I	1
will	1
carry	1
her	1
myself.	1
Musgrove,	1
take	1
care	1
of	1
the	1
others."	1
By	1
this	1
time	1
the	1
report	1
of	1
the	1
accident	1
had	1
spread	1
among	1
the	1
workmen	1
and	1
boatmen	1
about	1
the	1
Cobb,	1
and	1
many	1
were	1
collected	1
near	1
them,	1
to	1
be	1
useful	1
if	1
wanted,	1
at	1
any	1
rate,	1
to	1
enjoy	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
a	1
dead	1
young	1
lady,	1
nay,	1
two	1
dead	1
young	1
ladies,	1
for	1
it	1
proved	1
twice	1
as	1
fine	1
as	1
the	1
first	1
report.	1
To	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
best-looking	1
of	1
these	1
good	1
people	1
Henrietta	1
was	1
consigned,	1
for,	1
though	1
partially	1
revived,	1
she	1
was	1
quite	1
helpless;	1
and	1
in	1
this	1
manner,	1
Anne	1
walking	1
by	1
her	1
side,	1
and	1
Charles	1
attending	1
to	1
his	1
wife,	1
they	1
set	1
forward,	1
treading	1
back	1
with	1
feelings	1
unutterable,	1
the	1
ground,	1
which	1
so	1
lately,	1
so	1
very	1
lately,	1
and	1
so	1
light	1
of	1
heart,	1
they	1
had	1
passed	1
along.	1
They	1
were	1
not	1
off	1
the	1
Cobb,	1
before	1
the	1
Harvilles	1
met	1
them.	1
Captain	1
Benwick	1
had	1
been	1
seen	1
flying	1
by	1
their	1
house,	1
with	1
a	1
countenance	1
which	1
showed	1
something	1
to	1
be	1
wrong;	1
and	1
they	1
had	1
set	1
off	1
immediately,	1
informed	1
and	1
directed	1
as	1
they	1
passed,	1
towards	1
the	1
spot.	1
Shocked	1
as	1
Captain	1
Harville	1
was,	1
he	1
brought	1
senses	1
and	1
nerves	1
that	1
could	1
be	1
instantly	1
useful;	1
and	1
a	1
look	1
between	1
him	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
decided	1
what	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
done.	1
She	1
must	1
be	1
taken	1
to	1
their	1
house;	1
all	1
must	1
go	1
to	1
their	1
house;	1
and	1
await	1
the	1
surgeon's	1
arrival	1
there.	1
They	1
would	1
not	1
listen	1
to	1
scruples:	1
he	1
was	1
obeyed;	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
beneath	1
his	1
roof;	1
and	1
while	1
Louisa,	1
under	1
Mrs	1
Harville's	1
direction,	1
was	1
conveyed	1
up	1
stairs,	1
and	1
given	1
possession	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
bed,	1
assistance,	1
cordials,	1
restoratives	1
were	1
supplied	1
by	1
her	1
husband	1
to	1
all	1
who	1
needed	1
them.	1
Louisa	1
had	1
once	1
opened	1
her	1
eyes,	1
but	1
soon	1
closed	1
them	1
again,	1
without	1
apparent	1
consciousness.	1
This	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
proof	1
of	1
life,	1
however,	1
of	1
service	1
to	1
her	1
sister;	1
and	1
Henrietta,	1
though	1
perfectly	1
incapable	1
of	1
being	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
room	1
with	1
Louisa,	1
was	1
kept,	1
by	1
the	1
agitation	1
of	1
hope	1
and	1
fear,	1
from	1
a	1
return	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
insensibility.	1
Mary,	1
too,	1
was	1
growing	1
calmer.	1
The	1
surgeon	1
was	1
with	1
them	1
almost	1
before	1
it	1
had	1
seemed	1
possible.	1
They	1
were	1
sick	1
with	1
horror,	1
while	1
he	1
examined;	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
hopeless.	1
The	1
head	1
had	1
received	1
a	1
severe	1
contusion,	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
greater	1
injuries	1
recovered	1
from:	1
he	1
was	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
hopeless;	1
he	1
spoke	1
cheerfully.	1
That	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
regard	1
it	1
as	1
a	1
desperate	1
case,	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
say	1
a	1
few	1
hours	1
must	1
end	1
it,	1
was	1
at	1
first	1
felt,	1
beyond	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
most;	1
and	1
the	1
ecstasy	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
reprieve,	1
the	1
rejoicing,	1
deep	1
and	1
silent,	1
after	1
a	1
few	1
fervent	1
ejaculations	1
of	1
gratitude	1
to	1
Heaven	1
had	1
been	1
offered,	1
may	1
be	1
conceived.	1
The	1
tone,	1
the	1
look,	1
with	1
which	1
"Thank	1
God!"	1
was	1
uttered	1
by	1
Captain	1
Wentworth,	1
Anne	1
was	1
sure	1
could	1
never	1
be	1
forgotten	1
by	1
her;	1
nor	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
him	1
afterwards,	1
as	1
he	1
sat	1
near	1
a	1
table,	1
leaning	1
over	1
it	1
with	1
folded	1
arms	1
and	1
face	1
concealed,	1
as	1
if	1
overpowered	1
by	1
the	1
various	1
feelings	1
of	1
his	1
soul,	1
and	1
trying	1
by	1
prayer	1
and	1
reflection	1
to	1
calm	1
them.	1
Louisa's	1
limbs	1
had	1
escaped.	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
injury	1
but	1
to	1
the	1
head.	1
It	1
now	1
became	1
necessary	1
for	1
the	1
party	1
to	1
consider	1
what	1
was	1
best	1
to	1
be	1
done,	1
as	1
to	1
their	1
general	1
situation.	1
They	1
were	1
now	1
able	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
each	1
other	1
and	1
consult.	1
That	1
Louisa	1
must	1
remain	1
where	1
she	1
was,	1
however	1
distressing	1
to	1
her	1
friends	1
to	1
be	1
involving	1
the	1
Harvilles	1
in	1
such	1
trouble,	1
did	1
not	1
admit	1
a	1
doubt.	1
Her	1
removal	1
was	1
impossible.	1
The	1
Harvilles	1
silenced	1
all	1
scruples;	1
and,	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
they	1
could,	1
all	1
gratitude.	1
They	1
had	1
looked	1
forward	1
and	1
arranged	1
everything	1
before	1
the	1
others	1
began	1
to	1
reflect.	1
Captain	1
Benwick	1
must	1
give	1
up	1
his	1
room	1
to	1
them,	1
and	1
get	1
another	1
bed	1
elsewhere;	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
was	1
settled.	1
They	1
were	1
only	1
concerned	1
that	1
the	1
house	1
could	1
accommodate	1
no	1
more;	1
and	1
yet	1
perhaps,	1
by	1
"putting	1
the	1
children	1
away	1
in	1
the	1
maid's	1
room,	1
or	1
swinging	1
a	1
cot	1
somewhere,"	1
they	1
could	1
hardly	1
bear	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
not	1
finding	1
room	1
for	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
besides,	1
supposing	1
they	1
might	1
wish	1
to	1
stay;	1
though,	1
with	1
regard	1
to	1
any	1
attendance	1
on	1
Miss	1
Musgrove,	1
there	1
need	1
not	1
be	1
the	1
least	1
uneasiness	1
in	1
leaving	1
her	1
to	1
Mrs	1
Harville's	1
care	1
entirely.	1
Mrs	1
Harville	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
experienced	1
nurse,	1
and	1
her	1
nursery-maid,	1
who	1
had	1
lived	1
with	1
her	1
long,	1
and	1
gone	1
about	1
with	1
her	1
everywhere,	1
was	1
just	1
such	1
another.	1
Between	1
these	1
two,	1
she	1
could	1
want	1
no	1
possible	1
attendance	1
by	1
day	1
or	1
night.	1
And	1
all	1
this	1
was	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
truth	1
and	1
sincerity	1
of	1
feeling	1
irresistible.	1
Charles,	1
Henrietta,	1
and	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
were	1
the	1
three	1
in	1
consultation,	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
little	1
while	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
an	1
interchange	1
of	1
perplexity	1
and	1
terror.	1
"Uppercross,	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
some	1
one's	1
going	1
to	1
Uppercross;	1
the	1
news	1
to	1
be	1
conveyed;	1
how	1
it	1
could	1
be	1
broken	1
to	1
Mr	1
and	1
Mrs	1
Musgrove;	1
the	1
lateness	1
of	1
the	1
morning;	1
an	1
hour	1
already	1
gone	1
since	1
they	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
off;	1
the	1
impossibility	1
of	1
being	1
in	1
tolerable	1
time."	1
At	1
first,	1
they	1
were	1
capable	1
of	1
nothing	1
more	1
to	1
the	1
purpose	1
than	1
such	1
exclamations;	1
but,	1
after	1
a	1
while,	1
Captain	1
Wentworth,	1
exerting	1
himself,	1
said--	1
"We	1
must	1
be	1
decided,	1
and	1
without	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
another	1
minute.	1
Every	1
minute	1
is	1
valuable.	1
Some	1
one	1
must	1
resolve	1
on	1
being	1
off	1
for	1
Uppercross	1
instantly.	1
Musgrove,	1
either	1
you	1
or	1
I	1
must	1
go."	1
Charles	1
agreed,	1
but	1
declared	1
his	1
resolution	1
of	1
not	1
going	1
away.	1
He	1
would	1
be	1
as	1
little	1
incumbrance	1
as	1
possible	1
to	1
Captain	1
and	1
Mrs	1
Harville;	1
but	1
as	1
to	1
leaving	1
his	1
sister	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
state,	1
he	1
neither	1
ought,	1
nor	1
would.	1
So	1
far	1
it	1
was	1
decided;	1
and	1
Henrietta	1
at	1
first	1
declared	1
the	1
same.	1
She,	1
however,	1
was	1
soon	1
persuaded	1
to	1
think	1
differently.	1
The	1
usefulness	1
of	1
her	1
staying!	1
She	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
remain	1
in	1
Louisa's	1
room,	1
or	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
her,	1
without	1
sufferings	1
which	1
made	1
her	1
worse	1
than	1
helpless!	1
She	1
was	1
forced	1
to	1
acknowledge	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
do	1
no	1
good,	1
yet	1
was	1
still	1
unwilling	1
to	1
be	1
away,	1
till,	1
touched	1
by	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
her	1
father	1
and	1
mother,	1
she	1
gave	1
it	1
up;	1
she	1
consented,	1
she	1
was	1
anxious	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
home.	1
The	1
plan	1
had	1
reached	1
this	1
point,	1
when	1
Anne,	1
coming	1
quietly	1
down	1
from	1
Louisa's	1
room,	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
hear	1
what	1
followed,	1
for	1
the	1
parlour	1
door	1
was	1
open.	1
"Then	1
it	1
is	1
settled,	1
Musgrove,"	1
cried	1
Captain	1
Wentworth,	1
"that	1
you	1
stay,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
take	1
care	1
of	1
your	1
sister	1
home.	1
But	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
rest,	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
others,	1
if	1
one	1
stays	1
to	1
assist	1
Mrs	1
Harville,	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
need	1
be	1
only	1
one.	1
Mrs	1
Charles	1
Musgrove	1
will,	1
of	1
course,	1
wish	1
to	1
get	1
back	1
to	1
her	1
children;	1
but	1
if	1
Anne	1
will	1
stay,	1
no	1
one	1
so	1
proper,	1
so	1
capable	1
as	1
Anne."	1
She	1
paused	1
a	1
moment	1
to	1
recover	1
from	1
the	1
emotion	1
of	1
hearing	1
herself	1
so	1
spoken	1
of.	1
The	1
other	1
two	1
warmly	1
agreed	1
with	1
what	1
he	1
said,	1
and	1
she	1
then	1
appeared.	1
"You	1
will	1
stay,	1
I	1
am	1
sure;	1
you	1
will	1
stay	1
and	1
nurse	1
her;"	1
cried	1
he,	1
turning	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
speaking	1
with	1
a	1
glow,	1
and	1
yet	1
a	1
gentleness,	1
which	1
seemed	1
almost	1
restoring	1
the	1
past.	1
She	1
coloured	1
deeply,	1
and	1
he	1
recollected	1
himself	1
and	1
moved	1
away.	1
She	1
expressed	1
herself	1
most	1
willing,	1
ready,	1
happy	1
to	1
remain.	1
"It	1
was	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
thinking	1
of,	1
and	1
wishing	1
to	1
be	1
allowed	1
to	1
do.	1
A	1
bed	1
on	1
the	1
floor	1
in	1
Louisa's	1
room	1
would	1
be	1
sufficient	1
for	1
her,	1
if	1
Mrs	1
Harville	1
would	1
but	1
think	1
so."	1
One	1
thing	1
more,	1
and	1
all	1
seemed	1
arranged.	1
Though	1
it	1
was	1
rather	1
desirable	1
that	1
Mr	1
and	1
Mrs	1
Musgrove	1
should	1
be	1
previously	1
alarmed	1
by	1
some	1
share	1
of	1
delay;	1
yet	1
the	1
time	1
required	1
by	1
the	1
Uppercross	1
horses	1
to	1
take	1
them	1
back,	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
dreadful	1
extension	1
of	1
suspense;	1
and	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
proposed,	1
and	1
Charles	1
Musgrove	1
agreed,	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
much	1
better	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
chaise	1
from	1
the	1
inn,	1
and	1
leave	1
Mr	1
Musgrove's	1
carriage	1
and	1
horses	1
to	1
be	1
sent	1
home	1
the	1
next	1
morning	1
early,	1
when	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
farther	1
advantage	1
of	1
sending	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
Louisa's	1
night.	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
now	1
hurried	1
off	1
to	1
get	1
everything	1
ready	1
on	1
his	1
part,	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
soon	1
followed	1
by	1
the	1
two	1
ladies.	1
When	1
the	1
plan	1
was	1
made	1
known	1
to	1
Mary,	1
however,	1
there	1
was	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
all	1
peace	1
in	1
it.	1
She	1
was	1
so	1
wretched	1
and	1
so	1
vehement,	1
complained	1
so	1
much	1
of	1
injustice	1
in	1
being	1
expected	1
to	1
go	1
away	1
instead	1
of	1
Anne;	1
Anne,	1
who	1
was	1
nothing	1
to	1
Louisa,	1
while	1
she	1
was	1
her	1
sister,	1
and	1
had	1
the	1
best	1
right	1
to	1
stay	1
in	1
Henrietta's	1
stead!	1
Why	1
was	1
not	1
she	1
to	1
be	1
as	1
useful	1
as	1
Anne?	1
And	1
to	1
go	1
home	1
without	1
Charles,	1
too,	1
without	1
her	1
husband!	1
No,	1
it	1
was	1
too	1
unkind.	1
And	1
in	1
short,	1
she	1
said	1
more	1
than	1
her	1
husband	1
could	1
long	1
withstand,	1
and	1
as	1
none	1
of	1
the	1
others	1
could	1
oppose	1
when	1
he	1
gave	1
way,	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
help	1
for	1
it;	1
the	1
change	1
of	1
Mary	1
for	1
Anne	1
was	1
inevitable.	1
Anne	1
had	1
never	1
submitted	1
more	1
reluctantly	1
to	1
the	1
jealous	1
and	1
ill-judging	1
claims	1
of	1
Mary;	1
but	1
so	1
it	1
must	1
be,	1
and	1
they	1
set	1
off	1
for	1
the	1
town,	1
Charles	1
taking	1
care	1
of	1
his	1
sister,	1
and	1
Captain	1
Benwick	1
attending	1
to	1
her.	1
She	1
gave	1
a	1
moment's	1
recollection,	1
as	1
they	1
hurried	1
along,	1
to	1
the	1
little	1
circumstances	1
which	1
the	1
same	1
spots	1
had	1
witnessed	1
earlier	1
in	1
the	1
morning.	1
There	1
she	1
had	1
listened	1
to	1
Henrietta's	1
schemes	1
for	1
Dr	1
Shirley's	1
leaving	1
Uppercross;	1
farther	1
on,	1
she	1
had	1
first	1
seen	1
Mr	1
Elliot;	1
a	1
moment	1
seemed	1
all	1
that	1
could	1
now	1
be	1
given	1
to	1
any	1
one	1
but	1
Louisa,	1
or	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
wrapt	1
up	1
in	1
her	1
welfare.	1
Captain	1
Benwick	1
was	1
most	1
considerately	1
attentive	1
to	1
her;	1
and,	1
united	1
as	1
they	1
all	1
seemed	1
by	1
the	1
distress	1
of	1
the	1
day,	1
she	1
felt	1
an	1
increasing	1
degree	1
of	1
good-will	1
towards	1
him,	1
and	1
a	1
pleasure	1
even	1
in	1
thinking	1
that	1
it	1
might,	1
perhaps,	1
be	1
the	1
occasion	1
of	1
continuing	1
their	1
acquaintance.	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
watch	1
for	1
them,	1
and	1
a	1
chaise	1
and	1
four	1
in	1
waiting,	1
stationed	1
for	1
their	1
convenience	1
in	1
the	1
lowest	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
street;	1
but	1
his	1
evident	1
surprise	1
and	1
vexation	1
at	1
the	1
substitution	1
of	1
one	1
sister	1
for	1
the	1
other,	1
the	1
change	1
in	1
his	1
countenance,	1
the	1
astonishment,	1
the	1
expressions	1
begun	1
and	1
suppressed,	1
with	1
which	1
Charles	1
was	1
listened	1
to,	1
made	1
but	1
a	1
mortifying	1
reception	1
of	1
Anne;	1
or	1
must	1
at	1
least	1
convince	1
her	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
valued	1
only	1
as	1
she	1
could	1
be	1
useful	1
to	1
Louisa.	1
She	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
be	1
composed,	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
just.	1
Without	1
emulating	1
the	1
feelings	1
of	1
an	1
Emma	1
towards	1
her	1
Henry,	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
attended	1
on	1
Louisa	1
with	1
a	1
zeal	1
above	1
the	1
common	1
claims	1
of	1
regard,	1
for	1
his	1
sake;	1
and	1
she	1
hoped	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
long	1
be	1
so	1
unjust	1
as	1
to	1
suppose	1
she	1
would	1
shrink	1
unnecessarily	1
from	1
the	1
office	1
of	1
a	1
friend.	1
In	1
the	1
mean	1
while	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
carriage.	1
He	1
had	1
handed	1
them	1
both	1
in,	1
and	1
placed	1
himself	1
between	1
them;	1
and	1
in	1
this	1
manner,	1
under	1
these	1
circumstances,	1
full	1
of	1
astonishment	1
and	1
emotion	1
to	1
Anne,	1
she	1
quitted	1
Lyme.	1
How	1
the	1
long	1
stage	1
would	1
pass;	1
how	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
affect	1
their	1
manners;	1
what	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
their	1
sort	1
of	1
intercourse,	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
foresee.	1
It	1
was	1
all	1
quite	1
natural,	1
however.	1
He	1
was	1
devoted	1
to	1
Henrietta;	1
always	1
turning	1
towards	1
her;	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
spoke	1
at	1
all,	1
always	1
with	1
the	1
view	1
of	1
supporting	1
her	1
hopes	1
and	1
raising	1
her	1
spirits.	1
In	1
general,	1
his	1
voice	1
and	1
manner	1
were	1
studiously	1
calm.	1
To	1
spare	1
Henrietta	1
from	1
agitation	1
seemed	1
the	1
governing	1
principle.	1
Once	1
only,	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
grieving	1
over	1
the	1
last	1
ill-judged,	1
ill-fated	1
walk	1
to	1
the	1
Cobb,	1
bitterly	1
lamenting	1
that	1
it	1
ever	1
had	1
been	1
thought	1
of,	1
he	1
burst	1
forth,	1
as	1
if	1
wholly	1
overcome--	1
"Don't	1
talk	1
of	1
it,	1
don't	1
talk	1
of	1
it,"	1
he	1
cried.	1
"Oh	1
God!	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
given	1
way	1
to	1
her	1
at	1
the	1
fatal	1
moment!	1
Had	1
I	1
done	1
as	1
I	1
ought!	1
But	1
so	1
eager	1
and	1
so	1
resolute!	1
Dear,	1
sweet	1
Louisa!"	1
Anne	1
wondered	1
whether	1
it	1
ever	1
occurred	1
to	1
him	1
now,	1
to	1
question	1
the	1
justness	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
previous	1
opinion	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
universal	1
felicity	1
and	1
advantage	1
of	1
firmness	1
of	1
character;	1
and	1
whether	1
it	1
might	1
not	1
strike	1
him	1
that,	1
like	1
all	1
other	1
qualities	1
of	1
the	1
mind,	1
it	1
should	1
have	1
its	1
proportions	1
and	1
limits.	1
She	1
thought	1
it	1
could	1
scarcely	1
escape	1
him	1
to	1
feel	1
that	1
a	1
persuadable	1
temper	1
might	1
sometimes	1
be	1
as	1
much	1
in	1
favour	1
of	1
happiness	1
as	1
a	1
very	1
resolute	1
character.	1
They	1
got	1
on	1
fast.	1
Anne	1
was	1
astonished	1
to	1
recognise	1
the	1
same	1
hills	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
objects	1
so	1
soon.	1
Their	1
actual	1
speed,	1
heightened	1
by	1
some	1
dread	1
of	1
the	1
conclusion,	1
made	1
the	1
road	1
appear	1
but	1
half	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
on	1
the	1
day	1
before.	1
It	1
was	1
growing	1
quite	1
dusk,	1
however,	1
before	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
neighbourhood	1
of	1
Uppercross,	1
and	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
total	1
silence	1
among	1
them	1
for	1
some	1
time,	1
Henrietta	1
leaning	1
back	1
in	1
the	1
corner,	1
with	1
a	1
shawl	1
over	1
her	1
face,	1
giving	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
her	1
having	1
cried	1
herself	1
to	1
sleep;	1
when,	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
going	1
up	1
their	1
last	1
hill,	1
Anne	1
found	1
herself	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
addressed	1
by	1
Captain	1
Wentworth.	1
In	1
a	1
low,	1
cautious	1
voice,	1
he	1
said:	1
--	1
"I	1
have	1
been	1
considering	1
what	1
we	1
had	1
best	1
do.	1
She	1
must	1
not	1
appear	1
at	1
first.	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
stand	1
it.	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
thinking	1
whether	1
you	1
had	1
not	1
better	1
remain	1
in	1
the	1
carriage	1
with	1
her,	1
while	1
I	1
go	1
in	1
and	1
break	1
it	1
to	1
Mr	1
and	1
Mrs	1
Musgrove.	1
Do	1
you	1
think	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
good	1
plan?"	1
She	1
did:	1
he	1
was	1
satisfied,	1
and	1
said	1
no	1
more.	1
But	1
the	1
remembrance	1
of	1
the	1
appeal	1
remained	1
a	1
pleasure	1
to	1
her,	1
as	1
a	1
proof	1
of	1
friendship,	1
and	1
of	1
deference	1
for	1
her	1
judgement,	1
a	1
great	1
pleasure;	1
and	1
when	1
it	1
became	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
parting	1
proof,	1
its	1
value	1
did	1
not	1
lessen.	1
When	1
the	1
distressing	1
communication	1
at	1
Uppercross	1
was	1
over,	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
the	1
father	1
and	1
mother	1
quite	1
as	1
composed	1
as	1
could	1
be	1
hoped,	1
and	1
the	1
daughter	1
all	1
the	1
better	1
for	1
being	1
with	1
them,	1
he	1
announced	1
his	1
intention	1
of	1
returning	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
carriage	1
to	1
Lyme;	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
horses	1
were	1
baited,	1
he	1
was	1
off.	1

Chapter	1
13	1
The	1
remainder	1
of	1
Anne's	1
time	1
at	1
Uppercross,	1
comprehending	1
only	1
two	1
days,	1
was	1
spent	1
entirely	1
at	1
the	1
Mansion	1
House;	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
the	1
satisfaction	1
of	1
knowing	1
herself	1
extremely	1
useful	1
there,	1
both	1
as	1
an	1
immediate	1
companion,	1
and	1
as	1
assisting	1
in	1
all	1
those	1
arrangements	1
for	1
the	1
future,	1
which,	1
in	1
Mr	1
and	1
Mrs	1
Musgrove's	1
distressed	1
state	1
of	1
spirits,	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
difficulties.	1
They	1
had	1
an	1
early	1
account	1
from	1
Lyme	1
the	1
next	1
morning.	1
Louisa	1
was	1
much	1
the	1
same.	1
No	1
symptoms	1
worse	1
than	1
before	1
had	1
appeared.	1
Charles	1
came	1
a	1
few	1
hours	1
afterwards,	1
to	1
bring	1
a	1
later	1
and	1
more	1
particular	1
account.	1
He	1
was	1
tolerably	1
cheerful.	1
A	1
speedy	1
cure	1
must	1
not	1
be	1
hoped,	1
but	1
everything	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
case	1
admitted.	1
In	1
speaking	1
of	1
the	1
Harvilles,	1
he	1
seemed	1
unable	1
to	1
satisfy	1
his	1
own	1
sense	1
of	1
their	1
kindness,	1
especially	1
of	1
Mrs	1
Harville's	1
exertions	1
as	1
a	1
nurse.	1
"She	1
really	1
left	1
nothing	1
for	1
Mary	1
to	1
do.	1
He	1
and	1
Mary	1
had	1
been	1
persuaded	1
to	1
go	1
early	1
to	1
their	1
inn	1
last	1
night.	1
Mary	1
had	1
been	1
hysterical	1
again	1
this	1
morning.	1
When	1
he	1
came	1
away,	1
she	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
walk	1
out	1
with	1
Captain	1
Benwick,	1
which,	1
he	1
hoped,	1
would	1
do	1
her	1
good.	1
He	1
almost	1
wished	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
prevailed	1
on	1
to	1
come	1
home	1
the	1
day	1
before;	1
but	1
the	1
truth	1
was,	1
that	1
Mrs	1
Harville	1
left	1
nothing	1
for	1
anybody	1
to	1
do."	1
Charles	1
was	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
Lyme	1
the	1
same	1
afternoon,	1
and	1
his	1
father	1
had	1
at	1
first	1
half	1
a	1
mind	1
to	1
go	1
with	1
him,	1
but	1
the	1
ladies	1
could	1
not	1
consent.	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
going	1
only	1
to	1
multiply	1
trouble	1
to	1
the	1
others,	1
and	1
increase	1
his	1
own	1
distress;	1
and	1
a	1
much	1
better	1
scheme	1
followed	1
and	1
was	1
acted	1
upon.	1
A	1
chaise	1
was	1
sent	1
for	1
from	1
Crewkherne,	1
and	1
Charles	1
conveyed	1
back	1
a	1
far	1
more	1
useful	1
person	1
in	1
the	1
old	1
nursery-maid	1
of	1
the	1
family,	1
one	1
who	1
having	1
brought	1
up	1
all	1
the	1
children,	1
and	1
seen	1
the	1
very	1
last,	1
the	1
lingering	1
and	1
long-petted	1
Master	1
Harry,	1
sent	1
to	1
school	1
after	1
his	1
brothers,	1
was	1
now	1
living	1
in	1
her	1
deserted	1
nursery	1
to	1
mend	1
stockings	1
and	1
dress	1
all	1
the	1
blains	1
and	1
bruises	1
she	1
could	1
get	1
near	1
her,	1
and	1
who,	1
consequently,	1
was	1
only	1
too	1
happy	1
in	1
being	1
allowed	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
help	1
nurse	1
dear	1
Miss	1
Louisa.	1
Vague	1
wishes	1
of	1
getting	1
Sarah	1
thither,	1
had	1
occurred	1
before	1
to	1
Mrs	1
Musgrove	1
and	1
Henrietta;	1
but	1
without	1
Anne,	1
it	1
would	1
hardly	1
have	1
been	1
resolved	1
on,	1
and	1
found	1
practicable	1
so	1
soon.	1
They	1
were	1
indebted,	1
the	1
next	1
day,	1
to	1
Charles	1
Hayter,	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
minute	1
knowledge	1
of	1
Louisa,	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
essential	1
to	1
obtain	1
every	1
twenty-four	1
hours.	1
He	1
made	1
it	1
his	1
business	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
Lyme,	1
and	1
his	1
account	1
was	1
still	1
encouraging.	1
The	1
intervals	1
of	1
sense	1
and	1
consciousness	1
were	1
believed	1
to	1
be	1
stronger.	1
Every	1
report	1
agreed	1
in	1
Captain	1
Wentworth's	1
appearing	1
fixed	1
in	1
Lyme.	1
Anne	1
was	1
to	1
leave	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
morrow,	1
an	1
event	1
which	1
they	1
all	1
dreaded.	1
"What	1
should	1
they	1
do	1
without	1
her?	1
They	1
were	1
wretched	1
comforters	1
for	1
one	1
another."	1
And	1
so	1
much	1
was	1
said	1
in	1
this	1
way,	1
that	1
Anne	1
thought	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
do	1
better	1
than	1
impart	1
among	1
them	1
the	1
general	1
inclination	1
to	1
which	1
she	1
was	1
privy,	1
and	1
persuaded	1
them	1
all	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
Lyme	1
at	1
once.	1
She	1
had	1
little	1
difficulty;	1
it	1
was	1
soon	1
determined	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
go;	1
go	1
to-morrow,	1
fix	1
themselves	1
at	1
the	1
inn,	1
or	1
get	1
into	1
lodgings,	1
as	1
it	1
suited,	1
and	1
there	1
remain	1
till	1
dear	1
Louisa	1
could	1
be	1
moved.	1
They	1
must	1
be	1
taking	1
off	1
some	1
trouble	1
from	1
the	1
good	1
people	1
she	1
was	1
with;	1
they	1
might	1
at	1
least	1
relieve	1
Mrs	1
Harville	1
from	1
the	1
care	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
children;	1
and	1
in	1
short,	1
they	1
were	1
so	1
happy	1
in	1
the	1
decision,	1
that	1
Anne	1
was	1
delighted	1
with	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
done,	1
and	1
felt	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
spend	1
her	1
last	1
morning	1
at	1
Uppercross	1
better	1
than	1
in	1
assisting	1
their	1
preparations,	1
and	1
sending	1
them	1
off	1
at	1
an	1
early	1
hour,	1
though	1
her	1
being	1
left	1
to	1
the	1
solitary	1
range	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
was	1
the	1
consequence.	1
She	1
was	1
the	1
last,	1
excepting	1
the	1
little	1
boys	1
at	1
the	1
cottage,	1
she	1
was	1
the	1
very	1
last,	1
the	1
only	1
remaining	1
one	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
filled	1
and	1
animated	1
both	1
houses,	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
given	1
Uppercross	1
its	1
cheerful	1
character.	1
A	1
few	1
days	1
had	1
made	1
a	1
change	1
indeed!	1
If	1
Louisa	1
recovered,	1
it	1
would	1
all	1
be	1
well	1
again.	1
More	1
than	1
former	1
happiness	1
would	1
be	1
restored.	1
There	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
a	1
doubt,	1
to	1
her	1
mind	1
there	1
was	1
none,	1
of	1
what	1
would	1
follow	1
her	1
recovery.	1
A	1
few	1
months	1
hence,	1
and	1
the	1
room	1
now	1
so	1
deserted,	1
occupied	1
but	1
by	1
her	1
silent,	1
pensive	1
self,	1
might	1
be	1
filled	1
again	1
with	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
happy	1
and	1
gay,	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
glowing	1
and	1
bright	1
in	1
prosperous	1
love,	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
most	1
unlike	1
Anne	1
Elliot!	1
An	1
hour's	1
complete	1
leisure	1
for	1
such	1
reflections	1
as	1
these,	1
on	1
a	1
dark	1
November	1
day,	1
a	1
small	1
thick	1
rain	1
almost	1
blotting	1
out	1
the	1
very	1
few	1
objects	1
ever	1
to	1
be	1
discerned	1
from	1
the	1
windows,	1
was	1
enough	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
Lady	1
Russell's	1
carriage	1
exceedingly	1
welcome;	1
and	1
yet,	1
though	1
desirous	1
to	1
be	1
gone,	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
quit	1
the	1
Mansion	1
House,	1
or	1
look	1
an	1
adieu	1
to	1
the	1
Cottage,	1
with	1
its	1
black,	1
dripping	1
and	1
comfortless	1
veranda,	1
or	1
even	1
notice	1
through	1
the	1
misty	1
glasses	1
the	1
last	1
humble	1
tenements	1
of	1
the	1
village,	1
without	1
a	1
saddened	1
heart.	1
Scenes	1
had	1
passed	1
in	1
Uppercross	1
which	1
made	1
it	1
precious.	1
It	1
stood	1
the	1
record	1
of	1
many	1
sensations	1
of	1
pain,	1
once	1
severe,	1
but	1
now	1
softened;	1
and	1
of	1
some	1
instances	1
of	1
relenting	1
feeling,	1
some	1
breathings	1
of	1
friendship	1
and	1
reconciliation,	1
which	1
could	1
never	1
be	1
looked	1
for	1
again,	1
and	1
which	1
could	1
never	1
cease	1
to	1
be	1
dear.	1
She	1
left	1
it	1
all	1
behind	1
her,	1
all	1
but	1
the	1
recollection	1
that	1
such	1
things	1
had	1
been.	1
Anne	1
had	1
never	1
entered	1
Kellynch	1
since	1
her	1
quitting	1
Lady	1
Russell's	1
house	1
in	1
September.	1
It	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
necessary,	1
and	1
the	1
few	1
occasions	1
of	1
its	1
being	1
possible	1
for	1
her	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
Hall	1
she	1
had	1
contrived	1
to	1
evade	1
and	1
escape	1
from.	1
Her	1
first	1
return	1
was	1
to	1
resume	1
her	1
place	1
in	1
the	1
modern	1
and	1
elegant	1
apartments	1
of	1
the	1
Lodge,	1
and	1
to	1
gladden	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
its	1
mistress.	1
There	1
was	1
some	1
anxiety	1
mixed	1
with	1
Lady	1
Russell's	1
joy	1
in	1
meeting	1
her.	1
She	1
knew	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
frequenting	1
Uppercross.	1
But	1
happily,	1
either	1
Anne	1
was	1
improved	1
in	1
plumpness	1
and	1
looks,	1
or	1
Lady	1
Russell	1
fancied	1
her	1
so;	1
and	1
Anne,	1
in	1
receiving	1
her	1
compliments	1
on	1
the	1
occasion,	1
had	1
the	1
amusement	1
of	1
connecting	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
silent	1
admiration	1
of	1
her	1
cousin,	1
and	1
of	1
hoping	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
blessed	1
with	1
a	1
second	1
spring	1
of	1
youth	1
and	1
beauty.	1
When	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
converse,	1
she	1
was	1
soon	1
sensible	1
of	1
some	1
mental	1
change.	1
The	1
subjects	1
of	1
which	1
her	1
heart	1
had	1
been	1
full	1
on	1
leaving	1
Kellynch,	1
and	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
felt	1
slighted,	1
and	1
been	1
compelled	1
to	1
smother	1
among	1
the	1
Musgroves,	1
were	1
now	1
become	1
but	1
of	1
secondary	1
interest.	1
She	1
had	1
lately	1
lost	1
sight	1
even	1
of	1
her	1
father	1
and	1
sister	1
and	1
Bath.	1
Their	1
concerns	1
had	1
been	1
sunk	1
under	1
those	1
of	1
Uppercross;	1
and	1
when	1
Lady	1
Russell	1
reverted	1
to	1
their	1
former	1
hopes	1
and	1
fears,	1
and	1
spoke	1
her	1
satisfaction	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
in	1
Camden	1
Place,	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
taken,	1
and	1
her	1
regret	1
that	1
Mrs	1
Clay	1
should	1
still	1
be	1
with	1
them,	1
Anne	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
ashamed	1
to	1
have	1
it	1
known	1
how	1
much	1
more	1
she	1
was	1
thinking	1
of	1
Lyme	1
and	1
Louisa	1
Musgrove,	1
and	1
all	1
her	1
acquaintance	1
there;	1
how	1
much	1
more	1
interesting	1
to	1
her	1
was	1
the	1
home	1
and	1
the	1
friendship	1
of	1
the	1
Harvilles	1
and	1
Captain	1
Benwick,	1
than	1
her	1
own	1
father's	1
house	1
in	1
Camden	1
Place,	1
or	1
her	1
own	1
sister's	1
intimacy	1
with	1
Mrs	1
Clay.	1
She	1
was	1
actually	1
forced	1
to	1
exert	1
herself	1
to	1
meet	1
Lady	1
Russell	1
with	1
anything	1
like	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
equal	1
solicitude,	1
on	1
topics	1
which	1
had	1
by	1
nature	1
the	1
first	1
claim	1
on	1
her.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
awkwardness	1
at	1
first	1
in	1
their	1
discourse	1
on	1
another	1
subject.	1
They	1
must	1
speak	1
of	1
the	1
accident	1
at	1
Lyme.	1
Lady	1
Russell	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
arrived	1
five	1
minutes	1
the	1
day	1
before,	1
when	1
a	1
full	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
had	1
burst	1
on	1
her;	1
but	1
still	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
talked	1
of,	1
she	1
must	1
make	1
enquiries,	1
she	1
must	1
regret	1
the	1
imprudence,	1
lament	1
the	1
result,	1
and	1
Captain	1
Wentworth's	1
name	1
must	1
be	1
mentioned	1
by	1
both.	1
Anne	1
was	1
conscious	1
of	1
not	1
doing	1
it	1
so	1
well	1
as	1
Lady	1
Russell.	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
speak	1
the	1
name,	1
and	1
look	1
straight	1
forward	1
to	1
Lady	1
Russell's	1
eye,	1
till	1
she	1
had	1
adopted	1
the	1
expedient	1
of	1
telling	1
her	1
briefly	1
what	1
she	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
attachment	1
between	1
him	1
and	1
Louisa.	1
When	1
this	1
was	1
told,	1
his	1
name	1
distressed	1
her	1
no	1
longer.	1
Lady	1
Russell	1
had	1
only	1
to	1
listen	1
composedly,	1
and	1
wish	1
them	1
happy,	1
but	1
internally	1
her	1
heart	1
revelled	1
in	1
angry	1
pleasure,	1
in	1
pleased	1
contempt,	1
that	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
at	1
twenty-three	1
had	1
seemed	1
to	1
understand	1
somewhat	1
of	1
the	1
value	1
of	1
an	1
Anne	1
Elliot,	1
should,	1
eight	1
years	1
afterwards,	1
be	1
charmed	1
by	1
a	1
Louisa	1
Musgrove.	1
The	1
first	1
three	1
or	1
four	1
days	1
passed	1
most	1
quietly,	1
with	1
no	1
circumstance	1
to	1
mark	1
them	1
excepting	1
the	1
receipt	1
of	1
a	1
note	1
or	1
two	1
from	1
Lyme,	1
which	1
found	1
their	1
way	1
to	1
Anne,	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
tell	1
how,	1
and	1
brought	1
a	1
rather	1
improving	1
account	1
of	1
Louisa.	1
At	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
that	1
period,	1
Lady	1
Russell's	1
politeness	1
could	1
repose	1
no	1
longer,	1
and	1
the	1
fainter	1
self-threatenings	1
of	1
the	1
past	1
became	1
in	1
a	1
decided	1
tone,	1
"I	1
must	1
call	1
on	1
Mrs	1
Croft;	1
I	1
really	1
must	1
call	1
upon	1
her	1
soon.	1
Anne,	1
have	1
you	1
courage	1
to	1
go	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
pay	1
a	1
visit	1
in	1
that	1
house?	1
It	1
will	1
be	1
some	1
trial	1
to	1
us	1
both."	1
Anne	1
did	1
not	1
shrink	1
from	1
it;	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
she	1
truly	1
felt	1
as	1
she	1
said,	1
in	1
observing--	1
"I	1
think	1
you	1
are	1
very	1
likely	1
to	1
suffer	1
the	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
two;	1
your	1
feelings	1
are	1
less	1
reconciled	1
to	1
the	1
change	1
than	1
mine.	1
By	1
remaining	1
in	1
the	1
neighbourhood,	1
I	1
am	1
become	1
inured	1
to	1
it."	1
She	1
could	1
have	1
said	1
more	1
on	1
the	1
subject;	1
for	1
she	1
had	1
in	1
fact	1
so	1
high	1
an	1
opinion	1
of	1
the	1
Crofts,	1
and	1
considered	1
her	1
father	1
so	1
very	1
fortunate	1
in	1
his	1
tenants,	1
felt	1
the	1
parish	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
sure	1
of	1
a	1
good	1
example,	1
and	1
the	1
poor	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
attention	1
and	1
relief,	1
that	1
however	1
sorry	1
and	1
ashamed	1
for	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
the	1
removal,	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
in	1
conscience	1
feel	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
gone	1
who	1
deserved	1
not	1
to	1
stay,	1
and	1
that	1
Kellynch	1
Hall	1
had	1
passed	1
into	1
better	1
hands	1
than	1
its	1
owners'.	1
These	1
convictions	1
must	1
unquestionably	1
have	1
their	1
own	1
pain,	1
and	1
severe	1
was	1
its	1
kind;	1
but	1
they	1
precluded	1
that	1
pain	1
which	1
Lady	1
Russell	1
would	1
suffer	1
in	1
entering	1
the	1
house	1
again,	1
and	1
returning	1
through	1
the	1
well-known	1
apartments.	1
In	1
such	1
moments	1
Anne	1
had	1
no	1
power	1
of	1
saying	1
to	1
herself,	1
"These	1
rooms	1
ought	1
to	1
belong	1
only	1
to	1
us.	1
Oh,	1
how	1
fallen	1
in	1
their	1
destination!	1
How	1
unworthily	1
occupied!	1
An	1
ancient	1
family	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
driven	1
away!	1
Strangers	1
filling	1
their	1
place!"	1
No,	1
except	1
when	1
she	1
thought	1
of	1
her	1
mother,	1
and	1
remembered	1
where	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
used	1
to	1
sit	1
and	1
preside,	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
sigh	1
of	1
that	1
description	1
to	1
heave.	1
Mrs	1
Croft	1
always	1
met	1
her	1
with	1
a	1
kindness	1
which	1
gave	1
her	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
fancying	1
herself	1
a	1
favourite,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
present	1
occasion,	1
receiving	1
her	1
in	1
that	1
house,	1
there	1
was	1
particular	1
attention.	1
The	1
sad	1
accident	1
at	1
Lyme	1
was	1
soon	1
the	1
prevailing	1
topic,	1
and	1
on	1
comparing	1
their	1
latest	1
accounts	1
of	1
the	1
invalid,	1
it	1
appeared	1
that	1
each	1
lady	1
dated	1
her	1
intelligence	1
from	1
the	1
same	1
hour	1
of	1
yestermorn;	1
that	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
Kellynch	1
yesterday	1
(the	1
first	1
time	1
since	1
the	1
accident),	1
had	1
brought	1
Anne	1
the	1
last	1
note,	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
trace	1
the	1
exact	1
steps	1
of;	1
had	1
staid	1
a	1
few	1
hours	1
and	1
then	1
returned	1
again	1
to	1
Lyme,	1
and	1
without	1
any	1
present	1
intention	1
of	1
quitting	1
it	1
any	1
more.	1
He	1
had	1
enquired	1
after	1
her,	1
she	1
found,	1
particularly;	1
had	1
expressed	1
his	1
hope	1
of	1
Miss	1
Elliot's	1
not	1
being	1
the	1
worse	1
for	1
her	1
exertions,	1
and	1
had	1
spoken	1
of	1
those	1
exertions	1
as	1
great.	1
This	1
was	1
handsome,	1
and	1
gave	1
her	1
more	1
pleasure	1
than	1
almost	1
anything	1
else	1
could	1
have	1
done.	1
As	1
to	1
the	1
sad	1
catastrophe	1
itself,	1
it	1
could	1
be	1
canvassed	1
only	1
in	1
one	1
style	1
by	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
steady,	1
sensible	1
women,	1
whose	1
judgements	1
had	1
to	1
work	1
on	1
ascertained	1
events;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
perfectly	1
decided	1
that	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
consequence	1
of	1
much	1
thoughtlessness	1
and	1
much	1
imprudence;	1
that	1
its	1
effects	1
were	1
most	1
alarming,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
frightful	1
to	1
think,	1
how	1
long	1
Miss	1
Musgrove's	1
recovery	1
might	1
yet	1
be	1
doubtful,	1
and	1
how	1
liable	1
she	1
would	1
still	1
remain	1
to	1
suffer	1
from	1
the	1
concussion	1
hereafter!	1
The	1
Admiral	1
wound	1
it	1
up	1
summarily	1
by	1
exclaiming--	1
"Ay,	1
a	1
very	1
bad	1
business	1
indeed.	1
A	1
new	1
sort	1
of	1
way	1
this,	1
for	1
a	1
young	1
fellow	1
to	1
be	1
making	1
love,	1
by	1
breaking	1
his	1
mistress's	1
head,	1
is	1
not	1
it,	1
Miss	1
Elliot?	1
This	1
is	1
breaking	1
a	1
head	1
and	1
giving	1
a	1
plaster,	1
truly!"	1
Admiral	1
Croft's	1
manners	1
were	1
not	1
quite	1
of	1
the	1
tone	1
to	1
suit	1
Lady	1
Russell,	1
but	1
they	1
delighted	1
Anne.	1
His	1
goodness	1
of	1
heart	1
and	1
simplicity	1
of	1
character	1
were	1
irresistible.	1
"Now,	1
this	1
must	1
be	1
very	1
bad	1
for	1
you,"	1
said	1
he,	1
suddenly	1
rousing	1
from	1
a	1
little	1
reverie,	1
"to	1
be	1
coming	1
and	1
finding	1
us	1
here.	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
recollected	1
it	1
before,	1
I	1
declare,	1
but	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
very	1
bad.	1
But	1
now,	1
do	1
not	1
stand	1
upon	1
ceremony.	1
Get	1
up	1
and	1
go	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
rooms	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
if	1
you	1
like	1
it."	1
"Another	1
time,	1
Sir,	1
I	1
thank	1
you,	1
not	1
now."	1
"Well,	1
whenever	1
it	1
suits	1
you.	1
You	1
can	1
slip	1
in	1
from	1
the	1
shrubbery	1
at	1
any	1
time;	1
and	1
there	1
you	1
will	1
find	1
we	1
keep	1
our	1
umbrellas	1
hanging	1
up	1
by	1
that	1
door.	1
A	1
good	1
place	1
is	1
not	1
it?	1
But,"	1
(checking	1
himself),	1
"you	1
will	1
not	1
think	1
it	1
a	1
good	1
place,	1
for	1
yours	1
were	1
always	1
kept	1
in	1
the	1
butler's	1
room.	1
Ay,	1
so	1
it	1
always	1
is,	1
I	1
believe.	1
One	1
man's	1
ways	1
may	1
be	1
as	1
good	1
as	1
another's,	1
but	1
we	1
all	1
like	1
our	1
own	1
best.	1
And	1
so	1
you	1
must	1
judge	1
for	1
yourself,	1
whether	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
better	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
go	1
about	1
the	1
house	1
or	1
not."	1
Anne,	1
finding	1
she	1
might	1
decline	1
it,	1
did	1
so,	1
very	1
gratefully.	1
"We	1
have	1
made	1
very	1
few	1
changes	1
either,"	1
continued	1
the	1
Admiral,	1
after	1
thinking	1
a	1
moment.	1
"Very	1
few.	1
We	1
told	1
you	1
about	1
the	1
laundry-door,	1
at	1
Uppercross.	1
That	1
has	1
been	1
a	1
very	1
great	1
improvement.	1
The	1
wonder	1
was,	1
how	1
any	1
family	1
upon	1
earth	1
could	1
bear	1
with	1
the	1
inconvenience	1
of	1
its	1
opening	1
as	1
it	1
did,	1
so	1
long!	1
You	1
will	1
tell	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
what	1
we	1
have	1
done,	1
and	1
that	1
Mr	1
Shepherd	1
thinks	1
it	1
the	1
greatest	1
improvement	1
the	1
house	1
ever	1
had.	1
Indeed,	1
I	1
must	1
do	1
ourselves	1
the	1
justice	1
to	1
say,	1
that	1
the	1
few	1
alterations	1
we	1
have	1
made	1
have	1
been	1
all	1
very	1
much	1
for	1
the	1
better.	1
My	1
wife	1
should	1
have	1
the	1
credit	1
of	1
them,	1
however.	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
very	1
little	1
besides	1
sending	1
away	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
large	1
looking-glasses	1
from	1
my	1
dressing-room,	1
which	1
was	1
your	1
father's.	1
A	1
very	1
good	1
man,	1
and	1
very	1
much	1
the	1
gentleman	1
I	1
am	1
sure:	1
but	1
I	1
should	1
think,	1
Miss	1
Elliot,"	1
(looking	1
with	1
serious	1
reflection),	1
"I	1
should	1
think	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
rather	1
a	1
dressy	1
man	1
for	1
his	1
time	1
of	1
life.	1
Such	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
looking-glasses!	1
oh	1
Lord!	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
getting	1
away	1
from	1
one's	1
self.	1
So	1
I	1
got	1
Sophy	1
to	1
lend	1
me	1
a	1
hand,	1
and	1
we	1
soon	1
shifted	1
their	1
quarters;	1
and	1
now	1
I	1
am	1
quite	1
snug,	1
with	1
my	1
little	1
shaving	1
glass	1
in	1
one	1
corner,	1
and	1
another	1
great	1
thing	1
that	1
I	1
never	1
go	1
near."	1
Anne,	1
amused	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
herself,	1
was	1
rather	1
distressed	1
for	1
an	1
answer,	1
and	1
the	1
Admiral,	1
fearing	1
he	1
might	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
civil	1
enough,	1
took	1
up	1
the	1
subject	1
again,	1
to	1
say--	1
"The	1
next	1
time	1
you	1
write	1
to	1
your	1
good	1
father,	1
Miss	1
Elliot,	1
pray	1
give	1
him	1
my	1
compliments	1
and	1
Mrs	1
Croft's,	1
and	1
say	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
settled	1
here	1
quite	1
to	1
our	1
liking,	1
and	1
have	1
no	1
fault	1
at	1
all	1
to	1
find	1
with	1
the	1
place.	1
The	1
breakfast-room	1
chimney	1
smokes	1
a	1
little,	1
I	1
grant	1
you,	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
when	1
the	1
wind	1
is	1
due	1
north	1
and	1
blows	1
hard,	1
which	1
may	1
not	1
happen	1
three	1
times	1
a	1
winter.	1
And	1
take	1
it	1
altogether,	1
now	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
been	1
into	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
houses	1
hereabouts	1
and	1
can	1
judge,	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
one	1
that	1
we	1
like	1
better	1
than	1
this.	1
Pray	1
say	1
so,	1
with	1
my	1
compliments.	1
He	1
will	1
be	1
glad	1
to	1
hear	1
it."	1
Lady	1
Russell	1
and	1
Mrs	1
Croft	1
were	1
very	1
well	1
pleased	1
with	1
each	1
other:	1
but	1
the	1
acquaintance	1
which	1
this	1
visit	1
began	1
was	1
fated	1
not	1
to	1
proceed	1
far	1
at	1
present;	1
for	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
returned,	1
the	1
Crofts	1
announced	1
themselves	1
to	1
be	1
going	1
away	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
weeks,	1
to	1
visit	1
their	1
connexions	1
in	1
the	1
north	1
of	1
the	1
county,	1
and	1
probably	1
might	1
not	1
be	1
at	1
home	1
again	1
before	1
Lady	1
Russell	1
would	1
be	1
removing	1
to	1
Bath.	1
So	1
ended	1
all	1
danger	1
to	1
Anne	1
of	1
meeting	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
at	1
Kellynch	1
Hall,	1
or	1
of	1
seeing	1
him	1
in	1
company	1
with	1
her	1
friend.	1
Everything	1
was	1
safe	1
enough,	1
and	1
she	1
smiled	1
over	1
the	1
many	1
anxious	1
feelings	1
she	1
had	1
wasted	1
on	1
the	1
subject.	1
Chapter	1
14	1
Though	1
Charles	1
and	1
Mary	1
had	1
remained	1
at	1
Lyme	1
much	1
longer	1
after	1
Mr	1
and	1
Mrs	1
Musgrove's	1
going	1
than	1
Anne	1
conceived	1
they	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
at	1
all	1
wanted,	1
they	1
were	1
yet	1
the	1
first	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
home	1
again;	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
possible	1
after	1
their	1
return	1
to	1
Uppercross	1
they	1
drove	1
over	1
to	1
the	1
Lodge.	1
They	1
had	1
left	1
Louisa	1
beginning	1
to	1
sit	1
up;	1
but	1
her	1
head,	1
though	1
clear,	1
was	1
exceedingly	1
weak,	1
and	1
her	1
nerves	1
susceptible	1
to	1
the	1
highest	1
extreme	1
of	1
tenderness;	1
and	1
though	1
she	1
might	1
be	1
pronounced	1
to	1
be	1
altogether	1
doing	1
very	1
well,	1
it	1
was	1
still	1
impossible	1
to	1
say	1
when	1
she	1
might	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
bear	1
the	1
removal	1
home;	1
and	1
her	1
father	1
and	1
mother,	1
who	1
must	1
return	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
receive	1
their	1
younger	1
children	1
for	1
the	1
Christmas	1
holidays,	1
had	1
hardly	1
a	1
hope	1
of	1
being	1
allowed	1
to	1
bring	1
her	1
with	1
them.	1
They	1
had	1
been	1
all	1
in	1
lodgings	1
together.	1
Mrs	1
Musgrove	1
had	1
got	1
Mrs	1
Harville's	1
children	1
away	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
she	1
could,	1
every	1
possible	1
supply	1
from	1
Uppercross	1
had	1
been	1
furnished,	1
to	1
lighten	1
the	1
inconvenience	1
to	1
the	1
Harvilles,	1
while	1
the	1
Harvilles	1
had	1
been	1
wanting	1
them	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
dinner	1
every	1
day;	1
and	1
in	1
short,	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
only	1
a	1
struggle	1
on	1
each	1
side	1
as	1
to	1
which	1
should	1
be	1
most	1
disinterested	1
and	1
hospitable.	1
Mary	1
had	1
had	1
her	1
evils;	1
but	1
upon	1
the	1
whole,	1
as	1
was	1
evident	1
by	1
her	1
staying	1
so	1
long,	1
she	1
had	1
found	1
more	1
to	1
enjoy	1
than	1
to	1
suffer.	1
Charles	1
Hayter	1
had	1
been	1
at	1
Lyme	1
oftener	1
than	1
suited	1
her;	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
dined	1
with	1
the	1
Harvilles	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
only	1
a	1
maid-servant	1
to	1
wait,	1
and	1
at	1
first	1
Mrs	1
Harville	1
had	1
always	1
given	1
Mrs	1
Musgrove	1
precedence;	1
but	1
then,	1
she	1
had	1
received	1
so	1
very	1
handsome	1
an	1
apology	1
from	1
her	1
on	1
finding	1
out	1
whose	1
daughter	1
she	1
was,	1
and	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
much	1
going	1
on	1
every	1
day,	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
many	1
walks	1
between	1
their	1
lodgings	1
and	1
the	1
Harvilles,	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
got	1
books	1
from	1
the	1
library,	1
and	1
changed	1
them	1
so	1
often,	1
that	1
the	1
balance	1
had	1
certainly	1
been	1
much	1
in	1
favour	1
of	1
Lyme.	1
She	1
had	1
been	1
taken	1
to	1
Charmouth	1
too,	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
bathed,	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
church,	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
a	1
great	1
many	1
more	1
people	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
in	1
the	1
church	1
at	1
Lyme	1
than	1
at	1
Uppercross;	1
and	1
all	1
this,	1
joined	1
to	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
being	1
so	1
very	1
useful,	1
had	1
made	1
really	1
an	1
agreeable	1
fortnight.	1
Anne	1
enquired	1
after	1
Captain	1
Benwick,	1
Mary's	1
face	1
was	1
clouded	1
directly.	1
Charles	1
laughed.	1
"Oh!	1
Captain	1
Benwick	1
is	1
very	1
well,	1
I	1
believe,	1
but	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
odd	1
young	1
man.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
at.	1
We	1
asked	1
him	1
to	1
come	1
home	1
with	1
us	1
for	1
a	1
day	1
or	1
two:	1
Charles	1
undertook	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
some	1
shooting,	1
and	1
he	1
seemed	1
quite	1
delighted,	1
and,	1
for	1
my	1
part,	1
I	1
thought	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
settled;	1
when	1
behold!	1
on	1
Tuesday	1
night,	1
he	1
made	1
a	1
very	1
awkward	1
sort	1
of	1
excuse;	1
`he	1
never	1
shot'	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
`been	1
quite	1
misunderstood,'	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
promised	1
this	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
promised	1
that,	1
and	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
it	1
was,	1
I	1
found,	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
mean	1
to	1
come.	1
I	1
suppose	1
he	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
finding	1
it	1
dull;	1
but	1
upon	1
my	1
word	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
thought	1
we	1
were	1
lively	1
enough	1
at	1
the	1
Cottage	1
for	1
such	1
a	1
heart-broken	1
man	1
as	1
Captain	1
Benwick."	1
Charles	1
laughed	1
again	1
and	1
said,	1
"Now	1
Mary,	1
you	1
know	1
very	1
well	1
how	1
it	1
really	1
was.	1
It	1
was	1
all	1
your	1
doing,"	1
(turning	1
to	1
Anne.)	1
"He	1
fancied	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
went	1
with	1
us,	1
he	1
should	1
find	1
you	1
close	1
by:	1
he	1
fancied	1
everybody	1
to	1
be	1
living	1
in	1
Uppercross;	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
discovered	1
that	1
Lady	1
Russell	1
lived	1
three	1
miles	1
off,	1
his	1
heart	1
failed	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
courage	1
to	1
come.	1
That	1
is	1
the	1
fact,	1
upon	1
my	1
honour,	1
Mary	1
knows	1
it	1
is."	1
But	1
Mary	1
did	1
not	1
give	1
into	1
it	1
very	1
graciously,	1
whether	1
from	1
not	1
considering	1
Captain	1
Benwick	1
entitled	1
by	1
birth	1
and	1
situation	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
an	1
Elliot,	1
or	1
from	1
not	1
wanting	1
to	1
believe	1
Anne	1
a	1
greater	1
attraction	1
to	1
Uppercross	1
than	1
herself,	1
must	1
be	1
left	1
to	1
be	1
guessed.	1
Anne's	1
good-will,	1
however,	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
lessened	1
by	1
what	1
she	1
heard.	1
She	1
boldly	1
acknowledged	1
herself	1
flattered,	1
and	1
continued	1
her	1
enquiries.	1
"Oh!	1
he	1
talks	1
of	1
you,"	1
cried	1
Charles,	1
"in	1
such	1
terms--"	1
Mary	1
interrupted	1
him.	1
"I	1
declare,	1
Charles,	1
I	1
never	1
heard	1
him	1
mention	1
Anne	1
twice	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
I	1
was	1
there.	1
I	1
declare,	1
Anne,	1
he	1
never	1
talks	1
of	1
you	1
at	1
all."	1
"No,"	1
admitted	1
Charles,	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
that	1
he	1
ever	1
does,	1
in	1
a	1
general	1
way;	1
but	1
however,	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
clear	1
thing	1
that	1
he	1
admires	1
you	1
exceedingly.	1
His	1
head	1
is	1
full	1
of	1
some	1
books	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
reading	1
upon	1
your	1
recommendation,	1
and	1
he	1
wants	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
you	1
about	1
them;	1
he	1
has	1
found	1
out	1
something	1
or	1
other	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
which	1
he	1
thinks--oh!	1
I	1
cannot	1
pretend	1
to	1
remember	1
it,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
something	1
very	1
fine--I	1
overheard	1
him	1
telling	1
Henrietta	1
all	1
about	1
it;	1
and	1
then	1
`Miss	1
Elliot'	1
was	1
spoken	1
of	1
in	1
the	1
highest	1
terms!	1
Now	1
Mary,	1
I	1
declare	1
it	1
was	1
so,	1
I	1
heard	1
it	1
myself,	1
and	1
you	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
other	1
room.	1
`Elegance,	1
sweetness,	1
beauty.'	1
Oh!	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
end	1
of	1
Miss	1
Elliot's	1
charms."	1
"And	1
I	1
am	1
sure,"	1
cried	1
Mary,	1
warmly,	1
"it	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
little	1
to	1
his	1
credit,	1
if	1
he	1
did.	1
Miss	1
Harville	1
only	1
died	1
last	1
June.	1
Such	1
a	1
heart	1
is	1
very	1
little	1
worth	1
having;	1
is	1
it,	1
Lady	1
Russell?	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
you	1
will	1
agree	1
with	1
me."	1
"I	1
must	1
see	1
Captain	1
Benwick	1
before	1
I	1
decide,"	1
said	1
Lady	1
Russell,	1
smiling.	1
"And	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
very	1
likely	1
to	1
do	1
very	1
soon,	1
I	1
can	1
tell	1
you,	1
ma'am,"	1
said	1
Charles.	1
"Though	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
nerves	1
for	1
coming	1
away	1
with	1
us,	1
and	1
setting	1
off	1
again	1
afterwards	1
to	1
pay	1
a	1
formal	1
visit	1
here,	1
he	1
will	1
make	1
his	1
way	1
over	1
to	1
Kellynch	1
one	1
day	1
by	1
himself,	1
you	1
may	1
depend	1
on	1
it.	1
I	1
told	1
him	1
the	1
distance	1
and	1
the	1
road,	1
and	1
I	1
told	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
church's	1
being	1
so	1
very	1
well	1
worth	1
seeing;	1
for	1
as	1
he	1
has	1
a	1
taste	1
for	1
those	1
sort	1
of	1
things,	1
I	1
thought	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
good	1
excuse,	1
and	1
he	1
listened	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
understanding	1
and	1
soul;	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
from	1
his	1
manner	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
have	1
him	1
calling	1
here	1
soon.	1
So,	1
I	1
give	1
you	1
notice,	1
Lady	1
Russell."	1
"Any	1
acquaintance	1
of	1
Anne's	1
will	1
always	1
be	1
welcome	1
to	1
me,"	1
was	1
Lady	1
Russell's	1
kind	1
answer.	1
"Oh!	1
as	1
to	1
being	1
Anne's	1
acquaintance,"	1
said	1
Mary,	1
"I	1
think	1
he	1
is	1
rather	1
my	1
acquaintance,	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
seeing	1
him	1
every	1
day	1
this	1
last	1
fortnight."	1
"Well,	1
as	1
your	1
joint	1
acquaintance,	1
then,	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
very	1
happy	1
to	1
see	1
Captain	1
Benwick."	1
"You	1
will	1
not	1
find	1
anything	1
very	1
agreeable	1
in	1
him,	1
I	1
assure	1
you,	1
ma'am.	1
He	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
dullest	1
young	1
men	1
that	1
ever	1
lived.	1
He	1
has	1
walked	1
with	1
me,	1
sometimes,	1
from	1
one	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
sands	1
to	1
the	1
other,	1
without	1
saying	1
a	1
word.	1
He	1
is	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
a	1
well-bred	1
young	1
man.	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
like	1
him."	1
"There	1
we	1
differ,	1
Mary,"	1
said	1
Anne.	1
"I	1
think	1
Lady	1
Russell	1
would	1
like	1
him.	1
I	1
think	1
she	1
would	1
be	1
so	1
much	1
pleased	1
with	1
his	1
mind,	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
very	1
soon	1
see	1
no	1
deficiency	1
in	1
his	1
manner."	1
"So	1
do	1
I,	1
Anne,"	1
said	1
Charles.	1
"I	1
am	1
sure	1
Lady	1
Russell	1
would	1
like	1
him.	1
He	1
is	1
just	1
Lady	1
Russell's	1
sort.	1
Give	1
him	1
a	1
book,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
read	1
all	1
day	1
long."	1
"Yes,	1
that	1
he	1
will!"	1
exclaimed	1
Mary,	1
tauntingly.	1
"He	1
will	1
sit	1
poring	1
over	1
his	1
book,	1
and	1
not	1
know	1
when	1
a	1
person	1
speaks	1
to	1
him,	1
or	1
when	1
one	1
drop's	1
one's	1
scissors,	1
or	1
anything	1
that	1
happens.	1
Do	1
you	1
think	1
Lady	1
Russell	1
would	1
like	1
that?"	1
Lady	1
Russell	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
laughing.	1
"Upon	1
my	1
word,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"I	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
supposed	1
that	1
my	1
opinion	1
of	1
any	1
one	1
could	1
have	1
admitted	1
of	1
such	1
difference	1
of	1
conjecture,	1
steady	1
and	1
matter	1
of	1
fact	1
as	1
I	1
may	1
call	1
myself.	1
I	1
have	1
really	1
a	1
curiosity	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
person	1
who	1
can	1
give	1
occasion	1
to	1
such	1
directly	1
opposite	1
notions.	1
I	1
wish	1
he	1
may	1
be	1
induced	1
to	1
call	1
here.	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
does,	1
Mary,	1
you	1
may	1
depend	1
upon	1
hearing	1
my	1
opinion;	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
determined	1
not	1
to	1
judge	1
him	1
beforehand."	1
"You	1
will	1
not	1
like	1
him,	1
I	1
will	1
answer	1
for	1
it."	1
Lady	1
Russell	1
began	1
talking	1
of	1
something	1
else.	1
Mary	1
spoke	1
with	1
animation	1
of	1
their	1
meeting	1
with,	1
or	1
rather	1
missing,	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
so	1
extraordinarily.	1
"He	1
is	1
a	1
man,"	1
said	1
Lady	1
Russell,	1
"whom	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
wish	1
to	1
see.	1
His	1
declining	1
to	1
be	1
on	1
cordial	1
terms	1
with	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
his	1
family,	1
has	1
left	1
a	1
very	1
strong	1
impression	1
in	1
his	1
disfavour	1
with	1
me."	1
This	1
decision	1
checked	1
Mary's	1
eagerness,	1
and	1
stopped	1
her	1
short	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
Elliot	1
countenance.	1
With	1
regard	1
to	1
Captain	1
Wentworth,	1
though	1
Anne	1
hazarded	1
no	1
enquiries,	1
there	1
was	1
voluntary	1
communication	1
sufficient.	1
His	1
spirits	1
had	1
been	1
greatly	1
recovering	1
lately	1
as	1
might	1
be	1
expected.	1
As	1
Louisa	1
improved,	1
he	1
had	1
improved,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
now	1
quite	1
a	1
different	1
creature	1
from	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
first	1
week.	1
He	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
Louisa;	1
and	1
was	1
so	1
extremely	1
fearful	1
of	1
any	1
ill	1
consequence	1
to	1
her	1
from	1
an	1
interview,	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
press	1
for	1
it	1
at	1
all;	1
and,	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
plan	1
of	1
going	1
away	1
for	1
a	1
week	1
or	1
ten	1
days,	1
till	1
her	1
head	1
was	1
stronger.	1
He	1
had	1
talked	1
of	1
going	1
down	1
to	1
Plymouth	1
for	1
a	1
week,	1
and	1
wanted	1
to	1
persuade	1
Captain	1
Benwick	1
to	1
go	1
with	1
him;	1
but,	1
as	1
Charles	1
maintained	1
to	1
the	1
last,	1
Captain	1
Benwick	1
seemed	1
much	1
more	1
disposed	1
to	1
ride	1
over	1
to	1
Kellynch.	1
There	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
doubt	1
that	1
Lady	1
Russell	1
and	1
Anne	1
were	1
both	1
occasionally	1
thinking	1
of	1
Captain	1
Benwick,	1
from	1
this	1
time.	1
Lady	1
Russell	1
could	1
not	1
hear	1
the	1
door-bell	1
without	1
feeling	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
his	1
herald;	1
nor	1
could	1
Anne	1
return	1
from	1
any	1
stroll	1
of	1
solitary	1
indulgence	1
in	1
her	1
father's	1
grounds,	1
or	1
any	1
visit	1
of	1
charity	1
in	1
the	1
village,	1
without	1
wondering	1
whether	1
she	1
might	1
see	1
him	1
or	1
hear	1
of	1
him.	1
Captain	1
Benwick	1
came	1
not,	1
however.	1
He	1
was	1
either	1
less	1
disposed	1
for	1
it	1
than	1
Charles	1
had	1
imagined,	1
or	1
he	1
was	1
too	1
shy;	1
and	1
after	1
giving	1
him	1
a	1
week's	1
indulgence,	1
Lady	1
Russell	1
determined	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
unworthy	1
of	1
the	1
interest	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
beginning	1
to	1
excite.	1
The	1
Musgroves	1
came	1
back	1
to	1
receive	1
their	1
happy	1
boys	1
and	1
girls	1
from	1
school,	1
bringing	1
with	1
them	1
Mrs	1
Harville's	1
little	1
children,	1
to	1
improve	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
Uppercross,	1
and	1
lessen	1
that	1
of	1
Lyme.	1
Henrietta	1
remained	1
with	1
Louisa;	1
but	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
were	1
again	1
in	1
their	1
usual	1
quarters.	1
Lady	1
Russell	1
and	1
Anne	1
paid	1
their	1
compliments	1
to	1
them	1
once,	1
when	1
Anne	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
feel	1
that	1
Uppercross	1
was	1
already	1
quite	1
alive	1
again.	1
Though	1
neither	1
Henrietta,	1
nor	1
Louisa,	1
nor	1
Charles	1
Hayter,	1
nor	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
were	1
there,	1
the	1
room	1
presented	1
as	1
strong	1
a	1
contrast	1
as	1
could	1
be	1
wished	1
to	1
the	1
last	1
state	1
she	1
had	1
seen	1
it	1
in.	1
Immediately	1
surrounding	1
Mrs	1
Musgrove	1
were	1
the	1
little	1
Harvilles,	1
whom	1
she	1
was	1
sedulously	1
guarding	1
from	1
the	1
tyranny	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
children	1
from	1
the	1
Cottage,	1
expressly	1
arrived	1
to	1
amuse	1
them.	1
On	1
one	1
side	1
was	1
a	1
table	1
occupied	1
by	1
some	1
chattering	1
girls,	1
cutting	1
up	1
silk	1
and	1
gold	1
paper;	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
were	1
tressels	1
and	1
trays,	1
bending	1
under	1
the	1
weight	1
of	1
brawn	1
and	1
cold	1
pies,	1
where	1
riotous	1
boys	1
were	1
holding	1
high	1
revel;	1
the	1
whole	1
completed	1
by	1
a	1
roaring	1
Christmas	1
fire,	1
which	1
seemed	1
determined	1
to	1
be	1
heard,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
the	1
others.	1
Charles	1
and	1
Mary	1
also	1
came	1
in,	1
of	1
course,	1
during	1
their	1
visit,	1
and	1
Mr	1
Musgrove	1
made	1
a	1
point	1
of	1
paying	1
his	1
respects	1
to	1
Lady	1
Russell,	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
close	1
to	1
her	1
for	1
ten	1
minutes,	1
talking	1
with	1
a	1
very	1
raised	1
voice,	1
but	1
from	1
the	1
clamour	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
on	1
his	1
knees,	1
generally	1
in	1
vain.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
fine	1
family-piece.	1
Anne,	1
judging	1
from	1
her	1
own	1
temperament,	1
would	1
have	1
deemed	1
such	1
a	1
domestic	1
hurricane	1
a	1
bad	1
restorative	1
of	1
the	1
nerves,	1
which	1
Louisa's	1
illness	1
must	1
have	1
so	1
greatly	1
shaken.	1
But	1
Mrs	1
Musgrove,	1
who	1
got	1
Anne	1
near	1
her	1
on	1
purpose	1
to	1
thank	1
her	1
most	1
cordially,	1
again	1
and	1
again,	1
for	1
all	1
her	1
attentions	1
to	1
them,	1
concluded	1
a	1
short	1
recapitulation	1
of	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
suffered	1
herself	1
by	1
observing,	1
with	1
a	1
happy	1
glance	1
round	1
the	1
room,	1
that	1
after	1
all	1
she	1
had	1
gone	1
through,	1
nothing	1
was	1
so	1
likely	1
to	1
do	1
her	1
good	1
as	1
a	1
little	1
quiet	1
cheerfulness	1
at	1
home.	1
Louisa	1
was	1
now	1
recovering	1
apace.	1
Her	1
mother	1
could	1
even	1
think	1
of	1
her	1
being	1
able	1
to	1
join	1
their	1
party	1
at	1
home,	1
before	1
her	1
brothers	1
and	1
sisters	1
went	1
to	1
school	1
again.	1
The	1
Harvilles	1
had	1
promised	1
to	1
come	1
with	1
her	1
and	1
stay	1
at	1
Uppercross,	1
whenever	1
she	1
returned.	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
was	1
gone,	1
for	1
the	1
present,	1
to	1
see	1
his	1
brother	1
in	1
Shropshire.	1
"I	1
hope	1
I	1
shall	1
remember,	1
in	1
future,"	1
said	1
Lady	1
Russell,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
reseated	1
in	1
the	1
carriage,	1
"not	1
to	1
call	1
at	1
Uppercross	1
in	1
the	1
Christmas	1
holidays."	1
Everybody	1
has	1
their	1
taste	1
in	1
noises	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
in	1
other	1
matters;	1
and	1
sounds	1
are	1
quite	1
innoxious,	1
or	1
most	1
distressing,	1
by	1
their	1
sort	1
rather	1
than	1
their	1
quantity.	1
When	1
Lady	1
Russell	1
not	1
long	1
afterwards,	1
was	1
entering	1
Bath	1
on	1
a	1
wet	1
afternoon,	1
and	1
driving	1
through	1
the	1
long	1
course	1
of	1
streets	1
from	1
the	1
Old	1
Bridge	1
to	1
Camden	1
Place,	1
amidst	1
the	1
dash	1
of	1
other	1
carriages,	1
the	1
heavy	1
rumble	1
of	1
carts	1
and	1
drays,	1
the	1
bawling	1
of	1
newspapermen,	1
muffin-men	1
and	1
milkmen,	1
and	1
the	1
ceaseless	1
clink	1
of	1
pattens,	1
she	1
made	1
no	1
complaint.	1
No,	1
these	1
were	1
noises	1
which	1
belonged	1
to	1
the	1
winter	1
pleasures;	1
her	1
spirits	1
rose	1
under	1
their	1
influence;	1
and	1
like	1
Mrs	1
Musgrove,	1
she	1
was	1
feeling,	1
though	1
not	1
saying,	1
that	1
after	1
being	1
long	1
in	1
the	1
country,	1
nothing	1
could	1
be	1
so	1
good	1
for	1
her	1
as	1
a	1
little	1
quiet	1
cheerfulness.	1
Anne	1
did	1
not	1
share	1
these	1
feelings.	1
She	1
persisted	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
determined,	1
though	1
very	1
silent	1
disinclination	1
for	1
Bath;	1
caught	1
the	1
first	1
dim	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
extensive	1
buildings,	1
smoking	1
in	1
rain,	1
without	1
any	1
wish	1
of	1
seeing	1
them	1
better;	1
felt	1
their	1
progress	1
through	1
the	1
streets	1
to	1
be,	1
however	1
disagreeable,	1
yet	1
too	1
rapid;	1
for	1
who	1
would	1
be	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
when	1
she	1
arrived?	1
And	1
looked	1
back,	1
with	1
fond	1
regret,	1
to	1
the	1
bustles	1
of	1
Uppercross	1
and	1
the	1
seclusion	1
of	1
Kellynch.	1
Elizabeth's	1
last	1
letter	1
had	1
communicated	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
news	1
of	1
some	1
interest.	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
was	1
in	1
Bath.	1
He	1
had	1
called	1
in	1
Camden	1
Place;	1
had	1
called	1
a	1
second	1
time,	1
a	1
third;	1
had	1
been	1
pointedly	1
attentive.	1
If	1
Elizabeth	1
and	1
her	1
father	1
did	1
not	1
deceive	1
themselves,	1
had	1
been	1
taking	1
much	1
pains	1
to	1
seek	1
the	1
acquaintance,	1
and	1
proclaim	1
the	1
value	1
of	1
the	1
connection,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
formerly	1
taken	1
pains	1
to	1
shew	1
neglect.	1
This	1
was	1
very	1
wonderful	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
true;	1
and	1
Lady	1
Russell	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
very	1
agreeable	1
curiosity	1
and	1
perplexity	1
about	1
Mr	1
Elliot,	1
already	1
recanting	1
the	1
sentiment	1
she	1
had	1
so	1
lately	1
expressed	1
to	1
Mary,	1
of	1
his	1
being	1
"a	1
man	1
whom	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
wish	1
to	1
see."	1
She	1
had	1
a	1
great	1
wish	1
to	1
see	1
him.	1
If	1
he	1
really	1
sought	1
to	1
reconcile	1
himself	1
like	1
a	1
dutiful	1
branch,	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
forgiven	1
for	1
having	1
dismembered	1
himself	1
from	1
the	1
paternal	1
tree.	1
Anne	1
was	1
not	1
animated	1
to	1
an	1
equal	1
pitch	1
by	1
the	1
circumstance,	1
but	1
she	1
felt	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
rather	1
see	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
again	1
than	1
not,	1
which	1
was	1
more	1
than	1
she	1
could	1
say	1
for	1
many	1
other	1
persons	1
in	1
Bath.	1
She	1
was	1
put	1
down	1
in	1
Camden	1
Place;	1
and	1
Lady	1
Russell	1
then	1
drove	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
lodgings,	1
in	1
Rivers	1
Street.	1
Chapter	1
15	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
had	1
taken	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
house	1
in	1
Camden	1
Place,	1
a	1
lofty	1
dignified	1
situation,	1
such	1
as	1
becomes	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
consequence;	1
and	1
both	1
he	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
were	1
settled	1
there,	1
much	1
to	1
their	1
satisfaction.	1
Anne	1
entered	1
it	1
with	1
a	1
sinking	1
heart,	1
anticipating	1
an	1
imprisonment	1
of	1
many	1
months,	1
and	1
anxiously	1
saying	1
to	1
herself,	1
"Oh!	1
when	1
shall	1
I	1
leave	1
you	1
again?"	1
A	1
degree	1
of	1
unexpected	1
cordiality,	1
however,	1
in	1
the	1
welcome	1
she	1
received,	1
did	1
her	1
good.	1
Her	1
father	1
and	1
sister	1
were	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
her,	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
shewing	1
her	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
furniture,	1
and	1
met	1
her	1
with	1
kindness.	1
Her	1
making	1
a	1
fourth,	1
when	1
they	1
sat	1
down	1
to	1
dinner,	1
was	1
noticed	1
as	1
an	1
advantage.	1
Mrs	1
Clay	1
was	1
very	1
pleasant,	1
and	1
very	1
smiling,	1
but	1
her	1
courtesies	1
and	1
smiles	1
were	1
more	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
course.	1
Anne	1
had	1
always	1
felt	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
pretend	1
what	1
was	1
proper	1
on	1
her	1
arrival,	1
but	1
the	1
complaisance	1
of	1
the	1
others	1
was	1
unlooked	1
for.	1
They	1
were	1
evidently	1
in	1
excellent	1
spirits,	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
soon	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
the	1
causes.	1
They	1
had	1
no	1
inclination	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
her.	1
After	1
laying	1
out	1
for	1
some	1
compliments	1
of	1
being	1
deeply	1
regretted	1
in	1
their	1
old	1
neighbourhood,	1
which	1
Anne	1
could	1
not	1
pay,	1
they	1
had	1
only	1
a	1
few	1
faint	1
enquiries	1
to	1
make,	1
before	1
the	1
talk	1
must	1
be	1
all	1
their	1
own.	1
Uppercross	1
excited	1
no	1
interest,	1
Kellynch	1
very	1
little:	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
Bath.	1
They	1
had	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
assuring	1
her	1
that	1
Bath	1
more	1
than	1
answered	1
their	1
expectations	1
in	1
every	1
respect.	1
Their	1
house	1
was	1
undoubtedly	1
the	1
best	1
in	1
Camden	1
Place;	1
their	1
drawing-rooms	1
had	1
many	1
decided	1
advantages	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
others	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
either	1
seen	1
or	1
heard	1
of,	1
and	1
the	1
superiority	1
was	1
not	1
less	1
in	1
the	1
style	1
of	1
the	1
fitting-up,	1
or	1
the	1
taste	1
of	1
the	1
furniture.	1
Their	1
acquaintance	1
was	1
exceedingly	1
sought	1
after.	1
Everybody	1
was	1
wanting	1
to	1
visit	1
them.	1
They	1
had	1
drawn	1
back	1
from	1
many	1
introductions,	1
and	1
still	1
were	1
perpetually	1
having	1
cards	1
left	1
by	1
people	1
of	1
whom	1
they	1
knew	1
nothing.	1
Here	1
were	1
funds	1
of	1
enjoyment.	1
Could	1
Anne	1
wonder	1
that	1
her	1
father	1
and	1
sister	1
were	1
happy?	1
She	1
might	1
not	1
wonder,	1
but	1
she	1
must	1
sigh	1
that	1
her	1
father	1
should	1
feel	1
no	1
degradation	1
in	1
his	1
change,	1
should	1
see	1
nothing	1
to	1
regret	1
in	1
the	1
duties	1
and	1
dignity	1
of	1
the	1
resident	1
landholder,	1
should	1
find	1
so	1
much	1
to	1
be	1
vain	1
of	1
in	1
the	1
littlenesses	1
of	1
a	1
town;	1
and	1
she	1
must	1
sigh,	1
and	1
smile,	1
and	1
wonder	1
too,	1
as	1
Elizabeth	1
threw	1
open	1
the	1
folding-doors	1
and	1
walked	1
with	1
exultation	1
from	1
one	1
drawing-room	1
to	1
the	1
other,	1
boasting	1
of	1
their	1
space;	1
at	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
that	1
woman,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
mistress	1
of	1
Kellynch	1
Hall,	1
finding	1
extent	1
to	1
be	1
proud	1
of	1
between	1
two	1
walls,	1
perhaps	1
thirty	1
feet	1
asunder.	1
But	1
this	1
was	1
not	1
all	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
to	1
make	1
them	1
happy.	1
They	1
had	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
too.	1
Anne	1
had	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
to	1
hear	1
of	1
Mr	1
Elliot.	1
He	1
was	1
not	1
only	1
pardoned,	1
they	1
were	1
delighted	1
with	1
him.	1
He	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
Bath	1
about	1
a	1
fortnight;	1
(he	1
had	1
passed	1
through	1
Bath	1
in	1
November,	1
in	1
his	1
way	1
to	1
London,	1
when	1
the	1
intelligence	1
of	1
Sir	1
Walter's	1
being	1
settled	1
there	1
had	1
of	1
course	1
reached	1
him,	1
though	1
only	1
twenty-four	1
hours	1
in	1
the	1
place,	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
avail	1
himself	1
of	1
it;)	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
now	1
been	1
a	1
fortnight	1
in	1
Bath,	1
and	1
his	1
first	1
object	1
on	1
arriving,	1
had	1
been	1
to	1
leave	1
his	1
card	1
in	1
Camden	1
Place,	1
following	1
it	1
up	1
by	1
such	1
assiduous	1
endeavours	1
to	1
meet,	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
did	1
meet,	1
by	1
such	1
great	1
openness	1
of	1
conduct,	1
such	1
readiness	1
to	1
apologize	1
for	1
the	1
past,	1
such	1
solicitude	1
to	1
be	1
received	1
as	1
a	1
relation	1
again,	1
that	1
their	1
former	1
good	1
understanding	1
was	1
completely	1
re-established.	1
They	1
had	1
not	1
a	1
fault	1
to	1
find	1
in	1
him.	1
He	1
had	1
explained	1
away	1
all	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
neglect	1
on	1
his	1
own	1
side.	1
It	1
had	1
originated	1
in	1
misapprehension	1
entirely.	1
He	1
had	1
never	1
had	1
an	1
idea	1
of	1
throwing	1
himself	1
off;	1
he	1
had	1
feared	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
thrown	1
off,	1
but	1
knew	1
not	1
why,	1
and	1
delicacy	1
had	1
kept	1
him	1
silent.	1
Upon	1
the	1
hint	1
of	1
having	1
spoken	1
disrespectfully	1
or	1
carelessly	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
and	1
the	1
family	1
honours,	1
he	1
was	1
quite	1
indignant.	1
He,	1
who	1
had	1
ever	1
boasted	1
of	1
being	1
an	1
Elliot,	1
and	1
whose	1
feelings,	1
as	1
to	1
connection,	1
were	1
only	1
too	1
strict	1
to	1
suit	1
the	1
unfeudal	1
tone	1
of	1
the	1
present	1
day.	1
He	1
was	1
astonished,	1
indeed,	1
but	1
his	1
character	1
and	1
general	1
conduct	1
must	1
refute	1
it.	1
He	1
could	1
refer	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
to	1
all	1
who	1
knew	1
him;	1
and	1
certainly,	1
the	1
pains	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
taking	1
on	1
this,	1
the	1
first	1
opportunity	1
of	1
reconciliation,	1
to	1
be	1
restored	1
to	1
the	1
footing	1
of	1
a	1
relation	1
and	1
heir-presumptive,	1
was	1
a	1
strong	1
proof	1
of	1
his	1
opinions	1
on	1
the	1
subject.	1
The	1
circumstances	1
of	1
his	1
marriage,	1
too,	1
were	1
found	1
to	1
admit	1
of	1
much	1
extenuation.	1
This	1
was	1
an	1
article	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
entered	1
on	1
by	1
himself;	1
but	1
a	1
very	1
intimate	1
friend	1
of	1
his,	1
a	1
Colonel	1
Wallis,	1
a	1
highly	1
respectable	1
man,	1
perfectly	1
the	1
gentleman,	1
(and	1
not	1
an	1
ill-looking	1
man,	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
added),	1
who	1
was	1
living	1
in	1
very	1
good	1
style	1
in	1
Marlborough	1
Buildings,	1
and	1
had,	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
particular	1
request,	1
been	1
admitted	1
to	1
their	1
acquaintance	1
through	1
Mr	1
Elliot,	1
had	1
mentioned	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
things	1
relative	1
to	1
the	1
marriage,	1
which	1
made	1
a	1
material	1
difference	1
in	1
the	1
discredit	1
of	1
it.	1
Colonel	1
Wallis	1
had	1
known	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
long,	1
had	1
been	1
well	1
acquainted	1
also	1
with	1
his	1
wife,	1
had	1
perfectly	1
understood	1
the	1
whole	1
story.	1
She	1
was	1
certainly	1
not	1
a	1
woman	1
of	1
family,	1
but	1
well	1
educated,	1
accomplished,	1
rich,	1
and	1
excessively	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
his	1
friend.	1
There	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
charm.	1
She	1
had	1
sought	1
him.	1
Without	1
that	1
attraction,	1
not	1
all	1
her	1
money	1
would	1
have	1
tempted	1
Elliot,	1
and	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
was,	1
moreover,	1
assured	1
of	1
her	1
having	1
been	1
a	1
very	1
fine	1
woman.	1
Here	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
to	1
soften	1
the	1
business.	1
A	1
very	1
fine	1
woman	1
with	1
a	1
large	1
fortune,	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
him!	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
seemed	1
to	1
admit	1
it	1
as	1
complete	1
apology;	1
and	1
though	1
Elizabeth	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
the	1
circumstance	1
in	1
quite	1
so	1
favourable	1
a	1
light,	1
she	1
allowed	1
it	1
be	1
a	1
great	1
extenuation.	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
had	1
called	1
repeatedly,	1
had	1
dined	1
with	1
them	1
once,	1
evidently	1
delighted	1
by	1
the	1
distinction	1
of	1
being	1
asked,	1
for	1
they	1
gave	1
no	1
dinners	1
in	1
general;	1
delighted,	1
in	1
short,	1
by	1
every	1
proof	1
of	1
cousinly	1
notice,	1
and	1
placing	1
his	1
whole	1
happiness	1
in	1
being	1
on	1
intimate	1
terms	1
in	1
Camden	1
Place.	1
Anne	1
listened,	1
but	1
without	1
quite	1
understanding	1
it.	1
Allowances,	1
large	1
allowances,	1
she	1
knew,	1
must	1
be	1
made	1
for	1
the	1
ideas	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
spoke.	1
She	1
heard	1
it	1
all	1
under	1
embellishment.	1
All	1
that	1
sounded	1
extravagant	1
or	1
irrational	1
in	1
the	1
progress	1
of	1
the	1
reconciliation	1
might	1
have	1
no	1
origin	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
language	1
of	1
the	1
relators.	1
Still,	1
however,	1
she	1
had	1
the	1
sensation	1
of	1
there	1
being	1
something	1
more	1
than	1
immediately	1
appeared,	1
in	1
Mr	1
Elliot's	1
wishing,	1
after	1
an	1
interval	1
of	1
so	1
many	1
years,	1
to	1
be	1
well	1
received	1
by	1
them.	1
In	1
a	1
worldly	1
view,	1
he	1
had	1
nothing	1
to	1
gain	1
by	1
being	1
on	1
terms	1
with	1
Sir	1
Walter;	1
nothing	1
to	1
risk	1
by	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
variance.	1
In	1
all	1
probability	1
he	1
was	1
already	1
the	1
richer	1
of	1
the	1
two,	1
and	1
the	1
Kellynch	1
estate	1
would	1
as	1
surely	1
be	1
his	1
hereafter	1
as	1
the	1
title.	1
A	1
sensible	1
man,	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
looked	1
like	1
a	1
very	1
sensible	1
man,	1
why	1
should	1
it	1
be	1
an	1
object	1
to	1
him?	1
She	1
could	1
only	1
offer	1
one	1
solution;	1
it	1
was,	1
perhaps,	1
for	1
Elizabeth's	1
sake.	1
There	1
might	1
really	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
liking	1
formerly,	1
though	1
convenience	1
and	1
accident	1
had	1
drawn	1
him	1
a	1
different	1
way;	1
and	1
now	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
afford	1
to	1
please	1
himself,	1
he	1
might	1
mean	1
to	1
pay	1
his	1
addresses	1
to	1
her.	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
certainly	1
very	1
handsome,	1
with	1
well-bred,	1
elegant	1
manners,	1
and	1
her	1
character	1
might	1
never	1
have	1
been	1
penetrated	1
by	1
Mr	1
Elliot,	1
knowing	1
her	1
but	1
in	1
public,	1
and	1
when	1
very	1
young	1
himself.	1
How	1
her	1
temper	1
and	1
understanding	1
might	1
bear	1
the	1
investigation	1
of	1
his	1
present	1
keener	1
time	1
of	1
life	1
was	1
another	1
concern	1
and	1
rather	1
a	1
fearful	1
one.	1
Most	1
earnestly	1
did	1
she	1
wish	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
not	1
be	1
too	1
nice,	1
or	1
too	1
observant	1
if	1
Elizabeth	1
were	1
his	1
object;	1
and	1
that	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
disposed	1
to	1
believe	1
herself	1
so,	1
and	1
that	1
her	1
friend	1
Mrs	1
Clay	1
was	1
encouraging	1
the	1
idea,	1
seemed	1
apparent	1
by	1
a	1
glance	1
or	1
two	1
between	1
them,	1
while	1
Mr	1
Elliot's	1
frequent	1
visits	1
were	1
talked	1
of.	1
Anne	1
mentioned	1
the	1
glimpses	1
she	1
had	1
had	1
of	1
him	1
at	1
Lyme,	1
but	1
without	1
being	1
much	1
attended	1
to.	1
"Oh!	1
yes,	1
perhaps,	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
Mr	1
Elliot.	1
They	1
did	1
not	1
know.	1
It	1
might	1
be	1
him,	1
perhaps."	1
They	1
could	1
not	1
listen	1
to	1
her	1
description	1
of	1
him.	1
They	1
were	1
describing	1
him	1
themselves;	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
especially.	1
He	1
did	1
justice	1
to	1
his	1
very	1
gentlemanlike	1
appearance,	1
his	1
air	1
of	1
elegance	1
and	1
fashion,	1
his	1
good	1
shaped	1
face,	1
his	1
sensible	1
eye;	1
but,	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
"must	1
lament	1
his	1
being	1
very	1
much	1
under-hung,	1
a	1
defect	1
which	1
time	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
increased;	1
nor	1
could	1
he	1
pretend	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
ten	1
years	1
had	1
not	1
altered	1
almost	1
every	1
feature	1
for	1
the	1
worse.	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
appeared	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
he	1
(Sir	1
Walter)	1
was	1
looking	1
exactly	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
when	1
they	1
last	1
parted;"	1
but	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
had	1
"not	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
return	1
the	1
compliment	1
entirely,	1
which	1
had	1
embarrassed	1
him.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
mean	1
to	1
complain,	1
however.	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
was	1
better	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
than	1
most	1
men,	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
objection	1
to	1
being	1
seen	1
with	1
him	1
anywhere."	1
Mr	1
Elliot,	1
and	1
his	1
friends	1
in	1
Marlborough	1
Buildings,	1
were	1
talked	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
evening.	1
"Colonel	1
Wallis	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
impatient	1
to	1
be	1
introduced	1
to	1
them!	1
and	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
so	1
anxious	1
that	1
he	1
should!"	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
Mrs	1
Wallis,	1
at	1
present	1
known	1
only	1
to	1
them	1
by	1
description,	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
daily	1
expectation	1
of	1
her	1
confinement;	1
but	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
spoke	1
of	1
her	1
as	1
"a	1
most	1
charming	1
woman,	1
quite	1
worthy	1
of	1
being	1
known	1
in	1
Camden	1
Place,"	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
recovered	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
acquainted.	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
thought	1
much	1
of	1
Mrs	1
Wallis;	1
she	1
was	1
said	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
excessively	1
pretty	1
woman,	1
beautiful.	1
"He	1
longed	1
to	1
see	1
her.	1
He	1
hoped	1
she	1
might	1
make	1
some	1
amends	1
for	1
the	1
many	1
very	1
plain	1
faces	1
he	1
was	1
continually	1
passing	1
in	1
the	1
streets.	1
The	1
worst	1
of	1
Bath	1
was	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
its	1
plain	1
women.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
mean	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
pretty	1
women,	1
but	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
plain	1
was	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
proportion.	1
He	1
had	1
frequently	1
observed,	1
as	1
he	1
walked,	1
that	1
one	1
handsome	1
face	1
would	1
be	1
followed	1
by	1
thirty,	1
or	1
five-and-thirty	1
frights;	1
and	1
once,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
stood	1
in	1
a	1
shop	1
on	1
Bond	1
Street,	1
he	1
had	1
counted	1
eighty-seven	1
women	1
go	1
by,	1
one	1
after	1
another,	1
without	1
there	1
being	1
a	1
tolerable	1
face	1
among	1
them.	1
It	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
frosty	1
morning,	1
to	1
be	1
sure,	1
a	1
sharp	1
frost,	1
which	1
hardly	1
one	1
woman	1
in	1
a	1
thousand	1
could	1
stand	1
the	1
test	1
of.	1
But	1
still,	1
there	1
certainly	1
were	1
a	1
dreadful	1
multitude	1
of	1
ugly	1
women	1
in	1
Bath;	1
and	1
as	1
for	1
the	1
men!	1
they	1
were	1
infinitely	1
worse.	1
Such	1
scarecrows	1
as	1
the	1
streets	1
were	1
full	1
of!	1
It	1
was	1
evident	1
how	1
little	1
the	1
women	1
were	1
used	1
to	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
anything	1
tolerable,	1
by	1
the	1
effect	1
which	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
decent	1
appearance	1
produced.	1
He	1
had	1
never	1
walked	1
anywhere	1
arm-in-arm	1
with	1
Colonel	1
Wallis	1
(who	1
was	1
a	1
fine	1
military	1
figure,	1
though	1
sandy-haired)	1
without	1
observing	1
that	1
every	1
woman's	1
eye	1
was	1
upon	1
him;	1
every	1
woman's	1
eye	1
was	1
sure	1
to	1
be	1
upon	1
Colonel	1
Wallis."	1
Modest	1
Sir	1
Walter!	1
He	1
was	1
not	1
allowed	1
to	1
escape,	1
however.	1
His	1
daughter	1
and	1
Mrs	1
Clay	1
united	1
in	1
hinting	1
that	1
Colonel	1
Wallis's	1
companion	1
might	1
have	1
as	1
good	1
a	1
figure	1
as	1
Colonel	1
Wallis,	1
and	1
certainly	1
was	1
not	1
sandy-haired.	1
"How	1
is	1
Mary	1
looking?"	1
said	1
Sir	1
Walter,	1
in	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
his	1
good	1
humour.	1
"The	1
last	1
time	1
I	1
saw	1
her	1
she	1
had	1
a	1
red	1
nose,	1
but	1
I	1
hope	1
that	1
may	1
not	1
happen	1
every	1
day."	1
"Oh!	1
no,	1
that	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
quite	1
accidental.	1
In	1
general	1
she	1
has	1
been	1
in	1
very	1
good	1
health	1
and	1
very	1
good	1
looks	1
since	1
Michaelmas."	1
"If	1
I	1
thought	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
tempt	1
her	1
to	1
go	1
out	1
in	1
sharp	1
winds,	1
and	1
grow	1
coarse,	1
I	1
would	1
send	1
her	1
a	1
new	1
hat	1
and	1
pelisse."	1
Anne	1
was	1
considering	1
whether	1
she	1
should	1
venture	1
to	1
suggest	1
that	1
a	1
gown,	1
or	1
a	1
cap,	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
liable	1
to	1
any	1
such	1
misuse,	1
when	1
a	1
knock	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
suspended	1
everything.	1
"A	1
knock	1
at	1
the	1
door!	1
and	1
so	1
late!	1
It	1
was	1
ten	1
o'clock.	1
Could	1
it	1
be	1
Mr	1
Elliot?	1
They	1
knew	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
dine	1
in	1
Lansdown	1
Crescent.	1
It	1
was	1
possible	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
stop	1
in	1
his	1
way	1
home	1
to	1
ask	1
them	1
how	1
they	1
did.	1
They	1
could	1
think	1
of	1
no	1
one	1
else.	1
Mrs	1
Clay	1
decidedly	1
thought	1
it	1
Mr	1
Elliot's	1
knock."	1
Mrs	1
Clay	1
was	1
right.	1
With	1
all	1
the	1
state	1
which	1
a	1
butler	1
and	1
foot-boy	1
could	1
give,	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
was	1
ushered	1
into	1
the	1
room.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
same,	1
the	1
very	1
same	1
man,	1
with	1
no	1
difference	1
but	1
of	1
dress.	1
Anne	1
drew	1
a	1
little	1
back,	1
while	1
the	1
others	1
received	1
his	1
compliments,	1
and	1
her	1
sister	1
his	1
apologies	1
for	1
calling	1
at	1
so	1
unusual	1
an	1
hour,	1
but	1
"he	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
so	1
near	1
without	1
wishing	1
to	1
know	1
that	1
neither	1
she	1
nor	1
her	1
friend	1
had	1
taken	1
cold	1
the	1
day	1
before,"	1
&c.	1
&c;	1
which	1
was	1
all	1
as	1
politely	1
done,	1
and	1
as	1
politely	1
taken,	1
as	1
possible,	1
but	1
her	1
part	1
must	1
follow	1
then.	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
talked	1
of	1
his	1
youngest	1
daughter;	1
"Mr	1
Elliot	1
must	1
give	1
him	1
leave	1
to	1
present	1
him	1
to	1
his	1
youngest	1
daughter"	1
(there	1
was	1
no	1
occasion	1
for	1
remembering	1
Mary);	1
and	1
Anne,	1
smiling	1
and	1
blushing,	1
very	1
becomingly	1
shewed	1
to	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
the	1
pretty	1
features	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
forgotten,	1
and	1
instantly	1
saw,	1
with	1
amusement	1
at	1
his	1
little	1
start	1
of	1
surprise,	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
at	1
all	1
aware	1
of	1
who	1
she	1
was.	1
He	1
looked	1
completely	1
astonished,	1
but	1
not	1
more	1
astonished	1
than	1
pleased;	1
his	1
eyes	1
brightened!	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
most	1
perfect	1
alacrity	1
he	1
welcomed	1
the	1
relationship,	1
alluded	1
to	1
the	1
past,	1
and	1
entreated	1
to	1
be	1
received	1
as	1
an	1
acquaintance	1
already.	1
He	1
was	1
quite	1
as	1
good-looking	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
appeared	1
at	1
Lyme,	1
his	1
countenance	1
improved	1
by	1
speaking,	1
and	1
his	1
manners	1
were	1
so	1
exactly	1
what	1
they	1
ought	1
to	1
be,	1
so	1
polished,	1
so	1
easy,	1
so	1
particularly	1
agreeable,	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
compare	1
them	1
in	1
excellence	1
to	1
only	1
one	1
person's	1
manners.	1
They	1
were	1
not	1
the	1
same,	1
but	1
they	1
were,	1
perhaps,	1
equally	1
good.	1
He	1
sat	1
down	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
improved	1
their	1
conversation	1
very	1
much.	1
There	1
could	1
be	1
no	1
doubt	1
of	1
his	1
being	1
a	1
sensible	1
man.	1
Ten	1
minutes	1
were	1
enough	1
to	1
certify	1
that.	1
His	1
tone,	1
his	1
expressions,	1
his	1
choice	1
of	1
subject,	1
his	1
knowing	1
where	1
to	1
stop;	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
the	1
operation	1
of	1
a	1
sensible,	1
discerning	1
mind.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
could,	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
her	1
of	1
Lyme,	1
wanting	1
to	1
compare	1
opinions	1
respecting	1
the	1
place,	1
but	1
especially	1
wanting	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
the	1
circumstance	1
of	1
their	1
happening	1
to	1
be	1
guests	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
inn	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time;	1
to	1
give	1
his	1
own	1
route,	1
understand	1
something	1
of	1
hers,	1
and	1
regret	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
have	1
lost	1
such	1
an	1
opportunity	1
of	1
paying	1
his	1
respects	1
to	1
her.	1
She	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
short	1
account	1
of	1
her	1
party	1
and	1
business	1
at	1
Lyme.	1
His	1
regret	1
increased	1
as	1
he	1
listened.	1
He	1
had	1
spent	1
his	1
whole	1
solitary	1
evening	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
adjoining	1
theirs;	1
had	1
heard	1
voices,	1
mirth	1
continually;	1
thought	1
they	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
most	1
delightful	1
set	1
of	1
people,	1
longed	1
to	1
be	1
with	1
them,	1
but	1
certainly	1
without	1
the	1
smallest	1
suspicion	1
of	1
his	1
possessing	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
a	1
right	1
to	1
introduce	1
himself.	1
If	1
he	1
had	1
but	1
asked	1
who	1
the	1
party	1
were!	1
The	1
name	1
of	1
Musgrove	1
would	1
have	1
told	1
him	1
enough.	1
"Well,	1
it	1
would	1
serve	1
to	1
cure	1
him	1
of	1
an	1
absurd	1
practice	1
of	1
never	1
asking	1
a	1
question	1
at	1
an	1
inn,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
adopted,	1
when	1
quite	1
a	1
young	1
man,	1
on	1
the	1
principal	1
of	1
its	1
being	1
very	1
ungenteel	1
to	1
be	1
curious.	1
"The	1
notions	1
of	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
of	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
and	1
twenty,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"as	1
to	1
what	1
is	1
necessary	1
in	1
manners	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
quite	1
the	1
thing,	1
are	1
more	1
absurd,	1
I	1
believe,	1
than	1
those	1
of	1
any	1
other	1
set	1
of	1
beings	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
The	1
folly	1
of	1
the	1
means	1
they	1
often	1
employ	1
is	1
only	1
to	1
be	1
equalled	1
by	1
the	1
folly	1
of	1
what	1
they	1
have	1
in	1
view."	1
But	1
he	1
must	1
not	1
be	1
addressing	1
his	1
reflections	1
to	1
Anne	1
alone:	1
he	1
knew	1
it;	1
he	1
was	1
soon	1
diffused	1
again	1
among	1
the	1
others,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
at	1
intervals	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
return	1
to	1
Lyme.	1
His	1
enquiries,	1
however,	1
produced	1
at	1
length	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
scene	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
engaged	1
in	1
there,	1
soon	1
after	1
his	1
leaving	1
the	1
place.	1
Having	1
alluded	1
to	1
"an	1
accident,"	1
he	1
must	1
hear	1
the	1
whole.	1
When	1
he	1
questioned,	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
began	1
to	1
question	1
also,	1
but	1
the	1
difference	1
in	1
their	1
manner	1
of	1
doing	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
unfelt.	1
She	1
could	1
only	1
compare	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
to	1
Lady	1
Russell,	1
in	1
the	1
wish	1
of	1
really	1
comprehending	1
what	1
had	1
passed,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
degree	1
of	1
concern	1
for	1
what	1
she	1
must	1
have	1
suffered	1
in	1
witnessing	1
it.	1
He	1
staid	1
an	1
hour	1
with	1
them.	1
The	1
elegant	1
little	1
clock	1
on	1
the	1
mantel-	1
piece	1
had	1
struck	1
"eleven	1
with	1
its	1
silver	1
sounds,"	1
and	1
the	1
watchman	1
was	1
beginning	1
to	1
be	1
heard	1
at	1
a	1
distance	1
telling	1
the	1
same	1
tale,	1
before	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
or	1
any	1
of	1
them	1
seemed	1
to	1
feel	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
there	1
long.	1
Anne	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
supposed	1
it	1
possible	1
that	1
her	1
first	1
evening	1
in	1
Camden	1
Place	1
could	1
have	1
passed	1
so	1
well!	1
Chapter	1
16	1
There	1
was	1
one	1
point	1
which	1
Anne,	1
on	1
returning	1
to	1
her	1
family,	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
more	1
thankful	1
to	1
ascertain	1
even	1
than	1
Mr	1
Elliot's	1
being	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
Elizabeth,	1
which	1
was,	1
her	1
father's	1
not	1
being	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
Mrs	1
Clay;	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
very	1
far	1
from	1
easy	1
about	1
it,	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
at	1
home	1
a	1
few	1
hours.	1
On	1
going	1
down	1
to	1
breakfast	1
the	1
next	1
morning,	1
she	1
found	1
there	1
had	1
just	1
been	1
a	1
decent	1
pretence	1
on	1
the	1
lady's	1
side	1
of	1
meaning	1
to	1
leave	1
them.	1
She	1
could	1
imagine	1
Mrs	1
Clay	1
to	1
have	1
said,	1
that	1
"now	1
Miss	1
Anne	1
was	1
come,	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
suppose	1
herself	1
at	1
all	1
wanted;"	1
for	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
replying	1
in	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
whisper,	1
"That	1
must	1
not	1
be	1
any	1
reason,	1
indeed.	1
I	1
assure	1
you	1
I	1
feel	1
it	1
none.	1
She	1
is	1
nothing	1
to	1
me,	1
compared	1
with	1
you;"	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
full	1
time	1
to	1
hear	1
her	1
father	1
say,	1
"My	1
dear	1
madam,	1
this	1
must	1
not	1
be.	1
As	1
yet,	1
you	1
have	1
seen	1
nothing	1
of	1
Bath.	1
You	1
have	1
been	1
here	1
only	1
to	1
be	1
useful.	1
You	1
must	1
not	1
run	1
away	1
from	1
us	1
now.	1
You	1
must	1
stay	1
to	1
be	1
acquainted	1
with	1
Mrs	1
Wallis,	1
the	1
beautiful	1
Mrs	1
Wallis.	1
To	1
your	1
fine	1
mind,	1
I	1
well	1
know	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
beauty	1
is	1
a	1
real	1
gratification."	1
He	1
spoke	1
and	1
looked	1
so	1
much	1
in	1
earnest,	1
that	1
Anne	1
was	1
not	1
surprised	1
to	1
see	1
Mrs	1
Clay	1
stealing	1
a	1
glance	1
at	1
Elizabeth	1
and	1
herself.	1
Her	1
countenance,	1
perhaps,	1
might	1
express	1
some	1
watchfulness;	1
but	1
the	1
praise	1
of	1
the	1
fine	1
mind	1
did	1
not	1
appear	1
to	1
excite	1
a	1
thought	1
in	1
her	1
sister.	1
The	1
lady	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
yield	1
to	1
such	1
joint	1
entreaties,	1
and	1
promise	1
to	1
stay.	1
In	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
morning,	1
Anne	1
and	1
her	1
father	1
chancing	1
to	1
be	1
alone	1
together,	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
compliment	1
her	1
on	1
her	1
improved	1
looks;	1
he	1
thought	1
her	1
"less	1
thin	1
in	1
her	1
person,	1
in	1
her	1
cheeks;	1
her	1
skin,	1
her	1
complexion,	1
greatly	1
improved;	1
clearer,	1
fresher.	1
Had	1
she	1
been	1
using	1
any	1
thing	1
in	1
particular?"	1
"No,	1
nothing."	1
"Merely	1
Gowland,"	1
he	1
supposed.	1
"No,	1
nothing	1
at	1
all."	1
"Ha!	1
he	1
was	1
surprised	1
at	1
that;"	1
and	1
added,	1
"certainly	1
you	1
cannot	1
do	1
better	1
than	1
to	1
continue	1
as	1
you	1
are;	1
you	1
cannot	1
be	1
better	1
than	1
well;	1
or	1
I	1
should	1
recommend	1
Gowland,	1
the	1
constant	1
use	1
of	1
Gowland,	1
during	1
the	1
spring	1
months.	1
Mrs	1
Clay	1
has	1
been	1
using	1
it	1
at	1
my	1
recommendation,	1
and	1
you	1
see	1
what	1
it	1
has	1
done	1
for	1
her.	1
You	1
see	1
how	1
it	1
has	1
carried	1
away	1
her	1
freckles."	1
If	1
Elizabeth	1
could	1
but	1
have	1
heard	1
this!	1
Such	1
personal	1
praise	1
might	1
have	1
struck	1
her,	1
especially	1
as	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
appear	1
to	1
Anne	1
that	1
the	1
freckles	1
were	1
at	1
all	1
lessened.	1
But	1
everything	1
must	1
take	1
its	1
chance.	1
The	1
evil	1
of	1
a	1
marriage	1
would	1
be	1
much	1
diminished,	1
if	1
Elizabeth	1
were	1
also	1
to	1
marry.	1
As	1
for	1
herself,	1
she	1
might	1
always	1
command	1
a	1
home	1
with	1
Lady	1
Russell.	1
Lady	1
Russell's	1
composed	1
mind	1
and	1
polite	1
manners	1
were	1
put	1
to	1
some	1
trial	1
on	1
this	1
point,	1
in	1
her	1
intercourse	1
in	1
Camden	1
Place.	1
The	1
sight	1
of	1
Mrs	1
Clay	1
in	1
such	1
favour,	1
and	1
of	1
Anne	1
so	1
overlooked,	1
was	1
a	1
perpetual	1
provocation	1
to	1
her	1
there;	1
and	1
vexed	1
her	1
as	1
much	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
away,	1
as	1
a	1
person	1
in	1
Bath	1
who	1
drinks	1
the	1
water,	1
gets	1
all	1
the	1
new	1
publications,	1
and	1
has	1
a	1
very	1
large	1
acquaintance,	1
has	1
time	1
to	1
be	1
vexed.	1
As	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
became	1
known	1
to	1
her,	1
she	1
grew	1
more	1
charitable,	1
or	1
more	1
indifferent,	1
towards	1
the	1
others.	1
His	1
manners	1
were	1
an	1
immediate	1
recommendation;	1
and	1
on	1
conversing	1
with	1
him	1
she	1
found	1
the	1
solid	1
so	1
fully	1
supporting	1
the	1
superficial,	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
at	1
first,	1
as	1
she	1
told	1
Anne,	1
almost	1
ready	1
to	1
exclaim,	1
"Can	1
this	1
be	1
Mr	1
Elliot?"	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
seriously	1
picture	1
to	1
herself	1
a	1
more	1
agreeable	1
or	1
estimable	1
man.	1
Everything	1
united	1
in	1
him;	1
good	1
understanding,	1
correct	1
opinions,	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
a	1
warm	1
heart.	1
He	1
had	1
strong	1
feelings	1
of	1
family	1
attachment	1
and	1
family	1
honour,	1
without	1
pride	1
or	1
weakness;	1
he	1
lived	1
with	1
the	1
liberality	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
fortune,	1
without	1
display;	1
he	1
judged	1
for	1
himself	1
in	1
everything	1
essential,	1
without	1
defying	1
public	1
opinion	1
in	1
any	1
point	1
of	1
worldly	1
decorum.	1
He	1
was	1
steady,	1
observant,	1
moderate,	1
candid;	1
never	1
run	1
away	1
with	1
by	1
spirits	1
or	1
by	1
selfishness,	1
which	1
fancied	1
itself	1
strong	1
feeling;	1
and	1
yet,	1
with	1
a	1
sensibility	1
to	1
what	1
was	1
amiable	1
and	1
lovely,	1
and	1
a	1
value	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
felicities	1
of	1
domestic	1
life,	1
which	1
characters	1
of	1
fancied	1
enthusiasm	1
and	1
violent	1
agitation	1
seldom	1
really	1
possess.	1
She	1
was	1
sure	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
happy	1
in	1
marriage.	1
Colonel	1
Wallis	1
said	1
it,	1
and	1
Lady	1
Russell	1
saw	1
it;	1
but	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
no	1
unhappiness	1
to	1
sour	1
his	1
mind,	1
nor	1
(she	1
began	1
pretty	1
soon	1
to	1
suspect)	1
to	1
prevent	1
his	1
thinking	1
of	1
a	1
second	1
choice.	1
Her	1
satisfaction	1
in	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
outweighed	1
all	1
the	1
plague	1
of	1
Mrs	1
Clay.	1
It	1
was	1
now	1
some	1
years	1
since	1
Anne	1
had	1
begun	1
to	1
learn	1
that	1
she	1
and	1
her	1
excellent	1
friend	1
could	1
sometimes	1
think	1
differently;	1
and	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
surprise	1
her,	1
therefore,	1
that	1
Lady	1
Russell	1
should	1
see	1
nothing	1
suspicious	1
or	1
inconsistent,	1
nothing	1
to	1
require	1
more	1
motives	1
than	1
appeared,	1
in	1
Mr	1
Elliot's	1
great	1
desire	1
of	1
a	1
reconciliation.	1
In	1
Lady	1
Russell's	1
view,	1
it	1
was	1
perfectly	1
natural	1
that	1
Mr	1
Elliot,	1
at	1
a	1
mature	1
time	1
of	1
life,	1
should	1
feel	1
it	1
a	1
most	1
desirable	1
object,	1
and	1
what	1
would	1
very	1
generally	1
recommend	1
him	1
among	1
all	1
sensible	1
people,	1
to	1
be	1
on	1
good	1
terms	1
with	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
his	1
family;	1
the	1
simplest	1
process	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
of	1
time	1
upon	1
a	1
head	1
naturally	1
clear,	1
and	1
only	1
erring	1
in	1
the	1
heyday	1
of	1
youth.	1
Anne	1
presumed,	1
however,	1
still	1
to	1
smile	1
about	1
it,	1
and	1
at	1
last	1
to	1
mention	1
"Elizabeth."	1
Lady	1
Russell	1
listened,	1
and	1
looked,	1
and	1
made	1
only	1
this	1
cautious	1
reply:--"Elizabeth!	1
very	1
well;	1
time	1
will	1
explain."	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
reference	1
to	1
the	1
future,	1
which	1
Anne,	1
after	1
a	1
little	1
observation,	1
felt	1
she	1
must	1
submit	1
to.	1
She	1
could	1
determine	1
nothing	1
at	1
present.	1
In	1
that	1
house	1
Elizabeth	1
must	1
be	1
first;	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
habit	1
of	1
such	1
general	1
observance	1
as	1
"Miss	1
Elliot,"	1
that	1
any	1
particularity	1
of	1
attention	1
seemed	1
almost	1
impossible.	1
Mr	1
Elliot,	1
too,	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
remembered,	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
a	1
widower	1
seven	1
months.	1
A	1
little	1
delay	1
on	1
his	1
side	1
might	1
be	1
very	1
excusable.	1
In	1
fact,	1
Anne	1
could	1
never	1
see	1
the	1
crape	1
round	1
his	1
hat,	1
without	1
fearing	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
the	1
inexcusable	1
one,	1
in	1
attributing	1
to	1
him	1
such	1
imaginations;	1
for	1
though	1
his	1
marriage	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
very	1
happy,	1
still	1
it	1
had	1
existed	1
so	1
many	1
years	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
comprehend	1
a	1
very	1
rapid	1
recovery	1
from	1
the	1
awful	1
impression	1
of	1
its	1
being	1
dissolved.	1
However	1
it	1
might	1
end,	1
he	1
was	1
without	1
any	1
question	1
their	1
pleasantest	1
acquaintance	1
in	1
Bath:	1
she	1
saw	1
nobody	1
equal	1
to	1
him;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
indulgence	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
him	1
about	1
Lyme,	1
which	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
as	1
lively	1
a	1
wish	1
to	1
see	1
again,	1
and	1
to	1
see	1
more	1
of,	1
as	1
herself.	1
They	1
went	1
through	1
the	1
particulars	1
of	1
their	1
first	1
meeting	1
a	1
great	1
many	1
times.	1
He	1
gave	1
her	1
to	1
understand	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
with	1
some	1
earnestness.	1
She	1
knew	1
it	1
well;	1
and	1
she	1
remembered	1
another	1
person's	1
look	1
also.	1
They	1
did	1
not	1
always	1
think	1
alike.	1
His	1
value	1
for	1
rank	1
and	1
connexion	1
she	1
perceived	1
was	1
greater	1
than	1
hers.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
merely	1
complaisance,	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
liking	1
to	1
the	1
cause,	1
which	1
made	1
him	1
enter	1
warmly	1
into	1
her	1
father	1
and	1
sister's	1
solicitudes	1
on	1
a	1
subject	1
which	1
she	1
thought	1
unworthy	1
to	1
excite	1
them.	1
The	1
Bath	1
paper	1
one	1
morning	1
announced	1
the	1
arrival	1
of	1
the	1
Dowager	1
Viscountess	1
Dalrymple,	1
and	1
her	1
daughter,	1
the	1
Honourable	1
Miss	1
Carteret;	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
comfort	1
of	1
No.--,	1
Camden	1
Place,	1
was	1
swept	1
away	1
for	1
many	1
days;	1
for	1
the	1
Dalrymples	1
(in	1
Anne's	1
opinion,	1
most	1
unfortunately)	1
were	1
cousins	1
of	1
the	1
Elliots;	1
and	1
the	1
agony	1
was	1
how	1
to	1
introduce	1
themselves	1
properly.	1
Anne	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
her	1
father	1
and	1
sister	1
before	1
in	1
contact	1
with	1
nobility,	1
and	1
she	1
must	1
acknowledge	1
herself	1
disappointed.	1
She	1
had	1
hoped	1
better	1
things	1
from	1
their	1
high	1
ideas	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
situation	1
in	1
life,	1
and	1
was	1
reduced	1
to	1
form	1
a	1
wish	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
never	1
foreseen;	1
a	1
wish	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
more	1
pride;	1
for	1
"our	1
cousins	1
Lady	1
Dalrymple	1
and	1
Miss	1
Carteret;"	1
"our	1
cousins,	1
the	1
Dalrymples,"	1
sounded	1
in	1
her	1
ears	1
all	1
day	1
long.	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
had	1
once	1
been	1
in	1
company	1
with	1
the	1
late	1
viscount,	1
but	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
family;	1
and	1
the	1
difficulties	1
of	1
the	1
case	1
arose	1
from	1
there	1
having	1
been	1
a	1
suspension	1
of	1
all	1
intercourse	1
by	1
letters	1
of	1
ceremony,	1
ever	1
since	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
that	1
said	1
late	1
viscount,	1
when,	1
in	1
consequence	1
of	1
a	1
dangerous	1
illness	1
of	1
Sir	1
Walter's	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
an	1
unlucky	1
omission	1
at	1
Kellynch.	1
No	1
letter	1
of	1
condolence	1
had	1
been	1
sent	1
to	1
Ireland.	1
The	1
neglect	1
had	1
been	1
visited	1
on	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
sinner;	1
for	1
when	1
poor	1
Lady	1
Elliot	1
died	1
herself,	1
no	1
letter	1
of	1
condolence	1
was	1
received	1
at	1
Kellynch,	1
and,	1
consequently,	1
there	1
was	1
but	1
too	1
much	1
reason	1
to	1
apprehend	1
that	1
the	1
Dalrymples	1
considered	1
the	1
relationship	1
as	1
closed.	1
How	1
to	1
have	1
this	1
anxious	1
business	1
set	1
to	1
rights,	1
and	1
be	1
admitted	1
as	1
cousins	1
again,	1
was	1
the	1
question:	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
question	1
which,	1
in	1
a	1
more	1
rational	1
manner,	1
neither	1
Lady	1
Russell	1
nor	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
thought	1
unimportant.	1
"Family	1
connexions	1
were	1
always	1
worth	1
preserving,	1
good	1
company	1
always	1
worth	1
seeking;	1
Lady	1
Dalrymple	1
had	1
taken	1
a	1
house,	1
for	1
three	1
months,	1
in	1
Laura	1
Place,	1
and	1
would	1
be	1
living	1
in	1
style.	1
She	1
had	1
been	1
at	1
Bath	1
the	1
year	1
before,	1
and	1
Lady	1
Russell	1
had	1
heard	1
her	1
spoken	1
of	1
as	1
a	1
charming	1
woman.	1
It	1
was	1
very	1
desirable	1
that	1
the	1
connexion	1
should	1
be	1
renewed,	1
if	1
it	1
could	1
be	1
done,	1
without	1
any	1
compromise	1
of	1
propriety	1
on	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
Elliots."	1
Sir	1
Walter,	1
however,	1
would	1
choose	1
his	1
own	1
means,	1
and	1
at	1
last	1
wrote	1
a	1
very	1
fine	1
letter	1
of	1
ample	1
explanation,	1
regret,	1
and	1
entreaty,	1
to	1
his	1
right	1
honourable	1
cousin.	1
Neither	1
Lady	1
Russell	1
nor	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
could	1
admire	1
the	1
letter;	1
but	1
it	1
did	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
wanted,	1
in	1
bringing	1
three	1
lines	1
of	1
scrawl	1
from	1
the	1
Dowager	1
Viscountess.	1
"She	1
was	1
very	1
much	1
honoured,	1
and	1
should	1
be	1
happy	1
in	1
their	1
acquaintance."	1
The	1
toils	1
of	1
the	1
business	1
were	1
over,	1
the	1
sweets	1
began.	1
They	1
visited	1
in	1
Laura	1
Place,	1
they	1
had	1
the	1
cards	1
of	1
Dowager	1
Viscountess	1
Dalrymple,	1
and	1
the	1
Honourable	1
Miss	1
Carteret,	1
to	1
be	1
arranged	1
wherever	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
most	1
visible:	1
and	1
"Our	1
cousins	1
in	1
Laura	1
Place,"--"Our	1
cousin,	1
Lady	1
Dalrymple	1
and	1
Miss	1
Carteret,"	1
were	1
talked	1
of	1
to	1
everybody.	1
Anne	1
was	1
ashamed.	1
Had	1
Lady	1
Dalrymple	1
and	1
her	1
daughter	1
even	1
been	1
very	1
agreeable,	1
she	1
would	1
still	1
have	1
been	1
ashamed	1
of	1
the	1
agitation	1
they	1
created,	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
nothing.	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
superiority	1
of	1
manner,	1
accomplishment,	1
or	1
understanding.	1
Lady	1
Dalrymple	1
had	1
acquired	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
"a	1
charming	1
woman,"	1
because	1
she	1
had	1
a	1
smile	1
and	1
a	1
civil	1
answer	1
for	1
everybody.	1
Miss	1
Carteret,	1
with	1
still	1
less	1
to	1
say,	1
was	1
so	1
plain	1
and	1
so	1
awkward,	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
never	1
have	1
been	1
tolerated	1
in	1
Camden	1
Place	1
but	1
for	1
her	1
birth.	1
Lady	1
Russell	1
confessed	1
she	1
had	1
expected	1
something	1
better;	1
but	1
yet	1
"it	1
was	1
an	1
acquaintance	1
worth	1
having;"	1
and	1
when	1
Anne	1
ventured	1
to	1
speak	1
her	1
opinion	1
of	1
them	1
to	1
Mr	1
Elliot,	1
he	1
agreed	1
to	1
their	1
being	1
nothing	1
in	1
themselves,	1
but	1
still	1
maintained	1
that,	1
as	1
a	1
family	1
connexion,	1
as	1
good	1
company,	1
as	1
those	1
who	1
would	1
collect	1
good	1
company	1
around	1
them,	1
they	1
had	1
their	1
value.	1
Anne	1
smiled	1
and	1
said,	1
"My	1
idea	1
of	1
good	1
company,	1
Mr	1
Elliot,	1
is	1
the	1
company	1
of	1
clever,	1
well-informed	1
people,	1
who	1
have	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
conversation;	1
that	1
is	1
what	1
I	1
call	1
good	1
company."	1
"You	1
are	1
mistaken,"	1
said	1
he	1
gently,	1
"that	1
is	1
not	1
good	1
company;	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
best.	1
Good	1
company	1
requires	1
only	1
birth,	1
education,	1
and	1
manners,	1
and	1
with	1
regard	1
to	1
education	1
is	1
not	1
very	1
nice.	1
Birth	1
and	1
good	1
manners	1
are	1
essential;	1
but	1
a	1
little	1
learning	1
is	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
a	1
dangerous	1
thing	1
in	1
good	1
company;	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
it	1
will	1
do	1
very	1
well.	1
My	1
cousin	1
Anne	1
shakes	1
her	1
head.	1
She	1
is	1
not	1
satisfied.	1
She	1
is	1
fastidious.	1
My	1
dear	1
cousin"	1
(sitting	1
down	1
by	1
her),	1
"you	1
have	1
a	1
better	1
right	1
to	1
be	1
fastidious	1
than	1
almost	1
any	1
other	1
woman	1
I	1
know;	1
but	1
will	1
it	1
answer?	1
Will	1
it	1
make	1
you	1
happy?	1
Will	1
it	1
not	1
be	1
wiser	1
to	1
accept	1
the	1
society	1
of	1
those	1
good	1
ladies	1
in	1
Laura	1
Place,	1
and	1
enjoy	1
all	1
the	1
advantages	1
of	1
the	1
connexion	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
possible?	1
You	1
may	1
depend	1
upon	1
it,	1
that	1
they	1
will	1
move	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
set	1
in	1
Bath	1
this	1
winter,	1
and	1
as	1
rank	1
is	1
rank,	1
your	1
being	1
known	1
to	1
be	1
related	1
to	1
them	1
will	1
have	1
its	1
use	1
in	1
fixing	1
your	1
family	1
(our	1
family	1
let	1
me	1
say)	1
in	1
that	1
degree	1
of	1
consideration	1
which	1
we	1
must	1
all	1
wish	1
for."	1
"Yes,"	1
sighed	1
Anne,	1
"we	1
shall,	1
indeed,	1
be	1
known	1
to	1
be	1
related	1
to	1
them!"	1
then	1
recollecting	1
herself,	1
and	1
not	1
wishing	1
to	1
be	1
answered,	1
she	1
added,	1
"I	1
certainly	1
do	1
think	1
there	1
has	1
been	1
by	1
far	1
too	1
much	1
trouble	1
taken	1
to	1
procure	1
the	1
acquaintance.	1
I	1
suppose"	1
(smiling)	1
"I	1
have	1
more	1
pride	1
than	1
any	1
of	1
you;	1
but	1
I	1
confess	1
it	1
does	1
vex	1
me,	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
be	1
so	1
solicitous	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
relationship	1
acknowledged,	1
which	1
we	1
may	1
be	1
very	1
sure	1
is	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
perfect	1
indifference	1
to	1
them."	1
"Pardon	1
me,	1
dear	1
cousin,	1
you	1
are	1
unjust	1
in	1
your	1
own	1
claims.	1
In	1
London,	1
perhaps,	1
in	1
your	1
present	1
quiet	1
style	1
of	1
living,	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
as	1
you	1
say:	1
but	1
in	1
Bath;	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
Elliot	1
and	1
his	1
family	1
will	1
always	1
be	1
worth	1
knowing:	1
always	1
acceptable	1
as	1
acquaintance."	1
"Well,"	1
said	1
Anne,	1
"I	1
certainly	1
am	1
proud,	1
too	1
proud	1
to	1
enjoy	1
a	1
welcome	1
which	1
depends	1
so	1
entirely	1
upon	1
place."	1
"I	1
love	1
your	1
indignation,"	1
said	1
he;	1
"it	1
is	1
very	1
natural.	1
But	1
here	1
you	1
are	1
in	1
Bath,	1
and	1
the	1
object	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
established	1
here	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
credit	1
and	1
dignity	1
which	1
ought	1
to	1
belong	1
to	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
Elliot.	1
You	1
talk	1
of	1
being	1
proud;	1
I	1
am	1
called	1
proud,	1
I	1
know,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
believe	1
myself	1
otherwise;	1
for	1
our	1
pride,	1
if	1
investigated,	1
would	1
have	1
the	1
same	1
object,	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
doubt,	1
though	1
the	1
kind	1
may	1
seem	1
a	1
little	1
different.	1
In	1
one	1
point,	1
I	1
am	1
sure,	1
my	1
dear	1
cousin,"	1
(he	1
continued,	1
speaking	1
lower,	1
though	1
there	1
was	1

room)	1
"in	1
one	1
point,	1
I	1
am	1
sure,	1
we	1
must	1
feel	1
alike.	1
We	1
must	1
feel	1
that	1
every	1
addition	1
to	1
your	1
father's	1
society,	1
among	1
his	1
equals	1

superiors,	1
may	1
be	1
of	1

his	1

him."	1
He	1
looked,	1
as	1
he	1
spoke,	1
to	1
the	1
seat	1
which	1
Mrs	1
Clay	1
had	1
been	1
lately	1
occupying:	1
a	1
sufficient	1
explanation	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
particularly	1
meant;	1
and	1
though	1
Anne	1
could	1
not	1
believe	1
in	1
their	1
having	1
the	1
same	1
sort	1
of	1
pride,	1
she	1
was	1
pleased	1
with	1
him	1
for	1
not	1
liking	1
Mrs	1
Clay;	1
and	1
her	1
conscience	1
admitted	1
that	1
his	1
wishing	1
to	1
promote	1
her	1
father's	1
getting	1
great	1
acquaintance	1
was	1
more	1
than	1
excusable	1
in	1
the	1
view	1
of	1
defeating	1
her.	1
Chapter	1
17	1
While	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
were	1
assiduously	1
pushing	1
their	1
good	1
fortune	1
in	1
Laura	1
Place,	1
Anne	1
was	1
renewing	1
an	1
acquaintance	1
of	1
a	1
very	1
different	1
description.	1
She	1
had	1
called	1
on	1
her	1
former	1
governess,	1
and	1
had	1
heard	1
from	1
her	1
of	1
there	1
being	1
an	1
old	1
school-fellow	1
in	1
Bath,	1
who	1
had	1
the	1
two	1
strong	1
claims	1
on	1
her	1
attention	1
of	1
past	1
kindness	1
and	1
present	1
suffering.	1
Miss	1
Hamilton,	1
now	1
Mrs	1
Smith,	1
had	1
shewn	1
her	1
kindness	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
periods	1
of	1
her	1
life	1
when	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
most	1
valuable.	1
Anne	1
had	1
gone	1
unhappy	1
to	1
school,	1
grieving	1
for	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
a	1
mother	1
whom	1
she	1
had	1
dearly	1
loved,	1
feeling	1
her	1
separation	1
from	1
home,	1
and	1
suffering	1
as	1
a	1
girl	1
of	1
fourteen,	1
of	1
strong	1
sensibility	1
and	1
not	1
high	1
spirits,	1
must	1
suffer	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
time;	1
and	1
Miss	1
Hamilton,	1
three	1
years	1
older	1
than	1
herself,	1
but	1
still	1
from	1
the	1
want	1
of	1
near	1
relations	1
and	1
a	1
settled	1
home,	1
remaining	1
another	1
year	1
at	1
school,	1
had	1
been	1
useful	1
and	1
good	1
to	1
her	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
which	1
had	1
considerably	1
lessened	1
her	1
misery,	1
and	1
could	1
never	1
be	1
remembered	1
with	1
indifference.	1
Miss	1
Hamilton	1
had	1
left	1
school,	1
had	1
married	1
not	1
long	1
afterwards,	1
was	1
said	1
to	1
have	1
married	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
fortune,	1
and	1
this	1
was	1
all	1
that	1
Anne	1
had	1
known	1
of	1
her,	1
till	1
now	1
that	1
their	1
governess's	1
account	1
brought	1
her	1
situation	1
forward	1
in	1
a	1
more	1
decided	1
but	1
very	1
different	1
form.	1
She	1
was	1
a	1
widow	1
and	1
poor.	1
Her	1
husband	1
had	1
been	1
extravagant;	1
and	1
at	1
his	1
death,	1
about	1
two	1
years	1
before,	1
had	1
left	1
his	1
affairs	1
dreadfully	1
involved.	1
She	1
had	1
had	1
difficulties	1
of	1
every	1
sort	1
to	1
contend	1
with,	1
and	1
in	1
addition	1
to	1
these	1
distresses	1
had	1
been	1
afflicted	1
with	1
a	1
severe	1
rheumatic	1
fever,	1
which,	1
finally	1
settling	1
in	1
her	1
legs,	1
had	1
made	1
her	1
for	1
the	1
present	1
a	1
cripple.	1
She	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
Bath	1
on	1
that	1
account,	1
and	1
was	1
now	1
in	1
lodgings	1
near	1
the	1
hot	1
baths,	1
living	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
humble	1
way,	1
unable	1
even	1
to	1
afford	1
herself	1
the	1
comfort	1
of	1
a	1
servant,	1
and	1
of	1
course	1
almost	1
excluded	1
from	1
society.	1
Their	1
mutual	1
friend	1
answered	1
for	1
the	1
satisfaction	1
which	1
a	1
visit	1
from	1
Miss	1
Elliot	1
would	1
give	1
Mrs	1
Smith,	1
and	1
Anne	1
therefore	1
lost	1
no	1
time	1
in	1
going.	1
She	1
mentioned	1
nothing	1
of	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
heard,	1
or	1
what	1
she	1
intended,	1
at	1
home.	1
It	1
would	1
excite	1
no	1
proper	1
interest	1
there.	1
She	1
only	1
consulted	1
Lady	1
Russell,	1
who	1
entered	1
thoroughly	1
into	1
her	1
sentiments,	1
and	1
was	1
most	1
happy	1
to	1
convey	1
her	1
as	1
near	1
to	1
Mrs	1
Smith's	1
lodgings	1
in	1
Westgate	1
Buildings,	1
as	1
Anne	1
chose	1
to	1
be	1
taken.	1
The	1
visit	1
was	1
paid,	1
their	1
acquaintance	1
re-established,	1
their	1
interest	1
in	1
each	1
other	1
more	1
than	1
re-kindled.	1
The	1
first	1
ten	1
minutes	1
had	1
its	1
awkwardness	1
and	1
its	1
emotion.	1
Twelve	1
years	1
were	1
gone	1
since	1
they	1
had	1
parted,	1
and	1
each	1
presented	1
a	1
somewhat	1
different	1
person	1
from	1
what	1
the	1
other	1
had	1
imagined.	1
Twelve	1
years	1
had	1
changed	1
Anne	1
from	1
the	1
blooming,	1
silent,	1
unformed	1
girl	1
of	1
fifteen,	1
to	1
the	1
elegant	1
little	1
woman	1
of	1
seven-and-twenty,	1
with	1
every	1
beauty	1
except	1
bloom,	1
and	1
with	1
manners	1
as	1
consciously	1
right	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
invariably	1
gentle;	1
and	1
twelve	1
years	1
had	1
transformed	1
the	1
fine-looking,	1
well-grown	1
Miss	1
Hamilton,	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
glow	1
of	1
health	1
and	1
confidence	1
of	1
superiority,	1
into	1
a	1
poor,	1
infirm,	1
helpless	1
widow,	1
receiving	1
the	1
visit	1
of	1
her	1
former	1
protegee	1
as	1
a	1
favour;	1
but	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
uncomfortable	1
in	1
the	1
meeting	1
had	1
soon	1
passed	1
away,	1
and	1
left	1
only	1
the	1
interesting	1
charm	1
of	1
remembering	1
former	1
partialities	1
and	1
talking	1
over	1
old	1
times.	1
Anne	1
found	1
in	1
Mrs	1
Smith	1
the	1
good	1
sense	1
and	1
agreeable	1
manners	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
almost	1
ventured	1
to	1
depend	1
on,	1
and	1
a	1
disposition	1
to	1
converse	1
and	1
be	1
cheerful	1
beyond	1
her	1
expectation.	1
Neither	1
the	1
dissipations	1
of	1
the	1
past--and	1
she	1
had	1
lived	1
very	1
much	1
in	1
the	1
world--nor	1
the	1
restrictions	1
of	1
the	1
present,	1
neither	1
sickness	1
nor	1
sorrow	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
closed	1
her	1
heart	1
or	1
ruined	1
her	1
spirits.	1
In	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
a	1
second	1
visit	1
she	1
talked	1
with	1
great	1
openness,	1
and	1
Anne's	1
astonishment	1
increased.	1
She	1
could	1
scarcely	1
imagine	1
a	1
more	1
cheerless	1
situation	1
in	1
itself	1
than	1
Mrs	1
Smith's.	1
She	1
had	1
been	1
very	1
fond	1
of	1
her	1
husband:	1
she	1
had	1
buried	1
him.	1
She	1
had	1
been	1
used	1
to	1
affluence:	1
it	1
was	1
gone.	1
She	1
had	1
no	1
child	1
to	1
connect	1
her	1
with	1
life	1
and	1
happiness	1
again,	1
no	1
relations	1
to	1
assist	1
in	1
the	1
arrangement	1
of	1
perplexed	1
affairs,	1
no	1
health	1
to	1
make	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
supportable.	1
Her	1
accommodations	1
were	1
limited	1
to	1
a	1
noisy	1
parlour,	1
and	1
a	1
dark	1
bedroom	1
behind,	1
with	1
no	1
possibility	1
of	1
moving	1
from	1
one	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
without	1
assistance,	1
which	1
there	1
was	1
only	1
one	1
servant	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
to	1
afford,	1
and	1
she	1
never	1
quitted	1
the	1
house	1
but	1
to	1
be	1
conveyed	1
into	1
the	1
warm	1
bath.	1
Yet,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
this,	1
Anne	1
had	1
reason	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
moments	1
only	1
of	1
languor	1
and	1
depression,	1
to	1
hours	1
of	1
occupation	1
and	1
enjoyment.	1
How	1
could	1
it	1
be?	1
She	1
watched,	1
observed,	1
reflected,	1
and	1
finally	1
determined	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
case	1
of	1
fortitude	1
or	1
of	1
resignation	1
only.	1
A	1
submissive	1
spirit	1
might	1
be	1
patient,	1
a	1
strong	1
understanding	1
would	1
supply	1
resolution,	1
but	1
here	1
was	1
something	1
more;	1
here	1
was	1
that	1
elasticity	1
of	1
mind,	1
that	1
disposition	1
to	1
be	1
comforted,	1
that	1
power	1
of	1
turning	1
readily	1
from	1
evil	1
to	1
good,	1
and	1
of	1
finding	1
employment	1
which	1
carried	1
her	1
out	1
of	1
herself,	1
which	1
was	1
from	1
nature	1
alone.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
choicest	1
gift	1
of	1
Heaven;	1
and	1
Anne	1
viewed	1
her	1
friend	1
as	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
instances	1
in	1
which,	1
by	1
a	1
merciful	1
appointment,	1
it	1
seems	1
designed	1
to	1
counterbalance	1
almost	1
every	1
other	1
want.	1
There	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
time,	1
Mrs	1
Smith	1
told	1
her,	1
when	1
her	1
spirits	1
had	1
nearly	1
failed.	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
call	1
herself	1
an	1
invalid	1
now,	1
compared	1
with	1
her	1
state	1
on	1
first	1
reaching	1
Bath.	1
Then	1
she	1
had,	1
indeed,	1
been	1
a	1
pitiable	1
object;	1
for	1
she	1
had	1
caught	1
cold	1
on	1
the	1
journey,	1
and	1
had	1
hardly	1
taken	1
possession	1
of	1
her	1
lodgings	1
before	1
she	1
was	1
again	1
confined	1
to	1
her	1
bed	1
and	1
suffering	1
under	1
severe	1
and	1
constant	1
pain;	1
and	1
all	1
this	1
among	1
strangers,	1
with	1
the	1
absolute	1
necessity	1
of	1
having	1
a	1
regular	1
nurse,	1
and	1
finances	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
particularly	1
unfit	1
to	1
meet	1
any	1
extraordinary	1
expense.	1
She	1
had	1
weathered	1
it,	1
however,	1
and	1
could	1
truly	1
say	1
that	1
it	1
had	1
done	1
her	1
good.	1
It	1
had	1
increased	1
her	1
comforts	1
by	1
making	1
her	1
feel	1
herself	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
good	1
hands.	1
She	1
had	1
seen	1
too	1
much	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
to	1
expect	1
sudden	1
or	1
disinterested	1
attachment	1
anywhere,	1
but	1
her	1
illness	1
had	1
proved	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
her	1
landlady	1
had	1
a	1
character	1
to	1
preserve,	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
use	1
her	1
ill;	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
particularly	1
fortunate	1
in	1
her	1
nurse,	1
as	1
a	1
sister	1
of	1
her	1
landlady,	1
a	1
nurse	1
by	1
profession,	1
and	1
who	1
had	1
always	1
a	1
home	1
in	1
that	1
house	1
when	1
unemployed,	1
chanced	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
liberty	1
just	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
attend	1
her.	1
"And	1
she,"	1
said	1
Mrs	1
Smith,	1
"besides	1
nursing	1
me	1
most	1
admirably,	1
has	1
really	1
proved	1
an	1
invaluable	1
acquaintance.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
I	1
could	1
use	1
my	1
hands	1
she	1
taught	1
me	1
to	1
knit,	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
a	1
great	1
amusement;	1
and	1
she	1
put	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
making	1
these	1
little	1
thread-cases,	1
pin-cushions	1
and	1
card-racks,	1
which	1
you	1
always	1
find	1
me	1
so	1
busy	1
about,	1
and	1
which	1
supply	1
me	1
with	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
doing	1
a	1
little	1
good	1
to	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
very	1
poor	1
families	1
in	1
this	1
neighbourhood.	1
She	1
had	1
a	1
large	1
acquaintance,	1
of	1
course	1
professionally,	1
among	1
those	1
who	1
can	1
afford	1
to	1
buy,	1
and	1
she	1
disposes	1
of	1
my	1
merchandise.	1
She	1
always	1
takes	1
the	1
right	1
time	1
for	1
applying.	1
Everybody's	1
heart	1
is	1
open,	1
you	1
know,	1
when	1
they	1
have	1
recently	1
escaped	1
from	1
severe	1
pain,	1
or	1
are	1
recovering	1
the	1
blessing	1
of	1
health,	1
and	1
Nurse	1
Rooke	1
thoroughly	1
understands	1
when	1
to	1
speak.	1
She	1
is	1
a	1
shrewd,	1
intelligent,	1
sensible	1
woman.	1
Hers	1
is	1
a	1
line	1
for	1
seeing	1
human	1
nature;	1
and	1
she	1
has	1
a	1
fund	1
of	1
good	1
sense	1
and	1
observation,	1
which,	1
as	1
a	1
companion,	1
make	1
her	1
infinitely	1
superior	1
to	1
thousands	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
having	1
only	1
received	1
`the	1
best	1
education	1
in	1
the	1
world,'	1
know	1
nothing	1
worth	1
attending	1
to.	1
Call	1
it	1
gossip,	1
if	1
you	1
will,	1
but	1
when	1
Nurse	1
Rooke	1
has	1
half	1
an	1
hour's	1
leisure	1
to	1
bestow	1
on	1
me,	1
she	1
is	1
sure	1
to	1
have	1
something	1
to	1
relate	1
that	1
is	1
entertaining	1
and	1
profitable:	1
something	1
that	1
makes	1
one	1
know	1
one's	1
species	1
better.	1
One	1
likes	1
to	1
hear	1
what	1
is	1
going	1
on,	1
to	1
be	1
au	1
fait	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
newest	1
modes	1
of	1
being	1
trifling	1
and	1
silly.	1
To	1
me,	1
who	1
live	1
so	1
much	1
alone,	1
her	1
conversation,	1
I	1
assure	1
you,	1
is	1
a	1
treat."	1
Anne,	1
far	1
from	1
wishing	1
to	1
cavil	1
at	1
the	1
pleasure,	1
replied,	1
"I	1
can	1
easily	1
believe	1
it.	1
Women	1
of	1
that	1
class	1
have	1
great	1
opportunities,	1
and	1
if	1
they	1
are	1
intelligent	1
may	1
be	1
well	1
worth	1
listening	1
to.	1
Such	1
varieties	1
of	1
human	1
nature	1
as	1
they	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
habit	1
of	1
witnessing!	1
And	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
merely	1
in	1
its	1
follies,	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
well	1
read;	1
for	1
they	1
see	1
it	1
occasionally	1
under	1
every	1
circumstance	1
that	1
can	1
be	1
most	1
interesting	1
or	1
affecting.	1
What	1
instances	1
must	1
pass	1
before	1
them	1
of	1
ardent,	1
disinterested,	1
self-denying	1
attachment,	1
of	1
heroism,	1
fortitude,	1
patience,	1
resignation:	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
conflicts	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
sacrifices	1
that	1
ennoble	1
us	1
most.	1
A	1
sick	1
chamber	1
may	1
often	1
furnish	1
the	1
worth	1
of	1
volumes."	1
"Yes,"	1
said	1
Mrs	1
Smith	1
more	1
doubtingly,	1
"sometimes	1
it	1
may,	1
though	1
I	1
fear	1
its	1
lessons	1
are	1
not	1
often	1
in	1
the	1
elevated	1
style	1
you	1
describe.	1
Here	1
and	1
there,	1
human	1
nature	1
may	1
be	1
great	1
in	1
times	1
of	1
trial;	1
but	1
generally	1
speaking,	1
it	1
is	1
its	1
weakness	1
and	1
not	1
its	1
strength	1
that	1
appears	1
in	1
a	1
sick	1
chamber:	1
it	1
is	1
selfishness	1
and	1
impatience	1
rather	1
than	1
generosity	1
and	1
fortitude,	1
that	1
one	1
hears	1
of.	1
There	1
is	1
so	1
little	1
real	1
friendship	1
in	1
the	1
world!	1
and	1
unfortunately"	1
(speaking	1
low	1
and	1
tremulously)	1
"there	1
are	1
so	1
many	1
who	1
forget	1
to	1
think	1
seriously	1
till	1
it	1
is	1
almost	1
too	1
late."	1
Anne	1
saw	1
the	1
misery	1
of	1
such	1
feelings.	1
The	1
husband	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
what	1
he	1
ought,	1
and	1
the	1
wife	1
had	1
been	1
led	1
among	1
that	1
part	1
of	1
mankind	1
which	1
made	1
her	1
think	1
worse	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
than	1
she	1
hoped	1
it	1
deserved.	1
It	1
was	1
but	1
a	1
passing	1
emotion	1
however	1
with	1
Mrs	1
Smith;	1
she	1
shook	1
it	1
off,	1
and	1
soon	1
added	1
in	1
a	1
different	1
tone--	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
suppose	1
the	1
situation	1
my	1
friend	1
Mrs	1
Rooke	1
is	1
in	1
at	1
present,	1
will	1
furnish	1
much	1
either	1
to	1
interest	1
or	1
edify	1
me.	1
She	1
is	1
only	1
nursing	1
Mrs	1
Wallis	1
of	1
Marlborough	1
Buildings;	1
a	1
mere	1
pretty,	1
silly,	1
expensive,	1
fashionable	1
woman,	1
I	1
believe;	1
and	1
of	1
course	1
will	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
report	1
but	1
of	1
lace	1
and	1
finery.	1
I	1
mean	1
to	1
make	1
my	1
profit	1
of	1
Mrs	1
Wallis,	1
however.	1
She	1
has	1
plenty	1
of	1
money,	1
and	1
I	1
intend	1
she	1
shall	1
buy	1
all	1
the	1
high-priced	1
things	1
I	1
have	1
in	1
hand	1
now."	1
Anne	1
had	1
called	1
several	1
times	1
on	1
her	1
friend,	1
before	1
the	1
existence	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
person	1
was	1
known	1
in	1
Camden	1
Place.	1
At	1
last,	1
it	1
became	1
necessary	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
her.	1
Sir	1
Walter,	1
Elizabeth	1
and	1
Mrs	1
Clay,	1
returned	1
one	1
morning	1
from	1
Laura	1
Place,	1
with	1
a	1
sudden	1
invitation	1
from	1
Lady	1
Dalrymple	1
for	1
the	1
same	1
evening,	1
and	1
Anne	1
was	1
already	1
engaged,	1
to	1
spend	1
that	1
evening	1
in	1
Westgate	1
Buildings.	1
She	1
was	1
not	1
sorry	1
for	1
the	1
excuse.	1
They	1
were	1
only	1
asked,	1
she	1
was	1
sure,	1
because	1
Lady	1
Dalrymple	1
being	1
kept	1
at	1
home	1
by	1
a	1
bad	1
cold,	1
was	1
glad	1
to	1
make	1
use	1
of	1
the	1
relationship	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
pressed	1
on	1
her;	1
and	1
she	1
declined	1
on	1
her	1
own	1
account	1
with	1
great	1
alacrity--"She	1
was	1
engaged	1
to	1
spend	1
the	1
evening	1
with	1
an	1
old	1
schoolfellow."	1
They	1
were	1
not	1
much	1
interested	1
in	1
anything	1
relative	1
to	1
Anne;	1
but	1
still	1
there	1
were	1
questions	1
enough	1
asked,	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
understood	1
what	1
this	1
old	1
schoolfellow	1
was;	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
disdainful,	1
and	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
severe.	1
"Westgate	1
Buildings!"	1
said	1
he,	1
"and	1
who	1
is	1
Miss	1
Anne	1
Elliot	1
to	1
be	1
visiting	1
in	1
Westgate	1
Buildings?	1
A	1
Mrs	1
Smith.	1
A	1
widow	1
Mrs	1
Smith;	1
and	1
who	1
was	1
her	1
husband?	1
One	1
of	1
five	1
thousand	1
Mr	1
Smiths	1
whose	1
names	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
met	1
with	1
everywhere.	1
And	1
what	1
is	1
her	1
attraction?	1
That	1
she	1
is	1
old	1
and	1
sickly.	1
Upon	1
my	1
word,	1
Miss	1
Anne	1
Elliot,	1
you	1
have	1
the	1
most	1
extraordinary	1
taste!	1
Everything	1
that	1
revolts	1
other	1
people,	1
low	1
company,	1
paltry	1
rooms,	1
foul	1
air,	1
disgusting	1
associations	1
are	1
inviting	1
to	1
you.	1
But	1
surely	1
you	1
may	1
put	1
off	1
this	1
old	1
lady	1
till	1
to-morrow:	1
she	1
is	1
not	1
so	1
near	1
her	1
end,	1
I	1
presume,	1
but	1
that	1
she	1
may	1
hope	1
to	1
see	1
another	1
day.	1
What	1
is	1
her	1
age?	1
Forty?"	1
"No,	1
sir,	1
she	1
is	1
not	1
one-and-thirty;	1
but	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
I	1
can	1
put	1
off	1
my	1
engagement,	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
only	1
evening	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
which	1
will	1
at	1
once	1
suit	1
her	1
and	1
myself.	1
She	1
goes	1
into	1
the	1
warm	1
bath	1
to-morrow,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
week,	1
you	1
know,	1
we	1
are	1
engaged."	1
"But	1
what	1
does	1
Lady	1
Russell	1
think	1
of	1
this	1
acquaintance?"	1
asked	1
Elizabeth.	1
"She	1
sees	1
nothing	1
to	1
blame	1
in	1
it,"	1
replied	1
Anne;	1
"on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
she	1
approves	1
it,	1
and	1
has	1
generally	1
taken	1
me	1
when	1
I	1
have	1
called	1
on	1
Mrs	1
Smith.	1
"Westgate	1
Buildings	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
rather	1
surprised	1
by	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
a	1
carriage	1
drawn	1
up	1
near	1
its	1
pavement,"	1
observed	1
Sir	1
Walter.	1
"Sir	1
Henry	1
Russell's	1
widow,	1
indeed,	1
has	1
no	1
honours	1
to	1
distinguish	1
her	1
arms,	1
but	1
still	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
handsome	1
equipage,	1
and	1
no	1
doubt	1
is	1
well	1
known	1
to	1
convey	1
a	1
Miss	1
Elliot.	1
A	1
widow	1
Mrs	1
Smith	1
lodging	1
in	1
Westgate	1
Buildings!	1
A	1
poor	1
widow	1
barely	1
able	1
to	1
live,	1
between	1
thirty	1
and	1
forty;	1
a	1
mere	1
Mrs	1
Smith,	1
an	1
every-day	1
Mrs	1
Smith,	1
of	1
all	1
people	1
and	1
all	1
names	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
chosen	1
friend	1
of	1
Miss	1
Anne	1
Elliot,	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
preferred	1
by	1
her	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
family	1
connections	1
among	1
the	1
nobility	1
of	1
England	1
and	1
Ireland!	1
Mrs	1
Smith!	1
Such	1
a	1
name!"	1
Mrs	1
Clay,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
present	1
while	1
all	1
this	1
passed,	1
now	1
thought	1
it	1
advisable	1
to	1
leave	1
the	1
room,	1
and	1
Anne	1
could	1
have	1
said	1
much,	1
and	1
did	1
long	1
to	1
say	1
a	1
little	1
in	1
defence	1
of	1
her	1
friend's	1
not	1
very	1
dissimilar	1
claims	1
to	1
theirs,	1
but	1
her	1
sense	1
of	1
personal	1
respect	1
to	1
her	1
father	1
prevented	1
her.	1
She	1
made	1
no	1
reply.	1
She	1
left	1
it	1
to	1
himself	1
to	1
recollect,	1
that	1
Mrs	1
Smith	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
only	1
widow	1
in	1
Bath	1
between	1
thirty	1
and	1
forty,	1
with	1
little	1
to	1
live	1
on,	1
and	1
no	1
surname	1
of	1
dignity.	1
Anne	1
kept	1
her	1
appointment;	1
the	1
others	1
kept	1
theirs,	1
and	1
of	1
course	1
she	1
heard	1
the	1
next	1
morning	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
had	1
a	1
delightful	1
evening.	1
She	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
only	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
set	1
absent,	1
for	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
had	1
not	1
only	1
been	1
quite	1
at	1
her	1
ladyship's	1
service	1
themselves,	1
but	1
had	1
actually	1
been	1
happy	1
to	1
be	1
employed	1
by	1
her	1
in	1
collecting	1
others,	1
and	1
had	1
been	1
at	1
the	1
trouble	1
of	1
inviting	1
both	1
Lady	1
Russell	1
and	1
Mr	1
Elliot;	1
and	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
had	1
made	1
a	1
point	1
of	1
leaving	1
Colonel	1
Wallis	1
early,	1
and	1
Lady	1
Russell	1
had	1
fresh	1
arranged	1
all	1
her	1
evening	1
engagements	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
wait	1
on	1
her.	1
Anne	1
had	1
the	1
whole	1
history	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
such	1
an	1
evening	1
could	1
supply	1
from	1
Lady	1
Russell.	1
To	1
her,	1
its	1
greatest	1
interest	1
must	1
be,	1
in	1
having	1
been	1
very	1
much	1
talked	1
of	1
between	1
her	1
friend	1
and	1
Mr	1
Elliot;	1
in	1
having	1
been	1
wished	1
for,	1
regretted,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
honoured	1
for	1
staying	1
away	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
cause.	1
Her	1
kind,	1
compassionate	1
visits	1
to	1
this	1
old	1
schoolfellow,	1
sick	1
and	1
reduced,	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
quite	1
delighted	1
Mr	1
Elliot.	1
He	1
thought	1
her	1
a	1
most	1
extraordinary	1
young	1
woman;	1
in	1
her	1
temper,	1
manners,	1
mind,	1
a	1
model	1
of	1
female	1
excellence.	1
He	1
could	1
meet	1
even	1
Lady	1
Russell	1
in	1
a	1
discussion	1
of	1
her	1
merits;	1
and	1
Anne	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
given	1
to	1
understand	1
so	1
much	1
by	1
her	1
friend,	1
could	1
not	1
know	1
herself	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
highly	1
rated	1
by	1
a	1
sensible	1
man,	1
without	1
many	1
of	1
those	1
agreeable	1
sensations	1
which	1
her	1
friend	1
meant	1
to	1
create.	1
Lady	1
Russell	1
was	1
now	1
perfectly	1
decided	1
in	1
her	1
opinion	1
of	1
Mr	1
Elliot.	1
She	1
was	1
as	1
much	1
convinced	1
of	1
his	1
meaning	1
to	1
gain	1
Anne	1
in	1
time	1
as	1
of	1
his	1
deserving	1
her,	1
and	1
was	1
beginning	1
to	1
calculate	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
weeks	1
which	1
would	1
free	1
him	1
from	1
all	1
the	1
remaining	1
restraints	1
of	1
widowhood,	1
and	1
leave	1
him	1
at	1
liberty	1
to	1
exert	1
his	1
most	1
open	1
powers	1
of	1
pleasing.	1
She	1
would	1
not	1
speak	1
to	1
Anne	1
with	1
half	1
the	1
certainty	1
she	1
felt	1
on	1
the	1
subject,	1
she	1
would	1
venture	1
on	1
little	1
more	1
than	1
hints	1
of	1
what	1
might	1
be	1
hereafter,	1
of	1
a	1
possible	1
attachment	1
on	1
his	1
side,	1
of	1
the	1
desirableness	1
of	1
the	1
alliance,	1
supposing	1
such	1
attachment	1
to	1
be	1
real	1
and	1
returned.	1
Anne	1
heard	1
her,	1
and	1
made	1
no	1
violent	1
exclamations;	1
she	1
only	1
smiled,	1
blushed,	1
and	1
gently	1
shook	1
her	1
head.	1
"I	1
am	1
no	1
match-maker,	1
as	1
you	1
well	1
know,"	1
said	1
Lady	1
Russell,	1
"being	1
much	1
too	1
well	1
aware	1
of	1
the	1
uncertainty	1
of	1
all	1
human	1
events	1
and	1
calculations.	1
I	1
only	1
mean	1
that	1
if	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
should	1
some	1
time	1
hence	1
pay	1
his	1
addresses	1
to	1
you,	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
should	1
be	1
disposed	1
to	1
accept	1
him,	1
I	1
think	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
every	1
possibility	1
of	1
your	1
being	1
happy	1
together.	1
A	1
most	1
suitable	1
connection	1
everybody	1
must	1
consider	1
it,	1
but	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
a	1
very	1
happy	1
one."	1
"Mr	1
Elliot	1
is	1
an	1
exceedingly	1
agreeable	1
man,	1
and	1
in	1
many	1
respects	1
I	1
think	1
highly	1
of	1
him,"	1
said	1
Anne;	1
"but	1
we	1
should	1
not	1
suit."	1
Lady	1
Russell	1
let	1
this	1
pass,	1
and	1
only	1
said	1
in	1
rejoinder,	1
"I	1
own	1
that	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
regard	1
you	1
as	1
the	1
future	1
mistress	1
of	1
Kellynch,	1
the	1
future	1
Lady	1
Elliot,	1
to	1
look	1
forward	1
and	1
see	1
you	1
occupying	1
your	1
dear	1
mother's	1
place,	1
succeeding	1
to	1
all	1
her	1
rights,	1
and	1
all	1
her	1
popularity,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
to	1
all	1
her	1
virtues,	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
highest	1
possible	1
gratification	1
to	1
me.	1
You	1
are	1
your	1
mother's	1
self	1
in	1
countenance	1
and	1
disposition;	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
might	1
be	1
allowed	1
to	1
fancy	1
you	1
such	1
as	1
she	1
was,	1
in	1
situation	1
and	1
name,	1
and	1
home,	1
presiding	1
and	1
blessing	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
spot,	1
and	1
only	1
superior	1
to	1
her	1
in	1
being	1
more	1
highly	1
valued!	1
My	1
dearest	1
Anne,	1
it	1
would	1
give	1
me	1
more	1
delight	1
than	1
is	1
often	1
felt	1
at	1
my	1
time	1
of	1
life!"	1
Anne	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
turn	1
away,	1
to	1
rise,	1
to	1
walk	1
to	1
a	1
distant	1
table,	1
and,	1
leaning	1
there	1
in	1
pretended	1
employment,	1
try	1
to	1
subdue	1
the	1
feelings	1
this	1
picture	1
excited.	1
For	1
a	1
few	1
moments	1
her	1
imagination	1
and	1
her	1
heart	1
were	1
bewitched.	1
The	1
idea	1
of	1
becoming	1
what	1
her	1
mother	1
had	1
been;	1
of	1
having	1
the	1
precious	1
name	1
of	1
"Lady	1
Elliot"	1
first	1
revived	1
in	1
herself;	1
of	1
being	1
restored	1
to	1
Kellynch,	1
calling	1
it	1
her	1
home	1
again,	1
her	1
home	1
for	1
ever,	1
was	1
a	1
charm	1
which	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
immediately	1
resist.	1
Lady	1
Russell	1
said	1
not	1
another	1
word,	1
willing	1
to	1
leave	1
the	1
matter	1
to	1
its	1
own	1
operation;	1
and	1
believing	1
that,	1
could	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
with	1
propriety	1
have	1
spoken	1
for	1
himself!--she	1
believed,	1
in	1
short,	1
what	1
Anne	1
did	1
not	1
believe.	1
The	1
same	1
image	1
of	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
speaking	1
for	1
himself	1
brought	1
Anne	1
to	1
composure	1
again.	1
The	1
charm	1
of	1
Kellynch	1
and	1
of	1
"Lady	1
Elliot"	1
all	1
faded	1
away.	1
She	1
never	1
could	1
accept	1
him.	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
only	1
that	1
her	1
feelings	1
were	1
still	1
adverse	1
to	1
any	1
man	1
save	1
one;	1
her	1
judgement,	1
on	1
a	1
serious	1
consideration	1
of	1
the	1
possibilities	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
case	1
was	1
against	1
Mr	1
Elliot.	1
Though	1
they	1
had	1
now	1
been	1
acquainted	1
a	1
month,	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
satisfied	1
that	1
she	1
really	1
knew	1
his	1
character.	1
That	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
sensible	1
man,	1
an	1
agreeable	1
man,	1
that	1
he	1
talked	1
well,	1
professed	1
good	1
opinions,	1
seemed	1
to	1
judge	1
properly	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
principle,	1
this	1
was	1
all	1
clear	1
enough.	1
He	1
certainly	1
knew	1
what	1
was	1
right,	1
nor	1
could	1
she	1
fix	1
on	1
any	1
one	1
article	1
of	1
moral	1
duty	1
evidently	1
transgressed;	1
but	1
yet	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
afraid	1
to	1
answer	1
for	1
his	1
conduct.	1
She	1
distrusted	1
the	1
past,	1
if	1
not	1
the	1
present.	1
The	1
names	1
which	1
occasionally	1
dropt	1
of	1
former	1
associates,	1
the	1
allusions	1
to	1
former	1
practices	1
and	1
pursuits,	1
suggested	1
suspicions	1
not	1
favourable	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
been.	1
She	1
saw	1
that	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
bad	1
habits;	1
that	1
Sunday	1
travelling	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
common	1
thing;	1
that	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
period	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
(and	1
probably	1
not	1
a	1
short	1
one)	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
been,	1
at	1
least,	1
careless	1
in	1
all	1
serious	1
matters;	1
and,	1
though	1
he	1
might	1
now	1
think	1
very	1
differently,	1
who	1
could	1
answer	1
for	1
the	1
true	1
sentiments	1
of	1
a	1
clever,	1
cautious	1
man,	1
grown	1
old	1
enough	1
to	1
appreciate	1
a	1
fair	1
character?	1
How	1
could	1
it	1
ever	1
be	1
ascertained	1
that	1
his	1
mind	1
was	1
truly	1
cleansed?	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
was	1
rational,	1
discreet,	1
polished,	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
open.	1
There	1
was	1
never	1
any	1
burst	1
of	1
feeling,	1
any	1
warmth	1
of	1
indignation	1
or	1
delight,	1
at	1
the	1
evil	1
or	1
good	1
of	1
others.	1
This,	1
to	1
Anne,	1
was	1
a	1
decided	1
imperfection.	1
Her	1
early	1
impressions	1
were	1
incurable.	1
She	1
prized	1
the	1
frank,	1
the	1
open-hearted,	1
the	1
eager	1
character	1
beyond	1
all	1
others.	1
Warmth	1
and	1
enthusiasm	1
did	1
captivate	1
her	1
still.	1
She	1
felt	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
so	1
much	1
more	1
depend	1
upon	1
the	1
sincerity	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
sometimes	1
looked	1
or	1
said	1
a	1
careless	1
or	1
a	1
hasty	1
thing,	1
than	1
of	1
those	1
whose	1
presence	1
of	1
mind	1
never	1
varied,	1
whose	1
tongue	1
never	1
slipped.	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
was	1
too	1
generally	1
agreeable.	1
Various	1
as	1
were	1
the	1
tempers	1
in	1
her	1
father's	1
house,	1
he	1
pleased	1
them	1
all.	1
He	1
endured	1
too	1
well,	1
stood	1
too	1
well	1
with	1
every	1
body.	1
He	1
had	1
spoken	1
to	1
her	1
with	1
some	1
degree	1
of	1
openness	1
of	1
Mrs	1
Clay;	1
had	1
appeared	1
completely	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
Mrs	1
Clay	1
was	1
about,	1
and	1
to	1
hold	1
her	1
in	1
contempt;	1
and	1
yet	1
Mrs	1
Clay	1
found	1
him	1
as	1
agreeable	1
as	1
any	1
body.	1
Lady	1
Russell	1
saw	1
either	1
less	1
or	1
more	1
than	1
her	1
young	1
friend,	1
for	1
she	1
saw	1
nothing	1
to	1
excite	1
distrust.	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
imagine	1
a	1
man	1
more	1
exactly	1
what	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
than	1
Mr	1
Elliot;	1
nor	1
did	1
she	1
ever	1
enjoy	1
a	1
sweeter	1
feeling	1
than	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
seeing	1
him	1
receive	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
her	1
beloved	1
Anne	1
in	1
Kellynch	1
church,	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
the	1
following	1
autumn.	1
Chapter	1
18	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
February;	1
and	1
Anne,	1
having	1
been	1
a	1
month	1
in	1
Bath,	1
was	1
growing	1
very	1
eager	1
for	1
news	1
from	1
Uppercross	1
and	1
Lyme.	1
She	1
wanted	1
to	1
hear	1
much	1
more	1
than	1
Mary	1
had	1
communicated.	1
It	1
was	1
three	1
weeks	1
since	1
she	1
had	1
heard	1
at	1
all.	1
She	1
only	1
knew	1
that	1
Henrietta	1
was	1
at	1
home	1
again;	1
and	1
that	1
Louisa,	1
though	1
considered	1
to	1
be	1
recovering	1
fast,	1
was	1
still	1
in	1
Lyme;	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
thinking	1
of	1
them	1
all	1
very	1
intently	1
one	1
evening,	1
when	1
a	1
thicker	1
letter	1
than	1
usual	1
from	1
Mary	1
was	1
delivered	1
to	1
her;	1
and,	1
to	1
quicken	1
the	1
pleasure	1
and	1
surprise,	1
with	1
Admiral	1
and	1
Mrs	1
Croft's	1
compliments.	1
The	1
Crofts	1
must	1
be	1
in	1
Bath!	1
A	1
circumstance	1
to	1
interest	1
her.	1
They	1
were	1
people	1
whom	1
her	1
heart	1
turned	1
to	1
very	1
naturally.	1
"What	1
is	1
this?"	1
cried	1
Sir	1
Walter.	1
"The	1
Crofts	1
have	1
arrived	1
in	1
Bath?	1
The	1
Crofts	1
who	1
rent	1
Kellynch?	1
What	1
have	1
they	1
brought	1
you?"	1
"A	1
letter	1
from	1
Uppercross	1
Cottage,	1
Sir."	1
"Oh!	1
those	1
letters	1
are	1
convenient	1
passports.	1
They	1
secure	1
an	1
introduction.	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
visited	1
Admiral	1
Croft,	1
however,	1
at	1
any	1
rate.	1
I	1
know	1
what	1
is	1
due	1
to	1
my	1
tenant."	1
Anne	1
could	1
listen	1
no	1
longer;	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
even	1
have	1
told	1
how	1
the	1
poor	1
Admiral's	1
complexion	1
escaped;	1
her	1
letter	1
engrossed	1
her.	1
It	1
had	1
been	1
begun	1
several	1
days	1
back.	1
"February	1
1st.	1
"My	1
dear	1
Anne,--I	1
make	1
no	1
apology	1
for	1
my	1
silence,	1
because	1
I	1
know	1
how	1
little	1
people	1
think	1
of	1
letters	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
place	1
as	1
Bath.	1
You	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
too	1
happy	1
to	1
care	1
for	1
Uppercross,	1
which,	1
as	1
you	1
well	1
know,	1
affords	1
little	1
to	1
write	1
about.	1
We	1
have	1
had	1
a	1
very	1
dull	1
Christmas;	1
Mr	1
and	1
Mrs	1
Musgrove	1
have	1
not	1
had	1
one	1
dinner	1
party	1
all	1
the	1
holidays.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
reckon	1
the	1
Hayters	1
as	1
anybody.	1
The	1
holidays,	1
however,	1
are	1
over	1
at	1
last:	1
I	1
believe	1
no	1
children	1
ever	1
had	1
such	1
long	1
ones.	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
I	1
had	1
not.	1
The	1
house	1
was	1
cleared	1
yesterday,	1
except	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
Harvilles;	1
but	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
surprised	1
to	1
hear	1
they	1
have	1
never	1
gone	1
home.	1
Mrs	1
Harville	1
must	1
be	1
an	1
odd	1
mother	1
to	1
part	1
with	1
them	1
so	1
long.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
understand	1
it.	1
They	1
are	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
nice	1
children,	1
in	1
my	1
opinion;	1
but	1
Mrs	1
Musgrove	1
seems	1
to	1
like	1
them	1
quite	1
as	1
well,	1
if	1
not	1
better,	1
than	1
her	1
grandchildren.	1
What	1
dreadful	1
weather	1
we	1
have	1
had!	1
It	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
felt	1
in	1
Bath,	1
with	1
your	1
nice	1
pavements;	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
it	1
is	1
of	1
some	1
consequence.	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
had	1
a	1
creature	1
call	1
on	1
me	1
since	1
the	1
second	1
week	1
in	1
January,	1
except	1
Charles	1
Hayter,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
calling	1
much	1
oftener	1
than	1
was	1
welcome.	1
Between	1
ourselves,	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
a	1
great	1
pity	1
Henrietta	1
did	1
not	1
remain	1
at	1
Lyme	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
Louisa;	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
kept	1
her	1
a	1
little	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
way.	1
The	1
carriage	1
is	1
gone	1
to-day,	1
to	1
bring	1
Louisa	1
and	1
the	1
Harvilles	1
to-morrow.	1
We	1
are	1
not	1
asked	1
to	1
dine	1
with	1
them,	1
however,	1
till	1
the	1
day	1
after,	1
Mrs	1
Musgrove	1
is	1
so	1
afraid	1
of	1
her	1
being	1
fatigued	1
by	1
the	1
journey,	1
which	1
is	1
not	1
very	1
likely,	1
considering	1
the	1
care	1
that	1
will	1
be	1
taken	1
of	1
her;	1
and	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
much	1
more	1
convenient	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
dine	1
there	1
to-morrow.	1
I	1
am	1
glad	1
you	1
find	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
so	1
agreeable,	1
and	1
wish	1
I	1
could	1
be	1
acquainted	1
with	1
him	1
too;	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
my	1
usual	1
luck:	1
I	1
am	1
always	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way	1
when	1
any	1
thing	1
desirable	1
is	1
going	1
on;	1
always	1
the	1
last	1
of	1
my	1
family	1
to	1
be	1
noticed.	1
What	1
an	1
immense	1
time	1
Mrs	1
Clay	1
has	1
been	1
staying	1
with	1
Elizabeth!	1
Does	1
she	1
never	1
mean	1
to	1
go	1
away?	1
But	1
perhaps	1
if	1
she	1
were	1
to	1
leave	1
the	1
room	1
vacant,	1
we	1
might	1
not	1
be	1
invited.	1
Let	1
me	1
know	1
what	1
you	1
think	1
of	1
this.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
expect	1
my	1
children	1
to	1
be	1
asked,	1
you	1
know.	1
I	1
can	1
leave	1
them	1
at	1
the	1
Great	1
House	1
very	1
well,	1
for	1
a	1
month	1
or	1
six	1
weeks.	1
I	1
have	1
this	1
moment	1
heard	1
that	1
the	1
Crofts	1
are	1
going	1
to	1
Bath	1
almost	1
immediately;	1
they	1
think	1
the	1
Admiral	1
gouty.	1
Charles	1
heard	1
it	1
quite	1
by	1
chance;	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
had	1
the	1
civility	1
to	1
give	1
me	1
any	1
notice,	1
or	1
of	1
offering	1
to	1
take	1
anything.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
they	1
improve	1
at	1
all	1
as	1
neighbours.	1
We	1
see	1
nothing	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
really	1
an	1
instance	1
of	1
gross	1
inattention.	1
Charles	1
joins	1
me	1
in	1
love,	1
and	1
everything	1
proper.	1
Yours	1
affectionately,	1
"Mary	1
M---.	1
"I	1
am	1
sorry	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
far	1
from	1
well;	1
and	1
Jemima	1
has	1
just	1
told	1
me	1
that	1
the	1
butcher	1
says	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
bad	1
sore-throat	1
very	1
much	1
about.	1
I	1
dare	1
say	1
I	1
shall	1
catch	1
it;	1
and	1
my	1
sore-throats,	1
you	1
know,	1
are	1
always	1
worse	1
than	1
anybody's."	1
So	1
ended	1
the	1
first	1
part,	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
afterwards	1
put	1
into	1
an	1
envelope,	1
containing	1
nearly	1
as	1
much	1
more.	1
"I	1
kept	1
my	1
letter	1
open,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
send	1
you	1
word	1
how	1
Louisa	1
bore	1
her	1
journey,	1
and	1
now	1
I	1
am	1
extremely	1
glad	1
I	1
did,	1
having	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
to	1
add.	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
place,	1
I	1
had	1
a	1
note	1
from	1
Mrs	1
Croft	1
yesterday,	1
offering	1
to	1
convey	1
anything	1
to	1
you;	1
a	1
very	1
kind,	1
friendly	1
note	1
indeed,	1
addressed	1
to	1
me,	1
just	1
as	1
it	1
ought;	1
I	1
shall	1
therefore	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
make	1
my	1
letter	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
I	1
like.	1
The	1
Admiral	1
does	1
not	1
seem	1
very	1
ill,	1
and	1
I	1
sincerely	1
hope	1
Bath	1
will	1
do	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
good	1
he	1
wants.	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
truly	1
glad	1
to	1
have	1
them	1
back	1
again.	1
Our	1
neighbourhood	1
cannot	1
spare	1
such	1
a	1
pleasant	1
family.	1
But	1
now	1
for	1
Louisa.	1
I	1
have	1
something	1
to	1
communicate	1
that	1
will	1
astonish	1
you	1
not	1
a	1
little.	1
She	1
and	1
the	1
Harvilles	1
came	1
on	1
Tuesday	1
very	1
safely,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
we	1
went	1
to	1
ask	1
her	1
how	1
she	1
did,	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
rather	1
surprised	1
not	1
to	1
find	1
Captain	1
Benwick	1
of	1
the	1
party,	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
invited	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
Harvilles;	1
and	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
was	1
the	1
reason?	1
Neither	1
more	1
nor	1
less	1
than	1
his	1
being	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
Louisa,	1
and	1
not	1
choosing	1
to	1
venture	1
to	1
Uppercross	1
till	1
he	1
had	1
had	1
an	1
answer	1
from	1
Mr	1
Musgrove;	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
settled	1
between	1
him	1
and	1
her	1
before	1
she	1
came	1
away,	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
written	1
to	1
her	1
father	1
by	1
Captain	1
Harville.	1
True,	1
upon	1
my	1
honour!	1
Are	1
not	1
you	1
astonished?	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
surprised	1
at	1
least	1
if	1
you	1
ever	1
received	1
a	1
hint	1
of	1
it,	1
for	1
I	1
never	1
did.	1
Mrs	1
Musgrove	1
protests	1
solemnly	1
that	1
she	1
knew	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
matter.	1
We	1
are	1
all	1
very	1
well	1
pleased,	1
however,	1
for	1
though	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
equal	1
to	1
her	1
marrying	1
Captain	1
Wentworth,	1
it	1
is	1
infinitely	1
better	1
than	1
Charles	1
Hayter;	1
and	1
Mr	1
Musgrove	1
has	1
written	1
his	1
consent,	1
and	1
Captain	1
Benwick	1
is	1
expected	1
to-day.	1
Mrs	1
Harville	1
says	1
her	1
husband	1
feels	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
on	1
his	1
poor	1
sister's	1
account;	1
but,	1
however,	1
Louisa	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
favourite	1
with	1
both.	1
Indeed,	1
Mrs	1
Harville	1
and	1
I	1
quite	1
agree	1
that	1
we	1
love	1
her	1
the	1
better	1
for	1
having	1
nursed	1
her.	1
Charles	1
wonders	1
what	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
will	1
say;	1
but	1
if	1
you	1
remember,	1
I	1
never	1
thought	1
him	1
attached	1
to	1
Louisa;	1
I	1
never	1
could	1
see	1
anything	1
of	1
it.	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
end,	1
you	1
see,	1
of	1
Captain	1
Benwick's	1
being	1
supposed	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
admirer	1
of	1
yours.	1
How	1
Charles	1
could	1
take	1
such	1
a	1
thing	1
into	1
his	1
head	1
was	1
always	1
incomprehensible	1
to	1
me.	1
I	1
hope	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
more	1
agreeable	1
now.	1
Certainly	1
not	1
a	1
great	1
match	1
for	1
Louisa	1
Musgrove,	1
but	1
a	1
million	1
times	1
better	1
than	1
marrying	1
among	1
the	1
Hayters."	1
Mary	1
need	1
not	1
have	1
feared	1
her	1
sister's	1
being	1
in	1
any	1
degree	1
prepared	1
for	1
the	1
news.	1
She	1
had	1
never	1
in	1
her	1
life	1
been	1
more	1
astonished.	1
Captain	1
Benwick	1
and	1
Louisa	1
Musgrove!	1
It	1
was	1
almost	1
too	1
wonderful	1
for	1
belief,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
with	1
the	1
greatest	1
effort	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
remain	1
in	1
the	1
room,	1
preserve	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
calmness,	1
and	1
answer	1
the	1
common	1
questions	1
of	1
the	1
moment.	1
Happily	1
for	1
her,	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
many.	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
wanted	1
to	1
know	1
whether	1
the	1
Crofts	1
travelled	1
with	1
four	1
horses,	1
and	1
whether	1
they	1
were	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
situated	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
Bath	1
as	1
it	1
might	1
suit	1
Miss	1
Elliot	1
and	1
himself	1
to	1
visit	1
in;	1
but	1
had	1
little	1
curiosity	1
beyond.	1
"How	1
is	1
Mary?"	1
said	1
Elizabeth;	1
and	1
without	1
waiting	1
for	1
an	1
answer,	1
"And	1
pray	1
what	1
brings	1
the	1
Crofts	1
to	1
Bath?"	1
"They	1
come	1
on	1
the	1
Admiral's	1
account.	1
He	1
is	1
thought	1
to	1
be	1
gouty."	1
"Gout	1
and	1
decrepitude!"	1
said	1
Sir	1
Walter.	1
"Poor	1
old	1
gentleman."	1
"Have	1
they	1
any	1
acquaintance	1
here?"	1
asked	1
Elizabeth.	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
know;	1
but	1
I	1
can	1
hardly	1
suppose	1
that,	1
at	1
Admiral	1
Croft's	1
time	1
of	1
life,	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
profession,	1
he	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
many	1
acquaintance	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
place	1
as	1
this."	1
"I	1
suspect,"	1
said	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
coolly,	1
"that	1
Admiral	1
Croft	1
will	1
be	1
best	1
known	1
in	1
Bath	1
as	1
the	1
renter	1
of	1
Kellynch	1
Hall.	1
Elizabeth,	1
may	1
we	1
venture	1
to	1
present	1
him	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
in	1
Laura	1
Place?"	1
"Oh,	1
no!	1
I	1
think	1
not.	1
Situated	1
as	1
we	1
are	1
with	1
Lady	1
Dalrymple,	1
cousins,	1
we	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
very	1
careful	1
not	1
to	1
embarrass	1
her	1
with	1
acquaintance	1
she	1
might	1
not	1
approve.	1
If	1
we	1
were	1
not	1
related,	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
signify;	1
but	1
as	1
cousins,	1
she	1
would	1
feel	1
scrupulous	1
as	1
to	1
any	1
proposal	1
of	1
ours.	1
We	1
had	1
better	1
leave	1
the	1
Crofts	1
to	1
find	1
their	1
own	1
level.	1
There	1
are	1
several	1
odd-looking	1
men	1
walking	1
about	1
here,	1
who,	1
I	1
am	1
told,	1
are	1
sailors.	1
The	1
Crofts	1
will	1
associate	1
with	1
them."	1
This	1
was	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
and	1
Elizabeth's	1
share	1
of	1
interest	1
in	1
the	1
letter;	1
when	1
Mrs	1
Clay	1
had	1
paid	1
her	1
tribute	1
of	1
more	1
decent	1
attention,	1
in	1
an	1
enquiry	1
after	1
Mrs	1
Charles	1
Musgrove,	1
and	1
her	1
fine	1
little	1
boys,	1
Anne	1
was	1
at	1
liberty.	1
In	1
her	1
own	1
room,	1
she	1
tried	1
to	1
comprehend	1
it.	1
Well	1
might	1
Charles	1
wonder	1
how	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
would	1
feel!	1
Perhaps	1
he	1
had	1
quitted	1
the	1
field,	1
had	1
given	1
Louisa	1
up,	1
had	1
ceased	1
to	1
love,	1
had	1
found	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
love	1
her.	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
endure	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
treachery	1
or	1
levity,	1
or	1
anything	1
akin	1
to	1
ill	1
usage	1
between	1
him	1
and	1
his	1
friend.	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
endure	1
that	1
such	1
a	1
friendship	1
as	1
theirs	1
should	1
be	1
severed	1
unfairly.	1
Captain	1
Benwick	1
and	1
Louisa	1
Musgrove!	1
The	1
high-spirited,	1
joyous-talking	1
Louisa	1
Musgrove,	1
and	1
the	1
dejected,	1
thinking,	1
feeling,	1
reading,	1
Captain	1
Benwick,	1
seemed	1
each	1
of	1
them	1
everything	1
that	1
would	1
not	1
suit	1
the	1
other.	1
Their	1
minds	1
most	1
dissimilar!	1
Where	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
attraction?	1
The	1
answer	1
soon	1
presented	1
itself.	1
It	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
situation.	1
They	1
had	1
been	1
thrown	1
together	1
several	1
weeks;	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
living	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
small	1
family	1
party:	1
since	1
Henrietta's	1
coming	1
away,	1
they	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
depending	1
almost	1
entirely	1
on	1
each	1
other,	1
and	1
Louisa,	1
just	1
recovering	1
from	1
illness,	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
an	1
interesting	1
state,	1
and	1
Captain	1
Benwick	1
was	1
not	1
inconsolable.	1
That	1
was	1
a	1
point	1
which	1
Anne	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
avoid	1
suspecting	1
before;	1
and	1
instead	1
of	1
drawing	1
the	1
same	1
conclusion	1
as	1
Mary,	1
from	1
the	1
present	1
course	1
of	1
events,	1
they	1
served	1
only	1
to	1
confirm	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
his	1
having	1
felt	1
some	1
dawning	1
of	1
tenderness	1
toward	1
herself.	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
mean,	1
however,	1
to	1
derive	1
much	1
more	1
from	1
it	1
to	1
gratify	1
her	1
vanity,	1
than	1
Mary	1
might	1
have	1
allowed.	1
She	1
was	1
persuaded	1
that	1
any	1
tolerably	1
pleasing	1
young	1
woman	1
who	1
had	1
listened	1
and	1
seemed	1
to	1
feel	1
for	1
him	1
would	1
have	1
received	1
the	1
same	1
compliment.	1
He	1
had	1
an	1
affectionate	1
heart.	1
He	1
must	1
love	1
somebody.	1
She	1
saw	1
no	1
reason	1
against	1
their	1
being	1
happy.	1
Louisa	1
had	1
fine	1
naval	1
fervour	1
to	1
begin	1
with,	1
and	1
they	1
would	1
soon	1
grow	1
more	1
alike.	1
He	1
would	1
gain	1
cheerfulness,	1
and	1
she	1
would	1
learn	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
enthusiast	1
for	1
Scott	1
and	1
Lord	1
Byron;	1
nay,	1
that	1
was	1
probably	1
learnt	1
already;	1
of	1
course	1
they	1
had	1
fallen	1
in	1
love	1
over	1
poetry.	1
The	1
idea	1
of	1
Louisa	1
Musgrove	1
turned	1
into	1
a	1
person	1
of	1
literary	1
taste,	1
and	1
sentimental	1
reflection	1
was	1
amusing,	1
but	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
doubt	1
of	1
its	1
being	1
so.	1
The	1
day	1
at	1
Lyme,	1
the	1
fall	1
from	1
the	1
Cobb,	1
might	1
influence	1
her	1
health,	1
her	1
nerves,	1
her	1
courage,	1
her	1
character	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
her	1
life,	1
as	1
thoroughly	1
as	1
it	1
appeared	1
to	1
have	1
influenced	1
her	1
fate.	1
The	1
conclusion	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
was,	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
woman	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
sensible	1
of	1
Captain	1
Wentworth's	1
merits	1
could	1
be	1
allowed	1
to	1
prefer	1
another	1
man,	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
in	1
the	1
engagement	1
to	1
excite	1
lasting	1
wonder;	1
and	1
if	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
lost	1
no	1
friend	1
by	1
it,	1
certainly	1
nothing	1
to	1
be	1
regretted.	1
No,	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
regret	1
which	1
made	1
Anne's	1
heart	1
beat	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
herself,	1
and	1
brought	1
the	1
colour	1
into	1
her	1
cheeks	1
when	1
she	1
thought	1
of	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
unshackled	1
and	1
free.	1
She	1
had	1
some	1
feelings	1
which	1
she	1
was	1
ashamed	1
to	1
investigate.	1
They	1
were	1
too	1
much	1
like	1
joy,	1
senseless	1
joy!	1
She	1
longed	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
Crofts;	1
but	1
when	1
the	1
meeting	1
took	1
place,	1
it	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
no	1
rumour	1
of	1
the	1
news	1
had	1
yet	1
reached	1
them.	1
The	1
visit	1
of	1
ceremony	1
was	1
paid	1
and	1
returned;	1
and	1
Louisa	1
Musgrove	1
was	1
mentioned,	1
and	1
Captain	1
Benwick,	1
too,	1
without	1
even	1
half	1
a	1
smile.	1
The	1
Crofts	1
had	1
placed	1
themselves	1
in	1
lodgings	1
in	1
Gay	1
Street,	1
perfectly	1
to	1
Sir	1
Walter's	1
satisfaction.	1
He	1
was	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
ashamed	1
of	1
the	1
acquaintance,	1
and	1
did,	1
in	1
fact,	1
think	1
and	1
talk	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
more	1
about	1
the	1
Admiral,	1
than	1
the	1
Admiral	1
ever	1
thought	1
or	1
talked	1
about	1
him.	1
The	1
Crofts	1
knew	1
quite	1
as	1
many	1
people	1
in	1
Bath	1
as	1
they	1
wished	1
for,	1
and	1
considered	1
their	1
intercourse	1
with	1
the	1
Elliots	1
as	1
a	1
mere	1
matter	1
of	1
form,	1
and	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
likely	1
to	1
afford	1
them	1
any	1
pleasure.	1
They	1
brought	1
with	1
them	1
their	1
country	1
habit	1
of	1
being	1
almost	1
always	1
together.	1
He	1
was	1
ordered	1
to	1
walk	1
to	1
keep	1
off	1
the	1
gout,	1
and	1
Mrs	1
Croft	1
seemed	1
to	1
go	1
shares	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
everything,	1
and	1
to	1
walk	1
for	1
her	1
life	1
to	1
do	1
him	1
good.	1
Anne	1
saw	1
them	1
wherever	1
she	1
went.	1
Lady	1
Russell	1
took	1
her	1
out	1
in	1
her	1
carriage	1
almost	1
every	1
morning,	1
and	1
she	1
never	1
failed	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
never	1
failed	1
to	1
see	1
them.	1
Knowing	1
their	1
feelings	1
as	1
she	1
did,	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
most	1
attractive	1
picture	1
of	1
happiness	1
to	1
her.	1
She	1
always	1
watched	1
them	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
she	1
could,	1
delighted	1
to	1
fancy	1
she	1
understood	1
what	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
talking	1
of,	1
as	1
they	1
walked	1
along	1
in	1
happy	1
independence,	1
or	1
equally	1
delighted	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
Admiral's	1
hearty	1
shake	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
when	1
he	1
encountered	1
an	1
old	1
friend,	1
and	1
observe	1
their	1
eagerness	1
of	1
conversation	1
when	1
occasionally	1
forming	1
into	1
a	1
little	1
knot	1
of	1
the	1
navy,	1
Mrs	1
Croft	1
looking	1
as	1
intelligent	1
and	1
keen	1
as	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
officers	1
around	1
her.	1
Anne	1
was	1
too	1
much	1
engaged	1
with	1
Lady	1
Russell	1
to	1
be	1
often	1
walking	1
herself;	1
but	1
it	1
so	1
happened	1
that	1
one	1
morning,	1
about	1
a	1
week	1
or	1
ten	1
days	1
after	1
the	1
Croft's	1
arrival,	1
it	1
suited	1
her	1
best	1
to	1
leave	1
her	1
friend,	1
or	1
her	1
friend's	1
carriage,	1
in	1
the	1
lower	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
town,	1
and	1
return	1
alone	1
to	1
Camden	1
Place,	1
and	1
in	1
walking	1
up	1
Milsom	1
Street	1
she	1
had	1
the	1
good	1
fortune	1
to	1
meet	1
with	1
the	1
Admiral.	1
He	1
was	1
standing	1
by	1
himself	1
at	1
a	1
printshop	1
window,	1
with	1
his	1
hands	1
behind	1
him,	1
in	1
earnest	1
contemplation	1
of	1
some	1
print,	1
and	1
she	1
not	1
only	1
might	1
have	1
passed	1
him	1
unseen,	1
but	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
touch	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
address	1
him	1
before	1
she	1
could	1
catch	1
his	1
notice.	1
When	1
he	1
did	1
perceive	1
and	1
acknowledge	1
her,	1
however,	1
it	1
was	1
done	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
usual	1
frankness	1
and	1
good	1
humour.	1
"Ha!	1
is	1
it	1
you?	1
Thank	1
you,	1
thank	1
you.	1
This	1
is	1
treating	1
me	1
like	1
a	1
friend.	1
Here	1
I	1
am,	1
you	1
see,	1
staring	1
at	1
a	1
picture.	1
I	1
can	1
never	1
get	1
by	1
this	1
shop	1
without	1
stopping.	1
But	1
what	1
a	1
thing	1
here	1
is,	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
a	1
boat!	1
Do	1
look	1
at	1
it.	1
Did	1
you	1
ever	1
see	1
the	1
like?	1
What	1
queer	1
fellows	1
your	1
fine	1
painters	1
must	1
be,	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
anybody	1
would	1
venture	1
their	1
lives	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
shapeless	1
old	1
cockleshell	1
as	1
that?	1
And	1
yet	1
here	1
are	1
two	1
gentlemen	1
stuck	1
up	1
in	1
it	1
mightily	1
at	1
their	1
ease,	1
and	1
looking	1
about	1
them	1
at	1
the	1
rocks	1
and	1
mountains,	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
upset	1
the	1
next	1
moment,	1
which	1
they	1
certainly	1
must	1
be.	1
I	1
wonder	1
where	1
that	1
boat	1
was	1
built!"	1
(laughing	1
heartily);	1
"I	1
would	1
not	1
venture	1
over	1
a	1
horsepond	1
in	1
it.	1
Well,"	1
(turning	1
away),	1
"now,	1
where	1
are	1
you	1
bound?	1
Can	1
I	1
go	1
anywhere	1
for	1
you,	1
or	1
with	1
you?	1
Can	1
I	1
be	1
of	1
any	1
use?"	1
"None,	1
I	1
thank	1
you,	1
unless	1
you	1
will	1
give	1
me	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
your	1
company	1
the	1
little	1
way	1
our	1
road	1
lies	1
together.	1
I	1
am	1
going	1
home."	1
"That	1
I	1
will,	1
with	1
all	1
my	1
heart,	1
and	1
farther,	1
too.	1
Yes,	1
yes	1
we	1
will	1
have	1
a	1
snug	1
walk	1
together,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
something	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
as	1
we	1
go	1
along.	1
There,	1
take	1
my	1
arm;	1
that's	1
right;	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
feel	1
comfortable	1
if	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
a	1
woman	1
there.	1
Lord!	1
what	1
a	1
boat	1
it	1
is!"	1
taking	1
a	1
last	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
picture,	1
as	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
motion.	1
"Did	1
you	1
say	1
that	1
you	1
had	1
something	1
to	1
tell	1
me,	1
sir?"	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
have,	1
presently.	1
But	1
here	1
comes	1
a	1
friend,	1
Captain	1
Brigden;	1
I	1
shall	1
only	1
say,	1
`How	1
d'ye	1
do?'	1
as	1
we	1
pass,	1
however.	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
stop.	1
`How	1
d'ye	1
do?'	1
Brigden	1
stares	1
to	1
see	1
anybody	1
with	1
me	1
but	1
my	1
wife.	1
She,	1
poor	1
soul,	1
is	1
tied	1
by	1
the	1
leg.	1
She	1
has	1
a	1
blister	1
on	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
heels,	1
as	1
large	1
as	1
a	1
three-shilling	1
piece.	1
If	1
you	1
look	1
across	1
the	1
street,	1
you	1
will	1
see	1
Admiral	1
Brand	1
coming	1
down	1
and	1
his	1
brother.	1
Shabby	1
fellows,	1
both	1
of	1
them!	1
I	1
am	1
glad	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
on	1
this	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
way.	1
Sophy	1
cannot	1
bear	1
them.	1
They	1
played	1
me	1
a	1
pitiful	1
trick	1
once:	1
got	1
away	1
with	1
some	1
of	1
my	1
best	1
men.	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
you	1
the	1
whole	1
story	1
another	1
time.	1
There	1
comes	1
old	1
Sir	1
Archibald	1
Drew	1
and	1
his	1
grandson.	1
Look,	1
he	1
sees	1
us;	1
he	1
kisses	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
you;	1
he	1
takes	1
you	1
for	1
my	1
wife.	1
Ah!	1
the	1
peace	1
has	1
come	1
too	1
soon	1
for	1
that	1
younker.	1
Poor	1
old	1
Sir	1
Archibald!	1
How	1
do	1
you	1
like	1
Bath,	1
Miss	1
Elliot?	1
It	1
suits	1
us	1
very	1
well.	1
We	1
are	1
always	1
meeting	1
with	1
some	1
old	1
friend	1
or	1
other;	1
the	1
streets	1
full	1
of	1
them	1
every	1
morning;	1
sure	1
to	1
have	1
plenty	1
of	1
chat;	1
and	1
then	1
we	1
get	1
away	1
from	1
them	1
all,	1
and	1
shut	1
ourselves	1
in	1
our	1
lodgings,	1
and	1
draw	1
in	1
our	1
chairs,	1
and	1
are	1
snug	1
as	1
if	1
we	1
were	1
at	1
Kellynch,	1
ay,	1
or	1
as	1
we	1
used	1
to	1
be	1
even	1
at	1
North	1
Yarmouth	1
and	1
Deal.	1
We	1
do	1
not	1
like	1
our	1
lodgings	1
here	1
the	1
worse,	1
I	1
can	1
tell	1
you,	1
for	1
putting	1
us	1
in	1
mind	1
of	1
those	1
we	1
first	1
had	1
at	1
North	1
Yarmouth.	1
The	1
wind	1
blows	1
through	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
cupboards	1
just	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way."	1
When	1
they	1
were	1
got	1
a	1
little	1
farther,	1
Anne	1
ventured	1
to	1
press	1
again	1
for	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
communicate.	1
She	1
hoped	1
when	1
clear	1
of	1
Milsom	1
Street	1
to	1
have	1
her	1
curiosity	1
gratified;	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
still	1
obliged	1
to	1
wait,	1
for	1
the	1
Admiral	1
had	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
not	1
to	1
begin	1
till	1
they	1
had	1
gained	1
the	1
greater	1
space	1
and	1
quiet	1
of	1
Belmont;	1
and	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
really	1
Mrs	1
Croft,	1
she	1
must	1
let	1
him	1
have	1
his	1
own	1
way.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
fairly	1
ascending	1
Belmont,	1
he	1
began--	1
"Well,	1
now	1
you	1
shall	1
hear	1
something	1
that	1
will	1
surprise	1
you.	1
But	1
first	1
of	1
all,	1
you	1
must	1
tell	1
me	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
lady	1
I	1
am	1
going	1
to	1
talk	1
about.	1
That	1
young	1
lady,	1
you	1
know,	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
all	1
been	1
so	1
concerned	1
for.	1
The	1
Miss	1
Musgrove,	1
that	1
all	1
this	1
has	1
been	1
happening	1
to.	1
Her	1
Christian	1
name:	1
I	1
always	1
forget	1
her	1
Christian	1
name."	1
Anne	1
had	1
been	1
ashamed	1
to	1
appear	1
to	1
comprehend	1
so	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
really	1
did;	1
but	1
now	1
she	1
could	1
safely	1
suggest	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
"Louisa."	1
"Ay,	1
ay,	1
Miss	1
Louisa	1
Musgrove,	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
name.	1
I	1
wish	1
young	1
ladies	1
had	1
not	1
such	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
fine	1
Christian	1
names.	1
I	1
should	1
never	1
be	1
out	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
Sophys,	1
or	1
something	1
of	1
that	1
sort.	1
Well,	1
this	1
Miss	1
Louisa,	1
we	1
all	1
thought,	1
you	1
know,	1
was	1
to	1
marry	1
Frederick.	1
He	1
was	1
courting	1
her	1
week	1
after	1
week.	1
The	1
only	1
wonder	1
was,	1
what	1
they	1
could	1
be	1
waiting	1
for,	1
till	1
the	1
business	1
at	1
Lyme	1
came;	1
then,	1
indeed,	1
it	1
was	1
clear	1
enough	1
that	1
they	1
must	1
wait	1
till	1
her	1
brain	1
was	1
set	1
to	1
right.	1
But	1
even	1
then	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
odd	1
in	1
their	1
way	1
of	1
going	1
on.	1
Instead	1
of	1
staying	1
at	1
Lyme,	1
he	1
went	1
off	1
to	1
Plymouth,	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
went	1
off	1
to	1
see	1
Edward.	1
When	1
we	1
came	1
back	1
from	1
Minehead	1
he	1
was	1
gone	1
down	1
to	1
Edward's,	1
and	1
there	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
ever	1
since.	1
We	1
have	1
seen	1
nothing	1
of	1
him	1
since	1
November.	1
Even	1
Sophy	1
could	1
not	1
understand	1
it.	1
But	1
now,	1
the	1
matter	1
has	1
take	1
the	1
strangest	1
turn	1
of	1
all;	1
for	1
this	1
young	1
lady,	1
the	1
same	1
Miss	1
Musgrove,	1
instead	1
of	1
being	1
to	1
marry	1
Frederick,	1
is	1
to	1
marry	1
James	1
Benwick.	1
You	1
know	1
James	1
Benwick."	1
"A	1
little.	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
little	1
acquainted	1
with	1
Captain	1
Benwick."	1
"Well,	1
she	1
is	1
to	1
marry	1
him.	1
Nay,	1
most	1
likely	1
they	1
are	1
married	1
already,	1
for	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
they	1
should	1
wait	1
for."	1
"I	1
thought	1
Captain	1
Benwick	1
a	1
very	1
pleasing	1
young	1
man,"	1
said	1
Anne,	1
"and	1
I	1
understand	1
that	1
he	1
bears	1
an	1
excellent	1
character."	1
"Oh!	1
yes,	1
yes,	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
word	1
to	1
be	1
said	1
against	1
James	1
Benwick.	1
He	1
is	1
only	1
a	1
commander,	1
it	1
is	1
true,	1
made	1
last	1
summer,	1
and	1
these	1
are	1
bad	1
times	1
for	1
getting	1
on,	1
but	1
he	1
has	1
not	1
another	1
fault	1
that	1
I	1
know	1
of.	1
An	1
excellent,	1
good-hearted	1
fellow,	1
I	1
assure	1
you;	1
a	1
very	1
active,	1
zealous	1
officer	1
too,	1
which	1
is	1
more	1
than	1
you	1
would	1
think	1
for,	1
perhaps,	1
for	1
that	1
soft	1
sort	1
of	1
manner	1
does	1
not	1
do	1
him	1
justice."	1
"Indeed	1
you	1
are	1
mistaken	1
there,	1
sir;	1
I	1
should	1
never	1
augur	1
want	1
of	1
spirit	1
from	1
Captain	1
Benwick's	1
manners.	1
I	1
thought	1
them	1
particularly	1
pleasing,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
answer	1
for	1
it,	1
they	1
would	1
generally	1
please."	1
"Well,	1
well,	1
ladies	1
are	1
the	1
best	1
judges;	1
but	1
James	1
Benwick	1
is	1
rather	1
too	1
piano	1
for	1
me;	1
and	1
though	1
very	1
likely	1
it	1
is	1
all	1
our	1
partiality,	1
Sophy	1
and	1
I	1
cannot	1
help	1
thinking	1
Frederick's	1
manners	1
better	1
than	1
his.	1
There	1
is	1
something	1
about	1
Frederick	1
more	1
to	1
our	1
taste."	1
Anne	1
was	1
caught.	1
She	1
had	1
only	1
meant	1
to	1
oppose	1
the	1
too	1
common	1
idea	1
of	1
spirit	1
and	1
gentleness	1
being	1
incompatible	1
with	1
each	1
other,	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
to	1
represent	1
Captain	1
Benwick's	1
manners	1
as	1
the	1
very	1
best	1
that	1
could	1
possibly	1
be;	1
and,	1
after	1
a	1
little	1
hesitation,	1
she	1
was	1
beginning	1
to	1
say,	1
"I	1
was	1
not	1
entering	1
into	1
any	1
comparison	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
friends,"	1
but	1
the	1
Admiral	1
interrupted	1
her	1
with--	1
"And	1
the	1
thing	1
is	1
certainly	1
true.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
mere	1
bit	1
of	1
gossip.	1
We	1
have	1
it	1
from	1
Frederick	1
himself.	1
His	1
sister	1
had	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
him	1
yesterday,	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
tells	1
us	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
just	1
had	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
Harville,	1
written	1
upon	1
the	1
spot,	1
from	1
Uppercross.	1
I	1
fancy	1
they	1
are	1
all	1
at	1
Uppercross."	1
This	1
was	1
an	1
opportunity	1
which	1
Anne	1
could	1
not	1
resist;	1
she	1
said,	1
therefore,	1
"I	1
hope,	1
Admiral,	1
I	1
hope	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
in	1
the	1
style	1
of	1
Captain	1
Wentworth's	1
letter	1
to	1
make	1
you	1
and	1
Mrs	1
Croft	1
particularly	1
uneasy.	1
It	1
did	1
seem,	1
last	1
autumn,	1
as	1
if	1
there	1
were	1
an	1
attachment	1
between	1
him	1
and	1
Louisa	1
Musgrove;	1
but	1
I	1
hope	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
understood	1
to	1
have	1
worn	1
out	1
on	1
each	1
side	1
equally,	1
and	1
without	1
violence.	1
I	1
hope	1
his	1
letter	1
does	1
not	1
breathe	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
an	1
ill-used	1
man."	1
"Not	1
at	1
all,	1
not	1
at	1
all;	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
an	1
oath	1
or	1
a	1
murmur	1
from	1
beginning	1
to	1
end."	1
Anne	1
looked	1
down	1
to	1
hide	1
her	1
smile.	1
"No,	1
no;	1
Frederick	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
man	1
to	1
whine	1
and	1
complain;	1
he	1
has	1
too	1
much	1
spirit	1
for	1
that.	1
If	1
the	1
girl	1
likes	1
another	1
man	1
better,	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
fit	1
she	1
should	1
have	1
him."	1
"Certainly.	1
But	1
what	1
I	1
mean	1
is,	1
that	1
I	1
hope	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
in	1
Captain	1
Wentworth's	1
manner	1
of	1
writing	1
to	1
make	1
you	1
suppose	1
he	1
thinks	1
himself	1
ill-used	1
by	1
his	1
friend,	1
which	1
might	1
appear,	1
you	1
know,	1
without	1
its	1
being	1
absolutely	1
said.	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
very	1
sorry	1
that	1
such	1
a	1
friendship	1
as	1
has	1
subsisted	1
between	1
him	1
and	1
Captain	1
Benwick	1
should	1
be	1
destroyed,	1
or	1
even	1
wounded,	1
by	1
a	1
circumstance	1
of	1
this	1
sort."	1
"Yes,	1
yes,	1
I	1
understand	1
you.	1
But	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
at	1
all	1
of	1
that	1
nature	1
in	1
the	1
letter.	1
He	1
does	1
not	1
give	1
the	1
least	1
fling	1
at	1
Benwick;	1
does	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
say,	1
`I	1
wonder	1
at	1
it,	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
reason	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
for	1
wondering	1
at	1
it.'	1
No,	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
guess,	1
from	1
his	1
way	1
of	1
writing,	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
ever	1
thought	1
of	1
this	1
Miss	1
(what's	1
her	1
name?)	1
for	1
himself.	1
He	1
very	1
handsomely	1
hopes	1
they	1
will	1
be	1
happy	1
together;	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
very	1
unforgiving	1
in	1
that,	1
I	1
think."	1
Anne	1
did	1
not	1
receive	1
the	1
perfect	1
conviction	1
which	1
the	1
Admiral	1
meant	1
to	1
convey,	1
but	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
useless	1
to	1
press	1
the	1
enquiry	1
farther.	1
She	1
therefore	1
satisfied	1
herself	1
with	1
common-place	1
remarks	1
or	1
quiet	1
attention,	1
and	1
the	1
Admiral	1
had	1
it	1
all	1
his	1
own	1
way.	1
"Poor	1
Frederick!"	1
said	1
he	1
at	1
last.	1
"Now	1
he	1
must	1
begin	1
all	1
over	1
again	1
with	1
somebody	1
else.	1
I	1
think	1
we	1
must	1
get	1
him	1
to	1
Bath.	1
Sophy	1
must	1
write,	1
and	1
beg	1
him	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
Bath.	1
Here	1
are	1
pretty	1
girls	1
enough,	1
I	1
am	1
sure.	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
of	1
no	1
use	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
Uppercross	1
again,	1
for	1
that	1
other	1
Miss	1
Musgrove,	1
I	1
find,	1
is	1
bespoke	1
by	1
her	1
cousin,	1
the	1
young	1
parson.	1
Do	1
not	1
you	1
think,	1
Miss	1
Elliot,	1
we	1
had	1
better	1
try	1
to	1
get	1
him	1
to	1
Bath?"	1
Chapter	1
19	1
While	1
Admiral	1
Croft	1
was	1
taking	1
this	1
walk	1
with	1
Anne,	1
and	1
expressing	1
his	1
wish	1
of	1
getting	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
to	1
Bath,	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
was	1
already	1
on	1
his	1
way	1
thither.	1
Before	1
Mrs	1
Croft	1
had	1
written,	1
he	1
was	1
arrived,	1
and	1
the	1
very	1
next	1
time	1
Anne	1
walked	1
out,	1
she	1
saw	1
him.	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
was	1
attending	1
his	1
two	1
cousins	1
and	1
Mrs	1
Clay.	1
They	1
were	1
in	1
Milsom	1
Street.	1
It	1
began	1
to	1
rain,	1
not	1
much,	1
but	1
enough	1
to	1
make	1
shelter	1
desirable	1
for	1
women,	1
and	1
quite	1
enough	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
very	1
desirable	1
for	1
Miss	1
Elliot	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
advantage	1
of	1
being	1
conveyed	1
home	1
in	1
Lady	1
Dalrymple's	1
carriage,	1
which	1
was	1
seen	1
waiting	1
at	1
a	1
little	1
distance;	1
she,	1
Anne,	1
and	1
Mrs	1
Clay,	1
therefore,	1
turned	1
into	1
Molland's,	1
while	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
stepped	1
to	1
Lady	1
Dalrymple,	1
to	1
request	1
her	1
assistance.	1
He	1
soon	1
joined	1
them	1
again,	1
successful,	1
of	1
course;	1
Lady	1
Dalrymple	1
would	1
be	1
most	1
happy	1
to	1
take	1
them	1
home,	1
and	1
would	1
call	1
for	1
them	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
minutes.	1
Her	1
ladyship's	1
carriage	1
was	1
a	1
barouche,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
hold	1
more	1
than	1
four	1
with	1
any	1
comfort.	1
Miss	1
Carteret	1
was	1
with	1
her	1
mother;	1
consequently	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
reasonable	1
to	1
expect	1
accommodation	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
three	1
Camden	1
Place	1
ladies.	1
There	1
could	1
be	1
no	1
doubt	1
as	1
to	1
Miss	1
Elliot.	1
Whoever	1
suffered	1
inconvenience,	1
she	1
must	1
suffer	1
none,	1
but	1
it	1
occupied	1
a	1
little	1
time	1
to	1
settle	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
civility	1
between	1
the	1
other	1
two.	1
The	1
rain	1
was	1
a	1
mere	1
trifle,	1
and	1
Anne	1
was	1
most	1
sincere	1
in	1
preferring	1
a	1
walk	1
with	1
Mr	1
Elliot.	1
But	1
the	1
rain	1
was	1
also	1
a	1
mere	1
trifle	1
to	1
Mrs	1
Clay;	1
she	1
would	1
hardly	1
allow	1
it	1
even	1
to	1
drop	1
at	1
all,	1
and	1
her	1
boots	1
were	1
so	1
thick!	1
much	1
thicker	1
than	1
Miss	1
Anne's;	1
and,	1
in	1
short,	1
her	1
civility	1
rendered	1
her	1
quite	1
as	1
anxious	1
to	1
be	1
left	1
to	1
walk	1
with	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
as	1
Anne	1
could	1
be,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
discussed	1
between	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
generosity	1
so	1
polite	1
and	1
so	1
determined,	1
that	1
the	1
others	1
were	1
obliged	1
to	1
settle	1
it	1
for	1
them;	1
Miss	1
Elliot	1
maintaining	1
that	1
Mrs	1
Clay	1
had	1
a	1
little	1
cold	1
already,	1
and	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
deciding	1
on	1
appeal,	1
that	1
his	1
cousin	1
Anne's	1
boots	1
were	1
rather	1
the	1
thickest.	1
It	1
was	1
fixed	1
accordingly,	1
that	1
Mrs	1
Clay	1
should	1
be	1
of	1
the	1
party	1
in	1
the	1
carriage;	1
and	1
they	1
had	1
just	1
reached	1
this	1
point,	1
when	1
Anne,	1
as	1
she	1
sat	1
near	1
the	1
window,	1
descried,	1
most	1
decidedly	1
and	1
distinctly,	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
walking	1
down	1
the	1
street.	1
Her	1
start	1
was	1
perceptible	1
only	1
to	1
herself;	1
but	1
she	1
instantly	1
felt	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
the	1
greatest	1
simpleton	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
the	1
most	1
unaccountable	1
and	1
absurd!	1
For	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
she	1
saw	1
nothing	1
before	1
her;	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
confusion.	1
She	1
was	1
lost,	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
scolded	1
back	1
her	1
senses,	1
she	1
found	1
the	1
others	1
still	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
carriage,	1
and	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
(always	1
obliging)	1
just	1
setting	1
off	1
for	1
Union	1
Street	1
on	1
a	1
commission	1
of	1
Mrs	1
Clay's.	1
She	1
now	1
felt	1
a	1
great	1
inclination	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
outer	1
door;	1
she	1
wanted	1
to	1
see	1
if	1
it	1
rained.	1
Why	1
was	1
she	1
to	1
suspect	1
herself	1
of	1
another	1
motive?	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
must	1
be	1
out	1
of	1
sight.	1
She	1
left	1
her	1
seat,	1
she	1
would	1
go;	1
one	1
half	1
of	1
her	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
always	1
so	1
much	1
wiser	1
than	1
the	1
other	1
half,	1
or	1
always	1
suspecting	1
the	1
other	1
of	1
being	1
worse	1
than	1
it	1
was.	1
She	1
would	1
see	1
if	1
it	1
rained.	1
She	1
was	1
sent	1
back,	1
however,	1
in	1
a	1
moment	1
by	1
the	1
entrance	1
of	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
himself,	1
among	1
a	1
party	1
of	1
gentlemen	1
and	1
ladies,	1
evidently	1
his	1
acquaintance,	1
and	1
whom	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
joined	1
a	1
little	1
below	1
Milsom	1
Street.	1
He	1
was	1
more	1
obviously	1
struck	1
and	1
confused	1
by	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
her	1
than	1
she	1
had	1
ever	1
observed	1
before;	1
he	1
looked	1
quite	1
red.	1
For	1
the	1
first	1
time,	1
since	1
their	1
renewed	1
acquaintance,	1
she	1
felt	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
betraying	1
the	1
least	1
sensibility	1
of	1
the	1
two.	1
She	1
had	1
the	1
advantage	1
of	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
preparation	1
of	1
the	1
last	1
few	1
moments.	1
All	1
the	1
overpowering,	1
blinding,	1
bewildering,	1
first	1
effects	1
of	1
strong	1
surprise	1
were	1
over	1
with	1
her.	1
Still,	1
however,	1
she	1
had	1
enough	1
to	1
feel!	1
It	1
was	1
agitation,	1
pain,	1
pleasure,	1
a	1
something	1
between	1
delight	1
and	1
misery.	1
He	1
spoke	1
to	1
her,	1
and	1
then	1
turned	1
away.	1
The	1
character	1
of	1
his	1
manner	1
was	1
embarrassment.	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
called	1
it	1
either	1
cold	1
or	1
friendly,	1
or	1
anything	1
so	1
certainly	1
as	1
embarrassed.	1
After	1
a	1
short	1
interval,	1
however,	1
he	1
came	1
towards	1
her,	1
and	1
spoke	1
again.	1
Mutual	1
enquiries	1
on	1
common	1
subjects	1
passed:	1
neither	1
of	1
them,	1
probably,	1
much	1
the	1
wiser	1
for	1
what	1
they	1
heard,	1
and	1
Anne	1
continuing	1
fully	1
sensible	1
of	1
his	1
being	1
less	1
at	1
ease	1
than	1
formerly.	1
They	1
had	1
by	1
dint	1
of	1
being	1
so	1
very	1
much	1
together,	1
got	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
each	1
other	1
with	1
a	1
considerable	1
portion	1
of	1
apparent	1
indifference	1
and	1
calmness;	1
but	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
do	1
it	1
now.	1
Time	1
had	1
changed	1
him,	1
or	1
Louisa	1
had	1
changed	1
him.	1
There	1
was	1
consciousness	1
of	1
some	1
sort	1
or	1
other.	1
He	1
looked	1
very	1
well,	1
not	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
suffering	1
in	1
health	1
or	1
spirits,	1
and	1
he	1
talked	1
of	1
Uppercross,	1
of	1
the	1
Musgroves,	1
nay,	1
even	1
of	1
Louisa,	1
and	1
had	1
even	1
a	1
momentary	1
look	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
arch	1
significance	1
as	1
he	1
named	1
her;	1
but	1
yet	1
it	1
was	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
not	1
comfortable,	1
not	1
easy,	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
feign	1
that	1
he	1
was.	1
It	1
did	1
not	1
surprise,	1
but	1
it	1
grieved	1
Anne	1
to	1
observe	1
that	1
Elizabeth	1
would	1
not	1
know	1
him.	1
She	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
saw	1
Elizabeth,	1
that	1
Elizabeth	1
saw	1
him,	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
complete	1
internal	1
recognition	1
on	1
each	1
side;	1
she	1
was	1
convinced	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
be	1
acknowledged	1
as	1
an	1
acquaintance,	1
expecting	1
it,	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
the	1
pain	1
of	1
seeing	1
her	1
sister	1
turn	1
away	1
with	1
unalterable	1
coldness.	1
Lady	1
Dalrymple's	1
carriage,	1
for	1
which	1
Miss	1
Elliot	1
was	1
growing	1
very	1
impatient,	1
now	1
drew	1
up;	1
the	1
servant	1
came	1
in	1
to	1
announce	1
it.	1
It	1
was	1
beginning	1
to	1
rain	1
again,	1
and	1
altogether	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
delay,	1
and	1
a	1
bustle,	1
and	1
a	1
talking,	1
which	1
must	1
make	1
all	1
the	1
little	1
crowd	1
in	1
the	1
shop	1
understand	1
that	1
Lady	1
Dalrymple	1
was	1
calling	1
to	1
convey	1
Miss	1
Elliot.	1
At	1
last	1
Miss	1
Elliot	1
and	1
her	1
friend,	1
unattended	1
but	1
by	1
the	1
servant,	1
(for	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
cousin	1
returned),	1
were	1
walking	1
off;	1
and	1
Captain	1
Wentworth,	1
watching	1
them,	1
turned	1
again	1
to	1
Anne,	1
and	1
by	1
manner,	1
rather	1
than	1
words,	1
was	1
offering	1
his	1
services	1
to	1
her.	1
"I	1
am	1
much	1
obliged	1
to	1
you,"	1
was	1
her	1
answer,	1
"but	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
going	1
with	1
them.	1
The	1
carriage	1
would	1
not	1
accommodate	1
so	1
many.	1
I	1
walk:	1
I	1
prefer	1
walking."	1
"But	1
it	1
rains."	1
"Oh!	1
very	1
little,	1
Nothing	1
that	1
I	1
regard."	1
After	1
a	1
moment's	1
pause	1
he	1
said:	1
"Though	1
I	1
came	1
only	1
yesterday,	1
I	1
have	1
equipped	1
myself	1
properly	1
for	1
Bath	1
already,	1
you	1
see,"	1
(pointing	1
to	1
a	1
new	1
umbrella);	1
"I	1
wish	1
you	1
would	1
make	1
use	1
of	1
it,	1
if	1
you	1
are	1
determined	1
to	1
walk;	1
though	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
more	1
prudent	1
to	1
let	1
me	1
get	1
you	1
a	1
chair."	1
She	1
was	1
very	1
much	1
obliged	1
to	1
him,	1
but	1
declined	1
it	1
all,	1
repeating	1
her	1
conviction,	1
that	1
the	1
rain	1
would	1
come	1
to	1
nothing	1
at	1
present,	1
and	1
adding,	1
"I	1
am	1
only	1
waiting	1
for	1
Mr	1
Elliot.	1
He	1
will	1
be	1
here	1
in	1
a	1
moment,	1
I	1
am	1
sure."	1
She	1
had	1
hardly	1
spoken	1
the	1
words	1
when	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
walked	1
in.	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
recollected	1
him	1
perfectly.	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
difference	1
between	1
him	1
and	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
stood	1
on	1
the	1
steps	1
at	1
Lyme,	1
admiring	1
Anne	1
as	1
she	1
passed,	1
except	1
in	1
the	1
air	1
and	1
look	1
and	1
manner	1
of	1
the	1
privileged	1
relation	1
and	1
friend.	1
He	1
came	1
in	1
with	1
eagerness,	1
appeared	1
to	1
see	1
and	1
think	1
only	1
of	1
her,	1
apologised	1
for	1
his	1
stay,	1
was	1
grieved	1
to	1
have	1
kept	1
her	1
waiting,	1
and	1
anxious	1
to	1
get	1
her	1
away	1
without	1
further	1
loss	1
of	1
time	1
and	1
before	1
the	1
rain	1
increased;	1
and	1
in	1
another	1
moment	1
they	1
walked	1
off	1
together,	1
her	1
arm	1
under	1
his,	1
a	1
gentle	1
and	1
embarrassed	1
glance,	1
and	1
a	1
"Good	1
morning	1
to	1
you!"	1
being	1
all	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
time	1
for,	1
as	1
she	1
passed	1
away.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
out	1
of	1
sight,	1
the	1
ladies	1
of	1
Captain	1
Wentworth's	1
party	1
began	1
talking	1
of	1
them.	1
"Mr	1
Elliot	1
does	1
not	1
dislike	1
his	1
cousin,	1
I	1
fancy?"	1
"Oh!	1
no,	1
that	1
is	1
clear	1
enough.	1
One	1
can	1
guess	1
what	1
will	1
happen	1
there.	1
He	1
is	1
always	1
with	1
them;	1
half	1
lives	1
in	1
the	1
family,	1
I	1
believe.	1
What	1
a	1
very	1
good-looking	1
man!"	1
"Yes,	1
and	1
Miss	1
Atkinson,	1
who	1
dined	1
with	1
him	1
once	1
at	1
the	1
Wallises,	1
says	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
most	1
agreeable	1
man	1
she	1
ever	1
was	1
in	1
company	1
with."	1
"She	1
is	1
pretty,	1
I	1
think;	1
Anne	1
Elliot;	1
very	1
pretty,	1
when	1
one	1
comes	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
her.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
fashion	1
to	1
say	1
so,	1
but	1
I	1
confess	1
I	1
admire	1
her	1
more	1
than	1
her	1
sister."	1
"Oh!	1
so	1
do	1
I."	1
"And	1
so	1
do	1
I.	1
No	1
comparison.	1
But	1
the	1
men	1
are	1
all	1
wild	1
after	1
Miss	1
Elliot.	1
Anne	1
is	1
too	1
delicate	1
for	1
them."	1
Anne	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
particularly	1
obliged	1
to	1
her	1
cousin,	1
if	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
walked	1
by	1
her	1
side	1
all	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
Camden	1
Place,	1
without	1
saying	1
a	1
word.	1
She	1
had	1
never	1
found	1
it	1
so	1
difficult	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
him,	1
though	1
nothing	1
could	1
exceed	1
his	1
solicitude	1
and	1
care,	1
and	1
though	1
his	1
subjects	1
were	1
principally	1
such	1
as	1
were	1
wont	1
to	1
be	1
always	1
interesting:	1
praise,	1
warm,	1
just,	1
and	1
discriminating,	1
of	1
Lady	1
Russell,	1
and	1
insinuations	1
highly	1
rational	1
against	1
Mrs	1
Clay.	1
But	1
just	1
now	1
she	1
could	1
think	1
only	1
of	1
Captain	1
Wentworth.	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
understand	1
his	1
present	1
feelings,	1
whether	1
he	1
were	1
really	1
suffering	1
much	1
from	1
disappointment	1
or	1
not;	1
and	1
till	1
that	1
point	1
were	1
settled,	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
quite	1
herself.	1
She	1
hoped	1
to	1
be	1
wise	1
and	1
reasonable	1
in	1
time;	1
but	1
alas!	1
alas!	1
she	1
must	1
confess	1
to	1
herself	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
wise	1
yet.	1
Another	1
circumstance	1
very	1
essential	1
for	1
her	1
to	1
know,	1
was	1
how	1
long	1
he	1
meant	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
Bath;	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
mentioned	1
it,	1
or	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
recollect	1
it.	1
He	1
might	1
be	1
only	1
passing	1
through.	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
more	1
probable	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
come	1
to	1
stay.	1
In	1
that	1
case,	1
so	1
liable	1
as	1
every	1
body	1
was	1
to	1
meet	1
every	1
body	1
in	1
Bath,	1
Lady	1
Russell	1
would	1
in	1
all	1
likelihood	1
see	1
him	1
somewhere.	1
Would	1
she	1
recollect	1
him?	1
How	1
would	1
it	1
all	1
be?	1
She	1
had	1
already	1
been	1
obliged	1
to	1
tell	1
Lady	1
Russell	1
that	1
Louisa	1
Musgrove	1
was	1
to	1
marry	1
Captain	1
Benwick.	1
It	1
had	1
cost	1
her	1
something	1
to	1
encounter	1
Lady	1
Russell's	1
surprise;	1
and	1
now,	1
if	1
she	1
were	1
by	1
any	1
chance	1
to	1
be	1
thrown	1
into	1
company	1
with	1
Captain	1
Wentworth,	1
her	1
imperfect	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
matter	1
might	1
add	1
another	1
shade	1
of	1
prejudice	1
against	1
him.	1
The	1
following	1
morning	1
Anne	1
was	1
out	1
with	1
her	1
friend,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
hour,	1
in	1
an	1
incessant	1
and	1
fearful	1
sort	1
of	1
watch	1
for	1
him	1
in	1
vain;	1
but	1
at	1
last,	1
in	1
returning	1
down	1
Pulteney	1
Street,	1
she	1
distinguished	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
pavement	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
distance	1
as	1
to	1
have	1
him	1
in	1
view	1
the	1
greater	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
street.	1
There	1
were	1
many	1
other	1
men	1
about	1
him,	1
many	1
groups	1
walking	1
the	1
same	1
way,	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
mistaking	1
him.	1
She	1
looked	1
instinctively	1
at	1
Lady	1
Russell;	1
but	1
not	1
from	1
any	1
mad	1
idea	1
of	1
her	1
recognising	1
him	1
so	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
did	1
herself.	1
No,	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
supposed	1
that	1
Lady	1
Russell	1
would	1
perceive	1
him	1
till	1
they	1
were	1
nearly	1
opposite.	1
She	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
however,	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time,	1
anxiously;	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
moment	1
approached	1
which	1
must	1
point	1
him	1
out,	1
though	1
not	1
daring	1
to	1
look	1
again	1
(for	1
her	1
own	1
countenance	1
she	1
knew	1
was	1
unfit	1
to	1
be	1
seen),	1
she	1
was	1
yet	1
perfectly	1
conscious	1
of	1
Lady	1
Russell's	1
eyes	1
being	1
turned	1
exactly	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
for	1
him--	1
of	1
her	1
being,	1
in	1
short,	1
intently	1
observing	1
him.	1
She	1
could	1
thoroughly	1
comprehend	1
the	1
sort	1
of	1
fascination	1
he	1
must	1
possess	1
over	1
Lady	1
Russell's	1
mind,	1
the	1
difficulty	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
for	1
her	1
to	1
withdraw	1
her	1
eyes,	1
the	1
astonishment	1
she	1
must	1
be	1
feeling	1
that	1
eight	1
or	1
nine	1
years	1
should	1
have	1
passed	1
over	1
him,	1
and	1
in	1
foreign	1
climes	1
and	1
in	1
active	1
service	1
too,	1
without	1
robbing	1
him	1
of	1
one	1
personal	1
grace!	1
At	1
last,	1
Lady	1
Russell	1
drew	1
back	1
her	1
head.	1
"Now,	1
how	1
would	1
she	1
speak	1
of	1
him?"	1
"You	1
will	1
wonder,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"what	1
has	1
been	1
fixing	1
my	1
eye	1
so	1
long;	1
but	1
I	1
was	1
looking	1
after	1
some	1
window-curtains,	1
which	1
Lady	1
Alicia	1
and	1
Mrs	1
Frankland	1
were	1
telling	1
me	1
of	1
last	1
night.	1
They	1
described	1
the	1
drawing-room	1
window-curtains	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
houses	1
on	1
this	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
way,	1
and	1
this	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
street,	1
as	1
being	1
the	1
handsomest	1
and	1
best	1
hung	1
of	1
any	1
in	1
Bath,	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
recollect	1
the	1
exact	1
number,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
trying	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
which	1
it	1
could	1
be;	1
but	1
I	1
confess	1
I	1
can	1
see	1
no	1
curtains	1
hereabouts	1
that	1
answer	1
their	1
description."	1
Anne	1
sighed	1
and	1
blushed	1
and	1
smiled,	1
in	1
pity	1
and	1
disdain,	1
either	1
at	1
her	1
friend	1
or	1
herself.	1
The	1
part	1
which	1
provoked	1
her	1
most,	1
was	1
that	1
in	1
all	1
this	1
waste	1
of	1
foresight	1
and	1
caution,	1
she	1
should	1
have	1
lost	1
the	1
right	1
moment	1
for	1
seeing	1
whether	1
he	1
saw	1
them.	1
A	1
day	1
or	1
two	1
passed	1
without	1
producing	1
anything.	1
The	1
theatre	1
or	1
the	1
rooms,	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
most	1
likely	1
to	1
be,	1
were	1
not	1
fashionable	1
enough	1
for	1
the	1
Elliots,	1
whose	1
evening	1
amusements	1
were	1
solely	1
in	1
the	1
elegant	1
stupidity	1
of	1
private	1
parties,	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
getting	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
engaged;	1
and	1
Anne,	1
wearied	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
stagnation,	1
sick	1
of	1
knowing	1
nothing,	1
and	1
fancying	1
herself	1
stronger	1
because	1
her	1
strength	1
was	1
not	1
tried,	1
was	1
quite	1
impatient	1
for	1
the	1
concert	1
evening.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
concert	1
for	1
the	1
benefit	1
of	1
a	1
person	1
patronised	1
by	1
Lady	1
Dalrymple.	1
Of	1
course	1
they	1
must	1
attend.	1
It	1
was	1
really	1
expected	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
good	1
one,	1
and	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
was	1
very	1
fond	1
of	1
music.	1
If	1
she	1
could	1
only	1
have	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
conversation	1
with	1
him	1
again,	1
she	1
fancied	1
she	1
should	1
be	1
satisfied;	1
and	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
addressing	1
him,	1
she	1
felt	1
all	1
over	1
courage	1
if	1
the	1
opportunity	1
occurred.	1
Elizabeth	1
had	1
turned	1
from	1
him,	1
Lady	1
Russell	1
overlooked	1
him;	1
her	1
nerves	1
were	1
strengthened	1
by	1
these	1
circumstances;	1
she	1
felt	1
that	1
she	1
owed	1
him	1
attention.	1
She	1
had	1
once	1
partly	1
promised	1
Mrs	1
Smith	1
to	1
spend	1
the	1
evening	1
with	1
her;	1
but	1
in	1
a	1
short	1
hurried	1
call	1
she	1
excused	1
herself	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
off,	1
with	1
the	1
more	1
decided	1
promise	1
of	1
a	1
longer	1
visit	1
on	1
the	1
morrow.	1
Mrs	1
Smith	1
gave	1
a	1
most	1
good-humoured	1
acquiescence.	1
"By	1
all	1
means,"	1
said	1
she;	1
"only	1
tell	1
me	1
all	1
about	1
it,	1
when	1
you	1
do	1
come.	1
Who	1
is	1
your	1
party?"	1
Anne	1
named	1
them	1
all.	1
Mrs	1
Smith	1
made	1
no	1
reply;	1
but	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
leaving	1
her	1
said,	1
and	1
with	1
an	1
expression	1
half	1
serious,	1
half	1
arch,	1
"Well,	1
I	1
heartily	1
wish	1
your	1
concert	1
may	1
answer;	1
and	1
do	1
not	1
fail	1
me	1
to-morrow	1
if	1
you	1
can	1
come;	1
for	1
I	1
begin	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
foreboding	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
not	1
have	1
many	1
more	1
visits	1
from	1
you."	1
Anne	1
was	1
startled	1
and	1
confused;	1
but	1
after	1
standing	1
in	1
a	1
moment's	1
suspense,	1
was	1
obliged,	1
and	1
not	1
sorry	1
to	1
be	1
obliged,	1
to	1
hurry	1
away.	1
Chapter	1
20	1
Sir	1
Walter,	1
his	1
two	1
daughters,	1
and	1
Mrs	1
Clay,	1
were	1
the	1
earliest	1
of	1
all	1
their	1
party	1
at	1
the	1
rooms	1
in	1
the	1
evening;	1
and	1
as	1
Lady	1
Dalrymple	1
must	1
be	1
waited	1
for,	1
they	1
took	1
their	1
station	1
by	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
fires	1
in	1
the	1
Octagon	1
Room.	1
But	1
hardly	1
were	1
they	1
so	1
settled,	1
when	1
the	1
door	1
opened	1
again,	1
and	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
walked	1
in	1
alone.	1
Anne	1
was	1
the	1
nearest	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
making	1
yet	1
a	1
little	1
advance,	1
she	1
instantly	1
spoke.	1
He	1
was	1
preparing	1
only	1
to	1
bow	1
and	1
pass	1
on,	1
but	1
her	1
gentle	1
"How	1
do	1
you	1
do?"	1
brought	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
straight	1
line	1
to	1
stand	1
near	1
her,	1
and	1
make	1
enquiries	1
in	1
return,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
formidable	1
father	1
and	1
sister	1
in	1
the	1
back	1
ground.	1
Their	1
being	1
in	1
the	1
back	1
ground	1
was	1
a	1
support	1
to	1
Anne;	1
she	1
knew	1
nothing	1
of	1
their	1
looks,	1
and	1
felt	1
equal	1
to	1
everything	1
which	1
she	1
believed	1
right	1
to	1
be	1
done.	1
While	1
they	1
were	1
speaking,	1
a	1
whispering	1
between	1
her	1
father	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
caught	1
her	1
ear.	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
distinguish,	1
but	1
she	1
must	1
guess	1
the	1
subject;	1
and	1
on	1
Captain	1
Wentworth's	1
making	1
a	1
distant	1
bow,	1
she	1
comprehended	1
that	1
her	1
father	1
had	1
judged	1
so	1
well	1
as	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
that	1
simple	1
acknowledgement	1
of	1
acquaintance,	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
just	1
in	1
time	1
by	1
a	1
side	1
glance	1
to	1
see	1
a	1
slight	1
curtsey	1
from	1
Elizabeth	1
herself.	1
This,	1
though	1
late,	1
and	1
reluctant,	1
and	1
ungracious,	1
was	1
yet	1
better	1
than	1
nothing,	1
and	1
her	1
spirits	1
improved.	1
After	1
talking,	1
however,	1
of	1
the	1
weather,	1
and	1
Bath,	1
and	1
the	1
concert,	1
their	1
conversation	1
began	1
to	1
flag,	1
and	1
so	1
little	1
was	1
said	1
at	1
last,	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
expecting	1
him	1
to	1
go	1
every	1
moment,	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
not;	1
he	1
seemed	1
in	1
no	1
hurry	1
to	1
leave	1
her;	1
and	1
presently	1
with	1
renewed	1
spirit,	1
with	1
a	1
little	1
smile,	1
a	1
little	1
glow,	1
he	1
said--	1
"I	1
have	1
hardly	1
seen	1
you	1
since	1
our	1
day	1
at	1
Lyme.	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
you	1
must	1
have	1
suffered	1
from	1
the	1
shock,	1
and	1
the	1
more	1
from	1
its	1
not	1
overpowering	1
you	1
at	1
the	1
time."	1
She	1
assured	1
him	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
not.	1
"It	1
was	1
a	1
frightful	1
hour,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"a	1
frightful	1
day!"	1
and	1
he	1
passed	1
his	1
hand	1
across	1
his	1
eyes,	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
remembrance	1
were	1
still	1
too	1
painful,	1
but	1
in	1
a	1
moment,	1
half	1
smiling	1
again,	1
added,	1
"The	1
day	1
has	1
produced	1
some	1
effects	1
however;	1
has	1
had	1
some	1
consequences	1
which	1
must	1
be	1
considered	1
as	1
the	1
very	1
reverse	1
of	1
frightful.	1
When	1
you	1
had	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
mind	1
to	1
suggest	1
that	1
Benwick	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
properest	1
person	1
to	1
fetch	1
a	1
surgeon,	1
you	1
could	1
have	1
little	1
idea	1
of	1
his	1
being	1
eventually	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
most	1
concerned	1
in	1
her	1
recovery."	1
"Certainly	1
I	1
could	1
have	1
none.	1
But	1
it	1
appears--I	1
should	1
hope	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
very	1
happy	1
match.	1
There	1
are	1
on	1
both	1
sides	1
good	1
principles	1
and	1
good	1
temper."	1
"Yes,"	1
said	1
he,	1
looking	1
not	1
exactly	1
forward;	1
"but	1
there,	1
I	1
think,	1
ends	1
the	1
resemblance.	1
With	1
all	1
my	1
soul	1
I	1
wish	1
them	1
happy,	1
and	1
rejoice	1
over	1
every	1
circumstance	1
in	1
favour	1
of	1
it.	1
They	1
have	1
no	1
difficulties	1
to	1
contend	1
with	1
at	1
home,	1
no	1
opposition,	1
no	1
caprice,	1
no	1
delays.	1
The	1
Musgroves	1
are	1
behaving	1
like	1
themselves,	1
most	1
honourably	1
and	1
kindly,	1
only	1
anxious	1
with	1
true	1
parental	1
hearts	1
to	1
promote	1
their	1
daughter's	1
comfort.	1
All	1
this	1
is	1
much,	1
very	1
much	1
in	1
favour	1
of	1
their	1
happiness;	1
more	1
than	1
perhaps--"	1
He	1
stopped.	1
A	1
sudden	1
recollection	1
seemed	1
to	1
occur,	1
and	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
some	1
taste	1
of	1
that	1
emotion	1
which	1
was	1
reddening	1
Anne's	1
cheeks	1
and	1
fixing	1
her	1
eyes	1
on	1
the	1
ground.	1
After	1
clearing	1
his	1
throat,	1
however,	1
he	1
proceeded	1
thus--	1
"I	1
confess	1
that	1
I	1
do	1
think	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
disparity,	1
too	1
great	1
a	1
disparity,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
point	1
no	1
less	1
essential	1
than	1
mind.	1
I	1
regard	1
Louisa	1
Musgrove	1
as	1
a	1
very	1
amiable,	1
sweet-tempered	1
girl,	1
and	1
not	1
deficient	1
in	1
understanding,	1
but	1
Benwick	1
is	1
something	1
more.	1
He	1
is	1
a	1
clever	1
man,	1
a	1
reading	1
man;	1
and	1
I	1
confess,	1
that	1
I	1
do	1
consider	1
his	1
attaching	1
himself	1
to	1
her	1
with	1
some	1
surprise.	1
Had	1
it	1
been	1
the	1
effect	1
of	1
gratitude,	1
had	1
he	1
learnt	1
to	1
love	1
her,	1
because	1
he	1
believed	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
preferring	1
him,	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
another	1
thing.	1
But	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
reason	1
to	1
suppose	1
it	1
so.	1
It	1
seems,	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
perfectly	1
spontaneous,	1
untaught	1
feeling	1
on	1
his	1
side,	1
and	1
this	1
surprises	1
me.	1
A	1
man	1
like	1
him,	1
in	1
his	1
situation!	1
with	1
a	1
heart	1
pierced,	1
wounded,	1
almost	1
broken!	1
Fanny	1
Harville	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
superior	1
creature,	1
and	1
his	1
attachment	1
to	1
her	1
was	1
indeed	1
attachment.	1
A	1
man	1
does	1
not	1
recover	1
from	1
such	1
a	1
devotion	1
of	1
the	1
heart	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
woman.	1
He	1
ought	1
not;	1
he	1
does	1
not."	1
Either	1
from	1
the	1
consciousness,	1
however,	1
that	1
his	1
friend	1
had	1
recovered,	1
or	1
from	1
other	1
consciousness,	1
he	1
went	1
no	1
farther;	1
and	1
Anne	1
who,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
agitated	1
voice	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
latter	1
part	1
had	1
been	1
uttered,	1
and	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
various	1
noises	1
of	1
the	1
room,	1
the	1
almost	1
ceaseless	1
slam	1
of	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
ceaseless	1
buzz	1
of	1
persons	1
walking	1
through,	1
had	1
distinguished	1
every	1
word,	1
was	1
struck,	1
gratified,	1
confused,	1
and	1
beginning	1
to	1
breathe	1
very	1
quick,	1
and	1
feel	1
an	1
hundred	1
things	1
in	1
a	1
moment.	1
It	1
was	1
impossible	1
for	1
her	1
to	1
enter	1
on	1
such	1
a	1
subject;	1
and	1
yet,	1
after	1
a	1
pause,	1
feeling	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
speaking,	1
and	1
having	1
not	1
the	1
smallest	1
wish	1
for	1
a	1
total	1
change,	1
she	1
only	1
deviated	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
to	1
say--	1
"You	1
were	1
a	1
good	1
while	1
at	1
Lyme,	1
I	1
think?"	1
"About	1
a	1
fortnight.	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
leave	1
it	1
till	1
Louisa's	1
doing	1
well	1
was	1
quite	1
ascertained.	1
I	1
had	1
been	1
too	1
deeply	1
concerned	1
in	1
the	1
mischief	1
to	1
be	1
soon	1
at	1
peace.	1
It	1
had	1
been	1
my	1
doing,	1
solely	1
mine.	1
She	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
obstinate	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
weak.	1
The	1
country	1
round	1
Lyme	1
is	1
very	1
fine.	1
I	1
walked	1
and	1
rode	1
a	1
great	1
deal;	1
and	1
the	1
more	1
I	1
saw,	1
the	1
more	1
I	1
found	1
to	1
admire."	1
"I	1
should	1
very	1
much	1
like	1
to	1
see	1
Lyme	1
again,"	1
said	1
Anne.	1
"Indeed!	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
supposed	1
that	1
you	1
could	1
have	1
found	1
anything	1
in	1
Lyme	1
to	1
inspire	1
such	1
a	1
feeling.	1
The	1
horror	1
and	1
distress	1
you	1
were	1
involved	1
in,	1
the	1
stretch	1
of	1
mind,	1
the	1
wear	1
of	1
spirits!	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
thought	1
your	1
last	1
impressions	1
of	1
Lyme	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
strong	1
disgust."	1
"The	1
last	1
hours	1
were	1
certainly	1
very	1
painful,"	1
replied	1
Anne;	1
"but	1
when	1
pain	1
is	1
over,	1
the	1
remembrance	1
of	1
it	1
often	1
becomes	1
a	1
pleasure.	1
One	1
does	1
not	1
love	1
a	1
place	1
the	1
less	1
for	1
having	1
suffered	1
in	1
it,	1
unless	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
all	1
suffering,	1
nothing	1
but	1
suffering,	1
which	1
was	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
the	1
case	1
at	1
Lyme.	1
We	1
were	1
only	1
in	1
anxiety	1
and	1
distress	1
during	1
the	1
last	1
two	1
hours,	1
and	1
previously	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
enjoyment.	1
So	1
much	1
novelty	1
and	1
beauty!	1
I	1
have	1
travelled	1
so	1
little,	1
that	1
every	1
fresh	1
place	1
would	1
be	1
interesting	1
to	1
me;	1
but	1
there	1
is	1
real	1
beauty	1
at	1
Lyme;	1
and	1
in	1
short"	1
(with	1
a	1
faint	1
blush	1
at	1
some	1
recollections),	1
"altogether	1
my	1
impressions	1
of	1
the	1
place	1
are	1
very	1
agreeable."	1
As	1
she	1
ceased,	1
the	1
entrance	1
door	1
opened	1
again,	1
and	1
the	1
very	1
party	1
appeared	1
for	1
whom	1
they	1
were	1
waiting.	1
"Lady	1
Dalrymple,	1
Lady	1
Dalrymple,"	1
was	1
the	1
rejoicing	1
sound;	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
eagerness	1
compatible	1
with	1
anxious	1
elegance,	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
and	1
his	1
two	1
ladies	1
stepped	1
forward	1
to	1
meet	1
her.	1
Lady	1
Dalrymple	1
and	1
Miss	1
Carteret,	1
escorted	1
by	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
and	1
Colonel	1
Wallis,	1
who	1
had	1
happened	1
to	1
arrive	1
nearly	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
instant,	1
advanced	1
into	1
the	1
room.	1
The	1
others	1
joined	1
them,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
group	1
in	1
which	1
Anne	1
found	1
herself	1
also	1
necessarily	1
included.	1
She	1
was	1
divided	1
from	1
Captain	1
Wentworth.	1
Their	1
interesting,	1
almost	1
too	1
interesting	1
conversation	1
must	1
be	1
broken	1
up	1
for	1
a	1
time,	1
but	1
slight	1
was	1
the	1
penance	1
compared	1
with	1
the	1
happiness	1
which	1
brought	1
it	1
on!	1
She	1
had	1
learnt,	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
ten	1
minutes,	1
more	1
of	1
his	1
feelings	1
towards	1
Louisa,	1
more	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
feelings	1
than	1
she	1
dared	1
to	1
think	1
of;	1
and	1
she	1
gave	1
herself	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
demands	1
of	1
the	1
party,	1
to	1
the	1
needful	1
civilities	1
of	1
the	1
moment,	1
with	1
exquisite,	1
though	1
agitated	1
sensations.	1
She	1
was	1
in	1
good	1
humour	1
with	1
all.	1
She	1
had	1
received	1
ideas	1
which	1
disposed	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
courteous	1
and	1
kind	1
to	1
all,	1
and	1
to	1
pity	1
every	1
one,	1
as	1
being	1
less	1
happy	1
than	1
herself.	1
The	1
delightful	1
emotions	1
were	1
a	1
little	1
subdued,	1
when	1
on	1
stepping	1
back	1
from	1
the	1
group,	1
to	1
be	1
joined	1
again	1
by	1
Captain	1
Wentworth,	1
she	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
gone.	1
She	1
was	1
just	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
turn	1
into	1
the	1
Concert	1
Room.	1
He	1
was	1
gone;	1
he	1
had	1
disappeared,	1
she	1
felt	1
a	1
moment's	1
regret.	1
But	1
"they	1
should	1
meet	1
again.	1
He	1
would	1
look	1
for	1
her,	1
he	1
would	1
find	1
her	1
out	1
before	1
the	1
evening	1
were	1
over,	1
and	1
at	1
present,	1
perhaps,	1
it	1
was	1
as	1
well	1
to	1
be	1
asunder.	1
She	1
was	1
in	1
need	1
of	1
a	1
little	1
interval	1
for	1
recollection."	1
Upon	1
Lady	1
Russell's	1
appearance	1
soon	1
afterwards,	1
the	1
whole	1
party	1
was	1
collected,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
remained	1
was	1
to	1
marshal	1
themselves,	1
and	1
proceed	1
into	1
the	1
Concert	1
Room;	1
and	1
be	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
consequence	1
in	1
their	1
power,	1
draw	1
as	1
many	1
eyes,	1
excite	1
as	1
many	1
whispers,	1
and	1
disturb	1
as	1
many	1
people	1
as	1
they	1
could.	1
Very,	1
very	1
happy	1
were	1
both	1
Elizabeth	1
and	1
Anne	1
Elliot	1
as	1
they	1
walked	1
in.	1
Elizabeth	1
arm	1
in	1
arm	1
with	1
Miss	1
Carteret,	1
and	1
looking	1
on	1
the	1
broad	1
back	1
of	1
the	1
dowager	1
Viscountess	1
Dalrymple	1
before	1
her,	1
had	1
nothing	1
to	1
wish	1
for	1
which	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
within	1
her	1
reach;	1
and	1
Anne--but	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
an	1
insult	1
to	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
Anne's	1
felicity,	1
to	1
draw	1
any	1
comparison	1
between	1
it	1
and	1
her	1
sister's;	1
the	1
origin	1
of	1
one	1
all	1
selfish	1
vanity,	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
all	1
generous	1
attachment.	1
Anne	1
saw	1
nothing,	1
thought	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
brilliancy	1
of	1
the	1
room.	1
Her	1
happiness	1
was	1
from	1
within.	1
Her	1
eyes	1
were	1
bright	1
and	1
her	1
cheeks	1
glowed;	1
but	1
she	1
knew	1
nothing	1
about	1
it.	1
She	1
was	1
thinking	1
only	1
of	1
the	1
last	1
half	1
hour,	1
and	1
as	1
they	1
passed	1
to	1
their	1
seats,	1
her	1
mind	1
took	1
a	1
hasty	1
range	1
over	1
it.	1
His	1
choice	1
of	1
subjects,	1
his	1
expressions,	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
his	1
manner	1
and	1
look,	1
had	1
been	1
such	1
as	1
she	1
could	1
see	1
in	1
only	1
one	1
light.	1
His	1
opinion	1
of	1
Louisa	1
Musgrove's	1
inferiority,	1
an	1
opinion	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
seemed	1
solicitous	1
to	1
give,	1
his	1
wonder	1
at	1
Captain	1
Benwick,	1
his	1
feelings	1
as	1
to	1
a	1
first,	1
strong	1
attachment;	1
sentences	1
begun	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
finish,	1
his	1
half	1
averted	1
eyes	1
and	1
more	1
than	1
half	1
expressive	1
glance,	1
all,	1
all	1
declared	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
heart	1
returning	1
to	1
her	1
at	1
least;	1
that	1
anger,	1
resentment,	1
avoidance,	1
were	1
no	1
more;	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
succeeded,	1
not	1
merely	1
by	1
friendship	1
and	1
regard,	1
but	1
by	1
the	1
tenderness	1
of	1
the	1
past.	1
Yes,	1
some	1
share	1
of	1
the	1
tenderness	1
of	1
the	1
past.	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
contemplate	1
the	1
change	1
as	1
implying	1
less.	1
He	1
must	1
love	1
her.	1
These	1
were	1
thoughts,	1
with	1
their	1
attendant	1
visions,	1
which	1
occupied	1
and	1
flurried	1
her	1
too	1
much	1
to	1
leave	1
her	1
any	1
power	1
of	1
observation;	1
and	1
she	1
passed	1
along	1
the	1
room	1
without	1
having	1
a	1
glimpse	1
of	1
him,	1
without	1
even	1
trying	1
to	1
discern	1
him.	1
When	1
their	1
places	1
were	1
determined	1
on,	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
properly	1
arranged,	1
she	1
looked	1
round	1
to	1
see	1
if	1
he	1
should	1
happen	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
room,	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
not;	1
her	1
eye	1
could	1
not	1
reach	1
him;	1
and	1
the	1
concert	1
being	1
just	1
opening,	1
she	1
must	1
consent	1
for	1
a	1
time	1
to	1
be	1
happy	1
in	1
a	1
humbler	1
way.	1
The	1
party	1
was	1
divided	1
and	1
disposed	1
of	1
on	1
two	1
contiguous	1
benches:	1
Anne	1
was	1
among	1
those	1
on	1
the	1
foremost,	1
and	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
had	1
manoeuvred	1
so	1
well,	1
with	1
the	1
assistance	1
of	1
his	1
friend	1
Colonel	1
Wallis,	1
as	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
seat	1
by	1
her.	1
Miss	1
Elliot,	1
surrounded	1
by	1
her	1
cousins,	1
and	1
the	1
principal	1
object	1
of	1
Colonel	1
Wallis's	1
gallantry,	1
was	1
quite	1
contented.	1
Anne's	1
mind	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
most	1
favourable	1
state	1
for	1
the	1
entertainment	1
of	1
the	1
evening;	1
it	1
was	1
just	1
occupation	1
enough:	1
she	1
had	1
feelings	1
for	1
the	1
tender,	1
spirits	1
for	1
the	1
gay,	1
attention	1
for	1
the	1
scientific,	1
and	1
patience	1
for	1
the	1
wearisome;	1
and	1
had	1
never	1
liked	1
a	1
concert	1
better,	1
at	1
least	1
during	1
the	1
first	1
act.	1
Towards	1
the	1
close	1
of	1
it,	1
in	1
the	1
interval	1
succeeding	1
an	1
Italian	1
song,	1
she	1
explained	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
song	1
to	1
Mr	1
Elliot.	1
They	1
had	1
a	1
concert	1
bill	1
between	1
them.	1
"This,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"is	1
nearly	1
the	1
sense,	1
or	1
rather	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
the	1
words,	1
for	1
certainly	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
an	1
Italian	1
love-song	1
must	1
not	1
be	1
talked	1
of,	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
as	1
nearly	1
the	1
meaning	1
as	1
I	1
can	1
give;	1
for	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
pretend	1
to	1
understand	1
the	1
language.	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
very	1
poor	1
Italian	1
scholar."	1
"Yes,	1
yes,	1
I	1
see	1
you	1
are.	1
I	1
see	1
you	1
know	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
matter.	1
You	1
have	1
only	1
knowledge	1
enough	1
of	1
the	1
language	1
to	1
translate	1
at	1
sight	1
these	1
inverted,	1
transposed,	1
curtailed	1
Italian	1
lines,	1
into	1
clear,	1
comprehensible,	1
elegant	1
English.	1
You	1
need	1
not	1
say	1
anything	1
more	1
of	1
your	1
ignorance.	1
Here	1
is	1
complete	1
proof."	1
"I	1
will	1
not	1
oppose	1
such	1
kind	1
politeness;	1
but	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
sorry	1
to	1
be	1
examined	1
by	1
a	1
real	1
proficient."	1
"I	1
have	1
not	1
had	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
visiting	1
in	1
Camden	1
Place	1
so	1
long,"	1
replied	1
he,	1
"without	1
knowing	1
something	1
of	1
Miss	1
Anne	1
Elliot;	1
and	1
I	1
do	1
regard	1
her	1
as	1
one	1
who	1
is	1
too	1
modest	1
for	1
the	1
world	1
in	1
general	1
to	1
be	1
aware	1
of	1
half	1
her	1
accomplishments,	1
and	1
too	1
highly	1
accomplished	1
for	1
modesty	1
to	1
be	1
natural	1
in	1
any	1
other	1
woman."	1
"For	1
shame!	1
for	1
shame!	1
this	1
is	1
too	1
much	1
flattery.	1
I	1
forget	1
what	1
we	1
are	1
to	1
have	1
next,"	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
bill.	1
"Perhaps,"	1
said	1
Mr	1
Elliot,	1
speaking	1
low,	1
"I	1
have	1
had	1
a	1
longer	1
acquaintance	1
with	1
your	1
character	1
than	1
you	1
are	1
aware	1
of."	1
"Indeed!	1
How	1
so?	1
You	1
can	1
have	1
been	1
acquainted	1
with	1
it	1
only	1
since	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
Bath,	1
excepting	1
as	1
you	1
might	1
hear	1
me	1
previously	1
spoken	1
of	1
in	1
my	1
own	1
family."	1
"I	1
knew	1
you	1
by	1
report	1
long	1
before	1
you	1
came	1
to	1
Bath.	1
I	1
had	1
heard	1
you	1
described	1
by	1
those	1
who	1
knew	1
you	1
intimately.	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
acquainted	1
with	1
you	1
by	1
character	1
many	1
years.	1
Your	1
person,	1
your	1
disposition,	1
accomplishments,	1
manner;	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
present	1
to	1
me."	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
was	1
not	1
disappointed	1
in	1
the	1
interest	1
he	1
hoped	1
to	1
raise.	1
No	1
one	1
can	1
withstand	1
the	1
charm	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
mystery.	1
To	1
have	1
been	1
described	1
long	1
ago	1
to	1
a	1
recent	1
acquaintance,	1
by	1
nameless	1
people,	1
is	1
irresistible;	1
and	1
Anne	1
was	1
all	1
curiosity.	1
She	1
wondered,	1
and	1
questioned	1
him	1
eagerly;	1
but	1
in	1
vain.	1
He	1
delighted	1
in	1
being	1
asked,	1
but	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
tell.	1
"No,	1
no,	1
some	1
time	1
or	1
other,	1
perhaps,	1
but	1
not	1
now.	1
He	1
would	1
mention	1
no	1
names	1
now;	1
but	1
such,	1
he	1
could	1
assure	1
her,	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
fact.	1
He	1
had	1
many	1
years	1
ago	1
received	1
such	1
a	1
description	1
of	1
Miss	1
Anne	1
Elliot	1
as	1
had	1
inspired	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
highest	1
idea	1
of	1
her	1
merit,	1
and	1
excited	1
the	1
warmest	1
curiosity	1
to	1
know	1
her."	1
Anne	1
could	1
think	1
of	1
no	1
one	1
so	1
likely	1
to	1
have	1
spoken	1
with	1
partiality	1
of	1
her	1
many	1
years	1
ago	1
as	1
the	1
Mr	1
Wentworth	1
of	1
Monkford,	1
Captain	1
Wentworth's	1
brother.	1
He	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
Mr	1
Elliot's	1
company,	1
but	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
courage	1
to	1
ask	1
the	1
question.	1
"The	1
name	1
of	1
Anne	1
Elliot,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"has	1
long	1
had	1
an	1
interesting	1
sound	1
to	1
me.	1
Very	1
long	1
has	1
it	1
possessed	1
a	1
charm	1
over	1
my	1
fancy;	1
and,	1
if	1
I	1
dared,	1
I	1
would	1
breathe	1
my	1
wishes	1
that	1
the	1
name	1
might	1
never	1
change."	1
Such,	1
she	1
believed,	1
were	1
his	1
words;	1
but	1
scarcely	1
had	1
she	1
received	1
their	1
sound,	1
than	1
her	1
attention	1
was	1
caught	1
by	1
other	1
sounds	1
immediately	1
behind	1
her,	1
which	1
rendered	1
every	1
thing	1
else	1
trivial.	1
Her	1
father	1
and	1
Lady	1
Dalrymple	1
were	1
speaking.	1
"A	1
well-looking	1
man,"	1
said	1
Sir	1
Walter,	1
"a	1
very	1
well-looking	1
man."	1
"A	1
very	1
fine	1
young	1
man	1
indeed!"	1
said	1
Lady	1
Dalrymple.	1
"More	1
air	1
than	1
one	1
often	1
sees	1
in	1
Bath.	1
Irish,	1
I	1
dare	1
say."	1
"No,	1
I	1
just	1
know	1
his	1
name.	1
A	1
bowing	1
acquaintance.	1
Wentworth;	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
of	1
the	1
navy.	1
His	1
sister	1
married	1
my	1
tenant	1
in	1
Somersetshire,	1
the	1
Croft,	1
who	1
rents	1
Kellynch."	1
Before	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
had	1
reached	1
this	1
point,	1
Anne's	1
eyes	1
had	1
caught	1
the	1
right	1
direction,	1
and	1
distinguished	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
standing	1
among	1
a	1
cluster	1
of	1
men	1
at	1
a	1
little	1
distance.	1
As	1
her	1
eyes	1
fell	1
on	1
him,	1
his	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
withdrawn	1
from	1
her.	1
It	1
had	1
that	1
appearance.	1
It	1
seemed	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
one	1
moment	1
too	1
late;	1
and	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
she	1
dared	1
observe,	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
look	1
again:	1
but	1
the	1
performance	1
was	1
recommencing,	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
forced	1
to	1
seem	1
to	1
restore	1
her	1
attention	1
to	1
the	1
orchestra	1
and	1
look	1
straight	1
forward.	1
When	1
she	1
could	1
give	1
another	1
glance,	1
he	1
had	1
moved	1
away.	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
come	1
nearer	1
to	1
her	1
if	1
he	1
would;	1
she	1
was	1
so	1
surrounded	1
and	1
shut	1
in:	1
but	1
she	1
would	1
rather	1
have	1
caught	1
his	1
eye.	1
Mr	1
Elliot's	1
speech,	1
too,	1
distressed	1
her.	1
She	1
had	1
no	1
longer	1
any	1
inclination	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
him.	1
She	1
wished	1
him	1
not	1
so	1
near	1
her.	1
The	1
first	1
act	1
was	1
over.	1
Now	1
she	1
hoped	1
for	1
some	1
beneficial	1
change;	1
and,	1
after	1
a	1
period	1
of	1
nothing-saying	1
amongst	1
the	1
party,	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
did	1
decide	1
on	1
going	1
in	1
quest	1
of	1
tea.	1
Anne	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
few	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
choose	1
to	1
move.	1
She	1
remained	1
in	1
her	1
seat,	1
and	1
so	1
did	1
Lady	1
Russell;	1
but	1
she	1
had	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
getting	1
rid	1
of	1
Mr	1
Elliot;	1
and	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
mean,	1
whatever	1
she	1
might	1
feel	1
on	1
Lady	1
Russell's	1
account,	1
to	1
shrink	1
from	1
conversation	1
with	1
Captain	1
Wentworth,	1
if	1
he	1
gave	1
her	1
the	1
opportunity.	1
She	1
was	1
persuaded	1
by	1
Lady	1
Russell's	1
countenance	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
seen	1
him.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
come	1
however.	1
Anne	1
sometimes	1
fancied	1
she	1
discerned	1
him	1
at	1
a	1
distance,	1
but	1
he	1
never	1
came.	1
The	1
anxious	1
interval	1
wore	1
away	1
unproductively.	1
The	1
others	1
returned,	1
the	1
room	1
filled	1
again,	1
benches	1
were	1
reclaimed	1
and	1
repossessed,	1
and	1
another	1
hour	1
of	1
pleasure	1
or	1
of	1
penance	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
sat	1
out,	1
another	1
hour	1
of	1
music	1
was	1
to	1
give	1
delight	1
or	1
the	1
gapes,	1
as	1
real	1
or	1
affected	1
taste	1
for	1
it	1
prevailed.	1
To	1
Anne,	1
it	1
chiefly	1
wore	1
the	1
prospect	1
of	1
an	1
hour	1
of	1
agitation.	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
quit	1
that	1
room	1
in	1
peace	1
without	1
seeing	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
once	1
more,	1
without	1
the	1
interchange	1
of	1
one	1
friendly	1
look.	1
In	1
re-settling	1
themselves	1
there	1
were	1
now	1
many	1
changes,	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
which	1
was	1
favourable	1
for	1
her.	1
Colonel	1
Wallis	1
declined	1
sitting	1
down	1
again,	1
and	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
was	1
invited	1
by	1
Elizabeth	1
and	1
Miss	1
Carteret,	1
in	1
a	1
manner	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
refused,	1
to	1
sit	1
between	1
them;	1
and	1
by	1
some	1
other	1
removals,	1
and	1
a	1
little	1
scheming	1
of	1
her	1
own,	1
Anne	1
was	1
enabled	1
to	1
place	1
herself	1
much	1
nearer	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
bench	1
than	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
before,	1
much	1
more	1
within	1
reach	1
of	1
a	1
passer-by.	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
do	1
so,	1
without	1
comparing	1
herself	1
with	1
Miss	1
Larolles,	1
the	1
inimitable	1
Miss	1
Larolles;	1
but	1
still	1
she	1
did	1
it,	1
and	1
not	1
with	1
much	1
happier	1
effect;	1
though	1
by	1
what	1
seemed	1
prosperity	1
in	1
the	1
shape	1
of	1
an	1
early	1
abdication	1
in	1
her	1
next	1
neighbours,	1
she	1
found	1
herself	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
bench	1
before	1
the	1
concert	1
closed.	1
Such	1
was	1
her	1
situation,	1
with	1
a	1
vacant	1
space	1
at	1
hand,	1
when	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
was	1
again	1
in	1
sight.	1
She	1
saw	1
him	1
not	1
far	1
off.	1
He	1
saw	1
her	1
too;	1
yet	1
he	1
looked	1
grave,	1
and	1
seemed	1
irresolute,	1
and	1
only	1
by	1
very	1
slow	1
degrees	1
came	1
at	1
last	1
near	1
enough	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
her.	1
She	1
felt	1
that	1
something	1
must	1
be	1
the	1
matter.	1
The	1
change	1
was	1
indubitable.	1
The	1
difference	1
between	1
his	1
present	1
air	1
and	1
what	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
Octagon	1
Room	1
was	1
strikingly	1
great.	1
Why	1
was	1
it?	1
She	1
thought	1
of	1
her	1
father,	1
of	1
Lady	1
Russell.	1
Could	1
there	1
have	1
been	1
any	1
unpleasant	1
glances?	1
He	1
began	1
by	1
speaking	1
of	1
the	1
concert	1
gravely,	1
more	1
like	1
the	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
of	1
Uppercross;	1
owned	1
himself	1
disappointed,	1
had	1
expected	1
singing;	1
and	1
in	1
short,	1
must	1
confess	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
sorry	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
over.	1
Anne	1
replied,	1
and	1
spoke	1
in	1
defence	1
of	1
the	1
performance	1
so	1
well,	1
and	1
yet	1
in	1
allowance	1
for	1
his	1
feelings	1
so	1
pleasantly,	1
that	1
his	1
countenance	1
improved,	1
and	1
he	1
replied	1
again	1
with	1
almost	1
a	1
smile.	1
They	1
talked	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
more;	1
the	1
improvement	1
held;	1
he	1
even	1
looked	1
down	1
towards	1
the	1
bench,	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
saw	1
a	1
place	1
on	1
it	1
well	1
worth	1
occupying;	1
when	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
a	1
touch	1
on	1
her	1
shoulder	1
obliged	1
Anne	1
to	1
turn	1
round.	1
It	1
came	1
from	1
Mr	1
Elliot.	1
He	1
begged	1
her	1
pardon,	1
but	1
she	1
must	1
be	1
applied	1
to,	1
to	1
explain	1
Italian	1
again.	1
Miss	1
Carteret	1
was	1
very	1
anxious	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
general	1
idea	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
next	1
to	1
be	1
sung.	1
Anne	1
could	1
not	1
refuse;	1
but	1
never	1
had	1
she	1
sacrificed	1
to	1
politeness	1
with	1
a	1
more	1
suffering	1
spirit.	1
A	1
few	1
minutes,	1
though	1
as	1
few	1
as	1
possible,	1
were	1
inevitably	1
consumed;	1
and	1
when	1
her	1
own	1
mistress	1
again,	1
when	1
able	1
to	1
turn	1
and	1
look	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
done	1
before,	1
she	1
found	1
herself	1
accosted	1
by	1
Captain	1
Wentworth,	1
in	1
a	1
reserved	1
yet	1
hurried	1
sort	1
of	1
farewell.	1
"He	1
must	1
wish	1
her	1
good	1
night;	1
he	1
was	1
going;	1
he	1
should	1
get	1
home	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
he	1
could."	1
"Is	1
not	1
this	1
song	1
worth	1
staying	1
for?"	1
said	1
Anne,	1
suddenly	1
struck	1
by	1
an	1
idea	1
which	1
made	1
her	1
yet	1
more	1
anxious	1
to	1
be	1
encouraging.	1
"No!"	1
he	1
replied	1
impressively,	1
"there	1
is	1
nothing	1
worth	1
my	1
staying	1
for;"	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
gone	1
directly.	1
Jealousy	1
of	1
Mr	1
Elliot!	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
intelligible	1
motive.	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
jealous	1
of	1
her	1
affection!	1
Could	1
she	1
have	1
believed	1
it	1
a	1
week	1
ago;	1
three	1
hours	1
ago!	1
For	1
a	1
moment	1
the	1
gratification	1
was	1
exquisite.	1
But,	1
alas!	1
there	1
were	1
very	1
different	1
thoughts	1
to	1
succeed.	1
How	1
was	1
such	1
jealousy	1
to	1
be	1
quieted?	1
How	1
was	1
the	1
truth	1
to	1
reach	1
him?	1
How,	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
peculiar	1
disadvantages	1
of	1
their	1
respective	1
situations,	1
would	1
he	1
ever	1
learn	1
of	1
her	1
real	1
sentiments?	1
It	1
was	1
misery	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
Mr	1
Elliot's	1
attentions.	1
Their	1
evil	1
was	1
incalculable.	1
Chapter	1
21	1
Anne	1
recollected	1
with	1
pleasure	1
the	1
next	1
morning	1
her	1
promise	1
of	1
going	1
to	1
Mrs	1
Smith,	1
meaning	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
engage	1
her	1
from	1
home	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
when	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
would	1
be	1
most	1
likely	1
to	1
call;	1
for	1
to	1
avoid	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
was	1
almost	1
a	1
first	1
object.	1
She	1
felt	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
good-will	1
towards	1
him.	1
In	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
mischief	1
of	1
his	1
attentions,	1
she	1
owed	1
him	1
gratitude	1
and	1
regard,	1
perhaps	1
compassion.	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
thinking	1
much	1
of	1
the	1
extraordinary	1
circumstances	1
attending	1
their	1
acquaintance,	1
of	1
the	1
right	1
which	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
to	1
interest	1
her,	1
by	1
everything	1
in	1
situation,	1
by	1
his	1
own	1
sentiments,	1
by	1
his	1
early	1
prepossession.	1
It	1
was	1
altogether	1
very	1
extraordinary;	1
flattering,	1
but	1
painful.	1
There	1
was	1
much	1
to	1
regret.	1
How	1
she	1
might	1
have	1
felt	1
had	1
there	1
been	1
no	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
in	1
the	1
case,	1
was	1
not	1
worth	1
enquiry;	1
for	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
Captain	1
Wentworth;	1
and	1
be	1
the	1
conclusion	1
of	1
the	1
present	1
suspense	1
good	1
or	1
bad,	1
her	1
affection	1
would	1
be	1
his	1
for	1
ever.	1
Their	1
union,	1
she	1
believed,	1
could	1
not	1
divide	1
her	1
more	1
from	1
other	1
men,	1
than	1
their	1
final	1
separation.	1
Prettier	1
musings	1
of	1
high-wrought	1
love	1
and	1
eternal	1
constancy,	1
could	1
never	1
have	1
passed	1
along	1
the	1
streets	1
of	1
Bath,	1
than	1
Anne	1
was	1
sporting	1
with	1
from	1
Camden	1
Place	1
to	1
Westgate	1
Buildings.	1
It	1
was	1
almost	1
enough	1
to	1
spread	1
purification	1
and	1
perfume	1
all	1
the	1
way.	1
She	1
was	1
sure	1
of	1
a	1
pleasant	1
reception;	1
and	1
her	1
friend	1
seemed	1
this	1
morning	1
particularly	1
obliged	1
to	1
her	1
for	1
coming,	1
seemed	1
hardly	1
to	1
have	1
expected	1
her,	1
though	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
an	1
appointment.	1
An	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
concert	1
was	1
immediately	1
claimed;	1
and	1
Anne's	1
recollections	1
of	1
the	1
concert	1
were	1
quite	1
happy	1
enough	1
to	1
animate	1
her	1
features	1
and	1
make	1
her	1
rejoice	1
to	1
talk	1
of	1
it.	1
All	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
tell	1
she	1
told	1
most	1
gladly,	1
but	1
the	1
all	1
was	1
little	1
for	1
one	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
there,	1
and	1
unsatisfactory	1
for	1
such	1
an	1
enquirer	1
as	1
Mrs	1
Smith,	1
who	1
had	1
already	1
heard,	1
through	1
the	1
short	1
cut	1
of	1
a	1
laundress	1
and	1
a	1
waiter,	1
rather	1
more	1
of	1
the	1
general	1
success	1
and	1
produce	1
of	1
the	1
evening	1
than	1
Anne	1
could	1
relate,	1
and	1
who	1
now	1
asked	1
in	1
vain	1
for	1
several	1
particulars	1
of	1
the	1
company.	1
Everybody	1
of	1
any	1
consequence	1
or	1
notoriety	1
in	1
Bath	1
was	1
well	1
know	1
by	1
name	1
to	1
Mrs	1
Smith.	1
"The	1
little	1
Durands	1
were	1
there,	1
I	1
conclude,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"with	1
their	1
mouths	1
open	1
to	1
catch	1
the	1
music,	1
like	1
unfledged	1
sparrows	1
ready	1
to	1
be	1
fed.	1
They	1
never	1
miss	1
a	1
concert."	1
"Yes;	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
them	1
myself,	1
but	1
I	1
heard	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
say	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
room."	1
"The	1
Ibbotsons,	1
were	1
they	1
there?	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
new	1
beauties,	1
with	1
the	1
tall	1
Irish	1
officer,	1
who	1
is	1
talked	1
of	1
for	1
one	1
of	1
them."	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
know.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
they	1
were."	1
"Old	1
Lady	1
Mary	1
Maclean?	1
I	1
need	1
not	1
ask	1
after	1
her.	1
She	1
never	1
misses,	1
I	1
know;	1
and	1
you	1
must	1
have	1
seen	1
her.	1
She	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
your	1
own	1
circle;	1
for	1
as	1
you	1
went	1
with	1
Lady	1
Dalrymple,	1
you	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
seats	1
of	1
grandeur,	1
round	1
the	1
orchestra,	1
of	1
course."	1
"No,	1
that	1
was	1
what	1
I	1
dreaded.	1
It	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
very	1
unpleasant	1
to	1
me	1
in	1
every	1
respect.	1
But	1
happily	1
Lady	1
Dalrymple	1
always	1
chooses	1
to	1
be	1
farther	1
off;	1
and	1
we	1
were	1
exceedingly	1
well	1
placed,	1
that	1
is,	1
for	1
hearing;	1
I	1
must	1
not	1
say	1
for	1
seeing,	1
because	1
I	1
appear	1
to	1
have	1
seen	1
very	1
little."	1
"Oh!	1
you	1
saw	1
enough	1
for	1
your	1
own	1
amusement.	1
I	1
can	1
understand.	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
domestic	1
enjoyment	1
to	1
be	1
known	1
even	1
in	1
a	1
crowd,	1
and	1
this	1
you	1
had.	1
You	1
were	1
a	1
large	1
party	1
in	1
yourselves,	1
and	1
you	1
wanted	1
nothing	1
beyond."	1
"But	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
looked	1
about	1
me	1
more,"	1
said	1
Anne,	1
conscious	1
while	1
she	1
spoke	1
that	1
there	1
had	1
in	1
fact	1
been	1
no	1
want	1
of	1
looking	1
about,	1
that	1
the	1
object	1
only	1
had	1
been	1
deficient.	1
"No,	1
no;	1
you	1
were	1
better	1
employed.	1
You	1
need	1
not	1
tell	1
me	1
that	1
you	1
had	1
a	1
pleasant	1
evening.	1
I	1
see	1
it	1
in	1
your	1
eye.	1
I	1
perfectly	1
see	1
how	1
the	1
hours	1
passed:	1
that	1
you	1
had	1
always	1
something	1
agreeable	1
to	1
listen	1
to.	1
In	1
the	1
intervals	1
of	1
the	1
concert	1
it	1
was	1
conversation."	1
Anne	1
half	1
smiled	1
and	1
said,	1
"Do	1
you	1
see	1
that	1
in	1
my	1
eye?"	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
do.	1
Your	1
countenance	1
perfectly	1
informs	1
me	1
that	1
you	1
were	1
in	1
company	1
last	1
night	1
with	1
the	1
person	1
whom	1
you	1
think	1
the	1
most	1
agreeable	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
the	1
person	1
who	1
interests	1
you	1
at	1
this	1
present	1
time	1
more	1
than	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
put	1
together."	1
A	1
blush	1
overspread	1
Anne's	1
cheeks.	1
She	1
could	1
say	1
nothing.	1
"And	1
such	1
being	1
the	1
case,"	1
continued	1
Mrs	1
Smith,	1
after	1
a	1
short	1
pause,	1
"I	1
hope	1
you	1
believe	1
that	1
I	1
do	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
value	1
your	1
kindness	1
in	1
coming	1
to	1
me	1
this	1
morning.	1
It	1
is	1
really	1
very	1
good	1
of	1
you	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
sit	1
with	1
me,	1
when	1
you	1
must	1
have	1
so	1
many	1
pleasanter	1
demands	1
upon	1
your	1
time."	1
Anne	1
heard	1
nothing	1
of	1
this.	1
She	1
was	1
still	1
in	1
the	1
astonishment	1
and	1
confusion	1
excited	1
by	1
her	1
friend's	1
penetration,	1
unable	1
to	1
imagine	1
how	1
any	1
report	1
of	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
could	1
have	1
reached	1
her.	1
After	1
another	1
short	1
silence--	1
"Pray,"	1
said	1
Mrs	1
Smith,	1
"is	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
aware	1
of	1
your	1
acquaintance	1
with	1
me?	1
Does	1
he	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
Bath?"	1
"Mr	1
Elliot!"	1
repeated	1
Anne,	1
looking	1
up	1
surprised.	1
A	1
moment's	1
reflection	1
shewed	1
her	1
the	1
mistake	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
under.	1
She	1
caught	1
it	1
instantaneously;	1
and	1
recovering	1
her	1
courage	1
with	1
the	1
feeling	1
of	1
safety,	1
soon	1
added,	1
more	1
composedly,	1
"Are	1
you	1
acquainted	1
with	1
Mr	1
Elliot?"	1
"I	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
acquainted	1
with	1
him,"	1
replied	1
Mrs	1
Smith,	1
gravely,	1
"but	1
it	1
seems	1
worn	1
out	1
now.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
while	1
since	1
we	1
met."	1
"I	1
was	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
aware	1
of	1
this.	1
You	1
never	1
mentioned	1
it	1
before.	1
Had	1
I	1
known	1
it,	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
had	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
talking	1
to	1
him	1
about	1
you."	1
"To	1
confess	1
the	1
truth,"	1
said	1
Mrs	1
Smith,	1
assuming	1
her	1
usual	1
air	1
of	1
cheerfulness,	1
"that	1
is	1
exactly	1
the	1
pleasure	1
I	1
want	1
you	1
to	1
have.	1
I	1
want	1
you	1
to	1
talk	1
about	1
me	1
to	1
Mr	1
Elliot.	1
I	1
want	1
your	1
interest	1
with	1
him.	1
He	1
can	1
be	1
of	1
essential	1
service	1
to	1
me;	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
the	1
goodness,	1
my	1
dear	1
Miss	1
Elliot,	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
an	1
object	1
to	1
yourself,	1
of	1
course	1
it	1
is	1
done."	1
"I	1
should	1
be	1
extremely	1
happy;	1
I	1
hope	1
you	1
cannot	1
doubt	1
my	1
willingness	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
even	1
the	1
slightest	1
use	1
to	1
you,"	1
replied	1
Anne;	1
"but	1
I	1
suspect	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
considering	1
me	1
as	1
having	1
a	1
higher	1
claim	1
on	1
Mr	1
Elliot,	1
a	1
greater	1
right	1
to	1
influence	1
him,	1
than	1
is	1
really	1
the	1
case.	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
you	1
have,	1
somehow	1
or	1
other,	1
imbibed	1
such	1
a	1
notion.	1
You	1
must	1
consider	1
me	1
only	1
as	1
Mr	1
Elliot's	1
relation.	1
If	1
in	1
that	1
light	1
there	1
is	1
anything	1
which	1
you	1
suppose	1
his	1
cousin	1
might	1
fairly	1
ask	1
of	1
him,	1
I	1
beg	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
hesitate	1
to	1
employ	1
me."	1
Mrs	1
Smith	1
gave	1
her	1
a	1
penetrating	1
glance,	1
and	1
then,	1
smiling,	1
said--	1
"I	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
little	1
premature,	1
I	1
perceive;	1
I	1
beg	1
your	1
pardon.	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
waited	1
for	1
official	1
information,	1
But	1
now,	1
my	1
dear	1
Miss	1
Elliot,	1
as	1
an	1
old	1
friend,	1
do	1
give	1
me	1
a	1
hint	1
as	1
to	1
when	1
I	1
may	1
speak.	1
Next	1
week?	1
To	1
be	1
sure	1
by	1
next	1
week	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
allowed	1
to	1
think	1
it	1
all	1
settled,	1
and	1
build	1
my	1
own	1
selfish	1
schemes	1
on	1
Mr	1
Elliot's	1
good	1
fortune."	1
"No,"	1
replied	1
Anne,	1
"nor	1
next	1
week,	1
nor	1
next,	1
nor	1
next.	1
I	1
assure	1
you	1
that	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
sort	1
you	1
are	1
thinking	1
of	1
will	1
be	1
settled	1
any	1
week.	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
going	1
to	1
marry	1
Mr	1
Elliot.	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
know	1
why	1
you	1
imagine	1
I	1
am?"	1
Mrs	1
Smith	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
again,	1
looked	1
earnestly,	1
smiled,	1
shook	1
her	1
head,	1
and	1
exclaimed--	1
"Now,	1
how	1
I	1
do	1
wish	1
I	1
understood	1
you!	1
How	1
I	1
do	1
wish	1
I	1
knew	1
what	1
you	1
were	1
at!	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
great	1
idea	1
that	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
design	1
to	1
be	1
cruel,	1
when	1
the	1
right	1
moment	1
occurs.	1
Till	1
it	1
does	1
come,	1
you	1
know,	1
we	1
women	1
never	1
mean	1
to	1
have	1
anybody.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
thing	1
of	1
course	1
among	1
us,	1
that	1
every	1
man	1
is	1
refused,	1
till	1
he	1
offers.	1
But	1
why	1
should	1
you	1
be	1
cruel?	1
Let	1
me	1
plead	1
for	1
my--present	1
friend	1
I	1
cannot	1
call	1
him,	1
but	1
for	1
my	1
former	1
friend.	1
Where	1
can	1
you	1
look	1
for	1
a	1
more	1
suitable	1
match?	1
Where	1
could	1
you	1
expect	1
a	1
more	1
gentlemanlike,	1
agreeable	1
man?	1
Let	1
me	1
recommend	1
Mr	1
Elliot.	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
you	1
hear	1
nothing	1
but	1
good	1
of	1
him	1
from	1
Colonel	1
Wallis;	1
and	1
who	1
can	1
know	1
him	1
better	1
than	1
Colonel	1
Wallis?"	1
"My	1
dear	1
Mrs	1
Smith,	1
Mr	1
Elliot's	1
wife	1
has	1
not	1
been	1
dead	1
much	1
above	1
half	1
a	1
year.	1
He	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
supposed	1
to	1
be	1
paying	1
his	1
addresses	1
to	1
any	1
one."	1
"Oh!	1
if	1
these	1
are	1
your	1
only	1
objections,"	1
cried	1
Mrs	1
Smith,	1
archly,	1
"Mr	1
Elliot	1
is	1
safe,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
give	1
myself	1
no	1
more	1
trouble	1
about	1
him.	1
Do	1
not	1
forget	1
me	1
when	1
you	1
are	1
married,	1
that's	1
all.	1
Let	1
him	1
know	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
friend	1
of	1
yours,	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
will	1
think	1
little	1
of	1
the	1
trouble	1
required,	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
natural	1
for	1
him	1
now,	1
with	1
so	1
many	1
affairs	1
and	1
engagements	1
of	1
his	1
own,	1
to	1
avoid	1
and	1
get	1
rid	1
of	1
as	1
he	1
can;	1
very	1
natural,	1
perhaps.	1
Ninety-nine	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
hundred	1
would	1
do	1
the	1
same.	1
Of	1
course,	1
he	1
cannot	1
be	1
aware	1
of	1
the	1
importance	1
to	1
me.	1
Well,	1
my	1
dear	1
Miss	1
Elliot,	1
I	1
hope	1
and	1
trust	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
very	1
happy.	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
has	1
sense	1
to	1
understand	1
the	1
value	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
woman.	1
Your	1
peace	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
shipwrecked	1
as	1
mine	1
has	1
been.	1
You	1
are	1
safe	1
in	1
all	1
worldly	1
matters,	1
and	1
safe	1
in	1
his	1
character.	1
He	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
led	1
astray;	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
misled	1
by	1
others	1
to	1
his	1
ruin."	1
"No,"	1
said	1
Anne,	1
"I	1
can	1
readily	1
believe	1
all	1
that	1
of	1
my	1
cousin.	1
He	1
seems	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
calm	1
decided	1
temper,	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
open	1
to	1
dangerous	1
impressions.	1
I	1
consider	1
him	1
with	1
great	1
respect.	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
reason,	1
from	1
any	1
thing	1
that	1
has	1
fallen	1
within	1
my	1
observation,	1
to	1
do	1
otherwise.	1
But	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
known	1
him	1
long;	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
man,	1
I	1
think,	1
to	1
be	1
known	1
intimately	1
soon.	1
Will	1
not	1
this	1
manner	1
of	1
speaking	1
of	1
him,	1
Mrs	1
Smith,	1
convince	1
you	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
nothing	1
to	1
me?	1
Surely	1
this	1
must	1
be	1
calm	1
enough.	1
And,	1
upon	1
my	1
word,	1
he	1
is	1
nothing	1
to	1
me.	1
Should	1
he	1
ever	1
propose	1
to	1
me	1
(which	1
I	1
have	1
very	1
little	1
reason	1
to	1
imagine	1
he	1
has	1
any	1
thought	1
of	1
doing),	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
accept	1
him.	1
I	1
assure	1
you	1
I	1
shall	1
not.	1
I	1
assure	1
you,	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
share	1
which	1
you	1
have	1
been	1
supposing,	1
in	1
whatever	1
pleasure	1
the	1
concert	1
of	1
last	1
night	1
might	1
afford:	1
not	1
Mr	1
Elliot;	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
that--"	1
She	1
stopped,	1
regretting	1
with	1
a	1
deep	1
blush	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
implied	1
so	1
much;	1
but	1
less	1
would	1
hardly	1
have	1
been	1
sufficient.	1
Mrs	1
Smith	1
would	1
hardly	1
have	1
believed	1
so	1
soon	1
in	1
Mr	1
Elliot's	1
failure,	1
but	1
from	1
the	1
perception	1
of	1
there	1
being	1
a	1
somebody	1
else.	1
As	1
it	1
was,	1
she	1
instantly	1
submitted,	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
semblance	1
of	1
seeing	1
nothing	1
beyond;	1
and	1
Anne,	1
eager	1
to	1
escape	1
farther	1
notice,	1
was	1
impatient	1
to	1
know	1
why	1
Mrs	1
Smith	1
should	1
have	1
fancied	1
she	1
was	1
to	1
marry	1
Mr	1
Elliot;	1
where	1
she	1
could	1
have	1
received	1
the	1
idea,	1
or	1
from	1
whom	1
she	1
could	1
have	1
heard	1
it.	1
"Do	1
tell	1
me	1
how	1
it	1
first	1
came	1
into	1
your	1
head."	1
"It	1
first	1
came	1
into	1
my	1
head,"	1
replied	1
Mrs	1
Smith,	1
"upon	1
finding	1
how	1
much	1
you	1
were	1
together,	1
and	1
feeling	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
most	1
probable	1
thing	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
be	1
wished	1
for	1
by	1
everybody	1
belonging	1
to	1
either	1
of	1
you;	1
and	1
you	1
may	1
depend	1
upon	1
it	1
that	1
all	1
your	1
acquaintance	1
have	1
disposed	1
of	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way.	1
But	1
I	1
never	1
heard	1
it	1
spoken	1
of	1
till	1
two	1
days	1
ago."	1
"And	1
has	1
it	1
indeed	1
been	1
spoken	1
of?"	1
"Did	1
you	1
observe	1
the	1
woman	1
who	1
opened	1
the	1
door	1
to	1
you	1
when	1
you	1
called	1
yesterday?"	1
"No.	1
Was	1
not	1
it	1
Mrs	1
Speed,	1
as	1
usual,	1
or	1
the	1
maid?	1
I	1
observed	1
no	1
one	1
in	1
particular."	1
"It	1
was	1
my	1
friend	1
Mrs	1
Rooke;	1
Nurse	1
Rooke;	1
who,	1
by-the-bye,	1
had	1
a	1
great	1
curiosity	1
to	1
see	1
you,	1
and	1
was	1
delighted	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
let	1
you	1
in.	1
She	1
came	1
away	1
from	1
Marlborough	1
Buildings	1
only	1
on	1
Sunday;	1
and	1
she	1
it	1
was	1
who	1
told	1
me	1
you	1
were	1
to	1
marry	1
Mr	1
Elliot.	1
She	1
had	1
had	1
it	1
from	1
Mrs	1
Wallis	1
herself,	1
which	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
bad	1
authority.	1
She	1
sat	1
an	1
hour	1
with	1
me	1
on	1
Monday	1
evening,	1
and	1
gave	1
me	1
the	1
whole	1
history."	1
"The	1
whole	1
history,"	1
repeated	1
Anne,	1
laughing.	1
"She	1
could	1
not	1
make	1
a	1
very	1
long	1
history,	1
I	1
think,	1
of	1
one	1
such	1
little	1
article	1
of	1
unfounded	1
news."	1
Mrs	1
Smith	1
said	1
nothing.	1
"But,"	1
continued	1
Anne,	1
presently,	1
"though	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
truth	1
in	1
my	1
having	1
this	1
claim	1
on	1
Mr	1
Elliot,	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
extremely	1
happy	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
use	1
to	1
you	1
in	1
any	1
way	1
that	1
I	1
could.	1
Shall	1
I	1
mention	1
to	1
him	1
your	1
being	1
in	1
Bath?	1
Shall	1
I	1
take	1
any	1
message?"	1
"No,	1
I	1
thank	1
you:	1
no,	1
certainly	1
not.	1
In	1
the	1
warmth	1
of	1
the	1
moment,	1
and	1
under	1
a	1
mistaken	1
impression,	1
I	1
might,	1
perhaps,	1
have	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
interest	1
you	1
in	1
some	1
circumstances;	1
but	1
not	1
now.	1
No,	1
I	1
thank	1
you,	1
I	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
trouble	1
you	1
with."	1
"I	1
think	1
you	1
spoke	1
of	1
having	1
known	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
many	1
years?"	1
"I	1
did."	1
"Not	1
before	1
he	1
was	1
married,	1
I	1
suppose?"	1
"Yes;	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
married	1
when	1
I	1
knew	1
him	1
first."	1
"And--were	1
you	1
much	1
acquainted?"	1
"Intimately."	1
"Indeed!	1
Then	1
do	1
tell	1
me	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
of	1
life.	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
great	1
curiosity	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
was	1
as	1
a	1
very	1
young	1
man.	1
Was	1
he	1
at	1
all	1
such	1
as	1
he	1
appears	1
now?"	1
"I	1
have	1
not	1
seen	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
these	1
three	1
years,"	1
was	1
Mrs	1
Smith's	1
answer,	1
given	1
so	1
gravely	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
pursue	1
the	1
subject	1
farther;	1
and	1
Anne	1
felt	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
gained	1
nothing	1
but	1
an	1
increase	1
of	1
curiosity.	1
They	1
were	1
both	1
silent:	1
Mrs	1
Smith	1
very	1
thoughtful.	1
At	1
last--	1
"I	1
beg	1
your	1
pardon,	1
my	1
dear	1
Miss	1
Elliot,"	1
she	1
cried,	1
in	1
her	1
natural	1
tone	1
of	1
cordiality,	1
"I	1
beg	1
your	1
pardon	1
for	1
the	1
short	1
answers	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
giving	1
you,	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
uncertain	1
what	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
do.	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
doubting	1
and	1
considering	1
as	1
to	1
what	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
tell	1
you.	1
There	1
were	1
many	1
things	1
to	1
be	1
taken	1
into	1
the	1
account.	1
One	1
hates	1
to	1
be	1
officious,	1
to	1
be	1
giving	1
bad	1
impressions,	1
making	1
mischief.	1
Even	1
the	1
smooth	1
surface	1
of	1
family-union	1
seems	1
worth	1
preserving,	1
though	1
there	1
may	1
be	1
nothing	1
durable	1
beneath.	1
However,	1
I	1
have	1
determined;	1
I	1
think	1
I	1
am	1
right;	1
I	1
think	1
you	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
made	1
acquainted	1
with	1
Mr	1
Elliot's	1
real	1
character.	1
Though	1
I	1
fully	1
believe	1
that,	1
at	1
present,	1
you	1
have	1
not	1
the	1
smallest	1
intention	1
of	1
accepting	1
him,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
saying	1
what	1
may	1
happen.	1
You	1
might,	1
some	1
time	1
or	1
other,	1
be	1
differently	1
affected	1
towards	1
him.	1
Hear	1
the	1
truth,	1
therefore,	1
now,	1
while	1
you	1
are	1
unprejudiced.	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
is	1
a	1
man	1
without	1
heart	1
or	1
conscience;	1
a	1
designing,	1
wary,	1
cold-blooded	1
being,	1
who	1
thinks	1
only	1
of	1
himself;	1
whom	1
for	1
his	1
own	1
interest	1
or	1
ease,	1
would	1
be	1
guilty	1
of	1
any	1
cruelty,	1
or	1
any	1
treachery,	1
that	1
could	1
be	1
perpetrated	1
without	1
risk	1
of	1
his	1
general	1
character.	1
He	1
has	1
no	1
feeling	1
for	1
others.	1
Those	1
whom	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
the	1
chief	1
cause	1
of	1
leading	1
into	1
ruin,	1
he	1
can	1
neglect	1
and	1
desert	1
without	1
the	1
smallest	1
compunction.	1
He	1
is	1
totally	1
beyond	1
the	1
reach	1
of	1
any	1
sentiment	1
of	1
justice	1
or	1
compassion.	1
Oh!	1
he	1
is	1
black	1
at	1
heart,	1
hollow	1
and	1
black!"	1
Anne's	1
astonished	1
air,	1
and	1
exclamation	1
of	1
wonder,	1
made	1
her	1
pause,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
calmer	1
manner,	1
she	1
added,	1
"My	1
expressions	1
startle	1
you.	1
You	1
must	1
allow	1
for	1
an	1
injured,	1
angry	1
woman.	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
try	1
to	1
command	1
myself.	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
abuse	1
him.	1
I	1
will	1
only	1
tell	1
you	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
him.	1
Facts	1
shall	1
speak.	1
He	1
was	1
the	1
intimate	1
friend	1
of	1
my	1
dear	1
husband,	1
who	1
trusted	1
and	1
loved	1
him,	1
and	1
thought	1
him	1
as	1
good	1
as	1
himself.	1
The	1
intimacy	1
had	1
been	1
formed	1
before	1
our	1
marriage.	1
I	1
found	1
them	1
most	1
intimate	1
friends;	1
and	1
I,	1
too,	1
became	1
excessively	1
pleased	1
with	1
Mr	1
Elliot,	1
and	1
entertained	1
the	1
highest	1
opinion	1
of	1
him.	1
At	1
nineteen,	1
you	1
know,	1
one	1
does	1
not	1
think	1
very	1
seriously;	1
but	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
appeared	1
to	1
me	1
quite	1
as	1
good	1
as	1
others,	1
and	1
much	1
more	1
agreeable	1
than	1
most	1
others,	1
and	1
we	1
were	1
almost	1
always	1
together.	1
We	1
were	1
principally	1
in	1
town,	1
living	1
in	1
very	1
good	1
style.	1
He	1
was	1
then	1
the	1
inferior	1
in	1
circumstances;	1
he	1
was	1
then	1
the	1
poor	1
one;	1
he	1
had	1
chambers	1
in	1
the	1
Temple,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
do	1
to	1
support	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
a	1
gentleman.	1
He	1
had	1
always	1
a	1
home	1
with	1
us	1
whenever	1
he	1
chose	1
it;	1
he	1
was	1
always	1
welcome;	1
he	1
was	1
like	1
a	1
brother.	1
My	1
poor	1
Charles,	1
who	1
had	1
the	1
finest,	1
most	1
generous	1
spirit	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
would	1
have	1
divided	1
his	1
last	1
farthing	1
with	1
him;	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
his	1
purse	1
was	1
open	1
to	1
him;	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
he	1
often	1
assisted	1
him."	1
"This	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
about	1
that	1
very	1
period	1
of	1
Mr	1
Elliot's	1
life,"	1
said	1
Anne,	1
"which	1
has	1
always	1
excited	1
my	1
particular	1
curiosity.	1
It	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
about	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
that	1
he	1
became	1
known	1
to	1
my	1
father	1
and	1
sister.	1
I	1
never	1
knew	1
him	1
myself;	1
I	1
only	1
heard	1
of	1
him;	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
something	1
in	1
his	1
conduct	1
then,	1
with	1
regard	1
to	1
my	1
father	1
and	1
sister,	1
and	1
afterwards	1
in	1
the	1
circumstances	1
of	1
his	1
marriage,	1
which	1
I	1
never	1
could	1
quite	1
reconcile	1
with	1
present	1
times.	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
announce	1
a	1
different	1
sort	1
of	1
man."	1
"I	1
know	1
it	1
all,	1
I	1
know	1
it	1
all,"	1
cried	1
Mrs	1
Smith.	1
"He	1
had	1
been	1
introduced	1
to	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
and	1
your	1
sister	1
before	1
I	1
was	1
acquainted	1
with	1
him,	1
but	1
I	1
heard	1
him	1
speak	1
of	1
them	1
for	1
ever.	1
I	1
know	1
he	1
was	1
invited	1
and	1
encouraged,	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
choose	1
to	1
go.	1
I	1
can	1
satisfy	1
you,	1
perhaps,	1
on	1
points	1
which	1
you	1
would	1
little	1
expect;	1
and	1
as	1
to	1
his	1
marriage,	1
I	1
knew	1
all	1
about	1
it	1
at	1
the	1
time.	1
I	1
was	1
privy	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
fors	1
and	1
againsts;	1
I	1
was	1
the	1
friend	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
confided	1
his	1
hopes	1
and	1
plans;	1
and	1
though	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
his	1
wife	1
previously,	1
her	1
inferior	1
situation	1
in	1
society,	1
indeed,	1
rendered	1
that	1
impossible,	1
yet	1
I	1
knew	1
her	1
all	1
her	1
life	1
afterwards,	1
or	1
at	1
least	1
till	1
within	1
the	1
last	1
two	1
years	1
of	1
her	1
life,	1
and	1
can	1
answer	1
any	1
question	1
you	1
may	1
wish	1
to	1
put."	1
"Nay,"	1
said	1
Anne,	1
"I	1
have	1
no	1
particular	1
enquiry	1
to	1
make	1
about	1
her.	1
I	1
have	1
always	1
understood	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
a	1
happy	1
couple.	1
But	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
know	1
why,	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
of	1
his	1
life,	1
he	1
should	1
slight	1
my	1
father's	1
acquaintance	1
as	1
he	1
did.	1
My	1
father	1
was	1
certainly	1
disposed	1
to	1
take	1
very	1
kind	1
and	1
proper	1
notice	1
of	1
him.	1
Why	1
did	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
draw	1
back?"	1
"Mr	1
Elliot,"	1
replied	1
Mrs	1
Smith,	1
"at	1
that	1
period	1
of	1
his	1
life,	1
had	1
one	1
object	1
in	1
view:	1
to	1
make	1
his	1
fortune,	1
and	1
by	1
a	1
rather	1
quicker	1
process	1
than	1
the	1
law.	1
He	1
was	1
determined	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
by	1
marriage.	1
He	1
was	1
determined,	1
at	1
least,	1
not	1
to	1
mar	1
it	1
by	1
an	1
imprudent	1
marriage;	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
it	1
was	1
his	1
belief	1
(whether	1
justly	1
or	1
not,	1
of	1
course	1
I	1
cannot	1
decide),	1
that	1
your	1
father	1
and	1
sister,	1
in	1
their	1
civilities	1
and	1
invitations,	1
were	1
designing	1
a	1
match	1
between	1
the	1
heir	1
and	1
the	1
young	1
lady,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
that	1
such	1
a	1
match	1
should	1
have	1
answered	1
his	1
ideas	1
of	1
wealth	1
and	1
independence.	1
That	1
was	1
his	1
motive	1
for	1
drawing	1
back,	1
I	1
can	1
assure	1
you.	1
He	1
told	1
me	1
the	1
whole	1
story.	1
He	1
had	1
no	1
concealments	1
with	1
me.	1
It	1
was	1
curious,	1
that	1
having	1
just	1
left	1
you	1
behind	1
me	1
in	1
Bath,	1
my	1
first	1
and	1
principal	1
acquaintance	1
on	1
marrying	1
should	1
be	1
your	1
cousin;	1
and	1
that,	1
through	1
him,	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
continually	1
hearing	1
of	1
your	1
father	1
and	1
sister.	1
He	1
described	1
one	1
Miss	1
Elliot,	1
and	1
I	1
thought	1
very	1
affectionately	1
of	1
the	1
other."	1
"Perhaps,"	1
cried	1
Anne,	1
struck	1
by	1
a	1
sudden	1
idea,	1
"you	1
sometimes	1
spoke	1
of	1
me	1
to	1
Mr	1
Elliot?"	1
"To	1
be	1
sure	1
I	1
did;	1
very	1
often.	1
I	1
used	1
to	1
boast	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
Anne	1
Elliot,	1
and	1
vouch	1
for	1
your	1
being	1
a	1
very	1
different	1
creature	1
from--"	1
She	1
checked	1
herself	1
just	1
in	1
time.	1
"This	1
accounts	1
for	1
something	1
which	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
said	1
last	1
night,"	1
cried	1
Anne.	1
"This	1
explains	1
it.	1
I	1
found	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
used	1
to	1
hear	1
of	1
me.	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
comprehend	1
how.	1
What	1
wild	1
imaginations	1
one	1
forms	1
where	1
dear	1
self	1
is	1
concerned!	1
How	1
sure	1
to	1
be	1
mistaken!	1
But	1
I	1
beg	1
your	1
pardon;	1
I	1
have	1
interrupted	1
you.	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
married	1
then	1
completely	1
for	1
money?	1
The	1
circumstances,	1
probably,	1
which	1
first	1
opened	1
your	1
eyes	1
to	1
his	1
character."	1
Mrs	1
Smith	1
hesitated	1
a	1
little	1
here.	1
"Oh!	1
those	1
things	1
are	1
too	1
common.	1
When	1
one	1
lives	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
a	1
man	1
or	1
woman's	1
marrying	1
for	1
money	1
is	1
too	1
common	1
to	1
strike	1
one	1
as	1
it	1
ought.	1
I	1
was	1
very	1
young,	1
and	1
associated	1
only	1
with	1
the	1
young,	1
and	1
we	1
were	1
a	1
thoughtless,	1
gay	1
set,	1
without	1
any	1
strict	1
rules	1
of	1
conduct.	1
We	1
lived	1
for	1
enjoyment.	1
I	1
think	1
differently	1
now;	1
time	1
and	1
sickness	1
and	1
sorrow	1
have	1
given	1
me	1
other	1
notions;	1
but	1
at	1
that	1
period	1
I	1
must	1
own	1
I	1
saw	1
nothing	1
reprehensible	1
in	1
what	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
was	1
doing.	1
`To	1
do	1
the	1
best	1
for	1
himself,'	1
passed	1
as	1
a	1
duty."	1
"But	1
was	1
not	1
she	1
a	1
very	1
low	1
woman?"	1
"Yes;	1
which	1
I	1
objected	1
to,	1
but	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
regard.	1
Money,	1
money,	1
was	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
wanted.	1
Her	1
father	1
was	1
a	1
grazier,	1
her	1
grandfather	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
butcher,	1
but	1
that	1
was	1
all	1
nothing.	1
She	1
was	1
a	1
fine	1
woman,	1
had	1
had	1
a	1
decent	1
education,	1
was	1
brought	1
forward	1
by	1
some	1
cousins,	1
thrown	1
by	1
chance	1
into	1
Mr	1
Elliot's	1
company,	1
and	1
fell	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
him;	1
and	1
not	1
a	1
difficulty	1
or	1
a	1
scruple	1
was	1
there	1
on	1
his	1
side,	1
with	1
respect	1
to	1
her	1
birth.	1
All	1
his	1
caution	1
was	1
spent	1
in	1
being	1
secured	1
of	1
the	1
real	1
amount	1
of	1
her	1
fortune,	1
before	1
he	1
committed	1
himself.	1
Depend	1
upon	1
it,	1
whatever	1
esteem	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
may	1
have	1
for	1
his	1
own	1
situation	1
in	1
life	1
now,	1
as	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
smallest	1
value	1
for	1
it.	1
His	1
chance	1
for	1
the	1
Kellynch	1
estate	1
was	1
something,	1
but	1
all	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
he	1
held	1
as	1
cheap	1
as	1
dirt.	1
I	1
have	1
often	1
heard	1
him	1
declare,	1
that	1
if	1
baronetcies	1
were	1
saleable,	1
anybody	1
should	1
have	1
his	1
for	1
fifty	1
pounds,	1
arms	1
and	1
motto,	1
name	1
and	1
livery	1
included;	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
pretend	1
to	1
repeat	1
half	1
that	1
I	1
used	1
to	1
hear	1
him	1
say	1
on	1
that	1
subject.	1
It	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
fair;	1
and	1
yet	1
you	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
proof,	1
for	1
what	1
is	1
all	1
this	1
but	1
assertion,	1
and	1
you	1
shall	1
have	1
proof."	1
"Indeed,	1
my	1
dear	1
Mrs	1
Smith,	1
I	1
want	1
none,"	1
cried	1
Anne.	1
"You	1
have	1
asserted	1
nothing	1
contradictory	1
to	1
what	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
appeared	1
to	1
be	1
some	1
years	1
ago.	1
This	1
is	1
all	1
in	1
confirmation,	1
rather,	1
of	1
what	1
we	1
used	1
to	1
hear	1
and	1
believe.	1
I	1
am	1
more	1
curious	1
to	1
know	1
why	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
so	1
different	1
now."	1
"But	1
for	1
my	1
satisfaction,	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
have	1
the	1
goodness	1
to	1
ring	1
for	1
Mary;	1
stay:	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
you	1
will	1
have	1
the	1
still	1
greater	1
goodness	1
of	1
going	1
yourself	1
into	1
my	1
bedroom,	1
and	1
bringing	1
me	1
the	1
small	1
inlaid	1
box	1
which	1
you	1
will	1
find	1
on	1
the	1
upper	1
shelf	1
of	1
the	1
closet."	1
Anne,	1
seeing	1
her	1
friend	1
to	1
be	1
earnestly	1
bent	1
on	1
it,	1
did	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
desired.	1
The	1
box	1
was	1
brought	1
and	1
placed	1
before	1
her,	1
and	1
Mrs	1
Smith,	1
sighing	1
over	1
it	1
as	1
she	1
unlocked	1
it,	1
said--	1
"This	1
is	1
full	1
of	1
papers	1
belonging	1
to	1
him,	1
to	1
my	1
husband;	1
a	1
small	1
portion	1
only	1
of	1
what	1
I	1
had	1
to	1
look	1
over	1
when	1
I	1
lost	1
him.	1
The	1
letter	1
I	1
am	1
looking	1
for	1
was	1
one	1
written	1
by	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
to	1
him	1
before	1
our	1
marriage,	1
and	1
happened	1
to	1
be	1
saved;	1
why,	1
one	1
can	1
hardly	1
imagine.	1
But	1
he	1
was	1
careless	1
and	1
immethodical,	1
like	1
other	1
men,	1
about	1
those	1
things;	1
and	1
when	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
examine	1
his	1
papers,	1
I	1
found	1
it	1
with	1
others	1
still	1
more	1
trivial,	1
from	1
different	1
people	1
scattered	1
here	1
and	1
there,	1
while	1
many	1
letters	1
and	1
memorandums	1
of	1
real	1
importance	1
had	1
been	1
destroyed.	1
Here	1
it	1
is;	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
burn	1
it,	1
because	1
being	1
even	1
then	1
very	1
little	1
satisfied	1
with	1
Mr	1
Elliot,	1
I	1
was	1
determined	1
to	1
preserve	1
every	1
document	1
of	1
former	1
intimacy.	1
I	1
have	1
now	1
another	1
motive	1
for	1
being	1
glad	1
that	1
I	1
can	1
produce	1
it."	1
This	1
was	1
the	1
letter,	1
directed	1
to	1
"Charles	1
Smith,	1
Esq.	1
Tunbridge	1
Wells,"	1
and	1
dated	1
from	1
London,	1
as	1
far	1
back	1
as	1
July,	1
1803:	1
--	1
"Dear	1
Smith,--I	1
have	1
received	1
yours.	1
Your	1
kindness	1
almost	1
overpowers	1
me.	1
I	1
wish	1
nature	1
had	1
made	1
such	1
hearts	1
as	1
yours	1
more	1
common,	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
lived	1
three-and-twenty	1
years	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
have	1
seen	1
none	1
like	1
it.	1
At	1
present,	1
believe	1
me,	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
need	1
of	1
your	1
services,	1
being	1
in	1
cash	1
again.	1
Give	1
me	1
joy:	1
I	1
have	1
got	1
rid	1
of	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
and	1
Miss.	1
They	1
are	1
gone	1
back	1
to	1
Kellynch,	1
and	1
almost	1
made	1
me	1
swear	1
to	1
visit	1
them	1
this	1
summer;	1
but	1
my	1
first	1
visit	1
to	1
Kellynch	1
will	1
be	1
with	1
a	1
surveyor,	1
to	1
tell	1
me	1
how	1
to	1
bring	1
it	1
with	1
best	1
advantage	1
to	1
the	1
hammer.	1
The	1
baronet,	1
nevertheless,	1
is	1
not	1
unlikely	1
to	1
marry	1
again;	1
he	1
is	1
quite	1
fool	1
enough.	1
If	1
he	1
does,	1
however,	1
they	1
will	1
leave	1
me	1
in	1
peace,	1
which	1
may	1
be	1
a	1
decent	1
equivalent	1
for	1
the	1
reversion.	1
He	1
is	1
worse	1
than	1
last	1
year.	1
"I	1
wish	1
I	1
had	1
any	1
name	1
but	1
Elliot.	1
I	1
am	1
sick	1
of	1
it.	1
The	1
name	1
of	1
Walter	1
I	1
can	1
drop,	1
thank	1
God!	1
and	1
I	1
desire	1
you	1
will	1
never	1
insult	1
me	1
with	1
my	1
second	1
W.	1
again,	1
meaning,	1
for	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
my	1
life,	1
to	1
be	1
only	1
yours	1
truly,--Wm.	1
Elliot."	1
Such	1
a	1
letter	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
read	1
without	1
putting	1
Anne	1
in	1
a	1
glow;	1
and	1
Mrs	1
Smith,	1
observing	1
the	1
high	1
colour	1
in	1
her	1
face,	1
said--	1
"The	1
language,	1
I	1
know,	1
is	1
highly	1
disrespectful.	1
Though	1
I	1
have	1
forgot	1
the	1
exact	1
terms,	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
perfect	1
impression	1
of	1
the	1
general	1
meaning.	1
But	1
it	1
shows	1
you	1
the	1
man.	1
Mark	1
his	1
professions	1
to	1
my	1
poor	1
husband.	1
Can	1
any	1
thing	1
be	1
stronger?"	1
Anne	1
could	1
not	1
immediately	1
get	1
over	1
the	1
shock	1
and	1
mortification	1
of	1
finding	1
such	1
words	1
applied	1
to	1
her	1
father.	1
She	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
recollect	1
that	1
her	1
seeing	1
the	1
letter	1
was	1
a	1
violation	1
of	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
honour,	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
judged	1
or	1
to	1
be	1
known	1
by	1
such	1
testimonies,	1
that	1
no	1
private	1
correspondence	1
could	1
bear	1
the	1
eye	1
of	1
others,	1
before	1
she	1
could	1
recover	1
calmness	1
enough	1
to	1
return	1
the	1
letter	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
meditating	1
over,	1
and	1
say--	1
"Thank	1
you.	1
This	1
is	1
full	1
proof	1
undoubtedly;	1
proof	1
of	1
every	1
thing	1
you	1
were	1
saying.	1
But	1
why	1
be	1
acquainted	1
with	1
us	1
now?"	1
"I	1
can	1
explain	1
this	1
too,"	1
cried	1
Mrs	1
Smith,	1
smiling.	1
"Can	1
you	1
really?"	1
"Yes.	1
I	1
have	1
shewn	1
you	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
dozen	1
years	1
ago,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
shew	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
is	1
now.	1
I	1
cannot	1
produce	1
written	1
proof	1
again,	1
but	1
I	1
can	1
give	1
as	1
authentic	1
oral	1
testimony	1
as	1
you	1
can	1
desire,	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
is	1
now	1
wanting,	1
and	1
what	1
he	1
is	1
now	1
doing.	1
He	1
is	1
no	1
hypocrite	1
now.	1
He	1
truly	1
wants	1
to	1
marry	1
you.	1
His	1
present	1
attentions	1
to	1
your	1
family	1
are	1
very	1
sincere:	1
quite	1
from	1
the	1
heart.	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
you	1
my	1
authority:	1
his	1
friend	1
Colonel	1
Wallis."	1
"Colonel	1
Wallis!	1
you	1
are	1
acquainted	1
with	1
him?"	1
"No.	1
It	1
does	1
not	1
come	1
to	1
me	1
in	1
quite	1
so	1
direct	1
a	1
line	1
as	1
that;	1
it	1
takes	1
a	1
bend	1
or	1
two,	1
but	1
nothing	1
of	1
consequence.	1
The	1
stream	1
is	1
as	1
good	1
as	1
at	1
first;	1
the	1
little	1
rubbish	1
it	1
collects	1
in	1
the	1
turnings	1
is	1
easily	1
moved	1
away.	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
talks	1
unreservedly	1
to	1
Colonel	1
Wallis	1
of	1
his	1
views	1
on	1
you,	1
which	1
said	1
Colonel	1
Wallis,	1
I	1
imagine	1
to	1
be,	1
in	1
himself,	1
a	1
sensible,	1
careful,	1
discerning	1
sort	1
of	1
character;	1
but	1
Colonel	1
Wallis	1
has	1
a	1
very	1
pretty	1
silly	1
wife,	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
tells	1
things	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
better	1
not,	1
and	1
he	1
repeats	1
it	1
all	1
to	1
her.	1
She	1
in	1
the	1
overflowing	1
spirits	1
of	1
her	1
recovery,	1
repeats	1
it	1
all	1
to	1
her	1
nurse;	1
and	1
the	1
nurse	1
knowing	1
my	1
acquaintance	1
with	1
you,	1
very	1
naturally	1
brings	1
it	1
all	1
to	1
me.	1
On	1
Monday	1
evening,	1
my	1
good	1
friend	1
Mrs	1
Rooke	1
let	1
me	1
thus	1
much	1
into	1
the	1
secrets	1
of	1
Marlborough	1
Buildings.	1
When	1
I	1
talked	1
of	1
a	1
whole	1
history,	1
therefore,	1
you	1
see	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
romancing	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
you	1
supposed."	1
"My	1
dear	1
Mrs	1
Smith,	1
your	1
authority	1
is	1
deficient.	1
This	1
will	1
not	1
do.	1
Mr	1
Elliot's	1
having	1
any	1
views	1
on	1
me	1
will	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
account	1
for	1
the	1
efforts	1
he	1
made	1
towards	1
a	1
reconciliation	1
with	1
my	1
father.	1
That	1
was	1
all	1
prior	1
to	1
my	1
coming	1
to	1
Bath.	1
I	1
found	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
most	1
friendly	1
terms	1
when	1
I	1
arrived."	1
"I	1
know	1
you	1
did;	1
I	1
know	1
it	1
all	1
perfectly,	1
but--"	1
"Indeed,	1
Mrs	1
Smith,	1
we	1
must	1
not	1
expect	1
to	1
get	1
real	1
information	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
line.	1
Facts	1
or	1
opinions	1
which	1
are	1
to	1
pass	1
through	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
so	1
many,	1
to	1
be	1
misconceived	1
by	1
folly	1
in	1
one,	1
and	1
ignorance	1
in	1
another,	1
can	1
hardly	1
have	1
much	1
truth	1
left."	1
"Only	1
give	1
me	1
a	1
hearing.	1
You	1
will	1
soon	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
judge	1
of	1
the	1
general	1
credit	1
due,	1
by	1
listening	1
to	1
some	1
particulars	1
which	1
you	1
can	1
yourself	1
immediately	1
contradict	1
or	1
confirm.	1
Nobody	1
supposes	1
that	1
you	1
were	1
his	1
first	1
inducement.	1
He	1
had	1
seen	1
you	1
indeed,	1
before	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
Bath,	1
and	1
admired	1
you,	1
but	1
without	1
knowing	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
you.	1
So	1
says	1
my	1
historian,	1
at	1
least.	1
Is	1
this	1
true?	1
Did	1
he	1
see	1
you	1
last	1
summer	1
or	1
autumn,	1
`somewhere	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
west,'	1
to	1
use	1
her	1
own	1
words,	1
without	1
knowing	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
you?"	1
"He	1
certainly	1
did.	1
So	1
far	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
true.	1
At	1
Lyme.	1
I	1
happened	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
Lyme."	1
"Well,"	1
continued	1
Mrs	1
Smith,	1
triumphantly,	1
"grant	1
my	1
friend	1
the	1
credit	1
due	1
to	1
the	1
establishment	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
point	1
asserted.	1
He	1
saw	1
you	1
then	1
at	1
Lyme,	1
and	1
liked	1
you	1
so	1
well	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
exceedingly	1
pleased	1
to	1
meet	1
with	1
you	1
again	1
in	1
Camden	1
Place,	1
as	1
Miss	1
Anne	1
Elliot,	1
and	1
from	1
that	1
moment,	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
doubt,	1
had	1
a	1
double	1
motive	1
in	1
his	1
visits	1
there.	1
But	1
there	1
was	1
another,	1
and	1
an	1
earlier,	1
which	1
I	1
will	1
now	1
explain.	1
If	1
there	1
is	1
anything	1
in	1
my	1
story	1
which	1
you	1
know	1
to	1
be	1
either	1
false	1
or	1
improbable,	1
stop	1
me.	1
My	1
account	1
states,	1
that	1
your	1
sister's	1
friend,	1
the	1
lady	1
now	1
staying	1
with	1
you,	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
you	1
mention,	1
came	1
to	1
Bath	1
with	1
Miss	1
Elliot	1
and	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
as	1
long	1
ago	1
as	1
September	1
(in	1
short	1
when	1
they	1
first	1
came	1
themselves),	1
and	1
has	1
been	1
staying	1
there	1
ever	1
since;	1
that	1
she	1
is	1
a	1
clever,	1
insinuating,	1
handsome	1
woman,	1
poor	1
and	1
plausible,	1
and	1
altogether	1
such	1
in	1
situation	1
and	1
manner,	1
as	1
to	1
give	1
a	1
general	1
idea,	1
among	1
Sir	1
Walter's	1
acquaintance,	1
of	1
her	1
meaning	1
to	1
be	1
Lady	1
Elliot,	1
and	1
as	1
general	1
a	1
surprise	1
that	1
Miss	1
Elliot	1
should	1
be	1
apparently,	1
blind	1
to	1
the	1
danger."	1
Here	1
Mrs	1
Smith	1
paused	1
a	1
moment;	1
but	1
Anne	1
had	1
not	1
a	1
word	1
to	1
say,	1
and	1
she	1
continued--	1
"This	1
was	1
the	1
light	1
in	1
which	1
it	1
appeared	1
to	1
those	1
who	1
knew	1
the	1
family,	1
long	1
before	1
you	1
returned	1
to	1
it;	1
and	1
Colonel	1
Wallis	1
had	1
his	1
eye	1
upon	1
your	1
father	1
enough	1
to	1
be	1
sensible	1
of	1
it,	1
though	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
then	1
visit	1
in	1
Camden	1
Place;	1
but	1
his	1
regard	1
for	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
gave	1
him	1
an	1
interest	1
in	1
watching	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
there,	1
and	1
when	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
came	1
to	1
Bath	1
for	1
a	1
day	1
or	1
two,	1
as	1
he	1
happened	1
to	1
do	1
a	1
little	1
before	1
Christmas,	1
Colonel	1
Wallis	1
made	1
him	1
acquainted	1
with	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
things,	1
and	1
the	1
reports	1
beginning	1
to	1
prevail.	1
Now	1
you	1
are	1
to	1
understand,	1
that	1
time	1
had	1
worked	1
a	1
very	1
material	1
change	1
in	1
Mr	1
Elliot's	1
opinions	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
value	1
of	1
a	1
baronetcy.	1
Upon	1
all	1
points	1
of	1
blood	1
and	1
connexion	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
completely	1
altered	1
man.	1
Having	1
long	1
had	1
as	1
much	1
money	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
spend,	1
nothing	1
to	1
wish	1
for	1
on	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
avarice	1
or	1
indulgence,	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
gradually	1
learning	1
to	1
pin	1
his	1
happiness	1
upon	1
the	1
consequence	1
he	1
is	1
heir	1
to.	1
I	1
thought	1
it	1
coming	1
on	1
before	1
our	1
acquaintance	1
ceased,	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
now	1
a	1
confirmed	1
feeling.	1
He	1
cannot	1
bear	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
not	1
being	1
Sir	1
William.	1
You	1
may	1
guess,	1
therefore,	1
that	1
the	1
news	1
he	1
heard	1
from	1
his	1
friend	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
very	1
agreeable,	1
and	1
you	1
may	1
guess	1
what	1
it	1
produced;	1
the	1
resolution	1
of	1
coming	1
back	1
to	1
Bath	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
possible,	1
and	1
of	1
fixing	1
himself	1
here	1
for	1
a	1
time,	1
with	1
the	1
view	1
of	1
renewing	1
his	1
former	1
acquaintance,	1
and	1
recovering	1
such	1
a	1
footing	1
in	1
the	1
family	1
as	1
might	1
give	1
him	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
ascertaining	1
the	1
degree	1
of	1
his	1
danger,	1
and	1
of	1
circumventing	1
the	1
lady	1
if	1
he	1
found	1
it	1
material.	1
This	1
was	1
agreed	1
upon	1
between	1
the	1
two	1
friends	1
as	1
the	1
only	1
thing	1
to	1
be	1
done;	1
and	1
Colonel	1
Wallis	1
was	1
to	1
assist	1
in	1
every	1
way	1
that	1
he	1
could.	1
He	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
introduced,	1
and	1
Mrs	1
Wallis	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
introduced,	1
and	1
everybody	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
introduced.	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
came	1
back	1
accordingly;	1
and	1
on	1
application	1
was	1
forgiven,	1
as	1
you	1
know,	1
and	1
re-admitted	1
into	1
the	1
family;	1
and	1
there	1
it	1
was	1
his	1
constant	1
object,	1
and	1
his	1
only	1
object	1
(till	1
your	1
arrival	1
added	1
another	1
motive),	1
to	1
watch	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
and	1
Mrs	1
Clay.	1
He	1
omitted	1
no	1
opportunity	1
of	1
being	1
with	1
them,	1
threw	1
himself	1
in	1
their	1
way,	1
called	1
at	1
all	1
hours;	1
but	1
I	1
need	1
not	1
be	1
particular	1
on	1
this	1
subject.	1
You	1
can	1
imagine	1
what	1
an	1
artful	1
man	1
would	1
do;	1
and	1
with	1
this	1
guide,	1
perhaps,	1
may	1
recollect	1
what	1
you	1
have	1
seen	1
him	1
do."	1
"Yes,"	1
said	1
Anne,	1
"you	1
tell	1
me	1
nothing	1
which	1
does	1
not	1
accord	1
with	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
known,	1
or	1
could	1
imagine.	1
There	1
is	1
always	1
something	1
offensive	1
in	1
the	1
details	1
of	1
cunning.	1
The	1
manoeuvres	1
of	1
selfishness	1
and	1
duplicity	1
must	1
ever	1
be	1
revolting,	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
nothing	1
which	1
really	1
surprises	1
me.	1
I	1
know	1
those	1
who	1
would	1
be	1
shocked	1
by	1
such	1
a	1
representation	1
of	1
Mr	1
Elliot,	1
who	1
would	1
have	1
difficulty	1
in	1
believing	1
it;	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
been	1
satisfied.	1
I	1
have	1
always	1
wanted	1
some	1
other	1
motive	1
for	1
his	1
conduct	1
than	1
appeared.	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
know	1
his	1
present	1
opinion,	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
probability	1
of	1
the	1
event	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
in	1
dread	1
of;	1
whether	1
he	1
considers	1
the	1
danger	1
to	1
be	1
lessening	1
or	1
not."	1
"Lessening,	1
I	1
understand,"	1
replied	1
Mrs	1
Smith.	1
"He	1
thinks	1
Mrs	1
Clay	1
afraid	1
of	1
him,	1
aware	1
that	1
he	1
sees	1
through	1
her,	1
and	1
not	1
daring	1
to	1
proceed	1
as	1
she	1
might	1
do	1
in	1
his	1
absence.	1
But	1
since	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
absent	1
some	1
time	1
or	1
other,	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
perceive	1
how	1
he	1
can	1
ever	1
be	1
secure	1
while	1
she	1
holds	1
her	1
present	1
influence.	1
Mrs	1
Wallis	1
has	1
an	1
amusing	1
idea,	1
as	1
nurse	1
tells	1
me,	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
put	1
into	1
the	1
marriage	1
articles	1
when	1
you	1
and	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
marry,	1
that	1
your	1
father	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
marry	1
Mrs	1
Clay.	1
A	1
scheme,	1
worthy	1
of	1
Mrs	1
Wallis's	1
understanding,	1
by	1
all	1
accounts;	1
but	1
my	1
sensible	1
nurse	1
Rooke	1
sees	1
the	1
absurdity	1
of	1
it.	1
`Why,	1
to	1
be	1
sure,	1
ma'am,'	1
said	1
she,	1
`it	1
would	1
not	1
prevent	1
his	1
marrying	1
anybody	1
else.'	1
And,	1
indeed,	1
to	1
own	1
the	1
truth,	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
nurse,	1
in	1
her	1
heart,	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
strenuous	1
opposer	1
of	1
Sir	1
Walter's	1
making	1
a	1
second	1
match.	1
She	1
must	1
be	1
allowed	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
favourer	1
of	1
matrimony,	1
you	1
know;	1
and	1
(since	1
self	1
will	1
intrude)	1
who	1
can	1
say	1
that	1
she	1
may	1
not	1
have	1
some	1
flying	1
visions	1
of	1
attending	1
the	1
next	1
Lady	1
Elliot,	1
through	1
Mrs	1
Wallis's	1
recommendation?"	1
"I	1
am	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
know	1
all	1
this,"	1
said	1
Anne,	1
after	1
a	1
little	1
thoughtfulness.	1
"It	1
will	1
be	1
more	1
painful	1
to	1
me	1
in	1
some	1
respects	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
company	1
with	1
him,	1
but	1
I	1
shall	1
know	1
better	1
what	1
to	1
do.	1
My	1
line	1
of	1
conduct	1
will	1
be	1
more	1
direct.	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
is	1
evidently	1
a	1
disingenuous,	1
artificial,	1
worldly	1
man,	1
who	1
has	1
never	1
had	1
any	1
better	1
principle	1
to	1
guide	1
him	1
than	1
selfishness."	1
But	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
was	1
not	1
done	1
with.	1
Mrs	1
Smith	1
had	1
been	1
carried	1
away	1
from	1
her	1
first	1
direction,	1
and	1
Anne	1
had	1
forgotten,	1
in	1
the	1
interest	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
family	1
concerns,	1
how	1
much	1
had	1
been	1
originally	1
implied	1
against	1
him;	1
but	1
her	1
attention	1
was	1
now	1
called	1
to	1
the	1
explanation	1
of	1
those	1
first	1
hints,	1
and	1
she	1
listened	1
to	1
a	1
recital	1
which,	1
if	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
perfectly	1
justify	1
the	1
unqualified	1
bitterness	1
of	1
Mrs	1
Smith,	1
proved	1
him	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
very	1
unfeeling	1
in	1
his	1
conduct	1
towards	1
her;	1
very	1
deficient	1
both	1
in	1
justice	1
and	1
compassion.	1
She	1
learned	1
that	1
(the	1
intimacy	1
between	1
them	1
continuing	1
unimpaired	1
by	1
Mr	1
Elliot's	1
marriage)	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
as	1
before	1
always	1
together,	1
and	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
had	1
led	1
his	1
friend	1
into	1
expenses	1
much	1
beyond	1
his	1
fortune.	1
Mrs	1
Smith	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
take	1
blame	1
to	1
herself,	1
and	1
was	1
most	1
tender	1
of	1
throwing	1
any	1
on	1
her	1
husband;	1
but	1
Anne	1
could	1
collect	1
that	1
their	1
income	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
equal	1
to	1
their	1
style	1
of	1
living,	1
and	1
that	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
general	1
and	1
joint	1
extravagance.	1
From	1
his	1
wife's	1
account	1
of	1
him	1
she	1
could	1
discern	1
Mr	1
Smith	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
warm	1
feelings,	1
easy	1
temper,	1
careless	1
habits,	1
and	1
not	1
strong	1
understanding,	1
much	1
more	1
amiable	1
than	1
his	1
friend,	1
and	1
very	1
unlike	1
him,	1
led	1
by	1
him,	1
and	1
probably	1
despised	1
by	1
him.	1
Mr	1
Elliot,	1
raised	1
by	1
his	1
marriage	1
to	1
great	1
affluence,	1
and	1
disposed	1
to	1
every	1
gratification	1
of	1
pleasure	1
and	1
vanity	1
which	1
could	1
be	1
commanded	1
without	1
involving	1
himself,	1
(for	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
self-indulgence	1
he	1
had	1
become	1
a	1
prudent	1
man),	1
and	1
beginning	1
to	1
be	1
rich,	1
just	1
as	1
his	1
friend	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
found	1
himself	1
to	1
be	1
poor,	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
had	1
no	1
concern	1
at	1
all	1
for	1
that	1
friend's	1
probable	1
finances,	1
but,	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
had	1
been	1
prompting	1
and	1
encouraging	1
expenses	1
which	1
could	1
end	1
only	1
in	1
ruin;	1
and	1
the	1
Smiths	1
accordingly	1
had	1
been	1
ruined.	1
The	1
husband	1
had	1
died	1
just	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
be	1
spared	1
the	1
full	1
knowledge	1
of	1
it.	1
They	1
had	1
previously	1
known	1
embarrassments	1
enough	1
to	1
try	1
the	1
friendship	1
of	1
their	1
friends,	1
and	1
to	1
prove	1
that	1
Mr	1
Elliot's	1
had	1
better	1
not	1
be	1
tried;	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
till	1
his	1
death	1
that	1
the	1
wretched	1
state	1
of	1
his	1
affairs	1
was	1
fully	1
known.	1
With	1
a	1
confidence	1
in	1
Mr	1
Elliot's	1
regard,	1
more	1
creditable	1
to	1
his	1
feelings	1
than	1
his	1
judgement,	1
Mr	1
Smith	1
had	1
appointed	1
him	1
the	1
executor	1
of	1
his	1
will;	1
but	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
would	1
not	1
act,	1
and	1
the	1
difficulties	1
and	1
distress	1
which	1
this	1
refusal	1
had	1
heaped	1
on	1
her,	1
in	1
addition	1
to	1
the	1
inevitable	1
sufferings	1
of	1
her	1
situation,	1
had	1
been	1
such	1
as	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
related	1
without	1
anguish	1
of	1
spirit,	1
or	1
listened	1
to	1
without	1
corresponding	1
indignation.	1
Anne	1
was	1
shewn	1
some	1
letters	1
of	1
his	1
on	1
the	1
occasion,	1
answers	1
to	1
urgent	1
applications	1
from	1
Mrs	1
Smith,	1
which	1
all	1
breathed	1
the	1
same	1
stern	1
resolution	1
of	1
not	1
engaging	1
in	1
a	1
fruitless	1
trouble,	1
and,	1
under	1
a	1
cold	1
civility,	1
the	1
same	1
hard-hearted	1
indifference	1
to	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
evils	1
it	1
might	1
bring	1
on	1
her.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
dreadful	1
picture	1
of	1
ingratitude	1
and	1
inhumanity;	1
and	1
Anne	1
felt,	1
at	1
some	1
moments,	1
that	1
no	1
flagrant	1
open	1
crime	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
worse.	1
She	1
had	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
to	1
listen	1
to;	1
all	1
the	1
particulars	1
of	1
past	1
sad	1
scenes,	1
all	1
the	1
minutiae	1
of	1
distress	1
upon	1
distress,	1
which	1
in	1
former	1
conversations	1
had	1
been	1
merely	1
hinted	1
at,	1
were	1
dwelt	1
on	1
now	1
with	1
a	1
natural	1
indulgence.	1
Anne	1
could	1
perfectly	1
comprehend	1
the	1
exquisite	1
relief,	1
and	1
was	1
only	1
the	1
more	1
inclined	1
to	1
wonder	1
at	1
the	1
composure	1
of	1
her	1
friend's	1
usual	1
state	1
of	1
mind.	1
There	1
was	1
one	1
circumstance	1
in	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
her	1
grievances	1
of	1
particular	1
irritation.	1
She	1
had	1
good	1
reason	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
some	1
property	1
of	1
her	1
husband	1
in	1
the	1
West	1
Indies,	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
for	1
many	1
years	1
under	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
sequestration	1
for	1
the	1
payment	1
of	1
its	1
own	1
incumbrances,	1
might	1
be	1
recoverable	1
by	1
proper	1
measures;	1
and	1
this	1
property,	1
though	1
not	1
large,	1
would	1
be	1
enough	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
comparatively	1
rich.	1
But	1
there	1
was	1
nobody	1
to	1
stir	1
in	1
it.	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
would	1
do	1
nothing,	1
and	1
she	1
could	1
do	1
nothing	1
herself,	1
equally	1
disabled	1
from	1
personal	1
exertion	1
by	1
her	1
state	1
of	1
bodily	1
weakness,	1
and	1
from	1
employing	1
others	1
by	1
her	1
want	1
of	1
money.	1
She	1
had	1
no	1
natural	1
connexions	1
to	1
assist	1
her	1
even	1
with	1
their	1
counsel,	1
and	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
afford	1
to	1
purchase	1
the	1
assistance	1
of	1
the	1
law.	1
This	1
was	1
a	1
cruel	1
aggravation	1
of	1
actually	1
straitened	1
means.	1
To	1
feel	1
that	1
she	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
better	1
circumstances,	1
that	1
a	1
little	1
trouble	1
in	1
the	1
right	1
place	1
might	1
do	1
it,	1
and	1
to	1
fear	1
that	1
delay	1
might	1
be	1
even	1
weakening	1
her	1
claims,	1
was	1
hard	1
to	1
bear.	1
It	1
was	1
on	1
this	1
point	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
hoped	1
to	1
engage	1
Anne's	1
good	1
offices	1
with	1
Mr	1
Elliot.	1
She	1
had	1
previously,	1
in	1
the	1
anticipation	1
of	1
their	1
marriage,	1
been	1
very	1
apprehensive	1
of	1
losing	1
her	1
friend	1
by	1
it;	1
but	1
on	1
being	1
assured	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
have	1
made	1
no	1
attempt	1
of	1
that	1
nature,	1
since	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
know	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
Bath,	1
it	1
immediately	1
occurred,	1
that	1
something	1
might	1
be	1
done	1
in	1
her	1
favour	1
by	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
the	1
woman	1
he	1
loved,	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
hastily	1
preparing	1
to	1
interest	1
Anne's	1
feelings,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
the	1
observances	1
due	1
to	1
Mr	1
Elliot's	1
character	1
would	1
allow,	1
when	1
Anne's	1
refutation	1
of	1
the	1
supposed	1
engagement	1
changed	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
everything;	1
and	1
while	1
it	1
took	1
from	1
her	1
the	1
new-formed	1
hope	1
of	1
succeeding	1
in	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
her	1
first	1
anxiety,	1
left	1
her	1
at	1
least	1
the	1
comfort	1
of	1
telling	1
the	1
whole	1
story	1
her	1
own	1
way.	1
After	1
listening	1
to	1
this	1
full	1
description	1
of	1
Mr	1
Elliot,	1
Anne	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
express	1
some	1
surprise	1
at	1
Mrs	1
Smith's	1
having	1
spoken	1
of	1
him	1
so	1
favourably	1
in	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
their	1
conversation.	1
"She	1
had	1
seemed	1
to	1
recommend	1
and	1
praise	1
him!"	1
"My	1
dear,"	1
was	1
Mrs	1
Smith's	1
reply,	1
"there	1
was	1
nothing	1
else	1
to	1
be	1
done.	1
I	1
considered	1
your	1
marrying	1
him	1
as	1
certain,	1
though	1
he	1
might	1
not	1
yet	1
have	1
made	1
the	1
offer,	1
and	1
I	1
could	1
no	1
more	1
speak	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
him,	1
than	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
your	1
husband.	1
My	1
heart	1
bled	1
for	1
you,	1
as	1
I	1
talked	1
of	1
happiness;	1
and	1
yet	1
he	1
is	1
sensible,	1
he	1
is	1
agreeable,	1
and	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
woman	1
as	1
you,	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
absolutely	1
hopeless.	1
He	1
was	1
very	1
unkind	1
to	1
his	1
first	1
wife.	1
They	1
were	1
wretched	1
together.	1
But	1
she	1
was	1
too	1
ignorant	1
and	1
giddy	1
for	1
respect,	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
loved	1
her.	1
I	1
was	1
willing	1
to	1
hope	1
that	1
you	1
must	1
fare	1
better."	1
Anne	1
could	1
just	1
acknowledge	1
within	1
herself	1
such	1
a	1
possibility	1
of	1
having	1
been	1
induced	1
to	1
marry	1
him,	1
as	1
made	1
her	1
shudder	1
at	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
the	1
misery	1
which	1
must	1
have	1
followed.	1
It	1
was	1
just	1
possible	1
that	1
she	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
persuaded	1
by	1
Lady	1
Russell!	1
And	1
under	1
such	1
a	1
supposition,	1
which	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
most	1
miserable,	1
when	1
time	1
had	1
disclosed	1
all,	1
too	1
late?	1
It	1
was	1
very	1
desirable	1
that	1
Lady	1
Russell	1
should	1
be	1
no	1
longer	1
deceived;	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
concluding	1
arrangements	1
of	1
this	1
important	1
conference,	1
which	1
carried	1
them	1
through	1
the	1
greater	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
morning,	1
was,	1
that	1
Anne	1
had	1
full	1
liberty	1
to	1
communicate	1
to	1
her	1
friend	1
everything	1
relative	1
to	1
Mrs	1
Smith,	1
in	1
which	1
his	1
conduct	1
was	1
involved.	1
Chapter	1
22	1
Anne	1
went	1
home	1
to	1
think	1
over	1
all	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
heard.	1
In	1
one	1
point,	1
her	1
feelings	1
were	1
relieved	1
by	1
this	1
knowledge	1
of	1
Mr	1
Elliot.	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
anything	1
of	1
tenderness	1
due	1
to	1
him.	1
He	1
stood	1
as	1
opposed	1
to	1
Captain	1
Wentworth,	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
own	1
unwelcome	1
obtrusiveness;	1
and	1
the	1
evil	1
of	1
his	1
attentions	1
last	1
night,	1
the	1
irremediable	1
mischief	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
done,	1
was	1
considered	1
with	1
sensations	1
unqualified,	1
unperplexed.	1
Pity	1
for	1
him	1
was	1
all	1
over.	1
But	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
point	1
of	1
relief.	1
In	1
every	1
other	1
respect,	1
in	1
looking	1
around	1
her,	1
or	1
penetrating	1
forward,	1
she	1
saw	1
more	1
to	1
distrust	1
and	1
to	1
apprehend.	1
She	1
was	1
concerned	1
for	1
the	1
disappointment	1
and	1
pain	1
Lady	1
Russell	1
would	1
be	1
feeling;	1
for	1
the	1
mortifications	1
which	1
must	1
be	1
hanging	1
over	1
her	1
father	1
and	1
sister,	1
and	1
had	1
all	1
the	1
distress	1
of	1
foreseeing	1
many	1
evils,	1
without	1
knowing	1
how	1
to	1
avert	1
any	1
one	1
of	1
them.	1
She	1
was	1
most	1
thankful	1
for	1
her	1
own	1
knowledge	1
of	1
him.	1
She	1
had	1
never	1
considered	1
herself	1
as	1
entitled	1
to	1
reward	1
for	1
not	1
slighting	1
an	1
old	1
friend	1
like	1
Mrs	1
Smith,	1
but	1
here	1
was	1
a	1
reward	1
indeed	1
springing	1
from	1
it!	1
Mrs	1
Smith	1
had	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
tell	1
her	1
what	1
no	1
one	1
else	1
could	1
have	1
done.	1
Could	1
the	1
knowledge	1
have	1
been	1
extended	1
through	1
her	1
family?	1
But	1
this	1
was	1
a	1
vain	1
idea.	1
She	1
must	1
talk	1
to	1
Lady	1
Russell,	1
tell	1
her,	1
consult	1
with	1
her,	1
and	1
having	1
done	1
her	1
best,	1
wait	1
the	1
event	1
with	1
as	1
much	1
composure	1
as	1
possible;	1
and	1
after	1
all,	1
her	1
greatest	1
want	1
of	1
composure	1
would	1
be	1
in	1
that	1
quarter	1
of	1
the	1
mind	1
which	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
opened	1
to	1
Lady	1
Russell;	1
in	1
that	1
flow	1
of	1
anxieties	1
and	1
fears	1
which	1
must	1
be	1
all	1
to	1
herself.	1
She	1
found,	1
on	1
reaching	1
home,	1
that	1
she	1
had,	1
as	1
she	1
intended,	1
escaped	1
seeing	1
Mr	1
Elliot;	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
called	1
and	1
paid	1
them	1
a	1
long	1
morning	1
visit;	1
but	1
hardly	1
had	1
she	1
congratulated	1
herself,	1
and	1
felt	1
safe,	1
when	1
she	1
heard	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
coming	1
again	1
in	1
the	1
evening.	1
"I	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
smallest	1
intention	1
of	1
asking	1
him,"	1
said	1
Elizabeth,	1
with	1
affected	1
carelessness,	1
"but	1
he	1
gave	1
so	1
many	1
hints;	1
so	1
Mrs	1
Clay	1
says,	1
at	1
least."	1
"Indeed,	1
I	1
do	1
say	1
it.	1
I	1
never	1
saw	1
anybody	1
in	1
my	1
life	1
spell	1
harder	1
for	1
an	1
invitation.	1
Poor	1
man!	1
I	1
was	1
really	1
in	1
pain	1
for	1
him;	1
for	1
your	1
hard-hearted	1
sister,	1
Miss	1
Anne,	1
seems	1
bent	1
on	1
cruelty."	1
"Oh!"	1
cried	1
Elizabeth,	1
"I	1
have	1
been	1
rather	1
too	1
much	1
used	1
to	1
the	1
game	1
to	1
be	1
soon	1
overcome	1
by	1
a	1
gentleman's	1
hints.	1
However,	1
when	1
I	1
found	1
how	1
excessively	1
he	1
was	1
regretting	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
miss	1
my	1
father	1
this	1
morning,	1
I	1
gave	1
way	1
immediately,	1
for	1
I	1
would	1
never	1
really	1
omit	1
an	1
opportunity	1
of	1
bring	1
him	1
and	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
together.	1
They	1
appear	1
to	1
so	1
much	1
advantage	1
in	1
company	1
with	1
each	1
other.	1
Each	1
behaving	1
so	1
pleasantly.	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
looking	1
up	1
with	1
so	1
much	1
respect."	1
"Quite	1
delightful!"	1
cried	1
Mrs	1
Clay,	1
not	1
daring,	1
however,	1
to	1
turn	1
her	1
eyes	1
towards	1
Anne.	1
"Exactly	1
like	1
father	1
and	1
son!	1
Dear	1
Miss	1
Elliot,	1
may	1
I	1
not	1
say	1
father	1
and	1
son?"	1
"Oh!	1
I	1
lay	1
no	1
embargo	1
on	1
any	1
body's	1
words.	1
If	1
you	1
will	1
have	1
such	1
ideas!	1
But,	1
upon	1
my	1
word,	1
I	1
am	1
scarcely	1
sensible	1
of	1
his	1
attentions	1
being	1
beyond	1
those	1
of	1
other	1
men."	1
"My	1
dear	1
Miss	1
Elliot!"	1
exclaimed	1
Mrs	1
Clay,	1
lifting	1
her	1
hands	1
and	1
eyes,	1
and	1
sinking	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
her	1
astonishment	1
in	1
a	1
convenient	1
silence.	1
"Well,	1
my	1
dear	1
Penelope,	1
you	1
need	1
not	1
be	1
so	1
alarmed	1
about	1
him.	1
I	1
did	1
invite	1
him,	1
you	1
know.	1
I	1
sent	1
him	1
away	1
with	1
smiles.	1
When	1
I	1
found	1
he	1
was	1
really	1
going	1
to	1
his	1
friends	1
at	1
Thornberry	1
Park	1
for	1
the	1
whole	1
day	1
to-morrow,	1
I	1
had	1
compassion	1
on	1
him."	1
Anne	1
admired	1
the	1
good	1
acting	1
of	1
the	1
friend,	1
in	1
being	1
able	1
to	1
shew	1
such	1
pleasure	1
as	1
she	1
did,	1
in	1
the	1
expectation	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
actual	1
arrival	1
of	1
the	1
very	1
person	1
whose	1
presence	1
must	1
really	1
be	1
interfering	1
with	1
her	1
prime	1
object.	1
It	1
was	1
impossible	1
but	1
that	1
Mrs	1
Clay	1
must	1
hate	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
Mr	1
Elliot;	1
and	1
yet	1
she	1
could	1
assume	1
a	1
most	1
obliging,	1
placid	1
look,	1
and	1
appear	1
quite	1
satisfied	1
with	1
the	1
curtailed	1
license	1
of	1
devoting	1
herself	1
only	1
half	1
as	1
much	1
to	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
as	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
done	1
otherwise.	1
To	1
Anne	1
herself	1
it	1
was	1
most	1
distressing	1
to	1
see	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
enter	1
the	1
room;	1
and	1
quite	1
painful	1
to	1
have	1
him	1
approach	1
and	1
speak	1
to	1
her.	1
She	1
had	1
been	1
used	1
before	1
to	1
feel	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
always	1
quite	1
sincere,	1
but	1
now	1
she	1
saw	1
insincerity	1
in	1
everything.	1
His	1
attentive	1
deference	1
to	1
her	1
father,	1
contrasted	1
with	1
his	1
former	1
language,	1
was	1
odious;	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
thought	1
of	1
his	1
cruel	1
conduct	1
towards	1
Mrs	1
Smith,	1
she	1
could	1
hardly	1
bear	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
his	1
present	1
smiles	1
and	1
mildness,	1
or	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
his	1
artificial	1
good	1
sentiments.	1
She	1
meant	1
to	1
avoid	1
any	1
such	1
alteration	1
of	1
manners	1
as	1
might	1
provoke	1
a	1
remonstrance	1
on	1
his	1
side.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
object	1
to	1
her	1
to	1
escape	1
all	1
enquiry	1
or	1
eclat;	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
her	1
intention	1
to	1
be	1
as	1
decidedly	1
cool	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
might	1
be	1
compatible	1
with	1
their	1
relationship;	1
and	1
to	1
retrace,	1
as	1
quietly	1
as	1
she	1
could,	1
the	1
few	1
steps	1
of	1
unnecessary	1
intimacy	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
gradually	1
led	1
along.	1
She	1
was	1
accordingly	1
more	1
guarded,	1
and	1
more	1
cool,	1
than	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
night	1
before.	1
He	1
wanted	1
to	1
animate	1
her	1
curiosity	1
again	1
as	1
to	1
how	1
and	1
where	1
he	1
could	1
have	1
heard	1
her	1
formerly	1
praised;	1
wanted	1
very	1
much	1
to	1
be	1
gratified	1
by	1
more	1
solicitation;	1
but	1
the	1
charm	1
was	1
broken:	1
he	1
found	1
that	1
the	1
heat	1
and	1
animation	1
of	1
a	1
public	1
room	1
was	1
necessary	1
to	1
kindle	1
his	1
modest	1
cousin's	1
vanity;	1
he	1
found,	1
at	1
least,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
now,	1
by	1
any	1
of	1
those	1
attempts	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
hazard	1
among	1
the	1
too-commanding	1
claims	1
of	1
the	1
others.	1
He	1
little	1
surmised	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
subject	1
acting	1
now	1
exactly	1
against	1
his	1
interest,	1
bringing	1
immediately	1
to	1
her	1
thoughts	1
all	1
those	1
parts	1
of	1
his	1
conduct	1
which	1
were	1
least	1
excusable.	1
She	1
had	1
some	1
satisfaction	1
in	1
finding	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
really	1
going	1
out	1
of	1
Bath	1
the	1
next	1
morning,	1
going	1
early,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
gone	1
the	1
greater	1
part	1
of	1
two	1
days.	1
He	1
was	1
invited	1
again	1
to	1
Camden	1
Place	1
the	1
very	1
evening	1
of	1
his	1
return;	1
but	1
from	1
Thursday	1
to	1
Saturday	1
evening	1
his	1
absence	1
was	1
certain.	1
It	1
was	1
bad	1
enough	1
that	1
a	1
Mrs	1
Clay	1
should	1
be	1
always	1
before	1
her;	1
but	1
that	1
a	1
deeper	1
hypocrite	1
should	1
be	1
added	1
to	1
their	1
party,	1
seemed	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
everything	1
like	1
peace	1
and	1
comfort.	1
It	1
was	1
so	1
humiliating	1
to	1
reflect	1
on	1
the	1
constant	1
deception	1
practised	1
on	1
her	1
father	1
and	1
Elizabeth;	1
to	1
consider	1
the	1
various	1
sources	1
of	1
mortification	1
preparing	1
for	1
them!	1
Mrs	1
Clay's	1
selfishness	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
complicate	1
nor	1
so	1
revolting	1
as	1
his;	1
and	1
Anne	1
would	1
have	1
compounded	1
for	1
the	1
marriage	1
at	1
once,	1
with	1
all	1
its	1
evils,	1
to	1
be	1
clear	1
of	1
Mr	1
Elliot's	1
subtleties	1
in	1
endeavouring	1
to	1
prevent	1
it.	1
On	1
Friday	1
morning	1
she	1
meant	1
to	1
go	1
very	1
early	1
to	1
Lady	1
Russell,	1
and	1
accomplish	1
the	1
necessary	1
communication;	1
and	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
gone	1
directly	1
after	1
breakfast,	1
but	1
that	1
Mrs	1
Clay	1
was	1
also	1
going	1
out	1
on	1
some	1
obliging	1
purpose	1
of	1
saving	1
her	1
sister	1
trouble,	1
which	1
determined	1
her	1
to	1
wait	1
till	1
she	1
might	1
be	1
safe	1
from	1
such	1
a	1
companion.	1
She	1
saw	1
Mrs	1
Clay	1
fairly	1
off,	1
therefore,	1
before	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
talk	1
of	1
spending	1
the	1
morning	1
in	1
Rivers	1
Street.	1
"Very	1
well,"	1
said	1
Elizabeth,	1
"I	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
send	1
but	1
my	1
love.	1
Oh!	1
you	1
may	1
as	1
well	1
take	1
back	1
that	1
tiresome	1
book	1
she	1
would	1
lend	1
me,	1
and	1
pretend	1
I	1
have	1
read	1
it	1
through.	1
I	1
really	1
cannot	1
be	1
plaguing	1
myself	1
for	1
ever	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
new	1
poems	1
and	1
states	1
of	1
the	1
nation	1
that	1
come	1
out.	1
Lady	1
Russell	1
quite	1
bores	1
one	1
with	1
her	1
new	1
publications.	1
You	1
need	1
not	1
tell	1
her	1
so,	1
but	1
I	1
thought	1
her	1
dress	1
hideous	1
the	1
other	1
night.	1
I	1
used	1
to	1
think	1
she	1
had	1
some	1
taste	1
in	1
dress,	1
but	1
I	1
was	1
ashamed	1
of	1
her	1
at	1
the	1
concert.	1
Something	1
so	1
formal	1
and	1
arrange	1
in	1
her	1
air!	1
and	1
she	1
sits	1
so	1
upright!	1
My	1
best	1
love,	1
of	1
course."	1
"And	1
mine,"	1
added	1
Sir	1
Walter.	1
"Kindest	1
regards.	1
And	1
you	1
may	1
say,	1
that	1
I	1
mean	1
to	1
call	1
upon	1
her	1
soon.	1
Make	1
a	1
civil	1
message;	1
but	1
I	1
shall	1
only	1
leave	1
my	1
card.	1
Morning	1
visits	1
are	1
never	1
fair	1
by	1
women	1
at	1
her	1
time	1
of	1
life,	1
who	1
make	1
themselves	1
up	1
so	1
little.	1
If	1
she	1
would	1
only	1
wear	1
rouge	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
afraid	1
of	1
being	1
seen;	1
but	1
last	1
time	1
I	1
called,	1
I	1
observed	1
the	1
blinds	1
were	1
let	1
down	1
immediately."	1
While	1
her	1
father	1
spoke,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
knock	1
at	1
the	1
door.	1
Who	1
could	1
it	1
be?	1
Anne,	1
remembering	1
the	1
preconcerted	1
visits,	1
at	1
all	1
hours,	1
of	1
Mr	1
Elliot,	1
would	1
have	1
expected	1
him,	1
but	1
for	1
his	1
known	1
engagement	1
seven	1
miles	1
off.	1
After	1
the	1
usual	1
period	1
of	1
suspense,	1
the	1
usual	1
sounds	1
of	1
approach	1
were	1
heard,	1
and	1
"Mr	1
and	1
Mrs	1
Charles	1
Musgrove"	1
were	1
ushered	1
into	1
the	1
room.	1
Surprise	1
was	1
the	1
strongest	1
emotion	1
raised	1
by	1
their	1
appearance;	1
but	1
Anne	1
was	1
really	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
them;	1
and	1
the	1
others	1
were	1
not	1
so	1
sorry	1
but	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
put	1
on	1
a	1
decent	1
air	1
of	1
welcome;	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
it	1
became	1
clear	1
that	1
these,	1
their	1
nearest	1
relations,	1
were	1
not	1
arrived	1
with	1
an	1
views	1
of	1
accommodation	1
in	1
that	1
house,	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
were	1
able	1
to	1
rise	1
in	1
cordiality,	1
and	1
do	1
the	1
honours	1
of	1
it	1
very	1
well.	1
They	1
were	1
come	1
to	1
Bath	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
with	1
Mrs	1
Musgrove,	1
and	1
were	1
at	1
the	1
White	1
Hart.	1
So	1
much	1
was	1
pretty	1
soon	1
understood;	1
but	1
till	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
were	1
walking	1
Mary	1
into	1
the	1
other	1
drawing-room,	1
and	1
regaling	1
themselves	1
with	1
her	1
admiration,	1
Anne	1
could	1
not	1
draw	1
upon	1
Charles's	1
brain	1
for	1
a	1
regular	1
history	1
of	1
their	1
coming,	1
or	1
an	1
explanation	1
of	1
some	1
smiling	1
hints	1
of	1
particular	1
business,	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
ostentatiously	1
dropped	1
by	1
Mary,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
of	1
some	1
apparent	1
confusion	1
as	1
to	1
whom	1
their	1
party	1
consisted	1
of.	1
She	1
then	1
found	1
that	1
it	1
consisted	1
of	1
Mrs	1
Musgrove,	1
Henrietta,	1
and	1
Captain	1
Harville,	1
beside	1
their	1
two	1
selves.	1
He	1
gave	1
her	1
a	1
very	1
plain,	1
intelligible	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
whole;	1
a	1
narration	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
saw	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
most	1
characteristic	1
proceeding.	1
The	1
scheme	1
had	1
received	1
its	1
first	1
impulse	1
by	1
Captain	1
Harville's	1
wanting	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
Bath	1
on	1
business.	1
He	1
had	1
begun	1
to	1
talk	1
of	1
it	1
a	1
week	1
ago;	1
and	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
doing	1
something,	1
as	1
shooting	1
was	1
over,	1
Charles	1
had	1
proposed	1
coming	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
Mrs	1
Harville	1
had	1
seemed	1
to	1
like	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
it	1
very	1
much,	1
as	1
an	1
advantage	1
to	1
her	1
husband;	1
but	1
Mary	1
could	1
not	1
bear	1
to	1
be	1
left,	1
and	1
had	1
made	1
herself	1
so	1
unhappy	1
about	1
it,	1
that	1
for	1
a	1
day	1
or	1
two	1
everything	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
suspense,	1
or	1
at	1
an	1
end.	1
But	1
then,	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
taken	1
up	1
by	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
mother.	1
His	1
mother	1
had	1
some	1
old	1
friends	1
in	1
Bath	1
whom	1
she	1
wanted	1
to	1
see;	1
it	1
was	1
thought	1
a	1
good	1
opportunity	1
for	1
Henrietta	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
buy	1
wedding-clothes	1
for	1
herself	1
and	1
her	1
sister;	1
and,	1
in	1
short,	1
it	1
ended	1
in	1
being	1
his	1
mother's	1
party,	1
that	1
everything	1
might	1
be	1
comfortable	1
and	1
easy	1
to	1
Captain	1
Harville;	1
and	1
he	1
and	1
Mary	1
were	1
included	1
in	1
it	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
general	1
convenience.	1
They	1
had	1
arrived	1
late	1
the	1
night	1
before.	1
Mrs	1
Harville,	1
her	1
children,	1
and	1
Captain	1
Benwick,	1
remained	1
with	1
Mr	1
Musgrove	1
and	1
Louisa	1
at	1
Uppercross.	1
Anne's	1
only	1
surprise	1
was,	1
that	1
affairs	1
should	1
be	1
in	1
forwardness	1
enough	1
for	1
Henrietta's	1
wedding-clothes	1
to	1
be	1
talked	1
of.	1
She	1
had	1
imagined	1
such	1
difficulties	1
of	1
fortune	1
to	1
exist	1
there	1
as	1
must	1
prevent	1
the	1
marriage	1
from	1
being	1
near	1
at	1
hand;	1
but	1
she	1
learned	1
from	1
Charles	1
that,	1
very	1
recently,	1
(since	1
Mary's	1
last	1
letter	1
to	1
herself),	1
Charles	1
Hayter	1
had	1
been	1
applied	1
to	1
by	1
a	1
friend	1
to	1
hold	1
a	1
living	1
for	1
a	1
youth	1
who	1
could	1
not	1
possibly	1
claim	1
it	1
under	1
many	1
years;	1
and	1
that	1
on	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
his	1
present	1
income,	1
with	1
almost	1
a	1
certainty	1
of	1
something	1
more	1
permanent	1
long	1
before	1
the	1
term	1
in	1
question,	1
the	1
two	1
families	1
had	1
consented	1
to	1
the	1
young	1
people's	1
wishes,	1
and	1
that	1
their	1
marriage	1
was	1
likely	1
to	1
take	1
place	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
months,	1
quite	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
Louisa's.	1
"And	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
living	1
it	1
was,"	1
Charles	1
added:	1
"only	1
five-and-twenty	1
miles	1
from	1
Uppercross,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
fine	1
country:	1
fine	1
part	1
of	1
Dorsetshire.	1
In	1
the	1
centre	1
of	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
preserves	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom,	1
surrounded	1
by	1
three	1
great	1
proprietors,	1
each	1
more	1
careful	1
and	1
jealous	1
than	1
the	1
other;	1
and	1
to	1
two	1
of	1
the	1
three	1
at	1
least,	1
Charles	1
Hayter	1
might	1
get	1
a	1
special	1
recommendation.	1
Not	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
value	1
it	1
as	1
he	1
ought,"	1
he	1
observed,	1
"Charles	1
is	1
too	1
cool	1
about	1
sporting.	1
That's	1
the	1
worst	1
of	1
him."	1
"I	1
am	1
extremely	1
glad,	1
indeed,"	1
cried	1
Anne,	1
"particularly	1
glad	1
that	1
this	1
should	1
happen;	1
and	1
that	1
of	1
two	1
sisters,	1
who	1
both	1
deserve	1
equally	1
well,	1
and	1
who	1
have	1
always	1
been	1
such	1
good	1
friends,	1
the	1
pleasant	1
prospect	1
of	1
one	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
dimming	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
other--	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
so	1
equal	1
in	1
their	1
prosperity	1
and	1
comfort.	1
I	1
hope	1
your	1
father	1
and	1
mother	1
are	1
quite	1
happy	1
with	1
regard	1
to	1
both."	1
"Oh!	1
yes.	1
My	1
father	1
would	1
be	1
well	1
pleased	1
if	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
were	1
richer,	1
but	1
he	1
has	1
no	1
other	1
fault	1
to	1
find.	1
Money,	1
you	1
know,	1
coming	1
down	1
with	1
money--two	1
daughters	1
at	1
once--it	1
cannot	1
be	1
a	1
very	1
agreeable	1
operation,	1
and	1
it	1
streightens	1
him	1
as	1
to	1
many	1
things.	1
However,	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
mean	1
to	1
say	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
a	1
right	1
to	1
it.	1
It	1
is	1
very	1
fit	1
they	1
should	1
have	1
daughters'	1
shares;	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
he	1
has	1
always	1
been	1
a	1
very	1
kind,	1
liberal	1
father	1
to	1
me.	1
Mary	1
does	1
not	1
above	1
half	1
like	1
Henrietta's	1
match.	1
She	1
never	1
did,	1
you	1
know.	1
But	1
she	1
does	1
not	1
do	1
him	1
justice,	1
nor	1
think	1
enough	1
about	1
Winthrop.	1
I	1
cannot	1
make	1
her	1
attend	1
to	1
the	1
value	1
of	1
the	1
property.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
fair	1
match,	1
as	1
times	1
go;	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
liked	1
Charles	1
Hayter	1
all	1
my	1
life,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
leave	1
off	1
now."	1
"Such	1
excellent	1
parents	1
as	1
Mr	1
and	1
Mrs	1
Musgrove,"	1
exclaimed	1
Anne,	1
"should	1
be	1
happy	1
in	1
their	1
children's	1
marriages.	1
They	1
do	1
everything	1
to	1
confer	1
happiness,	1
I	1
am	1
sure.	1
What	1
a	1
blessing	1
to	1
young	1
people	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
such	1
hands!	1
Your	1
father	1
and	1
mother	1
seem	1
so	1
totally	1
free	1
from	1
all	1
those	1
ambitious	1
feelings	1
which	1
have	1
led	1
to	1
so	1
much	1
misconduct	1
and	1
misery,	1
both	1
in	1
young	1
and	1
old.	1
I	1
hope	1
you	1
think	1
Louisa	1
perfectly	1
recovered	1
now?"	1
He	1
answered	1
rather	1
hesitatingly,	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
believe	1
I	1
do;	1
very	1
much	1
recovered;	1
but	1
she	1
is	1
altered;	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
running	1
or	1
jumping	1
about,	1
no	1
laughing	1
or	1
dancing;	1
it	1
is	1
quite	1
different.	1
If	1
one	1
happens	1
only	1
to	1
shut	1
the	1
door	1
a	1
little	1
hard,	1
she	1
starts	1
and	1
wriggles	1
like	1
a	1
young	1
dab-chick	1
in	1
the	1
water;	1
and	1
Benwick	1
sits	1
at	1
her	1
elbow,	1
reading	1
verses,	1
or	1
whispering	1
to	1
her,	1
all	1
day	1
long."	1
Anne	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
laughing.	1
"That	1
cannot	1
be	1
much	1
to	1
your	1
taste,	1
I	1
know,"	1
said	1
she;	1
"but	1
I	1
do	1
believe	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
excellent	1
young	1
man."	1
"To	1
be	1
sure	1
he	1
is.	1
Nobody	1
doubts	1
it;	1
and	1
I	1
hope	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
I	1
am	1
so	1
illiberal	1
as	1
to	1
want	1
every	1
man	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
same	1
objects	1
and	1
pleasures	1
as	1
myself.	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
great	1
value	1
for	1
Benwick;	1
and	1
when	1
one	1
can	1
but	1
get	1
him	1
to	1
talk,	1
he	1
has	1
plenty	1
to	1
say.	1
His	1
reading	1
has	1
done	1
him	1
no	1
harm,	1
for	1
he	1
has	1
fought	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
read.	1
He	1
is	1
a	1
brave	1
fellow.	1
I	1
got	1
more	1
acquainted	1
with	1
him	1
last	1
Monday	1
than	1
ever	1
I	1
did	1
before.	1
We	1
had	1
a	1
famous	1
set-to	1
at	1
rat-hunting	1
all	1
the	1
morning	1
in	1
my	1
father's	1
great	1
barns;	1
and	1
he	1
played	1
his	1
part	1
so	1
well	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
liked	1
him	1
the	1
better	1
ever	1
since."	1
Here	1
they	1
were	1
interrupted	1
by	1
the	1
absolute	1
necessity	1
of	1
Charles's	1
following	1
the	1
others	1
to	1
admire	1
mirrors	1
and	1
china;	1
but	1
Anne	1
had	1
heard	1
enough	1
to	1
understand	1
the	1
present	1
state	1
of	1
Uppercross,	1
and	1
rejoice	1
in	1
its	1
happiness;	1
and	1
though	1
she	1
sighed	1
as	1
she	1
rejoiced,	1
her	1
sigh	1
had	1
none	1
of	1
the	1
ill-will	1
of	1
envy	1
in	1
it.	1
She	1
would	1
certainly	1
have	1
risen	1
to	1
their	1
blessings	1
if	1
she	1
could,	1
but	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
lessen	1
theirs.	1
The	1
visit	1
passed	1
off	1
altogether	1
in	1
high	1
good	1
humour.	1
Mary	1
was	1
in	1
excellent	1
spirits,	1
enjoying	1
the	1
gaiety	1
and	1
the	1
change,	1
and	1
so	1
well	1
satisfied	1
with	1
the	1
journey	1
in	1
her	1
mother-in-law's	1
carriage	1
with	1
four	1
horses,	1
and	1
with	1
her	1
own	1
complete	1
independence	1
of	1
Camden	1
Place,	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
exactly	1
in	1
a	1
temper	1
to	1
admire	1
everything	1
as	1
she	1
ought,	1
and	1
enter	1
most	1
readily	1
into	1
all	1
the	1
superiorities	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
detailed	1
to	1
her.	1
She	1
had	1
no	1
demands	1
on	1
her	1
father	1
or	1
sister,	1
and	1
her	1
consequence	1
was	1
just	1
enough	1
increased	1
by	1
their	1
handsome	1
drawing-rooms.	1
Elizabeth	1
was,	1
for	1
a	1
short	1
time,	1
suffering	1
a	1
good	1
deal.	1
She	1
felt	1
that	1
Mrs	1
Musgrove	1
and	1
all	1
her	1
party	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
asked	1
to	1
dine	1
with	1
them;	1
but	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
bear	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
difference	1
of	1
style,	1
the	1
reduction	1
of	1
servants,	1
which	1
a	1
dinner	1
must	1
betray,	1
witnessed	1
by	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
always	1
so	1
inferior	1
to	1
the	1
Elliots	1
of	1
Kellynch.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
struggle	1
between	1
propriety	1
and	1
vanity;	1
but	1
vanity	1
got	1
the	1
better,	1
and	1
then	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
happy	1
again.	1
These	1
were	1
her	1
internal	1
persuasions:	1
"Old	1
fashioned	1
notions;	1
country	1
hospitality;	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
profess	1
to	1
give	1
dinners;	1
few	1
people	1
in	1
Bath	1
do;	1
Lady	1
Alicia	1
never	1
does;	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
ask	1
her	1
own	1
sister's	1
family,	1
though	1
they	1
were	1
here	1
a	1
month:	1
and	1
I	1
dare	1
say	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
very	1
inconvenient	1
to	1
Mrs	1
Musgrove;	1
put	1
her	1
quite	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
way.	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
she	1
would	1
rather	1
not	1
come;	1
she	1
cannot	1
feel	1
easy	1
with	1
us.	1
I	1
will	1
ask	1
them	1
all	1
for	1
an	1
evening;	1
that	1
will	1
be	1
much	1
better;	1
that	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
novelty	1
and	1
a	1
treat.	1
They	1
have	1
not	1
seen	1
two	1
such	1
drawing	1
rooms	1
before.	1
They	1
will	1
be	1
delighted	1
to	1
come	1
to-morrow	1
evening.	1
It	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
regular	1
party,	1
small,	1
but	1
most	1
elegant."	1
And	1
this	1
satisfied	1
Elizabeth:	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
invitation	1
was	1
given	1
to	1
the	1
two	1
present,	1
and	1
promised	1
for	1
the	1
absent,	1
Mary	1
was	1
as	1
completely	1
satisfied.	1
She	1
was	1
particularly	1
asked	1
to	1
meet	1
Mr	1
Elliot,	1
and	1
be	1
introduced	1
to	1
Lady	1
Dalrymple	1
and	1
Miss	1
Carteret,	1
who	1
were	1
fortunately	1
already	1
engaged	1
to	1
come;	1
and	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
received	1
a	1
more	1
gratifying	1
attention.	1
Miss	1
Elliot	1
was	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
calling	1
on	1
Mrs	1
Musgrove	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
the	1
morning;	1
and	1
Anne	1
walked	1
off	1
with	1
Charles	1
and	1
Mary,	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
see	1
her	1
and	1
Henrietta	1
directly.	1
Her	1
plan	1
of	1
sitting	1
with	1
Lady	1
Russell	1
must	1
give	1
way	1
for	1
the	1
present.	1
They	1
all	1
three	1
called	1
in	1
Rivers	1
Street	1
for	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
minutes;	1
but	1
Anne	1
convinced	1
herself	1
that	1
a	1
day's	1
delay	1
of	1
the	1
intended	1
communication	1
could	1
be	1
of	1
no	1
consequence,	1
and	1
hastened	1
forward	1
to	1
the	1
White	1
Hart,	1
to	1
see	1
again	1
the	1
friends	1
and	1
companions	1
of	1
the	1
last	1
autumn,	1
with	1
an	1
eagerness	1
of	1
good-will	1
which	1
many	1
associations	1
contributed	1
to	1
form.	1
They	1
found	1
Mrs	1
Musgrove	1
and	1
her	1
daughter	1
within,	1
and	1
by	1
themselves,	1
and	1
Anne	1
had	1
the	1
kindest	1
welcome	1
from	1
each.	1
Henrietta	1
was	1
exactly	1
in	1
that	1
state	1
of	1
recently-improved	1
views,	1
of	1
fresh-formed	1
happiness,	1
which	1
made	1
her	1
full	1
of	1
regard	1
and	1
interest	1
for	1
everybody	1
she	1
had	1
ever	1
liked	1
before	1
at	1
all;	1
and	1
Mrs	1
Musgrove's	1
real	1
affection	1
had	1
been	1
won	1
by	1
her	1
usefulness	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
distress.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
heartiness,	1
and	1
a	1
warmth,	1
and	1
a	1
sincerity	1
which	1
Anne	1
delighted	1
in	1
the	1
more,	1
from	1
the	1
sad	1
want	1
of	1
such	1
blessings	1
at	1
home.	1
She	1
was	1
entreated	1
to	1
give	1
them	1
as	1
much	1
of	1
her	1
time	1
as	1
possible,	1
invited	1
for	1
every	1
day	1
and	1
all	1
day	1
long,	1
or	1
rather	1
claimed	1
as	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
family;	1
and,	1
in	1
return,	1
she	1
naturally	1
fell	1
into	1
all	1
her	1
wonted	1
ways	1
of	1
attention	1
and	1
assistance,	1
and	1
on	1
Charles's	1
leaving	1
them	1
together,	1
was	1
listening	1
to	1
Mrs	1
Musgrove's	1
history	1
of	1
Louisa,	1
and	1
to	1
Henrietta's	1
of	1
herself,	1
giving	1
opinions	1
on	1
business,	1
and	1
recommendations	1
to	1
shops;	1
with	1
intervals	1
of	1
every	1
help	1
which	1
Mary	1
required,	1
from	1
altering	1
her	1
ribbon	1
to	1
settling	1
her	1
accounts;	1
from	1
finding	1
her	1
keys,	1
and	1
assorting	1
her	1
trinkets,	1
to	1
trying	1
to	1
convince	1
her	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
ill-used	1
by	1
anybody;	1
which	1
Mary,	1
well	1
amused	1
as	1
she	1
generally	1
was,	1
in	1
her	1
station	1
at	1
a	1
window	1
overlooking	1
the	1
entrance	1
to	1
the	1
Pump	1
Room,	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
have	1
her	1
moments	1
of	1
imagining.	1
A	1
morning	1
of	1
thorough	1
confusion	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
expected.	1
A	1
large	1
party	1
in	1
an	1
hotel	1
ensured	1
a	1
quick-changing,	1
unsettled	1
scene.	1
One	1
five	1
minutes	1
brought	1
a	1
note,	1
the	1
next	1
a	1
parcel;	1
and	1
Anne	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
there	1
half	1
an	1
hour,	1
when	1
their	1
dining-room,	1
spacious	1
as	1
it	1
was,	1
seemed	1
more	1
than	1
half	1
filled:	1
a	1
party	1
of	1
steady	1
old	1
friends	1
were	1
seated	1
around	1
Mrs	1
Musgrove,	1
and	1
Charles	1
came	1
back	1
with	1
Captains	1
Harville	1
and	1
Wentworth.	1
The	1
appearance	1
of	1
the	1
latter	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
surprise	1
of	1
the	1
moment.	1
It	1
was	1
impossible	1
for	1
her	1
to	1
have	1
forgotten	1
to	1
feel	1
that	1
this	1
arrival	1
of	1
their	1
common	1
friends	1
must	1
be	1
soon	1
bringing	1
them	1
together	1
again.	1
Their	1
last	1
meeting	1
had	1
been	1
most	1
important	1
in	1
opening	1
his	1
feelings;	1
she	1
had	1
derived	1
from	1
it	1
a	1
delightful	1
conviction;	1
but	1
she	1
feared	1
from	1
his	1
looks,	1
that	1
the	1
same	1
unfortunate	1
persuasion,	1
which	1
had	1
hastened	1
him	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
Concert	1
Room,	1
still	1
governed.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
want	1
to	1
be	1
near	1
enough	1
for	1
conversation.	1
She	1
tried	1
to	1
be	1
calm,	1
and	1
leave	1
things	1
to	1
take	1
their	1
course,	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
dwell	1
much	1
on	1
this	1
argument	1
of	1
rational	1
dependence:--	1
"Surely,	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
constant	1
attachment	1
on	1
each	1
side,	1
our	1
hearts	1
must	1
understand	1
each	1
other	1
ere	1
long.	1
We	1
are	1
not	1
boy	1
and	1
girl,	1
to	1
be	1
captiously	1
irritable,	1
misled	1
by	1
every	1
moment's	1
inadvertence,	1
and	1
wantonly	1
playing	1
with	1
our	1
own	1
happiness."	1
And	1
yet,	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
afterwards,	1
she	1
felt	1
as	1
if	1
their	1
being	1
in	1
company	1
with	1
each	1
other,	1
under	1
their	1
present	1
circumstances,	1
could	1
only	1
be	1
exposing	1
them	1
to	1
inadvertencies	1
and	1
misconstructions	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
mischievous	1
kind.	1
"Anne,"	1
cried	1
Mary,	1
still	1
at	1
her	1
window,	1
"there	1
is	1
Mrs	1
Clay,	1
I	1
am	1
sure,	1
standing	1
under	1
the	1
colonnade,	1
and	1
a	1
gentleman	1
with	1
her.	1
I	1
saw	1
them	1
turn	1
the	1
corner	1
from	1
Bath	1
Street	1
just	1
now.	1
They	1
seemed	1
deep	1
in	1
talk.	1
Who	1
is	1
it?	1
Come,	1
and	1
tell	1
me.	1
Good	1
heavens!	1
I	1
recollect.	1
It	1
is	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
himself."	1
"No,"	1
cried	1
Anne,	1
quickly,	1
"it	1
cannot	1
be	1
Mr	1
Elliot,	1
I	1
assure	1
you.	1
He	1
was	1
to	1
leave	1
Bath	1
at	1
nine	1
this	1
morning,	1
and	1
does	1
not	1
come	1
back	1
till	1
to-morrow."	1
As	1
she	1
spoke,	1
she	1
felt	1
that	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
was	1
looking	1
at	1
her,	1
the	1
consciousness	1
of	1
which	1
vexed	1
and	1
embarrassed	1
her,	1
and	1
made	1
her	1
regret	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
said	1
so	1
much,	1
simple	1
as	1
it	1
was.	1
Mary,	1
resenting	1
that	1
she	1
should	1
be	1
supposed	1
not	1
to	1
know	1
her	1
own	1
cousin,	1
began	1
talking	1
very	1
warmly	1
about	1
the	1
family	1
features,	1
and	1
protesting	1
still	1
more	1
positively	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
Mr	1
Elliot,	1
calling	1
again	1
upon	1
Anne	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
look	1
for	1
herself,	1
but	1
Anne	1
did	1
not	1
mean	1
to	1
stir,	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
be	1
cool	1
and	1
unconcerned.	1
Her	1
distress	1
returned,	1
however,	1
on	1
perceiving	1
smiles	1
and	1
intelligent	1
glances	1
pass	1
between	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
of	1
the	1
lady	1
visitors,	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
believed	1
themselves	1
quite	1
in	1
the	1
secret.	1
It	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
the	1
report	1
concerning	1
her	1
had	1
spread,	1
and	1
a	1
short	1
pause	1
succeeded,	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
ensure	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
now	1
spread	1
farther.	1
"Do	1
come,	1
Anne"	1
cried	1
Mary,	1
"come	1
and	1
look	1
yourself.	1
You	1
will	1
be	1
too	1
late	1
if	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
make	1
haste.	1
They	1
are	1
parting;	1
they	1
are	1
shaking	1
hands.	1
He	1
is	1
turning	1
away.	1
Not	1
know	1
Mr	1
Elliot,	1
indeed!	1
You	1
seem	1
to	1
have	1
forgot	1
all	1
about	1
Lyme."	1
To	1
pacify	1
Mary,	1
and	1
perhaps	1
screen	1
her	1
own	1
embarrassment,	1
Anne	1
did	1
move	1
quietly	1
to	1
the	1
window.	1
She	1
was	1
just	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
ascertain	1
that	1
it	1
really	1
was	1
Mr	1
Elliot,	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
never	1
believed,	1
before	1
he	1
disappeared	1
on	1
one	1
side,	1
as	1
Mrs	1
Clay	1
walked	1
quickly	1
off	1
on	1
the	1
other;	1
and	1
checking	1
the	1
surprise	1
which	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
feel	1
at	1
such	1
an	1
appearance	1
of	1
friendly	1
conference	1
between	1
two	1
persons	1
of	1
totally	1
opposite	1
interest,	1
she	1
calmly	1
said,	1
"Yes,	1
it	1
is	1
Mr	1
Elliot,	1
certainly.	1
He	1
has	1
changed	1
his	1
hour	1
of	1
going,	1
I	1
suppose,	1
that	1
is	1
all,	1
or	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
mistaken,	1
I	1
might	1
not	1
attend;"	1
and	1
walked	1
back	1
to	1
her	1
chair,	1
recomposed,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
comfortable	1
hope	1
of	1
having	1
acquitted	1
herself	1
well.	1
The	1
visitors	1
took	1
their	1
leave;	1
and	1
Charles,	1
having	1
civilly	1
seen	1
them	1
off,	1
and	1
then	1
made	1
a	1
face	1
at	1
them,	1
and	1
abused	1
them	1
for	1
coming,	1
began	1
with--	1
"Well,	1
mother,	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
something	1
for	1
you	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
like.	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
to	1
the	1
theatre,	1
and	1
secured	1
a	1
box	1
for	1
to-morrow	1
night.	1
A'n't	1
I	1
a	1
good	1
boy?	1
I	1
know	1
you	1
love	1
a	1
play;	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
room	1
for	1
us	1
all.	1
It	1
holds	1
nine.	1
I	1
have	1
engaged	1
Captain	1
Wentworth.	1
Anne	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
sorry	1
to	1
join	1
us,	1
I	1
am	1
sure.	1
We	1
all	1
like	1
a	1
play.	1
Have	1
not	1
I	1
done	1
well,	1
mother?"	1
Mrs	1
Musgrove	1
was	1
good	1
humouredly	1
beginning	1
to	1
express	1
her	1
perfect	1
readiness	1
for	1
the	1
play,	1
if	1
Henrietta	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
others	1
liked	1
it,	1
when	1
Mary	1
eagerly	1
interrupted	1
her	1
by	1
exclaiming--	1
"Good	1
heavens,	1
Charles!	1
how	1
can	1
you	1
think	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
thing?	1
Take	1
a	1
box	1
for	1
to-morrow	1
night!	1
Have	1
you	1
forgot	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
engaged	1
to	1
Camden	1
Place	1
to-morrow	1
night?	1
and	1
that	1
we	1
were	1
most	1
particularly	1
asked	1
to	1
meet	1
Lady	1
Dalrymple	1
and	1
her	1
daughter,	1
and	1
Mr	1
Elliot,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
principal	1
family	1
connexions,	1
on	1
purpose	1
to	1
be	1
introduced	1
to	1
them?	1
How	1
can	1
you	1
be	1
so	1
forgetful?"	1
"Phoo!	1
phoo!"	1
replied	1
Charles,	1
"what's	1
an	1
evening	1
party?	1
Never	1
worth	1
remembering.	1
Your	1
father	1
might	1
have	1
asked	1
us	1
to	1
dinner,	1
I	1
think,	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
wanted	1
to	1
see	1
us.	1
You	1
may	1
do	1
as	1
you	1
like,	1
but	1
I	1
shall	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
play."	1
"Oh!	1
Charles,	1
I	1
declare	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
too	1
abominable	1
if	1
you	1
do,	1
when	1
you	1
promised	1
to	1
go."	1
"No,	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
promise.	1
I	1
only	1
smirked	1
and	1
bowed,	1
and	1
said	1
the	1
word	1
`happy.'	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
promise."	1
"But	1
you	1
must	1
go,	1
Charles.	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
unpardonable	1
to	1
fail.	1
We	1
were	1
asked	1
on	1
purpose	1
to	1
be	1
introduced.	1
There	1
was	1
always	1
such	1
a	1
great	1
connexion	1
between	1
the	1
Dalrymples	1
and	1
ourselves.	1
Nothing	1
ever	1
happened	1
on	1
either	1
side	1
that	1
was	1
not	1
announced	1
immediately.	1
We	1
are	1
quite	1
near	1
relations,	1
you	1
know;	1
and	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
too,	1
whom	1
you	1
ought	1
so	1
particularly	1
to	1
be	1
acquainted	1
with!	1
Every	1
attention	1
is	1
due	1
to	1
Mr	1
Elliot.	1
Consider,	1
my	1
father's	1
heir:	1
the	1
future	1
representative	1
of	1
the	1
family."	1
"Don't	1
talk	1
to	1
me	1
about	1
heirs	1
and	1
representatives,"	1
cried	1
Charles.	1
"I	1
am	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
neglect	1
the	1
reigning	1
power	1
to	1
bow	1
to	1
the	1
rising	1
sun.	1
If	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
go	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
your	1
father,	1
I	1
should	1
think	1
it	1
scandalous	1
to	1
go	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
his	1
heir.	1
What	1
is	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
to	1
me?"	1
The	1
careless	1
expression	1
was	1
life	1
to	1
Anne,	1
who	1
saw	1
that	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
was	1
all	1
attention,	1
looking	1
and	1
listening	1
with	1
his	1
whole	1
soul;	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
last	1
words	1
brought	1
his	1
enquiring	1
eyes	1
from	1
Charles	1
to	1
herself.	1
Charles	1
and	1
Mary	1
still	1
talked	1
on	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
style;	1
he,	1
half	1
serious	1
and	1
half	1
jesting,	1
maintaining	1
the	1
scheme	1
for	1
the	1
play,	1
and	1
she,	1
invariably	1
serious,	1
most	1
warmly	1
opposing	1
it,	1
and	1
not	1
omitting	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
known	1
that,	1
however	1
determined	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
Camden	1
Place	1
herself,	1
she	1
should	1
not	1
think	1
herself	1
very	1
well	1
used,	1
if	1
they	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
play	1
without	1
her.	1
Mrs	1
Musgrove	1
interposed.	1
"We	1
had	1
better	1
put	1
it	1
off.	1
Charles,	1
you	1
had	1
much	1
better	1
go	1
back	1
and	1
change	1
the	1
box	1
for	1
Tuesday.	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
pity	1
to	1
be	1
divided,	1
and	1
we	1
should	1
be	1
losing	1
Miss	1
Anne,	1
too,	1
if	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
party	1
at	1
her	1
father's;	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
neither	1
Henrietta	1
nor	1
I	1
should	1
care	1
at	1
all	1
for	1
the	1
play,	1
if	1
Miss	1
Anne	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
with	1
us."	1
Anne	1
felt	1
truly	1
obliged	1
to	1
her	1
for	1
such	1
kindness;	1
and	1
quite	1
as	1
much	1
so	1
for	1
the	1
opportunity	1
it	1
gave	1
her	1
of	1
decidedly	1
saying--	1
"If	1
it	1
depended	1
only	1
on	1
my	1
inclination,	1
ma'am,	1
the	1
party	1
at	1
home	1
(excepting	1
on	1
Mary's	1
account)	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
the	1
smallest	1
impediment.	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
pleasure	1
in	1
the	1
sort	1
of	1
meeting,	1
and	1
should	1
be	1
too	1
happy	1
to	1
change	1
it	1
for	1
a	1
play,	1
and	1
with	1
you.	1
But,	1
it	1
had	1
better	1
not	1
be	1
attempted,	1
perhaps."	1
She	1
had	1
spoken	1
it;	1
but	1
she	1
trembled	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
done,	1
conscious	1
that	1
her	1
words	1
were	1
listened	1
to,	1
and	1
daring	1
not	1
even	1
to	1
try	1
to	1
observe	1
their	1
effect.	1
It	1
was	1
soon	1
generally	1
agreed	1
that	1
Tuesday	1
should	1
be	1
the	1
day;	1
Charles	1
only	1
reserving	1
the	1
advantage	1
of	1
still	1
teasing	1
his	1
wife,	1
by	1
persisting	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
play	1
to-morrow	1
if	1
nobody	1
else	1
would.	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
left	1
his	1
seat,	1
and	1
walked	1
to	1
the	1
fire-place;	1
probably	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
walking	1
away	1
from	1
it	1
soon	1
afterwards,	1
and	1
taking	1
a	1
station,	1
with	1
less	1
bare-faced	1
design,	1
by	1
Anne.	1
"You	1
have	1
not	1
been	1
long	1
enough	1
in	1
Bath,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"to	1
enjoy	1
the	1
evening	1
parties	1
of	1
the	1
place."	1
"Oh!	1
no.	1
The	1
usual	1
character	1
of	1
them	1
has	1
nothing	1
for	1
me.	1
I	1
am	1
no	1
card-player."	1
"You	1
were	1
not	1
formerly,	1
I	1
know.	1
You	1
did	1
not	1
use	1
to	1
like	1
cards;	1
but	1
time	1
makes	1
many	1
changes."	1
"I	1
am	1
not	1
yet	1
so	1
much	1
changed,"	1
cried	1
Anne,	1
and	1
stopped,	1
fearing	1
she	1
hardly	1
knew	1
what	1
misconstruction.	1
After	1
waiting	1
a	1
few	1
moments	1
he	1
said,	1
and	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
immediate	1
feeling,	1
"It	1
is	1
a	1
period,	1
indeed!	1
Eight	1
years	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
is	1
a	1
period."	1
Whether	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
proceeded	1
farther	1
was	1
left	1
to	1
Anne's	1
imagination	1
to	1
ponder	1
over	1
in	1
a	1
calmer	1
hour;	1
for	1
while	1
still	1
hearing	1
the	1
sounds	1
he	1
had	1
uttered,	1
she	1
was	1
startled	1
to	1
other	1
subjects	1
by	1
Henrietta,	1
eager	1
to	1
make	1
use	1
of	1
the	1
present	1
leisure	1
for	1
getting	1
out,	1
and	1
calling	1
on	1
her	1
companions	1
to	1
lose	1
no	1
time,	1
lest	1
somebody	1
else	1
should	1
come	1
in.	1
They	1
were	1
obliged	1
to	1
move.	1
Anne	1
talked	1
of	1
being	1
perfectly	1
ready,	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
look	1
it;	1
but	1
she	1
felt	1
that	1
could	1
Henrietta	1
have	1
known	1
the	1
regret	1
and	1
reluctance	1
of	1
her	1
heart	1
in	1
quitting	1
that	1
chair,	1
in	1
preparing	1
to	1
quit	1
the	1
room,	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
found,	1
in	1
all	1
her	1
own	1
sensations	1
for	1
her	1
cousin,	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
security	1
of	1
his	1
affection,	1
wherewith	1
to	1
pity	1
her.	1
Their	1
preparations,	1
however,	1
were	1
stopped	1
short.	1
Alarming	1
sounds	1
were	1
heard;	1
other	1
visitors	1
approached,	1
and	1
the	1
door	1
was	1
thrown	1
open	1
for	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
and	1
Miss	1
Elliot,	1
whose	1
entrance	1
seemed	1
to	1
give	1
a	1
general	1
chill.	1
Anne	1
felt	1
an	1
instant	1
oppression,	1
and	1
wherever	1
she	1
looked	1
saw	1
symptoms	1
of	1
the	1
same.	1
The	1
comfort,	1
the	1
freedom,	1
the	1
gaiety	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
was	1
over,	1
hushed	1
into	1
cold	1
composure,	1
determined	1
silence,	1
or	1
insipid	1
talk,	1
to	1
meet	1
the	1
heartless	1
elegance	1
of	1
her	1
father	1
and	1
sister.	1
How	1
mortifying	1
to	1
feel	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
so!	1
Her	1
jealous	1
eye	1
was	1
satisfied	1
in	1
one	1
particular.	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
was	1
acknowledged	1
again	1
by	1
each,	1
by	1
Elizabeth	1
more	1
graciously	1
than	1
before.	1
She	1
even	1
addressed	1
him	1
once,	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
more	1
than	1
once.	1
Elizabeth	1
was,	1
in	1
fact,	1
revolving	1
a	1
great	1
measure.	1
The	1
sequel	1
explained	1
it.	1
After	1
the	1
waste	1
of	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
in	1
saying	1
the	1
proper	1
nothings,	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
invitation	1
which	1
was	1
to	1
comprise	1
all	1
the	1
remaining	1
dues	1
of	1
the	1
Musgroves.	1
"To-morrow	1
evening,	1
to	1
meet	1
a	1
few	1
friends:	1
no	1
formal	1
party."	1
It	1
was	1
all	1
said	1
very	1
gracefully,	1
and	1
the	1
cards	1
with	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
provided	1
herself,	1
the	1
"Miss	1
Elliot	1
at	1
home,"	1
were	1
laid	1
on	1
the	1
table,	1
with	1
a	1
courteous,	1
comprehensive	1
smile	1
to	1
all,	1
and	1
one	1
smile	1
and	1
one	1
card	1
more	1
decidedly	1
for	1
Captain	1
Wentworth.	1
The	1
truth	1
was,	1
that	1
Elizabeth	1
had	1
been	1
long	1
enough	1
in	1
Bath	1
to	1
understand	1
the	1
importance	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
such	1
an	1
air	1
and	1
appearance	1
as	1
his.	1
The	1
past	1
was	1
nothing.	1
The	1
present	1
was	1
that	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
would	1
move	1
about	1
well	1
in	1
her	1
drawing-room.	1
The	1
card	1
was	1
pointedly	1
given,	1
and	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
arose	1
and	1
disappeared.	1
The	1
interruption	1
had	1
been	1
short,	1
though	1
severe,	1
and	1
ease	1
and	1
animation	1
returned	1
to	1
most	1
of	1
those	1
they	1
left	1
as	1
the	1
door	1
shut	1
them	1
out,	1
but	1
not	1
to	1
Anne.	1
She	1
could	1
think	1
only	1
of	1
the	1
invitation	1
she	1
had	1
with	1
such	1
astonishment	1
witnessed,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
manner	1
in	1
which	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
received;	1
a	1
manner	1
of	1
doubtful	1
meaning,	1
of	1
surprise	1
rather	1
than	1
gratification,	1
of	1
polite	1
acknowledgement	1
rather	1
than	1
acceptance.	1
She	1
knew	1
him;	1
she	1
saw	1
disdain	1
in	1
his	1
eye,	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
venture	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
determined	1
to	1
accept	1
such	1
an	1
offering,	1
as	1
an	1
atonement	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
insolence	1
of	1
the	1
past.	1
Her	1
spirits	1
sank.	1
He	1
held	1
the	1
card	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
after	1
they	1
were	1
gone,	1
as	1
if	1
deeply	1
considering	1
it.	1
"Only	1
think	1
of	1
Elizabeth's	1
including	1
everybody!"	1
whispered	1
Mary	1
very	1
audibly.	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
wonder	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
is	1
delighted!	1
You	1
see	1
he	1
cannot	1
put	1
the	1
card	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
hand."	1
Anne	1
caught	1
his	1
eye,	1
saw	1
his	1
cheeks	1
glow,	1
and	1
his	1
mouth	1
form	1
itself	1
into	1
a	1
momentary	1
expression	1
of	1
contempt,	1
and	1
turned	1
away,	1
that	1
she	1
might	1
neither	1
see	1
nor	1
hear	1
more	1
to	1
vex	1
her.	1
The	1
party	1
separated.	1
The	1
gentlemen	1
had	1
their	1
own	1
pursuits,	1
the	1
ladies	1
proceeded	1
on	1
their	1
own	1
business,	1
and	1
they	1
met	1
no	1
more	1
while	1
Anne	1
belonged	1
to	1
them.	1
She	1
was	1
earnestly	1
begged	1
to	1
return	1
and	1
dine,	1
and	1
give	1
them	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
day,	1
but	1
her	1
spirits	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
long	1
exerted	1
that	1
at	1
present	1
she	1
felt	1
unequal	1
to	1
more,	1
and	1
fit	1
only	1
for	1
home,	1
where	1
she	1
might	1
be	1
sure	1
of	1
being	1
as	1
silent	1
as	1
she	1
chose.	1
Promising	1
to	1
be	1
with	1
them	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
the	1
following	1
morning,	1
therefore,	1
she	1
closed	1
the	1
fatigues	1
of	1
the	1
present	1
by	1
a	1
toilsome	1
walk	1
to	1
Camden	1
Place,	1
there	1
to	1
spend	1
the	1
evening	1
chiefly	1
in	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
busy	1
arrangements	1
of	1
Elizabeth	1
and	1
Mrs	1
Clay	1
for	1
the	1
morrow's	1
party,	1
the	1
frequent	1
enumeration	1
of	1
the	1
persons	1
invited,	1
and	1
the	1
continually	1
improving	1
detail	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
embellishments	1
which	1
were	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
the	1
most	1
completely	1
elegant	1
of	1
its	1
kind	1
in	1
Bath,	1
while	1
harassing	1
herself	1
with	1
the	1
never-ending	1
question,	1
of	1
whether	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
would	1
come	1
or	1
not?	1
They	1
were	1
reckoning	1
him	1
as	1
certain,	1
but	1
with	1
her	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
gnawing	1
solicitude	1
never	1
appeased	1
for	1
five	1
minutes	1
together.	1
She	1
generally	1
thought	1
he	1
would	1
come,	1
because	1
she	1
generally	1
thought	1
he	1
ought;	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
case	1
which	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
so	1
shape	1
into	1
any	1
positive	1
act	1
of	1
duty	1
or	1
discretion,	1
as	1
inevitably	1
to	1
defy	1
the	1
suggestions	1
of	1
very	1
opposite	1
feelings.	1
She	1
only	1
roused	1
herself	1
from	1
the	1
broodings	1
of	1
this	1
restless	1
agitation,	1
to	1
let	1
Mrs	1
Clay	1
know	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
seen	1
with	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
three	1
hours	1
after	1
his	1
being	1
supposed	1
to	1
be	1
out	1
of	1
Bath,	1
for	1
having	1
watched	1
in	1
vain	1
for	1
some	1
intimation	1
of	1
the	1
interview	1
from	1
the	1
lady	1
herself,	1
she	1
determined	1
to	1
mention	1
it,	1
and	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
there	1
was	1
guilt	1
in	1
Mrs	1
Clay's	1
face	1
as	1
she	1
listened.	1
It	1
was	1
transient:	1
cleared	1
away	1
in	1
an	1
instant;	1
but	1
Anne	1
could	1
imagine	1
she	1
read	1
there	1
the	1
consciousness	1
of	1
having,	1
by	1
some	1
complication	1
of	1
mutual	1
trick,	1
or	1
some	1
overbearing	1
authority	1
of	1
his,	1
been	1
obliged	1
to	1
attend	1
(perhaps	1
for	1
half	1
an	1
hour)	1
to	1
his	1
lectures	1
and	1
restrictions	1
on	1
her	1
designs	1
on	1
Sir	1
Walter.	1
She	1
exclaimed,	1
however,	1
with	1
a	1
very	1
tolerable	1
imitation	1
of	1
nature:	1
--	1
"Oh!	1
dear!	1
very	1
true.	1
Only	1
think,	1
Miss	1
Elliot,	1
to	1
my	1
great	1
surprise	1
I	1
met	1
with	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
in	1
Bath	1
Street.	1
I	1
was	1
never	1
more	1
astonished.	1
He	1
turned	1
back	1
and	1
walked	1
with	1
me	1
to	1
the	1
Pump	1
Yard.	1
He	1
had	1
been	1
prevented	1
setting	1
off	1
for	1
Thornberry,	1
but	1
I	1
really	1
forget	1
by	1
what;	1
for	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
hurry,	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
much	1
attend,	1
and	1
I	1
can	1
only	1
answer	1
for	1
his	1
being	1
determined	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
delayed	1
in	1
his	1
return.	1
He	1
wanted	1
to	1
know	1
how	1
early	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
admitted	1
to-morrow.	1
He	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
`to-morrow,'	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
evident	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
full	1
of	1
it	1
too,	1
ever	1
since	1
I	1
entered	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
learnt	1
the	1
extension	1
of	1
your	1
plan	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
happened,	1
or	1
my	1
seeing	1
him	1
could	1
never	1
have	1
gone	1
so	1
entirely	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
head."	1
Chapter	1
23	1
One	1
day	1
only	1
had	1
passed	1
since	1
Anne's	1
conversation	1
with	1
Mrs	1
Smith;	1
but	1
a	1
keener	1
interest	1
had	1
succeeded,	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
now	1
so	1
little	1
touched	1
by	1
Mr	1
Elliot's	1
conduct,	1
except	1
by	1
its	1
effects	1
in	1
one	1
quarter,	1
that	1
it	1
became	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
course	1
the	1
next	1
morning,	1
still	1
to	1
defer	1
her	1
explanatory	1
visit	1
in	1
Rivers	1
Street.	1
She	1
had	1
promised	1
to	1
be	1
with	1
the	1
Musgroves	1
from	1
breakfast	1
to	1
dinner.	1
Her	1
faith	1
was	1
plighted,	1
and	1
Mr	1
Elliot's	1
character,	1
like	1
the	1
Sultaness	1
Scheherazade's	1
head,	1
must	1
live	1
another	1
day.	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
keep	1
her	1
appointment	1
punctually,	1
however;	1
the	1
weather	1
was	1
unfavourable,	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
grieved	1
over	1
the	1
rain	1
on	1
her	1
friends'	1
account,	1
and	1
felt	1
it	1
very	1
much	1
on	1
her	1
own,	1
before	1
she	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
attempt	1
the	1
walk.	1
When	1
she	1
reached	1
the	1
White	1
Hart,	1
and	1
made	1
her	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
proper	1
apartment,	1
she	1
found	1
herself	1
neither	1
arriving	1
quite	1
in	1
time,	1
nor	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
arrive.	1
The	1
party	1
before	1
her	1
were,	1
Mrs	1
Musgrove,	1
talking	1
to	1
Mrs	1
Croft,	1
and	1
Captain	1
Harville	1
to	1
Captain	1
Wentworth;	1
and	1
she	1
immediately	1
heard	1
that	1
Mary	1
and	1
Henrietta,	1
too	1
impatient	1
to	1
wait,	1
had	1
gone	1
out	1
the	1
moment	1
it	1
had	1
cleared,	1
but	1
would	1
be	1
back	1
again	1
soon,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
strictest	1
injunctions	1
had	1
been	1
left	1
with	1
Mrs	1
Musgrove	1
to	1
keep	1
her	1
there	1
till	1
they	1
returned.	1
She	1
had	1
only	1
to	1
submit,	1
sit	1
down,	1
be	1
outwardly	1
composed,	1
and	1
feel	1
herself	1
plunged	1
at	1
once	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
agitations	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
merely	1
laid	1
her	1
account	1
of	1
tasting	1
a	1
little	1
before	1
the	1
morning	1
closed.	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
delay,	1
no	1
waste	1
of	1
time.	1
She	1
was	1
deep	1
in	1
the	1
happiness	1
of	1
such	1
misery,	1
or	1
the	1
misery	1
of	1
such	1
happiness,	1
instantly.	1
Two	1
minutes	1
after	1
her	1
entering	1
the	1
room,	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
said--	1
"We	1
will	1
write	1
the	1
letter	1
we	1
were	1
talking	1
of,	1
Harville,	1
now,	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
give	1
me	1
materials."	1
Materials	1
were	1
at	1
hand,	1
on	1
a	1
separate	1
table;	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
it,	1
and	1
nearly	1
turning	1
his	1
back	1
to	1
them	1
all,	1
was	1
engrossed	1
by	1
writing.	1
Mrs	1
Musgrove	1
was	1
giving	1
Mrs	1
Croft	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
her	1
eldest	1
daughter's	1
engagement,	1
and	1
just	1
in	1
that	1
inconvenient	1
tone	1
of	1
voice	1
which	1
was	1
perfectly	1
audible	1
while	1
it	1
pretended	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
whisper.	1
Anne	1
felt	1
that	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
belong	1
to	1
the	1
conversation,	1
and	1
yet,	1
as	1
Captain	1
Harville	1
seemed	1
thoughtful	1
and	1
not	1
disposed	1
to	1
talk,	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
avoid	1
hearing	1
many	1
undesirable	1
particulars;	1
such	1
as,	1
"how	1
Mr	1
Musgrove	1
and	1
my	1
brother	1
Hayter	1
had	1
met	1
again	1
and	1
again	1
to	1
talk	1
it	1
over;	1
what	1
my	1
brother	1
Hayter	1
had	1
said	1
one	1
day,	1
and	1
what	1
Mr	1
Musgrove	1
had	1
proposed	1
the	1
next,	1
and	1
what	1
had	1
occurred	1
to	1
my	1
sister	1
Hayter,	1
and	1
what	1
the	1
young	1
people	1
had	1
wished,	1
and	1
what	1
I	1
said	1
at	1
first	1
I	1
never	1
could	1
consent	1
to,	1
but	1
was	1
afterwards	1
persuaded	1
to	1
think	1
might	1
do	1
very	1
well,"	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
style	1
of	1
open-hearted	1
communication:	1
minutiae	1
which,	1
even	1
with	1
every	1
advantage	1
of	1
taste	1
and	1
delicacy,	1
which	1
good	1
Mrs	1
Musgrove	1
could	1
not	1
give,	1
could	1
be	1
properly	1
interesting	1
only	1
to	1
the	1
principals.	1
Mrs	1
Croft	1
was	1
attending	1
with	1
great	1
good-humour,	1
and	1
whenever	1
she	1
spoke	1
at	1
all,	1
it	1
was	1
very	1
sensibly.	1
Anne	1
hoped	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
might	1
each	1
be	1
too	1
much	1
self-occupied	1
to	1
hear.	1
"And	1
so,	1
ma'am,	1
all	1
these	1
thing	1
considered,"	1
said	1
Mrs	1
Musgrove,	1
in	1
her	1
powerful	1
whisper,	1
"though	1
we	1
could	1
have	1
wished	1
it	1
different,	1
yet,	1
altogether,	1
we	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
it	1
fair	1
to	1
stand	1
out	1
any	1
longer,	1
for	1
Charles	1
Hayter	1
was	1
quite	1
wild	1
about	1
it,	1
and	1
Henrietta	1
was	1
pretty	1
near	1
as	1
bad;	1
and	1
so	1
we	1
thought	1
they	1
had	1
better	1
marry	1
at	1
once,	1
and	1
make	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
it,	1
as	1
many	1
others	1
have	1
done	1
before	1
them.	1
At	1
any	1
rate,	1
said	1
I,	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
better	1
than	1
a	1
long	1
engagement."	1
"That	1
is	1
precisely	1
what	1
I	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
observe,"	1
cried	1
Mrs	1
Croft.	1
"I	1
would	1
rather	1
have	1
young	1
people	1
settle	1
on	1
a	1
small	1
income	1
at	1
once,	1
and	1
have	1
to	1
struggle	1
with	1
a	1
few	1
difficulties	1
together,	1
than	1
be	1
involved	1
in	1
a	1
long	1
engagement.	1
I	1
always	1
think	1
that	1
no	1
mutual--"	1
"Oh!	1
dear	1
Mrs	1
Croft,"	1
cried	1
Mrs	1
Musgrove,	1
unable	1
to	1
let	1
her	1
finish	1
her	1
speech,	1
"there	1
is	1
nothing	1
I	1
so	1
abominate	1
for	1
young	1
people	1
as	1
a	1
long	1
engagement.	1
It	1
is	1
what	1
I	1
always	1
protested	1
against	1
for	1
my	1
children.	1
It	1
is	1
all	1
very	1
well,	1
I	1
used	1
to	1
say,	1
for	1
young	1
people	1
to	1
be	1
engaged,	1
if	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
certainty	1
of	1
their	1
being	1
able	1
to	1
marry	1
in	1
six	1
months,	1
or	1
even	1
in	1
twelve;	1
but	1
a	1
long	1
engagement--"	1
"Yes,	1
dear	1
ma'am,"	1
said	1
Mrs	1
Croft,	1
"or	1
an	1
uncertain	1
engagement,	1
an	1
engagement	1
which	1
may	1
be	1
long.	1
To	1
begin	1
without	1
knowing	1
that	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
time	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
marrying,	1
I	1
hold	1
to	1
be	1
very	1
unsafe	1
and	1
unwise,	1
and	1
what	1
I	1
think	1
all	1
parents	1
should	1
prevent	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
they	1
can."	1
Anne	1
found	1
an	1
unexpected	1
interest	1
here.	1
She	1
felt	1
its	1
application	1
to	1
herself,	1
felt	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
nervous	1
thrill	1
all	1
over	1
her;	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
moment	1
that	1
her	1
eyes	1
instinctively	1
glanced	1
towards	1
the	1
distant	1
table,	1
Captain	1
Wentworth's	1
pen	1
ceased	1
to	1
move,	1
his	1
head	1
was	1
raised,	1
pausing,	1
listening,	1
and	1
he	1
turned	1
round	1
the	1
next	1
instant	1
to	1
give	1
a	1
look,	1
one	1
quick,	1
conscious	1
look	1
at	1
her.	1
The	1
two	1
ladies	1
continued	1
to	1
talk,	1
to	1
re-urge	1
the	1
same	1
admitted	1
truths,	1
and	1
enforce	1
them	1
with	1
such	1
examples	1
of	1
the	1
ill	1
effect	1
of	1
a	1
contrary	1
practice	1
as	1
had	1
fallen	1
within	1
their	1
observation,	1
but	1
Anne	1
heard	1
nothing	1
distinctly;	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
a	1
buzz	1
of	1
words	1
in	1
her	1
ear,	1
her	1
mind	1
was	1
in	1
confusion.	1
Captain	1
Harville,	1
who	1
had	1
in	1
truth	1
been	1
hearing	1
none	1
of	1
it,	1
now	1
left	1
his	1
seat,	1
and	1
moved	1
to	1
a	1
window,	1
and	1
Anne	1
seeming	1
to	1
watch	1
him,	1
though	1
it	1
was	1
from	1
thorough	1
absence	1
of	1
mind,	1
became	1
gradually	1
sensible	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
inviting	1
her	1
to	1
join	1
him	1
where	1
he	1
stood.	1
He	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
with	1
a	1
smile,	1
and	1
a	1
little	1
motion	1
of	1
the	1
head,	1
which	1
expressed,	1
"Come	1
to	1
me,	1
I	1
have	1
something	1
to	1
say;"	1
and	1
the	1
unaffected,	1
easy	1
kindness	1
of	1
manner	1
which	1
denoted	1
the	1
feelings	1
of	1
an	1
older	1
acquaintance	1
than	1
he	1
really	1
was,	1
strongly	1
enforced	1
the	1
invitation.	1
She	1
roused	1
herself	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
him.	1
The	1
window	1
at	1
which	1
he	1
stood	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
from	1
where	1
the	1
two	1
ladies	1
were	1
sitting,	1
and	1
though	1
nearer	1
to	1
Captain	1
Wentworth's	1
table,	1
not	1
very	1
near.	1
As	1
she	1
joined	1
him,	1
Captain	1
Harville's	1
countenance	1
re-assumed	1
the	1
serious,	1
thoughtful	1
expression	1
which	1
seemed	1
its	1
natural	1
character.	1
"Look	1
here,"	1
said	1
he,	1
unfolding	1
a	1
parcel	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
displaying	1
a	1
small	1
miniature	1
painting,	1
"do	1
you	1
know	1
who	1
that	1
is?"	1
"Certainly:	1
Captain	1
Benwick."	1
"Yes,	1
and	1
you	1
may	1
guess	1
who	1
it	1
is	1
for.	1
But,"	1
(in	1
a	1
deep	1
tone,)	1
"it	1
was	1
not	1
done	1
for	1
her.	1
Miss	1
Elliot,	1
do	1
you	1
remember	1
our	1
walking	1
together	1
at	1
Lyme,	1
and	1
grieving	1
for	1
him?	1
I	1
little	1
thought	1
then--	1
but	1
no	1
matter.	1
This	1
was	1
drawn	1
at	1
the	1
Cape.	1
He	1
met	1
with	1
a	1
clever	1
young	1
German	1
artist	1
at	1
the	1
Cape,	1
and	1
in	1
compliance	1
with	1
a	1
promise	1
to	1
my	1
poor	1
sister,	1
sat	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
was	1
bringing	1
it	1
home	1
for	1
her;	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
now	1
the	1
charge	1
of	1
getting	1
it	1
properly	1
set	1
for	1
another!	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
commission	1
to	1
me!	1
But	1
who	1
else	1
was	1
there	1
to	1
employ?	1
I	1
hope	1
I	1
can	1
allow	1
for	1
him.	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
sorry,	1
indeed,	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
over	1
to	1
another.	1
He	1
undertakes	1
it;"	1
(looking	1
towards	1
Captain	1
Wentworth,)	1
"he	1
is	1
writing	1
about	1
it	1
now."	1
And	1
with	1
a	1
quivering	1
lip	1
he	1
wound	1
up	1
the	1
whole	1
by	1
adding,	1
"Poor	1
Fanny!	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
forgotten	1
him	1
so	1
soon!"	1
"No,"	1
replied	1
Anne,	1
in	1
a	1
low,	1
feeling	1
voice.	1
"That	1
I	1
can	1
easily	1
believe."	1
"It	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
her	1
nature.	1
She	1
doted	1
on	1
him."	1
"It	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
any	1
woman	1
who	1
truly	1
loved."	1
Captain	1
Harville	1
smiled,	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
to	1
say,	1
"Do	1
you	1
claim	1
that	1
for	1
your	1
sex?"	1
and	1
she	1
answered	1
the	1
question,	1
smiling	1
also,	1
"Yes.	1
We	1
certainly	1
do	1
not	1
forget	1
you	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
you	1
forget	1
us.	1
It	1
is,	1
perhaps,	1
our	1
fate	1
rather	1
than	1
our	1
merit.	1
We	1
cannot	1
help	1
ourselves.	1
We	1
live	1
at	1
home,	1
quiet,	1
confined,	1
and	1
our	1
feelings	1
prey	1
upon	1
us.	1
You	1
are	1
forced	1
on	1
exertion.	1
You	1
have	1
always	1
a	1
profession,	1
pursuits,	1
business	1
of	1
some	1
sort	1
or	1
other,	1
to	1
take	1
you	1
back	1
into	1
the	1
world	1
immediately,	1
and	1
continual	1
occupation	1
and	1
change	1
soon	1
weaken	1
impressions."	1
"Granting	1
your	1
assertion	1
that	1
the	1
world	1
does	1
all	1
this	1
so	1
soon	1
for	1
men	1
(which,	1
however,	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
I	1
shall	1
grant),	1
it	1
does	1
not	1
apply	1
to	1
Benwick.	1
He	1
has	1
not	1
been	1
forced	1
upon	1
any	1
exertion.	1
The	1
peace	1
turned	1
him	1
on	1
shore	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
moment,	1
and	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
living	1
with	1
us,	1
in	1
our	1
little	1
family	1
circle,	1
ever	1
since."	1
"True,"	1
said	1
Anne,	1
"very	1
true;	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
recollect;	1
but	1
what	1
shall	1
we	1
say	1
now,	1
Captain	1
Harville?	1
If	1
the	1
change	1
be	1
not	1
from	1
outward	1
circumstances,	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
from	1
within;	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
nature,	1
man's	1
nature,	1
which	1
has	1
done	1
the	1
business	1
for	1
Captain	1
Benwick."	1
"No,	1
no,	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
man's	1
nature.	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
allow	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
more	1
man's	1
nature	1
than	1
woman's	1
to	1
be	1
inconstant	1
and	1
forget	1
those	1
they	1
do	1
love,	1
or	1
have	1
loved.	1
I	1
believe	1
the	1
reverse.	1
I	1
believe	1
in	1
a	1
true	1
analogy	1
between	1
our	1
bodily	1
frames	1
and	1
our	1
mental;	1
and	1
that	1
as	1
our	1
bodies	1
are	1
the	1
strongest,	1
so	1
are	1
our	1
feelings;	1
capable	1
of	1
bearing	1
most	1
rough	1
usage,	1
and	1
riding	1
out	1
the	1
heaviest	1
weather."	1
"Your	1
feelings	1
may	1
be	1
the	1
strongest,"	1
replied	1
Anne,	1
"but	1
the	1
same	1
spirit	1
of	1
analogy	1
will	1
authorise	1
me	1
to	1
assert	1
that	1
ours	1
are	1
the	1
most	1
tender.	1
Man	1
is	1
more	1
robust	1
than	1
woman,	1
but	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
longer	1
lived;	1
which	1
exactly	1
explains	1
my	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
their	1
attachments.	1
Nay,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
too	1
hard	1
upon	1
you,	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
otherwise.	1
You	1
have	1
difficulties,	1
and	1
privations,	1
and	1
dangers	1
enough	1
to	1
struggle	1
with.	1
You	1
are	1
always	1
labouring	1
and	1
toiling,	1
exposed	1
to	1
every	1
risk	1
and	1
hardship.	1
Your	1
home,	1
country,	1
friends,	1
all	1
quitted.	1
Neither	1
time,	1
nor	1
health,	1
nor	1
life,	1
to	1
be	1
called	1
your	1
own.	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
hard,	1
indeed"	1
(with	1
a	1
faltering	1
voice),	1
"if	1
woman's	1
feelings	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
added	1
to	1
all	1
this."	1
"We	1
shall	1
never	1
agree	1
upon	1
this	1
question,"	1
Captain	1
Harville	1
was	1
beginning	1
to	1
say,	1
when	1
a	1
slight	1
noise	1
called	1
their	1
attention	1
to	1
Captain	1
Wentworth's	1
hitherto	1
perfectly	1
quiet	1
division	1
of	1
the	1
room.	1
It	1
was	1
nothing	1
more	1
than	1
that	1
his	1
pen	1
had	1
fallen	1
down;	1
but	1
Anne	1
was	1
startled	1
at	1
finding	1
him	1
nearer	1
than	1
she	1
had	1
supposed,	1
and	1
half	1
inclined	1
to	1
suspect	1
that	1
the	1
pen	1
had	1
only	1
fallen	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
occupied	1
by	1
them,	1
striving	1
to	1
catch	1
sounds,	1
which	1
yet	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
he	1
could	1
have	1
caught.	1
"Have	1
you	1
finished	1
your	1
letter?"	1
said	1
Captain	1
Harville.	1
"Not	1
quite,	1
a	1
few	1
lines	1
more.	1
I	1
shall	1
have	1
done	1
in	1
five	1
minutes."	1
"There	1
is	1
no	1
hurry	1
on	1
my	1
side.	1
I	1
am	1
only	1
ready	1
whenever	1
you	1
are.	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
very	1
good	1
anchorage	1
here,"	1
(smiling	1
at	1
Anne,)	1
"well	1
supplied,	1
and	1
want	1
for	1
nothing.	1
No	1
hurry	1
for	1
a	1
signal	1
at	1
all.	1
Well,	1
Miss	1
Elliot,"	1
(lowering	1
his	1
voice,)	1
"as	1
I	1
was	1
saying	1
we	1
shall	1
never	1
agree,	1
I	1
suppose,	1
upon	1
this	1
point.	1
No	1
man	1
and	1
woman,	1
would,	1
probably.	1
But	1
let	1
me	1
observe	1
that	1
all	1
histories	1
are	1
against	1
you--all	1
stories,	1
prose	1
and	1
verse.	1
If	1
I	1
had	1
such	1
a	1
memory	1
as	1
Benwick,	1
I	1
could	1
bring	1
you	1
fifty	1
quotations	1
in	1
a	1
moment	1
on	1
my	1
side	1
the	1
argument,	1
and	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
I	1
ever	1
opened	1
a	1
book	1
in	1
my	1
life	1
which	1
had	1
not	1
something	1
to	1
say	1
upon	1
woman's	1
inconstancy.	1
Songs	1
and	1
proverbs,	1
all	1
talk	1
of	1
woman's	1
fickleness.	1
But	1
perhaps	1
you	1
will	1
say,	1
these	1
were	1
all	1
written	1
by	1
men."	1
"Perhaps	1
I	1
shall.	1
Yes,	1
yes,	1
if	1
you	1
please,	1
no	1
reference	1
to	1
examples	1
in	1
books.	1
Men	1
have	1
had	1
every	1
advantage	1
of	1
us	1
in	1
telling	1
their	1
own	1
story.	1
Education	1
has	1
been	1
theirs	1
in	1
so	1
much	1
higher	1
a	1
degree;	1
the	1
pen	1
has	1
been	1
in	1
their	1
hands.	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
allow	1
books	1
to	1
prove	1
anything."	1
"But	1
how	1
shall	1
we	1
prove	1
anything?"	1
"We	1
never	1
shall.	1
We	1
never	1
can	1
expect	1
to	1
prove	1
any	1
thing	1
upon	1
such	1
a	1
point.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
difference	1
of	1
opinion	1
which	1
does	1
not	1
admit	1
of	1
proof.	1
We	1
each	1
begin,	1
probably,	1
with	1
a	1
little	1
bias	1
towards	1
our	1
own	1
sex;	1
and	1
upon	1
that	1
bias	1
build	1
every	1
circumstance	1
in	1
favour	1
of	1
it	1
which	1
has	1
occurred	1
within	1
our	1
own	1
circle;	1
many	1
of	1
which	1
circumstances	1
(perhaps	1
those	1
very	1
cases	1
which	1
strike	1
us	1
the	1
most)	1
may	1
be	1
precisely	1
such	1
as	1
cannot	1
be	1
brought	1
forward	1
without	1
betraying	1
a	1
confidence,	1
or	1
in	1
some	1
respect	1
saying	1
what	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
said."	1
"Ah!"	1
cried	1
Captain	1
Harville,	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
of	1
strong	1
feeling,	1
"if	1
I	1
could	1
but	1
make	1
you	1
comprehend	1
what	1
a	1
man	1
suffers	1
when	1
he	1
takes	1
a	1
last	1
look	1
at	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
children,	1
and	1
watches	1
the	1
boat	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
sent	1
them	1
off	1
in,	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
sight,	1
and	1
then	1
turns	1
away	1
and	1
says,	1
`God	1
knows	1
whether	1
we	1
ever	1
meet	1
again!'	1
And	1
then,	1
if	1
I	1
could	1
convey	1
to	1
you	1
the	1
glow	1
of	1
his	1
soul	1
when	1
he	1
does	1
see	1
them	1
again;	1
when,	1
coming	1
back	1
after	1
a	1
twelvemonth's	1
absence,	1
perhaps,	1
and	1
obliged	1
to	1
put	1
into	1
another	1
port,	1
he	1
calculates	1
how	1
soon	1
it	1
be	1
possible	1
to	1
get	1
them	1
there,	1
pretending	1
to	1
deceive	1
himself,	1
and	1
saying,	1
`They	1
cannot	1
be	1
here	1
till	1
such	1
a	1
day,'	1
but	1
all	1
the	1
while	1
hoping	1
for	1
them	1
twelve	1
hours	1
sooner,	1
and	1
seeing	1
them	1
arrive	1
at	1
last,	1
as	1
if	1
Heaven	1
had	1
given	1
them	1
wings,	1
by	1
many	1
hours	1
sooner	1
still!	1
If	1
I	1
could	1
explain	1
to	1
you	1
all	1
this,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
can	1
bear	1
and	1
do,	1
and	1
glories	1
to	1
do,	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
these	1
treasures	1
of	1
his	1
existence!	1
I	1
speak,	1
you	1
know,	1
only	1
of	1
such	1
men	1
as	1
have	1
hearts!"	1
pressing	1
his	1
own	1
with	1
emotion.	1
"Oh!"	1
cried	1
Anne	1
eagerly,	1
"I	1
hope	1
I	1
do	1
justice	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
felt	1
by	1
you,	1
and	1
by	1
those	1
who	1
resemble	1
you.	1
God	1
forbid	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
undervalue	1
the	1
warm	1
and	1
faithful	1
feelings	1
of	1
any	1
of	1
my	1
fellow-creatures!	1
I	1
should	1
deserve	1
utter	1
contempt	1
if	1
I	1
dared	1
to	1
suppose	1
that	1
true	1
attachment	1
and	1
constancy	1
were	1
known	1
only	1
by	1
woman.	1
No,	1
I	1
believe	1
you	1
capable	1
of	1
everything	1
great	1
and	1
good	1
in	1
your	1
married	1
lives.	1
I	1
believe	1
you	1
equal	1
to	1
every	1
important	1
exertion,	1
and	1
to	1
every	1
domestic	1
forbearance,	1
so	1
long	1
as--if	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
allowed	1
the	1
expression--so	1
long	1
as	1
you	1
have	1
an	1
object.	1
I	1
mean	1
while	1
the	1
woman	1
you	1
love	1
lives,	1
and	1
lives	1
for	1
you.	1
All	1
the	1
privilege	1
I	1
claim	1
for	1
my	1
own	1
sex	1
(it	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
very	1
enviable	1
one;	1
you	1
need	1
not	1
covet	1
it),	1
is	1
that	1
of	1
loving	1
longest,	1
when	1
existence	1
or	1
when	1
hope	1
is	1
gone."	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
immediately	1
have	1
uttered	1
another	1
sentence;	1
her	1
heart	1
was	1
too	1
full,	1
her	1
breath	1
too	1
much	1
oppressed.	1
"You	1
are	1
a	1
good	1
soul,"	1
cried	1
Captain	1
Harville,	1
putting	1
his	1
hand	1
on	1
her	1
arm,	1
quite	1
affectionately.	1
"There	1
is	1
no	1
quarrelling	1
with	1
you.	1
And	1
when	1
I	1
think	1
of	1
Benwick,	1
my	1
tongue	1
is	1
tied."	1
Their	1
attention	1
was	1
called	1
towards	1
the	1
others.	1
Mrs	1
Croft	1
was	1
taking	1
leave.	1
"Here,	1
Frederick,	1
you	1
and	1
I	1
part	1
company,	1
I	1
believe,"	1
said	1
she.	1
"I	1
am	1
going	1
home,	1
and	1
you	1
have	1
an	1
engagement	1
with	1
your	1
friend.	1
To-night	1
we	1
may	1
have	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
all	1
meeting	1
again	1
at	1
your	1
party,"	1
(turning	1
to	1
Anne.)	1
"We	1
had	1
your	1
sister's	1
card	1
yesterday,	1
and	1
I	1
understood	1
Frederick	1
had	1
a	1
card	1
too,	1
though	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
it;	1
and	1
you	1
are	1
disengaged,	1
Frederick,	1
are	1
you	1
not,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
ourselves?"	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
was	1
folding	1
up	1
a	1
letter	1
in	1
great	1
haste,	1
and	1
either	1
could	1
not	1
or	1
would	1
not	1
answer	1
fully.	1
"Yes,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"very	1
true;	1
here	1
we	1
separate,	1
but	1
Harville	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
soon	1
be	1
after	1
you;	1
that	1
is,	1
Harville,	1
if	1
you	1
are	1
ready,	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
half	1
a	1
minute.	1
I	1
know	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
sorry	1
to	1
be	1
off.	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
at	1
your	1
service	1
in	1
half	1
a	1
minute."	1
Mrs	1
Croft	1
left	1
them,	1
and	1
Captain	1
Wentworth,	1
having	1
sealed	1
his	1
letter	1
with	1
great	1
rapidity,	1
was	1
indeed	1
ready,	1
and	1
had	1
even	1
a	1
hurried,	1
agitated	1
air,	1
which	1
shewed	1
impatience	1
to	1
be	1
gone.	1
Anne	1
knew	1
not	1
how	1
to	1
understand	1
it.	1
She	1
had	1
the	1
kindest	1
"Good	1
morning,	1
God	1
bless	1
you!"	1
from	1
Captain	1
Harville,	1
but	1
from	1
him	1
not	1
a	1
word,	1
nor	1
a	1
look!	1
He	1
had	1
passed	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
without	1
a	1
look!	1
She	1
had	1
only	1
time,	1
however,	1
to	1
move	1
closer	1
to	1
the	1
table	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
writing,	1
when	1
footsteps	1
were	1
heard	1
returning;	1
the	1
door	1
opened,	1
it	1
was	1
himself.	1
He	1
begged	1
their	1
pardon,	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
forgotten	1
his	1
gloves,	1
and	1
instantly	1
crossing	1
the	1
room	1
to	1
the	1
writing	1
table,	1
he	1
drew	1
out	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
under	1
the	1
scattered	1
paper,	1
placed	1
it	1
before	1
Anne	1
with	1
eyes	1
of	1
glowing	1
entreaty	1
fixed	1
on	1
her	1
for	1
a	1
time,	1
and	1
hastily	1
collecting	1
his	1
gloves,	1
was	1
again	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room,	1
almost	1
before	1
Mrs	1
Musgrove	1
was	1
aware	1
of	1
his	1
being	1
in	1
it:	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
an	1
instant!	1
The	1
revolution	1
which	1
one	1
instant	1
had	1
made	1
in	1
Anne,	1
was	1
almost	1
beyond	1
expression.	1
The	1
letter,	1
with	1
a	1
direction	1
hardly	1
legible,	1
to	1
"Miss	1
A.	1
E.--,"	1
was	1
evidently	1
the	1
one	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
folding	1
so	1
hastily.	1
While	1
supposed	1
to	1
be	1
writing	1
only	1
to	1
Captain	1
Benwick,	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
also	1
addressing	1
her!	1
On	1
the	1
contents	1
of	1
that	1
letter	1
depended	1
all	1
which	1
this	1
world	1
could	1
do	1
for	1
her.	1
Anything	1
was	1
possible,	1
anything	1
might	1
be	1
defied	1
rather	1
than	1
suspense.	1
Mrs	1
Musgrove	1
had	1
little	1
arrangements	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
at	1
her	1
own	1
table;	1
to	1
their	1
protection	1
she	1
must	1
trust,	1
and	1
sinking	1
into	1
the	1
chair	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
occupied,	1
succeeding	1
to	1
the	1
very	1
spot	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
leaned	1
and	1
written,	1
her	1
eyes	1
devoured	1
the	1
following	1
words:	1
"I	1
can	1
listen	1
no	1
longer	1
in	1
silence.	1
I	1
must	1
speak	1
to	1
you	1
by	1
such	1
means	1
as	1
are	1
within	1
my	1
reach.	1
You	1
pierce	1
my	1
soul.	1
I	1
am	1
half	1
agony,	1
half	1
hope.	1
Tell	1
me	1
not	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
too	1
late,	1
that	1
such	1
precious	1
feelings	1
are	1
gone	1
for	1
ever.	1
I	1
offer	1
myself	1
to	1
you	1
again	1
with	1
a	1
heart	1
even	1
more	1
your	1
own	1
than	1
when	1
you	1
almost	1
broke	1
it,	1
eight	1
years	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
ago.	1
Dare	1
not	1
say	1
that	1
man	1
forgets	1
sooner	1
than	1
woman,	1
that	1
his	1
love	1
has	1
an	1
earlier	1
death.	1
I	1
have	1
loved	1
none	1
but	1
you.	1
Unjust	1
I	1
may	1
have	1
been,	1
weak	1
and	1
resentful	1
I	1
have	1
been,	1
but	1
never	1
inconstant.	1
You	1
alone	1
have	1
brought	1
me	1
to	1
Bath.	1
For	1
you	1
alone,	1
I	1
think	1
and	1
plan.	1
Have	1
you	1
not	1
seen	1
this?	1
Can	1
you	1
fail	1
to	1
have	1
understood	1
my	1
wishes?	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
waited	1
even	1
these	1
ten	1
days,	1
could	1
I	1
have	1
read	1
your	1
feelings,	1
as	1
I	1
think	1
you	1
must	1
have	1
penetrated	1
mine.	1
I	1
can	1
hardly	1
write.	1
I	1
am	1
every	1
instant	1
hearing	1
something	1
which	1
overpowers	1
me.	1
You	1
sink	1
your	1
voice,	1
but	1
I	1
can	1
distinguish	1
the	1
tones	1
of	1
that	1
voice	1
when	1
they	1
would	1
be	1
lost	1
on	1
others.	1
Too	1
good,	1
too	1
excellent	1
creature!	1
You	1
do	1
us	1
justice,	1
indeed.	1
You	1
do	1
believe	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
true	1
attachment	1
and	1
constancy	1
among	1
men.	1
Believe	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
most	1
fervent,	1
most	1
undeviating,	1
in	1
F.	1
W.	1
"I	1
must	1
go,	1
uncertain	1
of	1
my	1
fate;	1
but	1
I	1
shall	1
return	1
hither,	1
or	1
follow	1
your	1
party,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
possible.	1
A	1
word,	1
a	1
look,	1
will	1
be	1
enough	1
to	1
decide	1
whether	1
I	1
enter	1
your	1
father's	1
house	1
this	1
evening	1
or	1
never."	1
Such	1
a	1
letter	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
soon	1
recovered	1
from.	1
Half	1
and	1
hour's	1
solitude	1
and	1
reflection	1
might	1
have	1
tranquillized	1
her;	1
but	1
the	1
ten	1
minutes	1
only	1
which	1
now	1
passed	1
before	1
she	1
was	1
interrupted,	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
restraints	1
of	1
her	1
situation,	1
could	1
do	1
nothing	1
towards	1
tranquillity.	1
Every	1
moment	1
rather	1
brought	1
fresh	1
agitation.	1
It	1
was	1
overpowering	1
happiness.	1
And	1
before	1
she	1
was	1
beyond	1
the	1
first	1
stage	1
of	1
full	1
sensation,	1
Charles,	1
Mary,	1
and	1
Henrietta	1
all	1
came	1
in.	1
The	1
absolute	1
necessity	1
of	1
seeming	1
like	1
herself	1
produced	1
then	1
an	1
immediate	1
struggle;	1
but	1
after	1
a	1
while	1
she	1
could	1
do	1
no	1
more.	1
She	1
began	1
not	1
to	1
understand	1
a	1
word	1
they	1
said,	1
and	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
plead	1
indisposition	1
and	1
excuse	1
herself.	1
They	1
could	1
then	1
see	1
that	1
she	1
looked	1
very	1
ill,	1
were	1
shocked	1
and	1
concerned,	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
stir	1
without	1
her	1
for	1
the	1
world.	1
This	1
was	1
dreadful.	1
Would	1
they	1
only	1
have	1
gone	1
away,	1
and	1
left	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
quiet	1
possession	1
of	1
that	1
room	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
her	1
cure;	1
but	1
to	1
have	1
them	1
all	1
standing	1
or	1
waiting	1
around	1
her	1
was	1
distracting,	1
and	1
in	1
desperation,	1
she	1
said	1
she	1
would	1
go	1
home.	1
"By	1
all	1
means,	1
my	1
dear,"	1
cried	1
Mrs	1
Musgrove,	1
"go	1
home	1
directly,	1
and	1
take	1
care	1
of	1
yourself,	1
that	1
you	1
may	1
be	1
fit	1
for	1
the	1
evening.	1
I	1
wish	1
Sarah	1
was	1
here	1
to	1
doctor	1
you,	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
no	1
doctor	1
myself.	1
Charles,	1
ring	1
and	1
order	1
a	1
chair.	1
She	1
must	1
not	1
walk."	1
But	1
the	1
chair	1
would	1
never	1
do.	1
Worse	1
than	1
all!	1
To	1
lose	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
speaking	1
two	1
words	1
to	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
her	1
quiet,	1
solitary	1
progress	1
up	1
the	1
town	1
(and	1
she	1
felt	1
almost	1
certain	1
of	1
meeting	1
him)	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
borne.	1
The	1
chair	1
was	1
earnestly	1
protested	1
against,	1
and	1
Mrs	1
Musgrove,	1
who	1
thought	1
only	1
of	1
one	1
sort	1
of	1
illness,	1
having	1
assured	1
herself	1
with	1
some	1
anxiety,	1
that	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
no	1
fall	1
in	1
the	1
case;	1
that	1
Anne	1
had	1
not	1
at	1
any	1
time	1
lately	1
slipped	1
down,	1
and	1
got	1
a	1
blow	1
on	1
her	1
head;	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
perfectly	1
convinced	1
of	1
having	1
had	1
no	1
fall;	1
could	1
part	1
with	1
her	1
cheerfully,	1
and	1
depend	1
on	1
finding	1
her	1
better	1
at	1
night.	1
Anxious	1
to	1
omit	1
no	1
possible	1
precaution,	1
Anne	1
struggled,	1
and	1
said--	1
"I	1
am	1
afraid,	1
ma'am,	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
perfectly	1
understood.	1
Pray	1
be	1
so	1
good	1
as	1
to	1
mention	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
gentlemen	1
that	1
we	1
hope	1
to	1
see	1
your	1
whole	1
party	1
this	1
evening.	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
some	1
mistake;	1
and	1
I	1
wish	1
you	1
particularly	1
to	1
assure	1
Captain	1
Harville	1
and	1
Captain	1
Wentworth,	1
that	1
we	1
hope	1
to	1
see	1
them	1
both."	1
"Oh!	1
my	1
dear,	1
it	1
is	1
quite	1
understood,	1
I	1
give	1
you	1
my	1
word.	1
Captain	1
Harville	1
has	1
no	1
thought	1
but	1
of	1
going."	1
"Do	1
you	1
think	1
so?	1
But	1
I	1
am	1
afraid;	1
and	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
so	1
very	1
sorry.	1
Will	1
you	1
promise	1
me	1
to	1
mention	1
it,	1
when	1
you	1
see	1
them	1
again?	1
You	1
will	1
see	1
them	1
both	1
this	1
morning,	1
I	1
dare	1
say.	1
Do	1
promise	1
me."	1
"To	1
be	1
sure	1
I	1
will,	1
if	1
you	1
wish	1
it.	1
Charles,	1
if	1
you	1
see	1
Captain	1
Harville	1
anywhere,	1
remember	1
to	1
give	1
Miss	1
Anne's	1
message.	1
But	1
indeed,	1
my	1
dear,	1
you	1
need	1
not	1
be	1
uneasy.	1
Captain	1
Harville	1
holds	1
himself	1
quite	1
engaged,	1
I'll	1
answer	1
for	1
it;	1
and	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
the	1
same,	1
I	1
dare	1
say."	1
Anne	1
could	1
do	1
no	1
more;	1
but	1
her	1
heart	1
prophesied	1
some	1
mischance	1
to	1
damp	1
the	1
perfection	1
of	1
her	1
felicity.	1
It	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
very	1
lasting,	1
however.	1
Even	1
if	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
come	1
to	1
Camden	1
Place	1
himself,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
in	1
her	1
power	1
to	1
send	1
an	1
intelligible	1
sentence	1
by	1
Captain	1
Harville.	1
Another	1
momentary	1
vexation	1
occurred.	1
Charles,	1
in	1
his	1
real	1
concern	1
and	1
good	1
nature,	1
would	1
go	1
home	1
with	1
her;	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
preventing	1
him.	1
This	1
was	1
almost	1
cruel.	1
But	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
long	1
ungrateful;	1
he	1
was	1
sacrificing	1
an	1
engagement	1
at	1
a	1
gunsmith's,	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
use	1
to	1
her;	1
and	1
she	1
set	1
off	1
with	1
him,	1
with	1
no	1
feeling	1
but	1
gratitude	1
apparent.	1
They	1
were	1
on	1
Union	1
Street,	1
when	1
a	1
quicker	1
step	1
behind,	1
a	1
something	1
of	1
familiar	1
sound,	1
gave	1
her	1
two	1
moments'	1
preparation	1
for	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
Captain	1
Wentworth.	1
He	1
joined	1
them;	1
but,	1
as	1
if	1
irresolute	1
whether	1
to	1
join	1
or	1
to	1
pass	1
on,	1
said	1
nothing,	1
only	1
looked.	1
Anne	1
could	1
command	1
herself	1
enough	1
to	1
receive	1
that	1
look,	1
and	1
not	1
repulsively.	1
The	1
cheeks	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
pale	1
now	1
glowed,	1
and	1
the	1
movements	1
which	1
had	1
hesitated	1
were	1
decided.	1
He	1
walked	1
by	1
her	1
side.	1
Presently,	1
struck	1
by	1
a	1
sudden	1
thought,	1
Charles	1
said--	1
"Captain	1
Wentworth,	1
which	1
way	1
are	1
you	1
going?	1
Only	1
to	1
Gay	1
Street,	1
or	1
farther	1
up	1
the	1
town?"	1
"I	1
hardly	1
know,"	1
replied	1
Captain	1
Wentworth,	1
surprised.	1
"Are	1
you	1
going	1
as	1
high	1
as	1
Belmont?	1
Are	1
you	1
going	1
near	1
Camden	1
Place?	1
Because,	1
if	1
you	1
are,	1
I	1
shall	1
have	1
no	1
scruple	1
in	1
asking	1
you	1
to	1
take	1
my	1
place,	1
and	1
give	1
Anne	1
your	1
arm	1
to	1
her	1
father's	1
door.	1
She	1
is	1
rather	1
done	1
for	1
this	1
morning,	1
and	1
must	1
not	1
go	1
so	1
far	1
without	1
help,	1
and	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
that	1
fellow's	1
in	1
the	1
Market	1
Place.	1
He	1
promised	1
me	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
a	1
capital	1
gun	1
he	1
is	1
just	1
going	1
to	1
send	1
off;	1
said	1
he	1
would	1
keep	1
it	1
unpacked	1
to	1
the	1
last	1
possible	1
moment,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
see	1
it;	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
turn	1
back	1
now,	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
chance.	1
By	1
his	1
description,	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
like	1
the	1
second	1
size	1
double-barrel	1
of	1
mine,	1
which	1
you	1
shot	1
with	1
one	1
day	1
round	1
Winthrop."	1
There	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
an	1
objection.	1
There	1
could	1
be	1
only	1
the	1
most	1
proper	1
alacrity,	1
a	1
most	1
obliging	1
compliance	1
for	1
public	1
view;	1
and	1
smiles	1
reined	1
in	1
and	1
spirits	1
dancing	1
in	1
private	1
rapture.	1
In	1
half	1
a	1
minute	1
Charles	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
Union	1
Street	1
again,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
two	1
proceeding	1
together:	1
and	1
soon	1
words	1
enough	1
had	1
passed	1
between	1
them	1
to	1
decide	1
their	1
direction	1
towards	1
the	1
comparatively	1
quiet	1
and	1
retired	1
gravel	1
walk,	1
where	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
conversation	1
would	1
make	1
the	1
present	1
hour	1
a	1
blessing	1
indeed,	1
and	1
prepare	1
it	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
immortality	1
which	1
the	1
happiest	1
recollections	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
future	1
lives	1
could	1
bestow.	1
There	1
they	1
exchanged	1
again	1
those	1
feelings	1
and	1
those	1
promises	1
which	1
had	1
once	1
before	1
seemed	1
to	1
secure	1
everything,	1
but	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
followed	1
by	1
so	1
many,	1
many	1
years	1
of	1
division	1
and	1
estrangement.	1
There	1
they	1
returned	1
again	1
into	1
the	1
past,	1
more	1
exquisitely	1
happy,	1
perhaps,	1
in	1
their	1
re-union,	1
than	1
when	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
first	1
projected;	1
more	1
tender,	1
more	1
tried,	1
more	1
fixed	1
in	1
a	1
knowledge	1
of	1
each	1
other's	1
character,	1
truth,	1
and	1
attachment;	1
more	1
equal	1
to	1
act,	1
more	1
justified	1
in	1
acting.	1
And	1
there,	1
as	1
they	1
slowly	1
paced	1
the	1
gradual	1
ascent,	1
heedless	1
of	1
every	1
group	1
around	1
them,	1
seeing	1
neither	1
sauntering	1
politicians,	1
bustling	1
housekeepers,	1
flirting	1
girls,	1
nor	1
nursery-maids	1
and	1
children,	1
they	1
could	1
indulge	1
in	1
those	1
retrospections	1
and	1
acknowledgements,	1
and	1
especially	1
in	1
those	1
explanations	1
of	1
what	1
had	1
directly	1
preceded	1
the	1
present	1
moment,	1
which	1
were	1
so	1
poignant	1
and	1
so	1
ceaseless	1
in	1
interest.	1
All	1
the	1
little	1
variations	1
of	1
the	1
last	1
week	1
were	1
gone	1
through;	1
and	1
of	1
yesterday	1
and	1
today	1
there	1
could	1
scarcely	1
be	1
an	1
end.	1
She	1
had	1
not	1
mistaken	1
him.	1
Jealousy	1
of	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
retarding	1
weight,	1
the	1
doubt,	1
the	1
torment.	1
That	1
had	1
begun	1
to	1
operate	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
hour	1
of	1
first	1
meeting	1
her	1
in	1
Bath;	1
that	1
had	1
returned,	1
after	1
a	1
short	1
suspension,	1
to	1
ruin	1
the	1
concert;	1
and	1
that	1
had	1
influenced	1
him	1
in	1
everything	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
and	1
done,	1
or	1
omitted	1
to	1
say	1
and	1
do,	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
four-and-twenty	1
hours.	1
It	1
had	1
been	1
gradually	1
yielding	1
to	1
the	1
better	1
hopes	1
which	1
her	1
looks,	1
or	1
words,	1
or	1
actions	1
occasionally	1
encouraged;	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
vanquished	1
at	1
last	1
by	1
those	1
sentiments	1
and	1
those	1
tones	1
which	1
had	1
reached	1
him	1
while	1
she	1
talked	1
with	1
Captain	1
Harville;	1
and	1
under	1
the	1
irresistible	1
governance	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
seized	1
a	1
sheet	1
of	1
paper,	1
and	1
poured	1
out	1
his	1
feelings.	1
Of	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
then	1
written,	1
nothing	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
retracted	1
or	1
qualified.	1
He	1
persisted	1
in	1
having	1
loved	1
none	1
but	1
her.	1
She	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
supplanted.	1
He	1
never	1
even	1
believed	1
himself	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
equal.	1
Thus	1
much	1
indeed	1
he	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
acknowledge:	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
constant	1
unconsciously,	1
nay	1
unintentionally;	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
meant	1
to	1
forget	1
her,	1
and	1
believed	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
done.	1
He	1
had	1
imagined	1
himself	1
indifferent,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
only	1
been	1
angry;	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
unjust	1
to	1
her	1
merits,	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
sufferer	1
from	1
them.	1
Her	1
character	1
was	1
now	1
fixed	1
on	1
his	1
mind	1
as	1
perfection	1
itself,	1
maintaining	1
the	1
loveliest	1
medium	1
of	1
fortitude	1
and	1
gentleness;	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
acknowledge	1
that	1
only	1
at	1
Uppercross	1
had	1
he	1
learnt	1
to	1
do	1
her	1
justice,	1
and	1
only	1
at	1
Lyme	1
had	1
he	1
begun	1
to	1
understand	1
himself.	1
At	1
Lyme,	1
he	1
had	1
received	1
lessons	1
of	1
more	1
than	1
one	1
sort.	1
The	1
passing	1
admiration	1
of	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
had	1
at	1
least	1
roused	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
scenes	1
on	1
the	1
Cobb	1
and	1
at	1
Captain	1
Harville's	1
had	1
fixed	1
her	1
superiority.	1
In	1
his	1
preceding	1
attempts	1
to	1
attach	1
himself	1
to	1
Louisa	1
Musgrove	1
(the	1
attempts	1
of	1
angry	1
pride),	1
he	1
protested	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
for	1
ever	1
felt	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
impossible;	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
cared,	1
could	1
not	1
care,	1
for	1
Louisa;	1
though	1
till	1
that	1
day,	1
till	1
the	1
leisure	1
for	1
reflection	1
which	1
followed	1
it,	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
understood	1
the	1
perfect	1
excellence	1
of	1
the	1
mind	1
with	1
which	1
Louisa's	1
could	1
so	1
ill	1
bear	1
a	1
comparison,	1
or	1
the	1
perfect	1
unrivalled	1
hold	1
it	1
possessed	1
over	1
his	1
own.	1
There,	1
he	1
had	1
learnt	1
to	1
distinguish	1
between	1
the	1
steadiness	1
of	1
principle	1
and	1
the	1
obstinacy	1
of	1
self-will,	1
between	1
the	1
darings	1
of	1
heedlessness	1
and	1
the	1
resolution	1
of	1
a	1
collected	1
mind.	1
There	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
everything	1
to	1
exalt	1
in	1
his	1
estimation	1
the	1
woman	1
he	1
had	1
lost;	1
and	1
there	1
begun	1
to	1
deplore	1
the	1
pride,	1
the	1
folly,	1
the	1
madness	1
of	1
resentment,	1
which	1
had	1
kept	1
him	1
from	1
trying	1
to	1
regain	1
her	1
when	1
thrown	1
in	1
his	1
way.	1
From	1
that	1
period	1
his	1
penance	1
had	1
become	1
severe.	1
He	1
had	1
no	1
sooner	1
been	1
free	1
from	1
the	1
horror	1
and	1
remorse	1
attending	1
the	1
first	1
few	1
days	1
of	1
Louisa's	1
accident,	1
no	1
sooner	1
begun	1
to	1
feel	1
himself	1
alive	1
again,	1
than	1
he	1
had	1
begun	1
to	1
feel	1
himself,	1
though	1
alive,	1
not	1
at	1
liberty.	1
"I	1
found,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"that	1
I	1
was	1
considered	1
by	1
Harville	1
an	1
engaged	1
man!	1
That	1
neither	1
Harville	1
nor	1
his	1
wife	1
entertained	1
a	1
doubt	1
of	1
our	1
mutual	1
attachment.	1
I	1
was	1
startled	1
and	1
shocked.	1
To	1
a	1
degree,	1
I	1
could	1
contradict	1
this	1
instantly;	1
but,	1
when	1
I	1
began	1
to	1
reflect	1
that	1
others	1
might	1
have	1
felt	1
the	1
same--her	1
own	1
family,	1
nay,	1
perhaps	1
herself--I	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
at	1
my	1
own	1
disposal.	1
I	1
was	1
hers	1
in	1
honour	1
if	1
she	1
wished	1
it.	1
I	1
had	1
been	1
unguarded.	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
thought	1
seriously	1
on	1
this	1
subject	1
before.	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
considered	1
that	1
my	1
excessive	1
intimacy	1
must	1
have	1
its	1
danger	1
of	1
ill	1
consequence	1
in	1
many	1
ways;	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
right	1
to	1
be	1
trying	1
whether	1
I	1
could	1
attach	1
myself	1
to	1
either	1
of	1
the	1
girls,	1
at	1
the	1
risk	1
of	1
raising	1
even	1
an	1
unpleasant	1
report,	1
were	1
there	1
no	1
other	1
ill	1
effects.	1
I	1
had	1
been	1
grossly	1
wrong,	1
and	1
must	1
abide	1
the	1
consequences."	1
He	1
found	1
too	1
late,	1
in	1
short,	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
entangled	1
himself;	1
and	1
that	1
precisely	1
as	1
he	1
became	1
fully	1
satisfied	1
of	1
his	1
not	1
caring	1
for	1
Louisa	1
at	1
all,	1
he	1
must	1
regard	1
himself	1
as	1
bound	1
to	1
her,	1
if	1
her	1
sentiments	1
for	1
him	1
were	1
what	1
the	1
Harvilles	1
supposed.	1
It	1
determined	1
him	1
to	1
leave	1
Lyme,	1
and	1
await	1
her	1
complete	1
recovery	1
elsewhere.	1
He	1
would	1
gladly	1
weaken,	1
by	1
any	1
fair	1
means,	1
whatever	1
feelings	1
or	1
speculations	1
concerning	1
him	1
might	1
exist;	1
and	1
he	1
went,	1
therefore,	1
to	1
his	1
brother's,	1
meaning	1
after	1
a	1
while	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
Kellynch,	1
and	1
act	1
as	1
circumstances	1
might	1
require.	1
"I	1
was	1
six	1
weeks	1
with	1
Edward,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"and	1
saw	1
him	1
happy.	1
I	1
could	1
have	1
no	1
other	1
pleasure.	1
I	1
deserved	1
none.	1
He	1
enquired	1
after	1
you	1
very	1
particularly;	1
asked	1
even	1
if	1
you	1
were	1
personally	1
altered,	1
little	1
suspecting	1
that	1
to	1
my	1
eye	1
you	1
could	1
never	1
alter."	1
Anne	1
smiled,	1
and	1
let	1
it	1
pass.	1
It	1
was	1
too	1
pleasing	1
a	1
blunder	1
for	1
a	1
reproach.	1
It	1
is	1
something	1
for	1
a	1
woman	1
to	1
be	1
assured,	1
in	1
her	1
eight-and-twentieth	1
year,	1
that	1
she	1
has	1
not	1
lost	1
one	1
charm	1
of	1
earlier	1
youth;	1
but	1
the	1
value	1
of	1
such	1
homage	1
was	1
inexpressibly	1
increased	1
to	1
Anne,	1
by	1
comparing	1
it	1
with	1
former	1
words,	1
and	1
feeling	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
result,	1
not	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
a	1
revival	1
of	1
his	1
warm	1
attachment.	1
He	1
had	1
remained	1
in	1
Shropshire,	1
lamenting	1
the	1
blindness	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
pride,	1
and	1
the	1
blunders	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
calculations,	1
till	1
at	1
once	1
released	1
from	1
Louisa	1
by	1
the	1
astonishing	1
and	1
felicitous	1
intelligence	1
of	1
her	1
engagement	1
with	1
Benwick.	1
"Here,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"ended	1
the	1
worst	1
of	1
my	1
state;	1
for	1
now	1
I	1
could	1
at	1
least	1
put	1
myself	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
happiness;	1
I	1
could	1
exert	1
myself;	1
I	1
could	1
do	1
something.	1
But	1
to	1
be	1
waiting	1
so	1
long	1
in	1
inaction,	1
and	1
waiting	1
only	1
for	1
evil,	1
had	1
been	1
dreadful.	1
Within	1
the	1
first	1
five	1
minutes	1
I	1
said,	1
`I	1
will	1
be	1
at	1
Bath	1
on	1
Wednesday,'	1
and	1
I	1
was.	1
Was	1
it	1
unpardonable	1
to	1
think	1
it	1
worth	1
my	1
while	1
to	1
come?	1
and	1
to	1
arrive	1
with	1
some	1
degree	1
of	1
hope?	1
You	1
were	1
single.	1
It	1
was	1
possible	1
that	1
you	1
might	1
retain	1
the	1
feelings	1
of	1
the	1
past,	1
as	1
I	1
did;	1
and	1
one	1
encouragement	1
happened	1
to	1
be	1
mine.	1
I	1
could	1
never	1
doubt	1
that	1
you	1
would	1
be	1
loved	1
and	1
sought	1
by	1
others,	1
but	1
I	1
knew	1
to	1
a	1
certainty	1
that	1
you	1
had	1
refused	1
one	1
man,	1
at	1
least,	1
of	1
better	1
pretensions	1
than	1
myself;	1
and	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
often	1
saying,	1
`Was	1
this	1
for	1
me?'"	1
Their	1
first	1
meeting	1
in	1
Milsom	1
Street	1
afforded	1
much	1
to	1
be	1
said,	1
but	1
the	1
concert	1
still	1
more.	1
That	1
evening	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
made	1
up	1
of	1
exquisite	1
moments.	1
The	1
moment	1
of	1
her	1
stepping	1
forward	1
in	1
the	1
Octagon	1
Room	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
him:	1
the	1
moment	1
of	1
Mr	1
Elliot's	1
appearing	1
and	1
tearing	1
her	1
away,	1
and	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
subsequent	1
moments,	1
marked	1
by	1
returning	1
hope	1
or	1
increasing	1
despondency,	1
were	1
dwelt	1
on	1
with	1
energy.	1
"To	1
see	1
you,"	1
cried	1
he,	1
"in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
my	1
well-wishers;	1
to	1
see	1
your	1
cousin	1
close	1
by	1
you,	1
conversing	1
and	1
smiling,	1
and	1
feel	1
all	1
the	1
horrible	1
eligibilities	1
and	1
proprieties	1
of	1
the	1
match!	1
To	1
consider	1
it	1
as	1
the	1
certain	1
wish	1
of	1
every	1
being	1
who	1
could	1
hope	1
to	1
influence	1
you!	1
Even	1
if	1
your	1
own	1
feelings	1
were	1
reluctant	1
or	1
indifferent,	1
to	1
consider	1
what	1
powerful	1
supports	1
would	1
be	1
his!	1
Was	1
it	1
not	1
enough	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
fool	1
of	1
me	1
which	1
I	1
appeared?	1
How	1
could	1
I	1
look	1
on	1
without	1
agony?	1
Was	1
not	1
the	1
very	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
friend	1
who	1
sat	1
behind	1
you,	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
recollection	1
of	1
what	1
had	1
been,	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
her	1
influence,	1
the	1
indelible,	1
immoveable	1
impression	1
of	1
what	1
persuasion	1
had	1
once	1
done--	1
was	1
it	1
not	1
all	1
against	1
me?"	1
"You	1
should	1
have	1
distinguished,"	1
replied	1
Anne.	1
"You	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
suspected	1
me	1
now;	1
the	1
case	1
is	1
so	1
different,	1
and	1
my	1
age	1
is	1
so	1
different.	1
If	1
I	1
was	1
wrong	1
in	1
yielding	1
to	1
persuasion	1
once,	1
remember	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
persuasion	1
exerted	1
on	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
safety,	1
not	1
of	1
risk.	1
When	1
I	1
yielded,	1
I	1
thought	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
duty,	1
but	1
no	1
duty	1
could	1
be	1
called	1
in	1
aid	1
here.	1
In	1
marrying	1
a	1
man	1
indifferent	1
to	1
me,	1
all	1
risk	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
incurred,	1
and	1
all	1
duty	1
violated."	1
"Perhaps	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
reasoned	1
thus,"	1
he	1
replied,	1
"but	1
I	1
could	1
not.	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
derive	1
benefit	1
from	1
the	1
late	1
knowledge	1
I	1
had	1
acquired	1
of	1
your	1
character.	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
bring	1
it	1
into	1
play;	1
it	1
was	1
overwhelmed,	1
buried,	1
lost	1
in	1
those	1
earlier	1
feelings	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
been	1
smarting	1
under	1
year	1
after	1
year.	1
I	1
could	1
think	1
of	1
you	1
only	1
as	1
one	1
who	1
had	1
yielded,	1
who	1
had	1
given	1
me	1
up,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
influenced	1
by	1
any	1
one	1
rather	1
than	1
by	1
me.	1
I	1
saw	1
you	1
with	1
the	1
very	1
person	1
who	1
had	1
guided	1
you	1
in	1
that	1
year	1
of	1
misery.	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
reason	1
to	1
believe	1
her	1
of	1
less	1
authority	1
now.	1
The	1
force	1
of	1
habit	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
added."	1
"I	1
should	1
have	1
thought,"	1
said	1
Anne,	1
"that	1
my	1
manner	1
to	1
yourself	1
might	1
have	1
spared	1
you	1
much	1
or	1
all	1
of	1
this."	1
"No,	1
no!	1
your	1
manner	1
might	1
be	1
only	1
the	1
ease	1
which	1
your	1
engagement	1
to	1
another	1
man	1
would	1
give.	1
I	1
left	1
you	1
in	1
this	1
belief;	1
and	1
yet,	1
I	1
was	1
determined	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
again.	1
My	1
spirits	1
rallied	1
with	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
I	1
felt	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
still	1
a	1
motive	1
for	1
remaining	1
here."	1
At	1
last	1
Anne	1
was	1
at	1
home	1
again,	1
and	1
happier	1
than	1
any	1
one	1
in	1
that	1
house	1
could	1
have	1
conceived.	1
All	1
the	1
surprise	1
and	1
suspense,	1
and	1
every	1
other	1
painful	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
morning	1
dissipated	1
by	1
this	1
conversation,	1
she	1
re-entered	1
the	1
house	1
so	1
happy	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
obliged	1
to	1
find	1
an	1
alloy	1
in	1
some	1
momentary	1
apprehensions	1
of	1
its	1
being	1
impossible	1
to	1
last.	1
An	1
interval	1
of	1
meditation,	1
serious	1
and	1
grateful,	1
was	1
the	1
best	1
corrective	1
of	1
everything	1
dangerous	1
in	1
such	1
high-wrought	1
felicity;	1
and	1
she	1
went	1
to	1
her	1
room,	1
and	1
grew	1
steadfast	1
and	1
fearless	1
in	1
the	1
thankfulness	1
of	1
her	1
enjoyment.	1
The	1
evening	1
came,	1
the	1
drawing-rooms	1
were	1
lighted	1
up,	1
the	1
company	1
assembled.	1
It	1
was	1
but	1
a	1
card	1
party,	1
it	1
was	1
but	1
a	1
mixture	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
never	1
met	1
before,	1
and	1
those	1
who	1
met	1
too	1
often;	1
a	1
commonplace	1
business,	1
too	1
numerous	1
for	1
intimacy,	1
too	1
small	1
for	1
variety;	1
but	1
Anne	1
had	1
never	1
found	1
an	1
evening	1
shorter.	1
Glowing	1
and	1
lovely	1
in	1
sensibility	1
and	1
happiness,	1
and	1
more	1
generally	1
admired	1
than	1
she	1
thought	1
about	1
or	1
cared	1
for,	1
she	1
had	1
cheerful	1
or	1
forbearing	1
feelings	1
for	1
every	1
creature	1
around	1
her.	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
was	1
there;	1
she	1
avoided,	1
but	1
she	1
could	1
pity	1
him.	1
The	1
Wallises,	1
she	1
had	1
amusement	1
in	1
understanding	1
them.	1
Lady	1
Dalrymple	1
and	1
Miss	1
Carteret--they	1
would	1
soon	1
be	1
innoxious	1
cousins	1
to	1
her.	1
She	1
cared	1
not	1
for	1
Mrs	1
Clay,	1
and	1
had	1
nothing	1
to	1
blush	1
for	1
in	1
the	1
public	1
manners	1
of	1
her	1
father	1
and	1
sister.	1
With	1
the	1
Musgroves,	1
there	1
was	1
the	1
happy	1
chat	1
of	1
perfect	1
ease;	1
with	1
Captain	1
Harville,	1
the	1
kind-hearted	1
intercourse	1
of	1
brother	1
and	1
sister;	1
with	1
Lady	1
Russell,	1
attempts	1
at	1
conversation,	1
which	1
a	1
delicious	1
consciousness	1
cut	1
short;	1
with	1
Admiral	1
and	1
Mrs	1
Croft,	1
everything	1
of	1
peculiar	1
cordiality	1
and	1
fervent	1
interest,	1
which	1
the	1
same	1
consciousness	1
sought	1
to	1
conceal;	1
and	1
with	1
Captain	1
Wentworth,	1
some	1
moments	1
of	1
communications	1
continually	1
occurring,	1
and	1
always	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
more,	1
and	1
always	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
his	1
being	1
there.	1
It	1
was	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
short	1
meetings,	1
each	1
apparently	1
occupied	1
in	1
admiring	1
a	1
fine	1
display	1
of	1
greenhouse	1
plants,	1
that	1
she	1
said--	1
"I	1
have	1
been	1
thinking	1
over	1
the	1
past,	1
and	1
trying	1
impartially	1
to	1
judge	1
of	1
the	1
right	1
and	1
wrong,	1
I	1
mean	1
with	1
regard	1
to	1
myself;	1
and	1
I	1
must	1
believe	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
right,	1
much	1
as	1
I	1
suffered	1
from	1
it,	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
perfectly	1
right	1
in	1
being	1
guided	1
by	1
the	1
friend	1
whom	1
you	1
will	1
love	1
better	1
than	1
you	1
do	1
now.	1
To	1
me,	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
a	1
parent.	1
Do	1
not	1
mistake	1
me,	1
however.	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
saying	1
that	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
err	1
in	1
her	1
advice.	1
It	1
was,	1
perhaps,	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
cases	1
in	1
which	1
advice	1
is	1
good	1
or	1
bad	1
only	1
as	1
the	1
event	1
decides;	1
and	1
for	1
myself,	1
I	1
certainly	1
never	1
should,	1
in	1
any	1
circumstance	1
of	1
tolerable	1
similarity,	1
give	1
such	1
advice.	1
But	1
I	1
mean,	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
right	1
in	1
submitting	1
to	1
her,	1
and	1
that	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
done	1
otherwise,	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
suffered	1
more	1
in	1
continuing	1
the	1
engagement	1
than	1
I	1
did	1
even	1
in	1
giving	1
it	1
up,	1
because	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
suffered	1
in	1
my	1
conscience.	1
I	1
have	1
now,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
such	1
a	1
sentiment	1
is	1
allowable	1
in	1
human	1
nature,	1
nothing	1
to	1
reproach	1
myself	1
with;	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
mistake	1
not,	1
a	1
strong	1
sense	1
of	1
duty	1
is	1
no	1
bad	1
part	1
of	1
a	1
woman's	1
portion."	1
He	1
looked	1
at	1
her,	1
looked	1
at	1
Lady	1
Russell,	1
and	1
looking	1
again	1
at	1
her,	1
replied,	1
as	1
if	1
in	1
cool	1
deliberation--	1
"Not	1
yet.	1
But	1
there	1
are	1
hopes	1
of	1
her	1
being	1
forgiven	1
in	1
time.	1
I	1
trust	1
to	1
being	1
in	1
charity	1
with	1
her	1
soon.	1
But	1
I	1
too	1
have	1
been	1
thinking	1
over	1
the	1
past,	1
and	1
a	1
question	1
has	1
suggested	1
itself,	1
whether	1
there	1
may	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
one	1
person	1
more	1
my	1
enemy	1
even	1
than	1
that	1
lady?	1
My	1
own	1
self.	1
Tell	1
me	1
if,	1
when	1
I	1
returned	1
to	1
England	1
in	1
the	1
year	1
eight,	1
with	1
a	1
few	1
thousand	1
pounds,	1
and	1
was	1
posted	1
into	1
the	1
Laconia,	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
then	1
written	1
to	1
you,	1
would	1
you	1
have	1
answered	1
my	1
letter?	1
Would	1
you,	1
in	1
short,	1
have	1
renewed	1
the	1
engagement	1
then?"	1
"Would	1
I!"	1
was	1
all	1
her	1
answer;	1
but	1
the	1
accent	1
was	1
decisive	1
enough.	1
"Good	1
God!"	1
he	1
cried,	1
"you	1
would!	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
that	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
of	1
it,	1
or	1
desire	1
it,	1
as	1
what	1
could	1
alone	1
crown	1
all	1
my	1
other	1
success;	1
but	1
I	1
was	1
proud,	1
too	1
proud	1
to	1
ask	1
again.	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
you.	1
I	1
shut	1
my	1
eyes,	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
understand	1
you,	1
or	1
do	1
you	1
justice.	1
This	1
is	1
a	1
recollection	1
which	1
ought	1
to	1
make	1
me	1
forgive	1
every	1
one	1
sooner	1
than	1
myself.	1
Six	1
years	1
of	1
separation	1
and	1
suffering	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
spared.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
pain,	1
too,	1
which	1
is	1
new	1
to	1
me.	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
used	1
to	1
the	1
gratification	1
of	1
believing	1
myself	1
to	1
earn	1
every	1
blessing	1
that	1
I	1
enjoyed.	1
I	1
have	1
valued	1
myself	1
on	1
honourable	1
toils	1
and	1
just	1
rewards.	1
Like	1
other	1
great	1
men	1
under	1
reverses,"	1
he	1
added,	1
with	1
a	1

Chapter	1
24	1
Who	1
can	1
be	1
in	1
doubt	1
of	1
what	1
followed?	1
When	1
any	1
two	1
young	1
people	1
take	1
it	1
into	1
their	1
heads	1
to	1
marry,	1
they	1
are	1
pretty	1
sure	1
by	1
perseverance	1
to	1
carry	1
their	1
point,	1
be	1
they	1
ever	1
so	1
poor,	1
or	1
ever	1
so	1
imprudent,	1
or	1
ever	1
so	1
little	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
necessary	1
to	1
each	1
other's	1
ultimate	1
comfort.	1
This	1
may	1
be	1
bad	1
morality	1
to	1
conclude	1
with,	1
but	1
I	1
believe	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
truth;	1
and	1
if	1
such	1
parties	1
succeed,	1
how	1
should	1
a	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
and	1
an	1
Anne	1
Elliot,	1
with	1
the	1
advantage	1
of	1
maturity	1
of	1
mind,	1
consciousness	1
of	1
right,	1
and	1
one	1
independent	1
fortune	1
between	1
them,	1
fail	1
of	1
bearing	1
down	1
every	1
opposition?	1
They	1
might	1
in	1
fact,	1
have	1
borne	1
down	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
more	1
than	1
they	1
met	1
with,	1
for	1
there	1
was	1
little	1
to	1
distress	1
them	1
beyond	1
the	1
want	1
of	1
graciousness	1
and	1
warmth.	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
made	1
no	1
objection,	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
did	1
nothing	1
worse	1
than	1
look	1
cold	1
and	1
unconcerned.	1
Captain	1
Wentworth,	1
with	1
five-and-twenty	1
thousand	1
pounds,	1
and	1
as	1
high	1
in	1
his	1
profession	1
as	1
merit	1
and	1
activity	1
could	1
place	1
him,	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
nobody.	1
He	1
was	1
now	1
esteemed	1
quite	1
worthy	1
to	1
address	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
a	1
foolish,	1
spendthrift	1
baronet,	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
had	1
principle	1
or	1
sense	1
enough	1
to	1
maintain	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
situation	1
in	1
which	1
Providence	1
had	1
placed	1
him,	1
and	1
who	1
could	1
give	1
his	1
daughter	1
at	1
present	1
but	1
a	1
small	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
share	1
of	1
ten	1
thousand	1
pounds	1
which	1
must	1
be	1
hers	1
hereafter.	1
Sir	1
Walter,	1
indeed,	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
affection	1
for	1
Anne,	1
and	1
no	1
vanity	1
flattered,	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
really	1
happy	1
on	1
the	1
occasion,	1
was	1
very	1
far	1
from	1
thinking	1
it	1
a	1
bad	1
match	1
for	1
her.	1
On	1
the	1
contrary,	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
more	1
of	1
Captain	1
Wentworth,	1
saw	1
him	1
repeatedly	1
by	1
daylight,	1
and	1
eyed	1
him	1
well,	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
much	1
struck	1
by	1
his	1
personal	1
claims,	1
and	1
felt	1
that	1
his	1
superiority	1
of	1
appearance	1
might	1
be	1
not	1
unfairly	1
balanced	1
against	1
her	1
superiority	1
of	1
rank;	1
and	1
all	1
this,	1
assisted	1
by	1
his	1
well-sounding	1
name,	1
enabled	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
at	1
last	1
to	1
prepare	1
his	1
pen,	1
with	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
grace,	1
for	1
the	1
insertion	1
of	1
the	1
marriage	1
in	1
the	1
volume	1
of	1
honour.	1
The	1
only	1
one	1
among	1
them,	1
whose	1
opposition	1
of	1
feeling	1
could	1
excite	1
any	1
serious	1
anxiety	1
was	1
Lady	1
Russell.	1
Anne	1
knew	1
that	1
Lady	1
Russell	1
must	1
be	1
suffering	1
some	1
pain	1
in	1
understanding	1
and	1
relinquishing	1
Mr	1
Elliot,	1
and	1
be	1
making	1
some	1
struggles	1
to	1
become	1
truly	1
acquainted	1
with,	1
and	1
do	1
justice	1
to	1
Captain	1
Wentworth.	1
This	1
however	1
was	1
what	1
Lady	1
Russell	1
had	1
now	1
to	1
do.	1
She	1
must	1
learn	1
to	1
feel	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
mistaken	1
with	1
regard	1
to	1
both;	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
unfairly	1
influenced	1
by	1
appearances	1
in	1
each;	1
that	1
because	1
Captain	1
Wentworth's	1
manners	1
had	1
not	1
suited	1
her	1
own	1
ideas,	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
too	1
quick	1
in	1
suspecting	1
them	1
to	1
indicate	1
a	1
character	1
of	1
dangerous	1
impetuosity;	1
and	1
that	1
because	1
Mr	1
Elliot's	1
manners	1
had	1
precisely	1
pleased	1
her	1
in	1
their	1
propriety	1
and	1
correctness,	1
their	1
general	1
politeness	1
and	1
suavity,	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
too	1
quick	1
in	1
receiving	1
them	1
as	1
the	1
certain	1
result	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
correct	1
opinions	1
and	1
well-regulated	1
mind.	1
There	1
was	1
nothing	1
less	1
for	1
Lady	1
Russell	1
to	1
do,	1
than	1
to	1
admit	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
pretty	1
completely	1
wrong,	1
and	1
to	1
take	1
up	1
a	1
new	1
set	1
of	1
opinions	1
and	1
of	1
hopes.	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
quickness	1
of	1
perception	1
in	1
some,	1
a	1
nicety	1
in	1
the	1
discernment	1
of	1
character,	1
a	1
natural	1
penetration,	1
in	1
short,	1
which	1
no	1
experience	1
in	1
others	1
can	1
equal,	1
and	1
Lady	1
Russell	1
had	1
been	1
less	1
gifted	1
in	1
this	1
part	1
of	1
understanding	1
than	1
her	1
young	1
friend.	1
But	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
woman,	1
and	1
if	1
her	1
second	1
object	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
sensible	1
and	1
well-judging,	1
her	1
first	1
was	1
to	1
see	1
Anne	1
happy.	1
She	1
loved	1
Anne	1
better	1
than	1
she	1
loved	1
her	1
own	1
abilities;	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
awkwardness	1
of	1
the	1
beginning	1
was	1
over,	1
found	1
little	1
hardship	1
in	1
attaching	1
herself	1
as	1
a	1
mother	1
to	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
was	1
securing	1
the	1
happiness	1
of	1
her	1
other	1
child.	1
Of	1
all	1
the	1
family,	1
Mary	1
was	1
probably	1
the	1
one	1
most	1
immediately	1
gratified	1
by	1
the	1
circumstance.	1
It	1
was	1
creditable	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
sister	1
married,	1
and	1
she	1
might	1
flatter	1
herself	1
with	1
having	1
been	1
greatly	1
instrumental	1
to	1
the	1
connexion,	1
by	1
keeping	1
Anne	1
with	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
autumn;	1
and	1
as	1
her	1
own	1
sister	1
must	1
be	1
better	1
than	1
her	1
husband's	1
sisters,	1
it	1
was	1
very	1
agreeable	1
that	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
should	1
be	1
a	1
richer	1
man	1
than	1
either	1
Captain	1
Benwick	1
or	1
Charles	1
Hayter.	1
She	1
had	1
something	1
to	1
suffer,	1
perhaps,	1
when	1
they	1
came	1
into	1
contact	1
again,	1
in	1
seeing	1
Anne	1
restored	1
to	1
the	1
rights	1
of	1
seniority,	1
and	1
the	1
mistress	1
of	1
a	1
very	1
pretty	1
landaulette;	1
but	1
she	1
had	1
a	1
future	1
to	1
look	1
forward	1
to,	1
of	1
powerful	1
consolation.	1
Anne	1
had	1
no	1
Uppercross	1
Hall	1
before	1
her,	1
no	1
landed	1
estate,	1
no	1
headship	1
of	1
a	1
family;	1
and	1
if	1
they	1
could	1
but	1
keep	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
from	1
being	1
made	1
a	1
baronet,	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
change	1
situations	1
with	1
Anne.	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
well	1
for	1
the	1
eldest	1
sister	1
if	1
she	1
were	1
equally	1
satisfied	1
with	1
her	1
situation,	1
for	1
a	1
change	1
is	1
not	1
very	1
probable	1
there.	1
She	1
had	1
soon	1
the	1
mortification	1
of	1
seeing	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
withdraw,	1
and	1
no	1
one	1
of	1
proper	1
condition	1
has	1
since	1
presented	1
himself	1
to	1
raise	1
even	1
the	1
unfounded	1
hopes	1
which	1
sunk	1
with	1
him.	1
The	1
news	1
of	1
his	1
cousins	1
Anne's	1
engagement	1
burst	1
on	1
Mr	1
Elliot	1
most	1
unexpectedly.	1
It	1
deranged	1
his	1
best	1
plan	1
of	1
domestic	1
happiness,	1
his	1
best	1
hope	1
of	1
keeping	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
single	1
by	1
the	1
watchfulness	1
which	1
a	1
son-in-law's	1
rights	1
would	1
have	1
given.	1
But,	1
though	1
discomfited	1
and	1
disappointed,	1
he	1
could	1
still	1
do	1
something	1
for	1
his	1
own	1
interest	1
and	1
his	1
own	1
enjoyment.	1
He	1
soon	1
quitted	1
Bath;	1
and	1
on	1
Mrs	1
Clay's	1
quitting	1
it	1
soon	1
afterwards,	1
and	1
being	1
next	1
heard	1
of	1
as	1
established	1
under	1
his	1
protection	1
in	1
London,	1
it	1
was	1
evident	1
how	1
double	1
a	1
game	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
playing,	1
and	1
how	1
determined	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
save	1
himself	1
from	1
being	1
cut	1
out	1
by	1
one	1
artful	1
woman,	1
at	1
least.	1
Mrs	1
Clay's	1
affections	1
had	1
overpowered	1
her	1
interest,	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
sacrificed,	1
for	1
the	1
young	1
man's	1
sake,	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
scheming	1
longer	1
for	1
Sir	1
Walter.	1
She	1
has	1
abilities,	1
however,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
affections;	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
now	1
a	1
doubtful	1
point	1
whether	1
his	1
cunning,	1
or	1
hers,	1
may	1
finally	1
carry	1
the	1
day;	1
whether,	1
after	1
preventing	1
her	1
from	1
being	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
Sir	1
Walter,	1
he	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
wheedled	1
and	1
caressed	1
at	1
last	1
into	1
making	1
her	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
Sir	1
William.	1
It	1
cannot	1
be	1
doubted	1
that	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
were	1
shocked	1
and	1
mortified	1
by	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
their	1
companion,	1
and	1
the	1
discovery	1
of	1
their	1
deception	1
in	1
her.	1
They	1
had	1
their	1
great	1
cousins,	1
to	1
be	1
sure,	1
to	1
resort	1
to	1
for	1
comfort;	1
but	1
they	1
must	1
long	1
feel	1
that	1
to	1
flatter	1
and	1
follow	1
others,	1
without	1
being	1
flattered	1
and	1
followed	1
in	1
turn,	1
is	1
but	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
half	1
enjoyment.	1
Anne,	1
satisfied	1
at	1
a	1
very	1
early	1
period	1
of	1
Lady	1
Russell's	1
meaning	1
to	1
love	1
Captain	1
Wentworth	1
as	1
she	1
ought,	1
had	1
no	1
other	1
alloy	1
to	1
the	1
happiness	1
of	1
her	1
prospects	1
than	1
what	1
arose	1
from	1
the	1
consciousness	1
of	1
having	1
no	1
relations	1
to	1
bestow	1
on	1
him	1
which	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
sense	1
could	1
value.	1
There	1
she	1
felt	1
her	1
own	1
inferiority	1
very	1
keenly.	1
The	1
disproportion	1
in	1
their	1
fortune	1
was	1
nothing;	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
give	1
her	1
a	1
moment's	1
regret;	1
but	1
to	1
have	1
no	1
family	1
to	1
receive	1
and	1
estimate	1
him	1
properly,	1
nothing	1
of	1
respectability,	1
of	1
harmony,	1
of	1
good	1
will	1
to	1
offer	1
in	1
return	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
worth	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
prompt	1
welcome	1
which	1
met	1
her	1
in	1
his	1
brothers	1
and	1
sisters,	1
was	1
a	1
source	1
of	1
as	1
lively	1
pain	1
as	1
her	1
mind	1
could	1
well	1
be	1
sensible	1
of	1
under	1
circumstances	1
of	1
otherwise	1
strong	1
felicity.	1
She	1
had	1
but	1
two	1
friends	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
add	1
to	1
his	1
list,	1
Lady	1
Russell	1
and	1
Mrs	1
Smith.	1
To	1
those,	1
however,	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
well	1
disposed	1
to	1
attach	1
himself.	1
Lady	1
Russell,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
her	1
former	1
transgressions,	1
he	1
could	1
now	1
value	1
from	1
his	1
heart.	1
While	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
obliged	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
he	1
believed	1
her	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
right	1
in	1
originally	1
dividing	1
them,	1
he	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
say	1
almost	1
everything	1
else	1
in	1
her	1
favour,	1
and	1
as	1
for	1
Mrs	1
Smith,	1
she	1
had	1
claims	1
of	1
various	1
kinds	1
to	1
recommend	1
her	1
quickly	1
and	1
permanently.	1
Her	1
recent	1
good	1
offices	1
by	1
Anne	1
had	1
been	1
enough	1
in	1
themselves,	1
and	1
their	1
marriage,	1
instead	1
of	1
depriving	1
her	1
of	1
one	1
friend,	1
secured	1
her	1
two.	1
She	1
was	1
their	1
earliest	1
visitor	1
in	1
their	1
settled	1
life;	1
and	1
Captain	1
Wentworth,	1
by	1
putting	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
recovering	1
her	1
husband's	1
property	1
in	1
the	1
West	1
Indies,	1
by	1
writing	1
for	1
her,	1
acting	1
for	1
her,	1
and	1
seeing	1
her	1
through	1
all	1
the	1
petty	1
difficulties	1
of	1
the	1
case	1
with	1
the	1
activity	1
and	1
exertion	1
of	1
a	1
fearless	1
man	1
and	1
a	1
determined	1
friend,	1
fully	1
requited	1
the	1
services	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
rendered,	1
or	1
ever	1
meant	1
to	1
render,	1
to	1
his	1
wife.	1
Mrs	1
Smith's	1
enjoyments	1
were	1
not	1
spoiled	1
by	1
this	1
improvement	1
of	1
income,	1
with	1
some	1
improvement	1
of	1
health,	1
and	1
the	1
acquisition	1
of	1
such	1
friends	1
to	1
be	1
often	1
with,	1
for	1
her	1
cheerfulness	1
and	1
mental	1
alacrity	1
did	1
not	1
fail	1
her;	1
and	1
while	1
these	1
prime	1
supplies	1
of	1
good	1
remained,	1
she	1
might	1
have	1
bid	1
defiance	1
even	1
to	1
greater	1
accessions	1
of	1
worldly	1
prosperity.	1
She	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
absolutely	1
rich	1
and	1
perfectly	1
healthy,	1
and	1
yet	1
be	1
happy.	1
Her	1
spring	1
of	1
felicity	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
glow	1
of	1
her	1
spirits,	1
as	1
her	1
friend	1
Anne's	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
warmth	1
of	1
her	1
heart.	1
Anne	1
was	1
tenderness	1
itself,	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
the	1
full	1
worth	1
of	1
it	1
in	1
Captain	1
Wentworth's	1
affection.	1
His	1
profession	1
was	1
all	1
that	1
could	1
ever	1
make	1
her	1
friends	1
wish	1
that	1
tenderness	1
less,	1
the	1
dread	1
of	1
a	1
future	1
war	1
all	1
that	1
could	1
dim	1
her	1
sunshine.	1
She	1
gloried	1
in	1
being	1
a	1
sailor's	1
wife,	1
but	1
she	1
must	1
pay	1
the	1
tax	1
of	1
quick	1
alarm	1
for	1
belonging	1
