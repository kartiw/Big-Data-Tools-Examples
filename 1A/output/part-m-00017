SONGS	1
OF	1
INNOCENCE	1
INTRODUCTION	1
Piping	1
down	1
the	1
valleys	1
wild,	1
Piping	1
songs	1
of	1
pleasant	1
glee,	1
On	1
a	1
cloud	1
I	1
saw	1
a	1
child,	1
And	1
he	1
laughing	1
said	1
to	1
me:	1
"Pipe	1
a	1
song	1
about	1
a	1
Lamb!"	1
So	1
I	1
piped	1
with	1
merry	1
cheer.	1
"Piper,	1
pipe	1
that	1
song	1
again;"	1
So	1
I	1
piped:	1
he	1
wept	1
to	1
hear.	1
"Drop	1
thy	1
pipe,	1
thy	1
happy	1
pipe;	1
Sing	1
thy	1
songs	1
of	1
happy	1
cheer:!"	1
So	1
I	1
sang	1
the	1
same	1
again,	1
While	1
he	1
wept	1
with	1
joy	1
to	1
hear.	1
"Piper,	1
sit	1
thee	1
down	1
and	1
write	1
In	1
a	1
book,	1
that	1
all	1
may	1
read."	1
So	1
he	1
vanish'd	1
from	1
my	1
sight;	1
And	1
I	1
pluck'd	1
a	1
hollow	1
reed,	1
And	1
I	1
made	1
a	1
rural	1
pen,	1
And	1
I	1
stain'd	1
the	1
water	1
clear,	1
And	1
I	1
wrote	1
my	1
happy	1
songs	1
Every	1
child	1
may	1
joy	1
to	1
hear.	1
THE	1
SHEPHERD	1
How	1
sweet	1
is	1
the	1
Shepherd's	1
sweet	1
lot!	1
From	1
the	1
morn	1
to	1
the	1
evening	1
he	1
stays;	1
He	1
shall	1
follow	1
his	1
sheep	1
all	1
the	1
day,	1
And	1
his	1
tongue	1
shall	1
be	1
filled	1
with	1
praise.	1
For	1
he	1
hears	1
the	1
lambs'	1
innocent	1
call,	1
And	1
he	1
hears	1
the	1
ewes'	1
tender	1
reply;	1
He	1
is	1
watching	1
while	1
they	1
are	1
in	1
peace,	1
For	1
they	1
know	1
when	1
their	1
Shepherd	1
is	1
nigh.	1
THE	1
ECHOING	1
GREEN	1
The	1
sun	1
does	1
arise,	1
And	1
make	1
happy	1
the	1
skies;	1
The	1
merry	1
bells	1
ring	1
To	1
welcome	1
the	1
Spring;	1
The	1
skylark	1
and	1
thrush,	1
The	1
birds	1
of	1
the	1
bush,	1
Sing	1
louder	1
around	1
To	1
the	1
bells'	1
cheerful	1
sound;	1
While	1
our	1
sports	1
shall	1
be	1
seen	1
On	1
the	1
echoing	1
Green.	1
Old	1
John,	1
with	1
white	1
hair,	1
Does	1
laugh	1
away	1
care,	1
Sitting	1
under	1
the	1
oak,	1
Among	1
the	1
old	1
folk.	1
They	1
laugh	1
at	1
our	1
play,	1
And	1
soon	1
they	1
all	1
say,	1
"Such,	1
such	1
were	1
the	1
joys	1
When	1
we	1
all	1
--	1
girls	1
and	1
boys	1
--	1
In	1
our	1
youth-time	1
were	1
seen	1
On	1
the	1
echoing	1
Green."	1
Till	1
the	1
little	1
ones,	1
weary,	1
No	1
more	1
can	1
be	1
merry:	1
The	1
sun	1
does	1
descend,	1
And	1
our	1
sports	1
have	1
an	1
end.	1
Round	1
the	1
laps	1
of	1
their	1
mothers	1
Many	1
sisters	1
and	1
brothers,	1
Like	1
birds	1
in	1
their	1
nest,	1
Are	1
ready	1
for	1
rest,	1
And	1
sport	1
no	1
more	1
seen	1
On	1
the	1
darkening	1
green.	1
THE	1
LAMB	1
Little	1
Lamb,	1
who	1
make	1
thee	1
Dost	1
thou	1
know	1
who	1
made	1
thee,	1
Gave	1
thee	1
life,	1
and	1
bid	1
thee	1
feed	1
By	1
the	1
stream	1
and	1
o'er	1
the	1
mead;	1
Gave	1
thee	1
clothing	1
of	1
delight,	1
Softest	1
clothing,	1
wolly,	1
bright;	1
Gave	1
thee	1
such	1
a	1
tender	1
voice,	1
Making	1
all	1
the	1
vales	1
rejoice?	1
Little	1
Lamb,	1
who	1
made	1
thee?	1
Dost	1
thou	1
know	1
who	1
made	1
thee?	1
Little	1
Lamb,	1
I'll	1
tell	1
thee;	1
Little	1
Lamb,	1
I'll	1
tell	1
thee:	1
He	1
is	1
called	1
by	1
thy	1
name,	1
For	1
He	1
calls	1
Himself	1
a	1
Lamb	1
He	1
is	1
meek,	1
and	1
He	1
is	1
mild,	1
He	1
became	1
a	1
little	1
child.	1
I	1
a	1
child,	1
and	1
thou	1
a	1
lamb,	1
We	1
are	1
called	1
by	1
His	1
name.	1
Little	1
Lamb,	1
God	1
bless	1
thee!	1
Little	1
Lamb,	1
God	1
bless	1
thee!	1
THE	1
LITTLE	1
BLACK	1
BOY	1
My	1
mother	1
bore	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
southern	1
wild,	1
And	1
I	1
am	1
black,	1
but	1
oh	1
my	1
soul	1
is	1
white!	1
White	1
as	1
an	1
angel	1
is	1
the	1
English	1
child,	1
But	1
I	1
am	1
black,	1
as	1
if	1
bereaved	1
of	1
light.	1
My	1
mother	1
taught	1
me	1
underneath	1
a	1
tree,	1
And,	1
sitting	1
down	1
before	1
the	1
heat	1
of	1
day,	1
She	1
took	1
me	1
on	1
her	1
lap	1
and	1
kissed	1
me,	1
And,	1
pointed	1
to	1
the	1
east,	1
began	1
to	1
say:	1
"Look	1
on	1
the	1
rising	1
sun:	1
there	1
God	1
does	1
live,	1
And	1
gives	1
His	1
light,	1
and	1
gives	1
His	1
heat	1
away,	1
And	1
flowers	1
and	1
trees	1
and	1
beasts	1
and	1
men	1
receive	1
Comfort	1
in	1
morning,	1
joy	1
in	1
the	1
noonday.	1
"And	1
we	1
are	1
put	1
on	1
earth	1
a	1
little	1
space,	1
That	1
we	1
may	1
learn	1
to	1
bear	1
the	1
beams	1
of	1
love	1
And	1
these	1
black	1
bodies	1
and	1
this	1
sunburnt	1
face	1
Is	1
but	1
a	1
cloud,	1
and	1
like	1
a	1
shady	1
grove.	1
"For	1
when	1
our	1
souls	1
have	1
learn'd	1
the	1
heat	1
to	1
bear,	1
The	1
cloud	1
will	1
vanish,	1
we	1
shall	1
hear	1
His	1
voice,	1
Saying,	1
'Come	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
grove,	1
my	1
love	1
and	1
care	1
And	1
round	1
my	1
golden	1
tent	1
like	1
lambs	1
rejoice',"	1
Thus	1
did	1
my	1
mother	1
say,	1
and	1
kissed	1
me;	1
And	1
thus	1
I	1
say	1
to	1
little	1
English	1
boy.	1
When	1
I	1
from	1
black	1
and	1
he	1
from	1
white	1
cloud	1
free,	1
And	1
round	1
the	1
tent	1
of	1
God	1
like	1
lambs	1
we	1
joy	1
I'll	1
shade	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
heat	1
till	1
he	1
can	1
bear	1
To	1
lean	1
in	1
joy	1
upon	1
our	1
Father's	1
knee;	1
And	1
then	1
I'll	1
stand	1
and	1
stroke	1
his	1
silver	1
hair,	1
And	1
be	1
like	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
then	1
love	1
me.	1
THE	1
BLOSSOM	1
Merry,	1
merry	1
sparrow!	1
Under	1
leaves	1
so	1
green	1
A	1
happy	1
blossom	1
Sees	1
you,	1
swift	1
as	1
arrow,	1
Seek	1
your	1
cradle	1
narrow,	1
Near	1
my	1
bosom.	1
Pretty,	1
pretty	1
robin!	1
Under	1
leaves	1
so	1
green	1
A	1
happy	1
blossom	1
Hears	1
you	1
sobbing,	1
sobbing,	1
Pretty,	1
pretty	1
robin,	1
Near	1
my	1
bosom.	1
THE	1
CHIMNEY-SWEEPER	1
When	1
my	1
mother	1
died	1
I	1
was	1
very	1
young,	1
And	1
my	1
father	1
sold	1
me	1
while	1
yet	1
my	1
tongue	1
Could	1
scarcely	1
cry	1
"Weep!	1
weep!	1
weep!	1
weep!"	1
So	1
your	1
chimneys	1
I	1
sweep,	1
and	1
in	1
soot	1
I	1
sleep.	1
There's	1
little	1
Tom	1
Dacre,	1
who	1
cried	1
when	1
his	1
head,	1
That	1
curled	1
like	1
a	1
lamb's	1
back,	1
was	1
shaved;	1
so	1
I	1
said,	1
"Hush,	1
Tom!	1
never	1
mind	1
it,	1
for,	1
when	1
your	1
head's	1
bare,	1
You	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
soot	1
cannot	1
spoil	1
your	1
white	1
hair."	1
And	1
so	1
he	1
was	1
quiet,	1
and	1
that	1
very	1
night,	1
As	1
Tom	1
was	1
a-sleeping,	1
he	1
had	1
such	1
a	1
sight!	1
--	1
That	1
thousands	1
of	1
sweepers,	1
Dick,	1
Joe,	1
Ned,	1
and	1
Jack,	1
Were	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
locked	1
up	1
in	1
coffins	1
of	1
black.	1
And	1
by	1
came	1
an	1
angel,	1
who	1
had	1
a	1
bright	1
key,	1
And	1
he	1
opened	1
the	1
coffins,	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
all	1
free;	1
Then	1
down	1
a	1
green	1
plain,	1
leaping,	1
laughing,	1
they	1
run,	1
And	1
wash	1
in	1
a	1
river,	1
and	1
shine	1
in	1
the	1
sun.	1
Then	1
naked	1
and	1
white,	1
all	1
their	1
bags	1
left	1
behind,	1
They	1
rise	1
upon	1
clouds,	1
and	1
sport	1
in	1
the	1
wind;	1
And	1
the	1
Angel	1
told	1
Tom,	1
if	1
he'd	1
be	1
a	1
good	1
boy,	1
He'd	1
have	1
God	1
for	1
his	1
father,	1
and	1
never	1
want	1
joy.	1
And	1
so	1
Tom	1
awoke,	1
and	1
we	1
rose	1
in	1
the	1
dark,	1
And	1
got	1
with	1
our	1
bags	1
and	1
our	1
brushes	1
to	1
work.	1
Though	1
the	1
morning	1
was	1
cold,	1
Tom	1
was	1
happy	1
and	1
warm:	1
So,	1
if	1
all	1
do	1
their	1
duty,	1
they	1
need	1
not	1
fear	1
harm.	1
THE	1
LITTLE	1
BOY	1
LOST	1
"Father,	1
father,	1
where	1
are	1
you	1
going?	1
Oh	1
do	1
not	1
walk	1
so	1
fast!	1
Speak,	1
father,	1
speak	1
to	1
you	1
little	1
boy,	1
Or	1
else	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
lost."	1
The	1
night	1
was	1
dark,	1
no	1
father	1
was	1
there,	1
The	1
child	1
was	1
wet	1
with	1
dew;	1
The	1
mire	1
was	1
deep,	1
and	1
the	1
child	1
did	1
weep,	1
And	1
away	1
the	1
vapour	1
flew.	1
THE	1
LITTLE	1
BOY	1
FOUND	1
The	1
little	1
boy	1
lost	1
in	1
the	1
lonely	1
fen,	1
Led	1
by	1
the	1
wandering	1
light,	1
Began	1
to	1
cry,	1
but	1
God,	1
ever	1
nigh,	1
Appeared	1
like	1
his	1
father,	1
in	1
white.	1
He	1
kissed	1
the	1
child,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
led,	1
And	1
to	1
his	1
mother	1
brought,	1
Who	1
in	1
sorrow	1
pale,	1
through	1
the	1
lonely	1
dale,	1
The	1
little	1
boy	1
weeping	1
sought.	1
LAUGHING	1
SONG	1
When	1
the	1
green	1
woods	1
laugh	1
with	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
joy,	1
And	1
the	1
dimpling	1
stream	1
runs	1
laughing	1
by;	1
When	1
the	1
air	1
does	1
laugh	1
with	1
our	1
merry	1
wit,	1
And	1
the	1
green	1
hill	1
laughs	1
with	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
it;	1
when	1
the	1
meadows	1
laugh	1
with	1
lively	1
green,	1
And	1
the	1
grasshopper	1
laughs	1
in	1
the	1
merry	1
scene,	1
When	1
Mary	1
and	1
Susan	1
and	1
Emily	1
With	1
their	1
sweet	1
round	1
mouths	1
sing	1
"Ha,	1
ha	1
he!"	1
When	1
the	1
painted	1
birds	1
laugh	1
in	1
the	1
shade,	1
Where	1
our	1
table	1
with	1
cherries	1
and	1
nuts	1
is	1
spread:	1
Come	1
live,	1
and	1
be	1
merry,	1
and	1
join	1
with	1
me,	1
To	1
sing	1
the	1
sweet	1
chorus	1
of	1
"Ha,	1
ha,	1
he!"	1
A	1
SONG	1
Sweet	1
dreams,	1
form	1
a	1
shade	1
O'er	1
my	1
lovely	1
infant's	1
head!	1
Sweet	1

of	1
pleasant	1
streams	1
By	1
happy,	1
silent,	1
moony	1
beams!	1
Sweet	1
Sleep,	1

soft	1
down	1
Weave	1
thy	1
brows	1
an	1

crown	1
Sweet	1

mild,	1
Hover	1
o'er	1
my	1
happy	1
child!	1
Sweet	1
smiles,	1
in	1
the	1
night	1
Hover	1
over	1
my	1
delight!	1
Sweet	1
smiles,	1
mother's	1
smile,	1
All	1
the	1
livelong	1
night	1
beguile.	1
Sweet	1
moans,	1
dovelike	1
sighs,	1
Chase	1
not	1
slumber	1
from	1
thine	1
eyes!	1
Sweet	1
moan,	1
sweeter	1
smile,	1
All	1
the	1
dovelike	1
moans	1
beguile.	1
Sleep,	1
sleep,	1
happy	1
child!	1
All	1
creation	1
slept	1
and	1
smiled.	1
Sleep,	1
sleep,	1
happy	1
sleep,	1
While	1
o'er	1
thee	1
doth	1
mother	1
weep.	1
Sweet	1
babe,	1
in	1
thy	1
face	1
Holy	1
image	1
I	1
can	1
trace;	1
Sweet	1
babe,	1
once	1
like	1
thee	1
Thy	1
Maker	1
lay,	1
and	1
wept	1
for	1
me:	1
Wept	1
for	1
me,	1
for	1
thee,	1
for	1
all,	1
When	1
He	1
was	1
an	1
infant	1
small.	1
Thou	1
His	1
image	1
ever	1
see,	1
Heavenly	1
face	1
that	1
smiles	1
on	1
thee!	1
Smiles	1
on	1
thee,	1
on	1
me,	1
on	1
all,	1
Who	1
became	1
an	1
infant	1
small;	1
Infant	1
smiles	1
are	1
his	1
own	1
smiles;	1
Heaven	1
and	1
earth	1
to	1
peace	1
beguiles.	1

pray	1
in	1
their	1
distress,	1
And	1
to	1
these	1
virtues	1
of	1

Return	1
their	1

For	1
Mercy,	1
Pity,	1

Is	1
God	1
our	1
Father	1
dear;	1
And	1
Mercy,	1

And	1
Love,	1

Then	1
every	1

every	1
clime,	1
That	1
prays	1
in	1
his	1
distress,	1
Prays	1
to	1
the	1
human	1

divine:	1
Love,	1
Mercy,	1
Pity,	1
Peace.	1
And	1
all	1
must	1
love	1
the	1
human	1
form,	1
In	1
heathen,	1
Turk,	1
or	1
Jew.	1
Where	1
Mercy,	1
Love,	1
and	1
Pity	1
dwell,	1
There	1
God	1
is	1
dwelling	1
too.	1
HOLY	1
THURSDAY	1
'Twas	1
on	1
a	1
Holy	1
Thursday,	1
their	1
innocent	1
faces	1
clean,	1
Came	1
children	1
walking	1
two	1
and	1
two,	1
in	1
read,	1
and	1
blue,	1
and	1
green:	1
Grey-headed	1
beadles	1
walked	1
before,	1
with	1
wands	1
as	1
white	1
as	1
snow,	1
Till	1
into	1
the	1
high	1
dome	1
of	1
Paul's	1
they	1
like	1
Thames	1
waters	1
flow.	1
Oh	1
what	1
a	1
multitude	1
they	1
seemed,	1
these	1
flowers	1
of	1
London	1
town!	1
Seated	1
in	1
companies	1
they	1
sit,	1
with	1
radiance	1
all	1
their	1
own.	1
The	1
hum	1
of	1
multitudes	1
was	1
there,	1
but	1
multitudes	1
of	1
lambs,	1
Thousands	1
of	1
little	1
boys	1
and	1
girls	1
raising	1
their	1
innocent	1
hands.	1
Now	1
like	1
a	1
mighty	1
wild	1
they	1
raise	1
to	1
heaven	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
song,	1
Or	1
like	1
harmonious	1
thunderings	1
the	1
seats	1
of	1
heaven	1
among:	1
Beneath	1
them	1
sit	1
the	1
aged	1
man,	1
wise	1
guardians	1
of	1
the	1
poor.	1
Then	1
cherish	1
pity,	1
lest	1
you	1
drive	1
an	1
angel	1
from	1
your	1
door.	1
NIGHT	1
The	1
sun	1
descending	1
in	1
the	1
west,	1
The	1
evening	1
star	1
does	1
shine;	1
The	1
birds	1
are	1
silent	1
in	1
their	1
nest,	1
And	1
I	1
must	1
seek	1
for	1
mine.	1
The	1
moon,	1
like	1
a	1
flower	1
In	1
heaven's	1
high	1
bower,	1
With	1
silent	1
delight,	1
Sits	1
and	1
smiles	1
on	1
the	1
night.	1
Farewell,	1
green	1
fields	1
and	1
happy	1
grove,	1
Where	1
flocks	1
have	1
ta'en	1
delight.	1
Where	1
lambs	1
have	1
nibbled,	1
silent	1
move	1
The	1
feet	1
of	1
angels	1
bright;	1
Unseen	1
they	1
pour	1
blessing,	1
And	1
joy	1
without	1
ceasing,	1
On	1
each	1
bud	1
and	1
blossom,	1
And	1
each	1
sleeping	1
bosom.	1
They	1
look	1
in	1
every	1
thoughtless	1
nest	1
Where	1
birds	1
are	1
covered	1
warm;	1
They	1
visit	1
caves	1
of	1
every	1
beast,	1
To	1
keep	1
them	1
all	1
from	1
harm:	1
If	1
they	1
see	1
any	1
weeping	1
That	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
sleeping,	1
They	1
pour	1
sleep	1
on	1
their	1
head,	1
And	1
sit	1
down	1
by	1
their	1
bed.	1
When	1
wolves	1
and	1
tigers	1
howl	1
for	1
prey,	1
They	1
pitying	1
stand	1
and	1
weep;	1
Seeking	1
to	1
drive	1
their	1
thirst	1
away,	1
And	1
keep	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
sheep.	1
But,	1
if	1
they	1
rush	1
dreadful,	1
The	1
angels,	1
most	1
heedful,	1
Receive	1
each	1
mild	1
spirit,	1
New	1
worlds	1
to	1
inherit.	1
And	1
there	1
the	1
lion's	1
ruddy	1
eyes	1
Shall	1
flow	1
with	1
tears	1
of	1
gold:	1
And	1
pitying	1
the	1
tender	1
cries,	1
And	1
walking	1
round	1
the	1
fold:	1
Saying:	1
"Wrath	1
by	1
His	1
meekness,	1
And,	1
by	1
His	1
health,	1
sickness,	1
Are	1
driven	1
away	1
From	1
our	1
immortal	1
day.	1
"And	1
now	1
beside	1
thee,	1
bleating	1
lamb,	1
I	1
can	1
lie	1
down	1
and	1
sleep,	1
Or	1
think	1
on	1
Him	1
who	1
bore	1
thy	1
name,	1
Graze	1
after	1
thee,	1
and	1
weep.	1
For,	1
washed	1
in	1
life's	1
river,	1
My	1
bright	1
mane	1
for	1
ever	1
Shall	1
shine	1
like	1
the	1
gold,	1
As	1
I	1
guard	1
o'er	1
the	1
fold."	1
SPRING	1
Sound	1
the	1
flute!	1
Now	1
it's	1
mute!	1
Bird's	1
delight,	1
Day	1
and	1
night,	1
Nightingale,	1
In	1
the	1
dale,	1
Lark	1
in	1
sky,--	1
Merrily,	1
Merrily	1
merrily,	1
to	1
welcome	1
in	1
the	1

Little	1
boy,	1
Full	1
of	1
joy;	1
Little	1

Sweet	1
and	1
small;	1
Cock	1
does	1

So	1
do	1
you;	1
Merry	1

Infant	1
noise;	1
Merrily,	1
merrily,	1
to	1
welcome	1

Little	1

Here	1
I	1
am;	1
Come	1
and	1
lick	1
My	1
white	1
neck;	1
Let	1
me	1
pull	1
Your	1
soft	1
wool;	1
Let	1
me	1

Your	1
soft	1
face;	1
Merrily,	1

NURSE'S	1
SONG	1
When	1
the	1
voices	1
of	1
children	1
are	1
heard	1
on	1
the	1
green,	1
And	1
laughing	1
is	1
heard	1
on	1
the	1
hill,	1
My	1
heart	1
is	1
at	1
rest	1
within	1
my	1
breast,	1
And	1
everything	1
else	1
is	1
still.	1
"Then	1
come	1
home,	1
my	1
children,	1
the	1
sun	1
is	1
gone	1
down,	1
And	1
the	1
dews	1
of	1
night	1
arise;	1
Come,	1
come,	1
leave	1
off	1
play,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
away,	1
Till	1
the	1
morning	1
appears	1
in	1
the	1
skies."	1
"No,	1
no,	1
let	1
us	1
play,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
yet	1
day,	1
And	1
we	1
cannot	1
go	1
to	1
sleep;	1
Besides,	1
in	1
the	1
sky	1
the	1
little	1
birds	1
fly,	1
And	1
the	1
hills	1
are	1
all	1
covered	1
with	1
sheep."	1
"Well,	1
well,	1
go	1
and	1
play	1
till	1
the	1
light	1
fades	1
away,	1
And	1
then	1
go	1
home	1
to	1
bed."	1
The	1
little	1
ones	1
leaped,	1
and	1
shouted,	1
and	1
laughed,	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
hills	1
echoed.	1
INFANT	1
JOY	1
"I	1
have	1
no	1
name;	1
I	1
am	1
but	1
two	1
days	1
old."	1
What	1
shall	1
I	1
call	1
thee?	1
"I	1
happy	1
am,	1
Joy	1
is	1
my	1
name."	1
Sweet	1
joy	1
befall	1
thee!	1
Pretty	1
joy!	1
Sweet	1
joy,	1
but	1
two	1
days	1
old.	1
Sweet	1
Joy	1
I	1
call	1
thee:	1
Thou	1
dost	1
smile,	1
I	1
sing	1
the	1
while;	1
Sweet	1
joy	1
befall	1
thee!	1
A	1
DREAM	1
Once	1
a	1
dream	1
did	1
weave	1
a	1
shade	1
O'er	1
my	1
angel-guarded	1
bed,	1
That	1
an	1
emmet	1
lost	1
its	1
way	1
Where	1
on	1
grass	1
methought	1
I	1
lay.	1
Troubled,	1
wildered,	1
and	1
forlorn,	1
Dark,	1
benighted,	1
travel-worn,	1
Over	1
many	1
a	1
tangle	1
spray,	1
All	1
heart-broke,	1
I	1
heard	1
her	1
say:	1
"Oh	1
my	1
children!	1
do	1
they	1
cry,	1
Do	1
they	1
hear	1
their	1
father	1
sigh?	1
Now	1
they	1
look	1
abroad	1
to	1
see,	1
Now	1
return	1
and	1
weep	1
for	1
me."	1
Pitying,	1
I	1
dropped	1
a	1
tear:	1
But	1
I	1
saw	1
a	1
glow-worm	1
near,	1
Who	1
replied,	1
"What	1
wailing	1
wight	1
Calls	1
the	1
watchman	1
of	1
the	1
night?	1
"I	1
am	1
set	1
to	1
light	1
the	1
ground,	1
While	1
the	1
beetle	1
goes	1
his	1
round:	1
Follow	1
now	1
the	1
beetle's	1
hum;	1
Little	1
wanderer,	1
hie	1
thee	1
home!"	1
ON	1
ANOTHER'S	1
SORROW	1
Can	1
I	1
see	1
another's	1
woe,	1
And	1
not	1
be	1
in	1
sorrow	1
too?	1
Can	1
I	1
see	1
another's	1
grief,	1
And	1
not	1
seek	1
for	1
kind	1
relief?	1
Can	1
I	1
see	1
a	1
falling	1
tear,	1
And	1
not	1
feel	1
my	1
sorrow's	1
share?	1
Can	1
a	1
father	1
see	1
his	1
child	1
Weep,	1
nor	1
be	1
with	1
sorrow	1
filled?	1
Can	1
a	1
mother	1
sit	1
and	1
hear	1
An	1
infant	1
groan,	1
an	1
infant	1
fear?	1
No,	1
no!	1
never	1
can	1
it	1
be!	1
Never,	1
never	1
can	1
it	1
be!	1
And	1
can	1
He	1
who	1
smiles	1
on	1
all	1
Hear	1
the	1
wren	1
with	1
sorrows	1
small,	1
Hear	1
the	1
small	1
bird's	1
grief	1
and	1
care,	1
Hear	1
the	1
woes	1
that	1
infants	1
bear	1
--	1
And	1
not	1
sit	1
beside	1
the	1
next,	1
Pouring	1
pity	1
in	1
their	1
breast,	1
And	1
not	1
sit	1
the	1
cradle	1
near,	1
Weeping	1
tear	1
on	1
infant's	1
tear?	1
And	1
not	1
sit	1
both	1
night	1
and	1
day,	1
Wiping	1
all	1
our	1
tears	1
away?	1
Oh	1
no!	1
never	1
can	1
it	1
be!	1
Never,	1
never	1
can	1
it	1
be!	1
He	1
doth	1
give	1
his	1
joy	1
to	1
all:	1
He	1
becomes	1
an	1
infant	1
small,	1
He	1
becomes	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
woe,	1
He	1
doth	1
feel	1
the	1
sorrow	1
too.	1
Think	1
not	1
thou	1
canst	1
sigh	1
a	1
sigh,	1
And	1
thy	1
Maker	1
is	1
not	1
by:	1
Think	1
not	1
thou	1
canst	1
weep	1
a	1
tear,	1
And	1
thy	1
Maker	1
is	1
not	1
year.	1
Oh	1
He	1
gives	1
to	1
us	1
his	1
joy,	1
That	1
our	1
grief	1
He	1
may	1
destroy:	1
Till	1
our	1
grief	1
is	1
fled	1
an	1
gone	1
He	1
doth	1
sit	1
by	1
us	1
and	1
moan.	1
SONGS	1
OF	1
EXPERIENCE	1
INTRODUCTION	1
Hear	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
Bard,	1
Who	1
present,	1
past,	1
and	1
future,	1
sees;	1
Whose	1
ears	1
have	1
heard	1
The	1
Holy	1
Word	1
That	1
walked	1
among	1
the	1
ancient	1
tree;	1
Calling	1
the	1
lapsed	1
soul,	1
And	1
weeping	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
dew;	1
That	1
might	1
control	1
The	1
starry	1
pole,	1
And	1
fallen,	1
fallen	1
light	1
renew!	1
"O	1
Earth,	1
O	1
Earth,	1
return!	1
Arise	1
from	1
out	1
the	1
dewy	1
grass!	1
Night	1
is	1
worn,	1
And	1
the	1
morn	1
Rises	1
from	1
the	1
slumbrous	1
mass.	1
"Turn	1
away	1
no	1
more;	1
Why	1
wilt	1
thou	1
turn	1
away?	1
The	1
starry	1
floor,	1
The	1

Are	1

EARTH'S	1
ANSWER	1
Earth	1
raised	1
up	1
her	1
head	1
From	1
the	1
darkness	1
dread	1
and	1
drear,	1
Her	1
light	1
fled,	1
Stony,	1
dread,	1
And	1
her	1
locks	1
covered	1
with	1
grey	1
despair.	1
"Prisoned	1
on	1
watery	1
shore,	1
Starry	1
jealousy	1
does	1
keep	1
my	1
den	1
Cold	1
and	1
hoar;	1
Weeping	1
o're,	1
I	1
hear	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
the	1
ancient	1
men.	1
"Selfish	1
father	1
of	1
men!	1
Cruel,	1
jealous,	1
selfish	1
fear!	1
Can	1
delight,	1
Chained	1
in	1
night,	1
The	1
virgins	1
of	1
youth	1
and	1
morning	1
bear?	1
"Does	1
spring	1
hide	1
its	1
joy,	1
When	1
buds	1
and	1
blossoms	1
grow?	1
Does	1
the	1
sower	1
Sow	1
by	1
night,	1
Or	1
the	1
plowman	1
in	1
darkness	1
plough?	1
"Break	1
this	1
heavy	1
chain,	1
That	1
does	1
freeze	1
my	1
bones	1
around!	1
Selfish,	1
vain,	1
Eternal	1
bane,	1
That	1
free	1
love	1
with	1
bondage	1
bound."	1
THE	1
CLOD	1
AND	1
THE	1
PEBBLE	1
"Love	1
seeketh	1
not	1
itself	1
to	1
please,	1
Nor	1
for	1
itself	1
hath	1
any	1
care,	1
But	1
for	1
another	1
gives	1
it	1
ease,	1
And	1
builds	1
a	1
heaven	1

So	1
sang	1
a	1
little	1
clod	1
of	1
clay,	1
Trodden	1
with	1
the	1
cattle's	1
feet,	1
But	1
a	1
pebble	1
of	1
the	1
brook	1
Warbled	1
out	1
these	1
metres	1
meet:	1
"Love	1

To	1
bind	1
another	1
to	1
its	1
delight,	1
Joys	1
in	1
another's	1
loss	1
of	1
ease,	1
And	1
builds	1
a	1
hell	1
in	1
heaven's	1
despite."	1
HOLY	1
THURSDAY	1
Is	1
this	1
a	1
holy	1
thing	1
to	1
see	1
In	1
a	1
rich	1
and	1
fruitful	1
land,	1
--	1
Babes	1
reduced	1
to	1
misery,	1
Fed	1
with	1
cold	1
and	1
usurous	1
hand?	1
Is	1
that	1
trembling	1
cry	1
a	1
song?	1
Can	1
it	1
be	1
a	1
song	1
of	1
joy?	1
And	1
so	1
many	1
children	1
poor?	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
land	1
of	1
poverty!	1
And	1
their	1
son	1
does	1
never	1
shine,	1
And	1
their	1
fields	1
are	1
bleak	1
and	1
bare,	1
And	1
their	1
ways	1
are	1
filled	1
with	1
thorns:	1
It	1
is	1
eternal	1
winter	1
there.	1
For	1
where'er	1
the	1
sun	1
does	1
shine,	1
And	1
where'er	1
the	1
rain	1
does	1
fall,	1
Babes	1
should	1
never	1
hunger	1
there,	1
Nor	1
poverty	1
the	1
mind	1
appall.	1
THE	1
LITTLE	1
GIRL	1
LOST	1
In	1
futurity	1
I	1
prophetic	1
see	1
That	1
the	1
earth	1
from	1
sleep	1
(Grave	1
the	1
sentence	1
deep)	1
Shall	1
arise,	1
and	1
seek	1
for	1
her	1
Maker	1
meek;	1
And	1
the	1
desert	1
wild	1
Become	1
a	1
garden	1
mild.	1
In	1
the	1
southern	1
clime,	1
Where	1
the	1
summer's	1
prime	1
Never	1
fades	1
away,	1
Lovely	1
Lyca	1
lay.	1
Seven	1
summers	1
old	1
Lovely	1
Lyca	1
told.	1
She	1
had	1
wandered	1
long,	1
Hearing	1
wild	1
birds'	1
song.	1
"Sweet	1
sleep,	1
come	1
to	1
me	1
Underneath	1
this	1
tree;	1
Do	1
father,	1
mother,	1
weep?	1
Where	1
can	1
Lyca	1
sleep?	1
"Lost	1
in	1
desert	1
wild	1
Is	1
your	1
little	1
child.	1
How	1
can	1
Lyca	1
sleep	1
If	1
her	1
mother	1
weep?	1
"If	1
her	1
heart	1
does	1
ache,	1
Then	1
let	1
Lyca	1
wake;	1
If	1
my	1
mother	1
sleep,	1
Lyca	1
shall	1
not	1
weep.	1
"Frowning,	1
frowning	1
night,	1
O'er	1
this	1
desert	1
bright	1
Let	1
thy	1
moon	1
arise,	1
While	1
I	1
close	1
my	1

Sleeping	1
Lyca	1
lay	1
While	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
prey,	1
Come	1
from	1
caverns	1
deep,	1
Viewed	1
the	1
maid	1
asleep.	1
The	1
kingly	1
lion	1
stood,	1
And	1
the	1
virgin	1
viewed:	1
Then	1
he	1
gambolled	1
round	1
O'er	1
the	1
hallowed	1
ground.	1
Leopards,	1
tigers,	1
play	1
Round	1
her	1
as	1
she	1
lay;	1
While	1
the	1
lion	1
old	1
Bowed	1
his	1
mane	1
of	1
gold,	1
And	1
her	1
breast	1
did	1
lick	1
And	1
upon	1
her	1
neck,	1
From	1
his	1
eyes	1
of	1
flame,	1
Ruby	1
tears	1
there	1
came;	1
While	1
the	1
lioness	1
Loosed	1
her	1
slender	1
dress,	1
And	1
naked	1
they	1
conveyed	1
To	1
caves	1
the	1
sleeping	1
maid.	1
THE	1

FOUND	1
All	1
the	1
night	1
in	1
woe	1
Lyca's	1
parents	1
go	1
Over	1
valleys	1
deep,	1
While	1
the	1
deserts	1
weep.	1
Tired	1
and	1
woe-begone,	1
Hoarse	1
with	1
making	1
moan,	1
Arm	1
in	1

seven	1

traced	1
the	1
desert	1
ways.	1
Seven	1
nights	1
they	1
sleep	1
Among	1
shadows	1
deep,	1
And	1
dream	1
they	1
see	1
their	1
child	1
Starved	1
in	1
desert	1
wild.	1
Pale	1
through	1
pathless	1
ways	1
The	1
fancied	1
image	1
strays,	1
Famished,	1
weeping,	1
weak,	1
With	1
hollow	1
piteous	1
shriek.	1
Rising	1
from	1
unrest,	1
The	1
trembling	1
woman	1
presse	1
With	1
feet	1
of	1
weary	1
woe;	1
She	1
could	1
no	1
further	1
go.	1
In	1
his	1
arms	1
he	1
bore	1
Her,	1
armed	1
with	1
sorrow	1
sore;	1
Till	1
before	1
their	1
way	1
A	1
couching	1
lion	1
lay.	1
Turning	1
back	1
was	1
vain:	1
Soon	1
his	1
heavy	1
mane	1
Bore	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
ground,	1
Then	1
he	1
stalked	1
around,	1
Smelling	1
to	1
his	1
prey;	1
But	1
their	1
fears	1
allay	1
When	1
he	1
licks	1
their	1
hands,	1
And	1
silent	1
by	1
them	1
stands.	1
They	1
look	1
upon	1
his	1
eyes,	1
Filled	1
with	1
deep	1
surprise;	1
And	1
wondering	1
behold	1
A	1
spirit	1
armed	1
in	1
gold.	1
On	1
his	1
head	1
a	1
crown,	1
On	1
his	1
shoulders	1
down	1
Flowed	1
his	1
golden	1
hair.	1
Gone	1
was	1
all	1
their	1
care.	1
"Follow	1
me,"	1
he	1
said;	1
"Weep	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
maid;	1
In	1
my	1
palace	1
deep,	1
Lyca	1
lies	1
asleep."	1
Then	1
they	1
followed	1
Where	1
the	1
vision	1
led,	1
And	1
saw	1
their	1
sleeping	1
child	1
Among	1
tigers	1
wild.	1
To	1
this	1
day	1
they	1
dwell	1
In	1
a	1
lonely	1
dell,	1
Nor	1
fear	1
the	1
wolvish	1
howl	1
Nor	1
the	1
lion's	1
growl.	1
THE	1
CHIMNEY	1
SWEEPER	1
A	1
little	1
black	1
thing	1
in	1
the	1
snow,	1
Crying	1
"weep!	1
weep!"	1
in	1
notes	1
of	1
woe!	1
"Where	1
are	1
thy	1
father	1
and	1
mother?	1
Say!"--	1
"They	1
are	1
both	1
gone	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
church	1
to	1
pray.	1
"Because	1
I	1
was	1
happy	1
upon	1
the	1
heath,	1
And	1
smiled	1
among	1
the	1
winter's	1
snow,	1
They	1
clothed	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
clothes	1
of	1
death,	1
And	1
taught	1
me	1
to	1
sing	1
the	1
notes	1
of	1
woe.	1
"And	1
because	1
I	1
am	1
happy	1
and	1
dance	1
and	1
sing,	1
They	1
think	1
they	1
have	1
done	1
me	1
no	1
injury,	1
And	1
are	1
gone	1
to	1
praise	1
God	1
and	1
his	1
priest	1
and	1
king,	1
Who	1
make	1
up	1
a	1
heaven	1
of	1
our	1
misery."	1
NURSE'S	1
SONG	1
When	1
voices	1
of	1
children	1
are	1
heard	1
on	1
the	1
green,	1
And	1
whisperings	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
dale,	1
The	1
days	1
of	1
my	1
youth	1
rise	1
fresh	1
in	1
my	1
mind,	1
My	1
face	1
turns	1
green	1
and	1
pale.	1
Then	1
come	1
home,	1
my	1
children,	1
the	1
sun	1
is	1
gone	1
down,	1
And	1
the	1
dews	1
of	1
night	1
arise;	1
Your	1
spring	1
and	1
your	1
day	1
are	1
wasted	1
in	1
play,	1
And	1
your	1
winter	1
and	1
night	1
in	1
disguise.	1
THE	1
SICK	1
ROSE	1
O	1
rose,	1
thou	1
art	1
sick!	1
The	1
invisible	1
worm,	1
That	1
flies	1
in	1
the	1
night,	1
In	1
the	1
howling	1
storm,	1
Has	1
found	1
out	1
thy	1
bed	1
Of	1
crimson	1
joy,	1
And	1
his	1
dark	1
secret	1
love	1
Does	1
thy	1
life	1
destroy.	1
THE	1
FLY	1
Little	1
Fly,	1
Thy	1
summer's	1
play	1
My	1
thoughtless	1
hand	1
Has	1
brushed	1
away.	1
Am	1
not	1
I	1
A	1
fly	1
like	1
thee?	1
Or	1
art	1
not	1
thou	1
A	1
man	1
like	1
me?	1
For	1
I	1
dance	1
And	1
drink,	1
and	1
sing,	1
Till	1
some	1
blind	1
hand	1
Shall	1
brush	1
my	1
wing.	1
If	1
thought	1
is	1
life	1
And	1
strength	1
and	1
breath	1
And	1
the	1
want	1
Of	1
thought	1
is	1
death;	1
Then	1
am	1
I	1
A	1
happy	1
fly,	1
If	1
I	1
live,	1
Or	1
if	1
I	1
die.	1
THE	1
ANGEL	1
I	1
dreamt	1
a	1
dream!	1
What	1
can	1
it	1
mean?	1
And	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
maiden	1
Queen	1
Guarded	1
by	1
an	1
Angel	1
mild:	1
Witless	1
woe	1
was	1
ne'er	1
beguiled!	1
And	1
I	1
wept	1
both	1
night	1
and	1
day,	1
And	1
he	1
wiped	1
my	1
tears	1
away;	1
And	1
I	1
wept	1
both	1
day	1
and	1
night,	1
And	1
hid	1
from	1
him	1
my	1
heart's	1
delight.	1
So	1
he	1
took	1
his	1
wings,	1
and	1
fled;	1
Then	1
the	1
morn	1
blushed	1
rosy	1
red.	1
I	1
dried	1
my	1
tears,	1
and	1
armed	1
my	1
fears	1
With	1
ten-thousand	1
shields	1
and	1
spears.	1
Soon	1
my	1
Angel	1
came	1
again;	1
I	1
was	1
armed,	1
he	1
came	1
in	1
vain;	1
For	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
youth	1
was	1
fled,	1
And	1
grey	1
hairs	1
were	1
on	1
my	1
head.	1
THE	1
TIGER	1
Tiger,	1
tiger,	1
burning	1
bright	1
In	1
the	1
forest	1
of	1
the	1
night,	1
What	1
immortal	1
hand	1
or	1
eye	1
Could	1
Frame	1
thy	1
fearful	1
symmetry?	1
In	1
what	1
distant	1
deeps	1
or	1
skies	1
Burnt	1
the	1
fire	1
of	1
thine	1
eyes?	1
On	1
what	1
wings	1
dare	1
he	1
aspire?	1
What	1
the	1
hand	1
dare	1
seize	1
the	1
fire?	1
And	1
what	1
shoulder	1
and	1
what	1
art	1
Could	1
twist	1
the	1
sinews	1
of	1
thy	1
heart?	1
And,	1
when	1
thy	1
heart	1
began	1
to	1
beat,	1
What	1
dread	1
hand	1
and	1
what	1
dread	1
feet?	1
What	1
the	1
hammer?	1
what	1
the	1
chain?	1
In	1
what	1
furnace	1
was	1
thy	1
brain?	1
What	1
the	1
anvil?	1
what	1
dread	1
grasp	1
Dare	1
its	1
deadly	1
terrors	1
clasp?	1
When	1
the	1
stars	1
threw	1
down	1
their	1
spears,	1
And	1
watered	1
heaven	1
with	1
their	1
tears,	1
Did	1
he	1
smile	1
his	1
work	1
to	1
see?	1
Did	1
he	1
who	1
made	1
the	1
lamb	1
make	1
thee?	1
Tiger,	1
tiger,	1
burning	1
bright	1
In	1
the	1
forests	1
of	1
the	1
night,	1
What	1
immortal	1
hand	1
or	1
eye	1
Dare	1
frame	1
thy	1
fearful	1
symmetry?	1
MY	1
PRETTY	1
ROSE	1
TREE	1
A	1
flower	1
was	1
offered	1
to	1
me,	1
Such	1
a	1
flower	1
as	1
May	1
never	1
bore;	1
But	1
I	1
said	1
"I've	1
a	1
pretty	1
rose	1
tree,"	1
And	1
I	1
passed	1
the	1
sweet	1
flower	1
o'er.	1
Then	1
I	1
went	1
to	1
my	1
pretty	1
rose	1
tree,	1
To	1
tend	1
her	1
by	1
day	1
and	1
by	1
night;	1
But	1
my	1
rose	1
turned	1
away	1
with	1
jealousy,	1
And	1
her	1
thorns	1
were	1
my	1
only	1
delight.	1
AH	1
SUNFLOWER	1
Ah	1
Sunflower,	1
weary	1
of	1
time,	1
Who	1
countest	1
the	1
steps	1
of	1
the	1
sun;	1
Seeking	1
after	1
that	1
sweet	1
golden	1
clime	1
Where	1
the	1
traveller's	1
journey	1
is	1
done;	1
Where	1
the	1
Youth	1
pined	1
away	1
with	1
desire,	1
And	1
the	1
pale	1
virgin	1
shrouded	1
in	1
snow,	1
Arise	1
from	1
their	1
graves,	1
and	1
aspire	1
Where	1
my	1
Sunflower	1
wishes	1
to	1
go!	1
THE	1
LILY	1
The	1
modest	1
Rose	1
puts	1
forth	1
a	1
thorn,	1
The	1
humble	1
sheep	1
a	1
threat'ning	1
horn:	1
While	1
the	1
Lily	1
white	1
shall	1
in	1
love	1
delight,	1
Nor	1
a	1
thorn	1
nor	1
a	1
threat	1
stain	1
her	1
beauty	1
bright.	1
THE	1
GARDEN	1
OF	1
LOVE	1
I	1
laid	1
me	1
down	1
upon	1
a	1
bank,	1
Where	1
Love	1
lay	1
sleeping;	1
I	1
heard	1
among	1
the	1
rushes	1
dank	1
Weeping,	1
weeping.	1
Then	1
I	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
heath	1
and	1
the	1
wild,	1
To	1
the	1
thistles	1
and	1
thorns	1
of	1
the	1
waste;	1
And	1
they	1
told	1
me	1
how	1
they	1
were	1
beguiled,	1
Driven	1
out,	1
and	1
compelled	1
to	1
the	1
chaste.	1
I	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
Garden	1
of	1
Love,	1
And	1
saw	1
what	1
I	1
never	1
had	1
seen;	1
A	1
Chapel	1
was	1
built	1
in	1
the	1
midst,	1
Where	1
I	1
used	1
to	1
play	1
on	1
the	1
green.	1
And	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
this	1
Chapel	1
were	1
shut	1
And	1
"Thou	1
shalt	1
not,"	1
writ	1
over	1
the	1
door;	1
So	1
I	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
Garden	1
of	1
Love	1
That	1
so	1
many	1
sweet	1
flowers	1
bore.	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
it	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
graves,	1
And	1
tombstones	1
where	1
flowers	1
should	1
be;	1
And	1
priests	1
in	1
black	1
gowns	1
were	1
walking	1
their	1
rounds,	1
And	1
binding	1
with	1
briars	1
my	1
joys	1
and	1
desires.	1
THE	1
LITTLE	1
VAGABOND	1
Dear	1
mother,	1
dear	1
mother,	1
the	1
Church	1
is	1
cold;	1
But	1
the	1
Alehouse	1
is	1
healthy,	1
and	1
pleasant,	1
and	1
warm.	1
Besides,	1
I	1
can	1
tell	1
where	1
I	1
am	1
used	1
well;	1
The	1
poor	1
parsons	1
with	1
wind	1
like	1
a	1
blown	1
bladder	1
swell.	1
But,	1
if	1
at	1
the	1
Church	1
they	1
would	1
give	1
us	1
some	1
ale,	1
And	1
a	1
pleasant	1
fire	1
our	1
souls	1
to	1
regale,	1
We'd	1
sing	1
and	1
we'd	1
pray	1
all	1
the	1
livelong	1
day,	1
Nor	1
ever	1
once	1
wish	1
from	1
the	1
Church	1
to	1
stray.	1
Then	1
the	1
Parson	1
might	1
preach,	1
and	1
drink,	1
and	1
sing,	1
And	1
we'd	1
be	1
as	1
happy	1
as	1
birds	1
in	1
the	1
spring;	1
And	1
modest	1
Dame	1
Lurch,	1
who	1
is	1
always	1
at	1
church,	1
Would	1
not	1
have	1
bandy	1
children,	1
nor	1
fasting,	1
nor	1
birch.	1
And	1
God,	1
like	1
a	1
father,	1
rejoicing	1
to	1
see	1
His	1
children	1
as	1
pleasant	1
and	1
happy	1
as	1
he,	1
Would	1
have	1
no	1
more	1
quarrel	1
with	1
the	1
Devil	1
or	1
the	1
barrel,	1
But	1
kiss	1
him,	1
and	1
give	1
him	1
both	1
drink	1
and	1
apparel.	1
LONDON	1
I	1
wandered	1
through	1
each	1
chartered	1
street,	1
Near	1
where	1
the	1
chartered	1
Thames	1
does	1
flow,	1
A	1
mark	1
in	1
every	1
face	1
I	1
meet,	1
Marks	1
of	1
weakness,	1
marks	1
of	1
woe.	1
In	1
every	1
cry	1
of	1
every	1
man,	1
In	1
every	1
infant's	1
cry	1
of	1
fear,	1
In	1
every	1
voice,	1
in	1
every	1
ban,	1
The	1
mind-forged	1
manacles	1
I	1
hear:	1
How	1
the	1
chimney-sweeper's	1
cry	1
Every	1
blackening	1
church	1
appals,	1
And	1
the	1
hapless	1
soldier's	1
sigh	1
Runs	1
in	1
blood	1
down	1
palace-walls.	1
But	1
most,	1
through	1
midnight	1
streets	1
I	1
hear	1
How	1
the	1
youthful	1
harlot's	1
curse	1
Blasts	1
the	1
new-born	1
infant's	1
tear,	1
And	1
blights	1
with	1
plagues	1
the	1
marriage-hearse.	1
THE	1
HUMAN	1
ABSTRACT	1
Pity	1
would	1
be	1
no	1
more	1
If	1
we	1
did	1
not	1
make	1
somebody	1
poor,	1
And	1
Mercy	1
no	1
more	1
could	1
be	1
If	1
all	1
were	1
as	1
happy	1
as	1
we.	1
And	1
mutual	1
fear	1
brings	1
Peace,	1
Till	1
the	1
selfish	1
loves	1
increase	1
Then	1
Cruelty	1
knits	1
a	1
snare,	1
And	1
spreads	1
his	1
baits	1
with	1
care.	1
He	1
sits	1
down	1
with	1
his	1
holy	1
fears,	1
And	1
waters	1
the	1
ground	1
with	1
tears;	1
Then	1
Humility	1
takes	1
its	1
root	1
Underneath	1
his	1
foot.	1
Soon	1
spreads	1
the	1
dismal	1
shade	1
Of	1
Mystery	1
over	1
his	1
head,	1
And	1
the	1
caterpillar	1
and	1
fly	1
Feed	1
on	1
the	1
Mystery.	1
And	1
it	1
bears	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
Deceit,	1
Ruddy	1
and	1
sweet	1
to	1
eat,	1
And	1
the	1
raven	1
his	1
nest	1
has	1
made	1
In	1
its	1
thickest	1
shade.	1
The	1
gods	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
sea	1
Sought	1
through	1
nature	1
to	1
find	1
this	1
tree,	1
But	1
their	1
search	1
was	1
all	1
in	1
vain:	1
There	1
grows	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
human	1
Brain.	1
INFANT	1
SORROW	1
My	1
mother	1
groaned,	1
my	1
father	1
wept:	1
Into	1
the	1
dangerous	1
world	1
I	1
leapt,	1
Helpless,	1
naked,	1
piping	1
loud,	1
Like	1
a	1
fiend	1
hid	1
in	1
a	1
cloud.	1
Struggling	1
in	1
my	1
father's	1
hands,	1
Striving	1
against	1
my	1
swaddling-bands,	1
Bound	1
and	1
weary,	1
I	1
thought	1
best	1
To	1
sulk	1
upon	1
my	1
mother's	1
breast.	1
A	1
POISON	1
TREE	1
I	1
was	1
angry	1
with	1
my	1
friend:	1
I	1
told	1
my	1
wrath,	1
my	1
wrath	1
did	1
end.	1
I	1
was	1
angry	1
with	1
my	1
foe:	1
I	1
told	1
it	1
not,	1
my	1
wrath	1
did	1
grow.	1
And	1
I	1
watered	1
it	1
in	1
fears	1
Night	1
and	1
morning	1
with	1
my	1
tears,	1
And	1
I	1
sunned	1
it	1
with	1
smiles	1
And	1
with	1
soft	1
deceitful	1
wiles.	1
And	1
it	1
grew	1
both	1
day	1
and	1
night,	1
Till	1
it	1
bore	1
an	1
apple	1
bright,	1
And	1
my	1
foe	1
beheld	1
it	1
shine,	1
and	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
mine,	1
--	1
And	1
into	1
my	1
garden	1
stole	1
When	1
the	1
night	1
had	1
veiled	1
the	1
pole;	1
In	1
the	1
morning,	1
glad,	1
I	1
see	1
My	1
foe	1
outstretched	1
beneath	1
the	1
tree.	1

itself	1

"And,	1
father,	1
how	1
can	1
I	1
love	1
you	1
Or	1
any	1
of	1
my	1
brothers	1
more?	1
I	1
love	1
you	1
like	1
the	1
little	1
bird	1
That	1
picks	1
up	1
crumbs	1
around	1
the	1
door."	1
The	1
Priest	1
sat	1
by	1
and	1
heard	1
the	1
child;	1
In	1
trembling	1
zeal	1
he	1
seized	1
his	1
hair,	1
He	1
led	1
him	1
by	1
his	1
little	1
coat,	1
And	1
all	1
admired	1
the	1
priestly	1
care.	1
And	1
standing	1
on	1
the	1
altar	1
high,	1
"Lo,	1
what	1
a	1
fiend	1
is	1
here!	1
said	1
he:	1
"One	1
who	1
sets	1
reason	1
up	1
for	1
judge	1
Of	1
our	1
most	1
holy	1
mystery."	1
The	1
weeping	1
child	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
heard,	1
The	1
weeping	1
parents	1
wept	1
in	1
vain:	1
They	1
stripped	1
him	1
to	1
his	1
little	1
shirt,	1
And	1
bound	1
him	1
in	1
an	1
iron	1
chain,	1
And	1
burned	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
holy	1
place	1
Where	1
many	1
had	1
been	1
burned	1
before;	1
The	1
weeping	1
parents	1
wept	1
in	1
vain.	1
Are	1
such	1
thing	1
done	1
on	1
Albion's	1
shore?	1

GIRL	1
LOST	1
Children	1
of	1
the	1
future	1
age,	1
Reading	1
this	1
indignant	1
page,	1
Know	1
that	1
in	1
a	1
former	1
time	1
Love,	1
sweet	1
love,	1
was	1
thought	1
a	1
crime.	1
In	1
the	1
age	1
of	1
gold,	1
Free	1
from	1
winter's	1
cold,	1
Youth	1
and	1
maiden	1
bright,	1
To	1
the	1
holy	1
light,	1
Naked	1
in	1
the	1
sunny	1
beams	1
delight.	1
Once	1
a	1
youthful	1
pair,	1
Filled	1
with	1
softest	1
care,	1
Met	1
in	1
garden	1
bright	1
Where	1
the	1
holy	1
light	1
Had	1
just	1
removed	1
the	1
curtains	1
of	1
the	1
night.	1
Then,	1
in	1
rising	1
day,	1
On	1
the	1
grass	1
they	1
play;	1
Parents	1
were	1
afar,	1
Strangers	1
came	1
not	1
near,	1
And	1
the	1
maiden	1
soon	1
forgot	1
her	1
fear.	1
Tired	1
with	1
kisses	1
sweet,	1
They	1
agree	1
to	1
meet	1
When	1
the	1
silent	1
sleep	1
Waves	1
o'er	1
heaven's	1
deep,	1
And	1
the	1
weary	1
tired	1
wanderers	1
weep.	1
To	1
her	1
father	1
white	1
Came	1
the	1
maiden	1
bright;	1
But	1
his	1
loving	1
look,	1
Like	1
the	1
holy	1
book	1
All	1
her	1
tender	1
limbs	1
with	1
terror	1
shook.	1
"Ona,	1
pale	1
and	1
weak,	1
To	1
thy	1
father	1
speak!	1
Oh	1
the	1
trembling	1
fear!	1
Oh	1
the	1
dismal	1
care	1
That	1
shakes	1
the	1
blossoms	1
of	1
my	1
hoary	1
hair!"	1
THE	1
SCHOOLBOY	1
I	1
love	1
to	1
rise	1
on	1
a	1
summer	1
morn,	1
When	1
birds	1
are	1
singing	1
on	1
every	1
tree;	1
The	1
distant	1
huntsman	1
winds	1
his	1
horn,	1
And	1
the	1
skylark	1
sings	1
with	1
me:	1
Oh	1
what	1
sweet	1
company!	1
But	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
school	1
in	1
a	1
summer	1
morn,	1
--	1
Oh	1
it	1
drives	1
all	1
joy	1
away!	1
Under	1
a	1
cruel	1
eye	1
outworn,	1
The	1
little	1
ones	1
spend	1
the	1
day	1
In	1
sighing	1
and	1
dismay.	1
Ah	1
then	1
at	1
times	1
I	1
drooping	1
sit,	1
And	1
spend	1
many	1
an	1
anxious	1
hour;	1
Nor	1
in	1
my	1
book	1
can	1
I	1
take	1
delight,	1
Nor	1
sit	1
in	1
learning's	1
bower,	1
Worn	1
through	1
with	1
the	1
dreary	1
shower.	1
How	1
can	1
the	1
bird	1
that	1
is	1
born	1
for	1
joy	1
Sit	1
in	1
a	1
cage	1
and	1
sing?	1
How	1
can	1
a	1
child,	1
when	1
fears	1
annoy,	1
But	1
droop	1
his	1
tender	1
wing,	1
And	1
forget	1
his	1
youthful	1
spring?	1
Oh	1
father	1
and	1
mother,	1
if	1
buds	1
are	1
nipped,	1
And	1
blossoms	1
blown	1
away;	1
And	1
if	1
the	1
tender	1
plants	1
are	1
stripped	1
Of	1
their	1
joy	1
in	1
the	1
springing	1
day,	1
By	1
sorrow	1
and	1
care's	1
dismay,	1
--	1
How	1
shall	1
the	1
summer	1
arise	1
in	1
joy,	1
Or	1
the	1
summer	1
fruits	1
appear?	1
Or	1
how	1
shall	1
we	1
gather	1
what	1
griefs	1
destroy,	1
Or	1
bless	1
the	1
mellowing	1
year,	1
When	1
the	1
blasts	1
of	1
winter	1
appear?	1
TO	1
TERZAH	1
Whate'er	1
is	1
born	1
of	1
mortal	1
birth	1
Must	1
be	1
consumed	1
with	1
the	1
earth,	1
To	1
rise	1
from	1
generation	1
free:	1
Then	1
what	1
have	1
I	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
thee?	1
The	1
sexes	1
sprang	1
from	1
shame	1
and	1
pride,	1
Blown	1
in	1
the	1
morn,	1
in	1
evening	1
died;	1
But	1
mercy	1
changed	1
death	1
into	1
sleep;	1
The	1
sexes	1
rose	1
to	1
work	1
and	1
weep.	1
Thou,	1
mother	1
of	1
my	1
mortal	1
part,	1
With	1
cruelty	1
didst	1
mould	1
my	1
heart,	1
And	1
with	1
false	1
self-deceiving	1
tears	1
Didst	1
bind	1
my	1
nostrils,	1
eyes,	1
and	1
ears,	1
Didst	1
close	1
my	1
tongue	1
in	1
senseless	1
clay,	1
And	1
me	1
to	1
mortal	1
life	1
betray.	1
The	1
death	1
of	1
Jesus	1
set	1
me	1
free:	1
Then	1
what	1
have	1
I	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
thee?	1

Doubt	1

fled,	1
and	1
clouds	1

reason,	1
Dark	1

and	1
artful	1
teazing.	1
Folly	1
is	1
an	1
endless	1
maze;	1
Tangled	1
roots	1
perplex	1
her	1
ways;	1
How	1
many	1
have	1
fallen	1
there!	1
They	1
stumble	1
all	1
night	1
over	1
bones	1
of	1
the	1
dead;	1
And	1
feel	1
--	1
they	1
know	1
not	1
what	1
but	1
care;	1
And	1
wish	1
to	1
lead	1
others,	1
when	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
led.	1

All	1
but	1
the	1

in	1

sought	1
the	1
secret	1
air.	1
To	1

Down	1

Like	1

reflection	1

Like	1

Thou	1

She	1

O	1

little	1
virgin	1

Giving	1

But	1
Thel	1

Queen	1

And	1
why	1

Descend	1
O	1

Thel.	1
The	1
Cloud	1
descended	1

O	1
little	1
Cloud	1
the	1
virgin	1

I	1
charge	1
thee	1

me	1
Why	1
thou	1
complainest	1
now	1
when	1
in	1
one	1
hour	1
thou	1
fade	1
away:	1
Then	1
we	1
shall	1
seek	1
thee	1
but	1
not	1
find:	1
ah	1
Thel	1
is	1
like	1
to	1
thee.	1
I	1
pass	1
away,	1
yet	1
I	1
complain,	1
and	1
no	1
one	1
hears	1
my	1
voice.	1
The	1
Cloud	1
then	1
shewd	1
his	1
golden	1
head	1
&	1

bright	1
form	1
emerg'd.	1
Hovering	1
and	1
glittering	1
on	1
the	1
air	1
before	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
Thel.	1
O	1
virgin	1
know'st	1
thou	1
not	1
our	1
steeds	1
drink	1
of	1
the	1
golden	1
springs	1
Where	1
Luvah	1
doth	1
renew	1
his	1
horses:	1
lookst	1
thou	1
on	1
my	1
youth.	1
And	1
fearest	1
thou	1
because	1
I	1
vanish	1
and	1
am	1
seen	1
no	1
more.	1
Nothing	1
remains;	1
O	1
maid	1
I	1
tell	1
thee,	1
when	1
I	1
pass	1
away.	1
It	1
is	1
to	1
tenfold	1
life,	1
to	1
love,	1
to	1
peace,	1
and	1
raptures	1
holy:	1
Unseen	1
descending,	1
weigh	1
my	1
light	1
wings	1
upon	1
balmy	1
flowers:	1
And	1
court	1
the	1
fair	1
eyed	1
dew,	1
to	1
take	1
me	1
to	1
her	1
shining	1
tent	1
The	1
weeping	1
virgin,	1
trembling	1
kneels	1
before	1
the	1
risen	1
sun.	1
Till	1
we	1
arise	1
link'd	1
in	1
a	1
golden	1
band	1
and	1
never	1
part:	1
But	1
walk	1
united	1
bearing	1
food	1
to	1
all	1
our	1
tender	1
flowers.	1
Dost	1
thou	1
O	1
little	1
cloud?	1
I	1
fear	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
like	1
thee:	1
For	1
I	1
walk	1
through	1
the	1
vales	1
of	1
Har,	1
and	1
smell	1
the	1
sweetest	1
flowers:	1
But	1
I	1
feed	1
not	1
the	1
little	1
flowers:	1
I	1
hear	1
the	1
warbling	1
birds,	1
But	1
I	1
feed	1
not	1
the	1
warbling	1
birds,	1
they	1
fly	1
and	1
seek	1
their	1
food:	1
But	1
Thel	1
delights	1
in	1
these	1
no	1
more	1
because	1
I	1
fade	1
away	1
And	1
all	1
shall	1
say,	1
without	1
a	1
use	1
this	1
shining	1
women	1
liv'd,	1
Or	1
did	1
she	1
only	1
live	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
death	1
the	1
food	1
of	1
worms.	1
The	1
Cloud	1
reclind	1
upon	1
his	1
airy	1
throne	1
and	1
answerd	1
thus.	1
Then	1
if	1
thou	1
art	1
the	1
food	1
of	1
worms,	1
O	1
virgin	1
of	1
the	1
skies,	1
How	1
great	1
thy	1
use,	1
how	1
great	1
thy	1
blessing,	1
every	1
thing	1
that	1
lives.	1
Lives	1
not	1
alone	1
nor	1
or	1
itself:	1
fear	1
not	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
call,	1
The	1
weak	1
worm	1
from	1
its	1
lowly	1
bed,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
hear	1
its	1
voice.	1
Come	1
forth	1
worm	1
and	1
the	1
silent	1
valley,	1
to	1
thy	1
pensive	1
queen.	1
The	1
helpless	1
worm	1
arose	1
and	1
sat	1
upon	1
the	1
Lillys	1
leaf,	1
And	1
the	1
bright	1
Cloud	1
saild	1
on,	1
to	1
find	1
his	1
partner	1
in	1
the	1
vale.	1
III.	1
Then	1
Thel	1
astonish'd	1
view'd	1
the	1
Worm	1
upon	1
its	1
dewy	1
bed.	1
Art	1
thou	1
a	1
Worm?	1
image	1
of	1
weakness.	1
art	1
thou	1
but	1
a	1
Worm?	1
I	1
see	1
thee	1
like	1
an	1
infant	1
wrapped	1
in	1
the	1
Lillys	1
leaf;	1
Ah	1
weep	1
not	1
little	1
voice,	1
thou	1
can'st	1
not	1
speak,	1
but	1
thou	1
can'st	1
weep:	1
Is	1
this	1
a	1
Worm?	1
I	1
see	1
they	1
lay	1
helpless	1
&	1
naked:	1
weeping	1
And	1
none	1
to	1
answer,	1
none	1
to	1
cherish	1
thee	1
with	1
mothers	1
smiles.	1
The	1
Clod	1
of	1
Clay	1
heard	1
the	1
Worms	1
voice	1
&	1
rais'd	1
her	1
pitying	1
head:	1
She	1
bowd	1
over	1
the	1
weeping	1
infant,	1
and	1
her	1
life	1
exhald	1
In	1
milky	1
fondness,	1
then	1
on	1
Thel	1
she	1
fix'd	1
her	1
humble	1
eyes	1
O	1
beauty	1
of	1
the	1
vales	1
of	1
Har,	1
we	1
live	1
not	1
for	1
ourselves,	1
Thou	1
seest	1
me	1
the	1
meanest	1
thing,	1
and	1
so	1
I	1
am	1
indeed:	1
My	1
bosom	1
of	1
itself	1
is	1
cold,	1
and	1
of	1
itself	1
is	1
dark,	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
loves	1
the	1
lowly,	1
pours	1
his	1
oil	1
upon	1
my	1
head	1
And	1
kisses	1
me,	1
and	1
binds	1
his	1
nuptial	1
bands	1
around	1
my	1
breast.	1
And	1
says;	1
Thou	1
mother	1
of	1
my	1
children,	1
I	1
have	1
loved	1
thee	1
And	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
thee	1
a	1
crown	1
that	1
none	1
can	1
take	1
away.	1
But	1
how	1
this	1
is	1
sweet	1
maid,	1
I	1
know	1
not,	1
and	1
I	1
cannot	1
know	1
I	1
ponder,	1
and	1
I	1
cannot	1
ponder;	1
yet	1
I	1
live	1
and	1
love.	1
The	1
daughter	1
of	1
beauty	1
wip'd	1
her	1
pitying	1
tears	1
with	1
her	1
white	1
veil,	1
And	1
said,	1
Alas!	1
I	1
knew	1
not	1
this,	1
and	1
therefore	1
did	1
I	1
weep:	1
That	1
God	1
would	1
love	1
a	1
Worm	1
I	1
knew,	1
and	1
punish	1
the	1
evil	1
foot	1
That	1
wilful	1
bruis'd	1
its	1
helpless	1
form:	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
cherish'd	1
it	1
With	1
milk	1
and	1
oil	1
I	1
never	1
knew,	1
and	1
therefore	1
did	1
I	1
weep,	1
And	1
I	1
complaind	1
in	1
the	1
mild	1
air,	1
because	1
I	1
fade	1
away.	1
And	1
lay	1
me	1
down	1
in	1
thy	1
cold	1
bed,	1
and	1
leave	1
my	1
shining	1
lot.	1
Queen	1
of	1
the	1
vales,	1
the	1
matron	1
Clay	1
answered:	1
I	1
heard	1
thy	1
sighs.	1
And	1
all	1
thy	1
moans	1
flew	1
o'er	1
my	1
roof,	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
call'd	1
them	1
down:	1
Wilt	1
thou	1
O	1
Queen	1
enter	1
my	1
house,	1
tis	1
given	1
thee	1
to	1
enter,	1
And	1
to	1
return:	1
fear	1
nothing,	1
enter	1
with	1
thy	1
virgin	1
feet.	1
IV.	1
The	1
eternal	1
gates	1
terrific	1
porter	1
lifted	1
the	1
northern	1
bar:	1
Thel	1
enter'd	1
in	1
&	1
saw	1
the	1
secrets	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
unknown;	1
She	1
saw	1
the	1
couches	1
of	1
the	1
dead,	1
&	1
where	1
the	1
fibrous	1
roots	1
Of	1
every	1
heart	1
on	1
earth	1
infixes	1
deep	1
its	1
restless	1
twists:	1
A	1
land	1
of	1
sorrows	1
&	1
of	1
tears	1
where	1
never	1
smile	1
was	1
seen.	1
She	1
wandered	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
clouds	1
thro'	1
valleys	1
dark,	1
listning	1
Dolors	1
&	1
lamentations:	1
waiting	1
oft	1
beside	1
the	1
dewy	1
grave	1
She	1
stood	1
in	1
silence,	1
listning	1
to	1
the	1
voices	1
of	1
the	1
ground,	1
Till	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
grave	1
plot	1
she	1
came,	1
&	1
there	1
she	1
sat	1
down.	1
And	1
heard	1
this	1
voice	1
of	1
sorrow	1
breathed	1
from	1
the	1
hollow	1
pit.	1
Why	1
cannot	1
the	1
Ear	1
be	1
closed	1
to	1
its	1
own	1
destruction?	1
Or	1
the	1
glistening	1
Eye	1
to	1
the	1
poison	1
of	1
a	1
smile!	1
Why	1
are	1
Eyelids	1
stord	1
with	1
arrows	1
ready	1
drawn,	1
Where	1
a	1
thousand	1
fighting	1
men	1
in	1
ambush	1
lie!	1
Or	1
an	1
Eye	1
of	1
gifts	1
&	1
graces	1
showring	1
fruits	1
&	1
coined	1
gold!	1
Why	1
a	1
Tongue	1
impress'd	1
with	1
honey	1
from	1
every	1
wind?	1
Why	1
an	1
Ear,	1
a	1
whirlpool	1
fierce	1
to	1
draw	1
creations	1
in?	1
Why	1
a	1
Nostril	1
wide	1
inhaling	1
terror	1
trembling	1
&	1
affright	1
Why	1
a	1
tender	1
curb	1
upon	1
the	1
youthful	1
burning	1
boy?	1
Why	1
a	1
little	1
curtain	1
of	1
flesh	1
on	1
the	1
bed	1
of	1
our	1
desire?	1
The	1
Virgin	1
started	1
from	1
her	1
seat,	1
&	1
with	1
a	1
shriek,	1
Fled	1
back	1
unhinderd	1
till	1
she	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
vales	1
of	1
Har	1
