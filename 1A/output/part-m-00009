I.	1
The	1
Absence	1
of	1
Mr	1
Glass	1
THE	1
consulting-rooms	1
of	1
Dr	1
Orion	1
Hood,	1
the	1
eminent	1
criminologist	1
and	1
specialist	1
in	1
certain	1
moral	1
disorders,	1
lay	1
along	1
the	1
sea-front	1
at	1
Scarborough,	1
in	1
a	1
series	1
of	1
very	1
large	1
and	1
well-lighted	1
french	1
windows,	1
which	1
showed	1
the	1
North	1
Sea	1
like	1
one	1
endless	1
outer	1
wall	1
of	1
blue-green	1
marble.	1
In	1
such	1
a	1
place	1
the	1
sea	1
had	1
something	1
of	1
the	1
monotony	1
of	1
a	1
blue-green	1
dado:	1
for	1
the	1
chambers	1
themselves	1
were	1
ruled	1
throughout	1
by	1
a	1
terrible	1
tidiness	1
not	1
unlike	1
the	1
terrible	1
tidiness	1
of	1
the	1
sea.	1
It	1
must	1
not	1
be	1
supposed	1
that	1
Dr	1
Hood's	1
apartments	1
excluded	1
luxury,	1
or	1
even	1
poetry.	1
These	1
things	1
were	1
there,	1
in	1
their	1
place;	1
but	1
one	1
felt	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
never	1
allowed	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
place.	1
Luxury	1
was	1
there:	1
there	1
stood	1
upon	1
a	1
special	1
table	1
eight	1
or	1
ten	1
boxes	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
cigars;	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
built	1
upon	1
a	1
plan	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
strongest	1
were	1
always	1
nearest	1
the	1
wall	1
and	1
the	1
mildest	1
nearest	1
the	1
window.	1
A	1
tantalus	1
containing	1
three	1
kinds	1
of	1
spirit,	1
all	1
of	1
a	1
liqueur	1
excellence,	1
stood	1
always	1
on	1
this	1
table	1
of	1
luxury;	1
but	1
the	1
fanciful	1
have	1
asserted	1
that	1
the	1
whisky,	1
brandy,	1
and	1
rum	1
seemed	1
always	1
to	1
stand	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
level.	1
Poetry	1
was	1
there:	1
the	1
left-hand	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
was	1
lined	1
with	1
as	1
complete	1
a	1
set	1
of	1
English	1
classics	1
as	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
could	1
show	1
of	1
English	1
and	1
foreign	1
physiologists.	1
But	1
if	1
one	1
took	1
a	1
volume	1
of	1
Chaucer	1
or	1
Shelley	1
from	1
that	1
rank,	1
its	1
absence	1
irritated	1
the	1
mind	1
like	1
a	1
gap	1
in	1
a	1
man's	1
front	1
teeth.	1
One	1
could	1
not	1
say	1
the	1
books	1
were	1
never	1
read;	1
probably	1
they	1
were,	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
their	1
being	1
chained	1
to	1
their	1
places,	1
like	1
the	1
Bibles	1
in	1
the	1
old	1
churches.	1
Dr	1
Hood	1
treated	1
his	1
private	1
book-shelf	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
public	1
library.	1
And	1
if	1
this	1
strict	1
scientific	1
intangibility	1
steeped	1
even	1
the	1
shelves	1
laden	1
with	1
lyrics	1
and	1
ballads	1
and	1
the	1
tables	1
laden	1
with	1
drink	1
and	1
tobacco,	1
it	1
goes	1
without	1
saying	1
that	1
yet	1
more	1
of	1
such	1
heathen	1
holiness	1
protected	1
the	1
other	1
shelves	1
that	1
held	1
the	1
specialist's	1
library,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
tables	1
that	1
sustained	1
the	1
frail	1
and	1
even	1
fairylike	1
instruments	1
of	1
chemistry	1
or	1
mechanics.	1
Dr	1
Hood	1
paced	1
the	1
length	1
of	1
his	1
string	1
of	1
apartments,	1
bounded--	1
as	1
the	1
boys'	1
geographies	1
say--on	1
the	1
east	1
by	1
the	1
North	1
Sea	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
west	1
by	1
the	1
serried	1
ranks	1
of	1
his	1
sociological	1
and	1
criminologist	1
library.	1
He	1
was	1
clad	1
in	1
an	1
artist's	1
velvet,	1
but	1
with	1
none	1
of	1
an	1
artist's	1
negligence;	1
his	1
hair	1
was	1
heavily	1
shot	1
with	1
grey,	1
but	1
growing	1
thick	1
and	1
healthy;	1
his	1
face	1
was	1
lean,	1
but	1
sanguine	1
and	1
expectant.	1
Everything	1
about	1
him	1
and	1
his	1
room	1
indicated	1
something	1
at	1
once	1
rigid	1
and	1
restless,	1
like	1
that	1
great	1
northern	1
sea	1
by	1
which	1
(on	1
pure	1
principles	1
of	1
hygiene)	1
he	1
had	1
built	1
his	1
home.	1
Fate,	1
being	1
in	1
a	1
funny	1
mood,	1
pushed	1
the	1
door	1
open	1
and	1
introduced	1
into	1
those	1
long,	1
strict,	1
sea-flanked	1
apartments	1
one	1
who	1
was	1
perhaps	1
the	1
most	1
startling	1
opposite	1
of	1
them	1
and	1
their	1
master.	1
In	1
answer	1
to	1
a	1
curt	1
but	1
civil	1
summons,	1
the	1
door	1
opened	1
inwards	1
and	1
there	1
shambled	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
a	1
shapeless	1
little	1
figure,	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
find	1
its	1
own	1
hat	1
and	1
umbrella	1
as	1
unmanageable	1
as	1
a	1
mass	1
of	1
luggage.	1
The	1
umbrella	1
was	1
a	1
black	1
and	1
prosaic	1
bundle	1
long	1
past	1
repair;	1
the	1
hat	1
was	1
a	1
broad-curved	1
black	1
hat,	1
clerical	1
but	1
not	1
common	1
in	1
England;	1
the	1
man	1
was	1
the	1
very	1
embodiment	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
homely	1
and	1
helpless.	1
The	1
doctor	1
regarded	1
the	1
new-comer	1
with	1
a	1
restrained	1
astonishment,	1
not	1
unlike	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
shown	1
if	1
some	1
huge	1
but	1
obviously	1
harmless	1
sea-beast	1
had	1
crawled	1
into	1
his	1
room.	1
The	1
new-comer	1
regarded	1
the	1
doctor	1
with	1
that	1
beaming	1
but	1
breathless	1
geniality	1
which	1
characterizes	1
a	1
corpulent	1
charwoman	1
who	1
has	1
just	1
managed	1
to	1
stuff	1
herself	1
into	1
an	1
omnibus.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
rich	1
confusion	1
of	1
social	1
self-congratulation	1
and	1
bodily	1
disarray.	1
His	1
hat	1
tumbled	1
to	1
the	1
carpet,	1
his	1
heavy	1
umbrella	1
slipped	1
between	1
his	1
knees	1
with	1
a	1
thud;	1
he	1
reached	1
after	1
the	1
one	1
and	1
ducked	1
after	1
the	1
other,	1
but	1
with	1
an	1
unimpaired	1
smile	1
on	1
his	1
round	1
face	1
spoke	1
simultaneously	1
as	1
follows:	1
"My	1
name	1
is	1
Brown.	1
Pray	1
excuse	1
me.	1
I've	1
come	1
about	1
that	1
business	1
of	1
the	1
MacNabs.	1
I	1
have	1
heard,	1
you	1
often	1
help	1
people	1
out	1
of	1
such	1
troubles.	1
Pray	1
excuse	1
me	1
if	1
I	1
am	1
wrong."	1
By	1
this	1
time	1
he	1
had	1
sprawlingly	1
recovered	1
the	1
hat,	1
and	1
made	1
an	1
odd	1
little	1
bobbing	1
bow	1
over	1
it,	1
as	1
if	1
setting	1
everything	1
quite	1
right.	1
"I	1
hardly	1
understand	1
you,"	1
replied	1
the	1
scientist,	1
with	1
a	1
cold	1
intensity	1
of	1
manner.	1
"I	1
fear	1
you	1
have	1
mistaken	1
the	1
chambers.	1
I	1
am	1
Dr	1
Hood,	1
and	1
my	1
work	1
is	1
almost	1
entirely	1
literary	1
and	1
educational.	1
It	1
is	1
true	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
sometimes	1
been	1
consulted	1
by	1
the	1
police	1
in	1
cases	1
of	1
peculiar	1
difficulty	1
and	1
importance,	1
but--"	1
"Oh,	1
this	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
greatest	1
importance,"	1
broke	1
in	1
the	1
little	1
man	1
called	1
Brown.	1
"Why,	1
her	1
mother	1
won't	1
let	1
them	1
get	1
engaged."	1
And	1
he	1
leaned	1
back	1
in	1
his	1
chair	1
in	1
radiant	1
rationality.	1
The	1
brows	1
of	1
Dr	1
Hood	1
were	1
drawn	1
down	1
darkly,	1
but	1
the	1
eyes	1
under	1
them	1
were	1
bright	1
with	1
something	1
that	1
might	1
be	1
anger	1
or	1
might	1
be	1
amusement.	1
"And	1
still,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
quite	1
understand."	1
"You	1
see,	1
they	1
want	1
to	1
get	1
married,"	1
said	1
the	1
man	1
with	1
the	1
clerical	1
hat.	1
"Maggie	1
MacNab	1
and	1
young	1
Todhunter	1
want	1
to	1
get	1
married.	1
Now,	1
what	1
can	1
be	1
more	1
important	1
than	1
that?"	1
The	1
great	1
Orion	1
Hood's	1
scientific	1
triumphs	1
had	1
deprived	1
him	1
of	1
many	1
things--some	1
said	1
of	1
his	1
health,	1
others	1
of	1
his	1
God;	1
but	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
wholly	1
despoiled	1
him	1
of	1
his	1
sense	1
of	1
the	1
absurd.	1
At	1
the	1
last	1
plea	1
of	1
the	1
ingenuous	1
priest	1
a	1
chuckle	1
broke	1
out	1
of	1
him	1
from	1
inside,	1
and	1
he	1
threw	1
himself	1
into	1
an	1
arm-chair	1
in	1
an	1
ironical	1
attitude	1
of	1
the	1
consulting	1
physician.	1
"Mr	1
Brown,"	1
he	1
said	1
gravely,	1
"it	1
is	1
quite	1
fourteen	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
years	1
since	1
I	1
was	1
personally	1
asked	1
to	1
test	1
a	1
personal	1
problem:	1
then	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
an	1
attempt	1
to	1
poison	1
the	1
French	1
President	1
at	1
a	1
Lord	1
Mayor's	1
Banquet.	1
It	1
is	1
now,	1
I	1
understand,	1
a	1
question	1
of	1
whether	1
some	1
friend	1
of	1
yours	1
called	1
Maggie	1
is	1
a	1
suitable	1
fiancee	1
for	1
some	1
friend	1
of	1
hers	1
called	1
Todhunter.	1
Well,	1
Mr	1
Brown,	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
sportsman.	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
it	1
on.	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
the	1
MacNab	1
family	1
my	1
best	1
advice,	1
as	1
good	1
as	1
I	1
gave	1
the	1
French	1
Republic	1
and	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
England--no,	1
better:	1
fourteen	1
years	1
better.	1
I	1
have	1
nothing	1
else	1
to	1
do	1
this	1
afternoon.	1
Tell	1
me	1
your	1
story."	1
The	1
little	1
clergyman	1
called	1
Brown	1
thanked	1
him	1
with	1
unquestionable	1
warmth,	1
but	1
still	1
with	1
a	1
queer	1
kind	1
of	1
simplicity.	1
It	1
was	1
rather	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
thanking	1
a	1
stranger	1
in	1
a	1
smoking-room	1
for	1
some	1
trouble	1
in	1
passing	1
the	1
matches,	1
than	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
(as	1
he	1
was)	1
practically	1
thanking	1
the	1
Curator	1
of	1
Kew	1
Gardens	1
for	1
coming	1
with	1
him	1
into	1
a	1
field	1
to	1
find	1
a	1
four-leaved	1
clover.	1
With	1
scarcely	1
a	1
semi-colon	1
after	1
his	1
hearty	1
thanks,	1
the	1
little	1
man	1
began	1
his	1
recital:	1
"I	1
told	1
you	1
my	1
name	1
was	1
Brown;	1
well,	1
that's	1
the	1
fact,	1
and	1
I'm	1
the	1
priest	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
Catholic	1
Church	1
I	1
dare	1
say	1
you've	1
seen	1
beyond	1
those	1
straggly	1
streets,	1
where	1
the	1
town	1
ends	1
towards	1
the	1
north.	1
In	1
the	1
last	1
and	1
straggliest	1
of	1
those	1
streets	1
which	1
runs	1
along	1
the	1
sea	1
like	1
a	1
sea-wall	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
honest	1
but	1
rather	1
sharp-tempered	1
member	1
of	1
my	1
flock,	1
a	1
widow	1
called	1
MacNab.	1
She	1
has	1
one	1
daughter,	1
and	1
she	1
lets	1
lodgings,	1
and	1
between	1
her	1
and	1
the	1
daughter,	1
and	1
between	1
her	1
and	1
the	1
lodgers--well,	1
I	1
dare	1
say	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
to	1
be	1
said	1
on	1
both	1
sides.	1
At	1
present	1
she	1
has	1
only	1
one	1
lodger,	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
called	1
Todhunter;	1
but	1
he	1
has	1
given	1
more	1
trouble	1
than	1
all	1
the	1
rest,	1
for	1
he	1
wants	1
to	1
marry	1
the	1
young	1
woman	1
of	1
the	1
house."	1
"And	1
the	1
young	1
woman	1
of	1
the	1
house,"	1
asked	1
Dr	1
Hood,	1
with	1
huge	1
and	1
silent	1
amusement,	1
"what	1
does	1
she	1
want?"	1
"Why,	1
she	1
wants	1
to	1
marry	1
him,"	1
cried	1
Father	1
Brown,	1
sitting	1
up	1
eagerly.	1
"That	1
is	1
just	1
the	1
awful	1
complication."	1
"It	1
is	1
indeed	1
a	1
hideous	1
enigma,"	1
said	1
Dr	1
Hood.	1
"This	1
young	1
James	1
Todhunter,"	1
continued	1
the	1
cleric,	1
"is	1
a	1
very	1
decent	1
man	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
I	1
know;	1
but	1
then	1
nobody	1
knows	1
very	1
much.	1
He	1
is	1
a	1
bright,	1
brownish	1
little	1
fellow,	1
agile	1
like	1
a	1
monkey,	1
clean-shaven	1
like	1
an	1
actor,	1
and	1
obliging	1
like	1
a	1
born	1
courtier.	1
He	1
seems	1
to	1
have	1
quite	1
a	1
pocketful	1
of	1
money,	1
but	1
nobody	1
knows	1
what	1
his	1
trade	1
is.	1
Mrs	1
MacNab,	1
therefore	1
(being	1
of	1
a	1
pessimistic	1
turn),	1
is	1
quite	1
sure	1
it	1
is	1
something	1
dreadful,	1
and	1
probably	1
connected	1
with	1
dynamite.	1
The	1
dynamite	1
must	1
be	1
of	1
a	1
shy	1
and	1
noiseless	1
sort,	1
for	1
the	1
poor	1
fellow	1
only	1
shuts	1
himself	1
up	1
for	1
several	1
hours	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
and	1
studies	1
something	1
behind	1
a	1
locked	1
door.	1
He	1
declares	1
his	1
privacy	1
is	1
temporary	1
and	1
justified,	1
and	1
promises	1
to	1
explain	1
before	1
the	1
wedding.	1
That	1
is	1
all	1
that	1
anyone	1
knows	1
for	1
certain,	1
but	1
Mrs	1
MacNab	1
will	1
tell	1
you	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
more	1
than	1
even	1
she	1
is	1
certain	1
of.	1
You	1
know	1
how	1
the	1
tales	1
grow	1
like	1
grass	1
on	1
such	1
a	1
patch	1
of	1
ignorance	1
as	1
that.	1
There	1
are	1
tales	1
of	1
two	1
voices	1
heard	1
talking	1
in	1
the	1
room;	1
though,	1
when	1
the	1
door	1
is	1
opened,	1
Todhunter	1
is	1
always	1
found	1
alone.	1
There	1
are	1
tales	1
of	1
a	1
mysterious	1
tall	1
man	1
in	1
a	1
silk	1
hat,	1
who	1
once	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
sea-mists	1
and	1
apparently	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
stepping	1
softly	1
across	1
the	1
sandy	1
fields	1
and	1
through	1
the	1
small	1
back	1
garden	1
at	1
twilight,	1
till	1
he	1
was	1
heard	1
talking	1
to	1
the	1
lodger	1
at	1
his	1
open	1
window.	1
The	1
colloquy	1
seemed	1
to	1
end	1
in	1
a	1
quarrel.	1
Todhunter	1
dashed	1
down	1
his	1
window	1
with	1
violence,	1
and	1
the	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
high	1
hat	1
melted	1
into	1
the	1
sea-fog	1
again.	1
This	1
story	1
is	1
told	1
by	1
the	1
family	1
with	1
the	1
fiercest	1
mystification;	1
but	1
I	1
really	1
think	1
Mrs	1
MacNab	1
prefers	1
her	1
own	1
original	1
tale:	1
that	1
the	1
Other	1
Man	1
(or	1
whatever	1
it	1
is)	1
crawls	1
out	1
every	1
night	1
from	1
the	1
big	1
box	1
in	1
the	1
corner,	1
which	1
is	1
kept	1
locked	1
all	1
day.	1
You	1
see,	1
therefore,	1
how	1
this	1
sealed	1
door	1
of	1
Todhunter's	1
is	1
treated	1
as	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
fancies	1
and	1
monstrosities	1
of	1
the	1
`Thousand	1
and	1
One	1
Nights'.	1
And	1
yet	1
there	1
is	1
the	1
little	1
fellow	1
in	1
his	1
respectable	1
black	1
jacket,	1
as	1
punctual	1
and	1
innocent	1
as	1
a	1
parlour	1
clock.	1
He	1
pays	1
his	1
rent	1
to	1
the	1
tick;	1
he	1
is	1
practically	1
a	1
teetotaller;	1
he	1
is	1
tirelessly	1
kind	1
with	1
the	1
younger	1
children,	1
and	1
can	1
keep	1
them	1
amused	1
for	1
a	1
day	1
on	1
end;	1
and,	1
last	1
and	1
most	1
urgent	1
of	1
all,	1
he	1
has	1
made	1
himself	1
equally	1
popular	1
with	1
the	1
eldest	1
daughter,	1
who	1
is	1
ready	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
church	1
with	1
him	1
tomorrow."	1
A	1
man	1
warmly	1
concerned	1
with	1
any	1
large	1
theories	1
has	1
always	1
a	1
relish	1
for	1
applying	1
them	1
to	1
any	1
triviality.	1
The	1
great	1
specialist	1
having	1
condescended	1
to	1
the	1
priest's	1
simplicity,	1
condescended	1
expansively.	1
He	1
settled	1
himself	1
with	1
comfort	1
in	1
his	1
arm-chair	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
talk	1
in	1
the	1
tone	1
of	1
a	1
somewhat	1
absent-minded	1
lecturer:	1
"Even	1
in	1
a	1
minute	1
instance,	1
it	1
is	1
best	1
to	1
look	1
first	1
to	1
the	1
main	1
tendencies	1
of	1
Nature.	1
A	1
particular	1
flower	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
dead	1
in	1
early	1
winter,	1
but	1
the	1
flowers	1
are	1
dying;	1
a	1
particular	1
pebble	1
may	1
never	1
be	1
wetted	1
with	1
the	1
tide,	1
but	1
the	1
tide	1
is	1
coming	1
in.	1
To	1
the	1
scientific	1
eye	1
all	1
human	1
history	1
is	1
a	1
series	1
of	1
collective	1
movements,	1
destructions	1
or	1
migrations,	1
like	1
the	1
massacre	1
of	1
flies	1
in	1
winter	1
or	1
the	1
return	1
of	1
birds	1
in	1
spring.	1
Now	1
the	1
root	1
fact	1
in	1
all	1
history	1
is	1
Race.	1
Race	1
produces	1
religion;	1
Race	1
produces	1
legal	1
and	1
ethical	1
wars.	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
stronger	1
case	1
than	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
wild,	1
unworldly	1
and	1
perishing	1
stock	1
which	1
we	1
commonly	1
call	1
the	1
Celts,	1
of	1
whom	1
your	1
friends	1
the	1
MacNabs	1
are	1
specimens.	1
Small,	1
swarthy,	1
and	1
of	1
this	1
dreamy	1
and	1
drifting	1
blood,	1
they	1
accept	1
easily	1
the	1
superstitious	1
explanation	1
of	1
any	1
incidents,	1
just	1
as	1
they	1
still	1
accept	1
(you	1
will	1
excuse	1
me	1
for	1
saying)	1
that	1
superstitious	1
explanation	1
of	1
all	1
incidents	1
which	1
you	1
and	1
your	1
Church	1
represent.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
remarkable	1
that	1
such	1
people,	1
with	1
the	1
sea	1
moaning	1
behind	1
them	1
and	1
the	1
Church	1
(excuse	1
me	1
again)	1
droning	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
them,	1
should	1
put	1
fantastic	1
features	1
into	1
what	1
are	1
probably	1
plain	1
events.	1
You,	1
with	1
your	1
small	1
parochial	1
responsibilities,	1
see	1
only	1
this	1
particular	1
Mrs	1
MacNab,	1
terrified	1
with	1
this	1
particular	1
tale	1
of	1
two	1
voices	1
and	1
a	1
tall	1
man	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
sea.	1
But	1
the	1
man	1
with	1
the	1
scientific	1
imagination	1
sees,	1
as	1
it	1
were,	1
the	1
whole	1
clans	1
of	1
MacNab	1
scattered	1
over	1
the	1
whole	1
world,	1
in	1
its	1
ultimate	1
average	1
as	1
uniform	1
as	1
a	1
tribe	1
of	1
birds.	1
He	1
sees	1
thousands	1
of	1
Mrs	1
MacNabs,	1
in	1
thousands	1
of	1
houses,	1
dropping	1
their	1
little	1
drop	1
of	1
morbidity	1
in	1
the	1
tea-cups	1
of	1
their	1
friends;	1
he	1
sees--"	1
Before	1
the	1
scientist	1
could	1
conclude	1
his	1
sentence,	1
another	1
and	1
more	1
impatient	1
summons	1
sounded	1
from	1
without;	1
someone	1
with	1
swishing	1
skirts	1
was	1
marshalled	1
hurriedly	1
down	1
the	1
corridor,	1
and	1
the	1
door	1
opened	1
on	1
a	1
young	1
girl,	1
decently	1
dressed	1
but	1
disordered	1
and	1
red-hot	1
with	1
haste.	1
She	1
had	1
sea-blown	1
blonde	1
hair,	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
entirely	1
beautiful	1
if	1
her	1
cheek-bones	1
had	1
not	1
been,	1
in	1
the	1
Scotch	1
manner,	1
a	1
little	1
high	1
in	1
relief	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
in	1
colour.	1
Her	1
apology	1
was	1
almost	1
as	1
abrupt	1
as	1
a	1
command.	1
"I'm	1
sorry	1
to	1
interrupt	1
you,	1
sir,"	1
she	1
said,	1
"but	1
I	1
had	1
to	1
follow	1
Father	1
Brown	1
at	1
once;	1
it's	1
nothing	1
less	1
than	1
life	1
or	1
death."	1
Father	1
Brown	1
began	1
to	1
get	1
to	1
his	1
feet	1
in	1
some	1
disorder.	1
"Why,	1
what	1
has	1
happened,	1
Maggie?"	1
he	1
said.	1
"James	1
has	1
been	1
murdered,	1
for	1
all	1
I	1
can	1
make	1
out,"	1
answered	1
the	1
girl,	1
still	1
breathing	1
hard	1
from	1
her	1
rush.	1
"That	1
man	1
Glass	1
has	1
been	1
with	1
him	1
again;	1
I	1
heard	1
them	1
talking	1
through	1
the	1
door	1
quite	1
plain.	1
Two	1
separate	1
voices:	1
for	1
James	1
speaks	1
low,	1
with	1
a	1
burr,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
voice	1
was	1
high	1
and	1
quavery."	1
"That	1
man	1
Glass?"	1
repeated	1
the	1
priest	1
in	1
some	1
perplexity.	1
"I	1
know	1
his	1
name	1
is	1
Glass,"	1
answered	1
the	1
girl,	1
in	1
great	1
impatience.	1
"I	1
heard	1
it	1
through	1
the	1
door.	1
They	1
were	1
quarrelling--about	1
money,	1
I	1
think--for	1
I	1
heard	1
James	1
say	1
again	1
and	1
again,	1
`That's	1
right,	1
Mr	1
Glass,'	1
or	1
`No,	1
Mr	1
Glass,'	1
and	1
then,	1
`Two	1
or	1
three,	1
Mr	1
Glass.'	1
But	1
we're	1
talking	1
too	1
much;	1
you	1
must	1
come	1
at	1
once,	1
and	1
there	1
may	1
be	1
time	1
yet."	1
"But	1
time	1
for	1
what?"	1
asked	1
Dr	1
Hood,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
studying	1
the	1
young	1
lady	1
with	1
marked	1
interest.	1
"What	1
is	1
there	1
about	1
Mr	1
Glass	1
and	1
his	1
money	1
troubles	1
that	1
should	1
impel	1
such	1
urgency?"	1
"I	1
tried	1
to	1
break	1
down	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
couldn't,"	1
answered	1
the	1
girl	1
shortly,	1
"Then	1
I	1
ran	1
to	1
the	1
back-yard,	1
and	1
managed	1
to	1
climb	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
window-sill	1
that	1
looks	1
into	1
the	1
room.	1
It	1
was	1
an	1
dim,	1
and	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
empty,	1
but	1
I	1
swear	1
I	1
saw	1
James	1
lying	1
huddled	1
up	1
in	1
a	1
corner,	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
drugged	1
or	1
strangled."	1
"This	1
is	1
very	1
serious,"	1
said	1
Father	1
Brown,	1
gathering	1
his	1
errant	1
hat	1
and	1
umbrella	1
and	1
standing	1
up;	1
"in	1
point	1
of	1
fact	1
I	1
was	1
just	1
putting	1
your	1
case	1
before	1
this	1
gentleman,	1
and	1
his	1
view--"	1
"Has	1
been	1
largely	1
altered,"	1
said	1
the	1
scientist	1
gravely.	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
this	1
young	1
lady	1
is	1
so	1
Celtic	1
as	1
I	1
had	1
supposed.	1
As	1
I	1
have	1
nothing	1
else	1
to	1
do,	1
I	1
will	1
put	1
on	1
my	1
hat	1
and	1
stroll	1
down	1
town	1
with	1
you."	1
In	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
all	1
three	1
were	1
approaching	1
the	1
dreary	1
tail	1
of	1
the	1
MacNabs'	1
street:	1
the	1
girl	1
with	1
the	1
stern	1
and	1
breathless	1
stride	1
of	1
the	1
mountaineer,	1
the	1
criminologist	1
with	1
a	1
lounging	1
grace	1
(which	1
was	1
not	1
without	1
a	1
certain	1
leopard-like	1
swiftness),	1
and	1
the	1
priest	1
at	1
an	1
energetic	1
trot	1
entirely	1
devoid	1
of	1
distinction.	1
The	1
aspect	1
of	1
this	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
town	1
was	1
not	1
entirely	1
without	1
justification	1
for	1
the	1
doctor's	1
hints	1
about	1
desolate	1
moods	1
and	1
environments.	1
The	1
scattered	1
houses	1
stood	1
farther	1
and	1
farther	1
apart	1
in	1
a	1
broken	1
string	1
along	1
the	1
seashore;	1
the	1
afternoon	1
was	1
closing	1
with	1
a	1
premature	1
and	1
partly	1
lurid	1
twilight;	1
the	1
sea	1
was	1
of	1
an	1
inky	1
purple	1
and	1
murmuring	1
ominously.	1
In	1
the	1
scrappy	1
back	1
garden	1
of	1
the	1
MacNabs	1
which	1
ran	1
down	1
towards	1
the	1
sand,	1
two	1
black,	1
barren-looking	1
trees	1
stood	1
up	1
like	1
demon	1
hands	1
held	1
up	1
in	1
astonishment,	1
and	1
as	1
Mrs	1
MacNab	1
ran	1
down	1
the	1
street	1
to	1
meet	1
them	1
with	1
lean	1
hands	1
similarly	1
spread,	1
and	1
her	1
fierce	1
face	1
in	1
shadow,	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
like	1
a	1
demon	1
herself.	1
The	1
doctor	1
and	1
the	1
priest	1
made	1
scant	1
reply	1
to	1
her	1
shrill	1
reiterations	1
of	1
her	1
daughter's	1
story,	1
with	1
more	1
disturbing	1
details	1
of	1
her	1
own,	1
to	1
the	1
divided	1
vows	1
of	1
vengeance	1
against	1
Mr	1
Glass	1
for	1
murdering,	1
and	1
against	1
Mr	1
Todhunter	1
for	1
being	1
murdered,	1
or	1
against	1
the	1
latter	1
for	1
having	1
dared	1
to	1
want	1
to	1
marry	1
her	1
daughter,	1
and	1
for	1
not	1
having	1
lived	1
to	1
do	1
it.	1
They	1
passed	1
through	1
the	1
narrow	1
passage	1
in	1
the	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
until	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
lodger's	1
door	1
at	1
the	1
back,	1
and	1
there	1
Dr	1
Hood,	1
with	1
the	1
trick	1
of	1
an	1
old	1
detective,	1
put	1
his	1
shoulder	1
sharply	1
to	1
the	1
panel	1
and	1
burst	1
in	1
the	1
door.	1
It	1
opened	1
on	1
a	1
scene	1
of	1
silent	1
catastrophe.	1
No	1
one	1
seeing	1
it,	1
even	1
for	1
a	1
flash,	1
could	1
doubt	1
that	1
the	1
room	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
theatre	1
of	1
some	1
thrilling	1
collision	1
between	1
two,	1
or	1
perhaps	1
more,	1
persons.	1
Playing-cards	1
lay	1
littered	1
across	1
the	1
table	1
or	1
fluttered	1
about	1
the	1
floor	1
as	1
if	1
a	1
game	1
had	1
been	1
interrupted.	1
Two	1
wine	1
glasses	1
stood	1
ready	1
for	1
wine	1
on	1
a	1
side-table,	1
but	1
a	1
third	1
lay	1
smashed	1
in	1
a	1
star	1
of	1
crystal	1
upon	1
the	1
carpet.	1
A	1
few	1
feet	1
from	1
it	1
lay	1
what	1
looked	1
like	1
a	1
long	1
knife	1
or	1
short	1
sword,	1
straight,	1
but	1
with	1
an	1
ornamental	1
and	1
pictured	1
handle,	1
its	1
dull	1
blade	1
just	1
caught	1
a	1
grey	1
glint	1
from	1
the	1
dreary	1
window	1
behind,	1
which	1
showed	1
the	1
black	1
trees	1
against	1
the	1
leaden	1
level	1
of	1
the	1
sea.	1
Towards	1
the	1
opposite	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
was	1
rolled	1
a	1
gentleman's	1
silk	1
top	1
hat,	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
just	1
been	1
knocked	1
off	1
his	1
head;	1
so	1
much	1
so,	1
indeed,	1
that	1
one	1
almost	1
looked	1
to	1
see	1
it	1
still	1
rolling.	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
corner	1
behind	1
it,	1
thrown	1
like	1
a	1
sack	1
of	1
potatoes,	1
but	1
corded	1
like	1
a	1
railway	1
trunk,	1
lay	1
Mr	1
James	1
Todhunter,	1
with	1
a	1
scarf	1
across	1
his	1
mouth,	1
and	1
six	1
or	1
seven	1
ropes	1
knotted	1
round	1
his	1
elbows	1
and	1
ankles.	1
His	1
brown	1
eyes	1
were	1
alive	1
and	1
shifted	1
alertly.	1
Dr	1
Orion	1
Hood	1
paused	1
for	1
one	1
instant	1
on	1
the	1
doormat	1
and	1
drank	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
scene	1
of	1
voiceless	1
violence.	1
Then	1
he	1
stepped	1
swiftly	1
across	1
the	1
carpet,	1
picked	1
up	1
the	1
tall	1
silk	1
hat,	1
and	1
gravely	1
put	1
it	1
upon	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
yet	1
pinioned	1
Todhunter.	1
It	1
was	1
so	1
much	1
too	1
large	1
for	1
him	1
that	1
it	1
almost	1
slipped	1
down	1
on	1
to	1
his	1
shoulders.	1
"Mr	1
Glass's	1
hat,"	1
said	1
the	1
doctor,	1
returning	1
with	1
it	1
and	1
peering	1
into	1
the	1
inside	1
with	1
a	1
pocket	1
lens.	1
"How	1
to	1
explain	1
the	1
absence	1
of	1
Mr	1
Glass	1
and	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
Mr	1
Glass's	1
hat?	1
For	1
Mr	1
Glass	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
careless	1
man	1
with	1
his	1
clothes.	1
That	1
hat	1
is	1
of	1
a	1
stylish	1
shape	1
and	1
systematically	1
brushed	1
and	1
burnished,	1
though	1
not	1
very	1
new.	1
An	1
old	1
dandy,	1
I	1
should	1
think."	1
"But,	1
good	1
heavens!"	1
called	1
out	1
Miss	1
MacNab,	1
"aren't	1
you	1
going	1
to	1
untie	1
the	1
man	1
first?"	1
"I	1
say	1
`old'	1
with	1
intention,	1
though	1
not	1
with	1
certainty"	1
continued	1
the	1
expositor;	1
"my	1
reason	1
for	1
it	1
might	1
seem	1
a	1
little	1
far-fetched.	1
The	1
hair	1
of	1
human	1
beings	1
falls	1
out	1
in	1
very	1
varying	1
degrees,	1
but	1
almost	1
always	1
falls	1
out	1
slightly,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
lens	1
I	1
should	1
see	1
the	1
tiny	1
hairs	1
in	1
a	1
hat	1
recently	1
worn.	1
It	1
has	1
none,	1
which	1
leads	1
me	1
to	1
guess	1
that	1
Mr	1
Glass	1
is	1
bald.	1
Now	1
when	1
this	1
is	1
taken	1
with	1
the	1
high-pitched	1
and	1
querulous	1
voice	1
which	1
Miss	1
MacNab	1
described	1
so	1
vividly	1
(patience,	1
my	1
dear	1
lady,	1
patience),	1
when	1
we	1
take	1
the	1
hairless	1
head	1
together	1
with	1
the	1
tone	1
common	1
in	1
senile	1
anger,	1
I	1
should	1
think	1
we	1
may	1
deduce	1
some	1
advance	1
in	1
years.	1
Nevertheless,	1
he	1
was	1
probably	1
vigorous,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
almost	1
certainly	1
tall.	1
I	1
might	1
rely	1
in	1
some	1
degree	1
on	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
his	1
previous	1
appearance	1
at	1
the	1
window,	1
as	1
a	1
tall	1
man	1
in	1
a	1
silk	1
hat,	1
but	1
I	1
think	1
I	1
have	1
more	1
exact	1
indication.	1
This	1
wineglass	1
has	1
been	1
smashed	1
all	1
over	1
the	1
place,	1
but	1
one	1
of	1
its	1
splinters	1
lies	1
on	1
the	1
high	1
bracket	1
beside	1
the	1
mantelpiece.	1
No	1
such	1
fragment	1
could	1
have	1
fallen	1
there	1
if	1
the	1
vessel	1
had	1
been	1
smashed	1
in	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
a	1
comparatively	1
short	1
man	1
like	1
Mr	1
Todhunter."	1
"By	1
the	1
way,"	1
said	1
Father	1
Brown,	1
"might	1
it	1
not	1
be	1
as	1
well	1
to	1
untie	1
Mr	1
Todhunter?"	1
"Our	1
lesson	1
from	1
the	1
drinking-vessels	1
does	1
not	1
end	1
here,"	1
proceeded	1
the	1
specialist.	1
"I	1
may	1
say	1
at	1
once	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
possible	1
that	1
the	1
man	1
Glass	1
was	1
bald	1
or	1
nervous	1
through	1
dissipation	1
rather	1
than	1
age.	1
Mr	1
Todhunter,	1
as	1
has	1
been	1
remarked,	1
is	1
a	1
quiet	1
thrifty	1
gentleman,	1
essentially	1
an	1
abstainer.	1
These	1
cards	1
and	1
wine-cups	1
are	1
no	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
normal	1
habit;	1
they	1
have	1
been	1
produced	1
for	1
a	1
particular	1
companion.	1
But,	1
as	1
it	1
happens,	1
we	1
may	1
go	1
farther.	1
Mr	1
Todhunter	1
may	1
or	1
may	1
not	1
possess	1
this	1
wine-service,	1
but	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
appearance	1
of	1
his	1
possessing	1
any	1
wine.	1
What,	1
then,	1
were	1
these	1
vessels	1
to	1
contain?	1
I	1
would	1
at	1
once	1
suggest	1
some	1
brandy	1
or	1
whisky,	1
perhaps	1
of	1
a	1
luxurious	1
sort,	1
from	1
a	1
flask	1
in	1
the	1
pocket	1
of	1
Mr	1
Glass.	1
We	1
have	1
thus	1
something	1
like	1
a	1
picture	1
of	1
the	1
man,	1
or	1
at	1
least	1
of	1
the	1
type:	1
tall,	1
elderly,	1
fashionable,	1
but	1
somewhat	1
frayed,	1
certainly	1
fond	1
of	1
play	1
and	1
strong	1
waters,	1
perhaps	1
rather	1
too	1
fond	1
of	1
them	1
Mr	1
Glass	1
is	1
a	1
gentleman	1
not	1
unknown	1
on	1
the	1
fringes	1
of	1
society."	1
"Look	1
here,"	1
cried	1
the	1
young	1
woman,	1
"if	1
you	1
don't	1
let	1
me	1
pass	1
to	1
untie	1
him	1
I'll	1
run	1
outside	1
and	1
scream	1
for	1
the	1
police."	1
"I	1
should	1
not	1
advise	1
you,	1
Miss	1
MacNab,"	1
said	1
Dr	1
Hood	1
gravely,	1
"to	1
be	1
in	1
any	1
hurry	1
to	1
fetch	1
the	1
police.	1
Father	1
Brown,	1
I	1
seriously	1
ask	1
you	1
to	1
compose	1
your	1
flock,	1
for	1
their	1
sakes,	1
not	1
for	1
mine.	1
Well,	1
we	1
have	1
seen	1
something	1
of	1
the	1
figure	1
and	1
quality	1
of	1
Mr	1
Glass;	1
what	1
are	1
the	1
chief	1
facts	1
known	1
of	1
Mr	1
Todhunter?	1
They	1
are	1
substantially	1
three:	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
economical,	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
more	1
or	1
less	1
wealthy,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
a	1
secret.	1
Now,	1
surely	1
it	1
is	1
obvious	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
the	1
three	1
chief	1
marks	1
of	1
the	1
kind	1
of	1
man	1
who	1
is	1
blackmailed.	1
And	1
surely	1
it	1
is	1
equally	1
obvious	1
that	1
the	1
faded	1
finery,	1
the	1
profligate	1
habits,	1
and	1
the	1
shrill	1
irritation	1
of	1
Mr	1
Glass	1
are	1
the	1
unmistakable	1
marks	1
of	1
the	1
kind	1
of	1
man	1
who	1
blackmails	1
him.	1
We	1
have	1
the	1
two	1
typical	1
figures	1
of	1
a	1
tragedy	1
of	1
hush	1
money:	1
on	1
the	1
one	1
hand,	1
the	1
respectable	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
mystery;	1
on	1
the	1
other,	1
the	1
West-end	1
vulture	1
with	1
a	1
scent	1
for	1
a	1
mystery.	1
These	1
two	1
men	1
have	1
met	1
here	1
today	1
and	1
have	1
quarrelled,	1
using	1
blows	1
and	1
a	1
bare	1
weapon."	1
"Are	1
you	1
going	1
to	1
take	1
those	1
ropes	1
off?"	1
asked	1
the	1
girl	1
stubbornly.	1
Dr	1
Hood	1
replaced	1
the	1
silk	1
hat	1
carefully	1
on	1
the	1
side	1
table,	1
and	1
went	1
across	1
to	1
the	1
captive.	1
He	1
studied	1
him	1
intently,	1
even	1
moving	1
him	1
a	1
little	1
and	1
half-turning	1
him	1
round	1
by	1
the	1
shoulders,	1
but	1
he	1
only	1
answered:	1
"No;	1
I	1
think	1
these	1
ropes	1
will	1
do	1
very	1
well	1
till	1
your	1
friends	1
the	1
police	1
bring	1
the	1
handcuffs."	1
Father	1
Brown,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
looking	1
dully	1
at	1
the	1
carpet,	1
lifted	1
his	1
round	1
face	1
and	1
said:	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
mean?"	1
The	1
man	1
of	1
science	1
had	1
picked	1
up	1
the	1
peculiar	1
dagger-sword	1
from	1
the	1
carpet	1
and	1
was	1
examining	1
it	1
intently	1
as	1
he	1
answered:	1
"Because	1
you	1
find	1
Mr	1
Todhunter	1
tied	1
up,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"you	1
all	1
jump	1
to	1
the	1
conclusion	1
that	1
Mr	1
Glass	1
had	1
tied	1
him	1
up;	1
and	1
then,	1
I	1
suppose,	1
escaped.	1
There	1
are	1
four	1
objections	1
to	1
this:	1
First,	1
why	1
should	1
a	1
gentleman	1
so	1
dressy	1
as	1
our	1
friend	1
Glass	1
leave	1
his	1
hat	1
behind	1
him,	1
if	1
he	1
left	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
free	1
will?	1
Second,"	1
he	1
continued,	1
moving	1
towards	1
the	1
window,	1
"this	1
is	1
the	1
only	1
exit,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
locked	1
on	1
the	1
inside.	1
Third,	1
this	1
blade	1
here	1
has	1
a	1
tiny	1
touch	1
of	1
blood	1
at	1
the	1
point,	1
but	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
wound	1
on	1
Mr	1
Todhunter.	1
Mr	1
Glass	1
took	1
that	1
wound	1
away	1
with	1
him,	1
dead	1
or	1
alive.	1
Add	1
to	1
all	1
this	1
primary	1
probability.	1
It	1
is	1
much	1
more	1
likely	1
that	1
the	1
blackmailed	1
person	1
would	1
try	1
to	1
kill	1
his	1
incubus,	1
rather	1
than	1
that	1
the	1
blackmailer	1
would	1
try	1
to	1
kill	1
the	1
goose	1
that	1
lays	1
his	1
golden	1
egg.	1
There,	1
I	1
think,	1
we	1
have	1
a	1
pretty	1
complete	1
story."	1
"But	1
the	1
ropes?"	1
inquired	1
the	1
priest,	1
whose	1
eyes	1
had	1
remained	1
open	1
with	1
a	1
rather	1
vacant	1
admiration.	1
"Ah,	1
the	1
ropes,"	1
said	1
the	1
expert	1
with	1
a	1
singular	1
intonation.	1
"Miss	1
MacNab	1
very	1
much	1
wanted	1
to	1
know	1
why	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
set	1
Mr	1
Todhunter	1
free	1
from	1
his	1
ropes.	1
Well,	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
her.	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
do	1
it	1
because	1
Mr	1
Todhunter	1
can	1
set	1
himself	1
free	1
from	1
them	1
at	1
any	1
minute	1
he	1
chooses."	1
"What?"	1
cried	1
the	1
audience	1
on	1
quite	1
different	1
notes	1
of	1
astonishment.	1
"I	1
have	1
looked	1
at	1
all	1
the	1
knots	1
on	1
Mr	1
Todhunter,"	1
reiterated	1
Hood	1
quietly.	1
"I	1
happen	1
to	1
know	1
something	1
about	1
knots;	1
they	1
are	1
quite	1
a	1
branch	1
of	1
criminal	1
science.	1
Every	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
knots	1
he	1
has	1
made	1
himself	1
and	1
could	1
loosen	1
himself;	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
made	1
by	1
an	1
enemy	1
really	1
trying	1
to	1
pinion	1
him.	1
The	1
whole	1
of	1
this	1
affair	1
of	1
the	1
ropes	1
is	1
a	1
clever	1
fake,	1
to	1
make	1
us	1
think	1
him	1
the	1
victim	1
of	1
the	1
struggle	1
instead	1
of	1
the	1
wretched	1
Glass,	1
whose	1
corpse	1
may	1
be	1
hidden	1
in	1
the	1
garden	1
or	1
stuffed	1
up	1
the	1
chimney."	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
rather	1
depressed	1
silence;	1
the	1
room	1
was	1
darkening,	1
the	1
sea-blighted	1
boughs	1
of	1
the	1
garden	1
trees	1
looked	1
leaner	1
and	1
blacker	1
than	1
ever,	1
yet	1
they	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
come	1
nearer	1
to	1
the	1
window.	1
One	1
could	1
almost	1
fancy	1
they	1
were	1
sea-monsters	1
like	1
krakens	1
or	1
cuttlefish,	1
writhing	1
polypi	1
who	1
had	1
crawled	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
sea	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
this	1
tragedy,	1
even	1
as	1
he,	1
the	1
villain	1
and	1
victim	1
of	1
it,	1
the	1
terrible	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
tall	1
hat,	1
had	1
once	1
crawled	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
sea.	1
For	1
the	1
whole	1
air	1
was	1
dense	1
with	1
the	1
morbidity	1
of	1
blackmail,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
most	1
morbid	1
of	1
human	1
things,	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
crime	1
concealing	1
a	1
crime;	1
a	1
black	1
plaster	1
on	1
a	1
blacker	1
wound.	1
The	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
Catholic	1
priest,	1
which	1
was	1
commonly	1
complacent	1
and	1
even	1
comic,	1
had	1
suddenly	1
become	1
knotted	1
with	1
a	1
curious	1
frown.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
blank	1
curiosity	1
of	1
his	1
first	1
innocence.	1
It	1
was	1
rather	1
that	1
creative	1
curiosity	1
which	1
comes	1
when	1
a	1
man	1
has	1
the	1
beginnings	1
of	1
an	1
idea.	1
"Say	1
it	1
again,	1
please,"	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
simple,	1
bothered	1
manner;	1
"do	1
you	1
mean	1
that	1
Todhunter	1
can	1
tie	1
himself	1
up	1
all	1
alone	1
and	1
untie	1
himself	1
all	1
alone?"	1
"That	1
is	1
what	1
I	1
mean,"	1
said	1
the	1
doctor.	1
"Jerusalem!"	1
ejaculated	1
Brown	1
suddenly,	1
"I	1
wonder	1
if	1
it	1
could	1
possibly	1
be	1
that!"	1
He	1
scuttled	1
across	1
the	1
room	1
rather	1
like	1
a	1
rabbit,	1
and	1
peered	1
with	1
quite	1
a	1
new	1
impulsiveness	1
into	1
the	1
partially-covered	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
captive.	1
Then	1
he	1
turned	1
his	1
own	1
rather	1
fatuous	1
face	1
to	1
the	1
company.	1
"Yes,	1
that's	1
it!"	1
he	1
cried	1
in	1
a	1
certain	1
excitement.	1
"Can't	1
you	1
see	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
man's	1
face?	1
Why,	1
look	1
at	1
his	1
eyes!"	1
Both	1
the	1
Professor	1
and	1
the	1
girl	1
followed	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
his	1
glance.	1
And	1
though	1
the	1
broad	1
black	1
scarf	1
completely	1
masked	1
the	1
lower	1
half	1
of	1
Todhunter's	1
visage,	1
they	1
did	1
grow	1
conscious	1
of	1
something	1
struggling	1
and	1
intense	1
about	1
the	1
upper	1
part	1
of	1
it.	1
"His	1
eyes	1
do	1
look	1
queer,"	1
cried	1
the	1
young	1
woman,	1
strongly	1
moved.	1
"You	1
brutes;	1
I	1
believe	1
it's	1
hurting	1
him!"	1
"Not	1
that,	1
I	1
think,"	1
said	1
Dr	1
Hood;	1
"the	1
eyes	1
have	1
certainly	1
a	1
singular	1
expression.	1
But	1
I	1
should	1
interpret	1
those	1
transverse	1
wrinkles	1
as	1
expressing	1
rather	1
such	1
slight	1
psychological	1
abnormality--"	1
"Oh,	1
bosh!"	1
cried	1
Father	1
Brown:	1
"can't	1
you	1
see	1
he's	1
laughing?"	1
"Laughing!"	1
repeated	1
the	1
doctor,	1
with	1
a	1
start;	1
"but	1
what	1
on	1
earth	1
can	1
he	1
be	1
laughing	1
at?"	1
"Well,"	1
replied	1
the	1
Reverend	1
Brown	1
apologetically,	1
"not	1
to	1
put	1
too	1
fine	1
a	1
point	1
on	1
it,	1
I	1
think	1
he	1
is	1
laughing	1
at	1
you.	1
And	1
indeed,	1
I'm	1
a	1
little	1
inclined	1
to	1
laugh	1
at	1
myself,	1
now	1
I	1
know	1
about	1
it."	1
"Now	1
you	1
know	1
about	1
what?"	1
asked	1
Hood,	1
in	1
some	1
exasperation.	1
"Now	1
I	1
know,"	1
replied	1
the	1
priest,	1
"the	1
profession	1
of	1
Mr	1
Todhunter."	1
He	1
shuffled	1
about	1
the	1
room,	1
looking	1
at	1
one	1
object	1
after	1
another	1
with	1
what	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
vacant	1
stare,	1
and	1
then	1
invariably	1
bursting	1
into	1
an	1
equally	1
vacant	1
laugh,	1
a	1
highly	1
irritating	1
process	1
for	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
to	1
watch	1
it.	1
He	1
laughed	1
very	1
much	1
over	1
the	1
hat,	1
still	1
more	1
uproariously	1
over	1
the	1
broken	1
glass,	1
but	1
the	1
blood	1
on	1
the	1
sword	1
point	1
sent	1
him	1
into	1
mortal	1
convulsions	1
of	1
amusement.	1
Then	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
fuming	1
specialist.	1
"Dr	1
Hood,"	1
he	1
cried	1
enthusiastically,	1
"you	1
are	1
a	1
great	1
poet!	1
You	1
have	1
called	1
an	1
uncreated	1
being	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
void.	1
How	1
much	1
more	1
godlike	1
that	1
is	1
than	1
if	1
you	1
had	1
only	1
ferreted	1
out	1
the	1
mere	1
facts!	1
Indeed,	1
the	1
mere	1
facts	1
are	1
rather	1
commonplace	1
and	1
comic	1
by	1
comparison."	1
"I	1
have	1
no	1
notion	1
what	1
you	1
are	1
talking	1
about,"	1
said	1
Dr	1
Hood	1
rather	1
haughtily;	1
"my	1
facts	1
are	1
all	1
inevitable,	1
though	1
necessarily	1
incomplete.	1
A	1
place	1
may	1
be	1
permitted	1
to	1
intuition,	1
perhaps	1
(or	1
poetry	1
if	1
you	1
prefer	1
the	1
term),	1
but	1
only	1
because	1
the	1
corresponding	1
details	1
cannot	1
as	1
yet	1
be	1
ascertained.	1
In	1
the	1
absence	1
of	1
Mr	1
Glass--"	1
"That's	1
it,	1
that's	1
it,"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
priest,	1
nodding	1
quite	1
eagerly,	1
"that's	1
the	1
first	1
idea	1
to	1
get	1
fixed;	1
the	1
absence	1
of	1
Mr	1
Glass.	1
He	1
is	1
so	1
extremely	1
absent.	1
I	1
suppose,"	1
he	1
added	1
reflectively,	1
"that	1
there	1
was	1
never	1
anybody	1
so	1
absent	1
as	1
Mr	1
Glass."	1
"Do	1
you	1
mean	1
he	1
is	1
absent	1
from	1
the	1
town?"	1
demanded	1
the	1
doctor.	1
"I	1
mean	1
he	1
is	1
absent	1
from	1
everywhere,"	1
answered	1
Father	1
Brown;	1
"he	1
is	1
absent	1
from	1
the	1
Nature	1
of	1
Things,	1
so	1
to	1
speak."	1
"Do	1
you	1
seriously	1
mean,"	1
said	1
the	1
specialist	1
with	1
a	1
smile,	1
"that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
such	1
person?"	1
The	1
priest	1
made	1
a	1
sign	1
of	1
assent.	1
"It	1
does	1
seem	1
a	1
pity,"	1
he	1
said.	1
Orion	1
Hood	1
broke	1
into	1
a	1
contemptuous	1
laugh.	1
"Well,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"before	1
we	1
go	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
hundred	1
and	1
one	1
other	1
evidences,	1
let	1
us	1
take	1
the	1
first	1
proof	1
we	1
found;	1
the	1
first	1
fact	1
we	1
fell	1
over	1
when	1
we	1
fell	1
into	1
this	1
room.	1
If	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
Mr	1
Glass,	1
whose	1
hat	1
is	1
this?"	1
"It	1
is	1
Mr	1
Todhunter's,"	1
replied	1
Father	1
Brown.	1
"But	1
it	1
doesn't	1
fit	1
him,"	1
cried	1
Hood	1
impatiently.	1
"He	1
couldn't	1
possibly	1
wear	1
it!"	1
Father	1
Brown	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
with	1
ineffable	1
mildness.	1
"I	1
never	1
said	1
he	1
could	1
wear	1
it,"	1
he	1
answered.	1
"I	1
said	1
it	1
was	1
his	1
hat.	1
Or,	1
if	1
you	1
insist	1
on	1
a	1
shade	1
of	1
difference,	1
a	1
hat	1
that	1
is	1
his."	1
"And	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
shade	1
of	1
difference?"	1
asked	1
the	1
criminologist	1
with	1
a	1
slight	1
sneer.	1
"My	1
good	1
sir,"	1
cried	1
the	1
mild	1
little	1
man,	1
with	1
his	1
first	1
movement	1
akin	1
to	1
impatience,	1
"if	1
you	1
will	1
walk	1
down	1
the	1
street	1
to	1
the	1
nearest	1
hatter's	1
shop,	1
you	1
will	1
see	1
that	1
there	1
is,	1
in	1
common	1
speech,	1
a	1
difference	1
between	1
a	1
man's	1
hat	1
and	1
the	1
hats	1
that	1
are	1
his."	1
"But	1
a	1
hatter,"	1
protested	1
Hood,	1
"can	1
get	1
money	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
stock	1
of	1
new	1
hats.	1
What	1
could	1
Todhunter	1
get	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
one	1
old	1
hat?"	1
"Rabbits,"	1
replied	1
Father	1
Brown	1
promptly.	1
"What?"	1
cried	1
Dr	1
Hood.	1
"Rabbits,	1
ribbons,	1
sweetmeats,	1
goldfish,	1
rolls	1
of	1
coloured	1
paper,"	1
said	1
the	1
reverend	1
gentleman	1
with	1
rapidity.	1
"Didn't	1
you	1
see	1
it	1
all	1
when	1
you	1
found	1
out	1
the	1
faked	1
ropes?	1
It's	1
just	1
the	1
same	1
with	1
the	1
sword.	1
Mr	1
Todhunter	1
hasn't	1
got	1
a	1
scratch	1
on	1
him,	1
as	1
you	1
say;	1
but	1
he's	1
got	1
a	1
scratch	1
in	1
him,	1
if	1
you	1
follow	1
me."	1
"Do	1
you	1
mean	1
inside	1
Mr	1
Todhunter's	1
clothes?"	1
inquired	1
Mrs	1
MacNab	1
sternly.	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
mean	1
inside	1
Mr	1
Todhunter's	1
clothes,"	1
said	1
Father	1
Brown.	1
"I	1
mean	1
inside	1
Mr	1
Todhunter."	1
"Well,	1
what	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Bedlam	1
do	1
you	1
mean?"	1
"Mr	1
Todhunter,"	1
explained	1
Father	1
Brown	1
placidly,	1
"is	1
learning	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
professional	1
conjurer,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
juggler,	1
ventriloquist,	1
and	1
expert	1
in	1
the	1
rope	1
trick.	1
The	1
conjuring	1
explains	1
the	1
hat.	1
It	1
is	1
without	1
traces	1
of	1
hair,	1
not	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
worn	1
by	1
the	1
prematurely	1
bald	1
Mr	1
Glass,	1
but	1
because	1
it	1
has	1
never	1
been	1
worn	1
by	1
anybody.	1
The	1
juggling	1
explains	1
the	1
three	1
glasses,	1
which	1
Todhunter	1
was	1
teaching	1
himself	1
to	1
throw	1
up	1
and	1
catch	1
in	1
rotation.	1
But,	1
being	1
only	1
at	1
the	1
stage	1
of	1
practice,	1
he	1
smashed	1
one	1
glass	1
against	1
the	1
ceiling.	1
And	1
the	1
juggling	1
also	1
explains	1
the	1
sword,	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
Mr	1
Todhunter's	1
professional	1
pride	1
and	1
duty	1
to	1
swallow.	1
But,	1
again,	1
being	1
at	1
the	1
stage	1
of	1
practice,	1
he	1
very	1
slightly	1
grazed	1
the	1
inside	1
of	1
his	1
throat	1
with	1
the	1
weapon.	1
Hence	1
he	1
has	1
a	1
wound	1
inside	1
him,	1
which	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
(from	1
the	1
expression	1
on	1
his	1
face)	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
serious	1
one.	1
He	1
was	1
also	1
practising	1
the	1
trick	1
of	1
a	1
release	1
from	1
ropes,	1
like	1
the	1
Davenport	1
Brothers,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
just	1
about	1
to	1
free	1
himself	1
when	1
we	1
all	1
burst	1
into	1
the	1
room.	1
The	1
cards,	1
of	1
course,	1
are	1
for	1
card	1
tricks,	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
scattered	1
on	1
the	1
floor	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
just	1
been	1
practising	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
dodges	1
of	1
sending	1
them	1
flying	1
through	1
the	1
air.	1
He	1
merely	1
kept	1
his	1
trade	1
secret,	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
keep	1
his	1
tricks	1
secret,	1
like	1
any	1
other	1
conjurer.	1
But	1
the	1
mere	1
fact	1
of	1
an	1
idler	1
in	1
a	1
top	1
hat	1
having	1
once	1
looked	1
in	1
at	1
his	1
back	1
window,	1
and	1
been	1
driven	1
away	1
by	1
him	1
with	1
great	1
indignation,	1
was	1
enough	1
to	1
set	1
us	1
all	1
on	1
a	1
wrong	1
track	1
of	1
romance,	1
and	1
make	1
us	1
imagine	1
his	1
whole	1
life	1
overshadowed	1
by	1
the	1
silk-hatted	1
spectre	1
of	1
Mr	1
Glass."	1
"But	1
What	1
about	1
the	1
two	1
voices?"	1
asked	1
Maggie,	1
staring.	1
"Have	1
you	1
never	1
heard	1
a	1
ventriloquist?"	1
asked	1
Father	1
Brown.	1
"Don't	1
you	1
know	1
they	1
speak	1
first	1
in	1
their	1
natural	1
voice,	1
and	1
then	1
answer	1
themselves	1
in	1
just	1
that	1
shrill,	1
squeaky,	1
unnatural	1
voice	1
that	1
you	1
heard?"	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
long	1
silence,	1
and	1
Dr	1
Hood	1
regarded	1
the	1
little	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
spoken	1
with	1
a	1
dark	1
and	1
attentive	1
smile.	1
"You	1
are	1
certainly	1
a	1
very	1
ingenious	1
person,"	1
he	1
said;	1
"it	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
done	1
better	1
in	1
a	1
book.	1
But	1
there	1
is	1
just	1
one	1
part	1
of	1
Mr	1
Glass	1
you	1
have	1
not	1
succeeded	1
in	1
explaining	1
away,	1
and	1
that	1
is	1
his	1
name.	1
Miss	1
MacNab	1
distinctly	1
heard	1
him	1
so	1
addressed	1
by	1
Mr	1
Todhunter."	1
The	1
Rev.	1
Mr	1
Brown	1
broke	1
into	1
a	1
rather	1
childish	1
giggle.	1
"Well,	1
that,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"that's	1
the	1
silliest	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
silly	1
story.	1
When	1
our	1
juggling	1
friend	1
here	1
threw	1
up	1
the	1
three	1
glasses	1
in	1
turn,	1
he	1
counted	1
them	1
aloud	1
as	1
he	1
caught	1
them,	1
and	1
also	1
commented	1
aloud	1
when	1
he	1
failed	1
to	1
catch	1
them.	1
What	1
he	1
really	1
said	1
was:	1
`One,	1
two	1
and	1
three--missed	1
a	1
glass	1
one,	1
two--missed	1
a	1
glass.'	1
And	1
so	1
on."	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
second	1
of	1
stillness	1
in	1
the	1
room,	1
and	1
then	1
everyone	1
with	1
one	1
accord	1
burst	1
out	1
laughing.	1
As	1
they	1
did	1
so	1
the	1
figure	1
in	1
the	1
corner	1
complacently	1
uncoiled	1
all	1
the	1
ropes	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
fall	1
with	1
a	1
flourish.	1
Then,	1
advancing	1
into	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
with	1
a	1
bow,	1
he	1
produced	1
from	1
his	1
pocket	1
a	1
big	1
bill	1
printed	1
in	1
blue	1
and	1
red,	1
which	1
announced	1
that	1
ZALADIN,	1
the	1
World's	1
Greatest	1
Conjurer,	1
Contortionist,	1
Ventriloquist	1
and	1
Human	1
Kangaroo	1
would	1
be	1
ready	1
with	1
an	1
entirely	1
new	1
series	1
of	1
Tricks	1
at	1
the	1
Empire	1
Pavilion,	1
Scarborough,	1
on	1
Monday	1
next	1
at	1
eight	1
o'clock	1
precisely.	1
II.	1
The	1
Paradise	1
of	1
Thieves	1
THE	1
great	1
Muscari,	1
most	1
original	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
Tuscan	1
poets,	1
walked	1
swiftly	1
into	1
his	1
favourite	1
restaurant,	1
which	1
overlooked	1
the	1
Mediterranean,	1
was	1
covered	1
by	1
an	1
awning	1
and	1
fenced	1
by	1
little	1
lemon	1
and	1
orange	1
trees.	1
Waiters	1
in	1
white	1
aprons	1
were	1
already	1
laying	1
out	1
on	1
white	1
tables	1
the	1
insignia	1
of	1
an	1
early	1
and	1
elegant	1
lunch;	1
and	1
this	1
seemed	1
to	1
increase	1
a	1
satisfaction	1
that	1
already	1
touched	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
swagger.	1
Muscari	1
had	1
an	1
eagle	1
nose	1
like	1
Dante;	1
his	1
hair	1
and	1
neckerchief	1
were	1
dark	1
and	1
flowing;	1
he	1
carried	1
a	1
black	1
cloak,	1
and	1
might	1
almost	1
have	1
carried	1
a	1
black	1
mask,	1
so	1
much	1
did	1
he	1
bear	1
with	1
him	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
Venetian	1
melodrama.	1
He	1
acted	1
as	1
if	1
a	1
troubadour	1
had	1
still	1
a	1
definite	1
social	1
office,	1
like	1
a	1
bishop.	1
He	1
went	1
as	1
near	1
as	1
his	1
century	1
permitted	1
to	1
walking	1
the	1
world	1
literally	1
like	1
Don	1
Juan,	1
with	1
rapier	1
and	1
guitar.	1
For	1
he	1
never	1
travelled	1
without	1
a	1
case	1
of	1
swords,	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
fought	1
many	1
brilliant	1
duels,	1
or	1
without	1
a	1
corresponding	1
case	1
for	1
his	1
mandolin,	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
actually	1
serenaded	1
Miss	1
Ethel	1
Harrogate,	1
the	1
highly	1
conventional	1
daughter	1
of	1
a	1
Yorkshire	1
banker	1
on	1
a	1
holiday.	1
Yet	1
he	1
was	1
neither	1
a	1
charlatan	1
nor	1
a	1
child;	1
but	1
a	1
hot,	1
logical	1
Latin	1
who	1
liked	1
a	1
certain	1
thing	1
and	1
was	1
it.	1
His	1
poetry	1
was	1
as	1
straightforward	1
as	1
anyone	1
else's	1
prose.	1
He	1
desired	1
fame	1
or	1
wine	1
or	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
women	1
with	1
a	1
torrid	1
directness	1
inconceivable	1
among	1
the	1
cloudy	1
ideals	1
or	1
cloudy	1
compromises	1
of	1
the	1
north;	1
to	1
vaguer	1
races	1
his	1
intensity	1
smelt	1
of	1
danger	1
or	1
even	1
crime.	1
Like	1
fire	1
or	1
the	1
sea,	1
he	1
was	1
too	1
simple	1
to	1
be	1
trusted.	1
The	1
banker	1
and	1
his	1
beautiful	1
English	1
daughter	1
were	1
staying	1
at	1
the	1
hotel	1
attached	1
to	1
Muscari's	1
restaurant;	1
that	1
was	1
why	1
it	1
was	1
his	1
favourite	1
restaurant.	1
A	1
glance	1
flashed	1
around	1
the	1
room	1
told	1
him	1
at	1
once,	1
however,	1
that	1
the	1
English	1
party	1
had	1
not	1
descended.	1
The	1
restaurant	1
was	1
glittering,	1
but	1
still	1
comparatively	1
empty.	1
Two	1
priests	1
were	1
talking	1
at	1
a	1
table	1
in	1
a	1
corner,	1
but	1
Muscari	1
(an	1
ardent	1
Catholic)	1
took	1
no	1
more	1
notice	1
of	1
them	1
than	1
of	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
crows.	1
But	1
from	1
a	1
yet	1
farther	1
seat,	1
partly	1
concealed	1
behind	1
a	1
dwarf	1
tree	1
golden	1
with	1
oranges,	1
there	1
rose	1
and	1
advanced	1
towards	1
the	1
poet	1
a	1
person	1
whose	1
costume	1
was	1
the	1
most	1
aggressively	1
opposite	1
to	1
his	1
own.	1
This	1
figure	1
was	1
clad	1
in	1
tweeds	1
of	1
a	1
piebald	1
check,	1
with	1
a	1
pink	1
tie,	1
a	1
sharp	1
collar	1
and	1
protuberant	1
yellow	1
boots.	1
He	1
contrived,	1
in	1
the	1
true	1
tradition	1
of	1
'Arry	1
at	1
Margate,	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
once	1
startling	1
and	1
commonplace.	1
But	1
as	1
the	1
Cockney	1
apparition	1
drew	1
nearer,	1
Muscari	1
was	1
astounded	1
to	1
observe	1
that	1
the	1
head	1
was	1
distinctly	1
different	1
from	1
the	1
body.	1
It	1
was	1
an	1
Italian	1
head:	1
fuzzy,	1
swarthy	1
and	1
very	1
vivacious,	1
that	1
rose	1
abruptly	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
standing	1
collar	1
like	1
cardboard	1
and	1
the	1
comic	1
pink	1
tie.	1
In	1
fact	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
head	1
he	1
knew.	1
He	1
recognized	1
it,	1
above	1
all	1
the	1
dire	1
erection	1
of	1
English	1
holiday	1
array,	1
as	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
an	1
old	1
but	1
forgotten	1
friend	1
name	1
Ezza.	1
This	1
youth	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
prodigy	1
at	1
college,	1
and	1
European	1
fame	1
was	1
promised	1
him	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
barely	1
fifteen;	1
but	1
when	1
he	1
appeared	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
he	1
failed,	1
first	1
publicly	1
as	1
a	1
dramatist	1
and	1
a	1
demagogue,	1
and	1
then	1
privately	1
for	1
years	1
on	1
end	1
as	1
an	1
actor,	1
a	1
traveller,	1
a	1
commission	1
agent	1
or	1
a	1
journalist.	1
Muscari	1
had	1
known	1
him	1
last	1
behind	1
the	1
footlights;	1
he	1
was	1
but	1
too	1
well	1
attuned	1
to	1
the	1
excitements	1
of	1
that	1
profession,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
believed	1
that	1
some	1
moral	1
calamity	1
had	1
swallowed	1
him	1
up.	1
"Ezza!"	1
cried	1
the	1
poet,	1
rising	1
and	1
shaking	1
hands	1
in	1
a	1
pleasant	1
astonishment.	1
"Well,	1
I've	1
seen	1
you	1
in	1
many	1
costumes	1
in	1
the	1
green	1
room;	1
but	1
I	1
never	1
expected	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
dressed	1
up	1
as	1
an	1
Englishman."	1
"This,"	1
answered	1
Ezza	1
gravely,	1
"is	1
not	1
the	1
costume	1
of	1
an	1
Englishman,	1
but	1
of	1
the	1
Italian	1
of	1
the	1
future."	1
"In	1
that	1
case,"	1
remarked	1
Muscari,	1
"I	1
confess	1
I	1
prefer	1
the	1
Italian	1
of	1
the	1
past."	1
"That	1
is	1
your	1
old	1
mistake,	1
Muscari,"	1
said	1
the	1
man	1
in	1
tweeds,	1
shaking	1
his	1
head;	1
"and	1
the	1
mistake	1
of	1
Italy.	1
In	1
the	1
sixteenth	1
century	1
we	1
Tuscans	1
made	1
the	1
morning:	1
we	1
had	1
the	1
newest	1
steel,	1
the	1
newest	1
carving,	1
the	1
newest	1
chemistry.	1
Why	1
should	1
we	1
not	1
now	1
have	1
the	1
newest	1
factories,	1
the	1
newest	1
motors,	1
the	1
newest	1
finance--the	1
newest	1
clothes?"	1
"Because	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
worth	1
having,"	1
answered	1
Muscari.	1
"You	1
cannot	1
make	1
Italians	1
really	1
progressive;	1
they	1
are	1
too	1
intelligent.	1
Men	1
who	1
see	1
the	1
short	1
cut	1
to	1
good	1
living	1
will	1
never	1
go	1
by	1
the	1
new	1
elaborate	1
roads."	1
"Well,	1
to	1
me	1
Marconi,	1
or	1
D'Annunzio,	1
is	1
the	1
star	1
of	1
Italy"	1
said	1
the	1
other.	1
"That	1
is	1
why	1
I	1
have	1
become	1
a	1
Futurist--and	1
a	1
courier."	1
"A	1
courier!"	1
cried	1
Muscari,	1
laughing.	1
"Is	1
that	1
the	1
last	1
of	1
your	1
list	1
of	1
trades?	1
And	1
whom	1
are	1
you	1
conducting?"	1
"Oh,	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Harrogate,	1
and	1
his	1
family,	1
I	1
believe."	1
"Not	1
the	1
banker	1
in	1
this	1
hotel?"	1
inquired	1
the	1
poet,	1
with	1
some	1
eagerness.	1
"That's	1
the	1
man,"	1
answered	1
the	1
courier.	1
"Does	1
it	1
pay	1
well?"	1
asked	1
the	1
troubadour	1
innocently.	1
"It	1
will	1
pay	1
me,"	1
said	1
Ezza,	1
with	1
a	1
very	1
enigmatic	1
smile.	1
"But	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
rather	1
curious	1
sort	1
of	1
courier."	1
Then,	1
as	1
if	1
changing	1
the	1
subject,	1
he	1
said	1
abruptly:	1
"He	1
has	1
a	1
daughter--and	1
a	1
son."	1
"The	1
daughter	1
is	1
divine,"	1
affirmed	1
Muscari,	1
"the	1
father	1
and	1
son	1
are,	1
I	1
suppose,	1
human.	1
But	1
granted	1
his	1
harmless	1
qualities	1
doesn't	1
that	1
banker	1
strike	1
you	1
as	1
a	1
splendid	1
instance	1
of	1
my	1
argument?	1
Harrogate	1
has	1
millions	1
in	1
his	1
safes,	1
and	1
I	1
have--the	1
hole	1
in	1
my	1
pocket.	1
But	1
you	1
daren't	1
say--	1
you	1
can't	1
say--that	1
he's	1
cleverer	1
than	1
I,	1
or	1
bolder	1
than	1
I,	1
or	1
even	1
more	1
energetic.	1
He's	1
not	1
clever,	1
he's	1
got	1
eyes	1
like	1
blue	1
buttons;	1
he's	1
not	1
energetic,	1
he	1
moves	1
from	1
chair	1
to	1
chair	1
like	1
a	1
paralytic.	1
He's	1
a	1
conscientious,	1
kindly	1
old	1
blockhead;	1
but	1
he's	1
got	1
money	1
simply	1
because	1
he	1
collects	1
money,	1
as	1
a	1
boy	1
collects	1
stamps.	1
You're	1
too	1
strong-minded	1
for	1
business,	1
Ezza.	1
You	1
won't	1
get	1
on.	1
To	1
be	1
clever	1
enough	1
to	1
get	1
all	1
that	1
money,	1
one	1
must	1
be	1
stupid	1
enough	1
to	1
want	1
it."	1
"I'm	1
stupid	1
enough	1
for	1
that,"	1
said	1
Ezza	1
gloomily.	1
"But	1
I	1
should	1
suggest	1
a	1
suspension	1
of	1
your	1
critique	1
of	1
the	1
banker,	1
for	1
here	1
he	1
comes."	1
Mr	1
Harrogate,	1
the	1
great	1
financier,	1
did	1
indeed	1
enter	1
the	1
room,	1
but	1
nobody	1
looked	1
at	1
him.	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
massive	1
elderly	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
boiled	1
blue	1
eye	1
and	1
faded	1
grey-sandy	1
moustaches;	1
but	1
for	1
his	1
heavy	1
stoop	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
colonel.	1
He	1
carried	1
several	1
unopened	1
letters	1
in	1
his	1
hand.	1
His	1
son	1
Frank	1
was	1
a	1
really	1
fine	1
lad,	1
curly-haired,	1
sun-burnt	1
and	1
strenuous;	1
but	1
nobody	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
either.	1
All	1
eyes,	1
as	1
usual,	1
were	1
riveted,	1
for	1
the	1
moment	1
at	1
least,	1
upon	1
Ethel	1
Harrogate,	1
whose	1
golden	1
Greek	1
head	1
and	1
colour	1
of	1
the	1
dawn	1
seemed	1
set	1
purposely	1
above	1
that	1
sapphire	1
sea,	1
like	1
a	1
goddess's.	1
The	1
poet	1
Muscari	1
drew	1
a	1
deep	1
breath	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
drinking	1
something,	1
as	1
indeed	1
he	1
was.	1
He	1
was	1
drinking	1
the	1
Classic;	1
which	1
his	1
fathers	1
made.	1
Ezza	1
studied	1
her	1
with	1
a	1
gaze	1
equally	1
intense	1
and	1
far	1
more	1
baffling.	1
Miss	1
Harrogate	1
was	1
specially	1
radiant	1
and	1
ready	1
for	1
conversation	1
on	1
this	1
occasion;	1
and	1
her	1
family	1
had	1
fallen	1
into	1
the	1
easier	1
Continental	1
habit,	1
allowing	1
the	1
stranger	1
Muscari	1
and	1
even	1
the	1
courier	1
Ezza	1
to	1
share	1
their	1
table	1
and	1
their	1
talk.	1
In	1
Ethel	1
Harrogate	1
conventionality	1
crowned	1
itself	1
with	1
a	1
perfection	1
and	1
splendour	1
of	1
its	1
own.	1
Proud	1
of	1
her	1
father's	1
prosperity,	1
fond	1
of	1
fashionable	1
pleasures,	1
a	1
fond	1
daughter	1
but	1
an	1
arrant	1
flirt,	1
she	1
was	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
with	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
golden	1
good-nature	1
that	1
made	1
her	1
very	1
pride	1
pleasing	1
and	1
her	1
worldly	1
respectability	1
a	1
fresh	1
and	1
hearty	1
thing.	1
They	1
were	1
in	1
an	1
eddy	1
of	1
excitement	1
about	1
some	1
alleged	1
peril	1
in	1
the	1
mountain	1
path	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
attempt	1
that	1
week.	1
The	1
danger	1
was	1
not	1
from	1
rock	1
and	1
avalanche,	1
but	1
from	1
something	1
yet	1
more	1
romantic.	1
Ethel	1
had	1
been	1
earnestly	1
assured	1
that	1
brigands,	1
the	1
true	1
cut-throats	1
of	1
the	1
modern	1
legend,	1
still	1
haunted	1
that	1
ridge	1
and	1
held	1
that	1
pass	1
of	1
the	1
Apennines.	1
"They	1
say,"	1
she	1
cried,	1
with	1
the	1
awful	1
relish	1
of	1
a	1
schoolgirl,	1
"that	1
all	1
that	1
country	1
isn't	1
ruled	1
by	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
Italy,	1
but	1
by	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
Thieves.	1
Who	1
is	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
Thieves?"	1
"A	1
great	1
man,"	1
replied	1
Muscari,	1
"worthy	1
to	1
rank	1
with	1
your	1
own	1
Robin	1
Hood,	1
signorina.	1
Montano,	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
Thieves,	1
was	1
first	1
heard	1
of	1
in	1
the	1
mountains	1
some	1
ten	1
years	1
ago,	1
when	1
people	1
said	1
brigands	1
were	1
extinct.	1
But	1
his	1
wild	1
authority	1
spread	1
with	1
the	1
swiftness	1
of	1
a	1
silent	1
revolution.	1
Men	1
found	1
his	1
fierce	1
proclamations	1
nailed	1
in	1
every	1
mountain	1
village;	1
his	1
sentinels,	1
gun	1
in	1
hand,	1
in	1
every	1
mountain	1
ravine.	1
Six	1
times	1
the	1
Italian	1
Government	1
tried	1
to	1
dislodge	1
him,	1
and	1
was	1
defeated	1
in	1
six	1
pitched	1
battles	1
as	1
if	1
by	1
Napoleon."	1
"Now	1
that	1
sort	1
of	1
thing,"	1
observed	1
the	1
banker	1
weightily,	1
"would	1
never	1
be	1
allowed	1
in	1
England;	1
perhaps,	1
after	1
all,	1
we	1
had	1
better	1
choose	1
another	1
route.	1
But	1
the	1
courier	1
thought	1
it	1
perfectly	1
safe."	1
"It	1
is	1
perfectly	1
safe,"	1
said	1
the	1
courier	1
contemptuously.	1
"I	1
have	1
been	1
over	1
it	1
twenty	1
times.	1
There	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
some	1
old	1
jailbird	1
called	1
a	1
King	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
our	1
grandmothers;	1
but	1
he	1
belongs	1
to	1
history	1
if	1
not	1
to	1
fable.	1
Brigandage	1
is	1
utterly	1
stamped	1
out."	1
"It	1
can	1
never	1
be	1
utterly	1
stamped	1
out,"	1
Muscari	1
answered;	1
"because	1
armed	1
revolt	1
is	1
a	1
recreation	1
natural	1
to	1
southerners.	1
Our	1
peasants	1
are	1
like	1
their	1
mountains,	1
rich	1
in	1
grace	1
and	1
green	1
gaiety,	1
but	1
with	1
the	1
fires	1
beneath.	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
point	1
of	1
human	1
despair	1
where	1
the	1
northern	1
poor	1
take	1
to	1
drink--and	1
our	1
own	1
poor	1
take	1
to	1
daggers."	1
"A	1
poet	1
is	1
privileged,"	1
replied	1
Ezza,	1
with	1
a	1
sneer.	1
"If	1
Signor	1
Muscari	1
were	1
English	1
be	1
would	1
still	1
be	1
looking	1
for	1
highwaymen	1
in	1
Wandsworth.	1
Believe	1
me,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
more	1
danger	1
of	1
being	1
captured	1
in	1
Italy	1
than	1
of	1
being	1
scalped	1
in	1
Boston."	1
"Then	1
you	1
propose	1
to	1
attempt	1
it?"	1
asked	1
Mr	1
Harrogate,	1
frowning.	1
"Oh,	1
it	1
sounds	1
rather	1
dreadful,"	1
cried	1
the	1
girl,	1
turning	1
her	1
glorious	1
eyes	1
on	1
Muscari.	1
"Do	1
you	1
really	1
think	1
the	1
pass	1
is	1
dangerous?"	1
Muscari	1
threw	1
back	1
his	1
black	1
mane.	1
"I	1
know	1
it	1
is	1
dangerous:"	1
he	1
said.	1
"I	1
am	1
crossing	1
it	1
tomorrow."	1
The	1
young	1
Harrogate	1
was	1
left	1
behind	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
emptying	1
a	1
glass	1
of	1
white	1
wine	1
and	1
lighting	1
a	1
cigarette,	1
as	1
the	1
beauty	1
retired	1
with	1
the	1
banker,	1
the	1
courier	1
and	1
the	1
poet,	1
distributing	1
peals	1
of	1
silvery	1
satire.	1
At	1
about	1
the	1
same	1
instant	1
the	1
two	1
priests	1
in	1
the	1
corner	1
rose;	1
the	1
taller,	1
a	1
white-haired	1
Italian,	1
taking	1
his	1
leave.	1
The	1
shorter	1
priest	1
turned	1
and	1
walked	1
towards	1
the	1
banker's	1
son,	1
and	1
the	1
latter	1
was	1
astonished	1
to	1
realize	1
that	1
though	1
a	1
Roman	1
priest	1
the	1
man	1
was	1
an	1
Englishman.	1
He	1
vaguely	1
remembered	1
meeting	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
social	1
crushes	1
of	1
some	1
of	1
his	1
Catholic	1
friends.	1
But	1
the	1
man	1
spoke	1
before	1
his	1
memories	1
could	1
collect	1
themselves.	1
"Mr	1
Frank	1
Harrogate,	1
I	1
think,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"I	1
have	1
had	1
an	1
introduction,	1
but	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
mean	1
to	1
presume	1
on	1
it.	1
The	1
odd	1
thing	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
say	1
will	1
come	1
far	1
better	1
from	1
a	1
stranger.	1
Mr	1
Harrogate,	1
I	1
say	1
one	1
word	1
and	1
go:	1
take	1
care	1
of	1
your	1
sister	1
in	1
her	1
great	1
sorrow."	1
Even	1
for	1
Frank's	1
truly	1
fraternal	1
indifference	1
the	1
radiance	1
and	1
derision	1
of	1
his	1
sister	1
still	1
seemed	1
to	1
sparkle	1
and	1
ring;	1
he	1
could	1
hear	1
her	1
laughter	1
still	1
from	1
the	1
garden	1
of	1
the	1
hotel,	1
and	1
he	1
stared	1
at	1
his	1
sombre	1
adviser	1
in	1
puzzledom.	1
"Do	1
you	1
mean	1
the	1
brigands?"	1
he	1
asked;	1
and	1
then,	1
remembering	1
a	1
vague	1
fear	1
of	1
his	1
own,	1
"or	1
can	1
you	1
be	1
thinking	1
of	1
Muscari?"	1
"One	1
is	1
never	1
thinking	1
of	1
the	1
real	1
sorrow,"	1
said	1
the	1
strange	1
priest.	1
"One	1
can	1
only	1
be	1
kind	1
when	1
it	1
comes."	1
And	1
he	1
passed	1
promptly	1
from	1
the	1
room,	1
leaving	1
the	1
other	1
almost	1
with	1
his	1
mouth	1
open.	1
A	1
day	1
or	1
two	1
afterwards	1
a	1
coach	1
containing	1
the	1
company	1
was	1
really	1
crawling	1
and	1
staggering	1
up	1
the	1
spurs	1
of	1
the	1
menacing	1
mountain	1
range.	1
Between	1
Ezza's	1
cheery	1
denial	1
of	1
the	1
danger	1
and	1
Muscari's	1
boisterous	1
defiance	1
of	1
it,	1
the	1
financial	1
family	1
were	1
firm	1
in	1
their	1
original	1
purpose;	1
and	1
Muscari	1
made	1
his	1
mountain	1
journey	1
coincide	1
with	1
theirs.	1
A	1
more	1
surprising	1
feature	1
was	1
the	1
appearance	1
at	1
the	1
coast-town	1
station	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
priest	1
of	1
the	1
restaurant;	1
he	1
alleged	1
merely	1
that	1
business	1
led	1
him	1
also	1
to	1
cross	1
the	1
mountains	1
of	1
the	1
midland.	1
But	1
young	1
Harrogate	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
connect	1
his	1
presence	1
with	1
the	1
mystical	1
fears	1
and	1
warnings	1
of	1
yesterday.	1
The	1
coach	1
was	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
commodious	1
wagonette,	1
invented	1
by	1
the	1
modernist	1
talent	1
of	1
the	1
courier,	1
who	1
dominated	1
the	1
expedition	1
with	1
his	1
scientific	1
activity	1
and	1
breezy	1
wit.	1
The	1
theory	1
of	1
danger	1
from	1
thieves	1
was	1
banished	1
from	1
thought	1
and	1
speech;	1
though	1
so	1
far	1
conceded	1
in	1
formal	1
act	1
that	1
some	1
slight	1
protection	1
was	1
employed.	1
The	1
courier	1
and	1
the	1
young	1
banker	1
carried	1
loaded	1
revolvers,	1
and	1
Muscari	1
(with	1
much	1
boyish	1
gratification)	1
buckled	1
on	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
cutlass	1
under	1
his	1
black	1
cloak.	1
He	1
had	1
planted	1
his	1
person	1
at	1
a	1
flying	1
leap	1
next	1
to	1
the	1
lovely	1
Englishwoman;	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
her	1
sat	1
the	1
priest,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Brown	1
and	1
who	1
was	1
fortunately	1
a	1
silent	1
individual;	1
the	1
courier	1
and	1
the	1
father	1
and	1
son	1
were	1
on	1
the	1
banc	1
behind.	1
Muscari	1
was	1
in	1
towering	1
spirits,	1
seriously	1
believing	1
in	1
the	1
peril,	1
and	1
his	1
talk	1
to	1
Ethel	1
might	1
well	1
have	1
made	1
her	1
think	1
him	1
a	1
maniac.	1
But	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
in	1
the	1
crazy	1
and	1
gorgeous	1
ascent,	1
amid	1
crags	1
like	1
peaks	1
loaded	1
with	1
woods	1
like	1
orchards,	1
that	1
dragged	1
her	1
spirit	1
up	1
alone	1
with	1
his	1
into	1
purple	1
preposterous	1
heavens	1
with	1
wheeling	1
suns.	1
The	1
white	1
road	1
climbed	1
like	1
a	1
white	1
cat;	1
it	1
spanned	1
sunless	1
chasms	1
like	1
a	1
tight-rope;	1
it	1
was	1
flung	1
round	1
far-off	1
headlands	1
like	1
a	1
lasso.	1
And	1
yet,	1
however	1
high	1
they	1
went,	1
the	1
desert	1
still	1
blossomed	1
like	1
the	1
rose.	1
The	1
fields	1
were	1
burnished	1
in	1
sun	1
and	1
wind	1
with	1
the	1
colour	1
of	1
kingfisher	1
and	1
parrot	1
and	1
humming-bird,	1
the	1
hues	1
of	1
a	1
hundred	1
flowering	1
flowers.	1
There	1
are	1
no	1
lovelier	1
meadows	1
and	1
woodlands	1
than	1
the	1
English,	1
no	1
nobler	1
crests	1
or	1
chasms	1
than	1
those	1
of	1
Snowdon	1
and	1
Glencoe.	1
But	1
Ethel	1
Harrogate	1
had	1
never	1
before	1
seen	1
the	1
southern	1
parks	1
tilted	1
on	1
the	1
splintered	1
northern	1
peaks;	1
the	1
gorge	1
of	1
Glencoe	1
laden	1
with	1
the	1
fruits	1
of	1
Kent.	1
There	1
was	1
nothing	1
here	1
of	1
that	1
chill	1
and	1
desolation	1
that	1
in	1
Britain	1
one	1
associates	1
with	1
high	1
and	1
wild	1
scenery.	1
It	1
was	1
rather	1
like	1
a	1
mosaic	1
palace,	1
rent	1
with	1
earthquakes;	1
or	1
like	1
a	1
Dutch	1
tulip	1
garden	1
blown	1
to	1
the	1
stars	1
with	1
dynamite.	1
"It's	1
like	1
Kew	1
Gardens	1
on	1
Beachy	1
Head,"	1
said	1
Ethel.	1
"It	1
is	1
our	1
secret,"	1
answered	1
he,	1
"the	1
secret	1
of	1
the	1
volcano;	1
that	1
is	1
also	1
the	1
secret	1
of	1
the	1
revolution--that	1
a	1
thing	1
can	1
be	1
violent	1
and	1
yet	1
fruitful."	1
"You	1
are	1
rather	1
violent	1
yourself,"	1
and	1
she	1
smiled	1
at	1
him.	1
"And	1
yet	1
rather	1
fruitless,"	1
he	1
admitted;	1
"if	1
I	1
die	1
tonight	1
I	1
die	1
unmarried	1
and	1
a	1
fool."	1
"It	1
is	1
not	1
my	1
fault	1
if	1
you	1
have	1
come,"	1
she	1
said	1
after	1
a	1
difficult	1
silence.	1
"It	1
is	1
never	1
your	1
fault,"	1
answered	1
Muscari;	1
"it	1
was	1
not	1
your	1
fault	1
that	1
Troy	1
fell."	1
As	1
they	1
spoke	1
they	1
came	1
under	1
overwhelming	1
cliffs	1
that	1
spread	1
almost	1
like	1
wings	1
above	1
a	1
corner	1
of	1
peculiar	1
peril.	1
Shocked	1
by	1
the	1
big	1
shadow	1
on	1
the	1
narrow	1
ledge,	1
the	1
horses	1
stirred	1
doubtfully.	1
The	1
driver	1
leapt	1
to	1
the	1
earth	1
to	1
hold	1
their	1
heads,	1
and	1
they	1
became	1
ungovernable.	1
One	1
horse	1
reared	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
full	1
height--	1
the	1
titanic	1
and	1
terrifying	1
height	1
of	1
a	1
horse	1
when	1
he	1
becomes	1
a	1
biped.	1
It	1
was	1
just	1
enough	1
to	1
alter	1
the	1
equilibrium;	1
the	1
whole	1
coach	1
heeled	1
over	1
like	1
a	1
ship	1
and	1
crashed	1
through	1
the	1
fringe	1
of	1
bushes	1
over	1
the	1
cliff.	1
Muscari	1
threw	1
an	1
arm	1
round	1
Ethel,	1
who	1
clung	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
shouted	1
aloud.	1
It	1
was	1
for	1
such	1
moments	1
that	1
he	1
lived.	1
At	1
the	1
moment	1
when	1
the	1
gorgeous	1
mountain	1
walls	1
went	1
round	1
the	1
poet's	1
head	1
like	1
a	1
purple	1
windmill	1
a	1
thing	1
happened	1
which	1
was	1
superficially	1
even	1
more	1
startling.	1
The	1
elderly	1
and	1
lethargic	1
banker	1
sprang	1
erect	1
in	1
the	1
coach	1
and	1
leapt	1
over	1
the	1
precipice	1
before	1
the	1
tilted	1
vehicle	1
could	1
take	1
him	1
there.	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
flash	1
it	1
looked	1
as	1
wild	1
as	1
suicide;	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
second	1
it	1
was	1
as	1
sensible	1
as	1
a	1
safe	1
investment.	1
The	1
Yorkshireman	1
had	1
evidently	1
more	1
promptitude,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
more	1
sagacity,	1
than	1
Muscari	1
had	1
given	1
him	1
credit	1
for;	1
for	1
he	1
landed	1
in	1
a	1
lap	1
of	1
land	1
which	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
specially	1
padded	1
with	1
turf	1
and	1
clover	1
to	1
receive	1
him.	1
As	1
it	1
happened,	1
indeed,	1
the	1
whole	1
company	1
were	1
equally	1
lucky,	1
if	1
less	1
dignified	1
in	1
their	1
form	1
of	1
ejection.	1
Immediately	1
under	1
this	1
abrupt	1
turn	1
of	1
the	1
road	1
was	1
a	1
grassy	1
and	1
flowery	1
hollow	1
like	1
a	1
sunken	1
meadow;	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
green	1
velvet	1
pocket	1
in	1
the	1
long,	1
green,	1
trailing	1
garments	1
of	1
the	1
hills.	1
Into	1
this	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
tipped	1
or	1
tumbled	1
with	1
little	1
damage,	1
save	1
that	1
their	1
smallest	1
baggage	1
and	1
even	1
the	1
contents	1
of	1
their	1
pockets	1
were	1
scattered	1
in	1
the	1
grass	1
around	1
them.	1
The	1
wrecked	1
coach	1
still	1
hung	1
above,	1
entangled	1
in	1
the	1
tough	1
hedge,	1
and	1
the	1
horses	1
plunged	1
painfully	1
down	1
the	1
slope.	1
The	1
first	1
to	1
sit	1
up	1
was	1
the	1
little	1
priest,	1
who	1
scratched	1
his	1
head	1
with	1
a	1
face	1
of	1
foolish	1
wonder.	1
Frank	1
Harrogate	1
heard	1
him	1
say	1
to	1
himself:	1
"Now	1
why	1
on	1
earth	1
have	1
we	1
fallen	1
just	1
here?"	1
He	1
blinked	1
at	1
the	1
litter	1
around	1
him,	1
and	1
recovered	1
his	1
own	1
very	1
clumsy	1
umbrella.	1
Beyond	1
it	1
lay	1
the	1
broad	1
sombrero	1
fallen	1
from	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
Muscari,	1
and	1
beside	1
it	1
a	1
sealed	1
business	1
letter	1
which,	1
after	1
a	1
glance	1
at	1
the	1
address,	1
he	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
elder	1
Harrogate.	1
On	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
him	1
the	1
grass	1
partly	1
hid	1
Miss	1
Ethel's	1
sunshade,	1
and	1
just	1
beyond	1
it	1
lay	1
a	1
curious	1
little	1
glass	1
bottle	1
hardly	1
two	1
inches	1
long.	1
The	1
priest	1
picked	1
it	1
up;	1
in	1
a	1
quick,	1
unobtrusive	1
manner	1
he	1
uncorked	1
and	1
sniffed	1
it,	1
and	1
his	1
heavy	1
face	1
turned	1
the	1
colour	1
of	1
clay.	1
"Heaven	1
deliver	1
us!"	1
he	1
muttered;	1
"it	1
can't	1
be	1
hers!	1
Has	1
her	1
sorrow	1
come	1
on	1
her	1
already?"	1
He	1
slipped	1
it	1
into	1
his	1
own	1
waistcoat	1
pocket.	1
"I	1
think	1
I'm	1
justified,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"till	1
I	1
know	1
a	1
little	1
more."	1
He	1
gazed	1
painfully	1
at	1
the	1
girl,	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
being	1
raised	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
flowers	1
by	1
Muscari,	1
who	1
was	1
saying:	1
"We	1
have	1
fallen	1
into	1
heaven;	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
sign.	1
Mortals	1
climb	1
up	1
and	1
they	1
fall	1
down;	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
gods	1
and	1
goddesses	1
who	1
can	1
fall	1
upwards."	1
And	1
indeed	1
she	1
rose	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
of	1
colours	1
so	1
beautiful	1
and	1
happy	1
a	1
vision	1
that	1
the	1
priest	1
felt	1
his	1
suspicion	1
shaken	1
and	1
shifted.	1
"After	1
all,"	1
he	1
thought,	1
"perhaps	1
the	1
poison	1
isn't	1
hers;	1
perhaps	1
it's	1
one	1
of	1
Muscari's	1
melodramatic	1
tricks."	1
Muscari	1
set	1
the	1
lady	1
lightly	1
on	1
her	1
feet,	1
made	1
her	1
an	1
absurdly	1
theatrical	1
bow,	1
and	1
then,	1
drawing	1
his	1
cutlass,	1
hacked	1
hard	1
at	1
the	1
taut	1
reins	1
of	1
the	1
horses,	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
scrambled	1
to	1
their	1
feet	1
and	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
grass	1
trembling.	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
so,	1
a	1
most	1
remarkable	1
thing	1
occurred.	1
A	1
very	1
quiet	1
man,	1
very	1
poorly	1
dressed	1
and	1
extremely	1
sunburnt,	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
bushes	1
and	1
took	1
hold	1
of	1
the	1
horses'	1
heads.	1
He	1
had	1
a	1
queer-shaped	1
knife,	1
very	1
broad	1
and	1
crooked,	1
buckled	1
on	1
his	1
belt;	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
else	1
remarkable	1
about	1
him,	1
except	1
his	1
sudden	1
and	1
silent	1
appearance.	1
The	1
poet	1
asked	1
him	1
who	1
he	1
was,	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
answer.	1
Looking	1
around	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
confused	1
and	1
startled	1
group	1
in	1
the	1
hollow,	1
Muscari	1
then	1
perceived	1
that	1
another	1
tanned	1
and	1
tattered	1
man,	1
with	1
a	1
short	1
gun	1
under	1
his	1
arm,	1
was	1
looking	1
at	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
ledge	1
just	1
below,	1
leaning	1
his	1
elbows	1
on	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
turf.	1
Then	1
he	1
looked	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
road	1
from	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
fallen	1
and	1
saw,	1
looking	1
down	1
on	1
them,	1
the	1
muzzles	1
of	1
four	1
other	1
carbines	1
and	1
four	1
other	1
brown	1
faces	1
with	1
bright	1
but	1
quite	1
motionless	1
eyes.	1
"The	1
brigands!"	1
cried	1
Muscari,	1
with	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
monstrous	1
gaiety.	1
"This	1
was	1
a	1
trap.	1
Ezza,	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
oblige	1
me	1
by	1
shooting	1
the	1
coachman	1
first,	1
we	1
can	1
cut	1
our	1
way	1
out	1
yet.	1
There	1
are	1
only	1
six	1
of	1
them."	1
"The	1
coachman,"	1
said	1
Ezza,	1
who	1
was	1
standing	1
grimly	1
with	1
his	1
hands	1
in	1
his	1
pockets,	1
"happens	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
servant	1
of	1
Mr	1
Harrogate's."	1
"Then	1
shoot	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
more,"	1
cried	1
the	1
poet	1
impatiently;	1
"he	1
was	1
bribed	1
to	1
upset	1
his	1
master.	1
Then	1
put	1
the	1
lady	1
in	1
the	1
middle,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
break	1
the	1
line	1
up	1
there--with	1
a	1
rush."	1
And,	1
wading	1
in	1
wild	1
grass	1
and	1
flowers,	1
he	1
advanced	1
fearlessly	1
on	1
the	1
four	1
carbines;	1
but	1
finding	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
followed	1
except	1
young	1
Harrogate,	1
he	1
turned,	1
brandishing	1
his	1
cutlass	1
to	1
wave	1
the	1
others	1
on.	1
He	1
beheld	1
the	1
courier	1
still	1
standing	1
slightly	1
astride	1
in	1
the	1
centre	1
of	1
the	1
grassy	1
ring,	1
his	1
hands	1
in	1
his	1
pockets;	1
and	1
his	1
lean,	1
ironical	1
Italian	1
face	1
seemed	1
to	1
grow	1
longer	1
and	1
longer	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
light.	1
"You	1
thought,	1
Muscari,	1
I	1
was	1
the	1
failure	1
among	1
our	1
schoolfellows,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"and	1
you	1
thought	1
you	1
were	1
the	1
success.	1
But	1
I	1
have	1
succeeded	1
more	1
than	1
you	1
and	1
fill	1
a	1
bigger	1
place	1
in	1
history.	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
acting	1
epics	1
while	1
you	1
have	1
been	1
writing	1
them."	1
"Come	1
on,	1
I	1
tell	1
you!"	1
thundered	1
Muscari	1
from	1
above.	1
"Will	1
you	1
stand	1
there	1
talking	1
nonsense	1
about	1
yourself	1
with	1
a	1
woman	1
to	1
save	1
and	1
three	1
strong	1
men	1
to	1
help	1
you?	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
call	1
yourself?"	1
"I	1
call	1
myself	1
Montano,"	1
cried	1
the	1
strange	1
courier	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
equally	1
loud	1
and	1
full.	1
"I	1
am	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
Thieves,	1
and	1
I	1
welcome	1
you	1
all	1
to	1
my	1
summer	1
palace."	1
And	1
even	1
as	1
he	1
spoke	1
five	1
more	1
silent	1
men	1
with	1
weapons	1
ready	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
bushes,	1
and	1
looked	1
towards	1
him	1
for	1
their	1
orders.	1
One	1
of	1
them	1
held	1
a	1
large	1
paper	1
in	1
his	1
hand.	1
"This	1
pretty	1
little	1
nest	1
where	1
we	1
are	1
all	1
picnicking,"	1
went	1
on	1
the	1
courier-brigand,	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
easy	1
yet	1
sinister	1
smile,	1
"is,	1
together	1
with	1
some	1
caves	1
underneath	1
it,	1
known	1
by	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Paradise	1
of	1
Thieves.	1
It	1
is	1
my	1
principal	1
stronghold	1
on	1
these	1
hills;	1
for	1
(as	1
you	1
have	1
doubtless	1
noticed)	1
the	1
eyrie	1
is	1
invisible	1
both	1
from	1
the	1
road	1
above	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
valley	1
below.	1
It	1
is	1
something	1
better	1
than	1
impregnable;	1
it	1
is	1
unnoticeable.	1
Here	1
I	1
mostly	1
live,	1
and	1
here	1
I	1
shall	1
certainly	1
die,	1
if	1
the	1
gendarmes	1
ever	1
track	1
me	1
here.	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
the	1
kind	1
of	1
criminal	1
that	1
`reserves	1
his	1
defence,'	1
but	1
the	1
better	1
kind	1
that	1
reserves	1
his	1
last	1
bullet."	1
All	1
were	1
staring	1
at	1
him	1
thunderstruck	1
and	1
still,	1
except	1
Father	1
Brown,	1
who	1
heaved	1
a	1
huge	1
sigh	1
as	1
of	1
relief	1
and	1
fingered	1
the	1
little	1
phial	1
in	1
his	1
pocket.	1
"Thank	1
God!"	1
he	1
muttered;	1
"that's	1
much	1
more	1
probable.	1
The	1
poison	1
belongs	1
to	1
this	1
robber-chief,	1
of	1
course.	1
He	1
carries	1
it	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
never	1
be	1
captured,	1
like	1
Cato."	1
The	1
King	1
of	1
Thieves	1
was,	1
however,	1
continuing	1
his	1
address	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
kind	1
of	1
dangerous	1
politeness.	1
"It	1
only	1
remains	1
for	1
me,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"to	1
explain	1
to	1
my	1
guests	1
the	1
social	1
conditions	1
upon	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
entertaining	1
them.	1
I	1
need	1
not	1
expound	1
the	1
quaint	1
old	1
ritual	1
of	1
ransom,	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
incumbent	1
upon	1
me	1
to	1
keep	1
up;	1
and	1
even	1
this	1
only	1
applies	1
to	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
company.	1
The	1
Reverend	1
Father	1
Brown	1
and	1
the	1
celebrated	1
Signor	1
Muscari	1
I	1
shall	1
release	1
tomorrow	1
at	1
dawn	1
and	1
escort	1
to	1
my	1
outposts.	1
Poets	1
and	1
priests,	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
pardon	1
my	1
simplicity	1
of	1
speech,	1
never	1
have	1
any	1
money.	1
And	1
so	1
(since	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
to	1
get	1
anything	1
out	1
of	1
them),	1
let	1
us,	1
seize	1
the	1
opportunity	1
to	1
show	1
our	1
admiration	1
for	1
classic	1
literature	1
and	1
our	1
reverence	1
for	1
Holy	1
Church."	1
He	1
paused	1
with	1
an	1
unpleasing	1
smile;	1
and	1
Father	1
Brown	1
blinked	1
repeatedly	1
at	1
him,	1
and	1
seemed	1
suddenly	1
to	1
be	1
listening	1
with	1
great	1
attention.	1
The	1
brigand	1
captain	1
took	1
the	1
large	1
paper	1
from	1
the	1
attendant	1
brigand	1
and,	1
glancing	1
over	1
it,	1
continued:	1
"My	1
other	1
intentions	1
are	1
clearly	1
set	1
forth	1
in	1
this	1
public	1
document,	1
which	1
I	1
will	1
hand	1
round	1
in	1
a	1
moment;	1
and	1
which	1
after	1
that	1
will	1
be	1
posted	1
on	1
a	1
tree	1
by	1
every	1
village	1
in	1
the	1
valley,	1
and	1
every	1
cross-road	1
in	1
the	1
hills.	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
weary	1
you	1
with	1
the	1
verbalism,	1
since	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
check	1
it;	1
the	1
substance	1
of	1
my	1
proclamation	1
is	1
this:	1
I	1
announce	1
first	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
captured	1
the	1
English	1
millionaire,	1
the	1
colossus	1
of	1
finance,	1
Mr	1
Samuel	1
Harrogate.	1
I	1
next	1
announce	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
on	1
his	1
person	1
notes	1
and	1
bonds	1
for	1
two	1
thousand	1
pounds,	1
which	1
he	1
has	1
given	1
up	1
to	1
me.	1
Now	1
since	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
really	1
immoral	1
to	1
announce	1
such	1
a	1
thing	1
to	1
a	1
credulous	1
public	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
not	1
occurred,	1
I	1
suggest	1
it	1
should	1
occur	1
without	1
further	1
delay.	1
I	1
suggest	1
that	1
Mr	1
Harrogate	1
senior	1
should	1
now	1
give	1
me	1
the	1
two	1
thousand	1
pounds	1
in	1
his	1
pocket."	1
The	1
banker	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
under	1
lowering	1
brows,	1
red-faced	1
and	1
sulky,	1
but	1
seemingly	1
cowed.	1
That	1
leap	1
from	1
the	1
failing	1
carriage	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
used	1
up	1
his	1
last	1
virility.	1
He	1
had	1
held	1
back	1
in	1
a	1
hang-dog	1
style	1
when	1
his	1
son	1
and	1
Muscari	1
had	1
made	1
a	1
bold	1
movement	1
to	1
break	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
brigand	1
trap.	1
And	1
now	1
his	1
red	1
and	1
trembling	1
hand	1
went	1
reluctantly	1
to	1
his	1
breast-pocket,	1
and	1
passed	1
a	1
bundle	1
of	1
papers	1
and	1
envelopes	1
to	1
the	1
brigand.	1
"Excellent!"	1
cried	1
that	1
outlaw	1
gaily;	1
"so	1
far	1
we	1
are	1
all	1
cosy.	1
I	1
resume	1
the	1
points	1
of	1
my	1
proclamation,	1
so	1
soon	1
to	1
be	1
published	1
to	1
all	1
Italy.	1
The	1
third	1
item	1
is	1
that	1
of	1
ransom.	1
I	1
am	1
asking	1
from	1
the	1
friends	1
of	1
the	1
Harrogate	1
family	1
a	1
ransom	1
of	1
three	1
thousand	1
pounds,	1
which	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
is	1
almost	1
insulting	1
to	1
that	1
family	1
in	1
its	1
moderate	1
estimate	1
of	1
their	1
importance.	1
Who	1
would	1
not	1
pay	1
triple	1
this	1
sum	1
for	1
another	1
day's	1
association	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
domestic	1
circle?	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
conceal	1
from	1
you	1
that	1
the	1
document	1
ends	1
with	1
certain	1
legal	1
phrases	1
about	1
the	1
unpleasant	1
things	1
that	1
may	1
happen	1
if	1
the	1
money	1
is	1
not	1
paid;	1
but	1
meanwhile,	1
ladies	1
and	1
gentlemen,	1
let	1
me	1
assure	1
you	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
comfortably	1
off	1
here	1
for	1
accommodation,	1
wine	1
and	1
cigars,	1
and	1
bid	1
you	1
for	1
the	1
present	1
a	1
sportsman-like	1
welcome	1
to	1
the	1
luxuries	1
of	1
the	1
Paradise	1
of	1
Thieves."	1
All	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
speaking,	1
the	1
dubious-looking	1
men	1
with	1
carbines	1
and	1
dirty	1
slouch	1
hats	1
had	1
been	1
gathering	1
silently	1
in	1
such	1
preponderating	1
numbers	1
that	1
even	1
Muscari	1
was	1
compelled	1
to	1
recognize	1
his	1
sally	1
with	1
the	1
sword	1
as	1
hopeless.	1
He	1
glanced	1
around	1
him;	1
but	1
the	1
girl	1
had	1
already	1
gone	1
over	1
to	1
soothe	1
and	1
comfort	1
her	1
father,	1
for	1
her	1
natural	1
affection	1
for	1
his	1
person	1
was	1
as	1
strong	1
or	1
stronger	1
than	1
her	1
somewhat	1
snobbish	1
pride	1
in	1
his	1
success.	1
Muscari,	1
with	1
the	1
illogicality	1
of	1
a	1
lover,	1
admired	1
this	1
filial	1
devotion,	1
and	1
yet	1
was	1
irritated	1
by	1
it.	1
He	1
slapped	1
his	1
sword	1
back	1
in	1
the	1
scabbard	1
and	1
went	1
and	1
flung	1
himself	1
somewhat	1
sulkily	1
on	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
green	1
banks.	1
The	1
priest	1
sat	1
down	1
within	1
a	1
yard	1
or	1
two,	1
and	1
Muscari	1
turned	1
his	1
aquiline	1
nose	1
on	1
him	1
in	1
an	1
instantaneous	1
irritation.	1
"Well,"	1
said	1
the	1
poet	1
tartly,	1
"do	1
people	1
still	1
think	1
me	1
too	1
romantic?	1
Are	1
there,	1
I	1
wonder,	1
any	1
brigands	1
left	1
in	1
the	1
mountains?"	1
"There	1
may	1
be,"	1
said	1
Father	1
Brown	1
agnostically.	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
mean?"	1
asked	1
the	1
other	1
sharply.	1
"I	1
mean	1
I	1
am	1
puzzled,"	1
replied	1
the	1
priest.	1
"I	1
am	1
puzzled	1
about	1
Ezza	1
or	1
Montano,	1
or	1
whatever	1
his	1
name	1
is.	1
He	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
much	1
more	1
inexplicable	1
as	1
a	1
brigand	1
even	1
than	1
he	1
was	1
as	1
a	1
courier."	1
"But	1
in	1
what	1
way?"	1
persisted	1
his	1
companion.	1
"Santa	1
Maria!	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
thought	1
the	1
brigand	1
was	1
plain	1
enough."	1
"I	1
find	1
three	1
curious	1
difficulties,"	1
said	1
the	1
priest	1
in	1
a	1
quiet	1
voice.	1
"I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
have	1
your	1
opinion	1
on	1
them.	1
First	1
of	1
all	1
I	1
must	1
tell	1
you	1
I	1
was	1
lunching	1
in	1
that	1
restaurant	1
at	1
the	1
seaside.	1
As	1
four	1
of	1
you	1
left	1
the	1
room,	1
you	1
and	1
Miss	1
Harrogate	1
went	1
ahead,	1
talking	1
and	1
laughing;	1
the	1
banker	1
and	1
the	1
courier	1
came	1
behind,	1
speaking	1
sparely	1
and	1
rather	1
low.	1
But	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
hearing	1
Ezza	1
say	1
these	1
words--`Well,	1
let	1
her	1
have	1
a	1
little	1
fun;	1
you	1
know	1
the	1
blow	1
may	1
smash	1
her	1
any	1
minute.'	1
Mr	1
Harrogate	1
answered	1
nothing;	1
so	1
the	1
words	1
must	1
have	1
had	1
some	1
meaning.	1
On	1
the	1
impulse	1
of	1
the	1
moment	1
I	1
warned	1
her	1
brother	1
that	1
she	1
might	1
be	1
in	1
peril;	1
I	1
said	1
nothing	1
of	1
its	1
nature,	1
for	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
know.	1
But	1
if	1
it	1
meant	1
this	1
capture	1
in	1
the	1
hills,	1
the	1
thing	1
is	1
nonsense.	1
Why	1
should	1
the	1
brigand-courier	1
warn	1
his	1
patron,	1
even	1
by	1
a	1
hint,	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
his	1
whole	1
purpose	1
to	1
lure	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
mountain-mousetrap?	1
It	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
meant	1
that.	1
But	1
if	1
not,	1
what	1
is	1
this	1
disaster,	1
known	1
both	1
to	1
courier	1
and	1
banker,	1
which	1
hangs	1
over	1
Miss	1
Harrogate's	1
head?"	1
"Disaster	1
to	1
Miss	1
Harrogate!"	1
ejaculated	1
the	1
poet,	1
sitting	1
up	1
with	1
some	1
ferocity.	1
"Explain	1
yourself;	1
go	1
on."	1
"All	1
my	1
riddles,	1
however,	1
revolve	1
round	1
our	1
bandit	1
chief,"	1
resumed	1
the	1
priest	1
reflectively.	1
"And	1
here	1
is	1
the	1
second	1
of	1
them.	1
Why	1
did	1
he	1
put	1
so	1
prominently	1
in	1
his	1
demand	1
for	1
ransom	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
two	1
thousand	1
pounds	1
from	1
his	1
victim	1
on	1
the	1
spot?	1
It	1
had	1
no	1
faintest	1
tendency	1
to	1
evoke	1
the	1
ransom.	1
Quite	1
the	1
other	1
way,	1
in	1
fact.	1
Harrogate's	1
friends	1
would	1
be	1
far	1
likelier	1
to	1
fear	1
for	1
his	1
fate	1
if	1
they	1
thought	1
the	1
thieves	1
were	1
poor	1
and	1
desperate.	1
Yet	1
the	1
spoliation	1
on	1
the	1
spot	1
was	1
emphasized	1
and	1
even	1
put	1
first	1
in	1
the	1
demand.	1
Why	1
should	1
Ezza	1
Montano	1
want	1
so	1
specially	1
to	1
tell	1
all	1
Europe	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
picked	1
the	1
pocket	1
before	1
he	1
levied	1
the	1
blackmail?"	1
"I	1
cannot	1
imagine,"	1
said	1
Muscari,	1
rubbing	1
up	1
his	1
black	1
hair	1
for	1
once	1
with	1
an	1
unaffected	1
gesture.	1
"You	1
may	1
think	1
you	1
enlighten	1
me,	1
but	1
you	1
are	1
leading	1
me	1
deeper	1
in	1
the	1
dark.	1
What	1
may	1
be	1
the	1
third	1
objection	1
to	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
the	1
Thieves?"	1
"The	1
third	1
objection,"	1
said	1
Father	1
Brown,	1
still	1
in	1
meditation,	1
"is	1
this	1
bank	1
we	1
are	1
sitting	1
on.	1
Why	1
does	1
our	1
brigand-courier	1
call	1
this	1
his	1
chief	1
fortress	1
and	1
the	1
Paradise	1
of	1
Thieves?	1
It	1
is	1
certainly	1
a	1
soft	1
spot	1
to	1
fall	1
on	1
and	1
a	1
sweet	1
spot	1
to	1
look	1
at.	1
It	1
is	1
also	1
quite	1
true,	1
as	1
he	1
says,	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
invisible	1
from	1
valley	1
and	1
peak,	1
and	1
is	1
therefore	1
a	1
hiding-place.	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
fortress.	1
It	1
never	1
could	1
be	1
a	1
fortress.	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
worst	1
fortress	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
actually	1
commanded	1
from	1
above	1
by	1
the	1
common	1
high-road	1
across	1
the	1
mountains--	1
the	1
very	1
place	1
where	1
the	1
police	1
would	1
most	1
probably	1
pass.	1
Why,	1
five	1
shabby	1
short	1
guns	1
held	1
us	1
helpless	1
here	1
about	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
ago.	1
The	1
quarter	1
of	1
a	1
company	1
of	1
any	1
kind	1
of	1
soldiers	1
could	1
have	1
blown	1
us	1
over	1
the	1
precipice.	1
Whatever	1
is	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
this	1
odd	1
little	1
nook	1
of	1
grass	1
and	1
flowers,	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
an	1
entrenched	1
position.	1
It	1
is	1
something	1
else;	1
it	1
has	1
some	1
other	1
strange	1
sort	1
of	1
importance;	1
some	1
value	1
that	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
understand.	1
It	1
is	1
more	1
like	1
an	1
accidental	1
theatre	1
or	1
a	1
natural	1
green-room;	1
it	1
is	1
like	1
the	1
scene	1
for	1
some	1
romantic	1
comedy;	1
it	1
is	1
like...."	1
As	1
the	1
little	1
priest's	1
words	1
lengthened	1
and	1
lost	1
themselves	1
in	1
a	1
dull	1
and	1
dreamy	1
sincerity,	1
Muscari,	1
whose	1
animal	1
senses	1
were	1
alert	1
and	1
impatient,	1
heard	1
a	1
new	1
noise	1
in	1
the	1
mountains.	1
Even	1
for	1
him	1
the	1
sound	1
was	1
as	1
yet	1
very	1
small	1
and	1
faint;	1
but	1
he	1
could	1
have	1
sworn	1
the	1
evening	1
breeze	1
bore	1
with	1
it	1
something	1
like	1
the	1
pulsation	1
of	1
horses'	1
hoofs	1
and	1
a	1
distant	1
hallooing.	1
At	1
the	1
same	1
moment,	1
and	1
long	1
before	1
the	1
vibration	1
had	1
touched	1
the	1
less-experienced	1
English	1
ears,	1
Montano	1
the	1
brigand	1
ran	1
up	1
the	1
bank	1
above	1
them	1
and	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
broken	1
hedge,	1
steadying	1
himself	1
against	1
a	1
tree	1
and	1
peering	1
down	1
the	1
road.	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
strange	1
figure	1
as	1
he	1
stood	1
there,	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
assumed	1
a	1
flapped	1
fantastic	1
hat	1
and	1
swinging	1
baldric	1
and	1
cutlass	1
in	1
his	1
capacity	1
of	1
bandit	1
king,	1
but	1
the	1
bright	1
prosaic	1
tweed	1
of	1
the	1
courier	1
showed	1
through	1
in	1
patches	1
all	1
over	1
him.	1
The	1
next	1
moment	1
he	1
turned	1
his	1
olive,	1
sneering	1
face	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
movement	1
with	1
his	1
hand.	1
The	1
brigands	1
scattered	1
at	1
the	1
signal,	1
not	1
in	1
confusion,	1
but	1
in	1
what	1
was	1
evidently	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
guerrilla	1
discipline.	1
Instead	1
of	1
occupying	1
the	1
road	1
along	1
the	1
ridge,	1
they	1
sprinkled	1
themselves	1
along	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
it	1
behind	1
the	1
trees	1
and	1
the	1
hedge,	1
as	1
if	1
watching	1
unseen	1
for	1
an	1
enemy.	1
The	1
noise	1
beyond	1
grew	1
stronger,	1
beginning	1
to	1
shake	1
the	1
mountain	1
road,	1
and	1
a	1
voice	1
could	1
be	1
clearly	1
heard	1
calling	1
out	1
orders.	1
The	1
brigands	1
swayed	1
and	1
huddled,	1
cursing	1
and	1
whispering,	1
and	1
the	1
evening	1
air	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
little	1
metallic	1
noises	1
as	1
they	1
cocked	1
their	1
pistols,	1
or	1
loosened	1
their	1
knives,	1
or	1
trailed	1
their	1
scabbards	1
over	1
the	1
stones.	1
Then	1
the	1
noises	1
from	1
both	1
quarters	1
seemed	1
to	1
meet	1
on	1
the	1
road	1
above;	1
branches	1
broke,	1
horses	1
neighed,	1
men	1
cried	1
out.	1
"A	1
rescue!"	1
cried	1
Muscari,	1
springing	1
to	1
his	1
feet	1
and	1
waving	1
his	1
hat;	1
"the	1
gendarmes	1
are	1
on	1
them!	1
Now	1
for	1
freedom	1
and	1
a	1
blow	1
for	1
it!	1
Now	1
to	1
be	1
rebels	1
against	1
robbers!	1
Come,	1
don't	1
let	1
us	1
leave	1
everything	1
to	1
the	1
police;	1
that	1
is	1
so	1
dreadfully	1
modern.	1
Fall	1
on	1
the	1
rear	1
of	1
these	1
ruffians.	1
The	1
gendarmes	1
are	1
rescuing	1
us;	1
come,	1
friends,	1
let	1
us	1
rescue	1
the	1
gendarmes!"	1
And	1
throwing	1
his	1
hat	1
over	1
the	1
trees,	1
he	1
drew	1
his	1
cutlass	1
once	1
more	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
escalade	1
the	1
slope	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
road.	1
Frank	1
Harrogate	1
jumped	1
up	1
and	1
ran	1
across	1
to	1
help	1
him,	1
revolver	1
in	1
hand,	1
but	1
was	1
astounded	1
to	1
hear	1
himself	1
imperatively	1
recalled	1
by	1
the	1
raucous	1
voice	1
of	1
his	1
father,	1
who	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
great	1
agitation.	1
"I	1
won't	1
have	1
it,"	1
said	1
the	1
banker	1
in	1
a	1
choking	1
voice;	1
"I	1
command	1
you	1
not	1
to	1
interfere."	1
"But,	1
father,"	1
said	1
Frank	1
very	1
warmly,	1
"an	1
Italian	1
gentleman	1
has	1
led	1
the	1
way.	1
You	1
wouldn't	1
have	1
it	1
said	1
that	1
the	1
English	1
hung	1
back."	1
"It	1
is	1
useless,"	1
said	1
the	1
older	1
man,	1
who	1
was	1
trembling	1
violently,	1
"it	1
is	1
useless.	1
We	1
must	1
submit	1
to	1
our	1
lot."	1
Father	1
Brown	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
banker;	1
then	1
he	1
put	1
his	1
hand	1
instinctively	1
as	1
if	1
on	1
his	1
heart,	1
but	1
really	1
on	1
the	1
little	1
bottle	1
of	1
poison;	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
light	1
came	1
into	1
his	1
face	1
like	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
revelation	1
of	1
death.	1
Muscari	1
meanwhile,	1
without	1
waiting	1
for	1
support,	1
had	1
crested	1
the	1
bank	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
road,	1
and	1
struck	1
the	1
brigand	1
king	1
heavily	1
on	1
the	1
shoulder,	1
causing	1
him	1
to	1
stagger	1
and	1
swing	1
round.	1
Montano	1
also	1
had	1
his	1
cutlass	1
unsheathed,	1
and	1
Muscari,	1
without	1
further	1
speech,	1
sent	1
a	1
slash	1
at	1
his	1
head	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
compelled	1
to	1
catch	1
and	1
parry.	1
But	1
even	1
as	1
the	1
two	1
short	1
blades	1
crossed	1
and	1
clashed	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
Thieves	1
deliberately	1
dropped	1
his	1
point	1
and	1
laughed.	1
"What's	1
the	1
good,	1
old	1
man?"	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
spirited	1
Italian	1
slang;	1
"this	1
damned	1
farce	1
will	1
soon	1
be	1
over."	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
mean,	1
you	1
shuffler?"	1
panted	1
the	1
fire-eating	1
poet.	1
"Is	1
your	1
courage	1
a	1
sham	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
your	1
honesty?"	1
"Everything	1
about	1
me	1
is	1
a	1
sham,"	1
responded	1
the	1
ex-courier	1
in	1
complete	1
good	1
humour.	1
"I	1
am	1
an	1
actor;	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
ever	1
had	1
a	1
private	1
character,	1
I	1
have	1
forgotten	1
it.	1
I	1
am	1
no	1
more	1
a	1
genuine	1
brigand	1
than	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
genuine	1
courier.	1
I	1
am	1
only	1
a	1
bundle	1
of	1
masks,	1
and	1
you	1
can't	1
fight	1
a	1
duel	1
with	1
that."	1
And	1
he	1
laughed	1
with	1
boyish	1
pleasure	1
and	1
fell	1
into	1
his	1
old	1
straddling	1
attitude,	1
with	1
his	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
skirmish	1
up	1
the	1
road.	1
Darkness	1
was	1
deepening	1
under	1
the	1
mountain	1
walls,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
easy	1
to	1
discern	1
much	1
of	1
the	1
progress	1
of	1
the	1
struggle,	1
save	1
that	1
tall	1
men	1
were	1
pushing	1
their	1
horses'	1
muzzles	1
through	1
a	1
clinging	1
crowd	1
of	1
brigands,	1
who	1
seemed	1
more	1
inclined	1
to	1
harass	1
and	1
hustle	1
the	1
invaders	1
than	1
to	1
kill	1
them.	1
It	1
was	1
more	1
like	1
a	1
town	1
crowd	1
preventing	1
the	1
passage	1
of	1
the	1
police	1
than	1
anything	1
the	1
poet	1
had	1
ever	1
pictured	1
as	1
the	1
last	1
stand	1
of	1
doomed	1
and	1
outlawed	1
men	1
of	1
blood.	1
Just	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
rolling	1
his	1
eyes	1
in	1
bewilderment	1
he	1
felt	1
a	1
touch	1
on	1
his	1
elbow,	1
and	1
found	1
the	1
odd	1
little	1
priest	1
standing	1
there	1
like	1
a	1
small	1
Noah	1
with	1
a	1
large	1
hat,	1
and	1
requesting	1
the	1
favour	1
of	1
a	1
word	1
or	1
two.	1
"Signor	1
Muscari,"	1
said	1
the	1
cleric,	1
"in	1
this	1
queer	1
crisis	1
personalities	1
may	1
be	1
pardoned.	1
I	1
may	1
tell	1
you	1
without	1
offence	1
of	1
a	1
way	1
in	1
which	1
you	1
will	1
do	1
more	1
good	1
than	1
by	1
helping	1
the	1
gendarmes,	1
who	1
are	1
bound	1
to	1
break	1
through	1
in	1
any	1
case.	1
You	1
will	1
permit	1
me	1
the	1
impertinent	1
intimacy,	1
but	1
do	1
you	1
care	1
about	1
that	1
girl?	1
Care	1
enough	1
to	1
marry	1
her	1
and	1
make	1
her	1
a	1
good	1
husband,	1
I	1
mean?"	1
"Yes,"	1
said	1
the	1
poet	1
quite	1
simply.	1
"Does	1
she	1
care	1
about	1
you?"	1
"I	1
think	1
so,"	1
was	1
the	1
equally	1
grave	1
reply.	1
"Then	1
go	1
over	1
there	1
and	1
offer	1
yourself,"	1
said	1
the	1
priest:	1
"offer	1
her	1
everything	1
you	1
can;	1
offer	1
her	1
heaven	1
and	1
earth	1
if	1
you've	1
got	1
them.	1
The	1
time	1
is	1
short."	1
"Why?"	1
asked	1
the	1
astonished	1
man	1
of	1
letters.	1
"Because,"	1
said	1
Father	1
Brown,	1
"her	1
Doom	1
is	1
coming	1
up	1
the	1
road."	1
"Nothing	1
is	1
coming	1
up	1
the	1
road,"	1
argued	1
Muscari,	1
"except	1
the	1
rescue."	1
"Well,	1
you	1
go	1
over	1
there,"	1
said	1
his	1
adviser,	1
"and	1
be	1
ready	1
to	1
rescue	1
her	1
from	1
the	1
rescue."	1
Almost	1
as	1
he	1
spoke	1
the	1
hedges	1
were	1
broken	1
all	1
along	1
the	1
ridge	1
by	1
a	1
rush	1
of	1
the	1
escaping	1
brigands.	1
They	1
dived	1
into	1
bushes	1
and	1
thick	1
grass	1
like	1
defeated	1
men	1
pursued;	1
and	1
the	1
great	1
cocked	1
hats	1
of	1
the	1
mounted	1
gendarmerie	1
were	1
seen	1
passing	1
along	1
above	1
the	1
broken	1
hedge.	1
Another	1
order	1
was	1
given;	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
noise	1
of	1
dismounting,	1
and	1
a	1
tall	1
officer	1
with	1
cocked	1
hat,	1
a	1
grey	1
imperial,	1
and	1
a	1
paper	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
appeared	1
in	1
the	1
gap	1
that	1
was	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
the	1
Paradise	1
of	1
Thieves.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
momentary	1
silence,	1
broken	1
in	1
an	1
extraordinary	1
way	1
by	1
the	1
banker,	1
who	1
cried	1
out	1
in	1
a	1
hoarse	1
and	1
strangled	1
voice:	1
"Robbed!	1
I've	1
been	1
robbed!"	1
"Why,	1
that	1
was	1
hours	1
ago,"	1
cried	1
his	1
son	1
in	1
astonishment:	1
"when	1
you	1
were	1
robbed	1
of	1
two	1
thousand	1
pounds."	1
"Not	1
of	1
two	1
thousand	1
pounds,"	1
said	1
the	1
financier,	1
with	1
an	1
abrupt	1
and	1
terrible	1
composure,	1
"only	1
of	1
a	1
small	1
bottle."	1
The	1
policeman	1
with	1
the	1
grey	1
imperial	1
was	1
striding	1
across	1
the	1
green	1
hollow.	1
Encountering	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
the	1
Thieves	1
in	1
his	1
path,	1
he	1
clapped	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
shoulder	1
with	1
something	1
between	1
a	1
caress	1
and	1
a	1
buffet	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
push	1
that	1
sent	1
him	1
staggering	1
away.	1
"You'll	1
get	1
into	1
trouble,	1
too,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"if	1
you	1
play	1
these	1
tricks."	1
Again	1
to	1
Muscari's	1
artistic	1
eye	1
it	1
seemed	1
scarcely	1
like	1
the	1
capture	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
outlaw	1
at	1
bay.	1
Passing	1
on,	1
the	1
policeman	1
halted	1
before	1
the	1
Harrogate	1
group	1
and	1
said:	1
"Samuel	1
Harrogate,	1
I	1
arrest	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
for	1
embezzlement	1
of	1
the	1
funds	1
of	1
the	1
Hull	1
and	1
Huddersfield	1
Bank."	1
The	1
great	1
banker	1
nodded	1
with	1
an	1
odd	1
air	1
of	1
business	1
assent,	1
seemed	1
to	1
reflect	1
a	1
moment,	1
and	1
before	1
they	1
could	1
interpose	1
took	1
a	1
half	1
turn	1
and	1
a	1
step	1
that	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
outer	1
mountain	1
wall.	1
Then,	1
flinging	1
up	1
his	1
hands,	1
he	1
leapt	1
exactly	1
as	1
he	1
leapt	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
coach.	1
But	1
this	1
time	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
fall	1
into	1
a	1
little	1
meadow	1
just	1
beneath;	1
he	1
fell	1
a	1
thousand	1
feet	1
below,	1
to	1
become	1
a	1
wreck	1
of	1
bones	1
in	1
the	1
valley.	1
The	1
anger	1
of	1
the	1
Italian	1
policeman,	1
which	1
he	1
expressed	1
volubly	1
to	1
Father	1
Brown,	1
was	1
largely	1
mixed	1
with	1
admiration.	1
"It	1
was	1
like	1
him	1
to	1
escape	1
us	1
at	1
last,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"He	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
brigand	1
if	1
you	1
like.	1
This	1
last	1
trick	1
of	1
his	1
I	1
believe	1
to	1
be	1
absolutely	1
unprecedented.	1
He	1
fled	1
with	1
the	1
company's	1
money	1
to	1
Italy,	1
and	1
actually	1
got	1
himself	1
captured	1
by	1
sham	1
brigands	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
pay,	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
explain	1
both	1
the	1
disappearance	1
of	1
the	1
money	1
and	1
the	1
disappearance	1
of	1
himself.	1
That	1
demand	1
for	1
ransom	1
was	1
really	1
taken	1
seriously	1
by	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
police.	1
But	1
for	1
years	1
he's	1
been	1
doing	1
things	1
as	1
good	1
as	1
that,	1
quite	1
as	1
good	1
as	1
that.	1
He	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
serious	1
loss	1
to	1
his	1
family."	1
Muscari	1
was	1
leading	1
away	1
the	1
unhappy	1
daughter,	1
who	1
held	1
hard	1
to	1
him,	1
as	1
she	1
did	1
for	1
many	1
a	1
year	1
after.	1
But	1
even	1
in	1
that	1
tragic	1
wreck	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
having	1
a	1
smile	1
and	1
a	1
hand	1
of	1
half-mocking	1
friendship	1
for	1
the	1
indefensible	1
Ezza	1
Montano.	1
"And	1
where	1
are	1
you	1
going	1
next?"	1
he	1
asked	1
him	1
over	1
his	1
shoulder.	1
"Birmingham,"	1
answered	1
the	1
actor,	1
puffing	1
a	1
cigarette.	1
"Didn't	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
Futurist?	1
I	1
really	1
do	1
believe	1
in	1
those	1
things	1
if	1
I	1
believe	1
in	1
anything.	1
Change,	1
bustle	1
and	1
new	1
things	1
every	1
morning.	1
I	1
am	1
going	1
to	1
Manchester,	1
Liverpool,	1
Leeds,	1
Hull,	1
Huddersfield,	1
Glasgow,	1
Chicago--in	1
short,	1
to	1
enlightened,	1
energetic,	1
civilized	1
society!"	1
"In	1
short,"	1
said	1
Muscari,	1
"to	1
the	1
real	1
Paradise	1
of	1
Thieves."	1
III.	1
The	1
Duel	1
of	1
Dr	1
Hirsch	1
M.	1
MAURICE	1
BRUN	1
and	1
M.	1
Armand	1
Armagnac	1
were	1
crossing	1
the	1
sunlit	1
Champs	1
Elysee	1
with	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
vivacious	1
respectability.	1
They	1
were	1
both	1
short,	1
brisk	1
and	1
bold.	1
They	1
both	1
had	1
black	1
beards	1
that	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
belong	1
to	1
their	1
faces,	1
after	1
the	1
strange	1
French	1
fashion	1
which	1
makes	1
real	1
hair	1
look	1
like	1
artificial.	1
M.	1
Brun	1
had	1
a	1
dark	1
wedge	1
of	1
beard	1
apparently	1
affixed	1
under	1
his	1
lower	1
lip.	1
M.	1
Armagnac,	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
a	1
change,	1
had	1
two	1
beards;	1
one	1
sticking	1
out	1
from	1
each	1
corner	1
of	1
his	1
emphatic	1
chin.	1
They	1
were	1
both	1
young.	1
They	1
were	1
both	1
atheists,	1
with	1
a	1
depressing	1
fixity	1
of	1
outlook	1
but	1
great	1
mobility	1
of	1
exposition.	1
They	1
were	1
both	1
pupils	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
Dr	1
Hirsch,	1
scientist,	1
publicist	1
and	1
moralist.	1
M.	1
Brun	1
had	1
become	1
prominent	1
by	1
his	1
proposal	1
that	1
the	1
common	1
expression	1
"Adieu"	1
should	1
be	1
obliterated	1
from	1
all	1
the	1
French	1
classics,	1
and	1
a	1
slight	1
fine	1
imposed	1
for	1
its	1
use	1
in	1
private	1
life.	1
"Then,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"the	1
very	1
name	1
of	1
your	1
imagined	1
God	1
will	1
have	1
echoed	1
for	1
the	1
last	1
time	1
in	1
the	1
ear	1
of	1
man."	1
M.	1
Armagnac	1
specialized	1
rather	1
in	1
a	1
resistance	1
to	1
militarism,	1
and	1
wished	1
the	1
chorus	1
of	1
the	1
Marseillaise	1
altered	1
from	1
"Aux	1
armes,	1
citoyens"	1
to	1
"Aux	1
greves,	1
citoyens".	1
But	1
his	1
antimilitarism	1
was	1
of	1
a	1
peculiar	1
and	1
Gallic	1
sort.	1
An	1
eminent	1
and	1
very	1
wealthy	1
English	1
Quaker,	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
to	1
arrange	1
for	1
the	1
disarmament	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
planet,	1
was	1
rather	1
distressed	1
by	1
Armagnac's	1
proposal	1
that	1
(by	1
way	1
of	1
beginning)	1
the	1
soldiers	1
should	1
shoot	1
their	1
officers.	1
And	1
indeed	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
this	1
regard	1
that	1
the	1
two	1
men	1
differed	1
most	1
from	1
their	1
leader	1
and	1
father	1
in	1
philosophy.	1
Dr	1
Hirsch,	1
though	1
born	1
in	1
France	1
and	1
covered	1
with	1
the	1
most	1
triumphant	1
favours	1
of	1
French	1
education,	1
was	1
temperamentally	1
of	1
another	1
type--mild,	1
dreamy,	1
humane;	1
and,	1
despite	1
his	1
sceptical	1
system,	1
not	1
devoid	1
of	1
transcendentalism.	1
He	1
was,	1
in	1
short,	1
more	1
like	1
a	1
German	1
than	1
a	1
Frenchman;	1
and	1
much	1
as	1
they	1
admired	1
him,	1
something	1
in	1
the	1
subconsciousness	1
of	1
these	1
Gauls	1
was	1
irritated	1
at	1
his	1
pleading	1
for	1
peace	1
in	1
so	1
peaceful	1
a	1
manner.	1
To	1
their	1
party	1
throughout	1
Europe,	1
however,	1
Paul	1
Hirsch	1
was	1
a	1
saint	1
of	1
science.	1
His	1
large	1
and	1
daring	1
cosmic	1
theories	1
advertised	1
his	1
austere	1
life	1
and	1
innocent,	1
if	1
somewhat	1
frigid,	1
morality;	1
he	1
held	1
something	1
of	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
Darwin	1
doubled	1
with	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
Tolstoy.	1
But	1
he	1
was	1
neither	1
an	1
anarchist	1
nor	1
an	1
antipatriot;	1
his	1
views	1
on	1
disarmament	1
were	1
moderate	1
and	1
evolutionary--	1
the	1
Republican	1
Government	1
put	1
considerable	1
confidence	1
in	1
him	1
as	1
to	1
various	1
chemical	1
improvements.	1
He	1
had	1
lately	1
even	1
discovered	1
a	1
noiseless	1
explosive,	1
the	1
secret	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
Government	1
was	1
carefully	1
guarding.	1
His	1
house	1
stood	1
in	1
a	1
handsome	1
street	1
near	1
the	1
Elysee--	1
a	1
street	1
which	1
in	1
that	1
strong	1
summer	1
seemed	1
almost	1
as	1
full	1
of	1
foliage	1
as	1
the	1
park	1
itself;	1
a	1
row	1
of	1
chestnuts	1
shattered	1
the	1
sunshine,	1
interrupted	1
only	1
in	1
one	1
place	1
where	1
a	1
large	1
cafe	1
ran	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
street.	1
Almost	1
opposite	1
to	1
this	1
were	1
the	1
white	1
and	1
green	1
blinds	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
scientist's	1
house,	1
an	1
iron	1
balcony,	1
also	1
painted	1
green,	1
running	1
along	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
first-floor	1
windows.	1
Beneath	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
entrance	1
into	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
court,	1
gay	1
with	1
shrubs	1
and	1
tiles,	1
into	1
which	1
the	1
two	1
Frenchmen	1
passed	1
in	1
animated	1
talk.	1
The	1
door	1
was	1
opened	1
to	1
them	1
by	1
the	1
doctor's	1
old	1
servant,	1
Simon,	1
who	1
might	1
very	1
well	1
have	1
passed	1
for	1
a	1
doctor	1
himself,	1
having	1
a	1
strict	1
suit	1
of	1
black,	1
spectacles,	1
grey	1
hair,	1
and	1
a	1
confidential	1
manner.	1
In	1
fact,	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
far	1
more	1
presentable	1
man	1
of	1
science	1
than	1
his	1
master,	1
Dr	1
Hirsch,	1
who	1
was	1
a	1
forked	1
radish	1
of	1
a	1
fellow,	1
with	1
just	1
enough	1
bulb	1
of	1
a	1
head	1
to	1
make	1
his	1
body	1
insignificant.	1
With	1
all	1
the	1
gravity	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
physician	1
handling	1
a	1
prescription,	1
Simon	1
handed	1
a	1
letter	1
to	1
M.	1
Armagnac.	1
That	1
gentleman	1
ripped	1
it	1
up	1
with	1
a	1
racial	1
impatience,	1
and	1
rapidly	1
read	1
the	1
following:	1
I	1
cannot	1
come	1
down	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
you.	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
this	1
house	1
whom	1
I	1
refuse	1
to	1
meet.	1
He	1
is	1
a	1
Chauvinist	1
officer,	1
Dubosc.	1
He	1
is	1
sitting	1
on	1
the	1
stairs.	1
He	1
has	1
been	1
kicking	1
the	1
furniture	1
about	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
other	1
rooms;	1
I	1
have	1
locked	1
myself	1
in	1
my	1
study,	1
opposite	1
that	1
cafe.	1
If	1
you	1
love	1
me,	1
go	1
over	1
to	1
the	1
cafe	1
and	1
wait	1
at	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
tables	1
outside.	1
I	1
will	1
try	1
to	1
send	1
him	1
over	1
to	1
you.	1
I	1
want	1
you	1
to	1
answer	1
him	1
and	1
deal	1
with	1
him.	1
I	1
cannot	1
meet	1
him	1
myself.	1
I	1
cannot:	1
I	1
will	1
not.	1
There	1
is	1
going	1
to	1
be	1
another	1
Dreyfus	1
case.	1
P.	1
HIRSCH	1
M.	1
Armagnac	1
looked	1
at	1
M.	1
Brun.	1
M.	1
Brun	1
borrowed	1
the	1
letter,	1
read	1
it,	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
M.	1
Armagnac.	1
Then	1
both	1
betook	1
themselves	1
briskly	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
tables	1
under	1
the	1
chestnuts	1
opposite,	1
where	1
they	1
procured	1
two	1
tall	1
glasses	1
of	1
horrible	1
green	1
absinthe,	1
which	1
they	1
could	1
drink	1
apparently	1
in	1
any	1
weather	1
and	1
at	1
any	1
time.	1
Otherwise	1
the	1
cafe	1
seemed	1
empty,	1
except	1
for	1
one	1
soldier	1
drinking	1
coffee	1
at	1
one	1
table,	1
and	1
at	1
another	1
a	1
large	1
man	1
drinking	1
a	1
small	1
syrup	1
and	1
a	1
priest	1
drinking	1
nothing.	1
Maurice	1
Brun	1
cleared	1
his	1
throat	1
and	1
said:	1
"Of	1
course	1
we	1
must	1
help	1
the	1
master	1
in	1
every	1
way,	1
but--"	1
There	1
was	1
an	1
abrupt	1
silence,	1
and	1
Armagnac	1
said:	1
"He	1
may	1
have	1
excellent	1
reasons	1
for	1
not	1
meeting	1
the	1
man	1
himself,	1
but--"	1
Before	1
either	1
could	1
complete	1
a	1
sentence,	1
it	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
the	1
invader	1
had	1
been	1
expelled	1
from	1
the	1
house	1
opposite.	1
The	1
shrubs	1
under	1
the	1
archway	1
swayed	1
and	1
burst	1
apart,	1
as	1
that	1
unwelcome	1
guest	1
was	1
shot	1
out	1
of	1
them	1
like	1
a	1
cannon-ball.	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
sturdy	1
figure	1
in	1
a	1
small	1
and	1
tilted	1
Tyrolean	1
felt	1
hat,	1
a	1
figure	1
that	1
had	1
indeed	1
something	1
generally	1
Tyrolean	1
about	1
it.	1
The	1
man's	1
shoulders	1
were	1
big	1
and	1
broad,	1
but	1
his	1
legs	1
were	1
neat	1
and	1
active	1
in	1
knee-breeches	1
and	1
knitted	1
stockings.	1
His	1
face	1
was	1
brown	1
like	1
a	1
nut;	1
he	1
had	1
very	1
bright	1
and	1
restless	1
brown	1
eyes;	1
his	1
dark	1
hair	1
was	1
brushed	1
back	1
stiffly	1
in	1
front	1
and	1
cropped	1
close	1
behind,	1
outlining	1
a	1
square	1
and	1
powerful	1
skull;	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
huge	1
black	1
moustache	1
like	1
the	1
horns	1
of	1
a	1
bison.	1
Such	1
a	1
substantial	1
head	1
is	1
generally	1
based	1
on	1
a	1
bull	1
neck;	1
but	1
this	1
was	1
hidden	1
by	1
a	1
big	1
coloured	1
scarf,	1
swathed	1
round	1
up	1
the	1
man's	1
ears	1
and	1
falling	1
in	1
front	1
inside	1
his	1
jacket	1
like	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
fancy	1
waistcoat.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
scarf	1
of	1
strong	1
dead	1
colours,	1
dark	1
red	1
and	1
old	1
gold	1
and	1
purple,	1
probably	1
of	1
Oriental	1
fabrication.	1
Altogether	1
the	1
man	1
had	1
something	1
a	1
shade	1
barbaric	1
about	1
him;	1
more	1
like	1
a	1
Hungarian	1
squire	1
than	1
an	1
ordinary	1
French	1
officer.	1
His	1
French,	1
however,	1
was	1
obviously	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
native;	1
and	1
his	1
French	1
patriotism	1
was	1
so	1
impulsive	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
slightly	1
absurd.	1
His	1
first	1
act	1
when	1
he	1
burst	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
archway	1
was	1
to	1
call	1
in	1
a	1
clarion	1
voice	1
down	1
the	1
street:	1
"Are	1
there	1
any	1
Frenchmen	1
here?"	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
calling	1
for	1
Christians	1
in	1
Mecca.	1
Armagnac	1
and	1
Brun	1
instantly	1
stood	1
up;	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
too	1
late.	1
Men	1
were	1
already	1
running	1
from	1
the	1
street	1
corners;	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
small	1
but	1
ever-clustering	1
crowd.	1
With	1
the	1
prompt	1
French	1
instinct	1
for	1
the	1
politics	1
of	1
the	1
street,	1
the	1
man	1
with	1
the	1
black	1
moustache	1
had	1
already	1
run	1
across	1
to	1
a	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
cafe,	1
sprung	1
on	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
tables,	1
and	1
seizing	1
a	1
branch	1
of	1
chestnut	1
to	1
steady	1
himself,	1
shouted	1
as	1
Camille	1
Desmoulins	1
once	1
shouted	1
when	1
he	1
scattered	1
the	1
oak-leaves	1
among	1
the	1
populace.	1
"Frenchmen!"	1
he	1
volleyed;	1
"I	1
cannot	1
speak!	1
God	1
help	1
me,	1
that	1
is	1
why	1
I	1
am	1
speaking!	1
The	1
fellows	1
in	1
their	1
filthy	1
parliaments	1
who	1
learn	1
to	1
speak	1
also	1
learn	1
to	1
be	1
silent--silent	1
as	1
that	1
spy	1
cowering	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
opposite!	1
Silent	1
as	1
he	1
is	1
when	1
I	1
beat	1
on	1
his	1
bedroom	1
door!	1
Silent	1
as	1
he	1
is	1
now,	1
though	1
he	1
hears	1
my	1
voice	1
across	1
this	1
street	1
and	1
shakes	1
where	1
he	1
sits!	1
Oh,	1
they	1
can	1
be	1
silent	1
eloquently--	1
the	1
politicians!	1
But	1
the	1
time	1
has	1
come	1
when	1
we	1
that	1
cannot	1
speak	1
must	1
speak.	1
You	1
are	1
betrayed	1
to	1
the	1
Prussians.	1
Betrayed	1
at	1
this	1
moment.	1
Betrayed	1
by	1
that	1
man.	1
I	1
am	1
Jules	1
Dubosc,	1
Colonel	1
of	1
Artillery,	1
Belfort.	1
We	1
caught	1
a	1
German	1
spy	1
in	1
the	1
Vosges	1
yesterday,	1
and	1
a	1
paper	1
was	1
found	1
on	1
him--a	1
paper	1
I	1
hold	1
in	1
my	1
hand.	1
Oh,	1
they	1
tried	1
to	1
hush	1
it	1
up;	1
but	1
I	1
took	1
it	1
direct	1
to	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
wrote	1
it--the	1
man	1
in	1
that	1
house!	1
It	1
is	1
in	1
his	1
hand.	1
It	1
is	1
signed	1
with	1
his	1
initials.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
direction	1
for	1
finding	1
the	1
secret	1
of	1
this	1
new	1
Noiseless	1
Powder.	1
Hirsch	1
invented	1
it;	1
Hirsch	1
wrote	1
this	1
note	1
about	1
it.	1
This	1
note	1
is	1
in	1
German,	1
and	1
was	1
found	1
in	1
a	1
German's	1
pocket.	1
`Tell	1
the	1
man	1
the	1
formula	1
for	1
powder	1
is	1
in	1
grey	1
envelope	1
in	1
first	1
drawer	1
to	1
the	1
left	1
of	1
Secretary's	1
desk,	1
War	1
Office,	1
in	1
red	1
ink.	1
He	1
must	1
be	1
careful.	1
P.H.'"	1
He	1
rattled	1
short	1
sentences	1
like	1
a	1
quick-firing	1
gun,	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
plainly	1
the	1
sort	1
of	1
man	1
who	1
is	1
either	1
mad	1
or	1
right.	1
The	1
mass	1
of	1
the	1
crowd	1
was	1
Nationalist,	1
and	1
already	1
in	1
threatening	1
uproar;	1
and	1
a	1
minority	1
of	1
equally	1
angry	1
Intellectuals,	1
led	1
by	1
Armagnac	1
and	1
Brun,	1
only	1
made	1
the	1
majority	1
more	1
militant.	1
"If	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
military	1
secret,"	1
shouted	1
Brun,	1
"why	1
do	1
you	1
yell	1
about	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
street?"	1
"I	1
will	1
tell	1
you	1
why	1
I	1
do!"	1
roared	1
Dubosc	1
above	1
the	1
roaring	1
crowd.	1
"I	1
went	1
to	1
this	1
man	1
in	1
straight	1
and	1
civil	1
style.	1
If	1
he	1
had	1
any	1
explanation	1
it	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
given	1
in	1
complete	1
confidence.	1
He	1
refuses	1
to	1
explain.	1
He	1
refers	1
me	1
to	1
two	1
strangers	1
in	1
a	1
cafe	1
as	1
to	1
two	1
flunkeys.	1
He	1
has	1
thrown	1
me	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
going	1
back	1
into	1
it,	1
with	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Paris	1
behind	1
me!"	1
A	1
shout	1
seemed	1
to	1
shake	1
the	1
very	1
facade	1
of	1
mansions	1
and	1
two	1
stones	1
flew,	1
one	1
breaking	1
a	1
window	1
above	1
the	1
balcony.	1
The	1
indignant	1
Colonel	1
plunged	1
once	1
more	1
under	1
the	1
archway	1
and	1
was	1
heard	1
crying	1
and	1
thundering	1
inside.	1
Every	1
instant	1
the	1
human	1
sea	1
grew	1
wider	1
and	1
wider;	1
it	1
surged	1
up	1
against	1
the	1
rails	1
and	1
steps	1
of	1
the	1
traitor's	1
house;	1
it	1
was	1
already	1
certain	1
that	1
the	1
place	1
would	1
be	1
burst	1
into	1
like	1
the	1
Bastille,	1
when	1
the	1
broken	1
french	1
window	1
opened	1
and	1
Dr	1
Hirsch	1
came	1
out	1
on	1
the	1
balcony.	1
For	1
an	1
instant	1
the	1
fury	1
half	1
turned	1
to	1
laughter;	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
an	1
absurd	1
figure	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
scene.	1
His	1
long	1
bare	1
neck	1
and	1
sloping	1
shoulders	1
were	1
the	1
shape	1
of	1
a	1
champagne	1
bottle,	1
but	1
that	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
festive	1
thing	1
about	1
him.	1
His	1
coat	1
hung	1
on	1
him	1
as	1
on	1
a	1
peg;	1
he	1
wore	1
his	1
carrot-coloured	1
hair	1
long	1
and	1
weedy;	1
his	1
cheeks	1
and	1
chin	1
were	1
fully	1
fringed	1
with	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
irritating	1
beards	1
that	1
begin	1
far	1
from	1
the	1
mouth.	1
He	1
was	1
very	1
pale,	1
and	1
he	1
wore	1
blue	1
spectacles.	1
Livid	1
as	1
he	1
was,	1
he	1
spoke	1
with	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
prim	1
decision,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
mob	1
fell	1
silent	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
his	1
third	1
sentence.	1
"...only	1
two	1
things	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
you	1
now.	1
The	1
first	1
is	1
to	1
my	1
foes,	1
the	1
second	1
to	1
my	1
friends.	1
To	1
my	1
foes	1
I	1
say:	1
It	1
is	1
true	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
meet	1
M.	1
Dubosc,	1
though	1
he	1
is	1
storming	1
outside	1
this	1
very	1
room.	1
It	1
is	1
true	1
I	1
have	1
asked	1
two	1
other	1
men	1
to	1
confront	1
him	1
for	1
me.	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
you	1
why!	1
Because	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
and	1
must	1
not	1
see	1
him--	1
because	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
against	1
all	1
rules	1
of	1
dignity	1
and	1
honour	1
to	1
see	1
him.	1
Before	1
I	1
am	1
triumphantly	1
cleared	1
before	1
a	1
court,	1
there	1
is	1
another	1
arbitration	1
this	1
gentleman	1
owes	1
me	1
as	1
a	1
gentleman,	1
and	1
in	1
referring	1
him	1
to	1
my	1
seconds	1
I	1
am	1
strictly--"	1
Armagnac	1
and	1
Brun	1
were	1
waving	1
their	1
hats	1
wildly,	1
and	1
even	1
the	1
Doctor's	1
enemies	1
roared	1
applause	1
at	1
this	1
unexpected	1
defiance.	1
Once	1
more	1
a	1
few	1
sentences	1
were	1
inaudible,	1
but	1
they	1
could	1
hear	1
him	1
say:	1
"To	1
my	1
friends--I	1
myself	1
should	1
always	1
prefer	1
weapons	1
purely	1
intellectual,	1
and	1
to	1
these	1
an	1
evolved	1
humanity	1
will	1
certainly	1
confine	1
itself.	1
But	1
our	1
own	1
most	1
precious	1
truth	1
is	1
the	1
fundamental	1
force	1
of	1
matter	1
and	1
heredity.	1
My	1
books	1
are	1
successful;	1
my	1
theories	1
are	1
unrefuted;	1
but	1
I	1
suffer	1
in	1
politics	1
from	1
a	1
prejudice	1
almost	1
physical	1
in	1
the	1
French.	1
I	1
cannot	1
speak	1
like	1
Clemenceau	1
and	1
Deroulede,	1
for	1
their	1
words	1
are	1
like	1
echoes	1
of	1
their	1
pistols.	1
The	1
French	1
ask	1
for	1
a	1
duellist	1
as	1
the	1
English	1
ask	1
for	1
a	1
sportsman.	1
Well,	1
I	1
give	1
my	1
proofs:	1
I	1
will	1
pay	1
this	1
barbaric	1
bribe,	1
and	1
then	1
go	1
back	1
to	1
reason	1
for	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
my	1
life."	1
Two	1
men	1
were	1
instantly	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
crowd	1
itself	1
to	1
offer	1
their	1
services	1
to	1
Colonel	1
Dubosc,	1
who	1
came	1
out	1
presently,	1
satisfied.	1
One	1
was	1
the	1
common	1
soldier	1
with	1
the	1
coffee,	1
who	1
said	1
simply:	1
"I	1
will	1
act	1
for	1
you,	1
sir.	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
Duc	1
de	1
Valognes."	1
The	1
other	1
was	1
the	1
big	1
man,	1
whom	1
his	1
friend	1
the	1
priest	1
sought	1
at	1
first	1
to	1
dissuade;	1
and	1
then	1
walked	1
away	1
alone.	1
In	1
the	1
early	1
evening	1
a	1
light	1
dinner	1
was	1
spread	1
at	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
the	1
Cafe	1
Charlemagne.	1
Though	1
unroofed	1
by	1
any	1
glass	1
or	1
gilt	1
plaster,	1
the	1
guests	1
were	1
nearly	1
all	1
under	1
a	1
delicate	1
and	1
irregular	1
roof	1
of	1
leaves;	1
for	1
the	1
ornamental	1
trees	1
stood	1
so	1
thick	1
around	1
and	1
among	1
the	1
tables	1
as	1
to	1
give	1
something	1
of	1
the	1
dimness	1
and	1
the	1
dazzle	1
of	1
a	1
small	1
orchard.	1
At	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
central	1
tables	1
a	1
very	1
stumpy	1
little	1
priest	1
sat	1
in	1
complete	1
solitude,	1
and	1
applied	1
himself	1
to	1
a	1
pile	1
of	1
whitebait	1
with	1
the	1
gravest	1
sort	1
of	1
enjoyment.	1
His	1
daily	1
living	1
being	1
very	1
plain,	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
peculiar	1
taste	1
for	1
sudden	1
and	1
isolated	1
luxuries;	1
he	1
was	1
an	1
abstemious	1
epicure.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
lift	1
his	1
eyes	1
from	1
his	1
plate,	1
round	1
which	1
red	1
pepper,	1
lemons,	1
brown	1
bread	1
and	1
butter,	1
etc.,	1
were	1
rigidly	1
ranked,	1
until	1
a	1
tall	1
shadow	1
fell	1
across	1
the	1
table,	1
and	1
his	1
friend	1
Flambeau	1
sat	1
down	1
opposite.	1
Flambeau	1
was	1
gloomy.	1
"I'm	1
afraid	1
I	1
must	1
chuck	1
this	1
business,"	1
said	1
he	1
heavily.	1
"I'm	1
all	1
on	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
soldiers	1
like	1
Dubosc,	1
and	1
I'm	1
all	1
against	1
the	1
French	1
atheists	1
like	1
Hirsch;	1
but	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
in	1
this	1
case	1
we've	1
made	1
a	1
mistake.	1
The	1
Duke	1
and	1
I	1
thought	1
it	1
as	1
well	1
to	1
investigate	1
the	1
charge,	1
and	1
I	1
must	1
say	1
I'm	1
glad	1
we	1
did."	1
"Is	1
the	1
paper	1
a	1
forgery,	1
then?"	1
asked	1
the	1
priest	1
"That's	1
just	1
the	1
odd	1
thing,"	1
replied	1
Flambeau.	1
"It's	1
exactly	1
like	1
Hirsch's	1
writing,	1
and	1
nobody	1
can	1
point	1
out	1
any	1
mistake	1
in	1
it.	1
But	1
it	1
wasn't	1
written	1
by	1
Hirsch.	1
If	1
he's	1
a	1
French	1
patriot	1
he	1
didn't	1
write	1
it,	1
because	1
it	1
gives	1
information	1
to	1
Germany.	1
And	1
if	1
he's	1
a	1
German	1
spy	1
he	1
didn't	1
write	1
it,	1
well--because	1
it	1
doesn't	1
give	1
information	1
to	1
Germany."	1
"You	1
mean	1
the	1
information	1
is	1
wrong?"	1
asked	1
Father	1
Brown.	1
"Wrong,"	1
replied	1
the	1
other,	1
"and	1
wrong	1
exactly	1
where	1
Dr	1
Hirsch	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
right--about	1
the	1
hiding-place	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
secret	1
formula	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
official	1
department.	1
By	1
favour	1
of	1
Hirsch	1
and	1
the	1
authorities,	1
the	1
Duke	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
actually	1
been	1
allowed	1
to	1
inspect	1
the	1
secret	1
drawer	1
at	1
the	1
War	1
Office	1
where	1
the	1
Hirsch	1
formula	1
is	1
kept.	1
We	1
are	1
the	1
only	1
people	1
who	1
have	1
ever	1
known	1
it,	1
except	1
the	1
inventor	1
himself	1
and	1
the	1
Minister	1
for	1
War;	1
but	1
the	1
Minister	1
permitted	1
it	1
to	1
save	1
Hirsch	1
from	1
fighting.	1
After	1
that	1
we	1
really	1
can't	1
support	1
Dubosc	1
if	1
his	1
revelation	1
is	1
a	1
mare's	1
nest."	1
"And	1
it	1
is?"	1
asked	1
Father	1
Brown.	1
"It	1
is,"	1
said	1
his	1
friend	1
gloomily.	1
"It	1
is	1
a	1
clumsy	1
forgery	1
by	1
somebody	1
who	1
knew	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
real	1
hiding-place.	1
It	1
says	1
the	1
paper	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
cupboard	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
of	1
the	1
Secretary's	1
desk.	1
As	1
a	1
fact	1
the	1
cupboard	1
with	1
the	1
secret	1
drawer	1
is	1
some	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
left	1
of	1
the	1
desk.	1
It	1
says	1
the	1
grey	1
envelope	1
contains	1
a	1
long	1
document	1
written	1
in	1
red	1
ink.	1
It	1
isn't	1
written	1
in	1
red	1
ink,	1
but	1
in	1
ordinary	1
black	1
ink.	1
It's	1
manifestly	1
absurd	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
Hirsch	1
can	1
have	1
made	1
a	1
mistake	1
about	1
a	1
paper	1
that	1
nobody	1
knew	1
of	1
but	1
himself;	1
or	1
can	1
have	1
tried	1
to	1
help	1
a	1
foreign	1
thief	1
by	1
telling	1
him	1
to	1
fumble	1
in	1
the	1
wrong	1
drawer.	1
I	1
think	1
we	1
must	1
chuck	1
it	1
up	1
and	1
apologize	1
to	1
old	1
Carrots."	1
Father	1
Brown	1
seemed	1
to	1
cogitate;	1
he	1
lifted	1
a	1
little	1
whitebait	1
on	1
his	1
fork.	1
"You	1
are	1
sure	1
the	1
grey	1
envelope	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
left	1
cupboard?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
"Positive,"	1
replied	1
Flambeau.	1
"The	1
grey	1
envelope--	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
white	1
envelope	1
really--was--"	1
Father	1
Brown	1
put	1
down	1
the	1
small	1
silver	1
fish	1
and	1
the	1
fork	1
and	1
stared	1
across	1
at	1
his	1
companion.	1
"What?"	1
he	1
asked,	1
in	1
an	1
altered	1
voice.	1
"Well,	1
what?"	1
repeated	1
Flambeau,	1
eating	1
heartily.	1
"It	1
was	1
not	1
grey,"	1
said	1
the	1
priest.	1
"Flambeau,	1
you	1
frighten	1
me."	1
"What	1
the	1
deuce	1
are	1
you	1
frightened	1
of?"	1
"I'm	1
frightened	1
of	1
a	1
white	1
envelope,"	1
said	1
the	1
other	1
seriously,	1
"If	1
it	1
had	1
only	1
just	1
been	1
grey!	1
Hang	1
it	1
all,	1
it	1
might	1
as	1
well	1
have	1
been	1
grey.	1
But	1
if	1
it	1
was	1
white,	1
the	1
whole	1
business	1
is	1
black.	1
The	1
Doctor	1
has	1
been	1
dabbling	1
in	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
brimstone	1
after	1
all."	1
"But	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
he	1
couldn't	1
have	1
written	1
such	1
a	1
note!"	1
cried	1
Flambeau.	1
"The	1
note	1
is	1
utterly	1
wrong	1
about	1
the	1
facts.	1
And	1
innocent	1
or	1
guilty,	1
Dr	1
Hirsch	1
knew	1
all	1
about	1
the	1
facts."	1
"The	1
man	1
who	1
wrote	1
that	1
note	1
knew	1
all	1
about	1
the	1
facts,"	1
said	1
his	1
clerical	1
companion	1
soberly.	1
"He	1
could	1
never	1
have	1
got	1
'em	1
so	1
wrong	1
without	1
knowing	1
about	1
'em.	1
You	1
have	1
to	1
know	1
an	1
awful	1
lot	1
to	1
be	1
wrong	1
on	1
every	1
subject--like	1
the	1
devil."	1
"Do	1
you	1
mean--?"	1
"I	1
mean	1
a	1
man	1
telling	1
lies	1
on	1
chance	1
would	1
have	1
told	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
truth,"	1
said	1
his	1
friend	1
firmly.	1
"Suppose	1
someone	1
sent	1
you	1
to	1
find	1
a	1
house	1
with	1
a	1
green	1
door	1
and	1
a	1
blue	1
blind,	1
with	1
a	1
front	1
garden	1
but	1
no	1
back	1
garden,	1
with	1
a	1
dog	1
but	1
no	1
cat,	1
and	1
where	1
they	1
drank	1
coffee	1
but	1
not	1
tea.	1
You	1
would	1
say	1
if	1
you	1
found	1
no	1
such	1
house	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
made	1
up.	1
But	1
I	1
say	1
no.	1
I	1
say	1
if	1
you	1
found	1
a	1
house	1
where	1
the	1
door	1
was	1
blue	1
and	1
the	1
blind	1
green,	1
where	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
back	1
garden	1
and	1
no	1
front	1
garden,	1
where	1
cats	1
were	1
common	1
and	1
dogs	1
instantly	1
shot,	1
where	1
tea	1
was	1
drunk	1
in	1
quarts	1
and	1
coffee	1
forbidden--then	1
you	1
would	1
know	1
you	1
had	1
found	1
the	1
house.	1
The	1
man	1
must	1
have	1
known	1
that	1
particular	1
house	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
accurately	1
inaccurate."	1
"But	1
what	1
could	1
it	1
mean?"	1
demanded	1
the	1
diner	1
opposite.	1
"I	1
can't	1
conceive,"	1
said	1
Brown;	1
"I	1
don't	1
understand	1
this	1
Hirsch	1
affair	1
at	1
all.	1
As	1
long	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
the	1
left	1
drawer	1
instead	1
of	1
the	1
right,	1
and	1
red	1
ink	1
instead	1
of	1
black,	1
I	1
thought	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
the	1
chance	1
blunders	1
of	1
a	1
forger,	1
as	1
you	1
say.	1
But	1
three	1
is	1
a	1
mystical	1
number;	1
it	1
finishes	1
things.	1
It	1
finishes	1
this.	1
That	1
the	1
direction	1
about	1
the	1
drawer,	1
the	1
colour	1
of	1
ink,	1
the	1
colour	1
of	1
envelope,	1
should	1
none	1
of	1
them	1
be	1
right	1
by	1
accident,	1
that	1
can't	1
be	1
a	1
coincidence.	1
It	1
wasn't."	1
"What	1
was	1
it,	1
then?	1
Treason?"	1
asked	1
Flambeau,	1
resuming	1
his	1
dinner.	1
"I	1
don't	1
know	1
that	1
either,"	1
answered	1
Brown,	1
with	1
a	1
face	1
of	1
blank	1
bewilderment.	1
"The	1
only	1
thing	1
I	1
can	1
think	1
of....	1
Well,	1
I	1
never	1
understood	1
that	1
Dreyfus	1
case.	1
I	1
can	1
always	1
grasp	1
moral	1
evidence	1
easier	1
than	1
the	1
other	1
sorts.	1
I	1
go	1
by	1
a	1
man's	1
eyes	1
and	1
voice,	1
don't	1
you	1
know,	1
and	1
whether	1
his	1
family	1
seems	1
happy,	1
and	1
by	1
what	1
subjects	1
he	1
chooses--and	1
avoids.	1
Well,	1
I	1
was	1
puzzled	1
in	1
the	1
Dreyfus	1
case.	1
Not	1
by	1
the	1
horrible	1
things	1
imputed	1
both	1
ways;	1
I	1
know	1
(though	1
it's	1
not	1
modern	1
to	1
say	1
so)	1
that	1
human	1
nature	1
in	1
the	1
highest	1
places	1
is	1
still	1
capable	1
of	1
being	1
Cenci	1
or	1
Borgia.	1
No--,	1
what	1
puzzled	1
me	1
was	1
the	1
sincerity	1
of	1
both	1
parties.	1
I	1
don't	1
mean	1
the	1
political	1
parties;	1
the	1
rank	1
and	1
file	1
are	1
always	1
roughly	1
honest,	1
and	1
often	1
duped.	1
I	1
mean	1
the	1
persons	1
of	1
the	1
play.	1
I	1
mean	1
the	1
conspirators,	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
conspirators.	1
I	1
mean	1
the	1
traitor,	1
if	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
traitor.	1
I	1
mean	1
the	1
men	1
who	1
must	1
have	1
known	1
the	1
truth.	1
Now	1
Dreyfus	1
went	1
on	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
knew	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
wronged	1
man.	1
And	1
yet	1
the	1
French	1
statesmen	1
and	1
soldiers	1
went	1
on	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
knew	1
he	1
wasn't	1
a	1
wronged	1
man	1
but	1
simply	1
a	1
wrong	1
'un.	1
I	1
don't	1
mean	1
they	1
behaved	1
well;	1
I	1
mean	1
they	1
behaved	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
sure.	1
I	1
can't	1
describe	1
these	1
things;	1
I	1
know	1
what	1
I	1
mean."	1
"I	1
wish	1
I	1
did,"	1
said	1
his	1
friend.	1
"And	1
what	1
has	1
it	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
old	1
Hirsch?"	1
"Suppose	1
a	1
person	1
in	1
a	1
position	1
of	1
trust,"	1
went	1
on	1
the	1
priest,	1
"began	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
enemy	1
information	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
false	1
information.	1
Suppose	1
he	1
even	1
thought	1
he	1
was	1
saving	1
his	1
country	1
by	1
misleading	1
the	1
foreigner.	1
Suppose	1
this	1
brought	1
him	1
into	1
spy	1
circles,	1
and	1
little	1
loans	1
were	1
made	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
little	1
ties	1
tied	1
on	1
to	1
him.	1
Suppose	1
he	1
kept	1
up	1
his	1
contradictory	1
position	1
in	1
a	1
confused	1
way	1
by	1
never	1
telling	1
the	1
foreign	1
spies	1
the	1
truth,	1
but	1
letting	1
it	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
be	1
guessed.	1
The	1
better	1
part	1
of	1
him	1
(what	1
was	1
left	1
of	1
it)	1
would	1
still	1
say:	1
`I	1
have	1
not	1
helped	1
the	1
enemy;	1
I	1
said	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
left	1
drawer.'	1
The	1
meaner	1
part	1
of	1
him	1
would	1
already	1
be	1
saying:	1
`But	1
they	1
may	1
have	1
the	1
sense	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
means	1
the	1
right.'	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
is	1
psychologically	1
possible--in	1
an	1
enlightened	1
age,	1
you	1
know."	1
"It	1
may	1
be	1
psychologically	1
possible,"	1
answered	1
Flambeau,	1
"and	1
it	1
certainly	1
would	1
explain	1
Dreyfus	1
being	1
certain	1
he	1
was	1
wronged	1
and	1
his	1
judges	1
being	1
sure	1
he	1
was	1
guilty.	1
But	1
it	1
won't	1
wash	1
historically,	1
because	1
Dreyfus's	1
document	1
(if	1
it	1
was	1
his	1
document)	1
was	1
literally	1
correct."	1
"I	1
wasn't	1
thinking	1
of	1
Dreyfus,"	1
said	1
Father	1
Brown.	1
Silence	1
had	1
sunk	1
around	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
emptying	1
of	1
the	1
tables;	1
it	1
was	1
already	1
late,	1
though	1
the	1
sunlight	1
still	1
clung	1
to	1
everything,	1
as	1
if	1
accidentally	1
entangled	1
in	1
the	1
trees.	1
In	1
the	1
stillness	1
Flambeau	1
shifted	1
his	1
seat	1
sharply--making	1
an	1
isolated	1
and	1
echoing	1
noise--	1
and	1
threw	1
his	1
elbow	1
over	1
the	1
angle	1
of	1
it.	1
"Well,"	1
he	1
said,	1
rather	1
harshly,	1
"if	1
Hirsch	1
is	1
not	1
better	1
than	1
a	1
timid	1
treason-monger..."	1
"You	1
mustn't	1
be	1
too	1
hard	1
on	1
them,"	1
said	1
Father	1
Brown	1
gently.	1
"It's	1
not	1
entirely	1
their	1
fault;	1
but	1
they	1
have	1
no	1
instincts.	1
I	1
mean	1
those	1
things	1
that	1
make	1
a	1
woman	1
refuse	1
to	1
dance	1
with	1
a	1
man	1
or	1
a	1
man	1
to	1
touch	1
an	1
investment.	1
They've	1
been	1
taught	1
that	1
it's	1
all	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
degree."	1
"Anyhow,"	1
cried	1
Flambeau	1
impatiently,	1
"he's	1
not	1
a	1
patch	1
on	1
my	1
principal;	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
go	1
through	1
with	1
it.	1
Old	1
Dubosc	1
may	1
be	1
a	1
bit	1
mad,	1
but	1
he's	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
patriot	1
after	1
all."	1
Father	1
Brown	1
continued	1
to	1
consume	1
whitebait.	1
Something	1
in	1
the	1
stolid	1
way	1
he	1
did	1
so	1
caused	1
Flambeau's	1
fierce	1
black	1
eyes	1
to	1
ramble	1
over	1
his	1
companion	1
afresh.	1
"What's	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
you?"	1
Flambeau	1
demanded.	1
"Dubosc's	1
all	1
right	1
in	1
that	1
way.	1
You	1
don't	1
doubt	1
him?"	1
"My	1
friend,"	1
said	1
the	1
small	1
priest,	1
laying	1
down	1
his	1
knife	1
and	1
fork	1
in	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
cold	1
despair,	1
"I	1
doubt	1
everything.	1
Everything,	1
I	1
mean,	1
that	1
has	1
happened	1
today.	1
I	1
doubt	1
the	1
whole	1
story,	1
though	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
acted	1
before	1
my	1
face.	1
I	1
doubt	1
every	1
sight	1
that	1
my	1
eyes	1
have	1
seen	1
since	1
morning.	1
There	1
is	1
something	1
in	1
this	1
business	1
quite	1
different	1
from	1
the	1
ordinary	1
police	1
mystery	1
where	1
one	1
man	1
is	1
more	1
or	1
less	1
lying	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
man	1
more	1
or	1
less	1
telling	1
the	1
truth.	1
Here	1
both	1
men....	1
Well!	1
I've	1
told	1
you	1
the	1
only	1
theory	1
I	1
can	1
think	1
of	1
that	1
could	1
satisfy	1
anybody.	1
It	1
doesn't	1
satisfy	1
me."	1
"Nor	1
me	1
either,"	1
replied	1
Flambeau	1
frowning,	1
while	1
the	1
other	1
went	1
on	1
eating	1
fish	1
with	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
entire	1
resignation.	1
"If	1
all	1
you	1
can	1
suggest	1
is	1
that	1
notion	1
of	1
a	1
message	1
conveyed	1
by	1
contraries,	1
I	1
call	1
it	1
uncommonly	1
clever,	1
but...well,	1
what	1
would	1
you	1
call	1
it?"	1
"I	1
should	1
call	1
it	1
thin,"	1
said	1
the	1
priest	1
promptly.	1
"I	1
should	1
call	1
it	1
uncommonly	1
thin.	1
But	1
that's	1
the	1
queer	1
thing	1
about	1
the	1
whole	1
business.	1
The	1
lie	1
is	1
like	1
a	1
schoolboy's.	1
There	1
are	1
only	1
three	1
versions,	1
Dubosc's	1
and	1
Hirsch's	1
and	1
that	1
fancy	1
of	1
mine.	1
Either	1
that	1
note	1
was	1
written	1
by	1
a	1
French	1
officer	1
to	1
ruin	1
a	1
French	1
official;	1
or	1
it	1
was	1
written	1
by	1
the	1
French	1
official	1
to	1
help	1
German	1
officers;	1
or	1
it	1
was	1
written	1
by	1
the	1
French	1
official	1
to	1
mislead	1
German	1
officers.	1
Very	1
well.	1
You'd	1
expect	1
a	1
secret	1
paper	1
passing	1
between	1
such	1
people,	1
officials	1
or	1
officers,	1
to	1
look	1
quite	1
different	1
from	1
that.	1
You'd	1
expect,	1
probably	1
a	1
cipher,	1
certainly	1
abbreviations;	1
most	1
certainly	1
scientific	1
and	1
strictly	1
professional	1
terms.	1
But	1
this	1
thing's	1
elaborately	1
simple,	1
like	1
a	1
penny	1
dreadful:	1
`In	1
the	1
purple	1
grotto	1
you	1
will	1
find	1
the	1
golden	1
casket.'	1
It	1
looks	1
as	1
if...	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
meant	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
through	1
at	1
once."	1
Almost	1
before	1
they	1
could	1
take	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
short	1
figure	1
in	1
French	1
uniform	1
had	1
walked	1
up	1
to	1
their	1
table	1
like	1
the	1
wind,	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
with	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
thump.	1
"I	1
have	1
extraordinary	1
news,"	1
said	1
the	1
Duc	1
de	1
Valognes.	1
"I	1
have	1
just	1
come	1
from	1
this	1
Colonel	1
of	1
ours.	1
He	1
is	1
packing	1
up	1
to	1
leave	1
the	1
country,	1
and	1
he	1
asks	1
us	1
to	1
make	1
his	1
excuses	1
sur	1
le	1
terrain."	1
"What?"	1
cried	1
Flambeau,	1
with	1
an	1
incredulity	1
quite	1
frightful--	1
"apologize?"	1
"Yes,"	1
said	1
the	1
Duke	1
gruffly;	1
"then	1
and	1
there--before	1
everybody--	1
when	1
the	1
swords	1
are	1
drawn.	1
And	1
you	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
do	1
it	1
while	1
he	1
is	1
leaving	1
the	1
country."	1
"But	1
what	1
can	1
this	1
mean?"	1
cried	1
Flambeau.	1
"He	1
can't	1
be	1
afraid	1
of	1
that	1
little	1
Hirsch!	1
Confound	1
it!"	1
he	1
cried,	1
in	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
rational	1
rage;	1
"nobody	1
could	1
be	1
afraid	1
of	1
Hirsch!"	1
"I	1
believe	1
it's	1
some	1
plot!"	1
snapped	1
Valognes--"some	1
plot	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
and	1
Freemasons.	1
It's	1
meant	1
to	1
work	1
up	1
glory	1
for	1
Hirsch..."	1
The	1
face	1
of	1
Father	1
Brown	1
was	1
commonplace,	1
but	1
curiously	1
contented;	1
it	1
could	1
shine	1
with	1
ignorance	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
with	1
knowledge.	1
But	1
there	1
was	1
always	1
one	1
flash	1
when	1
the	1
foolish	1
mask	1
fell,	1
and	1
the	1
wise	1
mask	1
fitted	1
itself	1
in	1
its	1
place;	1
and	1
Flambeau,	1
who	1
knew	1
his	1
friend,	1
knew	1
that	1
his	1
friend	1
had	1
suddenly	1
understood.	1
Brown	1
said	1
nothing,	1
but	1
finished	1
his	1
plate	1
of	1
fish.	1
"Where	1
did	1
you	1
last	1
see	1
our	1
precious	1
Colonel?"	1
asked	1
Flambeau,	1
irritably.	1
"He's	1
round	1
at	1
the	1
Hotel	1
Saint	1
Louis	1
by	1
the	1
Elysee,	1
where	1
we	1
drove	1
with	1
him.	1
He's	1
packing	1
up,	1
I	1
tell	1
you."	1
"Will	1
he	1
be	1
there	1
still,	1
do	1
you	1
think?"	1
asked	1
Flambeau,	1
frowning	1
at	1
the	1
table.	1
"I	1
don't	1
think	1
he	1
can	1
get	1
away	1
yet,"	1
replied	1
the	1
Duke;	1
"he's	1
packing	1
to	1
go	1
a	1
long	1
journey..."	1
"No,"	1
said	1
Father	1
Brown,	1
quite	1
simply,	1
but	1
suddenly	1
standing	1
up,	1
"for	1
a	1
very	1
short	1
journey.	1
For	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
shortest,	1
in	1
fact.	1
But	1
we	1
may	1
still	1
be	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
catch	1
him	1
if	1
we	1
go	1
there	1
in	1
a	1
motor-cab."	1
Nothing	1
more	1
could	1
be	1
got	1
out	1
of	1
him	1
until	1
the	1
cab	1
swept	1
round	1
the	1
corner	1
by	1
the	1
Hotel	1
Saint	1
Louis,	1
where	1
they	1
got	1
out,	1
and	1
he	1
led	1
the	1
party	1
up	1
a	1
side	1
lane	1
already	1
in	1
deep	1
shadow	1
with	1
the	1
growing	1
dusk.	1
Once,	1
when	1
the	1
Duke	1
impatiently	1
asked	1
whether	1
Hirsch	1
was	1
guilty	1
of	1
treason	1
or	1
not,	1
he	1
answered	1
rather	1
absently:	1
"No;	1
only	1
of	1
ambition--like	1
Caesar."	1
Then	1
he	1
somewhat	1
inconsequently	1
added:	1
"He	1
lives	1
a	1
very	1
lonely	1
life;	1
he	1
has	1
had	1
to	1
do	1
everything	1
for	1
himself."	1
"Well,	1
if	1
he's	1
ambitious,	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
satisfied	1
now,"	1
said	1
Flambeau	1
rather	1
bitterly.	1
"All	1
Paris	1
will	1
cheer	1
him	1
now	1
our	1
cursed	1
Colonel	1
has	1
turned	1
tail."	1
"Don't	1
talk	1
so	1
loud,"	1
said	1
Father	1
Brown,	1
lowering	1
his	1
voice,	1
"your	1
cursed	1
Colonel	1
is	1
just	1
in	1
front."	1
The	1
other	1
two	1
started	1
and	1
shrank	1
farther	1
back	1
into	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
the	1
wall,	1
for	1
the	1
sturdy	1
figure	1
of	1
their	1
runaway	1
principal	1
could	1
indeed	1
be	1
seen	1
shuffling	1
along	1
in	1
the	1
twilight	1
in	1
front,	1
a	1
bag	1
in	1
each	1
hand.	1
He	1
looked	1
much	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
when	1
they	1
first	1
saw	1
him,	1
except	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
changed	1
his	1
picturesque	1
mountaineering	1
knickers	1
for	1
a	1
conventional	1
pair	1
of	1
trousers.	1
It	1
was	1
clear	1
he	1
was	1
already	1
escaping	1
from	1
the	1
hotel.	1
The	1
lane	1
down	1
which	1
they	1
followed	1
him	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
things,	1
and	1
look	1
like	1
the	1
wrong	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
stage	1
scenery.	1
A	1
colourless,	1
continuous	1
wall	1
ran	1
down	1
one	1
flank	1
of	1
it,	1
interrupted	1
at	1
intervals	1
by	1
dull-hued	1
and	1
dirt-stained	1
doors,	1
all	1
shut	1
fast	1
and	1
featureless	1
save	1
for	1
the	1
chalk	1
scribbles	1
of	1
some	1
passing	1
gamin.	1
The	1
tops	1
of	1
trees,	1
mostly	1
rather	1
depressing	1
evergreens,	1
showed	1
at	1
intervals	1
over	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
wall,	1
and	1
beyond	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
grey	1
and	1
purple	1
gloaming	1
could	1
be	1
seen	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
some	1
long	1
terrace	1
of	1
tall	1
Parisian	1
houses,	1
really	1
comparatively	1
close,	1
but	1
somehow	1
looking	1
as	1
inaccessible	1
as	1
a	1
range	1
of	1
marble	1
mountains.	1
On	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
lane	1
ran	1
the	1
high	1
gilt	1
railings	1
of	1
a	1
gloomy	1
park.	1
Flambeau	1
was	1
looking	1
round	1
him	1
in	1
rather	1
a	1
weird	1
way.	1
"Do	1
you	1
know,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"there	1
is	1
something	1
about	1
this	1
place	1
that--"	1
"Hullo!"	1
called	1
out	1
the	1
Duke	1
sharply;	1
"that	1
fellow's	1
disappeared.	1
Vanished,	1
like	1
a	1
blasted	1
fairy!"	1
"He	1
has	1
a	1
key,"	1
explained	1
their	1
clerical	1
friend.	1
"He's	1
only	1
gone	1
into	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
garden	1
doors,"	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
spoke	1
they	1
heard	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
dull	1
wooden	1
doors	1
close	1
again	1
with	1
a	1
click	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
them.	1
Flambeau	1
strode	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
thus	1
shut	1
almost	1
in	1
his	1
face,	1
and	1
stood	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
it	1
for	1
a	1
moment,	1
biting	1
his	1
black	1
moustache	1
in	1
a	1
fury	1
of	1
curiosity.	1
Then	1
he	1
threw	1
up	1
his	1
long	1
arms	1
and	1
swung	1
himself	1
aloft	1
like	1
a	1
monkey	1
and	1
stood	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
wall,	1
his	1
enormous	1
figure	1
dark	1
against	1
the	1
purple	1
sky,	1
like	1
the	1
dark	1
tree-tops.	1
The	1
Duke	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
priest.	1
"Dubosc's	1
escape	1
is	1
more	1
elaborate	1
than	1
we	1
thought,"	1
he	1
said;	1
"but	1
I	1
suppose	1
he	1
is	1
escaping	1
from	1
France."	1
"He	1
is	1
escaping	1
from	1
everywhere,"	1
answered	1
Father	1
Brown.	1
Valognes's	1
eyes	1
brightened,	1
but	1
his	1
voice	1
sank.	1
"Do	1
you	1
mean	1
suicide?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
"You	1
will	1
not	1
find	1
his	1
body,"	1
replied	1
the	1
other.	1
A	1
kind	1
of	1
cry	1
came	1
from	1
Flambeau	1
on	1
the	1
wall	1
above.	1
"My	1
God,"	1
he	1
exclaimed	1
in	1
French,	1
"I	1
know	1
what	1
this	1
place	1
is	1
now!	1
Why,	1
it's	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
the	1
street	1
where	1
old	1
Hirsch	1
lives.	1
I	1
thought	1
I	1
could	1
recognize	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
a	1
house	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
a	1
man."	1
"And	1
Dubosc's	1
gone	1
in	1
there!"	1
cried	1
the	1
Duke,	1
smiting	1
his	1
hip.	1
"Why,	1
they'll	1
meet	1
after	1
all!"	1
And	1
with	1
sudden	1
Gallic	1
vivacity	1
he	1
hopped	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
wall	1
beside	1
Flambeau	1
and	1
sat	1
there	1
positively	1
kicking	1
his	1
legs	1
with	1
excitement.	1
The	1
priest	1
alone	1
remained	1
below,	1
leaning	1
against	1
the	1
wall,	1
with	1
his	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
whole	1
theatre	1
of	1
events,	1
and	1
looking	1
wistfully	1
across	1
to	1
the	1
park	1
palings	1
and	1
the	1
twinkling,	1
twilit	1
trees.	1
The	1
Duke,	1
however	1
stimulated,	1
had	1
the	1
instincts	1
of	1
an	1
aristocrat,	1
and	1
desired	1
rather	1
to	1
stare	1
at	1
the	1
house	1
than	1
to	1
spy	1
on	1
it;	1
but	1
Flambeau,	1
who	1
had	1
the	1
instincts	1
of	1
a	1
burglar	1
(and	1
a	1
detective),	1
had	1
already	1
swung	1
himself	1
from	1
the	1
wall	1
into	1
the	1
fork	1
of	1
a	1
straggling	1
tree	1
from	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
crawl	1
quite	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
only	1
illuminated	1
window	1
in	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
the	1
high	1
dark	1
house.	1
A	1
red	1
blind	1
had	1
been	1
pulled	1
down	1
over	1
the	1
light,	1
but	1
pulled	1
crookedly,	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
gaped	1
on	1
one	1
side,	1
and	1
by	1
risking	1
his	1
neck	1
along	1
a	1
branch	1
that	1
looked	1
as	1
treacherous	1
as	1
a	1
twig,	1
Flambeau	1
could	1
just	1
see	1
Colonel	1
Dubosc	1
walking	1
about	1
in	1
a	1
brilliantly-lighted	1
and	1
luxurious	1
bedroom.	1
But	1
close	1
as	1
Flambeau	1
was	1
to	1
the	1
house,	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
his	1
colleagues	1
by	1
the	1
wall,	1
and	1
repeated	1
them	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice.	1
"Yes,	1
they	1
will	1
meet	1
now	1
after	1
all!"	1
"They	1
will	1
never	1
meet,"	1
said	1
Father	1
Brown.	1
"Hirsch	1
was	1
right	1
when	1
he	1
said	1
that	1
in	1
such	1
an	1
affair	1
the	1
principals	1
must	1
not	1
meet.	1
Have	1
you	1
read	1
a	1
queer	1
psychological	1
story	1
by	1
Henry	1
James,	1
of	1
two	1
persons	1
who	1
so	1
perpetually	1
missed	1
meeting	1
each	1
other	1
by	1
accident	1
that	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
feel	1
quite	1
frightened	1
of	1
each	1
other,	1
and	1
to	1
think	1
it	1
was	1
fate?	1
This	1
is	1
something	1
of	1
the	1
kind,	1
but	1
more	1
curious."	1
"There	1
are	1
people	1
in	1
Paris	1
who	1
will	1
cure	1
them	1
of	1
such	1
morbid	1
fancies,"	1
said	1
Valognes	1
vindictively.	1
"They	1
will	1
jolly	1
well	1
have	1
to	1
meet	1
if	1
we	1
capture	1
them	1
and	1
force	1
them	1
to	1
fight."	1
"They	1
will	1
not	1
meet	1
on	1
the	1
Day	1
of	1
Judgement,"	1
said	1
the	1
priest.	1
"If	1
God	1
Almighty	1
held	1
the	1
truncheon	1
of	1
the	1
lists,	1
if	1
St	1
Michael	1
blew	1
the	1
trumpet	1
for	1
the	1
swords	1
to	1
cross--even	1
then,	1
if	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
stood	1
ready,	1
the	1
other	1
would	1
not	1
come."	1
"Oh,	1
what	1
does	1
all	1
this	1
mysticism	1
mean?"	1
cried	1
the	1
Duc	1
de	1
Valognes,	1
impatiently;	1
"why	1
on	1
earth	1
shouldn't	1
they	1
meet	1
like	1
other	1
people?"	1
"They	1
are	1
the	1
opposite	1
of	1
each	1
other,"	1
said	1
Father	1
Brown,	1
with	1
a	1
queer	1
kind	1
of	1
smile.	1
"They	1
contradict	1
each	1
other.	1
They	1
cancel	1
out,	1
so	1
to	1
speak."	1
He	1
continued	1
to	1
gaze	1
at	1
the	1
darkening	1
trees	1
opposite,	1
but	1
Valognes	1
turned	1
his	1
head	1
sharply	1
at	1
a	1
suppressed	1
exclamation	1
from	1
Flambeau.	1
That	1
investigator,	1
peering	1
into	1
the	1
lighted	1
room,	1
had	1
just	1
seen	1
the	1
Colonel,	1
after	1
a	1
pace	1
or	1
two,	1
proceed	1
to	1
take	1
his	1
coat	1
off.	1
Flambeau's	1
first	1
thought	1
was	1
that	1
this	1
really	1
looked	1
like	1
a	1
fight;	1
but	1
he	1
soon	1
dropped	1
the	1
thought	1
for	1
another.	1
The	1
solidity	1
and	1
squareness	1
of	1
Dubosc's	1
chest	1
and	1
shoulders	1
was	1
all	1
a	1
powerful	1
piece	1
of	1
padding	1
and	1
came	1
off	1
with	1
his	1
coat.	1
In	1
his	1
shirt	1
and	1
trousers	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
comparatively	1
slim	1
gentleman,	1
who	1
walked	1
across	1
the	1
bedroom	1
to	1
the	1
bathroom	1
with	1
no	1
more	1
pugnacious	1
purpose	1
than	1
that	1
of	1
washing	1
himself.	1
He	1
bent	1
over	1
a	1
basin,	1
dried	1
his	1
dripping	1
hands	1
and	1
face	1
on	1
a	1
towel,	1
and	1
turned	1
again	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
strong	1
light	1
fell	1
on	1
his	1
face.	1
His	1
brown	1
complexion	1
had	1
gone,	1
his	1
big	1
black	1
moustache	1
had	1
gone;	1
he--was	1
clean-shaven	1
and	1
very	1
pate.	1
Nothing	1
remained	1
of	1
the	1
Colonel	1
but	1
his	1
bright,	1
hawk-like,	1
brown	1
eyes.	1
Under	1
the	1
wall	1
Father	1
Brown	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
in	1
heavy	1
meditation,	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
himself.	1
"It	1
is	1
all	1
just	1
like	1
what	1
I	1
was	1
saying	1
to	1
Flambeau.	1
These	1
opposites	1
won't	1
do.	1
They	1
don't	1
work.	1
They	1
don't	1
fight.	1
If	1
it's	1
white	1
instead	1
of	1
black,	1
and	1
solid	1
instead	1
of	1
liquid,	1
and	1
so	1
on	1
all	1
along	1
the	1
line--then	1
there's	1
something	1
wrong,	1
Monsieur,	1
there's	1
something	1
wrong.	1
One	1
of	1
these	1
men	1
is	1
fair	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
dark,	1
one	1
stout	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
slim,	1
one	1
strong	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
weak.	1
One	1
has	1
a	1
moustache	1
and	1
no	1
beard,	1
so	1
you	1
can't	1
see	1
his	1
mouth;	1
the	1
other	1
has	1
a	1
beard	1
and	1
no	1
moustache,	1
so	1
you	1
can't	1
see	1
his	1
chin.	1
One	1
has	1
hair	1
cropped	1
to	1
his	1
skull,	1
but	1
a	1
scarf	1
to	1
hide	1
his	1
neck;	1
the	1
other	1
has	1
low	1
shirt-collars,	1
but	1
long	1
hair	1
to	1
bide	1
his	1
skull.	1
It's	1
all	1
too	1
neat	1
and	1
correct,	1
Monsieur,	1
and	1
there's	1
something	1
wrong.	1
Things	1
made	1
so	1
opposite	1
are	1
things	1
that	1
cannot	1
quarrel.	1
Wherever	1
the	1
one	1
sticks	1
out	1
the	1
other	1
sinks	1
in.	1
Like	1
a	1
face	1
and	1
a	1
mask,	1
like	1
a	1
lock	1
and	1
a	1
key..."	1
Flambeau	1
was	1
peering	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
with	1
a	1
visage	1
as	1
white	1
as	1
a	1
sheet.	1
The	1
occupant	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
was	1
standing	1
with	1
his	1
back	1
to	1
him,	1
but	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
a	1
looking-glass,	1
and	1
had	1
already	1
fitted	1
round	1
his	1
face	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
framework	1
of	1
rank	1
red	1
hair,	1
hanging	1
disordered	1
from	1
the	1
head	1
and	1
clinging	1
round	1
the	1
jaws	1
and	1
chin	1
while	1
leaving	1
the	1
mocking	1
mouth	1
uncovered.	1
Seen	1
thus	1
in	1
the	1
glass	1
the	1
white	1
face	1
looked	1
like	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
Judas	1
laughing	1
horribly	1
and	1
surrounded	1
by	1
capering	1
flames	1
of	1
hell.	1
For	1
a	1
spasm	1
Flambeau	1
saw	1
the	1
fierce,	1
red-brown	1
eyes	1
dancing,	1
then	1
they	1
were	1
covered	1
with	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
blue	1
spectacles.	1
Slipping	1
on	1
a	1
loose	1
black	1
coat,	1
the	1
figure	1
vanished	1
towards	1
the	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
house.	1
A	1
few	1
moments	1
later	1
a	1
roar	1
of	1
popular	1
applause	1
from	1
the	1
street	1
beyond	1
announced	1
that	1
Dr	1
Hirsch	1
had	1
once	1
more	1
appeared	1
upon	1
the	1
balcony.	1
IV.	1
The	1
Man	1
in	1
the	1
Passage	1
TWO	1
men	1
appeared	1
simultaneously	1
at	1
the	1
two	1
ends	1
of	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
passage	1
running	1
along	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
Apollo	1
Theatre	1
in	1
the	1
Adelphi.	1
The	1
evening	1
daylight	1
in	1
the	1
streets	1
was	1
large	1
and	1
luminous,	1
opalescent	1
and	1
empty.	1
The	1
passage	1
was	1
comparatively	1
long	1
and	1
dark,	1
so	1
each	1
man	1
could	1
see	1
the	1
other	1
as	1
a	1
mere	1
black	1
silhouette	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
end.	1
Nevertheless,	1
each	1
man	1
knew	1
the	1
other,	1
even	1
in	1
that	1
inky	1
outline;	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
both	1
men	1
of	1
striking	1
appearance	1
and	1
they	1
hated	1
each	1
other.	1
The	1
covered	1
passage	1
opened	1
at	1
one	1
end	1
on	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
steep	1
streets	1
of	1
the	1
Adelphi,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
on	1
a	1
terrace	1
overlooking	1
the	1
sunset-coloured	1
river.	1
One	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
passage	1
was	1
a	1
blank	1
wall,	1
for	1
the	1
building	1
it	1
supported	1
was	1
an	1
old	1
unsuccessful	1
theatre	1
restaurant,	1
now	1
shut	1
up.	1
The	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
passage	1
contained	1
two	1
doors,	1
one	1
at	1
each	1
end.	1
Neither	1
was	1
what	1
was	1
commonly	1
called	1
the	1
stage	1
door;	1
they	1
were	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
special	1
and	1
private	1
stage	1
doors	1
used	1
by	1
very	1
special	1
performers,	1
and	1
in	1
this	1
case	1
by	1
the	1
star	1
actor	1
and	1
actress	1
in	1
the	1
Shakespearean	1
performance	1
of	1
the	1
day.	1
Persons	1
of	1
that	1
eminence	1
often	1
like	1
to	1
have	1
such	1
private	1
exits	1
and	1
entrances,	1
for	1
meeting	1
friends	1
or	1
avoiding	1
them.	1
The	1
two	1
men	1
in	1
question	1
were	1
certainly	1
two	1
such	1
friends,	1
men	1
who	1
evidently	1
knew	1
the	1
doors	1
and	1
counted	1
on	1
their	1
opening,	1
for	1
each	1
approached	1
the	1
door	1
at	1
the	1
upper	1
end	1
with	1
equal	1
coolness	1
and	1
confidence.	1
Not,	1
however,	1
with	1
equal	1
speed;	1
but	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
walked	1
fast	1
was	1
the	1
man	1
from	1
the	1
other	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
tunnel,	1
so	1
they	1
both	1
arrived	1
before	1
the	1
secret	1
stage	1
door	1
almost	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
instant.	1
They	1
saluted	1
each	1
other	1
with	1
civility,	1
and	1
waited	1
a	1
moment	1
before	1
one	1
of	1
them,	1
the	1
sharper	1
walker	1
who	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
shorter	1
patience,	1
knocked	1
at	1
the	1
door.	1
In	1
this	1
and	1
everything	1
else	1
each	1
man	1
was	1
opposite	1
and	1
neither	1
could	1
be	1
called	1
inferior.	1
As	1
private	1
persons	1
both	1
were	1
handsome,	1
capable	1
and	1
popular.	1
As	1
public	1
persons,	1
both	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
public	1
rank.	1
But	1
everything	1
about	1
them,	1
from	1
their	1
glory	1
to	1
their	1
good	1
looks,	1
was	1
of	1
a	1
diverse	1
and	1
incomparable	1
kind.	1
Sir	1
Wilson	1
Seymour	1
was	1
the	1
kind	1
of	1
man	1
whose	1
importance	1
is	1
known	1
to	1
everybody	1
who	1
knows.	1
The	1
more	1
you	1
mixed	1
with	1
the	1
innermost	1
ring	1
in	1
every	1
polity	1
or	1
profession,	1
the	1
more	1
often	1
you	1
met	1
Sir	1
Wilson	1
Seymour.	1
He	1
was	1
the	1
one	1
intelligent	1
man	1
on	1
twenty	1
unintelligent	1
committees--on	1
every	1
sort	1
of	1
subject,	1
from	1
the	1
reform	1
of	1
the	1
Royal	1
Academy	1
to	1
the	1
project	1
of	1
bimetallism	1
for	1
Greater	1
Britain.	1
In	1
the	1
Arts	1
especially	1
he	1
was	1
omnipotent.	1
He	1
was	1
so	1
unique	1
that	1
nobody	1
could	1
quite	1
decide	1
whether	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
aristocrat	1
who	1
had	1
taken	1
up	1
Art,	1
or	1
a	1
great	1
artist	1
whom	1
the	1
aristocrats	1
had	1
taken	1
up.	1
But	1
you	1
could	1
not	1
meet	1
him	1
for	1
five	1
minutes	1
without	1
realizing	1
that	1
you	1
had	1
really	1
been	1
ruled	1
by	1
him	1
all	1
your	1
life.	1
His	1
appearance	1
was	1
"distinguished"	1
in	1
exactly	1
the	1
same	1
sense;	1
it	1
was	1
at	1
once	1
conventional	1
and	1
unique.	1
Fashion	1
could	1
have	1
found	1
no	1
fault	1
with	1
his	1
high	1
silk	1
hat--,	1
yet	1
it	1
was	1
unlike	1
anyone	1
else's	1
hat--	1
a	1
little	1
higher,	1
perhaps,	1
and	1
adding	1
something	1
to	1
his	1
natural	1
height.	1
His	1
tall,	1
slender	1
figure	1
had	1
a	1
slight	1
stoop	1
yet	1
it	1
looked	1
the	1
reverse	1
of	1
feeble.	1
His	1
hair	1
was	1
silver-grey,	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
look	1
old;	1
it	1
was	1
worn	1
longer	1
than	1
the	1
common	1
yet	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
look	1
effeminate;	1
it	1
was	1
curly	1
but	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
look	1
curled.	1
His	1
carefully	1
pointed	1
beard	1
made	1
him	1
look	1
more	1
manly	1
and	1
militant	1
than	1
otherwise,	1
as	1
it	1
does	1
in	1
those	1
old	1
admirals	1
of	1
Velazquez	1
with	1
whose	1
dark	1
portraits	1
his	1
house	1
was	1
hung.	1
His	1
grey	1
gloves	1
were	1
a	1
shade	1
bluer,	1
his	1
silver-knobbed	1
cane	1
a	1
shade	1
longer	1
than	1
scores	1
of	1
such	1
gloves	1
and	1
canes	1
flapped	1
and	1
flourished	1
about	1
the	1
theatres	1
and	1
the	1
restaurants.	1
The	1
other	1
man	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
tall,	1
yet	1
would	1
have	1
struck	1
nobody	1
as	1
short,	1
but	1
merely	1
as	1
strong	1
and	1
handsome.	1
His	1
hair	1
also	1
was	1
curly,	1
but	1
fair	1
and	1
cropped	1
close	1
to	1
a	1
strong,	1
massive	1
head--the	1
sort	1
of	1
head	1
you	1
break	1
a	1
door	1
with,	1
as	1
Chaucer	1
said	1
of	1
the	1
Miller's.	1
His	1
military	1
moustache	1
and	1
the	1
carriage	1
of	1
his	1
shoulders	1
showed	1
him	1
a	1
soldier,	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
those	1
peculiar	1
frank	1
and	1
piercing	1
blue	1
eyes	1
which	1
are	1
more	1
common	1
in	1
sailors.	1
His	1
face	1
was	1
somewhat	1
square,	1
his	1
jaw	1
was	1
square,	1
his	1
shoulders	1
were	1
square,	1
even	1
his	1
jacket	1
was	1
square.	1
Indeed,	1
in	1
the	1
wild	1
school	1
of	1
caricature	1
then	1
current,	1
Mr	1
Max	1
Beerbohm	1
had	1
represented	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
proposition	1
in	1
the	1
fourth	1
book	1
of	1
Euclid.	1
For	1
he	1
also	1
was	1
a	1
public	1
man,	1
though	1
with	1
quite	1
another	1
sort	1
of	1
success.	1
You	1
did	1
not	1
have	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
best	1
society	1
to	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
Captain	1
Cutler,	1
of	1
the	1
siege	1
of	1
Hong-Kong,	1
and	1
the	1
great	1
march	1
across	1
China.	1
You	1
could	1
not	1
get	1
away	1
from	1
hearing	1
of	1
him	1
wherever	1
you	1
were;	1
his	1
portrait	1
was	1
on	1
every	1
other	1
postcard;	1
his	1
maps	1
and	1
battles	1
in	1
every	1
other	1
illustrated	1
paper;	1
songs	1
in	1
his	1
honour	1
in	1
every	1
other	1
music-hall	1
turn	1
or	1
on	1
every	1
other	1
barrel-organ.	1
His	1
fame,	1
though	1
probably	1
more	1
temporary,	1
was	1
ten	1
times	1
more	1
wide,	1
popular	1
and	1
spontaneous	1
than	1
the	1
other	1
man's.	1
In	1
thousands	1
of	1
English	1
homes	1
he	1
appeared	1
enormous	1
above	1
England,	1
like	1
Nelson.	1
Yet	1
he	1
had	1
infinitely	1
less	1
power	1
in	1
England	1
than	1
Sir	1
Wilson	1
Seymour.	1
The	1
door	1
was	1
opened	1
to	1
them	1
by	1
an	1
aged	1
servant	1
or	1
"dresser",	1
whose	1
broken-down	1
face	1
and	1
figure	1
and	1
black	1
shabby	1
coat	1
and	1
trousers	1
contrasted	1
queerly	1
with	1
the	1
glittering	1
interior	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
actress's	1
dressing-room.	1
It	1
was	1
fitted	1
and	1
filled	1
with	1
looking-glasses	1
at	1
every	1
angle	1
of	1
refraction,	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
looked	1
like	1
the	1
hundred	1
facets	1
of	1
one	1
huge	1
diamond--if	1
one	1
could	1
get	1
inside	1
a	1
diamond.	1
The	1
other	1
features	1
of	1
luxury,	1
a	1
few	1
flowers,	1
a	1
few	1
coloured	1
cushions,	1
a	1
few	1
scraps	1
of	1
stage	1
costume,	1
were	1
multiplied	1
by	1
all	1
the	1
mirrors	1
into	1
the	1
madness	1
of	1
the	1
Arabian	1
Nights,	1
and	1
danced	1
and	1
changed	1
places	1
perpetually	1
as	1
the	1
shuffling	1
attendant	1
shifted	1
a	1
mirror	1
outwards	1
or	1
shot	1
one	1
back	1
against	1
the	1
wall.	1
They	1
both	1
spoke	1
to	1
the	1
dingy	1
dresser	1
by	1
name,	1
calling	1
him	1
Parkinson,	1
and	1
asking	1
for	1
the	1
lady	1
as	1
Miss	1
Aurora	1
Rome.	1
Parkinson	1
said	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
other	1
room,	1
but	1
he	1
would	1
go	1
and	1
tell	1
her.	1
A	1
shade	1
crossed	1
the	1
brow	1
of	1
both	1
visitors;	1
for	1
the	1
other	1
room	1
was	1
the	1
private	1
room	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
actor	1
with	1
whom	1
Miss	1
Aurora	1
was	1
performing,	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
of	1
the	1
kind	1
that	1
does	1
not	1
inflame	1
admiration	1
without	1
inflaming	1
jealousy.	1
In	1
about	1
half	1
a	1
minute,	1
however,	1
the	1
inner	1
door	1
opened,	1
and	1
she	1
entered	1
as	1
she	1
always	1
did,	1
even	1
in	1
private	1
life,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
very	1
silence	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
roar	1
of	1
applause,	1
and	1
one	1
well-deserved.	1
She	1
was	1
clad	1
in	1
a	1
somewhat	1
strange	1
garb	1
of	1
peacock	1
green	1
and	1
peacock	1
blue	1
satins,	1
that	1
gleamed	1
like	1
blue	1
and	1
green	1
metals,	1
such	1
as	1
delight	1
children	1
and	1
aesthetes,	1
and	1
her	1
heavy,	1
hot	1
brown	1
hair	1
framed	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
magic	1
faces	1
which	1
are	1
dangerous	1
to	1
all	1
men,	1
but	1
especially	1
to	1
boys	1
and	1
to	1
men	1
growing	1
grey.	1
In	1
company	1
with	1
her	1
male	1
colleague,	1
the	1
great	1
American	1
actor,	1
Isidore	1
Bruno,	1
she	1
was	1
producing	1
a	1
particularly	1
poetical	1
and	1
fantastic	1
interpretation	1
of	1
Midsummer	1
Night's	1
Dream:	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
artistic	1
prominence	1
was	1
given	1
to	1
Oberon	1
and	1
Titania,	1
or	1
in	1
other	1
words	1
to	1
Bruno	1
and	1
herself.	1
Set	1
in	1
dreamy	1
and	1
exquisite	1
scenery,	1
and	1
moving	1
in	1
mystical	1
dances,	1
the	1
green	1
costume,	1
like	1
burnished	1
beetle-wings,	1
expressed	1
all	1
the	1
elusive	1
individuality	1
of	1
an	1
elfin	1
queen.	1
But	1
when	1
personally	1
confronted	1
in	1
what	1
was	1
still	1
broad	1
daylight,	1
a	1
man	1
looked	1
only	1
at	1
the	1
woman's	1
face.	1
She	1
greeted	1
both	1
men	1
with	1
the	1
beaming	1
and	1
baffling	1
smile	1
which	1
kept	1
so	1
many	1
males	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
just	1
dangerous	1
distance	1
from	1
her.	1
She	1
accepted	1
some	1
flowers	1
from	1
Cutler,	1
which	1
were	1
as	1
tropical	1
and	1
expensive	1
as	1
his	1
victories;	1
and	1
another	1
sort	1
of	1
present	1
from	1
Sir	1
Wilson	1
Seymour,	1
offered	1
later	1
on	1
and	1
more	1
nonchalantly	1
by	1
that	1
gentleman.	1
For	1
it	1
was	1
against	1
his	1
breeding	1
to	1
show	1
eagerness,	1
and	1
against	1
his	1
conventional	1
unconventionality	1
to	1
give	1
anything	1
so	1
obvious	1
as	1
flowers.	1
He	1
had	1
picked	1
up	1
a	1
trifle,	1
he	1
said,	1
which	1
was	1
rather	1
a	1
curiosity,	1
it	1
was	1
an	1
ancient	1
Greek	1
dagger	1
of	1
the	1
Mycenaean	1
Epoch,	1
and	1
might	1
well	1
have	1
been	1
worn	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
Theseus	1
and	1
Hippolyta.	1
It	1
was	1
made	1
of	1
brass	1
like	1
all	1
the	1
Heroic	1
weapons,	1
but,	1
oddly	1
enough,	1
sharp	1
enough	1
to	1
prick	1
anyone	1
still.	1
He	1
had	1
really	1
been	1
attracted	1
to	1
it	1
by	1
the	1
leaf-like	1
shape;	1
it	1
was	1
as	1
perfect	1
as	1
a	1
Greek	1
vase.	1
If	1
it	1
was	1
of	1
any	1
interest	1
to	1
Miss	1
Rome	1
or	1
could	1
come	1
in	1
anywhere	1
in	1
the	1
play,	1
he	1
hoped	1
she	1
would--	1
The	1
inner	1
door	1
burst	1
open	1
and	1
a	1
big	1
figure	1
appeared,	1
who	1
was	1
more	1
of	1
a	1
contrast	1
to	1
the	1
explanatory	1
Seymour	1
than	1
even	1
Captain	1
Cutler.	1
Nearly	1
six-foot-six,	1
and	1
of	1
more	1
than	1
theatrical	1
thews	1
and	1
muscles,	1
Isidore	1
Bruno,	1
in	1
the	1
gorgeous	1
leopard	1
skin	1
and	1
golden-brown	1
garments	1
of	1
Oberon,	1
looked	1
like	1
a	1
barbaric	1
god.	1
He	1
leaned	1
on	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
hunting-spear,	1
which	1
across	1
a	1
theatre	1
looked	1
a	1
slight,	1
silvery	1
wand,	1
but	1
which	1
in	1
the	1
small	1
and	1
comparatively	1
crowded	1
room	1
looked	1
as	1
plain	1
as	1
a	1
pike-staff--and	1
as	1
menacing.	1
His	1
vivid	1
black	1
eyes	1
rolled	1
volcanically,	1
his	1
bronzed	1
face,	1
handsome	1
as	1
it	1
was,	1
showed	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
a	1
combination	1
of	1
high	1
cheekbones	1
with	1
set	1
white	1
teeth,	1
which	1
recalled	1
certain	1
American	1
conjectures	1
about	1
his	1
origin	1
in	1
the	1
Southern	1
plantations.	1
"Aurora,"	1
he	1
began,	1
in	1
that	1
deep	1
voice	1
like	1
a	1
drum	1
of	1
passion	1
that	1
had	1
moved	1
so	1
many	1
audiences,	1
"will	1
you--"	1
He	1
stopped	1
indecisively	1
because	1
a	1
sixth	1
figure	1
had	1
suddenly	1
presented	1
itself	1
just	1
inside	1
the	1
doorway--a	1
figure	1
so	1
incongruous	1
in	1
the	1
scene	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
almost	1
comic.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
short	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
black	1
uniform	1
of	1
the	1
Roman	1
secular	1
clergy,	1
and	1
looking	1
(especially	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
presence	1
as	1
Bruno's	1
and	1
Aurora's)	1
rather	1
like	1
the	1
wooden	1
Noah	1
out	1
of	1
an	1
ark.	1
He	1
did	1
not,	1
however,	1
seem	1
conscious	1
of	1
any	1
contrast,	1
but	1
said	1
with	1
dull	1
civility:	1
"I	1
believe	1
Miss	1
Rome	1
sent	1
for	1
me."	1
A	1
shrewd	1
observer	1
might	1
have	1
remarked	1
that	1
the	1
emotional	1
temperature	1
rather	1
rose	1
at	1
so	1
unemotional	1
an	1
interruption.	1
The	1
detachment	1
of	1
a	1
professional	1
celibate	1
seemed	1
to	1
reveal	1
to	1
the	1
others	1
that	1
they	1
stood	1
round	1
the	1
woman	1
as	1
a	1
ring	1
of	1
amorous	1
rivals;	1
just	1
as	1
a	1
stranger	1
coming	1
in	1
with	1
frost	1
on	1
his	1
coat	1
will	1
reveal	1
that	1
a	1
room	1
is	1
like	1
a	1
furnace.	1
The	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
one	1
man	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
care	1
about	1
her	1
increased	1
Miss	1
Rome's	1
sense	1
that	1
everybody	1
else	1
was	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
her,	1
and	1
each	1
in	1
a	1
somewhat	1
dangerous	1
way:	1
the	1
actor	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
appetite	1
of	1
a	1
savage	1
and	1
a	1
spoilt	1
child;	1
the	1
soldier	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
simple	1
selfishness	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
will	1
rather	1
than	1
mind;	1
Sir	1
Wilson	1
with	1
that	1
daily	1
hardening	1
concentration	1
with	1
which	1
old	1
Hedonists	1
take	1
to	1
a	1
hobby;	1
nay,	1
even	1
the	1
abject	1
Parkinson,	1
who	1
had	1
known	1
her	1
before	1
her	1
triumphs,	1
and	1
who	1
followed	1
her	1
about	1
the	1
room	1
with	1
eyes	1
or	1
feet,	1
with	1
the	1
dumb	1
fascination	1
of	1
a	1
dog.	1
A	1
shrewd	1
person	1
might	1
also	1
have	1
noted	1
a	1
yet	1
odder	1
thing.	1
The	1
man	1
like	1
a	1
black	1
wooden	1
Noah	1
(who	1
was	1
not	1
wholly	1
without	1
shrewdness)	1
noted	1
it	1
with	1
a	1
considerable	1
but	1
contained	1
amusement.	1
It	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
the	1
great	1
Aurora,	1
though	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
indifferent	1
to	1
the	1
admiration	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
sex,	1
wanted	1
at	1
this	1
moment	1
to	1
get	1
rid	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
who	1
admired	1
her	1
and	1
be	1
left	1
alone	1
with	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
did	1
not--	1
did	1
not	1
admire	1
her	1
in	1
that	1
sense	1
at	1
least;	1
for	1
the	1
little	1
priest	1
did	1
admire	1
and	1
even	1
enjoy	1
the	1
firm	1
feminine	1
diplomacy	1
with	1
which	1
she	1
set	1
about	1
her	1
task.	1
There	1
was,	1
perhaps,	1
only	1
one	1
thing	1
that	1
Aurora	1
Rome	1
was	1
clever	1
about,	1
and	1
that	1
was	1
one	1
half	1
of	1
humanity--	1
the	1
other	1
half.	1
The	1
little	1
priest	1
watched,	1
like	1
a	1
Napoleonic	1
campaign,	1
the	1
swift	1
precision	1
of	1
her	1
policy	1
for	1
expelling	1
all	1
while	1
banishing	1
none.	1
Bruno,	1
the	1
big	1
actor,	1
was	1
so	1
babyish	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
easy	1
to	1
send	1
him	1
off	1
in	1
brute	1
sulks,	1
banging	1
the	1
door.	1
Cutler,	1
the	1
British	1
officer,	1
was	1
pachydermatous	1
to	1
ideas,	1
but	1
punctilious	1
about	1
behaviour.	1
He	1
would	1
ignore	1
all	1
hints,	1
but	1
he	1
would	1
die	1
rather	1
than	1
ignore	1
a	1
definite	1
commission	1
from	1
a	1
lady.	1
As	1
to	1
old	1
Seymour,	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
treated	1
differently;	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
left	1
to	1
the	1
last.	1
The	1
only	1
way	1
to	1
move	1
him	1
was	1
to	1
appeal	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
confidence	1
as	1
an	1
old	1
friend,	1
to	1
let	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
secret	1
of	1
the	1
clearance.	1
The	1
priest	1
did	1
really	1
admire	1
Miss	1
Rome	1
as	1
she	1
achieved	1
all	1
these	1
three	1
objects	1
in	1
one	1
selected	1
action.	1
She	1
went	1
across	1
to	1
Captain	1
Cutler	1
and	1
said	1
in	1
her	1
sweetest	1
manner:	1
"I	1
shall	1
value	1
all	1
these	1
flowers,	1
because	1
they	1
must	1
be	1
your	1
favourite	1
flowers.	1
But	1
they	1
won't	1
be	1
complete,	1
you	1
know,	1
without	1
my	1
favourite	1
flower.	1
Do	1
go	1
over	1
to	1
that	1
shop	1
round	1
the	1
corner	1
and	1
get	1
me	1
some	1
lilies-of-the-valley,	1
and	1
then	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
quite	1
lovely."	1
The	1
first	1
object	1
of	1
her	1
diplomacy,	1
the	1
exit	1
of	1
the	1
enraged	1
Bruno,	1
was	1
at	1
once	1
achieved.	1
He	1
had	1
already	1
handed	1
his	1
spear	1
in	1
a	1
lordly	1
style,	1
like	1
a	1
sceptre,	1
to	1
the	1
piteous	1
Parkinson,	1
and	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
assume	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
cushioned	1
seats	1
like	1
a	1
throne.	1
But	1
at	1
this	1
open	1
appeal	1
to	1
his	1
rival	1
there	1
glowed	1
in	1
his	1
opal	1
eyeballs	1
all	1
the	1
sensitive	1
insolence	1
of	1
the	1
slave;	1
he	1
knotted	1
his	1
enormous	1
brown	1
fists	1
for	1
an	1
instant,	1
and	1
then,	1
dashing	1
open	1
the	1
door,	1
disappeared	1
into	1
his	1
own	1
apartments	1
beyond.	1
But	1
meanwhile	1
Miss	1
Rome's	1
experiment	1
in	1
mobilizing	1
the	1
British	1
Army	1
had	1
not	1
succeeded	1
so	1
simply	1
as	1
seemed	1
probable.	1
Cutler	1
had	1
indeed	1
risen	1
stiffly	1
and	1
suddenly,	1
and	1
walked	1
towards	1
the	1
door,	1
hatless,	1
as	1
if	1
at	1
a	1
word	1
of	1
command.	1
But	1
perhaps	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
ostentatiously	1
elegant	1
about	1
the	1
languid	1
figure	1
of	1
Seymour	1
leaning	1
against	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
looking-glasses	1
that	1
brought	1
him	1
up	1
short	1
at	1
the	1
entrance,	1
turning	1
his	1
head	1
this	1
way	1
and	1
that	1
like	1
a	1
bewildered	1
bulldog.	1
"I	1
must	1
show	1
this	1
stupid	1
man	1
where	1
to	1
go,"	1
said	1
Aurora	1
in	1
a	1
whisper	1
to	1
Seymour,	1
and	1
ran	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
threshold	1
to	1
speed	1
the	1
parting	1
guest.	1
Seymour	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
listening,	1
elegant	1
and	1
unconscious	1
as	1
was	1
his	1
posture,	1
and	1
he	1
seemed	1
relieved	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
lady	1
call	1
out	1
some	1
last	1
instructions	1
to	1
the	1
Captain,	1
and	1
then	1
turn	1
sharply	1
and	1
run	1
laughing	1
down	1
the	1
passage	1
towards	1
the	1
other	1
end,	1
the	1
end	1
on	1
the	1
terrace	1
above	1
the	1
Thames.	1
Yet	1
a	1
second	1
or	1
two	1
after	1
Seymour's	1
brow	1
darkened	1
again.	1
A	1
man	1
in	1
his	1
position	1
has	1
so	1
many	1
rivals,	1
and	1
he	1
remembered	1
that	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
passage	1
was	1
the	1
corresponding	1
entrance	1
to	1
Bruno's	1
private	1
room.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
lose	1
his	1
dignity;	1
he	1
said	1
some	1
civil	1
words	1
to	1
Father	1
Brown	1
about	1
the	1
revival	1
of	1
Byzantine	1
architecture	1
in	1
the	1
Westminster	1
Cathedral,	1
and	1
then,	1
quite	1
naturally,	1
strolled	1
out	1
himself	1
into	1
the	1
upper	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
passage.	1
Father	1
Brown	1
and	1
Parkinson	1
were	1
left	1
alone,	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
neither	1
of	1
them	1
men	1
with	1
a	1
taste	1
for	1
superfluous	1
conversation.	1
The	1
dresser	1
went	1
round	1
the	1
room,	1
pulling	1
out	1
looking-glasses	1
and	1
pushing	1
them	1
in	1
again,	1
his	1
dingy	1
dark	1
coat	1
and	1
trousers	1
looking	1
all	1
the	1
more	1
dismal	1
since	1
he	1
was	1
still	1
holding	1
the	1
festive	1
fairy	1
spear	1
of	1
King	1
Oberon.	1
Every	1
time	1
he	1
pulled	1
out	1
the	1
frame	1
of	1
a	1
new	1
glass,	1
a	1
new	1
black	1
figure	1
of	1
Father	1
Brown	1
appeared;	1
the	1
absurd	1
glass	1
chamber	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
Father	1
Browns,	1
upside	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
air	1
like	1
angels,	1
turning	1
somersaults	1
like	1
acrobats,	1
turning	1
their	1
backs	1
to	1
everybody	1
like	1
very	1
rude	1
persons.	1
Father	1
Brown	1
seemed	1
quite	1
unconscious	1
of	1
this	1
cloud	1
of	1
witnesses,	1
but	1
followed	1
Parkinson	1
with	1
an	1
idly	1
attentive	1
eye	1
till	1
he	1
took	1
himself	1
and	1
his	1
absurd	1
spear	1
into	1
the	1
farther	1
room	1
of	1
Bruno.	1
Then	1
he	1
abandoned	1
himself	1
to	1
such	1
abstract	1
meditations	1
as	1
always	1
amused	1
him--	1
calculating	1
the	1
angles	1
of	1
the	1
mirrors,	1
the	1
angles	1
of	1
each	1
refraction,	1
the	1
angle	1
at	1
which	1
each	1
must	1
fit	1
into	1
the	1
wall...when	1
he	1
heard	1
a	1
strong	1
but	1
strangled	1
cry.	1
He	1
sprang	1
to	1
his	1
feet	1
and	1
stood	1
rigidly	1
listening.	1
At	1
the	1
same	1
instant	1
Sir	1
Wilson	1
Seymour	1
burst	1
back	1
into	1
the	1
room,	1
white	1
as	1
ivory.	1
"Who's	1
that	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
passage?"	1
he	1
cried.	1
"Where's	1
that	1
dagger	1
of	1
mine?"	1
Before	1
Father	1
Brown	1
could	1
turn	1
in	1
his	1
heavy	1
boots	1
Seymour	1
was	1
plunging	1
about	1
the	1
room	1
looking	1
for	1
the	1
weapon.	1
And	1
before	1
he	1
could	1
possibly	1
find	1
that	1
weapon	1
or	1
any	1
other,	1
a	1
brisk	1
running	1
of	1
feet	1
broke	1
upon	1
the	1
pavement	1
outside,	1
and	1
the	1
square	1
face	1
of	1
Cutler	1
was	1
thrust	1
into	1
the	1
same	1
doorway.	1
He	1
was	1
still	1
grotesquely	1
grasping	1
a	1
bunch	1
of	1
lilies-of-the-valley.	1
"What's	1
this?"	1
he	1
cried.	1
"What's	1
that	1
creature	1
down	1
the	1
passage?	1
Is	1
this	1
some	1
of	1
your	1
tricks?"	1
"My	1
tricks!"	1
hissed	1
his	1
pale	1
rival,	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
stride	1
towards	1
him.	1
In	1
the	1
instant	1
of	1
time	1
in	1
which	1
all	1
this	1
happened	1
Father	1
Brown	1
stepped	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
passage,	1
looked	1
down	1
it,	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
walked	1
briskly	1
towards	1
what	1
he	1
saw.	1
At	1
this	1
the	1
other	1
two	1
men	1
dropped	1
their	1
quarrel	1
and	1
darted	1
after	1
him,	1
Cutler	1
calling	1
out:	1
"What	1
are	1
you	1
doing?	1
Who	1
are	1
you?"	1
"My	1
name	1
is	1
Brown,"	1
said	1
the	1
priest	1
sadly,	1
as	1
he	1
bent	1
over	1
something	1
and	1
straightened	1
himself	1
again.	1
"Miss	1
Rome	1
sent	1
for	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
came	1
as	1
quickly	1
as	1
I	1
could.	1
I	1
have	1
come	1
too	1
late."	1
The	1
three	1
men	1
looked	1
down,	1
and	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
at	1
least	1
the	1
life	1
died	1
in	1
that	1
late	1
light	1
of	1
afternoon.	1
It	1
ran	1
along	1
the	1
passage	1
like	1
a	1
path	1
of	1
gold,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
it	1
Aurora	1
Rome	1
lay	1
lustrous	1
in	1
her	1
robes	1
of	1
green	1
and	1
gold,	1
with	1
her	1
dead	1
face	1
turned	1
upwards.	1
Her	1
dress	1
was	1
torn	1
away	1
as	1
in	1
a	1
struggle,	1
leaving	1
the	1
right	1
shoulder	1
bare,	1
but	1
the	1
wound	1
from	1
which	1
the	1
blood	1
was	1
welling	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side.	1
The	1
brass	1
dagger	1
lay	1
flat	1
and	1
gleaming	1
a	1
yard	1
or	1
so	1
away.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
blank	1
stillness	1
for	1
a	1
measurable	1
time,	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
hear	1
far	1
off	1
a	1
flower-girl's	1
laugh	1
outside	1
Charing	1
Cross,	1
and	1
someone	1
whistling	1
furiously	1
for	1
a	1
taxicab	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
streets	1
off	1
the	1
Strand.	1
Then	1
the	1
Captain,	1
with	1
a	1
movement	1
so	1
sudden	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
passion	1
or	1
play-acting,	1
took	1
Sir	1
Wilson	1
Seymour	1
by	1
the	1
throat.	1
Seymour	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
steadily	1
without	1
either	1
fight	1
or	1
fear.	1
"You	1
need	1
not	1
kill	1
me,"	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
quite	1
cold;	1
"I	1
shall	1
do	1
that	1
on	1
my	1
own	1
account."	1
The	1
Captain's	1
hand	1
hesitated	1
and	1
dropped;	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
added	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
icy	1
candour:	1
"If	1
I	1
find	1
I	1
haven't	1
the	1
nerve	1
to	1
do	1
it	1
with	1
that	1
dagger	1
I	1
can	1
do	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
month	1
with	1
drink."	1
"Drink	1
isn't	1
good	1
enough	1
for	1
me,"	1
replied	1
Cutler,	1
"but	1
I'll	1
have	1
blood	1
for	1
this	1
before	1
I	1
die.	1
Not	1
yours--but	1
I	1
think	1
I	1
know	1
whose."	1
And	1
before	1
the	1
others	1
could	1
appreciate	1
his	1
intention	1
he	1
snatched	1
up	1
the	1
dagger,	1
sprang	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
door	1
at	1
the	1
lower	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
passage,	1
burst	1
it	1
open,	1
bolt	1
and	1
all,	1
and	1
confronted	1
Bruno	1
in	1
his	1
dressing-room.	1
As	1
he	1
did	1
so,	1
old	1
Parkinson	1
tottered	1
in	1
his	1
wavering	1
way	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
caught	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
corpse	1
lying	1
in	1
the	1
passage.	1
He	1
moved	1
shakily	1
towards	1
it;	1
looked	1
at	1
it	1
weakly	1
with	1
a	1
working	1
face;	1
then	1
moved	1
shakily	1
back	1
into	1
the	1
dressing-room	1
again,	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
suddenly	1
on	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
richly	1
cushioned	1
chairs.	1
Father	1
Brown	1
instantly	1
ran	1
across	1
to	1
him,	1
taking	1
no	1
notice	1
of	1
Cutler	1
and	1
the	1
colossal	1
actor,	1
though	1
the	1
room	1
already	1
rang	1
with	1
their	1
blows	1
and	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
struggle	1
for	1
the	1
dagger.	1
Seymour,	1
who	1
retained	1
some	1
practical	1
sense,	1
was	1
whistling	1
for	1
the	1
police	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
passage.	1
When	1
the	1
police	1
arrived	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
tear	1
the	1
two	1
men	1
from	1
an	1
almost	1
ape-like	1
grapple;	1
and,	1
after	1
a	1
few	1
formal	1
inquiries,	1
to	1
arrest	1
Isidore	1
Bruno	1
upon	1
a	1
charge	1
of	1
murder,	1
brought	1
against	1
him	1
by	1
his	1
furious	1
opponent.	1
The	1
idea	1
that	1
the	1
great	1
national	1
hero	1
of	1
the	1
hour	1
had	1
arrested	1
a	1
wrongdoer	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
hand	1
doubtless	1
had	1
its	1
weight	1
with	1
the	1
police,	1
who	1
are	1
not	1
without	1
elements	1
of	1
the	1
journalist.	1
They	1
treated	1
Cutler	1
with	1
a	1
certain	1
solemn	1
attention,	1
and	1
pointed	1
out	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
got	1
a	1
slight	1
slash	1
on	1
the	1
hand.	1
Even	1
as	1
Cutler	1
bore	1
him	1
back	1
across	1
tilted	1
chair	1
and	1
table,	1
Bruno	1
had	1
twisted	1
the	1
dagger	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
grasp	1
and	1
disabled	1
him	1
just	1
below	1
the	1
wrist.	1
The	1
injury	1
was	1
really	1
slight,	1
but	1
till	1
he	1
was	1
removed	1
from	1
the	1
room	1
the	1
half-savage	1
prisoner	1
stared	1
at	1
the	1
running	1
blood	1
with	1
a	1
steady	1
smile.	1
"Looks	1
a	1
cannibal	1
sort	1
of	1
chap,	1
don't	1
he?"	1
said	1
the	1
constable	1
confidentially	1
to	1
Cutler.	1
Cutler	1
made	1
no	1
answer,	1
but	1
said	1
sharply	1
a	1
moment	1
after:	1
"We	1
must	1
attend	1
to	1
the...the	1
death..."	1
and	1
his	1
voice	1
escaped	1
from	1
articulation.	1
"The	1
two	1
deaths,"	1
came	1
in	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
priest	1
from	1
the	1
farther	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
room.	1
"This	1
poor	1
fellow	1
was	1
gone	1
when	1
I	1
got	1
across	1
to	1
him."	1
And	1
he	1
stood	1
looking	1
down	1
at	1
old	1
Parkinson,	1
who	1
sat	1
in	1
a	1
black	1
huddle	1
on	1
the	1
gorgeous	1
chair.	1
He	1
also	1
had	1
paid	1
his	1
tribute,	1
not	1
without	1
eloquence,	1
to	1
the	1
woman	1
who	1
had	1
died.	1
The	1
silence	1
was	1
first	1
broken	1
by	1
Cutler,	1
who	1
seemed	1
not	1
untouched	1
by	1
a	1
rough	1
tenderness.	1
"I	1
wish	1
I	1
was	1
him,"	1
he	1
said	1
huskily.	1
"I	1
remember	1
he	1
used	1
to	1
watch	1
her	1
wherever	1
she	1
walked	1
more	1
than--anybody.	1
She	1
was	1
his	1
air,	1
and	1
he's	1
dried	1
up.	1
He's	1
just	1
dead."	1
"We	1
are	1
all	1
dead,"	1
said	1
Seymour	1
in	1
a	1
strange	1
voice,	1
looking	1
down	1
the	1
road.	1
They	1
took	1
leave	1
of	1
Father	1
Brown	1
at	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
road,	1
with	1
some	1
random	1
apologies	1
for	1
any	1
rudeness	1
they	1
might	1
have	1
shown.	1
Both	1
their	1
faces	1
were	1
tragic,	1
but	1
also	1
cryptic.	1
The	1
mind	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
priest	1
was	1
always	1
a	1
rabbit-warren	1
of	1
wild	1
thoughts	1
that	1
jumped	1
too	1
quickly	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
catch	1
them.	1
Like	1
the	1
white	1
tail	1
of	1
a	1
rabbit	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
vanishing	1
thought	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
certain	1
of	1
their	1
grief,	1
but	1
not	1
so	1
certain	1
of	1
their	1
innocence.	1
"We	1
had	1
better	1
all	1
be	1
going,"	1
said	1
Seymour	1
heavily;	1
"we	1
have	1
done	1
all	1
we	1
can	1
to	1
help."	1
"Will	1
you	1
understand	1
my	1
motives,"	1
asked	1
Father	1
Brown	1
quietly,	1
"if	1
I	1
say	1
you	1
have	1
done	1
all	1
you	1
can	1
to	1
hurt?"	1
They	1
both	1
started	1
as	1
if	1
guiltily,	1
and	1
Cutler	1
said	1
sharply:	1
"To	1
hurt	1
whom?"	1
"To	1
hurt	1
yourselves,"	1
answered	1
the	1
priest.	1
"I	1
would	1
not	1
add	1
to	1
your	1
troubles	1
if	1
it	1
weren't	1
common	1
justice	1
to	1
warn	1
you.	1
You've	1
done	1
nearly	1
everything	1
you	1
could	1
do	1
to	1
hang	1
yourselves,	1
if	1
this	1
actor	1
should	1
be	1
acquitted.	1
They'll	1
be	1
sure	1
to	1
subpoena	1
me;	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
bound	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
after	1
the	1
cry	1
was	1
heard	1
each	1
of	1
you	1
rushed	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
in	1
a	1
wild	1
state	1
and	1
began	1
quarrelling	1
about	1
a	1
dagger.	1
As	1
far	1
as	1
my	1
words	1
on	1
oath	1
can	1
go,	1
you	1
might	1
either	1
of	1
you	1
have	1
done	1
it.	1
You	1
hurt	1
yourselves	1
with	1
that;	1
and	1
then	1
Captain	1
Cutler	1
must	1
have	1
hurt	1
himself	1
with	1
the	1
dagger."	1
"Hurt	1
myself!"	1
exclaimed	1
the	1
Captain,	1
with	1
contempt.	1
"A	1
silly	1
little	1
scratch."	1
"Which	1
drew	1
blood,"	1
replied	1
the	1
priest,	1
nodding.	1
"We	1
know	1
there's	1
blood	1
on	1
the	1
brass	1
now.	1
And	1
so	1
we	1
shall	1
never	1
know	1
whether	1
there	1
was	1
blood	1
on	1
it	1
before."	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
silence;	1
and	1
then	1
Seymour	1
said,	1
with	1
an	1
emphasis	1
quite	1
alien	1
to	1
his	1
daily	1
accent:	1
"But	1
I	1
saw	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
passage."	1
"I	1
know	1
you	1
did,"	1
answered	1
the	1
cleric	1
Brown	1
with	1
a	1
face	1
of	1
wood,	1
"so	1
did	1
Captain	1
Cutler.	1
That's	1
what	1
seems	1
so	1
improbable."	1
Before	1
either	1
could	1
make	1
sufficient	1
sense	1
of	1
it	1
even	1
to	1
answer,	1
Father	1
Brown	1
had	1
politely	1
excused	1
himself	1
and	1
gone	1
stumping	1
up	1
the	1
road	1
with	1
his	1
stumpy	1
old	1
umbrella.	1
As	1
modern	1
newspapers	1
are	1
conducted,	1
the	1
most	1
honest	1
and	1
most	1
important	1
news	1
is	1
the	1
police	1
news.	1
If	1
it	1
be	1
true	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
twentieth	1
century	1
more	1
space	1
is	1
given	1
to	1
murder	1
than	1
to	1
politics,	1
it	1
is	1
for	1
the	1
excellent	1
reason	1
that	1
murder	1
is	1
a	1
more	1
serious	1
subject.	1
But	1
even	1
this	1
would	1
hardly	1
explain	1
the	1
enormous	1
omnipresence	1
and	1
widely	1
distributed	1
detail	1
of	1
"The	1
Bruno	1
Case,"	1
or	1
"The	1
Passage	1
Mystery,"	1
in	1
the	1
Press	1
of	1
London	1
and	1
the	1
provinces.	1
So	1
vast	1
was	1
the	1
excitement	1
that	1
for	1
some	1
weeks	1
the	1
Press	1
really	1
told	1
the	1
truth;	1
and	1
the	1
reports	1
of	1
examination	1
and	1
cross-examination,	1
if	1
interminable,	1
even	1
if	1
intolerable	1
are	1
at	1
least	1
reliable.	1
The	1
true	1
reason,	1
of	1
course,	1
was	1
the	1
coincidence	1
of	1
persons.	1
The	1
victim	1
was	1
a	1
popular	1
actress;	1
the	1
accused	1
was	1
a	1
popular	1
actor;	1
and	1
the	1
accused	1
had	1
been	1
caught	1
red-handed,	1
as	1
it	1
were,	1
by	1
the	1
most	1
popular	1
soldier	1
of	1
the	1
patriotic	1
season.	1
In	1
those	1
extraordinary	1
circumstances	1
the	1
Press	1
was	1
paralysed	1
into	1
probity	1
and	1
accuracy;	1
and	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
this	1
somewhat	1
singular	1
business	1
can	1
practically	1
be	1
recorded	1
from	1
reports	1
of	1
Bruno's	1
trial.	1
The	1
trial	1
was	1
presided	1
over	1
by	1
Mr	1
Justice	1
Monkhouse,	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
jeered	1
at	1
as	1
humorous	1
judges,	1
but	1
who	1
are	1
generally	1
much	1
more	1
serious	1
than	1
the	1
serious	1
judges,	1
for	1
their	1
levity	1
comes	1
from	1
a	1
living	1
impatience	1
of	1
professional	1
solemnity;	1
while	1
the	1
serious	1
judge	1
is	1
really	1
filled	1
with	1
frivolity,	1
because	1
he	1
is	1
filled	1
with	1
vanity.	1
All	1
the	1
chief	1
actors	1
being	1
of	1
a	1
worldly	1
importance,	1
the	1
barristers	1
were	1
well	1
balanced;	1
the	1
prosecutor	1
for	1
the	1
Crown	1
was	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
Cowdray,	1
a	1
heavy,	1
but	1
weighty	1
advocate	1
of	1
the	1
sort	1
that	1
knows	1
how	1
to	1
seem	1
English	1
and	1
trustworthy,	1
and	1
how	1
to	1
be	1
rhetorical	1
with	1
reluctance.	1
The	1
prisoner	1
was	1
defended	1
by	1
Mr	1
Patrick	1
Butler,	1
K.C.,	1
who	1
was	1
mistaken	1
for	1
a	1
mere	1
flaneur	1
by	1
those	1
who	1
misunderstood	1
the	1
Irish	1
character--	1
and	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
examined	1
by	1
him.	1
The	1
medical	1
evidence	1
involved	1
no	1
contradictions,	1
the	1
doctor,	1
whom	1
Seymour	1
had	1
summoned	1
on	1
the	1
spot,	1
agreeing	1
with	1
the	1
eminent	1
surgeon	1
who	1
had	1
later	1
examined	1
the	1
body.	1
Aurora	1
Rome	1
had	1
been	1
stabbed	1
with	1
some	1
sharp	1
instrument	1
such	1
as	1
a	1
knife	1
or	1
dagger;	1
some	1
instrument,	1
at	1
least,	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
blade	1
was	1
short.	1
The	1
wound	1
was	1
just	1
over	1
the	1
heart,	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
died	1
instantly.	1
When	1
the	1
doctor	1
first	1
saw	1
her	1
she	1
could	1
hardly	1
have	1
been	1
dead	1
for	1
twenty	1
minutes.	1
Therefore	1
when	1
Father	1
Brown	1
found	1
her	1
she	1
could	1
hardly	1
have	1
been	1
dead	1
for	1
three.	1
Some	1
official	1
detective	1
evidence	1
followed,	1
chiefly	1
concerned	1
with	1
the	1
presence	1
or	1
absence	1
of	1
any	1
proof	1
of	1
a	1
struggle;	1
the	1
only	1
suggestion	1
of	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
tearing	1
of	1
the	1
dress	1
at	1
the	1
shoulder,	1
and	1
this	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
fit	1
in	1
particularly	1
well	1
with	1
the	1
direction	1
and	1
finality	1
of	1
the	1
blow.	1
When	1
these	1
details	1
had	1
been	1
supplied,	1
though	1
not	1
explained,	1
the	1
first	1
of	1
the	1
important	1
witnesses	1
was	1
called.	1
Sir	1
Wilson	1
Seymour	1
gave	1
evidence	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
everything	1
else	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
at	1
all--not	1
only	1
well,	1
but	1
perfectly.	1
Though	1
himself	1
much	1
more	1
of	1
a	1
public	1
man	1
than	1
the	1
judge,	1
he	1
conveyed	1
exactly	1
the	1
fine	1
shade	1
of	1
self-effacement	1
before	1
the	1
King's	1
justice;	1
and	1
though	1
everyone	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
as	1
they	1
would	1
at	1
the	1
Prime	1
Minister	1
or	1
the	1
Archbishop	1
of	1
Canterbury,	1
they	1
could	1
have	1
said	1
nothing	1
of	1
his	1
part	1
in	1
it	1
but	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
private	1
gentleman,	1
with	1
an	1
accent	1
on	1
the	1
noun.	1
He	1
was	1
also	1
refreshingly	1
lucid,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
committees.	1
He	1
had	1
been	1
calling	1
on	1
Miss	1
Rome	1
at	1
the	1
theatre;	1
he	1
had	1
met	1
Captain	1
Cutler	1
there;	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
joined	1
for	1
a	1
short	1
time	1
by	1
the	1
accused,	1
who	1
had	1
then	1
returned	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
dressing-room;	1
they	1
had	1
then	1
been	1
joined	1
by	1
a	1
Roman	1
Catholic	1
priest,	1
who	1
asked	1
for	1
the	1
deceased	1
lady	1
and	1
said	1
his	1
name	1
was	1
Brown.	1
Miss	1
Rome	1
had	1
then	1
gone	1
just	1
outside	1
the	1
theatre	1
to	1
the	1
entrance	1
of	1
the	1
passage,	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
point	1
out	1
to	1
Captain	1
Cutler	1
a	1
flower-shop	1
at	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
buy	1
her	1
some	1
more	1
flowers;	1
and	1
the	1
witness	1
had	1
remained	1
in	1
the	1
room,	1
exchanging	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
with	1
the	1
priest.	1
He	1
had	1
then	1
distinctly	1
heard	1
the	1
deceased,	1
having	1
sent	1
the	1
Captain	1
on	1
his	1
errand,	1
turn	1
round	1
laughing	1
and	1
run	1
down	1
the	1
passage	1
towards	1
its	1
other	1
end,	1
where	1
was	1
the	1
prisoner's	1
dressing-room.	1
In	1
idle	1
curiosity	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
rapid	1
movement	1
of	1
his	1
friends,	1
he	1
had	1
strolled	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
passage	1
himself	1
and	1
looked	1
down	1
it	1
towards	1
the	1
prisoner's	1
door.	1
Did	1
he	1
see	1
anything	1
in	1
the	1
passage?	1
Yes;	1
he	1
saw	1
something	1
in	1
the	1
passage.	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
Cowdray	1
allowed	1
an	1
impressive	1
interval,	1
during	1
which	1
the	1
witness	1
looked	1
down,	1
and	1
for	1
all	1
his	1
usual	1
composure	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
more	1
than	1
his	1
usual	1
pallor.	1
Then	1
the	1
barrister	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
lower	1
voice,	1
which	1
seemed	1
at	1
once	1
sympathetic	1
and	1
creepy:	1
"Did	1
you	1
see	1
it	1
distinctly?"	1
Sir	1
Wilson	1
Seymour,	1
however	1
moved,	1
had	1
his	1
excellent	1
brains	1
in	1
full	1
working-order.	1
"Very	1
distinctly	1
as	1
regards	1
its	1
outline,	1
but	1
quite	1
indistinctly,	1
indeed	1
not	1
at	1
all,	1
as	1
regards	1
the	1
details	1
inside	1
the	1
outline.	1
The	1
passage	1
is	1
of	1
such	1
length	1
that	1
anyone	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
it	1
appears	1
quite	1
black	1
against	1
the	1
light	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
end."	1
The	1
witness	1
lowered	1
his	1
steady	1
eyes	1
once	1
more	1
and	1
added:	1
"I	1
had	1
noticed	1
the	1
fact	1
before,	1
when	1
Captain	1
Cutler	1
first	1
entered	1
it."	1
There	1
was	1
another	1
silence,	1
and	1
the	1
judge	1
leaned	1
forward	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
note.	1
"Well,"	1
said	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
patiently,	1
"what	1
was	1
the	1
outline	1
like?	1
Was	1
it,	1
for	1
instance,	1
like	1
the	1
figure	1
of	1
the	1
murdered	1
woman?"	1
"Not	1
in	1
the	1
least,"	1
answered	1
Seymour	1
quietly.	1
"What	1
did	1
it	1
look	1
like	1
to	1
you?"	1
"It	1
looked	1
to	1
me,"	1
replied	1
the	1
witness,	1
"like	1
a	1
tall	1
man."	1
Everyone	1
in	1
court	1
kept	1
his	1
eyes	1
riveted	1
on	1
his	1
pen,	1
or	1
his	1
umbrella-handle,	1
or	1
his	1
book,	1
or	1
his	1
boots	1
or	1
whatever	1
he	1
happened	1
to	1
be	1
looking	1
at.	1
They	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
holding	1
their	1
eyes	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
prisoner	1
by	1
main	1
force;	1
but	1
they	1
felt	1
his	1
figure	1
in	1
the	1
dock,	1
and	1
they	1
felt	1
it	1
as	1
gigantic.	1
Tall	1
as	1
Bruno	1
was	1
to	1
the	1
eye,	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
swell	1
taller	1
and	1
taller	1
when	1
an	1
eyes	1
had	1
been	1
torn	1
away	1
from	1
him.	1
Cowdray	1
was	1
resuming	1
his	1
seat	1
with	1
his	1
solemn	1
face,	1
smoothing	1
his	1
black	1
silk	1
robes,	1
and	1
white	1
silk	1
whiskers.	1
Sir	1
Wilson	1
was	1
leaving	1
the	1
witness-box,	1
after	1
a	1
few	1
final	1
particulars	1
to	1
which	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
other	1
witnesses,	1
when	1
the	1
counsel	1
for	1
the	1
defence	1
sprang	1
up	1
and	1
stopped	1
him.	1
"I	1
shall	1
only	1
detain	1
you	1
a	1
moment,"	1
said	1
Mr	1
Butler,	1
who	1
was	1
a	1
rustic-looking	1
person	1
with	1
red	1
eyebrows	1
and	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
partial	1
slumber.	1
"Will	1
you	1
tell	1
his	1
lordship	1
how	1
you	1
knew	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
man?"	1
A	1
faint,	1
refined	1
smile	1
seemed	1
to	1
pass	1
over	1
Seymour's	1
features.	1
"I'm	1
afraid	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
vulgar	1
test	1
of	1
trousers,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"When	1
I	1
saw	1
daylight	1
between	1
the	1
long	1
legs	1
I	1
was	1
sure	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
man,	1
after	1
all."	1
Butler's	1
sleepy	1
eyes	1
opened	1
as	1
suddenly	1
as	1
some	1
silent	1
explosion.	1
"After	1
all!"	1
he	1
repeated	1
slowly.	1
"So	1
you	1
did	1
think	1
at	1
first	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
woman?"	1
Seymour	1
looked	1
troubled	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time.	1
"It	1
is	1
hardly	1
a	1
point	1
of	1
fact,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"but	1
if	1
his	1
lordship	1
would	1
like	1
me	1
to	1
answer	1
for	1
my	1
impression,	1
of	1
course	1
I	1
shall	1
do	1
so.	1
There	1
was	1
something	1
about	1
the	1
thing	1
that	1
was	1
not	1
exactly	1
a	1
woman	1
and	1
yet	1
was	1
not	1
quite	1
a	1
man;	1
somehow	1
the	1
curves	1
were	1
different.	1
And	1
it	1
had	1
something	1
that	1
looked	1
like	1
long	1
hair."	1
"Thank	1
you,"	1
said	1
Mr	1
Butler,	1
K.C.,	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
suddenly,	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
got	1
what	1
he	1
wanted.	1
Captain	1
Cutler	1
was	1
a	1
far	1
less	1
plausible	1
and	1
composed	1
witness	1
than	1
Sir	1
Wilson,	1
but	1
his	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
opening	1
incidents	1
was	1
solidly	1
the	1
same.	1
He	1
described	1
the	1
return	1
of	1
Bruno	1
to	1
his	1
dressing-room,	1
the	1
dispatching	1
of	1
himself	1
to	1
buy	1
a	1
bunch	1
of	1
lilies-of-the-valley,	1
his	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
upper	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
passage,	1
the	1
thing	1
he	1
saw	1
in	1
the	1
passage,	1
his	1
suspicion	1
of	1
Seymour,	1
and	1
his	1
struggle	1
with	1
Bruno.	1
But	1
he	1
could	1
give	1
little	1
artistic	1
assistance	1
about	1
the	1
black	1
figure	1
that	1
he	1
and	1
Seymour	1
had	1
seen.	1
Asked	1
about	1
its	1
outline,	1
he	1
said	1
he	1
was	1
no	1
art	1
critic--with	1
a	1
somewhat	1
too	1
obvious	1
sneer	1
at	1
Seymour.	1
Asked	1
if	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
or	1
a	1
woman,	1
he	1
said	1
it	1
looked	1
more	1
like	1
a	1
beast--	1
with	1
a	1
too	1
obvious	1
snarl	1
at	1
the	1
prisoner.	1
But	1
the	1
man	1
was	1
plainly	1
shaken	1
with	1
sorrow	1
and	1
sincere	1
anger,	1
and	1
Cowdray	1
quickly	1
excused	1
him	1
from	1
confirming	1
facts	1
that	1
were	1
already	1
fairly	1
clear.	1
The	1
defending	1
counsel	1
also	1
was	1
again	1
brief	1
in	1
his	1
cross-examination;	1
although	1
(as	1
was	1
his	1
custom)	1
even	1
in	1
being	1
brief,	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
about	1
it.	1
"You	1
used	1
a	1
rather	1
remarkable	1
expression,"	1
he	1
said,	1
looking	1
at	1
Cutler	1
sleepily.	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
mean	1
by	1
saying	1
that	1
it	1
looked	1
more	1
like	1
a	1
beast	1
than	1
a	1
man	1
or	1
a	1
woman?"	1
Cutler	1
seemed	1
seriously	1
agitated.	1
"Perhaps	1
I	1
oughtn't	1
to	1
have	1
said	1
that,"	1
he	1
said;	1
"but	1
when	1
the	1
brute	1
has	1
huge	1
humped	1
shoulders	1
like	1
a	1
chimpanzee,	1
and	1
bristles	1
sticking	1
out	1
of	1
its	1
head	1
like	1
a	1
pig--"	1
Mr	1
Butler	1
cut	1
short	1
his	1
curious	1
impatience	1
in	1
the	1
middle.	1
"Never	1
mind	1
whether	1
its	1
hair	1
was	1
like	1
a	1
pig's,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"was	1
it	1
like	1
a	1
woman's?"	1
"A	1
woman's!"	1
cried	1
the	1
soldier.	1
"Great	1
Scott,	1
no!"	1
"The	1
last	1
witness	1
said	1
it	1
was,"	1
commented	1
the	1
counsel,	1
with	1
unscrupulous	1
swiftness.	1
"And	1
did	1
the	1
figure	1
have	1
any	1
of	1
those	1
serpentine	1
and	1
semi-feminine	1
curves	1
to	1
which	1
eloquent	1
allusion	1
has	1
been	1
made?	1
No?	1
No	1
feminine	1
curves?	1
The	1
figure,	1
if	1
I	1
understand	1
you,	1
was	1
rather	1
heavy	1
and	1
square	1
than	1
otherwise?"	1
"He	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
bending	1
forward,"	1
said	1
Cutler,	1
in	1
a	1
hoarse	1
and	1
rather	1
faint	1
voice.	1
"Or	1
again,	1
he	1
may	1
not,"	1
said	1
Mr	1
Butler,	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
suddenly	1
for	1
the	1
second	1
time.	1
The	1
third,	1
witness	1
called	1
by	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
Cowdray	1
was	1
the	1
little	1
Catholic	1
clergyman,	1
so	1
little,	1
compared	1
with	1
the	1
others,	1
that	1
his	1
head	1
seemed	1
hardly	1
to	1
come	1
above	1
the	1
box,	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
like	1
cross-examining	1
a	1
child.	1
But	1
unfortunately	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
had	1
somehow	1
got	1
it	1
into	1
his	1
head	1
(mostly	1
by	1
some	1
ramifications	1
of	1
his	1
family's	1
religion)	1
that	1
Father	1
Brown	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
prisoner,	1
because	1
the	1
prisoner	1
was	1
wicked	1
and	1
foreign	1
and	1
even	1
partly	1
black.	1
Therefore	1
he	1
took	1
Father	1
Brown	1
up	1
sharply	1
whenever	1
that	1
proud	1
pontiff	1
tried	1
to	1
explain	1
anything;	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
to	1
answer	1
yes	1
or	1
no,	1
and	1
tell	1
the	1
plain	1
facts	1
without	1
any	1
jesuitry.	1
When	1
Father	1
Brown	1
began,	1
in	1
his	1
simplicity,	1
to	1
say	1
who	1
he	1
thought	1
the	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
passage	1
was,	1
the	1
barrister	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
his	1
theories.	1
"A	1
black	1
shape	1
was	1
seen	1
in	1
the	1
passage.	1
And	1
you	1
say	1
you	1
saw	1
the	1
black	1
shape.	1
Well,	1
what	1
shape	1
was	1
it?"	1
Father	1
Brown	1
blinked	1
as	1
under	1
rebuke;	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
long	1
known	1
the	1
literal	1
nature	1
of	1
obedience.	1
"The	1
shape,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"was	1
short	1
and	1
thick,	1
but	1
had	1
two	1
sharp,	1
black	1
projections	1
curved	1
upwards	1
on	1
each	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
head	1
or	1
top,	1
rather	1
like	1
horns,	1
and--"	1
"Oh!	1
the	1
devil	1
with	1
horns,	1
no	1
doubt,"	1
ejaculated	1
Cowdray,	1
sitting	1
down	1
in	1
triumphant	1
jocularity.	1
"It	1
was	1
the	1
devil	1
come	1
to	1
eat	1
Protestants."	1
"No,"	1
said	1
the	1
priest	1
dispassionately;	1
"I	1
know	1
who	1
it	1
was."	1
Those	1
in	1
court	1
had	1
been	1
wrought	1
up	1
to	1
an	1
irrational,	1
but	1
real	1
sense	1
of	1
some	1
monstrosity.	1
They	1
had	1
forgotten	1
the	1
figure	1
in	1
the	1
dock	1
and	1
thought	1
only	1
of	1
the	1
figure	1
in	1
the	1
passage.	1
And	1
the	1
figure	1
in	1
the	1
passage,	1
described	1
by	1
three	1
capable	1
and	1
respectable	1
men	1
who	1
had	1
all	1
seen	1
it,	1
was	1
a	1
shifting	1
nightmare:	1
one	1
called	1
it	1
a	1
woman,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
a	1
beast,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
a	1
devil....	1
The	1
judge	1
was	1
looking	1
at	1
Father	1
Brown	1
with	1
level	1
and	1
piercing	1
eyes.	1
"You	1
are	1
a	1
most	1
extraordinary	1
witness,"	1
he	1
said;	1
"but	1
there	1
is	1
something	1
about	1
you	1
that	1
makes	1
me	1
think	1
you	1
are	1
trying	1
to	1
tell	1
the	1
truth.	1
Well,	1
who	1
was	1
the	1
man	1
you	1
saw	1
in	1
the	1
passage?"	1
"He	1
was	1
myself,"	1
said	1
Father	1
Brown.	1
Butler,	1
K.C.,	1
sprang	1
to	1
his	1
feet	1
in	1
an	1
extraordinary	1
stillness,	1
and	1
said	1
quite	1
calmly:	1
"Your	1
lordship	1
will	1
allow	1
me	1
to	1
cross-examine?"	1
And	1
then,	1
without	1
stopping,	1
he	1
shot	1
at	1
Brown	1
the	1
apparently	1
disconnected	1
question:	1
"You	1
have	1
heard	1
about	1
this	1
dagger;	1
you	1
know	1
the	1
experts	1
say	1
the	1
crime	1
was	1
committed	1
with	1
a	1
short	1
blade?"	1
"A	1
short	1
blade,"	1
assented	1
Brown,	1
nodding	1
solemnly	1
like	1
an	1
owl,	1
"but	1
a	1
very	1
long	1
hilt."	1
Before	1
the	1
audience	1
could	1
quite	1
dismiss	1
the	1
idea	1
that	1
the	1
priest	1
had	1
really	1
seen	1
himself	1
doing	1
murder	1
with	1
a	1
short	1
dagger	1
with	1
a	1
long	1
hilt	1
(which	1
seemed	1
somehow	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
more	1
horrible),	1
he	1
had	1
himself	1
hurried	1
on	1
to	1
explain.	1
"I	1
mean	1
daggers	1
aren't	1
the	1
only	1
things	1
with	1
short	1
blades.	1
Spears	1
have	1
short	1
blades.	1
And	1
spears	1
catch	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
steel	1
just	1
like	1
daggers,	1
if	1
they're	1
that	1
sort	1
of	1
fancy	1
spear	1
they	1
had	1
in	1
theatres;	1
like	1
the	1
spear	1
poor	1
old	1
Parkinson	1
killed	1
his	1
wife	1
with,	1
just	1
when	1
she'd	1
sent	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
settle	1
their	1
family	1
troubles--	1
and	1
I	1
came	1
just	1
too	1
late,	1
God	1
forgive	1
me!	1
But	1
he	1
died	1
penitent--	1
he	1
just	1
died	1
of	1
being	1
penitent.	1
He	1
couldn't	1
bear	1
what	1
he'd	1
done."	1
The	1
general	1
impression	1
in	1
court	1
was	1
that	1
the	1
little	1
priest,	1
who	1
was	1
gobbling	1
away,	1
had	1
literally	1
gone	1
mad	1
in	1
the	1
box.	1
But	1
the	1
judge	1
still	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
bright	1
and	1
steady	1
eyes	1
of	1
interest;	1
and	1
the	1
counsel	1
for	1
the	1
defence	1
went	1
on	1
with	1
his	1
questions	1
unperturbed.	1
"If	1
Parkinson	1
did	1
it	1
with	1
that	1
pantomime	1
spear,"	1
said	1
Butler,	1
"he	1
must	1
have	1
thrust	1
from	1
four	1
yards	1
away.	1
How	1
do	1
you	1
account	1
for	1
signs	1
of	1
struggle,	1
like	1
the	1
dress	1
dragged	1
off	1
the	1
shoulder?"	1
He	1
had	1
slipped	1
into	1
treating	1
his	1
mere	1
witness	1
as	1
an	1
expert;	1
but	1
no	1
one	1
noticed	1
it	1
now.	1
"The	1
poor	1
lady's	1
dress	1
was	1
torn,"	1
said	1
the	1
witness,	1
"because	1
it	1
was	1
caught	1
in	1
a	1
panel	1
that	1
slid	1
to	1
just	1
behind	1
her.	1
She	1
struggled	1
to	1
free	1
herself,	1
and	1
as	1
she	1
did	1
so	1
Parkinson	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
prisoner's	1
room	1
and	1
lunged	1
with	1
the	1
spear."	1
"A	1
panel?"	1
repeated	1
the	1
barrister	1
in	1
a	1
curious	1
voice.	1
"It	1
was	1
a	1
looking-glass	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side,"	1
explained	1
Father	1
Brown.	1
"When	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
dressing-room	1
I	1
noticed	1
that	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
could	1
probably	1
be	1
slid	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
passage."	1
There	1
was	1
another	1
vast	1
and	1
unnatural	1
silence,	1
and	1
this	1
time	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
judge	1
who	1
spoke.	1
"So	1
you	1
really	1
mean	1
that	1
when	1
you	1
looked	1
down	1
that	1
passage,	1
the	1
man	1
you	1
saw	1
was	1
yourself--in	1
a	1
mirror?"	1
"Yes,	1
my	1
lord;	1
that	1
was	1
what	1
I	1
was	1
trying	1
to	1
say,"	1
said	1
Brown,	1
"but	1
they	1
asked	1
me	1
for	1
the	1
shape;	1
and	1
our	1
hats	1
have	1
corners	1
just	1
like	1
horns,	1
and	1
so	1
I--"	1
The	1
judge	1
leaned	1
forward,	1
his	1
old	1
eyes	1
yet	1
more	1
brilliant,	1
and	1
said	1
in	1
specially	1
distinct	1
tones:	1
"Do	1
you	1
really	1
mean	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
when	1
Sir	1
Wilson	1
Seymour	1
saw	1
that	1
wild	1
what-you-call-him	1
with	1
curves	1
and	1
a	1
woman's	1
hair	1
and	1
a	1
man's	1
trousers,	1
what	1
he	1
saw	1
was	1
Sir	1
Wilson	1
Seymour?"	1
"Yes,	1
my	1
lord,"	1
said	1
Father	1
Brown.	1
"And	1
you	1
mean	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
when	1
Captain	1
Cutler	1
saw	1
that	1
chimpanzee	1
with	1
humped	1
shoulders	1
and	1
hog's	1
bristles,	1
he	1
simply	1
saw	1
himself?"	1
"Yes,	1
my	1
lord."	1
The	1
judge	1
leaned	1
back	1
in	1
his	1
chair	1
with	1
a	1
luxuriance	1
in	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
hard	1
to	1
separate	1
the	1
cynicism	1
and	1
the	1
admiration.	1
"And	1
can	1
you	1
tell	1
us	1
why,"	1
he	1
asked,	1
"you	1
should	1
know	1
your	1
own	1
figure	1
in	1
a	1
looking-glass,	1
when	1
two	1
such	1
distinguished	1
men	1
don't?"	1
Father	1
Brown	1
blinked	1
even	1
more	1
painfully	1
than	1
before;	1
then	1
he	1
stammered:	1
"Really,	1
my	1
lord,	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
unless	1
it's	1
because	1
I	1
don't	1
look	1
at	1
it	1
so	1
often."	1
V.	1
The	1
Mistake	1
of	1
the	1
Machine	1
FLAMBEAU	1
and	1
his	1
friend	1
the	1
priest	1
were	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
Temple	1
Gardens	1
about	1
sunset;	1
and	1
their	1
neighbourhood	1
or	1
some	1
such	1
accidental	1
influence	1
had	1
turned	1
their	1
talk	1
to	1
matters	1
of	1
legal	1
process.	1
From	1
the	1
problem	1
of	1
the	1
licence	1
in	1
cross-examination,	1
their	1
talk	1
strayed	1
to	1
Roman	1
and	1
mediaeval	1
torture,	1
to	1
the	1
examining	1
magistrate	1
in	1
France	1
and	1
the	1
Third	1
Degree	1
in	1
America.	1
"I've	1
been	1
reading,"	1
said	1
Flambeau,	1
"of	1
this	1
new	1
psychometric	1
method	1
they	1
talk	1
about	1
so	1
much,	1
especially	1
in	1
America.	1
You	1
know	1
what	1
I	1
mean;	1
they	1
put	1
a	1
pulsometer	1
on	1
a	1
man's	1
wrist	1
and	1
judge	1
by	1
how	1
his	1
heart	1
goes	1
at	1
the	1
pronunciation	1
of	1
certain	1
words.	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
of	1
it?"	1
"I	1
think	1
it	1
very	1
interesting,"	1
replied	1
Father	1
Brown;	1
"it	1
reminds	1
me	1
of	1
that	1
interesting	1
idea	1
in	1
the	1
Dark	1
Ages	1
that	1
blood	1
would	1
flow	1
from	1
a	1
corpse	1
if	1
the	1
murderer	1
touched	1
it."	1
"Do	1
you	1
really	1
mean,"	1
demanded	1
his	1
friend,	1
"that	1
you	1
think	1
the	1
two	1
methods	1
equally	1
valuable?"	1
"I	1
think	1
them	1
equally	1
valueless,"	1
replied	1
Brown.	1
"Blood	1
flows,	1
fast	1
or	1
slow,	1
in	1
dead	1
folk	1
or	1
living,	1
for	1
so	1
many	1
more	1
million	1
reasons	1
than	1
we	1
can	1
ever	1
know.	1
Blood	1
will	1
have	1
to	1
flow	1
very	1
funnily;	1
blood	1
will	1
have	1
to	1
flow	1
up	1
the	1
Matterhorn,	1
before	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
it	1
as	1
a	1
sign	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
shed	1
it."	1
"The	1
method,"	1
remarked	1
the	1
other,	1
"has	1
been	1
guaranteed	1
by	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
greatest	1
American	1
men	1
of	1
science."	1
"What	1
sentimentalists	1
men	1
of	1
science	1
are!"	1
exclaimed	1
Father	1
Brown,	1
"and	1
how	1
much	1
more	1
sentimental	1
must	1
American	1
men	1
of	1
science	1
be!	1
Who	1
but	1
a	1
Yankee	1
would	1
think	1
of	1
proving	1
anything	1
from	1
heart-throbs?	1
Why,	1
they	1
must	1
be	1
as	1
sentimental	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
thinks	1
a	1
woman	1
is	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
him	1
if	1
she	1
blushes.	1
That's	1
a	1
test	1
from	1
the	1
circulation	1
of	1
the	1
blood,	1
discovered	1
by	1
the	1
immortal	1
Harvey;	1
and	1
a	1
jolly	1
rotten	1
test,	1
too."	1
"But	1
surely,"	1
insisted	1
Flambeau,	1
"it	1
might	1
point	1
pretty	1
straight	1
at	1
something	1
or	1
other."	1
"There's	1
a	1
disadvantage	1
in	1
a	1
stick	1
pointing	1
straight,"	1
answered	1
the	1
other.	1
"What	1
is	1
it?	1
Why,	1
the	1
other	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
stick	1
always	1
points	1
the	1
opposite	1
way.	1
It	1
depends	1
whether	1
you	1
get	1
hold	1
of	1
the	1
stick	1
by	1
the	1
right	1
end.	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
thing	1
done	1
once	1
and	1
I've	1
never	1
believed	1
in	1
it	1
since."	1
And	1
he	1
proceeded	1
to	1
tell	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
his	1
disillusionment.	1
It	1
happened	1
nearly	1
twenty	1
years	1
before,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
chaplain	1
to	1
his	1
co-religionists	1
in	1
a	1
prison	1
in	1
Chicago--where	1
the	1
Irish	1
population	1
displayed	1
a	1
capacity	1
both	1
for	1
crime	1
and	1
penitence	1
which	1
kept	1
him	1
tolerably	1
busy.	1
The	1
official	1
second-in-command	1
under	1
the	1
Governor	1
was	1
an	1
ex-detective	1
named	1
Greywood	1
Usher,	1
a	1
cadaverous,	1
careful-spoken	1
Yankee	1
philosopher,	1
occasionally	1
varying	1
a	1
very	1
rigid	1
visage	1
with	1
an	1
odd	1
apologetic	1
grimace.	1
He	1
liked	1
Father	1
Brown	1
in	1
a	1
slightly	1
patronizing	1
way;	1
and	1
Father	1
Brown	1
liked	1
him,	1
though	1
he	1
heartily	1
disliked	1
his	1
theories.	1
His	1
theories	1
were	1
extremely	1
complicated	1
and	1
were	1
held	1
with	1
extreme	1
simplicity.	1
One	1
evening	1
he	1
had	1
sent	1
for	1
the	1
priest,	1
who,	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
custom,	1
took	1
a	1
seat	1
in	1
silence	1
at	1
a	1
table	1
piled	1
and	1
littered	1
with	1
papers,	1
and	1
waited.	1
The	1
official	1
selected	1
from	1
the	1
papers	1
a	1
scrap	1
of	1
newspaper	1
cutting,	1
which	1
he	1
handed	1
across	1
to	1
the	1
cleric,	1
who	1
read	1
it	1
gravely.	1
It	1
appeared	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
extract	1
from	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
pinkest	1
of	1
American	1
Society	1
papers,	1
and	1
ran	1
as	1
follows:	1
"Society's	1
brightest	1
widower	1
is	1
once	1
more	1
on	1
the	1
Freak	1
Dinner	1
stunt.	1
All	1
our	1
exclusive	1
citizens	1
will	1
recall	1
the	1
Perambulator	1
Parade	1
Dinner,	1
in	1
which	1
Last-Trick	1
Todd,	1
at	1
his	1
palatial	1
home	1
at	1
Pilgrim's	1
Pond,	1
caused	1
so	1
many	1
of	1
our	1
prominent	1
debutantes	1
to	1
look	1
even	1
younger	1
than	1
their	1
years.	1
Equally	1
elegant	1
and	1
more	1
miscellaneous	1
and	1
large-hearted	1
in	1
social	1
outlook	1
was	1
Last-Trick's	1
show	1
the	1
year	1
previous,	1
the	1
popular	1
Cannibal	1
Crush	1
Lunch,	1
at	1
which	1
the	1
confections	1
handed	1
round	1
were	1
sarcastically	1
moulded	1
in	1
the	1
forms	1
of	1
human	1
arms	1
and	1
legs,	1
and	1
during	1
which	1
more	1
than	1
one	1
of	1
our	1
gayest	1
mental	1
gymnasts	1
was	1
heard	1
offering	1
to	1
eat	1
his	1
partner.	1
The	1
witticism	1
which	1
will	1
inspire	1
this	1
evening	1
is	1
as	1
yet	1
in	1
Mr	1
Todd's	1
pretty	1
reticent	1
intellect,	1
or	1
locked	1
in	1
the	1
jewelled	1
bosoms	1
of	1
our	1
city's	1
gayest	1
leaders;	1
but	1
there	1
is	1
talk	1
of	1
a	1
pretty	1
parody	1
of	1
the	1
simple	1
manners	1
and	1
customs	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
end	1
of	1
Society's	1
scale.	1
This	1
would	1
be	1
all	1
the	1
more	1
telling,	1
as	1
hospitable	1
Todd	1
is	1
entertaining	1
in	1
Lord	1
Falconroy,	1
the	1
famous	1
traveller,	1
a	1
true-blooded	1
aristocrat	1
fresh	1
from	1
England's	1
oak-groves.	1
Lord	1
Falconroy's	1
travels	1
began	1
before	1
his	1
ancient	1
feudal	1
title	1
was	1
resurrected,	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
Republic	1
in	1
his	1
youth,	1
and	1
fashion	1
murmurs	1
a	1
sly	1
reason	1
for	1
his	1
return.	1
Miss	1
Etta	1
Todd	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
our	1
deep-souled	1
New	1
Yorkers,	1
and	1
comes	1
into	1
an	1
income	1
of	1
nearly	1
twelve	1
hundred	1
million	1
dollars."	1
"Well,"	1
asked	1
Usher,	1
"does	1
that	1
interest	1
you?"	1
"Why,	1
words	1
rather	1
fail	1
me,"	1
answered	1
Father	1
Brown.	1
"I	1
cannot	1
think	1
at	1
this	1
moment	1
of	1
anything	1
in	1
this	1
world	1
that	1
would	1
interest	1
me	1
less.	1
And,	1
unless	1
the	1
just	1
anger	1
of	1
the	1
Republic	1
is	1
at	1
last	1
going	1
to	1
electrocute	1
journalists	1
for	1
writing	1
like	1
that,	1
I	1
don't	1
quite	1
see	1
why	1
it	1
should	1
interest	1
you	1
either."	1
"Ah!"	1
said	1
Mr	1
Usher	1
dryly,	1
and	1
handing	1
across	1
another	1
scrap	1
of	1
newspaper.	1
"Well,	1
does	1
that	1
interest	1
you?"	1
The	1
paragraph	1
was	1
headed	1
"Savage	1
Murder	1
of	1
a	1
Warder.	1
Convict	1
Escapes,"	1
and	1
ran:	1
"Just	1
before	1
dawn	1
this	1
morning	1
a	1
shout	1
for	1
help	1
was	1
heard	1
in	1
the	1
Convict	1
Settlement	1
at	1
Sequah	1
in	1
this	1
State.	1
The	1
authorities,	1
hurrying	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
the	1
cry,	1
found	1
the	1
corpse	1
of	1
the	1
warder	1
who	1
patrols	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
north	1
wall	1
of	1
the	1
prison,	1
the	1
steepest	1
and	1
most	1
difficult	1
exit,	1
for	1
which	1
one	1
man	1
has	1
always	1
been	1
found	1
sufficient.	1
The	1
unfortunate	1
officer	1
had,	1
however,	1
been	1
hurled	1
from	1
the	1
high	1
wall,	1
his	1
brains	1
beaten	1
out	1
as	1
with	1
a	1
club,	1
and	1
his	1
gun	1
was	1
missing.	1
Further	1
inquiries	1
showed	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
cells	1
was	1
empty;	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
occupied	1
by	1
a	1
rather	1
sullen	1
ruffian	1
giving	1
his	1
name	1
as	1
Oscar	1
Rian.	1
He	1
was	1
only	1
temporarily	1
detained	1
for	1
some	1
comparatively	1
trivial	1
assault;	1
but	1
he	1
gave	1
everyone	1
the	1
impression	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
black	1
past	1
and	1
a	1
dangerous	1
future.	1
Finally,	1
when	1
daylight	1
bad	1
fully	1
revealed	1
the	1
scene	1
of	1
murder,	1
it	1
was	1
found	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
written	1
on	1
the	1
wall	1
above	1
the	1
body	1
a	1
fragmentary	1
sentence,	1
apparently	1
with	1
a	1
finger	1
dipped	1
in	1
blood:	1
`This	1
was	1
self-defence	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
gun.	1
I	1
meant	1
no	1
harm	1
to	1
him	1
or	1
any	1
man	1
but	1
one.	1
I	1
am	1
keeping	1
the	1
bullet	1
for	1
Pilgrim's	1
Pond--O.R.'	1
A	1
man	1
must	1
have	1
used	1
most	1
fiendish	1
treachery	1
or	1
most	1
savage	1
and	1
amazing	1
bodily	1
daring	1
to	1
have	1
stormed	1
such	1
a	1
wall	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
an	1
armed	1
man."	1
"Well,	1
the	1
literary	1
style	1
is	1
somewhat	1
improved,"	1
admitted	1
the	1
priest	1
cheerfully,	1
"but	1
still	1
I	1
don't	1
see	1
what	1
I	1
can	1
do	1
for	1
you.	1
I	1
should	1
cut	1
a	1
poor	1
figure,	1
with	1
my	1
short	1
legs,	1
running	1
about	1
this	1
State	1
after	1
an	1
athletic	1
assassin	1
of	1
that	1
sort.	1
I	1
doubt	1
whether	1
anybody	1
could	1
find	1
him.	1
The	1
convict	1
settlement	1
at	1
Sequah	1
is	1
thirty	1
miles	1
from	1
here;	1
the	1
country	1
between	1
is	1
wild	1
and	1
tangled	1
enough,	1
and	1
the	1
country	1
beyond,	1
where	1
he	1
will	1
surely	1
have	1
the	1
sense	1
to	1
go,	1
is	1
a	1
perfect	1
no-man's	1
land	1
tumbling	1
away	1
to	1
the	1
prairies.	1
He	1
may	1
be	1
in	1
any	1
hole	1
or	1
up	1
any	1
tree."	1
"He	1
isn't	1
in	1
any	1
hole,"	1
said	1
the	1
governor;	1
"he	1
isn't	1
up	1
any	1
tree."	1
"Why,	1
how	1
do	1
you	1
know?"	1
asked	1
Father	1
Brown,	1
blinking.	1
"Would	1
you	1
like	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
him?"	1
inquired	1
Usher.	1
Father	1
Brown	1
opened	1
his	1
innocent	1
eyes	1
wide.	1
"He	1
is	1
here?"	1
he	1
exclaimed.	1
"Why,	1
how	1
did	1
your	1
men	1
get	1
hold	1
of	1
him?"	1
"I	1
got	1
hold	1
of	1
him	1
myself,"	1
drawled	1
the	1
American,	1
rising	1
and	1
lazily	1
stretching	1
his	1
lanky	1
legs	1
before	1
the	1
fire.	1
"I	1
got	1
hold	1
of	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
crooked	1
end	1
of	1
a	1
walking-stick.	1
Don't	1
look	1
so	1
surprised.	1
I	1
really	1
did.	1
You	1
know	1
I	1
sometimes	1
take	1
a	1
turn	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
lanes	1
outside	1
this	1
dismal	1
place;	1
well,	1
I	1
was	1
walking	1
early	1
this	1
evening	1
up	1
a	1
steep	1
lane	1
with	1
dark	1
hedges	1
and	1
grey-looking	1
ploughed	1
fields	1
on	1
both	1
sides;	1
and	1
a	1
young	1
moon	1
was	1
up	1
and	1
silvering	1
the	1
road.	1
By	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
it	1
I	1
saw	1
a	1
man	1
running	1
across	1
the	1
field	1
towards	1
the	1
road;	1
running	1
with	1
his	1
body	1
bent	1
and	1
at	1
a	1
good	1
mile-race	1
trot.	1
He	1
appeared	1
to	1
be	1
much	1
exhausted;	1
but	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
thick	1
black	1
hedge	1
he	1
went	1
through	1
it	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
made	1
of	1
spiders'	1
webs;	1
--or	1
rather	1
(for	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
strong	1
branches	1
breaking	1
and	1
snapping	1
like	1
bayonets)	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
himself	1
were	1
made	1
of	1
stone.	1
In	1
the	1
instant	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
appeared	1
up	1
against	1
the	1
moon,	1
crossing	1
the	1
road,	1
I	1
slung	1
my	1
hooked	1
cane	1
at	1
his	1
legs,	1
tripping	1
him	1
and	1
bringing	1
him	1
down.	1
Then	1
I	1
blew	1
my	1
whistle	1
long	1
and	1
loud,	1
and	1
our	1
fellows	1
came	1
running	1
up	1
to	1
secure	1
him."	1
"It	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
rather	1
awkward,"	1
remarked	1
Brown,	1
"if	1
you	1
had	1
found	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
popular	1
athlete	1
practising	1
a	1
mile	1
race."	1
"He	1
was	1
not,"	1
said	1
Usher	1
grimly.	1
"We	1
soon	1
found	1
out	1
who	1
he	1
was;	1
but	1
I	1
had	1
guessed	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
first	1
glint	1
of	1
the	1
moon	1
on	1
him."	1
"You	1
thought	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
runaway	1
convict,"	1
observed	1
the	1
priest	1
simply,	1
"because	1
you	1
had	1
read	1
in	1
the	1
newspaper	1
cutting	1
that	1
morning	1
that	1
a	1
convict	1
had	1
run	1
away."	1
"I	1
had	1
somewhat	1
better	1
grounds,"	1
replied	1
the	1
governor	1
coolly.	1
"I	1
pass	1
over	1
the	1
first	1
as	1
too	1
simple	1
to	1
be	1
emphasized--	1
I	1
mean	1
that	1
fashionable	1
athletes	1
do	1
not	1
run	1
across	1
ploughed	1
fields	1
or	1
scratch	1
their	1
eyes	1
out	1
in	1
bramble	1
hedges.	1
Nor	1
do	1
they	1
run	1
all	1
doubled	1
up	1
like	1
a	1
crouching	1
dog.	1
There	1
were	1
more	1
decisive	1
details	1
to	1
a	1
fairly	1
well-trained	1
eye.	1
The	1
man	1
was	1
clad	1
in	1
coarse	1
and	1
ragged	1
clothes,	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
something	1
more	1
than	1
merely	1
coarse	1
and	1
ragged.	1
They	1
were	1
so	1
ill-fitting	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
quite	1
grotesque;	1
even	1
as	1
he	1
appeared	1
in	1
black	1
outline	1
against	1
the	1
moonrise,	1
the	1
coat-collar	1
in	1
which	1
his	1
head	1
was	1
buried	1
made	1
him	1
look	1
like	1
a	1
hunchback,	1
and	1
the	1
long	1
loose	1
sleeves	1
looked	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
hands.	1
It	1
at	1
once	1
occurred	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
somehow	1
managed	1
to	1
change	1
his	1
convict	1
clothes	1
for	1
some	1
confederate's	1
clothes	1
which	1
did	1
not	1
fit	1
him.	1
Second,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
pretty	1
stiff	1
wind	1
against	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
running;	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
must	1
have	1
seen	1
the	1
streaky	1
look	1
of	1
blowing	1
hair,	1
if	1
the	1
hair	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
very	1
short.	1
Then	1
I	1
remembered	1
that	1
beyond	1
these	1
ploughed	1
fields	1
he	1
was	1
crossing	1
lay	1
Pilgrim's	1
Pond,	1
for	1
which	1
(you	1
will	1
remember)	1
the	1
convict	1
was	1
keeping	1
his	1
bullet;	1
and	1
I	1
sent	1
my	1
walking-stick	1
flying."	1
"A	1
brilliant	1
piece	1
of	1
rapid	1
deduction,"	1
said	1
Father	1
Brown;	1
"but	1
had	1
he	1
got	1
a	1
gun?"	1
As	1
Usher	1
stopped	1
abruptly	1
in	1
his	1
walk	1
the	1
priest	1
added	1
apologetically:	1
"I've	1
been	1
told	1
a	1
bullet	1
is	1
not	1
half	1
so	1
useful	1
without	1
it."	1
"He	1
had	1
no	1
gun,"	1
said	1
the	1
other	1
gravely;	1
"but	1
that	1
was	1
doubtless	1
due	1
to	1
some	1
very	1
natural	1
mischance	1
or	1
change	1
of	1
plans.	1
Probably	1
the	1
same	1
policy	1
that	1
made	1
him	1
change	1
the	1
clothes	1
made	1
him	1
drop	1
the	1
gun;	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
repent	1
the	1
coat	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
behind	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
his	1
victim."	1
"Well,	1
that	1
is	1
possible	1
enough,"	1
answered	1
the	1
priest.	1
"And	1
it's	1
hardly	1
worth	1
speculating	1
on,"	1
said	1
Usher,	1
turning	1
to	1
some	1
other	1
papers,	1
"for	1
we	1
know	1
it's	1
the	1
man	1
by	1
this	1
time."	1
His	1
clerical	1
friend	1
asked	1
faintly:	1
"But	1
how?"	1
And	1
Greywood	1
Usher	1
threw	1
down	1
the	1
newspapers	1
and	1
took	1
up	1
the	1
two	1
press-cuttings	1
again.	1
"Well,	1
since	1
you	1
are	1
so	1
obstinate,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"let's	1
begin	1
at	1
the	1
beginning.	1
You	1
will	1
notice	1
that	1
these	1
two	1
cuttings	1
have	1
only	1
one	1
thing	1
in	1
common,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
mention	1
of	1
Pilgrim's	1
Pond,	1
the	1
estate,	1
as	1
you	1
know,	1
of	1
the	1
millionaire	1
Ireton	1
Todd.	1
You	1
also	1
know	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
remarkable	1
character;	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
rose	1
on	1
stepping-stones--"	1
"Of	1
our	1
dead	1
selves	1
to	1
higher	1
things,"	1
assented	1
his	1
companion.	1
"Yes;	1
I	1
know	1
that.	1
Petroleum,	1
I	1
think."	1
"Anyhow,"	1
said	1
Usher,	1
"Last-Trick	1
Todd	1
counts	1
for	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
in	1
this	1
rum	1
affair."	1
He	1
stretched	1
himself	1
once	1
more	1
before	1
the	1
fire	1
and	1
continued	1
talking	1
in	1
his	1
expansive,	1
radiantly	1
explanatory	1
style.	1
"To	1
begin	1
with,	1
on	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
it,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
mystery	1
here	1
at	1
all.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
mysterious,	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
even	1
odd,	1
that	1
a	1
jailbird	1
should	1
take	1
his	1
gun	1
to	1
Pilgrim's	1
Pond.	1
Our	1
people	1
aren't	1
like	1
the	1
English,	1
who	1
will	1
forgive	1
a	1
man	1
for	1
being	1
rich	1
if	1
he	1
throws	1
away	1
money	1
on	1
hospitals	1
or	1
horses.	1
Last-Trick	1
Todd	1
has	1
made	1
himself	1
big	1
by	1
his	1
own	1
considerable	1
abilities;	1
and	1
there's	1
no	1
doubt	1
that	1
many	1
of	1
those	1
on	1
whom	1
he	1
has	1
shown	1
his	1
abilities	1
would	1
like	1
to	1
show	1
theirs	1
on	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
shot-gun.	1
Todd	1
might	1
easily	1
get	1
dropped	1
by	1
some	1
man	1
he'd	1
never	1
even	1
heard	1
of;	1
some	1
labourer	1
he'd	1
locked	1
out,	1
or	1
some	1
clerk	1
in	1
a	1
business	1
he'd	1
busted.	1
Last-Trick	1
is	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
mental	1
endowments	1
and	1
a	1
high	1
public	1
character;	1
but	1
in	1
this	1
country	1
the	1
relations	1
of	1
employers	1
and	1
employed	1
are	1
considerably	1
strained.	1
"That's	1
how	1
the	1
whole	1
thing	1
looks	1
supposing	1
this	1
Rian	1
made	1
for	1
Pilgrim's	1
Pond	1
to	1
kill	1
Todd.	1
So	1
it	1
looked	1
to	1
me,	1
till	1
another	1
little	1
discovery	1
woke	1
up	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
of	1
the	1
detective	1
in	1
me.	1
When	1
I	1
had	1
my	1
prisoner	1
safe,	1
I	1
picked	1
up	1
my	1
cane	1
again	1
and	1
strolled	1
down	1
the	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
turns	1
of	1
country	1
road	1
that	1
brought	1
me	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
side	1
entrances	1
of	1
Todd's	1
grounds,	1
the	1
one	1
nearest	1
to	1
the	1
pool	1
or	1
lake	1
after	1
which	1
the	1
place	1
is	1
named.	1
It	1
was	1
some	1
two	1
hours	1
ago,	1
about	1
seven	1
by	1
this	1
time;	1
the	1
moonlight	1
was	1
more	1
luminous,	1
and	1
I	1
could	1
see	1
the	1
long	1
white	1
streaks	1
of	1
it	1
lying	1
on	1
the	1
mysterious	1
mere	1
with	1
its	1
grey,	1
greasy,	1
half-liquid	1
shores	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
say	1
our	1
fathers	1
used	1
to	1
make	1
witches	1
walk	1
until	1
they	1
sank.	1
I'd	1
forgotten	1
the	1
exact	1
tale;	1
but	1
you	1
know	1
the	1
place	1
I	1
mean;	1
it	1
lies	1
north	1
of	1
Todd's	1
house	1
towards	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
and	1
has	1
two	1
queer	1
wrinkled	1
trees,	1
so	1
dismal	1
that	1
they	1
look	1
more	1
like	1
huge	1
fungoids	1
than	1
decent	1
foliage.	1
As	1
I	1
stood	1
peering	1
at	1
this	1
misty	1
pool,	1
I	1
fancied	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
faint	1
figure	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
moving	1
from	1
the	1
house	1
towards	1
it,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
too	1
dim	1
and	1
distant	1
for	1
one	1
to	1
be	1
certain	1
of	1
the	1
fact,	1
and	1
still	1
less	1
of	1
the	1
details.	1
Besides,	1
my	1
attention	1
was	1
very	1
sharply	1
arrested	1
by	1
something	1
much	1
closer.	1
I	1
crouched	1
behind	1
the	1
fence	1
which	1
ran	1
not	1
more	1
than	1
two	1
hundred	1
yards	1
from	1
one	1
wing	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
mansion,	1
and	1
which	1
was	1
fortunately	1
split	1
in	1
places,	1
as	1
if	1
specially	1
for	1
the	1
application	1
of	1
a	1
cautious	1
eye.	1
A	1
door	1
had	1
opened	1
in	1
the	1
dark	1
bulk	1
of	1
the	1
left	1
wing,	1
and	1
a	1
figure	1
appeared	1
black	1
against	1
the	1
illuminated	1
interior--a	1
muffled	1
figure	1
bending	1
forward,	1
evidently	1
peering	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
night.	1
It	1
closed	1
the	1
door	1
behind	1
it,	1
and	1
I	1
saw	1
it	1
was	1
carrying	1
a	1
lantern,	1
which	1
threw	1
a	1
patch	1
of	1
imperfect	1
light	1
on	1
the	1
dress	1
and	1
figure	1
of	1
the	1
wearer.	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
figure	1
of	1
a	1
woman,	1
wrapped	1
up	1
in	1
a	1
ragged	1
cloak	1
and	1
evidently	1
disguised	1
to	1
avoid	1
notice;	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
very	1
strange	1
both	1
about	1
the	1
rags	1
and	1
the	1
furtiveness	1
in	1
a	1
person	1
coming	1
out	1
of	1
those	1
rooms	1
lined	1
with	1
gold.	1
She	1
took	1
cautiously	1
the	1
curved	1
garden	1
path	1
which	1
brought	1
her	1
within	1
half	1
a	1
hundred	1
yards	1
of	1
me--,	1
then	1
she	1
stood	1
up	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
on	1
the	1
terrace	1
of	1
turf	1
that	1
looks	1
towards	1
the	1
slimy	1
lake,	1
and	1
holding	1
her	1
flaming	1
lantern	1
above	1
her	1
head	1
she	1
deliberately	1
swung	1
it	1
three	1
times	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
as	1
for	1
a	1
signal.	1
As	1
she	1
swung	1
it	1
the	1
second	1
time	1
a	1
flicker	1
of	1
its	1
light	1
fell	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
on	1
her	1
own	1
face,	1
a	1
face	1
that	1
I	1
knew.	1
She	1
was	1
unnaturally	1
pale,	1
and	1
her	1
head	1
was	1
bundled	1
in	1
her	1
borrowed	1
plebeian	1
shawl;	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
certain	1
it	1
was	1
Etta	1
Todd,	1
the	1
millionaire's	1
daughter.	1
"She	1
retraced	1
her	1
steps	1
in	1
equal	1
secrecy	1
and	1
the	1
door	1
closed	1
behind	1
her	1
again.	1
I	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
climb	1
the	1
fence	1
and	1
follow,	1
when	1
I	1
realized	1
that	1
the	1
detective	1
fever	1
that	1
had	1
lured	1
me	1
into	1
the	1
adventure	1
was	1
rather	1
undignified;	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
a	1
more	1
authoritative	1
capacity	1
I	1
already	1
held	1
all	1
the	1
cards	1
in	1
my	1
hand.	1
I	1
was	1
just	1
turning	1
away	1
when	1
a	1
new	1
noise	1
broke	1
on	1
the	1
night.	1
A	1
window	1
was	1
thrown	1
up	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
upper	1
floors,	1
but	1
just	1
round	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
it;	1
and	1
a	1
voice	1
of	1
terrible	1
distinctness	1
was	1
heard	1
shouting	1
across	1
the	1
dark	1
garden	1
to	1
know	1
where	1
Lord	1
Falconroy	1
was,	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
missing	1
from	1
every	1
room	1
in	1
the	1
house.	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
mistaking	1
that	1
voice.	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
it	1
on	1
many	1
a	1
political	1
platform	1
or	1
meeting	1
of	1
directors;	1
it	1
was	1
Ireton	1
Todd	1
himself.	1
Some	1
of	1
the	1
others	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
gone	1
to	1
the	1
lower	1
windows	1
or	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
steps,	1
and	1
were	1
calling	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
Falconroy	1
had	1
gone	1
for	1
a	1
stroll	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
Pilgrim's	1
Pond	1
an	1
hour	1
before,	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
traced	1
since.	1
Then	1
Todd	1
cried	1
`Mighty	1
Murder!'	1
and	1
shut	1
down	1
the	1
window	1
violently;	1
and	1
I	1
could	1
hear	1
him	1
plunging	1
down	1
the	1
stairs	1
inside.	1
Repossessing	1
myself	1
of	1
my	1
former	1
and	1
wiser	1
purpose,	1
I	1
whipped	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
general	1
search	1
that	1
must	1
follow;	1
and	1
returned	1
here	1
not	1
later	1
than	1
eight	1
o'clock.	1
"I	1
now	1
ask	1
you	1
to	1
recall	1
that	1
little	1
Society	1
paragraph	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
you	1
so	1
painfully	1
lacking	1
in	1
interest.	1
If	1
the	1
convict	1
was	1
not	1
keeping	1
the	1
shot	1
for	1
Todd,	1
as	1
he	1
evidently	1
wasn't,	1
it	1
is	1
most	1
likely	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
keeping	1
it	1
for	1
Lord	1
Falconroy;	1
and	1
it	1
looks	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
delivered	1
the	1
goods.	1
No	1
more	1
handy	1
place	1
to	1
shoot	1
a	1
man	1
than	1
in	1
the	1
curious	1
geological	1
surroundings	1
of	1
that	1
pool,	1
where	1
a	1
body	1
thrown	1
down	1
would	1
sink	1
through	1
thick	1
slime	1
to	1
a	1
depth	1
practically	1
unknown.	1
Let	1
us	1
suppose,	1
then,	1
that	1
our	1
friend	1
with	1
the	1
cropped	1
hair	1
came	1
to	1
kill	1
Falconroy	1
and	1
not	1
Todd.	1
But,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
pointed	1
out,	1
there	1
are	1
many	1
reasons	1
why	1
people	1
in	1
America	1
might	1
want	1
to	1
kill	1
Todd.	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
reason	1
why	1
anybody	1
in	1
America	1
should	1
want	1
to	1
kill	1
an	1
English	1
lord	1
newly	1
landed,	1
except	1
for	1
the	1
one	1
reason	1
mentioned	1
in	1
the	1
pink	1
paper--that	1
the	1
lord	1
is	1
paying	1
his	1
attentions	1
to	1
the	1
millionaire's	1
daughter.	1
Our	1
crop-haired	1
friend,	1
despite	1
his	1
ill-fitting	1
clothes,	1
must	1
be	1
an	1
aspiring	1
lover.	1
"I	1
know	1
the	1
notion	1
will	1
seem	1
to	1
you	1
jarring	1
and	1
even	1
comic;	1
but	1
that's	1
because	1
you	1
are	1
English.	1
It	1
sounds	1
to	1
you	1
like	1
saying	1
the	1
Archbishop	1
of	1
Canterbury's	1
daughter	1
will	1
be	1
married	1
in	1
St	1
George's,	1
Hanover	1
Square,	1
to	1
a	1
crossing-sweeper	1
on	1
ticket-of-leave.	1
You	1
don't	1
do	1
justice	1
to	1
the	1
climbing	1
and	1
aspiring	1
power	1
of	1
our	1
more	1
remarkable	1
citizens.	1
You	1
see	1
a	1
good-looking	1
grey-haired	1
man	1
in	1
evening-dress	1
with	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
authority	1
about	1
him,	1
you	1
know	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
pillar	1
of	1
the	1
State,	1
and	1
you	1
fancy	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
father.	1
You	1
are	1
in	1
error.	1
You	1
do	1
not	1
realize	1
that	1
a	1
comparatively	1
few	1
years	1
ago	1
he	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
a	1
tenement	1
or	1
(quite	1
likely)	1
in	1
a	1
jail.	1
You	1
don't	1
allow	1
for	1
our	1
national	1
buoyancy	1
and	1
uplift.	1
Many	1
of	1
our	1
most	1
influential	1
citizens	1
have	1
not	1
only	1
risen	1
recently,	1
but	1
risen	1
comparatively	1
late	1
in	1
life.	1
Todd's	1
daughter	1
was	1
fully	1
eighteen	1
when	1
her	1
father	1
first	1
made	1
his	1
pile;	1
so	1
there	1
isn't	1
really	1
anything	1
impossible	1
in	1
her	1
having	1
a	1
hanger-on	1
in	1
low	1
life;	1
or	1
even	1
in	1
her	1
hanging	1
on	1
to	1
him,	1
as	1
I	1
think	1
she	1
must	1
be	1
doing,	1
to	1
judge	1
by	1
the	1
lantern	1
business.	1
If	1
so,	1
the	1
hand	1
that	1
held	1
the	1
lantern	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
unconnected	1
with	1
the	1
hand	1
that	1
held	1
the	1
gun.	1
This	1
case,	1
sir,	1
will	1
make	1
a	1
noise."	1
"Well,"	1
said	1
the	1
priest	1
patiently,	1
"and	1
what	1
did	1
you	1
do	1
next?"	1
"I	1
reckon	1
you'll	1
be	1
shocked,"	1
replied	1
Greywood	1
Usher,	1
"as	1
I	1
know	1
you	1
don't	1
cotton	1
to	1
the	1
march	1
of	1
science	1
in	1
these	1
matters.	1
I	1
am	1
given	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
of	1
discretion	1
here,	1
and	1
perhaps	1
take	1
a	1
little	1
more	1
than	1
I'm	1
given;	1
and	1
I	1
thought	1
it	1
was	1
an	1
excellent	1
opportunity	1
to	1
test	1
that	1
Psychometric	1
Machine	1
I	1
told	1
you	1
about.	1
Now,	1
in	1
my	1
opinion,	1
that	1
machine	1
can't	1
lie."	1
"No	1
machine	1
can	1
lie,"	1
said	1
Father	1
Brown;	1
"nor	1
can	1
it	1
tell	1
the	1
truth."	1
"It	1
did	1
in	1
this	1
case,	1
as	1
I'll	1
show	1
you,"	1
went	1
on	1
Usher	1
positively.	1
"I	1
sat	1
the	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
ill-fitting	1
clothes	1
in	1
a	1
comfortable	1
chair,	1
and	1
simply	1
wrote	1
words	1
on	1
a	1
blackboard;	1
and	1
the	1
machine	1
simply	1
recorded	1
the	1
variations	1
of	1
his	1
pulse;	1
and	1
I	1
simply	1
observed	1
his	1
manner.	1
The	1
trick	1
is	1
to	1
introduce	1
some	1
word	1
connected	1
with	1
the	1
supposed	1
crime	1
in	1
a	1
list	1
of	1
words	1
connected	1
with	1
something	1
quite	1
different,	1
yet	1
a	1
list	1
in	1
which	1
it	1
occurs	1
quite	1
naturally.	1
Thus	1
I	1
wrote	1
`heron'	1
and	1
`eagle'	1
and	1
`owl',	1
and	1
when	1
I	1
wrote	1
`falcon'	1
he	1
was	1
tremendously	1
agitated;	1
and	1
when	1
I	1
began	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
`r'	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
word,	1
that	1
machine	1
just	1
bounded.	1
Who	1
else	1
in	1
this	1
republic	1
has	1
any	1
reason	1
to	1
jump	1
at	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
a	1
newly-arrived	1
Englishman	1
like	1
Falconroy	1
except	1
the	1
man	1
who's	1
shot	1
him?	1
Isn't	1
that	1
better	1
evidence	1
than	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
gabble	1
from	1
witnesses--if	1
the	1
evidence	1
of	1
a	1
reliable	1
machine?"	1
"You	1
always	1
forget,"	1
observed	1
his	1
companion,	1
"that	1
the	1
reliable	1
machine	1
always	1
has	1
to	1
be	1
worked	1
by	1
an	1
unreliable	1
machine."	1
"Why,	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
mean?"	1
asked	1
the	1
detective.	1
"I	1
mean	1
Man,"	1
said	1
Father	1
Brown,	1
"the	1
most	1
unreliable	1
machine	1
I	1
know	1
of.	1
I	1
don't	1
want	1
to	1
be	1
rude;	1
and	1
I	1
don't	1
think	1
you	1
will	1
consider	1
Man	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
offensive	1
or	1
inaccurate	1
description	1
of	1
yourself.	1
You	1
say	1
you	1
observed	1
his	1
manner;	1
but	1
how	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
you	1
observed	1
it	1
right?	1
You	1
say	1
the	1
words	1
have	1
to	1
come	1
in	1
a	1
natural	1
way;	1
but	1
how	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
you	1
did	1
it	1
naturally?	1
How	1
do	1
you	1
know,	1
if	1
you	1
come	1
to	1
that,	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
observe	1
your	1
manner?	1
Who	1
is	1
to	1
prove	1
that	1
you	1
were	1
not	1
tremendously	1
agitated?	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
machine	1
tied	1
on	1
to	1
your	1
pulse."	1
"I	1
tell	1
you,"	1
cried	1
the	1
American	1
in	1
the	1
utmost	1
excitement,	1
"I	1
was	1
as	1
cool	1
as	1
a	1
cucumber."	1
"Criminals	1
also	1
can	1
be	1
as	1
cool	1
as	1
cucumbers,"	1
said	1
Brown	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
"And	1
almost	1
as	1
cool	1
as	1
you."	1
"Well,	1
this	1
one	1
wasn't,"	1
said	1
Usher,	1
throwing	1
the	1
papers	1
about.	1
"Oh,	1
you	1
make	1
me	1
tired!"	1
"I'm	1
sorry,"	1
said	1
the	1
other.	1
"I	1
only	1
point	1
out	1
what	1
seems	1
a	1
reasonable	1
possibility.	1
If	1
you	1
could	1
tell	1
by	1
his	1
manner	1
when	1
the	1
word	1
that	1
might	1
hang	1
him	1
had	1
come,	1
why	1
shouldn't	1
he	1
tell	1
from	1
your	1
manner	1
that	1
the	1
word	1
that	1
might	1
hang	1
him	1
was	1
coming?	1
I	1
should	1
ask	1
for	1
more	1
than	1
words	1
myself	1
before	1
I	1
hanged	1
anybody."	1
Usher	1
smote	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
rose	1
in	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
angry	1
triumph.	1
"And	1
that,"	1
he	1
cried,	1
"is	1
just	1
what	1
I'm	1
going	1
to	1
give	1
you.	1
I	1
tried	1
the	1
machine	1
first	1
just	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
test	1
the	1
thing	1
in	1
other	1
ways	1
afterwards	1
and	1
the	1
machine,	1
sir,	1
is	1
right."	1
He	1
paused	1
a	1
moment	1
and	1
resumed	1
with	1
less	1
excitement.	1
"I	1
rather	1
want	1
to	1
insist,	1
if	1
it	1
comes	1
to	1
that,	1
that	1
so	1
far	1
I	1
had	1
very	1
little	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
except	1
the	1
scientific	1
experiment.	1
There	1
was	1
really	1
nothing	1
against	1
the	1
man	1
at	1
all.	1
His	1
clothes	1
were	1
ill-fitting,	1
as	1
I've	1
said,	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
rather	1
better,	1
if	1
anything,	1
than	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
submerged	1
class	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
evidently	1
belonged.	1
Moreover,	1
under	1
all	1
the	1
stains	1
of	1
his	1
plunging	1
through	1
ploughed	1
fields	1
or	1
bursting	1
through	1
dusty	1
hedges,	1
the	1
man	1
was	1
comparatively	1
clean.	1
This	1
might	1
mean,	1
of	1
course,	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
only	1
just	1
broken	1
prison;	1
but	1
it	1
reminded	1
me	1
more	1
of	1
the	1
desperate	1
decency	1
of	1
the	1
comparatively	1
respectable	1
poor.	1
His	1
demeanour	1
was,	1
I	1
am	1
bound	1
to	1
confess,	1
quite	1
in	1
accordance	1
with	1
theirs.	1
He	1
was	1
silent	1
and	1
dignified	1
as	1
they	1
are;	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
big,	1
but	1
buried,	1
grievance,	1
as	1
they	1
do.	1
He	1
professed	1
total	1
ignorance	1
of	1
the	1
crime	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
question;	1
and	1
showed	1
nothing	1
but	1
a	1
sullen	1
impatience	1
for	1
something	1
sensible	1
that	1
might	1
come	1
to	1
take	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
meaningless	1
scrape.	1
He	1
asked	1
me	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
if	1
he	1
could	1
telephone	1
for	1
a	1
lawyer	1
who	1
had	1
helped	1
him	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
ago	1
in	1
a	1
trade	1
dispute,	1
and	1
in	1
every	1
sense	1
acted	1
as	1
you	1
would	1
expect	1
an	1
innocent	1
man	1
to	1
act.	1
There	1
was	1
nothing	1
against	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
except	1
that	1
little	1
finger	1
on	1
the	1
dial	1
that	1
pointed	1
to	1
the	1
change	1
of	1
his	1
pulse.	1
"Then,	1
sir,	1
the	1
machine	1
was	1
on	1
its	1
trial;	1
and	1
the	1
machine	1
was	1
right.	1
By	1
the	1
time	1
I	1
came	1
with	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
private	1
room	1
into	1
the	1
vestibule	1
where	1
all	1
sorts	1
of	1
other	1
people	1
were	1
awaiting	1
examination,	1
I	1
think	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
more	1
or	1
less	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
to	1
clear	1
things	1
up	1
by	1
something	1
like	1
a	1
confession.	1
He	1
turned	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
say	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice:	1
`Oh,	1
I	1
can't	1
stick	1
this	1
any	1
more.	1
If	1
you	1
must	1
know	1
all	1
about	1
me--'	1
"At	1
the	1
same	1
instant	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
poor	1
women	1
sitting	1
on	1
the	1
long	1
bench	1
stood	1
up,	1
screaming	1
aloud	1
and	1
pointing	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
her	1
finger.	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
in	1
my	1
life	1
heard	1
anything	1
more	1
demoniacally	1
distinct.	1
Her	1
lean	1
finger	1
seemed	1
to	1
pick	1
him	1
out	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
pea-shooter.	1
Though	1
the	1
word	1
was	1
a	1
mere	1
howl,	1
every	1
syllable	1
was	1
as	1
clear	1
as	1
a	1
separate	1
stroke	1
on	1
the	1
clock.	1
"`Drugger	1
Davis!'	1
she	1
shouted.	1
`They've	1
got	1
Drugger	1
Davis!'	1
"Among	1
the	1
wretched	1
women,	1
mostly	1
thieves	1
and	1
streetwalkers,	1
twenty	1
faces	1
were	1
turned,	1
gaping	1
with	1
glee	1
and	1
hate.	1
If	1
I	1
had	1
never	1
heard	1
the	1
words,	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
known	1
by	1
the	1
very	1
shock	1
upon	1
his	1
features	1
that	1
the	1
so-called	1
Oscar	1
Rian	1
had	1
heard	1
his	1
real	1
name.	1
But	1
I'm	1
not	1
quite	1
so	1
ignorant,	1
you	1
may	1
be	1
surprised	1
to	1
hear.	1
Drugger	1
Davis	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
terrible	1
and	1
depraved	1
criminals	1
that	1
ever	1
baffled	1
our	1
police.	1
It	1
is	1
certain	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
murder	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
long	1
before	1
his	1
last	1
exploit	1
with	1
the	1
warder.	1
But	1
he	1
was	1
never	1
entirely	1
fixed	1
for	1
it,	1
curiously	1
enough	1
because	1
he	1
did	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
manner	1
as	1
those	1
milder--or	1
meaner--crimes	1
for	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
fixed	1
pretty	1
often.	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
handsome,	1
well-bred-looking	1
brute,	1
as	1
he	1
still	1
is,	1
to	1
some	1
extent;	1
and	1
he	1
used	1
mostly	1
to	1
go	1
about	1
with	1
barmaids	1
or	1
shop-girls	1
and	1
do	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
money.	1
Very	1
often,	1
though,	1
he	1
went	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
farther;	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
found	1
drugged	1
with	1
cigarettes	1
or	1
chocolates	1
and	1
their	1
whole	1
property	1
missing.	1
Then	1
came	1
one	1
case	1
where	1
the	1
girl	1
was	1
found	1
dead;	1
but	1
deliberation	1
could	1
not	1
quite	1
be	1
proved,	1
and,	1
what	1
was	1
more	1
practical	1
still,	1
the	1
criminal	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
found.	1
I	1
heard	1
a	1
rumour	1
of	1
his	1
having	1
reappeared	1
somewhere	1
in	1
the	1
opposite	1
character	1
this	1
time,	1
lending	1
money	1
instead	1
of	1
borrowing	1
it;	1
but	1
still	1
to	1
such	1
poor	1
widows	1
as	1
he	1
might	1
personally	1
fascinate,	1
but	1
still	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
bad	1
result	1
for	1
them.	1
Well,	1
there	1
is	1
your	1
innocent	1
man,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
his	1
innocent	1
record.	1
Even,	1
since	1
then,	1
four	1
criminals	1
and	1
three	1
warders	1
have	1
identified	1
him	1
and	1
confirmed	1
the	1
story.	1
Now	1
what	1
have	1
you	1
got	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
my	1
poor	1
little	1
machine	1
after	1
that?	1
Hasn't	1
the	1
machine	1
done	1
for	1
him?	1
Or	1
do	1
you	1
prefer	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
the	1
woman	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
for	1
him?"	1
"As	1
to	1
what	1
you've	1
done	1
for	1
him,"	1
replied	1
Father	1
Brown,	1
rising	1
and	1
shaking	1
himself	1
in	1
a	1
floppy	1
way,	1
"you've	1
saved	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
electrical	1
chair.	1
I	1
don't	1
think	1
they	1
can	1
kill	1
Drugger	1
Davis	1
on	1
that	1
old	1
vague	1
story	1
of	1
the	1
poison;	1
and	1
as	1
for	1
the	1
convict	1
who	1
killed	1
the	1
warder,	1
I	1
suppose	1
it's	1
obvious	1
that	1
you	1
haven't	1
got	1
him.	1
Mr	1
Davis	1
is	1
innocent	1
of	1
that	1
crime,	1
at	1
any	1
rate."	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
mean?"	1
demanded	1
the	1
other.	1
"Why	1
should	1
he	1
be	1
innocent	1
of	1
that	1
crime?"	1
"Why,	1
bless	1
us	1
all!"	1
cried	1
the	1
small	1
man	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
rare	1
moments	1
of	1
animation,	1
"why,	1
because	1
he's	1
guilty	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
crimes!	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
what	1
you	1
people	1
are	1
made	1
of.	1
You	1
seem	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
all	1
sins	1
are	1
kept	1
together	1
in	1
a	1
bag.	1
You	1
talk	1
as	1
if	1
a	1
miser	1
on	1
Monday	1
were	1
always	1
a	1
spendthrift	1
on	1
Tuesday.	1
You	1
tell	1
me	1
this	1
man	1
you	1
have	1
here	1
spent	1
weeks	1
and	1
months	1
wheedling	1
needy	1
women	1
out	1
of	1
small	1
sums	1
of	1
money;	1
that	1
he	1
used	1
a	1
drug	1
at	1
the	1
best,	1
and	1
a	1
poison	1
at	1
the	1
worst;	1
that	1
he	1
turned	1
up	1
afterwards	1
as	1
the	1
lowest	1
kind	1
of	1
moneylender,	1
and	1
cheated	1
most	1
poor	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
patient	1
and	1
pacific	1
style.	1
Let	1
it	1
be	1
granted--let	1
us	1
admit,	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
argument,	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
all	1
this.	1
If	1
that	1
is	1
so,	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
you	1
what	1
he	1
didn't	1
do.	1
He	1
didn't	1
storm	1
a	1
spiked	1
wall	1
against	1
a	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
loaded	1
gun.	1
He	1
didn't	1
write	1
on	1
the	1
wall	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
hand,	1
to	1
say	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
it.	1
He	1
didn't	1
stop	1
to	1
state	1
that	1
his	1
justification	1
was	1
self-defence.	1
He	1
didn't	1
explain	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
quarrel	1
with	1
the	1
poor	1
warder.	1
He	1
didn't	1
name	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
rich	1
man	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
with	1
the	1
gun.	1
He	1
didn't	1
write	1
his	1
own,	1
initials	1
in	1
a	1
man's	1
blood.	1
Saints	1
alive!	1
Can't	1
you	1
see	1
the	1
whole	1
character	1
is	1
different,	1
in	1
good	1
and	1
evil?	1
Why,	1
you	1
don't	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
like	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
bit.	1
One	1
would	1
think	1
you'd	1
never	1
had	1
any	1
vices	1
of	1
your	1
own."	1
The	1
amazed	1
American	1
had	1
already	1
parted	1
his	1
lips	1
in	1
protest	1
when	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
his	1
private	1
and	1
official	1
room	1
was	1
hammered	1
and	1
rattled	1
in	1
an	1
unceremonious	1
way	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
totally	1
unaccustomed.	1
The	1
door	1
flew	1
open.	1
The	1
moment	1
before	1
Greywood	1
Usher	1
had	1
been	1
coming	1
to	1
the	1
conclusion	1
that	1
Father	1
Brown	1
might	1
possibly	1
be	1
mad.	1
The	1
moment	1
after	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
think	1
he	1
was	1
mad	1
himself.	1
There	1
burst	1
and	1
fell	1
into	1
his	1
private	1
room	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
filthiest	1
rags,	1
with	1
a	1
greasy	1
squash	1
hat	1
still	1
askew	1
on	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
a	1
shabby	1
green	1
shade	1
shoved	1
up	1
from	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
eyes,	1
both	1
of	1
which	1
were	1
glaring	1
like	1
a	1
tiger's.	1
The	1
rest	1
of	1
his	1
face	1
was	1
almost	1
undiscoverable,	1
being	1
masked	1
with	1
a	1
matted	1
beard	1
and	1
whiskers	1
through	1
which	1
the	1
nose	1
could	1
barely	1
thrust	1
itself,	1
and	1
further	1
buried	1
in	1
a	1
squalid	1
red	1
scarf	1
or	1
handkerchief.	1
Mr	1
Usher	1
prided	1
himself	1
on	1
having	1
seen	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
roughest	1
specimens	1
in	1
the	1
State,	1
but	1
he	1
thought	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
such	1
a	1
baboon	1
dressed	1
as	1
a	1
scarecrow	1
as	1
this.	1
But,	1
above	1
all,	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
placid	1
scientific	1
existence	1
heard	1
a	1
man	1
like	1
that	1
speak	1
to	1
him	1
first.	1
"See	1
here,	1
old	1
man	1
Usher,"	1
shouted	1
the	1
being	1
in	1
the	1
red	1
handkerchief,	1
"I'm	1
getting	1
tired.	1
Don't	1
you	1
try	1
any	1
of	1
your	1
hide-and-seek	1
on	1
me;	1
I	1
don't	1
get	1
fooled	1
any.	1
Leave	1
go	1
of	1
my	1
guests,	1
and	1
I'll	1
let	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
fancy	1
clockwork.	1
Keep	1
him	1
here	1
for	1
a	1
split	1
instant	1
and	1
you'll	1
feel	1
pretty	1
mean.	1
I	1
reckon	1
I'm	1
not	1
a	1
man	1
with	1
no	1
pull."	1
The	1
eminent	1
Usher	1
was	1
regarding	1
the	1
bellowing	1
monster	1
with	1
an	1
amazement	1
which	1
had	1
dried	1
up	1
all	1
other	1
sentiments.	1
The	1
mere	1
shock	1
to	1
his	1
eyes	1
had	1
rendered	1
his	1
ears,	1
almost	1
useless.	1
At	1
last	1
he	1
rang	1
a	1
bell	1
with	1
a	1
hand	1
of	1
violence.	1
While	1
the	1
bell	1
was	1
still	1
strong	1
and	1
pealing,	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
Father	1
Brown	1
fell	1
soft	1
but	1
distinct.	1
"I	1
have	1
a	1
suggestion	1
to	1
make,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"but	1
it	1
seems	1
a	1
little	1
confusing.	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
this	1
gentleman--but--	1
but	1
I	1
think	1
I	1
know	1
him.	1
Now,	1
you	1
know	1
him--you	1
know	1
him	1
quite	1
well--	1
but	1
you	1
don't	1
know	1
him--naturally.	1
Sounds	1
paradoxical,	1
I	1
know."	1
"I	1
reckon	1
the	1
Cosmos	1
is	1
cracked,"	1
said	1
Usher,	1
and	1
fell	1
asprawl	1
in	1
his	1
round	1
office	1
chair.	1
"Now,	1
see	1
here,"	1
vociferated	1
the	1
stranger,	1
striking	1
the	1
table,	1
but	1
speaking	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
that	1
was	1
all	1
the	1
more	1
mysterious	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
comparatively	1
mild	1
and	1
rational	1
though	1
still	1
resounding.	1
"I	1
won't	1
let	1
you	1
in.	1
I	1
want--"	1
"Who	1
in	1
hell	1
are	1
you?"	1
yelled	1
Usher,	1
suddenly	1
sitting	1
up	1
straight.	1
"I	1
think	1
the	1
gentleman's	1
name	1
is	1
Todd,"	1
said	1
the	1
priest.	1
Then	1
he	1
picked	1
up	1
the	1
pink	1
slip	1
of	1
newspaper.	1
"I	1
fear	1
you	1
don't	1
read	1
the	1
Society	1
papers	1
properly,"	1
he	1
said,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
read	1
out	1
in	1
a	1
monotonous	1
voice,	1
"`Or	1
locked	1
in	1
the	1
jewelled	1
bosoms	1
of	1
our	1
city's	1
gayest	1
leaders;	1
but	1
there	1
is	1
talk	1
of	1
a	1
pretty	1
parody	1
of	1
the	1
manners	1
and	1
customs	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
end	1
of	1
Society's	1
scale.'	1
There's	1
been	1
a	1
big	1
Slum	1
Dinner	1
up	1
at	1
Pilgrim's	1
Pond	1
tonight;	1
and	1
a	1
man,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
guests,	1
disappeared.	1
Mr	1
Ireton	1
Todd	1
is	1
a	1
good	1
host,	1
and	1
has	1
tracked	1
him	1
here,	1
without	1
even	1
waiting	1
to	1
take	1
off	1
his	1
fancy-dress."	1
"What	1
man	1
do	1
you	1
mean?"	1
"I	1
mean	1
the	1
man	1
with	1
comically	1
ill-fitting	1
clothes	1
you	1
saw	1
running	1
across	1
the	1
ploughed	1
field.	1
Hadn't	1
you	1
better	1
go	1
and	1
investigate	1
him?	1
He	1
will	1
be	1
rather	1
impatient	1
to	1
get	1
back	1
to	1
his	1
champagne,	1
from	1
which	1
he	1
ran	1
away	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
hurry,	1
when	1
the	1
convict	1
with	1
the	1
gun	1
hove	1
in	1
sight."	1
"Do	1
you	1
seriously	1
mean--"	1
began	1
the	1
official.	1
"Why,	1
look	1
here,	1
Mr	1
Usher,"	1
said	1
Father	1
Brown	1
quietly,	1
"you	1
said	1
the	1
machine	1
couldn't	1
make	1
a	1
mistake;	1
and	1
in	1
one	1
sense	1
it	1
didn't.	1
But	1
the	1
other	1
machine	1
did;	1
the	1
machine	1
that	1
worked	1
it.	1
You	1
assumed	1
that	1
the	1
man	1
in	1
rags	1
jumped	1
at	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Lord	1
Falconroy,	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
Lord	1
Falconroy's	1
murderer.	1
He	1
jumped	1
at	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Lord	1
Falconroy	1
because	1
he	1
is	1
Lord	1
Falconroy."	1
"Then	1
why	1
the	1
blazes	1
didn't	1
he	1
say	1
so?"	1
demanded	1
the	1
staring	1
Usher.	1
"He	1
felt	1
his	1
plight	1
and	1
recent	1
panic	1
were	1
hardly	1
patrician,"	1
replied	1
the	1
priest,	1
"so	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
name	1
back	1
at	1
first.	1
But	1
he	1
was	1
just	1
going	1
to	1
tell	1
it	1
you,	1
when"--and	1
Father	1
Brown	1
looked	1
down	1
at	1
his	1
boots--"when	1
a	1
woman	1
found	1
another	1
name	1
for	1
him."	1
"But	1
you	1
can't	1
be	1
so	1
mad	1
as	1
to	1
say,"	1
said	1
Greywood	1
Usher,	1
very	1
white,	1
"that	1
Lord	1
Falconroy	1
was	1
Drugger	1
Davis."	1
The	1
priest	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
very	1
earnestly,	1
but	1
with	1
a	1
baffling	1
and	1
undecipherable	1
face.	1
"I	1
am	1
not	1
saying	1
anything	1
about	1
it,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"I	1
leave	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
to	1
you.	1
Your	1
pink	1
paper	1
says	1
that	1
the	1
title	1
was	1
recently	1
revived	1
for	1
him;	1
but	1
those	1
papers	1
are	1
very	1
unreliable.	1
It	1
says	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
States	1
in	1
youth;	1
but	1
the	1
whole	1
story	1
seems	1
very	1
strange.	1
Davis	1
and	1
Falconroy	1
are	1
both	1
pretty	1
considerable	1
cowards,	1
but	1
so	1
are	1
lots	1
of	1
other	1
men.	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
hang	1
a	1
dog	1
on	1
my	1
own	1
opinion	1
about	1
this.	1
But	1
I	1
think,"	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
softly	1
and	1
reflectively,	1
"I	1
think	1
you	1
Americans	1
are	1
too	1
modest.	1
I	1
think	1
you	1
idealize	1
the	1
English	1
aristocracy--even	1
in	1
assuming	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
aristocratic.	1
You	1
see	1
a	1
good-looking	1
Englishman	1
in	1
evening-dress;	1
you	1
know	1
he's	1
in	1
the	1
House	1
of	1
Lords;	1
and	1
you	1
fancy	1
he	1
has	1
a	1
father.	1
You	1
don't	1
allow	1
for	1
our	1
national	1
buoyancy	1
and	1
uplift.	1
Many	1
of	1
our	1
most	1
influential	1
noblemen	1
have	1
not	1
only	1
risen	1
recently,	1
but--"	1
"Oh,	1
stop	1
it!"	1
cried	1
Greywood	1
Usher,	1
wringing	1
one	1
lean	1
hand	1
in	1
impatience	1
against	1
a	1
shade	1
of	1
irony	1
in	1
the	1
other's	1
face.	1
"Don't	1
stay	1
talking	1
to	1
this	1
lunatic!"	1
cried	1
Todd	1
brutally.	1
"Take	1
me	1
to	1
my	1
friend."	1
Next	1
morning	1
Father	1
Brown	1
appeared	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
demure	1
expression,	1
carrying	1
yet	1
another	1
piece	1
of	1
pink	1
newspaper.	1
"I'm	1
afraid	1
you	1
neglect	1
the	1
fashionable	1
press	1
rather,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"but	1
this	1
cutting	1
may	1
interest	1
you."	1
Usher	1
read	1
the	1
headlines,	1
"Last-Trick's	1
Strayed	1
Revellers:	1
Mirthful	1
Incident	1
near	1
Pilgrim's	1
Pond."	1
The	1
paragraph	1
went	1
on:	1
"A	1
laughable	1
occurrence	1
took	1
place	1
outside	1
Wilkinson's	1
Motor	1
Garage	1
last	1
night.	1
A	1
policeman	1
on	1
duty	1
had	1
his	1
attention	1
drawn	1
by	1
larrikins	1
to	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
prison	1
dress	1
who	1
was	1
stepping	1
with	1
considerable	1
coolness	1
into	1
the	1
steering-seat	1
of	1
a	1
pretty	1
high-toned	1
Panhard;	1
he	1
was	1
accompanied	1
by	1
a	1
girl	1
wrapped	1
in	1
a	1
ragged	1
shawl.	1
On	1
the	1
police	1
interfering,	1
the	1
young	1
woman	1
threw	1
back	1
the	1
shawl,	1
and	1
all	1
recognized	1
Millionaire	1
Todd's	1
daughter,	1
who	1
had	1
just	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
Slum	1
Freak	1
Dinner	1
at	1
the	1
Pond,	1
where	1
all	1
the	1
choicest	1
guests	1
were	1
in	1
a	1
similar	1
deshabille.	1
She	1
and	1
the	1
gentleman	1
who	1
had	1
donned	1
prison	1
uniform	1
were	1
going	1
for	1
the	1
customary	1
joy-ride."	1
Under	1
the	1
pink	1
slip	1
Mr	1
Usher	1
found	1
a	1
strip	1
of	1
a	1
later	1
paper,	1
headed,	1
"Astounding	1
Escape	1
of	1
Millionaire's	1
Daughter	1
with	1
Convict.	1
She	1
had	1
Arranged	1
Freak	1
Dinner.	1
Now	1
Safe	1
in--"	1
Mr	1
Greenwood	1
Usher	1
lifted	1
his	1
eyes,	1
but	1
Father	1
Brown	1
was	1
gone.	1
VI.	1
The	1
Head	1
of	1
Caesar	1
THERE	1
is	1
somewhere	1
in	1
Brompton	1
or	1
Kensington	1
an	1
interminable	1
avenue	1
of	1
tall	1
houses,	1
rich	1
but	1
largely	1
empty,	1
that	1
looks	1
like	1
a	1
terrace	1
of	1
tombs.	1
The	1
very	1
steps	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
dark	1
front	1
doors	1
seem	1
as	1
steep	1
as	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
pyramids;	1
one	1
would	1
hesitate	1
to	1
knock	1
at	1
the	1
door,	1
lest	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
opened	1
by	1
a	1
mummy.	1
But	1
a	1
yet	1
more	1
depressing	1
feature	1
in	1
the	1
grey	1
facade	1
is	1
its	1
telescopic	1
length	1
and	1
changeless	1
continuity.	1
The	1
pilgrim	1
walking	1
down	1
it	1
begins	1
to	1
think	1
he	1
will	1
never	1
come	1
to	1
a	1
break	1
or	1
a	1
corner;	1
but	1
there	1
is	1
one	1
exception--a	1
very	1
small	1
one,	1
but	1
hailed	1
by	1
the	1
pilgrim	1
almost	1
with	1
a	1
shout.	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
mews	1
between	1
two	1
of	1
the	1
tall	1
mansions,	1
a	1
mere	1
slit	1
like	1
the	1
crack	1
of	1
a	1
door	1
by	1
comparison	1
with	1
the	1
street,	1
but	1
just	1
large	1
enough	1
to	1
permit	1
a	1
pigmy	1
ale-house	1
or	1
eating-house,	1
still	1
allowed	1
by	1
the	1
rich	1
to	1
their	1
stable-servants,	1
to	1
stand	1
in	1
the	1
angle.	1
There	1
is	1
something	1
cheery	1
in	1
its	1
very	1
dinginess,	1
and	1
something	1
free	1
and	1
elfin	1
in	1
its	1
very	1
insignificance.	1
At	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
those	1
grey	1
stone	1
giants	1
it	1
looks	1
like	1
a	1
lighted	1
house	1
of	1
dwarfs.	1
Anyone	1
passing	1
the	1
place	1
during	1
a	1
certain	1
autumn	1
evening,	1
itself	1
almost	1
fairylike,	1
might	1
have	1
seen	1
a	1
hand	1
pull	1
aside	1
the	1
red	1
half-blind	1
which	1
(along	1
with	1
some	1
large	1
white	1
lettering)	1
half	1
hid	1
the	1
interior	1
from	1
the	1
street,	1
and	1
a	1
face	1
peer	1
out	1
not	1
unlike	1
a	1
rather	1
innocent	1
goblin's.	1
It	1
was,	1
in	1
fact,	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
one	1
with	1
the	1
harmless	1
human	1
name	1
of	1
Brown,	1
formerly	1
priest	1
of	1
Cobhole	1
in	1
Essex,	1
and	1
now	1
working	1
in	1
London.	1
His	1
friend,	1
Flambeau,	1
a	1
semi-official	1
investigator,	1
was	1
sitting	1
opposite	1
him,	1
making	1
his	1
last	1
notes	1
of	1
a	1
case	1
he	1
had	1
cleared	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
neighbourhood.	1
They	1
were	1
sitting	1
at	1
a	1
small	1
table,	1
close	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
window,	1
when	1
the	1
priest	1
pulled	1
the	1
curtain	1
back	1
and	1
looked	1
out.	1
He	1
waited	1
till	1
a	1
stranger	1
in	1
the	1
street	1
had	1
passed	1
the	1
window,	1
to	1
let	1
the	1
curtain	1
fall	1
into	1
its	1
place	1
again.	1
Then	1
his	1
round	1
eyes	1
rolled	1
to	1
the	1
large	1
white	1
lettering	1
on	1
the	1
window	1
above	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
then	1
strayed	1
to	1
the	1
next	1
table,	1
at	1
which	1
sat	1
only	1
a	1
navvy	1
with	1
beer	1
and	1
cheese,	1
and	1
a	1
young	1
girl	1
with	1
red	1
hair	1
and	1
a	1
glass	1
of	1
milk.	1
Then	1
(seeing	1
his	1
friend	1
put	1
away	1
the	1
pocket-book),	1
he	1
said	1
softly:	1
"If	1
you've	1
got	1
ten	1
minutes,	1
I	1
wish	1
you'd	1
follow	1
that	1
man	1
with	1
the	1
false	1
nose."	1
Flambeau	1
looked	1
up	1
in	1
surprise;	1
but	1
the	1
girl	1
with	1
the	1
red	1
hair	1
also	1
looked	1
up,	1
and	1
with	1
something	1
that	1
was	1
stronger	1
than	1
astonishment.	1
She	1
was	1
simply	1
and	1
even	1
loosely	1
dressed	1
in	1
light	1
brown	1
sacking	1
stuff;	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
lady,	1
and	1
even,	1
on	1
a	1
second	1
glance,	1
a	1
rather	1
needlessly	1
haughty	1
one.	1
"The	1
man	1
with	1
the	1
false	1
nose!"	1
repeated	1
Flambeau.	1
"Who's	1
he?"	1
"I	1
haven't	1
a	1
notion,"	1
answered	1
Father	1
Brown.	1
"I	1
want	1
you	1
to	1
find	1
out;	1
I	1
ask	1
it	1
as	1
a	1
favour.	1
He	1
went	1
down	1
there"--and	1
he	1
jerked	1
his	1
thumb	1
over	1
his	1
shoulder	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
undistinguished	1
gestures--	1
"and	1
can't	1
have	1
passed	1
three	1
lamp-posts	1
yet.	1
I	1
only	1
want	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
direction."	1
Flambeau	1
gazed	1
at	1
his	1
friend	1
for	1
some	1
time,	1
with	1
an	1
expression	1
between	1
perplexity	1
and	1
amusement;	1
and	1
then,	1
rising	1
from	1
the	1
table;	1
squeezed	1
his	1
huge	1
form	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
dwarf	1
tavern,	1
and	1
melted	1
into	1
the	1
twilight.	1
Father	1
Brown	1
took	1
a	1
small	1
book	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
pocket	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
read	1
steadily;	1
he	1
betrayed	1
no	1
consciousness	1
of	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
red-haired	1
lady	1
had	1
left	1
her	1
own	1
table	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
opposite	1
him.	1
At	1
last	1
she	1
leaned	1
over	1
and	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
low,	1
strong	1
voice:	1
"Why	1
do	1
you	1
say	1
that?	1
How	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
it's	1
false?"	1
He	1
lifted	1
his	1
rather	1
heavy	1
eyelids,	1
which	1
fluttered	1
in	1
considerable	1
embarrassment.	1
Then	1
his	1
dubious	1
eye	1
roamed	1
again	1
to	1
the	1
white	1
lettering	1
on	1
the	1
glass	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
public-house.	1
The	1
young	1
woman's	1
eyes	1
followed	1
his,	1
and	1
rested	1
there	1
also,	1
but	1
in	1
pure	1
puzzledom.	1
"No,"	1
said	1
Father	1
Brown,	1
answering	1
her	1
thoughts.	1
"It	1
doesn't	1
say	1
`Sela',	1
like	1
the	1
thing	1
in	1
the	1
Psalms;	1
I	1
read	1
it	1
like	1
that	1
myself	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
wool-gathering	1
just	1
now;	1
it	1
says	1
`Ales.'"	1
"Well?"	1
inquired	1
the	1
staring	1
young	1
lady.	1
"What	1
does	1
it	1
matter	1
what	1
it	1
says?"	1
His	1
ruminating	1
eye	1
roved	1
to	1
the	1
girl's	1
light	1
canvas	1
sleeve,	1
round	1
the	1
wrist	1
of	1
which	1
ran	1
a	1
very	1
slight	1
thread	1
of	1
artistic	1
pattern,	1
just	1
enough	1
to	1
distinguish	1
it	1
from	1
a	1
working-dress	1
of	1
a	1
common	1
woman	1
and	1
make	1
it	1
more	1
like	1
the	1
working-dress	1
of	1
a	1
lady	1
art-student.	1
He	1
seemed	1
to	1
find	1
much	1
food	1
for	1
thought	1
in	1
this;	1
but	1
his	1
reply	1
was	1
very	1
slow	1
and	1
hesitant.	1
"You	1
see,	1
madam,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"from	1
outside	1
the	1
place	1
looks--well,	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
perfectly	1
decent	1
place--but	1
ladies	1
like	1
you	1
don't--don't	1
generally	1
think	1
so.	1
They	1
never	1
go	1
into	1
such	1
places	1
from	1
choice,	1
except--"	1
"Well?"	1
she	1
repeated.	1
"Except	1
an	1
unfortunate	1
few	1
who	1
don't	1
go	1
in	1
to	1
drink	1
milk."	1
"You	1
are	1
a	1
most	1
singular	1
person,"	1
said	1
the	1
young	1
lady.	1
"What	1
is	1
your	1
object	1
in	1
all	1
this?"	1
"Not	1
to	1
trouble	1
you	1
about	1
it,"	1
he	1
replied,	1
very	1
gently.	1
"Only	1
to	1
arm	1
myself	1
with	1
knowledge	1
enough	1
to	1
help	1
you,	1
if	1
ever	1
you	1
freely	1
ask	1
my	1
help."	1
"But	1
why	1
should	1
I	1
need	1
help?"	1
He	1
continued	1
his	1
dreamy	1
monologue.	1
"You	1
couldn't	1
have	1
come	1
in	1
to	1
see	1
protegees,	1
humble	1
friends,	1
that	1
sort	1
of	1
thing,	1
or	1
you'd	1
have	1
gone	1
through	1
into	1
the	1
parlour...and	1
you	1
couldn't	1
have	1
come	1
in	1
because	1
you	1
were	1
ill,	1
or	1
you'd	1
have	1
spoken	1
to	1
the	1
woman	1
of	1
the	1
place,	1
who's	1
obviously	1
respectable...besides,	1
you	1
don't	1
look	1
ill	1
in	1
that	1
way,	1
but	1
only	1
unhappy....	1
This	1
street	1
is	1
the	1
only	1
original	1
long	1
lane	1
that	1
has	1
no	1
turning;	1
and	1
the	1
houses	1
on	1
both	1
sides	1
are	1
shut	1
up....	1
I	1
could	1
only	1
suppose	1
that	1
you'd	1
seen	1
somebody	1
coming	1
whom	1
you	1
didn't	1
want	1
to	1
meet;	1
and	1
found	1
the	1
public-house	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
shelter	1
in	1
this	1
wilderness	1
of	1
stone....	1
I	1
don't	1
think	1
I	1
went	1
beyond	1
the	1
licence	1
of	1
a	1
stranger	1
in	1
glancing	1
at	1
the	1
only	1
man	1
who	1
passed	1
immediately	1
after....	1
And	1
as	1
I	1
thought	1
he	1
looked	1
like	1
the	1
wrong	1
sort...and	1
you	1
looked	1
like	1
the	1
right	1
sort....	1
I	1
held	1
myself	1
ready	1
to	1
help	1
if	1
he	1
annoyed	1
you;	1
that	1
is	1
all.	1
As	1
for	1
my	1
friend,	1
he'll	1
be	1
back	1
soon;	1
and	1
he	1
certainly	1
can't	1
find	1
out	1
anything	1
by	1
stumping	1
down	1
a	1
road	1
like	1
this....	1
I	1
didn't	1
think	1
he	1
could."	1
"Then	1
why	1
did	1
you	1
send	1
him	1
out?"	1
she	1
cried,	1
leaning	1
forward	1
with	1
yet	1
warmer	1
curiosity.	1
She	1
had	1
the	1
proud,	1
impetuous	1
face	1
that	1
goes	1
with	1
reddish	1
colouring,	1
and	1
a	1
Roman	1
nose,	1
as	1
it	1
did	1
in	1
Marie	1
Antoinette.	1
He	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
steadily	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time,	1
and	1
said:	1
"Because	1
I	1
hoped	1
you	1
would	1
speak	1
to	1
me."	1
She	1
looked	1
back	1
at	1
him	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
with	1
a	1
heated	1
face,	1
in	1
which	1
there	1
hung	1
a	1
red	1
shadow	1
of	1
anger;	1
then,	1
despite	1
her	1
anxieties,	1
humour	1
broke	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
eyes	1
and	1
the	1
corners	1
of	1
her	1
mouth,	1
and	1
she	1
answered	1
almost	1
grimly:	1
"Well,	1
if	1
you're	1
so	1
keen	1
on	1
my	1
conversation,	1
perhaps	1
you'll	1
answer	1
my	1
question."	1
After	1
a	1
pause	1
she	1
added:	1
"I	1
had	1
the	1
honour	1
to	1
ask	1
you	1
why	1
you	1
thought	1
the	1
man's	1
nose	1
was	1
false."	1
"The	1
wax	1
always	1
spots	1
like	1
that	1
just	1
a	1
little	1
in	1
this	1
weather,"	1
answered	1
Father	1
Brown	1
with	1
entire	1
simplicity,	1
"But	1
it's	1
such	1
a	1
crooked	1
nose,"	1
remonstrated	1
the	1
red-haired	1
girl.	1
The	1
priest	1
smiled	1
in	1
his	1
turn.	1
"I	1
don't	1
say	1
it's	1
the	1
sort	1
of	1
nose	1
one	1
would	1
wear	1
out	1
of	1
mere	1
foppery,"	1
he	1
admitted.	1
"This	1
man,	1
I	1
think,	1
wears	1
it	1
because	1
his	1
real	1
nose	1
is	1
so	1
much	1
nicer."	1
"But	1
why?"	1
she	1
insisted.	1
"What	1
is	1
the	1
nursery-rhyme?"	1
observed	1
Brown	1
absent-mindedly.	1
"There	1
was	1
a	1
crooked	1
man	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
a	1
crooked	1
mile....	1
That	1
man,	1
I	1
fancy,	1
has	1
gone	1
a	1
very	1
crooked	1
road--by	1
following	1
his	1
nose."	1
"Why,	1
what's	1
he	1
done?"	1
she	1
demanded,	1
rather	1
shakily.	1
"I	1
don't	1
want	1
to	1
force	1
your	1
confidence	1
by	1
a	1
hair,"	1
said	1
Father	1
Brown,	1
very	1
quietly.	1
"But	1
I	1
think	1
you	1
could	1
tell	1
me	1
more	1
about	1
that	1
than	1
I	1
can	1
tell	1
you."	1
The	1
girl	1
sprang	1
to	1
her	1
feet	1
and	1
stood	1
quite	1
quietly,	1
but	1
with	1
clenched	1
hands,	1
like	1
one	1
about	1
to	1
stride	1
away;	1
then	1
her	1
hands	1
loosened	1
slowly,	1
and	1
she	1
sat	1
down	1
again.	1
"You	1
are	1
more	1
of	1
a	1
mystery	1
than	1
all	1
the	1
others,"	1
she	1
said	1
desperately,	1
"but	1
I	1
feel	1
there	1
might	1
be	1
a	1
heart	1
in	1
your	1
mystery."	1
"What	1
we	1
all	1
dread	1
most,"	1
said	1
the	1
priest	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice,	1
"is	1
a	1
maze	1
with	1
no	1
centre.	1
That	1
is	1
why	1
atheism	1
is	1
only	1
a	1
nightmare."	1
"I	1
will	1
tell	1
you	1
everything,"	1
said	1
the	1
red-haired	1
girl	1
doggedly,	1
"except	1
why	1
I	1
am	1
telling	1
you;	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
don't	1
know."	1
She	1
picked	1
at	1
the	1
darned	1
table-cloth	1
and	1
went	1
on:	1
"You	1
look	1
as	1
if	1
you	1
knew	1
what	1
isn't	1
snobbery	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
what	1
is;	1
and	1
when	1
I	1
say	1
that	1
ours	1
is	1
a	1
good	1
old	1
family,	1
you'll	1
understand	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
necessary	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
story;	1
indeed,	1
my	1
chief	1
danger	1
is	1
in	1
my	1
brother's	1
high-and-dry	1
notions,	1
noblesse	1
oblige	1
and	1
all	1
that.	1
Well,	1
my	1
name	1
is	1
Christabel	1
Carstairs;	1
and	1
my	1
father	1
was	1
that	1
Colonel	1
Carstairs	1
you've	1
probably	1
heard	1
of,	1
who	1
made	1
the	1
famous	1
Carstairs	1
Collection	1
of	1
Roman	1
coins.	1
I	1
could	1
never	1
describe	1
my	1
father	1
to	1
you;	1
the	1
nearest	1
I	1
can	1
say	1
is	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
like	1
a	1
Roman	1
coin	1
himself.	1
He	1
was	1
as	1
handsome	1
and	1
as	1
genuine	1
and	1
as	1
valuable	1
and	1
as	1
metallic	1
and	1
as	1
out-of-date.	1
He	1
was	1
prouder	1
of	1
his	1
Collection	1
than	1
of	1
his	1
coat-of-arms--	1
nobody	1
could	1
say	1
more	1
than	1
that.	1
His	1
extraordinary	1
character	1
came	1
out	1
most	1
in	1
his	1
will.	1
He	1
had	1
two	1
sons	1
and	1
one	1
daughter.	1
He	1
quarrelled	1
with	1
one	1
son,	1
my	1
brother	1
Giles,	1
and	1
sent	1
him	1
to	1
Australia	1
on	1
a	1
small	1
allowance.	1
He	1
then	1
made	1
a	1
will	1
leaving	1
the	1
Carstairs	1
Collection,	1
actually	1
with	1
a	1
yet	1
smaller	1
allowance,	1
to	1
my	1
brother	1
Arthur.	1
He	1
meant	1
it	1
as	1
a	1
reward,	1
as	1
the	1
highest	1
honour	1
he	1
could	1
offer,	1
in	1
acknowledgement	1
of	1
Arthur's	1
loyalty	1
and	1
rectitude	1
and	1
the	1
distinctions	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
gained	1
in	1
mathematics	1
and	1
economics	1
at	1
Cambridge.	1
He	1
left	1
me	1
practically	1
all	1
his	1
pretty	1
large	1
fortune;	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
he	1
meant	1
it	1
in	1
contempt.	1
"Arthur,	1
you	1
may	1
say,	1
might	1
well	1
complain	1
of	1
this;	1
but	1
Arthur	1
is	1
my	1
father	1
over	1
again.	1
Though	1
he	1
had	1
some	1
differences	1
with	1
my	1
father	1
in	1
early	1
youth,	1
no	1
sooner	1
had	1
he	1
taken	1
over	1
the	1
Collection	1
than	1
he	1
became	1
like	1
a	1
pagan	1
priest	1
dedicated	1
to	1
a	1
temple.	1
He	1
mixed	1
up	1
these	1
Roman	1
halfpence	1
with	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
the	1
Carstairs	1
family	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
stiff,	1
idolatrous	1
way	1
as	1
his	1
father	1
before	1
him.	1
He	1
acted	1
as	1
if	1
Roman	1
money	1
must	1
be	1
guarded	1
by	1
all	1
the	1
Roman	1
virtues.	1
He	1
took	1
no	1
pleasures;	1
he	1
spent	1
nothing	1
on	1
himself;	1
he	1
lived	1
for	1
the	1
Collection.	1
Often	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
trouble	1
to	1
dress	1
for	1
his	1
simple	1
meals;	1
but	1
pattered	1
about	1
among	1
the	1
corded	1
brown-paper	1
parcels	1
(which	1
no	1
one	1
else	1
was	1
allowed	1
to	1
touch)	1
in	1
an	1
old	1
brown	1
dressing-gown.	1
With	1
its	1
rope	1
and	1
tassel	1
and	1
his	1
pale,	1
thin,	1
refined	1
face,	1
it	1
made	1
him	1
look	1
like	1
an	1
old	1
ascetic	1
monk.	1
Every	1
now	1
and	1
then,	1
though,	1
he	1
would	1
appear	1
dressed	1
like	1
a	1
decidedly	1
fashionable	1
gentleman;	1
but	1
that	1
was	1
only	1
when	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
London	1
sales	1
or	1
shops	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
addition	1
to	1
the	1
Carstairs	1
Collection.	1
"Now,	1
if	1
you've	1
known	1
any	1
young	1
people,	1
you	1
won't	1
be	1
shocked	1
if	1
I	1
say	1
that	1
I	1
got	1
into	1
rather	1
a	1
low	1
frame	1
of	1
mind	1
with	1
all	1
this;	1
the	1
frame	1
of	1
mind	1
in	1
which	1
one	1
begins	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
the	1
Ancient	1
Romans	1
were	1
all	1
very	1
well	1
in	1
their	1
way.	1
I'm	1
not	1
like	1
my	1
brother	1
Arthur;	1
I	1
can't	1
help	1
enjoying	1
enjoyment.	1
I	1
got	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
romance	1
and	1
rubbish	1
where	1
I	1
got	1
my	1
red	1
hair,	1
from	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
family.	1
Poor	1
Giles	1
was	1
the	1
same;	1
and	1
I	1
think	1
the	1
atmosphere	1
of	1
coins	1
might	1
count	1
in	1
excuse	1
for	1
him;	1
though	1
he	1
really	1
did	1
wrong	1
and	1
nearly	1
went	1
to	1
prison.	1
But	1
he	1
didn't	1
behave	1
any	1
worse	1
than	1
I	1
did;	1
as	1
you	1
shall	1
hear.	1
"I	1
come	1
now	1
to	1
the	1
silly	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
story.	1
I	1
think	1
a	1
man	1
as	1
clever	1
as	1
you	1
can	1
guess	1
the	1
sort	1
of	1
thing	1
that	1
would	1
begin	1
to	1
relieve	1
the	1
monotony	1
for	1
an	1
unruly	1
girl	1
of	1
seventeen	1
placed	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
position.	1
But	1
I	1
am	1
so	1
rattled	1
with	1
more	1
dreadful	1
things	1
that	1
I	1
can	1
hardly	1
read	1
my	1
own	1
feeling;	1
and	1
don't	1
know	1
whether	1
I	1
despise	1
it	1
now	1
as	1
a	1
flirtation	1
or	1
bear	1
it	1
as	1
a	1
broken	1
heart.	1
We	1
lived	1
then	1
at	1
a	1
little	1
seaside	1
watering-place	1
in	1
South	1
Wales,	1
and	1
a	1
retired	1
sea-captain	1
living	1
a	1
few	1
doors	1
off	1
had	1
a	1
son	1
about	1
five	1
years	1
older	1
than	1
myself,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
friend	1
of	1
Giles	1
before	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
Colonies.	1
His	1
name	1
does	1
not	1
affect	1
my	1
tale;	1
but	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
it	1
was	1
Philip	1
Hawker,	1
because	1
I	1
am	1
telling	1
you	1
everything.	1
We	1
used	1
to	1
go	1
shrimping	1
together,	1
and	1
said	1
and	1
thought	1
we	1
were	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
each	1
other;	1
at	1
least	1
he	1
certainly	1
said	1
he	1
was,	1
and	1
I	1
certainly	1
thought	1
I	1
was.	1
If	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
he	1
had	1
bronzed	1
curly	1
hair	1
and	1
a	1
falconish	1
sort	1
of	1
face,	1
bronzed	1
by	1
the	1
sea	1
also,	1
it's	1
not	1
for	1
his	1
sake,	1
I	1
assure	1
you,	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
story;	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
a	1
very	1
curious	1
coincidence.	1
"One	1
summer	1
afternoon,	1
when	1
I	1
had	1
promised	1
to	1
go	1
shrimping	1
along	1
the	1
sands	1
with	1
Philip,	1
I	1
was	1
waiting	1
rather	1
impatiently	1
in	1
the	1
front	1
drawing-room,	1
watching	1
Arthur	1
handle	1
some	1
packets	1
of	1
coins	1
he	1
had	1
just	1
purchased	1
and	1
slowly	1
shunt	1
them,	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
at	1
a	1
time,	1
into	1
his	1
own	1
dark	1
study	1
and	1
museum	1
which	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
the	1
house.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
heavy	1
door	1
close	1
on	1
him	1
finally,	1
I	1
made	1
a	1
bolt	1
for	1
my	1
shrimping-net	1
and	1
tam-o'-shanter	1
and	1
was	1
just	1
going	1
to	1
slip	1
out,	1
when	1
I	1
saw	1
that	1
my	1
brother	1
had	1
left	1
behind	1
him	1
one	1
coin	1
that	1
lay	1
gleaming	1
on	1
the	1
long	1
bench	1
by	1
the	1
window.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
bronze	1
coin,	1
and	1
the	1
colour,	1
combined	1
with	1
the	1
exact	1
curve	1
of	1
the	1
Roman	1
nose	1
and	1
something	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
lift	1
of	1
the	1
long,	1
wiry	1
neck,	1
made	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
Caesar	1
on	1
it	1
the	1
almost	1
precise	1
portrait	1
of	1
Philip	1
Hawker.	1
Then	1
I	1
suddenly	1
remembered	1
Giles	1
telling	1
Philip	1
of	1
a	1
coin	1
that	1
was	1
like	1
him,	1
and	1
Philip	1
wishing	1
he	1
had	1
it.	1
Perhaps	1
you	1
can	1
fancy	1
the	1
wild,	1
foolish	1
thoughts	1
with	1
which	1
my	1
head	1
went	1
round;	1
I	1
felt	1
as	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
had	1
a	1
gift	1
from	1
the	1
fairies.	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
if	1
I	1
could	1
only	1
run	1
away	1
with	1
this,	1
and	1
give	1
it	1
to	1
Philip	1
like	1
a	1
wild	1
sort	1
of	1
wedding-ring,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
bond	1
between	1
us	1
for	1
ever;	1
I	1
felt	1
a	1
thousand	1
such	1
things	1
at	1
once.	1
Then	1
there	1
yawned	1
under	1
me,	1
like	1
the	1
pit,	1
the	1
enormous,	1
awful	1
notion	1
of	1
what	1
I	1
was	1
doing;	1
above	1
all,	1
the	1
unbearable	1
thought,	1
which	1
was	1
like	1
touching	1
hot	1
iron,	1
of	1
what	1
Arthur	1
would	1
think	1
of	1
it.	1
A	1
Carstairs	1
a	1
thief;	1
and	1
a	1
thief	1
of	1
the	1
Carstairs	1
treasure!	1
I	1
believe	1
my	1
brother	1
could	1
see	1
me	1
burned	1
like	1
a	1
witch	1
for	1
such	1
a	1
thing,	1
But	1
then,	1
the	1
very	1
thought	1
of	1
such	1
fanatical	1
cruelty	1
heightened	1
my	1
old	1
hatred	1
of	1
his	1
dingy	1
old	1
antiquarian	1
fussiness	1
and	1
my	1
longing	1
for	1
the	1
youth	1
and	1
liberty	1
that	1
called	1
to	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
sea.	1
Outside	1
was	1
strong	1
sunlight	1
with	1
a	1
wind;	1
and	1
a	1
yellow	1
head	1
of	1
some	1
broom	1
or	1
gorse	1
in	1
the	1
garden	1
rapped	1
against	1
the	1
glass	1
of	1
the	1
window.	1
I	1
thought	1
of	1
that	1
living	1
and	1
growing	1
gold	1
calling	1
to	1
me	1
from	1
all	1
the	1
heaths	1
of	1
the	1
world--and	1
then	1
of	1
that	1
dead,	1
dull	1
gold	1
and	1
bronze	1
and	1
brass	1
of	1
my	1
brother's	1
growing	1
dustier	1
and	1
dustier	1
as	1
life	1
went	1
by.	1
Nature	1
and	1
the	1
Carstairs	1
Collection	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
grips	1
at	1
last.	1
"Nature	1
is	1
older	1
than	1
the	1
Carstairs	1
Collection.	1
As	1
I	1
ran	1
down	1
the	1
streets	1
to	1
the	1
sea,	1
the	1
coin	1
clenched	1
tight	1
in	1
my	1
fist,	1
I	1
felt	1
all	1
the	1
Roman	1
Empire	1
on	1
my	1
back	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
Carstairs	1
pedigree.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
only	1
the	1
old	1
lion	1
argent	1
that	1
was	1
roaring	1
in	1
my	1
ear,	1
but	1
all	1
the	1
eagles	1
of	1
the	1
Caesars	1
seemed	1
flapping	1
and	1
screaming	1
in	1
pursuit	1
of	1
me.	1
And	1
yet	1
my	1
heart	1
rose	1
higher	1
and	1
higher	1
like	1
a	1
child's	1
kite,	1
until	1
I	1
came	1
over	1
the	1
loose,	1
dry	1
sand-hills	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
flat,	1
wet	1
sands,	1
where	1
Philip	1
stood	1
already	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
ankles	1
in	1
the	1
shallow	1
shining	1
water,	1
some	1
hundred	1
yards	1
out	1
to	1
sea.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
red	1
sunset;	1
and	1
the	1
long	1
stretch	1
of	1
low	1
water,	1
hardly	1
rising	1
over	1
the	1
ankle	1
for	1
half	1
a	1
mile,	1
was	1
like	1
a	1
lake	1
of	1
ruby	1
flame.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
till	1
I	1
had	1
torn	1
off	1
my	1
shoes	1
and	1
stockings	1
and	1
waded	1
to	1
where	1
he	1
stood,	1
which	1
was	1
well	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
dry	1
land,	1
that	1
I	1
turned	1
and	1
looked	1
round.	1
We	1
were	1
quite	1
alone	1
in	1
a	1
circle	1
of	1
sea-water	1
and	1
wet	1
sand,	1
and	1
I	1
gave	1
him	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
Caesar.	1
"At	1
the	1
very	1
instant	1
I	1
had	1
a	1
shock	1
of	1
fancy:	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
far	1
away	1
on	1
the	1
sand-hills	1
was	1
looking	1
at	1
me	1
intently.	1
I	1
must	1
have	1
felt	1
immediately	1
after	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
mere	1
leap	1
of	1
unreasonable	1
nerves;	1
for	1
the	1
man	1
was	1
only	1
a	1
dark	1
dot	1
in	1
the	1
distance,	1
and	1
I	1
could	1
only	1
just	1
see	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
standing	1
quite	1
still	1
and	1
gazing,	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
a	1
little	1
on	1
one	1
side.	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
earthly	1
logical	1
evidence	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
looking	1
at	1
me;	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
looking	1
at	1
a	1
ship,	1
or	1
the	1
sunset,	1
or	1
the	1
sea-gulls,	1
or	1
at	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
still	1
strayed	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
on	1
the	1
shore	1
between	1
us.	1
Nevertheless,	1
whatever	1
my	1
start	1
sprang	1
from	1
was	1
prophetic;	1
for,	1
as	1
I	1
gazed,	1
he	1
started	1
walking	1
briskly	1
in	1
a	1
bee-line	1
towards	1
us	1
across	1
the	1
wide	1
wet	1
sands.	1
As	1
he	1
drew	1
nearer	1
and	1
nearer	1
I	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
dark	1
and	1
bearded,	1
and	1
that	1
his	1
eyes	1
were	1
marked	1
with	1
dark	1
spectacles.	1
He	1
was	1
dressed	1
poorly	1
but	1
respectably	1
in	1
black,	1
from	1
the	1
old	1
black	1
top	1
hat	1
on	1
his	1
head	1
to	1
the	1
solid	1
black	1
boots	1
on	1
his	1
feet.	1
In	1
spite	1
of	1
these	1
he	1
walked	1
straight	1
into	1
the	1
sea	1
without	1
a	1
flash	1
of	1
hesitation,	1
and	1
came	1
on	1
at	1
me	1
with	1
the	1
steadiness	1
of	1
a	1
travelling	1
bullet.	1
"I	1
can't	1
tell	1
you	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
monstrosity	1
and	1
miracle	1
I	1
had	1
when	1
he	1
thus	1
silently	1
burst	1
the	1
barrier	1
between	1
land	1
and	1
water.	1
It	1
was	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
walked	1
straight	1
off	1
a	1
cliff	1
and	1
still	1
marched	1
steadily	1
in	1
mid-air.	1
It	1
was	1
as	1
if	1
a	1
house	1
had	1
flown	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
sky	1
or	1
a	1
man's	1
head	1
had	1
fallen	1
off.	1
He	1
was	1
only	1
wetting	1
his	1
boots;	1
but	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
demon	1
disregarding	1
a	1
law	1
of	1
Nature.	1
If	1
he	1
had	1
hesitated	1
an	1
instant	1
at	1
the	1
water's	1
edge	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
nothing.	1
As	1
it	1
was,	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
look	1
so	1
much	1
at	1
me	1
alone	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
notice	1
the	1
ocean.	1
Philip	1
was	1
some	1
yards	1
away	1
with	1
his	1
back	1
to	1
me,	1
bending	1
over	1
his	1
net.	1
The	1
stranger	1
came	1
on	1
till	1
he	1
stood	1
within	1
two	1
yards	1
of	1
me,	1
the	1
water	1
washing	1
half-way	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
knees.	1
Then	1
he	1
said,	1
with	1
a	1
clearly	1
modulated	1
and	1
rather	1
mincing	1
articulation:	1
`Would	1
it	1
discommode	1
you	1
to	1
contribute	1
elsewhere	1
a	1
coin	1
with	1
a	1
somewhat	1
different	1
superscription?'	1
"With	1
one	1
exception	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
definably	1
abnormal	1
about	1
him.	1
His	1
tinted	1
glasses	1
were	1
not	1
really	1
opaque,	1
but	1
of	1
a	1
blue	1
kind	1
common	1
enough,	1
nor	1
were	1
the	1
eyes	1
behind	1
them	1
shifty,	1
but	1
regarded	1
me	1
steadily.	1
His	1
dark	1
beard	1
was	1
not	1
really	1
long	1
or	1
wild--,	1
but	1
he	1
looked	1
rather	1
hairy,	1
because	1
the	1
beard	1
began	1
very	1
high	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
face,	1
just	1
under	1
the	1
cheek-bones.	1
His	1
complexion	1
was	1
neither	1
sallow	1
nor	1
livid,	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
rather	1
clear	1
and	1
youthful;	1
yet	1
this	1
gave	1
a	1
pink-and-white	1
wax	1
look	1
which	1
somehow	1
(I	1
don't	1
know	1
why)	1
rather	1
increased	1
the	1
horror.	1
The	1
only	1
oddity	1
one	1
could	1
fix	1
was	1
that	1
his	1
nose,	1
which	1
was	1
otherwise	1
of	1
a	1
good	1
shape,	1
was	1
just	1
slightly	1
turned	1
sideways	1
at	1
the	1
tip;	1
as	1
if,	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
soft,	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
tapped	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
with	1
a	1
toy	1
hammer.	1
The	1
thing	1
was	1
hardly	1
a	1
deformity;	1
yet	1
I	1
cannot	1
tell	1
you	1
what	1
a	1
living	1
nightmare	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
me.	1
As	1
he	1
stood	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
sunset-stained	1
water	1
he	1
affected	1
me	1
as	1
some	1
hellish	1
sea-monster	1
just	1
risen	1
roaring	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
sea	1
like	1
blood.	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
why	1
a	1
touch	1
on	1
the	1
nose	1
should	1
affect	1
my	1
imagination	1
so	1
much.	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
seemed	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
could	1
move	1
his	1
nose	1
like	1
a	1
finger.	1
And	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
just	1
that	1
moment	1
moved	1
it.	1
"`Any	1
little	1
assistance,'	1
he	1
continued	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
queer,	1
priggish	1
accent,	1
`that	1
may	1
obviate	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
my	1
communicating	1
with	1
the	1
family.'	1
"Then	1
it	1
rushed	1
over	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
being	1
blackmailed	1
for	1
the	1
theft	1
of	1
the	1
bronze	1
piece;	1
and	1
all	1
my	1
merely	1
superstitious	1
fears	1
and	1
doubts	1
were	1
swallowed	1
up	1
in	1
one	1
overpowering,	1
practical	1
question.	1
How	1
could	1
he	1
have	1
found	1
out?	1
I	1
had	1
stolen	1
the	1
thing	1
suddenly	1
and	1
on	1
impulse;	1
I	1
was	1
certainly	1
alone;	1
for	1
I	1
always	1
made	1
sure	1
of	1
being	1
unobserved	1
when	1
I	1
slipped	1
out	1
to	1
see	1
Philip	1
in	1
this	1
way.	1
I	1
had	1
not,	1
to	1
all	1
appearance,	1
been	1
followed	1
in	1
the	1
street;	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
had,	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
`X-ray'	1
the	1
coin	1
in	1
my	1
closed	1
hand.	1
The	1
man	1
standing	1
on	1
the	1
sand-hills	1
could	1
no	1
more	1
have	1
seen	1
what	1
I	1
gave	1
Philip	1
than	1
shoot	1
a	1
fly	1
in	1
one	1
eye,	1
like	1
the	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
fairy-tale.	1
"`Philip,'	1
I	1
cried	1
helplessly,	1
`ask	1
this	1
man	1
what	1
he	1
wants.'	1
"When	1
Philip	1
lifted	1
his	1
head	1
at	1
last	1
from	1
mending	1
his	1
net	1
he	1
looked	1
rather	1
red,	1
as	1
if	1
sulky	1
or	1
ashamed;	1
but	1
it	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
only	1
the	1
exertion	1
of	1
stooping	1
and	1
the	1
red	1
evening	1
light;	1
I	1
may	1
have	1
only	1
had	1
another	1
of	1
the	1
morbid	1
fancies	1
that	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
dancing	1
about	1
me.	1
He	1
merely	1
said	1
gruffly	1
to	1
the	1
man:	1
`You	1
clear	1
out	1
of	1
this.'	1
And,	1
motioning	1
me	1
to	1
follow,	1
set	1
off	1
wading	1
shoreward	1
without	1
paying	1
further	1
attention	1
to	1
him.	1
He	1
stepped	1
on	1
to	1
a	1
stone	1
breakwater	1
that	1
ran	1
out	1
from	1
among	1
the	1
roots	1
of	1
the	1
sand-hills,	1
and	1
so	1
struck	1
homeward,	1
perhaps	1
thinking	1
our	1
incubus	1
would	1
find	1
it	1
less	1
easy	1
to	1
walk	1
on	1
such	1
rough	1
stones,	1
green	1
and	1
slippery	1
with	1
seaweed,	1
than	1
we,	1
who	1
were	1
young	1
and	1
used	1
to	1
it.	1
But	1
my	1
persecutor	1
walked	1
as	1
daintily	1
as	1
he	1
talked;	1
and	1
he	1
still	1
followed	1
me,	1
picking	1
his	1
way	1
and	1
picking	1
his	1
phrases.	1
I	1
heard	1
his	1
delicate,	1
detestable	1
voice	1
appealing	1
to	1
me	1
over	1
my	1
shoulder,	1
until	1
at	1
last,	1
when	1
we	1
had	1
crested	1
the	1
sand-hills,	1
Philip's	1
patience	1
(which	1
was	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
so	1
conspicuous	1
on	1
most	1
occasions)	1
seemed	1
to	1
snap.	1
He	1
turned	1
suddenly,	1
saying,	1
`Go	1
back.	1
I	1
can't	1
talk	1
to	1
you	1
now.'	1
And	1
as	1
the	1
man	1
hovered	1
and	1
opened	1
his	1
mouth,	1
Philip	1
struck	1
him	1
a	1
buffet	1
on	1
it	1
that	1
sent	1
him	1
flying	1
from	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
tallest	1
sand-hill	1
to	1
the	1
bottom.	1
I	1
saw	1
him	1
crawling	1
out	1
below,	1
covered	1
with	1
sand.	1
"This	1
stroke	1
comforted	1
me	1
somehow,	1
though	1
it	1
might	1
well	1
increase	1
my	1
peril;	1
but	1
Philip	1
showed	1
none	1
of	1
his	1
usual	1
elation	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
prowess.	1
Though	1
as	1
affectionate	1
as	1
ever,	1
he	1
still	1
seemed	1
cast	1
down;	1
and	1
before	1
I	1
could	1
ask	1
him	1
anything	1
fully,	1
he	1
parted	1
with	1
me	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
gate,	1
with	1
two	1
remarks	1
that	1
struck	1
me	1
as	1
strange.	1
He	1
said	1
that,	1
all	1
things	1
considered,	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
put	1
the	1
coin	1
back	1
in	1
the	1
Collection;	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
himself	1
would	1
keep	1
it	1
`for	1
the	1
present'.	1
And	1
then	1
he	1
added	1
quite	1
suddenly	1
and	1
irrelevantly:,	1
`You	1
know	1
Giles	1
is	1
back	1
from	1
Australia?'"	1
The	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
tavern	1
opened	1
and	1
the	1
gigantic	1
shadow	1
of	1
the	1
investigator	1
Flambeau	1
fell	1
across	1
the	1
table.	1
Father	1
Brown	1
presented	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
lady	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
slight,	1
persuasive	1
style	1
of	1
speech,	1
mentioning	1
his	1
knowledge	1
and	1
sympathy	1
in	1
such	1
cases;	1
and	1
almost	1
without	1
knowing,	1
the	1
girl	1
was	1
soon	1
reiterating	1
her	1
story	1
to	1
two	1
listeners.	1
But	1
Flambeau,	1
as	1
he	1
bowed	1
and	1
sat	1
down,	1
handed	1
the	1
priest	1
a	1
small	1
slip	1
of	1
paper.	1
Brown	1
accepted	1
it	1
with	1
some	1
surprise	1
and	1
read	1
on	1
it:	1
"Cab	1
to	1
Wagga	1
Wagga,	1
379,	1
Mafeking	1
Avenue,	1
Putney."	1
The	1
girl	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
with	1
her	1
story.	1
"I	1
went	1
up	1
the	1
steep	1
street	1
to	1
my	1
own	1
house	1
with	1
my	1
head	1
in	1
a	1
whirl;	1
it	1
had	1
not	1
begun	1
to	1
clear	1
when	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
doorstep,	1
on	1
which	1
I	1
found	1
a	1
milk-can--and	1
the	1
man	1
with	1
the	1
twisted	1
nose.	1
The	1
milk-can	1
told	1
me	1
the	1
servants	1
were	1
all	1
out;	1
for,	1
of	1
course,	1
Arthur,	1
browsing	1
about	1
in	1
his	1
brown	1
dressing-gown	1
in	1
a	1
brown	1
study,	1
would	1
not	1
hear	1
or	1
answer	1
a	1
bell.	1
Thus	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
help	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
house,	1
except	1
my	1
brother,	1
whose	1
help	1
must	1
be	1
my	1
ruin.	1
In	1
desperation	1
I	1
thrust	1
two	1
shillings	1
into	1
the	1
horrid	1
thing's	1
hand,	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
to	1
call	1
again	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
days,	1
when	1
I	1
had	1
thought	1
it	1
out.	1
He	1
went	1
off	1
sulking,	1
but	1
more	1
sheepishly	1
than	1
I	1
had	1
expected--	1
perhaps	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
shaken	1
by	1
his	1
fall--and	1
I	1
watched	1
the	1
star	1
of	1
sand	1
splashed	1
on	1
his	1
back	1
receding	1
down	1
the	1
road	1
with	1
a	1
horrid	1
vindictive	1
pleasure.	1
He	1
turned	1
a	1
corner	1
some	1
six	1
houses	1
down.	1
"Then	1
I	1
let	1
myself	1
in,	1
made	1
myself	1
some	1
tea,	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
think	1
it	1
out.	1
I	1
sat	1
at	1
the	1
drawing-room	1
window	1
looking	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
garden,	1
which	1
still	1
glowed	1
with	1
the	1
last	1
full	1
evening	1
light.	1
But	1
I	1
was	1
too	1
distracted	1
and	1
dreamy	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
lawns	1
and	1
flower-pots	1
and	1
flower-beds	1
with	1
any	1
concentration.	1
So	1
I	1
took	1
the	1
shock	1
the	1
more	1
sharply	1
because	1
I'd	1
seen	1
it	1
so	1
slowly.	1
"The	1
man	1
or	1
monster	1
I'd	1
sent	1
away	1
was	1
standing	1
quite	1
still	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
garden.	1
Oh,	1
we've	1
all	1
read	1
a	1
lot	1
about	1
pale-faced	1
phantoms	1
in	1
the	1
dark;	1
but	1
this	1
was	1
more	1
dreadful	1
than	1
anything	1
of	1
that	1
kind	1
could	1
ever	1
be.	1
Because,	1
though	1
he	1
cast	1
a	1
long	1
evening	1
shadow,	1
he	1
still	1
stood	1
in	1
warm	1
sunlight.	1
And	1
because	1
his	1
face	1
was	1
not	1
pale,	1
but	1
had	1
that	1
waxen	1
bloom	1
still	1
upon	1
it	1
that	1
belongs	1
to	1
a	1
barber's	1
dummy.	1
He	1
stood	1
quite	1
still,	1
with	1
his	1
face	1
towards	1
me;	1
and	1
I	1
can't	1
tell	1
you	1
how	1
horrid	1
he	1
looked	1
among	1
the	1
tulips	1
and	1
all	1
those	1
tall,	1
gaudy,	1
almost	1
hothouse-looking	1
flowers.	1
It	1
looked	1
as	1
if	1
we'd	1
stuck	1
up	1
a	1
waxwork	1
instead	1
of	1
a	1
statue	1
in	1
the	1
centre	1
of	1
our	1
garden.	1
"Yet	1
almost	1
the	1
instant	1
he	1
saw	1
me	1
move	1
in	1
the	1
window	1
he	1
turned	1
and	1
ran	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
garden	1
by	1
the	1
back	1
gate,	1
which	1
stood	1
open	1
and	1
by	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
undoubtedly	1
entered.	1
This	1
renewed	1
timidity	1
on	1
his	1
part	1
was	1
so	1
different	1
from	1
the	1
impudence	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
walked	1
into	1
the	1
sea,	1
that	1
I	1
felt	1
vaguely	1
comforted.	1
I	1
fancied,	1
perhaps,	1
that	1
he	1
feared	1
confronting	1
Arthur	1
more	1
than	1
I	1
knew.	1
Anyhow,	1
I	1
settled	1
down	1
at	1
last,	1
and	1
had	1
a	1
quiet	1
dinner	1
alone	1
(for	1
it	1
was	1
against	1
the	1
rules	1
to	1
disturb	1
Arthur	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
rearranging	1
the	1
museum),	1
and,	1
my	1
thoughts,	1
a	1
little	1
released,	1
fled	1
to	1
Philip	1
and	1
lost	1
themselves,	1
I	1
suppose.	1
Anyhow,	1
I	1
was	1
looking	1
blankly,	1
but	1
rather	1
pleasantly	1
than	1
otherwise,	1
at	1
another	1
window,	1
uncurtained,	1
but	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
black	1
as	1
a	1
slate	1
with	1
the	1
final	1
night-fall.	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
something	1
like	1
a	1
snail	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
outside	1
of	1
the	1
window-pane.	1
But	1
when	1
I	1
stared	1
harder,	1
it	1
was	1
more	1
like	1
a	1
man's	1
thumb	1
pressed	1
on	1
the	1
pane;	1
it	1
had	1
that	1
curled	1
look	1
that	1
a	1
thumb	1
has.	1
With	1
my	1
fear	1
and	1
courage	1
re-awakened	1
together,	1
I	1
rushed	1
at	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
then	1
recoiled	1
with	1
a	1
strangled	1
scream	1
that	1
any	1
man	1
but	1
Arthur	1
must	1
have	1
heard.	1
"For	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
thumb,	1
any	1
more	1
than	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
snail.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
tip	1
of	1
a	1
crooked	1
nose,	1
crushed	1
against	1
the	1
glass;	1
it	1
looked	1
white	1
with	1
the	1
pressure;	1
and	1
the	1
staring	1
face	1
and	1
eyes	1
behind	1
it	1
were	1
at	1
first	1
invisible	1
and	1
afterwards	1
grey	1
like	1
a	1
ghost.	1
I	1
slammed	1
the	1
shutters	1
together	1
somehow,	1
rushed	1
up	1
to	1
my	1
room	1
and	1
locked	1
myself	1
in.	1
But,	1
even	1
as	1
I	1
passed,	1
I	1
could	1
swear	1
I	1
saw	1
a	1
second	1
black	1
window	1
with	1
something	1
on	1
it	1
that	1
was	1
like	1
a	1
snail.	1
"It	1
might	1
be	1
best	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
Arthur	1
after	1
all.	1
If	1
the	1
thing	1
was	1
crawling	1
close	1
all	1
around	1
the	1
house	1
like	1
a	1
cat,	1
it	1
might	1
have	1
purposes	1
worse	1
even	1
than	1
blackmail.	1
My	1
brother	1
might	1
cast	1
me	1
out	1
and	1
curse	1
me	1
for	1
ever,	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
gentleman,	1
and	1
would	1
defend	1
me	1
on	1
the	1
spot.	1
After	1
ten	1
minutes'	1
curious	1
thinking,	1
I	1
went	1
down,	1
knocked	1
on	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
then	1
went	1
in:	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
last	1
and	1
worst	1
sight.	1
"My	1
brother's	1
chair	1
was	1
empty,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
obviously	1
out.	1
But	1
the	1
man	1
with	1
the	1
crooked	1
nose	1
was	1
sitting	1
waiting	1
for	1
his	1
return,	1
with	1
his	1
hat	1
still	1
insolently	1
on	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
actually	1
reading	1
one	1
of	1
my	1
brother's	1
books	1
under	1
my	1
brother's	1
lamp.	1
His	1
face	1
was	1
composed	1
and	1
occupied,	1
but	1
his	1
nose-tip	1
still	1
had	1
the	1
air	1
of	1
being	1
the	1
most	1
mobile	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
face,	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
just	1
turned	1
from	1
left	1
to	1
right	1
like	1
an	1
elephant's	1
proboscis.	1
I	1
had	1
thought	1
him	1
poisonous	1
enough	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
pursuing	1
and	1
watching	1
me;	1
but	1
I	1
think	1
his	1
unconsciousness	1
of	1
my	1
presence	1
was	1
more	1
frightful	1
still.	1
"I	1
think	1
I	1
screamed	1
loud	1
and	1
long;	1
but	1
that	1
doesn't	1
matter.	1
What	1
I	1
did	1
next	1
does	1
matter:	1
I	1
gave	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
money	1
I	1
had,	1
including	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
in	1
paper	1
which,	1
though	1
it	1
was	1
mine,	1
I	1
dare	1
say	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
right	1
to	1
touch.	1
He	1
went	1
off	1
at	1
last,	1
with	1
hateful,	1
tactful	1
regrets	1
all	1
in	1
long	1
words;	1
and	1
I	1
sat	1
down,	1
feeling	1
ruined	1
in	1
every	1
sense.	1
And	1
yet	1
I	1
was	1
saved	1
that	1
very	1
night	1
by	1
a	1
pure	1
accident.	1
Arthur	1
had	1
gone	1
off	1
suddenly	1
to	1
London,	1
as	1
he	1
so	1
often	1
did,	1
for	1
bargains;	1
and	1
returned,	1
late	1
but	1
radiant,	1
having	1
nearly	1
secured	1
a	1
treasure	1
that	1
was	1
an	1
added	1
splendour	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
family	1
Collection.	1
He	1
was	1
so	1
resplendent	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
almost	1
emboldened	1
to	1
confess	1
the	1
abstraction	1
of	1
the	1
lesser	1
gem--,	1
but	1
he	1
bore	1
down	1
all	1
other	1
topics	1
with	1
his	1
over-powering	1
projects.	1
Because	1
the	1
bargain	1
might	1
still	1
misfire	1
any	1
moment,	1
he	1
insisted	1
on	1
my	1
packing	1
at	1
once	1
and	1
going	1
up	1
with	1
him	1
to	1
lodgings	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
taken	1
in	1
Fulham,	1
to	1
be	1
near	1
the	1
curio-shop	1
in	1
question.	1
Thus	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
myself,	1
I	1
fled	1
from	1
my	1
foe	1
almost	1
in	1
the	1
dead	1
of	1
night--but	1
from	1
Philip	1
also....	1
My	1
brother	1
was	1
often	1
at	1
the	1
South	1
Kensington	1
Museum,	1
and,	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
make	1
some	1
sort	1
of	1
secondary	1
life	1
for	1
myself,	1
I	1
paid	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
lessons	1
at	1
the	1
Art	1
Schools.	1
I	1
was	1
coming	1
back	1
from	1
them	1
this	1
evening,	1
when	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
abomination	1
of	1
desolation	1
walking	1
alive	1
down	1
the	1
long	1
straight	1
street	1
and	1
the	1
rest	1
is	1
as	1
this	1
gentleman	1
has	1
said.	1
"I've	1
got	1
only	1
one	1
thing	1
to	1
say.	1
I	1
don't	1
deserve	1
to	1
be	1
helped;	1
and	1
I	1
don't	1
question	1
or	1
complain	1
of	1
my	1
punishment;	1
it	1
is	1
just,	1
it	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
happened.	1
But	1
I	1
still	1
question,	1
with	1
bursting	1
brains,	1
how	1
it	1
can	1
have	1
happened.	1
Am	1
I	1
punished	1
by	1
miracle?	1
or	1
how	1
can	1
anyone	1
but	1
Philip	1
and	1
myself	1
know	1
I	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
tiny	1
coin	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
sea?"	1
"It	1
is	1
an	1
extraordinary	1
problem,"	1
admitted	1
Flambeau.	1
"Not	1
so	1
extraordinary	1
as	1
the	1
answer,"	1
remarked	1
Father	1
Brown	1
rather	1
gloomily.	1
"Miss	1
Carstairs,	1
will	1
you	1
be	1
at	1
home	1
if	1
we	1
call	1
at	1
your	1
Fulham	1
place	1
in	1
an	1
hour	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
hence?"	1
The	1
girl	1
looked	1
at	1
him,	1
and	1
then	1
rose	1
and	1
put	1
her	1
gloves	1
on.	1
"Yes,"	1
she	1
said,	1
"I'll	1
be	1
there";	1
and	1
almost	1
instantly	1
left	1
the	1
place.	1
That	1
night	1
the	1
detective	1
and	1
the	1
priest	1
were	1
still	1
talking	1
of	1
the	1
matter	1
as	1
they	1
drew	1
near	1
the	1
Fulham	1
house,	1
a	1
tenement	1
strangely	1
mean	1
even	1
for	1
a	1
temporary	1
residence	1
of	1
the	1
Carstairs	1
family.	1
"Of	1
course	1
the	1
superficial,	1
on	1
reflection,"	1
said	1
Flambeau,	1
"would	1
think	1
first	1
of	1
this	1
Australian	1
brother	1
who's	1
been	1
in	1
trouble	1
before,	1
who's	1
come	1
back	1
so	1
suddenly	1
and	1
who's	1
just	1
the	1
man	1
to	1
have	1
shabby	1
confederates.	1
But	1
I	1
can't	1
see	1
how	1
he	1
can	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
thing	1
by	1
any	1
process	1
of	1
thought,	1
unless..."	1
"Well?"	1
asked	1
his	1
companion	1
patiently.	1
Flambeau	1
lowered	1
his	1
voice.	1
"Unless	1
the	1
girl's	1
lover	1
comes	1
in,	1
too,	1
and	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
blacker	1
villain.	1
The	1
Australian	1
chap	1
did	1
know	1
that	1
Hawker	1
wanted	1
the	1
coin.	1
But	1
I	1
can't	1
see	1
how	1
on	1
earth	1
he	1
could	1
know	1
that	1
Hawker	1
had	1
got	1
it,	1
unless	1
Hawker	1
signalled	1
to	1
him	1
or	1
his	1
representative	1
across	1
the	1
shore."	1
"That	1
is	1
true,"	1
assented	1
the	1
priest,	1
with	1
respect.	1
"Have	1
you	1
noted	1
another	1
thing?"	1
went	1
on	1
Flambeau	1
eagerly.	1
"this	1
Hawker	1
hears	1
his	1
love	1
insulted,	1
but	1
doesn't	1
strike	1
till	1
he's	1
got	1
to	1
the	1
soft	1
sand-hills,	1
where	1
he	1
can	1
be	1
victor	1
in	1
a	1
mere	1
sham-fight.	1
If	1
he'd	1
struck	1
amid	1
rocks	1
and	1
sea,	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
hurt	1
his	1
ally."	1
"That	1
is	1
true	1
again,"	1
said	1
Father	1
Brown,	1
nodding.	1
"And	1
now,	1
take	1
it	1
from	1
the	1
start.	1
It	1
lies	1
between	1
few	1
people,	1
but	1
at	1
least	1
three.	1
You	1
want	1
one	1
person	1
for	1
suicide;	1
two	1
people	1
for	1
murder;	1
but	1
at	1
least	1
three	1
people	1
for	1
blackmail"	1
"Why?"	1
asked	1
the	1
priest	1
softly.	1
"Well,	1
obviously,"	1
cried	1
his	1
friend,	1
"there	1
must	1
be	1
one	1
to	1
be	1
exposed;	1
one	1
to	1
threaten	1
exposure;	1
and	1
one	1
at	1
least	1
whom	1
exposure	1
would	1
horrify."	1
After	1
a	1
long	1
ruminant	1
pause,	1
the	1
priest	1
said:	1
"You	1
miss	1
a	1
logical	1
step.	1
Three	1
persons	1
are	1
needed	1
as	1
ideas.	1
Only	1
two	1
are	1
needed	1
as	1
agents."	1
"What	1
can	1
you	1
mean?"	1
asked	1
the	1
other.	1
"Why	1
shouldn't	1
a	1
blackmailer,"	1
asked	1
Brown,	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice,	1
"threaten	1
his	1
victim	1
with	1
himself?	1
Suppose	1
a	1
wife	1
became	1
a	1
rigid	1
teetotaller	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
frighten	1
her	1
husband	1
into	1
concealing	1
his	1
pub-frequenting,	1
and	1
then	1
wrote	1
him	1
blackmailing	1
letters	1
in	1
another	1
hand,	1
threatening	1
to	1
tell	1
his	1
wife!	1
Why	1
shouldn't	1
it	1
work?	1
Suppose	1
a	1
father	1
forbade	1
a	1
son	1
to	1
gamble	1
and	1
then,	1
following	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
good	1
disguise,	1
threatened	1
the	1
boy	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
sham	1
paternal	1
strictness!	1
Suppose--but,	1
here	1
we	1
are,	1
my	1
friend."	1
"My	1
God!"	1
cried	1
Flambeau;	1
"you	1
don't	1
mean--"	1
An	1
active	1
figure	1
ran	1
down	1
the	1
steps	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
showed	1
under	1
the	1
golden	1
lamplight	1
the	1
unmistakable	1
head	1
that	1
resembled	1
the	1
Roman	1
coin.	1
"Miss	1
Carstairs,"	1
said	1
Hawker	1
without	1
ceremony,	1
"wouldn't	1
go	1
in	1
till	1
you	1
came."	1
"Well,"	1
observed	1
Brown	1
confidently,	1
"don't	1
you	1
think	1
it's	1
the	1
best	1
thing	1
she	1
can	1
do	1
to	1
stop	1
outside--with	1
you	1
to	1
look	1
after	1
her?	1
You	1
see,	1
I	1
rather	1
guess	1
you	1
have	1
guessed	1
it	1
all	1
yourself."	1
"Yes,"	1
said	1
the	1
young	1
man,	1
in	1
an	1
undertone,	1
"I	1
guessed	1
on	1
the	1
sands	1
and	1
now	1
I	1
know;	1
that	1
was	1
why	1
I	1
let	1
him	1
fall	1
soft."	1
Taking	1
a	1
latchkey	1
from	1
the	1
girl	1
and	1
the	1
coin	1
from	1
Hawker,	1
Flambeau	1
let	1
himself	1
and	1
his	1
friend	1
into	1
the	1
empty	1
house	1
and	1
passed	1
into	1
the	1
outer	1
parlour.	1
It	1
was	1
empty	1
of	1
all	1
occupants	1
but	1
one.	1
The	1
man	1
whom	1
Father	1
Brown	1
had	1
seen	1
pass	1
the	1
tavern	1
was	1
standing	1
against	1
the	1
wall	1
as	1
if	1
at	1
bay;	1
unchanged,	1
save	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
off	1
his	1
black	1
coat	1
and	1
was	1
wearing	1
a	1
brown	1
dressing-gown.	1
"We	1
have	1
come,"	1
said	1
Father	1
Brown	1
politely,	1
"to	1
give	1
back	1
this	1
coin	1
to	1
its	1
owner."	1
And	1
he	1
handed	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
man	1
with	1
the	1
nose.	1
Flambeau's	1
eyes	1
rolled.	1
"Is	1
this	1
man	1
a	1
coin-collector?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
"This	1
man	1
is	1
Mr	1
Arthur	1
Carstairs,"	1
said	1
the	1
priest	1
positively,	1
"and	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
coin-collector	1
of	1
a	1
somewhat	1
singular	1
kind."	1
The	1
man	1
changed	1
colour	1
so	1
horribly	1
that	1
the	1
crooked	1
nose	1
stood	1
out	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
like	1
a	1
separate	1
and	1
comic	1
thing.	1
He	1
spoke,	1
nevertheless,	1
with	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
despairing	1
dignity.	1
"You	1
shall	1
see,	1
then,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"that	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
lost	1
all	1
the	1
family	1
qualities."	1
And	1
he	1
turned	1
suddenly	1
and	1
strode	1
into	1
an	1
inner	1
room,	1
slamming	1
the	1
door.	1
"Stop	1
him!"	1
shouted	1
Father	1
Brown,	1
bounding	1
and	1
half	1
falling	1
over	1
a	1
chair;	1
and,	1
after	1
a	1
wrench	1
or	1
two,	1
Flambeau	1
had	1
the	1
door	1
open.	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
too	1
late.	1
In	1
dead	1
silence	1
Flambeau	1
strode	1
across	1
and	1
telephoned	1
for	1
doctor	1
and	1
police.	1
An	1
empty	1
medicine	1
bottle	1
lay	1
on	1
the	1
floor.	1
Across	1
the	1
table	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
brown	1
dressing-gown	1
lay	1
amid	1
his	1
burst	1
and	1
gaping	1
brown-paper	1
parcels;	1
out	1
of	1
which	1
poured	1
and	1
rolled,	1
not	1
Roman,	1
but	1
very	1
modern	1
English	1
coins.	1
The	1
priest	1
held	1
up	1
the	1
bronze	1
head	1
of	1
Caesar.	1
"This,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"was	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
left	1
of	1
the	1
Carstairs	1
Collection."	1
After	1
a	1
silence	1
he	1
went	1
on,	1
with	1
more	1
than	1
common	1
gentleness:	1
"It	1
was	1
a	1
cruel	1
will	1
his	1
wicked	1
father	1
made,	1
and	1
you	1
see	1
he	1
did	1
resent	1
it	1
a	1
little.	1
He	1
hated	1
the	1
Roman	1
money	1
he	1
had,	1
and	1
grew	1
fonder	1
of	1
the	1
real	1
money	1
denied	1
him.	1
He	1
not	1
only	1
sold	1
the	1
Collection	1
bit	1
by	1
bit,	1
but	1
sank	1
bit	1
by	1
bit	1
to	1
the	1
basest	1
ways	1
of	1
making	1
money--	1
even	1
to	1
blackmailing	1
his	1
own	1
family	1
in	1
a	1
disguise.	1
He	1
blackmailed	1
his	1
brother	1
from	1
Australia	1
for	1
his	1
little	1
forgotten	1
crime	1
(that	1
is	1
why	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
cab	1
to	1
Wagga	1
Wagga	1
in	1
Putney),	1
he	1
blackmailed	1
his	1
sister	1
for	1
the	1
theft	1
he	1
alone	1
could	1
have	1
noticed.	1
And	1
that,	1
by	1
the	1
way,	1
is	1
why	1
she	1
had	1
that	1
supernatural	1
guess	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
away	1
on	1
the	1
sand-dunes.	1
Mere	1
figure	1
and	1
gait,	1
however	1
distant,	1
are	1
more	1
likely	1
to	1
remind	1
us	1
of	1
somebody	1
than	1
a	1
well-made-up	1
face	1
quite	1
close."	1
There	1
was	1
another	1
silence.	1
"Well,"	1
growled	1
the	1
detective,	1
"and	1
so	1
this	1
great	1
numismatist	1
and	1
coin-collector	1
was	1
nothing	1
but	1
a	1
vulgar	1
miser."	1
"Is	1
there	1
so	1
great	1
a	1
difference?"	1
asked	1
Father	1
Brown,	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
strange,	1
indulgent	1
tone.	1
"What	1
is	1
there	1
wrong	1
about	1
a	1
miser	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
often	1
as	1
wrong	1
about	1
a	1
collector?	1
What	1
is	1
wrong,	1
except...	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
make	1
to	1
thyself	1
any	1
graven	1
image;	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
bow	1
down	1
to	1
them	1
nor	1
serve	1
them,	1
for	1
I...but	1
we	1
must	1
go	1
and	1
see	1
how	1
the	1
poor	1
young	1
people	1
are	1
getting	1
on."	1
"I	1
think,"	1
said	1
Flambeau,	1
"that	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
everything,	1
they	1
are	1
probably	1
getting	1
on	1
very	1
well."	1
VII.	1
The	1
Purple	1
Wig	1
MR	1
EDWARD	1
NUTT,	1
the	1
industrious	1
editor	1
of	1
the	1
Daily	1
Reformer,	1
sat	1
at	1
his	1
desk,	1
opening	1
letters	1
and	1
marking	1
proofs	1
to	1
the	1
merry	1
tune	1
of	1
a	1
typewriter,	1
worked	1
by	1
a	1
vigorous	1
young	1
lady.	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
stoutish,	1
fair	1
man,	1
in	1
his	1
shirt-sleeves;	1
his	1
movements	1
were	1
resolute,	1
his	1
mouth	1
firm	1
and	1
his	1
tones	1
final;	1
but	1
his	1
round,	1
rather	1
babyish	1
blue	1
eyes	1
had	1
a	1
bewildered	1
and	1
even	1
wistful	1
look	1
that	1
rather	1
contradicted	1
all	1
this.	1
Nor	1
indeed	1
was	1
the	1
expression	1
altogether	1
misleading.	1
It	1
might	1
truly	1
be	1
said	1
of	1
him,	1
as	1
for	1
many	1
journalists	1
in	1
authority,	1
that	1
his	1
most	1
familiar	1
emotion	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
continuous	1
fear;	1
fear	1
of	1
libel	1
actions,	1
fear	1
of	1
lost	1
advertisements,	1
fear	1
of	1
misprints,	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
sack.	1
His	1
life	1
was	1
a	1
series	1
of	1
distracted	1
compromises	1
between	1
the	1
proprietor	1
of	1
the	1
paper	1
(and	1
of	1
him),	1
who	1
was	1
a	1
senile	1
soap-boiler	1
with	1
three	1
ineradicable	1
mistakes	1
in	1
his	1
mind,	1
and	1
the	1
very	1
able	1
staff	1
he	1
had	1
collected	1
to	1
run	1
the	1
paper;	1
some	1
of	1
whom	1
were	1
brilliant	1
and	1
experienced	1
men	1
and	1
(what	1
was	1
even	1
worse)	1
sincere	1
enthusiasts	1
for	1
the	1
political	1
policy	1
of	1
the	1
paper.	1
A	1
letter	1
from	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
lay	1
immediately	1
before	1
him,	1
and	1
rapid	1
and	1
resolute	1
as	1
he	1
was,	1
he	1
seemed	1
almost	1
to	1
hesitate	1
before	1
opening	1
it.	1
He	1
took	1
up	1
a	1
strip	1
of	1
proof	1
instead,	1
ran	1
down	1
it	1
with	1
a	1
blue	1
eye,	1
and	1
a	1
blue	1
pencil,	1
altered	1
the	1
word	1
"adultery"	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
"impropriety,"	1
and	1
the	1
word	1
"Jew"	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
"Alien,"	1
rang	1
a	1
bell	1
and	1
sent	1
it	1
flying	1
upstairs.	1
Then,	1
with	1
a	1
more	1
thoughtful	1
eye,	1
he	1
ripped	1
open	1
the	1
letter	1
from	1
his	1
more	1
distinguished	1
contributor,	1
which	1
bore	1
a	1
postmark	1
of	1
Devonshire,	1
and	1
read	1
as	1
follows:	1
DEAR	1
NUTT,--As	1
I	1
see	1
you're	1
working	1
Spooks	1
and	1
Dooks	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
what	1
about	1
an	1
article	1
on	1
that	1
rum	1
business	1
of	1
the	1
Eyres	1
of	1
Exmoor;	1
or	1
as	1
the	1
old	1
women	1
call	1
it	1
down	1
here,	1
the	1
Devil's	1
Ear	1
of	1
Eyre?	1
The	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
family,	1
you	1
know,	1
is	1
the	1
Duke	1
of	1
Exmoor;	1
he	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
few	1
really	1
stiff	1
old	1
Tory	1
aristocrats	1
left,	1
a	1
sound	1
old	1
crusted	1
tyrant	1
it	1
is	1
quite	1
in	1
our	1
line	1
to	1
make	1
trouble	1
about.	1
And	1
I	1
think	1
I'm	1
on	1
the	1
track	1
of	1
a	1
story	1
that	1
will	1
make	1
trouble.	1
Of	1
course	1
I	1
don't	1
believe	1
in	1
the	1
old	1
legend	1
about	1
James	1
I;	1
and	1
as	1
for	1
you,	1
you	1
don't	1
believe	1
in	1
anything,	1
not	1
even	1
in	1
journalism.	1
The	1
legend,	1
you'll	1
probably	1
remember,	1
was	1
about	1
the	1
blackest	1
business	1
in	1
English	1
history--the	1
poisoning	1
of	1
Overbury	1
by	1
that	1
witch's	1
cat	1
Frances	1
Howard,	1
and	1
the	1
quite	1
mysterious	1
terror	1
which	1
forced	1
the	1
King	1
to	1
pardon	1
the	1
murderers.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
alleged	1
witchcraft	1
mixed	1
up	1
with	1
it;	1
and	1
the	1
story	1
goes	1
that	1
a	1
man-servant	1
listening	1
at	1
the	1
keyhole	1
heard	1
the	1
truth	1
in	1
a	1
talk	1
between	1
the	1
King	1
and	1
Carr;	1
and	1
the	1
bodily	1
ear	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
heard	1
grew	1
large	1
and	1
monstrous	1
as	1
by	1
magic,	1
so	1
awful	1
was	1
the	1
secret.	1
And	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
loaded	1
with	1
lands	1
and	1
gold	1
and	1
made	1
an	1
ancestor	1
of	1
dukes,	1
the	1
elf-shaped	1
ear	1
is	1
still	1
recurrent	1
in	1
the	1
family.	1
Well,	1
you	1
don't	1
believe	1
in	1
black	1
magic;	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
did,	1
you	1
couldn't	1
use	1
it	1
for	1
copy.	1
If	1
a	1
miracle	1
happened	1
in	1
your	1
office,	1
you'd	1
have	1
to	1
hush	1
it	1
up,	1
now	1
so	1
many	1
bishops	1
are	1
agnostics.	1
But	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
point	1
The	1
point	1
is	1
that	1
there	1
really	1
is	1
something	1
queer	1
about	1
Exmoor	1
and	1
his	1
family;	1
something	1
quite	1
natural,	1
I	1
dare	1
say,	1
but	1
quite	1
abnormal.	1
And	1
the	1
Ear	1
is	1
in	1
it	1
somehow,	1
I	1
fancy;	1
either	1
a	1
symbol	1
or	1
a	1
delusion	1
or	1
disease	1
or	1
something.	1
Another	1
tradition	1
says	1
that	1
Cavaliers	1
just	1
after	1
James	1
I	1
began	1
to	1
wear	1
their	1
hair	1
long	1
only	1
to	1
cover	1
the	1
ear	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
Lord	1
Exmoor.	1
This	1
also	1
is	1
no	1
doubt	1
fanciful.	1
The	1
reason	1
I	1
point	1
it	1
out	1
to	1
you	1
is	1
this:	1
It	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
we	1
make	1
a	1
mistake	1
in	1
attacking	1
aristocracy	1
entirely	1
for	1
its	1
champagne	1
and	1
diamonds.	1
Most	1
men	1
rather	1
admire	1
the	1
nobs	1
for	1
having	1
a	1
good	1
time,	1
but	1
I	1
think	1
we	1
surrender	1
too	1
much	1
when	1
we	1
admit	1
that	1
aristocracy	1
has	1
made	1
even	1
the	1
aristocrats	1
happy.	1
I	1
suggest	1
a	1
series	1
of	1
articles	1
pointing	1
out	1
how	1
dreary,	1
how	1
inhuman,	1
how	1
downright	1
diabolist,	1
is	1
the	1
very	1
smell	1
and	1
atmosphere	1
of	1
some	1
of	1
these	1
great	1
houses.	1
There	1
are	1
plenty	1
of	1
instances;	1
but	1
you	1
couldn't	1
begin	1
with	1
a	1
better	1
one	1
than	1
the	1
Ear	1
of	1
the	1
Eyres.	1
By	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
week	1
I	1
think	1
I	1
can	1
get	1
you	1
the	1
truth	1
about	1
it.--Yours	1
ever,	1
FRANCIS	1
FINN.	1
Mr	1
Nutt	1
reflected	1
a	1
moment,	1
staring	1
at	1
his	1
left	1
boot;	1
then	1
he	1
called	1
out	1
in	1
a	1
strong,	1
loud	1
and	1
entirely	1
lifeless	1
voice,	1
in	1
which	1
every	1
syllable	1
sounded	1
alike:	1
"Miss	1
Barlow,	1
take	1
down	1
a	1
letter	1
to	1
Mr	1
Finn,	1
please."	1
DEAR	1
FINN,--I	1
think	1
it	1
would	1
do;	1
copy	1
should	1
reach	1
us	1
second	1
post	1
Saturday.--Yours,	1
E.	1
NUTT.	1
This	1
elaborate	1
epistle	1
he	1
articulated	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
all	1
one	1
word;	1
and	1
Miss	1
Barlow	1
rattled	1
it	1
down	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
all	1
one	1
word.	1
Then	1
he	1
took	1
up	1
another	1
strip	1
of	1
proof	1
and	1
a	1
blue	1
pencil,	1
and	1
altered	1
the	1
word	1
"supernatural"	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
"marvellous",	1
and	1
the	1
expression	1
"shoot	1
down"	1
to	1
the	1
expression	1
"repress".	1
In	1
such	1
happy,	1
healthful	1
activities	1
did	1
Mr	1
Nutt	1
disport	1
himself,	1
until	1
the	1
ensuing	1
Saturday	1
found	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
desk,	1
dictating	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
typist,	1
and	1
using	1
the	1
same	1
blue	1
pencil	1
on	1
the	1
first	1
instalment	1
of	1
Mr	1
Finn's	1
revelations.	1
The	1
opening	1
was	1
a	1
sound	1
piece	1
of	1
slashing	1
invective	1
about	1
the	1
evil	1
secrets	1
of	1
princes,	1
and	1
despair	1
in	1
the	1
high	1
places	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
Though	1
written	1
violently,	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
excellent	1
English;	1
but	1
the	1
editor,	1
as	1
usual,	1
had	1
given	1
to	1
somebody	1
else	1
the	1
task	1
of	1
breaking	1
it	1
up	1
into	1
sub-headings,	1
which	1
were	1
of	1
a	1
spicier	1
sort,	1
as	1
"Peeress	1
and	1
Poisons",	1
and	1
"The	1
Eerie	1
Ear",	1
"The	1
Eyres	1
in	1
their	1
Eyrie",	1
and	1
so	1
on	1
through	1
a	1
hundred	1
happy	1
changes.	1
Then	1
followed	1
the	1
legend	1
of	1
the	1
Ear,	1
amplified	1
from	1
Finn's	1
first	1
letter,	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
substance	1
of	1
his	1
later	1
discoveries,	1
as	1
follows:	1
I	1
know	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
practice	1
of	1
journalists	1
to	1
put	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
story	1
at	1
the	1
beginning	1
and	1
call	1
it	1
a	1
headline.	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
journalism	1
largely	1
consists	1
in	1
saying	1
"Lord	1
Jones	1
Dead"	1
to	1
people	1
who	1
never	1
knew	1
that	1
Lord	1
Jones	1
was	1
alive.	1
Your	1
present	1
correspondent	1
thinks	1
that	1
this,	1
like	1
many	1
other	1
journalistic	1
customs,	1
is	1
bad	1
journalism;	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
Daily	1
Reformer	1
has	1
to	1
set	1
a	1
better	1
example	1
in	1
such	1
things.	1
He	1
proposes	1
to	1
tell	1
his	1
story	1
as	1
it	1
occurred,	1
step	1
by	1
step.	1
He	1
will	1
use	1
the	1
real	1
names	1
of	1
the	1
parties,	1
who	1
in	1
most	1
cases	1
are	1
ready	1
to	1
confirm	1
his	1
testimony.	1
As	1
for	1
the	1
headlines,	1
the	1
sensational	1
proclamations--they	1
will	1
come	1
at	1
the	1
end.	1
I	1
was	1
walking	1
along	1
a	1
public	1
path	1
that	1
threads	1
through	1
a	1
private	1
Devonshire	1
orchard	1
and	1
seems	1
to	1
point	1
towards	1
Devonshire	1
cider,	1
when	1
I	1
came	1
suddenly	1
upon	1
just	1
such	1
a	1
place	1
as	1
the	1
path	1
suggested.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
long,	1
low	1
inn,	1
consisting	1
really	1
of	1
a	1
cottage	1
and	1
two	1
barns;	1
thatched	1
all	1
over	1
with	1
the	1
thatch	1
that	1
looks	1
like	1
brown	1
and	1
grey	1
hair	1
grown	1
before	1
history.	1
But	1
outside	1
the	1
door	1
was	1
a	1
sign	1
which	1
called	1
it	1
the	1
Blue	1
Dragon;	1
and	1
under	1
the	1
sign	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
long	1
rustic	1
tables	1
that	1
used	1
to	1
stand	1
outside	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
free	1
English	1
inns,	1
before	1
teetotallers	1
and	1
brewers	1
between	1
them	1
destroyed	1
freedom.	1
And	1
at	1
this	1
table	1
sat	1
three	1
gentlemen,	1
who	1
might	1
have	1
lived	1
a	1
hundred	1
years	1
ago.	1
Now	1
that	1
I	1
know	1
them	1
all	1
better,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
difficulty	1
about	1
disentangling	1
the	1
impressions;	1
but	1
just	1
then	1
they	1
looked	1
like	1
three	1
very	1
solid	1
ghosts.	1
The	1
dominant	1
figure,	1
both	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
bigger	1
in	1
all	1
three	1
dimensions,	1
and	1
because	1
he	1
sat	1
centrally	1
in	1
the	1
length	1
of	1
the	1
table,	1
facing	1
me,	1
was	1
a	1
tall,	1
fat	1
man	1
dressed	1
completely	1
in	1
black,	1
with	1
a	1
rubicund,	1
even	1
apoplectic	1
visage,	1
but	1
a	1
rather	1
bald	1
and	1
rather	1
bothered	1
brow.	1
Looking	1
at	1
him	1
again,	1
more	1
strictly,	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
exactly	1
say	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
gave	1
me	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
antiquity,	1
except	1
the	1
antique	1
cut	1
of	1
his	1
white	1
clerical	1
necktie	1
and	1
the	1
barred	1
wrinkles	1
across	1
his	1
brow.	1
It	1
was	1
even	1
less	1
easy	1
to	1
fix	1
the	1
impression	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
at	1
the	1
right	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
table,	1
who,	1
to	1
say	1
truth,	1
was	1
as	1
commonplace	1
a	1
person	1
as	1
could	1
be	1
seen	1
anywhere,	1
with	1
a	1
round,	1
brown-haired	1
head	1
and	1
a	1
round	1
snub	1
nose,	1
but	1
also	1
clad	1
in	1
clerical	1
black,	1
of	1
a	1
stricter	1
cut.	1
It	1
was	1
only	1
when	1
I	1
saw	1
his	1
broad	1
curved	1
hat	1
lying	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
beside	1
him	1
that	1
I	1
realized	1
why	1
I	1
connected	1
him	1
with	1
anything	1
ancient.	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
Roman	1
Catholic	1
priest.	1
Perhaps	1
the	1
third	1
man,	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
table,	1
had	1
really	1
more	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
it	1
than	1
the	1
rest,	1
though	1
he	1
was	1
both	1
slighter	1
in	1
physical	1
presence	1
and	1
more	1
inconsiderate	1
in	1
his	1
dress.	1
His	1
lank	1
limbs	1
were	1
clad,	1
I	1
might	1
also	1
say	1
clutched,	1
in	1
very	1
tight	1
grey	1
sleeves	1
and	1
pantaloons;	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
long,	1
sallow,	1
aquiline	1
face	1
which	1
seemed	1
somehow	1
all	1
the	1
more	1
saturnine	1
because	1
his	1
lantern	1
jaws	1
were	1
imprisoned	1
in	1
his	1
collar	1
and	1
neck-cloth	1
more	1
in	1
the	1
style	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
stock;	1
and	1
his	1
hair	1
(which	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
dark	1
brown)	1
was	1
of	1
an	1
odd	1
dim,	1
russet	1
colour	1
which,	1
in	1
conjunction	1
with	1
his	1
yellow	1
face,	1
looked	1
rather	1
purple	1
than	1
red.	1
The	1
unobtrusive	1
yet	1
unusual	1
colour	1
was	1
all	1
the	1
more	1
notable	1
because	1
his	1
hair	1
was	1
almost	1
unnaturally	1
healthy	1
and	1
curling,	1
and	1
he	1
wore	1
it	1
full.	1
But,	1
after	1
all	1
analysis,	1
I	1
incline	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
what	1
gave	1
me	1
my	1
first	1
old-fashioned	1
impression	1
was	1
simply	1
a	1
set	1
of	1
tall,	1
old-fashioned	1
wine-glasses,	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
lemons	1
and	1
two	1
churchwarden	1
pipes.	1
And	1
also,	1
perhaps,	1
the	1
old-world	1
errand	1
on	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
come.	1
Being	1
a	1
hardened	1
reporter,	1
and	1
it	1
being	1
apparently	1
a	1
public	1
inn,	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
need	1
to	1
summon	1
much	1
of	1
my	1
impudence	1
to	1
sit	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
long	1
table	1
and	1
order	1
some	1
cider.	1
The	1
big	1
man	1
in	1
black	1
seemed	1
very	1
learned,	1
especially	1
about	1
local	1
antiquities;	1
the	1
small	1
man	1
in	1
black,	1
though	1
he	1
talked	1
much	1
less,	1
surprised	1
me	1
with	1
a	1
yet	1
wider	1
culture.	1
So	1
we	1
got	1
on	1
very	1
well	1
together;	1
but	1
the	1
third	1
man,	1
the	1
old	1
gentleman	1
in	1
the	1
tight	1
pantaloons,	1
seemed	1
rather	1
distant	1
and	1
haughty,	1
until	1
I	1
slid	1
into	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
the	1
Duke	1
of	1
Exmoor	1
and	1
his	1
ancestry.	1
I	1
thought	1
the	1
subject	1
seemed	1
to	1
embarrass	1
the	1
other	1
two	1
a	1
little;	1
but	1
it	1
broke	1
the	1
spell	1
of	1
the	1
third	1
man's	1
silence	1
most	1
successfully.	1
Speaking	1
with	1
restraint	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
accent	1
of	1
a	1
highly	1
educated	1
gentleman,	1
and	1
puffing	1
at	1
intervals	1
at	1
his	1
long	1
churchwarden	1
pipe,	1
he	1
proceeded	1
to	1
tell	1
me	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
horrible	1
stories	1
I	1
have	1
ever	1
heard	1
in	1
my	1
life:	1
how	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
Eyres	1
in	1
the	1
former	1
ages	1
had	1
hanged	1
his	1
own	1
father;	1
and	1
another	1
had	1
his	1
wife	1
scourged	1
at	1
the	1
cart	1
tail	1
through	1
the	1
village;	1
and	1
another	1
had	1
set	1
fire	1
to	1
a	1
church	1
full	1
of	1
children,	1
and	1
so	1
on.	1
Some	1
of	1
the	1
tales,	1
indeed,	1
are	1
not	1
fit	1
for	1
public	1
print--,	1
such	1
as	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
the	1
Scarlet	1
Nuns,	1
the	1
abominable	1
story	1
of	1
the	1
Spotted	1
Dog,	1
or	1
the	1
thing	1
that	1
was	1
done	1
in	1
the	1
quarry.	1
And	1
all	1
this	1
red	1
roll	1
of	1
impieties	1
came	1
from	1
his	1
thin,	1
genteel	1
lips	1
rather	1
primly	1
than	1
otherwise,	1
as	1
he	1
sat	1
sipping	1
the	1
wine	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
tall,	1
thin	1
glass.	1
I	1
could	1
see	1
that	1
the	1
big	1
man	1
opposite	1
me	1
was	1
trying,	1
if	1
anything,	1
to	1
stop	1
him;	1
but	1
he	1
evidently	1
held	1
the	1
old	1
gentleman	1
in	1
considerable	1
respect,	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
venture	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
at	1
all	1
abruptly.	1
And	1
the	1
little	1
priest	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
end	1
of	1
the-table,	1
though	1
free	1
from	1
any	1
such	1
air	1
of	1
embarrassment,	1
looked	1
steadily	1
at	1
the	1
table,	1
and	1
seemed	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
the	1
recital	1
with	1
great	1
pain--as	1
well	1
as	1
he	1
might.	1
"You	1
don't	1
seem,"	1
I	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
narrator,	1
"to	1
be	1
very	1
fond	1
of	1
the	1
Exmoor	1
pedigree."	1
He	1
looked	1
at	1
me	1
a	1
moment,	1
his	1
lips	1
still	1
prim,	1
but	1
whitening	1
and	1
tightening;	1
then	1
he	1
deliberately	1
broke	1
his	1
long	1
pipe	1
and	1
glass	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
stood	1
up,	1
the	1
very	1
picture	1
of	1
a	1
perfect	1
gentleman	1
with	1
the	1
framing	1
temper	1
of	1
a	1
fiend.	1
"These	1
gentlemen,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"will	1
tell	1
you	1
whether	1
I	1
have	1
cause	1
to	1
like	1
it.	1
The	1
curse	1
of	1
the	1
Eyres	1
of	1
old	1
has	1
lain	1
heavy	1
on	1
this	1
country,	1
and	1
many	1
have	1
suffered	1
from	1
it.	1
They	1
know	1
there	1
are	1
none	1
who	1
have	1
suffered	1
from	1
it	1
as	1
I	1
have."	1
And	1
with	1
that	1
he	1
crushed	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
the	1
fallen	1
glass	1
under	1
his	1
heel,	1
and	1
strode	1
away	1
among	1
the	1
green	1
twilight	1
of	1
the	1
twinkling	1
apple-trees.	1
"That	1
is	1
an	1
extraordinary	1
old	1
gentleman,"	1
I	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
two;	1
"do	1
you	1
happen	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
the	1
Exmoor	1
family	1
has	1
done	1
to	1
him?	1
Who	1
is	1
he?"	1
The	1
big	1
man	1
in	1
black	1
was	1
staring	1
at	1
me	1
with	1
the	1
wild	1
air	1
of	1
a	1
baffled	1
bull;	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
at	1
first	1
seem	1
to	1
take	1
it	1
in.	1
Then	1
he	1
said	1
at	1
last,	1
"Don't	1
you	1
know	1
who	1
he	1
is?"	1
I	1
reaffirmed	1
my	1
ignorance,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
another	1
silence;	1
then	1
the	1
little	1
priest	1
said,	1
still	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
table,	1
"That	1
is	1
the	1
Duke	1
of	1
Exmoor."	1
Then,	1
before	1
I	1
could	1
collect	1
my	1
scattered	1
senses,	1
he	1
added	1
equally	1
quietly,	1
but	1
with	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
regularizing	1
things:	1
"My	1
friend	1
here	1
is	1
Doctor	1
Mull,	1
the	1
Duke's	1
librarian.	1
My	1
name	1
is	1
Brown."	1
"But,"	1
I	1
stammered,	1
"if	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
Duke,	1
why	1
does	1
he	1
damn	1
all	1
the	1
old	1
dukes	1
like	1
that?"	1
"He	1
seems	1
really	1
to	1
believe,"	1
answered	1
the	1
priest	1
called	1
Brown,	1
"that	1
they	1
have	1
left	1
a	1
curse	1
on	1
him."	1
Then	1
he	1
added,	1
with	1
some	1
irrelevance,	1
"That's	1
why	1
he	1
wears	1
a	1
wig."	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
few	1
moments	1
before	1
his	1
meaning	1
dawned	1
on	1
me.	1
"You	1
don't	1
mean	1
that	1
fable	1
about	1
the	1
fantastic	1
ear?"	1
I	1
demanded.	1
"I've	1
heard	1
of	1
it,	1
of	1
course,	1
but	1
surely	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
superstitious	1
yarn	1
spun	1
out	1
of	1
something	1
much	1
simpler.	1
I've	1
sometimes	1
thought	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
wild	1
version	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
mutilation	1
stories.	1
They	1
used	1
to	1
crop	1
criminals'	1
ears	1
in	1
the	1
sixteenth	1
century."	1
"I	1
hardly	1
think	1
it	1
was	1
that,"	1
answered	1
the	1
little	1
man	1
thoughtfully,	1
"but	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
outside	1
ordinary	1
science	1
or	1
natural	1
law	1
for	1
a	1
family	1
to	1
have	1
some	1
deformity	1
frequently	1
reappearing--such	1
as	1
one	1
ear	1
bigger	1
than	1
the	1
other."	1
The	1
big	1
librarian	1
had	1
buried	1
his	1
big	1
bald	1
brow	1
in	1
his	1
big	1
red	1
hands,	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
trying	1
to	1
think	1
out	1
his	1
duty.	1
"No,"	1
he	1
groaned.	1
"You	1
do	1
the	1
man	1
a	1
wrong	1
after	1
all.	1
Understand,	1
I've	1
no	1
reason	1
to	1
defend	1
him,	1
or	1
even	1
keep	1
faith	1
with	1
him.	1
He	1
has	1
been	1
a	1
tyrant	1
to	1
me	1
as	1
to	1
everybody	1
else.	1
Don't	1
fancy	1
because	1
you	1
see	1
him	1
sitting	1
here	1
that	1
he	1
isn't	1
a	1
great	1
lord	1
in	1
the	1
worst	1
sense	1
of	1
the	1
word.	1
He	1
would	1
fetch	1
a	1
man	1
a	1
mile	1
to	1
ring	1
a	1
bell	1
a	1
yard	1
off--if	1
it	1
would	1
summon	1
another	1
man	1
three	1
miles	1
to	1
fetch	1
a	1
matchbox	1
three	1
yards	1
off.	1
He	1
must	1
have	1
a	1
footman	1
to	1
carry	1
his	1
walking-stick;	1
a	1
body	1
servant	1
to	1
hold	1
up	1
his	1
opera-glasses--"	1
"But	1
not	1
a	1
valet	1
to	1
brush	1
his	1
clothes,"	1
cut	1
in	1
the	1
priest,	1
with	1
a	1
curious	1
dryness,	1
"for	1
the	1
valet	1
would	1
want	1
to	1
brush	1
his	1
wig,	1
too."	1
The	1
librarian	1
turned	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
seemed	1
to	1
forget	1
my	1
presence;	1
he	1
was	1
strongly	1
moved	1
and,	1
I	1
think,	1
a	1
little	1
heated	1
with	1
wine.	1
"I	1
don't	1
know	1
how	1
you	1
know	1
it,	1
Father	1
Brown,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"but	1
you	1
are	1
right.	1
He	1
lets	1
the	1
whole	1
world	1
do	1
everything	1
for	1
him--except	1
dress	1
him.	1
And	1
that	1
he	1
insists	1
on	1
doing	1
in	1
a	1
literal	1
solitude	1
like	1
a	1
desert.	1
Anybody	1
is	1
kicked	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
without	1
a	1
character	1
who	1
is	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
found	1
near	1
his	1
dressing-room	1
door.,	1
"He	1
seems	1
a	1
pleasant	1
old	1
party,"	1
I	1
remarked.	1
"No,"	1
replied	1
Dr	1
Mull	1
quite	1
simply;	1
"and	1
yet	1
that	1
is	1
just	1
what	1
I	1
mean	1
by	1
saying	1
you	1
are	1
unjust	1
to	1
him	1
after	1
all.	1
Gentlemen,	1
the	1
Duke	1
does	1
really	1
feel	1
the	1
bitterness	1
about	1
the	1
curse	1
that	1
he	1
uttered	1
just	1
now.	1
He	1
does,	1
with	1
sincere	1
shame	1
and	1
terror,	1
hide	1
under	1
that	1
purple	1
wig	1
something	1
he	1
thinks	1
it	1
would	1
blast	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
man	1
to	1
see.	1
I	1
know	1
it	1
is	1
so;	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
mere	1
natural	1
disfigurement,	1
like	1
a	1
criminal	1
mutilation,	1
or	1
a	1
hereditary	1
disproportion	1
in	1
the	1
features.	1
I	1
know	1
it	1
is	1
worse	1
than	1
that;	1
because	1
a	1
man	1
told	1
me	1
who	1
was	1
present	1
at	1
a	1
scene	1
that	1
no	1
man	1
could	1
invent,	1
where	1
a	1
stronger	1
man	1
than	1
any	1
of	1
us	1
tried	1
to	1
defy	1
the	1
secret,	1
and	1
was	1
scared	1
away	1
from	1
it."	1
I	1
opened	1
my	1
mouth	1
to	1
speak,	1
but	1
Mull	1
went	1
on	1
in	1
oblivion	1
of	1
me,	1
speaking	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
cavern	1
of	1
his	1
hands.	1
"I	1
don't	1
mind	1
telling	1
you,	1
Father,	1
because	1
it's	1
really	1
more	1
defending	1
the	1
poor	1
Duke	1
than	1
giving	1
him	1
away.	1
Didn't	1
you	1
ever	1
hear	1
of	1
the	1
time	1
when	1
he	1
very	1
nearly	1
lost	1
all	1
the	1
estates?"	1
The	1
priest	1
shook	1
his	1
head;	1
and	1
the	1
librarian	1
proceeded	1
to	1
tell	1
the	1
tale	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
it	1
from	1
his	1
predecessor	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
post,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
his	1
patron	1
and	1
instructor,	1
and	1
whom	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
trust	1
implicitly.	1
Up	1
to	1
a	1
certain	1
point	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
common	1
enough	1
tale	1
of	1
the	1
decline	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
family's	1
fortunes--the	1
tale	1
of	1
a	1
family	1
lawyer.	1
His	1
lawyer,	1
however,	1
had	1
the	1
sense	1
to	1
cheat	1
honestly,	1
if	1
the	1
expression	1
explains	1
itself.	1
Instead	1
of	1
using	1
funds	1
he	1
held	1
in	1
trust,	1
he	1
took	1
advantage	1
of	1
the	1
Duke's	1
carelessness	1
to	1
put	1
the	1
family	1
in	1
a	1
financial	1
hole,	1
in	1
which	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
necessary	1
for	1
the	1
Duke	1
to	1
let	1
him	1
hold	1
them	1
in	1
reality.	1
The	1
lawyer's	1
name	1
was	1
Isaac	1
Green,	1
but	1
the	1
Duke	1
always	1
called	1
him	1
Elisha;	1
presumably	1
in	1
reference	1
to	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
quite	1
bald,	1
though	1
certainly	1
not	1
more	1
than	1
thirty.	1
He	1
had	1
risen	1
very	1
rapidly,	1
but	1
from	1
very	1
dirty	1
beginnings;	1
being	1
first	1
a	1
"nark"	1
or	1
informer,	1
and	1
then	1
a	1
money-lender:	1
but	1
as	1
solicitor	1
to	1
the	1
Eyres	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
sense,	1
as	1
I	1
say,	1
to	1
keep	1
technically	1
straight	1
until	1
he	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
deal	1
the	1
final	1
blow.	1
The	1
blow	1
fell	1
at	1
dinner;	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
librarian	1
said	1
he	1
should	1
never	1
forget	1
the	1
very	1
look	1
of	1
the	1
lampshades	1
and	1
the	1
decanters,	1
as	1
the	1
little	1
lawyer,	1
with	1
a	1
steady	1
smile,	1
proposed	1
to	1
the	1
great	1
landlord	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
halve	1
the	1
estates	1
between	1
them.	1
The	1
sequel	1
certainly	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
overlooked;	1
for	1
the	1
Duke,	1
in	1
dead	1
silence,	1
smashed	1
a	1
decanter	1
on	1
the	1
man's	1
bald	1
head	1
as	1
suddenly	1
as	1
I	1
had	1
seen	1
him	1
smash	1
the	1
glass	1
that	1
day	1
in	1
the	1
orchard.	1
It	1
left	1
a	1
red	1
triangular	1
scar	1
on	1
the	1
scalp,	1
and	1
the	1
lawyer's	1
eyes	1
altered,	1
but	1
not	1
his	1
smile.	1
He	1
rose	1
tottering	1
to	1
his	1
feet,	1
and	1
struck	1
back	1
as	1
such	1
men	1
do	1
strike.	1
"I	1
am	1
glad	1
of	1
that,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"for	1
now	1
I	1
can	1
take	1
the	1
whole	1
estate.	1
The	1
law	1
will	1
give	1
it	1
to	1
me."	1
Exmoor,	1
it	1
seems,	1
was	1
white	1
as	1
ashes,	1
but	1
his	1
eyes	1
still	1
blazed.	1
"The	1
law	1
will	1
give	1
it	1
you,"	1
he	1
said;	1
"but	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
take	1
it....	1
Why	1
not?	1
Why?	1
because	1
it	1
would	1
mean	1
the	1
crack	1
of	1
doom	1
for	1
me,	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
take	1
it	1
I	1
shall	1
take	1
off	1
my	1
wig....	1
Why,	1
you	1
pitiful	1
plucked	1
fowl,	1
anyone	1
can	1
see	1
your	1
bare	1
head.	1
But	1
no	1
man	1
shall	1
see	1
mine	1
and	1
live."	1
Well,	1
you	1
may	1
say	1
what	1
you	1
like	1
and	1
make	1
it	1
mean	1
what	1
you	1
like.	1
But	1
Mull	1
swears	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
solemn	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
lawyer,	1
after	1
shaking	1
his	1
knotted	1
fists	1
in	1
the	1
air	1
for	1
an	1
instant,	1
simply	1
ran	1
from	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
never	1
reappeared	1
in	1
the	1
countryside;	1
and	1
since	1
then	1
Exmoor	1
has	1
been	1
feared	1
more	1
for	1
a	1
warlock	1
than	1
even	1
for	1
a	1
landlord	1
and	1
a	1
magistrate.	1
Now	1
Dr	1
Mull	1
told	1
his	1
story	1
with	1
rather	1
wild	1
theatrical	1
gestures,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
passion	1
I	1
think	1
at	1
least	1
partisan.	1
I	1
was	1
quite	1
conscious	1
of	1
the	1
possibility	1
that	1
the	1
whole	1
was	1
the	1
extravagance	1
of	1
an	1
old	1
braggart	1
and	1
gossip.	1
But	1
before	1
I	1
end	1
this	1
half	1
of	1
my	1
discoveries,	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
due	1
to	1
Dr	1
Mull	1
to	1
record	1
that	1
my	1
two	1
first	1
inquiries	1
have	1
confirmed	1
his	1
story.	1
I	1
learned	1
from	1
an	1
old	1
apothecary	1
in	1
the	1
village	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
bald	1
man	1
in	1
evening	1
dress,	1
giving	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Green,	1
who	1
came	1
to	1
him	1
one	1
night	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
three-cornered	1
cut	1
on	1
his	1
forehead	1
plastered.	1
And	1
I	1
learnt	1
from	1
the	1
legal	1
records	1
and	1
old	1
newspapers	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
lawsuit	1
threatened,	1
and	1
at	1
least	1
begun,	1
by	1
one	1
Green	1
against	1
the	1
Duke	1
of	1
Exmoor.	1
Mr	1
Nutt,	1
of	1
the	1
Daily	1
Reformer,	1
wrote	1
some	1
highly	1
incongruous	1
words	1
across	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
copy,	1
made	1
some	1
highly	1
mysterious	1
marks	1
down	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
called	1
to	1
Miss	1
Barlow	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
loud,	1
monotonous	1
voice:	1
"Take	1
down	1
a	1
letter	1
to	1
Mr	1
Finn."	1
DEAR	1
FINN,--Your	1
copy	1
will	1
do,	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
to	1
headline	1
it	1
a	1
bit;	1
and	1
our	1
public	1
would	1
never	1
stand	1
a	1
Romanist	1
priest	1
in	1
the	1
story--	1
you	1
must	1
keep	1
your	1
eye	1
on	1
the	1
suburbs.	1
I've	1
altered	1
him	1
to	1
Mr	1
Brown,	1
a	1
Spiritualist.	1
Yours,	1
E.	1
NUTT.	1
A	1
day	1
or	1
two	1
afterward	1
found	1
the	1
active	1
and	1
judicious	1
editor	1
examining,	1
with	1
blue	1
eyes	1
that	1
seemed	1
to	1
grow	1
rounder	1
and	1
rounder,	1
the	1
second	1
instalment	1
of	1
Mr	1
Finn's	1
tale	1
of	1
mysteries	1
in	1
high	1
life.	1
It	1
began	1
with	1
the	1
words:	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
an	1
astounding	1
discovery.	1
I	1
freely	1
confess	1
it	1
is	1
quite	1
different	1
from	1
anything	1
I	1
expected	1
to	1
discover,	1
and	1
will	1
give	1
a	1
much	1
more	1
practical	1
shock	1
to	1
the	1
public.	1
I	1
venture	1
to	1
say,	1
without	1
any	1
vanity,	1
that	1
the	1
words	1
I	1
now	1
write	1
will	1
be	1
read	1
all	1
over	1
Europe,	1
and	1
certainly	1
all	1
over	1
America	1
and	1
the	1
Colonies.	1
And	1
yet	1
I	1
heard	1
all	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
tell	1
before	1
I	1
left	1
this	1
same	1
little	1
wooden	1
table	1
in	1
this	1
same	1
little	1
wood	1
of	1
apple-trees.	1
I	1
owe	1
it	1
all	1
to	1
the	1
small	1
priest	1
Brown;	1
he	1
is	1
an	1
extraordinary	1
man.	1
The	1
big	1
librarian	1
had	1
left	1
the	1
table,	1
perhaps	1
ashamed	1
of	1
his	1
long	1
tongue,	1
perhaps	1
anxious	1
about	1
the	1
storm	1
in	1
which	1
his	1
mysterious	1
master	1
had	1
vanished:	1
anyway,	1
he	1
betook	1
himself	1
heavily	1
in	1
the	1
Duke's	1
tracks	1
through	1
the	1
trees.	1
Father	1
Brown	1
had	1
picked	1
up	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
lemons	1
and	1
was	1
eyeing	1
it	1
with	1
an	1
odd	1
pleasure.	1
"What	1
a	1
lovely	1
colour	1
a	1
lemon	1
is!"	1
he	1
said.	1
"There's	1
one	1
thing	1
I	1
don't	1
like	1
about	1
the	1
Duke's	1
wig--the	1
colour."	1
"I	1
don't	1
think	1
I	1
understand,"	1
I	1
answered.	1
"I	1
dare	1
say	1
he's	1
got	1
good	1
reason	1
to	1
cover	1
his	1
ears,	1
like	1
King	1
Midas,"	1
went	1
on	1
the	1
priest,	1
with	1
a	1
cheerful	1
simplicity	1
which	1
somehow	1
seemed	1
rather	1
flippant	1
under	1
the	1
circumstances.	1
"I	1
can	1
quite	1
understand	1
that	1
it's	1
nicer	1
to	1
cover	1
them	1
with	1
hair	1
than	1
with	1
brass	1
plates	1
or	1
leather	1
flaps.	1
But	1
if	1
he	1
wants	1
to	1
use	1
hair,	1
why	1
doesn't	1
he	1
make	1
it	1
look	1
like	1
hair?	1
There	1
never	1
was	1
hair	1
of	1
that	1
colour	1
in	1
this	1
world.	1
It	1
looks	1
more	1
like	1
a	1
sunset-cloud	1
coming	1
through	1
the	1
wood.	1
Why	1
doesn't	1
he	1
conceal	1
the	1
family	1
curse	1
better,	1
if	1
he's	1
really	1
so	1
ashamed	1
of	1
it?	1
Shall	1
I	1
tell	1
you?	1
It's	1
because	1
he	1
isn't	1
ashamed	1
of	1
it.	1
He's	1
proud	1
of	1
it"	1
"It's	1
an	1
ugly	1
wig	1
to	1
be	1
proud	1
of--and	1
an	1
ugly	1
story,"	1
I	1
said.	1
"Consider,"	1
replied	1
this	1
curious	1
little	1
man,	1
"how	1
you	1
yourself	1
really	1
feel	1
about	1
such	1
things.	1
I	1
don't	1
suggest	1
you're	1
either	1
more	1
snobbish	1
or	1
more	1
morbid	1
than	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
us:	1
but	1
don't	1
you	1
feel	1
in	1
a	1
vague	1
way	1
that	1
a	1
genuine	1
old	1
family	1
curse	1
is	1
rather	1
a	1
fine	1
thing	1
to	1
have?	1
Would	1
you	1
be	1
ashamed,	1
wouldn't	1
you	1
be	1
a	1
little	1
proud,	1
if	1
the	1
heir	1
of	1
the	1
Glamis	1
horror	1
called	1
you	1
his	1
friend?	1
or	1
if	1
Byron's	1
family	1
had	1
confided,	1
to	1
you	1
only,	1
the	1
evil	1
adventures	1
of	1
their	1
race?	1
Don't	1
be	1
too	1
hard	1
on	1
the	1
aristocrats	1
themselves	1
if	1
their	1
heads	1
are	1
as	1
weak	1
as	1
ours	1
would	1
be,	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
snobs	1
about	1
their	1
own	1
sorrows."	1
"By	1
Jove!"	1
I	1
cried;	1
"and	1
that's	1
true	1
enough.	1
My	1
own	1
mother's	1
family	1
had	1
a	1
banshee;	1
and,	1
now	1
I	1
come	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
it,	1
it	1
has	1
comforted	1
me	1
in	1
many	1
a	1
cold	1
hour."	1
"And	1
think,"	1
he	1
went	1
on,	1
"of	1
that	1
stream	1
of	1
blood	1
and	1
poison	1
that	1
spurted	1
from	1
his	1
thin	1
lips	1
the	1
instant	1
you	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
mentioned	1
his	1
ancestors.	1
Why	1
should	1
he	1
show	1
every	1
stranger	1
over	1
such	1
a	1
Chamber	1
of	1
Horrors	1
unless	1
he	1
is	1
proud	1
of	1
it?	1
He	1
doesn't	1
conceal	1
his	1
wig,	1
he	1
doesn't	1
conceal	1
his	1
blood,	1
he	1
doesn't	1
conceal	1
his	1
family	1
curse,	1
he	1
doesn't	1
conceal	1
the	1
family	1
crimes--but--"	1
The	1
little	1
man's	1
voice	1
changed	1
so	1
suddenly,	1
he	1
shut	1
his	1
hand	1
so	1
sharply,	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
so	1
rapidly	1
grew	1
rounder	1
and	1
brighter	1
like	1
a	1
waking	1
owl's,	1
that	1
it	1
had	1
all	1
the	1
abruptness	1
of	1
a	1
small	1
explosion	1
on	1
the	1
table.	1
"But,"	1
he	1
ended,	1
"he	1
does	1
really	1
conceal	1
his	1
toilet."	1
It	1
somehow	1
completed	1
the	1
thrill	1
of	1
my	1
fanciful	1
nerves	1
that	1
at	1
that	1
instant	1
the	1
Duke	1
appeared	1
again	1
silently	1
among	1
the	1
glimmering	1
trees,	1
with	1
his	1
soft	1
foot	1
and	1
sunset-hued	1
hair,	1
coming	1
round	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
in	1
company	1
with	1
his	1
librarian.	1
Before	1
he	1
came	1
within	1
earshot,	1
Father	1
Brown	1
had	1
added	1
quite	1
composedly,	1
"Why	1
does	1
he	1
really	1
hide	1
the	1
secret	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
does	1
with	1
the	1
purple	1
wig?	1
Because	1
it	1
isn't	1
the	1
sort	1
of	1
secret	1
we	1
suppose."	1
The	1
Duke	1
came	1
round	1
the	1
corner	1
and	1
resumed	1
his	1
seat	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
table	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
native	1
dignity.	1
The	1
embarrassment	1
of	1
the	1
librarian	1
left	1
him	1
hovering	1
on	1
his	1
hind	1
legs,	1
like	1
a	1
huge	1
bear.	1
The	1
Duke	1
addressed	1
the	1
priest	1
with	1
great	1
seriousness.	1
"Father	1
Brown,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"Doctor	1
Mull	1
informs	1
me	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
come	1
here	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
request.	1
I	1
no	1
longer	1
profess	1
an	1
observance	1
of	1
the	1
religion	1
of	1
my	1
fathers;	1
but	1
for	1
their	1
sakes,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
the	1
days	1
when	1
we	1
met	1
before,	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
willing	1
to	1
hear	1
you.	1
But	1
I	1
presume	1
you	1
would	1
rather	1
be	1
heard	1
in	1
private."	1
Whatever	1
I	1
retain	1
of	1
the	1
gentleman	1
made	1
me	1
stand	1
up.	1
Whatever	1
I	1
have	1
attained	1
of	1
the	1
journalist	1
made	1
me	1
stand	1
still.	1
Before	1
this	1
paralysis	1
could	1
pass,	1
the	1
priest	1
had	1
made	1
a	1
momentarily	1
detaining	1
motion.	1
"If,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"your	1
Grace	1
will	1
permit	1
me	1
my	1
real	1
petition,	1
or	1
if	1
I	1
retain	1
any	1
right	1
to	1
advise	1
you,	1
I	1
would	1
urge	1
that	1
as	1
many	1
people	1
as	1
possible	1
should	1
be	1
present.	1
All	1
over	1
this	1
country	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
hundreds,	1
even	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
faith	1
and	1
flock,	1
whose	1
imaginations	1
are	1
poisoned	1
by	1
the	1
spell	1
which	1
I	1
implore	1
you	1
to	1
break.	1
I	1
wish	1
we	1
could	1
have	1
all	1
Devonshire	1
here	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
do	1
it."	1
"To	1
see	1
me	1
do	1
what?"	1
asked	1
the	1
Duke,	1
arching	1
his	1
eyebrows.	1
"To	1
see	1
you	1
take	1
off	1
your	1
wig,"	1
said	1
Father	1
Brown.	1
The	1
Duke's	1
face	1
did	1
not	1
move;	1
but	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
petitioner	1
with	1
a	1
glassy	1
stare	1
which	1
was	1
the	1
most	1
awful	1
expression	1
I	1
have	1
ever	1
seen	1
on	1
a	1
human	1
face.	1
I	1
could	1
see	1
the	1
librarian's	1
great	1
legs	1
wavering	1
under	1
him	1
like	1
the	1
shadows	1
of	1
stems	1
in	1
a	1
pool;	1
and	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
banish	1
from	1
my	1
own	1
brain	1
the	1
fancy	1
that	1
the	1
trees	1
all	1
around	1
us	1
were	1
filling	1
softly	1
in	1
the	1
silence	1
with	1
devils	1
instead	1
of	1
birds.	1
"I	1
spare	1
you,"	1
said	1
the	1
Duke	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
of	1
inhuman	1
pity.	1
"I	1
refuse.	1
If	1
I	1
gave	1
you	1
the	1
faintest	1
hint	1
of	1
the	1
load	1
of	1
horror	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
bear	1
alone,	1
you	1
would	1
lie	1
shrieking	1
at	1
these	1
feet	1
of	1
mine	1
and	1
begging	1
to	1
know	1
no	1
more.	1
I	1
will	1
spare	1
you	1
the	1
hint.	1
You	1
shall	1
not	1
spell	1
the	1
first	1
letter	1
of	1
what	1
is	1
written	1
on	1
the	1
altar	1
of	1
the	1
Unknown	1
God."	1
"I	1
know	1
the	1
Unknown	1
God,"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
priest,	1
with	1
an	1
unconscious	1
grandeur	1
of	1
certitude	1
that	1
stood	1
up	1
like	1
a	1
granite	1
tower.	1
"I	1
know	1
his	1
name;	1
it	1
is	1
Satan.	1
The	1
true	1
God	1
was	1
made	1
flesh	1
and	1
dwelt	1
among	1
us.	1
And	1
I	1
say	1
to	1
you,	1
wherever	1
you	1
find	1
men	1
ruled	1
merely	1
by	1
mystery,	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
mystery	1
of	1
iniquity.	1
If	1
the	1
devil	1
tells	1
you	1
something	1
is	1
too	1
fearful	1
to	1
look	1
at,	1
look	1
at	1
it.	1
If	1
he	1
says	1
something	1
is	1
too	1
terrible	1
to	1
hear,	1
hear	1
it.	1
If	1
you	1
think	1
some	1
truth	1
unbearable,	1
bear	1
it.	1
I	1
entreat	1
your	1
Grace	1
to	1
end	1
this	1
nightmare	1
now	1
and	1
here	1
at	1
this	1
table."	1
"If	1
I	1
did,"	1
said	1
the	1
Duke	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice,	1
"you	1
and	1
all	1
you	1
believe,	1
and	1
all	1
by	1
which	1
alone	1
you	1
live,	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
shrivel	1
and	1
perish.	1
You	1
would	1
have	1
an	1
instant	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
great	1
Nothing	1
before	1
you	1
died."	1
"The	1
Cross	1
of	1
Christ	1
be	1
between	1
me	1
and	1
harm,"	1
said	1
Father	1
Brown.	1
"Take	1
off	1
your	1
wig."	1
I	1
was	1
leaning	1
over	1
the	1
table	1
in	1
ungovernable	1
excitement;	1
in	1
listening	1
to	1
this	1
extraordinary	1
duel	1
half	1
a	1
thought	1
had	1
come	1
into	1
my	1
head.	1
"Your	1
Grace,"	1
I	1
cried,	1
"I	1
call	1
your	1
bluff.	1
Take	1
off	1
that	1
wig	1
or	1
I	1
will	1
knock	1
it	1
off."	1
I	1
suppose	1
I	1
can	1
be	1
prosecuted	1
for	1
assault,	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
glad	1
I	1
did	1
it.	1
When	1
he	1
said,	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
voice	1
of	1
stone,	1
"I	1
refuse,"	1
I	1
simply	1
sprang	1
on	1
him.	1
For	1
three	1
long	1
instants	1
he	1
strained	1
against	1
me	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
all	1
hell	1
to	1
help	1
him;	1
but	1
I	1
forced	1
his	1
head	1
until	1
the	1
hairy	1
cap	1
fell	1
off	1
it.	1
I	1
admit	1
that,	1
whilst	1
wrestling,	1
I	1
shut	1
my	1
eyes	1
as	1
it	1
fell.	1
I	1
was	1
awakened	1
by	1
a	1
cry	1
from	1
Mull,	1
who	1
was	1
also	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
at	1
the	1
Duke's	1
side.	1
His	1
head	1
and	1
mine	1
were	1
both	1
bending	1
over	1
the	1
bald	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
wigless	1
Duke.	1
Then	1
the	1
silence	1
was	1
snapped	1
by	1
the	1
librarian	1
exclaiming:	1
"What	1
can	1
it	1
mean?	1
Why,	1
the	1
man	1
had	1
nothing	1
to	1
hide.	1
His	1
ears	1
are	1
just	1
like	1
everybody	1
else's."	1
"Yes,"	1
said	1
Father	1
Brown,	1
"that	1
is	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
hide."	1
The	1
priest	1
walked	1
straight	1
up	1
to	1
him,	1
but	1
strangely	1
enough	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
glance	1
at	1
his	1
ears.	1
He	1
stared	1
with	1
an	1
almost	1
comical	1
seriousness	1
at	1
his	1
bald	1
forehead,	1
and	1
pointed	1
to	1
a	1
three-cornered	1
cicatrice,	1
long	1
healed,	1
but	1
still	1
discernible.	1
"Mr	1
Green,	1
I	1
think."	1
he	1
said	1
politely,	1
"and	1
he	1
did	1
get	1
the	1
whole	1
estate	1
after	1
all."	1
And	1
now	1
let	1
me	1
tell	1
the	1
readers	1
of	1
the	1
Daily	1
Reformer	1
what	1
I	1
think	1
the	1
most	1
remarkable	1
thing	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
affair.	1
This	1
transformation	1
scene,	1
which	1
will	1
seem	1
to	1
you	1
as	1
wild	1
and	1
purple	1
as	1
a	1
Persian	1
fairy-tale,	1
has	1
been	1
(except	1
for	1
my	1
technical	1
assault)	1
strictly	1
legal	1
and	1
constitutional	1
from	1
its	1
first	1
beginnings.	1
This	1
man	1
with	1
the	1
odd	1
scar	1
and	1
the	1
ordinary	1
ears	1
is	1
not	1
an	1
impostor.	1
Though	1
(in	1
one	1
sense)	1
he	1
wears	1
another	1
man's	1
wig	1
and	1
claims	1
another	1
man's	1
ear,	1
he	1
has	1
not	1
stolen	1
another	1
man's	1
coronet.	1
He	1
really	1
is	1
the	1
one	1
and	1
only	1
Duke	1
of	1
Exmoor.	1
What	1
happened	1
was	1
this.	1
The	1
old	1
Duke	1
really	1
had	1
a	1
slight	1
malformation	1
of	1
the	1
ear,	1
which	1
really	1
was	1
more	1
or	1
less	1
hereditary.	1
He	1
really	1
was	1
morbid	1
about	1
it;	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
likely	1
enough	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
invoke	1
it	1
as	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
curse	1
in	1
the	1
violent	1
scene	1
(which	1
undoubtedly	1
happened)	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
struck	1
Green	1
with	1
the	1
decanter.	1
But	1
the	1
contest	1
ended	1
very	1
differently.	1
Green	1
pressed	1
his	1
claim	1
and	1
got	1
the	1
estates;	1
the	1
dispossessed	1
nobleman	1
shot	1
himself	1
and	1
died	1
without	1
issue.	1
After	1
a	1
decent	1
interval	1
the	1
beautiful	1
English	1
Government	1
revived	1
the	1
"extinct"	1
peerage	1
of	1
Exmoor,	1
and	1
bestowed	1
it,	1
as	1
is	1
usual,	1
on	1
the	1
most	1
important	1
person,	1
the	1
person	1
who	1
had	1
got	1
the	1
property.	1
This	1
man	1
used	1
the	1
old	1
feudal	1
fables--properly,	1
in	1
his	1
snobbish	1
soul,	1
really	1
envied	1
and	1
admired	1
them.	1
So	1
that	1
thousands	1
of	1
poor	1
English	1
people	1
trembled	1
before	1
a	1
mysterious	1
chieftain	1
with	1
an	1
ancient	1
destiny	1
and	1
a	1
diadem	1
of	1
evil	1
stars--when	1
they	1
are	1
really	1
trembling	1
before	1
a	1
guttersnipe	1
who	1
was	1
a	1
pettifogger	1
and	1
a	1
pawnbroker	1
not	1
twelve	1
years	1
ago.	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
very	1
typical	1
of	1
the	1
real	1
case	1
against	1
our	1
aristocracy	1
as	1
it	1
is,	1
and	1
as	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
till	1
God	1
sends	1
us	1
braver	1
men.	1
Mr	1
Nutt	1
put	1
down	1
the	1
manuscript	1
and	1
called	1
out	1
with	1
unusual	1
sharpness:	1
"Miss	1
Barlow,	1
please	1
take	1
down	1
a	1
letter	1
to	1
Mr	1
Finn."	1
DEAR	1
FINN,--You	1
must	1
be	1
mad;	1
we	1
can't	1
touch	1
this.	1
I	1
wanted	1
vampires	1
and	1
the	1
bad	1
old	1
days	1
and	1
aristocracy	1
hand-in-hand	1
with	1
superstition.	1
They	1
like	1
that	1
But	1
you	1
must	1
know	1
the	1
Exmoors	1
would	1
never	1
forgive	1
this.	1
And	1
what	1
would	1
our	1
people	1
say	1
then,	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
know!	1
Why,	1
Sir	1
Simon	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
Exmoor's	1
greatest	1
pals;	1
and	1
it	1
would	1
ruin	1
that	1
cousin	1
of	1
the	1
Eyres	1
that's	1
standing	1
for	1
us	1
at	1
Bradford.	1
Besides,	1
old	1
Soap-Suds	1
was	1
sick	1
enough	1
at	1
not	1
getting	1
his	1
peerage	1
last	1
year;	1
he'd	1
sack	1
me	1
by	1
wire	1
if	1
I	1
lost	1
him	1
it	1
with	1
such	1
lunacy	1
as	1
this.	1
And	1
what	1
about	1
Duffey?	1
He's	1
doing	1
us	1
some	1
rattling	1
articles	1
on	1
"The	1
Heel	1
of	1
the	1
Norman."	1
And	1
how	1
can	1
he	1
write	1
about	1
Normans	1
if	1
the	1
man's	1
only	1
a	1
solicitor?	1
Do	1
be	1
reasonable.--Yours,	1
E.	1
NUTT.	1
As	1
Miss	1
Barlow	1
rattled	1
away	1
cheerfully,	1
he	1
crumpled	1
up	1
the	1
copy	1
and	1
tossed	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
waste-paper	1
basket;	1
but	1
not	1
before	1
he	1
had,	1
automatically	1
and	1
by	1
force	1
of	1
habit,	1
altered	1
the	1
word	1
"God"	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
"circumstances."	1
VIII.	1
The	1
Perishing	1
of	1
the	1
Pendragons	1
FATHER	1
BROWN	1
was	1
in	1
no	1
mood	1
for	1
adventures.	1
He	1
had	1
lately	1
fallen	1
ill	1
with	1
over-work,	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
recover,	1
his	1
friend	1
Flambeau	1
had	1
taken	1
him	1
on	1
a	1
cruise	1
in	1
a	1
small	1
yacht	1
with	1
Sir	1
Cecil	1
Fanshaw,	1
a	1
young	1
Cornish	1
squire	1
and	1
an	1
enthusiast	1
for	1
Cornish	1
coast	1
scenery.	1
But	1
Brown	1
was	1
still	1
rather	1
weak;	1
he	1
was	1
no	1
very	1
happy	1
sailor;	1
and	1
though	1
he	1
was	1
never	1
of	1
the	1
sort	1
that	1
either	1
grumbles	1
or	1
breaks	1
down,	1
his	1
spirits	1
did	1
not	1
rise	1
above	1
patience	1
and	1
civility.	1
When	1
the	1
other	1
two	1
men	1
praised	1
the	1
ragged	1
violet	1
sunset	1
or	1
the	1
ragged	1
volcanic	1
crags,	1
he	1
agreed	1
with	1
them.	1
When	1
Flambeau	1
pointed	1
out	1
a	1
rock	1
shaped	1
like	1
a	1
dragon,	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
it	1
and	1
thought	1
it	1
very	1
like	1
a	1
dragon.	1
When	1
Fanshaw	1
more	1
excitedly	1
indicated	1
a	1
rock	1
that	1
was	1
like	1
Merlin,	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
it,	1
and	1
signified	1
assent.	1
When	1
Flambeau	1
asked	1
whether	1
this	1
rocky	1
gate	1
of	1
the	1
twisted	1
river	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
Fairyland,	1
he	1
said	1
"Yes."	1
He	1
heard	1
the	1
most	1
important	1
things	1
and	1
the	1
most	1
trivial	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
tasteless	1
absorption.	1
He	1
heard	1
that	1
the	1
coast	1
was	1
death	1
to	1
all	1
but	1
careful	1
seamen;	1
he	1
also	1
heard	1
that	1
the	1
ship's	1
cat	1
was	1
asleep.	1
He	1
heard	1
that	1
Fanshaw	1
couldn't	1
find	1
his	1
cigar-holder	1
anywhere;	1
he	1
also	1
heard	1
the	1
pilot	1
deliver	1
the	1
oracle	1
"Both	1
eyes	1
bright,	1
she's	1
all	1
right;	1
one	1
eye	1
winks,	1
down	1
she	1
sinks."	1
He	1
heard	1
Flambeau	1
say	1
to	1
Fanshaw	1
that	1
no	1
doubt	1
this	1
meant	1
the	1
pilot	1
must	1
keep	1
both	1
eyes	1
open	1
and	1
be	1
spry.	1
And	1
he	1
heard	1
Fanshaw	1
say	1
to	1
Flambeau	1
that,	1
oddly	1
enough,	1
it	1
didn't	1
mean	1
this:	1
it	1
meant	1
that	1
while	1
they	1
saw	1
two	1
of	1
the	1
coast	1
lights,	1
one	1
near	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
distant,	1
exactly	1
side	1
by	1
side,	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
right	1
river-channel;	1
but	1
that	1
if	1
one	1
light	1
was	1
hidden	1
behind	1
the	1
other,	1
they	1
were	1
going	1
on	1
the	1
rocks.	1
He	1
heard	1
Fanshaw	1
add	1
that	1
his	1
country	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
such	1
quaint	1
fables	1
and	1
idioms;	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
very	1
home	1
of	1
romance;	1
he	1
even	1
pitted	1
this	1
part	1
of	1
Cornwall	1
against	1
Devonshire,	1
as	1
a	1
claimant	1
to	1
the	1
laurels	1
of	1
Elizabethan	1
seamanship.	1
According	1
to	1
him	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
captains	1
among	1
these	1
coves	1
and	1
islets	1
compared	1
with	1
whom	1
Drake	1
was	1
practically	1
a	1
landsman.	1
He	1
heard	1
Flambeau	1
laugh,	1
and	1
ask	1
if,	1
perhaps,	1
the	1
adventurous	1
title	1
of	1
"Westward	1
Ho!"	1
only	1
meant	1
that	1
all	1
Devonshire	1
men	1
wished	1
they	1
were	1
living	1
in	1
Cornwall.	1
He	1
heard	1
Fanshaw	1
say	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
need	1
to	1
be	1
silly;	1
that	1
not	1
only	1
had	1
Cornish	1
captains	1
been	1
heroes,	1
but	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
heroes	1
still:	1
that	1
near	1
that	1
very	1
spot	1
there	1
was	1
an	1
old	1
admiral,	1
now	1
retired,	1
who	1
was	1
scarred	1
by	1
thrilling	1
voyages	1
full	1
of	1
adventures;	1
and	1
who	1
had	1
in	1
his	1
youth	1
found	1
the	1
last	1
group	1
of	1
eight	1
Pacific	1
Islands	1
that	1
was	1
added	1
to	1
the	1
chart	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
This	1
Cecil	1
Fanshaw	1
was,	1
in	1
person,	1
of	1
the	1
kind	1
that	1
commonly	1
urges	1
such	1
crude	1
but	1
pleasing	1
enthusiasms;	1
a	1
very	1
young	1
man,	1
light-haired,	1
high-coloured,	1
with	1
an	1
eager	1
profile;	1
with	1
a	1
boyish	1
bravado	1
of	1
spirits,	1
but	1
an	1
almost	1
girlish	1
delicacy	1
of	1
tint	1
and	1
type.	1
The	1
big	1
shoulders,	1
black	1
brows	1
and	1
black	1
mousquetaire	1
swagger	1
of	1
Flambeau	1
were	1
a	1
great	1
contrast.	1
All	1
these	1
trivialities	1
Brown	1
heard	1
and	1
saw;	1
but	1
heard	1
them	1
as	1
a	1
tired	1
man	1
hears	1
a	1
tune	1
in	1
the	1
railway	1
wheels,	1
or	1
saw	1
them	1
as	1
a	1
sick	1
man	1
sees	1
the	1
pattern	1
of	1
his	1
wall-paper.	1
No	1
one	1
can	1
calculate	1
the	1
turns	1
of	1
mood	1
in	1
convalescence:	1
but	1
Father	1
Brown's	1
depression	1
must	1
have	1
had	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
his	1
mere	1
unfamiliarity	1
with	1
the	1
sea.	1
For	1
as	1
the	1
river	1
mouth	1
narrowed	1
like	1
the	1
neck	1
of	1
a	1
bottle,	1
and	1
the	1
water	1
grew	1
calmer	1
and	1
the	1
air	1
warmer	1
and	1
more	1
earthly,	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
wake	1
up	1
and	1
take	1
notice	1
like	1
a	1
baby.	1
They	1
had	1
reached	1
that	1
phase	1
just	1
after	1
sunset	1
when	1
air	1
and	1
water	1
both	1
look	1
bright,	1
but	1
earth	1
and	1
all	1
its	1
growing	1
things	1
look	1
almost	1
black	1
by	1
comparison.	1
About	1
this	1
particular	1
evening,	1
however,	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
exceptional.	1
It	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
rare	1
atmospheres	1
in	1
which	1
a	1
smoked-glass	1
slide	1
seems	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
slid	1
away	1
from	1
between	1
us	1
and	1
Nature;	1
so	1
that	1
even	1
dark	1
colours	1
on	1
that	1
day	1
look	1
more	1
gorgeous	1
than	1
bright	1
colours	1
on	1
cloudier	1
days.	1
The	1
trampled	1
earth	1
of	1
the	1
river-banks	1
and	1
the	1
peaty	1
stain	1
in	1
the	1
pools	1
did	1
not	1
look	1
drab	1
but	1
glowing	1
umber,	1
and	1
the	1
dark	1
woods	1
astir	1
in	1
the	1
breeze	1
did	1
not	1
look,	1
as	1
usual,	1
dim	1
blue	1
with	1
mere	1
depth	1
of	1
distance,	1
but	1
more	1
like	1
wind-tumbled	1
masses	1
of	1
some	1
vivid	1
violet	1
blossom.	1
This	1
magic	1
clearness	1
and	1
intensity	1
in	1
the	1
colours	1
was	1
further	1
forced	1
on	1
Brown's	1
slowly	1
reviving	1
senses	1
by	1
something	1
romantic	1
and	1
even	1
secret	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
form	1
of	1
the	1
landscape.	1
The	1
river	1
was	1
still	1
well	1
wide	1
and	1
deep	1
enough	1
for	1
a	1
pleasure	1
boat	1
so	1
small	1
as	1
theirs;	1
but	1
the	1
curves	1
of	1
the	1
country-side	1
suggested	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
closing	1
in	1
on	1
either	1
hand;	1
the	1
woods	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
making	1
broken	1
and	1
flying	1
attempts	1
at	1
bridge-building--as	1
if	1
the	1
boat	1
were	1
passing	1
from	1
the	1
romance	1
of	1
a	1
valley	1
to	1
the	1
romance	1
of	1
a	1
hollow	1
and	1
so	1
to	1
the	1
supreme	1
romance	1
of	1
a	1
tunnel.	1
Beyond	1
this	1
mere	1
look	1
of	1
things	1
there	1
was	1
little	1
for	1
Brown's	1
freshening	1
fancy	1
to	1
feed	1
on;	1
he	1
saw	1
no	1
human	1
beings,	1
except	1
some	1
gipsies	1
trailing	1
along	1
the	1
river	1
bank,	1
with	1
faggots	1
and	1
osiers	1
cut	1
in	1
the	1
forest;	1
and	1
one	1
sight	1
no	1
longer	1
unconventional,	1
but	1
in	1
such	1
remote	1
parts	1
still	1
uncommon:	1
a	1
dark-haired	1
lady,	1
bare-headed,	1
and	1
paddling	1
her	1
own	1
canoe.	1
If	1
Father	1
Brown	1
ever	1
attached	1
any	1
importance	1
to	1
either	1
of	1
these,	1
he	1
certainly	1
forgot	1
them	1
at	1
the	1
next	1
turn	1
of	1
the	1
river	1
which	1
brought	1
in	1
sight	1
a	1
singular	1
object.	1
The	1
water	1
seemed	1
to	1
widen	1
and	1
split,	1
being	1
cloven	1
by	1
the	1
dark	1
wedge	1
of	1
a	1
fish-shaped	1
and	1
wooded	1
islet.	1
With	1
the	1
rate	1
at	1
which	1
they	1
went,	1
the	1
islet	1
seemed	1
to	1
swim	1
towards	1
them	1
like	1
a	1
ship;	1
a	1
ship	1
with	1
a	1
very	1
high	1
prow--or,	1
to	1
speak	1
more	1
strictly,	1
a	1
very	1
high	1
funnel.	1
For	1
at	1
the	1
extreme	1
point	1
nearest	1
them	1
stood	1
up	1
an	1
odd-looking	1
building,	1
unlike	1
anything	1
they	1
could	1
remember	1
or	1
connect	1
with	1
any	1
purpose.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
specially	1
high,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
too	1
high	1
for	1
its	1
breadth	1
to	1
be	1
called	1
anything	1
but	1
a	1
tower.	1
Yet	1
it	1
appeared	1
to	1
be	1
built	1
entirely	1
of	1
wood,	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
a	1
most	1
unequal	1
and	1
eccentric	1
way.	1
Some	1
of	1
the	1
planks	1
and	1
beams	1
were	1
of	1
good,	1
seasoned	1
oak;	1
some	1
of	1
such	1
wood	1
cut	1
raw	1
and	1
recent;	1
some	1
again	1
of	1
white	1
pinewood,	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
more	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
sort	1
of	1
wood	1
painted	1
black	1
with	1
tar.	1
These	1
black	1
beams	1
were	1
set	1
crooked	1
or	1
crisscross	1
at	1
all	1
kinds	1
of	1
angles,	1
giving	1
the	1
whole	1
a	1
most	1
patchy	1
and	1
puzzling	1
appearance.	1
There	1
were	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
windows,	1
which	1
appeared	1
to	1
be	1
coloured	1
and	1
leaded	1
in	1
an	1
old-fashioned	1
but	1
more	1
elaborate	1
style.	1
The	1
travellers	1
looked	1
at	1
it	1
with	1
that	1
paradoxical	1
feeling	1
we	1
have	1
when	1
something	1
reminds	1
us	1
of	1
something,	1
and	1
yet	1
we	1
are	1
certain	1
it	1
is	1
something	1
very	1
different.	1
Father	1
Brown,	1
even	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
mystified,	1
was	1
clever	1
in	1
analysing	1
his	1
own	1
mystification.	1
And	1
he	1
found	1
himself	1
reflecting	1
that	1
the	1
oddity	1
seemed	1
to	1
consist	1
in	1
a	1
particular	1
shape	1
cut	1
out	1
in	1
an	1
incongruous	1
material;	1
as	1
if	1
one	1
saw	1
a	1
top-hat	1
made	1
of	1
tin,	1
or	1
a	1
frock-coat	1
cut	1
out	1
of	1
tartan.	1
He	1
was	1
sure	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
timbers	1
of	1
different	1
tints	1
arranged	1
like	1
that	1
somewhere,	1
but	1
never	1
in	1
such	1
architectural	1
proportions.	1
The	1
next	1
moment	1
a	1
glimpse	1
through	1
the	1
dark	1
trees	1
told	1
him	1
all	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
know	1
and	1
he	1
laughed.	1
Through	1
a	1
gap	1
in	1
the	1
foliage	1
there	1
appeared	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
old	1
wooden	1
houses,	1
faced	1
with	1
black	1
beams,	1
which	1
are	1
still	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
in	1
England,	1
but	1
which	1
most	1
of	1
us	1
see	1
imitated	1
in	1
some	1
show	1
called	1
"Old	1
London"	1
or	1
"Shakespeare's	1
England'.	1
It	1
was	1
in	1
view	1
only	1
long	1
enough	1
for	1
the	1
priest	1
to	1
see	1
that,	1
however	1
old-fashioned,	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
comfortable	1
and	1
well-kept	1
country-house,	1
with	1
flower-beds	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
it.	1
It	1
had	1
none	1
of	1
the	1
piebald	1
and	1
crazy	1
look	1
of	1
the	1
tower	1
that	1
seemed	1
made	1
out	1
of	1
its	1
refuse.	1
"What	1
on	1
earth's	1
this?"	1
said	1
Flambeau,	1
who	1
was	1
still	1
staring	1
at	1
the	1
tower.	1
Fanshaw's	1
eyes	1
were	1
shining,	1
and	1
he	1
spoke	1
triumphantly.	1
"Aha!	1
you've	1
not	1
seen	1
a	1
place	1
quite	1
like	1
this	1
before,	1
I	1
fancy;	1
that's	1
why	1
I've	1
brought	1
you	1
here,	1
my	1
friend.	1
Now	1
you	1
shall	1
see	1
whether	1
I	1
exaggerate	1
about	1
the	1
mariners	1
of	1
Cornwall.	1
This	1
place	1
belongs	1
to	1
Old	1
Pendragon,	1
whom	1
we	1
call	1
the	1
Admiral;	1
though	1
he	1
retired	1
before	1
getting	1
the	1
rank.	1
The	1
spirit	1
of	1
Raleigh	1
and	1
Hawkins	1
is	1
a	1
memory	1
with	1
the	1
Devon	1
folk;	1
it's	1
a	1
modern	1
fact	1
with	1
the	1
Pendragons.	1
If	1
Queen	1
Elizabeth	1
were	1
to	1
rise	1
from	1
the	1
grave	1
and	1
come	1
up	1
this	1
river	1
in	1
a	1
gilded	1
barge,	1
she	1
would	1
be	1
received	1
by	1
the	1
Admiral	1
in	1
a	1
house	1
exactly	1
such	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
accustomed	1
to,	1
in	1
every	1
corner	1
and	1
casement,	1
in	1
every	1
panel	1
on	1
the	1
wall	1
or	1
plate	1
on	1
the	1
table.	1
And	1
she	1
would	1
find	1
an	1
English	1
Captain	1
still	1
talking	1
fiercely	1
of	1
fresh	1
lands	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
little	1
ships,	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
dined	1
with	1
Drake."	1
"She'd	1
find	1
a	1
rum	1
sort	1
of	1
thing	1
in	1
the	1
garden,"	1
said	1
Father	1
Brown,	1
"which	1
would	1
not	1
please	1
her	1
Renaissance	1
eye.	1
That	1
Elizabethan	1
domestic	1
architecture	1
is	1
charming	1
in	1
its	1
way;	1
but	1
it's	1
against	1
the	1
very	1
nature	1
of	1
it	1
to	1
break	1
out	1
into	1
turrets."	1
"And	1
yet,"	1
answered	1
Fanshaw,	1
"that's	1
the	1
most	1
romantic	1
and	1
Elizabethan	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
business.	1
It	1
was	1
built	1
by	1
the	1
Pendragons	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
days	1
of	1
the	1
Spanish	1
wars;	1
and	1
though	1
it's	1
needed	1
patching	1
and	1
even	1
rebuilding	1
for	1
another	1
reason,	1
it's	1
always	1
been	1
rebuilt	1
in	1
the	1
old	1
way.	1
The	1
story	1
goes	1
that	1
the	1
lady	1
of	1
Sir	1
Peter	1
Pendragon	1
built	1
it	1
in	1
this	1
place	1
and	1
to	1
this	1
height,	1
because	1
from	1
the	1
top	1
you	1
can	1
just	1
see	1
the	1
corner	1
where	1
vessels	1
turn	1
into	1
the	1
river	1
mouth;	1
and	1
she	1
wished	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
husband's	1
ship,	1
as	1
he	1
sailed	1
home	1
from	1
the	1
Spanish	1
Main."	1
"For	1
what	1
other	1
reason,"	1
asked	1
Father	1
Brown,	1
"do	1
you	1
mean	1
that	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
rebuilt?"	1
"Oh,	1
there's	1
a	1
strange	1
story	1
about	1
that,	1
too,"	1
said	1
the	1
young	1
squire	1
with	1
relish.	1
"You	1
are	1
really	1
in	1
a	1
land	1
of	1
strange	1
stories.	1
King	1
Arthur	1
was	1
here	1
and	1
Merlin	1
and	1
the	1
fairies	1
before	1
him.	1
The	1
story	1
goes	1
that	1
Sir	1
Peter	1
Pendragon,	1
who	1
(I	1
fear)	1
had	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
faults	1
of	1
the	1
pirates	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
virtues	1
of	1
the	1
sailor,	1
was	1
bringing	1
home	1
three	1
Spanish	1
gentlemen	1
in	1
honourable	1
captivity,	1
intending	1
to	1
escort	1
them	1
to	1
Elizabeth's	1
court.	1
But	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
flaming	1
and	1
tigerish	1
temper,	1
and	1
coming	1
to	1
high	1
words	1
with	1
one	1
of	1
them,	1
he	1
caught	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
throat	1
and	1
flung	1
him	1
by	1
accident	1
or	1
design,	1
into	1
the	1
sea.	1
A	1
second	1
Spaniard,	1
who	1
was	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
the	1
first,	1
instantly	1
drew	1
his	1
sword	1
and	1
flew	1
at	1
Pendragon,	1
and	1
after	1
a	1
short	1
but	1
furious	1
combat	1
in	1
which	1
both	1
got	1
three	1
wounds	1
in	1
as	1
many	1
minutes,	1
Pendragon	1
drove	1
his	1
blade	1
through	1
the	1
other's	1
body	1
and	1
the	1
second	1
Spaniard	1
was	1
accounted	1
for.	1
As	1
it	1
happened	1
the	1
ship	1
had	1
already	1
turned	1
into	1
the	1
river	1
mouth	1
and	1
was	1
close	1
to	1
comparatively	1
shallow	1
water.	1
The	1
third	1
Spaniard	1
sprang	1
over	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
ship,	1
struck	1
out	1
for	1
the	1
shore,	1
and	1
was	1
soon	1
near	1
enough	1
to	1
it	1
to	1
stand	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
waist	1
in	1
water.	1
And	1
turning	1
again	1
to	1
face	1
the	1
ship,	1
and	1
holding	1
up	1
both	1
arms	1
to	1
Heaven--like	1
a	1
prophet	1
calling	1
plagues	1
upon	1
a	1
wicked	1
city--	1
he	1
called	1
out	1
to	1
Pendragon	1
in	1
a	1
piercing	1
and	1
terrible	1
voice,	1
that	1
he	1
at	1
least	1
was	1
yet	1
living,	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
go	1
on	1
living,	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
live	1
for	1
ever;	1
and	1
that	1
generation	1
after	1
generation	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Pendragon	1
should	1
never	1
see	1
him	1
or	1
his,	1
but	1
should	1
know	1
by	1
very	1
certain	1
signs	1
that	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
vengeance	1
were	1
alive.	1
With	1
that	1
he	1
dived	1
under	1
the	1
wave,	1
and	1
was	1
either	1
drowned	1
or	1
swam	1
so	1
long	1
under	1
water	1
that	1
no	1
hair	1
of	1
his	1
head	1
was	1
seen	1
afterwards."	1
"There's	1
that	1
girl	1
in	1
the	1
canoe	1
again,"	1
said	1
Flambeau	1
irrelevantly,	1
for	1
good-looking	1
young	1
women	1
would	1
call	1
him	1
off	1
any	1
topic.	1
"She	1
seems	1
bothered	1
by	1
the	1
queer	1
tower	1
just	1
as	1
we	1
were."	1
Indeed,	1
the	1
black-haired	1
young	1
lady	1
was	1
letting	1
her	1
canoe	1
float	1
slowly	1
and	1
silently	1
past	1
the	1
strange	1
islet;	1
and	1
was	1
looking	1
intently	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
strange	1
tower,	1
with	1
a	1
strong	1
glow	1
of	1
curiosity	1
on	1
her	1
oval	1
and	1
olive	1
face.	1
"Never	1
mind	1
girls,"	1
said	1
Fanshaw	1
impatiently,	1
"there	1
are	1
plenty	1
of	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
but	1
not	1
many	1
things	1
like	1
the	1
Pendragon	1
Tower.	1
As	1
you	1
may	1
easily	1
suppose,	1
plenty	1
of	1
superstitions	1
and	1
scandals	1
have	1
followed	1
in	1
the	1
track	1
of	1
the	1
Spaniard's	1
curse;	1
and	1
no	1
doubt,	1
as	1
you	1
would	1
put	1
it,	1
any	1
accident	1
happening	1
to	1
this	1
Cornish	1
family	1
would	1
be	1
connected	1
with	1
it	1
by	1
rural	1
credulity.	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
perfectly	1
true	1
that	1
this	1
tower	1
has	1
been	1
burnt	1
down	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
times;	1
and	1
the	1
family	1
can't	1
be	1
called	1
lucky,	1
for	1
more	1
than	1
two,	1
I	1
think,	1
of	1
the	1
Admiral's	1
near	1
kin	1
have	1
perished	1
by	1
shipwreck;	1
and	1
one	1
at	1
least,	1
to	1
my	1
own	1
knowledge,	1
on	1
practically	1
the	1
same	1
spot	1
where	1
Sir	1
Peter	1
threw	1
the	1
Spaniard	1
overboard."	1
"What	1
a	1
pity!"	1
exclaimed	1
Flambeau.	1
"She's	1
going."	1
"When	1
did	1
your	1
friend	1
the	1
Admiral	1
tell	1
you	1
this	1
family	1
history?"	1
asked	1
Father	1
Brown,	1
as	1
the	1
girl	1
in	1
the	1
canoe	1
paddled	1
off,	1
without	1
showing	1
the	1
least	1
intention	1
of	1
extending	1
her	1
interest	1
from	1
the	1
tower	1
to	1
the	1
yacht,	1
which	1
Fanshaw	1
had	1
already	1
caused	1
to	1
lie	1
alongside	1
the	1
island.	1
"Many	1
years	1
ago,"	1
replied	1
Fanshaw;	1
"he	1
hasn't	1
been	1
to	1
sea	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
now,	1
though	1
he	1
is	1
as	1
keen	1
on	1
it	1
as	1
ever.	1
I	1
believe	1
there's	1
a	1
family	1
compact	1
or	1
something.	1
Well,	1
here's	1
the	1
landing	1
stage;	1
let's	1
come	1
ashore	1
and	1
see	1
the	1
old	1
boy."	1
They	1
followed	1
him	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
island,	1
just	1
under	1
the	1
tower,	1
and	1
Father	1
Brown,	1
whether	1
from	1
the	1
mere	1
touch	1
of	1
dry	1
land,	1
or	1
the	1
interest	1
of	1
something	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
bank	1
of	1
the	1
river	1
(which	1
he	1
stared	1
at	1
very	1
hard	1
for	1
some	1
seconds),	1
seemed	1
singularly	1
improved	1
in	1
briskness.	1
They	1
entered	1
a	1
wooded	1
avenue	1
between	1
two	1
fences	1
of	1
thin	1
greyish	1
wood,	1
such	1
as	1
often	1
enclose	1
parks	1
or	1
gardens,	1
and	1
over	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
dark	1
trees	1
tossed	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
like	1
black	1
and	1
purple	1
plumes	1
upon	1
the	1
hearse	1
of	1
a	1
giant.	1
The	1
tower,	1
as	1
they	1
left	1
it	1
behind,	1
looked	1
all	1
the	1
quainter,	1
because	1
such	1
entrances	1
are	1
usually	1
flanked	1
by	1
two	1
towers;	1
and	1
this	1
one	1
looked	1
lopsided.	1
But	1
for	1
this,	1
the	1
avenue	1
had	1
the	1
usual	1
appearance	1
of	1
the	1
entrance	1
to	1
a	1
gentleman's	1
grounds;	1
and,	1
being	1
so	1
curved	1
that	1
the	1
house	1
was	1
now	1
out	1
of	1
sight,	1
somehow	1
looked	1
a	1
much	1
larger	1
park	1
than	1
any	1
plantation	1
on	1
such	1
an	1
island	1
could	1
really	1
be.	1
Father	1
Brown	1
was,	1
perhaps,	1
a	1
little	1
fanciful	1
in	1
his	1
fatigue,	1
but	1
he	1
almost	1
thought	1
the	1
whole	1
place	1
must	1
be	1
growing	1
larger,	1
as	1
things	1
do	1
in	1
a	1
nightmare.	1
Anyhow,	1
a	1
mystical	1
monotony	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
character	1
of	1
their	1
march,	1
until	1
Fanshaw	1
suddenly	1
stopped,	1
and	1
pointed	1
to	1
something	1
sticking	1
out	1
through	1
the	1
grey	1
fence--	1
something	1
that	1
looked	1
at	1
first	1
rather	1
like	1
the	1
imprisoned	1
horn	1
of	1
some	1
beast.	1
Closer	1
observation	1
showed	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
slightly	1
curved	1
blade	1
of	1
metal	1
that	1
shone	1
faintly	1
in	1
the	1
fading	1
light.	1
Flambeau,	1
who	1
like	1
all	1
Frenchmen	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
soldier,	1
bent	1
over	1
it	1
and	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
startled	1
voice:	1
"Why,	1
it's	1
a	1
sabre!	1
I	1
believe	1
I	1
know	1
the	1
sort,	1
heavy	1
and	1
curved,	1
but	1
shorter	1
than	1
the	1
cavalry;	1
they	1
used	1
to	1
have	1
them	1
in	1
artillery	1
and	1
the--"	1
As	1
he	1
spoke	1
the	1
blade	1
plucked	1
itself	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
crack	1
it	1
had	1
made	1
and	1
came	1
down	1
again	1
with	1
a	1
more	1
ponderous	1
slash,	1
splitting	1
the	1
fissiparous	1
fence	1
to	1
the	1
bottom	1
with	1
a	1
rending	1
noise.	1
Then	1
it	1
was	1
pulled	1
out	1
again,	1
flashed	1
above	1
the	1
fence	1
some	1
feet	1
further	1
along,	1
and	1
again	1
split	1
it	1
halfway	1
down	1
with	1
the	1
first	1
stroke;	1
and	1
after	1
waggling	1
a	1
little	1
to	1
extricate	1
itself	1
(accompanied	1
with	1
curses	1
in	1
the	1
darkness)	1
split	1
it	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
ground	1
with	1
a	1
second.	1
Then	1
a	1
kick	1
of	1
devilish	1
energy	1
sent	1
the	1
whole	1
loosened	1
square	1
of	1
thin	1
wood	1
flying	1
into	1
the	1
pathway,	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
gap	1
of	1
dark	1
coppice	1
gaped	1
in	1
the	1
paling.	1
Fanshaw	1
peered	1
into	1
the	1
dark	1
opening	1
and	1
uttered	1
an	1
exclamation	1
of	1
astonishment.	1
"My	1
dear	1
Admiral!"	1
he	1
exclaimed,	1
"do	1
you--er--	1
do	1
you	1
generally	1
cut	1
out	1
a	1
new	1
front	1
door	1
whenever	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
go	1
for	1
a	1
walk?"	1
The	1
voice	1
in	1
the	1
gloom	1
swore	1
again,	1
and	1
then	1
broke	1
into	1
a	1
jolly	1
laugh.	1
"No,"	1
it	1
said;	1
"I've	1
really	1
got	1
to	1
cut	1
down	1
this	1
fence	1
somehow;	1
it's	1
spoiling	1
all	1
the	1
plants,	1
and	1
no	1
one	1
else	1
here	1
can	1
do	1
it.	1
But	1
I'll	1
only	1
carve	1
another	1
bit	1
off	1
the	1
front	1
door,	1
and	1
then	1
come	1
out	1
and	1
welcome	1
you."	1
And	1
sure	1
enough,	1
he	1
heaved	1
up	1
his	1
weapon	1
once	1
more,	1
and,	1
hacking	1
twice,	1
brought	1
down	1
another	1
and	1
similar	1
strip	1
of	1
fence,	1
making	1
the	1
opening	1
about	1
fourteen	1
feet	1
wide	1
in	1
all.	1
Then	1
through	1
this	1
larger	1
forest	1
gateway	1
he	1
came	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
evening	1
light,	1
with	1
a	1
chip	1
of	1
grey	1
wood	1
sticking	1
to	1
his	1
sword-blade.	1
He	1
momentarily	1
fulfilled	1
all	1
Fanshaw's	1
fable	1
of	1
an	1
old	1
piratical	1
Admiral;	1
though	1
the	1
details	1
seemed	1
afterwards	1
to	1
decompose	1
into	1
accidents.	1
For	1
instance,	1
he	1
wore	1
a	1
broad-brimmed	1
hat	1
as	1
protection	1
against	1
the	1
sun;	1
but	1
the	1
front	1
flap	1
of	1
it	1
was	1
turned	1
up	1
straight	1
to	1
the	1
sky,	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
corners	1
pulled	1
down	1
lower	1
than	1
the	1
ears,	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
stood	1
across	1
his	1
forehead	1
in	1
a	1
crescent	1
like	1
the	1
old	1
cocked	1
hat	1
worn	1
by	1
Nelson.	1
He	1
wore	1
an	1
ordinary	1
dark-blue	1
jacket,	1
with	1
nothing	1
special	1
about	1
the	1
buttons,	1
but	1
the	1
combination	1
of	1
it	1
with	1
white	1
linen	1
trousers	1
somehow	1
had	1
a	1
sailorish	1
look.	1
He	1
was	1
tall	1
and	1
loose,	1
and	1
walked	1
with	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
swagger,	1
which	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
sailor's	1
roll,	1
and	1
yet	1
somehow	1
suggested	1
it;	1
and	1
he	1
held	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
a	1
short	1
sabre	1
which	1
was	1
like	1
a	1
navy	1
cutlass,	1
but	1
about	1
twice	1
as	1
big.	1
Under	1
the	1
bridge	1
of	1
the	1
hat	1
his	1
eagle	1
face	1
looked	1
eager,	1
all	1
the	1
more	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
only	1
clean-shaven,	1
but	1
without	1
eyebrows.	1
It	1
seemed	1
almost	1
as	1
if	1
all	1
the	1
hair	1
had	1
come	1
off	1
his	1
face	1
from	1
his	1
thrusting	1
it	1
through	1
a	1
throng	1
of	1
elements.	1
His	1
eyes	1
were	1
prominent	1
and	1
piercing.	1
His	1
colour	1
was	1
curiously	1
attractive,	1
while	1
partly	1
tropical;	1
it	1
reminded	1
one	1
vaguely	1
of	1
a	1
blood-orange.	1
That	1
is,	1
that	1
while	1
it	1
was	1
ruddy	1
and	1
sanguine,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
yellow	1
in	1
it	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
no	1
way	1
sickly,	1
but	1
seemed	1
rather	1
to	1
glow	1
like	1
gold	1
apples	1
of	1
the	1
Hesperides--	1
Father	1
Brown	1
thought	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
a	1
figure	1
so	1
expressive	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
romances	1
about	1
the	1
countries	1
of	1
the	1
Sun.	1
When	1
Fanshaw	1
had	1
presented	1
his	1
two	1
friends	1
to	1
their	1
host	1
he	1
fell	1
again	1
into	1
a	1
tone	1
of	1
rallying	1
the	1
latter	1
about	1
his	1
wreckage	1
of	1
the	1
fence	1
and	1
his	1
apparent	1
rage	1
of	1
profanity.	1
The	1
Admiral	1
pooh-poohed	1
it	1
at	1
first	1
as	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
necessary	1
but	1
annoying	1
garden	1
work;	1
but	1
at	1
length	1
the	1
ring	1
of	1
real	1
energy	1
came	1
back	1
into	1
his	1
laughter,	1
and	1
he	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
mixture	1
of	1
impatience	1
and	1
good	1
humour:	1
"Well,	1
perhaps	1
I	1
do	1
go	1
at	1
it	1
a	1
bit	1
rabidly,	1
and	1
feel	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
pleasure	1
in	1
smashing	1
anything.	1
So	1
would	1
you	1
if	1
your	1
only	1
pleasure	1
was	1
in	1
cruising	1
about	1
to	1
find	1
some	1
new	1
Cannibal	1
Islands,	1
and	1
you	1
had	1
to	1
stick	1
on	1
this	1
muddy	1
little	1
rockery	1
in	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
rustic	1
pond.	1
When	1
I	1
remember	1
how	1
I've	1
cut	1
down	1
a	1
mile	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
of	1
green	1
poisonous	1
jungle	1
with	1
an	1
old	1
cutlass	1
half	1
as	1
sharp	1
as	1
this;	1
and	1
then	1
remember	1
I	1
must	1
stop	1
here	1
and	1
chop	1
this	1
matchwood,	1
because	1
of	1
some	1
confounded	1
old	1
bargain	1
scribbled	1
in	1
a	1
family	1
Bible,	1
why,	1
I--"	1
He	1
swung	1
up	1
the	1
heavy	1
steel	1
again;	1
and	1
this	1
time	1
sundered	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
wood	1
from	1
top	1
to	1
bottom	1
at	1
one	1
stroke.	1
"I	1
feel	1
like	1
that,"	1
he	1
said	1
laughing,	1
but	1
furiously	1
flinging	1
the	1
sword	1
some	1
yards	1
down	1
the	1
path,	1
"and	1
now	1
let's	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
house;	1
you	1
must	1
have	1
some	1
dinner."	1
The	1
semicircle	1
of	1
lawn	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
was	1
varied	1
by	1
three	1
circular	1
garden	1
beds,	1
one	1
of	1
red	1
tulips,	1
a	1
second	1
of	1
yellow	1
tulips,	1
and	1
the	1
third	1
of	1
some	1
white,	1
waxen-looking	1
blossoms	1
that	1
the	1
visitors	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
and	1
presumed	1
to	1
be	1
exotic.	1
A	1
heavy,	1
hairy	1
and	1
rather	1
sullen-looking	1
gardener	1
was	1
hanging	1
up	1
a	1
heavy	1
coil	1
of	1
garden	1
hose.	1
The	1
corners	1
of	1
the	1
expiring	1
sunset	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
cling	1
about	1
the	1
corners	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
gave	1
glimpses	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
of	1
the	1
colours	1
of	1
remoter	1
flowerbeds;	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
treeless	1
space	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
opening	1
upon	1
the	1
river	1
stood	1
a	1
tall	1
brass	1
tripod	1
on	1
which	1
was	1
tilted	1
a	1
big	1
brass	1
telescope.	1
Just	1
outside	1
the	1
steps	1
of	1
the	1
porch	1
stood	1
a	1
little	1
painted	1
green	1
garden	1
table,	1
as	1
if	1
someone	1
had	1
just	1
had	1
tea	1
there.	1
The	1
entrance	1
was	1
flanked	1
with	1
two	1
of	1
those	1
half-featured	1
lumps	1
of	1
stone	1
with	1
holes	1
for	1
eyes	1
that	1
are	1
said	1
to	1
be	1
South	1
Sea	1
idols;	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
brown	1
oak	1
beam	1
across	1
the	1
doorway	1
were	1
some	1
confused	1
carvings	1
that	1
looked	1
almost	1
as	1
barbaric.	1
As	1
they	1
passed	1
indoors,	1
the	1
little	1
cleric	1
hopped	1
suddenly	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
table,	1
and	1
standing	1
on	1
it	1
peered	1
unaffectedly	1
through	1
his	1
spectacles	1
at	1
the	1
mouldings	1
in	1
the	1
oak.	1
Admiral	1
Pendragon	1
looked	1
very	1
much	1
astonished,	1
though	1
not	1
particularly	1
annoyed;	1
while	1
Fanshaw	1
was	1
so	1
amused	1
with	1
what	1
looked	1
like	1
a	1
performing	1
pigmy	1
on	1
his	1
little	1
stand,	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
control	1
his	1
laughter.	1
But	1
Father	1
Brown	1
was	1
not	1
likely	1
to	1
notice	1
either	1
the	1
laughter	1
or	1
the	1
astonishment.	1
He	1
was	1
gazing	1
at	1
three	1
carved	1
symbols,	1
which,	1
though	1
very	1
worn	1
and	1
obscure,	1
seemed	1
still	1
to	1
convey	1
some	1
sense	1
to	1
him.	1
The	1
first	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
outline	1
of	1
some	1
tower	1
or	1
other	1
building,	1
crowned	1
with	1
what	1
looked	1
like	1
curly-pointed	1
ribbons.	1
The	1
second	1
was	1
clearer:	1
an	1
old	1
Elizabethan	1
galley	1
with	1
decorative	1
waves	1
beneath	1
it,	1
but	1
interrupted	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
by	1
a	1
curious	1
jagged	1
rock,	1
which	1
was	1
either	1
a	1
fault	1
in	1
the	1
wood	1
or	1
some	1
conventional	1
representation	1
of	1
the	1
water	1
coming	1
in.	1
The	1
third	1
represented	1
the	1
upper	1
half	1
of	1
a	1
human	1
figure,	1
ending	1
in	1
an	1
escalloped	1
line	1
like	1
the	1
waves;	1
the	1
face	1
was	1
rubbed	1
and	1
featureless,	1
and	1
both	1
arms	1
were	1
held	1
very	1
stiffly	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
air.	1
"Well,"	1
muttered	1
Father	1
Brown,	1
blinking,	1
"here	1
is	1
the	1
legend	1
of	1
the	1
Spaniard	1
plain	1
enough.	1
Here	1
he	1
is	1
holding	1
up	1
his	1
arms	1
and	1
cursing	1
in	1
the	1
sea;	1
and	1
here	1
are	1
the	1
two	1
curses:	1
the	1
wrecked	1
ship	1
and	1
the	1
burning	1
of	1
Pendragon	1
Tower."	1
Pendragon	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
with	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
venerable	1
amusement.	1
"And	1
how	1
many	1
other	1
things	1
might	1
it	1
not	1
be?"	1
he	1
said.	1
"Don't	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
that	1
sort	1
of	1
half-man,	1
like	1
a	1
half-lion	1
or	1
half-stag,	1
is	1
quite	1
common	1
in	1
heraldry?	1
Might	1
not	1
that	1
line	1
through	1
the	1
ship	1
be	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
parti-per-pale	1
lines,	1
indented,	1
I	1
think	1
they	1
call	1
it?	1
And	1
though	1
the	1
third	1
thing	1
isn't	1
so	1
very	1
heraldic,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
more	1
heraldic	1
to	1
suppose	1
it	1
a	1
tower	1
crowned	1
with	1
laurel	1
than	1
with	1
fire;	1
and	1
it	1
looks	1
just	1
as	1
like	1
it."	1
"But	1
it	1
seems	1
rather	1
odd,"	1
said	1
Flambeau,	1
"that	1
it	1
should	1
exactly	1
confirm	1
the	1
old	1
legend."	1
"Ah,"	1
replied	1
the	1
sceptical	1
traveller,	1
"but	1
you	1
don't	1
know	1
how	1
much	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
legend	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
made	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
old	1
figures.	1
Besides,	1
it	1
isn't	1
the	1
only	1
old	1
legend.	1
Fanshaw,	1
here,	1
who	1
is	1
fond	1
of	1
such	1
things,	1
will	1
tell	1
you	1
there	1
are	1
other	1
versions	1
of	1
the	1
tale,	1
and	1
much	1
more	1
horrible	1
ones.	1
One	1
story	1
credits	1
my	1
unfortunate	1
ancestor	1
with	1
having	1
had	1
the	1
Spaniard	1
cut	1
in	1
two;	1
and	1
that	1
will	1
fit	1
the	1
pretty	1
picture	1
also.	1
Another	1
obligingly	1
credits	1
our	1
family	1
with	1
the	1
possession	1
of	1
a	1
tower	1
full	1
of	1
snakes	1
and	1
explains	1
those	1
little,	1
wriggly	1
things	1
in	1
that	1
way.	1
And	1
a	1
third	1
theory	1
supposes	1
the	1
crooked	1
line	1
on	1
the	1
ship	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
conventionalized	1
thunderbolt;	1
but	1
that	1
alone,	1
if	1
seriously	1
examined,	1
would	1
show	1
what	1
a	1
very	1
little	1
way	1
these	1
unhappy	1
coincidences	1
really	1
go."	1
"Why,	1
how	1
do	1
you	1
mean?"	1
asked	1
Fanshaw.	1
"It	1
so	1
happens,"	1
replied	1
his	1
host	1
coolly,	1
"that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
thunder	1
and	1
lightning	1
at	1
all	1
in	1
the	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
shipwrecks	1
I	1
know	1
of	1
in	1
our	1
family."	1
"Oh!"	1
said	1
Father	1
Brown,	1
and	1
jumped	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
little	1
table.	1
There	1
was	1
another	1
silence	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
heard	1
the	1
continuous	1
murmur	1
of	1
the	1
river;	1
then	1
Fanshaw	1
said,	1
in	1
a	1
doubtful	1
and	1
perhaps	1
disappointed	1
tone:	1
"Then	1
you	1
don't	1
think	1
there	1
is	1
anything	1
in	1
the	1
tales	1
of	1
the	1
tower	1
in	1
flames?"	1
"There	1
are	1
the	1
tales,	1
of	1
course,"	1
said	1
the	1
Admiral,	1
shrugging	1
his	1
shoulders;	1
"and	1
some	1
of	1
them,	1
I	1
don't	1
deny,	1
on	1
evidence	1
as	1
decent	1
as	1
one	1
ever	1
gets	1
for	1
such	1
things.	1
Someone	1
saw	1
a	1
blaze	1
hereabout,	1
don't	1
you	1
know,	1
as	1
he	1
walked	1
home	1
through	1
a	1
wood;	1
someone	1
keeping	1
sheep	1
on	1
the	1
uplands	1
inland	1
thought	1
he	1
saw	1
a	1
flame	1
hovering	1
over	1
Pendragon	1
Tower.	1
Well,	1
a	1
damp	1
dab	1
of	1
mud	1
like	1
this	1
confounded	1
island	1
seems	1
the	1
last	1
place	1
where	1
one	1
would	1
think	1
of	1
fires."	1
"What	1
is	1
that	1
fire	1
over	1
there?"	1
asked	1
Father	1
Brown	1
with	1
a	1
gentle	1
suddenness,	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
woods	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
river-bank.	1
They	1
were	1
all	1
thrown	1
a	1
little	1
off	1
their	1
balance,	1
and	1
the	1
more	1
fanciful	1
Fanshaw	1
had	1
even	1
some	1
difficulty	1
in	1
recovering	1
his,	1
as	1
they	1
saw	1
a	1
long,	1
thin	1
stream	1
of	1
blue	1
smoke	1
ascending	1
silently	1
into	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
evening	1
light.	1
Then	1
Pendragon	1
broke	1
into	1
a	1
scornful	1
laugh	1
again.	1
"Gipsies!"	1
he	1
said;	1
"they've	1
been	1
camping	1
about	1
here	1
for	1
about	1
a	1
week.	1
Gentlemen,	1
you	1
want	1
your	1
dinner,"	1
and	1
he	1
turned	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
enter	1
the	1
house.	1
But	1
the	1
antiquarian	1
superstition	1
in	1
Fanshaw	1
was	1
still	1
quivering,	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
hastily:	1
"But,	1
Admiral,	1
what's	1
that	1
hissing	1
noise	1
quite	1
near	1
the	1
island?	1
It's	1
very	1
like	1
fire."	1
"It's	1
more	1
like	1
what	1
it	1
is,"	1
said	1
the	1
Admiral,	1
laughing	1
as	1
he	1
led	1
the	1
way;	1
"it's	1
only	1
some	1
canoe	1
going	1
by."	1
Almost	1
as	1
he	1
spoke,	1
the	1
butler,	1
a	1
lean	1
man	1
in	1
black,	1
with	1
very	1
black	1
hair	1
and	1
a	1
very	1
long,	1
yellow	1
face,	1
appeared	1
in	1
the	1
doorway	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
dinner	1
was	1
served.	1
The	1
dining-room	1
was	1
as	1
nautical	1
as	1
the	1
cabin	1
of	1
a	1
ship;	1
but	1
its	1
note	1
was	1
rather	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
modern	1
than	1
the	1
Elizabethan	1
captain.	1
There	1
were,	1
indeed,	1
three	1
antiquated	1
cutlasses	1
in	1
a	1
trophy	1
over	1
the	1
fireplace,	1
and	1
one	1
brown	1
sixteenth-century	1
map	1
with	1
Tritons	1
and	1
little	1
ships	1
dotted	1
about	1
a	1
curly	1
sea.	1
But	1
such	1
things	1
were	1
less	1
prominent	1
on	1
the	1
white	1
panelling	1
than	1
some	1
cases	1
of	1
quaint-coloured	1
South	1
American	1
birds,	1
very	1
scientifically	1
stuffed,	1
fantastic	1
shells	1
from	1
the	1
Pacific,	1
and	1
several	1
instruments	1
so	1
rude	1
and	1
queer	1
in	1
shape	1
that	1
savages	1
might	1
have	1
used	1
them	1
either	1
to	1
kill	1
their	1
enemies	1
or	1
to	1
cook	1
them.	1
But	1
the	1
alien	1
colour	1
culminated	1
in	1
the	1
fact	1
that,	1
besides	1
the	1
butler,	1
the	1
Admiral's	1
only	1
servants	1
were	1
two	1
negroes,	1
somewhat	1
quaintly	1
clad	1
in	1
tight	1
uniforms	1
of	1
yellow.	1
The	1
priest's	1
instinctive	1
trick	1
of	1
analysing	1
his	1
own	1
impressions	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
the	1
colour	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
neat	1
coat-tails	1
of	1
these	1
bipeds	1
had	1
suggested	1
the	1
word	1
"Canary,"	1
and	1
so	1
by	1
a	1
mere	1
pun	1
connected	1
them	1
with	1
southward	1
travel.	1
Towards	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
dinner	1
they	1
took	1
their	1
yellow	1
clothes	1
and	1
black	1
faces	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room,	1
leaving	1
only	1
the	1
black	1
clothes	1
and	1
yellow	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
butler.	1
"I'm	1
rather	1
sorry	1
you	1
take	1
this	1
so	1
lightly,"	1
said	1
Fanshaw	1
to	1
the	1
host;	1
"for	1
the	1
truth	1
is,	1
I've	1
brought	1
these	1
friends	1
of	1
mine	1
with	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
their	1
helping	1
you,	1
as	1
they	1
know	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
of	1
these	1
things.	1
Don't	1
you	1
really	1
believe	1
in	1
the	1
family	1
story	1
at	1
all?"	1
"I	1
don't	1
believe	1
in	1
anything,"	1
answered	1
Pendragon	1
very	1
briskly,	1
with	1
a	1
bright	1
eye	1
cocked	1
at	1
a	1
red	1
tropical	1
bird.	1
"I'm	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
science."	1
Rather	1
to	1
Flambeau's	1
surprise,	1
his	1
clerical	1
friend,	1
who	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
entirely	1
woken	1
up,	1
took	1
up	1
the	1
digression	1
and	1
talked	1
natural	1
history	1
with	1
his	1
host	1
with	1
a	1
flow	1
of	1
words	1
and	1
much	1
unexpected	1
information,	1
until	1
the	1
dessert	1
and	1
decanters	1
were	1
set	1
down	1
and	1
the	1
last	1
of	1
the	1
servants	1
vanished.	1
Then	1
he	1
said,	1
without	1
altering	1
his	1
tone.	1
"Please	1
don't	1
think	1
me	1
impertinent,	1
Admiral	1
Pendragon.	1
I	1
don't	1
ask	1
for	1
curiosity,	1
but	1
really	1
for	1
my	1
guidance	1
and	1
your	1
convenience.	1
Have	1
I	1
made	1
a	1
bad	1
shot	1
if	1
I	1
guess	1
you	1
don't	1
want	1
these	1
old	1
things	1
talked	1
of	1
before	1
your	1
butler?"	1
The	1
Admiral	1
lifted	1
the	1
hairless	1
arches	1
over	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
exclaimed:	1
"Well,	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
where	1
you	1
got	1
it,	1
but	1
the	1
truth	1
is	1
I	1
can't	1
stand	1
the	1
fellow,	1
though	1
I've	1
no	1
excuse	1
for	1
discharging	1
a	1
family	1
servant.	1
Fanshaw,	1
with	1
his	1
fairy	1
tales,	1
would	1
say	1
my	1
blood	1
moved	1
against	1
men	1
with	1
that	1
black,	1
Spanish-looking	1
hair."	1
Flambeau	1
struck	1
the	1
table	1
with	1
his	1
heavy	1
fist.	1
"By	1
Jove!"	1
he	1
cried;	1
"and	1
so	1
had	1
that	1
girl!"	1
"I	1
hope	1
it'll	1
all	1
end	1
tonight,"	1
continued	1
the	1
Admiral,	1
"when	1
my	1
nephew	1
comes	1
back	1
safe	1
from	1
his	1
ship.	1
You	1
looked	1
surprised.	1
You	1
won't	1
understand,	1
I	1
suppose,	1
unless	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
the	1
story.	1
You	1
see,	1
my	1
father	1
had	1
two	1
sons;	1
I	1
remained	1
a	1
bachelor,	1
but	1
my	1
elder	1
brother	1
married,	1
and	1
had	1
a	1
son	1
who	1
became	1
a	1
sailor	1
like	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
us,	1
and	1
will	1
inherit	1
the	1
proper	1
estate.	1
Well,	1
my	1
father	1
was	1
a	1
strange	1
man;	1
he	1
somehow	1
combined	1
Fanshaw's	1
superstition	1
with	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
of	1
my	1
scepticism--they	1
were	1
always	1
fighting	1
in	1
him;	1
and	1
after	1
my	1
first	1
voyages,	1
he	1
developed	1
a	1
notion	1
which	1
he	1
thought	1
somehow	1
would	1
settle	1
finally	1
whether	1
the	1
curse	1
was	1
truth	1
or	1
trash.	1
If	1
all	1
the	1
Pendragons	1
sailed	1
about	1
anyhow,	1
he	1
thought	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
too	1
much	1
chance	1
of	1
natural	1
catastrophes	1
to	1
prove	1
anything.	1
But	1
if	1
we	1
went	1
to	1
sea	1
one	1
at	1
a	1
time	1
in	1
strict	1
order	1
of	1
succession	1
to	1
the	1
property,	1
he	1
thought	1
it	1
might	1
show	1
whether	1
any	1
connected	1
fate	1
followed	1
the	1
family	1
as	1
a	1
family.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
silly	1
notion,	1
I	1
think,	1
and	1
I	1
quarrelled	1
with	1
my	1
father	1
pretty	1
heartily;	1
for	1
I	1
was	1
an	1
ambitious	1
man	1
and	1
was	1
left	1
to	1
the	1
last,	1
coming,	1
by	1
succession,	1
after	1
my	1
own	1
nephew."	1
"And	1
your	1
father	1
and	1
brother,"	1
said	1
the	1
priest,	1
very	1
gently,	1
"died	1
at	1
sea,	1
I	1
fear."	1
"Yes,"	1
groaned	1
the	1
Admiral;	1
"by	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
brutal	1
accidents	1
on	1
which	1
are	1
built	1
all	1
the	1
lying	1
mythologies	1
of	1
mankind,	1
they	1
were	1
both	1
shipwrecked.	1
My	1
father,	1
coming	1
up	1
this	1
coast	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
Atlantic,	1
was	1
washed	1
up	1
on	1
these	1
Cornish	1
rocks.	1
My	1
brother's	1
ship	1
was	1
sunk,	1
no	1
one	1
knows	1
where,	1
on	1
the	1
voyage	1
home	1
from	1
Tasmania.	1
His	1
body	1
was	1
never	1
found.	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
it	1
was	1
from	1
perfectly	1
natural	1
mishap;	1
lots	1
of	1
other	1
people	1
besides	1
Pendragons	1
were	1
drowned;	1
and	1
both	1
disasters	1
are	1
discussed	1
in	1
a	1
normal	1
way	1
by	1
navigators.	1
But,	1
of	1
course,	1
it	1
set	1
this	1
forest	1
of	1
superstition	1
on	1
fire;	1
and	1
men	1
saw	1
the	1
flaming	1
tower	1
everywhere.	1
That's	1
why	1
I	1
say	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
all	1
right	1
when	1
Walter	1
returns.	1
The	1
girl	1
he's	1
engaged	1
to	1
was	1
coming	1
today;	1
but	1
I	1
was	1
so	1
afraid	1
of	1
some	1
chance	1
delay	1
frightening	1
her	1
that	1
I	1
wired	1
her	1
not	1
to	1
come	1
till	1
she	1
heard	1
from	1
me.	1
But	1
he's	1
practically	1
sure	1
to	1
be	1
here	1
some	1
time	1
tonight,	1
and	1
then	1
it'll	1
all	1
end	1
in	1
smoke--	1
tobacco	1
smoke.	1
We'll	1
crack	1
that	1
old	1
lie	1
when	1
we	1
crack	1
a	1
bottle	1
of	1
this	1
wine."	1
"Very	1
good	1
wine,"	1
said	1
Father	1
Brown,	1
gravely	1
lifting	1
his	1
glass,	1
"but,	1
as	1
you	1
see,	1
a	1
very	1
bad	1
wine-bibber.	1
I	1
most	1
sincerely	1
beg	1
your	1
pardon":	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
spilt	1
a	1
small	1
spot	1
of	1
wine	1
on	1
the	1
table-cloth.	1
He	1
drank	1
and	1
put	1
down	1
the	1
glass	1
with	1
a	1
composed	1
face;	1
but	1
his	1
hand	1
had	1
started	1
at	1
the	1
exact	1
moment	1
when	1
he	1
became	1
conscious	1
of	1
a	1
face	1
looking	1
in	1
through	1
the	1
garden	1
window	1
just	1
behind	1
the	1
Admiral--	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
a	1
woman,	1
swarthy,	1
with	1
southern	1
hair	1
and	1
eyes,	1
and	1
young,	1
but	1
like	1
a	1
mask	1
of	1
tragedy.	1
After	1
a	1
pause	1
the	1
priest	1
spoke	1
again	1
in	1
his	1
mild	1
manner.	1
"Admiral,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"will	1
you	1
do	1
me	1
a	1
favour?	1
Let	1
me,	1
and	1
my	1
friends	1
if	1
they	1
like,	1
stop	1
in	1
that	1
tower	1
of	1
yours	1
just	1
for	1
tonight?	1
Do	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
in	1
my	1
business	1
you're	1
an	1
exorcist	1
almost	1
before	1
anything	1
else?"	1
Pendragon	1
sprang	1
to	1
his	1
feet	1
and	1
paced	1
swiftly	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
across	1
the	1
window,	1
from	1
which	1
the	1
face	1
had	1
instantly	1
vanished.	1
"I	1
tell	1
you	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
in	1
it,"	1
he	1
cried,	1
with	1
ringing	1
violence.	1
"There	1
is	1
one	1
thing	1
I	1
know	1
about	1
this	1
matter.	1
You	1
may	1
call	1
me	1
an	1
atheist.	1
I	1
am	1
an	1
atheist."	1
Here	1
he	1
swung	1
round	1
and	1
fixed	1
Father	1
Brown	1
with	1
a	1
face	1
of	1
frightful	1
concentration.	1
"This	1
business	1
is	1
perfectly	1
natural.	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
curse	1
in	1
it	1
at	1
all."	1
Father	1
Brown	1
smiled.	1
"In	1
that	1
case,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"there	1
can't	1
be	1
any	1
objection	1
to	1
my	1
sleeping	1
in	1
your	1
delightful	1
summer-house."	1
"The	1
idea	1
is	1
utterly	1
ridiculous,"	1
replied	1
the	1
Admiral,	1
beating	1
a	1
tattoo	1
on	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
his	1
chair.	1
"Please	1
forgive	1
me	1
for	1
everything,"	1
said	1
Brown	1
in	1
his	1
most	1
sympathetic	1
tone,	1
"including	1
spilling	1
the	1
wine.	1
But	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
quite	1
so	1
easy	1
about	1
the	1
flaming	1
tower	1
as	1
you	1
try	1
to	1
be."	1
Admiral	1
Pendragon	1
sat	1
down	1
again	1
as	1
abruptly	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
risen;	1
but	1
he	1
sat	1
quite	1
still,	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
spoke	1
again	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
lower	1
voice.	1
"You	1
do	1
it	1
at	1
your	1
own	1
peril,"	1
he	1
said;	1
"but	1
wouldn't	1
you	1
be	1
an	1
atheist	1
to	1
keep	1
sane	1
in	1
all	1
this	1
devilry?"	1
Some	1
three	1
hours	1
afterwards	1
Fanshaw,	1
Flambeau	1
and	1
the	1
priest	1
were	1
still	1
dawdling	1
about	1
the	1
garden	1
in	1
the	1
dark;	1
and	1
it	1
began	1
to	1
dawn	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
two	1
that	1
Father	1
Brown	1
had	1
no	1
intention	1
of	1
going	1
to	1
bed	1
either	1
in	1
the	1
tower	1
or	1
the	1
house.	1
"I	1
think	1
the	1
lawn	1
wants	1
weeding,"	1
said	1
he	1
dreamily.	1
"If	1
I	1
could	1
find	1
a	1
spud	1
or	1
something	1
I'd	1
do	1
it	1
myself."	1
They	1
followed	1
him,	1
laughing	1
and	1
half	1
remonstrating;	1
but	1
he	1
replied	1
with	1
the	1
utmost	1
solemnity,	1
explaining	1
to	1
them,	1
in	1
a	1
maddening	1
little	1
sermon,	1
that	1
one	1
can	1
always	1
find	1
some	1
small	1
occupation	1
that	1
is	1
helpful	1
to	1
others.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
find	1
a	1
spud;	1
but	1
he	1
found	1
an	1
old	1
broom	1
made	1
of	1
twigs,	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
began	1
energetically	1
to	1
brush	1
the	1
fallen	1
leaves	1
off	1
the	1
grass.	1
"Always	1
some	1
little	1
thing	1
to	1
be	1
done,"	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
idiotic	1
cheerfulness;	1
"as	1
George	1
Herbert	1
says:	1
`Who	1
sweeps	1
an	1
Admiral's	1
garden	1
in	1
Cornwall	1
as	1
for	1
Thy	1
laws	1
makes	1
that	1
and	1
the	1
action	1
fine.'	1
And	1
now,"	1
he	1
added,	1
suddenly	1
slinging	1
the	1
broom	1
away,	1
"Let's	1
go	1
and	1
water	1
the	1
flowers."	1
With	1
the	1
same	1
mixed	1
emotions	1
they	1
watched	1
him	1
uncoil	1
some	1
considerable	1
lengths	1
of	1
the	1
large	1
garden	1
hose,	1
saying	1
with	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
wistful	1
discrimination:	1
"The	1
red	1
tulips	1
before	1
the	1
yellow,	1
I	1
think.	1
Look	1
a	1
bit	1
dry,	1
don't	1
you	1
think?"	1
He	1
turned	1
the	1
little	1
tap	1
on	1
the	1
instrument,	1
and	1
the	1
water	1
shot	1
out	1
straight	1
and	1
solid	1
as	1
a	1
long	1
rod	1
of	1
steel.	1
"Look	1
out,	1
Samson,"	1
cried	1
Flambeau;	1
"why,	1
you've	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
tulip's	1
head."	1
Father	1
Brown	1
stood	1
ruefully	1
contemplating	1
the	1
decapitated	1
plant.	1
"Mine	1
does	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
rather	1
kill	1
or	1
cure	1
sort	1
of	1
watering,"	1
he	1
admitted,	1
scratching	1
his	1
head.	1
"I	1
suppose	1
it's	1
a	1
pity	1
I	1
didn't	1
find	1
the	1
spud.	1
You	1
should	1
have	1
seen	1
me	1
with	1
the	1
spud!	1
Talking	1
of	1
tools,	1
you've	1
got	1
that	1
swordstick,	1
Flambeau,	1
you	1
always	1
carry?	1
That's	1
right;	1
and	1
Sir	1
Cecil	1
could	1
have	1
that	1
sword	1
the	1
Admiral	1
threw	1
away	1
by	1
the	1
fence	1
here.	1
How	1
grey	1
everything	1
looks!"	1
"The	1
mist's	1
rising	1
from	1
the	1
river,"	1
said	1
the	1
staring	1
Flambeau.	1
Almost	1
as	1
he	1
spoke	1
the	1
huge	1
figure	1
of	1
the	1
hairy	1
gardener	1
appeared	1
on	1
a	1
higher	1
ridge	1
of	1
the	1
trenched	1
and	1
terraced	1
lawn,	1
hailing	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
brandished	1
rake	1
and	1
a	1
horribly	1
bellowing	1
voice.	1
"Put	1
down	1
that	1
hose,"	1
he	1
shouted;	1
"put	1
down	1
that	1
hose	1
and	1
go	1
to	1
your--"	1
"I	1
am	1
fearfully	1
clumsy,"	1
replied	1
the	1
reverend	1
gentleman	1
weakly;	1
"do	1
you	1
know,	1
I	1
upset	1
some	1
wine	1
at	1
dinner."	1
He	1
made	1
a	1
wavering	1
half-turn	1
of	1
apology	1
towards	1
the	1
gardener,	1
with	1
the	1
hose	1
still	1
spouting	1
in	1
his	1
hand.	1
The	1
gardener	1
caught	1
the	1
cold	1
crash	1
of	1
the	1
water	1
full	1
in	1
his	1
face	1
like	1
the	1
crash	1
of	1
a	1
cannon-ball;	1
staggered,	1
slipped	1
and	1
went	1
sprawling	1
with	1
his	1
boots	1
in	1
the	1
air.	1
"How	1
very	1
dreadful!"	1
said	1
Father	1
Brown,	1
looking	1
round	1
in	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
wonder.	1
"Why,	1
I've	1
hit	1
a	1
man!"	1
He	1
stood	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
forward	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
as	1
if	1
looking	1
or	1
listening;	1
and	1
then	1
set	1
off	1
at	1
a	1
trot	1
towards	1
the	1
tower,	1
still	1
trailing	1
the	1
hose	1
behind	1
him.	1
The	1
tower	1
was	1
quite	1
close,	1
but	1
its	1
outline	1
was	1
curiously	1
dim.	1
"Your	1
river	1
mist,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"has	1
a	1
rum	1
smell."	1
"By	1
the	1
Lord	1
it	1
has,"	1
cried	1
Fanshaw,	1
who	1
was	1
very	1
white.	1
"But	1
you	1
can't	1
mean--"	1
"I	1
mean,"	1
said	1
Father	1
Brown,	1
"that	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
Admiral's	1
scientific	1
predictions	1
is	1
coming	1
true	1
tonight.	1
This	1
story	1
is	1
going	1
to	1
end	1
in	1
smoke."	1
As	1
he	1
spoke	1
a	1
most	1
beautiful	1
rose-red	1
light	1
seemed	1
to	1
burst	1
into	1
blossom	1
like	1
a	1
gigantic	1
rose;	1
but	1
accompanied	1
with	1
a	1
crackling	1
and	1
rattling	1
noise	1
that	1
was	1
like	1
the	1
laughter	1
of	1
devils.	1
"My	1
God!	1
what	1
is	1
this?"	1
cried	1
Sir	1
Cecil	1
Fanshaw.	1
"The	1
sign	1
of	1
the	1
flaming	1
tower,"	1
said	1
Father	1
Brown,	1
and	1
sent	1
the	1
driving	1
water	1
from	1
his	1
hose	1
into	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
the	1
red	1
patch.	1
"Lucky	1
we	1
hadn't	1
gone	1
to	1
bed!"	1
ejaculated	1
Fanshaw.	1
"I	1
suppose	1
it	1
can't	1
spread	1
to	1
the	1
house."	1
"You	1
may	1
remember,"	1
said	1
the	1
priest	1
quietly,	1
"that	1
the	1
wooden	1
fence	1
that	1
might	1
have	1
carried	1
it	1
was	1
cut	1
away."	1
Flambeau	1
turned	1
electrified	1
eyes	1
upon	1
his	1
friend,	1
but	1
Fanshaw	1
only	1
said	1
rather	1
absently:	1
"Well,	1
nobody	1
can	1
be	1
killed,	1
anyhow."	1
"This	1
is	1
rather	1
a	1
curious	1
kind	1
of	1
tower,"	1
observed	1
Father	1
Brown,	1
"when	1
it	1
takes	1
to	1
killing	1
people,	1
it	1
always	1
kills	1
people	1
who	1
are	1
somewhere	1
else."	1
At	1
the	1
same	1
instant	1
the	1
monstrous	1
figure	1
of	1
the	1
gardener	1
with	1
the	1
streaming	1
beard	1
stood	1
again	1
on	1
the	1
green	1
ridge	1
against	1
the	1
sky,	1
waving	1
others	1
to	1
come	1
on;	1
but	1
now	1
waving	1
not	1
a	1
rake	1
but	1
a	1
cutlass.	1
Behind	1
him	1
came	1
the	1
two	1
negroes,	1
also	1
with	1
the	1
old	1
crooked	1
cutlasses	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
trophy.	1
But	1
in	1
the	1
blood-red	1
glare,	1
with	1
their	1
black	1
faces	1
and	1
yellow	1
figures,	1
they	1
looked	1
like	1
devils	1
carrying	1
instruments	1
of	1
torture.	1
In	1
the	1
dim	1
garden	1
behind	1
them	1
a	1
distant	1
voice	1
was	1
heard	1
calling	1
out	1
brief	1
directions.	1
When	1
the	1
priest	1
heard	1
the	1
voice,	1
a	1
terrible	1
change	1
came	1
over	1
his	1
countenance.	1
But	1
he	1
remained	1
composed;	1
and	1
never	1
took	1
his	1
eye	1
off	1
the	1
patch	1
of	1
flame	1
which	1
had	1
begun	1
by	1
spreading,	1
but	1
now	1
seemed	1
to	1
shrink	1
a	1
little	1
as	1
it	1
hissed	1
under	1
the	1
torch	1
of	1
the	1
long	1
silver	1
spear	1
of	1
water.	1
He	1
kept	1
his	1
finger	1
along	1
the	1
nozzle	1
of	1
the	1
pipe	1
to	1
ensure	1
the	1
aim,	1
and	1
attended	1
to	1
no	1
other	1
business,	1
knowing	1
only	1
by	1
the	1
noise	1
and	1
that	1
semi-conscious	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
eye,	1
the	1
exciting	1
incidents	1
that	1
began	1
to	1
tumble	1
themselves	1
about	1
the	1
island	1
garden.	1
He	1
gave	1
two	1
brief	1
directions	1
to	1
his	1
friends.	1
One	1
was:	1
"Knock	1
these	1
fellows	1
down	1
somehow	1
and	1
tie	1
them	1
up,	1
whoever	1
they	1
are;	1
there's	1
rope	1
down	1
by	1
those	1
faggots.	1
They	1
want	1
to	1
take	1
away	1
my	1
nice	1
hose."	1
The	1
other	1
was:	1
"As	1
soon	1
as	1
you	1
get	1
a	1
chance,	1
call	1
out	1
to	1
that	1
canoeing	1
girl;	1
she's	1
over	1
on	1
the	1
bank	1
with	1
the	1
gipsies.	1
Ask	1
her	1
if	1
they	1
could	1
get	1
some	1
buckets	1
across	1
and	1
fill	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
river."	1
Then	1
he	1
closed	1
his	1
mouth	1
and	1
continued	1
to	1
water	1
the	1
new	1
red	1
flower	1
as	1
ruthlessly	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
watered	1
the	1
red	1
tulip.	1
He	1
never	1
turned	1
his	1
head	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
strange	1
fight	1
that	1
followed	1
between	1
the	1
foes	1
and	1
friends	1
of	1
the	1
mysterious	1
fire.	1
He	1
almost	1
felt	1
the	1
island	1
shake	1
when	1
Flambeau	1
collided	1
with	1
the	1
huge	1
gardener;	1
he	1
merely	1
imagined	1
how	1
it	1
would	1
whirl	1
round	1
them	1
as	1
they	1
wrestled.	1
He	1
heard	1
the	1
crashing	1
fall;	1
and	1
his	1
friend's	1
gasp	1
of	1
triumph	1
as	1
he	1
dashed	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
first	1
negro;	1
and	1
the	1
cries	1
of	1
both	1
the	1
blacks	1
as	1
Flambeau	1
and	1
Fanshaw	1
bound	1
them.	1
Flambeau's	1
enormous	1
strength	1
more	1
than	1
redressed	1
the	1
odds	1
in	1
the	1
fight,	1
especially	1
as	1
the	1
fourth	1
man	1
still	1
hovered	1
near	1
the	1
house,	1
only	1
a	1
shadow	1
and	1
a	1
voice.	1
He	1
heard	1
also	1
the	1
water	1
broken	1
by	1
the	1
paddles	1
of	1
a	1
canoe;	1
the	1
girl's	1
voice	1
giving	1
orders,	1
the	1
voices	1
of	1
gipsies	1
answering	1
and	1
coming	1
nearer,	1
the	1
plumping	1
and	1
sucking	1
noise	1
of	1
empty	1
buckets	1
plunged	1
into	1
a	1
full	1
stream;	1
and	1
finally	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
many	1
feet	1
around	1
the	1
fire.	1
But	1
all	1
this	1
was	1
less	1
to	1
him	1
than	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
red	1
rent,	1
which	1
had	1
lately	1
once	1
more	1
increased,	1
had	1
once	1
more	1
slightly	1
diminished.	1
Then	1
came	1
a	1
cry	1
that	1
very	1
nearly	1
made	1
him	1
turn	1
his	1
head.	1
Flambeau	1
and	1
Fanshaw,	1
now	1
reinforced	1
by	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
gipsies,	1
had	1
rushed	1
after	1
the	1
mysterious	1
man	1
by	1
the	1
house;	1
and	1
he	1
heard	1
from	1
the	1
other	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
garden	1
the	1
Frenchman's	1
cry	1
of	1
horror	1
and	1
astonishment.	1
It	1
was	1
echoed	1
by	1
a	1
howl	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
called	1
human,	1
as	1
the	1
being	1
broke	1
from	1
their	1
hold	1
and	1
ran	1
along	1
the	1
garden.	1
Three	1
times	1
at	1
least	1
it	1
raced	1
round	1
the	1
whole	1
island,	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
that	1
was	1
as	1
horrible	1
as	1
the	1
chase	1
of	1
a	1
lunatic,	1
both	1
in	1
the	1
cries	1
of	1
the	1
pursued	1
and	1
the	1
ropes	1
carried	1
by	1
the	1
pursuers;	1
but	1
was	1
more	1
horrible	1
still,	1
because	1
it	1
somehow	1
suggested	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
chasing	1
games	1
of	1
children	1
in	1
a	1
garden.	1
Then,	1
finding	1
them	1
closing	1
in	1
on	1
every	1
side,	1
the	1
figure	1
sprang	1
upon	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
higher	1
river	1
banks	1
and	1
disappeared	1
with	1
a	1
splash	1
into	1
the	1
dark	1
and	1
driving	1
river.	1
"You	1
can	1
do	1
no	1
more,	1
I	1
fear,"	1
said	1
Brown	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
cold	1
with	1
pain.	1
"He	1
has	1
been	1
washed	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
rocks	1
by	1
now,	1
where	1
he	1
has	1
sent	1
so	1
many	1
others.	1
He	1
knew	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
a	1
family	1
legend."	1
"Oh,	1
don't	1
talk	1
in	1
these	1
parables,"	1
cried	1
Flambeau	1
impatiently.	1
"Can't	1
you	1
put	1
it	1
simply	1
in	1
words	1
of	1
one	1
syllable?"	1
"Yes,"	1
answered	1
Brown,	1
with	1
his	1
eye	1
on	1
the	1
hose.	1
"`Both	1
eyes	1
bright,	1
she's	1
all	1
right;	1
one	1
eye	1
blinks,	1
down	1
she	1
sinks.'"	1
The	1
fire	1
hissed	1
and	1
shrieked	1
more	1
and	1
more,	1
like	1
a	1
strangled	1
thing,	1
as	1
it	1
grew	1
narrower	1
and	1
narrower	1
under	1
the	1
flood	1
from	1
the	1
pipe	1
and	1
buckets,	1
but	1
Father	1
Brown	1
still	1
kept	1
his	1
eye	1
on	1
it	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
speaking:	1
"I	1
thought	1
of	1
asking	1
this	1
young	1
lady,	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
morning	1
yet,	1
to	1
look	1
through	1
that	1
telescope	1
at	1
the	1
river	1
mouth	1
and	1
the	1
river.	1
She	1
might	1
have	1
seen	1
something	1
to	1
interest	1
her:	1
the	1
sign	1
of	1
the	1
ship,	1
or	1
Mr	1
Walter	1
Pendragon	1
coming	1
home,	1
and	1
perhaps	1
even	1
the	1
sign	1
of	1
the	1
half-man,	1
for	1
though	1
he	1
is	1
certainly	1
safe	1
by	1
now,	1
he	1
may	1
very	1
well	1
have	1
waded	1
ashore.	1
He	1
has	1
been	1
within	1
a	1
shave	1
of	1
another	1
shipwreck;	1
and	1
would	1
never	1
have	1
escaped	1
it,	1
if	1
the	1
lady	1
hadn't	1
had	1
the	1
sense	1
to	1
suspect	1
the	1
old	1
Admiral's	1
telegram	1
and	1
come	1
down	1
to	1
watch	1
him.	1
Don't	1
let's	1
talk	1
about	1
the	1
old	1
Admiral.	1
Don't	1
let's	1
talk	1
about	1
anything.	1
It's	1
enough	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
whenever	1
this	1
tower,	1
with	1
its	1
pitch	1
and	1
resin-wood,	1
really	1
caught	1
fire,	1
the	1
spark	1
on	1
the	1
horizon	1
always	1
looked	1
like	1
the	1
twin	1
light	1
to	1
the	1
coast	1
light-house."	1
"And	1
that,"	1
said	1
Flambeau,	1
"is	1
how	1
the	1
father	1
and	1
brother	1
died.	1
The	1
wicked	1
uncle	1
of	1
the	1
legends	1
very	1
nearly	1
got	1
his	1
estate	1
after	1
all."	1
Father	1
Brown	1
did	1
not	1
answer;	1
indeed,	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
speak	1
again,	1
save	1
for	1
civilities,	1
till	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
safe	1
round	1
a	1
cigar-box	1
in	1
the	1
cabin	1
of	1
the	1
yacht.	1
He	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
frustrated	1
fire	1
was	1
extinguished;	1
and	1
then	1
refused	1
to	1
linger,	1
though	1
he	1
actually	1
heard	1
young	1
Pendragon,	1
escorted	1
by	1
an	1
enthusiastic	1
crowd,	1
come	1
tramping	1
up	1
the	1
river	1
bank;	1
and	1
might	1
(had	1
he	1
been	1
moved	1
by	1
romantic	1
curiosities)	1
have	1
received	1
the	1
combined	1
thanks	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
from	1
the	1
ship	1
and	1
the	1
girl	1
from	1
the	1
canoe.	1
But	1
his	1
fatigue	1
had	1
fallen	1
on	1
him	1
once	1
more,	1
and	1
he	1
only	1
started	1
once,	1
when	1
Flambeau	1
abruptly	1
told	1
him	1
he	1
had	1
dropped	1
cigar-ash	1
on	1
his	1
trousers.	1
"That's	1
no	1
cigar-ash,"	1
he	1
said	1
rather	1
wearily.	1
"That's	1
from	1
the	1
fire,	1
but	1
you	1
don't	1
think	1
so	1
because	1
you're	1
all	1
smoking	1
cigars.	1
That's	1
just	1
the	1
way	1
I	1
got	1
my	1
first	1
faint	1
suspicion	1
about	1
the	1
chart."	1
"Do	1
you	1
mean	1
Pendragon's	1
chart	1
of	1
his	1
Pacific	1
Islands?"	1
asked	1
Fanshaw.	1
"You	1
thought	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
chart	1
of	1
the	1
Pacific	1
Islands,"	1
answered	1
Brown.	1
"Put	1
a	1
feather	1
with	1
a	1
fossil	1
and	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
coral	1
and	1
everyone	1
will	1
think	1
it's	1
a	1
specimen.	1
Put	1
the	1
same	1
feather	1
with	1
a	1
ribbon	1
and	1
an	1
artificial	1
flower	1
and	1
everyone	1
will	1
think	1
it's	1
for	1
a	1
lady's	1
hat.	1
Put	1
the	1
same	1
feather	1
with	1
an	1
ink-bottle,	1
a	1
book	1
and	1
a	1
stack	1
of	1
writing-paper,	1
and	1
most	1
men	1
will	1
swear	1
they've	1
seen	1
a	1
quill	1
pen.	1
So	1
you	1
saw	1
that	1
map	1
among	1
tropic	1
birds	1
and	1
shells	1
and	1
thought	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
map	1
of	1
Pacific	1
Islands.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
map	1
of	1
this	1
river."	1
"But	1
how	1
do	1
you	1
know?"	1
asked	1
Fanshaw.	1
"I	1
saw	1
the	1
rock	1
you	1
thought	1
was	1
like	1
a	1
dragon,	1
and	1
the	1
one	1
like	1
Merlin,	1
and--"	1
"You	1
seem	1
to	1
have	1
noticed	1
a	1
lot	1
as	1
we	1
came	1
in,"	1
cried	1
Fanshaw.	1
"We	1
thought	1
you	1
were	1
rather	1
abstracted."	1
"I	1
was	1
sea-sick,"	1
said	1
Father	1
Brown	1
simply.	1
"I	1
felt	1
simply	1
horrible.	1
But	1
feeling	1
horrible	1
has	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
not	1
seeing	1
things."	1
And	1
he	1
closed	1
his	1
eyes.	1
"Do	1
you	1
think	1
most	1
men	1
would	1
have	1
seen	1
that?"	1
asked	1
Flambeau.	1
He	1
received	1
no	1
answer:	1
Father	1
Brown	1
was	1
asleep.	1
IX.	1
The	1
God	1
of	1
the	1
Gongs	1
IT	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
chilly	1
and	1
empty	1
afternoons	1
in	1
early	1
winter,	1
when	1
the	1
daylight	1
is	1
silver	1
rather	1
than	1
gold	1
and	1
pewter	1
rather	1
than	1
silver.	1
If	1
it	1
was	1
dreary	1
in	1
a	1
hundred	1
bleak	1
offices	1
and	1
yawning	1
drawing-rooms,	1
it	1
was	1
drearier	1
still	1
along	1
the	1
edges	1
of	1
the	1
flat	1
Essex	1
coast,	1
where	1
the	1
monotony	1
was	1
the	1
more	1
inhuman	1
for	1
being	1
broken	1
at	1
very	1
long	1
intervals	1
by	1
a	1
lamp-post	1
that	1
looked	1
less	1
civilized	1
than	1
a	1
tree,	1
or	1
a	1
tree	1
that	1
looked	1
more	1
ugly	1
than	1
a	1
lamp-post.	1
A	1
light	1
fall	1
of	1
snow	1
had	1
half-melted	1
into	1
a	1
few	1
strips,	1
also	1
looking	1
leaden	1
rather	1
than	1
silver,	1
when	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
fixed	1
again	1
by	1
the	1
seal	1
of	1
frost;	1
no	1
fresh	1
snow	1
had	1
fallen,	1
but	1
a	1
ribbon	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
snow	1
ran	1
along	1
the	1
very	1
margin	1
of	1
the	1
coast,	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
parallel	1
the	1
pale	1
ribbon	1
of	1
the	1
foam.	1
The	1
line	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
looked	1
frozen	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
vividness	1
of	1
its	1
violet-blue,	1
like	1
the	1
vein	1
of	1
a	1
frozen	1
finger.	1
For	1
miles	1
and	1
miles,	1
forward	1
and	1
back,	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
breathing	1
soul,	1
save	1
two	1
pedestrians,	1
walking	1
at	1
a	1
brisk	1
pace,	1
though	1
one	1
had	1
much	1
longer	1
legs	1
and	1
took	1
much	1
longer	1
strides	1
than	1
the	1
other.	1
It	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
a	1
very	1
appropriate	1
place	1
or	1
time	1
for	1
a	1
holiday,	1
but	1
Father	1
Brown	1
had	1
few	1
holidays,	1
and	1
had	1
to	1
take	1
them	1
when	1
he	1
could,	1
and	1
he	1
always	1
preferred,	1
if	1
possible,	1
to	1
take	1
them	1
in	1
company	1
with	1
his	1
old	1
friend	1
Flambeau,	1
ex-criminal	1
and	1
ex-detective.	1
The	1
priest	1
had	1
had	1
a	1
fancy	1
for	1
visiting	1
his	1
old	1
parish	1
at	1
Cobhole,	1
and	1
was	1
going	1
north-eastward	1
along	1
the	1
coast.	1
After	1
walking	1
a	1
mile	1
or	1
two	1
farther,	1
they	1
found	1
that	1
the	1
shore	1
was	1
beginning	1
to	1
be	1
formally	1
embanked,	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
form	1
something	1
like	1
a	1
parade;	1
the	1
ugly	1
lamp-posts	1
became	1
less	1
few	1
and	1
far	1
between	1
and	1
more	1
ornamental,	1
though	1
quite	1
equally	1
ugly.	1
Half	1
a	1
mile	1
farther	1
on	1
Father	1
Brown	1
was	1
puzzled	1
first	1
by	1
little	1
labyrinths	1
of	1
flowerless	1
flower-pots,	1
covered	1
with	1
the	1
low,	1
flat,	1
quiet-coloured	1
plants	1
that	1
look	1
less	1
like	1
a	1
garden	1
than	1
a	1
tessellated	1
pavement,	1
between	1
weak	1
curly	1
paths	1
studded	1
with	1
seats	1
with	1
curly	1
backs.	1
He	1
faintly	1
sniffed	1
the	1
atmosphere	1
of	1
a	1
certain	1
sort	1
of	1
seaside	1
town	1
that	1
be	1
did	1
not	1
specially	1
care	1
about,	1
and,	1
looking	1
ahead	1
along	1
the	1
parade	1
by	1
the	1
sea,	1
he	1
saw	1
something	1
that	1
put	1
the	1
matter	1
beyond	1
a	1
doubt.	1
In	1
the	1
grey	1
distance	1
the	1
big	1
bandstand	1
of	1
a	1
watering-place	1
stood	1
up	1
like	1
a	1
giant	1
mushroom	1
with	1
six	1
legs.	1
"I	1
suppose,"	1
said	1
Father	1
Brown,	1
turning	1
up	1
his	1
coat-collar	1
and	1
drawing	1
a	1
woollen	1
scarf	1
rather	1
closer	1
round	1
his	1
neck,	1
"that	1
we	1
are	1
approaching	1
a	1
pleasure	1
resort."	1
"I	1
fear,"	1
answered	1
Flambeau,	1
"a	1
pleasure	1
resort	1
to	1
which	1
few	1
people	1
just	1
now	1
have	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
resorting.	1
They	1
try	1
to	1
revive	1
these	1
places	1
in	1
the	1
winter,	1
but	1
it	1
never	1
succeeds	1
except	1
with	1
Brighton	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
ones.	1
This	1
must	1
be	1
Seawood,	1
I	1
think--	1
Lord	1
Pooley's	1
experiment;	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
Sicilian	1
Singers	1
down	1
at	1
Christmas,	1
and	1
there's	1
talk	1
about	1
holding	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
glove-fights	1
here.	1
But	1
they'll	1
have	1
to	1
chuck	1
the	1
rotten	1
place	1
into	1
the	1
sea;	1
it's	1
as	1
dreary	1
as	1
a	1
lost	1
railway-carriage."	1
They	1
had	1
come	1
under	1
the	1
big	1
bandstand,	1
and	1
the	1
priest	1
was	1
looking	1
up	1
at	1
it	1
with	1
a	1
curiosity	1
that	1
had	1
something	1
rather	1
odd	1
about	1
it,	1
his	1
head	1
a	1
little	1
on	1
one	1
side,	1
like	1
a	1
bird's.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
conventional,	1
rather	1
tawdry	1
kind	1
of	1
erection	1
for	1
its	1
purpose:	1
a	1
flattened	1
dome	1
or	1
canopy,	1
gilt	1
here	1
and	1
there,	1
and	1
lifted	1
on	1
six	1
slender	1
pillars	1
of	1
painted	1
wood,	1
the	1
whole	1
being	1
raised	1
about	1
five	1
feet	1
above	1
the	1
parade	1
on	1
a	1
round	1
wooden	1
platform	1
like	1
a	1
drum.	1
But	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
fantastic	1
about	1
the	1
snow	1
combined	1
with	1
something	1
artificial	1
about	1
the	1
gold	1
that	1
haunted	1
Flambeau	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
his	1
friend	1
with	1
some	1
association	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
capture,	1
but	1
which	1
he	1
knew	1
was	1
at	1
once	1
artistic	1
and	1
alien.	1
"I've	1
got	1
it,"	1
he	1
said	1
at	1
last.	1
"It's	1
Japanese.	1
It's	1
like	1
those	1
fanciful	1
Japanese	1
prints,	1
where	1
the	1
snow	1
on	1
the	1
mountain	1
looks	1
like	1
sugar,	1
and	1
the	1
gilt	1
on	1
the	1
pagodas	1
is	1
like	1
gilt	1
on	1
gingerbread.	1
It	1
looks	1
just	1
like	1
a	1
little	1
pagan	1
temple."	1
"Yes,"	1
said	1
Father	1
Brown.	1
"Let's	1
have	1
a	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
god."	1
And	1
with	1
an	1
agility	1
hardly	1
to	1
be	1
expected	1
of	1
him,	1
he	1
hopped	1
up	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
raised	1
platform.	1
"Oh,	1
very	1
well,"	1
said	1
Flambeau,	1
laughing;	1
and	1
the	1
next	1
instant	1
his	1
own	1
towering	1
figure	1
was	1
visible	1
on	1
that	1
quaint	1
elevation.	1
Slight	1
as	1
was	1
the	1
difference	1
of	1
height,	1
it	1
gave	1
in	1
those	1
level	1
wastes	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
seeing	1
yet	1
farther	1
and	1
farther	1
across	1
land	1
and	1
sea.	1
Inland	1
the	1
little	1
wintry	1
gardens	1
faded	1
into	1
a	1
confused	1
grey	1
copse;	1
beyond	1
that,	1
in	1
the	1
distance,	1
were	1
long	1
low	1
barns	1
of	1
a	1
lonely	1
farmhouse,	1
and	1
beyond	1
that	1
nothing	1
but	1
the	1
long	1
East	1
Anglian	1
plains.	1
Seawards	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
sail	1
or	1
sign	1
of	1
life	1
save	1
a	1
few	1
seagulls:	1
and	1
even	1
they	1
looked	1
like	1
the	1
last	1
snowflakes,	1
and	1
seemed	1
to	1
float	1
rather	1
than	1
fly.	1
Flambeau	1
turned	1
abruptly	1
at	1
an	1
exclamation	1
behind	1
him.	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
come	1
from	1
lower	1
down	1
than	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
expected,	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
addressed	1
to	1
his	1
heels	1
rather	1
than	1
his	1
head.	1
He	1
instantly	1
held	1
out	1
his	1
hand,	1
but	1
he	1
could	1
hardly	1
help	1
laughing	1
at	1
what	1
he	1
saw.	1
For	1
some	1
reason	1
or	1
other	1
the	1
platform	1
had	1
given	1
way	1
under	1
Father	1
Brown,	1
and	1
the	1
unfortunate	1
little	1
man	1
had	1
dropped	1
through	1
to	1
the	1
level	1
of	1
the	1
parade.	1
He	1
was	1
just	1
tall	1
enough,	1
or	1
short	1
enough,	1
for	1
his	1
head	1
alone	1
to	1
stick	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hole	1
in	1
the	1
broken	1
wood,	1
looking	1
like	1
St	1
John	1
the	1
Baptist's	1
head	1
on	1
a	1
charger.	1
The	1
face	1
wore	1
a	1
disconcerted	1
expression,	1
as	1
did,	1
perhaps,	1
that	1
of	1
St	1
John	1
the	1
Baptist.	1
In	1
a	1
moment	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
laugh	1
a	1
little.	1
"This	1
wood	1
must	1
be	1
rotten,"	1
said	1
Flambeau.	1
"Though	1
it	1
seems	1
odd	1
it	1
should	1
bear	1
me,	1
and	1
you	1
go	1
through	1
the	1
weak	1
place.	1
Let	1
me	1
help	1
you	1
out."	1
But	1
the	1
little	1
priest	1
was	1
looking	1
rather	1
curiously	1
at	1
the	1
corners	1
and	1
edges	1
of	1
the	1
wood	1
alleged	1
to	1
be	1
rotten,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
trouble	1
on	1
his	1
brow.	1
"Come	1
along,"	1
cried	1
Flambeau	1
impatiently,	1
still	1
with	1
his	1
big	1
brown	1
hand	1
extended.	1
"Don't	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
get	1
out?"	1
The	1
priest	1
was	1
holding	1
a	1
splinter	1
of	1
the	1
broken	1
wood	1
between	1
his	1
finger	1
and	1
thumb,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
immediately	1
reply.	1
At	1
last	1
he	1
said	1
thoughtfully:	1
"Want	1
to	1
get	1
out?	1
Why,	1
no.	1
I	1
rather	1
think	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
get	1
in."	1
And	1
he	1
dived	1
into	1
the	1
darkness	1
under	1
the	1
wooden	1
floor	1
so	1
abruptly	1
as	1
to	1
knock	1
off	1
his	1
big	1
curved	1
clerical	1
hat	1
and	1
leave	1
it	1
lying	1
on	1
the	1
boards	1
above,	1
without	1
any	1
clerical	1
head	1
in	1
it.	1
Flambeau	1
looked	1
once	1
more	1
inland	1
and	1
out	1
to	1
sea,	1
and	1
once	1
more	1
could	1
see	1
nothing	1
but	1
seas	1
as	1
wintry	1
as	1
the	1
snow,	1
and	1
snows	1
as	1
level	1
as	1
the	1
sea.	1
There	1
came	1
a	1
scurrying	1
noise	1
behind	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
priest	1
came	1
scrambling	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hole	1
faster	1
than	1
he	1
had	1
fallen	1
in.	1
His	1
face	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
disconcerted,	1
but	1
rather	1
resolute,	1
and,	1
perhaps	1
only	1
through	1
the	1
reflections	1
of	1
the	1
snow,	1
a	1
trifle	1
paler	1
than	1
usual.	1
"Well?"	1
asked	1
his	1
tall	1
friend.	1
"Have	1
you	1
found	1
the	1
god	1
of	1
the	1
temple?"	1
"No,"	1
answered	1
Father	1
Brown.	1
"I	1
have	1
found	1
what	1
was	1
sometimes	1
more	1
important.	1
The	1
Sacrifice."	1
"What	1
the	1
devil	1
do	1
you	1
mean?"	1
cried	1
Flambeau,	1
quite	1
alarmed.	1
Father	1
Brown	1
did	1
not	1
answer.	1
He	1
was	1
staring,	1
with	1
a	1
knot	1
in	1
his	1
forehead,	1
at	1
the	1
landscape;	1
and	1
he	1
suddenly	1
pointed	1
at	1
it.	1
"What's	1
that	1
house	1
over	1
there?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
Following	1
his	1
finger,	1
Flambeau	1
saw	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
the	1
corners	1
of	1
a	1
building	1
nearer	1
than	1
the	1
farmhouse,	1
but	1
screened	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
part	1
with	1
a	1
fringe	1
of	1
trees.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
large	1
building,	1
and	1
stood	1
well	1
back	1
from	1
the	1
shore--,	1
but	1
a	1
glint	1
of	1
ornament	1
on	1
it	1
suggested	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
watering-place	1
scheme	1
of	1
decoration	1
as	1
the	1
bandstand,	1
the	1
little	1
gardens	1
and	1
the	1
curly-backed	1
iron	1
seats.	1
Father	1
Brown	1
jumped	1
off	1
the	1
bandstand,	1
his	1
friend	1
following;	1
and	1
as	1
they	1
walked	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
indicated	1
the	1
trees	1
fell	1
away	1
to	1
right	1
and	1
left,	1
and	1
they	1
saw	1
a	1
small,	1
rather	1
flashy	1
hotel,	1
such	1
as	1
is	1
common	1
in	1
resorts--the	1
hotel	1
of	1
the	1
Saloon	1
Bar	1
rather	1
than	1
the	1
Bar	1
Parlour.	1
Almost	1
the	1
whole	1
frontage	1
was	1
of	1
gilt	1
plaster	1
and	1
figured	1
glass,	1
and	1
between	1
that	1
grey	1
seascape	1
and	1
the	1
grey,	1
witch-like	1
trees,	1
its	1
gimcrack	1
quality	1
had	1
something	1
spectral	1
in	1
its	1
melancholy.	1
They	1
both	1
felt	1
vaguely	1
that	1
if	1
any	1
food	1
or	1
drink	1
were	1
offered	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
hostelry,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
paste-board	1
ham	1
and	1
empty	1
mug	1
of	1
the	1
pantomime.	1
In	1
this,	1
however,	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
altogether	1
confirmed.	1
As	1
they	1
drew	1
nearer	1
and	1
nearer	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
they	1
saw	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
buffet,	1
which	1
was	1
apparently	1
closed,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
iron	1
garden-seats	1
with	1
curly	1
backs	1
that	1
had	1
adorned	1
the	1
gardens,	1
but	1
much	1
longer,	1
running	1
almost	1
the	1
whole	1
length	1
of	1
the	1
frontage.	1
Presumably,	1
it	1
was	1
placed	1
so	1
that	1
visitors	1
might	1
sit	1
there	1
and	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
sea,	1
but	1
one	1
hardly	1
expected	1
to	1
find	1
anyone	1
doing	1
it	1
in	1
such	1
weather.	1
Nevertheless,	1
just	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
extreme	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
iron	1
seat	1
stood	1
a	1
small	1
round	1
restaurant	1
table,	1
and	1
on	1
this	1
stood	1
a	1
small	1
bottle	1
of	1
Chablis	1
and	1
a	1
plate	1
of	1
almonds	1
and	1
raisins.	1
Behind	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
seat	1
sat	1
a	1
dark-haired	1
young	1
man,	1
bareheaded,	1
and	1
gazing	1
at	1
the	1
sea	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
almost	1
astonishing	1
immobility.	1
But	1
though	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
waxwork	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
within	1
four	1
yards	1
of	1
him,	1
he	1
jumped	1
up	1
like	1
a	1
jack-in-the-box	1
when	1
they	1
came	1
within	1
three,	1
and	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
deferential,	1
though	1
not	1
undignified,	1
manner:	1
"Will	1
you	1
step	1
inside,	1
gentlemen?	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
staff	1
at	1
present,	1
but	1
I	1
can	1
get	1
you	1
anything	1
simple	1
myself."	1
"Much	1
obliged,"	1
said	1
Flambeau.	1
"So	1
you	1
are	1
the	1
proprietor?"	1
"Yes,"	1
said	1
the	1
dark	1
man,	1
dropping	1
back	1
a	1
little	1
into	1
his	1
motionless	1
manner.	1
"My	1
waiters	1
are	1
all	1
Italians,	1
you	1
see,	1
and	1
I	1
thought	1
it	1
only	1
fair	1
they	1
should	1
see	1
their	1
countryman	1
beat	1
the	1
black,	1
if	1
he	1
really	1
can	1
do	1
it.	1
You	1
know	1
the	1
great	1
fight	1
between	1
Malvoli	1
and	1
Nigger	1
Ned	1
is	1
coming	1
off	1
after	1
all?"	1
"I'm	1
afraid	1
we	1
can't	1
wait	1
to	1
trouble	1
your	1
hospitality	1
seriously,"	1
said	1
Father	1
Brown.	1
"But	1
my	1
friend	1
would	1
be	1
glad	1
of	1
a	1
glass	1
of	1
sherry,	1
I'm	1
sure,	1
to	1
keep	1
out	1
the	1
cold	1
and	1
drink	1
success	1
to	1
the	1
Latin	1
champion."	1
Flambeau	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
the	1
sherry,	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
object	1
to	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
least.	1
He	1
could	1
only	1
say	1
amiably:	1
"Oh,	1
thank	1
you	1
very	1
much."	1
"Sherry,	1
sir--certainly,"	1
said	1
their	1
host,	1
turning	1
to	1
his	1
hostel.	1
"Excuse	1
me	1
if	1
I	1
detain	1
you	1
a	1
few	1
minutes.	1
As	1
I	1
told	1
you,	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
staff--"	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
towards	1
the	1
black	1
windows	1
of	1
his	1
shuttered	1
and	1
unlighted	1
inn.	1
"Oh,	1
it	1
doesn't	1
really	1
matter,"	1
began	1
Flambeau,	1
but	1
the	1
man	1
turned	1
to	1
reassure	1
him.	1
"I	1
have	1
the	1
keys,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"I	1
could	1
find	1
my	1
way	1
in	1
the	1
dark."	1
"I	1
didn't	1
mean--"	1
began	1
Father	1
Brown.	1
He	1
was	1
interrupted	1
by	1
a	1
bellowing	1
human	1
voice	1
that	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
bowels	1
of	1
the	1
uninhabited	1
hotel.	1
It	1
thundered	1
some	1
foreign	1
name	1
loudly	1
but	1
inaudibly,	1
and	1
the	1
hotel	1
proprietor	1
moved	1
more	1
sharply	1
towards	1
it	1
than	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
for	1
Flambeau's	1
sherry.	1
As	1
instant	1
evidence	1
proved,	1
the	1
proprietor	1
had	1
told,	1
then	1
and	1
after,	1
nothing	1
but	1
the	1
literal	1
truth.	1
But	1
both	1
Flambeau	1
and	1
Father	1
Brown	1
have	1
often	1
confessed	1
that,	1
in	1
all	1
their	1
(often	1
outrageous)	1
adventures,	1
nothing	1
had	1
so	1
chilled	1
their	1
blood	1
as	1
that	1
voice	1
of	1
an	1
ogre,	1
sounding	1
suddenly	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
silent	1
and	1
empty	1
inn.	1
"My	1
cook!"	1
cried	1
the	1
proprietor	1
hastily.	1
"I	1
had	1
forgotten	1
my	1
cook.	1
He	1
will	1
be	1
starting	1
presently.	1
Sherry,	1
sir?"	1
And,	1
sure	1
enough,	1
there	1
appeared	1
in	1
the	1
doorway	1
a	1
big	1
white	1
bulk	1
with	1
white	1
cap	1
and	1
white	1
apron,	1
as	1
befits	1
a	1
cook,	1
but	1
with	1
the	1
needless	1
emphasis	1
of	1
a	1
black	1
face.	1
Flambeau	1
had	1
often	1
heard	1
that	1
negroes	1
made	1
good	1
cooks.	1
But	1
somehow	1
something	1
in	1
the	1
contrast	1
of	1
colour	1
and	1
caste	1
increased	1
his	1
surprise	1
that	1
the	1
hotel	1
proprietor	1
should	1
answer	1
the	1
call	1
of	1
the	1
cook,	1
and	1
not	1
the	1
cook	1
the	1
call	1
of	1
the	1
proprietor.	1
But	1
he	1
reflected	1
that	1
head	1
cooks	1
are	1
proverbially	1
arrogant;	1
and,	1
besides,	1
the	1
host	1
had	1
come	1
back	1
with	1
the	1
sherry,	1
and	1
that	1
was	1
the	1
great	1
thing.	1
"I	1
rather	1
wonder,"	1
said	1
Father	1
Brown,	1
"that	1
there	1
are	1
so	1
few	1
people	1
about	1
the	1
beach,	1
when	1
this	1
big	1
fight	1
is	1
coming	1
on	1
after	1
all.	1
We	1
only	1
met	1
one	1
man	1
for	1
miles."	1
The	1
hotel	1
proprietor	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders.	1
"They	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
other	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
town,	1
you	1
see--from	1
the	1
station,	1
three	1
miles	1
from	1
here.	1
They	1
are	1
only	1
interested	1
in	1
the	1
sport,	1
and	1
will	1
stop	1
in	1
hotels	1
for	1
the	1
night	1
only.	1
After	1
all,	1
it	1
is	1
hardly	1
weather	1
for	1
basking	1
on	1
the	1
shore."	1
"Or	1
on	1
the	1
seat,"	1
said	1
Flambeau,	1
and	1
pointed	1
to	1
the	1
little	1
table.	1
"I	1
have	1
to	1
keep	1
a	1
look-out,"	1
said	1
the	1
man	1
with	1
the	1
motionless	1
face.	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
quiet,	1
well-featured	1
fellow,	1
rather	1
sallow;	1
his	1
dark	1
clothes	1
had	1
nothing	1
distinctive	1
about	1
them,	1
except	1
that	1
his	1
black	1
necktie	1
was	1
worn	1
rather	1
high,	1
like	1
a	1
stock,	1
and	1
secured	1
by	1
a	1
gold	1
pin	1
with	1
some	1
grotesque	1
head	1
to	1
it.	1
Nor	1
was	1
there	1
anything	1
notable	1
in	1
the	1
face,	1
except	1
something	1
that	1
was	1
probably	1
a	1
mere	1
nervous	1
trick--	1
a	1
habit	1
of	1
opening	1
one	1
eye	1
more	1
narrowly	1
than	1
the	1
other,	1
giving	1
the	1
impression	1
that	1
the	1
other	1
was	1
larger,	1
or	1
was,	1
perhaps,	1
artificial.	1
The	1
silence	1
that	1
ensued	1
was	1
broken	1
by	1
their	1
host	1
saying	1
quietly:	1
"Whereabouts	1
did	1
you	1
meet	1
the	1
one	1
man	1
on	1
your	1
march?"	1
"Curiously	1
enough,"	1
answered	1
the	1
priest,	1
"close	1
by	1
here--	1
just	1
by	1
that	1
bandstand."	1
Flambeau,	1
who	1
had	1
sat	1
on	1
the	1
long	1
iron	1
seat	1
to	1
finish	1
his	1
sherry,	1
put	1
it	1
down	1
and	1
rose	1
to	1
his	1
feet,	1
staring	1
at	1
his	1
friend	1
in	1
amazement.	1
He	1
opened	1
his	1
mouth	1
to	1
speak,	1
and	1
then	1
shut	1
it	1
again.	1
"Curious,"	1
said	1
the	1
dark-haired	1
man	1
thoughtfully.	1
"What	1
was	1
he	1
like?"	1
"It	1
was	1
rather	1
dark	1
when	1
I	1
saw	1
him,"	1
began	1
Father	1
Brown,	1
"but	1
he	1
was--"	1
As	1
has	1
been	1
said,	1
the	1
hotel-keeper	1
can	1
be	1
proved	1
to	1
have	1
told	1
the	1
precise	1
truth.	1
His	1
phrase	1
that	1
the	1
cook	1
was	1
starting	1
presently	1
was	1
fulfilled	1
to	1
the	1
letter,	1
for	1
the	1
cook	1
came	1
out,	1
pulling	1
his	1
gloves	1
on,	1
even	1
as	1
they	1
spoke.	1
But	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
different	1
figure	1
from	1
the	1
confused	1
mass	1
of	1
white	1
and	1
black	1
that	1
had	1
appeared	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
in	1
the	1
doorway.	1
He	1
was	1
buttoned	1
and	1
buckled	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
bursting	1
eyeballs	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
brilliant	1
fashion.	1
A	1
tall	1
black	1
hat	1
was	1
tilted	1
on	1
his	1
broad	1
black	1
head--	1
a	1
hat	1
of	1
the	1
sort	1
that	1
the	1
French	1
wit	1
has	1
compared	1
to	1
eight	1
mirrors.	1
But	1
somehow	1
the	1
black	1
man	1
was	1
like	1
the	1
black	1
hat.	1
He	1
also	1
was	1
black,	1
and	1
yet	1
his	1
glossy	1
skin	1
flung	1
back	1
the	1
light	1
at	1
eight	1
angles	1
or	1
more.	1
It	1
is	1
needless	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
he	1
wore	1
white	1
spats	1
and	1
a	1
white	1
slip	1
inside	1
his	1
waistcoat.	1
The	1
red	1
flower	1
stood	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
buttonhole	1
aggressively,	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
suddenly	1
grown	1
there.	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
he	1
carried	1
his	1
cane	1
in	1
one	1
hand	1
and	1
his	1
cigar	1
in	1
the	1
other	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
certain	1
attitude--	1
an	1
attitude	1
we	1
must	1
always	1
remember	1
when	1
we	1
talk	1
of	1
racial	1
prejudices:	1
something	1
innocent	1
and	1
insolent--the	1
cake	1
walk.	1
"Sometimes,"	1
said	1
Flambeau,	1
looking	1
after	1
him,	1
"I'm	1
not	1
surprised	1
that	1
they	1
lynch	1
them."	1
"I	1
am	1
never	1
surprised,"	1
said	1
Father	1
Brown,	1
"at	1
any	1
work	1
of	1
hell.	1
But	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
saying,"	1
he	1
resumed,	1
as	1
the	1
negro,	1
still	1
ostentatiously	1
pulling	1
on	1
his	1
yellow	1
gloves,	1
betook	1
himself	1
briskly	1
towards	1
the	1
watering-place,	1
a	1
queer	1
music-hall	1
figure	1
against	1
that	1
grey	1
and	1
frosty	1
scene--"as	1
I	1
was	1
saying,	1
I	1
couldn't	1
describe	1
the	1
man	1
very	1
minutely,	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
flourish	1
and	1
old-fashioned	1
whiskers	1
and	1
moustachios,	1
dark	1
or	1
dyed,	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
pictures	1
of	1
foreign	1
financiers,	1
round	1
his	1
neck	1
was	1
wrapped	1
a	1
long	1
purple	1
scarf	1
that	1
thrashed	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
wind	1
as	1
he	1
walked.	1
It	1
was	1
fixed	1
at	1
the	1
throat	1
rather	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
that	1
nurses	1
fix	1
children's	1
comforters	1
with	1
a	1
safety-pin.	1
Only	1
this,"	1
added	1
the	1
priest,	1
gazing	1
placidly	1
out	1
to	1
sea,	1
"was	1
not	1
a	1
safety-pin."	1
The	1
man	1
sitting	1
on	1
the	1
long	1
iron	1
bench	1
was	1
also	1
gazing	1
placidly	1
out	1
to	1
sea.	1
Now	1
he	1
was	1
once	1
more	1
in	1
repose.	1
Flambeau	1
felt	1
quite	1
certain	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
eyes	1
was	1
naturally	1
larger	1
than	1
the	1
other.	1
Both	1
were	1
now	1
well	1
opened,	1
and	1
he	1
could	1
almost	1
fancy	1
the	1
left	1
eye	1
grew	1
larger	1
as	1
he	1
gazed.	1
"It	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
long	1
gold	1
pin,	1
and	1
had	1
the	1
carved	1
head	1
of	1
a	1
monkey	1
or	1
some	1
such	1
thing,"	1
continued	1
the	1
cleric;	1
"and	1
it	1
was	1
fixed	1
in	1
a	1
rather	1
odd	1
way--he	1
wore	1
pince-nez	1
and	1
a	1
broad	1
black--"	1
The	1
motionless	1
man	1
continued	1
to	1
gaze	1
at	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
the	1
eyes	1
in	1
his	1
head	1
might	1
have	1
belonged	1
to	1
two	1
different	1
men.	1
Then	1
he	1
made	1
a	1
movement	1
of	1
blinding	1
swiftness.	1
Father	1
Brown	1
had	1
his	1
back	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
in	1
that	1
flash	1
might	1
have	1
fallen	1
dead	1
on	1
his	1
face.	1
Flambeau	1
had	1
no	1
weapon,	1
but	1
his	1
large	1
brown	1
hands	1
were	1
resting	1
on	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
long	1
iron	1
seat.	1
His	1
shoulders	1
abruptly	1
altered	1
their	1
shape,	1
and	1
he	1
heaved	1
the	1
whole	1
huge	1
thing	1
high	1
over	1
his	1
head,	1
like	1
a	1
headsman's	1
axe	1
about	1
to	1
fall.	1
The	1
mere	1
height	1
of	1
the	1
thing,	1
as	1
he	1
held	1
it	1
vertical,	1
looked	1
like	1
a	1
long	1
iron	1
ladder	1
by	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
inviting	1
men	1
to	1
climb	1
towards	1
the	1
stars.	1
But	1
the	1
long	1
shadow,	1
in	1
the	1
level	1
evening	1
light,	1
looked	1
like	1
a	1
giant	1
brandishing	1
the	1
Eiffel	1
Tower.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
shock	1
of	1
that	1
shadow,	1
before	1
the	1
shock	1
of	1
the	1
iron	1
crash,	1
that	1
made	1
the	1
stranger	1
quail	1
and	1
dodge,	1
and	1
then	1
dart	1
into	1
his	1
inn,	1
leaving	1
the	1
flat	1
and	1
shining	1
dagger	1
he	1
had	1
dropped	1
exactly	1
where	1
it	1
had	1
fallen.	1
"We	1
must	1
get	1
away	1
from	1
here	1
instantly,"	1
cried	1
Flambeau,	1
flinging	1
the	1
huge	1
seat	1
away	1
with	1
furious	1
indifference	1
on	1
the	1
beach.	1
He	1
caught	1
the	1
little	1
priest	1
by	1
the	1
elbow	1
and	1
ran	1
him	1
down	1
a	1
grey	1
perspective	1
of	1
barren	1
back	1
garden,	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
which	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
closed	1
back	1
garden	1
door.	1
Flambeau	1
bent	1
over	1
it	1
an	1
instant	1
in	1
violent	1
silence,	1
and	1
then	1
said:	1
"The	1
door	1
is	1
locked."	1
As	1
he	1
spoke	1
a	1
black	1
feather	1
from	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
ornamental	1
firs	1
fell,	1
brushing	1
the	1
brim	1
of	1
his	1
hat.	1
It	1
startled	1
him	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
small	1
and	1
distant	1
detonation	1
that	1
had	1
come	1
just	1
before.	1
Then	1
came	1
another	1
distant	1
detonation,	1
and	1
the	1
door	1
he	1
was	1
trying	1
to	1
open	1
shook	1
under	1
the	1
bullet	1
buried	1
in	1
it.	1
Flambeau's	1
shoulders	1
again	1
filled	1
out	1
and	1
altered	1
suddenly.	1
Three	1
hinges	1
and	1
a	1
lock	1
burst	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
instant,	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
empty	1
path	1
behind,	1
carrying	1
the	1
great	1
garden	1
door	1
with	1
him,	1
as	1
Samson	1
carried	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
Gaza.	1
Then	1
he	1
flung	1
the	1
garden	1
door	1
over	1
the	1
garden	1
wall,	1
just	1
as	1
a	1
third	1
shot	1
picked	1
up	1
a	1
spurt	1
of	1
snow	1
and	1
dust	1
behind	1
his	1
heel.	1
Without	1
ceremony	1
he	1
snatched	1
up	1
the	1
little	1
priest,	1
slung	1
him	1
astraddle	1
on	1
his	1
shoulders,	1
and	1
went	1
racing	1
towards	1
Seawood	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
his	1
long	1
legs	1
could	1
carry	1
him.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
until	1
nearly	1
two	1
miles	1
farther	1
on	1
that	1
he	1
set	1
his	1
small	1
companion	1
down.	1
It	1
had	1
hardly	1
been	1
a	1
dignified	1
escape,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
classic	1
model	1
of	1
Anchises,	1
but	1
Father	1
Brown's	1
face	1
only	1
wore	1
a	1
broad	1
grin.	1
"Well,"	1
said	1
Flambeau,	1
after	1
an	1
impatient	1
silence,	1
as	1
they	1
resumed	1
their	1
more	1
conventional	1
tramp	1
through	1
the	1
streets	1
on	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
town,	1
where	1
no	1
outrage	1
need	1
be	1
feared,	1
"I	1
don't	1
know	1
what	1
all	1
this	1
means,	1
but	1
I	1
take	1
it	1
I	1
may	1
trust	1
my	1
own	1
eyes	1
that	1
you	1
never	1
met	1
the	1
man	1
you	1
have	1
so	1
accurately	1
described."	1
"I	1
did	1
meet	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
way,"	1
Brown	1
said,	1
biting	1
his	1
finger	1
rather	1
nervously--"I	1
did	1
really.	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
too	1
dark	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
properly,	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
under	1
that	1
bandstand	1
affair.	1
But	1
I'm	1
afraid	1
I	1
didn't	1
describe	1
him	1
so	1
very	1
accurately	1
after	1
all,	1
for	1
his	1
pince-nez	1
was	1
broken	1
under	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
long	1
gold	1
pin	1
wasn't	1
stuck	1
through	1
his	1
purple	1
scarf	1
but	1
through	1
his	1
heart."	1
"And	1
I	1
suppose,"	1
said	1
the	1
other	1
in	1
a	1
lower	1
voice,	1
"that	1
glass-eyed	1
guy	1
had	1
something	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
it."	1
"I	1
had	1
hoped	1
he	1
had	1
only	1
a	1
little,"	1
answered	1
Brown	1
in	1
a	1
rather	1
troubled	1
voice,	1
"and	1
I	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
wrong	1
in	1
what	1
I	1
did.	1
I	1
acted	1
on	1
impulse.	1
But	1
I	1
fear	1
this	1
business	1
has	1
deep	1
roots	1
and	1
dark."	1
They	1
walked	1
on	1
through	1
some	1
streets	1
in	1
silence.	1
The	1
yellow	1
lamps	1
were	1
beginning	1
to	1
be	1
lit	1
in	1
the	1
cold	1
blue	1
twilight,	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
evidently	1
approaching	1
the	1
more	1
central	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
town.	1
Highly	1
coloured	1
bills	1
announcing	1
the	1
glove-fight	1
between	1
Nigger	1
Ned	1
and	1
Malvoli	1
were	1
slapped	1
about	1
the	1
walls.	1
"Well,"	1
said	1
Flambeau,	1
"I	1
never	1
murdered	1
anyone,	1
even	1
in	1
my	1
criminal	1
days,	1
but	1
I	1
can	1
almost	1
sympathize	1
with	1
anyone	1
doing	1
it	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
dreary	1
place.	1
Of	1
all	1
God-forsaken	1
dustbins	1
of	1
Nature,	1
I	1
think	1
the	1
most	1
heart-breaking	1
are	1
places	1
like	1
that	1
bandstand,	1
that	1
were	1
meant	1
to	1
be	1
festive	1
and	1
are	1
forlorn.	1
I	1
can	1
fancy	1
a	1
morbid	1
man	1
feeling	1
he	1
must	1
kill	1
his	1
rival	1
in	1
the	1
solitude	1
and	1
irony	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
scene.	1
I	1
remember	1
once	1
taking	1
a	1
tramp	1
in	1
your	1
glorious	1
Surrey	1
hills,	1
thinking	1
of	1
nothing	1
but	1
gorse	1
and	1
skylarks,	1
when	1
I	1
came	1
out	1
on	1
a	1
vast	1
circle	1
of	1
land,	1
and	1
over	1
me	1
lifted	1
a	1
vast,	1
voiceless	1
structure,	1
tier	1
above	1
tier	1
of	1
seats,	1
as	1
huge	1
as	1
a	1
Roman	1
amphitheatre	1
and	1
as	1
empty	1
as	1
a	1
new	1
letter-rack.	1
A	1
bird	1
sailed	1
in	1
heaven	1
over	1
it.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
Grand	1
Stand	1
at	1
Epsom.	1
And	1
I	1
felt	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
would	1
ever	1
be	1
happy	1
there	1
again."	1
"It's	1
odd	1
you	1
should	1
mention	1
Epsom,"	1
said	1
the	1
priest.	1
"Do	1
you	1
remember	1
what	1
was	1
called	1
the	1
Sutton	1
Mystery,	1
because	1
two	1
suspected	1
men--ice-cream	1
men,	1
I	1
think--happened	1
to	1
live	1
at	1
Sutton?	1
They	1
were	1
eventually	1
released.	1
A	1
man	1
was	1
found	1
strangled,	1
it	1
was	1
said,	1
on	1
the	1
Downs	1
round	1
that	1
part.	1
As	1
a	1
fact,	1
I	1
know	1
(from	1
an	1
Irish	1
policeman	1
who	1
is	1
a	1
friend	1
of	1
mine)	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
found	1
close	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
Epsom	1
Grand	1
Stand--in	1
fact,	1
only	1
hidden	1
by	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
lower	1
doors	1
being	1
pushed	1
back."	1
"That	1
is	1
queer,"	1
assented	1
Flambeau.	1
"But	1
it	1
rather	1
confirms	1
my	1
view	1
that	1
such	1
pleasure	1
places	1
look	1
awfully	1
lonely	1
out	1
of	1
season,	1
or	1
the	1
man	1
wouldn't	1
have	1
been	1
murdered	1
there."	1
"I'm	1
not	1
so	1
sure	1
he--"	1
began	1
Brown,	1
and	1
stopped.	1
"Not	1
so	1
sure	1
he	1
was	1
murdered?"	1
queried	1
his	1
companion.	1
"Not	1
so	1
sure	1
he	1
was	1
murdered	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
season,"	1
answered	1
the	1
little	1
priest,	1
with	1
simplicity.	1
"Don't	1
you	1
think	1
there's	1
something	1
rather	1
tricky	1
about	1
this	1
solitude,	1
Flambeau?	1
Do	1
you	1
feel	1
sure	1
a	1
wise	1
murderer	1
would	1
always	1
want	1
the	1
spot	1
to	1
be	1
lonely?	1
It's	1
very,	1
very	1
seldom	1
a	1
man	1
is	1
quite	1
alone.	1
And,	1
short	1
of	1
that,	1
the	1
more	1
alone	1
he	1
is,	1
the	1
more	1
certain	1
he	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
seen.	1
No;	1
I	1
think	1
there	1
must	1
be	1
some	1
other--Why,	1
here	1
we	1
are	1
at	1
the	1
Pavilion	1
or	1
Palace,	1
or	1
whatever	1
they	1
call	1
it."	1
They	1
had	1
emerged	1
on	1
a	1
small	1
square,	1
brilliantly	1
lighted,	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
principal	1
building	1
was	1
gay	1
with	1
gilding,	1
gaudy	1
with	1
posters,	1
and	1
flanked	1
with	1
two	1
giant	1
photographs	1
of	1
Malvoli	1
and	1
Nigger	1
Ned.	1
"Hallo!"	1
cried	1
Flambeau	1
in	1
great	1
surprise,	1
as	1
his	1
clerical	1
friend	1
stumped	1
straight	1
up	1
the	1
broad	1
steps.	1
"I	1
didn't	1
know	1
pugilism	1
was	1
your	1
latest	1
hobby.	1
Are	1
you	1
going	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
fight?"	1
"I	1
don't	1
think	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
any	1
fight,"	1
replied	1
Father	1
Brown.	1
They	1
passed	1
rapidly	1
through	1
ante-rooms	1
and	1
inner	1
rooms;	1
they	1
passed	1
through	1
the	1
hall	1
of	1
combat	1
itself,	1
raised,	1
roped,	1
and	1
padded	1
with	1
innumerable	1
seats	1
and	1
boxes,	1
and	1
still	1
the	1
cleric	1
did	1
not	1
look	1
round	1
or	1
pause	1
till	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
clerk	1
at	1
a	1
desk	1
outside	1
a	1
door	1
marked	1
"Committee".	1
There	1
he	1
stopped	1
and	1
asked	1
to	1
see	1
Lord	1
Pooley.	1
The	1
attendant	1
observed	1
that	1
his	1
lordship	1
was	1
very	1
busy,	1
as	1
the	1
fight	1
was	1
coming	1
on	1
soon,	1
but	1
Father	1
Brown	1
had	1
a	1
good-tempered	1
tedium	1
of	1
reiteration	1
for	1
which	1
the	1
official	1
mind	1
is	1
generally	1
not	1
prepared.	1
In	1
a	1
few	1
moments	1
the	1
rather	1
baffled	1
Flambeau	1
found	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
was	1
still	1
shouting	1
directions	1
to	1
another	1
man	1
going	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room.	1
"Be	1
careful,	1
you	1
know,	1
about	1
the	1
ropes	1
after	1
the	1
fourth--	1
Well,	1
and	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
want,	1
I	1
wonder!"	1
Lord	1
Pooley	1
was	1
a	1
gentleman,	1
and,	1
like	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
few	1
remaining	1
to	1
our	1
race,	1
was	1
worried--especially	1
about	1
money.	1
He	1
was	1
half	1
grey	1
and	1
half	1
flaxen,	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
fever	1
and	1
a	1
high-bridged,	1
frost-bitten	1
nose.	1
"Only	1
a	1
word,"	1
said	1
Father	1
Brown.	1
"I	1
have	1
come	1
to	1
prevent	1
a	1
man	1
being	1
killed."	1
Lord	1
Pooley	1
bounded	1
off	1
his	1
chair	1
as	1
if	1
a	1
spring	1
had	1
flung	1
him	1
from	1
it.	1
"I'm	1
damned	1
if	1
I'll	1
stand	1
any	1
more	1
of	1
this!"	1
he	1
cried.	1
"You	1
and	1
your	1
committees	1
and	1
parsons	1
and	1
petitions!	1
Weren't	1
there	1
parsons	1
in	1
the	1
old	1
days,	1
when	1
they	1
fought	1
without	1
gloves?	1
Now	1
they're	1
fighting	1
with	1
the	1
regulation	1
gloves,	1
and	1
there's	1
not	1
the	1
rag	1
of	1
a	1
possibility	1
of	1
either	1
of	1
the	1
boxers	1
being	1
killed."	1
"I	1
didn't	1
mean	1
either	1
of	1
the	1
boxers,"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
priest.	1
"Well,	1
well,	1
well!"	1
said	1
the	1
nobleman,	1
with	1
a	1
touch	1
of	1
frosty	1
humour.	1
"Who's	1
going	1
to	1
be	1
killed?	1
The	1
referee?"	1
"I	1
don't	1
know	1
who's	1
going	1
to	1
be	1
killed,"	1
replied	1
Father	1
Brown,	1
with	1
a	1
reflective	1
stare.	1
"If	1
I	1
did	1
I	1
shouldn't	1
have	1
to	1
spoil	1
your	1
pleasure.	1
I	1
could	1
simply	1
get	1
him	1
to	1
escape.	1
I	1
never	1
could	1
see	1
anything	1
wrong	1
about	1
prize-fights.	1
As	1
it	1
is,	1
I	1
must	1
ask	1
you	1
to	1
announce	1
that	1
the	1
fight	1
is	1
off	1
for	1
the	1
present."	1
"Anything	1
else?"	1
jeered	1
the	1
gentleman	1
with	1
feverish	1
eyes.	1
"And	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
say	1
to	1
the	1
two	1
thousand	1
people	1
who	1
have	1
come	1
to	1
see	1
it?"	1
"I	1
say	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
one	1
thousand	1
nine-hundred	1
and	1
ninety-nine	1
of	1
them	1
left	1
alive	1
when	1
they	1
have	1
seen	1
it,"	1
said	1
Father	1
Brown.	1
Lord	1
Pooley	1
looked	1
at	1
Flambeau.	1
"Is	1
your	1
friend	1
mad?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
"Far	1
from	1
it,"	1
was	1
the	1
reply.	1
"And	1
took	1
here,"	1
resumed	1
Pooley	1
in	1
his	1
restless	1
way,	1
"it's	1
worse	1
than	1
that.	1
A	1
whole	1
pack	1
of	1
Italians	1
have	1
turned	1
up	1
to	1
back	1
Malvoli--swarthy,	1
savage	1
fellows	1
of	1
some	1
country,	1
anyhow.	1
You	1
know	1
what	1
these	1
Mediterranean	1
races	1
are	1
like.	1
If	1
I	1
send	1
out	1
word	1
that	1
it's	1
off	1
we	1
shall	1
have	1
Malvoli	1
storming	1
in	1
here	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
a	1
whole	1
Corsican	1
clan."	1
"My	1
lord,	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
death,"	1
said	1
the	1
priest.	1
"Ring	1
your	1
bell.	1
Give	1
your	1
message.	1
And	1
see	1
whether	1
it	1
is	1
Malvoli	1
who	1
answers."	1
The	1
nobleman	1
struck	1
the	1
bell	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
with	1
an	1
odd	1
air	1
of	1
new	1
curiosity.	1
He	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
clerk	1
who	1
appeared	1
almost	1
instantly	1
in	1
the	1
doorway:	1
"I	1
have	1
a	1
serious	1
announcement	1
to	1
make	1
to	1
the	1
audience	1
shortly.	1
Meanwhile,	1
would	1
you	1
kindly	1
tell	1
the	1
two	1
champions	1
that	1
the	1
fight	1
will	1
have	1
to	1
be	1
put	1
off."	1
The	1
clerk	1
stared	1
for	1
some	1
seconds	1
as	1
if	1
at	1
a	1
demon	1
and	1
vanished.	1
"What	1
authority	1
have	1
you	1
for	1
what	1
you	1
say?"	1
asked	1
Lord	1
Pooley	1
abruptly.	1
"Whom	1
did	1
you	1
consult?"	1
"I	1
consulted	1
a	1
bandstand,"	1
said	1
Father	1
Brown,	1
scratching	1
his	1
head.	1
"But,	1
no,	1
I'm	1
wrong;	1
I	1
consulted	1
a	1
book,	1
too.	1
I	1
picked	1
it	1
up	1
on	1
a	1
bookstall	1
in	1
London--very	1
cheap,	1
too."	1
He	1
had	1
taken	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
pocket	1
a	1
small,	1
stout,	1
leather-bound	1
volume,	1
and	1
Flambeau,	1
looking	1
over	1
his	1
shoulder,	1
could	1
see	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
some	1
book	1
of	1
old	1
travels,	1
and	1
had	1
a	1
leaf	1
turned	1
down	1
for	1
reference.	1
"`The	1
only	1
form	1
in	1
which	1
Voodoo--'"	1
began	1
Father	1
Brown,	1
reading	1
aloud.	1
"In	1
which	1
what?"	1
inquired	1
his	1
lordship.	1
"`In	1
which	1
Voodoo,'"	1
repeated	1
the	1
reader,	1
almost	1
with	1
relish,	1
"`is	1
widely	1
organized	1
outside	1
Jamaica	1
itself	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
form	1
known	1
as	1
the	1
Monkey,	1
or	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
the	1
Gongs,	1
which	1
is	1
powerful	1
in	1
many	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
American	1
continents,	1
especially	1
among	1
half-breeds,	1
many	1
of	1
whom	1
look	1
exactly	1
like	1
white	1
men.	1
It	1
differs	1
from	1
most	1
other	1
forms	1
of	1
devil-worship	1
and	1
human	1
sacrifice	1
in	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
blood	1
is	1
not	1
shed	1
formally	1
on	1
the	1
altar,	1
but	1
by	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
assassination	1
among	1
the	1
crowd.	1
The	1
gongs	1
beat	1
with	1
a	1
deafening	1
din	1
as	1
the	1
doors	1
of	1
the	1
shrine	1
open	1
and	1
the	1
monkey-god	1
is	1
revealed;	1
almost	1
the	1
whole	1
congregation	1
rivet	1
ecstatic	1
eyes	1
on	1
him.	1
But	1
after--'"	1
The	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
was	1
flung	1
open,	1
and	1
the	1
fashionable	1
negro	1
stood	1
framed	1
in	1
it,	1
his	1
eyeballs	1
rolling,	1
his	1
silk	1
hat	1
still	1
insolently	1
tilted	1
on	1
his	1
head.	1
"Huh!"	1
he	1
cried,	1
showing	1
his	1
apish	1
teeth.	1
"What	1
this?	1
Huh!	1
Huh!	1
You	1
steal	1
a	1
coloured	1
gentleman's	1
prize--	1
prize	1
his	1
already--yo'	1
think	1
yo'	1
jes'	1
save	1
that	1
white	1
'Talian	1
trash--"	1
"The	1
matter	1
is	1
only	1
deferred,"	1
said	1
the	1
nobleman	1
quietly.	1
"I	1
will	1
be	1
with	1
you	1
to	1
explain	1
in	1
a	1
minute	1
or	1
two."	1
"Who	1
you	1
to--"	1
shouted	1
Nigger	1
Ned,	1
beginning	1
to	1
storm.	1
"My	1
name	1
is	1
Pooley,"	1
replied	1
the	1
other,	1
with	1
a	1
creditable	1
coolness.	1
"I	1
am	1
the	1
organizing	1
secretary,	1
and	1
I	1
advise	1
you	1
just	1
now	1
to	1
leave	1
the	1
room."	1
"Who	1
this	1
fellow?"	1
demanded	1
the	1
dark	1
champion,	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
priest	1
disdainfully.	1
"My	1
name	1
is	1
Brown,"	1
was	1
the	1
reply.	1
"And	1
I	1
advise	1
you	1
just	1
now	1
to	1
leave	1
the	1
country."	1
The	1
prize-fighter	1
stood	1
glaring	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
seconds,	1
and	1
then,	1
rather	1
to	1
the	1
surprise	1
of	1
Flambeau	1
and	1
the	1
others,	1
strode	1
out,	1
sending	1
the	1
door	1
to	1
with	1
a	1
crash	1
behind	1
him.	1
"Well,"	1
asked	1
Father	1
Brown	1
rubbing	1
his	1
dusty	1
hair	1
up,	1
"what	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
of	1
Leonardo	1
da	1
Vinci?	1
A	1
beautiful	1
Italian	1
head."	1
"Look	1
here,"	1
said	1
Lord	1
Pooley,	1
"I've	1
taken	1
a	1
considerable	1
responsibility,	1
on	1
your	1
bare	1
word.	1
I	1
think	1
you	1
ought	1
to	1
tell	1
me	1
more	1
about	1
this."	1
"You	1
are	1
quite	1
right,	1
my	1
lord,"	1
answered	1
Brown.	1
"And	1
it	1
won't	1
take	1
long	1
to	1
tell."	1
He	1
put	1
the	1
little	1
leather	1
book	1
in	1
his	1
overcoat	1
pocket.	1
"I	1
think	1
we	1
know	1
all	1
that	1
this	1
can	1
tell	1
us,	1
but	1
you	1
shall	1
look	1
at	1
it	1
to	1
see	1
if	1
I'm	1
right.	1
That	1
negro	1
who	1
has	1
just	1
swaggered	1
out	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
dangerous	1
men	1
on	1
earth,	1
for	1
he	1
has	1
the	1
brains	1
of	1
a	1
European,	1
with	1
the	1
instincts	1
of	1
a	1
cannibal.	1
He	1
has	1
turned	1
what	1
was	1
clean,	1
common-sense	1
butchery	1
among	1
his	1
fellow-barbarians	1
into	1
a	1
very	1
modern	1
and	1
scientific	1
secret	1
society	1
of	1
assassins.	1
He	1
doesn't	1
know	1
I	1
know	1
it,	1
nor,	1
for	1
the	1
matter	1
of	1
that,	1
that	1
I	1
can't	1
prove	1
it."	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
silence,	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
man	1
went	1
on.	1
"But	1
if	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
murder	1
somebody,	1
will	1
it	1
really	1
be	1
the	1
best	1
plan	1
to	1
make	1
sure	1
I'm	1
alone	1
with	1
him?"	1
Lord	1
Pooley's	1
eyes	1
recovered	1
their	1
frosty	1
twinkle	1
as	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
little	1
clergyman.	1
He	1
only	1
said:	1
"If	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
murder	1
somebody,	1
I	1
should	1
advise	1
it."	1
Father	1
Brown	1
shook	1
his	1
head,	1
like	1
a	1
murderer	1
of	1
much	1
riper	1
experience.	1
"So	1
Flambeau	1
said,"	1
he	1
replied,	1
with	1
a	1
sigh.	1
"But	1
consider.	1
The	1
more	1
a	1
man	1
feels	1
lonely	1
the	1
less	1
he	1
can	1
be	1
sure	1
he	1
is	1
alone.	1
It	1
must	1
mean	1
empty	1
spaces	1
round	1
him,	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
just	1
what	1
make	1
him	1
obvious.	1
Have	1
you	1
never	1
seen	1
one	1
ploughman	1
from	1
the	1
heights,	1
or	1
one	1
shepherd	1
from	1
the	1
valleys?	1
Have	1
you	1
never	1
walked	1
along	1
a	1
cliff,	1
and	1
seen	1
one	1
man	1
walking	1
along	1
the	1
sands?	1
Didn't	1
you	1
know	1
when	1
he's	1
killed	1
a	1
crab,	1
and	1
wouldn't	1
you	1
have	1
known	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
creditor?	1
No!	1
No!	1
No!	1
For	1
an	1
intelligent	1
murderer,	1
such	1
as	1
you	1
or	1
I	1
might	1
be,	1
it	1
is	1
an	1
impossible	1
plan	1
to	1
make	1
sure	1
that	1
nobody	1
is	1
looking	1
at	1
you."	1
"But	1
what	1
other	1
plan	1
is	1
there?"	1
"There	1
is	1
only	1
one,"	1
said	1
the	1
priest.	1
"To	1
make	1
sure	1
that	1
everybody	1
is	1
looking	1
at	1
something	1
else.	1
A	1
man	1
is	1
throttled	1
close	1
by	1
the	1
big	1
stand	1
at	1
Epsom.	1
Anybody	1
might	1
have	1
seen	1
it	1
done	1
while	1
the	1
stand	1
stood	1
empty--any	1
tramp	1
under	1
the	1
hedges	1
or	1
motorist	1
among	1
the	1
hills.	1
But	1
nobody	1
would	1
have	1
seen	1
it	1
when	1
the	1
stand	1
was	1
crowded	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
ring	1
roaring,	1
when	1
the	1
favourite	1
was	1
coming	1
in	1
first--or	1
wasn't.	1
The	1
twisting	1
of	1
a	1
neck-cloth,	1
the	1
thrusting	1
of	1
a	1
body	1
behind	1
a	1
door	1
could	1
be	1
done	1
in	1
an	1
instant--	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
instant.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
same,	1
of	1
course,"	1
he	1
continued	1
turning	1
to	1
Flambeau,	1
"with	1
that	1
poor	1
fellow	1
under	1
the	1
bandstand.	1
He	1
was	1
dropped	1
through	1
the	1
hole	1
(it	1
wasn't	1
an	1
accidental	1
hole)	1
just	1
at	1
some	1
very	1
dramatic	1
moment	1
of	1
the	1
entertainment,	1
when	1
the	1
bow	1
of	1
some	1
great	1
violinist	1
or	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
some	1
great	1
singer	1
opened	1
or	1
came	1
to	1
its	1
climax.	1
And	1
here,	1
of	1
course,	1
when	1
the	1
knock-out	1
blow	1
came--it	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
the	1
only	1
one.	1
That	1
is	1
the	1
little	1
trick	1
Nigger	1
Ned	1
has	1
adopted	1
from	1
his	1
old	1
God	1
of	1
Gongs."	1
"By	1
the	1
way,	1
Malvoli--"	1
Pooley	1
began.	1
"Malvoli,"	1
said	1
the	1
priest,	1
"has	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
it.	1
I	1
dare	1
say	1
he	1
has	1
some	1
Italians	1
with	1
him,	1
but	1
our	1
amiable	1
friends	1
are	1
not	1
Italians.	1
They	1
are	1
octoroons	1
and	1
African	1
half-bloods	1
of	1
various	1
shades,	1
but	1
I	1
fear	1
we	1
English	1
think	1
all	1
foreigners	1
are	1
much	1
the	1
same	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
they	1
are	1
dark	1
and	1
dirty.	1
Also,"	1
he	1
added,	1
with	1
a	1
smile,	1
"I	1
fear	1
the	1
English	1
decline	1
to	1
draw	1
any	1
fine	1
distinction	1
between	1
the	1
moral	1
character	1
produced	1
by	1
my	1
religion	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
blooms	1
out	1
of	1
Voodoo."	1
The	1
blaze	1
of	1
the	1
spring	1
season	1
had	1
burst	1
upon	1
Seawood,	1
littering	1
its	1
foreshore	1
with	1
famines	1
and	1
bathing-machines,	1
with	1
nomadic	1
preachers	1
and	1
nigger	1
minstrels,	1
before	1
the	1
two	1
friends	1
saw	1
it	1
again,	1
and	1
long	1
before	1
the	1
storm	1
of	1
pursuit	1
after	1
the	1
strange	1
secret	1
society	1
had	1
died	1
away.	1
Almost	1
on	1
every	1
hand	1
the	1
secret	1
of	1
their	1
purpose	1
perished	1
with	1
them.	1
The	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
hotel	1
was	1
found	1
drifting	1
dead	1
on	1
the	1
sea	1
like	1
so	1
much	1
seaweed;	1
his	1
right	1
eye	1
was	1
closed	1
in	1
peace,	1
but	1
his	1
left	1
eye	1
was	1
wide	1
open,	1
and	1
glistened	1
like	1
glass	1
in	1
the	1
moon.	1
Nigger	1
Ned	1
had	1
been	1
overtaken	1
a	1
mile	1
or	1
two	1
away,	1
and	1
murdered	1
three	1
policemen	1
with	1
his	1
closed	1
left	1
hand.	1
The	1
remaining	1
officer	1
was	1
surprised--nay,	1
pained--and	1
the	1
negro	1
got	1
away.	1
But	1
this	1
was	1
enough	1
to	1
set	1
all	1
the	1
English	1
papers	1
in	1
a	1
flame,	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
month	1
or	1
two	1
the	1
main	1
purpose	1
of	1
the	1
British	1
Empire	1
was	1
to	1
prevent	1
the	1
buck	1
nigger	1
(who	1
was	1
so	1
in	1
both	1
senses)	1
escaping	1
by	1
any	1
English	1
port.	1
Persons	1
of	1
a	1
figure	1
remotely	1
reconcilable	1
with	1
his	1
were	1
subjected	1
to	1
quite	1
extraordinary	1
inquisitions,	1
made	1
to	1
scrub	1
their	1
faces	1
before	1
going	1
on	1
board	1
ship,	1
as	1
if	1
each	1
white	1
complexion	1
were	1
made	1
up	1
like	1
a	1
mask,	1
of	1
greasepaint.	1
Every	1
negro	1
in	1
England	1
was	1
put	1
under	1
special	1
regulations	1
and	1
made	1
to	1
report	1
himself;	1
the	1
outgoing	1
ships	1
would	1
no	1
more	1
have	1
taken	1
a	1
nigger	1
than	1
a	1
basilisk.	1
For	1
people	1
had	1
found	1
out	1
how	1
fearful	1
and	1
vast	1
and	1
silent	1
was	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
the	1
savage	1
secret	1
society,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
time	1
Flambeau	1
and	1
Father	1
Brown	1
were	1
leaning	1
on	1
the	1
parade	1
parapet	1
in	1
April,	1
the	1
Black	1
Man	1
meant	1
in	1
England	1
almost	1
what	1
he	1
once	1
meant	1
in	1
Scotland.	1
"He	1
must	1
be	1
still	1
in	1
England,"	1
observed	1
Flambeau,	1
"and	1
horridly	1
well	1
hidden,	1
too.	1
They	1
must	1
have	1
found	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
ports	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
only	1
whitened	1
his	1
face."	1
"You	1
see,	1
he	1
is	1
really	1
a	1
clever	1
man,"	1
said	1
Father	1
Brown	1
apologetically.	1
"And	1
I'm	1
sure	1
he	1
wouldn't	1
whiten	1
his	1
face."	1
"Well,	1
but	1
what	1
would	1
he	1
do?"	1
"I	1
think,"	1
said	1
Father	1
Brown,	1
"he	1
would	1
blacken	1
his	1
face."	1
Flambeau,	1
leaning	1
motionless	1
on	1
the	1
parapet,	1
laughed	1
and	1
said:	1
"My	1
dear	1
fellow!"	1
Father	1
Brown,	1
also	1
leaning	1
motionless	1
on	1
the	1
parapet,	1
moved	1
one	1
finger	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
into	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
the	1
soot-masked	1
niggers	1
singing	1
on	1
the	1
sands.	1
X.	1
The	1
Salad	1
of	1
Colonel	1
Cray	1
FATHER	1
BROWN	1
was	1
walking	1
home	1
from	1
Mass	1
on	1
a	1
white	1
weird	1
morning	1
when	1
the	1
mists	1
were	1
slowly	1
lifting--one	1
of	1
those	1
mornings	1
when	1
the	1
very	1
element	1
of	1
light	1
appears	1
as	1
something	1
mysterious	1
and	1
new.	1
The	1
scattered	1
trees	1
outlined	1
themselves	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
vapour,	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
first	1
drawn	1
in	1
grey	1
chalk	1
and	1
then	1
in	1
charcoal.	1
At	1
yet	1
more	1
distant	1
intervals	1
appeared	1
the	1
houses	1
upon	1
the	1
broken	1
fringe	1
of	1
the	1
suburb;	1
their	1
outlines	1
became	1
clearer	1
and	1
clearer	1
until	1
he	1
recognized	1
many	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
chance	1
acquaintances,	1
and	1
many	1
more	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
whose	1
owners	1
he	1
knew.	1
But	1
all	1
the	1
windows	1
and	1
doors	1
were	1
sealed;	1
none	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
sort	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
up	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
time,	1
or	1
still	1
less	1
on	1
such	1
an	1
errand.	1
But	1
as	1
he	1
passed	1
under	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
one	1
handsome	1
villa	1
with	1
verandas	1
and	1
wide	1
ornate	1
gardens,	1
he	1
heard	1
a	1
noise	1
that	1
made	1
him	1
almost	1
involuntarily	1
stop.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
unmistakable	1
noise	1
of	1
a	1
pistol	1
or	1
carbine	1
or	1
some	1
light	1
firearm	1
discharged;	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
this	1
that	1
puzzled	1
him	1
most.	1
The	1
first	1
full	1
noise	1
was	1
immediately	1
followed	1
by	1
a	1
series	1
of	1
fainter	1
noises--	1
as	1
he	1
counted	1
them,	1
about	1
six.	1
He	1
supposed	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
the	1
echo;	1
but	1
the	1
odd	1
thing	1
was	1
that	1
the	1
echo	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
like	1
the	1
original	1
sound.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
like	1
anything	1
else	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
think	1
of;	1
the	1
three	1
things	1
nearest	1
to	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
noise	1
made	1
by	1
siphons	1
of	1
soda-water,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
many	1
noises	1
made	1
by	1
an	1
animal,	1
and	1
the	1
noise	1
made	1
by	1
a	1
person	1
attempting	1
to	1
conceal	1
laughter.	1
None	1
of	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
make	1
much	1
sense.	1
Father	1
Brown	1
was	1
made	1
of	1
two	1
men.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
action,	1
who	1
was	1
as	1
modest	1
as	1
a	1
primrose	1
and	1
as	1
punctual	1
as	1
a	1
clock;	1
who	1
went	1
his	1
small	1
round	1
of	1
duties	1
and	1
never	1
dreamed	1
of	1
altering	1
it.	1
There	1
was	1
also	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
reflection,	1
who	1
was	1
much	1
simpler	1
but	1
much	1
stronger,	1
who	1
could	1
not	1
easily	1
be	1
stopped;	1
whose	1
thought	1
was	1
always	1
(in	1
the	1
only	1
intelligent	1
sense	1
of	1
the	1
words)	1
free	1
thought.	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
help,	1
even	1
unconsciously,	1
asking	1
himself	1
all	1
the	1
questions	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
asked,	1
and	1
answering	1
as	1
many	1
of	1
them	1
as	1
he	1
could;	1
all	1
that	1
went	1
on	1
like	1
his	1
breathing	1
or	1
circulation.	1
But	1
he	1
never	1
consciously	1
carried	1
his	1
actions	1
outside	1
the	1
sphere	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
duty;	1
and	1
in	1
this	1
case	1
the	1
two	1
attitudes	1
were	1
aptly	1
tested.	1
He	1
was	1
just	1
about	1
to	1
resume	1
his	1
trudge	1
in	1
the	1
twilight,	1
telling	1
himself	1
it	1
was	1
no	1
affair	1
of	1
his,	1
but	1
instinctively	1
twisting	1
and	1
untwisting	1
twenty	1
theories	1
about	1
what	1
the	1
odd	1
noises	1
might	1
mean.	1
Then	1
the	1
grey	1
sky-line	1
brightened	1
into	1
silver,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
broadening	1
light	1
he	1
realized	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
which	1
belonged	1
to	1
an	1
Anglo-Indian	1
Major	1
named	1
Putnam;	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
Major	1
had	1
a	1
native	1
cook	1
from	1
Malta	1
who	1
was	1
of	1
his	1
communion.	1
He	1
also	1
began	1
to	1
remember	1
that	1
pistol-shots	1
are	1
sometimes	1
serious	1
things;	1
accompanied	1
with	1
consequences	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
legitimately	1
concerned.	1
He	1
turned	1
back	1
and	1
went	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
garden	1
gate,	1
making	1
for	1
the	1
front	1
door.	1
Half-way	1
down	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
stood	1
out	1
a	1
projection	1
like	1
a	1
very	1
low	1
shed;	1
it	1
was,	1
as	1
he	1
afterwards	1
discovered,	1
a	1
large	1
dustbin.	1
Round	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
this	1
came	1
a	1
figure,	1
at	1
first	1
a	1
mere	1
shadow	1
in	1
the	1
haze,	1
apparently	1
bending	1
and	1
peering	1
about.	1
Then,	1
coming	1
nearer,	1
it	1
solidified	1
into	1
a	1
figure	1
that	1
was,	1
indeed,	1
rather	1
unusually	1
solid.	1
Major	1
Putnam	1
was	1
a	1
bald-headed,	1
bull-necked	1
man,	1
short	1
and	1
very	1
broad,	1
with	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
rather	1
apoplectic	1
faces	1
that	1
are	1
produced	1
by	1
a	1
prolonged	1
attempt	1
to	1
combine	1
the	1
oriental	1
climate	1
with	1
the	1
occidental	1
luxuries.	1
But	1
the	1
face	1
was	1
a	1
good-humoured	1
one,	1
and	1
even	1
now,	1
though	1
evidently	1
puzzled	1
and	1
inquisitive,	1
wore	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
innocent	1
grin.	1
He	1
had	1
a	1
large	1
palm-leaf	1
hat	1
on	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
his	1
head	1
(suggesting	1
a	1
halo	1
that	1
was	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
appropriate	1
to	1
the	1
face),	1
but	1
otherwise	1
he	1
was	1
clad	1
only	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
vivid	1
suit	1
of	1
striped	1
scarlet	1
and	1
yellow	1
pyjamas;	1
which,	1
though	1
glowing	1
enough	1
to	1
behold,	1
must	1
have	1
been,	1
on	1
a	1
fresh	1
morning,	1
pretty	1
chilly	1
to	1
wear.	1
He	1
had	1
evidently	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
house	1
in	1
a	1
hurry,	1
and	1
the	1
priest	1
was	1
not	1
surprised	1
when	1
he	1
called	1
out	1
without	1
further	1
ceremony:	1
"Did	1
you	1
hear	1
that	1
noise?"	1
"Yes,"	1
answered	1
Father	1
Brown;	1
"I	1
thought	1
I	1
had	1
better	1
look	1
in,	1
in	1
case	1
anything	1
was	1
the	1
matter."	1
The	1
Major	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
rather	1
queerly	1
with	1
his	1
good-humoured	1
gooseberry	1
eyes.	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
the	1
noise	1
was?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
"It	1
sounded	1
like	1
a	1
gun	1
or	1
something,"	1
replied	1
the	1
other,	1
with	1
some	1
hesitation;	1
"but	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
singular	1
sort	1
of	1
echo."	1
The	1
Major	1
was	1
still	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
quietly,	1
but	1
with	1
protruding	1
eyes,	1
when	1
the	1
front	1
door	1
was	1
flung	1
open,	1
releasing	1
a	1
flood	1
of	1
gaslight	1
on	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
fading	1
mist;	1
and	1
another	1
figure	1
in	1
pyjamas	1
sprang	1
or	1
tumbled	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
garden.	1
The	1
figure	1
was	1
much	1
longer,	1
leaner,	1
and	1
more	1
athletic;	1
the	1
pyjamas,	1
though	1
equally	1
tropical,	1
were	1
comparatively	1
tasteful,	1
being	1
of	1
white	1
with	1
a	1
light	1
lemon-yellow	1
stripe.	1
The	1
man	1
was	1
haggard,	1
but	1
handsome,	1
more	1
sunburned	1
than	1
the	1
other;	1
he	1
had	1
an	1
aquiline	1
profile	1
and	1
rather	1
deep-sunken	1
eyes,	1
and	1
a	1
slight	1
air	1
of	1
oddity	1
arising	1
from	1
the	1
combination	1
of	1
coal-black	1
hair	1
with	1
a	1
much	1
lighter	1
moustache.	1
All	1
this	1
Father	1
Brown	1
absorbed	1
in	1
detail	1
more	1
at	1
leisure.	1
For	1
the	1
moment	1
he	1
only	1
saw	1
one	1
thing	1
about	1
the	1
man;	1
which	1
was	1
the	1
revolver	1
in	1
his	1
hand.	1
"Cray!"	1
exclaimed	1
the	1
Major,	1
staring	1
at	1
him;	1
"did	1
you	1
fire	1
that	1
shot?"	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
did,"	1
retorted	1
the	1
black-haired	1
gentleman	1
hotly;	1
"and	1
so	1
would	1
you	1
in	1
my	1
place.	1
If	1
you	1
were	1
chased	1
everywhere	1
by	1
devils	1
and	1
nearly--"	1
The	1
Major	1
seemed	1
to	1
intervene	1
rather	1
hurriedly.	1
"This	1
is	1
my	1
friend	1
Father	1
Brown,"	1
he	1
said.	1
And	1
then	1
to	1
Brown:	1
"I	1
don't	1
know	1
whether	1
you've	1
met	1
Colonel	1
Cray	1
of	1
the	1
Royal	1
Artillery."	1
"I	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
him,	1
of	1
course,"	1
said	1
the	1
priest	1
innocently.	1
"Did	1
you--did	1
you	1
hit	1
anything?"	1
"I	1
thought	1
so,"	1
answered	1
Cray	1
with	1
gravity.	1
"Did	1
he--"	1
asked	1
Major	1
Putnam	1
in	1
a	1
lowered	1
voice,	1
"did	1
he	1
fall	1
or	1
cry	1
out,	1
or	1
anything?"	1
Colonel	1
Cray	1
was	1
regarding	1
his	1
host	1
with	1
a	1
strange	1
and	1
steady	1
stare.	1
"I'll	1
tell	1
you	1
exactly	1
what	1
he	1
did,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"He	1
sneezed."	1
Father	1
Brown's	1
hand	1
went	1
half-way	1
to	1
his	1
head,	1
with	1
the	1
gesture	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
remembering	1
somebody's	1
name.	1
He	1
knew	1
now	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
was	1
neither	1
soda-water	1
nor	1
the	1
snorting	1
of	1
a	1
dog.	1
"Well,"	1
ejaculated	1
the	1
staring	1
Major,	1
"I	1
never	1
heard	1
before	1
that	1
a	1
service	1
revolver	1
was	1
a	1
thing	1
to	1
be	1
sneezed	1
at."	1
"Nor	1
I,"	1
said	1
Father	1
Brown	1
faintly.	1
"It's	1
lucky	1
you	1
didn't	1
turn	1
your	1
artillery	1
on	1
him	1
or	1
you	1
might	1
have	1
given	1
him	1
quite	1
a	1
bad	1
cold."	1
Then,	1
after	1
a	1
bewildered	1
pause,	1
he	1
said:	1
"Was	1
it	1
a	1
burglar?"	1
"Let	1
us	1
go	1
inside,"	1
said	1
Major	1
Putnam,	1
rather	1
sharply,	1
and	1
led	1
the	1
way	1
into	1
his	1
house.	1
The	1
interior	1
exhibited	1
a	1
paradox	1
often	1
to	1
be	1
marked	1
in	1
such	1
morning	1
hours:	1
that	1
the	1
rooms	1
seemed	1
brighter	1
than	1
the	1
sky	1
outside;	1
even	1
after	1
the	1
Major	1
had	1
turned	1
out	1
the	1
one	1
gaslight	1
in	1
the	1
front	1
hall.	1
Father	1
Brown	1
was	1
surprised	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
whole	1
dining-table	1
set	1
out	1
as	1
for	1
a	1
festive	1
meal,	1
with	1
napkins	1
in	1
their	1
rings,	1
and	1
wine-glasses	1
of	1
some	1
six	1
unnecessary	1
shapes	1
set	1
beside	1
every	1
plate.	1
It	1
was	1
common	1
enough,	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
morning,	1
to	1
find	1
the	1
remains	1
of	1
a	1
banquet	1
over-night;	1
but	1
to	1
find	1
it	1
freshly	1
spread	1
so	1
early	1
was	1
unusual.	1
While	1
he	1
stood	1
wavering	1
in	1
the	1
hall	1
Major	1
Putnam	1
rushed	1
past	1
him	1
and	1
sent	1
a	1
raging	1
eye	1
over	1
the	1
whole	1
oblong	1
of	1
the	1
tablecloth.	1
At	1
last	1
he	1
spoke,	1
spluttering:	1
"All	1
the	1
silver	1
gone!"	1
he	1
gasped.	1
"Fish-knives	1
and	1
forks	1
gone.	1
Old	1
cruet-stand	1
gone.	1
Even	1
the	1
old	1
silver	1
cream-jug	1
gone.	1
And	1
now,	1
Father	1
Brown,	1
I	1
am	1
ready	1
to	1
answer	1
your	1
question	1
of	1
whether	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
burglar."	1
"They're	1
simply	1
a	1
blind,"	1
said	1
Cray	1
stubbornly.	1
"I	1
know	1
better	1
than	1
you	1
why	1
people	1
persecute	1
this	1
house;	1
I	1
know	1
better	1
than	1
you	1
why--"	1
The	1
Major	1
patted	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
shoulder	1
with	1
a	1
gesture	1
almost	1
peculiar	1
to	1
the	1
soothing	1
of	1
a	1
sick	1
child,	1
and	1
said:	1
"It	1
was	1
a	1
burglar.	1
Obviously	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
burglar."	1
"A	1
burglar	1
with	1
a	1
bad	1
cold,"	1
observed	1
Father	1
Brown,	1
"that	1
might	1
assist	1
you	1
to	1
trace	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
neighbourhood."	1
The	1
Major	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
in	1
a	1
sombre	1
manner.	1
"He	1
must	1
be	1
far	1
beyond	1
trace	1
now,	1
I	1
fear,"	1
he	1
said.	1
Then,	1
as	1
the	1
restless	1
man	1
with	1
the	1
revolver	1
turned	1
again	1
towards	1
the	1
door	1
in	1
the	1
garden,	1
he	1
added	1
in	1
a	1
husky,	1
confidential	1
voice:	1
"I	1
doubt	1
whether	1
I	1
should	1
send	1
for	1
the	1
police,	1
for	1
fear	1
my	1
friend	1
here	1
has	1
been	1
a	1
little	1
too	1
free	1
with	1
his	1
bullets,	1
and	1
got	1
on	1
the	1
wrong	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
law.	1
He's	1
lived	1
in	1
very	1
wild	1
places;	1
and,	1
to	1
be	1
frank	1
with	1
you,	1
I	1
think	1
he	1
sometimes	1
fancies	1
things."	1
"I	1
think	1
you	1
once	1
told	1
me,"	1
said	1
Brown,	1
"that	1
he	1
believes	1
some	1
Indian	1
secret	1
society	1
is	1
pursuing	1
him."	1
Major	1
Putnam	1
nodded,	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders.	1
"I	1
suppose	1
we'd	1
better	1
follow	1
him	1
outside,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"I	1
don't	1
want	1
any	1
more--shall	1
we	1
say,	1
sneezing?"	1
They	1
passed	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
morning	1
light,	1
which	1
was	1
now	1
even	1
tinged	1
with	1
sunshine,	1
and	1
saw	1
Colonel	1
Cray's	1
tall	1
figure	1
bent	1
almost	1
double,	1
minutely	1
examining	1
the	1
condition	1
of	1
gravel	1
and	1
grass.	1
While	1
the	1
Major	1
strolled	1
unobtrusively	1
towards	1
him,	1
the	1
priest	1
took	1
an	1
equally	1
indolent	1
turn,	1
which	1
took	1
him	1
round	1
the	1
next	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
to	1
within	1
a	1
yard	1
or	1
two	1
of	1
the	1
projecting	1
dustbin.	1
He	1
stood	1
regarding	1
this	1
dismal	1
object	1
for	1
some	1
minute	1
and	1
a	1
half--,	1
then	1
he	1
stepped	1
towards	1
it,	1
lifted	1
the	1
lid	1
and	1
put	1
his	1
head	1
inside.	1
Dust	1
and	1
other	1
discolouring	1
matter	1
shook	1
upwards	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
so;	1
but	1
Father	1
Brown	1
never	1
observed	1
his	1
own	1
appearance,	1
whatever	1
else	1
he	1
observed.	1
He	1
remained	1
thus	1
for	1
a	1
measurable	1
period,	1
as	1
if	1
engaged	1
in	1
some	1
mysterious	1
prayers.	1
Then	1
he	1
came	1
out	1
again,	1
with	1
some	1
ashes	1
on	1
his	1
hair,	1
and	1
walked	1
unconcernedly	1
away.	1
By	1
the	1
time	1
he	1
came	1
round	1
to	1
the	1
garden	1
door	1
again	1
he	1
found	1
a	1
group	1
there	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
roll	1
away	1
morbidities	1
as	1
the	1
sunlight	1
had	1
already	1
rolled	1
away	1
the	1
mists.	1
It	1
was	1
in	1
no	1
way	1
rationally	1
reassuring;	1
it	1
was	1
simply	1
broadly	1
comic,	1
like	1
a	1
cluster	1
of	1
Dickens's	1
characters.	1
Major	1
Putnam	1
had	1
managed	1
to	1
slip	1
inside	1
and	1
plunge	1
into	1
a	1
proper	1
shirt	1
and	1
trousers,	1
with	1
a	1
crimson	1
cummerbund,	1
and	1
a	1
light	1
square	1
jacket	1
over	1
all;	1
thus	1
normally	1
set	1
off,	1
his	1
red	1
festive	1
face	1
seemed	1
bursting	1
with	1
a	1
commonplace	1
cordiality.	1
He	1
was	1
indeed	1
emphatic,	1
but	1
then	1
he	1
was	1
talking	1
to	1
his	1
cook--the	1
swarthy	1
son	1
of	1
Malta,	1
whose	1
lean,	1
yellow	1
and	1
rather	1
careworn	1
face	1
contrasted	1
quaintly	1
with	1
his	1
snow-white	1
cap	1
and	1
costume.	1
The	1
cook	1
might	1
well	1
be	1
careworn,	1
for	1
cookery	1
was	1
the	1
Major's	1
hobby.	1
He	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
amateurs	1
who	1
always	1
know	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
professional.	1
The	1
only	1
other	1
person	1
he	1
even	1
admitted	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
judge	1
of	1
an	1
omelette	1
was	1
his	1
friend	1
Cray--and	1
as	1
Brown	1
remembered	1
this,	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
the	1
other	1
officer.	1
In	1
the	1
new	1
presence	1
of	1
daylight	1
and	1
people	1
clothed	1
and	1
in	1
their	1
right	1
mind,	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
him	1
was	1
rather	1
a	1
shock.	1
The	1
taller	1
and	1
more	1
elegant	1
man	1
was	1
still	1
in	1
his	1
night-garb,	1
with	1
tousled	1
black	1
hair,	1
and	1
now	1
crawling	1
about	1
the	1
garden	1
on	1
his	1
hands	1
and	1
knees,	1
still	1
looking	1
for	1
traces	1
of	1
the	1
burglar;	1
and	1
now	1
and	1
again,	1
to	1
all	1
appearance,	1
striking	1
the	1
ground	1
with	1
his	1
hand	1
in	1
anger	1
at	1
not	1
finding	1
him.	1
Seeing	1
him	1
thus	1
quadrupedal	1
in	1
the	1
grass,	1
the	1
priest	1
raised	1
his	1
eyebrows	1
rather	1
sadly;	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
guessed	1
that	1
"fancies	1
things"	1
might	1
be	1
an	1
euphemism.	1
The	1
third	1
item	1
in	1
the	1
group	1
of	1
the	1
cook	1
and	1
the	1
epicure	1
was	1
also	1
known	1
to	1
Father	1
Brown;	1
it	1
was	1
Audrey	1
Watson,	1
the	1
Major's	1
ward	1
and	1
housekeeper;	1
and	1
at	1
this	1
moment,	1
to	1
judge	1
by	1
her	1
apron,	1
tucked-up	1
sleeves	1
and	1
resolute	1
manner,	1
much	1
more	1
the	1
housekeeper	1
than	1
the	1
ward.	1
"It	1
serves	1
you	1
right,"	1
she	1
was	1
saying:	1
"I	1
always	1
told	1
you	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
that	1
old-fashioned	1
cruet-stand."	1
"I	1
prefer	1
it,"	1
said	1
Putnam,	1
placably.	1
"I'm	1
old-fashioned	1
myself;	1
and	1
the	1
things	1
keep	1
together."	1
"And	1
vanish	1
together,	1
as	1
you	1
see,"	1
she	1
retorted.	1
"Well,	1
if	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
going	1
to	1
bother	1
about	1
the	1
burglar,	1
I	1
shouldn't	1
bother	1
about	1
the	1
lunch.	1
It's	1
Sunday,	1
and	1
we	1
can't	1
send	1
for	1
vinegar	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
town;	1
and	1
you	1
Indian	1
gentlemen	1
can't	1
enjoy	1
what	1
you	1
call	1
a	1
dinner	1
without	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
hot	1
things.	1
I	1
wish	1
to	1
goodness	1
now	1
you	1
hadn't	1
asked	1
Cousin	1
Oliver	1
to	1
take	1
me	1
to	1
the	1
musical	1
service.	1
It	1
isn't	1
over	1
till	1
half-past	1
twelve,	1
and	1
the	1
Colonel	1
has	1
to	1
leave	1
by	1
then.	1
I	1
don't	1
believe	1
you	1
men	1
can	1
manage	1
alone."	1
"Oh	1
yes,	1
we	1
can,	1
my	1
dear,"	1
said	1
the	1
Major,	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
very	1
amiably.	1
"Marco	1
has	1
all	1
the	1
sauces,	1
and	1
we've	1
often	1
done	1
ourselves	1
well	1
in	1
very	1
rough	1
places,	1
as	1
you	1
might	1
know	1
by	1
now.	1
And	1
it's	1
time	1
you	1
had	1
a	1
treat,	1
Audrey;	1
you	1
mustn't	1
be	1
a	1
housekeeper	1
every	1
hour	1
of	1
the	1
day;	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
music."	1
"I	1
want	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
church,"	1
she	1
said,	1
with	1
rather	1
severe	1
eyes.	1
She	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
handsome	1
women	1
who	1
will	1
always	1
be	1
handsome,	1
because	1
the	1
beauty	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
an	1
air	1
or	1
a	1
tint,	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
structure	1
of	1
the	1
head	1
and	1
features.	1
But	1
though	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
yet	1
middle-aged	1
and	1
her	1
auburn	1
hair	1
was	1
of	1
a	1
Titianesque	1
fullness	1
in	1
form	1
and	1
colour,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
look	1
in	1
her	1
mouth	1
and	1
around	1
her	1
eyes	1
which	1
suggested	1
that	1
some	1
sorrows	1
wasted	1
her,	1
as	1
winds	1
waste	1
at	1
last	1
the	1
edges	1
of	1
a	1
Greek	1
temple.	1
For	1
indeed	1
the	1
little	1
domestic	1
difficulty	1
of	1
which	1
she	1
was	1
now	1
speaking	1
so	1
decisively	1
was	1
rather	1
comic	1
than	1
tragic.	1
Father	1
Brown	1
gathered,	1
from	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
the	1
conversation,	1
that	1
Cray,	1
the	1
other	1
gourmet,	1
had	1
to	1
leave	1
before	1
the	1
usual	1
lunch-time;	1
but	1
that	1
Putnam,	1
his	1
host,	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
final	1
feast	1
with	1
an	1
old	1
crony,	1
had	1
arranged	1
for	1
a	1
special	1
dejeuner	1
to	1
be	1
set	1
out	1
and	1
consumed	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
the	1
morning,	1
while	1
Audrey	1
and	1
other	1
graver	1
persons	1
were	1
at	1
morning	1
service.	1
She	1
was	1
going	1
there	1
under	1
the	1
escort	1
of	1
a	1
relative	1
and	1
old	1
friend	1
of	1
hers,	1
Dr	1
Oliver	1
Oman,	1
who,	1
though	1
a	1
scientific	1
man	1
of	1
a	1
somewhat	1
bitter	1
type,	1
was	1
enthusiastic	1
for	1
music,	1
and	1
would	1
go	1
even	1
to	1
church	1
to	1
get	1
it.	1
There	1
was	1
nothing	1
in	1
all	1
this	1
that	1
could	1
conceivably	1
concern	1
the	1
tragedy	1
in	1
Miss	1
Watson's	1
face;	1
and	1
by	1
a	1
half	1
conscious	1
instinct,	1
Father	1
Brown	1
turned	1
again	1
to	1
the	1
seeming	1
lunatic	1
grubbing	1
about	1
in	1
the	1
grass.	1
When	1
he	1
strolled	1
across	1
to	1
him,	1
the	1
black,	1
unbrushed	1
head	1
was	1
lifted	1
abruptly,	1
as	1
if	1
in	1
some	1
surprise	1
at	1
his	1
continued	1
presence.	1
And	1
indeed,	1
Father	1
Brown,	1
for	1
reasons	1
best	1
known	1
to	1
himself,	1
had	1
lingered	1
much	1
longer	1
than	1
politeness	1
required;	1
or	1
even,	1
in	1
the	1
ordinary	1
sense,	1
permitted.	1
"Well!"	1
cried	1
Cray,	1
with	1
wild	1
eyes.	1
"I	1
suppose	1
you	1
think	1
I'm	1
mad,	1
like	1
the	1
rest?"	1
"I	1
have	1
considered	1
the	1
thesis,"	1
answered	1
the	1
little	1
man,	1
composedly.	1
"And	1
I	1
incline	1
to	1
think	1
you	1
are	1
not."	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
mean?"	1
snapped	1
Cray	1
quite	1
savagely.	1
"Real	1
madmen,"	1
explained	1
Father	1
Brown,	1
"always	1
encourage	1
their	1
own	1
morbidity.	1
They	1
never	1
strive	1
against	1
it.	1
But	1
you	1
are	1
trying	1
to	1
find	1
traces	1
of	1
the	1
burglar;	1
even	1
when	1
there	1
aren't	1
any.	1
You	1
are	1
struggling	1
against	1
it.	1
You	1
want	1
what	1
no	1
madman	1
ever	1
wants."	1
"And	1
what	1
is	1
that?"	1
"You	1
want	1
to	1
be	1
proved	1
wrong,"	1
said	1
Brown.	1
During	1
the	1
last	1
words	1
Cray	1
had	1
sprung	1
or	1
staggered	1
to	1
his	1
feet	1
and	1
was	1
regarding	1
the	1
cleric	1
with	1
agitated	1
eyes.	1
"By	1
hell,	1
but	1
that	1
is	1
a	1
true	1
word!"	1
he	1
cried.	1
"They	1
are	1
all	1
at	1
me	1
here	1
that	1
the	1
fellow	1
was	1
only	1
after	1
the	1
silver--as	1
if	1
I	1
shouldn't	1
be	1
only	1
too	1
pleased	1
to	1
think	1
so!	1
She's	1
been	1
at	1
me,"	1
and	1
he	1
tossed	1
his	1
tousled	1
black	1
head	1
towards	1
Audrey,	1
but	1
the	1
other	1
had	1
no	1
need	1
of	1
the	1
direction,	1
"she's	1
been	1
at	1
me	1
today	1
about	1
how	1
cruel	1
I	1
was	1
to	1
shoot	1
a	1
poor	1
harmless	1
house-breaker,	1
and	1
how	1
I	1
have	1
the	1
devil	1
in	1
me	1
against	1
poor	1
harmless	1
natives.	1
But	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
good-natured	1
man	1
once--as	1
good-natured	1
as	1
Putnam."	1
After	1
a	1
pause	1
he	1
said:	1
"Look	1
here,	1
I've	1
never	1
seen	1
you	1
before;	1
but	1
you	1
shall	1
judge	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
story.	1
Old	1
Putnam	1
and	1
I	1
were	1
friends	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
mess;	1
but,	1
owing	1
to	1
some	1
accidents	1
on	1
the	1
Afghan	1
border,	1
I	1
got	1
my	1
command	1
much	1
sooner	1
than	1
most	1
men;	1
only	1
we	1
were	1
both	1
invalided	1
home	1
for	1
a	1
bit.	1
I	1
was	1
engaged	1
to	1
Audrey	1
out	1
there;	1
and	1
we	1
all	1
travelled	1
back	1
together.	1
But	1
on	1
the	1
journey	1
back	1
things	1
happened.	1
Curious	1
things.	1
The	1
result	1
of	1
them	1
was	1
that	1
Putnam	1
wants	1
it	1
broken	1
off,	1
and	1
even	1
Audrey	1
keeps	1
it	1
hanging	1
on--	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
what	1
they	1
mean.	1
I	1
know	1
what	1
they	1
think	1
I	1
am.	1
So	1
do	1
you.	1
"Well,	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
facts.	1
The	1
last	1
day	1
we	1
were	1
in	1
an	1
Indian	1
city	1
I	1
asked	1
Putnam	1
if	1
I	1
could	1
get	1
some	1
Trichinopoli	1
cigars,	1
he	1
directed	1
me	1
to	1
a	1
little	1
place	1
opposite	1
his	1
lodgings.	1
I	1
have	1
since	1
found	1
he	1
was	1
quite	1
right;	1
but	1
`opposite'	1
is	1
a	1
dangerous	1
word	1
when	1
one	1
decent	1
house	1
stands	1
opposite	1
five	1
or	1
six	1
squalid	1
ones;	1
and	1
I	1
must	1
have	1
mistaken	1
the	1
door.	1
It	1
opened	1
with	1
difficulty,	1
and	1
then	1
only	1
on	1
darkness;	1
but	1
as	1
I	1
turned	1
back,	1
the	1
door	1
behind	1
me	1
sank	1
back	1
and	1
settled	1
into	1
its	1
place	1
with	1
a	1
noise	1
as	1
of	1
innumerable	1
bolts.	1
There	1
was	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
but	1
to	1
walk	1
forward;	1
which	1
I	1
did	1
through	1
passage	1
after	1
passage,	1
pitch-dark.	1
Then	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
flight	1
of	1
steps,	1
and	1
then	1
to	1
a	1
blind	1
door,	1
secured	1
by	1
a	1
latch	1
of	1
elaborate	1
Eastern	1
ironwork,	1
which	1
I	1
could	1
only	1
trace	1
by	1
touch,	1
but	1
which	1
I	1
loosened	1
at	1
last.	1
I	1
came	1
out	1
again	1
upon	1
gloom,	1
which	1
was	1
half	1
turned	1
into	1
a	1
greenish	1
twilight	1
by	1
a	1
multitude	1
of	1
small	1
but	1
steady	1
lamps	1
below.	1
They	1
showed	1
merely	1
the	1
feet	1
or	1
fringes	1
of	1
some	1
huge	1
and	1
empty	1
architecture.	1
Just	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
me	1
was	1
something	1
that	1
looked	1
like	1
a	1
mountain.	1
I	1
confess	1
I	1
nearly	1
fell	1
on	1
the	1
great	1
stone	1
platform	1
on	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
emerged,	1
to	1
realize	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
an	1
idol.	1
And	1
worst	1
of	1
all,	1
an	1
idol	1
with	1
its	1
back	1
to	1
me.	1
"It	1
was	1
hardly	1
half	1
human,	1
I	1
guessed;	1
to	1
judge	1
by	1
the	1
small	1
squat	1
head,	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
by	1
a	1
thing	1
like	1
a	1
tail	1
or	1
extra	1
limb	1
turned	1
up	1
behind	1
and	1
pointing,	1
like	1
a	1
loathsome	1
large	1
finger,	1
at	1
some	1
symbol	1
graven	1
in	1
the	1
centre	1
of	1
the	1
vast	1
stone	1
back.	1
I	1
had	1
begun,	1
in	1
the	1
dim	1
light,	1
to	1
guess	1
at	1
the	1
hieroglyphic,	1
not	1
without	1
horror,	1
when	1
a	1
more	1
horrible	1
thing	1
happened.	1
A	1
door	1
opened	1
silently	1
in	1
the	1
temple	1
wall	1
behind	1
me	1
and	1
a	1
man	1
came	1
out,	1
with	1
a	1
brown	1
face	1
and	1
a	1
black	1
coat.	1
He	1
had	1
a	1
carved	1
smile	1
on	1
his	1
face,	1
of	1
copper	1
flesh	1
and	1
ivory	1
teeth;	1
but	1
I	1
think	1
the	1
most	1
hateful	1
thing	1
about	1
him	1
was	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
European	1
dress.	1
I	1
was	1
prepared,	1
I	1
think,	1
for	1
shrouded	1
priests	1
or	1
naked	1
fakirs.	1
But	1
this	1
seemed	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
the	1
devilry	1
was	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
earth.	1
As	1
indeed	1
I	1
found	1
it	1
to	1
be.	1
"`If	1
you	1
had	1
only	1
seen	1
the	1
Monkey's	1
Feet,'	1
he	1
said,	1
smiling	1
steadily,	1
and	1
without	1
other	1
preface,	1
`we	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
very	1
gentle--	1
you	1
would	1
only	1
be	1
tortured	1
and	1
die.	1
If	1
you	1
had	1
seen	1
the	1
Monkey's	1
Face,	1
still	1
we	1
should	1
be	1
very	1
moderate,	1
very	1
tolerant--you	1
would	1
only	1
be	1
tortured	1
and	1
live.	1
But	1
as	1
you	1
have	1
seen	1
the	1
Monkey's	1
Tail,	1
we	1
must	1
pronounce	1
the	1
worst	1
sentence.	1
which	1
is--Go	1
Free.'	1
"When	1
he	1
said	1
the	1
words	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
elaborate	1
iron	1
latch	1
with	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
struggled,	1
automatically	1
unlock	1
itself:	1
and	1
then,	1
far	1
down	1
the	1
dark	1
passages	1
I	1
had	1
passed,	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
heavy	1
street-door	1
shifting	1
its	1
own	1
bolts	1
backwards.	1
"`It	1
is	1
vain	1
to	1
ask	1
for	1
mercy;	1
you	1
must	1
go	1
free,'	1
said	1
the	1
smiling	1
man.	1
`Henceforth	1
a	1
hair	1
shall	1
slay	1
you	1
like	1
a	1
sword,	1
and	1
a	1
breath	1
shall	1
bite	1
you	1
like	1
an	1
adder;	1
weapons	1
shall	1
come	1
against	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
nowhere;	1
and	1
you	1
shall	1
die	1
many	1
times.'	1
And	1
with	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
swallowed	1
once	1
more	1
in	1
the	1
wall	1
behind;	1
and	1
I	1
went	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
street."	1
Cray	1
paused;	1
and	1
Father	1
Brown	1
unaffectedly	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
lawn	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
pick	1
daisies.	1
Then	1
the	1
soldier	1
continued:	1
"Putnam,	1
of	1
course,	1
with	1
his	1
jolly	1
common	1
sense,	1
pooh-poohed	1
all	1
my	1
fears;	1
and	1
from	1
that	1
time	1
dates	1
his	1
doubt	1
of	1
my	1
mental	1
balance.	1
Well,	1
I'll	1
simply	1
tell	1
you,	1
in	1
the	1
fewest	1
words,	1
the	1
three	1
things	1
that	1
have	1
happened	1
since;	1
and	1
you	1
shall	1
judge	1
which	1
of	1
us	1
is	1
right.	1
"The	1
first	1
happened	1
in	1
an	1
Indian	1
village	1
on	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
jungle,	1
but	1
hundreds	1
of	1
miles	1
from	1
the	1
temple,	1
or	1
town,	1
or	1
type	1
of	1
tribes	1
and	1
customs	1
where	1
the	1
curse	1
had	1
been	1
put	1
on	1
me.	1
I	1
woke	1
in	1
black	1
midnight,	1
and	1
lay	1
thinking	1
of	1
nothing	1
in	1
particular,	1
when	1
I	1
felt	1
a	1
faint	1
tickling	1
thing,	1
like	1
a	1
thread	1
or	1
a	1
hair,	1
trailed	1
across	1
my	1
throat.	1
I	1
shrank	1
back	1
out	1
of	1
its	1
way,	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
thinking	1
of	1
the	1
words	1
in	1
the	1
temple.	1
But	1
when	1
I	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
sought	1
lights	1
and	1
a	1
mirror,	1
the	1
line	1
across	1
my	1
neck	1
was	1
a	1
line	1
of	1
blood.	1
"The	1
second	1
happened	1
in	1
a	1
lodging	1
in	1
Port	1
Said,	1
later,	1
on	1
our	1
journey	1
home	1
together.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
jumble	1
of	1
tavern	1
and	1
curiosity-shop;	1
and	1
though	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
there	1
remotely	1
suggesting	1
the	1
cult	1
of	1
the	1
Monkey,	1
it	1
is,	1
of	1
course,	1
possible	1
that	1
some	1
of	1
its	1
images	1
or	1
talismans	1
were	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
place.	1
Its	1
curse	1
was	1
there,	1
anyhow.	1
I	1
woke	1
again	1
in	1
the	1
dark	1
with	1
a	1
sensation	1
that	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
put	1
in	1
colder	1
or	1
more	1
literal	1
words	1
than	1
that	1
a	1
breath	1
bit	1
like	1
an	1
adder.	1
Existence	1
was	1
an	1
agony	1
of	1
extinction;	1
I	1
dashed	1
my	1
head	1
against	1
walls	1
until	1
I	1
dashed	1
it	1
against	1
a	1
window;	1
and	1
fell	1
rather	1
than	1
jumped	1
into	1
the	1
garden	1
below.	1
Putnam,	1
poor	1
fellow,	1
who	1
had	1
called	1
the	1
other	1
thing	1
a	1
chance	1
scratch,	1
was	1
bound	1
to	1
take	1
seriously	1
the	1
fact	1
of	1
finding	1
me	1
half	1
insensible	1
on	1
the	1
grass	1
at	1
dawn.	1
But	1
I	1
fear	1
it	1
was	1
my	1
mental	1
state	1
he	1
took	1
seriously;	1
and	1
not	1
my	1
story.	1
"The	1
third	1
happened	1
in	1
Malta.	1
We	1
were	1
in	1
a	1
fortress	1
there;	1
and	1
as	1
it	1
happened	1
our	1
bedrooms	1
overlooked	1
the	1
open	1
sea,	1
which	1
almost	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
our	1
window-sills,	1
save	1
for	1
a	1
flat	1
white	1
outer	1
wall	1
as	1
bare	1
as	1
the	1
sea.	1
I	1
woke	1
up	1
again;	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
dark.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
full	1
moon,	1
as	1
I	1
walked	1
to	1
the	1
window;	1
I	1
could	1
have	1
seen	1
a	1
bird	1
on	1
the	1
bare	1
battlement,	1
or	1
a	1
sail	1
on	1
the	1
horizon.	1
What	1
I	1
did	1
see	1
was	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
stick	1
or	1
branch	1
circling,	1
self-supported,	1
in	1
the	1
empty	1
sky.	1
It	1
flew	1
straight	1
in	1
at	1
my	1
window	1
and	1
smashed	1
the	1
lamp	1
beside	1
the	1
pillow	1
I	1
had	1
just	1
quitted.	1
It	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
queer-shaped	1
war-clubs	1
some	1
Eastern	1
tribes	1
use.	1
But	1
it	1
had	1
come	1
from	1
no	1
human	1
hand."	1
Father	1
Brown	1
threw	1
away	1
a	1
daisy-chain	1
he	1
was	1
making,	1
and	1
rose	1
with	1
a	1
wistful	1
look.	1
"Has	1
Major	1
Putnam,"	1
he	1
asked,	1
"got	1
any	1
Eastern	1
curios,	1
idols,	1
weapons	1
and	1
so	1
on,	1
from	1
which	1
one	1
might	1
get	1
a	1
hint?"	1
"Plenty	1
of	1
those,	1
though	1
not	1
much	1
use,	1
I	1
fear,"	1
replied	1
Cray;	1
"but	1
by	1
all	1
means	1
come	1
into	1
his	1
study."	1
As	1
they	1
entered	1
they	1
passed	1
Miss	1
Watson	1
buttoning	1
her	1
gloves	1
for	1
church,	1
and	1
heard	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
Putnam	1
downstairs	1
still	1
giving	1
a	1
lecture	1
on	1
cookery	1
to	1
the	1
cook.	1
In	1
the	1
Major's	1
study	1
and	1
den	1
of	1
curios	1
they	1
came	1
suddenly	1
on	1
a	1
third	1
party,	1
silk-hatted	1
and	1
dressed	1
for	1
the	1
street,	1
who	1
was	1
poring	1
over	1
an	1
open	1
book	1
on	1
the	1
smoking-table--a	1
book	1
which	1
he	1
dropped	1
rather	1
guiltily,	1
and	1
turned.	1
Cray	1
introduced	1
him	1
civilly	1
enough,	1
as	1
Dr	1
Oman,	1
but	1
he	1
showed	1
such	1
disfavour	1
in	1
his	1
very	1
face	1
that	1
Brown	1
guessed	1
the	1
two	1
men,	1
whether	1
Audrey	1
knew	1
it	1
or	1
not,	1
were	1
rivals.	1
Nor	1
was	1
the	1
priest	1
wholly	1
unsympathetic	1
with	1
the	1
prejudice.	1
Dr	1
Oman	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
well-dressed	1
gentleman	1
indeed;	1
well-featured,	1
though	1
almost	1
dark	1
enough	1
for	1
an	1
Asiatic.	1
But	1
Father	1
Brown	1
had	1
to	1
tell	1
himself	1
sharply	1
that	1
one	1
should	1
be	1
in	1
charity	1
even	1
with	1
those	1
who	1
wax	1
their	1
pointed	1
beards,	1
who	1
have	1
small	1
gloved	1
hands,	1
and	1
who	1
speak	1
with	1
perfectly	1
modulated	1
voices.	1
Cray	1
seemed	1
to	1
find	1
something	1
specially	1
irritating	1
in	1
the	1
small	1
prayer-book	1
in	1
Oman's	1
dark-gloved	1
hand.	1
"I	1
didn't	1
know	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
your	1
line,"	1
he	1
said	1
rather	1
rudely.	1
Oman	1
laughed	1
mildly,	1
but	1
without	1
offence.	1
"This	1
is	1
more	1
so,	1
I	1
know,"	1
he	1
said,	1
laying	1
his	1
hand	1
on	1
the	1
big	1
book	1
he	1
had	1
dropped,	1
"a	1
dictionary	1
of	1
drugs	1
and	1
such	1
things.	1
But	1
it's	1
rather	1
too	1
large	1
to	1
take	1
to	1
church."	1
Then	1
he	1
closed	1
the	1
larger	1
book,	1
and	1
there	1
seemed	1
again	1
the	1
faintest	1
touch	1
of	1
hurry	1
and	1
embarrassment.	1
"I	1
suppose,"	1
said	1
the	1
priest,	1
who	1
seemed	1
anxious	1
to	1
change	1
the	1
subject,	1
"all	1
these	1
spears	1
and	1
things	1
are	1
from	1
India?"	1
"From	1
everywhere,"	1
answered	1
the	1
doctor.	1
"Putnam	1
is	1
an	1
old	1
soldier,	1
and	1
has	1
been	1
in	1
Mexico	1
and	1
Australia,	1
and	1
the	1
Cannibal	1
Islands	1
for	1
all	1
I	1
know."	1
"I	1
hope	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
Cannibal	1
Islands,"	1
said	1
Brown,	1
"that	1
he	1
learnt	1
the	1
art	1
of	1
cookery."	1
And	1
he	1
ran	1
his	1
eyes	1
over	1
the	1
stew-pots	1
or	1
other	1
strange	1
utensils	1
on	1
the	1
wall.	1
At	1
this	1
moment	1
the	1
jolly	1
subject	1
of	1
their	1
conversation	1
thrust	1
his	1
laughing,	1
lobsterish	1
face	1
into	1
the	1
room.	1
"Come	1
along,	1
Cray,"	1
he	1
cried.	1
"Your	1
lunch	1
is	1
just	1
coming	1
in.	1
And	1
the	1
bells	1
are	1
ringing	1
for	1
those	1
who	1
want	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
church."	1
Cray	1
slipped	1
upstairs	1
to	1
change;	1
Dr	1
Oman	1
and	1
Miss	1
Watson	1
betook	1
themselves	1
solemnly	1
down	1
the	1
street,	1
with	1
a	1
string	1
of	1
other	1
churchgoers;	1
but	1
Father	1
Brown	1
noticed	1
that	1
the	1
doctor	1
twice	1
looked	1
back	1
and	1
scrutinized	1
the	1
house;	1
and	1
even	1
came	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
street	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
it	1
again.	1
The	1
priest	1
looked	1
puzzled.	1
"He	1
can't	1
have	1
been	1
at	1
the	1
dustbin,"	1
he	1
muttered.	1
"Not	1
in	1
those	1
clothes.	1
Or	1
was	1
he	1
there	1
earlier	1
today?"	1
Father	1
Brown,	1
touching	1
other	1
people,	1
was	1
as	1
sensitive	1
as	1
a	1
barometer;	1
but	1
today	1
he	1
seemed	1
about	1
as	1
sensitive	1
as	1
a	1
rhinoceros.	1
By	1
no	1
social	1
law,	1
rigid	1
or	1
implied,	1
could	1
he	1
be	1
supposed	1
to	1
linger	1
round	1
the	1
lunch	1
of	1
the	1
Anglo-Indian	1
friends;	1
but	1
he	1
lingered,	1
covering	1
his	1
position	1
with	1
torrents	1
of	1
amusing	1
but	1
quite	1
needless	1
conversation.	1
He	1
was	1
the	1
more	1
puzzling	1
because	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
want	1
any	1
lunch.	1
As	1
one	1
after	1
another	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
exquisitely	1
balanced	1
kedgerees	1
of	1
curries,	1
accompanied	1
with	1
their	1
appropriate	1
vintages,	1
were	1
laid	1
before	1
the	1
other	1
two,	1
he	1
only	1
repeated	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
fast-days,	1
and	1
munched	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
bread	1
and	1
sipped	1
and	1
then	1
left	1
untasted	1
a	1
tumbler	1
of	1
cold	1
water.	1
His	1
talk,	1
however,	1
was	1
exuberant.	1
"I'll	1
tell	1
you	1
what	1
I'll	1
do	1
for	1
you,"	1
he	1
cried--,	1
"I'll	1
mix	1
you	1
a	1
salad!	1
I	1
can't	1
eat	1
it,	1
but	1
I'll	1
mix	1
it	1
like	1
an	1
angel!	1
You've	1
got	1
a	1
lettuce	1
there."	1
"Unfortunately	1
it's	1
the	1
only	1
thing	1
we	1
have	1
got,"	1
answered	1
the	1
good-humoured	1
Major.	1
"You	1
must	1
remember	1
that	1
mustard,	1
vinegar,	1
oil	1
and	1
so	1
on	1
vanished	1
with	1
the	1
cruet	1
and	1
the	1
burglar."	1
"I	1
know,"	1
replied	1
Brown,	1
rather	1
vaguely.	1
"That's	1
what	1
I've	1
always	1
been	1
afraid	1
would	1
happen.	1
That's	1
why	1
I	1
always	1
carry	1
a	1
cruet-stand	1
about	1
with	1
me.	1
I'm	1
so	1
fond	1
of	1
salads."	1
And	1
to	1
the	1
amazement	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
men	1
he	1
took	1
a	1
pepper-pot	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
waistcoat	1
pocket	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
table.	1
"I	1
wonder	1
why	1
the	1
burglar	1
wanted	1
mustard,	1
too,"	1
he	1
went	1
on,	1
taking	1
a	1
mustard-pot	1
from	1
another	1
pocket.	1
"A	1
mustard	1
plaster,	1
I	1
suppose.	1
And	1
vinegar"--and	1
producing	1
that	1
condiment--	1
"haven't	1
I	1
heard	1
something	1
about	1
vinegar	1
and	1
brown	1
paper?	1
As	1
for	1
oil,	1
which	1
I	1
think	1
I	1
put	1
in	1
my	1
left--"	1
His	1
garrulity	1
was	1
an	1
instant	1
arrested;	1
for	1
lifting	1
his	1
eyes,	1
he	1
saw	1
what	1
no	1
one	1
else	1
saw--the	1
black	1
figure	1
of	1
Dr	1
Oman	1
standing	1
on	1
the	1
sunlit	1
lawn	1
and	1
looking	1
steadily	1
into	1
the	1
room.	1
Before	1
he	1
could	1
quite	1
recover	1
himself	1
Cray	1
had	1
cloven	1
in.	1
"You're	1
an	1
astounding	1
card,"	1
he	1
said,	1
staring.	1
"I	1
shall	1
come	1
and	1
hear	1
your	1
sermons,	1
if	1
they're	1
as	1
amusing	1
as	1
your	1
manners."	1
His	1
voice	1
changed	1
a	1
little,	1
and	1
he	1
leaned	1
back	1
in	1
his	1
chair.	1
"Oh,	1
there	1
are	1
sermons	1
in	1
a	1
cruet-stand,	1
too,"	1
said	1
Father	1
Brown,	1
quite	1
gravely.	1
"Have	1
you	1
heard	1
of	1
faith	1
like	1
a	1
grain	1
of	1
mustard-seed;	1
or	1
charity	1
that	1
anoints	1
with	1
oil?	1
And	1
as	1
for	1
vinegar,	1
can	1
any	1
soldiers	1
forget	1
that	1
solitary	1
soldier,	1
who,	1
when	1
the	1
sun	1
was	1
darkened--"	1
Colonel	1
Cray	1
leaned	1
forward	1
a	1
little	1
and	1
clutched	1
the	1
tablecloth.	1
Father	1
Brown,	1
who	1
was	1
making	1
the	1
salad,	1
tipped	1
two	1
spoonfuls	1
of	1
the	1
mustard	1
into	1
the	1
tumbler	1
of	1
water	1
beside	1
him;	1
stood	1
up	1
and	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
new,	1
loud	1
and	1
sudden	1
voice--"Drink	1
that!"	1
At	1
the	1
same	1
moment	1
the	1
motionless	1
doctor	1
in	1
the	1
garden	1
came	1
running,	1
and	1
bursting	1
open	1
a	1
window	1
cried:	1
"Am	1
I	1
wanted?	1
Has	1
he	1
been	1
poisoned?"	1
"Pretty	1
near,"	1
said	1
Brown,	1
with	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
a	1
smile;	1
for	1
the	1
emetic	1
had	1
very	1
suddenly	1
taken	1
effect.	1
And	1
Cray	1
lay	1
in	1
a	1
deck-chair,	1
gasping	1
as	1
for	1
life,	1
but	1
alive.	1
Major	1
Putnam	1
had	1
sprung	1
up,	1
his	1
purple	1
face	1
mottled.	1
"A	1
crime!"	1
he	1
cried	1
hoarsely.	1
"I	1
will	1
go	1
for	1
the	1
police!"	1
The	1
priest	1
could	1
hear	1
him	1
dragging	1
down	1
his	1
palm-leaf	1
hat	1
from	1
the	1
peg	1
and	1
tumbling	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
front	1
door;	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
garden	1
gate	1
slam.	1
But	1
he	1
only	1
stood	1
looking	1
at	1
Cray;	1
and	1
after	1
a	1
silence	1
said	1
quietly:	1
"I	1
shall	1
not	1
talk	1
to	1
you	1
much;	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
you	1
what	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
know.	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
curse	1
on	1
you.	1
The	1
Temple	1
of	1
the	1
Monkey	1
was	1
either	1
a	1
coincidence	1
or	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
trick;	1
the	1
trick	1
was	1
the	1
trick	1
of	1
a	1
white	1
man.	1
There	1
is	1
only	1
one	1
weapon	1
that	1
will	1
bring	1
blood	1
with	1
that	1
mere	1
feathery	1
touch:	1
a	1
razor	1
held	1
by	1
a	1
white	1
man.	1
There	1
is	1
one	1
way	1
of	1
making	1
a	1
common	1
room	1
full	1
of	1
invisible,	1
overpowering	1
poison:	1
turning	1
on	1
the	1
gas--the	1
crime	1
of	1
a	1
white	1
man.	1
And	1
there	1
is	1
only	1
one	1
kind	1
of	1
club	1
that	1
can	1
be	1
thrown	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
window,	1
turn	1
in	1
mid-air	1
and	1
come	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
window	1
next	1
to	1
it:	1
the	1
Australian	1
boomerang.	1
You'll	1
see	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
Major's	1
study."	1
With	1
that	1
he	1
went	1
outside	1
and	1
spoke	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
to	1
the	1
doctor.	1
The	1
moment	1
after,	1
Audrey	1
Watson	1
came	1
rushing	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
fell	1
on	1
her	1
knees	1
beside	1
Cray's	1
chair.	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
hear	1
what	1
they	1
said	1
to	1
each	1
other;	1
but	1
their	1
faces	1
moved	1
with	1
amazement,	1
not	1
unhappiness.	1
The	1
doctor	1
and	1
the	1
priest	1
walked	1
slowly	1
towards	1
the	1
garden	1
gate.	1
"I	1
suppose	1
the	1
Major	1
was	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
her,	1
too,"	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
sigh;	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
other	1
nodded,	1
observed:	1
"You	1
were	1
very	1
generous,	1
doctor.	1
You	1
did	1
a	1
fine	1
thing.	1
But	1
what	1
made	1
you	1
suspect?"	1
"A	1
very	1
small	1
thing,"	1
said	1
Oman;	1
"but	1
it	1
kept	1
me	1
restless	1
in	1
church	1
till	1
I	1
came	1
back	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
all	1
was	1
well.	1
That	1
book	1
on	1
his	1
table	1
was	1
a	1
work	1
on	1
poisons;	1
and	1
was	1
put	1
down	1
open	1
at	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
it	1
stated	1
that	1
a	1
certain	1
Indian	1
poison,	1
though	1
deadly	1
and	1
difficult	1
to	1
trace,	1
was	1
particularly	1
easily	1
reversible	1
by	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
the	1
commonest	1
emetics.	1
I	1
suppose	1
he	1
read	1
that	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
moment--"	1
"And	1
remembered	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
emetics	1
in	1
the	1
cruet-stand,"	1
said	1
Father	1
Brown.	1
"Exactly.	1
He	1
threw	1
the	1
cruet	1
in	1
the	1
dustbin--	1
where	1
I	1
found	1
it,	1
along	1
with	1
other	1
silver--for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
a	1
burglary	1
blind.	1
But	1
if	1
you	1
look	1
at	1
that	1
pepper-pot	1
I	1
put	1
on	1
the	1
table,	1
you'll	1
see	1
a	1
small	1
hole.	1
That's	1
where	1
Cray's	1
bullet	1
struck,	1
shaking	1
up	1
the	1
pepper	1
and	1
making	1
the	1
criminal	1
sneeze."	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
silence.	1
Then	1
Dr	1
Oman	1
said	1
grimly:	1
"The	1
Major	1
is	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
looking	1
for	1
the	1
police."	1
"Or	1
the	1
police	1
in	1
looking	1
for	1
the	1
Major?"	1
said	1
the	1
priest.	1
"Well,	1
good-bye."	1
XI.	1
The	1
Strange	1
Crime	1
of	1
John	1
Boulnois	1
MR	1
CALHOUN	1
KIDD	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
young	1
gentleman	1
with	1
a	1
very	1
old	1
face,	1
a	1
face	1
dried	1
up	1
with	1
its	1
own	1
eagerness,	1
framed	1
in	1
blue-black	1
hair	1
and	1
a	1
black	1
butterfly	1
tie.	1
He	1
was	1
the	1
emissary	1
in	1
England	1
of	1
the	1
colossal	1
American	1
daily	1
called	1
the	1
Western	1
Sun--	1
also	1
humorously	1
described	1
as	1
the	1
"Rising	1
Sunset".	1
This	1
was	1
in	1
allusion	1
to	1
a	1
great	1
journalistic	1
declaration	1
(attributed	1
to	1
Mr	1
Kidd	1
himself)	1
that	1
"he	1
guessed	1
the	1
sun	1
would	1
rise	1
in	1
the	1
west	1
yet,	1
if	1
American	1
citizens	1
did	1
a	1
bit	1
more	1
hustling."	1
Those,	1
however,	1
who	1
mock	1
American	1
journalism	1
from	1
the	1
standpoint	1
of	1
somewhat	1
mellower	1
traditions	1
forget	1
a	1
certain	1
paradox	1
which	1
partly	1
redeems	1
it.	1
For	1
while	1
the	1
journalism	1
of	1
the	1
States	1
permits	1
a	1
pantomimic	1
vulgarity	1
long	1
past	1
anything	1
English,	1
it	1
also	1
shows	1
a	1
real	1
excitement	1
about	1
the	1
most	1
earnest	1
mental	1
problems,	1
of	1
which	1
English	1
papers	1
are	1
innocent,	1
or	1
rather	1
incapable.	1
The	1
Sun	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
solemn	1
matters	1
treated	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
farcical	1
way.	1
William	1
James	1
figured	1
there	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
"Weary	1
Willie,"	1
and	1
pragmatists	1
alternated	1
with	1
pugilists	1
in	1
the	1
long	1
procession	1
of	1
its	1
portraits.	1
Thus,	1
when	1
a	1
very	1
unobtrusive	1
Oxford	1
man	1
named	1
John	1
Boulnois	1
wrote	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
unreadable	1
review	1
called	1
the	1
Natural	1
Philosophy	1
Quarterly	1
a	1
series	1
of	1
articles	1
on	1
alleged	1
weak	1
points	1
in	1
Darwinian	1
evolution,	1
it	1
fluttered	1
no	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
English	1
papers;	1
though	1
Boulnois's	1
theory	1
(which	1
was	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
comparatively	1
stationary	1
universe	1
visited	1
occasionally	1
by	1
convulsions	1
of	1
change)	1
had	1
some	1
rather	1
faddy	1
fashionableness	1
at	1
Oxford,	1
and	1
got	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
named	1
"Catastrophism".	1
But	1
many	1
American	1
papers	1
seized	1
on	1
the	1
challenge	1
as	1
a	1
great	1
event;	1
and	1
the	1
Sun	1
threw	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
Mr	1
Boulnois	1
quite	1
gigantically	1
across	1
its	1
pages.	1
By	1
the	1
paradox	1
already	1
noted,	1
articles	1
of	1
valuable	1
intelligence	1
and	1
enthusiasm	1
were	1
presented	1
with	1
headlines	1
apparently	1
written	1
by	1
an	1
illiterate	1
maniac,	1
headlines	1
such	1
as	1
"Darwin	1
Chews	1
Dirt;	1
Critic	1
Boulnois	1
says	1
He	1
Jumps	1
the	1
Shocks"--or	1
"Keep	1
Catastrophic,	1
says	1
Thinker	1
Boulnois."	1
And	1
Mr	1
Calhoun	1
Kidd,	1
of	1
the	1
Western	1
Sun,	1
was	1
bidden	1
to	1
take	1
his	1
butterfly	1
tie	1
and	1
lugubrious	1
visage	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
little	1
house	1
outside	1
Oxford	1
where	1
Thinker	1
Boulnois	1
lived	1
in	1
happy	1
ignorance	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
title.	1
That	1
fated	1
philosopher	1
had	1
consented,	1
in	1
a	1
somewhat	1
dazed	1
manner,	1
to	1
receive	1
the	1
interviewer,	1
and	1
had	1
named	1
the	1
hour	1
of	1
nine	1
that	1
evening.	1
The	1
last	1
of	1
a	1
summer	1
sunset	1
clung	1
about	1
Cumnor	1
and	1
the	1
low	1
wooded	1
hills;	1
the	1
romantic	1
Yankee	1
was	1
both	1
doubtful	1
of	1
his	1
road	1
and	1
inquisitive	1
about	1
his	1
surroundings;	1
and	1
seeing	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
a	1
genuine	1
feudal	1
old-country	1
inn,	1
The	1
Champion	1
Arms,	1
standing	1
open,	1
he	1
went	1
in	1
to	1
make	1
inquiries.	1
In	1
the	1
bar	1
parlour	1
he	1
rang	1
the	1
bell,	1
and	1
had	1
to	1
wait	1
some	1
little	1
time	1
for	1
a	1
reply	1
to	1
it.	1
The	1
only	1
other	1
person	1
present	1
was	1
a	1
lean	1
man	1
with	1
close	1
red	1
hair	1
and	1
loose,	1
horsey-looking	1
clothes,	1
who	1
was	1
drinking	1
very	1
bad	1
whisky,	1
but	1
smoking	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
cigar.	1
The	1
whisky,	1
of	1
course,	1
was	1
the	1
choice	1
brand	1
of	1
The	1
Champion	1
Arms;	1
the	1
cigar	1
he	1
had	1
probably	1
brought	1
with	1
him	1
from	1
London.	1
Nothing	1
could	1
be	1
more	1
different	1
than	1
his	1
cynical	1
negligence	1
from	1
the	1
dapper	1
dryness	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
American;	1
but	1
something	1
in	1
his	1
pencil	1
and	1
open	1
notebook,	1
and	1
perhaps	1
in	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
his	1
alert	1
blue	1
eye,	1
caused	1
Kidd	1
to	1
guess,	1
correctly,	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
brother	1
journalist.	1
"Could	1
you	1
do	1
me	1
the	1
favour,"	1
asked	1
Kidd,	1
with	1
the	1
courtesy	1
of	1
his	1
nation,	1
"of	1
directing	1
me	1
to	1
the	1
Grey	1
Cottage,	1
where	1
Mr	1
Boulnois	1
lives,	1
as	1
I	1
understand?"	1
"It's	1
a	1
few	1
yards	1
down	1
the	1
road,"	1
said	1
the	1
red-haired	1
man,	1
removing	1
his	1
cigar;	1
"I	1
shall	1
be	1
passing	1
it	1
myself	1
in	1
a	1
minute,	1
but	1
I'm	1
going	1
on	1
to	1
Pendragon	1
Park	1
to	1
try	1
and	1
see	1
the	1
fun."	1
"What	1
is	1
Pendragon	1
Park?"	1
asked	1
Calhoun	1
Kidd.	1
"Sir	1
Claude	1
Champion's	1
place--haven't	1
you	1
come	1
down	1
for	1
that,	1
too?"	1
asked	1
the	1
other	1
pressman,	1
looking	1
up.	1
"You're	1
a	1
journalist,	1
aren't	1
you?"	1
"I	1
have	1
come	1
to	1
see	1
Mr	1
Boulnois,"	1
said	1
Kidd.	1
"I've	1
come	1
to	1
see	1
Mrs	1
Boulnois,"	1
replied	1
the	1
other.	1
"But	1
I	1
shan't	1
catch	1
her	1
at	1
home."	1
And	1
he	1
laughed	1
rather	1
unpleasantly.	1
"Are	1
you	1
interested	1
in	1
Catastrophism?"	1
asked	1
the	1
wondering	1
Yankee.	1
"I'm	1
interested	1
in	1
catastrophes;	1
and	1
there	1
are	1
going	1
to	1
be	1
some,"	1
replied	1
his	1
companion	1
gloomily.	1
"Mine's	1
a	1
filthy	1
trade,	1
and	1
I	1
never	1
pretend	1
it	1
isn't."	1
With	1
that	1
he	1
spat	1
on	1
the	1
floor;	1
yet	1
somehow	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
act	1
and	1
instant	1
one	1
could	1
realize	1
that	1
the	1
man	1
had	1
been	1
brought	1
up	1
as	1
a	1
gentleman.	1
The	1
American	1
pressman	1
considered	1
him	1
with	1
more	1
attention.	1
His	1
face	1
was	1
pale	1
and	1
dissipated,	1
with	1
the	1
promise	1
of	1
formidable	1
passions	1
yet	1
to	1
be	1
loosed;	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
clever	1
and	1
sensitive	1
face;	1
his	1
clothes	1
were	1
coarse	1
and	1
careless,	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
good	1
seal	1
ring	1
on	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
long,	1
thin	1
fingers.	1
His	1
name,	1
which	1
came	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
talk,	1
was	1
James	1
Dalroy;	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
a	1
bankrupt	1
Irish	1
landlord,	1
and	1
attached	1
to	1
a	1
pink	1
paper	1
which	1
he	1
heartily	1
despised,	1
called	1
Smart	1
Society,	1
in	1
the	1
capacity	1
of	1
reporter	1
and	1
of	1
something	1
painfully	1
like	1
a	1
spy.	1
Smart	1
Society,	1
I	1
regret	1
to	1
say,	1
felt	1
none	1
of	1
that	1
interest	1
in	1
Boulnois	1
on	1
Darwin	1
which	1
was	1
such	1
a	1
credit	1
to	1
the	1
head	1
and	1
hearts	1
of	1
the	1
Western	1
Sun.	1
Dalroy	1
had	1
come	1
down,	1
it	1
seemed,	1
to	1
snuff	1
up	1
the	1
scent	1
of	1
a	1
scandal	1
which	1
might	1
very	1
well	1
end	1
in	1
the	1
Divorce	1
Court,	1
but	1
which	1
was	1
at	1
present	1
hovering	1
between	1
Grey	1
Cottage	1
and	1
Pendragon	1
Park.	1
Sir	1
Claude	1
Champion	1
was	1
known	1
to	1
the	1
readers	1
of	1
the	1
Western	1
Sun	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
Mr	1
Boulnois.	1
So	1
were	1
the	1
Pope	1
and	1
the	1
Derby	1
Winner;	1
but	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
their	1
intimate	1
acquaintanceship	1
would	1
have	1
struck	1
Kidd	1
as	1
equally	1
incongruous.	1
He	1
had	1
heard	1
of	1
(and	1
written	1
about,	1
nay,	1
falsely	1
pretended	1
to	1
know)	1
Sir	1
Claude	1
Champion,	1
as	1
"one	1
of	1
the	1
brightest	1
and	1
wealthiest	1
of	1
England's	1
Upper	1
Ten";	1
as	1
the	1
great	1
sportsman	1
who	1
raced	1
yachts	1
round	1
the	1
world;	1
as	1
the	1
great	1
traveller	1
who	1
wrote	1
books	1
about	1
the	1
Himalayas,	1
as	1
the	1
politician	1
who	1
swept	1
constituencies	1
with	1
a	1
startling	1
sort	1
of	1
Tory	1
Democracy,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
great	1
dabbler	1
in	1
art,	1
music,	1
literature,	1
and,	1
above	1
all,	1
acting.	1
Sir	1
Claude	1
was	1
really	1
rather	1
magnificent	1
in	1
other	1
than	1
American	1
eyes.	1
There	1
was	1
something	1
of	1
the	1
Renascence	1
Prince	1
about	1
his	1
omnivorous	1
culture	1
and	1
restless	1
publicity--,	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
only	1
a	1
great	1
amateur,	1
but	1
an	1
ardent	1
one.	1
There	1
was	1
in	1
him	1
none	1
of	1
that	1
antiquarian	1
frivolity	1
that	1
we	1
convey	1
by	1
the	1
word	1
"dilettante".	1
That	1
faultless	1
falcon	1
profile	1
with	1
purple-black	1
Italian	1
eye,	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
snap-shotted	1
so	1
often	1
both	1
for	1
Smart	1
Society	1
and	1
the	1
Western	1
Sun,	1
gave	1
everyone	1
the	1
impression	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
eaten	1
by	1
ambition	1
as	1
by	1
a	1
fire,	1
or	1
even	1
a	1
disease.	1
But	1
though	1
Kidd	1
knew	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
about	1
Sir	1
Claude--a	1
great	1
deal	1
more,	1
in	1
fact,	1
than	1
there	1
was	1
to	1
know--	1
it	1
would	1
never	1
have	1
crossed	1
his	1
wildest	1
dreams	1
to	1
connect	1
so	1
showy	1
an	1
aristocrat	1
with	1
the	1
newly-unearthed	1
founder	1
of	1
Catastrophism,	1
or	1
to	1
guess	1
that	1
Sir	1
Claude	1
Champion	1
and	1
John	1
Boulnois	1
could	1
be	1
intimate	1
friends.	1
Such,	1
according	1
to	1
Dalroy's	1
account,	1
was	1
nevertheless	1
the	1
fact.	1
The	1
two	1
had	1
hunted	1
in	1
couples	1
at	1
school	1
and	1
college,	1
and,	1
though	1
their	1
social	1
destinies	1
had	1
been	1
very	1
different	1
(for	1
Champion	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
landlord	1
and	1
almost	1
a	1
millionaire,	1
while	1
Boulnois	1
was	1
a	1
poor	1
scholar	1
and,	1
until	1
just	1
lately,	1
an	1
unknown	1
one),	1
they	1
still	1
kept	1
in	1
very	1
close	1
touch	1
with	1
each	1
other.	1
Indeed,	1
Boulnois's	1
cottage	1
stood	1
just	1
outside	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
Pendragon	1
Park.	1
But	1
whether	1
the	1
two	1
men	1
could	1
be	1
friends	1
much	1
longer	1
was	1
becoming	1
a	1
dark	1
and	1
ugly	1
question.	1
A	1
year	1
or	1
two	1
before,	1
Boulnois	1
had	1
married	1
a	1
beautiful	1
and	1
not	1
unsuccessful	1
actress,	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
was	1
devoted	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
shy	1
and	1
ponderous	1
style;	1
and	1
the	1
proximity	1
of	1
the	1
household	1
to	1
Champion's	1
had	1
given	1
that	1
flighty	1
celebrity	1
opportunities	1
for	1
behaving	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
that	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
cause	1
painful	1
and	1
rather	1
base	1
excitement.	1
Sir	1
Claude	1
had	1
carried	1
the	1
arts	1
of	1
publicity	1
to	1
perfection;	1
and	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
crazy	1
pleasure	1
in	1
being	1
equally	1
ostentatious	1
in	1
an	1
intrigue	1
that	1
could	1
do	1
him	1
no	1
sort	1
of	1
honour.	1
Footmen	1
from	1
Pendragon	1
were	1
perpetually	1
leaving	1
bouquets	1
for	1
Mrs	1
Boulnois;	1
carriages	1
and	1
motor-cars	1
were	1
perpetually	1
calling	1
at	1
the	1
cottage	1
for	1
Mrs	1
Boulnois;	1
balls	1
and	1
masquerades	1
perpetually	1
filled	1
the	1
grounds	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
baronet	1
paraded	1
Mrs	1
Boulnois,	1
like	1
the	1
Queen	1
of	1
Love	1
and	1
Beauty	1
at	1
a	1
tournament.	1
That	1
very	1
evening,	1
marked	1
by	1
Mr	1
Kidd	1
for	1
the	1
exposition	1
of	1
Catastrophism,	1
had	1
been	1
marked	1
by	1
Sir	1
Claude	1
Champion	1
for	1
an	1
open-air	1
rendering	1
of	1
Romeo	1
and	1
Juliet,	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
play	1
Romeo	1
to	1
a	1
Juliet	1
it	1
was	1
needless	1
to	1
name.	1
"I	1
don't	1
think	1
it	1
can	1
go	1
on	1
without	1
a	1
smash,"	1
said	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
with	1
red	1
hair,	1
getting	1
up	1
and	1
shaking	1
himself.	1
"Old	1
Boulnois	1
may	1
be	1
squared--or	1
he	1
may	1
be	1
square.	1
But	1
if	1
he's	1
square	1
he's	1
thick--	1
what	1
you	1
might	1
call	1
cubic.	1
But	1
I	1
don't	1
believe	1
it's	1
possible."	1
"He	1
is	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
grand	1
intellectual	1
powers,"	1
said	1
Calhoun	1
Kidd	1
in	1
a	1
deep	1
voice.	1
"Yes,"	1
answered	1
Dalroy;	1
"but	1
even	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
grand	1
intellectual	1
powers	1
can't	1
be	1
such	1
a	1
blighted	1
fool	1
as	1
all	1
that.	1
Must	1
you	1
be	1
going	1
on?	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
following	1
myself	1
in	1
a	1
minute	1
or	1
two."	1
But	1
Calhoun	1
Kidd,	1
having	1
finished	1
a	1
milk	1
and	1
soda,	1
betook	1
himself	1
smartly	1
up	1
the	1
road	1
towards	1
the	1
Grey	1
Cottage,	1
leaving	1
his	1
cynical	1
informant	1
to	1
his	1
whisky	1
and	1
tobacco.	1
The	1
last	1
of	1
the	1
daylight	1
had	1
faded;	1
the	1
skies	1
were	1
of	1
a	1
dark,	1
green-grey,	1
like	1
slate,	1
studded	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
with	1
a	1
star,	1
but	1
lighter	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
sky,	1
with	1
the	1
promise	1
of	1
a	1
rising	1
moon.	1
The	1
Grey	1
Cottage,	1
which	1
stood	1
entrenched,	1
as	1
it	1
were,	1
in	1
a	1
square	1
of	1
stiff,	1
high	1
thorn-hedges,	1
was	1
so	1
close	1
under	1
the	1
pines	1
and	1
palisades	1
of	1
the	1
Park	1
that	1
Kidd	1
at	1
first	1
mistook	1
it	1
for	1
the	1
Park	1
Lodge.	1
Finding	1
the	1
name	1
on	1
the	1
narrow	1
wooden	1
gate,	1
however,	1
and	1
seeing	1
by	1
his	1
watch	1
that	1
the	1
hour	1
of	1
the	1
"Thinker's"	1
appointment	1
had	1
just	1
struck,	1
he	1
went	1
in	1
and	1
knocked	1
at	1
the	1
front	1
door.	1
Inside	1
the	1
garden	1
hedge,	1
he	1
could	1
see	1
that	1
the	1
house,	1
though	1
unpretentious	1
enough,	1
was	1
larger	1
and	1
more	1
luxurious	1
than	1
it	1
looked	1
at	1
first,	1
and	1
was	1
quite	1
a	1
different	1
kind	1
of	1
place	1
from	1
a	1
porter's	1
lodge.	1
A	1
dog-kennel	1
and	1
a	1
beehive	1
stood	1
outside,	1
like	1
symbols	1
of	1
old	1
English	1
country-life;	1
the	1
moon	1
was	1
rising	1
behind	1
a	1
plantation	1
of	1
prosperous	1
pear	1
trees,	1
the	1
dog	1
that	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
kennel	1
was	1
reverend-looking	1
and	1
reluctant	1
to	1
bark;	1
and	1
the	1
plain,	1
elderly	1
man-servant	1
who	1
opened	1
the	1
door	1
was	1
brief	1
but	1
dignified.	1
"Mr	1
Boulnois	1
asked	1
me	1
to	1
offer	1
his	1
apologies,	1
sir,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"but	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
obliged	1
to	1
go	1
out	1
suddenly."	1
"But	1
see	1
here,	1
I	1
had	1
an	1
appointment,"	1
said	1
the	1
interviewer,	1
with	1
a	1
rising	1
voice.	1
"Do	1
you	1
know	1
where	1
he	1
went	1
to?"	1
"To	1
Pendragon	1
Park,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
the	1
servant,	1
rather	1
sombrely,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
close	1
the	1
door.	1
Kidd	1
started	1
a	1
little.	1
"Did	1
he	1
go	1
with	1
Mrs--with	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
party?"	1
he	1
asked	1
rather	1
vaguely.	1
"No,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
the	1
man	1
shortly;	1
"he	1
stayed	1
behind,	1
and	1
then	1
went	1
out	1
alone."	1
And	1
he	1
shut	1
the	1
door,	1
brutally,	1
but	1
with	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
duty	1
not	1
done.	1
The	1
American,	1
that	1
curious	1
compound	1
of	1
impudence	1
and	1
sensitiveness,	1
was	1
annoyed.	1
He	1
felt	1
a	1
strong	1
desire	1
to	1
hustle	1
them	1
all	1
along	1
a	1
bit	1
and	1
teach	1
them	1
business	1
habits;	1
the	1
hoary	1
old	1
dog	1
and	1
the	1
grizzled,	1
heavy-faced	1
old	1
butler	1
with	1
his	1
prehistoric	1
shirt-front,	1
and	1
the	1
drowsy	1
old	1
moon,	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
the	1
scatter-brained	1
old	1
philosopher	1
who	1
couldn't	1
keep	1
an	1
appointment.	1
"If	1
that's	1
the	1
way	1
he	1
goes	1
on	1
he	1
deserves	1
to	1
lose	1
his	1
wife's	1
purest	1
devotion,"	1
said	1
Mr	1
Calhoun	1
Kidd.	1
"But	1
perhaps	1
he's	1
gone	1
over	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
row.	1
In	1
that	1
case	1
I	1
reckon	1
a	1
man	1
from	1
the	1
Western	1
Sun	1
will	1
be	1
on	1
the	1
spot."	1
And	1
turning	1
the	1
corner	1
by	1
the	1
open	1
lodge-gates,	1
he	1
set	1
off,	1
stumping	1
up	1
the	1
long	1
avenue	1
of	1
black	1
pine-woods	1
that	1
pointed	1
in	1
abrupt	1
perspective	1
towards	1
the	1
inner	1
gardens	1
of	1
Pendragon	1
Park.	1
The	1
trees	1
were	1
as	1
black	1
and	1
orderly	1
as	1
plumes	1
upon	1
a	1
hearse;	1
there	1
were	1
still	1
a	1
few	1
stars.	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
with	1
more	1
literary	1
than	1
direct	1
natural	1
associations;	1
the	1
word	1
"Ravenswood"	1
came	1
into	1
his	1
head	1
repeatedly.	1
It	1
was	1
partly	1
the	1
raven	1
colour	1
of	1
the	1
pine-woods;	1
but	1
partly	1
also	1
an	1
indescribable	1
atmosphere	1
almost	1
described	1
in	1
Scott's	1
great	1
tragedy;	1
the	1
smell	1
of	1
something	1
that	1
died	1
in	1
the	1
eighteenth	1
century;	1
the	1
smell	1
of	1
dank	1
gardens	1
and	1
broken	1
urns,	1
of	1
wrongs	1
that	1
will	1
never	1
now	1
be	1
righted;	1
of	1
something	1
that	1
is	1
none	1
the	1
less	1
incurably	1
sad	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
strangely	1
unreal.	1
More	1
than	1
once,	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
that	1
strange,	1
black	1
road	1
of	1
tragic	1
artifice,	1
he	1
stopped,	1
startled,	1
thinking	1
he	1
heard	1
steps	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
him.	1
He	1
could	1
see	1
nothing	1
in	1
front	1
but	1
the	1
twin	1
sombre	1
walls	1
of	1
pine	1
and	1
the	1
wedge	1
of	1
starlit	1
sky	1
above	1
them.	1
At	1
first	1
he	1
thought	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
fancied	1
it	1
or	1
been	1
mocked	1
by	1
a	1
mere	1
echo	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
tramp.	1
But	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
he	1
was	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
inclined	1
to	1
conclude,	1
with	1
the	1
remains	1
of	1
his	1
reason,	1
that	1
there	1
really	1
were	1
other	1
feet	1
upon	1
the	1
road.	1
He	1
thought	1
hazily	1
of	1
ghosts;	1
and	1
was	1
surprised	1
how	1
swiftly	1
he	1
could	1
see	1
the	1
image	1
of	1
an	1
appropriate	1
and	1
local	1
ghost,	1
one	1
with	1
a	1
face	1
as	1
white	1
as	1
Pierrot's,	1
but	1
patched	1
with	1
black.	1
The	1
apex	1
of	1
the	1
triangle	1
of	1
dark-blue	1
sky	1
was	1
growing	1
brighter	1
and	1
bluer,	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
realize	1
as	1
yet	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
coming	1
nearer	1
to	1
the	1
lights	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
house	1
and	1
garden.	1
He	1
only	1
felt	1
that	1
the	1
atmosphere	1
was	1
growing	1
more	1
intense,	1
there	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
sadness	1
more	1
violence	1
and	1
secrecy--more--he	1
hesitated	1
for	1
the	1
word,	1
and	1
then	1
said	1
it	1
with	1
a	1
jerk	1
of	1
laughter--Catastrophism.	1
More	1
pines,	1
more	1
pathway	1
slid	1
past	1
him,	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
stood	1
rooted	1
as	1
by	1
a	1
blast	1
of	1
magic.	1
It	1
is	1
vain	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
he	1
felt	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
got	1
into	1
a	1
dream;	1
but	1
this	1
time	1
he	1
felt	1
quite	1
certain	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
got	1
into	1
a	1
book.	1
For	1
we	1
human	1
beings	1
are	1
used	1
to	1
inappropriate	1
things;	1
we	1
are	1
accustomed	1
to	1
the	1
clatter	1
of	1
the	1
incongruous;	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
tune	1
to	1
which	1
we	1
can	1
go	1
to	1
sleep.	1
If	1
one	1
appropriate	1
thing	1
happens,	1
it	1
wakes	1
us	1
up	1
like	1
the	1
pang	1
of	1
a	1
perfect	1
chord.	1
Something	1
happened	1
such	1
as	1
would	1
have	1
happened	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
place	1
in	1
a	1
forgotten	1
tale.	1
Over	1
the	1
black	1
pine-wood	1
came	1
flying	1
and	1
flashing	1
in	1
the	1
moon	1
a	1
naked	1
sword--such	1
a	1
slender	1
and	1
sparkling	1
rapier	1
as	1
may	1
have	1
fought	1
many	1
an	1
unjust	1
duel	1
in	1
that	1
ancient	1
park.	1
It	1
fell	1
on	1
the	1
pathway	1
far	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
lay	1
there	1
glistening	1
like	1
a	1
large	1
needle.	1
He	1
ran	1
like	1
a	1
hare	1
and	1
bent	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
it.	1
Seen	1
at	1
close	1
quarters	1
it	1
had	1
rather	1
a	1
showy	1
look:	1
the	1
big	1
red	1
jewels	1
in	1
the	1
hilt	1
and	1
guard	1
were	1
a	1
little	1
dubious.	1
But	1
there	1
were	1
other	1
red	1
drops	1
upon	1
the	1
blade	1
which	1
were	1
not	1
dubious.	1
He	1
looked	1
round	1
wildly	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
from	1
which	1
the	1
dazzling	1
missile	1
had	1
come,	1
and	1
saw	1
that	1
at	1
this	1
point	1
the	1
sable	1
facade	1
of	1
fir	1
and	1
pine	1
was	1
interrupted	1
by	1
a	1
smaller	1
road	1
at	1
right	1
angles;	1
which,	1
when	1
he	1
turned	1
it,	1
brought	1
him	1
in	1
full	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
long,	1
lighted	1
house,	1
with	1
a	1
lake	1
and	1
fountains	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
it.	1
Nevertheless,	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
look	1
at	1
this,	1
having	1
something	1
more	1
interesting	1
to	1
look	1
at.	1
Above	1
him,	1
at	1
the	1
angle	1
of	1
the	1
steep	1
green	1
bank	1
of	1
the	1
terraced	1
garden,	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
small	1
picturesque	1
surprises	1
common	1
in	1
the	1
old	1
landscape	1
gardening;	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
small	1
round	1
hill	1
or	1
dome	1
of	1
grass,	1
like	1
a	1
giant	1
mole-hill,	1
ringed	1
and	1
crowned	1
with	1
three	1
concentric	1
fences	1
of	1
roses,	1
and	1
having	1
a	1
sundial	1
in	1
the	1
highest	1
point	1
in	1
the	1
centre.	1
Kidd	1
could	1
see	1
the	1
finger	1
of	1
the	1
dial	1
stand	1
up	1
dark	1
against	1
the	1
sky	1
like	1
the	1
dorsal	1
fin	1
of	1
a	1
shark	1
and	1
the	1
vain	1
moonlight	1
clinging	1
to	1
that	1
idle	1
clock.	1
But	1
he	1
saw	1
something	1
else	1
clinging	1
to	1
it	1
also,	1
for	1
one	1
wild	1
moment--the	1
figure	1
of	1
a	1
man.	1
Though	1
he	1
saw	1
it	1
there	1
only	1
for	1
a	1
moment,	1
though	1
it	1
was	1
outlandish	1
and	1
incredible	1
in	1
costume,	1
being	1
clad	1
from	1
neck	1
to	1
heel	1
in	1
tight	1
crimson,	1
with	1
glints	1
of	1
gold,	1
yet	1
he	1
knew	1
in	1
one	1
flash	1
of	1
moonlight	1
who	1
it	1
was.	1
That	1
white	1
face	1
flung	1
up	1
to	1
heaven,	1
clean-shaven	1
and	1
so	1
unnaturally	1
young,	1
like	1
Byron	1
with	1
a	1
Roman	1
nose,	1
those	1
black	1
curls	1
already	1
grizzled--	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
the	1
thousand	1
public	1
portraits	1
of	1
Sir	1
Claude	1
Champion.	1
The	1
wild	1
red	1
figure	1
reeled	1
an	1
instant	1
against	1
the	1
sundial;	1
the	1
next	1
it	1
had	1
rolled	1
down	1
the	1
steep	1
bank	1
and	1
lay	1
at	1
the	1
American's	1
feet,	1
faintly	1
moving	1
one	1
arm.	1
A	1
gaudy,	1
unnatural	1
gold	1
ornament	1
on	1
the	1
arm	1
suddenly	1
reminded	1
Kidd	1
of	1
Romeo	1
and	1
Juliet;	1
of	1
course	1
the	1
tight	1
crimson	1
suit	1
was	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
play.	1
But	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
long	1
red	1
stain	1
down	1
the	1
bank	1
from	1
which	1
the	1
man	1
had	1
rolled--that	1
was	1
no	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
play.	1
He	1
had	1
been	1
run	1
through	1
the	1
body.	1
Mr	1
Calhoun	1
Kidd	1
shouted	1
and	1
shouted	1
again.	1
Once	1
more	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
hear	1
phantasmal	1
footsteps,	1
and	1
started	1
to	1
find	1
another	1
figure	1
already	1
near	1
him.	1
He	1
knew	1
the	1
figure,	1
and	1
yet	1
it	1
terrified	1
him.	1
The	1
dissipated	1
youth	1
who	1
had	1
called	1
himself	1
Dalroy	1
had	1
a	1
horribly	1
quiet	1
way	1
with	1
him;	1
if	1
Boulnois	1
failed	1
to	1
keep	1
appointments	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
made,	1
Dalroy	1
had	1
a	1
sinister	1
air	1
of	1
keeping	1
appointments	1
that	1
hadn't.	1
The	1
moonlight	1
discoloured	1
everything,	1
against	1
Dalroy's	1
red	1
hair	1
his	1
wan	1
face	1
looked	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
white	1
as	1
pale	1
green.	1
All	1
this	1
morbid	1
impressionism	1
must	1
be	1
Kidd's	1
excuse	1
for	1
having	1
cried	1
out,	1
brutally	1
and	1
beyond	1
all	1
reason:	1
"Did	1
you	1
do	1
this,	1
you	1
devil?"	1
James	1
Dalroy	1
smiled	1
his	1
unpleasing	1
smile;	1
but	1
before	1
he	1
could	1
speak,	1
the	1
fallen	1
figure	1
made	1
another	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
arm,	1
waving	1
vaguely	1
towards	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
the	1
sword	1
fell;	1
then	1
came	1
a	1
moan,	1
and	1
then	1
it	1
managed	1
to	1
speak.	1
"Boulnois....	1
Boulnois,	1
I	1
say....	1
Boulnois	1
did	1
it...	1
jealous	1
of	1
me...he	1
was	1
jealous,	1
he	1
was,	1
he	1
was..."	1
Kidd	1
bent	1
his	1
head	1
down	1
to	1
hear	1
more,	1
and	1
just	1
managed	1
to	1
catch	1
the	1
words:	1
"Boulnois...with	1
my	1
own	1
sword...he	1
threw	1
it..."	1
Again	1
the	1
failing	1
hand	1
waved	1
towards	1
the	1
sword,	1
and	1
then	1
fell	1
rigid	1
with	1
a	1
thud.	1
In	1
Kidd	1
rose	1
from	1
its	1
depth	1
all	1
that	1
acrid	1
humour	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
strange	1
salt	1
of	1
the	1
seriousness	1
of	1
his	1
race.	1
"See	1
here,"	1
he	1
said	1
sharply	1
and	1
with	1
command,	1
"you	1
must	1
fetch	1
a	1
doctor.	1
This	1
man's	1
dead."	1
"And	1
a	1
priest,	1
too,	1
I	1
suppose,"	1
said	1
Dalroy	1
in	1
an	1
undecipherable	1
manner.	1
"All	1
these	1
Champions	1
are	1
papists."	1
The	1
American	1
knelt	1
down	1
by	1
the	1
body,	1
felt	1
the	1
heart,	1
propped	1
up	1
the	1
head	1
and	1
used	1
some	1
last	1
efforts	1
at	1
restoration;	1
but	1
before	1
the	1
other	1
journalist	1
reappeared,	1
followed	1
by	1
a	1
doctor	1
and	1
a	1
priest,	1
he	1
was	1
already	1
prepared	1
to	1
assert	1
they	1
were	1
too	1
late.	1
"Were	1
you	1
too	1
late	1
also?"	1
asked	1
the	1
doctor,	1
a	1
solid	1
prosperous-looking	1
man,	1
with	1
conventional	1
moustache	1
and	1
whiskers,	1
but	1
a	1
lively	1
eye,	1
which	1
darted	1
over	1
Kidd	1
dubiously.	1
"In	1
one	1
sense,"	1
drawled	1
the	1
representative	1
of	1
the	1
Sun.	1
"I	1
was	1
too	1
late	1
to	1
save	1
the	1
man,	1
but	1
I	1
guess	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
hear	1
something	1
of	1
importance.	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
dead	1
man	1
denounce	1
his	1
assassin."	1
"And	1
who	1
was	1
the	1
assassin?"	1
asked	1
the	1
doctor,	1
drawing	1
his	1
eyebrows	1
together.	1
"Boulnois,"	1
said	1
Calhoun	1
Kidd,	1
and	1
whistled	1
softly.	1
The	1
doctor	1
stared	1
at	1
him	1
gloomily	1
with	1
a	1
reddening	1
brow--,	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
contradict.	1
Then	1
the	1
priest,	1
a	1
shorter	1
figure	1
in	1
the	1
background,	1
said	1
mildly:	1
"I	1
understood	1
that	1
Mr	1
Boulnois	1
was	1
not	1
coming	1
to	1
Pendragon	1
Park	1
this	1
evening."	1
"There	1
again,"	1
said	1
the	1
Yankee	1
grimly,	1
"I	1
may	1
be	1
in	1
a	1
position	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
old	1
country	1
a	1
fact	1
or	1
two.	1
Yes,	1
sir,	1
John	1
Boulnois	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
stay	1
in	1
all	1
this	1
evening;	1
he	1
fixed	1
up	1
a	1
real	1
good	1
appointment	1
there	1
with	1
me.	1
But	1
John	1
Boulnois	1
changed	1
his	1
mind;	1
John	1
Boulnois	1
left	1
his	1
home	1
abruptly	1
and	1
all	1
alone,	1
and	1
came	1
over	1
to	1
this	1
darned	1
Park	1
an	1
hour	1
or	1
so	1
ago.	1
His	1
butler	1
told	1
me	1
so.	1
I	1
think	1
we	1
hold	1
what	1
the	1
all-wise	1
police	1
call	1
a	1
clue--have	1
you	1
sent	1
for	1
them?"	1
"Yes,"	1
said	1
the	1
doctor,	1
"but	1
we	1
haven't	1
alarmed	1
anyone	1
else	1
yet."	1
"Does	1
Mrs	1
Boulnois	1
know?"	1
asked	1
James	1
Dalroy,	1
and	1
again	1
Kidd	1
was	1
conscious	1
of	1
an	1
irrational	1
desire	1
to	1
hit	1
him	1
on	1
his	1
curling	1
mouth.	1
"I	1
have	1
not	1
told	1
her,"	1
said	1
the	1
doctor	1
gruffly--,	1
"but	1
here	1
come	1
the	1
police."	1
The	1
little	1
priest	1
had	1
stepped	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
main	1
avenue,	1
and	1
now	1
returned	1
with	1
the	1
fallen	1
sword,	1
which	1
looked	1
ludicrously	1
large	1
and	1
theatrical	1
when	1
attached	1
to	1
his	1
dumpy	1
figure,	1
at	1
once	1
clerical	1
and	1
commonplace.	1
"Just	1
before	1
the	1
police	1
come,"	1
he	1
said	1
apologetically,	1
"has	1
anyone	1
got	1
a	1
light?"	1
The	1
Yankee	1
journalist	1
took	1
an	1
electric	1
torch	1
from	1
his	1
pocket,	1
and	1
the	1
priest	1
held	1
it	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
middle	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
blade,	1
which	1
he	1
examined	1
with	1
blinking	1
care.	1
Then,	1
without	1
glancing	1
at	1
the	1
point	1
or	1
pommel,	1
he	1
handed	1
the	1
long	1
weapon	1
to	1
the	1
doctor.	1
"I	1
fear	1
I'm	1
no	1
use	1
here,"	1
he	1
said,	1
with	1
a	1
brief	1
sigh.	1
"I'll	1
say	1
good	1
night	1
to	1
you,	1
gentlemen."	1
And	1
he	1
walked	1
away	1
up	1
the	1
dark	1
avenue	1
towards	1
the	1
house,	1
his	1
hands	1
clasped	1
behind	1
him	1
and	1
his	1
big	1
head	1
bent	1
in	1
cogitation.	1
The	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
group	1
made	1
increased	1
haste	1
towards	1
the	1
lodge-gates,	1
where	1
an	1
inspector	1
and	1
two	1
constables	1
could	1
already	1
be	1
seen	1
in	1
consultation	1
with	1
the	1
lodge-keeper.	1
But	1
the	1
little	1
priest	1
only	1
walked	1
slower	1
and	1
slower	1
in	1
the	1
dim	1
cloister	1
of	1
pine,	1
and	1
at	1
last	1
stopped	1
dead,	1
on	1
the	1
steps	1
of	1
the	1
house.	1
It	1
was	1
his	1
silent	1
way	1
of	1
acknowledging	1
an	1
equally	1
silent	1
approach;	1
for	1
there	1
came	1
towards	1
him	1
a	1
presence	1
that	1
might	1
have	1
satisfied	1
even	1
Calhoun	1
Kidd's	1
demands	1
for	1
a	1
lovely	1
and	1
aristocratic	1
ghost.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
young	1
woman	1
in	1
silvery	1
satins	1
of	1
a	1
Renascence	1
design;	1
she	1
had	1
golden	1
hair	1
in	1
two	1
long	1
shining	1
ropes,	1
and	1
a	1
face	1
so	1
startingly	1
pale	1
between	1
them	1
that	1
she	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
chryselephantine--made,	1
that	1
is,	1
like	1
some	1
old	1
Greek	1
statues,	1
out	1
of	1
ivory	1
and	1
gold.	1
But	1
her	1
eyes	1
were	1
very	1
bright,	1
and	1
her	1
voice,	1
though	1
low,	1
was	1
confident.	1
"Father	1
Brown?"	1
she	1
said.	1
"Mrs	1
Boulnois?"	1
he	1
replied	1
gravely.	1
Then	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
and	1
immediately	1
said:	1
"I	1
see	1
you	1
know	1
about	1
Sir	1
Claude."	1
"How	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
I	1
know?"	1
she	1
asked	1
steadily.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
answer	1
the	1
question,	1
but	1
asked	1
another:	1
"Have	1
you	1
seen	1
your	1
husband?"	1
"My	1
husband	1
is	1
at	1
home,"	1
she	1
said.	1
"He	1
has	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
this."	1
Again	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
answer;	1
and	1
the	1
woman	1
drew	1
nearer	1
to	1
him,	1
with	1
a	1
curiously	1
intense	1
expression	1
on	1
her	1
face.	1
"Shall	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
something	1
more?"	1
she	1
said,	1
with	1
a	1
rather	1
fearful	1
smile.	1
"I	1
don't	1
think	1
he	1
did	1
it,	1
and	1
you	1
don't	1
either."	1
Father	1
Brown	1
returned	1
her	1
gaze	1
with	1
a	1
long,	1
grave	1
stare,	1
and	1
then	1
nodded,	1
yet	1
more	1
gravely.	1
"Father	1
Brown,"	1
said	1
the	1
lady,	1
"I	1
am	1
going	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
all	1
I	1
know,	1
but	1
I	1
want	1
you	1
to	1
do	1
me	1
a	1
favour	1
first.	1
Will	1
you	1
tell	1
me	1
why	1
you	1
haven't	1
jumped	1
to	1
the	1
conclusion	1
of	1
poor	1
John's	1
guilt,	1
as	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
have	1
done?	1
Don't	1
mind	1
what	1
you	1
say:	1
I--I	1
know	1
about	1
the	1
gossip	1
and	1
the	1
appearances	1
that	1
are	1
against	1
me."	1
Father	1
Brown	1
looked	1
honestly	1
embarrassed,	1
and	1
passed	1
his	1
hand	1
across	1
his	1
forehead.	1
"Two	1
very	1
little	1
things,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"At	1
least,	1
one's	1
very	1
trivial	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
very	1
vague.	1
But	1
such	1
as	1
they	1
are,	1
they	1
don't	1
fit	1
in	1
with	1
Mr	1
Boulnois	1
being	1
the	1
murderer."	1
He	1
turned	1
his	1
blank,	1
round	1
face	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
stars	1
and	1
continued	1
absentmindedly:	1
"To	1
take	1
the	1
vague	1
idea	1
first.	1
I	1
attach	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
of	1
importance	1
to	1
vague	1
ideas.	1
All	1
those	1
things	1
that	1
`aren't	1
evidence'	1
are	1
what	1
convince	1
me.	1
I	1
think	1
a	1
moral	1
impossibility	1
the	1
biggest	1
of	1
all	1
impossibilities.	1
I	1
know	1
your	1
husband	1
only	1
slightly,	1
but	1
I	1
think	1
this	1
crime	1
of	1
his,	1
as	1
generally	1
conceived,	1
something	1
very	1
like	1
a	1
moral	1
impossibility.	1
Please	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
I	1
mean	1
that	1
Boulnois	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
so	1
wicked.	1
Anybody	1
can	1
be	1
wicked--as	1
wicked	1
as	1
he	1
chooses.	1
We	1
can	1
direct	1
our	1
moral	1
wills;	1
but	1
we	1
can't	1
generally	1
change	1
our	1
instinctive	1
tastes	1
and	1
ways	1
of	1
doing	1
things.	1
Boulnois	1
might	1
commit	1
a	1
murder,	1
but	1
not	1
this	1
murder.	1
He	1
would	1
not	1
snatch	1
Romeo's	1
sword	1
from	1
its	1
romantic	1
scabbard;	1
or	1
slay	1
his	1
foe	1
on	1
the	1
sundial	1
as	1
on	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
altar;	1
or	1
leave	1
his	1
body	1
among	1
the	1
roses,	1
or	1
fling	1
the	1
sword	1
away	1
among	1
the	1
pines.	1
If	1
Boulnois	1
killed	1
anyone	1
he'd	1
do	1
it	1
quietly	1
and	1
heavily,	1
as	1
he'd	1
do	1
any	1
other	1
doubtful	1
thing--	1
take	1
a	1
tenth	1
glass	1
of	1
port,	1
or	1
read	1
a	1
loose	1
Greek	1
poet.	1
No,	1
the	1
romantic	1
setting	1
is	1
not	1
like	1
Boulnois.	1
It's	1
more	1
like	1
Champion."	1
"Ah!"	1
she	1
said,	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
eyes	1
like	1
diamonds.	1
"And	1
the	1
trivial	1
thing	1
was	1
this,"	1
said	1
Brown.	1
"There	1
were	1
finger-prints	1
on	1
that	1
sword;	1
finger-prints	1
can	1
be	1
detected	1
quite	1
a	1
time	1
after	1
they	1
are	1
made	1
if	1
they're	1
on	1
some	1
polished	1
surface	1
like	1
glass	1
or	1
steel.	1
These	1
were	1
on	1
a	1
polished	1
surface.	1
They	1
were	1
half-way	1
down	1
the	1
blade	1
of	1
the	1
sword.	1
Whose	1
prints	1
they	1
were	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
earthly	1
clue;	1
but	1
why	1
should	1
anybody	1
hold	1
a	1
sword	1
half-way	1
down?	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
long	1
sword,	1
but	1
length	1
is	1
an	1
advantage	1
in	1
lunging	1
at	1
an	1
enemy.	1
At	1
least,	1
at	1
most	1
enemies.	1
At	1
all	1
enemies	1
except	1
one."	1
"Except	1
one,"	1
she	1
repeated.	1
"There	1
is	1
only	1
one	1
enemy,"	1
said	1
Father	1
Brown,	1
"whom	1
it	1
is	1
easier	1
to	1
kill	1
with	1
a	1
dagger	1
than	1
a	1
sword."	1
"I	1
know,"	1
said	1
the	1
woman.	1
"Oneself."	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
long	1
silence,	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
priest	1
said	1
quietly	1
but	1
abruptly:	1
"Am	1
I	1
right,	1
then?	1
Did	1
Sir	1
Claude	1
kill	1
himself?"	1
"Yes"	1
she	1
said,	1
with	1
a	1
face	1
like	1
marble.	1
"I	1
saw	1
him	1
do	1
it."	1
"He	1
died,"	1
said	1
Father	1
Brown,	1
"for	1
love	1
of	1
you?"	1
An	1
extraordinary	1
expression	1
flashed	1
across	1
her	1
face,	1
very	1
different	1
from	1
pity,	1
modesty,	1
remorse,	1
or	1
anything	1
her	1
companion	1
had	1
expected:	1
her	1
voice	1
became	1
suddenly	1
strong	1
and	1
full.	1
"I	1
don't	1
believe,"	1
she	1
said,	1
"he	1
ever	1
cared	1
about	1
me	1
a	1
rap.	1
He	1
hated	1
my	1
husband."	1
"Why?"	1
asked	1
the	1
other,	1
and	1
turned	1
his	1
round	1
face	1
from	1
the	1
sky	1
to	1
the	1
lady.	1
"He	1
hated	1
my	1
husband	1
because...it	1
is	1
so	1
strange	1
I	1
hardly	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
say	1
it...because..."	1
"Yes?"	1
said	1
Brown	1
patiently.	1
"Because	1
my	1
husband	1
wouldn't	1
hate	1
him."	1
Father	1
Brown	1
only	1
nodded,	1
and	1
seemed	1
still	1
to	1
be	1
listening;	1
he	1
differed	1
from	1
most	1
detectives	1
in	1
fact	1
and	1
fiction	1
in	1
a	1
small	1
point--	1
he	1
never	1
pretended	1
not	1
to	1
understand	1
when	1
he	1
understood	1
perfectly	1
well.	1
Mrs	1
Boulnois	1
drew	1
near	1
once	1
more	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
contained	1
glow	1
of	1
certainty.	1
"My	1
husband,"	1
she	1
said,	1
"is	1
a	1
great	1
man.	1
Sir	1
Claude	1
Champion	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
great	1
man:	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
celebrated	1
and	1
successful	1
man.	1
My	1
husband	1
has	1
never	1
been	1
celebrated	1
or	1
successful;	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
solemn	1
truth	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
never	1
dreamed	1
of	1
being	1
so.	1
He	1
no	1
more	1
expects	1
to	1
be	1
famous	1
for	1
thinking	1
than	1
for	1
smoking	1
cigars.	1
On	1
all	1
that	1
side	1
he	1
has	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
splendid	1
stupidity.	1
He	1
has	1
never	1
grown	1
up.	1
He	1
still	1
liked	1
Champion	1
exactly	1
as	1
he	1
liked	1
him	1
at	1
school;	1
he	1
admired	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
would	1
admire	1
a	1
conjuring	1
trick	1
done	1
at	1
the	1
dinner-table.	1
But	1
he	1
couldn't	1
be	1
got	1
to	1
conceive	1
the	1
notion	1
of	1
envying	1
Champion.	1
And	1
Champion	1
wanted	1
to	1
be	1
envied.	1
He	1
went	1
mad	1
and	1
killed	1
himself	1
for	1
that."	1
"Yes,"	1
said	1
Father	1
Brown;	1
"I	1
think	1
I	1
begin	1
to	1
understand."	1
"Oh,	1
don't	1
you	1
see?"	1
she	1
cried;	1
"the	1
whole	1
picture	1
is	1
made	1
for	1
that--	1
the	1
place	1
is	1
planned	1
for	1
it.	1
Champion	1
put	1
John	1
in	1
a	1
little	1
house	1
at	1
his	1
very	1
door,	1
like	1
a	1
dependant--to	1
make	1
him	1
feel	1
a	1
failure.	1
He	1
never	1
felt	1
it.	1
He	1
thinks	1
no	1
more	1
about	1
such	1
things	1
than--	1
than	1
an	1
absent-minded	1
lion.	1
Champion	1
would	1
burst	1
in	1
on	1
John's	1
shabbiest	1
hours	1
or	1
homeliest	1
meals	1
with	1
some	1
dazzling	1
present	1
or	1
announcement	1
or	1
expedition	1
that	1
made	1
it	1
like	1
the	1
visit	1
of	1
Haroun	1
Alraschid,	1
and	1
John	1
would	1
accept	1
or	1
refuse	1
amiably	1
with	1
one	1
eye	1
off,	1
so	1
to	1
speak,	1
like	1
one	1
lazy	1
schoolboy	1
agreeing	1
or	1
disagreeing	1
with	1
another.	1
After	1
five	1
years	1
of	1
it	1
John	1
had	1
not	1
turned	1
a	1
hair;	1
and	1
Sir	1
Claude	1
Champion	1
was	1
a	1
monomaniac."	1
"And	1
Haman	1
began	1
to	1
tell	1
them,"	1
said	1
Father	1
Brown,	1
"of	1
all	1
the	1
things	1
wherein	1
the	1
king	1
had	1
honoured	1
him;	1
and	1
he	1
said:	1
`All	1
these	1
things	1
profit	1
me	1
nothing	1
while	1
I	1
see	1
Mordecai	1
the	1
Jew	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
gate.'"	1
"The	1
crisis	1
came,"	1
Mrs	1
Boulnois	1
continued,	1
"when	1
I	1
persuaded	1
John	1
to	1
let	1
me	1
take	1
down	1
some	1
of	1
his	1
speculations	1
and	1
send	1
them	1
to	1
a	1
magazine.	1
They	1
began	1
to	1
attract	1
attention,	1
especially	1
in	1
America,	1
and	1
one	1
paper	1
wanted	1
to	1
interview	1
him.	1
When	1
Champion	1
(who	1
was	1
interviewed	1
nearly	1
every	1
day)	1
heard	1
of	1
this	1
late	1
little	1
crumb	1
of	1
success	1
falling	1
to	1
his	1
unconscious	1
rival,	1
the	1
last	1
link	1
snapped	1
that	1
held	1
back	1
his	1
devilish	1
hatred.	1
Then	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
lay	1
that	1
insane	1
siege	1
to	1
my	1
own	1
love	1
and	1
honour	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
the	1
talk	1
of	1
the	1
shire.	1
You	1
will	1
ask	1
me	1
why	1
I	1
allowed	1
such	1
atrocious	1
attentions.	1
I	1
answer	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
declined	1
them	1
except	1
by	1
explaining	1
to	1
my	1
husband,	1
and	1
there	1
are	1
some	1
things	1
the	1
soul	1
cannot	1
do,	1
as	1
the	1
body	1
cannot	1
fly.	1
Nobody	1
could	1
have	1
explained	1
to	1
my	1
husband.	1
Nobody	1
could	1
do	1
it	1
now.	1
If	1
you	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
so	1
many	1
words,	1
`Champion	1
is	1
stealing	1
your	1
wife,'	1
he	1
would	1
think	1
the	1
joke	1
a	1
little	1
vulgar:	1
that	1
it	1
could	1
be	1
anything	1
but	1
a	1
joke--that	1
notion	1
could	1
find	1
no	1
crack	1
in	1
his	1
great	1
skull	1
to	1
get	1
in	1
by.	1
Well,	1
John	1
was	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
see	1
us	1
act	1
this	1
evening,	1
but	1
just	1
as	1
we	1
were	1
starting	1
he	1
said	1
he	1
wouldn't;	1
he	1
had	1
got	1
an	1
interesting	1
book	1
and	1
a	1
cigar.	1
I	1
told	1
this	1
to	1
Sir	1
Claude,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
his	1
death-blow.	1
The	1
monomaniac	1
suddenly	1
saw	1
despair.	1
He	1
stabbed	1
himself,	1
crying	1
out	1
like	1
a	1
devil	1
that	1
Boulnois	1
was	1
slaying	1
him;	1
he	1
lies	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
garden	1
dead	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
jealousy	1
to	1
produce	1
jealousy,	1
and	1
John	1
is	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
dining-room	1
reading	1
a	1
book."	1
There	1
was	1
another	1
silence,	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
little	1
priest	1
said:	1
"There	1
is	1
only	1
one	1
weak	1
point,	1
Mrs	1
Boulnois,	1
in	1
all	1
your	1
very	1
vivid	1
account.	1
Your	1
husband	1
is	1
not	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
dining-room	1
reading	1
a	1
book.	1
That	1
American	1
reporter	1
told	1
me	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
to	1
your	1
house,	1
and	1
your	1
butler	1
told	1
him	1
Mr	1
Boulnois	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
Pendragon	1
Park	1
after	1
all."	1
Her	1
bright	1
eyes	1
widened	1
to	1
an	1
almost	1
electric	1
glare;	1
and	1
yet	1
it	1
seemed	1
rather	1
bewilderment	1
than	1
confusion	1
or	1
fear.	1
"Why,	1
what	1
can	1
you	1
mean?"	1
she	1
cried.	1
"All	1
the	1
servants	1
were	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
seeing	1
the	1
theatricals.	1
And	1
we	1
don't	1
keep	1
a	1
butler,	1
thank	1
goodness!"	1
Father	1
Brown	1
started	1
and	1
spun	1
half	1
round	1
like	1
an	1
absurd	1
teetotum.	1
"What,	1
what?"	1
he	1
cried	1
seeming	1
galvanized	1
into	1
sudden	1
life.	1
"Look	1
here--I	1
say--can	1
I	1
make	1
your	1
husband	1
hear	1
if	1
I	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
house?"	1
"Oh,	1
the	1
servants	1
will	1
be	1
back	1
by	1
now,"	1
she	1
said,	1
wondering.	1
"Right,	1
right!"	1
rejoined	1
the	1
cleric	1
energetically,	1
and	1
set	1
off	1
scuttling	1
up	1
the	1
path	1
towards	1
the	1
Park	1
gates.	1
He	1
turned	1
once	1
to	1
say:	1
"Better	1
get	1
hold	1
of	1
that	1
Yankee,	1
or	1
`Crime	1
of	1
John	1
Boulnois'	1
will	1
be	1
all	1
over	1
the	1
Republic	1
in	1
large	1
letters."	1
"You	1
don't	1
understand,"	1
said	1
Mrs	1
Boulnois.	1
"He	1
wouldn't	1
mind.	1
I	1
don't	1
think	1
he	1
imagines	1
that	1
America	1
really	1
is	1
a	1
place."	1
When	1
Father	1
Brown	1
reached	1
the	1
house	1
with	1
the	1
beehive	1
and	1
the	1
drowsy	1
dog,	1
a	1
small	1
and	1
neat	1
maid-servant	1
showed	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
dining-room,	1
where	1
Boulnois	1
sat	1
reading	1
by	1
a	1
shaded	1
lamp,	1
exactly	1
as	1
his	1
wife	1
described	1
him.	1
A	1
decanter	1
of	1
port	1
and	1
a	1
wineglass	1
were	1
at	1
his	1
elbow;	1
and	1
the	1
instant	1
the	1
priest	1
entered	1
he	1
noted	1
the	1
long	1
ash	1
stand	1
out	1
unbroken	1
on	1
his	1
cigar.	1
"He	1
has	1
been	1
here	1
for	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
at	1
least,"	1
thought	1
Father	1
Brown.	1
In	1
fact,	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
air	1
of	1
sitting	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
sat	1
when	1
his	1
dinner	1
was	1
cleared	1
away.	1
"Don't	1
get	1
up,	1
Mr	1
Boulnois,"	1
said	1
the	1
priest	1
in	1
his	1
pleasant,	1
prosaic	1
way.	1
"I	1
shan't	1
interrupt	1
you	1
a	1
moment.	1
I	1
fear	1
I	1
break	1
in	1
on	1
some	1
of	1
your	1
scientific	1
studies."	1
"No,"	1
said	1
Boulnois;	1
"I	1
was	1
reading	1
`The	1
Bloody	1
Thumb.'"	1
He	1
said	1
it	1
with	1
neither	1
frown	1
nor	1
smile,	1
and	1
his	1
visitor	1
was	1
conscious	1
of	1
a	1
certain	1
deep	1
and	1
virile	1
indifference	1
in	1
the	1
man	1
which	1
his	1
wife	1
had	1
called	1
greatness.	1
He	1
laid	1
down	1
a	1
gory	1
yellow	1
"shocker"	1
without	1
even	1
feeling	1
its	1
incongruity	1
enough	1
to	1
comment	1
on	1
it	1
humorously.	1
John	1
Boulnois	1
was	1
a	1
big,	1
slow-moving	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
massive	1
head,	1
partly	1
grey	1
and	1
partly	1
bald,	1
and	1
blunt,	1
burly	1
features.	1
He	1
was	1
in	1
shabby	1
and	1
very	1
old-fashioned	1
evening-dress,	1
with	1
a	1
narrow	1
triangular	1
opening	1
of	1
shirt-front:	1
he	1
had	1
assumed	1
it	1
that	1
evening	1
in	1
his	1
original	1
purpose	1
of	1
going	1
to	1
see	1
his	1
wife	1
act	1
Juliet.	1
"I	1
won't	1
keep	1
you	1
long	1
from	1
`The	1
Bloody	1
Thumb'	1
or	1
any	1
other	1
catastrophic	1
affairs,"	1
said	1
Father	1
Brown,	1
smiling.	1
"I	1
only	1
came	1
to	1
ask	1
you	1
about	1
the	1
crime	1
you	1
committed	1
this	1
evening."	1
Boulnois	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
steadily,	1
but	1
a	1
red	1
bar	1
began	1
to	1
show	1
across	1
his	1
broad	1
brow;	1
and	1
he	1
seemed	1
like	1
one	1
discovering	1
embarrassment	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time.	1
"I	1
know	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
strange	1
crime,"	1
assented	1
Brown	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice.	1
"Stranger	1
than	1
murder	1
perhaps--to	1
you.	1
The	1
little	1
sins	1
are	1
sometimes	1
harder	1
to	1
confess	1
than	1
the	1
big	1
ones--but	1
that's	1
why	1
it's	1
so	1
important	1
to	1
confess	1
them.	1
Your	1
crime	1
is	1
committed	1
by	1
every	1
fashionable	1
hostess	1
six	1
times	1
a	1
week:	1
and	1
yet	1
you	1
find	1
it	1
sticks	1
to	1
your	1
tongue	1
like	1
a	1
nameless	1
atrocity."	1
"It	1
makes	1
one	1
feel,"	1
said	1
the	1
philosopher	1
slowly,	1
"such	1
a	1
damned	1
fool."	1
"I	1
know,"	1
assented	1
the	1
other,	1
"but	1
one	1
often	1
has	1
to	1
choose	1
between	1
feeling	1
a	1
damned	1
fool	1
and	1
being	1
one."	1
"I	1
can't	1
analyse	1
myself	1
well,"	1
went	1
on	1
Boulnois;	1
"but	1
sitting	1
in	1
that	1
chair	1
with	1
that	1
story	1
I	1
was	1
as	1
happy	1
as	1
a	1
schoolboy	1
on	1
a	1
half-holiday.	1
It	1
was	1
security,	1
eternity--I	1
can't	1
convey	1
it...	1
the	1
cigars	1
were	1
within	1
reach...the	1
matches	1
were	1
within	1
reach...	1
the	1
Thumb	1
had	1
four	1
more	1
appearances	1
to...it	1
was	1
not	1
only	1
a	1
peace,	1
but	1
a	1
plenitude.	1
Then	1
that	1
bell	1
rang,	1
and	1
I	1
thought	1
for	1
one	1
long,	1
mortal	1
minute	1
that	1
I	1
couldn't	1
get	1
out	1
of	1
that	1
chair--literally,	1
physically,	1
muscularly	1
couldn't.	1
Then	1
I	1
did	1
it	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
lifting	1
the	1
world,	1
because	1
I	1
knew	1
all	1
the	1
servants	1
were	1
out.	1
I	1
opened	1
the	1
front	1
door,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
man	1
with	1
his	1
mouth	1
open	1
to	1
speak	1
and	1
his	1
notebook	1
open	1
to	1
write	1
in.	1
I	1
remembered	1
the	1
Yankee	1
interviewer	1
I	1
had	1
forgotten.	1
His	1
hair	1
was	1
parted	1
in	1
the	1
middle,	1
and	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
murder--"	1
"I	1
understand,"	1
said	1
Father	1
Brown.	1
"I've	1
seen	1
him."	1
"I	1
didn't	1
commit	1
murder,"	1
continued	1
the	1
Catastrophist	1
mildly,	1
"but	1
only	1
perjury.	1
I	1
said	1
I	1
had	1
gone	1
across	1
to	1
Pendragon	1
Park	1
and	1
shut	1
the	1
door	1
in	1
his	1
face.	1
That	1
is	1
my	1
crime,	1
Father	1
Brown,	1
and	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
what	1
penance	1
you	1
would	1
inflict	1
for	1
it."	1
"I	1
shan't	1
inflict	1
any	1
penance,"	1
said	1
the	1
clerical	1
gentleman,	1
collecting	1
his	1
heavy	1
hat	1
and	1
umbrella	1
with	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
some	1
amusement;	1
"quite	1
the	1
contrary.	1
I	1
came	1
here	1
specially	1
to	1
let	1
you	1
off	1
the	1
little	1
penance	1
which	1
would	1
otherwise	1
have	1
followed	1
your	1
little	1
offence."	1
"And	1
what,"	1
asked	1
Boulnois,	1
smiling,	1
"is	1
the	1
little	1
penance	1
I	1
have	1
so	1
luckily	1
been	1
let	1
off?"	1
"Being	1
hanged,"	1
said	1
Father	1
Brown.	1
XII.	1
The	1
Fairy	1
Tale	1
of	1
Father	1
Brown	1
THE	1
picturesque	1
city	1
and	1
state	1
of	1
Heiligwaldenstein	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
toy	1
kingdoms	1
of	1
which	1
certain	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
German	1
Empire	1
still	1
consist.	1
It	1
had	1
come	1
under	1
the	1
Prussian	1
hegemony	1
quite	1
late	1
in	1
history--	1
hardly	1
fifty	1
years	1
before	1
the	1
fine	1
summer	1
day	1
when	1
Flambeau	1
and	1
Father	1
Brown	1
found	1
themselves	1
sitting	1
in	1
its	1
gardens	1
and	1
drinking	1
its	1
beer.	1
There	1
had	1
been	1
not	1
a	1
little	1
of	1
war	1
and	1
wild	1
justice	1
there	1
within	1
living	1
memory,	1
as	1
soon	1
will	1
be	1
shown.	1
But	1
in	1
merely	1
looking	1
at	1
it	1
one	1
could	1
not	1
dismiss	1
that	1
impression	1
of	1
childishness	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
most	1
charming	1
side	1
of	1
Germany--those	1
little	1
pantomime,	1
paternal	1
monarchies	1
in	1
which	1
a	1
king	1
seems	1
as	1
domestic	1
as	1
a	1
cook.	1
The	1
German	1
soldiers	1
by	1
the	1
innumerable	1
sentry-boxes	1
looked	1
strangely	1
like	1
German	1
toys,	1
and	1
the	1
clean-cut	1
battlements	1
of	1
the	1
castle,	1
gilded	1
by	1
the	1
sunshine,	1
looked	1
the	1
more	1
like	1
the	1
gilt	1
gingerbread.	1
For	1
it	1
was	1
brilliant	1
weather.	1
The	1
sky	1
was	1
as	1
Prussian	1
a	1
blue	1
as	1
Potsdam	1
itself	1
could	1
require,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
yet	1
more	1
like	1
that	1
lavish	1
and	1
glowing	1
use	1
of	1
the	1
colour	1
which	1
a	1
child	1
extracts	1
from	1
a	1
shilling	1
paint-box.	1
Even	1
the	1
grey-ribbed	1
trees	1
looked	1
young,	1
for	1
the	1
pointed	1
buds	1
on	1
them	1
were	1
still	1
pink,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
pattern	1
against	1
the	1
strong	1
blue	1
looked	1
like	1
innumerable	1
childish	1
figures.	1
Despite	1
his	1
prosaic	1
appearance	1
and	1
generally	1
practical	1
walk	1
of	1
life,	1
Father	1
Brown	1
was	1
not	1
without	1
a	1
certain	1
streak	1
of	1
romance	1
in	1
his	1
composition,	1
though	1
he	1
generally	1
kept	1
his	1
daydreams	1
to	1
himself,	1
as	1
many	1
children	1
do.	1
Amid	1
the	1
brisk,	1
bright	1
colours	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
day,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
heraldic	1
framework	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
town,	1
he	1
did	1
feel	1
rather	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
entered	1
a	1
fairy	1
tale.	1
He	1
took	1
a	1
childish	1
pleasure,	1
as	1
a	1
younger	1
brother	1
might,	1
in	1
the	1
formidable	1
sword-stick	1
which	1
Flambeau	1
always	1
flung	1
as	1
he	1
walked,	1
and	1
which	1
now	1
stood	1
upright	1
beside	1
his	1
tall	1
mug	1
of	1
Munich.	1
Nay,	1
in	1
his	1
sleepy	1
irresponsibility,	1
he	1
even	1
found	1
himself	1
eyeing	1
the	1
knobbed	1
and	1
clumsy	1
head	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
shabby	1
umbrella,	1
with	1
some	1
faint	1
memories	1
of	1
the	1
ogre's	1
club	1
in	1
a	1
coloured	1
toy-book.	1
But	1
he	1
never	1
composed	1
anything	1
in	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
fiction,	1
unless	1
it	1
be	1
the	1
tale	1
that	1
follows:	1
"I	1
wonder,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"whether	1
one	1
would	1
have	1
real	1
adventures	1
in	1
a	1
place	1
like	1
this,	1
if	1
one	1
put	1
oneself	1
in	1
the	1
way?	1
It's	1
a	1
splendid	1
back-scene	1
for	1
them,	1
but	1
I	1
always	1
have	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
feeling	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
fight	1
you	1
with	1
pasteboard	1
sabres	1
more	1
than	1
real,	1
horrible	1
swords."	1
"You	1
are	1
mistaken,"	1
said	1
his	1
friend.	1
"In	1
this	1
place	1
they	1
not	1
only	1
fight	1
with	1
swords,	1
but	1
kill	1
without	1
swords.	1
And	1
there's	1
worse	1
than	1
that."	1
"Why,	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
mean?"	1
asked	1
Father	1
Brown.	1
"Why,"	1
replied	1
the	1
other,	1
"I	1
should	1
say	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
place	1
in	1
Europe	1
where	1
a	1
man	1
was	1
ever	1
shot	1
without	1
firearms."	1
"Do	1
you	1
mean	1
a	1
bow	1
and	1
arrow?"	1
asked	1
Brown	1
in	1
some	1
wonder.	1
"I	1
mean	1
a	1
bullet	1
in	1
the	1
brain,"	1
replied	1
Flambeau.	1
"Don't	1
you	1
know	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
the	1
late	1
Prince	1
of	1
this	1
place?	1
It	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
police	1
mysteries	1
about	1
twenty	1
years	1
ago.	1
You	1
remember,	1
of	1
course,	1
that	1
this	1
place	1
was	1
forcibly	1
annexed	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
Bismarck's	1
very	1
earliest	1
schemes	1
of	1
consolidation--	1
forcibly,	1
that	1
is,	1
but	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
easily.	1
The	1
empire	1
(or	1
what	1
wanted	1
to	1
be	1
one)	1
sent	1
Prince	1
Otto	1
of	1
Grossenmark	1
to	1
rule	1
the	1
place	1
in	1
the	1
Imperial	1
interests.	1
We	1
saw	1
his	1
portrait	1
in	1
the	1
gallery	1
there--	1
a	1
handsome	1
old	1
gentleman	1
if	1
he'd	1
had	1
any	1
hair	1
or	1
eyebrows,	1
and	1
hadn't	1
been	1
wrinkled	1
all	1
over	1
like	1
a	1
vulture;	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
things	1
to	1
harass	1
him,	1
as	1
I'll	1
explain	1
in	1
a	1
minute.	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
soldier	1
of	1
distinguished	1
skill	1
and	1
success,	1
but	1
he	1
didn't	1
have	1
altogether	1
an	1
easy	1
job	1
with	1
this	1
little	1
place.	1
He	1
was	1
defeated	1
in	1
several	1
battles	1
by	1
the	1
celebrated	1
Arnhold	1
brothers--the	1
three	1
guerrilla	1
patriots	1
to	1
whom	1
Swinburne	1
wrote	1
a	1
poem,	1
you	1
remember:	1
Wolves	1
with	1
the	1
hair	1
of	1
the	1
ermine,	1
Crows	1
that	1
are	1
crowned	1
and	1
kings--	1
These	1
things	1
be	1
many	1
as	1
vermin,	1
Yet	1
Three	1
shall	1
abide	1
these	1
things.	1
Or	1
something	1
of	1
that	1
kind.	1
Indeed,	1
it	1
is	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
certain	1
that	1
the	1
occupation	1
would	1
ever	1
have	1
been	1
successful	1
had	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
three	1
brothers,	1
Paul,	1
despicably,	1
but	1
very	1
decisively	1
declined	1
to	1
abide	1
these	1
things	1
any	1
longer,	1
and,	1
by	1
surrendering	1
all	1
the	1
secrets	1
of	1
the	1
insurrection,	1
ensured	1
its	1
overthrow	1
and	1
his	1
own	1
ultimate	1
promotion	1
to	1
the	1
post	1
of	1
chamberlain	1
to	1
Prince	1
Otto.	1
After	1
this,	1
Ludwig,	1
the	1
one	1
genuine	1
hero	1
among	1
Mr	1
Swinburne's	1
heroes,	1
was	1
killed,	1
sword	1
in	1
hand,	1
in	1
the	1
capture	1
of	1
the	1
city;	1
and	1
the	1
third,	1
Heinrich,	1
who,	1
though	1
not	1
a	1
traitor,	1
had	1
always	1
been	1
tame	1
and	1
even	1
timid	1
compared	1
with	1
his	1
active	1
brothers,	1
retired	1
into	1
something	1
like	1
a	1
hermitage,	1
became	1
converted	1
to	1
a	1
Christian	1
quietism	1
which	1
was	1
almost	1
Quakerish,	1
and	1
never	1
mixed	1
with	1
men	1
except	1
to	1
give	1
nearly	1
all	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
the	1
poor.	1
They	1
tell	1
me	1
that	1
not	1
long	1
ago	1
he	1
could	1
still	1
be	1
seen	1
about	1
the	1
neighbourhood	1
occasionally,	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
a	1
black	1
cloak,	1
nearly	1
blind,	1
with	1
very	1
wild,	1
white	1
hair,	1
but	1
a	1
face	1
of	1
astonishing	1
softness."	1
"I	1
know,"	1
said	1
Father	1
Brown.	1
"I	1
saw	1
him	1
once."	1
His	1
friend	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
in	1
some	1
surprise.	1
"I	1
didn't	1
know	1
you'd	1
been	1
here	1
before,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"Perhaps	1
you	1
know	1
as	1
much	1
about	1
it	1
as	1
I	1
do.	1
Anyhow,	1
that's	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
the	1
Arnholds,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
last	1
survivor	1
of	1
them.	1
Yes,	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
who	1
played	1
parts	1
in	1
that	1
drama."	1
"You	1
mean	1
that	1
the	1
Prince,	1
too,	1
died	1
long	1
before?"	1
"Died,"	1
repeated	1
Flambeau,	1
"and	1
that's	1
about	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
we	1
can	1
say.	1
You	1
must	1
understand	1
that	1
towards	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
have	1
those	1
tricks	1
of	1
the	1
nerves	1
not	1
uncommon	1
with	1
tyrants.	1
He	1
multiplied	1
the	1
ordinary	1
daily	1
and	1
nightly	1
guard	1
round	1
his	1
castle	1
till	1
there	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
more	1
sentry-boxes	1
than	1
houses	1
in	1
the	1
town,	1
and	1
doubtful	1
characters	1
were	1
shot	1
without	1
mercy.	1
He	1
lived	1
almost	1
entirely	1
in	1
a	1
little	1
room	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
centre	1
of	1
the	1
enormous	1
labyrinth	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
other	1
rooms,	1
and	1
even	1
in	1
this	1
he	1
erected	1
another	1
sort	1
of	1
central	1
cabin	1
or	1
cupboard,	1
lined	1
with	1
steel,	1
like	1
a	1
safe	1
or	1
a	1
battleship.	1
Some	1
say	1
that	1
under	1
the	1
floor	1
of	1
this	1
again	1
was	1
a	1
secret	1
hole	1
in	1
the	1
earth,	1
no	1
more	1
than	1
large	1
enough	1
to	1
hold	1
him,	1
so	1
that,	1
in	1
his	1
anxiety	1
to	1
avoid	1
the	1
grave,	1
he	1
was	1
willing	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
a	1
place	1
pretty	1
much	1
like	1
it.	1
But	1
he	1
went	1
further	1
yet.	1
The	1
populace	1
had	1
been	1
supposed	1
to	1
be	1
disarmed	1
ever	1
since	1
the	1
suppression	1
of	1
the	1
revolt,	1
but	1
Otto	1
now	1
insisted,	1
as	1
governments	1
very	1
seldom	1
insist,	1
on	1
an	1
absolute	1
and	1
literal	1
disarmament.	1
It	1
was	1
carried	1
out,	1
with	1
extraordinary	1
thoroughness	1
and	1
severity,	1
by	1
very	1
well-organized	1
officials	1
over	1
a	1
small	1
and	1
familiar	1
area,	1
and,	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
human	1
strength	1
and	1
science	1
can	1
be	1
absolutely	1
certain	1
of	1
anything,	1
Prince	1
Otto	1
was	1
absolutely	1
certain	1
that	1
nobody	1
could	1
introduce	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
a	1
toy	1
pistol	1
into	1
Heiligwaldenstein."	1
"Human	1
science	1
can	1
never	1
be	1
quite	1
certain	1
of	1
things	1
like	1
that,"	1
said	1
Father	1
Brown,	1
still	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
red	1
budding	1
of	1
the	1
branches	1
over	1
his	1
head,	1
"if	1
only	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
difficulty	1
about	1
definition	1
and	1
connotation.	1
What	1
is	1
a	1
weapon?	1
People	1
have	1
been	1
murdered	1
with	1
the	1
mildest	1
domestic	1
comforts;	1
certainly	1
with	1
tea-kettles,	1
probably	1
with	1
tea-cosies.	1
On	1
the	1
other	1
hand,	1
if	1
you	1
showed	1
an	1
Ancient	1
Briton	1
a	1
revolver,	1
I	1
doubt	1
if	1
he	1
would	1
know	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
weapon--	1
until	1
it	1
was	1
fired	1
into	1
him,	1
of	1
course.	1
Perhaps	1
somebody	1
introduced	1
a	1
firearm	1
so	1
new	1
that	1
it	1
didn't	1
even	1
look	1
like	1
a	1
firearm.	1
Perhaps	1
it	1
looked	1
like	1
a	1
thimble	1
or	1
something.	1
Was	1
the	1
bullet	1
at	1
all	1
peculiar?"	1
"Not	1
that	1
I	1
ever	1
heard	1
of,"	1
answered	1
Flambeau;	1
"but	1
my	1
information	1
is	1
fragmentary,	1
and	1
only	1
comes	1
from	1
my	1
old	1
friend	1
Grimm.	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
able	1
detective	1
in	1
the	1
German	1
service,	1
and	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
arrest	1
me;	1
I	1
arrested	1
him	1
instead,	1
and	1
we	1
had	1
many	1
interesting	1
chats.	1
He	1
was	1
in	1
charge	1
here	1
of	1
the	1
inquiry	1
about	1
Prince	1
Otto,	1
but	1
I	1
forgot	1
to	1
ask	1
him	1
anything	1
about	1
the	1
bullet.	1
According	1
to	1
Grimm,	1
what	1
happened	1
was	1
this."	1
He	1
paused	1
a	1
moment	1
to	1
drain	1
the	1
greater	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
dark	1
lager	1
at	1
a	1
draught,	1
and	1
then	1
resumed:	1
"On	1
the	1
evening	1
in	1
question,	1
it	1
seems,	1
the	1
Prince	1
was	1
expected	1
to	1
appear	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
outer	1
rooms,	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
receive	1
certain	1
visitors	1
whom	1
he	1
really	1
wished	1
to	1
meet.	1
They	1
were	1
geological	1
experts	1
sent	1
to	1
investigate	1
the	1
old	1
question	1
of	1
the	1
alleged	1
supply	1
of	1
gold	1
from	1
the	1
rocks	1
round	1
here,	1
upon	1
which	1
(as	1
it	1
was	1
said)	1
the	1
small	1
city-state	1
had	1
so	1
long	1
maintained	1
its	1
credit	1
and	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
negotiate	1
with	1
its	1
neighbours	1
even	1
under	1
the	1
ceaseless	1
bombardment	1
of	1
bigger	1
armies.	1
Hitherto	1
it	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
found	1
by	1
the	1
most	1
exacting	1
inquiry	1
which	1
could--"	1
"Which	1
could	1
be	1
quite	1
certain	1
of	1
discovering	1
a	1
toy	1
pistol,"	1
said	1
Father	1
Brown	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
"But	1
what	1
about	1
the	1
brother	1
who	1
ratted?	1
Hadn't	1
he	1
anything	1
to	1
tell	1
the	1
Prince?"	1
"He	1
always	1
asseverated	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know,"	1
replied	1
Flambeau;	1
"that	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
one	1
secret	1
his	1
brothers	1
had	1
not	1
told	1
him.	1
It	1
is	1
only	1
right	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
it	1
received	1
some	1
support	1
from	1
fragmentary	1
words--spoken	1
by	1
the	1
great	1
Ludwig	1
in	1
the	1
hour	1
of	1
death,	1
when	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
Heinrich	1
but	1
pointed	1
at	1
Paul,	1
and	1
said,	1
`You	1
have	1
not	1
told	1
him...'	1
and	1
was	1
soon	1
afterwards	1
incapable	1
of	1
speech.	1
Anyhow,	1
the	1
deputation	1
of	1
distinguished	1
geologists	1
and	1
mineralogists	1
from	1
Paris	1
and	1
Berlin	1
were	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
magnificent	1
and	1
appropriate	1
dress,	1
for	1
there	1
are	1
no	1
men	1
who	1
like	1
wearing	1
their	1
decorations	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
science--as	1
anybody	1
knows	1
who	1
has	1
ever	1
been	1
to	1
a	1
soiree	1
of	1
the	1
Royal	1
Society.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
brilliant	1
gathering,	1
but	1
very	1
late,	1
and	1
gradually	1
the	1
Chamberlain--you	1
saw	1
his	1
portrait,	1
too:	1
a	1
man	1
with	1
black	1
eyebrows,	1
serious	1
eyes,	1
and	1
a	1
meaningless	1
sort	1
of	1
smile	1
underneath--the	1
Chamberlain,	1
I	1
say,	1
discovered	1
there	1
was	1
everything	1
there	1
except	1
the	1
Prince	1
himself.	1
He	1
searched	1
all	1
the	1
outer	1
salons;	1
then,	1
remembering	1
the	1
man's	1
mad	1
fits	1
of	1
fear,	1
hurried	1
to	1
the	1
inmost	1
chamber.	1
That	1
also	1
was	1
empty,	1
but	1
the	1
steel	1
turret	1
or	1
cabin	1
erected	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
it	1
took	1
some	1
time	1
to	1
open.	1
When	1
it	1
did	1
open	1
it	1
was	1
empty,	1
too.	1
He	1
went	1
and	1
looked	1
into	1
the	1
hole	1
in	1
the	1
ground,	1
which	1
seemed	1
deeper	1
and	1
somehow	1
all	1
the	1
more	1
like	1
a	1
grave--that	1
is	1
his	1
account,	1
of	1
course.	1
And	1
even	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
so	1
he	1
heard	1
a	1
burst	1
of	1
cries	1
and	1
tumult	1
in	1
the	1
long	1
rooms	1
and	1
corridors	1
without.	1
"First	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
distant	1
din	1
and	1
thrill	1
of	1
something	1
unthinkable	1
on	1
the	1
horizon	1
of	1
the	1
crowd,	1
even	1
beyond	1
the	1
castle.	1
Next	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
wordless	1
clamour	1
startlingly	1
close,	1
and	1
loud	1
enough	1
to	1
be	1
distinct	1
if	1
each	1
word	1
had	1
not	1
killed	1
the	1
other.	1
Next	1
came	1
words	1
of	1
a	1
terrible	1
clearness,	1
coming	1
nearer,	1
and	1
next	1
one	1
man,	1
rushing	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
telling	1
the	1
news	1
as	1
briefly	1
as	1
such	1
news	1
is	1
told.	1
"Otto,	1
Prince	1
of	1
Heiligwaldenstein	1
and	1
Grossenmark,	1
was	1
lying	1
in	1
the	1
dews	1
of	1
the	1
darkening	1
twilight	1
in	1
the	1
woods	1
beyond	1
the	1
castle,	1
with	1
his	1
arms	1
flung	1
out	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
flung	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
moon.	1
The	1
blood	1
still	1
pulsed	1
from	1
his	1
shattered	1
temple	1
and	1
jaw,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
part	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
moved	1
like	1
a	1
living	1
thing.	1
He	1
was	1
clad	1
in	1
his	1
full	1
white	1
and	1
yellow	1
uniform,	1
as	1
to	1
receive	1
his	1
guests	1
within,	1
except	1
that	1
the	1
sash	1
or	1
scarf	1
had	1
been	1
unbound	1
and	1
lay	1
rather	1
crumpled	1
by	1
his	1
side.	1
Before	1
he	1
could	1
be	1
lifted	1
he	1
was	1
dead.	1
But,	1
dead	1
or	1
alive,	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
riddle--he	1
who	1
had	1
always	1
hidden	1
in	1
the	1
inmost	1
chamber	1
out	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
wet	1
woods,	1
unarmed	1
and	1
alone."	1
"Who	1
found	1
his	1
body?"	1
asked	1
Father	1
Brown.	1
"Some	1
girl	1
attached	1
to	1
the	1
Court	1
named	1
Hedwig	1
von	1
something	1
or	1
other,"	1
replied	1
his	1
friend,	1
"who	1
had	1
been	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
wood	1
picking	1
wild	1
flowers."	1
"Had	1
she	1
picked	1
any?"	1
asked	1
the	1
priest,	1
staring	1
rather	1
vacantly	1
at	1
the	1
veil	1
of	1
the	1
branches	1
above	1
him.	1
"Yes,"	1
replied	1
Flambeau.	1
"I	1
particularly	1
remember	1
that	1
the	1
Chamberlain,	1
or	1
old	1
Grimm	1
or	1
somebody,	1
said	1
how	1
horrible	1
it	1
was,	1
when	1
they	1
came	1
up	1
at	1
her	1
call,	1
to	1
see	1
a	1
girl	1
holding	1
spring	1
flowers	1
and	1
bending	1
over	1
that--that	1
bloody	1
collapse.	1
However,	1
the	1
main	1
point	1
is	1
that	1
before	1
help	1
arrived	1
he	1
was	1
dead,	1
and	1
the	1
news,	1
of	1
course,	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
carried	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
castle.	1
The	1
consternation	1
it	1
created	1
was	1
something	1
beyond	1
even	1
that	1
natural	1
in	1
a	1
Court	1
at	1
the	1
fall	1
of	1
a	1
potentate.	1
The	1
foreign	1
visitors,	1
especially	1
the	1
mining	1
experts,	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
wildest	1
doubt	1
and	1
excitement,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
many	1
important	1
Prussian	1
officials,	1
and	1
it	1
soon	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
clear	1
that	1
the	1
scheme	1
for	1
finding	1
the	1
treasure	1
bulked	1
much	1
bigger	1
in	1
the	1
business	1
than	1
people	1
had	1
supposed.	1
Experts	1
and	1
officials	1
had	1
been	1
promised	1
great	1
prizes	1
or	1
international	1
advantages,	1
and	1
some	1
even	1
said	1
that	1
the	1
Prince's	1
secret	1
apartments	1
and	1
strong	1
military	1
protection	1
were	1
due	1
less	1
to	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
populace	1
than	1
to	1
the	1
pursuit	1
of	1
some	1
private	1
investigation	1
of--"	1
"Had	1
the	1
flowers	1
got	1
long	1
stalks?"	1
asked	1
Father	1
Brown.	1
Flambeau	1
stared	1
at	1
him.	1
"What	1
an	1
odd	1
person	1
you	1
are!"	1
he	1
said.	1
"That's	1
exactly	1
what	1
old	1
Grimm	1
said.	1
He	1
said	1
the	1
ugliest	1
part	1
of	1
it,	1
he	1
thought--uglier	1
than	1
the	1
blood	1
and	1
bullet--was	1
that	1
the	1
flowers	1
were	1
quite	1
short,	1
plucked	1
close	1
under	1
the	1
head."	1
"Of	1
course,"	1
said	1
the	1
priest,	1
"when	1
a	1
grown	1
up	1
girl	1
is	1
really	1
picking	1
flowers,	1
she	1
picks	1
them	1
with	1
plenty	1
of	1
stalk.	1
If	1
she	1
just	1
pulled	1
their	1
heads	1
off,	1
as	1
a	1
child	1
does,	1
it	1
looks	1
as	1
if--"	1
And	1
he	1
hesitated.	1
"Well?"	1
inquired	1
the	1
other.	1
"Well,	1
it	1
looks	1
rather	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
snatched	1
them	1
nervously,	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
excuse	1
for	1
being	1
there	1
after--well,	1
after	1
she	1
was	1
there."	1
"I	1
know	1
what	1
you're	1
driving	1
at,"	1
said	1
Flambeau	1
rather	1
gloomily.	1
"But	1
that	1
and	1
every	1
other	1
suspicion	1
breaks	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
one	1
point--	1
the	1
want	1
of	1
a	1
weapon.	1
He	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
killed,	1
as	1
you	1
say,	1
with	1
lots	1
of	1
other	1
things--even	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
military	1
sash;	1
but	1
we	1
have	1
to	1
explain	1
not	1
bow	1
he	1
was	1
killed,	1
but	1
how	1
he	1
was	1
shot.	1
And	1
the	1
fact	1
is	1
we	1
can't.	1
They	1
had	1
the	1
girl	1
most	1
ruthlessly	1
searched;	1
for,	1
to	1
tell	1
the	1
truth,	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
suspect,	1
though	1
the	1
niece	1
and	1
ward	1
of	1
the	1
wicked	1
old	1
Chamberlain,	1
Paul	1
Arnhold.	1
But	1
she	1
was	1
very	1
romantic,	1
and	1
was	1
suspected	1
of	1
sympathy	1
with	1
the	1
old	1
revolutionary	1
enthusiasm	1
in	1
her	1
family.	1
All	1
the	1
same,	1
however	1
romantic	1
you	1
are,	1
you	1
can't	1
imagine	1
a	1
big	1
bullet	1
into	1
a	1
man's	1
jaw	1
or	1
brain	1
without	1
using	1
a	1
gun	1
or	1
pistol.	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
pistol,	1
though	1
there	1
were	1
two	1
pistol	1
shots.	1
I	1
leave	1
it	1
to	1
you,	1
my	1
friend."	1
"How	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
there	1
were	1
two	1
shots?"	1
asked	1
the	1
little	1
priest.	1
"There	1
was	1
only	1
one	1
in	1
his	1
head,"	1
said	1
his	1
companion,	1
"but	1
there	1
was	1
another	1
bullet-hole	1
in	1
the	1
sash."	1
Father	1
Brown's	1
smooth	1
brow	1
became	1
suddenly	1
constricted.	1
"Was	1
the	1
other	1
bullet	1
found?"	1
he	1
demanded.	1
Flambeau	1
started	1
a	1
little.	1
"I	1
don't	1
think	1
I	1
remember,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"Hold	1
on!	1
Hold	1
on!	1
Hold	1
on!"	1
cried	1
Brown,	1
frowning	1
more	1
and	1
more,	1
with	1
a	1
quite	1
unusual	1
concentration	1
of	1
curiosity.	1
"Don't	1
think	1
me	1
rude.	1
Let	1
me	1
think	1
this	1
out	1
for	1
a	1
moment."	1
"All	1
right,"	1
said	1
Flambeau,	1
laughing,	1
and	1
finished	1
his	1
beer.	1
A	1
slight	1
breeze	1
stirred	1
the	1
budding	1
trees	1
and	1
blew	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
sky	1
cloudlets	1
of	1
white	1
and	1
pink	1
that	1
seemed	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
sky	1
bluer	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
coloured	1
scene	1
more	1
quaint.	1
They	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
cherubs	1
flying	1
home	1
to	1
the	1
casements	1
of	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
celestial	1
nursery.	1
The	1
oldest	1
tower	1
of	1
the	1
castle,	1
the	1
Dragon	1
Tower,	1
stood	1
up	1
as	1
grotesque	1
as	1
the	1
ale-mug,	1
but	1
as	1
homely.	1
Only	1
beyond	1
the	1
tower	1
glimmered	1
the	1
wood	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
man	1
had	1
lain	1
dead.	1
"What	1
became	1
of	1
this	1
Hedwig	1
eventually?"	1
asked	1
the	1
priest	1
at	1
last.	1
"She	1
is	1
married	1
to	1
General	1
Schwartz,"	1
said	1
Flambeau.	1
"No	1
doubt	1
you've	1
heard	1
of	1
his	1
career,	1
which	1
was	1
rather	1
romantic.	1
He	1
had	1
distinguished	1
himself	1
even,	1
before	1
his	1
exploits	1
at	1
Sadowa	1
and	1
Gravelotte;	1
in	1
fact,	1
he	1
rose	1
from	1
the	1
ranks,	1
which	1
is	1
very	1
unusual	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
smallest	1
of	1
the	1
German..."	1
Father	1
Brown	1
sat	1
up	1
suddenly.	1
"Rose	1
from	1
the	1
ranks!"	1
he	1
cried,	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
mouth	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
whistle.	1
"Well,	1
well,	1
what	1
a	1
queer	1
story!	1
What	1
a	1
queer	1
way	1
of	1
killing	1
a	1
man;	1
but	1
I	1
suppose	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
one	1
possible.	1
But	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
hate	1
so	1
patient--"	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
mean?"	1
demanded	1
the	1
other.	1
"In	1
what	1
way	1
did	1
they	1
kill	1
the	1
man?"	1
"They	1
killed	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
sash,"	1
said	1
Brown	1
carefully;	1
and	1
then,	1
as	1
Flambeau	1
protested:	1
"Yes,	1
yes,	1
I	1
know	1
about	1
the	1
bullet.	1
Perhaps	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
say	1
he	1
died	1
of	1
having	1
a	1
sash.	1
I	1
know	1
it	1
doesn't	1
sound	1
like	1
having	1
a	1
disease."	1
"I	1
suppose,"	1
said	1
Flambeau,	1
"that	1
you've	1
got	1
some	1
notion	1
in	1
your	1
head,	1
but	1
it	1
won't	1
easily	1
get	1
the	1
bullet	1
out	1
of	1
his.	1
As	1
I	1
explained	1
before,	1
he	1
might	1
easily	1
have	1
been	1
strangled.	1
But	1
he	1
was	1
shot.	1
By	1
whom?	1
By	1
what?"	1
"He	1
was	1
shot	1
by	1
his	1
own	1
orders,"	1
said	1
the	1
priest.	1
"You	1
mean	1
he	1
committed	1
suicide?"	1
"I	1
didn't	1
say	1
by	1
his	1
own	1
wish,"	1
replied	1
Father	1
Brown.	1
"I	1
said	1
by	1
his	1
own	1
orders."	1
"Well,	1
anyhow,	1
what	1
is	1
your	1
theory?"	1
Father	1
Brown	1
laughed.	1
"I	1
am	1
only	1
on	1
my	1
holiday,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"I	1
haven't	1
got	1
any	1
theories.	1
Only	1
this	1
place	1
reminds	1
me	1
of	1
fairy	1
stories,	1
and,	1
if	1
you	1
like,	1
I'll	1
tell	1
you	1
a	1
story."	1
The	1
little	1
pink	1
clouds,	1
that	1
looked	1
rather	1
like	1
sweet-stuff,	1
had	1
floated	1
up	1
to	1
crown	1
the	1
turrets	1
of	1
the	1
gilt	1
gingerbread	1
castle,	1
and	1
the	1
pink	1
baby	1
fingers	1
of	1
the	1
budding	1
trees	1
seemed	1
spreading	1
and	1
stretching	1
to	1
reach	1
them;	1
the	1
blue	1
sky	1
began	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
bright	1
violet	1
of	1
evening,	1
when	1
Father	1
Brown	1
suddenly	1
spoke	1
again:	1
"It	1
was	1
on	1
a	1
dismal	1
night,	1
with	1
rain	1
still	1
dropping	1
from	1
the	1
trees	1
and	1
dew	1
already	1
clustering,	1
that	1
Prince	1
Otto	1
of	1
Grossenmark	1
stepped	1
hurriedly	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
side	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
castle	1
and	1
walked	1
swiftly	1
into	1
the	1
wood.	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
innumerable	1
sentries	1
saluted	1
him,	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
notice	1
it.	1
He	1
had	1
no	1
wish	1
to	1
be	1
specially	1
noticed	1
himself.	1
He	1
was	1
glad	1
when	1
the	1
great	1
trees,	1
grey	1
and	1
already	1
greasy	1
with	1
rain,	1
swallowed	1
him	1
up	1
like	1
a	1
swamp.	1
He	1
had	1
deliberately	1
chosen	1
the	1
least	1
frequented	1
side	1
of	1
his	1
palace,	1
but	1
even	1
that	1
was	1
more	1
frequented	1
than	1
he	1
liked.	1
But	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
particular	1
chance	1
of	1
officious	1
or	1
diplomatic	1
pursuit,	1
for	1
his	1
exit	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
sudden	1
impulse.	1
All	1
the	1
full-dressed	1
diplomatists	1
he	1
left	1
behind	1
were	1
unimportant.	1
He	1
had	1
realized	1
suddenly	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
do	1
without	1
them.	1
"His	1
great	1
passion	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
much	1
nobler	1
dread	1
of	1
death,	1
but	1
the	1
strange	1
desire	1
of	1
gold.	1
For	1
this	1
legend	1
of	1
the	1
gold	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
Grossenmark	1
and	1
invaded	1
Heiligwaldenstein.	1
For	1
this	1
and	1
only	1
this	1
he	1
had	1
bought	1
the	1
traitor	1
and	1
butchered	1
the	1
hero,	1
for	1
this	1
he	1
had	1
long	1
questioned	1
and	1
cross-questioned	1
the	1
false	1
Chamberlain,	1
until	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
conclusion	1
that,	1
touching	1
his	1
ignorance,	1
the	1
renegade	1
really	1
told	1
the	1
truth.	1
For	1
this	1
he	1
had,	1
somewhat	1
reluctantly,	1
paid	1
and	1
promised	1
money	1
on	1
the	1
chance	1
of	1
gaining	1
the	1
larger	1
amount;	1
and	1
for	1
this	1
he	1
had	1
stolen	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
palace	1
like	1
a	1
thief	1
in	1
the	1
rain,	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
thought	1
of	1
another	1
way	1
to	1
get	1
the	1
desire	1
of	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
to	1
get	1
it	1
cheap.	1
"Away	1
at	1
the	1
upper	1
end	1
of	1
a	1
rambling	1
mountain	1
path	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
making	1
his	1
way,	1
among	1
the	1
pillared	1
rocks	1
along	1
the	1
ridge	1
that	1
hangs	1
above	1
the	1
town,	1
stood	1
the	1
hermitage,	1
hardly	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
cavern	1
fenced	1
with	1
thorn,	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
third	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
brethren	1
had	1
long	1
hidden	1
himself	1
from	1
the	1
world.	1
He,	1
thought	1
Prince	1
Otto,	1
could	1
have	1
no	1
real	1
reason	1
for	1
refusing	1
to	1
give	1
up	1
the	1
gold.	1
He	1
had	1
known	1
its	1
place	1
for	1
years,	1
and	1
made	1
no	1
effort	1
to	1
find	1
it,	1
even	1
before	1
his	1
new	1
ascetic	1
creed	1
had	1
cut	1
him	1
off	1
from	1
property	1
or	1
pleasures.	1
True,	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
an	1
enemy,	1
but	1
he	1
now	1
professed	1
a	1
duty	1
of	1
having	1
no	1
enemies.	1
Some	1
concession	1
to	1
his	1
cause,	1
some	1
appeal	1
to	1
his	1
principles,	1
would	1
probably	1
get	1
the	1
mere	1
money	1
secret	1
out	1
of	1
him.	1
Otto	1
was	1
no	1
coward,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
network	1
of	1
military	1
precautions,	1
and,	1
in	1
any	1
case,	1
his	1
avarice	1
was	1
stronger	1
than	1
his	1
fears.	1
Nor	1
was	1
there	1
much	1
cause	1
for	1
fear.	1
Since	1
he	1
was	1
certain	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
private	1
arms	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
principality,	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
hundred	1
times	1
more	1
certain	1
there	1
were	1
none	1
in	1
the	1
Quaker's	1
little	1
hermitage	1
on	1
the	1
hill,	1
where	1
he	1
lived	1
on	1
herbs,	1
with	1
two	1
old	1
rustic	1
servants,	1
and	1
with	1
no	1
other	1
voice	1
of	1
man	1
for	1
year	1
after	1
year.	1
Prince	1
Otto	1
looked	1
down	1
with	1
something	1
of	1
a	1
grim	1
smile	1
at	1
the	1
bright,	1
square	1
labyrinths	1
of	1
the	1
lamp-lit	1
city	1
below	1
him.	1
For	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
the	1
eye	1
could	1
see	1
there	1
ran	1
the	1
rifles	1
of	1
his	1
friends,	1
and	1
not	1
one	1
pinch	1
of	1
powder	1
for	1
his	1
enemies.	1
Rifles	1
ranked	1
so	1
close	1
even	1
to	1
that	1
mountain	1
path	1
that	1
a	1
cry	1
from	1
him	1
would	1
bring	1
the	1
soldiers	1
rushing	1
up	1
the	1
hill,	1
to	1
say	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
wood	1
and	1
ridge	1
were	1
patrolled	1
at	1
regular	1
intervals;	1
rifles	1
so	1
far	1
away,	1
in	1
the	1
dim	1
woods,	1
dwarfed	1
by	1
distance,	1
beyond	1
the	1
river,	1
that	1
an	1
enemy	1
could	1
not	1
slink	1
into	1
the	1
town	1
by	1
any	1
detour.	1
And	1
round	1
the	1
palace	1
rifles	1
at	1
the	1
west	1
door	1
and	1
the	1
east	1
door,	1
at	1
the	1
north	1
door	1
and	1
the	1
south,	1
and	1
all	1
along	1
the	1
four	1
facades	1
linking	1
them.	1
He	1
was	1
safe.	1
"It	1
was	1
all	1
the	1
more	1
clear	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
crested	1
the	1
ridge	1
and	1
found	1
how	1
naked	1
was	1
the	1
nest	1
of	1
his	1
old	1
enemy.	1
He	1
found	1
himself	1
on	1
a	1
small	1
platform	1
of	1
rock,	1
broken	1
abruptly	1
by	1
the	1
three	1
corners	1
of	1
precipice.	1
Behind	1
was	1
the	1
black	1
cave,	1
masked	1
with	1
green	1
thorn,	1
so	1
low	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
hard	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
could	1
enter	1
it.	1
In	1
front	1
was	1
the	1
fall	1
of	1
the	1
cliffs	1
and	1
the	1
vast	1
but	1
cloudy	1
vision	1
of	1
the	1
valley.	1
On	1
the	1
small	1
rock	1
platform	1
stood	1
an	1
old	1
bronze	1
lectern	1
or	1
reading-stand,	1
groaning	1
under	1
a	1
great	1
German	1
Bible.	1
The	1
bronze	1
or	1
copper	1
of	1
it	1
had	1
grown	1
green	1
with	1
the	1
eating	1
airs	1
of	1
that	1
exalted	1
place,	1
and	1
Otto	1
had	1
instantly	1
the	1
thought,	1
"Even	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
arms,	1
they	1
must	1
be	1
rusted	1
by	1
now."	1
Moonrise	1
had	1
already	1
made	1
a	1
deathly	1
dawn	1
behind	1
the	1
crests	1
and	1
crags,	1
and	1
the	1
rain	1
had	1
ceased.	1
"Behind	1
the	1
lectern,	1
and	1
looking	1
across	1
the	1
valley,	1
stood	1
a	1
very	1
old	1
man	1
in	1
a	1
black	1
robe	1
that	1
fell	1
as	1
straight	1
as	1
the	1
cliffs	1
around	1
him,	1
but	1
whose	1
white	1
hair	1
and	1
weak	1
voice	1
seemed	1
alike	1
to	1
waver	1
in	1
the	1
wind.	1
He	1
was	1
evidently	1
reading	1
some	1
daily	1
lesson	1
as	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
religious	1
exercises.	1
"They	1
trust	1
in	1
their	1
horses..."	1
"`Sir,'	1
said	1
the	1
Prince	1
of	1
Heiligwaldenstein,	1
with	1
quite	1
unusual	1
courtesy,	1
`I	1
should	1
like	1
only	1
one	1
word	1
with	1
you.'	1
"`...and	1
in	1
their	1
chariots,'	1
went	1
on	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
weakly,	1
`but	1
we	1
will	1
trust	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
Hosts....'	1
His	1
last	1
words	1
were	1
inaudible,	1
but	1
he	1
closed	1
the	1
book	1
reverently	1
and,	1
being	1
nearly	1
blind,	1
made	1
a	1
groping	1
movement	1
and	1
gripped	1
the	1
reading-stand.	1
Instantly	1
his	1
two	1
servants	1
slipped	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
low-browed	1
cavern	1
and	1
supported	1
him.	1
They	1
wore	1
dull-black	1
gowns	1
like	1
his	1
own,	1
but	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
frosty	1
silver	1
on	1
the	1
hair,	1
nor	1
the	1
frost-bitten	1
refinement	1
of	1
the	1
features.	1
They	1
were	1
peasants,	1
Croat	1
or	1
Magyar,	1
with	1
broad,	1
blunt	1
visages	1
and	1
blinking	1
eyes.	1
For	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
something	1
troubled	1
the	1
Prince,	1
but	1
his	1
courage	1
and	1
diplomatic	1
sense	1
stood	1
firm.	1
"`I	1
fear	1
we	1
have	1
not	1
met,'	1
he	1
said,	1
`since	1
that	1
awful	1
cannonade	1
in	1
which	1
your	1
poor	1
brother	1
died.'	1
"`All	1
my	1
brothers	1
died,'	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
man,	1
still	1
looking	1
across	1
the	1
valley.	1
Then,	1
for	1
one	1
instant	1
turning	1
on	1
Otto	1
his	1
drooping,	1
delicate	1
features,	1
and	1
the	1
wintry	1
hair	1
that	1
seemed	1
to	1
drip	1
over	1
his	1
eyebrows	1
like	1
icicles,	1
he	1
added:	1
`You	1
see,	1
I	1
am	1
dead,	1
too.'	1
"`I	1
hope	1
you'll	1
understand,'	1
said	1
the	1
Prince,	1
controlling	1
himself	1
almost	1
to	1
a	1
point	1
of	1
conciliation,	1
`that	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
come	1
here	1
to	1
haunt	1
you,	1
as	1
a	1
mere	1
ghost	1
of	1
those	1
great	1
quarrels.	1
We	1
will	1
not	1
talk	1
about	1
who	1
was	1
right	1
or	1
wrong	1
in	1
that,	1
but	1
at	1
least	1
there	1
was	1
one	1
point	1
on	1
which	1
we	1
were	1
never	1
wrong,	1
because	1
you	1
were	1
always	1
right.	1
Whatever	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
said	1
of	1
the	1
policy	1
of	1
your	1
family,	1
no	1
one	1
for	1
one	1
moment	1
imagines	1
that	1
you	1
were	1
moved	1
by	1
the	1
mere	1
gold;	1
you	1
have	1
proved	1
yourself	1
above	1
the	1
suspicion	1
that...'	1
"The	1
old	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
black	1
gown	1
had	1
hitherto	1
continued	1
to	1
gaze	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
watery	1
blue	1
eyes	1
and	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
weak	1
wisdom	1
in	1
his	1
face.	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
word	1
`gold'	1
was	1
said	1
he	1
held	1
out	1
his	1
hand	1
as	1
if	1
in	1
arrest	1
of	1
something,	1
and	1
turned	1
away	1
his	1
face	1
to	1
the	1
mountains.	1
"`He	1
has	1
spoken	1
of	1
gold,'	1
he	1
said.	1
`He	1
has	1
spoken	1
of	1
things	1
not	1
lawful.	1
Let	1
him	1
cease	1
to	1
speak.'	1
"Otto	1
had	1
the	1
vice	1
of	1
his	1
Prussian	1
type	1
and	1
tradition,	1
which	1
is	1
to	1
regard	1
success	1
not	1
as	1
an	1
incident	1
but	1
as	1
a	1
quality.	1
He	1
conceived	1
himself	1
and	1
his	1
like	1
as	1
perpetually	1
conquering	1
peoples	1
who	1
were	1
perpetually	1
being	1
conquered.	1
Consequently,	1
he	1
was	1
ill	1
acquainted	1
with	1
the	1
emotion	1
of	1
surprise,	1
and	1
ill	1
prepared	1
for	1
the	1
next	1
movement,	1
which	1
startled	1
and	1
stiffened	1
him.	1
He	1
had	1
opened	1
his	1
mouth	1
to	1
answer	1
the	1
hermit,	1
when	1
the	1
mouth	1
was	1
stopped	1
and	1
the	1
voice	1
strangled	1
by	1
a	1
strong,	1
soft	1
gag	1
suddenly	1
twisted	1
round	1
his	1
head	1
like	1
a	1
tourniquet.	1
It	1
was	1
fully	1
forty	1
seconds	1
before	1
he	1
even	1
realized	1
that	1
the	1
two	1
Hungarian	1
servants	1
had	1
done	1
it,	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
done	1
it	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
military	1
scarf.	1
"The	1
old	1
man	1
went	1
again	1
weakly	1
to	1
his	1
great	1
brazen-supported	1
Bible,	1
turned	1
over	1
the	1
leaves,	1
with	1
a	1
patience	1
that	1
had	1
something	1
horrible	1
about	1
it,	1
till	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
Epistle	1
of	1
St	1
James,	1
and	1
then	1
began	1
to	1
read:	1
`The	1
tongue	1
is	1
a	1
little	1
member,	1
but--'	1
"Something	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
voice	1
made	1
the	1
Prince	1
turn	1
suddenly	1
and	1
plunge	1
down	1
the	1
mountain-path	1
he	1
had	1
climbed.	1
He	1
was	1
half-way	1
towards	1
the	1
gardens	1
of	1
the	1
palace	1
before	1
he	1
even	1
tried	1
to	1
tear	1
the	1
strangling	1
scarf	1
from	1
his	1
neck	1
and	1
jaws.	1
He	1
tried	1
again	1
and	1
again,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
impossible;	1
the	1
men	1
who	1
had	1
knotted	1
that	1
gag	1
knew	1
the	1
difference	1
between	1
what	1
a	1
man	1
can	1
do	1
with	1
his	1
hands	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
what	1
he	1
can	1
do	1
with	1
his	1
hands	1
behind	1
his	1
head.	1
His	1
legs	1
were	1
free	1
to	1
leap	1
like	1
an	1
antelope	1
on	1
the	1
mountains,	1
his	1
arms	1
were	1
free	1
to	1
use	1
any	1
gesture	1
or	1
wave	1
any	1
signal,	1
but	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
speak.	1
A	1
dumb	1
devil	1
was	1
in	1
him.	1
"He	1
had	1
come	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
woods	1
that	1
walled	1
in	1
the	1
castle	1
before	1
he	1
had	1
quite	1
realized	1
what	1
his	1
wordless	1
state	1
meant	1
and	1
was	1
meant	1
to	1
mean.	1
Once	1
more	1
he	1
looked	1
down	1
grimly	1
at	1
the	1
bright,	1
square	1
labyrinths	1
of	1
the	1
lamp-lit	1
city	1
below	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
smiled	1
no	1
more.	1
He	1
felt	1
himself	1
repeating	1
the	1
phrases	1
of	1
his	1
former	1
mood	1
with	1
a	1
murderous	1
irony.	1
Far	1
as	1
the	1
eye	1
could	1
see	1
ran	1
the	1
rifles	1
of	1
his	1
friends,	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
whom	1
would	1
shoot	1
him	1
dead	1
if	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
answer	1
the	1
challenge.	1
Rifles	1
were	1
so	1
near	1
that	1
the	1
wood	1
and	1
ridge	1
could	1
be	1
patrolled	1
at	1
regular	1
intervals;	1
therefore	1
it	1
was	1
useless	1
to	1
hide	1
in	1
the	1
wood	1
till	1
morning.	1
Rifles	1
were	1
ranked	1
so	1
far	1
away	1
that	1
an	1
enemy	1
could	1
not	1
slink	1
into	1
the	1
town	1
by	1
any	1
detour;	1
therefore	1
it	1
was	1
vain	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
city	1
by	1
any	1
remote	1
course.	1
A	1
cry	1
from	1
him	1
would	1
bring	1
his	1
soldiers	1
rushing	1
up	1
the	1
hill.	1
But	1
from	1
him	1
no	1
cry	1
would	1
come.	1
"The	1
moon	1
had	1
risen	1
in	1
strengthening	1
silver,	1
and	1
the	1
sky	1
showed	1
in	1
stripes	1
of	1
bright,	1
nocturnal	1
blue	1
between	1
the	1
black	1
stripes	1
of	1
the	1
pines	1
about	1
the	1
castle.	1
Flowers	1
of	1
some	1
wide	1
and	1
feathery	1
sort--	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
noticed	1
such	1
things	1
before--were	1
at	1
once	1
luminous	1
and	1
discoloured	1
by	1
the	1
moonshine,	1
and	1
seemed	1
indescribably	1
fantastic	1
as	1
they	1
clustered,	1
as	1
if	1
crawling	1
about	1
the	1
roots	1
of	1
the	1
trees.	1
Perhaps	1
his	1
reason	1
had	1
been	1
suddenly	1
unseated	1
by	1
the	1
unnatural	1
captivity	1
he	1
carried	1
with	1
him,	1
but	1
in	1
that	1
wood	1
he	1
felt	1
something	1
unfathomably	1
German--the	1
fairy	1
tale.	1
He	1
knew	1
with	1
half	1
his	1
mind	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
drawing	1
near	1
to	1
the	1
castle	1
of	1
an	1
ogre--he	1
had	1
forgotten	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
ogre.	1
He	1
remembered	1
asking	1
his	1
mother	1
if	1
bears	1
lived	1
in	1
the	1
old	1
park	1
at	1
home.	1
He	1
stooped	1
to	1
pick	1
a	1
flower,	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
charm	1
against	1
enchantment.	1
The	1
stalk	1
was	1
stronger	1
than	1
he	1
expected,	1
and	1
broke	1
with	1
a	1
slight	1
snap.	1
Carefully	1
trying	1
to	1
place	1
it	1
in	1
his	1
scarf,	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
halloo,	1
`Who	1
goes	1
there?'	1
Then	1
he	1
remembered	1
the	1
scarf	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
its	1
usual	1
place.	1
"He	1
tried	1
to	1
scream	1
and	1
was	1
silent.	1
The	1
second	1
challenge	1
came;	1
and	1
then	1
a	1
shot	1
that	1
shrieked	1
as	1
it	1
came	1
and	1
then	1
was	1
stilled	1
suddenly	1
by	1
impact.	1
Otto	1
of	1
Grossenmark	1
lay	1
very	1
peacefully	1
among	1
the	1
fairy	1
trees,	1
and	1
would	1
do	1
no	1
more	1
harm	1
either	1
with	1
gold	1
or	1
steel;	1
only	1
the	1
silver	1
pencil	1
of	1
the	1
moon	1
would	1
pick	1
out	1
and	1
trace	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
the	1
intricate	1
ornament	1
of	1
his	1
uniform,	1
or	1
the	1
old	1
wrinkles	1
on	1
his	1
brow.	1
May	1
God	1
have	1
mercy	1
on	1
his	1
soul.	1
"The	1
sentry	1
who	1
had	1
fired,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
strict	1
orders	1
of	1
the	1
garrison,	1
naturally	1
ran	1
forward	1
to	1
find	1
some	1
trace	1
of	1
his	1
quarry.	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
private	1
named	1
Schwartz,	1
since	1
not	1
unknown	1
in	1
his	1
profession,	1
and	1
what	1
he	1
found	1
was	1
a	1
bald	1
man	1
in	1
uniform,	1
but	1
with	1
his	1
face	1
so	1
bandaged	1
by	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
mask	1
made	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
military	1
scarf	1
that	1
nothing	1
but	1
open,	1
dead	1
eyes	1
could	1
be	1
seen,	1
glittering	1
stonily	1
in	1
the	1
moonlight.	1
The	1
bullet	1
had	1
gone	1
through	1
the	1
gag	1
into	1
the	1
jaw;	1
that	1
is	1
why	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
shot-hole	1
in	1
the	1
scarf,	1
but	1
only	1
one	1
shot.	1
Naturally,	1
if	1
not	1
correctly,	1
young	1
Schwartz	1
tore	1
off	1
the	1
mysterious	1
silken	1
mask	1
and	1
cast	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
grass;	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
saw	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
slain.	1
"We	1
cannot	1
be	1
certain	1
of	1
the	1
next	1
phase.	1
But	1
I	1
incline	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
fairy	1
tale,	1
after	1
all,	1
in	1
that	1
little	1
wood,	1
horrible	1
as	1
was	1
its	1
occasion.	1
Whether	1
the	1
young	1
lady	1
named	1
Hedwig	1
had	1
any	1
previous	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
soldier	1
she	1
saved	1
and	1
eventually	1
married,	1
or	1
whether	1
she	1
came	1
accidentally	1
upon	1
the	1
accident	1
and	1
their	1
intimacy	1
began	1
that	1
night,	1
we	1
shall	1
probably	1
never	1
know.	1
But	1
we	1
can	1
know,	1
I	1
fancy,	1
that	1
this	1
Hedwig	1
was	1
a	1
heroine,	1
and	1
deserved	1
to	1
marry	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
became	1
something	1
of	1
a	1
hero.	1
She	1
did	1
the	1
bold	1
and	1
the	1
wise	1
thing.	1
She	1
persuaded	1
the	1
sentry	1
to	1
go	1
back	1
to	1
his	1
post,	1
in	1
which	1
place	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
to	1
connect	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
disaster;	1
he	1
was	1
but	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
loyal	1
and	1
orderly	1
of	1
fifty	1
such	1
sentries	1
within	1
call.	1
She	1
remained	1
by	1
the	1
body	1
and	1
gave	1
the	1
alarm;	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
to	1
connect	1
her	1
with	1
the	1
disaster	1
either,	1
since	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
got,	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
have,	1
any	1
firearms.	1
"Well,"	1
said	1
Father	1
Brown	1
rising	1
cheerfully	1
"I	1
hope	1
they're	1
happy."	1
"Where	1
are	1
you	1
going?"	1
asked	1
his	1
friend.	1
"I'm	1
going	1
to	1
have	1
another	1
look	1
at	1
that	1
portrait	1
of	1
the	1
Chamberlain,	1
the	1
Arnhold	1
who	1
betrayed	1
his	1
brethren,"	1
answered	1
the	1
priest.	1
"I	1
wonder	1
what	1
part--I	1
wonder	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
is	1
less	1
a	1
traitor	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
twice	1
a	1
traitor?"	1
And	1
he	1
ruminated	1
long	1
before	1
the	1
portrait	1
of	1
a	1
white-haired	1
man	1
with	1
black	1
eyebrows	1
and	1
a	1
pink,	1
painted	1
sort	1
of	1
smile	1
that	1
seemed	1
to	1
contradict	1
the	1
black	1
warning	1
in	1
his	1
eyes.	1
