But	1

As	1

Of	1

I	1
thanke	1
you	1
Gentlemen:	1
This	1
supernaturall	1
solliciting	1
Cannot	1

If	1

why	1

giuen	1

earnest	1
of	1

Commencing	1
in	1
a	1
Truth?	1
I	1
am	1
Thane	1

If	1
good?	1
why	1
doe	1
I	1
yeeld	1
to	1
that	1
suggestion,	1
Whose	1
horrid	1
Image	1
doth	1
vnfixe	1
my	1
Heire,	1
And	1
make	1
my	1

Heart	1
knock	1

Ribbes,	1
Against	1
the	1

of	1

Present	1
Feares	1
Are	1
lesse	1

horrible	1
Imaginings:	1
My	1
Thought,	1
whose	1
Murther	1

That	1

Whiles	1

with	1

King	1
that	1

This	1
haue	1
I	1
thought	1
good	1
to	1
deliuer	1
thee	1
(my	1
dearest	1
Partner	1
of	1
Greatnesse)	1
that	1
thou	1
might'st	1
not	1
loose	1
the	1
dues	1
of	1
reioycing	1
by	1
being	1
ignorant	1
of	1

I	1
feare	1
thy	1
Nature,	1
It	1
is	1
too	1
full	1
o'th'	1
Milke	1
of	1
humane	1
kindnesse,	1
To	1
catch	1
the	1
neerest	1
way.	1
Thou	1
would'st	1
be	1
great,	1
Art	1
not	1
without	1
Ambition,	1
but	1
without	1
The	1
illnesse	1
should	1
attend	1
it.	1
What	1
thou	1
would'st	1
highly,	1
That	1
would'st	1
thou	1
holily:	1
would'st	1
not	1
play	1
false,	1
And	1
yet	1
would'st	1
wrongly	1
winne.	1
Thould'st	1
haue,	1
great	1
Glamys,	1
that	1
which	1
cryes,	1
Thus	1
thou	1
must	1
doe,	1
if	1
thou	1
haue	1
it;	1
And	1
that	1
which	1
rather	1
thou	1
do'st	1
feare	1
to	1
doe,	1
Then	1
wishest	1
should	1
be	1
vndone.	1
High	1

And	1

What	1
Beast	1
was't	1
then	1
That	1

When	1
you	1

then	1
you	1
were	1
a	1

And	1
to	1
be	1

then	1
what	1

you	1

Be	1
so	1

Nor	1

Did	1

Yet	1

To	1

A	1

Proceeding	1

Which	1

There's	1

This	1

A	1
foolish	1
thought,	1
to	1

a	1
sorry	1

Macb.	1
There's	1
one	1
did	1

Murther,	1
that	1
they	1

But	1

I	1
could	1
not	1

When	1

Consider	1

But	1
wherefore	1
could	1

I	1
pronounce	1
Amen?	1
I	1
had	1

of	1
Blessing,	1
and	1
Amen	1
stuck	1

These	1

Still	1

And	1
Drinke,	1
Sir,	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
prouoker	1

Macd.	1
What	1

Marry,	1

Nose-painting,	1

Lecherie,	1

it	1
prouokes,	1
and	1
vnprouokes:	1
it	1
prouokes	1
the	1
desire,	1
but	1
it	1
takes	1
away	1
the	1
performance.	1
Therefore	1
much	1
Drinke	1
may	1
be	1
said	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
Equiuocator	1
with	1
Lecherie:	1
it	1
makes	1
him,	1

it	1
marres	1
him;	1
it	1
sets	1
him	1
on,	1
and	1
it	1
takes	1
him	1
off;	1
it	1
perswades	1
him,	1
and	1
dis-heartens	1
him;	1
makes	1
him	1
stand	1
too,	1
and	1
not	1
stand	1
too:	1
in	1
conclusion,	1
equiuocates	1
him	1

There's	1

All	1

Renowne	1

The	1

Those	1

Their	1

So	1
were	1
their	1
Daggers,	1

Wherefore	1

His	1
Golden	1
Blood,	1
And	1

Was	1

together?	1
Murth.	1
It	1
was,	1
so	1
please	1
your	1
Highnesse	1
Macb.	1
Well	1
then,	1
Now	1
haue	1
you	1
consider'd	1
of	1
my	1
speeches:	1
Know,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
he,	1
in	1
the	1
times	1
past,	1
Which	1
held	1
you	1
so	1
vnder	1
fortune,	1
Which	1
you	1
thought	1
had	1
been	1
our	1
innocent	1
selfe.	1
This	1
I	1
made	1
good	1
to	1
you,	1
in	1
our	1
last	1
conference,	1
Past	1
in	1
probation	1
with	1
you:	1
How	1
you	1
were	1
borne	1
in	1
hand,	1
how	1
crost:	1
The	1
Instruments:	1
who	1
wrought	1
with	1
them:	1
And	1
all	1
things	1
else,	1
that	1
might	1
To	1
halfe	1
a	1
Soule,	1
and	1
to	1
a	1
Notion	1
craz'd,	1
Say,	1
Thus	1
did	1
Banquo	1
1.Murth.	1
You	1
made	1
it	1
knowne	1
to	1
vs	1
Macb.	1
I	1
did	1
so:	1
And	1
went	1
further,	1
which	1
is	1
now	1
Our	1
point	1
of	1
second	1
meeting.	1
Doe	1
you	1
finde	1
your	1
patience	1
so	1
predominant,	1
In	1
your	1
nature,	1
that	1
you	1
can	1
let	1
this	1
goe?	1
Are	1
you	1
so	1
Gospell'd,	1
to	1
pray	1
for	1
this	1
good	1

And	1
for	1
his	1
Issue,	1
whose	1

Hath	1
bow'd	1
you	1
to	1

Graue,	1
and	1
begger'd	1
Yours	1

Distinguishes	1

The	1

According	1

Not	1

So	1

So	1

That	1

Against	1

With	1

And	1

For	1

Too	1

Auant,	1

Thy	1

What	1

Thoughts	1
Which	1
can	1
interpret	1
farther:	1
Onely	1
I	1
say	1
Things	1
haue	1
bin	1
strangely	1
borne.	1
The	1
gracious	1
Duncan	1
Was	1
pittied	1
of	1
Macbeth:	1
marry	1
he	1
was	1
dead:	1
And	1
the	1
right	1
valiant	1
Banquo	1
walk'd	1
too	1
late,	1
Whom	1
you	1
may	1
say	1
(if't	1
please	1
you)	1
Fleans	1
kill'd,	1
For	1
Fleans	1
fled:	1
Men	1
must	1
not	1
walke	1
too	1
late.	1
Who	1
cannot	1
want	1
the	1
thought,	1
how	1
monstrous	1
It	1
was	1
for	1
Malcolme,	1
and	1
for	1
Donalbane	1
To	1
kill	1
their	1
gracious	1
Father?	1
Damned	1
Fact,	1
How	1
it	1
did	1
greeue	1
Macbeth?	1
Did	1
he	1
not	1
straight	1
In	1
pious	1
rage,	1
the	1
two	1
delinquents	1
teare,	1
That	1
were	1
the	1
Slaues	1
of	1
drinke,	1
and	1
thralles	1
of	1

Was	1
not	1
that	1
Nobly	1

I	1

But	1
cruell	1

when	1
we	1

And	1

From	1

Though	1

Bloody,	1
Luxurious,	1
Auaricious,	1
False,	1
Deceitfull,	1
Sodaine,	1
Malicious,	1
smacking	1
of	1

But	1
there's	1

Your	1

All	1

Boundlesse	1

And	1

But	1

A	1

Destroying	1

All	1

Stands	1

Rosse.	1
Alas	1
poore	1
Countrey,	1
Almost	1
affraid	1
to	1
know	1
it	1

It	1
cannot	1
Be	1
call'd	1
our	1
Mother,	1

our	1
Graue;	1
where	1
nothing	1
But	1
who	1
knowes	1
nothing,	1
is	1
once	1
seene	1
to	1
smile:	1
Where	1
sighes,	1
and	1
groanes,	1
and	1
shrieks	1
that	1
rent	1
the	1

Are	1
made,	1
not	1
mark'd:	1
Where	1
violent	1

seemes	1
A	1
Moderne	1

The	1
Deadmans	1

Is	1
there	1

Macd.	1
Oh	1
Relation;	1
too	1
nice,	1
and	1
yet	1
too	1
true	1
Malc.	1
What's	1
the	1
newest	1
griefe?	1
Rosse.	1
That	1
of	1
an	1
houres	1
age,	1
doth	1
hisse	1
the	1
speaker,	1
Each	1

teemes	1
a	1

one	1
Macd.	1
How	1
do's	1
my	1

Rosse.	1
Why	1

Macd.	1
And	1
all	1
my	1
Children?	1
Rosse.	1
Well	1
too	1
Macd.	1
The	1
Tyrant	1
ha's	1
not	1
batter'd	1
at	1
their	1

Rosse.	1
No,	1
they	1
were	1
wel	1
at	1
peace,	1
when	1
I	1
did	1
leaue	1
'em	1
Macd.	1
Be	1
not	1
a	1
niggard	1
of	1
your	1
speech:	1
How	1
gos't?	1
Rosse.	1
When	1
I	1
came	1
hither	1
to	1
transport	1
the	1
Tydings	1
Which	1
I	1
haue	1
heauily	1
borne,	1
there	1
ran	1
a	1
Rumour	1
Of	1
many	1
worthy	1
Fellowes,	1
that	1
were	1
out,	1
Which	1
was	1
to	1
my	1
beleefe	1
witnest	1
the	1
rather,	1
For	1
that	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
Tyrants	1
Power	1
a-foot.	1
Now	1
is	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
helpe:	1
your	1
eye	1
in	1
Scotland	1
Would	1
create	1
Soldiours,	1
make	1
our	1
women	1
fight,	1
To	1
doffe	1
their	1
dire	1
distresses	1
Malc.	1
Bee't	1
their	1
comfort	1
We	1
are	1
comming	1
thither:	1
Gracious	1
England	1
hath	1
Lent	1
vs	1
good	1
Seyward,	1
and	1
ten	1
thousand	1
men,	1
An	1
older,	1
and	1
a	1
better	1
Souldier,	1
none	1
That	1
Christendome	1
giues	1
out	1
Rosse.	1
Would	1
I	1
could	1
answer	1
This	1
comfort	1
with	1
the	1
like.	1
But	1
I	1
haue	1
words	1
That	1
would	1
be	1
howl'd	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
desert	1
ayre,	1
Where	1
hearing	1
should	1
not	1
latch	1
them	1
Macd.	1
What	1
concerne	1
they,	1
The	1
generall	1
cause,	1
or	1
is	1
it	1
a	1
Fee-griefe	1
Due	1
to	1
some	1
single	1
brest?	1
Rosse.	1
No	1
minde	1
that's	1
honest	1
But	1
in	1
it	1
shares	1
some	1
woe,	1
though	1
the	1
maine	1
part	1
Pertaines	1
to	1
you	1
alone	1
Macd.	1
If	1
it	1
be	1
mine	1
Keepe	1
it	1
not	1
from	1
me,	1
quickly	1
let	1
me	1
haue	1
it	1
Rosse.	1
Let	1
not	1
your	1
eares	1
dispise	1
my	1
tongue	1
for	1
euer,	1
Which	1
shall	1
possesse	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
heauiest	1
sound	1
that	1
euer	1
yet	1
they	1
heard	1
Macd.	1
Humh:	1
I	1
guesse	1
at	1
it	1
Rosse.	1
Your	1
Castle	1
is	1
surpriz'd:	1
your	1
Wife,	1
and	1
Babes	1
Sauagely	1
slaughter'd:	1
To	1
relate	1
the	1
manner	1
Were	1
on	1
the	1
Quarry	1
of	1
these	1
murther'd	1
Deere	1
To	1
adde	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
you	1
Malc.	1
Mercifull	1
Heauen:	1
What	1
man,	1
ne're	1
pull	1
your	1
hat	1
vpon	1
your	1
browes:	1
Giue	1
sorrow	1
words;	1
the	1
griefe	1
that	1
do's	1
not	1
speake,	1
Whispers	1
the	1
o're-fraught	1
heart,	1
and	1
bids	1
it	1
breake	1
Macd.	1
My	1
Children	1
too?	1
Ro.	1
Wife,	1
Children,	1
Seruants,	1
all	1
that	1
could	1
be	1
found	1
Macd.	1
And	1
I	1
must	1
be	1
from	1
thence?	1
My	1
wife	1
kil'd	1
too?	1
Rosse.	1
I	1
haue	1
said	1
Malc.	1
Be	1
comforted.	1
Let's	1
make	1
vs	1
Med'cines	1
of	1
our	1
great	1
Reuenge,	1
To	1
cure	1
this	1
deadly	1
greefe	1
Macd.	1
He	1
ha's	1
no	1
Children.	1
All	1
my	1
pretty	1
ones?	1
Did	1
you	1
say	1
All?	1
Oh	1
Hell-Kite!	1
All?	1
What,	1
All	1
my	1
pretty	1
Chickens,	1
and	1
their	1
Damme	1
At	1
one	1
fell	1
swoope?	1
Malc.	1
Dispute	1
it	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
Macd.	1
I	1
shall	1
do	1
so:	1
But	1
I	1
must	1
also	1
feele	1
it	1
as	1
a	1
man;	1
I	1
cannot	1
but	1
remember	1
such	1
things	1
were	1
That	1
were	1
most	1
precious	1
to	1
me:	1
Did	1
heauen	1
looke	1
on,	1
And	1
would	1
not	1
take	1
their	1
part?	1
Sinfull	1
Macduff,	1
They	1
were	1
all	1
strooke	1
for	1
thee:	1
Naught	1
that	1
I	1
am,	1
Not	1
for	1
their	1
owne	1
demerits,	1
but	1
for	1
mine	1
Fell	1
slaughter	1
on	1
their	1
soules:	1
Heauen	1
rest	1
them	1
now	1
Mal.	1
Be	1
this	1
the	1
Whetstone	1
of	1
your	1
sword,	1
let	1
griefe	1
Conuert	1
to	1
anger:	1
blunt	1
not	1
the	1
heart,	1
enrage	1
it	1
Macd.	1
O	1
I	1
could	1
play	1
the	1
woman	1
with	1
mine	1
eyes,	1
And	1
Braggart	1
with	1
my	1
tongue.	1
But	1
gentle	1
Heauens,	1
Cut	1

Front	1

Front,	1
Bring	1

this	1
Fiend	1
of	1
Scotland,	1
and	1

Within	1

Heauen	1

Mal.	1
This	1
time	1
goes	1
manly:	1
Come	1
go	1
we	1
to	1
the	1
King,	1
our	1
Power	1
is	1
ready,	1
Our	1
lacke	1
is	1

Put	1

Receiue	1

The	1

Enter	1

Nights	1
watch'd	1
with	1

perceiue	1
no	1

When	1

Gent.	1
Since	1

Seale	1

Doct.	1
A	1
great	1

Nature,	1
to	1
receyue	1
at	1

the	1
benefit	1
of	1

In	1

Gent.	1
That	1

You	1

Neither	1

Enter	1

Lo	1

How	1

Gent.	1
Why	1
