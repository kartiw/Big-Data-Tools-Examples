A	1
DISCUSSION	1
SOMEWHAT	1
IN	1
THE	1
AIR	1
The	1
flying	1
ship	1
of	1
Professor	1
Lucifer	1
sang	1
through	1
the	1
skies	1
like	1
a	1
silver	1
arrow;	1
the	1
bleak	1
white	1
steel	1
of	1
it,	1
gleaming	1
in	1
the	1
bleak	1
blue	1
emptiness	1
of	1
the	1
evening.	1
That	1
it	1
was	1
far	1
above	1
the	1
earth	1
was	1
no	1
expression	1
for	1
it;	1
to	1
the	1
two	1
men	1
in	1
it,	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
far	1
above	1
the	1
stars.	1
The	1
professor	1
had	1
himself	1
invented	1
the	1
flying	1
machine,	1
and	1
had	1
also	1
invented	1
nearly	1
everything	1
in	1
it.	1
Every	1
sort	1
of	1
tool	1
or	1
apparatus	1
had,	1
in	1
consequence,	1
to	1
the	1
full,	1
that	1
fantastic	1
and	1
distorted	1
look	1
which	1
belongs	1
to	1
the	1
miracles	1
of	1
science.	1
For	1
the	1
world	1
of	1
science	1
and	1
evolution	1
is	1
far	1
more	1
nameless	1
and	1
elusive	1
and	1
like	1
a	1
dream	1
than	1
the	1
world	1
of	1
poetry	1
and	1
religion;	1
since	1
in	1
the	1
latter	1
images	1
and	1
ideas	1
remain	1
themselves	1
eternally,	1
while	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
whole	1
idea	1
of	1
evolution	1
that	1
identities	1
melt	1
into	1
each	1
other	1
as	1
they	1
do	1
in	1
a	1
nightmare.	1
All	1
the	1
tools	1
of	1
Professor	1
Lucifer	1
were	1
the	1
ancient	1
human	1
tools	1
gone	1
mad,	1
grown	1
into	1
unrecognizable	1
shapes,	1
forgetful	1
of	1
their	1
origin,	1
forgetful	1
of	1
their	1
names.	1
That	1
thing	1
which	1
looked	1
like	1
an	1
enormous	1
key	1
with	1
three	1
wheels	1
was	1
really	1
a	1
patent	1
and	1
very	1
deadly	1
revolver.	1
That	1
object	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
created	1
by	1
the	1
entanglement	1
of	1
two	1
corkscrews	1
was	1
really	1
the	1
key.	1
The	1
thing	1
which	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
mistaken	1
for	1
a	1
tricycle	1
turned	1
upside-down	1
was	1
the	1
inexpressibly	1
important	1
instrument	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
corkscrew	1
was	1
the	1
key.	1
All	1
these	1
things,	1
as	1
I	1
say,	1
the	1
professor	1
had	1
invented;	1
he	1
had	1
invented	1
everything	1
in	1
the	1
flying	1
ship,	1
with	1
the	1
exception,	1
perhaps,	1
of	1
himself.	1
This	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
born	1
too	1
late	1
actually	1
to	1
inaugurate,	1
but	1
he	1
believed	1
at	1
least,	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
considerably	1
improved	1
it.	1
There	1
was,	1
however,	1
another	1
man	1
on	1
board,	1
so	1
to	1
speak,	1
at	1
the	1
time.	1
Him,	1
also,	1
by	1
a	1
curious	1
coincidence,	1
the	1
professor	1
had	1
not	1
invented,	1
and	1
him	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
even	1
very	1
greatly	1
improved,	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
fished	1
him	1
up	1
with	1
a	1
lasso	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
back	1
garden,	1
in	1
Western	1
Bulgaria,	1
with	1
the	1
pure	1
object	1
of	1
improving	1
him.	1
He	1
was	1
an	1
exceedingly	1
holy	1
man,	1
almost	1
entirely	1
covered	1
with	1
white	1
hair.	1
You	1
could	1
see	1
nothing	1
but	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
talk	1
with	1
them.	1
A	1
monk	1
of	1
immense	1
learning	1
and	1
acute	1
intellect	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
himself	1
happy	1
in	1
a	1
little	1
stone	1
hut	1
and	1
a	1
little	1
stony	1
garden	1
in	1
the	1
Balkans,	1
chiefly	1
by	1
writing	1
the	1
most	1
crushing	1
refutations	1
of	1
exposures	1
of	1
certain	1
heresies,	1
the	1
last	1
professors	1
of	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
burnt	1
(generally	1
by	1
each	1
other)	1
precisely	1
1,119	1
years	1
previously.	1
They	1
were	1
really	1
very	1
plausible	1
and	1
thoughtful	1
heresies,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
really	1
a	1
creditable	1
or	1
even	1
glorious	1
circumstance,	1
that	1
the	1
old	1
monk	1
had	1
been	1
intellectual	1
enough	1
to	1
detect	1
their	1
fallacy;	1
the	1
only	1
misfortune	1
was	1
that	1
nobody	1
in	1
the	1
modern	1
world	1
was	1
intellectual	1
enough	1
even	1
to	1
understand	1
their	1
argument.	1
The	1
old	1
monk,	1
one	1
of	1
whose	1
names	1
was	1
Michael,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
a	1
name	1
quite	1
impossible	1
to	1
remember	1
or	1
repeat	1
in	1
our	1
Western	1
civilization,	1
had,	1
however,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
said,	1
made	1
himself	1
quite	1
happy	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
mountain	1
hermitage	1
in	1
the	1
society	1
of	1
wild	1
animals.	1
And	1
now	1
that	1
his	1
luck	1
had	1
lifted	1
him	1
above	1
all	1
the	1
mountains	1
in	1
the	1
society	1
of	1
a	1
wild	1
physicist,	1
he	1
made	1
himself	1
happy	1
still.	1
"I	1
have	1
no	1
intention,	1
my	1
good	1
Michael,"	1
said	1
Professor	1
Lucifer,	1
"of	1
endeavouring	1
to	1
convert	1
you	1
by	1
argument.	1
The	1
imbecility	1
of	1
your	1
traditions	1
can	1
be	1
quite	1
finally	1
exhibited	1
to	1
anybody	1
with	1
mere	1
ordinary	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
the	1
same	1
kind	1
of	1
knowledge	1
which	1
teaches	1
us	1
not	1
to	1
sit	1
in	1
draughts	1
or	1
not	1
to	1
encourage	1
friendliness	1
in	1
impecunious	1
people.	1
It	1
is	1
folly	1
to	1
talk	1
of	1
this	1
or	1
that	1
demonstrating	1
the	1
rationalist	1
philosophy.	1
Everything	1
demonstrates	1
it.	1
Rubbing	1
shoulders	1
with	1
men	1
of	1
all	1
kinds----"	1
"You	1
will	1
forgive	1
me,"	1
said	1
the	1
monk,	1
meekly	1
from	1
under	1
loads	1
of	1
white	1
beard,	1
"but	1
I	1
fear	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
understand;	1
was	1
it	1
in	1
order	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
rub	1
my	1
shoulder	1
against	1
men	1
of	1
all	1
kinds	1
that	1
you	1
put	1
me	1
inside	1
this	1
thing?"	1
"An	1
entertaining	1
retort,	1
in	1
the	1
narrow	1
and	1
deductive	1
manner	1
of	1
the	1
Middle	1
Ages,"	1
replied	1
the	1
Professor,	1
calmly,	1
"but	1
even	1
upon	1
your	1
own	1
basis	1
I	1
will	1
illustrate	1
my	1
point.	1
We	1
are	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
sky.	1
In	1
your	1
religion	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
religions,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
I	1
know	1
(and	1
I	1
know	1
everything),	1
the	1
sky	1
is	1
made	1
the	1
symbol	1
of	1
everything	1
that	1
is	1
sacred	1
and	1
merciful.	1
Well,	1
now	1
you	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
sky,	1
you	1
know	1
better.	1
Phrase	1
it	1
how	1
you	1
like,	1
twist	1
it	1
how	1
you	1
like,	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
you	1
know	1
better.	1
You	1
know	1
what	1
are	1
a	1
man's	1
real	1
feelings	1
about	1
the	1
heavens,	1
when	1
he	1
finds	1
himself	1
alone	1
in	1
the	1
heavens,	1
surrounded	1
by	1
the	1
heavens.	1
You	1
know	1
the	1
truth,	1
and	1
the	1
truth	1
is	1
this.	1
The	1
heavens	1
are	1
evil,	1
the	1
sky	1
is	1
evil,	1
the	1
stars	1
are	1
evil.	1
This	1
mere	1
space,	1
this	1
mere	1
quantity,	1
terrifies	1
a	1
man	1
more	1
than	1
tigers	1
or	1
the	1
terrible	1
plague.	1
You	1
know	1
that	1
since	1
our	1
science	1
has	1
spoken,	1
the	1
bottom	1
has	1
fallen	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
Universe.	1
Now,	1
heaven	1
is	1
the	1
hopeless	1
thing,	1
more	1
hopeless	1
than	1
any	1
hell.	1
Now,	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
any	1
comfort	1
for	1
all	1
your	1
miserable	1
progeny	1
of	1
morbid	1
apes,	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
earth,	1
underneath	1
you,	1
under	1
the	1
roots	1
of	1
the	1
grass,	1
in	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
hell	1
was	1
of	1
old.	1
The	1
fiery	1
crypts,	1
the	1
lurid	1
cellars	1
of	1
the	1
underworld,	1
to	1
which	1
you	1
once	1
condemned	1
the	1
wicked,	1
are	1
hideous	1
enough,	1
but	1
at	1
least	1
they	1
are	1
more	1
homely	1
than	1
the	1
heaven	1
in	1
which	1
we	1
ride.	1
And	1
the	1
time	1
will	1
come	1
when	1
you	1
will	1
all	1
hide	1
in	1
them,	1
to	1
escape	1
the	1
horror	1
of	1
the	1
stars."	1
"I	1
hope	1
you	1
will	1
excuse	1
my	1
interrupting	1
you,"	1
said	1
Michael,	1
with	1
a	1
slight	1
cough,	1
"but	1
I	1
have	1
always	1
noticed----"	1
"Go	1
on,	1
pray	1
go	1
on,"	1
said	1
Professor	1
Lucifer,	1
radiantly,	1
"I	1
really	1
like	1
to	1
draw	1
out	1
your	1
simple	1
ideas."	1
"Well,	1
the	1
fact	1
is,"	1
said	1
the	1
other,	1
"that	1
much	1
as	1
I	1
admire	1
your	1
rhetoric	1
and	1
the	1
rhetoric	1
of	1
your	1
school,	1
from	1
a	1
purely	1
verbal	1
point	1
of	1
view,	1
such	1
little	1
study	1
of	1
you	1
and	1
your	1
school	1
in	1
human	1
history	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
enabled	1
to	1
make	1
has	1
led	1
me	1
to--er--rather	1
singular	1
conclusion,	1
which	1
I	1
find	1
great	1
difficulty	1
in	1
expressing,	1
especially	1
in	1
a	1
foreign	1
language."	1
"Come,	1
come,"	1
said	1
the	1
Professor,	1
encouragingly,	1
"I'll	1
help	1
you	1
out.	1
How	1
did	1
my	1
view	1
strike	1
you?"	1
"Well,	1
the	1
truth	1
is,	1
I	1
know	1
I	1
don't	1
express	1
it	1
properly,	1
but	1
somehow	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
you	1
always	1
convey	1
ideas	1
of	1
that	1
kind	1
with	1
most	1
eloquence,	1
when--er--when----"	1
"Oh!	1
get	1
on,"	1
cried	1
Lucifer,	1
boisterously.	1
"Well,	1
in	1
point	1
of	1
fact	1
when	1
your	1
flying	1
ship	1
is	1
just	1
going	1
to	1
run	1
into	1
something.	1
I	1
thought	1
you	1
wouldn't	1
mind	1
my	1
mentioning	1
it,	1
but	1
it's	1
running	1
into	1
something	1
now."	1
Lucifer	1
exploded	1
with	1
an	1
oath	1
and	1
leapt	1
erect,	1
leaning	1
hard	1
upon	1
the	1
handle	1
that	1
acted	1
as	1
a	1
helm	1
to	1
the	1
vessel.	1
For	1
the	1
last	1
ten	1
minutes	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
shooting	1
downwards	1
into	1
great	1
cracks	1
and	1
caverns	1
of	1
cloud.	1
Now,	1
through	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
purple	1
haze,	1
could	1
be	1
seen	1
comparatively	1
near	1
to	1
them	1
what	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
upper	1
part	1
of	1
a	1
huge,	1
dark	1
orb	1
or	1
sphere,	1
islanded	1
in	1
a	1
sea	1
of	1
cloud.	1
The	1
Professor's	1
eyes	1
were	1
blazing	1
like	1
a	1
maniac's.	1
"It	1
is	1
a	1
new	1
world,"	1
he	1
cried,	1
with	1
a	1
dreadful	1
mirth.	1
"It	1
is	1
a	1
new	1
planet	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
bear	1
my	1
name.	1
This	1
star	1
and	1
not	1
that	1
other	1
vulgar	1
one	1
shall	1
be	1
'Lucifer,	1
sun	1
of	1
the	1
morning.'	1
Here	1
we	1
will	1
have	1
no	1
chartered	1
lunacies,	1
here	1
we	1
will	1
have	1
no	1
gods.	1
Here	1
man	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
innocent	1
as	1
the	1
daisies,	1
as	1
innocent	1
and	1
as	1
cruel--here	1
the	1
intellect----"	1
"There	1
seems,"	1
said	1
Michael,	1
timidly,	1
"to	1
be	1
something	1
sticking	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
it."	1
"So	1
there	1
is,"	1
said	1
the	1
Professor,	1
leaning	1
over	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
ship,	1
his	1
spectacles	1
shining	1
with	1
intellectual	1
excitement.	1
"What	1
can	1
it	1
be?	1
It	1
might	1
of	1
course	1
be	1
merely	1
a----"	1
Then	1
a	1
shriek	1
indescribable	1
broke	1
out	1
of	1
him	1
of	1
a	1
sudden,	1
and	1
he	1
flung	1
up	1
his	1
arms	1
like	1
a	1
lost	1
spirit.	1
The	1
monk	1
took	1
the	1
helm	1
in	1
a	1
tired	1
way;	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
much	1
astonished	1
for	1
he	1
came	1
from	1
an	1
ignorant	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
in	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
uncommon	1
for	1
lost	1
spirits	1
to	1
shriek	1
when	1
they	1
see	1
the	1
curious	1
shape	1
which	1
the	1
Professor	1
had	1
just	1
seen	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
mysterious	1
ball,	1
but	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
helm	1
only	1
just	1
in	1
time,	1
and	1
by	1
driving	1
it	1
hard	1
to	1
the	1
left	1
he	1
prevented	1
the	1
flying	1
ship	1
from	1
smashing	1
into	1
St.	1
Paul's	1
Cathedral.	1
A	1
plain	1
of	1
sad-coloured	1
cloud	1
lay	1
along	1
the	1
level	1
of	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
Cathedral	1
dome,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
ball	1
and	1
the	1
cross	1
looked	1
like	1
a	1
buoy	1
riding	1
on	1
a	1
leaden	1
sea.	1
As	1
the	1
flying	1
ship	1
swept	1
towards	1
it,	1
this	1
plain	1
of	1
cloud	1
looked	1
as	1
dry	1
and	1
definite	1
and	1
rocky	1
as	1
any	1
grey	1
desert.	1
Hence	1
it	1
gave	1
to	1
the	1
mind	1
and	1
body	1
a	1
sharp	1
and	1
unearthly	1
sensation	1
when	1
the	1
ship	1
cut	1
and	1
sank	1
into	1
the	1
cloud	1
as	1
into	1
any	1
common	1
mist,	1
a	1
thing	1
without	1
resistance.	1
There	1
was,	1
as	1
it	1
were,	1
a	1
deadly	1
shock	1
in	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
shock.	1
It	1
was	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
cloven	1
into	1
ancient	1
cliffs	1
like	1
so	1
much	1
butter.	1
But	1
sensations	1
awaited	1
them	1
which	1
were	1
much	1
stranger	1
than	1
those	1
of	1
sinking	1
through	1
the	1
solid	1
earth.	1
For	1
a	1
moment	1
their	1
eyes	1
and	1
nostrils	1
were	1
stopped	1
with	1
darkness	1
and	1
opaque	1
cloud;	1
then	1
the	1
darkness	1
warmed	1
into	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
brown	1
fog.	1
And	1
far,	1
far	1
below	1
them	1
the	1
brown	1
fog	1
fell	1
until	1
it	1
warmed	1
into	1
fire.	1
Through	1
the	1
dense	1
London	1
atmosphere	1
they	1
could	1
see	1
below	1
them	1
the	1
flaming	1
London	1
lights;	1
lights	1
which	1
lay	1
beneath	1
them	1
in	1
squares	1
and	1
oblongs	1
of	1
fire.	1
The	1
fog	1
and	1
fire	1
were	1
mixed	1
in	1
a	1
passionate	1
vapour;	1
you	1
might	1
say	1
that	1
the	1
fog	1
was	1
drowning	1
the	1
flames;	1
or	1
you	1
might	1
say	1
that	1
the	1
flames	1
had	1
set	1
the	1
fog	1
on	1
fire.	1
Beside	1
the	1
ship	1
and	1
beneath	1
it	1
(for	1
it	1
swung	1
just	1
under	1
the	1
ball),	1
the	1
immeasurable	1
dome	1
itself	1
shot	1
out	1
and	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
dark	1
like	1
a	1
combination	1
of	1
voiceless	1
cataracts.	1
Or	1
it	1
was	1
like	1
some	1
cyclopean	1
sea-beast	1
sitting	1
above	1
London	1
and	1
letting	1
down	1
its	1
tentacles	1
bewilderingly	1
on	1
every	1
side,	1
a	1
monstrosity	1
in	1
that	1
starless	1
heaven.	1
For	1
the	1
clouds	1
that	1
belonged	1
to	1
London	1
had	1
closed	1
over	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
the	1
voyagers	1
sealing	1
up	1
the	1
entrance	1
of	1
the	1
upper	1
air.	1
They	1
had	1
broken	1
through	1
a	1
roof	1
and	1
come	1
into	1
a	1
temple	1
of	1
twilight.	1
They	1
were	1
so	1
near	1
to	1
the	1
ball	1
that	1
Lucifer	1
leaned	1
his	1
hand	1
against	1
it,	1
holding	1
the	1
vessel	1
away,	1
as	1
men	1
push	1
a	1
boat	1
off	1
from	1
a	1
bank.	1
Above	1
it	1
the	1
cross	1
already	1
draped	1
in	1
the	1
dark	1
mists	1
of	1
the	1
borderland	1
was	1
shadowy	1
and	1
more	1
awful	1
in	1
shape	1
and	1
size.	1
Professor	1
Lucifer	1
slapped	1
his	1
hand	1
twice	1
upon	1
the	1
surface	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
orb	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
caressing	1
some	1
enormous	1
animal.	1
"This	1
is	1
the	1
fellow,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"this	1
is	1
the	1
one	1
for	1
my	1
money."	1
"May	1
I	1
with	1
all	1
respect	1
inquire,"	1
asked	1
the	1
old	1
monk,	1
"what	1
on	1
earth	1
you	1
are	1
talking	1
about?"	1
"Why	1
this,"	1
cried	1
Lucifer,	1
smiting	1
the	1
ball	1
again,	1
"here	1
is	1
the	1
only	1
symbol,	1
my	1
boy.	1
So	1
fat.	1
So	1
satisfied.	1
Not	1
like	1
that	1
scraggy	1
individual,	1
stretching	1
his	1
arms	1
in	1
stark	1
weariness."	1
And	1
he	1
pointed	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
cross,	1
his	1
face	1
dark	1
with	1
a	1
grin.	1
"I	1
was	1
telling	1
you	1
just	1
now,	1
Michael,	1
that	1
I	1
can	1
prove	1
the	1
best	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
rationalist	1
case	1
and	1
the	1
Christian	1
humbug	1
from	1
any	1
symbol	1
you	1
liked	1
to	1
give	1
me,	1
from	1
any	1
instance	1
I	1
came	1
across.	1
Here	1
is	1
an	1
instance	1
with	1
a	1
vengeance.	1
What	1
could	1
possibly	1
express	1
your	1
philosophy	1
and	1
my	1
philosophy	1
better	1
than	1
the	1
shape	1
of	1
that	1
cross	1
and	1
the	1
shape	1
of	1
this	1
ball?	1
This	1
globe	1
is	1
reasonable;	1
that	1
cross	1
is	1
unreasonable.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
four-legged	1
animal,	1
with	1
one	1
leg	1
longer	1
than	1
the	1
others.	1
The	1
globe	1
is	1
inevitable.	1
The	1
cross	1
is	1
arbitrary.	1
Above	1
all	1
the	1
globe	1
is	1
at	1
unity	1
with	1
itself;	1
the	1
cross	1
is	1
primarily	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
things	1
at	1
enmity	1
with	1
itself.	1
The	1
cross	1
is	1
the	1
conflict	1
of	1
two	1
hostile	1
lines,	1
of	1
irreconcilable	1
direction.	1
That	1
silent	1
thing	1
up	1
there	1
is	1
essentially	1
a	1
collision,	1
a	1
crash,	1
a	1
struggle	1
in	1
stone.	1
Pah!	1
that	1
sacred	1
symbol	1
of	1
yours	1
has	1
actually	1
given	1
its	1
name	1
to	1
a	1
description	1
of	1
desperation	1
and	1
muddle.	1
When	1
we	1
speak	1
of	1
men	1
at	1
once	1
ignorant	1
of	1
each	1
other	1
and	1
frustrated	1
by	1
each	1
other,	1
we	1
say	1
they	1
are	1
at	1
cross-purposes.	1
Away	1
with	1
the	1
thing!	1
The	1
very	1
shape	1
of	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
contradiction	1
in	1
terms."	1
"What	1
you	1
say	1
is	1
perfectly	1
true,"	1
said	1
Michael,	1
with	1
serenity.	1
"But	1
we	1
like	1
contradictions	1
in	1
terms.	1
Man	1
is	1
a	1
contradiction	1
in	1
terms;	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
beast	1
whose	1
superiority	1
to	1
other	1
beasts	1
consists	1
in	1
having	1
fallen.	1
That	1
cross	1
is,	1
as	1
you	1
say,	1
an	1
eternal	1
collision;	1
so	1
am	1
I.	1
That	1
is	1
a	1
struggle	1
in	1
stone.	1
Every	1
form	1
of	1
life	1
is	1
a	1
struggle	1
in	1
flesh.	1
The	1
shape	1
of	1
the	1
cross	1
is	1
irrational,	1
just	1
as	1
the	1
shape	1
of	1
the	1
human	1
animal	1
is	1
irrational.	1
You	1
say	1
the	1
cross	1
is	1
a	1
quadruped	1
with	1
one	1
limb	1
longer	1
than	1
the	1
rest.	1
I	1
say	1
man	1
is	1
a	1
quadruped	1
who	1
only	1
uses	1
two	1
of	1
his	1
legs."	1
The	1
Professor	1
frowned	1
thoughtfully	1
for	1
an	1
instant,	1
and	1
said:	1
"Of	1
course	1
everything	1
is	1
relative,	1
and	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
deny	1
that	1
the	1
element	1
of	1
struggle	1
and	1
self-contradiction,	1
represented	1
by	1
that	1
cross,	1
has	1
a	1
necessary	1
place	1
at	1
a	1
certain	1
evolutionary	1
stage.	1
But	1
surely	1
the	1
cross	1
is	1
the	1
lower	1
development	1
and	1
the	1
sphere	1
the	1
higher.	1
After	1
all	1
it	1
is	1
easy	1
enough	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
is	1
really	1
wrong	1
with	1
Wren's	1
architectural	1
arrangement."	1
"And	1
what	1
is	1
that,	1
pray?"	1
inquired	1
Michael,	1
meekly.	1
"The	1
cross	1
is	1
on	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
ball,"	1
said	1
Professor	1
Lucifer,	1
simply.	1
"That	1
is	1
surely	1
wrong.	1
The	1
ball	1
should	1
be	1
on	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
cross.	1
The	1
cross	1
is	1
a	1
mere	1
barbaric	1
prop;	1
the	1
ball	1
is	1
perfection.	1
The	1
cross	1
at	1
its	1
best	1
is	1
but	1
the	1
bitter	1
tree	1
of	1
man's	1
history;	1
the	1
ball	1
is	1
the	1
rounded,	1
the	1
ripe	1
and	1
final	1
fruit.	1
And	1
the	1
fruit	1
should	1
be	1
at	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
tree,	1
not	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
it."	1
"Oh!"	1
said	1
the	1
monk,	1
a	1
wrinkle	1
coming	1
into	1
his	1
forehead,	1
"so	1
you	1
think	1
that	1
in	1
a	1
rationalistic	1
scheme	1
of	1
symbolism	1
the	1
ball	1
should	1
be	1
on	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
cross?"	1
"It	1
sums	1
up	1
my	1
whole	1
allegory,"	1
said	1
the	1
professor.	1
"Well,	1
that	1
is	1
really	1
very	1
interesting,"	1
resumed	1
Michael	1
slowly,	1
"because	1
I	1
think	1
in	1
that	1
case	1
you	1
would	1
see	1
a	1
most	1
singular	1
effect,	1
an	1
effect	1
that	1
has	1
generally	1
been	1
achieved	1
by	1
all	1
those	1
able	1
and	1
powerful	1
systems	1
which	1
rationalism,	1
or	1
the	1
religion	1
of	1
the	1
ball,	1
has	1
produced	1
to	1
lead	1
or	1
teach	1
mankind.	1
You	1
would	1
see,	1
I	1
think,	1
that	1
thing	1
happen	1
which	1
is	1
always	1
the	1
ultimate	1
embodiment	1
and	1
logical	1
outcome	1
of	1
your	1
logical	1
scheme."	1
"What	1
are	1
you	1
talking	1
about?"	1
asked	1
Lucifer.	1
"What	1
would	1
happen?"	1
"I	1
mean	1
it	1
would	1
fall	1
down,"	1
said	1
the	1
monk,	1
looking	1
wistfully	1
into	1
the	1
void.	1
Lucifer	1
made	1
an	1
angry	1
movement	1
and	1
opened	1
his	1
mouth	1
to	1
speak,	1
but	1
Michael,	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
air	1
of	1
deliberation,	1
was	1
proceeding	1
before	1
he	1
could	1
bring	1
out	1
a	1
word.	1
"I	1
once	1
knew	1
a	1
man	1
like	1
you,	1
Lucifer,"	1
he	1
said,	1
with	1
a	1
maddening	1
monotony	1
and	1
slowness	1
of	1
articulation.	1
"He	1
took	1
this----"	1
"There	1
is	1
no	1
man	1
like	1
me,"	1
cried	1
Lucifer,	1
with	1
a	1
violence	1
that	1
shook	1
the	1
ship.	1
"As	1
I	1
was	1
observing,"	1
continued	1
Michael,	1
"this	1
man	1
also	1
took	1
the	1
view	1
that	1
the	1
symbol	1
of	1
Christianity	1
was	1
a	1
symbol	1
of	1
savagery	1
and	1
all	1
unreason.	1
His	1
history	1
is	1
rather	1
amusing.	1
It	1
is	1
also	1
a	1
perfect	1
allegory	1
of	1
what	1
happens	1
to	1
rationalists	1
like	1
yourself.	1
He	1
began,	1
of	1
course,	1
by	1
refusing	1
to	1
allow	1
a	1
crucifix	1
in	1
his	1
house,	1
or	1
round	1
his	1
wife's	1
neck,	1
or	1
even	1
in	1
a	1
picture.	1
He	1
said,	1
as	1
you	1
say,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
an	1
arbitrary	1
and	1
fantastic	1
shape,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
monstrosity,	1
loved	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
paradoxical.	1
Then	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
grow	1
fiercer	1
and	1
more	1
eccentric;	1
he	1
would	1
batter	1
the	1
crosses	1
by	1
the	1
roadside;	1
for	1
he	1
lived	1
in	1
a	1
Roman	1
Catholic	1
country.	1
Finally	1
in	1
a	1
height	1
of	1
frenzy	1
he	1
climbed	1
the	1
steeple	1
of	1
the	1
Parish	1
Church	1
and	1
tore	1
down	1
the	1
cross,	1
waving	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
air,	1
and	1
uttering	1
wild	1
soliloquies	1
up	1
there	1
under	1
the	1
stars.	1
Then	1
one	1
still	1
summer	1
evening	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
wending	1
his	1
way	1
homewards,	1
along	1
a	1
lane,	1
the	1
devil	1
of	1
his	1
madness	1
came	1
upon	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
violence	1
and	1
transfiguration	1
which	1
changes	1
the	1
world.	1
He	1
was	1
standing	1
smoking,	1
for	1
a	1
moment,	1
in	1
the	1
front	1
of	1
an	1
interminable	1
line	1
of	1
palings,	1
when	1
his	1
eyes	1
were	1
opened.	1
Not	1
a	1
light	1
shifted,	1
not	1
a	1
leaf	1
stirred,	1
but	1
he	1
saw	1
as	1
if	1
by	1
a	1
sudden	1
change	1
in	1
the	1
eyesight	1
that	1
this	1
paling	1
was	1
an	1
army	1
of	1
innumerable	1
crosses	1
linked	1
together	1
over	1
hill	1
and	1
dale.	1
And	1
he	1
whirled	1
up	1
his	1
heavy	1
stick	1
and	1
went	1
at	1
it	1
as	1
if	1
at	1
an	1
army.	1
Mile	1
after	1
mile	1
along	1
his	1
homeward	1
path	1
he	1
broke	1
it	1
down	1
and	1
tore	1
it	1
up.	1
For	1
he	1
hated	1
the	1
cross	1
and	1
every	1
paling	1
is	1
a	1
wall	1
of	1
crosses.	1
When	1
he	1
returned	1
to	1
his	1
house	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
literal	1
madman.	1
He	1
sat	1
upon	1
a	1
chair	1
and	1
then	1
started	1
up	1
from	1
it	1
for	1
the	1
cross-bars	1
of	1
the	1
carpentry	1
repeated	1
the	1
intolerable	1
image.	1
He	1
flung	1
himself	1
upon	1
a	1
bed	1
only	1
to	1
remember	1
that	1
this,	1
too,	1
like	1
all	1
workmanlike	1
things,	1
was	1
constructed	1
on	1
the	1
accursed	1
plan.	1
He	1
broke	1
his	1
furniture	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
made	1
of	1
crosses.	1
He	1
burnt	1
his	1
house	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
made	1
of	1
crosses.	1
He	1
was	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
river."	1
Lucifer	1
was	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
bitten	1
lip.	1
"Is	1
that	1
story	1
really	1
true?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
"Oh,	1
no,"	1
said	1
Michael,	1
airily.	1
"It	1
is	1
a	1
parable.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
parable	1
of	1
you	1
and	1
all	1
your	1
rationalists.	1
You	1
begin	1
by	1
breaking	1
up	1
the	1
Cross;	1
but	1
you	1
end	1
by	1
breaking	1
up	1
the	1
habitable	1
world.	1
We	1
leave	1
you	1
saying	1
that	1
nobody	1
ought	1
to	1
join	1
the	1
Church	1
against	1
his	1
will.	1
When	1
we	1
meet	1
you	1
again	1
you	1
are	1
saying	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
has	1
any	1
will	1
to	1
join	1
it	1
with.	1
We	1
leave	1
you	1
saying	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
such	1
place	1
as	1
Eden.	1
We	1
find	1
you	1
saying	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
such	1
place	1
as	1
Ireland.	1
You	1
start	1
by	1
hating	1
the	1
irrational	1
and	1
you	1
come	1
to	1
hate	1
everything,	1
for	1
everything	1
is	1
irrational	1
and	1
so----"	1
Lucifer	1
leapt	1
upon	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
cry	1
like	1
a	1
wild	1
beast's.	1
"Ah,"	1
he	1
screamed,	1
"to	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
madness.	1
You	1
are	1
mad	1
on	1
the	1
cross.	1
Let	1
it	1
save	1
you."	1
And	1
with	1
a	1
herculean	1
energy	1
he	1
forced	1
the	1
monk	1
backwards	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
reeling	1
car	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
upper	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
stone	1
ball.	1
Michael,	1
with	1
as	1
abrupt	1
an	1
agility,	1
caught	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
beams	1
of	1
the	1
cross	1
and	1
saved	1
himself	1
from	1
falling.	1
At	1
the	1
same	1
instant	1
Lucifer	1
drove	1
down	1
a	1
lever	1
and	1
the	1
ship	1
shot	1
up	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
it	1
alone.	1
"Ha!	1
ha!"	1
he	1
yelled,	1
"what	1
sort	1
of	1
a	1
support	1
do	1
you	1
find	1
it,	1
old	1
fellow?"	1
"For	1
practical	1
purposes	1
of	1
support,"	1
replied	1
Michael	1
grimly,	1
"it	1
is	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
better	1
than	1
the	1
ball.	1
May	1
I	1
ask	1
if	1
you	1
are	1
going	1
to	1
leave	1
me	1
here?"	1
"Yes,	1
yes.	1
I	1
mount!	1
I	1
mount!"	1
cried	1
the	1
professor	1
in	1
ungovernable	1
excitement.	1
"_Altiora	1
peto_.	1
My	1
path	1
is	1
upward."	1
"How	1
often	1
have	1
you	1
told	1
me,	1
Professor,	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
really	1
no	1
up	1
or	1
down	1
in	1
space?"	1
said	1
the	1
monk.	1
"I	1
shall	1
mount	1
up	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
you	1
will."	1
"Indeed,"	1
said	1
Lucifer,	1
leering	1
over	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
flying	1
ship.	1
"May	1
I	1
ask	1
what	1
you	1
are	1
going	1
to	1
do?"	1
The	1
monk	1
pointed	1
downward	1
at	1
Ludgate	1
Hill.	1
"I	1
am	1
going,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"to	1
climb	1
up	1
into	1
a	1
star."	1
Those	1
who	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
matter	1
most	1
superficially	1
regard	1
paradox	1
as	1
something	1
which	1
belongs	1
to	1
jesting	1
and	1
light	1
journalism.	1
Paradox	1
of	1
this	1
kind	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
saying	1
of	1
the	1
dandy,	1
in	1
the	1
decadent	1
comedy,	1
"Life	1
is	1
much	1
too	1
important	1
to	1
be	1
taken	1
seriously."	1
Those	1
who	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
matter	1
a	1
little	1
more	1
deeply	1
or	1
delicately	1
see	1
that	1
paradox	1
is	1
a	1
thing	1
which	1
especially	1
belongs	1
to	1
all	1
religions.	1
Paradox	1
of	1
this	1
kind	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
saying	1
as	1
"The	1
meek	1
shall	1
inherit	1
the	1
earth."	1
But	1
those	1
who	1
see	1
and	1
feel	1
the	1
fundamental	1
fact	1
of	1
the	1
matter	1
know	1
that	1
paradox	1
is	1
a	1
thing	1
which	1
belongs	1
not	1
to	1
religion	1
only,	1
but	1
to	1
all	1
vivid	1
and	1
violent	1
practical	1
crises	1
of	1
human	1
living.	1
This	1
kind	1
of	1
paradox	1
may	1
be	1
clearly	1
perceived	1
by	1
anybody	1
who	1
happens	1
to	1
be	1
hanging	1
in	1
mid-space,	1
clinging	1
to	1
one	1
arm	1
of	1
the	1
Cross	1
of	1
St.	1
Paul's.	1
Father	1
Michael	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
years,	1
and	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
asceticism	1
(or	1
because	1
of	1
it,	1
for	1
all	1
I	1
know),	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
healthy	1
and	1
happy	1
old	1
gentleman.	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
swung	1
on	1
a	1
bar	1
above	1
the	1
sickening	1
emptiness	1
of	1
air,	1
he	1
realized,	1
with	1
that	1
sort	1
of	1
dead	1
detachment	1
which	1
belongs	1
to	1
the	1
brains	1
of	1
those	1
in	1
peril,	1
the	1
deathless	1
and	1
hopeless	1
contradiction	1
which	1
is	1
involved	1
in	1
the	1
mere	1
idea	1
of	1
courage.	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
happy	1
and	1
healthy	1
old	1
gentleman	1
and	1
therefore	1
he	1
was	1
quite	1
careless	1
about	1
it.	1
And	1
he	1
felt	1
as	1
every	1
man	1
feels	1
in	1
the	1
taut	1
moment	1
of	1
such	1
terror	1
that	1
his	1
chief	1
danger	1
was	1
terror	1
itself;	1
his	1
only	1
possible	1
strength	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
coolness	1
amounting	1
to	1
carelessness,	1
a	1
carelessness	1
amounting	1
almost	1
to	1
a	1
suicidal	1
swagger.	1
His	1
one	1
wild	1
chance	1
of	1
coming	1
out	1
safely	1
would	1
be	1
in	1
not	1
too	1
desperately	1
desiring	1
to	1
be	1
safe.	1
There	1
might	1
be	1
footholds	1
down	1
that	1
awful	1
facade,	1
if	1
only	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
care	1
whether	1
they	1
were	1
footholds	1
or	1
no.	1
If	1
he	1
were	1
foolhardy	1
he	1
might	1
escape;	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
wise	1
he	1
would	1
stop	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
till	1
he	1
dropped	1
from	1
the	1
cross	1
like	1
a	1
stone.	1
And	1
this	1
antinomy	1
kept	1
on	1
repeating	1
itself	1
in	1
his	1
mind,	1
a	1
contradiction	1
as	1
large	1
and	1
staring	1
as	1
the	1
immense	1
contradiction	1
of	1
the	1
Cross;	1
he	1
remembered	1
having	1
often	1
heard	1
the	1
words,	1
"Whosoever	1
shall	1
lose	1
his	1
life	1
the	1
same	1
shall	1
save	1
it."	1
He	1
remembered	1
with	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
strange	1
pity	1
that	1
this	1
had	1
always	1
been	1
made	1
to	1
mean	1
that	1
whoever	1
lost	1
his	1
physical	1
life	1
should	1
save	1
his	1
spiritual	1
life.	1
Now	1
he	1
knew	1
the	1
truth	1
that	1
is	1
known	1
to	1
all	1
fighters,	1
and	1
hunters,	1
and	1
climbers	1
of	1
cliffs.	1
He	1
knew	1
that	1
even	1
his	1
animal	1
life	1
could	1
only	1
be	1
saved	1
by	1
a	1
considerable	1
readiness	1
to	1
lose	1
it.	1
Some	1
will	1
think	1
it	1
improbable	1
that	1
a	1
human	1
soul	1
swinging	1
desperately	1
in	1
mid-air	1
should	1
think	1
about	1
philosophical	1
inconsistencies.	1
But	1
such	1
extreme	1
states	1
are	1
dangerous	1
things	1
to	1
dogmatize	1
about.	1
Frequently	1
they	1
produce	1
a	1
certain	1
useless	1
and	1
joyless	1
activity	1
of	1
the	1
mere	1
intellect,	1
thought	1
not	1
only	1
divorced	1
from	1
hope	1
but	1
even	1
from	1
desire.	1
And	1
if	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
to	1
dogmatize	1
about	1
such	1
states,	1
it	1
is	1
still	1
more	1
impossible	1
to	1
describe	1
them.	1
To	1
this	1
spasm	1
of	1
sanity	1
and	1
clarity	1
in	1
Michael's	1
mind	1
succeeded	1
a	1
spasm	1
of	1
the	1
elemental	1
terror;	1
the	1
terror	1
of	1
the	1
animal	1
in	1
us	1
which	1
regards	1
the	1
whole	1
universe	1
as	1
its	1
enemy;	1
which,	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
victorious,	1
has	1
no	1
pity,	1
and	1
so,	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
defeated	1
has	1
no	1
imaginable	1
hope.	1
Of	1
that	1
ten	1
minutes	1
of	1
terror	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
possible	1
to	1
speak	1
in	1
human	1
words.	1
But	1
then	1
again	1
in	1
that	1
damnable	1
darkness	1
there	1
began	1
to	1
grow	1
a	1
strange	1
dawn	1
as	1
of	1
grey	1
and	1
pale	1
silver.	1
And	1
of	1
this	1
ultimate	1
resignation	1
or	1
certainty	1
it	1
is	1
even	1
less	1
possible	1
to	1
write;	1
it	1
is	1
something	1
stranger	1
than	1
hell	1
itself;	1
it	1
is	1
perhaps	1
the	1
last	1
of	1
the	1
secrets	1
of	1
God.	1
At	1
the	1
highest	1
crisis	1
of	1
some	1
incurable	1
anguish	1
there	1
will	1
suddenly	1
fall	1
upon	1
the	1
man	1
the	1
stillness	1
of	1
an	1
insane	1
contentment.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
hope,	1
for	1
hope	1
is	1
broken	1
and	1
romantic	1
and	1
concerned	1
with	1
the	1
future;	1
this	1
is	1
complete	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
present.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
faith,	1
for	1
faith	1
by	1
its	1
very	1
nature	1
is	1
fierce,	1
and	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
at	1
once	1
doubtful	1
and	1
defiant;	1
but	1
this	1
is	1
simply	1
a	1
satisfaction.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
knowledge,	1
for	1
the	1
intellect	1
seems	1
to	1
have	1
no	1
particular	1
part	1
in	1
it.	1
Nor	1
is	1
it	1
(as	1
the	1
modern	1
idiots	1
would	1
certainly	1
say	1
it	1
is)	1
a	1
mere	1
numbness	1
or	1
negative	1
paralysis	1
of	1
the	1
powers	1
of	1
grief.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
negative	1
in	1
the	1
least;	1
it	1
is	1
as	1
positive	1
as	1
good	1
news.	1
In	1
some	1
sense,	1
indeed,	1
it	1
is	1
good	1
news.	1
It	1
seems	1
almost	1
as	1
if	1
there	1
were	1
some	1
equality	1
among	1
things,	1
some	1
balance	1
in	1
all	1
possible	1
contingencies	1
which	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
permitted	1
to	1
know	1
lest	1
we	1
should	1
learn	1
indifference	1
to	1
good	1
and	1
evil,	1
but	1
which	1
is	1
sometimes	1
shown	1
to	1
us	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
as	1
a	1
last	1
aid	1
in	1
our	1
last	1
agony.	1
Michael	1
certainly	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
given	1
any	1
sort	1
of	1
rational	1
account	1
of	1
this	1
vast	1
unmeaning	1
satisfaction	1
which	1
soaked	1
through	1
him	1
and	1
filled	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
brim.	1
He	1
felt	1
with	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
half-witted	1
lucidity	1
that	1
the	1
cross	1
was	1
there,	1
and	1
the	1
ball	1
was	1
there,	1
and	1
the	1
dome	1
was	1
there,	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
climb	1
down	1
from	1
them,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
mind	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
whether	1
he	1
was	1
killed	1
or	1
not.	1
This	1
mysterious	1
mood	1
lasted	1
long	1
enough	1
to	1
start	1
him	1
on	1
his	1
dreadful	1
descent	1
and	1
to	1
force	1
him	1
to	1
continue	1
it.	1
But	1
six	1
times	1
before	1
he	1
reached	1
the	1
highest	1
of	1
the	1
outer	1
galleries	1
terror	1
had	1
returned	1
on	1
him	1
like	1
a	1
flying	1
storm	1
of	1
darkness	1
and	1
thunder.	1
By	1
the	1
time	1
he	1
had	1
reached	1
that	1
place	1
of	1
safety	1
he	1
almost	1
felt	1
(as	1
in	1
some	1
impossible	1
fit	1
of	1
drunkenness)	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
two	1
heads;	1
one	1
was	1
calm,	1
careless,	1
and	1
efficient;	1
the	1
other	1
saw	1
the	1
danger	1
like	1
a	1
deadly	1
map,	1
was	1
wise,	1
careful,	1
and	1
useless.	1
He	1
had	1
fancied	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
let	1
himself	1
vertically	1
down	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
building.	1
When	1
he	1
dropped	1
into	1
the	1
upper	1
gallery	1
he	1
still	1
felt	1
as	1
far	1
from	1
the	1
terrestrial	1
globe	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
only	1
dropped	1
from	1
the	1
sun	1
to	1
the	1
moon.	1
He	1
paused	1
a	1
little,	1
panting	1
in	1
the	1
gallery	1
under	1
the	1
ball,	1
and	1
idly	1
kicked	1
his	1
heels,	1
moving	1
a	1
few	1
yards	1
along	1
it.	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
so	1
a	1
thunderbolt	1
struck	1
his	1
soul.	1
A	1
man,	1
a	1
heavy,	1
ordinary	1
man,	1
with	1
a	1
composed	1
indifferent	1
face,	1
and	1
a	1
prosaic	1
sort	1
of	1
uniform,	1
with	1
a	1
row	1
of	1
buttons,	1
blocked	1
his	1
way.	1
Michael	1
had	1
no	1
mind	1
to	1
wonder	1
whether	1
this	1
solid	1
astonished	1
man,	1
with	1
the	1
brown	1
moustache	1
and	1
the	1
nickel	1
buttons,	1
had	1
also	1
come	1
on	1
a	1
flying	1
ship.	1
He	1
merely	1
let	1
his	1
mind	1
float	1
in	1
an	1
endless	1
felicity	1
about	1
the	1
man.	1
He	1
thought	1
how	1
nice	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
live	1
up	1
in	1
that	1
gallery	1
with	1
that	1
one	1
man	1
for	1
ever.	1
He	1
thought	1
how	1
he	1
would	1
luxuriate	1
in	1
the	1
nameless	1
shades	1
of	1
this	1
man's	1
soul	1
and	1
then	1
hear	1
with	1
an	1
endless	1
excitement	1
about	1
the	1
nameless	1
shades	1
of	1
the	1
souls	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
aunts	1
and	1
uncles.	1
A	1
moment	1
before	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
dying	1
alone.	1
Now	1
he	1
was	1
living	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
world	1
with	1
a	1
man;	1
an	1
inexhaustible	1
ecstasy.	1
In	1
the	1
gallery	1
below	1
the	1
ball	1
Father	1
Michael	1
had	1
found	1
that	1
man	1
who	1
is	1
the	1
noblest	1
and	1
most	1
divine	1
and	1
most	1
lovable	1
of	1
all	1
men,	1
better	1
than	1
all	1
the	1
saints,	1
greater	1
than	1
all	1
the	1
heroes--man	1
Friday.	1
In	1
the	1
confused	1
colour	1
and	1
music	1
of	1
his	1
new	1
paradise,	1
Michael	1
heard	1
only	1
in	1
a	1
faint	1
and	1
distant	1
fashion	1
some	1
remarks	1
that	1
this	1
beautiful	1
solid	1
man	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
making	1
to	1
him;	1
remarks	1
about	1
something	1
or	1
other	1
being	1
after	1
hours	1
and	1
against	1
orders.	1
He	1
also	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
asking	1
how	1
Michael	1
"got	1
up"	1
there.	1
This	1
beautiful	1
man	1
evidently	1
felt	1
as	1
Michael	1
did	1
that	1
the	1
earth	1
was	1
a	1
star	1
and	1
was	1
set	1
in	1
heaven.	1
At	1
length	1
Michael	1
sated	1
himself	1
with	1
the	1
mere	1
sensual	1
music	1
of	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
in	1
buttons.	1
He	1
began	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
what	1
he	1
said,	1
and	1
even	1
to	1
make	1
some	1
attempt	1
at	1
answering	1
a	1
question	1
which	1
appeared	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
put	1
several	1
times	1
and	1
was	1
now	1
put	1
with	1
some	1
excess	1
of	1
emphasis.	1
Michael	1
realized	1
that	1
the	1
image	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
nickel	1
buttons	1
was	1
asking	1
him	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
there.	1
He	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
in	1
Lucifer's	1
ship.	1
On	1
his	1
giving	1
this	1
answer	1
the	1
demeanour	1
of	1
the	1
image	1
of	1
God	1
underwent	1
a	1
remarkable	1
change.	1
From	1
addressing	1
Michael	1
gruffly,	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
a	1
malefactor,	1
he	1
began	1
suddenly	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
eager	1
and	1
feverish	1
amiability	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
a	1
child.	1
He	1
seemed	1
particularly	1
anxious	1
to	1
coax	1
him	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
balustrade.	1
He	1
led	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
arm	1
towards	1
a	1
door	1
leading	1
into	1
the	1
building	1
itself,	1
soothing	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
time.	1
He	1
gave	1
what	1
even	1
Michael	1
(slight	1
as	1
was	1
his	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
world)	1
felt	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
improbable	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
sumptuous	1
pleasures	1
and	1
varied	1
advantages	1
awaiting	1
him	1
downstairs.	1
Michael	1
followed	1
him,	1
however,	1
if	1
only	1
out	1
of	1
politeness,	1
down	1
an	1
apparently	1
interminable	1
spiral	1
of	1
staircase.	1
At	1
one	1
point	1
a	1
door	1
opened.	1
Michael	1
stepped	1
through	1
it,	1
and	1
the	1
unaccountable	1
man	1
in	1
buttons	1
leapt	1
after	1
him	1
and	1
pinioned	1
him	1
where	1
he	1
stood.	1
But	1
he	1
only	1
wished	1
to	1
stand;	1
to	1
stand	1
and	1
stare.	1
He	1
had	1
stepped	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
into	1
another	1
infinity,	1
out	1
under	1
the	1
dome	1
of	1
another	1
heaven.	1
But	1
this	1
was	1
a	1
dome	1
of	1
heaven	1
made	1
by	1
man.	1
The	1
gold	1
and	1
green	1
and	1
crimson	1
of	1
its	1
sunset	1
were	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
shapeless	1
clouds	1
but	1
in	1
shapes	1
of	1
cherubim	1
and	1
seraphim,	1
awful	1
human	1
shapes	1
with	1
a	1
passionate	1
plumage.	1
Its	1
stars	1
were	1
not	1
above	1
but	1
far	1
below,	1
like	1
fallen	1
stars	1
still	1
in	1
unbroken	1
constellations;	1
the	1
dome	1
itself	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
darkness.	1
And	1
far	1
below,	1
lower	1
even	1
than	1
the	1
lights,	1
could	1
be	1
seen	1
creeping	1
or	1
motionless,	1
great	1
black	1
masses	1
of	1
men.	1
The	1
tongue	1
of	1
a	1
terrible	1
organ	1
seemed	1
to	1
shake	1
the	1
very	1
air	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
void;	1
and	1
through	1
it	1
there	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
Michael	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
a	1
tongue	1
more	1
terrible;	1
the	1
dreadful	1
everlasting	1
voice	1
of	1
man,	1
calling	1
to	1
his	1
gods	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
Michael	1
felt	1
almost	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
a	1
god,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
voices	1
were	1
hurled	1
at	1
him.	1
"No,	1
the	1
pretty	1
things	1
aren't	1
here,"	1
said	1
the	1
demi-god	1
in	1
buttons,	1
caressingly.	1
"The	1
pretty	1
things	1
are	1
downstairs.	1
You	1
come	1
along	1
with	1
me.	1
There's	1
something	1
that	1
will	1
surprise	1
you	1
downstairs;	1
something	1
you	1
want	1
very	1
much	1
to	1
see."	1
Evidently	1
the	1
man	1
in	1
buttons	1
did	1
not	1
feel	1
like	1
a	1
god,	1
so	1
Michael	1
made	1
no	1
attempt	1
to	1
explain	1
his	1
feelings	1
to	1
him,	1
but	1
followed	1
him	1
meekly	1
enough	1
down	1
the	1
trail	1
of	1
the	1
serpentine	1
staircase.	1
He	1
had	1
no	1
notion	1
where	1
or	1
at	1
what	1
level	1
he	1
was.	1
He	1
was	1
still	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
cold	1
splendour	1
of	1
space,	1
and	1
of	1
what	1
a	1
French	1
writer	1
has	1
brilliantly	1
named	1
the	1
"vertigo	1
of	1
the	1
infinite,"	1
when	1
another	1
door	1
opened,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
shock	1
indescribable	1
he	1
found	1
himself	1
on	1
the	1
familiar	1
level,	1
in	1
a	1
street	1
full	1
of	1
faces,	1
with	1
the	1
houses	1
and	1
even	1
the	1
lamp-posts	1
above	1
his	1
head.	1
He	1
felt	1
suddenly	1
happy	1
and	1
suddenly	1
indescribably	1
small.	1
He	1
fancied	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
changed	1
into	1
a	1
child	1
again;	1
his	1
eyes	1
sought	1
the	1
pavement	1
seriously	1
as	1
children's	1
do,	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
thing	1
with	1
which	1
something	1
satisfactory	1
could	1
be	1
done.	1
He	1
felt	1
the	1
full	1
warmth	1
of	1
that	1
pleasure	1
from	1
which	1
the	1
proud	1
shut	1
themselves	1
out;	1
the	1
pleasure	1
which	1
not	1
only	1
goes	1
with	1
humiliation,	1
but	1
which	1
almost	1
is	1
humiliation.	1
Men	1
who	1
have	1
escaped	1
death	1
by	1
a	1
hair	1
have	1
it,	1
and	1
men	1
whose	1
love	1
is	1
returned	1
by	1
a	1
woman	1
unexpectedly,	1
and	1
men	1
whose	1
sins	1
are	1
forgiven	1
them.	1
Everything	1
his	1
eye	1
fell	1
on	1
it	1
feasted	1
on,	1
not	1
aesthetically,	1
but	1
with	1
a	1
plain,	1
jolly	1
appetite	1
as	1
of	1
a	1
boy	1
eating	1
buns.	1
He	1
relished	1
the	1
squareness	1
of	1
the	1
houses;	1
he	1
liked	1
their	1
clean	1
angles	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
just	1
cut	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
knife.	1
The	1
lit	1
squares	1
of	1
the	1
shop	1
windows	1
excited	1
him	1
as	1
the	1
young	1
are	1
excited	1
by	1
the	1
lit	1
stage	1
of	1
some	1
promising	1
pantomime.	1
He	1
happened	1
to	1
see	1
in	1
one	1
shop	1
which	1
projected	1
with	1
a	1
bulging	1
bravery	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
pavement	1
some	1
square	1
tins	1
of	1
potted	1
meat,	1
and	1
it	1
seemed	1
like	1
a	1
hint	1
of	1
a	1
hundred	1
hilarious	1
high	1
teas	1
in	1
a	1
hundred	1
streets	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
He	1
was,	1
perhaps,	1
the	1
happiest	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men.	1
For	1
in	1
that	1
unendurable	1
instant	1
when	1
he	1
hung,	1
half	1
slipping,	1
to	1
the	1
ball	1
of	1
St.	1
Paul's,	1
the	1
whole	1
universe	1
had	1
been	1
destroyed	1
and	1
re-created.	1
Suddenly	1
through	1
all	1
the	1
din	1
of	1
the	1
dark	1
streets	1
came	1
a	1
crash	1
of	1
glass.	1
With	1
that	1
mysterious	1
suddenness	1
of	1
the	1
Cockney	1
mob,	1
a	1
rush	1
was	1
made	1
in	1
the	1
right	1
direction,	1
a	1
dingy	1
office,	1
next	1
to	1
the	1
shop	1
of	1
the	1
potted	1
meat.	1
The	1
pane	1
of	1
glass	1
was	1
lying	1
in	1
splinters	1
about	1
the	1
pavement.	1
And	1
the	1
police	1
already	1
had	1
their	1
hands	1
on	1
a	1
very	1
tall	1
young	1
man,	1
with	1
dark,	1
lank	1
hair	1
and	1
dark,	1
dazed	1
eyes,	1
with	1
a	1
grey	1
plaid	1
over	1
his	1
shoulder,	1
who	1
had	1
just	1
smashed	1
the	1
shop	1
window	1
with	1
a	1
single	1
blow	1
of	1
his	1
stick.	1
"I'd	1
do	1
it	1
again,"	1
said	1
the	1
young	1
man,	1
with	1
a	1
furious	1
white	1
face.	1
"Anybody	1
would	1
have	1
done	1
it.	1
Did	1
you	1
see	1
what	1
it	1
said?	1
I	1
swear	1
I'd	1
do	1
it	1
again."	1
Then	1
his	1
eyes	1
encountered	1
the	1
monkish	1
habit	1
of	1
Michael,	1
and	1
he	1
pulled	1
off	1
his	1
grey	1
tam-o'-shanter	1
with	1
the	1
gesture	1
of	1
a	1
Catholic.	1
"Father,	1
did	1
you	1
see	1
what	1
they	1
said?"	1
he	1
cried,	1
trembling.	1
"Did	1
you	1
see	1
what	1
they	1
dared	1
to	1
say?	1
I	1
didn't	1
understand	1
it	1
at	1
first.	1
I	1
read	1
it	1
half	1
through	1
before	1
I	1
broke	1
the	1
window."	1
Michael	1
felt	1
he	1
knew	1
not	1
how.	1
The	1
whole	1
peace	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
was	1
pent	1
up	1
painfully	1
in	1
his	1
heart.	1
The	1
new	1
and	1
childlike	1
world	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
so	1
suddenly,	1
men	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
at	1
all.	1
Here	1
they	1
were	1
still	1
at	1
their	1
old	1
bewildering,	1
pardonable,	1
useless	1
quarrels,	1
with	1
so	1
much	1
to	1
be	1
said	1
on	1
both	1
sides,	1
and	1
so	1
little	1
that	1
need	1
be	1
said	1
at	1
all.	1
A	1
fierce	1
inspiration	1
fell	1
on	1
him	1
suddenly;	1
he	1
would	1
strike	1
them	1
where	1
they	1
stood	1
with	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
God.	1
They	1
should	1
not	1
move	1
till	1
they	1
saw	1
their	1
own	1
sweet	1
and	1
startling	1
existence.	1
They	1
should	1
not	1
go	1
from	1
that	1
place	1
till	1
they	1
went	1
home	1
embracing	1
like	1
brothers	1
and	1
shouting	1
like	1
men	1
delivered.	1
From	1
the	1
Cross	1
from	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
fallen	1
fell	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
its	1
fantastic	1
mercy;	1
and	1
the	1
first	1
three	1
words	1
he	1
spoke	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
like	1
a	1
silver	1
trumpet,	1
held	1
men	1
as	1
still	1
as	1
stones.	1
Perhaps	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
spoken	1
there	1
for	1
an	1
hour	1
in	1
his	1
illumination	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
founded	1
a	1
religion	1
on	1
Ludgate	1
Hill.	1
But	1
the	1
heavy	1
hand	1
of	1
his	1
guide	1
fell	1
suddenly	1
on	1
his	1
shoulder.	1
"This	1
poor	1
fellow	1
is	1
dotty,"	1
he	1
said	1
good-humouredly	1
to	1
the	1
crowd.	1
"I	1
found	1
him	1
wandering	1
in	1
the	1
Cathedral.	1
Says	1
he	1
came	1
in	1
a	1
flying	1
ship.	1
Is	1
there	1
a	1
constable	1
to	1
spare	1
to	1
take	1
care	1
of	1
him?"	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
constable	1
to	1
spare.	1
Two	1
other	1
constables	1
attended	1
to	1
the	1
tall	1
young	1
man	1
in	1
grey;	1
a	1
fourth	1
concerned	1
himself	1
with	1
the	1
owner	1
of	1
the	1
shop,	1
who	1
showed	1
some	1
tendency	1
to	1
be	1
turbulent.	1
They	1
took	1
the	1
tall	1
young	1
man	1
away	1
to	1
a	1
magistrate,	1
whither	1
we	1
shall	1
follow	1
him	1
in	1
an	1
ensuing	1
chapter.	1
And	1
they	1
took	1
the	1
happiest	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
away	1
to	1
an	1
asylum.	1
II.	1
THE	1
RELIGION	1
OF	1
THE	1
STIPENDIARY	1
MAGISTRATE	1
The	1
editorial	1
office	1
of	1
_The	1
Atheist_	1
had	1
for	1
some	1
years	1
past	1
become	1
less	1
and	1
less	1
prominently	1
interesting	1
as	1
a	1
feature	1
of	1
Ludgate	1
Hill.	1
The	1
paper	1
was	1
unsuited	1
to	1
the	1
atmosphere.	1
It	1
showed	1
an	1
interest	1
in	1
the	1
Bible	1
unknown	1
in	1
the	1
district,	1
and	1
a	1
knowledge	1
of	1
that	1
volume	1
to	1
which	1
nobody	1
else	1
on	1
Ludgate	1
Hill	1
could	1
make	1
any	1
conspicuous	1
claim.	1
It	1
was	1
in	1
vain	1
that	1
the	1
editor	1
of	1
_The	1
Atheist_	1
filled	1
his	1
front	1
window	1
with	1
fierce	1
and	1
final	1
demands	1
as	1
to	1
what	1
Noah	1
in	1
the	1
Ark	1
did	1
with	1
the	1
neck	1
of	1
the	1
giraffe.	1
It	1
was	1
in	1
vain	1
that	1
he	1
asked	1
violently,	1
as	1
for	1
the	1
last	1
time,	1
how	1
the	1
statement	1
"God	1
is	1
Spirit"	1
could	1
be	1
reconciled	1
with	1
the	1
statement	1
"The	1
earth	1
is	1
His	1
footstool."	1
It	1
was	1
in	1
vain	1
that	1
he	1
cried	1
with	1
an	1
accusing	1
energy	1
that	1
the	1
Bishop	1
of	1
London	1
was	1
paid	1
L12,000	1
a	1
year	1
for	1
pretending	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
the	1
whale	1
swallowed	1
Jonah.	1
It	1
was	1
in	1
vain	1
that	1
he	1
hung	1
in	1
conspicuous	1
places	1
the	1
most	1
thrilling	1
scientific	1
calculations	1
about	1
the	1
width	1
of	1
the	1
throat	1
of	1
a	1
whale.	1
Was	1
it	1
nothing	1
to	1
them	1
all	1
they	1
that	1
passed	1
by?	1
Did	1
his	1
sudden	1
and	1
splendid	1
and	1
truly	1
sincere	1
indignation	1
never	1
stir	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
pouring	1
down	1
Ludgate	1
Hill?	1
Never.	1
The	1
little	1
man	1
who	1
edited	1
_The	1
Atheist_	1
would	1
rush	1
from	1
his	1
shop	1
on	1
starlit	1
evenings	1
and	1
shake	1
his	1
fist	1
at	1
St.	1
Paul's	1
in	1
the	1
passion	1
of	1
his	1
holy	1
war	1
upon	1
the	1
holy	1
place.	1
He	1
might	1
have	1
spared	1
his	1
emotion.	1
The	1
cross	1
at	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
St.	1
Paul's	1
and	1
_The	1
Atheist_	1
shop	1
at	1
the	1
foot	1
of	1
it	1
were	1
alike	1
remote	1
from	1
the	1
world.	1
The	1
shop	1
and	1
the	1
Cross	1
were	1
equally	1
uplifted	1
and	1
alone	1
in	1
the	1
empty	1
heavens.	1
To	1
the	1
little	1
man	1
who	1
edited	1
_The	1
Atheist_,	1
a	1
fiery	1
little	1
Scotchman,	1
with	1
fiery,	1
red	1
hair	1
and	1
beard,	1
going	1
by	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Turnbull,	1
all	1
this	1
decline	1
in	1
public	1
importance	1
seemed	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
sad	1
or	1
even	1
mad,	1
but	1
merely	1
bewildering	1
and	1
unaccountable.	1
He	1
had	1
said	1
the	1
worst	1
thing	1
that	1
could	1
be	1
said;	1
and	1
it	1
seemed	1
accepted	1
and	1
ignored	1
like	1
the	1
ordinary	1
second	1
best	1
of	1
the	1
politicians.	1
Every	1
day	1
his	1
blasphemies	1
looked	1
more	1
glaring,	1
and	1
every	1
day	1
the	1
dust	1
lay	1
thicker	1
upon	1
them.	1
It	1
made	1
him	1
feel	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
moving	1
in	1
a	1
world	1
of	1
idiots.	1
He	1
seemed	1
among	1
a	1
race	1
of	1
men	1
who	1
smiled	1
when	1
told	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
death,	1
or	1
looked	1
vacantly	1
at	1
the	1
Day	1
of	1
Judgement.	1
Year	1
after	1
year	1
went	1
by,	1
and	1
year	1
after	1
year	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
a	1
shop	1
in	1
Ludgate	1
became	1
a	1
less	1
and	1
less	1
important	1
occurrence.	1
All	1
the	1
forward	1
men	1
of	1
his	1
age	1
discouraged	1
Turnbull.	1
The	1
socialists	1
said	1
he	1
was	1
cursing	1
priests	1
when	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
cursing	1
capitalists.	1
The	1
artists	1
said	1
that	1
the	1
soul	1
was	1
most	1
spiritual,	1
not	1
when	1
freed	1
from	1
religion,	1
but	1
when	1
freed	1
from	1
morality.	1
Year	1
after	1
year	1
went	1
by,	1
and	1
at	1
least	1
a	1
man	1
came	1
by	1
who	1
treated	1
Mr.	1
Turnbull's	1
secularist	1
shop	1
with	1
a	1
real	1
respect	1
and	1
seriousness.	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
in	1
a	1
grey	1
plaid,	1
and	1
he	1
smashed	1
the	1
window.	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
young	1
man,	1
born	1
in	1
the	1
Bay	1
of	1
Arisaig,	1
opposite	1
Rum	1
and	1
the	1
Isle	1
of	1
Skye.	1
His	1
high,	1
hawklike	1
features	1
and	1
snaky	1
black	1
hair	1
bore	1
the	1
mark	1
of	1
that	1
unknown	1
historic	1
thing	1
which	1
is	1
crudely	1
called	1
Celtic,	1
but	1
which	1
is	1
probably	1
far	1
older	1
than	1
the	1
Celts,	1
whoever	1
they	1
were.	1
He	1
was	1
in	1
name	1
and	1
stock	1
a	1
Highlander	1
of	1
the	1
Macdonalds;	1
but	1
his	1
family	1
took,	1
as	1
was	1
common	1
in	1
such	1
cases,	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
a	1
subordinate	1
sept	1
as	1
a	1
surname,	1
and	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
purposes	1
which	1
could	1
be	1
answered	1
in	1
London,	1
he	1
called	1
himself	1
Evan	1
MacIan.	1
He	1
had	1
been	1
brought	1
up	1
in	1
some	1
loneliness	1
and	1
seclusion	1
as	1
a	1
strict	1
Roman	1
Catholic,	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
that	1
little	1
wedge	1
of	1
Roman	1
Catholics	1
which	1
is	1
driven	1
into	1
the	1
Western	1
Highlands.	1
And	1
he	1
had	1
found	1
his	1
way	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
Fleet	1
Street,	1
seeking	1
some	1
half-promised	1
employment,	1
without	1
having	1
properly	1
realized	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
any	1
people	1
who	1
were	1
not	1
Roman	1
Catholics.	1
He	1
had	1
uncovered	1
himself	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
moments	1
before	1
the	1
statue	1
of	1
Queen	1
Anne,	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
St.	1
Paul's	1
Cathedral,	1
under	1
the	1
firm	1
impression	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
figure	1
of	1
the	1
Virgin	1
Mary.	1
He	1
was	1
somewhat	1
surprised	1
at	1
the	1
lack	1
of	1
deference	1
shown	1
to	1
the	1
figure	1
by	1
the	1
people	1
bustling	1
by.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
that	1
their	1
one	1
essential	1
historical	1
principle,	1
the	1
one	1
law	1
truly	1
graven	1
on	1
their	1
hearts,	1
was	1
the	1
great	1
and	1
comforting	1
statement	1
that	1
Queen	1
Anne	1
is	1
dead.	1
This	1
faith	1
was	1
as	1
fundamental	1
as	1
his	1
faith,	1
that	1
Our	1
Lady	1
was	1
alive.	1
Any	1
persons	1
he	1
had	1
talked	1
to	1
since	1
he	1
had	1
touched	1
the	1
fringe	1
of	1
our	1
fashion	1
or	1
civilization	1
had	1
been	1
by	1
a	1
coincidence,	1
sympathetic	1
or	1
hypocritical.	1
Or	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
spoken	1
some	1
established	1
blasphemies,	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
unable	1
to	1
understand	1
them	1
merely	1
owing	1
to	1
the	1
preoccupied	1
satisfaction	1
of	1
his	1
mind.	1
On	1
that	1
fantastic	1
fringe	1
of	1
the	1
Gaelic	1
land	1
where	1
he	1
walked	1
as	1
a	1
boy,	1
the	1
cliffs	1
were	1
as	1
fantastic	1
as	1
the	1
clouds.	1
Heaven	1
seemed	1
to	1
humble	1
itself	1
and	1
come	1
closer	1
to	1
the	1
earth.	1
The	1
common	1
paths	1
of	1
his	1
little	1
village	1
began	1
to	1
climb	1
quite	1
suddenly	1
and	1
seemed	1
resolved	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
heaven.	1
The	1
sky	1
seemed	1
to	1
fall	1
down	1
towards	1
the	1
hills;	1
the	1
hills	1
took	1
hold	1
upon	1
the	1
sky.	1
In	1
the	1
sumptuous	1
sunset	1
of	1
gold	1
and	1
purple	1
and	1
peacock	1
green	1
cloudlets	1
and	1
islets	1
were	1
the	1
same.	1
Evan	1
lived	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
walking	1
on	1
a	1
borderland,	1
the	1
borderland	1
between	1
this	1
world	1
and	1
another.	1
Like	1
so	1
many	1
men	1
and	1
nations	1
who	1
grow	1
up	1
with	1
nature	1
and	1
the	1
common	1
things,	1
he	1
understood	1
the	1
supernatural	1
before	1
he	1
understood	1
the	1
natural.	1
He	1
had	1
looked	1
at	1
dim	1
angels	1
standing	1
knee-deep	1
in	1
the	1
grass	1
before	1
he	1
had	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
grass.	1
He	1
knew	1
that	1
Our	1
Lady's	1
robes	1
were	1
blue	1
before	1
he	1
knew	1
the	1
wild	1
roses	1
round	1
her	1
feet	1
were	1
red.	1
The	1
deeper	1
his	1
memory	1
plunged	1
into	1
the	1
dark	1
house	1
of	1
childhood	1
the	1
nearer	1
and	1
nearer	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
cannot	1
be	1
named.	1
All	1
through	1
his	1
life	1
he	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
daylight	1
world	1
as	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
divine	1
debris,	1
the	1
broken	1
remainder	1
of	1
his	1
first	1
vision.	1
The	1
skies	1
and	1
mountains	1
were	1
the	1
splendid	1
off-scourings	1
of	1
another	1
place.	1
The	1
stars	1
were	1
lost	1
jewels	1
of	1
the	1
Queen.	1
Our	1
Lady	1
had	1
gone	1
and	1
left	1
the	1
stars	1
by	1
accident.	1
His	1
private	1
tradition	1
was	1
equally	1
wild	1
and	1
unworldly.	1
His	1
great-grandfather	1
had	1
been	1
cut	1
down	1
at	1
Culloden,	1
certain	1
in	1
his	1
last	1
instant	1
that	1
God	1
would	1
restore	1
the	1
King.	1
His	1
grandfather,	1
then	1
a	1
boy	1
of	1
ten,	1
had	1
taken	1
the	1
terrible	1
claymore	1
from	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
dead	1
and	1
hung	1
it	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
house,	1
burnishing	1
it	1
and	1
sharpening	1
it	1
for	1
sixty	1
years,	1
to	1
be	1
ready	1
for	1
the	1
next	1
rebellion.	1
His	1
father,	1
the	1
youngest	1
son	1
and	1
the	1
last	1
left	1
alive,	1
had	1
refused	1
to	1
attend	1
on	1
Queen	1
Victoria	1
in	1
Scotland.	1
And	1
Evan	1
himself	1
had	1
been	1
of	1
one	1
piece	1
with	1
his	1
progenitors;	1
and	1
was	1
not	1
dead	1
with	1
them,	1
but	1
alive	1
in	1
the	1
twentieth	1
century.	1
He	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
the	1
pathetic	1
Jacobite	1
of	1
whom	1
we	1
read,	1
left	1
behind	1
by	1
a	1
final	1
advance	1
of	1
all	1
things.	1
He	1
was,	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
fancy,	1
a	1
conspirator,	1
fierce	1
and	1
up	1
to	1
date.	1
In	1
the	1
long,	1
dark	1
afternoons	1
of	1
the	1
Highland	1
winter,	1
he	1
plotted	1
and	1
fumed	1
in	1
the	1
dark.	1
He	1
drew	1
plans	1
of	1
the	1
capture	1
of	1
London	1
on	1
the	1
desolate	1
sand	1
of	1
Arisaig.	1
When	1
he	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
capture	1
London,	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
with	1
an	1
army	1
of	1
white	1
cockades,	1
but	1
with	1
a	1
stick	1
and	1
a	1
satchel.	1
London	1
overawed	1
him	1
a	1
little,	1
not	1
because	1
he	1
thought	1
it	1
grand	1
or	1
even	1
terrible,	1
but	1
because	1
it	1
bewildered	1
him;	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
Golden	1
City	1
or	1
even	1
hell;	1
it	1
was	1
Limbo.	1
He	1
had	1
one	1
shock	1
of	1
sentiment,	1
when	1
he	1
turned	1
that	1
wonderful	1
corner	1
of	1
Fleet	1
Street	1
and	1
saw	1
St.	1
Paul's	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
sky.	1
"Ah,"	1
he	1
said,	1
after	1
a	1
long	1
pause,	1
"that	1
sort	1
of	1
thing	1
was	1
built	1
under	1
the	1
Stuarts!"	1
Then	1
with	1
a	1
sour	1
grin	1
he	1
asked	1
himself	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
corresponding	1
monument	1
of	1
the	1
Brunswicks	1
and	1
the	1
Protestant	1
Constitution.	1
After	1
some	1
warning,	1
he	1
selected	1
a	1
sky-sign	1
of	1
some	1
pill.	1
Half	1
an	1
hour	1
afterwards	1
his	1
emotions	1
left	1
him	1
with	1
an	1
emptied	1
mind	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
spot.	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
mood	1
of	1
mere	1
idle	1
investigation	1
that	1
he	1
happened	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
a	1
standstill	1
opposite	1
the	1
office	1
of	1
_The	1
Atheist_.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
the	1
word	1
"atheist",	1
or	1
if	1
he	1
did,	1
it	1
is	1
quite	1
possible	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
the	1
word.	1
Even	1
as	1
it	1
was,	1
the	1
document	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
shocked	1
even	1
the	1
innocent	1
Highlander,	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
troublesome	1
and	1
quite	1
unforeseen	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
innocent	1
Highlander	1
read	1
it	1
stolidly	1
to	1
the	1
end;	1
a	1
thing	1
unknown	1
among	1
the	1
most	1
enthusiastic	1
subscribers	1
to	1
the	1
paper,	1
and	1
calculated	1
in	1
any	1
case	1
to	1
create	1
a	1
new	1
situation.	1
With	1
a	1
smart	1
journalistic	1
instinct	1
characteristic	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
school,	1
the	1
editor	1
of	1
_The	1
Atheist_	1
had	1
put	1
first	1
in	1
his	1
paper	1
and	1
most	1
prominently	1
in	1
his	1
window	1
an	1
article	1
called	1
"The	1
Mesopotamian	1
Mythology	1
and	1
its	1
Effects	1
on	1
Syriac	1
Folk	1
Lore."	1
Mr.	1
Evan	1
MacIan	1
began	1
to	1
read	1
this	1
quite	1
idly,	1
as	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
read	1
a	1
public	1
statement	1
beginning	1
with	1
a	1
young	1
girl	1
dying	1
in	1
Brighton	1
and	1
ending	1
with	1
Bile	1
Beans.	1
He	1
received	1
the	1
very	1
considerable	1
amount	1
of	1
information	1
accumulated	1
by	1
the	1
author	1
with	1
that	1
tired	1
clearness	1
of	1
the	1
mind	1
which	1
children	1
have	1
on	1
heavy	1
summer	1
afternoons--that	1
tired	1
clearness	1
which	1
leads	1
them	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
asking	1
questions	1
long	1
after	1
they	1
have	1
lost	1
interest	1
in	1
the	1
subject	1
and	1
are	1
as	1
bored	1
as	1
their	1
nurse.	1
The	1
streets	1
were	1
full	1
of	1
people	1
and	1
empty	1
of	1
adventures.	1
He	1
might	1
as	1
well	1
know	1
about	1
the	1
gods	1
of	1
Mesopotamia	1
as	1
not;	1
so	1
he	1
flattened	1
his	1
long,	1
lean	1
face	1
against	1
the	1
dim	1
bleak	1
pane	1
of	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
read	1
all	1
there	1
was	1
to	1
read	1
about	1
Mesopotamian	1
gods.	1
He	1
read	1
how	1
the	1
Mesopotamians	1
had	1
a	1
god	1
named	1
Sho	1
(sometimes	1
pronounced	1
Ji),	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
described	1
as	1
being	1
very	1
powerful,	1
a	1
striking	1
similarity	1
to	1
some	1
expressions	1
about	1
Jahveh,	1
who	1
is	1
also	1
described	1
as	1
having	1
power.	1
Evan	1
had	1
never	1
heard	1
of	1
Jahveh	1
in	1
his	1
life,	1
and	1
imagining	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
some	1
other	1
Mesopotamian	1
idol,	1
read	1
on	1
with	1
a	1
dull	1
curiosity.	1
He	1
learnt	1
that	1
the	1
name	1
Sho,	1
under	1
its	1
third	1
form	1
of	1
Psa,	1
occurs	1
in	1
an	1
early	1
legend	1
which	1
describes	1
how	1
the	1
deity,	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
Jupiter	1
on	1
so	1
many	1
occasions,	1
seduced	1
a	1
Virgin	1
and	1
begat	1
a	1
hero.	1
This	1
hero,	1
whose	1
name	1
is	1
not	1
essential	1
to	1
our	1
existence,	1
was,	1
it	1
was	1
said,	1
the	1
chief	1
hero	1
and	1
Saviour	1
of	1
the	1
Mesopotamian	1
ethical	1
scheme.	1
Then	1
followed	1
a	1
paragraph	1
giving	1
other	1
examples	1
of	1
such	1
heroes	1
and	1
Saviours	1
being	1
born	1
of	1
some	1
profligate	1
intercourse	1
between	1
God	1
and	1
mortal.	1
Then	1
followed	1
a	1
paragraph--but	1
Evan	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
it.	1
He	1
read	1
it	1
again	1
and	1
then	1
again.	1
Then	1
he	1
did	1
understand	1
it.	1
The	1
glass	1
fell	1
in	1
ringing	1
fragments	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
pavement,	1
and	1
Evan	1
sprang	1
over	1
the	1
barrier	1
into	1
the	1
shop,	1
brandishing	1
his	1
stick.	1
"What	1
is	1
this?"	1
cried	1
little	1
Mr.	1
Turnbull,	1
starting	1
up	1
with	1
hair	1
aflame.	1
"How	1
dare	1
you	1
break	1
my	1
window?"	1
"Because	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
quickest	1
cut	1
to	1
you,"	1
cried	1
Evan,	1
stamping.	1
"Stand	1
up	1
and	1
fight,	1
you	1
crapulous	1
coward.	1
You	1
dirty	1
lunatic,	1
stand	1
up,	1
will	1
you?	1
Have	1
you	1
any	1
weapons	1
here?"	1
"Are	1
you	1
mad?"	1
asked	1
Turnbull,	1
glaring.	1
"Are	1
you?"	1
cried	1
Evan.	1
"Can	1
you	1
be	1
anything	1
else	1
when	1
you	1
plaster	1
your	1
own	1
house	1
with	1
that	1
God-defying	1
filth?	1
Stand	1
up	1
and	1
fight,	1
I	1
say."	1
A	1
great	1
light	1
like	1
dawn	1
came	1
into	1
Mr.	1
Turnbull's	1
face.	1
Behind	1
his	1
red	1
hair	1
and	1
beard	1
he	1
turned	1
deadly	1
pale	1
with	1
pleasure.	1
Here,	1
after	1
twenty	1
lone	1
years	1
of	1
useless	1
toil,	1
he	1
had	1
his	1
reward.	1
Someone	1
was	1
angry	1
with	1
the	1
paper.	1
He	1
bounded	1
to	1
his	1
feet	1
like	1
a	1
boy;	1
he	1
saw	1
a	1
new	1
youth	1
opening	1
before	1
him.	1
And	1
as	1
not	1
unfrequently	1
happens	1
to	1
middle-aged	1
gentlemen	1
when	1
they	1
see	1
a	1
new	1
youth	1
opening	1
before	1
them,	1
he	1
found	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
police.	1
The	1
policemen,	1
after	1
some	1
ponderous	1
questionings,	1
collared	1
both	1
the	1
two	1
enthusiasts.	1
They	1
were	1
more	1
respectful,	1
however,	1
to	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
smashed	1
the	1
window,	1
than	1
to	1
the	1
miscreant	1
who	1
had	1
had	1
his	1
window	1
smashed.	1
There	1
was	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
refined	1
mystery	1
about	1
Evan	1
MacIan,	1
which	1
did	1
not	1
exist	1
in	1
the	1
irate	1
little	1
shopkeeper,	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
refined	1
mystery	1
which	1
appealed	1
to	1
the	1
policemen,	1
for	1
policemen,	1
like	1
most	1
other	1
English	1
types,	1
are	1
at	1
once	1
snobs	1
and	1
poets.	1
MacIan	1
might	1
possibly	1
be	1
a	1
gentleman,	1
they	1
felt;	1
the	1
editor	1
manifestly	1
was	1
not.	1
And	1
the	1
editor's	1
fine	1
rational	1
republican	1
appeals	1
to	1
his	1
respect	1
for	1
law,	1
and	1
his	1
ardour	1
to	1
be	1
tried	1
by	1
his	1
fellow	1
citizens,	1
seemed	1
to	1
the	1
police	1
quite	1
as	1
much	1
gibberish	1
as	1
Evan's	1
mysticism	1
could	1
have	1
done.	1
The	1
police	1
were	1
not	1
used	1
to	1
hearing	1
principles,	1
even	1
the	1
principles	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
existence.	1
The	1
police	1
magistrate,	1
before	1
whom	1
they	1
were	1
hurried	1
and	1
tried,	1
was	1
a	1
Mr.	1
Cumberland	1
Vane,	1
a	1
cheerful,	1
middle-aged	1
gentleman,	1
honourably	1
celebrated	1
for	1
the	1
lightness	1
of	1
his	1
sentences	1
and	1
the	1
lightness	1
of	1
his	1
conversation.	1
He	1
occasionally	1
worked	1
himself	1
up	1
into	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
theoretic	1
rage	1
about	1
certain	1
particular	1
offenders,	1
such	1
as	1
the	1
men	1
who	1
took	1
pokers	1
to	1
their	1
wives,	1
talked	1
in	1
a	1
loose,	1
sentimental	1
way	1
about	1
the	1
desirability	1
of	1
flogging	1
them,	1
and	1
was	1
hopelessly	1
bewildered	1
by	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
wives	1
seemed	1
even	1
more	1
angry	1
with	1
him	1
than	1
with	1
their	1
husbands.	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
tall,	1
spruce	1
man,	1
with	1
a	1
twist	1
of	1
black	1
moustache	1
and	1
incomparable	1
morning	1
dress.	1
He	1
looked	1
like	1
a	1
gentleman,	1
and	1
yet,	1
somehow,	1
like	1
a	1
stage	1
gentleman.	1
He	1
had	1
often	1
treated	1
serious	1
crimes	1
against	1
mere	1
order	1
or	1
property	1
with	1
a	1
humane	1
flippancy.	1
Hence,	1
about	1
the	1
mere	1
breaking	1
of	1
an	1
editor's	1
window,	1
he	1
was	1
almost	1
uproarious.	1
"Come,	1
Mr.	1
MacIan,	1
come,"	1
he	1
said,	1
leaning	1
back	1
in	1
his	1
chair,	1
"do	1
you	1
generally	1
enter	1
you	1
friends'	1
houses	1
by	1
walking	1
through	1
the	1
glass?"	1
(Laughter.)	1
"He	1
is	1
not	1
my	1
friend,"	1
said	1
Evan,	1
with	1
the	1
stolidity	1
of	1
a	1
dull	1
child.	1
"Not	1
your	1
friend,	1
eh?"	1
said	1
the	1
magistrate,	1
sparkling.	1
"Is	1
he	1
your	1
brother-in-law?"	1
(Loud	1
and	1
prolonged	1
laughter.)	1
"He	1
is	1
my	1
enemy,"	1
said	1
Evan,	1
simply;	1
"he	1
is	1
the	1
enemy	1
of	1
God."	1
Mr.	1
Vane	1
shifted	1
sharply	1
in	1
his	1
seat,	1
dropping	1
the	1
eye-glass	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
eye	1
in	1
a	1
momentary	1
and	1
not	1
unmanly	1
embarrassment.	1
"You	1
mustn't	1
talk	1
like	1
that	1
here,"	1
he	1
said,	1
roughly,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
hurry,	1
"that	1
has	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
us."	1
Evan	1
opened	1
his	1
great,	1
blue	1
eyes;	1
"God,"	1
he	1
began.	1
"Be	1
quiet,"	1
said	1
the	1
magistrate,	1
angrily,	1
"it	1
is	1
most	1
undesirable	1
that	1
things	1
of	1
that	1
sort	1
should	1
be	1
spoken	1
about--a--in	1
public,	1
and	1
in	1
an	1
ordinary	1
Court	1
of	1
Justice.	1
Religion	1
is--a--too	1
personal	1
a	1
matter	1
to	1
be	1
mentioned	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
place."	1
"Is	1
it?"	1
answered	1
the	1
Highlander,	1
"then	1
what	1
did	1
those	1
policemen	1
swear	1
by	1
just	1
now?"	1
"That	1
is	1
no	1
parallel,"	1
answered	1
Vane,	1
rather	1
irritably;	1
"of	1
course	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
form	1
of	1
oath--to	1
be	1
taken	1
reverently--	1
reverently,	1
and	1
there's	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
it.	1
But	1
to	1
talk	1
in	1
a	1
public	1
place	1
about	1
one's	1
most	1
sacred	1
and	1
private	1
sentiments--well,	1
I	1
call	1
it	1
bad	1
taste.	1
(Slight	1
applause.)	1
I	1
call	1
it	1
irreverent.	1
I	1
call	1
it	1
irreverent,	1
and	1
I'm	1
not	1
specially	1
orthodox	1
either."	1
"I	1
see	1
you	1
are	1
not,"	1
said	1
Evan,	1
"but	1
I	1
am."	1
"We	1
are	1
wondering	1
from	1
the	1
point,"	1
said	1
the	1
police	1
magistrate,	1
pulling	1
himself	1
together.	1
"May	1
I	1
ask	1
why	1
you	1
smashed	1
this	1
worthy	1
citizen's	1
window?"	1
Evan	1
turned	1
a	1
little	1
pale	1
at	1
the	1
mere	1
memory,	1
but	1
he	1
answered	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
cold	1
and	1
deadly	1
literalism	1
that	1
he	1
showed	1
throughout.	1
"Because	1
he	1
blasphemed	1
Our	1
Lady."	1
"I	1
tell	1
you	1
once	1
and	1
for	1
all,"	1
cried	1
Mr.	1
Cumberland	1
Vane,	1
rapping	1
his	1
knuckles	1
angrily	1
on	1
the	1
table,	1
"I	1
tell	1
you,	1
once	1
and	1
for	1
all,	1
my	1
man,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
have	1
you	1
turning	1
on	1
any	1
religious	1
rant	1
or	1
cant	1
here.	1
Don't	1
imagine	1
that	1
it	1
will	1
impress	1
me.	1
The	1
most	1
religious	1
people	1
are	1
not	1
those	1
who	1
talk	1
about	1
it.	1
(Applause.)	1
You	1
answer	1
the	1
questions	1
and	1
do	1
nothing	1
else."	1
"I	1
did	1
nothing	1
else,"	1
said	1
Evan,	1
with	1
a	1
slight	1
smile.	1
"Eh,"	1
cried	1
Vane,	1
glaring	1
through	1
his	1
eye-glass.	1
"You	1
asked	1
me	1
why	1
I	1
broke	1
his	1
window,"	1
said	1
MacIan,	1
with	1
a	1
face	1
of	1
wood.	1
"I	1
answered,	1
'Because	1
he	1
blasphemed	1
Our	1
Lady.'	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
other	1
reason.	1
So	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
other	1
answer."	1
Vane	1
continued	1
to	1
gaze	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
sternness	1
not	1
habitual	1
to	1
him.	1
"You	1
are	1
not	1
going	1
the	1
right	1
way	1
to	1
work,	1
Sir,"	1
he	1
said,	1
with	1
severity.	1
"You	1
are	1
not	1
going	1
the	1
right	1
way	1
to	1
work	1
to--a--have	1
your	1
case	1
treated	1
with	1
special	1
consideration.	1
If	1
you	1
had	1
simply	1
expressed	1
regret	1
for	1
what	1
you	1
had	1
done,	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
strongly	1
inclined	1
to	1
dismiss	1
the	1
matter	1
as	1
an	1
outbreak	1
of	1
temper.	1
Even	1
now,	1
if	1
you	1
say	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
sorry	1
I	1
shall	1
only----"	1
"But	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
sorry,"	1
said	1
Evan,	1
"I	1
am	1
very	1
pleased."	1
"I	1
really	1
believe	1
you	1
are	1
insane,"	1
said	1
the	1
stipendiary,	1
indignantly,	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
really	1
been	1
doing	1
his	1
best	1
as	1
a	1
good-natured	1
man,	1
to	1
compose	1
the	1
dispute.	1
"What	1
conceivable	1
right	1
have	1
you	1
to	1
break	1
other	1
people's	1
windows	1
because	1
their	1
opinions	1
do	1
not	1
agree	1
with	1
yours?	1
This	1
man	1
only	1
gave	1
expression	1
to	1
his	1
sincere	1
belief."	1
"So	1
did	1
I,"	1
said	1
the	1
Highlander.	1
"And	1
who	1
are	1
you?"	1
exploded	1
Vane.	1
"Are	1
your	1
views	1
necessarily	1
the	1
right	1
ones?	1
Are	1
you	1
necessarily	1
in	1
possession	1
of	1
the	1
truth?"	1
"Yes,"	1
said	1
MacIan.	1
The	1
magistrate	1
broke	1
into	1
a	1
contemptuous	1
laugh.	1
"Oh,	1
you	1
want	1
a	1
nurse	1
to	1
look	1
after	1
you,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"You	1
must	1
pay	1
L10."	1
Evan	1
MacIan	1
plunged	1
his	1
hands	1
into	1
his	1
loose	1
grey	1
garment	1
and	1
drew	1
out	1
a	1
queer	1
looking	1
leather	1
purse.	1
It	1
contained	1
exactly	1
twelve	1
sovereigns.	1
He	1
paid	1
down	1
the	1
ten,	1
coin	1
by	1
coin,	1
in	1
silence,	1
and	1
equally	1
silently	1
returned	1
the	1
remaining	1
two	1
to	1
the	1
receptacle.	1
Then	1
he	1
said,	1
"May	1
I	1
say	1
a	1
word,	1
your	1
worship?"	1
Cumberland	1
Vane	1
seemed	1
half	1
hypnotized	1
with	1
the	1
silence	1
and	1
automatic	1
movements	1
of	1
the	1
stranger;	1
he	1
made	1
a	1
movement	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
which	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
either	1
"yes"	1
or	1
"no".	1
"I	1
only	1
wished	1
to	1
say,	1
your	1
worship,"	1
said	1
MacIan,	1
putting	1
back	1
the	1
purse	1
in	1
his	1
trouser	1
pocket,	1
"that	1
smashing	1
that	1
shop	1
window	1
was,	1
I	1
confess,	1
a	1
useless	1
and	1
rather	1
irregular	1
business.	1
It	1
may	1
be	1
excused,	1
however,	1
as	1
a	1
mere	1
preliminary	1
to	1
further	1
proceedings,	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
preface.	1
Wherever	1
and	1
whenever	1
I	1
meet	1
that	1
man,"	1
and	1
he	1
pointed	1
to	1
the	1
editor	1
of	1
_The	1
Atheist_,	1
"whether	1
it	1
be	1
outside	1
this	1
door	1
in	1
ten	1
minutes	1
from	1
now,	1
or	1
twenty	1
years	1
hence	1
in	1
some	1
distant	1
country,	1
wherever	1
and	1
whenever	1
I	1
meet	1
that	1
man,	1
I	1
will	1
fight	1
him.	1
Do	1
not	1
be	1
afraid.	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
rush	1
at	1
him	1
like	1
a	1
bully,	1
or	1
bear	1
him	1
down	1
with	1
any	1
brute	1
superiority.	1
I	1
will	1
fight	1
him	1
like	1
a	1
gentleman;	1
I	1
will	1
fight	1
him	1
as	1
our	1
fathers	1
fought.	1
He	1
shall	1
choose	1
how,	1
sword	1
or	1
pistol,	1
horse	1
or	1
foot.	1
But	1
if	1
he	1
refuses,	1
I	1
will	1
write	1
his	1
cowardice	1
on	1
every	1
wall	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
If	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
of	1
my	1
mother	1
what	1
he	1
said	1
of	1
the	1
Mother	1
of	1
God,	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
club	1
of	1
clean	1
men	1
in	1
Europe	1
that	1
would	1
deny	1
my	1
right	1
to	1
call	1
him	1
out.	1
If	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
it	1
of	1
my	1
wife,	1
you	1
English	1
would	1
yourselves	1
have	1
pardoned	1
me	1
for	1
beating	1
him	1
like	1
a	1
dog	1
in	1
the	1
market	1
place.	1
Your	1
worship,	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
mother;	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
wife.	1
I	1
have	1
only	1
that	1
which	1
the	1
poor	1
have	1
equally	1
with	1
the	1
rich;	1
which	1
the	1
lonely	1
have	1
equally	1
with	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
many	1
friends.	1
To	1
me	1
this	1
whole	1
strange	1
world	1
is	1
homely,	1
because	1
in	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
it	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
home;	1
to	1
me	1
this	1
cruel	1
world	1
is	1
kindly,	1
because	1
higher	1
than	1
the	1
heavens	1
there	1
is	1
something	1
more	1
human	1
than	1
humanity.	1
If	1
a	1
man	1
must	1
not	1
fight	1
for	1
this,	1
may	1
he	1
fight	1
for	1
anything?	1
I	1
would	1
fight	1
for	1
my	1
friend,	1
but	1
if	1
I	1
lost	1
my	1
friend,	1
I	1
should	1
still	1
be	1
there.	1
I	1
would	1
fight	1
for	1
my	1
country,	1
but	1
if	1
I	1
lost	1
my	1
country,	1
I	1
should	1
still	1
exist.	1
But	1
if	1
what	1
that	1
devil	1
dreams	1
were	1
true,	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
be--I	1
should	1
burst	1
like	1
a	1
bubble	1
and	1
be	1
gone.	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
live	1
in	1
that	1
imbecile	1
universe.	1
Shall	1
I	1
not	1
fight	1
for	1
my	1
own	1
existence?"	1
The	1
magistrate	1
recovered	1
his	1
voice	1
and	1
his	1
presence	1
of	1
mind.	1
The	1
first	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
speech,	1
the	1
bombastic	1
and	1
brutally	1
practical	1
challenge,	1
stunned	1
him	1
with	1
surprise;	1
but	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
Evan's	1
remarks,	1
branching	1
off	1
as	1
they	1
did	1
into	1
theoretic	1
phrases,	1
gave	1
his	1
vague	1
and	1
very	1
English	1
mind	1
(full	1
of	1
memories	1
of	1
the	1
hedging	1
and	1
compromise	1
in	1
English	1
public	1
speaking)	1
an	1
indistinct	1
sensation	1
of	1
relief,	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
man,	1
though	1
mad,	1
were	1
not	1
so	1
dangerous	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
thought.	1
He	1
went	1
into	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
weary	1
laughter.	1
"For	1
Heaven's	1
sake,	1
man,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"don't	1
talk	1
so	1
much.	1
Let	1
other	1
people	1
have	1
a	1
chance	1
(laughter).	1
I	1
trust	1
all	1
that	1
you	1
said	1
about	1
asking	1
Mr.	1
Turnbull	1
to	1
fight,	1
may	1
be	1
regarded	1
as	1
rubbish.	1
In	1
case	1
of	1
accidents,	1
however,	1
I	1
must	1
bind	1
you	1
over	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
peace."	1
"To	1
keep	1
the	1
peace,"	1
repeated	1
Evan,	1
"with	1
whom?"	1
"With	1
Mr.	1
Turnbull,"	1
said	1
Vane.	1
"Certainly	1
not,"	1
answered	1
MacIan.	1
"What	1
has	1
he	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
peace?"	1
"Do	1
you	1
mean	1
to	1
say,"	1
began	1
the	1
magistrate,	1
"that	1
you	1
refuse	1
to..."	1
The	1
voice	1
of	1
Turnbull	1
himself	1
clove	1
in	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time.	1
"Might	1
I	1
suggest,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"That	1
I,	1
your	1
worship,	1
can	1
settle	1
to	1
some	1
extent	1
this	1
absurd	1
matter	1
myself.	1
This	1
rather	1
wild	1
gentleman	1
promises	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
attack	1
me	1
with	1
any	1
ordinary	1
assault--	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
does,	1
you	1
may	1
be	1
sure	1
the	1
police	1
shall	1
hear	1
of	1
it.	1
But	1
he	1
says	1
he	1
will	1
not.	1
He	1
says	1
he	1
will	1
challenge	1
me	1
to	1
a	1
duel;	1
and	1
I	1
cannot	1
say	1
anything	1
stronger	1
about	1
his	1
mental	1
state	1
than	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
highly	1
probable	1
that	1
he	1
will.	1
(Laughter.)	1
But	1
it	1
takes	1
two	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
duel,	1
your	1
worship	1
(renewed	1
laughter).	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
mind	1
being	1
described	1
on	1
every	1
wall	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
as	1
the	1
coward	1
who	1
would	1
not	1
fight	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
Fleet	1
Street,	1
about	1
whether	1
the	1
Virgin	1
Mary	1
had	1
a	1
parallel	1
in	1
Mesopotamian	1
mythology.	1
No,	1
your	1
worship.	1
You	1
need	1
not	1
trouble	1
to	1
bind	1
him	1
over	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
peace.	1
I	1
bind	1
myself	1
over	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
peace,	1
and	1
you	1
may	1
rest	1
quite	1
satisfied	1
that	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
no	1
duel	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
it."	1
Mr.	1
Cumberland	1
Vane	1
rolled	1
about,	1
laughing	1
in	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
relief.	1
"You're	1
like	1
a	1
breath	1
of	1
April,	1
sir,"	1
he	1
cried.	1
"You're	1
ozone	1
after	1
that	1
fellow.	1
You're	1
perfectly	1
right.	1
Perhaps	1
I	1
have	1
taken	1
the	1
thing	1
too	1
seriously.	1
I	1
should	1
love	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
sending	1
you	1
challenges	1
and	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
smiling.	1
Well,	1
well."	1
Evan	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
Court	1
of	1
Justice	1
free,	1
but	1
strangely	1
shaken,	1
like	1
a	1
sick	1
man.	1
Any	1
punishment	1
of	1
suppression	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
felt	1
as	1
natural;	1
but	1
the	1
sudden	1
juncture	1
between	1
the	1
laughter	1
of	1
his	1
judge	1
and	1
the	1
laughter	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
he	1
had	1
wronged,	1
made	1
him	1
feel	1
suddenly	1
small,	1
or	1
at	1
least,	1
defeated.	1
It	1
was	1
really	1
true	1
that	1
the	1
whole	1
modern	1
world	1
regarded	1
his	1
world	1
as	1
a	1
bubble.	1
No	1
cruelty	1
could	1
have	1
shown	1
it,	1
but	1
their	1
kindness	1
showed	1
it	1
with	1
a	1
ghastly	1
clearness.	1
As	1
he	1
was	1
brooding,	1
he	1
suddenly	1
became	1
conscious	1
of	1
a	1
small,	1
stern	1
figure,	1
fronting	1
him	1
in	1
silence.	1
Its	1
eyes	1
were	1
grey	1
and	1
awful,	1
and	1
its	1
beard	1
red.	1
It	1
was	1
Turnbull.	1
"Well,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
the	1
editor	1
of	1
_The	1
Atheist_,	1
"where	1
is	1
the	1
fight	1
to	1
be?	1
Name	1
the	1
field,	1
sir."	1
Evan	1
stood	1
thunderstruck.	1
He	1
stammered	1
out	1
something,	1
he	1
knew	1
not	1
what;	1
he	1
only	1
guessed	1
it	1
by	1
the	1
answer	1
of	1
the	1
other.	1
"Do	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
fight?	1
Do	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
fight?"	1
cried	1
the	1
furious	1
Free-thinker.	1
"Why,	1
you	1
moonstruck	1
scarecrow	1
of	1
superstition,	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
your	1
dirty	1
saints	1
are	1
the	1
only	1
people	1
who	1
can	1
die?	1
Haven't	1
you	1
hung	1
atheists,	1
and	1
burned	1
them,	1
and	1
boiled	1
them,	1
and	1
did	1
they	1
ever	1
deny	1
their	1
faith?	1
Do	1
you	1
think	1
we	1
don't	1
want	1
to	1
fight?	1
Night	1
and	1
day	1
I	1
have	1
prayed--I	1
have	1
longed--for	1
an	1
atheist	1
revolution--I	1
have	1
longed	1
to	1
see	1
your	1
blood	1
and	1
ours	1
on	1
the	1
streets.	1
Let	1
it	1
be	1
yours	1
or	1
mine?"	1
"But	1
you	1
said..."	1
began	1
MacIan.	1
"I	1
know,"	1
said	1
Turnbull	1
scornfully.	1
"And	1
what	1
did	1
you	1
say?	1
You	1
damned	1
fool,	1
you	1
said	1
things	1
that	1
might	1
have	1
got	1
us	1
locked	1
up	1
for	1
a	1
year,	1
and	1
shadowed	1
by	1
the	1
coppers	1
for	1
half	1
a	1
decade.	1
If	1
you	1
wanted	1
to	1
fight,	1
why	1
did	1
you	1
tell	1
that	1
ass	1
you	1
wanted	1
to?	1
I	1
got	1
you	1
out,	1
to	1
fight	1
if	1
you	1
want	1
to.	1
Now,	1
fight	1
if	1
you	1
dare."	1
"I	1
swear	1
to	1
you,	1
then,"	1
said	1
MacIan,	1
after	1
a	1
pause.	1
"I	1
swear	1
to	1
you	1
that	1
nothing	1
shall	1
come	1
between	1
us.	1
I	1
swear	1
to	1
you	1
that	1
nothing	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
my	1
heart	1
or	1
in	1
my	1
head	1
till	1
our	1
swords	1
clash	1
together.	1
I	1
swear	1
it	1
by	1
the	1
God	1
you	1
have	1
denied,	1
by	1
the	1
Blessed	1
Lady	1
you	1
have	1
blasphemed;	1
I	1
swear	1
it	1
by	1
the	1
seven	1
swords	1
in	1
her	1
heart.	1
I	1
swear	1
it	1
by	1
the	1
Holy	1
Island	1
where	1
my	1
fathers	1
are,	1
by	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
my	1
mother,	1
by	1
the	1
secret	1
of	1
my	1
people,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
chalice	1
of	1
the	1
Blood	1
of	1
God."	1
The	1
atheist	1
drew	1
up	1
his	1
head.	1
"And	1
I,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"give	1
my	1
word."	1
III.	1
SOME	1
OLD	1
CURIOSITIES	1
The	1
evening	1
sky,	1
a	1
dome	1
of	1
solid	1
gold,	1
unflaked	1
even	1
by	1
a	1
single	1
sunset	1
cloud,	1
steeped	1
the	1
meanest	1
sights	1
of	1
London	1
in	1
a	1
strange	1
and	1
mellow	1
light.	1
It	1
made	1
a	1
little	1
greasy	1
street	1
of	1
St.	1
Martin's	1
Lane	1
look	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
paved	1
with	1
gold.	1
It	1
made	1
the	1
pawnbroker's	1
half-way	1
down	1
it	1
shine	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
really	1
that	1
Mountain	1
of	1
Piety	1
that	1
the	1
French	1
poetic	1
instinct	1
has	1
named	1
it;	1
it	1
made	1
the	1
mean	1
pseudo-French	1
bookshop,	1
next	1
but	1
one	1
to	1
it,	1
a	1
shop	1
packed	1
with	1
dreary	1
indecency,	1
show	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
Parisian	1
colour.	1
And	1
the	1
shop	1
that	1
stood	1
between	1
the	1
pawnshop	1
and	1
the	1
shop	1
of	1
dreary	1
indecency,	1
showed	1
with	1
quite	1
a	1
blaze	1
of	1
old	1
world	1
beauty,	1
for	1
it	1
was,	1
by	1
accident,	1
a	1
shop	1
not	1
unbeautiful	1
in	1
itself.	1
The	1
front	1
window	1
had	1
a	1
glimmer	1
of	1
bronze	1
and	1
blue	1
steel,	1
lit,	1
as	1
by	1
a	1
few	1
stars,	1
by	1
the	1
sparks	1
of	1
what	1
were	1
alleged	1
to	1
be	1
jewels;	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
brief,	1
a	1
shop	1
of	1
bric-a-brac	1
and	1
old	1
curiosities.	1
A	1
row	1
of	1
half-burnished	1
seventeenth-century	1
swords	1
ran	1
like	1
an	1
ornate	1
railing	1
along	1
the	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
window;	1
behind	1
was	1
a	1
darker	1
glimmer	1
of	1
old	1
oak	1
and	1
old	1
armour;	1
and	1
higher	1
up	1
hung	1
the	1
most	1
extraordinary	1
looking	1
South	1
Sea	1
tools	1
or	1
utensils,	1
whether	1
designed	1
for	1
killing	1
enemies	1
or	1
merely	1
for	1
cooking	1
them,	1
no	1
mere	1
white	1
man	1
could	1
possibly	1
conjecture.	1
But	1
the	1
romance	1
of	1
the	1
eye,	1
which	1
really	1
on	1
this	1
rich	1
evening,	1
clung	1
about	1
the	1
shop,	1
had	1
its	1
main	1
source	1
in	1
the	1
accident	1
of	1
two	1
doors	1
standing	1
open,	1
the	1
front	1
door	1
that	1
opened	1
on	1
the	1
street	1
and	1
a	1
back	1
door	1
that	1
opened	1
on	1
an	1
odd	1
green	1
square	1
of	1
garden,	1
that	1
the	1
sun	1
turned	1
to	1
a	1
square	1
of	1
gold.	1
There	1
is	1
nothing	1
more	1
beautiful	1
than	1
thus	1
to	1
look	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
through	1
the	1
archway	1
of	1
a	1
house;	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
open	1
sky	1
were	1
an	1
interior	1
chamber,	1
and	1
the	1
sun	1
a	1
secret	1
lamp	1
of	1
the	1
place.	1
I	1
have	1
suggested	1
that	1
the	1
sunset	1
light	1
made	1
everything	1
lovely.	1
To	1
say	1
that	1
it	1
made	1
the	1
keeper	1
of	1
the	1
curiosity	1
shop	1
lovely	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
tribute	1
to	1
it	1
perhaps	1
too	1
extreme.	1
It	1
would	1
easily	1
have	1
made	1
him	1
beautiful	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
merely	1
squalid;	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
Jew	1
of	1
the	1
Fagin	1
type.	1
But	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
Jew	1
of	1
another	1
and	1
much	1
less	1
admirable	1
type;	1
a	1
Jew	1
with	1
a	1
very	1
well-sounding	1
name.	1
For	1
though	1
there	1
are	1
no	1
hard	1
tests	1
for	1
separating	1
the	1
tares	1
and	1
the	1
wheat	1
of	1
any	1
people,	1
one	1
rude	1
but	1
efficient	1
guide	1
is	1
that	1
the	1
nice	1
Jew	1
is	1
called	1
Moses	1
Solomon,	1
and	1
the	1
nasty	1
Jew	1
is	1
called	1
Thornton	1
Percy.	1
The	1
keeper	1
of	1
the	1
curiosity	1
shop	1
was	1
of	1
the	1
Thornton	1
Percy	1
branch	1
of	1
the	1
chosen	1
people;	1
he	1
belonged	1
to	1
those	1
Lost	1
Ten	1
Tribes	1
whose	1
industrious	1
object	1
is	1
to	1
lose	1
themselves.	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
still	1
young,	1
but	1
already	1
corpulent,	1
with	1
sleek	1
dark	1
hair,	1
heavy	1
handsome	1
clothes,	1
and	1
a	1
full,	1
fat,	1
permanent	1
smile,	1
which	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
glance	1
kindly,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
second	1
cowardly.	1
The	1
name	1
over	1
his	1
shop	1
was	1
Henry	1
Gordon,	1
but	1
two	1
Scotchmen	1
who	1
were	1
in	1
his	1
shop	1
that	1
evening	1
could	1
come	1
upon	1
no	1
trace	1
of	1
a	1
Scotch	1
accent.	1
These	1
two	1
Scotchmen	1
in	1
this	1
shop	1
were	1
careful	1
purchasers,	1
but	1
free-handed	1
payers.	1
One	1
of	1
them	1
who	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
principal	1
and	1
the	1
authority	1
(whom,	1
indeed,	1
Mr.	1
Henry	1
Gordon	1
fancied	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
somewhere	1
before),	1
was	1
a	1
small,	1
sturdy	1
fellow,	1
with	1
fine	1
grey	1
eyes,	1
a	1
square	1
red	1
tie	1
and	1
a	1
square	1
red	1
beard,	1
that	1
he	1
carried	1
aggressively	1
forward	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
defied	1
anyone	1
to	1
pull	1
it.	1
The	1
other	1
kept	1
so	1
much	1
in	1
the	1
background	1
in	1
comparison	1
that	1
he	1
looked	1
almost	1
ghostly	1
in	1
his	1
grey	1
cloak	1
or	1
plaid,	1
a	1
tall,	1
sallow,	1
silent	1
young	1
man.	1
The	1
two	1
Scotchmen	1
were	1
interested	1
in	1
seventeenth-century	1
swords.	1
They	1
were	1
fastidious	1
about	1
them.	1
They	1
had	1
a	1
whole	1
armoury	1
of	1
these	1
weapons	1
brought	1
out	1
and	1
rolled	1
clattering	1
about	1
the	1
counter,	1
until	1
they	1
found	1
two	1
of	1
precisely	1
the	1
same	1
length.	1
Presumably	1
they	1
desired	1
the	1
exact	1
symmetry	1
for	1
some	1
decorative	1
trophy.	1
Even	1
then	1
they	1
felt	1
the	1
points,	1
poised	1
the	1
swords	1
for	1
balance	1
and	1
bent	1
them	1
in	1
a	1
circle	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
they	1
sprang	1
straight	1
again;	1
which,	1
for	1
decorative	1
purposes,	1
seems	1
carrying	1
realism	1
rather	1
far.	1
"These	1
will	1
do,"	1
said	1
the	1
strange	1
person	1
with	1
the	1
red	1
beard.	1
"And	1
perhaps	1
I	1
had	1
better	1
pay	1
for	1
them	1
at	1
once.	1
And	1
as	1
you	1
are	1
the	1
challenger,	1
Mr.	1
MacIan,	1
perhaps	1
you	1
had	1
better	1
explain	1
the	1
situation."	1
The	1
tall	1
Scotchman	1
in	1
grey	1
took	1
a	1
step	1
forward	1
and	1
spoke	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
quite	1
clear	1
and	1
bold,	1
and	1
yet	1
somehow	1
lifeless,	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
going	1
through	1
an	1
ancient	1
formality.	1
"The	1
fact	1
is,	1
Mr.	1
Gordon,	1
we	1
have	1
to	1
place	1
our	1
honour	1
in	1
your	1
hands.	1
Words	1
have	1
passed	1
between	1
Mr.	1
Turnbull	1
and	1
myself	1
on	1
a	1
grave	1
and	1
invaluable	1
matter,	1
which	1
can	1
only	1
be	1
atoned	1
for	1
by	1
fighting.	1
Unfortunately,	1
as	1
the	1
police	1
are	1
in	1
some	1
sense	1
pursuing	1
us,	1
we	1
are	1
hurried,	1
and	1
must	1
fight	1
now	1
and	1
without	1
seconds.	1
But	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
so	1
kind	1
as	1
to	1
take	1
us	1
into	1
your	1
little	1
garden	1
and	1
see	1
far	1
play,	1
we	1
shall	1
feel	1
how----"	1
The	1
shopman	1
recovered	1
himself	1
from	1
a	1
stunning	1
surprise	1
and	1
burst	1
out:	1
"Gentlemen,	1
are	1
you	1
drunk?	1
A	1
duel!	1
A	1
duel	1
in	1
my	1
garden.	1
Go	1
home,	1
gentlemen,	1
go	1
home.	1
Why,	1
what	1
did	1
you	1
quarrel	1
about?"	1
"We	1
quarrelled,"	1
said	1
Evan,	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
dead	1
voice,	1
"about	1
religion."	1
The	1
fat	1
shopkeeper	1
rolled	1
about	1
in	1
his	1
chair	1
with	1
enjoyment.	1
"Well,	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
funny	1
game,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"So	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
commit	1
murder	1
on	1
behalf	1
of	1
religion.	1
Well,	1
well	1
my	1
religion	1
is	1
a	1
little	1
respect	1
for	1
humanity,	1
and----"	1
"Excuse	1
me,"	1
cut	1
in	1
Turnbull,	1
suddenly	1
and	1
fiercely,	1
pointing	1
towards	1
the	1
pawnbroker's	1
next	1
door.	1
"Don't	1
you	1
own	1
that	1
shop?"	1
"Why--er--yes,"	1
said	1
Gordon.	1
"And	1
don't	1
you	1
own	1
that	1
shop?"	1
repeated	1
the	1
secularist,	1
pointing	1
backward	1
to	1
the	1
pornographic	1
bookseller.	1
"What	1
if	1
I	1
do?"	1
"Why,	1
then,"	1
cried	1
Turnbull,	1
with	1
grating	1
contempt.	1
"I	1
will	1
leave	1
the	1
religion	1
of	1
humanity	1
confidently	1
in	1
your	1
hands;	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
sorry	1
I	1
troubled	1
you	1
about	1
such	1
a	1
thing	1
as	1
honour.	1
Look	1
here,	1
my	1
man.	1
I	1
do	1
believe	1
in	1
humanity.	1
I	1
do	1
believe	1
in	1
liberty.	1
My	1
father	1
died	1
for	1
it	1
under	1
the	1
swords	1
of	1
the	1
Yeomanry.	1
I	1
am	1
going	1
to	1
die	1
for	1
it,	1
if	1
need	1
be,	1
under	1
that	1
sword	1
on	1
your	1
counter.	1
But	1
if	1
there	1
is	1
one	1
sight	1
that	1
makes	1
me	1
doubt	1
it	1
it	1
is	1
your	1
foul	1
fat	1
face.	1
It	1
is	1
hard	1
to	1
believe	1
you	1
were	1
not	1
meant	1
to	1
be	1
ruled	1
like	1
a	1
dog	1
or	1
killed	1
like	1
a	1
cockroach.	1
Don't	1
try	1
your	1
slave's	1
philosophy	1
on	1
me.	1
We	1
are	1
going	1
to	1
fight,	1
and	1
we	1
are	1
going	1
to	1
fight	1
in	1
your	1
garden,	1
with	1
your	1
swords.	1
Be	1
still!	1
Raise	1
your	1
voice	1
above	1
a	1
whisper,	1
and	1
I	1
run	1
you	1
through	1
the	1
body."	1
Turnbull	1
put	1
the	1
bright	1
point	1
of	1
the	1
sword	1
against	1
the	1
gay	1
waistcoat	1
of	1
the	1
dealer,	1
who	1
stood	1
choking	1
with	1
rage	1
and	1
fear,	1
and	1
an	1
astonishment	1
so	1
crushing	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
greater	1
than	1
either.	1
"MacIan,"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
falling	1
almost	1
into	1
the	1
familiar	1
tone	1
of	1
a	1
business	1
partner,	1
"MacIan,	1
tie	1
up	1
this	1
fellow	1
and	1
put	1
a	1
gag	1
in	1
his	1
mouth.	1
Be	1
still,	1
I	1
say,	1
or	1
I	1
kill	1
you	1
where	1
you	1
stand."	1
The	1
man	1
was	1
too	1
frightened	1
to	1
scream,	1
but	1
he	1
struggled	1
wildly,	1
while	1
Evan	1
MacIan,	1
whose	1
long,	1
lean	1
hands	1
were	1
unusually	1
powerful,	1
tightened	1
some	1
old	1
curtain	1
cords	1
round	1
him,	1
strapped	1
a	1
rope	1
gag	1
in	1
his	1
mouth	1
and	1
rolled	1
him	1
on	1
his	1
back	1
on	1
the	1
floor.	1
"There's	1
nothing	1
very	1
strong	1
here,"	1
said	1
Evan,	1
looking	1
about	1
him.	1
"I'm	1
afraid	1
he'll	1
work	1
through	1
that	1
gag	1
in	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
or	1
so."	1
"Yes,"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
"but	1
one	1
of	1
us	1
will	1
be	1
killed	1
by	1
that	1
time."	1
"Well,	1
let's	1
hope	1
so,"	1
said	1
the	1
Highlander,	1
glancing	1
doubtfully	1
at	1
the	1
squirming	1
thing	1
on	1
the	1
floor.	1
"And	1
now,"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
twirling	1
his	1
fiery	1
moustache	1
and	1
fingering	1
his	1
sword,	1
"let	1
us	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
garden.	1
What	1
an	1
exquisite	1
summer	1
evening!"	1
MacIan	1
said	1
nothing,	1
but	1
lifting	1
his	1
sword	1
from	1
the	1
counter	1
went	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
sun.	1
The	1
brilliant	1
light	1
ran	1
along	1
the	1
blades,	1
filling	1
the	1
channels	1
of	1
them	1
with	1
white	1
fire;	1
the	1
combatants	1
stuck	1
their	1
swords	1
in	1
the	1
turf	1
and	1
took	1
off	1
their	1
hats,	1
coats,	1
waistcoats,	1
and	1
boots.	1
Evan	1
said	1
a	1
short	1
Latin	1
prayer	1
to	1
himself,	1
during	1
which	1
Turnbull	1
made	1
something	1
of	1
a	1
parade	1
of	1
lighting	1
a	1
cigarette	1
which	1
he	1
flung	1
away	1
the	1
instant	1
after,	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
MacIan	1
apparently	1
standing	1
ready.	1
Yet	1
MacIan	1
was	1
not	1
exactly	1
ready.	1
He	1
stood	1
staring	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
stricken	1
with	1
a	1
trance.	1
"What	1
are	1
you	1
staring	1
at?"	1
asked	1
Turnbull.	1
"Do	1
you	1
see	1
the	1
bobbies?"	1
"I	1
see	1
Jerusalem,"	1
said	1
Evan,	1
"all	1
covered	1
with	1
the	1
shields	1
and	1
standards	1
of	1
the	1
Saracens."	1
"Jerusalem!"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
laughing.	1
"Well,	1
we've	1
taken	1
the	1
only	1
inhabitant	1
into	1
captivity."	1
And	1
he	1
picked	1
up	1
his	1
sword	1
and	1
made	1
it	1
whistle	1
like	1
a	1
boy's	1
wand.	1
"I	1
beg	1
your	1
pardon,"	1
said	1
MacIan,	1
dryly.	1
"Let	1
us	1
begin."	1
MacIan	1
made	1
a	1
military	1
salute	1
with	1
his	1
weapon,	1
which	1
Turnbull	1
copied	1
or	1
parodied	1
with	1
an	1
impatient	1
contempt;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
stillness	1
of	1
the	1
garden	1
the	1
swords	1
came	1
together	1
with	1
a	1
clear	1
sound	1
like	1
a	1
bell.	1
The	1
instant	1
the	1
blades	1
touched,	1
each	1
felt	1
them	1
tingle	1
to	1
their	1
very	1
points	1
with	1
a	1
personal	1
vitality,	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
two	1
naked	1
nerves	1
of	1
steel.	1
Evan	1
had	1
worn	1
throughout	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
apathy,	1
which	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
stale	1
apathy	1
of	1
one	1
who	1
wants	1
nothing.	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
indeed	1
the	1
more	1
dreadful	1
apathy	1
of	1
one	1
who	1
wants	1
something	1
and	1
will	1
care	1
for	1
nothing	1
else.	1
And	1
this	1
was	1
seen	1
suddenly;	1
for	1
the	1
instant	1
Evan	1
engaged	1
he	1
disengaged	1
and	1
lunged	1
with	1
an	1
infernal	1
violence.	1
His	1
opponent	1
with	1
a	1
desperate	1
promptitude	1
parried	1
and	1
riposted;	1
the	1
parry	1
only	1
just	1
succeeded,	1
the	1
riposte	1
failed.	1
Something	1
big	1
and	1
unbearable	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
broken	1
finally	1
out	1
of	1
Evan	1
in	1
that	1
first	1
murderous	1
lunge,	1
leaving	1
him	1
lighter	1
and	1
cooler	1
and	1
quicker	1
upon	1
his	1
feet.	1
He	1
fell	1
to	1
again,	1
fiercely	1
still,	1
but	1
now	1
with	1
a	1
fierce	1
caution.	1
The	1
next	1
moment	1
Turnbull	1
lunged;	1
MacIan	1
seemed	1
to	1
catch	1
the	1
point	1
and	1
throw	1
it	1
away	1
from	1
him,	1
and	1
was	1
thrusting	1
back	1
like	1
a	1
thunderbolt,	1
when	1
a	1
sound	1
paralysed	1
him;	1
another	1
sound	1
beside	1
their	1
ringing	1
weapons.	1
Turnbull,	1
perhaps	1
from	1
an	1
equal	1
astonishment,	1
perhaps	1
from	1
chivalry,	1
stopped	1
also	1
and	1
forebore	1
to	1
send	1
his	1
sword	1
through	1
his	1
exposed	1
enemy.	1
"What's	1
that?"	1
asked	1
Evan,	1
hoarsely.	1
A	1
heavy	1
scraping	1
sound,	1
as	1
of	1
a	1
trunk	1
being	1
dragged	1
along	1
a	1
littered	1
floor,	1
came	1
from	1
the	1
dark	1
shop	1
behind	1
them.	1
"The	1
old	1
Jew	1
has	1
broken	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
strings,	1
and	1
he's	1
crawling	1
about,"	1
said	1
Turnbull.	1
"Be	1
quick!	1
We	1
must	1
finish	1
before	1
he	1
gets	1
his	1
gag	1
out."	1
"Yes,	1
yes,	1
quick!	1
On	1
guard!"	1
cried	1
the	1
Highlander.	1
The	1
blades	1
crossed	1
again	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
sound	1
like	1
song,	1
and	1
the	1
men	1
went	1
to	1
work	1
again	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
white	1
and	1
watchful	1
faces.	1
Evan,	1
in	1
his	1
impatience,	1
went	1
back	1
a	1
little	1
to	1
his	1
wildness.	1
He	1
made	1
windmills,	1
as	1
the	1
French	1
duellists	1
say,	1
and	1
though	1
he	1
was	1
probably	1
a	1
shade	1
the	1
better	1
fencer	1
of	1
the	1
two,	1
he	1
found	1
the	1
other's	1
point	1
pass	1
his	1
face	1
twice	1
so	1
close	1
as	1
almost	1
to	1
graze	1
his	1
cheek.	1
The	1
second	1
time	1
he	1
realized	1
the	1
actual	1
possibility	1
of	1
defeat	1
and	1
pulled	1
himself	1
together	1
under	1
a	1
shock	1
of	1
the	1
sanity	1
of	1
anger.	1
He	1
narrowed,	1
and,	1
so	1
to	1
speak,	1
tightened	1
his	1
operations:	1
he	1
fenced	1
(as	1
the	1
swordsman's	1
boast	1
goes),	1
in	1
a	1
wedding	1
ring;	1
he	1
turned	1
Turnbull's	1
thrusts	1
with	1
a	1
maddening	1
and	1
almost	1
mechanical	1
click,	1
like	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
machine.	1
Whenever	1
Turnbull's	1
sword	1
sought	1
to	1
go	1
over	1
that	1
other	1
mere	1
white	1
streak	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
caught	1
in	1
a	1
complex	1
network	1
of	1
steel.	1
He	1
turned	1
one	1
thrust,	1
turned	1
another,	1
turned	1
another.	1
Then	1
suddenly	1
he	1
went	1
forward	1
at	1
the	1
lunge	1
with	1
his	1
whole	1
living	1
weight.	1
Turnbull	1
leaped	1
back,	1
but	1
Evan	1
lunged	1
and	1
lunged	1
and	1
lunged	1
again	1
like	1
a	1
devilish	1
piston	1
rod	1
or	1
battering	1
ram.	1
And	1
high	1
above	1
all	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
struggle	1
there	1
broke	1
into	1
the	1
silent	1
evening	1
a	1
bellowing	1
human	1
voice,	1
nasal,	1
raucous,	1
at	1
the	1
highest	1
pitch	1
of	1
pain.	1
"Help!	1
Help!	1
Police!	1
Murder!	1
Murder!"	1
The	1
gag	1
was	1
broken;	1
and	1
the	1
tongue	1
of	1
terror	1
was	1
loose.	1
"Keep	1
on!"	1
gasped	1
Turnbull.	1
"One	1
may	1
be	1
killed	1
before	1
they	1
come."	1
The	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
screaming	1
shopkeeper	1
was	1
loud	1
enough	1
to	1
drown	1
not	1
only	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
the	1
swords	1
but	1
all	1
other	1
noises	1
around	1
it,	1
but	1
even	1
through	1
its	1
rending	1
din	1
there	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
some	1
other	1
stir	1
or	1
scurry.	1
And	1
Evan,	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
act	1
of	1
thrusting	1
at	1
Turnbull,	1
saw	1
something	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
that	1
made	1
him	1
drop	1
his	1
sword.	1
The	1
atheist,	1
with	1
his	1
grey	1
eyes	1
at	1
their	1
widest	1
and	1
wildest,	1
was	1
staring	1
straight	1
over	1
his	1
shoulder	1
at	1
the	1
little	1
archway	1
of	1
shop	1
that	1
opened	1
on	1
the	1
street	1
beyond.	1
And	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
archway	1
blocked	1
and	1
blackened	1
with	1
strange	1
figures.	1
"We	1
must	1
bolt,	1
MacIan,"	1
he	1
said	1
abruptly.	1
"And	1
there	1
isn't	1
a	1
damned	1
second	1
to	1
lose	1
either.	1
Do	1
as	1
I	1
do."	1
With	1
a	1
bound	1
he	1
was	1
beside	1
the	1
little	1
cluster	1
of	1
his	1
clothes	1
and	1
boots	1
that	1
lay	1
on	1
the	1
lawn;	1
he	1
snatched	1
them	1
up,	1
without	1
waiting	1
to	1
put	1
any	1
of	1
them	1
on;	1
and	1
tucking	1
his	1
sword	1
under	1
his	1
other	1
arm,	1
went	1
wildly	1
at	1
the	1
wall	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
garden	1
and	1
swung	1
himself	1
over	1
it.	1
Three	1
seconds	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
alighted	1
in	1
his	1
socks	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side,	1
MacIan	1
alighted	1
beside	1
him,	1
also	1
in	1
his	1
socks	1
and	1
also	1
carrying	1
clothes	1
and	1
sword	1
in	1
a	1
desperate	1
bundle.	1
They	1
were	1
in	1
a	1
by-street,	1
very	1
lean	1
and	1
lonely	1
itself,	1
but	1
so	1
close	1
to	1
a	1
crowded	1
thoroughfare	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
see	1
the	1
vague	1
masses	1
of	1
vehicles	1
going	1
by,	1
and	1
could	1
even	1
see	1
an	1
individual	1
hansom	1
cab	1
passing	1
the	1
corner	1
at	1
the	1
instant.	1
Turnbull	1
put	1
his	1
fingers	1
to	1
his	1
mouth	1
like	1
a	1
gutter-snipe	1
and	1
whistled	1
twice.	1
Even	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
so	1
he	1
could	1
hear	1
the	1
loud	1
voices	1
of	1
the	1
neighbours	1
and	1
the	1
police	1
coming	1
down	1
the	1
garden.	1
The	1
hansom	1
swung	1
sharply	1
and	1
came	1
tearing	1
down	1
the	1
little	1
lane	1
at	1
his	1
call.	1
When	1
the	1
cabman	1
saw	1
his	1
fares,	1
however,	1
two	1
wild-haired	1
men	1
in	1
their	1
shirts	1
and	1
socks	1
with	1
naked	1
swords	1
under	1
their	1
arms,	1
he	1
not	1
unnaturally	1
brought	1
his	1
readiness	1
to	1
a	1
rigid	1
stop	1
and	1
stared	1
suspiciously.	1
"You	1
talk	1
to	1
him	1
a	1
minute,"	1
whispered	1
Turnbull,	1
and	1
stepped	1
back	1
into	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
the	1
wall.	1
"We	1
want	1
you,"	1
said	1
MacIan	1
to	1
the	1
cabman,	1
with	1
a	1
superb	1
Scotch	1
drawl	1
of	1
indifference	1
and	1
assurance,	1
"to	1
drive	1
us	1
to	1
St.	1
Pancras	1
Station--verra	1
quick."	1
"Very	1
sorry,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
the	1
cabman,	1
"but	1
I'd	1
like	1
to	1
know	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
right.	1
Might	1
I	1
arst	1
where	1
you	1
come	1
from,	1
sir?"	1
A	1
second	1
after	1
he	1
spoke	1
MacIan	1
heard	1
a	1
heavy	1
voice	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
wall,	1
saying:	1
"I	1
suppose	1
I'd	1
better	1
get	1
over	1
and	1
look	1
for	1
them.	1
Give	1
me	1
a	1
back."	1
"Cabby,"	1
said	1
MacIan,	1
again	1
assuming	1
the	1
most	1
deliberate	1
and	1
lingering	1
lowland	1
Scotch	1
intonation,	1
"if	1
ye're	1
really	1
verra	1
anxious	1
to	1
ken	1
whar	1
a'	1
come	1
fra',	1
I'll	1
tell	1
ye	1
as	1
a	1
verra	1
great	1
secret.	1
A'	1
come	1
from	1
Scotland.	1
And	1
a'm	1
gaein'	1
to	1
St.	1
Pancras	1
Station.	1
Open	1
the	1
doors,	1
cabby."	1
The	1
cabman	1
stared,	1
but	1
laughed.	1
The	1
heavy	1
voice	1
behind	1
the	1
wall	1
said:	1
"Now	1
then,	1
a	1
better	1
back	1
this	1
time,	1
Mr.	1
Price."	1
And	1
from	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
the	1
wall	1
Turnbull	1
crept	1
out.	1
He	1
had	1
struggled	1
wildly	1
into	1
his	1
coat	1
(leaving	1
his	1
waistcoat	1
on	1
the	1
pavement),	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
with	1
a	1
fierce	1
pale	1
face	1
climbing	1
up	1
the	1
cab	1
behind	1
the	1
cabman.	1
MacIan	1
had	1
no	1
glimmering	1
notion	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
up	1
to,	1
but	1
an	1
instinct	1
of	1
discipline,	1
inherited	1
from	1
a	1
hundred	1
men	1
of	1
war,	1
made	1
him	1
stick	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
part	1
and	1
trust	1
the	1
other	1
man's.	1
"Open	1
the	1
doors,	1
cabby,"	1
he	1
repeated,	1
with	1
something	1
of	1
the	1
obstinate	1
solemnity	1
of	1
a	1
drunkard,	1
"open	1
the	1
doors.	1
Did	1
ye	1
no	1
hear	1
me	1
say	1
St.	1
Pancras	1
Station?"	1
The	1
top	1
of	1
a	1
policeman's	1
helmet	1
appeared	1
above	1
the	1
garden	1
wall.	1
The	1
cabman	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
it,	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
still	1
suspicious	1
and	1
began:	1
"Very	1
sorry,	1
sir,	1
but..."	1
and	1
with	1
that	1
the	1
catlike	1
Turnbull	1
tore	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
seat	1
and	1
hurled	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
street	1
below,	1
where	1
he	1
lay	1
suddenly	1
stunned.	1
"Give	1
me	1
his	1
hat,"	1
said	1
Turnbull	1
in	1
a	1
silver	1
voice,	1
that	1
the	1
other	1
obeyed	1
like	1
a	1
bugle.	1
"And	1
get	1
inside	1
with	1
the	1
swords."	1
And	1
just	1
as	1
the	1
red	1
and	1
raging	1
face	1
of	1
a	1
policeman	1
appeared	1
above	1
the	1
wall,	1
Turnbull	1
struck	1
the	1
horse	1
with	1
a	1
terrible	1
cut	1
of	1
the	1
whip	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
went	1
whirling	1
away	1
like	1
a	1
boomerang.	1
They	1
had	1
spun	1
through	1
seven	1
streets	1
and	1
three	1
or	1
four	1
squares	1
before	1
anything	1
further	1
happened.	1
Then,	1
in	1
the	1
neighbourhood	1
of	1
Maida	1
Vale,	1
the	1
driver	1
opened	1
the	1
trap	1
and	1
talked	1
through	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
manner	1
not	1
wholly	1
common	1
in	1
conversations	1
through	1
that	1
aperture.	1
"Mr.	1
MacIan,"	1
he	1
said	1
shortly	1
and	1
civilly.	1
"Mr.	1
Turnbull,"	1
replied	1
his	1
motionless	1
fare.	1
"Under	1
circumstances	1
such	1
as	1
those	1
in	1
which	1
we	1
were	1
both	1
recently	1
placed	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
time	1
for	1
anything	1
but	1
very	1
abrupt	1
action.	1
I	1
trust	1
therefore	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
no	1
cause	1
to	1
complain	1
of	1
me	1
if	1
I	1
have	1
deferred	1
until	1
this	1
moment	1
a	1
consultation	1
with	1
you	1
on	1
our	1
present	1
position	1
or	1
future	1
action.	1
Our	1
present	1
position,	1
Mr.	1
MacIan,	1
I	1
imagine	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
under	1
no	1
special	1
necessity	1
of	1
describing.	1
We	1
have	1
broken	1
the	1
law	1
and	1
we	1
are	1
fleeing	1
from	1
its	1
officers.	1
Our	1
future	1
action	1
is	1
a	1
thing	1
about	1
which	1
I	1
myself	1
entertain	1
sufficiently	1
strong	1
views;	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
right	1
to	1
assume	1
or	1
to	1
anticipate	1
yours,	1
though	1
I	1
may	1
have	1
formed	1
a	1
decided	1
conception	1
of	1
your	1
character	1
and	1
a	1
decided	1
notion	1
of	1
what	1
they	1
will	1
probably	1
be.	1
Still,	1
by	1
every	1
principle	1
of	1
intellectual	1
justice,	1
I	1
am	1
bound	1
to	1
ask	1
you	1
now	1
and	1
seriously	1
whether	1
you	1
wish	1
to	1
continue	1
our	1
interrupted	1
relations."	1
MacIan	1
leant	1
his	1
white	1
and	1
rather	1
weary	1
face	1
back	1
upon	1
the	1
cushions	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
speak	1
up	1
through	1
the	1
open	1
door.	1
"Mr.	1
Turnbull,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"I	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
add	1
to	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
said	1
before.	1
It	1
is	1
strongly	1
borne	1
in	1
upon	1
me	1
that	1
you	1
and	1
I,	1
the	1
sole	1
occupants	1
of	1
this	1
runaway	1
cab,	1
are	1
at	1
this	1
moment	1
the	1
two	1
most	1
important	1
people	1
in	1
London,	1
possibly	1
in	1
Europe.	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
looking	1
at	1
all	1
the	1
streets	1
as	1
we	1
went	1
past,	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
looking	1
at	1
all	1
the	1
shops	1
as	1
we	1
went	1
past,	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
looking	1
at	1
all	1
the	1
churches	1
as	1
we	1
went	1
past.	1
At	1
first,	1
I	1
felt	1
a	1
little	1
dazed	1
with	1
the	1
vastness	1
of	1
it	1
all.	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
understand	1
what	1
it	1
all	1
meant.	1
But	1
now	1
I	1
know	1
exactly	1
what	1
it	1
all	1
means.	1
It	1
means	1
us.	1
This	1
whole	1
civilization	1
is	1
only	1
a	1
dream.	1
You	1
and	1
I	1
are	1
the	1
realities."	1
"Religious	1
symbolism,"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Turnbull,	1
through	1
the	1
trap,	1
"does	1
not,	1
as	1
you	1
are	1
probably	1
aware,	1
appeal	1
ordinarily	1
to	1
thinkers	1
of	1
the	1
school	1
to	1
which	1
I	1
belong.	1
But	1
in	1
symbolism	1
as	1
you	1
use	1
it	1
in	1
this	1
instance,	1
I	1
must,	1
I	1
think,	1
concede	1
a	1
certain	1
truth.	1
We	1
_must_	1
fight	1
this	1
thing	1
out	1
somewhere;	1
because,	1
as	1
you	1
truly	1
say,	1
we	1
have	1
found	1
each	1
other's	1
reality.	1
We	1
_must_	1
kill	1
each	1
other--or	1
convert	1
each	1
other.	1
I	1
used	1
to	1
think	1
all	1
Christians	1
were	1
hypocrites,	1
and	1
I	1
felt	1
quite	1
mildly	1
towards	1
them	1
really.	1
But	1
I	1
know	1
you	1
are	1
sincere--and	1
my	1
soul	1
is	1
mad	1
against	1
you.	1
In	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
you	1
used,	1
I	1
suppose,	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
all	1
atheists	1
thought	1
atheism	1
would	1
leave	1
them	1
free	1
for	1
immorality--and	1
yet	1
in	1
your	1
heart	1
you	1
tolerated	1
them	1
entirely.	1
Now	1
you	1
_know_	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
an	1
honest	1
man,	1
and	1
you	1
are	1
mad	1
against	1
me,	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
against	1
you.	1
Yes,	1
that's	1
it.	1
You	1
can't	1
be	1
angry	1
with	1
bad	1
men.	1
But	1
a	1
good	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
wrong--why	1
one	1
thirsts	1
for	1
his	1
blood.	1
Yes,	1
you	1
open	1
for	1
me	1
a	1
vista	1
of	1
thought."	1
"Don't	1
run	1
into	1
anything,"	1
said	1
Evan,	1
immovably.	1
"There's	1
something	1
in	1
that	1
view	1
of	1
yours,	1
too,"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
and	1
shut	1
down	1
the	1
trap.	1
They	1
sped	1
on	1
through	1
shining	1
streets	1
that	1
shot	1
by	1
them	1
like	1
arrows.	1
Mr.	1
Turnbull	1
had	1
evidently	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
unused	1
practical	1
talent	1
which	1
was	1
unrolling	1
itself	1
in	1
this	1
ridiculous	1
adventure.	1
They	1
had	1
got	1
away	1
with	1
such	1
stunning	1
promptitude	1
that	1
the	1
police	1
chase	1
had	1
in	1
all	1
probability	1
not	1
even	1
properly	1
begun.	1
But	1
in	1
case	1
it	1
had,	1
the	1
amateur	1
cabman	1
chose	1
his	1
dizzy	1
course	1
through	1
London	1
with	1
a	1
strange	1
dexterity.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
do	1
what	1
would	1
have	1
first	1
occurred	1
to	1
any	1
ordinary	1
outsider	1
desiring	1
to	1
destroy	1
his	1
tracks.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
cut	1
into	1
by-ways	1
or	1
twist	1
his	1
way	1
through	1
mean	1
streets.	1
His	1
amateur	1
common	1
sense	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
precisely	1
the	1
poor	1
street,	1
the	1
side	1
street,	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
likely	1
to	1
remember	1
and	1
report	1
the	1
passing	1
of	1
a	1
hansom	1
cab,	1
like	1
the	1
passing	1
of	1
a	1
royal	1
procession.	1
He	1
kept	1
chiefly	1
to	1
the	1
great	1
roads,	1
so	1
full	1
of	1
hansoms	1
that	1
a	1
wilder	1
pair	1
than	1
they	1
might	1
easily	1
have	1
passed	1
in	1
the	1
press.	1
In	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
quieter	1
streets	1
Evan	1
put	1
on	1
his	1
boots.	1
Towards	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
Albany	1
Street	1
the	1
singular	1
cabman	1
again	1
opened	1
the	1
trap.	1
"Mr.	1
MacIan,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"I	1
understand	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
now	1
definitely	1
settled	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
conventional	1
language	1
honour	1
is	1
not	1
satisfied.	1
Our	1
action	1
must	1
at	1
least	1
go	1
further	1
than	1
it	1
has	1
gone	1
under	1
recent	1
interrupted	1
conditions.	1
That,	1
I	1
believe,	1
is	1
understood."	1
"Perfectly,"	1
replied	1
the	1
other	1
with	1
his	1
bootlace	1
in	1
his	1
teeth.	1
"Under	1
those	1
conditions,"	1
continued	1
Turnbull,	1
his	1
voice	1
coming	1
through	1
the	1
hole	1
with	1
a	1
slight	1
note	1
of	1
trepidation	1
very	1
unusual	1
with	1
him,	1
"I	1
have	1
a	1
suggestion	1
to	1
make,	1
if	1
that	1
can	1
be	1
called	1
a	1
suggestion,	1
which	1
has	1
probably	1
occurred	1
to	1
you	1
as	1
readily	1
as	1
to	1
me.	1
Until	1
the	1
actual	1
event	1
comes	1
off	1
we	1
are	1
practically	1
in	1
the	1
position	1
if	1
not	1
of	1
comrades,	1
at	1
least	1
of	1
business	1
partners.	1
Until	1
the	1
event	1
comes	1
off,	1
therefore	1
I	1
should	1
suggest	1
that	1
quarrelling	1
would	1
be	1
inconvenient	1
and	1
rather	1
inartistic;	1
while	1
the	1
ordinary	1
exchange	1
of	1
politeness	1
between	1
man	1
and	1
man	1
would	1
be	1
not	1
only	1
elegant	1
but	1
uncommonly	1
practical."	1
"You	1
are	1
perfectly	1
right,"	1
answered	1
MacIan,	1
with	1
his	1
melancholy	1
voice,	1
"in	1
saying	1
that	1
all	1
this	1
has	1
occurred	1
to	1
me.	1
All	1
duellists	1
should	1
behave	1
like	1
gentlemen	1
to	1
each	1
other.	1
But	1
we,	1
by	1
the	1
queerness	1
of	1
our	1
position,	1
are	1
something	1
much	1
more	1
than	1
either	1
duellists	1
or	1
gentlemen.	1
We	1
are,	1
in	1
the	1
oddest	1
and	1
most	1
exact	1
sense	1
of	1
the	1
term,	1
brothers--in	1
arms."	1
"Mr.	1
MacIan,"	1
replied	1
Turnbull,	1
calmly,	1
"no	1
more	1
need	1
be	1
said."	1
And	1
he	1
closed	1
the	1
trap	1
once	1
more.	1
They	1
had	1
reached	1
Finchley	1
Road	1
before	1
he	1
opened	1
it	1
again.	1
Then	1
he	1
said,	1
"Mr.	1
MacIan,	1
may	1
I	1
offer	1
you	1
a	1
cigar.	1
It	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
touch	1
of	1
realism."	1
"Thank	1
you,"	1
answered	1
Evan.	1
"You	1
are	1
very	1
kind."	1
And	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
smoke	1
in	1
the	1
cab.	1
IV.	1
A	1
DISCUSSION	1
AT	1
DAWN	1
The	1
duellists	1
had	1
from	1
their	1
own	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
escaped	1
or	1
conquered	1
the	1
chief	1
powers	1
of	1
the	1
modern	1
world.	1
They	1
had	1
satisfied	1
the	1
magistrate,	1
they	1
had	1
tied	1
the	1
tradesman	1
neck	1
and	1
heels,	1
and	1
they	1
had	1
left	1
the	1
police	1
behind.	1
As	1
far	1
as	1
their	1
own	1
feelings	1
went	1
they	1
had	1
melted	1
into	1
a	1
monstrous	1
sea;	1
they	1
were	1
but	1
the	1
fare	1
and	1
driver	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
million	1
hansoms	1
that	1
fill	1
London	1
streets.	1
But	1
they	1
had	1
forgotten	1
something;	1
they	1
had	1
forgotten	1
journalism.	1
They	1
had	1
forgotten	1
that	1
there	1
exists	1
in	1
the	1
modern	1
world,	1
perhaps	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
in	1
history,	1
a	1
class	1
of	1
people	1
whose	1
interest	1
is	1
not	1
that	1
things	1
should	1
happen	1
well	1
or	1
happen	1
badly,	1
should	1
happen	1
successfully	1
or	1
happen	1
unsuccessfully,	1
should	1
happen	1
to	1
the	1
advantage	1
of	1
this	1
party	1
or	1
the	1
advantage	1
of	1
that	1
part,	1
but	1
whose	1
interest	1
simply	1
is	1
that	1
things	1
should	1
happen.	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
one	1
great	1
weakness	1
of	1
journalism	1
as	1
a	1
picture	1
of	1
our	1
modern	1
existence,	1
that	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
picture	1
made	1
up	1
entirely	1
of	1
exceptions.	1
We	1
announce	1
on	1
flaring	1
posters	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
has	1
fallen	1
off	1
a	1
scaffolding.	1
We	1
do	1
not	1
announce	1
on	1
flaring	1
posters	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
has	1
not	1
fallen	1
off	1
a	1
scaffolding.	1
Yet	1
this	1
latter	1
fact	1
is	1
fundamentally	1
more	1
exciting,	1
as	1
indicating	1
that	1
that	1
moving	1
tower	1
of	1
terror	1
and	1
mystery,	1
a	1
man,	1
is	1
still	1
abroad	1
upon	1
the	1
earth.	1
That	1
the	1
man	1
has	1
not	1
fallen	1
off	1
a	1
scaffolding	1
is	1
really	1
more	1
sensational;	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
also	1
some	1
thousand	1
times	1
more	1
common.	1
But	1
journalism	1
cannot	1
reasonably	1
be	1
expected	1
thus	1
to	1
insist	1
upon	1
the	1
permanent	1
miracles.	1
Busy	1
editors	1
cannot	1
be	1
expected	1
to	1
put	1
on	1
their	1
posters,	1
"Mr.	1
Wilkinson	1
Still	1
Safe,"	1
or	1
"Mr.	1
Jones,	1
of	1
Worthing,	1
Not	1
Dead	1
Yet."	1
They	1
cannot	1
announce	1
the	1
happiness	1
of	1
mankind	1
at	1
all.	1
They	1
cannot	1
describe	1
all	1
the	1
forks	1
that	1
are	1
not	1
stolen,	1
or	1
all	1
the	1
marriages	1
that	1
are	1
not	1
judiciously	1
dissolved.	1
Hence	1
the	1
complete	1
picture	1
they	1
give	1
of	1
life	1
is	1
of	1
necessity	1
fallacious;	1
they	1
can	1
only	1
represent	1
what	1
is	1
unusual.	1
However	1
democratic	1
they	1
may	1
be,	1
they	1
are	1
only	1
concerned	1
with	1
the	1
minority.	1
The	1
incident	1
of	1
the	1
religious	1
fanatic	1
who	1
broke	1
a	1
window	1
on	1
Ludgate	1
Hill	1
was	1
alone	1
enough	1
to	1
set	1
them	1
up	1
in	1
good	1
copy	1
for	1
the	1
night.	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
same	1
man	1
was	1
brought	1
before	1
a	1
magistrate	1
and	1
defied	1
his	1
enemy	1
to	1
mortal	1
combat	1
in	1
the	1
open	1
court,	1
then	1
the	1
columns	1
would	1
hardly	1
hold	1
the	1
excruciating	1
information,	1
and	1
the	1
headlines	1
were	1
so	1
large	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
hardly	1
room	1
for	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
text.	1
The	1
_Daily	1
Telegraph_	1
headed	1
a	1
column,	1
"A	1
Duel	1
on	1
Divinity,"	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
correspondence	1
afterwards	1
which	1
lasted	1
for	1
months,	1
about	1
whether	1
police	1
magistrates	1
ought	1
to	1
mention	1
religion.	1
The	1
_Daily	1
Mail_	1
in	1
its	1
dull,	1
sensible	1
way,	1
headed	1
the	1
events,	1
"Wanted	1
to	1
fight	1
for	1
the	1
Virgin."	1
Mr.	1
James	1
Douglas,	1
in	1
_The	1
Star_,	1
presuming	1
on	1
his	1
knowledge	1
of	1
philosophical	1
and	1
theological	1
terms,	1
described	1
the	1
Christian's	1
outbreak	1
under	1
the	1
title	1
of	1
"Dualist	1
and	1
Duellist."	1
The	1
_Daily	1
News_	1
inserted	1
a	1
colourless	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
matter,	1
but	1
was	1
pursued	1
and	1
eaten	1
up	1
for	1
some	1
weeks,	1
with	1
letters	1
from	1
outlying	1
ministers,	1
headed	1
"Murder	1
and	1
Mariolatry."	1
But	1
the	1
journalistic	1
temperature	1
was	1
steadily	1
and	1
consistently	1
heated	1
by	1
all	1
these	1
influences;	1
the	1
journalists	1
had	1
tasted	1
blood,	1
prospectively,	1
and	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
mood	1
for	1
more;	1
everything	1
in	1
the	1
matter	1
prepared	1
them	1
for	1
further	1
outbursts	1
of	1
moral	1
indignation.	1
And	1
when	1
a	1
gasping	1
reporter	1
rushed	1
in	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
hours	1
of	1
the	1
evening	1
with	1
the	1
announcement	1
that	1
the	1
two	1
heroes	1
of	1
the	1
Police	1
Court	1
had	1
literally	1
been	1
found	1
fighting	1
in	1
a	1
London	1
back	1
garden,	1
with	1
a	1
shopkeeper	1
bound	1
and	1
gagged	1
in	1
the	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
the	1
editors	1
and	1
sub-editors	1
were	1
stricken	1
still	1
as	1
men	1
are	1
by	1
great	1
beatitudes.	1
The	1
next	1
morning,	1
five	1
or	1
six	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
London	1
dailies	1
burst	1
out	1
simultaneously	1
into	1
great	1
blossoms	1
of	1
eloquent	1
leader-writing.	1
Towards	1
the	1
end	1
all	1
the	1
leaders	1
tended	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
same,	1
but	1
they	1
all	1
began	1
differently.	1
The	1
_Daily	1
Telegraph_,	1
for	1
instance	1
began,	1
"There	1
will	1
be	1
little	1
difference	1
among	1
our	1
readers	1
or	1
among	1
all	1
truly	1
English	1
and	1
law-abiding	1
men	1
touching	1
the,	1
etc.	1
etc."	1
The	1
_Daily	1
Mail_	1
said,	1
"People	1
must	1
learn,	1
in	1
the	1
modern	1
world,	1
to	1
keep	1
their	1
theological	1
differences	1
to	1
themselves.	1
The	1
fracas,	1
etc.	1
etc."	1
The	1
_Daily	1
News_	1
started,	1
"Nothing	1
could	1
be	1
more	1
inimical	1
to	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
true	1
religion	1
than,	1
etc.	1
etc."	1
The	1
_Times_	1
began	1
with	1
something	1
about	1
Celtic	1
disturbances	1
of	1
the	1
equilibrium	1
of	1
Empire,	1
and	1
the	1
_Daily	1
Express_	1
distinguished	1
itself	1
splendidly	1
by	1
omitting	1
altogether	1
so	1
controversial	1
a	1
matter	1
and	1
substituting	1
a	1
leader	1
about	1
goloshes.	1
And	1
the	1
morning	1
after	1
that,	1
the	1
editors	1
and	1
the	1
newspapers	1
were	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
state,	1
that,	1
as	1
the	1
phrase	1
is,	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
holding	1
them.	1
Whatever	1
secret	1
and	1
elvish	1
thing	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
broods	1
over	1
editors	1
and	1
suddenly	1
turns	1
their	1
brains,	1
that	1
thing	1
had	1
seized	1
on	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
the	1
broken	1
glass	1
and	1
the	1
duel	1
in	1
the	1
garden.	1
It	1
became	1
monstrous	1
and	1
omnipresent,	1
as	1
do	1
in	1
our	1
time	1
the	1
unimportant	1
doings	1
of	1
the	1
sect	1
of	1
the	1
Agapemonites,	1
or	1
as	1
did	1
at	1
an	1
earlier	1
time	1
the	1
dreary	1
dishonesties	1
of	1
the	1
Rhodesian	1
financiers.	1
Questions	1
were	1
asked	1
about	1
it,	1
and	1
even	1
answered,	1
in	1
the	1
House	1
of	1
Commons.	1
The	1
Government	1
was	1
solemnly	1
denounced	1
in	1
the	1
papers	1
for	1
not	1
having	1
done	1
something,	1
nobody	1
knew	1
what,	1
to	1
prevent	1
the	1
window	1
being	1
broken.	1
An	1
enormous	1
subscription	1
was	1
started	1
to	1
reimburse	1
Mr.	1
Gordon,	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
gagged	1
in	1
the	1
shop.	1
Mr.	1
MacIan,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
combatants,	1
became	1
for	1
some	1
mysterious	1
reason,	1
singly	1
and	1
hugely	1
popular	1
as	1
a	1
comic	1
figure	1
in	1
the	1
comic	1
papers	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
stage	1
of	1
the	1
music	1
hall.	1
He	1
was	1
always	1
represented	1
(in	1
defiance	1
of	1
fact),	1
with	1
red	1
whiskers,	1
and	1
a	1
very	1
red	1
nose,	1
and	1
in	1
full	1
Highland	1
costume.	1
And	1
a	1
song,	1
consisting	1
of	1
an	1
unimaginable	1
number	1
of	1
verses,	1
in	1
which	1
his	1
name	1
was	1
rhymed	1
with	1
flat	1
iron,	1
the	1
British	1
Lion,	1
sly	1
'un,	1
dandelion,	1
Spion	1
(With	1
Kop	1
in	1
the	1
next	1
line),	1
was	1
sung	1
to	1
crowded	1
houses	1
every	1
night.	1
The	1
papers	1
developed	1
a	1
devouring	1
thirst	1
for	1
the	1
capture	1
of	1
the	1
fugitives;	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
caught	1
for	1
forty-eight	1
hours,	1
they	1
suddenly	1
turned	1
the	1
whole	1
matter	1
into	1
a	1
detective	1
mystery.	1
Letters	1
under	1
the	1
heading,	1
"Where	1
are	1
They,"	1
poured	1
in	1
to	1
every	1
paper,	1
with	1
every	1
conceivable	1
kind	1
of	1
explanation,	1
running	1
them	1
to	1
earth	1
in	1
the	1
Monument,	1
the	1
Twopenny	1
Tube,	1
Epping	1
Forest,	1
Westminster	1
Abbey,	1
rolled	1
up	1
in	1
carpets	1
at	1
Shoolbreds,	1
locked	1
up	1
in	1
safes	1
in	1
Chancery	1
Lane.	1
Yes,	1
the	1
papers	1
were	1
very	1
interesting,	1
and	1
Mr.	1
Turnbull	1
unrolled	1
a	1
whole	1
bundle	1
of	1
them	1
for	1
the	1
amusement	1
of	1
Mr.	1
MacIan	1
as	1
they	1
sat	1
on	1
a	1
high	1
common	1
to	1
the	1
north	1
of	1
London,	1
in	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
the	1
white	1
dawn.	1
The	1
darkness	1
in	1
the	1
east	1
had	1
been	1
broken	1
with	1
a	1
bar	1
of	1
grey;	1
the	1
bar	1
of	1
grey	1
was	1
split	1
with	1
a	1
sword	1
of	1
silver	1
and	1
morning	1
lifted	1
itself	1
laboriously	1
over	1
London.	1
From	1
the	1
spot	1
where	1
Turnbull	1
and	1
MacIan	1
were	1
sitting	1
on	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
barren	1
steeps	1
behind	1
Hampstead,	1
they	1
could	1
see	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
London	1
shaping	1
itself	1
vaguely	1
and	1
largely	1
in	1
the	1
grey	1
and	1
growing	1
light,	1
until	1
the	1
white	1
sun	1
stood	1
over	1
it	1
and	1
it	1
lay	1
at	1
their	1
feet,	1
the	1
splendid	1
monstrosity	1
that	1
it	1
is.	1
Its	1
bewildering	1
squares	1
and	1
parallelograms	1
were	1
compact	1
and	1
perfect	1
as	1
a	1
Chinese	1
puzzle;	1
an	1
enormous	1
hieroglyphic	1
which	1
man	1
must	1
decipher	1
or	1
die.	1
There	1
fell	1
upon	1
both	1
of	1
them,	1
but	1
upon	1
Turnbull	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
other,	1
because	1
he	1
know	1
more	1
what	1
the	1
scene	1
signified,	1
that	1
quite	1
indescribable	1
sense	1
as	1
of	1
a	1
sublime	1
and	1
passionate	1
and	1
heart-moving	1
futility,	1
which	1
is	1
never	1
evoked	1
by	1
deserts	1
or	1
dead	1
men	1
or	1
men	1
neglected	1
and	1
barbarous,	1
which	1
can	1
only	1
be	1
invoked	1
by	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
enormous	1
genius	1
of	1
man	1
applied	1
to	1
anything	1
other	1
than	1
the	1
best.	1
Turnbull,	1
the	1
old	1
idealistic	1
democrat,	1
had	1
so	1
often	1
reviled	1
the	1
democracy	1
and	1
reviled	1
them	1
justly	1
for	1
their	1
supineness,	1
their	1
snobbishness,	1
their	1
evil	1
reverence	1
for	1
idle	1
things.	1
He	1
was	1
right	1
enough;	1
for	1
our	1
democracy	1
has	1
only	1
one	1
great	1
fault;	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
democratic.	1
And	1
after	1
denouncing	1
so	1
justly	1
average	1
modern	1
men	1
for	1
so	1
many	1
years	1
as	1
sophists	1
and	1
as	1
slaves,	1
he	1
looked	1
down	1
from	1
an	1
empty	1
slope	1
in	1
Hampstead	1
and	1
saw	1
what	1
gods	1
they	1
are.	1
Their	1
achievement	1
seemed	1
all	1
the	1
more	1
heroic	1
and	1
divine,	1
because	1
it	1
seemed	1
doubtful	1
whether	1
it	1
was	1
worth	1
doing	1
at	1
all.	1
There	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
something	1
greater	1
than	1
mere	1
accuracy	1
in	1
making	1
such	1
a	1
mistake	1
as	1
London.	1
And	1
what	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
it	1
all?	1
what	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
ultimate	1
transformation	1
of	1
this	1
common	1
and	1
incredible	1
London	1
man,	1
this	1
workman	1
on	1
a	1
tram	1
in	1
Battersea,	1
his	1
clerk	1
on	1
an	1
omnibus	1
in	1
Cheapside?	1
Turnbull,	1
as	1
he	1
stared	1
drearily,	1
murmured	1
to	1
himself	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
atheistic	1
and	1
revolutionary	1
Swinburne	1
who	1
had	1
intoxicated	1
his	1
youth:	1
"And	1
still	1
we	1
ask	1
if	1
God	1
or	1
man	1
Can	1
loosen	1
thee	1
Lazarus;	1
Bid	1
thee	1
rise	1
up	1
republican,	1
And	1
save	1
thyself	1
and	1
all	1
of	1
us.	1
But	1
no	1
disciple's	1
tongue	1
can	1
say	1
If	1
thou	1
can'st	1
take	1
our	1
sins	1
away."	1
Turnbull	1
shivered	1
slightly	1
as	1
if	1
behind	1
the	1
earthly	1
morning	1
he	1
felt	1
the	1
evening	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
the	1
sunset	1
of	1
so	1
many	1
hopes.	1
Those	1
words	1
were	1
from	1
"Songs	1
before	1
Sunrise".	1
But	1
Turnbull's	1
songs	1
at	1
their	1
best	1
were	1
songs	1
after	1
sunrise,	1
and	1
sunrise	1
had	1
been	1
no	1
such	1
great	1
thing	1
after	1
all.	1
Turnbull	1
shivered	1
again	1
in	1
the	1
sharp	1
morning	1
air.	1
MacIan	1
was	1
also	1
gazing	1
with	1
his	1
face	1
towards	1
the	1
city,	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
that	1
about	1
his	1
blind	1
and	1
mystical	1
stare	1
that	1
told	1
one,	1
so	1
to	1
speak,	1
that	1
his	1
eyes	1
were	1
turned	1
inwards.	1
When	1
Turnbull	1
said	1
something	1
to	1
him	1
about	1
London,	1
they	1
seemed	1
to	1
move	1
as	1
at	1
a	1
summons	1
and	1
come	1
out	1
like	1
two	1
householders	1
coming	1
out	1
into	1
their	1
doorways.	1
"Yes,"	1
he	1
said,	1
with	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
stupidity.	1
"It's	1
a	1
very	1
big	1
place."	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
somewhat	1
unmeaning	1
silence,	1
and	1
then	1
MacIan	1
said	1
again:	1
"It's	1
a	1
very	1
big	1
place.	1
When	1
I	1
first	1
came	1
into	1
it	1
I	1
was	1
frightened	1
of	1
it.	1
Frightened	1
exactly	1
as	1
one	1
would	1
be	1
frightened	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
forty	1
feet	1
high.	1
I	1
am	1
used	1
to	1
big	1
things	1
where	1
I	1
come	1
from,	1
big	1
mountains	1
that	1
seem	1
to	1
fill	1
God's	1
infinity,	1
and	1
the	1
big	1
sea	1
that	1
goes	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
But	1
then	1
these	1
things	1
are	1
all	1
shapeless	1
and	1
confused	1
things,	1
not	1
made	1
in	1
any	1
familiar	1
form.	1
But	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
plain,	1
square,	1
human	1
things	1
as	1
large	1
as	1
that,	1
houses	1
so	1
large	1
and	1
streets	1
so	1
large,	1
and	1
the	1
town	1
itself	1
so	1
large,	1
was	1
like	1
having	1
screwed	1
some	1
devil's	1
magnifying	1
glass	1
into	1
one's	1
eye.	1
It	1
was	1
like	1
seeing	1
a	1
porridge	1
bowl	1
as	1
big	1
as	1
a	1
house,	1
or	1
a	1
mouse-trap	1
made	1
to	1
catch	1
elephants."	1
"Like	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Brobdingnagians,"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
smiling.	1
"Oh!	1
Where	1
is	1
that?"	1
said	1
MacIan.	1
Turnbull	1
said	1
bitterly,	1
"In	1
a	1
book,"	1
and	1
the	1
silence	1
fell	1
suddenly	1
between	1
them	1
again.	1
They	1
were	1
sitting	1
in	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
litter	1
on	1
the	1
hillside;	1
all	1
the	1
things	1
they	1
had	1
hurriedly	1
collected,	1
in	1
various	1
places,	1
for	1
their	1
flight,	1
were	1
strewn	1
indiscriminately	1
round	1
them.	1
The	1
two	1
swords	1
with	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
lately	1
sought	1
each	1
other's	1
lives	1
were	1
flung	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
grass	1
at	1
random,	1
like	1
two	1
idle	1
walking-sticks.	1
Some	1
provisions	1
they	1
had	1
bought	1
last	1
night,	1
at	1
a	1
low	1
public	1
house,	1
in	1
case	1
of	1
undefined	1
contingencies,	1
were	1
tossed	1
about	1
like	1
the	1
materials	1
of	1
an	1
ordinary	1
picnic,	1
here	1
a	1
basket	1
of	1
chocolate,	1
and	1
there	1
a	1
bottle	1
of	1
wine.	1
And	1
to	1
add	1
to	1
the	1
disorder	1
finally,	1
there	1
were	1
strewn	1
on	1
top	1
of	1
everything,	1
the	1
most	1
disorderly	1
of	1
modern	1
things,	1
newspapers,	1
and	1
more	1
newspapers,	1
and	1
yet	1
again	1
newspapers,	1
the	1
ministers	1
of	1
the	1
modern	1
anarchy.	1
Turnbull	1
picked	1
up	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
drearily,	1
and	1
took	1
out	1
a	1
pipe.	1
"There's	1
a	1
lot	1
about	1
us,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"Do	1
you	1
mind	1
if	1
I	1
light	1
up?"	1
"Why	1
should	1
I	1
mind?"	1
asked	1
MacIan.	1
Turnbull	1
eyed	1
with	1
a	1
certain	1
studious	1
interest,	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
verbal	1
courtesies;	1
he	1
lit	1
his	1
pipe	1
and	1
blew	1
great	1
clouds	1
out	1
of	1
it.	1
"Yes,"	1
he	1
resumed.	1
"The	1
matter	1
on	1
which	1
you	1
and	1
I	1
are	1
engaged	1
is	1
at	1
this	1
moment	1
really	1
the	1
best	1
copy	1
in	1
England.	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
journalist,	1
and	1
I	1
know.	1
For	1
the	1
first	1
time,	1
perhaps,	1
for	1
many	1
generations,	1
the	1
English	1
are	1
really	1
more	1
angry	1
about	1
a	1
wrong	1
thing	1
done	1
in	1
England	1
than	1
they	1
are	1
about	1
a	1
wrong	1
thing	1
done	1
in	1
France."	1
"It	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
wrong	1
thing,"	1
said	1
MacIan.	1
Turnbull	1
laughed.	1
"You	1
seem	1
unable	1
to	1
understand	1
the	1
ordinary	1
use	1
of	1
the	1
human	1
language.	1
If	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
suspect	1
that	1
you	1
were	1
a	1
genius,	1
I	1
should	1
certainly	1
know	1
you	1
were	1
a	1
blockhead.	1
I	1
fancy	1
we	1
had	1
better	1
be	1
getting	1
along	1
and	1
collecting	1
our	1
baggage."	1
And	1
he	1
jumped	1
up	1
and	1
began	1
shoving	1
the	1
luggage	1
into	1
his	1
pockets,	1
or	1
strapping	1
it	1
on	1
to	1
his	1
back.	1
As	1
he	1
thrust	1
a	1
tin	1
of	1
canned	1
meat,	1
anyhow,	1
into	1
his	1
bursting	1
side	1
pocket,	1
he	1
said	1
casually:	1
"I	1
only	1
meant	1
that	1
you	1
and	1
I	1
are	1
the	1
most	1
prominent	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
English	1
papers."	1
"Well,	1
what	1
did	1
you	1
expect?"	1
asked	1
MacIan,	1
opening	1
his	1
great	1
grave	1
blue	1
eyes.	1
"The	1
papers	1
are	1
full	1
of	1
us,"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
stooping	1
to	1
pick	1
up	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
swords.	1
MacIan	1
stooped	1
and	1
picked	1
up	1
the	1
other.	1
"Yes,"	1
he	1
said,	1
in	1
his	1
simple	1
way.	1
"I	1
have	1
read	1
what	1
they	1
have	1
to	1
say.	1
But	1
they	1
don't	1
seem	1
to	1
understand	1
the	1
point."	1
"The	1
point	1
of	1
what?"	1
asked	1
Turnbull.	1
"The	1
point	1
of	1
the	1
sword,"	1
said	1
MacIan,	1
violently,	1
and	1
planted	1
the	1
steel	1
point	1
in	1
the	1
soil	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
planting	1
a	1
tree.	1
"That	1
is	1
a	1
point,"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
grimly,	1
"that	1
we	1
will	1
discuss	1
later.	1
Come	1
along."	1
Turnbull	1
tied	1
the	1
last	1
tin	1
of	1
biscuits	1
desperately	1
to	1
himself	1
with	1
string;	1
and	1
then	1
spoke,	1
like	1
a	1
diver	1
girt	1
for	1
plunging,	1
short	1
and	1
sharp.	1
"Now,	1
Mr.	1
MacIan,	1
you	1
must	1
listen	1
to	1
me.	1
You	1
must	1
listen	1
to	1
me,	1
not	1
merely	1
because	1
I	1
know	1
the	1
country,	1
which	1
you	1
might	1
learn	1
by	1
looking	1
at	1
a	1
map,	1
but	1
because	1
I	1
know	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
country,	1
whom	1
you	1
could	1
not	1
know	1
by	1
living	1
here	1
thirty	1
years.	1
That	1
infernal	1
city	1
down	1
there	1
is	1
awake;	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
awake	1
against	1
us.	1
All	1
those	1
endless	1
rows	1
of	1
windows	1
and	1
windows	1
are	1
all	1
eyes	1
staring	1
at	1
us.	1
All	1
those	1
forests	1
of	1
chimneys	1
are	1
fingers	1
pointing	1
at	1
us,	1
as	1
we	1
stand	1
here	1
on	1
the	1
hillside.	1
This	1
thing	1
has	1
caught	1
on.	1
For	1
the	1
next	1
six	1
mortal	1
months	1
they	1
will	1
think	1
of	1
nothing	1
but	1
us,	1
as	1
for	1
six	1
mortal	1
months	1
they	1
thought	1
of	1
nothing	1
but	1
the	1
Dreyfus	1
case.	1
Oh,	1
I	1
know	1
it's	1
funny.	1
They	1
let	1
starving	1
children,	1
who	1
don't	1
want	1
to	1
die,	1
drop	1
by	1
the	1
score	1
without	1
looking	1
round.	1
But	1
because	1
two	1
gentlemen,	1
from	1
private	1
feelings	1
of	1
delicacy,	1
do	1
want	1
to	1
die,	1
they	1
will	1
mobilize	1
the	1
army	1
and	1
navy	1
to	1
prevent	1
them.	1
For	1
half	1
a	1
year	1
or	1
more,	1
you	1
and	1
I,	1
Mr.	1
MacIan,	1
will	1
be	1
an	1
obstacle	1
to	1
every	1
reform	1
in	1
the	1
British	1
Empire.	1
We	1
shall	1
prevent	1
the	1
Chinese	1
being	1
sent	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
Transvaal	1
and	1
the	1
blocks	1
being	1
stopped	1
in	1
the	1
Strand.	1
We	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
conversational	1
substitute	1
when	1
anyone	1
recommends	1
Home	1
Rule,	1
or	1
complains	1
of	1
sky	1
signs.	1
Therefore,	1
do	1
not	1
imagine,	1
in	1
your	1
innocence,	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
only	1
to	1
melt	1
away	1
among	1
those	1
English	1
hills	1
as	1
a	1
Highland	1
cateran	1
might	1
into	1
your	1
god-forsaken	1
Highland	1
mountains.	1
We	1
must	1
be	1
eternally	1
on	1
our	1
guard;	1
we	1
must	1
live	1
the	1
hunted	1
life	1
of	1
two	1
distinguished	1
criminals.	1
We	1
must	1
expect	1
to	1
be	1
recognized	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
if	1
we	1
were	1
Napoleon	1
escaping	1
from	1
Elba.	1
We	1
must	1
be	1
prepared	1
for	1
our	1
descriptions	1
being	1
sent	1
to	1
every	1
tiny	1
village,	1
and	1
for	1
our	1
faces	1
being	1
recognized	1
by	1
every	1
ambitious	1
policeman.	1
We	1
must	1
often	1
sleep	1
under	1
the	1
stars	1
as	1
if	1
we	1
were	1
in	1
Africa.	1
Last	1
and	1
most	1
important	1
we	1
must	1
not	1
dream	1
of	1
effecting	1
our--our	1
final	1
settlement,	1
which	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
thing	1
as	1
famous	1
as	1
the	1
Phoenix	1
Park	1
murders,	1
unless	1
we	1
have	1
made	1
real	1
and	1
precise	1
arrangements	1
for	1
our	1
isolation--I	1
will	1
not	1
say	1
our	1
safety.	1
We	1
must	1
not,	1
in	1
short,	1
fight	1
until	1
we	1
have	1
thrown	1
them	1
off	1
our	1
scent,	1
if	1
only	1
for	1
a	1
moment.	1
For,	1
take	1
my	1
word	1
for	1
it,	1
Mr.	1
MacIan,	1
if	1
the	1
British	1
Public	1
once	1
catches	1
us	1
up,	1
the	1
British	1
Public	1
will	1
prevent	1
the	1
duel,	1
if	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
by	1
locking	1
us	1
both	1
up	1
in	1
asylums	1
for	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
our	1
days."	1
MacIan	1
was	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
horizon	1
with	1
a	1
rather	1
misty	1
look.	1
"I	1
am	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
surprised,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"at	1
the	1
world	1
being	1
against	1
us.	1
It	1
makes	1
me	1
feel	1
I	1
was	1
right	1
to----"	1
"Yes?"	1
said	1
Turnbull.	1
"To	1
smash	1
your	1
window,"	1
said	1
MacIan.	1
"I	1
have	1
woken	1
up	1
the	1
world."	1
"Very	1
well,	1
then,"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
stolidly.	1
"Let	1
us	1
look	1
at	1
a	1
few	1
final	1
facts.	1
Beyond	1
that	1
hill	1
there	1
is	1
comparatively	1
clear	1
country.	1
Fortunately,	1
I	1
know	1
the	1
part	1
well,	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
follow	1
me	1
exactly,	1
and,	1
when	1
necessary,	1
on	1
your	1
stomach,	1
we	1
may	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
get	1
ten	1
miles	1
out	1
of	1
London,	1
literally	1
without	1
meeting	1
anyone	1
at	1
all,	1
which	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
best	1
possible	1
beginning,	1
at	1
any	1
rate.	1
We	1
have	1
provisions	1
for	1
at	1
least	1
two	1
days	1
and	1
two	1
nights,	1
three	1
days	1
if	1
we	1
do	1
it	1
carefully.	1
We	1
may	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
get	1
fifty	1
or	1
sixty	1
miles	1
away	1
without	1
even	1
walking	1
into	1
an	1
inn	1
door.	1
I	1
have	1
the	1
biscuits	1
and	1
the	1
tinned	1
meat,	1
and	1
the	1
milk.	1
You	1
have	1
the	1
chocolate,	1
I	1
think?	1
And	1
the	1
brandy?"	1
"Yes,"	1
said	1
MacIan,	1
like	1
a	1
soldier	1
taking	1
orders.	1
"Very	1
well,	1
then,	1
come	1
on.	1
March.	1
We	1
turn	1
under	1
that	1
third	1
bush	1
and	1
so	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
valley."	1
And	1
he	1
set	1
off	1
ahead	1
at	1
a	1
swinging	1
walk.	1
Then	1
he	1
stopped	1
suddenly;	1
for	1
he	1
realized	1
that	1
the	1
other	1
was	1
not	1
following.	1
Evan	1
MacIan	1
was	1
leaning	1
on	1
his	1
sword	1
with	1
a	1
lowering	1
face,	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
suddenly	1
smitten	1
still	1
with	1
doubt.	1
"What	1
on	1
earth	1
is	1
the	1
matter?"	1
asked	1
Turnbull,	1
staring	1
in	1
some	1
anger.	1
Evan	1
made	1
no	1
reply.	1
"What	1
the	1
deuce	1
is	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
you?"	1
demanded	1
the	1
leader,	1
again,	1
his	1
face	1
slowly	1
growing	1
as	1
red	1
as	1
his	1
beard;	1
then	1
he	1
said,	1
suddenly,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
more	1
human	1
voice,	1
"Are	1
you	1
in	1
pain,	1
MacIan?"	1
"Yes,"	1
replied	1
the	1
Highlander,	1
without	1
lifting	1
his	1
face.	1
"Take	1
some	1
brandy,"	1
cried	1
Turnbull,	1
walking	1
forward	1
hurriedly	1
towards	1
him.	1
"You've	1
got	1
it."	1
"It's	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
body,"	1
said	1
MacIan,	1
in	1
his	1
dull,	1
strange	1
way.	1
"The	1
pain	1
has	1
come	1
into	1
my	1
mind.	1
A	1
very	1
dreadful	1
thing	1
has	1
just	1
come	1
into	1
my	1
thoughts."	1
"What	1
the	1
devil	1
are	1
you	1
talking	1
about?"	1
asked	1
Turnbull.	1
MacIan	1
broke	1
out	1
with	1
a	1
queer	1
and	1
living	1
voice.	1
"We	1
must	1
fight	1
now,	1
Turnbull.	1
We	1
must	1
fight	1
now.	1
A	1
frightful	1
thing	1
has	1
come	1
upon	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
now	1
and	1
here.	1
I	1
must	1
kill	1
you	1
here,"	1
he	1
cried,	1
with	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
tearful	1
rage	1
impossible	1
to	1
describe.	1
"Here,	1
here,	1
upon	1
this	1
blessed	1
grass."	1
"Why,	1
you	1
idiot,"	1
began	1
Turnbull.	1
"The	1
hour	1
has	1
come--the	1
black	1
hour	1
God	1
meant	1
for	1
it.	1
Quick,	1
it	1
will	1
soon	1
be	1
gone.	1
Quick!"	1
And	1
he	1
flung	1
the	1
scabbard	1
from	1
him	1
furiously,	1
and	1
stood	1
with	1
the	1
sunlight	1
sparkling	1
along	1
his	1
sword.	1
"You	1
confounded	1
fool,"	1
repeated	1
Turnbull.	1
"Put	1
that	1
thing	1
up	1
again,	1
you	1
ass;	1
people	1
will	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
that	1
house	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
clash	1
of	1
the	1
steel."	1
"One	1
of	1
us	1
will	1
be	1
dead	1
before	1
they	1
come,"	1
said	1
the	1
other,	1
hoarsely,	1
"for	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
hour	1
God	1
meant."	1
"Well,	1
I	1
never	1
thought	1
much	1
of	1
God,"	1
said	1
the	1
editor	1
of	1
_The	1
Atheist_,	1
losing	1
all	1
patience.	1
"And	1
I	1
think	1
less	1
now.	1
Never	1
mind	1
what	1
God	1
meant.	1
Kindly	1
enlighten	1
my	1
pagan	1
darkness	1
as	1
to	1
what	1
the	1
devil	1
_you_	1
mean."	1
"The	1
hour	1
will	1
soon	1
be	1
gone.	1
In	1
a	1
moment	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
gone,"	1
said	1
the	1
madman.	1
"It	1
is	1
now,	1
now,	1
now	1
that	1
I	1
must	1
nail	1
your	1
blaspheming	1
body	1
to	1
the	1
earth--now,	1
now	1
that	1
I	1
must	1
avenge	1
Our	1
Lady	1
on	1
her	1
vile	1
slanderer.	1
Now	1
or	1
never.	1
For	1
the	1
dreadful	1
thought	1
is	1
in	1
my	1
mind."	1
"And	1
what	1
thought,"	1
asked	1
Turnbull,	1
with	1
frantic	1
composure,	1
"occupies	1
what	1
you	1
call	1
your	1
mind?"	1
"I	1
must	1
kill	1
you	1
now,"	1
said	1
the	1
fanatic,	1
"because----"	1
"Well,	1
because,"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
patiently.	1
"Because	1
I	1
have	1
begun	1
to	1
like	1
you."	1
Turnbull's	1
face	1
had	1
a	1
sudden	1
spasm	1
in	1
the	1
sunlight,	1
a	1
change	1
so	1
instantaneous	1
that	1
it	1
left	1
no	1
trace	1
behind	1
it;	1
and	1
his	1
features	1
seemed	1
still	1
carved	1
into	1
a	1
cold	1
stare.	1
But	1
when	1
he	1
spoke	1
again	1
he	1
seemed	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
was	1
placidly	1
pretending	1
to	1
misunderstand	1
something	1
that	1
he	1
understood	1
perfectly	1
well.	1
"Your	1
affection	1
expresses	1
itself	1
in	1
an	1
abrupt	1
form,"	1
he	1
began,	1
but	1
MacIan	1
broke	1
the	1
brittle	1
and	1
frivolous	1
speech	1
to	1
pieces	1
with	1
a	1
violent	1
voice.	1
"Do	1
not	1
trouble	1
to	1
talk	1
like	1
that,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"You	1
know	1
what	1
I	1
mean	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
I	1
know	1
it.	1
Come	1
on	1
and	1
fight,	1
I	1
say.	1
Perhaps	1
you	1
are	1
feeling	1
just	1
as	1
I	1
do."	1
Turnbull's	1
face	1
flinched	1
again	1
in	1
the	1
fierce	1
sunlight,	1
but	1
his	1
attitude	1
kept	1
its	1
contemptuous	1
ease.	1
"Your	1
Celtic	1
mind	1
really	1
goes	1
too	1
fast	1
for	1
me,"	1
he	1
said;	1
"let	1
me	1
be	1
permitted	1
in	1
my	1
heavy	1
Lowland	1
way	1
to	1
understand	1
this	1
new	1
development.	1
My	1
dear	1
Mr.	1
MacIan,	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
really	1
mean?"	1
MacIan	1
still	1
kept	1
the	1
shining	1
sword-point	1
towards	1
the	1
other's	1
breast.	1
"You	1
know	1
what	1
I	1
mean.	1
You	1
mean	1
the	1
same	1
yourself.	1
We	1
must	1
fight	1
now	1
or	1
else----"	1
"Or	1
else?"	1
repeated	1
Turnbull,	1
staring	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
an	1
almost	1
blinding	1
gravity.	1
"Or	1
else	1
we	1
may	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
fight	1
at	1
all,"	1
answered	1
Evan,	1
and	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
his	1
speech	1
was	1
like	1
a	1
despairing	1
cry.	1
Turnbull	1
took	1
out	1
his	1
own	1
sword	1
suddenly	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
engage;	1
then	1
planting	1
it	1
point	1
downwards	1
for	1
a	1
moment,	1
he	1
said,	1
"Before	1
we	1
begin,	1
may	1
I	1
ask	1
you	1
a	1
question?"	1
MacIan	1
bowed	1
patiently,	1
but	1
with	1
burning	1
eyes.	1
"You	1
said,	1
just	1
now,"	1
continued	1
Turnbull,	1
presently,	1
"that	1
if	1
we	1
did	1
not	1
fight	1
now,	1
we	1
might	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
fight	1
at	1
all.	1
How	1
would	1
you	1
feel	1
about	1
the	1
matter	1
if	1
we	1
came	1
not	1
to	1
want	1
to	1
fight	1
at	1
all?"	1
"I	1
should	1
feel,"	1
answered	1
the	1
other,	1
"just	1
as	1
I	1
should	1
feel	1
if	1
you	1
had	1
drawn	1
your	1
sword,	1
and	1
I	1
had	1
run	1
away	1
from	1
it.	1
I	1
should	1
feel	1
that	1
because	1
I	1
had	1
been	1
weak,	1
justice	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
done."	1
"Justice,"	1
answered	1
Turnbull,	1
with	1
a	1
thoughtful	1
smile,	1
"but	1
we	1
are	1
talking	1
about	1
your	1
feelings.	1
And	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
mean	1
by	1
justice,	1
apart	1
from	1
your	1
feelings?"	1
MacIan	1
made	1
a	1
gesture	1
of	1
weary	1
recognition!	1
"Oh,	1
Nominalism,"	1
he	1
said,	1
with	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
sigh,	1
"we	1
had	1
all	1
that	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
twelfth	1
century."	1
"I	1
wish	1
we	1
could	1
have	1
it	1
out	1
now,"	1
replied	1
the	1
other,	1
firmly.	1
"Do	1
you	1
really	1
mean	1
that	1
if	1
you	1
came	1
to	1
think	1
me	1
right,	1
you	1
would	1
be	1
certainly	1
wrong?"	1
"If	1
I	1
had	1
a	1
blow	1
on	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
my	1
head,	1
I	1
might	1
come	1
to	1
think	1
you	1
a	1
green	1
elephant,"	1
answered	1
MacIan,	1
"but	1
have	1
I	1
not	1
the	1
right	1
to	1
say	1
now,	1
that	1
if	1
I	1
thought	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
think	1
wrong?"	1
"Then	1
you	1
are	1
quite	1
certain	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
wrong	1
to	1
like	1
me?"	1
asked	1
Turnbull,	1
with	1
a	1
slight	1
smile.	1
"No,"	1
said	1
Evan,	1
thoughtfully,	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
say	1
that.	1
It	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
the	1
devil,	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
some	1
part	1
of	1
God	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
meant	1
to	1
know.	1
But	1
I	1
had	1
a	1
work	1
to	1
do,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
making	1
the	1
work	1
difficult."	1
"And	1
I	1
suppose,"	1
said	1
the	1
atheist,	1
quite	1
gently,	1
"that	1
you	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
all	1
about	1
which	1
part	1
of	1
God	1
we	1
ought	1
to	1
know."	1
MacIan	1
burst	1
out	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
driven	1
back	1
and	1
explaining	1
everything.	1
"The	1
Church	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
thing	1
like	1
the	1
Athenaeum	1
Club,"	1
he	1
cried.	1
"If	1
the	1
Athenaeum	1
Club	1
lost	1
all	1
its	1
members,	1
the	1
Athenaeum	1
Club	1
would	1
dissolve	1
and	1
cease	1
to	1
exist.	1
But	1
when	1
we	1
belong	1
to	1
the	1
Church	1
we	1
belong	1
to	1
something	1
which	1
is	1
outside	1
all	1
of	1
us;	1
which	1
is	1
outside	1
everything	1
you	1
talk	1
about,	1
outside	1
the	1
Cardinals	1
and	1
the	1
Pope.	1
They	1
belong	1
to	1
it,	1
but	1
it	1
does	1
not	1
belong	1
to	1
them.	1
If	1
we	1
all	1
fell	1
dead	1
suddenly,	1
the	1
Church	1
would	1
still	1
somehow	1
exist	1
in	1
God.	1
Confound	1
it	1
all,	1
don't	1
you	1
see	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
more	1
sure	1
of	1
its	1
existence	1
than	1
I	1
am	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
existence?	1
And	1
yet	1
you	1
ask	1
me	1
to	1
trust	1
my	1
temperament,	1
my	1
own	1
temperament,	1
which	1
can	1
be	1
turned	1
upside	1
down	1
by	1
two	1
bottles	1
of	1
claret	1
or	1
an	1
attack	1
of	1
the	1
jaundice.	1
You	1
ask	1
me	1
to	1
trust	1
that	1
when	1
it	1
softens	1
towards	1
you	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
trust	1
the	1
thing	1
which	1
I	1
believe	1
to	1
be	1
outside	1
myself	1
and	1
more	1
real	1
than	1
the	1
blood	1
in	1
my	1
body."	1
"Stop	1
a	1
moment,"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
easy	1
tone,	1
"Even	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
act	1
of	1
saying	1
that	1
you	1
believe	1
this	1
or	1
that,	1
you	1
imply	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
yourself	1
that	1
you	1
trust	1
even	1
if	1
there	1
are	1
many	1
parts	1
which	1
you	1
mistrust.	1
If	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
you	1
that	1
like	1
me,	1
surely,	1
also,	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
you	1
that	1
believe	1
in	1
the	1
Catholic	1
Church."	1
Evan	1
remained	1
in	1
an	1
unmoved	1
and	1
grave	1
attitude.	1
"There	1
is	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
me	1
which	1
is	1
divine,"	1
he	1
answered,	1
"a	1
part	1
that	1
can	1
be	1
trusted,	1
but	1
there	1
are	1
also	1
affections	1
which	1
are	1
entirely	1
animal	1
and	1
idle."	1
"And	1
you	1
are	1
quite	1
certain,	1
I	1
suppose,"	1
continued	1
Turnbull,	1
"that	1
if	1
even	1
you	1
esteem	1
me	1
the	1
esteem	1
would	1
be	1
wholly	1
animal	1
and	1
idle?"	1
For	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
MacIan	1
started	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
expected	1
the	1
thing	1
that	1
was	1
said	1
to	1
him.	1
At	1
last	1
he	1
said:	1
"Whatever	1
in	1
earth	1
or	1
heaven	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
has	1
joined	1
us	1
two	1
together,	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
something	1
which	1
makes	1
it	1
impossible	1
to	1
lie.	1
No,	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
that	1
the	1
movement	1
in	1
me	1
towards	1
you	1
was...was	1
that	1
surface	1
sort	1
of	1
thing.	1
It	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
something	1
deeper...something	1
strange.	1
I	1
cannot	1
understand	1
the	1
thing	1
at	1
all.	1
But	1
understand	1
this	1
and	1
understand	1
it	1
thoroughly,	1
if	1
I	1
loved	1
you	1
my	1
love	1
might	1
be	1
divine.	1
No,	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
some	1
trifle	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
fighting	1
about.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
some	1
superstition	1
or	1
some	1
symbol.	1
When	1
you	1
wrote	1
those	1
words	1
about	1
Our	1
Lady,	1
you	1
were	1
in	1
that	1
act	1
a	1
wicked	1
man	1
doing	1
a	1
wicked	1
thing.	1
If	1
I	1
hate	1
you	1
it	1
is	1
because	1
you	1
have	1
hated	1
goodness.	1
And	1
if	1
I	1
like	1
you...it	1
is	1
because	1
you	1
are	1
good."	1
Turnbull's	1
face	1
wore	1
an	1
indecipherable	1
expression.	1
"Well,	1
shall	1
we	1
fight	1
now?"	1
he	1
said.	1
"Yes,"	1
said	1
MacIan,	1
with	1
a	1
sudden	1
contraction	1
of	1
his	1
black	1
brows,	1
"yes,	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
now."	1
The	1
bright	1
swords	1
crossed,	1
and	1
the	1
first	1
touch	1
of	1
them,	1
travelling	1
down	1
blade	1
and	1
arm,	1
told	1
each	1
combatant	1
that	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
was	1
awakened.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
that	1
way	1
that	1
the	1
swords	1
rang	1
together	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
rushed	1
on	1
each	1
other	1
in	1
the	1
little	1
garden	1
behind	1
the	1
dealer's	1
shop.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
pause,	1
and	1
then	1
MacIan	1
made	1
a	1
movement	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
thrust,	1
and	1
almost	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
moment	1
Turnbull	1
suddenly	1
and	1
calmly	1
dropped	1
his	1
sword.	1
Evan	1
stared	1
round	1
in	1
an	1
unusual	1
bewilderment,	1
and	1
then	1
realized	1
that	1
a	1
large	1
man	1
in	1
pale	1
clothes	1
and	1
a	1
Panama	1
hat	1
was	1
strolling	1
serenely	1
towards	1
them.	1
V.	1
THE	1
PEACEMAKER	1
When	1
the	1
combatants,	1
with	1
crossed	1
swords,	1
became	1
suddenly	1
conscious	1
of	1
a	1
third	1
party,	1
they	1
each	1
made	1
the	1
same	1
movement.	1
It	1
was	1
as	1
quick	1
as	1
the	1
snap	1
of	1
a	1
pistol,	1
and	1
they	1
altered	1
it	1
instantaneously	1
and	1
recovered	1
their	1
original	1
pose,	1
but	1
they	1
had	1
both	1
made	1
it,	1
they	1
had	1
both	1
seen	1
it,	1
and	1
they	1
both	1
knew	1
what	1
it	1
was.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
movement	1
of	1
anger	1
at	1
being	1
interrupted.	1
Say	1
or	1
think	1
what	1
they	1
would,	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
movement	1
of	1
relief.	1
A	1
force	1
within	1
them,	1
and	1
yet	1
quite	1
beyond	1
them,	1
seemed	1
slowly	1
and	1
pitilessly	1
washing	1
away	1
the	1
adamant	1
of	1
their	1
oath.	1
As	1
mistaken	1
lovers	1
might	1
watch	1
the	1
inevitable	1
sunset	1
of	1
first	1
love,	1
these	1
men	1
watched	1
the	1
sunset	1
of	1
their	1
first	1
hatred.	1
Their	1
hearts	1
were	1
growing	1
weaker	1
and	1
weaker	1
against	1
each	1
other.	1
When	1
their	1
weapons	1
rang	1
and	1
riposted	1
in	1
the	1
little	1
London	1
garden,	1
they	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
very	1
certain	1
that	1
if	1
a	1
third	1
party	1
had	1
interrupted	1
them	1
something	1
at	1
least	1
would	1
have	1
happened.	1
They	1
would	1
have	1
killed	1
each	1
other	1
or	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
killed	1
him.	1
But	1
now	1
nothing	1
could	1
undo	1
or	1
deny	1
that	1
flash	1
of	1
fact,	1
that	1
for	1
a	1
second	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
glad	1
to	1
be	1
interrupted.	1
Some	1
new	1
and	1
strange	1
thing	1
was	1
rising	1
higher	1
and	1
higher	1
in	1
their	1
hearts	1
like	1
a	1
high	1
sea	1
at	1
night.	1
It	1
was	1
something	1
that	1
seemed	1
all	1
the	1
more	1
merciless,	1
because	1
it	1
might	1
turn	1
out	1
an	1
enormous	1
mercy.	1
Was	1
there,	1
perhaps,	1
some	1
such	1
fatalism	1
in	1
friendship	1
as	1
all	1
lovers	1
talk	1
about	1
in	1
love?	1
Did	1
God	1
make	1
men	1
love	1
each	1
other	1
against	1
their	1
will?	1
"I'm	1
sure	1
you'll	1
excuse	1
my	1
speaking	1
to	1
you,"	1
said	1
the	1
stranger,	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
at	1
once	1
eager	1
and	1
deprecating.	1
The	1
voice	1
was	1
too	1
polite	1
for	1
good	1
manners.	1
It	1
was	1
incongruous	1
with	1
the	1
eccentric	1
spectacle	1
of	1
the	1
duellists	1
which	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
startled	1
a	1
sane	1
and	1
free	1
man.	1
It	1
was	1
also	1
incongruous	1
with	1
the	1
full	1
and	1
healthy,	1
though	1
rather	1
loose	1
physique	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
spoke.	1
At	1
the	1
first	1
glance	1
he	1
looked	1
a	1
fine	1
animal,	1
with	1
curling	1
gold	1
beard	1
and	1
hair,	1
and	1
blue	1
eyes,	1
unusually	1
bright.	1
It	1
was	1
only	1
at	1
the	1
second	1
glance	1
that	1
the	1
mind	1
felt	1
a	1
sudden	1
and	1
perhaps	1
unmeaning	1
irritation	1
at	1
the	1
way	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
gold	1
beard	1
retreated	1
backwards	1
into	1
the	1
waistcoat,	1
and	1
the	1
way	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
finely	1
shaped	1
nose	1
went	1
forward	1
as	1
if	1
smelling	1
its	1
way.	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
only,	1
perhaps,	1
at	1
the	1
hundredth	1
glance	1
that	1
the	1
bright	1
blue	1
eyes,	1
which	1
normally	1
before	1
and	1
after	1
the	1
instant	1
seemed	1
brilliant	1
with	1
intelligence,	1
seemed	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
brilliant	1
with	1
idiocy.	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
heavy,	1
healthy-looking	1
man,	1
who	1
looked	1
all	1
the	1
larger	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
loose,	1
light	1
coloured	1
clothes	1
that	1
he	1
wore,	1
and	1
that	1
had	1
in	1
their	1
extreme	1
lightness	1
and	1
looseness,	1
almost	1
a	1
touch	1
of	1
the	1
tropics.	1
But	1
a	1
closer	1
examination	1
of	1
his	1
attire	1
would	1
have	1
shown	1
that	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
tropics	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
unique;	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
woven	1
according	1
to	1
some	1
hygienic	1
texture	1
which	1
no	1
human	1
being	1
had	1
ever	1
heard	1
of	1
before,	1
and	1
which	1
was	1
absolutely	1
necessary	1
even	1
for	1
a	1
day's	1
health.	1
He	1
wore	1
a	1
huge	1
broad-brimmed	1
hat,	1
equally	1
hygienic,	1
very	1
much	1
at	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
his	1
voice	1
coming	1
out	1
of	1
so	1
heavy	1
and	1
hearty	1
a	1
type	1
of	1
man	1
was,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
said,	1
startlingly	1
shrill	1
and	1
deferential.	1
"I'm	1
sure	1
you'll	1
excuse	1
my	1
speaking	1
to	1
you,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"Now,	1
I	1
wonder	1
if	1
you	1
are	1
in	1
some	1
little	1
difficulty	1
which,	1
after	1
all,	1
we	1
could	1
settle	1
very	1
comfortably	1
together?	1
Now,	1
you	1
don't	1
mind	1
my	1
saying	1
this,	1
do	1
you?"	1
The	1
face	1
of	1
both	1
combatants	1
remained	1
somewhat	1
solid	1
under	1
this	1
appeal.	1
But	1
the	1
stranger,	1
probably	1
taking	1
their	1
silence	1
for	1
a	1
gathering	1
shame,	1
continued	1
with	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
gaiety:	1
"So	1
you	1
are	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
I	1
have	1
read	1
about	1
in	1
the	1
papers.	1
Well,	1
of	1
course,	1
when	1
one	1
is	1
young,	1
one	1
is	1
rather	1
romantic.	1
Do	1
you	1
know	1
what	1
I	1
always	1
say	1
to	1
young	1
people?"	1
A	1
blank	1
silence	1
followed	1
this	1
gay	1
inquiry.	1
Then	1
Turnbull	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
colourless	1
voice:	1
"As	1
I	1
was	1
forty-seven	1
last	1
birthday,	1
I	1
probably	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
world	1
too	1
soon	1
for	1
the	1
experience."	1
"Very	1
good,	1
very	1
good,"	1
said	1
the	1
friendly	1
person.	1
"Dry	1
Scotch	1
humour.	1
Dry	1
Scotch	1
humour.	1
Well	1
now.	1
I	1
understand	1
that	1
you	1
two	1
people	1
want	1
to	1
fight	1
a	1
duel.	1
I	1
suppose	1
you	1
aren't	1
much	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
modern	1
world.	1
We've	1
quite	1
outgrown	1
duelling,	1
you	1
know.	1
In	1
fact,	1
Tolstoy	1
tells	1
us	1
that	1
we	1
shall	1
soon	1
outgrow	1
war,	1
which	1
he	1
says	1
is	1
simply	1
a	1
duel	1
between	1
nations.	1
A	1
duel	1
between	1
nations.	1
But	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
doubt	1
about	1
our	1
having	1
outgrown	1
duelling."	1
Waiting	1
for	1
some	1
effect	1
upon	1
his	1
wooden	1
auditors,	1
the	1
stranger	1
stood	1
beaming	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
and	1
then	1
resumed:	1
"Now,	1
they	1
tell	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
newspapers	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
really	1
wanting	1
to	1
fight	1
about	1
something	1
connected	1
with	1
Roman	1
Catholicism.	1
Now,	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
what	1
I	1
always	1
say	1
to	1
Roman	1
Catholics?"	1
"No,"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
heavily.	1
"Do	1
_they_?"	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
characteristic	1
of	1
the	1
hearty,	1
hygienic	1
gentleman	1
that	1
he	1
always	1
forgot	1
the	1
speech	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
the	1
moment	1
before.	1
Without	1
enlarging	1
further	1
on	1
the	1
fixed	1
form	1
of	1
his	1
appeal	1
to	1
the	1
Church	1
of	1
Rome,	1
he	1
laughed	1
cordially	1
at	1
Turnbull's	1
answer;	1
then	1
his	1
wandering	1
blue	1
eyes	1
caught	1
the	1
sunlight	1
on	1
the	1
swords,	1
and	1
he	1
assumed	1
a	1
good-humoured	1
gravity.	1
"But	1
you	1
know	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
serious	1
matter,"	1
he	1
said,	1
eyeing	1
Turnbull	1
and	1
MacIan,	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
just	1
been	1
keeping	1
the	1
table	1
in	1
a	1
roar	1
with	1
their	1
frivolities.	1
"I	1
am	1
sure	1
that	1
if	1
I	1
appealed	1
to	1
your	1
higher	1
natures...your	1
higher	1
natures.	1
Every	1
man	1
has	1
a	1
higher	1
nature	1
and	1
a	1
lower	1
nature.	1
Now,	1
let	1
us	1
put	1
the	1
matter	1
very	1
plainly,	1
and	1
without	1
any	1
romantic	1
nonsense	1
about	1
honour	1
or	1
anything	1
of	1
that	1
sort.	1
Is	1
not	1
bloodshed	1
a	1
great	1
sin?"	1
"No,"	1
said	1
MacIan,	1
speaking	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time.	1
"Well,	1
really,	1
really!"	1
said	1
the	1
peacemaker.	1
"Murder	1
is	1
a	1
sin,"	1
said	1
the	1
immovable	1
Highlander.	1
"There	1
is	1
no	1
sin	1
of	1
bloodshed."	1
"Well,	1
we	1
won't	1
quarrel	1
about	1
a	1
word,"	1
said	1
the	1
other,	1
pleasantly.	1
"Why	1
on	1
earth	1
not?"	1
said	1
MacIan,	1
with	1
a	1
sudden	1
asperity.	1
"Why	1
shouldn't	1
we	1
quarrel	1
about	1
a	1
word?	1
What	1
is	1
the	1
good	1
of	1
words	1
if	1
they	1
aren't	1
important	1
enough	1
to	1
quarrel	1
over?	1
Why	1
do	1
we	1
choose	1
one	1
word	1
more	1
than	1
another	1
if	1
there	1
isn't	1
any	1
difference	1
between	1
them?	1
If	1
you	1
called	1
a	1
woman	1
a	1
chimpanzee	1
instead	1
of	1
an	1
angel,	1
wouldn't	1
there	1
be	1
a	1
quarrel	1
about	1
a	1
word?	1
If	1
you're	1
not	1
going	1
to	1
argue	1
about	1
words,	1
what	1
are	1
you	1
going	1
to	1
argue	1
about?	1
Are	1
you	1
going	1
to	1
convey	1
your	1
meaning	1
to	1
me	1
by	1
moving	1
your	1
ears?	1
The	1
Church	1
and	1
the	1
heresies	1
always	1
used	1
to	1
fight	1
about	1
words,	1
because	1
they	1
are	1
the	1
only	1
things	1
worth	1
fighting	1
about.	1
I	1
say	1
that	1
murder	1
is	1
a	1
sin,	1
and	1
bloodshed	1
is	1
not,	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
as	1
much	1
difference	1
between	1
those	1
words	1
as	1
there	1
is	1
between	1
the	1
word	1
'yes'	1
and	1
the	1
word	1
'no';	1
or	1
rather	1
more	1
difference,	1
for	1
'yes'	1
and	1
'no',	1
at	1
least,	1
belong	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
category.	1
Murder	1
is	1
a	1
spiritual	1
incident.	1
Bloodshed	1
is	1
a	1
physical	1
incident.	1
A	1
surgeon	1
commits	1
bloodshed.	1
"Ah,	1
you're	1
a	1
casuist!"	1
said	1
the	1
large	1
man,	1
wagging	1
his	1
head.	1
"Now,	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
what	1
I	1
always	1
say	1
to	1
casuists...?"	1
MacIan	1
made	1
a	1
violent	1
gesture;	1
and	1
Turnbull	1
broke	1
into	1
open	1
laughter.	1
The	1
peacemaker	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
annoyed,	1
but	1
continued	1
in	1
unabated	1
enjoyment.	1
"Well,	1
well,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"let	1
us	1
get	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
point.	1
Now	1
Tolstoy	1
has	1
shown	1
that	1
force	1
is	1
no	1
remedy;	1
so	1
you	1
see	1
the	1
position	1
in	1
which	1
I	1
am	1
placed.	1
I	1
am	1
doing	1
my	1
best	1
to	1
stop	1
what	1
I'm	1
sure	1
you	1
won't	1
mind	1
my	1
calling	1
this	1
really	1
useless	1
violence,	1
this	1
really	1
quite	1
wrong	1
violence	1
of	1
yours.	1
But	1
it's	1
against	1
my	1
principles	1
to	1
call	1
in	1
the	1
police	1
against	1
you,	1
because	1
the	1
police	1
are	1
still	1
on	1
a	1
lower	1
moral	1
plane,	1
so	1
to	1
speak,	1
because,	1
in	1
short,	1
the	1
police	1
undoubtedly	1
sometimes	1
employ	1
force.	1
Tolstoy	1
has	1
shown	1
that	1
violence	1
merely	1
breeds	1
violence	1
in	1
the	1
person	1
towards	1
whom	1
it	1
is	1
used,	1
whereas	1
Love,	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
hand,	1
breeds	1
Love.	1
So	1
you	1
see	1
how	1
I	1
am	1
placed.	1
I	1
am	1
reduced	1
to	1
use	1
Love	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
stop	1
you.	1
I	1
am	1
obliged	1
to	1
use	1
Love."	1
He	1
gave	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
an	1
indescribable	1
sound	1
of	1
something	1
hard	1
and	1
heavy,	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
saying	1
"boots".	1
Turnbull	1
suddenly	1
gripped	1
his	1
sword	1
and	1
said,	1
shortly,	1
"I	1
see	1
how	1
you	1
are	1
placed	1
quite	1
well,	1
sir.	1
You	1
will	1
not	1
call	1
the	1
police.	1
Mr.	1
MacIan,	1
shall	1
we	1
engage?"	1
MacIan	1
plucked	1
his	1
sword	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
grass.	1
"I	1
must	1
and	1
will	1
stop	1
this	1
shocking	1
crime,"	1
cried	1
the	1
Tolstoian,	1
crimson	1
in	1
the	1
face.	1
"It	1
is	1
against	1
all	1
modern	1
ideas.	1
It	1
is	1
against	1
the	1
principle	1
of	1
love.	1
How	1
you,	1
sir,	1
who	1
pretend	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
Christian..."	1
MacIan	1
turned	1
upon	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
white	1
face	1
and	1
bitter	1
lip.	1
"Sir,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"talk	1
about	1
the	1
principle	1
of	1
love	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
you	1
like.	1
You	1
seem	1
to	1
me	1
colder	1
than	1
a	1
lump	1
of	1
stone;	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
willing	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
you	1
may	1
at	1
some	1
time	1
have	1
loved	1
a	1
cat,	1
or	1
a	1
dog,	1
or	1
a	1
child.	1
When	1
you	1
were	1
a	1
baby,	1
I	1
suppose	1
you	1
loved	1
your	1
mother.	1
Talk	1
about	1
love,	1
then,	1
till	1
the	1
world	1
is	1
sick	1
of	1
the	1
word.	1
But	1
don't	1
you	1
talk	1
about	1
Christianity.	1
Don't	1
you	1
dare	1
to	1
say	1
one	1
word,	1
white	1
or	1
black,	1
about	1
it.	1
Christianity	1
is,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
you	1
are	1
concerned,	1
a	1
horrible	1
mystery.	1
Keep	1
clear	1
of	1
it,	1
keep	1
silent	1
upon	1
it,	1
as	1
you	1
would	1
upon	1
an	1
abomination.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
thing	1
that	1
has	1
made	1
men	1
slay	1
and	1
torture	1
each	1
other;	1
and	1
you	1
will	1
never	1
know	1
why.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
thing	1
that	1
has	1
made	1
men	1
do	1
evil	1
that	1
good	1
might	1
come;	1
and	1
you	1
will	1
never	1
understand	1
the	1
evil,	1
let	1
alone	1
the	1
good.	1
Christianity	1
is	1
a	1
thing	1
that	1
could	1
only	1
make	1
you	1
vomit,	1
till	1
you	1
are	1
other	1
than	1
you	1
are.	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
justify	1
it	1
to	1
you	1
even	1
if	1
I	1
could.	1
Hate	1
it,	1
in	1
God's	1
name,	1
as	1
Turnbull	1
does,	1
who	1
is	1
a	1
man.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
monstrous	1
thing,	1
for	1
which	1
men	1
die.	1
And	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
stand	1
here	1
and	1
talk	1
about	1
love	1
for	1
another	1
ten	1
minutes	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
probable	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
see	1
a	1
man	1
die	1
for	1
it."	1
And	1
he	1
fell	1
on	1
guard.	1
Turnbull	1
was	1
busy	1
settling	1
something	1
loose	1
in	1
his	1
elaborate	1
hilt,	1
and	1
the	1
pause	1
was	1
broken	1
by	1
the	1
stranger.	1
"Suppose	1
I	1
call	1
the	1
police?"	1
he	1
said,	1
with	1
a	1
heated	1
face.	1
"And	1
deny	1
your	1
most	1
sacred	1
dogma,"	1
said	1
MacIan.	1
"Dogma!"	1
cried	1
the	1
man,	1
in	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
dismay.	1
"Oh,	1
we	1
have	1
no	1
_dogmas_,	1
you	1
know!"	1
There	1
was	1
another	1
silence,	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
again,	1
airily:	1
"You	1
know,	1
I	1
think,	1
there's	1
something	1
in	1
what	1
Shaw	1
teaches	1
about	1
no	1
moral	1
principles	1
being	1
quite	1
fixed.	1
Have	1
you	1
ever	1
read	1
_The	1
Quintessence	1
of	1
Ibsenism_?	1
Of	1
course	1
he	1
went	1
very	1
wrong	1
over	1
the	1
war."	1
Turnbull,	1
with	1
a	1
bent,	1
flushed	1
face,	1
was	1
tying	1
up	1
the	1
loose	1
piece	1
of	1
the	1
pommel	1
with	1
string.	1
With	1
the	1
string	1
in	1
his	1
teeth,	1
he	1
said,	1
"Oh,	1
make	1
up	1
your	1
damned	1
mind	1
and	1
clear	1
out!"	1
"It's	1
a	1
serious	1
thing,"	1
said	1
the	1
philosopher,	1
shaking	1
his	1
head.	1
"I	1
must	1
be	1
alone	1
and	1
consider	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
higher	1
point	1
of	1
view.	1
I	1
rather	1
feel	1
that	1
in	1
a	1
case	1
so	1
extreme	1
as	1
this..."	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
slowly	1
away.	1
As	1
he	1
disappeared	1
among	1
the	1
trees,	1
they	1
heard	1
him	1
murmuring	1
in	1
a	1
sing-song	1
voice,	1
"New	1
occasions	1
teach	1
new	1
duties,"	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
poem	1
by	1
James	1
Russell	1
Lowell.	1
"Ah,"	1
said	1
MacIan,	1
drawing	1
a	1
deep	1
breath.	1
"Don't	1
you	1
believe	1
in	1
prayer	1
now?	1
I	1
prayed	1
for	1
an	1
angel."	1
"An	1
hour	1
ago,"	1
said	1
the	1
Highlander,	1
in	1
his	1
heavy	1
meditative	1
voice,	1
"I	1
felt	1
the	1
devil	1
weakening	1
my	1
heart	1
and	1
my	1
oath	1
against	1
you,	1
and	1
I	1
prayed	1
that	1
God	1
would	1
send	1
an	1
angel	1
to	1
my	1
aid."	1
"Well?"	1
inquired	1
the	1
other,	1
finishing	1
his	1
mending	1
and	1
wrapping	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
string	1
round	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
firmer	1
grip.	1
"Well?"	1
"Well,	1
that	1
man	1
was	1
an	1
angel,"	1
said	1
MacIan.	1
"I	1
didn't	1
know	1
they	1
were	1
as	1
bad	1
as	1
that,"	1
answered	1
Turnbull.	1
"We	1
know	1
that	1
devils	1
sometimes	1
quote	1
Scripture	1
and	1
counterfeit	1
good,"	1
replied	1
the	1
mystic.	1
"Why	1
should	1
not	1
angels	1
sometimes	1
come	1
to	1
show	1
us	1
the	1
black	1
abyss	1
of	1
evil	1
on	1
whose	1
brink	1
we	1
stand.	1
If	1
that	1
man	1
had	1
not	1
tried	1
to	1
stop	1
us...I	1
might...I	1
might	1
have	1
stopped."	1
"I	1
know	1
what	1
you	1
mean,"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
grimly.	1
"But	1
then	1
he	1
came,"	1
broke	1
out	1
MacIan,	1
"and	1
my	1
soul	1
said	1
to	1
me:	1
'Give	1
up	1
fighting,	1
and	1
you	1
will	1
become	1
like	1
That.	1
Give	1
up	1
vows	1
and	1
dogmas,	1
and	1
fixed	1
things,	1
and	1
you	1
may	1
grow	1
like	1
That.	1
You	1
may	1
learn,	1
also,	1
that	1
fog	1
of	1
false	1
philosophy.	1
You	1
may	1
grow	1
fond	1
of	1
that	1
mire	1
of	1
crawling,	1
cowardly	1
morals,	1
and	1
you	1
may	1
come	1
to	1
think	1
a	1
blow	1
bad,	1
because	1
it	1
hurts,	1
and	1
not	1
because	1
it	1
humiliates.	1
You	1
may	1
come	1
to	1
think	1
murder	1
wrong,	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
violent,	1
and	1
not	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
unjust.	1
Oh,	1
you	1
blasphemer	1
of	1
the	1
good,	1
an	1
hour	1
ago	1
I	1
almost	1
loved	1
you!	1
But	1
do	1
not	1
fear	1
for	1
me	1
now.	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
the	1
word	1
Love	1
pronounced	1
in	1
_his_	1
intonation;	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
exactly	1
what	1
it	1
means.	1
On	1
guard!'"	1
The	1
swords	1
caught	1
on	1
each	1
other	1
with	1
a	1
dreadful	1
clang	1
and	1
jar,	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
energy	1
and	1
hate;	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
plunged	1
and	1
replunged.	1
Once	1
more	1
each	1
man's	1
heart	1
had	1
become	1
the	1
magnet	1
of	1
a	1
mad	1
sword.	1
Suddenly,	1
furious	1
as	1
they	1
were,	1
they	1
were	1
frozen	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
motionless.	1
"What	1
noise	1
is	1
that?"	1
asked	1
the	1
Highlander,	1
hoarsely.	1
"I	1
think	1
I	1
know,"	1
replied	1
Turnbull.	1
"What?...	1
What?"	1
cried	1
the	1
other.	1
"The	1
student	1
of	1
Shaw	1
and	1
Tolstoy	1
has	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
remarkable	1
mind,"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
quietly.	1
"The	1
police	1
are	1
coming	1
up	1
the	1
hill."	1
VI.	1
THE	1
OTHER	1
PHILOSOPHER	1
Between	1
high	1
hedges	1
in	1
Hertfordshire,	1
hedges	1
so	1
high	1
as	1
to	1
create	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
grove,	1
two	1
men	1
were	1
running.	1
They	1
did	1
not	1
run	1
in	1
a	1
scampering	1
or	1
feverish	1
manner,	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
steady	1
swing	1
of	1
the	1
pendulum.	1
Across	1
the	1
great	1
plains	1
and	1
uplands	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
and	1
left	1
of	1
the	1
lane,	1
a	1
long	1
tide	1
of	1
sunset	1
light	1
rolled	1
like	1
a	1
sea	1
of	1
ruby,	1
lighting	1
up	1
the	1
long	1
terraces	1
of	1
the	1
hills	1
and	1
picking	1
out	1
the	1
few	1
windows	1
of	1
the	1
scattered	1
hamlets	1
in	1
startling	1
blood-red	1
sparks.	1
But	1
the	1
lane	1
was	1
cut	1
deep	1
in	1
the	1
hill	1
and	1
remained	1
in	1
an	1
abrupt	1
shadow.	1
The	1
two	1
men	1
running	1
in	1
it	1
had	1
an	1
impression	1
not	1
uncommonly	1
experienced	1
between	1
those	1
wild	1
green	1
English	1
walls;	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
being	1
led	1
between	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
a	1
maze.	1
Though	1
their	1
pace	1
was	1
steady	1
it	1
was	1
vigorous;	1
their	1
faces	1
were	1
heated	1
and	1
their	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
and	1
bright.	1
There	1
was,	1
indeed,	1
something	1
a	1
little	1
mad	1
in	1
the	1
contrast	1
between	1
the	1
evening's	1
stillness	1
over	1
the	1
empty	1
country-side,	1
and	1
these	1
two	1
figures	1
fleeing	1
wildly	1
from	1
nothing.	1
They	1
had	1
the	1
look	1
of	1
two	1
lunatics,	1
possibly	1
they	1
were.	1
"Are	1
you	1
all	1
right?"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
with	1
civility.	1
"Can	1
you	1
keep	1
this	1
up?"	1
"Quite	1
easily,	1
thank	1
you,"	1
replied	1
MacIan.	1
"I	1
run	1
very	1
well."	1
"Is	1
that	1
a	1
qualification	1
in	1
a	1
family	1
of	1
warriors?"	1
asked	1
Turnbull.	1
"Undoubtedly.	1
Rapid	1
movement	1
is	1
essential,"	1
answered	1
MacIan,	1
who	1
never	1
saw	1
a	1
joke	1
in	1
his	1
life.	1
Turnbull	1
broke	1
out	1
into	1
a	1
short	1
laugh,	1
and	1
silence	1
fell	1
between	1
them,	1
the	1
panting	1
silence	1
of	1
runners.	1
Then	1
MacIan	1
said:	1
"We	1
run	1
better	1
than	1
any	1
of	1
those	1
policemen.	1
They	1
are	1
too	1
fat.	1
Why	1
do	1
you	1
make	1
your	1
policemen	1
so	1
fat?"	1
"I	1
didn't	1
do	1
much	1
towards	1
making	1
them	1
fat	1
myself,"	1
replied	1
Turnbull,	1
genially,	1
"but	1
I	1
flatter	1
myself	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
now	1
doing	1
something	1
towards	1
making	1
them	1
thin.	1
You'll	1
see	1
they	1
will	1
be	1
as	1
lean	1
as	1
rakes	1
by	1
the	1
time	1
they	1
catch	1
us.	1
They	1
will	1
look	1
like	1
your	1
friend,	1
Cardinal	1
Manning."	1
"But	1
they	1
won't	1
catch	1
us,"	1
said	1
MacIan,	1
in	1
his	1
literal	1
way.	1
"No,	1
we	1
beat	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
great	1
military	1
art	1
of	1
running	1
away,"	1
returned	1
the	1
other.	1
"They	1
won't	1
catch	1
us	1
unless----"	1
MacIan	1
turned	1
his	1
long	1
equine	1
face	1
inquiringly.	1
"Unless	1
what?"	1
he	1
said,	1
for	1
Turnbull	1
had	1
gone	1
silent	1
suddenly,	1
and	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
listening	1
intently	1
as	1
he	1
ran	1
as	1
a	1
horse	1
does	1
with	1
his	1
ears	1
turned	1
back.	1
"Unless	1
what?"	1
repeated	1
the	1
Highlander.	1
"Unless	1
they	1
do--what	1
they	1
have	1
done.	1
Listen."	1
MacIan	1
slackened	1
his	1
trot,	1
and	1
turned	1
his	1
head	1
to	1
the	1
trail	1
they	1
had	1
left	1
behind	1
them.	1
Across	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
billows	1
of	1
the	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
lane	1
came	1
along	1
the	1
ground	1
the	1
unmistakable	1
throbbing	1
of	1
horses'	1
hoofs.	1
"They	1
have	1
put	1
the	1
mounted	1
police	1
on	1
us,"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
shortly.	1
"Good	1
Lord,	1
one	1
would	1
think	1
we	1
were	1
a	1
Revolution."	1
"So	1
we	1
are,"	1
said	1
MacIan	1
calmly.	1
"What	1
shall	1
we	1
do?	1
Shall	1
we	1
turn	1
on	1
them	1
with	1
our	1
points?"	1
"It	1
may	1
come	1
to	1
that,"	1
answered	1
Turnbull,	1
"though	1
if	1
it	1
does,	1
I	1
reckon	1
that	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
last	1
act.	1
We	1
must	1
put	1
it	1
off	1
if	1
we	1
can."	1
And	1
he	1
stared	1
and	1
peered	1
about	1
him	1
between	1
the	1
bushes.	1
"If	1
we	1
could	1
hide	1
somewhere	1
the	1
beasts	1
might	1
go	1
by	1
us,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"The	1
police	1
have	1
their	1
faults,	1
but	1
thank	1
God	1
they're	1
inefficient.	1
Why,	1
here's	1
the	1
very	1
thing.	1
Be	1
quick	1
and	1
quiet.	1
Follow	1
me."	1
He	1
suddenly	1
swung	1
himself	1
up	1
the	1
high	1
bank	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
lane.	1
It	1
was	1
almost	1
as	1
high	1
and	1
smooth	1
as	1
a	1
wall,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
it	1
the	1
black	1
hedge	1
stood	1
out	1
over	1
them	1
as	1
an	1
angle,	1
almost	1
like	1
a	1
thatched	1
roof	1
of	1
the	1
lane.	1
And	1
the	1
burning	1
evening	1
sky	1
looked	1
down	1
at	1
them	1
through	1
the	1
tangle	1
with	1
red	1
eyes	1
as	1
of	1
an	1
army	1
of	1
goblins.	1
Turnbull	1
hoisted	1
himself	1
up	1
and	1
broke	1
the	1
hedge	1
with	1
his	1
body.	1
As	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
shoulders	1
rose	1
above	1
it	1
they	1
turned	1
to	1
flame	1
in	1
the	1
full	1
glow	1
as	1
if	1
lit	1
up	1
by	1
an	1
immense	1
firelight.	1
His	1
red	1
hair	1
and	1
beard	1
looked	1
almost	1
scarlet,	1
and	1
his	1
pale	1
face	1
as	1
bright	1
as	1
a	1
boy's.	1
Something	1
violent,	1
something	1
that	1
was	1
at	1
once	1
love	1
and	1
hatred,	1
surged	1
in	1
the	1
strange	1
heart	1
of	1
the	1
Gael	1
below	1
him.	1
He	1
had	1
an	1
unutterable	1
sense	1
of	1
epic	1
importance,	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
somehow	1
lifting	1
all	1
humanity	1
into	1
a	1
prouder	1
and	1
more	1
passionate	1
region	1
of	1
the	1
air.	1
As	1
he	1
swung	1
himself	1
up	1
also	1
into	1
the	1
evening	1
light	1
he	1
felt	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
rising	1
on	1
enormous	1
wings.	1
Legends	1
of	1
the	1
morning	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
in	1
childhood	1
or	1
read	1
in	1
youth	1
came	1
back	1
upon	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
cloudy	1
splendour,	1
purple	1
tales	1
of	1
wrath	1
and	1
friendship,	1
like	1
Roland	1
and	1
Oliver,	1
or	1
Balin	1
and	1
Balan,	1
reminding	1
him	1
of	1
emotional	1
entanglements.	1
Men	1
who	1
had	1
loved	1
each	1
other	1
and	1
then	1
fought	1
each	1
other;	1
men	1
who	1
had	1
fought	1
each	1
other	1
and	1
then	1
loved	1
each	1
other,	1
together	1
made	1
a	1
mixed	1
but	1
monstrous	1
sense	1
of	1
momentousness.	1
The	1
crimson	1
seas	1
of	1
the	1
sunset	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
like	1
a	1
bursting	1
out	1
of	1
some	1
sacred	1
blood,	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
had	1
broken.	1
Turnbull	1
was	1
wholly	1
unaffected	1
by	1
any	1
written	1
or	1
spoken	1
poetry;	1
his	1
was	1
a	1
powerful	1
and	1
prosaic	1
mind.	1
But	1
even	1
upon	1
him	1
there	1
came	1
for	1
the	1
moment	1
something	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
the	1
passionate	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
sky.	1
The	1
only	1
evidence	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
voice,	1
which	1
was	1
still	1
practical	1
but	1
a	1
shade	1
more	1
quiet.	1
"Do	1
you	1
see	1
that	1
summer-house-looking	1
thing	1
over	1
there?"	1
he	1
asked	1
shortly.	1
"That	1
will	1
do	1
for	1
us	1
very	1
well."	1
Keeping	1
himself	1
free	1
from	1
the	1
tangle	1
of	1
the	1
hedge	1
he	1
strolled	1
across	1
a	1
triangle	1
of	1
obscure	1
kitchen	1
garden,	1
and	1
approached	1
a	1
dismal	1
shed	1
or	1
lodge	1
a	1
yard	1
or	1
two	1
beyond	1
it.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
weather-stained	1
hut	1
of	1
grey	1
wood,	1
which	1
with	1
all	1
its	1
desolation	1
retained	1
a	1
tag	1
or	1
two	1
of	1
trivial	1
ornament,	1
which	1
suggested	1
that	1
the	1
thing	1
had	1
once	1
been	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
summer-house,	1
and	1
the	1
place	1
probably	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
garden.	1
"That	1
is	1
quite	1
invisible	1
from	1
the	1
road,"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
as	1
he	1
entered	1
it,	1
"and	1
it	1
will	1
cover	1
us	1
up	1
for	1
the	1
night."	1
MacIan	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
gravely	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
moments.	1
"Sir,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"I	1
ought	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
to	1
you.	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
say----"	1
"Hush,"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
suddenly	1
lifting	1
his	1
hand;	1
"be	1
still,	1
man."	1
In	1
the	1
sudden	1
silence,	1
the	1
drumming	1
of	1
the	1
distant	1
horses	1
grew	1
louder	1
and	1
louder	1
with	1
inconceivable	1
rapidity,	1
and	1
the	1
cavalcade	1
of	1
police	1
rushed	1
by	1
below	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
lane,	1
almost	1
with	1
the	1
roar	1
and	1
rattle	1
of	1
an	1
express	1
train.	1
"I	1
ought	1
to	1
tell	1
you,"	1
continued	1
MacIan,	1
still	1
staring	1
stolidly	1
at	1
the	1
other,	1
"that	1
you	1
are	1
a	1
great	1
chief,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
good	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
war	1
behind	1
you."	1
Turnbull	1
said	1
nothing,	1
but	1
turned	1
and	1
looked	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
foolish	1
lattice	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
windows,	1
then	1
he	1
said,	1
"We	1
must	1
have	1
food	1
and	1
sleep	1
first."	1
When	1
the	1
last	1
echo	1
of	1
their	1
eluded	1
pursuers	1
had	1
died	1
in	1
the	1
distant	1
uplands,	1
Turnbull	1
began	1
to	1
unpack	1
the	1
provisions	1
with	1
the	1
easy	1
air	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
at	1
a	1
picnic.	1
He	1
had	1
just	1
laid	1
out	1
the	1
last	1
items,	1
put	1
a	1
bottle	1
of	1
wine	1
on	1
the	1
floor,	1
and	1
a	1
tin	1
of	1
salmon	1
on	1
the	1
window-ledge,	1
when	1
the	1
bottomless	1
silence	1
of	1
that	1
forgotten	1
place	1
was	1
broken.	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
broken	1
by	1
three	1
heavy	1
blows	1
of	1
a	1
stick	1
delivered	1
upon	1
the	1
door.	1
Turnbull	1
looked	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
act	1
of	1
opening	1
a	1
tin	1
and	1
stared	1
silently	1
at	1
his	1
companion.	1
MacIan's	1
long,	1
lean	1
mouth	1
had	1
shut	1
hard.	1
"Who	1
the	1
devil	1
can	1
that	1
be?"	1
said	1
Turnbull.	1
"God	1
knows,"	1
said	1
the	1
other.	1
"It	1
might	1
be	1
God."	1
Again	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
wooden	1
stick	1
reverberated	1
on	1
the	1
wooden	1
door.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
curious	1
sound	1
and	1
on	1
consideration	1
did	1
not	1
resemble	1
the	1
ordinary	1
effects	1
of	1
knocking	1
on	1
a	1
door	1
for	1
admittance.	1
It	1
was	1
rather	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
a	1
stick	1
were	1
plunged	1
again	1
and	1
again	1
at	1
the	1
panels	1
in	1
an	1
absurd	1
attempt	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
hole	1
in	1
them.	1
A	1
wild	1
look	1
sprang	1
into	1
MacIan's	1
eyes	1
and	1
he	1
got	1
up	1
half	1
stupidly,	1
with	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
stagger,	1
put	1
his	1
hand	1
out	1
and	1
caught	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
swords.	1
"Let	1
us	1
fight	1
at	1
once,"	1
he	1
cried,	1
"it	1
is	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
world."	1
"You're	1
overdone,	1
MacIan,"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
putting	1
him	1
on	1
one	1
side.	1
"It's	1
only	1
someone	1
playing	1
the	1
goat.	1
Let	1
me	1
open	1
the	1
door."	1
But	1
he	1
also	1
picked	1
up	1
a	1
sword	1
as	1
he	1
stepped	1
to	1
open	1
it.	1
He	1
paused	1
one	1
moment	1
with	1
his	1
hand	1
on	1
the	1
handle	1
and	1
then	1
flung	1
the	1
door	1
open.	1
Almost	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
so	1
the	1
ferrule	1
of	1
an	1
ordinary	1
bamboo	1
cane	1
came	1
at	1
his	1
eyes,	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
actually	1
to	1
parry	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
naked	1
weapon	1
in	1
his	1
hands.	1
As	1
the	1
two	1
touched,	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
the	1
stick	1
was	1
dropped	1
very	1
abruptly,	1
and	1
the	1
man	1
with	1
the	1
stick	1
stepped	1
hurriedly	1
back.	1
Against	1
the	1
heraldic	1
background	1
of	1
sprawling	1
crimson	1
and	1
gold	1
offered	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
expiring	1
sunset,	1
the	1
figure	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
with	1
the	1
stick	1
showed	1
at	1
first	1
merely	1
black	1
and	1
fantastic.	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
small	1
man	1
with	1
two	1
wisps	1
of	1
long	1
hair	1
that	1
curled	1
up	1
on	1
each	1
side,	1
and	1
seen	1
in	1
silhouette,	1
looked	1
like	1
horns.	1
He	1
had	1
a	1
bow	1
tie	1
so	1
big	1
that	1
the	1
two	1
ends	1
showed	1
on	1
each	1
side	1
of	1
his	1
neck	1
like	1
unnatural	1
stunted	1
wings.	1
He	1
had	1
his	1
long	1
black	1
cane	1
still	1
tilted	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
like	1
a	1
fencing	1
foil	1
and	1
half	1
presented	1
at	1
the	1
open	1
door.	1
His	1
large	1
straw	1
hat	1
had	1
fallen	1
behind	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
leapt	1
backwards.	1
"With	1
reference	1
to	1
your	1
suggestion,	1
MacIan,"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
placidly,	1
"I	1
think	1
it	1
looks	1
more	1
like	1
the	1
Devil."	1
"Who	1
on	1
earth	1
are	1
you?"	1
cried	1
the	1
stranger	1
in	1
a	1
high	1
shrill	1
voice,	1
brandishing	1
his	1
cane	1
defensively.	1
"Let	1
me	1
see,"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
looking	1
round	1
to	1
MacIan	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
blandness.	1
"Who	1
are	1
we?"	1
"Come	1
out,"	1
screamed	1
the	1
little	1
man	1
with	1
the	1
stick.	1
"Certainly,"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
and	1
went	1
outside	1
with	1
the	1
sword,	1
MacIan	1
following.	1
Seen	1
more	1
fully,	1
with	1
the	1
evening	1
light	1
on	1
his	1
face,	1
the	1
strange	1
man	1
looked	1
a	1
little	1
less	1
like	1
a	1
goblin.	1
He	1
wore	1
a	1
square	1
pale-grey	1
jacket	1
suit,	1
on	1
which	1
the	1
grey	1
butterfly	1
tie	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
indisputable	1
touch	1
of	1
affectation.	1
Against	1
the	1
great	1
sunset	1
his	1
figure	1
had	1
looked	1
merely	1
small:	1
seen	1
in	1
a	1
more	1
equal	1
light	1
it	1
looked	1
tolerably	1
compact	1
and	1
shapely.	1
His	1
reddish-brown	1
hair,	1
combed	1
into	1
two	1
great	1
curls,	1
looked	1
like	1
the	1
long,	1
slow	1
curling	1
hair	1
of	1
the	1
women	1
in	1
some	1
pre-Raphaelite	1
pictures.	1
But	1
within	1
this	1
feminine	1
frame	1
of	1
hair	1
his	1
face	1
was	1
unexpectedly	1
impudent,	1
like	1
a	1
monkey's.	1
"What	1
are	1
you	1
doing	1
here?"	1
he	1
said,	1
in	1
a	1
sharp	1
small	1
voice.	1
"Well,"	1
said	1
MacIan,	1
in	1
his	1
grave	1
childish	1
way,	1
"what	1
are	1
_you_	1
doing	1
here?"	1
"I,"	1
said	1
the	1
man,	1
indignantly,	1
"I'm	1
in	1
my	1
own	1
garden."	1
"Oh,"	1
said	1
MacIan,	1
simply,	1
"I	1
apologize."	1
Turnbull	1
was	1
coolly	1
curling	1
his	1
red	1
moustache,	1
and	1
the	1
stranger	1
stared	1
from	1
one	1
to	1
the	1
other,	1
temporarily	1
stunned	1
by	1
their	1
innocent	1
assurance.	1
"But,	1
may	1
I	1
ask,"	1
he	1
said	1
at	1
last,	1
"what	1
the	1
devil	1
you	1
are	1
doing	1
in	1
my	1
summer-house?"	1
"Certainly,"	1
said	1
MacIan.	1
"We	1
were	1
just	1
going	1
to	1
fight."	1
"To	1
fight!"	1
repeated	1
the	1
man.	1
"We	1
had	1
better	1
tell	1
this	1
gentleman	1
the	1
whole	1
business,"	1
broke	1
in	1
Turnbull.	1
Then	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
stranger	1
he	1
said	1
firmly,	1
"I	1
am	1
sorry,	1
sir,	1
but	1
we	1
have	1
something	1
to	1
do	1
that	1
must	1
be	1
done.	1
And	1
I	1
may	1
as	1
well	1
tell	1
you	1
at	1
the	1
beginning	1
and	1
to	1
avoid	1
waste	1
of	1
time	1
or	1
language,	1
that	1
we	1
cannot	1
admit	1
any	1
interference."	1
"We	1
were	1
just	1
going	1
to	1
take	1
some	1
slight	1
refreshment	1
when	1
you	1
interrupted	1
us..."	1
The	1
little	1
man	1
had	1
a	1
dawning	1
expression	1
of	1
understanding	1
and	1
stooped	1
and	1
picked	1
up	1
the	1
unused	1
bottle	1
of	1
wine,	1
eyeing	1
it	1
curiously.	1
Turnbull	1
continued:	1
"But	1
that	1
refreshment	1
was	1
preparatory	1
to	1
something	1
which	1
I	1
fear	1
you	1
will	1
find	1
less	1
comprehensible,	1
but	1
on	1
which	1
our	1
minds	1
are	1
entirely	1
fixed,	1
sir.	1
We	1
are	1
forced	1
to	1
fight	1
a	1
duel.	1
We	1
are	1
forced	1
by	1
honour	1
and	1
an	1
internal	1
intellectual	1
need.	1
Do	1
not,	1
for	1
your	1
own	1
sake,	1
attempt	1
to	1
stop	1
us.	1
I	1
know	1
all	1
the	1
excellent	1
and	1
ethical	1
things	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
want	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
us.	1
I	1
know	1
all	1
about	1
the	1
essential	1
requirements	1
of	1
civil	1
order:	1
I	1
have	1
written	1
leading	1
articles	1
about	1
them	1
all	1
my	1
life.	1
I	1
know	1
all	1
about	1
the	1
sacredness	1
of	1
human	1
life;	1
I	1
have	1
bored	1
all	1
my	1
friends	1
with	1
it.	1
Try	1
and	1
understand	1
our	1
position.	1
This	1
man	1
and	1
I	1
are	1
alone	1
in	1
the	1
modern	1
world	1
in	1
that	1
we	1
think	1
that	1
God	1
is	1
essentially	1
important.	1
I	1
think	1
He	1
does	1
not	1
exist;	1
that	1
is	1
where	1
the	1
importance	1
comes	1
in	1
for	1
me.	1
But	1
this	1
man	1
thinks	1
that	1
He	1
does	1
exist,	1
and	1
thinking	1
that	1
very	1
properly	1
thinks	1
Him	1
more	1
important	1
than	1
anything	1
else.	1
Now	1
we	1
wish	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
great	1
demonstration	1
and	1
assertion--something	1
that	1
will	1
set	1
the	1
world	1
on	1
fire	1
like	1
the	1
first	1
Christian	1
persecutions.	1
If	1
you	1
like,	1
we	1
are	1
attempting	1
a	1
mutual	1
martyrdom.	1
The	1
papers	1
have	1
posted	1
up	1
every	1
town	1
against	1
us.	1
Scotland	1
Yard	1
has	1
fortified	1
every	1
police	1
station	1
with	1
our	1
enemies;	1
we	1
are	1
driven	1
therefore	1
to	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
a	1
lonely	1
lane,	1
and	1
indirectly	1
to	1
taking	1
liberties	1
with	1
your	1
summer-house	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
arrange	1
our..."	1
"Stop!"	1
roared	1
the	1
little	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
butterfly	1
necktie.	1
"Put	1
me	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
intellectual	1
misery.	1
Are	1
you	1
really	1
the	1
two	1
tomfools	1
I	1
have	1
read	1
of	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
papers?	1
Are	1
you	1
the	1
two	1
people	1
who	1
wanted	1
to	1
spit	1
each	1
other	1
in	1
the	1
Police	1
Court?	1
Are	1
you?	1
Are	1
you?"	1
"Yes,"	1
said	1
MacIan,	1
"it	1
began	1
in	1
a	1
Police	1
Court."	1
The	1
little	1
man	1
slung	1
the	1
bottle	1
of	1
wine	1
twenty	1
yards	1
away	1
like	1
a	1
stone.	1
"Come	1
up	1
to	1
my	1
place,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"I've	1
got	1
better	1
stuff	1
than	1
that.	1
I've	1
got	1
the	1
best	1
Beaune	1
within	1
fifty	1
miles	1
of	1
here.	1
Come	1
up.	1
You're	1
the	1
very	1
men	1
I	1
wanted	1
to	1
see."	1
Even	1
Turnbull,	1
with	1
his	1
typical	1
invulnerability,	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
taken	1
aback	1
by	1
this	1
boisterous	1
and	1
almost	1
brutal	1
hospitality.	1
"Why...sir..."	1
he	1
began.	1
"Come	1
up!	1
Come	1
in!"	1
howled	1
the	1
little	1
man,	1
dancing	1
with	1
delight.	1
"I'll	1
give	1
you	1
a	1
dinner.	1
I'll	1
give	1
you	1
a	1
bed!	1
I'll	1
give	1
you	1
a	1
green	1
smooth	1
lawn	1
and	1
your	1
choice	1
of	1
swords	1
and	1
pistols.	1
Why,	1
you	1
fools,	1
I	1
adore	1
fighting!	1
It's	1
the	1
only	1
good	1
thing	1
in	1
God's	1
world!	1
I've	1
walked	1
about	1
these	1
damned	1
fields	1
and	1
longed	1
to	1
see	1
somebody	1
cut	1
up	1
and	1
killed	1
and	1
the	1
blood	1
running.	1
Ha!	1
Ha!"	1
And	1
he	1
made	1
sudden	1
lunges	1
with	1
his	1
stick	1
at	1
the	1
trunk	1
of	1
a	1
neighbouring	1
tree	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
ferrule	1
made	1
fierce	1
prints	1
and	1
punctures	1
in	1
the	1
bark.	1
"Excuse	1
me,"	1
said	1
MacIan	1
suddenly	1
with	1
the	1
wide-eyed	1
curiosity	1
of	1
a	1
child,	1
"excuse	1
me,	1
but..."	1
"Well?"	1
said	1
the	1
small	1
fighter,	1
brandishing	1
his	1
wooden	1
weapon.	1
"Excuse	1
me,"	1
repeated	1
MacIan,	1
"but	1
was	1
that	1
what	1
you	1
were	1
doing	1
at	1
the	1
door?"	1
The	1
little	1
man	1
stared	1
an	1
instant	1
and	1
then	1
said:	1
"Yes,"	1
and	1
Turnbull	1
broke	1
into	1
a	1
guffaw.	1
"Come	1
on!"	1
cried	1
the	1
little	1
man,	1
tucking	1
his	1
stick	1
under	1
his	1
arm	1
and	1
taking	1
quite	1
suddenly	1
to	1
his	1
heels.	1
"Come	1
on!	1
Confound	1
me,	1
I'll	1
see	1
both	1
of	1
you	1
eat	1
and	1
then	1
I'll	1
see	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
die.	1
Lord	1
bless	1
me,	1
the	1
gods	1
must	1
exist	1
after	1
all--they	1
have	1
sent	1
me	1
one	1
of	1
my	1
day-dreams!	1
Lord!	1
A	1
duel!"	1
He	1
had	1
gone	1
flying	1
along	1
a	1
winding	1
path	1
between	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
the	1
kitchen	1
garden,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
increasing	1
twilight	1
he	1
was	1
as	1
hard	1
to	1
follow	1
as	1
a	1
flying	1
hare.	1
But	1
at	1
length	1
the	1
path	1
after	1
many	1
twists	1
betrayed	1
its	1
purpose	1
and	1
led	1
abruptly	1
up	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
steps	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
a	1
tiny	1
but	1
very	1
clean	1
cottage.	1
There	1
was	1
nothing	1
about	1
the	1
outside	1
to	1
distinguish	1
it	1
from	1
other	1
cottages,	1
except	1
indeed	1
its	1
ominous	1
cleanliness	1
and	1
one	1
thing	1
that	1
was	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
custom	1
and	1
tradition	1
of	1
all	1
cottages	1
under	1
the	1
sun.	1
In	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
garden	1
among	1
the	1
stocks	1
and	1
marigolds	1
there	1
surged	1
up	1
in	1
shapeless	1
stone	1
a	1
South	1
Sea	1
Island	1
idol.	1
There	1
was	1
something	1
gross	1
and	1
even	1
evil	1
in	1
that	1
eyeless	1
and	1
alien	1
god	1
among	1
the	1
most	1
innocent	1
of	1
the	1
English	1
flowers.	1
"Come	1
in!"	1
cried	1
the	1
creature	1
again.	1
"Come	1
in!	1
it's	1
better	1
inside!"	1
Whether	1
or	1
no	1
it	1
was	1
better	1
inside	1
it	1
was	1
at	1
least	1
a	1
surprise.	1
The	1
moment	1
the	1
two	1
duellists	1
had	1
pushed	1
open	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
that	1
inoffensive,	1
whitewashed	1
cottage	1
they	1
found	1
that	1
its	1
interior	1
was	1
lined	1
with	1
fiery	1
gold.	1
It	1
was	1
like	1
stepping	1
into	1
a	1
chamber	1
in	1
the	1
Arabian	1
Nights.	1
The	1
door	1
that	1
closed	1
behind	1
them	1
shut	1
out	1
England	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
energies	1
of	1
the	1
West.	1
The	1
ornaments	1
that	1
shone	1
and	1
shimmered	1
on	1
every	1
side	1
of	1
them	1
were	1
subtly	1
mixed	1
from	1
many	1
periods	1
and	1
lands,	1
but	1
were	1
all	1
oriental.	1
Cruel	1
Assyrian	1
bas-reliefs	1
ran	1
along	1
the	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
passage;	1
cruel	1
Turkish	1
swords	1
and	1
daggers	1
glinted	1
above	1
and	1
below	1
them;	1
the	1
two	1
were	1
separated	1
by	1
ages	1
and	1
fallen	1
civilizations.	1
Yet	1
they	1
seemed	1
to	1
sympathize	1
since	1
they	1
were	1
both	1
harmonious	1
and	1
both	1
merciless.	1
The	1
house	1
seemed	1
to	1
consist	1
of	1
chamber	1
within	1
chamber	1
and	1
created	1
that	1
impression	1
as	1
of	1
a	1
dream	1
which	1
belongs	1
also	1
to	1
the	1
Arabian	1
Nights	1
themselves.	1
The	1
innermost	1
room	1
of	1
all	1
was	1
like	1
the	1
inside	1
of	1
a	1
jewel.	1
The	1
little	1
man	1
who	1
owned	1
it	1
all	1
threw	1
himself	1
on	1
a	1
heap	1
of	1
scarlet	1
and	1
golden	1
cushions	1
and	1
struck	1
his	1
hands	1
together.	1
A	1
negro	1
in	1
a	1
white	1
robe	1
and	1
turban	1
appeared	1
suddenly	1
and	1
silently	1
behind	1
them.	1
"Selim,"	1
said	1
the	1
host,	1
"these	1
two	1
gentlemen	1
are	1
staying	1
with	1
me	1
tonight.	1
Send	1
up	1
the	1
very	1
best	1
wine	1
and	1
dinner	1
at	1
once.	1
And	1
Selim,	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
gentlemen	1
will	1
probably	1
die	1
tomorrow.	1
Make	1
arrangements,	1
please."	1
The	1
negro	1
bowed	1
and	1
withdrew.	1
Evan	1
MacIan	1
came	1
out	1
the	1
next	1
morning	1
into	1
the	1
little	1
garden	1
to	1
a	1
fresh	1
silver	1
day,	1
his	1
long	1
face	1
looking	1
more	1
austere	1
than	1
ever	1
in	1
that	1
cold	1
light,	1
his	1
eyelids	1
a	1
little	1
heavy.	1
He	1
carried	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
swords.	1
Turnbull	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
little	1
house	1
behind	1
him,	1
demolishing	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
an	1
early	1
breakfast	1
and	1
humming	1
a	1
tune	1
to	1
himself,	1
which	1
could	1
be	1
heard	1
through	1
the	1
open	1
window.	1
A	1
moment	1
or	1
two	1
later	1
he	1
leapt	1
to	1
his	1
feet	1
and	1
came	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
sunlight,	1
still	1
munching	1
toast,	1
his	1
own	1
sword	1
stuck	1
under	1
his	1
arm	1
like	1
a	1
walking-stick.	1
Their	1
eccentric	1
host	1
had	1
vanished	1
from	1
sight,	1
with	1
a	1
polite	1
gesture,	1
some	1
twenty	1
minutes	1
before.	1
They	1
imagined	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
occupied	1
on	1
some	1
concerns	1
in	1
the	1
interior	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
they	1
waited	1
for	1
his	1
emergence,	1
stamping	1
the	1
garden	1
in	1
silence--the	1
garden	1
of	1
tall,	1
fresh	1
country	1
flowers,	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
monstrous	1
South	1
Sea	1
idol	1
lifted	1
itself	1
as	1
abruptly	1
as	1
the	1
prow	1
of	1
a	1
ship	1
riding	1
on	1
a	1
sea	1
of	1
red	1
and	1
white	1
and	1
gold.	1
It	1
was	1
with	1
a	1
start,	1
therefore,	1
that	1
they	1
came	1
upon	1
the	1
man	1
himself	1
already	1
in	1
the	1
garden.	1
They	1
were	1
all	1
the	1
more	1
startled	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
still	1
posture	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
found	1
him.	1
He	1
was	1
on	1
his	1
knees	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
stone	1
idol,	1
rigid	1
and	1
motionless,	1
like	1
a	1
saint	1
in	1
a	1
trance	1
or	1
ecstasy.	1
Yet	1
when	1
Turnbull's	1
tread	1
broke	1
a	1
twig,	1
he	1
was	1
on	1
his	1
feet	1
in	1
a	1
flash.	1
"Excuse	1
me,"	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
an	1
irradiation	1
of	1
smiles,	1
but	1
yet	1
with	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
bewilderment.	1
"So	1
sorry...family	1
prayers...old	1
fashioned...mother's	1
knee.	1
Let	1
us	1
go	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
lawn	1
behind."	1
And	1
he	1
ducked	1
rapidly	1
round	1
the	1
statue	1
to	1
an	1
open	1
space	1
of	1
grass	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
it.	1
"This	1
will	1
do	1
us	1
best,	1
Mr.	1
MacIan,"	1
said	1
he.	1
Then	1
he	1
made	1
a	1
gesture	1
towards	1
the	1
heavy	1
stone	1
figure	1
on	1
the	1
pedestal	1
which	1
had	1
now	1
its	1
blank	1
and	1
shapeless	1
back	1
turned	1
towards	1
them.	1
"Don't	1
you	1
be	1
afraid,"	1
he	1
added,	1
"he	1
can	1
still	1
see	1
us."	1
MacIan	1
turned	1
his	1
blue,	1
blinking	1
eyes,	1
which	1
seemed	1
still	1
misty	1
with	1
sleep	1
(or	1
sleeplessness)	1
towards	1
the	1
idol,	1
but	1
his	1
brows	1
drew	1
together.	1
The	1
little	1
man	1
with	1
the	1
long	1
hair	1
also	1
had	1
his	1
eyes	1
on	1
the	1
back	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
god.	1
His	1
eyes	1
were	1
at	1
once	1
liquid	1
and	1
burning,	1
and	1
he	1
rubbed	1
his	1
hands	1
slowly	1
against	1
each	1
other.	1
"Do	1
you	1
know,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"I	1
think	1
he	1
can	1
see	1
us	1
better	1
this	1
way.	1
I	1
often	1
think	1
that	1
this	1
blank	1
thing	1
is	1
his	1
real	1
face,	1
watching,	1
though	1
it	1
cannot	1
be	1
watched.	1
He!	1
he!	1
Yes,	1
I	1
think	1
he	1
looks	1
nice	1
from	1
behind.	1
He	1
looks	1
more	1
cruel	1
from	1
behind,	1
don't	1
you	1
think?"	1
"What	1
the	1
devil	1
is	1
the	1
thing?"	1
asked	1
Turnbull	1
gruffly.	1
"It	1
is	1
the	1
only	1
Thing	1
there	1
is,"	1
answered	1
the	1
other.	1
"It	1
is	1
Force."	1
"Oh!"	1
said	1
Turnbull	1
shortly.	1
"Yes,	1
my	1
friends,"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
man,	1
with	1
an	1
animated	1
countenance,	1
fluttering	1
his	1
fingers	1
in	1
the	1
air,	1
"it	1
was	1
no	1
chance	1
that	1
led	1
you	1
to	1
this	1
garden;	1
surely	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
caprice	1
of	1
some	1
old	1
god,	1
some	1
happy,	1
pitiless	1
god.	1
Perhaps	1
it	1
was	1
his	1
will,	1
for	1
he	1
loves	1
blood;	1
and	1
on	1
that	1
stone	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
him	1
men	1
have	1
been	1
butchered	1
by	1
hundreds	1
in	1
the	1
fierce,	1
feasting	1
islands	1
of	1
the	1
South.	1
In	1
this	1
cursed,	1
craven	1
place	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
been	1
permitted	1
to	1
kill	1
men	1
on	1
his	1
altar.	1
Only	1
rabbits	1
and	1
cats,	1
sometimes."	1
In	1
the	1
stillness	1
MacIan	1
made	1
a	1
sudden	1
movement,	1
unmeaning	1
apparently,	1
and	1
then	1
remained	1
rigid.	1
"But	1
today,	1
today,"	1
continued	1
the	1
small	1
man	1
in	1
a	1
shrill	1
voice.	1
"Today	1
his	1
hour	1
is	1
come.	1
Today	1
his	1
will	1
is	1
done	1
on	1
earth	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
heaven.	1
Men,	1
men,	1
men	1
will	1
bleed	1
before	1
him	1
today."	1
And	1
he	1
bit	1
his	1
forefinger	1
in	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
fever.	1
Still,	1
the	1
two	1
duellists	1
stood	1
with	1
their	1
swords	1
as	1
heavily	1
as	1
statues,	1
and	1
the	1
silence	1
seemed	1
to	1
cool	1
the	1
eccentric	1
and	1
call	1
him	1
back	1
to	1
more	1
rational	1
speech.	1
"Perhaps	1
I	1
express	1
myself	1
a	1
little	1
too	1
lyrically,"	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
an	1
amicable	1
abruptness.	1
"My	1
philosophy	1
has	1
its	1
higher	1
ecstasies,	1
but	1
perhaps	1
you	1
are	1
hardly	1
worked	1
up	1
to	1
them	1
yet.	1
Let	1
us	1
confine	1
ourselves	1
to	1
the	1
unquestioned.	1
You	1
have	1
found	1
your	1
way,	1
gentlemen,	1
by	1
a	1
beautiful	1
accident,	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
only	1
man	1
in	1
England	1
(probably)	1
who	1
will	1
favour	1
and	1
encourage	1
your	1
most	1
reasonable	1
project.	1
From	1
Cornwall	1
to	1
Cape	1
Wrath	1
this	1
county	1
is	1
one	1
horrible,	1
solid	1
block	1
of	1
humanitarianism.	1
You	1
will	1
find	1
men	1
who	1
will	1
defend	1
this	1
or	1
that	1
war	1
in	1
a	1
distant	1
continent.	1
They	1
will	1
defend	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
contemptible	1
ground	1
of	1
commerce	1
or	1
the	1
more	1
contemptible	1
ground	1
of	1
social	1
good.	1
But	1
do	1
not	1
fancy	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
find	1
one	1
other	1
person	1
who	1
will	1
comprehend	1
a	1
strong	1
man	1
taking	1
the	1
sword	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
wiping	1
out	1
his	1
enemy.	1
My	1
name	1
is	1
Wimpey,	1
Morrice	1
Wimpey.	1
I	1
had	1
a	1
Fellowship	1
at	1
Magdalen.	1
But	1
I	1
assure	1
you	1
I	1
had	1
to	1
drop	1
it,	1
owing	1
to	1
my	1
having	1
said	1
something	1
in	1
a	1
public	1
lecture	1
infringing	1
the	1
popular	1
prejudice	1
against	1
those	1
great	1
gentlemen,	1
the	1
assassins	1
of	1
the	1
Italian	1
Renaissance.	1
They	1
let	1
me	1
say	1
it	1
at	1
dinner	1
and	1
so	1
on,	1
and	1
seemed	1
to	1
like	1
it.	1
But	1
in	1
a	1
public	1
lecture...so	1
inconsistent.	1
Well,	1
as	1
I	1
say,	1
here	1
is	1
your	1
only	1
refuge	1
and	1
temple	1
of	1
honour.	1
Here	1
you	1
can	1
fall	1
back	1
on	1
that	1
naked	1
and	1
awful	1
arbitration	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
only	1
thing	1
that	1
balances	1
the	1
stars--a	1
still,	1
continuous	1
violence.	1
_Vae	1
Victis!_	1
Down,	1
down,	1
down	1
with	1
the	1
defeated!	1
Victory	1
is	1
the	1
only	1
ultimate	1
fact.	1
Carthage	1
_was_	1
destroyed,	1
the	1
Red	1
Indians	1
are	1
being	1
exterminated:	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
single	1
certainty.	1
In	1
an	1
hour	1
from	1
now	1
that	1
sun	1
will	1
still	1
be	1
shining	1
and	1
that	1
grass	1
growing,	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
conquered;	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
conqueror.	1
When	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
done,	1
nothing	1
will	1
alter	1
it.	1
Heroes,	1
I	1
give	1
you	1
the	1
hospitality	1
fit	1
for	1
heroes.	1
And	1
I	1
salute	1
the	1
survivor.	1
Fall	1
on!"	1
The	1
two	1
men	1
took	1
their	1
swords.	1
Then	1
MacIan	1
said	1
steadily:	1
"Mr.	1
Turnbull,	1
lend	1
me	1
your	1
sword	1
a	1
moment."	1
Turnbull,	1
with	1
a	1
questioning	1
glance,	1
handed	1
him	1
the	1
weapon.	1
MacIan	1
took	1
the	1
second	1
sword	1
in	1
his	1
left	1
hand	1
and,	1
with	1
a	1
violent	1
gesture,	1
hurled	1
it	1
at	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
little	1
Mr.	1
Wimpey.	1
"Fight!"	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
loud,	1
harsh	1
voice.	1
"Fight	1
me	1
now!"	1
Wimpey	1
took	1
a	1
step	1
backward,	1
and	1
bewildered	1
words	1
bubbled	1
on	1
his	1
lips.	1
"Pick	1
up	1
that	1
sword	1
and	1
fight	1
me,"	1
repeated	1
MacIan,	1
with	1
brows	1
as	1
black	1
as	1
thunder.	1
The	1
little	1
man	1
turned	1
to	1
Turnbull	1
with	1
a	1
gesture,	1
demanding	1
judgement	1
or	1
protection.	1
"Really,	1
sir,"	1
he	1
began,	1
"this	1
gentleman	1
confuses..."	1
"You	1
stinking	1
little	1
coward,"	1
roared	1
Turnbull,	1
suddenly	1
releasing	1
his	1
wrath.	1
"Fight,	1
if	1
you're	1
so	1
fond	1
of	1
fighting!	1
Fight,	1
if	1
you're	1
so	1
fond	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
filthy	1
philosophy!	1
If	1
winning	1
is	1
everything,	1
go	1
in	1
and	1
win!	1
If	1
the	1
weak	1
must	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
wall,	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
wall!	1
Fight,	1
you	1
rat!	1
Fight,	1
or	1
if	1
you	1
won't	1
fight--run!"	1
And	1
he	1
ran	1
at	1
Wimpey,	1
with	1
blazing	1
eyes.	1
Wimpey	1
staggered	1
back	1
a	1
few	1
paces	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
struggling	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
limbs.	1
Then	1
he	1
felt	1
the	1
furious	1
Scotchman	1
coming	1
at	1
him	1
like	1
an	1
express	1
train,	1
doubling	1
his	1
size	1
every	1
second,	1
with	1
eyes	1
as	1
big	1
as	1
windows	1
and	1
a	1
sword	1
as	1
bright	1
as	1
the	1
sun.	1
Something	1
broke	1
inside	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
found	1
himself	1
running	1
away,	1
tumbling	1
over	1
his	1
own	1
feet	1
in	1
terror,	1
and	1
crying	1
out	1
as	1
he	1
ran.	1
"Chase	1
him!"	1
shouted	1
Turnbull	1
as	1
MacIan	1
snatched	1
up	1
the	1
sword	1
and	1
joined	1
in	1
the	1
scamper.	1
"Chase	1
him	1
over	1
a	1
county!	1
Chase	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
sea!	1
Shoo!	1
Shoo!	1
Shoo!"	1
The	1
little	1
man	1
plunged	1
like	1
a	1
rabbit	1
among	1
the	1
tall	1
flowers,	1
the	1
two	1
duellists	1
after	1
him.	1
Turnbull	1
kept	1
at	1
his	1
tail	1
with	1
savage	1
ecstasy,	1
still	1
shooing	1
him	1
like	1
a	1
cat.	1
But	1
MacIan,	1
as	1
he	1
ran	1
past	1
the	1
South	1
Sea	1
idol,	1
paused	1
an	1
instant	1
to	1
spring	1
upon	1
its	1
pedestal.	1
For	1
five	1
seconds	1
he	1
strained	1
against	1
the	1
inert	1
mass.	1
Then	1
it	1
stirred;	1
and	1
he	1
sent	1
it	1
over	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
crash	1
among	1
the	1
flowers,	1
that	1
engulfed	1
it	1
altogether.	1
Then	1
he	1
went	1
bounding	1
after	1
the	1
runaway.	1
In	1
the	1
energy	1
of	1
his	1
alarm	1
the	1
ex-Fellow	1
of	1
Magdalen	1
managed	1
to	1
leap	1
the	1
paling	1
of	1
his	1
garden.	1
The	1
two	1
pursuers	1
went	1
over	1
it	1
after	1
him	1
like	1
flying	1
birds.	1
He	1
fled	1
frantically	1
down	1
a	1
long	1
lane	1
with	1
his	1
two	1
terrors	1
on	1
his	1
trail	1
till	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
gap	1
in	1
the	1
hedge	1
and	1
went	1
across	1
a	1
steep	1
meadow	1
like	1
the	1
wind.	1
The	1
two	1
Scotchmen,	1
as	1
they	1
ran,	1
kept	1
up	1
a	1
cheery	1
bellowing	1
and	1
waved	1
their	1
swords.	1
Up	1
three	1
slanting	1
meadows,	1
down	1
four	1
slanting	1
meadows	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side,	1
across	1
another	1
road,	1
across	1
a	1
heath	1
of	1
snapping	1
bracken,	1
through	1
a	1
wood,	1
across	1
another	1
road,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
brink	1
of	1
a	1
big	1
pool,	1
they	1
pursued	1
the	1
flying	1
philosopher.	1
But	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
pool	1
his	1
pace	1
was	1
so	1
precipitate	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
stop	1
it,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
lurching	1
stagger,	1
he	1
fell	1
splash	1
into	1
the	1
greasy	1
water.	1
Getting	1
dripping	1
to	1
his	1
feet,	1
with	1
the	1
water	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
knees,	1
the	1
worshipper	1
of	1
force	1
and	1
victory	1
waded	1
disconsolately	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
and	1
drew	1
himself	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
bank.	1
And	1
Turnbull	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
grass	1
and	1
went	1
off	1
into	1
reverberations	1
of	1
laughter.	1
A	1
second	1
afterwards	1
the	1
most	1
extraordinary	1
grimaces	1
were	1
seen	1
to	1
distort	1
the	1
stiff	1
face	1
of	1
MacIan,	1
and	1
unholy	1
sounds	1
came	1
from	1
within.	1
He	1
had	1
never	1
practised	1
laughing,	1
and	1
it	1
hurt	1
him	1
very	1
much.	1
VII.	1
THE	1
VILLAGE	1
OF	1
GRASSLEY-IN-THE-HOLE	1
At	1
about	1
half	1
past	1
one,	1
under	1
a	1
strong	1
blue	1
sky,	1
Turnbull	1
got	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
grass	1
and	1
fern	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
lying,	1
and	1
his	1
still	1
intermittent	1
laughter	1
ended	1
in	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
yawn.	1
"I'm	1
hungry,"	1
he	1
said	1
shortly.	1
"Are	1
you?"	1
"I	1
have	1
not	1
noticed,"	1
answered	1
MacIan.	1
"What	1
are	1
you	1
going	1
to	1
do?"	1
"There's	1
a	1
village	1
down	1
the	1
road,	1
past	1
the	1
pool,"	1
answered	1
Turnbull.	1
"I	1
can	1
see	1
it	1
from	1
here.	1
I	1
can	1
see	1
the	1
whitewashed	1
walls	1
of	1
some	1
cottages	1
and	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
church.	1
How	1
jolly	1
it	1
all	1
looks.	1
It	1
looks	1
so--I	1
don't	1
know	1
what	1
the	1
word	1
is--so	1
sensible.	1
Don't	1
fancy	1
I'm	1
under	1
any	1
illusions	1
about	1
Arcadian	1
virtue	1
and	1
the	1
innocent	1
villagers.	1
Men	1
make	1
beasts	1
of	1
themselves	1
there	1
with	1
drink,	1
but	1
they	1
don't	1
deliberately	1
make	1
devils	1
of	1
themselves	1
with	1
mere	1
talking.	1
They	1
kill	1
wild	1
animals	1
in	1
the	1
wild	1
woods,	1
but	1
they	1
don't	1
kill	1
cats	1
to	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Victory.	1
They	1
don't----"	1
He	1
broke	1
off	1
and	1
suddenly	1
spat	1
on	1
the	1
ground.	1
"Excuse	1
me,"	1
he	1
said;	1
"it	1
was	1
ceremonial.	1
One	1
has	1
to	1
get	1
the	1
taste	1
out	1
of	1
one's	1
mouth."	1
"The	1
taste	1
of	1
what?"	1
asked	1
MacIan.	1
"I	1
don't	1
know	1
the	1
exact	1
name	1
for	1
it,"	1
replied	1
Turnbull.	1
"Perhaps	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
South	1
Sea	1
Islands,	1
or	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
Magdalen	1
College."	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
long	1
pause,	1
and	1
MacIan	1
also	1
lifted	1
his	1
large	1
limbs	1
off	1
the	1
ground--his	1
eyes	1
particularly	1
dreamy.	1
"I	1
know	1
what	1
you	1
mean,	1
Turnbull,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"but...I	1
always	1
thought	1
you	1
people	1
agreed	1
with	1
all	1
that."	1
"With	1
all	1
that	1
about	1
doing	1
as	1
one	1
likes,	1
and	1
the	1
individual,	1
and	1
Nature	1
loving	1
the	1
strongest,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
that	1
cockroach	1
talked	1
about."	1
Turnbull's	1
big	1
blue-grey	1
eyes	1
stood	1
open	1
with	1
a	1
grave	1
astonishment.	1
"Do	1
you	1
really	1
mean	1
to	1
say,	1
MacIan,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"that	1
you	1
fancied	1
that	1
we,	1
the	1
Free-thinkers,	1
that	1
Bradlaugh,	1
or	1
Holyoake,	1
or	1
Ingersoll,	1
believe	1
all	1
that	1
dirty,	1
immoral	1
mysticism	1
about	1
Nature?	1
Damn	1
Nature!"	1
"I	1
supposed	1
you	1
did,"	1
said	1
MacIan	1
calmly.	1
"It	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
your	1
most	1
conclusive	1
position."	1
"And	1
you	1
mean	1
to	1
tell	1
me,"	1
rejoined	1
the	1
other,	1
"that	1
you	1
broke	1
my	1
window,	1
and	1
challenged	1
me	1
to	1
mortal	1
combat,	1
and	1
tied	1
a	1
tradesman	1
up	1
with	1
ropes,	1
and	1
chased	1
an	1
Oxford	1
Fellow	1
across	1
five	1
meadows--all	1
under	1
the	1
impression	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
such	1
an	1
illiterate	1
idiot	1
as	1
to	1
believe	1
in	1
Nature!"	1
"I	1
supposed	1
you	1
did,"	1
repeated	1
MacIan	1
with	1
his	1
usual	1
mildness;	1
"but	1
I	1
admit	1
that	1
I	1
know	1
little	1
of	1
the	1
details	1
of	1
your	1
belief--or	1
disbelief."	1
Turnbull	1
swung	1
round	1
quite	1
suddenly,	1
and	1
set	1
off	1
towards	1
the	1
village.	1
"Come	1
along,"	1
he	1
cried.	1
"Come	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
village.	1
Come	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
nearest	1
decent	1
inhabitable	1
pub.	1
This	1
is	1
a	1
case	1
for	1
beer."	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
quite	1
follow	1
you,"	1
said	1
the	1
Highlander.	1
"Yes,	1
you	1
do,"	1
answered	1
Turnbull.	1
"You	1
follow	1
me	1
slap	1
into	1
the	1
inn-parlour.	1
I	1
repeat,	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
case	1
for	1
beer.	1
We	1
must	1
have	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
this	1
matter	1
out	1
thoroughly	1
before	1
we	1
go	1
a	1
step	1
farther.	1
Do	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
an	1
idea	1
has	1
just	1
struck	1
me	1
of	1
great	1
simplicity	1
and	1
of	1
some	1
cogency.	1
Do	1
not	1
by	1
any	1
means	1
let	1
us	1
drop	1
our	1
intentions	1
of	1
settling	1
our	1
differences	1
with	1
two	1
steel	1
swords.	1
But	1
do	1
you	1
not	1
think	1
that	1
with	1
two	1
pewter	1
pots	1
we	1
might	1
do	1
what	1
we	1
really	1
have	1
never	1
thought	1
of	1
doing	1
yet--discover	1
what	1
our	1
difference	1
is?"	1
"It	1
never	1
occurred	1
to	1
me	1
before,"	1
answered	1
MacIan	1
with	1
tranquillity.	1
"It	1
is	1
a	1
good	1
suggestion."	1
And	1
they	1
set	1
out	1
at	1
an	1
easy	1
swing	1
down	1
the	1
steep	1
road	1
to	1
the	1
village	1
of	1
Grassley-in-the-Hole.	1
Grassley-in-the-Hole	1
was	1
a	1
rude	1
parallelogram	1
of	1
buildings,	1
with	1
two	1
thoroughfares	1
which	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
called	1
two	1
high	1
streets	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
possible	1
to	1
call	1
them	1
streets.	1
One	1
of	1
these	1
ways	1
was	1
higher	1
on	1
the	1
slope	1
than	1
the	1
other,	1
the	1
whole	1
parallelogram	1
lying	1
aslant,	1
so	1
to	1
speak,	1
on	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
hill.	1
The	1
upper	1
of	1
these	1
two	1
roads	1
was	1
decorated	1
with	1
a	1
big	1
public	1
house,	1
a	1
butcher's	1
shop,	1
a	1
small	1
public	1
house,	1
a	1
sweetstuff	1
shop,	1
a	1
very	1
small	1
public	1
house,	1
and	1
an	1
illegible	1
signpost.	1
The	1
lower	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
roads	1
boasted	1
a	1
horse-pond,	1
a	1
post	1
office,	1
a	1
gentleman's	1
garden	1
with	1
very	1
high	1
hedges,	1
a	1
microscopically	1
small	1
public	1
house,	1
and	1
two	1
cottages.	1
Where	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
lived	1
who	1
supported	1
all	1
the	1
public	1
houses	1
was	1
in	1
this,	1
as	1
in	1
many	1
other	1
English	1
villages,	1
a	1
silent	1
and	1
smiling	1
mystery.	1
The	1
church	1
lay	1
a	1
little	1
above	1
and	1
beyond	1
the	1
village,	1
with	1
a	1
square	1
grey	1
tower	1
dominating	1
it	1
decisively.	1
But	1
even	1
the	1
church	1
was	1
scarcely	1
so	1
central	1
and	1
solemn	1
an	1
institution	1
as	1
the	1
large	1
public	1
house,	1
the	1
Valencourt	1
Arms.	1
It	1
was	1
named	1
after	1
some	1
splendid	1
family	1
that	1
had	1
long	1
gone	1
bankrupt,	1
and	1
whose	1
seat	1
was	1
occupied	1
by	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
invented	1
a	1
hygienic	1
bootjack;	1
but	1
the	1
unfathomable	1
sentimentalism	1
of	1
the	1
English	1
people	1
insisted	1
in	1
regarding	1
the	1
Inn,	1
the	1
seat	1
and	1
the	1
sitter	1
in	1
it,	1
as	1
alike	1
parts	1
of	1
a	1
pure	1
and	1
marmoreal	1
antiquity.	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
Valencourt	1
Arms	1
festivity	1
itself	1
had	1
some	1
solemnity	1
and	1
decorum;	1
and	1
beer	1
was	1
drunk	1
with	1
reverence,	1
as	1
it	1
ought	1
to	1
be.	1
Into	1
the	1
principal	1
parlour	1
of	1
this	1
place	1
entered	1
two	1
strangers,	1
who	1
found	1
themselves,	1
as	1
is	1
always	1
the	1
case	1
in	1
such	1
hostels,	1
the	1
object,	1
not	1
of	1
fluttered	1
curiosity	1
or	1
pert	1
inquiry,	1
but	1
of	1
steady,	1
ceaseless,	1
devouring	1
ocular	1
study.	1
They	1
had	1
long	1
coats	1
down	1
to	1
their	1
heels,	1
and	1
carried	1
under	1
each	1
coat	1
something	1
that	1
looked	1
like	1
a	1
stick.	1
One	1
was	1
tall	1
and	1
dark,	1
the	1
other	1
short	1
and	1
red-haired.	1
They	1
ordered	1
a	1
pot	1
of	1
ale	1
each.	1
"MacIan,"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
lifting	1
his	1
tankard,	1
"the	1
fool	1
who	1
wanted	1
us	1
to	1
be	1
friends	1
made	1
us	1
want	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
fighting.	1
It	1
is	1
only	1
natural	1
that	1
the	1
fool	1
who	1
wanted	1
us	1
to	1
fight	1
should	1
make	1
us	1
friendly.	1
MacIan,	1
your	1
health!"	1
Dusk	1
was	1
already	1
dropping,	1
the	1
rustics	1
in	1
the	1
tavern	1
were	1
already	1
lurching	1
and	1
lumbering	1
out	1
of	1
it	1
by	1
twos	1
and	1
threes,	1
crying	1
clamorous	1
good	1
nights	1
to	1
a	1
solitary	1
old	1
toper	1
that	1
remained,	1
before	1
MacIan	1
and	1
Turnbull	1
had	1
reached	1
the	1
really	1
important	1
part	1
of	1
their	1
discussion.	1
MacIan	1
wore	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
sad	1
bewilderment	1
not	1
uncommon	1
with	1
him.	1
"I	1
am	1
to	1
understand,	1
then,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"that	1
you	1
don't	1
believe	1
in	1
nature."	1
"You	1
may	1
say	1
so	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
special	1
and	1
emphatic	1
sense,"	1
said	1
Turnbull.	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
believe	1
in	1
nature,	1
just	1
as	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
believe	1
in	1
Odin.	1
She	1
is	1
a	1
myth.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
merely	1
that	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
believe	1
that	1
nature	1
can	1
guide	1
us.	1
It	1
is	1
that	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
believe	1
that	1
nature	1
exists."	1
"Exists?"	1
said	1
MacIan	1
in	1
his	1
monotonous	1
way,	1
settling	1
his	1
pewter	1
pot	1
on	1
the	1
table.	1
"Yes,	1
in	1
a	1
real	1
sense	1
nature	1
does	1
not	1
exist.	1
I	1
mean	1
that	1
nobody	1
can	1
discover	1
what	1
the	1
original	1
nature	1
of	1
things	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
if	1
things	1
had	1
not	1
interfered	1
with	1
it.	1
The	1
first	1
blade	1
of	1
grass	1
began	1
to	1
tear	1
up	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
eat	1
it;	1
it	1
was	1
interfering	1
with	1
nature,	1
if	1
there	1
is	1
any	1
nature.	1
The	1
first	1
wild	1
ox	1
began	1
to	1
tear	1
up	1
the	1
grass	1
and	1
eat	1
it;	1
he	1
was	1
interfering	1
with	1
nature,	1
if	1
there	1
is	1
any	1
nature.	1
In	1
the	1
same	1
way,"	1
continued	1
Turnbull,	1
"the	1
human	1
when	1
it	1
asserts	1
its	1
dominance	1
over	1
nature	1
is	1
just	1
as	1
natural	1
as	1
the	1
thing	1
which	1
it	1
destroys."	1
"And	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way,"	1
said	1
MacIan	1
almost	1
dreamily,	1
"the	1
superhuman,	1
the	1
supernatural	1
is	1
just	1
as	1
natural	1
as	1
the	1
nature	1
which	1
it	1
destroys."	1
Turnbull	1
took	1
his	1
head	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
pewter	1
pot	1
in	1
some	1
anger.	1
"The	1
supernatural,	1
of	1
course,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"is	1
quite	1
another	1
thing;	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
the	1
supernatural	1
is	1
simple.	1
The	1
supernatural	1
does	1
not	1
exist."	1
"Quite	1
so,"	1
said	1
MacIan	1
in	1
a	1
rather	1
dull	1
voice;	1
"you	1
said	1
the	1
same	1
about	1
the	1
natural.	1
If	1
the	1
natural	1
does	1
not	1
exist	1
the	1
supernatural	1
obviously	1
can't."	1
And	1
he	1
yawned	1
a	1
little	1
over	1
his	1
ale.	1
Turnbull	1
turned	1
for	1
some	1
reason	1
a	1
little	1
red	1
and	1
remarked	1
quickly,	1
"That	1
may	1
be	1
jolly	1
clever,	1
for	1
all	1
I	1
know.	1
But	1
everyone	1
does	1
know	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
division	1
between	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
as	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
fact	1
do	1
commonly	1
happen	1
and	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
don't.	1
Things	1
that	1
break	1
the	1
evident	1
laws	1
of	1
nature----"	1
"Which	1
does	1
not	1
exist,"	1
put	1
in	1
MacIan	1
sleepily.	1
Turnbull	1
struck	1
the	1
table	1
with	1
a	1
sudden	1
hand.	1
"Good	1
Lord	1
in	1
heaven!"	1
he	1
cried----	1
"Who	1
does	1
not	1
exist,"	1
murmured	1
MacIan.	1
"Good	1
Lord	1
in	1
heaven!"	1
thundered	1
Turnbull,	1
without	1
regarding	1
the	1
interruption.	1
"Do	1
you	1
really	1
mean	1
to	1
sit	1
there	1
and	1
say	1
that	1
you,	1
like	1
anybody	1
else,	1
would	1
not	1
recognize	1
the	1
difference	1
between	1
a	1
natural	1
occurrence	1
and	1
a	1
supernatural	1
one--if	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
such	1
a	1
thing?	1
If	1
I	1
flew	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
ceiling----"	1
"You	1
would	1
bump	1
your	1
head	1
badly,"	1
cried	1
MacIan,	1
suddenly	1
starting	1
up.	1
"One	1
can't	1
talk	1
of	1
this	1
kind	1
of	1
thing	1
under	1
a	1
ceiling	1
at	1
all.	1
Come	1
outside!	1
Come	1
outside	1
and	1
ascend	1
into	1
heaven!"	1
He	1
burst	1
the	1
door	1
open	1
on	1
a	1
blue	1
abyss	1
of	1
evening	1
and	1
they	1
stepped	1
out	1
into	1
it:	1
it	1
was	1
suddenly	1
and	1
strangely	1
cool.	1
"Turnbull,"	1
said	1
MacIan,	1
"you	1
have	1
said	1
some	1
things	1
so	1
true	1
and	1
some	1
so	1
false	1
that	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
talk;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
try	1
to	1
talk	1
so	1
that	1
you	1
understand.	1
For	1
at	1
present	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
understand	1
at	1
all.	1
We	1
don't	1
seem	1
to	1
mean	1
the	1
same	1
things	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
words."	1
He	1
stood	1
silent	1
for	1
a	1
second	1
or	1
two	1
and	1
then	1
resumed.	1
"A	1
minute	1
or	1
two	1
ago	1
I	1
caught	1
you	1
out	1
in	1
a	1
real	1
contradiction.	1
At	1
that	1
moment	1
logically	1
I	1
was	1
right.	1
And	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
I	1
knew	1
I	1
was	1
wrong.	1
Yes,	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
real	1
difference	1
between	1
the	1
natural	1
and	1
the	1
supernatural:	1
if	1
you	1
flew	1
up	1
into	1
that	1
blue	1
sky	1
this	1
instant,	1
I	1
should	1
think	1
that	1
you	1
were	1
moved	1
by	1
God--or	1
the	1
devil.	1
But	1
if	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
I	1
really	1
think...I	1
must	1
explain."	1
He	1
stopped	1
again,	1
abstractedly	1
boring	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
his	1
sword	1
into	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
went	1
on:	1
"I	1
was	1
born	1
and	1
bred	1
and	1
taught	1
in	1
a	1
complete	1
universe.	1
The	1
supernatural	1
was	1
not	1
natural,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
perfectly	1
reasonable.	1
Nay,	1
the	1
supernatural	1
to	1
me	1
is	1
more	1
reasonable	1
than	1
the	1
natural;	1
for	1
the	1
supernatural	1
is	1
a	1
direct	1
message	1
from	1
God,	1
who	1
is	1
reason.	1
I	1
was	1
taught	1
that	1
some	1
things	1
are	1
natural	1
and	1
some	1
things	1
divine.	1
I	1
mean	1
that	1
some	1
things	1
are	1
mechanical	1
and	1
some	1
things	1
divine.	1
But	1
there	1
is	1
the	1
great	1
difficulty,	1
Turnbull.	1
The	1
great	1
difficulty	1
is	1
that,	1
according	1
to	1
my	1
teaching,	1
you	1
are	1
divine."	1
"Me!	1
Divine?"	1
said	1
Turnbull	1
truculently.	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
mean?"	1
"That	1
is	1
just	1
the	1
difficulty,"	1
continued	1
MacIan	1
thoughtfully.	1
"I	1
was	1
told	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
difference	1
between	1
the	1
grass	1
and	1
a	1
man's	1
will;	1
and	1
the	1
difference	1
was	1
that	1
a	1
man's	1
will	1
was	1
special	1
and	1
divine.	1
A	1
man's	1
free	1
will,	1
I	1
heard,	1
was	1
supernatural."	1
"Rubbish!"	1
said	1
Turnbull.	1
"Oh,"	1
said	1
MacIan	1
patiently,	1
"then	1
if	1
a	1
man's	1
free	1
will	1
isn't	1
supernatural,	1
why	1
do	1
your	1
materialists	1
deny	1
that	1
it	1
exists?"	1
Turnbull	1
was	1
silent	1
for	1
a	1
moment.	1
Then	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
speak,	1
but	1
MacIan	1
continued	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
steady	1
voice	1
and	1
sad	1
eyes:	1
"So	1
what	1
I	1
feel	1
is	1
this:	1
Here	1
is	1
the	1
great	1
divine	1
creation	1
I	1
was	1
taught	1
to	1
believe	1
in.	1
I	1
can	1
understand	1
your	1
disbelieving	1
in	1
it,	1
but	1
why	1
disbelieve	1
in	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
it?	1
It	1
was	1
all	1
one	1
thing	1
to	1
me.	1
God	1
had	1
authority	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
God.	1
Man	1
had	1
authority	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
man.	1
You	1
cannot	1
prove	1
that	1
God	1
is	1
better	1
than	1
a	1
man;	1
nor	1
can	1
you	1
prove	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
is	1
better	1
than	1
a	1
horse.	1
Why	1
permit	1
any	1
ordinary	1
thing?	1
Why	1
do	1
you	1
let	1
a	1
horse	1
be	1
saddled?"	1
"Some	1
modern	1
thinkers	1
disapprove	1
of	1
it,"	1
said	1
Turnbull	1
a	1
little	1
doubtfully.	1
"I	1
know,"	1
said	1
MacIan	1
grimly;	1
"that	1
man	1
who	1
talked	1
about	1
love,	1
for	1
instance."	1
Turnbull	1
made	1
a	1
humorous	1
grimace;	1
then	1
he	1
said:	1
"We	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
talking	1
in	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
shorthand;	1
but	1
I	1
won't	1
pretend	1
not	1
to	1
understand	1
you.	1
What	1
you	1
mean	1
is	1
this:	1
that	1
you	1
learnt	1
about	1
all	1
your	1
saints	1
and	1
angels	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
as	1
you	1
learnt	1
about	1
common	1
morality,	1
from	1
the	1
same	1
people,	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way.	1
And	1
you	1
mean	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
if	1
one	1
may	1
be	1
disputed,	1
so	1
may	1
the	1
other.	1
Well,	1
let	1
that	1
pass	1
for	1
the	1
moment.	1
But	1
let	1
me	1
ask	1
you	1
a	1
question	1
in	1
turn.	1
Did	1
not	1
this	1
system	1
of	1
yours,	1
which	1
you	1
swallowed	1
whole,	1
contain	1
all	1
sorts	1
of	1
things	1
that	1
were	1
merely	1
local,	1
the	1
respect	1
for	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
your	1
clan,	1
or	1
such	1
things;	1
the	1
village	1
ghost,	1
the	1
family	1
feud,	1
or	1
what	1
not?	1
Did	1
you	1
not	1
take	1
in	1
those	1
things,	1
too,	1
along	1
with	1
your	1
theology?"	1
MacIan	1
stared	1
along	1
the	1
dim	1
village	1
road,	1
down	1
which	1
the	1
last	1
straggler	1
from	1
the	1
inn	1
was	1
trailing	1
his	1
way.	1
"What	1
you	1
say	1
is	1
not	1
unreasonable,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"But	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
quite	1
true.	1
The	1
distinction	1
between	1
the	1
chief	1
and	1
us	1
did	1
exist;	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
never	1
anything	1
like	1
the	1
distinction	1
between	1
the	1
human	1
and	1
the	1
divine,	1
or	1
the	1
human	1
and	1
the	1
animal.	1
It	1
was	1
more	1
like	1
the	1
distinction	1
between	1
one	1
animal	1
and	1
another.	1
But----"	1
"Well?"	1
said	1
Turnbull.	1
MacIan	1
was	1
silent.	1
"Go	1
on,"	1
repeated	1
Turnbull;	1
"what's	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
you?	1
What	1
are	1
you	1
staring	1
at?"	1
"I	1
am	1
staring,"	1
said	1
MacIan	1
at	1
last,	1
"at	1
that	1
which	1
shall	1
judge	1
us	1
both."	1
"Oh,	1
yes,"	1
said	1
Turnbull	1
in	1
a	1
tired	1
way,	1
"I	1
suppose	1
you	1
mean	1
God."	1
"No,	1
I	1
don't,"	1
said	1
MacIan,	1
shaking	1
his	1
head.	1
"I	1
mean	1
him."	1
And	1
he	1
pointed	1
to	1
the	1
half-tipsy	1
yokel	1
who	1
was	1
ploughing	1
down	1
the	1
road.	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
mean?"	1
asked	1
the	1
atheist.	1
"I	1
mean	1
him,"	1
repeated	1
MacIan	1
with	1
emphasis.	1
"He	1
goes	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
early	1
dawn;	1
he	1
digs	1
or	1
he	1
ploughs	1
a	1
field.	1
Then	1
he	1
comes	1
back	1
and	1
drinks	1
ale,	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
sings	1
a	1
song.	1
All	1
your	1
philosophies	1
and	1
political	1
systems	1
are	1
young	1
compared	1
to	1
him.	1
All	1
your	1
hoary	1
cathedrals,	1
yes,	1
even	1
the	1
Eternal	1
Church	1
on	1
earth	1
is	1
new	1
compared	1
to	1
him.	1
The	1
most	1
mouldering	1
gods	1
in	1
the	1
British	1
Museum	1
are	1
new	1
facts	1
beside	1
him.	1
It	1
is	1
he	1
who	1
in	1
the	1
end	1
shall	1
judge	1
us	1
all."	1
And	1
MacIan	1
rose	1
to	1
his	1
feet	1
with	1
a	1
vague	1
excitement.	1
"What	1
are	1
you	1
going	1
to	1
do?"	1
"I	1
am	1
going	1
to	1
ask	1
him,"	1
cried	1
MacIan,	1
"which	1
of	1
us	1
is	1
right."	1
Turnbull	1
broke	1
into	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
laugh.	1
"Ask	1
that	1
intoxicated	1
turnip-eater----"	1
he	1
began.	1
"Yes--which	1
of	1
us	1
is	1
right,"	1
cried	1
MacIan	1
violently.	1
"Oh,	1
you	1
have	1
long	1
words	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
long	1
words;	1
and	1
I	1
talk	1
of	1
every	1
man	1
being	1
the	1
image	1
of	1
God;	1
and	1
you	1
talk	1
of	1
every	1
man	1
being	1
a	1
citizen	1
and	1
enlightened	1
enough	1
to	1
govern.	1
But	1
if	1
every	1
man	1
typifies	1
God,	1
there	1
is	1
God.	1
If	1
every	1
man	1
is	1
an	1
enlightened	1
citizen,	1
there	1
is	1
your	1
enlightened	1
citizen.	1
The	1
first	1
man	1
one	1
meets	1
is	1
always	1
man.	1
Let	1
us	1
catch	1
him	1
up."	1
And	1
in	1
gigantic	1
strides	1
the	1
long,	1
lean	1
Highlander	1
whirled	1
away	1
into	1
the	1
grey	1
twilight,	1
Turnbull	1
following	1
with	1
a	1
good-humoured	1
oath.	1
The	1
track	1
of	1
the	1
rustic	1
was	1
easy	1
to	1
follow,	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
faltering	1
dark;	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
enlivening	1
his	1
wavering	1
walk	1
with	1
song.	1
It	1
was	1
an	1
interminable	1
poem,	1
beginning	1
with	1
some	1
unspecified	1
King	1
William,	1
who	1
(it	1
appeared)	1
lived	1
in	1
London	1
town	1
and	1
who	1
after	1
the	1
second	1
rise	1
vanished	1
rather	1
abruptly	1
from	1
the	1
train	1
of	1
thought.	1
The	1
rest	1
was	1
almost	1
entirely	1
about	1
beer	1
and	1
was	1
thick	1
with	1
local	1
topography	1
of	1
a	1
quite	1
unrecognizable	1
kind.	1
The	1
singer's	1
step	1
was	1
neither	1
very	1
rapid,	1
nor,	1
indeed,	1
exceptionally	1
secure;	1
so	1
the	1
song	1
grew	1
louder	1
and	1
louder	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
soon	1
overtook	1
him.	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
elderly	1
or	1
rather	1
of	1
any	1
age,	1
with	1
lean	1
grey	1
hair	1
and	1
a	1
lean	1
red	1
face,	1
but	1
with	1
that	1
remarkable	1
rustic	1
physiognomy	1
in	1
which	1
it	1
seems	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
features	1
stand	1
out	1
independently	1
from	1
the	1
face;	1
the	1
rugged	1
red	1
nose	1
going	1
out	1
like	1
a	1
limb;	1
the	1
bleared	1
blue	1
eyes	1
standing	1
out	1
like	1
signals.	1
He	1
gave	1
them	1
greeting	1
with	1
the	1
elaborate	1
urbanity	1
of	1
the	1
slightly	1
intoxicated.	1
MacIan,	1
who	1
was	1
vibrating	1
with	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
silent,	1
violent	1
decisions,	1
opened	1
the	1
question	1
without	1
delay.	1
He	1
explained	1
the	1
philosophic	1
position	1
in	1
words	1
as	1
short	1
and	1
simple	1
as	1
possible.	1
But	1
the	1
singular	1
old	1
man	1
with	1
the	1
lank	1
red	1
face	1
seemed	1
to	1
think	1
uncommonly	1
little	1
of	1
the	1
short	1
words.	1
He	1
fixed	1
with	1
a	1
fierce	1
affection	1
upon	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
of	1
the	1
long	1
ones.	1
"Atheists!"	1
he	1
repeated	1
with	1
luxurious	1
scorn.	1
"Atheists!	1
I	1
know	1
their	1
sort,	1
master.	1
Atheists!	1
Don't	1
talk	1
to	1
me	1
about	1
'un.	1
Atheists!"	1
The	1
grounds	1
of	1
his	1
disdain	1
seemed	1
a	1
little	1
dark	1
and	1
confused;	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
evidently	1
sufficient.	1
MacIan	1
resumed	1
in	1
some	1
encouragement:	1
"You	1
think	1
as	1
I	1
do,	1
I	1
hope;	1
you	1
think	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
should	1
be	1
connected	1
with	1
the	1
Church;	1
with	1
the	1
common	1
Christian----"	1
The	1
old	1
man	1
extended	1
a	1
quivering	1
stick	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
a	1
distant	1
hill.	1
"There's	1
the	1
church,"	1
he	1
said	1
thickly.	1
"Grassley	1
old	1
church	1
that	1
is.	1
Pulled	1
down	1
it	1
was,	1
in	1
the	1
old	1
squire's	1
time,	1
and----"	1
"I	1
mean,"	1
explained	1
MacIan	1
elaborately,	1
"that	1
you	1
think	1
that	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
someone	1
typifying	1
religion,	1
a	1
priest----"	1
"Priests!"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
with	1
sudden	1
passion.	1
"Priests!	1
I	1
know	1
'un.	1
What	1
they	1
want	1
in	1
England?	1
That's	1
what	1
I	1
say.	1
What	1
they	1
want	1
in	1
England?"	1
"They	1
want	1
you,"	1
said	1
MacIan.	1
"Quite	1
so,"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
"and	1
me;	1
but	1
they	1
won't	1
get	1
us.	1
MacIan,	1
your	1
attempt	1
on	1
the	1
primitive	1
innocence	1
does	1
not	1
seem	1
very	1
successful.	1
Let	1
me	1
try.	1
What	1
you	1
want,	1
my	1
friend,	1
is	1
your	1
rights.	1
You	1
don't	1
want	1
any	1
priests	1
or	1
churches.	1
A	1
vote,	1
a	1
right	1
to	1
speak	1
is	1
what	1
you----"	1
"Who	1
says	1
I	1
a'n't	1
got	1
a	1
right	1
to	1
speak?"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
man,	1
facing	1
round	1
in	1
an	1
irrational	1
frenzy.	1
"I	1
got	1
a	1
right	1
to	1
speak.	1
I'm	1
a	1
man,	1
I	1
am.	1
I	1
don't	1
want	1
no	1
votin'	1
nor	1
priests.	1
I	1
say	1
a	1
man's	1
a	1
man;	1
that's	1
what	1
I	1
say.	1
If	1
a	1
man	1
a'n't	1
a	1
man,	1
what	1
is	1
he?	1
That's	1
what	1
I	1
say,	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
a'n't	1
a	1
man,	1
what	1
is	1
he?	1
When	1
I	1
sees	1
a	1
man,	1
I	1
sez	1
'e's	1
a	1
man."	1
"Quite	1
so,"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
"a	1
citizen."	1
"I	1
say	1
he's	1
a	1
man,"	1
said	1
the	1
rustic	1
furiously,	1
stopping	1
and	1
striking	1
his	1
stick	1
on	1
the	1
ground.	1
"Not	1
a	1
city	1
or	1
owt	1
else.	1
He's	1
a	1
man."	1
"You're	1
perfectly	1
right,"	1
said	1
the	1
sudden	1
voice	1
of	1
MacIan,	1
falling	1
like	1
a	1
sword.	1
"And	1
you	1
have	1
kept	1
close	1
to	1
something	1
the	1
whole	1
world	1
of	1
today	1
tries	1
to	1
forget."	1
"Good	1
night."	1
And	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
went	1
on	1
wildly	1
singing	1
into	1
the	1
night.	1
"A	1
jolly	1
old	1
creature,"	1
said	1
Turnbull;	1
"he	1
didn't	1
seem	1
able	1
to	1
get	1
much	1
beyond	1
that	1
fact	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
is	1
a	1
man."	1
"Has	1
anybody	1
got	1
beyond	1
it?"	1
asked	1
MacIan.	1
Turnbull	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
curiously.	1
"Are	1
you	1
turning	1
an	1
agnostic?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
"Oh,	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
understand!"	1
cried	1
out	1
MacIan.	1
"We	1
Catholics	1
are	1
all	1
agnostics.	1
We	1
Catholics	1
have	1
only	1
in	1
that	1
sense	1
got	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
realizing	1
that	1
man	1
is	1
a	1
man.	1
But	1
your	1
Ibsens	1
and	1
your	1
Zolas	1
and	1
your	1
Shaws	1
and	1
your	1
Tolstoys	1
have	1
not	1
even	1
got	1
so	1
far."	1
VIII.	1
AN	1
INTERLUDE	1
OF	1
ARGUMENT	1
Morning	1
broke	1
in	1
bitter	1
silver	1
along	1
the	1
grey	1
and	1
level	1
plain;	1
and	1
almost	1
as	1
it	1
did	1
so	1
Turnbull	1
and	1
MacIan	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
low,	1
scrubby	1
wood	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
empty	1
and	1
desolate	1
flats.	1
They	1
had	1
walked	1
all	1
night.	1
They	1
had	1
walked	1
all	1
night	1
and	1
talked	1
all	1
night	1
also,	1
and	1
if	1
the	1
subject	1
had	1
been	1
capable	1
of	1
being	1
exhausted	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
exhausted	1
it.	1
Their	1
long	1
and	1
changing	1
argument	1
had	1
taken	1
them	1
through	1
districts	1
and	1
landscapes	1
equally	1
changing.	1
They	1
had	1
discussed	1
Haeckel	1
upon	1
hills	1
so	1
high	1
and	1
steep	1
that	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
coldness	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
it	1
seemed	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
stars	1
might	1
burn	1
them.	1
They	1
had	1
explained	1
and	1
re-explained	1
the	1
Massacre	1
of	1
St.	1
Bartholomew	1
in	1
little	1
white	1
lanes	1
walled	1
in	1
with	1
standing	1
corn	1
as	1
with	1
walls	1
of	1
gold.	1
They	1
had	1
talked	1
about	1
Mr.	1
Kensit	1
in	1
dim	1
and	1
twinkling	1
pine	1
woods,	1
amid	1
the	1
bewildering	1
monotony	1
of	1
the	1
pines.	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
with	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
a	1
long	1
speech	1
from	1
MacIan,	1
passionately	1
defending	1
the	1
practical	1
achievements	1
and	1
the	1
solid	1
prosperity	1
of	1
the	1
Catholic	1
tradition,	1
that	1
they	1
came	1
out	1
upon	1
the	1
open	1
land.	1
MacIan	1
had	1
learnt	1
much	1
and	1
thought	1
more	1
since	1
he	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
cloudy	1
hills	1
of	1
Arisaig.	1
He	1
had	1
met	1
many	1
typical	1
modern	1
figures	1
under	1
circumstances	1
which	1
were	1
sharply	1
symbolic;	1
and,	1
moreover,	1
he	1
had	1
absorbed	1
the	1
main	1
modern	1
atmosphere	1
from	1
the	1
mere	1
presence	1
and	1
chance	1
phrases	1
of	1
Turnbull,	1
as	1
such	1
atmospheres	1
can	1
always	1
be	1
absorbed	1
from	1
the	1
presence	1
and	1
the	1
phrases	1
of	1
any	1
man	1
of	1
great	1
mental	1
vitality.	1
He	1
had	1
at	1
last	1
begun	1
thoroughly	1
to	1
understand	1
what	1
are	1
the	1
grounds	1
upon	1
which	1
the	1
mass	1
of	1
the	1
modern	1
world	1
solidly	1
disapprove	1
of	1
her	1
creed;	1
and	1
he	1
threw	1
himself	1
into	1
replying	1
to	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
hot	1
intellectual	1
enjoyment.	1
"I	1
begin	1
to	1
understand	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
of	1
your	1
dogmas,	1
Mr.	1
Turnbull,"	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
emphatically	1
as	1
they	1
ploughed	1
heavily	1
up	1
a	1
wooded	1
hill.	1
"And	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
I	1
understand	1
I	1
deny.	1
Take	1
any	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
you	1
like.	1
You	1
hold	1
that	1
your	1
heretics	1
and	1
sceptics	1
have	1
helped	1
the	1
world	1
forward	1
and	1
handed	1
on	1
a	1
lamp	1
of	1
progress.	1
I	1
deny	1
it.	1
Nothing	1
is	1
plainer	1
from	1
real	1
history	1
than	1
that	1
each	1
of	1
your	1
heretics	1
invented	1
a	1
complete	1
cosmos	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
which	1
the	1
next	1
heretic	1
smashed	1
entirely	1
to	1
pieces.	1
Who	1
knows	1
now	1
exactly	1
what	1
Nestorius	1
taught?	1
Who	1
cares?	1
There	1
are	1
only	1
two	1
things	1
that	1
we	1
know	1
for	1
certain	1
about	1
it.	1
The	1
first	1
is	1
that	1
Nestorius,	1
as	1
a	1
heretic,	1
taught	1
something	1
quite	1
opposite	1
to	1
the	1
teaching	1
of	1
Arius,	1
the	1
heretic	1
who	1
came	1
before	1
him,	1
and	1
something	1
quite	1
useless	1
to	1
James	1
Turnbull,	1
the	1
heretic	1
who	1
comes	1
after.	1
I	1
defy	1
you	1
to	1
go	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
Free-thinkers	1
of	1
the	1
past	1
and	1
find	1
any	1
habitation	1
for	1
yourself	1
at	1
all.	1
I	1
defy	1
you	1
to	1
read	1
Godwin	1
or	1
Shelley	1
or	1
the	1
deists	1
of	1
the	1
eighteenth	1
century	1
of	1
the	1
nature-worshipping	1
humanists	1
of	1
the	1
Renaissance,	1
without	1
discovering	1
that	1
you	1
differ	1
from	1
them	1
twice	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
you	1
differ	1
from	1
the	1
Pope.	1
You	1
are	1
a	1
nineteenth-century	1
sceptic,	1
and	1
you	1
are	1
always	1
telling	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
ignore	1
the	1
cruelty	1
of	1
nature.	1
If	1
you	1
had	1
been	1
an	1
eighteenth-century	1
sceptic	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
told	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
ignore	1
the	1
kindness	1
and	1
benevolence	1
of	1
nature.	1
You	1
are	1
an	1
atheist,	1
and	1
you	1
praise	1
the	1
deists	1
of	1
the	1
eighteenth	1
century.	1
Read	1
them	1
instead	1
of	1
praising	1
them,	1
and	1
you	1
will	1
find	1
that	1
their	1
whole	1
universe	1
stands	1
or	1
falls	1
with	1
the	1
deity.	1
You	1
are	1
a	1
materialist,	1
and	1
you	1
think	1
Bruno	1
a	1
scientific	1
hero.	1
See	1
what	1
he	1
said	1
and	1
you	1
will	1
think	1
him	1
an	1
insane	1
mystic.	1
No,	1
the	1
great	1
Free-thinker,	1
with	1
his	1
genuine	1
ability	1
and	1
honesty,	1
does	1
not	1
in	1
practice	1
destroy	1
Christianity.	1
What	1
he	1
does	1
destroy	1
is	1
the	1
Free-thinker	1
who	1
went	1
before.	1
Free-thought	1
may	1
be	1
suggestive,	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
inspiriting,	1
it	1
may	1
have	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
you	1
please	1
of	1
the	1
merits	1
that	1
come	1
from	1
vivacity	1
and	1
variety.	1
But	1
there	1
is	1
one	1
thing	1
Free-thought	1
can	1
never	1
be	1
by	1
any	1
possibility--Free-thought	1
can	1
never	1
be	1
progressive.	1
It	1
can	1
never	1
be	1
progressive	1
because	1
it	1
will	1
accept	1
nothing	1
from	1
the	1
past;	1
it	1
begins	1
every	1
time	1
again	1
from	1
the	1
beginning;	1
and	1
it	1
goes	1
every	1
time	1
in	1
a	1
different	1
direction.	1
All	1
the	1
rational	1
philosophers	1
have	1
gone	1
along	1
different	1
roads,	1
so	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
to	1
say	1
which	1
has	1
gone	1
farthest.	1
Who	1
can	1
discuss	1
whether	1
Emerson	1
was	1
a	1
better	1
optimist	1
than	1
Schopenhauer	1
was	1
pessimist?	1
It	1
is	1
like	1
asking	1
if	1
this	1
corn	1
is	1
as	1
yellow	1
as	1
that	1
hill	1
is	1
steep.	1
No;	1
there	1
are	1
only	1
two	1
things	1
that	1
really	1
progress;	1
and	1
they	1
both	1
accept	1
accumulations	1
of	1
authority.	1
They	1
may	1
be	1
progressing	1
uphill	1
and	1
down;	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
growing	1
steadily	1
better	1
or	1
steadily	1
worse;	1
but	1
they	1
have	1
steadily	1
increased	1
in	1
certain	1
definable	1
matters;	1
they	1
have	1
steadily	1
advanced	1
in	1
a	1
certain	1
definable	1
direction;	1
they	1
are	1
the	1
only	1
two	1
things,	1
it	1
seems,	1
that	1
ever	1
_can_	1
progress.	1
The	1
first	1
is	1
strictly	1
physical	1
science.	1
The	1
second	1
is	1
the	1
Catholic	1
Church."	1
"Physical	1
science	1
and	1
the	1
Catholic	1
Church!"	1
said	1
Turnbull	1
sarcastically;	1
"and	1
no	1
doubt	1
the	1
first	1
owes	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
to	1
the	1
second."	1
"If	1
you	1
pressed	1
that	1
point	1
I	1
might	1
reply	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
very	1
probable,"	1
answered	1
MacIan	1
calmly.	1
"I	1
often	1
fancy	1
that	1
your	1
historical	1
generalizations	1
rest	1
frequently	1
on	1
random	1
instances;	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
surprised	1
if	1
your	1
vague	1
notions	1
of	1
the	1
Church	1
as	1
the	1
persecutor	1
of	1
science	1
was	1
a	1
generalization	1
from	1
Galileo.	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
at	1
all	1
surprised	1
if,	1
when	1
you	1
counted	1
the	1
scientific	1
investigations	1
and	1
discoveries	1
since	1
the	1
fall	1
of	1
Rome,	1
you	1
found	1
that	1
a	1
great	1
mass	1
of	1
them	1
had	1
been	1
made	1
by	1
monks.	1
But	1
the	1
matter	1
is	1
irrelevant	1
to	1
my	1
meaning.	1
I	1
say	1
that	1
if	1
you	1
want	1
an	1
example	1
of	1
anything	1
which	1
has	1
progressed	1
in	1
the	1
moral	1
world	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
method	1
as	1
science	1
in	1
the	1
material	1
world,	1
by	1
continually	1
adding	1
to	1
without	1
unsettling	1
what	1
was	1
there	1
before,	1
then	1
I	1
say	1
that	1
there	1
_is_	1
only	1
one	1
example	1
of	1
it.	1
And	1
that	1
is	1
Us."	1
"With	1
this	1
enormous	1
difference,"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
"that	1
however	1
elaborate	1
be	1
the	1
calculations	1
of	1
physical	1
science,	1
their	1
net	1
result	1
can	1
be	1
tested.	1
Granted	1
that	1
it	1
took	1
millions	1
of	1
books	1
I	1
never	1
read	1
and	1
millions	1
of	1
men	1
I	1
never	1
heard	1
of	1
to	1
discover	1
the	1
electric	1
light.	1
Still	1
I	1
can	1
see	1
the	1
electric	1
light.	1
But	1
I	1
cannot	1
see	1
the	1
supreme	1
virtue	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
all	1
your	1
theologies	1
and	1
sacraments."	1
"Catholic	1
virtue	1
is	1
often	1
invisible	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
normal,"	1
answered	1
MacIan.	1
"Christianity	1
is	1
always	1
out	1
of	1
fashion	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
always	1
sane;	1
and	1
all	1
fashions	1
are	1
mild	1
insanities.	1
When	1
Italy	1
is	1
mad	1
on	1
art	1
the	1
Church	1
seems	1
too	1
Puritanical;	1
when	1
England	1
is	1
mad	1
on	1
Puritanism	1
the	1
Church	1
seems	1
too	1
artistic.	1
When	1
you	1
quarrel	1
with	1
us	1
now	1
you	1
class	1
us	1
with	1
kingship	1
and	1
despotism;	1
but	1
when	1
you	1
quarrelled	1
with	1
us	1
first	1
it	1
was	1
because	1
we	1
would	1
not	1
accept	1
the	1
divine	1
despotism	1
of	1
Henry	1
VIII.	1
The	1
Church	1
always	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
behind	1
the	1
times,	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
really	1
beyond	1
the	1
times;	1
it	1
is	1
waiting	1
till	1
the	1
last	1
fad	1
shall	1
have	1
seen	1
its	1
last	1
summer.	1
It	1
keeps	1
the	1
key	1
of	1
a	1
permanent	1
virtue."	1
"Oh,	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
all	1
that!"	1
said	1
Turnbull	1
with	1
genial	1
contempt.	1
"I	1
have	1
heard	1
that	1
Christianity	1
keeps	1
the	1
key	1
of	1
virtue,	1
and	1
that	1
if	1
you	1
read	1
Tom	1
Paine	1
you	1
will	1
cut	1
your	1
throat	1
at	1
Monte	1
Carlo.	1
It	1
is	1
such	1
rubbish	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
even	1
angry	1
at	1
it.	1
You	1
say	1
that	1
Christianity	1
is	1
the	1
prop	1
of	1
morals;	1
but	1
what	1
more	1
do	1
you	1
do?	1
When	1
a	1
doctor	1
attends	1
you	1
and	1
could	1
poison	1
you	1
with	1
a	1
pinch	1
of	1
salt,	1
do	1
you	1
ask	1
whether	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
Christian?	1
You	1
ask	1
whether	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
gentleman,	1
whether	1
he	1
is	1
an	1
M.D.--anything	1
but	1
that.	1
When	1
a	1
soldier	1
enlists	1
to	1
die	1
for	1
his	1
country	1
or	1
disgrace	1
it,	1
do	1
you	1
ask	1
whether	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
Christian?	1
You	1
are	1
more	1
likely	1
to	1
ask	1
whether	1
he	1
is	1
Oxford	1
or	1
Cambridge	1
at	1
the	1
boat	1
race.	1
If	1
you	1
think	1
your	1
creed	1
essential	1
to	1
morals	1
why	1
do	1
you	1
not	1
make	1
it	1
a	1
test	1
for	1
these	1
things?"	1
"We	1
once	1
did	1
make	1
it	1
a	1
test	1
for	1
these	1
things,"	1
said	1
MacIan	1
smiling,	1
"and	1
then	1
you	1
told	1
us	1
that	1
we	1
were	1
imposing	1
by	1
force	1
a	1
faith	1
unsupported	1
by	1
argument.	1
It	1
seems	1
rather	1
hard	1
that	1
having	1
first	1
been	1
told	1
that	1
our	1
creed	1
must	1
be	1
false	1
because	1
we	1
did	1
use	1
tests,	1
we	1
should	1
now	1
be	1
told	1
that	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
false	1
because	1
we	1
don't.	1
But	1
I	1
notice	1
that	1
most	1
anti-Christian	1
arguments	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
inconsistent	1
style."	1
"That	1
is	1
all	1
very	1
well	1
as	1
a	1
debating-club	1
answer,"	1
replied	1
Turnbull	1
good-humouredly,	1
"but	1
the	1
question	1
still	1
remains:	1
Why	1
don't	1
you	1
confine	1
yourself	1
more	1
to	1
Christians	1
if	1
Christians	1
are	1
the	1
only	1
really	1
good	1
men?"	1
"Who	1
talked	1
of	1
such	1
folly?"	1
asked	1
MacIan	1
disdainfully.	1
"Do	1
you	1
suppose	1
that	1
the	1
Catholic	1
Church	1
ever	1
held	1
that	1
Christians	1
were	1
the	1
only	1
good	1
men?	1
Why,	1
the	1
Catholics	1
of	1
the	1
Catholic	1
Middle	1
Ages	1
talked	1
about	1
the	1
virtues	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
virtuous	1
Pagans	1
until	1
humanity	1
was	1
sick	1
of	1
the	1
subject.	1
No,	1
if	1
you	1
really	1
want	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
we	1
mean	1
when	1
we	1
say	1
that	1
Christianity	1
has	1
a	1
special	1
power	1
of	1
virtue,	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
you.	1
The	1
Church	1
is	1
the	1
only	1
thing	1
on	1
earth	1
that	1
can	1
perpetuate	1
a	1
type	1
of	1
virtue	1
and	1
make	1
it	1
something	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
fashion.	1
The	1
thing	1
is	1
so	1
plain	1
and	1
historical	1
that	1
I	1
hardly	1
think	1
you	1
will	1
ever	1
deny	1
it.	1
You	1
cannot	1
deny	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
perfectly	1
possible	1
that	1
tomorrow	1
morning,	1
in	1
Ireland	1
or	1
in	1
Italy,	1
there	1
might	1
appear	1
a	1
man	1
not	1
only	1
as	1
good	1
but	1
good	1
in	1
exactly	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
as	1
St.	1
Francis	1
of	1
Assisi.	1
Very	1
well,	1
now	1
take	1
the	1
other	1
types	1
of	1
human	1
virtue;	1
many	1
of	1
them	1
splendid.	1
The	1
English	1
gentleman	1
of	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
chivalrous	1
and	1
idealistic.	1
But	1
can	1
you	1
stand	1
still	1
here	1
in	1
this	1
meadow	1
and	1
_be_	1
an	1
English	1
gentleman	1
of	1
Elizabeth?	1
The	1
austere	1
republican	1
of	1
the	1
eighteenth	1
century,	1
with	1
his	1
stern	1
patriotism	1
and	1
his	1
simple	1
life,	1
was	1
a	1
fine	1
fellow.	1
But	1
have	1
you	1
ever	1
seen	1
him?	1
have	1
you	1
ever	1
seen	1
an	1
austere	1
republican?	1
Only	1
a	1
hundred	1
years	1
have	1
passed	1
and	1
that	1
volcano	1
of	1
revolutionary	1
truth	1
and	1
valour	1
is	1
as	1
cold	1
as	1
the	1
mountains	1
of	1
the	1
moon.	1
And	1
so	1
it	1
is	1
and	1
so	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
with	1
the	1
ethics	1
which	1
are	1
buzzing	1
down	1
Fleet	1
Street	1
at	1
this	1
instant	1
as	1
I	1
speak.	1
What	1
phrase	1
would	1
inspire	1
the	1
London	1
clerk	1
or	1
workman	1
just	1
now?	1
Perhaps	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
son	1
of	1
the	1
British	1
Empire	1
on	1
which	1
the	1
sun	1
never	1
sets;	1
perhaps	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
prop	1
of	1
his	1
Trades	1
Union,	1
or	1
a	1
class-conscious	1
proletarian	1
something	1
or	1
other;	1
perhaps	1
merely	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
gentleman	1
when	1
he	1
obviously	1
is	1
not.	1
Those	1
names	1
and	1
notions	1
are	1
all	1
honourable;	1
but	1
how	1
long	1
will	1
they	1
last?	1
Empires	1
break;	1
industrial	1
conditions	1
change;	1
the	1
suburbs	1
will	1
not	1
last	1
for	1
ever.	1
What	1
will	1
remain?	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
you.	1
The	1
Catholic	1
Saint	1
will	1
remain."	1
"And	1
suppose	1
I	1
don't	1
like	1
him?"	1
said	1
Turnbull.	1
"On	1
my	1
theory	1
the	1
question	1
is	1
rather	1
whether	1
he	1
will	1
like	1
you:	1
or	1
more	1
probably	1
whether	1
he	1
will	1
ever	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
you.	1
But	1
I	1
grant	1
the	1
reasonableness	1
of	1
your	1
query.	1
You	1
have	1
a	1
right,	1
if	1
you	1
speak	1
as	1
the	1
ordinary	1
man,	1
to	1
ask	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
like	1
the	1
saint.	1
But	1
as	1
the	1
ordinary	1
man	1
you	1
do	1
like	1
him.	1
You	1
revel	1
in	1
him.	1
If	1
you	1
dislike	1
him	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
because	1
you	1
are	1
a	1
nice	1
ordinary	1
man,	1
but	1
because	1
you	1
are	1
(if	1
you	1
will	1
excuse	1
me)	1
a	1
sophisticated	1
prig	1
of	1
a	1
Fleet	1
Street	1
editor.	1
That	1
is	1
just	1
the	1
funny	1
part	1
of	1
it.	1
The	1
human	1
race	1
has	1
always	1
admired	1
the	1
Catholic	1
virtues,	1
however	1
little	1
it	1
can	1
practise	1
them;	1
and	1
oddly	1
enough	1
it	1
has	1
admired	1
most	1
those	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
the	1
modern	1
world	1
most	1
sharply	1
disputes.	1
You	1
complain	1
of	1
Catholicism	1
for	1
setting	1
up	1
an	1
ideal	1
of	1
virginity;	1
it	1
did	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
kind.	1
The	1
whole	1
human	1
race	1
set	1
up	1
an	1
ideal	1
of	1
virginity;	1
the	1
Greeks	1
in	1
Athene,	1
the	1
Romans	1
in	1
the	1
Vestal	1
fire,	1
set	1
up	1
an	1
ideal	1
of	1
virginity.	1
What	1
then	1
is	1
your	1
real	1
quarrel	1
with	1
Catholicism?	1
Your	1
quarrel	1
can	1
only	1
be,	1
your	1
quarrel	1
really	1
only	1
is,	1
that	1
Catholicism	1
has	1
_achieved_	1
an	1
ideal	1
of	1
virginity;	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
longer	1
a	1
mere	1
piece	1
of	1
floating	1
poetry.	1
But	1
if	1
you,	1
and	1
a	1
few	1
feverish	1
men,	1
in	1
top	1
hats,	1
running	1
about	1
in	1
a	1
street	1
in	1
London,	1
choose	1
to	1
differ	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
ideal	1
itself,	1
not	1
only	1
from	1
the	1
Church,	1
but	1
from	1
the	1
Parthenon	1
whose	1
name	1
means	1
virginity,	1
from	1
the	1
Roman	1
Empire	1
which	1
went	1
outwards	1
from	1
the	1
virgin	1
flame,	1
from	1
the	1
whole	1
legend	1
and	1
tradition	1
of	1
Europe,	1
from	1
the	1
lion	1
who	1
will	1
not	1
touch	1
virgins,	1
from	1
the	1
unicorn	1
who	1
respects	1
them,	1
and	1
who	1
make	1
up	1
together	1
the	1
bearers	1
of	1
your	1
own	1
national	1
shield,	1
from	1
the	1
most	1
living	1
and	1
lawless	1
of	1
your	1
own	1
poets,	1
from	1
Massinger,	1
who	1
wrote	1
the	1
_Virgin	1
Martyr_,	1
from	1
Shakespeare,	1
who	1
wrote	1
_Measure	1
for	1
Measure_--if	1
you	1
in	1
Fleet	1
Street	1
differ	1
from	1
all	1
this	1
human	1
experience,	1
does	1
it	1
never	1
strike	1
you	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
Fleet	1
Street	1
that	1
is	1
wrong?"	1
"No,"	1
answered	1
Turnbull;	1
"I	1
trust	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
sufficiently	1
fair-minded	1
to	1
canvass	1
and	1
consider	1
the	1
idea;	1
but	1
having	1
considered	1
it,	1
I	1
think	1
Fleet	1
Street	1
is	1
right,	1
yes--even	1
if	1
the	1
Parthenon	1
is	1
wrong.	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
as	1
the	1
world	1
goes	1
on	1
new	1
psychological	1
atmospheres	1
are	1
generated,	1
and	1
in	1
these	1
atmospheres	1
it	1
is	1
possible	1
to	1
find	1
delicacies	1
and	1
combinations	1
which	1
in	1
other	1
times	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
be	1
represented	1
by	1
some	1
ruder	1
symbol.	1
Every	1
man	1
feels	1
the	1
need	1
of	1
some	1
element	1
of	1
purity	1
in	1
sex;	1
perhaps	1
they	1
can	1
only	1
typify	1
purity	1
as	1
the	1
absence	1
of	1
sex.	1
You	1
will	1
laugh	1
if	1
I	1
suggest	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
have	1
made	1
in	1
Fleet	1
Street	1
an	1
atmosphere	1
in	1
which	1
a	1
man	1
can	1
be	1
so	1
passionate	1
as	1
Sir	1
Lancelot	1
and	1
as	1
pure	1
as	1
Sir	1
Galahad.	1
But,	1
after	1
all,	1
we	1
have	1
in	1
the	1
modern	1
world	1
erected	1
many	1
such	1
atmospheres.	1
We	1
have,	1
for	1
instance,	1
a	1
new	1
and	1
imaginative	1
appreciation	1
of	1
children."	1
"Quite	1
so,"	1
replied	1
MacIan	1
with	1
a	1
singular	1
smile.	1
"It	1
has	1
been	1
very	1
well	1
put	1
by	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
brightest	1
of	1
your	1
young	1
authors,	1
who	1
said:	1
'Unless	1
you	1
become	1
as	1
little	1
children	1
ye	1
shall	1
in	1
no	1
wise	1
enter	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven.'	1
But	1
you	1
are	1
quite	1
right;	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
modern	1
worship	1
of	1
children.	1
And	1
what,	1
I	1
ask	1
you,	1
is	1
this	1
modern	1
worship	1
of	1
children?	1
What,	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
angels	1
and	1
devils,	1
is	1
it	1
except	1
a	1
worship	1
of	1
virginity?	1
Why	1
should	1
anyone	1
worship	1
a	1
thing	1
merely	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
small	1
or	1
immature?	1
No;	1
you	1
have	1
tried	1
to	1
escape	1
from	1
this	1
thing,	1
and	1
the	1
very	1
thing	1
you	1
point	1
to	1
as	1
the	1
goal	1
of	1
your	1
escape	1
is	1
only	1
the	1
thing	1
again.	1
Am	1
I	1
wrong	1
in	1
saying	1
that	1
these	1
things	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
eternal?"	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
with	1
these	1
words	1
that	1
they	1
came	1
in	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
plains.	1
They	1
went	1
a	1
little	1
way	1
in	1
silence,	1
and	1
then	1
James	1
Turnbull	1
said	1
suddenly,	1
"But	1
I	1
_cannot_	1
believe	1
in	1
the	1
thing."	1
MacIan	1
answered	1
nothing	1
to	1
the	1
speech;	1
perhaps	1
it	1
is	1
unanswerable.	1
And	1
indeed	1
they	1
scarcely	1
spoke	1
another	1
word	1
to	1
each	1
other	1
all	1
that	1
day.	1
IX.	1
THE	1
STRANGE	1
LADY	1
Moonrise	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
and	1
growing	1
moon	1
opened	1
over	1
all	1
those	1
flats,	1
making	1
them	1
seem	1
flatter	1
and	1
larger	1
than	1
they	1
were,	1
turning	1
them	1
to	1
a	1
lake	1
of	1
blue	1
light.	1
The	1
two	1
companions	1
trudged	1
across	1
the	1
moonlit	1
plain	1
for	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
in	1
full	1
silence.	1
Then	1
MacIan	1
stopped	1
suddenly	1
and	1
planted	1
his	1
sword-point	1
in	1
the	1
ground	1
like	1
one	1
who	1
plants	1
his	1
tent-pole	1
for	1
the	1
night.	1
Leaving	1
it	1
standing	1
there,	1
he	1
clutched	1
his	1
black-haired	1
skull	1
with	1
his	1
great	1
claws	1
of	1
hands,	1
as	1
was	1
his	1
custom	1
when	1
forcing	1
the	1
pace	1
of	1
his	1
brain.	1
Then	1
his	1
hands	1
dropped	1
again	1
and	1
he	1
spoke.	1
"I'm	1
sure	1
you're	1
thinking	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
I	1
am,"	1
he	1
said;	1
"how	1
long	1
are	1
we	1
to	1
be	1
on	1
this	1
damned	1
seesaw?"	1
The	1
other	1
did	1
not	1
answer,	1
but	1
his	1
silence	1
seemed	1
somehow	1
solid	1
as	1
assent;	1
and	1
MacIan	1
went	1
on	1
conversationally.	1
Neither	1
noticed	1
that	1
both	1
had	1
instinctively	1
stood	1
still	1
before	1
the	1
sign	1
of	1
the	1
fixed	1
and	1
standing	1
sword.	1
"It	1
is	1
hard	1
to	1
guess	1
what	1
God	1
means	1
in	1
this	1
business.	1
But	1
he	1
means	1
something--or	1
the	1
other	1
thing,	1
or	1
both.	1
Whenever	1
we	1
have	1
tried	1
to	1
fight	1
each	1
other	1
something	1
has	1
stopped	1
us.	1
Whenever	1
we	1
have	1
tried	1
to	1
be	1
reconciled	1
to	1
each	1
other,	1
something	1
has	1
stopped	1
us	1
again.	1
By	1
the	1
run	1
of	1
our	1
luck	1
we	1
have	1
never	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
be	1
either	1
friends	1
or	1
enemies.	1
Something	1
always	1
jumped	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
bushes."	1
Turnbull	1
nodded	1
gravely	1
and	1
glanced	1
round	1
at	1
the	1
huge	1
and	1
hedgeless	1
meadow	1
which	1
fell	1
away	1
towards	1
the	1
horizon	1
into	1
a	1
glimmering	1
high	1
road.	1
"Nothing	1
will	1
jump	1
out	1
of	1
bushes	1
here	1
anyhow,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"That	1
is	1
what	1
I	1
meant,"	1
said	1
MacIan,	1
and	1
stared	1
steadily	1
at	1
the	1
heavy	1
hilt	1
of	1
his	1
standing	1
sword,	1
which	1
in	1
the	1
slight	1
wind	1
swayed	1
on	1
its	1
tempered	1
steel	1
like	1
some	1
huge	1
thistle	1
on	1
its	1
stalk.	1
"That	1
is	1
what	1
I	1
meant;	1
we	1
are	1
quite	1
alone	1
here.	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
heard	1
a	1
horse-hoof	1
or	1
a	1
footstep	1
or	1
the	1
hoot	1
of	1
a	1
train	1
for	1
miles.	1
So	1
I	1
think	1
we	1
might	1
stop	1
here	1
and	1
ask	1
for	1
a	1
miracle."	1
"Oh!	1
might	1
we?"	1
said	1
the	1
atheistic	1
editor	1
with	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
gusto	1
of	1
disgust.	1
"I	1
beg	1
your	1
pardon,"	1
said	1
MacIan,	1
meekly.	1
"I	1
forgot	1
your	1
prejudices."	1
He	1
eyed	1
the	1
wind-swung	1
sword-hilt	1
in	1
sad	1
meditation	1
and	1
resumed:	1
"What	1
I	1
mean	1
is,	1
we	1
might	1
find	1
out	1
in	1
this	1
quiet	1
place	1
whether	1
there	1
really	1
is	1
any	1
fate	1
or	1
any	1
commandment	1
against	1
our	1
enterprise.	1
I	1
will	1
engage	1
on	1
my	1
side,	1
like	1
Elijah,	1
to	1
accept	1
a	1
test	1
from	1
heaven.	1
Turnbull,	1
let	1
us	1
draw	1
swords	1
here	1
in	1
this	1
moonlight	1
and	1
this	1
monstrous	1
solitude.	1
And	1
if	1
here	1
in	1
this	1
moonlight	1
and	1
solitude	1
there	1
happens	1
anything	1
to	1
interrupt	1
us--if	1
it	1
be	1
lightning	1
striking	1
our	1
sword-blades	1
or	1
a	1
rabbit	1
running	1
under	1
our	1
legs--I	1
will	1
take	1
it	1
as	1
a	1
sign	1
from	1
God	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
shake	1
hands	1
for	1
ever."	1
Turnbull's	1
mouth	1
twitched	1
in	1
angry	1
humour	1
under	1
his	1
red	1
moustache.	1
He	1
said:	1
"I	1
will	1
wait	1
for	1
signs	1
from	1
God	1
until	1
I	1
have	1
any	1
signs	1
of	1
His	1
existence;	1
but	1
God--or	1
Fate--forbid	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
scientific	1
culture	1
should	1
refuse	1
any	1
kind	1
of	1
experiment."	1
"Very	1
well,	1
then,"	1
said	1
MacIan,	1
shortly.	1
"We	1
are	1
more	1
quiet	1
here	1
than	1
anywhere	1
else;	1
let	1
us	1
engage."	1
And	1
he	1
plucked	1
his	1
sword-point	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
turf.	1
Turnbull	1
regarded	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
second	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
with	1
a	1
baffling	1
visage	1
almost	1
black	1
against	1
the	1
moonrise;	1
then	1
his	1
hand	1
made	1
a	1
sharp	1
movement	1
to	1
his	1
hip	1
and	1
his	1
sword	1
shone	1
in	1
the	1
moon.	1
As	1
old	1
chess-players	1
open	1
every	1
game	1
with	1
established	1
gambits,	1
they	1
opened	1
with	1
a	1
thrust	1
and	1
parry,	1
orthodox	1
and	1
even	1
frankly	1
ineffectual.	1
But	1
in	1
MacIan's	1
soul	1
more	1
formless	1
storms	1
were	1
gathering,	1
and	1
he	1
made	1
a	1
lunge	1
or	1
two	1
so	1
savage	1
as	1
first	1
to	1
surprise	1
and	1
then	1
to	1
enrage	1
his	1
opponent.	1
Turnbull	1
ground	1
his	1
teeth,	1
kept	1
his	1
temper,	1
and	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
third	1
lunge,	1
and	1
the	1
worst,	1
had	1
almost	1
spitted	1
the	1
lunger	1
when	1
a	1
shrill,	1
small	1
cry	1
came	1
from	1
behind	1
him,	1
a	1
cry	1
such	1
as	1
is	1
not	1
made	1
by	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
beasts	1
that	1
perish.	1
Turnbull	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
more	1
superstitious	1
than	1
he	1
knew,	1
for	1
he	1
stopped	1
in	1
the	1
act	1
of	1
going	1
forward.	1
MacIan	1
was	1
brazenly	1
superstitious,	1
and	1
he	1
dropped	1
his	1
sword.	1
After	1
all,	1
he	1
had	1
challenged	1
the	1
universe	1
to	1
send	1
an	1
interruption;	1
and	1
this	1
was	1
an	1
interruption,	1
whatever	1
else	1
it	1
was.	1
An	1
instant	1
afterwards	1
the	1
sharp,	1
weak	1
cry	1
was	1
repeated.	1
This	1
time	1
it	1
was	1
certain	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
human	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
female.	1
MacIan	1
stood	1
rolling	1
those	1
great	1
blue	1
Gaelic	1
eyes	1
that	1
contrasted	1
with	1
his	1
dark	1
hair.	1
"It	1
is	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
God,"	1
he	1
said	1
again	1
and	1
again.	1
"God	1
hasn't	1
got	1
much	1
of	1
a	1
voice,"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
who	1
snatched	1
at	1
every	1
chance	1
of	1
cheap	1
profanity.	1
"As	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
fact,	1
MacIan,	1
it	1
isn't	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
God,	1
but	1
it's	1
something	1
a	1
jolly	1
sight	1
more	1
important--it	1
is	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
man--or	1
rather	1
of	1
woman.	1
So	1
I	1
think	1
we'd	1
better	1
scoot	1
in	1
its	1
direction."	1
MacIan	1
snatched	1
up	1
his	1
fallen	1
weapon	1
without	1
a	1
word,	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
raced	1
away	1
towards	1
that	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
distant	1
road	1
from	1
which	1
the	1
cry	1
was	1
now	1
constantly	1
renewed.	1
They	1
had	1
to	1
run	1
over	1
a	1
curve	1
of	1
country	1
that	1
looked	1
smooth	1
but	1
was	1
very	1
rough;	1
a	1
neglected	1
field	1
which	1
they	1
soon	1
found	1
to	1
be	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
tallest	1
grasses	1
and	1
the	1
deepest	1
rabbit-holes.	1
Moreover,	1
that	1
great	1
curve	1
of	1
the	1
countryside	1
which	1
looked	1
so	1
slow	1
and	1
gentle	1
when	1
you	1
glanced	1
over	1
it,	1
proved	1
to	1
be	1
highly	1
precipitous	1
when	1
you	1
scampered	1
over	1
it;	1
and	1
Turnbull	1
was	1
twice	1
nearly	1
flung	1
on	1
his	1
face.	1
MacIan,	1
though	1
much	1
heavier,	1
avoided	1
such	1
an	1
overthrow	1
only	1
by	1
having	1
the	1
quick	1
and	1
incalculable	1
feet	1
of	1
the	1
mountaineer;	1
but	1
both	1
of	1
them	1
may	1
be	1
said	1
to	1
have	1
leapt	1
off	1
a	1
low	1
cliff	1
when	1
they	1
leapt	1
into	1
the	1
road.	1
The	1
moonlight	1
lay	1
on	1
the	1
white	1
road	1
with	1
a	1
more	1
naked	1
and	1
electric	1
glare	1
than	1
on	1
the	1
grey-green	1
upland,	1
and	1
though	1
the	1
scene	1
which	1
it	1
revealed	1
was	1
complicated,	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
difficult	1
to	1
get	1
its	1
first	1
features	1
at	1
a	1
glance.	1
A	1
small	1
but	1
very	1
neat	1
black-and-yellow	1
motor-car	1
was	1
standing	1
stolidly,	1
slightly	1
to	1
the	1
left	1
of	1
the	1
road.	1
A	1
somewhat	1
larger	1
light-green	1
motor-car	1
was	1
tipped	1
half-way	1
into	1
a	1
ditch	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
side,	1
and	1
four	1
flushed	1
and	1
staggering	1
men	1
in	1
evening	1
dress	1
were	1
tipped	1
out	1
of	1
it.	1
Three	1
of	1
them	1
were	1
standing	1
about	1
the	1
road,	1
giving	1
their	1
opinions	1
to	1
the	1
moon	1
with	1
vague	1
but	1
echoing	1
violence.	1
The	1
fourth,	1
however,	1
had	1
already	1
advanced	1
on	1
the	1
chauffeur	1
of	1
the	1
black-and-yellow	1
car,	1
and	1
was	1
threatening	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
stick.	1
The	1
chauffeur	1
had	1
risen	1
to	1
defend	1
himself.	1
By	1
his	1
side	1
sat	1
a	1
young	1
lady.	1
She	1
was	1
sitting	1
bolt	1
upright,	1
a	1
slender	1
and	1
rigid	1
figure	1
gripping	1
the	1
sides	1
of	1
her	1
seat,	1
and	1
her	1
first	1
few	1
cries	1
had	1
ceased.	1
She	1
was	1
clad	1
in	1
close-fitting	1
dark	1
costume,	1
a	1
mass	1
of	1
warm	1
brown	1
hair	1
went	1
out	1
in	1
two	1
wings	1
or	1
waves	1
on	1
each	1
side	1
of	1
her	1
forehead;	1
and	1
even	1
at	1
that	1
distance	1
it	1
could	1
be	1
seen	1
that	1
her	1
profile	1
was	1
of	1
the	1
aquiline	1
and	1
eager	1
sort,	1
like	1
a	1
young	1
falcon	1
hardly	1
free	1
of	1
the	1
nest.	1
Turnbull	1
had	1
concealed	1
in	1
him	1
somewhere	1
a	1
fund	1
of	1
common	1
sense	1
and	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
himself	1
and	1
his	1
best	1
friends	1
were	1
hardly	1
aware.	1
He	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
take	1
in	1
much	1
of	1
the	1
shows	1
of	1
things	1
absent-mindedly,	1
and	1
in	1
an	1
irrelevant	1
reverie.	1
As	1
he	1
stood	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
his	1
editorial	1
shop	1
on	1
Ludgate	1
Hill	1
and	1
meditated	1
on	1
the	1
non-existence	1
of	1
God,	1
he	1
silently	1
absorbed	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
of	1
varied	1
knowledge	1
about	1
the	1
existence	1
of	1
men.	1
He	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
know	1
types	1
by	1
instinct	1
and	1
dilemmas	1
with	1
a	1
glance;	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
crux	1
of	1
the	1
situation	1
in	1
the	1
road,	1
and	1
what	1
he	1
saw	1
made	1
him	1
redouble	1
his	1
pace.	1
He	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
men	1
were	1
rich;	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
drunk;	1
and	1
he	1
knew,	1
what	1
was	1
worst	1
of	1
all,	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
fundamentally	1
frightened.	1
And	1
he	1
knew	1
this	1
also,	1
that	1
no	1
common	1
ruffian	1
(such	1
as	1
attacks	1
ladies	1
in	1
novels)	1
is	1
ever	1
so	1
savage	1
and	1
ruthless	1
as	1
a	1
coarse	1
kind	1
of	1
gentleman	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
really	1
alarmed.	1
The	1
reason	1
is	1
not	1
recondite;	1
it	1
is	1
simply	1
because	1
the	1
police-court	1
is	1
not	1
such	1
a	1
menacing	1
novelty	1
to	1
the	1
poor	1
ruffian	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
the	1
rich.	1
When	1
they	1
came	1
within	1
hail	1
and	1
heard	1
the	1
voices,	1
they	1
confirmed	1
all	1
Turnbull's	1
anticipations.	1
The	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
road	1
was	1
shouting	1
in	1
a	1
hoarse	1
and	1
groggy	1
voice	1
that	1
the	1
chauffeur	1
had	1
smashed	1
their	1
car	1
on	1
purpose;	1
that	1
they	1
must	1
get	1
to	1
the	1
Cri	1
that	1
evening,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
jolly	1
well	1
have	1
to	1
take	1
them	1
there.	1
The	1
chauffeur	1
had	1
mildly	1
objected	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
driving	1
a	1
lady.	1
"Oh!	1
we'll	1
take	1
care	1
of	1
the	1
lady,"	1
said	1
the	1
red-faced	1
young	1
man,	1
and	1
went	1
off	1
into	1
gurgling	1
and	1
almost	1
senile	1
laughter.	1
By	1
the	1
time	1
the	1
two	1
champions	1
came	1
up,	1
things	1
had	1
grown	1
more	1
serious.	1
The	1
intoxication	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
talking	1
to	1
the	1
chauffeur	1
had	1
taken	1
one	1
of	1
its	1
perverse	1
and	1
catlike	1
jumps	1
into	1
mere	1
screaming	1
spite	1
and	1
rage.	1
He	1
lifted	1
his	1
stick	1
and	1
struck	1
at	1
the	1
chauffeur,	1
who	1
caught	1
hold	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
the	1
drunkard	1
fell	1
backwards,	1
dragging	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
seat	1
on	1
the	1
car.	1
Another	1
of	1
the	1
rowdies	1
rushed	1
forward	1
booing	1
in	1
idiot	1
excitement,	1
fell	1
over	1
the	1
chauffeur,	1
and,	1
either	1
by	1
accident	1
or	1
design,	1
kicked	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
lay.	1
The	1
drunkard	1
got	1
to	1
his	1
feet	1
again;	1
but	1
the	1
chauffeur	1
did	1
not.	1
The	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
kicked	1
kept	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
half-witted	1
conscience	1
or	1
cowardice,	1
for	1
he	1
stood	1
staring	1
at	1
the	1
senseless	1
body	1
and	1
murmuring	1
words	1
of	1
inconsequent	1
self-justification,	1
making	1
gestures	1
with	1
his	1
hands	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
arguing	1
with	1
somebody.	1
But	1
the	1
other	1
three,	1
with	1
a	1
mere	1
whoop	1
and	1
howl	1
of	1
victory,	1
were	1
boarding	1
the	1
car	1
on	1
three	1
sides	1
at	1
once.	1
It	1
was	1
exactly	1
at	1
this	1
moment	1
that	1
Turnbull	1
fell	1
among	1
them	1
like	1
one	1
fallen	1
from	1
the	1
sky.	1
He	1
tore	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
climbers	1
backward	1
by	1
the	1
collar,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
hearty	1
push	1
sent	1
him	1
staggering	1
over	1
into	1
the	1
ditch	1
upon	1
his	1
nose.	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
remaining	1
two,	1
who	1
was	1
too	1
far	1
gone	1
to	1
notice	1
anything,	1
continued	1
to	1
clamber	1
ineffectually	1
over	1
the	1
high	1
back	1
of	1
the	1
car,	1
kicking	1
and	1
pouring	1
forth	1
a	1
rivulet	1
of	1
soliloquy.	1
But	1
the	1
other	1
dropped	1
at	1
the	1
interruption,	1
turned	1
upon	1
Turnbull	1
and	1
began	1
a	1
battering	1
bout	1
of	1
fisticuffs.	1
At	1
the	1
same	1
moment	1
the	1
man	1
crawled	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
ditch	1
in	1
a	1
masquerade	1
of	1
mud	1
and	1
rushed	1
at	1
his	1
old	1
enemy	1
from	1
behind.	1
The	1
whole	1
had	1
not	1
taken	1
a	1
second;	1
and	1
an	1
instant	1
after	1
MacIan	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
them.	1
Turnbull	1
had	1
tossed	1
away	1
his	1
sheathed	1
sword,	1
greatly	1
preferring	1
his	1
hands,	1
except	1
in	1
the	1
avowed	1
etiquette	1
of	1
the	1
duel;	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
learnt	1
to	1
use	1
his	1
hands	1
in	1
the	1
old	1
street-battles	1
of	1
Bradlaugh.	1
But	1
to	1
MacIan	1
the	1
sword	1
even	1
sheathed	1
was	1
a	1
more	1
natural	1
weapon,	1
and	1
he	1
laid	1
about	1
him	1
on	1
all	1
sides	1
with	1
it	1
as	1
with	1
a	1
stick.	1
The	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
the	1
walking-stick	1
found	1
his	1
blows	1
parried	1
with	1
promptitude;	1
and	1
a	1
second	1
after,	1
to	1
his	1
great	1
astonishment,	1
found	1
his	1
own	1
stick	1
fly	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
air	1
as	1
by	1
a	1
conjuring	1
trick,	1
with	1
a	1
turn	1
of	1
the	1
swordsman's	1
wrist.	1
Another	1
of	1
the	1
revellers	1
picked	1
the	1
stick	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
ditch	1
and	1
ran	1
in	1
upon	1
MacIan,	1
calling	1
to	1
his	1
companion	1
to	1
assist	1
him.	1
"I	1
haven't	1
got	1
a	1
stick,"	1
grumbled	1
the	1
disarmed	1
man,	1
and	1
looked	1
vaguely	1
about	1
the	1
ditch.	1
"Perhaps,"	1
said	1
MacIan,	1
politely,	1
"you	1
would	1
like	1
this	1
one."	1
With	1
the	1
word	1
the	1
drunkard	1
found	1
his	1
hand	1
that	1
had	1
grasped	1
the	1
stick	1
suddenly	1
twisted	1
and	1
empty;	1
and	1
the	1
stick	1
lay	1
at	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
his	1
companion	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
road.	1
MacIan	1
felt	1
a	1
faint	1
stir	1
behind	1
him;	1
the	1
girl	1
had	1
risen	1
to	1
her	1
feet	1
and	1
was	1
leaning	1
forward	1
to	1
stare	1
at	1
the	1
fighters.	1
Turnbull	1
was	1
still	1
engaged	1
in	1
countering	1
and	1
pommelling	1
with	1
the	1
third	1
young	1
man.	1
The	1
fourth	1
young	1
man	1
was	1
still	1
engaged	1
with	1
himself,	1
kicking	1
his	1
legs	1
in	1
helpless	1
rotation	1
on	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
the	1
car	1
and	1
talking	1
with	1
melodious	1
rationality.	1
At	1
length	1
Turnbull's	1
opponent	1
began	1
to	1
back	1
before	1
the	1
battery	1
of	1
his	1
heavy	1
hands,	1
still	1
fighting,	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
soberest	1
and	1
boldest	1
of	1
the	1
four.	1
If	1
these	1
are	1
annals	1
of	1
military	1
glory,	1
it	1
is	1
due	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
he	1
need	1
not	1
have	1
abandoned	1
the	1
conflict;	1
only	1
that	1
as	1
he	1
backed	1
to	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
ditch	1
his	1
foot	1
caught	1
in	1
a	1
loop	1
of	1
grass	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
over	1
in	1
a	1
flat	1
and	1
comfortable	1
position	1
from	1
which	1
it	1
took	1
him	1
a	1
considerable	1
time	1
to	1
rise.	1
By	1
the	1
time	1
he	1
had	1
risen,	1
Turnbull	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
rescue	1
of	1
MacIan,	1
who	1
was	1
at	1
bay	1
but	1
belabouring	1
his	1
two	1
enemies	1
handsomely.	1
The	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
liberated	1
reserve	1
was	1
to	1
them	1
like	1
that	1
of	1
Blucher	1
at	1
Waterloo;	1
the	1
two	1
set	1
off	1
at	1
a	1
sullen	1
trot	1
down	1
the	1
road,	1
leaving	1
even	1
the	1
walking-stick	1
lying	1
behind	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
moonlight.	1
MacIan	1
plucked	1
the	1
struggling	1
and	1
aspiring	1
idiot	1
off	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
the	1
car	1
like	1
a	1
stray	1
cat,	1
and	1
left	1
him	1
swaying	1
unsteadily	1
in	1
the	1
moon.	1
Then	1
he	1
approached	1
the	1
front	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
car	1
in	1
a	1
somewhat	1
embarrassed	1
manner	1
and	1
pulled	1
off	1
his	1
cap.	1
For	1
some	1
solid	1
seconds	1
the	1
lady	1
and	1
he	1
merely	1
looked	1
at	1
each	1
other,	1
and	1
MacIan	1
had	1
an	1
irrational	1
feeling	1
of	1
being	1
in	1
a	1
picture	1
hung	1
on	1
a	1
wall.	1
That	1
is,	1
he	1
was	1
motionless,	1
even	1
lifeless,	1
and	1
yet	1
staringly	1
significant,	1
like	1
a	1
picture.	1
The	1
white	1
moonlight	1
on	1
the	1
road,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
looking	1
at	1
it,	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
vision	1
of	1
the	1
road	1
being	1
white	1
with	1
snow.	1
The	1
motor-car,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
looking	1
at	1
it,	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
rude	1
impression	1
of	1
a	1
captured	1
coach	1
in	1
the	1
old	1
days	1
of	1
highwaymen.	1
And	1
he	1
whose	1
whole	1
soul	1
was	1
with	1
the	1
swords	1
and	1
stately	1
manners	1
of	1
the	1
eighteenth	1
century,	1
he	1
who	1
was	1
a	1
Jacobite	1
risen	1
from	1
the	1
dead,	1
had	1
an	1
overwhelming	1
sense	1
of	1
being	1
once	1
more	1
in	1
the	1
picture,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
so	1
long	1
been	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
picture.	1
In	1
that	1
short	1
and	1
strong	1
silence	1
he	1
absorbed	1
the	1
lady	1
from	1
head	1
to	1
foot.	1
He	1
had	1
never	1
really	1
looked	1
at	1
a	1
human	1
being	1
before	1
in	1
his	1
life.	1
He	1
saw	1
her	1
face	1
and	1
hair	1
first,	1
then	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
long	1
suede	1
gloves;	1
then	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
fur	1
cap	1
at	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
her	1
brown	1
hair.	1
He	1
might,	1
perhaps,	1
be	1
excused	1
for	1
this	1
hungry	1
attention.	1
He	1
had	1
prayed	1
that	1
some	1
sign	1
might	1
come	1
from	1
heaven;	1
and	1
after	1
an	1
almost	1
savage	1
scrutiny	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
conclusion	1
that	1
his	1
one	1
did.	1
The	1
lady's	1
instantaneous	1
arrest	1
of	1
speech	1
might	1
need	1
more	1
explaining;	1
but	1
she	1
may	1
well	1
have	1
been	1
stunned	1
with	1
the	1
squalid	1
attack	1
and	1
the	1
abrupt	1
rescue.	1
Yet	1
it	1
was	1
she	1
who	1
remembered	1
herself	1
first	1
and	1
suddenly	1
called	1
out	1
with	1
self-accusing	1
horror:	1
"Oh,	1
that	1
poor,	1
poor	1
man!"	1
They	1
both	1
swung	1
round	1
abruptly	1
and	1
saw	1
that	1
Turnbull,	1
with	1
his	1
recovered	1
sword	1
under	1
his	1
arm-pit,	1
was	1
already	1
lifting	1
the	1
fallen	1
chauffeur	1
into	1
the	1
car.	1
He	1
was	1
only	1
stunned	1
and	1
was	1
slowly	1
awakening,	1
feebly	1
waving	1
his	1
left	1
arm.	1
The	1
lady	1
in	1
long	1
gloves	1
and	1
the	1
fur	1
cap	1
leapt	1
out	1
and	1
ran	1
rapidly	1
towards	1
them,	1
only	1
to	1
be	1
reassured	1
by	1
Turnbull,	1
who	1
(unlike	1
many	1
of	1
his	1
school)	1
really	1
knew	1
a	1
little	1
science	1
when	1
he	1
invoked	1
it	1
to	1
redeem	1
the	1
world.	1
"He's	1
all	1
right,"	1
said	1
he;	1
"he's	1
quite	1
safe.	1
But	1
I'm	1
afraid	1
he	1
won't	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
drive	1
the	1
car	1
for	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
or	1
so."	1
"I	1
can	1
drive	1
the	1
car,"	1
said	1
the	1
young	1
woman	1
in	1
the	1
fur	1
cap	1
with	1
stony	1
practicability.	1
"Oh,	1
in	1
that	1
case,"	1
began	1
MacIan,	1
uneasily;	1
and	1
that	1
paralysing	1
shyness	1
which	1
is	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
romance	1
induced	1
him	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
backward	1
movement	1
as	1
if	1
leaving	1
her	1
to	1
herself.	1
But	1
Turnbull	1
was	1
more	1
rational	1
than	1
he,	1
being	1
more	1
indifferent.	1
"I	1
don't	1
think	1
you	1
ought	1
to	1
drive	1
home	1
alone,	1
ma'am,"	1
he	1
said,	1
gruffly.	1
"There	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
rowdy	1
parties	1
along	1
this	1
road,	1
and	1
the	1
man	1
will	1
be	1
no	1
use	1
for	1
an	1
hour.	1
If	1
you	1
will	1
tell	1
us	1
where	1
you	1
are	1
going,	1
we	1
will	1
see	1
you	1
safely	1
there	1
and	1
say	1
good	1
night."	1
The	1
young	1
lady	1
exhibited	1
all	1
the	1
abrupt	1
disturbance	1
of	1
a	1
person	1
who	1
is	1
not	1
commonly	1
disturbed.	1
She	1
said	1
almost	1
sharply	1
and	1
yet	1
with	1
evident	1
sincerity:	1
"Of	1
course	1
I	1
am	1
awfully	1
grateful	1
to	1
you	1
for	1
all	1
you've	1
done--and	1
there's	1
plenty	1
of	1
room	1
if	1
you'll	1
come	1
in."	1
Turnbull,	1
with	1
the	1
complete	1
innocence	1
of	1
an	1
absolutely	1
sound	1
motive,	1
immediately	1
jumped	1
into	1
the	1
car;	1
but	1
the	1
girl	1
cast	1
an	1
eye	1
at	1
MacIan,	1
who	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
road	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
as	1
if	1
rooted	1
like	1
a	1
tree.	1
Then	1
he	1
also	1
tumbled	1
his	1
long	1
legs	1
into	1
the	1
tonneau,	1
having	1
that	1
sense	1
of	1
degradedly	1
diving	1
into	1
heaven	1
which	1
so	1
many	1
have	1
known	1
in	1
so	1
many	1
human	1
houses	1
when	1
they	1
consented	1
to	1
stop	1
to	1
tea	1
or	1
were	1
allowed	1
to	1
stop	1
to	1
supper.	1
The	1
slowly	1
reviving	1
chauffeur	1
was	1
set	1
in	1
the	1
back	1
seat;	1
Turnbull	1
and	1
MacIan	1
had	1
fallen	1
into	1
the	1
middle	1
one;	1
the	1
lady	1
with	1
a	1
steely	1
coolness	1
had	1
taken	1
the	1
driver's	1
seat	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
handles	1
of	1
that	1
headlong	1
machine.	1
A	1
moment	1
afterwards	1
the	1
engine	1
started,	1
with	1
a	1
throb	1
and	1
leap	1
unfamiliar	1
to	1
Turnbull,	1
who	1
had	1
only	1
once	1
been	1
in	1
a	1
motor	1
during	1
a	1
general	1
election,	1
and	1
utterly	1
unknown	1
to	1
MacIan,	1
who	1
in	1
his	1
present	1
mood	1
thought	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
Almost	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
instant	1
that	1
the	1
car	1
plucked	1
itself	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mud	1
and	1
whipped	1
away	1
up	1
the	1
road,	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
flung	1
into	1
the	1
ditch	1
rose	1
waveringly	1
to	1
his	1
feet.	1
When	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
car	1
escaping	1
he	1
ran	1
after	1
it	1
and	1
shouted	1
something	1
which,	1
owing	1
to	1
the	1
increasing	1
distance,	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
heard.	1
It	1
is	1
awful	1
to	1
reflect	1
that,	1
if	1
his	1
remark	1
was	1
valuable,	1
it	1
is	1
quite	1
lost	1
to	1
the	1
world.	1
The	1
car	1
shot	1
on	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
shining	1
moonlit	1
lanes,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
sound	1
in	1
it	1
except	1
the	1
occasional	1
click	1
or	1
catch	1
of	1
its	1
machinery;	1
for	1
through	1
some	1
cause	1
or	1
other	1
no	1
soul	1
inside	1
it	1
could	1
think	1
of	1
a	1
word	1
to	1
say.	1
The	1
lady	1
symbolized	1
her	1
feelings,	1
whatever	1
they	1
were,	1
by	1
urging	1
the	1
machine	1
faster	1
and	1
faster	1
until	1
scattered	1
woodlands	1
went	1
by	1
them	1
in	1
one	1
black	1
blotch	1
and	1
heavy	1
hills	1
and	1
valleys	1
seemed	1
to	1
ripple	1
under	1
the	1
wheels	1
like	1
mere	1
waves.	1
A	1
little	1
while	1
afterwards	1
this	1
mood	1
seemed	1
to	1
slacken	1
and	1
she	1
fell	1
into	1
a	1
more	1
ordinary	1
pace;	1
but	1
still	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
speak.	1
Turnbull,	1
who	1
kept	1
a	1
more	1
common	1
and	1
sensible	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
case	1
than	1
anyone	1
else,	1
made	1
some	1
remark	1
about	1
the	1
moonlight;	1
but	1
something	1
indescribable	1
made	1
him	1
also	1
relapse	1
into	1
silence.	1
All	1
this	1
time	1
MacIan	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
monstrous	1
delirium,	1
like	1
some	1
fabulous	1
hero	1
snatched	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
moon.	1
The	1
difference	1
between	1
this	1
experience	1
and	1
common	1
experiences	1
was	1
analogous	1
to	1
that	1
between	1
waking	1
life	1
and	1
a	1
dream.	1
Yet	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
feel	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
dreaming;	1
rather	1
the	1
other	1
way;	1
as	1
waking	1
was	1
more	1
actual	1
than	1
dreaming,	1
so	1
this	1
seemed	1
by	1
another	1
degree	1
more	1
actual	1
than	1
waking	1
itself.	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
another	1
life	1
altogether,	1
like	1
a	1
cosmos	1
with	1
a	1
new	1
dimension.	1
He	1
felt	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
hurled	1
into	1
some	1
new	1
incarnation:	1
into	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
new	1
relations,	1
wrongs	1
and	1
rights,	1
with	1
towering	1
responsibilities	1
and	1
almost	1
tragic	1
joys	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
as	1
yet	1
had	1
no	1
time	1
to	1
examine.	1
Heaven	1
had	1
not	1
merely	1
sent	1
him	1
a	1
message;	1
Heaven	1
itself	1
had	1
opened	1
around	1
him	1
and	1
given	1
him	1
an	1
hour	1
of	1
its	1
own	1
ancient	1
and	1
star-shattering	1
energy.	1
He	1
had	1
never	1
felt	1
so	1
much	1
alive	1
before;	1
and	1
yet	1
he	1
was	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
a	1
trance.	1
And	1
if	1
you	1
had	1
asked	1
him	1
on	1
what	1
his	1
throbbing	1
happiness	1
hung,	1
he	1
could	1
only	1
have	1
told	1
you	1
that	1
it	1
hung	1
on	1
four	1
or	1
five	1
visible	1
facts,	1
as	1
a	1
curtain	1
hangs	1
on	1
four	1
of	1
five	1
fixed	1
nails.	1
The	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
lady	1
had	1
a	1
little	1
fur	1
at	1
her	1
throat;	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
curve	1
of	1
her	1
cheek	1
was	1
a	1
low	1
and	1
lean	1
curve	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
moonlight	1
caught	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
her	1
cheek-bone;	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
her	1
hands	1
were	1
small	1
but	1
heavily	1
gloved	1
as	1
they	1
gripped	1
the	1
steering-wheel;	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
a	1
white	1
witch	1
light	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
road;	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
brisk	1
breeze	1
of	1
their	1
passage	1
stirred	1
and	1
fluttered	1
a	1
little	1
not	1
only	1
the	1
brown	1
hair	1
of	1
her	1
head	1
but	1
the	1
black	1
fur	1
on	1
her	1
cap.	1
All	1
these	1
facts	1
were	1
to	1
him	1
certain	1
and	1
incredible,	1
like	1
sacraments.	1
When	1
they	1
had	1
driven	1
half	1
a	1
mile	1
farther,	1
a	1
big	1
shadow	1
was	1
flung	1
across	1
the	1
path,	1
followed	1
by	1
its	1
bulky	1
owner,	1
who	1
eyed	1
the	1
car	1
critically	1
but	1
let	1
it	1
pass.	1
The	1
silver	1
moonlight	1
picked	1
out	1
a	1
piece	1
or	1
two	1
of	1
pewter	1
ornament	1
on	1
his	1
blue	1
uniform;	1
and	1
as	1
they	1
went	1
by	1
they	1
knew	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
sergeant	1
of	1
police.	1
Three	1
hundred	1
yards	1
farther	1
on	1
another	1
policeman	1
stepped	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
road	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
stop	1
them,	1
then	1
seemed	1
to	1
doubt	1
his	1
own	1
authority	1
and	1
stepped	1
back	1
again.	1
The	1
girl	1
was	1
a	1
daughter	1
of	1
the	1
rich;	1
and	1
this	1
police	1
suspicion	1
(under	1
which	1
all	1
the	1
poor	1
live	1
day	1
and	1
night)	1
stung	1
her	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
into	1
speech.	1
"What	1
can	1
they	1
mean?"	1
she	1
cried	1
out	1
in	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
temper;	1
"this	1
car's	1
going	1
like	1
a	1
snail."	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
short	1
silence,	1
and	1
then	1
Turnbull	1
said:	1
"It	1
is	1
certainly	1
very	1
odd,	1
you	1
are	1
driving	1
quietly	1
enough."	1
"You	1
are	1
driving	1
nobly,"	1
said	1
MacIan,	1
and	1
his	1
words	1
(which	1
had	1
no	1
meaning	1
whatever)	1
sounded	1
hoarse	1
and	1
ungainly	1
even	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
ears.	1
They	1
passed	1
the	1
next	1
mile	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
swiftly	1
and	1
smoothly;	1
yet	1
among	1
the	1
many	1
things	1
which	1
they	1
passed	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
clump	1
of	1
eager	1
policemen	1
standing	1
at	1
a	1
cross-road.	1
As	1
they	1
passed,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
policemen	1
shouted	1
something	1
to	1
the	1
others;	1
but	1
nothing	1
else	1
happened.	1
Eight	1
hundred	1
yards	1
farther	1
on,	1
Turnbull	1
stood	1
up	1
suddenly	1
in	1
the	1
swaying	1
car.	1
"My	1
God,	1
MacIan!"	1
he	1
called	1
out,	1
showing	1
his	1
first	1
emotion	1
of	1
that	1
night.	1
"I	1
don't	1
believe	1
it's	1
the	1
pace;	1
it	1
couldn't	1
be	1
the	1
pace.	1
I	1
believe	1
it's	1
us."	1
MacIan	1
sat	1
motionless	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
moments	1
and	1
then	1
turned	1
up	1
at	1
his	1
companion	1
a	1
face	1
that	1
was	1
as	1
white	1
as	1
the	1
moon	1
above	1
it.	1
"You	1
may	1
be	1
right,"	1
he	1
said	1
at	1
last;	1
"if	1
you	1
are,	1
I	1
must	1
tell	1
her."	1
"I	1
will	1
tell	1
the	1
lady	1
if	1
you	1
like,"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
with	1
his	1
unconquered	1
good	1
temper.	1
"You!"	1
said	1
MacIan,	1
with	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
sincere	1
and	1
instinctive	1
astonishment.	1
"Why	1
should	1
you--no,	1
I	1
must	1
tell	1
her,	1
of	1
course----"	1
And	1
he	1
leant	1
forward	1
and	1
spoke	1
to	1
the	1
lady	1
in	1
the	1
fur	1
cap.	1
"I	1
am	1
afraid,	1
madam,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
have	1
got	1
you	1
into	1
some	1
trouble,"	1
he	1
said,	1
and	1
even	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
it	1
it	1
sounded	1
wrong,	1
like	1
everything	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
this	1
particular	1
person	1
in	1
the	1
long	1
gloves.	1
"The	1
fact	1
is,"	1
he	1
resumed,	1
desperately,	1
"the	1
fact	1
is,	1
we	1
are	1
being	1
chased	1
by	1
the	1
police."	1
Then	1
the	1
last	1
flattening	1
hammer	1
fell	1
upon	1
poor	1
Evan's	1
embarrassment;	1
for	1
the	1
fluffy	1
brown	1
head	1
with	1
the	1
furry	1
black	1
cap	1
did	1
not	1
turn	1
by	1
a	1
section	1
of	1
the	1
compass.	1
"We	1
are	1
chased	1
by	1
the	1
police,"	1
repeated	1
MacIan,	1
vigorously;	1
then	1
he	1
added,	1
as	1
if	1
beginning	1
an	1
explanation,	1
"You	1
see,	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
Catholic."	1
The	1
wind	1
whipped	1
back	1
a	1
curl	1
of	1
the	1
brown	1
hair	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
necessitate	1
a	1
new	1
theory	1
of	1
aesthetics	1
touching	1
the	1
line	1
of	1
the	1
cheek-bone;	1
but	1
the	1
head	1
did	1
not	1
turn.	1
"You	1
see,"	1
began	1
MacIan,	1
again	1
blunderingly,	1
"this	1
gentleman	1
wrote	1
in	1
his	1
newspaper	1
that	1
Our	1
Lady	1
was	1
a	1
common	1
woman,	1
a	1
bad	1
woman,	1
and	1
so	1
we	1
agreed	1
to	1
fight;	1
and	1
we	1
were	1
fighting	1
quite	1
a	1
little	1
time	1
ago--but	1
that	1
was	1
before	1
we	1
saw	1
you."	1
The	1
young	1
lady	1
driving	1
her	1
car	1
had	1
half	1
turned	1
her	1
face	1
to	1
listen;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
reverent	1
or	1
a	1
patient	1
face	1
that	1
she	1
showed	1
him.	1
Her	1
Norman	1
nose	1
was	1
tilted	1
a	1
trifle	1
too	1
high	1
upon	1
the	1
slim	1
stalk	1
of	1
her	1
neck	1
and	1
body.	1
When	1
MacIan	1
saw	1
that	1
arrogant	1
and	1
uplifted	1
profile	1
pencilled	1
plainly	1
against	1
the	1
moonshine,	1
he	1
accepted	1
an	1
ultimate	1
defeat.	1
He	1
had	1
expected	1
the	1
angels	1
to	1
despise	1
him	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
wrong,	1
but	1
not	1
to	1
despise	1
him	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
this.	1
"You	1
see,"	1
said	1
the	1
stumbling	1
spokesman,	1
"I	1
was	1
angry	1
with	1
him	1
when	1
he	1
insulted	1
the	1
Mother	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
I	1
asked	1
him	1
to	1
fight	1
a	1
duel	1
with	1
me;	1
but	1
the	1
police	1
are	1
all	1
trying	1
to	1
stop	1
it."	1
Nothing	1
seemed	1
to	1
waver	1
or	1
flicker	1
in	1
the	1
fair	1
young	1
falcon	1
profile;	1
and	1
it	1
only	1
opened	1
its	1
lips	1
to	1
say,	1
after	1
a	1
silence:	1
"I	1
thought	1
people	1
in	1
our	1
time	1
were	1
supposed	1
to	1
respect	1
each	1
other's	1
religion."	1
Under	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
that	1
arrogant	1
face	1
MacIan	1
could	1
only	1
fall	1
back	1
on	1
the	1
obvious	1
answer:	1
"But	1
what	1
about	1
a	1
man's	1
irreligion?"	1
The	1
face	1
only	1
answered:	1
"Well,	1
you	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
more	1
broadminded."	1
If	1
anyone	1
else	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
had	1
said	1
the	1
words,	1
MacIan	1
would	1
have	1
snorted	1
with	1
his	1
equine	1
neigh	1
of	1
scorn.	1
But	1
in	1
this	1
case	1
he	1
seemed	1
knocked	1
down	1
by	1
a	1
superior	1
simplicity,	1
as	1
if	1
his	1
eccentric	1
attitude	1
were	1
rebuked	1
by	1
the	1
innocence	1
of	1
a	1
child.	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
dissociate	1
anything	1
that	1
this	1
woman	1
said	1
or	1
did	1
or	1
wore	1
from	1
an	1
idea	1
of	1
spiritual	1
rarity	1
and	1
virtue.	1
Like	1
most	1
others	1
under	1
the	1
same	1
elemental	1
passion,	1
his	1
soul	1
was	1
at	1
present	1
soaked	1
in	1
ethics.	1
He	1
could	1
have	1
applied	1
moral	1
terms	1
to	1
the	1
material	1
objects	1
of	1
her	1
environment.	1
If	1
someone	1
had	1
spoken	1
of	1
"her	1
generous	1
ribbon"	1
or	1
"her	1
chivalrous	1
gloves"	1
or	1
"her	1
merciful	1
shoe-buckle,"	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
nonsense.	1
He	1
was	1
silent,	1
and	1
the	1
girl	1
went	1
on	1
in	1
a	1
lower	1
key	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
were	1
momentarily	1
softened	1
and	1
a	1
little	1
saddened	1
also.	1
"It	1
won't	1
do,	1
you	1
know,"	1
she	1
said;	1
"you	1
can't	1
find	1
out	1
the	1
truth	1
in	1
that	1
way.	1
There	1
are	1
such	1
heaps	1
of	1
churches	1
and	1
people	1
thinking	1
different	1
things	1
nowadays,	1
and	1
they	1
all	1
think	1
they	1
are	1
right.	1
My	1
uncle	1
was	1
a	1
Swedenborgian."	1
MacIan	1
sat	1
with	1
bowed	1
head,	1
listening	1
hungrily	1
to	1
her	1
voice	1
but	1
hardly	1
to	1
her	1
words,	1
and	1
seeing	1
his	1
great	1
world	1
drama	1
grow	1
smaller	1
and	1
smaller	1
before	1
his	1
eyes	1
till	1
it	1
was	1
no	1
bigger	1
than	1
a	1
child's	1
toy	1
theatre.	1
"The	1
time's	1
gone	1
by	1
for	1
all	1
that,"	1
she	1
went	1
on;	1
"you	1
can't	1
find	1
out	1
the	1
real	1
thing	1
like	1
that--if	1
there	1
is	1
really	1
anything	1
to	1
find----"	1
and	1
she	1
sighed	1
rather	1
drearily;	1
for,	1
like	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
women	1
of	1
our	1
wealthy	1
class,	1
she	1
was	1
old	1
and	1
broken	1
in	1
thought,	1
though	1
young	1
and	1
clean	1
enough	1
in	1
her	1
emotions.	1
"Our	1
object,"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
shortly,	1
"is	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
effective	1
demonstration";	1
and	1
after	1
that	1
word,	1
MacIan	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
vision	1
again	1
and	1
found	1
it	1
smaller	1
than	1
ever.	1
"It	1
would	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
newspapers,	1
of	1
course,"	1
said	1
the	1
girl.	1
"People	1
read	1
the	1
newspapers,	1
but	1
they	1
don't	1
believe	1
them,	1
or	1
anything	1
else,	1
I	1
think."	1
And	1
she	1
sighed	1
again.	1
She	1
drove	1
in	1
silence	1
a	1
third	1
of	1
a	1
mile	1
before	1
she	1
added,	1
as	1
if	1
completing	1
the	1
sentence:	1
"Anyhow,	1
the	1
whole	1
thing's	1
quite	1
absurd."	1
"I	1
don't	1
think,"	1
began	1
Turnbull,	1
"that	1
you	1
quite	1
realize----	1
Hullo!	1
hullo--hullo--what's	1
this?"	1
The	1
amateur	1
chauffeur	1
had	1
been	1
forced	1
to	1
bring	1
the	1
car	1
to	1
a	1
staggering	1
stoppage,	1
for	1
a	1
file	1
of	1
fat,	1
blue	1
policemen	1
made	1
a	1
wall	1
across	1
the	1
way.	1
A	1
sergeant	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
side	1
and	1
touched	1
his	1
peaked	1
cap	1
to	1
the	1
lady.	1
"Beg	1
your	1
pardon,	1
miss,"	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
some	1
embarrassment,	1
for	1
he	1
knew	1
her	1
for	1
a	1
daughter	1
of	1
a	1
dominant	1
house,	1
"but	1
we	1
have	1
reason	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
in	1
your	1
car	1
are----"	1
and	1
he	1
hesitated	1
for	1
a	1
polite	1
phrase.	1
"I	1
am	1
Evan	1
MacIan,"	1
said	1
that	1
gentleman,	1
and	1
stood	1
up	1
in	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
gloomy	1
pomp,	1
not	1
wholly	1
without	1
a	1
touch	1
of	1
the	1
sulks	1
of	1
a	1
schoolboy.	1
"Yes,	1
we	1
will	1
get	1
out,	1
sergeant,"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
more	1
easily;	1
"my	1
name	1
is	1
James	1
Turnbull.	1
We	1
must	1
not	1
incommode	1
the	1
lady."	1
"What	1
are	1
you	1
taking	1
them	1
up	1
for?"	1
asked	1
the	1
young	1
woman,	1
looking	1
straight	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
her	1
along	1
the	1
road.	1
"It's	1
under	1
the	1
new	1
act,"	1
said	1
the	1
sergeant,	1
almost	1
apologetically.	1
"Incurable	1
disturbers	1
of	1
the	1
peace."	1
"What	1
will	1
happen	1
to	1
them?"	1
she	1
asked,	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
frigid	1
clearness.	1
"Westgate	1
Adult	1
Reformatory,"	1
he	1
replied,	1
briefly.	1
"Until	1
when?"	1
"Until	1
they	1
are	1
cured,"	1
said	1
the	1
official.	1
"Very	1
well,	1
sergeant,"	1
said	1
the	1
young	1
lady,	1
with	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
tired	1
common	1
sense.	1
"I	1
am	1
sure	1
I	1
don't	1
want	1
to	1
protect	1
criminals	1
or	1
go	1
against	1
the	1
law;	1
but	1
I	1
must	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
these	1
gentlemen	1
have	1
done	1
me	1
a	1
considerable	1
service;	1
you	1
won't	1
mind	1
drawing	1
your	1
men	1
a	1
little	1
farther	1
off	1
while	1
I	1
say	1
good	1
night	1
to	1
them.	1
Men	1
like	1
that	1
always	1
misunderstand."	1
The	1
sergeant	1
was	1
profoundly	1
disquieted	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
at	1
the	1
mere	1
idea	1
of	1
arresting	1
anyone	1
in	1
the	1
company	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
lady;	1
to	1
refuse	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
minor	1
requests	1
was	1
quite	1
beyond	1
his	1
courage.	1
The	1
police	1
fell	1
back	1
to	1
a	1
few	1
yards	1
behind	1
the	1
car.	1
Turnbull	1
took	1
up	1
the	1
two	1
swords	1
that	1
were	1
their	1
only	1
luggage;	1
the	1
swords	1
that,	1
after	1
so	1
many	1
half	1
duels,	1
they	1
were	1
now	1
to	1
surrender	1
at	1
last.	1
MacIan,	1
the	1
blood	1
thundering	1
in	1
his	1
brain	1
at	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
that	1
instant	1
of	1
farewell,	1
bent	1
over,	1
fumbled	1
at	1
the	1
handle	1
and	1
flung	1
open	1
the	1
door	1
to	1
get	1
out.	1
But	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
get	1
out.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
get	1
out,	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
dangerous	1
to	1
jump	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
car	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
going	1
at	1
full	1
speed.	1
And	1
the	1
car	1
was	1
going	1
at	1
full	1
speed,	1
because	1
the	1
young	1
lady,	1
without	1
turning	1
her	1
head	1
or	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
saying	1
a	1
syllable,	1
had	1
driven	1
down	1
a	1
handle	1
that	1
made	1
the	1
machine	1
plunge	1
forward	1
like	1
a	1
buffalo	1
and	1
then	1
fly	1
over	1
the	1
landscape	1
like	1
a	1
greyhound.	1
The	1
police	1
made	1
one	1
rush	1
to	1
follow,	1
and	1
then	1
dropped	1
so	1
grotesque	1
and	1
hopeless	1
a	1
chase.	1
Away	1
in	1
the	1
vanishing	1
distance	1
they	1
could	1
see	1
the	1
sergeant	1
furiously	1
making	1
notes.	1
The	1
open	1
door,	1
still	1
left	1
loose	1
on	1
its	1
hinges,	1
swung	1
and	1
banged	1
quite	1
crazily	1
as	1
they	1
went	1
whizzing	1
up	1
one	1
road	1
and	1
down	1
another.	1
Nor	1
did	1
MacIan	1
sit	1
down;	1
he	1
stood	1
up	1
stunned	1
and	1
yet	1
staring,	1
as	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
stood	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
trumpet	1
of	1
the	1
Last	1
Day.	1
A	1
black	1
dot	1
in	1
the	1
distance	1
sprang	1
up	1
a	1
tall	1
black	1
forest,	1
swallowed	1
them	1
and	1
spat	1
them	1
out	1
again	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
end.	1
A	1
railway	1
bridge	1
grew	1
larger	1
and	1
larger	1
till	1
it	1
leapt	1
upon	1
their	1
backs	1
bellowing,	1
and	1
was	1
in	1
its	1
turn	1
left	1
behind.	1
Avenues	1
of	1
poplars	1
on	1
both	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
road	1
chased	1
each	1
other	1
like	1
the	1
figures	1
in	1
a	1
zoetrope.	1
Now	1
and	1
then	1
with	1
a	1
shock	1
and	1
rattle	1
they	1
went	1
through	1
sleeping	1
moonlit	1
villages,	1
which	1
must	1
have	1
stirred	1
an	1
instant	1
in	1
their	1
sleep	1
as	1
at	1
the	1
passing	1
of	1
a	1
fugitive	1
earthquake.	1
Sometimes	1
in	1
an	1
outlying	1
house	1
a	1
light	1
in	1
one	1
erratic,	1
unexpected	1
window	1
would	1
give	1
them	1
a	1
nameless	1
hint	1
of	1
the	1
hundred	1
human	1
secrets	1
which	1
they	1
left	1
behind	1
them	1
with	1
their	1
dust.	1
Sometimes	1
even	1
a	1
slouching	1
rustic	1
would	1
be	1
afoot	1
on	1
the	1
road	1
and	1
would	1
look	1
after	1
them,	1
as	1
after	1
a	1
flying	1
phantom.	1
But	1
still	1
MacIan	1
stood	1
up	1
staring	1
at	1
earth	1
and	1
heaven;	1
and	1
still	1
the	1
door	1
he	1
had	1
flung	1
open	1
flapped	1
loose	1
like	1
a	1
flag.	1
Turnbull,	1
after	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
of	1
dumb	1
amazement,	1
had	1
yielded	1
to	1
the	1
healthiest	1
element	1
in	1
his	1
nature	1
and	1
gone	1
off	1
into	1
uncontrollable	1
fits	1
of	1
laughter.	1
The	1
girl	1
had	1
not	1
stirred	1
an	1
inch.	1
After	1
another	1
half	1
mile	1
that	1
seemed	1
a	1
mere	1
flash,	1
Turnbull	1
leant	1
over	1
and	1
locked	1
the	1
door.	1
Evan	1
staggered	1
at	1
last	1
into	1
his	1
seat	1
and	1
hid	1
his	1
throbbing	1
head	1
in	1
his	1
hands;	1
and	1
still	1
the	1
car	1
flew	1
on	1
and	1
its	1
driver	1
sat	1
inflexible	1
and	1
silent.	1
The	1
moon	1
had	1
already	1
gone	1
down,	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
darkness	1
was	1
faintly	1
troubled	1
with	1
twilight	1
and	1
the	1
first	1
movement	1
of	1
beasts	1
and	1
fowls.	1
It	1
was	1
that	1
mysterious	1
moment	1
when	1
light	1
is	1
coming	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
something	1
unknown	1
whose	1
nature	1
one	1
could	1
not	1
guess--a	1
mere	1
alteration	1
in	1
everything.	1
They	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
sky	1
and	1
it	1
seemed	1
as	1
dark	1
as	1
ever;	1
then	1
they	1
saw	1
the	1
black	1
shape	1
of	1
a	1
tower	1
or	1
tree	1
against	1
it	1
and	1
knew	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
already	1
grey.	1
Save	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
driving	1
southward	1
and	1
had	1
certainly	1
passed	1
the	1
longitude	1
of	1
London,	1
they	1
knew	1
nothing	1
of	1
their	1
direction;	1
but	1
Turnbull,	1
who	1
had	1
spent	1
a	1
year	1
on	1
the	1
Hampshire	1
coast	1
in	1
his	1
youth,	1
began	1
to	1
recognize	1
the	1
unmistakable	1
but	1
quite	1
indescribable	1
villages	1
of	1
the	1
English	1
south.	1
Then	1
a	1
white	1
witch	1
fire	1
began	1
to	1
burn	1
between	1
the	1
black	1
stems	1
of	1
the	1
fir-trees;	1
and,	1
like	1
so	1
many	1
things	1
in	1
nature,	1
though	1
not	1
in	1
books	1
on	1
evolution,	1
the	1
daybreak,	1
when	1
it	1
did	1
come,	1
came	1
much	1
quicker	1
than	1
one	1
would	1
think.	1
The	1
gloomy	1
heavens	1
were	1
ripped	1
up	1
and	1
rolled	1
away	1
like	1
a	1
scroll,	1
revealing	1
splendours,	1
as	1
the	1
car	1
went	1
roaring	1
up	1
the	1
curve	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
hill;	1
and	1
above	1
them	1
and	1
black	1
against	1
the	1
broadening	1
light,	1
there	1
stood	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
crouching	1
and	1
fantastic	1
trees	1
that	1
are	1
first	1
signals	1
of	1
the	1
sea.	1
X.	1
THE	1
SWORDS	1
REJOINED	1
As	1
they	1
came	1
over	1
the	1
hill	1
and	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
it,	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
too	1
much	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
the	1
whole	1
universe	1
of	1
God	1
opened	1
over	1
them	1
and	1
under	1
them,	1
like	1
a	1
thing	1
unfolding	1
to	1
five	1
times	1
its	1
size.	1
Almost	1
under	1
their	1
feet	1
opened	1
the	1
enormous	1
sea,	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
a	1
steep	1
valley	1
which	1
fell	1
down	1
into	1
a	1
bay;	1
and	1
the	1
sea	1
under	1
their	1
feet	1
blazed	1
at	1
them	1
almost	1
as	1
lustrous	1
and	1
almost	1
as	1
empty	1
as	1
the	1
sky.	1
The	1
sunrise	1
opened	1
above	1
them	1
like	1
some	1
cosmic	1
explosion,	1
shining	1
and	1
shattering	1
and	1
yet	1
silent;	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
world	1
were	1
blown	1
to	1
pieces	1
without	1
a	1
sound.	1
Round	1
the	1
rays	1
of	1
the	1
victorious	1
sun	1
swept	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
rainbow	1
of	1
confused	1
and	1
conquered	1
colours--brown	1
and	1
blue	1
and	1
green	1
and	1
flaming	1
rose-colour;	1
as	1
though	1
gold	1
were	1
driving	1
before	1
it	1
all	1
the	1
colours	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
The	1
lines	1
of	1
the	1
landscape	1
down	1
which	1
they	1
sped,	1
were	1
the	1
simple,	1
strict,	1
yet	1
swerving,	1
lines	1
of	1
a	1
rushing	1
river;	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
almost	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
being	1
sucked	1
down	1
in	1
a	1
huge	1
still	1
whirlpool.	1
Turnbull	1
had	1
some	1
such	1
feeling,	1
for	1
he	1
spoke	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
for	1
many	1
hours.	1
"If	1
we	1
go	1
down	1
at	1
this	1
rate	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
over	1
the	1
sea	1
cliff,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"How	1
glorious!"	1
said	1
MacIan.	1
When,	1
however,	1
they	1
had	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
wide	1
hollow	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
that	1
landslide,	1
the	1
car	1
took	1
a	1
calm	1
and	1
graceful	1
curve	1
along	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
melted	1
into	1
the	1
fringe	1
of	1
a	1
few	1
trees,	1
and	1
quietly,	1
yet	1
astonishingly,	1
stopped.	1
A	1
belated	1
light	1
was	1
burning	1
in	1
the	1
broad	1
morning	1
in	1
the	1
window	1
of	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
lodge-	1
or	1
gate-keepers'	1
cottage;	1
and	1
the	1
girl	1
stood	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
car	1
and	1
turned	1
her	1
splendid	1
face	1
to	1
the	1
sun.	1
Evan	1
seemed	1
startled	1
by	1
the	1
stillness,	1
like	1
one	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
born	1
amid	1
sound	1
and	1
speed.	1
He	1
wavered	1
on	1
his	1
long	1
legs	1
as	1
he	1
stood	1
up;	1
he	1
pulled	1
himself	1
together,	1
and	1
the	1
only	1
consequence	1
was	1
that	1
he	1
trembled	1
from	1
head	1
to	1
foot.	1
Turnbull	1
had	1
already	1
opened	1
the	1
door	1
on	1
his	1
side	1
and	1
jumped	1
out.	1
The	1
moment	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
so	1
the	1
strange	1
young	1
woman	1
had	1
one	1
more	1
mad	1
movement,	1
and	1
deliberately	1
drove	1
the	1
car	1
a	1
few	1
yards	1
farther.	1
Then	1
she	1
got	1
out	1
with	1
an	1
almost	1
cruel	1
coolness	1
and	1
began	1
pulling	1
off	1
her	1
long	1
gloves	1
and	1
almost	1
whistling.	1
"You	1
can	1
leave	1
me	1
here,"	1
she	1
said,	1
quite	1
casually,	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
met	1
five	1
minutes	1
before.	1
"That	1
is	1
the	1
lodge	1
of	1
my	1
father's	1
place.	1
Please	1
come	1
in,	1
if	1
you	1
like--but	1
I	1
understood	1
that	1
you	1
had	1
some	1
business."	1
Evan	1
looked	1
at	1
that	1
lifted	1
face	1
and	1
found	1
it	1
merely	1
lovely;	1
he	1
was	1
far	1
too	1
much	1
of	1
a	1
fool	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
working	1
with	1
a	1
final	1
fatigue	1
and	1
that	1
its	1
austerity	1
was	1
agony.	1
He	1
was	1
even	1
fool	1
enough	1
to	1
ask	1
it	1
a	1
question.	1
"Why	1
did	1
you	1
save	1
us?"	1
he	1
said,	1
quite	1
humbly.	1
The	1
girl	1
tore	1
off	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
gloves,	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
were	1
tearing	1
off	1
her	1
hand.	1
"Oh,	1
I	1
don't	1
know,"	1
she	1
said,	1
bitterly.	1
"Now	1
I	1
come	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
it,	1
I	1
can't	1
imagine."	1
Evan's	1
thoughts,	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
piled	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
morning	1
star,	1
abruptly	1
let	1
him	1
down	1
with	1
a	1
crash	1
into	1
the	1
very	1
cellars	1
of	1
the	1
emotional	1
universe.	1
He	1
remained	1
in	1
a	1
stunned	1
silence	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time;	1
and	1
that,	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
only	1
known,	1
was	1
the	1
wisest	1
thing	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
possibly	1
do	1
at	1
the	1
moment.	1
Indeed,	1
the	1
silence	1
and	1
the	1
sunrise	1
had	1
their	1
healing	1
effect,	1
for	1
when	1
the	1
extraordinary	1
lady	1
spoke	1
again,	1
her	1
tone	1
was	1
more	1
friendly	1
and	1
apologetic.	1
"I'm	1
not	1
really	1
ungrateful,"	1
she	1
said;	1
"it	1
was	1
very	1
good	1
of	1
you	1
to	1
save	1
me	1
from	1
those	1
men."	1
"But	1
why?"	1
repeated	1
the	1
obstinate	1
and	1
dazed	1
MacIan,	1
"why	1
did	1
you	1
save	1
us	1
from	1
the	1
other	1
men?	1
I	1
mean	1
the	1
policemen?"	1
The	1
girl's	1
great	1
brown	1
eyes	1
were	1
lit	1
up	1
with	1
a	1
flash	1
that	1
was	1
at	1
once	1
final	1
desperation	1
and	1
the	1
loosening	1
of	1
some	1
private	1
and	1
passionate	1
reserve.	1
"Oh,	1
God	1
knows!"	1
she	1
cried.	1
"God	1
knows	1
that	1
if	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
God	1
He	1
has	1
turned	1
His	1
big	1
back	1
on	1
everything.	1
God	1
knows	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
no	1
pleasure	1
in	1
my	1
life,	1
though	1
I	1
am	1
pretty	1
and	1
young	1
and	1
father	1
has	1
plenty	1
of	1
money.	1
And	1
then	1
people	1
come	1
and	1
tell	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
do	1
things	1
and	1
I	1
do	1
them	1
and	1
it's	1
all	1
drivel.	1
They	1
want	1
you	1
to	1
do	1
work	1
among	1
the	1
poor;	1
which	1
means	1
reading	1
Ruskin	1
and	1
feeling	1
self-righteous	1
in	1
the	1
best	1
room	1
in	1
a	1
poor	1
tenement.	1
Or	1
to	1
help	1
some	1
cause	1
or	1
other,	1
which	1
always	1
means	1
bundling	1
people	1
out	1
of	1
crooked	1
houses,	1
in	1
which	1
they've	1
always	1
lived,	1
into	1
straight	1
houses,	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
often	1
die.	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
you	1
have	1
inside	1
only	1
the	1
horrid	1
irony	1
of	1
your	1
own	1
empty	1
head	1
and	1
empty	1
heart.	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
give	1
to	1
the	1
unfortunate,	1
when	1
my	1
whole	1
misfortune	1
is	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
give.	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
teach,	1
when	1
I	1
believe	1
nothing	1
at	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
taught.	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
save	1
the	1
children	1
from	1
death,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
even	1
certain	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
better	1
dead.	1
I	1
suppose	1
if	1
I	1
actually	1
saw	1
a	1
child	1
drowning	1
I	1
should	1
save	1
it.	1
But	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
from	1
the	1
same	1
motive	1
from	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
saved	1
you,	1
or	1
destroyed	1
you,	1
whichever	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
done."	1
"What	1
was	1
the	1
motive?"	1
asked	1
Evan,	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice.	1
"My	1
motive	1
is	1
too	1
big	1
for	1
my	1
mind,"	1
answered	1
the	1
girl.	1
Then,	1
after	1
a	1
pause,	1
as	1
she	1
stared	1
with	1
a	1
rising	1
colour	1
at	1
the	1
glittering	1
sea,	1
she	1
said:	1
"It	1
can't	1
be	1
described,	1
and	1
yet	1
I	1
am	1
trying	1
to	1
describe	1
it.	1
It	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
not	1
only	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
unhappy,	1
but	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
way	1
of	1
being	1
happy.	1
Father	1
is	1
not	1
happy,	1
though	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
Member	1
of	1
Parliament----"	1
She	1
paused	1
a	1
moment	1
and	1
added	1
with	1
a	1
ghost	1
of	1
a	1
smile:	1
"Nor	1
Aunt	1
Mabel,	1
though	1
a	1
man	1
from	1
India	1
has	1
told	1
her	1
the	1
secret	1
of	1
all	1
creeds.	1
But	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
wrong;	1
there	1
may	1
be	1
a	1
way	1
out.	1
And	1
for	1
one	1
stark,	1
insane	1
second,	1
I	1
felt	1
that,	1
after	1
all,	1
you	1
had	1
got	1
the	1
way	1
out	1
and	1
that	1
was	1
why	1
the	1
world	1
hated	1
you.	1
You	1
see,	1
if	1
there	1
were	1
a	1
way	1
out,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
sure	1
to	1
be	1
something	1
that	1
looked	1
very	1
queer."	1
Evan	1
put	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
his	1
forehead	1
and	1
began	1
stumblingly:	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
suppose	1
we	1
do	1
seem----"	1
"Oh,	1
yes,	1
you	1
look	1
queer	1
enough,"	1
she	1
said,	1
with	1
ringing	1
sincerity.	1
"You'll	1
be	1
all	1
the	1
better	1
for	1
a	1
wash	1
and	1
brush	1
up."	1
"You	1
forget	1
our	1
business,	1
madam,"	1
said	1
Evan,	1
in	1
a	1
shaking	1
voice;	1
"we	1
have	1
no	1
concern	1
but	1
to	1
kill	1
each	1
other."	1
"Well,	1
I	1
shouldn't	1
be	1
killed	1
looking	1
like	1
that	1
if	1
I	1
were	1
you,"	1
she	1
replied,	1
with	1
inhuman	1
honesty.	1
Evan	1
stood	1
and	1
rolled	1
his	1
eyes	1
in	1
masculine	1
bewilderment.	1
Then	1
came	1
the	1
final	1
change	1
in	1
this	1
Proteus,	1
and	1
she	1
put	1
out	1
both	1
her	1
hands	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
and	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
tone	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
lived	1
for	1
days	1
and	1
nights:	1
"Don't	1
you	1
understand	1
that	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
dare	1
to	1
stop	1
you?	1
What	1
you	1
are	1
doing	1
is	1
so	1
mad	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
quite	1
true.	1
Somehow	1
one	1
can	1
never	1
really	1
manage	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
atheist."	1
Turnbull	1
stood	1
staring	1
at	1
the	1
sea;	1
but	1
his	1
shoulders	1
showed	1
that	1
he	1
heard,	1
and	1
after	1
one	1
minute	1
he	1
turned	1
his	1
head.	1
But	1
the	1
girl	1
had	1
only	1
brushed	1
Evan's	1
hand	1
with	1
hers	1
and	1
had	1
fled	1
up	1
the	1
dark	1
alley	1
by	1
the	1
lodge	1
gate.	1
Evan	1
stood	1
rooted	1
upon	1
the	1
road,	1
literally	1
like	1
some	1
heavy	1
statue	1
hewn	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
age	1
of	1
the	1
Druids.	1
It	1
seemed	1
impossible	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
ever	1
move.	1
Turnbull	1
grew	1
restless	1
with	1
this	1
rigidity,	1
and	1
at	1
last,	1
after	1
calling	1
his	1
companion	1
twice	1
or	1
thrice,	1
went	1
up	1
and	1
clapped	1
him	1
impatiently	1
on	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
big	1
shoulders.	1
Evan	1
winced	1
and	1
leapt	1
away	1
from	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
repulsion	1
which	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
hate	1
of	1
an	1
unclean	1
thing	1
nor	1
the	1
dread	1
of	1
a	1
dangerous	1
one,	1
but	1
was	1
a	1
spasm	1
of	1
awe	1
and	1
separation	1
from	1
something	1
from	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
now	1
sundered	1
as	1
by	1
the	1
sword	1
of	1
God.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
hate	1
the	1
atheist;	1
it	1
is	1
possible	1
that	1
he	1
loved	1
him.	1
But	1
Turnbull	1
was	1
now	1
something	1
more	1
dreadful	1
than	1
an	1
enemy:	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
thing	1
sealed	1
and	1
devoted--a	1
thing	1
now	1
hopelessly	1
doomed	1
to	1
be	1
either	1
a	1
corpse	1
or	1
an	1
executioner.	1
"What	1
is	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
you?"	1
asked	1
Turnbull,	1
with	1
his	1
hearty	1
hand	1
still	1
in	1
the	1
air;	1
and	1
yet	1
he	1
knew	1
more	1
about	1
it	1
than	1
his	1
innocent	1
action	1
would	1
allow.	1
"James,"	1
said	1
Evan,	1
speaking	1
like	1
one	1
under	1
strong	1
bodily	1
pain,	1
"I	1
asked	1
for	1
God's	1
answer	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
got	1
it--got	1
it	1
in	1
my	1
vitals.	1
He	1
knows	1
how	1
weak	1
I	1
am,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
forget	1
the	1
peril	1
of	1
the	1
faith,	1
forget	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
Our	1
Lady--yes,	1
even	1
with	1
your	1
blow	1
upon	1
her	1
cheek.	1
But	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
this	1
earth	1
has	1
just	1
this	1
about	1
it,	1
that	1
it	1
can	1
make	1
a	1
man's	1
heart	1
like	1
iron.	1
I	1
am	1
from	1
the	1
Lords	1
of	1
the	1
Isles	1
and	1
I	1
dare	1
not	1
be	1
a	1
mere	1
deserter.	1
Therefore,	1
God	1
has	1
tied	1
me	1
by	1
the	1
chain	1
of	1
my	1
worldly	1
place	1
and	1
word,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
but	1
fighting	1
now."	1
"I	1
think	1
I	1
understand	1
you,"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
"but	1
you	1
say	1
everything	1
tail	1
foremost."	1
"She	1
wants	1
us	1
to	1
do	1
it,"	1
said	1
Evan,	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
crushed	1
with	1
passion.	1
"She	1
has	1
hurt	1
herself	1
so	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
do	1
it.	1
She	1
has	1
left	1
her	1
good	1
name	1
and	1
her	1
good	1
sleep	1
and	1
all	1
her	1
habits	1
and	1
dignity	1
flung	1
away	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
England	1
in	1
the	1
hope	1
that	1
she	1
may	1
hear	1
of	1
us	1
and	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
broken	1
some	1
hole	1
into	1
heaven."	1
"I	1
thought	1
I	1
knew	1
what	1
you	1
mean,"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
biting	1
his	1
beard;	1
"it	1
does	1
seem	1
as	1
if	1
we	1
ought	1
to	1
do	1
something	1
after	1
all	1
she	1
has	1
done	1
this	1
night."	1
"I	1
never	1
liked	1
you	1
so	1
much	1
before,"	1
said	1
MacIan,	1
in	1
bitter	1
sorrow.	1
As	1
he	1
spoke,	1
three	1
solemn	1
footmen	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
lodge	1
gate	1
and	1
assembled	1
to	1
assist	1
the	1
chauffeur	1
to	1
his	1
room.	1
The	1
mere	1
sight	1
of	1
them	1
made	1
the	1
two	1
wanderers	1
flee	1
as	1
from	1
a	1
too	1
frightful	1
incongruity,	1
and	1
before	1
they	1
knew	1
where	1
they	1
were,	1
they	1
were	1
well	1
upon	1
the	1
grassy	1
ledge	1
of	1
England	1
that	1
overlooks	1
the	1
Channel.	1
Evan	1
said	1
suddenly:	1
"Will	1
they	1
let	1
me	1
see	1
her	1
in	1
heaven	1
once	1
in	1
a	1
thousand	1
ages?"	1
and	1
addressed	1
the	1
remark	1
to	1
the	1
editor	1
of	1
_The	1
Atheist_,	1
as	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
likely	1
or	1
qualified	1
to	1
answer.	1
But	1
no	1
answer	1
came;	1
a	1
silence	1
sank	1
between	1
the	1
two.	1
Turnbull	1
strode	1
sturdily	1
to	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
cliff	1
and	1
looked	1
out,	1
his	1
companion	1
following,	1
somewhat	1
more	1
shaken	1
by	1
his	1
recent	1
agitation.	1
"If	1
that's	1
the	1
view	1
you	1
take,"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
"and	1
I	1
don't	1
say	1
you	1
are	1
wrong,	1
I	1
think	1
I	1
know	1
where	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
best	1
off	1
for	1
the	1
business.	1
As	1
it	1
happens,	1
I	1
know	1
this	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
south	1
coast	1
pretty	1
well.	1
And	1
unless	1
I	1
am	1
mistaken	1
there's	1
a	1
way	1
down	1
the	1
cliff	1
just	1
here	1
which	1
will	1
land	1
us	1
on	1
a	1
stretch	1
of	1
firm	1
sand	1
where	1
no	1
one	1
is	1
likely	1
to	1
follow	1
us."	1
The	1
Highlander	1
made	1
a	1
gesture	1
of	1
assent	1
and	1
came	1
also	1
almost	1
to	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
precipice.	1
The	1
sunrise,	1
which	1
was	1
broadening	1
over	1
sea	1
and	1
shore,	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
rare	1
and	1
splendid	1
ones	1
in	1
which	1
there	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
no	1
mist	1
or	1
doubt,	1
and	1
nothing	1
but	1
a	1
universal	1
clarification	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
complete.	1
All	1
the	1
colours	1
were	1
transparent.	1
It	1
seemed	1
like	1
a	1
triumphant	1
prophecy	1
of	1
some	1
perfect	1
world	1
where	1
everything	1
being	1
innocent	1
will	1
be	1
intelligible;	1
a	1
world	1
where	1
even	1
our	1
bodies,	1
so	1
to	1
speak,	1
may	1
be	1
as	1
of	1
burning	1
glass.	1
Such	1
a	1
world	1
is	1
faintly	1
though	1
fiercely	1
figured	1
in	1
the	1
coloured	1
windows	1
of	1
Christian	1
architecture.	1
The	1
sea	1
that	1
lay	1
before	1
them	1
was	1
like	1
a	1
pavement	1
of	1
emerald,	1
bright	1
and	1
almost	1
brittle;	1
the	1
sky	1
against	1
which	1
its	1
strict	1
horizon	1
hung	1
was	1
almost	1
absolutely	1
white,	1
except	1
that	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
sky	1
line,	1
like	1
scarlet	1
braids	1
on	1
the	1
hem	1
of	1
a	1
garment,	1
lay	1
strings	1
of	1
flaky	1
cloud	1
of	1
so	1
gleaming	1
and	1
gorgeous	1
a	1
red	1
that	1
they	1
seemed	1
cut	1
out	1
of	1
some	1
strange	1
blood-red	1
celestial	1
metal,	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
mere	1
gold	1
of	1
this	1
earth	1
is	1
but	1
a	1
drab	1
yellow	1
imitation.	1
"The	1
hand	1
of	1
Heaven	1
is	1
still	1
pointing,"	1
muttered	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
superstition	1
to	1
himself.	1
"And	1
now	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
blood-red	1
hand."	1
The	1
cool	1
voice	1
of	1
his	1
companion	1
cut	1
in	1
upon	1
his	1
monologue,	1
calling	1
to	1
him	1
from	1
a	1
little	1
farther	1
along	1
the	1
cliff,	1
to	1
tell	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
found	1
the	1
ladder	1
of	1
descent.	1
It	1
began	1
as	1
a	1
steep	1
and	1
somewhat	1
greasy	1
path,	1
which	1
then	1
tumbled	1
down	1
twenty	1
or	1
thirty	1
feet	1
in	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
a	1
fall	1
of	1
rough	1
stone	1
steps.	1
After	1
that,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
rather	1
awkward	1
drop	1
on	1
to	1
a	1
ledge	1
of	1
stone	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
journey	1
was	1
undertaken	1
easily	1
and	1
even	1
elegantly	1
by	1
the	1
remains	1
of	1
an	1
ornamental	1
staircase,	1
such	1
as	1
might	1
have	1
belonged	1
to	1
some	1
long-disused	1
watering-place.	1
All	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
the	1
two	1
travellers	1
sank	1
from	1
stage	1
to	1
stage	1
of	1
this	1
downward	1
journey,	1
there	1
closed	1
over	1
their	1
heads	1
living	1
bridges	1
and	1
caverns	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
varied	1
foliage,	1
all	1
of	1
which	1
grew	1
greener,	1
redder,	1
or	1
more	1
golden,	1
in	1
the	1
growing	1
sunlight	1
of	1
the	1
morning.	1
Life,	1
too,	1
of	1
the	1
more	1
moving	1
sort	1
rose	1
at	1
the	1
sun	1
on	1
every	1
side	1
of	1
them.	1
Birds	1
whirred	1
and	1
fluttered	1
in	1
the	1
undergrowth,	1
as	1
if	1
imprisoned	1
in	1
green	1
cages.	1
Other	1
birds	1
were	1
shaken	1
up	1
in	1
great	1
clouds	1
from	1
the	1
tree-tops,	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
blossoms	1
detached	1
and	1
scattered	1
up	1
to	1
heaven.	1
Animals	1
which	1
Turnbull	1
was	1
too	1
much	1
of	1
a	1
Londoner	1
and	1
MacIan	1
too	1
much	1
of	1
a	1
Northerner	1
to	1
know,	1
slipped	1
by	1
among	1
the	1
tangle	1
or	1
ran	1
pattering	1
up	1
the	1
tree-trunks.	1
Both	1
the	1
men,	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
several	1
creeds,	1
felt	1
the	1
full	1
thunder	1
of	1
the	1
psalm	1
of	1
life	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
never	1
heard	1
it	1
before;	1
MacIan	1
felt	1
God	1
the	1
Father,	1
benignant	1
in	1
all	1
His	1
energies,	1
and	1
Turnbull	1
that	1
ultimate	1
anonymous	1
energy,	1
that	1
_Natura	1
Naturans_,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
whole	1
theme	1
of	1
Lucretius.	1
It	1
was	1
down	1
this	1
clamorous	1
ladder	1
of	1
life	1
that	1
they	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
die.	1
They	1
broke	1
out	1
upon	1
a	1
brown	1
semicircle	1
of	1
sand,	1
so	1
free	1
from	1
human	1
imprint	1
as	1
to	1
justify	1
Turnbull's	1
profession.	1
They	1
strode	1
out	1
upon	1
it,	1
stuck	1
their	1
swords	1
in	1
the	1
sand,	1
and	1
had	1
a	1
pause	1
too	1
important	1
for	1
speech.	1
Turnbull	1
eyed	1
the	1
coast	1
curiously	1
for	1
a	1
moment,	1
like	1
one	1
awakening	1
memories	1
of	1
childhood;	1
then	1
he	1
said	1
abruptly,	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
remembering	1
somebody's	1
name:	1
"But,	1
of	1
course,	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
better	1
off	1
still	1
round	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
Cragness	1
Point;	1
nobody	1
ever	1
comes	1
there	1
at	1
all."	1
And	1
picking	1
up	1
his	1
sword	1
again,	1
he	1
began	1
striding	1
towards	1
a	1
big	1
bluff	1
of	1
the	1
rocks	1
which	1
stood	1
out	1
upon	1
their	1
left.	1
MacIan	1
followed	1
him	1
round	1
the	1
corner	1
and	1
found	1
himself	1
in	1
what	1
was	1
certainly	1
an	1
even	1
finer	1
fencing	1
court,	1
of	1
flat,	1
firm	1
sand,	1
enclosed	1
on	1
three	1
sides	1
by	1
white	1
walls	1
of	1
rock,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
fourth	1
by	1
the	1
green	1
wall	1
of	1
the	1
advancing	1
sea.	1
"We	1
are	1
quite	1
safe	1
here,"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
and,	1
to	1
the	1
other's	1
surprise,	1
flung	1
himself	1
down,	1
sitting	1
on	1
the	1
brown	1
beach.	1
"You	1
see,	1
I	1
was	1
brought	1
up	1
near	1
here,"	1
he	1
explained.	1
"I	1
was	1
sent	1
from	1
Scotland	1
to	1
stop	1
with	1
my	1
aunt.	1
It	1
is	1
highly	1
probable	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
die	1
here.	1
Do	1
you	1
mind	1
if	1
I	1
light	1
a	1
pipe?"	1
"Of	1
course,	1
do	1
whatever	1
you	1
like,"	1
said	1
MacIan,	1
with	1
a	1
choking	1
voice,	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
and	1
walked	1
alone	1
by	1
himself	1
along	1
the	1
wet,	1
glistening	1
sands.	1
Ten	1
minutes	1
afterwards	1
he	1
came	1
back	1
again,	1
white	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
whirlwind	1
of	1
emotions;	1
Turnbull	1
was	1
quite	1
cheerful	1
and	1
was	1
knocking	1
out	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
his	1
pipe.	1
"You	1
see,	1
we	1
have	1
to	1
do	1
it,"	1
said	1
MacIan.	1
"She	1
tied	1
us	1
to	1
it."	1
"Of	1
course,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow,"	1
said	1
the	1
other,	1
and	1
leapt	1
up	1
as	1
lightly	1
as	1
a	1
monkey.	1
They	1
took	1
their	1
places	1
gravely	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
centre	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
square	1
of	1
sand,	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
thousands	1
of	1
spectators.	1
Before	1
saluting,	1
MacIan,	1
who,	1
being	1
a	1
mystic,	1
was	1
one	1
inch	1
nearer	1
to	1
Nature,	1
cast	1
his	1
eye	1
round	1
the	1
huge	1
framework	1
of	1
their	1
heroic	1
folly.	1
The	1
three	1
walls	1
of	1
rock	1
all	1
leant	1
a	1
little	1
outward,	1
though	1
at	1
various	1
angles;	1
but	1
this	1
impression	1
was	1
exaggerated	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
the	1
incredible	1
by	1
the	1
heavy	1
load	1
of	1
living	1
trees	1
and	1
thickets	1
which	1
each	1
wall	1
wore	1
on	1
its	1
top	1
like	1
a	1
huge	1
shock	1
of	1
hair.	1
On	1
all	1
that	1
luxurious	1
crest	1
of	1
life	1
the	1
risen	1
and	1
victorious	1
sun	1
was	1
beating,	1
burnishing	1
it	1
all	1
like	1
gold,	1
and	1
every	1
bird	1
that	1
rose	1
with	1
that	1
sunrise	1
caught	1
a	1
light	1
like	1
a	1
star	1
upon	1
it	1
like	1
the	1
dove	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Spirit.	1
Imaginative	1
life	1
had	1
never	1
so	1
much	1
crowded	1
upon	1
MacIan.	1
He	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
write	1
whole	1
books	1
about	1
the	1
feelings	1
of	1
a	1
single	1
bird.	1
He	1
felt	1
that	1
for	1
two	1
centuries	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
tire	1
of	1
being	1
a	1
rabbit.	1
He	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
Palace	1
of	1
Life,	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
very	1
tapestries	1
and	1
curtains	1
were	1
alive.	1
Then	1
he	1
recovered	1
himself,	1
and	1
remembered	1
his	1
affairs.	1
Both	1
men	1
saluted,	1
and	1
iron	1
rang	1
upon	1
iron.	1
It	1
was	1
exactly	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
moment	1
that	1
he	1
realized	1
that	1
his	1
enemy's	1
left	1
ankle	1
was	1
encircled	1
with	1
a	1
ring	1
of	1
salt	1
water	1
that	1
had	1
crept	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
feet.	1
"What	1
is	1
the	1
matter?"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
stopping	1
an	1
instant,	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
grown	1
used	1
to	1
every	1
movement	1
of	1
his	1
extraordinary	1
fellow-traveller's	1
face.	1
MacIan	1
glanced	1
again	1
at	1
that	1
silver	1
anklet	1
of	1
sea-water	1
and	1
then	1
looked	1
beyond	1
at	1
the	1
next	1
promontory	1
round	1
which	1
a	1
deep	1
sea	1
was	1
boiling	1
and	1
leaping.	1
Then	1
he	1
turned	1
and	1
looked	1
back	1
and	1
saw	1
heavy	1
foam	1
being	1
shaken	1
up	1
to	1
heaven	1
about	1
the	1
base	1
of	1
Cragness	1
Point.	1
"The	1
sea	1
has	1
cut	1
us	1
off,"	1
he	1
said,	1
curtly.	1
"I	1
have	1
noticed	1
it,"	1
said	1
Turnbull	1
with	1
equal	1
sobriety.	1
"What	1
view	1
do	1
you	1
take	1
of	1
the	1
development?"	1
Evan	1
threw	1
away	1
his	1
weapon,	1
and,	1
as	1
his	1
custom	1
was,	1
imprisoned	1
his	1
big	1
head	1
in	1
his	1
hands.	1
Then	1
he	1
let	1
them	1
fall	1
and	1
said:	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
know	1
what	1
it	1
means;	1
and	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
fairest	1
thing.	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
finger	1
of	1
God--red	1
as	1
blood--still	1
pointing.	1
But	1
now	1
it	1
points	1
to	1
two	1
graves."	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
space	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
then	1
MacIan	1
spoke	1
again	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
pathetically	1
reasonable:	1
"You	1
see,	1
we	1
both	1
saved	1
her--and	1
she	1
told	1
us	1
both	1
to	1
fight--and	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
just	1
that	1
either	1
should	1
fail	1
and	1
fall	1
alone,	1
while	1
the	1
other----"	1
"You	1
mean,"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
surprisingly	1
soft	1
and	1
gentle,	1
"that	1
there	1
is	1
something	1
fine	1
about	1
fighting	1
in	1
a	1
place	1
where	1
even	1
the	1
conqueror	1
must	1
die?"	1
"Oh,	1
you	1
have	1
got	1
it	1
right,	1
you	1
have	1
got	1
it	1
right!"	1
cried	1
out	1
Evan,	1
in	1
an	1
extraordinary	1
childish	1
ecstasy.	1
"Oh,	1
I'm	1
sure	1
that	1
you	1
really	1
believe	1
in	1
God!"	1
Turnbull	1
answered	1
not	1
a	1
word,	1
but	1
only	1
took	1
up	1
his	1
fallen	1
sword.	1
For	1
the	1
third	1
time	1
Evan	1
MacIan	1
looked	1
at	1
those	1
three	1
sides	1
of	1
English	1
cliff	1
hung	1
with	1
their	1
noisy	1
load	1
of	1
life.	1
He	1
had	1
been	1
at	1
a	1
loss	1
to	1
understand	1
the	1
almost	1
ironical	1
magnificence	1
of	1
all	1
those	1
teeming	1
creatures	1
and	1
tropical	1
colours	1
and	1
smells	1
that	1
smoked	1
happily	1
to	1
heaven.	1
But	1
now	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
closed	1
court	1
of	1
death	1
and	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
gates	1
were	1
sealed.	1
He	1
drank	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
green	1
and	1
the	1
last	1
red	1
and	1
the	1
last	1
gold,	1
those	1
unique	1
and	1
indescribable	1
things	1
of	1
God,	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
drains	1
good	1
wine	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
his	1
glass.	1
Then	1
he	1
turned	1
and	1
saluted	1
his	1
enemy	1
once	1
more,	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
stood	1
up	1
and	1
fought	1
till	1
the	1
foam	1
flowed	1
over	1
their	1
knees.	1
Then	1
MacIan	1
stepped	1
backward	1
suddenly	1
with	1
a	1
splash	1
and	1
held	1
up	1
his	1
hand.	1
"Turnbull!"	1
he	1
cried;	1
"I	1
can't	1
help	1
it--fair	1
fighting	1
is	1
more	1
even	1
than	1
promises.	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
not	1
fair	1
fighting."	1
"What	1
the	1
deuce	1
do	1
you	1
mean?"	1
asked	1
the	1
other,	1
staring.	1
"I've	1
only	1
just	1
thought	1
of	1
it,"	1
cried	1
Evan,	1
brokenly.	1
"We're	1
very	1
well	1
matched--it	1
may	1
go	1
on	1
a	1
good	1
time--the	1
tide	1
is	1
coming	1
up	1
fast--and	1
I'm	1
a	1
foot	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
taller.	1
You'll	1
be	1
washed	1
away	1
like	1
seaweed	1
before	1
it's	1
above	1
my	1
breeches.	1
I'll	1
not	1
fight	1
foul	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
girls	1
and	1
angels	1
in	1
the	1
universe."	1
"Will	1
you	1
oblige	1
me,"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
with	1
staring	1
grey	1
eyes	1
and	1
a	1
voice	1
of	1
distinct	1
and	1
violent	1
politeness;	1
"will	1
you	1
oblige	1
me	1
by	1
jolly	1
well	1
minding	1
your	1
own	1
business?	1
Just	1
you	1
stand	1
up	1
and	1
fight,	1
and	1
we'll	1
see	1
who	1
will	1
be	1
washed	1
away	1
like	1
seaweed.	1
You	1
wanted	1
to	1
finish	1
this	1
fight	1
and	1
you	1
shall	1
finish	1
it,	1
or	1
I'll	1
denounce	1
you	1
as	1
a	1
coward	1
to	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
that	1
assembled	1
company."	1
Evan	1
looked	1
very	1
doubtful	1
and	1
offered	1
a	1
somewhat	1
wavering	1
weapon;	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
quickly	1
brought	1
back	1
to	1
his	1
senses	1
by	1
his	1
opponent's	1
sword-point,	1
which	1
shot	1
past	1
him,	1
shaving	1
his	1
shoulder	1
by	1
a	1
hair.	1
By	1
this	1
time	1
the	1
waves	1
were	1
well	1
up	1
Turnbull's	1
thigh,	1
and	1
what	1
was	1
worse,	1
they	1
were	1
beginning	1
to	1
roll	1
and	1
break	1
heavily	1
around	1
them.	1
MacIan	1
parried	1
this	1
first	1
lunge	1
perfectly,	1
the	1
next	1
less	1
perfectly;	1
the	1
third	1
in	1
all	1
human	1
probability	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
parried	1
at	1
all;	1
the	1
Christian	1
champion	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
pinned	1
like	1
a	1
butterfly,	1
and	1
the	1
atheistic	1
champion	1
left	1
to	1
drown	1
like	1
a	1
rat,	1
with	1
such	1
consolation	1
as	1
his	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
cosmos	1
afforded	1
him.	1
But	1
just	1
as	1
Turnbull	1
launched	1
his	1
heaviest	1
stroke,	1
the	1
sea,	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
stood	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
hips,	1
launched	1
a	1
yet	1
heavier	1
one.	1
A	1
wave	1
breaking	1
beyond	1
the	1
others	1
smote	1
him	1
heavily	1
like	1
a	1
hammer	1
of	1
water.	1
One	1
leg	1
gave	1
way,	1
he	1
was	1
swung	1
round	1
and	1
sucked	1
into	1
the	1
retreating	1
sea,	1
still	1
gripping	1
his	1
sword.	1
MacIan	1
put	1
his	1
sword	1
between	1
his	1
teeth	1
and	1
plunged	1
after	1
his	1
disappearing	1
enemy.	1
He	1
had	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
having	1
the	1
whole	1
universe	1
on	1
top	1
of	1
him	1
as	1
crest	1
after	1
crest	1
struck	1
him	1
down.	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
quite	1
a	1
cosmic	1
collapse,	1
as	1
if	1
all	1
the	1
seven	1
heavens	1
were	1
falling	1
on	1
him	1
one	1
after	1
the	1
other.	1
But	1
he	1
got	1
hold	1
of	1
the	1
atheist's	1
left	1
leg	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
let	1
it	1
go.	1
After	1
some	1
ten	1
minutes	1
of	1
foam	1
and	1
frenzy,	1
in	1
which	1
all	1
the	1
senses	1
at	1
once	1
seemed	1
blasted	1
by	1
the	1
sea,	1
Evan	1
found	1
himself	1
laboriously	1
swimming	1
on	1
a	1
low,	1
green	1
swell,	1
with	1
the	1
sword	1
still	1
in	1
his	1
teeth	1
and	1
the	1
editor	1
of	1
_The	1
Atheist_	1
still	1
under	1
his	1
arm.	1
What	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
do	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
even	1
the	1
most	1
glimmering	1
idea;	1
so	1
he	1
merely	1
kept	1
his	1
grip	1
and	1
swam	1
somehow	1
with	1
one	1
hand.	1
He	1
ducked	1
instinctively	1
as	1
there	1
bulked	1
above	1
him	1
a	1
big,	1
black	1
wave,	1
much	1
higher	1
than	1
any	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
seen.	1
Then	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
hardly	1
the	1
shape	1
of	1
any	1
possible	1
wave.	1
Then	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
fisherman's	1
boat,	1
and,	1
leaping	1
upward,	1
caught	1
hold	1
of	1
the	1
bow.	1
The	1
boat	1
pitched	1
forward	1
with	1
its	1
stern	1
in	1
the	1
air	1
for	1
just	1
as	1
much	1
time	1
as	1
was	1
needed	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
nobody	1
in	1
it.	1
After	1
a	1
moment	1
or	1
two	1
of	1
desperate	1
clambering,	1
however,	1
there	1
were	1
two	1
people	1
in	1
it,	1
Mr.	1
Evan	1
MacIan,	1
panting	1
and	1
sweating,	1
and	1
Mr.	1
James	1
Turnbull,	1
uncommonly	1
close	1
to	1
being	1
drowned.	1
After	1
ten	1
minutes'	1
aimless	1
tossing	1
in	1
the	1
empty	1
fishing-boat	1
he	1
recovered,	1
however,	1
stirred,	1
stretched	1
himself,	1
and	1
looked	1
round	1
on	1
the	1
rolling	1
waters.	1
Then,	1
while	1
taking	1
no	1
notice	1
of	1
the	1
streams	1
of	1
salt	1
water	1
that	1
were	1
pouring	1
from	1
his	1
hair,	1
beard,	1
coat,	1
boots,	1
and	1
trousers,	1
he	1
carefully	1
wiped	1
the	1
wet	1
off	1
his	1
sword-blade	1
to	1
preserve	1
it	1
from	1
the	1
possibilities	1
of	1
rust.	1
MacIan	1
found	1
two	1
oars	1
in	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
deserted	1
boat	1
and	1
began	1
somewhat	1
drearily	1
to	1
row.	1
*	1
*	1
*	1
A	1
rainy	1
twilight	1
was	1
clearing	1
to	1
cold	1
silver	1
over	1
the	1
moaning	1
sea,	1
when	1
the	1
battered	1
boat	1
that	1
had	1
rolled	1
and	1
drifted	1
almost	1
aimlessly	1
all	1
night,	1
came	1
within	1
sight	1
of	1
land,	1
though	1
of	1
land	1
which	1
looked	1
almost	1
as	1
lost	1
and	1
savage	1
as	1
the	1
waves.	1
All	1
night	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
but	1
little	1
lifting	1
in	1
the	1
leaden	1
sea,	1
only	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
boat	1
had	1
been	1
heaved	1
up,	1
as	1
on	1
a	1
huge	1
shoulder	1
which	1
slipped	1
from	1
under	1
it;	1
such	1
occasional	1
sea-quakes	1
came	1
probably	1
from	1
the	1
swell	1
of	1
some	1
steamer	1
that	1
had	1
passed	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
dark;	1
otherwise	1
the	1
waves	1
were	1
harmless	1
though	1
restless.	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
piercingly	1
cold,	1
and	1
there	1
was,	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time,	1
a	1
splutter	1
of	1
rain	1
like	1
the	1
splutter	1
of	1
the	1
spray,	1
which	1
seemed	1
almost	1
to	1
freeze	1
as	1
it	1
fell.	1
MacIan,	1
more	1
at	1
home	1
than	1
his	1
companion	1
in	1
this	1
quite	1
barbarous	1
and	1
elemental	1
sort	1
of	1
adventure,	1
had	1
rowed	1
toilsomely	1
with	1
the	1
heavy	1
oars	1
whenever	1
he	1
saw	1
anything	1
that	1
looked	1
like	1
land;	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
part	1
had	1
trusted	1
with	1
grim	1
transcendentalism	1
to	1
wind	1
and	1
tide.	1
Among	1
the	1
implements	1
of	1
their	1
first	1
outfit	1
the	1
brandy	1
alone	1
had	1
remained	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
gave	1
it	1
to	1
his	1
freezing	1
companion	1
in	1
quantities	1
which	1
greatly	1
alarmed	1
that	1
temperate	1
Londoner;	1
but	1
MacIan	1
came	1
from	1
the	1
cold	1
seas	1
and	1
mists	1
where	1
a	1
man	1
can	1
drink	1
a	1
tumbler	1
of	1
raw	1
whisky	1
in	1
a	1
boat	1
without	1
it	1
making	1
him	1
wink.	1
When	1
the	1
Highlander	1
began	1
to	1
pull	1
really	1
hard	1
upon	1
the	1
oars,	1
Turnbull	1
craned	1
his	1
dripping	1
red	1
head	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
boat	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
goal	1
of	1
his	1
exertions.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
sufficiently	1
uninviting	1
one;	1
nothing	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
could	1
be	1
seen	1
but	1
a	1
steep	1
and	1
shelving	1
bank	1
of	1
shingle,	1
made	1
of	1
loose	1
little	1
pebbles	1
such	1
as	1
children	1
like,	1
but	1
slanting	1
up	1
higher	1
than	1
a	1
house.	1
On	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
mound,	1
against	1
the	1
sky	1
line,	1
stood	1
up	1
the	1
brown	1
skeleton	1
of	1
some	1
broken	1
fence	1
or	1
breakwater.	1
With	1
the	1
grey	1
and	1
watery	1
dawn	1
crawling	1
up	1
behind	1
it,	1
the	1
fence	1
really	1
seemed	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
our	1
philosophic	1
adventurers	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
come	1
at	1
last	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
end	1
of	1
nowhere.	1
Bent	1
by	1
necessity	1
to	1
his	1
labour,	1
MacIan	1
managed	1
the	1
heavy	1
boat	1
with	1
real	1
power	1
and	1
skill,	1
and	1
when	1
at	1
length	1
he	1
ran	1
it	1
up	1
on	1
a	1
smoother	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
slope	1
it	1
caught	1
and	1
held	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
clamber	1
out,	1
not	1
sinking	1
farther	1
than	1
their	1
knees	1
into	1
the	1
water	1
and	1
the	1
shingle.	1
A	1
foot	1
or	1
two	1
farther	1
up	1
their	1
feet	1
found	1
the	1
beach	1
firmer,	1
and	1
a	1
few	1
moments	1
afterwards	1
they	1
were	1
leaning	1
on	1
the	1
ragged	1
breakwater	1
and	1
looking	1
back	1
at	1
the	1
sea	1
they	1
had	1
escaped.	1
They	1
had	1
a	1
dreary	1
walk	1
across	1
wastes	1
of	1
grey	1
shingle	1
in	1
the	1
grey	1
dawn	1
before	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
come	1
within	1
hail	1
of	1
human	1
fields	1
or	1
roads;	1
nor	1
had	1
they	1
any	1
notion	1
of	1
what	1
fields	1
or	1
roads	1
they	1
would	1
be.	1
Their	1
boots	1
were	1
beginning	1
to	1
break	1
up	1
and	1
the	1
confusion	1
of	1
stones	1
tried	1
them	1
severely,	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
glad	1
to	1
lean	1
on	1
their	1
swords,	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
the	1
staves	1
of	1
pilgrims.	1
MacIan	1
thought	1
vaguely	1
of	1
a	1
weird	1
ballad	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
country	1
which	1
describes	1
the	1
soul	1
in	1
Purgatory	1
as	1
walking	1
on	1
a	1
plain	1
full	1
of	1
sharp	1
stones,	1
and	1
only	1
saved	1
by	1
its	1
own	1
charities	1
upon	1
earth.	1
If	1
ever	1
thou	1
gavest	1
hosen	1
and	1
shoon	1
Every	1
night	1
and	1
all,	1
Sit	1
thee	1
down	1
and	1
put	1
them	1
on,	1
And	1
Christ	1
receive	1
thy	1
soul.	1
Turnbull	1
had	1
no	1
such	1
lyrical	1
meditations,	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
an	1
even	1
worse	1
temper.	1
At	1
length	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
pale	1
ribbon	1
of	1
road,	1
edged	1
by	1
a	1
shelf	1
of	1
rough	1
and	1
almost	1
colourless	1
turf;	1
and	1
a	1
few	1
feet	1
up	1
the	1
slope	1
there	1
stood	1
grey	1
and	1
weather-stained,	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
big	1
wayside	1
crucifixes	1
which	1
are	1
seldom	1
seen	1
except	1
in	1
Catholic	1
countries.	1
MacIan	1
put	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
found	1
that	1
his	1
bonnet	1
was	1
not	1
there.	1
Turnbull	1
gave	1
one	1
glance	1
at	1
the	1
crucifix--a	1
glance	1
at	1
once	1
sympathetic	1
and	1
bitter,	1
in	1
which	1
was	1
concentrated	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
Swinburne's	1
poem	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
occasion.	1
O	1
hidden	1
face	1
of	1
man,	1
whereover	1
The	1
years	1
have	1
woven	1
a	1
viewless	1
veil,	1
If	1
thou	1
wert	1
verily	1
man's	1
lover	1
What	1
did	1
thy	1
love	1
or	1
blood	1
avail?	1
Thy	1
blood	1
the	1
priests	1
mix	1
poison	1
of,	1
And	1
in	1
gold	1
shekels	1
coin	1
thy	1
love.	1
Then,	1
leaving	1
MacIan	1
in	1
his	1
attitude	1
of	1
prayer,	1
Turnbull	1
began	1
to	1
look	1
right	1
and	1
left	1
very	1
sharply,	1
like	1
one	1
looking	1
for	1
something.	1
Suddenly,	1
with	1
a	1
little	1
cry,	1
he	1
saw	1
it	1
and	1
ran	1
forward.	1
A	1
few	1
yards	1
from	1
them	1
along	1
the	1
road	1
a	1
lean	1
and	1
starved	1
sort	1
of	1
hedge	1
came	1
pitifully	1
to	1
an	1
end.	1
Caught	1
upon	1
its	1
prickly	1
angle,	1
however,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
small	1
and	1
very	1
dirty	1
scrap	1
of	1
paper	1
that	1
might	1
have	1
hung	1
there	1
for	1
months,	1
since	1
it	1
escaped	1
from	1
someone	1
tearing	1
up	1
a	1
letter	1
or	1
making	1
a	1
spill	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
newspaper.	1
Turnbull	1
snatched	1
at	1
it	1
and	1
found	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
a	1
printed	1
page,	1
very	1
coarsely	1
printed,	1
like	1
a	1
cheap	1
novelette,	1
and	1
just	1
large	1
enough	1
to	1
contain	1
the	1
words:	1
"_et	1
c'est	1
elle	1
qui_----"	1
"Hurrah!"	1
cried	1
Turnbull,	1
waving	1
his	1
fragment;	1
"we	1
are	1
safe	1
at	1
last.	1
We	1
are	1
free	1
at	1
last.	1
We	1
are	1
somewhere	1
better	1
than	1
England	1
or	1
Eden	1
or	1
Paradise.	1
MacIan,	1
we	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
Land	1
of	1
the	1
Duel!"	1
"Where	1
do	1
you	1
say?"	1
said	1
the	1
other,	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
heavily	1
and	1
with	1
knitted	1
brows,	1
like	1
one	1
almost	1
dazed	1
with	1
the	1
grey	1
doubts	1
of	1
desolate	1
twilight	1
and	1
drifting	1
sea.	1
"We	1
are	1
in	1
France!"	1
cried	1
Turnbull,	1
with	1
a	1
voice	1
like	1
a	1
trumpet,	1
"in	1
the	1
land	1
where	1
things	1
really	1
happen--_Tout	1
arrive	1
en	1
France_.	1
We	1
arrive	1
in	1
France.	1
Look	1
at	1
this	1
little	1
message,"	1
and	1
he	1
held	1
out	1
the	1
scrap	1
of	1
paper.	1
"There's	1
an	1
omen	1
for	1
you	1
superstitious	1
hill	1
folk.	1
_C'est	1
elle	1
qui--Mais	1
oui,	1
mais	1
oui,	1
c'est	1
elle	1
qui	1
sauvera	1
encore	1
le	1
monde_."	1
"France!"	1
repeated	1
MacIan,	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
awoke	1
again	1
in	1
his	1
head	1
like	1
large	1
lamps	1
lighted.	1
"Yes,	1
France!"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
rhetorical	1
part	1
of	1
him	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
top,	1
his	1
face	1
growing	1
as	1
red	1
as	1
his	1
hair.	1
"France,	1
that	1
has	1
always	1
been	1
in	1
rebellion	1
for	1
liberty	1
and	1
reason.	1
France,	1
that	1
has	1
always	1
assailed	1
superstition	1
with	1
the	1
club	1
of	1
Rabelais	1
or	1
the	1
rapier	1
of	1
Voltaire.	1
France,	1
at	1
whose	1
first	1
council	1
table	1
sits	1
the	1
sublime	1
figure	1
of	1
Julian	1
the	1
Apostate.	1
France,	1
where	1
a	1
man	1
said	1
only	1
the	1
other	1
day	1
those	1
splendid	1
unanswerable	1
words"--with	1
a	1
superb	1
gesture--"'we	1
have	1
extinguished	1
in	1
heaven	1
those	1
lights	1
that	1
men	1
shall	1
never	1
light	1
again.'"	1
"No,"	1
said	1
MacIan,	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
that	1
shook	1
with	1
a	1
controlled	1
passion.	1
"But	1
France,	1
which	1
was	1
taught	1
by	1
St.	1
Bernard	1
and	1
led	1
to	1
war	1
by	1
Joan	1
of	1
Arc.	1
France	1
that	1
made	1
the	1
crusades.	1
France	1
that	1
saved	1
the	1
Church	1
and	1
scattered	1
the	1
heresies	1
by	1
the	1
mouths	1
of	1
Bossuet	1
and	1
Massillon.	1
France,	1
which	1
shows	1
today	1
the	1
conquering	1
march	1
of	1
Catholicism,	1
as	1
brain	1
after	1
brain	1
surrenders	1
to	1
it,	1
Bruneti�re,	1
Copp�e,	1
Hauptmann,	1
Barr�s,	1
Bourget,	1
Lema�tre."	1
"France!"	1
asserted	1
Turnbull	1
with	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
rollicking	1
self-exaggeration,	1
very	1
unusual	1
with	1
him,	1
"France,	1
which	1
is	1
one	1
torrent	1
of	1
splendid	1
scepticism	1
from	1
Abelard	1
to	1
Anatole	1
France."	1
"France,"	1
said	1
MacIan,	1
"which	1
is	1
one	1
cataract	1
of	1
clear	1
faith	1
from	1
St.	1
Louis	1
to	1
Our	1
Lady	1
of	1
Lourdes."	1
"France	1
at	1
least,"	1
cried	1
Turnbull,	1
throwing	1
up	1
his	1
sword	1
in	1
schoolboy	1
triumph,	1
"in	1
which	1
these	1
things	1
are	1
thought	1
about	1
and	1
fought	1
about.	1
France,	1
where	1
reason	1
and	1
religion	1
clash	1
in	1
one	1
continual	1
tournament.	1
France,	1
above	1
all,	1
where	1
men	1
understand	1
the	1
pride	1
and	1
passion	1
which	1
have	1
plucked	1
our	1
blades	1
from	1
their	1
scabbards.	1
Here,	1
at	1
least,	1
we	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
chased	1
and	1
spied	1
on	1
by	1
sickly	1
parsons	1
and	1
greasy	1
policemen,	1
because	1
we	1
wish	1
to	1
put	1
our	1
lives	1
on	1
the	1
game.	1
Courage,	1
my	1
friend,	1
we	1
have	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
country	1
of	1
honour."	1
MacIan	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
notice	1
the	1
incongruous	1
phrase	1
"my	1
friend",	1
but	1
nodding	1
again	1
and	1
again,	1
drew	1
his	1
sword	1
and	1
flung	1
the	1
scabbard	1
far	1
behind	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
road.	1
"Yes,"	1
he	1
cried,	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
of	1
thunder,	1
"we	1
will	1
fight	1
here	1
and	1
_He_	1
shall	1
look	1
on	1
at	1
it."	1
Turnbull	1
glanced	1
at	1
the	1
crucifix	1
with	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
scowling	1
good-humour	1
and	1
then	1
said:	1
"He	1
may	1
look	1
and	1
see	1
His	1
cross	1
defeated."	1
"The	1
cross	1
cannot	1
be	1
defeated,"	1
said	1
MacIan,	1
"for	1
it	1
is	1
Defeat."	1
A	1
second	1
afterwards	1
the	1
two	1
bright,	1
blood-thirsty	1
weapons	1
made	1
the	1
sign	1
of	1
the	1
cross	1
in	1
horrible	1
parody	1
upon	1
each	1
other.	1
They	1
had	1
not	1
touched	1
each	1
other	1
twice,	1
however,	1
when	1
upon	1
the	1
hill,	1
above	1
the	1
crucifix,	1
there	1
appeared	1
another	1
horrible	1
parody	1
of	1
its	1
shape;	1
the	1
figure	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
appeared	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
waving	1
his	1
outspread	1
arms.	1
He	1
had	1
vanished	1
in	1
an	1
instant;	1
but	1
MacIan,	1
whose	1
fighting	1
face	1
was	1
set	1
that	1
way,	1
had	1
seen	1
the	1
shape	1
momentarily	1
but	1
quite	1
photographically.	1
And	1
while	1
it	1
was	1
like	1
a	1
comic	1
repetition	1
of	1
the	1
cross,	1
it	1
was	1
also,	1
in	1
that	1
place	1
and	1
hour,	1
something	1
more	1
incredible.	1
It	1
had	1
been	1
only	1
instantaneously	1
on	1
the	1
retina	1
of	1
his	1
eye;	1
but	1
unless	1
his	1
eye	1
and	1
mind	1
were	1
going	1
mad	1
together,	1
the	1
figure	1
was	1
that	1
of	1
an	1
ordinary	1
London	1
policeman.	1
He	1
tried	1
to	1
concentrate	1
his	1
senses	1
on	1
the	1
sword-play;	1
but	1
one	1
half	1
of	1
his	1
brain	1
was	1
wrestling	1
with	1
the	1
puzzle;	1
the	1
apocalyptic	1
and	1
almost	1
seraphic	1
apparition	1
of	1
a	1
stout	1
constable	1
out	1
of	1
Clapham	1
on	1
top	1
of	1
a	1
dreary	1
and	1
deserted	1
hill	1
in	1
France.	1
He	1
did	1
not,	1
however,	1
have	1
to	1
puzzle	1
long.	1
Before	1
the	1
duellists	1
had	1
exchanged	1
half	1
a	1
dozen	1
passes,	1
the	1
big,	1
blue	1
policeman	1
appeared	1
once	1
more	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
hill,	1
a	1
palpable	1
monstrosity	1
in	1
the	1
eye	1
of	1
heaven.	1
He	1
was	1
waving	1
only	1
one	1
arm	1
now	1
and	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
shouting	1
directions.	1
At	1
the	1
same	1
moment	1
a	1
mass	1
of	1
blue	1
blocked	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
road	1
behind	1
the	1
small,	1
smart	1
figure	1
of	1
Turnbull,	1
and	1
a	1
small	1
company	1
of	1
policemen	1
in	1
the	1
English	1
uniform	1
came	1
up	1
at	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
half-military	1
double.	1
Turnbull	1
saw	1
the	1
stare	1
of	1
consternation	1
in	1
his	1
enemy's	1
face	1
and	1
swung	1
round	1
to	1
share	1
its	1
cause.	1
When	1
he	1
saw	1
it,	1
cool	1
as	1
he	1
was,	1
he	1
staggered	1
back.	1
"What	1
the	1
devil	1
are	1
you	1
doing	1
here?"	1
he	1
called	1
out	1
in	1
a	1
high,	1
shrill	1
voice	1
of	1
authority,	1
like	1
one	1
who	1
finds	1
a	1
tramp	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
larder.	1
"Well,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
the	1
sergeant	1
in	1
command,	1
with	1
that	1
sort	1
of	1
heavy	1
civility	1
shown	1
only	1
to	1
the	1
evidently	1
guilty,	1
"seems	1
to	1
me	1
we	1
might	1
ask	1
what	1
are	1
you	1
doing	1
here?"	1
"We	1
are	1
having	1
an	1
affair	1
of	1
honour,"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
the	1
most	1
rational	1
thing	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
"If	1
the	1
French	1
police	1
like	1
to	1
interfere,	1
let	1
them	1
interfere.	1
But	1
why	1
the	1
blue	1
blazes	1
should	1
you	1
interfere,	1
you	1
great	1
blue	1
blundering	1
sausages?"	1
"I'm	1
afraid,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
the	1
sergeant	1
with	1
restraint,	1
"I'm	1
afraid	1
I	1
don't	1
quite	1
follow	1
you."	1
"I	1
mean,	1
why	1
don't	1
the	1
French	1
police	1
take	1
this	1
up	1
if	1
it's	1
got	1
to	1
be	1
taken	1
up?	1
I	1
always	1
heard	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
spry	1
enough	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
way."	1
"Well,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
the	1
sergeant	1
reflectively,	1
"you	1
see,	1
sir,	1
the	1
French	1
police	1
don't	1
take	1
this	1
up--well,	1
because	1
you	1
see,	1
sir,	1
this	1
ain't	1
France.	1
This	1
is	1
His	1
Majesty's	1
dominions,	1
same	1
as	1
'Ampstead	1
'eath."	1
"Not	1
France?"	1
repeated	1
Turnbull,	1
with	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
dull	1
incredulity.	1
"No,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
the	1
sergeant;	1
"though	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
talk	1
French.	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
island	1
called	1
St.	1
Loup,	1
sir,	1
an	1
island	1
in	1
the	1
Channel.	1
We've	1
been	1
sent	1
down	1
specially	1
from	1
London,	1
as	1
you	1
were	1
such	1
specially	1
distinguished	1
criminals,	1
if	1
you'll	1
allow	1
me	1
to	1
say	1
so.	1
Which	1
reminds	1
me	1
to	1
warn	1
you	1
that	1
anything	1
you	1
say	1
may	1
be	1
used	1
against	1
you	1
at	1
your	1
trial."	1
"Quite	1
so,"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
and	1
lurched	1
suddenly	1
against	1
the	1
sergeant,	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
tip	1
him	1
over	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
road	1
with	1
a	1
crash	1
into	1
the	1
shingle	1
below.	1
Then	1
leaving	1
MacIan	1
and	1
the	1
policemen	1
equally	1
and	1
instantaneously	1
nailed	1
to	1
the	1
road,	1
he	1
ran	1
a	1
little	1
way	1
along	1
it,	1
leapt	1
off	1
on	1
to	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
beach,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
found	1
in	1
his	1
journey	1
to	1
be	1
firmer,	1
and	1
went	1
across	1
it	1
with	1
a	1
clatter	1
of	1
pebbles.	1
His	1
sudden	1
calculation	1
was	1
successful;	1
the	1
police,	1
unacquainted	1
with	1
the	1
various	1
levels	1
of	1
the	1
loose	1
beach,	1
tried	1
to	1
overtake	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
shorter	1
cut	1
and	1
found	1
themselves,	1
being	1
heavy	1
men,	1
almost	1
up	1
to	1
their	1
knees	1
in	1
shoals	1
of	1
slippery	1
shingle.	1
Two	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
slower	1
with	1
their	1
bodies	1
were	1
quicker	1
with	1
their	1
minds,	1
and	1
seeing	1
Turnbull's	1
trick,	1
ran	1
along	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
road	1
after	1
him.	1
Then	1
MacIan	1
finally	1
awoke,	1
and	1
leaving	1
half	1
his	1
sleeve	1
in	1
the	1
grip	1
of	1
the	1
only	1
man	1
who	1
tried	1
to	1
hold	1
him,	1
took	1
the	1
two	1
policemen	1
in	1
the	1
small	1
of	1
their	1
backs	1
with	1
the	1
impetus	1
of	1
a	1
cannon-ball	1
and,	1
sending	1
them	1
also	1
flat	1
among	1
the	1
stones,	1
went	1
tearing	1
after	1
his	1
twin	1
defier	1
of	1
the	1
law.	1
As	1
they	1
were	1
both	1
good	1
runners,	1
the	1
start	1
they	1
had	1
gained	1
was	1
decisive.	1
They	1
dropped	1
over	1
a	1
high	1
breakwater	1
farther	1
on	1
upon	1
the	1
beach,	1
turned	1
sharply,	1
and	1
scrambled	1
up	1
a	1
line	1
of	1
ribbed	1
rocks,	1
crowned	1
with	1
a	1
thicket,	1
crawled	1
through	1
it,	1
scratching	1
their	1
hands	1
and	1
faces,	1
and	1
dropped	1
into	1
another	1
road;	1
and	1
there	1
found	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
slacken	1
their	1
speed	1
into	1
a	1
steady	1
trot.	1
In	1
all	1
this	1
desperate	1
dart	1
and	1
scramble,	1
they	1
still	1
kept	1
hold	1
of	1
their	1
drawn	1
swords,	1
which	1
now,	1
indeed,	1
in	1
the	1
vigorous	1
phrase	1
of	1
Bunyan,	1
seemed	1
almost	1
to	1
grow	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
hands.	1
They	1
had	1
run	1
another	1
half	1
mile	1
or	1
so	1
when	1
it	1
became	1
apparent	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
entering	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
scattered	1
village.	1
One	1
or	1
two	1
whitewashed	1
cottages	1
and	1
even	1
a	1
shop	1
had	1
appeared	1
along	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
road.	1
Then,	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time,	1
Turnbull	1
twisted	1
round	1
his	1
red	1
bear	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
glimpse	1
of	1
his	1
companion,	1
who	1
was	1
a	1
foot	1
or	1
two	1
behind,	1
and	1
remarked	1
abruptly:	1
"Mr.	1
MacIan,	1
we've	1
been	1
going	1
the	1
wrong	1
way	1
to	1
work	1
all	1
along.	1
We're	1
traced	1
everywhere,	1
because	1
everybody	1
knows	1
about	1
us.	1
It's	1
as	1
if	1
one	1
went	1
about	1
with	1
Kruger's	1
beard	1
on	1
Mafeking	1
Night."	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
mean?"	1
said	1
MacIan,	1
innocently.	1
"I	1
mean,"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
with	1
steady	1
conviction,	1
"that	1
what	1
we	1
want	1
is	1
a	1
little	1
diplomacy,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
going	1
to	1
buy	1
some	1
in	1
a	1
shop."	1
XI.	1
A	1
SCANDAL	1
IN	1
THE	1
VILLAGE	1
In	1
the	1
little	1
hamlet	1
of	1
Haroc,	1
in	1
the	1
Isle	1
of	1
St.	1
Loup,	1
there	1
lived	1
a	1
man	1
who--though	1
living	1
under	1
the	1
English	1
flag--was	1
absolutely	1
untypical	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
tradition.	1
He	1
was	1
quite	1
unnoticeable,	1
but	1
that	1
was	1
exactly	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
quite	1
himself.	1
He	1
was	1
not	1
even	1
extraordinarily	1
French;	1
but	1
then	1
it	1
is	1
against	1
the	1
French	1
tradition	1
to	1
be	1
extraordinarily	1
French.	1
Ordinary	1
Englishmen	1
would	1
only	1
have	1
thought	1
him	1
a	1
little	1
old-fashioned;	1
imperialistic	1
Englishmen	1
would	1
really	1
have	1
mistaken	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
old	1
John	1
Bull	1
of	1
the	1
caricatures.	1
He	1
was	1
stout;	1
he	1
was	1
quite	1
undistinguished;	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
side-whiskers,	1
worn	1
just	1
a	1
little	1
longer	1
than	1
John	1
Bull's.	1
He	1
was	1
by	1
name	1
Pierre	1
Durand;	1
he	1
was	1
by	1
trade	1
a	1
wine	1
merchant;	1
he	1
was	1
by	1
politics	1
a	1
conservative	1
republican;	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
brought	1
up	1
a	1
Catholic,	1
had	1
always	1
thought	1
and	1
acted	1
as	1
an	1
agnostic,	1
and	1
was	1
very	1
mildly	1
returning	1
to	1
the	1
Church	1
in	1
his	1
later	1
years.	1
He	1
had	1
a	1
genius	1
(if	1
one	1
can	1
even	1
use	1
so	1
wild	1
a	1
word	1
in	1
connexion	1
with	1
so	1
tame	1
a	1
person)	1
a	1
genius	1
for	1
saying	1
the	1
conventional	1
thing	1
on	1
every	1
conceivable	1
subject;	1
or	1
rather	1
what	1
we	1
in	1
England	1
would	1
call	1
the	1
conventional	1
thing.	1
For	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
convention	1
with	1
him,	1
but	1
solid	1
and	1
manly	1
conviction.	1
Convention	1
implies	1
cant	1
or	1
affectation,	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
faintest	1
smell	1
of	1
either.	1
He	1
was	1
simply	1
an	1
ordinary	1
citizen	1
with	1
ordinary	1
views;	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
had	1
told	1
him	1
so	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
taken	1
it	1
as	1
an	1
ordinary	1
compliment.	1
If	1
you	1
had	1
asked	1
him	1
about	1
women,	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
said	1
that	1
one	1
must	1
preserve	1
their	1
domesticity	1
and	1
decorum;	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
used	1
the	1
stalest	1
words,	1
but	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
in	1
reserve	1
the	1
strongest	1
arguments.	1
If	1
you	1
had	1
asked	1
him	1
about	1
government,	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
said	1
that	1
all	1
citizens	1
were	1
free	1
and	1
equal,	1
but	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
meant	1
what	1
he	1
said.	1
If	1
you	1
had	1
asked	1
him	1
about	1
education,	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
said	1
that	1
the	1
young	1
must	1
be	1
trained	1
up	1
in	1
habits	1
of	1
industry	1
and	1
of	1
respect	1
for	1
their	1
parents.	1
Still	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
set	1
them	1
the	1
example	1
of	1
industry,	1
and	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
parents	1
whom	1
they	1
could	1
respect.	1
A	1
state	1
of	1
mind	1
so	1
hopelessly	1
central	1
is	1
depressing	1
to	1
the	1
English	1
instinct.	1
But	1
then	1
in	1
England	1
a	1
man	1
announcing	1
these	1
platitudes	1
is	1
generally	1
a	1
fool	1
and	1
a	1
frightened	1
fool,	1
announcing	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
mere	1
social	1
servility.	1
But	1
Durand	1
was	1
anything	1
but	1
a	1
fool;	1
he	1
had	1
read	1
all	1
the	1
eighteenth	1
century,	1
and	1
could	1
have	1
defended	1
his	1
platitudes	1
round	1
every	1
angle	1
of	1
eighteenth-century	1
argument.	1
And	1
certainly	1
he	1
was	1
anything	1
but	1
a	1
coward:	1
swollen	1
and	1
sedentary	1
as	1
he	1
was,	1
he	1
could	1
have	1
hit	1
any	1
man	1
back	1
who	1
touched	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
instant	1
violence	1
of	1
an	1
automatic	1
machine;	1
and	1
dying	1
in	1
a	1
uniform	1
would	1
have	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
only	1
the	1
sort	1
of	1
thing	1
that	1
sometimes	1
happens.	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
to	1
explain	1
this	1
monster	1
amid	1
the	1
exaggerative	1
sects	1
and	1
the	1
eccentric	1
clubs	1
of	1
my	1
country.	1
He	1
was	1
merely	1
a	1
man.	1
He	1
lived	1
in	1
a	1
little	1
villa	1
which	1
was	1
furnished	1
well	1
with	1
comfortable	1
chairs	1
and	1
tables	1
and	1
highly	1
uncomfortable	1
classical	1
pictures	1
and	1
medallions.	1
The	1
art	1
in	1
his	1
home	1
contained	1
nothing	1
between	1
the	1
two	1
extremes	1
of	1
hard,	1
meagre	1
designs	1
of	1
Greek	1
heads	1
and	1
Roman	1
togas,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
a	1
few	1
very	1
vulgar	1
Catholic	1
images	1
in	1
the	1
crudest	1
colours;	1
these	1
were	1
mostly	1
in	1
his	1
daughter's	1
room.	1
He	1
had	1
recently	1
lost	1
his	1
wife,	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
loved	1
heartily	1
and	1
rather	1
heavily	1
in	1
complete	1
silence,	1
and	1
upon	1
whose	1
grave	1
he	1
was	1
constantly	1
in	1
the	1
habit	1
of	1
placing	1
hideous	1
little	1
wreaths,	1
made	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
black-and-white	1
beads.	1
To	1
his	1
only	1
daughter	1
he	1
was	1
equally	1
devoted,	1
though	1
he	1
restricted	1
her	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
under	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
theoretic	1
alarm	1
about	1
her	1
innocence;	1
an	1
alarm	1
which	1
was	1
peculiarly	1
unnecessary,	1
first,	1
because	1
she	1
was	1
an	1
exceptionally	1
reticent	1
and	1
religious	1
girl,	1
and	1
secondly,	1
because	1
there	1
was	1
hardly	1
anybody	1
else	1
in	1
the	1
place.	1
Madeleine	1
Durand	1
was	1
physically	1
a	1
sleepy	1
young	1
woman,	1
and	1
might	1
easily	1
have	1
been	1
supposed	1
to	1
be	1
morally	1
a	1
lazy	1
one.	1
It	1
is,	1
however,	1
certain	1
that	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
her	1
house	1
was	1
done	1
somehow,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
even	1
more	1
rapidly	1
ascertainable	1
that	1
nobody	1
else	1
did	1
it.	1
The	1
logician	1
is,	1
therefore,	1
driven	1
back	1
upon	1
the	1
assumption	1
that	1
she	1
did	1
it;	1
and	1
that	1
lends	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
mysterious	1
interest	1
to	1
her	1
personality	1
at	1
the	1
beginning.	1
She	1
had	1
very	1
broad,	1
low,	1
and	1
level	1
brows,	1
which	1
seemed	1
even	1
lower	1
because	1
her	1
warm	1
yellow	1
hair	1
clustered	1
down	1
to	1
her	1
eyebrows;	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
a	1
face	1
just	1
plump	1
enough	1
not	1
to	1
look	1
as	1
powerful	1
as	1
it	1
was.	1
Anything	1
that	1
was	1
heavy	1
in	1
all	1
this	1
was	1
abruptly	1
lightened	1
by	1
two	1
large,	1
light	1
china-blue	1
eyes,	1
lightened	1
all	1
of	1
a	1
sudden	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
lifted	1
into	1
the	1
air	1
by	1
two	1
big	1
blue	1
butterflies.	1
The	1
rest	1
of	1
her	1
was	1
less	1
than	1
middle-sized,	1
and	1
was	1
of	1
a	1
casual	1
and	1
comfortable	1
sort;	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
this	1
difference	1
from	1
such	1
girls	1
as	1
the	1
girl	1
in	1
the	1
motor-car,	1
that	1
one	1
did	1
not	1
incline	1
to	1
take	1
in	1
her	1
figure	1
at	1
all,	1
but	1
only	1
her	1
broad	1
and	1
leonine	1
and	1
innocent	1
head.	1
Both	1
the	1
father	1
and	1
the	1
daughter	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
sort	1
that	1
would	1
normally	1
have	1
avoided	1
all	1
observation;	1
that	1
is,	1
all	1
observation	1
in	1
that	1
extraordinary	1
modern	1
world	1
which	1
calls	1
out	1
everything	1
except	1
strength.	1
Both	1
of	1
them	1
had	1
strength	1
below	1
the	1
surface;	1
they	1
were	1
like	1
quiet	1
peasants	1
owning	1
enormous	1
and	1
unquarried	1
mines.	1
The	1
father	1
with	1
his	1
square	1
face	1
and	1
grey	1
side	1
whiskers,	1
the	1
daughter	1
with	1
her	1
square	1
face	1
and	1
golden	1
fringe	1
of	1
hair,	1
were	1
both	1
stronger	1
than	1
they	1
know;	1
stronger	1
than	1
anyone	1
knew.	1
The	1
father	1
believed	1
in	1
civilization,	1
in	1
the	1
storied	1
tower	1
we	1
have	1
erected	1
to	1
affront	1
nature;	1
that	1
is,	1
the	1
father	1
believed	1
in	1
Man.	1
The	1
daughter	1
believed	1
in	1
God;	1
and	1
was	1
even	1
stronger.	1
They	1
neither	1
of	1
them	1
believed	1
in	1
themselves;	1
for	1
that	1
is	1
a	1
decadent	1
weakness.	1
The	1
daughter	1
was	1
called	1
a	1
devotee.	1
She	1
left	1
upon	1
ordinary	1
people	1
the	1
impression--the	1
somewhat	1
irritating	1
impression--produced	1
by	1
such	1
a	1
person;	1
it	1
can	1
only	1
be	1
described	1
as	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
strong	1
water	1
being	1
perpetually	1
poured	1
into	1
some	1
abyss.	1
She	1
did	1
her	1
housework	1
easily;	1
she	1
achieved	1
her	1
social	1
relations	1
sweetly;	1
she	1
was	1
never	1
neglectful	1
and	1
never	1
unkind.	1
This	1
accounted	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
soft	1
in	1
her,	1
but	1
not	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
hard.	1
She	1
trod	1
firmly	1
as	1
if	1
going	1
somewhere;	1
she	1
flung	1
her	1
face	1
back	1
as	1
if	1
defying	1
something;	1
she	1
hardly	1
spoke	1
a	1
cross	1
word,	1
yet	1
there	1
was	1
often	1
battle	1
in	1
her	1
eyes.	1
The	1
modern	1
man	1
asked	1
doubtfully	1
where	1
all	1
this	1
silent	1
energy	1
went	1
to.	1
He	1
would	1
have	1
stared	1
still	1
more	1
doubtfully	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
told	1
that	1
it	1
all	1
went	1
into	1
her	1
prayers.	1
The	1
conventions	1
of	1
the	1
Isle	1
of	1
St.	1
Loup	1
were	1
necessarily	1
a	1
compromise	1
or	1
confusion	1
between	1
those	1
of	1
France	1
and	1
England;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
vaguely	1
possible	1
for	1
a	1
respectable	1
young	1
lady	1
to	1
have	1
half-attached	1
lovers,	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
impossible	1
to	1
the	1
_bourgeoisie_	1
of	1
France.	1
One	1
man	1
in	1
particular	1
had	1
made	1
himself	1
an	1
unmistakable	1
figure	1
in	1
the	1
track	1
of	1
this	1
girl	1
as	1
she	1
went	1
to	1
church.	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
short,	1
prosperous-looking	1
man,	1
whose	1
long,	1
bushy	1
black	1
beard	1
and	1
clumsy	1
black	1
umbrella	1
made	1
him	1
seem	1
both	1
shorter	1
and	1
older	1
than	1
he	1
really	1
was;	1
but	1
whose	1
big,	1
bold	1
eyes,	1
and	1
step	1
that	1
spurned	1
the	1
ground,	1
gave	1
him	1
an	1
instant	1
character	1
of	1
youth.	1
His	1
name	1
was	1
Camille	1
Bert,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
commercial	1
traveller	1
who	1
had	1
only	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
island	1
an	1
idle	1
week	1
before	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
hover	1
in	1
the	1
tracks	1
of	1
Madeleine	1
Durand.	1
Since	1
everyone	1
knows	1
everyone	1
in	1
so	1
small	1
a	1
place,	1
Madeleine	1
certainly	1
knew	1
him	1
to	1
speak	1
to;	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
very	1
evident	1
that	1
she	1
ever	1
spoke.	1
He	1
haunted	1
her,	1
however;	1
especially	1
at	1
church,	1
which	1
was,	1
indeed,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
few	1
certain	1
places	1
for	1
finding	1
her.	1
In	1
her	1
home	1
she	1
had	1
a	1
habit	1
of	1
being	1
invisible,	1
sometimes	1
through	1
insatiable	1
domesticity,	1
sometimes	1
through	1
an	1
equally	1
insatiable	1
solitude.	1
M.	1
Bert	1
did	1
not	1
give	1
the	1
impression	1
of	1
a	1
pious	1
man,	1
though	1
he	1
did	1
give,	1
especially	1
with	1
his	1
eyes,	1
the	1
impression	1
of	1
an	1
honest	1
one.	1
But	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
Mass	1
with	1
a	1
simple	1
exactitude	1
that	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
mistaken	1
for	1
a	1
pose,	1
or	1
even	1
for	1
a	1
vulgar	1
fascination.	1
It	1
was	1
perhaps	1
this	1
religious	1
regularity	1
which	1
eventually	1
drew	1
Madeleine	1
into	1
recognition	1
of	1
him.	1
At	1
least	1
it	1
is	1
certain	1
that	1
she	1
twice	1
spoke	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
her	1
square	1
and	1
open	1
smile	1
in	1
the	1
porch	1
of	1
the	1
church;	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
human	1
nature	1
enough	1
in	1
the	1
hamlet	1
to	1
turn	1
even	1
that	1
into	1
gossip.	1
But	1
the	1
real	1
interest	1
arose	1
suddenly	1
as	1
a	1
squall	1
arises	1
with	1
the	1
extraordinary	1
affair	1
that	1
occurred	1
about	1
five	1
days	1
after.	1
There	1
was	1
about	1
a	1
third	1
of	1
a	1
mile	1
beyond	1
the	1
village	1
of	1
Haroc	1
a	1
large	1
but	1
lonely	1
hotel	1
upon	1
the	1
London	1
or	1
Paris	1
model,	1
but	1
commonly	1
almost	1
entirely	1
empty.	1
Among	1
the	1
accidental	1
group	1
of	1
guests	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
it	1
at	1
this	1
season	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
whose	1
nationality	1
no	1
one	1
could	1
fix	1
and	1
who	1
bore	1
the	1
non-committal	1
name	1
of	1
Count	1
Gregory.	1
He	1
treated	1
everybody	1
with	1
complete	1
civility	1
and	1
almost	1
in	1
complete	1
silence.	1
On	1
the	1
few	1
occasions	1
when	1
he	1
spoke,	1
he	1
spoke	1
either	1
French,	1
English,	1
or	1
once	1
(to	1
the	1
priest)	1
Latin;	1
and	1
the	1
general	1
opinion	1
was	1
that	1
he	1
spoke	1
them	1
all	1
wrong.	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
large,	1
lean	1
man,	1
with	1
the	1
stoop	1
of	1
an	1
aged	1
eagle,	1
and	1
even	1
the	1
eagle's	1
nose	1
to	1
complete	1
it;	1
he	1
had	1
old-fashioned	1
military	1
whiskers	1
and	1
moustache	1
dyed	1
with	1
a	1
garish	1
and	1
highly	1
incredible	1
yellow.	1
He	1
had	1
the	1
dress	1
of	1
a	1
showy	1
gentleman	1
and	1
the	1
manners	1
of	1
a	1
decayed	1
gentleman;	1
he	1
seemed	1
(as	1
with	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
simplicity)	1
to	1
be	1
trying	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
dandy	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
too	1
old	1
even	1
to	1
know	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
old.	1
Ye	1
he	1
was	1
decidedly	1
a	1
handsome	1
figure	1
with	1
his	1
curled	1
yellow	1
hair	1
and	1
lean	1
fastidious	1
face;	1
and	1
he	1
wore	1
a	1
peculiar	1
frock-coat	1
of	1
bright	1
turquoise	1
blue,	1
with	1
an	1
unknown	1
order	1
pinned	1
to	1
it,	1
and	1
he	1
carried	1
a	1
huge	1
and	1
heavy	1
cane.	1
Despite	1
his	1
silence	1
and	1
his	1
dandified	1
dress	1
and	1
whiskers,	1
the	1
island	1
might	1
never	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
him	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
extraordinary	1
event	1
of	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
spoken,	1
which	1
fell	1
about	1
in	1
the	1
following	1
way:	1
In	1
such	1
casual	1
atmospheres	1
only	1
the	1
enthusiastic	1
go	1
to	1
Benediction;	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
warm	1
blue	1
twilight	1
closed	1
over	1
the	1
little	1
candle-lit	1
church	1
and	1
village,	1
the	1
line	1
of	1
worshippers	1
who	1
went	1
home	1
from	1
the	1
former	1
to	1
the	1
latter	1
thinned	1
out	1
until	1
it	1
broke.	1
On	1
one	1
such	1
evening	1
at	1
least	1
no	1
one	1
was	1
in	1
church	1
except	1
the	1
quiet,	1
unconquerable	1
Madeleine,	1
four	1
old	1
women,	1
one	1
fisherman,	1
and,	1
of	1
course,	1
the	1
irrepressible	1
M.	1
Camille	1
Bert.	1
The	1
others	1
seemed	1
to	1
melt	1
away	1
afterwards	1
into	1
the	1
peacock	1
colours	1
of	1
the	1
dim	1
green	1
grass	1
and	1
the	1
dark	1
blue	1
sky.	1
Even	1
Durand	1
was	1
invisible	1
instead	1
of	1
being	1
merely	1
reverentially	1
remote;	1
and	1
Madeleine	1
set	1
forth	1
through	1
the	1
patch	1
of	1
black	1
forest	1
alone.	1
She	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
afraid	1
of	1
loneliness,	1
because	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
afraid	1
of	1
devils.	1
I	1
think	1
they	1
were	1
afraid	1
of	1
her.	1
In	1
a	1
clearing	1
of	1
the	1
wood,	1
however,	1
which	1
was	1
lit	1
up	1
with	1
a	1
last	1
patch	1
of	1
the	1
perishing	1
sunlight,	1
there	1
advanced	1
upon	1
her	1
suddenly	1
one	1
who	1
was	1
more	1
startling	1
than	1
a	1
devil.	1
The	1
incomprehensible	1
Count	1
Gregory,	1
with	1
his	1
yellow	1
hair	1
like	1
flame	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
like	1
the	1
white	1
ashes	1
of	1
the	1
flame,	1
was	1
advancing	1
bareheaded	1
towards	1
her,	1
flinging	1
out	1
his	1
arms	1
and	1
his	1
long	1
fingers	1
with	1
a	1
frantic	1
gesture.	1
"We	1
are	1
alone	1
here,"	1
he	1
cried,	1
"and	1
you	1
would	1
be	1
at	1
my	1
mercy,	1
only	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
at	1
yours."	1
Then	1
his	1
frantic	1
hands	1
fell	1
by	1
his	1
sides	1
and	1
he	1
looked	1
up	1
under	1
his	1
brows	1
with	1
an	1
expression	1
that	1
went	1
well	1
with	1
his	1
hard	1
breathing.	1
Madeleine	1
Durand	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
a	1
halt	1
at	1
first	1
in	1
childish	1
wonder,	1
and	1
now,	1
with	1
more	1
than	1
masculine	1
self-control,	1
"I	1
fancy	1
I	1
know	1
your	1
face,	1
sir,"	1
she	1
said,	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
gain	1
time.	1
"I	1
know	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
forget	1
yours,"	1
said	1
the	1
other,	1
and	1
extended	1
once	1
more	1
his	1
ungainly	1
arms	1
in	1
an	1
unnatural	1
gesture.	1
Then	1
of	1
a	1
sudden	1
there	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
him	1
a	1
spout	1
of	1
wild	1
and	1
yet	1
pompous	1
phrases.	1
"It	1
is	1
as	1
well	1
that	1
you	1
should	1
know	1
the	1
worst	1
and	1
the	1
best.	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
knows	1
no	1
limit;	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
most	1
callous	1
of	1
criminals,	1
the	1
most	1
unrepentant	1
of	1
sinners.	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
man	1
in	1
my	1
dominions	1
so	1
vile	1
as	1
I.	1
But	1
my	1
dominions	1
stretch	1
from	1
the	1
olives	1
of	1
Italy	1
to	1
the	1
fir-woods	1
of	1
Denmark,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
nook	1
of	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
in	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
done	1
a	1
sin.	1
But	1
when	1
I	1
bear	1
you	1
away	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
doing	1
my	1
first	1
sacrilege,	1
and	1
also	1
my	1
first	1
act	1
of	1
virtue."	1
He	1
seized	1
her	1
suddenly	1
by	1
the	1
elbow;	1
and	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
scream	1
but	1
only	1
pulled	1
and	1
tugged.	1
Yet	1
though	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
screamed,	1
someone	1
astray	1
in	1
the	1
woods	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
heard	1
the	1
struggle.	1
A	1
short	1
but	1
nimble	1
figure	1
came	1
along	1
the	1
woodland	1
path	1
like	1
a	1
humming	1
bullet	1
and	1
had	1
caught	1
Count	1
Gregory	1
a	1
crack	1
across	1
the	1
face	1
before	1
his	1
own	1
could	1
be	1
recognized.	1
When	1
it	1
was	1
recognized	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
of	1
Camille,	1
with	1
the	1
black	1
elderly	1
beard	1
and	1
the	1
young	1
ardent	1
eyes.	1
Up	1
to	1
the	1
moment	1
when	1
Camille	1
had	1
hit	1
the	1
Count,	1
Madeleine	1
had	1
entertained	1
no	1
doubt	1
that	1
the	1
Count	1
was	1
merely	1
a	1
madman.	1
Now	1
she	1
was	1
startled	1
with	1
a	1
new	1
sanity;	1
for	1
the	1
tall	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
yellow	1
whiskers	1
and	1
yellow	1
moustache	1
first	1
returned	1
the	1
blow	1
of	1
Bert,	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
duty,	1
and	1
then	1
stepped	1
back	1
with	1
a	1
slight	1
bow	1
and	1
an	1
easy	1
smile.	1
"This	1
need	1
go	1
no	1
further	1
here,	1
M.	1
Bert,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"I	1
need	1
not	1
remind	1
you	1
how	1
far	1
it	1
should	1
go	1
elsewhere."	1
"Certainly,	1
you	1
need	1
remind	1
me	1
of	1
nothing,"	1
answered	1
Camille,	1
stolidly.	1
"I	1
am	1
glad	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
just	1
not	1
too	1
much	1
of	1
a	1
scoundrel	1
for	1
a	1
gentleman	1
to	1
fight."	1
"We	1
are	1
detaining	1
the	1
lady,"	1
said	1
Count	1
Gregory,	1
with	1
politeness;	1
and,	1
making	1
a	1
gesture	1
suggesting	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
taken	1
off	1
his	1
hat	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
had	1
one,	1
he	1
strode	1
away	1
up	1
the	1
avenue	1
of	1
trees	1
and	1
eventually	1
disappeared.	1
He	1
was	1
so	1
complete	1
an	1
aristocrat	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
offer	1
his	1
back	1
to	1
them	1
all	1
the	1
way	1
up	1
that	1
avenue;	1
and	1
his	1
back	1
never	1
once	1
looked	1
uncomfortable.	1
"You	1
must	1
allow	1
me	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
home,"	1
said	1
Bert	1
to	1
the	1
girl,	1
in	1
a	1
gruff	1
and	1
almost	1
stifled	1
voice;	1
"I	1
think	1
we	1
have	1
only	1
a	1
little	1
way	1
to	1
go."	1
"Only	1
a	1
little	1
way,"	1
she	1
said,	1
and	1
smiled	1
once	1
more	1
that	1
night,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
fatigue	1
and	1
fear	1
and	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
the	1
flesh	1
and	1
the	1
devil.	1
The	1
glowing	1
and	1
transparent	1
blue	1
of	1
twilight	1
had	1
long	1
been	1
covered	1
by	1
the	1
opaque	1
and	1
slatelike	1
blue	1
of	1
night,	1
when	1
he	1
handed	1
her	1
into	1
the	1
lamp-lit	1
interior	1
of	1
her	1
home.	1
He	1
went	1
out	1
himself	1
into	1
the	1
darkness,	1
walking	1
sturdily,	1
but	1
tearing	1
at	1
his	1
black	1
beard.	1
All	1
the	1
French	1
or	1
semi-French	1
gentry	1
of	1
the	1
district	1
considered	1
this	1
a	1
case	1
in	1
which	1
a	1
duel	1
was	1
natural	1
and	1
inevitable,	1
and	1
neither	1
party	1
had	1
any	1
difficulty	1
in	1
finding	1
seconds,	1
strangers	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
place.	1
Two	1
small	1
landowners,	1
who	1
were	1
careful,	1
practising	1
Catholics,	1
willingly	1
undertook	1
to	1
represent	1
that	1
strict	1
church-goer	1
Camille	1
Burt;	1
while	1
the	1
profligate	1
but	1
apparently	1
powerful	1
Count	1
Gregory	1
found	1
friends	1
in	1
an	1
energetic	1
local	1
doctor	1
who	1
was	1
ready	1
for	1
social	1
promotion	1
and	1
an	1
accidental	1
Californian	1
tourist	1
who	1
was	1
ready	1
for	1
anything.	1
As	1
no	1
particular	1
purpose	1
could	1
be	1
served	1
by	1
delay,	1
it	1
was	1
arranged	1
that	1
the	1
affair	1
should	1
fall	1
out	1
three	1
days	1
afterwards.	1
And	1
when	1
this	1
was	1
settled	1
the	1
whole	1
community,	1
as	1
it	1
were,	1
turned	1
over	1
again	1
in	1
bed	1
and	1
thought	1
no	1
more	1
about	1
the	1
matter.	1
At	1
least	1
there	1
was	1
only	1
one	1
member	1
of	1
it	1
who	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
restless,	1
and	1
that	1
was	1
she	1
who	1
was	1
commonly	1
most	1
restful.	1
On	1
the	1
next	1
night	1
Madeleine	1
Durand	1
went	1
to	1
church	1
as	1
usual;	1
and	1
as	1
usual	1
the	1
stricken	1
Camille	1
was	1
there	1
also.	1
What	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
usual	1
was	1
that	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
a	1
bow-shot	1
from	1
the	1
church	1
Madeleine	1
turned	1
round	1
and	1
walked	1
back	1
to	1
him.	1
"Sir,"	1
she	1
began,	1
"it	1
is	1
not	1
wrong	1
of	1
me	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
you,"	1
and	1
the	1
very	1
words	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
jar	1
of	1
unexpected	1
truth;	1
for	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
novels	1
he	1
had	1
ever	1
read	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
begun:	1
"It	1
is	1
wrong	1
of	1
me	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
you."	1
She	1
went	1
on	1
with	1
wide	1
and	1
serious	1
eyes	1
like	1
an	1
animal's:	1
"It	1
is	1
not	1
wrong	1
of	1
me	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
you,	1
because	1
your	1
soul,	1
or	1
anybody's	1
soul,	1
matters	1
so	1
much	1
more	1
than	1
what	1
the	1
world	1
says	1
about	1
anybody.	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
you	1
about	1
what	1
you	1
are	1
going	1
to	1
do."	1
Bert	1
saw	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
him	1
the	1
inevitable	1
heroine	1
of	1
the	1
novels	1
trying	1
to	1
prevent	1
bloodshed;	1
and	1
his	1
pale	1
firm	1
face	1
became	1
implacable.	1
"I	1
would	1
do	1
anything	1
but	1
that	1
for	1
you,"	1
he	1
said;	1
"but	1
no	1
man	1
can	1
be	1
called	1
less	1
than	1
a	1
man."	1
She	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
with	1
a	1
face	1
openly	1
puzzled,	1
and	1
then	1
broke	1
into	1
an	1
odd	1
and	1
beautiful	1
half-smile.	1
"Oh,	1
I	1
don't	1
mean	1
that,"	1
she	1
said;	1
"I	1
don't	1
talk	1
about	1
what	1
I	1
don't	1
understand.	1
No	1
one	1
has	1
ever	1
hit	1
me;	1
and	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
feel	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
may.	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
best	1
thing	1
to	1
fight.	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
better	1
to	1
forgive--if	1
one	1
could	1
really	1
forgive.	1
But	1
when	1
people	1
dine	1
with	1
my	1
father	1
and	1
say	1
that	1
fighting	1
a	1
duel	1
is	1
mere	1
murder--of	1
course	1
I	1
can	1
see	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
just.	1
It's	1
all	1
so	1
different--having	1
a	1
reason--and	1
letting	1
the	1
other	1
man	1
know--and	1
using	1
the	1
same	1
guns	1
and	1
things--and	1
doing	1
it	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
your	1
friends.	1
I'm	1
awfully	1
stupid,	1
but	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
men	1
like	1
you	1
aren't	1
murderers.	1
But	1
it	1
wasn't	1
that	1
that	1
I	1
meant."	1
"What	1
did	1
you	1
mean?"	1
asked	1
the	1
other,	1
looking	1
broodingly	1
at	1
the	1
earth.	1
"Don't	1
you	1
know,"	1
she	1
said,	1
"there	1
is	1
only	1
one	1
more	1
celebration?	1
I	1
thought	1
that	1
as	1
you	1
always	1
go	1
to	1
church--I	1
thought	1
you	1
would	1
communicate	1
this	1
morning."	1
Bert	1
stepped	1
backward	1
with	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
action	1
she	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
in	1
him	1
before.	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
alter	1
his	1
whole	1
body.	1
"You	1
may	1
be	1
right	1
or	1
wrong	1
to	1
risk	1
dying,"	1
said	1
the	1
girl,	1
simply;	1
"the	1
poor	1
women	1
in	1
our	1
village	1
risk	1
it	1
whenever	1
they	1
have	1
a	1
baby.	1
You	1
men	1
are	1
the	1
other	1
half	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
I	1
know	1
nothing	1
about	1
when	1
you	1
ought	1
to	1
die.	1
But	1
surely	1
if	1
you	1
are	1
daring	1
to	1
try	1
and	1
find	1
God	1
beyond	1
the	1
grave	1
and	1
appeal	1
to	1
Him--you	1
ought	1
to	1
let	1
Him	1
find	1
you	1
when	1
He	1
comes	1
and	1
stands	1
there	1
every	1
morning	1
in	1
our	1
little	1
church."	1
And	1
placid	1
as	1
she	1
was,	1
she	1
made	1
a	1
little	1
gesture	1
of	1
argument,	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
pathos	1
wrung	1
the	1
heart.	1
M.	1
Camille	1
Bert	1
was	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
placid.	1
Before	1
that	1
incomplete	1
gesture	1
and	1
frankly	1
pleading	1
face	1
he	1
retreated	1
as	1
if	1
from	1
the	1
jaws	1
of	1
a	1
dragon.	1
His	1
dark	1
black	1
hair	1
and	1
beard	1
looked	1
utterly	1
unnatural	1
against	1
the	1
startling	1
pallor	1
of	1
his	1
face.	1
When	1
at	1
last	1
he	1
said	1
something	1
it	1
was:	1
"O	1
God!	1
I	1
can't	1
stand	1
this!"	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
say	1
it	1
in	1
French.	1
Nor	1
did	1
he,	1
strictly	1
speaking,	1
say	1
it	1
in	1
English.	1
The	1
truth	1
(interesting	1
only	1
to	1
anthropologists)	1
is	1
that	1
he	1
said	1
it	1
in	1
Scotch.	1
"There	1
will	1
be	1
another	1
mass	1
in	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
eight	1
hours,"	1
said	1
Madeleine,	1
with	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
business	1
eagerness	1
and	1
energy,	1
"and	1
you	1
can	1
do	1
it	1
then	1
before	1
the	1
fighting.	1
You	1
must	1
forgive	1
me,	1
but	1
I	1
was	1
so	1
frightened	1
that	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
do	1
it	1
at	1
all."	1
Bert	1
seemed	1
to	1
crush	1
his	1
teeth	1
together	1
until	1
they	1
broke,	1
and	1
managed	1
to	1
say	1
between	1
them:	1
"And	1
why	1
should	1
you	1
suppose	1
that	1
I	1
shouldn't	1
do	1
as	1
you	1
say--I	1
mean	1
not	1
to	1
do	1
it	1
at	1
all?"	1
"You	1
always	1
go	1
to	1
Mass,"	1
answered	1
the	1
girl,	1
opening	1
her	1
wide	1
blue	1
eyes,	1
"and	1
the	1
Mass	1
is	1
very	1
long	1
and	1
tiresome	1
unless	1
one	1
loves	1
God."	1
Then	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
Bert	1
exploded	1
with	1
a	1
brutality	1
which	1
might	1
have	1
come	1
from	1
Count	1
Gregory,	1
his	1
criminal	1
opponent.	1
He	1
advanced	1
upon	1
Madeleine	1
with	1
flaming	1
eyes,	1
and	1
almost	1
took	1
her	1
by	1
the	1
two	1
shoulders.	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
love	1
God,"	1
he	1
cried,	1
speaking	1
French	1
with	1
the	1
broadest	1
Scotch	1
accent;	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
find	1
Him;	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
He	1
is	1
there	1
to	1
be	1
found.	1
I	1
must	1
burst	1
up	1
the	1
show;	1
I	1
must	1
and	1
will	1
say	1
everything.	1
You	1
are	1
the	1
happiest	1
and	1
honestest	1
thing	1
I	1
ever	1
saw	1
in	1
this	1
godless	1
universe.	1
And	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
dirtiest	1
and	1
most	1
dishonest."	1
Madeleine	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
doubtfully	1
for	1
an	1
instant,	1
and	1
then	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
sudden	1
simplicity	1
and	1
cheerfulness:	1
"Oh,	1
but	1
if	1
you	1
are	1
really	1
sorry	1
it	1
is	1
all	1
right.	1
If	1
you	1
are	1
horribly	1
sorry	1
it	1
is	1
all	1
the	1
better.	1
You	1
have	1
only	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
tell	1
the	1
priest	1
so	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
give	1
you	1
God	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
hands."	1
"I	1
hate	1
your	1
priest	1
and	1
I	1
deny	1
your	1
God!"	1
cried	1
the	1
man,	1
"and	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
God	1
is	1
a	1
lie	1
and	1
a	1
fable	1
and	1
a	1
mask.	1
And	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
in	1
my	1
life	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
feel	1
superior	1
to	1
God."	1
"What	1
can	1
it	1
all	1
mean?"	1
said	1
Madeleine,	1
in	1
massive	1
wonder.	1
"Because	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
fable	1
also	1
and	1
a	1
mask,"	1
said	1
the	1
man.	1
He	1
had	1
been	1
plucking	1
fiercely	1
at	1
his	1
black	1
beard	1
and	1
hair	1
all	1
the	1
time;	1
now	1
he	1
suddenly	1
plucked	1
them	1
off	1
and	1
flung	1
them	1
like	1
moulted	1
feathers	1
in	1
the	1
mire.	1
This	1
extraordinary	1
spoliation	1
left	1
in	1
the	1
sunlight	1
the	1
same	1
face,	1
but	1
a	1
much	1
younger	1
head--a	1
head	1
with	1
close	1
chestnut	1
curls	1
and	1
a	1
short	1
chestnut	1
beard.	1
"Now	1
you	1
know	1
the	1
truth,"	1
he	1
answered,	1
with	1
hard	1
eyes.	1
"I	1
am	1
a	1
cad	1
who	1
has	1
played	1
a	1
crooked	1
trick	1
on	1
a	1
quiet	1
village	1
and	1
a	1
decent	1
woman	1
for	1
a	1
private	1
reason	1
of	1
his	1
own.	1
I	1
might	1
have	1
played	1
it	1
successfully	1
on	1
any	1
other	1
woman;	1
I	1
have	1
hit	1
the	1
one	1
woman	1
on	1
whom	1
it	1
cannot	1
be	1
played.	1
It's	1
just	1
like	1
my	1
damned	1
luck.	1
The	1
plain	1
truth	1
is,"	1
and	1
here	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
plain	1
truth	1
he	1
boggled	1
and	1
blundered	1
as	1
Evan	1
had	1
done	1
in	1
telling	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
girl	1
in	1
the	1
motor-car.	1
"The	1
plain	1
truth	1
is,"	1
he	1
said	1
at	1
last,	1
"that	1
I	1
am	1
James	1
Turnbull	1
the	1
atheist.	1
The	1
police	1
are	1
after	1
me;	1
not	1
for	1
atheism	1
but	1
for	1
being	1
ready	1
to	1
fight	1
for	1
it."	1
"I	1
saw	1
something	1
about	1
you	1
in	1
a	1
newspaper,"	1
said	1
the	1
girl,	1
with	1
a	1
simplicity	1
which	1
even	1
surprise	1
could	1
never	1
throw	1
off	1
its	1
balance.	1
"Evan	1
MacIan	1
said	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
God,"	1
went	1
on	1
the	1
other,	1
stubbornly,	1
"and	1
I	1
say	1
there	1
isn't.	1
And	1
I	1
have	1
come	1
to	1
fight	1
for	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
God;	1
it	1
is	1
for	1
that	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
this	1
cursed	1
island	1
and	1
your	1
blessed	1
face."	1
"You	1
want	1
me	1
really	1
to	1
believe,"	1
said	1
Madeleine,	1
with	1
parted	1
lips,	1
"that	1
you	1
think----"	1
"I	1
want	1
you	1
to	1
hate	1
me!"	1
cried	1
Turnbull,	1
in	1
agony.	1
"I	1
want	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
sick	1
when	1
you	1
think	1
of	1
my	1
name.	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
God."	1
"But	1
there	1
is,"	1
said	1
Madeleine,	1
quite	1
quietly,	1
and	1
rather	1
with	1
the	1
air	1
of	1
one	1
telling	1
children	1
about	1
an	1
elephant.	1
"Why,	1
I	1
touched	1
His	1
body	1
only	1
this	1
morning."	1
"You	1
touched	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
bread,"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
biting	1
his	1
knuckles.	1
"Oh,	1
I	1
will	1
say	1
anything	1
that	1
can	1
madden	1
you!"	1
"You	1
think	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
bread,"	1
said	1
the	1
girl,	1
and	1
her	1
lips	1
tightened	1
ever	1
so	1
little.	1
"I	1
know	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
bread,"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
with	1
violence.	1
She	1
flung	1
back	1
her	1
open	1
face	1
and	1
smiled.	1
"Then	1
why	1
did	1
you	1
refuse	1
to	1
eat	1
it?"	1
she	1
said.	1
James	1
Turnbull	1
made	1
a	1
little	1
step	1
backward,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
in	1
his	1
life	1
there	1
seemed	1
to	1
break	1
out	1
and	1
blaze	1
in	1
his	1
head	1
thoughts	1
that	1
were	1
not	1
his	1
own.	1
"Why,	1
how	1
silly	1
of	1
them,"	1
cried	1
out	1
Madeleine,	1
with	1
quite	1
a	1
schoolgirl	1
gaiety,	1
"why,	1
how	1
silly	1
of	1
them	1
to	1
call	1
_you_	1
a	1
blasphemer!	1
Why,	1
you	1
have	1
wrecked	1
your	1
whole	1
business	1
because	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
commit	1
blasphemy."	1
The	1
man	1
stood,	1
a	1
somewhat	1
comic	1
figure	1
in	1
his	1
tragic	1
bewilderment,	1
with	1
the	1
honest	1
red	1
head	1
of	1
James	1
Turnbull	1
sticking	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
rich	1
and	1
fictitious	1
garments	1
of	1
Camille	1
Bert.	1
But	1
the	1
startled	1
pain	1
of	1
his	1
face	1
was	1
strong	1
enough	1
to	1
obliterate	1
the	1
oddity.	1
"You	1
come	1
down	1
here,"	1
continued	1
the	1
lady,	1
with	1
that	1
female	1
emphasis	1
which	1
is	1
so	1
pulverizing	1
in	1
conversation	1
and	1
so	1
feeble	1
at	1
a	1
public	1
meeting,	1
"you	1
and	1
your	1
MacIan	1
come	1
down	1
here	1
and	1
put	1
on	1
false	1
beards	1
or	1
noses	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
fight.	1
You	1
pretend	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
Catholic	1
commercial	1
traveller	1
from	1
France.	1
Poor	1
Mr.	1
MacIan	1
has	1
to	1
pretend	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
dissolute	1
nobleman	1
from	1
nowhere.	1
Your	1
scheme	1
succeeds;	1
you	1
pick	1
a	1
quite	1
convincing	1
quarrel;	1
you	1
arrange	1
a	1
quite	1
respectable	1
duel;	1
the	1
duel	1
you	1
have	1
planned	1
so	1
long	1
will	1
come	1
off	1
tomorrow	1
with	1
absolute	1
certainty	1
and	1
safety.	1
And	1
then	1
you	1
throw	1
off	1
your	1
wig	1
and	1
throw	1
up	1
your	1
scheme	1
and	1
throw	1
over	1
your	1
colleague,	1
because	1
I	1
ask	1
you	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
a	1
building	1
and	1
eat	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
bread.	1
And	1
_then_	1
you	1
dare	1
to	1
tell	1
me	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
sure	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
watching	1
us.	1
Then	1
you	1
say	1
you	1
know	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
on	1
the	1
very	1
altar	1
you	1
run	1
away	1
from.	1
You	1
know----"	1
"I	1
only	1
know,"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
"that	1
I	1
must	1
run	1
away	1
from	1
you.	1
This	1
has	1
got	1
beyond	1
any	1
talking."	1
And	1
he	1
plunged	1
along	1
into	1
the	1
village,	1
leaving	1
his	1
black	1
wig	1
and	1
beard	1
lying	1
behind	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
road.	1
As	1
the	1
market-place	1
opened	1
before	1
him	1
he	1
saw	1
Count	1
Gregory,	1
that	1
distinguished	1
foreigner,	1
standing	1
and	1
smoking	1
in	1
elegant	1
meditation	1
at	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
local	1
caf�.	1
He	1
immediately	1
made	1
his	1
way	1
rapidly	1
towards	1
him,	1
considering	1
that	1
a	1
consultation	1
was	1
urgent.	1
But	1
he	1
had	1
hardly	1
crossed	1
half	1
of	1
that	1
stony	1
quadrangle	1
when	1
a	1
window	1
burst	1
open	1
above	1
him	1
and	1
a	1
head	1
was	1
thrust	1
out,	1
shouting.	1
The	1
man	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
woollen	1
undershirt,	1
but	1
Turnbull	1
knew	1
the	1
energetic,	1
apologetic	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
sergeant	1
of	1
police.	1
He	1
pointed	1
furiously	1
at	1
Turnbull	1
and	1
shouted	1
his	1
name.	1
A	1
policeman	1
ran	1
excitedly	1
from	1
under	1
an	1
archway	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
collar	1
him.	1
Two	1
men	1
selling	1
vegetables	1
dropped	1
their	1
baskets	1
and	1
joined	1
in	1
the	1
chase.	1
Turnbull	1
dodged	1
the	1
constable,	1
upset	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
into	1
his	1
own	1
basket,	1
and	1
bounding	1
towards	1
the	1
distinguished	1
foreign	1
Count,	1
called	1
to	1
him	1
clamorously:	1
"Come	1
on,	1
MacIan,	1
the	1
hunt	1
is	1
up	1
again."	1
The	1
prompt	1
reply	1
of	1
Count	1
Gregory	1
was	1
to	1
pull	1
off	1
his	1
large	1
yellow	1
whiskers	1
and	1
scatter	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
breeze	1
with	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
considerable	1
relief.	1
Then	1
he	1
joined	1
the	1
flight	1
of	1
Turnbull,	1
and	1
even	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
so,	1
with	1
one	1
wrench	1
of	1
his	1
powerful	1
hands	1
rent	1
and	1
split	1
the	1
strange,	1
thick	1
stick	1
that	1
he	1
carried.	1
Inside	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
naked	1
old-fashioned	1
rapier.	1
The	1
two	1
got	1
a	1
good	1
start	1
up	1
the	1
road	1
before	1
the	1
whole	1
town	1
was	1
awakened	1
behind	1
them;	1
and	1
half-way	1
up	1
it	1
a	1
similar	1
transformation	1
was	1
seen	1
to	1
take	1
place	1
in	1
Mr.	1
Turnbull's	1
singular	1
umbrella.	1
The	1
two	1
had	1
a	1
long	1
race	1
for	1
the	1
harbour;	1
but	1
the	1
English	1
police	1
were	1
heavy	1
and	1
the	1
French	1
inhabitants	1
were	1
indifferent.	1
In	1
any	1
case,	1
they	1
got	1
used	1
to	1
the	1
notion	1
of	1
the	1
road	1
being	1
clear;	1
and	1
just	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
cliffs	1
MacIan	1
banged	1
into	1
another	1
gentleman	1
with	1
unmistakable	1
surprise.	1
How	1
he	1
knew	1
he	1
was	1
another	1
gentleman	1
merely	1
by	1
banging	1
into	1
him,	1
must	1
remain	1
a	1
mystery.	1
MacIan	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
poor	1
and	1
very	1
sober	1
Scotch	1
gentleman.	1
The	1
other	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
drunk	1
and	1
very	1
wealthy	1
English	1
gentleman.	1
But	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
in	1
the	1
staggered	1
and	1
openly	1
embarrassed	1
apologies	1
that	1
made	1
them	1
understand	1
each	1
other	1
as	1
readily	1
and	1
as	1
quickly	1
and	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
two	1
men	1
talking	1
French	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
China.	1
The	1
nearest	1
expression	1
of	1
the	1
type	1
is	1
that	1
it	1
either	1
hits	1
or	1
apologizes;	1
and	1
in	1
this	1
case	1
both	1
apologized.	1
"You	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
a	1
hurry,"	1
said	1
the	1
unknown	1
Englishman,	1
falling	1
back	1
a	1
step	1
or	1
two	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
laugh	1
with	1
an	1
unnatural	1
heartiness.	1
"What's	1
it	1
all	1
about,	1
eh?"	1
Then	1
before	1
MacIan	1
could	1
get	1
past	1
his	1
sprawling	1
and	1
staggering	1
figure	1
he	1
ran	1
forward	1
again	1
and	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
shouting	1
and	1
ear-shattering	1
whisper:	1
"I	1
say,	1
my	1
name	1
is	1
Wilkinson.	1
_You_	1
know--Wilkinson's	1
Entire	1
was	1
my	1
grandfather.	1
Can't	1
drink	1
beer	1
myself.	1
Liver."	1
And	1
he	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
with	1
extraordinary	1
sagacity.	1
"We	1
really	1
are	1
in	1
a	1
hurry,	1
as	1
you	1
say,"	1
said	1
MacIan,	1
summoning	1
a	1
sufficiently	1
pleasant	1
smile,	1
"so	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
let	1
us	1
pass----"	1
"I'll	1
tell	1
you	1
what,	1
you	1
fellows,"	1
said	1
the	1
sprawling	1
gentleman,	1
confidentially,	1
while	1
Evan's	1
agonized	1
ears	1
heard	1
behind	1
him	1
the	1
first	1
paces	1
of	1
the	1
pursuit,	1
"if	1
you	1
really	1
are,	1
as	1
you	1
say,	1
in	1
a	1
hurry,	1
I	1
know	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
a	1
hurry--Lord,	1
what	1
a	1
hurry	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
when	1
we	1
all	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
Cartwright's	1
rooms--if	1
you	1
really	1
are	1
in	1
a	1
hurry"--and	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
steady	1
his	1
voice	1
into	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
solemnity--"if	1
you	1
are	1
in	1
a	1
hurry,	1
there's	1
nothing	1
like	1
a	1
good	1
yacht	1
for	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
a	1
hurry."	1
"No	1
doubt	1
you're	1
right,"	1
said	1
MacIan,	1
and	1
dashed	1
past	1
him	1
in	1
despair.	1
The	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
pursuing	1
host	1
was	1
just	1
showing	1
over	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
hill	1
behind	1
him.	1
Turnbull	1
had	1
already	1
ducked	1
under	1
the	1
intoxicated	1
gentleman's	1
elbow	1
and	1
fled	1
far	1
in	1
front.	1
"No,	1
but	1
look	1
here,"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Wilkinson,	1
enthusiastically	1
running	1
after	1
MacIan	1
and	1
catching	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
sleeve	1
of	1
his	1
coat.	1
"If	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
hurry	1
you	1
should	1
take	1
a	1
yacht,	1
and	1
if"--he	1
said,	1
with	1
a	1
burst	1
of	1
rationality,	1
like	1
one	1
leaping	1
to	1
a	1
further	1
point	1
in	1
logic--"if	1
you	1
want	1
a	1
yacht--you	1
can	1
have	1
mine."	1
Evan	1
pulled	1
up	1
abruptly	1
and	1
looked	1
back	1
at	1
him.	1
"We	1
are	1
really	1
in	1
the	1
devil	1
of	1
a	1
hurry,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"and	1
if	1
you	1
really	1
have	1
a	1
yacht,	1
the	1
truth	1
is	1
that	1
we	1
would	1
give	1
our	1
ears	1
for	1
it."	1
"You'll	1
find	1
it	1
in	1
harbour,"	1
said	1
Wilkinson,	1
struggling	1
with	1
his	1
speech.	1
"Left	1
side	1
of	1
harbour--called	1
_Gibson	1
Girl_--can't	1
think	1
why,	1
old	1
fellow,	1
I	1
never	1
lent	1
it	1
you	1
before."	1
With	1
these	1
words	1
the	1
benevolent	1
Mr.	1
Wilkinson	1
fell	1
flat	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
in	1
the	1
road,	1
but	1
continued	1
to	1
laugh	1
softly,	1
and	1
turned	1
towards	1
his	1
flying	1
companion	1
a	1
face	1
of	1
peculiar	1
peace	1
and	1
benignity.	1
Evan's	1
mind	1
went	1
through	1
a	1
crisis	1
of	1
instantaneous	1
casuistry,	1
in	1
which	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
that	1
he	1
decided	1
wrongly;	1
but	1
about	1
how	1
he	1
decided	1
his	1
biographer	1
can	1
profess	1
no	1
doubt.	1
Two	1
minutes	1
afterwards	1
he	1
had	1
overtaken	1
Turnbull	1
and	1
told	1
the	1
tale;	1
ten	1
minutes	1
afterwards	1
he	1
and	1
Turnbull	1
had	1
somehow	1
tumbled	1
into	1
the	1
yacht	1
called	1
the	1
_Gibson	1
Girl_	1
and	1
had	1
somehow	1
pushed	1
off	1
from	1
the	1
Isle	1
of	1
St.	1
Loup.	1
XII.	1
THE	1
DESERT	1
ISLAND	1
Those	1
who	1
happen	1
to	1
hold	1
the	1
view	1
(and	1
Mr.	1
Evan	1
MacIan,	1
now	1
alive	1
and	1
comfortable,	1
is	1
among	1
the	1
number)	1
that	1
something	1
supernatural,	1
some	1
eccentric	1
kindness	1
from	1
god	1
or	1
fairy	1
had	1
guided	1
our	1
adventurers	1
through	1
all	1
their	1
absurd	1
perils,	1
might	1
have	1
found	1
his	1
strongest	1
argument	1
perhaps	1
in	1
their	1
management	1
or	1
mismanagement	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Wilkinson's	1
yacht.	1
Neither	1
of	1
them	1
had	1
the	1
smallest	1
qualification	1
for	1
managing	1
such	1
a	1
vessel;	1
but	1
MacIan	1
had	1
a	1
practical	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
in	1
much	1
smaller	1
and	1
quite	1
different	1
boats,	1
while	1
Turnbull	1
had	1
an	1
abstract	1
knowledge	1
of	1
science	1
and	1
some	1
of	1
its	1
applications	1
to	1
navigation,	1
which	1
was	1
worse.	1
The	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
god	1
or	1
fairy	1
can	1
only	1
be	1
deduced	1
from	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
they	1
never	1
definitely	1
ran	1
into	1
anything,	1
either	1
a	1
boat,	1
a	1
rock,	1
a	1
quicksand,	1
or	1
a	1
man-of-war.	1
Apart	1
from	1
this	1
negative	1
description,	1
their	1
voyage	1
would	1
be	1
difficult	1
to	1
describe.	1
It	1
took	1
at	1
least	1
a	1
fortnight,	1
and	1
MacIan,	1
who	1
was	1
certainly	1
the	1
shrewder	1
sailor	1
of	1
the	1
two,	1
realized	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
sailing	1
west	1
into	1
the	1
Atlantic	1
and	1
were	1
probably	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
past	1
the	1
Scilly	1
Isles.	1
How	1
much	1
farther	1
they	1
stood	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
western	1
sea	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
conjecture.	1
But	1
they	1
felt	1
certain,	1
at	1
least,	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
far	1
enough	1
into	1
that	1
awful	1
gulf	1
between	1
us	1
and	1
America	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
unlikely	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
soon	1
see	1
land	1
again.	1
It	1
was	1
therefore	1
with	1
legitimate	1
excitement	1
that	1
one	1
rainy	1
morning	1
after	1
daybreak	1
they	1
saw	1
that	1
distinct	1
shape	1
of	1
a	1
solitary	1
island	1
standing	1
up	1
against	1
the	1
encircling	1
strip	1
of	1
silver	1
which	1
ran	1
round	1
the	1
skyline	1
and	1
separated	1
the	1
grey	1
and	1
green	1
of	1
the	1
billows	1
from	1
the	1
grey	1
and	1
mauve	1
of	1
the	1
morning	1
clouds.	1
"What	1
can	1
it	1
be?"	1
cried	1
MacIan,	1
in	1
a	1
dry-throated	1
excitement.	1
"I	1
didn't	1
know	1
there	1
were	1
any	1
Atlantic	1
islands	1
so	1
far	1
beyond	1
the	1
Scillies--Good	1
Lord,	1
it	1
can't	1
be	1
Madeira,	1
yet?"	1
"I	1
thought	1
you	1
were	1
fond	1
of	1
legends	1
and	1
lies	1
and	1
fables,"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
grimly.	1
"Perhaps	1
it's	1
Atlantis."	1
"Of	1
course,	1
it	1
might	1
be,"	1
answered	1
the	1
other,	1
quite	1
innocently	1
and	1
gravely;	1
"but	1
I	1
never	1
thought	1
the	1
story	1
about	1
Atlantis	1
was	1
very	1
solidly	1
established."	1
"Whatever	1
it	1
is,	1
we	1
are	1
running	1
on	1
to	1
it,"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
equably,	1
"and	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
shipwrecked	1
twice,	1
at	1
any	1
rate."	1
The	1
naked-looking	1
nose	1
of	1
land	1
projecting	1
from	1
the	1
unknown	1
island	1
was,	1
indeed,	1
growing	1
larger	1
and	1
larger,	1
like	1
the	1
trunk	1
of	1
some	1
terrible	1
and	1
advancing	1
elephant.	1
There	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
nothing	1
in	1
particular,	1
at	1
least	1
on	1
this	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
island,	1
except	1
shoals	1
of	1
shellfish	1
lying	1
so	1
thick	1
as	1
almost	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
look	1
like	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
toy	1
grottos	1
that	1
the	1
children	1
make.	1
In	1
one	1
place,	1
however,	1
the	1
coast	1
offered	1
a	1
soft,	1
smooth	1
bay	1
of	1
sand,	1
and	1
even	1
the	1
rudimentary	1
ingenuity	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
amateur	1
mariners	1
managed	1
to	1
run	1
up	1
the	1
little	1
ship	1
with	1
her	1
prow	1
well	1
on	1
shore	1
and	1
her	1
bowsprit	1
pointing	1
upward,	1
as	1
in	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
idiotic	1
triumph.	1
They	1
tumbled	1
on	1
shore	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
unload	1
the	1
vessel,	1
setting	1
the	1
stores	1
out	1
in	1
rows	1
upon	1
the	1
sand	1
with	1
something	1
of	1
the	1
solemnity	1
of	1
boys	1
playing	1
at	1
pirates.	1
There	1
were	1
Mr.	1
Wilkinson's	1
cigar-boxes	1
and	1
Mr.	1
Wilkinson's	1
dozen	1
of	1
champagne	1
and	1
Mr.	1
Wilkinson's	1
tinned	1
salmon	1
and	1
Mr.	1
Wilkinson's	1
tinned	1
tongue	1
and	1
Mr.	1
Wilkinson's	1
tinned	1
sardines,	1
and	1
every	1
sort	1
of	1
preserved	1
thing	1
that	1
could	1
be	1
seen	1
at	1
the	1
Army	1
and	1
Navy	1
stores.	1
Then	1
MacIan	1
stopped	1
with	1
a	1
jar	1
of	1
pickles	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
said	1
abruptly:	1
"I	1
don't	1
know	1
why	1
we're	1
doing	1
all	1
this;	1
I	1
suppose	1
we	1
ought	1
really	1
to	1
fall	1
to	1
and	1
get	1
it	1
over."	1
Then	1
he	1
added	1
more	1
thoughtfully:	1
"Of	1
course	1
this	1
island	1
seems	1
rather	1
bare	1
and	1
the	1
survivor----"	1
"The	1
question	1
is,"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
with	1
cheerful	1
speculation,	1
"whether	1
the	1
survivor	1
will	1
be	1
in	1
a	1
proper	1
frame	1
of	1
mind	1
for	1
potted	1
prawns."	1
MacIan	1
looked	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
rows	1
of	1
tins	1
and	1
bottles,	1
and	1
the	1
cloud	1
of	1
doubt	1
still	1
lowered	1
upon	1
his	1
face.	1
"You	1
will	1
permit	1
me	1
two	1
liberties,	1
my	1
dear	1
sir,"	1
said	1
Turnbull	1
at	1
last:	1
"The	1
first	1
is	1
to	1
break	1
open	1
this	1
box	1
and	1
light	1
one	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Wilkinson's	1
excellent	1
cigars,	1
which	1
will,	1
I	1
am	1
sure,	1
assist	1
my	1
meditations;	1
the	1
second	1
is	1
to	1
offer	1
a	1
penny	1
for	1
your	1
thoughts;	1
or	1
rather	1
to	1
convulse	1
the	1
already	1
complex	1
finances	1
of	1
this	1
island	1
by	1
betting	1
a	1
penny	1
that	1
I	1
know	1
them."	1
"What	1
on	1
earth	1
are	1
you	1
talking	1
about?"	1
asked	1
MacIan,	1
listlessly,	1
in	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
an	1
inattentive	1
child.	1
"I	1
know	1
what	1
you	1
are	1
really	1
thinking,	1
MacIan,"	1
repeated	1
Turnbull,	1
laughing.	1
"I	1
know	1
what	1
I	1
am	1
thinking,	1
anyhow.	1
And	1
I	1
rather	1
fancy	1
it's	1
the	1
same."	1
"What	1
are	1
you	1
thinking?"	1
asked	1
Evan.	1
"I	1
am	1
thinking	1
and	1
you	1
are	1
thinking,"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
"that	1
it	1
is	1
damned	1
silly	1
to	1
waste	1
all	1
that	1
champagne."	1
Something	1
like	1
the	1
spectre	1
of	1
a	1
smile	1
appeared	1
on	1
the	1
unsmiling	1
visage	1
of	1
the	1
Gael;	1
and	1
he	1
made	1
at	1
least	1
no	1
movement	1
of	1
dissent.	1
"We	1
could	1
drink	1
all	1
the	1
wine	1
and	1
smoke	1
all	1
the	1
cigars	1
easily	1
in	1
a	1
week,"	1
said	1
Turnbull;	1
"and	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
die	1
feasting	1
like	1
heroes."	1
"Yes,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
something	1
else,"	1
said	1
MacIan,	1
with	1
slight	1
hesitation.	1
"You	1
see,	1
we	1
are	1
on	1
an	1
almost	1
unknown	1
rock,	1
lost	1
in	1
the	1
Atlantic.	1
The	1
police	1
will	1
never	1
catch	1
us;	1
but	1
then	1
neither	1
may	1
the	1
public	1
ever	1
hear	1
of	1
us;	1
and	1
that	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
we	1
wanted."	1
Then,	1
after	1
a	1
pause,	1
he	1
said,	1
drawing	1
in	1
the	1
sand	1
with	1
his	1
sword-point:	1
"She	1
may	1
never	1
hear	1
of	1
it	1
at	1
all."	1
"Well?"	1
inquired	1
the	1
other,	1
puffing	1
at	1
his	1
cigar.	1
"Well,"	1
said	1
MacIan,	1
"we	1
might	1
occupy	1
a	1
day	1
or	1
two	1
in	1
drawing	1
up	1
a	1
thorough	1
and	1
complete	1
statement	1
of	1
what	1
we	1
did	1
and	1
why	1
we	1
did	1
it,	1
and	1
all	1
about	1
both	1
our	1
points	1
of	1
view.	1
Then	1
we	1
could	1
leave	1
one	1
copy	1
on	1
the	1
island	1
whatever	1
happens	1
to	1
us	1
and	1
put	1
another	1
in	1
an	1
empty	1
bottle	1
and	1
send	1
it	1
out	1
to	1
sea,	1
as	1
they	1
do	1
in	1
the	1
books."	1
"A	1
good	1
idea,"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
"and	1
now	1
let	1
us	1
finish	1
unpacking."	1
As	1
MacIan,	1
a	1
tall,	1
almost	1
ghostly	1
figure,	1
paced	1
along	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
sand	1
that	1
ran	1
round	1
the	1
islet,	1
the	1
purple	1
but	1
cloudy	1
poetry	1
which	1
was	1
his	1
native	1
element	1
was	1
piled	1
up	1
at	1
its	1
thickest	1
upon	1
his	1
soul.	1
The	1
unique	1
island	1
and	1
the	1
endless	1
sea	1
emphasized	1
the	1
thing	1
solely	1
as	1
an	1
epic.	1
There	1
were	1
no	1
ladies	1
or	1
policemen	1
here	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
a	1
hint	1
either	1
of	1
its	1
farce	1
or	1
its	1
tragedy.	1
"Perhaps	1
when	1
the	1
morning	1
stars	1
were	1
made,"	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself,	1
"God	1
built	1
this	1
island	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
tower	1
and	1
a	1
theatre	1
for	1
the	1
fight	1
between	1
yea	1
and	1
nay."	1
Then	1
he	1
wandered	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
highest	1
level	1
of	1
the	1
rock,	1
where	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
roof	1
or	1
plateau	1
of	1
level	1
stone.	1
Half	1
an	1
hour	1
afterwards,	1
Turnbull	1
found	1
him	1
clearing	1
away	1
the	1
loose	1
sand	1
from	1
this	1
table-land	1
and	1
making	1
it	1
smooth	1
and	1
even.	1
"We	1
will	1
fight	1
up	1
here,	1
Turnbull,"	1
said	1
MacIan,	1
"when	1
the	1
time	1
comes.	1
And	1
till	1
the	1
time	1
comes	1
this	1
place	1
shall	1
be	1
sacred."	1
"I	1
thought	1
of	1
having	1
lunch	1
up	1
here,"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
who	1
had	1
a	1
bottle	1
of	1
champagne	1
in	1
his	1
hand.	1
"No,	1
no--not	1
up	1
here,"	1
said	1
MacIan,	1
and	1
came	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
height	1
quite	1
hastily.	1
Before	1
he	1
descended,	1
however,	1
he	1
fixed	1
the	1
two	1
swords	1
upright,	1
one	1
at	1
each	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
platform,	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
human	1
sentinels	1
to	1
guard	1
it	1
under	1
the	1
stars.	1
Then	1
they	1
came	1
down	1
and	1
lunched	1
plentifully	1
in	1
a	1
nest	1
of	1
loose	1
rocks.	1
In	1
the	1
same	1
place	1
that	1
night	1
they	1
supped	1
more	1
plentifully	1
still.	1
The	1
smoke	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Wilkinson's	1
cigars	1
went	1
up	1
ceaseless	1
and	1
strong	1
smelling,	1
like	1
a	1
pagan	1
sacrifice;	1
the	1
golden	1
glories	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Wilkinson's	1
champagne	1
rose	1
to	1
their	1
heads	1
and	1
poured	1
out	1
of	1
them	1
in	1
fancies	1
and	1
philosophies.	1
And	1
occasionally	1
they	1
would	1
look	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
starlight	1
and	1
the	1
rock	1
and	1
see	1
the	1
space	1
guarded	1
by	1
the	1
two	1
cross-hilted	1
swords,	1
which	1
looked	1
like	1
two	1
black	1
crosses	1
at	1
either	1
end	1
of	1
a	1
grave.	1
In	1
this	1
primitive	1
and	1
Homeric	1
truce	1
the	1
week	1
passed	1
by;	1
it	1
consisted	1
almost	1
entirely	1
of	1
eating,	1
drinking,	1
smoking,	1
talking,	1
and	1
occasionally	1
singing.	1
They	1
wrote	1
their	1
records	1
and	1
cast	1
loose	1
their	1
bottle.	1
They	1
never	1
ascended	1
to	1
the	1
ominous	1
plateau;	1
they	1
had	1
never	1
stood	1
there	1
save	1
for	1
that	1
single	1
embarrassed	1
minute	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
had	1
no	1
time	1
to	1
take	1
stock	1
of	1
the	1
seascape	1
or	1
the	1
shape	1
of	1
the	1
land.	1
They	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
explore	1
the	1
island;	1
for	1
MacIan	1
was	1
partly	1
concerned	1
in	1
prayer	1
and	1
Turnbull	1
entirely	1
concerned	1
with	1
tobacco;	1
and	1
both	1
these	1
forms	1
of	1
inspiration	1
can	1
be	1
enjoyed	1
by	1
the	1
secluded	1
and	1
even	1
the	1
sedentary.	1
It	1
was	1
on	1
a	1
golden	1
afternoon,	1
the	1
sun	1
sinking	1
over	1
the	1
sea,	1
rayed	1
like	1
the	1
very	1
head	1
of	1
Apollo,	1
when	1
Turnbull	1
tossed	1
off	1
the	1
last	1
half-pint	1
from	1
the	1
emptied	1
Wilkinsonian	1
bottle,	1
hurled	1
the	1
bottle	1
into	1
the	1
sea	1
with	1
objectless	1
energy,	1
and	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
where	1
his	1
sword	1
stood	1
waiting	1
for	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
hill.	1
MacIan	1
was	1
already	1
standing	1
heavily	1
by	1
his	1
with	1
bent	1
head	1
and	1
eyes	1
reading	1
the	1
ground.	1
He	1
had	1
not	1
even	1
troubled	1
to	1
throw	1
a	1
glance	1
round	1
the	1
island	1
or	1
the	1
horizon.	1
But	1
Turnbull	1
being	1
of	1
a	1
more	1
active	1
and	1
birdlike	1
type	1
of	1
mind	1
did	1
throw	1
a	1
glance	1
round	1
the	1
scene.	1
The	1
consequence	1
of	1
which	1
was	1
that	1
he	1
nearly	1
fell	1
off	1
the	1
rock.	1
On	1
three	1
sides	1
of	1
this	1
shelly	1
and	1
sandy	1
islet	1
the	1
sea	1
stretched	1
blue	1
and	1
infinite	1
without	1
a	1
speck	1
of	1
land	1
or	1
sail;	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
Turnbull	1
had	1
first	1
seen	1
it,	1
except	1
that	1
the	1
tide	1
being	1
out	1
it	1
showed	1
a	1
few	1
yards	1
more	1
of	1
slanting	1
sand	1
under	1
the	1
roots	1
of	1
the	1
rocks.	1
But	1
on	1
the	1
fourth	1
side	1
the	1
island	1
exhibited	1
a	1
more	1
extraordinary	1
feature.	1
In	1
fact,	1
it	1
exhibited	1
the	1
extraordinary	1
feature	1
of	1
not	1
being	1
an	1
island	1
at	1
all.	1
A	1
long,	1
curving	1
neck	1
of	1
sand,	1
as	1
smooth	1
and	1
wet	1
as	1
the	1
neck	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
serpent,	1
ran	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
sea	1
and	1
joined	1
their	1
rock	1
to	1
a	1
line	1
of	1
low,	1
billowing,	1
and	1
glistening	1
sand-hills,	1
which	1
the	1
sinking	1
sea	1
had	1
just	1
bared	1
to	1
the	1
sun.	1
Whether	1
they	1
were	1
firm	1
sand	1
or	1
quicksand	1
it	1
was	1
difficult	1
to	1
guess;	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
at	1
least	1
no	1
doubt	1
that	1
they	1
lay	1
on	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
some	1
larger	1
land;	1
for	1
colourless	1
hills	1
appeared	1
faintly	1
behind	1
them	1
and	1
no	1
sea	1
could	1
be	1
seen	1
beyond.	1
"Sakes	1
alive!"	1
cried	1
Turnbull,	1
with	1
rolling	1
eyes;	1
"this	1
ain't	1
an	1
island	1
in	1
the	1
Atlantic.	1
We've	1
butted	1
the	1
bally	1
continent	1
of	1
America."	1
MacIan	1
turned	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
his	1
face,	1
already	1
pale,	1
grew	1
a	1
shade	1
paler.	1
He	1
was	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
walking	1
in	1
a	1
world	1
of	1
omens	1
and	1
hieroglyphics,	1
and	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
read	1
anything	1
but	1
what	1
was	1
baffling	1
or	1
menacing	1
in	1
this	1
brown	1
gigantic	1
arm	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
stretched	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
sea	1
to	1
seize	1
him.	1
"MacIan,"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
in	1
his	1
temperate	1
way,	1
"whatever	1
our	1
eternal	1
interrupted	1
tete-a-tetes	1
have	1
taught	1
us	1
or	1
not	1
taught	1
us,	1
at	1
least	1
we	1
need	1
not	1
fear	1
the	1
charge	1
of	1
fear.	1
If	1
it	1
is	1
essential	1
to	1
your	1
emotions,	1
I	1
will	1
cheerfully	1
finish	1
the	1
fight	1
here	1
and	1
now;	1
but	1
I	1
must	1
confess	1
that	1
if	1
you	1
kill	1
me	1
here	1
I	1
shall	1
die	1
with	1
my	1
curiosity	1
highly	1
excited	1
and	1
unsatisfied	1
upon	1
a	1
minor	1
point	1
of	1
geography."	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
stop	1
now,"	1
said	1
the	1
other,	1
in	1
his	1
elephantine	1
simplicity,	1
"but	1
we	1
must	1
stop	1
for	1
a	1
moment,	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
sign--perhaps	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
miracle.	1
We	1
must	1
see	1
what	1
is	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
road	1
of	1
sand;	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
a	1
bridge	1
built	1
across	1
the	1
gulf	1
by	1
God."	1
"So	1
long	1
as	1
you	1
gratify	1
my	1
query,"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
laughing	1
and	1
letting	1
back	1
his	1
blade	1
into	1
the	1
sheath,	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
care	1
for	1
what	1
reason	1
you	1
choose	1
to	1
stop."	1
They	1
clambered	1
down	1
the	1
rocky	1
peninsula	1
and	1
trudged	1
along	1
the	1
sandy	1
isthmus	1
with	1
the	1
plodding	1
resolution	1
of	1
men	1
who	1
seemed	1
almost	1
to	1
have	1
made	1
up	1
their	1
minds	1
to	1
be	1
wanderers	1
on	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
Despite	1
Turnbull's	1
air	1
of	1
scientific	1
eagerness,	1
he	1
was	1
really	1
the	1
less	1
impatient	1
of	1
the	1
two;	1
and	1
the	1
Highlander	1
went	1
on	1
well	1
ahead	1
of	1
him	1
with	1
passionate	1
strides.	1
By	1
the	1
time	1
they	1
had	1
walked	1
for	1
about	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
in	1
the	1
ups	1
and	1
downs	1
of	1
those	1
dreary	1
sands,	1
the	1
distance	1
between	1
the	1
two	1
had	1
lengthened	1
and	1
MacIan	1
was	1
only	1
a	1
tall	1
figure	1
silhouetted	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
upon	1
the	1
crest	1
of	1
some	1
sand-dune	1
and	1
then	1
disappearing	1
behind	1
it.	1
This	1
rather	1
increased	1
the	1
Robinson	1
Crusoe	1
feeling	1
in	1
Mr.	1
Turnbull,	1
and	1
he	1
looked	1
about	1
almost	1
disconsolately	1
for	1
some	1
sign	1
of	1
life.	1
What	1
sort	1
of	1
life	1
he	1
expected	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
if	1
it	1
appeared,	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
very	1
clearly	1
know.	1
He	1
has	1
since	1
confessed	1
that	1
he	1
thinks	1
that	1
in	1
his	1
subconsciousness	1
he	1
expected	1
an	1
alligator.	1
The	1
first	1
sign	1
of	1
life	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
see,	1
however,	1
was	1
something	1
more	1
extraordinary	1
than	1
the	1
largest	1
alligator.	1
It	1
was	1
nothing	1
less	1
than	1
the	1
notorious	1
Mr.	1
Evan	1
MacIan	1
coming	1
bounding	1
back	1
across	1
the	1
sand-heaps	1
breathless,	1
without	1
his	1
cap	1
and	1
keeping	1
the	1
sword	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
only	1
by	1
a	1
habit	1
now	1
quite	1
hardened.	1
"Take	1
care,	1
Turnbull,"	1
he	1
cried	1
out	1
from	1
a	1
good	1
distance	1
as	1
he	1
ran,	1
"I've	1
seen	1
a	1
native."	1
"A	1
native?"	1
repeated	1
his	1
companion,	1
whose	1
scenery	1
had	1
of	1
late	1
been	1
chiefly	1
of	1
shellfish,	1
"what	1
the	1
deuce!	1
Do	1
you	1
mean	1
an	1
oyster?"	1
"No,"	1
said	1
MacIan,	1
stopping	1
and	1
breathing	1
hard,	1
"I	1
mean	1
a	1
savage.	1
A	1
black	1
man."	1
"Why,	1
where	1
did	1
you	1
see	1
him?"	1
asked	1
the	1
staring	1
editor.	1
"Over	1
there--behind	1
that	1
hill,"	1
said	1
the	1
gasping	1
MacIan.	1
"He	1
put	1
up	1
his	1
black	1
head	1
and	1
grinned	1
at	1
me."	1
Turnbull	1
thrust	1
his	1
hands	1
through	1
his	1
red	1
hair	1
like	1
one	1
who	1
gives	1
up	1
the	1
world	1
as	1
a	1
bad	1
riddle.	1
"Lord	1
love	1
a	1
duck,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"can	1
it	1
be	1
Jamaica?"	1
Then	1
glancing	1
at	1
his	1
companion	1
with	1
a	1
small	1
frown,	1
as	1
of	1
one	1
slightly	1
suspicious,	1
he	1
said:	1
"I	1
say,	1
don't	1
think	1
me	1
rude--but	1
you're	1
a	1
visionary	1
kind	1
of	1
fellow--and	1
then	1
we	1
drank	1
a	1
great	1
deal.	1
Do	1
you	1
mind	1
waiting	1
here	1
while	1
I	1
go	1
and	1
see	1
for	1
myself?"	1
"Shout	1
if	1
you	1
get	1
into	1
trouble,"	1
said	1
the	1
Celt,	1
with	1
composure;	1
"you	1
will	1
find	1
it	1
as	1
I	1
say."	1
Turnbull	1
ran	1
off	1
ahead	1
with	1
a	1
rapidity	1
now	1
far	1
greater	1
than	1
his	1
rival's,	1
and	1
soon	1
vanished	1
over	1
the	1
disputed	1
sand-hill.	1
Then	1
five	1
minutes	1
passed,	1
and	1
then	1
seven	1
minutes;	1
and	1
MacIan	1
bit	1
his	1
lip	1
and	1
swung	1
his	1
sword,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
did	1
not	1
reappear.	1
Finally,	1
with	1
a	1
Gaelic	1
oath,	1
Evan	1
started	1
forward	1
to	1
the	1
rescue,	1
and	1
almost	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
moment	1
the	1
small	1
figure	1
of	1
the	1
missing	1
man	1
appeared	1
on	1
the	1
ridge	1
against	1
the	1
sky.	1
Even	1
at	1
that	1
distance,	1
however,	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
odd	1
about	1
his	1
attitude;	1
so	1
odd	1
that	1
MacIan	1
continued	1
to	1
make	1
his	1
way	1
in	1
that	1
direction.	1
It	1
looked	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
wounded;	1
or,	1
still	1
more,	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
ill.	1
He	1
wavered	1
as	1
he	1
came	1
down	1
the	1
slope	1
and	1
seemed	1
flinging	1
himself	1
into	1
peculiar	1
postures.	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
within	1
three	1
feet	1
of	1
MacIan's	1
face,	1
that	1
that	1
observer	1
of	1
mankind	1
fully	1
realized	1
that	1
Mr.	1
James	1
Turnbull	1
was	1
roaring	1
with	1
laughter.	1
"You	1
are	1
quit	1
right,"	1
sobbed	1
that	1
wholly	1
demoralized	1
journalist.	1
"He's	1
black,	1
oh,	1
there's	1
no	1
doubt	1
the	1
black's	1
all	1
right--as	1
far	1
as	1
it	1
goes."	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
off	1
again	1
into	1
convulsions	1
of	1
his	1
humorous	1
ailment.	1
"What	1
ever	1
is	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
you?"	1
asked	1
MacIan,	1
with	1
stern	1
impatience.	1
"Did	1
you	1
see	1
the	1
nigger----"	1
"I	1
saw	1
the	1
nigger,"	1
gasped	1
Turnbull.	1
"I	1
saw	1
the	1
splendid	1
barbarian	1
Chief.	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
Emperor	1
of	1
Ethiopia--oh,	1
I	1
saw	1
him	1
all	1
right.	1
The	1
nigger's	1
hands	1
and	1
face	1
are	1
a	1
lovely	1
colour--and	1
the	1
nigger----"	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
overtaken	1
once	1
more.	1
"Well,	1
well,	1
well,"	1
said	1
Evan,	1
stamping	1
each	1
monosyllable	1
on	1
the	1
sand,	1
"what	1
about	1
the	1
nigger?"	1
"Well,	1
the	1
truth	1
is,"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
suddenly	1
and	1
startlingly,	1
becoming	1
quite	1
grave	1
and	1
precise,	1
"the	1
truth	1
is,	1
the	1
nigger	1
is	1
a	1
Margate	1
nigger,	1
and	1
we	1
are	1
now	1
on	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
Isle	1
of	1
Thanet,	1
a	1
few	1
miles	1
from	1
Margate."	1
Then	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
momentary	1
return	1
of	1
his	1
hysteria	1
and	1
said:	1
"I	1
say,	1
old	1
boy,	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
see	1
a	1
chart	1
of	1
our	1
fortnight's	1
cruise	1
in	1
Wilkinson's	1
yacht."	1
MacIan	1
had	1
no	1
smile	1
in	1
answer,	1
but	1
his	1
eager	1
lips	1
opened	1
as	1
if	1
parched	1
for	1
the	1
truth.	1
"You	1
mean	1
to	1
say,"	1
he	1
began----	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
mean	1
to	1
say,"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
"and	1
I	1
mean	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
funnier	1
still.	1
I	1
have	1
learnt	1
everything	1
I	1
wanted	1
to	1
know	1
from	1
the	1
partially	1
black	1
musician	1
over	1
there,	1
who	1
has	1
taken	1
a	1
run	1
in	1
his	1
war-paint	1
to	1
meet	1
a	1
friend	1
in	1
a	1
quiet	1
pub	1
along	1
the	1
coast--the	1
noble	1
savage	1
has	1
told	1
me	1
all	1
about	1
it.	1
The	1
bottle	1
containing	1
our	1
declaration,	1
doctrines,	1
and	1
dying	1
sentiments	1
was	1
washed	1
up	1
on	1
Margate	1
beach	1
yesterday	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
one	1
alderman,	1
two	1
bathing-machine	1
men,	1
three	1
policemen,	1
seven	1
doctors,	1
and	1
a	1
hundred	1
and	1
thirteen	1
London	1
clerks	1
on	1
a	1
holiday,	1
to	1
all	1
of	1
whom,	1
whether	1
directly	1
or	1
indirectly,	1
our	1
composition	1
gave	1
enormous	1
literary	1
pleasure.	1
Buck	1
up,	1
old	1
man,	1
this	1
story	1
of	1
ours	1
is	1
a	1
switchback.	1
I	1
have	1
begun	1
to	1
understand	1
the	1
pulse	1
and	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
it;	1
now	1
we	1
are	1
up	1
in	1
a	1
cathedral	1
and	1
then	1
we	1
are	1
down	1
in	1
a	1
theatre,	1
where	1
they	1
only	1
play	1
farces.	1
Come,	1
I	1
am	1
quite	1
reconciled--let	1
us	1
enjoy	1
the	1
farce."	1
But	1
MacIan	1
said	1
nothing,	1
and	1
an	1
instant	1
afterwards	1
Turnbull	1
himself	1
called	1
out	1
in	1
an	1
entirely	1
changed	1
voice:	1
"Oh,	1
this	1
is	1
damnable!	1
This	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
borne!"	1
MacIan	1
followed	1
his	1
eye	1
along	1
the	1
sand-hills.	1
He	1
saw	1
what	1
looked	1
like	1
the	1
momentary	1
and	1
waving	1
figure	1
of	1
the	1
nigger	1
minstrel,	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
saw	1
a	1
heavy	1
running	1
policeman	1
take	1
the	1
turn	1
of	1
the	1
sand-hill	1
with	1
the	1
smooth	1
solemnity	1
of	1
a	1
railway	1
train.	1
XIII.	1
THE	1
GARDEN	1
OF	1
PEACE	1
Up	1
to	1
this	1
instant	1
Evan	1
MacIan	1
had	1
really	1
understood	1
nothing;	1
but	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
policeman	1
he	1
saw	1
everything.	1
He	1
saw	1
his	1
enemies,	1
all	1
the	1
powers	1
and	1
princes	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
He	1
suddenly	1
altered	1
from	1
a	1
staring	1
statue	1
to	1
a	1
leaping	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
mountains.	1
"We	1
must	1
break	1
away	1
from	1
him	1
here,"	1
he	1
cried,	1
briefly,	1
and	1
went	1
like	1
a	1
whirlwind	1
over	1
the	1
sand	1
ridge	1
in	1
a	1
straight	1
line	1
and	1
at	1
a	1
particular	1
angle.	1
When	1
the	1
policeman	1
had	1
finished	1
his	1
admirable	1
railway	1
curve,	1
he	1
found	1
a	1
wall	1
of	1
failing	1
sand	1
between	1
him	1
and	1
the	1
pursued.	1
By	1
the	1
time	1
he	1
had	1
scaled	1
it	1
thrice,	1
slid	1
down	1
twice,	1
and	1
crested	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
third	1
effort,	1
the	1
two	1
flying	1
figures	1
were	1
far	1
in	1
front.	1
They	1
found	1
the	1
sand	1
harder	1
farther	1
on;	1
it	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
crusted	1
with	1
scraps	1
of	1
turf	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
moments	1
they	1
were	1
flying	1
easily	1
over	1
an	1
open	1
common	1
of	1
rank	1
sea-grass.	1
They	1
had	1
no	1
easy	1
business,	1
however;	1
for	1
the	1
bottle	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
so	1
innocently	1
sent	1
into	1
the	1
chief	1
gate	1
of	1
Thanet	1
had	1
called	1
to	1
life	1
the	1
police	1
of	1
half	1
a	1
county	1
on	1
their	1
trail.	1
From	1
every	1
side	1
across	1
the	1
grey-green	1
common	1
figures	1
could	1
be	1
seen	1
running	1
and	1
closing	1
in;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
when	1
MacIan	1
with	1
his	1
big	1
body	1
broke	1
down	1
the	1
tangled	1
barrier	1
of	1
a	1
little	1
wood,	1
as	1
men	1
break	1
down	1
a	1
door	1
with	1
the	1
shoulder;	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
when	1
they	1
vanished	1
crashing	1
into	1
the	1
underworld	1
of	1
the	1
black	1
wood,	1
that	1
their	1
hunters	1
were	1
even	1
instantaneously	1
thrown	1
off	1
the	1
scent.	1
At	1
the	1
risk	1
of	1
struggling	1
a	1
little	1
longer	1
like	1
flies	1
in	1
that	1
black	1
web	1
of	1
twigs	1
and	1
trunks,	1
Evan	1
(who	1
had	1
an	1
instinct	1
of	1
the	1
hunter	1
or	1
the	1
hunted)	1
took	1
an	1
incalculable	1
course	1
through	1
the	1
forest,	1
which	1
let	1
them	1
out	1
at	1
last	1
by	1
a	1
forest	1
opening--quite	1
forgotten	1
by	1
the	1
leaders	1
of	1
the	1
chase.	1
They	1
ran	1
a	1
mile	1
or	1
two	1
farther	1
along	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
wood	1
until	1
they	1
reached	1
another	1
and	1
somewhat	1
similar	1
opening.	1
Then	1
MacIan	1
stood	1
utterly	1
still	1
and	1
listened,	1
as	1
animals	1
listen,	1
for	1
every	1
sound	1
in	1
the	1
universe.	1
Then	1
he	1
said:	1
"We	1
are	1
quit	1
of	1
them."	1
And	1
Turnbull	1
said:	1
"Where	1
shall	1
we	1
go	1
now?"	1
MacIan	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
silver	1
sunset	1
that	1
was	1
closing	1
in,	1
barred	1
by	1
plumy	1
lines	1
of	1
purple	1
cloud;	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
high	1
tree-tops	1
that	1
caught	1
the	1
last	1
light	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
birds	1
going	1
heavily	1
homeward,	1
just	1
as	1
if	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
were	1
bits	1
of	1
written	1
advice	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
read.	1
Then	1
he	1
said:	1
"The	1
best	1
place	1
we	1
can	1
go	1
to	1
is	1
to	1
bed.	1
If	1
we	1
can	1
get	1
some	1
sleep	1
in	1
this	1
wood,	1
now	1
everyone	1
has	1
cleared	1
out	1
of	1
it,	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
worth	1
a	1
handicap	1
of	1
two	1
hundred	1
yards	1
tomorrow."	1
Turnbull,	1
who	1
was	1
exceptionally	1
lively	1
and	1
laughing	1
in	1
his	1
demeanour,	1
kicked	1
his	1
legs	1
about	1
like	1
a	1
schoolboy	1
and	1
said	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
sleep.	1
He	1
walked	1
incessantly	1
and	1
talked	1
very	1
brilliantly.	1
And	1
when	1
at	1
last	1
he	1
lay	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
hard	1
earth,	1
sleep	1
struck	1
him	1
senseless	1
like	1
a	1
hammer.	1
Indeed,	1
he	1
needed	1
the	1
strongest	1
sleep	1
he	1
could	1
get;	1
for	1
the	1
earth	1
was	1
still	1
full	1
of	1
darkness	1
and	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
morning	1
fog	1
when	1
his	1
fellow-fugitive	1
shook	1
him	1
awake.	1
"No	1
more	1
sleep,	1
I'm	1
afraid,"	1
said	1
Evan,	1
in	1
a	1
heavy,	1
almost	1
submissive,	1
voice	1
of	1
apology.	1
"They've	1
gone	1
on	1
past	1
us	1
right	1
enough	1
for	1
a	1
good	1
thirty	1
miles;	1
but	1
now	1
they've	1
found	1
out	1
their	1
mistake,	1
and	1
they're	1
coming	1
back."	1
"Are	1
you	1
sure?"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
sitting	1
up	1
and	1
rubbing	1
his	1
red	1
eyebrows	1
with	1
his	1
hand.	1
The	1
next	1
moment,	1
however,	1
he	1
had	1
jumped	1
up	1
alive	1
and	1
leaping	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
struck	1
with	1
a	1
shock	1
of	1
cold	1
water,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
plunging	1
after	1
MacIan	1
along	1
the	1
woodland	1
path.	1
The	1
shape	1
of	1
their	1
old	1
friend	1
the	1
constable	1
had	1
appeared	1
against	1
the	1
pearl	1
and	1
pink	1
of	1
the	1
sunrise.	1
Somehow,	1
it	1
always	1
looked	1
a	1
very	1
funny	1
shape	1
when	1
seen	1
against	1
the	1
sunrise.	1
*	1
*	1
*	1
A	1
wash	1
of	1
weary	1
daylight	1
was	1
breaking	1
over	1
the	1
country-side,	1
and	1
the	1
fields	1
and	1
roads	1
were	1
full	1
of	1
white	1
mist--the	1
kind	1
of	1
white	1
mist	1
that	1
clings	1
in	1
corners	1
like	1
cotton	1
wool.	1
The	1
empty	1
road,	1
along	1
which	1
the	1
chase	1
had	1
taken	1
its	1
turn,	1
was	1
overshadowed	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
by	1
a	1
very	1
high	1
discoloured	1
wall,	1
stained,	1
and	1
streaked	1
green,	1
as	1
with	1
seaweed--evidently	1
the	1
high-shouldered	1
sentinel	1
of	1
some	1
great	1
gentleman's	1
estate.	1
A	1
yard	1
or	1
two	1
from	1
the	1
wall	1
ran	1
parallel	1
to	1
it	1
a	1
linked	1
and	1
tangled	1
line	1
of	1
lime-trees,	1
forming	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
cloister	1
along	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
road.	1
It	1
was	1
under	1
this	1
branching	1
colonnade	1
that	1
the	1
two	1
fugitives	1
fled,	1
almost	1
concealed	1
from	1
their	1
pursuers	1
by	1
the	1
twilight,	1
the	1
mist	1
and	1
the	1
leaping	1
zoetrope	1
of	1
shadows.	1
Their	1
feet,	1
though	1
beating	1
the	1
ground	1
furiously,	1
made	1
but	1
a	1
faint	1
noise;	1
for	1
they	1
had	1
kicked	1
away	1
their	1
boots	1
in	1
the	1
wood;	1
their	1
long,	1
antiquated	1
weapons	1
made	1
no	1
jingle	1
or	1
clatter,	1
for	1
they	1
had	1
strapped	1
them	1
across	1
their	1
backs	1
like	1
guitars.	1
They	1
had	1
all	1
the	1
advantages	1
that	1
invisibility	1
and	1
silence	1
can	1
add	1
to	1
speed.	1
A	1
hundred	1
and	1
fifty	1
yards	1
behind	1
them	1
down	1
the	1
centre	1
of	1
the	1
empty	1
road	1
the	1
first	1
of	1
their	1
pursuers	1
came	1
pounding	1
and	1
panting--a	1
fat	1
but	1
powerful	1
policeman	1
who	1
had	1
distanced	1
all	1
the	1
rest.	1
He	1
came	1
on	1
at	1
a	1
splendid	1
pace	1
for	1
so	1
portly	1
a	1
figure;	1
but,	1
like	1
all	1
heavy	1
bodies	1
in	1
motion,	1
he	1
gave	1
the	1
impression	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
easier	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
increase	1
his	1
pace	1
than	1
to	1
slacken	1
it	1
suddenly.	1
Nothing	1
short	1
of	1
a	1
brick	1
wall	1
could	1
have	1
abruptly	1
brought	1
him	1
up.	1
Turnbull	1
turned	1
his	1
head	1
slightly	1
and	1
found	1
breath	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
to	1
MacIan.	1
MacIan	1
nodded.	1
Pursuer	1
and	1
pursued	1
were	1
fixed	1
in	1
their	1
distance	1
as	1
they	1
fled,	1
for	1
some	1
quarter	1
of	1
a	1
mile,	1
when	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
place	1
where	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
of	1
the	1
trees	1
grew	1
twistedly	1
together,	1
making	1
a	1
special	1
obscurity.	1
Past	1
this	1
place	1
the	1
pursuing	1
policeman	1
went	1
thundering	1
without	1
thought	1
or	1
hesitation.	1
But	1
he	1
was	1
pursuing	1
his	1
shadow	1
or	1
the	1
wind;	1
for	1
Turnbull	1
had	1
put	1
one	1
foot	1
in	1
a	1
crack	1
of	1
the	1
tree	1
and	1
gone	1
up	1
it	1
as	1
quickly	1
and	1
softly	1
as	1
a	1
cat.	1
Somewhat	1
more	1
laboriously	1
but	1
in	1
equal	1
silence	1
the	1
long	1
legs	1
of	1
the	1
Highlander	1
had	1
followed;	1
and	1
crouching	1
in	1
crucial	1
silence	1
in	1
the	1
cloud	1
of	1
leaves,	1
they	1
saw	1
the	1
whole	1
posse	1
of	1
their	1
pursuers	1
go	1
by	1
and	1
die	1
into	1
the	1
dust	1
and	1
mists	1
of	1
the	1
distance.	1
The	1
white	1
vapour	1
lay,	1
as	1
it	1
often	1
does,	1
in	1
lean	1
and	1
palpable	1
layers;	1
and	1
even	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
tree	1
was	1
above	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
half-daylight,	1
like	1
a	1
green	1
ship	1
swinging	1
on	1
a	1
sea	1
of	1
foam.	1
But	1
higher	1
yet	1
behind	1
them,	1
and	1
readier	1
to	1
catch	1
the	1
first	1
coming	1
of	1
the	1
sun,	1
ran	1
the	1
rampart	1
of	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
wall,	1
which	1
in	1
their	1
excitement	1
of	1
escape	1
looked	1
at	1
once	1
indispensable	1
and	1
unattainable,	1
like	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
heaven.	1
Here,	1
however,	1
it	1
was	1
MacIan's	1
turn	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
advantage;	1
for,	1
though	1
less	1
light-limbed	1
and	1
feline,	1
he	1
was	1
longer	1
and	1
stronger	1
in	1
the	1
arms.	1
In	1
two	1
seconds	1
he	1
had	1
tugged	1
up	1
his	1
chin	1
over	1
the	1
wall	1
like	1
a	1
horizontal	1
bar;	1
the	1
next	1
he	1
sat	1
astride	1
of	1
it,	1
like	1
a	1
horse	1
of	1
stone.	1
With	1
his	1
assistance	1
Turnbull	1
vaulted	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
perch,	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
began	1
cautiously	1
to	1
shift	1
along	1
the	1
wall	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
by	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
come,	1
doubling	1
on	1
their	1
tracks	1
to	1
throw	1
off	1
the	1
last	1
pursuit.	1
MacIan	1
could	1
not	1
rid	1
himself	1
of	1
the	1
fancy	1
of	1
bestriding	1
a	1
steed;	1
the	1
long,	1
grey	1
coping	1
of	1
the	1
wall	1
shot	1
out	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
him,	1
like	1
the	1
long,	1
grey	1
neck	1
of	1
some	1
nightmare	1
Rosinante.	1
He	1
had	1
the	1
quaint	1
thought	1
that	1
he	1
and	1
Turnbull	1
were	1
two	1
knights	1
on	1
one	1
steed	1
on	1
the	1
old	1
shield	1
of	1
the	1
Templars.	1
The	1
nightmare	1
of	1
the	1
stone	1
horse	1
was	1
increased	1
by	1
the	1
white	1
fog,	1
which	1
seemed	1
thicker	1
inside	1
the	1
wall	1
than	1
outside.	1
They	1
could	1
make	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
enclosure	1
upon	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
partial	1
trespassers,	1
except	1
that	1
the	1
green	1
and	1
crooked	1
branches	1
of	1
a	1
big	1
apple-tree	1
came	1
crawling	1
at	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mist,	1
like	1
the	1
tentacles	1
of	1
some	1
green	1
cuttlefish.	1
Anything	1
would	1
serve,	1
however,	1
that	1
was	1
likely	1
to	1
confuse	1
their	1
trail,	1
so	1
they	1
both	1
decided	1
without	1
need	1
of	1
words	1
to	1
use	1
this	1
tree	1
also	1
as	1
a	1
ladder--a	1
ladder	1
of	1
descent.	1
When	1
they	1
dropped	1
from	1
the	1
lowest	1
branch	1
to	1
the	1
ground	1
their	1
stockinged	1
feet	1
felt	1
hard	1
gravel	1
beneath	1
them.	1
They	1
had	1
alighted	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
a	1
very	1
broad	1
garden	1
path,	1
and	1
the	1
clearing	1
mist	1
permitted	1
them	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
a	1
well-clipped	1
lawn.	1
Though	1
the	1
white	1
vapour	1
was	1
still	1
a	1
veil,	1
it	1
was	1
like	1
the	1
gauzy	1
veil	1
of	1
a	1
transformation	1
scene	1
in	1
a	1
pantomime;	1
for	1
through	1
it	1
there	1
glowed	1
shapeless	1
masses	1
of	1
colour,	1
masses	1
which	1
might	1
be	1
clouds	1
of	1
sunrise	1
or	1
mosaics	1
of	1
gold	1
and	1
crimson,	1
or	1
ladies	1
robed	1
in	1
ruby	1
and	1
emerald	1
draperies.	1
As	1
it	1
thinned	1
yet	1
farther	1
they	1
saw	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
flowers;	1
but	1
flowers	1
in	1
such	1
insolent	1
mass	1
and	1
magnificence	1
as	1
can	1
seldom	1
be	1
seen	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
tropics.	1
Purple	1
and	1
crimson	1
rhododendrons	1
rose	1
arrogantly,	1
like	1
rampant	1
heraldic	1
animals	1
against	1
their	1
burning	1
background	1
of	1
laburnum	1
gold.	1
The	1
roses	1
were	1
red	1
hot;	1
the	1
clematis	1
was,	1
so	1
to	1
speak,	1
blue	1
hot.	1
And	1
yet	1
the	1
mere	1
whiteness	1
of	1
the	1
syringa	1
seemed	1
the	1
most	1
violent	1
colour	1
of	1
all.	1
As	1
the	1
golden	1
sunlight	1
gradually	1
conquered	1
the	1
mists,	1
it	1
had	1
really	1
something	1
of	1
the	1
sensational	1
sweetness	1
of	1
the	1
slow	1
opening	1
of	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
Eden.	1
MacIan,	1
whose	1
mind	1
was	1
always	1
haunted	1
with	1
such	1
seraphic	1
or	1
titanic	1
parallels,	1
made	1
some	1
such	1
remark	1
to	1
his	1
companion.	1
But	1
Turnbull	1
only	1
cursed	1
and	1
said	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
back	1
garden	1
of	1
some	1
damnable	1
rich	1
man.	1
When	1
the	1
last	1
haze	1
had	1
faded	1
from	1
the	1
ordered	1
paths,	1
the	1
open	1
lawns,	1
and	1
the	1
flaming	1
flower-beds,	1
the	1
two	1
realized,	1
not	1
without	1
an	1
abrupt	1
re-examination	1
of	1
their	1
position,	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
alone	1
in	1
the	1
garden.	1
Down	1
the	1
centre	1
of	1
the	1
central	1
garden	1
path,	1
preceded	1
by	1
a	1
blue	1
cloud	1
from	1
a	1
cigarette,	1
was	1
walking	1
a	1
gentleman	1
who	1
evidently	1
understood	1
all	1
the	1
relish	1
of	1
a	1
garden	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
early	1
morning.	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
slim	1
yet	1
satisfied	1
figure,	1
clad	1
in	1
a	1
suit	1
of	1
pale-grey	1
tweed,	1
so	1
subdued	1
that	1
the	1
pattern	1
was	1
imperceptible--a	1
costume	1
that	1
was	1
casual	1
but	1
not	1
by	1
any	1
means	1
careless.	1
His	1
face,	1
which	1
was	1
reflective	1
and	1
somewhat	1
over-refined,	1
was	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
a	1
quite	1
elderly	1
man,	1
though	1
his	1
stringy	1
hair	1
and	1
moustache	1
were	1
still	1
quite	1
yellow.	1
A	1
double	1
eye-glass,	1
with	1
a	1
broad,	1
black	1
ribbon,	1
drooped	1
from	1
his	1
aquiline	1
nose,	1
and	1
he	1
smiled,	1
as	1
he	1
communed	1
with	1
himself,	1
with	1
a	1
self-content	1
which	1
was	1
rare	1
and	1
almost	1
irritating.	1
The	1
straw	1
panama	1
on	1
his	1
head	1
was	1
many	1
shades	1
shabbier	1
than	1
his	1
clothes,	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
caught	1
it	1
up	1
by	1
accident.	1
It	1
needed	1
the	1
full	1
shock	1
of	1
the	1
huge	1
shadow	1
of	1
MacIan,	1
falling	1
across	1
his	1
sunlit	1
path,	1
to	1
rouse	1
him	1
from	1
his	1
smiling	1
reverie.	1
When	1
this	1
had	1
fallen	1
on	1
him	1
he	1
lifted	1
his	1
head	1
a	1
little	1
and	1
blinked	1
at	1
the	1
intruders	1
with	1
short-sighted	1
benevolence,	1
but	1
with	1
far	1
less	1
surprise	1
than	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
expected.	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
gentleman;	1
that	1
is,	1
he	1
had	1
social	1
presence	1
of	1
mind,	1
whether	1
for	1
kindness	1
or	1
for	1
insolence.	1
"Can	1
I	1
do	1
anything	1
for	1
you?"	1
he	1
said,	1
at	1
last.	1
MacIan	1
bowed.	1
"You	1
can	1
extend	1
to	1
us	1
your	1
pardon,"	1
he	1
said,	1
for	1
he	1
also	1
came	1
of	1
a	1
whole	1
race	1
of	1
gentlemen--of	1
gentlemen	1
without	1
shirts	1
to	1
their	1
backs.	1
"I	1
am	1
afraid	1
we	1
are	1
trespassing.	1
We	1
have	1
just	1
come	1
over	1
the	1
wall."	1
"Over	1
the	1
wall?"	1
repeated	1
the	1
smiling	1
old	1
gentleman,	1
still	1
without	1
letting	1
his	1
surprise	1
come	1
uppermost.	1
"I	1
suppose	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
wrong,	1
sir,"	1
continued	1
MacIan,	1
"in	1
supposing	1
that	1
these	1
grounds	1
inside	1
the	1
wall	1
belong	1
to	1
you?"	1
The	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
panama	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
ground	1
and	1
smoked	1
thoughtfully	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
moments,	1
after	1
which	1
he	1
said,	1
with	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
matured	1
conviction:	1
"Yes,	1
certainly;	1
the	1
grounds	1
inside	1
the	1
wall	1
really	1
belong	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
the	1
grounds	1
outside	1
the	1
wall,	1
too."	1
"A	1
large	1
proprietor,	1
I	1
imagine,"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
with	1
a	1
truculent	1
eye.	1
"Yes,"	1
answered	1
the	1
old	1
gentleman,	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
steady	1
smile.	1
"A	1
large	1
proprietor."	1
Turnbull's	1
eye	1
grew	1
even	1
more	1
offensive,	1
and	1
he	1
began	1
biting	1
his	1
red	1
beard;	1
but	1
MacIan	1
seemed	1
to	1
recognize	1
a	1
type	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
deal	1
and	1
continued	1
quite	1
easily:	1
"I	1
am	1
sure	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
like	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
need	1
to	1
be	1
told	1
that	1
one	1
sees	1
and	1
does	1
a	1
good	1
many	1
things	1
that	1
do	1
not	1
get	1
into	1
the	1
newspapers.	1
Things	1
which,	1
on	1
the	1
whole,	1
had	1
better	1
not	1
get	1
into	1
the	1
newspapers."	1
The	1
smile	1
of	1
the	1
large	1
proprietor	1
broadened	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
under	1
his	1
loose,	1
light	1
moustache,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
continued	1
with	1
increased	1
confidence:	1
"One	1
sometimes	1
wants	1
to	1
have	1
it	1
out	1
with	1
another	1
man.	1
The	1
police	1
won't	1
allow	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
streets--and	1
then	1
there's	1
the	1
County	1
Council--and	1
in	1
the	1
fields	1
even	1
nothing's	1
allowed	1
but	1
posters	1
of	1
pills.	1
But	1
in	1
a	1
gentleman's	1
garden,	1
now----"	1
The	1
strange	1
gentleman	1
smiled	1
again	1
and	1
said,	1
easily	1
enough:	1
"Do	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
fight?	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
fight	1
about?"	1
MacIan	1
had	1
understood	1
his	1
man	1
pretty	1
well	1
up	1
to	1
that	1
point;	1
an	1
instinct	1
common	1
to	1
all	1
men	1
with	1
the	1
aristocratic	1
tradition	1
of	1
Europe	1
had	1
guided	1
him.	1
He	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
kind	1
of	1
man	1
who	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
back	1
garden	1
wears	1
good	1
clothes	1
and	1
spoils	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
bad	1
hat	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
kind	1
of	1
man	1
who	1
has	1
an	1
abstract	1
horror	1
of	1
illegal	1
actions	1
of	1
violence	1
or	1
the	1
evasion	1
of	1
the	1
police.	1
But	1
a	1
man	1
may	1
understand	1
ragging	1
and	1
yet	1
be	1
very	1
far	1
from	1
understanding	1
religious	1
ragging.	1
This	1
seeming	1
host	1
of	1
theirs	1
might	1
comprehend	1
a	1
quarrel	1
of	1
husband	1
and	1
lover	1
or	1
a	1
difficulty	1
at	1
cards	1
or	1
even	1
escape	1
from	1
a	1
pursuing	1
tailor;	1
but	1
it	1
still	1
remained	1
doubtful	1
whether	1
he	1
would	1
feel	1
the	1
earth	1
fail	1
under	1
him	1
in	1
that	1
earthquake	1
instant	1
when	1
the	1
Virgin	1
is	1
compared	1
to	1
a	1
goddess	1
of	1
Mesopotamia.	1
Even	1
MacIan,	1
therefore	1
(whose	1
tact	1
was	1
far	1
from	1
being	1
his	1
strong	1
point),	1
felt	1
the	1
necessity	1
for	1
some	1
compromise	1
in	1
the	1
mode	1
of	1
approach.	1
At	1
last	1
he	1
said,	1
and	1
even	1
then	1
with	1
hesitation:	1
"We	1
are	1
fighting	1
about	1
God;	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
nothing	1
so	1
important	1
as	1
that."	1
The	1
tilted	1
eye-glasses	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
gentleman	1
fell	1
abruptly	1
from	1
his	1
nose,	1
and	1
he	1
thrust	1
his	1
aristocratic	1
chin	1
so	1
far	1
forward	1
that	1
his	1
lean	1
neck	1
seemed	1
to	1
shoot	1
out	1
longer	1
like	1
a	1
telescope.	1
"About	1
God?"	1
he	1
queried,	1
in	1
a	1
key	1
completely	1
new.	1
"Look	1
here!"	1
cried	1
Turnbull,	1
taking	1
his	1
turn	1
roughly,	1
"I'll	1
tell	1
you	1
what	1
it's	1
all	1
about.	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
there's	1
no	1
God.	1
I	1
take	1
it	1
that	1
it's	1
nobody's	1
business	1
but	1
mine--or	1
God's,	1
if	1
there	1
is	1
one.	1
This	1
young	1
gentleman	1
from	1
the	1
Highlands	1
happens	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
it's	1
his	1
business.	1
In	1
consequence,	1
he	1
first	1
takes	1
a	1
walking-stick	1
and	1
smashes	1
my	1
shop;	1
then	1
he	1
takes	1
the	1
same	1
walking-stick	1
and	1
tries	1
to	1
smash	1
me.	1
To	1
this	1
I	1
naturally	1
object.	1
I	1
suggest	1
that	1
if	1
it	1
comes	1
to	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
both	1
have	1
sticks.	1
He	1
improves	1
on	1
the	1
suggestion	1
and	1
proposes	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
both	1
have	1
steel-pointed	1
sticks.	1
The	1
police	1
(with	1
characteristic	1
unreasonableness)	1
will	1
not	1
accept	1
either	1
of	1
our	1
proposals;	1
the	1
result	1
is	1
that	1
we	1
run	1
about	1
dodging	1
the	1
police	1
and	1
have	1
jumped	1
over	1
our	1
garden	1
wall	1
into	1
your	1
magnificent	1
garden	1
to	1
throw	1
ourselves	1
on	1
your	1
magnificent	1
hospitality."	1
The	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
gentleman	1
had	1
grown	1
redder	1
and	1
redder	1
during	1
this	1
address,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
still	1
smiling;	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
broke	1
out	1
it	1
was	1
with	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
guffaw.	1
"So	1
you	1
really	1
want	1
to	1
fight	1
with	1
drawn	1
swords	1
in	1
my	1
garden,"	1
he	1
asked,	1
"about	1
whether	1
there	1
is	1
really	1
a	1
God?"	1
"Why	1
not?"	1
said	1
MacIan,	1
with	1
his	1
simple	1
monstrosity	1
of	1
speech;	1
"all	1
man's	1
worship	1
began	1
when	1
the	1
Garden	1
of	1
Eden	1
was	1
founded."	1
"Yes,	1
by----!"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
with	1
an	1
oath,	1
"and	1
ended	1
when	1
the	1
Zoological	1
Gardens	1
were	1
founded."	1
"In	1
this	1
garden!	1
In	1
my	1
presence!"	1
cried	1
the	1
stranger,	1
stamping	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
gravel	1
and	1
choking	1
with	1
laughter,"	1
whether	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
God!"	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
stamping	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
garden,	1
making	1
it	1
echo	1
with	1
his	1
unintelligible	1
laughter.	1
Then	1
he	1
came	1
back	1
to	1
them	1
more	1
composed	1
and	1
wiping	1
his	1
eyes.	1
"Why,	1
how	1
small	1
the	1
world	1
is!"	1
he	1
cried	1
at	1
last.	1
"I	1
can	1
settle	1
the	1
whole	1
matter.	1
Why,	1
I	1
am	1
God!"	1
And	1
he	1
suddenly	1
began	1
to	1
kick	1
and	1
wave	1
his	1
well-clad	1
legs	1
about	1
the	1
lawn.	1
"You	1
are	1
what?"	1
repeated	1
Turnbull,	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
which	1
is	1
beyond	1
description.	1
"Why,	1
God,	1
of	1
course!"	1
answered	1
the	1
other,	1
thoroughly	1
amused.	1
"How	1
funny	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
tumbled	1
over	1
a	1
garden	1
wall	1
and	1
fallen	1
exactly	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
person!	1
You	1
might	1
have	1
gone	1
floundering	1
about	1
in	1
all	1
sorts	1
of	1
churches	1
and	1
chapels	1
and	1
colleges	1
and	1
schools	1
of	1
philosophy	1
looking	1
for	1
some	1
evidence	1
of	1
the	1
existence	1
of	1
God.	1
Why,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
evidence,	1
except	1
seeing	1
him.	1
And	1
now	1
you've	1
seen	1
him.	1
You've	1
seen	1
him	1
dance!"	1
And	1
the	1
obliging	1
old	1
gentleman	1
instantly	1
stood	1
on	1
one	1
leg	1
without	1
relaxing	1
at	1
all	1
the	1
grave	1
and	1
cultured	1
benignity	1
of	1
his	1
expression.	1
"I	1
understood	1
that	1
this	1
garden----"	1
began	1
the	1
bewildered	1
MacIan.	1
"Quite	1
so!	1
Quite	1
so!"	1
said	1
the	1
man	1
on	1
one	1
leg,	1
nodding	1
gravely.	1
"I	1
said	1
this	1
garden	1
belonged	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
the	1
land	1
outside	1
it.	1
So	1
they	1
do.	1
So	1
does	1
the	1
country	1
beyond	1
that	1
and	1
the	1
sea	1
beyond	1
that	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
So	1
does	1
the	1
moon.	1
So	1
do	1
the	1
sun	1
and	1
stars."	1
And	1
he	1
added,	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
of	1
apology:	1
"You	1
see,	1
I'm	1
God."	1
Turnbull	1
and	1
MacIan	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
for	1
one	1
moment	1
with	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
notion	1
that	1
perhaps	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
too	1
old	1
to	1
be	1
merely	1
playing	1
the	1
fool.	1
But	1
after	1
staring	1
steadily	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
Turnbull	1
saw	1
the	1
hard	1
and	1
horrible	1
earnestness	1
in	1
the	1
man's	1
eyes	1
behind	1
all	1
his	1
empty	1
animation.	1
Then	1
Turnbull	1
looked	1
very	1
gravely	1
at	1
the	1
strict	1
gravel	1
walls	1
and	1
the	1
gay	1
flower-beds	1
and	1
the	1
long	1
rectangular	1
red-brick	1
building,	1
which	1
the	1
mist	1
had	1
left	1
evident	1
beyond	1
them.	1
Then	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
MacIan.	1
Almost	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
moment	1
another	1
man	1
came	1
walking	1
quickly	1
round	1
the	1
regal	1
clump	1
of	1
rhododendrons.	1
He	1
had	1
the	1
look	1
of	1
a	1
prosperous	1
banker,	1
wore	1
a	1
good	1
tall	1
silk	1
hat,	1
was	1
almost	1
stout	1
enough	1
to	1
burst	1
the	1
buttons	1
of	1
a	1
fine	1
frock-coat;	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
talking	1
to	1
himself,	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
elbows	1
had	1
a	1
singular	1
outward	1
jerk	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
by.	1
XIV.	1
A	1
MUSEUM	1
OF	1
SOULS	1
The	1
man	1
with	1
the	1
good	1
hat	1
and	1
the	1
jumping	1
elbow	1
went	1
by	1
very	1
quickly;	1
yet	1
the	1
man	1
with	1
the	1
bad	1
hat,	1
who	1
thought	1
he	1
was	1
God,	1
overtook	1
him.	1
He	1
ran	1
after	1
him	1
and	1
jumped	1
over	1
a	1
bed	1
of	1
geraniums	1
to	1
catch	1
him.	1
"I	1
beg	1
your	1
Majesty's	1
pardon,"	1
he	1
said,	1
with	1
mock	1
humility,	1
"but	1
here	1
is	1
a	1
quarrel	1
which	1
you	1
ought	1
really	1
to	1
judge."	1
Then	1
as	1
he	1
led	1
the	1
heavy,	1
silk-hatted	1
man	1
back	1
towards	1
the	1
group,	1
he	1
caught	1
MacIan's	1
ear	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
whisper:	1
"This	1
poor	1
gentleman	1
is	1
mad;	1
he	1
thinks	1
he	1
is	1
Edward	1
VII."	1
At	1
this	1
the	1
self-appointed	1
Creator	1
slightly	1
winked.	1
"Of	1
course	1
you	1
won't	1
trust	1
him	1
much;	1
come	1
to	1
me	1
for	1
everything.	1
But	1
in	1
my	1
position	1
one	1
has	1
to	1
meet	1
so	1
many	1
people.	1
One	1
has	1
to	1
be	1
broadminded."	1
The	1
big	1
banker	1
in	1
the	1
black	1
frock-coat	1
and	1
hat	1
was	1
standing	1
quite	1
grave	1
and	1
dignified	1
on	1
the	1
lawn,	1
save	1
for	1
his	1
slight	1
twitch	1
of	1
one	1
limb,	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
by	1
any	1
means	1
unworthy	1
of	1
the	1
part	1
which	1
the	1
other	1
promptly	1
forced	1
upon	1
him.	1
"My	1
dear	1
fellow,"	1
said	1
the	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
straw	1
hat,	1
"these	1
two	1
gentlemen	1
are	1
going	1
to	1
fight	1
a	1
duel	1
of	1
the	1
utmost	1
importance.	1
Your	1
own	1
royal	1
position	1
and	1
my	1
much	1
humbler	1
one	1
surely	1
indicate	1
us	1
as	1
the	1
proper	1
seconds.	1
Seconds--yes,	1
seconds----"	1
and	1
here	1
the	1
speaker	1
was	1
once	1
more	1
shaken	1
with	1
his	1
old	1
malady	1
of	1
laughter.	1
"Yes,	1
you	1
and	1
I	1
are	1
both	1
seconds--and	1
these	1
two	1
gentlemen	1
can	1
obviously	1
fight	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
us.	1
You,	1
he-he,	1
are	1
the	1
king.	1
I	1
am	1
God;	1
really,	1
they	1
could	1
hardly	1
have	1
better	1
supporters.	1
They	1
have	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
place."	1
Then	1
Turnbull,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
staring	1
with	1
a	1
frown	1
at	1
the	1
fresh	1
turf,	1
burst	1
out	1
with	1
a	1
rather	1
bitter	1
laugh	1
and	1
cried,	1
throwing	1
his	1
red	1
head	1
in	1
the	1
air:	1
"Yes,	1
by	1
God,	1
MacIan,	1
I	1
think	1
we	1
have	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
place!"	1
And	1
MacIan	1
answered,	1
with	1
an	1
adamantine	1
stupidity:	1
"Any	1
place	1
is	1
the	1
right	1
place	1
where	1
they	1
will	1
let	1
us	1
do	1
it."	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
long	1
stillness,	1
and	1
their	1
eyes	1
involuntarily	1
took	1
in	1
the	1
landscape,	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
taken	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
landscapes	1
of	1
their	1
everlasting	1
combat;	1
the	1
bright,	1
square	1
garden	1
behind	1
the	1
shop;	1
the	1
whole	1
lift	1
and	1
leaning	1
of	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
Hampstead	1
Heath;	1
the	1
little	1
garden	1
of	1
the	1
decadent	1
choked	1
with	1
flowers;	1
the	1
square	1
of	1
sand	1
beside	1
the	1
sea	1
at	1
sunrise.	1
They	1
both	1
felt	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
moment	1
all	1
the	1
breadth	1
and	1
blossoming	1
beauty	1
of	1
that	1
paradise,	1
the	1
coloured	1
trees,	1
the	1
natural	1
and	1
restful	1
nooks	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
great	1
wall	1
of	1
stone--more	1
awful	1
than	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
China--from	1
which	1
no	1
flesh	1
could	1
flee.	1
Turnbull	1
was	1
moodily	1
balancing	1
his	1
sword	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
as	1
the	1
other	1
spoke;	1
then	1
he	1
started,	1
for	1
a	1
mouth	1
whispered	1
quite	1
close	1
to	1
his	1
ear.	1
With	1
a	1
softness	1
incredible	1
in	1
any	1
cat,	1
the	1
huge,	1
heavy	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
black	1
hat	1
and	1
frock-coat	1
had	1
crept	1
across	1
the	1
lawn	1
from	1
his	1
own	1
side	1
and	1
was	1
saying	1
in	1
his	1
ear:	1
"Don't	1
trust	1
that	1
second	1
of	1
yours.	1
He's	1
mad	1
and	1
not	1
so	1
mad,	1
either;	1
for	1
he	1
frightfully	1
cunning	1
and	1
sharp.	1
Don't	1
believe	1
the	1
story	1
he	1
tells	1
you	1
about	1
why	1
I	1
hate	1
him.	1
I	1
know	1
the	1
story	1
he'll	1
tell;	1
I	1
overheard	1
it	1
when	1
the	1
housekeeper	1
was	1
talking	1
to	1
the	1
postman.	1
It's	1
too	1
long	1
to	1
talk	1
about	1
now,	1
and	1
I	1
expect	1
we're	1
watched,	1
but----"	1
Something	1
in	1
Turnbull	1
made	1
him	1
want	1
suddenly	1
to	1
be	1
sick	1
on	1
the	1
grass;	1
the	1
mere	1
healthy	1
and	1
heathen	1
horror	1
of	1
the	1
unclean;	1
the	1
mere	1
inhumane	1
hatred	1
of	1
the	1
inhuman	1
state	1
of	1
madness.	1
He	1
seemed	1
to	1
hear	1
all	1
round	1
him	1
the	1
hateful	1
whispers	1
of	1
that	1
place,	1
innumerable	1
as	1
leaves	1
whispering	1
in	1
the	1
wind,	1
and	1
each	1
of	1
them	1
telling	1
eagerly	1
some	1
evil	1
that	1
had	1
not	1
happened	1
or	1
some	1
terrific	1
secret	1
which	1
was	1
not	1
true.	1
All	1
the	1
rationalist	1
and	1
plain	1
man	1
revolted	1
within	1
him	1
against	1
bowing	1
down	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
in	1
that	1
forest	1
of	1
deception	1
and	1
egotistical	1
darkness.	1
He	1
wanted	1
to	1
blow	1
up	1
that	1
palace	1
of	1
delusions	1
with	1
dynamite;	1
and	1
in	1
some	1
wild	1
way,	1
which	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
defend,	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
do	1
it.	1
He	1
looked	1
across	1
at	1
MacIan	1
and	1
said:	1
"Oh,	1
I	1
can't	1
stand	1
this!"	1
"Can't	1
stand	1
what?"	1
asked	1
his	1
opponent,	1
eyeing	1
him	1
doubtfully.	1
"Shall	1
we	1
say	1
the	1
atmosphere?"	1
replied	1
Turnbull;	1
"one	1
can't	1
use	1
uncivil	1
expressions	1
even	1
to	1
a--deity.	1
The	1
fact	1
is,	1
I	1
don't	1
like	1
having	1
God	1
for	1
my	1
second."	1
"Sir!"	1
said	1
that	1
being	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
great	1
offence,	1
"in	1
my	1
position	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
used	1
to	1
having	1
my	1
favours	1
refused.	1
Do	1
you	1
know	1
who	1
I	1
am?"	1
The	1
editor	1
of	1
_The	1
Atheist_	1
turned	1
upon	1
him	1
like	1
one	1
who	1
has	1
lost	1
all	1
patience,	1
and	1
exploded:	1
"Yes,	1
you	1
are	1
God,	1
aren't	1
you?"	1
he	1
said,	1
abruptly,	1
"why	1
do	1
we	1
have	1
two	1
sets	1
of	1
teeth?"	1
"Teeth?"	1
spluttered	1
the	1
genteel	1
lunatic;	1
"teeth?"	1
"Yes,"	1
cried	1
Turnbull,	1
advancing	1
on	1
him	1
swiftly	1
and	1
with	1
animated	1
gestures,	1
"why	1
does	1
teething	1
hurt?	1
Why	1
do	1
growing	1
pains	1
hurt?	1
Why	1
are	1
measles	1
catching?	1
Why	1
does	1
a	1
rose	1
have	1
thorns?	1
Why	1
do	1
rhinoceroses	1
have	1
horns?	1
Why	1
is	1
the	1
horn	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
nose?	1
Why	1
haven't	1
I	1
a	1
horn	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
my	1
nose,	1
eh?"	1
And	1
he	1
struck	1
the	1
bridge	1
of	1
his	1
nose	1
smartly	1
with	1
his	1
forefinger	1
to	1
indicate	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
omission	1
and	1
then	1
wagged	1
the	1
finger	1
menacingly	1
at	1
the	1
Creator.	1
"I've	1
often	1
wanted	1
to	1
meet	1
you,"	1
he	1
resumed,	1
sternly,	1
after	1
a	1
pause,	1
"to	1
hold	1
you	1
accountable	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
idiocy	1
and	1
cruelty	1
of	1
this	1
muddled	1
and	1
meaningless	1
world	1
of	1
yours.	1
You	1
make	1
a	1
hundred	1
seeds	1
and	1
only	1
one	1
bears	1
fruit.	1
You	1
make	1
a	1
million	1
worlds	1
and	1
only	1
one	1
seems	1
inhabited.	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
mean	1
by	1
it,	1
eh?	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
mean	1
by	1
it?"	1
The	1
unhappy	1
lunatic	1
had	1
fallen	1
back	1
before	1
this	1
quite	1
novel	1
form	1
of	1
attack,	1
and	1
lifted	1
his	1
burnt-out	1
cigarette	1
almost	1
like	1
one	1
warding	1
off	1
a	1
blow.	1
Turnbull	1
went	1
on	1
like	1
a	1
torrent.	1
"A	1
man	1
died	1
yesterday	1
in	1
Ealing.	1
You	1
murdered	1
him.	1
A	1
girl	1
had	1
the	1
toothache	1
in	1
Croydon.	1
You	1
gave	1
it	1
her.	1
Fifty	1
sailors	1
were	1
drowned	1
off	1
Selsey	1
Bill.	1
You	1
scuttled	1
their	1
ship.	1
What	1
have	1
you	1
got	1
to	1
say	1
for	1
yourself,	1
eh?"	1
The	1
representative	1
of	1
omnipotence	1
looked	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
most	1
of	1
these	1
things	1
to	1
his	1
subordinates;	1
he	1
passed	1
a	1
hand	1
over	1
his	1
wrinkling	1
brow	1
and	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
much	1
saner	1
than	1
any	1
he	1
had	1
yet	1
used:	1
"Well,	1
if	1
you	1
dislike	1
my	1
assistance,	1
of	1
course--perhaps	1
the	1
other	1
gentleman----"	1
"The	1
other	1
gentleman,"	1
cried	1
Turnbull,	1
scornfully,	1
"is	1
a	1
submissive	1
and	1
loyal	1
and	1
obedient	1
gentleman.	1
He	1
likes	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
wear	1
crowns,	1
whether	1
of	1
diamonds	1
or	1
of	1
stars.	1
He	1
believes	1
in	1
the	1
divine	1
right	1
of	1
kings,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
appropriate	1
enough	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
have	1
the	1
king	1
for	1
his	1
second.	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
appropriate	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
God	1
for	1
my	1
second.	1
God	1
is	1
not	1
good	1
enough.	1
I	1
dislike	1
and	1
I	1
deny	1
the	1
divine	1
right	1
of	1
kings.	1
But	1
I	1
dislike	1
more	1
and	1
I	1
deny	1
more	1
the	1
divine	1
right	1
of	1
divinity."	1
Then	1
after	1
a	1
pause	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
swallowed	1
his	1
passion,	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
MacIan:	1
"You	1
have	1
got	1
the	1
right	1
second,	1
anyhow."	1
The	1
Highlander	1
did	1
not	1
answer,	1
but	1
stood	1
as	1
if	1
thunderstruck	1
with	1
one	1
long	1
and	1
heavy	1
thought.	1
Then	1
at	1
last	1
he	1
turned	1
abruptly	1
to	1
his	1
second	1
in	1
the	1
silk	1
hat	1
and	1
said:	1
"Who	1
are	1
you?"	1
The	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
silk	1
hat	1
blinked	1
and	1
bridled	1
in	1
affected	1
surprise,	1
like	1
one	1
who	1
was	1
in	1
truth	1
accustomed	1
to	1
be	1
doubted.	1
"I	1
am	1
King	1
Edward	1
VII,"	1
he	1
said,	1
with	1
shaky	1
arrogance.	1
"Do	1
you	1
doubt	1
my	1
word?"	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
doubt	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
least,"	1
answered	1
MacIan.	1
"Then,	1
why,"	1
said	1
the	1
large	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
silk	1
hat,	1
trembling	1
from	1
head	1
to	1
foot,	1
"why	1
do	1
you	1
wear	1
your	1
hat	1
before	1
the	1
king?"	1
"Why	1
should	1
I	1
take	1
it	1
off,"	1
retorted	1
MacIan,	1
with	1
equal	1
heat,	1
"before	1
a	1
usurper?"	1
Turnbull	1
swung	1
round	1
on	1
his	1
heel.	1
"Well,	1
really,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"I	1
thought	1
at	1
least	1
you	1
were	1
a	1
loyal	1
subject."	1
"I	1
am	1
the	1
only	1
loyal	1
subject,"	1
answered	1
the	1
Gael.	1
"For	1
nearly	1
thirty	1
years	1
I	1
have	1
walked	1
these	1
islands	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
found	1
another."	1
"You	1
are	1
always	1
hard	1
to	1
follow,"	1
remarked	1
Turnbull,	1
genially,	1
"and	1
sometimes	1
so	1
much	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
hardly	1
worth	1
following."	1
"I	1
alone	1
am	1
loyal,"	1
insisted	1
MacIan;	1
"for	1
I	1
alone	1
am	1
in	1
rebellion.	1
I	1
am	1
ready	1
at	1
any	1
instant	1
to	1
restore	1
the	1
Stuarts.	1
I	1
am	1
ready	1
at	1
any	1
instant	1
to	1
defy	1
the	1
Hanoverian	1
brood--and	1
I	1
defy	1
it	1
now	1
even	1
when	1
face	1
to	1
face	1
with	1
the	1
actual	1
ruler	1
of	1
the	1
enormous	1
British	1
Empire!"	1
And	1
folding	1
his	1
arms	1
and	1
throwing	1
back	1
his	1
lean,	1
hawklike	1
face,	1
he	1
haughtily	1
confronted	1
the	1
man	1
with	1
the	1
formal	1
frock-coat	1
and	1
the	1
eccentric	1
elbow.	1
"What	1
right	1
had	1
you	1
stunted	1
German	1
squires,"	1
he	1
cried,	1
"to	1
interfere	1
in	1
a	1
quarrel	1
between	1
Scotch	1
and	1
English	1
and	1
Irish	1
gentlemen?	1
Who	1
made	1
you,	1
whose	1
fathers	1
could	1
not	1
splutter	1
English	1
while	1
they	1
walked	1
in	1
Whitehall,	1
who	1
made	1
you	1
the	1
judge	1
between	1
the	1
republic	1
of	1
Sidney	1
and	1
the	1
monarchy	1
of	1
Montrose?	1
What	1
had	1
your	1
sires	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
England	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
have	1
the	1
foul	1
offering	1
of	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
Derwentwater	1
and	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
Jimmy	1
Dawson?	1
Where	1
are	1
the	1
corpses	1
of	1
Culloden?	1
Where	1
is	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
Lochiel?"	1
MacIan	1
advanced	1
upon	1
his	1
opponent	1
with	1
a	1
bony	1
and	1
pointed	1
finger,	1
as	1
if	1
indicating	1
the	1
exact	1
pocket	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
that	1
Cameron	1
was	1
probably	1
kept;	1
and	1
Edward	1
VII	1
fell	1
back	1
a	1
few	1
paces	1
in	1
considerable	1
confusion.	1
"What	1
good	1
have	1
you	1
ever	1
done	1
to	1
us?"	1
he	1
continued	1
in	1
harsher	1
and	1
harsher	1
accents,	1
forcing	1
the	1
other	1
back	1
towards	1
the	1
flower-beds.	1
"What	1
good	1
have	1
you	1
ever	1
done,	1
you	1
race	1
of	1
German	1
sausages?	1
Yards	1
of	1
barbarian	1
etiquette,	1
to	1
throttle	1
the	1
freedom	1
of	1
aristocracy!	1
Gas	1
of	1
northern	1
metaphysics	1
to	1
blow	1
up	1
Broad	1
Church	1
bishops	1
like	1
balloons.	1
Bad	1
pictures	1
and	1
bad	1
manners	1
and	1
pantheism	1
and	1
the	1
Albert	1
Memorial.	1
Go	1
back	1
to	1
Hanover,	1
you	1
humbug?	1
Go	1
to----"	1
Before	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
this	1
tirade	1
the	1
arrogance	1
of	1
the	1
monarch	1
had	1
entirely	1
given	1
way;	1
he	1
had	1
fairly	1
turned	1
tail	1
and	1
was	1
trundling	1
away	1
down	1
the	1
path.	1
MacIan	1
strode	1
after	1
him	1
still	1
preaching	1
and	1
flourishing	1
his	1
large,	1
lean	1
hands.	1
The	1
other	1
two	1
remained	1
in	1
the	1
centre	1
of	1
the	1
lawn--Turnbull	1
in	1
convulsions	1
of	1
laughter,	1
the	1
lunatic	1
in	1
convulsions	1
of	1
disgust.	1
Almost	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
moment	1
a	1
third	1
figure	1
came	1
stepping	1
swiftly	1
across	1
the	1
lawn.	1
The	1
advancing	1
figure	1
walked	1
with	1
a	1
stoop,	1
and	1
yet	1
somehow	1
flung	1
his	1
forked	1
and	1
narrow	1
beard	1
forward.	1
That	1
carefully	1
cut	1
and	1
pointed	1
yellow	1
beard	1
was,	1
indeed,	1
the	1
most	1
emphatic	1
thing	1
about	1
him.	1
When	1
he	1
clasped	1
his	1
hands	1
behind	1
him,	1
under	1
the	1
tails	1
of	1
his	1
coat,	1
he	1
would	1
wag	1
his	1
beard	1
at	1
a	1
man	1
like	1
a	1
big	1
forefinger.	1
It	1
performed	1
almost	1
all	1
his	1
gestures;	1
it	1
was	1
more	1
important	1
than	1
the	1
glittering	1
eye-glasses	1
through	1
which	1
he	1
looked	1
or	1
the	1
beautiful	1
bleating	1
voice	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
spoke.	1
His	1
face	1
and	1
neck	1
were	1
of	1
a	1
lusty	1
red,	1
but	1
lean	1
and	1
stringy;	1
he	1
always	1
wore	1
his	1
expensive	1
gold-rim	1
eye-glasses	1
slightly	1
askew	1
upon	1
his	1
aquiline	1
nose;	1
and	1
he	1
always	1
showed	1
two	1
gleaming	1
foreteeth	1
under	1
his	1
moustache,	1
in	1
a	1
smile	1
so	1
perpetual	1
as	1
to	1
earn	1
the	1
reputation	1
of	1
a	1
sneer.	1
But	1
for	1
the	1
crooked	1
glasses	1
his	1
dress	1
was	1
always	1
exquisite;	1
and	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
smile	1
he	1
was	1
perfectly	1
and	1
perennially	1
depressed.	1
"Don't	1
you	1
think,"	1
said	1
the	1
new-comer,	1
with	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
supercilious	1
entreaty,	1
"that	1
we	1
had	1
better	1
all	1
come	1
into	1
breakfast?	1
It	1
is	1
such	1
a	1
mistake	1
to	1
wait	1
for	1
breakfast.	1
It	1
spoils	1
one's	1
temper	1
so	1
much."	1
"Quite	1
so,"	1
replied	1
Turnbull,	1
seriously.	1
"There	1
seems	1
almost	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
little	1
quarrelling	1
here,"	1
said	1
the	1
man	1
with	1
the	1
goatish	1
beard.	1
"It	1
is	1
rather	1
a	1
long	1
story,"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
smiling.	1
"Originally,	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
called	1
a	1
phase	1
in	1
the	1
quarrel	1
between	1
science	1
and	1
religion."	1
The	1
new-comer	1
started	1
slightly,	1
and	1
Turnbull	1
replied	1
to	1
the	1
question	1
on	1
his	1
face.	1
"Oh,	1
yes,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"I	1
am	1
science!"	1
"I	1
congratulate	1
you	1
heartily,"	1
answered	1
the	1
other,	1
"I	1
am	1
Doctor	1
Quayle."	1
Turnbull's	1
eyes	1
did	1
not	1
move,	1
but	1
he	1
realized	1
that	1
the	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
panama	1
hat	1
had	1
lost	1
all	1
his	1
ease	1
of	1
a	1
landed	1
proprietor	1
and	1
had	1
withdrawn	1
to	1
a	1
distance	1
of	1
thirty	1
yards,	1
where	1
he	1
stood	1
glaring	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
contraction	1
of	1
fear	1
and	1
hatred	1
that	1
can	1
stiffen	1
a	1
cat.	1

MacIan	1
was	1
sitting	1
somewhat	1
disconsolately	1
on	1
a	1
stump	1
of	1
tree,	1
his	1
large	1
black	1
head	1
half	1
buried	1
in	1
his	1
large	1
brown	1
hands,	1
when	1
Turnbull	1
strode	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
chewing	1
a	1
cigarette.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
look	1
up,	1
but	1
his	1
comrade	1
and	1
enemy	1
addressed	1
him	1
like	1
one	1
who	1
must	1
free	1
himself	1
of	1
his	1
feelings.	1
"Well,	1
I	1
hope,	1
at	1
any	1
rate,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"that	1
you	1
like	1
your	1
precious	1
religion	1
now.	1
I	1
hope	1
you	1
like	1
the	1
society	1
of	1
this	1
poor	1
devil	1
whom	1
your	1
damned	1
tracts	1
and	1
hymns	1
and	1
priests	1
have	1
driven	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
wits.	1
Five	1
men	1
in	1
this	1
place,	1
they	1
tell	1
me,	1
five	1
men	1
in	1
this	1
place	1
who	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
fathers	1
of	1
families,	1
and	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
thinks	1
he	1
is	1
God	1
the	1
Father.	1
Oh!	1
you	1
may	1
talk	1
about	1
the	1
ugliness	1
of	1
science,	1
but	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
one	1
here	1
who	1
thinks	1
he	1
is	1
Protoplasm."	1
"They	1
naturally	1
prefer	1
a	1
bright	1
part,"	1
said	1
MacIan,	1
wearily.	1
"Protoplasm	1
is	1
not	1
worth	1
going	1
mad	1
about."	1
"At	1
least,"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
savagely,	1
"it	1
was	1
your	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
who	1
started	1
all	1
this	1
bosh	1
about	1
being	1
God."	1
For	1
one	1
instant	1
MacIan	1
opened	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
battle;	1
then	1
his	1
tightened	1
lips	1
took	1
a	1
crooked	1
smile	1
and	1
he	1
said,	1
quite	1
calmly:	1
"No,	1
the	1
idea	1
is	1
older;	1
it	1
was	1
Satan	1
who	1
first	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
God."	1
"Then,	1
what,"	1
asked	1
Turnbull,	1
very	1
slowly,	1
as	1
he	1
softly	1
picked	1
a	1
flower,	1
"what	1
is	1
the	1
difference	1
between	1
Christ	1
and	1
Satan?"	1
"It	1
is	1
quite	1
simple,"	1
replied	1
the	1
Highlander.	1
"Christ	1
descended	1
into	1
hell;	1
Satan	1
fell	1
into	1
it."	1
"Does	1
it	1
make	1
much	1
odds?"	1
asked	1
the	1
free-thinker.	1
"It	1
makes	1
all	1
the	1
odds,"	1
said	1
the	1
other.	1
"One	1
of	1
them	1
wanted	1
to	1
go	1
up	1
and	1
went	1
down;	1
the	1
other	1
wanted	1
to	1
go	1
down	1
and	1
went	1
up.	1
A	1
god	1
can	1
be	1
humble,	1
a	1
devil	1
can	1
only	1
be	1
humbled."	1
"Why	1
are	1
you	1
always	1
wanting	1
to	1
humble	1
a	1
man?"	1
asked	1
Turnbull,	1
knitting	1
his	1
brows.	1
"It	1
affects	1
me	1
as	1
ungenerous."	1
"Why	1
were	1
you	1
wanting	1
to	1
humble	1
a	1
god	1
when	1
you	1
found	1
him	1
in	1
this	1
garden?"	1
asked	1
MacIan.	1
"That	1
was	1
an	1
extreme	1
case	1
of	1
impudence,"	1
said	1
Turnbull.	1
"Granting	1
the	1
man	1
his	1
almighty	1
pretensions,	1
I	1
think	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
modest,"	1
said	1
MacIan.	1
"It	1
is	1
we	1
who	1
are	1
arrogant,	1
who	1
know	1
we	1
are	1
only	1
men.	1
The	1
ordinary	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
street	1
is	1
more	1
of	1
a	1
monster	1
than	1
that	1
poor	1
fellow;	1
for	1
the	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
street	1
treats	1
himself	1
as	1
God	1
Almighty	1
when	1
he	1
knows	1
he	1
isn't.	1
He	1
expects	1
the	1
universe	1
to	1
turn	1
round	1
him,	1
though	1
he	1
knows	1
he	1
isn't	1
the	1
centre."	1
"Well,"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
sitting	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
grass,	1
"this	1
is	1
a	1
digression,	1
anyhow.	1
What	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
point	1
out	1
is,	1
that	1
your	1
faith	1
does	1
end	1
in	1
asylums	1
and	1
my	1
science	1
doesn't."	1
"Doesn't	1
it,	1
by	1
George!"	1
cried	1
MacIan,	1
scornfully.	1
"There	1
are	1
a	1
few	1
men	1
here	1
who	1
are	1
mad	1
on	1
God	1
and	1
a	1
few	1
who	1
are	1
mad	1
on	1
the	1
Bible.	1
But	1
I	1
bet	1
there	1
are	1
many	1
more	1
who	1
are	1
simply	1
mad	1
on	1
madness."	1
"Do	1
you	1
really	1
believe	1
it?"	1
asked	1
the	1
other.	1
"Scores	1
of	1
them,	1
I	1
should	1
say,"	1
answered	1
MacIan.	1
"Fellows	1
who	1
have	1
read	1
medical	1
books	1
or	1
fellows	1
whose	1
fathers	1
and	1
uncles	1
had	1
something	1
hereditary	1
in	1
their	1
heads--the	1
whole	1
air	1
they	1
breathe	1
is	1
mad."	1
"All	1
the	1
same,"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
shrewdly,	1
"I	1
bet	1
you	1
haven't	1
found	1
a	1
madman	1
of	1
that	1
sort."	1
"I	1
bet	1
I	1
have!"	1
cried	1
Evan,	1
with	1
unusual	1
animation.	1
"I've	1
been	1
walking	1
about	1
the	1
garden	1
talking	1
to	1
a	1
poor	1
chap	1
all	1
the	1
morning.	1
He's	1
simply	1
been	1
broken	1
down	1
and	1
driven	1
raving	1
by	1
your	1
damned	1
science.	1
Talk	1
about	1
believing	1
one	1
is	1
God--why,	1
it's	1
quite	1
an	1
old,	1
comfortable,	1
fireside	1
fancy	1
compared	1
with	1
the	1
sort	1
of	1
things	1
this	1
fellow	1
believes.	1
He	1
believes	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
God,	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
better	1
than	1
God.	1
He	1
says	1
God	1
will	1
be	1
afraid	1
to	1
face	1
him.	1
He	1
says	1
one	1
is	1
always	1
progressing	1
beyond	1
the	1
best.	1
He	1
put	1
his	1
arm	1
in	1
mine	1
and	1
whispered	1
in	1
my	1
ear,	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
the	1
apocalypse:	1
'Never	1
trust	1
a	1
God	1
that	1
you	1
can't	1
improve	1
on.'"	1
"What	1
can	1
he	1
have	1
meant?"	1
said	1
the	1
atheist,	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
logic	1
awake.	1
"Obviously	1
one	1
should	1
not	1
trust	1
any	1
God	1
that	1
one	1
can	1
improve	1
on."	1
"It	1
is	1
the	1
way	1
he	1
talks,"	1
said	1
MacIan,	1
almost	1
indifferently;	1
"but	1
he	1
says	1
rummier	1
things	1
than	1
that.	1
He	1
says	1
that	1
a	1
man's	1
doctor	1
ought	1
to	1
decide	1
what	1
woman	1
he	1
marries;	1
and	1
he	1
says	1
that	1
children	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
brought	1
up	1
by	1
their	1
parents,	1
because	1
a	1
physical	1
partiality	1
will	1
then	1
distort	1
the	1
judgement	1
of	1
the	1
educator."	1
"Oh,	1
dear!"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
laughing,	1
"you	1
have	1
certainly	1
come	1
across	1
a	1
pretty	1
bad	1
case,	1
and	1
incidentally	1
proved	1
your	1
own.	1
I	1
suppose	1
some	1
men	1
do	1
lose	1
their	1
wits	1
through	1
science	1
as	1
through	1
love	1
and	1
other	1
good	1
things."	1
"And	1
he	1
says,"	1
went	1
on	1
MacIan,	1
monotonously,	1
"that	1
he	1
cannot	1
see	1
why	1
anyone	1
should	1
suppose	1
that	1
a	1
triangle	1
is	1
a	1
three-sided	1
figure.	1
He	1
says	1
that	1
on	1
some	1
higher	1
plane----"	1
Turnbull	1
leapt	1
to	1
his	1
feet	1
as	1
by	1
an	1
electric	1
shock.	1
"I	1
never	1
could	1
have	1
believed,"	1
he	1
cried,	1
"that	1
you	1
had	1
humour	1
enough	1
to	1
tell	1
a	1
lie.	1
You've	1
gone	1
a	1
bit	1
too	1
far,	1
old	1
man,	1
with	1
your	1
little	1
joke.	1
Even	1
in	1
a	1
lunatic	1
asylum	1
there	1
can't	1
be	1
anybody	1
who,	1
having	1
thought	1
about	1
the	1
matter,	1
thinks	1
that	1
a	1
triangle	1
has	1
not	1
got	1
three	1
sides.	1
If	1
he	1
exists	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
new	1
era	1
in	1
human	1
psychology.	1
But	1
he	1
doesn't	1
exist."	1
"I	1
will	1
go	1
and	1
fetch	1
him,"	1
said	1
MacIan,	1
calmly;	1
"I	1
left	1
the	1
poor	1
fellow	1
wandering	1
about	1
by	1
the	1
nasturtium	1
bed."	1
MacIan	1
vanished,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
moments	1
returned,	1
trailing	1
with	1
him	1
his	1
own	1
discovery	1
among	1
lunatics,	1
who	1
was	1
a	1
slender	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
fixed	1
smile	1
and	1
an	1
unfixed	1
and	1
rolling	1
head.	1
He	1
had	1
a	1
goatlike	1
beard	1
just	1
long	1
enough	1
to	1
be	1
shaken	1
in	1
a	1
strong	1
wind.	1
Turnbull	1
sprang	1
to	1
his	1
feet	1
and	1
was	1
like	1
one	1
who	1
is	1
speechless	1
through	1
choking	1
a	1
sudden	1
shout	1
of	1
laughter.	1
"Why,	1
you	1
great	1
donkey,"	1
he	1
shouted,	1
in	1
an	1
ear-shattering	1
whisper,	1
"that's	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
patients	1
at	1
all.	1
That's	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
doctors."	1
Evan	1
looked	1
back	1
at	1
the	1
leering	1
head	1
with	1
the	1
long-pointed	1
beard	1
and	1
repeated	1
the	1
word	1
inquiringly:	1
"One	1
of	1
the	1
doctors?"	1
"Oh,	1
you	1
know	1
what	1
I	1
mean,"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
impatiently.	1
"The	1
medical	1
authorities	1
of	1
the	1
place."	1
Evan	1
was	1
still	1
staring	1
back	1
curiously	1
at	1
the	1
beaming	1
and	1
bearded	1
creature	1
behind	1
him.	1
"The	1
mad	1
doctors,"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
shortly.	1
"Quite	1
so,"	1
said	1
MacIan.	1
After	1
a	1
rather	1
restless	1
silence	1
Turnbull	1
plucked	1
MacIan	1
by	1
the	1
elbow	1
and	1
pulled	1
him	1
aside.	1
"For	1
goodness	1
sake,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"don't	1
offend	1
this	1
fellow;	1
he	1
may	1
be	1
as	1
mad	1
as	1
ten	1
hatters,	1
if	1
you	1
like,	1
but	1
he	1
has	1
us	1
between	1
his	1
finger	1
and	1
thumb.	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
very	1
time	1
he	1
appointed	1
to	1
talk	1
with	1
us	1
about	1
our--well,	1
our	1
exeat."	1
"But	1
what	1
can	1
it	1
matter?"	1
asked	1
the	1
wondering	1
MacIan.	1
"He	1
can't	1
keep	1
us	1
in	1
the	1
asylum.	1
We're	1
not	1
mad."	1
"Jackass!"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
heartily,	1
"of	1
course	1
we're	1
not	1
mad.	1
Of	1
course,	1
if	1
we	1
are	1
medically	1
examined	1
and	1
the	1
thing	1
is	1
thrashed	1
out,	1
they	1
will	1
find	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
mad.	1
But	1
don't	1
you	1
see	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
thing	1
is	1
thrashed	1
out	1
it	1
will	1
mean	1
letters	1
to	1
this	1
reference	1
and	1
telegrams	1
to	1
that;	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
word	1
of	1
who	1
we	1
are,	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
taken	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
madhouse,	1
where	1
we	1
may	1
smoke,	1
to	1
a	1
jail,	1
where	1
we	1
mayn't.	1
No,	1
if	1
we	1
manage	1
this	1
very	1
quietly,	1
he	1
may	1
merely	1
let	1
us	1
out	1
at	1
the	1
front	1
door	1
as	1
stray	1
revellers.	1
If	1
there's	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
of	1
inquiry,	1
we	1
are	1
cooked."	1
MacIan	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
grass	1
frowningly	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
seconds,	1
and	1
then	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
new,	1
small	1
and	1
childish	1
voice:	1
"I	1
am	1
awfully	1
stupid,	1
Mr.	1
Turnbull;	1
you	1
must	1
be	1
patient	1
with	1
me."	1
Turnbull	1
caught	1
Evan's	1
elbow	1
again	1
with	1
quite	1
another	1
gesture.	1
"Come,"	1
he	1
cried,	1
with	1
the	1
harsh	1
voice	1
of	1
one	1
who	1
hides	1
emotion,	1
"come	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
be	1
tactful	1
in	1
chorus."	1
The	1
doctor	1
with	1
the	1
pointed	1
beard	1
was	1
already	1
slanting	1
it	1
forward	1
at	1
a	1
more	1
than	1
usually	1
acute	1
angle,	1
with	1
the	1
smile	1
that	1
expressed	1
expectancy.	1
"I	1
hope	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
hurry	1
you,	1
gentlemen,"	1
he	1
said,	1
with	1
the	1
faintest	1
suggestion	1
of	1
a	1
sneer	1
at	1
their	1
hurried	1
consultation,	1
"but	1
I	1
believe	1
you	1
wanted	1
to	1
see	1
me	1
at	1
half	1
past	1
eleven."	1
"I	1
am	1
most	1
awfully	1
sorry,	1
Doctor,"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
with	1
ready	1
amiability;	1
"I	1
never	1
meant	1
to	1
keep	1
you	1
waiting;	1
but	1
the	1
silly	1
accident	1
that	1
has	1
landed	1
us	1
in	1
your	1
garden	1
may	1
have	1
some	1
rather	1
serious	1
consequences	1
to	1
our	1
friends	1
elsewhere,	1
and	1
my	1
friend	1
here	1
was	1
just	1
drawing	1
my	1
attention	1
to	1
some	1
of	1
them."	1
"Quite	1
so!	1
Quite	1
so!"	1
said	1
the	1
doctor,	1
hurriedly.	1
"If	1
you	1
really	1
want	1
to	1
put	1
anything	1
before	1
me,	1
I	1
can	1
give	1
you	1
a	1
few	1
moments	1
in	1
my	1
consulting-room."	1
He	1
led	1
them	1
rapidly	1
into	1
a	1
small	1
but	1
imposing	1
apartment,	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
built	1
and	1
furnished	1
entirely	1
in	1
red-varnished	1
wood.	1
There	1
was	1
one	1
desk	1
occupied	1
with	1
carefully	1
docketed	1
papers;	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
several	1
chairs	1
of	1
the	1
red-varnished	1
wood--though	1
of	1
different	1
shape.	1
All	1
along	1
the	1
wall	1
ran	1
something	1
that	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
bookcase,	1
only	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
filled	1
with	1
books,	1
but	1
with	1
flat,	1
oblong	1
slabs	1
or	1
cases	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
polished	1
dark-red	1
consistency.	1
What	1
those	1
flat	1
wooden	1
cases	1
were	1
they	1
could	1
form	1
no	1
conception.	1
The	1
doctor	1
sat	1
down	1
with	1
a	1
polite	1
impatience	1
on	1
his	1
professional	1
perch;	1
MacIan	1
remained	1
standing,	1
but	1
Turnbull	1
threw	1
himself	1
almost	1
with	1
luxury	1
into	1
a	1
hard	1
wooden	1
arm-chair.	1
"This	1
is	1
a	1
most	1
absurd	1
business,	1
Doctor,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"and	1
I	1
am	1
ashamed	1
to	1
take	1
up	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
busy	1
professional	1
men	1
with	1
such	1
pranks	1
from	1
outside.	1
The	1
plain	1
fact	1
is,	1
that	1
he	1
and	1
I	1
and	1
a	1
pack	1
of	1
silly	1
men	1
and	1
girls	1
have	1
organized	1
a	1
game	1
across	1
this	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
country--a	1
sort	1
of	1
combination	1
of	1
hare	1
and	1
hounds	1
and	1
hide	1
and	1
seek--I	1
dare	1
say	1
you've	1
heard	1
of	1
it.	1
We	1
are	1
the	1
hares,	1
and,	1
seeing	1
your	1
high	1
wall	1
look	1
so	1
inviting,	1
we	1
tumbled	1
over	1
it,	1
and	1
naturally	1
were	1
a	1
little	1
startled	1
with	1
what	1
we	1
found	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side."	1
"Quite	1
so!"	1
said	1
the	1
doctor,	1
mildly.	1
"I	1
can	1
understand	1
that	1
you	1
were	1
startled."	1
Turnbull	1
had	1
expected	1
him	1
to	1
ask	1
what	1
place	1
was	1
the	1
headquarters	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
exhilarating	1
game,	1
and	1
who	1
were	1
the	1
male	1
and	1
female	1
enthusiasts	1
who	1
had	1
brought	1
it	1
to	1
such	1
perfection;	1
in	1
fact,	1
Turnbull	1
was	1
busy	1
making	1
up	1
these	1
personal	1
and	1
topographical	1
particulars.	1
As	1
the	1
doctor	1
did	1
not	1
ask	1
the	1
question,	1
he	1
grew	1
slightly	1
uneasy,	1
and	1
risked	1
the	1
question:	1
"I	1
hope	1
you	1
will	1
accept	1
my	1
assurance	1
that	1
the	1
thing	1
was	1
an	1
accident	1
and	1
that	1
no	1
intrusion	1
was	1
meant."	1
"Oh,	1
yes,	1
sir,"	1
replied	1
the	1
doctor,	1
smiling,	1
"I	1
accept	1
everything	1
that	1
you	1
say."	1
"In	1
that	1
case,"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
rising	1
genially,	1
"we	1
must	1
not	1
further	1
interrupt	1
your	1
important	1
duties.	1
I	1
suppose	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
someone	1
to	1
let	1
us	1
out?"	1
"No,"	1
said	1
the	1
doctor,	1
still	1
smiling	1
steadily	1
and	1
pleasantly,	1
"there	1
will	1
be	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
let	1
you	1
out."	1
"Can	1
we	1
let	1
ourselves	1
out,	1
then?"	1
asked	1
Turnbull,	1
in	1
some	1
surprise.	1
"Why,	1
of	1
course	1
not,"	1
said	1
the	1
beaming	1
scientist;	1
"think	1
how	1
dangerous	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
in	1
a	1
place	1
like	1
this."	1
"Then,	1
how	1
the	1
devil	1
are	1
we	1
to	1
get	1
out?"	1
cried	1
Turnbull,	1
losing	1
his	1
manners	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time.	1
"It	1
is	1
a	1
question	1
of	1
time,	1
of	1
receptivity,	1
and	1
treatment,"	1
said	1
the	1
doctor,	1
arching	1
his	1
eyebrows	1
indifferently.	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
regard	1
either	1
of	1
your	1
cases	1
as	1
incurable."	1
And	1
with	1
that	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
was	1
struck	1
dumb,	1
and,	1
as	1
in	1
all	1
intolerable	1
moments,	1
the	1
word	1
was	1
with	1
the	1
unworldly.	1
MacIan	1
took	1
one	1
stride	1
to	1
the	1
table,	1
leant	1
across	1
it,	1
and	1
said:	1
"We	1
can't	1
stop	1
here,	1
we're	1
not	1
mad	1
people!"	1
"We	1
don't	1
use	1
the	1
crude	1
phrase,"	1
said	1
the	1
doctor,	1
smiling	1
at	1
his	1
patent-leather	1
boots.	1
"But	1
you	1
_can't_	1
think	1
us	1
mad,"	1
thundered	1
MacIan.	1
"You	1
never	1
saw	1
us	1
before.	1
You	1
know	1
nothing	1
about	1
us.	1
You	1
haven't	1
even	1
examined	1
us."	1
The	1
doctor	1
threw	1
back	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
beard.	1
"Oh,	1
yes,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"very	1
thoroughly."	1
"But	1
you	1
can't	1
shut	1
a	1
man	1
up	1
on	1
your	1
mere	1
impressions	1
without	1
documents	1
or	1
certificates	1
or	1
anything?"	1
The	1
doctor	1
got	1
languidly	1
to	1
his	1
feet.	1
"Quite	1
so,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"You	1
certainly	1
ought	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
documents."	1
He	1
went	1
across	1
to	1
the	1
curious	1
mock	1
book-shelves	1
and	1
took	1
down	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
flat	1
mahogany	1
cases.	1
This	1
he	1
opened	1
with	1
a	1
curious	1
key	1
at	1
his	1
watch-chain,	1
and	1
laying	1
back	1
a	1
flap	1
revealed	1
a	1
quire	1
of	1
foolscap	1
covered	1
with	1
close	1
but	1
quite	1
clear	1
writing.	1
The	1
first	1
three	1
words	1
were	1
in	1
such	1
large	1
copy-book	1
hand	1
that	1
they	1
caught	1
the	1
eye	1
even	1
at	1
a	1
distance.	1
They	1
were:	1
"MacIan,	1
Evan	1
Stuart."	1
Evan	1
bent	1
his	1
angry	1
eagle	1
face	1
over	1
it;	1
yet	1
something	1
blurred	1
it	1
and	1
he	1
could	1
never	1
swear	1
he	1
saw	1
it	1
distinctly.	1
He	1
saw	1
something	1
that	1
began:	1
"Prenatal	1
influences	1
predisposing	1
to	1
mania.	1
Grandfather	1
believed	1
in	1
return	1
of	1
the	1
Stuarts.	1
Mother	1
carried	1
bone	1
of	1
St.	1
Eulalia	1
with	1
which	1
she	1
touched	1
children	1
in	1
sickness.	1
Marked	1
religious	1
mania	1
at	1
early	1
age----"	1
Evan	1
fell	1
back	1
and	1
fought	1
for	1
his	1
speech.	1
"Oh!"	1
he	1
burst	1
out	1
at	1
last.	1
"Oh!	1
if	1
all	1
this	1
world	1
I	1
have	1
walked	1
in	1
had	1
been	1
as	1
sane	1
as	1
my	1
mother	1
was."	1
Then	1
he	1
compressed	1
his	1
temples	1
with	1
his	1
hands,	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
crush	1
them.	1
And	1
then	1
lifted	1
suddenly	1
a	1
face	1
that	1
looked	1
fresh	1
and	1
young,	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
dipped	1
and	1
washed	1
it	1
in	1
some	1
holy	1
well.	1
"Very	1
well,"	1
he	1
cried;	1
"I	1
will	1
take	1
the	1
sour	1
with	1
the	1
sweet.	1
I	1
will	1
pay	1
the	1
penalty	1
of	1
having	1
enjoyed	1
God	1
in	1
this	1
monstrous	1
modern	1
earth	1
that	1
cannot	1
enjoy	1
man	1
or	1
beast.	1
I	1
will	1
die	1
happy	1
in	1
your	1
madhouse,	1
only	1
because	1
I	1
know	1
what	1
I	1
know.	1
Let	1
it	1
be	1
granted,	1
then--MacIan	1
is	1
a	1
mystic;	1
MacIan	1
is	1
a	1
maniac.	1
But	1
this	1
honest	1
shopkeeper	1
and	1
editor	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
dragged	1
on	1
my	1
inhuman	1
escapades,	1
you	1
cannot	1
keep	1
him.	1
He	1
will	1
go	1
free,	1
thank	1
God,	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
down	1
in	1
any	1
damned	1
document.	1
His	1
ancestor,	1
I	1
am	1
certain,	1
did	1
not	1
die	1
at	1
Culloden.	1
His	1
mother,	1
I	1
swear,	1
had	1
no	1
relics.	1
Let	1
my	1
friend	1
out	1
of	1
your	1
front	1
door,	1
and	1
as	1
for	1
me----"	1
The	1
doctor	1
had	1
already	1
gone	1
across	1
to	1
the	1
laden	1
shelves,	1
and	1
after	1
a	1
few	1
minutes'	1
short-sighted	1
peering,	1
had	1
pulled	1
down	1
another	1
parallelogram	1
of	1
dark-red	1
wood.	1
This	1
also	1
he	1
unlocked	1
on	1
the	1
table,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
unerring	1
egotistic	1
eye	1
on	1
of	1
the	1
company	1
saw	1
the	1
words,	1
written	1
in	1
large	1
letters:	1
"Turnbull,	1
James."	1
Hitherto	1
Turnbull	1
himself	1
had	1
somewhat	1
scornfully	1
surrendered	1
his	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
business;	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
too	1
honest	1
and	1
unaffected	1
not	1
to	1
start	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
name.	1
After	1
the	1
name,	1
the	1
inscription	1
appeared	1
to	1
run:	1
"Unique	1
case	1
of	1
Eleutheromania.	1
Parentage,	1
as	1
so	1
often	1
in	1
such	1
cases,	1
prosaic	1
and	1
healthy.	1
Eleutheromaniac	1
signs	1
occurred	1
early,	1
however,	1
leading	1
him	1
to	1
attach	1
himself	1
to	1
the	1
individualist	1
Bradlaugh.	1
Recent	1
outbreak	1
of	1
pure	1
anarchy----"	1
Turnbull	1
slammed	1
the	1
case	1
to,	1
almost	1
smashing	1
it,	1
and	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
burst	1
of	1
savage	1
laughter:	1
"Oh!	1
come	1
along,	1
MacIan;	1
I	1
don't	1
care	1
so	1
much,	1
even	1
about	1
getting	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
madhouse,	1
if	1
only	1
we	1
get	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
room.	1
You	1
were	1
right	1
enough,	1
MacIan,	1
when	1
you	1
spoke	1
about--about	1
mad	1
doctors."	1
Somehow	1
they	1
found	1
themselves	1
outside	1
in	1
the	1
cool,	1
green	1
garden,	1
and	1
then,	1
after	1
a	1
stunned	1
silence,	1
Turnbull	1
said:	1
"There	1
is	1
one	1
thing	1
that	1
was	1
puzzling	1
me	1
all	1
the	1
time,	1
and	1
I	1
understand	1
it	1
now."	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
mean?"	1
asked	1
Evan.	1
"No	1
man	1
by	1
will	1
or	1
wit,"	1
answered	1
Turnbull,	1
"can	1
get	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
garden;	1
and	1
yet	1
we	1
got	1
into	1
it	1
merely	1
by	1
jumping	1
over	1
a	1
garden	1
wall.	1
The	1
whole	1
thing	1
explains	1
itself	1
easily	1
enough.	1
That	1
undefended	1
wall	1
was	1
an	1
open	1
trap.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
trap	1
laid	1
for	1
two	1
celebrated	1
lunatics.	1
They	1
saw	1
us	1
get	1
in	1
right	1
enough.	1
And	1
they	1
will	1
see	1
that	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
get	1
out."	1
Evan	1
gazed	1
at	1
the	1
garden	1
wall,	1
gravely	1
for	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
minute,	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
nodded	1
without	1
a	1
word.	1
XV.	1
THE	1
DREAM	1
OF	1
MACIAN	1
The	1
system	1
of	1
espionage	1
in	1
the	1
asylum	1
was	1
so	1
effective	1
and	1
complete	1
that	1
in	1
practice	1
the	1
patients	1
could	1
often	1
enjoy	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
almost	1
complete	1
solitude.	1
They	1
could	1
stray	1
up	1
so	1
near	1
to	1
the	1
wall	1
in	1
an	1
apparently	1
unwatched	1
garden	1
as	1
to	1
find	1
it	1
easy	1
to	1
jump	1
over	1
it.	1
They	1
would	1
only	1
have	1
found	1
the	1
error	1
of	1
their	1
calculations	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
tried	1
to	1
jump.	1
Under	1
this	1
insulting	1
liberty,	1
in	1
this	1
artificial	1
loneliness,	1
Evan	1
MacIan	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
habit	1
of	1
creeping	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
garden	1
after	1
dark--especially	1
upon	1
moonlight	1
nights.	1
The	1
moon,	1
indeed,	1
was	1
for	1
him	1
always	1
a	1
positive	1
magnet	1
in	1
a	1
manner	1
somewhat	1
hard	1
to	1
explain	1
to	1
those	1
of	1
a	1
robuster	1
attitude.	1
Evidently,	1
Apollo	1
is	1
to	1
the	1
full	1
as	1
poetical	1
as	1
Diana;	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
question	1
of	1
poetry	1
in	1
the	1
matured	1
and	1
intellectual	1
sense	1
of	1
the	1
word.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
question	1
of	1
a	1
certain	1
solid	1
and	1
childish	1
fancy.	1
The	1
sun	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
strict	1
and	1
literal	1
sense	1
invisible;	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
that	1
by	1
our	1
bodily	1
eyes	1
it	1
cannot	1
properly	1
be	1
seen.	1
But	1
the	1
moon	1
is	1
a	1
much	1
simpler	1
thing;	1
a	1
naked	1
and	1
nursery	1
sort	1
of	1
thing.	1
It	1
hangs	1
in	1
the	1
sky	1
quite	1
solid	1
and	1
quite	1
silver	1
and	1
quite	1
useless;	1
it	1
is	1
one	1
huge	1
celestial	1
snowball.	1
It	1
was	1
at	1
least	1
some	1
such	1
infantile	1
facts	1
and	1
fancies	1
which	1
led	1
Evan	1
again	1
and	1
again	1
during	1
his	1
dehumanized	1
imprisonment	1
to	1
go	1
out	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
shoot	1
the	1
moon.	1
He	1
was	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
garden	1
on	1
one	1
such	1
luminous	1
and	1
ghostly	1
night,	1
when	1
the	1
steady	1
moonshine	1
toned	1
down	1
all	1
the	1
colours	1
of	1
the	1
garden	1
until	1
almost	1
the	1
strongest	1
tints	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
were	1
the	1
strong	1
soft	1
blue	1
of	1
the	1
sky	1
and	1
the	1
large	1
lemon	1
moon.	1
He	1
was	1
walking	1
with	1
his	1
face	1
turned	1
up	1
to	1
it	1
in	1
that	1
rather	1
half-witted	1
fashion	1
which	1
might	1
have	1
excused	1
the	1
error	1
of	1
his	1
keepers;	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
gazed	1
he	1
became	1
aware	1
of	1
something	1
little	1
and	1
lustrous	1
flying	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
lustrous	1
orb,	1
like	1
a	1
bright	1
chip	1
knocked	1
off	1
the	1
moon.	1
At	1
first	1
he	1
thought	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
mere	1
sparkle	1
or	1
refraction	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
eyesight;	1
he	1
blinked	1
and	1
cleared	1
his	1
eyes.	1
Then	1
he	1
thought	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
falling	1
star;	1
only	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
fall.	1
It	1
jerked	1
awkwardly	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
unknown	1
among	1
meteors	1
and	1
strangely	1
reminiscent	1
of	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
man.	1
The	1
next	1
moment	1
the	1
thing	1
drove	1
right	1
across	1
the	1
moon,	1
and	1
from	1
being	1
silver	1
upon	1
blue,	1
suddenly	1
became	1
black	1
upon	1
silver;	1
then	1
although	1
it	1
passed	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
light	1
in	1
a	1
flash	1
its	1
outline	1
was	1
unmistakable	1
though	1
eccentric.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
flying	1
ship.	1
The	1
vessel	1
took	1
one	1
long	1
and	1
sweeping	1
curve	1
across	1
the	1
sky	1
and	1
came	1
nearer	1
and	1
nearer	1
to	1
MacIan,	1
like	1
a	1
steam-engine	1
coming	1
round	1
a	1
bend.	1
It	1
was	1
of	1
pure	1
white	1
steel,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
moon	1
it	1
gleamed	1
like	1
the	1
armour	1
of	1
Sir	1
Galahad.	1
The	1
simile	1
of	1
such	1
virginity	1
is	1
not	1
inappropriate;	1
for,	1
as	1
it	1
grew	1
larger	1
and	1
larger	1
and	1
lower	1
and	1
lower,	1
Evan	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
only	1
figure	1
in	1
it	1
was	1
robed	1
in	1
white	1
from	1
head	1
to	1
foot	1
and	1
crowned	1
with	1
snow-white	1
hair,	1
on	1
which	1
the	1
moonshine	1
lay	1
like	1
a	1
benediction.	1
The	1
figure	1
stood	1
so	1
still	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
easily	1
have	1
supposed	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
statue.	1
Indeed,	1
he	1
thought	1
it	1
was	1
until	1
it	1
spoke.	1
"Evan,"	1
said	1
the	1
voice,	1
and	1
it	1
spoke	1
with	1
the	1
simple	1
authority	1
of	1
some	1
forgotten	1
father	1
revisiting	1
his	1
children,	1
"you	1
have	1
remained	1
here	1
long	1
enough,	1
and	1
your	1
sword	1
is	1
wanted	1
elsewhere."	1
"Wanted	1
for	1
what?"	1
asked	1
the	1
young	1
man,	1
accepting	1
the	1
monstrous	1
event	1
with	1
a	1
queer	1
and	1
clumsy	1
naturalness;	1
"what	1
is	1
my	1
sword	1
wanted	1
for?"	1
"For	1
all	1
that	1
you	1
hold	1
dear,"	1
said	1
the	1
man	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
moonlight;	1
"for	1
the	1
thrones	1
of	1
authority	1
and	1
for	1
all	1
ancient	1
loyalty	1
to	1
law."	1
Evan	1
looked	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
lunar	1
orb	1
again	1
as	1
if	1
in	1
irrational	1
appeal--a	1
moon	1
calf	1
bleating	1
to	1
his	1
mother	1
the	1
moon.	1
But	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
Luna	1
seemed	1
as	1
witless	1
as	1
his	1
own;	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
help	1
in	1
nature	1
against	1
the	1
supernatural;	1
and	1
he	1
looked	1
again	1
at	1
the	1
tall	1
marble	1
figure	1
that	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
made	1
out	1
of	1
solid	1
moonlight.	1
Then	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
loud	1
voice:	1
"Who	1
are	1
you?"	1
and	1
the	1
next	1
moment	1
was	1
seized	1
by	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
choking	1
terror	1
lest	1
his	1
question	1
should	1
be	1
answered.	1
But	1
the	1
unknown	1
preserved	1
an	1
impenetrable	1
silence	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
space	1
and	1
then	1
only	1
answered:	1
"I	1
must	1
not	1
say	1
who	1
I	1
am	1
until	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
world;	1
but	1
I	1
may	1
say	1
what	1
I	1
am.	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
law."	1
And	1
he	1
lifted	1
his	1
head	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
moon	1
smote	1
full	1
upon	1
his	1
beautiful	1
and	1
ancient	1
face.	1
The	1
face	1
was	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
a	1
Greek	1
god	1
grown	1
old,	1
but	1
not	1
grown	1
either	1
weak	1
or	1
ugly;	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
to	1
break	1
its	1
regularity	1
except	1
a	1
rather	1
long	1
chin	1
with	1
a	1
cleft	1
in	1
it,	1
and	1
this	1
rather	1
added	1
distinction	1
than	1
lessened	1
beauty.	1
His	1
strong,	1
well-opened	1
eyes	1
were	1
very	1
brilliant	1
but	1
quite	1
colourless	1
like	1
steel.	1
MacIan	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
to	1
whom	1
a	1
reverence	1
and	1
self-submission	1
in	1
ritual	1
come	1
quite	1
easy,	1
and	1
are	1
ordinary	1
things.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
artificial	1
in	1
him	1
to	1
bend	1
slightly	1
to	1
this	1
solemn	1
apparition	1
or	1
to	1
lower	1
his	1
voice	1
when	1
he	1
said:	1
"Do	1
you	1
bring	1
me	1
some	1
message?"	1
"I	1
do	1
bring	1
you	1
a	1
message,"	1
answered	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
moon	1
and	1
marble.	1
"The	1
king	1
has	1
returned."	1
Evan	1
did	1
not	1
ask	1
for	1
or	1
require	1
any	1
explanation.	1
"I	1
suppose	1
you	1
can	1
take	1
me	1
to	1
the	1
war,"	1
he	1
said,	1
and	1
the	1
silent	1
silver	1
figure	1
only	1
bowed	1
its	1
head	1
again.	1
MacIan	1
clambered	1
into	1
the	1
silver	1
boat,	1
and	1
it	1
rose	1
upward	1
to	1
the	1
stars.	1
To	1
say	1
that	1
it	1
rose	1
to	1
the	1
stars	1
is	1
no	1
mere	1
metaphor,	1
for	1
the	1
sky	1
had	1
cleared	1
to	1
that	1
occasional	1
and	1
astonishing	1
transparency	1
in	1
which	1
one	1
can	1
see	1
plainly	1
both	1
stars	1
and	1
moon.	1
As	1
the	1
white-robed	1
figure	1
went	1
upward	1
in	1
his	1
white	1
chariot,	1
he	1
said	1
quite	1
quietly	1
to	1
Evan:	1
"There	1
is	1
an	1
answer	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
folly	1
talked	1
about	1
equality.	1
Some	1
stars	1
are	1
big	1
and	1
some	1
small;	1
some	1
stand	1
still	1
and	1
some	1
circle	1
around	1
them	1
as	1
they	1
stand.	1
They	1
can	1
be	1
orderly,	1
but	1
they	1
cannot	1
be	1
equal."	1
"They	1
are	1
all	1
very	1
beautiful,"	1
said	1
Evan,	1
as	1
if	1
in	1
doubt.	1
"They	1
are	1
all	1
beautiful,"	1
answered	1
the	1
other,	1
"because	1
each	1
is	1
in	1
his	1
place	1
and	1
owns	1
his	1
superior.	1
And	1
now	1
England	1
will	1
be	1
beautiful	1
after	1
the	1
same	1
fashion.	1
The	1
earth	1
will	1
be	1
as	1
beautiful	1
as	1
the	1
heavens,	1
because	1
our	1
kings	1
have	1
come	1
back	1
to	1
us."	1
"The	1
Stuart----"	1
began	1
Evan,	1
earnestly.	1
"Yes,"	1
answered	1
the	1
old	1
man,	1
"that	1
which	1
has	1
returned	1
is	1
Stuart	1
and	1
yet	1
older	1
than	1
Stuart.	1
It	1
is	1
Capet	1
and	1
Plantagenet	1
and	1
Pendragon.	1
It	1
is	1
all	1
that	1
good	1
old	1
time	1
of	1
which	1
proverbs	1
tell,	1
that	1
golden	1
reign	1
of	1
Saturn	1
against	1
which	1
gods	1
and	1
men	1
were	1
rebels.	1
It	1
is	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
ever	1
lost	1
by	1
insolence	1
and	1
overwhelmed	1
in	1
rebellion.	1
It	1
is	1
your	1
own	1
forefather,	1
MacIan	1
with	1
the	1
broken	1
sword,	1
bleeding	1
without	1
hope	1
at	1
Culloden.	1
It	1
is	1
Charles	1
refusing	1
to	1
answer	1
the	1
questions	1
of	1
the	1
rebel	1
court.	1
It	1
is	1
Mary	1
of	1
the	1
magic	1
face	1
confronting	1
the	1
gloomy	1
and	1
grasping	1
peers	1
and	1
the	1
boorish	1
moralities	1
of	1
Knox.	1
It	1
is	1
Richard,	1
the	1
last	1
Plantagenet,	1
giving	1
his	1
crown	1
to	1
Bolingbroke	1
as	1
to	1
a	1
common	1
brigand.	1
It	1
is	1
Arthur,	1
overwhelmed	1
in	1
Lyonesse	1
by	1
heathen	1
armies	1
and	1
dying	1
in	1
the	1
mist,	1
doubtful	1
if	1
ever	1
he	1
shall	1
return."	1
"But	1
now----"	1
said	1
Evan,	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice.	1
"But	1
now!"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
man;	1
"he	1
has	1
returned."	1
"Is	1
the	1
war	1
still	1
raging?"	1
asked	1
MacIan.	1
"It	1
rages	1
like	1
the	1
pit	1
itself	1
beyond	1
the	1
sea	1
whither	1
I	1
am	1
taking	1
you,"	1
answered	1
the	1
other.	1
"But	1
in	1
England	1
the	1
king	1
enjoys	1
his	1
own	1
again.	1
The	1
people	1
are	1
once	1
more	1
taught	1
and	1
ruled	1
as	1
is	1
best;	1
they	1
are	1
happy	1
knights,	1
happy	1
squires,	1
happy	1
servants,	1
happy	1
serfs,	1
if	1
you	1
will;	1
but	1
free	1
at	1
last	1
of	1
that	1
load	1
of	1
vexation	1
and	1
lonely	1
vanity	1
which	1
was	1
called	1
being	1
a	1
citizen."	1
"Is	1
England,	1
indeed,	1
so	1
secure?"	1
asked	1
Evan.	1
"Look	1
out	1
and	1
see,"	1
said	1
the	1
guide.	1
"I	1
fancy	1
you	1
have	1
seen	1
this	1
place	1
before."	1
They	1
were	1
driving	1
through	1
the	1
air	1
towards	1
one	1
region	1
of	1
the	1
sky	1
where	1
the	1
hollow	1
of	1
night	1
seemed	1
darkest	1
and	1
which	1
was	1
quite	1
without	1
stars.	1
But	1
against	1
this	1
black	1
background	1
there	1
sprang	1
up,	1
picked	1
out	1
in	1
glittering	1
silver,	1
a	1
dome	1
and	1
a	1
cross.	1
It	1
seemed	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
really	1
newly	1
covered	1
with	1
silver,	1
which	1
in	1
the	1
strong	1
moonlight	1
was	1
like	1
white	1
flame.	1
But,	1
however,	1
covered	1
or	1
painted,	1
Evan	1
had	1
no	1
difficult	1
in	1
knowing	1
the	1
place	1
again.	1
He	1
saw	1
the	1
great	1
thoroughfare	1
that	1
sloped	1
upward	1
to	1
the	1
base	1
of	1
its	1
huge	1
pedestal	1
of	1
steps.	1
And	1
he	1
wondered	1
whether	1
the	1
little	1
shop	1
was	1
still	1
by	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
it	1
and	1
whether	1
its	1
window	1
had	1
been	1
mended.	1
As	1
the	1
flying	1
ship	1
swept	1
round	1
the	1
dome	1
he	1
observed	1
other	1
alterations.	1
The	1
dome	1
had	1
been	1
redecorated	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
give	1
it	1
a	1
more	1
solemn	1
and	1
somewhat	1
more	1
ecclesiastical	1
note;	1
the	1
ball	1
was	1
draped	1
or	1
destroyed,	1
and	1
round	1
the	1
gallery,	1
under	1
the	1
cross,	1
ran	1
what	1
looked	1
like	1
a	1
ring	1
of	1
silver	1
statues,	1
like	1
the	1
little	1
leaden	1
images	1
that	1
stood	1
round	1
the	1
hat	1
of	1
Louis	1
XI.	1
Round	1
the	1
second	1
gallery,	1
at	1
the	1
base	1
of	1
the	1
dome,	1
ran	1
a	1
second	1
rank	1
of	1
such	1
images,	1
and	1
Evan	1
thought	1
there	1
was	1
another	1
round	1
the	1
steps	1
below.	1
When	1
they	1
came	1
closer	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
figures	1
in	1
complete	1
armour	1
of	1
steel	1
or	1
silver,	1
each	1
with	1
a	1
naked	1
sword,	1
point	1
upward;	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
saw	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
swords	1
move.	1
These	1
were	1
not	1
statues	1
but	1
an	1
armed	1
order	1
of	1
chivalry	1
thrown	1
in	1
three	1
circles	1
round	1
the	1
cross.	1
MacIan	1
drew	1
in	1
his	1
breath,	1
as	1
children	1
do	1
at	1
anything	1
they	1
think	1
utterly	1
beautiful.	1
For	1
he	1
could	1
imagine	1
nothing	1
that	1
so	1
echoed	1
his	1
own	1
visions	1
of	1
pontifical	1
or	1
chivalric	1
art	1
as	1
this	1
white	1
dome	1
sitting	1
like	1
a	1
vast	1
silver	1
tiara	1
over	1
London,	1
ringed	1
with	1
a	1
triple	1
crown	1
of	1
swords.	1
As	1
they	1
went	1
sailing	1
down	1
Ludgate	1
Hill,	1
Evan	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
the	1
streets	1
fully	1
answered	1
his	1
companion's	1
claim	1
about	1
the	1
reintroduction	1
of	1
order.	1
All	1
the	1
old	1
blackcoated	1
bustle	1
with	1
its	1
cockney	1
vivacity	1
and	1
vulgarity	1
had	1
disappeared.	1
Groups	1
of	1
labourers,	1
quietly	1
but	1
picturesquely	1
clad,	1
were	1
passing	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
in	1
sufficiently	1
large	1
numbers;	1
but	1
it	1
required	1
but	1
a	1
few	1
mounted	1
men	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
streets	1
in	1
order.	1
The	1
mounted	1
men	1
were	1
not	1
common	1
policemen,	1
but	1
knights	1
with	1
spurs	1
and	1
plume	1
whose	1
smooth	1
and	1
splendid	1
armour	1
glittered	1
like	1
diamond	1
rather	1
than	1
steel.	1
Only	1
in	1
one	1
place--at	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
Bouverie	1
Street--did	1
there	1
appear	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
moment's	1
confusion,	1
and	1
that	1
was	1
due	1
to	1
hurry	1
rather	1
than	1
resistance.	1
But	1
one	1
old	1
grumbling	1
man	1
did	1
not	1
get	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way	1
quick	1
enough,	1
and	1
the	1
man	1
on	1
horseback	1
struck	1
him,	1
not	1
severely,	1
across	1
the	1
shoulders	1
with	1
the	1
flat	1
of	1
his	1
sword.	1
"The	1
soldier	1
had	1
no	1
business	1
to	1
do	1
that,"	1
said	1
MacIan,	1
sharply.	1
"The	1
old	1
man	1
was	1
moving	1
as	1
quickly	1
as	1
he	1
could."	1
"We	1
attach	1
great	1
importance	1
to	1
discipline	1
in	1
the	1
streets,"	1
said	1
the	1
man	1
in	1
white,	1
with	1
a	1
slight	1
smile.	1
"Discipline	1
is	1
not	1
so	1
important	1
as	1
justice,"	1
said	1
MacIan.	1
The	1
other	1
did	1
not	1
answer.	1
Then	1
after	1
a	1
swift	1
silence	1
that	1
took	1
them	1
out	1
across	1
St.	1
James's	1
Park,	1
he	1
said:	1
"The	1
people	1
must	1
be	1
taught	1
to	1
obey;	1
they	1
must	1
learn	1
their	1
own	1
ignorance.	1
And	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
sure,"	1
he	1
continued,	1
turning	1
his	1
back	1
on	1
Evan	1
and	1
looking	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
prow	1
of	1
the	1
ship	1
into	1
the	1
darkness,	1
"I	1
am	1
not	1
sure	1
that	1
I	1
agree	1
with	1
your	1
little	1
maxim	1
about	1
justice.	1
Discipline	1
for	1
the	1
whole	1
society	1
is	1
surely	1
more	1
important	1
than	1
justice	1
to	1
an	1
individual."	1
Evan,	1
who	1
was	1
also	1
leaning	1
over	1
the	1
edge,	1
swung	1
round	1
with	1
startling	1
suddenness	1
and	1
stared	1
at	1
the	1
other's	1
back.	1
"Discipline	1
for	1
society----"	1
he	1
repeated,	1
very	1
staccato,	1
"more	1
important--justice	1
to	1
individual?"	1
Then	1
after	1
a	1
long	1
silence	1
he	1
called	1
out:	1
"Who	1
and	1
what	1
are	1
you?"	1
"I	1
am	1
an	1
angel,"	1
said	1
the	1
white-robed	1
figure,	1
without	1
turning	1
round.	1
"You	1
are	1
not	1
a	1
Catholic,"	1
said	1
MacIan.	1
The	1
other	1
seemed	1
to	1
take	1
no	1
notice,	1
but	1
reverted	1
to	1
the	1
main	1
topic.	1
"In	1
our	1
armies	1
up	1
in	1
heaven	1
we	1
learn	1
to	1
put	1
a	1
wholesome	1
fear	1
into	1
subordinates."	1
MacIan	1
sat	1
craning	1
his	1
neck	1
forward	1
with	1
an	1
extraordinary	1
and	1
unaccountable	1
eagerness.	1
"Go	1
on!"	1
he	1
cried,	1
twisting	1
and	1
untwisting	1
his	1
long,	1
bony	1
fingers,	1
"go	1
on!"	1
"Besides,"	1
continued	1
he,	1
in	1
the	1
prow,	1
"you	1
must	1
allow	1
for	1
a	1
certain	1
high	1
spirit	1
and	1
haughtiness	1
in	1
the	1
superior	1
type."	1
"Go	1
on!"	1
said	1
Evan,	1
with	1
burning	1
eyes.	1
"Just	1
as	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
sin	1
offends	1
God,"	1
said	1
the	1
unknown,	1
"so	1
does	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
ugliness	1
offend	1
Apollo.	1
The	1
beautiful	1
and	1
princely	1
must,	1
of	1
necessity,	1
be	1
impatient	1
with	1
the	1
squalid	1
and----"	1
"Why,	1
you	1
great	1
fool!"	1
cried	1
MacIan,	1
rising	1
to	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
his	1
tremendous	1
stature,	1
"did	1
you	1
think	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
doubted	1
only	1
for	1
that	1
rap	1
with	1
a	1
sword?	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
noble	1
orders	1
have	1
bad	1
knights,	1
that	1
good	1
knights	1
have	1
bad	1
tempers,	1
that	1
the	1
Church	1
has	1
rough	1
priests	1
and	1
coarse	1
cardinals;	1
I	1
have	1
known	1
it	1
ever	1
since	1
I	1
was	1
born.	1
You	1
fool!	1
you	1
had	1
only	1
to	1
say,	1
'Yes,	1
it	1
is	1
rather	1
a	1
shame,'	1
and	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
forgotten	1
the	1
affair.	1
But	1
I	1
saw	1
on	1
your	1
mouth	1
the	1
twitch	1
of	1
your	1
infernal	1
sophistry;	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
something	1
was	1
wrong	1
with	1
you	1
and	1
your	1
cathedrals.	1
Something	1
is	1
wrong;	1
everything	1
is	1
wrong.	1
You	1
are	1
not	1
an	1
angel.	1
That	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
church.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
rightful	1
king	1
who	1
has	1
come	1
home."	1
"That	1
is	1
unfortunate,"	1
said	1
the	1
other,	1
in	1
a	1
quiet	1
but	1
hard	1
voice,	1
"because	1
you	1
are	1
going	1
to	1
see	1
his	1
Majesty."	1
"No,"	1
said	1
MacIan,	1
"I	1
am	1
going	1
to	1
jump	1
over	1
the	1
side."	1
"Do	1
you	1
desire	1
death?"	1
"No,"	1
said	1
Evan,	1
quite	1
composedly,	1
"I	1
desire	1
a	1
miracle."	1
"From	1
whom	1
do	1
you	1
ask	1
it?	1
To	1
whom	1
do	1
you	1
appeal?"	1
said	1
his	1
companion,	1
sternly.	1
"You	1
have	1
betrayed	1
the	1
king,	1
renounced	1
his	1
cross	1
on	1
the	1
cathedral,	1
and	1
insulted	1
an	1
archangel."	1
"I	1
appeal	1
to	1
God,"	1
said	1
Evan,	1
and	1
sprang	1
up	1
and	1
stood	1
upon	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
swaying	1
ship.	1
The	1
being	1
in	1
the	1
prow	1
turned	1
slowly	1
round;	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
Evan	1
with	1
eyes	1
which	1
were	1
like	1
two	1
suns,	1
and	1
put	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
his	1
mouth	1
just	1
too	1
late	1
to	1
hide	1
an	1
awful	1
smile.	1
"And	1
how	1
do	1
you	1
know,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"how	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
God?"	1
MacIan	1
screamed.	1
"Ah!"	1
he	1
cried.	1
"Now	1
I	1
know	1
who	1
you	1
really	1
are.	1
You	1
are	1
not	1
God.	1
You	1
are	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
God's	1
angels.	1
But	1
you	1
were	1
once."	1
The	1
being's	1
hand	1
dropped	1
from	1
his	1
mouth	1
and	1
Evan	1
dropped	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
car.	1
XVI.	1
THE	1
DREAM	1
OF	1
TURNBULL	1
Turnbull	1
was	1
walking	1
rather	1
rampantly	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
garden	1
on	1
a	1
gusty	1
evening	1
chewing	1
his	1
cigar	1
and	1
in	1
that	1
mood	1
when	1
every	1
man	1
suppresses	1
an	1
instinct	1
to	1
spit.	1
He	1
was	1
not,	1
as	1
a	1
rule,	1
a	1
man	1
much	1
acquainted	1
with	1
moods;	1
and	1
the	1
storms	1
and	1
sunbursts	1
of	1
MacIan's	1
soul	1
passed	1
before	1
him	1
as	1
an	1
impressive	1
but	1
unmeaning	1
panorama,	1
like	1
the	1
anarchy	1
of	1
Highland	1
scenery.	1
Turnbull	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
men	1
in	1
whom	1
a	1
continuous	1
appetite	1
and	1
industry	1
of	1
the	1
intellect	1
leave	1
the	1
emotions	1
very	1
simple	1
and	1
steady.	1
His	1
heart	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
right	1
place;	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
quite	1
content	1
to	1
leave	1
it	1
there.	1
It	1
was	1
his	1
head	1
that	1
was	1
his	1
hobby.	1
His	1
mornings	1
and	1
evenings	1
were	1
marked	1
not	1
by	1
impulses	1
or	1
thirsty	1
desires,	1
not	1
by	1
hope	1
or	1
by	1
heart-break;	1
they	1
were	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
fallacies	1
he	1
had	1
detected,	1
the	1
problems	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
plain,	1
the	1
adverse	1
theories	1
he	1
had	1
wrestled	1
with	1
and	1
thrown,	1
the	1
grand	1
generalizations	1
he	1
had	1
justified.	1
But	1
even	1
the	1
cheerful	1
inner	1
life	1
of	1
a	1
logician	1
may	1
be	1
upset	1
by	1
a	1
lunatic	1
asylum,	1
to	1
say	1
nothing	1
of	1
whiffs	1
of	1
memory	1
from	1
a	1
lady	1
in	1
Jersey,	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
red-bearded	1
man	1
on	1
this	1
windy	1
evening	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
dangerous	1
frame	1
of	1
mind.	1
Plain	1
and	1
positive	1
as	1
he	1
was,	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
earth	1
and	1
sky	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
greater	1
on	1
him	1
than	1
he	1
imagined;	1
and	1
the	1
weather	1
that	1
walked	1
the	1
world	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
was	1
as	1
red	1
and	1
angry	1
as	1
Turnbull.	1
Long	1
strips	1
and	1
swirls	1
of	1
tattered	1
and	1
tawny	1
cloud	1
were	1
dragged	1
downward	1
to	1
the	1
west	1
exactly	1
as	1
torn	1
red	1
raiment	1
would	1
be	1
dragged.	1
And	1
so	1
strong	1
and	1
pitiless	1
was	1
the	1
wind	1
that	1
it	1
whipped	1
away	1
fragments	1
of	1
red-flowering	1
bushes	1
or	1
of	1
copper	1
beech,	1
and	1
drove	1
them	1
also	1
across	1
the	1
garden,	1
a	1
drift	1
of	1
red	1
leaves,	1
like	1
the	1
leaves	1
of	1
autumn,	1
as	1
in	1
parody	1
of	1
the	1
red	1
and	1
driven	1
rags	1
of	1
cloud.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
sense	1
in	1
earth	1
and	1
heaven	1
as	1
of	1
everything	1
breaking	1
up,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
revolutionist	1
in	1
Turnbull	1
rejoiced	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
breaking	1
up.	1
The	1
trees	1
were	1
breaking	1
up	1
under	1
the	1
wind,	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
tall	1
strength	1
of	1
their	1
bloom:	1
the	1
clouds	1
were	1
breaking	1
up	1
and	1
losing	1
even	1
their	1
large	1
heraldic	1
shapes.	1
Shards	1
and	1
shreds	1
of	1
copper	1
cloud	1
split	1
off	1
continually	1
and	1
floated	1
by	1
themselves,	1
and	1
for	1
some	1
reason	1
the	1
truculent	1
eye	1
of	1
Turnbull	1
was	1
attracted	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
careering	1
cloudlets,	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
career	1
in	1
an	1
exaggerated	1
manner.	1
Also	1
it	1
kept	1
its	1
shape,	1
which	1
is	1
unusual	1
with	1
clouds	1
shaken	1
off;	1
also	1
its	1
shape	1
was	1
of	1
an	1
odd	1
sort.	1
Turnbull	1
continued	1
to	1
stare	1
at	1
it,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
little	1
time	1
occurred	1
that	1
crucial	1
instant	1
when	1
a	1
thing,	1
however	1
incredible,	1
is	1
accepted	1
as	1
a	1
fact.	1
The	1
copper	1
cloud	1
was	1
tumbling	1
down	1
towards	1
the	1
earth,	1
like	1
some	1
gigantic	1
leaf	1
from	1
the	1
copper	1
beeches.	1
And	1
as	1
it	1
came	1
nearer	1
it	1
was	1
evident,	1
first,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
cloud,	1
and,	1
second,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
itself	1
of	1
the	1
colour	1
of	1
copper;	1
only,	1
being	1
burnished	1
like	1
a	1
mirror,	1
it	1
had	1
reflected	1
the	1
red-brown	1
colours	1
of	1
the	1
burning	1
clouds.	1
As	1
the	1
thing	1
whirled	1
like	1
a	1
windswept	1
leaf	1
down	1
towards	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
the	1
garden	1
it	1
was	1
clear	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
some	1
sort	1
of	1
air-ship	1
made	1
of	1
metal,	1
and	1
slapping	1
the	1
air	1
with	1
big	1
broad	1
fins	1
of	1
steel.	1
When	1
it	1
came	1
about	1
a	1
hundred	1
feet	1
above	1
the	1
garden,	1
a	1
shaggy,	1
lean	1
figure	1
leapt	1
up	1
in	1
it,	1
almost	1
black	1
against	1
the	1
bronze	1
and	1
scarlet	1
of	1
the	1
west,	1
and,	1
flinging	1
out	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
hook	1
or	1
anchor,	1
caught	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
green	1
apple-tree	1
just	1
under	1
the	1
wall;	1
and	1
from	1
that	1
fixed	1
holding	1
ground	1
the	1
ship	1
swung	1
in	1
the	1
red	1
tempest	1
like	1
a	1
captive	1
balloon.	1
While	1
our	1
friend	1
stood	1
frozen	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
by	1
his	1
astonishment,	1
the	1
queer	1
figure	1
in	1
the	1
airy	1
car	1
tipped	1
the	1
vehicle	1
almost	1
upside	1
down	1
by	1
leaping	1
over	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
it,	1
seemed	1
to	1
slide	1
or	1
drop	1
down	1
the	1
rope	1
like	1
a	1
monkey,	1
and	1
alighted	1
(with	1
impossible	1
precision	1
and	1
placidity)	1
seated	1
on	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
wall,	1
over	1
which	1
he	1
kicked	1
and	1
dangled	1
his	1
legs	1
as	1
he	1
grinned	1
at	1
Turnbull.	1
The	1
wind	1
roared	1
in	1
the	1
trees	1
yet	1
more	1
ruinous	1
and	1
desolate,	1
the	1
red	1
tails	1
of	1
the	1
sunset	1
were	1
dragged	1
downward	1
like	1
red	1
dragons	1
sucked	1
down	1
to	1
death,	1
and	1
still	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
asylum	1
wall	1
sat	1
the	1
sinister	1
figure	1
with	1
the	1
grimace,	1
swinging	1
his	1
feet	1
in	1
tune	1
with	1
the	1
tempest;	1
while	1
above	1
him,	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
its	1
tossing	1
or	1
tightened	1
cord,	1
the	1
enormous	1
iron	1
air-ship	1
floated	1
as	1
light	1
and	1
as	1
little	1
noticed	1
as	1
a	1
baby's	1
balloon	1
upon	1
its	1
string.	1
Turnbull's	1
first	1
movement	1
after	1
sixty	1
motionless	1
seconds	1
was	1
to	1
turn	1
round	1
and	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
large,	1
luxuriant	1
parallelogram	1
of	1
the	1
garden	1
and	1
the	1
long,	1
low	1
rectangular	1
building	1
beyond.	1
There	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
soul	1
or	1
a	1
stir	1
of	1
life	1
within	1
sight.	1
And	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
quite	1
meaningless	1
sensation,	1
as	1
if	1
there	1
never	1
really	1
had	1
been	1
any	1
one	1
else	1
there	1
except	1
he	1
since	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
Stiffening	1
in	1
himself	1
the	1
masculine	1
but	1
mirthless	1
courage	1
of	1
the	1
atheist,	1
he	1
drew	1
a	1
little	1
nearer	1
to	1
the	1
wall	1
and,	1
catching	1
the	1
man	1
at	1
a	1
slightly	1
different	1
angle	1
of	1
the	1
evening	1
light,	1
could	1
see	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
figure	1
quite	1
plain.	1
Two	1
facts	1
about	1
him	1
stood	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
picked	1
colours	1
of	1
some	1
piratical	1
schoolboy's	1
story.	1
The	1
first	1
was	1
that	1
his	1
lean	1
brown	1
body	1
was	1
bare	1
to	1
the	1
belt	1
of	1
his	1
loose	1
white	1
trousers;	1
the	1
other	1
that	1
through	1
hygiene,	1
affectation,	1
or	1
whatever	1
other	1
cause,	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
scarlet	1
handkerchief	1
tied	1
tightly	1
but	1
somewhat	1
aslant	1
across	1
his	1
brow.	1
After	1
these	1
two	1
facts	1
had	1
become	1
emphatic,	1
others	1
appeared	1
sufficiently	1
important.	1
One	1
was	1
that	1
under	1
the	1
scarlet	1
rag	1
the	1
hair	1
was	1
plentiful,	1
but	1
white	1
as	1
with	1
the	1
last	1
snows	1
of	1
mortality.	1
Another	1
was	1
that	1
under	1
the	1
mop	1
of	1
white	1
and	1
senile	1
hair	1
the	1
face	1
was	1
strong,	1
handsome,	1
and	1
smiling,	1
with	1
a	1
well-cut	1
profile	1
and	1
a	1
long	1
cloven	1
chin.	1
The	1
length	1
of	1
this	1
lower	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
face	1
and	1
the	1
strange	1
cleft	1
in	1
it	1
(which	1
gave	1
the	1
man,	1
in	1
quite	1
another	1
sense	1
from	1
the	1
common	1
one,	1
a	1
double	1
chin)	1
faintly	1
spoilt	1
the	1
claim	1
of	1
the	1
face	1
to	1
absolute	1
regularity,	1
but	1
it	1
greatly	1
assisted	1
it	1
in	1
wearing	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
half-smiling	1
and	1
half-sneering	1
arrogance	1
with	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
staring	1
at	1
all	1
the	1
stones,	1
all	1
the	1
flowers,	1
but	1
especially	1
at	1
the	1
solitary	1
man.	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
want?"	1
shouted	1
Turnbull.	1
"I	1
want	1
you,	1
Jimmy,"	1
said	1
the	1
eccentric	1
man	1
on	1
the	1
wall,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
very	1
word	1
he	1
had	1
let	1
himself	1
down	1
with	1
a	1
leap	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
centre	1
of	1
the	1
lawn,	1
where	1
he	1
bounded	1
once	1
literally	1
like	1
an	1
India-rubber	1
ball	1
and	1
then	1
stood	1
grinning	1
with	1
his	1
legs	1
astride.	1
The	1
only	1
three	1
facts	1
that	1
Turnbull	1
could	1
now	1
add	1
to	1
his	1
inventory	1
were	1
that	1
the	1
man	1
had	1
an	1
ugly-looking	1
knife	1
swinging	1
at	1
his	1
trousers	1
belt,	1
that	1
his	1
brown	1
feet	1
were	1
as	1
bare	1
as	1
his	1
bronzed	1
trunk	1
and	1
arms,	1
and	1
that	1
his	1
eyes	1
had	1
a	1
singular	1
bleak	1
brilliancy	1
which	1
was	1
of	1
no	1
particular	1
colour.	1
"Excuse	1
my	1
not	1
being	1
in	1
evening	1
dress,"	1
said	1
the	1
newcomer	1
with	1
an	1
urbane	1
smile.	1
"We	1
scientific	1
men,	1
you	1
know--I	1
have	1
to	1
work	1
my	1
own	1
engines--electrical	1
engineer--very	1
hot	1
work."	1
"Look	1
here,"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
sturdily	1
clenching	1
his	1
fists	1
in	1
his	1
trousers	1
pockets,	1
"I	1
am	1
bound	1
to	1
expect	1
lunatics	1
inside	1
these	1
four	1
walls;	1
but	1
I	1
do	1
bar	1
their	1
coming	1
from	1
outside,	1
bang	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
sunset	1
clouds."	1
"And	1
yet	1
you	1
came	1
from	1
the	1
outside,	1
too,	1
Jim,"	1
said	1
the	1
stranger	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
almost	1
affectionate.	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
want?"	1
asked	1
Turnbull,	1
with	1
an	1
explosion	1
of	1
temper	1
as	1
sudden	1
as	1
a	1
pistol	1
shot.	1
"I	1
have	1
already	1
told	1
you,"	1
said	1
the	1
man,	1
lowering	1
his	1
voice	1
and	1
speaking	1
with	1
evident	1
sincerity;	1
"I	1
want	1
you."	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
want	1
with	1
me?"	1
"I	1
want	1
exactly	1
what	1
you	1
want,"	1
said	1
the	1
new-comer	1
with	1
a	1
new	1
gravity.	1
"I	1
want	1
the	1
Revolution."	1
Turnbull	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
fire-swept	1
sky	1
and	1
the	1
wind-stricken	1
woodlands,	1
and	1
kept	1
on	1
repeating	1
the	1
word	1
voicelessly	1
to	1
himself--the	1
word	1
that	1
did	1
indeed	1
so	1
thoroughly	1
express	1
his	1
mood	1
of	1
rage	1
as	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
among	1
those	1
red	1
clouds	1
and	1
rocking	1
tree-tops.	1
"Revolution!"	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself.	1
"The	1
Revolution--yes,	1
that	1
is	1
what	1
I	1
want	1
right	1
enough--anything,	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
Revolution."	1
To	1
some	1
cause	1
he	1
could	1
never	1
explain	1
he	1
found	1
himself	1
completing	1
the	1
sentence	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
wall,	1
having	1
automatically	1
followed	1
the	1
stranger	1
so	1
far.	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
stranger	1
silently	1
indicated	1
the	1
rope	1
that	1
led	1
to	1
the	1
machine,	1
he	1
found	1
himself	1
pausing	1
and	1
saying:	1
"I	1
can't	1
leave	1
MacIan	1
behind	1
in	1
this	1
den."	1
"We	1
are	1
going	1
to	1
destroy	1
the	1
Pope	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
kings,"	1
said	1
the	1
new-comer.	1
"Would	1
it	1
be	1
wiser	1
to	1
take	1
him	1
with	1
us?"	1
Somehow	1
the	1
muttering	1
Turnbull	1
found	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
flying	1
ship	1
also,	1
and	1
it	1
swung	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
sunset.	1
"All	1
the	1
great	1
rebels	1
have	1
been	1
very	1
little	1
rebels,"	1
said	1
the	1
man	1
with	1
the	1
red	1
scarf.	1
"They	1
have	1
been	1
like	1
fourth-form	1
boys	1
who	1
sometimes	1
venture	1
to	1
hit	1
a	1
fifth-form	1
boy.	1
That	1
was	1
all	1
the	1
worth	1
of	1
their	1
French	1
Revolution	1
and	1
regicide.	1
The	1
boys	1
never	1
really	1
dared	1
to	1
defy	1
the	1
schoolmaster."	1
"Whom	1
do	1
you	1
mean	1
by	1
the	1
schoolmaster?"	1
asked	1
Turnbull.	1
"You	1
know	1
whom	1
I	1
mean,"	1
answered	1
the	1
strange	1
man,	1
as	1
he	1
lay	1
back	1
on	1
cushions	1
and	1
looked	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
angry	1
sky.	1
They	1
seemed	1
rising	1
into	1
stronger	1
and	1
stronger	1
sunlight,	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
sunrise	1
rather	1
than	1
sunset.	1
But	1
when	1
they	1
looked	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
earth	1
they	1
saw	1
it	1
growing	1
darker	1
and	1
darker.	1
The	1
lunatic	1
asylum	1
in	1
its	1
large	1
rectangular	1
grounds	1
spread	1
below	1
them	1
in	1
a	1
foreshortened	1
and	1
infantile	1
plan,	1
and	1
looked	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
the	1
grotesque	1
thing	1
that	1
it	1
was.	1
But	1
the	1
clear	1
colours	1
of	1
the	1
plan	1
were	1
growing	1
darker	1
every	1
moment.	1
The	1
masses	1
of	1
rose	1
or	1
rhododendron	1
deepened	1
from	1
crimson	1
to	1
violet.	1
The	1
maze	1
of	1
gravel	1
pathways	1
faded	1
from	1
gold	1
to	1
brown.	1
By	1
the	1
time	1
they	1
had	1
risen	1
a	1
few	1
hundred	1
feet	1
higher	1
nothing	1
could	1
be	1
seen	1
of	1
that	1
darkening	1
landscape	1
except	1
the	1
lines	1
of	1
lighted	1
windows,	1
each	1
one	1
of	1
which,	1
at	1
least,	1
was	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
one	1
lost	1
intelligence.	1
But	1
on	1
them	1
as	1
they	1
swept	1
upward	1
better	1
and	1
braver	1
winds	1
seemed	1
to	1
blow,	1
and	1
on	1
them	1
the	1
ruby	1
light	1
of	1
evening	1
seemed	1
struck,	1
and	1
splashed	1
like	1
red	1
spurts	1
from	1
the	1
grapes	1
of	1
Dionysus.	1
Below	1
them	1
the	1
fallen	1
lights	1
were	1
literally	1
the	1
fallen	1
stars	1
of	1
servitude.	1
And	1
above	1
them	1
all	1
the	1
red	1
and	1
raging	1
clouds	1
were	1
like	1
the	1
leaping	1
flags	1
of	1
liberty.	1
The	1
man	1
with	1
the	1
cloven	1
chin	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
singular	1
power	1
of	1
understanding	1
thoughts;	1
for,	1
as	1
Turnbull	1
felt	1
the	1
whole	1
universe	1
tilt	1
and	1
turn	1
over	1
his	1
head,	1
the	1
stranger	1
said	1
exactly	1
the	1
right	1
thing.	1
"Doesn't	1
it	1
seem	1
as	1
if	1
everything	1
were	1
being	1
upset?"	1
said	1
he;	1
"and	1
if	1
once	1
everything	1
is	1
upset,	1
He	1
will	1
be	1
upset	1
on	1
top	1
of	1
it."	1
Then,	1
as	1
Turnbull	1
made	1
no	1
answer,	1
his	1
host	1
continued:	1
"That	1
is	1
the	1
really	1
fine	1
thing	1
about	1
space.	1
It	1
is	1
topsy-turvy.	1
You	1
have	1
only	1
to	1
climb	1
far	1
enough	1
towards	1
the	1
morning	1
star	1
to	1
feel	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
coming	1
down	1
to	1
it.	1
You	1
have	1
only	1
to	1
dive	1
deep	1
enough	1
into	1
the	1
abyss	1
to	1
feel	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
rising.	1
That	1
is	1
the	1
only	1
glory	1
of	1
this	1
universe--it	1
is	1
a	1
giddy	1
universe."	1
Then,	1
as	1
Turnbull	1
was	1
still	1
silent,	1
he	1
added:	1
"The	1
heavens	1
are	1
full	1
of	1
revolution--of	1
the	1
real	1
sort	1
of	1
revolution.	1
All	1
the	1
high	1
things	1
are	1
sinking	1
low	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
big	1
things	1
looking	1
small.	1
All	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
think	1
they	1
are	1
aspiring	1
find	1
they	1
are	1
falling	1
head	1
foremost.	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
think	1
they	1
are	1
condescending	1
find	1
they	1
are	1
climbing	1
up	1
a	1
precipice.	1
That	1
is	1
the	1
intoxication	1
of	1
space.	1
That	1
is	1
the	1
only	1
joy	1
of	1
eternity--doubt.	1
There	1
is	1
only	1
one	1
pleasure	1
the	1
angels	1
can	1
possibly	1
have	1
in	1
flying,	1
and	1
that	1
is,	1
that	1
they	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
whether	1
they	1
are	1
on	1
their	1
head	1
or	1
their	1
heels."	1
Then,	1
finding	1
his	1
companion	1
still	1
mute,	1
he	1
fell	1
himself	1
into	1
a	1
smiling	1
and	1
motionless	1
meditation,	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
said	1
suddenly:	1
"So	1
MacIan	1
converted	1
you?"	1
Turnbull	1
sprang	1
up	1
as	1
if	1
spurning	1
the	1
steel	1
car	1
from	1
under	1
his	1
feet.	1
"Converted	1
me!"	1
he	1
cried.	1
"What	1
the	1
devil	1
do	1
you	1
mean?	1
I	1
have	1
known	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
month,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
retracted	1
a	1
single----"	1
"This	1
Catholicism	1
is	1
a	1
curious	1
thing,"	1
said	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
cloven	1
chin	1
in	1
uninterrupted	1
reflectiveness,	1
leaning	1
his	1
elegant	1
elbows	1
over	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
vessel;	1
"it	1
soaks	1
and	1
weakens	1
men	1
without	1
their	1
knowing	1
it,	1
just	1
as	1
I	1
fear	1
it	1
has	1
soaked	1
and	1
weakened	1
you."	1
Turnbull	1
stood	1
in	1
an	1
attitude	1
which	1
might	1
well	1
have	1
meant	1
pitching	1
the	1
other	1
man	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
flying	1
ship.	1
"I	1
am	1
an	1
atheist,"	1
he	1
said,	1
in	1
a	1
stifled	1
voice.	1
"I	1
have	1
always	1
been	1
an	1
atheist.	1
I	1
am	1
still	1
an	1
atheist."	1
Then,	1
addressing	1
the	1
other's	1
indolent	1
and	1
indifferent	1
back,	1
he	1
cried:	1
"In	1
God's	1
name	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
mean?"	1
And	1
the	1
other	1
answered	1
without	1
turning	1
round:	1
"I	1
mean	1
nothing	1
in	1
God's	1
name."	1
Turnbull	1
spat	1
over	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
car	1
and	1
fell	1
back	1
furiously	1
into	1
his	1
seat.	1
The	1
other	1
continued	1
still	1
unruffled,	1
and	1
staring	1
over	1
the	1
edge	1
idly	1
as	1
an	1
angler	1
stares	1
down	1
at	1
a	1
stream.	1
"The	1
truth	1
is	1
that	1
we	1
never	1
thought	1
that	1
you	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
caught,"	1
he	1
said;	1
"we	1
counted	1
on	1
you	1
as	1
the	1
one	1
red-hot	1
revolutionary	1
left	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
But,	1
of	1
course,	1
these	1
men	1
like	1
MacIan	1
are	1
awfully	1
clever,	1
especially	1
when	1
they	1
pretend	1
to	1
be	1
stupid."	1
Turnbull	1
leapt	1
up	1
again	1
in	1
a	1
living	1
fury	1
and	1
cried:	1
"What	1
have	1
I	1
got	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
MacIan?	1
I	1
believe	1
all	1
I	1
ever	1
believed,	1
and	1
disbelieve	1
all	1
I	1
ever	1
disbelieved.	1
What	1
does	1
all	1
this	1
mean,	1
and	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
want	1
with	1
me	1
here?"	1
Then	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
the	1
other	1
lifted	1
himself	1
from	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
car	1
and	1
faced	1
him.	1
"I	1
have	1
brought	1
you	1
here,"	1
he	1
answered,	1
"to	1
take	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
war	1
of	1
the	1
world."	1
"The	1
last	1
war!"	1
repeated	1
Turnbull,	1
even	1
in	1
his	1
dazed	1
state	1
a	1
little	1
touchy	1
about	1
such	1
a	1
dogma;	1
"how	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
last?"	1
The	1
man	1
laid	1
himself	1
back	1
in	1
his	1
reposeful	1
attitude,	1
and	1
said:	1
"It	1
is	1
the	1
last	1
war,	1
because	1
if	1
it	1
does	1
not	1
cure	1
the	1
world	1
for	1
ever,	1
it	1
will	1
destroy	1
it."	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
mean?"	1
"I	1
only	1
mean	1
what	1
you	1
mean,"	1
answered	1
the	1
unknown	1
in	1
a	1
temperate	1
voice.	1
"What	1
was	1
it	1
that	1
you	1
always	1
meant	1
on	1
those	1
million	1
and	1
one	1
nights	1
when	1
you	1
walked	1
outside	1
your	1
Ludgate	1
Hill	1
shop	1
and	1
shook	1
your	1
hand	1
in	1
the	1
air?"	1
"Still	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
see,"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
stubbornly.	1
"You	1
will	1
soon,"	1
said	1
the	1
other,	1
and	1
abruptly	1
bent	1
downward	1
one	1
iron	1
handle	1
of	1
his	1
huge	1
machine.	1
The	1
engine	1
stopped,	1
stooped,	1
and	1
dived	1
almost	1
as	1
deliberately	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
bathing;	1
in	1
their	1
downward	1
rush	1
they	1
swept	1
within	1
fifty	1
yards	1
of	1
a	1
big	1
bulk	1
of	1
stone	1
that	1
Turnbull	1
knew	1
only	1
too	1
well.	1
The	1
last	1
red	1
anger	1
of	1
the	1
sunset	1
was	1
ended;	1
the	1
dome	1
of	1
heaven	1
was	1
dark;	1
the	1
lanes	1
of	1
flaring	1
light	1
in	1
the	1
streets	1
below	1
hardly	1
lit	1
up	1
the	1
base	1
of	1
the	1
building.	1
But	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
St.	1
Paul's	1
Cathedral,	1
and	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
it	1
the	1
ball	1
was	1
still	1
standing	1
erect,	1
but	1
the	1
cross	1
was	1
stricken	1
and	1
had	1
fallen	1
sideways.	1
Then	1
only	1
he	1
cared	1
to	1
look	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
streets,	1
and	1
saw	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
inflamed	1
with	1
uproar	1
and	1
tossing	1
passions.	1
"We	1
arrive	1
at	1
a	1
happy	1
moment,"	1
said	1
the	1
man	1
steering	1
the	1
ship.	1
"The	1
insurgents	1
are	1
bombarding	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
a	1
cannon-ball	1
has	1
just	1
hit	1
the	1
cross.	1
Many	1
of	1
the	1
insurgents	1
are	1
simple	1
people,	1
and	1
they	1
naturally	1
regard	1
it	1
as	1
a	1
happy	1
omen."	1
"Quite	1
so,"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
in	1
a	1
rather	1
colourless	1
voice.	1
"Yes,"	1
replied	1
the	1
other.	1
"I	1
thought	1
you	1
would	1
be	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
your	1
prayer	1
answered.	1
Of	1
course	1
I	1
apologize	1
for	1
the	1
word	1
prayer."	1
"Don't	1
mention	1
it,"	1
said	1
Turnbull.	1
The	1
flying	1
ship	1
had	1
come	1
down	1
upon	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
curve,	1
and	1
was	1
now	1
rising	1
again.	1
The	1
higher	1
and	1
higher	1
it	1
rose	1
the	1
broader	1
and	1
broader	1
became	1
the	1
scenes	1
of	1
flame	1
and	1
desolation	1
underneath.	1
Ludgate	1
Hill	1
indeed	1
had	1
been	1
an	1
uncaptured	1
and	1
comparatively	1
quiet	1
height,	1
altered	1
only	1
by	1
the	1
startling	1
coincidence	1
of	1
the	1
cross	1
fallen	1
awry.	1
All	1
the	1
other	1
thoroughfares	1
on	1
all	1
sides	1
of	1
that	1
hill	1
were	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
pulsation	1
and	1
the	1
pain	1
of	1
battle,	1
full	1
of	1
shaking	1
torches	1
and	1
shouting	1
faces.	1
When	1
at	1
length	1
they	1
had	1
risen	1
high	1
enough	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
bird's-eye	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
campaign,	1
Turnbull	1
was	1
already	1
intoxicated.	1
He	1
had	1
smelt	1
gunpowder,	1
which	1
was	1
the	1
incense	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
revolutionary	1
religion.	1
"Have	1
the	1
people	1
really	1
risen?"	1
he	1
asked,	1
breathlessly.	1
"What	1
are	1
they	1
fighting	1
about?"	1
"The	1
programme	1
is	1
rather	1
elaborate,"	1
said	1
his	1
entertainer	1
with	1
some	1
indifference.	1
"I	1
think	1
Dr.	1
Hertz	1
drew	1
it	1
up."	1
Turnbull	1
wrinkled	1
his	1
forehead.	1
"Are	1
all	1
the	1
poor	1
people	1
with	1
the	1
Revolution?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
The	1
other	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders.	1
"All	1
the	1
instructed	1
and	1
class-conscious	1
part	1
of	1
them	1
without	1
exception,"	1
he	1
replied.	1
"There	1
were	1
certainly	1
a	1
few	1
districts;	1
in	1
fact,	1
we	1
are	1
passing	1
over	1
them	1
just	1
now----"	1
Turnbull	1
looked	1
down	1
and	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
polished	1
car	1
was	1
literally	1
lit	1
up	1
from	1
underneath	1
by	1
the	1
far-flung	1
fires	1
from	1
below.	1
Underneath	1
whole	1
squares	1
and	1
solid	1
districts	1
were	1
in	1
flames,	1
like	1
prairies	1
or	1
forests	1
on	1
fire.	1
"Dr.	1
Hertz	1
has	1
convinced	1
everybody,"	1
said	1
Turnbull's	1
cicerone	1
in	1
a	1
smooth	1
voice,	1
"that	1
nothing	1
can	1
really	1
be	1
done	1
with	1
the	1
real	1
slums.	1
His	1
celebrated	1
maxim	1
has	1
been	1
quite	1
adopted.	1
I	1
mean	1
the	1
three	1
celebrated	1
sentences:	1
'No	1
man	1
should	1
be	1
unemployed.	1
Employ	1
the	1
employables.	1
Destroy	1
the	1
unemployables.'"	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
silence,	1
and	1
then	1
Turnbull	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
rather	1
strained	1
voice:	1
"And	1
do	1
I	1
understand	1
that	1
this	1
good	1
work	1
is	1
going	1
on	1
under	1
here?"	1
"Going	1
on	1
splendidly,"	1
replied	1
his	1
companion	1
in	1
the	1
heartiest	1
voice.	1
"You	1
see,	1
these	1
people	1
were	1
much	1
too	1
tired	1
and	1
weak	1
even	1
to	1
join	1
the	1
social	1
war.	1
They	1
were	1
a	1
definite	1
hindrance	1
to	1
it."	1
"And	1
so	1
you	1
are	1
simply	1
burning	1
them	1
out?"	1
"It	1
_does_	1
seem	1
absurdly	1
simple,"	1
said	1
the	1
man,	1
with	1
a	1
beaming	1
smile,	1
"when	1
one	1
thinks	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
worry	1
and	1
talk	1
about	1
helping	1
a	1
hopeless	1
slave	1
population,	1
when	1
the	1
future	1
obviously	1
was	1
only	1
crying	1
to	1
be	1
rid	1
of	1
them.	1
There	1
are	1
happy	1
babes	1
unborn	1
ready	1
to	1
burst	1
the	1
doors	1
when	1
these	1
drivellers	1
are	1
swept	1
away."	1
"Will	1
you	1
permit	1
me	1
to	1
say,"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
after	1
reflection,	1
"that	1
I	1
don't	1
like	1
all	1
this?"	1
"And	1
will	1
you	1
permit	1
me	1
to	1
say,"	1
said	1
the	1
other,	1
with	1
a	1
snap,	1
"that	1
I	1
don't	1
like	1
Mr.	1
Evan	1
MacIan?"	1
Somewhat	1
to	1
the	1
speaker's	1
surprise	1
this	1
did	1
not	1
inflame	1
the	1
sensitive	1
sceptic;	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
air	1
of	1
thinking	1
thoroughly,	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
said:	1
"No,	1
I	1
don't	1
think	1
it's	1
my	1
friend	1
MacIan	1
that	1
taught	1
me	1
that.	1
I	1
think	1
I	1
should	1
always	1
have	1
said	1
that	1
I	1
don't	1
like	1
this.	1
These	1
people	1
have	1
rights."	1
"Rights!"	1
repeated	1
the	1
unknown	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
quite	1
indescribable.	1
Then	1
he	1
added	1
with	1
a	1
more	1
open	1
sneer:	1
"Perhaps	1
they	1
also	1
have	1
souls."	1
"They	1
have	1
lives!"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
sternly;	1
"that	1
is	1
quite	1
enough	1
for	1
me.	1
I	1
understood	1
you	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
you	1
thought	1
life	1
sacred."	1
"Yes,	1
indeed!"	1
cried	1
his	1
mentor	1
with	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
idealistic	1
animation.	1
"Yes,	1
indeed!	1
Life	1
is	1
sacred--but	1
lives	1
are	1
not	1
sacred.	1
We	1
are	1
improving	1
Life	1
by	1
removing	1
lives.	1
Can	1
you,	1
as	1
a	1
free-thinker,	1
find	1
any	1
fault	1
in	1
that?"	1
"Yes,"	1
said	1
Turnbull	1
with	1
brevity.	1
"Yet	1
you	1
applaud	1
tyrannicide,"	1
said	1
the	1
stranger	1
with	1
rationalistic	1
gaiety.	1
"How	1
inconsistent!	1
It	1
really	1
comes	1
to	1
this:	1
You	1
approve	1
of	1
taking	1
away	1
life	1
from	1
those	1
to	1
whom	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
triumph	1
and	1
a	1
pleasure.	1
But	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
take	1
away	1
life	1
from	1
those	1
to	1
whom	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
burden	1
and	1
a	1
toil."	1
Turnbull	1
rose	1
to	1
his	1
feet	1
in	1
the	1
car	1
with	1
considerable	1
deliberation,	1
but	1
his	1
face	1
seemed	1
oddly	1
pale.	1
The	1
other	1
went	1
on	1
with	1
enthusiasm.	1
"Life,	1
yes,	1
Life	1
is	1
indeed	1
sacred!"	1
he	1
cried;	1
"but	1
new	1
lives	1
for	1
old!	1
Good	1
lives	1
for	1
bad!	1
On	1
that	1
very	1
place	1
where	1
now	1
there	1
sprawls	1
one	1
drunken	1
wastrel	1
of	1
a	1
pavement	1
artist	1
more	1
or	1
less	1
wishing	1
he	1
were	1
dead--on	1
that	1
very	1
spot	1
there	1
shall	1
in	1
the	1
future	1
be	1
living	1
pictures;	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
golden	1
girls	1
and	1
boys	1
leaping	1
in	1
the	1
sun."	1
Turnbull,	1
still	1
standing	1
up,	1
opened	1
his	1
lips.	1
"Will	1
you	1
put	1
me	1
down,	1
please?"	1
he	1
said,	1
quite	1
calmly,	1
like	1
on	1
stopping	1
an	1
omnibus.	1
"Put	1
you	1
down--what	1
do	1
you	1
mean?"	1
cried	1
his	1
leader.	1
"I	1
am	1
taking	1
you	1
to	1
the	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
revolutionary	1
war,	1
where	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
of	1
the	1
revolutionary	1
leaders."	1
"Thank	1
you,"	1
replied	1
Turnbull	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
painful	1
constraint.	1
"I	1
have	1
heard	1
about	1
your	1
revolutionary	1
war,	1
and	1
I	1
think	1
on	1
the	1
whole	1
that	1
I	1
would	1
rather	1
be	1
anywhere	1
else."	1
"Do	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
be	1
taken	1
to	1
a	1
monastery,"	1
snarled	1
the	1
other,	1
"with	1
MacIan	1
and	1
his	1
winking	1
Madonnas."	1
"I	1
want	1
to	1
be	1
taken	1
to	1
a	1
madhouse,"	1
said	1
Turnbull	1
distinctly,	1
giving	1
the	1
direction	1
with	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
precision.	1
"I	1
want	1
to	1
go	1
back	1
to	1
exactly	1
the	1
same	1
lunatic	1
asylum	1
from	1
which	1
I	1
came."	1
"Why?"	1
asked	1
the	1
unknown.	1
"Because	1
I	1
want	1
a	1
little	1
sane	1
and	1
wholesome	1
society,"	1
answered	1
Turnbull.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
long	1
and	1
peculiar	1
silence,	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
man	1
driving	1
the	1
flying	1
machine	1
said	1
quite	1
coolly:	1
"I	1
won't	1
take	1
you	1
back."	1
And	1
then	1
Turnbull	1
said	1
equally	1
coolly:	1
"Then	1
I'll	1
jump	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
car."	1
The	1
unknown	1
rose	1
to	1
his	1
full	1
height,	1
and	1
the	1
expression	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
made	1
of	1
ironies	1
behind	1
ironies,	1
as	1
two	1
mirrors	1
infinitely	1
reflect	1
each	1
other.	1
At	1
last	1
he	1
said,	1
very	1
gravely:	1
"Do	1
you	1
think	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
devil?"	1
"Yes,"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
violently.	1
"For	1
I	1
think	1
the	1
devil	1
is	1
a	1
dream,	1
and	1
so	1
are	1
you.	1
I	1
don't	1
believe	1
in	1
you	1
or	1
your	1
flying	1
ship	1
or	1
your	1
last	1
fight	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
It	1
is	1
all	1
a	1
nightmare.	1
I	1
say	1
as	1
a	1
fact	1
of	1
dogma	1
and	1
faith	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
all	1
a	1
nightmare.	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
martyr	1
for	1
my	1
faith	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
St.	1
Catherine,	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
jump	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
ship	1
and	1
risk	1
waking	1
up	1
safe	1
in	1
bed."	1
After	1
swaying	1
twice	1
with	1
the	1
swaying	1
vessel	1
he	1
dived	1
over	1
the	1
side	1
as	1
one	1
dives	1
into	1
the	1
sea.	1
For	1
some	1
incredible	1
moments	1
stars	1
and	1
space	1
and	1
planets	1
seemed	1
to	1
shoot	1
up	1
past	1
him	1
as	1
the	1
sparks	1
fly	1
upward;	1
and	1
yet	1
in	1
that	1
sickening	1
descent	1
he	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
some	1
unnatural	1
happiness.	1
He	1
could	1
connect	1
it	1
with	1
no	1
idea	1
except	1
one	1
that	1
half	1
escaped	1
him--what	1
Evan	1
had	1
said	1
of	1
the	1
difference	1
between	1
Christ	1
and	1
Satan;	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
by	1
Christ's	1
own	1
choice	1
that	1
He	1
descended	1
into	1
hell.	1
When	1
he	1
again	1
realized	1
anything,	1
he	1
was	1
lying	1
on	1
his	1
elbow	1
on	1
the	1
lawn	1
of	1
the	1
lunatic	1
asylum,	1
and	1
the	1
last	1
red	1
of	1
the	1
sunset	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
disappeared.	1
XVII.	1
THE	1
IDIOT	1
Evan	1
MacIan	1
was	1
standing	1
a	1
few	1
yards	1
off	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
in	1
absolute	1
silence.	1
He	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
moral	1
courage	1
to	1
ask	1
MacIan	1
if	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
anything	1
astounding	1
in	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
his	1
coming	1
there,	1
nor	1
did	1
MacIan	1
seem	1
to	1
have	1
any	1
question	1
to	1
ask,	1
or	1
perhaps	1
any	1
need	1
to	1
ask	1
it.	1
The	1
two	1
men	1
came	1
slowly	1
towards	1
each	1
other,	1
and	1
found	1
the	1
same	1
expression	1
on	1
each	1
other's	1
faces.	1
Then,	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
in	1
all	1
their	1
acquaintance,	1
they	1
shook	1
hands.	1
Almost	1
as	1
if	1
this	1
were	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
unconscious	1
signal,	1
it	1
brought	1
Dr.	1
Quayle	1
bounding	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
door	1
and	1
running	1
across	1
the	1
lawn.	1
"Oh,	1
there	1
you	1
are!"	1
he	1
exclaimed	1
with	1
a	1
relieved	1
giggle.	1
"Will	1
you	1
come	1
inside,	1
please?	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
you	1
both."	1
They	1
followed	1
him	1
into	1
his	1
shiny	1
wooden	1
office	1
where	1
their	1
damning	1
record	1
was	1
kept.	1
Dr.	1
Quayle	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
a	1
swivel	1
chair	1
and	1
swung	1
round	1
to	1
face	1
them.	1
His	1
carved	1
smile	1
had	1
suddenly	1
disappeared.	1
"I	1
will	1
be	1
plain	1
with	1
you	1
gentlemen,"	1
he	1
said,	1
abruptly;	1
"you	1
know	1
quite	1
well	1
we	1
do	1
our	1
best	1
for	1
everybody	1
here.	1
Your	1
cases	1
have	1
been	1
under	1
special	1
consideration,	1
and	1
the	1
Master	1
himself	1
has	1
decided	1
that	1
you	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
treated	1
specially	1
and--er--under	1
somewhat	1
simpler	1
conditions."	1
"You	1
mean	1
treated	1
worse,	1
I	1
suppose,"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
gruffly.	1
The	1
doctor	1
did	1
not	1
reply,	1
and	1
MacIan	1
said:	1
"I	1
expected	1
this."	1
His	1
eyes	1
had	1
begun	1
to	1
glow.	1
The	1
doctor	1
answered,	1
looking	1
at	1
his	1
desk	1
and	1
playing	1
with	1
a	1
key:	1
"Well,	1
in	1
certain	1
cases	1
that	1
give	1
anxiety--it	1
is	1
often	1
better----"	1
"Give	1
anxiety,"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
fiercely.	1
"Confound	1
your	1
impudence!	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
mean?	1
You	1
imprison	1
two	1
perfectly	1
sane	1
men	1
in	1
a	1
madhouse	1
because	1
you	1
have	1
made	1
up	1
a	1
long	1
word.	1
They	1
take	1
it	1
in	1
good	1
temper,	1
walk	1
and	1
talk	1
in	1
your	1
garden	1
like	1
monks	1
who	1
have	1
found	1
a	1
vocation,	1
are	1
civil	1
even	1
to	1
you,	1
you	1
damned	1
druggists'	1
hack!	1
Behave	1
not	1
only	1
more	1
sanely	1
than	1
any	1
of	1
your	1
patients,	1
but	1
more	1
sanely	1
than	1
half	1
the	1
sane	1
men	1
outside,	1
and	1
you	1
have	1
the	1
soul-stifling	1
cheek	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
they	1
give	1
anxiety."	1
"The	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
asylum	1
has	1
settled	1
it	1
all,"	1
said	1
Dr.	1
Quayle,	1
still	1
looking	1
down.	1
MacIan	1
took	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
immense	1
strides	1
forward	1
and	1
stood	1
over	1
the	1
doctor	1
with	1
flaming	1
eyes.	1
"If	1
the	1
head	1
has	1
settled	1
it	1
let	1
the	1
head	1
announce	1
it,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"I	1
won't	1
take	1
it	1
from	1
you.	1
I	1
believe	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
low,	1
gibbering	1
degenerate.	1
Let	1
us	1
see	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
asylum."	1
"See	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
asylum,"	1
repeated	1
Dr.	1
Quayle.	1
"Certainly	1
not."	1
The	1
tall	1
Highlander,	1
bending	1
over	1
him,	1
put	1
one	1
hand	1
on	1
his	1
shoulder	1
with	1
fatherly	1
interest.	1
"You	1
don't	1
seem	1
to	1
appreciate	1
the	1
peculiar	1
advantages	1
of	1
my	1
position	1
as	1
a	1
lunatic,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"I	1
could	1
kill	1
you	1
with	1
my	1
left	1
hand	1
before	1
such	1
a	1
rat	1
as	1
you	1
could	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
squeak.	1
And	1
I	1
wouldn't	1
be	1
hanged	1
for	1
it."	1
"I	1
certainly	1
agree	1
with	1
Mr.	1
MacIan,"	1
said	1
Turnbull	1
with	1
sobriety	1
and	1
perfect	1
respectfulness,	1
"that	1
you	1
had	1
better	1
let	1
us	1
see	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
institution."	1
Dr.	1
Quayle	1
got	1
to	1
his	1
feet	1
in	1
a	1
mixture	1
of	1
sudden	1
hysteria	1
and	1
clumsy	1
presence	1
of	1
mind.	1
"Oh,	1
certainly,"	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
weak	1
laugh.	1
"You	1
can	1
see	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
asylum	1
if	1
you	1
particularly	1
want	1
to."	1
He	1
almost	1
ran	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room,	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
followed	1
swiftly	1
on	1
his	1
flying	1
coat	1
tails.	1
He	1
knocked	1
at	1
an	1
ordinary	1
varnished	1
door	1
in	1
the	1
corridor.	1
When	1
a	1
voice	1
said,	1
"Come	1
in,"	1
MacIan's	1
breath	1
went	1
hissing	1
back	1
through	1
his	1
teeth	1
into	1
his	1
chest.	1
Turnbull	1
was	1
more	1
impetuous,	1
and	1
opened	1
the	1
door.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
neat	1
and	1
well-appointed	1
room	1
entirely	1
lined	1
with	1
a	1
medical	1
library.	1
At	1
the	1
other	1
end	1
of	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
ponderous	1
and	1
polished	1
desk	1
with	1
an	1
incandescent	1
lamp	1
on	1
it,	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
which	1
was	1
just	1
sufficient	1
to	1
show	1
a	1
slender,	1
well-bred	1
figure	1
in	1
an	1
ordinary	1
medical	1
black	1
frock-coat,	1
whose	1
head,	1
quite	1
silvered	1
with	1
age,	1
was	1
bent	1
over	1
neat	1
piles	1
of	1
notes.	1
This	1
gentleman	1
looked	1
up	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
as	1
they	1
entered,	1
and	1
the	1
lamplight	1
fell	1
on	1
his	1
glittering	1
spectacles	1
and	1
long,	1
clean-shaven	1
face--a	1
face	1
which	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
simply	1
like	1
an	1
aristocrat's	1
but	1
that	1
a	1
certain	1
lion	1
poise	1
of	1
the	1
head	1
and	1
long	1
cleft	1
in	1
the	1
chin	1
made	1
it	1
look	1
more	1
like	1
a	1
very	1
handsome	1
actor's.	1
It	1
was	1
only	1
for	1
a	1
flash	1
that	1
his	1
face	1
was	1
thus	1
lifted.	1
Then	1
he	1
bent	1
his	1
silver	1
head	1
over	1
his	1
notes	1
once	1
more,	1
and	1
said,	1
without	1
looking	1
up	1
again:	1
"I	1
told	1
you,	1
Dr.	1
Quayle,	1
that	1
these	1
men	1
were	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
cells	1
B	1
and	1
C."	1
Turnbull	1
and	1
MacIan	1
looked	1
at	1
each	1
other,	1
and	1
said	1
more	1
than	1
they	1
could	1
ever	1
say	1
with	1
tongues	1
or	1
swords.	1
Among	1
other	1
things	1
they	1
said	1
that	1
to	1
that	1
particular	1
Head	1
of	1
the	1
institution	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
waste	1
of	1
time	1
to	1
appeal,	1
and	1
they	1
followed	1
Dr.	1
Quayle	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room.	1
The	1
instant	1
they	1
stepped	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
corridor	1
four	1
sturdy	1
figures	1
stepped	1
from	1
four	1
sides,	1
pinioned	1
them,	1
and	1
ran	1
them	1
along	1
the	1
galleries.	1
They	1
might	1
very	1
likely	1
have	1
thrown	1
their	1
captors	1
right	1
and	1
left	1
had	1
they	1
been	1
inclined	1
to	1
resist,	1
but	1
for	1
some	1
nameless	1
reason	1
they	1
were	1
more	1
inclined	1
to	1
laugh.	1
A	1
mixture	1
of	1
mad	1
irony	1
with	1
childish	1
curiosity	1
made	1
them	1
feel	1
quite	1
inclined	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
next	1
twist	1
would	1
be	1
taken	1
by	1
their	1
imbecile	1
luck.	1
They	1
were	1
dragged	1
down	1
countless	1
cold	1
avenues	1
lined	1
with	1
glazed	1
tiles,	1
different	1
only	1
in	1
being	1
of	1
different	1
lengths	1
and	1
set	1
at	1
different	1
angles.	1
They	1
were	1
so	1
many	1
and	1
so	1
monotonous	1
that	1
to	1
escape	1
back	1
by	1
them	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
far	1
harder	1
than	1
fleeing	1
from	1
the	1
Hampton	1
Court	1
maze.	1
Only	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
windows	1
grew	1
fewer,	1
coming	1
at	1
longer	1
intervals,	1
and	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
windows	1
did	1
come	1
they	1
seemed	1
shadowed	1
and	1
let	1
in	1
less	1
light,	1
showed	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
winding	1
into	1
the	1
core	1
or	1
belly	1
of	1
some	1
enormous	1
building.	1
After	1
a	1
little	1
time	1
the	1
glazed	1
corridors	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
lit	1
by	1
electricity.	1
At	1
last,	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
walked	1
nearly	1
a	1
mile	1
in	1
those	1
white	1
and	1
polished	1
tunnels,	1
they	1
came	1
with	1
quite	1
a	1
shock	1
to	1
the	1
futile	1
finality	1
of	1
a	1
cul-de-sac.	1
All	1
that	1
white	1
and	1
weary	1
journey	1
ended	1
suddenly	1
in	1
an	1
oblong	1
space	1
and	1
a	1
blank	1
white	1
wall.	1
But	1
in	1
the	1
white	1
wall	1
there	1
were	1
two	1
iron	1
doors	1
painted	1
white	1
on	1
which	1
were	1
written,	1
respectively,	1
in	1
neat	1
black	1
capitals	1
B	1
and	1
C.	1
"You	1
go	1
in	1
here,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
the	1
leader	1
of	1
the	1
officials,	1
quite	1
respectfully,	1
"and	1
you	1
in	1
here."	1
But	1
before	1
the	1
doors	1
had	1
clanged	1
upon	1
their	1
dazed	1
victims,	1
MacIan	1
had	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
Turnbull	1
with	1
a	1
strange	1
drawl	1
of	1
significance:	1
"I	1
wonder	1
who	1
A	1
is."	1
Turnbull	1
made	1
an	1
automatic	1
struggle	1
before	1
he	1
allowed	1
himself	1
to	1
be	1
thrown	1
into	1
the	1
cell.	1
Hence	1
it	1
happened	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
last	1
to	1
enter,	1
and	1
was	1
still	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
exhilaration	1
of	1
the	1
adventures	1
for	1
at	1
least	1
five	1
minutes	1
after	1
the	1
echo	1
of	1
the	1
clanging	1
door	1
had	1
died	1
away.	1
Then,	1
when	1
silence	1
had	1
sunk	1
deep	1
and	1
nothing	1
happened	1
for	1
two	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
hours,	1
it	1
suddenly	1
occurred	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
his	1
life.	1
He	1
was	1
hidden	1
and	1
sealed	1
up	1
in	1
this	1
little	1
crack	1
of	1
stone	1
until	1
the	1
flesh	1
should	1
fall	1
off	1
his	1
bones.	1
He	1
was	1
dead,	1
and	1
the	1
world	1
had	1
won.	1
His	1
cell	1
was	1
of	1
an	1
oblong	1
shape,	1
but	1
very	1
long	1
in	1
comparison	1
with	1
its	1
width.	1
It	1
was	1
just	1
wide	1
enough	1
to	1
permit	1
the	1
arms	1
to	1
be	1
fully	1
extended	1
with	1
the	1
dumb-bells,	1
which	1
were	1
hung	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
wall,	1
very	1
dusty.	1
It	1
was,	1
however,	1
long	1
enough	1
for	1
a	1
man	1
to	1
walk	1
one	1
thirty-fifth	1
part	1
of	1
a	1
mile	1
if	1
he	1
traversed	1
it	1
entirely.	1
On	1
the	1
same	1
principle	1
a	1
row	1
of	1
fixed	1
holes,	1
quite	1
close	1
together,	1
let	1
in	1
to	1
the	1
cells	1
by	1
pipes	1
what	1
was	1
alleged	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
freshest	1
air.	1
For	1
these	1
great	1
scientific	1
organizers	1
insisted	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
should	1
be	1
healthy	1
even	1
if	1
he	1
was	1
miserable.	1
They	1
provided	1
a	1
walk	1
long	1
enough	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
exercise	1
and	1
holes	1
large	1
enough	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
oxygen.	1
There	1
their	1
interest	1
in	1
human	1
nature	1
suddenly	1
ceased.	1
It	1
seemed	1
never	1
to	1
have	1
occurred	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
the	1
benefit	1
of	1
exercise	1
belongs	1
partly	1
to	1
the	1
benefit	1
of	1
liberty.	1
They	1
had	1
not	1
entertained	1
the	1
suggestion	1
that	1
the	1
open	1
air	1
is	1
only	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
advantages	1
of	1
the	1
open	1
sky.	1
They	1
administered	1
air	1
in	1
secret,	1
but	1
in	1
sufficient	1
doses,	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
medicine.	1
They	1
suggested	1
walking,	1
as	1
if	1
no	1
man	1
had	1
ever	1
felt	1
inclined	1
to	1
walk.	1
Above	1
all,	1
the	1
asylum	1
authorities	1
insisted	1
on	1
their	1
own	1
extraordinary	1
cleanliness.	1
Every	1
morning,	1
while	1
Turnbull	1
was	1
still	1
half	1
asleep	1
on	1
his	1
iron	1
bedstead	1
which	1
was	1
lifted	1
half-way	1
up	1
the	1
wall	1
and	1
clamped	1
to	1
it	1
with	1
iron,	1
four	1
sluices	1
or	1
metal	1
mouths	1
opened	1
above	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
four	1
corners	1
of	1
the	1
chamber	1
and	1
washed	1
it	1
white	1
of	1
any	1
defilement.	1
Turnbull's	1
solitary	1
soul	1
surged	1
up	1
against	1
this	1
sickening	1
daily	1
solemnity.	1
"I	1
am	1
buried	1
alive!"	1
he	1
cried,	1
bitterly;	1
"they	1
have	1
hidden	1
me	1
under	1
mountains.	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
here	1
till	1
I	1
rot.	1
Why	1
the	1
blazes	1
should	1
it	1
matter	1
to	1
them	1
whether	1
I	1
am	1
dirty	1
or	1
clean."	1
Every	1
morning	1
and	1
evening	1
an	1
iron	1
hatchway	1
opened	1
in	1
his	1
oblong	1
cell,	1
and	1
a	1
brown	1
hairy	1
hand	1
or	1
two	1
thrust	1
in	1
a	1
plate	1
of	1
perfectly	1
cooked	1
lentils	1
and	1
a	1
big	1
bowl	1
of	1
cocoa.	1
He	1
was	1
not	1
underfed	1
any	1
more	1
than	1
he	1
was	1
underexercised	1
or	1
asphyxiated.	1
He	1
had	1
ample	1
walking	1
space,	1
ample	1
air,	1
ample	1
and	1
even	1
filling	1
food.	1
The	1
only	1
objection	1
was	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
nothing	1
to	1
walk	1
towards,	1
nothing	1
to	1
feast	1
about,	1
and	1
no	1
reason	1
whatever	1
for	1
drawing	1
the	1
breath	1
of	1
life.	1
Even	1
the	1
shape	1
of	1
his	1
cell	1
especially	1
irritated	1
him.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
long,	1
narrow	1
parallelogram,	1
which	1
had	1
a	1
flat	1
wall	1
at	1
one	1
end	1
and	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
had	1
a	1
flat	1
wall	1
at	1
the	1
other;	1
but	1
that	1
end	1
was	1
broken	1
by	1
a	1
wedge	1
or	1
angle	1
of	1
space,	1
like	1
the	1
prow	1
of	1
a	1
ship.	1
After	1
three	1
days	1
of	1
silence	1
and	1
cocoa,	1
this	1
angle	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
began	1
to	1
infuriate	1
Turnbull.	1
It	1
maddened	1
him	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
two	1
lines	1
came	1
together	1
and	1
pointed	1
at	1
nothing.	1
After	1
the	1
fifth	1
day	1
he	1
was	1
reckless,	1
and	1
poked	1
his	1
head	1
into	1
the	1
corner.	1
After	1
twenty-five	1
days	1
he	1
almost	1
broke	1
his	1
head	1
against	1
it.	1
Then	1
he	1
became	1
quite	1
cool	1
and	1
stupid	1
again,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
examine	1
it	1
like	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
Robinson	1
Crusoe.	1
Almost	1
unconsciously	1
it	1
was	1
his	1
instinct	1
to	1
examine	1
outlets,	1
and	1
he	1
found	1
himself	1
paying	1
particular	1
attention	1
to	1
the	1
row	1
of	1
holes	1
which	1
let	1
in	1
the	1
air	1
into	1
his	1
last	1
house	1
of	1
life.	1
He	1
soon	1
discovered	1
that	1
these	1
air-holes	1
were	1
all	1
the	1
ends	1
and	1
mouths	1
of	1
long	1
leaden	1
tubes	1
which	1
doubtless	1
carried	1
air	1
from	1
some	1
remote	1
watering-place	1
near	1
Margate.	1
One	1
evening	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
engaged	1
in	1
the	1
fifth	1
investigation	1
he	1
noticed	1
something	1
like	1
twilight	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
dumb	1
mouths,	1
as	1
compared	1
with	1
the	1
darkness	1
of	1
the	1
others.	1
Thrusting	1
his	1
finger	1
in	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
it	1
would	1
go,	1
he	1
found	1
a	1
hole	1
and	1
flapping	1
edge	1
in	1
the	1
tube.	1
This	1
he	1
rent	1
open	1
and	1
instantly	1
saw	1
a	1
light	1
behind;	1
it	1
was	1
at	1
least	1
certain	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
struck	1
some	1
other	1
cell.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
characteristic	1
of	1
all	1
things	1
now	1
called	1
"efficient",	1
which	1
means	1
mechanical	1
and	1
calculated,	1
that	1
if	1
they	1
go	1
wrong	1
at	1
all	1
they	1
go	1
entirely	1
wrong.	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
power	1
of	1
retrieving	1
a	1
defeat,	1
as	1
in	1
simpler	1
and	1
more	1
living	1
organisms.	1
A	1
strong	1
gun	1
can	1
conquer	1
a	1
strong	1
elephant,	1
but	1
a	1
wounded	1
elephant	1
can	1
easily	1
conquer	1
a	1
broken	1
gun.	1
Thus	1
the	1
Prussian	1
monarchy	1
in	1
the	1
eighteenth	1
century,	1
or	1
now,	1
can	1
make	1
a	1
strong	1
army	1
merely	1
by	1
making	1
the	1
men	1
afraid.	1
But	1
it	1
does	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
permanent	1
possibility	1
that	1
the	1
men	1
may	1
some	1
day	1
be	1
more	1
afraid	1
of	1
their	1
enemies	1
than	1
of	1
their	1
officers.	1
Thus	1
the	1
drainage	1
in	1
our	1
cities	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
quite	1
solid	1
means	1
a	1
general	1
safety,	1
but	1
if	1
there	1
is	1
one	1
leak	1
it	1
means	1
concentrated	1
poison--an	1
explosion	1
of	1
deathly	1
germs	1
like	1
dynamite,	1
a	1
spirit	1
of	1
stink.	1
Thus,	1
indeed,	1
all	1
that	1
excellent	1
machinery	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
swiftest	1
thing	1
on	1
earth	1
in	1
saving	1
human	1
labour	1
is	1
also	1
the	1
slowest	1
thing	1
on	1
earth	1
in	1
resisting	1
human	1
interference.	1
It	1
may	1
be	1
easier	1
to	1
get	1
chocolate	1
for	1
nothing	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
shopkeeper	1
than	1
out	1
of	1
an	1
automatic	1
machine.	1
But	1
if	1
you	1
did	1
manage	1
to	1
steal	1
the	1
chocolate,	1
the	1
automatic	1
machine	1
would	1
be	1
much	1
less	1
likely	1
to	1
run	1
after	1
you.	1
Turnbull	1
was	1
not	1
long	1
in	1
discovering	1
this	1
truth	1
in	1
connexion	1
with	1
the	1
cold	1
and	1
colossal	1
machinery	1
of	1
this	1
great	1
asylum.	1
He	1
had	1
been	1
shaken	1
by	1
many	1
spiritual	1
states	1
since	1
the	1
instant	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
pitched	1
head	1
foremost	1
into	1
that	1
private	1
cell	1
which	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
his	1
private	1
room	1
till	1
death.	1
He	1
had	1
felt	1
a	1
high	1
fit	1
of	1
pride	1
and	1
poetry,	1
which	1
had	1
ebbed	1
away	1
and	1
left	1
him	1
deadly	1
cold.	1
He	1
had	1
known	1
a	1
period	1
of	1
mere	1
scientific	1
curiosity,	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
examined	1
all	1
the	1
tiles	1
of	1
his	1
cell,	1
with	1
the	1
gratifying	1
conclusion	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
shape	1
and	1
size;	1
but	1
was	1
greatly	1
puzzled	1
about	1
the	1
angle	1
in	1
the	1
wall	1
at	1
the	1
end,	1
and	1
also	1
about	1
an	1
iron	1
peg	1
or	1
spike	1
that	1
stood	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
wall,	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
know	1
to	1
this	1
day.	1
Then	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
period	1
of	1
mere	1
madness	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
written	1
of	1
by	1
decent	1
men,	1
but	1
only	1
by	1
those	1
few	1
dirty	1
novelists	1
hallooed	1
on	1
by	1
the	1
infernal	1
huntsman	1
to	1
hunt	1
down	1
and	1
humiliate	1
human	1
nature.	1
This	1
also	1
passed,	1
but	1
left	1
behind	1
it	1
a	1
feverish	1
distaste	1
for	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
mere	1
objects	1
around	1
him.	1
Long	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
returned	1
to	1
sanity	1
and	1
such	1
hopeless	1
cheerfulness	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
might	1
have	1
on	1
a	1
desert	1
island,	1
he	1
disliked	1
the	1
regular	1
squares	1
of	1
the	1
pattern	1
of	1
wall	1
and	1
floor	1
and	1
the	1
triangle	1
that	1
terminated	1
his	1
corridor.	1
Above	1
all,	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
hatred,	1
deep	1
as	1
the	1
hell	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
believe	1
in,	1
for	1
the	1
objectless	1
iron	1
peg	1
in	1
the	1
wall.	1
But	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
moods,	1
sane	1
or	1
insane,	1
intolerant	1
or	1
stoical,	1
he	1
never	1
really	1
doubted	1
this:	1
that	1
the	1
machine	1
held	1
him	1
as	1
light	1
and	1
as	1
hopelessly	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
from	1
his	1
birth	1
been	1
held	1
by	1
the	1
hopeless	1
cosmos	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
creed.	1
He	1
knew	1
well	1
the	1
ruthless	1
and	1
inexhaustible	1
resources	1
of	1
our	1
scientific	1
civilization.	1
He	1
no	1
more	1
expected	1
rescue	1
from	1
a	1
medical	1
certificate	1
than	1
rescue	1
from	1
the	1
solar	1
system.	1
In	1
many	1
of	1
his	1
Robinson	1
Crusoe	1
moods	1
he	1
thought	1
kindly	1
of	1
MacIan	1
as	1
of	1
some	1
quarrelsome	1
school-fellow	1
who	1
had	1
long	1
been	1
dead.	1
He	1
thought	1
of	1
leaving	1
in	1
the	1
cell	1
when	1
he	1
died	1
a	1
rigid	1
record	1
of	1
his	1
opinions,	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
write	1
them	1
down	1
on	1
scraps	1
of	1
envelope	1
in	1
his	1
pocket,	1
he	1
was	1
startled	1
to	1
discover	1
how	1
much	1
they	1
had	1
changed.	1
Then	1
he	1
remembered	1
the	1
Beauchamp	1
Tower,	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
write	1
his	1
blazing	1
scepticism	1
on	1
the	1
wall,	1
and	1
discovered	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
shiny	1
tiles	1
on	1
which	1
nothing	1
could	1
be	1
either	1
drawn	1
or	1
carved.	1
Then	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
there	1
hung	1
and	1
broke	1
above	1
him	1
like	1
a	1
high	1
wave	1
the	1
whole	1
horror	1
of	1
scientific	1
imprisonment,	1
which	1
manages	1
to	1
deny	1
a	1
man	1
not	1
only	1
liberty,	1
but	1
every	1
accidental	1
comfort	1
of	1
bondage.	1
In	1
the	1
old	1
filthy	1
dungeons	1
men	1
could	1
carve	1
their	1
prayers	1
or	1
protests	1
in	1
the	1
rock.	1
Here	1
the	1
white	1
and	1
slippery	1
walls	1
escaped	1
even	1
from	1
bearing	1
witness.	1
The	1
old	1
prisoners	1
could	1
make	1
a	1
pet	1
of	1
a	1
mouse	1
or	1
a	1
beetle	1
strayed	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
hole.	1
Here	1
the	1
unpierceable	1
walls	1
were	1
washed	1
every	1
morning	1
by	1
an	1
automatic	1
sluice.	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
natural	1
corruption	1
and	1
no	1
merciful	1
decay	1
by	1
which	1
a	1
living	1
thing	1
could	1
enter	1
in.	1
Then	1
James	1
Turnbull	1
looked	1
up	1
and	1
saw	1
the	1
high	1
invincible	1
hatefulness	1
of	1
the	1
society	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
lived,	1
and	1
saw	1
the	1
hatefulness	1
of	1
something	1
else	1
also,	1
which	1
he	1
told	1
himself	1
again	1
and	1
again	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
cosmos	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
believed.	1
But	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
once	1
doubted	1
that	1
the	1
five	1
sides	1
of	1
his	1
cell	1
were	1
for	1
him	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
henceforward,	1
and	1
it	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
shock	1
of	1
surprise	1
even	1
to	1
discover	1
the	1
faint	1
light	1
through	1
the	1
aperture	1
in	1
the	1
ventilation	1
tube.	1
But	1
he	1
had	1
forgotten	1
how	1
close	1
efficiency	1
has	1
to	1
pack	1
everything	1
together	1
and	1
how	1
easily,	1
therefore,	1
a	1
pipe	1
here	1
or	1
there	1
may	1
leak.	1
Turnbull	1
thrust	1
his	1
first	1
finger	1
down	1
the	1
aperture,	1
and	1
at	1
last	1
managed	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
slight	1
further	1
fissure	1
in	1
the	1
piping.	1
The	1
light	1
that	1
came	1
up	1
from	1
beyond	1
was	1
very	1
faint,	1
and	1
apparently	1
indirect;	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
fall	1
from	1
some	1
hole	1
or	1
window	1
higher	1
up.	1
As	1
he	1
was	1
screwing	1
his	1
eye	1
to	1
peer	1
at	1
this	1
grey	1
and	1
greasy	1
twilight	1
he	1
was	1
astonished	1
to	1
see	1
another	1
human	1
finger	1
very	1
long	1
and	1
lean	1
come	1
down	1
from	1
above	1
towards	1
the	1
broken	1
pipe	1
and	1
hook	1
it	1
up	1
to	1
something	1
higher.	1
The	1
lighted	1
aperture	1
was	1
abruptly	1
blackened	1
and	1
blocked,	1
presumably	1
by	1
a	1
face	1
and	1
mouth,	1
for	1
something	1
human	1
spoke	1
down	1
the	1
tube,	1
though	1
the	1
words	1
were	1
not	1
clear.	1
"Who	1
is	1
that?"	1
asked	1
Turnbull,	1
trembling	1
with	1
excitement,	1
yet	1
wary	1
and	1
quite	1
resolved	1
not	1
to	1
spoil	1
any	1
chance.	1
After	1
a	1
few	1
indistinct	1
sounds	1
the	1
voice	1
came	1
down	1
with	1
a	1
strong	1
Argyllshire	1
accent:	1
"I	1
say,	1
Turnbull,	1
we	1
couldn't	1
fight	1
through	1
this	1
tube,	1
could	1
we?"	1
Sentiments	1
beyond	1
speech	1
surged	1
up	1
in	1
Turnbull	1
and	1
silenced	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
space	1
just	1
long	1
enough	1
to	1
be	1
painful.	1
Then	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
his	1
old	1
gaiety:	1
"I	1
vote	1
we	1
talk	1
a	1
little	1
first;	1
I	1
don't	1
want	1
to	1
murder	1
the	1
first	1
man	1
I	1
have	1
met	1
for	1
ten	1
million	1
years."	1
"I	1
know	1
what	1
you	1
mean,"	1
answered	1
the	1
other.	1
"It	1
has	1
been	1
awful.	1
For	1
a	1
mortal	1
month	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
alone	1
with	1
God."	1
Turnbull	1
started,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
tip	1
of	1
his	1
tongue	1
to	1
answer:	1
"Alone	1
with	1
God!	1
Then	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
loneliness	1
is."	1
But	1
he	1
answered,	1
after	1
all,	1
in	1
his	1
old	1
defiant	1
style:	1
"Alone	1
with	1
God,	1
were	1
you?	1
And	1
I	1
suppose	1
you	1
found	1
his	1
Majesty's	1
society	1
rather	1
monotonous?"	1
"Oh,	1
no,"	1
said	1
MacIan,	1
and	1
his	1
voice	1
shuddered;	1
"it	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
too	1
exciting."	1
After	1
a	1
very	1
long	1
silence	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
MacIan	1
said:	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
really	1
hate	1
most	1
in	1
your	1
place?"	1
"You'd	1
think	1
I	1
was	1
really	1
mad	1
if	1
I	1
told	1
you,"	1
answered	1
Turnbull,	1
bitterly.	1
"Then	1
I	1
expect	1
it's	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
mine,"	1
said	1
the	1
other	1
voice.	1
"I	1
am	1
sure	1
it's	1
not	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
anybody's,"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
"for	1
it	1
has	1
no	1
rhyme	1
or	1
reason.	1
Perhaps	1
my	1
brain	1
really	1
has	1
gone,	1
but	1
I	1
detest	1
that	1
iron	1
spike	1
in	1
the	1
left	1
wall	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
damned	1
desolation	1
or	1
the	1
damned	1
cocoa.	1
Have	1
you	1
got	1
one	1
in	1
your	1
cell?"	1
"Not	1
now,"	1
replied	1
MacIan	1
with	1
serenity.	1
"I've	1
pulled	1
it	1
out."	1
His	1
fellow-prisoner	1
could	1
only	1
repeat	1
the	1
words.	1
"I	1
pulled	1
it	1
out	1
the	1
other	1
day	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
off	1
my	1
head,"	1
continued	1
the	1
tranquil	1
Highland	1
voice.	1
"It	1
looked	1
so	1
unnecessary."	1
"You	1
must	1
be	1
ghastly	1
strong,"	1
said	1
Turnbull.	1
"One	1
is,	1
when	1
one	1
is	1
mad,"	1
was	1
the	1
careless	1
reply,	1
"and	1
it	1
had	1
worn	1
a	1
little	1
loose	1
in	1
the	1
socket.	1
Even	1
now	1
I've	1
got	1
it	1
out	1
I	1
can't	1
discover	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
for.	1
But	1
I've	1
found	1
out	1
something	1
a	1
long	1
sight	1
funnier."	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
mean?"	1
asked	1
Turnbull.	1
"I	1
have	1
found	1
out	1
where	1
A	1
is,"	1
said	1
the	1
other.	1
Three	1
weeks	1
afterwards	1
MacIan	1
had	1
managed	1
to	1
open	1
up	1
communications	1
which	1
made	1
his	1
meaning	1
plain.	1
By	1
that	1
time	1
the	1
two	1
captives	1
had	1
fully	1
discovered	1
and	1
demonstrated	1
that	1
weakness	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
nature	1
of	1
modern	1
machinery	1
to	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
already	1
referred.	1
The	1
very	1
fact	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
isolated	1
from	1
all	1
companions	1
meant	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
free	1
from	1
all	1
spies,	1
and	1
as	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
gaolers	1
to	1
be	1
bribed,	1
so	1
there	1
were	1
none	1
to	1
be	1
baffled.	1
Machinery	1
brought	1
them	1
their	1
cocoa	1
and	1
cleaned	1
their	1
cells;	1
that	1
machinery	1
was	1
as	1
helpless	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
pitiless.	1
A	1
little	1
patient	1
violence,	1
conducted	1
day	1
after	1
day	1
amid	1
constant	1
mutual	1
suggestion,	1
opened	1
an	1
irregular	1
hole	1
in	1
the	1
wall,	1
large	1
enough	1
to	1
let	1
in	1
a	1
small	1
man,	1
in	1
the	1
exact	1
place	1
where	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
before	1
the	1
tiny	1
ventilation	1
holes.	1
Turnbull	1
tumbled	1
somehow	1
into	1
MacIan's	1
apartment,	1
and	1
his	1
first	1
glance	1
found	1
out	1
that	1
the	1
iron	1
spike	1
was	1
indeed	1
plucked	1
from	1
its	1
socket,	1
and	1
left,	1
moreover,	1
another	1
ragged	1
hole	1
into	1
some	1
hollow	1
place	1
behind.	1
But	1
for	1
this	1
MacIan's	1
cell	1
was	1
the	1
duplicate	1
of	1
Turnbull's--a	1
long	1
oblong	1
ending	1
in	1
a	1
wedge	1
and	1
lined	1
with	1
cold	1
and	1
lustrous	1
tiles.	1
The	1
small	1
hole	1
from	1
which	1
the	1
peg	1
had	1
been	1
displaced	1
was	1
in	1
that	1
short	1
oblique	1
wall	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
nearest	1
to	1
Turnbull's.	1
That	1
individual	1
looked	1
at	1
it	1
with	1
a	1
puzzled	1
face.	1
"What	1
is	1
in	1
there?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
MacIan	1
answered	1
briefly:	1
"Another	1
cell."	1
"But	1
where	1
can	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
it	1
be?"	1
said	1
his	1
companion,	1
even	1
more	1
puzzled;	1
"the	1
doors	1
of	1
our	1
cells	1
are	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
end."	1
"It	1
has	1
no	1
door,"	1
said	1
Evan.	1
In	1
the	1
pause	1
of	1
perplexity	1
that	1
followed,	1
an	1
eerie	1
and	1
sinister	1
feeling	1
crept	1
over	1
Turnbull's	1
stubborn	1
soul	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
himself.	1
The	1
notion	1
of	1
the	1
doorless	1
room	1
chilled	1
him	1
with	1
that	1
sense	1
of	1
half-witted	1
curiosity	1
which	1
one	1
has	1
when	1
something	1
horrible	1
is	1
half	1
understood.	1
"James	1
Turnbull,"	1
said	1
MacIan,	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
and	1
shaken	1
voice,	1
"these	1
people	1
hate	1
us	1
more	1
than	1
Nero	1
hated	1
Christians,	1
and	1
fear	1
us	1
more	1
than	1
any	1
man	1
feared	1
Nero.	1
They	1
have	1
filled	1
England	1
with	1
frenzy	1
and	1
galloping	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
capture	1
us	1
and	1
wipe	1
us	1
out--in	1
order	1
to	1
kill	1
us.	1
And	1
they	1
have	1
killed	1
us,	1
for	1
you	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
only	1
made	1
a	1
hole	1
in	1
our	1
coffins.	1
But	1
though	1
this	1
hatred	1
that	1
they	1
felt	1
for	1
us	1
is	1
bigger	1
than	1
they	1
felt	1
for	1
Bonaparte,	1
and	1
more	1
plain	1
and	1
practical	1
than	1
they	1
would	1
feel	1
for	1
Jack	1
the	1
Ripper,	1
yet	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
we	1
whom	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
this	1
place	1
hate	1
most."	1
A	1
cold	1
and	1
quivering	1
impatience	1
continued	1
to	1
crawl	1
up	1
Turnbull's	1
spine;	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
felt	1
so	1
near	1
to	1
superstition	1
and	1
supernaturalism,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
pretty	1
sort	1
of	1
superstition	1
either.	1
"There	1
is	1
another	1
man	1
more	1
fearful	1
and	1
hateful,"	1
went	1
on	1
MacIan,	1
in	1
his	1
low	1
monotone	1
voice,	1
"and	1
they	1
have	1
buried	1
him	1
even	1
deeper.	1
God	1
knows	1
how	1
they	1
did	1
it,	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
let	1
in	1
by	1
neither	1
door	1
nor	1
window,	1
nor	1
lowered	1
through	1
any	1
opening	1
above.	1
I	1
expect	1
these	1
iron	1
handles	1
that	1
we	1
both	1
hate	1
have	1
been	1
part	1
of	1
some	1
damned	1
machinery	1
for	1
walling	1
him	1
up.	1
He	1
is	1
there.	1
I	1
have	1
looked	1
through	1
the	1
hole	1
at	1
him;	1
but	1
I	1
cannot	1
stand	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
long,	1
because	1
his	1
face	1
is	1
turned	1
away	1
from	1
me	1
and	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
move."	1
Al	1
Turnbull's	1
unnatural	1
and	1
uncompleted	1
feelings	1
found	1
their	1
outlet	1
in	1
rushing	1
to	1
the	1
aperture	1
and	1
looking	1
into	1
the	1
unknown	1
room.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
third	1
oblong	1
cell	1
exactly	1
like	1
the	1
other	1
two	1
except	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
doorless,	1
and	1
except	1
that	1
on	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
walls	1
was	1
painted	1
a	1
large	1
black	1
A	1
like	1
the	1
B	1
and	1
C	1
outside	1
their	1
own	1
doors.	1
The	1
letter	1
in	1
this	1
case	1
was	1
not	1
painted	1
outside,	1
because	1
this	1
prison	1
had	1
no	1
outside.	1
On	1
the	1
same	1
kind	1
of	1
tiled	1
floor,	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
monotonous	1
squares	1
had	1
maddened	1
Turnbull's	1
eye	1
and	1
brain,	1
was	1
sitting	1
a	1
figure	1
which	1
was	1
startlingly	1
short	1
even	1
for	1
a	1
child,	1
only	1
that	1
the	1
enormous	1
head	1
was	1
ringed	1
with	1
hair	1
of	1
a	1
frosty	1
grey.	1
The	1
figure	1
was	1
draped,	1
both	1
insecurely	1
and	1
insufficiently,	1
in	1
what	1
looked	1
like	1
the	1
remains	1
of	1
a	1
brown	1
flannel	1
dressing-gown;	1
an	1
emptied	1
cup	1
of	1
cocoa	1
stood	1
on	1
the	1
floor	1
beside	1
it,	1
and	1
the	1
creature	1
had	1
his	1
big	1
grey	1
head	1
cocked	1
at	1
a	1
particular	1
angle	1
of	1
inquiry	1
or	1
attention	1
which	1
amid	1
all	1
that	1
gathering	1
gloom	1
and	1
mystery	1
struck	1
one	1
as	1
comic	1
if	1
not	1
cocksure.	1
After	1
six	1
still	1
seconds	1
Turnbull	1
could	1
stand	1
it	1
no	1
longer,	1
but	1
called	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
dwarfish	1
thing--in	1
what	1
words	1
heaven	1
knows.	1
The	1
thing	1
got	1
up	1
with	1
the	1
promptitude	1
of	1
an	1
animal,	1
and	1
turning	1
round	1
offered	1
the	1
spectacle	1
of	1
two	1
owlish	1
eyes	1
and	1
a	1
huge	1
grey-and-white	1
beard	1
not	1
unlike	1
the	1
plumage	1
of	1
an	1
owl.	1
This	1
extraordinary	1
beard	1
covered	1
him	1
literally	1
to	1
his	1
feet	1
(not	1
that	1
that	1
was	1
very	1
far),	1
and	1
perhaps	1
it	1
was	1
as	1
well	1
that	1
it	1
did,	1
for	1
portions	1
of	1
his	1
remaining	1
clothing	1
seemed	1
to	1
fall	1
off	1
whenever	1
he	1
moved.	1
One	1
talks	1
trivially	1
of	1
a	1
face	1
like	1
parchment,	1
but	1
this	1
old	1
man's	1
face	1
was	1
so	1
wrinkled	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
like	1
a	1
parchment	1
loaded	1
with	1
hieroglyphics.	1
The	1
lines	1
of	1
his	1
face	1
were	1
so	1
deep	1
and	1
complex	1
that	1
one	1
could	1
see	1
five	1
or	1
ten	1
different	1
faces	1
besides	1
the	1
real	1
one,	1
as	1
one	1
can	1
see	1
them	1
in	1
an	1
elaborate	1
wall-paper.	1
And	1
yet	1
while	1
his	1
face	1
seemed	1
like	1
a	1
scripture	1
older	1
than	1
the	1
gods,	1
his	1
eyes	1
were	1
quite	1
bright,	1
blue,	1
and	1
startled	1
like	1
those	1
of	1
a	1
baby.	1
They	1
looked	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
only	1
an	1
instant	1
before	1
been	1
fitted	1
into	1
his	1
head.	1
Everything	1
depended	1
so	1
obviously	1
upon	1
whether	1
this	1
buried	1
monster	1
spoke	1
that	1
Turnbull	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
or	1
care	1
whether	1
he	1
himself	1
had	1
spoken.	1
He	1
said	1
something	1
or	1
nothing.	1
And	1
then	1
he	1
waited	1
for	1
this	1
dwarfish	1
voice	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
hidden	1
under	1
the	1
mountains	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
At	1
last	1
it	1
did	1
speak,	1
and	1
spoke	1
in	1
English,	1
with	1
a	1
foreign	1
accent	1
that	1
was	1
neither	1
Latin	1
nor	1
Teutonic.	1
He	1
suddenly	1
stretched	1
out	1
a	1
long	1
and	1
very	1
dirty	1
forefinger,	1
and	1
cried	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
of	1
clear	1
recognition,	1
like	1
a	1
child's:	1
"That's	1
a	1
hole."	1
He	1
digested	1
the	1
discovery	1
for	1
some	1
seconds,	1
sucking	1
his	1
finger,	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
cried,	1
with	1
a	1
crow	1
of	1
laughter:	1
"And	1
that's	1
a	1
head	1
come	1
through	1
it."	1
The	1
hilarious	1
energy	1
in	1
this	1
idiot	1
attitude	1
gave	1
Turnbull	1
another	1
sick	1
turn.	1
He	1
had	1
grown	1
to	1
tolerate	1
those	1
dreary	1
and	1
mumbling	1
madmen	1
who	1
trailed	1
themselves	1
about	1
the	1
beautiful	1
asylum	1
gardens.	1
But	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
new	1
and	1
subversive	1
of	1
the	1
universe	1
in	1
the	1
combination	1
of	1
so	1
much	1
cheerful	1
decision	1
with	1
a	1
body	1
without	1
a	1
brain.	1
"Why	1
did	1
they	1
put	1
you	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
place?"	1
he	1
asked	1
at	1
last	1
with	1
embarrassment.	1
"Good	1
place.	1
Yes,"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
man,	1
nodding	1
a	1
great	1
many	1
times	1
and	1
beaming	1
like	1
a	1
flattered	1
landlord.	1
"Good	1
shape.	1
Long	1
and	1
narrow,	1
with	1
a	1
point.	1
Like	1
this,"	1
and	1
he	1
made	1
lovingly	1
with	1
his	1
hands	1
a	1
map	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
in	1
the	1
air.	1
"But	1
that's	1
not	1
the	1
best,"	1
he	1
added,	1
confidentially.	1
"Squares	1
very	1
good;	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
nice	1
long	1
holiday,	1
and	1
can	1
count	1
them.	1
But	1
that's	1
not	1
the	1
best."	1
"What	1
is	1
the	1
best?"	1
asked	1
Turnbull	1
in	1
great	1
distress.	1
"Spike	1
is	1
the	1
best,"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
man,	1
opening	1
his	1
blue	1
eyes	1
blazing;	1
"it	1
sticks	1
out."	1
The	1
words	1
Turnbull	1
spoke	1
broke	1
out	1
of	1
him	1
in	1
pure	1
pity.	1
"Can't	1
we	1
do	1
anything	1
for	1
you?"	1
he	1
said.	1
"I	1
am	1
very	1
happy,"	1
said	1
the	1
other,	1
alphabetically.	1
"You	1
are	1
a	1
good	1
man.	1
Can	1
I	1
help	1
you?"	1
"No,	1
I	1
don't	1
think	1
you	1
can,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
Turnbull	1
with	1
rough	1
pathos;	1
"I	1
am	1
glad	1
you	1
are	1
contented	1
at	1
least."	1
The	1
weird	1
old	1
person	1
opened	1
his	1
broad	1
blue	1
eyes	1
and	1
fixed	1
Turnbull	1
with	1
a	1
stare	1
extraordinarily	1
severe.	1
"You	1
are	1
quite	1
sure,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"I	1
cannot	1
help	1
you?"	1
"Quite	1
sure,	1
thank	1
you,"	1
said	1
Turnbull	1
with	1
broken	1
brevity.	1
"Good	1
day."	1
Then	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
MacIan	1
who	1
was	1
standing	1
close	1
behind	1
him,	1
and	1
whose	1
face,	1
now	1
familiar	1
in	1
all	1
its	1
moods,	1
told	1
him	1
easily	1
that	1
Evan	1
had	1
heard	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
the	1
strange	1
dialogue.	1
"Curse	1
those	1
cruel	1
beasts!"	1
cried	1
Turnbull.	1
"They've	1
turned	1
him	1
to	1
an	1
imbecile	1
just	1
by	1
burying	1
him	1
alive.	1
His	1
brain's	1
like	1
a	1
pin-point	1
now."	1
"You	1
are	1
sure	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
lunatic?"	1
said	1
Evan,	1
slowly.	1
"Not	1
a	1
lunatic,"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
"an	1
idiot.	1
He	1
just	1
points	1
to	1
things	1
and	1
says	1
that	1
they	1
stick	1
out."	1
"He	1
had	1
a	1
notion	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
help	1
us,"	1
said	1
MacIan	1
moodily,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
pace	1
towards	1
the	1
other	1
end	1
of	1
his	1
cell.	1
"Yes,	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
bit	1
pathetic,"	1
assented	1
Turnbull;	1
"such	1
a	1
Thing	1
offering	1
help,	1
and	1
besides----	1
Hallo!	1
Hallo!	1
What's	1
the	1
matter?"	1
"God	1
Almighty	1
guide	1
us	1
all!"	1
said	1
MacIan.	1
He	1
was	1
standing	1
heavy	1
and	1
still	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
staring	1
quietly	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
which	1
for	1
thirty	1
days	1
had	1
sealed	1
them	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
sun.	1
Turnbull,	1
following	1
the	1
other's	1
eye,	1
stared	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
likewise,	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
also	1
uttered	1
an	1
exclamation.	1
The	1
iron	1
door	1
was	1
standing	1
about	1
an	1
inch	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
open.	1
"He	1
said----"	1
began	1
Evan,	1
in	1
a	1
trembling	1
voice--"he	1
offered----"	1
"Come	1
along,	1
you	1
fool!"	1
shouted	1
Turnbull	1
with	1
a	1
sudden	1
and	1
furious	1
energy.	1
"I	1
see	1
it	1
all	1
now,	1
and	1
it's	1
the	1
best	1
stroke	1
of	1
luck	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
You	1
pulled	1
out	1
that	1
iron	1
handle	1
that	1
had	1
screwed	1
up	1
his	1
cell,	1
and	1
it	1
somehow	1
altered	1
the	1
machinery	1
and	1
opened	1
all	1
the	1
doors."	1
Seizing	1
MacIan	1
by	1
the	1
elbow	1
he	1
bundled	1
him	1
bodily	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
open	1
corridor	1
and	1
ran	1
him	1
on	1
till	1
they	1
saw	1
daylight	1
through	1
a	1
half-darkened	1
window.	1
"All	1
the	1
same,"	1
said	1
Evan,	1
like	1
one	1
answering	1
in	1
an	1
ordinary	1
conversation,	1
"he	1
did	1
ask	1
you	1
whether	1
he	1
could	1
help	1
you."	1
All	1
this	1
wilderness	1
of	1
windowless	1
passages	1
was	1
so	1
built	1
into	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
that	1
fortress	1
of	1
fear	1
that	1
it	1
seemed	1
more	1
than	1
an	1
hour	1
before	1
the	1
fugitives	1
had	1
any	1
good	1
glimpse	1
of	1
the	1
outer	1
world.	1
They	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
know	1
what	1
hour	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
it	1
was;	1
and	1
when,	1
turning	1
a	1
corner,	1
they	1
saw	1
the	1
bare	1
tunnel	1
of	1
the	1
corridor	1
end	1
abruptly	1
in	1
a	1
shining	1
square	1
of	1
garden,	1
the	1
grass	1
burning	1
in	1
that	1
strong	1
evening	1
sunshine	1
which	1
makes	1
it	1
burnished	1
gold	1
rather	1
than	1
green,	1
the	1
abrupt	1
opening	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
earth	1
seemed	1
like	1
a	1
hole	1
knocked	1
in	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
heaven.	1
Only	1
once	1
or	1
twice	1
in	1
life	1
is	1
it	1
permitted	1
to	1
a	1
man	1
thus	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
very	1
universe	1
from	1
outside,	1
and	1
feel	1
existence	1
itself	1
as	1
an	1
adorable	1
adventure	1
not	1
yet	1
begun.	1
As	1
they	1
found	1
this	1
shining	1
escape	1
out	1
of	1
that	1
hellish	1
labyrinth	1
they	1
both	1
had	1
simultaneously	1
the	1
sensation	1
of	1
being	1
babes	1
unborn,	1
of	1
being	1
asked	1
by	1
God	1
if	1
they	1
would	1
like	1
to	1
live	1
upon	1
the	1
earth.	1
They	1
were	1
looking	1
in	1
at	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
seven	1
gates	1
of	1
Eden.	1
Turnbull	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
leap	1
into	1
the	1
garden,	1
with	1
an	1
earth-spurning	1
leap	1
like	1
that	1
of	1
one	1
who	1
could	1
really	1
spread	1
his	1
wings	1
and	1
fly.	1
MacIan,	1
who	1
came	1
an	1
instant	1
after,	1
was	1
less	1
full	1
of	1
mere	1
animal	1
gusto	1
and	1
fuller	1
of	1
a	1
more	1
fearful	1
and	1
quivering	1
pleasure	1
in	1
the	1
clear	1
and	1
innocent	1
flower	1
colours	1
and	1
the	1
high	1
and	1
holy	1
trees.	1
With	1
one	1
bound	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
that	1
cool	1
and	1
cleared	1
landscape,	1
and	1
they	1
found	1
just	1
outside	1
the	1
door	1
the	1
black-clad	1
gentleman	1
with	1
the	1
cloven	1
chin	1
smilingly	1
regarding	1
them;	1
and	1
his	1
chin	1
seemed	1
to	1
grow	1
longer	1
and	1
longer	1
as	1
he	1
smiled.	1
XVIII.	1
A	1
RIDDLE	1
OF	1
FACES	1
Just	1
behind	1
him	1
stood	1
two	1
other	1
doctors:	1
one,	1
the	1
familiar	1
Dr.	1
Quayle,	1
of	1
the	1
blinking	1
eyes	1
and	1
bleating	1
voice;	1
the	1
other,	1
a	1
more	1
commonplace	1
but	1
much	1
more	1
forcible	1
figure,	1
a	1
stout	1
young	1
doctor	1
with	1
short,	1
well-brushed	1
hair	1
and	1
a	1
round	1
but	1
resolute	1
face.	1
At	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
escape	1
these	1
two	1
subordinates	1
uttered	1
a	1
cry	1
and	1
sprang	1
forward,	1
but	1
their	1
superior	1
remained	1
motionless	1
and	1
smiling,	1
and	1
somehow	1
the	1
lack	1
of	1
his	1
support	1
seemed	1
to	1
arrest	1
and	1
freeze	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
gesture	1
of	1
pursuit.	1
"Let	1
them	1
be,"	1
he	1
cried	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
that	1
cut	1
like	1
a	1
blade	1
of	1
ice;	1
and	1
not	1
only	1
of	1
ice,	1
but	1
of	1
some	1
awful	1
primordial	1
ice	1
that	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
water.	1
"I	1
want	1
no	1
devoted	1
champions,"	1
said	1
the	1
cutting	1
voice;	1
"even	1
the	1
folly	1
of	1
one's	1
friends	1
bores	1
one	1
at	1
last.	1
You	1
don't	1
suppose	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
let	1
these	1
lunatics	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
cells	1
without	1
good	1
reason.	1
I	1
have	1
the	1
best	1
and	1
fullest	1
reason.	1
They	1
can	1
be	1
let	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
cell	1
today,	1
because	1
today	1
the	1
whole	1
world	1
has	1
become	1
their	1
cell.	1
I	1
will	1
have	1
no	1
more	1
medieval	1
mummery	1
of	1
chains	1
and	1
doors.	1
Let	1
them	1
wander	1
about	1
the	1
earth	1
as	1
they	1
wandered	1
about	1
this	1
garden,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
still	1
be	1
their	1
easy	1
master.	1
Let	1
them	1
take	1
the	1
wings	1
of	1
the	1
morning	1
and	1
abide	1
in	1
the	1
uttermost	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
sea--I	1
am	1
there.	1
Whither	1
shall	1
they	1
go	1
from	1
my	1
presence	1
and	1
whither	1
shall	1
they	1
flee	1
from	1
my	1
spirit?	1
Courage,	1
Dr.	1
Quayle,	1
and	1
do	1
not	1
be	1
downhearted;	1
the	1
real	1
days	1
of	1
tyranny	1
are	1
only	1
beginning	1
on	1
this	1
earth."	1
And	1
with	1
that	1
the	1
Master	1
laughed	1
and	1
swung	1
away	1
from	1
them,	1
almost	1
as	1
if	1
his	1
laugh	1
was	1
a	1
bad	1
thing	1
for	1
people	1
to	1
see.	1
"Might	1
I	1
speak	1
to	1
you	1
a	1
moment?"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
stepping	1
forward	1
with	1
a	1
respectful	1
resolution.	1
But	1
the	1
shoulders	1
of	1
the	1
Master	1
only	1
seemed	1
to	1
take	1
on	1
a	1
new	1
and	1
unexpected	1
angle	1
of	1
mockery	1
as	1
he	1
strode	1
away.	1
Turnbull	1
swung	1
round	1
with	1
great	1
abruptness	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
two	1
doctors,	1
and	1
said,	1
harshly:	1
"What	1
in	1
snakes	1
does	1
he	1
mean--and	1
who	1
are	1
you?"	1
"My	1
name	1
is	1
Hutton,"	1
said	1
the	1
short,	1
stout	1
man,	1
"and	1
I	1
am--well,	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
whose	1
business	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
uphold	1
this	1
establishment."	1
"My	1
name	1
is	1
Turnbull,"	1
said	1
the	1
other;	1
"I	1
am	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
whose	1
business	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
tear	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
ground."	1
The	1
small	1
doctor	1
smiled,	1
and	1
Turnbull's	1
anger	1
seemed	1
suddenly	1
to	1
steady	1
him.	1
"But	1
I	1
don't	1
want	1
to	1
talk	1
about	1
that,"	1
he	1
said,	1
calmly;	1
"I	1
only	1
want	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
the	1
Master	1
of	1
this	1
asylum	1
really	1
means."	1
Dr.	1
Hutton's	1
smile	1
broke	1
into	1
a	1
laugh	1
which,	1
short	1
as	1
it	1
was,	1
had	1
the	1
suspicion	1
of	1
a	1
shake	1
in	1
it.	1
"I	1
suppose	1
you	1
think	1
that	1
quite	1
a	1
simple	1
question,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"I	1
think	1
it	1
a	1
plain	1
question,"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
"and	1
one	1
that	1
deserves	1
a	1
plain	1
answer.	1
Why	1
did	1
the	1
Master	1
lock	1
us	1
up	1
in	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
cupboards	1
like	1
jars	1
of	1
pickles	1
for	1
a	1
mortal	1
month,	1
and	1
why	1
does	1
he	1
now	1
let	1
us	1
walk	1
free	1
in	1
the	1
garden	1
again?"	1
"I	1
understand,"	1
said	1
Hutton,	1
with	1
arched	1
eyebrows,	1
"that	1
your	1
complaint	1
is	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
now	1
free	1
to	1
walk	1
in	1
the	1
garden."	1
"My	1
complaint	1
is,"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
stubbornly,	1
"that	1
if	1
I	1
am	1
fit	1
to	1
walk	1
freely	1
now,	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
as	1
fit	1
for	1
the	1
last	1
month.	1
No	1
one	1
has	1
examined	1
me,	1
no	1
one	1
has	1
come	1
near	1
me.	1
Your	1
chief	1
says	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
only	1
free	1
because	1
he	1
has	1
made	1
other	1
arrangements.	1
What	1
are	1
those	1
arrangements?"	1
The	1
young	1
man	1
with	1
the	1
round	1
face	1
looked	1
down	1
for	1
a	1
little	1
while	1
and	1
smoked	1
reflectively.	1
The	1
other	1
and	1
elder	1
doctor	1
had	1
gone	1
pacing	1
nervously	1
by	1
himself	1
upon	1
the	1
lawn.	1
At	1
length	1
the	1
round	1
face	1
was	1
lifted	1
again,	1
and	1
showed	1
two	1
round	1
blue	1
eyes	1
with	1
a	1
certain	1
frankness	1
in	1
them.	1
"Well,	1
I	1
don't	1
see	1
that	1
it	1
can	1
do	1
any	1
harm	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
know,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"You	1
were	1
shut	1
up	1
just	1
then	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
just	1
during	1
that	1
month	1
that	1
the	1
Master	1
was	1
bringing	1
off	1
his	1
big	1
scheme.	1
He	1
was	1
getting	1
his	1
bill	1
through	1
Parliament,	1
and	1
organizing	1
the	1
new	1
medical	1
police.	1
But	1
of	1
course	1
you	1
haven't	1
heard	1
of	1
all	1
that;	1
in	1
fact,	1
you	1
weren't	1
meant	1
to."	1
"Heard	1
of	1
all	1
what?"	1
asked	1
the	1
impatient	1
inquirer.	1
"There's	1
a	1
new	1
law	1
now,	1
and	1
the	1
asylum	1
powers	1
are	1
greatly	1
extended.	1
Even	1
if	1
you	1
did	1
escape	1
now,	1
any	1
policeman	1
would	1
take	1
you	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
next	1
town	1
if	1
you	1
couldn't	1
show	1
a	1
certificate	1
of	1
sanity	1
from	1
us."	1
"Well,"	1
continued	1
Dr.	1
Hutton,	1
"the	1
Master	1
described	1
before	1
both	1
Houses	1
of	1
Parliament	1
the	1
real	1
scientific	1
objection	1
to	1
all	1
existing	1
legislation	1
about	1
lunacy.	1
As	1
he	1
very	1
truly	1
said,	1
the	1
mistake	1
was	1
in	1
supposing	1
insanity	1
to	1
be	1
merely	1
an	1
exception	1
or	1
an	1
extreme.	1
Insanity,	1
like	1
forgetfulness,	1
is	1
simply	1
a	1
quality	1
which	1
enters	1
more	1
or	1
less	1
into	1
all	1
human	1
beings;	1
and	1
for	1
practical	1
purposes	1
it	1
is	1
more	1
necessary	1
to	1
know	1
whose	1
mind	1
is	1
really	1
trustworthy	1
than	1
whose	1
has	1
some	1
accidental	1
taint.	1
We	1
have	1
therefore	1
reversed	1
the	1
existing	1
method,	1
and	1
people	1
now	1
have	1
to	1
prove	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
sane.	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
village	1
you	1
entered,	1
the	1
village	1
constable	1
would	1
notice	1
that	1
you	1
were	1
not	1
wearing	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
lapel	1
of	1
your	1
coat	1
the	1
small	1
pewter	1
S	1
which	1
is	1
now	1
necessary	1
to	1
any	1
one	1
who	1
walks	1
about	1
beyond	1
asylum	1
bounds	1
or	1
outside	1
asylum	1
hours."	1
"You	1
mean	1
to	1
say,"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
"that	1
this	1
was	1
what	1
the	1
Master	1
of	1
the	1
asylum	1
urged	1
before	1
the	1
House	1
of	1
Commons?"	1
Dr.	1
Hutton	1
nodded	1
with	1
gravity.	1
"And	1
you	1
mean	1
to	1
say,"	1
cried	1
Turnbull,	1
with	1
a	1
vibrant	1
snort,	1
"that	1
that	1
proposal	1
was	1
passed	1
in	1
an	1
assembly	1
that	1
calls	1
itself	1
democratic?"	1
The	1
doctor	1
showed	1
his	1
whole	1
row	1
of	1
teeth	1
in	1
a	1
smile.	1
"Oh,	1
the	1
assembly	1
calls	1
itself	1
Socialist	1
now,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"But	1
we	1
explained	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
a	1
question	1
for	1
men	1
of	1
science."	1
Turnbull	1
gave	1
one	1
stamp	1
upon	1
the	1
gravel,	1
then	1
pulled	1
himself	1
together,	1
and	1
resumed:	1
"But	1
why	1
should	1
your	1
infernal	1
head	1
medicine-man	1
lock	1
us	1
up	1
in	1
separate	1
cells	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
turning	1
England	1
into	1
a	1
madhouse?	1
I'm	1
not	1
the	1
Prime	1
Minister;	1
we're	1
not	1
the	1
House	1
of	1
Lords."	1
"He	1
wasn't	1
afraid	1
of	1
the	1
Prime	1
Minister,"	1
replied	1
Dr.	1
Hutton;	1
"he	1
isn't	1
afraid	1
of	1
the	1
House	1
of	1
Lords.	1
But----"	1
"Well?"	1
inquired	1
Turnbull,	1
stamping	1
again.	1
"He	1
is	1
afraid	1
of	1
you,"	1
said	1
Hutton,	1
simply.	1
"Why,	1
didn't	1
you	1
know?"	1
MacIan,	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
spoken	1
yet,	1
made	1
one	1
stride	1
forward	1
and	1
stood	1
with	1
shaking	1
limbs	1
and	1
shining	1
eyes.	1
"He	1
was	1
afraid!"	1
began	1
Evan,	1
thickly.	1
"You	1
mean	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
we----"	1
"I	1
mean	1
to	1
say	1
the	1
plain	1
truth	1
now	1
that	1
the	1
danger	1
is	1
over,"	1
said	1
Hutton,	1
calmly;	1
"most	1
certainly	1
you	1
two	1
were	1
the	1
only	1
people	1
he	1
ever	1
was	1
afraid	1
of."	1
Then	1
he	1
added	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
but	1
not	1
inaudible	1
voice:	1
"Except	1
one--whom	1
he	1
feared	1
worse,	1
and	1
has	1
buried	1
deeper."	1
"Come	1
away,"	1
cried	1
MacIan,	1
"this	1
has	1
to	1
be	1
thought	1
about."	1
Turnbull	1
followed	1
him	1
in	1
silence	1
as	1
he	1
strode	1
away,	1
but	1
just	1
before	1
he	1
vanished,	1
turned	1
and	1
spoke	1
again	1
to	1
the	1
doctors.	1
"But	1
what	1
has	1
got	1
hold	1
of	1
people?"	1
he	1
asked,	1
abruptly.	1
"Why	1
should	1
all	1
England	1
have	1
gone	1
dotty	1
on	1
the	1
mere	1
subject	1
of	1
dottiness?"	1
Dr.	1
Hutton	1
smiled	1
his	1
open	1
smile	1
once	1
more	1
and	1
bowed	1
slightly.	1
"As	1
to	1
that	1
also,"	1
he	1
replied,	1
"I	1
don't	1
want	1
to	1
make	1
you	1
vain."	1
Turnbull	1
swung	1
round	1
without	1
a	1
word,	1
and	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
companion	1
were	1
lost	1
in	1
the	1
lustrous	1
leafage	1
of	1
the	1
garden.	1
They	1
noticed	1
nothing	1
special	1
about	1
the	1
scene,	1
except	1
that	1
the	1
garden	1
seemed	1
more	1
exquisite	1
than	1
ever	1
in	1
the	1
deepening	1
sunset,	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
many	1
more	1
people,	1
whether	1
patients	1
or	1
attendants,	1
walking	1
about	1
in	1
it.	1
From	1
behind	1
the	1
two	1
black-coated	1
doctors	1
as	1
they	1
stood	1
on	1
the	1
lawn	1
another	1
figure	1
somewhat	1
similarly	1
dressed	1
strode	1
hurriedly	1
past	1
them,	1
having	1
also	1
grizzled	1
hair	1
and	1
an	1
open	1
flapping	1
frock-coat.	1
Both	1
his	1
decisive	1
step	1
and	1
dapper	1
black	1
array	1
marked	1
him	1
out	1
as	1
another	1
medical	1
man,	1
or	1
at	1
least	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
authority,	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
passed	1
Turnbull	1
the	1
latter	1
was	1
aroused	1
by	1
a	1
strong	1
impression	1
of	1
having	1
seen	1
the	1
man	1
somewhere	1
before.	1
It	1
was	1
no	1
one	1
that	1
he	1
knew	1
well,	1
yet	1
he	1
was	1
certain	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
someone	1
at	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
at	1
sometime	1
or	1
other	1
looked	1
steadily.	1
It	1
was	1
neither	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
a	1
friend	1
nor	1
of	1
an	1
enemy;	1
it	1
aroused	1
neither	1
irritation	1
nor	1
tenderness,	1
yet	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
face	1
which	1
had	1
for	1
some	1
reason	1
been	1
of	1
great	1
importance	1
in	1
his	1
life.	1
Turning	1
and	1
returning,	1
and	1
making	1
detours	1
about	1
the	1
garden,	1
he	1
managed	1
to	1
study	1
the	1
man's	1
face	1
again	1
and	1
again--a	1
moustached,	1
somewhat	1
military	1
face	1
with	1
a	1
monocle,	1
the	1
sort	1
of	1
face	1
that	1
is	1
aristocratic	1
without	1
being	1
distinguished.	1
Turnbull	1
could	1
not	1
remember	1
any	1
particular	1
doctors	1
in	1
his	1
decidedly	1
healthy	1
existence.	1
Was	1
the	1
man	1
a	1
long-lost	1
uncle,	1
or	1
was	1
he	1
only	1
somebody	1
who	1
had	1
sat	1
opposite	1
him	1
regularly	1
in	1
a	1
railway	1
train?	1
At	1
that	1
moment	1
the	1
man	1
knocked	1
down	1
his	1
own	1
eye-glass	1
with	1
a	1
gesture	1
of	1
annoyance;	1
Turnbull	1
remembered	1
the	1
gesture,	1
and	1
the	1
truth	1
sprang	1
up	1
solid	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
him.	1
The	1
man	1
with	1
the	1
moustaches	1
was	1
Cumberland	1
Vane,	1
the	1
London	1
police	1
magistrate	1
before	1
whom	1
he	1
and	1
MacIan	1
had	1
once	1
stood	1
on	1
their	1
trial.	1
The	1
magistrate	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
transferred	1
to	1
some	1
other	1
official	1
duties--to	1
something	1
connected	1
with	1
the	1
inspection	1
of	1
asylums.	1
Turnbull's	1
heart	1
gave	1
a	1
leap	1
of	1
excitement	1
which	1
was	1
half	1
hope.	1
As	1
a	1
magistrate	1
Mr.	1
Cumberland	1
Vane	1
had	1
been	1
somewhat	1
careless	1
and	1
shallow,	1
but	1
certainly	1
kindly,	1
and	1
not	1
inaccessible	1
to	1
common	1
sense	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
put	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
strictly	1
conventional	1
language.	1
He	1
was	1
at	1
least	1
an	1
authority	1
of	1
a	1
more	1
human	1
and	1
refreshing	1
sort	1
than	1
the	1
crank	1
with	1
the	1
wagging	1
beard	1
or	1
the	1
fiend	1
with	1
the	1
forked	1
chin.	1
He	1
went	1
straight	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
magistrate,	1
and	1
said:	1
"Good	1
evening,	1
Mr.	1
Vane;	1
I	1
doubt	1
if	1
you	1
remember	1
me."	1
Cumberland	1
Vane	1
screwed	1
the	1
eye-glass	1
into	1
his	1
scowling	1
face	1
for	1
an	1
instant,	1
and	1
then	1
said	1
curtly	1
but	1
not	1
uncivilly:	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
remember	1
you,	1
sir;	1
assault	1
or	1
battery,	1
wasn't	1
it?--a	1
fellow	1
broke	1
your	1
window.	1
A	1
tall	1
fellow--McSomething--case	1
made	1
rather	1
a	1
noise	1
afterwards."	1
"MacIan	1
is	1
the	1
name,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
respectfully;	1
"I	1
have	1
him	1
here	1
with	1
me."	1
"Eh!"	1
said	1
Vane	1
very	1
sharply.	1
"Confound	1
him!	1
Has	1
he	1
got	1
anything	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
this	1
game?"	1
"Mr.	1
Vane,"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
pacifically,	1
"I	1
will	1
not	1
pretend	1
that	1
either	1
he	1
or	1
I	1
acted	1
quite	1
decorously	1
on	1
that	1
occasion.	1
You	1
were	1
very	1
lenient	1
with	1
us,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
treat	1
us	1
as	1
criminals	1
when	1
you	1
very	1
well	1
might.	1
So	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
you	1
will	1
give	1
us	1
your	1
testimony	1
that,	1
even	1
if	1
we	1
were	1
criminals,	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
lunatics	1
in	1
any	1
legal	1
or	1
medical	1
sense	1
whatever.	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
you	1
will	1
use	1
your	1
influence	1
for	1
us."	1
"My	1
influence!"	1
repeated	1
the	1
magistrate,	1
with	1
a	1
slight	1
start.	1
"I	1
don't	1
quite	1
understand	1
you."	1
"I	1
don't	1
know	1
in	1
what	1
capacity	1
you	1
are	1
here,"	1
continued	1
Turnbull,	1
gravely,	1
"but	1
a	1
legal	1
authority	1
of	1
your	1
distinction	1
must	1
certainly	1
be	1
here	1
in	1
an	1
important	1
one.	1
Whether	1
you	1
are	1
visiting	1
and	1
inspecting	1
the	1
place,	1
or	1
attached	1
to	1
it	1
as	1
some	1
kind	1
of	1
permanent	1
legal	1
adviser,	1
your	1
opinion	1
must	1
still----"	1
Cumberland	1
Vane	1
exploded	1
with	1
a	1
detonation	1
of	1
oaths;	1
his	1
face	1
was	1
transfigured	1
with	1
fury	1
and	1
contempt,	1
and	1
yet	1
in	1
some	1
odd	1
way	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
specially	1
angry	1
with	1
Turnbull.	1
"But	1
Lord	1
bless	1
us	1
and	1
save	1
us!"	1
he	1
gasped,	1
at	1
length;	1
"I'm	1
not	1
here	1
as	1
an	1
official	1
at	1
all.	1
I'm	1
here	1
as	1
a	1
patient.	1
The	1
cursed	1
pack	1
of	1
rat-catching	1
chemists	1
all	1
say	1
that	1
I've	1
lost	1
my	1
wits."	1
"You!"	1
cried	1
Turnbull	1
with	1
terrible	1
emphasis.	1
"You!	1
Lost	1
your	1
wits!"	1
In	1
the	1
rush	1
of	1
his	1
real	1
astonishment	1
at	1
this	1
towering	1
unreality	1
Turnbull	1
almost	1
added:	1
"Why,	1
you	1
haven't	1
got	1
any	1
to	1
lose."	1
But	1
he	1
fortunately	1
remembered	1
the	1
remains	1
of	1
his	1
desperate	1
diplomacy.	1
"This	1
can't	1
go	1
on,"	1
he	1
said,	1
positively.	1
"Men	1
like	1
MacIan	1
and	1
I	1
may	1
suffer	1
unjustly	1
all	1
our	1
lives,	1
but	1
a	1
man	1
like	1
you	1
must	1
have	1
influence."	1
"There	1
is	1
only	1
one	1
man	1
who	1
has	1
any	1
influence	1
in	1
England	1
now,"	1
said	1
Vane,	1
and	1
his	1
high	1
voice	1
fell	1
to	1
a	1
sudden	1
and	1
convincing	1
quietude.	1
"Whom	1
do	1
you	1
mean?"	1
asked	1
Turnbull.	1
"I	1
mean	1
that	1
cursed	1
fellow	1
with	1
the	1
long	1
split	1
chin,"	1
said	1
the	1
other.	1
"Is	1
it	1
really	1
true,"	1
asked	1
Turnbull,	1
"that	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
allowed	1
to	1
buy	1
up	1
and	1
control	1
such	1
a	1
lot?	1
What	1
put	1
the	1
country	1
into	1
such	1
a	1
state?"	1
Mr.	1
Cumberland	1
Vane	1
laughed	1
outright.	1
"What	1
put	1
the	1
country	1
into	1
such	1
a	1
state?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
"Why,	1
you	1
did.	1
When	1
you	1
were	1
fool	1
enough	1
to	1
agree	1
to	1
fight	1
MacIan,	1
after	1
all,	1
everybody	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
the	1
Bank	1
of	1
England	1
might	1
paint	1
itself	1
pink	1
with	1
white	1
spots."	1
"I	1
don't	1
understand,"	1
answered	1
Turnbull.	1
"Why	1
should	1
you	1
be	1
surprised	1
at	1
my	1
fighting?	1
I	1
hope	1
I	1
have	1
always	1
fought."	1
"Well,"	1
said	1
Cumberland	1
Vane,	1
airily,	1
"you	1
didn't	1
believe	1
in	1
religion,	1
you	1
see--so	1
we	1
thought	1
you	1
were	1
safe	1
at	1
any	1
rate.	1
You	1
went	1
further	1
in	1
your	1
language	1
than	1
most	1
of	1
us	1
wanted	1
to	1
go;	1
no	1
good	1
in	1
just	1
hurting	1
one's	1
mother's	1
feelings,	1
I	1
think.	1
But	1
of	1
course	1
we	1
all	1
knew	1
you	1
were	1
right,	1
and,	1
really,	1
we	1
relied	1
on	1
you."	1
"Did	1
you?"	1
said	1
the	1
editor	1
of	1
_The	1
Atheist_	1
with	1
a	1
bursting	1
heart.	1
"I	1
am	1
sorry	1
you	1
did	1
not	1
tell	1
me	1
so	1
at	1
the	1
time."	1
He	1
walked	1
away	1
very	1
rapidly	1
and	1
flung	1
himself	1
on	1
a	1
garden	1
seat,	1
and	1
for	1
some	1
six	1
minutes	1
his	1
own	1
wrongs	1
hid	1
from	1
him	1
the	1
huge	1
and	1
hilarious	1
fact	1
that	1
Cumberland	1
Vane	1
had	1
been	1
locked	1
up	1
as	1
a	1
lunatic.	1
The	1
garden	1
of	1
the	1
madhouse	1
was	1
so	1
perfectly	1
planned,	1
and	1
answered	1
so	1
exquisitely	1
to	1
every	1
hour	1
of	1
daylight,	1
that	1
one	1
could	1
almost	1
fancy	1
that	1
the	1
sunlight	1
was	1
caught	1
there	1
tangled	1
in	1
its	1
tinted	1
trees,	1
as	1
the	1
wise	1
men	1
of	1
Gotham	1
tried	1
to	1
chain	1
the	1
spring	1
to	1
a	1
bush.	1
Or	1
it	1
seemed	1
as	1
if	1
this	1
ironic	1
paradise	1
still	1
kept	1
its	1
unique	1
dawn	1
or	1
its	1
special	1
sunset	1
while	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
earthly	1
globe	1
rolled	1
through	1
its	1
ordinary	1
hours.	1
There	1
was	1
one	1
evening,	1
or	1
late	1
afternoon,	1
in	1
particular,	1
which	1
Evan	1
MacIan	1
will	1
remember	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
moments	1
of	1
death.	1
It	1
was	1
what	1
artists	1
call	1
a	1
daffodil	1
sky,	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
coarsened	1
even	1
by	1
reference	1
to	1
a	1
daffodil.	1
It	1
was	1
of	1
that	1
innocent	1
lonely	1
yellow	1
which	1
has	1
never	1
heard	1
of	1
orange,	1
though	1
it	1
might	1
turn	1
quite	1
unconsciously	1
into	1
green.	1
Against	1
it	1
the	1
tops,	1
one	1
might	1
say	1
the	1
turrets,	1
of	1
the	1
clipt	1
and	1
ordered	1
trees	1
were	1
outlined	1
in	1
that	1
shade	1
of	1
veiled	1
violet	1
which	1
tints	1
the	1
tops	1
of	1
lavender.	1
A	1
white	1
early	1
moon	1
was	1
hardly	1
traceable	1
upon	1
that	1
delicate	1
yellow.	1
MacIan,	1
I	1
say,	1
will	1
remember	1
this	1
tender	1
and	1
transparent	1
evening,	1
partly	1
because	1
of	1
its	1
virgin	1
gold	1
and	1
silver,	1
and	1
partly	1
because	1
he	1
passed	1
beneath	1
it	1
through	1
the	1
most	1
horrible	1
instant	1
of	1
his	1
life.	1
Turnbull	1
was	1
sitting	1
on	1
his	1
seat	1
on	1
the	1
lawn,	1
and	1
the	1
golden	1
evening	1
impressed	1
even	1
his	1
positive	1
nature,	1
as	1
indeed	1
it	1
might	1
have	1
impressed	1
the	1
oxen	1
in	1
a	1
field.	1
He	1
was	1
shocked	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
idle	1
mood	1
of	1
awe	1
by	1
seeing	1
MacIan	1
break	1
from	1
behind	1
the	1
bushes	1
and	1
run	1
across	1
the	1
lawn	1
with	1
an	1
action	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
in	1
the	1
man	1
before,	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
experience	1
of	1
the	1
eccentric	1
humours	1
of	1
this	1
Celt.	1
MacIan	1
fell	1
on	1
the	1
bench,	1
shaking	1
it	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
rattled,	1
and	1
gripped	1
it	1
with	1
his	1
knees	1
like	1
one	1
in	1
dreadful	1
pain	1
of	1
body.	1
That	1
particular	1
run	1
and	1
tumble	1
is	1
typical	1
only	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
has	1
been	1
hit	1
by	1
some	1
sudden	1
and	1
incurable	1
evil,	1
who	1
is	1
bitten	1
by	1
a	1
viper	1
or	1
condemned	1
to	1
be	1
hanged.	1
Turnbull	1
looked	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
white	1
face	1
of	1
his	1
friend	1
and	1
enemy,	1
and	1
almost	1
turned	1
cold	1
at	1
what	1
he	1
saw	1
there.	1
He	1
had	1
seen	1
the	1
blue	1
but	1
gloomy	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
western	1
Highlander	1
troubled	1
by	1
as	1
many	1
tempests	1
as	1
his	1
own	1
west	1
Highland	1
seas,	1
but	1
there	1
had	1
always	1
been	1
a	1
fixed	1
star	1
of	1
faith	1
behind	1
the	1
storms.	1
Now	1
the	1
star	1
had	1
gone	1
out,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
only	1
misery.	1
Yet	1
MacIan	1
had	1
the	1
strength	1
to	1
answer	1
the	1
question	1
where	1
Turnbull,	1
taken	1
by	1
surprise,	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
strength	1
to	1
ask	1
it.	1
"They	1
are	1
right,	1
they	1
are	1
right!"	1
he	1
cried.	1
"O	1
my	1
God!	1
they	1
are	1
right,	1
Turnbull.	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
here!"	1
He	1
went	1
on	1
with	1
shapeless	1
fluency	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
no	1
longer	1
had	1
the	1
heart	1
to	1
choose	1
or	1
check	1
his	1
speech.	1
"I	1
suppose	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
guessed	1
long	1
ago--all	1
my	1
big	1
dreams	1
and	1
schemes--and	1
everyone	1
being	1
against	1
us--but	1
I	1
was	1
stuck	1
up,	1
you	1
know."	1
"Do	1
tell	1
me	1
about	1
it,	1
really,"	1
cried	1
the	1
atheist,	1
and,	1
faced	1
with	1
the	1
furnace	1
of	1
the	1
other's	1
pain,	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
notice	1
that	1
he	1
spoke	1
with	1
the	1
affection	1
of	1
a	1
father.	1
"I	1
am	1
mad,	1
Turnbull,"	1
said	1
Evan,	1
with	1
a	1
dead	1
clearness	1
of	1
speech,	1
and	1
leant	1
back	1
against	1
the	1
garden	1
seat.	1
"Nonsense,"	1
said	1
the	1
other,	1
clutching	1
at	1
the	1
obvious	1
cue	1
of	1
benevolent	1
brutality,	1
"this	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
your	1
silly	1
moods."	1
MacIan	1
shook	1
his	1
head.	1
"I	1
know	1
enough	1
about	1
myself,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"to	1
allow	1
for	1
any	1
mood,	1
though	1
it	1
opened	1
heaven	1
or	1
hell.	1
But	1
to	1
see	1
things--to	1
see	1
them	1
walking	1
solid	1
in	1
the	1
sun--things	1
that	1
can't	1
be	1
there--real	1
mystics	1
never	1
do	1
that,	1
Turnbull."	1
"What	1
things?"	1
asked	1
the	1
other,	1
incredulously.	1
MacIan	1
lowered	1
his	1
voice.	1
"I	1
saw	1
_her_,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"three	1
minutes	1
ago--walking	1
here	1
in	1
this	1
hell	1
yard."	1
Between	1
trying	1
to	1
look	1
scornful	1
and	1
really	1
looking	1
startled,	1
Turnbull's	1
face	1
was	1
confused	1
enough	1
to	1
emit	1
no	1
speech,	1
and	1
Evan	1
went	1
on	1
in	1
monotonous	1
sincerity:	1
"I	1
saw	1
her	1
walk	1
behind	1
those	1
blessed	1
trees	1
against	1
that	1
holy	1
sky	1
of	1
gold	1
as	1
plain	1
as	1
I	1
can	1
see	1
her	1
whenever	1
I	1
shut	1
my	1
eyes.	1
I	1
did	1
shut	1
them,	1
and	1
opened	1
them	1
again,	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
still	1
there--that	1
is,	1
of	1
course,	1
she	1
wasn't----	1
She	1
still	1
had	1
a	1
little	1
fur	1
round	1
her	1
neck,	1
but	1
her	1
dress	1
was	1
a	1
shade	1
brighter	1
than	1
when	1
I	1
really	1
saw	1
her."	1
"My	1
dear	1
fellow,"	1
cried	1
Turnbull,	1
rallying	1
a	1
hearty	1
laugh,	1
"the	1
fancies	1
have	1
really	1
got	1
hold	1
of	1
you.	1
You	1
mistook	1
some	1
other	1
poor	1
girl	1
here	1
for	1
her."	1
"Mistook	1
some	1
other----"	1
said	1
MacIan,	1
and	1
words	1
failed	1
him	1
altogether.	1
They	1
sat	1
for	1
some	1
moments	1
in	1
the	1
mellow	1
silence	1
of	1
the	1
evening	1
garden,	1
a	1
silence	1
that	1
was	1
stifling	1
for	1
the	1
sceptic,	1
but	1
utterly	1
empty	1
and	1
final	1
for	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
faith.	1
At	1
last	1
he	1
broke	1
out	1
again	1
with	1
the	1
words:	1
"Well,	1
anyhow,	1
if	1
I'm	1
mad,	1
I'm	1
glad	1
I'm	1
mad	1
on	1
that."	1
Turnbull	1
murmured	1
some	1
clumsy	1
deprecation,	1
and	1
sat	1
stolidly	1
smoking	1
to	1
collect	1
his	1
thoughts;	1
the	1
next	1
instant	1
he	1
had	1
all	1
his	1
nerves	1
engaged	1
in	1
the	1
mere	1
effort	1
to	1
sit	1
still.	1
Across	1
the	1
clear	1
space	1
of	1
cold	1
silver	1
and	1
a	1
pale	1
lemon	1
sky	1
which	1
was	1
left	1
by	1
the	1
gap	1
in	1
the	1
ilex-trees	1
there	1
passed	1
a	1
slim,	1
dark	1
figure,	1
a	1
profile	1
and	1
the	1
poise	1
of	1
a	1
dark	1
head	1
like	1
a	1
bird's,	1
which	1
really	1
pinned	1
him	1
to	1
his	1
seat	1
with	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
coincidence.	1
With	1
an	1
effort	1
he	1
got	1
to	1
his	1
feet,	1
and	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
voice	1
of	1
affected	1
insouciance:	1
"By	1
George!	1
MacIan,	1
she	1
is	1
uncommonly	1
like----"	1
"What!"	1
cried	1
MacIan,	1
with	1
a	1
leap	1
of	1
eagerness	1
that	1
was	1
heart-breaking,	1
"do	1
you	1
see	1
her,	1
too?"	1
And	1
the	1
blaze	1
came	1
back	1
into	1
the	1
centre	1
of	1
his	1
eyes.	1
Turnbull's	1
tawny	1
eyebrows	1
were	1
pulled	1
together	1
with	1
a	1
peculiar	1
frown	1
of	1
curiosity,	1
and	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
he	1
walked	1
quickly	1
across	1
the	1
lawn.	1
MacIan	1
sat	1
rigid,	1
but	1
peered	1
after	1
him	1
with	1
open	1
and	1
parched	1
lips.	1
He	1
saw	1
the	1
sight	1
which	1
either	1
proved	1
him	1
sane	1
or	1
proved	1
the	1
whole	1
universe	1
half-witted;	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
flesh	1
approach	1
that	1
beautiful	1
phantom,	1
saw	1
their	1
gestures	1
of	1
recognition,	1
and	1
saw	1
them	1
against	1
the	1
sunset	1
joining	1
hands.	1
He	1
could	1
stand	1
it	1
no	1
longer,	1
but	1
ran	1
across	1
to	1
the	1
path,	1
turned	1
the	1
corner	1
and	1
saw	1
standing	1
quite	1
palpable	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
sunlight,	1
talking	1
with	1
a	1
casual	1
grace	1
to	1
Turnbull,	1
the	1
face	1
and	1
figure	1
which	1
had	1
filled	1
his	1
midnights	1
with	1
frightfully	1
vivid	1
or	1
desperately	1
half-forgotten	1
features.	1
She	1
advanced	1
quite	1
pleasantly	1
and	1
coolly,	1
and	1
put	1
out	1
her	1
hand.	1
The	1
moment	1
that	1
he	1
touched	1
it	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
sane	1
even	1
if	1
the	1
solar	1
system	1
was	1
crazy.	1
She	1
was	1
entirely	1
elegant	1
and	1
unembarrassed.	1
That	1
is	1
the	1
awful	1
thing	1
about	1
women--they	1
refuse	1
to	1
be	1
emotional	1
at	1
emotional	1
moments,	1
upon	1
some	1
such	1
ludicrous	1
pretext	1
as	1
there	1
being	1
someone	1
else	1
there.	1
But	1
MacIan	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
condition	1
of	1
criticism	1
much	1
less	1
than	1
the	1
average	1
masculine	1
one,	1
being	1
in	1
fact	1
merely	1
overturned	1
by	1
the	1
rushing	1
riddle	1
of	1
the	1
events.	1
Evan	1
does	1
not	1
know	1
to	1
this	1
day	1
what	1
particular	1
question	1
he	1
asked,	1
but	1
he	1
vividly	1
remembers	1
that	1
she	1
answered,	1
and	1
every	1
line	1
or	1
fluctuation	1
of	1
her	1
face	1
as	1
she	1
said	1
it.	1
"Oh,	1
don't	1
you	1
know?"	1
she	1
said,	1
smiling,	1
and	1
suddenly	1
lifting	1
her	1
level	1
brown	1
eyebrows.	1
"Haven't	1
you	1
heard	1
the	1
news?	1
I'm	1
a	1
lunatic."	1
Then	1
she	1
added	1
after	1
a	1
short	1
pause,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
pride:	1
"I've	1
got	1
a	1
certificate."	1
Her	1
manner,	1
by	1
the	1
matchless	1
social	1
stoicism	1
of	1
her	1
sex,	1
was	1
entirely	1
suited	1
to	1
a	1
drawing-room,	1
but	1
Evan's	1
reply	1
fell	1
somewhat	1
far	1
short	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
standard,	1
as	1
he	1
only	1
said:	1
"What	1
the	1
devil	1
in	1
hell	1
does	1
all	1
this	1
nonsense	1
mean?"	1
"Really,"	1
said	1
the	1
young	1
lady,	1
and	1
laughed.	1
"I	1
beg	1
your	1
pardon,"	1
said	1
the	1
unhappy	1
young	1
man,	1
rather	1
wildly,	1
"but	1
what	1
I	1
mean	1
is,	1
why	1
are	1
you	1
here	1
in	1
an	1
asylum?"	1
The	1
young	1
woman	1
broke	1
again	1
into	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
maddening	1
and	1
mysterious	1
laughs	1
of	1
femininity.	1
Then	1
she	1
composed	1
her	1
features,	1
and	1
replied	1
with	1
equal	1
dignity:	1
"Well,	1
if	1
it	1
comes	1
to	1
that,	1
why	1
are	1
you?"	1
The	1
fact	1
that	1
Turnbull	1
had	1
strolled	1
away	1
and	1
was	1
investigating	1
rhododendrons	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
due	1
to	1
Evan's	1
successful	1
prayers	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
world,	1
or	1
possibly	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
pretty	1
successful	1
experience	1
of	1
this	1
one.	1
But	1
though	1
they	1
two	1
were	1
as	1
isolated	1
as	1
a	1
new	1
Adam	1
and	1
Eve	1
in	1
a	1
pretty	1
ornamental	1
Eden,	1
the	1
lady	1
did	1
not	1
relax	1
by	1
an	1
inch	1
the	1
rigour	1
of	1
her	1
badinage.	1
"I	1
am	1
locked	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
madhouse,"	1
said	1
Evan,	1
with	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
stiff	1
pride,	1
"because	1
I	1
tried	1
to	1
keep	1
my	1
promise	1
to	1
you."	1
"Quite	1
so,"	1
answered	1
the	1
inexplicable	1
lady,	1
nodding	1
with	1
a	1
perfectly	1
blazing	1
smile,	1
"and	1
I	1
am	1
locked	1
up	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
me	1
you	1
promised."	1
"It	1
is	1
outrageous!"	1
cried	1
Evan;	1
"it	1
is	1
impossible!"	1
"Oh,	1
you	1
can	1
see	1
my	1
certificate	1
if	1
you	1
like,"	1
she	1
replied	1
with	1
some	1
hauteur.	1
MacIan	1
stared	1
at	1
her	1
and	1
then	1
at	1
his	1
boots,	1
and	1
then	1
at	1
the	1
sky	1
and	1
then	1
at	1
her	1
again.	1
He	1
was	1
quite	1
sure	1
now	1
that	1
he	1
himself	1
was	1
not	1
mad,	1
and	1
the	1
fact	1
rather	1
added	1
to	1
his	1
perplexity.	1
Then	1
he	1
drew	1
nearer	1
to	1
her,	1
and	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
dry	1
and	1
dreadful	1
voice:	1
"Oh,	1
don't	1
condescend	1
to	1
play	1
the	1
fool	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
fool	1
as	1
me.	1
Are	1
you	1
really	1
locked	1
up	1
here	1
as	1
a	1
patient--because	1
you	1
helped	1
us	1
to	1
escape?"	1
"Yes,"	1
she	1
said,	1
still	1
smiling,	1
but	1
her	1
steady	1
voice	1
had	1
a	1
shake	1
in	1
it.	1
Evan	1
flung	1
his	1
big	1
elbow	1
across	1
his	1
forehead	1
and	1
burst	1
into	1
tears.	1
The	1
pure	1
lemon	1
of	1
the	1
sky	1
faded	1
into	1
purer	1
white	1
as	1
the	1
great	1
sunset	1
silently	1
collapsed.	1
The	1
birds	1
settled	1
back	1
into	1
the	1
trees;	1
the	1
moon	1
began	1
to	1
glow	1
with	1
its	1
own	1
light.	1
Mr.	1
James	1
Turnbull	1
continued	1
his	1
botanical	1
researches	1
into	1
the	1
structure	1
of	1
the	1
rhododendron.	1
But	1
the	1
lady	1
did	1
not	1
move	1
an	1
inch	1
until	1
Evan	1
had	1
flung	1
up	1
his	1
face	1
again;	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
did	1
he	1
saw	1
by	1
the	1
last	1
gleam	1
of	1
sunlight	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
only	1
his	1
face	1
that	1
was	1
wet.	1
Mr.	1
James	1
Turnbull	1
had	1
all	1
his	1
life	1
professed	1
a	1
profound	1
interest	1
in	1
physical	1
science,	1
and	1
the	1
phenomena	1
of	1
a	1
good	1
garden	1
were	1
really	1
a	1
pleasure	1
to	1
him;	1
but	1
after	1
three-quarters	1
of	1
an	1
hour	1
or	1
so	1
even	1
the	1
apostle	1
of	1
science	1
began	1
to	1
find	1
rhododendrus	1
a	1
bore,	1
and	1
was	1
somewhat	1
relieved	1
when	1
an	1
unexpected	1
development	1
of	1
events	1
obliged	1
him	1
to	1
transfer	1
his	1
researches	1
to	1
the	1
equally	1
interesting	1
subject	1
of	1
hollyhocks,	1
which	1
grew	1
some	1
fifty	1
feet	1
farther	1
along	1
the	1
path.	1
The	1
ostensible	1
cause	1
of	1
his	1
removal	1
was	1
the	1
unexpected	1
reappearance	1
of	1
his	1
two	1
other	1
acquaintances	1
walking	1
and	1
talking	1
laboriously	1
along	1
the	1
way,	1
with	1
the	1
black	1
head	1
bent	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
brown	1
one.	1
Even	1
hollyhocks	1
detained	1
Turnbull	1
but	1
a	1
short	1
time.	1
Having	1
rapidly	1
absorbed	1
all	1
the	1
important	1
principles	1
affecting	1
the	1
growth	1
of	1
those	1
vegetables,	1
he	1
jumped	1
over	1
a	1
flower-bed	1
and	1
walked	1
back	1
into	1
the	1
building.	1
The	1
other	1
two	1
came	1
up	1
along	1
the	1
slow	1
course	1
of	1
the	1
path	1
talking	1
and	1
talking.	1
No	1
one	1
but	1
God	1
knows	1
what	1
they	1
said	1
(for	1
they	1
certainly	1
have	1
forgotten),	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
remembered	1
it	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
repeat	1
it.	1
When	1
they	1
parted	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
walk	1
she	1
put	1
out	1
her	1
hand	1
again	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
well-bred	1
way,	1
although	1
it	1
trembled;	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
restrain	1
a	1
gesture	1
as	1
he	1
let	1
it	1
fall.	1
"If	1
it	1
is	1
really	1
always	1
to	1
be	1
like	1
this,"	1
he	1
said,	1
thickly,	1
"it	1
would	1
not	1
matter	1
if	1
we	1
were	1
here	1
for	1
ever."	1
"You	1
tried	1
to	1
kill	1
yourself	1
four	1
times	1
for	1
me,"	1
she	1
said,	1
unsteadily,	1
"and	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
chained	1
up	1
as	1
a	1
madwoman	1
for	1
you.	1
I	1
really	1
think	1
that	1
after	1
that----"	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
know,"	1
said	1
Evan	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice,	1
looking	1
down.	1
"After	1
that	1
we	1
belong	1
to	1
each	1
other.	1
We	1
are	1
sort	1
of	1
sold	1
to	1
each	1
other--until	1
the	1
stars	1
fall."	1
Then	1
he	1
looked	1
up	1
suddenly,	1
and	1
said:	1
"By	1
the	1
way,	1
what	1
is	1
your	1
name?"	1
"My	1
name	1
is	1
Beatrice	1
Drake,"	1
she	1
replied	1
with	1
complete	1
gravity.	1
"You	1
can	1
see	1
it	1
on	1
my	1
certificate	1
of	1
lunacy."	1
XIX.	1
THE	1
LAST	1
PARLEY	1
Turnbull	1
walked	1
away,	1
wildly	1
trying	1
to	1
explain	1
to	1
himself	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
two	1
personal	1
acquaintances	1
so	1
different	1
as	1
Vane	1
and	1
the	1
girl.	1
As	1
he	1
skirted	1
a	1
low	1
hedge	1
of	1
laurel,	1
an	1
enormously	1
tall	1
young	1
man	1
leapt	1
over	1
it,	1
stood	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
him,	1
and	1
almost	1
fell	1
on	1
his	1
neck	1
as	1
if	1
seeking	1
to	1
embrace	1
him.	1
"Don't	1
you	1
know	1
me?"	1
almost	1
sobbed	1
the	1
young	1
man,	1
who	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
highest	1
spirits.	1
"Ain't	1
I	1
written	1
on	1
your	1
heart,	1
old	1
boy?	1
I	1
say,	1
what	1
did	1
you	1
do	1
with	1
my	1
yacht?"	1
"Take	1
your	1
arms	1
off	1
my	1
neck,"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
irritably.	1
"Are	1
you	1
mad?"	1
The	1
young	1
man	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
gravel	1
path	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
ecstasies	1
of	1
laughter.	1
"No,	1
that's	1
just	1
the	1
fun	1
of	1
it--I'm	1
not	1
mad,"	1
he	1
replied.	1
"They've	1
shut	1
me	1
up	1
in	1
this	1
place,	1
and	1
I'm	1
not	1
mad."	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
off	1
again	1
into	1
mirth	1
as	1
innocent	1
as	1
wedding-bells.	1
Turnbull,	1
whose	1
powers	1
of	1
surprise	1
were	1
exhausted,	1
rolled	1
his	1
round	1
grey	1
eyes	1
and	1
said,	1
"Mr.	1
Wilkinson,	1
I	1
think,"	1
because	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
think	1
of	1
anything	1
else	1
to	1
say.	1
The	1
tall	1
man	1
sitting	1
on	1
the	1
gravel	1
bowed	1
with	1
urbanity,	1
and	1
said:	1
"Quite	1
at	1
your	1
service.	1
Not	1
to	1
be	1
confused	1
with	1
the	1
Wilkinsons	1
of	1
Cumberland;	1
and	1
as	1
I	1
say,	1
old	1
boy,	1
what	1
have	1
you	1
done	1
with	1
my	1
yacht?	1
You	1
see,	1
they've	1
locked	1
me	1
up	1
here--in	1
this	1
garden--and	1
a	1
yacht	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
occupation	1
for	1
an	1
unmarried	1
man."	1
"I	1
am	1
really	1
horribly	1
sorry,"	1
began	1
Turnbull,	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
stage	1
of	1
bated	1
bewilderment	1
and	1
exasperation,	1
"but	1
really----"	1
"Oh,	1
I	1
can	1
see	1
you	1
can't	1
have	1
it	1
on	1
you	1
at	1
the	1
moment,"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Wilkinson	1
with	1
much	1
intellectual	1
magnanimity.	1
"Well,	1
the	1
fact	1
is----"	1
began	1
Turnbull	1
again,	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
phrase	1
was	1
frozen	1
on	1
his	1
mouth,	1
for	1
round	1
the	1
corner	1
came	1
the	1
goatlike	1
face	1
and	1
gleaming	1
eye-glasses	1
of	1
Dr.	1
Quayle.	1
"Ah,	1
my	1
dear	1
Mr.	1
Wilkinson,"	1
said	1
the	1
doctor,	1
as	1
if	1
delighted	1
at	1
a	1
coincidence;	1
"and	1
Mr.	1
Turnbull,	1
too.	1
Why,	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Turnbull."	1
Mr.	1
Turnbull	1
made	1
some	1
movement	1
rather	1
of	1
surrender	1
than	1
assent,	1
and	1
the	1
doctor	1
caught	1
it	1
up	1
exquisitely,	1
showing	1
even	1
more	1
of	1
his	1
two	1
front	1
teeth.	1
"I	1
am	1
sure	1
Mr.	1
Wilkinson	1
will	1
excuse	1
us	1
a	1
moment."	1
And	1
with	1
flying	1
frock-coat	1
he	1
led	1
Turnbull	1
rapidly	1
round	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
a	1
path.	1
"My	1
dear	1
sir,"	1
he	1
said,	1
in	1
a	1
quite	1
affectionate	1
manner,	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
mind	1
telling	1
you--you	1
are	1
such	1
a	1
very	1
hopeful	1
case--you	1
understand	1
so	1
well	1
the	1
scientific	1
point	1
of	1
view;	1
and	1
I	1
don't	1
like	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
bothered	1
by	1
the	1
really	1
hopeless	1
cases.	1
They	1
are	1
monotonous	1
and	1
maddening.	1
The	1
man	1
you	1
have	1
just	1
been	1
talking	1
to,	1
poor	1
fellow,	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
strongest	1
cases	1
of	1
pure	1
_idee	1
fixe_	1
that	1
we	1
have.	1
It's	1
very	1
sad,	1
and	1
I'm	1
afraid	1
utterly	1
incurable.	1
He	1
keeps	1
on	1
telling	1
everybody"--and	1
the	1
doctor	1
lowered	1
his	1
voice	1
confidentially--"he	1
tells	1
everybody	1
that	1
two	1
people	1
have	1
taken	1
is	1
yacht.	1
His	1
account	1
of	1
how	1
he	1
lost	1
it	1
is	1
quite	1
incoherent."	1
Turnbull	1
stamped	1
his	1
foot	1
on	1
the	1
gravel	1
path,	1
and	1
called	1
out:	1
"Oh,	1
I	1
can't	1
stand	1
this.	1
Really----"	1
"I	1
know,	1
I	1
know,"	1
said	1
the	1
psychologist,	1
mournfully;	1
"it	1
is	1
a	1
most	1
melancholy	1
case,	1
and	1
also	1
fortunately	1
a	1
very	1
rare	1
one.	1
It	1
is	1
so	1
rare,	1
in	1
fact,	1
that	1
in	1
one	1
classification	1
of	1
these	1
maladies	1
it	1
is	1
entered	1
under	1
a	1
heading	1
by	1
itself--Perdinavititis,	1
mental	1
inflammation	1
creating	1
the	1
impression	1
that	1
one	1
has	1
lost	1
a	1
ship.	1
Really,"	1
he	1
added,	1
with	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
half-embarrassed	1
guilt,	1
"it's	1
rather	1
a	1
feather	1
in	1
my	1
cap.	1
I	1
discovered	1
the	1
only	1
existing	1
case	1
of	1
perdinavititis."	1
"But	1
this	1
won't	1
do,	1
doctor,"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
almost	1
tearing	1
his	1
hair,	1
"this	1
really	1
won't	1
do.	1
The	1
man	1
really	1
did	1
lose	1
a	1
ship.	1
Indeed,	1
not	1
to	1
put	1
too	1
fine	1
a	1
point	1
on	1
it,	1
I	1
took	1
his	1
ship."	1
Dr.	1
Quayle	1
swung	1
round	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
so	1
that	1
his	1
silk-lined	1
overcoat	1
rustled,	1
and	1
stared	1
singularly	1
at	1
Turnbull.	1
Then	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
hurried	1
amiability:	1
"Why,	1
of	1
course	1
you	1
did.	1
Quite	1
so,	1
quite	1
so,"	1
and	1
with	1
courteous	1
gestures	1
went	1
striding	1
up	1
the	1
garden	1
path.	1
Under	1
the	1
first	1
laburnum-tree	1
he	1
stopped,	1
however,	1
and	1
pulling	1
out	1
his	1
pencil	1
and	1
notebook	1
wrote	1
down	1
feverishly:	1
"Singular	1
development	1
in	1
the	1
Elenthero-maniac,	1
Turnbull.	1
Sudden	1
manifestation	1
of	1
Rapinavititis--the	1
delusion	1
that	1
one	1
has	1
stolen	1
a	1
ship.	1
First	1
case	1
ever	1
recorded."	1
Turnbull	1
stood	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
staggered	1
into	1
stillness.	1
Then	1
he	1
ran	1
raging	1
round	1
the	1
garden	1
to	1
find	1
MacIan,	1
just	1
as	1
a	1
husband,	1
even	1
a	1
bad	1
husband,	1
will	1
run	1
raging	1
to	1
find	1
his	1
wife	1
if	1
he	1
is	1
full	1
of	1
a	1
furious	1
query.	1
He	1
found	1
MacIan	1
stalking	1
moodily	1
about	1
the	1
half-lit	1
garden,	1
after	1
his	1
extraordinary	1
meeting	1
with	1
Beatrice.	1
No	1
one	1
who	1
saw	1
his	1
slouching	1
stride	1
and	1
sunken	1
head	1
could	1
have	1
known	1
that	1
his	1
soul	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
seventh	1
heaven	1
of	1
ecstasy.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
think;	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
very	1
definitely	1
desire.	1
He	1
merely	1
wallowed	1
in	1
memories,	1
chiefly	1
in	1
material	1
memories;	1
words	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
certain	1
cadence	1
or	1
trivial	1
turns	1
of	1
the	1
neck	1
or	1
wrist.	1
Into	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
his	1
stationary	1
and	1
senseless	1
enjoyment	1
were	1
thrust	1
abruptly	1
the	1
projecting	1
elbow	1
and	1
the	1
projecting	1
red	1
beard	1
of	1
Turnbull.	1
MacIan	1
stepped	1
back	1
a	1
little,	1
and	1
the	1
soul	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
came	1
very	1
slowly	1
to	1
its	1
windows.	1
When	1
James	1
Turnbull	1
had	1
the	1
glittering	1
sword-point	1
planted	1
upon	1
his	1
breast	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
far	1
less	1
danger.	1
For	1
three	1
pulsating	1
seconds	1
after	1
the	1
interruption	1
MacIan	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
mood	1
to	1
have	1
murdered	1
his	1
father.	1
And	1
yet	1
his	1
whole	1
emotional	1
anger	1
fell	1
from	1
him	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
Turnbull's	1
face,	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
eyes	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
bursting	1
from	1
the	1
head	1
like	1
bullets.	1
All	1
the	1
fire	1
and	1
fragrance	1
even	1
of	1
young	1
and	1
honourable	1
love	1
faded	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
before	1
that	1
stiff	1
agony	1
of	1
interrogation.	1
"Are	1
you	1
hurt,	1
Turnbull?"	1
he	1
asked,	1
anxiously.	1
"I	1
am	1
dying,"	1
answered	1
the	1
other	1
quite	1
calmly.	1
"I	1
am	1
in	1
the	1
quite	1
literal	1
sense	1
of	1
the	1
words	1
dying	1
to	1
know	1
something.	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
all	1
this	1
can	1
possibly	1
mean."	1
MacIan	1
did	1
not	1
answer,	1
and	1
he	1
continued	1
with	1
asperity:	1
"You	1
are	1
still	1
thinking	1
about	1
that	1
girl,	1
but	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
the	1
whole	1
thing	1
is	1
incredible.	1
She's	1
not	1
the	1
only	1
person	1
here.	1
I've	1
met	1
the	1
fellow	1
Wilkinson,	1
whose	1
yacht	1
we	1
lost.	1
I've	1
met	1
the	1
very	1
magistrate	1
you	1
were	1
hauled	1
up	1
to	1
when	1
you	1
broke	1
my	1
window.	1
What	1
can	1
it	1
mean--meeting	1
all	1
these	1
old	1
people	1
again?	1
One	1
never	1
meets	1
such	1
old	1
friends	1
again	1
except	1
in	1
a	1
dream."	1
Then	1
after	1
a	1
silence	1
he	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
rending	1
sincerity:	1
"Are	1
you	1
really	1
there,	1
Evan?	1
Have	1
you	1
ever	1
been	1
really	1
there?	1
Am	1
I	1
simply	1
dreaming?"	1
MacIan	1
had	1
been	1
listening	1
with	1
a	1
living	1
silence	1
to	1
every	1
word,	1
and	1
now	1
his	1
face	1
flamed	1
with	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
rare	1
revelations	1
of	1
life.	1
"No,	1
you	1
good	1
atheist,"	1
he	1
cried;	1
"no,	1
you	1
clean,	1
courteous,	1
reverent,	1
pious	1
old	1
blasphemer.	1
No,	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
dreaming--you	1
are	1
waking	1
up."	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
mean?"	1
"There	1
are	1
two	1
states	1
where	1
one	1
meets	1
so	1
many	1
old	1
friends,"	1
said	1
MacIan;	1
"one	1
is	1
a	1
dream,	1
the	1
other	1
is	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
world."	1
"And	1
you	1
say----"	1
"I	1
say	1
this	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
dream,"	1
said	1
Evan	1
in	1
a	1
ringing	1
voice.	1
"You	1
really	1
mean	1
to	1
suggest----"	1
began	1
Turnbull.	1
"Be	1
silent!	1
or	1
I	1
shall	1
say	1
it	1
all	1
wrong,"	1
said	1
MacIan,	1
breathing	1
hard.	1
"It's	1
hard	1
to	1
explain,	1
anyhow.	1
An	1
apocalypse	1
is	1
the	1
opposite	1
of	1
a	1
dream.	1
A	1
dream	1
is	1
falser	1
than	1
the	1
outer	1
life.	1
But	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
is	1
more	1
actual	1
than	1
the	1
world	1
it	1
ends.	1
I	1
don't	1
say	1
this	1
is	1
really	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
but	1
it's	1
something	1
like	1
that--it's	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
something.	1
All	1
the	1
people	1
are	1
crowding	1
into	1
one	1
corner.	1
Everything	1
is	1
coming	1
to	1
a	1
point."	1
"What	1
is	1
the	1
point?"	1
asked	1
Turnbull.	1
"I	1
can't	1
see	1
it,"	1
said	1
Evan;	1
"it	1
is	1
too	1
large	1
and	1
plain."	1
Then	1
after	1
a	1
silence	1
he	1
said:	1
"I	1
can't	1
see	1
it--and	1
yet	1
I	1
will	1
try	1
to	1
describe	1
it.	1
Turnbull,	1
three	1
days	1
ago	1
I	1
saw	1
quite	1
suddenly	1
that	1
our	1
duel	1
was	1
not	1
right	1
after	1
all."	1
"Three	1
days	1
ago!"	1
repeated	1
Turnbull.	1
"When	1
and	1
why	1
did	1
this	1
illumination	1
occur?"	1
"I	1
knew	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
quite	1
right,"	1
answered	1
Evan,	1
"the	1
moment	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
round	1
eyes	1
of	1
that	1
old	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
cell."	1
"Old	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
cell!"	1
repeated	1
his	1
wondering	1
companion.	1
"Do	1
you	1
mean	1
the	1
poor	1
old	1
idiot	1
who	1
likes	1
spikes	1
to	1
stick	1
out?"	1
"Yes,"	1
said	1
MacIan,	1
after	1
a	1
slight	1
pause,	1
"I	1
mean	1
the	1
poor	1
old	1
idiot	1
who	1
likes	1
spikes	1
to	1
stick	1
out.	1
When	1
I	1
saw	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
heard	1
his	1
old	1
croaking	1
accent,	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
really	1
have	1
been	1
right	1
to	1
kill	1
you.	1
It	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
venial	1
sin."	1
"I	1
am	1
much	1
obliged,"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
gruffly.	1
"You	1
must	1
give	1
me	1
time,"	1
said	1
MacIan,	1
quite	1
patiently,	1
"for	1
I	1
am	1
trying	1
to	1
tell	1
the	1
whole	1
truth.	1
I	1
am	1
trying	1
to	1
tell	1
more	1
of	1
it	1
than	1
I	1
know."	1
"So	1
you	1
see	1
I	1
confess"--he	1
went	1
on	1
with	1
laborious	1
distinctness--	1
"I	1
confess	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
called	1
our	1
duel	1
mad	1
were	1
right	1
in	1
a	1
way.	1
I	1
would	1
confess	1
it	1
to	1
old	1
Cumberland	1
Vane	1
and	1
his	1
eye-glass.	1
I	1
would	1
confess	1
it	1
even	1
to	1
that	1
old	1
ass	1
in	1
brown	1
flannel	1
who	1
talked	1
to	1
us	1
about	1
Love.	1
Yes,	1
they	1
are	1
right	1
in	1
a	1
way.	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
little	1
mad."	1
He	1
stopped	1
and	1
wiped	1
his	1
brow	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
literally	1
doing	1
heavy	1
labour.	1
Then	1
he	1
went	1
on:	1
"I	1
am	1
a	1
little	1
mad;	1
but,	1
after	1
all,	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
a	1
little	1
madness.	1
When	1
hundreds	1
of	1
high-minded	1
men	1
had	1
fought	1
duesl	1
about	1
a	1
jostle	1
with	1
the	1
elbow	1
or	1
the	1
ace	1
of	1
spades,	1
the	1
whole	1
world	1
need	1
not	1
have	1
gone	1
wild	1
over	1
my	1
one	1
little	1
wildness.	1
Plenty	1
of	1
other	1
people	1
have	1
killed	1
themselves	1
between	1
then	1
and	1
now.	1
But	1
all	1
England	1
has	1
gone	1
into	1
captivity	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
take	1
us	1
captive.	1
All	1
England	1
has	1
turned	1
into	1
a	1
lunatic	1
asylum	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
prove	1
us	1
lunatics.	1
Compared	1
with	1
the	1
general	1
public,	1
I	1
might	1
positively	1
be	1
called	1
sane."	1
He	1
stopped	1
again,	1
and	1
went	1
on	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
air	1
of	1
travailing	1
with	1
the	1
truth:	1
"When	1
I	1
saw	1
that,	1
I	1
saw	1
everything;	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
Church	1
and	1
the	1
world.	1
The	1
Church	1
in	1
its	1
earthly	1
action	1
has	1
really	1
touched	1
morbid	1
things--tortures	1
and	1
bleeding	1
visions	1
and	1
blasts	1
of	1
extermination.	1
The	1
Church	1
has	1
had	1
her	1
madnesses,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
one	1
of	1
them.	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
massacre	1
of	1
St.	1
Bartholomew.	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
Inquisition	1
of	1
Spain.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
say	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
never	1
gone	1
mad,	1
but	1
I	1
say	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
fit	1
to	1
act	1
as	1
keepers	1
to	1
our	1
enemies.	1
Massacre	1
is	1
wicked	1
even	1
with	1
a	1
provocation,	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
Bartholomew.	1
But	1
your	1
modern	1
Nietzsche	1
will	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
massacre	1
would	1
be	1
glorious	1
without	1
a	1
provocation.	1
Torture	1
should	1
be	1
violently	1
stopped,	1
though	1
the	1
Church	1
is	1
doing	1
it.	1
But	1
your	1
modern	1
Tolstoy	1
will	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
it	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
violently	1
stopped	1
whoever	1
is	1
doing	1
it.	1
In	1
the	1
long	1
run,	1
which	1
is	1
most	1
mad--the	1
Church	1
or	1
the	1
world?	1
Which	1
is	1
madder,	1
the	1
Spanish	1
priest	1
who	1
permitted	1
tyranny,	1
or	1
the	1
Prussian	1
sophist	1
who	1
admired	1
it?	1
Which	1
is	1
madder,	1
the	1
Russian	1
priest	1
who	1
discourages	1
righteous	1
rebellion,	1
or	1
the	1
Russian	1
novelist	1
who	1
forbids	1
it?	1
That	1
is	1
the	1
final	1
and	1
blasting	1
test.	1
The	1
world	1
left	1
to	1
itself	1
grows	1
wilder	1
than	1
any	1
creed.	1
A	1
few	1
days	1
ago	1
you	1
and	1
I	1
were	1
the	1
maddest	1
people	1
in	1
England.	1
Now,	1
by	1
God!	1
I	1
believe	1
we	1
are	1
the	1
sanest.	1
That	1
is	1
the	1
only	1
real	1
question--	1
whether	1
the	1
Church	1
is	1
really	1
madder	1
than	1
the	1
world.	1
Let	1
the	1
rationalists	1
run	1
their	1
own	1
race,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
see	1
where	1
_they_	1
end.	1
If	1
the	1
world	1
has	1
some	1
healthy	1
balance	1
other	1
than	1
God,	1
let	1
the	1
world	1
find	1
it.	1
Does	1
the	1
world	1
find	1
it?	1
Cut	1
the	1
world	1
loose,"	1
he	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
savage	1
gesture.	1
"Does	1
the	1
world	1
stand	1
on	1
its	1
own	1
end?	1
Does	1
it	1
stand,	1
or	1
does	1
it	1
stagger?"	1
Turnbull	1
remained	1
silent,	1
and	1
MacIan	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
looking	1
once	1
more	1
at	1
the	1
earth:	1
"It	1
staggers,	1
Turnbull.	1
It	1
cannot	1
stand	1
by	1
itself;	1
you	1
know	1
it	1
cannot.	1
It	1
has	1
been	1
the	1
sorrow	1
of	1
your	1
life.	1
Turnbull,	1
this	1
garden	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
dream,	1
but	1
an	1
apocalyptic	1
fulfilment.	1
This	1
garden	1
is	1
the	1
world	1
gone	1
mad."	1
Turnbull	1
did	1
not	1
move	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
listening	1
all	1
the	1
time;	1
yet,	1
somehow,	1
the	1
other	1
knew	1
that	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
he	1
was	1
listening	1
seriously.	1
"The	1
world	1
has	1
gone	1
mad,"	1
said	1
MacIan,	1
"and	1
it	1
has	1
gone	1
mad	1
about	1
Us.	1
The	1
world	1
takes	1
the	1
trouble	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
big	1
mistake	1
about	1
every	1
little	1
mistake	1
made	1
by	1
the	1
Church.	1
That	1
is	1
why	1
they	1
have	1
turned	1
ten	1
counties	1
to	1
a	1
madhouse;	1
that	1
is	1
why	1
crowds	1
of	1
kindly	1
people	1
are	1
poured	1
into	1
this	1
filthy	1
melting-pot.	1
Now	1
is	1
the	1
judgement	1
of	1
this	1
world.	1
The	1
Prince	1
of	1
this	1
World	1
is	1
judged,	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
judged	1
exactly	1
because	1
he	1
is	1
judging.	1
There	1
is	1
at	1
last	1
one	1
simple	1
solution	1
to	1
the	1
quarrel	1
between	1
the	1
ball	1
and	1
the	1
cross----"	1
Turnbull	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
started.	1
"The	1
ball	1
and----"	1
he	1
repeated.	1
"What	1
is	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
you?"	1
asked	1
MacIan.	1
"I	1
had	1
a	1
dream,"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
thickly	1
and	1
obscurely,	1
"in	1
which	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
cross	1
struck	1
crooked	1
and	1
the	1
ball	1
secure----"	1
"I	1
had	1
a	1
dream,"	1
said	1
MacIan,	1
"in	1
which	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
cross	1
erect	1
and	1
the	1
ball	1
invisible.	1
They	1
were	1
both	1
dreams	1
from	1
hell.	1
There	1
must	1
be	1
some	1
round	1
earth	1
to	1
plant	1
the	1
cross	1
upon.	1
But	1
here	1
is	1
the	1
awful	1
difference--that	1
the	1
round	1
world	1
will	1
not	1
consent	1
even	1
to	1
continue	1
round.	1
The	1
astronomers	1
are	1
always	1
telling	1
us	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
shaped	1
like	1
an	1
orange,	1
or	1
like	1
an	1
egg,	1
or	1
like	1
a	1
German	1
sausage.	1
They	1
beat	1
the	1
old	1
world	1
about	1
like	1
a	1
bladder	1
and	1
thump	1
it	1
into	1
a	1
thousand	1
shapeless	1
shapes.	1
Turnbull,	1
we	1
cannot	1
trust	1
the	1
ball	1
to	1
be	1
always	1
a	1
ball;	1
we	1
cannot	1
trust	1
reason	1
to	1
be	1
reasonable.	1
In	1
the	1
end	1
the	1
great	1
terrestrial	1
globe	1
will	1
go	1
quite	1
lop-sided,	1
and	1
only	1
the	1
cross	1
will	1
stand	1
upright."	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
long	1
silence,	1
and	1
then	1
Turnbull	1
said,	1
hesitatingly:	1
"Has	1
it	1
occurred	1
to	1
you	1
that	1
since--since	1
those	1
two	1
dreams,	1
or	1
whatever	1
they	1
were----"	1
"Well?"	1
murmured	1
MacIan.	1
"Since	1
then,"	1
went	1
on	1
Turnbull,	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
low	1
voice,	1
"since	1
then	1
we	1
have	1
never	1
even	1
looked	1
for	1
our	1
swords."	1
"You	1
are	1
right,"	1
answered	1
Evan	1
almost	1
inaudibly.	1
"We	1
have	1
found	1
something	1
which	1
we	1
both	1
hate	1
more	1
than	1
we	1
ever	1
hated	1
each	1
other,	1
and	1
I	1
think	1
I	1
know	1
its	1
name."	1
Turnbull	1
seemed	1
to	1
frown	1
and	1
flinch	1
for	1
a	1
moment.	1
"It	1
does	1
not	1
much	1
matter	1
what	1
you	1
call	1
it,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"so	1
long	1
as	1
you	1
keep	1
out	1
of	1
its	1
way."	1
The	1
bushes	1
broke	1
and	1
snapped	1
abruptly	1
behind	1
them,	1
and	1
a	1
very	1
tall	1
figure	1
towered	1
above	1
Turnbull	1
with	1
an	1
arrogant	1
stoop	1
and	1
a	1
projecting	1
chin,	1
a	1
chin	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
shape	1
showed	1
queerly	1
even	1
in	1
its	1
shadow	1
upon	1
the	1
path.	1
"You	1
see	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
so	1
easy,"	1
said	1
MacIan	1
between	1
his	1
teeth.	1
They	1
looked	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
Master,	1
but	1
looked	1
only	1
for	1
a	1
moment.	1
The	1
eyes	1
were	1
full	1
of	1
a	1
frozen	1
and	1
icy	1
wrath,	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
utterly	1
heartless	1
hatred.	1
His	1
voice	1
was	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
devoid	1
of	1
irony.	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
more	1
sarcasm	1
in	1
it	1
than	1
there	1
is	1
in	1
an	1
iron	1
club.	1
"You	1
will	1
be	1
inside	1
the	1
building	1
in	1
three	1
minutes,"	1
he	1
said,	1
with	1
pulverizing	1
precision,	1
"or	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
fired	1
on	1
by	1
the	1
artillery	1
at	1
all	1
the	1
windows.	1
There	1
is	1
too	1
much	1
talking	1
in	1
this	1
garden;	1
we	1
intend	1
to	1
close	1
it.	1
You	1
will	1
be	1
accommodated	1
indoors."	1
"Ah!"	1
said	1
MacIan,	1
with	1
a	1
long	1
and	1
satisfied	1
sigh,	1
"then	1
I	1
was	1
right."	1
And	1
he	1
turned	1
his	1
back	1
and	1
walked	1
obediently	1
towards	1
the	1
building.	1
Turnbull	1
seemed	1
to	1
canvass	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
the	1
notion	1
of	1
knocking	1
the	1
Master	1
down,	1
and	1
then	1
fell	1
under	1
the	1
same	1
almost	1
fairy	1
fatalism	1
as	1
his	1
companion.	1
In	1
some	1
strange	1
way	1
it	1
did	1
seem	1
that	1
the	1
more	1
smoothly	1
they	1
yielded,	1
the	1
more	1
swiftly	1
would	1
events	1
sweep	1
on	1
to	1
some	1
great	1
collision.	1
XX.	1
DIES	1
IRAE	1
As	1
they	1
advanced	1
towards	1
the	1
asylum	1
they	1
looked	1
up	1
at	1
its	1
rows	1
on	1
rows	1
of	1
windows,	1
and	1
understood	1
the	1
Master's	1
material	1
threat.	1
By	1
means	1
of	1
that	1
complex	1
but	1
concealed	1
machinery	1
which	1
ran	1
like	1
a	1
network	1
of	1
nerves	1
over	1
the	1
whole	1
fabric,	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
shot	1
out	1
under	1
every	1
window-ledge	1
rows	1
and	1
rows	1
of	1
polished-steel	1
cylinders,	1
the	1
cold	1
miracles	1
of	1
modern	1
gunnery.	1
They	1
commanded	1
the	1
whole	1
garden	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
country-side,	1
and	1
could	1
have	1
blown	1
to	1
pieces	1
an	1
army	1
corps.	1
This	1
silent	1
declaration	1
of	1
war	1
had	1
evidently	1
had	1
its	1
complete	1
effect.	1
As	1
MacIan	1
and	1
Turnbull	1
walked	1
steadily	1
but	1
slowly	1
towards	1
the	1
entrance	1
hall	1
of	1
the	1
institution,	1
they	1
could	1
see	1
that	1
most,	1
or	1
at	1
least	1
many,	1
of	1
the	1
patients	1
had	1
already	1
gathered	1
there	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
staff	1
of	1
doctors	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
regiment	1
of	1
keepers	1
and	1
assistants.	1
But	1
when	1
they	1
entered	1
the	1
lamp-lit	1
hall,	1
and	1
the	1
high	1
iron	1
door	1
was	1
clashed	1
to	1
and	1
locked	1
behind	1
them,	1
yet	1
a	1
new	1
amazement	1
leapt	1
into	1
their	1
eyes,	1
and	1
the	1
stalwart	1
Turnbull	1
almost	1
fell.	1
For	1
he	1
saw	1
a	1
sight	1
which	1
was	1
indeed,	1
as	1
MacIan	1
had	1
said--either	1
the	1
Day	1
of	1
Judgement	1
or	1
a	1
dream.	1
Within	1
a	1
few	1
feet	1
of	1
him	1
at	1
one	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
square	1
of	1
standing	1
people	1
stood	1
the	1
girl	1
he	1
had	1
known	1
in	1
Jersey,	1
Madeleine	1
Durand.	1
She	1
looked	1
straight	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
steady	1
smile	1
which	1
lit	1
up	1
the	1
scene	1
of	1
darkness	1
and	1
unreason	1
like	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
some	1
honest	1
fireside.	1
Her	1
square	1
face	1
and	1
throat	1
were	1
thrown	1
back,	1
as	1
her	1
habit	1
was,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
almost	1
sleepy	1
in	1
the	1
geniality	1
of	1
her	1
eyes.	1
He	1
saw	1
her	1
first,	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
seconds	1
saw	1
her	1
only;	1
then	1
the	1
outer	1
edge	1
of	1
his	1
eyesight	1
took	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
other	1
staring	1
faces,	1
and	1
he	1
saw	1
all	1
the	1
faces	1
he	1
had	1
ever	1
seen	1
for	1
weeks	1
and	1
months	1
past.	1
There	1
was	1
the	1
Tolstoyan	1
in	1
Jaeger	1
flannel,	1
with	1
the	1
yellow	1
beard	1
that	1
went	1
backward	1
and	1
the	1
foolish	1
nose	1
and	1
eyes	1
that	1
went	1
forward,	1
with	1
the	1
curiosity	1
of	1
a	1
crank.	1
He	1
was	1
talking	1
eagerly	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Gordon,	1
the	1
corpulent	1
Jew	1
shopkeeper	1
whom	1
they	1
had	1
once	1
gagged	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
shop.	1
There	1
was	1
the	1
tipsy	1
old	1
Hertfordshire	1
rustic;	1
he	1
was	1
talking	1
energetically	1
to	1
himself.	1
There	1
was	1
not	1
only	1
Mr.	1
Vane	1
the	1
magistrate,	1
but	1
the	1
clerk	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Vane,	1
the	1
magistrate.	1
There	1
was	1
not	1
only	1
Miss	1
Drake	1
of	1
the	1
motor-car,	1
but	1
also	1
Miss	1
Drake's	1
chauffeur.	1
Nothing	1
wild	1
or	1
unfamiliar	1
could	1
have	1
produced	1
upon	1
Turnbull	1
such	1
a	1
nightmare	1
impression	1
as	1
that	1
ring	1
of	1
familiar	1
faces.	1
Yet	1
he	1
had	1
one	1
intellectual	1
shock	1
which	1
was	1
greater	1
than	1
all	1
the	1
others.	1
He	1
stepped	1
impulsively	1
forward	1
towards	1
Madeleine,	1
and	1
then	1
wavered	1
with	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
wild	1
humility.	1
As	1
he	1
did	1
so	1
he	1
caught	1
sight	1
of	1
another	1
square	1
face	1
behind	1
Madeleine's,	1
a	1
face	1
with	1
long	1
grey	1
whiskers	1
and	1
an	1
austere	1
stare.	1
It	1
was	1
old	1
Durand,	1
the	1
girls'	1
father;	1
and	1
when	1
Turnbull	1
saw	1
him	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
last	1
and	1
worst	1
marvel	1
of	1
that	1
monstrous	1
night.	1
He	1
remembered	1
Durand;	1
he	1
remembered	1
his	1
monotonous,	1
everlasting	1
lucidity,	1
his	1
stupefyingly	1
sensible	1
views	1
of	1
everything,	1
his	1
colossal	1
contentment	1
with	1
truisms	1
merely	1
because	1
they	1
were	1
true.	1
"Confound	1
it	1
all!"	1
cried	1
Turnbull	1
to	1
himself,	1
"if	1
_he_	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
asylum,	1
there	1
can't	1
be	1
anyone	1
outside."	1
He	1
drew	1
nearer	1
to	1
Madeleine,	1
but	1
still	1
doubtfully	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
more	1
so	1
because	1
she	1
still	1
smiled	1
at	1
him.	1
MacIan	1
had	1
already	1
gone	1
across	1
to	1
Beatrice	1
with	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
fright.	1
Then	1
all	1
these	1
bewildered	1
but	1
partly	1
amicable	1
recognitions	1
were	1
cloven	1
by	1
a	1
cruel	1
voice	1
which	1
always	1
made	1
all	1
human	1
blood	1
turn	1
bitter.	1
The	1
Master	1
was	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
surveying	1
the	1
scene	1
like	1
a	1
great	1
artist	1
looking	1
at	1
a	1
completed	1
picture.	1
Handsome	1
as	1
he	1
looked,	1
they	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
so	1
clearly	1
what	1
was	1
really	1
hateful	1
in	1
his	1
face;	1
and	1
even	1
then	1
they	1
could	1
only	1
express	1
it	1
by	1
saying	1
that	1
the	1
arched	1
brows	1
and	1
the	1
long	1
emphatic	1
chin	1
gave	1
it	1
always	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
being	1
lit	1
from	1
below,	1
like	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
some	1
infernal	1
actor.	1
"This	1
is	1
indeed	1
a	1
cosy	1
party,"	1
he	1
said,	1
with	1
glittering	1
eyes.	1
The	1
Master	1
evidently	1
meant	1
to	1
say	1
more,	1
but	1
before	1
he	1
could	1
say	1
anything	1
M.	1
Durand	1
had	1
stepped	1
right	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
was	1
speaking.	1
He	1
was	1
speaking	1
exactly	1
as	1
a	1
French	1
bourgeois	1
speaks	1
to	1
the	1
manager	1
of	1
a	1
restaurant.	1
That	1
is,	1
he	1
spoke	1
with	1
rattling	1
and	1
breathless	1
rapidity,	1
but	1
with	1
no	1
incoherence,	1
and	1
therefore	1
with	1
no	1
emotion.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
steady,	1
monotonous	1
vivacity,	1
which	1
came	1
not	1
seemingly	1
from	1
passion,	1
but	1
merely	1
from	1
the	1
reason	1
having	1
been	1
sent	1
off	1
at	1
a	1
gallop.	1
He	1
was	1
saying	1
something	1
like	1
this:	1
"You	1
refuse	1
me	1
my	1
half-bottle	1
of	1
Medoc,	1
the	1
drink	1
the	1
most	1
wholesome	1
and	1
the	1
most	1
customary.	1
You	1
refuse	1
me	1
the	1
company	1
and	1
obedience	1
of	1
my	1
daughter,	1
which	1
Nature	1
herself	1
indicates.	1
You	1
refuse	1
me	1
the	1
beef	1
and	1
mutton,	1
without	1
pretence	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
fast	1
of	1
the	1
Church.	1
You	1
now	1
forbid	1
me	1
the	1
promenade,	1
a	1
thing	1
necessary	1
to	1
a	1
person	1
of	1
my	1
age.	1
It	1
is	1
useless	1
to	1
tell	1
me	1
that	1
you	1
do	1
all	1
this	1
by	1
law.	1
Law	1
rests	1
upon	1
the	1
social	1
contract.	1
If	1
the	1
citizen	1
finds	1
himself	1
despoiled	1
of	1
such	1
pleasures	1
and	1
powers	1
as	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
had	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
savage	1
state,	1
the	1
social	1
contract	1
is	1
annulled."	1
"It's	1
no	1
good	1
chattering	1
away,	1
Monsieur,"	1
said	1
Hutton,	1
for	1
the	1
Master	1
was	1
silent.	1
"The	1
place	1
is	1
covered	1
with	1
machine-guns.	1
We've	1
got	1
to	1
obey	1
our	1
orders,	1
and	1
so	1
have	1
you."	1
"The	1
machinery	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
perfect,"	1
assented	1
Durand,	1
somewhat	1
irrelevantly;	1
"worked	1
by	1
petroleum,	1
I	1
believe.	1
I	1
only	1
ask	1
you	1
to	1
admit	1
that	1
if	1
such	1
things	1
fall	1
below	1
the	1
comfort	1
of	1
barbarism,	1
the	1
social	1
contract	1
is	1
annulled.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
pretty	1
little	1
point	1
of	1
theory."	1
"Oh!	1
I	1
dare	1
say,"	1
said	1
Hutton.	1
Durand	1
bowed	1
quite	1
civilly	1
and	1
withdrew.	1
"A	1
cosy	1
party,"	1
resumed	1
the	1
Master,	1
scornfully,	1
"and	1
yet	1
I	1
believe	1
some	1
of	1
you	1
are	1
in	1
doubt	1
about	1
how	1
we	1
all	1
came	1
together.	1
I	1
will	1
explain	1
it,	1
ladies	1
and	1
gentlemen;	1
I	1
will	1
explain	1
everything.	1
To	1
whom	1
shall	1
I	1
specially	1
address	1
myself?	1
To	1
Mr.	1
James	1
Turnbull.	1
He	1
has	1
a	1
scientific	1
mind."	1
Turnbull	1
seemed	1
to	1
choke	1
with	1
sudden	1
protest.	1
The	1
Master	1
seemed	1
only	1
to	1
cough	1
out	1
of	1
pure	1
politeness	1
and	1
proceeded:	1
"Mr.	1
Turnbull	1
will	1
agree	1
with	1
me,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"when	1
I	1
say	1
that	1
we	1
long	1
felt	1
in	1
scientific	1
circles	1
that	1
great	1
harm	1
was	1
done	1
by	1
such	1
a	1
legend	1
as	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
Crucifixion."	1
Turnbull	1
growled	1
something	1
which	1
was	1
presumably	1
assent.	1
The	1
Master	1
went	1
on	1
smoothly:	1
"It	1
was	1
in	1
vain	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
urge	1
that	1
the	1
incident	1
was	1
irrelevant;	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
such	1
fanatics,	1
many	1
such	1
executions.	1
We	1
were	1
forced	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
thing	1
thoroughly	1
in	1
hand,	1
to	1
investigate	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
scientific	1
history,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
assistance	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Turnbull	1
and	1
others	1
we	1
were	1
happy	1
in	1
being	1
able	1
to	1
announce	1
that	1
this	1
alleged	1
Crucifixion	1
never	1
occurred	1
at	1
all."	1
MacIan	1
lifted	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
Master	1
steadily,	1
but	1
Turnbull	1
did	1
not	1
look	1
up.	1
"This,	1
we	1
found,	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
way	1
with	1
all	1
superstitions,"	1
continued	1
the	1
speaker;	1
"it	1
was	1
necessary	1
to	1
deny	1
them	1
historically,	1
and	1
we	1
have	1
done	1
it	1
with	1
great	1
success	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
miracles	1
and	1
such	1
things.	1
Now	1
within	1
our	1
own	1
time	1
there	1
arose	1
an	1
unfortunate	1
fuss	1
which	1
threatened	1
(as	1
Mr.	1
Turnbull	1
would	1
say)	1
to	1
galvanize	1
the	1
corpse	1
of	1
Christianity	1
into	1
a	1
fictitious	1
life--the	1
alleged	1
case	1
of	1
a	1
Highland	1
eccentric	1
who	1
wanted	1
to	1
fight	1
for	1
the	1
Virgin."	1
MacIan,	1
quite	1
white,	1
made	1
a	1
step	1
forward,	1
but	1
the	1
speaker	1
did	1
not	1
alter	1
his	1
easy	1
attitude	1
or	1
his	1
flow	1
of	1
words.	1
"Again	1
we	1
urged	1
that	1
this	1
duel	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
admired,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
mere	1
brawl,	1
but	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
ignorant	1
and	1
romantic.	1
There	1
were	1
signs	1
of	1
treating	1
this	1
alleged	1
Highlander	1
and	1
his	1
alleged	1
opponent	1
as	1
heroes.	1
We	1
tried	1
all	1
other	1
means	1
of	1
arresting	1
this	1
reactionary	1
hero	1
worship.	1
Working	1
men	1
who	1
betted	1
on	1
the	1
duel	1
were	1
imprisoned	1
for	1
gambling.	1
Working	1
men	1
who	1
drank	1
the	1
health	1
of	1
a	1
duellist	1
were	1
imprisoned	1
for	1
drunkenness.	1
But	1
the	1
popular	1
excitement	1
about	1
the	1
alleged	1
duel	1
continued,	1
and	1
we	1
had	1
to	1
fall	1
back	1
on	1
our	1
old	1
historical	1
method.	1
We	1
investigated,	1
on	1
scientific	1
principles,	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
MacIan's	1
challenge,	1
and	1
we	1
are	1
happy	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
inform	1
you	1
that	1
the	1
whole	1
story	1
of	1
the	1
attempted	1
duel	1
is	1
a	1
fable.	1
There	1
never	1
was	1
any	1
challenge.	1
There	1
never	1
was	1
any	1
man	1
named	1
MacIan.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
melodramatic	1
myth,	1
like	1
Calvary."	1
Not	1
a	1
soul	1
moved	1
save	1
Turnbull,	1
who	1
lifted	1
his	1
head;	1
yet	1
there	1
was	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
a	1
silent	1
explosion.	1
"The	1
whole	1
story	1
of	1
the	1
MacIan	1
challenge,"	1
went	1
on	1
the	1
Master,	1
beaming	1
at	1
them	1
all	1
with	1
a	1
sinister	1
benignity,	1
"has	1
been	1
found	1
to	1
originate	1
in	1
the	1
obsessions	1
of	1
a	1
few	1
pathological	1
types,	1
who	1
are	1
now	1
all	1
fortunately	1
in	1
our	1
care.	1
There	1
is,	1
for	1
instance,	1
a	1
person	1
here	1
of	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Gordon,	1
formerly	1
the	1
keeper	1
of	1
a	1
curiosity	1
shop.	1
He	1
is	1
a	1
victim	1
of	1
the	1
disease	1
called	1
Vinculomania--the	1
impression	1
that	1
one	1
has	1
been	1
bound	1
or	1
tied	1
up.	1
We	1
have	1
also	1
a	1
case	1
of	1
Fugacity	1
(Mr.	1
Whimpey),	1
who	1
imagines	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
chased	1
by	1
two	1
men."	1
The	1
indignant	1
faces	1
of	1
the	1
Jew	1
shopkeeper	1
and	1
the	1
Magdalen	1
Don	1
started	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
crowd	1
in	1
their	1
indignation,	1
but	1
the	1
speaker	1
continued:	1
"One	1
poor	1
woman	1
we	1
have	1
with	1
us,"	1
he	1
said,	1
in	1
a	1
compassionate	1
voice,	1
"believes	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
motor-car	1
with	1
two	1
such	1
men;	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
well-known	1
illusion	1
of	1
speed	1
on	1
which	1
I	1
need	1
not	1
dwell.	1
Another	1
wretched	1
woman	1
has	1
the	1
simple	1
egotistic	1
mania	1
that	1
she	1
has	1
caused	1
the	1
duel.	1
Madeleine	1
Durand	1
actually	1
professes	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
the	1
fight	1
between	1
MacIan	1
and	1
his	1
enemy,	1
a	1
fight	1
which,	1
if	1
it	1
occurred	1
at	1
all,	1
certainly	1
began	1
long	1
before.	1
But	1
it	1
never	1
occurred	1
at	1
all.	1
We	1
have	1
taken	1
in	1
hand	1
every	1
person	1
who	1
professed	1
to	1
have	1
seen	1
such	1
a	1
thing,	1
and	1
proved	1
them	1
all	1
to	1
be	1
unbalanced.	1
That	1
is	1
why	1
they	1
are	1
here."	1
The	1
Master	1
looked	1
round	1
the	1
room,	1
just	1
showing	1
his	1
perfect	1
teeth	1
with	1
the	1
perfection	1
of	1
artistic	1
cruelty,	1
exalted	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
in	1
the	1
enormous	1
simplicity	1
of	1
his	1
success,	1
and	1
then	1
walked	1
across	1
the	1
hall	1
and	1
vanished	1
through	1
an	1
inner	1
door.	1
His	1
two	1
lieutenants,	1
Quayle	1
and	1
Hutton,	1
were	1
left	1
standing	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
army	1
of	1
servants	1
and	1
keepers.	1
"I	1
hope	1
we	1
shall	1
have	1
no	1
more	1
trouble,"	1
said	1
Dr.	1
Quayle	1
pleasantly	1
enough,	1
and	1
addressing	1
Turnbull,	1
who	1
was	1
leaning	1
heavily	1
upon	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
a	1
chair.	1
Still	1
looking	1
down,	1
Turnbull	1
lifted	1
the	1
chair	1
an	1
inch	1
or	1
two	1
from	1
the	1
ground.	1
Then	1
he	1
suddenly	1
swung	1
it	1
above	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
sent	1
it	1
at	1
the	1
inquiring	1
doctor	1
with	1
an	1
awful	1
crash	1
which	1
sent	1
one	1
of	1
its	1
wooden	1
legs	1
loose	1
along	1
the	1
floor	1
and	1
crammed	1
the	1
doctor	1
gasping	1
into	1
a	1
corner.	1
MacIan	1
gave	1
a	1
great	1
shout,	1
snatched	1
up	1
the	1
loose	1
chair-leg,	1
and,	1
rushing	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
doctor,	1
felled	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
blow.	1
Twenty	1
attendants	1
rushed	1
to	1
capture	1
the	1
rebels;	1
MacIan	1
flung	1
back	1
three	1
of	1
them	1
and	1
Turnbull	1
went	1
over	1
on	1
top	1
of	1
one,	1
when	1
from	1
behind	1
them	1
all	1
came	1
a	1
shriek	1
as	1
of	1
something	1
quite	1
fresh	1
and	1
frightful.	1
Two	1
of	1
the	1
three	1
passages	1
leading	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hall	1
were	1
choked	1
with	1
blue	1
smoke.	1
Another	1
instant	1
and	1
the	1
hall	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
fog	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
red	1
sparks	1
began	1
to	1
swarm	1
like	1
scarlet	1
bees.	1
"The	1
place	1
is	1
on	1
fire!"	1
cried	1
Quayle	1
with	1
a	1
scream	1
of	1
indecent	1
terror.	1
"Oh,	1
who	1
can	1
have	1
done	1
it?	1
How	1
can	1
it	1
have	1
happened?"	1
A	1
light	1
had	1
come	1
into	1
Turnbull's	1
eyes.	1
"How	1
did	1
the	1
French	1
Revolution	1
happen?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
"Oh,	1
how	1
should	1
I	1
know!"	1
wailed	1
the	1
other.	1
"Then	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
you,"	1
said	1
Turnbull;	1
"it	1
happened	1
because	1
some	1
people	1
fancied	1
that	1
a	1
French	1
grocer	1
was	1
as	1
respectable	1
as	1
he	1
looked."	1
Even	1
as	1
he	1
spoke,	1
as	1
if	1
by	1
confirmation,	1
old	1
Mr.	1
Durand	1
re-entered	1
the	1
smoky	1
room	1
quite	1
placidly,	1
wiping	1
the	1
petroleum	1
from	1
his	1
hands	1
with	1
a	1
handkerchief.	1
He	1
had	1
set	1
fire	1
to	1
the	1
building	1
in	1
accordance	1
with	1
the	1
strict	1
principles	1
of	1
the	1
social	1
contract.	1
But	1
MacIan	1
had	1
taken	1
a	1
stride	1
forward	1
and	1
stood	1
there	1
shaken	1
and	1
terrible.	1
"Now,"	1
he	1
cried,	1
panting,	1
"now	1
is	1
the	1
judgement	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
The	1
doctors	1
will	1
leave	1
this	1
place;	1
the	1
keepers	1
will	1
leave	1
this	1
place.	1
They	1
will	1
leave	1
us	1
in	1
charge	1
of	1
the	1
machinery	1
and	1
the	1
machine-guns	1
at	1
the	1
windows.	1
But	1
we,	1
the	1
lunatics,	1
will	1
wait	1
to	1
be	1
burned	1
alive	1
if	1
only	1
we	1
may	1
see	1
them	1
go."	1
"How	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
we	1
shall	1
go?"	1
asked	1
Hutton,	1
fiercely.	1
"You	1
believe	1
nothing,"	1
said	1
MacIan,	1
simply,	1
"and	1
you	1
are	1
insupportably	1
afraid	1
of	1
death."	1
"So	1
this	1
is	1
suicide,"	1
sneered	1
the	1
doctor;	1
"a	1
somewhat	1
doubtful	1
sign	1
of	1
sanity."	1
"Not	1
at	1
all--this	1
is	1
vengeance,"	1
answered	1
Turnbull,	1
quite	1
calmly;	1
"a	1
thing	1
which	1
is	1
completely	1
healthy."	1
"You	1
think	1
the	1
doctors	1
will	1
go,"	1
said	1
Hutton,	1
savagely.	1
"The	1
keepers	1
have	1
gone	1
already,"	1
said	1
Turnbull.	1
Even	1
as	1
they	1
spoke	1
the	1
main	1
doors	1
were	1
burst	1
open	1
in	1
mere	1
brutal	1
panic,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
officers	1
and	1
subordinates	1
of	1
the	1
asylum	1
rushed	1
away	1
across	1
the	1
garden	1
pursued	1
by	1
the	1
smoke.	1
But	1
among	1
the	1
ticketed	1
maniacs	1
not	1
a	1
man	1
or	1
woman	1
moved.	1
"We	1
hate	1
dying,"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
with	1
composure,	1
"but	1
we	1
hate	1
you	1
even	1
more.	1
This	1
is	1
a	1
successful	1
revolution."	1
In	1
the	1
roof	1
above	1
their	1
heads	1
a	1
panel	1
shot	1
back,	1
showing	1
a	1
strip	1
of	1
star-lit	1
sky	1
and	1
a	1
huge	1
thing	1
made	1
of	1
white	1
metal,	1
with	1
the	1
shape	1
and	1
fins	1
of	1
a	1
fish,	1
swinging	1
as	1
if	1
at	1
anchor.	1
At	1
the	1
same	1
moment	1
a	1
steel	1
ladder	1
slid	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
opening	1
and	1
struck	1
the	1
floor,	1
and	1
the	1
cleft	1
chin	1
of	1
the	1
mysterious	1
Master	1
was	1
thrust	1
into	1
the	1
opening.	1
"Quayle,	1
Hutton,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"you	1
will	1
escape	1
with	1
me."	1
And	1
they	1
went	1
up	1
the	1
ladder	1
like	1
automata	1
of	1
lead.	1
Long	1
after	1
they	1
had	1
clambered	1
into	1
the	1
car,	1
the	1
creature	1
with	1
the	1
cloven	1
face	1
continued	1
to	1
leer	1
down	1
upon	1
the	1
smoke-stung	1
crowd	1
below.	1
Then	1
at	1
last	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
silken	1
voice	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
of	1
final	1
satisfaction:	1
"By	1
the	1
way,	1
I	1
fear	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
absent	1
minded.	1
There	1
is	1
one	1
man	1
specially	1
whom,	1
somehow,	1
I	1
always	1
forget.	1
I	1
always	1
leave	1
him	1
lying	1
about.	1
Once	1
I	1
mislaid	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
Cross	1
of	1
St.	1
Paul's.	1
So	1
silly	1
of	1
me;	1
and	1
now	1
I've	1
forgotten	1
him	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
little	1
cells	1
where	1
your	1
fire	1
is	1
burning.	1
Very	1
unfortunate--especially	1
for	1
him."	1
And	1
nodding	1
genially,	1
he	1
climbed	1
into	1
his	1
flying	1
ship.	1
MacIan	1
stood	1
motionless	1
for	1
two	1
minutes,	1
and	1
then	1
rushed	1
down	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
suffocating	1
corridors	1
till	1
he	1
found	1
the	1
flames.	1
Turnbull	1
looked	1
once	1
at	1
Madeleine,	1
and	1
followed.	1
*	1
*	1
*	1
MacIan,	1
with	1
singed	1
hair,	1
smoking	1
garments,	1
and	1
smarting	1
hands	1
and	1
face,	1
had	1
already	1
broken	1
far	1
enough	1
through	1
the	1
first	1
barriers	1
of	1
burning	1
timber	1
to	1
come	1
within	1
cry	1
of	1
the	1
cells	1
he	1
had	1
once	1
known.	1
It	1
was	1
impossible,	1
however,	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
spot	1
where	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
lay	1
dead	1
or	1
alive;	1
not	1
now	1
through	1
darkness,	1
but	1
through	1
scorching	1
and	1
aching	1
light.	1
The	1
site	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
half-wit's	1
cell	1
was	1
now	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
a	1
standing	1
forest	1
of	1
fire--the	1
flames	1
as	1
thick	1
and	1
yellow	1
as	1
a	1
cornfield.	1
Their	1
incessant	1
shrieking	1
and	1
crackling	1
was	1
like	1
a	1
mob	1
shouting	1
against	1
an	1
orator.	1
Yet	1
through	1
all	1
that	1
deafening	1
density	1
MacIan	1
thought	1
he	1
heard	1
a	1
small	1
and	1
separate	1
sound.	1
When	1
he	1
heard	1
it	1
he	1
rushed	1
forward	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
plunge	1
into	1
that	1
furnace,	1
but	1
Turnbull	1
arrested	1
him	1
by	1
an	1
elbow.	1
"Let	1
me	1
go!"	1
cried	1
Evan,	1
in	1
agony;	1
"it's	1
the	1
poor	1
old	1
beggar's	1
voice--he's	1
still	1
alive,	1
and	1
shouting	1
for	1
help."	1
"Listen!"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
and	1
lifted	1
one	1
finger	1
from	1
his	1
clenched	1
hand.	1
"Or	1
else	1
he	1
is	1
shrieking	1
with	1
pain,"	1
protested	1
MacIan.	1
"I	1
will	1
not	1
endure	1
it."	1
"Listen!"	1
repeated	1
Turnbull,	1
grimly.	1
"Did	1
you	1
ever	1
hear	1
anyone	1
shout	1
for	1
help	1
or	1
shriek	1
with	1
pain	1
in	1
that	1
voice?"	1
The	1
small	1
shrill	1
sounds	1
which	1
came	1
through	1
the	1
crash	1
of	1
the	1
conflagration	1
were	1
indeed	1
of	1
an	1
odd	1
sort,	1
and	1
MacIan	1
turned	1
a	1
face	1
of	1
puzzled	1
inquiry	1
to	1
his	1
companion.	1
"He	1
is	1
singing,"	1
said	1
Turnbull,	1
simply.	1
A	1
remaining	1
rampart	1
fell,	1
crushing	1
the	1
fire,	1
and	1
through	1
the	1
diminished	1
din	1
of	1
it	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
old	1
lunatic	1
came	1
clearer.	1
In	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
that	1
white-hot	1
hell	1
he	1
was	1
singing	1
like	1
a	1
bird.	1
What	1
he	1
was	1
singing	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
very	1
easy	1
to	1
follow,	1
but	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
something	1
about	1
playing	1
in	1
the	1
golden	1
hay.	1
"Good	1
Lord!"	1
cried	1
Turnbull,	1
bitterly,	1
"there	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
some	1
advantages	1
in	1
really	1
being	1
an	1
idiot."	1
Then	1
advancing	1
to	1
the	1
fringe	1
of	1
the	1
fire	1
he	1
called	1
out	1
on	1
chance	1
to	1
the	1
invisible	1
singer:	1
"Can	1
you	1
come	1
out?	1
Are	1
you	1
cut	1
off?"	1
"God	1
help	1
us	1
all!"	1
said	1
MacIan,	1
with	1
a	1
shudder;	1
"he's	1
laughing	1
now."	1
At	1
whatever	1
stage	1
of	1
being	1
burned	1
alive	1
the	1
invisible	1
now	1
found	1
himself,	1
he	1
was	1
now	1
shaking	1
out	1
peals	1
of	1
silvery	1
and	1
hilarious	1
laughter.	1
As	1
he	1
listened,	1
MacIan's	1
two	1
eyes	1
began	1
to	1
glow,	1
as	1
if	1
a	1
strange	1
thought	1
had	1
come	1
into	1
his	1
head.	1
"Fool,	1
come	1
out	1
and	1
save	1
yourself!"	1
shouted	1
Turnbull.	1
"No,	1
by	1
Heaven!	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
way,"	1
cried	1
Evan,	1
suddenly.	1
"Father,"	1
he	1
shouted,	1
"come	1
out	1
and	1
save	1
us	1
all!"	1
The	1
fire,	1
though	1
it	1
had	1
dropped	1
in	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
places,	1
was,	1
upon	1
the	1
whole,	1
higher	1
and	1
more	1
unconquerable	1
than	1
ever.	1
Separate	1
tall	1
flames	1
shot	1
up	1
and	1
spread	1
out	1
above	1
them	1
like	1
the	1
fiery	1
cloisters	1
of	1
some	1
infernal	1
cathedral,	1
or	1
like	1
a	1
grove	1
of	1
red	1
tropical	1
trees	1
in	1
the	1
garden	1
of	1
the	1
devil.	1
Higher	1
yet	1
in	1
the	1
purple	1
hollow	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
the	1
topmost	1
flames	1
leapt	1
again	1
and	1
again	1
fruitlessly	1
at	1
the	1
stars,	1
like	1
golden	1
dragons	1
chained	1
but	1
struggling.	1
The	1
towers	1
and	1
domes	1
of	1
the	1
oppressive	1
smoke	1
seemed	1
high	1
and	1
far	1
enough	1
to	1
drown	1
distant	1
planets	1
in	1
a	1
London	1
fog.	1
But	1
if	1
we	1
exhausted	1
all	1
frantic	1
similes	1
for	1
that	1
frantic	1
scene,	1
the	1
main	1
impression	1
about	1
the	1
fire	1
would	1
still	1
be	1
its	1
ranked	1
upstanding	1
rigidity	1
and	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
roaring	1
stillness.	1
It	1
was	1
literally	1
a	1
wall	1
of	1
fire.	1
"Father,"	1
cried	1
MacIan,	1
once	1
more,	1
"come	1
out	1
of	1
it	1
and	1
save	1
us	1
all!"	1
Turnbull	1
was	1
staring	1
at	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
cried.	1
The	1
tall	1
and	1
steady	1
forest	1
of	1
fire	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
already	1
a	1
portent	1
visible	1
to	1
the	1
whole	1
circle	1
of	1
land	1
and	1
sea.	1
The	1
red	1
flush	1
of	1
it	1
lit	1
up	1
the	1
long	1
sides	1
of	1
white	1
ships	1
far	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
German	1
Ocean,	1
and	1
picked	1
out	1
like	1
piercing	1
rubies	1
the	1
windows	1
in	1
the	1
villages	1
on	1
the	1
distant	1
heights.	1
If	1
any	1
villagers	1
or	1
sailors	1
were	1
looking	1
towards	1
it	1
they	1
must	1
have	1
seen	1
a	1
strange	1
sight	1
as	1
MacIan	1
cried	1
out	1
for	1
the	1
third	1
time.	1
That	1
forest	1
of	1
fire	1
wavered,	1
and	1
was	1
cloven	1
in	1
the	1
centre;	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
one	1
half	1
of	1
it	1
leaned	1
one	1
way	1
as	1
a	1
cornfield	1
leans	1
all	1
one	1
way	1
under	1
the	1
load	1
of	1
the	1
wind.	1
Indeed,	1
it	1
looked	1
as	1
if	1
a	1
great	1
wind	1
had	1
sprung	1
up	1
and	1
driven	1
the	1
great	1
fire	1
aslant.	1
Its	1
smoke	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
sent	1
up	1
to	1
choke	1
the	1
stars,	1
but	1
was	1
trailed	1
and	1
dragged	1
across	1
county	1
after	1
county	1
like	1
one	1
dreadful	1
banner	1
of	1
defeat.	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
wind;	1
or,	1
if	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
wind,	1
it	1
was	1
two	1
winds	1
blowing	1
in	1
opposite	1
directions.	1
For	1
while	1
one	1
half	1
of	1
the	1
huge	1
fire	1
sloped	1
one	1
way	1
towards	1
the	1
inland	1
heights,	1
the	1
other	1
half,	1
at	1
exactly	1
the	1
same	1
angle,	1
sloped	1
out	1
eastward	1
towards	1
the	1
sea.	1
So	1
that	1
earth	1
and	1
ocean	1
could	1
behold,	1
where	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
mere	1
fiery	1
mass,	1
a	1
thing	1
divided	1
like	1
a	1
V--a	1
cloven	1
tongue	1
of	1
flame.	1
But	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
prodigy	1
for	1
those	1
distant,	1
it	1
was	1
something	1
beyond	1
speech	1
for	1
those	1
quite	1
near.	1
As	1
the	1
echoes	1
of	1
Evan's	1
last	1
appeal	1
rang	1
and	1
died	1
in	1
the	1
universal	1
uproar,	1
the	1
fiery	1
vault	1
over	1
his	1
head	1
opened	1
down	1
the	1
middle,	1
and,	1
reeling	1
back	1
in	1
two	1
great	1
golden	1
billows,	1
hung	1
on	1
each	1
side	1
as	1
huge	1
and	1
harmless	1
as	1
two	1
sloping	1
hills	1
lie	1
on	1
each	1
side	1
of	1
a	1
valley.	1
Down	1
the	1
centre	1
of	1
this	1
trough,	1
or	1
chasm,	1
a	1
little	1
path	1
ran,	1
cleared	1
of	1
all	1
but	1
ashes,	1
and	1
down	1
this	1
little	1
path	1
was	1
walking	1
a	1
little	1
old	1
man	1
singing	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
alone	1
in	1
a	1
wood	1
in	1
spring.	1
When	1
James	1
Turnbull	1
saw	1
this	1
he	1
suddenly	1
put	1
out	1
a	1
hand	1
and	1
seemed	1
to	1
support	1
himself	1
on	1
the	1
strong	1
shoulder	1
of	1
Madeleine	1
Durand.	1
Then	1
after	1
a	1
moment's	1
hesitation	1
he	1
put	1
his	1
other	1
hand	1
on	1
the	1
shoulder	1
of	1
MacIan.	1
His	1
blue	1
eyes	1
looked	1
extraordinarily	1
brilliant	1
and	1
beautiful.	1
In	1
many	1
sceptical	1
papers	1
and	1
magazines	1
afterwards	1
he	1
was	1
sadly	1
or	1
sternly	1
rebuked	1
for	1
having	1
abandoned	1
the	1
certainties	1
of	1
materialism.	1
All	1
his	1
life	1
up	1
to	1
that	1
moment	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
most	1
honestly	1
certain	1
that	1
materialism	1
was	1
a	1
fact.	1
But	1
he	1
was	1
unlike	1
the	1
writers	1
in	1
the	1
magazines	1
precisely	1
in	1
this--	1
that	1
he	1
preferred	1
a	1
fact	1
even	1
to	1
materialism.	1
As	1
the	1
little	1
singing	1
figure	1
came	1
nearer	1
and	1
nearer,	1
Evan	1
fell	1
on	1
his	1
knees,	1
and	1
after	1
an	1
instant	1
Beatrice	1
followed;	1
then	1
Madeleine	1
fell	1
on	1
her	1
knees,	1
and	1
after	1
a	1
longer	1
instant	1
Turnbull	1
followed.	1
Then	1
the	1
little	1
old	1
man	1
went	1
past	1
them	1
singing	1
down	1
that	1
corridor	1
of	1
flames.	1
They	1
had	1
not	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
face.	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
passed	1
they	1
looked	1
up.	1
While	1
the	1
first	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
fire	1
had	1
shot	1
east	1
and	1
west,	1
painting	1
the	1
sides	1
of	1
ships	1
with	1
fire-light	1
or	1
striking	1
red	1
sparks	1
out	1
of	1
windowed	1
houses,	1
it	1
had	1
not	1
hitherto	1
struck	1
upward,	1
for	1
there	1
was	1
above	1
it	1
the	1
ponderous	1
and	1
rococo	1
cavern	1
of	1
its	1
own	1
monstrous	1
coloured	1
smoke.	1
But	1
now	1
the	1
fire	1
was	1
turned	1
to	1
left	1
and	1
right	1
like	1
a	1
woman's	1
hair	1
parted	1
in	1
the	1
middle,	1
and	1
now	1
the	1
shafts	1
of	1
its	1
light	1
could	1
shoot	1
up	1
into	1
empty	1
heavens	1
and	1
strike	1
anything,	1
either	1
bird	1
or	1
cloud.	1
But	1
it	1
struck	1
something	1
that	1
was	1
neither	1
cloud	1
nor	1
bird.	1
Far,	1
far	1
away	1
up	1
in	1
those	1
huge	1
hollows	1
of	1
space	1
something	1
was	1
flying	1
swiftly	1
and	1
shining	1
brightly,	1
something	1
that	1
shone	1
too	1
bright	1
and	1
flew	1
too	1
fast	1
to	1
be	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
fowls	1
of	1
the	1
air,	1
though	1
the	1
red	1
light	1
lit	1
it	1
from	1
underneath	1
like	1
the	1
breast	1
of	1
a	1
bird.	1
Everyone	1
knew	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
flying	1
ship,	1
and	1
everyone	1
knew	1
whose.	1
As	1
they	1
stared	1
upward	1
the	1
little	1
speck	1
of	1
light	1
seemed	1
slightly	1
tilted,	1
and	1
two	1
black	1
dots	1
dropped	1
from	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
it.	1
All	1
the	1
eager,	1
upturned	1
faces	1
watched	1
the	1
two	1
dots	1
as	1
they	1
grew	1
bigger	1
and	1
bigger	1
in	1
their	1
downward	1
rush.	1
Then	1
someone	1
screamed,	1
and	1
no	1
one	1
looked	1
up	1
any	1
more.	1
For	1
the	1
two	1
bodies,	1
larger	1
every	1
second	1
flying,	1
spread	1
out	1
and	1
sprawling	1
in	1
the	1
fire-light,	1
were	1
the	1
dead	1
bodies	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
doctors	1
whom	1
Professor	1
Lucifer	1
had	1
carried	1
with	1
him--the	1
weak	1
and	1
sneering	1
Quayle,	1
the	1
cold	1
and	1
clumsy	1
Hutton.	1
They	1
went	1
with	1
a	1
crash	1
into	1
the	1
thick	1
of	1
the	1
fire.	1
"They	1
are	1
gone!"	1
screamed	1
Beatrice,	1
hiding	1
her	1
head.	1
"O	1
God!	1
The	1
are	1
lost!"	1
Evan	1
put	1
his	1
arm	1
about	1
her,	1
and	1
remembered	1
his	1
own	1
vision.	1
"No,	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
lost,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"They	1
are	1
saved.	1
He	1
has	1
taken	1
away	1
no	1
souls	1
with	1
him,	1
after	1
all."	1
He	1
looked	1
vaguely	1
about	1
at	1
the	1
fire	1
that	1
was	1
already	1
fading,	1
and	1
there	1
among	1
the	1
ashes	1
lay	1
two	1
shining	1
things	1
that	1
had	1
survived	1
the	1
fire,	1
his	1
sword	1
and	1
Turnbull's,	1
fallen	1
haphazard	1
in	1
the	1
pattern	1
of	1
a	1
cross.	1

now,	1

these	1
are	1
the	1
only	1
ones	1
that	1
have	1
responded.	1
As	1
the	1

additions	1

will	1

Please	1
feel	1

to	1
ask	1
to	1

the	1

of	1
your	1

In	1
answer	1

we	1
have	1

We	1

to	1
know	1
if	1
we	1
have	1
added	1
it	1
since	1
the	1

you	1
have,	1
just	1
ask.	1
While	1
we	1

statement	1
here?	1
You	1
know:	1
lawyers.	1
They	1
tell	1
us	1
you	1
might	1
sue	1
us	1
if	1
there	1
is	1
something	1
wrong	1
with	1
your	1
copy	1
of	1
this	1

even	1
if	1
you	1
got	1
it	1
for	1

someone	1

than	1
us,	1
and	1
even	1
if	1
what's	1
wrong	1
is	1
not	1
our	1
fault.	1
So,	1
among	1
other	1
things,	1
this	1
"Small	1

disclaims	1
most	1
of	1
our	1
