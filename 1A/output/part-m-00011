TWO	1
LITTLE	1
RIDDLES	1
IN	1
RHYME	1
There's	1
a	1
garden	1
that	1
I	1
ken,	1
Full	1
of	1
little	1
gentlemen;	1
Little	1
caps	1
of	1
blue	1
they	1
wear,	1
And	1
green	1
ribbons,	1
very	1
fair.	1
(Flax.)	1
From	1
house	1
to	1
house	1
he	1
goes,	1
A	1
messenger	1
small	1
and	1
slight,	1
And	1
whether	1
it	1
rains	1
or	1
snows,	1
He	1
sleeps	1
outside	1
in	1
the	1
night.	1

path.)	1
THE	1
LITTLE	1
YELLOW	1
TULIP	1
Once	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
yellow	1
Tulip,	1
and	1
she	1
lived	1
down	1
in	1
a	1
little	1
dark	1
house	1
under	1
the	1
ground.	1
One	1
day	1
she	1
was	1
sitting	1
there,	1
all	1
by	1
herself,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
very	1
still.	1
Suddenly,	1
she	1
heard	1
a	1
little	1
_tap,	1
tap,	1
tap_,	1
at	1
the	1
door.	1
"Who	1
is	1
that?"	1
she	1
said.	1
"It's	1
the	1
Rain,	1
and	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
come	1
in,"	1
said	1
a	1
soft,	1
sad,	1
little	1
voice.	1
"No,	1
you	1
can't	1
come	1
in,"	1
the	1
little	1
Tulip	1
said.	1
By	1
and	1
by	1
she	1
heard	1
another	1
little	1
_tap,	1
tap,	1
tap_	1
on	1
the	1
window-pane.	1
"Who	1
is	1
there?"	1
she	1
said.	1
The	1
same	1
soft	1
little	1
voice	1
answered,	1
"It's	1
the	1
Rain,	1
and	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
come	1
in!"	1
"No,	1
you	1
can't	1
come	1
in,"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
Tulip.	1
Then	1
it	1
was	1
very	1
still	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time.	1
At	1
last,	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
little	1
rustling,	1
whispering	1
sound,	1
all	1
round	1
the	1
window:	1
_rustle,	1
whisper,	1
whisper_.	1
"Who	1
is	1
there?"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
Tulip.	1
"It's	1
the	1
Sunshine,"	1
said	1
a	1
little,	1
soft,	1
cheery	1
voice,	1
"and	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
come	1
in!"	1
"N--no,"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
Tulip,	1
"you	1
can't	1
come	1
in."	1
And	1
she	1
sat	1
still	1
again.	1
Pretty	1
soon	1
she	1
heard	1
the	1
sweet	1
little	1
rustling	1
noise	1
at	1
the	1
keyhole.	1
"Who	1
is	1
there?"	1
she	1
said.	1
"It's	1
the	1
Sunshine,"	1
said	1
the	1
cheery	1
little	1
voice,	1
"and	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
come	1
in,	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
come	1
in!"	1
"No,	1
no,"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
Tulip,	1
"you	1
cannot	1
come	1
in."	1
By	1
and	1
by,	1
as	1
she	1
sat	1
so	1
still,	1
she	1
heard	1
_tap,	1
tap,	1
tap_,	1
and	1
_rustle,	1
whisper,	1
rustle_,	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
window-pane,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
keyhole.	1
"_Who	1
is	1
there?_"	1
she	1
said.	1
"It's	1
the	1
Rain	1
and	1
the	1
Sun,	1
the	1
Rain	1
and	1
the	1
Sun,"	1
said	1
two	1
little	1
voices,	1
together,	1
"and	1
we	1
want	1
to	1
come	1
in!	1
We	1
want	1
to	1
come	1
in!	1
We	1
want	1
to	1
come	1
in!"	1
"Dear,	1
dear!"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
Tulip,	1
"if	1
there	1
are	1
two	1
of	1
you,	1
I	1
s'pose	1
I	1
shall	1
have	1
to	1
let	1
you	1
in."	1
So	1
she	1
opened	1
the	1
door	1
a	1
little	1
wee	1
crack,	1
and	1
in	1
they	1
came.	1
And	1
one	1
took	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
little	1
hands,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
took	1
her	1
other	1
little	1
hand,	1
and	1
they	1
ran,	1
ran,	1
ran	1
with	1
her	1
right	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
ground.	1
Then	1
they	1
said,--	1
"Poke	1
your	1
head	1
through!"	1
So	1
she	1
poked	1
her	1
head	1
through;	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
a	1
beautiful	1
garden.	1
It	1
was	1
early	1
springtime,	1
and	1
few	1
other	1
flowers	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
seen;	1
but	1
she	1
had	1
the	1
birds	1
to	1
sing	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
the	1
sun	1
to	1
shine	1
upon	1
her	1
pretty	1
yellow	1
head.	1
She	1
was	1
so	1
pleased,	1
too,	1
when	1
the	1
children	1
exclaimed	1
with	1
pleasure	1
that	1
now	1
they	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
beautiful	1
spring	1
had	1
come!	1
THE	1
COCK-A-DOO-DLE-DOO	1
A	1
very	1
little	1
boy	1
made	1
this	1
story	1
up	1
"out	1
of	1
his	1
head,"	1
and	1
told	1
it	1
to	1
his	1
papa.	1
I	1
think	1
you	1
littlest	1
ones	1
will	1
like	1
it;	1
I	1
do.	1
Once	1
upon	1
a	1
time	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
boy,	1
and	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
cock-a-doo-dle-doo.	1
So	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
cock-a-doo-dle-doo.	1
And	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
fly	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
sky.	1
So	1
he	1
did	1
fly	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
sky.	1
And	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
get	1
wings	1
and	1
a	1
tail	1
So	1
he	1
did	1
get	1
some	1
wings	1
and	1
a	1
tail.	1
THE	1
CLOUD	1
One	1
hot	1
summer	1
morning	1
a	1
little	1
Cloud	1
rose	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
and	1
floated	1
lightly	1
and	1
happily	1
across	1
the	1
blue	1
sky.	1
Far	1
below	1
lay	1
the	1
earth,	1
brown,	1
dry,	1
and	1
desolate,	1
from	1
drought.	1
The	1
little	1
Cloud	1
could	1
see	1
the	1
poor	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
working	1
and	1
suffering	1
in	1
the	1
hot	1
fields,	1
while	1
she	1
herself	1
floated	1
on	1
the	1
morning	1
breeze,	1
hither	1
and	1
thither,	1
without	1
a	1
care.	1
"Oh,	1
if	1
I	1
could	1
only	1
help	1
the	1
poor	1
people	1
down	1
there!"	1
she	1
thought.	1
"If	1
I	1
could	1
but	1
make	1
their	1
work	1
easier,	1
or	1
give	1
the	1
hungry	1
ones	1
food,	1
or	1
the	1
thirsty	1
a	1
drink!"	1
And	1
as	1
the	1
day	1
passed,	1
and	1
the	1
Cloud	1
became	1
larger,	1
this	1
wish	1
to	1
do	1
something	1
for	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
earth	1
was	1
ever	1
greater	1
in	1
her	1
heart.	1
On	1
earth	1
it	1
grew	1
hotter	1
and	1
hotter;	1
the	1
sun	1
burned	1
down	1
so	1
fiercely	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
fainting	1
in	1
its	1
rays;	1
it	1
seemed	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
must	1
die	1
of	1
heat,	1
and	1
yet	1
they	1
were	1
obliged	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
with	1
their	1
work,	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
very	1
poor.	1
Sometimes	1
they	1
stood	1
and	1
looked	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
Cloud,	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
praying,	1
and	1
saying,	1
"Ah,	1
if	1
you	1
could	1
help	1
us!"	1
"I	1
will	1
help	1
you;	1
I	1
will!"	1
said	1
the	1
Cloud.	1
And	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
sink	1
softly	1
down	1
toward	1
the	1
earth.	1
But	1
suddenly,	1
as	1
she	1
floated	1
down,	1
she	1
remembered	1
something	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
told	1
her	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
tiny	1
Cloud-child,	1
in	1
the	1
lap	1
of	1
Mother	1
Ocean:	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
whispered	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
Clouds	1
go	1
too	1
near	1
the	1
earth	1
they	1
die.	1
When	1
she	1
remembered	1
this	1
she	1
held	1
herself	1
from	1
sinking,	1
and	1
swayed	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
on	1
the	1
breeze,	1
thinking,--thinking.	1
But	1
at	1
last	1
she	1
stood	1
quite	1
still,	1
and	1
spoke	1
boldly	1
and	1
proudly.	1
She	1
said,	1
"Men	1
of	1
earth,	1
I	1
will	1
help	1
you,	1
come	1
what	1
may!"	1
The	1
thought	1
made	1
her	1
suddenly	1
marvellously	1
big	1
and	1
strong	1
and	1
powerful.	1
Never	1
had	1
she	1
dreamed	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
be	1
so	1
big.	1
Like	1
a	1
mighty	1
angel	1
of	1
blessing	1
she	1
stood	1
above	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
lifted	1
her	1
head	1
and	1
spread	1
her	1
wings	1
far	1
over	1
the	1
fields	1
and	1
woods.	1
She	1
was	1
so	1
great,	1
so	1
majestic,	1
that	1
men	1
and	1
animals	1
were	1
awe-struck	1
at	1
the	1
sight;	1
the	1
trees	1
and	1
the	1
grasses	1
bowed	1
before	1
her;	1
yet	1
all	1
the	1
earth-creatures	1
felt	1
that	1
she	1
meant	1
them	1
well.	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
will	1
help	1
you,"	1
cried	1
the	1
Cloud	1
once	1
more.	1
"Take	1
me	1
to	1
yourselves;	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
my	1
life	1
for	1
you!"	1
As	1
she	1
said	1
the	1
words	1
a	1
wonderful	1
light	1
glowed	1
from	1
her	1
heart,	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
thunder	1
rolled	1
through	1
the	1
sky,	1
and	1
a	1
love	1
greater	1
than	1
words	1
can	1
tell	1
filled	1
the	1
Cloud;	1
down,	1
down,	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
earth	1
she	1
swept,	1
and	1
gave	1
up	1
her	1
life	1
in	1
a	1
blessed,	1
healing	1
shower	1
of	1
rain.	1
That	1
rain	1
was	1
the	1
Cloud's	1
great	1
deed;	1
it	1
was	1
her	1
death,	1
too;	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
also	1
her	1
glory.	1
Over	1
the	1
whole	1
country-side,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
the	1
rain	1
fell,	1
a	1
lovely	1
rainbow	1
sprang	1
its	1
arch,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
brightest	1
rays	1
of	1
heaven	1
made	1
its	1
colours;	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
last	1
greeting	1
of	1
a	1
love	1
so	1
great	1
that	1
it	1
sacrificed	1
itself.	1
Soon	1
that,	1
too,	1
was	1
gone,	1
but	1
long,	1
long	1
afterward	1
the	1
men	1
and	1
animals	1
who	1
were	1
saved	1
by	1
the	1
Cloud	1
kept	1
her	1
blessing	1
in	1
their	1
hearts.	1
THE	1
LITTLE	1
RED	1
HEN	1
The	1
little	1
Red	1
Hen	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
farmyard	1
with	1
her	1
chickens,	1
when	1
she	1
found	1
a	1
grain	1
of	1
wheat.	1
"Who	1
will	1
plant	1
this	1
wheat?"	1
she	1
said.	1
"Not	1
I,"	1
said	1
the	1
Goose.	1
"Not	1
I,"	1
said	1
the	1
Duck.	1
"I	1
will,	1
then,"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
Red	1
Hen,	1
and	1
she	1
planted	1
the	1
grain	1
of	1
wheat.	1
When	1
the	1
wheat	1
was	1
ripe	1
she	1
said,	1
"Who	1
will	1
take	1
this	1
wheat	1
to	1
the	1
mill?"	1
"Not	1
I,"	1
said	1
the	1
Goose.	1
"Not	1
I,"	1
said	1
the	1
Duck.	1
"I	1
will,	1
then,"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
Red	1
Hen,	1
and	1
she	1
took	1
the	1
wheat	1
to	1
the	1
mill.	1
When	1
she	1
brought	1
the	1
flour	1
home	1
she	1
said,	1
"Who	1
will	1
make	1
some	1
bread	1
with	1
this	1
flour?"	1
"Not	1
I,"	1
said	1
the	1
Goose.	1
"Not	1
I,"	1
said	1
the	1
Duck.	1
"I	1
will,	1
then,"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
Red	1
Hen.	1
When	1
the	1
bread	1
was	1
baked,	1
she	1
said,	1
"Who	1
will	1
eat	1
this	1
bread?"	1
"I	1
will,"	1
said	1
the	1
Goose.	1
"I	1
will,"	1
said	1
the	1
Duck.	1
"No,	1
you	1
won't,"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
Red	1
Hen.	1
"I	1
shall	1
eat	1
it	1
myself.	1
Cluck!	1
cluck!"	1
And	1
she	1
called	1
her	1
chickens	1
to	1
help	1
her.	1
THE	1
GINGERBREAD	1
MAN	1
Once	1
upon	1
a	1
time	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
old	1
woman	1
and	1
a	1
little	1
old	1
man,	1
and	1
they	1
lived	1
all	1
alone	1
in	1
a	1
little	1
old	1
house.	1
They	1
hadn't	1
any	1
little	1
girls	1
or	1
any	1
little	1
boys,	1
at	1
all.	1
So	1
one	1
day,	1
the	1
little	1
old	1
woman	1
made	1
a	1
boy	1
out	1
of	1
gingerbread;	1
she	1
made	1
him	1
a	1
chocolate	1
jacket,	1
and	1
put	1
raisins	1
on	1
it	1
for	1
buttons;	1
his	1
eyes	1
were	1
made	1
of	1
fine,	1
fat	1
currants;	1
his	1
mouth	1
was	1
made	1
of	1
rose-coloured	1
sugar;	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
gay	1
little	1
cap	1
of	1
orange	1
sugar-candy.	1
When	1
the	1
little	1
old	1
woman	1
had	1
rolled	1
him	1
out,	1
and	1
dressed	1
him	1
up,	1
and	1
pinched	1
his	1
gingerbread	1
shoes	1
into	1
shape,	1
she	1
put	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
pan;	1
then	1
she	1
put	1
the	1
pan	1
in	1
the	1
oven	1
and	1
shut	1
the	1
door;	1
and	1
she	1
thought,	1
"Now	1
I	1
shall	1
have	1
a	1
little	1
boy	1
of	1
my	1
own."	1
When	1
it	1
was	1
time	1
for	1
the	1
Gingerbread	1
Boy	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
she	1
opened	1
the	1
oven	1
door	1
and	1
pulled	1
out	1
the	1
pan.	1
Out	1
jumped	1
the	1
little	1
Gingerbread	1
Boy	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
floor,	1
and	1
away	1
he	1
ran,	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
street!	1
The	1
little	1
old	1
woman	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
old	1
man	1
ran	1
after	1
him	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
they	1
could,	1
but	1
he	1
just	1
laughed,	1
and	1
shouted,--	1
"Run!	1
run!	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
you	1
can!	1
"You	1
can't	1
catch	1
me,	1
I'm	1
the	1
Gingerbread	1
Man!"	1
And	1
they	1
couldn't	1
catch	1
him.	1
The	1
little	1
Gingerbread	1
Boy	1
ran	1
on	1
and	1
on,	1
until	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
cow,	1
by	1
the	1
roadside.	1
"Stop,	1
little	1
Gingerbread	1
Boy,"	1
said	1
the	1
cow;	1
"I	1
want	1
to	1
eat	1
you."	1
The	1
little	1
Gingerbread	1
Boy	1
laughed	1
and	1
said,--	1
"I	1
have	1
run	1
away	1
from	1
a	1
little	1
old	1
woman,	1
"And	1
a	1
little	1
old	1
man,	1
"And	1
I	1
can	1
run	1
away	1
from	1
you,	1
I	1
can!"	1
And,	1
as	1
the	1
cow	1
chased	1
him,	1
he	1
looked	1
over	1
his	1
shoulder	1
and	1
cried,--	1
"Run!	1
run!	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
you	1
can!	1
"You	1
can't	1
catch	1
me,	1
I'm	1
the	1
Gingerbread	1
Man!"	1
And	1
the	1
cow	1
couldn't	1
catch	1
him.	1
The	1
little	1
Gingerbread	1
Boy	1
ran	1
on,	1
and	1
on,	1
and	1
on,	1
till	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
horse,	1
in	1
the	1
pasture.	1
"Please	1
stop,	1
little	1
Gingerbread	1
Boy,"	1
said	1
the	1
horse,	1
"you	1
look	1
very	1
good	1
to	1
eat."	1
But	1
the	1
little	1
Gingerbread	1
Boy	1
laughed	1
out	1
loud.	1
"Oho!	1
oho!"	1
he	1
said,--	1
"I	1
have	1
run	1
away	1
from	1
a	1
little	1
old	1
woman,	1
"A	1
little	1
old	1
man,	1
"A	1
cow,	1
"And	1
I	1
can	1
run	1
away	1
from	1
you,	1
I	1
can!"	1
And,	1
as	1
the	1
horse	1
chased	1
him,	1
he	1
looked	1
over	1
his	1
shoulder	1
and	1
cried,--	1
"Run!	1
run!	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
you	1
can!	1
"You	1
can't	1
catch	1
me,	1
I'm	1
the	1
Gingerbread	1
Man!"	1
And	1
the	1
horse	1
couldn't	1
catch	1
him.	1
By	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
little	1
Gingerbread	1
Boy	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
barn	1
full	1
of	1
threshers.	1
When	1
the	1
threshers	1
smelt	1
the	1
Gingerbread	1
Boy,	1
they	1
tried	1
to	1
pick	1
him	1
up,	1
and	1
said,	1
"Don't	1
run	1
so	1
fast,	1
little	1
Gingerbread	1
Boy;	1
you	1
look	1
very	1
good	1
to	1
eat."	1
But	1
the	1
little	1
Gingerbread	1
Boy	1
ran	1
harder	1
than	1
ever,	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
ran	1
he	1
cried	1
out,--	1
"I	1
have	1
run	1
away	1
from	1
a	1
little	1
old	1
woman,	1
"A	1
little	1
old	1
man,	1
"A	1
cow,	1
"A	1
horse,	1
"And	1
I	1
can	1
run	1
away	1
from	1
you,	1
I	1
can!"	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
found	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
ahead	1
of	1
the	1
threshers,	1
he	1
turned	1
and	1
shouted	1
back	1
to	1
them,--	1
"Run!	1
run!	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
you	1
can!	1
"You	1
can't	1
catch	1
me,	1
I'm	1
the	1
Gingerbread	1
Man!"	1
And	1
the	1
threshers	1
couldn't	1
catch	1
him.	1
Then	1
the	1
little	1
Gingerbread	1
Boy	1
ran	1
faster	1
than	1
ever.	1
He	1
ran	1
and	1
ran	1
until	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
field	1
full	1
of	1
mowers.	1
When	1
the	1
mowers	1
saw	1
how	1
fine	1
he	1
looked,	1
they	1
ran	1
after	1
him,	1
calling	1
out,	1
"Wait	1
a	1
bit!	1
wait	1
a	1
bit,	1
little	1
Gingerbread	1
Boy,	1
we	1
wish	1
to	1
eat	1
you!"	1
But	1
the	1
little	1
Gingerbread	1
Boy	1
laughed	1
harder	1
than	1
ever,	1
and	1
ran	1
like	1
the	1
wind.	1
"Oho!	1
oho!"	1
he	1
said,--	1
"I	1
have	1
run	1
away	1
from	1
a	1
little	1
old	1
woman,	1
"A	1
little	1
old	1
man,	1
"A	1
cow,	1
"A	1
horse,	1
"A	1
barn	1
full	1
of	1
threshers,	1
"And	1
I	1
can	1
run	1
away	1
from	1
you,	1
I	1
can!"	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
found	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
ahead	1
of	1
the	1
mowers,	1
he	1
turned	1
and	1
shouted	1
back	1
to	1
them,--	1
"Run!	1
run!	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
you	1
can!	1
"You	1
can't	1
catch	1
me,	1
I'm	1
the	1
Gingerbread	1
Man!"	1
And	1
the	1
mowers	1
couldn't	1
catch	1
him.	1
By	1
this	1
time	1
the	1
little	1
Gingerbread	1
Boy	1
was	1
so	1
proud	1
that	1
he	1
didn't	1
think	1
anybody	1
could	1
catch	1
him.	1
Pretty	1
soon	1
he	1
saw	1
a	1
fox	1
coming	1
across	1
a	1
field.	1
The	1
fox	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
run.	1
But	1
the	1
little	1
Gingerbread	1
Boy	1
shouted	1
across	1
to	1
him,	1
"You	1
can't	1
catch	1
me!"	1
The	1
fox	1
began	1
to	1
run	1
faster,	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
Gingerbread	1
Boy	1
ran	1
faster,	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
ran	1
he	1
chuckled,--	1
"I	1
have	1
run	1
away	1
from	1
a	1
little	1
old	1
woman,	1
"A	1
little	1
old	1
man,	1
"A	1
cow,	1
"A	1
horse,	1
"A	1
barn	1
full	1
of	1
threshers,	1
"A	1
field	1
full	1
of	1
mowers,	1
"And	1
I	1
can	1
run	1
away	1
from	1
you,	1
I	1
can!	1
"Run!	1
run!	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
you	1
can!	1
"You	1
can't	1
catch	1
me,	1
I'm	1
the	1
Gingerbread	1
Man!"	1
"Why,"	1
said	1
the	1
fox,	1
"I	1
would	1
not	1
catch	1
you	1
if	1
I	1
could.	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
think	1
of	1
disturbing	1
you."	1
Just	1
then,	1
the	1
little	1
Gingerbread	1
Boy	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
river.	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
swim	1
across,	1
and	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
keep	1
running	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
cow	1
and	1
the	1
horse	1
and	1
the	1
people.	1
"Jump	1
on	1
my	1
tail,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
you	1
across,"	1
said	1
the	1
fox.	1
So	1
the	1
little	1
Gingerbread	1
Boy	1
jumped	1
on	1
the	1
fox's	1
tail,	1
and	1
the	1
fox	1
began	1
to	1
swim	1
the	1
river.	1
When	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
way	1
from	1
the	1
bank	1
he	1
turned	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
said,	1
"You	1
are	1
too	1
heavy	1
on	1
my	1
tail,	1
little	1
Gingerbread	1
Boy,	1
I	1
fear	1
I	1
shall	1
let	1
you	1
get	1
wet;	1
jump	1
on	1
my	1
back."	1
The	1
little	1
Gingerbread	1
Boy	1
jumped	1
on	1
his	1
back.	1
A	1
little	1
farther	1
out,	1
the	1
fox	1
said,	1
"I	1
am	1
afraid	1
the	1
water	1
will	1
cover	1
you,	1
there;	1
jump	1
on	1
my	1
shoulder."	1
The	1
little	1
Gingerbread	1
Boy	1
jumped	1
on	1
his	1
shoulder.	1
In	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
stream	1
the	1
fox	1
said,	1
"Oh,	1
dear!	1
little	1
Gingerbread	1
Boy,	1
my	1
shoulder	1
is	1
sinking;	1
jump	1
on	1
my	1
nose,	1
and	1
I	1
can	1
hold	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
water."	1
So	1
the	1
little	1
Gingerbread	1
Boy	1
jumped	1
on	1
his	1
nose.	1
The	1
minute	1
the	1
fox	1
reached	1
the	1
bank	1
he	1
threw	1
back	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
gave	1
a	1
snap!	1
"Dear	1
me!"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
Gingerbread	1
Boy,	1
"I	1
am	1
a	1
quarter	1
gone!"	1
The	1
next	1
minute	1
he	1
said,	1
"Why,	1
I	1
am	1
half	1
gone!"	1
The	1
next	1
minute	1
he	1
said,	1
"My	1
goodness	1
gracious,	1
I	1
am	1
three	1
quarters	1
gone!"	1
And	1
after	1
that,	1
the	1
little	1
Gingerbread	1
Boy	1
never	1
said	1
anything	1
more	1
at	1
all.	1
THE	1
LITTLE	1
JACKALS	1
AND	1
THE	1
LION	1
Once	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
big	1
jungle;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
jungle	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
big	1
Lion;	1
and	1
the	1
Lion	1
was	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
jungle.	1
Whenever	1
he	1
wanted	1
anything	1
to	1
eat,	1
all	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
do	1
was	1
to	1
come	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
cave	1
in	1
the	1
stones	1
and	1
earth	1
and	1
_roar_.	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
roared	1
a	1
few	1
times	1
all	1
the	1
little	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
jungle	1
were	1
so	1
frightened	1
that	1
they	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
holes	1
and	1
hiding-places	1
and	1
ran,	1
this	1
way	1
and	1
that,	1
to	1
get	1
away.	1
Then,	1
of	1
course,	1
the	1
Lion	1
could	1
see	1
where	1
they	1
were.	1
And	1
he	1
pounced	1
on	1
them,	1
killed	1
them,	1
and	1
gobbled	1
them	1
up.	1
He	1
did	1
this	1
so	1
often	1
that	1
at	1
last	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
single	1
thing	1
left	1
alive	1
in	1
the	1
jungle	1
besides	1
the	1
Lion,	1
except	1
two	1
little	1
Jackals,--a	1
little	1
father	1
Jackal	1
and	1
a	1
little	1
mother	1
Jackal.	1
They	1
had	1
run	1
away	1
so	1
many	1
times	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
quite	1
thin	1
and	1
very	1
tired,	1
and	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
run	1
so	1
fast	1
any	1
more.	1
And	1
one	1
day	1
the	1
Lion	1
was	1
so	1
near	1
that	1
the	1
little	1
mother	1
Jackal	1
grew	1
frightened;	1
she	1
said,--	1
"Oh,	1
Father	1
Jackal,	1
Father	1
Jackal!	1
I	1
b'lieve	1
our	1
time	1
has	1
come!	1
the	1
Lion	1
will	1
surely	1
catch	1
us	1
this	1
time!"	1
"Pooh!	1
nonsense,	1
mother!"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
father	1
Jackal.	1
"Come,	1
we'll	1
run	1
on	1
a	1
bit!"	1
And	1
they	1
ran,	1
ran,	1
ran	1
very	1
fast,	1
and	1
the	1
Lion	1
did	1
not	1
catch	1
them	1
that	1
time.	1
But	1
at	1
last	1
a	1
day	1
came	1
when	1
the	1
Lion	1
was	1
nearer	1
still	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
mother	1
Jackal	1
was	1
frightened	1
almost	1
to	1
death.	1
"Oh,	1
Father	1
Jackal,	1
Father	1
Jackal!"	1
she	1
cried;	1
"I'm	1
sure	1
our	1
time	1
has	1
come!	1
The	1
Lion's	1
going	1
to	1
eat	1
us	1
this	1
time!"	1
"Now,	1
mother,	1
don't	1
you	1
fret,"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
father	1
Jackal;	1
"you	1
do	1
just	1
as	1
I	1
tell	1
you,	1
and	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
all	1
right."	1
Then	1
what	1
did	1
those	1
cunning	1
little	1
Jackals	1
do	1
but	1
take	1
hold	1
of	1
hands	1
and	1
run	1
up	1
towards	1
the	1
Lion,	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
meant	1
to	1
come	1
all	1
the	1
time.	1
When	1
he	1
saw	1
them	1
coming	1
he	1
stood	1
up,	1
and	1
roared	1
in	1
a	1
terrible	1
voice,--	1
"You	1
miserable	1
little	1
wretches,	1
come	1
here	1
and	1
be	1
eaten,	1
at	1
once!	1
Why	1
didn't	1
you	1
come	1
before?"	1
The	1
father	1
Jackal	1
bowed	1
very	1
low.	1
"Indeed,	1
Father	1
Lion,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"we	1
meant	1
to	1
come	1
before;	1
we	1
knew	1
we	1
ought	1
to	1
come	1
before;	1
and	1
we	1
wanted	1
to	1
come	1
before;	1
but	1
every	1
time	1
we	1
started	1
to	1
come,	1
a	1
dreadful	1
great	1
lion	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
woods	1
and	1
roared	1
at	1
us,	1
and	1
frightened	1
us	1
so	1
that	1
we	1
ran	1
away."	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
mean?"	1
roared	1
the	1
Lion.	1
"There's	1
no	1
other	1
lion	1
in	1
this	1
jungle,	1
and	1
you	1
know	1
it!"	1
"Indeed,	1
indeed,	1
Father	1
Lion,"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
Jackal,	1
"I	1
know	1
that	1
is	1
what	1
everybody	1
thinks;	1
but	1
indeed	1
and	1
indeed	1
there	1
is	1
another	1
lion!	1
And	1
he	1
is	1
as	1
much	1
bigger	1
than	1
you	1
as	1
you	1
are	1
bigger	1
than	1
I!	1
His	1
face	1
is	1
much	1
more	1
terrible,	1
and	1
his	1
roar	1
far,	1
far	1
more	1
dreadful.	1
Oh,	1
he	1
is	1
far	1
more	1
fearful	1
than	1
you!"	1
At	1
that	1
the	1
Lion	1
stood	1
up	1
and	1
roared	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
jungle	1
shook.	1
"Take	1
me	1
to	1
this	1
Lion,"	1
he	1
said;	1
"I'll	1
eat	1
him	1
up	1
and	1
then	1
I'll	1
eat	1
you	1
up."	1
The	1
little	1
Jackals	1
danced	1
on	1
ahead,	1
and	1
the	1
Lion	1
stalked	1
behind.	1
They	1
led	1
him	1
to	1
a	1
place	1
where	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
round,	1
deep	1
well	1
of	1
clear	1
water.	1
They	1
went	1
round	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
the	1
Lion	1
stalked	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
other.	1
"He	1
lives	1
down	1
there,	1
Father	1
Lion!"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
Jackal.	1
"He	1
lives	1
down	1
there!"	1
The	1
Lion	1
came	1
close	1
and	1
looked	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
water,--and	1
a	1
lion's	1
face	1
looked	1
back	1
at	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
water!	1
When	1
he	1
saw	1
that,	1
the	1
Lion	1
roared	1
and	1
shook	1
his	1
mane	1
and	1
showed	1
his	1
teeth.	1
And	1
the	1
lion	1
in	1
the	1
water	1
shook	1
his	1
mane	1
and	1
showed	1
his	1
teeth.	1
The	1
Lion	1
above	1
shook	1
his	1
mane	1
again	1
and	1
growled	1
again,	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
terrible	1
face.	1
But	1
the	1
lion	1
in	1
the	1
water	1
made	1
just	1
as	1
terrible	1
a	1
one,	1
back.	1
The	1
Lion	1
above	1
couldn't	1
stand	1
that.	1
He	1
leaped	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
well	1
after	1
the	1
other	1
lion.	1
But,	1
of	1
course,	1
as	1
you	1
know	1
very	1
well,	1
there	1
wasn't	1
any	1
other	1
lion!	1
It	1
was	1
only	1
the	1
reflection	1
in	1
the	1
water!	1
So	1
the	1
poor	1
old	1
Lion	1
floundered	1
about	1
and	1
floundered	1
about,	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
couldn't	1
get	1
up	1
the	1
steep	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
well,	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
last	1
drowned.	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
drowned,	1
the	1
little	1
Jackals	1
took	1
hold	1
of	1
hands	1
and	1
danced	1
round	1
the	1
well,	1
and	1
sang,--	1
"The	1
Lion	1
is	1
dead!	1
The	1
Lion	1
is	1
dead!	1
"We	1
have	1
killed	1
the	1
great	1
Lion	1
who	1
would	1
have	1
killed	1
us!	1
"The	1
Lion	1
is	1
dead!	1
The	1
Lion	1
is	1
dead!	1
"Ao!	1
Ao!	1
Ao!"	1
THE	1
COUNTRY	1
MOUSE	1
AND	1
THE	1
CITY	1
MOUSE	1
Once	1
a	1
little	1
mouse	1
who	1
lived	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
invited	1
a	1
little	1
mouse	1
from	1
the	1
city	1
to	1
visit	1
him.	1
When	1
the	1
little	1
City	1
Mouse	1
sat	1
down	1
to	1
dinner	1
he	1
was	1
surprised	1
to	1
find	1
that	1
the	1
Country	1
Mouse	1
had	1
nothing	1
to	1
eat	1
except	1
barley	1
and	1
grain.	1
"Really,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"you	1
do	1
not	1
live	1
well	1
at	1
all;	1
you	1
should	1
see	1
how	1
I	1
live!	1
I	1
have	1
all	1
sorts	1
of	1
fine	1
things	1
to	1
eat	1
every	1
day.	1
You	1
must	1
come	1
to	1
visit	1
me	1
and	1
see	1
how	1
nice	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
live	1
in	1
the	1
city."	1
The	1
little	1
Country	1
Mouse	1
was	1
glad	1
to	1
do	1
this,	1
and	1
after	1
a	1
while	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
city	1
to	1
visit	1
his	1
friend.	1
The	1
very	1
first	1
place	1
that	1
the	1
City	1
Mouse	1
took	1
the	1
Country	1
Mouse	1
to	1
see	1
was	1
the	1
kitchen	1
cupboard	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
where	1
he	1
lived.	1
There,	1
on	1
the	1
lowest	1
shelf,	1
behind	1
some	1
stone	1
jars,	1
stood	1
a	1
big	1
paper	1
bag	1
of	1
brown	1
sugar.	1
The	1
little	1
City	1
Mouse	1
gnawed	1
a	1
hole	1
in	1
the	1
bag	1
and	1
invited	1
his	1
friend	1
to	1
nibble	1
for	1
himself.	1
The	1
two	1
little	1
mice	1
nibbled	1
and	1
nibbled,	1
and	1
the	1
Country	1
Mouse	1
thought	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
tasted	1
anything	1
so	1
delicious	1
in	1
his	1
life.	1
He	1
was	1
just	1
thinking	1
how	1
lucky	1
the	1
City	1
Mouse	1
was,	1
when	1
suddenly	1
the	1
door	1
opened	1
with	1
a	1
bang,	1
and	1
in	1
came	1
the	1
cook	1
to	1
get	1
some	1
flour.	1
"Run!"	1
whispered	1
the	1
City	1
Mouse.	1
And	1
they	1
ran	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
they	1
could	1
to	1
the	1
little	1
hole	1
where	1
they	1
had	1
come	1
in.	1
The	1
little	1
Country	1
Mouse	1
was	1
shaking	1
all	1
over	1
when	1
they	1
got	1
safely	1
away,	1
but	1
the	1
little	1
City	1
Mouse	1
said,	1
"That	1
is	1
nothing;	1
she	1
will	1
soon	1
go	1
away	1
and	1
then	1
we	1
can	1
go	1
back."	1
After	1
the	1
cook	1
had	1
gone	1
away	1
and	1
shut	1
the	1
door	1
they	1
stole	1
softly	1
back,	1
and	1
this	1
time	1
the	1
City	1
Mouse	1
had	1
something	1
new	1
to	1
show:	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
little	1
Country	1
Mouse	1
into	1
a	1
corner	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
shelf,	1
where	1
a	1
big	1
jar	1
of	1
dried	1
prunes	1
stood	1
open.	1
After	1
much	1
tugging	1
and	1
pulling	1
they	1
got	1
a	1
large	1
dried	1
prune	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
jar	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
shelf	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
nibble	1
at	1
it.	1
This	1
was	1
even	1
better	1
than	1
the	1
brown	1
sugar.	1
The	1
little	1
Country	1
Mouse	1
liked	1
the	1
taste	1
so	1
much	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
hardly	1
nibble	1
fast	1
enough.	1
But	1
all	1
at	1
once,	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
their	1
eating,	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
scratching	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
a	1
sharp,	1
loud	1
_miaouw_!	1
"What	1
is	1
that?"	1
said	1
the	1
Country	1
Mouse.	1
The	1
City	1
Mouse	1
just	1
whispered,	1
"Sh!"	1
and	1
ran	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
to	1
the	1
hole.	1
The	1
Country	1
Mouse	1
ran	1
after,	1
you	1
may	1
be	1
sure,	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
_he_	1
could.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
out	1
of	1
danger	1
the	1
City	1
Mouse	1
said,	1
"That	1
was	1
the	1
old	1
Cat;	1
she	1
is	1
the	1
best	1
mouser	1
in	1
town,--if	1
she	1
once	1
gets	1
you,	1
you	1
are	1
lost."	1
"This	1
is	1
very	1
terrible,"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
Country	1
Mouse;	1
"let	1
us	1
not	1
go	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
cupboard	1
again."	1
"No,"	1
said	1
the	1
City	1
Mouse,	1
"I	1
will	1
take	1
you	1
to	1
the	1
cellar;	1
there	1
is	1
something	1
specially	1
fine	1
there."	1
So	1
the	1
City	1
Mouse	1
took	1
his	1
little	1
friend	1
down	1
the	1
cellar	1
stairs	1
and	1
into	1
a	1
big	1
cupboard	1
where	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
shelves.	1
On	1
the	1
shelves	1
were	1
jars	1
of	1
butter,	1
and	1
cheeses	1
in	1
bags	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
bags.	1
Overhead	1
hung	1
bunches	1
of	1
sausages,	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
spicy	1
apples	1
in	1
barrels	1
standing	1
about.	1
It	1
smelt	1
so	1
good	1
that	1
it	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
little	1
Country	1
Mouse's	1
head.	1
He	1
ran	1
along	1
the	1
shelf	1
and	1
nibbled	1
at	1
a	1
cheese	1
here,	1
and	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
butter	1
there,	1
until	1
he	1
saw	1
an	1
especially	1
rich,	1
very	1
delicious-smelling	1
piece	1
of	1
cheese	1
on	1
a	1
queer	1
little	1
stand	1
in	1
a	1
corner.	1
He	1
was	1
just	1
on	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
putting	1
his	1
teeth	1
into	1
the	1
cheese	1
when	1
the	1
City	1
Mouse	1
saw	1
him.	1
"Stop!	1
stop!"	1
cried	1
the	1
City	1
Mouse.	1
"That	1
is	1
a	1
trap!"	1
The	1
little	1
Country	1
Mouse	1
stopped	1
and	1
said,	1
"What	1
is	1
a	1
trap?"	1
"That	1
thing	1
is	1
a	1
trap,"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
City	1
Mouse.	1
"The	1
minute	1
you	1
touch	1
the	1
cheese	1
with	1
your	1
teeth	1
something	1
comes	1
down	1
on	1
your	1
head	1
hard,	1
and	1
you're	1
dead."	1
The	1
little	1
Country	1
Mouse	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
trap,	1
and	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
cheese,	1
and	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
little	1
City	1
Mouse.	1
"If	1
you'll	1
excuse	1
me,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"I	1
think	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
home.	1
I'd	1
rather	1
have	1
barley	1
and	1
grain	1
to	1
eat	1
and	1
eat	1
it	1
in	1
peace	1
and	1
comfort,	1
than	1
have	1
brown	1
sugar	1
and	1
dried	1
prunes	1
and	1
cheese,--and	1
be	1
frightened	1
to	1
death	1
all	1
the	1
time!"	1
So	1
the	1
little	1
Country	1
Mouse	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
his	1
home,	1
and	1
there	1
he	1
stayed	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
his	1
life.	1
LITTLE	1
JACK	1
ROLLAROUND	1
Once	1
upon	1
a	1
time	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
wee	1
little	1
boy	1
who	1
slept	1
in	1
a	1
tiny	1
trundle-bed	1
near	1
his	1
mother's	1
great	1
bed.	1
The	1
trundle-bed	1
had	1
castors	1
on	1
it	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
could	1
be	1
rolled	1
about,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
the	1
little	1
boy	1
liked	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
to	1
have	1
it	1
rolled.	1
When	1
his	1
mother	1
came	1
to	1
bed	1
he	1
would	1
cry,	1
"Roll	1
me	1
around!	1
roll	1
me	1
around!"	1
And	1
his	1
mother	1
would	1
put	1
out	1
her	1
hand	1
from	1
the	1
big	1
bed	1
and	1
push	1
the	1
little	1
bed	1
back	1
and	1
forth	1
till	1
she	1
was	1
tired.	1
The	1
little	1
boy	1
could	1
never	1
get	1
enough;	1
so	1
for	1
this	1
he	1
was	1
called	1
"Little	1
Jack	1
Rollaround."	1
One	1
night	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
his	1
mother	1
roll	1
him	1
about,	1
till	1
she	1
fell	1
asleep,	1
and	1
even	1
then	1
he	1
kept	1
crying,	1
"Roll	1
me	1
around!	1
roll	1
me	1
around!"	1
His	1
mother	1
pushed	1
him	1
about	1
in	1
her	1
sleep,	1
until	1
her	1
slumber	1
became	1
too	1
sound;	1
then	1
she	1
stopped.	1
But	1
Little	1
Jack	1
Rollaround	1
kept	1
on	1
crying,	1
"Roll	1
around!	1
roll	1
around!"	1
By	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
Moon	1
peeped	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
window.	1
He	1
saw	1
a	1
funny	1
sight:	1
Little	1
Jack	1
Rollaround	1
was	1
lying	1
in	1
his	1
trundle-bed,	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
put	1
up	1
one	1
little	1
fat	1
leg	1
for	1
a	1
mast,	1
and	1
fastened	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
his	1
wee	1
shirt	1
to	1
it	1
for	1
a	1
sail;	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
blowing	1
at	1
it	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
might,	1
and	1
saying,	1
"Roll	1
around!	1
roll	1
around!"	1
Slowly,	1
slowly,	1
the	1
little	1
trundle-bed	1
boat	1
began	1
to	1
move;	1
it	1
sailed	1
along	1
the	1
floor	1
and	1
up	1
the	1
wall	1
and	1
across	1
the	1
ceiling	1
and	1
down	1
again!	1
"More!	1
more!"	1
cried	1
Little	1
Jack	1
Rollaround;	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
boat	1
sailed	1
faster	1
up	1
the	1
wall,	1
across	1
the	1
ceiling,	1
down	1
the	1
wall,	1
and	1
over	1
the	1
floor.	1
The	1
Moon	1
laughed	1
at	1
the	1
sight;	1
but	1
when	1
Little	1
Jack	1
Rollaround	1
saw	1
the	1
Moon,	1
he	1
called	1
out,	1
"Open	1
the	1
door,	1
old	1
Moon!	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
roll	1
through	1
the	1
town,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
can	1
see	1
me!"	1
The	1
Moon	1
could	1
not	1
open	1
the	1
door,	1
but	1
he	1
shone	1
in	1
through	1
the	1
keyhole,	1
in	1
a	1
broad	1
band.	1
And	1
Little	1
Jack	1
Rollaround	1
sailed	1
his	1
trundle-bed	1
boat	1
up	1
the	1
beam,	1
through	1
the	1
keyhole,	1
and	1
into	1
the	1
street.	1
"Make	1
a	1
light,	1
old	1
Moon,"	1
he	1
said;	1
"I	1
want	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
see	1
me!"	1
So	1
the	1
good	1
Moon	1
made	1
a	1
light	1
and	1
went	1
along	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
trundle-bed	1
boat	1
went	1
sailing	1
down	1
the	1
streets	1
into	1
the	1
main	1
street	1
of	1
the	1
village.	1
They	1
rolled	1
past	1
the	1
town	1
hall	1
and	1
the	1
schoolhouse	1
and	1
the	1
church;	1
but	1
nobody	1
saw	1
little	1
Jack	1
Rollaround,	1
because	1
everybody	1
was	1
in	1
bed,	1
asleep.	1
"Why	1
don't	1
the	1
people	1
come	1
to	1
see	1
me?"	1
he	1
shouted.	1
High	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
church	1
steeple,	1
the	1
Weather-vane	1
answered,	1
"It	1
is	1
no	1
time	1
for	1
people	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
streets;	1
decent	1
folk	1
are	1
in	1
their	1
beds."	1
"Then	1
I'll	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
woods,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
animals	1
may	1
see	1
me,"	1
said	1
Little	1
Jack.	1
"Come	1
along,	1
old	1
Moon,	1
and	1
make	1
a	1
light!"	1
The	1
good	1
Moon	1
went	1
along	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
light,	1
and	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
forest.	1
"Roll!	1
roll!"	1
cried	1
the	1
little	1
boy;	1
and	1
the	1
trundle-bed	1
went	1
trundling	1
among	1
the	1
trees	1
in	1
the	1
great	1
wood,	1
scaring	1
up	1
the	1
squirrels	1
and	1
startling	1
the	1
little	1
leaves	1
on	1
the	1
trees.	1
The	1
poor	1
old	1
Moon	1
began	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
bad	1
time	1
of	1
it,	1
for	1
the	1
tree-trunks	1
got	1
in	1
his	1
way	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
go	1
so	1
fast	1
as	1
the	1
bed,	1
and	1
every	1
time	1
he	1
got	1
behind,	1
the	1
little	1
boy	1
called,	1
"Hurry	1
up,	1
old	1
Moon,	1
I	1
want	1
the	1
beasts	1
to	1
see	1
me!"	1
But	1
all	1
the	1
animals	1
were	1
asleep,	1
and	1
nobody	1
at	1
all	1
looked	1
at	1
Little	1
Jack	1
Rollaround	1
except	1
an	1
old	1
White	1
Owl;	1
and	1
all	1
she	1
said	1
was,	1
"Who	1
are	1
you?"	1
The	1
little	1
boy	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
her,	1
so	1
he	1
blew	1
harder,	1
and	1
the	1
trundle-bed	1
boat	1
went	1
sailing	1
through	1
the	1
forest	1
till	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
"I	1
must	1
go	1
home	1
now;	1
it	1
is	1
late,"	1
said	1
the	1
Moon.	1
"I	1
will	1
go	1
with	1
you;	1
make	1
a	1
path!"	1
said	1
Little	1
Jack	1
Rollaround.	1
The	1
kind	1
Moon	1
made	1
a	1
path	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
sky,	1
and	1
up	1
sailed	1
the	1
little	1
bed	1
into	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
sky.	1
All	1
the	1
little	1
bright	1
Stars	1
were	1
there	1
with	1
their	1
nice	1
little	1
lamps.	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
them,	1
that	1
naughty	1
Little	1
Jack	1
Rollaround	1
began	1
to	1
tease.	1
"Out	1
of	1
the	1
way,	1
there!	1
I	1
am	1
coming!"	1
he	1
shouted,	1
and	1
sailed	1
the	1
trundle-bed	1
boat	1
straight	1
at	1
them.	1
He	1
bumped	1
the	1
little	1
Stars	1
right	1
and	1
left,	1
all	1
over	1
the	1
sky,	1
until	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
put	1
his	1
little	1
lamp	1
out	1
and	1
left	1
it	1
dark.	1
"Do	1
not	1
treat	1
the	1
little	1
Stars	1
so,"	1
said	1
the	1
good	1
Moon.	1
But	1
Jack	1
Rollaround	1
only	1
behaved	1
the	1
worse:	1
"Get	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way,	1
old	1
Moon!"	1
he	1
shouted,	1
"I	1
am	1
coming!"	1
And	1
he	1
steered	1
the	1
little	1
trundle-bed	1
boat	1
straight	1
into	1
the	1
old	1
Moon's	1
face,	1
and	1
bumped	1
his	1
nose!	1
This	1
was	1
too	1
much	1
for	1
the	1
good	1
Moon;	1
he	1
put	1
out	1
his	1
big	1
light,	1
all	1
at	1
once,	1
and	1
left	1
the	1
sky	1
pitch-black.	1
"Make	1
a	1
light,	1
old	1
Moon!	1
Make	1
a	1
light!"	1
shouted	1
the	1
little	1
boy.	1
But	1
the	1
Moon	1
answered	1
never	1
a	1
word,	1
and	1
Jack	1
Rollaround	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
where	1
to	1
steer.	1
He	1
went	1
rolling	1
criss-cross,	1
up	1
and	1
down,	1
all	1
over	1
the	1
sky,	1
knocking	1
into	1
the	1
planets	1
and	1
stumbling	1
into	1
the	1
clouds,	1
till	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
where	1
he	1
was.	1
Suddenly	1
he	1
saw	1
a	1
big	1
yellow	1
light	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
sky.	1
He	1
thought	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
Moon.	1
"Look	1
out,	1
I	1
am	1
coming!"	1
he	1
cried,	1
and	1
steered	1
for	1
the	1
light.	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
kind	1
old	1
Moon	1
at	1
all;	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
great	1
mother	1
Sun,	1
just	1
coming	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
home	1
in	1
the	1
sea,	1
to	1
begin	1
her	1
day's	1
work.	1
"Aha,	1
youngster,	1
what	1
are	1
you	1
doing	1
in	1
my	1
sky?"	1
she	1
said.	1
And	1
she	1
picked	1
Little	1
Jack	1
Rollaround	1
up	1
and	1
threw	1
him,	1
trundle-bed	1
boat	1
and	1
all,	1
into	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
sea!	1
And	1
I	1
suppose	1
he	1
is	1
there	1
yet,	1
unless	1
somebody	1
picked	1
him	1
out	1
again.	1
HOW	1
BROTHER	1
RABBIT	1
FOOLED	1
THE	1
WHALE	1
AND	1
THE	1
ELEPHANT	1
One	1
day	1
little	1
Brother	1
Rabbit	1
was	1
running	1
along	1
on	1
the	1
sand,	1
lippety,	1
lippety,	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
Whale	1
and	1
the	1
Elephant	1
talking	1
together.	1
Little	1
Brother	1
Rabbit	1
crouched	1
down	1
and	1
listened	1
to	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
saying.	1
This	1
was	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
saying:--	1
"You	1
are	1
the	1
biggest	1
thing	1
on	1
the	1
land,	1
Brother	1
Elephant,"	1
said	1
the	1
Whale,	1
"and	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
biggest	1
thing	1
in	1
the	1
sea;	1
if	1
we	1
join	1
together	1
we	1
can	1
rule	1
all	1
the	1
animals	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
have	1
our	1
way	1
about	1
everything."	1
"Very	1
good,	1
very	1
good,"	1
trumpeted	1
the	1
Elephant;	1
"that	1
suits	1
me;	1
we	1
will	1
do	1
it."	1
Little	1
Brother	1
Rabbit	1
sniggered	1
to	1
himself.	1
"They	1
won't	1
rule	1
me,"	1
he	1
said.	1
He	1
ran	1
away	1
and	1
got	1
a	1
very	1
long,	1
very	1
strong	1
rope,	1
and	1
he	1
got	1
his	1
big	1
drum,	1
and	1
hid	1
the	1
drum	1
a	1
long	1
way	1
off	1
in	1
the	1
bushes.	1
Then	1
he	1
went	1
along	1
the	1
beach	1
till	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
Whale.	1
"Oh,	1
please,	1
dear,	1
strong	1
Mr	1
Whale,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"will	1
you	1
have	1
the	1
great	1
kindness	1
to	1
do	1
me	1
a	1
favour?	1
My	1
cow	1
is	1
stuck	1
in	1
the	1
mud,	1
a	1
quarter	1
of	1
a	1
mile	1
from	1
here.	1
And	1
I	1
can't	1
pull	1
her	1
out.	1
But	1
you	1
are	1
so	1
strong	1
and	1
so	1
obliging,	1
that	1
I	1
venture	1
to	1
trust	1
you	1
will	1
help	1
me	1
out."	1
The	1
Whale	1
was	1
so	1
pleased	1
with	1
the	1
compliment	1
that	1
he	1
said,	1
"Yes,"	1
at	1
once.	1
"Then,"	1
said	1
the	1
Rabbit,	1
"I	1
will	1
tie	1
this	1
end	1
of	1
my	1
long	1
rope	1
to	1
you,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
run	1
away	1
and	1
tie	1
the	1
other	1
end	1
round	1
my	1
cow,	1
and	1
when	1
I	1
am	1
ready	1
I	1
will	1
beat	1
my	1
big	1
drum.	1
When	1
you	1
hear	1
that,	1
pull	1
very,	1
very	1
hard,	1
for	1
the	1
cow	1
is	1
stuck	1
very	1
deep	1
in	1
the	1
mud."	1
"Huh!"	1
grunted	1
the	1
Whale,	1
"I'll	1
pull	1
her	1
out,	1
if	1
she	1
is	1
stuck	1
to	1
the	1
horns."	1
Little	1
Brother	1
Rabbit	1
tied	1
the	1
rope-end	1
to	1
the	1
Whale,	1
and	1
ran	1
off,	1
lippety,	1
lippety,	1
till	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
the	1
Elephant	1
was.	1
"Oh,	1
please,	1
mighty	1
and	1
kindly	1
Elephant,"	1
he	1
said,	1
making	1
a	1
very	1
low	1
bow,	1
"will	1
you	1
do	1
me	1
a	1
favour?"	1
"What	1
is	1
it?"	1
asked	1
the	1
Elephant.	1
"My	1
cow	1
is	1
stuck	1
in	1
the	1
mud,	1
about	1
a	1
quarter	1
of	1
a	1
mile	1
from	1
here,"	1
said	1
little	1
Brother	1
Rabbit,	1
"and	1
I	1
cannot	1
pull	1
her	1
out.	1
Of	1
course	1
you	1
could.	1
If	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
so	1
very	1
obliging	1
as	1
to	1
help	1
me----"	1
"Certainly,"	1
said	1
the	1
Elephant	1
grandly,	1
"certainly."	1
"Then,"	1
said	1
little	1
Brother	1
Rabbit,	1
"I	1
will	1
tie	1
one	1
end	1
of	1
this	1
long	1
rope	1
to	1
your	1
trunk,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
to	1
my	1
cow,	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
tied	1
her	1
tightly	1
I	1
will	1
beat	1
my	1
big	1
drum.	1
When	1
you	1
hear	1
that,	1
pull;	1
pull	1
as	1
hard	1
as	1
you	1
can,	1
for	1
my	1
cow	1
is	1
very	1
heavy."	1
"Never	1
fear,"	1
said	1
the	1
Elephant,	1
"I	1
could	1
pull	1
twenty	1
cows."	1
"I	1
am	1
sure	1
you	1
could,"	1
said	1
the	1
Rabbit,	1
politely,	1
"only	1
be	1
sure	1
to	1
begin	1
gently,	1
and	1
pull	1
harder	1
and	1
harder	1
till	1
you	1
get	1
her."	1
Then	1
he	1
tied	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
rope	1
tightly	1
round	1
the	1
Elephant's	1
trunk,	1
and	1
ran	1
away	1
into	1
the	1
bushes.	1
There	1
he	1
sat	1
down	1
and	1
beat	1
the	1
big	1
drum.	1
The	1
Whale	1
began	1
to	1
pull,	1
and	1
the	1
Elephant	1
began	1
to	1
pull,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
jiffy	1
the	1
rope	1
tightened	1
till	1
it	1
was	1
stretched	1
as	1
hard	1
as	1
could	1
be.	1
"This	1
is	1
a	1
remarkably	1
heavy	1
cow,"	1
said	1
the	1
Elephant;	1
"but	1
I'll	1
fetch	1
her!"	1
And	1
he	1
braced	1
his	1
forefeet	1
in	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
gave	1
a	1
tremendous	1
pull.	1
"Dear	1
me!"	1
said	1
the	1
Whale.	1
"That	1
cow	1
must	1
be	1
stuck	1
mighty	1
tight";	1
and	1
he	1
drove	1
his	1
tail	1
deep	1
in	1
the	1
water,	1
and	1
gave	1
a	1
marvellous	1
pull.	1
He	1
pulled	1
harder;	1
the	1
Elephant	1
pulled	1
harder.	1
Pretty	1
soon	1
the	1
Whale	1
found	1
himself	1
sliding	1
toward	1
the	1
land.	1
The	1
reason	1
was,	1
of	1
course,	1
that	1
the	1
Elephant	1
had	1
something	1
solid	1
to	1
brace	1
against,	1
and,	1
beside,	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
he	1
pulled	1
the	1
rope	1
in	1
a	1
little,	1
he	1
took	1
a	1
turn	1
with	1
it	1
round	1
his	1
trunk!	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
Whale	1
found	1
himself	1
sliding	1
toward	1
the	1
land	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
provoked	1
with	1
the	1
cow	1
that	1
he	1
dived	1
head	1
first,	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
sea.	1
That	1
was	1
a	1
pull!	1
The	1
Elephant	1
was	1
jerked	1
off	1
his	1
feet,	1
and	1
came	1
slipping	1
and	1
sliding	1
to	1
the	1
beach,	1
and	1
into	1
the	1
surf.	1
He	1
was	1
terribly	1
angry.	1
He	1
braced	1
himself	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
might,	1
and	1
pulled	1
his	1
best.	1
At	1
the	1
jerk,	1
up	1
came	1
the	1
Whale	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
water.	1
"Who	1
is	1
pulling	1
me?"	1
spouted	1
the	1
Whale.	1
"Who	1
is	1
pulling	1
me?"	1
trumpeted	1
the	1
Elephant.	1
And	1
then	1
each	1
saw	1
the	1
rope	1
in	1
the	1
other's	1
hold.	1
"I'll	1
teach	1
you	1
to	1
play	1
cow!"	1
roared	1
the	1
Elephant.	1
"I'll	1
show	1
you	1
how	1
to	1
fool	1
me!"	1
fumed	1
the	1
Whale.	1
And	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
pull	1
again.	1
But	1
this	1
time	1
the	1
rope	1
broke,	1
the	1
Whale	1
turned	1
a	1
somersault,	1
and	1
the	1
Elephant	1
fell	1
over	1
backward.	1
At	1
that,	1
they	1
were	1
both	1
so	1
ashamed	1
that	1
neither	1
would	1
speak	1
to	1
the	1
other.	1
So	1
that	1
broke	1
up	1
the	1
bargain	1
between	1
them.	1
And	1
little	1
Brother	1
Rabbit	1
sat	1
in	1
the	1
bushes	1
and	1
laughed,	1
and	1
laughed,	1
and	1
laughed.	1
THE	1
LITTLE	1
HALF-CHICK	1
There	1
was	1
once	1
upon	1
a	1
time	1
a	1
Spanish	1
Hen,	1
who	1
hatched	1
out	1
some	1
nice	1
little	1
chickens.	1
She	1
was	1
much	1
pleased	1
with	1
their	1
looks	1
as	1
they	1
came	1
from	1
the	1
shell.	1
One,	1
two,	1
three,	1
came	1
out	1
plump	1
and	1
fluffy;	1
but	1
when	1
the	1
fourth	1
shell	1
broke,	1
out	1
came	1
a	1
little	1
half-chick!	1
It	1
had	1
only	1
one	1
leg	1
and	1
one	1
wing	1
and	1
one	1
eye!	1
It	1
was	1
just	1
half	1
a	1
chicken.	1
The	1
Hen-mother	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
the	1
queer	1
little	1
Half-Chick.	1
She	1
was	1
afraid	1
something	1
would	1
happen	1
to	1
it,	1
and	1
she	1
tried	1
hard	1
to	1
protect	1
it	1
and	1
keep	1
it	1
from	1
harm.	1
But	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
it	1
could	1
walk	1
the	1
little	1
Half-Chick	1
showed	1
a	1
most	1
headstrong	1
spirit,	1
worse	1
than	1
any	1
of	1
its	1
brothers.	1
It	1
would	1
not	1
mind,	1
and	1
it	1
would	1
go	1
wherever	1
it	1
wanted	1
to;	1
it	1
walked	1
with	1
a	1
funny	1
little	1
hoppity-kick,	1
hoppity-kick,	1
and	1
got	1
along	1
pretty	1
fast.	1
One	1
day	1
the	1
little	1
Half-Chick	1
said,	1
"Mother,	1
I	1
am	1
off	1
to	1
Madrid,	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
King!	1
Good-bye."	1
The	1
poor	1
Hen-mother	1
did	1
everything	1
she	1
could	1
think	1
of	1
to	1
keep	1
him	1
from	1
doing	1
so	1
foolish	1
a	1
thing,	1
but	1
the	1
little	1
Half-Chick	1
laughed	1
at	1
her	1
naughtily.	1
"I'm	1
for	1
seeing	1
the	1
King,"	1
he	1
said;	1
"this	1
life	1
is	1
too	1
quiet	1
for	1
me."	1
And	1
away	1
he	1
went,	1
hoppity-kick,	1
hoppity-kick,	1
over	1
the	1
fields.	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
gone	1
some	1
distance	1
the	1
little	1
Half-Chick	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
little	1
brook	1
that	1
was	1
caught	1
in	1
the	1
weeds	1
and	1
in	1
much	1
trouble.	1
"Little	1
Half-Chick,"	1
whispered	1
the	1
Water,	1
"I	1
am	1
so	1
choked	1
with	1
these	1
weeds	1
that	1
I	1
cannot	1
move;	1
I	1
am	1
almost	1
lost,	1
for	1
want	1
of	1
room;	1
please	1
push	1
the	1
sticks	1
and	1
weeds	1
away	1
with	1
your	1
bill	1
and	1
help	1
me."	1
"The	1
idea!"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
Half-Chick.	1
"I	1
cannot	1
be	1
bothered	1
with	1
you;	1
I	1
am	1
off	1
to	1
Madrid,	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
King!"	1
And	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
brook's	1
begging,	1
he	1
went	1
away,	1
hoppity-kick,	1
hoppity-kick.	1
A	1
bit	1
farther	1
on,	1
the	1
Half-Chick	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
Fire,	1
which	1
was	1
smothered	1
in	1
damp	1
sticks	1
and	1
in	1
great	1
distress.	1
"Oh,	1
little	1
Half-Chick,"	1
said	1
the	1
Fire,	1
"you	1
are	1
just	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
save	1
me.	1
I	1
am	1
almost	1
dead	1
for	1
want	1
of	1
air.	1
Fan	1
me	1
a	1
little	1
with	1
your	1
wing,	1
I	1
beg."	1
"The	1
idea!"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
Half-Chick.	1
"I	1
cannot	1
be	1
bothered	1
with	1
you;	1
I	1
am	1
off	1
to	1
Madrid,	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
King!"	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
laughing	1
off,	1
hoppity-kick,	1
hoppity-kick.	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
hoppity-kicked	1
a	1
good	1
way,	1
and	1
was	1
near	1
Madrid,	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
clump	1
of	1
bushes,	1
where	1
the	1
Wind	1
was	1
caught	1
fast.	1
The	1
Wind	1
was	1
whimpering,	1
and	1
begging	1
to	1
be	1
set	1
free.	1
"Little	1
Half-Chick,"	1
said	1
the	1
Wind,	1
"you	1
are	1
just	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
help	1
me;	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
brush	1
aside	1
these	1
twigs	1
and	1
leaves,	1
I	1
can	1
get	1
my	1
breath;	1
help	1
me,	1
quickly!"	1
"Ho!	1
the	1
idea!"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
Half-Chick	1
"I	1
have	1
no	1
time	1
to	1
bother	1
with	1
you.	1
I	1
am	1
going	1
to	1
Madrid,	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
King."	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
off,	1
hoppity-kick,	1
hoppity-kick,	1
leaving	1
the	1
Wind	1
to	1
smother.	1
After	1
a	1
while	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
Madrid	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
palace	1
of	1
the	1
King.	1
Hoppity-kick,	1
hoppity-kick,	1
the	1
little	1
Half-Chick	1
skipped	1
past	1
the	1
sentry	1
at	1
the	1
gate,	1
and	1
hoppity-kick,	1
hoppity-kick,	1
he	1
crossed	1
the	1
court.	1
But	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
passing	1
the	1
windows	1
of	1
the	1
kitchen	1
the	1
Cook	1
looked	1
out	1
and	1
saw	1
him.	1
"The	1
very	1
thing	1
for	1
the	1
King's	1
dinner!"	1
she	1
said.	1
"I	1
was	1
needing	1
a	1
chicken!"	1
And	1
she	1
seized	1
the	1
little	1
Half-Chick	1
by	1
his	1
one	1
wing	1
and	1
threw	1
him	1
into	1
a	1
kettle	1
of	1
water	1
on	1
the	1
fire.	1
The	1
Water	1
came	1
over	1
the	1
little	1
Half-Chick's	1
feathers,	1
over	1
his	1
head,	1
into	1
his	1
eyes.	1
It	1
was	1
terribly	1
uncomfortable.	1
The	1
little	1
Half-Chick	1
cried	1
out,--	1
"Water,	1
don't	1
drown	1
me!	1
Stay	1
down,	1
don't	1
come	1
so	1
high!"	1
"But,"	1
the	1
Water	1
said,	1
"Little	1
Half-Chick,	1
little	1
Half-Chick,	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
trouble	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
help	1
me,"	1
and	1
came	1
higher	1
than	1
ever.	1
Now	1
the	1
Water	1
grew	1
warm,	1
hot,	1
hotter,	1
frightfully	1
hot;	1
the	1
little	1
Half-Chick	1
cried	1
out,	1
"Do	1
not	1
burn	1
so	1
hot,	1
Fire!	1
You	1
are	1
burning	1
me	1
to	1
death!	1
Stop!"	1
But	1
the	1
Fire	1
said,	1
"Little	1
Half-Chick,	1
little	1
Half-Chick,	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
trouble	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
help	1
me,"	1
and	1
burned	1
hotter	1
than	1
ever.	1
Just	1
as	1
the	1
little	1
Half-Chick	1
thought	1
he	1
must	1
suffocate,	1
the	1
Cook	1
took	1
the	1
cover	1
off,	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
dinner.	1
"Dear	1
me,"	1
she	1
said,	1
"this	1
chicken	1
is	1
no	1
good;	1
it	1
is	1
burned	1
to	1
a	1
cinder."	1
And	1
she	1
picked	1
the	1
little	1
Half-Chick	1
up	1
by	1
one	1
leg	1
and	1
threw	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window.	1
In	1
the	1
air	1
he	1
was	1
caught	1
by	1
a	1
breeze	1
and	1
taken	1
up	1
higher	1
than	1
the	1
trees.	1
Round	1
and	1
round	1
he	1
was	1
twirled	1
till	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
dizzy	1
he	1
thought	1
he	1
must	1
perish.	1
"Don't	1
blow	1
me	1
so,	1
Wind,"	1
he	1
cried,	1
"let	1
me	1
down!"	1
"Little	1
Half-Chick,	1
little	1
Half-Chick,"	1
said	1
the	1
Wind,	1
"when	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
trouble	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
help	1
me!"	1
And	1
the	1
Wind	1
blew	1
him	1
straight	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
steeple,	1
and	1
stuck	1
him	1
there,	1
fast!	1
There	1
he	1
stands	1
to	1
this	1
day,	1
with	1
his	1
one	1
eye,	1
his	1
one	1
wing,	1
and	1
his	1
one	1
leg.	1
He	1
cannot	1
hoppity-kick	1
any	1
more,	1
but	1
he	1
turns	1
slowly	1
round	1
when	1
the	1
wind	1
blows,	1
and	1
keeps	1
his	1
head	1
toward	1
it,	1
to	1
hear	1
what	1
it	1
says.	1
THE	1
BLACKBERRY-BUSH	1
A	1
little	1
boy	1
sat	1
at	1
his	1
mother's	1
knees,	1
by	1
the	1
long	1
western	1
window,	1
looking	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
garden.	1
It	1
was	1
autumn,	1
and	1
the	1
wind	1
was	1
sad;	1
and	1
the	1
golden	1
elm	1
leaves	1
lay	1
scattered	1
about	1
among	1
the	1
grass,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
gravel	1
path.	1
The	1
mother	1
was	1
knitting	1
a	1
little	1
stocking;	1
her	1
fingers	1
moved	1
the	1
bright	1
needles;	1
but	1
her	1
eyes	1
were	1
fixed	1
on	1
the	1
clear	1
evening	1
sky.	1
As	1
the	1
darkness	1
gathered,	1
the	1
wee	1
boy	1
laid	1
his	1
head	1
on	1
her	1
lap	1
and	1
kept	1
so	1
still	1
that,	1
at	1
last,	1
she	1
leaned	1
forward	1
to	1
look	1
into	1
his	1
dear	1
round	1
face.	1
He	1
was	1
not	1
asleep,	1
but	1
was	1
watching	1
very	1
earnestly	1
a	1
blackberry-bush,	1
that	1
waved	1
its	1
one	1
tall,	1
dark-red	1
spray	1
in	1
the	1
wind	1
outside	1
the	1
fence.	1
"What	1
are	1
you	1
thinking	1
about,	1
my	1
darling?"	1
she	1
said,	1
smoothing	1
his	1
soft,	1
honey-coloured	1
hair.	1
"The	1
blackberry-bush,	1
mamma;	1
what	1
does	1
it	1
say?	1
It	1
keeps	1
nodding,	1
nodding	1
to	1
me	1
behind	1
the	1
fence;	1
what	1
does	1
it	1
say,	1
mamma?"	1
"It	1
says,"	1
she	1
answered,	1
"'I	1
see	1
a	1
happy	1
little	1
boy	1
in	1
the	1
warm,	1
fire-lighted	1
room.	1
The	1
wind	1
blows	1
cold,	1
and	1
here	1
it	1
is	1
dark	1
and	1
lonely;	1
but	1
that	1
little	1
boy	1
is	1
warm	1
and	1
happy	1
and	1
safe	1
at	1
his	1
mother's	1
knees.	1
I	1
nod	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
looks	1
at	1
me.	1
I	1
wonder	1
if	1
he	1
knows	1
how	1
happy	1
he	1
is!	1
"'See,	1
all	1
my	1
leaves	1
are	1
dark	1
crimson.	1
Every	1
day	1
they	1
dry	1
and	1
wither	1
more	1
and	1
more;	1
by	1
and	1
by	1
they	1
will	1
be	1
so	1
weak	1
they	1
can	1
scarcely	1
cling	1
to	1
my	1
branches,	1
and	1
the	1
north	1
wind	1
will	1
tear	1
them	1
all	1
away,	1
and	1
nobody	1
will	1
remember	1
them	1
any	1
more.	1
Then	1
the	1
snow	1
will	1
sink	1
down	1
and	1
wrap	1
me	1
close.	1
Then	1
the	1
snow	1
will	1
melt	1
again	1
and	1
icy	1
rain	1
will	1
clothe	1
me,	1
and	1
the	1
bitter	1
wind	1
will	1
rattle	1
my	1
bare	1
twigs	1
up	1
and	1
down.	1
"'I	1
nod	1
my	1
head	1
to	1
all	1
who	1
pass,	1
and	1
dreary	1
nights	1
and	1
dreary	1
days	1
go	1
by;	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
happy	1
house,	1
so	1
warm	1
and	1
bright,	1
the	1
little	1
boy	1
plays	1
all	1
day	1
with	1
books	1
and	1
toys.	1
His	1
mother	1
and	1
his	1
father	1
cherish	1
him;	1
he	1
nestles	1
on	1
their	1
knees	1
in	1
the	1
red	1
firelight	1
at	1
night,	1
while	1
they	1
read	1
to	1
him	1
lovely	1
stories,	1
or	1
sing	1
sweet	1
old	1
songs	1
to	1
him,--the	1
happy	1
little	1
boy!	1
And	1
outside	1
I	1
peep	1
over	1
the	1
snow	1
and	1
see	1
a	1
stream	1
of	1
ruddy	1
light	1
from	1
a	1
crack	1
in	1
the	1
window-shutter,	1
and	1
I	1
nod	1
out	1
here	1
alone	1
in	1
the	1
dark,	1
thinking	1
how	1
beautiful	1
it	1
is.	1
"'And	1
here	1
I	1
wait	1
patiently.	1
I	1
take	1
the	1
snow	1
and	1
the	1
rain	1
and	1
the	1
cold,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
sorry,	1
but	1
glad;	1
for	1
in	1
my	1
roots	1
I	1
feel	1
warmth	1
and	1
life,	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
a	1
store	1
of	1
greenness	1
and	1
beauty	1
is	1
shut	1
up	1
safe	1
in	1
my	1
small	1
brown	1
buds.	1
Day	1
and	1
night	1
go	1
again	1
and	1
again;	1
little	1
by	1
little	1
the	1
snow	1
melts	1
all	1
away;	1
the	1
ground	1
grows	1
soft;	1
the	1
sky	1
is	1
blue;	1
the	1
little	1
birds	1
fly	1
over,	1
crying,	1
"It	1
is	1
spring!	1
it	1
is	1
spring!"	1
Ah!	1
then	1
through	1
all	1
my	1
twigs	1
I	1
feel	1
the	1
slow	1
sap	1
stirring.	1
"'Warmer	1
grow	1
the	1
sunbeams,	1
and	1
softer	1
the	1
air.	1
The	1
small	1
blades	1
of	1
grass	1
creep	1
thick	1
about	1
my	1
feet;	1
the	1
sweet	1
rain	1
helps	1
to	1
swell	1
my	1
shining	1
buds.	1
More	1
and	1
more	1
I	1
push	1
forth	1
my	1
leaves,	1
till	1
out	1
I	1
burst	1
in	1
a	1
gay	1
green	1
dress,	1
and	1
nod	1
in	1
joy	1
and	1
pride.	1
The	1
little	1
boy	1
comes	1
running	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
me,	1
and	1
cries,	1
"Oh,	1
mamma!	1
the	1
little	1
blackberry-bush	1
is	1
alive	1
and	1
beautiful	1
and	1
green.	1
Oh,	1
come	1
and	1
see!"	1
And	1
I	1
hear;	1
and	1
I	1
bow	1
my	1
head	1
in	1
the	1
summer	1
wind;	1
and	1
every	1
day	1
they	1
watch	1
me	1
grow	1
more	1
beautiful,	1
till	1
at	1
last	1
I	1
shake	1
out	1
blossoms,	1
fair	1
and	1
fragrant.	1
"'A	1
few	1
days	1
more,	1
and	1
I	1
drop	1
the	1
white	1
petals	1
down	1
among	1
the	1
grass,	1
and,	1
lo!	1
there	1
are	1
the	1
green	1
tiny	1
berries!	1
Carefully	1
I	1
hold	1
them	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
sun;	1
carefully	1
I	1
gather	1
the	1
dew	1
in	1
the	1
summer	1
nights;	1
slowly	1
they	1
ripen;	1
they	1
grow	1
larger	1
and	1
redder	1
and	1
darker,	1
and	1
at	1
last	1
they	1
are	1
black,	1
shining,	1
delicious.	1
I	1
hold	1
them	1
as	1
high	1
as	1
I	1
can	1
for	1
the	1
little	1
boy,	1
who	1
comes	1
dancing	1
out.	1
He	1
shouts	1
with	1
joy,	1
and	1
gathers	1
them	1
in	1
his	1
dear	1
hand;	1
and	1
he	1
runs	1
to	1
share	1
them	1
with	1
his	1
mother,	1
saying,	1
"Here	1
is	1
what	1
the	1
patient	1
blackberry-bush	1
bore	1
for	1
us:	1
see	1
how	1
nice,	1
mamma!"	1
"'Ah!	1
then	1
indeed	1
I	1
am	1
glad,	1
and	1
would	1
say,	1
if	1
I	1
could,	1
"Yes,	1
take	1
them,	1
dear	1
little	1
boy;	1
I	1
kept	1
them	1
for	1
you,	1
held	1
them	1
long	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
sun	1
and	1
rain	1
to	1
make	1
them	1
sweet	1
and	1
ripe	1
for	1
you";	1
and	1
I	1
nod	1
and	1
nod	1
in	1
full	1
content,	1
for	1
my	1
work	1
is	1
done.	1
From	1
the	1
window	1
he	1
watches	1
me	1
and	1
thinks,	1
"There	1
is	1
the	1
little	1
blackberry-bush	1
that	1
was	1
so	1
kind	1
to	1
me.	1
I	1
see	1
it	1
and	1
I	1
love	1
it.	1
I	1
know	1
it	1
is	1
safe	1
out	1
there	1
nodding	1
all	1
alone,	1
and	1
next	1
summer	1
it	1
will	1
hold	1
ripe	1
berries	1
up	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
gather	1
again."'"	1

Then	1
the	1
wee	1
boy	1
smiled,	1
and	1
said	1
he	1
liked	1
the	1
little	1
story.	1
His	1
mother	1
took	1
him	1
up	1
in	1
her	1
arms,	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
supper	1
and	1
left	1
the	1
blackberry-bush	1
nodding	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
wind;	1
and	1
there	1
it	1
is	1
nodding	1
yet.	1

Down	1

All	1

High	1
on	1
the	1
hilltop	1
The	1
old	1
King	1
sits;	1
He	1
is	1
now	1
so	1
old	1
and	1
gray,	1
He's	1
nigh	1
lost	1
his	1
wits.	1
With	1
a	1

long;	1
When	1
she	1
came	1
down	1
again	1
Her	1

were	1
all	1
gone.	1
They	1
took	1
her	1
lightly	1
back,	1
Between	1
the	1
night	1
and	1
morrow;	1
They	1
thought	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
fast	1
asleep,	1
But	1
she	1
was	1
dead	1
with	1
sorrow.	1
They	1
have	1
kept	1
her	1
ever	1
since	1
Deep	1
within	1
the	1
lake,	1
On	1
a	1
bed	1
of	1
flag-leaves,	1
Watching	1
till	1
she	1
wake.	1
By	1
the	1
craggy	1
hillside,	1
Through	1
the	1
mosses	1
bare,	1
They	1
have	1
planted	1
thorn-trees,	1
For	1
pleasure	1
here	1
and	1
there.	1
Is	1
any	1
man	1
so	1
daring	1
As	1
dig	1
them	1
up	1
in	1
spite,	1
He	1
shall	1
find	1
their	1

In	1

THE	1
ADVENTURES	1
OF	1
THE	1
LITTLE	1
FIELD	1
MOUSE	1
Once	1
upon	1
a	1
time,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
brown	1
Field	1
Mouse;	1
and	1
one	1
day	1
he	1
was	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
fields	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
he	1
could	1
find.	1
He	1
was	1
running	1
along	1
in	1
the	1
grass,	1
poking	1
his	1
nose	1
into	1
everything	1
and	1
looking	1
with	1
his	1
two	1
eyes	1
all	1
about,	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
a	1
smooth,	1
shiny	1
acorn,	1
lying	1
in	1
the	1
grass.	1
It	1
was	1
such	1
a	1
fine	1
shiny	1
little	1
acorn	1
that	1
he	1
thought	1
he	1
would	1
take	1
it	1
home	1
with	1
him;	1
so	1
he	1
put	1
out	1
his	1
paw	1
to	1
touch	1
it,	1
but	1
the	1
little	1
acorn	1
rolled	1
away	1
from	1
him.	1
He	1
ran	1
after	1
it,	1
but	1
it	1
kept	1
rolling	1
on,	1
just	1
ahead	1
of	1
him,	1
till	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
place	1
where	1
a	1
big	1
oak-tree	1
had	1
its	1
roots	1
spread	1
all	1
over	1
the	1
ground.	1
Then	1
it	1
rolled	1
under	1
a	1
big	1
round	1
root.	1
Little	1
Mr	1
Field	1
Mouse	1
ran	1
to	1
the	1
root	1
and	1
poked	1
his	1
nose	1
under	1
after	1
the	1
acorn,	1
and	1
there	1
he	1
saw	1
a	1
small	1
round	1
hole	1
in	1
the	1
ground.	1
He	1
slipped	1
through	1
and	1
saw	1
some	1
stairs	1
going	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
earth.	1
The	1
acorn	1
was	1
rolling	1
down,	1
with	1
a	1
soft	1
tapping	1
sound,	1
ahead	1
of	1
him,	1
so	1
down	1
he	1
went	1
too.	1
Down,	1
down,	1
down,	1
rolled	1
the	1
acorn,	1
and	1
down,	1
down,	1
down,	1
went	1
the	1
Field	1
Mouse,	1
until	1
suddenly	1
he	1
saw	1
a	1
tiny	1
door	1
at	1
the	1
foot	1
of	1
the	1
stairs.	1
The	1
shiny	1
acorn	1
rolled	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
struck	1
against	1
it	1
with	1
a	1
tap.	1
Quickly	1
the	1
little	1
door	1
opened	1
and	1
the	1
acorn	1
rolled	1
inside.	1
The	1
Field	1
Mouse	1
hurried	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
down	1
the	1
last	1
stairs,	1
and	1
pushed	1
through	1
just	1
as	1
the	1
door	1
was	1
closing.	1
It	1
shut	1
behind	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
little	1
room.	1
And	1
there,	1
before	1
him,	1
stood	1
a	1
queer	1
little	1
Red	1
Man!	1
He	1
had	1
a	1
little	1
red	1
cap,	1
and	1
a	1
little	1
red	1
jacket,	1
and	1
odd	1
little	1
red	1
shoes	1
with	1
points	1
at	1
the	1
toes.	1
"You	1
are	1
my	1
prisoner,"	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
Field	1
Mouse.	1
"What	1
for?"	1
said	1
the	1
Field	1
Mouse.	1
"Because	1
you	1
tried	1
to	1
steal	1
my	1
acorn,"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
Red	1
Man.	1
"It	1
is	1
my	1
acorn,"	1
said	1
the	1
Field	1
Mouse;	1
"I	1
found	1
it."	1
"No,	1
it	1
isn't,"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
Red	1
Man,	1
"I	1
have	1
it;	1
you	1
will	1
never	1
see	1
it	1
again."	1
The	1
little	1
Field	1
Mouse	1
looked	1
all	1
about	1
the	1
room	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
he	1
could,	1
but	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
any	1
acorn.	1
Then	1
he	1
thought	1
he	1
would	1
go	1
back	1
up	1
the	1
tiny	1
stairs	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
home.	1
But	1
the	1
little	1
door	1
was	1
locked,	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
Red	1
Man	1
had	1
the	1
key.	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
poor	1
mouse,--	1
"You	1
shall	1
be	1
my	1
servant;	1
you	1
shall	1
make	1
my	1
bed	1
and	1
sweep	1
my	1
room	1
and	1
cook	1
my	1
broth."	1
So	1
the	1
little	1
brown	1
Mouse	1
was	1
the	1
little	1
Red	1
Man's	1
servant,	1
and	1
every	1
day	1
he	1
made	1
the	1
little	1
Red	1
Man's	1
bed	1
and	1
swept	1
the	1
little	1
Red	1
Man's	1
room	1
and	1
cooked	1
the	1
little	1
Red	1
Man's	1
broth.	1
And	1
every	1
day	1
the	1
little	1
Red	1
Man	1
went	1
away	1
through	1
the	1
tiny	1
door,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
come	1
back	1
till	1
afternoon.	1
But	1
he	1
always	1
locked	1
the	1
door	1
after	1
him,	1
and	1
carried	1
away	1
the	1
key.	1
At	1
last,	1
one	1
day	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
hurry	1
that	1
he	1
turned	1
the	1
key	1
before	1
the	1
door	1
was	1
quite	1
latched,	1
which,	1
of	1
course,	1
didn't	1
lock	1
it	1
at	1
all.	1
He	1
went	1
away	1
without	1
noticing,--he	1
was	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
hurry.	1
The	1
little	1
Field	1
Mouse	1
knew	1
that	1
his	1
chance	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
run	1
away	1
home.	1
But	1
he	1
didn't	1
want	1
to	1
go	1
without	1
the	1
pretty,	1
shiny	1
acorn.	1
Where	1
it	1
was	1
he	1
didn't	1
know,	1
so	1
he	1
looked	1
everywhere.	1
He	1
opened	1
every	1
little	1
drawer	1
and	1
looked	1
in,	1
but	1
it	1
wasn't	1
in	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
drawers;	1
he	1
peeped	1
on	1
every	1
shelf,	1
but	1
it	1
wasn't	1
on	1
a	1
shelf;	1
he	1
hunted	1
in	1
every	1
closet,	1
but	1
it	1
wasn't	1
in	1
there.	1
Finally,	1
he	1
climbed	1
up	1
on	1
a	1
chair	1
and	1
opened	1
a	1
wee,	1
wee	1
door	1
in	1
the	1
chimney-piece,--and	1
there	1
it	1
was!	1
He	1
took	1
it	1
quickly	1
in	1
his	1
forepaws,	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
took	1
it	1
in	1
his	1
mouth,	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
ran	1
away.	1
He	1
pushed	1
open	1
the	1
little	1
door;	1
he	1
climbed	1
up,	1
up,	1
up	1
the	1
little	1
stairs;	1
he	1
came	1
out	1
through	1
the	1
hole	1
under	1
the	1
root;	1
he	1
ran	1
and	1
ran	1
through	1
the	1
fields;	1
and	1
at	1
last	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
house.	1
When	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
house	1
he	1
set	1
the	1
shiny	1
acorn	1
on	1
the	1
table.	1
I	1
expect	1
he	1
set	1
it	1
down	1
hard,	1
for	1
all	1
at	1
once,	1
with	1
a	1
little	1
snap,	1
it	1
opened!--exactly	1
like	1
a	1
little	1
box.	1
And	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
think!	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
tiny	1
necklace	1
inside!	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
most	1
beautiful	1
tiny	1
necklace,	1
all	1
made	1
of	1
jewels,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
just	1
big	1
enough	1
for	1
a	1
lady	1
mouse.	1
So	1
the	1
little	1
Field	1
Mouse	1
gave	1
the	1
tiny	1
necklace	1
to	1
his	1
little	1
Mouse-sister.	1
She	1
thought	1
it	1
was	1
perfectly	1
lovely.	1
And	1
when	1
she	1
wasn't	1
wearing	1
it	1
she	1
kept	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
shiny	1
acorn	1
box.	1
And	1
the	1
little	1
Red	1
Man	1
never	1
knew	1
what	1
had	1
become	1
of	1
it,	1
because	1
he	1
didn't	1
know	1
where	1
the	1
little	1
Field	1
Mouse	1
lived.	1
ANOTHER	1
LITTLE	1
RED	1
HEN	1
Once	1
upon	1
a	1
time	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
Red	1
Hen,	1
who	1
lived	1
on	1
a	1
farm	1
all	1
by	1
herself.	1
An	1
old	1
Fox,	1
crafty	1
and	1
sly,	1
had	1
a	1
den	1
in	1
the	1
rocks,	1
on	1
a	1
hill	1
near	1
her	1
house.	1
Many	1
and	1
many	1
a	1
night	1
this	1
old	1
Fox	1
used	1
to	1
lie	1
awake	1
and	1
think	1
to	1
himself	1
how	1
good	1
that	1
little	1
Red	1
Hen	1
would	1
taste	1
if	1
he	1
could	1
once	1
get	1
her	1
in	1
his	1
big	1
kettle	1
and	1
boil	1
her	1
for	1
dinner.	1
But	1
he	1
couldn't	1
catch	1
the	1
little	1
Red	1
Hen,	1
because	1
she	1
was	1
too	1
wise	1
for	1
him.	1
Every	1
time	1
she	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
market	1
she	1
locked	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
behind	1
her,	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
came	1
in	1
again	1
she	1
locked	1
the	1
door	1
behind	1
her	1
and	1
put	1
the	1
key	1
in	1
her	1
apron	1
pocket,	1
where	1
she	1
kept	1
her	1
scissors	1
and	1
some	1
sugar	1
candy.	1
At	1
last	1
the	1
old	1
Fox	1
thought	1
out	1
a	1
way	1
to	1
catch	1
the	1
little	1
Red	1
Hen.	1
Early	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
his	1
old	1
mother,	1
"Have	1
the	1
kettle	1
boiling	1
when	1
I	1
come	1
home	1
to-night,	1
for	1
I'll	1
be	1
bringing	1
the	1
little	1
Red	1
Hen	1
for	1
supper."	1
Then	1
he	1
took	1
a	1
big	1
bag	1
and	1
slung	1
it	1
over	1
his	1
shoulder,	1
and	1
walked	1
till	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
little	1
Red	1
Hen's	1
house.	1
The	1
little	1
Red	1
Hen	1
was	1
just	1
coming	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
door	1
to	1
pick	1
up	1
a	1
few	1
sticks	1
for	1
firewood.	1
So	1
the	1
old	1
Fox	1
hid	1
behind	1
the	1
wood-pile,	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
bent	1
down	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
stick,	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
he	1
slipped,	1
and	1
scurried	1
behind	1
the	1
door.	1
In	1
a	1
minute	1
the	1
little	1
Red	1
Hen	1
came	1
quickly	1
in,	1
and	1
shut	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
locked	1
it.	1
"I'm	1
glad	1
I'm	1
safely	1
in,"	1
she	1
said.	1
Just	1
as	1
she	1
said	1
it,	1
she	1
turned	1
round,	1
and	1
there	1
stood	1
the	1
ugly	1
old	1
Fox,	1
with	1
his	1
big	1
bag	1
over	1
his	1
shoulder.	1
Whiff!	1
how	1
scared	1
the	1
little	1
Red	1
Hen	1
was!	1
She	1
dropped	1
her	1
apronful	1
of	1
sticks,	1
and	1
flew	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
big	1
beam	1
across	1
the	1
ceiling.	1
There	1
she	1
perched,	1
and	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
Fox,	1
down	1
below,	1
"You	1
may	1
as	1
well	1
go	1
home,	1
for	1
you	1
can't	1
get	1
me."	1
"Can't	1
I,	1
though!"	1
said	1
the	1
Fox.	1
And	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
he	1
did?	1
He	1
stood	1
on	1
the	1
floor	1
underneath	1
the	1
little	1
Red	1
Hen	1
and	1
twirled	1
round	1
in	1
a	1
circle	1
after	1
his	1
own	1
tail.	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
spun,	1
and	1
spun,	1
and	1
spun,	1
faster,	1
and	1
faster,	1
and	1
faster,	1
the	1
poor	1
little	1
Red	1
Hen	1
got	1
so	1
dizzy	1
watching	1
him	1
that	1
she	1
couldn't	1
hold	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
perch.	1
She	1
dropped	1
off,	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
Fox	1
picked	1
her	1
up	1
and	1
put	1
her	1
in	1
his	1
bag,	1
slung	1
the	1
bag	1
over	1
his	1
shoulder,	1
and	1
started	1
for	1
home,	1
where	1
the	1
kettle	1
was	1
boiling.	1
He	1
had	1
a	1
very	1
long	1
way	1
to	1
go,	1
up	1
hill,	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
Red	1
Hen	1
was	1
still	1
so	1
dizzy	1
that	1
she	1
didn't	1
know	1
where	1
she	1
was.	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
dizziness	1
began	1
to	1
go	1
off,	1
she	1
whisked	1
her	1
little	1
scissors	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
apron	1
pocket,	1
and	1
snip!	1
she	1
cut	1
a	1
little	1
hole	1
in	1
the	1
bag;	1
then	1
she	1
poked	1
her	1
head	1
out	1
and	1
saw	1
where	1
she	1
was,	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
good	1
spot	1
she	1
cut	1
the	1
hole	1
bigger	1
and	1
jumped	1
out	1
herself.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
big	1
stone	1
lying	1
there,	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
Red	1
Hen	1
picked	1
it	1
up	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
bag	1
as	1
quick	1
as	1
a	1
wink.	1
Then	1
she	1
ran	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
she	1
could	1
till	1
she	1
came	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
little	1
farmhouse,	1
and	1
she	1
went	1
in	1
and	1
locked	1
the	1
door	1
with	1
the	1
big	1
key.	1
The	1
old	1
Fox	1
went	1
on	1
carrying	1
the	1
stone	1
and	1
never	1
knew	1
the	1
difference.	1
My,	1
but	1
it	1
bumped	1
him	1
well!	1
He	1
was	1
pretty	1
tired	1
when	1
he	1
got	1
home.	1
But	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
pleased	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
the	1
supper	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
have	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
mind	1
that	1
at	1
all.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
his	1
mother	1
opened	1
the	1
door	1
he	1
said,	1
"Is	1
the	1
kettle	1
boiling?"	1
"Yes,"	1
said	1
his	1
mother;	1
"have	1
you	1
got	1
the	1
little	1
Red	1
Hen?"	1
"I	1
have,"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
Fox.	1
"When	1
I	1
open	1
the	1
bag	1
you	1
hold	1
the	1
cover	1
off	1
the	1
kettle	1
and	1
I'll	1
shake	1
the	1
bag	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
Hen	1
will	1
fall	1
in,	1
and	1
then	1
you	1
pop	1
the	1
cover	1
on,	1
before	1
she	1
can	1
jump	1
out."	1
"All	1
right,"	1
said	1
his	1
mean	1
old	1
mother;	1
and	1
she	1
stood	1
close	1
by	1
the	1
boiling	1
kettle,	1
ready	1
to	1
put	1
the	1
cover	1
on.	1
The	1
Fox	1
lifted	1
the	1
big,	1
heavy	1
bag	1
up	1
till	1
it	1
was	1
over	1
the	1
open	1
kettle,	1
and	1
gave	1
it	1
a	1
shake.	1
Splash!	1
thump!	1
splash!	1
In	1
went	1
the	1
stone	1
and	1
out	1
came	1
the	1
boiling	1
water,	1
all	1
over	1
the	1
old	1
Fox	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
Fox's	1
mother!	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
scalded	1
to	1
death.	1
But	1
the	1
little	1
Red	1
Hen	1
lived	1
happily	1
ever	1
after,	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
little	1
farmhouse.	1

Ould	1

This	1

He	1
tuk	1
it	1
in	1
his	1
head	1
He'd	1
have	1
the	1
little	1
Rid	1
Hin:	1
So,	1
whin	1
he	1
wint	1
to	1
bed,	1
He	1
laid	1
awake	1
and	1
thaught	1
What	1
a	1
foine	1
thing	1
'twad	1

To	1
fetch	1
her	1
home	1
and	1
bile	1
her	1
up	1
For	1
his	1
ould	1
marm	1
and	1
he.	1
And	1
so	1
he	1
thaught	1
and	1
thaught,	1
Until	1
he	1
grew	1
so	1
thin	1
That	1
there	1
was	1
nothin'	1
left	1
of	1
him	1
But	1
jist	1
his	1
bones	1
and	1
shkin.	1
But	1
the	1
small	1
Rid	1
Hin	1
was	1
wise,	1
She	1
always	1
locked	1
her	1
door,	1
And	1
in	1
her	1
pocket	1
pit	1
the	1
key,	1
To	1
keep	1
the	1
Fox	1
out	1
shure.	1
But	1
at	1
last	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
schame	1
Intil	1
his	1
wicked	1
head,	1
And	1
he	1
tuk	1
a	1
great	1
big	1

And	1
to	1
his	1
mither	1
said,--	1
"Now	1

Agin	1

We'll	1

the	1
small	1
Rid	1
Hin	1
to-night,	1
For	1
shure	1
I'll	1
bring	1
her	1
home."	1
And	1
so	1
away	1
he	1
wint	1
Wid	1
the	1
bag	1
upon	1
his	1
back,	1
An'	1
up	1
the	1
hill	1
and	1
through	1
the	1
woods	1
Saftly	1
he	1
made	1
his	1
track.	1
An'	1
thin	1
he	1
came	1
alang,	1
Craping	1
as	1
shtill's	1
a	1
mouse,	1
To	1
where	1
the	1
little	1
small	1
Rid	1
Hin	1
Lived	1
in	1
her	1
shnug	1
ould	1
house.	1
An'	1
out	1
she	1
comes	1
hersel',	1
Jist	1
as	1
he	1
got	1
in	1
sight,	1
To	1
pick	1
up	1
shticks	1
to	1
make	1
her	1

"Aha!"	1
says	1
Fox,	1
"all	1
right.	1
"Begorra,	1
now,	1
I'll	1
have	1
yees	1
Widout	1
much	1
throuble	1

An'	1
in	1
he	1
shlips	1
quite	1
unbeknownst,	1
An'	1
hides	1
be'ind	1
the	1
door.	1
An'	1
thin,	1
a	1
minute	1
afther,	1
In	1
comes	1
the	1
small	1
Rid	1
Hin,	1
An'	1
shuts	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
locks	1
it,	1
too,	1
An'	1
thinks,	1
"I'm	1
safely	1
in."	1
An'	1
thin	1
she	1
tarns	1
around	1
An'	1
looks	1
be'ind	1
the	1
door;	1
There	1
shtands	1
the	1
Fox	1
wid	1
his	1
big	1
tail	1
Shpread	1
out	1
upon	1
the	1
floor.	1
Dear	1
me!	1
she	1
was	1
so	1
schared	1
Wid	1
such	1
a	1
wondrous	1
sight,	1
She	1
dropped	1
her	1
apronful	1
of	1
shticks,	1
An'	1
flew	1
up	1
in	1
a	1
fright,	1
An'	1
lighted	1
on	1
the	1
bame	1
Across	1
on	1
top	1
the	1
room;	1
"Aha!"	1
says	1
she,	1
"ye	1
don't	1
have	1
me;	1
Ye	1
may	1
as	1
well	1
go	1
home."	1
"Aha!"	1
says	1
Fox,	1
"we'll	1
see;	1
I'll	1
bring	1
yees	1
down	1
from	1
that."	1
So	1
out	1
he	1
marched	1
upon	1
the	1
floor	1
Right	1
under	1
where	1
she	1
sat.	1
An'	1

he	1
whiruled	1

An'	1

Fashter	1

Afther	1

on	1
the	1
ground.	1
Until	1
the	1
small	1
Rid	1
Hin	1
She	1
got	1
so	1
dizzy,	1
shure,	1
Wid	1
lookin'	1
at	1
the	1
Fox's	1
tail,	1
She	1
jist	1
dropped	1
on	1
the	1
floor.	1
An'	1
Fox	1
he	1
whipped	1
her	1
up,	1
An'	1
pit	1
her	1
in	1
his	1
bag,	1
An'	1
off	1
he	1
started	1
all	1
alone,	1
Him	1
and	1
his	1
little	1
dag.	1
All	1
day	1
he	1
tracked	1

Up	1
hill	1
an'	1
down	1
again;	1
An'	1
wid	1
him,	1
shmotherin'	1
in	1
the	1

The	1

Rid	1

Sorra	1
a	1

Awhere	1
she	1
was	1
that	1
day;	1
Says	1
she,	1
"I'm	1
biled	1
an'	1
ate	1
up,	1
shure	1
An'	1
what'll	1
be	1

Thin	1
she	1
betho't	1
hersel',	1
An'	1
tuk	1
her	1
schissors	1
out,	1
An'	1
shnipped	1
a	1
big	1
hole	1
in	1
the	1
bag,	1
So	1
she	1
could	1
look	1
about.	1
An'	1
'fore	1
ould	1
Fox	1
could	1
think	1
She	1
lept	1
right	1
out--she	1
did,	1
An'	1
thin	1
picked	1
up	1
a	1
great	1

An'	1
popped	1

An'	1
thin	1
she	1
rins	1
off	1
home,	1
Her	1
outside	1

Thinks	1
she,	1
"You	1

you	1
don't	1

You	1
crafty,	1
shly	1
ould	1

An'	1
Fox	1
he	1
tugged	1
away	1
Wid	1
the	1

shtone,	1
Thimpin'	1
his	1
shoulders	1
very	1
bad	1
As	1
he	1
wint	1
in	1

An'	1
whin	1
he	1
came	1
in	1

O'	1
his	1
great	1
din	1

Jist	1

He	1
shpied	1

"Have	1

Says	1
he	1
to	1
ould	1
Fox	1
thin;	1
"Shure	1
an'	1
it	1
is,	1
me	1
child,"	1
says	1
she;	1
"Have	1

"Yes,	1

As	1

Open	1

Open	1

So	1
the	1
rashkill	1
cut	1
the	1
shtring,	1
An'	1
hild	1
the	1

over;	1
"Now	1

"Do	1

"Yis,	1

THE	1
STORY	1
OF	1
EPAMINONDAS	1
AND	1
HIS	1
AUNTIE	1
Epaminondas	1
used	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
see	1
his	1
Auntie	1
'most	1
every	1
day,	1
and	1
she	1
nearly	1
always	1
gave	1
him	1
something	1
to	1
take	1
home	1
to	1
his	1
Mammy.	1
One	1
day	1
she	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
big	1
piece	1
of	1
cake;	1
nice,	1
yellow,	1
rich	1
gold-cake.	1
Epaminondas	1
took	1
it	1
in	1
his	1
fist	1
and	1
held	1
it	1
all	1
crunched	1
up	1
tight,	1
like	1
this,	1
and	1
came	1
along	1
home.	1
By	1
the	1
time	1
he	1
got	1
home	1
there	1
wasn't	1
anything	1
left	1
but	1
a	1
fistful	1
of	1
crumbs.	1
His	1
Mammy	1
said,--	1
"What	1
you	1
got	1
there,	1
Epaminondas?"	1
"Cake,	1
Mammy,"	1
said	1
Epaminondas.	1
"Cake!"	1
said	1
his	1
Mammy.	1
"Epaminondas,	1
you	1
ain't	1
got	1
the	1
sense	1
you	1
was	1
born	1
with!	1
That's	1
no	1
way	1
to	1
carry	1
cake.	1
The	1
way	1
to	1
carry	1
cake	1
is	1
to	1
wrap	1
it	1
all	1
up	1
nice	1
in	1
some	1
leaves	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
in	1
your	1
hat,	1
and	1
put	1
your	1
hat	1
on	1
your	1
head,	1
and	1
come	1
along	1
home.	1
You	1
hear	1
me,	1
Epaminondas?"	1
"Yes,	1
Mammy,"	1
said	1
Epaminondas.	1
Next	1
day	1
Epaminondas	1
went	1
to	1
see	1
his	1
Auntie,	1
and	1
she	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
pound	1
of	1
butter	1
for	1
his	1
Mammy;	1
fine,	1
fresh,	1
sweet	1
butter.	1
Epaminondas	1
wrapped	1
it	1
up	1
in	1
leaves	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
in	1
his	1
hat,	1
and	1
put	1
his	1
hat	1
on	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
came	1
along	1
home.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
hot	1
day.	1
Pretty	1
soon	1
the	1
butter	1
began	1
to	1
melt.	1
It	1
melted,	1
and	1
melted,	1
and	1
as	1
it	1
melted	1
it	1
ran	1
down	1
Epaminondas'	1
forehead;	1
then	1
it	1
ran	1
over	1
his	1
face,	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
ears,	1
and	1
down	1
his	1
neck.	1
When	1
he	1
got	1
home,	1
all	1
the	1
butter	1
Epaminondas	1
had	1
was	1
_on	1
him_.	1
His	1
Mammy	1
looked	1
at	1
him,	1
and	1
then	1
she	1
said,--	1
"Law's	1
sake!	1
Epaminondas,	1
what	1
you	1
got	1
in	1
your	1
hat?"	1
"Butter,	1
Mammy,"	1
said	1
Epaminondas;	1
"Auntie	1
gave	1
it	1
to	1
me."	1
"Butter!"	1
said	1
his	1
Mammy.	1
"Epaminondas,	1
you	1
ain't	1
got	1
the	1
sense	1
you	1
was	1
born	1
with!	1
Don't	1
you	1
know	1
that's	1
no	1
way	1
to	1
carry	1
butter?	1
The	1
way	1
to	1
carry	1
butter	1
is	1
to	1
wrap	1
it	1
up	1
in	1
some	1
leaves	1
and	1
take	1
it	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
brook,	1
and	1
cool	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
water,	1
and	1
cool	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
water,	1
and	1
cool	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
water,	1
and	1
then	1
take	1
it	1
on	1
your	1
hands,	1
careful,	1
and	1
bring	1
it	1
along	1
home."	1
"Yes,	1
Mammy,"	1
said	1
Epaminondas.	1
By	1
and	1
by,	1
another	1
day,	1
Epaminondas	1
went	1
to	1
see	1
his	1
Auntie	1
again,	1
and;	1
this	1
time	1
she	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
little	1
new	1
puppy-dog	1
to	1
take	1
home.	1
Epaminondas	1
put	1
it	1
in	1
some	1
leaves	1
and	1
took	1
it	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
brook;	1
and	1
there	1
he	1
cooled	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
water,	1
and	1
cooled	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
water,	1
and	1
cooled	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
water;	1
then	1
he	1
took	1
it	1
in	1
his	1
hands	1
and	1
came	1
along	1
home.	1
When	1
he	1
got	1
home,	1
the	1
puppy-dog	1
was	1
dead.	1
His	1
Mammy	1
looked	1
at	1
it,	1
and	1
she	1
said,--	1
"Law's	1
sake!	1
Epaminondas,	1
what	1
you	1
got	1
there?"	1
"A	1
puppy-dog,	1
Mammy,"	1
said	1
Epaminondas.	1
"A	1
_puppy-dog_!"	1
said	1
his	1
Mammy.	1
"My	1
gracious	1
sakes	1
alive,	1
Epaminondas,	1
you	1
ain't	1
got	1
the	1
sense	1
you	1
was	1
born	1
with!	1
That	1
ain't	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
carry	1
a	1
puppy-dog!	1
The	1
way	1
to	1
carry	1
a	1
puppy-dog	1
is	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
long	1
piece	1
of	1
string	1
and	1
tie	1
one	1
end	1
of	1
it	1
round	1
the	1
puppy-dog's	1
neck	1
and	1
put	1
the	1
puppy-dog	1
on	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
take	1
hold	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
string	1
and	1
come	1
along	1
home,	1
like	1
this."	1
"All	1
right,	1
Mammy,"	1
said	1
Epaminondas.	1
Next	1
day	1
Epaminondas	1
went	1
to	1
see	1
his	1
Auntie	1
again,	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
go	1
home	1
she	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
loaf	1
of	1
bread	1
to	1
carry	1
to	1
his	1
Mammy;	1
a	1
brown,	1
fresh,	1
crusty	1
loaf	1
of	1
bread.	1
So	1
Epaminondas	1
tied	1
a	1
string	1
around	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
loaf	1
and	1
took	1
hold	1
of	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
string	1
and	1
came	1
along	1
home,	1
like	1
this.	1
(Imitate	1
dragging	1
something	1
along	1
the	1
ground.)	1
When	1
he	1
got	1
home	1
his	1
Mammy	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
thing	1
on	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
string,	1
and	1
she	1
said,--	1
"My	1
laws	1
a-massy!	1
Epaminondas,	1
what	1
you	1
got	1
on	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
that	1
string?"	1
"Bread,	1
Mammy,"	1
said	1
Epaminondas;	1
"Auntie	1
gave	1
it	1
to	1
me."	1
"Bread!!!"	1
said	1
his	1
Mammy.	1
"O	1
Epaminondas,	1
Epaminondas,	1
you	1
ain't	1
got	1
the	1
sense	1
you	1
was	1
born	1
with;	1
you	1
never	1
did	1
have	1
the	1
sense	1
you	1
was	1
born	1
with;	1
you	1
never	1
will	1
have	1
the	1
sense	1
you	1
was	1
born	1
with!	1
Now	1
I	1
ain't	1
gwine	1
tell	1
you	1
any	1
more	1
ways	1
to	1
bring	1
truck	1
home.	1
And	1
don't	1
you	1
go	1
see	1
your	1
Auntie,	1
neither.	1
I'll	1
go	1
see	1
her	1
my	1
own	1
self.	1
But	1
I'll	1
just	1
tell	1
you	1
one	1
thing,	1
Epaminondas!	1
You	1
see	1
these	1
here	1
six	1
mince	1
pies	1
I	1
done	1
make?	1
You	1
see	1
how	1
I	1
done	1
set	1
'em	1
on	1
the	1
doorstep	1
to	1
cool?	1
Well,	1
now,	1
you	1
hear	1
me,	1
Epaminondas,	1
_you	1
be	1
careful	1
how	1
you	1
step	1
on	1
those	1
pies_!"	1
"Yes,	1
Mammy,"	1
said	1
Epaminondas.	1
Then	1
Epaminondas'	1
Mammy	1
put	1
on	1
her	1
bonnet	1
and	1
her	1
shawl	1
and	1
took	1
a	1
basket	1
in	1
her	1
hand	1
and	1
went	1
away	1
to	1
see	1
Auntie.	1
The	1
six	1
mince	1
pies	1
sat	1
cooling	1
in	1
a	1
row	1
on	1
the	1
doorstep.	1
And	1
then,--and	1
then,--Epaminondas	1
_was_	1
careful	1
how	1
he	1
stepped	1
on	1
those	1
pies!	1
He	1
stepped	1
(imitate)--right--in--the--middle--of--every--one.	1
*	1
*	1
*	1
*	1
*	1
And,	1
do	1
you	1
know,	1
children,	1
nobody	1
knows	1
what	1
happened	1
next!	1
The	1
person	1
who	1
told	1
me	1
the	1
story	1
didn't	1
know;	1
nobody	1
knows.	1
But	1
you	1
can	1
guess.	1
THE	1
BOY	1
WHO	1
CRIED	1
"WOLF!"	1
There	1
was	1
once	1
a	1
shepherd-boy	1
who	1
kept	1
his	1
flock	1
at	1
a	1
little	1
distance	1
from	1
the	1
village.	1
Once	1
he	1
thought	1
he	1
would	1
play	1
a	1
trick	1
on	1
the	1
villagers	1
and	1
have	1
some	1
fun	1
at	1
their	1
expense.	1
So	1
he	1
ran	1
toward	1
the	1
village	1
crying	1
out,	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
might,--	1
"Wolf!	1
Wolf!	1
Come	1
and	1
help!	1
The	1
wolves	1
are	1
at	1
my	1
lambs!"	1
The	1
kind	1
villagers	1
left	1
their	1
work	1
and	1
ran	1
to	1
the	1
field	1
to	1
help	1
him.	1
But	1
when	1
they	1
got	1
there	1
the	1
boy	1
laughed	1
at	1
them	1
for	1
their	1
pains;	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
wolf	1
there.	1
Still	1
another	1
day	1
the	1
boy	1
tried	1
the	1
same	1
trick,	1
and	1
the	1
villagers	1
came	1
running	1
to	1
help	1
and	1
got	1
laughed	1
at	1
again.	1
Then	1
one	1
day	1
a	1
wolf	1
did	1
break	1
into	1
the	1
fold	1
and	1
began	1
killing	1
the	1
lambs.	1
In	1
great	1
fright,	1
the	1
boy	1
ran	1
for	1
help.	1
"Wolf!	1
Wolf!"	1
he	1
screamed.	1
"There	1
is	1
a	1
wolf	1
in	1
the	1
flock!	1
Help!"	1
The	1
villagers	1
heard	1
him,	1
but	1
they	1
thought	1
it	1
was	1
another	1
mean	1
trick;	1
no	1
one	1
paid	1
the	1
least	1
attention,	1
or	1
went	1
near	1
him.	1
And	1
the	1
shepherd-boy	1
lost	1
all	1
his	1
sheep.	1
That	1
is	1
the	1
kind	1
of	1
thing	1
that	1
happens	1
to	1
people	1
who	1
lie:	1
even	1
when	1
they	1
tell	1
the	1
truth	1
no	1
one	1
believes	1
them.	1
THE	1
FROG	1
KING	1
Did	1
you	1
ever	1
hear	1
the	1
old	1
story	1
about	1
the	1
foolish	1
Frogs?	1
The	1
Frogs	1
in	1
a	1
certain	1
swamp	1
decided	1
that	1
they	1
needed	1
a	1
king;	1
they	1
had	1
always	1
got	1
along	1
perfectly	1
well	1
without	1
one,	1
but	1
they	1
suddenly	1
made	1
up	1
their	1
minds	1
that	1
a	1
king	1
they	1
must	1
have.	1
They	1
sent	1
a	1
messenger	1
to	1
Jove	1
and	1
begged	1
him	1
to	1
send	1
a	1
king	1
to	1
rule	1
over	1
them.	1
Jove	1
saw	1
how	1
stupid	1
they	1
were,	1
and	1
sent	1
a	1
king	1
who	1
could	1
not	1
harm	1
them:	1
he	1
tossed	1
a	1
big	1
log	1
into	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
pond.	1
At	1
the	1
splash	1
the	1
Frogs	1
were	1
terribly	1
frightened,	1
and	1
dived	1
into	1
their	1
holes	1
to	1
hide	1
from	1
King	1
Log.	1
But	1
after	1
a	1
while,	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
king	1
never	1
moved,	1
they	1
got	1
over	1
their	1
fright	1
and	1
went	1
and	1
sat	1
on	1
him.	1
And	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
found	1
he	1
really	1
could	1
not	1
hurt	1
them	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
despise	1
him;	1
and	1
finally	1
they	1
sent	1
another	1
messenger	1
to	1
Jove	1
to	1
ask	1
for	1
a	1
new	1
king.	1
Jove	1
sent	1
an	1
eel.	1
The	1
Frogs	1
were	1
much	1
pleased	1
and	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
frightened	1
when	1
King	1
Eel	1
came	1
wriggling	1
and	1
swimming	1
among	1
them.	1
But	1
as	1
the	1
days	1
went	1
on,	1
and	1
the	1
eel	1
was	1
perfectly	1
harmless,	1
they	1
stopped	1
being	1
afraid;	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
stopped	1
fearing	1
King	1
Eel	1
they	1
stopped	1
respecting	1
him.	1
Soon	1
they	1
sent	1
a	1
third	1
messenger	1
to	1
Jove,	1
and	1
begged	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
have	1
a	1
better	1
king,--a	1
king	1
who	1
was	1
worth	1
while.	1
It	1
was	1
too	1
much;	1
Jove	1
was	1
angry	1
at	1
their	1
stupidity	1
at	1
last.	1
"I	1
will	1
give	1
you	1
a	1
king	1
such	1
as	1
you	1
deserve!"	1
he	1
said;	1
and	1
he	1
sent	1
them	1
a	1
Stork.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
Frogs	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
surface	1
to	1
greet	1
the	1
new	1
king,	1
King	1
Stork	1
caught	1
them	1
in	1
his	1
long	1
bill	1
and	1
gobbled	1
them	1
up.	1
One	1
after	1
another	1
they	1
came	1
bobbing	1
up,	1
and	1
one	1
after	1
another	1
the	1
stork	1
ate	1
them.	1
He	1
was	1
indeed	1
a	1
king	1
worthy	1
of	1
them!	1
THE	1
SUN	1
AND	1
THE	1
WIND	1
The	1
Sun	1
and	1
the	1
Wind	1
once	1
had	1
a	1
quarrel	1
as	1
to	1
which	1
was	1
the	1
stronger.	1
Each	1
believed	1
himself	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
more	1
powerful.	1
While	1
they	1
were	1
arguing	1
they	1
saw	1
a	1
traveller	1
walking	1
along	1
the	1
country	1
highway,	1
wearing	1
a	1
great	1
cloak.	1
"Here	1
is	1
a	1
chance	1
to	1
test	1
our	1
strength,"	1
said	1
the	1
Wind;	1
"let	1
us	1
see	1
which	1
of	1
us	1
is	1
strong	1
enough	1
to	1
make	1
that	1
traveller	1
take	1
off	1
his	1
cloak;	1
the	1
one	1
who	1
can	1
do	1
that	1
shall	1
be	1
acknowledged	1
the	1
more	1
powerful."	1
"Agreed,"	1
said	1
the	1
Sun.	1
Instantly	1
the	1
Wind	1
began	1
to	1
blow;	1
he	1
puffed	1
and	1
tugged	1
at	1
the	1
man's	1
cloak,	1
and	1
raised	1
a	1
storm	1
of	1
hail	1
and	1
rain,	1
to	1
beat	1
at	1
it.	1
But	1
the	1
colder	1
it	1
grew	1
and	1
the	1
more	1
it	1
stormed,	1
the	1
tighter	1
the	1
traveller	1
held	1
his	1
cloak	1
around	1
him.	1
The	1
Wind	1
could	1
not	1
get	1
it	1
off.	1
Now	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
Sun's	1
turn.	1
He	1
shone	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
beams	1
on	1
the	1
man's	1
shoulders.	1
As	1
it	1
grew	1
hotter	1
and	1
hotter,	1
the	1
man	1
unfastened	1
his	1
cloak;	1
then	1
he	1
threw	1
it	1
back;	1
at	1
last	1
he	1
took	1
it	1
off!	1
The	1
Sun	1
had	1
won.	1
THE	1
LITTLE	1
JACKAL	1
AND	1
THE	1
ALLIGATOR	1
The	1
little	1
Jackal	1
was	1
very	1
fond	1
of	1
shell-fish.	1
He	1
used	1
to	1
go	1
down	1
by	1
the	1
river	1
and	1
hunt	1
along	1
the	1
edges	1
for	1
crabs	1
and	1
such	1
things.	1
And	1
once,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
hunting	1
for	1
crabs,	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
hungry	1
that	1
he	1
put	1
his	1
paw	1
into	1
the	1
water	1
after	1
a	1
crab	1
without	1
looking	1
first,--which	1
you	1
never	1
should	1
do!	1
The	1
minute	1
he	1
put	1
in	1
his	1
paw,	1
_snap_!--the	1
big	1
Alligator	1
who	1
lives	1
in	1
the	1
mud	1
down	1
there	1
had	1
it	1
in	1
his	1
jaws.	1
"Oh,	1
dear!"	1
thought	1
the	1
little	1
Jackal;	1
"the	1
big	1
Alligator	1
has	1
my	1
paw	1
in	1
his	1
mouth!	1
In	1
another	1
minute	1
he	1
will	1
pull	1
me	1
down	1
and	1
gobble	1
me	1
up!	1
What	1
shall	1
I	1
do?	1
what	1
shall	1
I	1
do?"	1
Then	1
he	1
thought,	1
suddenly,	1
"I'll	1
deceive	1
him!"	1
So	1
he	1
put	1
on	1
a	1
very	1
cheerful	1
voice,	1
as	1
if	1
nothing	1
at	1
all	1
were	1
the	1
matter,	1
and	1
he	1
said,--	1
"Ho!	1
ho!	1
Clever	1
Mr	1
Alligator!	1
Smart	1
Mr	1
Alligator,	1
to	1
take	1
that	1
old	1
bulrush	1
root	1
for	1
my	1
paw!	1
I	1
hope	1
you'll	1
find	1
it	1
very	1
tender!"	1
The	1
old	1
Alligator	1
was	1
hidden	1
away	1
beneath	1
the	1
mud	1
and	1
bulrush	1
leaves,	1
and	1
he	1
couldn't	1
see	1
anything.	1
He	1
thought,	1
"Pshaw!	1
I've	1
made	1
a	1
mistake."	1
So	1
he	1
opened	1
his	1
mouth	1
and	1
let	1
the	1
little	1
Jackal	1
go.	1
The	1
little	1
Jackal	1
ran	1
away	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
he	1
could,	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
ran	1
he	1
called	1
out,--	1
"Thank	1
you,	1
Mr	1
Alligator!	1
Kind	1
Mr	1
Alligator!	1
_So_	1
kind	1
of	1
you	1
to	1
let	1
me	1
go!"	1
The	1
old	1
Alligator	1
lashed	1
with	1
his	1
tail	1
and	1
snapped	1
with	1
his	1
jaws,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
too	1
late;	1
the	1
little	1
Jackal	1
was	1
out	1
of	1
reach.	1
After	1
this	1
the	1
little	1
Jackal	1
kept	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
river,	1
out	1
of	1
danger.	1
But	1
after	1
about	1
a	1
week	1
he	1
got	1
such	1
an	1
appetite	1
for	1
crabs	1
that	1
nothing	1
else	1
would	1
do	1
at	1
all;	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
a	1
crab.	1
So	1
he	1
went	1
down	1
by	1
the	1
river	1
and	1
looked	1
all	1
around,	1
very	1
carefully.	1
He	1
didn't	1
see	1
the	1
old	1
Alligator,	1
but	1
he	1
thought	1
to	1
himself,	1
"I	1
think	1
I'll	1
not	1
take	1
any	1
chances."	1
So	1
he	1
stood	1
still	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
talk	1
out	1
loud	1
to	1
himself.	1
He	1
said,--	1
"When	1
I	1
don't	1
see	1
any	1
little	1
crabs	1
on	1
the	1
land	1
I	1
generally	1
see	1
them	1
sticking	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
water,	1
and	1
then	1
I	1
put	1
my	1
paw	1
in	1
and	1
catch	1
them.	1
I	1
wonder	1
if	1
there	1
are	1
any	1
fat	1
little	1
crabs	1
in	1
the	1
water	1
to-day?"	1
The	1
old	1
Alligator	1
was	1
hidden	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
mud	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
river,	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
what	1
the	1
little	1
Jackal	1
said,	1
he	1
thought,	1
"Aha!	1
I'll	1
pretend	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
little	1
crab,	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
puts	1
his	1
paw	1
in,	1
I'll	1
make	1
my	1
dinner	1
of	1
him."	1
So	1
he	1
stuck	1
the	1
black	1
end	1
of	1
his	1
snout	1
above	1
the	1
water	1
and	1
waited.	1
The	1
little	1
Jackal	1
took	1
one	1
look,	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
said,--	1
"Thank	1
you,	1
Mr	1
Alligator!	1
Kind	1
Mr	1
Alligator!	1
You	1
are	1
_exceedingly_	1
kind	1
to	1
show	1
me	1
where	1
you	1
are!	1
I	1
will	1
have	1
dinner	1
elsewhere."	1
And	1
he	1
ran	1
away	1
like	1
the	1
wind.	1
The	1
old	1
Alligator	1
foamed	1
at	1
the	1
mouth,	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
angry,	1
but	1
the	1
little	1
Jackal	1
was	1
gone.	1
For	1
two	1
whole	1
weeks	1
the	1
little	1
Jackal	1
kept	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
river.	1
Then,	1
one	1
day	1
he	1
got	1
a	1
feeling	1
inside	1
him	1
that	1
nothing	1
but	1
crabs	1
could	1
satisfy:	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
at	1
least	1
one	1
crab.	1
Very	1
cautiously,	1
he	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
river	1
and	1
looked	1
all	1
around.	1
He	1
saw	1
no	1
sign	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
Alligator.	1
Still,	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
mean	1
to	1
take	1
any	1
chances.	1
So	1
he	1
stood	1
quite	1
still	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
himself,--it	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
way	1
he	1
had.	1
He	1
said,--	1
"When	1
I	1
don't	1
see	1
any	1
little	1
crabs	1
on	1
the	1
shore,	1
or	1
sticking	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
water,	1
I	1
usually	1
see	1
them	1
blowing	1
bubbles	1
from	1
under	1
the	1
water;	1
the	1
little	1
bubbles	1
go	1
_puff,	1
puff,	1
puff_,	1
and	1
then	1
they	1
go	1
_pop,	1
pop,	1
pop_,	1
and	1
they	1
show	1
me	1
where	1
the	1
little	1
juicy	1
crabs	1
are,	1
so	1
I	1
can	1
put	1
my	1
paw	1
in	1
and	1
catch	1
them.	1
I	1
wonder	1
if	1
I	1
shall	1
see	1
any	1
little	1
bubbles	1
to-day?"	1
The	1
old	1
Alligator,	1
lying	1
low	1
in	1
the	1
mud	1
and	1
weeds,	1
heard	1
this,	1
and	1
he	1
thought,	1
"Pooh!	1
_That's_	1
easy	1
enough;	1
I'll	1
just	1
blow	1
some	1
little	1
crab-bubbles,	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
will	1
put	1
his	1
paw	1
in	1
where	1
I	1
can	1
get	1
it."	1
So	1
he	1
blew,	1
and	1
he	1
blew,	1
a	1
mighty	1
blast,	1
and	1
the	1
bubbles	1
rose	1
in	1
a	1
perfect	1
whirlpool,	1
fizzing	1
and	1
swirling.	1
The	1
little	1
Jackal	1
didn't	1
have	1
to	1
be	1
told	1
who	1
was	1
underneath	1
those	1
bubbles:	1
he	1
took	1
one	1
quick	1
look,	1
and	1
off	1
he	1
ran.	1
But	1
as	1
he	1
went,	1
he	1
sang,--	1
"Thank	1
you,	1
Mr	1
Alligator!	1
Kind	1
Mr	1
Alligator!	1
You	1
are	1
the	1
kindest	1
Alligator	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
to	1
show	1
me	1
where	1
you	1
are,	1
so	1
nicely!	1
I'll	1
breakfast	1
at	1
another	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
river."	1
The	1
old	1
Alligator	1
was	1
so	1
furious	1
that	1
he	1
crawled	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
bank	1
and	1
went	1
after	1
the	1
little	1
Jackal;	1
but,	1
dear,	1
dear,	1
he	1
couldn't	1
catch	1
the	1
little	1
Jackal;	1
he	1
ran	1
far	1
too	1
fast.	1
After	1
this,	1
the	1
little	1
Jackal	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
to	1
risk	1
going	1
near	1
the	1
water,	1
so	1
he	1
ate	1
no	1
more	1
crabs.	1
But	1
he	1
found	1
a	1
garden	1
of	1
wild	1
figs,	1
which	1
were	1
so	1
good	1
that	1
he	1
went	1
there	1
every	1
day,	1
and	1
ate	1
them	1
instead	1
of	1
shell-fish.	1
Now	1
the	1
old	1
Alligator	1
found	1
this	1
out,	1
and	1
he	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
little	1
Jackal	1
for	1
supper,	1
or	1
to	1
die	1
trying.	1
So	1
he	1
crept,	1
and	1
crawled,	1
and	1
dragged	1
himself	1
over	1
the	1
ground	1
to	1
the	1
garden	1
of	1
wild	1
figs.	1
There	1
he	1
made	1
a	1
huge	1
pile	1
of	1
figs	1
under	1
the	1
biggest	1
of	1
the	1
wild	1
fig	1
trees,	1
and	1
hid	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
pile.	1
After	1
a	1
while	1
the	1
little	1
Jackal	1
came	1
dancing	1
into	1
the	1
garden,	1
very	1
happy	1
and	1
free	1
from	1
care,--_but_	1
looking	1
all	1
around.	1
He	1
saw	1
the	1
huge	1
pile	1
of	1
figs	1
under	1
the	1
big	1
fig	1
tree.	1
"H-m,"	1
he	1
thought,	1
"that	1
looks	1
singularly	1
like	1
my	1
friend,	1
the	1
Alligator.	1
I'll	1
investigate	1
a	1
bit."	1
He	1
stood	1
quite	1
still	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
himself,--it	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
way	1
he	1
had.	1
He	1
said,--	1
"The	1
little	1
figs	1
I	1
like	1
best	1
are	1
the	1
fat,	1
ripe,	1
juicy	1
ones	1
that	1
drop	1
off	1
when	1
the	1
breeze	1
blows;	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
wind	1
blows	1
them	1
about	1
on	1
the	1
ground,	1
this	1
way	1
and	1
that;	1
the	1
great	1
heap	1
of	1
figs	1
over	1
there	1
is	1
so	1
still	1
that	1
I	1
think	1
they	1
must	1
be	1
all	1
bad	1
figs."	1
The	1
old	1
Alligator,	1
underneath	1
his	1
fig	1
pile,	1
thought,--	1
"Bother	1
the	1
suspicious	1
little	1
Jackal!	1
I	1
shall	1
have	1
to	1
make	1
these	1
figs	1
roll	1
about,	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
think	1
the	1
wind	1
moves	1
them."	1
And	1
straight-way	1
he	1
humped	1
himself	1
up	1
and	1
moved,	1
and	1
sent	1
the	1
little	1
figs	1
flying,--and	1
his	1
back	1
showed	1
through.	1
The	1
little	1
Jackal	1
did	1
not	1
wait	1
for	1
a	1
second	1
look.	1
He	1
ran	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
garden	1
like	1
the	1
wind.	1
But	1
as	1
he	1
ran	1
he	1
called	1
back,--	1
"Thank	1
you,	1
again,	1
Mr	1
Alligator;	1
very	1
sweet	1
of	1
you	1
to	1
show	1
me	1
where	1
you	1
are;	1
I	1
can't	1
stay	1
to	1
thank	1
you	1
as	1
I	1
should	1
like:	1
good-bye!"	1
At	1
this	1
the	1
old	1
Alligator	1
was	1
beside	1
himself	1
with	1
rage.	1
He	1
vowed	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
the	1
little	1
Jackal	1
for	1
supper	1
this	1
time,	1
come	1
what	1
might.	1
So	1
he	1
crept	1
and	1
crawled	1
over	1
the	1
ground	1
till	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
little	1
Jackal's	1
house.	1
Then	1
he	1
crept	1
and	1
crawled	1
inside,	1
and	1
hid	1
himself	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
house,	1
to	1
wait	1
till	1
the	1
little	1
Jackal	1
should	1
come	1
home.	1
By	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
little	1
Jackal	1
came	1
dancing	1
home,	1
happy	1
and	1
free	1
from	1
care,--_but_	1
looking	1
all	1
around.	1
Presently,	1
as	1
he	1
came	1
along,	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
ground	1
was	1
all	1
raked	1
up	1
as	1
if	1
something	1
very	1
heavy	1
had	1
been	1
dragged	1
over	1
it.	1
The	1
little	1
Jackal	1
stopped	1
and	1
looked.	1
"What's	1
this?	1
what's	1
this?"	1
he	1
said.	1
Then	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
his	1
house	1
was	1
crushed	1
at	1
the	1
sides	1
and	1
broken,	1
as	1
if	1
something	1
very	1
big	1
had	1
gone	1
through	1
it.	1
"What's	1
this?	1
What's	1
this?"	1
the	1
little	1
Jackal	1
said.	1
"I	1
think	1
I'll	1
investigate	1
a	1
little!"	1
So	1
he	1
stood	1
quite	1
still	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
himself	1
(you	1
remember,	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
way	1
he	1
had),	1
but	1
loudly.	1
He	1
said,--	1
"How	1
strange	1
that	1
my	1
little	1
House	1
doesn't	1
speak	1
to	1
me!	1
Why	1
don't	1
you	1
speak	1
to	1
me,	1
little	1
House?	1
You	1
always	1
speak	1
to	1
me,	1
if	1
everything	1
is	1
all	1
right,	1
when	1
I	1
come	1
home.	1
I	1
wonder	1
if	1
anything	1
is	1
wrong	1
with	1
my	1
little	1
House?"	1
The	1
old	1
Alligator	1
thought	1
to	1
himself	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
certainly	1
pretend	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
little	1
House,	1
or	1
the	1
little	1
Jackal	1
would	1
never	1
come	1
in.	1
So	1
he	1
put	1
on	1
as	1
pleasant	1
a	1
voice	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
(which	1
is	1
not	1
saying	1
much)	1
and	1
said,--	1
"Hullo,	1
little	1
Jackal!"	1
Oh!	1
When	1
the	1
little	1
Jackal	1
heard	1
that,	1
he	1
was	1
frightened	1
enough,	1
for	1
once.	1
"It's	1
the	1
old	1
Alligator,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"and	1
if	1
I	1
don't	1
make	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
him	1
this	1
time	1
he	1
will	1
certainly	1
make	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
me.	1
What	1
shall	1
I	1
do?"	1
He	1
thought	1
very	1
fast.	1
Then	1
he	1
spoke	1
out	1
pleasantly.	1
"Thank	1
you,	1
little	1
House,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"it's	1
good	1
to	1
hear	1
your	1
pretty	1
voice,	1
dear	1
little	1
House,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
in	1
with	1
you	1
in	1
a	1
minute;	1
only	1
first	1
I	1
must	1
gather	1
some	1
firewood	1
for	1
dinner."	1
Then	1
he	1
went	1
and	1
gathered	1
firewood,	1
and	1
more	1
firewood,	1
and	1
more	1
firewood;	1
and	1
he	1
piled	1
it	1
all	1
up	1
solid	1
against	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
round	1
the	1
house;	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
set	1
fire	1
to	1
it!	1
And	1
it	1
smoked	1
and	1
burned	1
till	1
it	1
smoked	1
that	1
old	1
Alligator	1
to	1
smoked	1
herring!	1
THE	1
LARKS	1
IN	1
THE	1
CORNFIELD	1
There	1
was	1
once	1
a	1
family	1
of	1
little	1
Larks	1
who	1
lived	1
with	1
their	1
mother	1
in	1
a	1
nest	1
in	1
a	1
cornfield.	1
When	1
the	1
corn	1
was	1
ripe	1
the	1
mother	1
Lark	1
watched	1
very	1
carefully	1
to	1
see	1
if	1
there	1
were	1
any	1
sign	1
of	1
the	1
reapers'	1
coming,	1
for	1
she	1
knew	1
that	1
when	1
they	1
came	1
their	1
sharp	1
knives	1
would	1
cut	1
down	1
the	1
nest	1
and	1
hurt	1
the	1
baby	1
Larks.	1
So	1
every	1
day,	1
when	1
she	1
went	1
out	1
for	1
food,	1
she	1
told	1
the	1
little	1
Larks	1
to	1
look	1
and	1
listen	1
very	1
closely	1
to	1
everything	1
that	1
went	1
on,	1
and	1
to	1
tell	1
her	1
all	1
they	1
saw	1
and	1
heard	1
when	1
she	1
came	1
home.	1
One	1
day	1
when	1
she	1
came	1
home	1
the	1
little	1
Larks	1
were	1
much	1
frightened.	1
"Oh,	1
Mother,	1
dear	1
Mother,"	1
they	1
said,	1
"you	1
must	1
move	1
us	1
away	1
to-night!	1
The	1
farmer	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
field	1
to-day,	1
and	1
he	1
said,	1
'The	1
corn	1
is	1
ready	1
to	1
cut;	1
we	1
must	1
call	1
in	1
the	1
neighbours	1
to	1
help.'	1
And	1
then	1
he	1
told	1
his	1
son	1
to	1
go	1
out	1
to-night	1
and	1
ask	1
all	1
the	1
neighbours	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
reap	1
the	1
corn	1
to-morrow."	1
The	1
mother	1
Lark	1
laughed.	1
"Don't	1
be	1
frightened,"	1
she	1
said;	1
"if	1
he	1
waits	1
for	1
his	1
neighbours	1
to	1
reap	1
the	1
corn	1
we	1
shall	1
have	1
plenty	1
of	1
time	1
to	1
move;	1
tell	1
me	1
what	1
he	1
says	1
to-morrow."	1
The	1
next	1
night	1
the	1
little	1
Larks	1
were	1
quite	1
trembling	1
with	1
fear;	1
the	1
moment	1
their	1
mother	1
got	1
home	1
they	1
cried	1
out,	1
"Mother,	1
you	1
must	1
surely	1
move	1
us	1
to-night!	1
The	1
farmer	1
came	1
to-day	1
and	1
said,	1
'The	1
corn	1
is	1
getting	1
too	1
ripe;	1
we	1
cannot	1
wait	1
for	1
our	1
neighbours;	1
we	1
must	1
ask	1
our	1
relatives	1
to	1
help	1
us.'	1
And	1
then	1
he	1
called	1
his	1
son	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
to	1
ask	1
all	1
the	1
uncles	1
and	1
cousins	1
to	1
come	1
to-morrow	1
and	1
cut	1
the	1
corn.	1
Shall	1
we	1
not	1
move	1
to-night?"	1
"Don't	1
worry,"	1
said	1
the	1
mother	1
Lark;	1
"the	1
uncles	1
and	1
cousins	1
have	1
plenty	1
of	1
reaping	1
to	1
do	1
for	1
themselves;	1
we'll	1
not	1
move	1
yet."	1
The	1
third	1
night,	1
when	1
the	1
mother	1
Lark	1
came	1
home,	1
the	1
baby	1
Larks	1
said,	1
"Mother,	1
dear,	1
the	1
farmer	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
field	1
to-day,	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
corn	1
he	1
was	1
quite	1
angry;	1
he	1
said,	1
'This	1
will	1
never	1
do!	1
The	1
corn	1
is	1
getting	1
too	1
ripe;	1
it's	1
no	1
use	1
to	1
wait	1
for	1
our	1
relatives,	1
we	1
shall	1
have	1
to	1
cut	1
this	1
corn	1
ourselves.'	1
And	1
then	1
he	1
called	1
his	1
son	1
and	1
said,	1
'Go	1
out	1
to-night	1
and	1
hire	1
reapers,	1
and	1
to-morrow	1
we	1
will	1
begin	1
to	1
cut.'"	1
"Well,"	1
said	1
the	1
mother,	1
"that	1
is	1
another	1
story;	1
when	1
a	1
man	1
begins	1
to	1
do	1
his	1
own	1
business,	1
instead	1
of	1
asking	1
somebody	1
else	1
to	1
do	1
it,	1
things	1
get	1
done.	1
I	1
will	1
move	1
you	1
out	1
to-night."	1
A	1
TRUE	1
STORY	1
ABOUT	1
A	1
GIRL	1
Once	1
there	1
were	1
four	1
little	1
girls	1
who	1
lived	1
in	1
a	1
big,	1
bare	1
house,	1
in	1
the	1
country.	1
They	1
were	1
very	1
poor,	1
but	1
they	1
had	1
the	1
happiest	1
times	1
you	1
ever	1
heard	1
of,	1
because	1
they	1
were	1
very	1
rich	1
in	1
everything	1
except	1
money.	1
They	1
had	1
a	1
wonderful,	1
wise	1
father,	1
who	1
knew	1
stories	1
to	1
tell,	1
and	1
who	1
taught	1
them	1
their	1
lessons	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
beautiful	1
way	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
better	1
than	1
play;	1
they	1
had	1
a	1
lovely,	1
merry,	1
kind	1
mother,	1
who	1
was	1
never	1
too	1
tired	1
to	1
help	1
them	1
work	1
or	1
watch	1
them	1
play;	1
and	1
they	1
had	1
all	1
the	1
great	1
green	1
country	1
to	1
play	1
in.	1
There	1
were	1
dark,	1
shadowy	1
woods,	1
and	1
fields	1
of	1
flowers,	1
and	1
a	1
river.	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
big	1
barn.	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
girls	1
was	1
named	1
Louisa.	1
She	1
was	1
very	1
pretty,	1
and	1
ever	1
so	1
strong;	1
she	1
could	1
run	1
for	1
miles	1
through	1
the	1
woods	1
and	1
not	1
get	1
tired.	1
She	1
had	1
a	1
splendid	1
brain	1
in	1
her	1
little	1
head;	1
it	1
liked	1
study,	1
and	1
it	1
thought	1
interesting	1
thoughts	1
all	1
day	1
long.	1
Louisa	1
liked	1
to	1
sit	1
in	1
a	1
corner	1
by	1
herself,	1
sometimes,	1
and	1
write	1
thoughts	1
in	1
her	1
diary;	1
all	1
the	1
little	1
girls	1
kept	1
diaries.	1
She	1
liked	1
to	1
make	1
up	1
stories	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
head,	1
and	1
sometimes	1
she	1
made	1
verses.	1
When	1
the	1
four	1
little	1
sisters	1
had	1
finished	1
their	1
lessons,	1
and	1
had	1
helped	1
their	1
mother	1
wash	1
up	1
and	1
sew,	1
they	1
used	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
big	1
barn	1
to	1
play;	1
and	1
the	1
best	1
play	1
of	1
all	1
was	1
theatricals.	1
Louisa	1
liked	1
theatricals	1
better	1
than	1
anything.	1
They	1
made	1
the	1
barn	1
into	1
a	1
theatre,	1
and	1
the	1
grown-up	1
people	1
came	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
plays	1
they	1
acted.	1
They	1
used	1
to	1
climb	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
hay-loft	1
for	1
a	1
stage,	1
and	1
the	1
grown	1
people	1
sat	1
in	1
chairs	1
on	1
the	1
floor.	1
It	1
was	1
great	1
fun.	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
plays	1
they	1
acted	1
was	1
_Jack	1
and	1
the	1
Beanstalk_.	1
They	1
had	1
a	1
ladder	1
from	1
the	1
floor	1
to	1
the	1
loft,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
ladder	1
they	1
tied	1
a	1
vine	1
all	1
the	1
way	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
loft,	1
to	1
look	1
like	1
the	1
wonderful	1
beanstalk.	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
girls	1
was	1
dressed	1
up	1
to	1
look	1
like	1
Jack,	1
and	1
she	1
acted	1
that	1
part.	1
When	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
in	1
the	1
story	1
where	1
the	1
giant	1
tried	1
to	1
follow	1
Jack,	1
the	1
little	1
girl	1
cut	1
down	1
the	1
beanstalk,	1
and	1
down	1
came	1
the	1
giant	1
tumbling	1
from	1
the	1
loft.	1
The	1
giant	1
was	1
made	1
out	1
of	1
pillows,	1
with	1
a	1
great,	1
fierce	1
head	1
of	1
paper,	1
and	1
funny	1
clothes.	1
Another	1
story	1
that	1
they	1
acted	1
was	1
_Cinderella_.	1
They	1
made	1
a	1
wonderful	1
big	1
pumpkin	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
wheelbarrow,	1
trimmed	1
with	1
yellow	1
paper,	1
and	1
Cinderella	1
rolled	1
away	1
in	1
it,	1
when	1
the	1
fairy	1
godmother	1
waved	1
her	1
wand.	1
One	1
other	1
beautiful	1
story	1
they	1
used	1
to	1
play.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
_Pilgrim's	1
Progress_;	1
if	1
you	1
have	1
never	1
heard	1
it,	1
you	1
must	1
be	1
sure	1
to	1
read	1
it	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
you	1
can	1
read	1
well	1
enough	1
to	1
understand	1
the	1
old-fashioned	1
words.	1
The	1
little	1
girls	1
used	1
to	1
put	1
shells	1
in	1
their	1
hats	1
for	1
a	1
sign	1
they	1
were	1
on	1
a	1
pilgrimage,	1
as	1
the	1
old	1
pilgrims	1
used	1
to	1
do;	1
then	1
they	1
made	1
journeys	1
over	1
the	1
hill	1
behind	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
through	1
the	1
woods,	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
lanes;	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
pilgrimage	1
was	1
over	1
they	1
had	1
apples	1
and	1
nuts	1
to	1
eat,	1
in	1
the	1
happy	1
land	1
of	1
home.	1
Louisa	1
loved	1
all	1
these	1
plays,	1
and	1
she	1
made	1
some	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
and	1
wrote	1
them	1
down	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
children	1
could	1
act	1
them.	1
But	1
better	1
than	1
fun	1
or	1
writing	1
Louisa	1
loved	1
her	1
mother,	1
and	1
by	1
and	1
by,	1
as	1
the	1
little	1
girl	1
began	1
to	1
grow	1
into	1
a	1
big	1
girl,	1
she	1
felt	1
very	1
sad	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
dear	1
mother	1
work	1
so	1
hard.	1
She	1
helped	1
all	1
she	1
could	1
with	1
the	1
housework,	1
but	1
nothing	1
could	1
really	1
help	1
the	1
tired	1
mother	1
except	1
money;	1
she	1
needed	1
money	1
for	1
food	1
and	1
clothes,	1
and	1
someone	1
grown	1
up,	1
to	1
help	1
in	1
the	1
house.	1
But	1
there	1
never	1
was	1
enough	1
money	1
for	1
these	1
things,	1
and	1
Louisa's	1
mother	1
grew	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
weary,	1
and	1
sometimes	1
ill.	1
I	1
cannot	1
tell	1
you	1
how	1
much	1
Louisa	1
suffered	1
over	1
this.	1
At	1
last,	1
as	1
Louisa	1
thought	1
about	1
it,	1
she	1
came	1
to	1
care	1
more	1
about	1
helping	1
her	1
mother	1
and	1
her	1
father	1
and	1
her	1
sisters	1
than	1
about	1
anything	1
else	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
world.	1
And	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
work	1
very	1
hard	1
to	1
earn	1
money.	1
She	1
sewed	1
for	1
people,	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
older	1
she	1
taught	1
some	1
little	1
girls	1
their	1
lessons,	1
and	1
then	1
she	1
wrote	1
stories	1
for	1
the	1
papers.	1
Every	1
bit	1
of	1
money	1
she	1
earned,	1
except	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
to	1
use,	1
she	1
gave	1
to	1
her	1
dear	1
family.	1
It	1
helped	1
very	1
much,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
little	1
that	1
Louisa	1
never	1
felt	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
were	1
doing	1
anything.	1
Every	1
year	1
she	1
grew	1
more	1
unselfish,	1
and	1
every	1
year	1
she	1
worked	1
harder.	1
She	1
liked	1
writing	1
stories	1
best	1
of	1
all	1
her	1
work,	1
but	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
get	1
much	1
money	1
for	1
them,	1
and	1
some	1
people	1
told	1
her	1
she	1
was	1
wasting	1
her	1
time.	1
At	1
last,	1
one	1
day,	1
a	1
publisher	1
asked	1
Louisa,	1
who	1
was	1
now	1
a	1
woman,	1
to	1
write	1
a	1
book	1
for	1
girls.	1
Louisa	1
was	1
not	1
very	1
well,	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
very	1
tired,	1
but	1
she	1
always	1
said,	1
"I'll	1
try,"	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
a	1
chance	1
to	1
work;	1
so	1
she	1
said,	1
"I'll	1
try,"	1
to	1
the	1
publisher.	1
When	1
she	1
thought	1
about	1
the	1
book	1
she	1
remembered	1
the	1
good	1
times	1
she	1
used	1
to	1
have	1
with	1
her	1
sisters	1
in	1
the	1
big,	1
bare	1
house	1
in	1
the	1
country.	1
And	1
so	1
she	1
wrote	1
a	1
story	1
and	1
put	1
all	1
that	1
in	1
it;	1
she	1
put	1
her	1
dear	1
mother	1
and	1
her	1
wise	1
father	1
in	1
it,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
little	1
sisters,	1
and	1
besides	1
the	1
jolly	1
times	1
and	1
the	1
plays,	1
she	1
put	1
the	1
sad,	1
hard	1
times	1
in,--the	1
work	1
and	1
worry	1
and	1
going	1
without	1
things.	1
When	1
the	1
book	1
was	1
written,	1
she	1
called	1
it	1
_Little	1
Women_,	1
and	1
sent	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
publisher.	1
And,	1
children,	1
the	1
little	1
book	1
made	1
Louisa	1
famous.	1
It	1
was	1
so	1
sweet	1
and	1
funny	1
and	1
sad	1
and	1
real,--like	1
our	1
own	1
lives,--that	1
everybody	1
wanted	1
to	1
read	1
it.	1
Everybody	1
bought	1
it,	1
and	1
much	1
money	1
came	1
from	1
it.	1
After	1
so	1
many	1
years,	1
little	1
Louisa's	1
wish	1
came	1
true:	1
she	1
bought	1
a	1
nice	1
house	1
for	1
her	1
family;	1
she	1
sent	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
sisters	1
to	1
Europe,	1
to	1
study;	1
she	1
gave	1
her	1
father	1
books;	1
but	1
best	1
of	1
all,	1
she	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
see	1
to	1
it	1
that	1
the	1
beloved	1
mother,	1
so	1
tired	1
and	1
so	1
ill,	1
could	1
have	1
rest	1
and	1
happiness.	1
Never	1
again	1
did	1
the	1
dear	1
mother	1
have	1
to	1
do	1
any	1
hard	1
work,	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
pretty	1
things	1
about	1
her	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
her	1
life.	1
Louisa	1
Alcott,	1
for	1
that	1
was	1
Louisa's	1
name,	1
wrote	1
many	1
beautiful	1
books	1
after	1
this,	1
and	1
she	1
became	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
famous	1
women	1
of	1
America.	1
But	1
I	1
think	1
the	1
most	1
beautiful	1
thing	1
about	1
her	1
is	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
telling	1
you:	1
that	1
she	1
loved	1
her	1
mother	1
so	1
well	1
that	1
she	1
gave	1
her	1
whole	1
life	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
happy.	1
MY	1
KINGDOM	1
The	1
little	1
Louisa	1
I	1
told	1
you	1
about,	1
who	1
wrote	1
verses	1
and	1
stories	1
in	1
her	1
diary,	1
used	1
to	1
like	1
to	1
play	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
princess,	1
and	1
that	1
her	1
kingdom	1
was	1
her	1
own	1
mind.	1
When	1
she	1
had	1
unkind	1
or	1
dissatisfied	1
thoughts,	1
she	1
tried	1
to	1
get	1
rid	1
of	1
them	1
by	1
playing	1
they	1
were	1
enemies	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom;	1
and	1
she	1
drove	1
them	1
out	1
with	1
soldiers;	1
the	1
soldiers	1
were	1
patience,	1
duty,	1
and	1
love.	1
It	1
used	1
to	1
help	1
Louisa	1
to	1
be	1
good	1
to	1
play	1
this,	1
and	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
may	1
have	1
helped	1
make	1
her	1
the	1
splendid	1
woman	1
she	1
was	1
afterward.	1
Maybe	1
you	1
would	1
like	1
to	1
hear	1
a	1
poem	1
she	1
wrote	1
about	1
it,	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
only	1
fourteen	1
years	1
old.	1
It	1
will	1
help	1
you,	1
too,	1
to	1
think	1
the	1
same	1
thoughts.	1
A	1
little	1
kingdom	1
I	1
possess,	1
Where	1
thoughts	1
and	1
feelings	1
dwell,	1
And	1
very	1
hard	1
I	1
find	1
the	1
task	1
Of	1
governing	1
it	1
well;	1
For	1
passion	1
tempts	1
and	1
troubles	1
me,	1
A	1
wayward	1
will	1
misleads,	1
And	1
selfishness	1
its	1
shadow	1
casts	1
On	1
all	1
my	1
words	1
and	1
deeds.	1
How	1
can	1
I	1
learn	1
to	1
rule	1
myself,	1
To	1
be	1
the	1
child	1
I	1
should,	1
Honest	1
and	1
brave,	1
nor	1
ever	1
tire	1
Of	1
trying	1
to	1
be	1
good?	1
How	1
can	1
I	1
keep	1
a	1
sunny	1
soul	1
To	1
shine	1
along	1
life's	1
way?	1
How	1
can	1
I	1
tune	1
my	1
little	1
heart	1
To	1
sweetly	1
sing	1
all	1
day?	1
Dear	1
Father,	1
help	1
me	1
with	1
the	1
love	1
That	1
casteth	1
out	1
my	1
fear,	1
Teach	1
me	1
to	1
lean	1
on	1
Thee,	1
and	1
feel	1
That	1
Thou	1
art	1
very	1
near,	1
That	1
no	1
temptation	1
is	1
unseen,	1
No	1
childish	1
grief	1
too	1
small,	1
Since	1
Thou,	1
with	1
patience	1
infinite,	1
Doth	1
soothe	1
and	1
comfort	1
all.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
ask	1
for	1
any	1
crown	1
But	1
that	1
which	1
all	1
may	1
win,	1
Nor	1
seek	1
to	1
conquer	1
any	1
world,	1
Except	1
the	1
one	1
within.	1
Be	1
Thou	1
my	1
Guide	1
until	1
I	1
find,	1
Led	1
by	1
a	1
tender	1
hand,	1
Thy	1
happy	1
kingdom	1
in	1
_myself_,	1
And	1
dare	1
to	1
take	1
command.	1
PICCOLA	1
Poor,	1
sweet	1
Piccola!	1
Did	1
you	1
hear	1
What	1
happened	1
to	1
Piccola,	1
children	1
dear?	1
'Tis	1
seldom	1
Fortune	1
such	1
favour	1
grants	1
As	1
fell	1
to	1
this	1
little	1
maid	1
of	1
France.	1
'Twas	1
Christmas-time,	1
and	1
her	1
parents	1
poor	1
Could	1
hardly	1
drive	1
the	1
wolf	1
from	1
the	1
door,	1
Striving	1
with	1
poverty's	1
patient	1
pain	1
Only	1
to	1
live	1
till	1
summer	1
again.	1
No	1
gifts	1
for	1
Piccola!	1
Sad	1
were	1
they	1
When	1
dawned	1
the	1
morning	1
of	1
Christmas-day;	1
Their	1
little	1
darling	1
no	1
joy	1
might	1
stir,	1
St	1
Nicholas	1
nothing	1
would	1
bring	1
to	1
her!	1
But	1
Piccola	1
never	1
doubted	1
at	1
all	1
That	1
something	1
beautiful	1
must	1
befall	1
Every	1
child	1
upon	1
Christmas-day,	1
And	1
so	1
she	1
slept	1
till	1
the	1
dawn	1
was	1
gray.	1
And	1
full	1
of	1
faith,	1
when	1
at	1
last	1
she	1
woke,	1
She	1
stole	1
to	1
her	1
shoe	1
as	1
the	1
morning	1
broke;	1
Such	1
sounds	1
of	1
gladness	1
filled	1
all	1
the	1
air,	1
Twas	1
plain	1
St	1
Nicholas	1
had	1
been	1
there!	1
In	1
rushed	1
Piccola	1
sweet,	1
half	1
wild:	1
Never	1
was	1
seen	1
such	1
a	1
joyful	1
child.	1
"See	1
what	1
the	1
good	1
saint	1
brought!"	1
she	1
cried,	1
And	1
mother	1
and	1
father	1
must	1
peep	1
inside.	1
Now	1
such	1
a	1
story	1
who	1
ever	1
heard?	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
shivering	1
bird!	1
A	1
sparrow,	1
that	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
window	1
flew,	1
Had	1
crept	1
into	1
Piccola's	1
tiny	1
shoe!	1
"How	1
good	1
poor	1
Piccola	1
must	1
have	1
been!"	1
She	1
cried,	1
as	1
happy	1
as	1
any	1
queen,	1
While	1
the	1
starving	1
sparrow	1
she	1
fed	1
and	1
warmed,	1
And	1
danced	1
with	1
rapture,	1
she	1
was	1
so	1
charmed.	1
Children,	1
this	1
story	1
I	1
tell	1
to	1
you,	1
Of	1
Piccola	1
sweet	1
and	1
her	1
bird,	1
is	1
true.	1
In	1
the	1
far-off	1
land	1
of	1
France,	1
they	1
say,	1
Still	1
do	1
they	1
live	1
to	1
this	1
very	1
day.	1
THE	1
LITTLE	1
FIR	1
TREE	1
When	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
little	1
girl	1
some	1
one,	1
probably	1
my	1
mother,	1
read	1
to	1
me	1
Hans	1
Christian	1
Andersen's	1
story	1
of	1
the	1
Little	1
Fir	1
Tree.	1
It	1
happened	1
that	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
read	1
it	1
for	1
myself	1
or	1
hear	1
it	1
again	1
during	1
my	1
childhood.	1
One	1
Christmas	1
Day,	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
grown	1
up,	1
I	1
found	1
myself	1
at	1
a	1
loss	1
for	1
the	1
"one	1
more"	1
story	1
called	1
for	1
by	1
some	1
little	1
children	1
with	1
whom	1
I	1
was	1
spending	1
the	1
holiday.	1
In	1
the	1
mental	1
search	1
for	1
buried	1
treasure	1
which	1
ensued,	1
I	1
came	1
upon	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
word-impressions	1
of	1
the	1
experiences	1
of	1
the	1
Little	1
Fir	1
Tree,	1
and	1
forthwith	1
wove	1
them	1
into	1
what	1
I	1
supposed	1
to	1
be	1
something	1
of	1
a	1
reproduction	1
of	1
the	1
original.	1
The	1
latter	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
story	1
had	1
wholly	1
faded	1
from	1
my	1
memory,	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
"made	1
up"	1
to	1
suit	1
the	1
tastes	1
of	1
my	1
audience.	1
Afterward	1
I	1
told	1
the	1
story	1
to	1
a	1
good	1
many	1
children,	1
at	1
one	1
time	1
or	1
another,	1
and	1
it	1
gradually	1
took	1
the	1
shape	1
it	1
has	1
here.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
until	1
several	1
years	1
later	1
that,	1
in	1
rereading	1
Andersen	1
for	1
other	1
purposes,	1
I	1
came	1
upon	1
the	1
real	1
story	1
of	1
the	1
Little	1
Fir	1
Tree,	1
and	1
read	1
it	1
for	1
myself.	1
Then	1
indeed	1
I	1
was	1
amused,	1
and	1
somewhat	1
distressed,	1
to	1
find	1
how	1
far	1
I	1
had	1
wandered	1
from	1
the	1
text.	1
I	1
give	1
this	1
explanation	1
that	1
the	1
reader	1
may	1
know	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
presume	1
to	1
offer	1
the	1
little	1
tale	1
which	1
follows	1
as	1
an	1
"adaptation"	1
of	1
Andersen's	1
famous	1
story.	1
I	1
offer	1
it	1
plainly	1
as	1
a	1
story	1
which	1
children	1
have	1
liked,	1
and	1
which	1
grew	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
early	1
memories	1
of	1
Andersen's	1
_The	1
Little	1
Fir	1
Tree_.	1
Once	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
Little	1
Fir	1
Tree,	1
slim	1
and	1
pointed,	1
and	1
shiny,	1
which	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
great	1
forest	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
some	1
big	1
fir	1
trees,	1
broad,	1
and	1
tall,	1
and	1
shadowy	1
green.	1
The	1
Little	1
Fir	1
Tree	1
was	1
very	1
unhappy	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
big	1
like	1
the	1
others.	1
When	1
the	1
birds	1
came	1
flying	1
into	1
the	1
woods	1
and	1
lit	1
on	1
the	1
branches	1
of	1
the	1
big	1
trees	1
and	1
built	1
their	1
nests	1
there,	1
he	1
used	1
to	1
call	1
up	1
to	1
them,--	1
"Come	1
down,	1
come	1
down,	1
rest	1
in	1
my	1
branches!"	1
But	1
they	1
always	1
said,--	1
"Oh,	1
no,	1
no;	1
you	1
are	1
too	1
little!"	1
When	1
the	1
splendid	1
wind	1
came	1
blowing	1
and	1
singing	1
through	1
the	1
forest,	1
it	1
bent	1
and	1
rocked	1
and	1
swung	1
the	1
tops	1
of	1
the	1
big	1
trees,	1
and	1
murmured	1
to	1
them.	1
Then	1
the	1
Little	1
Fir	1
Tree	1
looked	1
up,	1
and	1
called,--	1
"Oh,	1
please,	1
dear	1
wind,	1
come	1
down	1
and	1
play	1
with	1
me!"	1
But	1
he	1
always	1
said,--	1
"Oh,	1
no;	1
you	1
are	1
too	1
little,	1
you	1
are	1
too	1
little!"	1
In	1
the	1
winter	1
the	1
white	1
snow	1
fell	1
softly,	1
softly,	1
and	1
covered	1
the	1
great	1
trees	1
all	1
over	1
with	1
wonderful	1
caps	1
and	1
coats	1
of	1
white.	1
The	1
Little	1
Fir	1
Tree,	1
close	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
cover	1
of	1
the	1
others,	1
would	1
call	1
up,--	1
"Oh,	1
please,	1
dear	1
snow,	1
give	1
me	1
a	1
cap,	1
too!	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
play,	1
too!"	1
But	1
the	1
snow	1
always	1
said,--	1
"Oh	1
no,	1
no,	1
no;	1
you	1
are	1
too	1
little,	1
you	1
are	1
too	1
little!"	1
The	1
worst	1
of	1
all	1
was	1
when	1
men	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
wood,	1
with	1
sledges	1
and	1
teams	1
of	1
horses.	1
They	1
came	1
to	1
cut	1
the	1
big	1
trees	1
down	1
and	1
carry	1
them	1
away.	1
Whenever	1
one	1
had	1
been	1
cut	1
down	1
and	1
carried	1
away	1
the	1
others	1
talked	1
about	1
it,	1
and	1
nodded	1
their	1
heads,	1
and	1
the	1
Little	1
Fir	1
Tree	1
listened,	1
and	1
heard	1
them	1
say	1
that	1
when	1
you	1
were	1
carried	1
away	1
so,	1
you	1
might	1
become	1
the	1
mast	1
of	1
a	1
mighty	1
ship,	1
and	1
go	1
far	1
away	1
over	1
the	1
ocean,	1
and	1
see	1
many	1
wonderful	1
things;	1
or	1
you	1
might	1
be	1
part	1
of	1
a	1
fine	1
house	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
city,	1
and	1
see	1
much	1
of	1
life.	1
The	1
Little	1
Fir	1
Tree	1
wanted	1
greatly	1
to	1
see	1
life,	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
always	1
too	1
little;	1
the	1
men	1
passed	1
him	1
by.	1
But	1
by	1
and	1
by,	1
one	1
cold	1
winter's	1
morning,	1
men	1
came	1
with	1
a	1
sledge	1
and	1
horses,	1
and	1
after	1
they	1
had	1
cut	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
circle	1
of	1
trees	1
round	1
the	1
Little	1
Fir	1
Tree,	1
and	1
looked	1
all	1
about.	1
"There	1
are	1
none	1
little	1
enough,"	1
they	1
said.	1
Oh!	1
how	1
the	1
Little	1
Fir	1
Tree	1
pricked	1
up	1
his	1
needles!	1
"Here	1
is	1
one,"	1
said	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
men,	1
"it	1
is	1
just	1
little	1
enough."	1
And	1
he	1
touched	1
the	1
Little	1
Fir	1
Tree.	1
The	1
Little	1
Fir	1
Tree	1
was	1
happy	1
as	1
a	1
bird,	1
because	1
he	1
knew	1
they	1
were	1
about	1
to	1
cut	1
him	1
down.	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
being	1
carried	1
away	1
on	1
the	1
sledge	1
he	1
lay	1
wondering,	1
_so_	1
contentedly,	1
whether	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
the	1
mast	1
of	1
a	1
ship	1
or	1
part	1
of	1
a	1
fine	1
city	1
house.	1
But	1
when	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
town	1
he	1
was	1
taken	1
out	1
and	1
set	1
upright	1
in	1
a	1
tub	1
and	1
placed	1
on	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
a	1
path	1
in	1
a	1
row	1
of	1
other	1
fir	1
trees,	1
all	1
small,	1
but	1
none	1
so	1
little	1
as	1
he.	1
And	1
then	1
the	1
Little	1
Fir	1
Tree	1
began	1
to	1
see	1
life.	1
People	1
kept	1
coming	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
trees	1
and	1
to	1
take	1
them	1
away.	1
But	1
always	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
the	1
Little	1
Fir	1
Tree	1
they	1
shook	1
their	1
heads	1
and	1
said,--	1
"It	1
is	1
too	1
little,	1
too	1
little."	1
Until,	1
finally,	1
two	1
children	1
came	1
along,	1
hand	1
in	1
hand,	1
looking	1
carefully	1
at	1
all	1
the	1
small	1
trees.	1
When	1
they	1
saw	1
the	1
Little	1
Fir	1
Tree	1
they	1
cried	1
out,--	1
"We'll	1
take	1
this	1
one;	1
it	1
is	1
just	1
little	1
enough!"	1
They	1
took	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
tub	1
and	1
carried	1
him	1
away,	1
between	1
them.	1
And	1
the	1
happy	1
Little	1
Fir	1
Tree	1
spent	1
all	1
his	1
time	1
wondering	1
what	1
it	1
could	1
be	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
just	1
little	1
enough	1
for;	1
he	1
knew	1
it	1
could	1
hardly	1
be	1
a	1
mast	1
or	1
a	1
house,	1
since	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
away	1
with	1
children.	1
He	1
kept	1
wondering,	1
while	1
they	1
took	1
him	1
in	1
through	1
some	1
big	1
doors,	1
and	1
set	1
him	1
up	1
in	1
another	1
tub,	1
on	1
the	1
table,	1
in	1
a	1
bare	1
little	1
room.	1
Very	1
soon	1
they	1
went	1
away,	1
and	1
came	1
back	1
again	1
with	1
a	1
big	1
basket,	1
which	1
they	1
carried	1
between	1
them.	1
Then	1
some	1
pretty	1
ladies,	1
with	1
white	1
caps	1
on	1
their	1
heads	1
and	1
white	1
aprons	1
over	1
their	1
blue	1
dresses,	1
came	1
bringing	1
little	1
parcels.	1
The	1
children	1
took	1
things	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
basket	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
play	1
with	1
the	1
Little	1
Fir	1
Tree,	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
often	1
begged	1
the	1
wind	1
and	1
the	1
snow	1
and	1
the	1
birds	1
to	1
do.	1
He	1
felt	1
their	1
soft	1
little	1
touches	1
on	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
his	1
twigs	1
and	1
his	1
branches.	1
When	1
he	1
looked	1
down	1
at	1
himself,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
look,	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
all	1
hung	1
with	1
gold	1
and	1
silver	1
chains!	1
There	1
were	1
strings	1
of	1
white	1
fluffy	1
stuff	1
drooping	1
around	1
him;	1
his	1
twigs	1
held	1
little	1
gold	1
nuts	1
and	1
pink,	1
rosy	1
balls	1
and	1
silver	1
stars;	1
he	1
had	1
pretty	1
little	1
pink	1
and	1
white	1
candles	1
in	1
his	1
arms;	1
but	1
last,	1
and	1
most	1
wonderful	1
of	1
all,	1
the	1
children	1
hung	1
a	1
beautiful	1
white,	1
floating	1
doll-angel	1
over	1
his	1
head!	1
The	1
Little	1
Fir	1
Tree	1
could	1
not	1
breathe,	1
for	1
joy	1
and	1
wonder.	1
What	1
was	1
it	1
that	1
he	1
was,	1
now?	1
Why	1
was	1
this	1
glory	1
for	1
him?	1
After	1
a	1
time	1
every	1
one	1
went	1
away	1
and	1
left	1
him.	1
It	1
grew	1
dusk,	1
and	1
the	1
Little	1
Fir	1
Tree	1
began	1
to	1
hear	1
strange	1
sounds	1
through	1
the	1
closed	1
doors.	1
Sometimes	1
he	1
heard	1
a	1
child	1
crying.	1
He	1
was	1
beginning	1
to	1
be	1
lonely.	1
It	1
grew	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
shadowy.	1
All	1
at	1
once,	1
the	1
doors	1
opened	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
children	1
came	1
in.	1
Two	1
of	1
the	1
pretty	1
ladies	1
were	1
with	1
them.	1
They	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
Little	1
Fir	1
Tree	1
and	1
quickly	1
lighted	1
all	1
the	1
little	1
pink	1
and	1
white	1
candles.	1
Then	1
the	1
two	1
pretty	1
ladies	1
took	1
hold	1
of	1
the	1
table	1
with	1
the	1
Little	1
Fir	1
Tree	1
on	1
it	1
and	1
pushed	1
it,	1
very	1
smoothly	1
and	1
quickly,	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
doors,	1
across	1
a	1
hall,	1
and	1
in	1
at	1
another	1
door.	1
The	1
Little	1
Fir	1
Tree	1
had	1
a	1
sudden	1
sight	1
of	1
a	1
long	1
room	1
with	1
many	1
little	1
white	1
beds	1
in	1
it,	1
of	1
children	1
propped	1
up	1
on	1
pillows	1
in	1
the	1
beds,	1
and	1
of	1
other	1
children	1
in	1
great	1
wheeled	1
chairs,	1
and	1
others	1
hobbling	1
about	1
or	1
sitting	1
in	1
little	1
chairs.	1
He	1
wondered	1
why	1
all	1
the	1
little	1
children	1
looked	1
so	1
white	1
and	1
tired;	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
hospital.	1
But	1
before	1
he	1
could	1
wonder	1
any	1
more	1
his	1
breath	1
was	1
quite	1
taken	1
away	1
by	1
the	1
shout	1
those	1
little	1
white	1
children	1
gave.	1
"Oh!	1
oh!	1
m-m!	1
m-m!"	1
they	1
cried.	1
"How	1
pretty!	1
How	1
beautiful!	1
Oh,	1
isn't	1
it	1
lovely!"	1
He	1
knew	1
they	1
must	1
mean	1
him,	1
for	1
all	1
their	1
shining	1
eyes	1
were	1
looking	1
straight	1
at	1
him.	1
He	1
stood	1
as	1
straight	1
as	1
a	1
mast,	1
and	1
quivered	1
in	1
every	1
needle,	1
for	1
joy.	1
Presently	1
one	1
little	1
weak	1
child-voice	1
called	1
out,--	1
"It's	1
the	1
nicest	1
Christmas	1
tree	1
I	1
ever	1
saw!"	1
And	1
then,	1
at	1
last,	1
the	1
Little	1
Fir	1
Tree	1
knew	1
what	1
he	1
was;	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
Christmas	1
tree!	1
And	1
from	1
his	1
shiny	1
head	1
to	1
his	1
feet	1
he	1
was	1
glad,	1
through	1
and	1
through,	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
just	1
little	1
enough	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
nicest	1
kind	1
of	1
tree	1
in	1
the	1
world!	1
HOW	1
MOSES	1
WAS	1
SAVED	1
Thousands	1
of	1
years	1
ago,	1
many	1
years	1
before	1
David	1
lived,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
wise	1
and	1
good	1
man	1
of	1
his	1
people	1
who	1
was	1
a	1
friend	1
and	1
adviser	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
And	1
for	1
love	1
of	1
this	1
friend,	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Egypt	1
had	1
let	1
numbers	1
of	1
the	1
Israelites	1
settle	1
in	1
his	1
land.	1
But	1
after	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
his	1
Israelitish	1
friend	1
were	1
dead,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
new	1
king,	1
who	1
hated	1
the	1
Israelites.	1
When	1
he	1
saw	1
how	1
strong	1
they	1
were,	1
and	1
how	1
many	1
there	1
were	1
of	1
them,	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
afraid	1
that	1
some	1
day	1
they	1
might	1
number	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
Egyptians,	1
and	1
might	1
take	1
his	1
land	1
from	1
him.	1
Then	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
rulers	1
did	1
a	1
wicked	1
thing.	1
They	1
made	1
the	1
Israelites	1
slaves.	1
And	1
they	1
gave	1
them	1
terrible	1
tasks	1
to	1
do,	1
without	1
proper	1
rest,	1
or	1
food,	1
or	1
clothes.	1
For	1
they	1
hoped	1
that	1
the	1
hardship	1
would	1
kill	1
off	1
the	1
Israelites.	1
They	1
thought	1
the	1
old	1
men	1
would	1
die	1
and	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
be	1
so	1
ill	1
and	1
weary	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
bring	1
up	1
families,	1
and	1
so	1
the	1
race	1
would	1
dwindle	1
away.	1
But	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
work	1
and	1
suffering,	1
the	1
Israelites	1
remained	1
strong,	1
and	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
boys	1
grew	1
up,	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
king	1
afraid.	1
Then	1
he	1
did	1
the	1
most	1
wicked	1
thing	1
of	1
all.	1
He	1
ordered	1
his	1
soldiers	1
to	1
kill	1
every	1
boy	1
baby	1
that	1
should	1
be	1
born	1
in	1
an	1
Israelitish	1
family;	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
care	1
about	1
the	1
girls,	1
because	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
grow	1
up	1
to	1
fight.	1
Very	1
soon	1
after	1
this	1
wicked	1
order,	1
a	1
boy	1
baby	1
was	1
born	1
in	1
a	1
certain	1
Israelitish	1
family.	1
When	1
his	1
mother	1
first	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
her	1
heart	1
was	1
nearly	1
broken,	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
even	1
more	1
beautiful	1
than	1
most	1
babies	1
are,--so	1
strong	1
and	1
fair	1
and	1
sweet.	1
But	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
boy!	1
How	1
could	1
she	1
save	1
him	1
from	1
death?	1
Somehow,	1
she	1
contrived	1
to	1
keep	1
him	1
hidden	1
for	1
three	1
whole	1
months.	1
But	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
that	1
time,	1
she	1
saw	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
possible	1
to	1
keep	1
him	1
safe	1
any	1
longer.	1
She	1
had	1
been	1
thinking	1
all	1
this	1
time	1
about	1
what	1
she	1
should	1
do,	1
and	1
now	1
she	1
carried	1
out	1
her	1
plan.	1
First,	1
she	1
took	1
a	1
basket	1
made	1
of	1
bulrushes	1
and	1
daubed	1
it	1
all	1
over	1
with	1
pitch,	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
water-tight,	1
and	1
then	1
she	1
laid	1
the	1
baby	1
in	1
it;	1
then	1
she	1
carried	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
river	1
and	1
laid	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
flags	1
by	1
the	1
river's	1
brink.	1
It	1
did	1
not	1
show	1
at	1
all,	1
unless	1
one	1
were	1
quite	1
near	1
it.	1
Then	1
she	1
kissed	1
her	1
little	1
son	1
and	1
left	1
him	1
there.	1
But	1
his	1
sister	1
stood	1
far	1
off,	1
not	1
seeming	1
to	1
watch,	1
but	1
really	1
watching	1
carefully	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
would	1
happen	1
to	1
the	1
baby.	1
Soon	1
there	1
was	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
talk	1
and	1
laughter,	1
and	1
a	1
train	1
of	1
beautiful	1
women	1
came	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
water's	1
edge.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
king's	1
daughter,	1
come	1
down	1
to	1
bathe	1
in	1
the	1
river,	1
with	1
her	1
maidens.	1
The	1
maidens	1
walked	1
along	1
by	1
the	1
river	1
side.	1
As	1
the	1
king's	1
daughter	1
came	1
near	1
to	1
the	1
water,	1
she	1
saw	1
the	1
strange	1
little	1
basket	1
lying	1
in	1
the	1
flags,	1
and	1
she	1
sent	1
her	1
maid	1
to	1
bring	1
it	1
to	1
her.	1
And	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
opened	1
it,	1
she	1
saw	1
the	1
child;	1
the	1
poor	1
baby	1
was	1
crying.	1
When	1
she	1
saw	1
him,	1
so	1
helpless	1
and	1
so	1
beautiful,	1
crying	1
for	1
his	1
mother,	1
the	1
king's	1
daughter	1
pitied	1
him	1
and	1
loved	1
him.	1
She	1
knew	1
the	1
cruel	1
order	1
of	1
her	1
father,	1
and	1
she	1
said	1
at	1
once,	1
"This	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
Hebrews'	1
children."	1
At	1
that	1
moment	1
the	1
baby's	1
sister	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
princess	1
and	1
said,	1
"Shall	1
I	1
go	1
and	1
find	1
thee	1
a	1
nurse	1
from	1
the	1
Hebrew	1
women,	1
so	1
that	1
she	1
may	1
nurse	1
the	1
child	1
for	1
thee?"	1
Not	1
a	1
word	1
did	1
she	1
say	1
about	1
whose	1
child	1
it	1
was,	1
but	1
perhaps	1
the	1
princess	1
guessed;	1
I	1
don't	1
know.	1
At	1
all	1
events,	1
she	1
told	1
the	1
little	1
girl	1
to	1
go.	1
So	1
the	1
maiden	1
went,	1
and	1
brought	1
her	1
mother!	1
Then	1
the	1
king's	1
daughter	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
baby's	1
mother,	1
"Take	1
this	1
child	1
away	1
and	1
nurse	1
it	1
for	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
thee	1
wages."	1
Was	1
not	1
that	1
a	1
strange	1
thing?	1
And	1
can	1
you	1
think	1
how	1
happy	1
the	1
baby's	1
mother	1
was?	1
For	1
now	1
the	1
baby	1
would	1
be	1
known	1
only	1
as	1
the	1
princess's	1
adopted	1
child,	1
and	1
would	1
be	1
safe.	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
so.	1
The	1
mother	1
kept	1
him	1
until	1
he	1
was	1
old	1
enough	1
to	1
be	1
taken	1
to	1
the	1
princess's	1
palace.	1
Then	1
he	1
was	1
brought	1
and	1
given	1
to	1
the	1
king's	1
daughter,	1
and	1
he	1
became	1
her	1
son.	1
And	1
she	1
named	1
him	1
Moses.	1
But	1
the	1
strangest	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
story	1
is,	1
that	1
when	1
Moses	1
grew	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
man	1
he	1
became	1
so	1
strong	1
and	1
wise	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
he	1
who	1
at	1
last	1
saved	1
his	1
people	1
from	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
rescued	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
Egyptians.	1
The	1
one	1
child	1
saved	1
by	1
the	1
king's	1
own	1
daughter	1
was	1
the	1
very	1
one	1
the	1
king	1
would	1
most	1
have	1
wanted	1
to	1
kill,	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
known.	1
THE	1
TEN	1
FAIRIES	1
Once	1
upon	1
a	1
time	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
dear	1
little	1
girl,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Elsa.	1
Elsa's	1
father	1
and	1
mother	1
worked	1
very	1
hard	1
and	1
became	1
rich.	1
But	1
they	1
loved	1
Elsa	1
so	1
much	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
her	1
to	1
do	1
any	1
work;	1
very	1
foolishly,	1
they	1
let	1
her	1
play	1
all	1
the	1
time.	1
So	1
when	1
Elsa	1
grew	1
up,	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
do	1
anything;	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
make	1
bread,	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
sweep	1
a	1
room,	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
sew	1
a	1
seam;	1
she	1
could	1
only	1
laugh	1
and	1
sing.	1
But	1
she	1
was	1
so	1
sweet	1
and	1
merry	1
that	1
everybody	1
loved	1
her.	1
And	1
by	1
and	1
by,	1
she	1
married	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
loved	1
her,	1
and	1
had	1
a	1
house	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
to	1
take	1
care	1
of.	1
Then,	1
then,	1
my	1
dears,	1
came	1
hard	1
times	1
for	1
Elsa!	1
There	1
were	1
so	1
many	1
things	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
in	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
do	1
any	1
of	1
them!	1
And	1
because	1
she	1
had	1
never	1
worked	1
at	1
all	1
it	1
made	1
her	1
very	1
tired	1
even	1
to	1
try;	1
she	1
was	1
tired	1
before	1
the	1
morning	1
was	1
over,	1
every	1
day.	1
The	1
maid	1
would	1
come	1
and	1
say,	1
"How	1
shall	1
I	1
do	1
this?"	1
or	1
"How	1
shall	1
I	1
do	1
that?"	1
and	1
Elsa	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
say,	1
"I	1
don't	1
know."	1
Then	1
the	1
maid	1
would	1
pretend	1
that	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
know,	1
either;	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
her	1
mistress	1
sitting	1
about	1
doing	1
nothing,	1
she,	1
too,	1
sat	1
about,	1
idle.	1
Elsa's	1
husband	1
had	1
a	1
hard	1
time	1
of	1
it;	1
he	1
had	1
only	1
poor	1
food	1
to	1
eat,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
ready	1
at	1
the	1
right	1
time,	1
and	1
the	1
house	1
looked	1
all	1
in	1
a	1
muddle.	1
It	1
made	1
him	1
sad,	1
and	1
that	1
made	1
Elsa	1
sad,	1
for	1
she	1
wanted	1
to	1
do	1
everything	1
just	1
right.	1
At	1
last,	1
one	1
day,	1
Elsa's	1
husband	1
went	1
away	1
quite	1
cross;	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
her,	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
door,	1
"It	1
is	1
no	1
wonder	1
that	1
the	1
house	1
looks	1
so,	1
when	1
you	1
sit	1
all	1
day	1
with	1
your	1
hands	1
in	1
your	1
lap!"	1
Little	1
Elsa	1
cried	1
bitterly	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
gone,	1
for	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
husband	1
unhappy	1
and	1
cross,	1
and	1
she	1
wanted	1
the	1
house	1
to	1
look	1
nice.	1
"Oh,	1
dear,"	1
she	1
sobbed,	1
"I	1
wish	1
I	1
could	1
do	1
things	1
right!	1
I	1
wish	1
I	1
could	1
work!	1
I	1
wish--I	1
wish	1
I	1
had	1
ten	1
good	1
fairies	1
to	1
work	1
for	1
me!	1
Then	1
I	1
could	1
keep	1
the	1
house!"	1
As	1
she	1
said	1
the	1
words,	1
a	1
great	1
grey	1
man	1
stood	1
before	1
her;	1
he	1
was	1
wrapped	1
in	1
a	1
strange	1
grey	1
cloak	1
that	1
covered	1
him	1
from	1
head	1
to	1
foot;	1
and	1
he	1
smiled	1
at	1
Elsa.	1
"What	1
is	1
the	1
matter,	1
dear?"	1
he	1
said.	1
"Why	1
do	1
you	1
cry?"	1
"Oh,	1
I	1
am	1
crying	1
because	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
house,"	1
said	1
Elsa.	1
"I	1
cannot	1
make	1
bread,	1
I	1
cannot	1
sweep,	1
I	1
cannot	1
sew	1
a	1
seam;	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
girl	1
I	1
never	1
learned	1
to	1
work,	1
and	1
now	1
I	1
cannot	1
do	1
anything	1
right.	1
I	1
wish	1
I	1
had	1
ten	1
good	1
fairies	1
to	1
help	1
me!"	1
"You	1
shall	1
have	1
them,	1
dear,"	1
said	1
the	1
grey	1
man,	1
and	1
he	1
shook	1
his	1
strange	1
grey	1
cloak.	1
Pouf!	1
Out	1
hopped	1
ten	1
tiny	1
fairies,	1
no	1
bigger	1
than	1
that!	1
"These	1
shall	1
be	1
your	1
servants,	1
Elsa,"	1
said	1
the	1
grey	1
man;	1
"they	1
are	1
faithful	1
and	1
clever,	1
and	1
they	1
will	1
do	1
everything	1
you	1
want	1
them	1
to,	1
just	1
right.	1
But	1
the	1
neighbours	1
might	1
stare	1
and	1
ask	1
questions	1
if	1
they	1
saw	1
these	1
little	1
chaps	1
running	1
about	1
your	1
house,	1
so	1
I	1
will	1
hide	1
them	1
away	1
for	1
you.	1
Give	1
me	1
your	1
little	1
useless	1
hands."	1
Wondering,	1
Elsa	1
stretched	1
out	1
her	1
pretty,	1
little,	1
white	1
hands.	1
"Now	1
stretch	1
out	1
your	1
little	1
useless	1
fingers,	1
dear!"	1
Elsa	1
stretched	1
out	1
her	1
pretty	1
pink	1
fingers.	1
The	1
grey	1
man	1
touched	1
each	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
ten	1
little	1
fingers,	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
touched	1
them	1
he	1
said	1
their	1
names:	1
"Little	1
Thumb;	1
Forefinger;	1
Thimble-finger;	1
Ring-finger;	1
Little	1
Finger;	1
Little	1
Thumb;	1
Forefinger;	1
Thimble-finger;	1
Ring-finger;	1
Little	1
Finger!"	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
named	1
the	1
fingers,	1
one	1
after	1
another,	1
the	1
tiny	1
fairies	1
bowed	1
their	1
tiny	1
heads;	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
fairy	1
for	1
every	1
name.	1
"Hop!	1
hide	1
yourselves	1
away!"	1
said	1
the	1
grey	1
man.	1
Hop,	1
hop!	1
The	1
fairies	1
sprang	1
to	1
Elsa's	1
knee,	1
then	1
to	1
the	1
palms	1
of	1
her	1
hands,	1
and	1
then--whisk!	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
hidden	1
away	1
in	1
her	1
little	1
pink	1
fingers,	1
a	1
fairy	1
in	1
every	1
finger!	1
And	1
the	1
grey	1
man	1
was	1
gone.	1
Elsa	1
sat	1
and	1
looked	1
with	1
wonder	1
at	1
her	1
little	1
white	1
hands	1
and	1
the	1
ten	1
useless	1
fingers.	1
But	1
suddenly	1
the	1
little	1
fingers	1
began	1
to	1
stir.	1
The	1
tiny	1
fairies	1
who	1
were	1
hidden	1
away	1
there	1
were	1
not	1
used	1
to	1
remaining	1
still,	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
getting	1
restless.	1
They	1
stirred	1
so	1
that	1
Elsa	1
jumped	1
up	1
and	1
ran	1
to	1
the	1
cooking	1
table,	1
and	1
took	1
hold	1
of	1
the	1
bread	1
board.	1
No	1
sooner	1
had	1
she	1
touched	1
the	1
bread	1
board	1
than	1
the	1
little	1
fairies	1
began	1
to	1
work:	1
they	1
measured	1
the	1
flour,	1
mixed	1
the	1
bread,	1
kneaded	1
the	1
loaves,	1
and	1
set	1
them	1
to	1
rise,	1
quicker	1
than	1
you	1
could	1
wink;	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
bread	1
was	1
done,	1
it	1
was	1
as	1
nice	1
as	1
you	1
could	1
wish.	1
Then	1
the	1
little	1
fairy-fingers	1
seized	1
the	1
broom,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
twinkling	1
they	1
were	1
making	1
the	1
house	1
clean.	1
And	1
so	1
it	1
went,	1
all	1
day.	1
Elsa	1
flew	1
about	1
from	1
one	1
thing	1
to	1
another,	1
and	1
the	1
ten	1
fairies	1
did	1
the	1
work,	1
just	1
right.	1
When	1
the	1
maid	1
saw	1
her	1
mistress	1
working,	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
work,	1
too;	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
how	1
beautifully	1
everything	1
was	1
done,	1
she	1
was	1
ashamed	1
to	1
do	1
anything	1
badly	1
herself.	1
In	1
a	1
little	1
while	1
the	1
housework	1
was	1
going	1
smoothly,	1
and	1
Elsa	1
could	1
laugh	1
and	1
sing	1
again.	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
more	1
crossness	1
in	1
that	1
house.	1
Elsa's	1
husband	1
grew	1
so	1
proud	1
of	1
her	1
that	1
he	1
went	1
about	1
saying	1
to	1
everybody,	1
"My	1
grandmother	1
was	1
a	1
fine	1
housekeeper,	1
and	1
my	1
mother	1
was	1
a	1
fine	1
housekeeper,	1
but	1
neither	1
of	1
them	1
could	1
hold	1
a	1
candle	1
to	1
my	1
wife.	1
She	1
has	1
only	1
one	1
maid,	1
but,	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
work	1
done,	1
you	1
would	1
think	1
she	1
had	1
as	1
many	1
servants	1
as	1
she	1
has	1
fingers	1
on	1
her	1
hands!"	1
When	1
Elsa	1
heard	1
that,	1
she	1
used	1
to	1
laugh,	1
but	1
she	1
never,	1
never	1
told.	1
THE	1
ELVES	1
AND	1
THE	1
SHOEMAKER	1
Once	1
upon	1
a	1
time	1
there	1
was	1
an	1
honest	1
shoemaker,	1
who	1
was	1
very	1
poor.	1
He	1
worked	1
as	1
hard	1
as	1
he	1
could,	1
and	1
still	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
earn	1
enough	1
to	1
keep	1
himself	1
and	1
his	1
wife.	1
At	1
last	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
day	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
nothing	1
left	1
but	1
one	1
piece	1
of	1
leather,	1
big	1
enough	1
to	1
make	1
one	1
pair	1
of	1
shoes.	1
He	1
cut	1
out	1
the	1
shoes,	1
ready	1
to	1
stitch,	1
and	1
left	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
bench;	1
then	1
he	1
said	1
his	1
prayers	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
bed,	1
trusting	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
finish	1
the	1
shoes	1
on	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
and	1
sell	1
them.	1
Bright	1
and	1
early	1
the	1
next	1
morning,	1
he	1
rose	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
his	1
work	1
bench.	1
There	1
lay	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
shoes,	1
beautifully	1
made,	1
and	1
the	1
leather	1
was	1
gone!	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
sign	1
of	1
anyone	1
having	1
been	1
there.	1
The	1
shoemaker	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
make	1
of	1
it.	1
But	1
the	1
first	1
customer	1
who	1
came	1
was	1
so	1
pleased	1
with	1
the	1
beautiful	1
shoes	1
that	1
he	1
bought	1
them,	1
and	1
paid	1
so	1
much	1
that	1
the	1
shoemaker	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
buy	1
leather	1
enough	1
for	1
two	1
pairs.	1
Happily,	1
he	1
cut	1
them	1
out,	1
and	1
then,	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
late,	1
he	1
left	1
the	1
pieces	1
on	1
the	1
bench,	1
ready	1
to	1
sew	1
in	1
the	1
morning.	1
But	1
when	1
morning	1
came,	1
two	1
pairs	1
of	1
shoes	1
lay	1
on	1
the	1
bench,	1
most	1
beautifully	1
made,	1
and	1
no	1
sign	1
of	1
anyone	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
there.	1
The	1
shoemaker	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
were	1
quite	1
at	1
a	1
loss.	1
That	1
day	1
a	1
customer	1
came	1
and	1
bought	1
both	1
pairs,	1
and	1
paid	1
so	1
much	1
for	1
them	1
that	1
the	1
shoemaker	1
bought	1
leather	1
for	1
four	1
pairs,	1
with	1
the	1
money.	1
Once	1
more	1
he	1
cut	1
out	1
the	1
shoes	1
and	1
left	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
bench.	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
all	1
four	1
pairs	1
were	1
made.	1
It	1
went	1
on	1
like	1
this	1
until	1
the	1
shoemaker	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
were	1
prosperous	1
people.	1
But	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
satisfied	1
to	1
have	1
so	1
much	1
done	1
for	1
them	1
and	1
not	1
know	1
to	1
whom	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
grateful.	1
So	1
one	1
night,	1
after	1
the	1
shoemaker	1
had	1
left	1
the	1
pieces	1
of	1
leather	1
on	1
the	1
bench,	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
hid	1
themselves	1
behind	1
a	1
curtain,	1
and	1
left	1
a	1
light	1
in	1
the	1
room.	1
Just	1
as	1
the	1
clock	1
struck	1
twelve	1
the	1
door	1
opened	1
softly,	1
and	1
two	1
tiny	1
elves	1
came	1
dancing	1
into	1
the	1
room,	1
hopped	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
bench,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
put	1
the	1
pieces	1
together.	1
They	1
were	1
quite	1
naked,	1
but	1
they	1
had	1
wee	1
little	1
scissors	1
and	1
hammers	1
and	1
thread.	1
Tap!	1
tap!	1
went	1
the	1
little	1
hammers;	1
stitch,	1
stitch,	1
went	1
the	1
thread,	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
elves	1
were	1
hard	1
at	1
work.	1
No	1
one	1
ever	1
worked	1
so	1
fast	1
as	1
they.	1
In	1
almost	1
no	1
time	1
all	1
the	1
shoes	1
were	1
stitched	1
and	1
finished.	1
Then	1
the	1
tiny	1
elves	1
took	1
hold	1
of	1
each	1
other's	1
hands	1
and	1
danced	1
round	1
the	1
shoes	1
on	1
the	1
bench,	1
till	1
the	1
shoemaker	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
had	1
hard	1
work	1
not	1
to	1
laugh	1
aloud.	1
But	1
as	1
the	1
clock	1
struck	1
two,	1
the	1
little	1
creatures	1
whisked	1
away	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window,	1
and	1
left	1
the	1
room	1
all	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
before.	1
The	1
shoemaker	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
looked	1
at	1
each	1
other,	1
and	1
said,	1
"How	1
can	1
we	1
thank	1
the	1
little	1
elves	1
who	1
have	1
made	1
us	1
happy	1
and	1
prosperous?"	1
"I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
make	1
them	1
some	1
pretty	1
clothes,"	1
said	1
the	1
wife,	1
"they	1
are	1
quite	1
naked."	1
"I	1
will	1
make	1
the	1
shoes	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
make	1
the	1
coats,"	1
said	1
her	1
husband.	1
That	1
very	1
day	1
they	1
commenced	1
their	1
task.	1
The	1
wife	1
cut	1
out	1
two	1
tiny,	1
tiny	1
coats	1
of	1
green,	1
two	1
weeny,	1
weeny	1
waistcoats	1
of	1
yellow,	1
two	1
little	1
pairs	1
of	1
trousers,	1
of	1
white,	1
two	1
bits	1
of	1
caps,	1
bright	1
red	1
(for	1
every	1
one	1
knows	1
the	1
elves	1
love	1
bright	1
colours),	1
and	1
her	1
husband	1
made	1
two	1
little	1
pairs	1
of	1
shoes	1
with	1
long,	1
pointed	1
toes.	1
They	1
made	1
the	1
wee	1
clothes	1
as	1
dainty	1
as	1
could	1
be,	1
with	1
nice	1
little	1
stitches	1
and	1
pretty	1
buttons;	1
and	1
by	1
Christmas	1
time,	1
they	1
were	1
finished.	1
On	1
Christmas	1
eve,	1
the	1
shoemaker	1
cleaned	1
his	1
bench,	1
and	1
on	1
it,	1
instead	1
of	1
leather,	1
he	1
laid	1
the	1
two	1
sets	1
of	1
gay	1
little	1
fairy-clothes.	1
Then	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
hid	1
away	1
as	1
before,	1
to	1
watch.	1
Promptly	1
at	1
midnight,	1
the	1
little	1
naked	1
elves	1
came	1
in.	1
They	1
hopped	1
upon	1
the	1
bench;	1
but	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
the	1
little	1
clothes	1
there,	1
they	1
laughed	1
and	1
danced	1
for	1
joy.	1
Each	1
one	1
caught	1
up	1
his	1
little	1
coat	1
and	1
things	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
put	1
them	1
on.	1
Then	1
they	1
looked	1
at	1
each	1
other	1
and	1
made	1
all	1
kinds	1
of	1
funny	1
motions	1
in	1
their	1
delight.	1
At	1
last	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
dance,	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
clock	1
struck	1
two,	1
they	1
danced	1
quite	1
away,	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window.	1
They	1
never	1
came	1
back	1
any	1
more,	1
but	1
from	1
that	1
day	1
they	1
gave	1
the	1
shoemaker	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
good	1
luck,	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
never	1
needed	1
any	1
more	1
help.	1
WHO	1
KILLED	1
THE	1
OTTER'S	1
BABIES?	1
Once	1
the	1
Otter	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
Mouse-deer	1
and	1
said,	1
"Friend	1
Mouse-deer,	1
will	1
you	1
please	1
take	1
care	1
of	1
my	1
babies	1
while	1
I	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
river,	1
to	1
catch	1
fish?"	1
"Certainly,"	1
said	1
the	1
Mouse-deer,	1
"go	1
along."	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
Otter	1
came	1
back	1
from	1
the	1
river,	1
with	1
a	1
string	1
of	1
fish,	1
he	1
found	1
his	1
babies	1
crushed	1
flat.	1
"What	1
does	1
this	1
mean,	1
Friend	1
Mouse-deer?"	1
he	1
said.	1
"Who	1
killed	1
my	1
children	1
while	1
you	1
were	1
taking	1
care	1
of	1
them?"	1
"I	1
am	1
very	1
sorry,"	1
said	1
the	1
Mouse-deer,	1
"but	1
you	1
know	1
I	1
am	1
Chief	1
Dancer	1
of	1
the	1
War-dance,	1
and	1
the	1
Woodpecker	1
came	1
and	1
sounded	1
the	1
war-gong,	1
so	1
I	1
danced.	1
I	1
forgot	1
your	1
children,	1
and	1
trod	1
on	1
them."	1
"I	1
shall	1
go	1
to	1
King	1
Solomon,"	1
said	1
the	1
Otter,	1
"and	1
you	1
shall	1
be	1
punished."	1
Soon	1
the	1
Mouse-deer	1
was	1
called	1
before	1
King	1
Solomon.	1
"Did	1
you	1
kill	1
the	1
Otter's	1
babies?"	1
said	1
the	1
king.	1
"Yes,	1
your	1
Majesty,"	1
said	1
the	1
Mouse-deer,	1
"but	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
mean	1
to."	1
"How	1
did	1
it	1
happen?"	1
said	1
the	1
king.	1
"Your	1
Majesty	1
knows,"	1
said	1
the	1
Mouse-deer,	1
"that	1
I	1
am	1
Chief	1
Dancer	1
of	1
the	1
War-dance.	1
The	1
Woodpecker	1
came	1
and	1
sounded	1
the	1
war-gong,	1
and	1
I	1
had	1
to	1
dance;	1
and	1
as	1
I	1
danced	1
I	1
trod	1
on	1
the	1
Otter's	1
children."	1
"Send	1
for	1
the	1
Woodpecker,"	1
said	1
King	1
Solomon.	1
When	1
the	1
Woodpecker	1
came,	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
"Was	1
it	1
you	1
who	1
sounded	1
the	1
war-gong?"	1
"Yes,	1
your	1
Majesty,"	1
said	1
the	1
Woodpecker,	1
"but	1
I	1
had	1
to."	1
"Why?"	1
said	1
the	1
king.	1
"Your	1
Majesty	1
knows,"	1
said	1
the	1
Woodpecker,	1
"that	1
I	1
am	1
Chief	1
Beater	1
of	1
the	1
War-gong,	1
and	1
I	1
sounded	1
the	1
gong	1
because	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
Great	1
Lizard	1
wearing	1
his	1
sword."	1
"Send	1
for	1
the	1
Great	1
Lizard,"	1
said	1
King	1
Solomon.	1
When	1
the	1
Great	1
Lizard	1
came,	1
he	1
asked	1
him,	1
"Was	1
it	1
you	1
who	1
were	1
wearing	1
your	1
sword?"	1
"Yes,	1
your	1
Majesty,"	1
said	1
the	1
Great	1
Lizard;	1
"but	1
I	1
had	1
to."	1
"Why?"	1
said	1
the	1
king.	1
"Your	1
Majesty	1
knows,"	1
said	1
the	1
Great	1
Lizard,	1
"that	1
I	1
am	1
Chief	1
Protector	1
of	1
the	1
Sword.	1
I	1
wore	1
my	1
sword	1
because	1
the	1
Tortoise	1
came	1
wearing	1
his	1
coat	1
of	1
mail."	1
So	1
the	1
Tortoise	1
was	1
sent	1
for.	1
"Why	1
did	1
you	1
wear	1
your	1
coat	1
of	1
mail?"	1
said	1
the	1
king.	1
"I	1
put	1
it	1
on,	1
your	1
Majesty,"	1
said	1
the	1
Tortoise,	1
"because	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
King-crab	1
trailing	1
his	1
three-edged	1
pike."	1
Then	1
the	1
King-crab	1
was	1
sent	1
for.	1
"Why	1
were	1
you	1
trailing	1
your	1
three-edged	1
pike?"	1
said	1
King	1
Solomon.	1
"Because,	1
your	1
Majesty,"	1
said	1
the	1
King-crab,	1
"I	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
Crayfish	1
had	1
shouldered	1
his	1
lance."	1
Immediately	1
the	1
Crayfish	1
was	1
sent	1
for.	1
"Why	1
did	1
you	1
shoulder	1
your	1
lance?"	1
said	1
the	1
king.	1
"Because,	1
your	1
Majesty,"	1
said	1
the	1
Crayfish,	1
"I	1
saw	1
the	1
Otter	1
coming	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
river	1
to	1
kill	1
my	1
children."	1
"Oh,"	1
said	1
King	1
Solomon,	1
"if	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
case,	1
the	1
Otter	1
killed	1
the	1
Otter's	1
children.	1
And	1
the	1
Mouse-deer	1
cannot	1
be	1
blamed,	1
by	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
land!"	1
EARLY	1
I	1
like	1
to	1
lie	1
and	1
wait	1
to	1
see	1
My	1
mother	1
braid	1
her	1
hair.	1
It	1
is	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
it	1
can	1
be,	1
And	1
yet	1
she	1
doesn't	1
care.	1
I	1
love	1
my	1
mother's	1
hair.	1
And	1
then	1
the	1
way	1
her	1
fingers	1
go;	1
They	1
look	1
so	1
quick	1
and	1
white,--	1
In	1
and	1
out,	1
and	1
to	1
and	1
fro,	1
And	1
braiding	1
in	1
the	1
light,	1
And	1
it	1
is	1
always	1
right.	1
So	1
then	1
she	1
winds	1
it,	1
shiny	1
brown,	1
Around	1
her	1
head	1
into	1
a	1
crown,	1
Just	1
like	1
the	1
day	1
before.	1
And	1
then	1
she	1
looks	1
and	1
pats	1
it	1
down,	1
And	1
looks	1
a	1
minute	1
more;	1
While	1
I	1
stay	1
here	1
all	1
still	1
and	1
cool.	1
Oh,	1
isn't	1
morning	1
beautiful?	1
THE	1
BRAHMIN,	1
THE	1
TIGER,	1
AND	1
THE	1
JACKAL	1
Do	1
you	1
know	1
what	1
a	1
Brahmin	1
is?	1
A	1
Brahmin	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
and	1
gentle	1
kind	1
of	1
man	1
who	1
lives	1
in	1
India,	1
and	1
who	1
treats	1
all	1
the	1
beasts	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
his	1
brothers.	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
more	1
to	1
know	1
about	1
Brahmins,	1
but	1
that	1
is	1
enough	1
for	1
the	1
story.	1
One	1
day	1
a	1
Brahmin	1
was	1
walking	1
along	1
a	1
country	1
road	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
upon	1
a	1
Tiger,	1
shut	1
up	1
in	1
a	1
strong	1
iron	1
cage.	1
The	1
villagers	1
had	1
caught	1
him	1
and	1
shut	1
him	1
up	1
there	1
for	1
his	1
wickedness.	1
"Oh,	1
Brother	1
Brahmin,	1
Brother	1
Brahmin,"	1
said	1
the	1
Tiger,	1
"please	1
let	1
me	1
out,	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
little	1
drink!	1
I	1
am	1
so	1
thirsty,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
water	1
here."	1
"But	1
Brother	1
Tiger,"	1
said	1
the	1
Brahmin,	1
"you	1
know	1
if	1
I	1
should	1
let	1
you	1
out,	1
you	1
would	1
spring	1
on	1
me	1
and	1
eat	1
me	1
up."	1
"Never,	1
Brother	1
Brahmin!"	1
said	1
the	1
Tiger.	1
"Never	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
would	1
I	1
do	1
such	1
an	1
ungrateful	1
thing!	1
Just	1
let	1
me	1
out	1
a	1
little	1
minute,	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
little,	1
little	1
drink	1
of	1
water,	1
Brother	1
Brahmin!"	1
So	1
the	1
Brahmin	1
unlocked	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
let	1
the	1
Tiger	1
out.	1
The	1
moment	1
he	1
was	1
out	1
he	1
sprang	1
on	1
the	1
Brahmin,	1
and	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
eat	1
him	1
up.	1
"But,	1
Brother	1
Tiger,"	1
said	1
the	1
Brahmin,	1
"you	1
promised	1
you	1
would	1
not.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
fair	1
or	1
just	1
that	1
you	1
should	1
eat	1
me,	1
when	1
I	1
set	1
you	1
free."	1
"It	1
is	1
perfectly	1
right	1
and	1
just,"	1
said	1
the	1
Tiger,	1
"and	1
I	1
shall	1
eat	1
you	1
up."	1
However,	1
the	1
Brahmin	1
argued	1
so	1
hard	1
that	1
at	1
last	1
the	1
Tiger	1
agreed	1
to	1
wait	1
and	1
ask	1
the	1
first	1
five	1
whom	1
they	1
should	1
meet,	1
whether	1
it	1
was	1
fair	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
eat	1
the	1
Brahmin,	1
and	1
to	1
abide	1
by	1
their	1
decision.	1
The	1
first	1
thing	1
they	1
came	1
to,	1
to	1
ask,	1
was	1
an	1
old	1
Banyan	1
Tree,	1
by	1
the	1
wayside.	1
(A	1
banyan	1
tree	1
is	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
fruit	1
tree.)	1
"Brother	1
Banyan,"	1
said	1
the	1
Brahmin,	1
eagerly,	1
"does	1
it	1
seem	1
to	1
you	1
right	1
or	1
just	1
that	1
this	1
Tiger	1
should	1
eat	1
me,	1
when	1
I	1
set	1
him	1
free	1
from	1
his	1
cage?"	1
The	1
Banyan	1
Tree	1
looked	1
down	1
at	1
them	1
and	1
spoke	1
in	1
a	1
tired	1
voice.	1
"In	1
the	1
summer,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"when	1
the	1
sun	1
is	1
hot,	1
men	1
come	1
and	1
sit	1
in	1
the	1
cool	1
of	1
my	1
shade	1
and	1
refresh	1
themselves	1
with	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
my	1
branches.	1
But	1
when	1
evening	1
falls,	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
rested,	1
they	1
break	1
my	1
twigs	1
and	1
scatter	1
my	1
leaves,	1
and	1
stone	1
my	1
boughs	1
for	1
more	1
fruit.	1
Men	1
are	1
an	1
ungrateful	1
race.	1
Let	1
the	1
Tiger	1
eat	1
the	1
Brahmin."	1
The	1
Tiger	1
sprang	1
to	1
eat	1
the	1
Brahmin,	1
but	1
the	1
Brahmin	1
said,--	1
"Wait,	1
wait;	1
we	1
have	1
asked	1
only	1
one.	1
We	1
have	1
still	1
four	1
to	1
ask."	1
Presently	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
place	1
where	1
an	1
old	1
Bullock	1
was	1
lying	1
by	1
the	1
road.	1
The	1
Brahmin	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
said,--	1
"Brother	1
Bullock,	1
oh,	1
Brother	1
Bullock,	1
does	1
it	1
seem	1
to	1
you	1
a	1
fair	1
thing	1
that	1
this	1
Tiger	1
should	1
eat	1
me	1
up,	1
after	1
I	1
have	1
just	1
freed	1
him	1
from	1
a	1
cage?"	1
The	1
Bullock	1
looked	1
up,	1
and	1
answered	1
in	1
a	1
deep,	1
grumbling	1
voice,--	1
"When	1
I	1
was	1
young	1
and	1
strong	1
my	1
master	1
used	1
me	1
hard,	1
and	1
I	1
served	1
him	1
well.	1
I	1
carried	1
heavy	1
loads	1
and	1
carried	1
them	1
far.	1
Now	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
old	1
and	1
weak	1
and	1
cannot	1
work,	1
he	1
leaves	1
me	1
without	1
food	1
or	1
water,	1
to	1
die	1
by	1
the	1
wayside.	1
Men	1
are	1
a	1
thankless	1
lot.	1
Let	1
the	1
Tiger	1
eat	1
the	1
Brahmin."	1
The	1
Tiger	1
sprang,	1
but	1
the	1
Brahmin	1
spoke	1
very	1
quickly,--	1
"Oh,	1
but	1
this	1
is	1
only	1
the	1
second,	1
Brother	1
Tiger;	1
you	1
promised	1
to	1
ask	1
five."	1
The	1
Tiger	1
grumbled	1
a	1
good	1
deal,	1
but	1
at	1
last	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
again	1
with	1
the	1
Brahmin.	1
And	1
after	1
a	1
time	1
they	1
saw	1
an	1
Eagle,	1
high	1
overhead.	1
The	1
Brahmin	1
called	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
imploringly,--	1
"Oh,	1
Brother	1
Eagle,	1
Brother	1
Eagle!	1
Tell	1
us	1
if	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
you	1
fair	1
that	1
this	1
Tiger	1
should	1
eat	1
me	1
up,	1
when	1
I	1
have	1
just	1
saved	1
him	1
from	1
a	1
frightful	1
cage?"	1
The	1
Eagle	1
soared	1
slowly	1
overhead	1
a	1
moment,	1
then	1
he	1
came	1
lower,	1
and	1
spoke	1
in	1
a	1
thin,	1
clear	1
voice.	1
"I	1
live	1
high	1
in	1
the	1
air,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"and	1
I	1
do	1
no	1
man	1
any	1
harm.	1
Yet	1
as	1
often	1
as	1
they	1
find	1
my	1
eyrie,	1
men	1
stone	1
my	1
young	1
and	1
rob	1
my	1
nest	1
and	1
shoot	1
at	1
me	1
with	1
arrows.	1
Men	1
are	1
a	1
cruel	1
breed.	1
Let	1
the	1
Tiger	1
eat	1
the	1
Brahmin!"	1
The	1
Tiger	1
sprang	1
upon	1
the	1
Brahmin,	1
to	1
eat	1
him	1
up;	1
and	1
this	1
time	1
the	1
Brahmin	1
had	1
very	1
hard	1
work	1
to	1
persuade	1
him	1
to	1
wait.	1
At	1
last	1
he	1
did	1
persuade	1
him,	1
however,	1
and	1
they	1
walked	1
on	1
together.	1
And	1
in	1
a	1
little	1
while	1
they	1
saw	1
an	1
old	1
Alligator,	1
lying	1
half	1
buried	1
in	1
mud	1
and	1
slime,	1
at	1
the	1
river's	1
edge.	1
"Brother	1
Alligator,	1
oh,	1
Brother	1
Alligator!"	1
said	1
the	1
Brahmin,	1
"does	1
it	1
seem	1
at	1
all	1
right	1
or	1
fair	1
to	1
you	1
that	1
this	1
Tiger	1
should	1
eat	1
me	1
up,	1
when	1
I	1
have	1
just	1
now	1
let	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
cage?"	1
The	1
old	1
Alligator	1
turned	1
in	1
the	1
mud,	1
and	1
grunted,	1
and	1
snorted;	1
then	1
he	1
said,--	1
"I	1
lie	1
here	1
in	1
the	1
mud	1
all	1
day,	1
as	1
harmless	1
as	1
a	1
pigeon;	1
I	1
hunt	1
no	1
man,	1
yet	1
every	1
time	1
a	1
man	1
sees	1
me,	1
he	1
throws	1
stones	1
at	1
me,	1
and	1
pokes	1
me	1
with	1
sharp	1
sticks,	1
and	1
jeers	1
at	1
me.	1
Men	1
are	1
a	1
worthless	1
lot.	1
Let	1
the	1
Tiger	1
eat	1
the	1
Brahmin!"	1
At	1
this	1
the	1
Tiger	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
eat	1
the	1
Brahmin	1
at	1
once.	1
The	1
poor	1
Brahmin	1
had	1
to	1
remind	1
him,	1
again	1
and	1
again,	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
asked	1
only	1
four.	1
"Wait	1
till	1
we've	1
asked	1
one	1
more!	1
Wait	1
until	1
we	1
see	1
a	1
fifth!"	1
he	1
begged.	1
Finally,	1
the	1
Tiger	1
walked	1
on	1
with	1
him.	1
After	1
a	1
time,	1
they	1
met	1
the	1
little	1
Jackal,	1
coming	1
gaily	1
down	1
the	1
road	1
toward	1
them.	1
"Oh,	1
Brother	1
Jackal,	1
dear	1
Brother	1
Jackal,"	1
said	1
the	1
Brahmin,	1
"give	1
us	1
your	1
opinion!	1
Do	1
you	1
think	1
it	1
right	1
or	1
fair	1
that	1
this	1
Tiger	1
should	1
eat	1
me,	1
when	1
I	1
set	1
him	1
free	1
from	1
a	1
terrible	1
cage?"	1
"Beg	1
pardon?"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
Jackal.	1
"I	1
said,"	1
said	1
the	1
Brahmin,	1
raising	1
his	1
voice,	1
"do	1
you	1
think	1
it	1
is	1
fair	1
that	1
the	1
Tiger	1
should	1
eat	1
me,	1
when	1
I	1
set	1
him	1
free	1
from	1
his	1
cage?"	1
"Cage?"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
Jackal,	1
vacantly.	1
"Yes,	1
yes,	1
his	1
cage,"	1
said	1
the	1
Brahmin.	1
"We	1
want	1
your	1
opinion.	1
Do	1
you	1
think----"	1
"Oh,"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
Jackal,	1
"you	1
want	1
my	1
opinion?	1
Then	1
may	1
I	1
beg	1
you	1
to	1
speak	1
a	1
little	1
more	1
loudly,	1
and	1
make	1
the	1
matter	1
quite	1
clear?	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
little	1
slow	1
of	1
understanding.	1
Now	1
what	1
was	1
it?"	1
"Do	1
you	1
think,"	1
said	1
the	1
Brahmin,	1
"it	1
is	1
right	1
for	1
this	1
Tiger	1
to	1
eat	1
me,	1
when	1
I	1
set	1
him	1
free	1
from	1
his	1
cage?"	1
"What	1
cage?"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
Jackal.	1
"Why,	1
the	1
cage	1
he	1
was	1
in,"	1
said	1
the	1
Brahmin.	1
"You	1
see----"	1
"But	1
I	1
don't	1
altogether	1
understand,"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
Jackal.	1
"You	1
'set	1
him	1
free,'	1
you	1
say?"	1
"Yes,	1
yes,	1
yes!"	1
said	1
the	1
Brahmin.	1
"It	1
was	1
this	1
way:	1
I	1
was	1
walking	1
along,	1
and	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
Tiger----"	1
"Oh,	1
dear,	1
dear!"	1
interrupted	1
the	1
little	1
Jackal;	1
"I	1
never	1
can	1
see	1
through	1
it,	1
if	1
you	1
go	1
on	1
like	1
that,	1
with	1
a	1
long	1
story.	1
If	1
you	1
really	1
want	1
my	1
opinion	1
you	1
must	1
make	1
the	1
matter	1
clear.	1
What	1
sort	1
of	1
cage	1
was	1
it?"	1
"Why,	1
a	1
big,	1
ordinary	1
cage,	1
an	1
iron	1
cage,"	1
said	1
the	1
Brahmin.	1
"That	1
gives	1
me	1
no	1
idea	1
at	1
all,"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
Jackal.	1
"See	1
here,	1
my	1
friends,	1
if	1
we	1
are	1
to	1
get	1
on	1
with	1
this	1
matter	1
you'd	1
best	1
show	1
me	1
the	1
spot.	1
Then	1
I	1
can	1
understand	1
in	1
a	1
jiffy.	1
Show	1
me	1
the	1
cage."	1
So	1
the	1
Brahmin,	1
the	1
Tiger,	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
Jackal	1
walked	1
back	1
together	1
to	1
the	1
spot	1
where	1
the	1
cage	1
was.	1
"Now,	1
let	1
us	1
understand	1
the	1
situation,"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
Jackal.	1
"Friend	1
Brahmin,	1
where	1
were	1
you?"	1
"I	1
stood	1
just	1
here	1
by	1
the	1
roadside,"	1
said	1
the	1
Brahmin.	1
"Tiger,	1
and	1
where	1
were	1
you?"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
Jackal.	1
"Why,	1
in	1
the	1
cage,	1
of	1
course,"	1
roared	1
the	1
Tiger.	1
"Oh,	1
I	1
beg	1
your	1
pardon,	1
Father	1
Tiger,"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
Jackal,	1
"I	1
really	1
am	1
_so_	1
stupid;	1
I	1
cannot	1
_quite_	1
understand	1
what	1
happened.	1
If	1
you	1
will	1
have	1
a	1
little	1
patience,--_how_	1
were	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
cage?	1
What	1
position	1
were	1
you	1
in?"	1
"I	1
stood	1
here,"	1
said	1
the	1
Tiger,	1
leaping	1
into	1
the	1
cage,	1
"with	1
my	1
head	1
over	1
my	1
shoulder,	1
so."	1
"Oh,	1
thank	1
you,	1
thank	1
you,"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
Jackal,	1
"that	1
makes	1
it	1
_much_	1
clearer;	1
but	1
I	1
still	1
don't	1
_quite_	1
understand--forgive	1
my	1
slow	1
mind--why	1
did	1
you	1
not	1
come	1
out,	1
by	1
yourself?"	1
"Can't	1
you	1
see	1
that	1
the	1
door	1
shut	1
me	1
in?"	1
said	1
the	1
Tiger.	1
"Oh,	1
I	1
do	1
beg	1
your	1
pardon,"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
Jackal.	1
"I	1
know	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
slow;	1
I	1
can	1
never	1
understand	1
things	1
well	1
unless	1
I	1
see	1
just	1
how	1
they	1
were;	1
if	1
you	1
could	1
show	1
me	1
now	1
exactly	1
how	1
that	1
door	1
works	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
I	1
could	1
understand.	1
How	1
does	1
it	1
shut?"	1
"It	1
shuts	1
like	1
this,"	1
said	1
the	1
Brahmin,	1
pushing	1
it	1
to.	1
"Yes;	1
but	1
I	1
don't	1
see	1
any	1
lock,"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
Jackal,	1
"does	1
it	1
lock	1
on	1
the	1
outside?"	1
"It	1
locks	1
like	1
this,"	1
said	1
the	1
Brahmin.	1
And	1
he	1
shut	1
and	1
bolted	1
the	1
door!	1
"Oh,	1
does	1
it,	1
indeed?"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
Jackal.	1
"Does	1
it,	1
_indeed_!	1
Well,	1
Brother	1
Brahmin,	1
now	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
locked,	1
I	1
should	1
advise	1
you	1
to	1
let	1
it	1
stay	1
locked!	1
As	1
for	1
you,	1
my	1
friend,"	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
Tiger,	1
"I	1
think	1
you	1
will	1
wait	1
a	1
good	1
while	1
before	1
you'll	1
find	1
anyone	1
to	1
let	1
you	1
out	1
again!"	1
Then	1
he	1
made	1
a	1
very	1
low	1
bow	1
to	1
the	1
Brahmin.	1
"Good-bye,	1
Brother,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"Your	1
way	1
lies	1
that	1
way,	1
and	1
mine	1
lies	1
this;	1
good-bye!"	1
THE	1
LITTLE	1
JACKAL	1
AND	1
THE	1
CAMEL	1
All	1
these	1
stories	1
about	1
the	1
little	1
Jackal	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
told	1
you,	1
show	1
how	1
clever	1
the	1
little	1
Jackal	1
was.	1
But	1
you	1
know--if	1
you	1
don't,	1
you	1
will	1
when	1
you	1
are	1
grown	1
up--that	1
no	1
matter	1
how	1
clever	1
you	1
are,	1
sooner	1
or	1
later	1
you	1
surely	1
meet	1
some	1
one	1
who	1
is	1
more	1
clever.	1
It	1
is	1
always	1
so	1
in	1
life.	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
with	1
the	1
little	1
Jackal.	1
This	1
is	1
what	1
happened.	1
The	1
little	1
Jackal	1
was,	1
as	1
you	1
know,	1
exceedingly	1
fond	1
of	1
shell-fish,	1
especially	1
of	1
river	1
crabs.	1
Now	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
time	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
eaten	1
all	1
the	1
crabs	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
on	1
his	1
own	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
river.	1
He	1
knew	1
there	1
must	1
be	1
plenty	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side,	1
if	1
he	1
could	1
only	1
get	1
to	1
them,	1
but	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
swim.	1
One	1
day	1
he	1
thought	1
of	1
a	1
plan.	1
He	1
went	1
to	1
his	1
friend	1
the	1
Camel,	1
and	1
said,--	1
"Friend	1
Camel,	1
I	1
know	1
a	1
spot	1
where	1
the	1
sugar-cane	1
grows	1
thick;	1
I'll	1
show	1
you	1
the	1
way,	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
take	1
me	1
there."	1
"Indeed	1
I	1
will,"	1
said	1
the	1
Camel,	1
who	1
was	1
very	1
fond	1
of	1
sugar-cane.	1
"Where	1
is	1
it?"	1
"It	1
is	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
river,"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
Jackal;	1
"but	1
we	1
can	1
manage	1
it	1
nicely,	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
take	1
me	1
on	1
your	1
back	1
and	1
swim	1
over."	1
The	1
Camel	1
was	1
perfectly	1
willing,	1
so	1
the	1
little	1
Jackal	1
jumped	1
on	1
his	1
back,	1
and	1
the	1
Camel	1
swam	1
across	1
the	1
river,	1
carrying	1
him.	1
When	1
they	1
were	1
safely	1
over,	1
the	1
little	1
Jackal	1
jumped	1
down	1
and	1
showed	1
the	1
Camel	1
the	1
sugar-cane	1
field;	1
then	1
he	1
ran	1
swiftly	1
along	1
the	1
river	1
bank,	1
to	1
hunt	1
for	1
crabs;	1
the	1
Camel	1
began	1
to	1
eat	1
sugar-cane.	1
He	1
ate	1
happily,	1
and	1
noticed	1
nothing	1
around	1
him.	1
Now,	1
you	1
know,	1
a	1
Camel	1
is	1
very	1
big,	1
and	1
a	1
Jackal	1
is	1
very	1
little.	1
Consequently,	1
the	1
little	1
Jackal	1
had	1
eaten	1
his	1
fill	1
by	1
the	1
time	1
the	1
Camel	1
had	1
barely	1
taken	1
a	1
mouthful.	1
The	1
little	1
Jackal	1
had	1
no	1
mind	1
to	1
wait	1
for	1
his	1
slow	1
friend;	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
be	1
off	1
home	1
again,	1
about	1
his	1
business.	1
So	1
he	1
ran	1
round	1
and	1
round	1
the	1
sugar-cane	1
field,	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
ran	1
he	1
sang	1
and	1
shouted,	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
great	1
hullabaloo.	1
Of	1
course,	1
the	1
villagers	1
heard	1
him	1
at	1
once.	1
"There	1
is	1
a	1
Jackal	1
in	1
the	1
sugar-cane,"	1
they	1
said;	1
"he	1
will	1
dig	1
holes	1
and	1
destroy	1
the	1
roots;	1
we	1
must	1
go	1
down	1
and	1
drive	1
him	1
out."	1
So	1
they	1
came	1
down,	1
with	1
sticks	1
and	1
stones.	1
When	1
they	1
got	1
there,	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
Jackal	1
to	1
be	1
seen;	1
but	1
they	1
saw	1
the	1
great	1
Camel,	1
eating	1
away	1
at	1
the	1
juicy	1
sugar-cane.	1
They	1
ran	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
beat	1
him,	1
and	1
stoned	1
him,	1
and	1
drove	1
him	1
away	1
half	1
dead.	1
When	1
they	1
had	1
gone,	1
leaving	1
the	1
poor	1
Camel	1
half	1
killed,	1
the	1
little	1
Jackal	1
came	1
dancing	1
back	1
from	1
somewhere	1
or	1
other.	1
"I	1
think	1
it's	1
time	1
to	1
go	1
home,	1
now,"	1
he	1
said;	1
"don't	1
you?"	1
"Well,	1
you	1
_are_	1
a	1
pretty	1
friend!"	1
said	1
the	1
Camel.	1
"The	1
idea	1
of	1
your	1
making	1
such	1
a	1
noise,	1
with	1
your	1
shouting	1
and	1
singing!	1
You	1
brought	1
this	1
upon	1
me.	1
What	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
made	1
you	1
do	1
it?	1
Why	1
did	1
you	1
shout	1
and	1
sing?"	1
"Oh,	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
_why_"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
Jackal,--"I	1
always	1
sing	1
after	1
dinner!"	1
"So?"	1
said	1
the	1
Camel.	1
"Ah,	1
very	1
well,	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
home	1
now."	1
He	1
took	1
the	1
little	1
Jackal	1
kindly	1
on	1
his	1
back	1
and	1
started	1
into	1
the	1
water.	1
When	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
swim	1
he	1
swam	1
out	1
to	1
where	1
the	1
river	1
was	1
the	1
very	1
deepest.	1
There	1
he	1
stopped,	1
and	1
said,--	1
"Oh,	1
Jackal!"	1
"Yes,"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
Jackal.	1
"I	1
have	1
the	1
strangest	1
feeling,"	1
said	1
the	1
Camel,--"I	1
feel	1
as	1
if	1
I	1
must	1
roll	1
over."	1
"'Roll	1
over'!"	1
cried	1
the	1
Jackal.	1
"My	1
goodness,	1
don't	1
do	1
that!	1
If	1
you	1
do	1
that,	1
you'll	1
drown	1
me!	1
What	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
makes	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
do	1
such	1
a	1
crazy	1
thing?	1
Why	1
should	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
roll	1
over?"	1
"Oh,	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
_why_,"	1
said	1
the	1
Camel	1
slowly,	1
"but	1
I	1
always	1
roll	1
over	1
after	1
dinner!"	1
So	1
he	1
rolled	1
over.	1
And	1
the	1
little	1
Jackal	1
was	1
drowned,	1
for	1
his	1
sins,	1
but	1
the	1
Camel	1
came	1
safely	1
home.	1
THE	1
GULLS	1
OF	1
SALT	1
LAKE	1
The	1
story	1
I	1
am	1
going	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
is	1
about	1
something	1
that	1
really	1
happened,	1
many	1
years	1
ago.	1
A	1
brave	1
little	1
company	1
of	1
pioneers	1
from	1
the	1
Atlantic	1
coast	1
crossed	1
the	1
Mississippi	1
River	1
and	1
journeyed	1
across	1
the	1
plains	1
of	1
Central	1
North	1
America	1
in	1
big	1
covered	1
wagons	1
with	1
many	1
horses,	1
and	1
finally	1
succeeded	1
in	1
climbing	1
to	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
Rockies	1
and	1
down	1
again	1
into	1
a	1
valley	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
mountains.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
valley	1
of	1
brown,	1
bare,	1
desert	1
soil,	1
in	1
a	1
climate	1
where	1
almost	1
no	1
rain	1
falls;	1
but	1
the	1
snow	1
on	1
the	1
mountain-tops	1
sent	1
down	1
little	1
streams	1
of	1
pure	1
water,	1
the	1
winds	1
were	1
gentle,	1
and	1
lying	1
like	1
a	1
blue	1
jewel	1
at	1
the	1
foot	1
of	1
the	1
western	1
hills	1
was	1
a	1
marvellous	1
lake	1
of	1
salt	1
water,--an	1
inland	1
sea.	1
So	1
the	1
pioneers	1
settled	1
there	1
and	1
built	1
themselves	1
huts	1
and	1
cabins	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
winter.	1
It	1
had	1
taken	1
them	1
many	1
months	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
terrible	1
journey;	1
many	1
had	1
died	1
of	1
weariness	1
and	1
illness	1
on	1
the	1
way;	1
many	1
died	1
of	1
hardship	1
during	1
the	1
winter;	1
and	1
the	1
provisions	1
they	1
had	1
brought	1
in	1
their	1
wagons	1
were	1
so	1
nearly	1
gone	1
that,	1
by	1
spring,	1
they	1
were	1
living	1
partly	1
on	1
roots,	1
dug	1
from	1
the	1
ground.	1
All	1
their	1
lives	1
now	1
depended	1
on	1
the	1
crops	1
of	1
grain	1
and	1
vegetables	1
which	1
they	1
could	1
raise	1
in	1
the	1
valley.	1
They	1
made	1
the	1
barren	1
land	1
fertile	1
by	1
spreading	1
water	1
from	1
the	1
little	1
streams	1
over	1
it,--what	1
we	1
call	1
"irrigating";	1
and	1
they	1
planted	1
enough	1
corn	1
and	1
grain	1
and	1
vegetables	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
people.	1
Every	1
one	1
helped,	1
and	1
every	1
one	1
watched	1
for	1
the	1
sprouting,	1
with	1
hopes,	1
and	1
prayers,	1
and	1
careful	1
eyes.	1
In	1
good	1
time	1
the	1
seeds	1
sprouted,	1
and	1
the	1
dry,	1
brown	1
earth	1
was	1
covered	1
with	1
a	1
carpet	1
of	1
tender,	1
green,	1
growing	1
things.	1
No	1
farmer's	1
garden	1
could	1
have	1
looked	1
better	1
than	1
the	1
great	1
garden	1
of	1
the	1
desert	1
valley.	1
And	1
from	1
day	1
to	1
day	1
the	1
little	1
shoots	1
grew	1
and	1
flourished	1
till	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
well	1
above	1
the	1
ground.	1
Then	1
a	1
terrible	1
thing	1
happened.	1
One	1
day,	1
the	1
men	1
who	1
were	1
watering	1
the	1
crops	1
saw	1
a	1
great	1
number	1
of	1
crickets	1
swarming	1
over	1
the	1
ground	1
at	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
gardens	1
nearest	1
the	1
mountains.	1
They	1
were	1
hopping	1
from	1
the	1
barren	1
places	1
into	1
the	1
young,	1
green	1
crops,	1
and	1
as	1
they	1
settled	1
down	1
they	1
ate	1
the	1
tiny	1
shoots	1
and	1
leaves	1
to	1
the	1
ground.	1
More	1
came,	1
and	1
more,	1
and	1
ever	1
more,	1
and	1
as	1
they	1
came	1
they	1
spread	1
out	1
till	1
they	1
covered	1
a	1
big	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
grain	1
field.	1
And	1
still	1
more	1
and	1
more,	1
till	1
it	1
was	1
like	1
an	1
army	1
of	1
black,	1
hopping,	1
crawling	1
crickets,	1
streaming	1
down	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
mountain	1
to	1
kill	1
the	1
crops.	1
The	1
men	1
tried	1
to	1
kill	1
the	1
crickets	1
by	1
beating	1
them	1
down,	1
but	1
the	1
numbers	1
were	1
so	1
great	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
like	1
beating	1
at	1
the	1
sea.	1
Then	1
they	1
ran	1
and	1
told	1
the	1
terrible	1
news,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
village	1
came	1
to	1
help.	1
They	1
started	1
fires;	1
they	1
dug	1
trenches	1
and	1
filled	1
them	1
with	1
water;	1
they	1
ran	1
wildly	1
about	1
in	1
the	1
fields,	1
killing	1
what	1
they	1
could.	1
But	1
while	1
they	1
fought	1
in	1
one	1
place	1
new	1
armies	1
of	1
crickets	1
marched	1
down	1
the	1
mountain-sides	1
and	1
attacked	1
the	1
fields	1
in	1
other	1
places.	1
And	1
at	1
last	1
the	1
people	1
fell	1
on	1
their	1
knees	1
and	1
wept	1
and	1
cried	1
in	1
despair,	1
for	1
they	1
saw	1
starvation	1
and	1
death	1
in	1
the	1
fields.	1
A	1
few	1
knelt	1
to	1
pray.	1
Others	1
gathered	1
round	1
and	1
joined	1
them,	1
weeping.	1
More	1
left	1
their	1
useless	1
struggles	1
and	1
knelt	1
beside	1
their	1
neighbours.	1
At	1
last	1
nearly	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
kneeling	1
on	1
the	1
desolate	1
fields	1
praying	1
for	1
deliverance	1
from	1
the	1
plague	1
of	1
crickets.	1
Suddenly,	1
from	1
far	1
off	1
in	1
the	1
air	1
toward	1
the	1
great	1
salt	1
lake,	1
there	1
was	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
flapping	1
wings.	1
It	1
grew	1
louder.	1
Some	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
looked	1
up,	1
startled.	1
They	1
saw,	1
like	1
a	1
white	1
cloud	1
rising	1
from	1
the	1
lake,	1
a	1
flock	1
of	1
sea	1
gulls	1
flying	1
toward	1
them.	1
Snow-white	1
in	1
the	1
sun,	1
with	1
great	1
wings	1
beating	1
and	1
soaring,	1
in	1
hundreds	1
and	1
hundreds,	1
they	1
rose	1
and	1
circled	1
and	1
came	1
on.	1
"The	1
gulls!	1
the	1
gulls!"	1
was	1
the	1
cry.	1
"What	1
does	1
it	1
mean?"	1
The	1
gulls	1
flew	1
overhead,	1
with	1
a	1
shrill	1
chorus	1
of	1
whimpering	1
cries,	1
and	1
then,	1
in	1
a	1
marvellous	1
white	1
cloud	1
of	1
outspread	1
wings	1
and	1
hovering	1
breasts,	1
they	1
settled	1
down	1
over	1
the	1
cultivated	1
ground.	1
"Oh!	1
woe!	1
woe!"	1
cried	1
the	1
people.	1
"The	1
gulls	1
are	1
eating	1
what	1
the	1
crickets	1
have	1
left!	1
they	1
will	1
strip	1
root	1
and	1
branch!"	1
But	1
all	1
at	1
once,	1
someone	1
called	1
out,--	1
"No,	1
no!	1
See!	1
they	1
are	1
eating	1
the	1
crickets!	1
They	1
are	1
eating	1
only	1
the	1
crickets!"	1
It	1
was	1
true.	1
The	1
gulls	1
devoured	1
the	1
crickets	1
in	1
dozens,	1
in	1
hundreds,	1
in	1
swarms.	1
They	1
ate	1
until	1
they	1
were	1
gorged,	1
and	1
then	1
they	1
flew	1
heavily	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
lake,	1
only	1
to	1
come	1
again	1
with	1
new	1
appetite.	1
And	1
when	1
at	1
last	1
they	1
finished,	1
they	1
had	1
stripped	1
the	1
fields	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
of	1
crickets;	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
saved.	1
To	1
this	1
day,	1
in	1
the	1
beautiful	1
city	1
of	1
Salt	1
Lake,	1
which	1
grew	1
out	1
of	1
that	1
pioneer	1
village,	1
the	1
little	1
children	1
are	1
taught	1
to	1
love	1
the	1
sea	1
gulls.	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
learn	1
drawing	1
and	1
weaving	1
in	1
the	1
schools,	1
their	1
first	1
design	1
is	1
often	1
a	1
picture	1
of	1
a	1
cricket	1
and	1
a	1
gull.	1
THE	1
NIGHTINGALE	1
A	1
long,	1
long	1
time	1
ago,	1
as	1
long	1
ago	1
as	1
when	1
there	1
were	1
fairies,	1
there	1
lived	1
an	1
emperor	1
in	1
China,	1
who	1
had	1
a	1
most	1
beautiful	1
palace,	1
all	1
made	1
of	1
crystal.	1
Outside	1
the	1
palace	1
was	1
the	1
loveliest	1
garden	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
world,	1
and	1
farther	1
away	1
was	1
a	1
forest	1
where	1
the	1
trees	1
were	1
taller	1
than	1
any	1
other	1
trees	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
farther	1
away,	1
still,	1
was	1
a	1
deep	1
wood.	1
And	1
in	1
this	1
wood	1
lived	1
a	1
little	1
Nightingale.	1
The	1
Nightingale	1
sang	1
so	1
beautifully	1
that	1
everybody	1
who	1
heard	1
her	1
remembered	1
her	1
song	1
better	1
than	1
anything	1
else	1
that	1
he	1
heard	1
or	1
saw.	1
People	1
came	1
from	1
all	1
over	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
crystal	1
palace	1
and	1
the	1
wonderful	1
garden	1
and	1
the	1
great	1
forest;	1
but	1
when	1
they	1
went	1
home	1
and	1
wrote	1
books	1
about	1
these	1
things	1
they	1
always	1
wrote,	1
"But	1
the	1
Nightingale	1
is	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
all."	1
At	1
last	1
it	1
happened	1
that	1
the	1
Emperor	1
came	1
upon	1
a	1
book	1
which	1
said	1
this,	1
and	1
he	1
at	1
once	1
sent	1
for	1
his	1
Chamberlain.	1
"Who	1
is	1
this	1
Nightingale?"	1
said	1
the	1
Emperor.	1
"Why	1
have	1
I	1
never	1
heard	1
him	1
sing?"	1
The	1
Chamberlain,	1
who	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
important	1
person,	1
said,	1
"There	1
cannot	1
be	1
any	1
such	1
person;	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
heard	1
his	1
name."	1
"The	1
book	1
says	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
Nightingale,"	1
said	1
the	1
Emperor.	1
"I	1
command	1
that	1
the	1
Nightingale	1
be	1
brought	1
here	1
to	1
sing	1
for	1
me	1
this	1
evening."	1
The	1
Chamberlain	1
went	1
out	1
and	1
asked	1
all	1
the	1
great	1
lords	1
and	1
ladies	1
and	1
pages	1
where	1
the	1
Nightingale	1
could	1
be	1
found,	1
but	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
had	1
ever	1
heard	1
of	1
him.	1
So	1
the	1
Chamberlain	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor	1
and	1
said,	1
"There	1
is	1
no	1
such	1
person."	1
"The	1
book	1
says	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
Nightingale,"	1
said	1
the	1
Emperor;	1
"if	1
the	1
Nightingale	1
is	1
not	1
here	1
to	1
sing	1
for	1
me	1
this	1
evening	1
I	1
will	1
have	1
the	1
court	1
trampled	1
upon,	1
immediately	1
after	1
supper."	1
The	1
Chamberlain	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
be	1
trampled	1
upon,	1
so	1
he	1
ran	1
out	1
and	1
asked	1
everybody	1
in	1
the	1
palace	1
about	1
the	1
Nightingale.	1
At	1
last,	1
a	1
little	1
girl	1
who	1
worked	1
in	1
the	1
kitchen	1
to	1
help	1
the	1
cook,	1
said,	1
"Oh,	1
yes,	1
I	1
know	1
the	1
Nightingale	1
very	1
well.	1
Every	1
night,	1
when	1
I	1
go	1
to	1
carry	1
scraps	1
from	1
the	1
kitchen	1
to	1
my	1
mother,	1
who	1
lives	1
in	1
the	1
wood	1
beyond	1
the	1
forest,	1
I	1
hear	1
the	1
Nightingale	1
sing."	1
The	1
Chamberlain	1
asked	1
the	1
maid	1
to	1
take	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
Nightingale's	1
home,	1
and	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
lords	1
and	1
ladies	1
followed	1
after.	1
When	1
they	1
had	1
gone	1
a	1
little	1
way,	1
they	1
heard	1
a	1
cow	1
moo.	1
"Ah!"	1
said	1
the	1
lords	1
and	1
ladies,	1
"that	1
must	1
be	1
the	1
Nightingale;	1
what	1
a	1
large	1
voice	1
for	1
so	1
small	1
a	1
creature!"	1
"Oh,	1
no,"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
girl,	1
"that	1
is	1
just	1
a	1
cow,	1
mooing."	1
A	1
little	1
farther	1
on	1
they	1
heard	1
some	1
bullfrogs,	1
in	1
a	1
swamp.	1
"Surely	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
Nightingale,"	1
said	1
the	1
courtiers;	1
"it	1
really	1
sounds	1
like	1
church-bells!"	1
"Oh,	1
no,"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
girl,	1
"those	1
are	1
bullfrogs,	1
croaking."	1
At	1
last	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
wood	1
where	1
the	1
Nightingale	1
was.	1
"Hush!"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
girl,	1
"she	1
is	1
going	1
to	1
sing."	1
And,	1
sure	1
enough,	1
the	1
little	1
Nightingale	1
began	1
to	1
sing.	1
She	1
sang	1
so	1
beautifully	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
never	1
in	1
all	1
your	1
life	1
heard	1
anything	1
like	1
it.	1
"Dear,	1
dear,"	1
said	1
the	1
courtiers,	1
"that	1
is	1
very	1
pleasant;	1
does	1
that	1
little	1
grey	1
bird	1
really	1
make	1
all	1
that	1
noise?	1
She	1
is	1
so	1
pale	1
that	1
I	1
think	1
she	1
has	1
lost	1
her	1
colour	1
for	1
fear	1
of	1
us."	1
The	1
Chamberlain	1
asked	1
the	1
little	1
Nightingale	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
sing	1
for	1
the	1
Emperor.	1
The	1
little	1
Nightingale	1
said	1
she	1
could	1
sing	1
better	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
greenwood,	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
so	1
sweet	1
and	1
kind	1
that	1
she	1
came	1
with	1
them.	1
That	1
evening	1
the	1
palace	1
was	1
all	1
trimmed	1
with	1
the	1
most	1
beautiful	1
flowers	1
you	1
can	1
imagine,	1
and	1
rows	1
and	1
rows	1
of	1
little	1
silver	1
bells,	1
that	1
tinkled	1
when	1
the	1
wind	1
blew	1
in,	1
and	1
hundreds	1
and	1
hundreds	1
and	1
hundreds	1
of	1
wax	1
candles,	1
that	1
shone	1
like	1
tiny	1
stars.	1
In	1
the	1
great	1
hall	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
gold	1
perch	1
for	1
the	1
Nightingale,	1
beside	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
throne.	1
When	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
there,	1
the	1
Emperor	1
asked	1
the	1
Nightingale	1
to	1
sing.	1
Then	1
the	1
little	1
grey	1
Nightingale	1
filled	1
her	1
throat	1
full,	1
and	1
sang.	1
And,	1
my	1
dears,	1
she	1
sang	1
so	1
beautifully	1
that	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
eyes	1
filled	1
up	1
with	1
tears!	1
And,	1
you	1
know,	1
emperors	1
do	1
not	1
cry	1
at	1
all	1
easily.	1
So	1
he	1
asked	1
her	1
to	1
sing	1
again,	1
and	1
this	1
time	1
she	1
sang	1
so	1
marvellously	1
that	1
the	1
tears	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
ran	1
down	1
his	1
cheeks.	1
That	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
success.	1
They	1
asked	1
the	1
little	1
Nightingale	1
to	1
sing,	1
over	1
and	1
over	1
again,	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
listened	1
enough	1
the	1
Emperor	1
said	1
that	1
she	1
should	1
be	1
made	1
"Singer	1
in	1
Chief	1
to	1
the	1
Court."	1
She	1
was	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
golden	1
perch	1
near	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
bed,	1
and	1
a	1
little	1
golden	1
cage,	1
and	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
allowed	1
to	1
go	1
out	1
twice	1
every	1
day.	1
But	1
there	1
were	1
twelve	1
servants	1
appointed	1
to	1
wait	1
on	1
her,	1
and	1
those	1
twelve	1
servants	1
went	1
with	1
her	1
every	1
time	1
she	1
went	1
out,	1
and	1
each	1
of	1
the	1
twelve	1
had	1
hold	1
of	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
a	1
silken	1
string	1
which	1
was	1
tied	1
to	1
the	1
little	1
Nightingale's	1
leg!	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
very	1
much	1
fun	1
to	1
go	1
out	1
that	1
way!	1
For	1
a	1
long,	1
long	1
time	1
the	1
Nightingale	1
sang	1
every	1
evening	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor	1
and	1
his	1
court,	1
and	1
they	1
liked	1
her	1
so	1
much	1
that	1
the	1
ladies	1
all	1
tried	1
to	1
sing	1
like	1
her;	1
they	1
used	1
to	1
put	1
water	1
in	1
their	1
mouths	1
and	1
then	1
make	1
little	1
sounds	1
like	1
this:	1
_glu-glu-glug_.	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
courtiers	1
met	1
each	1
other	1
in	1
the	1
halls,	1
one	1
would	1
say	1
"Night,"	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
would	1
say	1
"ingale,"	1
and	1
that	1
was	1
supposed	1
to	1
be	1
conversation.	1
At	1
last,	1
one	1
day,	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
little	1
package	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
on	1
the	1
outside	1
of	1
which	1
was	1
written,	1
"The	1
Nightingale."	1
Inside	1
was	1
an	1
artificial	1
bird,	1
something	1
like	1
a	1
Nightingale,	1
only	1
it	1
was	1
made	1
of	1
gold,	1
and	1
silver,	1
and	1
rubies,	1
and	1
emeralds,	1
and	1
diamonds.	1
When	1
it	1
was	1
wound	1
up	1
it	1
played	1
a	1
waltz	1
tune,	1
and	1
as	1
it	1
played	1
it	1
moved	1
its	1
little	1
tail	1
up	1
and	1
down.	1
Everybody	1
in	1
the	1
court	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
delight	1
at	1
the	1
music	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
nightingale.	1
They	1
made	1
it	1
sing	1
that	1
same	1
tune	1
thirty-three	1
times,	1
and	1
still	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
had	1
enough.	1
They	1
would	1
have	1
made	1
it	1
sing	1
the	1
tune	1
thirty-four	1
times,	1
but	1
the	1
Emperor	1
said,	1
"I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
real	1
Nightingale	1
sing,	1
now."	1
But	1
when	1
they	1
looked	1
about	1
for	1
the	1
real	1
little	1
Nightingale,	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
find	1
her	1
anywhere!	1
She	1
had	1
taken	1
the	1
chance,	1
while	1
everybody	1
was	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
waltz	1
tunes,	1
to	1
fly	1
away	1
through	1
the	1
window	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
greenwood.	1
"What	1
a	1
very	1
ungrateful	1
bird!"	1
said	1
the	1
lords	1
and	1
ladies.	1
"But	1
it	1
does	1
not	1
matter;	1
the	1
new	1
nightingale	1
is	1
just	1
as	1
good."	1
So	1
the	1
artificial	1
nightingale	1
was	1
given	1
the	1
real	1
Nightingale's	1
little	1
gold	1
perch,	1
and	1
every	1
night	1
the	1
Emperor	1
wound	1
her	1
up,	1
and	1
she	1
sang	1
waltz	1
tunes	1
to	1
him.	1
The	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
court	1
liked	1
her	1
even	1
better	1
than	1
the	1
old	1
Nightingale,	1
because	1
they	1
could	1
all	1
whistle	1
her	1
tunes,--which	1
you	1
can't	1
do	1
with	1
real	1
nightingales.	1
About	1
a	1
year	1
after	1
the	1
artificial	1
nightingale	1
came,	1
the	1
Emperor	1
was	1
listening	1
to	1
her	1
waltz	1
tune,	1
when	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
_snap_	1
and	1
_whir-r-r_	1
inside	1
the	1
bird,	1
and	1
the	1
music	1
stopped.	1
The	1
Emperor	1
ran	1
to	1
his	1
doctor,	1
but	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
do	1
anything.	1
Then	1
he	1
ran	1
to	1
his	1
clock-maker,	1
but	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
do	1
much.	1
Nobody	1
could	1
do	1
much.	1
The	1
best	1
they	1
could	1
do	1
was	1
to	1
patch	1
the	1
gold	1
nightingale	1
up	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
could	1
sing	1
once	1
a	1
year;	1
even	1
that	1
was	1
almost	1
too	1
much,	1
and	1
the	1
tune	1
was	1
very	1
shaky.	1
Still,	1
the	1
Emperor	1
kept	1
the	1
gold	1
nightingale	1
on	1
the	1
perch	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
room.	1
A	1
long	1
time	1
went	1
by,	1
and	1
then,	1
at	1
last,	1
the	1
Emperor	1
grew	1
very	1
ill,	1
and	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
die.	1
When	1
it	1
was	1
sure	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
live	1
much	1
longer,	1
the	1
people	1
chose	1
a	1
new	1
emperor	1
and	1
waited	1
for	1
the	1
old	1
one	1
to	1
die.	1
The	1
poor	1
Emperor	1
lay,	1
quite	1
cold	1
and	1
pale,	1
in	1
his	1
great	1
big	1
bed,	1
with	1
velvet	1
curtains	1
and	1
tall	1
candlesticks	1
all	1
about.	1
He	1
was	1
quite	1
alone,	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
courtiers	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
congratulate	1
the	1
new	1
emperor,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
servants	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
talk	1
it	1
over.	1
When	1
the	1
Emperor	1
woke	1
up,	1
he	1
felt	1
a	1
terrible	1
weight	1
on	1
his	1
chest.	1
He	1
opened	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
Death,	1
sitting	1
on	1
his	1
heart.	1
Death	1
had	1
put	1
on	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
gold	1
crown,	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
gold	1
sceptre	1
in	1
one	1
hand,	1
and	1
the	1
silken	1
banner	1
in	1
the	1
other;	1
and	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
Emperor	1
with	1
his	1
great	1
hollow	1
eyes.	1
The	1
room	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
shadows,	1
and	1
the	1
shadows	1
were	1
full	1
of	1
faces.	1
Everywhere	1
the	1
Emperor	1
looked,	1
there	1
were	1
faces.	1
Some	1
were	1
very,	1
very	1
ugly,	1
and	1
some	1
were	1
sweet	1
and	1
lovely;	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
the	1
things	1
the	1
Emperor	1
had	1
done	1
in	1
his	1
life,	1
good	1
and	1
bad.	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
them	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
whisper.	1
They	1
whispered,	1
"_Do	1
you	1
remember	1
this?_"	1
"_Do	1
you	1
remember	1
that?_"	1
The	1
Emperor	1
remembered	1
so	1
much	1
that	1
he	1
cried	1
out	1
loud,	1
"Oh,	1
bring	1
the	1
great	1
drum!	1
Make	1
music,	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
not	1
hear	1
these	1
dreadful	1
whispers!"	1
But	1
there	1
was	1
nobody	1
there	1
to	1
bring	1
the	1
drum.	1
Then	1
the	1
Emperor	1
cried,	1
"You	1
little	1
gold	1
nightingale,	1
can	1
you	1
not	1
sing	1
something	1
for	1
me?	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
you	1
gifts	1
of	1
gold	1
and	1
jewels,	1
and	1
kept	1
you	1
always	1
by	1
my	1
side;	1
will	1
you	1
not	1
help	1
me	1
now?"	1
But	1
there	1
was	1
nobody	1
to	1
wind	1
the	1
little	1
gold	1
nightingale	1
up,	1
and	1
of	1
course	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
sing.	1
The	1
Emperor's	1
heart	1
grew	1
colder	1
and	1
colder	1
where	1
Death	1
crouched	1
upon	1
it,	1
and	1
the	1
dreadful	1
whispers	1
grew	1
louder	1
and	1
louder,	1
and	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
life	1
was	1
almost	1
gone.	1
Suddenly,	1
through	1
the	1
open	1
window,	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
most	1
lovely	1
song.	1
It	1
was	1
so	1
sweet	1
and	1
so	1
loud	1
that	1
the	1
whispers	1
died	1
quite	1
away.	1
Presently	1
the	1
Emperor	1
felt	1
his	1
heart	1
grow	1
warm,	1
then	1
he	1
felt	1
the	1
blood	1
flow	1
through	1
his	1
limbs	1
again;	1
he	1
listened	1
to	1
the	1
song	1
until	1
the	1
tears	1
ran	1
down	1
his	1
cheeks;	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
little	1
real	1
Nightingale	1
who	1
had	1
flown	1
away	1
from	1
him	1
when	1
the	1
gold	1
nightingale	1
came.	1
Death	1
was	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
song,	1
too;	1
and	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
done	1
and	1
the	1
Emperor	1
begged	1
for	1
more,	1
Death,	1
too,	1
said,	1
"Please	1
sing	1
again,	1
little	1
Nightingale!"	1
"Will	1
you	1
give	1
me	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
gold	1
crown	1
for	1
a	1
song?"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
Nightingale.	1
"Yes,"	1
said	1
Death;	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
Nightingale	1
bought	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
crown	1
for	1
a	1
song.	1
"Oh,	1
sing	1
again,	1
little	1
Nightingale,"	1
begged	1
Death.	1
"Will	1
you	1
give	1
me	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
sceptre	1
for	1
another	1
song?"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
grey	1
Nightingale.	1
"Yes,"	1
said	1
Death;	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
Nightingale	1
bought	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
sceptre	1
for	1
another	1
song.	1
Once	1
more	1
Death	1
begged	1
for	1
a	1
song,	1
and	1
this	1
time	1
the	1
little	1
Nightingale	1
obtained	1
the	1
banner	1
for	1
her	1
singing.	1
Then	1
she	1
sang	1
one	1
more	1
song,	1
so	1
sweet	1
and	1
so	1
sad	1
that	1
it	1
made	1
Death	1
think	1
of	1
his	1
garden	1
in	1
the	1
churchyard,	1
where	1
he	1
always	1
liked	1
best	1
to	1
be.	1
And	1
he	1
rose	1
from	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
heart	1
and	1
floated	1
away	1
through	1
the	1
window.	1
When	1
Death	1
was	1
gone,	1
the	1
Emperor	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
little	1
Nightingale,	1
"Oh,	1
dear	1
little	1
Nightingale,	1
you	1
have	1
saved	1
me	1
from	1
Death!	1
Do	1
not	1
leave	1
me	1
again.	1
Stay	1
with	1
me	1
on	1
this	1
little	1
gold	1
perch,	1
and	1
sing	1
to	1
me	1
always!"	1
"No,	1
dear	1
Emperor,"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
Nightingale,	1
"I	1
sing	1
best	1
when	1
I	1
am	1
free;	1
I	1
cannot	1
live	1
in	1
a	1
palace.	1
But	1
every	1
night	1
when	1
you	1
are	1
quite	1
alone,	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
and	1
sit	1
in	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
sing	1
to	1
you,	1
and	1
tell	1
you	1
everything	1
that	1
goes	1
on	1
in	1
your	1
kingdom:	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
you	1
where	1
the	1
poor	1
people	1
are	1
who	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
helped,	1
and	1
where	1
the	1
wicked	1
people	1
are	1
who	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
punished.	1
Only,	1
dear	1
Emperor,	1
be	1
sure	1
that	1
you	1
never	1
let	1
anybody	1
know	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
a	1
little	1
bird	1
who	1
tells	1
you	1
everything."	1
After	1
the	1
little	1
Nightingale	1
had	1
flown	1
away,	1
the	1
Emperor	1
felt	1
so	1
well	1
and	1
strong	1
that	1
he	1
dressed	1
himself	1
in	1
his	1
royal	1
robes	1
and	1
took	1
his	1
gold	1
sceptre	1
in	1
his	1
hand.	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
courtiers	1
came	1
in	1
to	1
see	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
dead,	1
there	1
stood	1
the	1
Emperor	1
with	1
his	1
sword	1
in	1
one	1
hand	1
and	1
his	1
sceptre	1
in	1
the	1
other,	1
and	1
said,	1
"Good-morning!"	1
MARGERY'S	1
GARDEN	1
There	1
was	1
once	1
a	1
little	1
girl	1
named	1
Margery,	1
who	1
had	1
always	1
lived	1
in	1
the	1
city.	1
The	1
flat	1
where	1
her	1
mother	1
and	1
father	1
lived	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
a	1
big	1
building,	1
and	1
you	1
couldn't	1
see	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
from	1
the	1
windows,	1
except	1
chimney-pots	1
on	1
other	1
people's	1
roofs.	1
Margery	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
much	1
about	1
trees	1
and	1
flowers,	1
but	1
she	1
loved	1
them	1
dearly;	1
whenever	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
fine	1
Sunday	1
she	1
used	1
to	1
go	1
with	1
her	1
mother	1
and	1
father	1
to	1
the	1
park	1
and	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
lovely	1
flower-beds.	1
They	1
seemed	1
always	1
to	1
be	1
finished,	1
though,	1
and	1
Margery	1
was	1
always	1
wishing	1
she	1
could	1
see	1
them	1
grow.	1
One	1
spring,	1
when	1
Margery	1
was	1
nine,	1
her	1
father	1
obtained	1
a	1
new	1
situation	1
and	1
they	1
removed	1
to	1
a	1
little	1
house	1
with	1
a	1
nice	1
big	1
piece	1
of	1
ground	1
a	1
short	1
distance	1
outside	1
the	1
town	1
where	1
his	1
new	1
position	1
was.	1
Margery	1
was	1
delighted.	1
And	1
the	1
very	1
first	1
thing	1
she	1
said,	1
when	1
her	1
father	1
told	1
her	1
about	1
it,	1
was,	1
"Oh,	1
may	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
garden?	1
_May_	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
garden?"	1
Margery's	1
mother	1
was	1
almost	1
as	1
eager	1
for	1
a	1
garden	1
as	1
she	1
was,	1
and	1
Margery's	1
father	1
said	1
he	1
expected	1
to	1
live	1
on	1
their	1
vegetables	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
his	1
life!	1
So	1
it	1
was	1
soon	1
agreed	1
that	1
the	1
garden	1
should	1
be	1
the	1
first	1
thing	1
attended	1
to.	1
Behind	1
the	1
cottage	1
were	1
apple	1
trees,	1
a	1
plum	1
tree,	1
and	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
pear	1
trees;	1
then	1
came	1
a	1
stretch	1
of	1
rough	1
grass,	1
and	1
then	1
a	1
stone	1
wall,	1
with	1
a	1
gate	1
leading	1
into	1
the	1
fields.	1
It	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
grass	1
plot	1
that	1
the	1
garden	1
was	1
to	1
be.	1
A	1
big	1
piece	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
used	1
for	1
wheat	1
and	1
peas	1
and	1
beans,	1
and	1
a	1
little	1
piece	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
given	1
to	1
Margery.	1
"What	1
shall	1
we	1
have	1
in	1
it?"	1
asked	1
her	1
mother.	1
"Flowers,"	1
said	1
Margery,	1
with	1
shining	1
eyes,--"blue,	1
and	1
white,	1
and	1
yellow,	1
and	1
pink,--every	1
kind	1
of	1
flower!"	1
"Surely,	1
flowers,"	1
said	1
her	1
mother,	1
"and	1
shall	1
we	1
not	1
have	1
a	1
little	1
salad	1
garden	1
in	1
the	1
middle?"	1
"What	1
is	1
a	1
salad	1
garden?"	1
Margery	1
asked.	1
"It	1
is	1
a	1
garden	1
where	1
you	1
have	1
all	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
make	1
nice	1
salad,"	1
said	1
her	1
mother,	1
laughing,	1
for	1
Margery	1
was	1
fond	1
of	1
salads;	1
"you	1
have	1
lettuce,	1
and	1
endive,	1
and	1
mustard	1
and	1
cress,	1
and	1
parsley,	1
and	1
radishes,	1
and	1
beetroot,	1
and	1
young	1
onions."	1
"Oh!	1
how	1
good	1
it	1
sounds!"	1
said	1
Margery.	1
"I	1
should	1
love	1
a	1
salad	1
garden."	1
That	1
very	1
evening,	1
Margery's	1
father	1
took	1
pencil	1
and	1
paper,	1
and	1
drew	1
out	1
a	1
plan	1
for	1
her	1
garden;	1
first,	1
they	1
talked	1
it	1
all	1
over,	1
then	1
he	1
drew	1
what	1
they	1
decided	1
on;	1
it	1
looked	1
like	1
the	1
diagram	1
on	1
the	1
next	1
page.	1
"The	1
outside	1
strip	1
is	1
for	1
flowers,"	1
said	1
Margery's	1
father,	1
"and	1
next	1
is	1
a	1
footpath,	1
all	1
the	1
way	1
round	1
the	1
beds;	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
let	1
you	1
get	1
at	1
the	1
flowers	1
to	1
weed	1
and	1
to	1
pick;	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
wider	1
path	1
through	1
the	1
middle,	1
and	1
the	1
rest	1
is	1
for	1
rows	1
of	1
salad	1
vegetables."	1
"Papa,	1
it	1
is	1
glorious!"	1
said	1
Margery.	1
Papa	1
laughed.	1
"I	1
hope	1
you	1
will	1
still	1
think	1
it	1
glorious	1
when	1
the	1
weeding	1
time	1
comes,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"for	1
you	1
know,	1
you	1
and	1
mother	1
have	1
promised	1
to	1
take	1
care	1
of	1
this	1
garden,	1
while	1
I	1
take	1
care	1
of	1
the	1
big	1
one."	1
"I	1
wouldn't	1
_not_	1
take	1
care	1
of	1
it	1
for	1
anything!"	1
said	1
Margery.	1
"I	1
want	1
to	1
feel	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
my	1
very	1
own."	1
[Illustration]	1
Her	1
father	1
kissed	1
her,	1
and	1
said	1
it	1
was	1
certainly	1
her	1
"very	1
own."	1
Two	1
evenings	1
after	1
that,	1
when	1
Margery	1
was	1
called	1
in	1
from	1
her	1
first	1
ramble	1
in	1
the	1
fields,	1
she	1
found	1
the	1
postman	1
at	1
the	1
door.	1
"Something	1
for	1
you,	1
Margery,"	1
said	1
her	1
mother,	1
with	1
the	1
look	1
she	1
had	1
when	1
something	1
nice	1
was	1
happening.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
box,	1
quite	1
a	1
big	1
box,	1
with	1
a	1
label	1
on	1
it	1
that	1
said:--	1
MISS	1
MARGERY	1
BROWN,	1
PRIMROSE	1
COTTAGE,	1
21	1
NARCISSUS	1
ROAD,	1
COLCHESTER.	1
From	1
Seeds	1
and	1
Plants	1
Company,	1
Reading.	1
Margery	1
could	1
hardly	1
wait	1
to	1
open	1
it.	1
It	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
little	1
packages,	1
all	1
with	1
printed	1
labels;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
packages,	1
of	1
course,	1
were	1
seeds.	1
It	1
made	1
Margery	1
dance,	1
just	1
to	1
read	1
the	1
names,--nasturtium,	1
giant	1
helianthus,	1
canariensis,	1
calendula,	1
Canterbury	1
bells:	1
more	1
names	1
than	1
I	1
can	1
tell	1
you;	1
and	1
other	1
packages,	1
bigger,	1
that	1
said,	1
"Sweet	1
Peas,"	1
"French	1
beans,"	1
"Carrots,"	1
"Wallflowers,"	1
and	1
such	1
things!	1
Margery	1
could	1
almost	1
smell	1
the	1
posies,	1
she	1
was	1
so	1
excited.	1
Only,	1
she	1
had	1
seen	1
so	1
little	1
of	1
flowers	1
that	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
all	1
the	1
names	1
meant.	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
that	1
a	1
helianthus	1
was	1
a	1
sunflower	1
until	1
her	1
mother	1
told	1
her	1
so,	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
the	1
dear,	1
blue,	1
bell-shaped	1
flowers	1
that	1
always	1
grow	1
in	1
old-fashioned	1
gardens,	1
and	1
are	1
called	1
Canterbury	1
bells.	1
She	1
thought	1
the	1
calendula	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
strange,	1
grand	1
flower,	1
by	1
its	1
name;	1
but	1
her	1
mother	1
told	1
her	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
gay,	1
sturdy,	1
everydayish	1
little	1
flower	1
called	1
a	1
marigold.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
for	1
a	1
little	1
city	1
girl	1
to	1
be	1
surprised	1
about,	1
and	1
it	1
did	1
seem	1
as	1
if	1
morning	1
was	1
a	1
long	1
way	1
off!	1
"Did	1
you	1
think	1
you	1
could	1
plant	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
morning?"	1
asked	1
her	1
mother.	1
"You	1
know,	1
dear,	1
the	1
ground	1
has	1
to	1
be	1
made	1
ready	1
first;	1
it	1
takes	1
a	1
little	1
time,--it	1
may	1
be	1
several	1
days	1
before	1
you	1
can	1
plant."	1
That	1
was	1
another	1
surprise.	1
Margery	1
had	1
thought	1
she	1
could	1
begin	1
to	1
sow	1
the	1
seed	1
right	1
off.	1
But	1
this	1
was	1
what	1
had	1
happened.	1
Early	1
the	1
next	1
morning,	1
a	1
man	1
came	1
driving	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
cottage	1
with	1
two	1
strong	1
white	1
horses;	1
in	1
his	1
wagon	1
was	1
a	1
plough.	1
I	1
suppose	1
you	1
have	1
seen	1
ploughs,	1
but	1
Margery	1
never	1
had,	1
and	1
she	1
watched	1
with	1
great	1
interest,	1
while	1
the	1
man	1
and	1
her	1
father	1
took	1
the	1
plough	1
from	1
the	1
cart	1
and	1
harnessed	1
the	1
horses	1
to	1
it.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
great,	1
three-cornered	1
piece	1
of	1
sharp	1
steel,	1
with	1
long	1
handles	1
coming	1
up	1
from	1
it,	1
so	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
could	1
hold	1
it	1
in	1
place.	1
It	1
looked	1
like	1
this:--	1
[Illustration]	1
"I	1
brought	1
a	1
two-horse	1
plough	1
because	1
it's	1
virgin	1
soil,"	1
the	1
man	1
said.	1
Margery	1
wondered	1
what	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
he	1
meant;	1
it	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
cultivated,	1
of	1
course,	1
but	1
what	1
had	1
that	1
do	1
with	1
the	1
kind	1
of	1
plough?	1
"What	1
does	1
he	1
mean,	1
father?"	1
she	1
whispered,	1
when	1
she	1
got	1
a	1
chance.	1
"He	1
means	1
that	1
this	1
land	1
has	1
not	1
been	1
ploughed	1
before;	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
hard	1
to	1
turn	1
the	1
soil,	1
and	1
one	1
horse	1
could	1
not	1
pull	1
the	1
plough,"	1
said	1
her	1
father.	1
It	1
took	1
the	1
man	1
two	1
hours	1
to	1
plough	1
the	1
little	1
strip	1
of	1
land.	1
He	1
drove	1
the	1
sharp	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
plough	1
into	1
the	1
soil,	1
and	1
held	1
it	1
firmly	1
so,	1
while	1
the	1
horses	1
drew	1
it	1
along	1
in	1
a	1
straight	1
line.	1
Margery	1
found	1
it	1
fascinating	1
to	1
watch	1
the	1
long	1
line	1
of	1
dark	1
earth	1
and	1
green	1
grass	1
come	1
rolling	1
up	1
and	1
turn	1
over,	1
as	1
the	1
knife	1
passed	1
it.	1
She	1
could	1
see	1
that	1
it	1
took	1
real	1
skill	1
and	1
strength	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
line	1
even,	1
and	1
to	1
avoid	1
the	1
stones.	1
Sometimes	1
the	1
plough	1
struck	1
a	1
hidden	1
stone,	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
man	1
was	1
jerked	1
almost	1
off	1
his	1
feet.	1
But	1
he	1
only	1
laughed,	1
and	1
said,	1
"Tough	1
piece	1
of	1
land;	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
lot	1
better	1
next	1
year."	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
ploughed,	1
the	1
man	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
his	1
cart	1
and	1
unloaded	1
another	1
farm	1
implement.	1
This	1
one	1
was	1
like	1
a	1
three-cornered	1
platform	1
of	1
wood,	1
with	1
a	1
long,	1
curved,	1
strong	1
rake	1
under	1
it.	1
It	1
was	1
called	1
a	1
harrow,	1
and	1
it	1
looked	1
like	1
the	1
diagram	1
on	1
the	1
next	1
page.	1
The	1
man	1
harnessed	1
the	1
horses	1
to	1
it,	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
stood	1
on	1
the	1
platform	1
and	1
drove	1
all	1
over	1
the	1
strip	1
of	1
land.	1
It	1
was	1
fun	1
to	1
watch,	1
but	1
perhaps	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
hard	1
to	1
do.	1
The	1
man's	1
weight	1
kept	1
the	1
harrow	1
steady,	1
and	1
let	1
the	1
teeth	1
of	1
the	1
rake	1
scratch	1
and	1
cut	1
the	1
ground	1
up,	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
stay	1
in	1
ridges.	1
"He	1
scrambles	1
the	1
ground,	1
father!"	1
said	1
Margery.	1
"It	1
needs	1
'scrambling,'"	1
laughed	1
her	1
father.	1
"We	1
are	1
going	1
to	1
get	1
more	1
weeds	1
than	1
we	1
want	1
on	1
this	1
fresh	1
soil,	1
and	1
the	1
more	1
the	1
ground	1
is	1
broken,	1
the	1
fewer	1
there	1
will	1
be."	1
[Illustration]	1
After	1
the	1
ploughing	1
and	1
harrowing,	1
the	1
man	1
drove	1
off,	1
and	1
Margery's	1
father	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
himself	1
would	1
do	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
work	1
in	1
the	1
late	1
afternoons,	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
home	1
from	1
business;	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
afford	1
too	1
much	1
help,	1
he	1
said,	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
learned	1
to	1
take	1
care	1
of	1
a	1
garden	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
boy.	1
So	1
Margery	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
any	1
more	1
done	1
until	1
the	1
next	1
day.	1
But	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
there	1
was	1
hard	1
work	1
for	1
Margery's	1
father!	1
Every	1
bit	1
of	1
that	1
ground	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
broken	1
up	1
still	1
more	1
with	1
a	1
spade,	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
clods	1
which	1
were	1
full	1
of	1
grass-roots	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
taken	1
on	1
a	1
fork	1
and	1
shaken,	1
till	1
the	1
earth	1
fell	1
out;	1
when	1
the	1
grass	1
was	1
thrown	1
to	1
one	1
side.	1
That	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
if	1
the	1
land	1
had	1
been	1
ploughed	1
in	1
the	1
autumn;	1
the	1
grass	1
would	1
have	1
rotted	1
in	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
made	1
food	1
for	1
the	1
plants.	1
Now,	1
Margery's	1
father	1
put	1
the	1
fertiliser	1
on	1
the	1
top,	1
and	1
then	1
raked	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
earth.	1
At	1
last,	1
it	1
was	1
time	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
place	1
for	1
the	1
seeds.	1
Margery	1
and	1
her	1
mother	1
helped.	1
Father	1
tied	1
one	1
end	1
of	1
a	1
cord	1
to	1
a	1
little	1
stake,	1
and	1
drove	1
the	1
stake	1
in	1
the	1
ground	1
at	1
one	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
garden.	1
Then	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
cord	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
garden	1
and	1
pulled	1
it	1
tight,	1
tied	1
it	1
to	1
another	1
stake,	1
and	1
drove	1
that	1
down.	1
That	1
made	1
a	1
straight	1
line.	1
Then	1
he	1
hoed	1
a	1
trench,	1
a	1
few	1
inches	1
deep,	1
the	1
whole	1
length	1
of	1
the	1
cord,	1
and	1
scattered	1
fertiliser	1
in	1
it.	1
Pretty	1
soon	1
the	1
whole	1
garden	1
was	1
lined	1
with	1
little	1
trenches.	1
"Now	1
for	1
the	1
seed,"	1
said	1
father.	1
Margery	1
ran	1
and	1
brought	1
the	1
seed	1
box.	1
"May	1
I	1
help?"	1
she	1
asked.	1
"If	1
you	1
watch	1
me	1
sow	1
one	1
row,	1
I	1
think	1
you	1
can	1
do	1
the	1
next,"	1
said	1
her	1
father.	1
So	1
Margery	1
watched.	1
Her	1
father	1
took	1
a	1
handful	1
of	1
peas,	1
and,	1
stooping,	1
walked	1
slowly	1
along	1
the	1
line,	1
letting	1
the	1
seed	1
trickle	1
through	1
his	1
fingers.	1
It	1
was	1
pretty	1
to	1
watch;	1
it	1
made	1
Margery	1
think	1
of	1
a	1
photograph	1
her	1
teacher	1
had,	1
a	1
photograph	1
of	1
a	1
famous	1
picture	1
called	1
"The	1
Sower."	1
Perhaps	1
you	1
have	1
seen	1
it.	1
Putting	1
in	1
the	1
seed	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
easy	1
to	1
do	1
as	1
to	1
watch;	1
sometimes	1
Margery	1
dropped	1
in	1
too	1
much,	1
and	1
sometimes	1
not	1
enough;	1
but	1
her	1
father	1
was	1
patient	1
with	1
her,	1
and	1
soon	1
she	1
did	1
better.	1
They	1
planted	1
peas,	1
beans,	1
spinach,	1
carrots,	1
and	1
parsnips.	1
And	1
Margery's	1
father	1
made	1
a	1
row	1
of	1
holes,	1
after	1
that,	1
for	1
the	1
tomato	1
plants.	1
He	1
said	1
those	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
transplanted;	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
sown	1
from	1
seed.	1
When	1
the	1
seeds	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
trenches	1
they	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
covered	1
up,	1
and	1
Margery	1
really	1
helped	1
at	1
that.	1
It	1
is	1
fun	1
to	1
do	1
it.	1
You	1
stand	1
beside	1
the	1
little	1
trench	1
and	1
walk	1
backward,	1
and	1
as	1
you	1
walk	1
you	1
hoe	1
the	1
loose	1
earth	1
back	1
over	1
the	1
seeds;	1
the	1
same	1
earth	1
that	1
was	1
hoed	1
up	1
you	1
pull	1
back	1
again.	1
Then	1
you	1
rake	1
very	1
gently	1
over	1
the	1
surface,	1
with	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
a	1
rake,	1
to	1
even	1
it	1
all	1
off.	1
Margery	1
liked	1
it,	1
because	1
now	1
the	1
garden	1
began	1
to	1
look	1
_like_	1
a	1
garden.	1
But	1
best	1
of	1
all	1
was	1
the	1
work	1
next	1
day,	1
when	1
her	1
own	1
little	1
particular	1
garden	1
was	1
begun.	1
Father	1
Brown	1
loved	1
Margery	1
and	1
Margery's	1
mother	1
so	1
much	1
that	1
he	1
wanted	1
their	1
garden	1
to	1
be	1
perfect,	1
and	1
that	1
meant	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
more	1
work.	1
He	1
knew	1
very	1
well	1
that	1
the	1
old	1
grass	1
would	1
begin	1
to	1
come	1
through	1
again	1
on	1
such	1
soil,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
make	1
terribly	1
hard	1
weeding.	1
He	1
was	1
not	1
going	1
to	1
have	1
any	1
such	1
thing	1
for	1
his	1
two	1
"little	1
girls,"	1
as	1
he	1
called	1
them.	1
So	1
he	1
gave	1
that	1
little	1
garden	1
particular	1
attention.	1
This	1
is	1
what	1
he	1
did.	1
After	1
he	1
had	1
thrown	1
out	1
all	1
the	1
turf,	1
he	1
shovelled	1
clean	1
earth	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
garden,--as	1
much	1
as	1
three	1
solid	1
inches	1
of	1
it;	1
not	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
grass	1
was	1
in	1
that.	1
Then	1
it	1
was	1
ready	1
for	1
raking	1
and	1
fertilising,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
lines.	1
The	1
little	1
footpaths	1
were	1
marked	1
out	1
by	1
Father	1
Brown's	1
feet;	1
Margery	1
and	1
her	1
mother	1
laughed	1
well	1
at	1
his	1
actions,	1
for	1
it	1
looked	1
like	1
some	1
kind	1
of	1
dance.	1
Mr	1
Brown	1
had	1
seen	1
gardeners	1
do	1
it	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
boy,	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
it	1
very	1
nicely:	1
he	1
walked	1
along	1
the	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
square,	1
with	1
one	1
foot	1
turned	1
a	1
little	1
out,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
straight,	1
taking	1
such	1
tiny	1
steps	1
that	1
his	1
feet	1
touched	1
each	1
other	1
all	1
the	1
time.	1
This	1
tramped	1
out	1
a	1
path	1
just	1
wide	1
enough	1
for	1
a	1
person	1
to	1
walk.	1
The	1
wider	1
path	1
was	1
marked	1
with	1
lines	1
and	1
raked.	1
Margery	1
thought,	1
of	1
course,	1
all	1
the	1
flowers	1
would	1
be	1
put	1
in	1
as	1
the	1
vegetables	1
were;	1
but	1
she	1
found	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
so.	1
For	1
some,	1
her	1
father	1
poked	1
little	1
holes	1
with	1
his	1
finger;	1
for	1
some,	1
he	1
made	1
very	1
shallow	1
trenches;	1
and	1
some	1
very	1
small	1
seeds	1
were	1
scattered	1
lightly	1
over	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
ground.	1
Margery	1
and	1
her	1
mother	1
had	1
taken	1
so	1
much	1
pains	1
in	1
thinking	1
out	1
the	1
arrangement	1
of	1
the	1
flowers,	1
that	1
perhaps	1
you	1
will	1
like	1
to	1
hear	1
just	1
how	1
they	1
designed	1
that	1
garden.	1
At	1
the	1
back	1
were	1
the	1
sweet	1
peas,	1
which	1
would	1
grow	1
tall,	1
like	1
a	1
screen;	1
on	1
the	1
two	1
sides,	1
for	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
hedge,	1
were	1
yellow	1
sunflowers;	1
and	1
along	1
the	1
front	1
edge	1
were	1
the	1
gay	1
nasturtiums.	1
Margery	1
planned	1
that,	1
so	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
look	1
into	1
the	1
garden	1
from	1
the	1
front,	1
but	1
have	1
it	1
shut	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
vegetable	1
patch	1
by	1
the	1
tall	1
flowers	1
on	1
the	1
sides.	1
The	1
two	1
front	1
corners	1
had	1
canariensis	1
in	1
them.	1
Canariensis	1
is	1
a	1
pretty	1
creeper	1
with	1
golden	1
blossoms,	1
very	1
dainty	1
and	1
bright.	1
And	1
then,	1
in	1
little	1
square	1
patches	1
all	1
round	1
the	1
garden,	1
were	1
planted	1
London	1
pride,	1
blue	1
bachelor's	1
buttons,	1
yellow	1
marigolds,	1
tall	1
larkspur,	1
many-coloured	1
asters,	1
hollyhocks	1
and	1
stocks.	1
All	1
these	1
lovely	1
flowers	1
used	1
to	1
grow	1
in	1
our	1
grandmothers'	1
gardens,	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
don't	1
know	1
what	1
they	1
look	1
like,	1
I	1
hope	1
you	1
can	1
find	1
out	1
next	1
summer.	1
Between	1
the	1
flowers	1
and	1
the	1
middle	1
path	1
went	1
the	1
seeds	1
for	1
that	1
wonderful	1
salad	1
garden;	1
all	1
the	1
things	1
Mrs	1
Brown	1
had	1
named	1
to	1
Margery	1
were	1
there.	1
Margery	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
anything	1
more	1
wonderful	1
than	1
the	1
little	1
round	1
lettuce-seeds.	1
They	1
were	1
so	1
tiny	1
that	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
possible	1
that	1
green	1
lettuce	1
leaves	1
could	1
come	1
from	1
them.	1
But	1
they	1
surely	1
would.	1
Mother	1
and	1
father	1
and	1
Margery	1
were	1
late	1
to	1
supper	1
that	1
evening.	1
But	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
so	1
happy	1
that	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
matter.	1
The	1
last	1
thing	1
Margery	1
thought	1
of,	1
as	1
she	1
went	1
to	1
sleep	1
at	1
night,	1
was	1
the	1
dear,	1
smooth	1
little	1
garden,	1
with	1
its	1
funny	1
footpath,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
little	1
sticks	1
standing	1
at	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
rows,	1
labelled	1
"lettuce,"	1
"beets,"	1
"helianthus,"	1
and	1
so	1
on.	1
"I	1
have	1
a	1
garden!	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
garden!"	1
was	1
Margery's	1
last	1
thought	1
as	1
she	1
went	1
off	1
to	1
dreamland.	1
THE	1
LITTLE	1
COTYLEDONS	1
This	1
is	1
another	1
story	1
about	1
Margery's	1
garden.	1
The	1
next	1
morning	1
after	1
the	1
garden	1
was	1
planted,	1
Margery	1
was	1
up	1
and	1
out	1
at	1
six	1
o'clock.	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
wait	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
her	1
garden.	1
To	1
be	1
sure,	1
she	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
seeds	1
could	1
not	1
sprout	1
in	1
a	1
single	1
night,	1
but	1
she	1
had	1
a	1
feeling	1
that	1
_something_	1
might	1
happen	1
at	1
any	1
moment.	1
The	1
garden	1
was	1
just	1
as	1
smooth	1
and	1
brown	1
as	1
the	1
night	1
before,	1
and	1
no	1
little	1
seedlings	1
were	1
in	1
sight.	1
But	1
a	1
very	1
few	1
mornings	1
after	1
that,	1
when	1
Margery	1
went	1
out,	1
she	1
saw	1
a	1
funny	1
little	1
crack	1
opening	1
up	1
through	1
the	1
earth,	1
the	1
whole	1
length	1
of	1
the	1
patch.	1
Quickly	1
she	1
knelt	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
footpath,	1
to	1
see.	1
Yes!	1
Tiny	1
green	1
leaves,	1
a	1
whole	1
row	1
of	1
them,	1
were	1
pushing	1
their	1
way	1
through	1
the	1
crust!	1
Margery	1
knew	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
put	1
there:	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
radish-row;	1
these	1
must	1
be	1
radish	1
leaves.	1
She	1
examined	1
them	1
very	1
closely,	1
so	1
that	1
she	1
might	1
know	1
a	1
radish	1
next	1
time.	1
The	1
little	1
leaves,	1
no	1
bigger	1
than	1
half	1
your	1
little-finger	1
nail,	1
grew	1
in	1
twos,--two	1
on	1
each	1
tiny	1
stem;	1
they	1
were	1
almost	1
round.	1
Margery	1
flew	1
back	1
to	1
her	1
mother,	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
the	1
first	1
seeds	1
were	1
up.	1
And	1
her	1
mother,	1
nearly	1
as	1
excited	1
as	1
Margery,	1
came	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
little	1
crack.	1
Each	1
day,	1
after	1
that,	1
the	1
row	1
of	1
radishes	1
grew,	1
till,	1
in	1
a	1
week,	1
it	1
stood	1
as	1
high	1
as	1
your	1
finger,	1
green	1
and	1
sturdy.	1
But	1
about	1
the	1
third	1
day,	1
while	1
Margery	1
was	1
stooping	1
over	1
the	1
radishes,	1
she	1
saw	1
something	1
very,	1
very	1
small	1
and	1
green,	1
peeping	1
above	1
ground,	1
where	1
the	1
lettuce	1
was	1
planted.	1
Could	1
it	1
be	1
weeds?	1
No,	1
for	1
on	1
looking	1
very	1
closely	1
she	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
wee	1
leaves	1
faintly	1
marked	1
a	1
regular	1
row.	1
They	1
did	1
not	1
make	1
a	1
crack,	1
like	1
the	1
radishes;	1
they	1
seemed	1
too	1
small	1
and	1
too	1
far	1
apart	1
to	1
push	1
the	1
earth	1
up	1
like	1
that.	1
Margery	1
leaned	1
down	1
and	1
looked	1
with	1
all	1
her	1
eyes	1
at	1
the	1
baby	1
plants.	1
The	1
tiny	1
leaves	1
grew	1
two	1
on	1
a	1
stem,	1
and	1
were	1
almost	1
round.	1
The	1
more	1
she	1
looked	1
at	1
them	1
the	1
more	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
Margery	1
that	1
they	1
looked	1
exactly	1
as	1
the	1
radish	1
looked	1
when	1
it	1
first	1
came	1
up.	1
"Do	1
you	1
suppose,"	1
Margery	1
said	1
to	1
herself,	1
"that	1
lettuce	1
and	1
radish	1
look	1
alike	1
while	1
they	1
are	1
growing?	1
They	1
don't	1
look	1
alike	1
when	1
they	1
are	1
on	1
the	1
table!"	1
Day	1
by	1
day	1
the	1
lettuce	1
grew,	1
and	1
soon	1
the	1
little	1
round	1
leaves	1
were	1
easier	1
to	1
examine;	1
they	1
certainly	1
were	1
very	1
much	1
like	1
radish	1
leaves.	1
Then,	1
one	1
morning,	1
while	1
she	1
was	1
searching	1
for	1
signs	1
of	1
other	1
seeds,	1
Margery	1
discovered	1
the	1
beets.	1
In	1
irregular	1
patches	1
on	1
the	1
row,	1
hints	1
of	1
green	1
were	1
coming.	1
The	1
next	1
day	1
and	1
the	1
next	1
they	1
grew,	1
until	1
the	1
beet	1
leaves	1
were	1
big	1
enough	1
to	1
see.	1
Margery	1
looked.	1
Then	1
she	1
looked	1
again.	1
Then	1
she	1
wrinkled	1
her	1
forehead.	1
"Can	1
we	1
have	1
made	1
a	1
mistake?"	1
she	1
thought.	1
"Do	1
you	1
suppose	1
we	1
can	1
have	1
planted	1
_all_	1
radishes?"	1
For	1
those	1
little	1
beet	1
leaves	1
were	1
almost	1
round,	1
and	1
they	1
grew	1
two	1
on	1
a	1
stem,	1
precisely	1
like	1
the	1
lettuce	1
and	1
the	1
radish;	1
except	1
for	1
the	1
size,	1
all	1
three	1
rows	1
looked	1
alike.	1
It	1
was	1
too	1
much	1
for	1
Margery.	1
She	1
ran	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
found	1
her	1
father.	1
Her	1
little	1
face	1
was	1
so	1
anxious	1
that	1
he	1
thought	1
something	1
unpleasant	1
had	1
happened.	1
"Papa,"	1
she	1
said,	1
all	1
out	1
of	1
breath,	1
"do	1
you	1
think	1
we	1
could	1
have	1
made	1
a	1
mistake	1
about	1
my	1
garden?	1
Do	1
you	1
think	1
we	1
could	1
have	1
put	1
radishes	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
rows?"	1
Father	1
laughed.	1
"What	1
makes	1
you	1
think	1
such	1
a	1
thing?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
"Papa,"	1
said	1
Margery,	1
"the	1
little	1
leaves	1
all	1
look	1
exactly	1
alike!	1
every	1
plant	1
has	1
just	1
two	1
tiny	1
leaves	1
on	1
it,	1
and	1
shaped	1
the	1
same;	1
they	1
are	1
roundish,	1
and	1
grow	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
stem	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
place."	1
Papa's	1
eyes	1
began	1
to	1
twinkle.	1
"Many	1
of	1
the	1
dicotyledonous	1
plants	1
look	1
alike	1
at	1
the	1
beginning,"	1
he	1
said,	1
with	1
a	1
little	1
drawl	1
on	1
the	1
big	1
word.	1
That	1
was	1
to	1
tease	1
Margery,	1
because	1
she	1
always	1
wanted	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
big	1
words	1
she	1
heard.	1
"What's	1
'dicotyledonous'?"	1
said	1
Margery,	1
carefully.	1
"Wait	1
till	1
I	1
come	1
home	1
to-night,	1
dear,"	1
said	1
her	1
father,	1
"and	1
I'll	1
tell	1
you."	1
That	1
evening	1
Margery	1
was	1
waiting	1
eagerly	1
for	1
him.	1
When	1
her	1
father	1
finished	1
his	1
supper	1
they	1
went	1
together	1
to	1
the	1
garden,	1
and	1
father	1
examined	1
the	1
seedlings	1
carefully.	1
Then	1
he	1
pulled	1
up	1
a	1
little	1
radish	1
plant	1
and	1
a	1
tiny	1
beet.	1
"These	1
little	1
leaves,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"are	1
not	1
the	1
real	1
leaves	1
of	1
the	1
plant;	1
they	1
are	1
only	1
little	1
pockets	1
to	1
hold	1
food	1
for	1
the	1
plant	1
to	1
live	1
on	1
till	1
it	1
gets	1
strong	1
enough	1
to	1
push	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
air.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
real	1
leaves	1
come	1
out	1
and	1
begin	1
to	1
draw	1
food	1
from	1
the	1
air,	1
these	1
little	1
substitutes	1
wither	1
up	1
and	1
fall	1
off.	1
These	1
two	1
lie	1
folded	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
little	1
seed	1
from	1
the	1
beginning,	1
and	1
are	1
full	1
of	1
plant	1
food.	1
They	1
don't	1
have	1
to	1
be	1
very	1
special	1
in	1
shape,	1
you	1
see,	1
because	1
they	1
don't	1
stay	1
on	1
the	1
plant	1
after	1
it	1
is	1
grown	1
up."	1
"Then	1
every	1
plant	1
looks	1
like	1
this	1
at	1
first?"	1
said	1
Margery.	1
"No,	1
dear,	1
not	1
every	1
one;	1
plants	1
are	1
divided	1
into	1
two	1
kinds:	1
those	1
which	1
have	1
two	1
food	1
leaves,	1
like	1
these	1
plants,	1
and	1
those	1
which	1
have	1
only	1
one;	1
these	1
are	1
called	1
dicotyledonous,	1
and	1
the	1
ones	1
which	1
have	1
but	1
one	1
food	1
leaf	1
are	1
monocotyledonous.	1
Many	1
of	1
the	1
dicotyledons	1
look	1
alike."	1
"I	1
think	1
that	1
is	1
interesting,"	1
said	1
Margery.	1
"I	1
always,	1
supposed	1
the	1
plants	1
were	1
different	1
from	1
the	1
minute	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
grow."	1
"Indeed,	1
no,"	1
said	1
father.	1
"Even	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
trees	1
look	1
like	1
this	1
when	1
they	1
first	1
come	1
through;	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
think	1
a	1
birch	1
tree	1
could	1
look	1
like	1
a	1
vegetable	1
or	1
a	1
flower,	1
would	1
you?	1
But	1
it	1
does,	1
at	1
first;	1
it	1
looks	1
so	1
much	1
like	1
these	1
things	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
great	1
nurseries,	1
where	1
trees	1
are	1
raised	1
for	1
forests	1
and	1
parks,	1
the	1
workmen	1
have	1
to	1
be	1
very	1
carefully	1
trained,	1
or	1
else	1
they	1
would	1
pull	1
up	1
the	1
trees	1
when	1
they	1
are	1
weeding.	1
They	1
have	1
to	1
be	1
taught	1
the	1
difference	1
between	1
a	1
birch	1
tree	1
and	1
a	1
weed."	1
"How	1
funny!"	1
said	1
Margery,	1
dimpling.	1
"Yes,	1
it	1
sounds	1
funny,"	1
said	1
father;	1
"but,	1
you	1
see,	1
the	1
birch	1
tree	1
is	1
dicotyledonous,	1
and	1
so	1
are	1
many	1
weeds,	1
and	1
the	1
dicotyledons	1
look	1
so	1
much	1
alike	1
at	1
first."	1
"I	1
am	1
glad	1
to	1
know	1
that,	1
father,"	1
said	1
Margery,	1
soberly.	1
"I	1
believe	1
I	1
shall	1
learn	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
from	1
living	1
in	1
the	1
country;	1
don't	1
you	1
think	1
so?"	1
Margery's	1
father	1
took	1
her	1
in	1
his	1
arms.	1
"I	1
hope	1
so,	1
dear,"	1
he	1
said;	1
"the	1
country	1
is	1
a	1
good	1
place	1
for	1
little	1
girls."	1
And	1
that	1
was	1
all	1
that	1
happened,	1
that	1
day.	1
THE	1
TALKATIVE	1
TORTOISE	1
Once	1
upon	1
a	1
time,	1
a	1
Tortoise	1
lived	1
in	1
a	1
pond	1
with	1
two	1
Ducks,	1
who	1
were	1
her	1
very	1
good	1
friends.	1
She	1
enjoyed	1
the	1
company	1
of	1
the	1
Ducks,	1
because	1
she	1
could	1
talk	1
with	1
them	1
to	1
her	1
heart's	1
content;	1
the	1
Tortoise	1
liked	1
to	1
talk.	1
She	1
always	1
had	1
something	1
to	1
say,	1
and	1
she	1
liked	1
to	1
hear	1
herself	1
say	1
it.	1
After	1
many	1
years	1
of	1
this	1
pleasant	1
living,	1
the	1
pond	1
became	1
very	1
low,	1
in	1
a	1
dry	1
season;	1
and	1
finally	1
it	1
dried	1
up.	1
The	1
two	1
Ducks	1
saw	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
no	1
longer	1
live	1
there,	1
so	1
they	1
decided	1
to	1
fly	1
to	1
another	1
region,	1
where	1
there	1
was	1
more	1
water.	1
They	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
Tortoise	1
to	1
bid	1
her	1
good-bye.	1
"Oh,	1
don't	1
leave	1
me	1
behind!"	1
begged	1
the	1
Tortoise.	1
"Take	1
me	1
with	1
you;	1
I	1
must	1
die	1
if	1
I	1
am	1
left	1
here."	1
"But	1
you	1
cannot	1
fly!"	1
said	1
the	1
Ducks.	1
"How	1
can	1
we	1
take	1
you	1
with	1
us?"	1
"Take	1
me	1
with	1
you!	1
take	1
me	1
with	1
you!"	1
said	1
the	1
Tortoise.	1
The	1
Ducks	1
felt	1
so	1
sorry	1
for	1
her	1
that	1
at	1
last	1
they	1
thought	1
of	1
a	1
way	1
to	1
take	1
her.	1
"We	1
have	1
thought	1
of	1
a	1
way	1
which	1
will	1
be	1
possible,"	1
they	1
said,	1
"if	1
only	1
you	1
can	1
manage	1
to	1
keep	1
still	1
long	1
enough.	1
We	1
will	1
each	1
take	1
hold	1
of	1
one	1
end	1
of	1
a	1
stout	1
stick,	1
and	1
do	1
you	1
take	1
the	1
middle	1
in	1
your	1
mouth;	1
then	1
we	1
will	1
fly	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
air	1
with	1
you	1
and	1
carry	1
you	1
with	1
us.	1
But	1
remember	1
not	1
to	1
talk!	1
If	1
you	1
open	1
your	1
mouth,	1
you	1
are	1
lost."	1
The	1
Tortoise	1
said	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
say	1
a	1
word;	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
move	1
her	1
mouth;	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
very	1
grateful.	1
So	1
the	1
Ducks	1
brought	1
a	1
strong	1
little	1
stick	1
and	1
took	1
hold	1
of	1
the	1
ends,	1
while	1
the	1
Tortoise	1
bit	1
firmly	1
on	1
the	1
middle.	1
Then	1
the	1
two	1
Ducks	1
rose	1
slowly	1
in	1
the	1
air	1
and	1
flew	1
away	1
with	1
their	1
burden.	1
When	1
they	1
were	1
above	1
the	1
treetops,	1
the	1
Tortoise	1
wanted	1
to	1
say,	1
"How	1
high	1
we	1
are!"	1
But	1
she	1
remembered,	1
and	1
kept	1
still.	1
When	1
they	1
passed	1
the	1
church	1
steeple	1
she	1
wanted	1
to	1
say,	1
"What	1
is	1
that	1
which	1
shines?"	1
But	1
she	1
remembered,	1
and	1
held	1
her	1
peace.	1
Then	1
they	1
came	1
over	1
the	1
village	1
square,	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
looked	1
up	1
and	1
saw	1
them.	1
"Look	1
at	1
the	1
Ducks	1
carrying	1
a	1
Tortoise!"	1
they	1
shouted;	1
and	1
every	1
one	1
ran	1
to	1
look.	1
The	1
Tortoise	1
wanted	1
to	1
say,	1
"What	1
business	1
is	1
it	1
of	1
yours?"	1
But	1
she	1
didn't.	1
Then	1
she	1
heard	1
the	1
people	1
shout,	1
"Isn't	1
it	1
strange!	1
Look	1
at	1
it!	1
Look!"	1
The	1
Tortoise	1
forgot	1
everything	1
except	1
that	1
she	1
wanted	1
to	1
say,	1
"Hush,	1
you	1
foolish	1
people!"	1
She	1
opened	1
her	1
mouth,--and	1
fell	1
to	1
the	1
ground.	1
And	1
that	1
was	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
Tortoise.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
thing	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
hold	1
one's	1
tongue!	1
ROBERT	1
OF	1
SICILY	1
An	1
old	1
legend	1
says	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
once	1
a	1
king	1
named	1
Robert	1
of	1
Sicily,	1
who	1
was	1
brother	1
to	1
the	1
Great	1
Pope	1
of	1
Rome	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor	1
of	1
Allemaine.	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
selfish	1
king,	1
and	1
very	1
proud;	1
he	1
cared	1
more	1
for	1
his	1
pleasures	1
than	1
for	1
the	1
needs	1
of	1
his	1
people,	1
and	1
his	1
heart	1
was	1
so	1
filled	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
greatness	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
thought	1
for	1
God.	1
One	1
day,	1
this	1
proud	1
king	1
was	1
sitting	1
in	1
his	1
place	1
at	1
church,	1
at	1
vesper	1
service;	1
his	1
courtiers	1
were	1
about	1
him,	1
in	1
their	1
bright	1
garments,	1
and	1
he	1
himself	1
was	1
dressed	1
in	1
his	1
royal	1
robes.	1
The	1
choir	1
was	1
chanting	1
the	1
Latin	1
service,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
beautiful	1
voices	1
swelled	1
louder,	1
the	1
king	1
noticed	1
one	1
particular	1
verse	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
repeated	1
again	1
and	1
again.	1
He	1
turned	1
to	1
a	1
learned	1
clerk	1
at	1
his	1
side	1
and	1
asked	1
what	1
those	1
words	1
meant,	1
for	1
he	1
knew	1
no	1
Latin.	1
"They	1
mean,	1
'He	1
hath	1
put	1
down	1
the	1
mighty	1
from	1
their	1
seats,	1
and	1
hath	1
exalted	1
them	1
of	1
low	1
degree,'"	1
answered	1
the	1
clerk.	1
"It	1
is	1
well	1
the	1
words	1
are	1
in	1
Latin,	1
then,"	1
said	1
the	1
king	1
angrily,	1
"for	1
they	1
are	1
a	1
lie.	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
power	1
on	1
earth	1
or	1
in	1
heaven	1
which	1
can	1
put	1
me	1
down	1
from	1
my	1
seat!"	1
and	1
he	1
sneered	1
at	1
the	1
beautiful	1
singing,	1
as	1
he	1
leaned	1
back	1
in	1
his	1
place.	1
Presently	1
the	1
king	1
fell	1
asleep,	1
while	1
the	1
service	1
went	1
on.	1
He	1
slept	1
deeply	1
and	1
long.	1
When	1
he	1
awoke	1
the	1
church	1
was	1
dark	1
and	1
still,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
all	1
alone.	1
He,	1
the	1
king,	1
had	1
been	1
left	1
alone	1
in	1
the	1
church,	1
to	1
awake	1
in	1
the	1
dark!	1
He	1
was	1
furious	1
with	1
rage	1
and	1
surprise,	1
and,	1
stumbling	1
through	1
the	1
dim	1
aisles,	1
he	1
reached	1
the	1
great	1
doors	1
and	1
beat	1
at	1
them,	1
madly,	1
shouting	1
for	1
his	1
servants.	1
The	1
old	1
sexton	1
heard	1
some	1
one	1
shouting	1
and	1
pounding	1
in	1
the	1
church,	1
and	1
thought	1
it	1
was	1
some	1
drunken	1
vagabond	1
who	1
had	1
stolen	1
in	1
during	1
the	1
service.	1
He	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
with	1
his	1
keys	1
and	1
called	1
out,	1
"Who	1
is	1
there?"	1
"Open!	1
open!	1
It	1
is	1
I,	1
the	1
king!"	1
came	1
a	1
hoarse,	1
angry	1
voice	1
from	1
within.	1
"It	1
is	1
a	1
crazy	1
man,"	1
thought	1
the	1
sexton;	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
frightened.	1
He	1
opened	1
the	1
doors	1
carefully	1
and	1
stood	1
back,	1
peering	1
into	1
the	1
darkness.	1
Out	1
past	1
him	1
rushed	1
the	1
figure	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
tattered,	1
scanty	1
clothes,	1
with	1
unkempt	1
hair	1
and	1
white,	1
wild	1
face.	1
The	1
sexton	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
ever	1
seen	1
him	1
before,	1
but	1
he	1
looked	1
long	1
after	1
him,	1
wondering	1
at	1
his	1
wildness	1
and	1
his	1
haste.	1
In	1
his	1
fluttering	1
rags,	1
without	1
hat	1
or	1
cloak,	1
not	1
knowing	1
what	1
strange	1
thing	1
had	1
happened	1
to	1
him,	1
King	1
Robert	1
rushed	1
to	1
his	1
palace	1
gates,	1
pushed	1
aside	1
the	1
startled	1
servants,	1
and	1
hurried,	1
blind	1
with	1
rage,	1
up	1
the	1
wide	1
stair	1
and	1
through	1
the	1
great	1
corridors,	1
toward	1
the	1
room	1
where	1
he	1
could	1
hear	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
his	1
courtiers'	1
voices.	1
Men	1
and	1
women	1
servants	1
tried	1
to	1
stop	1
the	1
ragged	1
man,	1
who	1
had	1
somehow	1
got	1
into	1
the	1
palace,	1
but	1
Robert	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
see	1
them	1
as	1
he	1
fled	1
along.	1
Straight	1
to	1
the	1
open	1
doors	1
of	1
the	1
big	1
banquet	1
hall	1
he	1
made	1
his	1
way,	1
and	1
into	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
grand	1
feast	1
there.	1
The	1
great	1
hall	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
lights	1
and	1
flowers;	1
the	1
tables	1
were	1
set	1
with	1
everything	1
that	1
is	1
delicate	1
and	1
rich	1
to	1
eat;	1
the	1
courtiers,	1
in	1
their	1
gay	1
clothes,	1
were	1
laughing	1
and	1
talking;	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
feast,	1
on	1
the	1
king's	1
own	1
throne,	1
sat	1
a	1
king.	1
His	1
face,	1
his	1
figure,	1
his	1
voice	1
were	1
exactly	1
like	1
Robert	1
of	1
Sicily;	1
no	1
human	1
being	1
could	1
have	1
told	1
the	1
difference;	1
no	1
one	1
dreamed	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
king.	1
He	1
was	1
dressed	1
in	1
the	1
king's	1
royal	1
robes,	1
he	1
wore	1
the	1
royal	1
crown,	1
and	1
on	1
his	1
hand	1
was	1
the	1
king's	1
own	1
ring.	1
Robert	1
of	1
Sicily,	1
half	1
naked,	1
ragged,	1
without	1
a	1
sign	1
of	1
his	1
kingship	1
on	1
him,	1
stood	1
before	1
the	1
throne	1
and	1
stared	1
with	1
fury	1
at	1
this	1
figure	1
of	1
himself.	1
The	1
king	1
on	1
the	1
throne	1
looked	1
at	1
him.	1
"Who	1
art	1
thou,	1
and	1
what	1
dost	1
thou	1
here?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
And	1
though	1
his	1
voice	1
was	1
just	1
like	1
Robert's	1
own,	1
it	1
had	1
something	1
in	1
it	1
sweet	1
and	1
deep,	1
like	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
bells.	1
"I	1
am	1
the	1
king!"	1
cried	1
Robert	1
of	1
Sicily.	1
"I	1
am	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
you	1
are	1
an	1
impostor!"	1
The	1
courtiers	1
started	1
from	1
their	1
seats,	1
and	1
drew	1
their	1
swords.	1
They	1
would	1
have	1
killed	1
the	1
crazy	1
man	1
who	1
insulted	1
their	1
king;	1
but	1
he	1
raised	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
stopped	1
them,	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
eyes	1
looking	1
into	1
Robert's	1
eyes	1
he	1
said,	1
"Not	1
the	1
king;	1
you	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
king's	1
jester!	1
You	1
shall	1
wear	1
the	1
cap	1
and	1
bells,	1
and	1
make	1
laughter	1
for	1
my	1
court.	1
You	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
servant	1
of	1
the	1
servants,	1
and	1
your	1
companion	1
shall,	1
be	1
the	1
jester's	1
ape."	1
With	1
shouts	1
of	1
laughter,	1
the	1
courtiers	1
drove	1
Robert	1
of	1
Sicily	1
from	1
the	1
banquet	1
hall;	1
the	1
waiting-men,	1
with	1
laughter,	1
too,	1
pushed	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
soldiers'	1
hall;	1
and	1
there	1
the	1
pages	1
brought	1
the	1
jester's	1
wretched	1
ape,	1
and	1
put	1
a	1
fool's	1
cap	1
and	1
bells	1
on	1
Robert's	1
head.	1
It	1
was	1
like	1
a	1
terrible	1
dream;	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
believe	1
it	1
true,	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
understand	1
what	1
had	1
happened	1
to	1
him.	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
woke	1
next	1
morning,	1
he	1
believed	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
dream,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
king	1
again.	1
But	1
as	1
he	1
turned	1
his	1
head,	1
he	1
felt	1
the	1
coarse	1
straw	1
under	1
his	1
cheek	1
instead	1
of	1
the	1
soft	1
pillow,	1
and	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
stable,	1
with	1
the	1
shivering	1
ape	1
by	1
his	1
side.	1
Robert	1
of	1
Sicily	1
was	1
a	1
jester,	1
and	1
no	1
one	1
knew	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
king.	1
Three	1
long	1
years	1
passed.	1
Sicily	1
was	1
happy	1
and	1
all	1
things	1
went	1
well	1
under	1
the	1
king,	1
who	1
was	1
not	1
Robert.	1
Robert	1
was	1
still	1
the	1
jester,	1
and	1
his	1
heart	1
grew	1
harder	1
and	1
more	1
bitter	1
with	1
every	1
year.	1
Many	1
times,	1
during	1
the	1
three	1
years,	1
the	1
king,	1
who	1
had	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
voice,	1
had	1
called	1
him	1
to	1
himself,	1
when	1
none	1
else	1
could	1
hear,	1
and	1
had	1
asked	1
him	1
the	1
one	1
question,	1
"Who	1
art	1
thou?"	1
And	1
each	1
time	1
that	1
he	1
asked	1
it	1
his	1
eyes	1
looked	1
into	1
Robert's	1
eyes,	1
to	1
find	1
his	1
heart.	1
But	1
each	1
time	1
Robert	1
threw	1
back	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
answered,	1
proudly,	1
"I	1
am	1
the	1
king!"	1
And	1
the	1
other	1
king's	1
eyes	1
grew	1
sad	1
and	1
stern.	1
At	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
three	1
years,	1
the	1
Pope	1
called	1
the	1
Emperor	1
of	1
Allemaine	1
and	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
Sicily,	1
his	1
brothers,	1
to	1
a	1
great	1
meeting	1
in	1
his	1
city	1
of	1
Rome.	1
The	1
King	1
of	1
Sicily	1
went,	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
soldiers	1
and	1
courtiers	1
and	1
servants,--a	1
great	1
procession	1
of	1
horsemen	1
and	1
footmen.	1
Never	1
had	1
there	1
been	1
seen	1
a	1
finer	1
sight	1
than	1
the	1
grand	1
train,	1
men	1
in	1
bright	1
armour,	1
riders	1
in	1
wonderful	1
cloaks	1
of	1
velvet	1
and	1
silk,	1
servants,	1
carrying	1
marvellous	1
presents	1
to	1
the	1
Pope.	1
And	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
end	1
rode	1
Robert,	1
the	1
jester.	1
His	1
horse	1
was	1
poor	1
and	1
old,	1
many-coloured,	1
and	1
the	1
ape	1
rode	1
with	1
him.	1
Every	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
villages	1
through	1
which	1
they	1
passed	1
ran	1
after	1
the	1
jester,	1
and	1
pointed	1
and	1
laughed.	1
The	1
Pope	1
received	1
his	1
brothers	1
and	1
their	1
trains	1
in	1
the	1
square	1
before	1
Saint	1
Peter's.	1
With	1
music	1
and	1
flags	1
and	1
flowers	1
he	1
made	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
Sicily	1
welcome,	1
and	1
greeted	1
him	1
as	1
his	1
brother.	1
In	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
it,	1
the	1
jester	1
broke	1
through	1
the	1
crowd	1
and	1
threw	1
himself	1
before	1
the	1
Pope.	1
"Look	1
at	1
me!"	1
he	1
cried;	1
"I	1
am	1
your	1
brother,	1
Robert	1
of	1
Sicily!	1
This	1
man	1
is	1
an	1
impostor,	1
who	1
has	1
stolen	1
my	1
throne.	1
I	1
am	1
Robert,	1
the	1
king!"	1
The	1
Pope	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
poor	1
jester	1
with	1
pity,	1
but	1
the	1
Emperor	1
of	1
Allemaine	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
Sicily,	1
and	1
said,	1
"Is	1
it	1
not	1
rather	1
dangerous,	1
brother,	1
to	1
keep	1
a	1
madman	1
as	1
jester?"	1
And	1
again	1
Robert	1
was	1
pushed	1
back	1
among	1
the	1
serving-men.	1
It	1
was	1
Holy	1
Week,	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
the	1
emperor,	1
with	1
all	1
their	1
trains,	1
went	1
every	1
day	1
to	1
the	1
great	1
services	1
in	1
the	1
cathedral.	1
Something	1
wonderful	1
and	1
holy	1
seemed	1
to	1
make	1
these	1
services	1
more	1
beautiful	1
than	1
ever	1
before.	1
All	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Rome	1
felt	1
it:	1
it	1
was	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
an	1
angel	1
were	1
there.	1
Men	1
thought	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
felt	1
His	1
blessing	1
on	1
them.	1
But	1
no	1
one	1
knew	1
who	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
brought	1
the	1
beautiful	1
feeling.	1
And	1
when	1
Easter	1
Day	1
came,	1
never	1
had	1
there	1
been	1
so	1
lovely,	1
so	1
holy	1
a	1
day:	1
in	1
the	1
great	1
churches,	1
filled	1
with	1
flowers,	1
and	1
sweet	1
with	1
incense,	1
the	1
kneeling	1
people	1
listened	1
to	1
the	1
choirs	1
singing,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
like	1
the	1
voices	1
of	1
angels;	1
their	1
prayers	1
were	1
more	1
earnest	1
than	1
ever	1
before,	1
their	1
praise	1
more	1
glad;	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
heavenly	1
in	1
Rome.	1
Robert	1
of	1
Sicily	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
services	1
with	1
the	1
rest,	1
and	1
sat	1
in	1
the	1
humblest	1
place	1
with	1
the	1
servants.	1
Over	1
and	1
over	1
again	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
sweet	1
voices	1
of	1
the	1
choirs	1
chant	1
the	1
Latin	1
words	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
long	1
ago:	1
_He	1
hath	1
put	1
down	1
the	1
mighty	1
from	1
their	1
seat,	1
and	1
hath	1
exalted	1
them	1
of	1
low	1
degree_.	1
And	1
at	1
last,	1
as	1
he	1
listened,	1
his	1
heart	1
was	1
softened.	1
He,	1
too,	1
felt	1
the	1
strange	1
blessed	1
presence	1
of	1
a	1
heavenly	1
power.	1
He	1
thought	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
wickedness;	1
he	1
remembered	1
how	1
selfish	1
he	1
had	1
been,	1
and	1
how	1
little	1
good	1
he	1
had	1
done;	1
he	1
realised,	1
that	1
his	1
power	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
from	1
himself,	1
at	1
all.	1
On	1
Easter	1
night,	1
as	1
he	1
crept	1
to	1
his	1
bed	1
of	1
straw,	1
he	1
wept,	1
not	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
wretched,	1
but	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
a	1
better	1
king	1
when	1
power	1
was	1
his.	1
At	1
last	1
all	1
the	1
festivities	1
were	1
over,	1
and	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
Sicily	1
went	1
home	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
land	1
again,	1
with	1
his	1
people.	1
Robert	1
the	1
jester	1
came	1
home	1
too.	1
On	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
their	1
home-coming,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
special	1
service	1
in	1
the	1
royal	1
church,	1
and	1
even	1
after	1
the	1
service	1
was	1
over	1
for	1
the	1
people,	1
the	1
monks	1
held	1
prayers	1
of	1
thanksgiving	1
and	1
praise.	1
The	1
sound	1
of	1
their	1
singing	1
came	1
softly	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
palace	1
windows.	1
In	1
the	1
great	1
banquet	1
room,	1
the	1
king	1
sat,	1
wearing	1
his	1
royal	1
robes	1
and	1
his	1
crown,	1
while	1
many	1
subjects	1
came	1
to	1
greet	1
him.	1
At	1
last,	1
he	1
sent	1
them	1
all	1
away,	1
saying	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
be	1
alone;	1
but	1
he	1
commanded	1
the	1
jester	1
to	1
stay.	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
alone	1
together	1
the	1
king	1
looked	1
into	1
Robert's	1
eyes,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
before,	1
and	1
said,	1
softly,	1
"Who	1
art	1
thou?"	1
Robert	1
of	1
Sicily	1
bowed	1
his	1
head.	1
"Thou	1
knowest	1
best,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"I	1
only	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
sinned."	1
As	1
he	1
spoke,	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
voices	1
of	1
the	1
monks	1
singing,	1
_He	1
hath	1
put	1
down	1
the	1
mighty	1
from	1
their	1
seat_,--and	1
his	1
head	1
sank	1
lower.	1
But	1
suddenly	1
the	1
music	1
seemed	1
to	1
change;	1
a	1
wonderful	1
light	1
shone	1
all	1
about.	1
As	1
Robert	1
raised	1
his	1
eyes,	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
smiling	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
radiance	1
like	1
nothing	1
on	1
earth,	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
sank	1
to	1
his	1
knees	1
before	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
that	1
smile,	1
a	1
voice	1
sounded	1
with	1
the	1
music,	1
like	1
a	1
melody	1
throbbing	1
on	1
a	1
single	1
string,--	1
"I	1
am	1
an	1
angel,	1
and	1
thou	1
art	1
the	1
king!"	1
Then	1
Robert	1
of	1
Sicily	1
was	1
alone.	1
His	1
royal	1
robes	1
were	1
upon	1
him	1
once	1
more;	1
he	1
wore	1
his	1
crown	1
and	1
his	1
royal	1
ring.	1
He	1
was	1
king.	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
courtiers	1
came	1
back	1
they	1
found	1
their	1
king	1
kneeling	1
by	1
his	1
throne,	1
absorbed	1
in	1
silent	1
prayer.	1
THE	1
JEALOUS	1
COURTIERS	1
I	1
wonder	1
if	1
you	1
have	1
ever	1
heard	1
the	1
anecdote	1
about	1
the	1
artist	1
of	1
Duesseldorf	1
and	1
the	1
jealous	1
courtiers.	1
This	1
is	1
it.	1
It	1
seems	1
there	1
was	1
once	1
a	1
very	1
famous	1
artist	1
who	1
lived	1
in	1
the	1
little	1
town	1
of	1
Duesseldorf.	1
He	1
did	1
such	1
fine	1
work	1
that	1
the	1
Elector,	1
Prince	1
Johann	1
Wilhelm,	1
ordered	1
a	1
portrait	1
statue	1
of	1
himself,	1
on	1
horseback,	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
in	1
bronze.	1
The	1
artist	1
was	1
overjoyed	1
at	1
the	1
commission,	1
and	1
worked	1
early	1
and	1
late	1
at	1
the	1
statue.	1
At	1
last	1
the	1
work	1
was	1
done,	1
and	1
the	1
artist	1
had	1
the	1
great	1
statue	1
set	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
public	1
square	1
of	1
Duesseldorf,	1
ready	1
for	1
the	1
opening	1
view.	1
The	1
Elector	1
came	1
on	1
the	1
appointed	1
day,	1
and	1
with	1
him	1
came	1
his	1
favourite	1
courtiers	1
from	1
the	1
castle.	1
Then	1
the	1
statue	1
was	1
unveiled.	1
It	1
was	1
very	1
beautiful,--so	1
beautiful	1
that	1
the	1
prince	1
exclaimed	1
in	1
surprise.	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
look	1
enough,	1
and	1
presently	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
artist	1
and	1
shook	1
hands	1
with	1
him,	1
like	1
an	1
old	1
friend.	1
"Herr	1
Grupello,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"you	1
are	1
a	1
great	1
artist,	1
and	1
this	1
statue	1
will	1
make	1
your	1
fame	1
even	1
greater	1
than	1
it	1
is;	1
the	1
portrait	1
of	1
me	1
is	1
perfect!"	1
When	1
the	1
courtiers	1
heard	1
this,	1
and	1
saw	1
the	1
friendly	1
hand-shake,	1
their	1
jealousy	1
of	1
the	1
artist	1
was	1
beyond	1
bounds.	1
Their	1
one	1
thought	1
was,	1
how	1
could	1
they	1
safely	1
do	1
something	1
to	1
humiliate	1
him.	1
They	1
dared	1
not	1
pick	1
flaws	1
in	1
the	1
portrait	1
statue,	1
for	1
the	1
prince	1
had	1
declared	1
it	1
perfect.	1
But	1
at	1
last	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
said,	1
with	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
great	1
frankness,	1
"Indeed,	1
Herr	1
Grupello,	1
the	1
portrait	1
of	1
his	1
Royal	1
Highness	1
is	1
perfect;	1
but	1
permit	1
me	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
the	1
statue	1
of	1
the	1
horse	1
is	1
not	1
quite	1
so	1
successful:	1
the	1
head	1
is	1
too	1
large;	1
it	1
is	1
out	1
of	1
proportion."	1
"No,"	1
said	1
another,	1
"the	1
horse	1
is	1
really	1
not	1
so	1
successful;	1
the	1
turn	1
of	1
the	1
neck,	1
there,	1
is	1
awkward."	1
"If	1
you	1
would	1
change	1
the	1
right	1
hind-foot,	1
Herr	1
Grupello,"	1
said	1
a	1
third,	1
"it	1
would	1
be	1
an	1
improvement."	1
Still	1
another	1
found	1
fault	1
with	1
the	1
horse's	1
tail.	1
The	1
artist	1
listened,	1
quietly.	1
When	1
they	1
had	1
all	1
finished,	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
prince	1
and	1
said,	1
"Your	1
courtiers,	1
prince,	1
find	1
a	1
good	1
many	1
flaws	1
in	1
the	1
statue	1
of	1
the	1
horse;	1
will	1
you	1
permit	1
me	1
to	1
keep	1
it	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
more,	1
to	1
do	1
what	1
I	1
can	1
with	1
it?"	1
The	1
Elector	1
assented,	1
and	1
the	1
artist	1
ordered	1
a	1
temporary	1
screen	1
to	1
be	1
built	1
around	1
the	1
statue,	1
so	1
that	1
his	1
assistants	1
could	1
work	1
undisturbed.	1
For	1
several	1
days	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
hammering	1
came	1
steadily	1
from	1
behind	1
the	1
enclosure.	1
The	1
courtiers,	1
who	1
took	1
care	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
way,	1
often,	1
were	1
delighted.	1
Each	1
one	1
said	1
to	1
himself,	1
"I	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
right,	1
really;	1
the	1
artist	1
himself	1
sees	1
that	1
something	1
was	1
wrong;	1
now	1
I	1
shall	1
have	1
credit	1
for	1
saving	1
the	1
prince's	1
portrait	1
by	1
my	1
artistic	1
taste!"	1
Once	1
more	1
the	1
artist	1
summoned	1
the	1
prince	1
and	1
his	1
courtiers,	1
and	1
once	1
more	1
the	1
statue	1
was	1
unveiled.	1
Again	1
the	1
Elector	1
exclaimed	1
at	1
its	1
beauty,	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
his	1
courtiers,	1
one	1
after	1
another,	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
they	1
had	1
to	1
say.	1
"Perfect!"	1
said	1
the	1
first.	1
"Now	1
that	1
the	1
horse's	1
head	1
is	1
in	1
proportion,	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
flaw."	1
"The	1
change	1
in	1
the	1
neck	1
was	1
just	1
what	1
was	1
needed,"	1
said	1
the	1
second;	1
"it	1
is	1
very	1
graceful	1
now."	1
"The	1
rear	1
right	1
foot	1
is	1
as	1
it	1
should	1
be,	1
now,"	1
said	1
a	1
third,	1
"and	1
it	1
adds	1
so	1
much	1
to	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
the	1
whole!"	1
The	1
fourth	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
considered	1
the	1
tail	1
greatly	1
improved.	1
"My	1
courtiers	1
are	1
much	1
pleased	1
now,"	1
said	1
the	1
prince	1
to	1
Herr	1
Grupello;	1
"they	1
think	1
the	1
statue	1
much	1
improved	1
by	1
the	1
changes	1
you	1
have	1
made."	1
Herr	1
Grupello	1
smiled	1
a	1
little.	1
"I	1
am	1
glad	1
they	1
are	1
pleased,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"but	1
the	1
fact	1
is,	1
I	1
have	1
changed	1
nothing!"	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
mean?"	1
said	1
the	1
prince	1
in	1
surprise.	1
"Have	1
we	1
not	1
heard	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
hammering	1
every	1
day?	1
What	1
were	1
you	1
hammering	1
at	1
then?"	1
"I	1
was	1
hammering	1
at	1
the	1
reputation	1
of	1
your	1
courtiers,	1
who	1
found	1
fault	1
simply	1
because	1
they	1
were	1
jealous,"	1
said	1
the	1
artist.	1
"And	1
I	1
rather	1
think	1
that	1
their	1
reputation	1
is	1
pretty	1
well	1
hammered	1
to	1
pieces!"	1
It	1
was,	1
indeed.	1
The	1
Elector	1
laughed	1
heartily,	1
but	1
the	1
courtiers	1
slunk	1
away,	1
one	1
after	1
another,	1
without	1
a	1
word.	1
PRINCE	1
CHERRY	1
There	1
was	1
once	1
an	1
old	1
king,	1
so	1
wise	1
and	1
kind	1
and	1
true	1
that	1
the	1
most	1
powerful	1
good	1
fairy	1
of	1
his	1
land	1
visited	1
him	1
and	1
asked	1
him	1
to	1
name	1
the	1
dearest	1
wish	1
of	1
his	1
heart,	1
that	1
she	1
might	1
grant	1
it.	1
"Surely	1
you	1
know	1
it,"	1
said	1
the	1
good	1
king;	1
"it	1
is	1
for	1
my	1
only	1
son,	1
Prince	1
Cherry;	1
do	1
for	1
him	1
whatever	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
done	1
for	1
me."	1
"Gladly,"	1
said	1
the	1
great	1
fairy;	1
"choose	1
what	1
I	1
shall	1
give	1
him.	1
I	1
can	1
make	1
him	1
the	1
richest,	1
the	1
most	1
beautiful,	1
or	1
the	1
most	1
powerful	1
prince	1
in	1
the	1
world;	1
choose."	1
"None	1
of	1
those	1
things	1
are	1
what	1
I	1
want,"	1
said	1
the	1
king.	1
"I	1
want	1
only	1
that	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
good.	1
Of	1
what	1
use	1
will	1
it	1
be	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
beautiful,	1
rich,	1
or	1
powerful,	1
if	1
he	1
grows	1
into	1
a	1
bad	1
man?	1
Make	1
him	1
the	1
best	1
prince	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
I	1
beg	1
you!"	1
"Alas,	1
I	1
cannot	1
make	1
him	1
good,"	1
said	1
the	1
fairy;	1
"he	1
must	1
do	1
that	1
for	1
himself.	1
I	1
can	1
give	1
him	1
good	1
advice,	1
reprove	1
him	1
when	1
he	1
does	1
wrong,	1
and	1
punish	1
him	1
if	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
punish	1
himself;	1
I	1
can	1
and	1
will	1
be	1
his	1
best	1
friend,	1
but	1
I	1
cannot	1
make	1
him	1
good	1
unless	1
he	1
wills	1
it."	1
The	1
king	1
was	1
sad	1
to	1
hear	1
this,	1
but	1
he	1
rejoiced	1
in	1
the	1
friendship	1
of	1
the	1
fairy	1
for	1
his	1
son.	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
died,	1
soon	1
after,	1
he	1
was	1
happy	1
to	1
know	1
that	1
he	1
left	1
Prince	1
Cherry	1
in	1
her	1
hands.	1
Prince	1
Cherry	1
grieved	1
for	1
his	1
father,	1
and	1
often	1
lay	1
awake	1
at	1
night,	1
thinking	1
of	1
him.	1
One	1
night,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
all	1
alone	1
in	1
his	1
room,	1
a	1
soft	1
and	1
lovely	1
light	1
suddenly	1
shone	1
before	1
him,	1
and	1
a	1
beautiful	1
vision	1
stood	1
at	1
his	1
side.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
good	1
fairy.	1
She	1
was	1
clad	1
in	1
robes	1
of	1
dazzling	1
white,	1
and	1
on	1
her	1
shining	1
hair	1
she	1
wore	1
a	1
wreath	1
of	1
white	1
roses.	1
"I	1
am	1
the	1
Fairy	1
Candide,"	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
prince.	1
"I	1
promised	1
your	1
father	1
that	1
I	1
would	1
be	1
your	1
best	1
friend,	1
and	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
you	1
live	1
I	1
shall	1
watch	1
over	1
your	1
happiness.	1
I	1
have	1
brought	1
you	1
a	1
gift;	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
wonderful	1
to	1
look	1
at,	1
but	1
it	1
has	1
a	1
wonderful	1
power	1
for	1
your	1
welfare;	1
wear	1
it,	1
and	1
let	1
it	1
help	1
you."	1
As	1
she	1
spoke,	1
she	1
placed	1
a	1
small	1
gold	1
ring	1
on	1
the	1
prince's	1
little	1
finger.	1
"This	1
ring,"	1
she	1
said,	1
"will	1
help	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
good;	1
when	1
you	1
do	1
evil,	1
it	1
will	1
prick	1
you,	1
to	1
remind	1
you.	1
If	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
heed	1
its	1
warnings	1
a	1
worse	1
thing	1
will	1
happen	1
to	1
you,	1
for	1
I	1
shall	1
become	1
your	1
enemy."	1
Then	1
she	1
vanished.	1
Prince	1
Cherry	1
wore	1
his	1
ring,	1
and	1
said	1
nothing	1
to	1
anyone	1
of	1
the	1
fairy's	1
gift.	1
It	1
did	1
not	1
prick	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time,	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
good	1
and	1
merry	1
and	1
happy.	1
But	1
Prince	1
Cherry	1
had	1
been	1
rather	1
spoiled	1
by	1
his	1
nurse	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
child;	1
she	1
had	1
always	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
when	1
he	1
should	1
become	1
king	1
he	1
could	1
do	1
exactly	1
as	1
he	1
pleased.	1
Now,	1
after	1
a	1
while,	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
not	1
true,	1
and	1
it	1
made	1
him	1
angry.	1
The	1
first	1
time	1
that	1
he	1
noticed	1
that	1
even	1
a	1
king	1
could	1
not	1
always	1
have	1
his	1
own	1
way	1
was	1
on	1
a	1
day	1
when	1
he	1
went	1
hunting.	1
It	1
happened	1
that	1
he	1
got	1
no	1
game.	1
This	1
put	1
him	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
bad	1
temper	1
that	1
he	1
grumbled	1
and	1
scolded	1
all	1
the	1
way	1
home.	1
The	1
little	1
gold	1
ring	1
began	1
to	1
feel	1
tight	1
and	1
uncomfortable.	1
When	1
he	1
reached	1
the	1
palace	1
his	1
pet	1
dog	1
ran	1
to	1
meet	1
him.	1
"Go	1
away!"	1
said	1
the	1
prince,	1
crossly.	1
But	1
the	1
little	1
dog	1
was	1
so	1
used	1
to	1
being	1
petted	1
that	1
he	1
only	1
jumped	1
up	1
on	1
his	1
master,	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
kiss	1
his	1
hand.	1
The	1
prince	1
turned	1
and	1
kicked	1
the	1
little	1
creature.	1
At	1
the	1
instant,	1
he	1
felt	1
a	1
sharp	1
prick	1
in	1
his	1
little	1
finger,	1
like	1
a	1
pin	1
prick.	1
"What	1
nonsense!"	1
said	1
the	1
prince	1
to	1
himself.	1
"Am	1
I	1
not	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
land?	1
May	1
I	1
not	1
kick	1
my	1
own	1
dog,	1
if	1
I	1
choose?	1
What	1
evil	1
is	1
there	1
in	1
that?"	1
A	1
silver	1
voice	1
spoke	1
in	1
his	1
ear:	1
"The	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
has	1
a	1
right	1
to	1
do	1
good,	1
but	1
not	1
evil;	1
you	1
have	1
been	1
guilty	1
of	1
bad	1
temper	1
and	1
of	1
cruelty	1
to-day;	1
see	1
that	1
you	1
do	1
better	1
to-morrow."	1
The	1
prince	1
turned	1
sharply,	1
but	1
no	1
one	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
seen;	1
yet	1
he	1
recognised	1
the	1
voice	1
as	1
that	1
of	1
Fairy	1
Candide.	1
He	1
followed	1
her	1
advice	1
for	1
a	1
little,	1
but	1
presently	1
he	1
forgot,	1
and	1
the	1
ring	1
pricked	1
him	1
so	1
sharply	1
that	1
his	1
finger	1
had	1
a	1
drop	1
of	1
blood	1
on	1
it.	1
This	1
happened	1
again	1
and	1
again,	1
for	1
the	1
prince	1
grew	1
more	1
self-willed	1
and	1
headstrong	1
every	1
day;	1
he	1
had	1
some	1
bad	1
friends,	1
too,	1
who	1
urged	1
him	1
on,	1
in	1
the	1
hope	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
ruin	1
himself	1
and	1
give	1
them	1
a	1
chance	1
to	1
seize	1
the	1
throne.	1
He	1
treated	1
his	1
people	1
carelessly	1
and	1
his	1
servants	1
cruelly,	1
and	1
everything	1
he	1
wanted	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
have.	1
The	1
ring	1
annoyed	1
him	1
terribly;	1
it	1
was	1
embarrassing	1
for	1
a	1
king	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
drop	1
of	1
blood	1
on	1
his	1
finger	1
all	1
the	1
time!	1
At	1
last	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
ring	1
off	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
out	1
of	1
sight.	1
Then	1
he	1
thought	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
perfectly	1
happy,	1
having	1
his	1
own	1
way;	1
but	1
instead,	1
he	1
grew	1
more	1
unhappy	1
as	1
he	1
grew	1
less	1
good.	1
Whenever	1
he	1
was	1
crossed,	1
or	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
his	1
own	1
way	1
instantly,	1
he	1
flew	1
into	1
a	1
passion.	1
Finally,	1
he	1
wanted	1
something	1
that	1
he	1
really	1
could	1
not	1
have.	1
This	1
time	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
most	1
beautiful	1
young	1
girl,	1
named	1
Zelia;	1
the	1
prince	1
saw	1
her,	1
and	1
loved	1
her	1
so	1
much	1
that	1
he	1
wanted	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
his	1
queen.	1
To	1
his	1
great	1
astonishment,	1
she	1
refused.	1
"Am	1
I	1
not	1
pleasing	1
to	1
you?"	1
asked	1
the	1
prince	1
in	1
surprise.	1
"You	1
are	1
very	1
handsome,	1
very	1
charming,	1
prince,"	1
said	1
Zelia;	1
"but	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
like	1
the	1
good	1
king,	1
your	1
father;	1
I	1
fear	1
you	1
would	1
make	1
me	1
very	1
miserable	1
if	1
I	1
were	1
your	1
queen."	1
In	1
a	1
great	1
rage,	1
Prince	1
Cherry	1
ordered	1
the	1
young	1
girl	1
to	1
be	1
put	1
in	1
prison;	1
and	1
the	1
key	1
of	1
her	1
dungeon	1
he	1
kept.	1
He	1
told	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
friends,	1
a	1
wicked	1
man	1
who	1
flattered	1
him	1
for	1
his	1
own	1
purposes,	1
about	1
the	1
thing,	1
and	1
asked	1
his	1
advice.	1
"Are	1
you	1
not	1
king?"	1
said	1
the	1
bad	1
friend.	1
"May	1
you	1
not	1
do	1
as	1
you	1
will?	1
Keep	1
the	1
girl	1
in	1
a	1
dungeon	1
till	1
she	1
does	1
as	1
you	1
command,	1
and	1
if	1
she	1
will	1
not,	1
sell	1
her	1
as	1
a	1
slave."	1
"But	1
would	1
it	1
not	1
be	1
a	1
disgrace	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
harm	1
an	1
innocent	1
creature?"	1
said	1
the	1
prince.	1
"It	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
disgrace	1
to	1
you	1
to	1
have	1
it	1
said	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
your	1
subjects	1
dared	1
disobey	1
you!"	1
said	1
the	1
courtier.	1
He	1
had	1
cleverly	1
touched	1
the	1
prince's	1
worst	1
trait,	1
his	1
pride.	1
Prince	1
Cherry	1
went	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
Zelia's	1
dungeon,	1
prepared	1
to	1
do	1
this	1
cruel	1
thing.	1
Zelia	1
was	1
gone.	1
No	1
one	1
had	1
the	1
key	1
save	1
the	1
prince	1
himself;	1
yet	1
she	1
was	1
gone.	1
The	1
only	1
person	1
who	1
could	1
have	1
dared	1
to	1
help	1
her,	1
thought	1
the	1
prince,	1
was	1
his	1
old	1
tutor,	1
Suliman,	1
the	1
only	1
man	1
left	1
who	1
ever	1
rebuked	1
him	1
for	1
anything.	1
In	1
fury,	1
he	1
ordered	1
Suliman	1
to	1
be	1
put	1
in	1
fetters	1
and	1
brought	1
before	1
him.	1
As	1
his	1
servants	1
left	1
him,	1
to	1
carry	1
out	1
the	1
wicked	1
order,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
clash,	1
as	1
of	1
thunder,	1
in	1
the	1
room,	1
and	1
then	1
a	1
blinding	1
light.	1
Fairy	1
Candide	1
stood	1
before	1
him.	1
Her	1
beautiful	1
face	1
was	1
stern,	1
and	1
her	1
silver	1
voice	1
rang	1
like	1
a	1
trumpet,	1
as	1
she	1
said,	1
"Wicked	1
and	1
selfish	1
prince,	1
you	1
have	1
become	1
baser	1
than	1
the	1
beasts	1
you	1
hunt;	1
you	1
are	1
furious	1
as	1
a	1
lion,	1
revengeful	1
as	1
a	1
serpent,	1
greedy	1
as	1
a	1
wolf,	1
and	1
brutal	1
as	1
a	1
bull;	1
take,	1
therefore,	1
the	1
shape	1
of	1
those	1
beasts	1
whom	1
you	1
resemble!"	1
With	1
horror,	1
the	1
prince	1
felt	1
himself	1
being	1
transformed	1
into	1
a	1
monster.	1
He	1
tried	1
to	1
rush	1
upon	1
the	1
fairy	1
and	1
kill	1
her,	1
but	1
she	1
had	1
vanished	1
with	1
her	1
words.	1
As	1
he	1
stood,	1
her	1
voice	1
came	1
from	1
the	1
air,	1
saying,	1
sadly,	1
"Learn	1
to	1
conquer	1
your	1
pride	1
by	1
being	1
in	1
submission	1
to	1
your	1
own	1
subjects."	1
At	1
the	1
same	1
moment,	1
Prince	1
Cherry	1
felt	1
himself	1
being	1
transported	1
to	1
a	1
distant	1
forest,	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
set	1
down	1
by	1
a	1
clear	1
stream.	1
In	1
the	1
water	1
he	1
saw	1
his	1
own	1
terrible	1
image;	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
a	1
lion,	1
with	1
bull's	1
horns,	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
a	1
wolf,	1
and	1
a	1
tail	1
like	1
a	1
serpent.	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
gazed	1
in	1
horror,	1
the	1
fairy's	1
voice	1
whispered,	1
"Your	1
soul	1
has	1
become	1
more	1
ugly	1
than	1
your	1
shape	1
is;	1
you	1
yourself	1
have	1
deformed	1
it."	1
The	1
poor	1
beast	1
rushed	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
her	1
words,	1
but	1
in	1
a	1
moment	1
he	1
stumbled	1
into	1
a	1
trap,	1
set	1
by	1
bear-catchers.	1
When	1
the	1
trappers	1
found	1
him	1
they	1
were	1
delighted	1
to	1
have	1
caught	1
a	1
curiosity,	1
and	1
they	1
immediately	1
dragged	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
palace	1
courtyard.	1
There	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
whole	1
court	1
buzzing	1
with	1
gossip.	1
Prince	1
Cherry	1
had	1
been	1
struck	1
by	1
lightning	1
and	1
killed,	1
was	1
the	1
news,	1
and	1
the	1
five	1
favourite	1
courtiers	1
had	1
struggled	1
to	1
make	1
themselves	1
rulers,	1
but	1
the	1
people	1
had	1
refused	1
them,	1
and	1
offered	1
the	1
crown	1
to	1
Suliman,	1
the	1
good	1
old	1
tutor.	1
Even	1
as	1
he	1
heard	1
this,	1
the	1
prince	1
saw	1
Suliman	1
on	1
the	1
steps	1
of	1
the	1
palace,	1
speaking	1
to	1
the	1
people.	1
"I	1
will	1
take	1
the	1
crown	1
to	1
keep	1
in	1
trust,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"Perhaps	1
the	1
prince	1
is	1
not	1
dead."	1
"He	1
was	1
a	1
bad	1
king;	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
want	1
him	1
back,"	1
said	1
the	1
people.	1
"I	1
know	1
his	1
heart,"	1
said	1
Suliman,	1
"it	1
is	1
not	1
all	1
bad;	1
it	1
is	1
tainted,	1
but	1
not	1
corrupt;	1
perhaps	1
he	1
will	1
repent	1
and	1
come	1
back	1
to	1
us	1
a	1
good	1
king."	1
When	1
the	1
beast	1
heard	1
this,	1
it	1
touched	1
him	1
so	1
much	1
that	1
he	1
stopped	1
tearing	1
at	1
his	1
chains,	1
and	1
became	1
gentle.	1
He	1
let	1
his	1
keepers	1
lead	1
him	1
away	1
to	1
the	1
royal	1
menagerie	1
without	1
hurting	1
them.	1
Life	1
was	1
very	1
terrible	1
to	1
the	1
prince,	1
now,	1
but	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
brought	1
all	1
his	1
sorrow	1
on	1
himself,	1
and	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
bear	1
it	1
patiently.	1
The	1
worst	1
to	1
bear	1
was	1
the	1
cruelty	1
of	1
the	1
keeper.	1
At	1
last,	1
one	1
night,	1
this	1
keeper	1
was	1
in	1
great	1
danger;	1
a	1
tiger	1
got	1
loose,	1
and	1
attacked	1
him.	1
"Good	1
enough!	1
Let	1
him	1
die!"	1
thought	1
Prince	1
Cherry.	1
But	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
how	1
helpless	1
the	1
keeper	1
was,	1
he	1
repented,	1
and	1
sprang	1
to	1
help.	1
He	1
killed	1
the	1
tiger	1
and	1
saved	1
the	1
keeper's	1
life.	1
As	1
he	1
crouched	1
at	1
the	1
keeper's	1
feet,	1
a	1
voice	1
said,	1
"Good	1
actions	1
never	1
go	1
unrewarded!"	1
And	1
the	1
terrible	1
monster	1
was	1
changed	1
into	1
a	1
pretty	1
little	1
white	1
dog.	1
The	1
keeper	1
carried	1
the	1
beautiful	1
little	1
dog	1
to	1
the	1
court	1
and	1
told	1
the	1
story,	1
and	1
from	1
then	1
on,	1
Cherry	1
was	1
carefully	1
treated,	1
and	1
had	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
everything.	1
But	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
little	1
dog	1
from	1
growing,	1
the	1
queen	1
ordered	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
fed	1
very	1
little,	1
and	1
that	1
was	1
pretty	1
hard	1
for	1
the	1
poor	1
prince.	1
He	1
was	1
often	1
half	1
starved,	1
although	1
so	1
much	1
petted.	1
One	1
day	1
he	1
had	1
carried	1
his	1
crust	1
of	1
bread	1
to	1
a	1
retired	1
spot	1
in	1
the	1
palace	1
woods,	1
where	1
he	1
loved	1
to	1
be,	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
a	1
poor	1
old	1
woman	1
hunting	1
for	1
roots,	1
and	1
seeming	1
almost	1
starved.	1
"Poor	1
thing,"	1
he	1
thought,	1
"she	1
is	1
even	1
more	1
hungry	1
than	1
I";	1
and	1
he	1
ran	1
up	1
and	1
dropped	1
the	1
crust	1
at	1
her	1
feet.	1
The	1
woman	1
ate	1
it,	1
and	1
seemed	1
greatly	1
refreshed.	1
Cherry	1
was	1
glad	1
of	1
that,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
running	1
happily	1
back	1
to	1
his	1
kennel	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
cries	1
of	1
distress,	1
and	1
suddenly	1
he	1
saw	1
some	1
rough	1
men	1
dragging	1
along	1
a	1
young	1
girl,	1
who	1
was	1
weeping	1
and	1
crying	1
for	1
help.	1
What	1
was	1
his	1
horror	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
the	1
young	1
girl	1
was	1
Zelia!	1
Oh,	1
how	1
he	1
wished	1
he	1
were	1
the	1
monster	1
once	1
more,	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
kill	1
the	1
men	1
and	1
rescue	1
her!	1
But	1
he	1
could	1
do	1
nothing	1
except	1
bark,	1
and	1
bite	1
at	1
the	1
heels	1
of	1
the	1
wicked	1
men.	1
That	1
did	1
not	1
stop	1
them;	1
they	1
drove	1
him	1
off,	1
with	1
blows,	1
and	1
carried	1
Zelia	1
into	1
a	1
palace	1
in	1
the	1
wood.	1
Poor	1
Cherry	1
crouched	1
by	1
the	1
steps,	1
and	1
watched.	1
His	1
heart	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
pity	1
and	1
rage.	1
But	1
suddenly	1
he	1
thought,	1
"I	1
was	1
as	1
bad	1
as	1
these	1
men;	1
I	1
myself	1
put	1
Zelia	1
in	1
prison,	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
treated	1
her	1
worse	1
still,	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
prevented."	1
The	1
thought	1
made	1
him	1
so	1
sorry	1
and	1
ashamed	1
that	1
he	1
repented	1
bitterly	1
the	1
evil	1
he	1
had	1
done.	1
Presently	1
a	1
window	1
opened,	1
and	1
Cherry	1
saw	1
Zelia	1
lean	1
out	1
and	1
throw	1
down	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
meat.	1
He	1
seized	1
it	1
and	1
was	1
just	1
going	1
to	1
devour	1
it,	1
when	1
the	1
old	1
woman	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
his	1
crust	1
snatched	1
it	1
away	1
and	1
took	1
him	1
in	1
her	1
arms.	1
"No,	1
you	1
shall	1
not	1
eat	1
it,	1
you	1
poor	1
little	1
thing,"	1
she	1
said,	1
"for	1
every	1
bit	1
of	1
food	1
in	1
that	1
house	1
is	1
poisoned."	1
At	1
the	1
same	1
moment,	1
a	1
voice	1
said,	1
"Good	1
actions	1
never	1
go	1
unrewarded!"	1
And	1
instantly	1
Prince	1
Cherry	1
was	1
transformed	1
into	1
a	1
little	1
white	1
dove.	1
With	1
great	1
joy,	1
he	1
flew	1
to	1
the	1
open	1
palace	1
window	1
to	1
seek	1
out	1
his	1
Zelia,	1
to	1
try	1
to	1
help	1
her.	1
But	1
though	1
he	1
hunted	1
in	1
every	1
room,	1
no	1
Zelia	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
found.	1
He	1
had	1
to	1
fly	1
away,	1
without	1
seeing	1
her.	1
He	1
wanted	1
more	1
than	1
anything	1
else	1
to	1
find	1
her,	1
and	1
stay	1
near	1
her,	1
so	1
he	1
flew	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
world,	1
to	1
seek	1
her.	1
He	1
sought	1
her	1
in	1
many	1
lands,	1
until	1
one	1
day,	1
in	1
a	1
far	1
eastern	1
country,	1
he	1
found	1
her	1
sitting	1
in	1
a	1
tent,	1
by	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
an	1
old,	1
white-haired	1
hermit.	1
Cherry	1
was	1
wild	1
with	1
delight.	1
He	1
flew	1
to	1
her	1
shoulder,	1
caressed	1
her	1
hair	1
with	1
his	1
beak,	1
and	1
cooed	1
in	1
her	1
ear.	1
"You	1
dear,	1
lovely	1
little	1
thing!"	1
said	1
Zelia.	1
"Will	1
you	1
stay	1
with	1
me?	1
If	1
you	1
will,	1
I	1
will	1
love	1
you	1
always."	1
"Ah,	1
Zelia,	1
see	1
what	1
you	1
have	1
done!"	1
laughed	1
the	1
hermit.	1
At	1
that	1
instant,	1
the	1
white	1
dove	1
vanished,	1
and	1
Prince	1
Cherry	1
stood	1
there,	1
as	1
handsome	1
and	1
charming	1
as	1
ever,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
kindness	1
and	1
modesty	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
which	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
there	1
before.	1
At	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
the	1
hermit	1
stood	1
up,	1
his	1
flowing	1
hair	1
changed	1
to	1
shining	1
gold,	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
became	1
a	1
lovely	1
woman's	1
face;	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
Fairy	1
Candide.	1
"Zelia	1
has	1
broken	1
your	1
spell,"	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
prince,	1
"as	1
I	1
meant	1
she	1
should,	1
when	1
you	1
were	1
worthy	1
of	1
her	1
love."	1
Zelia	1
and	1
Prince	1
Cherry	1
fell	1
at	1
the	1
fairy's	1
feet.	1
But	1
with	1
a	1
beautiful	1
smile	1
she	1
bade	1
them	1
come	1
to	1
their	1
kingdom.	1
In	1
a	1
trice,	1
they	1
were	1
transported	1
to	1
the	1
prince's	1
palace,	1
where	1
King	1
Suliman	1
greeted	1
them	1
with	1
tears	1
of	1
joy.	1
He	1
gave	1
back	1
the	1
throne	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
heart,	1
and	1
King	1
Cherry	1
ruled	1
again,	1
with	1
Zelia	1
for	1
his	1
queen.	1
He	1
wore	1
the	1
little	1
gold	1
ring	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
his	1
life,	1
but	1
never	1
once	1
did	1
it	1
have	1
to	1
prick	1
him	1
hard	1
enough	1
to	1
make	1
his	1
finger	1
bleed.	1
THE	1
GOLD	1
IN	1
THE	1
ORCHARD	1
There	1
was	1
once	1
a	1
farmer	1
who	1
had	1
a	1
fine	1
olive	1
orchard.	1
He	1
was	1
very	1
industrious,	1
and	1
the	1
farm	1
always	1
prospered	1
under	1
his	1
care.	1
But	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
his	1
three	1
sons	1
despised	1
the	1
farm	1
work,	1
and	1
were	1
eager	1
to	1
make	1
wealth	1
fast,	1
through	1
adventure.	1
When	1
the	1
farmer	1
was	1
old,	1
and	1
felt	1
that	1
his	1
time	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
die,	1
he	1
called	1
the	1
three	1
sons	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
said,	1
"My	1
sons,	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
pot	1
of	1
gold	1
hidden	1
in	1
the	1
olive	1
orchard.	1
Dig	1
for	1
it,	1
if	1
you	1
wish	1
it."	1
The	1
sons	1
tried	1
to	1
get	1
him	1
to	1
tell	1
them	1
in	1
what	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
orchard	1
the	1
gold	1
was	1
hidden;	1
but	1
he	1
would	1
tell	1
them	1
nothing	1
more.	1
After	1
the	1
farmer	1
was	1
dead,	1
the	1
sons	1
went	1
to	1
work	1
to	1
find	1
the	1
pot	1
of	1
gold;	1
since	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
where	1
the	1
hiding-place	1
was,	1
they	1
agreed	1
to	1
begin	1
in	1
a	1
line,	1
at	1
one	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
orchard,	1
and	1
to	1
dig	1
until	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
should	1
find	1
the	1
money.	1
They	1
dug	1
until	1
they	1
had	1
turned	1
up	1
the	1
soil	1
from	1
one	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
orchard	1
to	1
the	1
other,	1
round	1
the	1
tree-roots	1
and	1
between	1
them.	1
But	1
no	1
pot	1
of	1
gold	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
found.	1
It	1
seemed	1
as	1
if	1
some	1
one	1
must	1
have	1
stolen	1
it,	1
or	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
farmer	1
had	1
been	1
wandering	1
in	1
his	1
wits.	1
The	1
three	1
sons	1
were	1
bitterly	1
disappointed	1
to	1
have	1
all	1
their	1
work	1
for	1
nothing.	1
The	1
next	1
olive	1
season,	1
the	1
olive	1
trees	1
in	1
the	1
orchard	1
bore	1
more	1
fruit	1
than	1
they	1
had	1
ever	1
given	1
before;	1
the	1
fine	1
cultivating	1
they	1
had	1
had	1
from	1
the	1
digging	1
brought	1
so	1
much	1
fruit,	1
and	1
of	1
so	1
fine	1
a	1
quality,	1
that	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
sold	1
it	1
gave	1
the	1
sons	1
a	1
whole	1
pot	1
of	1
gold!	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
how	1
much	1
money	1
had	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
orchard,	1
they	1
suddenly	1
understood	1
what	1
the	1
wise	1
father	1
had	1
meant	1
when	1
he	1
said,	1
"There	1
is	1
gold	1
hidden	1
in	1
the	1
orchard;	1
dig	1
for	1
it."	1
MARGARET	1
OF	1
NEW	1
ORLEANS	1
If	1
you	1
ever	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
beautiful	1
city	1
of	1
New	1
Orleans,	1
somebody	1
will	1
be	1
sure	1
to	1
take	1
you	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
old	1
business	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
where	1
there	1
are	1
banks	1
and	1
shops	1
and	1
hotels,	1
and	1
show	1
you	1
a	1
statue	1
which	1
stands	1
in	1
a	1
little	1
square	1
there.	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
statue	1
of	1
a	1
woman,	1
sitting	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
chair,	1
with	1
her	1
arms	1
around	1
a	1
child,	1
who	1
leans	1
against	1
her.	1
The	1
woman	1
is	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
pretty:	1
she	1
wears	1
thick,	1
common	1
shoes,	1
a	1
plain	1
dress,	1
with	1
a	1
little	1
shawl,	1
and	1
a	1
sun-bonnet;	1
she	1
is	1
stout	1
and	1
short,	1
and	1
her	1
face	1
is	1
a	1
square-chinned	1
Irish	1
face;	1
but	1
her	1
eyes	1
look	1
at	1
you	1
like	1
your	1
mother's.	1
Now	1
there	1
is	1
something	1
very	1
surprising	1
about	1
this	1
statue:	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
one	1
that	1
was	1
ever	1
made	1
in	1
America	1
in	1
honour	1
of	1
a	1
woman.	1
Even	1
in	1
Europe	1
there	1
are	1
not	1
many	1
monuments	1
to	1
women,	1
and	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
few	1
are	1
to	1
great	1
queens	1
or	1
princesses,	1
very	1
beautiful	1
and	1
very	1
richly	1
dressed.	1
You	1
see,	1
this	1
statue	1
in	1
New	1
Orleans	1
is	1
not	1
quite	1
like	1
anything	1
else.	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
statue	1
of	1
a	1
woman	1
named	1
Margaret.	1
Her	1
whole	1
name	1
was	1
Margaret	1
Haughery,	1
but	1
no	1
one	1
in	1
New	1
Orleans	1
remembers	1
her	1
by	1
it,	1
any	1
more	1
than	1
you	1
think	1
of	1
your	1
dearest	1
sister	1
by	1
her	1
full	1
name;	1
she	1
is	1
just	1
Margaret.	1
This	1
is	1
her	1
story,	1
and	1
it	1
tells	1
why	1
people	1
made	1
a	1
monument	1
for	1
her.	1
When	1
Margaret	1
was	1
a	1
tiny	1
baby,	1
her	1
father	1
and	1
mother	1
died,	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
adopted	1
by	1
two	1
young	1
people	1
as	1
poor	1
and	1
as	1
kind	1
as	1
her	1
own	1
parents.	1
She	1
lived	1
with	1
them	1
until	1
she	1
grew	1
up.	1
Then	1
she	1
married,	1
and	1
had	1
a	1
little	1
baby	1
of	1
her	1
own.	1
But	1
very	1
soon	1
her	1
husband	1
died,	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
baby	1
died,	1
too,	1
and	1
Margaret	1
was	1
all	1
alone	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
She	1
was	1
poor,	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
strong,	1
and	1
knew	1
how	1
to	1
work.	1
All	1
day,	1
from	1
morning	1
until	1
evening,	1
she	1
ironed	1
clothes	1
in	1
a	1
laundry.	1
And	1
every	1
day,	1
as	1
she	1
worked	1
by	1
the	1
window,	1
she	1
saw	1
the	1
little	1
motherless	1
children	1
from	1
the	1
orphan	1
asylum,	1
near	1
by,	1
working	1
and	1
playing	1
about.	1
After	1
a	1
while,	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
great	1
sickness	1
upon	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
so	1
many	1
mothers	1
and	1
fathers	1
died	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
more	1
orphans	1
than	1
the	1
asylum	1
could	1
possibly	1
take	1
care	1
of.	1
They	1
needed	1
a	1
good	1
friend,	1
now.	1
You	1
would	1
hardly	1
think,	1
would	1
you,	1
that	1
a	1
poor	1
woman	1
who	1
worked	1
in	1
a	1
laundry	1
could	1
be	1
much	1
of	1
a	1
friend	1
to	1
them?	1
But	1
Margaret	1
was.	1
She	1
went	1
straight	1
to	1
the	1
kind	1
Sisters	1
who	1
had	1
the	1
asylum	1
and	1
told	1
them	1
she	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
give	1
them	1
part	1
of	1
her	1
wages	1
and	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
work	1
for	1
them,	1
besides.	1
Pretty	1
soon	1
she	1
had	1
worked	1
so	1
hard	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
some	1
money	1
saved	1
from	1
her	1
wages.	1
With	1
this,	1
she	1
bought	1
two	1
cows	1
and	1
a	1
little	1
delivery	1
cart.	1
Then	1
she	1
carried	1
her	1
milk	1
to	1
her	1
customers	1
in	1
the	1
little	1
cart	1
every	1
morning;	1
and	1
as	1
she	1
went,	1
she	1
begged	1
the	1
pieces	1
of	1
food	1
left	1
over	1
from	1
the	1
hotels	1
and	1
rich	1
houses,	1
and	1
brought	1
it	1
back	1
in	1
the	1
cart	1
to	1
the	1
hungry	1
children	1
in	1
the	1
asylum.	1
In	1
the	1
very	1
hardest	1
times	1
that	1
was	1
often	1
all	1
the	1
food	1
the	1
poor	1
children	1
had.	1
A	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
money	1
Margaret	1
earned	1
went	1
every	1
week	1
to	1
the	1
asylum,	1
and	1
after	1
a	1
few	1
years	1
that	1
was	1
made	1
very	1
much	1
larger	1
and	1
better.	1
Margaret	1
was	1
so	1
careful	1
and	1
so	1
good	1
at	1
business	1
that,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
her	1
giving,	1
she	1
bought	1
more	1
cows	1
and	1
earned	1
more	1
money.	1
With	1
this,	1
she	1
built	1
a	1
home	1
for	1
orphan	1
babies;	1
she	1
called	1
it	1
her	1
baby	1
house.	1
After	1
a	1
time,	1
Margaret	1
had	1
a	1
chance	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
bakery,	1
and	1
then	1
she	1
became	1
a	1
bread-woman	1
instead	1
of	1
a	1
milk-woman.	1
She	1
carried	1
the	1
bread	1
just	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
carried	1
the	1
milk,	1
in	1
her	1
cart.	1
And	1
still	1
she	1
kept	1
giving	1
money	1
to	1
the	1
asylum.	1
Then	1
the	1
great	1
war	1
came,	1
the	1
Civil	1
War.	1
In	1
all	1
the	1
trouble	1
and	1
sickness	1
and	1
fear	1
of	1
that	1
time,	1
Margaret	1
drove	1
her	1
cart	1
of	1
bread;	1
and	1
somehow	1
she	1
had	1
always	1
enough	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
starving	1
soldiers,	1
and	1
for	1
her	1
babies,	1
beside	1
what	1
she	1
sold.	1
And	1
despite	1
all	1
this,	1
she	1
earned	1
enough	1
so	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
war	1
was	1
over	1
she	1
built	1
a	1
big	1
steam	1
factory	1
for	1
her	1
bread.	1
By	1
this	1
time	1
everybody	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
knew	1
her.	1
The	1
children	1
all	1
over	1
the	1
city	1
loved	1
her;	1
the	1
business	1
men	1
were	1
proud	1
of	1
her;	1
the	1
poor	1
people	1
all	1
came	1
to	1
her	1
for	1
advice.	1
She	1
used	1
to	1
sit	1
at	1
the	1
open	1
door	1
of	1
her	1
office,	1
in	1
a	1
calico	1
gown	1
and	1
a	1
little	1
shawl,	1
and	1
give	1
a	1
good	1
word	1
to	1
everybody,	1
rich	1
or	1
poor.	1
Then,	1
by	1
and	1
by,	1
one	1
day,	1
Margaret	1
died.	1
And	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
time	1
to	1
read	1
her	1
will,	1
the	1
people	1
found	1
that,	1
with	1
all	1
her	1
giving,	1
she	1
had	1
still	1
saved	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
money,	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
left	1
every	1
penny	1
of	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
different	1
orphan	1
asylums	1
of	1
the	1
city,--each	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
was	1
given	1
something.	1
Whether	1
they	1
were	1
for	1
white	1
children	1
or	1
black,	1
for	1
Jews,	1
Catholics,	1
or	1
Protestants,	1
made	1
no	1
difference;	1
for	1
Margaret	1
always	1
said,	1
"They	1
are	1
all	1
orphans	1
alike."	1
And	1
just	1
think,	1
dears,	1
that	1
splendid,	1
wise	1
will	1
was	1
signed	1
with	1
a	1
cross	1
instead	1
of	1
a	1
name,	1
for	1
Margaret	1
had	1
never	1
learned	1
to	1
read	1
or	1
write!	1
When	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
New	1
Orleans	1
knew	1
that	1
Margaret	1
was	1
dead,	1
they	1
said,	1
"She	1
was	1
a	1
mother	1
to	1
the	1
motherless;	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
friend	1
to	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
no	1
friends;	1
she	1
had	1
wisdom	1
greater	1
than	1
schools	1
can	1
teach;	1
we	1
will	1
not	1
let	1
her	1
memory	1
go	1
from	1
us."	1
So	1
they	1
made	1
a	1
statue	1
of	1
her,	1
just	1
as	1
she	1
used	1
to	1
look,	1
sitting	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
office	1
door,	1
or	1
driving	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
little	1
cart.	1
And	1
there	1
it	1
stands	1
to-day,	1
in	1
memory	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
love	1
and	1
the	1
great	1
power	1
of	1
plain	1
Margaret	1
Haughery,	1
of	1
New	1
Orleans.	1
THE	1
DAGDA'S	1
HARP	1
You	1
know,	1
dears,	1
in	1
the	1
old	1
countries	1
there	1
are	1
many	1
fine	1
stories	1
about	1
things	1
which	1
happened	1
so	1
very	1
long	1
ago	1
that	1
nobody	1
knows	1
exactly	1
how	1
much	1
of	1
them	1
is	1
true.	1
Ireland	1
is	1
like	1
that.	1
It	1
is	1
so	1
old	1
that	1
even	1
as	1
long	1
ago	1
as	1
four	1
thousand	1
years	1
it	1
had	1
people	1
who	1
dug	1
in	1
the	1
mines,	1
and	1
knew	1
how	1
to	1
weave	1
cloth	1
and	1
to	1
make	1
beautiful	1
ornaments	1
out	1
of	1
gold,	1
and	1
who	1
could	1
fight	1
and	1
make	1
laws;	1
but	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
just	1
where	1
they	1
came	1
from,	1
nor	1
exactly	1
how	1
they	1
lived.	1
These	1
people	1
left	1
us	1
some	1
splendid	1
stories	1
about	1
their	1
kings,	1
their	1
fights,	1
and	1
their	1
beautiful	1
women;	1
but	1
it	1
all	1
happened	1
such	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
ago	1
that	1
the	1
stories	1
are	1
mixtures	1
of	1
things	1
that	1
really	1
happened	1
and	1
what	1
people	1
said	1
about	1
them,	1
and	1
we	1
don't	1
know	1
just	1
which	1
is	1
which.	1
The	1
stories	1
are	1
called	1
_legends_.	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
prettiest	1
legends	1
is	1
the	1
story	1
I	1
am	1
going	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
about	1
the	1
Dagda's	1
harp.	1
It	1
is	1
said	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
two	1
quite	1
different	1
kinds	1
of	1
people	1
in	1
Ireland:	1
one	1
set	1
of	1
people	1
with	1
long	1
dark	1
hair	1
and	1
dark	1
eyes,	1
called	1
Fomorians--they	1
carried	1
long	1
slender	1
spears	1
made	1
of	1
golden	1
bronze	1
when	1
they	1
fought--and	1
another	1
race	1
of	1
people	1
who	1
were	1
golden-haired	1
and	1
blue-eyed,	1
and	1
who	1
carried	1
short,	1
blunt,	1
heavy	1
spears	1
of	1
dull	1
metal.	1
The	1
golden-haired	1
people	1
had	1
a	1
great	1
chieftain	1
who	1
was	1
also	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
high	1
priest,	1
who	1
was	1
called	1
the	1
Dagda.	1
And	1
this	1
Dagda	1
had	1
a	1
wonderful	1
magic	1
harp.	1
The	1
harp	1
was	1
beautiful	1
to	1
look	1
upon,	1
mighty	1
in	1
size,	1
made	1
of	1
rare	1
wood,	1
and	1
ornamented	1
with	1
gold	1
and	1
jewels;	1
and	1
it	1
had	1
wonderful	1
music	1
in	1
its	1
strings,	1
which	1
only	1
the	1
Dagda	1
could	1
call	1
out.	1
When	1
the	1
men	1
were	1
going	1
out	1
to	1
battle,	1
the	1
Dagda	1
would	1
set	1
up	1
his	1
magic	1
harp	1
and	1
sweep	1
his	1
hand	1
across	1
the	1
strings,	1
and	1
a	1
war	1
song	1
would	1
ring	1
out	1
which	1
would	1
make	1
every	1
warrior	1
buckle	1
on	1
his	1
armour,	1
brace	1
his	1
knees,	1
and	1
shout,	1
"Forth	1
to	1
the	1
fight!"	1
Then,	1
when	1
the	1
men	1
came	1
back	1
from	1
the	1
battle,	1
weary	1
and	1
wounded,	1
the	1
Dagda	1
would	1
take	1
his	1
harp	1
and	1
strike	1
a	1
few	1
chords,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
magic	1
music	1
stole	1
out	1
upon	1
the	1
air,	1
every	1
man	1
forgot	1
his	1
weariness	1
and	1
the	1
smart	1
of	1
his	1
wounds,	1
and	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
honour	1
he	1
had	1
won,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
comrade	1
who	1
had	1
died	1
beside	1
him,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
safety	1
of	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
children.	1
Then	1
the	1
song	1
would	1
swell	1
out	1
louder,	1
and	1
every	1
warrior	1
would	1
remember	1
only	1
the	1
glory	1
he	1
had	1
helped	1
win	1
for	1
the	1
king;	1
and	1
each	1
man	1
would	1
rise	1
at	1
the	1
great	1
table,	1
his	1
cup	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
shout	1
"Long	1
live	1
the	1
King!"	1
There	1
came	1
a	1
time	1
when	1
the	1
Fomorians	1
and	1
the	1
golden-haired	1
men	1
were	1
at	1
war;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
battle,	1
while	1
the	1
Dagda's	1
hall	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
well	1
guarded	1
as	1
usual,	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
chieftains	1
of	1
the	1
Fomorians	1
stole	1
the	1
great	1
harp	1
from	1
the	1
wall,	1
where	1
it	1
hung,	1
and	1
fled	1
away	1
with	1
it.	1
Their	1
wives	1
and	1
children	1
and	1
some	1
few	1
of	1
their	1
soldiers	1
went	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
fled	1
fast	1
and	1
far	1
through	1
the	1
night,	1
until	1
they	1
were	1
a	1
long	1
way	1
from	1
the	1
battlefield.	1
Then	1
they	1
thought	1
they	1
were	1
safe,	1
and	1
they	1
turned	1
aside	1
into	1
a	1
vacant	1
castle,	1
by	1
the	1
road,	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
to	1
a	1
banquet,	1
hanging	1
the	1
stolen	1
harp	1
on	1
the	1
wall.	1
The	1
Dagda,	1
with	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
of	1
his	1
warriors,	1
had	1
followed	1
hard	1
on	1
their	1
track.	1
And	1
while	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
their	1
banqueting,	1
the	1
door	1
was	1
suddenly	1
burst	1
open,	1
and	1
the	1
Dagda	1
stood	1
there,	1
with	1
his	1
men.	1
Some	1
of	1
the	1
Fomorians	1
sprang	1
to	1
their	1
feet,	1
but	1
before	1
any	1
of	1
them	1
could	1
grasp	1
a	1
weapon,	1
the	1
Dagda	1
called	1
out	1
to	1
his	1
harp	1
on	1
the	1
wall,	1
"Come	1
to	1
me,	1
O	1
my	1
harp!"	1
The	1
great	1
harp	1
recognised	1
its	1
master's	1
voice,	1
and	1
leaped	1
from	1
the	1
wall.	1
Whirling	1
through	1
the	1
hall,	1
sweeping	1
aside	1
and	1
killing	1
the	1
men	1
who	1
got	1
in	1
its	1
way,	1
it	1
sprang	1
to	1
its	1
master's	1
hand.	1
And	1
the	1
Dagda	1
took	1
his	1
harp	1
and	1
swept	1
his	1
hand	1
across	1
the	1
strings	1
in	1
three	1
great,	1
solemn	1
chords.	1
The	1
harp	1
answered	1
with	1
the	1
magic	1
Music	1
of	1
Tears.	1
As	1
the	1
wailing	1
harmony	1
smote	1
upon	1
the	1
air,	1
the	1
women	1
of	1
the	1
Fomorians	1
bowed	1
their	1
heads	1
and	1
wept	1
bitterly,	1
the	1
strong	1
men	1
turned	1
their	1
faces	1
aside,	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
children	1
sobbed.	1
Again	1
the	1
Dagda	1
touched	1
the	1
strings,	1
and	1
this	1
time	1
the	1
magic	1
Music	1
of	1
Mirth	1
leaped	1
from	1
the	1
harp.	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
that	1
Music	1
of	1
Mirth,	1
the	1
young	1
warriors	1
of	1
the	1
Fomorians	1
began	1
to	1
laugh;	1
they	1
laughed	1
till	1
the	1
cups	1
fell	1
from	1
their	1
grasp,	1
and	1
the	1
spears	1
dropped	1
from	1
their	1
hands,	1
while	1
the	1
wine	1
flowed	1
from	1
the	1
broken	1
bowls;	1
they	1
laughed	1
until	1
their	1
limbs	1
were	1
helpless	1
with	1
excess	1
of	1
glee.	1
Once	1
more	1
the	1
Dagda	1
touched	1
his	1
harp,	1
but	1
very,	1
very	1
softly.	1
And	1
now	1
a	1
music	1
stole	1
forth	1
as	1
soft	1
as	1
dreams,	1
and	1
as	1
sweet	1
as	1
joy:	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
magic	1
Music	1
of	1
Sleep.	1
When	1
they	1
heard	1
that,	1
gently,	1
gently,	1
the	1
Fomorian	1
women	1
bowed	1
their	1
heads	1
in	1
slumber;	1
the	1
little	1
children	1
crept	1
to	1
their	1
mothers'	1
laps;	1
the	1
old	1
men	1
nodded;	1
and	1
the	1
young	1
warriors	1
drooped	1
in	1
their	1
seats	1
and	1
closed	1
their	1
eyes:	1
one	1
after	1
another	1
all	1
the	1
Fomorians	1
sank	1
into	1
sleep.	1
When	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
deep	1
in	1
slumber,	1
the	1
Dagda	1
took	1
his	1
magic	1
harp,	1
and	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
golden-haired	1
warriors	1
stole	1
softly	1
away,	1
and	1
came	1
in	1
safety	1
to	1
their	1
own	1
homes	1
again.	1
THE	1
TAILOR	1
AND	1
THE	1
THREE	1
BEASTS	1
There	1
was	1
once	1
a	1
tailor	1
in	1
Galway,	1
and	1
he	1
started	1
out	1
on	1
a	1
journey	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
king's	1
court	1
at	1
Dublin.	1
He	1
had	1
not	1
gone	1
far	1
when	1
he	1
met	1
a	1
white	1
horse,	1
and	1
he	1
saluted	1
him.	1
"God	1
save	1
you,"	1
said	1
the	1
tailor.	1
"God	1
save	1
you,"	1
said	1
the	1
horse.	1
"Where	1
are	1
you	1
going?"	1
"I	1
am	1
going	1
to	1
Dublin,"	1
said	1
the	1
tailor,	1
"to	1
build	1
a	1
court	1
for	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
lady	1
for	1
a	1
wife,	1
if	1
I	1
am	1
able	1
to	1
do	1
it."	1
For,	1
it	1
seems	1
the	1
king	1
had	1
promised	1
his	1
daughter	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
lot	1
of	1
money	1
to	1
anyone	1
who	1
should	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
build	1
up	1
his	1
court.	1
The	1
trouble	1
was,	1
that	1
three	1
giants	1
lived	1
in	1
the	1
wood	1
near	1
the	1
court,	1
and	1
every	1
night	1
they	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
wood	1
and	1
threw	1
down	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
built	1
by	1
day.	1
So	1
nobody	1
could	1
get	1
the	1
court	1
built.	1
"Would	1
you	1
make	1
me	1
a	1
hole,"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
white	1
garraun,	1
"where	1
I	1
could	1
go	1
in	1
to	1
hide	1
whenever	1
the	1
people	1
come	1
to	1
fetch	1
me	1
to	1
the	1
mill	1
or	1
the	1
kiln,	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
won't	1
see	1
me;	1
for	1
they	1
tire	1
me	1
out	1
doing	1
work	1
for	1
them?"	1
"I'll	1
do	1
that,	1
indeed,"	1
said	1
the	1
tailor,	1
"and	1
welcome."	1
He	1
brought	1
his	1
spade	1
and	1
shovel,	1
and	1
he	1
made	1
a	1
hole,	1
and	1
he	1
asked	1
the	1
old	1
white	1
horse	1
to	1
go	1
down	1
into	1
it	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
see	1
if	1
it	1
would	1
fit	1
him.	1
The	1
white	1
horse	1
went	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
hole,	1
but	1
when	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
come	1
up	1
again,	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
able.	1
"Make	1
a	1
place	1
for	1
me	1
now,"	1
said	1
the	1
white	1
horse,	1
"by	1
which	1
I	1
can	1
come	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hole	1
here,	1
whenever	1
I	1
am	1
hungry."	1
"I	1
will	1
not,"	1
said	1
the	1
tailor;	1
"remain	1
where	1
you	1
are	1
until	1
I	1
come	1
back,	1
and	1
I'll	1
lift	1
you	1
up."	1
The	1
tailor	1
went	1
forward	1
next	1
day,	1
and	1
the	1
fox	1
met	1
him.	1
"God	1
save	1
you,"	1
said	1
the	1
fox.	1
"God	1
save	1
you,"	1
said	1
the	1
tailor.	1
"Where	1
are	1
you	1
going?"	1
said	1
the	1
fox.	1
"I'm	1
going	1
to	1
Dublin,	1
to	1
try	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
court	1
for	1
the	1
king."	1
"Would	1
you	1
make	1
a	1
place	1
for	1
me	1
where	1
I	1
can	1
hide?"	1
said	1
the	1
fox.	1
"The	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
foxes	1
are	1
always	1
beating	1
me,	1
and	1
they	1
will	1
not	1
allow	1
me	1
to	1
eat	1
anything	1
with	1
them."	1
"I'll	1
do	1
that	1
for	1
you,"	1
said	1
the	1
tailor.	1
He	1
took	1
his	1
axe	1
and	1
his	1
saw,	1
and	1
he	1
made	1
a	1
thing	1
like	1
a	1
crate,	1
and	1
he	1
told	1
the	1
fox	1
to	1
get	1
into	1
it	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
see	1
whether	1
it	1
would	1
fit	1
him.	1
The	1
fox	1
went	1
into	1
it,	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
tailor	1
had	1
him	1
down,	1
he	1
shut	1
him	1
in.	1
When	1
the	1
fox	1
was	1
satisfied	1
at	1
last	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
nice	1
place	1
of	1
it	1
within,	1
he	1
asked	1
the	1
tailor	1
to	1
let	1
him	1
out,	1
and	1
the	1
tailor	1
answered	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not.	1
"Wait	1
there	1
until	1
I	1
come	1
back	1
again,"	1
said	1
he.	1
The	1
tailor	1
went	1
forward	1
the	1
next	1
day,	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
walked	1
very	1
far	1
when	1
he	1
met	1
a	1
lion;	1
and	1
the	1
lion	1
greeted	1
him.	1
"God	1
save	1
you,"	1
said	1
the	1
lion.	1
"God	1
save	1
you,"	1
said	1
the	1
tailor.	1
"Where	1
are	1
you	1
going?"	1
said	1
the	1
lion.	1
"I'm	1
going	1
to	1
Dublin	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
court	1
for	1
the	1
king	1
if	1
I	1
am	1
able	1
to	1
make	1
it,"	1
said	1
the	1
tailor.	1
"If	1
you	1
were	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
plough	1
for	1
me,"	1
said	1
the	1
lion,	1
"I	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
lions	1
could	1
be	1
ploughing	1
and	1
harrowing	1
until	1
we'd	1
have	1
a	1
bit	1
to	1
eat	1
in	1
the	1
harvest."	1
"I'll	1
do	1
that	1
for	1
you,"	1
said	1
the	1
tailor.	1
He	1
brought	1
his	1
axe	1
and	1
his	1
saw,	1
and	1
he	1
made	1
a	1
plough.	1
When	1
the	1
plough	1
was	1
made	1
he	1
put	1
a	1
hole	1
in	1
the	1
beam	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
got	1
the	1
lion	1
to	1
go	1
in	1
under	1
the	1
plough	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
see	1
if	1
he	1
was	1
any	1
good	1
as	1
a	1
ploughman.	1
He	1
placed	1
the	1
lion's	1
tail	1
in	1
the	1
hole	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
for	1
it,	1
and	1
then	1
clapped	1
in	1
a	1
peg,	1
and	1
the	1
lion	1
was	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
draw	1
out	1
his	1
tail	1
again.	1
"Loose	1
me	1
now,"	1
said	1
the	1
lion,	1
"and	1
we'll	1
fix	1
ourselves	1
and	1
go	1
ploughing."	1
The	1
tailor	1
said	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
loose	1
him	1
until	1
he	1
came	1
back	1
himself.	1
He	1
left	1
him	1
there	1
then,	1
and	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
Dublin.	1
When	1
he	1
arrived,	1
he	1
engaged	1
workmen	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
build	1
the	1
court.	1
At	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
workmen	1
put	1
a	1
great	1
stone	1
on	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
work.	1
When	1
the	1
great	1
stone	1
was	1
raised	1
up,	1
the	1
tailor	1
put	1
some	1
sort	1
of	1
contrivance	1
under	1
it,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
throw	1
it	1
down	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
giants	1
came	1
near	1
to	1
it.	1
The	1
workpeople	1
then	1
went	1
home,	1
and	1
the	1
tailor	1
went	1
in	1
hiding	1
behind	1
the	1
big	1
stone.	1
When	1
the	1
darkness	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
was	1
come,	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
three	1
giants	1
arriving,	1
and	1
they	1
began	1
throwing	1
down	1
the	1
court	1
until	1
they	1
arrived	1
at	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
the	1
tailor	1
was	1
in	1
hiding	1
up	1
above,	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
struck	1
a	1
blow	1
with	1
his	1
sledge	1
on	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
he	1
was.	1
The	1
tailor	1
threw	1
down	1
the	1
stone,	1
and	1
it	1
fell	1
on	1
him	1
and	1
killed	1
him.	1
The	1
other	1
two	1
went	1
home	1
then	1
and	1
left	1
all	1
of	1
the	1
court	1
that	1
was	1
remaining	1
without	1
throwing	1
it	1
down,	1
since	1
their	1
companion	1
was	1
dead.	1
The	1
workmen	1
came	1
again	1
the	1
next	1
day,	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
working	1
until	1
night,	1
and	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
going	1
home	1
the	1
tailor	1
told	1
them	1
to	1
put	1
up	1
the	1
big	1
stone	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
work,	1
as	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
night	1
before.	1
They	1
did	1
that	1
for	1
him,	1
went	1
home,	1
and	1
the	1
tailor	1
went	1
in	1
hiding	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
the	1
evening	1
before.	1
When	1
the	1
people	1
had	1
all	1
gone	1
to	1
rest,	1
the	1
two	1
giants	1
came,	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
throwing	1
down	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
before	1
them,	1
but	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
began,	1
the	1
tailor	1
commenced	1
manoeuvring	1
until	1
he	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
throw	1
down	1
the	1
great	1
stone,	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
fell	1
upon	1
the	1
skull	1
of	1
the	1
giant	1
that	1
was	1
under	1
him,	1
and	1
it	1
killed	1
him.	1
After	1
this	1
there	1
was	1
only	1
the	1
one	1
giant	1
left,	1
and	1
he	1
never	1
came	1
again	1
until	1
the	1
court	1
was	1
finished.	1
Then	1
when	1
the	1
work	1
was	1
over,	1
the	1
tailor	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
his	1
money,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
court	1
finished;	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
give	1
him	1
any	1
wife	1
until	1
he	1
had	1
killed	1
the	1
other	1
giant,	1
for	1
he	1
said	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
by	1
his	1
strength	1
he	1
had	1
killed	1
the	1
two	1
giants	1
before,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
give	1
him	1
nothing	1
now	1
until	1
he	1
killed	1
the	1
other	1
one	1
for	1
him.	1
Then	1
the	1
tailor	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
kill	1
the	1
other	1
giant	1
for	1
him,	1
and	1
welcome;	1
that	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
no	1
delay	1
at	1
all	1
about	1
that.	1
The	1
tailor	1
went	1
then	1
till	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
the	1
other	1
giant	1
was,	1
and	1
asked	1
did	1
he	1
want	1
a	1
servant-boy.	1
The	1
giant	1
said	1
he	1
did	1
want	1
one,	1
if	1
he	1
could	1
get	1
one	1
who	1
would	1
do	1
everything	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
do	1
himself.	1
"Anything	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
do,	1
I	1
will	1
do,"	1
said	1
the	1
tailor.	1
They	1
went	1
to	1
their	1
dinner	1
then,	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
eaten	1
it,	1
the	1
giant	1
asked	1
the	1
tailor	1
"would	1
he	1
dare	1
to	1
swallow	1
as	1
much	1
boiling	1
broth	1
as	1
himself."	1
The	1
tailor	1
said,	1
"I	1
will	1
certainly	1
do	1
that,	1
but	1
you	1
must	1
give	1
me	1
an	1
hour	1
before	1
we	1
commence."	1
The	1
tailor	1
went	1
out	1
then,	1
and	1
he	1
got	1
a	1
sheepskin,	1
which	1
he	1
sewed	1
up	1
until	1
he	1
made	1
a	1
bag	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
he	1
slipped	1
it	1
down	1
under	1
his	1
coat.	1
He	1
came	1
in	1
then	1
and	1
told	1
the	1
giant	1
first	1
to	1
drink	1
a	1
gallon	1
of	1
the	1
broth	1
himself.	1
The	1
giant	1
drank	1
that	1
up	1
while	1
it	1
was	1
boiling.	1
"I'll	1
do	1
that,"	1
said	1
the	1
tailor.	1
He	1
went	1
on	1
until	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
poured	1
into	1
the	1
skin,	1
and	1
the	1
giant	1
thought	1
he	1
had	1
drunk	1
it.	1
The	1
giant	1
drank	1
another	1
gallon	1
then,	1
and	1
the	1
tailor	1
let	1
another	1
gallon	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
skin,	1
but	1
the	1
giant	1
thought	1
he	1
was	1
drinking	1
it.	1
"I'll	1
do	1
a	1
thing	1
now	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
dare	1
to	1
do,"	1
said	1
the	1
tailor.	1
"You	1
will	1
not,"	1
said	1
the	1
giant.	1
"What	1
is	1
it	1
you	1
would	1
do?"	1
"Make	1
a	1
hole	1
and	1
let	1
out	1
the	1
broth	1
again,"	1
said	1
the	1
tailor.	1
"Do	1
it	1
yourself	1
first,"	1
said	1
the	1
giant.	1
The	1
tailor	1
gave	1
a	1
prod	1
of	1
the	1
knife,	1
and	1
he	1
let	1
the	1
broth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
skin.	1
"Now	1
you	1
do	1
that,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"I	1
will,"	1
said	1
the	1
giant,	1
giving	1
such	1
a	1
prod	1
of	1
the	1
knife	1
into	1
his	1
own	1
stomach	1
that	1
he	1
killed	1
himself.	1
That	1
is	1
the	1
way	1
the	1
tailor	1
killed	1
the	1
third	1
giant.	1
He	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
then,	1
and	1
desired	1
him	1
to	1
send	1
him	1
out	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
his	1
money,	1
saying	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
throw	1
down	1
the	1
court	1
again	1
if	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
do	1
so	1
immediately.	1
They	1
were	1
afraid	1
then	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
throw	1
down	1
the	1
court,	1
and	1
they	1
sent	1
the	1
wife	1
to	1
him.	1
When	1
the	1
tailor	1
was	1
a	1
day	1
gone,	1
himself	1
and	1
his	1
wife,	1
they	1
repented	1
and	1
followed	1
him	1
to	1
take	1
his	1
wife	1
away	1
from	1
him	1
again.	1
The	1
people	1
who	1
went	1
after	1
him	1
followed	1
him	1
until	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
the	1
lion	1
was,	1
and	1
the	1
lion	1
said	1
to	1
them,	1
"The	1
tailor	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
were	1
here	1
yesterday.	1
I	1
saw	1
them	1
going	1
by,	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
loose	1
me	1
now,	1
I	1
am	1
swifter	1
than	1
you,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
follow	1
them	1
until	1
I	1
overtake	1
them."	1
When	1
they	1
heard	1
that,	1
they	1
released	1
the	1
lion.	1
The	1
lion	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Dublin	1
went	1
on,	1
and	1
pursued	1
the	1
tailor,	1
until	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
the	1
fox	1
was,	1
and	1
the	1
fox	1
greeted	1
them,	1
and	1
said,	1
"The	1
tailor	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
were	1
here	1
this	1
morning,	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
loose	1
me,	1
I	1
am	1
swifter	1
than	1
you,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
follow	1
them,	1
and	1
overtake	1
them."	1
They	1
therefore	1
set	1
the	1
fox	1
free.	1
The	1
lion	1
and	1
the	1
fox	1
and	1
the	1
army	1
of	1
Dublin	1
went	1
on	1
then,	1
trying	1
to	1
catch	1
the	1
tailor,	1
and	1
they	1
kept	1
going	1
until	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
the	1
old	1
white	1
garraun	1
was,	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
white	1
garraun	1
told	1
them	1
that	1
the	1
tailor	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
were	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
"Loose	1
me,"	1
said	1
he;	1
"I	1
am	1
swifter	1
than	1
you,	1
and	1
I'll	1
overtake	1
them."	1
They	1
released	1
the	1
old	1
white	1
garraun	1
then,	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
white	1
garraun,	1
the	1
fox,	1
the	1
lion,	1
and	1
the	1
army	1
of	1
Dublin	1
pursued	1
the	1
tailor	1
and	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
long	1
before	1
they	1
came	1
up	1
with	1
them.	1
When	1
the	1
tailor	1
saw	1
them	1
coming,	1
he	1
got	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
coach	1
with	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
he	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
ground.	1
When	1
the	1
old	1
white	1
garraun	1
saw	1
the	1
tailor	1
sitting	1
on	1
the	1
ground,	1
he	1
said,	1
"That's	1
the	1
position	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
when	1
he	1
made	1
the	1
hole	1
for	1
me,	1
that	1
I	1
couldn't	1
get	1
out	1
of,	1
when	1
I	1
went	1
down	1
into	1
it.	1
I'll	1
go	1
no	1
nearer	1
to	1
him."	1
"No!"	1
said	1
the	1
fox,	1
"but	1
that's	1
the	1
way	1
he	1
was	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
making	1
the	1
thing	1
for	1
me,	1
and	1
I'll	1
go	1
no	1
nearer	1
to	1
him."	1
"No!"	1
says	1
the	1
lion,	1
"but	1
that's	1
the	1
very	1
way	1
he	1
had,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
making	1
the	1
plough	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
caught	1
in.	1
I'll	1
go	1
no	1
nearer	1
to	1
him."	1
They	1
all	1
left	1
him	1
then	1
and	1
returned.	1
The	1
tailor	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
came	1
home	1
to	1
Galway.	1
HOW	1
THE	1
SEA	1
BECAME	1
SALT	1
This	1
story	1
was	1
told	1
long	1
ago	1
by	1
our	1
Northern	1
forefathers	1
who	1
brought	1
it	1
with	1
them	1
in	1
their	1
dragon	1
ships	1
when	1
they	1
crossed	1
the	1
North	1
Sea	1
to	1
settle	1
in	1
England.	1
In	1
those	1
days	1
men	1
were	1
apt	1
to	1
invent	1
stories	1
to	1
account	1
for	1
things	1
about	1
them	1
which	1
seemed	1
peculiar,	1
and	1
loving	1
the	1
sea	1
as	1
they	1
did,	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
strange	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
remarked	1
the	1
peculiarity	1
of	1
the	1
ocean	1
water	1
and	1
had	1
found	1
a	1
reason	1
why	1
it	1
is	1
so	1
different	1
from	1
the	1
water	1
in	1
the	1
rivers	1
and	1
steams.	1
This	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
only	1
story	1
that	1
has	1
come	1
down	1
to	1
tell	1
us	1
how	1
people	1
of	1
old	1
accounted	1
for	1
the	1
sea	1
being	1
salt.	1
There	1
are	1
many	1
such	1
stories,	1
each	1
different	1
from	1
the	1
other,	1
all	1
showing	1
that	1
the	1
same	1
childlike	1
spirit	1
of	1
inquiry	1
was	1
at	1
work	1
in	1
different	1
places,	1
striving	1
to	1
find	1
an	1
answer	1
to	1
this	1
riddle	1
of	1
nature.	1
*	1
*	1
*	1
*	1
*	1
There	1
sprang	1
from	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Odin	1
a	1
race	1
of	1
men	1
who	1
became	1
mighty	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
these,	1
named	1
Frode,	1
ruled	1
over	1
the	1
lands	1
that	1
are	1
called	1
Denmark.	1
Now	1
about	1
this	1
time	1
were	1
found	1
in	1
Denmark	1
two	1
great	1
millstones,	1
so	1
large	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
had	1
the	1
strength	1
to	1
turn	1
them.	1
So	1
Frode	1
sent	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
wise	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
bade	1
them	1
examine	1
the	1
stones	1
and	1
tell	1
him	1
of	1
what	1
use	1
they	1
were,	1
since	1
no	1
one	1
could	1
grind	1
with	1
them.	1
And	1
after	1
the	1
wise	1
men	1
had	1
looked	1
closely	1
at	1
them	1
and	1
read	1
the	1
magic	1
letters	1
which	1
were	1
cut	1
upon	1
their	1
edge,	1
they	1
said	1
that	1
the	1
millstones	1
were	1
precious	1
indeed,	1
since	1
they	1
would	1
grind	1
out	1
of	1
nothing	1
anything	1
that	1
the	1
miller	1
might	1
wish.	1
So	1
King	1
Frode	1
sent	1
messengers	1
over	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
find	1
for	1
him	1
two	1
servants	1
who	1
would	1
be	1
strong	1
enough	1
to	1
grind	1
with	1
the	1
millstones,	1
and	1
after	1
a	1
long,	1
long	1
time	1
his	1
messengers	1
found	1
him	1
two	1
maid-servants,	1
who	1
were	1
bigger	1
and	1
stronger	1
than	1
anyone	1
in	1
Denmark	1
had	1
ever	1
seen.	1
But	1
no	1
one	1
guessed	1
that	1
these	1
were	1
really	1
Giant-Maidens	1
who	1
bore	1
a	1
grudge	1
against	1
all	1
of	1
the	1
race	1
of	1
Odin.	1
Directly	1
the	1
Giant-Maidens	1
were	1
brought	1
before	1
Frode,	1
and	1
before	1
they	1
had	1
rested	1
after	1
their	1
long	1
journey,	1
or	1
satisfied	1
their	1
hunger,	1
he	1
bade	1
them	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
mill,	1
and	1
grind	1
for	1
him	1
gold	1
and	1
peace	1
and	1
happiness.	1
"They	1
sang	1
and	1
swung	1
The	1
swift	1
mill	1
stone,	1
And	1
with	1
loud	1
voice	1
They	1
made	1
their	1
moan.	1
'We	1
grind	1
for	1
Frode	1
Wealth	1
and	1
gold	1
Abundant	1
riches	1
He	1
shall	1
behold.'"	1
Presently	1
Frode	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
mill	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
the	1
new	1
servants	1
were	1
performing	1
their	1
task	1
diligently.	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
watched	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
shadow	1
by	1
the	1
door,	1
the	1
maidens	1
stayed	1
their	1
grinding	1
for	1
a	1
while	1
to	1
rest.	1
The	1
greedy	1
man	1
could	1
not	1
bear	1
to	1
see	1
even	1
an	1
instant's	1
pause,	1
and	1
he	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
shadow,	1
and	1
bade	1
them,	1
with	1
harsh	1
words,	1
go	1
on	1
grinding,	1
and	1
cease	1
not	1
except	1
for	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
the	1
cuckoo	1
was	1
silent,	1
or	1
while	1
he	1
himself	1
sang	1
a	1
song.	1
Now	1
it	1
was	1
early	1
summer-time,	1
and	1
the	1
cuckoo	1
was	1
calling	1
all	1
the	1
day	1
and	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
night.	1
So	1
the	1
Giant-Maidens	1
waxed	1
very	1
wroth	1
with	1
King	1
Frode,	1
and	1
as	1
they	1
resumed	1
their	1
labours	1
they	1
sang	1
a	1
song	1
of	1
the	1
hardness	1
of	1
their	1
lot	1
in	1
the	1
household	1
of	1
this	1
pitiless	1
King.	1
They	1
had	1
been	1
grinding	1
out	1
wealth	1
and	1
happiness	1
and	1
peace,	1
but	1
now	1
they	1
bade	1
the	1
magic	1
stones	1
to	1
grind	1
something	1
very	1
different.	1
Presently,	1
as	1
the	1
great	1
stones	1
moved	1
round	1
and	1
round,	1
Frode,	1
who	1
still	1
stood	1
by,	1
heard	1
one	1
chant	1
in	1
a	1
low,	1
sing-song	1
voice,--	1
"I	1
see	1
a	1
fire	1
east	1
of	1
the	1
town--the	1
curlews	1
awake	1
and	1
sound	1
a	1
note	1
of	1
warning.	1
A	1
host	1
approaches	1
in	1
haste,	1
to	1
burn	1
the	1
dwelling	1
of	1
the	1
king."	1
And	1
the	1
next	1
took	1
up	1
her	1
song,--	1
"No	1
longer	1
will	1
Frode	1
sit	1
on	1
his	1
throne,	1
and	1
rule	1
over	1
rings	1
of	1
red	1
gold	1
and	1
mighty	1
millstones.	1
Now	1
must	1
we	1
grind	1
with	1
all	1
our	1
might--and,	1
behold!	1
red	1
warriors	1
come	1
forth--and	1
revenge,	1
and	1
bloodshed,	1
and	1
ruin."	1
Then	1
Frode	1
shook	1
from	1
head	1
to	1
foot	1
in	1
his	1
terror,	1
for	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
tramp	1
of	1
a	1
mighty	1
host	1
of	1
warriors	1
advancing	1
from	1
the	1
sea.	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
looked	1
for	1
a	1
way	1
of	1
escape,	1
the	1
braces	1
of	1
the	1
millstones	1
broke	1
with	1
the	1
strong	1
grinding,	1
and	1
fell	1
in	1
two.	1
And	1
the	1
whole	1
world	1
shook	1
and	1
trembled	1
with	1
the	1
mighty	1
shock	1
of	1
that	1
breaking.	1
But	1
through	1
the	1
crash	1
and	1
din	1
came	1
the	1
voices	1
of	1
the	1
Giant-Maidens,	1
loudly	1
chanting,--	1
"We	1
have	1
turned	1
the	1
stone	1
round;	1
Though	1
weary	1
the	1
maidens,	1
See	1
what	1
they	1
have	1
ground!"	1
And	1
that	1
same	1
night	1
a	1
mighty	1
sea-king	1
came	1
up	1
and	1
slew	1
Frode	1
and	1
plundered	1
his	1
city.	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
sacked	1
the	1
city,	1
the	1
sea-king	1
took	1
on	1
board	1
his	1
ship	1
the	1
two	1
Giant-Maidens,	1
and	1
with	1
them	1
the	1
broken	1
millstones.	1
And	1
he	1
bade	1
them	1
begin	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
grind	1
salt,	1
for	1
of	1
this	1
he	1
had	1
very	1
scanty	1
store.	1
So	1
they	1
ground	1
and	1
ground;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
night,	1
being	1
weary,	1
they	1
asked	1
the	1
sea-king	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
got	1
salt	1
enough.	1
But	1
the	1
sea-king	1
was	1
hard	1
of	1
heart,	1
like	1
Frode,	1
and	1
he	1
roughly	1
bade	1
them	1
go	1
on	1
grinding.	1
And	1
the	1
maidens	1
did	1
so,	1
and	1
worked	1
to	1
such	1
effect	1
that	1
within	1
a	1
short	1
time	1
the	1
millstones	1
had	1
ground	1
out	1
so	1
much	1
salt	1
that	1
the	1
weight	1
of	1
it	1
began	1
to	1
sink	1
the	1
ship.	1
Down,	1
down	1
it	1
sank,	1
ship	1
and	1
giants	1
and	1
millstones,	1
and	1
in	1
that	1
spot,	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
ocean,	1
arose	1
a	1
whirlpool,	1
from	1
whence	1
the	1
salt	1
is	1
carried	1
north	1
and	1
south,	1
east	1
and	1
west,	1
throughout	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
And	1
that	1
is	1
how	1
the	1
sea	1
became	1
salt.	1
THE	1
CASTLE	1
OF	1
FORTUNE	1
One	1
lovely	1
summer	1
morning,	1
just	1
as	1
the	1
sun	1
rose,	1
two	1
travellers	1
started	1
on	1
a	1
journey.	1
They	1
were	1
both	1
strong	1
young	1
men,	1
but	1
one	1
was	1
a	1
lazy	1
fellow	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
was	1
a	1
worker.	1
As	1
the	1
first	1
sunbeams	1
came	1
over	1
the	1
hills,	1
they	1
shone	1
on	1
a	1
great	1
castle	1
standing	1
on	1
the	1
heights,	1
as	1
far	1
away	1
as	1
the	1
eye	1
could	1
see.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
wonderful	1
and	1
beautiful	1
castle,	1
all	1
glistening	1
towers	1
that	1
gleamed	1
like	1
marble,	1
and	1
glancing	1
windows	1
that	1
shone	1
like	1
crystal.	1
The	1
two	1
young	1
men	1
looked	1
at	1
it	1
eagerly,	1
and	1
longed	1
to	1
go	1
nearer.	1
Suddenly,	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
distance,	1
something	1
like	1
a	1
great	1
butterfly,	1
of	1
white	1
and	1
gold,	1
swept	1
toward	1
them.	1
And	1
when	1
it	1
came	1
nearer,	1
they	1
saw	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
most	1
beautiful	1
lady,	1
robed	1
in	1
floating	1
garments	1
as	1
fine	1
as	1
cobwebs	1
and	1
wearing	1
on	1
her	1
head	1
a	1
crown	1
so	1
bright	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
could	1
tell	1
whether	1
it	1
was	1
of	1
diamonds	1
or	1
of	1
dew.	1
She	1
stood,	1
light	1
as	1
air,	1
on	1
a	1
great,	1
shining,	1
golden	1
ball,	1
which	1
rolled	1
along	1
with	1
her,	1
swifter	1
than	1
the	1
wind.	1
As	1
she	1
passed	1
the	1
travellers,	1
she	1
turned	1
her	1
face	1
to	1
them	1
and	1
smiled.	1
"Follow	1
me!"	1
she	1
said.	1
The	1
lazy	1
man	1
sat	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
grass	1
with	1
a	1
discontented	1
sigh.	1
"She	1
has	1
an	1
easy	1
time	1
of	1
it!"	1
he	1
said.	1
But	1
the	1
industrious	1
man	1
ran	1
after	1
the	1
lovely	1
lady	1
and	1
caught	1
the	1
hem	1
of	1
her	1
floating	1
robe	1
in	1
his	1
grasp.	1
"Who	1
are	1
you,	1
and	1
whither	1
are	1
you	1
going?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
"I	1
am	1
the	1
Fairy	1
of	1
Fortune,"	1
the	1
beautiful	1
lady	1
said,	1
"and	1
that	1
is	1
my	1
castle.	1
You	1
may	1
reach	1
it	1
to-day,	1
if	1
you	1
will;	1
there	1
is	1
time,	1
if	1
you	1
waste	1
none.	1
If	1
you	1
reach	1
it	1
before	1
the	1
last	1
stroke	1
of	1
midnight,	1
I	1
will	1
receive	1
you	1
there,	1
and	1
will	1
be	1
your	1
friend.	1
But	1
if	1
you	1
come	1
one	1
second	1
after	1
midnight,	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
too	1
late."	1
When	1
she	1
had	1
said	1
this,	1
her	1
robe	1
slipped	1
from	1
the	1
traveller's	1
hand	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
gone.	1
The	1
industrious	1
man	1
hurried	1
back	1
to	1
his	1
friend,	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
what	1
the	1
fairy	1
had	1
said.	1
"The	1
idea!"	1
said	1
the	1
lazy,	1
man,	1
and	1
he	1
laughed;	1
"of	1
course,	1
if	1
we	1
had	1
a	1
horse	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
some	1
chance,	1
but	1
_walk_	1
all	1
that	1
way?	1
No,	1
thank	1
you!"	1
"Then	1
good-bye,"	1
said	1
his	1
friend,	1
"I	1
am	1
off."	1
And	1
he	1
set	1
out,	1
down	1
the	1
road	1
toward	1
the	1
shining	1
castle,	1
with	1
a	1
good	1
steady	1
stride,	1
his	1
eyes	1
straight	1
ahead.	1
The	1
lazy	1
man	1
lay	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
soft	1
grass,	1
and	1
looked	1
rather	1
wistfully	1
at	1
the	1
far-away	1
towers.	1
"If	1
only	1
I	1
had	1
a	1
good	1
horse!"	1
he	1
sighed.	1
Just	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
he	1
felt	1
something	1
warm	1
nosing	1
about	1
at	1
his	1
shoulder,	1
and	1
heard	1
a	1
little	1
whinny.	1
He	1
turned	1
round,	1
and	1
there	1
stood	1
a	1
little	1
horse!	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
dainty	1
creature,	1
gentle-looking,	1
and	1
finely	1
built,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
saddled	1
and	1
bridled.	1
"Hello!"	1
said	1
the	1
lazy	1
man.	1
"Luck	1
often	1
comes	1
when	1
one	1
isn't	1
looking	1
for	1
it!"	1
And	1
in	1
an	1
instant	1
he	1
had	1
leaped	1
on	1
the	1
horse,	1
and	1
headed	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
castle	1
of	1
fortune.	1
The	1
little	1
horse	1
started	1
at	1
a	1
fine	1
pace,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
few	1
minutes	1
they	1
overtook	1
the	1
other	1
traveller,	1
plodding	1
along	1
on	1
foot.	1
"How	1
do	1
you	1
like	1
shank's	1
pony?"	1
laughed	1
the	1
lazy	1
man,	1
as	1
he	1
passed	1
his	1
friend.	1
The	1
industrious	1
man	1
only	1
nodded,	1
and	1
kept	1
on	1
with	1
his	1
steady	1
stride,	1
eyes	1
straight	1
ahead.	1
The	1
horse	1
kept	1
his	1
good	1
pace,	1
and	1
by	1
noon	1
the	1
towers	1
of	1
the	1
castle	1
stood	1
out	1
against	1
the	1
sky,	1
much	1
nearer	1
and	1
more	1
beautiful.	1
Exactly	1
at	1
noon,	1
the	1
horse	1
turned	1
aside	1
from	1
the	1
road,	1
into	1
a	1
shady	1
grove	1
on	1
a	1
hill,	1
and	1
stopped.	1
"Wise	1
beast,"	1
said	1
his	1
rider:	1
"'haste	1
makes	1
waste,'	1
and	1
all	1
things	1
are	1
better	1
in	1
moderation.	1
I'll	1
follow	1
your	1
example,	1
and	1
eat	1
and	1
rest	1
a	1
bit."	1
He	1
dismounted	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
cool	1
moss,	1
with	1
his	1
back	1
against	1
a	1
tree.	1
He	1
had	1
a	1
lunch	1
in	1
his	1
traveller's	1
pouch,	1
and	1
he	1
ate	1
it	1
comfortably.	1
Then	1
he	1
felt	1
drowsy	1
from	1
the	1
heat	1
and	1
the	1
early	1
ride,	1
so	1
he	1
pulled	1
his	1
hat	1
over	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
settled	1
himself	1
for	1
a	1
nap.	1
"It	1
will	1
go	1
all	1
the	1
better	1
for	1
a	1
little	1
rest,"	1
he	1
said.	1
That	1
_was_	1
a	1
sleep!	1
He	1
slept	1
like	1
the	1
seven	1
sleepers,	1
and	1
he	1
dreamed	1
the	1
most	1
beautiful	1
things	1
you	1
could	1
imagine.	1
At	1
last,	1
he	1
dreamed	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
entered	1
the	1
castle	1
of	1
fortune	1
and	1
was	1
being	1
received	1
with	1
great	1
festivities.	1
Everything	1
he	1
wanted	1
was	1
brought	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
music	1
played	1
while	1
fireworks	1
were	1
set	1
off	1
in	1
his	1
honour.	1
The	1
music	1
was	1
so	1
loud	1
that	1
he	1
awoke.	1
He	1
sat	1
up,	1
rubbing	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
behold,	1
the	1
fireworks	1
were	1
the	1
very	1
last	1
rays	1
of	1
the	1
setting	1
sun,	1
and	1
the	1
music	1
was	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
traveller,	1
passing	1
the	1
grove	1
on	1
foot!	1
"Time	1
to	1
be	1
off,"	1
said	1
the	1
lazy	1
man,	1
and	1
looked	1
about	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
pretty	1
horse.	1
No	1
horse	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
found.	1
The	1
only	1
living	1
thing	1
near	1
was	1
an	1
old,	1
bony,	1
grey	1
donkey.	1
The	1
man	1
called,	1
and	1
whistled,	1
and	1
looked,	1
but	1
no	1
little	1
horse	1
appeared.	1
After	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
he	1
gave	1
it	1
up,	1
and,	1
since	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
better	1
to	1
do,	1
he	1
mounted	1
the	1
old	1
grey	1
donkey	1
and	1
set	1
out	1
again.	1
The	1
donkey	1
was	1
slow,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
hard	1
to	1
ride,	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
better	1
than	1
nothing;	1
and	1
gradually	1
the	1
lazy	1
man	1
saw	1
the	1
towers	1
of	1
the	1
castle	1
draw	1
nearer.	1
Now	1
it	1
began	1
to	1
grow	1
dark;	1
in	1
the	1
castle	1
windows	1
the	1
lights	1
began	1
to	1
show.	1
Then	1
came	1
trouble!	1
Slower,	1
and	1
slower,	1
went	1
the	1
grey	1
donkey;	1
slower,	1
and	1
slower,	1
till,	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
middle	1
of	1
a	1
pitch-black	1
wood,	1
he	1
stopped	1
and	1
stood	1
still.	1
Not	1
a	1
step	1
would	1
he	1
budge	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
coaxing	1
and	1
scolding	1
and	1
beating	1
his	1
rider	1
could	1
give.	1
At	1
last	1
the	1
rider	1
kicked	1
him,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
beat	1
him,	1
and	1
at	1
that	1
the	1
donkey	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
had	1
enough.	1
Up	1
went	1
his	1
hind	1
heels,	1
and	1
down	1
went	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
over	1
it	1
went	1
the	1
lazy	1
man	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
stony	1
ground.	1
There	1
he	1
lay	1
groaning	1
for	1
many	1
minutes,	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
soft	1
place,	1
I	1
can	1
assure	1
you.	1
How	1
he	1
wished	1
he	1
were	1
in	1
a	1
soft,	1
warm	1
bed,	1
with	1
his	1
aching	1
bones	1
comfortable	1
in	1
blankets!	1
The	1
very	1
thought	1
of	1
it	1
made	1
him	1
remember	1
the	1
Castle	1
of	1
Fortune,	1
for	1
he	1
knew	1
there	1
must	1
be	1
fine	1
beds	1
there.	1
To	1
get	1
to	1
those	1
beds	1
he	1
was	1
even	1
willing	1
to	1
bestir	1
his	1
poor	1
limbs,	1
so	1
he	1
sat	1
up	1
and	1
felt	1
about	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
donkey.	1
No	1
donkey	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
found.	1
The	1
lazy	1
man	1
crept	1
round	1
and	1
round	1
the	1
spot	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
fallen,	1
scratched	1
his	1
hands	1
on	1
the	1
stumps,	1
tore	1
his	1
face	1
in	1
the	1
briers,	1
and	1
bumped	1
his	1
knees	1
on	1
the	1
stones.	1
But	1
no	1
donkey	1
was	1
there.	1
He	1
would	1
have	1
laid	1
down	1
to	1
sleep	1
again,	1
but	1
he	1
could	1
hear	1
now	1
the	1
howls	1
of	1
hungry	1
wolves	1
in	1
the	1
woods;	1
that	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
sound	1
pleasant.	1
Finally,	1
his	1
hand	1
struck	1
against	1
something	1
that	1
felt	1
like	1
a	1
saddle.	1
He	1
grasped	1
it,	1
thankfully,	1
and	1
started	1
to	1
mount	1
his	1
donkey.	1
The	1
beast	1
he	1
took	1
hold	1
of	1
seemed	1
very	1
small,	1
and,	1
as	1
he	1
mounted,	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
its	1
sides	1
were	1
moist	1
and	1
slimy.	1
It	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
shudder,	1
and	1
he	1
hesitated;	1
but	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
he	1
heard	1
a	1
distant	1
clock	1
strike.	1
It	1
was	1
striking	1
eleven!	1
There	1
was	1
still	1
time	1
to	1
reach	1
the	1
castle	1
of	1
fortune,	1
but	1
no	1
more	1
than	1
enough;	1
so	1
he	1
mounted	1
his	1
new	1
steed	1
and	1
rode	1
on	1
once	1
more.	1
The	1
animal	1
was	1
easier	1
to	1
sit	1
on	1
than	1
the	1
donkey,	1
and	1
the	1
saddle	1
seemed	1
remarkably	1
high	1
behind;	1
it	1
was	1
good	1
to	1
lean	1
against.	1
But	1
even	1
the	1
donkey	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
slow	1
as	1
this;	1
the	1
new	1
steed	1
was	1
slower	1
than	1
he.	1
After	1
a	1
while,	1
however,	1
he	1
pushed	1
his	1
way	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
woods	1
into	1
the	1
open,	1
and	1
there	1
stood	1
the	1
castle,	1
only	1
a	1
little	1
way	1
ahead!	1
All	1
its	1
windows	1
were	1
ablaze	1
with	1
lights.	1
A	1
ray	1
from	1
them	1
fell	1
on	1
the	1
lazy	1
man's	1
beast,	1
and	1
he	1
saw	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
riding:	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
gigantic	1
snail!	1
a	1
snail	1
as	1
large	1
as	1
a	1
calf!	1
A	1
cold	1
shudder	1
ran	1
over	1
the	1
lazy	1
man's	1
body,	1
and	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
got	1
off	1
his	1
horrid	1
animal	1
then	1
and	1
there,	1
but	1
just	1
then	1
the	1
clock	1
struck	1
once	1
more.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
of	1
the	1
long,	1
slow	1
strokes	1
that	1
mark	1
midnight!	1
The	1
man	1
grew	1
frantic	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
it.	1
He	1
drove	1
his	1
heels	1
into	1
the	1
snail's	1
sides,	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
hurry.	1
Instantly,	1
the	1
snail	1
drew	1
in	1
his	1
head,	1
curled	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
shell,	1
and	1
left	1
the	1
lazy	1
man	1
sitting	1
in	1
a	1
heap	1
on	1
the	1
ground!	1
The	1
clock	1
struck	1
twice.	1
If	1
the	1
man	1
had	1
run	1
for	1
it,	1
he	1
could	1
still	1
have	1
reached	1
the	1
castle,	1
but,	1
instead,	1
he	1
sat	1
still	1
and	1
shouted	1
for	1
a	1
horse.	1
"A	1
beast,	1
a	1
beast!"	1
he	1
wailed,	1
"any	1
kind	1
of	1
a	1
beast	1
that	1
will	1
take	1
me	1
to	1
the	1
castle!"	1
The	1
clock	1
struck	1
three	1
times.	1
And	1
as	1
it	1
struck	1
the	1
third	1
note,	1
something	1
came	1
rustling	1
and	1
rattling	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
darkness,	1
something	1
that	1
sounded	1
like	1
a	1
horse	1
with	1
harness.	1
The	1
lazy	1
man	1
jumped	1
on	1
its	1
back,	1
a	1
very	1
queer,	1
low	1
back.	1
As	1
he	1
mounted,	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
doors	1
of	1
the	1
castle	1
open,	1
and	1
saw	1
his	1
friend	1
standing	1
on	1
the	1
threshold,	1
waving	1
his	1
cap	1
and	1
beckoning	1
to	1
him.	1
The	1
clock	1
struck	1
four	1
times,	1
and	1
the	1
new	1
steed	1
began	1
to	1
stir;	1
as	1
it	1
struck	1
five,	1
he	1
moved	1
a	1
pace	1
forward;	1
as	1
it	1
struck	1
six,	1
he	1
stopped;	1
as	1
it	1
struck	1
seven,	1
he	1
turned	1
himself	1
about;	1
as	1
it	1
struck	1
eight,	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
move	1
backward,	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
castle!	1
The	1
lazy	1
man	1
shouted,	1
and	1
beat	1
him,	1
but	1
the	1
beast	1
went	1
slowly	1
backward.	1
And	1
the	1
clock	1
struck	1
nine.	1
The	1
man	1
tried	1
to	1
slide	1
off,	1
then,	1
but	1
from	1
all	1
sides	1
of	1
his	1
strange	1
animal	1
great	1
arms	1
came	1
reaching	1
up	1
and	1
held	1
him	1
fast.	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
next	1
ray	1
of	1
moonlight	1
that	1
broke	1
the	1
dark	1
clouds,	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
mounted	1
on	1
a	1
monster	1
crab!	1
One	1
by	1
one,	1
the	1
lights	1
went	1
out,	1
in	1
the	1
castle	1
windows.	1
The	1
clock	1
struck	1
ten.	1
Backward	1
went	1
the	1
crab.	1
Eleven!	1
Still	1
the	1
crab	1
went	1
backward.	1
The	1
clock	1
struck	1
twelve!	1
Then	1
the	1
great	1
doors	1
shut	1
with	1
a	1
clang,	1
and	1
the	1
castle	1
of	1
fortune	1
was	1
closed	1
for	1
ever	1
to	1
the	1
lazy	1
man.	1
What	1
became	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
his	1
crab	1
no	1
one	1
knows	1
to	1
this	1
day,	1
and	1
no	1
one	1
cares.	1
But	1
the	1
industrious	1
man	1
was	1
received	1
by	1
the	1
Fairy	1
of	1
Fortune,	1
and	1
made	1
happy	1
in	1
the	1
castle	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
stay.	1
And	1
ever	1
afterward	1
she	1
was	1
his	1
friend,	1
helping	1
him	1
not	1
only	1
to	1
happiness	1
for	1
himself,	1
but	1
also	1
showing	1
him	1
how	1
to	1
help	1
others,	1
wherever	1
he	1
went.	1
DAVID	1
AND	1
GOLIATH	1
A	1
long	1
time	1
ago,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
boy	1
named	1
David,	1
who	1
lived	1
in	1
a	1
country	1
in	1
the	1
Far	1
East.	1
He	1
was	1
good	1
to	1
look	1
upon,	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
fair	1
hair	1
and	1
a	1
ruddy	1
skin;	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
strong	1
and	1
brave	1
and	1
modest.	1
He	1
was	1
shepherd-boy	1
for	1
his	1
father,	1
and	1
all	1
day--often	1
all	1
night--he	1
was	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
fields,	1
far	1
from	1
home,	1
watching	1
over	1
the	1
sheep.	1
He	1
had	1
to	1
guard	1
them	1
from	1
wild	1
animals,	1
and	1
lead	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
pastures,	1
and	1
care	1
for	1
them.	1
By	1
and	1
by,	1
war	1
broke	1
out	1
between	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
David's	1
country	1
and	1
a	1
people	1
that	1
lived	1
near	1
at	1
hand;	1
these	1
men	1
were	1
called	1
Philistines,	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
David's	1
country	1
were	1
named	1
Israelites.	1
All	1
the	1
strong	1
men	1
of	1
Israel	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
battle,	1
to	1
fight	1
for	1
their	1
king.	1
David's	1
three	1
older	1
brothers	1
went,	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
only	1
a	1
boy,	1
so	1
he	1
was	1
left	1
behind	1
to	1
care	1
for	1
the	1
sheep.	1
After	1
the	1
brothers	1
had	1
been	1
gone	1
some	1
time,	1
David's	1
father	1
longed	1
very	1
much	1
to	1
hear	1
from	1
them,	1
and	1
to	1
know	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
safe;	1
so	1
he	1
sent	1
for	1
David,	1
from	1
the	1
fields,	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
"Take	1
now	1
for	1
thy	1
brothers	1
an	1
ephah	1
of	1
this	1
parched	1
corn,	1
and	1
these	1
ten	1
loaves,	1
and	1
run	1
to	1
the	1
camp,	1
where	1
thy	1
brothers	1
are;	1
and	1
carry	1
these	1
ten	1
cheeses	1
to	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
their	1
thousand,	1
and	1
see	1
how	1
thy	1
brothers	1
fare,	1
and	1
bring	1
me	1
word	1
again."	1
(An	1
ephah	1
is	1
about	1
three	1
pecks.)	1
David	1
rose	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
left	1
the	1
sheep	1
with	1
a	1
keeper,	1
and	1
took	1
the	1
corn	1
and	1
the	1
loaves	1
and	1
the	1
cheeses,	1
as	1
his	1
father	1
had	1
commanded	1
him,	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
camp	1
of	1
the	1
Israelites.	1
The	1
camp	1
stood	1
on	1
a	1
mountain	1
on	1
the	1
one	1
side,	1
and	1
the	1
Philistines	1
stood	1
on	1
a	1
mountain	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side;	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
valley	1
between.	1
David	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
the	1
Israelites	1
were,	1
just	1
as	1
the	1
host	1
was	1
going	1
forth	1
to	1
the	1
fight,	1
shouting	1
for	1
the	1
battle.	1
So	1
he	1
left	1
his	1
gifts	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
keeper	1
of	1
the	1
baggage,	1
and	1
ran	1
into	1
the	1
army,	1
amongst	1
the	1
soldiers,	1
to	1
find	1
his	1
brothers.	1
When	1
he	1
found	1
them,	1
he	1
saluted	1
them	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
talk	1
with	1
them.	1
But	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
asking	1
them	1
the	1
questions	1
his	1
father	1
had	1
commanded,	1
there	1
arose	1
a	1
great	1
shouting	1
and	1
tumult	1
among	1
the	1
Israelites,	1
and	1
men	1
came	1
running	1
back	1
from	1
the	1
front	1
line	1
of	1
battle;	1
everything	1
became	1
confusion.	1
David	1
looked	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
the	1
trouble	1
was,	1
and	1
he	1
saw	1
a	1
strange	1
sight:	1
down	1
the	1
slope	1
of	1
the	1
opposite	1
mountain	1
came	1
striding	1
a	1
Philistine	1
warrior,	1
calling	1
out	1
something	1
in	1
a	1
taunting	1
voice;	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
gigantic	1
man,	1
the	1
largest	1
David	1
had	1
ever	1
seen,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
covered	1
with	1
armour,	1
that	1
shone	1
in	1
the	1
sun:	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
helmet	1
of	1
brass	1
upon	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
armed	1
with	1
a	1
coat	1
of	1
mail,	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
greaves	1
of	1
brass	1
upon	1
his	1
legs,	1
and	1
a	1
target	1
of	1
brass	1
between	1
his	1
shoulders;	1
his	1
spear	1
was	1
so	1
tremendous	1
that	1
the	1
staff	1
of	1
it	1
was	1
like	1
a	1
weaver's	1
beam,	1
and	1
his	1
shield	1
so	1
great	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
went	1
before	1
him,	1
to	1
carry	1
it.	1
"Who	1
is	1
that?"	1
asked	1
David.	1
"It	1
is	1
Goliath,	1
of	1
Gath,	1
champion	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines,"	1
said	1
the	1
soldiers	1
about.	1
"Every	1
day,	1
for	1
forty	1
days,	1
he	1
has	1
come	1
forth,	1
so,	1
and	1
challenged	1
us	1
to	1
send	1
a	1
man	1
against	1
him,	1
in	1
single	1
combat;	1
and	1
since	1
no	1
one	1
dares	1
to	1
go	1
out	1
against	1
him	1
alone,	1
the	1
armies	1
cannot	1
fight."	1
(That	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
warfare	1
in	1
those	1
times.)	1
"What!"	1
said	1
David,	1
"does	1
none	1
dare	1
go	1
out	1
against	1
him?"	1
As	1
he	1
spoke,	1
the	1
giant	1
stood	1
still,	1
on	1
the	1
hillside	1
opposite	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
shouted	1
his	1
challenge,	1
scornfully.	1
He	1
said,	1
"Why	1
are	1
ye	1
come	1
out	1
to	1
set	1
your	1
battle	1
in	1
array?	1
Am	1
I	1
not	1
a	1
Philistine,	1
and	1
ye	1
servants	1
of	1
Saul?	1
Choose	1
you	1
a	1
man,	1
and	1
let	1
him	1
come	1
down	1
to	1
me.	1
If	1
he	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
fight	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
to	1
kill	1
me,	1
then	1
will	1
we	1
be	1
your	1
servants;	1
but	1
if	1
I	1
prevail	1
against	1
him,	1
and	1
kill	1
him,	1
then	1
shall	1
ye	1
be	1
our	1
servants,	1
and	1
serve	1
us.	1
I	1
defy	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
Israel	1
this	1
day;	1
give	1
me	1
a	1
man,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
fight	1
together!"	1
When	1
King	1
Saul	1
heard	1
these	1
words,	1
he	1
was	1
dismayed,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel,	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
the	1
man,	1
fled	1
from	1
him	1
and	1
were	1
sore	1
afraid.	1
David	1
heard	1
them	1
talking	1
among	1
themselves,	1
whispering	1
and	1
murmuring.	1
They	1
were	1
saying,	1
"Have	1
ye	1
seen	1
this	1
man	1
that	1
is	1
come	1
up?	1
Surely	1
if	1
anyone	1
killeth	1
him	1
that	1
man	1
will	1
the	1
king	1
make	1
rich;	1
perhaps	1
he	1
will	1
give	1
him	1
his	1
daughter	1
in	1
marriage,	1
and	1
make	1
his	1
family	1
free	1
in	1
Israel!"	1
David	1
heard	1
this,	1
and	1
he	1
asked	1
the	1
men	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
so.	1
It	1
was	1
surely	1
so,	1
they	1
said.	1
"But,"	1
said	1
David,	1
"who	1
is	1
this	1
Philistine,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
defy	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
God?"	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
stirred	1
with	1
anger.	1
Very	1
soon,	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
officers	1
told	1
the	1
king	1
about	1
the	1
youth	1
who	1
was	1
asking	1
so	1
many	1
questions,	1
and	1
who	1
said	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
shame	1
upon	1
Israel	1
that	1
a	1
mere	1
Philistine	1
should	1
defy	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
God.	1
Immediately	1
Saul	1
sent	1
for	1
him.	1
When	1
David	1
came	1
before	1
Saul,	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
king,	1
"Let	1
no	1
man's	1
heart	1
fail	1
because	1
of	1
him;	1
thy	1
servant	1
will	1
go	1
and	1
fight	1
with	1
this	1
Philistine."	1
But	1
Saul	1
looked	1
at	1
David,	1
and	1
said,	1
"Thou	1
art	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
go	1
against	1
this	1
Philistine,	1
to	1
fight	1
with	1
him,	1
for	1
thou	1
art	1
but	1
a	1
youth,	1
and	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
war	1
from	1
his	1
youth."	1
Then	1
David	1
said	1
to	1
Saul,	1
"Once	1
I	1
was	1
keeping	1
my	1
father's	1
sheep,	1
and	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
lion,	1
and	1
a	1
bear,	1
and	1
took	1
a	1
lamb	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
flock;	1
and	1
I	1
went	1
out	1
after	1
the	1
lion,	1
and	1
struck	1
him;	1
and	1
delivered	1
the	1
lamb	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
mouth,	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
arose	1
against	1
me,	1
I	1
caught	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
beard,	1
and	1
struck	1
him,	1
and	1
slew	1
him!	1
Thy	1
servant	1
slew	1
both	1
the	1
lion	1
and	1
the	1
bear;	1
and	1
this	1
Philistine	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
one	1
of	1
them,	1
for	1
he	1
hath	1
defied	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
God.	1
The	1
Lord,	1
who	1
delivered	1
me	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
paw	1
of	1
the	1
lion	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
paw	1
of	1
the	1
bear,	1
he	1
will	1
deliver	1
me	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
this	1
Philistine."	1
"Go,"	1
said	1
Saul,	1
"and	1
the	1
Lord	1
be	1
with	1
thee!"	1
And	1
he	1
armed	1
David	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
armour,--he	1
put	1
a	1
helmet	1
of	1
brass	1
upon	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
armed	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
coat	1
of	1
mail.	1
But	1
when	1
David	1
girded	1
his	1
sword	1
upon	1
his	1
armour,	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
walk,	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
Saul,	1
"I	1
cannot	1
go	1
with	1
these,	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
used	1
to	1
them."	1
And	1
he	1
put	1
them	1
off.	1
Then	1
he	1
took	1
his	1
staff	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
went	1
and	1
chose	1
five	1
smooth	1
stones	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
brook,	1
and	1
put	1
them	1
in	1
a	1
shepherd's	1
bag	1
which	1
he	1
had;	1
and	1
his	1
sling	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
hand;	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
and	1
drew	1
near	1
to	1
the	1
Philistine.	1
And	1
the	1
Philistine	1
came	1
on	1
and	1
drew	1
near	1
to	1
David;	1
and	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
bore	1
his	1
shield	1
went	1
before	1
him.	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
Philistine	1
looked	1
about	1
and	1
saw	1
David,	1
he	1
disdained	1
him,	1
for	1
David	1
was	1
but	1
a	1
boy,	1
and	1
ruddy,	1
and	1
of	1
a	1
fair	1
countenance.	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
David,	1
"Am	1
I	1
a	1
dog,	1
that	1
thou	1
comest	1
to	1
me	1
with	1
a	1
cudgel?"	1
And	1
with	1
curses	1
he	1
cried	1
out	1
again,	1
"Come	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
thy	1
flesh	1
unto	1
the	1
fowls	1
of	1
the	1
air,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
field."	1
But	1
David	1
looked	1
at	1
him,	1
and	1
answered,	1
"Thou	1
comest	1
to	1
me	1
with	1
a	1
sword,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
spear,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
shield;	1
but	1
I	1
come	1
to	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
hosts,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
Israel,	1
whom	1
thou	1
hast	1
defied.	1
This	1
day	1
will	1
the	1
Lord	1
deliver	1
thee	1
into	1
my	1
hand,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
smite	1
thee,	1
and	1
take	1
thy	1
head	1
from	1
thee,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
the	1
carcasses	1
of	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
this	1
day	1
unto	1
the	1
fowls	1
of	1
the	1
air,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
wild	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
earth	1
may	1
know	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
God	1
in	1
Israel!	1
And	1
all	1
this	1
assembly	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
saveth	1
not	1
with	1
sword	1
and	1
spear;	1
for	1
the	1
battle	1
is	1
the	1
Lord's,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
give	1
you	1
into	1
our	1
hands."	1
And	1
then,	1
when	1
the	1
Philistine	1
arose,	1
and	1
came,	1
and	1
drew	1
nigh	1
to	1
meet	1
David,	1
David	1
made	1
haste	1
and	1
ran	1
toward	1
the	1
army	1
to	1
meet	1
the	1
Philistine.	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
way	1
from	1
him,	1
he	1
put	1
his	1
hand	1
in	1
his	1
bag,	1
and	1
took	1
from	1
thence	1
a	1
stone,	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
in	1
his	1
sling,	1
and	1
slung	1
it,	1
and	1
smote	1
the	1
Philistine	1
in	1
the	1
forehead,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
stone	1
sank	1
into	1
his	1
forehead;	1
and	1
he	1
fell	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
to	1
the	1
earth.	1
And	1
David	1
ran,	1
and	1
stood	1
upon	1
the	1
Philistine,	1
and	1
took	1
his	1
sword,	1
and	1
drew	1
it	1
out	1
of	1
its	1
sheath,	1
and	1
slew	1
him	1
with	1
it.	1
Then,	1
when	1
the	1
Philistines	1
saw	1
that	1
their	1
champion	1
was	1
dead,	1
they	1
fled.	1
But	1
the	1
army	1
of	1
Israel	1
pursued	1
them,	1
and	1
victory	1
was	1
with	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel.	1
And	1
after	1
the	1
battle,	1
David	1
was	1
taken	1
to	1
the	1
king's	1
tent,	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
captain	1
over	1
many	1
men;	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
no	1
more	1
to	1
his	1
father's	1
house,	1
to	1
herd	1
the	1
sheep,	1
but	1
became	1
a	1
man,	1
in	1
the	1
king's	1
service.	1
THE	1
SHEPHERD'S	1
SONG	1
David	1
had	1
many	1
fierce	1
battles	1
to	1
fight	1
for	1
King	1
Saul	1
against	1
the	1
enemies	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
he	1
won	1
them	1
all.	1
Then,	1
later,	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
fight	1
against	1
the	1
king's	1
own	1
soldiers,	1
to	1
save	1
himself,	1
for	1
King	1
Saul	1
grew	1
wickedly	1
jealous	1
of	1
David's	1
fame	1
as	1
a	1
soldier,	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
kill	1
him.	1
Twice,	1
when	1
David	1
had	1
a	1
chance	1
to	1
kill	1
the	1
king,	1
he	1
forbore	1
to	1
harm	1
him;	1
but	1
even	1
then,	1
Saul	1
continued	1
trying	1
to	1
take	1
his	1
life,	1
and	1
David	1
was	1
kept	1
away	1
from	1
his	1
home	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
an	1
enemy.	1
But	1
when	1
King	1
Saul	1
died,	1
the	1
people	1
chose	1
David	1
for	1
their	1
king,	1
because	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
one	1
so	1
brave,	1
so	1
wise,	1
or	1
so	1
faithful	1
to	1
God.	1
King	1
David	1
lived	1
a	1
long	1
time,	1
and	1
made	1
his	1
people	1
famous	1
for	1
victory	1
and	1
happiness;	1
he	1
had	1
many	1
troubles	1
and	1
many	1
wars,	1
but	1
he	1
always	1
trusted	1
that	1
God	1
would	1
help	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
never	1
deserted	1
his	1
own	1
people	1
in	1
any	1
hard	1
place.	1
After	1
a	1
battle,	1
or	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
holiday,	1
or	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
thankful	1
for	1
something,	1
King	1
David	1
used	1
to	1
make	1
songs,	1
and	1
sing	1
them	1
before	1
the	1
people.	1
Some	1
of	1
these	1
songs	1
were	1
so	1
beautiful	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
never	1
been	1
forgotten.	1
After	1
all	1
these	1
hundreds	1
and	1
hundred	1
of	1
years,	1
we	1
sing	1
them	1
still;	1
we	1
call	1
them	1
Psalms.	1
Often,	1
after	1
David	1
had	1
made	1
a	1
song,	1
his	1
chief	1
musician	1
would	1
sing	1
with	1
him,	1
as	1
the	1
people	1
gathered	1
to	1
worship	1
God.	1
Sometimes	1
the	1
singers	1
were	1
divided	1
into	1
two	1
great	1
choruses,	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
service	1
in	1
two	1
processions;	1
then	1
one	1
chorus	1
would	1
sing	1
a	1
verse	1
of	1
David's	1
song,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
procession	1
would	1
answer	1
with	1
the	1
next,	1
and	1
then	1
both	1
would	1
sing	1
together;	1
it	1
was	1
very	1
beautiful	1
to	1
hear.	1
Even	1
now,	1
we	1
sometimes	1
do	1
that	1
with	1
the	1
songs	1
of	1
David	1
in	1
our	1
churches.	1
One	1
of	1
his	1
Psalms	1
that	1
everybody	1
loves	1
is	1
a	1
song	1
that	1
David	1
made	1
when	1
he	1
remembered	1
the	1
days	1
before	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
Saul's	1
camp.	1
He	1
remembered	1
the	1
days	1
and	1
nights	1
he	1
used	1
to	1
spend	1
in	1
the	1
fields	1
with	1
the	1
sheep,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
just	1
a	1
shepherd-boy;	1
and	1
he	1
thought	1
to	1
himself	1
that	1
God	1
had	1
taken	1
care	1
of	1
him	1
just	1
as	1
carefully	1
as	1
he	1
himself	1
used	1
to	1
care	1
for	1
the	1
little	1
lambs.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
beautiful	1
song;	1
I	1
wish	1
we	1
knew	1
the	1
music	1
that	1
David	1
made	1
for	1
it,	1
but	1
we	1
only	1
know	1
his	1
words.	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
it	1
to	1
you	1
now,	1
and	1
then	1
you	1
may	1
learn	1
it,	1
to	1
say	1
for	1
yourselves.	1
The	1
Lord	1
is	1
my	1
shepherd;	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
want.	1
He	1
maketh	1
me	1
to	1
lie	1
down	1
in	1
green	1
pastures;	1
he	1
leadeth	1
me	1
beside	1
the	1
still	1
waters.	1
He	1
restoreth	1
my	1
soul;	1
he	1
leadeth	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
paths	1
of	1
righteousness	1
for	1
his	1
name's	1
sake.	1
Yea,	1
though	1
I	1
walk	1
through	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
death,	1
I	1
will	1
fear	1
no	1
evil:	1
for	1
thou	1
art	1
with	1
me;	1
thy	1
rod	1
and	1
thy	1
staff	1
they	1
comfort	1
me.	1
Thou	1
preparest	1
a	1
table	1
before	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
mine	1
enemies:	1
thou	1
anointest	1
my	1
head	1
with	1
oil;	1
my	1
cup	1
runneth	1
over.	1
Surely	1
goodness	1
and	1
mercy	1
shall	1
follow	1
me	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
my	1
life;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
for	1
ever.=	1
THE	1
HIDDEN	1
SERVANTS	1
This	1
is	1
a	1
legend	1
about	1
a	1
hermit	1
who	1
lived	1
long	1
ago.	1
He	1
lived	1
high	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
mountainside	1
in	1
a	1
tiny	1
cave;	1
his	1
food	1
was	1
roots	1
and	1
acorns,	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
bread	1
given	1
by	1
a	1
peasant,	1
or	1
a	1
cheese	1
brought	1
by	1
a	1
woman	1
who	1
wanted	1
his	1
prayers;	1
his	1
work	1
was	1
praying,	1
and	1
thinking	1
about	1
God.	1
For	1
forty	1
years	1
he	1
lived	1
so,	1
preaching	1
to	1
the	1
people,	1
praying	1
for	1
them,	1
comforting	1
them	1
in	1
trouble,	1
and,	1
most	1
of	1
all,	1
worshipping	1
in	1
his	1
heart.	1
There	1
was	1
just	1
one	1
thing	1
he	1
cared	1
about:	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
make	1
his	1
soul	1
so	1
pure	1
and	1
perfect	1
that	1
it	1
could	1
be	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
stones	1
in	1
God's	1
great	1
Temple	1
of	1
Heaven.	1
One	1
day,	1
after	1
the	1
forty	1
years,	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
great	1
longing	1
to	1
know	1
how	1
far	1
along	1
he	1
had	1
got	1
with	1
his	1
work,--how	1
it	1
looked	1
to	1
the	1
Heavenly	1
Father.	1
And	1
he	1
prayed	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
shown	1
a	1
man--	1
"Whose	1
soul	1
in	1
the	1
heavenly	1
grace	1
had	1
grown	1
To	1
the	1
selfsame	1
measure	1
as	1
his	1
own;	1
Whose	1
treasure	1
on	1
the	1
celestial	1
shore	1
Could	1
neither	1
be	1
less	1
than	1
his	1
nor	1
more."	1
As	1
he	1
looked	1
up	1
from	1
his	1
prayer,	1
a	1
white-robed	1
angel	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
path	1
before	1
him.	1
The	1
hermit	1
bowed	1
before	1
the	1
messenger	1
with	1
great	1
gladness,	1
for	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
his	1
wish	1
was	1
answered.	1
"Go	1
to	1
the	1
nearest	1
town,"	1
the	1
angel	1
said,	1
"and	1
there,	1
in	1
the	1
public	1
square,	1
you	1
will	1
find	1
a	1
mountebank	1
(a	1
clown)	1
making	1
the	1
people	1
laugh	1
for	1
money.	1
He	1
is	1
the	1
man	1
you	1
seek;	1
his	1
soul	1
has	1
grown	1
to	1
the	1
selfsame	1
stature	1
as	1
your	1
own;	1
his	1
treasure	1
on	1
the	1
celestial	1
shore	1
is	1
neither	1
less	1
than	1
yours	1
nor	1
more."	1
When	1
the	1
angel	1
had	1
faded	1
from	1
sight,	1
the	1
hermit	1
bowed	1
his	1
head	1
again,	1
but	1
this	1
time	1
with	1
great	1
sorrow	1
and	1
fear.	1
Had	1
his	1
forty	1
years	1
of	1
prayer	1
been	1
a	1
terrible	1
mistake,	1
and	1
was	1
his	1
soul	1
indeed	1
like	1
a	1
clown,	1
fooling	1
in	1
the	1
market-place?	1
He	1
knew	1
not	1
what	1
to	1
think.	1
Almost	1
he	1
hoped	1
he	1
should	1
not	1
find	1
the	1
man,	1
and	1
could	1
believe	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
dreamed	1
the	1
angel	1
vision.	1
But	1
when	1
he	1
came,	1
after	1
a	1
long,	1
tiring	1
walk	1
to	1
the	1
village,	1
and	1
the	1
square,	1
alas!	1
there	1
was	1
the	1
clown,	1
doing	1
his	1
silly	1
tricks	1
for	1
the	1
crowd.	1
The	1
hermit	1
stood	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
terror	1
and	1
sadness,	1
for	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
looking	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
soul.	1
The	1
face	1
he	1
saw	1
was	1
thin	1
and	1
tired,	1
and	1
though	1
it	1
kept	1
a	1
smile	1
or	1
a	1
grin	1
for	1
the	1
people,	1
it	1
seemed	1
very	1
sad	1
to	1
the	1
hermit.	1
Soon	1
the	1
man	1
felt	1
the	1
hermit's	1
eyes;	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
go	1
on	1
with	1
his	1
tricks.	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
stopped	1
and	1
the	1
crowd	1
had	1
left,	1
the	1
hermit	1
went	1
and	1
drew	1
the	1
man	1
aside	1
to	1
a	1
place	1
where	1
they	1
could	1
rest;	1
for	1
he	1
wanted	1
more	1
than	1
anything	1
else	1
on	1
earth	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
the	1
man's	1
soul	1
was	1
like,	1
because	1
what	1
it	1
was,	1
his	1
was.	1
So,	1
after	1
a	1
little,	1
he	1
asked	1
the	1
clown,	1
very	1
gently,	1
what	1
his	1
life	1
was,	1
what	1
it	1
had	1
been.	1
And	1
the	1
clown	1
answered,	1
very	1
sadly,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
just	1
as	1
it	1
looked,--a	1
life	1
of	1
foolish	1
tricks,	1
for	1
that	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
way	1
of	1
earning	1
his	1
bread	1
that	1
he	1
knew.	1
"But	1
have	1
you	1
never	1
been	1
anything	1
different?"	1
asked	1
the	1
hermit,	1
painfully.	1
The	1
clown's	1
head	1
sank	1
in	1
his	1
hands.	1
"Yes,	1
holy	1
father,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"I	1
have	1
been	1
something	1
else.	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
thief!	1
I	1
once	1
belonged	1
to	1
the	1
most	1
wicked	1
band	1
of	1
mountain	1
robbers	1
that	1
ever	1
tormented	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
as	1
wicked	1
as	1
the	1
worst."	1
Alas!	1
The	1
hermit	1
felt	1
that	1
his	1
heart	1
was	1
breaking.	1
Was	1
this	1
how	1
he	1
looked	1
to	1
the	1
Heavenly	1
Father--like	1
a	1
thief,	1
a	1
cruel	1
mountain	1
robber?	1
He	1
could	1
hardly	1
speak,	1
and	1
the	1
tears	1
streamed	1
from	1
his	1
old	1
eyes,	1
but	1
he	1
gathered	1
strength	1
to	1
ask	1
one	1
more	1
question.	1
"I	1
beg	1
you,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"if	1
you	1
have	1
ever	1
done	1
a	1
single	1
good	1
deed	1
in	1
your	1
life,	1
remember	1
it	1
now,	1
and	1
tell	1
it	1
to	1
me";	1
for	1
he	1
thought	1
that	1
even	1
one	1
good	1
deed	1
would	1
save	1
him	1
from	1
utter	1
despair.	1
"Yes,	1
one,"	1
the	1
clown	1
said,	1
"but	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
small,	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
worth	1
telling;	1
my	1
life	1
has	1
been	1
worthless."	1
"Tell	1
me	1
that	1
one!"	1
pleaded	1
the	1
hermit.	1
"Once,"	1
said	1
the	1
man,	1
"our	1
band	1
broke	1
into	1
a	1
convent	1
garden	1
and	1
stole	1
away	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
nuns,	1
to	1
sell	1
as	1
a	1
slave	1
or	1
to	1
keep	1
for	1
a	1
ransom.	1
We	1
dragged	1
her	1
with	1
us	1
over	1
the	1
rough,	1
long	1
way	1
to	1
our	1
mountain	1
camp,	1
and	1
set	1
a	1
guard	1
over	1
her	1
for	1
the	1
night.	1
The	1
poor	1
thing	1
prayed	1
to	1
us	1
so	1
piteously	1
to	1
let	1
her	1
go!	1
And	1
as	1
she	1
begged,	1
she	1
looked	1
from	1
one	1
hard	1
face	1
to	1
another,	1
with	1
trusting,	1
imploring	1
eyes,	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
believe	1
men	1
could	1
be	1
really	1
bad.	1
Father,	1
when	1
her	1
eyes	1
met	1
mine	1
something	1
pierced	1
my	1
heart!	1
Pity	1
and	1
shame	1
leaped	1
up,	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time,	1
within	1
me.	1
But	1
I	1
made	1
my	1
face	1
as	1
hard	1
and	1
cruel	1
as	1
the	1
rest,	1
and	1
she	1
turned	1
away,	1
hopeless.	1
"When	1
all	1
was	1
dark	1
and	1
still,	1
I	1
stole	1
like	1
a	1
cat	1
to	1
where	1
she	1
lay	1
bound.	1
I	1
put	1
my	1
hand	1
on	1
her	1
wrist	1
and	1
whispered,	1
'Trust	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
you	1
safely	1
home.'	1
I	1
cut	1
her	1
bonds	1
with	1
my	1
knife,	1
and	1
she	1
looked	1
at	1
me	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
she	1
trusted.	1
Father,	1
by	1
terrible	1
ways	1
that	1
I	1
knew,	1
hidden	1
from	1
the	1
others,	1
I	1
took	1
her	1
safe	1
to	1
the	1
convent	1
gate.	1
She	1
knocked;	1
they	1
opened;	1
and	1
she	1
slipped	1
inside.	1
And,	1
as	1
she	1
left	1
me,	1
she	1
turned	1
and	1
said,	1
'God	1
will	1
remember.'	1
"That	1
was	1
all.	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
go	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
bad	1
life,	1
and	1
I	1
had	1
never	1
learned	1
an	1
honest	1
way	1
to	1
earn	1
my	1
bread.	1
So	1
I	1
became	1
a	1
clown,	1
and	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
clown	1
until	1
I	1
die."	1
"No!	1
no!	1
my	1
son,"	1
cried	1
the	1
hermit,	1
and	1
now	1
his	1
tears	1
were	1
tears	1
of	1
joy.	1
"God	1
has	1
remembered;	1
your	1
soul	1
is	1
in	1
his	1
sight	1
even	1
as	1
mine,	1
who	1
have	1
prayed	1
and	1
preached	1
for	1
forty	1
years.	1
Your	1
treasure	1
waits	1
for	1
you	1
on	1
the	1
heavenly	1
shore	1
just	1
as	1
mine	1
does."	1
"As	1
_yours_?	1
Father,	1
you	1
mock	1
me!"	1
said	1
the	1
clown.	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
hermit	1
told	1
him	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
his	1
prayer	1
and	1
the	1
angel's	1
answer,	1
the	1
poor	1
clown	1
was	1
transfigured	1
with	1
joy,	1
for	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
his	1
sins	1
were	1
forgiven.	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
hermit	1
went	1
home	1
to	1
his	1
mountain,	1
the	1
clown	1
went	1
with	1
him.	1
He,	1
too,	1
became	1
a	1
hermit,	1
and	1
spent	1
his	1
time	1
in	1
praise	1
and	1
prayer.	1
Together	1
they	1
lived,	1
and	1
worked,	1
and	1
helped	1
the	1
poor.	1
And	1
when,	1
after	1
two	1
years,	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
clown	1
died,	1
the	1
hermit	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
lost	1
a	1
brother	1
more	1
holy	1
than	1
himself.	1
For	1
ten	1
years	1
more	1
the	1
hermit	1
lived	1
in	1
his	1
mountain	1
hut,	1
thinking	1
always	1
of	1
God,	1
fasting	1
and	1
praying,	1
and	1
doing	1
no	1
least	1
thing	1
that	1
was	1
wrong.	1
Then,	1
one	1
day,	1
the	1
wish	1
once	1
more	1
came,	1
to	1
know	1
how	1
his	1
work	1
was	1
growing,	1
and	1
once	1
more	1
he	1
prayed	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
see	1
a	1
being--	1
"Whose	1
soul	1
in	1
the	1
heavenly	1
grace	1
had	1
grown	1
To	1
the	1
selfsame	1
measure	1
as	1
his	1
own;	1
Whose	1
treasure	1
on	1
the	1
celestial	1
shore	1
Could	1
neither	1
be	1
less	1
than	1
his	1
nor	1
more."	1
Once	1
more	1
his	1
prayer	1
was	1
answered.	1
The	1
angel	1
came	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
a	1
certain	1
village	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
mountain,	1
and	1
to	1
a	1
small	1
farm	1
in	1
it,	1
where	1
two	1
women	1
lived.	1
In	1
them	1
he	1
should	1
find	1
two	1
souls	1
like	1
his	1
own,	1
in	1
God's	1
sight.	1
When	1
the	1
hermit	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
farm,	1
the	1
two	1
women	1
who	1
lived	1
there	1
were	1
overjoyed	1
to	1
see	1
him,	1
for	1
everyone	1
loved	1
and	1
honoured	1
his	1
name.	1
They	1
put	1
a	1
chair	1
for	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
cool	1
porch,	1
and	1
brought	1
food	1
and	1
drink.	1
But	1
the	1
hermit	1
was	1
too	1
eager	1
to	1
wait.	1
He	1
longed	1
greatly	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
the	1
souls	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
women	1
were	1
like,	1
and	1
from	1
their	1
looks	1
he	1
could	1
see	1
only	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
gentle	1
and	1
honest.	1
One	1
was	1
old,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
of	1
middle	1
age.	1
Presently	1
he	1
asked	1
them	1
about	1
their	1
lives.	1
They	1
told	1
him	1
the	1
little	1
there	1
was	1
to	1
tell:	1
they	1
had	1
worked	1
hard	1
always,	1
in	1
the	1
fields	1
with	1
their	1
husbands,	1
or	1
in	1
the	1
house;	1
they	1
had	1
many	1
children;	1
they	1
had	1
seen	1
hard	1
times,--sickness,	1
sorrow;	1
but	1
they	1
had	1
never	1
despaired.	1
"But	1
what	1
of	1
your	1
good	1
deeds,"	1
the	1
hermit	1
asked,--"what	1
have	1
you	1
done	1
for	1
God?"	1
"Very	1
little,"	1
they	1
said,	1
sadly,	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
too	1
poor	1
to	1
give	1
much.	1
To	1
be	1
sure,	1
twice	1
every	1
year,	1
when	1
they	1
killed	1
a	1
sheep	1
for	1
food,	1
they	1
gave	1
half	1
to	1
their	1
poorer	1
neighbours.	1
"That	1
is	1
very	1
good,	1
very	1
faithful,"	1
the	1
hermit	1
said.	1
"And	1
is	1
there	1
any	1
other	1
good	1
deed	1
you	1
have	1
done?"	1
"Nothing,"	1
said	1
the	1
older	1
woman,	1
"unless,	1
unless--it	1
might	1
be	1
called	1
a	1
good	1
deed----"	1
She	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
younger	1
woman,	1
who	1
smiled	1
back	1
at	1
her.	1
"What?"	1
said	1
the	1
hermit.	1
Still	1
the	1
woman	1
hesitated;	1
but	1
at	1
last	1
she	1
said,	1
timidly,	1
"It	1
is	1
not	1
much	1
to	1
tell,	1
father,	1
only	1
this,	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
twenty	1
years	1
since	1
my	1
sister-in-law	1
and	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
live	1
together	1
in	1
the	1
house;	1
we	1
have	1
brought	1
up	1
our	1
families	1
here;	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
twenty	1
years	1
there	1
has	1
never	1
been	1
a	1
cross	1
word	1
between	1
us,	1
or	1
a	1
look	1
that	1
was	1
less	1
than	1
kind."	1
The	1
hermit	1
bent	1
his	1
head	1
before	1
the	1
two	1
women,	1
and	1
gave	1
thanks	1
in	1
his	1
heart.	1
"If	1
my	1
soul	1
is	1
as	1
these,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"I	1
am	1
blessed	1
indeed."	1
And	1
suddenly	1
a	1
great	1
light	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
hermit's	1
mind,	1
and	1
he	1
saw	1
how	1
many	1
ways	1
there	1
are	1
of	1
serving	1
God.	1
Some	1
serve	1
him	1
in	1
churches	1
and	1
in	1
hermits'	1
cells,	1
by	1
praise	1
and	1
prayer;	1
some	1
poor	1
souls	1
who	1
have	1
been	1
very	1
wicked	1
turn	1
from	1
their	1
wickedness	1
with	1
sorrow,	1
and	1
serve	1
him	1
with	1
repentance;	1
some	1
live	1
faithfully	1
and	1
gently	1
in	1
humble	1
homes,	1
working,	1
bringing	1
up	1
children,	1
keeping	1
kind	1
and	1
cheerful;	1
some	1
bear	1
pain	1
patiently,	1
for	1
His	1
sake.	1
Endless,	1
endless	1
ways	1
there	1
are,	1
that	1
only	1
the	1
Heavenly	1
Father	1
sees.	1
And	1
so,	1
as	1
the	1
hermit	1
climbed	1
the	1
mountain	1
again,	1
he	1
thought,--	1
"As	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
star-like	1
glow	1
Of	1
light,	1
in	1
the	1
cottage	1
windows	1
far,	1
How	1
many	1
God's	1
hidden	1
servants	1
are!"	1
LITTLE	1
GOTTLIEB	1
Across	1
the	1
North	1
Sea,	1
in	1
a	1
country	1
called	1
Germany,	1
lived	1
a	1
little	1
boy	1
named	1
Gottlieb.	1
His	1
father	1
had	1
died	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
but	1
a	1
baby,	1
and	1
although	1
from	1
early	1
morning	1
till	1
late	1
at	1
night	1
his	1
mother	1
sat	1
plying	1
her	1
needle,	1
she	1
found	1
it	1
difficult	1
indeed	1
to	1
provide	1
food	1
and	1
clothing	1
and	1
shelter	1
for	1
her	1
little	1
boy	1
and	1
herself.	1
Gottlieb	1
was	1
not	1
old	1
enough	1
to	1
work,	1
but	1
he	1
would	1
often	1
sit	1
on	1
a	1
small	1
stool	1
at	1
his	1
mother's	1
feet	1
and	1
dream	1
about	1
the	1
wonderful	1
things	1
he	1
would	1
do	1
for	1
his	1
dear	1
mother	1
when	1
he	1
grew	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
man,	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
comforted	1
as	1
she	1
looked	1
upon	1
her	1
boy,	1
and	1
the	1
thought	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
working	1
for	1
him	1
often	1
gave	1
strength	1
to	1
her	1
tired	1
fingers.	1
But	1
one	1
night	1
Gottlieb	1
saw	1
that	1
his	1
mother	1
was	1
more	1
than	1
usually	1
troubled.	1
Every	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
she	1
would	1
sigh,	1
and	1
a	1
tear	1
would	1
trickle	1
down	1
her	1
cheek.	1
The	1
little	1
boy	1
had	1
grown	1
quick	1
to	1
read	1
these	1
signs	1
of	1
distress,	1
and	1
he	1
thought,	1
"Christmas	1
will	1
be	1
here	1
soon,	1
and	1
dear	1
mother	1
is	1
thinking	1
of	1
what	1
a	1
sad	1
time	1
it	1
will	1
be."	1
What	1
would	1
Gottlieb	1
have	1
given	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
comfort	1
his	1
mother!	1
He	1
could	1
only	1
sit	1
and	1
brood,	1
while	1
his	1
young	1
heart	1
swelled	1
and	1
a	1
lump	1
rose	1
in	1
his	1
throat	1
at	1
the	1
thought	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
do	1
nothing.	1
Presently,	1
however,	1
a	1
happy	1
fancy	1
came	1
to	1
him.	1
Was	1
not	1
the	1
Christ	1
Child	1
born	1
on	1
Christmas	1
Day,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
He	1
send	1
good	1
gifts	1
to	1
men	1
on	1
His	1
birthday?	1
But	1
then	1
came	1
the	1
thought,	1
"He	1
will	1
never	1
find	1
us.	1
Our	1
home	1
is	1
so	1
mean	1
and	1
small."	1
It	1
seemed	1
foolish	1
to	1
hope,	1
but	1
a	1
boy	1
is	1
not	1
long	1
cast	1
down,	1
and	1
as	1
Gottlieb	1
sat	1
dreaming,	1
a	1
happy	1
inspiration	1
came	1
to	1
him.	1
Stealing	1
softly	1
from	1
the	1
room	1
he	1
took	1
paper	1
and	1
pen,	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
learnt	1
to	1
write,	1
and	1
spelt	1
out,	1
word	1
after	1
word,	1
a	1
letter	1
which	1
he	1
addressed	1
to	1
the	1
Christ	1
Child.	1
You	1
may	1
be	1
sure	1
that	1
the	1
postman	1
was	1
puzzled	1
what	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
this	1
letter	1
when	1
he	1
sorted	1
it	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
heap	1
in	1
the	1
letter-box.	1
Perhaps	1
the	1
Burgomaster	1
would	1
know	1
the	1
right	1
thing	1
to	1
do?	1
So	1
the	1
postman	1
took	1
the	1
letter	1
to	1
the	1
great	1
burly	1
man	1
who	1
lived	1
in	1
the	1
big	1
house	1
and	1
wore	1
a	1
gold	1
chain	1
round	1
his	1
neck.	1
The	1
Burgomaster	1
opened	1
the	1
envelope,	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
read	1
the	1
letter	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
trembling	1
hand	1
of	1
a	1
child,	1
tears	1
came	1
into	1
his	1
eyes.	1
But	1
he	1
spoke	1
gruffly	1
enough	1
to	1
the	1
postman,	1
"This	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
foolish	1
boy;	1
a	1
small	1
one,	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
doubt."	1
Soon	1
Christmas	1
morning	1
dawned,	1
and	1
Gottlieb	1
woke	1
very	1
early.	1
But	1
others	1
were	1
up	1
before	1
him,	1
for,	1
to	1
his	1
surprise,	1
he	1
saw	1
a	1
strange	1
gentleman	1
with	1
his	1
mother.	1
His	1
wondering	1
eyes	1
soon	1
perceived	1
other	1
unusual	1
objects,	1
for	1
the	1
hearth	1
was	1
piled	1
with	1
wood,	1
and	1
the	1
table	1
was	1
loaded	1
with	1
food	1
and	1
dainties	1
such	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
even	1
imagined.	1
Gottlieb	1
entered	1
the	1
room	1
just	1
as	1
his	1
mother	1
threw	1
herself	1
at	1
the	1
stranger's	1
feet	1
to	1
bless	1
him	1
for	1
his	1
generous	1
goodness	1
to	1
the	1
widow	1
and	1
orphan.	1
"Nay,	1
give	1
me	1
no	1
thanks,	1
worthy	1
dame,"	1
said	1
the	1
visitor.	1
"Rather	1
be	1
grateful	1
to	1
your	1
little	1
son,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
good	1
Lord	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
wrote	1
for	1
aid."	1
Then	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
Gottlieb	1
with	1
a	1
smile,	1
"You	1
see	1
that	1
although	1
you	1
wrote	1
to	1
the	1
Christ	1
Child,	1
your	1
prayer	1
for	1
aid	1
came	1
only	1
to	1
the	1
Burgomaster.	1
The	1
gifts	1
you	1
asked	1
for	1
are	1
here,	1
but	1
they	1
come	1
from	1
my	1
hand."	1
But	1
Gottlieb	1
answered	1
him	1
humbly,	1
"Nay,	1
sir,	1
the	1
Christ	1
Child	1
sent	1
them,	1
for	1
He	1
put	1
the	1
thought	1
in	1
your	1
heart."	1
HOW	1
THE	1
FIR	1
TREE	1
BECAME	1
THE	1
CHRISTMAS	1
TREE	1
When	1
you	1
stand	1
round	1
the	1
Christmas	1
tree	1
and	1
look	1
longingly	1
at	1
the	1
toys	1
hanging	1
from	1
the	1
prickly	1
branches,	1
it	1
does	1
not	1
occur	1
to	1
you	1
to	1
ask	1
why	1
it	1
is	1
always	1
this	1
particular	1
tree	1
that	1
is	1
so	1
honoured	1
at	1
Christmas.	1
The	1
dark	1
green	1
Fir	1
looks	1
so	1
majestic	1
when	1
laden	1
with	1
bright	1
toys	1
and	1
lit	1
up	1
by	1
Christmas	1
candles,	1
that	1
perhaps	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
easy	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
most	1
modest	1
of	1
trees.	1
But	1
so	1
it	1
is,	1
and	1
because	1
of	1
its	1
humility	1
it	1
was	1
chosen	1
to	1
bear	1
Christmas	1
gifts	1
to	1
the	1
children.	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
story:	1
When	1
the	1
Christ	1
Child	1
was	1
born,	1
all	1
people,	1
animals,	1
trees,	1
and	1
other	1
plants	1
felt	1
that	1
a	1
great	1
happiness	1
had	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
world.	1
And	1
truly,	1
the	1
Heavenly	1
Father	1
had	1
sent	1
with	1
the	1
Holy	1
Babe	1
His	1
blessings	1
of	1
Peace	1
and	1
Goodwill	1
to	1
all.	1
Every	1
day	1
people	1
came	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
sweet	1
Babe,	1
bringing	1
presents	1
in	1
their	1
hands.	1
By	1
the	1
stable	1
wherein	1
lay	1
the	1
Christ	1
Child	1
stood	1
three	1
trees,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
people	1
came	1
and	1
went	1
under	1
their	1
spreading	1
branches,	1
they	1
thought	1
that	1
they,	1
too,	1
would	1
like	1
to	1
give	1
presents	1
to	1
the	1
Child.	1
Said	1
the	1
Palm,	1
"I	1
will	1
choose	1
my	1
biggest	1
leaf	1
and	1
place	1
it	1
as	1
a	1
fan	1
beside	1
the	1
manger	1
to	1
waft	1
soft	1
air	1
to	1
the	1
Child."	1
"And	1
I,"	1
said	1
the	1
Olive,	1
"I	1
will	1
sprinkle	1
sweet-smelling	1
oil	1
over	1
Him."	1
"What	1
can	1
I	1
give	1
to	1
the	1
Child?"	1
asked	1
the	1
Fir.	1
"You?"	1
said	1
the	1
others.	1
"You	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
offer.	1
Your	1
needles	1
would	1
prick	1
the	1
wee	1
Babe,	1
and	1
your	1
tears	1
are	1
sticky."	1
This	1
made	1
the	1
poor	1
Fir	1
very	1
unhappy	1
indeed,	1
and	1
it	1
said,	1
sadly,	1
"Yes,	1
you	1
are	1
right.	1
I	1
have	1
nothing	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
good	1
enough	1
to	1
offer	1
to	1
the	1
Christ	1
Child."	1
Now,	1
quite	1
near	1
to	1
the	1
trees	1
had	1
stood	1
an	1
Angel,	1
who	1
had	1
heard	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
passed.	1
He	1
was	1
moved	1
to	1
pity	1
the	1
Fir,	1
who	1
was	1
so	1
lowly	1
and	1
without	1
envy	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
trees,	1
and	1
he	1
resolved	1
to	1
help	1
it.	1
High	1
in	1
the	1
dark	1
of	1
the	1
heavens	1
the	1
stars	1
were	1
beginning	1
to	1
twinkle,	1
and	1
the	1
Angel	1
begged	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
ones	1
to	1
come	1
down	1
and	1
rest	1
upon	1
the	1
branches	1
of	1
the	1
Fir.	1
This	1
they	1
were	1
glad	1
to	1
do,	1
and	1
their	1
silvery	1
light	1
shone	1
among	1
the	1
branches	1
just	1
like	1
Christmas	1
candles.	1
From	1
where	1
He	1
lay	1
the	1
Christ	1
Child	1
could	1
see	1
the	1
great	1
dark	1
evening	1
world	1
and	1
the	1
darker	1
forms	1
of	1
the	1
trees	1
keeping	1
watch,	1
like	1
faithful	1
guardians,	1
beside	1
the	1
open	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
stable;	1
and	1
to	1
its	1
delight	1
the	1
Fir	1
Tree	1
saw	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
Babe	1
illumined	1
with	1
a	1
heavenly	1
smile	1
as	1
He	1
looked	1
upon	1
the	1
twinkling	1
lights.	1
The	1
Christ	1
Child	1
did	1
not	1
forget	1
the	1
lovely	1
sight,	1
and	1
long	1
afterward	1
he	1
bade	1
that	1
to	1
celebrate	1
His	1
birthday	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
placed	1
in	1
every	1
house	1
a	1
Fir	1
Tree,	1
which	1
might	1
be	1
lit	1
up	1
with	1
candles	1
to	1
shine	1
for	1
the	1
children	1
as	1
the	1
stars	1
shone	1
for	1
Him	1
on	1
His	1
first	1
birthday.	1
Was	1
not	1
the	1
Fir	1
Tree	1
richly	1
rewarded	1
for	1
its	1
meekness?	1
Surely	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
other	1
tree	1
that	1
shines	1
on	1
so	1
many	1
happy	1
faces!	1
THE	1
DIAMOND	1
AND	1
THE	1
DEWDROP	1
A	1
costly	1
Diamond,	1
that	1
had	1
once	1
sparkled	1
in	1
a	1
lady's	1
ring,	1
lay	1
in	1
a	1
field	1
amid	1
tall	1
grasses	1
and	1
oxeye	1
daisies.	1
Just	1
above	1
it,	1
was	1
a	1
big	1
Dewdrop	1
that	1
clung	1
timidly	1
to	1
a	1
nodding	1
grass-blade.	1
Overhead,	1
the	1
blazing	1
sun	1
shone	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
noonday	1
glory.	1
Ever	1
since	1
the	1
first	1
pink	1
blush	1
of	1
dawn,	1
the	1
modest	1
Dewdrop	1
had	1
gazed	1
fixedly	1
down	1
upon	1
the	1
rich	1
gem,	1
but	1
feared	1
to	1
address	1
a	1
person	1
of	1
such	1
exalted	1
consequence.	1
At	1
last,	1
a	1
large	1
Beetle,	1
during	1
his	1
rambles,	1
chanced	1
to	1
espy	1
the	1
Diamond,	1
and	1
he	1
also	1
recognised	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
some	1
one	1
of	1
great	1
rank	1
and	1
importance.	1
"Sire,"	1
he	1
said,	1
making	1
a	1
low	1
bow,	1
"permit	1
your	1
humble	1
servant	1
to	1
offer	1
you	1
greeting."	1
"Tha--nks,"	1
responded	1
the	1
Diamond	1
in	1
languid	1
tones	1
of	1
affectation.	1
As	1
the	1
Beetle	1
raised	1
his	1
head	1
from	1
his	1
profound	1
bow,	1
his	1
gaze	1
happened	1
to	1
alight	1
upon	1
the	1
Dewdrop.	1
"A	1
relative	1
of	1
yours,	1
I	1
presume,	1
Sire?"	1
he	1
remarked	1
affably,	1
waving	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
feelers	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
the	1
Dewdrop.	1
The	1
Diamond	1
burst	1
into	1
a	1
rude,	1
contemptuous	1
laugh.	1
"Quite	1
_too_	1
absurd,	1
I	1
declare!"	1
he	1
exclaimed	1
loftily.	1
"But	1
there,	1
what	1
_can_	1
you	1
expect	1
from	1
a	1
low,	1
grovelling	1
beetle?	1
Away,	1
sir,	1
pass	1
on!	1
Your	1
very	1
presence	1
is	1
distasteful	1
to	1
me.	1
The	1
_idea_	1
of	1
placing	1
ME	1
upon	1
the	1
same	1
level--in	1
the	1
same	1
family,	1
as	1
a	1
low-born,	1
mean,	1
insignificant,	1
utterly	1
valueless----"	1
Here	1
the	1
Diamond	1
fairly	1
choked	1
for	1
breath.	1
"But	1
has	1
he	1
not	1
beauty	1
exactly	1
like	1
your	1
own,	1
Sire?"	1
the	1
Beetle	1
ventured	1
to	1
interpose,	1
though	1
with	1
a	1
very	1
timid	1
air.	1
"BEAU--TY!"	1
flashed	1
the	1
Diamond,	1
with	1
fine	1
disdain--"the	1
impudent	1
fellow	1
merely	1
apes	1
and	1
imitates	1
ME.	1
However,	1
it	1
is	1
some	1
small	1
consolation	1
to	1
remember	1
that	1
'Imitation	1
is	1
the	1
sincerest	1
flattery.'	1
But,	1
even	1
_allowing_	1
him	1
to	1
possess	1
it,	1
mere	1
beauty	1
without	1
_rank_	1
is	1
ridiculous	1
and	1
worthless.	1
A	1
Boat	1
without	1
_water_--a	1
Carriage,	1
but	1
no	1
_horses_--a	1
Well,	1
but	1
never	1
a	1
_winch_:	1
such	1
is	1
beauty	1
without	1
rank	1
and	1
wealth!	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
_real	1
worth_	1
apart	1
from	1
rank	1
and	1
wealth.	1
Combine	1
Beauty,	1
Rank,	1
_and_	1
Wealth,	1
and	1
you	1
have	1
the	1
whole	1
world	1
at	1
your	1
feet.	1
Now	1
you	1
know	1
the	1
secret	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
worshipping	1
ME."	1
And	1
the	1
Diamond	1
sparkled	1
and	1
gleamed	1
with	1
vivid,	1
violet	1
flashes,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
Beetle	1
was	1
glad	1
to	1
shade	1
his	1
eyes.	1
The	1
poor	1
Dewdrop	1
had	1
listened	1
silently	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
passed,	1
and	1
felt	1
so	1
wounded,	1
that	1
at	1
last	1
he	1
wished	1
he	1
never	1
had	1
been	1
born.	1
Slowly	1
a	1
bright	1
tear	1
fell	1
and	1
splashed	1
the	1
dust.	1
Just	1
then,	1
a	1
Skylark	1
fluttered	1
to	1
the	1
ground	1
and	1
eagerly	1
darted	1
his	1
beak	1
at	1
the	1
Diamond.	1
"Alas!"	1
he	1
piped,	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
sob	1
of	1
disappointment.	1
"What	1
I	1
thought	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
precious	1
dewdrop	1
is	1
only	1
a	1
worthless	1
diamond.	1
My	1
throat	1
is	1
parched	1
for	1
want	1
of	1
water.	1
I	1
must	1
die	1
of	1
thirst!"	1
"Really?	1
The	1
world	1
will	1
never	1
get	1
over	1
your	1
loss,"	1
cruelly	1
sneered	1
the	1
Diamond.	1
But	1
a	1
sudden	1
and	1
noble	1
resolve	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
Dewdrop.	1
Deeply	1
did	1
he	1
repent	1
his	1
foolish	1
wish.	1
_He	1
could	1
now	1
lay	1
down	1
his	1
life	1
that	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
another	1
might	1
be	1
saved!_	1
"May	1
_I_	1
help	1
you,	1
please?"	1
he	1
gently	1
asked.	1
The	1
Lark	1
raised	1
his	1
drooping	1
head.	1
"Oh,	1
my	1
precious,	1
precious	1
friend,	1
if	1
you	1
will,	1
you	1
can	1
save	1
my	1
life!"	1
"Open	1
your	1
mouth	1
then."	1
And	1
the	1
Dewdrop	1
slid	1
from	1
the	1
blade	1
of	1
grass,	1
tumbled	1
into	1
the	1
parched	1
beak,	1
and	1
was	1
eagerly	1
swallowed.	1
"Ah--well,	1
well!"	1
pondered	1
the	1
Beetle	1
as	1
he	1
continued	1
his	1
homeward	1
way.	1
"I've	1
been	1
taught	1
a	1
lesson	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
easily	1
forget.	1
Yes,	1
yes!	1
Simple	1
worth	1
is	1
far	1
better	1
than	1
rank	1
or	1
wealth	1
without	1
modesty	1
and	1
unselfishness--and	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
_true_	1
beauty	1
where	1
these	1
virtues	1
are	1
absent!"	1
