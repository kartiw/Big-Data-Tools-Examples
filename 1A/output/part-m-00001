The	1
pale	1
Usher--threadbare	1
in	1
coat,	1
heart,	1
body,	1
and	1
brain;	1
I	1
see	1
him	1
now.	1
He	1
was	1
ever	1
dusting	1
his	1
old	1
lexicons	1
and	1
grammars,	1
with	1
a	1
queer	1
handkerchief,	1
mockingly	1
embellished	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
gay	1
flags	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
known	1
nations	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
He	1
loved	1
to	1
dust	1
his	1
old	1
grammars;	1
it	1
somehow	1
mildly	1
reminded	1
him	1
of	1
his	1
mortality.	1

It	1

be	1

that	1
this	1

burrower	1

grub-worm	1
of	1
a	1
poor	1

of	1
a	1

take	1
the	1

As	1

as	1
the	1

here	1

these	1

Leviathan,	1
by	1
many	1
nations	1
and	1

including	1
our	1

So	1
fare	1
thee	1
well,	1
poor	1
devil	1
of	1
a	1
Sub-Sub,	1
whose	1
commentator	1
I	1
am.	1
Thou	1

that	1
hopeless,	1
sallow	1
tribe	1
which	1
no	1

and	1
for	1
whom	1
even	1
Pale	1

would	1
be	1

rosy-strong;	1
but	1
with	1
whom	1
one	1

loves	1
to	1
sit,	1

feel	1
poor-devilish,	1
too;	1

grow	1

bluntly,	1
with	1
full	1
eyes	1

CHAPTER	1
1	1
Loomings.	1
Call	1
me	1
Ishmael.	1
Some	1
years	1
ago--never	1
mind	1
how	1
long	1
precisely--having	1
little	1
or	1
no	1
money	1
in	1
my	1
purse,	1
and	1
nothing	1
particular	1
to	1
interest	1
me	1
on	1
shore,	1
I	1
thought	1
I	1
would	1
sail	1
about	1
a	1
little	1
and	1
see	1
the	1
watery	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
way	1
I	1
have	1
of	1
driving	1
off	1
the	1
spleen	1
and	1
regulating	1
the	1
circulation.	1
Whenever	1
I	1
find	1
myself	1
growing	1
grim	1
about	1
the	1
mouth;	1
whenever	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
damp,	1
drizzly	1
November	1
in	1
my	1
soul;	1
whenever	1
I	1
find	1
myself	1
involuntarily	1
pausing	1
before	1
coffin	1
warehouses,	1
and	1
bringing	1
up	1
the	1
rear	1
of	1
every	1
funeral	1
I	1
meet;	1
and	1
especially	1
whenever	1
my	1
hypos	1
get	1
such	1
an	1
upper	1
hand	1
of	1
me,	1
that	1
it	1
requires	1
a	1
strong	1
moral	1
principle	1
to	1
prevent	1
me	1
from	1
deliberately	1
stepping	1
into	1
the	1
street,	1
and	1
methodically	1
knocking	1
people's	1
hats	1
off--then,	1
I	1
account	1
it	1
high	1
time	1
to	1
get	1
to	1
sea	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
I	1
can.	1
This	1
is	1
my	1
substitute	1
for	1
pistol	1
and	1
ball.	1
With	1
a	1
philosophical	1
flourish	1
Cato	1
throws	1
himself	1
upon	1
his	1
sword;	1
I	1
quietly	1
take	1
to	1
the	1
ship.	1
There	1
is	1
nothing	1
surprising	1
in	1
this.	1
If	1
they	1
but	1
knew	1
it,	1
almost	1
all	1
men	1
in	1
their	1
degree,	1
some	1
time	1
or	1
other,	1
cherish	1
very	1
nearly	1
the	1
same	1
feelings	1
towards	1
the	1
ocean	1
with	1
me.	1
There	1
now	1
is	1
your	1
insular	1
city	1
of	1
the	1
Manhattoes,	1
belted	1
round	1
by	1
wharves	1
as	1
Indian	1
isles	1
by	1
coral	1
reefs--commerce	1
surrounds	1
it	1
with	1
her	1
surf.	1
Right	1
and	1
left,	1
the	1
streets	1
take	1
you	1
waterward.	1
Its	1
extreme	1
downtown	1
is	1
the	1
battery,	1
where	1
that	1
noble	1
mole	1
is	1
washed	1
by	1
waves,	1
and	1
cooled	1
by	1
breezes,	1
which	1
a	1
few	1
hours	1
previous	1
were	1
out	1
of	1
sight	1
of	1
land.	1
Look	1
at	1
the	1
crowds	1
of	1
water-gazers	1
there.	1
Circumambulate	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
a	1
dreamy	1
Sabbath	1
afternoon.	1
Go	1
from	1
Corlears	1
Hook	1
to	1
Coenties	1
Slip,	1
and	1
from	1
thence,	1
by	1
Whitehall,	1
northward.	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
see?--Posted	1
like	1
silent	1
sentinels	1
all	1
around	1
the	1
town,	1
stand	1
thousands	1
upon	1
thousands	1
of	1
mortal	1
men	1
fixed	1
in	1
ocean	1
reveries.	1
Some	1
leaning	1
against	1
the	1
spiles;	1
some	1
seated	1
upon	1
the	1
pier-heads;	1
some	1
looking	1
over	1
the	1
bulwarks	1
of	1
ships	1
from	1
China;	1
some	1
high	1
aloft	1
in	1
the	1
rigging,	1
as	1
if	1
striving	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
still	1
better	1
seaward	1
peep.	1
But	1
these	1
are	1
all	1
landsmen;	1
of	1
week	1
days	1
pent	1
up	1
in	1
lath	1
and	1
plaster--tied	1
to	1
counters,	1
nailed	1
to	1
benches,	1
clinched	1
to	1
desks.	1
How	1
then	1
is	1
this?	1
Are	1
the	1
green	1
fields	1
gone?	1
What	1
do	1
they	1
here?	1
But	1
look!	1
here	1
come	1
more	1
crowds,	1
pacing	1
straight	1
for	1
the	1
water,	1
and	1
seemingly	1
bound	1
for	1
a	1
dive.	1
Strange!	1
Nothing	1
will	1
content	1
them	1
but	1
the	1
extremest	1
limit	1
of	1
the	1
land;	1
loitering	1
under	1
the	1
shady	1
lee	1
of	1
yonder	1
warehouses	1
will	1
not	1
suffice.	1
No.	1
They	1
must	1
get	1
just	1
as	1
nigh	1
the	1
water	1
as	1
they	1
possibly	1
can	1
without	1
falling	1
in.	1
And	1
there	1
they	1
stand--miles	1
of	1
them--leagues.	1
Inlanders	1
all,	1
they	1
come	1
from	1
lanes	1
and	1
alleys,	1
streets	1
and	1
avenues--north,	1
east,	1
south,	1
and	1
west.	1
Yet	1
here	1
they	1
all	1
unite.	1
Tell	1
me,	1
does	1
the	1
magnetic	1
virtue	1
of	1
the	1
needles	1
of	1
the	1
compasses	1
of	1
all	1
those	1
ships	1
attract	1
them	1
thither?	1
Once	1
more.	1
Say	1
you	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
country;	1
in	1
some	1
high	1
land	1
of	1
lakes.	1
Take	1
almost	1
any	1
path	1
you	1
please,	1
and	1
ten	1
to	1
one	1
it	1
carries	1
you	1
down	1
in	1
a	1
dale,	1
and	1
leaves	1
you	1
there	1
by	1
a	1
pool	1
in	1
the	1
stream.	1
There	1
is	1
magic	1
in	1
it.	1
Let	1
the	1
most	1
absent-minded	1
of	1
men	1
be	1
plunged	1
in	1
his	1
deepest	1
reveries--stand	1
that	1
man	1
on	1
his	1
legs,	1
set	1
his	1
feet	1
a-going,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
infallibly	1
lead	1
you	1
to	1
water,	1
if	1
water	1
there	1
be	1
in	1
all	1
that	1
region.	1
Should	1
you	1
ever	1
be	1
athirst	1
in	1
the	1
great	1
American	1
desert,	1
try	1
this	1
experiment,	1
if	1
your	1
caravan	1
happen	1
to	1
be	1
supplied	1
with	1
a	1
metaphysical	1
professor.	1
Yes,	1
as	1
every	1
one	1
knows,	1
meditation	1
and	1
water	1
are	1
wedded	1
for	1
ever.	1
But	1
here	1
is	1
an	1
artist.	1
He	1
desires	1
to	1
paint	1
you	1
the	1
dreamiest,	1
shadiest,	1
quietest,	1
most	1
enchanting	1
bit	1
of	1
romantic	1
landscape	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
the	1
Saco.	1
What	1
is	1
the	1
chief	1
element	1
he	1
employs?	1
There	1
stand	1
his	1
trees,	1
each	1
with	1
a	1
hollow	1
trunk,	1
as	1
if	1
a	1
hermit	1
and	1
a	1
crucifix	1
were	1
within;	1
and	1
here	1
sleeps	1
his	1
meadow,	1
and	1
there	1
sleep	1
his	1
cattle;	1
and	1
up	1
from	1
yonder	1
cottage	1
goes	1
a	1
sleepy	1
smoke.	1
Deep	1
into	1
distant	1
woodlands	1
winds	1
a	1
mazy	1
way,	1
reaching	1
to	1
overlapping	1
spurs	1
of	1
mountains	1
bathed	1
in	1
their	1
hill-side	1
blue.	1
But	1
though	1
the	1
picture	1
lies	1
thus	1
tranced,	1
and	1
though	1
this	1
pine-tree	1
shakes	1
down	1
its	1
sighs	1
like	1
leaves	1
upon	1
this	1
shepherd's	1
head,	1
yet	1
all	1
were	1
vain,	1
unless	1
the	1
shepherd's	1
eye	1
were	1
fixed	1
upon	1
the	1
magic	1
stream	1
before	1
him.	1
Go	1
visit	1
the	1
Prairies	1
in	1
June,	1
when	1
for	1
scores	1
on	1
scores	1
of	1
miles	1
you	1
wade	1
knee-deep	1
among	1
Tiger-lilies--what	1
is	1
the	1
one	1
charm	1
wanting?--Water--there	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
drop	1
of	1
water	1
there!	1
Were	1
Niagara	1
but	1
a	1
cataract	1
of	1
sand,	1
would	1
you	1
travel	1
your	1
thousand	1
miles	1
to	1
see	1
it?	1
Why	1
did	1
the	1
poor	1
poet	1
of	1
Tennessee,	1
upon	1
suddenly	1
receiving	1
two	1
handfuls	1
of	1
silver,	1
deliberate	1
whether	1
to	1
buy	1
him	1
a	1
coat,	1
which	1
he	1
sadly	1
needed,	1
or	1
invest	1
his	1
money	1
in	1
a	1
pedestrian	1
trip	1
to	1
Rockaway	1
Beach?	1
Why	1
is	1
almost	1
every	1
robust	1
healthy	1
boy	1
with	1
a	1
robust	1
healthy	1
soul	1
in	1
him,	1
at	1
some	1
time	1
or	1
other	1
crazy	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
sea?	1
Why	1
upon	1
your	1
first	1
voyage	1
as	1
a	1
passenger,	1
did	1
you	1
yourself	1
feel	1
such	1
a	1
mystical	1
vibration,	1
when	1
first	1
told	1
that	1
you	1
and	1
your	1
ship	1
were	1
now	1
out	1
of	1
sight	1
of	1
land?	1
Why	1
did	1
the	1
old	1
Persians	1
hold	1
the	1
sea	1
holy?	1
Why	1
did	1
the	1
Greeks	1
give	1
it	1
a	1
separate	1
deity,	1
and	1
own	1
brother	1
of	1
Jove?	1
Surely	1
all	1
this	1
is	1
not	1
without	1
meaning.	1

still	1
deeper	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1

of	1

because	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
grasp	1
the	1
tormenting,	1
mild	1
image	1
he	1
saw	1
in	1
the	1
fountain,	1
plunged	1
into	1
it	1
and	1
was	1
drowned.	1
But	1
that	1
same	1
image,	1
we	1
ourselves	1
see	1
in	1
all	1
rivers	1
and	1
oceans.	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
image	1
of	1
the	1
ungraspable	1
phantom	1
of	1
life;	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
key	1
to	1
it	1
all.	1
Now,	1
when	1
I	1
say	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
the	1
habit	1
of	1
going	1
to	1
sea	1
whenever	1
I	1
begin	1
to	1
grow	1
hazy	1
about	1
the	1
eyes,	1
and	1
begin	1
to	1
be	1
over	1
conscious	1
of	1
my	1
lungs,	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
mean	1
to	1
have	1
it	1
inferred	1
that	1
I	1
ever	1
go	1
to	1
sea	1
as	1
a	1
passenger.	1
For	1
to	1
go	1
as	1
a	1
passenger	1
you	1
must	1
needs	1
have	1
a	1
purse,	1
and	1
a	1
purse	1
is	1
but	1
a	1
rag	1
unless	1
you	1
have	1
something	1
in	1
it.	1
Besides,	1
passengers	1
get	1
sea-sick--grow	1
quarrelsome--don't	1
sleep	1
of	1
nights--do	1
not	1
enjoy	1
themselves	1
much,	1
as	1
a	1
general	1
thing;--no,	1
I	1
never	1
go	1
as	1
a	1
passenger;	1
nor,	1
though	1
I	1
am	1
something	1
of	1
a	1
salt,	1
do	1
I	1
ever	1
go	1
to	1
sea	1
as	1
a	1
Commodore,	1
or	1
a	1
Captain,	1
or	1
a	1
Cook.	1
I	1
abandon	1
the	1
glory	1
and	1
distinction	1
of	1
such	1
offices	1
to	1
those	1
who	1
like	1
them.	1
For	1
my	1
part,	1
I	1
abominate	1
all	1
honourable	1
respectable	1
toils,	1
trials,	1
and	1
tribulations	1
of	1
every	1
kind	1
whatsoever.	1
It	1
is	1
quite	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
I	1
can	1
do	1
to	1
take	1
care	1
of	1
myself,	1
without	1
taking	1
care	1
of	1
ships,	1
barques,	1
brigs,	1
schooners,	1
and	1
what	1
not.	1
And	1
as	1
for	1
going	1
as	1
cook,--though	1
I	1
confess	1
there	1
is	1
considerable	1
glory	1
in	1
that,	1
a	1
cook	1
being	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
officer	1
on	1
ship-board--yet,	1
somehow,	1
I	1
never	1
fancied	1
broiling	1
fowls;--though	1
once	1
broiled,	1
judiciously	1
buttered,	1
and	1
judgmatically	1
salted	1
and	1
peppered,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
one	1
who	1
will	1
speak	1
more	1
respectfully,	1
not	1
to	1
say	1
reverentially,	1
of	1
a	1
broiled	1
fowl	1
than	1
I	1
will.	1
It	1
is	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
idolatrous	1
dotings	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
Egyptians	1
upon	1
broiled	1
ibis	1
and	1
roasted	1
river	1
horse,	1
that	1
you	1
see	1
the	1
mummies	1
of	1
those	1
creatures	1
in	1
their	1
huge	1
bake-houses	1
the	1
pyramids.	1
No,	1
when	1
I	1
go	1
to	1
sea,	1
I	1
go	1
as	1
a	1
simple	1
sailor,	1
right	1
before	1
the	1
mast,	1
plumb	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
forecastle,	1
aloft	1
there	1
to	1
the	1
royal	1
mast-head.	1
True,	1
they	1
rather	1
order	1
me	1
about	1
some,	1
and	1
make	1
me	1
jump	1
from	1
spar	1
to	1
spar,	1
like	1
a	1
grasshopper	1
in	1
a	1
May	1
meadow.	1
And	1
at	1
first,	1
this	1
sort	1
of	1
thing	1
is	1
unpleasant	1
enough.	1
It	1
touches	1
one's	1
sense	1
of	1
honour,	1
particularly	1
if	1
you	1
come	1
of	1
an	1
old	1
established	1
family	1
in	1
the	1
land,	1
the	1
Van	1
Rensselaers,	1
or	1
Randolphs,	1
or	1
Hardicanutes.	1
And	1
more	1
than	1
all,	1
if	1
just	1
previous	1
to	1
putting	1
your	1
hand	1
into	1
the	1
tar-pot,	1
you	1
have	1
been	1
lording	1
it	1
as	1
a	1
country	1
schoolmaster,	1
making	1
the	1
tallest	1
boys	1
stand	1
in	1
awe	1
of	1
you.	1
The	1
transition	1
is	1
a	1
keen	1
one,	1
I	1
assure	1
you,	1
from	1
a	1
schoolmaster	1
to	1
a	1
sailor,	1
and	1
requires	1
a	1
strong	1
decoction	1
of	1
Seneca	1
and	1
the	1
Stoics	1
to	1
enable	1
you	1
to	1
grin	1
and	1
bear	1
it.	1
But	1
even	1
this	1
wears	1
off	1
in	1
time.	1
What	1
of	1
it,	1
if	1
some	1
old	1
hunks	1
of	1
a	1
sea-captain	1
orders	1
me	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
broom	1
and	1
sweep	1
down	1
the	1
decks?	1
What	1
does	1
that	1
indignity	1
amount	1
to,	1
weighed,	1
I	1
mean,	1
in	1
the	1
scales	1
of	1
the	1
New	1
Testament?	1
Do	1
you	1
think	1
the	1
archangel	1
Gabriel	1
thinks	1
anything	1
the	1
less	1
of	1
me,	1
because	1
I	1
promptly	1
and	1
respectfully	1
obey	1
that	1
old	1
hunks	1
in	1
that	1
particular	1
instance?	1
Who	1
ain't	1
a	1
slave?	1
Tell	1
me	1
that.	1
Well,	1
then,	1
however	1
the	1
old	1
sea-captains	1
may	1
order	1
me	1
about--however	1
they	1
may	1
thump	1
and	1
punch	1
me	1
about,	1
I	1
have	1
the	1
satisfaction	1
of	1
knowing	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
all	1
right;	1
that	1
everybody	1
else	1
is	1
one	1
way	1
or	1
other	1
served	1
in	1
much	1
the	1
same	1
way--either	1
in	1
a	1
physical	1
or	1
metaphysical	1
point	1
of	1
view,	1
that	1
is;	1
and	1
so	1
the	1
universal	1
thump	1
is	1
passed	1
round,	1
and	1
all	1
hands	1
should	1
rub	1
each	1
other's	1
shoulder-blades,	1
and	1
be	1
content.	1
Again,	1
I	1
always	1
go	1
to	1
sea	1
as	1
a	1
sailor,	1
because	1
they	1
make	1
a	1
point	1
of	1
paying	1
me	1
for	1
my	1
trouble,	1
whereas	1
they	1
never	1
pay	1
passengers	1
a	1
single	1
penny	1
that	1
I	1
ever	1
heard	1
of.	1
On	1
the	1
contrary,	1
passengers	1
themselves	1
must	1
pay.	1
And	1
there	1
is	1
all	1
the	1
difference	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
between	1
paying	1
and	1
being	1
paid.	1
The	1
act	1
of	1
paying	1
is	1
perhaps	1
the	1
most	1
uncomfortable	1
infliction	1
that	1
the	1
two	1
orchard	1
thieves	1
entailed	1
upon	1
us.	1
But	1
BEING	1
PAID,--what	1
will	1
compare	1
with	1
it?	1
The	1
urbane	1
activity	1
with	1
which	1
a	1
man	1
receives	1
money	1
is	1
really	1
marvellous,	1
considering	1
that	1
we	1
so	1
earnestly	1
believe	1
money	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
root	1
of	1
all	1
earthly	1
ills,	1
and	1
that	1
on	1
no	1
account	1
can	1
a	1
monied	1
man	1
enter	1
heaven.	1
Ah!	1
how	1
cheerfully	1
we	1
consign	1
ourselves	1
to	1
perdition!	1
Finally,	1
I	1
always	1
go	1
to	1
sea	1
as	1
a	1
sailor,	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
wholesome	1
exercise	1
and	1
pure	1
air	1
of	1
the	1
fore-castle	1
deck.	1
For	1
as	1
in	1
this	1
world,	1
head	1
winds	1
are	1
far	1
more	1
prevalent	1
than	1
winds	1
from	1
astern	1
(that	1
is,	1
if	1
you	1
never	1
violate	1
the	1
Pythagorean	1
maxim),	1
so	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
part	1
the	1
Commodore	1
on	1
the	1
quarter-deck	1
gets	1
his	1
atmosphere	1
at	1
second	1
hand	1
from	1
the	1
sailors	1
on	1
the	1
forecastle.	1
He	1
thinks	1
he	1
breathes	1
it	1
first;	1
but	1
not	1
so.	1
In	1
much	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
do	1
the	1
commonalty	1
lead	1
their	1
leaders	1
in	1
many	1
other	1
things,	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
that	1
the	1
leaders	1
little	1
suspect	1
it.	1
But	1
wherefore	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
after	1
having	1
repeatedly	1
smelt	1
the	1
sea	1
as	1
a	1
merchant	1
sailor,	1
I	1
should	1
now	1
take	1
it	1
into	1
my	1
head	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
a	1
whaling	1
voyage;	1
this	1
the	1
invisible	1
police	1
officer	1
of	1
the	1
Fates,	1
who	1
has	1
the	1
constant	1
surveillance	1
of	1
me,	1
and	1
secretly	1
dogs	1
me,	1
and	1
influences	1
me	1
in	1
some	1
unaccountable	1
way--he	1
can	1
better	1
answer	1
than	1
any	1
one	1
else.	1
And,	1
doubtless,	1
my	1
going	1
on	1
this	1
whaling	1
voyage,	1
formed	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
grand	1
programme	1
of	1
Providence	1
that	1
was	1
drawn	1
up	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
ago.	1
It	1
came	1
in	1
as	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
brief	1
interlude	1
and	1
solo	1
between	1
more	1
extensive	1
performances.	1
I	1
take	1
it	1
that	1
this	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
bill	1
must	1
have	1
run	1
something	1
like	1
this:	1
"GRAND	1
CONTESTED	1
ELECTION	1
FOR	1
THE	1
PRESIDENCY	1
OF	1
THE	1
UNITED	1
STATES.	1
"WHALING	1
VOYAGE	1
BY	1
ONE	1
ISHMAEL.	1
"BLOODY	1
BATTLE	1
IN	1
AFFGHANISTAN."	1
Though	1
I	1
cannot	1
tell	1
why	1
it	1
was	1
exactly	1
that	1
those	1
stage	1
managers,	1
the	1
Fates,	1
put	1
me	1
down	1
for	1
this	1
shabby	1
part	1
of	1
a	1
whaling	1
voyage,	1
when	1
others	1
were	1
set	1
down	1
for	1
magnificent	1
parts	1
in	1
high	1
tragedies,	1
and	1
short	1
and	1
easy	1
parts	1
in	1
genteel	1
comedies,	1
and	1
jolly	1
parts	1
in	1
farces--though	1
I	1
cannot	1
tell	1
why	1
this	1
was	1
exactly;	1
yet,	1
now	1
that	1
I	1
recall	1
all	1
the	1
circumstances,	1
I	1
think	1
I	1
can	1
see	1
a	1
little	1
into	1
the	1
springs	1
and	1
motives	1
which	1
being	1
cunningly	1
presented	1
to	1
me	1
under	1
various	1
disguises,	1
induced	1
me	1
to	1
set	1
about	1
performing	1
the	1
part	1
I	1
did,	1
besides	1
cajoling	1
me	1
into	1
the	1
delusion	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
choice	1
resulting	1
from	1
my	1
own	1
unbiased	1
freewill	1
and	1
discriminating	1
judgment.	1
Chief	1
among	1
these	1
motives	1
was	1
the	1
overwhelming	1
idea	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
whale	1
himself.	1
Such	1
a	1
portentous	1
and	1
mysterious	1
monster	1
roused	1
all	1
my	1
curiosity.	1
Then	1
the	1
wild	1
and	1
distant	1
seas	1
where	1
he	1
rolled	1
his	1
island	1
bulk;	1
the	1
undeliverable,	1
nameless	1
perils	1
of	1
the	1
whale;	1
these,	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
attending	1
marvels	1
of	1
a	1
thousand	1
Patagonian	1
sights	1
and	1
sounds,	1
helped	1
to	1
sway	1
me	1
to	1
my	1
wish.	1
With	1
other	1
men,	1
perhaps,	1
such	1
things	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
inducements;	1
but	1
as	1
for	1
me,	1
I	1
am	1
tormented	1
with	1
an	1
everlasting	1
itch	1
for	1
things	1
remote.	1
I	1
love	1
to	1
sail	1
forbidden	1
seas,	1
and	1
land	1
on	1
barbarous	1
coasts.	1
Not	1
ignoring	1
what	1
is	1
good,	1
I	1
am	1
quick	1
to	1
perceive	1
a	1
horror,	1
and	1
could	1
still	1
be	1
social	1
with	1
it--would	1
they	1
let	1
me--since	1
it	1
is	1
but	1
well	1
to	1
be	1
on	1
friendly	1
terms	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
inmates	1
of	1
the	1
place	1
one	1
lodges	1
in.	1
By	1
reason	1
of	1
these	1
things,	1
then,	1
the	1
whaling	1
voyage	1
was	1
welcome;	1
the	1
great	1
flood-gates	1
of	1
the	1
wonder-world	1
swung	1
open,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
wild	1
conceits	1
that	1
swayed	1
me	1
to	1
my	1
purpose,	1
two	1
and	1
two	1
there	1
floated	1
into	1
my	1
inmost	1
soul,	1
endless	1
processions	1
of	1
the	1
whale,	1
and,	1
mid	1
most	1
of	1
them	1
all,	1
one	1
grand	1
hooded	1
phantom,	1
like	1
a	1
snow	1
hill	1
in	1
the	1
air.	1
CHAPTER	1
2	1
The	1
Carpet-Bag.	1
I	1
stuffed	1
a	1
shirt	1
or	1
two	1
into	1
my	1
old	1
carpet-bag,	1
tucked	1
it	1
under	1
my	1
arm,	1
and	1
started	1
for	1
Cape	1
Horn	1
and	1
the	1
Pacific.	1
Quitting	1
the	1
good	1
city	1
of	1
old	1
Manhatto,	1
I	1
duly	1
arrived	1
in	1
New	1
Bedford.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
Saturday	1
night	1
in	1
December.	1
Much	1
was	1
I	1
disappointed	1
upon	1
learning	1
that	1
the	1
little	1
packet	1
for	1
Nantucket	1
had	1
already	1
sailed,	1
and	1
that	1
no	1
way	1
of	1
reaching	1
that	1
place	1
would	1
offer,	1
till	1
the	1
following	1
Monday.	1
As	1
most	1
young	1
candidates	1
for	1
the	1
pains	1
and	1
penalties	1
of	1
whaling	1
stop	1
at	1
this	1
same	1
New	1
Bedford,	1
thence	1
to	1
embark	1
on	1
their	1
voyage,	1
it	1
may	1
as	1
well	1
be	1
related	1
that	1
I,	1
for	1
one,	1
had	1
no	1
idea	1
of	1
so	1
doing.	1
For	1
my	1
mind	1
was	1
made	1
up	1
to	1
sail	1
in	1
no	1
other	1
than	1
a	1
Nantucket	1
craft,	1
because	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
fine,	1
boisterous	1
something	1
about	1
everything	1
connected	1
with	1
that	1
famous	1
old	1
island,	1
which	1
amazingly	1
pleased	1
me.	1
Besides	1
though	1
New	1
Bedford	1
has	1
of	1
late	1
been	1
gradually	1
monopolising	1
the	1
business	1
of	1
whaling,	1
and	1
though	1
in	1
this	1
matter	1
poor	1
old	1
Nantucket	1
is	1
now	1
much	1
behind	1
her,	1
yet	1
Nantucket	1
was	1
her	1
great	1
original--the	1
Tyre	1
of	1
this	1
Carthage;--the	1
place	1
where	1
the	1
first	1
dead	1
American	1
whale	1
was	1
stranded.	1
Where	1
else	1
but	1
from	1
Nantucket	1
did	1
those	1
aboriginal	1
whalemen,	1
the	1
Red-Men,	1
first	1
sally	1
out	1
in	1
canoes	1
to	1
give	1
chase	1
to	1
the	1
Leviathan?	1
And	1
where	1
but	1
from	1
Nantucket,	1
too,	1
did	1
that	1
first	1
adventurous	1
little	1
sloop	1
put	1
forth,	1
partly	1
laden	1
with	1
imported	1
cobblestones--so	1
goes	1
the	1
story--to	1
throw	1
at	1
the	1
whales,	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
discover	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
nigh	1
enough	1
to	1
risk	1
a	1
harpoon	1
from	1
the	1
bowsprit?	1
Now	1
having	1
a	1
night,	1
a	1
day,	1
and	1
still	1
another	1
night	1
following	1
before	1
me	1
in	1
New	1
Bedford,	1
ere	1
I	1
could	1
embark	1
for	1
my	1
destined	1
port,	1
it	1
became	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
concernment	1
where	1
I	1
was	1
to	1
eat	1
and	1
sleep	1
meanwhile.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
dubious-looking,	1
nay,	1
a	1
very	1
dark	1
and	1
dismal	1
night,	1
bitingly	1
cold	1
and	1
cheerless.	1
I	1
knew	1
no	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
place.	1
With	1
anxious	1
grapnels	1
I	1
had	1
sounded	1
my	1
pocket,	1
and	1
only	1
brought	1
up	1
a	1
few	1
pieces	1
of	1
silver,--So,	1
wherever	1
you	1
go,	1
Ishmael,	1
said	1
I	1
to	1
myself,	1
as	1
I	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
a	1
dreary	1
street	1
shouldering	1
my	1
bag,	1
and	1
comparing	1
the	1
gloom	1
towards	1
the	1
north	1
with	1
the	1
darkness	1
towards	1
the	1
south--wherever	1
in	1
your	1
wisdom	1
you	1
may	1
conclude	1
to	1
lodge	1
for	1
the	1
night,	1
my	1
dear	1
Ishmael,	1
be	1
sure	1
to	1
inquire	1
the	1
price,	1
and	1
don't	1
be	1
too	1
particular.	1
With	1
halting	1
steps	1
I	1
paced	1
the	1
streets,	1
and	1
passed	1
the	1
sign	1
of	1
"The	1
Crossed	1
Harpoons"--but	1
it	1
looked	1
too	1
expensive	1
and	1
jolly	1
there.	1
Further	1
on,	1
from	1
the	1
bright	1
red	1
windows	1
of	1
the	1
"Sword-Fish	1
Inn,"	1
there	1
came	1
such	1
fervent	1
rays,	1
that	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
melted	1
the	1
packed	1
snow	1
and	1
ice	1
from	1
before	1
the	1
house,	1
for	1
everywhere	1
else	1
the	1
congealed	1
frost	1
lay	1
ten	1
inches	1
thick	1
in	1
a	1
hard,	1
asphaltic	1
pavement,--rather	1
weary	1
for	1
me,	1
when	1
I	1
struck	1
my	1
foot	1
against	1
the	1
flinty	1
projections,	1
because	1
from	1
hard,	1
remorseless	1
service	1
the	1
soles	1
of	1
my	1
boots	1
were	1
in	1
a	1
most	1
miserable	1
plight.	1
Too	1
expensive	1
and	1
jolly,	1
again	1
thought	1
I,	1
pausing	1
one	1
moment	1
to	1
watch	1
the	1
broad	1
glare	1
in	1
the	1
street,	1
and	1
hear	1
the	1
sounds	1
of	1
the	1
tinkling	1
glasses	1
within.	1
But	1
go	1
on,	1
Ishmael,	1
said	1
I	1
at	1
last;	1
don't	1
you	1
hear?	1
get	1
away	1
from	1
before	1
the	1
door;	1
your	1
patched	1
boots	1
are	1
stopping	1
the	1
way.	1
So	1
on	1
I	1
went.	1
I	1
now	1
by	1
instinct	1
followed	1
the	1
streets	1
that	1
took	1
me	1
waterward,	1
for	1
there,	1
doubtless,	1
were	1
the	1
cheapest,	1
if	1
not	1
the	1
cheeriest	1
inns.	1
Such	1
dreary	1
streets!	1
blocks	1
of	1
blackness,	1
not	1
houses,	1
on	1
either	1
hand,	1
and	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
a	1
candle,	1
like	1
a	1
candle	1
moving	1
about	1
in	1
a	1
tomb.	1
At	1
this	1
hour	1
of	1
the	1
night,	1
of	1
the	1
last	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
week,	1
that	1
quarter	1
of	1
the	1
town	1
proved	1
all	1
but	1
deserted.	1
But	1
presently	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
smoky	1
light	1
proceeding	1
from	1
a	1
low,	1
wide	1
building,	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
which	1
stood	1
invitingly	1
open.	1
It	1
had	1
a	1
careless	1
look,	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
meant	1
for	1
the	1
uses	1
of	1
the	1
public;	1
so,	1
entering,	1
the	1
first	1
thing	1
I	1
did	1
was	1
to	1
stumble	1
over	1
an	1
ash-box	1
in	1
the	1
porch.	1
Ha!	1
thought	1
I,	1
ha,	1
as	1
the	1
flying	1
particles	1
almost	1
choked	1
me,	1
are	1
these	1
ashes	1
from	1
that	1
destroyed	1
city,	1
Gomorrah?	1
But	1
"The	1
Crossed	1
Harpoons,"	1
and	1
"The	1
Sword-Fish?"--this,	1
then	1
must	1
needs	1
be	1
the	1
sign	1
of	1
"The	1
Trap."	1
However,	1
I	1
picked	1
myself	1
up	1
and	1
hearing	1
a	1
loud	1
voice	1
within,	1
pushed	1
on	1
and	1
opened	1
a	1
second,	1
interior	1
door.	1
It	1
seemed	1
the	1
great	1
Black	1
Parliament	1
sitting	1
in	1
Tophet.	1
A	1
hundred	1
black	1
faces	1
turned	1
round	1
in	1
their	1
rows	1
to	1
peer;	1
and	1
beyond,	1
a	1
black	1
Angel	1
of	1
Doom	1
was	1
beating	1
a	1
book	1
in	1
a	1
pulpit.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
negro	1
church;	1
and	1
the	1
preacher's	1
text	1
was	1
about	1
the	1
blackness	1
of	1
darkness,	1
and	1
the	1
weeping	1
and	1
wailing	1
and	1
teeth-gnashing	1
there.	1
Ha,	1
Ishmael,	1
muttered	1
I,	1
backing	1
out,	1
Wretched	1
entertainment	1
at	1
the	1
sign	1
of	1
'The	1
Trap!'	1
Moving	1
on,	1
I	1
at	1
last	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
dim	1
sort	1
of	1
light	1
not	1
far	1
from	1
the	1
docks,	1
and	1
heard	1
a	1
forlorn	1
creaking	1
in	1
the	1
air;	1
and	1
looking	1
up,	1
saw	1
a	1
swinging	1
sign	1
over	1
the	1
door	1
with	1
a	1
white	1
painting	1
upon	1
it,	1
faintly	1
representing	1
a	1
tall	1
straight	1
jet	1
of	1
misty	1
spray,	1
and	1
these	1
words	1
underneath--"The	1
Spouter	1
Inn:--Peter	1
Coffin."	1
Coffin?--Spouter?--Rather	1
ominous	1
in	1
that	1
particular	1
connexion,	1
thought	1
I.	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
common	1
name	1
in	1
Nantucket,	1
they	1
say,	1
and	1
I	1
suppose	1
this	1
Peter	1
here	1
is	1
an	1
emigrant	1
from	1
there.	1
As	1
the	1
light	1
looked	1
so	1
dim,	1
and	1
the	1
place,	1
for	1
the	1
time,	1
looked	1
quiet	1
enough,	1
and	1
the	1
dilapidated	1
little	1
wooden	1
house	1
itself	1
looked	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
carted	1
here	1
from	1
the	1
ruins	1
of	1
some	1
burnt	1
district,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
swinging	1
sign	1
had	1
a	1
poverty-stricken	1
sort	1
of	1
creak	1
to	1
it,	1
I	1
thought	1
that	1
here	1
was	1
the	1
very	1
spot	1
for	1
cheap	1
lodgings,	1
and	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
pea	1
coffee.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
queer	1
sort	1
of	1
place--a	1
gable-ended	1
old	1
house,	1
one	1
side	1
palsied	1
as	1
it	1
were,	1
and	1
leaning	1
over	1
sadly.	1
It	1
stood	1
on	1
a	1
sharp	1
bleak	1
corner,	1
where	1
that	1
tempestuous	1
wind	1
Euroclydon	1
kept	1
up	1
a	1
worse	1
howling	1
than	1
ever	1
it	1
did	1
about	1
poor	1
Paul's	1
tossed	1
craft.	1
Euroclydon,	1
nevertheless,	1
is	1
a	1
mighty	1
pleasant	1
zephyr	1
to	1
any	1
one	1
in-doors,	1
with	1
his	1
feet	1
on	1
the	1
hob	1
quietly	1
toasting	1
for	1
bed.	1
"In	1
judging	1
of	1
that	1
tempestuous	1
wind	1
called	1
Euroclydon,"	1
says	1
an	1
old	1
writer--of	1
whose	1
works	1
I	1
possess	1
the	1
only	1
copy	1
extant--"it	1
maketh	1
a	1
marvellous	1
difference,	1
whether	1
thou	1
lookest	1
out	1
at	1
it	1
from	1
a	1
glass	1
window	1
where	1
the	1
frost	1
is	1
all	1
on	1
the	1
outside,	1
or	1
whether	1
thou	1
observest	1
it	1
from	1
that	1
sashless	1
window,	1
where	1
the	1
frost	1
is	1
on	1
both	1
sides,	1
and	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
wight	1
Death	1
is	1
the	1
only	1
glazier."	1
True	1
enough,	1
thought	1
I,	1
as	1
this	1
passage	1
occurred	1
to	1
my	1
mind--old	1
black-letter,	1
thou	1
reasonest	1
well.	1
Yes,	1
these	1
eyes	1
are	1
windows,	1
and	1
this	1
body	1
of	1
mine	1
is	1
the	1
house.	1
What	1
a	1
pity	1
they	1
didn't	1
stop	1
up	1
the	1
chinks	1
and	1
the	1
crannies	1
though,	1
and	1
thrust	1
in	1
a	1
little	1
lint	1
here	1
and	1
there.	1
But	1
it's	1
too	1
late	1
to	1
make	1
any	1
improvements	1
now.	1
The	1
universe	1
is	1
finished;	1
the	1
copestone	1
is	1
on,	1
and	1
the	1
chips	1
were	1
carted	1
off	1
a	1
million	1
years	1
ago.	1
Poor	1
Lazarus	1
there,	1
chattering	1
his	1
teeth	1
against	1
the	1
curbstone	1
for	1
his	1
pillow,	1
and	1
shaking	1
off	1
his	1
tatters	1
with	1
his	1
shiverings,	1
he	1
might	1
plug	1
up	1
both	1
ears	1
with	1
rags,	1
and	1
put	1
a	1
corn-cob	1
into	1
his	1
mouth,	1
and	1
yet	1
that	1
would	1
not	1
keep	1
out	1
the	1
tempestuous	1
Euroclydon.	1
Euroclydon!	1
says	1
old	1
Dives,	1
in	1
his	1
red	1
silken	1
wrapper--(he	1
had	1
a	1
redder	1
one	1
afterwards)	1
pooh,	1
pooh!	1
What	1
a	1
fine	1
frosty	1
night;	1
how	1
Orion	1
glitters;	1
what	1
northern	1
lights!	1
Let	1
them	1
talk	1
of	1
their	1
oriental	1
summer	1
climes	1
of	1
everlasting	1
conservatories;	1
give	1
me	1
the	1
privilege	1
of	1
making	1
my	1
own	1
summer	1
with	1
my	1
own	1
coals.	1
But	1
what	1
thinks	1
Lazarus?	1
Can	1
he	1
warm	1
his	1
blue	1
hands	1
by	1
holding	1
them	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
grand	1
northern	1
lights?	1
Would	1
not	1
Lazarus	1
rather	1
be	1
in	1
Sumatra	1
than	1
here?	1
Would	1
he	1
not	1
far	1
rather	1
lay	1
him	1
down	1
lengthwise	1
along	1
the	1
line	1
of	1
the	1
equator;	1
yea,	1
ye	1
gods!	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
fiery	1
pit	1
itself,	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
keep	1
out	1
this	1
frost?	1
Now,	1
that	1
Lazarus	1
should	1
lie	1
stranded	1
there	1
on	1
the	1
curbstone	1
before	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
Dives,	1
this	1
is	1
more	1
wonderful	1
than	1
that	1
an	1
iceberg	1
should	1
be	1
moored	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
Moluccas.	1
Yet	1
Dives	1
himself,	1
he	1
too	1
lives	1
like	1
a	1
Czar	1
in	1
an	1
ice	1
palace	1
made	1
of	1
frozen	1
sighs,	1
and	1
being	1
a	1
president	1
of	1
a	1
temperance	1
society,	1
he	1
only	1
drinks	1
the	1
tepid	1
tears	1
of	1
orphans.	1
But	1
no	1
more	1
of	1
this	1
blubbering	1
now,	1
we	1
are	1
going	1
a-whaling,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
plenty	1
of	1
that	1
yet	1
to	1
come.	1
Let	1
us	1
scrape	1
the	1
ice	1
from	1
our	1
frosted	1
feet,	1
and	1
see	1
what	1
sort	1
of	1
a	1
place	1
this	1
"Spouter"	1
may	1
be.	1
CHAPTER	1
3	1
The	1
Spouter-Inn.	1
Entering	1
that	1
gable-ended	1
Spouter-Inn,	1
you	1
found	1
yourself	1
in	1
a	1
wide,	1
low,	1
straggling	1
entry	1
with	1
old-fashioned	1
wainscots,	1
reminding	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
bulwarks	1
of	1
some	1
condemned	1
old	1
craft.	1
On	1
one	1
side	1
hung	1
a	1
very	1
large	1
oilpainting	1
so	1
thoroughly	1
besmoked,	1
and	1
every	1
way	1
defaced,	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
unequal	1
crosslights	1
by	1
which	1
you	1
viewed	1
it,	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
by	1
diligent	1
study	1
and	1
a	1
series	1
of	1
systematic	1
visits	1
to	1
it,	1
and	1
careful	1
inquiry	1
of	1
the	1
neighbors,	1
that	1
you	1
could	1
any	1
way	1
arrive	1
at	1
an	1
understanding	1
of	1
its	1
purpose.	1
Such	1
unaccountable	1
masses	1
of	1
shades	1
and	1
shadows,	1
that	1
at	1
first	1
you	1
almost	1
thought	1
some	1
ambitious	1
young	1
artist,	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
New	1
England	1
hags,	1
had	1
endeavored	1
to	1
delineate	1
chaos	1
bewitched.	1
But	1
by	1
dint	1
of	1
much	1
and	1
earnest	1
contemplation,	1
and	1
oft	1
repeated	1
ponderings,	1
and	1
especially	1
by	1
throwing	1
open	1
the	1
little	1
window	1
towards	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
the	1
entry,	1
you	1
at	1
last	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
conclusion	1
that	1
such	1
an	1
idea,	1
however	1
wild,	1
might	1
not	1
be	1
altogether	1
unwarranted.	1
But	1
what	1
most	1
puzzled	1
and	1
confounded	1
you	1
was	1
a	1
long,	1
limber,	1
portentous,	1
black	1
mass	1
of	1
something	1
hovering	1
in	1
the	1
centre	1
of	1
the	1
picture	1
over	1
three	1
blue,	1
dim,	1
perpendicular	1
lines	1
floating	1
in	1
a	1
nameless	1
yeast.	1
A	1
boggy,	1
soggy,	1
squitchy	1
picture	1
truly,	1
enough	1
to	1
drive	1
a	1
nervous	1
man	1
distracted.	1
Yet	1
was	1
there	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
indefinite,	1
half-attained,	1
unimaginable	1
sublimity	1
about	1
it	1
that	1
fairly	1
froze	1
you	1
to	1
it,	1
till	1
you	1
involuntarily	1
took	1
an	1
oath	1
with	1
yourself	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
what	1
that	1
marvellous	1
painting	1
meant.	1
Ever	1
and	1
anon	1
a	1
bright,	1
but,	1
alas,	1
deceptive	1
idea	1
would	1
dart	1
you	1
through.--It's	1
the	1
Black	1
Sea	1
in	1
a	1
midnight	1
gale.--It's	1
the	1
unnatural	1
combat	1
of	1
the	1
four	1
primal	1
elements.--It's	1
a	1
blasted	1
heath.--It's	1
a	1
Hyperborean	1
winter	1
scene.--It's	1
the	1
breaking-up	1
of	1
the	1
icebound	1
stream	1
of	1
Time.	1
But	1
at	1
last	1
all	1
these	1
fancies	1
yielded	1
to	1
that	1
one	1
portentous	1
something	1
in	1
the	1
picture's	1
midst.	1
THAT	1
once	1
found	1
out,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
were	1
plain.	1
But	1
stop;	1
does	1
it	1
not	1
bear	1
a	1
faint	1
resemblance	1
to	1
a	1
gigantic	1
fish?	1
even	1
the	1
great	1
leviathan	1
himself?	1
In	1
fact,	1
the	1
artist's	1
design	1
seemed	1
this:	1
a	1
final	1
theory	1
of	1
my	1
own,	1
partly	1
based	1
upon	1
the	1
aggregated	1
opinions	1
of	1
many	1
aged	1
persons	1
with	1
whom	1
I	1
conversed	1
upon	1
the	1
subject.	1
The	1
picture	1
represents	1
a	1
Cape-Horner	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
hurricane;	1
the	1
half-foundered	1
ship	1
weltering	1
there	1
with	1
its	1
three	1
dismantled	1
masts	1
alone	1
visible;	1
and	1
an	1
exasperated	1
whale,	1
purposing	1
to	1
spring	1
clean	1
over	1
the	1
craft,	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
enormous	1
act	1
of	1
impaling	1
himself	1
upon	1
the	1
three	1
mast-heads.	1
The	1
opposite	1
wall	1
of	1
this	1
entry	1
was	1
hung	1
all	1
over	1
with	1
a	1
heathenish	1
array	1
of	1
monstrous	1
clubs	1
and	1
spears.	1
Some	1
were	1
thickly	1
set	1
with	1
glittering	1
teeth	1
resembling	1
ivory	1
saws;	1
others	1
were	1
tufted	1
with	1
knots	1
of	1
human	1
hair;	1
and	1
one	1
was	1
sickle-shaped,	1
with	1
a	1
vast	1
handle	1
sweeping	1
round	1
like	1
the	1
segment	1
made	1
in	1
the	1
new-mown	1
grass	1
by	1
a	1
long-armed	1
mower.	1
You	1
shuddered	1
as	1
you	1
gazed,	1
and	1
wondered	1
what	1
monstrous	1
cannibal	1
and	1
savage	1
could	1
ever	1
have	1
gone	1
a	1
death-harvesting	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
hacking,	1
horrifying	1
implement.	1
Mixed	1
with	1
these	1
were	1
rusty	1
old	1
whaling	1
lances	1
and	1
harpoons	1
all	1
broken	1
and	1
deformed.	1
Some	1
were	1
storied	1
weapons.	1
With	1
this	1
once	1
long	1
lance,	1
now	1
wildly	1
elbowed,	1
fifty	1
years	1
ago	1
did	1
Nathan	1
Swain	1
kill	1
fifteen	1
whales	1
between	1
a	1
sunrise	1
and	1
a	1
sunset.	1
And	1
that	1
harpoon--so	1
like	1
a	1
corkscrew	1
now--was	1
flung	1
in	1
Javan	1
seas,	1
and	1
run	1
away	1
with	1
by	1
a	1
whale,	1
years	1
afterwards	1
slain	1
off	1
the	1
Cape	1
of	1
Blanco.	1
The	1
original	1
iron	1
entered	1
nigh	1
the	1
tail,	1
and,	1
like	1
a	1
restless	1
needle	1
sojourning	1
in	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
a	1
man,	1
travelled	1
full	1
forty	1
feet,	1
and	1
at	1
last	1
was	1
found	1
imbedded	1
in	1
the	1
hump.	1
Crossing	1
this	1
dusky	1
entry,	1
and	1
on	1
through	1
yon	1
low-arched	1
way--cut	1
through	1
what	1
in	1
old	1
times	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
great	1
central	1
chimney	1
with	1
fireplaces	1
all	1
round--you	1
enter	1
the	1
public	1
room.	1
A	1
still	1
duskier	1
place	1
is	1
this,	1
with	1
such	1
low	1
ponderous	1
beams	1
above,	1
and	1
such	1
old	1
wrinkled	1
planks	1
beneath,	1
that	1
you	1
would	1
almost	1
fancy	1
you	1
trod	1
some	1
old	1
craft's	1
cockpits,	1
especially	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
howling	1
night,	1
when	1
this	1
corner-anchored	1
old	1
ark	1
rocked	1
so	1
furiously.	1
On	1
one	1
side	1
stood	1
a	1
long,	1
low,	1
shelf-like	1
table	1
covered	1
with	1
cracked	1
glass	1
cases,	1
filled	1
with	1
dusty	1
rarities	1
gathered	1
from	1
this	1
wide	1
world's	1
remotest	1
nooks.	1
Projecting	1
from	1
the	1
further	1
angle	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
stands	1
a	1
dark-looking	1
den--the	1
bar--a	1
rude	1
attempt	1
at	1
a	1
right	1
whale's	1
head.	1
Be	1
that	1
how	1
it	1
may,	1
there	1
stands	1
the	1
vast	1
arched	1
bone	1
of	1
the	1
whale's	1
jaw,	1
so	1
wide,	1
a	1
coach	1
might	1
almost	1
drive	1
beneath	1
it.	1
Within	1
are	1
shabby	1
shelves,	1
ranged	1
round	1
with	1
old	1
decanters,	1
bottles,	1
flasks;	1
and	1
in	1
those	1
jaws	1
of	1
swift	1
destruction,	1
like	1
another	1
cursed	1
Jonah	1
(by	1
which	1
name	1
indeed	1
they	1
called	1
him),	1
bustles	1
a	1
little	1
withered	1
old	1
man,	1
who,	1
for	1
their	1
money,	1
dearly	1
sells	1
the	1
sailors	1
deliriums	1
and	1
death.	1
Abominable	1
are	1
the	1
tumblers	1
into	1
which	1
he	1
pours	1
his	1
poison.	1
Though	1
true	1
cylinders	1
without--within,	1
the	1
villanous	1
green	1
goggling	1
glasses	1
deceitfully	1
tapered	1
downwards	1
to	1
a	1
cheating	1
bottom.	1
Parallel	1
meridians	1
rudely	1
pecked	1
into	1
the	1
glass,	1
surround	1
these	1
footpads'	1
goblets.	1
Fill	1
to	1
THIS	1
mark,	1
and	1
your	1
charge	1
is	1
but	1
a	1
penny;	1
to	1
THIS	1
a	1
penny	1
more;	1
and	1
so	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
full	1
glass--the	1
Cape	1
Horn	1
measure,	1
which	1
you	1
may	1
gulp	1
down	1
for	1
a	1
shilling.	1
Upon	1
entering	1
the	1
place	1
I	1
found	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
young	1
seamen	1
gathered	1
about	1
a	1
table,	1
examining	1
by	1
a	1
dim	1
light	1
divers	1
specimens	1
of	1
SKRIMSHANDER.	1
I	1
sought	1
the	1
landlord,	1
and	1
telling	1
him	1
I	1
desired	1
to	1
be	1
accommodated	1
with	1
a	1
room,	1
received	1
for	1
answer	1
that	1
his	1
house	1
was	1
full--not	1
a	1
bed	1
unoccupied.	1
"But	1
avast,"	1
he	1
added,	1
tapping	1
his	1
forehead,	1
"you	1
haint	1
no	1
objections	1
to	1
sharing	1
a	1
harpooneer's	1
blanket,	1
have	1
ye?	1
I	1
s'pose	1
you	1
are	1
goin'	1
a-whalin',	1
so	1
you'd	1
better	1
get	1
used	1
to	1
that	1
sort	1
of	1
thing."	1
I	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
I	1
never	1
liked	1
to	1
sleep	1
two	1
in	1
a	1
bed;	1
that	1
if	1
I	1
should	1
ever	1
do	1
so,	1
it	1
would	1
depend	1
upon	1
who	1
the	1
harpooneer	1
might	1
be,	1
and	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
(the	1
landlord)	1
really	1
had	1
no	1
other	1
place	1
for	1
me,	1
and	1
the	1
harpooneer	1
was	1
not	1
decidedly	1
objectionable,	1
why	1
rather	1
than	1
wander	1
further	1
about	1
a	1
strange	1
town	1
on	1
so	1
bitter	1
a	1
night,	1
I	1
would	1
put	1
up	1
with	1
the	1
half	1
of	1
any	1
decent	1
man's	1
blanket.	1
"I	1
thought	1
so.	1
All	1
right;	1
take	1
a	1
seat.	1
Supper?--you	1
want	1
supper?	1
Supper'll	1
be	1
ready	1
directly."	1
I	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
an	1
old	1
wooden	1
settle,	1
carved	1
all	1
over	1
like	1
a	1
bench	1
on	1
the	1
Battery.	1
At	1
one	1
end	1
a	1
ruminating	1
tar	1
was	1
still	1
further	1
adorning	1
it	1
with	1
his	1
jack-knife,	1
stooping	1
over	1
and	1
diligently	1
working	1
away	1
at	1
the	1
space	1
between	1
his	1
legs.	1
He	1
was	1
trying	1
his	1
hand	1
at	1
a	1
ship	1
under	1
full	1
sail,	1
but	1
he	1
didn't	1
make	1
much	1
headway,	1
I	1
thought.	1
At	1
last	1
some	1
four	1
or	1
five	1
of	1
us	1
were	1
summoned	1
to	1
our	1
meal	1
in	1
an	1
adjoining	1
room.	1
It	1
was	1
cold	1
as	1
Iceland--no	1
fire	1
at	1
all--the	1
landlord	1
said	1
he	1
couldn't	1
afford	1
it.	1
Nothing	1
but	1
two	1
dismal	1
tallow	1
candles,	1
each	1
in	1
a	1
winding	1
sheet.	1
We	1
were	1
fain	1
to	1
button	1
up	1
our	1
monkey	1
jackets,	1
and	1
hold	1
to	1
our	1
lips	1
cups	1
of	1
scalding	1
tea	1
with	1
our	1
half	1
frozen	1
fingers.	1
But	1
the	1
fare	1
was	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
substantial	1
kind--not	1
only	1
meat	1
and	1
potatoes,	1
but	1
dumplings;	1
good	1
heavens!	1
dumplings	1
for	1
supper!	1
One	1
young	1
fellow	1
in	1
a	1
green	1
box	1
coat,	1
addressed	1
himself	1
to	1
these	1
dumplings	1
in	1
a	1
most	1
direful	1
manner.	1
"My	1
boy,"	1
said	1
the	1
landlord,	1
"you'll	1
have	1
the	1
nightmare	1
to	1
a	1
dead	1
sartainty."	1
"Landlord,"	1
I	1
whispered,	1
"that	1
aint	1
the	1
harpooneer	1
is	1
it?"	1
"Oh,	1
no,"	1
said	1
he,	1
looking	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
diabolically	1
funny,	1
"the	1
harpooneer	1
is	1
a	1
dark	1
complexioned	1
chap.	1
He	1
never	1
eats	1
dumplings,	1
he	1
don't--he	1
eats	1
nothing	1
but	1
steaks,	1
and	1
he	1
likes	1
'em	1
rare."	1
"The	1
devil	1
he	1
does,"	1
says	1
I.	1
"Where	1
is	1
that	1
harpooneer?	1
Is	1
he	1
here?"	1
"He'll	1
be	1
here	1
afore	1
long,"	1
was	1
the	1
answer.	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
it,	1
but	1
I	1
began	1
to	1
feel	1
suspicious	1
of	1
this	1
"dark	1
complexioned"	1
harpooneer.	1
At	1
any	1
rate,	1
I	1
made	1
up	1
my	1
mind	1
that	1
if	1
it	1
so	1
turned	1
out	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
sleep	1
together,	1
he	1
must	1
undress	1
and	1
get	1
into	1
bed	1
before	1
I	1
did.	1
Supper	1
over,	1
the	1
company	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
bar-room,	1
when,	1
knowing	1
not	1
what	1
else	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
myself,	1
I	1
resolved	1
to	1
spend	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
evening	1
as	1
a	1
looker	1
on.	1
Presently	1
a	1
rioting	1
noise	1
was	1
heard	1
without.	1
Starting	1
up,	1
the	1
landlord	1
cried,	1
"That's	1
the	1
Grampus's	1
crew.	1
I	1
seed	1
her	1
reported	1
in	1
the	1
offing	1
this	1
morning;	1
a	1
three	1
years'	1
voyage,	1
and	1
a	1
full	1
ship.	1
Hurrah,	1
boys;	1
now	1
we'll	1
have	1
the	1
latest	1
news	1
from	1
the	1
Feegees."	1
A	1
tramping	1
of	1
sea	1
boots	1
was	1
heard	1
in	1
the	1
entry;	1
the	1
door	1
was	1
flung	1
open,	1
and	1
in	1
rolled	1
a	1
wild	1
set	1
of	1
mariners	1
enough.	1
Enveloped	1
in	1
their	1
shaggy	1
watch	1
coats,	1
and	1
with	1
their	1
heads	1
muffled	1
in	1
woollen	1
comforters,	1
all	1
bedarned	1
and	1
ragged,	1
and	1
their	1
beards	1
stiff	1
with	1
icicles,	1
they	1
seemed	1
an	1
eruption	1
of	1
bears	1
from	1
Labrador.	1
They	1
had	1
just	1
landed	1
from	1
their	1
boat,	1
and	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
house	1
they	1
entered.	1
No	1
wonder,	1
then,	1
that	1
they	1
made	1
a	1
straight	1
wake	1
for	1
the	1
whale's	1
mouth--the	1
bar--when	1
the	1
wrinkled	1
little	1
old	1
Jonah,	1
there	1
officiating,	1
soon	1
poured	1
them	1
out	1
brimmers	1
all	1
round.	1
One	1
complained	1
of	1
a	1
bad	1
cold	1
in	1
his	1
head,	1
upon	1
which	1
Jonah	1
mixed	1
him	1
a	1
pitch-like	1
potion	1
of	1
gin	1
and	1
molasses,	1
which	1
he	1
swore	1
was	1
a	1
sovereign	1
cure	1
for	1
all	1
colds	1
and	1
catarrhs	1
whatsoever,	1
never	1
mind	1
of	1
how	1
long	1
standing,	1
or	1
whether	1
caught	1
off	1
the	1
coast	1
of	1
Labrador,	1
or	1
on	1
the	1
weather	1
side	1
of	1
an	1
ice-island.	1
The	1
liquor	1
soon	1
mounted	1
into	1
their	1
heads,	1
as	1
it	1
generally	1
does	1
even	1
with	1
the	1
arrantest	1
topers	1
newly	1
landed	1
from	1
sea,	1
and	1
they	1
began	1
capering	1
about	1
most	1
obstreperously.	1
I	1
observed,	1
however,	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
held	1
somewhat	1
aloof,	1
and	1
though	1
he	1
seemed	1
desirous	1
not	1
to	1
spoil	1
the	1
hilarity	1
of	1
his	1
shipmates	1
by	1
his	1
own	1
sober	1
face,	1
yet	1
upon	1
the	1
whole	1
he	1
refrained	1
from	1
making	1
as	1
much	1
noise	1
as	1
the	1
rest.	1
This	1
man	1
interested	1
me	1
at	1
once;	1
and	1
since	1
the	1
sea-gods	1
had	1
ordained	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
soon	1
become	1
my	1
shipmate	1
(though	1
but	1
a	1
sleeping-partner	1
one,	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
this	1
narrative	1
is	1
concerned),	1
I	1
will	1
here	1
venture	1
upon	1
a	1
little	1
description	1
of	1
him.	1
He	1
stood	1
full	1
six	1
feet	1
in	1
height,	1
with	1
noble	1
shoulders,	1
and	1
a	1
chest	1
like	1
a	1
coffer-dam.	1
I	1
have	1
seldom	1
seen	1
such	1
brawn	1
in	1
a	1
man.	1
His	1
face	1
was	1
deeply	1
brown	1
and	1
burnt,	1
making	1
his	1
white	1
teeth	1
dazzling	1
by	1
the	1
contrast;	1
while	1
in	1
the	1
deep	1
shadows	1
of	1
his	1
eyes	1
floated	1
some	1
reminiscences	1
that	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
much	1
joy.	1
His	1
voice	1
at	1
once	1
announced	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
Southerner,	1
and	1
from	1
his	1
fine	1
stature,	1
I	1
thought	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
tall	1
mountaineers	1
from	1
the	1
Alleghanian	1
Ridge	1
in	1
Virginia.	1
When	1
the	1
revelry	1
of	1
his	1
companions	1
had	1
mounted	1
to	1
its	1
height,	1
this	1
man	1
slipped	1
away	1
unobserved,	1
and	1
I	1
saw	1
no	1
more	1
of	1
him	1
till	1
he	1
became	1
my	1
comrade	1
on	1
the	1
sea.	1
In	1
a	1
few	1
minutes,	1
however,	1
he	1
was	1
missed	1
by	1
his	1
shipmates,	1
and	1
being,	1
it	1
seems,	1
for	1
some	1
reason	1
a	1
huge	1
favourite	1
with	1
them,	1
they	1
raised	1
a	1
cry	1
of	1
"Bulkington!	1
Bulkington!	1
where's	1
Bulkington?"	1
and	1
darted	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
in	1
pursuit	1
of	1
him.	1
It	1
was	1
now	1
about	1
nine	1
o'clock,	1
and	1
the	1
room	1
seeming	1
almost	1
supernaturally	1
quiet	1
after	1
these	1
orgies,	1
I	1
began	1
to	1
congratulate	1
myself	1
upon	1
a	1
little	1
plan	1
that	1
had	1
occurred	1
to	1
me	1
just	1
previous	1
to	1
the	1
entrance	1
of	1
the	1
seamen.	1
No	1
man	1
prefers	1
to	1
sleep	1
two	1
in	1
a	1
bed.	1
In	1
fact,	1
you	1
would	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
rather	1
not	1
sleep	1
with	1
your	1
own	1
brother.	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
how	1
it	1
is,	1
but	1
people	1
like	1
to	1
be	1
private	1
when	1
they	1
are	1
sleeping.	1
And	1
when	1
it	1
comes	1
to	1
sleeping	1
with	1
an	1
unknown	1
stranger,	1
in	1
a	1
strange	1
inn,	1
in	1
a	1
strange	1
town,	1
and	1
that	1
stranger	1
a	1
harpooneer,	1
then	1
your	1
objections	1
indefinitely	1
multiply.	1
Nor	1
was	1
there	1
any	1
earthly	1
reason	1
why	1
I	1
as	1
a	1
sailor	1
should	1
sleep	1
two	1
in	1
a	1
bed,	1
more	1
than	1
anybody	1
else;	1
for	1
sailors	1
no	1
more	1
sleep	1
two	1
in	1
a	1
bed	1
at	1
sea,	1
than	1
bachelor	1
Kings	1
do	1
ashore.	1
To	1
be	1
sure	1
they	1
all	1
sleep	1
together	1
in	1
one	1
apartment,	1
but	1
you	1
have	1
your	1
own	1
hammock,	1
and	1
cover	1
yourself	1
with	1
your	1
own	1
blanket,	1
and	1
sleep	1
in	1
your	1
own	1
skin.	1
The	1
more	1
I	1
pondered	1
over	1
this	1
harpooneer,	1
the	1
more	1
I	1
abominated	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
sleeping	1
with	1
him.	1
It	1
was	1
fair	1
to	1
presume	1
that	1
being	1
a	1
harpooneer,	1
his	1
linen	1
or	1
woollen,	1
as	1
the	1
case	1
might	1
be,	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
of	1
the	1
tidiest,	1
certainly	1
none	1
of	1
the	1
finest.	1
I	1
began	1
to	1
twitch	1
all	1
over.	1
Besides,	1
it	1
was	1
getting	1
late,	1
and	1
my	1
decent	1
harpooneer	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
home	1
and	1
going	1
bedwards.	1
Suppose	1
now,	1
he	1
should	1
tumble	1
in	1
upon	1
me	1
at	1
midnight--how	1
could	1
I	1
tell	1
from	1
what	1
vile	1
hole	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
coming?	1
"Landlord!	1
I've	1
changed	1
my	1
mind	1
about	1
that	1
harpooneer.--I	1
shan't	1
sleep	1
with	1
him.	1
I'll	1
try	1
the	1
bench	1
here."	1
"Just	1
as	1
you	1
please;	1
I'm	1
sorry	1
I	1
cant	1
spare	1
ye	1
a	1
tablecloth	1
for	1
a	1
mattress,	1
and	1
it's	1
a	1
plaguy	1
rough	1
board	1
here"--feeling	1
of	1
the	1
knots	1
and	1
notches.	1
"But	1
wait	1
a	1
bit,	1
Skrimshander;	1
I've	1
got	1
a	1
carpenter's	1
plane	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
bar--wait,	1
I	1
say,	1
and	1
I'll	1
make	1
ye	1
snug	1
enough."	1
So	1
saying	1
he	1
procured	1
the	1
plane;	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
old	1
silk	1
handkerchief	1
first	1
dusting	1
the	1
bench,	1
vigorously	1
set	1
to	1
planing	1
away	1
at	1
my	1
bed,	1
the	1
while	1
grinning	1
like	1
an	1
ape.	1
The	1
shavings	1
flew	1
right	1
and	1
left;	1
till	1
at	1
last	1
the	1
plane-iron	1
came	1
bump	1
against	1
an	1
indestructible	1
knot.	1
The	1
landlord	1
was	1
near	1
spraining	1
his	1
wrist,	1
and	1
I	1
told	1
him	1
for	1
heaven's	1
sake	1
to	1
quit--the	1
bed	1
was	1
soft	1
enough	1
to	1
suit	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
all	1
the	1
planing	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
could	1
make	1
eider	1
down	1
of	1
a	1
pine	1
plank.	1
So	1
gathering	1
up	1
the	1
shavings	1
with	1
another	1
grin,	1
and	1
throwing	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
great	1
stove	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
room,	1
he	1
went	1
about	1
his	1
business,	1
and	1
left	1
me	1
in	1
a	1
brown	1
study.	1
I	1
now	1
took	1
the	1
measure	1
of	1
the	1
bench,	1
and	1
found	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
foot	1
too	1
short;	1
but	1
that	1
could	1
be	1
mended	1
with	1
a	1
chair.	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
foot	1
too	1
narrow,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
bench	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
was	1
about	1
four	1
inches	1
higher	1
than	1
the	1
planed	1
one--so	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
yoking	1
them.	1
I	1
then	1
placed	1
the	1
first	1
bench	1
lengthwise	1
along	1
the	1
only	1
clear	1
space	1
against	1
the	1
wall,	1
leaving	1
a	1
little	1
interval	1
between,	1
for	1
my	1
back	1
to	1
settle	1
down	1
in.	1
But	1
I	1
soon	1
found	1
that	1
there	1
came	1
such	1
a	1
draught	1
of	1
cold	1
air	1
over	1
me	1
from	1
under	1
the	1
sill	1
of	1
the	1
window,	1
that	1
this	1
plan	1
would	1
never	1
do	1
at	1
all,	1
especially	1
as	1
another	1
current	1
from	1
the	1
rickety	1
door	1
met	1
the	1
one	1
from	1
the	1
window,	1
and	1
both	1
together	1
formed	1
a	1
series	1
of	1
small	1
whirlwinds	1
in	1
the	1
immediate	1
vicinity	1
of	1
the	1
spot	1
where	1
I	1
had	1
thought	1
to	1
spend	1
the	1
night.	1
The	1
devil	1
fetch	1
that	1
harpooneer,	1
thought	1
I,	1
but	1
stop,	1
couldn't	1
I	1
steal	1
a	1
march	1
on	1
him--bolt	1
his	1
door	1
inside,	1
and	1
jump	1
into	1
his	1
bed,	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
wakened	1
by	1
the	1
most	1
violent	1
knockings?	1
It	1
seemed	1
no	1
bad	1
idea;	1
but	1
upon	1
second	1
thoughts	1
I	1
dismissed	1
it.	1
For	1
who	1
could	1
tell	1
but	1
what	1
the	1
next	1
morning,	1
so	1
soon	1
as	1
I	1
popped	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room,	1
the	1
harpooneer	1
might	1
be	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
entry,	1
all	1
ready	1
to	1
knock	1
me	1
down!	1
Still,	1
looking	1
round	1
me	1
again,	1
and	1
seeing	1
no	1
possible	1
chance	1
of	1
spending	1
a	1
sufferable	1
night	1
unless	1
in	1
some	1
other	1
person's	1
bed,	1
I	1
began	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
after	1
all	1
I	1
might	1
be	1
cherishing	1
unwarrantable	1
prejudices	1
against	1
this	1
unknown	1
harpooneer.	1
Thinks	1
I,	1
I'll	1
wait	1
awhile;	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
dropping	1
in	1
before	1
long.	1
I'll	1
have	1
a	1
good	1
look	1
at	1
him	1
then,	1
and	1
perhaps	1
we	1
may	1
become	1
jolly	1
good	1
bedfellows	1
after	1
all--there's	1
no	1
telling.	1
But	1
though	1
the	1
other	1
boarders	1
kept	1
coming	1
in	1
by	1
ones,	1
twos,	1
and	1
threes,	1
and	1
going	1
to	1
bed,	1
yet	1
no	1
sign	1
of	1
my	1
harpooneer.	1
"Landlord!	1
said	1
I,	1
"what	1
sort	1
of	1
a	1
chap	1
is	1
he--does	1
he	1
always	1
keep	1
such	1
late	1
hours?"	1
It	1
was	1
now	1
hard	1
upon	1
twelve	1
o'clock.	1
The	1
landlord	1
chuckled	1
again	1
with	1
his	1
lean	1
chuckle,	1
and	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
mightily	1
tickled	1
at	1
something	1
beyond	1
my	1
comprehension.	1
"No,"	1
he	1
answered,	1
"generally	1
he's	1
an	1
early	1
bird--airley	1
to	1
bed	1
and	1
airley	1
to	1
rise--yes,	1
he's	1
the	1
bird	1
what	1
catches	1
the	1
worm.	1
But	1
to-night	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
a	1
peddling,	1
you	1
see,	1
and	1
I	1
don't	1
see	1
what	1
on	1
airth	1
keeps	1
him	1
so	1
late,	1
unless,	1
may	1
be,	1
he	1
can't	1
sell	1
his	1
head."	1
"Can't	1
sell	1
his	1
head?--What	1
sort	1
of	1
a	1
bamboozingly	1
story	1
is	1
this	1
you	1
are	1
telling	1
me?"	1
getting	1
into	1
a	1
towering	1
rage.	1
"Do	1
you	1
pretend	1
to	1
say,	1
landlord,	1
that	1
this	1
harpooneer	1
is	1
actually	1
engaged	1
this	1
blessed	1
Saturday	1
night,	1
or	1
rather	1
Sunday	1
morning,	1
in	1
peddling	1
his	1
head	1
around	1
this	1
town?"	1
"That's	1
precisely	1
it,"	1
said	1
the	1
landlord,	1
"and	1
I	1
told	1
him	1
he	1
couldn't	1
sell	1
it	1
here,	1
the	1
market's	1
overstocked."	1
"With	1
what?"	1
shouted	1
I.	1
"With	1
heads	1
to	1
be	1
sure;	1
ain't	1
there	1
too	1
many	1
heads	1
in	1
the	1
world?"	1
"I	1
tell	1
you	1
what	1
it	1
is,	1
landlord,"	1
said	1
I	1
quite	1
calmly,	1
"you'd	1
better	1
stop	1
spinning	1
that	1
yarn	1
to	1
me--I'm	1
not	1
green."	1
"May	1
be	1
not,"	1
taking	1
out	1
a	1
stick	1
and	1
whittling	1
a	1
toothpick,	1
"but	1
I	1
rayther	1
guess	1
you'll	1
be	1
done	1
BROWN	1
if	1
that	1
ere	1
harpooneer	1
hears	1
you	1
a	1
slanderin'	1
his	1
head."	1
"I'll	1
break	1
it	1
for	1
him,"	1
said	1
I,	1
now	1
flying	1
into	1
a	1
passion	1
again	1
at	1
this	1
unaccountable	1
farrago	1
of	1
the	1
landlord's.	1
"It's	1
broke	1
a'ready,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"Broke,"	1
said	1
I--"BROKE,	1
do	1
you	1
mean?"	1
"Sartain,	1
and	1
that's	1
the	1
very	1
reason	1
he	1
can't	1
sell	1
it,	1
I	1
guess."	1
"Landlord,"	1
said	1
I,	1
going	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
cool	1
as	1
Mt.	1
Hecla	1
in	1
a	1
snow-storm--"landlord,	1
stop	1
whittling.	1
You	1
and	1
I	1
must	1
understand	1
one	1
another,	1
and	1
that	1
too	1
without	1
delay.	1
I	1
come	1
to	1
your	1
house	1
and	1
want	1
a	1
bed;	1
you	1
tell	1
me	1
you	1
can	1
only	1
give	1
me	1
half	1
a	1
one;	1
that	1
the	1
other	1
half	1
belongs	1
to	1
a	1
certain	1
harpooneer.	1
And	1
about	1
this	1
harpooneer,	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
yet	1
seen,	1
you	1
persist	1
in	1
telling	1
me	1
the	1
most	1
mystifying	1
and	1
exasperating	1
stories	1
tending	1
to	1
beget	1
in	1
me	1
an	1
uncomfortable	1
feeling	1
towards	1
the	1
man	1
whom	1
you	1
design	1
for	1
my	1
bedfellow--a	1
sort	1
of	1
connexion,	1
landlord,	1
which	1
is	1
an	1
intimate	1
and	1
confidential	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
highest	1
degree.	1
I	1
now	1
demand	1
of	1
you	1
to	1
speak	1
out	1
and	1
tell	1
me	1
who	1
and	1
what	1
this	1
harpooneer	1
is,	1
and	1
whether	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
all	1
respects	1
safe	1
to	1
spend	1
the	1
night	1
with	1
him.	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
place,	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
so	1
good	1
as	1
to	1
unsay	1
that	1
story	1
about	1
selling	1
his	1
head,	1
which	1
if	1
true	1
I	1
take	1
to	1
be	1
good	1
evidence	1
that	1
this	1
harpooneer	1
is	1
stark	1
mad,	1
and	1
I've	1
no	1
idea	1
of	1
sleeping	1
with	1
a	1
madman;	1
and	1
you,	1
sir,	1
YOU	1
I	1
mean,	1
landlord,	1
YOU,	1
sir,	1
by	1
trying	1
to	1
induce	1
me	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
knowingly,	1
would	1
thereby	1
render	1
yourself	1
liable	1
to	1
a	1
criminal	1
prosecution."	1
"Wall,"	1
said	1
the	1
landlord,	1
fetching	1
a	1
long	1
breath,	1
"that's	1
a	1
purty	1
long	1
sarmon	1
for	1
a	1
chap	1
that	1
rips	1
a	1
little	1
now	1
and	1
then.	1
But	1
be	1
easy,	1
be	1
easy,	1
this	1
here	1
harpooneer	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
tellin'	1
you	1
of	1
has	1
just	1
arrived	1
from	1
the	1
south	1
seas,	1
where	1
he	1
bought	1
up	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
'balmed	1
New	1
Zealand	1
heads	1
(great	1
curios,	1
you	1
know),	1
and	1
he's	1
sold	1
all	1
on	1
'em	1
but	1
one,	1
and	1
that	1
one	1
he's	1
trying	1
to	1
sell	1
to-night,	1
cause	1
to-morrow's	1
Sunday,	1
and	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
do	1
to	1
be	1
sellin'	1
human	1
heads	1
about	1
the	1
streets	1
when	1
folks	1
is	1
goin'	1
to	1
churches.	1
He	1
wanted	1
to,	1
last	1
Sunday,	1
but	1
I	1
stopped	1
him	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
goin'	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
door	1
with	1
four	1
heads	1
strung	1
on	1
a	1
string,	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
airth	1
like	1
a	1
string	1
of	1
inions."	1
This	1
account	1
cleared	1
up	1
the	1
otherwise	1
unaccountable	1
mystery,	1
and	1
showed	1
that	1
the	1
landlord,	1
after	1
all,	1
had	1
had	1
no	1
idea	1
of	1
fooling	1
me--but	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
what	1
could	1
I	1
think	1
of	1
a	1
harpooneer	1
who	1
stayed	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
Saturday	1
night	1
clean	1
into	1
the	1
holy	1
Sabbath,	1
engaged	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
cannibal	1
business	1
as	1
selling	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
dead	1
idolators?	1
"Depend	1
upon	1
it,	1
landlord,	1
that	1
harpooneer	1
is	1
a	1
dangerous	1
man."	1
"He	1
pays	1
reg'lar,"	1
was	1
the	1
rejoinder.	1
"But	1
come,	1
it's	1
getting	1
dreadful	1
late,	1
you	1
had	1
better	1
be	1
turning	1
flukes--it's	1
a	1
nice	1
bed;	1
Sal	1
and	1
me	1
slept	1
in	1
that	1
ere	1
bed	1
the	1
night	1
we	1
were	1
spliced.	1
There's	1
plenty	1
of	1
room	1
for	1
two	1
to	1
kick	1
about	1
in	1
that	1
bed;	1
it's	1
an	1
almighty	1
big	1
bed	1
that.	1
Why,	1
afore	1
we	1
give	1
it	1
up,	1
Sal	1
used	1
to	1
put	1
our	1
Sam	1
and	1
little	1
Johnny	1
in	1
the	1
foot	1
of	1
it.	1
But	1
I	1
got	1
a	1
dreaming	1
and	1
sprawling	1
about	1
one	1
night,	1
and	1
somehow,	1
Sam	1
got	1
pitched	1
on	1
the	1
floor,	1
and	1
came	1
near	1
breaking	1
his	1
arm.	1
Arter	1
that,	1
Sal	1
said	1
it	1
wouldn't	1
do.	1
Come	1
along	1
here,	1
I'll	1
give	1
ye	1
a	1
glim	1
in	1
a	1
jiffy;"	1
and	1
so	1
saying	1
he	1
lighted	1
a	1
candle	1
and	1
held	1
it	1
towards	1
me,	1
offering	1
to	1
lead	1
the	1
way.	1
But	1
I	1
stood	1
irresolute;	1
when	1
looking	1
at	1
a	1
clock	1
in	1
the	1
corner,	1
he	1
exclaimed	1
"I	1
vum	1
it's	1
Sunday--you	1
won't	1
see	1
that	1
harpooneer	1
to-night;	1
he's	1
come	1
to	1
anchor	1
somewhere--come	1
along	1
then;	1
DO	1
come;	1
WON'T	1
ye	1
come?"	1
I	1
considered	1
the	1
matter	1
a	1
moment,	1
and	1
then	1
up	1
stairs	1
we	1
went,	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
ushered	1
into	1
a	1
small	1
room,	1
cold	1
as	1
a	1
clam,	1
and	1
furnished,	1
sure	1
enough,	1
with	1
a	1
prodigious	1
bed,	1
almost	1
big	1
enough	1
indeed	1
for	1
any	1
four	1
harpooneers	1
to	1
sleep	1
abreast.	1
"There,"	1
said	1
the	1
landlord,	1
placing	1
the	1
candle	1
on	1
a	1
crazy	1
old	1
sea	1
chest	1
that	1
did	1
double	1
duty	1
as	1
a	1
wash-stand	1
and	1
centre	1
table;	1
"there,	1
make	1
yourself	1
comfortable	1
now,	1
and	1
good	1
night	1
to	1
ye."	1
I	1
turned	1
round	1
from	1
eyeing	1
the	1
bed,	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
disappeared.	1
Folding	1
back	1
the	1
counterpane,	1
I	1
stooped	1
over	1
the	1
bed.	1
Though	1
none	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
elegant,	1
it	1
yet	1
stood	1
the	1
scrutiny	1
tolerably	1
well.	1
I	1
then	1
glanced	1
round	1
the	1
room;	1
and	1
besides	1
the	1
bedstead	1
and	1
centre	1
table,	1
could	1
see	1
no	1
other	1
furniture	1
belonging	1
to	1
the	1
place,	1
but	1
a	1
rude	1
shelf,	1
the	1
four	1
walls,	1
and	1
a	1
papered	1
fireboard	1
representing	1
a	1
man	1
striking	1
a	1
whale.	1
Of	1
things	1
not	1
properly	1
belonging	1
to	1
the	1
room,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
hammock	1
lashed	1
up,	1
and	1
thrown	1
upon	1
the	1
floor	1
in	1
one	1
corner;	1
also	1
a	1
large	1
seaman's	1
bag,	1
containing	1
the	1
harpooneer's	1
wardrobe,	1
no	1
doubt	1
in	1
lieu	1
of	1
a	1
land	1
trunk.	1
Likewise,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
parcel	1
of	1
outlandish	1
bone	1
fish	1
hooks	1
on	1
the	1
shelf	1
over	1
the	1
fire-place,	1
and	1
a	1
tall	1
harpoon	1
standing	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
bed.	1
But	1
what	1
is	1
this	1
on	1
the	1
chest?	1
I	1
took	1
it	1
up,	1
and	1
held	1
it	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
light,	1
and	1
felt	1
it,	1
and	1
smelt	1
it,	1
and	1
tried	1
every	1
way	1
possible	1
to	1
arrive	1
at	1
some	1
satisfactory	1
conclusion	1
concerning	1
it.	1
I	1
can	1
compare	1
it	1
to	1
nothing	1
but	1
a	1
large	1
door	1
mat,	1
ornamented	1
at	1
the	1
edges	1
with	1
little	1
tinkling	1
tags	1
something	1
like	1
the	1
stained	1
porcupine	1
quills	1
round	1
an	1
Indian	1
moccasin.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
hole	1
or	1
slit	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
this	1
mat,	1
as	1
you	1
see	1
the	1
same	1
in	1
South	1
American	1
ponchos.	1
But	1
could	1
it	1
be	1
possible	1
that	1
any	1
sober	1
harpooneer	1
would	1
get	1
into	1
a	1
door	1
mat,	1
and	1
parade	1
the	1
streets	1
of	1
any	1
Christian	1
town	1
in	1
that	1
sort	1
of	1
guise?	1
I	1
put	1
it	1
on,	1
to	1
try	1
it,	1
and	1
it	1
weighed	1
me	1
down	1
like	1
a	1
hamper,	1
being	1
uncommonly	1
shaggy	1
and	1
thick,	1
and	1
I	1
thought	1
a	1
little	1
damp,	1
as	1
though	1
this	1
mysterious	1
harpooneer	1
had	1
been	1
wearing	1
it	1
of	1
a	1
rainy	1
day.	1
I	1
went	1
up	1
in	1
it	1
to	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
glass	1
stuck	1
against	1
the	1
wall,	1
and	1
I	1
never	1
saw	1
such	1
a	1
sight	1
in	1
my	1
life.	1
I	1
tore	1
myself	1
out	1
of	1
it	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
hurry	1
that	1
I	1
gave	1
myself	1
a	1
kink	1
in	1
the	1
neck.	1
I	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
bed,	1
and	1
commenced	1
thinking	1
about	1
this	1
head-peddling	1
harpooneer,	1
and	1
his	1
door	1
mat.	1
After	1
thinking	1
some	1
time	1
on	1
the	1
bed-side,	1
I	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
took	1
off	1
my	1
monkey	1
jacket,	1
and	1
then	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
thinking.	1
I	1
then	1
took	1
off	1
my	1
coat,	1
and	1
thought	1
a	1
little	1
more	1
in	1
my	1
shirt	1
sleeves.	1
But	1
beginning	1
to	1
feel	1
very	1
cold	1
now,	1
half	1
undressed	1
as	1
I	1
was,	1
and	1
remembering	1
what	1
the	1
landlord	1
said	1
about	1
the	1
harpooneer's	1
not	1
coming	1
home	1
at	1
all	1
that	1
night,	1
it	1
being	1
so	1
very	1
late,	1
I	1
made	1
no	1
more	1
ado,	1
but	1
jumped	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
pantaloons	1
and	1
boots,	1
and	1
then	1
blowing	1
out	1
the	1
light	1
tumbled	1
into	1
bed,	1
and	1
commended	1
myself	1
to	1
the	1
care	1
of	1
heaven.	1
Whether	1
that	1
mattress	1
was	1
stuffed	1
with	1
corn-cobs	1
or	1
broken	1
crockery,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
telling,	1
but	1
I	1
rolled	1
about	1
a	1
good	1
deal,	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
sleep	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time.	1
At	1
last	1
I	1
slid	1
off	1
into	1
a	1
light	1
doze,	1
and	1
had	1
pretty	1
nearly	1
made	1
a	1
good	1
offing	1
towards	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Nod,	1
when	1
I	1
heard	1
a	1
heavy	1
footfall	1
in	1
the	1
passage,	1
and	1
saw	1
a	1
glimmer	1
of	1
light	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
from	1
under	1
the	1
door.	1
Lord	1
save	1
me,	1
thinks	1
I,	1
that	1
must	1
be	1
the	1
harpooneer,	1
the	1
infernal	1
head-peddler.	1
But	1
I	1
lay	1
perfectly	1
still,	1
and	1
resolved	1
not	1
to	1
say	1
a	1
word	1
till	1
spoken	1
to.	1
Holding	1
a	1
light	1
in	1
one	1
hand,	1
and	1
that	1
identical	1
New	1
Zealand	1
head	1
in	1
the	1
other,	1
the	1
stranger	1
entered	1
the	1
room,	1
and	1
without	1
looking	1
towards	1
the	1
bed,	1
placed	1
his	1
candle	1
a	1
good	1
way	1
off	1
from	1
me	1
on	1
the	1
floor	1
in	1
one	1
corner,	1
and	1
then	1
began	1
working	1
away	1
at	1
the	1
knotted	1
cords	1
of	1
the	1
large	1
bag	1
I	1
before	1
spoke	1
of	1
as	1
being	1
in	1
the	1
room.	1
I	1
was	1
all	1
eagerness	1
to	1
see	1
his	1
face,	1
but	1
he	1
kept	1
it	1
averted	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
while	1
employed	1
in	1
unlacing	1
the	1
bag's	1
mouth.	1
This	1
accomplished,	1
however,	1
he	1
turned	1
round--when,	1
good	1
heavens!	1
what	1
a	1
sight!	1
Such	1
a	1
face!	1
It	1
was	1
of	1
a	1
dark,	1
purplish,	1
yellow	1
colour,	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
stuck	1
over	1
with	1
large	1
blackish	1
looking	1
squares.	1
Yes,	1
it's	1
just	1
as	1
I	1
thought,	1
he's	1
a	1
terrible	1
bedfellow;	1
he's	1
been	1
in	1
a	1
fight,	1
got	1
dreadfully	1
cut,	1
and	1
here	1
he	1
is,	1
just	1
from	1
the	1
surgeon.	1
But	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
he	1
chanced	1
to	1
turn	1
his	1
face	1
so	1
towards	1
the	1
light,	1
that	1
I	1
plainly	1
saw	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
sticking-plasters	1
at	1
all,	1
those	1
black	1
squares	1
on	1
his	1
cheeks.	1
They	1
were	1
stains	1
of	1
some	1
sort	1
or	1
other.	1
At	1
first	1
I	1
knew	1
not	1
what	1
to	1
make	1
of	1
this;	1
but	1
soon	1
an	1
inkling	1
of	1
the	1
truth	1
occurred	1
to	1
me.	1
I	1
remembered	1
a	1
story	1
of	1
a	1
white	1
man--a	1
whaleman	1
too--who,	1
falling	1
among	1
the	1
cannibals,	1
had	1
been	1
tattooed	1
by	1
them.	1
I	1
concluded	1
that	1
this	1
harpooneer,	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
his	1
distant	1
voyages,	1
must	1
have	1
met	1
with	1
a	1
similar	1
adventure.	1
And	1
what	1
is	1
it,	1
thought	1
I,	1
after	1
all!	1
It's	1
only	1
his	1
outside;	1
a	1
man	1
can	1
be	1
honest	1
in	1
any	1
sort	1
of	1
skin.	1
But	1
then,	1
what	1
to	1
make	1
of	1
his	1
unearthly	1
complexion,	1
that	1
part	1
of	1
it,	1
I	1
mean,	1
lying	1
round	1
about,	1
and	1
completely	1
independent	1
of	1
the	1
squares	1
of	1
tattooing.	1
To	1
be	1
sure,	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
nothing	1
but	1
a	1
good	1
coat	1
of	1
tropical	1
tanning;	1
but	1
I	1
never	1
heard	1
of	1
a	1
hot	1
sun's	1
tanning	1
a	1
white	1
man	1
into	1
a	1
purplish	1
yellow	1
one.	1
However,	1
I	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
South	1
Seas;	1
and	1
perhaps	1
the	1
sun	1
there	1
produced	1
these	1
extraordinary	1
effects	1
upon	1
the	1
skin.	1
Now,	1
while	1
all	1
these	1
ideas	1
were	1
passing	1
through	1
me	1
like	1
lightning,	1
this	1
harpooneer	1
never	1
noticed	1
me	1
at	1
all.	1
But,	1
after	1
some	1
difficulty	1
having	1
opened	1
his	1
bag,	1
he	1
commenced	1
fumbling	1
in	1
it,	1
and	1
presently	1
pulled	1
out	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
tomahawk,	1
and	1
a	1
seal-skin	1
wallet	1
with	1
the	1
hair	1
on.	1
Placing	1
these	1
on	1
the	1
old	1
chest	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
room,	1
he	1
then	1
took	1
the	1
New	1
Zealand	1
head--a	1
ghastly	1
thing	1
enough--and	1
crammed	1
it	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
bag.	1
He	1
now	1
took	1
off	1
his	1
hat--a	1
new	1
beaver	1
hat--when	1
I	1
came	1
nigh	1
singing	1
out	1
with	1
fresh	1
surprise.	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
hair	1
on	1
his	1
head--none	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
at	1
least--nothing	1
but	1
a	1
small	1
scalp-knot	1
twisted	1
up	1
on	1
his	1
forehead.	1
His	1
bald	1
purplish	1
head	1
now	1
looked	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
like	1
a	1
mildewed	1
skull.	1
Had	1
not	1
the	1
stranger	1
stood	1
between	1
me	1
and	1
the	1
door,	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
bolted	1
out	1
of	1
it	1
quicker	1
than	1
ever	1
I	1
bolted	1
a	1
dinner.	1
Even	1
as	1
it	1
was,	1
I	1
thought	1
something	1
of	1
slipping	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
second	1
floor	1
back.	1
I	1
am	1
no	1
coward,	1
but	1
what	1
to	1
make	1
of	1
this	1
head-peddling	1
purple	1
rascal	1
altogether	1
passed	1
my	1
comprehension.	1
Ignorance	1
is	1
the	1
parent	1
of	1
fear,	1
and	1
being	1
completely	1
nonplussed	1
and	1
confounded	1
about	1
the	1
stranger,	1
I	1
confess	1
I	1
was	1
now	1
as	1
much	1
afraid	1
of	1
him	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
devil	1
himself	1
who	1
had	1
thus	1
broken	1
into	1
my	1
room	1
at	1
the	1
dead	1
of	1
night.	1
In	1
fact,	1
I	1
was	1
so	1
afraid	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
game	1
enough	1
just	1
then	1
to	1
address	1
him,	1
and	1
demand	1
a	1
satisfactory	1
answer	1
concerning	1
what	1
seemed	1
inexplicable	1
in	1
him.	1
Meanwhile,	1
he	1
continued	1
the	1
business	1
of	1
undressing,	1
and	1
at	1
last	1
showed	1
his	1
chest	1
and	1
arms.	1
As	1
I	1
live,	1
these	1
covered	1
parts	1
of	1
him	1
were	1
checkered	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
squares	1
as	1
his	1
face;	1
his	1
back,	1
too,	1
was	1
all	1
over	1
the	1
same	1
dark	1
squares;	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
a	1
Thirty	1
Years'	1
War,	1
and	1
just	1
escaped	1
from	1
it	1
with	1
a	1
sticking-plaster	1
shirt.	1
Still	1
more,	1
his	1
very	1
legs	1
were	1
marked,	1
as	1
if	1
a	1
parcel	1
of	1
dark	1
green	1
frogs	1
were	1
running	1
up	1
the	1
trunks	1
of	1
young	1
palms.	1
It	1
was	1
now	1
quite	1
plain	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
some	1
abominable	1
savage	1
or	1
other	1
shipped	1
aboard	1
of	1
a	1
whaleman	1
in	1
the	1
South	1
Seas,	1
and	1
so	1
landed	1
in	1
this	1
Christian	1
country.	1
I	1
quaked	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
it.	1
A	1
peddler	1
of	1
heads	1
too--perhaps	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
brothers.	1
He	1
might	1
take	1
a	1
fancy	1
to	1
mine--heavens!	1
look	1
at	1
that	1
tomahawk!	1
But	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
time	1
for	1
shuddering,	1
for	1
now	1
the	1
savage	1
went	1
about	1
something	1
that	1
completely	1
fascinated	1
my	1
attention,	1
and	1
convinced	1
me	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
indeed	1
be	1
a	1
heathen.	1
Going	1
to	1
his	1
heavy	1
grego,	1
or	1
wrapall,	1
or	1
dreadnaught,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
previously	1
hung	1
on	1
a	1
chair,	1
he	1
fumbled	1
in	1
the	1
pockets,	1
and	1
produced	1
at	1
length	1
a	1
curious	1
little	1
deformed	1
image	1
with	1
a	1
hunch	1
on	1
its	1
back,	1
and	1
exactly	1
the	1
colour	1
of	1
a	1
three	1
days'	1
old	1
Congo	1
baby.	1
Remembering	1
the	1
embalmed	1
head,	1
at	1
first	1
I	1
almost	1
thought	1
that	1
this	1
black	1
manikin	1
was	1
a	1
real	1
baby	1
preserved	1
in	1
some	1
similar	1
manner.	1
But	1
seeing	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
limber,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
glistened	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
like	1
polished	1
ebony,	1
I	1
concluded	1
that	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
nothing	1
but	1
a	1
wooden	1
idol,	1
which	1
indeed	1
it	1
proved	1
to	1
be.	1
For	1
now	1
the	1
savage	1
goes	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
empty	1
fire-place,	1
and	1
removing	1
the	1
papered	1
fire-board,	1
sets	1
up	1
this	1
little	1
hunch-backed	1
image,	1
like	1
a	1
tenpin,	1
between	1
the	1
andirons.	1
The	1
chimney	1
jambs	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
bricks	1
inside	1
were	1
very	1
sooty,	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
thought	1
this	1
fire-place	1
made	1
a	1
very	1
appropriate	1
little	1
shrine	1
or	1
chapel	1
for	1
his	1
Congo	1
idol.	1
I	1
now	1
screwed	1
my	1
eyes	1
hard	1
towards	1
the	1
half	1
hidden	1
image,	1
feeling	1
but	1
ill	1
at	1
ease	1
meantime--to	1
see	1
what	1
was	1
next	1
to	1
follow.	1
First	1
he	1
takes	1
about	1
a	1
double	1
handful	1
of	1
shavings	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
grego	1
pocket,	1
and	1
places	1
them	1
carefully	1
before	1
the	1
idol;	1
then	1
laying	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
ship	1
biscuit	1
on	1
top	1
and	1
applying	1
the	1
flame	1
from	1
the	1
lamp,	1
he	1
kindled	1
the	1
shavings	1
into	1
a	1
sacrificial	1
blaze.	1
Presently,	1
after	1
many	1
hasty	1
snatches	1
into	1
the	1
fire,	1
and	1
still	1
hastier	1
withdrawals	1
of	1
his	1
fingers	1
(whereby	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
scorching	1
them	1
badly),	1
he	1
at	1
last	1
succeeded	1
in	1
drawing	1
out	1
the	1
biscuit;	1
then	1
blowing	1
off	1
the	1
heat	1
and	1
ashes	1
a	1
little,	1
he	1
made	1
a	1
polite	1
offer	1
of	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
little	1
negro.	1
But	1
the	1
little	1
devil	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
fancy	1
such	1
dry	1
sort	1
of	1
fare	1
at	1
all;	1
he	1
never	1
moved	1
his	1
lips.	1
All	1
these	1
strange	1
antics	1
were	1
accompanied	1
by	1
still	1
stranger	1
guttural	1
noises	1
from	1
the	1
devotee,	1
who	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
praying	1
in	1
a	1
sing-song	1
or	1
else	1
singing	1
some	1
pagan	1
psalmody	1
or	1
other,	1
during	1
which	1
his	1
face	1
twitched	1
about	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
unnatural	1
manner.	1
At	1
last	1
extinguishing	1
the	1
fire,	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
idol	1
up	1
very	1
unceremoniously,	1
and	1
bagged	1
it	1
again	1
in	1
his	1
grego	1
pocket	1
as	1
carelessly	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
a	1
sportsman	1
bagging	1
a	1
dead	1
woodcock.	1
All	1
these	1
queer	1
proceedings	1
increased	1
my	1
uncomfortableness,	1
and	1
seeing	1
him	1
now	1
exhibiting	1
strong	1
symptoms	1
of	1
concluding	1
his	1
business	1
operations,	1
and	1
jumping	1
into	1
bed	1
with	1
me,	1
I	1
thought	1
it	1
was	1
high	1
time,	1
now	1
or	1
never,	1
before	1
the	1
light	1
was	1
put	1
out,	1
to	1
break	1
the	1
spell	1
in	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
so	1
long	1
been	1
bound.	1
But	1
the	1
interval	1
I	1
spent	1
in	1
deliberating	1
what	1
to	1
say,	1
was	1
a	1
fatal	1
one.	1
Taking	1
up	1
his	1
tomahawk	1
from	1
the	1
table,	1
he	1
examined	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
it	1
for	1
an	1
instant,	1
and	1
then	1
holding	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
light,	1
with	1
his	1
mouth	1
at	1
the	1
handle,	1
he	1
puffed	1
out	1
great	1
clouds	1
of	1
tobacco	1
smoke.	1
The	1
next	1
moment	1
the	1
light	1
was	1
extinguished,	1
and	1
this	1
wild	1
cannibal,	1
tomahawk	1
between	1
his	1
teeth,	1
sprang	1
into	1
bed	1
with	1
me.	1
I	1
sang	1
out,	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
it	1
now;	1
and	1
giving	1
a	1
sudden	1
grunt	1
of	1
astonishment	1
he	1
began	1
feeling	1
me.	1
Stammering	1
out	1
something,	1
I	1
knew	1
not	1
what,	1
I	1
rolled	1
away	1
from	1
him	1
against	1
the	1
wall,	1
and	1
then	1
conjured	1
him,	1
whoever	1
or	1
whatever	1
he	1
might	1
be,	1
to	1
keep	1
quiet,	1
and	1
let	1
me	1
get	1
up	1
and	1
light	1
the	1
lamp	1
again.	1
But	1
his	1
guttural	1
responses	1
satisfied	1
me	1
at	1
once	1
that	1
he	1
but	1
ill	1
comprehended	1
my	1
meaning.	1
"Who-e	1
debel	1
you?"--he	1
at	1
last	1
said--"you	1
no	1
speak-e,	1
dam-me,	1
I	1
kill-e."	1
And	1
so	1
saying	1
the	1
lighted	1
tomahawk	1
began	1
flourishing	1
about	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
dark.	1
"Landlord,	1
for	1
God's	1
sake,	1
Peter	1
Coffin!"	1
shouted	1
I.	1
"Landlord!	1
Watch!	1
Coffin!	1
Angels!	1
save	1
me!"	1
"Speak-e!	1
tell-ee	1
me	1
who-ee	1
be,	1
or	1
dam-me,	1
I	1
kill-e!"	1
again	1
growled	1
the	1
cannibal,	1
while	1
his	1
horrid	1
flourishings	1
of	1
the	1
tomahawk	1
scattered	1
the	1
hot	1
tobacco	1
ashes	1
about	1
me	1
till	1
I	1
thought	1
my	1
linen	1
would	1
get	1
on	1
fire.	1
But	1
thank	1
heaven,	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
the	1
landlord	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
light	1
in	1
hand,	1
and	1
leaping	1
from	1
the	1
bed	1
I	1
ran	1
up	1
to	1
him.	1
"Don't	1
be	1
afraid	1
now,"	1
said	1
he,	1
grinning	1
again,	1
"Queequeg	1
here	1
wouldn't	1
harm	1
a	1
hair	1
of	1
your	1
head."	1
"Stop	1
your	1
grinning,"	1
shouted	1
I,	1
"and	1
why	1
didn't	1
you	1
tell	1
me	1
that	1
that	1
infernal	1
harpooneer	1
was	1
a	1
cannibal?"	1
"I	1
thought	1
ye	1
know'd	1
it;--didn't	1
I	1
tell	1
ye,	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
peddlin'	1
heads	1
around	1
town?--but	1
turn	1
flukes	1
again	1
and	1
go	1
to	1
sleep.	1
Queequeg,	1
look	1
here--you	1
sabbee	1
me,	1
I	1
sabbee--you	1
this	1
man	1
sleepe	1
you--you	1
sabbee?"	1
"Me	1
sabbee	1
plenty"--grunted	1
Queequeg,	1
puffing	1
away	1
at	1
his	1
pipe	1
and	1
sitting	1
up	1
in	1
bed.	1
"You	1
gettee	1
in,"	1
he	1
added,	1
motioning	1
to	1
me	1
with	1
his	1
tomahawk,	1
and	1
throwing	1
the	1
clothes	1
to	1
one	1
side.	1
He	1
really	1
did	1
this	1
in	1
not	1
only	1
a	1
civil	1
but	1
a	1
really	1
kind	1
and	1
charitable	1
way.	1
I	1
stood	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
a	1
moment.	1
For	1
all	1
his	1
tattooings	1
he	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
whole	1
a	1
clean,	1
comely	1
looking	1
cannibal.	1
What's	1
all	1
this	1
fuss	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
making	1
about,	1
thought	1
I	1
to	1
myself--the	1
man's	1
a	1
human	1
being	1
just	1
as	1
I	1
am:	1
he	1
has	1
just	1
as	1
much	1
reason	1
to	1
fear	1
me,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
be	1
afraid	1
of	1
him.	1
Better	1
sleep	1
with	1
a	1
sober	1
cannibal	1
than	1
a	1
drunken	1
Christian.	1
"Landlord,"	1
said	1
I,	1
"tell	1
him	1
to	1
stash	1
his	1
tomahawk	1
there,	1
or	1
pipe,	1
or	1
whatever	1
you	1
call	1
it;	1
tell	1
him	1
to	1
stop	1
smoking,	1
in	1
short,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
turn	1
in	1
with	1
him.	1
But	1
I	1
don't	1
fancy	1
having	1
a	1
man	1
smoking	1
in	1
bed	1
with	1
me.	1
It's	1
dangerous.	1
Besides,	1
I	1
ain't	1
insured."	1
This	1
being	1
told	1
to	1
Queequeg,	1
he	1
at	1
once	1
complied,	1
and	1
again	1
politely	1
motioned	1
me	1
to	1
get	1
into	1
bed--rolling	1
over	1
to	1
one	1
side	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
to	1
say--I	1
won't	1
touch	1
a	1
leg	1
of	1
ye."	1
"Good	1
night,	1
landlord,"	1
said	1
I,	1
"you	1
may	1
go."	1
I	1
turned	1
in,	1
and	1
never	1
slept	1
better	1
in	1
my	1
life.	1
CHAPTER	1
4	1
The	1
Counterpane.	1
Upon	1
waking	1
next	1
morning	1
about	1
daylight,	1
I	1
found	1
Queequeg's	1
arm	1
thrown	1
over	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
loving	1
and	1
affectionate	1
manner.	1
You	1
had	1
almost	1
thought	1
I	1
had	1
been	1
his	1
wife.	1
The	1
counterpane	1
was	1
of	1
patchwork,	1
full	1
of	1
odd	1
little	1
parti-coloured	1
squares	1
and	1
triangles;	1
and	1
this	1
arm	1
of	1
his	1
tattooed	1
all	1
over	1
with	1
an	1
interminable	1
Cretan	1
labyrinth	1
of	1
a	1
figure,	1
no	1
two	1
parts	1
of	1
which	1
were	1
of	1
one	1
precise	1
shade--owing	1
I	1
suppose	1
to	1
his	1
keeping	1
his	1
arm	1
at	1
sea	1
unmethodically	1
in	1
sun	1
and	1
shade,	1
his	1
shirt	1
sleeves	1
irregularly	1
rolled	1
up	1
at	1
various	1
times--this	1
same	1
arm	1
of	1
his,	1
I	1
say,	1
looked	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
like	1
a	1
strip	1
of	1
that	1
same	1
patchwork	1
quilt.	1
Indeed,	1
partly	1
lying	1
on	1
it	1
as	1
the	1
arm	1
did	1
when	1
I	1
first	1
awoke,	1
I	1
could	1
hardly	1
tell	1
it	1
from	1
the	1
quilt,	1
they	1
so	1
blended	1
their	1
hues	1
together;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
by	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
weight	1
and	1
pressure	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
tell	1
that	1
Queequeg	1
was	1
hugging	1
me.	1
My	1
sensations	1
were	1
strange.	1
Let	1
me	1
try	1
to	1
explain	1
them.	1
When	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
child,	1
I	1
well	1
remember	1
a	1
somewhat	1
similar	1
circumstance	1
that	1
befell	1
me;	1
whether	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
reality	1
or	1
a	1
dream,	1
I	1
never	1
could	1
entirely	1
settle.	1
The	1
circumstance	1
was	1
this.	1
I	1
had	1
been	1
cutting	1
up	1
some	1
caper	1
or	1
other--I	1
think	1
it	1
was	1
trying	1
to	1
crawl	1
up	1
the	1
chimney,	1
as	1
I	1
had	1
seen	1
a	1
little	1
sweep	1
do	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
previous;	1
and	1
my	1
stepmother	1
who,	1
somehow	1
or	1
other,	1
was	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
whipping	1
me,	1
or	1
sending	1
me	1
to	1
bed	1
supperless,--my	1
mother	1
dragged	1
me	1
by	1
the	1
legs	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
chimney	1
and	1
packed	1
me	1
off	1
to	1
bed,	1
though	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
two	1
o'clock	1
in	1
the	1
afternoon	1
of	1
the	1
21st	1
June,	1
the	1
longest	1
day	1
in	1
the	1
year	1
in	1
our	1
hemisphere.	1
I	1
felt	1
dreadfully.	1
But	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
help	1
for	1
it,	1
so	1
up	1
stairs	1
I	1
went	1
to	1
my	1
little	1
room	1
in	1
the	1
third	1
floor,	1
undressed	1
myself	1
as	1
slowly	1
as	1
possible	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
kill	1
time,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
bitter	1
sigh	1
got	1
between	1
the	1
sheets.	1
I	1
lay	1
there	1
dismally	1
calculating	1
that	1
sixteen	1
entire	1
hours	1
must	1
elapse	1
before	1
I	1
could	1
hope	1
for	1
a	1
resurrection.	1
Sixteen	1
hours	1
in	1
bed!	1
the	1
small	1
of	1
my	1
back	1
ached	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
it.	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
light	1
too;	1
the	1
sun	1
shining	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
window,	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
rattling	1
of	1
coaches	1
in	1
the	1
streets,	1
and	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
gay	1
voices	1
all	1
over	1
the	1
house.	1
I	1
felt	1
worse	1
and	1
worse--at	1
last	1
I	1
got	1
up,	1
dressed,	1
and	1
softly	1
going	1
down	1
in	1
my	1
stockinged	1
feet,	1
sought	1
out	1
my	1
stepmother,	1
and	1
suddenly	1
threw	1
myself	1
at	1
her	1
feet,	1
beseeching	1
her	1
as	1
a	1
particular	1
favour	1
to	1
give	1
me	1
a	1
good	1
slippering	1
for	1
my	1
misbehaviour;	1
anything	1
indeed	1
but	1
condemning	1
me	1
to	1
lie	1
abed	1
such	1
an	1
unendurable	1
length	1
of	1
time.	1
But	1
she	1
was	1
the	1
best	1
and	1
most	1
conscientious	1
of	1
stepmothers,	1
and	1
back	1
I	1
had	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
my	1
room.	1
For	1
several	1
hours	1
I	1
lay	1
there	1
broad	1
awake,	1
feeling	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
worse	1
than	1
I	1
have	1
ever	1
done	1
since,	1
even	1
from	1
the	1
greatest	1
subsequent	1
misfortunes.	1
At	1
last	1
I	1
must	1
have	1
fallen	1
into	1
a	1
troubled	1
nightmare	1
of	1
a	1
doze;	1
and	1
slowly	1
waking	1
from	1
it--half	1
steeped	1
in	1
dreams--I	1
opened	1
my	1
eyes,	1
and	1
the	1
before	1
sun-lit	1
room	1
was	1
now	1
wrapped	1
in	1
outer	1
darkness.	1
Instantly	1
I	1
felt	1
a	1
shock	1
running	1
through	1
all	1
my	1
frame;	1
nothing	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
seen,	1
and	1
nothing	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
heard;	1
but	1
a	1
supernatural	1
hand	1
seemed	1
placed	1
in	1
mine.	1
My	1
arm	1
hung	1
over	1
the	1
counterpane,	1
and	1
the	1
nameless,	1
unimaginable,	1
silent	1
form	1
or	1
phantom,	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
hand	1
belonged,	1
seemed	1
closely	1
seated	1
by	1
my	1
bed-side.	1
For	1
what	1
seemed	1
ages	1
piled	1
on	1
ages,	1
I	1
lay	1
there,	1
frozen	1
with	1
the	1
most	1
awful	1
fears,	1
not	1
daring	1
to	1
drag	1
away	1
my	1
hand;	1
yet	1
ever	1
thinking	1
that	1
if	1
I	1
could	1
but	1
stir	1
it	1
one	1
single	1
inch,	1
the	1
horrid	1
spell	1
would	1
be	1
broken.	1
I	1
knew	1
not	1
how	1
this	1
consciousness	1
at	1
last	1
glided	1
away	1
from	1
me;	1
but	1
waking	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
I	1
shudderingly	1
remembered	1
it	1
all,	1
and	1
for	1
days	1
and	1
weeks	1
and	1
months	1
afterwards	1
I	1
lost	1
myself	1
in	1
confounding	1
attempts	1
to	1
explain	1
the	1
mystery.	1
Nay,	1
to	1
this	1
very	1
hour,	1
I	1
often	1
puzzle	1
myself	1
with	1
it.	1
Now,	1
take	1
away	1
the	1
awful	1
fear,	1
and	1
my	1
sensations	1
at	1
feeling	1
the	1
supernatural	1
hand	1
in	1
mine	1
were	1
very	1
similar,	1
in	1
their	1
strangeness,	1
to	1
those	1
which	1
I	1
experienced	1
on	1
waking	1
up	1
and	1
seeing	1
Queequeg's	1
pagan	1
arm	1
thrown	1
round	1
me.	1
But	1
at	1
length	1
all	1
the	1
past	1
night's	1
events	1
soberly	1
recurred,	1
one	1
by	1
one,	1
in	1
fixed	1
reality,	1
and	1
then	1
I	1
lay	1
only	1
alive	1
to	1
the	1
comical	1
predicament.	1
For	1
though	1
I	1
tried	1
to	1
move	1
his	1
arm--unlock	1
his	1
bridegroom	1
clasp--yet,	1
sleeping	1
as	1
he	1
was,	1
he	1
still	1
hugged	1
me	1
tightly,	1
as	1
though	1
naught	1
but	1
death	1
should	1
part	1
us	1
twain.	1
I	1
now	1
strove	1
to	1
rouse	1
him--"Queequeg!"--but	1
his	1
only	1
answer	1
was	1
a	1
snore.	1
I	1
then	1
rolled	1
over,	1
my	1
neck	1
feeling	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
in	1
a	1
horse-collar;	1
and	1
suddenly	1
felt	1
a	1
slight	1
scratch.	1
Throwing	1
aside	1
the	1
counterpane,	1
there	1
lay	1
the	1
tomahawk	1
sleeping	1
by	1
the	1
savage's	1
side,	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
hatchet-faced	1
baby.	1
A	1
pretty	1
pickle,	1
truly,	1
thought	1
I;	1
abed	1
here	1
in	1
a	1
strange	1
house	1
in	1
the	1
broad	1
day,	1
with	1
a	1
cannibal	1
and	1
a	1
tomahawk!	1
"Queequeg!--in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
goodness,	1
Queequeg,	1
wake!"	1
At	1
length,	1
by	1
dint	1
of	1
much	1
wriggling,	1
and	1
loud	1
and	1
incessant	1
expostulations	1
upon	1
the	1
unbecomingness	1
of	1
his	1
hugging	1
a	1
fellow	1
male	1
in	1
that	1
matrimonial	1
sort	1
of	1
style,	1
I	1
succeeded	1
in	1
extracting	1
a	1
grunt;	1
and	1
presently,	1
he	1
drew	1
back	1
his	1
arm,	1
shook	1
himself	1
all	1
over	1
like	1
a	1
Newfoundland	1
dog	1
just	1
from	1
the	1
water,	1
and	1
sat	1
up	1
in	1
bed,	1
stiff	1
as	1
a	1
pike-staff,	1
looking	1
at	1
me,	1
and	1
rubbing	1
his	1
eyes	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
altogether	1
remember	1
how	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
be	1
there,	1
though	1
a	1
dim	1
consciousness	1
of	1
knowing	1
something	1
about	1
me	1
seemed	1
slowly	1
dawning	1
over	1
him.	1
Meanwhile,	1
I	1
lay	1
quietly	1
eyeing	1
him,	1
having	1
no	1
serious	1
misgivings	1
now,	1
and	1
bent	1
upon	1
narrowly	1
observing	1
so	1
curious	1
a	1
creature.	1
When,	1
at	1
last,	1
his	1
mind	1
seemed	1
made	1
up	1
touching	1
the	1
character	1
of	1
his	1
bedfellow,	1
and	1
he	1
became,	1
as	1
it	1
were,	1
reconciled	1
to	1
the	1
fact;	1
he	1
jumped	1
out	1
upon	1
the	1
floor,	1
and	1
by	1
certain	1
signs	1
and	1
sounds	1
gave	1
me	1
to	1
understand	1
that,	1
if	1
it	1
pleased	1
me,	1
he	1
would	1
dress	1
first	1
and	1
then	1
leave	1
me	1
to	1
dress	1
afterwards,	1
leaving	1
the	1
whole	1
apartment	1
to	1
myself.	1
Thinks	1
I,	1
Queequeg,	1
under	1
the	1
circumstances,	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
civilized	1
overture;	1
but,	1
the	1
truth	1
is,	1
these	1
savages	1
have	1
an	1
innate	1
sense	1
of	1
delicacy,	1
say	1
what	1
you	1
will;	1
it	1
is	1
marvellous	1
how	1
essentially	1
polite	1
they	1
are.	1
I	1
pay	1
this	1
particular	1
compliment	1
to	1
Queequeg,	1
because	1
he	1
treated	1
me	1
with	1
so	1
much	1
civility	1
and	1
consideration,	1
while	1
I	1
was	1
guilty	1
of	1
great	1
rudeness;	1
staring	1
at	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
bed,	1
and	1
watching	1
all	1
his	1
toilette	1
motions;	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
my	1
curiosity	1
getting	1
the	1
better	1
of	1
my	1
breeding.	1
Nevertheless,	1
a	1
man	1
like	1
Queequeg	1
you	1
don't	1
see	1
every	1
day,	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
ways	1
were	1
well	1
worth	1
unusual	1
regarding.	1
He	1
commenced	1
dressing	1
at	1
top	1
by	1
donning	1
his	1
beaver	1
hat,	1
a	1
very	1
tall	1
one,	1
by	1
the	1
by,	1
and	1
then--still	1
minus	1
his	1
trowsers--he	1
hunted	1
up	1
his	1
boots.	1
What	1
under	1
the	1
heavens	1
he	1
did	1
it	1
for,	1
I	1
cannot	1
tell,	1
but	1
his	1
next	1
movement	1
was	1
to	1
crush	1
himself--boots	1
in	1
hand,	1
and	1
hat	1
on--under	1
the	1
bed;	1
when,	1
from	1
sundry	1
violent	1
gaspings	1
and	1
strainings,	1
I	1
inferred	1
he	1
was	1
hard	1
at	1
work	1
booting	1
himself;	1
though	1
by	1
no	1
law	1
of	1
propriety	1
that	1
I	1
ever	1
heard	1
of,	1
is	1
any	1
man	1
required	1
to	1
be	1
private	1
when	1
putting	1
on	1
his	1
boots.	1
But	1
Queequeg,	1
do	1
you	1
see,	1
was	1
a	1
creature	1
in	1
the	1
transition	1
stage--neither	1
caterpillar	1
nor	1
butterfly.	1
He	1
was	1
just	1
enough	1
civilized	1
to	1
show	1
off	1
his	1
outlandishness	1
in	1
the	1
strangest	1
possible	1
manners.	1
His	1
education	1
was	1
not	1
yet	1
completed.	1
He	1
was	1
an	1
undergraduate.	1
If	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
a	1
small	1
degree	1
civilized,	1
he	1
very	1
probably	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
troubled	1
himself	1
with	1
boots	1
at	1
all;	1
but	1
then,	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
still	1
a	1
savage,	1
he	1
never	1
would	1
have	1
dreamt	1
of	1
getting	1
under	1
the	1
bed	1
to	1
put	1
them	1
on.	1
At	1
last,	1
he	1
emerged	1
with	1
his	1
hat	1
very	1
much	1
dented	1
and	1
crushed	1
down	1
over	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
began	1
creaking	1
and	1
limping	1
about	1
the	1
room,	1
as	1
if,	1
not	1
being	1
much	1
accustomed	1
to	1
boots,	1
his	1
pair	1
of	1
damp,	1
wrinkled	1
cowhide	1
ones--probably	1
not	1
made	1
to	1
order	1
either--rather	1
pinched	1
and	1
tormented	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
go	1
off	1
of	1
a	1
bitter	1
cold	1
morning.	1
Seeing,	1
now,	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
curtains	1
to	1
the	1
window,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
street	1
being	1
very	1
narrow,	1
the	1
house	1
opposite	1
commanded	1
a	1
plain	1
view	1
into	1
the	1
room,	1
and	1
observing	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
the	1
indecorous	1
figure	1
that	1
Queequeg	1
made,	1
staving	1
about	1
with	1
little	1
else	1
but	1
his	1
hat	1
and	1
boots	1
on;	1
I	1
begged	1
him	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
I	1
could,	1
to	1
accelerate	1
his	1
toilet	1
somewhat,	1
and	1
particularly	1
to	1
get	1
into	1
his	1
pantaloons	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
possible.	1
He	1
complied,	1
and	1
then	1
proceeded	1
to	1
wash	1
himself.	1
At	1
that	1
time	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
any	1
Christian	1
would	1
have	1
washed	1
his	1
face;	1
but	1
Queequeg,	1
to	1
my	1
amazement,	1
contented	1
himself	1
with	1
restricting	1
his	1
ablutions	1
to	1
his	1
chest,	1
arms,	1
and	1
hands.	1
He	1
then	1
donned	1
his	1
waistcoat,	1
and	1
taking	1
up	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
hard	1
soap	1
on	1
the	1
wash-stand	1
centre	1
table,	1
dipped	1
it	1
into	1
water	1
and	1
commenced	1
lathering	1
his	1
face.	1
I	1
was	1
watching	1
to	1
see	1
where	1
he	1
kept	1
his	1
razor,	1
when	1
lo	1
and	1
behold,	1
he	1
takes	1
the	1
harpoon	1
from	1
the	1
bed	1
corner,	1
slips	1
out	1
the	1
long	1
wooden	1
stock,	1
unsheathes	1
the	1
head,	1
whets	1
it	1
a	1
little	1
on	1
his	1
boot,	1
and	1
striding	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
bit	1
of	1
mirror	1
against	1
the	1
wall,	1
begins	1
a	1
vigorous	1
scraping,	1
or	1
rather	1
harpooning	1
of	1
his	1
cheeks.	1
Thinks	1
I,	1
Queequeg,	1
this	1
is	1
using	1
Rogers's	1
best	1
cutlery	1
with	1
a	1
vengeance.	1
Afterwards	1
I	1
wondered	1
the	1
less	1
at	1
this	1
operation	1
when	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
know	1
of	1
what	1
fine	1
steel	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
a	1
harpoon	1
is	1
made,	1
and	1
how	1
exceedingly	1
sharp	1
the	1
long	1
straight	1
edges	1
are	1
always	1
kept.	1
The	1
rest	1
of	1
his	1
toilet	1
was	1
soon	1
achieved,	1
and	1
he	1
proudly	1
marched	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room,	1
wrapped	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
great	1
pilot	1
monkey	1
jacket,	1
and	1
sporting	1
his	1
harpoon	1
like	1
a	1
marshal's	1
baton.	1
CHAPTER	1
5	1
Breakfast.	1
I	1
quickly	1
followed	1
suit,	1
and	1
descending	1
into	1
the	1
bar-room	1
accosted	1
the	1
grinning	1
landlord	1
very	1
pleasantly.	1
I	1
cherished	1
no	1
malice	1
towards	1
him,	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
skylarking	1
with	1
me	1
not	1
a	1
little	1
in	1
the	1
matter	1
of	1
my	1
bedfellow.	1
However,	1
a	1
good	1
laugh	1
is	1
a	1
mighty	1
good	1
thing,	1
and	1
rather	1
too	1
scarce	1
a	1
good	1
thing;	1
the	1
more's	1
the	1
pity.	1
So,	1
if	1
any	1
one	1
man,	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
proper	1
person,	1
afford	1
stuff	1
for	1
a	1
good	1
joke	1
to	1
anybody,	1
let	1
him	1
not	1
be	1
backward,	1
but	1
let	1
him	1
cheerfully	1
allow	1
himself	1
to	1
spend	1
and	1
be	1
spent	1
in	1
that	1
way.	1
And	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
has	1
anything	1
bountifully	1
laughable	1
about	1
him,	1
be	1
sure	1
there	1
is	1
more	1
in	1
that	1
man	1
than	1
you	1
perhaps	1
think	1
for.	1
The	1
bar-room	1
was	1
now	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
boarders	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
dropping	1
in	1
the	1
night	1
previous,	1
and	1
whom	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
as	1
yet	1
had	1
a	1
good	1
look	1
at.	1
They	1
were	1
nearly	1
all	1
whalemen;	1
chief	1
mates,	1
and	1
second	1
mates,	1
and	1
third	1
mates,	1
and	1
sea	1
carpenters,	1
and	1
sea	1
coopers,	1
and	1
sea	1
blacksmiths,	1
and	1
harpooneers,	1
and	1
ship	1
keepers;	1
a	1
brown	1
and	1
brawny	1
company,	1
with	1
bosky	1
beards;	1
an	1
unshorn,	1
shaggy	1
set,	1
all	1
wearing	1
monkey	1
jackets	1
for	1
morning	1
gowns.	1
You	1
could	1
pretty	1
plainly	1
tell	1
how	1
long	1
each	1
one	1
had	1
been	1
ashore.	1
This	1
young	1
fellow's	1
healthy	1
cheek	1
is	1
like	1
a	1
sun-toasted	1
pear	1
in	1
hue,	1
and	1
would	1
seem	1
to	1
smell	1
almost	1
as	1
musky;	1
he	1
cannot	1
have	1
been	1
three	1
days	1
landed	1
from	1
his	1
Indian	1
voyage.	1
That	1
man	1
next	1
him	1
looks	1
a	1
few	1
shades	1
lighter;	1
you	1
might	1
say	1
a	1
touch	1
of	1
satin	1
wood	1
is	1
in	1
him.	1
In	1
the	1
complexion	1
of	1
a	1
third	1
still	1
lingers	1
a	1
tropic	1
tawn,	1
but	1
slightly	1
bleached	1
withal;	1
HE	1
doubtless	1
has	1
tarried	1
whole	1
weeks	1
ashore.	1
But	1
who	1
could	1
show	1
a	1
cheek	1
like	1
Queequeg?	1
which,	1
barred	1
with	1
various	1
tints,	1
seemed	1
like	1
the	1
Andes'	1
western	1
slope,	1
to	1
show	1
forth	1
in	1
one	1
array,	1
contrasting	1
climates,	1
zone	1
by	1
zone.	1
"Grub,	1
ho!"	1
now	1
cried	1
the	1
landlord,	1
flinging	1
open	1
a	1
door,	1
and	1
in	1
we	1
went	1
to	1
breakfast.	1
They	1
say	1
that	1
men	1
who	1
have	1
seen	1
the	1
world,	1
thereby	1
become	1
quite	1
at	1
ease	1
in	1
manner,	1
quite	1
self-possessed	1
in	1
company.	1
Not	1
always,	1
though:	1
Ledyard,	1
the	1
great	1
New	1
England	1
traveller,	1
and	1
Mungo	1
Park,	1
the	1
Scotch	1
one;	1
of	1
all	1
men,	1
they	1
possessed	1
the	1
least	1
assurance	1
in	1
the	1
parlor.	1
But	1
perhaps	1
the	1
mere	1
crossing	1
of	1
Siberia	1
in	1
a	1
sledge	1
drawn	1
by	1
dogs	1
as	1
Ledyard	1
did,	1
or	1
the	1
taking	1
a	1
long	1
solitary	1
walk	1
on	1
an	1
empty	1
stomach,	1
in	1
the	1
negro	1
heart	1
of	1
Africa,	1
which	1
was	1
the	1
sum	1
of	1
poor	1
Mungo's	1
performances--this	1
kind	1
of	1
travel,	1
I	1
say,	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
the	1
very	1
best	1
mode	1
of	1
attaining	1
a	1
high	1
social	1
polish.	1
Still,	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
part,	1
that	1
sort	1
of	1
thing	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
had	1
anywhere.	1
These	1
reflections	1
just	1
here	1
are	1
occasioned	1
by	1
the	1
circumstance	1
that	1
after	1
we	1
were	1
all	1
seated	1
at	1
the	1
table,	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
preparing	1
to	1
hear	1
some	1
good	1
stories	1
about	1
whaling;	1
to	1
my	1
no	1
small	1
surprise,	1
nearly	1
every	1
man	1
maintained	1
a	1
profound	1
silence.	1
And	1
not	1
only	1
that,	1
but	1
they	1
looked	1
embarrassed.	1
Yes,	1
here	1
were	1
a	1
set	1
of	1
sea-dogs,	1
many	1
of	1
whom	1
without	1
the	1
slightest	1
bashfulness	1
had	1
boarded	1
great	1
whales	1
on	1
the	1
high	1
seas--entire	1
strangers	1
to	1
them--and	1
duelled	1
them	1
dead	1
without	1
winking;	1
and	1
yet,	1
here	1
they	1
sat	1
at	1
a	1
social	1
breakfast	1
table--all	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
calling,	1
all	1
of	1
kindred	1
tastes--looking	1
round	1
as	1
sheepishly	1
at	1
each	1
other	1
as	1
though	1
they	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
out	1
of	1
sight	1
of	1
some	1
sheepfold	1
among	1
the	1
Green	1
Mountains.	1
A	1
curious	1
sight;	1
these	1
bashful	1
bears,	1
these	1
timid	1
warrior	1
whalemen!	1
But	1
as	1
for	1
Queequeg--why,	1
Queequeg	1
sat	1
there	1
among	1
them--at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
table,	1
too,	1
it	1
so	1
chanced;	1
as	1
cool	1
as	1
an	1
icicle.	1
To	1
be	1
sure	1
I	1
cannot	1
say	1
much	1
for	1
his	1
breeding.	1
His	1
greatest	1
admirer	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
cordially	1
justified	1
his	1
bringing	1
his	1
harpoon	1
into	1
breakfast	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
using	1
it	1
there	1
without	1
ceremony;	1
reaching	1
over	1
the	1
table	1
with	1
it,	1
to	1
the	1
imminent	1
jeopardy	1
of	1
many	1
heads,	1
and	1
grappling	1
the	1
beefsteaks	1
towards	1
him.	1
But	1
THAT	1
was	1
certainly	1
very	1
coolly	1
done	1
by	1
him,	1
and	1
every	1
one	1
knows	1
that	1
in	1
most	1
people's	1
estimation,	1
to	1
do	1
anything	1
coolly	1
is	1
to	1
do	1
it	1
genteelly.	1
We	1
will	1
not	1
speak	1
of	1
all	1
Queequeg's	1
peculiarities	1
here;	1
how	1
he	1
eschewed	1
coffee	1
and	1
hot	1
rolls,	1
and	1
applied	1
his	1
undivided	1
attention	1
to	1
beefsteaks,	1
done	1
rare.	1
Enough,	1
that	1
when	1
breakfast	1
was	1
over	1
he	1
withdrew	1
like	1
the	1
rest	1
into	1
the	1
public	1
room,	1
lighted	1
his	1
tomahawk-pipe,	1
and	1
was	1
sitting	1
there	1
quietly	1
digesting	1
and	1
smoking	1
with	1
his	1
inseparable	1
hat	1
on,	1
when	1
I	1
sallied	1
out	1
for	1
a	1
stroll.	1
CHAPTER	1
6	1
The	1
Street.	1
If	1
I	1
had	1
been	1
astonished	1
at	1
first	1
catching	1
a	1
glimpse	1
of	1
so	1
outlandish	1
an	1
individual	1
as	1
Queequeg	1
circulating	1
among	1
the	1
polite	1
society	1
of	1
a	1
civilized	1
town,	1
that	1
astonishment	1
soon	1
departed	1
upon	1
taking	1
my	1
first	1
daylight	1
stroll	1
through	1
the	1
streets	1
of	1
New	1
Bedford.	1
In	1
thoroughfares	1
nigh	1
the	1
docks,	1
any	1
considerable	1
seaport	1
will	1
frequently	1
offer	1
to	1
view	1
the	1
queerest	1
looking	1
nondescripts	1
from	1
foreign	1
parts.	1
Even	1
in	1
Broadway	1
and	1
Chestnut	1
streets,	1
Mediterranean	1
mariners	1
will	1
sometimes	1
jostle	1
the	1
affrighted	1
ladies.	1
Regent	1
Street	1
is	1
not	1
unknown	1
to	1
Lascars	1
and	1
Malays;	1
and	1
at	1
Bombay,	1
in	1
the	1
Apollo	1
Green,	1
live	1
Yankees	1
have	1
often	1
scared	1
the	1
natives.	1
But	1
New	1
Bedford	1
beats	1
all	1
Water	1
Street	1
and	1
Wapping.	1
In	1
these	1
last-mentioned	1
haunts	1
you	1
see	1
only	1
sailors;	1
but	1
in	1
New	1
Bedford,	1
actual	1
cannibals	1
stand	1
chatting	1
at	1
street	1
corners;	1
savages	1
outright;	1
many	1
of	1
whom	1
yet	1
carry	1
on	1
their	1
bones	1
unholy	1
flesh.	1
It	1
makes	1
a	1
stranger	1
stare.	1
But,	1
besides	1
the	1
Feegeeans,	1
Tongatobooarrs,	1
Erromanggoans,	1
Pannangians,	1
and	1
Brighggians,	1
and,	1
besides	1
the	1
wild	1
specimens	1
of	1
the	1
whaling-craft	1
which	1
unheeded	1
reel	1
about	1
the	1
streets,	1
you	1
will	1
see	1
other	1
sights	1
still	1
more	1
curious,	1
certainly	1
more	1
comical.	1
There	1
weekly	1
arrive	1
in	1
this	1
town	1
scores	1
of	1
green	1
Vermonters	1
and	1
New	1
Hampshire	1
men,	1
all	1
athirst	1
for	1
gain	1
and	1
glory	1
in	1
the	1
fishery.	1
They	1
are	1
mostly	1
young,	1
of	1
stalwart	1
frames;	1
fellows	1
who	1
have	1
felled	1
forests,	1
and	1
now	1
seek	1
to	1
drop	1
the	1
axe	1
and	1
snatch	1
the	1
whale-lance.	1
Many	1
are	1
as	1
green	1
as	1
the	1
Green	1
Mountains	1
whence	1
they	1
came.	1
In	1
some	1
things	1
you	1
would	1
think	1
them	1
but	1
a	1
few	1
hours	1
old.	1
Look	1
there!	1
that	1
chap	1
strutting	1
round	1
the	1
corner.	1
He	1
wears	1
a	1
beaver	1
hat	1
and	1
swallow-tailed	1
coat,	1
girdled	1
with	1
a	1
sailor-belt	1
and	1
sheath-knife.	1
Here	1
comes	1
another	1
with	1
a	1
sou'-wester	1
and	1
a	1
bombazine	1
cloak.	1
No	1
town-bred	1
dandy	1
will	1
compare	1
with	1
a	1
country-bred	1
one--I	1
mean	1
a	1
downright	1
bumpkin	1
dandy--a	1
fellow	1
that,	1
in	1
the	1
dog-days,	1
will	1
mow	1
his	1
two	1
acres	1
in	1
buckskin	1
gloves	1
for	1
fear	1
of	1
tanning	1
his	1
hands.	1
Now	1
when	1
a	1
country	1
dandy	1
like	1
this	1
takes	1
it	1
into	1
his	1
head	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
distinguished	1
reputation,	1
and	1
joins	1
the	1
great	1
whale-fishery,	1
you	1
should	1
see	1
the	1
comical	1
things	1
he	1
does	1
upon	1
reaching	1
the	1
seaport.	1
In	1
bespeaking	1
his	1
sea-outfit,	1
he	1
orders	1
bell-buttons	1
to	1
his	1
waistcoats;	1
straps	1
to	1
his	1
canvas	1
trowsers.	1
Ah,	1
poor	1
Hay-Seed!	1
how	1
bitterly	1
will	1
burst	1
those	1
straps	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
howling	1
gale,	1
when	1
thou	1
art	1
driven,	1
straps,	1
buttons,	1
and	1
all,	1
down	1
the	1
throat	1
of	1
the	1
tempest.	1
But	1
think	1
not	1
that	1
this	1
famous	1
town	1
has	1
only	1
harpooneers,	1
cannibals,	1
and	1
bumpkins	1
to	1
show	1
her	1
visitors.	1
Not	1
at	1
all.	1
Still	1
New	1
Bedford	1
is	1
a	1
queer	1
place.	1
Had	1
it	1
not	1
been	1
for	1
us	1
whalemen,	1
that	1
tract	1
of	1
land	1
would	1
this	1
day	1
perhaps	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
as	1
howling	1
condition	1
as	1
the	1
coast	1
of	1
Labrador.	1
As	1
it	1
is,	1
parts	1
of	1
her	1
back	1
country	1
are	1
enough	1
to	1
frighten	1
one,	1
they	1
look	1
so	1
bony.	1
The	1
town	1
itself	1
is	1
perhaps	1
the	1
dearest	1
place	1
to	1
live	1
in,	1
in	1
all	1
New	1
England.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
land	1
of	1
oil,	1
true	1
enough:	1
but	1
not	1
like	1
Canaan;	1
a	1
land,	1
also,	1
of	1
corn	1
and	1
wine.	1
The	1
streets	1
do	1
not	1
run	1
with	1
milk;	1
nor	1
in	1
the	1
spring-time	1
do	1
they	1
pave	1
them	1
with	1
fresh	1
eggs.	1
Yet,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
this,	1
nowhere	1
in	1
all	1
America	1
will	1
you	1
find	1
more	1
patrician-like	1
houses;	1
parks	1
and	1
gardens	1
more	1
opulent,	1
than	1
in	1
New	1
Bedford.	1
Whence	1
came	1
they?	1
how	1
planted	1
upon	1
this	1
once	1
scraggy	1
scoria	1
of	1
a	1
country?	1
Go	1
and	1
gaze	1
upon	1
the	1
iron	1
emblematical	1
harpoons	1
round	1
yonder	1
lofty	1
mansion,	1
and	1
your	1
question	1
will	1
be	1
answered.	1
Yes;	1
all	1
these	1
brave	1
houses	1
and	1
flowery	1
gardens	1
came	1
from	1
the	1
Atlantic,	1
Pacific,	1
and	1
Indian	1
oceans.	1
One	1
and	1
all,	1
they	1
were	1
harpooned	1
and	1
dragged	1
up	1
hither	1
from	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
sea.	1
Can	1
Herr	1
Alexander	1
perform	1
a	1
feat	1
like	1
that?	1
In	1
New	1
Bedford,	1
fathers,	1
they	1
say,	1
give	1
whales	1
for	1
dowers	1
to	1
their	1
daughters,	1
and	1
portion	1
off	1
their	1
nieces	1
with	1
a	1
few	1
porpoises	1
a-piece.	1
You	1
must	1
go	1
to	1
New	1
Bedford	1
to	1
see	1
a	1
brilliant	1
wedding;	1
for,	1
they	1
say,	1
they	1
have	1
reservoirs	1
of	1
oil	1
in	1
every	1
house,	1
and	1
every	1
night	1
recklessly	1
burn	1
their	1
lengths	1
in	1
spermaceti	1
candles.	1
In	1
summer	1
time,	1
the	1
town	1
is	1
sweet	1
to	1
see;	1
full	1
of	1
fine	1
maples--long	1
avenues	1
of	1
green	1
and	1
gold.	1
And	1
in	1
August,	1
high	1
in	1
air,	1
the	1
beautiful	1
and	1
bountiful	1
horse-chestnuts,	1
candelabra-wise,	1
proffer	1
the	1
passer-by	1
their	1
tapering	1
upright	1
cones	1
of	1
congregated	1
blossoms.	1
So	1
omnipotent	1
is	1
art;	1
which	1
in	1
many	1
a	1
district	1
of	1
New	1
Bedford	1
has	1
superinduced	1
bright	1
terraces	1
of	1
flowers	1
upon	1
the	1
barren	1
refuse	1
rocks	1
thrown	1
aside	1
at	1
creation's	1
final	1
day.	1
And	1
the	1
women	1
of	1
New	1
Bedford,	1
they	1
bloom	1
like	1
their	1
own	1
red	1
roses.	1
But	1
roses	1
only	1
bloom	1
in	1
summer;	1
whereas	1
the	1
fine	1
carnation	1
of	1
their	1
cheeks	1
is	1
perennial	1
as	1
sunlight	1
in	1
the	1
seventh	1
heavens.	1
Elsewhere	1
match	1
that	1
bloom	1
of	1
theirs,	1
ye	1
cannot,	1
save	1
in	1
Salem,	1
where	1
they	1
tell	1
me	1
the	1
young	1
girls	1
breathe	1
such	1
musk,	1
their	1
sailor	1
sweethearts	1
smell	1
them	1
miles	1
off	1
shore,	1
as	1
though	1
they	1
were	1
drawing	1
nigh	1
the	1
odorous	1
Moluccas	1
instead	1
of	1
the	1
Puritanic	1
sands.	1
CHAPTER	1
7	1
The	1
Chapel.	1
In	1
this	1
same	1
New	1
Bedford	1
there	1
stands	1
a	1
Whaleman's	1
Chapel,	1
and	1
few	1
are	1
the	1
moody	1
fishermen,	1
shortly	1
bound	1
for	1
the	1
Indian	1
Ocean	1
or	1
Pacific,	1
who	1
fail	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
Sunday	1
visit	1
to	1
the	1
spot.	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
that	1
I	1
did	1
not.	1
Returning	1
from	1
my	1
first	1
morning	1
stroll,	1
I	1
again	1
sallied	1
out	1
upon	1
this	1
special	1
errand.	1
The	1
sky	1
had	1
changed	1
from	1
clear,	1
sunny	1
cold,	1
to	1
driving	1
sleet	1
and	1
mist.	1
Wrapping	1
myself	1
in	1
my	1
shaggy	1
jacket	1
of	1
the	1
cloth	1
called	1
bearskin,	1
I	1
fought	1
my	1
way	1
against	1
the	1
stubborn	1
storm.	1
Entering,	1
I	1
found	1
a	1
small	1
scattered	1
congregation	1
of	1
sailors,	1
and	1
sailors'	1
wives	1
and	1
widows.	1
A	1
muffled	1
silence	1
reigned,	1
only	1
broken	1
at	1
times	1
by	1
the	1
shrieks	1
of	1
the	1
storm.	1
Each	1
silent	1
worshipper	1
seemed	1
purposely	1
sitting	1
apart	1
from	1
the	1
other,	1
as	1
if	1
each	1
silent	1
grief	1
were	1
insular	1
and	1
incommunicable.	1
The	1
chaplain	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
arrived;	1
and	1
there	1
these	1
silent	1
islands	1
of	1
men	1
and	1
women	1
sat	1
steadfastly	1
eyeing	1
several	1
marble	1
tablets,	1
with	1
black	1
borders,	1
masoned	1
into	1
the	1
wall	1
on	1
either	1
side	1
the	1
pulpit.	1
Three	1
of	1
them	1
ran	1
something	1
like	1
the	1
following,	1
but	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
pretend	1
to	1
quote:--	1

THIS	1
TABLET	1
Is	1
erected	1
to	1
his	1
Memory	1
BY	1
HIS	1
WIDOW.	1
Shaking	1
off	1
the	1
sleet	1
from	1
my	1
ice-glazed	1
hat	1
and	1
jacket,	1
I	1
seated	1
myself	1
near	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
turning	1
sideways	1
was	1
surprised	1
to	1
see	1
Queequeg	1
near	1
me.	1
Affected	1
by	1
the	1
solemnity	1
of	1
the	1
scene,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
wondering	1
gaze	1
of	1
incredulous	1
curiosity	1
in	1
his	1
countenance.	1
This	1
savage	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
person	1
present	1
who	1
seemed	1
to	1
notice	1
my	1
entrance;	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
one	1
who	1
could	1
not	1
read,	1
and,	1
therefore,	1
was	1
not	1
reading	1
those	1
frigid	1
inscriptions	1
on	1
the	1
wall.	1
Whether	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
relatives	1
of	1
the	1
seamen	1
whose	1
names	1
appeared	1
there	1
were	1
now	1
among	1
the	1
congregation,	1
I	1
knew	1
not;	1
but	1
so	1
many	1
are	1
the	1
unrecorded	1
accidents	1
in	1
the	1
fishery,	1
and	1
so	1
plainly	1
did	1
several	1
women	1
present	1
wear	1
the	1
countenance	1
if	1
not	1
the	1
trappings	1
of	1
some	1
unceasing	1
grief,	1
that	1
I	1
feel	1
sure	1
that	1
here	1
before	1
me	1
were	1
assembled	1
those,	1
in	1
whose	1
unhealing	1
hearts	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
those	1
bleak	1
tablets	1
sympathetically	1
caused	1
the	1
old	1
wounds	1
to	1
bleed	1
afresh.	1
Oh!	1
ye	1
whose	1
dead	1
lie	1
buried	1
beneath	1
the	1
green	1
grass;	1
who	1
standing	1
among	1
flowers	1
can	1
say--here,	1
HERE	1
lies	1
my	1
beloved;	1
ye	1
know	1
not	1
the	1
desolation	1
that	1
broods	1
in	1
bosoms	1
like	1
these.	1
What	1
bitter	1
blanks	1
in	1
those	1
black-bordered	1
marbles	1
which	1
cover	1
no	1
ashes!	1
What	1
despair	1
in	1
those	1
immovable	1
inscriptions!	1
What	1
deadly	1
voids	1
and	1
unbidden	1
infidelities	1
in	1
the	1
lines	1
that	1
seem	1
to	1
gnaw	1
upon	1
all	1
Faith,	1
and	1
refuse	1
resurrections	1
to	1
the	1
beings	1
who	1
have	1
placelessly	1
perished	1
without	1
a	1
grave.	1
As	1
well	1
might	1
those	1
tablets	1
stand	1
in	1
the	1
cave	1
of	1
Elephanta	1
as	1
here.	1
In	1
what	1
census	1
of	1
living	1
creatures,	1
the	1
dead	1
of	1
mankind	1
are	1
included;	1
why	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
a	1
universal	1
proverb	1
says	1
of	1
them,	1
that	1
they	1
tell	1
no	1
tales,	1
though	1
containing	1
more	1
secrets	1
than	1
the	1
Goodwin	1
Sands;	1
how	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
to	1
his	1
name	1
who	1
yesterday	1
departed	1
for	1
the	1
other	1
world,	1
we	1
prefix	1
so	1
significant	1
and	1
infidel	1
a	1
word,	1
and	1
yet	1
do	1
not	1
thus	1
entitle	1
him,	1
if	1
he	1
but	1
embarks	1
for	1
the	1
remotest	1
Indies	1
of	1
this	1
living	1
earth;	1
why	1
the	1
Life	1
Insurance	1
Companies	1
pay	1
death-forfeitures	1
upon	1
immortals;	1
in	1
what	1
eternal,	1
unstirring	1
paralysis,	1
and	1
deadly,	1
hopeless	1
trance,	1
yet	1
lies	1
antique	1
Adam	1
who	1
died	1
sixty	1
round	1
centuries	1
ago;	1
how	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
we	1
still	1
refuse	1
to	1
be	1
comforted	1
for	1
those	1
who	1
we	1
nevertheless	1
maintain	1
are	1
dwelling	1
in	1
unspeakable	1
bliss;	1
why	1
all	1
the	1
living	1
so	1
strive	1
to	1
hush	1
all	1
the	1
dead;	1
wherefore	1
but	1
the	1
rumor	1
of	1
a	1
knocking	1
in	1
a	1
tomb	1
will	1
terrify	1
a	1
whole	1
city.	1
All	1
these	1
things	1
are	1
not	1
without	1
their	1
meanings.	1
But	1
Faith,	1
like	1
a	1
jackal,	1
feeds	1
among	1
the	1
tombs,	1
and	1
even	1
from	1
these	1
dead	1
doubts	1
she	1
gathers	1
her	1
most	1
vital	1
hope.	1
It	1
needs	1
scarcely	1
to	1
be	1
told,	1
with	1
what	1
feelings,	1
on	1
the	1
eve	1
of	1
a	1
Nantucket	1
voyage,	1
I	1
regarded	1
those	1
marble	1
tablets,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
murky	1
light	1
of	1
that	1
darkened,	1
doleful	1
day	1
read	1
the	1
fate	1
of	1
the	1
whalemen	1
who	1
had	1
gone	1
before	1
me.	1
Yes,	1
Ishmael,	1
the	1
same	1
fate	1
may	1
be	1
thine.	1
But	1
somehow	1
I	1
grew	1
merry	1
again.	1
Delightful	1
inducements	1
to	1
embark,	1
fine	1
chance	1
for	1
promotion,	1
it	1
seems--aye,	1
a	1
stove	1
boat	1
will	1
make	1
me	1
an	1
immortal	1
by	1
brevet.	1
Yes,	1
there	1
is	1
death	1
in	1
this	1
business	1
of	1
whaling--a	1
speechlessly	1
quick	1
chaotic	1
bundling	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
into	1
Eternity.	1
But	1
what	1
then?	1
Methinks	1
we	1
have	1
hugely	1
mistaken	1
this	1
matter	1
of	1
Life	1
and	1
Death.	1
Methinks	1
that	1
what	1
they	1
call	1
my	1
shadow	1
here	1
on	1
earth	1
is	1
my	1
true	1
substance.	1
Methinks	1
that	1
in	1
looking	1
at	1
things	1
spiritual,	1
we	1
are	1
too	1
much	1
like	1
oysters	1
observing	1
the	1
sun	1
through	1
the	1
water,	1
and	1
thinking	1
that	1
thick	1
water	1
the	1
thinnest	1
of	1
air.	1
Methinks	1
my	1
body	1
is	1
but	1
the	1
lees	1
of	1
my	1
better	1
being.	1
In	1
fact	1
take	1
my	1
body	1
who	1
will,	1
take	1
it	1
I	1
say,	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
me.	1
And	1
therefore	1
three	1
cheers	1
for	1
Nantucket;	1
and	1
come	1
a	1
stove	1
boat	1
and	1
stove	1
body	1
when	1
they	1
will,	1
for	1
stave	1
my	1
soul,	1
Jove	1
himself	1
cannot.	1
CHAPTER	1
8	1
The	1
Pulpit.	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
seated	1
very	1
long	1
ere	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
a	1
certain	1
venerable	1
robustness	1
entered;	1
immediately	1
as	1
the	1
storm-pelted	1
door	1
flew	1
back	1
upon	1
admitting	1
him,	1
a	1
quick	1
regardful	1
eyeing	1
of	1
him	1
by	1
all	1
the	1
congregation,	1
sufficiently	1
attested	1
that	1
this	1
fine	1
old	1
man	1
was	1
the	1
chaplain.	1
Yes,	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
famous	1
Father	1
Mapple,	1
so	1
called	1
by	1
the	1
whalemen,	1
among	1
whom	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
great	1
favourite.	1
He	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
sailor	1
and	1
a	1
harpooneer	1
in	1
his	1
youth,	1
but	1
for	1
many	1
years	1
past	1
had	1
dedicated	1
his	1
life	1
to	1
the	1
ministry.	1
At	1
the	1
time	1
I	1
now	1
write	1
of,	1
Father	1
Mapple	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
hardy	1
winter	1
of	1
a	1
healthy	1
old	1
age;	1
that	1
sort	1
of	1
old	1
age	1
which	1
seems	1
merging	1
into	1
a	1
second	1
flowering	1
youth,	1
for	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
fissures	1
of	1
his	1
wrinkles,	1
there	1
shone	1
certain	1
mild	1
gleams	1
of	1
a	1
newly	1
developing	1
bloom--the	1
spring	1
verdure	1
peeping	1
forth	1
even	1
beneath	1
February's	1
snow.	1
No	1
one	1
having	1
previously	1
heard	1
his	1
history,	1
could	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
behold	1
Father	1
Mapple	1
without	1
the	1
utmost	1
interest,	1
because	1
there	1
were	1
certain	1
engrafted	1
clerical	1
peculiarities	1
about	1
him,	1
imputable	1
to	1
that	1
adventurous	1
maritime	1
life	1
he	1
had	1
led.	1
When	1
he	1
entered	1
I	1
observed	1
that	1
he	1
carried	1
no	1
umbrella,	1
and	1
certainly	1
had	1
not	1
come	1
in	1
his	1
carriage,	1
for	1
his	1
tarpaulin	1
hat	1
ran	1
down	1
with	1
melting	1
sleet,	1
and	1
his	1
great	1
pilot	1
cloth	1
jacket	1
seemed	1
almost	1
to	1
drag	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
floor	1
with	1
the	1
weight	1
of	1
the	1
water	1
it	1
had	1
absorbed.	1
However,	1
hat	1
and	1
coat	1
and	1
overshoes	1
were	1
one	1
by	1
one	1
removed,	1
and	1
hung	1
up	1
in	1
a	1
little	1
space	1
in	1
an	1
adjacent	1
corner;	1
when,	1
arrayed	1
in	1
a	1
decent	1
suit,	1
he	1
quietly	1
approached	1
the	1
pulpit.	1
Like	1
most	1
old	1
fashioned	1
pulpits,	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
lofty	1
one,	1
and	1
since	1
a	1
regular	1
stairs	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
height	1
would,	1
by	1
its	1
long	1
angle	1
with	1
the	1
floor,	1
seriously	1
contract	1
the	1
already	1
small	1
area	1
of	1
the	1
chapel,	1
the	1
architect,	1
it	1
seemed,	1
had	1
acted	1
upon	1
the	1
hint	1
of	1
Father	1
Mapple,	1
and	1
finished	1
the	1
pulpit	1
without	1
a	1
stairs,	1
substituting	1
a	1
perpendicular	1
side	1
ladder,	1
like	1
those	1
used	1
in	1
mounting	1
a	1
ship	1
from	1
a	1
boat	1
at	1
sea.	1
The	1
wife	1
of	1
a	1
whaling	1
captain	1
had	1
provided	1
the	1
chapel	1
with	1
a	1
handsome	1
pair	1
of	1
red	1
worsted	1
man-ropes	1
for	1
this	1
ladder,	1
which,	1
being	1
itself	1
nicely	1
headed,	1
and	1
stained	1
with	1
a	1
mahogany	1
colour,	1
the	1
whole	1
contrivance,	1
considering	1
what	1
manner	1
of	1
chapel	1
it	1
was,	1
seemed	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
in	1
bad	1
taste.	1
Halting	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
at	1
the	1
foot	1
of	1
the	1
ladder,	1
and	1
with	1
both	1
hands	1
grasping	1
the	1
ornamental	1
knobs	1
of	1
the	1
man-ropes,	1
Father	1
Mapple	1
cast	1
a	1
look	1
upwards,	1
and	1
then	1
with	1
a	1
truly	1
sailor-like	1
but	1
still	1
reverential	1
dexterity,	1
hand	1
over	1
hand,	1
mounted	1
the	1
steps	1
as	1
if	1
ascending	1
the	1
main-top	1
of	1
his	1
vessel.	1
The	1
perpendicular	1
parts	1
of	1
this	1
side	1
ladder,	1
as	1
is	1
usually	1
the	1
case	1
with	1
swinging	1
ones,	1
were	1
of	1
cloth-covered	1
rope,	1
only	1
the	1
rounds	1
were	1
of	1
wood,	1
so	1
that	1
at	1
every	1
step	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
joint.	1
At	1
my	1
first	1
glimpse	1
of	1
the	1
pulpit,	1
it	1
had	1
not	1
escaped	1
me	1
that	1
however	1
convenient	1
for	1
a	1
ship,	1
these	1
joints	1
in	1
the	1
present	1
instance	1
seemed	1
unnecessary.	1
For	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
prepared	1
to	1
see	1
Father	1
Mapple	1
after	1
gaining	1
the	1
height,	1
slowly	1
turn	1
round,	1
and	1
stooping	1
over	1
the	1
pulpit,	1
deliberately	1
drag	1
up	1
the	1
ladder	1
step	1
by	1
step,	1
till	1
the	1
whole	1
was	1
deposited	1
within,	1
leaving	1
him	1
impregnable	1
in	1
his	1
little	1
Quebec.	1
I	1
pondered	1
some	1
time	1
without	1
fully	1
comprehending	1
the	1
reason	1
for	1
this.	1
Father	1
Mapple	1
enjoyed	1
such	1
a	1
wide	1
reputation	1
for	1
sincerity	1
and	1
sanctity,	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
suspect	1
him	1
of	1
courting	1
notoriety	1
by	1
any	1
mere	1
tricks	1
of	1
the	1
stage.	1
No,	1
thought	1
I,	1
there	1
must	1
be	1
some	1
sober	1
reason	1
for	1
this	1
thing;	1
furthermore,	1
it	1
must	1
symbolize	1
something	1
unseen.	1
Can	1
it	1
be,	1
then,	1
that	1
by	1
that	1
act	1
of	1
physical	1
isolation,	1
he	1
signifies	1
his	1
spiritual	1
withdrawal	1
for	1
the	1
time,	1
from	1
all	1
outward	1
worldly	1
ties	1
and	1
connexions?	1
Yes,	1
for	1
replenished	1
with	1
the	1
meat	1
and	1
wine	1
of	1
the	1
word,	1
to	1
the	1
faithful	1
man	1
of	1
God,	1
this	1
pulpit,	1
I	1
see,	1
is	1
a	1
self-containing	1
stronghold--a	1
lofty	1
Ehrenbreitstein,	1
with	1
a	1
perennial	1
well	1
of	1
water	1
within	1
the	1
walls.	1
But	1
the	1
side	1
ladder	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
only	1
strange	1
feature	1
of	1
the	1
place,	1
borrowed	1
from	1
the	1
chaplain's	1
former	1
sea-farings.	1
Between	1
the	1
marble	1
cenotaphs	1
on	1
either	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
pulpit,	1
the	1
wall	1
which	1
formed	1
its	1
back	1
was	1
adorned	1
with	1
a	1
large	1
painting	1
representing	1
a	1
gallant	1
ship	1
beating	1
against	1
a	1
terrible	1
storm	1
off	1
a	1
lee	1
coast	1
of	1
black	1
rocks	1
and	1
snowy	1
breakers.	1
But	1
high	1
above	1
the	1
flying	1
scud	1
and	1
dark-rolling	1
clouds,	1
there	1
floated	1
a	1
little	1
isle	1
of	1
sunlight,	1
from	1
which	1
beamed	1
forth	1
an	1
angel's	1
face;	1
and	1
this	1
bright	1
face	1
shed	1
a	1
distinct	1
spot	1
of	1
radiance	1
upon	1
the	1
ship's	1
tossed	1
deck,	1
something	1
like	1
that	1
silver	1
plate	1
now	1
inserted	1
into	1
the	1
Victory's	1
plank	1
where	1
Nelson	1
fell.	1
"Ah,	1
noble	1
ship,"	1
the	1
angel	1
seemed	1
to	1
say,	1
"beat	1
on,	1
beat	1
on,	1
thou	1
noble	1
ship,	1
and	1
bear	1
a	1
hardy	1
helm;	1
for	1
lo!	1
the	1
sun	1
is	1
breaking	1
through;	1
the	1
clouds	1
are	1
rolling	1
off--serenest	1
azure	1
is	1
at	1
hand."	1
Nor	1
was	1
the	1
pulpit	1
itself	1
without	1
a	1
trace	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
sea-taste	1
that	1
had	1
achieved	1
the	1
ladder	1
and	1
the	1
picture.	1
Its	1
panelled	1
front	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
likeness	1
of	1
a	1
ship's	1
bluff	1
bows,	1
and	1
the	1
Holy	1
Bible	1
rested	1
on	1
a	1
projecting	1
piece	1
of	1
scroll	1
work,	1
fashioned	1
after	1
a	1
ship's	1
fiddle-headed	1
beak.	1
What	1
could	1
be	1
more	1
full	1
of	1
meaning?--for	1
the	1
pulpit	1
is	1
ever	1
this	1
earth's	1
foremost	1
part;	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
comes	1
in	1
its	1
rear;	1
the	1
pulpit	1
leads	1
the	1
world.	1
From	1
thence	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
storm	1
of	1
God's	1
quick	1
wrath	1
is	1
first	1
descried,	1
and	1
the	1
bow	1
must	1
bear	1
the	1
earliest	1
brunt.	1
From	1
thence	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
breezes	1
fair	1
or	1
foul	1
is	1
first	1
invoked	1
for	1
favourable	1
winds.	1
Yes,	1
the	1
world's	1
a	1
ship	1
on	1
its	1
passage	1
out,	1
and	1
not	1
a	1
voyage	1
complete;	1
and	1
the	1
pulpit	1
is	1
its	1
prow.	1
CHAPTER	1
9	1
The	1
Sermon.	1
Father	1
Mapple	1
rose,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
mild	1
voice	1
of	1
unassuming	1
authority	1
ordered	1
the	1
scattered	1
people	1
to	1
condense.	1
"Starboard	1
gangway,	1
there!	1
side	1
away	1
to	1
larboard--larboard	1
gangway	1
to	1
starboard!	1
Midships!	1
midships!"	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
low	1
rumbling	1
of	1
heavy	1
sea-boots	1
among	1
the	1
benches,	1
and	1
a	1
still	1
slighter	1
shuffling	1
of	1
women's	1
shoes,	1
and	1
all	1
was	1
quiet	1
again,	1
and	1
every	1
eye	1
on	1
the	1
preacher.	1
He	1
paused	1
a	1
little;	1
then	1
kneeling	1
in	1
the	1
pulpit's	1
bows,	1
folded	1
his	1
large	1
brown	1
hands	1
across	1
his	1
chest,	1
uplifted	1
his	1
closed	1
eyes,	1
and	1
offered	1
a	1
prayer	1
so	1
deeply	1
devout	1
that	1
he	1
seemed	1
kneeling	1
and	1
praying	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
sea.	1
This	1
ended,	1
in	1
prolonged	1
solemn	1
tones,	1
like	1
the	1
continual	1
tolling	1
of	1
a	1
bell	1
in	1
a	1
ship	1
that	1
is	1
foundering	1
at	1
sea	1
in	1
a	1
fog--in	1
such	1
tones	1
he	1
commenced	1
reading	1
the	1
following	1
hymn;	1
but	1
changing	1
his	1
manner	1
towards	1
the	1
concluding	1
stanzas,	1
burst	1
forth	1
with	1
a	1
pealing	1
exultation	1
and	1
joy--	1
"The	1
ribs	1
and	1
terrors	1
in	1
the	1
whale,	1
Arched	1
over	1
me	1
a	1
dismal	1
gloom,	1
While	1
all	1
God's	1
sun-lit	1
waves	1
rolled	1
by,	1
And	1
lift	1
me	1
deepening	1
down	1
to	1
doom.	1
"I	1
saw	1
the	1
opening	1
maw	1
of	1
hell,	1
With	1
endless	1
pains	1
and	1
sorrows	1
there;	1
Which	1
none	1
but	1
they	1
that	1
feel	1
can	1
tell--	1
Oh,	1
I	1
was	1
plunging	1
to	1
despair.	1
"In	1
black	1
distress,	1
I	1
called	1
my	1
God,	1
When	1
I	1
could	1
scarce	1
believe	1
him	1
mine,	1
He	1
bowed	1
his	1
ear	1
to	1
my	1
complaints--	1
No	1
more	1
the	1
whale	1
did	1
me	1
confine.	1
"With	1
speed	1
he	1
flew	1
to	1
my	1
relief,	1
As	1
on	1
a	1
radiant	1
dolphin	1
borne;	1
Awful,	1
yet	1
bright,	1
as	1
lightning	1
shone	1
The	1
face	1
of	1
my	1
Deliverer	1
God.	1
"My	1
song	1
for	1
ever	1
shall	1
record	1
That	1
terrible,	1
that	1
joyful	1
hour;	1
I	1
give	1
the	1
glory	1
to	1
my	1
God,	1
His	1
all	1
the	1
mercy	1
and	1
the	1
power.	1
Nearly	1
all	1
joined	1
in	1
singing	1
this	1
hymn,	1
which	1
swelled	1
high	1
above	1
the	1
howling	1
of	1
the	1
storm.	1
A	1
brief	1
pause	1
ensued;	1
the	1
preacher	1
slowly	1
turned	1
over	1
the	1
leaves	1
of	1
the	1
Bible,	1
and	1
at	1
last,	1
folding	1
his	1
hand	1
down	1
upon	1
the	1
proper	1
page,	1
said:	1
"Beloved	1
shipmates,	1
clinch	1
the	1
last	1
verse	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
chapter	1
of	1
Jonah--'And	1
God	1
had	1
prepared	1
a	1
great	1
fish	1
to	1
swallow	1
up	1
Jonah.'"	1
"Shipmates,	1
this	1
book,	1
containing	1
only	1
four	1
chapters--four	1
yarns--is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
smallest	1
strands	1
in	1
the	1
mighty	1
cable	1
of	1
the	1
Scriptures.	1
Yet	1
what	1
depths	1
of	1
the	1
soul	1
does	1
Jonah's	1
deep	1
sealine	1
sound!	1
what	1
a	1
pregnant	1
lesson	1
to	1
us	1
is	1
this	1
prophet!	1
What	1
a	1
noble	1
thing	1
is	1
that	1
canticle	1
in	1
the	1
fish's	1
belly!	1
How	1
billow-like	1
and	1
boisterously	1
grand!	1
We	1
feel	1
the	1
floods	1
surging	1
over	1
us;	1
we	1
sound	1
with	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
kelpy	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
waters;	1
sea-weed	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
slime	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
is	1
about	1
us!	1
But	1
WHAT	1
is	1
this	1
lesson	1
that	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
Jonah	1
teaches?	1
Shipmates,	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
two-stranded	1
lesson;	1
a	1
lesson	1
to	1
us	1
all	1
as	1
sinful	1
men,	1
and	1
a	1
lesson	1
to	1
me	1
as	1
a	1
pilot	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
God.	1
As	1
sinful	1
men,	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
lesson	1
to	1
us	1
all,	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
story	1
of	1
the	1
sin,	1
hard-heartedness,	1
suddenly	1
awakened	1
fears,	1
the	1
swift	1
punishment,	1
repentance,	1
prayers,	1
and	1
finally	1
the	1
deliverance	1
and	1
joy	1
of	1
Jonah.	1
As	1
with	1
all	1
sinners	1
among	1
men,	1
the	1
sin	1
of	1
this	1
son	1
of	1
Amittai	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
wilful	1
disobedience	1
of	1
the	1
command	1
of	1
God--never	1
mind	1
now	1
what	1
that	1
command	1
was,	1
or	1
how	1
conveyed--which	1
he	1
found	1
a	1
hard	1
command.	1
But	1
all	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
God	1
would	1
have	1
us	1
do	1
are	1
hard	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
do--remember	1
that--and	1
hence,	1
he	1
oftener	1
commands	1
us	1
than	1
endeavors	1
to	1
persuade.	1
And	1
if	1
we	1
obey	1
God,	1
we	1
must	1
disobey	1
ourselves;	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
this	1
disobeying	1
ourselves,	1
wherein	1
the	1
hardness	1
of	1
obeying	1
God	1
consists.	1
"With	1
this	1
sin	1
of	1
disobedience	1
in	1
him,	1
Jonah	1
still	1
further	1
flouts	1
at	1
God,	1
by	1
seeking	1
to	1
flee	1
from	1
Him.	1
He	1
thinks	1
that	1
a	1
ship	1
made	1
by	1
men	1
will	1
carry	1
him	1
into	1
countries	1
where	1
God	1
does	1
not	1
reign,	1
but	1
only	1
the	1
Captains	1
of	1
this	1
earth.	1
He	1
skulks	1
about	1
the	1
wharves	1
of	1
Joppa,	1
and	1
seeks	1
a	1
ship	1
that's	1
bound	1
for	1
Tarshish.	1
There	1
lurks,	1
perhaps,	1
a	1
hitherto	1
unheeded	1
meaning	1
here.	1
By	1
all	1
accounts	1
Tarshish	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
no	1
other	1
city	1
than	1
the	1
modern	1
Cadiz.	1
That's	1
the	1
opinion	1
of	1
learned	1
men.	1
And	1
where	1
is	1
Cadiz,	1
shipmates?	1
Cadiz	1
is	1
in	1
Spain;	1
as	1
far	1
by	1
water,	1
from	1
Joppa,	1
as	1
Jonah	1
could	1
possibly	1
have	1
sailed	1
in	1
those	1
ancient	1
days,	1
when	1
the	1
Atlantic	1
was	1
an	1
almost	1
unknown	1
sea.	1
Because	1
Joppa,	1
the	1
modern	1
Jaffa,	1
shipmates,	1
is	1
on	1
the	1
most	1
easterly	1
coast	1
of	1
the	1
Mediterranean,	1
the	1
Syrian;	1
and	1
Tarshish	1
or	1
Cadiz	1
more	1
than	1
two	1
thousand	1
miles	1
to	1
the	1
westward	1
from	1
that,	1
just	1
outside	1
the	1
Straits	1
of	1
Gibraltar.	1
See	1
ye	1
not	1
then,	1
shipmates,	1
that	1
Jonah	1
sought	1
to	1
flee	1
world-wide	1
from	1
God?	1
Miserable	1
man!	1
Oh!	1
most	1
contemptible	1
and	1
worthy	1
of	1
all	1
scorn;	1
with	1
slouched	1
hat	1
and	1
guilty	1
eye,	1
skulking	1
from	1
his	1
God;	1
prowling	1
among	1
the	1
shipping	1
like	1
a	1
vile	1
burglar	1
hastening	1
to	1
cross	1
the	1
seas.	1
So	1
disordered,	1
self-condemning	1
is	1
his	1
look,	1
that	1
had	1
there	1
been	1
policemen	1
in	1
those	1
days,	1
Jonah,	1
on	1
the	1
mere	1
suspicion	1
of	1
something	1
wrong,	1
had	1
been	1
arrested	1
ere	1
he	1
touched	1
a	1
deck.	1
How	1
plainly	1
he's	1
a	1
fugitive!	1
no	1
baggage,	1
not	1
a	1
hat-box,	1
valise,	1
or	1
carpet-bag,--no	1
friends	1
accompany	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
wharf	1
with	1
their	1
adieux.	1
At	1
last,	1
after	1
much	1
dodging	1
search,	1
he	1
finds	1
the	1
Tarshish	1
ship	1
receiving	1
the	1
last	1
items	1
of	1
her	1
cargo;	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
steps	1
on	1
board	1
to	1
see	1
its	1
Captain	1
in	1
the	1
cabin,	1
all	1
the	1
sailors	1
for	1
the	1
moment	1
desist	1
from	1
hoisting	1
in	1
the	1
goods,	1
to	1
mark	1
the	1
stranger's	1
evil	1
eye.	1
Jonah	1
sees	1
this;	1
but	1
in	1
vain	1
he	1
tries	1
to	1
look	1
all	1
ease	1
and	1
confidence;	1
in	1
vain	1
essays	1
his	1
wretched	1
smile.	1
Strong	1
intuitions	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
assure	1
the	1
mariners	1
he	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
innocent.	1
In	1
their	1
gamesome	1
but	1
still	1
serious	1
way,	1
one	1
whispers	1
to	1
the	1
other--"Jack,	1
he's	1
robbed	1
a	1
widow;"	1
or,	1
"Joe,	1
do	1
you	1
mark	1
him;	1
he's	1
a	1
bigamist;"	1
or,	1
"Harry	1
lad,	1
I	1
guess	1
he's	1
the	1
adulterer	1
that	1
broke	1
jail	1
in	1
old	1
Gomorrah,	1
or	1
belike,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
missing	1
murderers	1
from	1
Sodom."	1
Another	1
runs	1
to	1
read	1
the	1
bill	1
that's	1
stuck	1
against	1
the	1
spile	1
upon	1
the	1
wharf	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
ship	1
is	1
moored,	1
offering	1
five	1
hundred	1
gold	1
coins	1
for	1
the	1
apprehension	1
of	1
a	1
parricide,	1
and	1
containing	1
a	1
description	1
of	1
his	1
person.	1
He	1
reads,	1
and	1
looks	1
from	1
Jonah	1
to	1
the	1
bill;	1
while	1
all	1
his	1
sympathetic	1
shipmates	1
now	1
crowd	1
round	1
Jonah,	1
prepared	1
to	1
lay	1
their	1
hands	1
upon	1
him.	1
Frighted	1
Jonah	1
trembles,	1
and	1
summoning	1
all	1
his	1
boldness	1
to	1
his	1
face,	1
only	1
looks	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
more	1
a	1
coward.	1
He	1
will	1
not	1
confess	1
himself	1
suspected;	1
but	1
that	1
itself	1
is	1
strong	1
suspicion.	1
So	1
he	1
makes	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
it;	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
sailors	1
find	1
him	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
is	1
advertised,	1
they	1
let	1
him	1
pass,	1
and	1
he	1
descends	1
into	1
the	1
cabin.	1
"'Who's	1
there?'	1
cries	1
the	1
Captain	1
at	1
his	1
busy	1
desk,	1
hurriedly	1
making	1
out	1
his	1
papers	1
for	1
the	1
Customs--'Who's	1
there?'	1
Oh!	1
how	1
that	1
harmless	1
question	1
mangles	1
Jonah!	1
For	1
the	1
instant	1
he	1
almost	1
turns	1
to	1
flee	1
again.	1
But	1
he	1
rallies.	1
'I	1
seek	1
a	1
passage	1
in	1
this	1
ship	1
to	1
Tarshish;	1
how	1
soon	1
sail	1
ye,	1
sir?'	1
Thus	1
far	1
the	1
busy	1
Captain	1
had	1
not	1
looked	1
up	1
to	1
Jonah,	1
though	1
the	1
man	1
now	1
stands	1
before	1
him;	1
but	1
no	1
sooner	1
does	1
he	1
hear	1
that	1
hollow	1
voice,	1
than	1
he	1
darts	1
a	1
scrutinizing	1
glance.	1
'We	1
sail	1
with	1
the	1
next	1
coming	1
tide,'	1
at	1
last	1
he	1
slowly	1
answered,	1
still	1
intently	1
eyeing	1
him.	1
'No	1
sooner,	1
sir?'--'Soon	1
enough	1
for	1
any	1
honest	1
man	1
that	1
goes	1
a	1
passenger.'	1
Ha!	1
Jonah,	1
that's	1
another	1
stab.	1
But	1
he	1
swiftly	1
calls	1
away	1
the	1
Captain	1
from	1
that	1
scent.	1
'I'll	1
sail	1
with	1
ye,'--he	1
says,--'the	1
passage	1
money	1
how	1
much	1
is	1
that?--I'll	1
pay	1
now.'	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
particularly	1
written,	1
shipmates,	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
thing	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
overlooked	1
in	1
this	1
history,	1
'that	1
he	1
paid	1
the	1
fare	1
thereof'	1
ere	1
the	1
craft	1
did	1
sail.	1
And	1
taken	1
with	1
the	1
context,	1
this	1
is	1
full	1
of	1
meaning.	1
"Now	1
Jonah's	1
Captain,	1
shipmates,	1
was	1
one	1
whose	1
discernment	1
detects	1
crime	1
in	1
any,	1
but	1
whose	1
cupidity	1
exposes	1
it	1
only	1
in	1
the	1
penniless.	1
In	1
this	1
world,	1
shipmates,	1
sin	1
that	1
pays	1
its	1
way	1
can	1
travel	1
freely,	1
and	1
without	1
a	1
passport;	1
whereas	1
Virtue,	1
if	1
a	1
pauper,	1
is	1
stopped	1
at	1
all	1
frontiers.	1
So	1
Jonah's	1
Captain	1
prepares	1
to	1
test	1
the	1
length	1
of	1
Jonah's	1
purse,	1
ere	1
he	1
judge	1
him	1
openly.	1
He	1
charges	1
him	1
thrice	1
the	1
usual	1
sum;	1
and	1
it's	1
assented	1
to.	1
Then	1
the	1
Captain	1
knows	1
that	1
Jonah	1
is	1
a	1
fugitive;	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
resolves	1
to	1
help	1
a	1
flight	1
that	1
paves	1
its	1
rear	1
with	1
gold.	1
Yet	1
when	1
Jonah	1
fairly	1
takes	1
out	1
his	1
purse,	1
prudent	1
suspicions	1
still	1
molest	1
the	1
Captain.	1
He	1
rings	1
every	1
coin	1
to	1
find	1
a	1
counterfeit.	1
Not	1
a	1
forger,	1
any	1
way,	1
he	1
mutters;	1
and	1
Jonah	1
is	1
put	1
down	1
for	1
his	1
passage.	1
'Point	1
out	1
my	1
state-room,	1
Sir,'	1
says	1
Jonah	1
now,	1
'I'm	1
travel-weary;	1
I	1
need	1
sleep.'	1
'Thou	1
lookest	1
like	1
it,'	1
says	1
the	1
Captain,	1
'there's	1
thy	1
room.'	1
Jonah	1
enters,	1
and	1
would	1
lock	1
the	1
door,	1
but	1
the	1
lock	1
contains	1
no	1
key.	1
Hearing	1
him	1
foolishly	1
fumbling	1
there,	1
the	1
Captain	1
laughs	1
lowly	1
to	1
himself,	1
and	1
mutters	1
something	1
about	1
the	1
doors	1
of	1
convicts'	1
cells	1
being	1
never	1
allowed	1
to	1
be	1
locked	1
within.	1
All	1
dressed	1
and	1
dusty	1
as	1
he	1
is,	1
Jonah	1
throws	1
himself	1
into	1
his	1
berth,	1
and	1
finds	1
the	1
little	1
state-room	1
ceiling	1
almost	1
resting	1
on	1
his	1
forehead.	1
The	1
air	1
is	1
close,	1
and	1
Jonah	1
gasps.	1
Then,	1
in	1
that	1
contracted	1
hole,	1
sunk,	1
too,	1
beneath	1
the	1
ship's	1
water-line,	1
Jonah	1
feels	1
the	1
heralding	1
presentiment	1
of	1
that	1
stifling	1
hour,	1
when	1
the	1
whale	1
shall	1
hold	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
smallest	1
of	1
his	1
bowels'	1
wards.	1
"Screwed	1
at	1
its	1
axis	1
against	1
the	1
side,	1
a	1
swinging	1
lamp	1
slightly	1
oscillates	1
in	1
Jonah's	1
room;	1
and	1
the	1
ship,	1
heeling	1
over	1
towards	1
the	1
wharf	1
with	1
the	1
weight	1
of	1
the	1
last	1
bales	1
received,	1
the	1
lamp,	1
flame	1
and	1
all,	1
though	1
in	1
slight	1
motion,	1
still	1
maintains	1
a	1
permanent	1
obliquity	1
with	1
reference	1
to	1
the	1
room;	1
though,	1
in	1
truth,	1
infallibly	1
straight	1
itself,	1
it	1
but	1
made	1
obvious	1
the	1
false,	1
lying	1
levels	1
among	1
which	1
it	1
hung.	1
The	1
lamp	1
alarms	1
and	1
frightens	1
Jonah;	1
as	1
lying	1
in	1
his	1
berth	1
his	1
tormented	1
eyes	1
roll	1
round	1
the	1
place,	1
and	1
this	1
thus	1
far	1
successful	1
fugitive	1
finds	1
no	1
refuge	1
for	1
his	1
restless	1
glance.	1
But	1
that	1
contradiction	1
in	1
the	1
lamp	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
appals	1
him.	1
The	1
floor,	1
the	1
ceiling,	1
and	1
the	1
side,	1
are	1
all	1
awry.	1
'Oh!	1
so	1
my	1
conscience	1
hangs	1
in	1
me!'	1
he	1
groans,	1
'straight	1
upwards,	1
so	1
it	1
burns;	1
but	1
the	1
chambers	1
of	1
my	1
soul	1
are	1
all	1
in	1
crookedness!'	1
"Like	1
one	1
who	1
after	1
a	1
night	1
of	1
drunken	1
revelry	1
hies	1
to	1
his	1
bed,	1
still	1
reeling,	1
but	1
with	1
conscience	1
yet	1
pricking	1
him,	1
as	1
the	1
plungings	1
of	1
the	1
Roman	1
race-horse	1
but	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
more	1
strike	1
his	1
steel	1
tags	1
into	1
him;	1
as	1
one	1
who	1
in	1
that	1
miserable	1
plight	1
still	1
turns	1
and	1
turns	1
in	1
giddy	1
anguish,	1
praying	1
God	1
for	1
annihilation	1
until	1
the	1
fit	1
be	1
passed;	1
and	1
at	1
last	1
amid	1
the	1
whirl	1
of	1
woe	1
he	1
feels,	1
a	1
deep	1
stupor	1
steals	1
over	1
him,	1
as	1
over	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
bleeds	1
to	1
death,	1
for	1
conscience	1
is	1
the	1
wound,	1
and	1
there's	1
naught	1
to	1
staunch	1
it;	1
so,	1
after	1
sore	1
wrestlings	1
in	1
his	1
berth,	1
Jonah's	1
prodigy	1
of	1
ponderous	1
misery	1
drags	1
him	1
drowning	1
down	1
to	1
sleep.	1
"And	1
now	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
tide	1
has	1
come;	1
the	1
ship	1
casts	1
off	1
her	1
cables;	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
deserted	1
wharf	1
the	1
uncheered	1
ship	1
for	1
Tarshish,	1
all	1
careening,	1
glides	1
to	1
sea.	1
That	1
ship,	1
my	1
friends,	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
of	1
recorded	1
smugglers!	1
the	1
contraband	1
was	1
Jonah.	1
But	1
the	1
sea	1
rebels;	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
bear	1
the	1
wicked	1
burden.	1
A	1
dreadful	1
storm	1
comes	1
on,	1
the	1
ship	1
is	1
like	1
to	1
break.	1
But	1
now	1
when	1
the	1
boatswain	1
calls	1
all	1
hands	1
to	1
lighten	1
her;	1
when	1
boxes,	1
bales,	1
and	1
jars	1
are	1
clattering	1
overboard;	1
when	1
the	1
wind	1
is	1
shrieking,	1
and	1
the	1
men	1
are	1
yelling,	1
and	1
every	1
plank	1
thunders	1
with	1
trampling	1
feet	1
right	1
over	1
Jonah's	1
head;	1
in	1
all	1
this	1
raging	1
tumult,	1
Jonah	1
sleeps	1
his	1
hideous	1
sleep.	1
He	1
sees	1
no	1
black	1
sky	1
and	1
raging	1
sea,	1
feels	1
not	1
the	1
reeling	1
timbers,	1
and	1
little	1
hears	1
he	1
or	1
heeds	1
he	1
the	1
far	1
rush	1
of	1
the	1
mighty	1
whale,	1
which	1
even	1
now	1
with	1
open	1
mouth	1
is	1
cleaving	1
the	1
seas	1
after	1
him.	1
Aye,	1
shipmates,	1
Jonah	1
was	1
gone	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
ship--a	1
berth	1
in	1
the	1
cabin	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
taken	1
it,	1
and	1
was	1
fast	1
asleep.	1
But	1
the	1
frightened	1
master	1
comes	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
shrieks	1
in	1
his	1
dead	1
ear,	1
'What	1
meanest	1
thou,	1
O,	1
sleeper!	1
arise!'	1
Startled	1
from	1
his	1
lethargy	1
by	1
that	1
direful	1
cry,	1
Jonah	1
staggers	1
to	1
his	1
feet,	1
and	1
stumbling	1
to	1
the	1
deck,	1
grasps	1
a	1
shroud,	1
to	1
look	1
out	1
upon	1
the	1
sea.	1
But	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
he	1
is	1
sprung	1
upon	1
by	1
a	1
panther	1
billow	1
leaping	1
over	1
the	1
bulwarks.	1
Wave	1
after	1
wave	1
thus	1
leaps	1
into	1
the	1
ship,	1
and	1
finding	1
no	1
speedy	1
vent	1
runs	1
roaring	1
fore	1
and	1
aft,	1
till	1
the	1
mariners	1
come	1
nigh	1
to	1
drowning	1
while	1
yet	1
afloat.	1
And	1
ever,	1
as	1
the	1
white	1
moon	1
shows	1
her	1
affrighted	1
face	1
from	1
the	1
steep	1
gullies	1
in	1
the	1
blackness	1
overhead,	1
aghast	1
Jonah	1
sees	1
the	1
rearing	1
bowsprit	1
pointing	1
high	1
upward,	1
but	1
soon	1
beat	1
downward	1
again	1
towards	1
the	1
tormented	1
deep.	1
"Terrors	1
upon	1
terrors	1
run	1
shouting	1
through	1
his	1
soul.	1
In	1
all	1
his	1
cringing	1
attitudes,	1
the	1
God-fugitive	1
is	1
now	1
too	1
plainly	1
known.	1
The	1
sailors	1
mark	1
him;	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
certain	1
grow	1
their	1
suspicions	1
of	1
him,	1
and	1
at	1
last,	1
fully	1
to	1
test	1
the	1
truth,	1
by	1
referring	1
the	1
whole	1
matter	1
to	1
high	1
Heaven,	1
they	1
fall	1
to	1
casting	1
lots,	1
to	1
see	1
for	1
whose	1
cause	1
this	1
great	1
tempest	1
was	1
upon	1
them.	1
The	1
lot	1
is	1
Jonah's;	1
that	1
discovered,	1
then	1
how	1
furiously	1
they	1
mob	1
him	1
with	1
their	1
questions.	1
'What	1
is	1
thine	1
occupation?	1
Whence	1
comest	1
thou?	1
Thy	1
country?	1
What	1
people?	1
But	1
mark	1
now,	1
my	1
shipmates,	1
the	1
behavior	1
of	1
poor	1
Jonah.	1
The	1
eager	1
mariners	1
but	1
ask	1
him	1
who	1
he	1
is,	1
and	1
where	1
from;	1
whereas,	1
they	1
not	1
only	1
receive	1
an	1
answer	1
to	1
those	1
questions,	1
but	1
likewise	1
another	1
answer	1
to	1
a	1
question	1
not	1
put	1
by	1
them,	1
but	1
the	1
unsolicited	1
answer	1
is	1
forced	1
from	1
Jonah	1
by	1
the	1
hard	1
hand	1
of	1
God	1
that	1
is	1
upon	1
him.	1
"'I	1
am	1
a	1
Hebrew,'	1
he	1
cries--and	1
then--'I	1
fear	1
the	1
Lord	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Heaven	1
who	1
hath	1
made	1
the	1
sea	1
and	1
the	1
dry	1
land!'	1
Fear	1
him,	1
O	1
Jonah?	1
Aye,	1
well	1
mightest	1
thou	1
fear	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
THEN!	1
Straightway,	1
he	1
now	1
goes	1
on	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
full	1
confession;	1
whereupon	1
the	1
mariners	1
became	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
appalled,	1
but	1
still	1
are	1
pitiful.	1
For	1
when	1
Jonah,	1
not	1
yet	1
supplicating	1
God	1
for	1
mercy,	1
since	1
he	1
but	1
too	1
well	1
knew	1
the	1
darkness	1
of	1
his	1
deserts,--when	1
wretched	1
Jonah	1
cries	1
out	1
to	1
them	1
to	1
take	1
him	1
and	1
cast	1
him	1
forth	1
into	1
the	1
sea,	1
for	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
for	1
HIS	1
sake	1
this	1
great	1
tempest	1
was	1
upon	1
them;	1
they	1
mercifully	1
turn	1
from	1
him,	1
and	1
seek	1
by	1
other	1
means	1
to	1
save	1
the	1
ship.	1
But	1
all	1
in	1
vain;	1
the	1
indignant	1
gale	1
howls	1
louder;	1
then,	1
with	1
one	1
hand	1
raised	1
invokingly	1
to	1
God,	1
with	1
the	1
other	1
they	1
not	1
unreluctantly	1
lay	1
hold	1
of	1
Jonah.	1
"And	1
now	1
behold	1
Jonah	1
taken	1
up	1
as	1
an	1
anchor	1
and	1
dropped	1
into	1
the	1
sea;	1
when	1
instantly	1
an	1
oily	1
calmness	1
floats	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
east,	1
and	1
the	1
sea	1
is	1
still,	1
as	1
Jonah	1
carries	1
down	1
the	1
gale	1
with	1
him,	1
leaving	1
smooth	1
water	1
behind.	1
He	1
goes	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
whirling	1
heart	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
masterless	1
commotion	1
that	1
he	1
scarce	1
heeds	1
the	1
moment	1
when	1
he	1
drops	1
seething	1
into	1
the	1
yawning	1
jaws	1
awaiting	1
him;	1
and	1
the	1
whale	1
shoots-to	1
all	1
his	1
ivory	1
teeth,	1
like	1
so	1
many	1
white	1
bolts,	1
upon	1
his	1
prison.	1
Then	1
Jonah	1
prayed	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
fish's	1
belly.	1
But	1
observe	1
his	1
prayer,	1
and	1
learn	1
a	1
weighty	1
lesson.	1
For	1
sinful	1
as	1
he	1
is,	1
Jonah	1
does	1
not	1
weep	1
and	1
wail	1
for	1
direct	1
deliverance.	1
He	1
feels	1
that	1
his	1
dreadful	1
punishment	1
is	1
just.	1
He	1
leaves	1
all	1
his	1
deliverance	1
to	1
God,	1
contenting	1
himself	1
with	1
this,	1
that	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
pains	1
and	1
pangs,	1
he	1
will	1
still	1
look	1
towards	1
His	1
holy	1
temple.	1
And	1
here,	1
shipmates,	1
is	1
true	1
and	1
faithful	1
repentance;	1
not	1
clamorous	1
for	1
pardon,	1
but	1
grateful	1
for	1
punishment.	1
And	1
how	1
pleasing	1
to	1
God	1
was	1
this	1
conduct	1
in	1
Jonah,	1
is	1
shown	1
in	1
the	1
eventual	1
deliverance	1
of	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
sea	1
and	1
the	1
whale.	1
Shipmates,	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
place	1
Jonah	1
before	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
copied	1
for	1
his	1
sin	1
but	1
I	1
do	1
place	1
him	1
before	1
you	1
as	1
a	1
model	1
for	1
repentance.	1
Sin	1
not;	1
but	1
if	1
you	1
do,	1
take	1
heed	1
to	1
repent	1
of	1
it	1
like	1
Jonah."	1
While	1
he	1
was	1
speaking	1
these	1
words,	1
the	1
howling	1
of	1
the	1
shrieking,	1
slanting	1
storm	1
without	1
seemed	1
to	1
add	1
new	1
power	1
to	1
the	1
preacher,	1
who,	1
when	1
describing	1
Jonah's	1
sea-storm,	1
seemed	1
tossed	1
by	1
a	1
storm	1
himself.	1
His	1
deep	1
chest	1
heaved	1
as	1
with	1
a	1
ground-swell;	1
his	1
tossed	1
arms	1
seemed	1
the	1
warring	1
elements	1
at	1
work;	1
and	1
the	1
thunders	1
that	1
rolled	1
away	1
from	1
off	1
his	1
swarthy	1
brow,	1
and	1
the	1
light	1
leaping	1
from	1
his	1
eye,	1
made	1
all	1
his	1
simple	1
hearers	1
look	1
on	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
quick	1
fear	1
that	1
was	1
strange	1
to	1
them.	1
There	1
now	1
came	1
a	1
lull	1
in	1
his	1
look,	1
as	1
he	1
silently	1
turned	1
over	1
the	1
leaves	1
of	1
the	1
Book	1
once	1
more;	1
and,	1
at	1
last,	1
standing	1
motionless,	1
with	1
closed	1
eyes,	1
for	1
the	1
moment,	1
seemed	1
communing	1
with	1
God	1
and	1
himself.	1
But	1
again	1
he	1
leaned	1
over	1
towards	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
bowing	1
his	1
head	1
lowly,	1
with	1
an	1
aspect	1
of	1
the	1
deepest	1
yet	1
manliest	1
humility,	1
he	1
spake	1
these	1
words:	1
"Shipmates,	1
God	1
has	1
laid	1
but	1
one	1
hand	1
upon	1
you;	1
both	1
his	1
hands	1
press	1
upon	1
me.	1
I	1
have	1
read	1
ye	1
by	1
what	1
murky	1
light	1
may	1
be	1
mine	1
the	1
lesson	1
that	1
Jonah	1
teaches	1
to	1
all	1
sinners;	1
and	1
therefore	1
to	1
ye,	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
to	1
me,	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
greater	1
sinner	1
than	1
ye.	1
And	1
now	1
how	1
gladly	1
would	1
I	1
come	1
down	1
from	1
this	1
mast-head	1
and	1
sit	1
on	1
the	1
hatches	1
there	1
where	1
you	1
sit,	1
and	1
listen	1
as	1
you	1
listen,	1
while	1
some	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
reads	1
ME	1
that	1
other	1
and	1
more	1
awful	1
lesson	1
which	1
Jonah	1
teaches	1
to	1
ME,	1
as	1
a	1
pilot	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
God.	1
How	1
being	1
an	1
anointed	1
pilot-prophet,	1
or	1
speaker	1
of	1
true	1
things,	1
and	1
bidden	1
by	1
the	1
Lord	1
to	1
sound	1
those	1
unwelcome	1
truths	1
in	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
a	1
wicked	1
Nineveh,	1
Jonah,	1
appalled	1
at	1
the	1
hostility	1
he	1
should	1
raise,	1
fled	1
from	1
his	1
mission,	1
and	1
sought	1
to	1
escape	1
his	1
duty	1
and	1
his	1
God	1
by	1
taking	1
ship	1
at	1
Joppa.	1
But	1
God	1
is	1
everywhere;	1
Tarshish	1
he	1
never	1
reached.	1
As	1
we	1
have	1
seen,	1
God	1
came	1
upon	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
whale,	1
and	1
swallowed	1
him	1
down	1
to	1
living	1
gulfs	1
of	1
doom,	1
and	1
with	1
swift	1
slantings	1
tore	1
him	1
along	1
'into	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
seas,'	1
where	1
the	1
eddying	1
depths	1
sucked	1
him	1
ten	1
thousand	1
fathoms	1
down,	1
and	1
'the	1
weeds	1
were	1
wrapped	1
about	1
his	1
head,'	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
watery	1
world	1
of	1
woe	1
bowled	1
over	1
him.	1
Yet	1
even	1
then	1
beyond	1
the	1
reach	1
of	1
any	1
plummet--'out	1
of	1
the	1
belly	1
of	1
hell'--when	1
the	1
whale	1
grounded	1
upon	1
the	1
ocean's	1
utmost	1
bones,	1
even	1
then,	1
God	1
heard	1
the	1
engulphed,	1
repenting	1
prophet	1
when	1
he	1
cried.	1
Then	1
God	1
spake	1
unto	1
the	1
fish;	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
shuddering	1
cold	1
and	1
blackness	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
the	1
whale	1
came	1
breeching	1
up	1
towards	1
the	1
warm	1
and	1
pleasant	1
sun,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
delights	1
of	1
air	1
and	1
earth;	1
and	1
'vomited	1
out	1
Jonah	1
upon	1
the	1
dry	1
land;'	1
when	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
came	1
a	1
second	1
time;	1
and	1
Jonah,	1
bruised	1
and	1
beaten--his	1
ears,	1
like	1
two	1
sea-shells,	1
still	1
multitudinously	1
murmuring	1
of	1
the	1
ocean--Jonah	1
did	1
the	1
Almighty's	1
bidding.	1
And	1
what	1
was	1
that,	1
shipmates?	1
To	1
preach	1
the	1
Truth	1
to	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
Falsehood!	1
That	1
was	1
it!	1
"This,	1
shipmates,	1
this	1
is	1
that	1
other	1
lesson;	1
and	1
woe	1
to	1
that	1
pilot	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
God	1
who	1
slights	1
it.	1
Woe	1
to	1
him	1
whom	1
this	1
world	1
charms	1
from	1
Gospel	1
duty!	1
Woe	1
to	1
him	1
who	1
seeks	1
to	1
pour	1
oil	1
upon	1
the	1
waters	1
when	1
God	1
has	1
brewed	1
them	1
into	1
a	1
gale!	1
Woe	1
to	1
him	1
who	1
seeks	1
to	1
please	1
rather	1
than	1
to	1
appal!	1
Woe	1
to	1
him	1
whose	1
good	1
name	1
is	1
more	1
to	1
him	1
than	1
goodness!	1
Woe	1
to	1
him	1
who,	1
in	1
this	1
world,	1
courts	1
not	1
dishonour!	1
Woe	1
to	1
him	1
who	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
true,	1
even	1
though	1
to	1
be	1
false	1
were	1
salvation!	1
Yea,	1
woe	1
to	1
him	1
who,	1
as	1
the	1
great	1
Pilot	1
Paul	1
has	1
it,	1
while	1
preaching	1
to	1
others	1
is	1
himself	1
a	1
castaway!"	1
He	1
dropped	1
and	1
fell	1
away	1
from	1
himself	1
for	1
a	1
moment;	1
then	1
lifting	1
his	1
face	1
to	1
them	1
again,	1
showed	1
a	1
deep	1
joy	1
in	1
his	1
eyes,	1
as	1
he	1
cried	1
out	1
with	1
a	1
heavenly	1
enthusiasm,--"But	1
oh!	1
shipmates!	1
on	1
the	1
starboard	1
hand	1
of	1
every	1
woe,	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
sure	1
delight;	1
and	1
higher	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
that	1
delight,	1
than	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
woe	1
is	1
deep.	1
Is	1
not	1
the	1
main-truck	1
higher	1
than	1
the	1
kelson	1
is	1
low?	1
Delight	1
is	1
to	1
him--a	1
far,	1
far	1
upward,	1
and	1
inward	1
delight--who	1
against	1
the	1
proud	1
gods	1
and	1
commodores	1
of	1
this	1
earth,	1
ever	1
stands	1
forth	1
his	1
own	1
inexorable	1
self.	1
Delight	1
is	1
to	1
him	1
whose	1
strong	1
arms	1
yet	1
support	1
him,	1
when	1
the	1
ship	1
of	1
this	1
base	1
treacherous	1
world	1
has	1
gone	1
down	1
beneath	1
him.	1
Delight	1
is	1
to	1
him,	1
who	1
gives	1
no	1
quarter	1
in	1
the	1
truth,	1
and	1
kills,	1
burns,	1
and	1
destroys	1
all	1
sin	1
though	1
he	1
pluck	1
it	1
out	1
from	1
under	1
the	1
robes	1
of	1
Senators	1
and	1
Judges.	1
Delight,--top-gallant	1
delight	1
is	1
to	1
him,	1
who	1
acknowledges	1
no	1
law	1
or	1
lord,	1
but	1
the	1
Lord	1
his	1
God,	1
and	1
is	1
only	1
a	1
patriot	1
to	1
heaven.	1
Delight	1
is	1
to	1
him,	1
whom	1
all	1
the	1
waves	1
of	1
the	1
billows	1
of	1
the	1
seas	1
of	1
the	1
boisterous	1
mob	1
can	1
never	1
shake	1
from	1
this	1
sure	1
Keel	1
of	1
the	1
Ages.	1
And	1
eternal	1
delight	1
and	1
deliciousness	1
will	1
be	1
his,	1
who	1
coming	1
to	1
lay	1
him	1
down,	1
can	1
say	1
with	1
his	1
final	1
breath--O	1
Father!--chiefly	1
known	1
to	1
me	1
by	1
Thy	1
rod--mortal	1
or	1
immortal,	1
here	1
I	1
die.	1
I	1
have	1
striven	1
to	1
be	1
Thine,	1
more	1
than	1
to	1
be	1
this	1
world's,	1
or	1
mine	1
own.	1
Yet	1
this	1
is	1
nothing:	1
I	1
leave	1
eternity	1
to	1
Thee;	1
for	1
what	1
is	1
man	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
live	1
out	1
the	1
lifetime	1
of	1
his	1
God?"	1
He	1
said	1
no	1
more,	1
but	1
slowly	1
waving	1
a	1
benediction,	1
covered	1
his	1
face	1
with	1
his	1
hands,	1
and	1
so	1
remained	1
kneeling,	1
till	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
had	1
departed,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
left	1
alone	1
in	1
the	1
place.	1
CHAPTER	1
10	1
A	1
Bosom	1
Friend.	1
Returning	1
to	1
the	1
Spouter-Inn	1
from	1
the	1
Chapel,	1
I	1
found	1
Queequeg	1
there	1
quite	1
alone;	1
he	1
having	1
left	1
the	1
Chapel	1
before	1
the	1
benediction	1
some	1
time.	1
He	1
was	1
sitting	1
on	1
a	1
bench	1
before	1
the	1
fire,	1
with	1
his	1
feet	1
on	1
the	1
stove	1
hearth,	1
and	1
in	1
one	1
hand	1
was	1
holding	1
close	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
face	1
that	1
little	1
negro	1
idol	1
of	1
his;	1
peering	1
hard	1
into	1
its	1
face,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
jack-knife	1
gently	1
whittling	1
away	1
at	1
its	1
nose,	1
meanwhile	1
humming	1
to	1
himself	1
in	1
his	1
heathenish	1
way.	1
But	1
being	1
now	1
interrupted,	1
he	1
put	1
up	1
the	1
image;	1
and	1
pretty	1
soon,	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
table,	1
took	1
up	1
a	1
large	1
book	1
there,	1
and	1
placing	1
it	1
on	1
his	1
lap	1
began	1
counting	1
the	1
pages	1
with	1
deliberate	1
regularity;	1
at	1
every	1
fiftieth	1
page--as	1
I	1
fancied--stopping	1
a	1
moment,	1
looking	1
vacantly	1
around	1
him,	1
and	1
giving	1
utterance	1
to	1
a	1
long-drawn	1
gurgling	1
whistle	1
of	1
astonishment.	1
He	1
would	1
then	1
begin	1
again	1
at	1
the	1
next	1
fifty;	1
seeming	1
to	1
commence	1
at	1
number	1
one	1
each	1
time,	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
count	1
more	1
than	1
fifty,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
by	1
such	1
a	1
large	1
number	1
of	1
fifties	1
being	1
found	1
together,	1
that	1
his	1
astonishment	1
at	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
pages	1
was	1
excited.	1
With	1
much	1
interest	1
I	1
sat	1
watching	1
him.	1
Savage	1
though	1
he	1
was,	1
and	1
hideously	1
marred	1
about	1
the	1
face--at	1
least	1
to	1
my	1
taste--his	1
countenance	1
yet	1
had	1
a	1
something	1
in	1
it	1
which	1
was	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
disagreeable.	1
You	1
cannot	1
hide	1
the	1
soul.	1
Through	1
all	1
his	1
unearthly	1
tattooings,	1
I	1
thought	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
traces	1
of	1
a	1
simple	1
honest	1
heart;	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
large,	1
deep	1
eyes,	1
fiery	1
black	1
and	1
bold,	1
there	1
seemed	1
tokens	1
of	1
a	1
spirit	1
that	1
would	1
dare	1
a	1
thousand	1
devils.	1
And	1
besides	1
all	1
this,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
certain	1
lofty	1
bearing	1
about	1
the	1
Pagan,	1
which	1
even	1
his	1
uncouthness	1
could	1
not	1
altogether	1
maim.	1
He	1
looked	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
never	1
cringed	1
and	1
never	1
had	1
had	1
a	1
creditor.	1
Whether	1
it	1
was,	1
too,	1
that	1
his	1
head	1
being	1
shaved,	1
his	1
forehead	1
was	1
drawn	1
out	1
in	1
freer	1
and	1
brighter	1
relief,	1
and	1
looked	1
more	1
expansive	1
than	1
it	1
otherwise	1
would,	1
this	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
venture	1
to	1
decide;	1
but	1
certain	1
it	1
was	1
his	1
head	1
was	1
phrenologically	1
an	1
excellent	1
one.	1
It	1
may	1
seem	1
ridiculous,	1
but	1
it	1
reminded	1
me	1
of	1
General	1
Washington's	1
head,	1
as	1
seen	1
in	1
the	1
popular	1
busts	1
of	1
him.	1
It	1
had	1
the	1
same	1
long	1
regularly	1
graded	1
retreating	1
slope	1
from	1
above	1
the	1
brows,	1
which	1
were	1
likewise	1
very	1
projecting,	1
like	1
two	1
long	1
promontories	1
thickly	1
wooded	1
on	1
top.	1
Queequeg	1
was	1
George	1
Washington	1
cannibalistically	1
developed.	1
Whilst	1
I	1
was	1
thus	1
closely	1
scanning	1
him,	1
half-pretending	1
meanwhile	1
to	1
be	1
looking	1
out	1
at	1
the	1
storm	1
from	1
the	1
casement,	1
he	1
never	1
heeded	1
my	1
presence,	1
never	1
troubled	1
himself	1
with	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
a	1
single	1
glance;	1
but	1
appeared	1
wholly	1
occupied	1
with	1
counting	1
the	1
pages	1
of	1
the	1
marvellous	1
book.	1
Considering	1
how	1
sociably	1
we	1
had	1
been	1
sleeping	1
together	1
the	1
night	1
previous,	1
and	1
especially	1
considering	1
the	1
affectionate	1
arm	1
I	1
had	1
found	1
thrown	1
over	1
me	1
upon	1
waking	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
I	1
thought	1
this	1
indifference	1
of	1
his	1
very	1
strange.	1
But	1
savages	1
are	1
strange	1
beings;	1
at	1
times	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
exactly	1
how	1
to	1
take	1
them.	1
At	1
first	1
they	1
are	1
overawing;	1
their	1
calm	1
self-collectedness	1
of	1
simplicity	1
seems	1
a	1
Socratic	1
wisdom.	1
I	1
had	1
noticed	1
also	1
that	1
Queequeg	1
never	1
consorted	1
at	1
all,	1
or	1
but	1
very	1
little,	1
with	1
the	1
other	1
seamen	1
in	1
the	1
inn.	1
He	1
made	1
no	1
advances	1
whatever;	1
appeared	1
to	1
have	1
no	1
desire	1
to	1
enlarge	1
the	1
circle	1
of	1
his	1
acquaintances.	1
All	1
this	1
struck	1
me	1
as	1
mighty	1
singular;	1
yet,	1
upon	1
second	1
thoughts,	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
almost	1
sublime	1
in	1
it.	1
Here	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
some	1
twenty	1
thousand	1
miles	1
from	1
home,	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
Cape	1
Horn,	1
that	1
is--which	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
way	1
he	1
could	1
get	1
there--thrown	1
among	1
people	1
as	1
strange	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
planet	1
Jupiter;	1
and	1
yet	1
he	1
seemed	1
entirely	1
at	1
his	1
ease;	1
preserving	1
the	1
utmost	1
serenity;	1
content	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
companionship;	1
always	1
equal	1
to	1
himself.	1
Surely	1
this	1
was	1
a	1
touch	1
of	1
fine	1
philosophy;	1
though	1
no	1
doubt	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
heard	1
there	1
was	1
such	1
a	1
thing	1
as	1
that.	1
But,	1
perhaps,	1
to	1
be	1
true	1
philosophers,	1
we	1
mortals	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
conscious	1
of	1
so	1
living	1
or	1
so	1
striving.	1
So	1
soon	1
as	1
I	1
hear	1
that	1
such	1
or	1
such	1
a	1
man	1
gives	1
himself	1
out	1
for	1
a	1
philosopher,	1
I	1
conclude	1
that,	1
like	1
the	1
dyspeptic	1
old	1
woman,	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
"broken	1
his	1
digester."	1
As	1
I	1
sat	1
there	1
in	1
that	1
now	1
lonely	1
room;	1
the	1
fire	1
burning	1
low,	1
in	1
that	1
mild	1
stage	1
when,	1
after	1
its	1
first	1
intensity	1
has	1
warmed	1
the	1
air,	1
it	1
then	1
only	1
glows	1
to	1
be	1
looked	1
at;	1
the	1
evening	1
shades	1
and	1
phantoms	1
gathering	1
round	1
the	1
casements,	1
and	1
peering	1
in	1
upon	1
us	1
silent,	1
solitary	1
twain;	1
the	1
storm	1
booming	1
without	1
in	1
solemn	1
swells;	1
I	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
sensible	1
of	1
strange	1
feelings.	1
I	1
felt	1
a	1
melting	1
in	1
me.	1
No	1
more	1
my	1
splintered	1
heart	1
and	1
maddened	1
hand	1
were	1
turned	1
against	1
the	1
wolfish	1
world.	1
This	1
soothing	1
savage	1
had	1
redeemed	1
it.	1
There	1
he	1
sat,	1
his	1
very	1
indifference	1
speaking	1
a	1
nature	1
in	1
which	1
there	1
lurked	1
no	1
civilized	1
hypocrisies	1
and	1
bland	1
deceits.	1
Wild	1
he	1
was;	1
a	1
very	1
sight	1
of	1
sights	1
to	1
see;	1
yet	1
I	1
began	1
to	1
feel	1
myself	1
mysteriously	1
drawn	1
towards	1
him.	1
And	1
those	1
same	1
things	1
that	1
would	1
have	1
repelled	1
most	1
others,	1
they	1
were	1
the	1
very	1
magnets	1
that	1
thus	1
drew	1
me.	1
I'll	1
try	1
a	1
pagan	1
friend,	1
thought	1
I,	1
since	1
Christian	1
kindness	1
has	1
proved	1
but	1
hollow	1
courtesy.	1
I	1
drew	1
my	1
bench	1
near	1
him,	1
and	1
made	1
some	1
friendly	1
signs	1
and	1
hints,	1
doing	1
my	1
best	1
to	1
talk	1
with	1
him	1
meanwhile.	1
At	1
first	1
he	1
little	1
noticed	1
these	1
advances;	1
but	1
presently,	1
upon	1
my	1
referring	1
to	1
his	1
last	1
night's	1
hospitalities,	1
he	1
made	1
out	1
to	1
ask	1
me	1
whether	1
we	1
were	1
again	1
to	1
be	1
bedfellows.	1
I	1
told	1
him	1
yes;	1
whereat	1
I	1
thought	1
he	1
looked	1
pleased,	1
perhaps	1
a	1
little	1
complimented.	1
We	1
then	1
turned	1
over	1
the	1
book	1
together,	1
and	1
I	1
endeavored	1
to	1
explain	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
the	1
printing,	1
and	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
the	1
few	1
pictures	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
it.	1
Thus	1
I	1
soon	1
engaged	1
his	1
interest;	1
and	1
from	1
that	1
we	1
went	1
to	1
jabbering	1
the	1
best	1
we	1
could	1
about	1
the	1
various	1
outer	1
sights	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
in	1
this	1
famous	1
town.	1
Soon	1
I	1
proposed	1
a	1
social	1
smoke;	1
and,	1
producing	1
his	1
pouch	1
and	1
tomahawk,	1
he	1
quietly	1
offered	1
me	1
a	1
puff.	1
And	1
then	1
we	1
sat	1
exchanging	1
puffs	1
from	1
that	1
wild	1
pipe	1
of	1
his,	1
and	1
keeping	1
it	1
regularly	1
passing	1
between	1
us.	1
If	1
there	1
yet	1
lurked	1
any	1
ice	1
of	1
indifference	1
towards	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
Pagan's	1
breast,	1
this	1
pleasant,	1
genial	1
smoke	1
we	1
had,	1
soon	1
thawed	1
it	1
out,	1
and	1
left	1
us	1
cronies.	1
He	1
seemed	1
to	1
take	1
to	1
me	1
quite	1
as	1
naturally	1
and	1
unbiddenly	1
as	1
I	1
to	1
him;	1
and	1
when	1
our	1
smoke	1
was	1
over,	1
he	1
pressed	1
his	1
forehead	1
against	1
mine,	1
clasped	1
me	1
round	1
the	1
waist,	1
and	1
said	1
that	1
henceforth	1
we	1
were	1
married;	1
meaning,	1
in	1
his	1
country's	1
phrase,	1
that	1
we	1
were	1
bosom	1
friends;	1
he	1
would	1
gladly	1
die	1
for	1
me,	1
if	1
need	1
should	1
be.	1
In	1
a	1
countryman,	1
this	1
sudden	1
flame	1
of	1
friendship	1
would	1
have	1
seemed	1
far	1
too	1
premature,	1
a	1
thing	1
to	1
be	1
much	1
distrusted;	1
but	1
in	1
this	1
simple	1
savage	1
those	1
old	1
rules	1
would	1
not	1
apply.	1
After	1
supper,	1
and	1
another	1
social	1
chat	1
and	1
smoke,	1
we	1
went	1
to	1
our	1
room	1
together.	1
He	1
made	1
me	1
a	1
present	1
of	1
his	1
embalmed	1
head;	1
took	1
out	1
his	1
enormous	1
tobacco	1
wallet,	1
and	1
groping	1
under	1
the	1
tobacco,	1
drew	1
out	1
some	1
thirty	1
dollars	1
in	1
silver;	1
then	1
spreading	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
table,	1
and	1
mechanically	1
dividing	1
them	1
into	1
two	1
equal	1
portions,	1
pushed	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
towards	1
me,	1
and	1
said	1
it	1
was	1
mine.	1
I	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
remonstrate;	1
but	1
he	1
silenced	1
me	1
by	1
pouring	1
them	1
into	1
my	1
trowsers'	1
pockets.	1
I	1
let	1
them	1
stay.	1
He	1
then	1
went	1
about	1
his	1
evening	1
prayers,	1
took	1
out	1
his	1
idol,	1
and	1
removed	1
the	1
paper	1
fireboard.	1
By	1
certain	1
signs	1
and	1
symptoms,	1
I	1
thought	1
he	1
seemed	1
anxious	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
join	1
him;	1
but	1
well	1
knowing	1
what	1
was	1
to	1
follow,	1
I	1
deliberated	1
a	1
moment	1
whether,	1
in	1
case	1
he	1
invited	1
me,	1
I	1
would	1
comply	1
or	1
otherwise.	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
good	1
Christian;	1
born	1
and	1
bred	1
in	1
the	1
bosom	1
of	1
the	1
infallible	1
Presbyterian	1
Church.	1
How	1
then	1
could	1
I	1
unite	1
with	1
this	1
wild	1
idolator	1
in	1
worshipping	1
his	1
piece	1
of	1
wood?	1
But	1
what	1
is	1
worship?	1
thought	1
I.	1
Do	1
you	1
suppose	1
now,	1
Ishmael,	1
that	1
the	1
magnanimous	1
God	1
of	1
heaven	1
and	1
earth--pagans	1
and	1
all	1
included--can	1
possibly	1
be	1
jealous	1
of	1
an	1
insignificant	1
bit	1
of	1
black	1
wood?	1
Impossible!	1
But	1
what	1
is	1
worship?--to	1
do	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God--THAT	1
is	1
worship.	1
And	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God?--to	1
do	1
to	1
my	1
fellow	1
man	1
what	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
my	1
fellow	1
man	1
to	1
do	1
to	1
me--THAT	1
is	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God.	1
Now,	1
Queequeg	1
is	1
my	1
fellow	1
man.	1
And	1
what	1
do	1
I	1
wish	1
that	1
this	1
Queequeg	1
would	1
do	1
to	1
me?	1
Why,	1
unite	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
my	1
particular	1
Presbyterian	1
form	1
of	1
worship.	1
Consequently,	1
I	1
must	1
then	1
unite	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
his;	1
ergo,	1
I	1
must	1
turn	1
idolator.	1
So	1
I	1
kindled	1
the	1
shavings;	1
helped	1
prop	1
up	1
the	1
innocent	1
little	1
idol;	1
offered	1
him	1
burnt	1
biscuit	1
with	1
Queequeg;	1
salamed	1
before	1
him	1
twice	1
or	1
thrice;	1
kissed	1
his	1
nose;	1
and	1
that	1
done,	1
we	1
undressed	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
bed,	1
at	1
peace	1
with	1
our	1
own	1
consciences	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
world.	1
But	1
we	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
to	1
sleep	1
without	1
some	1
little	1
chat.	1
How	1
it	1
is	1
I	1
know	1
not;	1
but	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
place	1
like	1
a	1
bed	1
for	1
confidential	1
disclosures	1
between	1
friends.	1
Man	1
and	1
wife,	1
they	1
say,	1
there	1
open	1
the	1
very	1
bottom	1
of	1
their	1
souls	1
to	1
each	1
other;	1
and	1
some	1
old	1
couples	1
often	1
lie	1
and	1
chat	1
over	1
old	1
times	1
till	1
nearly	1
morning.	1
Thus,	1
then,	1
in	1
our	1
hearts'	1
honeymoon,	1
lay	1
I	1
and	1
Queequeg--a	1
cosy,	1
loving	1
pair.	1
CHAPTER	1
11	1
Nightgown.	1
We	1
had	1
lain	1
thus	1
in	1
bed,	1
chatting	1
and	1
napping	1
at	1
short	1
intervals,	1
and	1
Queequeg	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
affectionately	1
throwing	1
his	1
brown	1
tattooed	1
legs	1
over	1
mine,	1
and	1
then	1
drawing	1
them	1
back;	1
so	1
entirely	1
sociable	1
and	1
free	1
and	1
easy	1
were	1
we;	1
when,	1
at	1
last,	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
our	1
confabulations,	1
what	1
little	1
nappishness	1
remained	1
in	1
us	1
altogether	1
departed,	1
and	1
we	1
felt	1
like	1
getting	1
up	1
again,	1
though	1
day-break	1
was	1
yet	1
some	1
way	1
down	1
the	1
future.	1
Yes,	1
we	1
became	1
very	1
wakeful;	1
so	1
much	1
so	1
that	1
our	1
recumbent	1
position	1
began	1
to	1
grow	1
wearisome,	1
and	1
by	1
little	1
and	1
little	1
we	1
found	1
ourselves	1
sitting	1
up;	1
the	1
clothes	1
well	1
tucked	1
around	1
us,	1
leaning	1
against	1
the	1
head-board	1
with	1
our	1
four	1
knees	1
drawn	1
up	1
close	1
together,	1
and	1
our	1
two	1
noses	1
bending	1
over	1
them,	1
as	1
if	1
our	1
kneepans	1
were	1
warming-pans.	1
We	1
felt	1
very	1
nice	1
and	1
snug,	1
the	1
more	1
so	1
since	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
chilly	1
out	1
of	1
doors;	1
indeed	1
out	1
of	1
bed-clothes	1
too,	1
seeing	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
fire	1
in	1
the	1
room.	1
The	1
more	1
so,	1
I	1
say,	1
because	1
truly	1
to	1
enjoy	1
bodily	1
warmth,	1
some	1
small	1
part	1
of	1
you	1
must	1
be	1
cold,	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
quality	1
in	1
this	1
world	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
merely	1
by	1
contrast.	1
Nothing	1
exists	1
in	1
itself.	1
If	1
you	1
flatter	1
yourself	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
all	1
over	1
comfortable,	1
and	1
have	1
been	1
so	1
a	1
long	1
time,	1
then	1
you	1
cannot	1
be	1
said	1
to	1
be	1
comfortable	1
any	1
more.	1
But	1
if,	1
like	1
Queequeg	1
and	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
bed,	1
the	1
tip	1
of	1
your	1
nose	1
or	1
the	1
crown	1
of	1
your	1
head	1
be	1
slightly	1
chilled,	1
why	1
then,	1
indeed,	1
in	1
the	1
general	1
consciousness	1
you	1
feel	1
most	1
delightfully	1
and	1
unmistakably	1
warm.	1
For	1
this	1
reason	1
a	1
sleeping	1
apartment	1
should	1
never	1
be	1
furnished	1
with	1
a	1
fire,	1
which	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
luxurious	1
discomforts	1
of	1
the	1
rich.	1
For	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
this	1
sort	1
of	1
deliciousness	1
is	1
to	1
have	1
nothing	1
but	1
the	1
blanket	1
between	1
you	1
and	1
your	1
snugness	1
and	1
the	1
cold	1
of	1
the	1
outer	1
air.	1
Then	1
there	1
you	1
lie	1
like	1
the	1
one	1
warm	1
spark	1
in	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
an	1
arctic	1
crystal.	1
We	1
had	1
been	1
sitting	1
in	1
this	1
crouching	1
manner	1
for	1
some	1
time,	1
when	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
I	1
thought	1
I	1
would	1
open	1
my	1
eyes;	1
for	1
when	1
between	1
sheets,	1
whether	1
by	1
day	1
or	1
by	1
night,	1
and	1
whether	1
asleep	1
or	1
awake,	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
way	1
of	1
always	1
keeping	1
my	1
eyes	1
shut,	1
in	1
order	1
the	1
more	1
to	1
concentrate	1
the	1
snugness	1
of	1
being	1
in	1
bed.	1
Because	1
no	1
man	1
can	1
ever	1
feel	1
his	1
own	1
identity	1
aright	1
except	1
his	1
eyes	1
be	1
closed;	1
as	1
if	1
darkness	1
were	1
indeed	1
the	1
proper	1
element	1
of	1
our	1
essences,	1
though	1
light	1
be	1
more	1
congenial	1
to	1
our	1
clayey	1
part.	1
Upon	1
opening	1
my	1
eyes	1
then,	1
and	1
coming	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
pleasant	1
and	1
self-created	1
darkness	1
into	1
the	1
imposed	1
and	1
coarse	1
outer	1
gloom	1
of	1
the	1
unilluminated	1
twelve-o'clock-at-night,	1
I	1
experienced	1
a	1
disagreeable	1
revulsion.	1
Nor	1
did	1
I	1
at	1
all	1
object	1
to	1
the	1
hint	1
from	1
Queequeg	1
that	1
perhaps	1
it	1
were	1
best	1
to	1
strike	1
a	1
light,	1
seeing	1
that	1
we	1
were	1
so	1
wide	1
awake;	1
and	1
besides	1
he	1
felt	1
a	1
strong	1
desire	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
few	1
quiet	1
puffs	1
from	1
his	1
Tomahawk.	1
Be	1
it	1
said,	1
that	1
though	1
I	1
had	1
felt	1
such	1
a	1
strong	1
repugnance	1
to	1
his	1
smoking	1
in	1
the	1
bed	1
the	1
night	1
before,	1
yet	1
see	1
how	1
elastic	1
our	1
stiff	1
prejudices	1
grow	1
when	1
love	1
once	1
comes	1
to	1
bend	1
them.	1
For	1
now	1
I	1
liked	1
nothing	1
better	1
than	1
to	1
have	1
Queequeg	1
smoking	1
by	1
me,	1
even	1
in	1
bed,	1
because	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
full	1
of	1
such	1
serene	1
household	1
joy	1
then.	1
I	1
no	1
more	1
felt	1
unduly	1
concerned	1
for	1
the	1
landlord's	1
policy	1
of	1
insurance.	1
I	1
was	1
only	1
alive	1
to	1
the	1
condensed	1
confidential	1
comfortableness	1
of	1
sharing	1
a	1
pipe	1
and	1
a	1
blanket	1
with	1
a	1
real	1
friend.	1
With	1
our	1
shaggy	1
jackets	1
drawn	1
about	1
our	1
shoulders,	1
we	1
now	1
passed	1
the	1
Tomahawk	1
from	1
one	1
to	1
the	1
other,	1
till	1
slowly	1
there	1
grew	1
over	1
us	1
a	1
blue	1
hanging	1
tester	1
of	1
smoke,	1
illuminated	1
by	1
the	1
flame	1
of	1
the	1
new-lit	1
lamp.	1
Whether	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
this	1
undulating	1
tester	1
rolled	1
the	1
savage	1
away	1
to	1
far	1
distant	1
scenes,	1
I	1
know	1
not,	1
but	1
he	1
now	1
spoke	1
of	1
his	1
native	1
island;	1
and,	1
eager	1
to	1
hear	1
his	1
history,	1
I	1
begged	1
him	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
and	1
tell	1
it.	1
He	1
gladly	1
complied.	1
Though	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
I	1
but	1
ill	1
comprehended	1
not	1
a	1
few	1
of	1
his	1
words,	1
yet	1
subsequent	1
disclosures,	1
when	1
I	1
had	1
become	1
more	1
familiar	1
with	1
his	1
broken	1
phraseology,	1
now	1
enable	1
me	1
to	1
present	1
the	1
whole	1
story	1
such	1
as	1
it	1
may	1
prove	1
in	1
the	1
mere	1
skeleton	1
I	1
give.	1
CHAPTER	1
12	1
Biographical.	1
Queequeg	1
was	1
a	1
native	1
of	1
Rokovoko,	1
an	1
island	1
far	1
away	1
to	1
the	1
West	1
and	1
South.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
down	1
in	1
any	1
map;	1
true	1
places	1
never	1
are.	1
When	1
a	1
new-hatched	1
savage	1
running	1
wild	1
about	1
his	1
native	1
woodlands	1
in	1
a	1
grass	1
clout,	1
followed	1
by	1
the	1
nibbling	1
goats,	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
a	1
green	1
sapling;	1
even	1
then,	1
in	1
Queequeg's	1
ambitious	1
soul,	1
lurked	1
a	1
strong	1
desire	1
to	1
see	1
something	1
more	1
of	1
Christendom	1
than	1
a	1
specimen	1
whaler	1
or	1
two.	1
His	1
father	1
was	1
a	1
High	1
Chief,	1
a	1
King;	1
his	1
uncle	1
a	1
High	1
Priest;	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
maternal	1
side	1
he	1
boasted	1
aunts	1
who	1
were	1
the	1
wives	1
of	1
unconquerable	1
warriors.	1
There	1
was	1
excellent	1
blood	1
in	1
his	1
veins--royal	1
stuff;	1
though	1
sadly	1
vitiated,	1
I	1
fear,	1
by	1
the	1
cannibal	1
propensity	1
he	1
nourished	1
in	1
his	1
untutored	1
youth.	1
A	1
Sag	1
Harbor	1
ship	1
visited	1
his	1
father's	1
bay,	1
and	1
Queequeg	1
sought	1
a	1
passage	1
to	1
Christian	1
lands.	1
But	1
the	1
ship,	1
having	1
her	1
full	1
complement	1
of	1
seamen,	1
spurned	1
his	1
suit;	1
and	1
not	1
all	1
the	1
King	1
his	1
father's	1
influence	1
could	1
prevail.	1
But	1
Queequeg	1
vowed	1
a	1
vow.	1
Alone	1
in	1
his	1
canoe,	1
he	1
paddled	1
off	1
to	1
a	1
distant	1
strait,	1
which	1
he	1
knew	1
the	1
ship	1
must	1
pass	1
through	1
when	1
she	1
quitted	1
the	1
island.	1
On	1
one	1
side	1
was	1
a	1
coral	1
reef;	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
a	1
low	1
tongue	1
of	1
land,	1
covered	1
with	1
mangrove	1
thickets	1
that	1
grew	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
water.	1
Hiding	1
his	1
canoe,	1
still	1
afloat,	1
among	1
these	1
thickets,	1
with	1
its	1
prow	1
seaward,	1
he	1
sat	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
stern,	1
paddle	1
low	1
in	1
hand;	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
ship	1
was	1
gliding	1
by,	1
like	1
a	1
flash	1
he	1
darted	1
out;	1
gained	1
her	1
side;	1
with	1
one	1
backward	1
dash	1
of	1
his	1
foot	1
capsized	1
and	1
sank	1
his	1
canoe;	1
climbed	1
up	1
the	1
chains;	1
and	1
throwing	1
himself	1
at	1
full	1
length	1
upon	1
the	1
deck,	1
grappled	1
a	1
ring-bolt	1
there,	1
and	1
swore	1
not	1
to	1
let	1
it	1
go,	1
though	1
hacked	1
in	1
pieces.	1
In	1
vain	1
the	1
captain	1
threatened	1
to	1
throw	1
him	1
overboard;	1
suspended	1
a	1
cutlass	1
over	1
his	1
naked	1
wrists;	1
Queequeg	1
was	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
a	1
King,	1
and	1
Queequeg	1
budged	1
not.	1
Struck	1
by	1
his	1
desperate	1
dauntlessness,	1
and	1
his	1
wild	1
desire	1
to	1
visit	1
Christendom,	1
the	1
captain	1
at	1
last	1
relented,	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
he	1
might	1
make	1
himself	1
at	1
home.	1
But	1
this	1
fine	1
young	1
savage--this	1
sea	1
Prince	1
of	1
Wales,	1
never	1
saw	1
the	1
Captain's	1
cabin.	1
They	1
put	1
him	1
down	1
among	1
the	1
sailors,	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
whaleman	1
of	1
him.	1
But	1
like	1
Czar	1
Peter	1
content	1
to	1
toil	1
in	1
the	1
shipyards	1
of	1
foreign	1
cities,	1
Queequeg	1
disdained	1
no	1
seeming	1
ignominy,	1
if	1
thereby	1
he	1
might	1
happily	1
gain	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
enlightening	1
his	1
untutored	1
countrymen.	1
For	1
at	1
bottom--so	1
he	1
told	1
me--he	1
was	1
actuated	1
by	1
a	1
profound	1
desire	1
to	1
learn	1
among	1
the	1
Christians,	1
the	1
arts	1
whereby	1
to	1
make	1
his	1
people	1
still	1
happier	1
than	1
they	1
were;	1
and	1
more	1
than	1
that,	1
still	1
better	1
than	1
they	1
were.	1
But,	1
alas!	1
the	1
practices	1
of	1
whalemen	1
soon	1
convinced	1
him	1
that	1
even	1
Christians	1
could	1
be	1
both	1
miserable	1
and	1
wicked;	1
infinitely	1
more	1
so,	1
than	1
all	1
his	1
father's	1
heathens.	1
Arrived	1
at	1
last	1
in	1
old	1
Sag	1
Harbor;	1
and	1
seeing	1
what	1
the	1
sailors	1
did	1
there;	1
and	1
then	1
going	1
on	1
to	1
Nantucket,	1
and	1
seeing	1
how	1
they	1
spent	1
their	1
wages	1
in	1
that	1
place	1
also,	1
poor	1
Queequeg	1
gave	1
it	1
up	1
for	1
lost.	1
Thought	1
he,	1
it's	1
a	1
wicked	1
world	1
in	1
all	1
meridians;	1
I'll	1
die	1
a	1
pagan.	1
And	1
thus	1
an	1
old	1
idolator	1
at	1
heart,	1
he	1
yet	1
lived	1
among	1
these	1
Christians,	1
wore	1
their	1
clothes,	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
talk	1
their	1
gibberish.	1
Hence	1
the	1
queer	1
ways	1
about	1
him,	1
though	1
now	1
some	1
time	1
from	1
home.	1
By	1
hints,	1
I	1
asked	1
him	1
whether	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
propose	1
going	1
back,	1
and	1
having	1
a	1
coronation;	1
since	1
he	1
might	1
now	1
consider	1
his	1
father	1
dead	1
and	1
gone,	1
he	1
being	1
very	1
old	1
and	1
feeble	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
accounts.	1
He	1
answered	1
no,	1
not	1
yet;	1
and	1
added	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
fearful	1
Christianity,	1
or	1
rather	1
Christians,	1
had	1
unfitted	1
him	1
for	1
ascending	1
the	1
pure	1
and	1
undefiled	1
throne	1
of	1
thirty	1
pagan	1
Kings	1
before	1
him.	1
But	1
by	1
and	1
by,	1
he	1
said,	1
he	1
would	1
return,--as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
felt	1
himself	1
baptized	1
again.	1
For	1
the	1
nonce,	1
however,	1
he	1
proposed	1
to	1
sail	1
about,	1
and	1
sow	1
his	1
wild	1
oats	1
in	1
all	1
four	1
oceans.	1
They	1
had	1
made	1
a	1
harpooneer	1
of	1
him,	1
and	1
that	1
barbed	1
iron	1
was	1
in	1
lieu	1
of	1
a	1
sceptre	1
now.	1
I	1
asked	1
him	1
what	1
might	1
be	1
his	1
immediate	1
purpose,	1
touching	1
his	1
future	1
movements.	1
He	1
answered,	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
sea	1
again,	1
in	1
his	1
old	1
vocation.	1
Upon	1
this,	1
I	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
whaling	1
was	1
my	1
own	1
design,	1
and	1
informed	1
him	1
of	1
my	1
intention	1
to	1
sail	1
out	1
of	1
Nantucket,	1
as	1
being	1
the	1
most	1
promising	1
port	1
for	1
an	1
adventurous	1
whaleman	1
to	1
embark	1
from.	1
He	1
at	1
once	1
resolved	1
to	1
accompany	1
me	1
to	1
that	1
island,	1
ship	1
aboard	1
the	1
same	1
vessel,	1
get	1
into	1
the	1
same	1
watch,	1
the	1
same	1
boat,	1
the	1
same	1
mess	1
with	1
me,	1
in	1
short	1
to	1
share	1
my	1
every	1
hap;	1
with	1
both	1
my	1
hands	1
in	1
his,	1
boldly	1
dip	1
into	1
the	1
Potluck	1
of	1
both	1
worlds.	1
To	1
all	1
this	1
I	1
joyously	1
assented;	1
for	1
besides	1
the	1
affection	1
I	1
now	1
felt	1
for	1
Queequeg,	1
he	1
was	1
an	1
experienced	1
harpooneer,	1
and	1
as	1
such,	1
could	1
not	1
fail	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
great	1
usefulness	1
to	1
one,	1
who,	1
like	1
me,	1
was	1
wholly	1
ignorant	1
of	1
the	1
mysteries	1
of	1
whaling,	1
though	1
well	1
acquainted	1
with	1
the	1
sea,	1
as	1
known	1
to	1
merchant	1
seamen.	1
His	1
story	1
being	1
ended	1
with	1
his	1
pipe's	1
last	1
dying	1
puff,	1
Queequeg	1
embraced	1
me,	1
pressed	1
his	1
forehead	1
against	1
mine,	1
and	1
blowing	1
out	1
the	1
light,	1
we	1
rolled	1
over	1
from	1
each	1
other,	1
this	1
way	1
and	1
that,	1
and	1
very	1
soon	1
were	1
sleeping.	1
CHAPTER	1
13	1
Wheelbarrow.	1
Next	1
morning,	1
Monday,	1
after	1
disposing	1
of	1
the	1
embalmed	1
head	1
to	1
a	1
barber,	1
for	1
a	1
block,	1
I	1
settled	1
my	1
own	1
and	1
comrade's	1
bill;	1
using,	1
however,	1
my	1
comrade's	1
money.	1
The	1
grinning	1
landlord,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
boarders,	1
seemed	1
amazingly	1
tickled	1
at	1
the	1
sudden	1
friendship	1
which	1
had	1
sprung	1
up	1
between	1
me	1
and	1
Queequeg--especially	1
as	1
Peter	1
Coffin's	1
cock	1
and	1
bull	1
stories	1
about	1
him	1
had	1
previously	1
so	1
much	1
alarmed	1
me	1
concerning	1
the	1
very	1
person	1
whom	1
I	1
now	1
companied	1
with.	1
We	1
borrowed	1
a	1
wheelbarrow,	1
and	1
embarking	1
our	1
things,	1
including	1
my	1
own	1
poor	1
carpet-bag,	1
and	1
Queequeg's	1
canvas	1
sack	1
and	1
hammock,	1
away	1
we	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
"the	1
Moss,"	1
the	1
little	1
Nantucket	1
packet	1
schooner	1
moored	1
at	1
the	1
wharf.	1
As	1
we	1
were	1
going	1
along	1
the	1
people	1
stared;	1
not	1
at	1
Queequeg	1
so	1
much--for	1
they	1
were	1
used	1
to	1
seeing	1
cannibals	1
like	1
him	1
in	1
their	1
streets,--but	1
at	1
seeing	1
him	1
and	1
me	1
upon	1
such	1
confidential	1
terms.	1
But	1
we	1
heeded	1
them	1
not,	1
going	1
along	1
wheeling	1
the	1
barrow	1
by	1
turns,	1
and	1
Queequeg	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
stopping	1
to	1
adjust	1
the	1
sheath	1
on	1
his	1
harpoon	1
barbs.	1
I	1
asked	1
him	1
why	1
he	1
carried	1
such	1
a	1
troublesome	1
thing	1
with	1
him	1
ashore,	1
and	1
whether	1
all	1
whaling	1
ships	1
did	1
not	1
find	1
their	1
own	1
harpoons.	1
To	1
this,	1
in	1
substance,	1
he	1
replied,	1
that	1
though	1
what	1
I	1
hinted	1
was	1
true	1
enough,	1
yet	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
particular	1
affection	1
for	1
his	1
own	1
harpoon,	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
of	1
assured	1
stuff,	1
well	1
tried	1
in	1
many	1
a	1
mortal	1
combat,	1
and	1
deeply	1
intimate	1
with	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
whales.	1
In	1
short,	1
like	1
many	1
inland	1
reapers	1
and	1
mowers,	1
who	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
farmers'	1
meadows	1
armed	1
with	1
their	1
own	1
scythes--though	1
in	1
no	1
wise	1
obliged	1
to	1
furnish	1
them--even	1
so,	1
Queequeg,	1
for	1
his	1
own	1
private	1
reasons,	1
preferred	1
his	1
own	1
harpoon.	1
Shifting	1
the	1
barrow	1
from	1
my	1
hand	1
to	1
his,	1
he	1
told	1
me	1
a	1
funny	1
story	1
about	1
the	1
first	1
wheelbarrow	1
he	1
had	1
ever	1
seen.	1
It	1
was	1
in	1
Sag	1
Harbor.	1
The	1
owners	1
of	1
his	1
ship,	1
it	1
seems,	1
had	1
lent	1
him	1
one,	1
in	1
which	1
to	1
carry	1
his	1
heavy	1
chest	1
to	1
his	1
boarding	1
house.	1
Not	1
to	1
seem	1
ignorant	1
about	1
the	1
thing--though	1
in	1
truth	1
he	1
was	1
entirely	1
so,	1
concerning	1
the	1
precise	1
way	1
in	1
which	1
to	1
manage	1
the	1
barrow--Queequeg	1
puts	1
his	1
chest	1
upon	1
it;	1
lashes	1
it	1
fast;	1
and	1
then	1
shoulders	1
the	1
barrow	1
and	1
marches	1
up	1
the	1
wharf.	1
"Why,"	1
said	1
I,	1
"Queequeg,	1
you	1
might	1
have	1
known	1
better	1
than	1
that,	1
one	1
would	1
think.	1
Didn't	1
the	1
people	1
laugh?"	1
Upon	1
this,	1
he	1
told	1
me	1
another	1
story.	1
The	1
people	1
of	1
his	1
island	1
of	1
Rokovoko,	1
it	1
seems,	1
at	1
their	1
wedding	1
feasts	1
express	1
the	1
fragrant	1
water	1
of	1
young	1
cocoanuts	1
into	1
a	1
large	1
stained	1
calabash	1
like	1
a	1
punchbowl;	1
and	1
this	1
punchbowl	1
always	1
forms	1
the	1
great	1
central	1
ornament	1
on	1
the	1
braided	1
mat	1
where	1
the	1
feast	1
is	1
held.	1
Now	1
a	1
certain	1
grand	1
merchant	1
ship	1
once	1
touched	1
at	1
Rokovoko,	1
and	1
its	1
commander--from	1
all	1
accounts,	1
a	1
very	1
stately	1
punctilious	1
gentleman,	1
at	1
least	1
for	1
a	1
sea	1
captain--this	1
commander	1
was	1
invited	1
to	1
the	1
wedding	1
feast	1
of	1
Queequeg's	1
sister,	1
a	1
pretty	1
young	1
princess	1
just	1
turned	1
of	1
ten.	1
Well;	1
when	1
all	1
the	1
wedding	1
guests	1
were	1
assembled	1
at	1
the	1
bride's	1
bamboo	1
cottage,	1
this	1
Captain	1
marches	1
in,	1
and	1
being	1
assigned	1
the	1
post	1
of	1
honour,	1
placed	1
himself	1
over	1
against	1
the	1
punchbowl,	1
and	1
between	1
the	1
High	1
Priest	1
and	1
his	1
majesty	1
the	1
King,	1
Queequeg's	1
father.	1
Grace	1
being	1
said,--for	1
those	1
people	1
have	1
their	1
grace	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
we--though	1
Queequeg	1
told	1
me	1
that	1
unlike	1
us,	1
who	1
at	1
such	1
times	1
look	1
downwards	1
to	1
our	1
platters,	1
they,	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
copying	1
the	1
ducks,	1
glance	1
upwards	1
to	1
the	1
great	1
Giver	1
of	1
all	1
feasts--Grace,	1
I	1
say,	1
being	1
said,	1
the	1
High	1
Priest	1
opens	1
the	1
banquet	1
by	1
the	1
immemorial	1
ceremony	1
of	1
the	1
island;	1
that	1
is,	1
dipping	1
his	1
consecrated	1
and	1
consecrating	1
fingers	1
into	1
the	1
bowl	1
before	1
the	1
blessed	1
beverage	1
circulates.	1
Seeing	1
himself	1
placed	1
next	1
the	1
Priest,	1
and	1
noting	1
the	1
ceremony,	1
and	1
thinking	1
himself--being	1
Captain	1
of	1
a	1
ship--as	1
having	1
plain	1
precedence	1
over	1
a	1
mere	1
island	1
King,	1
especially	1
in	1
the	1
King's	1
own	1
house--the	1
Captain	1
coolly	1
proceeds	1
to	1
wash	1
his	1
hands	1
in	1
the	1
punchbowl;--taking	1
it	1
I	1
suppose	1
for	1
a	1
huge	1
finger-glass.	1
"Now,"	1
said	1
Queequeg,	1
"what	1
you	1
tink	1
now?--Didn't	1
our	1
people	1
laugh?"	1
At	1
last,	1
passage	1
paid,	1
and	1
luggage	1
safe,	1
we	1
stood	1
on	1
board	1
the	1
schooner.	1
Hoisting	1
sail,	1
it	1
glided	1
down	1
the	1
Acushnet	1
river.	1
On	1
one	1
side,	1
New	1
Bedford	1
rose	1
in	1
terraces	1
of	1
streets,	1
their	1
ice-covered	1
trees	1
all	1
glittering	1
in	1
the	1
clear,	1
cold	1
air.	1
Huge	1
hills	1
and	1
mountains	1
of	1
casks	1
on	1
casks	1
were	1
piled	1
upon	1
her	1
wharves,	1
and	1
side	1
by	1
side	1
the	1
world-wandering	1
whale	1
ships	1
lay	1
silent	1
and	1
safely	1
moored	1
at	1
last;	1
while	1
from	1
others	1
came	1
a	1
sound	1
of	1
carpenters	1
and	1
coopers,	1
with	1
blended	1
noises	1
of	1
fires	1
and	1
forges	1
to	1
melt	1
the	1
pitch,	1
all	1
betokening	1
that	1
new	1
cruises	1
were	1
on	1
the	1
start;	1
that	1
one	1
most	1
perilous	1
and	1
long	1
voyage	1
ended,	1
only	1
begins	1
a	1
second;	1
and	1
a	1
second	1
ended,	1
only	1
begins	1
a	1
third,	1
and	1
so	1
on,	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
for	1
aye.	1
Such	1
is	1
the	1
endlessness,	1
yea,	1
the	1
intolerableness	1
of	1
all	1
earthly	1
effort.	1
Gaining	1
the	1
more	1
open	1
water,	1
the	1
bracing	1
breeze	1
waxed	1
fresh;	1
the	1
little	1
Moss	1
tossed	1
the	1
quick	1
foam	1
from	1
her	1
bows,	1
as	1
a	1
young	1
colt	1
his	1
snortings.	1
How	1
I	1
snuffed	1
that	1
Tartar	1
air!--how	1
I	1
spurned	1
that	1
turnpike	1
earth!--that	1
common	1
highway	1
all	1
over	1
dented	1
with	1
the	1
marks	1
of	1
slavish	1
heels	1
and	1
hoofs;	1
and	1
turned	1
me	1
to	1
admire	1
the	1
magnanimity	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
which	1
will	1
permit	1
no	1
records.	1
At	1
the	1
same	1
foam-fountain,	1
Queequeg	1
seemed	1
to	1
drink	1
and	1
reel	1
with	1
me.	1
His	1
dusky	1
nostrils	1
swelled	1
apart;	1
he	1
showed	1
his	1
filed	1
and	1
pointed	1
teeth.	1
On,	1
on	1
we	1
flew;	1
and	1
our	1
offing	1
gained,	1
the	1
Moss	1
did	1
homage	1
to	1
the	1
blast;	1
ducked	1
and	1
dived	1
her	1
bows	1
as	1
a	1
slave	1
before	1
the	1
Sultan.	1
Sideways	1
leaning,	1
we	1
sideways	1
darted;	1
every	1
ropeyarn	1
tingling	1
like	1
a	1
wire;	1
the	1
two	1
tall	1
masts	1
buckling	1
like	1
Indian	1
canes	1
in	1
land	1
tornadoes.	1
So	1
full	1
of	1
this	1
reeling	1
scene	1
were	1
we,	1
as	1
we	1
stood	1
by	1
the	1
plunging	1
bowsprit,	1
that	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
we	1
did	1
not	1
notice	1
the	1
jeering	1
glances	1
of	1
the	1
passengers,	1
a	1
lubber-like	1
assembly,	1
who	1
marvelled	1
that	1
two	1
fellow	1
beings	1
should	1
be	1
so	1
companionable;	1
as	1
though	1
a	1
white	1
man	1
were	1
anything	1
more	1
dignified	1
than	1
a	1
whitewashed	1
negro.	1
But	1
there	1
were	1
some	1
boobies	1
and	1
bumpkins	1
there,	1
who,	1
by	1
their	1
intense	1
greenness,	1
must	1
have	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
heart	1
and	1
centre	1
of	1
all	1
verdure.	1
Queequeg	1
caught	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
young	1
saplings	1
mimicking	1
him	1
behind	1
his	1
back.	1
I	1
thought	1
the	1
bumpkin's	1
hour	1
of	1
doom	1
was	1
come.	1
Dropping	1
his	1
harpoon,	1
the	1
brawny	1
savage	1
caught	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
arms,	1
and	1
by	1
an	1
almost	1
miraculous	1
dexterity	1
and	1
strength,	1
sent	1
him	1
high	1
up	1
bodily	1
into	1
the	1
air;	1
then	1
slightly	1
tapping	1
his	1
stern	1
in	1
mid-somerset,	1
the	1
fellow	1
landed	1
with	1
bursting	1
lungs	1
upon	1
his	1
feet,	1
while	1
Queequeg,	1
turning	1
his	1
back	1
upon	1
him,	1
lighted	1
his	1
tomahawk	1
pipe	1
and	1
passed	1
it	1
to	1
me	1
for	1
a	1
puff.	1
"Capting!	1
Capting!	1
yelled	1
the	1
bumpkin,	1
running	1
towards	1
that	1
officer;	1
"Capting,	1
Capting,	1
here's	1
the	1
devil."	1
"Hallo,	1
YOU	1
sir,"	1
cried	1
the	1
Captain,	1
a	1
gaunt	1
rib	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
stalking	1
up	1
to	1
Queequeg,	1
"what	1
in	1
thunder	1
do	1
you	1
mean	1
by	1
that?	1
Don't	1
you	1
know	1
you	1
might	1
have	1
killed	1
that	1
chap?"	1
"What	1
him	1
say?"	1
said	1
Queequeg,	1
as	1
he	1
mildly	1
turned	1
to	1
me.	1
"He	1
say,"	1
said	1
I,	1
"that	1
you	1
came	1
near	1
kill-e	1
that	1
man	1
there,"	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
still	1
shivering	1
greenhorn.	1
"Kill-e,"	1
cried	1
Queequeg,	1
twisting	1
his	1
tattooed	1
face	1
into	1
an	1
unearthly	1
expression	1
of	1
disdain,	1
"ah!	1
him	1
bevy	1
small-e	1
fish-e;	1
Queequeg	1
no	1
kill-e	1
so	1
small-e	1
fish-e;	1
Queequeg	1
kill-e	1
big	1
whale!"	1
"Look	1
you,"	1
roared	1
the	1
Captain,	1
"I'll	1
kill-e	1
YOU,	1
you	1
cannibal,	1
if	1
you	1
try	1
any	1
more	1
of	1
your	1
tricks	1
aboard	1
here;	1
so	1
mind	1
your	1
eye."	1
But	1
it	1
so	1
happened	1
just	1
then,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
high	1
time	1
for	1
the	1
Captain	1
to	1
mind	1
his	1
own	1
eye.	1
The	1
prodigious	1
strain	1
upon	1
the	1
main-sail	1
had	1
parted	1
the	1
weather-sheet,	1
and	1
the	1
tremendous	1
boom	1
was	1
now	1
flying	1
from	1
side	1
to	1
side,	1
completely	1
sweeping	1
the	1
entire	1
after	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
deck.	1
The	1
poor	1
fellow	1
whom	1
Queequeg	1
had	1
handled	1
so	1
roughly,	1
was	1
swept	1
overboard;	1
all	1
hands	1
were	1
in	1
a	1
panic;	1
and	1
to	1
attempt	1
snatching	1
at	1
the	1
boom	1
to	1
stay	1
it,	1
seemed	1
madness.	1
It	1
flew	1
from	1
right	1
to	1
left,	1
and	1
back	1
again,	1
almost	1
in	1
one	1
ticking	1
of	1
a	1
watch,	1
and	1
every	1
instant	1
seemed	1
on	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
snapping	1
into	1
splinters.	1
Nothing	1
was	1
done,	1
and	1
nothing	1
seemed	1
capable	1
of	1
being	1
done;	1
those	1
on	1
deck	1
rushed	1
towards	1
the	1
bows,	1
and	1
stood	1
eyeing	1
the	1
boom	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
the	1
lower	1
jaw	1
of	1
an	1
exasperated	1
whale.	1
In	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
this	1
consternation,	1
Queequeg	1
dropped	1
deftly	1
to	1
his	1
knees,	1
and	1
crawling	1
under	1
the	1
path	1
of	1
the	1
boom,	1
whipped	1
hold	1
of	1
a	1
rope,	1
secured	1
one	1
end	1
to	1
the	1
bulwarks,	1
and	1
then	1
flinging	1
the	1
other	1
like	1
a	1
lasso,	1
caught	1
it	1
round	1
the	1
boom	1
as	1
it	1
swept	1
over	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
next	1
jerk,	1
the	1
spar	1
was	1
that	1
way	1
trapped,	1
and	1
all	1
was	1
safe.	1
The	1
schooner	1
was	1
run	1
into	1
the	1
wind,	1
and	1
while	1
the	1
hands	1
were	1
clearing	1
away	1
the	1
stern	1
boat,	1
Queequeg,	1
stripped	1
to	1
the	1
waist,	1
darted	1
from	1
the	1
side	1
with	1
a	1
long	1
living	1
arc	1
of	1
a	1
leap.	1
For	1
three	1
minutes	1
or	1
more	1
he	1
was	1
seen	1
swimming	1
like	1
a	1
dog,	1
throwing	1
his	1
long	1
arms	1
straight	1
out	1
before	1
him,	1
and	1
by	1
turns	1
revealing	1
his	1
brawny	1
shoulders	1
through	1
the	1
freezing	1
foam.	1
I	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
grand	1
and	1
glorious	1
fellow,	1
but	1
saw	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
be	1
saved.	1
The	1
greenhorn	1
had	1
gone	1
down.	1
Shooting	1
himself	1
perpendicularly	1
from	1
the	1
water,	1
Queequeg,	1
now	1
took	1
an	1
instant's	1
glance	1
around	1
him,	1
and	1
seeming	1
to	1
see	1
just	1
how	1
matters	1
were,	1
dived	1
down	1
and	1
disappeared.	1
A	1
few	1
minutes	1
more,	1
and	1
he	1
rose	1
again,	1
one	1
arm	1
still	1
striking	1
out,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
other	1
dragging	1
a	1
lifeless	1
form.	1
The	1
boat	1
soon	1
picked	1
them	1
up.	1
The	1
poor	1
bumpkin	1
was	1
restored.	1
All	1
hands	1
voted	1
Queequeg	1
a	1
noble	1
trump;	1
the	1
captain	1
begged	1
his	1
pardon.	1
From	1
that	1
hour	1
I	1
clove	1
to	1
Queequeg	1
like	1
a	1
barnacle;	1
yea,	1
till	1
poor	1
Queequeg	1
took	1
his	1
last	1
long	1
dive.	1
Was	1
there	1
ever	1
such	1
unconsciousness?	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
he	1
at	1
all	1
deserved	1
a	1
medal	1
from	1
the	1
Humane	1
and	1
Magnanimous	1
Societies.	1
He	1
only	1
asked	1
for	1
water--fresh	1
water--something	1
to	1
wipe	1
the	1
brine	1
off;	1
that	1
done,	1
he	1
put	1
on	1
dry	1
clothes,	1
lighted	1
his	1
pipe,	1
and	1
leaning	1
against	1
the	1
bulwarks,	1
and	1
mildly	1
eyeing	1
those	1
around	1
him,	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
saying	1
to	1
himself--"It's	1
a	1
mutual,	1
joint-stock	1
world,	1
in	1
all	1
meridians.	1
We	1
cannibals	1
must	1
help	1
these	1
Christians."	1
CHAPTER	1
14	1
Nantucket.	1
Nothing	1
more	1
happened	1
on	1
the	1
passage	1
worthy	1
the	1
mentioning;	1
so,	1
after	1
a	1
fine	1
run,	1
we	1
safely	1
arrived	1
in	1
Nantucket.	1
Nantucket!	1
Take	1
out	1
your	1
map	1
and	1
look	1
at	1
it.	1
See	1
what	1
a	1
real	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
it	1
occupies;	1
how	1
it	1
stands	1
there,	1
away	1
off	1
shore,	1
more	1
lonely	1
than	1
the	1
Eddystone	1
lighthouse.	1
Look	1
at	1
it--a	1
mere	1
hillock,	1
and	1
elbow	1
of	1
sand;	1
all	1
beach,	1
without	1
a	1
background.	1
There	1
is	1
more	1
sand	1
there	1
than	1
you	1
would	1
use	1
in	1
twenty	1
years	1
as	1
a	1
substitute	1
for	1
blotting	1
paper.	1
Some	1
gamesome	1
wights	1
will	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
to	1
plant	1
weeds	1
there,	1
they	1
don't	1
grow	1
naturally;	1
that	1
they	1
import	1
Canada	1
thistles;	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
to	1
send	1
beyond	1
seas	1
for	1
a	1
spile	1
to	1
stop	1
a	1
leak	1
in	1
an	1
oil	1
cask;	1
that	1
pieces	1
of	1
wood	1
in	1
Nantucket	1
are	1
carried	1
about	1
like	1
bits	1
of	1
the	1
true	1
cross	1
in	1
Rome;	1
that	1
people	1
there	1
plant	1
toadstools	1
before	1
their	1
houses,	1
to	1
get	1
under	1
the	1
shade	1
in	1
summer	1
time;	1
that	1
one	1
blade	1
of	1
grass	1
makes	1
an	1
oasis,	1
three	1
blades	1
in	1
a	1
day's	1
walk	1
a	1
prairie;	1
that	1
they	1
wear	1
quicksand	1
shoes,	1
something	1
like	1
Laplander	1
snow-shoes;	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
so	1
shut	1
up,	1
belted	1
about,	1
every	1
way	1
inclosed,	1
surrounded,	1
and	1
made	1
an	1
utter	1
island	1
of	1
by	1
the	1
ocean,	1
that	1
to	1
their	1
very	1
chairs	1
and	1
tables	1
small	1
clams	1
will	1
sometimes	1
be	1
found	1
adhering,	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
backs	1
of	1
sea	1
turtles.	1
But	1
these	1
extravaganzas	1
only	1
show	1
that	1
Nantucket	1
is	1
no	1
Illinois.	1
Look	1
now	1
at	1
the	1
wondrous	1
traditional	1
story	1
of	1
how	1
this	1
island	1
was	1
settled	1
by	1
the	1
red-men.	1
Thus	1
goes	1
the	1
legend.	1
In	1
olden	1
times	1
an	1
eagle	1
swooped	1
down	1
upon	1
the	1
New	1
England	1
coast,	1
and	1
carried	1
off	1
an	1
infant	1
Indian	1
in	1
his	1
talons.	1
With	1
loud	1
lament	1
the	1
parents	1
saw	1
their	1
child	1
borne	1
out	1
of	1
sight	1
over	1
the	1
wide	1
waters.	1
They	1
resolved	1
to	1
follow	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
direction.	1
Setting	1
out	1
in	1
their	1
canoes,	1
after	1
a	1
perilous	1
passage	1
they	1
discovered	1
the	1
island,	1
and	1
there	1
they	1
found	1
an	1
empty	1
ivory	1
casket,--the	1
poor	1
little	1
Indian's	1
skeleton.	1
What	1
wonder,	1
then,	1
that	1
these	1
Nantucketers,	1
born	1
on	1
a	1
beach,	1
should	1
take	1
to	1
the	1
sea	1
for	1
a	1
livelihood!	1
They	1
first	1
caught	1
crabs	1
and	1
quohogs	1
in	1
the	1
sand;	1
grown	1
bolder,	1
they	1
waded	1
out	1
with	1
nets	1
for	1
mackerel;	1
more	1
experienced,	1
they	1
pushed	1
off	1
in	1
boats	1
and	1
captured	1
cod;	1
and	1
at	1
last,	1
launching	1
a	1
navy	1
of	1
great	1
ships	1
on	1
the	1
sea,	1
explored	1
this	1
watery	1
world;	1
put	1
an	1
incessant	1
belt	1
of	1
circumnavigations	1
round	1
it;	1
peeped	1
in	1
at	1
Behring's	1
Straits;	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
seasons	1
and	1
all	1
oceans	1
declared	1
everlasting	1
war	1
with	1
the	1
mightiest	1
animated	1
mass	1
that	1
has	1
survived	1
the	1
flood;	1
most	1
monstrous	1
and	1
most	1
mountainous!	1
That	1
Himmalehan,	1
salt-sea	1
Mastodon,	1
clothed	1
with	1
such	1
portentousness	1
of	1
unconscious	1
power,	1
that	1
his	1
very	1
panics	1
are	1
more	1
to	1
be	1
dreaded	1
than	1
his	1
most	1
fearless	1
and	1
malicious	1
assaults!	1
And	1
thus	1
have	1
these	1
naked	1
Nantucketers,	1
these	1
sea	1
hermits,	1
issuing	1
from	1
their	1
ant-hill	1
in	1
the	1
sea,	1
overrun	1
and	1
conquered	1
the	1
watery	1
world	1
like	1
so	1
many	1
Alexanders;	1
parcelling	1
out	1
among	1
them	1
the	1
Atlantic,	1
Pacific,	1
and	1
Indian	1
oceans,	1
as	1
the	1
three	1
pirate	1
powers	1
did	1
Poland.	1
Let	1
America	1
add	1
Mexico	1
to	1
Texas,	1
and	1
pile	1
Cuba	1
upon	1
Canada;	1
let	1
the	1
English	1
overswarm	1
all	1
India,	1
and	1
hang	1
out	1
their	1
blazing	1
banner	1
from	1
the	1
sun;	1
two	1
thirds	1
of	1
this	1
terraqueous	1
globe	1
are	1
the	1
Nantucketer's.	1
For	1
the	1
sea	1
is	1
his;	1
he	1
owns	1
it,	1
as	1
Emperors	1
own	1
empires;	1
other	1
seamen	1
having	1
but	1
a	1
right	1
of	1
way	1
through	1
it.	1
Merchant	1
ships	1
are	1
but	1
extension	1
bridges;	1
armed	1
ones	1
but	1
floating	1
forts;	1
even	1
pirates	1
and	1
privateers,	1
though	1
following	1
the	1
sea	1
as	1
highwaymen	1
the	1
road,	1
they	1
but	1
plunder	1
other	1
ships,	1
other	1
fragments	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
like	1
themselves,	1
without	1
seeking	1
to	1
draw	1
their	1
living	1
from	1
the	1
bottomless	1
deep	1
itself.	1
The	1
Nantucketer,	1
he	1
alone	1
resides	1
and	1
riots	1
on	1
the	1
sea;	1
he	1
alone,	1
in	1
Bible	1
language,	1
goes	1
down	1
to	1
it	1
in	1
ships;	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
ploughing	1
it	1
as	1
his	1
own	1
special	1
plantation.	1
THERE	1
is	1
his	1
home;	1
THERE	1
lies	1
his	1
business,	1
which	1
a	1
Noah's	1
flood	1
would	1
not	1
interrupt,	1
though	1
it	1
overwhelmed	1
all	1
the	1
millions	1
in	1
China.	1
He	1
lives	1
on	1
the	1
sea,	1
as	1
prairie	1
cocks	1
in	1
the	1
prairie;	1
he	1
hides	1
among	1
the	1
waves,	1
he	1
climbs	1
them	1
as	1
chamois	1
hunters	1
climb	1
the	1
Alps.	1
For	1
years	1
he	1
knows	1
not	1
the	1
land;	1
so	1
that	1
when	1
he	1
comes	1
to	1
it	1
at	1
last,	1
it	1
smells	1
like	1
another	1
world,	1
more	1
strangely	1
than	1
the	1
moon	1
would	1
to	1
an	1
Earthsman.	1
With	1
the	1
landless	1
gull,	1
that	1
at	1
sunset	1
folds	1
her	1
wings	1
and	1
is	1
rocked	1
to	1
sleep	1
between	1
billows;	1
so	1
at	1
nightfall,	1
the	1
Nantucketer,	1
out	1
of	1
sight	1
of	1
land,	1
furls	1
his	1
sails,	1
and	1
lays	1
him	1
to	1
his	1
rest,	1
while	1
under	1
his	1
very	1
pillow	1
rush	1
herds	1
of	1
walruses	1
and	1
whales.	1
CHAPTER	1
15	1
Chowder.	1
It	1
was	1
quite	1
late	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
when	1
the	1
little	1
Moss	1
came	1
snugly	1
to	1
anchor,	1
and	1
Queequeg	1
and	1
I	1
went	1
ashore;	1
so	1
we	1
could	1
attend	1
to	1
no	1
business	1
that	1
day,	1
at	1
least	1
none	1
but	1
a	1
supper	1
and	1
a	1
bed.	1
The	1
landlord	1
of	1
the	1
Spouter-Inn	1
had	1
recommended	1
us	1
to	1
his	1
cousin	1
Hosea	1
Hussey	1
of	1
the	1
Try	1
Pots,	1
whom	1
he	1
asserted	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
proprietor	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
kept	1
hotels	1
in	1
all	1
Nantucket,	1
and	1
moreover	1
he	1
had	1
assured	1
us	1
that	1
Cousin	1
Hosea,	1
as	1
he	1
called	1
him,	1
was	1
famous	1
for	1
his	1
chowders.	1
In	1
short,	1
he	1
plainly	1
hinted	1
that	1
we	1
could	1
not	1
possibly	1
do	1
better	1
than	1
try	1
pot-luck	1
at	1
the	1
Try	1
Pots.	1
But	1
the	1
directions	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
us	1
about	1
keeping	1
a	1
yellow	1
warehouse	1
on	1
our	1
starboard	1
hand	1
till	1
we	1
opened	1
a	1
white	1
church	1
to	1
the	1
larboard,	1
and	1
then	1
keeping	1
that	1
on	1
the	1
larboard	1
hand	1
till	1
we	1
made	1
a	1
corner	1
three	1
points	1
to	1
the	1
starboard,	1
and	1
that	1
done,	1
then	1
ask	1
the	1
first	1
man	1
we	1
met	1
where	1
the	1
place	1
was:	1
these	1
crooked	1
directions	1
of	1
his	1
very	1
much	1
puzzled	1
us	1
at	1
first,	1
especially	1
as,	1
at	1
the	1
outset,	1
Queequeg	1
insisted	1
that	1
the	1
yellow	1
warehouse--our	1
first	1
point	1
of	1
departure--must	1
be	1
left	1
on	1
the	1
larboard	1
hand,	1
whereas	1
I	1
had	1
understood	1
Peter	1
Coffin	1
to	1
say	1
it	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
starboard.	1
However,	1
by	1
dint	1
of	1
beating	1
about	1
a	1
little	1
in	1
the	1
dark,	1
and	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
knocking	1
up	1
a	1
peaceable	1
inhabitant	1
to	1
inquire	1
the	1
way,	1
we	1
at	1
last	1
came	1
to	1
something	1
which	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
mistaking.	1
Two	1
enormous	1
wooden	1
pots	1
painted	1
black,	1
and	1
suspended	1
by	1
asses'	1
ears,	1
swung	1
from	1
the	1
cross-trees	1
of	1
an	1
old	1
top-mast,	1
planted	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
an	1
old	1
doorway.	1
The	1
horns	1
of	1
the	1
cross-trees	1
were	1
sawed	1
off	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side,	1
so	1
that	1
this	1
old	1
top-mast	1
looked	1
not	1
a	1
little	1
like	1
a	1
gallows.	1
Perhaps	1
I	1
was	1
over	1
sensitive	1
to	1
such	1
impressions	1
at	1
the	1
time,	1
but	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
staring	1
at	1
this	1
gallows	1
with	1
a	1
vague	1
misgiving.	1
A	1
sort	1
of	1
crick	1
was	1
in	1
my	1
neck	1
as	1
I	1
gazed	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
two	1
remaining	1
horns;	1
yes,	1
TWO	1
of	1
them,	1
one	1
for	1
Queequeg,	1
and	1
one	1
for	1
me.	1
It's	1
ominous,	1
thinks	1
I.	1
A	1
Coffin	1
my	1
Innkeeper	1
upon	1
landing	1
in	1
my	1
first	1
whaling	1
port;	1
tombstones	1
staring	1
at	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
whalemen's	1
chapel;	1
and	1
here	1
a	1
gallows!	1
and	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
prodigious	1
black	1
pots	1
too!	1
Are	1
these	1
last	1
throwing	1
out	1
oblique	1
hints	1
touching	1
Tophet?	1
I	1
was	1
called	1
from	1
these	1
reflections	1
by	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
a	1
freckled	1
woman	1
with	1
yellow	1
hair	1
and	1
a	1
yellow	1
gown,	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
porch	1
of	1
the	1
inn,	1
under	1
a	1
dull	1
red	1
lamp	1
swinging	1
there,	1
that	1
looked	1
much	1
like	1
an	1
injured	1
eye,	1
and	1
carrying	1
on	1
a	1
brisk	1
scolding	1
with	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
a	1
purple	1
woollen	1
shirt.	1
"Get	1
along	1
with	1
ye,"	1
said	1
she	1
to	1
the	1
man,	1
"or	1
I'll	1
be	1
combing	1
ye!"	1
"Come	1
on,	1
Queequeg,"	1
said	1
I,	1
"all	1
right.	1
There's	1
Mrs.	1
Hussey."	1
And	1
so	1
it	1
turned	1
out;	1
Mr.	1
Hosea	1
Hussey	1
being	1
from	1
home,	1
but	1
leaving	1
Mrs.	1
Hussey	1
entirely	1
competent	1
to	1
attend	1
to	1
all	1
his	1
affairs.	1
Upon	1
making	1
known	1
our	1
desires	1
for	1
a	1
supper	1
and	1
a	1
bed,	1
Mrs.	1
Hussey,	1
postponing	1
further	1
scolding	1
for	1
the	1
present,	1
ushered	1
us	1
into	1
a	1
little	1
room,	1
and	1
seating	1
us	1
at	1
a	1
table	1
spread	1
with	1
the	1
relics	1
of	1
a	1
recently	1
concluded	1
repast,	1
turned	1
round	1
to	1
us	1
and	1
said--"Clam	1
or	1
Cod?"	1
"What's	1
that	1
about	1
Cods,	1
ma'am?"	1
said	1
I,	1
with	1
much	1
politeness.	1
"Clam	1
or	1
Cod?"	1
she	1
repeated.	1
"A	1
clam	1
for	1
supper?	1
a	1
cold	1
clam;	1
is	1
THAT	1
what	1
you	1
mean,	1
Mrs.	1
Hussey?"	1
says	1
I,	1
"but	1
that's	1
a	1
rather	1
cold	1
and	1
clammy	1
reception	1
in	1
the	1
winter	1
time,	1
ain't	1
it,	1
Mrs.	1
Hussey?"	1
But	1
being	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
hurry	1
to	1
resume	1
scolding	1
the	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
purple	1
Shirt,	1
who	1
was	1
waiting	1
for	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
entry,	1
and	1
seeming	1
to	1
hear	1
nothing	1
but	1
the	1
word	1
"clam,"	1
Mrs.	1
Hussey	1
hurried	1
towards	1
an	1
open	1
door	1
leading	1
to	1
the	1
kitchen,	1
and	1
bawling	1
out	1
"clam	1
for	1
two,"	1
disappeared.	1
"Queequeg,"	1
said	1
I,	1
"do	1
you	1
think	1
that	1
we	1
can	1
make	1
out	1
a	1
supper	1
for	1
us	1
both	1
on	1
one	1
clam?"	1
However,	1
a	1
warm	1
savory	1
steam	1
from	1
the	1
kitchen	1
served	1
to	1
belie	1
the	1
apparently	1
cheerless	1
prospect	1
before	1
us.	1
But	1
when	1
that	1
smoking	1
chowder	1
came	1
in,	1
the	1
mystery	1
was	1
delightfully	1
explained.	1
Oh,	1
sweet	1
friends!	1
hearken	1
to	1
me.	1
It	1
was	1
made	1
of	1
small	1
juicy	1
clams,	1
scarcely	1
bigger	1
than	1
hazel	1
nuts,	1
mixed	1
with	1
pounded	1
ship	1
biscuit,	1
and	1
salted	1
pork	1
cut	1
up	1
into	1
little	1
flakes;	1
the	1
whole	1
enriched	1
with	1
butter,	1
and	1
plentifully	1
seasoned	1
with	1
pepper	1
and	1
salt.	1
Our	1
appetites	1
being	1
sharpened	1
by	1
the	1
frosty	1
voyage,	1
and	1
in	1
particular,	1
Queequeg	1
seeing	1
his	1
favourite	1
fishing	1
food	1
before	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
chowder	1
being	1
surpassingly	1
excellent,	1
we	1
despatched	1
it	1
with	1
great	1
expedition:	1
when	1
leaning	1
back	1
a	1
moment	1
and	1
bethinking	1
me	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
Hussey's	1
clam	1
and	1
cod	1
announcement,	1
I	1
thought	1
I	1
would	1
try	1
a	1
little	1
experiment.	1
Stepping	1
to	1
the	1
kitchen	1
door,	1
I	1
uttered	1
the	1
word	1
"cod"	1
with	1
great	1
emphasis,	1
and	1
resumed	1
my	1
seat.	1
In	1
a	1
few	1
moments	1
the	1
savoury	1
steam	1
came	1
forth	1
again,	1
but	1
with	1
a	1
different	1
flavor,	1
and	1
in	1
good	1
time	1
a	1
fine	1
cod-chowder	1
was	1
placed	1
before	1
us.	1
We	1
resumed	1
business;	1
and	1
while	1
plying	1
our	1
spoons	1
in	1
the	1
bowl,	1
thinks	1
I	1
to	1
myself,	1
I	1
wonder	1
now	1
if	1
this	1
here	1
has	1
any	1
effect	1
on	1
the	1
head?	1
What's	1
that	1
stultifying	1
saying	1
about	1
chowder-headed	1
people?	1
"But	1
look,	1
Queequeg,	1
ain't	1
that	1
a	1
live	1
eel	1
in	1
your	1
bowl?	1
Where's	1
your	1
harpoon?"	1
Fishiest	1
of	1
all	1
fishy	1
places	1
was	1
the	1
Try	1
Pots,	1
which	1
well	1
deserved	1
its	1
name;	1
for	1
the	1
pots	1
there	1
were	1
always	1
boiling	1
chowders.	1
Chowder	1
for	1
breakfast,	1
and	1
chowder	1
for	1
dinner,	1
and	1
chowder	1
for	1
supper,	1
till	1
you	1
began	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
fish-bones	1
coming	1
through	1
your	1
clothes.	1
The	1
area	1
before	1
the	1
house	1
was	1
paved	1
with	1
clam-shells.	1
Mrs.	1
Hussey	1
wore	1
a	1
polished	1
necklace	1
of	1
codfish	1
vertebra;	1
and	1
Hosea	1
Hussey	1
had	1
his	1
account	1
books	1
bound	1
in	1
superior	1
old	1
shark-skin.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
fishy	1
flavor	1
to	1
the	1
milk,	1
too,	1
which	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
account	1
for,	1
till	1
one	1
morning	1
happening	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
stroll	1
along	1
the	1
beach	1
among	1
some	1
fishermen's	1
boats,	1
I	1
saw	1
Hosea's	1
brindled	1
cow	1
feeding	1
on	1
fish	1
remnants,	1
and	1
marching	1
along	1
the	1
sand	1
with	1
each	1
foot	1
in	1
a	1
cod's	1
decapitated	1
head,	1
looking	1
very	1
slip-shod,	1
I	1
assure	1
ye.	1
Supper	1
concluded,	1
we	1
received	1
a	1
lamp,	1
and	1
directions	1
from	1
Mrs.	1
Hussey	1
concerning	1
the	1
nearest	1
way	1
to	1
bed;	1
but,	1
as	1
Queequeg	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
precede	1
me	1
up	1
the	1
stairs,	1
the	1
lady	1
reached	1
forth	1
her	1
arm,	1
and	1
demanded	1
his	1
harpoon;	1
she	1
allowed	1
no	1
harpoon	1
in	1
her	1
chambers.	1
"Why	1
not?	1
said	1
I;	1
"every	1
true	1
whaleman	1
sleeps	1
with	1
his	1
harpoon--but	1
why	1
not?"	1
"Because	1
it's	1
dangerous,"	1
says	1
she.	1
"Ever	1
since	1
young	1
Stiggs	1
coming	1
from	1
that	1
unfort'nt	1
v'y'ge	1
of	1
his,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
gone	1
four	1
years	1
and	1
a	1
half,	1
with	1
only	1
three	1
barrels	1
of	1
ILE,	1
was	1
found	1
dead	1
in	1
my	1
first	1
floor	1
back,	1
with	1
his	1
harpoon	1
in	1
his	1
side;	1
ever	1
since	1
then	1
I	1
allow	1
no	1
boarders	1
to	1
take	1
sich	1
dangerous	1
weepons	1
in	1
their	1
rooms	1
at	1
night.	1
So,	1
Mr.	1
Queequeg"	1
(for	1
she	1
had	1
learned	1
his	1
name),	1
"I	1
will	1
just	1
take	1
this	1
here	1
iron,	1
and	1
keep	1
it	1
for	1
you	1
till	1
morning.	1
But	1
the	1
chowder;	1
clam	1
or	1
cod	1
to-morrow	1
for	1
breakfast,	1
men?"	1
"Both,"	1
says	1
I;	1
"and	1
let's	1
have	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
smoked	1
herring	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
variety."	1
CHAPTER	1
16	1
The	1
Ship.	1
In	1
bed	1
we	1
concocted	1
our	1
plans	1
for	1
the	1
morrow.	1
But	1
to	1
my	1
surprise	1
and	1
no	1
small	1
concern,	1
Queequeg	1
now	1
gave	1
me	1
to	1
understand,	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
diligently	1
consulting	1
Yojo--the	1
name	1
of	1
his	1
black	1
little	1
god--and	1
Yojo	1
had	1
told	1
him	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
times	1
over,	1
and	1
strongly	1
insisted	1
upon	1
it	1
everyway,	1
that	1
instead	1
of	1
our	1
going	1
together	1
among	1
the	1
whaling-fleet	1
in	1
harbor,	1
and	1
in	1
concert	1
selecting	1
our	1
craft;	1
instead	1
of	1
this,	1
I	1
say,	1
Yojo	1
earnestly	1
enjoined	1
that	1
the	1
selection	1
of	1
the	1
ship	1
should	1
rest	1
wholly	1
with	1
me,	1
inasmuch	1
as	1
Yojo	1
purposed	1
befriending	1
us;	1
and,	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
do	1
so,	1
had	1
already	1
pitched	1
upon	1
a	1
vessel,	1
which,	1
if	1
left	1
to	1
myself,	1
I,	1
Ishmael,	1
should	1
infallibly	1
light	1
upon,	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
as	1
though	1
it	1
had	1
turned	1
out	1
by	1
chance;	1
and	1
in	1
that	1
vessel	1
I	1
must	1
immediately	1
ship	1
myself,	1
for	1
the	1
present	1
irrespective	1
of	1
Queequeg.	1
I	1
have	1
forgotten	1
to	1
mention	1
that,	1
in	1
many	1
things,	1
Queequeg	1
placed	1
great	1
confidence	1
in	1
the	1
excellence	1
of	1
Yojo's	1
judgment	1
and	1
surprising	1
forecast	1
of	1
things;	1
and	1
cherished	1
Yojo	1
with	1
considerable	1
esteem,	1
as	1
a	1
rather	1
good	1
sort	1
of	1
god,	1
who	1
perhaps	1
meant	1
well	1
enough	1
upon	1
the	1
whole,	1
but	1
in	1
all	1
cases	1
did	1
not	1
succeed	1
in	1
his	1
benevolent	1
designs.	1
Now,	1
this	1
plan	1
of	1
Queequeg's,	1
or	1
rather	1
Yojo's,	1
touching	1
the	1
selection	1
of	1
our	1
craft;	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
that	1
plan	1
at	1
all.	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
a	1
little	1
relied	1
upon	1
Queequeg's	1
sagacity	1
to	1
point	1
out	1
the	1
whaler	1
best	1
fitted	1
to	1
carry	1
us	1
and	1
our	1
fortunes	1
securely.	1
But	1
as	1
all	1
my	1
remonstrances	1
produced	1
no	1
effect	1
upon	1
Queequeg,	1
I	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
acquiesce;	1
and	1
accordingly	1
prepared	1
to	1
set	1
about	1
this	1
business	1
with	1
a	1
determined	1
rushing	1
sort	1
of	1
energy	1
and	1
vigor,	1
that	1
should	1
quickly	1
settle	1
that	1
trifling	1
little	1
affair.	1
Next	1
morning	1
early,	1
leaving	1
Queequeg	1
shut	1
up	1
with	1
Yojo	1
in	1
our	1
little	1
bedroom--for	1
it	1
seemed	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
some	1
sort	1
of	1
Lent	1
or	1
Ramadan,	1
or	1
day	1
of	1
fasting,	1
humiliation,	1
and	1
prayer	1
with	1
Queequeg	1
and	1
Yojo	1
that	1
day;	1
HOW	1
it	1
was	1
I	1
never	1
could	1
find	1
out,	1
for,	1
though	1
I	1
applied	1
myself	1
to	1
it	1
several	1
times,	1
I	1
never	1
could	1
master	1
his	1
liturgies	1
and	1
XXXIX	1
Articles--leaving	1
Queequeg,	1
then,	1
fasting	1
on	1
his	1
tomahawk	1
pipe,	1
and	1
Yojo	1
warming	1
himself	1
at	1
his	1
sacrificial	1
fire	1
of	1
shavings,	1
I	1
sallied	1
out	1
among	1
the	1
shipping.	1
After	1
much	1
prolonged	1
sauntering	1
and	1
many	1
random	1
inquiries,	1
I	1
learnt	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
three	1
ships	1
up	1
for	1
three-years'	1
voyages--The	1
Devil-dam,	1
the	1
Tit-bit,	1
and	1
the	1
Pequod.	1
DEVIL-DAM,	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
the	1
origin	1
of;	1
TIT-BIT	1
is	1
obvious;	1
PEQUOD,	1
you	1
will	1
no	1
doubt	1
remember,	1
was	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
a	1
celebrated	1
tribe	1
of	1
Massachusetts	1
Indians;	1
now	1
extinct	1
as	1
the	1
ancient	1
Medes.	1
I	1
peered	1
and	1
pryed	1
about	1
the	1
Devil-dam;	1
from	1
her,	1
hopped	1
over	1
to	1
the	1
Tit-bit;	1
and	1
finally,	1
going	1
on	1
board	1
the	1
Pequod,	1
looked	1
around	1
her	1
for	1
a	1
moment,	1
and	1
then	1
decided	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
very	1
ship	1
for	1
us.	1
You	1
may	1
have	1
seen	1
many	1
a	1
quaint	1
craft	1
in	1
your	1
day,	1
for	1
aught	1
I	1
know;--square-toed	1
luggers;	1
mountainous	1
Japanese	1
junks;	1
butter-box	1
galliots,	1
and	1
what	1
not;	1
but	1
take	1
my	1
word	1
for	1
it,	1
you	1
never	1
saw	1
such	1
a	1
rare	1
old	1
craft	1
as	1
this	1
same	1
rare	1
old	1
Pequod.	1
She	1
was	1
a	1
ship	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
school,	1
rather	1
small	1
if	1
anything;	1
with	1
an	1
old-fashioned	1
claw-footed	1
look	1
about	1
her.	1
Long	1
seasoned	1
and	1
weather-stained	1
in	1
the	1
typhoons	1
and	1
calms	1
of	1
all	1
four	1
oceans,	1
her	1
old	1
hull's	1
complexion	1
was	1
darkened	1
like	1
a	1
French	1
grenadier's,	1
who	1
has	1
alike	1
fought	1
in	1
Egypt	1
and	1
Siberia.	1
Her	1
venerable	1
bows	1
looked	1
bearded.	1
Her	1
masts--cut	1
somewhere	1
on	1
the	1
coast	1
of	1
Japan,	1
where	1
her	1
original	1
ones	1
were	1
lost	1
overboard	1
in	1
a	1
gale--her	1
masts	1
stood	1
stiffly	1
up	1
like	1
the	1
spines	1
of	1
the	1
three	1
old	1
kings	1
of	1
Cologne.	1
Her	1
ancient	1
decks	1
were	1
worn	1
and	1
wrinkled,	1
like	1
the	1
pilgrim-worshipped	1
flag-stone	1
in	1
Canterbury	1
Cathedral	1
where	1
Becket	1
bled.	1
But	1
to	1
all	1
these	1
her	1
old	1
antiquities,	1
were	1
added	1
new	1
and	1
marvellous	1
features,	1
pertaining	1
to	1
the	1
wild	1
business	1
that	1
for	1
more	1
than	1
half	1
a	1
century	1
she	1
had	1
followed.	1
Old	1
Captain	1
Peleg,	1
many	1
years	1
her	1
chief-mate,	1
before	1
he	1
commanded	1
another	1
vessel	1
of	1
his	1
own,	1
and	1
now	1
a	1
retired	1
seaman,	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
principal	1
owners	1
of	1
the	1
Pequod,--this	1
old	1
Peleg,	1
during	1
the	1
term	1
of	1
his	1
chief-mateship,	1
had	1
built	1
upon	1
her	1
original	1
grotesqueness,	1
and	1
inlaid	1
it,	1
all	1
over,	1
with	1
a	1
quaintness	1
both	1
of	1
material	1
and	1
device,	1
unmatched	1
by	1
anything	1
except	1
it	1
be	1
Thorkill-Hake's	1
carved	1
buckler	1
or	1
bedstead.	1
She	1
was	1
apparelled	1
like	1
any	1
barbaric	1
Ethiopian	1
emperor,	1
his	1
neck	1
heavy	1
with	1
pendants	1
of	1
polished	1
ivory.	1
She	1
was	1
a	1
thing	1
of	1
trophies.	1
A	1
cannibal	1
of	1
a	1
craft,	1
tricking	1
herself	1
forth	1
in	1
the	1
chased	1
bones	1
of	1
her	1
enemies.	1
All	1
round,	1
her	1
unpanelled,	1
open	1
bulwarks	1
were	1
garnished	1
like	1
one	1
continuous	1
jaw,	1
with	1
the	1
long	1
sharp	1
teeth	1
of	1
the	1
sperm	1
whale,	1
inserted	1
there	1
for	1
pins,	1
to	1
fasten	1
her	1
old	1
hempen	1
thews	1
and	1
tendons	1
to.	1
Those	1
thews	1
ran	1
not	1
through	1
base	1
blocks	1
of	1
land	1
wood,	1
but	1
deftly	1
travelled	1
over	1
sheaves	1
of	1
sea-ivory.	1
Scorning	1
a	1
turnstile	1
wheel	1
at	1
her	1
reverend	1
helm,	1
she	1
sported	1
there	1
a	1
tiller;	1
and	1
that	1
tiller	1
was	1
in	1
one	1
mass,	1
curiously	1
carved	1
from	1
the	1
long	1
narrow	1
lower	1
jaw	1
of	1
her	1
hereditary	1
foe.	1
The	1
helmsman	1
who	1
steered	1
by	1
that	1
tiller	1
in	1
a	1
tempest,	1
felt	1
like	1
the	1
Tartar,	1
when	1
he	1
holds	1
back	1
his	1
fiery	1
steed	1
by	1
clutching	1
its	1
jaw.	1
A	1
noble	1
craft,	1
but	1
somehow	1
a	1
most	1
melancholy!	1
All	1
noble	1
things	1
are	1
touched	1
with	1
that.	1
Now	1
when	1
I	1
looked	1
about	1
the	1
quarter-deck,	1
for	1
some	1
one	1
having	1
authority,	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
propose	1
myself	1
as	1
a	1
candidate	1
for	1
the	1
voyage,	1
at	1
first	1
I	1
saw	1
nobody;	1
but	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
well	1
overlook	1
a	1
strange	1
sort	1
of	1
tent,	1
or	1
rather	1
wigwam,	1
pitched	1
a	1
little	1
behind	1
the	1
main-mast.	1
It	1
seemed	1
only	1
a	1
temporary	1
erection	1
used	1
in	1
port.	1
It	1
was	1
of	1
a	1
conical	1
shape,	1
some	1
ten	1
feet	1
high;	1
consisting	1
of	1
the	1
long,	1
huge	1
slabs	1
of	1
limber	1
black	1
bone	1
taken	1
from	1
the	1
middle	1
and	1
highest	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
jaws	1
of	1
the	1
right-whale.	1
Planted	1
with	1
their	1
broad	1
ends	1
on	1
the	1
deck,	1
a	1
circle	1
of	1
these	1
slabs	1
laced	1
together,	1
mutually	1
sloped	1
towards	1
each	1
other,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
apex	1
united	1
in	1
a	1
tufted	1
point,	1
where	1
the	1
loose	1
hairy	1
fibres	1
waved	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
like	1
the	1
top-knot	1
on	1
some	1
old	1
Pottowottamie	1
Sachem's	1
head.	1
A	1
triangular	1
opening	1
faced	1
towards	1
the	1
bows	1
of	1
the	1
ship,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
insider	1
commanded	1
a	1
complete	1
view	1
forward.	1
And	1
half	1
concealed	1
in	1
this	1
queer	1
tenement,	1
I	1
at	1
length	1
found	1
one	1
who	1
by	1
his	1
aspect	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
authority;	1
and	1
who,	1
it	1
being	1
noon,	1
and	1
the	1
ship's	1
work	1
suspended,	1
was	1
now	1
enjoying	1
respite	1
from	1
the	1
burden	1
of	1
command.	1
He	1
was	1
seated	1
on	1
an	1
old-fashioned	1
oaken	1
chair,	1
wriggling	1
all	1
over	1
with	1
curious	1
carving;	1
and	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
which	1
was	1
formed	1
of	1
a	1
stout	1
interlacing	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
elastic	1
stuff	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
wigwam	1
was	1
constructed.	1
There	1
was	1
nothing	1
so	1
very	1
particular,	1
perhaps,	1
about	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
the	1
elderly	1
man	1
I	1
saw;	1
he	1
was	1
brown	1
and	1
brawny,	1
like	1
most	1
old	1
seamen,	1
and	1
heavily	1
rolled	1
up	1
in	1
blue	1
pilot-cloth,	1
cut	1
in	1
the	1
Quaker	1
style;	1
only	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
fine	1
and	1
almost	1
microscopic	1
net-work	1
of	1
the	1
minutest	1
wrinkles	1
interlacing	1
round	1
his	1
eyes,	1
which	1
must	1
have	1
arisen	1
from	1
his	1
continual	1
sailings	1
in	1
many	1
hard	1
gales,	1
and	1
always	1
looking	1
to	1
windward;--for	1
this	1
causes	1
the	1
muscles	1
about	1
the	1
eyes	1
to	1
become	1
pursed	1
together.	1
Such	1
eye-wrinkles	1
are	1
very	1
effectual	1
in	1
a	1
scowl.	1
"Is	1
this	1
the	1
Captain	1
of	1
the	1
Pequod?"	1
said	1
I,	1
advancing	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
tent.	1
"Supposing	1
it	1
be	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
Pequod,	1
what	1
dost	1
thou	1
want	1
of	1
him?"	1
he	1
demanded.	1
"I	1
was	1
thinking	1
of	1
shipping."	1
"Thou	1
wast,	1
wast	1
thou?	1
I	1
see	1
thou	1
art	1
no	1
Nantucketer--ever	1
been	1
in	1
a	1
stove	1
boat?"	1
"No,	1
Sir,	1
I	1
never	1
have."	1
"Dost	1
know	1
nothing	1
at	1
all	1
about	1
whaling,	1
I	1
dare	1
say--eh?	1
"Nothing,	1
Sir;	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
doubt	1
I	1
shall	1
soon	1
learn.	1
I've	1
been	1
several	1
voyages	1
in	1
the	1
merchant	1
service,	1
and	1
I	1
think	1
that--"	1
"Merchant	1
service	1
be	1
damned.	1
Talk	1
not	1
that	1
lingo	1
to	1
me.	1
Dost	1
see	1
that	1
leg?--I'll	1
take	1
that	1
leg	1
away	1
from	1
thy	1
stern,	1
if	1
ever	1
thou	1
talkest	1
of	1
the	1
marchant	1
service	1
to	1
me	1
again.	1
Marchant	1
service	1
indeed!	1
I	1
suppose	1
now	1
ye	1
feel	1
considerable	1
proud	1
of	1
having	1
served	1
in	1
those	1
marchant	1
ships.	1
But	1
flukes!	1
man,	1
what	1
makes	1
thee	1
want	1
to	1
go	1
a	1
whaling,	1
eh?--it	1
looks	1
a	1
little	1
suspicious,	1
don't	1
it,	1
eh?--Hast	1
not	1
been	1
a	1
pirate,	1
hast	1
thou?--Didst	1
not	1
rob	1
thy	1
last	1
Captain,	1
didst	1
thou?--Dost	1
not	1
think	1
of	1
murdering	1
the	1
officers	1
when	1
thou	1
gettest	1
to	1
sea?"	1
I	1
protested	1
my	1
innocence	1
of	1
these	1
things.	1
I	1
saw	1
that	1
under	1
the	1
mask	1
of	1
these	1
half	1
humorous	1
innuendoes,	1
this	1
old	1
seaman,	1
as	1
an	1
insulated	1
Quakerish	1
Nantucketer,	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
his	1
insular	1
prejudices,	1
and	1
rather	1
distrustful	1
of	1
all	1
aliens,	1
unless	1
they	1
hailed	1
from	1
Cape	1
Cod	1
or	1
the	1
Vineyard.	1
"But	1
what	1
takes	1
thee	1
a-whaling?	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
know	1
that	1
before	1
I	1
think	1
of	1
shipping	1
ye."	1
"Well,	1
sir,	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
whaling	1
is.	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
world."	1
"Want	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
whaling	1
is,	1
eh?	1
Have	1
ye	1
clapped	1
eye	1
on	1
Captain	1
Ahab?"	1
"Who	1
is	1
Captain	1
Ahab,	1
sir?"	1
"Aye,	1
aye,	1
I	1
thought	1
so.	1
Captain	1
Ahab	1
is	1
the	1
Captain	1
of	1
this	1
ship."	1
"I	1
am	1
mistaken	1
then.	1
I	1
thought	1
I	1
was	1
speaking	1
to	1
the	1
Captain	1
himself."	1
"Thou	1
art	1
speaking	1
to	1
Captain	1
Peleg--that's	1
who	1
ye	1
are	1
speaking	1
to,	1
young	1
man.	1
It	1
belongs	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
Captain	1
Bildad	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
Pequod	1
fitted	1
out	1
for	1
the	1
voyage,	1
and	1
supplied	1
with	1
all	1
her	1
needs,	1
including	1
crew.	1
We	1
are	1
part	1
owners	1
and	1
agents.	1
But	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
say,	1
if	1
thou	1
wantest	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
whaling	1
is,	1
as	1
thou	1
tellest	1
ye	1
do,	1
I	1
can	1
put	1
ye	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
of	1
finding	1
it	1
out	1
before	1
ye	1
bind	1
yourself	1
to	1
it,	1
past	1
backing	1
out.	1
Clap	1
eye	1
on	1
Captain	1
Ahab,	1
young	1
man,	1
and	1
thou	1
wilt	1
find	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
only	1
one	1
leg."	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
mean,	1
sir?	1
Was	1
the	1
other	1
one	1
lost	1
by	1
a	1
whale?"	1
"Lost	1
by	1
a	1
whale!	1
Young	1
man,	1
come	1
nearer	1
to	1
me:	1
it	1
was	1
devoured,	1
chewed	1
up,	1
crunched	1
by	1
the	1
monstrousest	1
parmacetty	1
that	1
ever	1
chipped	1
a	1
boat!--ah,	1
ah!"	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
alarmed	1
by	1
his	1
energy,	1
perhaps	1
also	1
a	1
little	1
touched	1
at	1
the	1
hearty	1
grief	1
in	1
his	1
concluding	1
exclamation,	1
but	1
said	1
as	1
calmly	1
as	1
I	1
could,	1
"What	1
you	1
say	1
is	1
no	1
doubt	1
true	1
enough,	1
sir;	1
but	1
how	1
could	1
I	1
know	1
there	1
was	1
any	1
peculiar	1
ferocity	1
in	1
that	1
particular	1
whale,	1
though	1
indeed	1
I	1
might	1
have	1
inferred	1
as	1
much	1
from	1
the	1
simple	1
fact	1
of	1
the	1
accident."	1
"Look	1
ye	1
now,	1
young	1
man,	1
thy	1
lungs	1
are	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
soft,	1
d'ye	1
see;	1
thou	1
dost	1
not	1
talk	1
shark	1
a	1
bit.	1
SURE,	1
ye've	1
been	1
to	1
sea	1
before	1
now;	1
sure	1
of	1
that?"	1
"Sir,"	1
said	1
I,	1
"I	1
thought	1
I	1
told	1
you	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
been	1
four	1
voyages	1
in	1
the	1
merchant--"	1
"Hard	1
down	1
out	1
of	1
that!	1
Mind	1
what	1
I	1
said	1
about	1
the	1
marchant	1
service--don't	1
aggravate	1
me--I	1
won't	1
have	1
it.	1
But	1
let	1
us	1
understand	1
each	1
other.	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
thee	1
a	1
hint	1
about	1
what	1
whaling	1
is;	1
do	1
ye	1
yet	1
feel	1
inclined	1
for	1
it?"	1
"I	1
do,	1
sir."	1
"Very	1
good.	1
Now,	1
art	1
thou	1
the	1
man	1
to	1
pitch	1
a	1
harpoon	1
down	1
a	1
live	1
whale's	1
throat,	1
and	1
then	1
jump	1
after	1
it?	1
Answer,	1
quick!"	1
"I	1
am,	1
sir,	1
if	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
positively	1
indispensable	1
to	1
do	1
so;	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
got	1
rid	1
of,	1
that	1
is;	1
which	1
I	1
don't	1
take	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
fact."	1
"Good	1
again.	1
Now	1
then,	1
thou	1
not	1
only	1
wantest	1
to	1
go	1
a-whaling,	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
by	1
experience	1
what	1
whaling	1
is,	1
but	1
ye	1
also	1
want	1
to	1
go	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
world?	1
Was	1
not	1
that	1
what	1
ye	1
said?	1
I	1
thought	1
so.	1
Well	1
then,	1
just	1
step	1
forward	1
there,	1
and	1
take	1
a	1
peep	1
over	1
the	1
weather-bow,	1
and	1
then	1
back	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
tell	1
me	1
what	1
ye	1
see	1
there."	1
For	1
a	1
moment	1
I	1
stood	1
a	1
little	1
puzzled	1
by	1
this	1
curious	1
request,	1
not	1
knowing	1
exactly	1
how	1
to	1
take	1
it,	1
whether	1
humorously	1
or	1
in	1
earnest.	1
But	1
concentrating	1
all	1
his	1
crow's	1
feet	1
into	1
one	1
scowl,	1
Captain	1
Peleg	1
started	1
me	1
on	1
the	1
errand.	1
Going	1
forward	1
and	1
glancing	1
over	1
the	1
weather	1
bow,	1
I	1
perceived	1
that	1
the	1
ship	1
swinging	1
to	1
her	1
anchor	1
with	1
the	1
flood-tide,	1
was	1
now	1
obliquely	1
pointing	1
towards	1
the	1
open	1
ocean.	1
The	1
prospect	1
was	1
unlimited,	1
but	1
exceedingly	1
monotonous	1
and	1
forbidding;	1
not	1
the	1
slightest	1
variety	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
see.	1
"Well,	1
what's	1
the	1
report?"	1
said	1
Peleg	1
when	1
I	1
came	1
back;	1
"what	1
did	1
ye	1
see?"	1
"Not	1
much,"	1
I	1
replied--"nothing	1
but	1
water;	1
considerable	1
horizon	1
though,	1
and	1
there's	1
a	1
squall	1
coming	1
up,	1
I	1
think."	1
"Well,	1
what	1
does	1
thou	1
think	1
then	1
of	1
seeing	1
the	1
world?	1
Do	1
ye	1
wish	1
to	1
go	1
round	1
Cape	1
Horn	1
to	1
see	1
any	1
more	1
of	1
it,	1
eh?	1
Can't	1
ye	1
see	1
the	1
world	1
where	1
you	1
stand?"	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
staggered,	1
but	1
go	1
a-whaling	1
I	1
must,	1
and	1
I	1
would;	1
and	1
the	1
Pequod	1
was	1
as	1
good	1
a	1
ship	1
as	1
any--I	1
thought	1
the	1
best--and	1
all	1
this	1
I	1
now	1
repeated	1
to	1
Peleg.	1
Seeing	1
me	1
so	1
determined,	1
he	1
expressed	1
his	1
willingness	1
to	1
ship	1
me.	1
"And	1
thou	1
mayest	1
as	1
well	1
sign	1
the	1
papers	1
right	1
off,"	1
he	1
added--"come	1
along	1
with	1
ye."	1
And	1
so	1
saying,	1
he	1
led	1
the	1
way	1
below	1
deck	1
into	1
the	1
cabin.	1
Seated	1
on	1
the	1
transom	1
was	1
what	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
a	1
most	1
uncommon	1
and	1
surprising	1
figure.	1
It	1
turned	1
out	1
to	1
be	1
Captain	1
Bildad,	1
who	1
along	1
with	1
Captain	1
Peleg	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
largest	1
owners	1
of	1
the	1
vessel;	1
the	1
other	1
shares,	1
as	1
is	1
sometimes	1
the	1
case	1
in	1
these	1
ports,	1
being	1
held	1
by	1
a	1
crowd	1
of	1
old	1
annuitants;	1
widows,	1
fatherless	1
children,	1
and	1
chancery	1
wards;	1
each	1
owning	1
about	1
the	1
value	1
of	1
a	1
timber	1
head,	1
or	1
a	1
foot	1
of	1
plank,	1
or	1
a	1
nail	1
or	1
two	1
in	1
the	1
ship.	1
People	1
in	1
Nantucket	1
invest	1
their	1
money	1
in	1
whaling	1
vessels,	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
that	1
you	1
do	1
yours	1
in	1
approved	1
state	1
stocks	1
bringing	1
in	1
good	1
interest.	1
Now,	1
Bildad,	1
like	1
Peleg,	1
and	1
indeed	1
many	1
other	1
Nantucketers,	1
was	1
a	1
Quaker,	1
the	1
island	1
having	1
been	1
originally	1
settled	1
by	1
that	1
sect;	1
and	1
to	1
this	1
day	1
its	1
inhabitants	1
in	1
general	1
retain	1
in	1
an	1
uncommon	1
measure	1
the	1
peculiarities	1
of	1
the	1
Quaker,	1
only	1
variously	1
and	1
anomalously	1
modified	1
by	1
things	1
altogether	1
alien	1
and	1
heterogeneous.	1
For	1
some	1
of	1
these	1
same	1
Quakers	1
are	1
the	1
most	1
sanguinary	1
of	1
all	1
sailors	1
and	1
whale-hunters.	1
They	1
are	1
fighting	1
Quakers;	1
they	1
are	1
Quakers	1
with	1
a	1
vengeance.	1
So	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
instances	1
among	1
them	1
of	1
men,	1
who,	1
named	1
with	1
Scripture	1
names--a	1
singularly	1
common	1
fashion	1
on	1
the	1
island--and	1
in	1
childhood	1
naturally	1
imbibing	1
the	1
stately	1
dramatic	1
thee	1
and	1
thou	1
of	1
the	1
Quaker	1
idiom;	1
still,	1
from	1
the	1
audacious,	1
daring,	1
and	1
boundless	1
adventure	1
of	1
their	1
subsequent	1
lives,	1
strangely	1
blend	1
with	1
these	1
unoutgrown	1
peculiarities,	1
a	1
thousand	1
bold	1
dashes	1
of	1
character,	1
not	1
unworthy	1
a	1
Scandinavian	1
sea-king,	1
or	1
a	1
poetical	1
Pagan	1
Roman.	1
And	1
when	1
these	1
things	1
unite	1
in	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
greatly	1
superior	1
natural	1
force,	1
with	1
a	1
globular	1
brain	1
and	1
a	1
ponderous	1
heart;	1
who	1
has	1
also	1
by	1
the	1
stillness	1
and	1
seclusion	1
of	1
many	1
long	1
night-watches	1
in	1
the	1
remotest	1
waters,	1
and	1
beneath	1
constellations	1
never	1
seen	1
here	1
at	1
the	1
north,	1
been	1
led	1
to	1
think	1
untraditionally	1
and	1
independently;	1
receiving	1
all	1
nature's	1
sweet	1
or	1
savage	1
impressions	1
fresh	1
from	1
her	1
own	1
virgin	1
voluntary	1
and	1
confiding	1
breast,	1
and	1
thereby	1
chiefly,	1
but	1
with	1
some	1
help	1
from	1
accidental	1
advantages,	1
to	1
learn	1
a	1
bold	1
and	1
nervous	1
lofty	1
language--that	1
man	1
makes	1
one	1
in	1
a	1
whole	1
nation's	1
census--a	1
mighty	1
pageant	1
creature,	1
formed	1
for	1
noble	1
tragedies.	1
Nor	1
will	1
it	1
at	1
all	1
detract	1
from	1
him,	1
dramatically	1
regarded,	1
if	1
either	1
by	1
birth	1
or	1
other	1
circumstances,	1
he	1
have	1
what	1
seems	1
a	1
half	1
wilful	1
overruling	1
morbidness	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
his	1
nature.	1
For	1
all	1
men	1
tragically	1
great	1
are	1
made	1
so	1
through	1
a	1
certain	1
morbidness.	1
Be	1
sure	1
of	1
this,	1
O	1
young	1
ambition,	1
all	1
mortal	1
greatness	1
is	1
but	1
disease.	1
But,	1
as	1
yet	1
we	1
have	1
not	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
such	1
an	1
one,	1
but	1
with	1
quite	1
another;	1
and	1
still	1
a	1
man,	1
who,	1
if	1
indeed	1
peculiar,	1
it	1
only	1
results	1
again	1
from	1
another	1
phase	1
of	1
the	1
Quaker,	1
modified	1
by	1
individual	1
circumstances.	1
Like	1
Captain	1
Peleg,	1
Captain	1
Bildad	1
was	1
a	1
well-to-do,	1
retired	1
whaleman.	1
But	1
unlike	1
Captain	1
Peleg--who	1
cared	1
not	1
a	1
rush	1
for	1
what	1
are	1
called	1
serious	1
things,	1
and	1
indeed	1
deemed	1
those	1
self-same	1
serious	1
things	1
the	1
veriest	1
of	1
all	1
trifles--Captain	1
Bildad	1
had	1
not	1
only	1
been	1
originally	1
educated	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
strictest	1
sect	1
of	1
Nantucket	1
Quakerism,	1
but	1
all	1
his	1
subsequent	1
ocean	1
life,	1
and	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
many	1
unclad,	1
lovely	1
island	1
creatures,	1
round	1
the	1
Horn--all	1
that	1
had	1
not	1
moved	1
this	1
native	1
born	1
Quaker	1
one	1
single	1
jot,	1
had	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
altered	1
one	1
angle	1
of	1
his	1
vest.	1
Still,	1
for	1
all	1
this	1
immutableness,	1
was	1
there	1
some	1
lack	1
of	1
common	1
consistency	1
about	1
worthy	1
Captain	1
Peleg.	1
Though	1
refusing,	1
from	1
conscientious	1
scruples,	1
to	1
bear	1
arms	1
against	1
land	1
invaders,	1
yet	1
himself	1
had	1
illimitably	1
invaded	1
the	1
Atlantic	1
and	1
Pacific;	1
and	1
though	1
a	1
sworn	1
foe	1
to	1
human	1
bloodshed,	1
yet	1
had	1
he	1
in	1
his	1
straight-bodied	1
coat,	1
spilled	1
tuns	1
upon	1
tuns	1
of	1
leviathan	1
gore.	1
How	1
now	1
in	1
the	1
contemplative	1
evening	1
of	1
his	1
days,	1
the	1
pious	1
Bildad	1
reconciled	1
these	1
things	1
in	1
the	1
reminiscence,	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know;	1
but	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
concern	1
him	1
much,	1
and	1
very	1
probably	1
he	1
had	1
long	1
since	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
sage	1
and	1
sensible	1
conclusion	1
that	1
a	1
man's	1
religion	1
is	1
one	1
thing,	1
and	1
this	1
practical	1
world	1
quite	1
another.	1
This	1
world	1
pays	1
dividends.	1
Rising	1
from	1
a	1
little	1
cabin-boy	1
in	1
short	1
clothes	1
of	1
the	1
drabbest	1
drab,	1
to	1
a	1
harpooneer	1
in	1
a	1
broad	1
shad-bellied	1
waistcoat;	1
from	1
that	1
becoming	1
boat-header,	1
chief-mate,	1
and	1
captain,	1
and	1
finally	1
a	1
ship	1
owner;	1
Bildad,	1
as	1
I	1
hinted	1
before,	1
had	1
concluded	1
his	1
adventurous	1
career	1
by	1
wholly	1
retiring	1
from	1
active	1
life	1
at	1
the	1
goodly	1
age	1
of	1
sixty,	1
and	1
dedicating	1
his	1
remaining	1
days	1
to	1
the	1
quiet	1
receiving	1
of	1
his	1
well-earned	1
income.	1
Now,	1
Bildad,	1
I	1
am	1
sorry	1
to	1
say,	1
had	1
the	1
reputation	1
of	1
being	1
an	1
incorrigible	1
old	1
hunks,	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
sea-going	1
days,	1
a	1
bitter,	1
hard	1
task-master.	1
They	1
told	1
me	1
in	1
Nantucket,	1
though	1
it	1
certainly	1
seems	1
a	1
curious	1
story,	1
that	1
when	1
he	1
sailed	1
the	1
old	1
Categut	1
whaleman,	1
his	1
crew,	1
upon	1
arriving	1
home,	1
were	1
mostly	1
all	1
carried	1
ashore	1
to	1
the	1
hospital,	1
sore	1
exhausted	1
and	1
worn	1
out.	1
For	1
a	1
pious	1
man,	1
especially	1
for	1
a	1
Quaker,	1
he	1
was	1
certainly	1
rather	1
hard-hearted,	1
to	1
say	1
the	1
least.	1
He	1
never	1
used	1
to	1
swear,	1
though,	1
at	1
his	1
men,	1
they	1
said;	1
but	1
somehow	1
he	1
got	1
an	1
inordinate	1
quantity	1
of	1
cruel,	1
unmitigated	1
hard	1
work	1
out	1
of	1
them.	1
When	1
Bildad	1
was	1
a	1
chief-mate,	1
to	1
have	1
his	1
drab-coloured	1
eye	1
intently	1
looking	1
at	1
you,	1
made	1
you	1
feel	1
completely	1
nervous,	1
till	1
you	1
could	1
clutch	1
something--a	1
hammer	1
or	1
a	1
marling-spike,	1
and	1
go	1
to	1
work	1
like	1
mad,	1
at	1
something	1
or	1
other,	1
never	1
mind	1
what.	1
Indolence	1
and	1
idleness	1
perished	1
before	1
him.	1
His	1
own	1
person	1
was	1
the	1
exact	1
embodiment	1
of	1
his	1
utilitarian	1
character.	1
On	1
his	1
long,	1
gaunt	1
body,	1
he	1
carried	1
no	1
spare	1
flesh,	1
no	1
superfluous	1
beard,	1
his	1
chin	1
having	1
a	1
soft,	1
economical	1
nap	1
to	1
it,	1
like	1
the	1
worn	1
nap	1
of	1
his	1
broad-brimmed	1
hat.	1
Such,	1
then,	1
was	1
the	1
person	1
that	1
I	1
saw	1
seated	1
on	1
the	1
transom	1
when	1
I	1
followed	1
Captain	1
Peleg	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
cabin.	1
The	1
space	1
between	1
the	1
decks	1
was	1
small;	1
and	1
there,	1
bolt-upright,	1
sat	1
old	1
Bildad,	1
who	1
always	1
sat	1
so,	1
and	1
never	1
leaned,	1
and	1
this	1
to	1
save	1
his	1
coat	1
tails.	1
His	1
broad-brim	1
was	1
placed	1
beside	1
him;	1
his	1
legs	1
were	1
stiffly	1
crossed;	1
his	1
drab	1
vesture	1
was	1
buttoned	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
chin;	1
and	1
spectacles	1
on	1
nose,	1
he	1
seemed	1
absorbed	1
in	1
reading	1
from	1
a	1
ponderous	1
volume.	1
"Bildad,"	1
cried	1
Captain	1
Peleg,	1
"at	1
it	1
again,	1
Bildad,	1
eh?	1
Ye	1
have	1
been	1
studying	1
those	1
Scriptures,	1
now,	1
for	1
the	1
last	1
thirty	1
years,	1
to	1
my	1
certain	1
knowledge.	1
How	1
far	1
ye	1
got,	1
Bildad?"	1
As	1
if	1
long	1
habituated	1
to	1
such	1
profane	1
talk	1
from	1
his	1
old	1
shipmate,	1
Bildad,	1
without	1
noticing	1
his	1
present	1
irreverence,	1
quietly	1
looked	1
up,	1
and	1
seeing	1
me,	1
glanced	1
again	1
inquiringly	1
towards	1
Peleg.	1
"He	1
says	1
he's	1
our	1
man,	1
Bildad,"	1
said	1
Peleg,	1
"he	1
wants	1
to	1
ship."	1
"Dost	1
thee?"	1
said	1
Bildad,	1
in	1
a	1
hollow	1
tone,	1
and	1
turning	1
round	1
to	1
me.	1
"I	1
dost,"	1
said	1
I	1
unconsciously,	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
intense	1
a	1
Quaker.	1
"What	1
do	1
ye	1
think	1
of	1
him,	1
Bildad?"	1
said	1
Peleg.	1
"He'll	1
do,"	1
said	1
Bildad,	1
eyeing	1
me,	1
and	1
then	1
went	1
on	1
spelling	1
away	1
at	1
his	1
book	1
in	1
a	1
mumbling	1
tone	1
quite	1
audible.	1
I	1
thought	1
him	1
the	1
queerest	1
old	1
Quaker	1
I	1
ever	1
saw,	1
especially	1
as	1
Peleg,	1
his	1
friend	1
and	1
old	1
shipmate,	1
seemed	1
such	1
a	1
blusterer.	1
But	1
I	1
said	1
nothing,	1
only	1
looking	1
round	1
me	1
sharply.	1
Peleg	1
now	1
threw	1
open	1
a	1
chest,	1
and	1
drawing	1
forth	1
the	1
ship's	1
articles,	1
placed	1
pen	1
and	1
ink	1
before	1
him,	1
and	1
seated	1
himself	1
at	1
a	1
little	1
table.	1
I	1
began	1
to	1
think	1
it	1
was	1
high	1
time	1
to	1
settle	1
with	1
myself	1
at	1
what	1
terms	1
I	1
would	1
be	1
willing	1
to	1
engage	1
for	1
the	1
voyage.	1
I	1
was	1
already	1
aware	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
whaling	1
business	1
they	1
paid	1
no	1
wages;	1
but	1
all	1
hands,	1
including	1
the	1
captain,	1
received	1
certain	1
shares	1
of	1
the	1
profits	1
called	1
lays,	1
and	1
that	1
these	1
lays	1
were	1
proportioned	1
to	1
the	1
degree	1
of	1
importance	1
pertaining	1
to	1
the	1
respective	1
duties	1
of	1
the	1
ship's	1
company.	1
I	1
was	1
also	1
aware	1
that	1
being	1
a	1
green	1
hand	1
at	1
whaling,	1
my	1
own	1
lay	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
very	1
large;	1
but	1
considering	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
used	1
to	1
the	1
sea,	1
could	1
steer	1
a	1
ship,	1
splice	1
a	1
rope,	1
and	1
all	1
that,	1
I	1
made	1
no	1
doubt	1
that	1
from	1
all	1
I	1
had	1
heard	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
offered	1
at	1
least	1
the	1
275th	1
lay--that	1
is,	1
the	1
275th	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
clear	1
net	1
proceeds	1
of	1
the	1
voyage,	1
whatever	1
that	1
might	1
eventually	1
amount	1
to.	1
And	1
though	1
the	1
275th	1
lay	1
was	1
what	1
they	1
call	1
a	1
rather	1
LONG	1
LAY,	1
yet	1
it	1
was	1
better	1
than	1
nothing;	1
and	1
if	1
we	1
had	1
a	1
lucky	1
voyage,	1
might	1
pretty	1
nearly	1
pay	1
for	1
the	1
clothing	1
I	1
would	1
wear	1
out	1
on	1
it,	1
not	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
my	1
three	1
years'	1
beef	1
and	1
board,	1
for	1
which	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
to	1
pay	1
one	1
stiver.	1
It	1
might	1
be	1
thought	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
a	1
poor	1
way	1
to	1
accumulate	1
a	1
princely	1
fortune--and	1
so	1
it	1
was,	1
a	1
very	1
poor	1
way	1
indeed.	1
But	1
I	1
am	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
never	1
take	1
on	1
about	1
princely	1
fortunes,	1
and	1
am	1
quite	1
content	1
if	1
the	1
world	1
is	1
ready	1
to	1
board	1
and	1
lodge	1
me,	1
while	1
I	1
am	1
putting	1
up	1
at	1
this	1
grim	1
sign	1
of	1
the	1
Thunder	1
Cloud.	1
Upon	1
the	1
whole,	1
I	1
thought	1
that	1
the	1
275th	1
lay	1
would	1
be	1
about	1
the	1
fair	1
thing,	1
but	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
surprised	1
had	1
I	1
been	1
offered	1
the	1
200th,	1
considering	1
I	1
was	1
of	1
a	1
broad-shouldered	1
make.	1
But	1
one	1
thing,	1
nevertheless,	1
that	1
made	1
me	1
a	1
little	1
distrustful	1
about	1
receiving	1
a	1
generous	1
share	1
of	1
the	1
profits	1
was	1
this:	1
Ashore,	1
I	1
had	1
heard	1
something	1
of	1
both	1
Captain	1
Peleg	1
and	1
his	1
unaccountable	1
old	1
crony	1
Bildad;	1
how	1
that	1
they	1
being	1
the	1
principal	1
proprietors	1
of	1
the	1
Pequod,	1
therefore	1
the	1
other	1
and	1
more	1
inconsiderable	1
and	1
scattered	1
owners,	1
left	1
nearly	1
the	1
whole	1
management	1
of	1
the	1
ship's	1
affairs	1
to	1
these	1
two.	1
And	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
but	1
what	1
the	1
stingy	1
old	1
Bildad	1
might	1
have	1
a	1
mighty	1
deal	1
to	1
say	1
about	1
shipping	1
hands,	1
especially	1
as	1
I	1
now	1
found	1
him	1
on	1
board	1
the	1
Pequod,	1
quite	1
at	1
home	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
cabin,	1
and	1
reading	1
his	1
Bible	1
as	1
if	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
fireside.	1
Now	1
while	1
Peleg	1
was	1
vainly	1
trying	1
to	1
mend	1
a	1
pen	1
with	1
his	1
jack-knife,	1
old	1
Bildad,	1
to	1
my	1
no	1
small	1
surprise,	1
considering	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
such	1
an	1
interested	1
party	1
in	1
these	1
proceedings;	1
Bildad	1
never	1
heeded	1
us,	1
but	1
went	1
on	1
mumbling	1
to	1
himself	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
book,	1
"LAY	1
not	1
up	1
for	1
yourselves	1
treasures	1
upon	1
earth,	1
where	1
moth--"	1
"Well,	1
Captain	1
Bildad,"	1
interrupted	1
Peleg,	1
"what	1
d'ye	1
say,	1
what	1
lay	1
shall	1
we	1
give	1
this	1
young	1
man?"	1
"Thou	1
knowest	1
best,"	1
was	1
the	1
sepulchral	1
reply,	1
"the	1
seven	1
hundred	1
and	1
seventy-seventh	1
wouldn't	1
be	1
too	1
much,	1
would	1
it?--'where	1
moth	1
and	1
rust	1
do	1
corrupt,	1
but	1
LAY--'"	1
LAY,	1
indeed,	1
thought	1
I,	1
and	1
such	1
a	1
lay!	1
the	1
seven	1
hundred	1
and	1
seventy-seventh!	1
Well,	1
old	1
Bildad,	1
you	1
are	1
determined	1
that	1
I,	1
for	1
one,	1
shall	1
not	1
LAY	1
up	1
many	1
LAYS	1
here	1
below,	1
where	1
moth	1
and	1
rust	1
do	1
corrupt.	1
It	1
was	1
an	1
exceedingly	1
LONG	1
LAY	1
that,	1
indeed;	1
and	1
though	1
from	1
the	1
magnitude	1
of	1
the	1
figure	1
it	1
might	1
at	1
first	1
deceive	1
a	1
landsman,	1
yet	1
the	1
slightest	1
consideration	1
will	1
show	1
that	1
though	1
seven	1
hundred	1
and	1
seventy-seven	1
is	1
a	1
pretty	1
large	1
number,	1
yet,	1
when	1
you	1
come	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
TEENTH	1
of	1
it,	1
you	1
will	1
then	1
see,	1
I	1
say,	1
that	1
the	1
seven	1
hundred	1
and	1
seventy-seventh	1
part	1
of	1
a	1
farthing	1
is	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
less	1
than	1
seven	1
hundred	1
and	1
seventy-seven	1
gold	1
doubloons;	1
and	1
so	1
I	1
thought	1
at	1
the	1
time.	1
"Why,	1
blast	1
your	1
eyes,	1
Bildad,"	1
cried	1
Peleg,	1
"thou	1
dost	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
swindle	1
this	1
young	1
man!	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
more	1
than	1
that."	1
"Seven	1
hundred	1
and	1
seventy-seventh,"	1
again	1
said	1
Bildad,	1
without	1
lifting	1
his	1
eyes;	1
and	1
then	1
went	1
on	1
mumbling--"for	1
where	1
your	1
treasure	1
is,	1
there	1
will	1
your	1
heart	1
be	1
also."	1
"I	1
am	1
going	1
to	1
put	1
him	1
down	1
for	1
the	1
three	1
hundredth,"	1
said	1
Peleg,	1
"do	1
ye	1
hear	1
that,	1
Bildad!	1
The	1
three	1
hundredth	1
lay,	1
I	1
say."	1
Bildad	1
laid	1
down	1
his	1
book,	1
and	1
turning	1
solemnly	1
towards	1
him	1
said,	1
"Captain	1
Peleg,	1
thou	1
hast	1
a	1
generous	1
heart;	1
but	1
thou	1
must	1
consider	1
the	1
duty	1
thou	1
owest	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
owners	1
of	1
this	1
ship--widows	1
and	1
orphans,	1
many	1
of	1
them--and	1
that	1
if	1
we	1
too	1
abundantly	1
reward	1
the	1
labors	1
of	1
this	1
young	1
man,	1
we	1
may	1
be	1
taking	1
the	1
bread	1
from	1
those	1
widows	1
and	1
those	1
orphans.	1
The	1
seven	1
hundred	1
and	1
seventy-seventh	1
lay,	1
Captain	1
Peleg."	1
"Thou	1
Bildad!"	1
roared	1
Peleg,	1
starting	1
up	1
and	1
clattering	1
about	1
the	1
cabin.	1
"Blast	1
ye,	1
Captain	1
Bildad,	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
followed	1
thy	1
advice	1
in	1
these	1
matters,	1
I	1
would	1
afore	1
now	1
had	1
a	1
conscience	1
to	1
lug	1
about	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
heavy	1
enough	1
to	1
founder	1
the	1
largest	1
ship	1
that	1
ever	1
sailed	1
round	1
Cape	1
Horn."	1
"Captain	1
Peleg,"	1
said	1
Bildad	1
steadily,	1
"thy	1
conscience	1
may	1
be	1
drawing	1
ten	1
inches	1
of	1
water,	1
or	1
ten	1
fathoms,	1
I	1
can't	1
tell;	1
but	1
as	1
thou	1
art	1
still	1
an	1
impenitent	1
man,	1
Captain	1
Peleg,	1
I	1
greatly	1
fear	1
lest	1
thy	1
conscience	1
be	1
but	1
a	1
leaky	1
one;	1
and	1
will	1
in	1
the	1
end	1
sink	1
thee	1
foundering	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
fiery	1
pit,	1
Captain	1
Peleg."	1
"Fiery	1
pit!	1
fiery	1
pit!	1
ye	1
insult	1
me,	1
man;	1
past	1
all	1
natural	1
bearing,	1
ye	1
insult	1
me.	1
It's	1
an	1
all-fired	1
outrage	1
to	1
tell	1
any	1
human	1
creature	1
that	1
he's	1
bound	1
to	1
hell.	1
Flukes	1
and	1
flames!	1
Bildad,	1
say	1
that	1
again	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
start	1
my	1
soul-bolts,	1
but	1
I'll--I'll--yes,	1
I'll	1
swallow	1
a	1
live	1
goat	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
hair	1
and	1
horns	1
on.	1
Out	1
of	1
the	1
cabin,	1
ye	1
canting,	1
drab-coloured	1
son	1
of	1
a	1
wooden	1
gun--a	1
straight	1
wake	1
with	1
ye!"	1
As	1
he	1
thundered	1
out	1
this	1
he	1
made	1
a	1
rush	1
at	1
Bildad,	1
but	1
with	1
a	1
marvellous	1
oblique,	1
sliding	1
celerity,	1
Bildad	1
for	1
that	1
time	1
eluded	1
him.	1
Alarmed	1
at	1
this	1
terrible	1
outburst	1
between	1
the	1
two	1
principal	1
and	1
responsible	1
owners	1
of	1
the	1
ship,	1
and	1
feeling	1
half	1
a	1
mind	1
to	1
give	1
up	1
all	1
idea	1
of	1
sailing	1
in	1
a	1
vessel	1
so	1
questionably	1
owned	1
and	1
temporarily	1
commanded,	1
I	1
stepped	1
aside	1
from	1
the	1
door	1
to	1
give	1
egress	1
to	1
Bildad,	1
who,	1
I	1
made	1
no	1
doubt,	1
was	1
all	1
eagerness	1
to	1
vanish	1
from	1
before	1
the	1
awakened	1
wrath	1
of	1
Peleg.	1
But	1
to	1
my	1
astonishment,	1
he	1
sat	1
down	1
again	1
on	1
the	1
transom	1
very	1
quietly,	1
and	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
not	1
the	1
slightest	1
intention	1
of	1
withdrawing.	1
He	1
seemed	1
quite	1
used	1
to	1
impenitent	1
Peleg	1
and	1
his	1
ways.	1
As	1
for	1
Peleg,	1
after	1
letting	1
off	1
his	1
rage	1
as	1
he	1
had,	1
there	1
seemed	1
no	1
more	1
left	1
in	1
him,	1
and	1
he,	1
too,	1
sat	1
down	1
like	1
a	1
lamb,	1
though	1
he	1
twitched	1
a	1
little	1
as	1
if	1
still	1
nervously	1
agitated.	1
"Whew!"	1
he	1
whistled	1
at	1
last--"the	1
squall's	1
gone	1
off	1
to	1
leeward,	1
I	1
think.	1
Bildad,	1
thou	1
used	1
to	1
be	1
good	1
at	1
sharpening	1
a	1
lance,	1
mend	1
that	1
pen,	1
will	1
ye.	1
My	1
jack-knife	1
here	1
needs	1
the	1
grindstone.	1
That's	1
he;	1
thank	1
ye,	1
Bildad.	1
Now	1
then,	1
my	1
young	1
man,	1
Ishmael's	1
thy	1
name,	1
didn't	1
ye	1
say?	1
Well	1
then,	1
down	1
ye	1
go	1
here,	1
Ishmael,	1
for	1
the	1
three	1
hundredth	1
lay."	1
"Captain	1
Peleg,"	1
said	1
I,	1
"I	1
have	1
a	1
friend	1
with	1
me	1
who	1
wants	1
to	1
ship	1
too--shall	1
I	1
bring	1
him	1
down	1
to-morrow?"	1
"To	1
be	1
sure,"	1
said	1
Peleg.	1
"Fetch	1
him	1
along,	1
and	1
we'll	1
look	1
at	1
him."	1
"What	1
lay	1
does	1
he	1
want?"	1
groaned	1
Bildad,	1
glancing	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
book	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
again	1
been	1
burying	1
himself.	1
"Oh!	1
never	1
thee	1
mind	1
about	1
that,	1
Bildad,"	1
said	1
Peleg.	1
"Has	1
he	1
ever	1
whaled	1
it	1
any?"	1
turning	1
to	1
me.	1
"Killed	1
more	1
whales	1
than	1
I	1
can	1
count,	1
Captain	1
Peleg."	1
"Well,	1
bring	1
him	1
along	1
then."	1
And,	1
after	1
signing	1
the	1
papers,	1
off	1
I	1
went;	1
nothing	1
doubting	1
but	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
done	1
a	1
good	1
morning's	1
work,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
Pequod	1
was	1
the	1
identical	1
ship	1
that	1
Yojo	1
had	1
provided	1
to	1
carry	1
Queequeg	1
and	1
me	1
round	1
the	1
Cape.	1
But	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
proceeded	1
far,	1
when	1
I	1
began	1
to	1
bethink	1
me	1
that	1
the	1
Captain	1
with	1
whom	1
I	1
was	1
to	1
sail	1
yet	1
remained	1
unseen	1
by	1
me;	1
though,	1
indeed,	1
in	1
many	1
cases,	1
a	1
whale-ship	1
will	1
be	1
completely	1
fitted	1
out,	1
and	1
receive	1
all	1
her	1
crew	1
on	1
board,	1
ere	1
the	1
captain	1
makes	1
himself	1
visible	1
by	1
arriving	1
to	1
take	1
command;	1
for	1
sometimes	1
these	1
voyages	1
are	1
so	1
prolonged,	1
and	1
the	1
shore	1
intervals	1
at	1
home	1
so	1
exceedingly	1
brief,	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
captain	1
have	1
a	1
family,	1
or	1
any	1
absorbing	1
concernment	1
of	1
that	1
sort,	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
trouble	1
himself	1
much	1
about	1
his	1
ship	1
in	1
port,	1
but	1
leaves	1
her	1
to	1
the	1
owners	1
till	1
all	1
is	1
ready	1
for	1
sea.	1
However,	1
it	1
is	1
always	1
as	1
well	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
look	1
at	1
him	1
before	1
irrevocably	1
committing	1
yourself	1
into	1
his	1
hands.	1
Turning	1
back	1
I	1
accosted	1
Captain	1
Peleg,	1
inquiring	1
where	1
Captain	1
Ahab	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
found.	1
"And	1
what	1
dost	1
thou	1
want	1
of	1
Captain	1
Ahab?	1
It's	1
all	1
right	1
enough;	1
thou	1
art	1
shipped."	1
"Yes,	1
but	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
see	1
him."	1
"But	1
I	1
don't	1
think	1
thou	1
wilt	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
at	1
present.	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
exactly	1
what's	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
him;	1
but	1
he	1
keeps	1
close	1
inside	1
the	1
house;	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
sick,	1
and	1
yet	1
he	1
don't	1
look	1
so.	1
In	1
fact,	1
he	1
ain't	1
sick;	1
but	1
no,	1
he	1
isn't	1
well	1
either.	1
Any	1
how,	1
young	1
man,	1
he	1
won't	1
always	1
see	1
me,	1
so	1
I	1
don't	1
suppose	1
he	1
will	1
thee.	1
He's	1
a	1
queer	1
man,	1
Captain	1
Ahab--so	1
some	1
think--but	1
a	1
good	1
one.	1
Oh,	1
thou'lt	1
like	1
him	1
well	1
enough;	1
no	1
fear,	1
no	1
fear.	1
He's	1
a	1
grand,	1
ungodly,	1
god-like	1
man,	1
Captain	1
Ahab;	1
doesn't	1
speak	1
much;	1
but,	1
when	1
he	1
does	1
speak,	1
then	1
you	1
may	1
well	1
listen.	1
Mark	1
ye,	1
be	1
forewarned;	1
Ahab's	1
above	1
the	1
common;	1
Ahab's	1
been	1
in	1
colleges,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
'mong	1
the	1
cannibals;	1
been	1
used	1
to	1
deeper	1
wonders	1
than	1
the	1
waves;	1
fixed	1
his	1
fiery	1
lance	1
in	1
mightier,	1
stranger	1
foes	1
than	1
whales.	1
His	1
lance!	1
aye,	1
the	1
keenest	1
and	1
the	1
surest	1
that	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
our	1
isle!	1
Oh!	1
he	1
ain't	1
Captain	1
Bildad;	1
no,	1
and	1
he	1
ain't	1
Captain	1
Peleg;	1
HE'S	1
AHAB,	1
boy;	1
and	1
Ahab	1
of	1
old,	1
thou	1
knowest,	1
was	1
a	1
crowned	1
king!"	1
"And	1
a	1
very	1
vile	1
one.	1
When	1
that	1
wicked	1
king	1
was	1
slain,	1
the	1
dogs,	1
did	1
they	1
not	1
lick	1
his	1
blood?"	1
"Come	1
hither	1
to	1
me--hither,	1
hither,"	1
said	1
Peleg,	1
with	1
a	1
significance	1
in	1
his	1
eye	1
that	1
almost	1
startled	1
me.	1
"Look	1
ye,	1
lad;	1
never	1
say	1
that	1
on	1
board	1
the	1
Pequod.	1
Never	1
say	1
it	1
anywhere.	1
Captain	1
Ahab	1
did	1
not	1
name	1
himself.	1
'Twas	1
a	1
foolish,	1
ignorant	1
whim	1
of	1
his	1
crazy,	1
widowed	1
mother,	1
who	1
died	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
only	1
a	1
twelvemonth	1
old.	1
And	1
yet	1
the	1
old	1
squaw	1
Tistig,	1
at	1
Gayhead,	1
said	1
that	1
the	1
name	1
would	1
somehow	1
prove	1
prophetic.	1
And,	1
perhaps,	1
other	1
fools	1
like	1
her	1
may	1
tell	1
thee	1
the	1
same.	1
I	1
wish	1
to	1
warn	1
thee.	1
It's	1
a	1
lie.	1
I	1
know	1
Captain	1
Ahab	1
well;	1
I've	1
sailed	1
with	1
him	1
as	1
mate	1
years	1
ago;	1
I	1
know	1
what	1
he	1
is--a	1
good	1
man--not	1
a	1
pious,	1
good	1
man,	1
like	1
Bildad,	1
but	1
a	1
swearing	1
good	1
man--something	1
like	1
me--only	1
there's	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
more	1
of	1
him.	1
Aye,	1
aye,	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
never	1
very	1
jolly;	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
on	1
the	1
passage	1
home,	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
mind	1
for	1
a	1
spell;	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
sharp	1
shooting	1
pains	1
in	1
his	1
bleeding	1
stump	1
that	1
brought	1
that	1
about,	1
as	1
any	1
one	1
might	1
see.	1
I	1
know,	1
too,	1
that	1
ever	1
since	1
he	1
lost	1
his	1
leg	1
last	1
voyage	1
by	1
that	1
accursed	1
whale,	1
he's	1
been	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
moody--desperate	1
moody,	1
and	1
savage	1
sometimes;	1
but	1
that	1
will	1
all	1
pass	1
off.	1
And	1
once	1
for	1
all,	1
let	1
me	1
tell	1
thee	1
and	1
assure	1
thee,	1
young	1
man,	1
it's	1
better	1
to	1
sail	1
with	1
a	1
moody	1
good	1
captain	1
than	1
a	1
laughing	1
bad	1
one.	1
So	1
good-bye	1
to	1
thee--and	1
wrong	1
not	1
Captain	1
Ahab,	1
because	1
he	1
happens	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
wicked	1
name.	1
Besides,	1
my	1
boy,	1
he	1
has	1
a	1
wife--not	1
three	1
voyages	1
wedded--a	1
sweet,	1
resigned	1
girl.	1
Think	1
of	1
that;	1
by	1
that	1
sweet	1
girl	1
that	1
old	1
man	1
has	1
a	1
child:	1
hold	1
ye	1
then	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
any	1
utter,	1
hopeless	1
harm	1
in	1
Ahab?	1
No,	1
no,	1
my	1
lad;	1
stricken,	1
blasted,	1
if	1
he	1
be,	1
Ahab	1
has	1
his	1
humanities!"	1
As	1
I	1
walked	1
away,	1
I	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
thoughtfulness;	1
what	1
had	1
been	1
incidentally	1
revealed	1
to	1
me	1
of	1
Captain	1
Ahab,	1
filled	1
me	1
with	1
a	1
certain	1
wild	1
vagueness	1
of	1
painfulness	1
concerning	1
him.	1
And	1
somehow,	1
at	1
the	1
time,	1
I	1
felt	1
a	1
sympathy	1
and	1
a	1
sorrow	1
for	1
him,	1
but	1
for	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
what,	1
unless	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
cruel	1
loss	1
of	1
his	1
leg.	1
And	1
yet	1
I	1
also	1
felt	1
a	1
strange	1
awe	1
of	1
him;	1
but	1
that	1
sort	1
of	1
awe,	1
which	1
I	1
cannot	1
at	1
all	1
describe,	1
was	1
not	1
exactly	1
awe;	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
it	1
was.	1
But	1
I	1
felt	1
it;	1
and	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
disincline	1
me	1
towards	1
him;	1
though	1
I	1
felt	1
impatience	1
at	1
what	1
seemed	1
like	1
mystery	1
in	1
him,	1
so	1
imperfectly	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
known	1
to	1
me	1
then.	1
However,	1
my	1
thoughts	1
were	1
at	1
length	1
carried	1
in	1
other	1
directions,	1
so	1
that	1
for	1
the	1
present	1
dark	1
Ahab	1
slipped	1
my	1
mind.	1
CHAPTER	1
17	1
The	1
Ramadan.	1
As	1
Queequeg's	1
Ramadan,	1
or	1
Fasting	1
and	1
Humiliation,	1
was	1
to	1
continue	1
all	1
day,	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
choose	1
to	1
disturb	1
him	1
till	1
towards	1
night-fall;	1
for	1
I	1
cherish	1
the	1
greatest	1
respect	1
towards	1
everybody's	1
religious	1
obligations,	1
never	1
mind	1
how	1
comical,	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
find	1
it	1
in	1
my	1
heart	1
to	1
undervalue	1
even	1
a	1
congregation	1
of	1
ants	1
worshipping	1
a	1
toad-stool;	1
or	1
those	1
other	1
creatures	1
in	1
certain	1
parts	1
of	1
our	1
earth,	1
who	1
with	1
a	1
degree	1
of	1
footmanism	1
quite	1
unprecedented	1
in	1
other	1
planets,	1
bow	1
down	1
before	1
the	1
torso	1
of	1
a	1
deceased	1
landed	1
proprietor	1
merely	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
inordinate	1
possessions	1
yet	1
owned	1
and	1
rented	1
in	1
his	1
name.	1
I	1
say,	1
we	1
good	1
Presbyterian	1
Christians	1
should	1
be	1
charitable	1
in	1
these	1
things,	1
and	1
not	1
fancy	1
ourselves	1
so	1
vastly	1
superior	1
to	1
other	1
mortals,	1
pagans	1
and	1
what	1
not,	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
half-crazy	1
conceits	1
on	1
these	1
subjects.	1
There	1
was	1
Queequeg,	1
now,	1
certainly	1
entertaining	1
the	1
most	1
absurd	1
notions	1
about	1
Yojo	1
and	1
his	1
Ramadan;--but	1
what	1
of	1
that?	1
Queequeg	1
thought	1
he	1
knew	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
about,	1
I	1
suppose;	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
content;	1
and	1
there	1
let	1
him	1
rest.	1
All	1
our	1
arguing	1
with	1
him	1
would	1
not	1
avail;	1
let	1
him	1
be,	1
I	1
say:	1
and	1
Heaven	1
have	1
mercy	1
on	1
us	1
all--Presbyterians	1
and	1
Pagans	1
alike--for	1
we	1
are	1
all	1
somehow	1
dreadfully	1
cracked	1
about	1
the	1
head,	1
and	1
sadly	1
need	1
mending.	1
Towards	1
evening,	1
when	1
I	1
felt	1
assured	1
that	1
all	1
his	1
performances	1
and	1
rituals	1
must	1
be	1
over,	1
I	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
room	1
and	1
knocked	1
at	1
the	1
door;	1
but	1
no	1
answer.	1
I	1
tried	1
to	1
open	1
it,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
fastened	1
inside.	1
"Queequeg,"	1
said	1
I	1
softly	1
through	1
the	1
key-hole:--all	1
silent.	1
"I	1
say,	1
Queequeg!	1
why	1
don't	1
you	1
speak?	1
It's	1
I--Ishmael."	1
But	1
all	1
remained	1
still	1
as	1
before.	1
I	1
began	1
to	1
grow	1
alarmed.	1
I	1
had	1
allowed	1
him	1
such	1
abundant	1
time;	1
I	1
thought	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
had	1
an	1
apoplectic	1
fit.	1
I	1
looked	1
through	1
the	1
key-hole;	1
but	1
the	1
door	1
opening	1
into	1
an	1
odd	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
room,	1
the	1
key-hole	1
prospect	1
was	1
but	1
a	1
crooked	1
and	1
sinister	1
one.	1
I	1
could	1
only	1
see	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
foot-board	1
of	1
the	1
bed	1
and	1
a	1
line	1
of	1
the	1
wall,	1
but	1
nothing	1
more.	1
I	1
was	1
surprised	1
to	1
behold	1
resting	1
against	1
the	1
wall	1
the	1
wooden	1
shaft	1
of	1
Queequeg's	1
harpoon,	1
which	1
the	1
landlady	1
the	1
evening	1
previous	1
had	1
taken	1
from	1
him,	1
before	1
our	1
mounting	1
to	1
the	1
chamber.	1
That's	1
strange,	1
thought	1
I;	1
but	1
at	1
any	1
rate,	1
since	1
the	1
harpoon	1
stands	1
yonder,	1
and	1
he	1
seldom	1
or	1
never	1
goes	1
abroad	1
without	1
it,	1
therefore	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
inside	1
here,	1
and	1
no	1
possible	1
mistake.	1
"Queequeg!--Queequeg!"--all	1
still.	1
Something	1
must	1
have	1
happened.	1
Apoplexy!	1
I	1
tried	1
to	1
burst	1
open	1
the	1
door;	1
but	1
it	1
stubbornly	1
resisted.	1
Running	1
down	1
stairs,	1
I	1
quickly	1
stated	1
my	1
suspicions	1
to	1
the	1
first	1
person	1
I	1
met--the	1
chamber-maid.	1
"La!	1
la!"	1
she	1
cried,	1
"I	1
thought	1
something	1
must	1
be	1
the	1
matter.	1
I	1
went	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
bed	1
after	1
breakfast,	1
and	1
the	1
door	1
was	1
locked;	1
and	1
not	1
a	1
mouse	1
to	1
be	1
heard;	1
and	1
it's	1
been	1
just	1
so	1
silent	1
ever	1
since.	1
But	1
I	1
thought,	1
may	1
be,	1
you	1
had	1
both	1
gone	1
off	1
and	1
locked	1
your	1
baggage	1
in	1
for	1
safe	1
keeping.	1
La!	1
la,	1
ma'am!--Mistress!	1
murder!	1
Mrs.	1
Hussey!	1
apoplexy!"--and	1
with	1
these	1
cries,	1
she	1
ran	1
towards	1
the	1
kitchen,	1
I	1
following.	1
Mrs.	1
Hussey	1
soon	1
appeared,	1
with	1
a	1
mustard-pot	1
in	1
one	1
hand	1
and	1
a	1
vinegar-cruet	1
in	1
the	1
other,	1
having	1
just	1
broken	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
occupation	1
of	1
attending	1
to	1
the	1
castors,	1
and	1
scolding	1
her	1
little	1
black	1
boy	1
meantime.	1
"Wood-house!"	1
cried	1
I,	1
"which	1
way	1
to	1
it?	1
Run	1
for	1
God's	1
sake,	1
and	1
fetch	1
something	1
to	1
pry	1
open	1
the	1
door--the	1
axe!--the	1
axe!	1
he's	1
had	1
a	1
stroke;	1
depend	1
upon	1
it!"--and	1
so	1
saying	1
I	1
was	1
unmethodically	1
rushing	1
up	1
stairs	1
again	1
empty-handed,	1
when	1
Mrs.	1
Hussey	1
interposed	1
the	1
mustard-pot	1
and	1
vinegar-cruet,	1
and	1
the	1
entire	1
castor	1
of	1
her	1
countenance.	1
"What's	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
you,	1
young	1
man?"	1
"Get	1
the	1
axe!	1
For	1
God's	1
sake,	1
run	1
for	1
the	1
doctor,	1
some	1
one,	1
while	1
I	1
pry	1
it	1
open!"	1
"Look	1
here,"	1
said	1
the	1
landlady,	1
quickly	1
putting	1
down	1
the	1
vinegar-cruet,	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
have	1
one	1
hand	1
free;	1
"look	1
here;	1
are	1
you	1
talking	1
about	1
prying	1
open	1
any	1
of	1
my	1
doors?"--and	1
with	1
that	1
she	1
seized	1
my	1
arm.	1
"What's	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
you?	1
What's	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
you,	1
shipmate?"	1
In	1
as	1
calm,	1
but	1
rapid	1
a	1
manner	1
as	1
possible,	1
I	1
gave	1
her	1
to	1
understand	1
the	1
whole	1
case.	1
Unconsciously	1
clapping	1
the	1
vinegar-cruet	1
to	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
her	1
nose,	1
she	1
ruminated	1
for	1
an	1
instant;	1
then	1
exclaimed--"No!	1
I	1
haven't	1
seen	1
it	1
since	1
I	1
put	1
it	1
there."	1
Running	1
to	1
a	1
little	1
closet	1
under	1
the	1
landing	1
of	1
the	1
stairs,	1
she	1
glanced	1
in,	1
and	1
returning,	1
told	1
me	1
that	1
Queequeg's	1
harpoon	1
was	1
missing.	1
"He's	1
killed	1
himself,"	1
she	1
cried.	1
"It's	1
unfort'nate	1
Stiggs	1
done	1
over	1
again	1
there	1
goes	1
another	1
counterpane--God	1
pity	1
his	1
poor	1
mother!--it	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
ruin	1
of	1
my	1
house.	1
Has	1
the	1
poor	1
lad	1
a	1
sister?	1
Where's	1
that	1
girl?--there,	1
Betty,	1
go	1
to	1
Snarles	1
the	1
Painter,	1
and	1
tell	1
him	1
to	1
paint	1
me	1
a	1
sign,	1
with--"no	1
suicides	1
permitted	1
here,	1
and	1
no	1
smoking	1
in	1
the	1
parlor;"--might	1
as	1
well	1
kill	1
both	1
birds	1
at	1
once.	1
Kill?	1
The	1
Lord	1
be	1
merciful	1
to	1
his	1
ghost!	1
What's	1
that	1
noise	1
there?	1
You,	1
young	1
man,	1
avast	1
there!"	1
And	1
running	1
up	1
after	1
me,	1
she	1
caught	1
me	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
again	1
trying	1
to	1
force	1
open	1
the	1
door.	1
"I	1
don't	1
allow	1
it;	1
I	1
won't	1
have	1
my	1
premises	1
spoiled.	1
Go	1
for	1
the	1
locksmith,	1
there's	1
one	1
about	1
a	1
mile	1
from	1
here.	1
But	1
avast!"	1
putting	1
her	1
hand	1
in	1
her	1
side-pocket,	1
"here's	1
a	1
key	1
that'll	1
fit,	1
I	1
guess;	1
let's	1
see."	1
And	1
with	1
that,	1
she	1
turned	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
lock;	1
but,	1
alas!	1
Queequeg's	1
supplemental	1
bolt	1
remained	1
unwithdrawn	1
within.	1
"Have	1
to	1
burst	1
it	1
open,"	1
said	1
I,	1
and	1
was	1
running	1
down	1
the	1
entry	1
a	1
little,	1
for	1
a	1
good	1
start,	1
when	1
the	1
landlady	1
caught	1
at	1
me,	1
again	1
vowing	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
break	1
down	1
her	1
premises;	1
but	1
I	1
tore	1
from	1
her,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
sudden	1
bodily	1
rush	1
dashed	1
myself	1
full	1
against	1
the	1
mark.	1
With	1
a	1
prodigious	1
noise	1
the	1
door	1
flew	1
open,	1
and	1
the	1
knob	1
slamming	1
against	1
the	1
wall,	1
sent	1
the	1
plaster	1
to	1
the	1
ceiling;	1
and	1
there,	1
good	1
heavens!	1
there	1
sat	1
Queequeg,	1
altogether	1
cool	1
and	1
self-collected;	1
right	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
room;	1
squatting	1
on	1
his	1
hams,	1
and	1
holding	1
Yojo	1
on	1
top	1
of	1
his	1
head.	1
He	1
looked	1
neither	1
one	1
way	1
nor	1
the	1
other	1
way,	1
but	1
sat	1
like	1
a	1
carved	1
image	1
with	1
scarce	1
a	1
sign	1
of	1
active	1
life.	1
"Queequeg,"	1
said	1
I,	1
going	1
up	1
to	1
him,	1
"Queequeg,	1
what's	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
you?"	1
"He	1
hain't	1
been	1
a	1
sittin'	1
so	1
all	1
day,	1
has	1
he?"	1
said	1
the	1
landlady.	1
But	1
all	1
we	1
said,	1
not	1
a	1
word	1
could	1
we	1
drag	1
out	1
of	1
him;	1
I	1
almost	1
felt	1
like	1
pushing	1
him	1
over,	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
change	1
his	1
position,	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
almost	1
intolerable,	1
it	1
seemed	1
so	1
painfully	1
and	1
unnaturally	1
constrained;	1
especially,	1
as	1
in	1
all	1
probability	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
sitting	1
so	1
for	1
upwards	1
of	1
eight	1
or	1
ten	1
hours,	1
going	1
too	1
without	1
his	1
regular	1
meals.	1
"Mrs.	1
Hussey,"	1
said	1
I,	1
"he's	1
ALIVE	1
at	1
all	1
events;	1
so	1
leave	1
us,	1
if	1
you	1
please,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
see	1
to	1
this	1
strange	1
affair	1
myself."	1
Closing	1
the	1
door	1
upon	1
the	1
landlady,	1
I	1
endeavored	1
to	1
prevail	1
upon	1
Queequeg	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
chair;	1
but	1
in	1
vain.	1
There	1
he	1
sat;	1
and	1
all	1
he	1
could	1
do--for	1
all	1
my	1
polite	1
arts	1
and	1
blandishments--he	1
would	1
not	1
move	1
a	1
peg,	1
nor	1
say	1
a	1
single	1
word,	1
nor	1
even	1
look	1
at	1
me,	1
nor	1
notice	1
my	1
presence	1
in	1
the	1
slightest	1
way.	1
I	1
wonder,	1
thought	1
I,	1
if	1
this	1
can	1
possibly	1
be	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
Ramadan;	1
do	1
they	1
fast	1
on	1
their	1
hams	1
that	1
way	1
in	1
his	1
native	1
island.	1
It	1
must	1
be	1
so;	1
yes,	1
it's	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
creed,	1
I	1
suppose;	1
well,	1
then,	1
let	1
him	1
rest;	1
he'll	1
get	1
up	1
sooner	1
or	1
later,	1
no	1
doubt.	1
It	1
can't	1
last	1
for	1
ever,	1
thank	1
God,	1
and	1
his	1
Ramadan	1
only	1
comes	1
once	1
a	1
year;	1
and	1
I	1
don't	1
believe	1
it's	1
very	1
punctual	1
then.	1
I	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
supper.	1
After	1
sitting	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
long	1
stories	1
of	1
some	1
sailors	1
who	1
had	1
just	1
come	1
from	1
a	1
plum-pudding	1
voyage,	1
as	1
they	1
called	1
it	1
(that	1
is,	1
a	1
short	1
whaling-voyage	1
in	1
a	1
schooner	1
or	1
brig,	1
confined	1
to	1
the	1
north	1
of	1
the	1
line,	1
in	1
the	1
Atlantic	1
Ocean	1
only);	1
after	1
listening	1
to	1
these	1
plum-puddingers	1
till	1
nearly	1
eleven	1
o'clock,	1
I	1
went	1
up	1
stairs	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
bed,	1
feeling	1
quite	1
sure	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
Queequeg	1
must	1
certainly	1
have	1
brought	1
his	1
Ramadan	1
to	1
a	1
termination.	1
But	1
no;	1
there	1
he	1
was	1
just	1
where	1
I	1
had	1
left	1
him;	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
stirred	1
an	1
inch.	1
I	1
began	1
to	1
grow	1
vexed	1
with	1
him;	1
it	1
seemed	1
so	1
downright	1
senseless	1
and	1
insane	1
to	1
be	1
sitting	1
there	1
all	1
day	1
and	1
half	1
the	1
night	1
on	1
his	1
hams	1
in	1
a	1
cold	1
room,	1
holding	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
wood	1
on	1
his	1
head.	1
"For	1
heaven's	1
sake,	1
Queequeg,	1
get	1
up	1
and	1
shake	1
yourself;	1
get	1
up	1
and	1
have	1
some	1
supper.	1
You'll	1
starve;	1
you'll	1
kill	1
yourself,	1
Queequeg."	1
But	1
not	1
a	1
word	1
did	1
he	1
reply.	1
Despairing	1
of	1
him,	1
therefore,	1
I	1
determined	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
bed	1
and	1
to	1
sleep;	1
and	1
no	1
doubt,	1
before	1
a	1
great	1
while,	1
he	1
would	1
follow	1
me.	1
But	1
previous	1
to	1
turning	1
in,	1
I	1
took	1
my	1
heavy	1
bearskin	1
jacket,	1
and	1
threw	1
it	1
over	1
him,	1
as	1
it	1
promised	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
very	1
cold	1
night;	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
nothing	1
but	1
his	1
ordinary	1
round	1
jacket	1
on.	1
For	1
some	1
time,	1
do	1
all	1
I	1
would,	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
get	1
into	1
the	1
faintest	1
doze.	1
I	1
had	1
blown	1
out	1
the	1
candle;	1
and	1
the	1
mere	1
thought	1
of	1
Queequeg--not	1
four	1
feet	1
off--sitting	1
there	1
in	1
that	1
uneasy	1
position,	1
stark	1
alone	1
in	1
the	1
cold	1
and	1
dark;	1
this	1
made	1
me	1
really	1
wretched.	1
Think	1
of	1
it;	1
sleeping	1
all	1
night	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
room	1
with	1
a	1
wide	1
awake	1
pagan	1
on	1
his	1
hams	1
in	1
this	1
dreary,	1
unaccountable	1
Ramadan!	1
But	1
somehow	1
I	1
dropped	1
off	1
at	1
last,	1
and	1
knew	1
nothing	1
more	1
till	1
break	1
of	1
day;	1
when,	1
looking	1
over	1
the	1
bedside,	1
there	1
squatted	1
Queequeg,	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
screwed	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
floor.	1
But	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
first	1
glimpse	1
of	1
sun	1
entered	1
the	1
window,	1
up	1
he	1
got,	1
with	1
stiff	1
and	1
grating	1
joints,	1
but	1
with	1
a	1
cheerful	1
look;	1
limped	1
towards	1
me	1
where	1
I	1
lay;	1
pressed	1
his	1
forehead	1
again	1
against	1
mine;	1
and	1
said	1
his	1
Ramadan	1
was	1
over.	1
Now,	1
as	1
I	1
before	1
hinted,	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
objection	1
to	1
any	1
person's	1
religion,	1
be	1
it	1
what	1
it	1
may,	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
that	1
person	1
does	1
not	1
kill	1
or	1
insult	1
any	1
other	1
person,	1
because	1
that	1
other	1
person	1
don't	1
believe	1
it	1
also.	1
But	1
when	1
a	1
man's	1
religion	1
becomes	1
really	1
frantic;	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
positive	1
torment	1
to	1
him;	1
and,	1
in	1
fine,	1
makes	1
this	1
earth	1
of	1
ours	1
an	1
uncomfortable	1
inn	1
to	1
lodge	1
in;	1
then	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
high	1
time	1
to	1
take	1
that	1
individual	1
aside	1
and	1
argue	1
the	1
point	1
with	1
him.	1
And	1
just	1
so	1
I	1
now	1
did	1
with	1
Queequeg.	1
"Queequeg,"	1
said	1
I,	1
"get	1
into	1
bed	1
now,	1
and	1
lie	1
and	1
listen	1
to	1
me."	1
I	1
then	1
went	1
on,	1
beginning	1
with	1
the	1
rise	1
and	1
progress	1
of	1
the	1
primitive	1
religions,	1
and	1
coming	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
various	1
religions	1
of	1
the	1
present	1
time,	1
during	1
which	1
time	1
I	1
labored	1
to	1
show	1
Queequeg	1
that	1
all	1
these	1
Lents,	1
Ramadans,	1
and	1
prolonged	1
ham-squattings	1
in	1
cold,	1
cheerless	1
rooms	1
were	1
stark	1
nonsense;	1
bad	1
for	1
the	1
health;	1
useless	1
for	1
the	1
soul;	1
opposed,	1
in	1
short,	1
to	1
the	1
obvious	1
laws	1
of	1
Hygiene	1
and	1
common	1
sense.	1
I	1
told	1
him,	1
too,	1
that	1
he	1
being	1
in	1
other	1
things	1
such	1
an	1
extremely	1
sensible	1
and	1
sagacious	1
savage,	1
it	1
pained	1
me,	1
very	1
badly	1
pained	1
me,	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
now	1
so	1
deplorably	1
foolish	1
about	1
this	1
ridiculous	1
Ramadan	1
of	1
his.	1
Besides,	1
argued	1
I,	1
fasting	1
makes	1
the	1
body	1
cave	1
in;	1
hence	1
the	1
spirit	1
caves	1
in;	1
and	1
all	1
thoughts	1
born	1
of	1
a	1
fast	1
must	1
necessarily	1
be	1
half-starved.	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
reason	1
why	1
most	1
dyspeptic	1
religionists	1
cherish	1
such	1
melancholy	1
notions	1
about	1
their	1
hereafters.	1
In	1
one	1
word,	1
Queequeg,	1
said	1
I,	1
rather	1
digressively;	1
hell	1
is	1
an	1
idea	1
first	1
born	1
on	1
an	1
undigested	1
apple-dumpling;	1
and	1
since	1
then	1
perpetuated	1
through	1
the	1
hereditary	1
dyspepsias	1
nurtured	1
by	1
Ramadans.	1
I	1
then	1
asked	1
Queequeg	1
whether	1
he	1
himself	1
was	1
ever	1
troubled	1
with	1
dyspepsia;	1
expressing	1
the	1
idea	1
very	1
plainly,	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
take	1
it	1
in.	1
He	1
said	1
no;	1
only	1
upon	1
one	1
memorable	1
occasion.	1
It	1
was	1
after	1
a	1
great	1
feast	1
given	1
by	1
his	1
father	1
the	1
king,	1
on	1
the	1
gaining	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
battle	1
wherein	1
fifty	1
of	1
the	1
enemy	1
had	1
been	1
killed	1
by	1
about	1
two	1
o'clock	1
in	1
the	1
afternoon,	1
and	1
all	1
cooked	1
and	1
eaten	1
that	1
very	1
evening.	1
"No	1
more,	1
Queequeg,"	1
said	1
I,	1
shuddering;	1
"that	1
will	1
do;"	1
for	1
I	1
knew	1
the	1
inferences	1
without	1
his	1
further	1
hinting	1
them.	1
I	1
had	1
seen	1
a	1
sailor	1
who	1
had	1
visited	1
that	1
very	1
island,	1
and	1
he	1
told	1
me	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
custom,	1
when	1
a	1
great	1
battle	1
had	1
been	1
gained	1
there,	1
to	1
barbecue	1
all	1
the	1
slain	1
in	1
the	1
yard	1
or	1
garden	1
of	1
the	1
victor;	1
and	1
then,	1
one	1
by	1
one,	1
they	1
were	1
placed	1
in	1
great	1
wooden	1
trenchers,	1
and	1
garnished	1
round	1
like	1
a	1
pilau,	1
with	1
breadfruit	1
and	1
cocoanuts;	1
and	1
with	1
some	1
parsley	1
in	1
their	1
mouths,	1
were	1
sent	1
round	1
with	1
the	1
victor's	1
compliments	1
to	1
all	1
his	1
friends,	1
just	1
as	1
though	1
these	1
presents	1
were	1
so	1
many	1
Christmas	1
turkeys.	1
After	1
all,	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
that	1
my	1
remarks	1
about	1
religion	1
made	1
much	1
impression	1
upon	1
Queequeg.	1
Because,	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
place,	1
he	1
somehow	1
seemed	1
dull	1
of	1
hearing	1
on	1
that	1
important	1
subject,	1
unless	1
considered	1
from	1
his	1
own	1
point	1
of	1
view;	1
and,	1
in	1
the	1
second	1
place,	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
more	1
than	1
one	1
third	1
understand	1
me,	1
couch	1
my	1
ideas	1
simply	1
as	1
I	1
would;	1
and,	1
finally,	1
he	1
no	1
doubt	1
thought	1
he	1
knew	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
more	1
about	1
the	1
true	1
religion	1
than	1
I	1
did.	1
He	1
looked	1
at	1
me	1
with	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
condescending	1
concern	1
and	1
compassion,	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
thought	1
it	1
a	1
great	1
pity	1
that	1
such	1
a	1
sensible	1
young	1
man	1
should	1
be	1
so	1
hopelessly	1
lost	1
to	1
evangelical	1
pagan	1
piety.	1
At	1
last	1
we	1
rose	1
and	1
dressed;	1
and	1
Queequeg,	1
taking	1
a	1
prodigiously	1
hearty	1
breakfast	1
of	1
chowders	1
of	1
all	1
sorts,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
landlady	1
should	1
not	1
make	1
much	1
profit	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
his	1
Ramadan,	1
we	1
sallied	1
out	1
to	1
board	1
the	1
Pequod,	1
sauntering	1
along,	1
and	1
picking	1
our	1
teeth	1
with	1
halibut	1
bones.	1
CHAPTER	1
18	1
His	1
Mark.	1
As	1
we	1
were	1
walking	1
down	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
wharf	1
towards	1
the	1
ship,	1
Queequeg	1
carrying	1
his	1
harpoon,	1
Captain	1
Peleg	1
in	1
his	1
gruff	1
voice	1
loudly	1
hailed	1
us	1
from	1
his	1
wigwam,	1
saying	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
suspected	1
my	1
friend	1
was	1
a	1
cannibal,	1
and	1
furthermore	1
announcing	1
that	1
he	1
let	1
no	1
cannibals	1
on	1
board	1
that	1
craft,	1
unless	1
they	1
previously	1
produced	1
their	1
papers.	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
mean	1
by	1
that,	1
Captain	1
Peleg?"	1
said	1
I,	1
now	1
jumping	1
on	1
the	1
bulwarks,	1
and	1
leaving	1
my	1
comrade	1
standing	1
on	1
the	1
wharf.	1
"I	1
mean,"	1
he	1
replied,	1
"he	1
must	1
show	1
his	1
papers."	1
"Yes,"	1
said	1
Captain	1
Bildad	1
in	1
his	1
hollow	1
voice,	1
sticking	1
his	1
head	1
from	1
behind	1
Peleg's,	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
wigwam.	1
"He	1
must	1
show	1
that	1
he's	1
converted.	1
Son	1
of	1
darkness,"	1
he	1
added,	1
turning	1
to	1
Queequeg,	1
"art	1
thou	1
at	1
present	1
in	1
communion	1
with	1
any	1
Christian	1
church?"	1
"Why,"	1
said	1
I,	1
"he's	1
a	1
member	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
Congregational	1
Church."	1
Here	1
be	1
it	1
said,	1
that	1
many	1
tattooed	1
savages	1
sailing	1
in	1
Nantucket	1
ships	1
at	1
last	1
come	1
to	1
be	1
converted	1
into	1
the	1
churches.	1
"First	1
Congregational	1
Church,"	1
cried	1
Bildad,	1
"what!	1
that	1
worships	1
in	1
Deacon	1
Deuteronomy	1
Coleman's	1
meeting-house?"	1
and	1
so	1
saying,	1
taking	1
out	1
his	1
spectacles,	1
he	1
rubbed	1
them	1
with	1
his	1
great	1
yellow	1
bandana	1
handkerchief,	1
and	1
putting	1
them	1
on	1
very	1
carefully,	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
wigwam,	1
and	1
leaning	1
stiffly	1
over	1
the	1
bulwarks,	1
took	1
a	1
good	1
long	1
look	1
at	1
Queequeg.	1
"How	1
long	1
hath	1
he	1
been	1
a	1
member?"	1
he	1
then	1
said,	1
turning	1
to	1
me;	1
"not	1
very	1
long,	1
I	1
rather	1
guess,	1
young	1
man."	1
"No,"	1
said	1
Peleg,	1
"and	1
he	1
hasn't	1
been	1
baptized	1
right	1
either,	1
or	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
washed	1
some	1
of	1
that	1
devil's	1
blue	1
off	1
his	1
face."	1
"Do	1
tell,	1
now,"	1
cried	1
Bildad,	1
"is	1
this	1
Philistine	1
a	1
regular	1
member	1
of	1
Deacon	1
Deuteronomy's	1
meeting?	1
I	1
never	1
saw	1
him	1
going	1
there,	1
and	1
I	1
pass	1
it	1
every	1
Lord's	1
day."	1
"I	1
don't	1
know	1
anything	1
about	1
Deacon	1
Deuteronomy	1
or	1
his	1
meeting,"	1
said	1
I;	1
"all	1
I	1
know	1
is,	1
that	1
Queequeg	1
here	1
is	1
a	1
born	1
member	1
of	1
the	1
First	1
Congregational	1
Church.	1
He	1
is	1
a	1
deacon	1
himself,	1
Queequeg	1
is."	1
"Young	1
man,"	1
said	1
Bildad	1
sternly,	1
"thou	1
art	1
skylarking	1
with	1
me--explain	1
thyself,	1
thou	1
young	1
Hittite.	1
What	1
church	1
dost	1
thee	1
mean?	1
answer	1
me."	1
Finding	1
myself	1
thus	1
hard	1
pushed,	1
I	1
replied.	1
"I	1
mean,	1
sir,	1
the	1
same	1
ancient	1
Catholic	1
Church	1
to	1
which	1
you	1
and	1
I,	1
and	1
Captain	1
Peleg	1
there,	1
and	1
Queequeg	1
here,	1
and	1
all	1
of	1
us,	1
and	1
every	1
mother's	1
son	1
and	1
soul	1
of	1
us	1
belong;	1
the	1
great	1
and	1
everlasting	1
First	1
Congregation	1
of	1
this	1
whole	1
worshipping	1
world;	1
we	1
all	1
belong	1
to	1
that;	1
only	1
some	1
of	1
us	1
cherish	1
some	1
queer	1
crotchets	1
no	1
ways	1
touching	1
the	1
grand	1
belief;	1
in	1
THAT	1
we	1
all	1
join	1
hands."	1
"Splice,	1
thou	1
mean'st	1
SPLICE	1
hands,"	1
cried	1
Peleg,	1
drawing	1
nearer.	1
"Young	1
man,	1
you'd	1
better	1
ship	1
for	1
a	1
missionary,	1
instead	1
of	1
a	1
fore-mast	1
hand;	1
I	1
never	1
heard	1
a	1
better	1
sermon.	1
Deacon	1
Deuteronomy--why	1
Father	1
Mapple	1
himself	1
couldn't	1
beat	1
it,	1
and	1
he's	1
reckoned	1
something.	1
Come	1
aboard,	1
come	1
aboard;	1
never	1
mind	1
about	1
the	1
papers.	1
I	1
say,	1
tell	1
Quohog	1
there--what's	1
that	1
you	1
call	1
him?	1
tell	1
Quohog	1
to	1
step	1
along.	1
By	1
the	1
great	1
anchor,	1
what	1
a	1
harpoon	1
he's	1
got	1
there!	1
looks	1
like	1
good	1
stuff	1
that;	1
and	1
he	1
handles	1
it	1
about	1
right.	1
I	1
say,	1
Quohog,	1
or	1
whatever	1
your	1
name	1
is,	1
did	1
you	1
ever	1
stand	1
in	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
a	1
whale-boat?	1
did	1
you	1
ever	1
strike	1
a	1
fish?"	1
Without	1
saying	1
a	1
word,	1
Queequeg,	1
in	1
his	1
wild	1
sort	1
of	1
way,	1
jumped	1
upon	1
the	1
bulwarks,	1
from	1
thence	1
into	1
the	1
bows	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
whale-boats	1
hanging	1
to	1
the	1
side;	1
and	1
then	1
bracing	1
his	1
left	1
knee,	1
and	1
poising	1
his	1
harpoon,	1
cried	1
out	1
in	1
some	1
such	1
way	1
as	1
this:--	1
"Cap'ain,	1
you	1
see	1
him	1
small	1
drop	1
tar	1
on	1
water	1
dere?	1
You	1
see	1
him?	1
well,	1
spose	1
him	1
one	1
whale	1
eye,	1
well,	1
den!"	1
and	1
taking	1
sharp	1
aim	1
at	1
it,	1
he	1
darted	1
the	1
iron	1
right	1
over	1
old	1
Bildad's	1
broad	1
brim,	1
clean	1
across	1
the	1
ship's	1
decks,	1
and	1
struck	1
the	1
glistening	1
tar	1
spot	1
out	1
of	1
sight.	1
"Now,"	1
said	1
Queequeg,	1
quietly	1
hauling	1
in	1
the	1
line,	1
"spos-ee	1
him	1
whale-e	1
eye;	1
why,	1
dad	1
whale	1
dead."	1
"Quick,	1
Bildad,"	1
said	1
Peleg,	1
his	1
partner,	1
who,	1
aghast	1
at	1
the	1
close	1
vicinity	1
of	1
the	1
flying	1
harpoon,	1
had	1
retreated	1
towards	1
the	1
cabin	1
gangway.	1
"Quick,	1
I	1
say,	1
you	1
Bildad,	1
and	1
get	1
the	1
ship's	1
papers.	1
We	1
must	1
have	1
Hedgehog	1
there,	1
I	1
mean	1
Quohog,	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
our	1
boats.	1
Look	1
ye,	1
Quohog,	1
we'll	1
give	1
ye	1
the	1
ninetieth	1
lay,	1
and	1
that's	1
more	1
than	1
ever	1
was	1
given	1
a	1
harpooneer	1
yet	1
out	1
of	1
Nantucket."	1
So	1
down	1
we	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
cabin,	1
and	1
to	1
my	1
great	1
joy	1
Queequeg	1
was	1
soon	1
enrolled	1
among	1
the	1
same	1
ship's	1
company	1
to	1
which	1
I	1
myself	1
belonged.	1
When	1
all	1
preliminaries	1
were	1
over	1
and	1
Peleg	1
had	1
got	1
everything	1
ready	1
for	1
signing,	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
said,	1
"I	1
guess,	1
Quohog	1
there	1
don't	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
write,	1
does	1
he?	1
I	1
say,	1
Quohog,	1
blast	1
ye!	1
dost	1
thou	1
sign	1
thy	1
name	1
or	1
make	1
thy	1
mark?	1
But	1
at	1
this	1
question,	1
Queequeg,	1
who	1
had	1
twice	1
or	1
thrice	1
before	1
taken	1
part	1
in	1
similar	1
ceremonies,	1
looked	1
no	1
ways	1
abashed;	1
but	1
taking	1
the	1
offered	1
pen,	1
copied	1
upon	1
the	1
paper,	1
in	1
the	1
proper	1
place,	1
an	1
exact	1
counterpart	1
of	1
a	1
queer	1
round	1
figure	1
which	1
was	1
tattooed	1
upon	1
his	1
arm;	1
so	1
that	1
through	1
Captain	1
Peleg's	1
obstinate	1
mistake	1
touching	1
his	1
appellative,	1
it	1
stood	1
something	1
like	1
this:--	1
Quohog.	1
his	1
X	1
mark.	1
Meanwhile	1
Captain	1
Bildad	1
sat	1
earnestly	1
and	1
steadfastly	1
eyeing	1
Queequeg,	1
and	1
at	1
last	1
rising	1
solemnly	1
and	1
fumbling	1
in	1
the	1
huge	1
pockets	1
of	1
his	1
broad-skirted	1
drab	1
coat,	1
took	1
out	1
a	1
bundle	1
of	1
tracts,	1
and	1
selecting	1
one	1
entitled	1
"The	1
Latter	1
Day	1
Coming;	1
or	1
No	1
Time	1
to	1
Lose,"	1
placed	1
it	1
in	1
Queequeg's	1
hands,	1
and	1
then	1
grasping	1
them	1
and	1
the	1
book	1
with	1
both	1
his,	1
looked	1
earnestly	1
into	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
said,	1
"Son	1
of	1
darkness,	1
I	1
must	1
do	1
my	1
duty	1
by	1
thee;	1
I	1
am	1
part	1
owner	1
of	1
this	1
ship,	1
and	1
feel	1
concerned	1
for	1
the	1
souls	1
of	1
all	1
its	1
crew;	1
if	1
thou	1
still	1
clingest	1
to	1
thy	1
Pagan	1
ways,	1
which	1
I	1
sadly	1
fear,	1
I	1
beseech	1
thee,	1
remain	1
not	1
for	1
aye	1
a	1
Belial	1
bondsman.	1
Spurn	1
the	1
idol	1
Bell,	1
and	1
the	1
hideous	1
dragon;	1
turn	1
from	1
the	1
wrath	1
to	1
come;	1
mind	1
thine	1
eye,	1
I	1
say;	1
oh!	1
goodness	1
gracious!	1
steer	1
clear	1
of	1
the	1
fiery	1
pit!"	1
Something	1
of	1
the	1
salt	1
sea	1
yet	1
lingered	1
in	1
old	1
Bildad's	1
language,	1
heterogeneously	1
mixed	1
with	1
Scriptural	1
and	1
domestic	1
phrases.	1
"Avast	1
there,	1
avast	1
there,	1
Bildad,	1
avast	1
now	1
spoiling	1
our	1
harpooneer,"	1
Peleg.	1
"Pious	1
harpooneers	1
never	1
make	1
good	1
voyagers--it	1
takes	1
the	1
shark	1
out	1
of	1
'em;	1
no	1
harpooneer	1
is	1
worth	1
a	1
straw	1
who	1
aint	1
pretty	1
sharkish.	1
There	1
was	1
young	1
Nat	1
Swaine,	1
once	1
the	1
bravest	1
boat-header	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
Nantucket	1
and	1
the	1
Vineyard;	1
he	1
joined	1
the	1
meeting,	1
and	1
never	1
came	1
to	1
good.	1
He	1
got	1
so	1
frightened	1
about	1
his	1
plaguy	1
soul,	1
that	1
he	1
shrinked	1
and	1
sheered	1
away	1
from	1
whales,	1
for	1
fear	1
of	1
after-claps,	1
in	1
case	1
he	1
got	1
stove	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
Davy	1
Jones."	1
"Peleg!	1
Peleg!"	1
said	1
Bildad,	1
lifting	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
hands,	1
"thou	1
thyself,	1
as	1
I	1
myself,	1
hast	1
seen	1
many	1
a	1
perilous	1
time;	1
thou	1
knowest,	1
Peleg,	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
death;	1
how,	1
then,	1
can'st	1
thou	1
prate	1
in	1
this	1
ungodly	1
guise.	1
Thou	1
beliest	1
thine	1
own	1
heart,	1
Peleg.	1
Tell	1
me,	1
when	1
this	1
same	1
Pequod	1
here	1
had	1
her	1
three	1
masts	1
overboard	1
in	1
that	1
typhoon	1
on	1
Japan,	1
that	1
same	1
voyage	1
when	1
thou	1
went	1
mate	1
with	1
Captain	1
Ahab,	1
did'st	1
thou	1
not	1
think	1
of	1
Death	1
and	1
the	1
Judgment	1
then?"	1
"Hear	1
him,	1
hear	1
him	1
now,"	1
cried	1
Peleg,	1
marching	1
across	1
the	1
cabin,	1
and	1
thrusting	1
his	1
hands	1
far	1
down	1
into	1
his	1
pockets,--"hear	1
him,	1
all	1
of	1
ye.	1
Think	1
of	1
that!	1
When	1
every	1
moment	1
we	1
thought	1
the	1
ship	1
would	1
sink!	1
Death	1
and	1
the	1
Judgment	1
then?	1
What?	1
With	1
all	1
three	1
masts	1
making	1
such	1
an	1
everlasting	1
thundering	1
against	1
the	1
side;	1
and	1
every	1
sea	1
breaking	1
over	1
us,	1
fore	1
and	1
aft.	1
Think	1
of	1
Death	1
and	1
the	1
Judgment	1
then?	1
No!	1
no	1
time	1
to	1
think	1
about	1
Death	1
then.	1
Life	1
was	1
what	1
Captain	1
Ahab	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
thinking	1
of;	1
and	1
how	1
to	1
save	1
all	1
hands--how	1
to	1
rig	1
jury-masts--how	1
to	1
get	1
into	1
the	1
nearest	1
port;	1
that	1
was	1
what	1
I	1
was	1
thinking	1
of."	1
Bildad	1
said	1
no	1
more,	1
but	1
buttoning	1
up	1
his	1
coat,	1
stalked	1
on	1
deck,	1
where	1
we	1
followed	1
him.	1
There	1
he	1
stood,	1
very	1
quietly	1
overlooking	1
some	1
sailmakers	1
who	1
were	1
mending	1
a	1
top-sail	1
in	1
the	1
waist.	1
Now	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
stooped	1
to	1
pick	1
up	1
a	1
patch,	1
or	1
save	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
tarred	1
twine,	1
which	1
otherwise	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
wasted.	1
CHAPTER	1
19	1
The	1
Prophet.	1
"Shipmates,	1
have	1
ye	1
shipped	1
in	1
that	1
ship?"	1
Queequeg	1
and	1
I	1
had	1
just	1
left	1
the	1
Pequod,	1
and	1
were	1
sauntering	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
water,	1
for	1
the	1
moment	1
each	1
occupied	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
thoughts,	1
when	1
the	1
above	1
words	1
were	1
put	1
to	1
us	1
by	1
a	1
stranger,	1
who,	1
pausing	1
before	1
us,	1
levelled	1
his	1
massive	1
forefinger	1
at	1
the	1
vessel	1
in	1
question.	1
He	1
was	1
but	1
shabbily	1
apparelled	1
in	1
faded	1
jacket	1
and	1
patched	1
trowsers;	1
a	1
rag	1
of	1
a	1
black	1
handkerchief	1
investing	1
his	1
neck.	1
A	1
confluent	1
small-pox	1
had	1
in	1
all	1
directions	1
flowed	1
over	1
his	1
face,	1
and	1
left	1
it	1
like	1
the	1
complicated	1
ribbed	1
bed	1
of	1
a	1
torrent,	1
when	1
the	1
rushing	1
waters	1
have	1
been	1
dried	1
up.	1
"Have	1
ye	1
shipped	1
in	1
her?"	1
he	1
repeated.	1
"You	1
mean	1
the	1
ship	1
Pequod,	1
I	1
suppose,"	1
said	1
I,	1
trying	1
to	1
gain	1
a	1
little	1
more	1
time	1
for	1
an	1
uninterrupted	1
look	1
at	1
him.	1
"Aye,	1
the	1
Pequod--that	1
ship	1
there,"	1
he	1
said,	1
drawing	1
back	1
his	1
whole	1
arm,	1
and	1
then	1
rapidly	1
shoving	1
it	1
straight	1
out	1
from	1
him,	1
with	1
the	1
fixed	1
bayonet	1
of	1
his	1
pointed	1
finger	1
darted	1
full	1
at	1
the	1
object.	1
"Yes,"	1
said	1
I,	1
"we	1
have	1
just	1
signed	1
the	1
articles."	1
"Anything	1
down	1
there	1
about	1
your	1
souls?"	1
"About	1
what?"	1
"Oh,	1
perhaps	1
you	1
hav'n't	1
got	1
any,"	1
he	1
said	1
quickly.	1
"No	1
matter	1
though,	1
I	1
know	1
many	1
chaps	1
that	1
hav'n't	1
got	1
any,--good	1
luck	1
to	1
'em;	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
all	1
the	1
better	1
off	1
for	1
it.	1
A	1
soul's	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
a	1
fifth	1
wheel	1
to	1
a	1
wagon."	1
"What	1
are	1
you	1
jabbering	1
about,	1
shipmate?"	1
said	1
I.	1
"HE'S	1
got	1
enough,	1
though,	1
to	1
make	1
up	1
for	1
all	1
deficiencies	1
of	1
that	1
sort	1
in	1
other	1
chaps,"	1
abruptly	1
said	1
the	1
stranger,	1
placing	1
a	1
nervous	1
emphasis	1
upon	1
the	1
word	1
HE.	1
"Queequeg,"	1
said	1
I,	1
"let's	1
go;	1
this	1
fellow	1
has	1
broken	1
loose	1
from	1
somewhere;	1
he's	1
talking	1
about	1
something	1
and	1
somebody	1
we	1
don't	1
know."	1
"Stop!"	1
cried	1
the	1
stranger.	1
"Ye	1
said	1
true--ye	1
hav'n't	1
seen	1
Old	1
Thunder	1
yet,	1
have	1
ye?"	1
"Who's	1
Old	1
Thunder?"	1
said	1
I,	1
again	1
riveted	1
with	1
the	1
insane	1
earnestness	1
of	1
his	1
manner.	1
"Captain	1
Ahab."	1
"What!	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
our	1
ship,	1
the	1
Pequod?"	1
"Aye,	1
among	1
some	1
of	1
us	1
old	1
sailor	1
chaps,	1
he	1
goes	1
by	1
that	1
name.	1
Ye	1
hav'n't	1
seen	1
him	1
yet,	1
have	1
ye?"	1
"No,	1
we	1
hav'n't.	1
He's	1
sick	1
they	1
say,	1
but	1
is	1
getting	1
better,	1
and	1
will	1
be	1
all	1
right	1
again	1
before	1
long."	1
"All	1
right	1
again	1
before	1
long!"	1
laughed	1
the	1
stranger,	1
with	1
a	1
solemnly	1
derisive	1
sort	1
of	1
laugh.	1
"Look	1
ye;	1
when	1
Captain	1
Ahab	1
is	1
all	1
right,	1
then	1
this	1
left	1
arm	1
of	1
mine	1
will	1
be	1
all	1
right;	1
not	1
before."	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
about	1
him?"	1
"What	1
did	1
they	1
TELL	1
you	1
about	1
him?	1
Say	1
that!"	1
"They	1
didn't	1
tell	1
much	1
of	1
anything	1
about	1
him;	1
only	1
I've	1
heard	1
that	1
he's	1
a	1
good	1
whale-hunter,	1
and	1
a	1
good	1
captain	1
to	1
his	1
crew."	1
"That's	1
true,	1
that's	1
true--yes,	1
both	1
true	1
enough.	1
But	1
you	1
must	1
jump	1
when	1
he	1
gives	1
an	1
order.	1
Step	1
and	1
growl;	1
growl	1
and	1
go--that's	1
the	1
word	1
with	1
Captain	1
Ahab.	1
But	1
nothing	1
about	1
that	1
thing	1
that	1
happened	1
to	1
him	1
off	1
Cape	1
Horn,	1
long	1
ago,	1
when	1
he	1
lay	1
like	1
dead	1
for	1
three	1
days	1
and	1
nights;	1
nothing	1
about	1
that	1
deadly	1
skrimmage	1
with	1
the	1
Spaniard	1
afore	1
the	1
altar	1
in	1
Santa?--heard	1
nothing	1
about	1
that,	1
eh?	1
Nothing	1
about	1
the	1
silver	1
calabash	1
he	1
spat	1
into?	1
And	1
nothing	1
about	1
his	1
losing	1
his	1
leg	1
last	1
voyage,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
prophecy.	1
Didn't	1
ye	1
hear	1
a	1
word	1
about	1
them	1
matters	1
and	1
something	1
more,	1
eh?	1
No,	1
I	1
don't	1
think	1
ye	1
did;	1
how	1
could	1
ye?	1
Who	1
knows	1
it?	1
Not	1
all	1
Nantucket,	1
I	1
guess.	1
But	1
hows'ever,	1
mayhap,	1
ye've	1
heard	1
tell	1
about	1
the	1
leg,	1
and	1
how	1
he	1
lost	1
it;	1
aye,	1
ye	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
that,	1
I	1
dare	1
say.	1
Oh	1
yes,	1
THAT	1
every	1
one	1
knows	1
a'most--I	1
mean	1
they	1
know	1
he's	1
only	1
one	1
leg;	1
and	1
that	1
a	1
parmacetti	1
took	1
the	1
other	1
off."	1
"My	1
friend,"	1
said	1
I,	1
"what	1
all	1
this	1
gibberish	1
of	1
yours	1
is	1
about,	1
I	1
don't	1
know,	1
and	1
I	1
don't	1
much	1
care;	1
for	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
you	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
little	1
damaged	1
in	1
the	1
head.	1
But	1
if	1
you	1
are	1
speaking	1
of	1
Captain	1
Ahab,	1
of	1
that	1
ship	1
there,	1
the	1
Pequod,	1
then	1
let	1
me	1
tell	1
you,	1
that	1
I	1
know	1
all	1
about	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
his	1
leg."	1
"ALL	1
about	1
it,	1
eh--sure	1
you	1
do?--all?"	1
"Pretty	1
sure."	1
With	1
finger	1
pointed	1
and	1
eye	1
levelled	1
at	1
the	1
Pequod,	1
the	1
beggar-like	1
stranger	1
stood	1
a	1
moment,	1
as	1
if	1
in	1
a	1
troubled	1
reverie;	1
then	1
starting	1
a	1
little,	1
turned	1
and	1
said:--"Ye've	1
shipped,	1
have	1
ye?	1
Names	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
papers?	1
Well,	1
well,	1
what's	1
signed,	1
is	1
signed;	1
and	1
what's	1
to	1
be,	1
will	1
be;	1
and	1
then	1
again,	1
perhaps	1
it	1
won't	1
be,	1
after	1
all.	1
Anyhow,	1
it's	1
all	1
fixed	1
and	1
arranged	1
a'ready;	1
and	1
some	1
sailors	1
or	1
other	1
must	1
go	1
with	1
him,	1
I	1
suppose;	1
as	1
well	1
these	1
as	1
any	1
other	1
men,	1
God	1
pity	1
'em!	1
Morning	1
to	1
ye,	1
shipmates,	1
morning;	1
the	1
ineffable	1
heavens	1
bless	1
ye;	1
I'm	1
sorry	1
I	1
stopped	1
ye."	1
"Look	1
here,	1
friend,"	1
said	1
I,	1
"if	1
you	1
have	1
anything	1
important	1
to	1
tell	1
us,	1
out	1
with	1
it;	1
but	1
if	1
you	1
are	1
only	1
trying	1
to	1
bamboozle	1
us,	1
you	1
are	1
mistaken	1
in	1
your	1
game;	1
that's	1
all	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
say."	1
"And	1
it's	1
said	1
very	1
well,	1
and	1
I	1
like	1
to	1
hear	1
a	1
chap	1
talk	1
up	1
that	1
way;	1
you	1
are	1
just	1
the	1
man	1
for	1
him--the	1
likes	1
of	1
ye.	1
Morning	1
to	1
ye,	1
shipmates,	1
morning!	1
Oh!	1
when	1
ye	1
get	1
there,	1
tell	1
'em	1
I've	1
concluded	1
not	1
to	1
make	1
one	1
of	1
'em."	1
"Ah,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow,	1
you	1
can't	1
fool	1
us	1
that	1
way--you	1
can't	1
fool	1
us.	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
easiest	1
thing	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
for	1
a	1
man	1
to	1
look	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
great	1
secret	1
in	1
him."	1
"Morning	1
to	1
ye,	1
shipmates,	1
morning."	1
"Morning	1
it	1
is,"	1
said	1
I.	1
"Come	1
along,	1
Queequeg,	1
let's	1
leave	1
this	1
crazy	1
man.	1
But	1
stop,	1
tell	1
me	1
your	1
name,	1
will	1
you?"	1
"Elijah."	1
Elijah!	1
thought	1
I,	1
and	1
we	1
walked	1
away,	1
both	1
commenting,	1
after	1
each	1
other's	1
fashion,	1
upon	1
this	1
ragged	1
old	1
sailor;	1
and	1
agreed	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
nothing	1
but	1
a	1
humbug,	1
trying	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
bugbear.	1
But	1
we	1
had	1
not	1
gone	1
perhaps	1
above	1
a	1
hundred	1
yards,	1
when	1
chancing	1
to	1
turn	1
a	1
corner,	1
and	1
looking	1
back	1
as	1
I	1
did	1
so,	1
who	1
should	1
be	1
seen	1
but	1
Elijah	1
following	1
us,	1
though	1
at	1
a	1
distance.	1
Somehow,	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
him	1
struck	1
me	1
so,	1
that	1
I	1
said	1
nothing	1
to	1
Queequeg	1
of	1
his	1
being	1
behind,	1
but	1
passed	1
on	1
with	1
my	1
comrade,	1
anxious	1
to	1
see	1
whether	1
the	1
stranger	1
would	1
turn	1
the	1
same	1
corner	1
that	1
we	1
did.	1
He	1
did;	1
and	1
then	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
dogging	1
us,	1
but	1
with	1
what	1
intent	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
me	1
imagine.	1
This	1
circumstance,	1
coupled	1
with	1
his	1
ambiguous,	1
half-hinting,	1
half-revealing,	1
shrouded	1
sort	1
of	1
talk,	1
now	1
begat	1
in	1
me	1
all	1
kinds	1
of	1
vague	1
wonderments	1
and	1
half-apprehensions,	1
and	1
all	1
connected	1
with	1
the	1
Pequod;	1
and	1
Captain	1
Ahab;	1
and	1
the	1
leg	1
he	1
had	1
lost;	1
and	1
the	1
Cape	1
Horn	1
fit;	1
and	1
the	1
silver	1
calabash;	1
and	1
what	1
Captain	1
Peleg	1
had	1
said	1
of	1
him,	1
when	1
I	1
left	1
the	1
ship	1
the	1
day	1
previous;	1
and	1
the	1
prediction	1
of	1
the	1
squaw	1
Tistig;	1
and	1
the	1
voyage	1
we	1
had	1
bound	1
ourselves	1
to	1
sail;	1
and	1
a	1
hundred	1
other	1
shadowy	1
things.	1
I	1
was	1
resolved	1
to	1
satisfy	1
myself	1
whether	1
this	1
ragged	1
Elijah	1
was	1
really	1
dogging	1
us	1
or	1
not,	1
and	1
with	1
that	1
intent	1
crossed	1
the	1
way	1
with	1
Queequeg,	1
and	1
on	1
that	1
side	1
of	1
it	1
retraced	1
our	1
steps.	1
But	1
Elijah	1
passed	1
on,	1
without	1
seeming	1
to	1
notice	1
us.	1
This	1
relieved	1
me;	1
and	1
once	1
more,	1
and	1
finally	1
as	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
me,	1
I	1
pronounced	1
him	1
in	1
my	1
heart,	1
a	1
humbug.	1
CHAPTER	1
20	1
All	1
Astir.	1
A	1
day	1
or	1
two	1
passed,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
great	1
activity	1
aboard	1
the	1
Pequod.	1
Not	1
only	1
were	1
the	1
old	1
sails	1
being	1
mended,	1
but	1
new	1
sails	1
were	1
coming	1
on	1
board,	1
and	1
bolts	1
of	1
canvas,	1
and	1
coils	1
of	1
rigging;	1
in	1
short,	1
everything	1
betokened	1
that	1
the	1
ship's	1
preparations	1
were	1
hurrying	1
to	1
a	1
close.	1
Captain	1
Peleg	1
seldom	1
or	1
never	1
went	1
ashore,	1
but	1
sat	1
in	1
his	1
wigwam	1
keeping	1
a	1
sharp	1
look-out	1
upon	1
the	1
hands:	1
Bildad	1
did	1
all	1
the	1
purchasing	1
and	1
providing	1
at	1
the	1
stores;	1
and	1
the	1
men	1
employed	1
in	1
the	1
hold	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
rigging	1
were	1
working	1
till	1
long	1
after	1
night-fall.	1
On	1
the	1
day	1
following	1
Queequeg's	1
signing	1
the	1
articles,	1
word	1
was	1
given	1
at	1
all	1
the	1
inns	1
where	1
the	1
ship's	1
company	1
were	1
stopping,	1
that	1
their	1
chests	1
must	1
be	1
on	1
board	1
before	1
night,	1
for	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
telling	1
how	1
soon	1
the	1
vessel	1
might	1
be	1
sailing.	1
So	1
Queequeg	1
and	1
I	1
got	1
down	1
our	1
traps,	1
resolving,	1
however,	1
to	1
sleep	1
ashore	1
till	1
the	1
last.	1
But	1
it	1
seems	1
they	1
always	1
give	1
very	1
long	1
notice	1
in	1
these	1
cases,	1
and	1
the	1
ship	1
did	1
not	1
sail	1
for	1
several	1
days.	1
But	1
no	1
wonder;	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
to	1
be	1
done,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
telling	1
how	1
many	1
things	1
to	1
be	1
thought	1
of,	1
before	1
the	1
Pequod	1
was	1
fully	1
equipped.	1
Every	1
one	1
knows	1
what	1
a	1
multitude	1
of	1
things--beds,	1
sauce-pans,	1
knives	1
and	1
forks,	1
shovels	1
and	1
tongs,	1
napkins,	1
nut-crackers,	1
and	1
what	1
not,	1
are	1
indispensable	1
to	1
the	1
business	1
of	1
housekeeping.	1
Just	1
so	1
with	1
whaling,	1
which	1
necessitates	1
a	1
three-years'	1
housekeeping	1
upon	1
the	1
wide	1
ocean,	1
far	1
from	1
all	1
grocers,	1
costermongers,	1
doctors,	1
bakers,	1
and	1
bankers.	1
And	1
though	1
this	1
also	1
holds	1
true	1
of	1
merchant	1
vessels,	1
yet	1
not	1
by	1
any	1
means	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
extent	1
as	1
with	1
whalemen.	1
For	1
besides	1
the	1
great	1
length	1
of	1
the	1
whaling	1
voyage,	1
the	1
numerous	1
articles	1
peculiar	1
to	1
the	1
prosecution	1
of	1
the	1
fishery,	1
and	1
the	1
impossibility	1
of	1
replacing	1
them	1
at	1
the	1
remote	1
harbors	1
usually	1
frequented,	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
remembered,	1
that	1
of	1
all	1
ships,	1
whaling	1
vessels	1
are	1
the	1
most	1
exposed	1
to	1
accidents	1
of	1
all	1
kinds,	1
and	1
especially	1
to	1
the	1
destruction	1
and	1
loss	1
of	1
the	1
very	1
things	1
upon	1
which	1
the	1
success	1
of	1
the	1
voyage	1
most	1
depends.	1
Hence,	1
the	1
spare	1
boats,	1
spare	1
spars,	1
and	1
spare	1
lines	1
and	1
harpoons,	1
and	1
spare	1
everythings,	1
almost,	1
but	1
a	1
spare	1
Captain	1
and	1
duplicate	1
ship.	1
At	1
the	1
period	1
of	1
our	1
arrival	1
at	1
the	1
Island,	1
the	1
heaviest	1
storage	1
of	1
the	1
Pequod	1
had	1
been	1
almost	1
completed;	1
comprising	1
her	1
beef,	1
bread,	1
water,	1
fuel,	1
and	1
iron	1
hoops	1
and	1
staves.	1
But,	1
as	1
before	1
hinted,	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
continual	1
fetching	1
and	1
carrying	1
on	1
board	1
of	1
divers	1
odds	1
and	1
ends	1
of	1
things,	1
both	1
large	1
and	1
small.	1
Chief	1
among	1
those	1
who	1
did	1
this	1
fetching	1
and	1
carrying	1
was	1
Captain	1
Bildad's	1
sister,	1
a	1
lean	1
old	1
lady	1
of	1
a	1
most	1
determined	1
and	1
indefatigable	1
spirit,	1
but	1
withal	1
very	1
kindhearted,	1
who	1
seemed	1
resolved	1
that,	1
if	1
SHE	1
could	1
help	1
it,	1
nothing	1
should	1
be	1
found	1
wanting	1
in	1
the	1
Pequod,	1
after	1
once	1
fairly	1
getting	1
to	1
sea.	1
At	1
one	1
time	1
she	1
would	1
come	1
on	1
board	1
with	1
a	1
jar	1
of	1
pickles	1
for	1
the	1
steward's	1
pantry;	1
another	1
time	1
with	1
a	1
bunch	1
of	1
quills	1
for	1
the	1
chief	1
mate's	1
desk,	1
where	1
he	1
kept	1
his	1
log;	1
a	1
third	1
time	1
with	1
a	1
roll	1
of	1
flannel	1
for	1
the	1
small	1
of	1
some	1
one's	1
rheumatic	1
back.	1
Never	1
did	1
any	1
woman	1
better	1
deserve	1
her	1
name,	1
which	1
was	1
Charity--Aunt	1
Charity,	1
as	1
everybody	1
called	1
her.	1
And	1
like	1
a	1
sister	1
of	1
charity	1
did	1
this	1
charitable	1
Aunt	1
Charity	1
bustle	1
about	1
hither	1
and	1
thither,	1
ready	1
to	1
turn	1
her	1
hand	1
and	1
heart	1
to	1
anything	1
that	1
promised	1
to	1
yield	1
safety,	1
comfort,	1
and	1
consolation	1
to	1
all	1
on	1
board	1
a	1
ship	1
in	1
which	1
her	1
beloved	1
brother	1
Bildad	1
was	1
concerned,	1
and	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
herself	1
owned	1
a	1
score	1
or	1
two	1
of	1
well-saved	1
dollars.	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
startling	1
to	1
see	1
this	1
excellent	1
hearted	1
Quakeress	1
coming	1
on	1
board,	1
as	1
she	1
did	1
the	1
last	1
day,	1
with	1
a	1
long	1
oil-ladle	1
in	1
one	1
hand,	1
and	1
a	1
still	1
longer	1
whaling	1
lance	1
in	1
the	1
other.	1
Nor	1
was	1
Bildad	1
himself	1
nor	1
Captain	1
Peleg	1
at	1
all	1
backward.	1
As	1
for	1
Bildad,	1
he	1
carried	1
about	1
with	1
him	1
a	1
long	1
list	1
of	1
the	1
articles	1
needed,	1
and	1
at	1
every	1
fresh	1
arrival,	1
down	1
went	1
his	1
mark	1
opposite	1
that	1
article	1
upon	1
the	1
paper.	1
Every	1
once	1
in	1
a	1
while	1
Peleg	1
came	1
hobbling	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
whalebone	1
den,	1
roaring	1
at	1
the	1
men	1
down	1
the	1
hatchways,	1
roaring	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
riggers	1
at	1
the	1
mast-head,	1
and	1
then	1
concluded	1
by	1
roaring	1
back	1
into	1
his	1
wigwam.	1
During	1
these	1
days	1
of	1
preparation,	1
Queequeg	1
and	1
I	1
often	1
visited	1
the	1
craft,	1
and	1
as	1
often	1
I	1
asked	1
about	1
Captain	1
Ahab,	1
and	1
how	1
he	1
was,	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
come	1
on	1
board	1
his	1
ship.	1
To	1
these	1
questions	1
they	1
would	1
answer,	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
getting	1
better	1
and	1
better,	1
and	1
was	1
expected	1
aboard	1
every	1
day;	1
meantime,	1
the	1
two	1
captains,	1
Peleg	1
and	1
Bildad,	1
could	1
attend	1
to	1
everything	1
necessary	1
to	1
fit	1
the	1
vessel	1
for	1
the	1
voyage.	1
If	1
I	1
had	1
been	1
downright	1
honest	1
with	1
myself,	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
seen	1
very	1
plainly	1
in	1
my	1
heart	1
that	1
I	1
did	1
but	1
half	1
fancy	1
being	1
committed	1
this	1
way	1
to	1
so	1
long	1
a	1
voyage,	1
without	1
once	1
laying	1
my	1
eyes	1
on	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
absolute	1
dictator	1
of	1
it,	1
so	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
ship	1
sailed	1
out	1
upon	1
the	1
open	1
sea.	1
But	1
when	1
a	1
man	1
suspects	1
any	1
wrong,	1
it	1
sometimes	1
happens	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
be	1
already	1
involved	1
in	1
the	1
matter,	1
he	1
insensibly	1
strives	1
to	1
cover	1
up	1
his	1
suspicions	1
even	1
from	1
himself.	1
And	1
much	1
this	1
way	1
it	1
was	1
with	1
me.	1
I	1
said	1
nothing,	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
think	1
nothing.	1
At	1
last	1
it	1
was	1
given	1
out	1
that	1
some	1
time	1
next	1
day	1
the	1
ship	1
would	1
certainly	1
sail.	1
So	1
next	1
morning,	1
Queequeg	1
and	1
I	1
took	1
a	1
very	1
early	1
start.	1
CHAPTER	1
21	1
Going	1
Aboard.	1
It	1
was	1
nearly	1
six	1
o'clock,	1
but	1
only	1
grey	1
imperfect	1
misty	1
dawn,	1
when	1
we	1
drew	1
nigh	1
the	1
wharf.	1
"There	1
are	1
some	1
sailors	1
running	1
ahead	1
there,	1
if	1
I	1
see	1
right,"	1
said	1
I	1
to	1
Queequeg,	1
"it	1
can't	1
be	1
shadows;	1
she's	1
off	1
by	1
sunrise,	1
I	1
guess;	1
come	1
on!"	1
"Avast!"	1
cried	1
a	1
voice,	1
whose	1
owner	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
coming	1
close	1
behind	1
us,	1
laid	1
a	1
hand	1
upon	1
both	1
our	1
shoulders,	1
and	1
then	1
insinuating	1
himself	1
between	1
us,	1
stood	1
stooping	1
forward	1
a	1
little,	1
in	1
the	1
uncertain	1
twilight,	1
strangely	1
peering	1
from	1
Queequeg	1
to	1
me.	1
It	1
was	1
Elijah.	1
"Going	1
aboard?"	1
"Hands	1
off,	1
will	1
you,"	1
said	1
I.	1
"Lookee	1
here,"	1
said	1
Queequeg,	1
shaking	1
himself,	1
"go	1
'way!"	1
"Ain't	1
going	1
aboard,	1
then?"	1
"Yes,	1
we	1
are,"	1
said	1
I,	1
"but	1
what	1
business	1
is	1
that	1
of	1
yours?	1
Do	1
you	1
know,	1
Mr.	1
Elijah,	1
that	1
I	1
consider	1
you	1
a	1
little	1
impertinent?"	1
"No,	1
no,	1
no;	1
I	1
wasn't	1
aware	1
of	1
that,"	1
said	1
Elijah,	1
slowly	1
and	1
wonderingly	1
looking	1
from	1
me	1
to	1
Queequeg,	1
with	1
the	1
most	1
unaccountable	1
glances.	1
"Elijah,"	1
said	1
I,	1
"you	1
will	1
oblige	1
my	1
friend	1
and	1
me	1
by	1
withdrawing.	1
We	1
are	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
Indian	1
and	1
Pacific	1
Oceans,	1
and	1
would	1
prefer	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
detained."	1
"Ye	1
be,	1
be	1
ye?	1
Coming	1
back	1
afore	1
breakfast?"	1
"He's	1
cracked,	1
Queequeg,"	1
said	1
I,	1
"come	1
on."	1
"Holloa!"	1
cried	1
stationary	1
Elijah,	1
hailing	1
us	1
when	1
we	1
had	1
removed	1
a	1
few	1
paces.	1
"Never	1
mind	1
him,"	1
said	1
I,	1
"Queequeg,	1
come	1
on."	1
But	1
he	1
stole	1
up	1
to	1
us	1
again,	1
and	1
suddenly	1
clapping	1
his	1
hand	1
on	1
my	1
shoulder,	1
said--"Did	1
ye	1
see	1
anything	1
looking	1
like	1
men	1
going	1
towards	1
that	1
ship	1
a	1
while	1
ago?"	1
Struck	1
by	1
this	1
plain	1
matter-of-fact	1
question,	1
I	1
answered,	1
saying,	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
thought	1
I	1
did	1
see	1
four	1
or	1
five	1
men;	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
too	1
dim	1
to	1
be	1
sure."	1
"Very	1
dim,	1
very	1
dim,"	1
said	1
Elijah.	1
"Morning	1
to	1
ye."	1
Once	1
more	1
we	1
quitted	1
him;	1
but	1
once	1
more	1
he	1
came	1
softly	1
after	1
us;	1
and	1
touching	1
my	1
shoulder	1
again,	1
said,	1
"See	1
if	1
you	1
can	1
find	1
'em	1
now,	1
will	1
ye?	1
"Find	1
who?"	1
"Morning	1
to	1
ye!	1
morning	1
to	1
ye!"	1
he	1
rejoined,	1
again	1
moving	1
off.	1
"Oh!	1
I	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
warn	1
ye	1
against--but	1
never	1
mind,	1
never	1
mind--it's	1
all	1
one,	1
all	1
in	1
the	1
family	1
too;--sharp	1
frost	1
this	1
morning,	1
ain't	1
it?	1
Good-bye	1
to	1
ye.	1
Shan't	1
see	1
ye	1
again	1
very	1
soon,	1
I	1
guess;	1
unless	1
it's	1
before	1
the	1
Grand	1
Jury."	1
And	1
with	1
these	1
cracked	1
words	1
he	1
finally	1
departed,	1
leaving	1
me,	1
for	1
the	1
moment,	1
in	1
no	1
small	1
wonderment	1
at	1
his	1
frantic	1
impudence.	1
At	1
last,	1
stepping	1
on	1
board	1
the	1
Pequod,	1
we	1
found	1
everything	1
in	1
profound	1
quiet,	1
not	1
a	1
soul	1
moving.	1
The	1
cabin	1
entrance	1
was	1
locked	1
within;	1
the	1
hatches	1
were	1
all	1
on,	1
and	1
lumbered	1
with	1
coils	1
of	1
rigging.	1
Going	1
forward	1
to	1
the	1
forecastle,	1
we	1
found	1
the	1
slide	1
of	1
the	1
scuttle	1
open.	1
Seeing	1
a	1
light,	1
we	1
went	1
down,	1
and	1
found	1
only	1
an	1
old	1
rigger	1
there,	1
wrapped	1
in	1
a	1
tattered	1
pea-jacket.	1
He	1
was	1
thrown	1
at	1
whole	1
length	1
upon	1
two	1
chests,	1
his	1
face	1
downwards	1
and	1
inclosed	1
in	1
his	1
folded	1
arms.	1
The	1
profoundest	1
slumber	1
slept	1
upon	1
him.	1
"Those	1
sailors	1
we	1
saw,	1
Queequeg,	1
where	1
can	1
they	1
have	1
gone	1
to?"	1
said	1
I,	1
looking	1
dubiously	1
at	1
the	1
sleeper.	1
But	1
it	1
seemed	1
that,	1
when	1
on	1
the	1
wharf,	1
Queequeg	1
had	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
noticed	1
what	1
I	1
now	1
alluded	1
to;	1
hence	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
thought	1
myself	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
optically	1
deceived	1
in	1
that	1
matter,	1
were	1
it	1
not	1
for	1
Elijah's	1
otherwise	1
inexplicable	1
question.	1
But	1
I	1
beat	1
the	1
thing	1
down;	1
and	1
again	1
marking	1
the	1
sleeper,	1
jocularly	1
hinted	1
to	1
Queequeg	1
that	1
perhaps	1
we	1
had	1
best	1
sit	1
up	1
with	1
the	1
body;	1
telling	1
him	1
to	1
establish	1
himself	1
accordingly.	1
He	1
put	1
his	1
hand	1
upon	1
the	1
sleeper's	1
rear,	1
as	1
though	1
feeling	1
if	1
it	1
was	1
soft	1
enough;	1
and	1
then,	1
without	1
more	1
ado,	1
sat	1
quietly	1
down	1
there.	1
"Gracious!	1
Queequeg,	1
don't	1
sit	1
there,"	1
said	1
I.	1
"Oh!	1
perry	1
dood	1
seat,"	1
said	1
Queequeg,	1
"my	1
country	1
way;	1
won't	1
hurt	1
him	1
face."	1
"Face!"	1
said	1
I,	1
"call	1
that	1
his	1
face?	1
very	1
benevolent	1
countenance	1
then;	1
but	1
how	1
hard	1
he	1
breathes,	1
he's	1
heaving	1
himself;	1
get	1
off,	1
Queequeg,	1
you	1
are	1
heavy,	1
it's	1
grinding	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
poor.	1
Get	1
off,	1
Queequeg!	1
Look,	1
he'll	1
twitch	1
you	1
off	1
soon.	1
I	1
wonder	1
he	1
don't	1
wake."	1
Queequeg	1
removed	1
himself	1
to	1
just	1
beyond	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
sleeper,	1
and	1
lighted	1
his	1
tomahawk	1
pipe.	1
I	1
sat	1
at	1
the	1
feet.	1
We	1
kept	1
the	1
pipe	1
passing	1
over	1
the	1
sleeper,	1
from	1
one	1
to	1
the	1
other.	1
Meanwhile,	1
upon	1
questioning	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
broken	1
fashion,	1
Queequeg	1
gave	1
me	1
to	1
understand	1
that,	1
in	1
his	1
land,	1
owing	1
to	1
the	1
absence	1
of	1
settees	1
and	1
sofas	1
of	1
all	1
sorts,	1
the	1
king,	1
chiefs,	1
and	1
great	1
people	1
generally,	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
custom	1
of	1
fattening	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
lower	1
orders	1
for	1
ottomans;	1
and	1
to	1
furnish	1
a	1
house	1
comfortably	1
in	1
that	1
respect,	1
you	1
had	1
only	1
to	1
buy	1
up	1
eight	1
or	1
ten	1
lazy	1
fellows,	1
and	1
lay	1
them	1
round	1
in	1
the	1
piers	1
and	1
alcoves.	1
Besides,	1
it	1
was	1
very	1
convenient	1
on	1
an	1
excursion;	1
much	1
better	1
than	1
those	1
garden-chairs	1
which	1
are	1
convertible	1
into	1
walking-sticks;	1
upon	1
occasion,	1
a	1
chief	1
calling	1
his	1
attendant,	1
and	1
desiring	1
him	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
settee	1
of	1
himself	1
under	1
a	1
spreading	1
tree,	1
perhaps	1
in	1
some	1
damp	1
marshy	1
place.	1
While	1
narrating	1
these	1
things,	1
every	1
time	1
Queequeg	1
received	1
the	1
tomahawk	1
from	1
me,	1
he	1
flourished	1
the	1
hatchet-side	1
of	1
it	1
over	1
the	1
sleeper's	1
head.	1
"What's	1
that	1
for,	1
Queequeg?"	1
"Perry	1
easy,	1
kill-e;	1
oh!	1
perry	1
easy!	1
He	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
with	1
some	1
wild	1
reminiscences	1
about	1
his	1
tomahawk-pipe,	1
which,	1
it	1
seemed,	1
had	1
in	1
its	1
two	1
uses	1
both	1
brained	1
his	1
foes	1
and	1
soothed	1
his	1
soul,	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
directly	1
attracted	1
to	1
the	1
sleeping	1
rigger.	1
The	1
strong	1
vapour	1
now	1
completely	1
filling	1
the	1
contracted	1
hole,	1
it	1
began	1
to	1
tell	1
upon	1
him.	1
He	1
breathed	1
with	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
muffledness;	1
then	1
seemed	1
troubled	1
in	1
the	1
nose;	1
then	1
revolved	1
over	1
once	1
or	1
twice;	1
then	1
sat	1
up	1
and	1
rubbed	1
his	1
eyes.	1
"Holloa!"	1
he	1
breathed	1
at	1
last,	1
"who	1
be	1
ye	1
smokers?"	1
"Shipped	1
men,"	1
answered	1
I,	1
"when	1
does	1
she	1
sail?"	1
"Aye,	1
aye,	1
ye	1
are	1
going	1
in	1
her,	1
be	1
ye?	1
She	1
sails	1
to-day.	1
The	1
Captain	1
came	1
aboard	1
last	1
night."	1
"What	1
Captain?--Ahab?"	1
"Who	1
but	1
him	1
indeed?"	1
I	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
ask	1
him	1
some	1
further	1
questions	1
concerning	1
Ahab,	1
when	1
we	1
heard	1
a	1
noise	1
on	1
deck.	1
"Holloa!	1
Starbuck's	1
astir,"	1
said	1
the	1
rigger.	1
"He's	1
a	1
lively	1
chief	1
mate,	1
that;	1
good	1
man,	1
and	1
a	1
pious;	1
but	1
all	1
alive	1
now,	1
I	1
must	1
turn	1
to."	1
And	1
so	1
saying	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
deck,	1
and	1
we	1
followed.	1
It	1
was	1
now	1
clear	1
sunrise.	1
Soon	1
the	1
crew	1
came	1
on	1
board	1
in	1
twos	1
and	1
threes;	1
the	1
riggers	1
bestirred	1
themselves;	1
the	1
mates	1
were	1
actively	1
engaged;	1
and	1
several	1
of	1
the	1
shore	1
people	1
were	1
busy	1
in	1
bringing	1
various	1
last	1
things	1
on	1
board.	1
Meanwhile	1
Captain	1
Ahab	1
remained	1
invisibly	1
enshrined	1
within	1
his	1
cabin.	1
CHAPTER	1
22	1
Merry	1
Christmas.	1
At	1
length,	1
towards	1
noon,	1
upon	1
the	1
final	1
dismissal	1
of	1
the	1
ship's	1
riggers,	1
and	1
after	1
the	1
Pequod	1
had	1
been	1
hauled	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
wharf,	1
and	1
after	1
the	1
ever-thoughtful	1
Charity	1
had	1
come	1
off	1
in	1
a	1
whale-boat,	1
with	1
her	1
last	1
gift--a	1
night-cap	1
for	1
Stubb,	1
the	1
second	1
mate,	1
her	1
brother-in-law,	1
and	1
a	1
spare	1
Bible	1
for	1
the	1
steward--after	1
all	1
this,	1
the	1
two	1
Captains,	1
Peleg	1
and	1
Bildad,	1
issued	1
from	1
the	1
cabin,	1
and	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
chief	1
mate,	1
Peleg	1
said:	1
"Now,	1
Mr.	1
Starbuck,	1
are	1
you	1
sure	1
everything	1
is	1
right?	1
Captain	1
Ahab	1
is	1
all	1
ready--just	1
spoke	1
to	1
him--nothing	1
more	1
to	1
be	1
got	1
from	1
shore,	1
eh?	1
Well,	1
call	1
all	1
hands,	1
then.	1
Muster	1
'em	1
aft	1
here--blast	1
'em!"	1
"No	1
need	1
of	1
profane	1
words,	1
however	1
great	1
the	1
hurry,	1
Peleg,"	1
said	1
Bildad,	1
"but	1
away	1
with	1
thee,	1
friend	1
Starbuck,	1
and	1
do	1
our	1
bidding."	1
How	1
now!	1
Here	1
upon	1
the	1
very	1
point	1
of	1
starting	1
for	1
the	1
voyage,	1
Captain	1
Peleg	1
and	1
Captain	1
Bildad	1
were	1
going	1
it	1
with	1
a	1
high	1
hand	1
on	1
the	1
quarter-deck,	1
just	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
joint-commanders	1
at	1
sea,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
to	1
all	1
appearances	1
in	1
port.	1
And,	1
as	1
for	1
Captain	1
Ahab,	1
no	1
sign	1
of	1
him	1
was	1
yet	1
to	1
be	1
seen;	1
only,	1
they	1
said	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
cabin.	1
But	1
then,	1
the	1
idea	1
was,	1
that	1
his	1
presence	1
was	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
necessary	1
in	1
getting	1
the	1
ship	1
under	1
weigh,	1
and	1
steering	1
her	1
well	1
out	1
to	1
sea.	1
Indeed,	1
as	1
that	1
was	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
his	1
proper	1
business,	1
but	1
the	1
pilot's;	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
yet	1
completely	1
recovered--so	1
they	1
said--therefore,	1
Captain	1
Ahab	1
stayed	1
below.	1
And	1
all	1
this	1
seemed	1
natural	1
enough;	1
especially	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
merchant	1
service	1
many	1
captains	1
never	1
show	1
themselves	1
on	1
deck	1
for	1
a	1
considerable	1
time	1
after	1
heaving	1
up	1
the	1
anchor,	1
but	1
remain	1
over	1
the	1
cabin	1
table,	1
having	1
a	1
farewell	1
merry-making	1
with	1
their	1
shore	1
friends,	1
before	1
they	1
quit	1
the	1
ship	1
for	1
good	1
with	1
the	1
pilot.	1
But	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
much	1
chance	1
to	1
think	1
over	1
the	1
matter,	1
for	1
Captain	1
Peleg	1
was	1
now	1
all	1
alive.	1
He	1
seemed	1
to	1
do	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
talking	1
and	1
commanding,	1
and	1
not	1
Bildad.	1
"Aft	1
here,	1
ye	1
sons	1
of	1
bachelors,"	1
he	1
cried,	1
as	1
the	1
sailors	1
lingered	1
at	1
the	1
main-mast.	1
"Mr.	1
Starbuck,	1
drive'em	1
aft."	1
"Strike	1
the	1
tent	1
there!"--was	1
the	1
next	1
order.	1
As	1
I	1
hinted	1
before,	1
this	1
whalebone	1
marquee	1
was	1
never	1
pitched	1
except	1
in	1
port;	1
and	1
on	1
board	1
the	1
Pequod,	1
for	1
thirty	1
years,	1
the	1
order	1
to	1
strike	1
the	1
tent	1
was	1
well	1
known	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
next	1
thing	1
to	1
heaving	1
up	1
the	1
anchor.	1
"Man	1
the	1
capstan!	1
Blood	1
and	1
thunder!--jump!"--was	1
the	1
next	1
command,	1
and	1
the	1
crew	1
sprang	1
for	1
the	1
handspikes.	1
Now	1
in	1
getting	1
under	1
weigh,	1
the	1
station	1
generally	1
occupied	1
by	1
the	1
pilot	1
is	1
the	1
forward	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
ship.	1
And	1
here	1
Bildad,	1
who,	1
with	1
Peleg,	1
be	1
it	1
known,	1
in	1
addition	1
to	1
his	1
other	1
officers,	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
licensed	1
pilots	1
of	1
the	1
port--he	1
being	1
suspected	1
to	1
have	1
got	1
himself	1
made	1
a	1
pilot	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
save	1
the	1
Nantucket	1
pilot-fee	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
ships	1
he	1
was	1
concerned	1
in,	1
for	1
he	1
never	1
piloted	1
any	1
other	1
craft--Bildad,	1
I	1
say,	1
might	1
now	1
be	1
seen	1
actively	1
engaged	1
in	1
looking	1
over	1
the	1
bows	1
for	1
the	1
approaching	1
anchor,	1
and	1
at	1
intervals	1
singing	1
what	1
seemed	1
a	1
dismal	1
stave	1
of	1
psalmody,	1
to	1
cheer	1
the	1
hands	1
at	1
the	1
windlass,	1
who	1
roared	1
forth	1
some	1
sort	1
of	1
a	1
chorus	1
about	1
the	1
girls	1
in	1
Booble	1
Alley,	1
with	1
hearty	1
good	1
will.	1
Nevertheless,	1
not	1
three	1
days	1
previous,	1
Bildad	1
had	1
told	1
them	1
that	1
no	1
profane	1
songs	1
would	1
be	1
allowed	1
on	1
board	1
the	1
Pequod,	1
particularly	1
in	1
getting	1
under	1
weigh;	1
and	1
Charity,	1
his	1
sister,	1
had	1
placed	1
a	1
small	1
choice	1
copy	1
of	1
Watts	1
in	1
each	1
seaman's	1
berth.	1
Meantime,	1
overseeing	1
the	1
other	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
ship,	1
Captain	1
Peleg	1
ripped	1
and	1
swore	1
astern	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
frightful	1
manner.	1
I	1
almost	1
thought	1
he	1
would	1
sink	1
the	1
ship	1
before	1
the	1
anchor	1
could	1
be	1
got	1
up;	1
involuntarily	1
I	1
paused	1
on	1
my	1
handspike,	1
and	1
told	1
Queequeg	1
to	1
do	1
the	1
same,	1
thinking	1
of	1
the	1
perils	1
we	1
both	1
ran,	1
in	1
starting	1
on	1
the	1
voyage	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
devil	1
for	1
a	1
pilot.	1
I	1
was	1
comforting	1
myself,	1
however,	1
with	1
the	1
thought	1
that	1
in	1
pious	1
Bildad	1
might	1
be	1
found	1
some	1
salvation,	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
seven	1
hundred	1
and	1
seventy-seventh	1
lay;	1
when	1
I	1
felt	1
a	1
sudden	1
sharp	1
poke	1
in	1
my	1
rear,	1
and	1
turning	1
round,	1
was	1
horrified	1
at	1
the	1
apparition	1
of	1
Captain	1
Peleg	1
in	1
the	1
act	1
of	1
withdrawing	1
his	1
leg	1
from	1
my	1
immediate	1
vicinity.	1
That	1
was	1
my	1
first	1
kick.	1
"Is	1
that	1
the	1
way	1
they	1
heave	1
in	1
the	1
marchant	1
service?"	1
he	1
roared.	1
"Spring,	1
thou	1
sheep-head;	1
spring,	1
and	1
break	1
thy	1
backbone!	1
Why	1
don't	1
ye	1
spring,	1
I	1
say,	1
all	1
of	1
ye--spring!	1
Quohog!	1
spring,	1
thou	1
chap	1
with	1
the	1
red	1
whiskers;	1
spring	1
there,	1
Scotch-cap;	1
spring,	1
thou	1
green	1
pants.	1
Spring,	1
I	1
say,	1
all	1
of	1
ye,	1
and	1
spring	1
your	1
eyes	1
out!"	1
And	1
so	1
saying,	1
he	1
moved	1
along	1
the	1
windlass,	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
using	1
his	1
leg	1
very	1
freely,	1
while	1
imperturbable	1
Bildad	1
kept	1
leading	1
off	1
with	1
his	1
psalmody.	1
Thinks	1
I,	1
Captain	1
Peleg	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
drinking	1
something	1
to-day.	1
At	1
last	1
the	1
anchor	1
was	1
up,	1
the	1
sails	1
were	1
set,	1
and	1
off	1
we	1
glided.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
short,	1
cold	1
Christmas;	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
short	1
northern	1
day	1
merged	1
into	1
night,	1
we	1
found	1
ourselves	1
almost	1
broad	1
upon	1
the	1
wintry	1
ocean,	1
whose	1
freezing	1
spray	1
cased	1
us	1
in	1
ice,	1
as	1
in	1
polished	1
armor.	1
The	1
long	1
rows	1
of	1
teeth	1
on	1
the	1
bulwarks	1
glistened	1
in	1
the	1
moonlight;	1
and	1
like	1
the	1
white	1
ivory	1
tusks	1
of	1
some	1
huge	1
elephant,	1
vast	1
curving	1
icicles	1
depended	1
from	1
the	1
bows.	1
Lank	1
Bildad,	1
as	1
pilot,	1
headed	1
the	1
first	1
watch,	1
and	1
ever	1
and	1
anon,	1
as	1
the	1
old	1
craft	1
deep	1
dived	1
into	1
the	1
green	1
seas,	1
and	1
sent	1
the	1
shivering	1
frost	1
all	1
over	1
her,	1
and	1
the	1
winds	1
howled,	1
and	1
the	1
cordage	1
rang,	1
his	1
steady	1
notes	1
were	1
heard,--	1
"Sweet	1
fields	1
beyond	1
the	1
swelling	1
flood,	1
Stand	1
dressed	1
in	1
living	1
green.	1
So	1
to	1
the	1
Jews	1
old	1
Canaan	1
stood,	1
While	1
Jordan	1
rolled	1
between."	1
Never	1
did	1
those	1
sweet	1
words	1
sound	1
more	1
sweetly	1
to	1
me	1
than	1
then.	1
They	1
were	1
full	1
of	1
hope	1
and	1
fruition.	1
Spite	1
of	1
this	1
frigid	1
winter	1
night	1
in	1
the	1
boisterous	1
Atlantic,	1
spite	1
of	1
my	1
wet	1
feet	1
and	1
wetter	1
jacket,	1
there	1
was	1
yet,	1
it	1
then	1
seemed	1
to	1
me,	1
many	1
a	1
pleasant	1
haven	1
in	1
store;	1
and	1
meads	1
and	1
glades	1
so	1
eternally	1
vernal,	1
that	1
the	1
grass	1
shot	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
spring,	1
untrodden,	1
unwilted,	1
remains	1
at	1
midsummer.	1
At	1
last	1
we	1
gained	1
such	1
an	1
offing,	1
that	1
the	1
two	1
pilots	1
were	1
needed	1
no	1
longer.	1
The	1
stout	1
sail-boat	1
that	1
had	1
accompanied	1
us	1
began	1
ranging	1
alongside.	1
It	1
was	1
curious	1
and	1
not	1
unpleasing,	1
how	1
Peleg	1
and	1
Bildad	1
were	1
affected	1
at	1
this	1
juncture,	1
especially	1
Captain	1
Bildad.	1
For	1
loath	1
to	1
depart,	1
yet;	1
very	1
loath	1
to	1
leave,	1
for	1
good,	1
a	1
ship	1
bound	1
on	1
so	1
long	1
and	1
perilous	1
a	1
voyage--beyond	1
both	1
stormy	1
Capes;	1
a	1
ship	1
in	1
which	1
some	1
thousands	1
of	1
his	1
hard	1
earned	1
dollars	1
were	1
invested;	1
a	1
ship,	1
in	1
which	1
an	1
old	1
shipmate	1
sailed	1
as	1
captain;	1
a	1
man	1
almost	1
as	1
old	1
as	1
he,	1
once	1
more	1
starting	1
to	1
encounter	1
all	1
the	1
terrors	1
of	1
the	1
pitiless	1
jaw;	1
loath	1
to	1
say	1
good-bye	1
to	1
a	1
thing	1
so	1
every	1
way	1
brimful	1
of	1
every	1
interest	1
to	1
him,--poor	1
old	1
Bildad	1
lingered	1
long;	1
paced	1
the	1
deck	1
with	1
anxious	1
strides;	1
ran	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
cabin	1
to	1
speak	1
another	1
farewell	1
word	1
there;	1
again	1
came	1
on	1
deck,	1
and	1
looked	1
to	1
windward;	1
looked	1
towards	1
the	1
wide	1
and	1
endless	1
waters,	1
only	1
bounded	1
by	1
the	1
far-off	1
unseen	1
Eastern	1
Continents;	1
looked	1
towards	1
the	1
land;	1
looked	1
aloft;	1
looked	1
right	1
and	1
left;	1
looked	1
everywhere	1
and	1
nowhere;	1
and	1
at	1
last,	1
mechanically	1
coiling	1
a	1
rope	1
upon	1
its	1
pin,	1
convulsively	1
grasped	1
stout	1
Peleg	1
by	1
the	1
hand,	1
and	1
holding	1
up	1
a	1
lantern,	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
stood	1
gazing	1
heroically	1
in	1
his	1
face,	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
to	1
say,	1
"Nevertheless,	1
friend	1
Peleg,	1
I	1
can	1
stand	1
it;	1
yes,	1
I	1
can."	1
As	1
for	1
Peleg	1
himself,	1
he	1
took	1
it	1
more	1
like	1
a	1
philosopher;	1
but	1
for	1
all	1
his	1
philosophy,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
tear	1
twinkling	1
in	1
his	1
eye,	1
when	1
the	1
lantern	1
came	1
too	1
near.	1
And	1
he,	1
too,	1
did	1
not	1
a	1
little	1
run	1
from	1
cabin	1
to	1
deck--now	1
a	1
word	1
below,	1
and	1
now	1
a	1
word	1
with	1
Starbuck,	1
the	1
chief	1
mate.	1
But,	1
at	1
last,	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
his	1
comrade,	1
with	1
a	1
final	1
sort	1
of	1
look	1
about	1
him,--"Captain	1
Bildad--come,	1
old	1
shipmate,	1
we	1
must	1
go.	1
Back	1
the	1
main-yard	1
there!	1
Boat	1
ahoy!	1
Stand	1
by	1
to	1
come	1
close	1
alongside,	1
now!	1
Careful,	1
careful!--come,	1
Bildad,	1
boy--say	1
your	1
last.	1
Luck	1
to	1
ye,	1
Starbuck--luck	1
to	1
ye,	1
Mr.	1
Stubb--luck	1
to	1
ye,	1
Mr.	1
Flask--good-bye	1
and	1
good	1
luck	1
to	1
ye	1
all--and	1
this	1
day	1
three	1
years	1
I'll	1
have	1
a	1
hot	1
supper	1
smoking	1
for	1
ye	1
in	1
old	1
Nantucket.	1
Hurrah	1
and	1
away!"	1
"God	1
bless	1
ye,	1
and	1
have	1
ye	1
in	1
His	1
holy	1
keeping,	1
men,"	1
murmured	1
old	1
Bildad,	1
almost	1
incoherently.	1
"I	1
hope	1
ye'll	1
have	1
fine	1
weather	1
now,	1
so	1
that	1
Captain	1
Ahab	1
may	1
soon	1
be	1
moving	1
among	1
ye--a	1
pleasant	1
sun	1
is	1
all	1
he	1
needs,	1
and	1
ye'll	1
have	1
plenty	1
of	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
tropic	1
voyage	1
ye	1
go.	1
Be	1
careful	1
in	1
the	1
hunt,	1
ye	1
mates.	1
Don't	1
stave	1
the	1
boats	1
needlessly,	1
ye	1
harpooneers;	1
good	1
white	1
cedar	1
plank	1
is	1
raised	1
full	1
three	1
per	1
cent.	1
within	1
the	1
year.	1
Don't	1
forget	1
your	1
prayers,	1
either.	1
Mr.	1
Starbuck,	1
mind	1
that	1
cooper	1
don't	1
waste	1
the	1
spare	1
staves.	1
Oh!	1
the	1
sail-needles	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
green	1
locker!	1
Don't	1
whale	1
it	1
too	1
much	1
a'	1
Lord's	1
days,	1
men;	1
but	1
don't	1
miss	1
a	1
fair	1
chance	1
either,	1
that's	1
rejecting	1
Heaven's	1
good	1
gifts.	1
Have	1
an	1
eye	1
to	1
the	1
molasses	1
tierce,	1
Mr.	1
Stubb;	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
leaky,	1
I	1
thought.	1
If	1
ye	1
touch	1
at	1
the	1
islands,	1
Mr.	1
Flask,	1
beware	1
of	1
fornication.	1
Good-bye,	1
good-bye!	1
Don't	1
keep	1
that	1
cheese	1
too	1
long	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
hold,	1
Mr.	1
Starbuck;	1
it'll	1
spoil.	1
Be	1
careful	1
with	1
the	1
butter--twenty	1
cents	1
the	1
pound	1
it	1
was,	1
and	1
mind	1
ye,	1
if--"	1
"Come,	1
come,	1
Captain	1
Bildad;	1
stop	1
palavering,--away!"	1
and	1
with	1
that,	1
Peleg	1
hurried	1
him	1
over	1
the	1
side,	1
and	1
both	1
dropt	1
into	1
the	1
boat.	1
Ship	1
and	1
boat	1
diverged;	1
the	1
cold,	1
damp	1
night	1
breeze	1
blew	1
between;	1
a	1
screaming	1
gull	1
flew	1
overhead;	1
the	1
two	1
hulls	1
wildly	1
rolled;	1
we	1
gave	1
three	1
heavy-hearted	1
cheers,	1
and	1
blindly	1
plunged	1
like	1
fate	1
into	1
the	1
lone	1
Atlantic.	1
CHAPTER	1
23	1
The	1
Lee	1
Shore.	1
Some	1
chapters	1
back,	1
one	1
Bulkington	1
was	1
spoken	1
of,	1
a	1
tall,	1
newlanded	1
mariner,	1
encountered	1
in	1
New	1
Bedford	1
at	1
the	1
inn.	1
When	1
on	1
that	1
shivering	1
winter's	1
night,	1
the	1
Pequod	1
thrust	1
her	1
vindictive	1
bows	1
into	1
the	1
cold	1
malicious	1
waves,	1
who	1
should	1
I	1
see	1
standing	1
at	1
her	1
helm	1
but	1
Bulkington!	1
I	1
looked	1
with	1
sympathetic	1
awe	1
and	1
fearfulness	1
upon	1
the	1
man,	1
who	1
in	1
mid-winter	1
just	1
landed	1
from	1
a	1
four	1
years'	1
dangerous	1
voyage,	1
could	1
so	1
unrestingly	1
push	1
off	1
again	1
for	1
still	1
another	1
tempestuous	1
term.	1
The	1
land	1
seemed	1
scorching	1
to	1
his	1
feet.	1
Wonderfullest	1
things	1
are	1
ever	1
the	1
unmentionable;	1
deep	1
memories	1
yield	1
no	1
epitaphs;	1
this	1
six-inch	1
chapter	1
is	1
the	1
stoneless	1
grave	1
of	1
Bulkington.	1
Let	1
me	1
only	1
say	1
that	1
it	1
fared	1
with	1
him	1
as	1
with	1
the	1
storm-tossed	1
ship,	1
that	1
miserably	1
drives	1
along	1
the	1
leeward	1
land.	1
The	1
port	1
would	1
fain	1
give	1
succor;	1
the	1
port	1
is	1
pitiful;	1
in	1
the	1
port	1
is	1
safety,	1
comfort,	1
hearthstone,	1
supper,	1
warm	1
blankets,	1
friends,	1
all	1
that's	1
kind	1
to	1
our	1
mortalities.	1
But	1
in	1
that	1
gale,	1
the	1
port,	1
the	1
land,	1
is	1
that	1
ship's	1
direst	1
jeopardy;	1
she	1
must	1
fly	1
all	1
hospitality;	1
one	1
touch	1
of	1
land,	1
though	1
it	1
but	1
graze	1
the	1
keel,	1
would	1
make	1
her	1
shudder	1
through	1
and	1
through.	1
With	1
all	1
her	1
might	1
she	1
crowds	1
all	1
sail	1
off	1
shore;	1
in	1
so	1
doing,	1
fights	1
'gainst	1
the	1
very	1
winds	1
that	1
fain	1
would	1
blow	1
her	1
homeward;	1
seeks	1
all	1
the	1
lashed	1
sea's	1
landlessness	1
again;	1
for	1
refuge's	1
sake	1
forlornly	1
rushing	1
into	1
peril;	1
her	1
only	1
friend	1
her	1
bitterest	1
foe!	1
Know	1
ye	1
now,	1
Bulkington?	1
Glimpses	1
do	1
ye	1
seem	1
to	1
see	1
of	1
that	1
mortally	1
intolerable	1
truth;	1
that	1
all	1
deep,	1
earnest	1
thinking	1
is	1
but	1
the	1
intrepid	1
effort	1
of	1
the	1
soul	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
open	1
independence	1
of	1
her	1
sea;	1
while	1
the	1
wildest	1
winds	1
of	1
heaven	1
and	1
earth	1
conspire	1
to	1
cast	1
her	1
on	1
the	1
treacherous,	1
slavish	1
shore?	1
But	1
as	1
in	1
landlessness	1
alone	1
resides	1
highest	1
truth,	1
shoreless,	1
indefinite	1
as	1
God--so,	1
better	1
is	1
it	1
to	1
perish	1
in	1
that	1
howling	1
infinite,	1
than	1
be	1
ingloriously	1
dashed	1
upon	1
the	1
lee,	1
even	1
if	1
that	1
were	1
safety!	1
For	1
worm-like,	1
then,	1
oh!	1
who	1
would	1
craven	1
crawl	1
to	1
land!	1
Terrors	1
of	1
the	1
terrible!	1
is	1
all	1
this	1
agony	1
so	1
vain?	1
Take	1
heart,	1
take	1
heart,	1
O	1
Bulkington!	1
Bear	1
thee	1
grimly,	1
demigod!	1
Up	1
from	1
the	1
spray	1
of	1
thy	1
ocean-perishing--straight	1
up,	1
leaps	1
thy	1
apotheosis!	1
CHAPTER	1
24	1
The	1
Advocate.	1
As	1
Queequeg	1
and	1
I	1
are	1
now	1
fairly	1
embarked	1
in	1
this	1
business	1
of	1
whaling;	1
and	1
as	1
this	1
business	1
of	1
whaling	1
has	1
somehow	1
come	1
to	1
be	1
regarded	1
among	1
landsmen	1
as	1
a	1
rather	1
unpoetical	1
and	1
disreputable	1
pursuit;	1
therefore,	1
I	1
am	1
all	1
anxiety	1
to	1
convince	1
ye,	1
ye	1
landsmen,	1
of	1
the	1
injustice	1
hereby	1
done	1
to	1
us	1
hunters	1
of	1
whales.	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
place,	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
deemed	1
almost	1
superfluous	1
to	1
establish	1
the	1
fact,	1
that	1
among	1
people	1
at	1
large,	1
the	1
business	1
of	1
whaling	1
is	1
not	1
accounted	1
on	1
a	1
level	1
with	1
what	1
are	1
called	1
the	1
liberal	1
professions.	1
If	1
a	1
stranger	1
were	1
introduced	1
into	1
any	1
miscellaneous	1
metropolitan	1
society,	1
it	1
would	1
but	1
slightly	1
advance	1
the	1
general	1
opinion	1
of	1
his	1
merits,	1
were	1
he	1
presented	1
to	1
the	1
company	1
as	1
a	1
harpooneer,	1
say;	1
and	1
if	1
in	1
emulation	1
of	1
the	1
naval	1
officers	1
he	1
should	1
append	1
the	1
initials	1
S.W.F.	1
(Sperm	1
Whale	1
Fishery)	1
to	1
his	1
visiting	1
card,	1
such	1
a	1
procedure	1
would	1
be	1
deemed	1
pre-eminently	1
presuming	1
and	1
ridiculous.	1
Doubtless	1
one	1
leading	1
reason	1
why	1
the	1
world	1
declines	1
honouring	1
us	1
whalemen,	1
is	1
this:	1
they	1
think	1
that,	1
at	1
best,	1
our	1
vocation	1
amounts	1
to	1
a	1
butchering	1
sort	1
of	1
business;	1
and	1
that	1
when	1
actively	1
engaged	1
therein,	1
we	1
are	1
surrounded	1
by	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
defilements.	1
Butchers	1
we	1
are,	1
that	1
is	1
true.	1
But	1
butchers,	1
also,	1
and	1
butchers	1
of	1
the	1
bloodiest	1
badge	1
have	1
been	1
all	1
Martial	1
Commanders	1
whom	1
the	1
world	1
invariably	1
delights	1
to	1
honour.	1
And	1
as	1
for	1
the	1
matter	1
of	1
the	1
alleged	1
uncleanliness	1
of	1
our	1
business,	1
ye	1
shall	1
soon	1
be	1
initiated	1
into	1
certain	1
facts	1
hitherto	1
pretty	1
generally	1
unknown,	1
and	1
which,	1
upon	1
the	1
whole,	1
will	1
triumphantly	1
plant	1
the	1
sperm	1
whale-ship	1
at	1
least	1
among	1
the	1
cleanliest	1
things	1
of	1
this	1
tidy	1
earth.	1
But	1
even	1
granting	1
the	1
charge	1
in	1
question	1
to	1
be	1
true;	1
what	1
disordered	1
slippery	1
decks	1
of	1
a	1
whale-ship	1
are	1
comparable	1
to	1
the	1
unspeakable	1
carrion	1
of	1
those	1
battle-fields	1
from	1
which	1
so	1
many	1
soldiers	1
return	1
to	1
drink	1
in	1
all	1
ladies'	1
plaudits?	1
And	1
if	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
peril	1
so	1
much	1
enhances	1
the	1
popular	1
conceit	1
of	1
the	1
soldier's	1
profession;	1
let	1
me	1
assure	1
ye	1
that	1
many	1
a	1
veteran	1
who	1
has	1
freely	1
marched	1
up	1
to	1
a	1
battery,	1
would	1
quickly	1
recoil	1
at	1
the	1
apparition	1
of	1
the	1
sperm	1
whale's	1
vast	1
tail,	1
fanning	1
into	1
eddies	1
the	1
air	1
over	1
his	1
head.	1
For	1
what	1
are	1
the	1
comprehensible	1
terrors	1
of	1
man	1
compared	1
with	1
the	1
interlinked	1
terrors	1
and	1
wonders	1
of	1
God!	1
But,	1
though	1
the	1
world	1
scouts	1
at	1
us	1
whale	1
hunters,	1
yet	1
does	1
it	1
unwittingly	1
pay	1
us	1
the	1
profoundest	1
homage;	1
yea,	1
an	1
all-abounding	1
adoration!	1
for	1
almost	1
all	1
the	1
tapers,	1
lamps,	1
and	1
candles	1
that	1
burn	1
round	1
the	1
globe,	1
burn,	1
as	1
before	1
so	1
many	1
shrines,	1
to	1
our	1
glory!	1
But	1
look	1
at	1
this	1
matter	1
in	1
other	1
lights;	1
weigh	1
it	1
in	1
all	1
sorts	1
of	1
scales;	1
see	1
what	1
we	1
whalemen	1
are,	1
and	1
have	1
been.	1
Why	1
did	1
the	1
Dutch	1
in	1
De	1
Witt's	1
time	1
have	1
admirals	1
of	1
their	1
whaling	1
fleets?	1
Why	1
did	1
Louis	1
XVI.	1
of	1
France,	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
personal	1
expense,	1
fit	1
out	1
whaling	1
ships	1
from	1
Dunkirk,	1
and	1
politely	1
invite	1
to	1
that	1
town	1
some	1
score	1
or	1
two	1
of	1
families	1
from	1
our	1
own	1
island	1
of	1
Nantucket?	1
Why	1
did	1
Britain	1
between	1
the	1
years	1
1750	1
and	1
1788	1
pay	1
to	1
her	1
whalemen	1
in	1
bounties	1
upwards	1
of	1
L1,000,000?	1
And	1
lastly,	1
how	1
comes	1
it	1
that	1
we	1
whalemen	1
of	1
America	1
now	1
outnumber	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
banded	1
whalemen	1
in	1
the	1
world;	1
sail	1
a	1
navy	1
of	1
upwards	1
of	1
seven	1
hundred	1
vessels;	1
manned	1
by	1
eighteen	1
thousand	1
men;	1
yearly	1
consuming	1
4,000,000	1
of	1
dollars;	1
the	1
ships	1
worth,	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
sailing,	1
$20,000,000!	1
and	1
every	1
year	1
importing	1
into	1
our	1
harbors	1
a	1
well	1
reaped	1
harvest	1
of	1
$7,000,000.	1
How	1
comes	1
all	1
this,	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
not	1
something	1
puissant	1
in	1
whaling?	1
But	1
this	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
half;	1
look	1
again.	1
I	1
freely	1
assert,	1
that	1
the	1
cosmopolite	1
philosopher	1
cannot,	1
for	1
his	1
life,	1
point	1
out	1
one	1
single	1
peaceful	1
influence,	1
which	1
within	1
the	1
last	1
sixty	1
years	1
has	1
operated	1
more	1
potentially	1
upon	1
the	1
whole	1
broad	1
world,	1
taken	1
in	1
one	1
aggregate,	1
than	1
the	1
high	1
and	1
mighty	1
business	1
of	1
whaling.	1
One	1
way	1
and	1
another,	1
it	1
has	1
begotten	1
events	1
so	1
remarkable	1
in	1
themselves,	1
and	1
so	1
continuously	1
momentous	1
in	1
their	1
sequential	1
issues,	1
that	1
whaling	1
may	1
well	1
be	1
regarded	1
as	1
that	1
Egyptian	1
mother,	1
who	1
bore	1
offspring	1
themselves	1
pregnant	1
from	1
her	1
womb.	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
hopeless,	1
endless	1
task	1
to	1
catalogue	1
all	1
these	1
things.	1
Let	1
a	1
handful	1
suffice.	1
For	1
many	1
years	1
past	1
the	1
whale-ship	1
has	1
been	1
the	1
pioneer	1
in	1
ferreting	1
out	1
the	1
remotest	1
and	1
least	1
known	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
She	1
has	1
explored	1
seas	1
and	1
archipelagoes	1
which	1
had	1
no	1
chart,	1
where	1
no	1
Cook	1
or	1
Vancouver	1
had	1
ever	1
sailed.	1
If	1
American	1
and	1
European	1
men-of-war	1
now	1
peacefully	1
ride	1
in	1
once	1
savage	1
harbors,	1
let	1
them	1
fire	1
salutes	1
to	1
the	1
honour	1
and	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
whale-ship,	1
which	1
originally	1
showed	1
them	1
the	1
way,	1
and	1
first	1
interpreted	1
between	1
them	1
and	1
the	1
savages.	1
They	1
may	1
celebrate	1
as	1
they	1
will	1
the	1
heroes	1
of	1
Exploring	1
Expeditions,	1
your	1
Cooks,	1
your	1
Krusensterns;	1
but	1
I	1
say	1
that	1
scores	1
of	1
anonymous	1
Captains	1
have	1
sailed	1
out	1
of	1
Nantucket,	1
that	1
were	1
as	1
great,	1
and	1
greater	1
than	1
your	1
Cook	1
and	1
your	1
Krusenstern.	1
For	1
in	1
their	1
succourless	1
empty-handedness,	1
they,	1
in	1
the	1
heathenish	1
sharked	1
waters,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
beaches	1
of	1
unrecorded,	1
javelin	1
islands,	1
battled	1
with	1
virgin	1
wonders	1
and	1
terrors	1
that	1
Cook	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
marines	1
and	1
muskets	1
would	1
not	1
willingly	1
have	1
dared.	1
All	1
that	1
is	1
made	1
such	1
a	1
flourish	1
of	1
in	1
the	1
old	1
South	1
Sea	1
Voyages,	1
those	1
things	1
were	1
but	1
the	1
life-time	1
commonplaces	1
of	1
our	1
heroic	1
Nantucketers.	1
Often,	1
adventures	1
which	1
Vancouver	1
dedicates	1
three	1
chapters	1
to,	1
these	1
men	1
accounted	1
unworthy	1
of	1
being	1
set	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
ship's	1
common	1
log.	1
Ah,	1
the	1
world!	1
Oh,	1
the	1
world!	1
Until	1
the	1
whale	1
fishery	1
rounded	1
Cape	1
Horn,	1
no	1
commerce	1
but	1
colonial,	1
scarcely	1
any	1
intercourse	1
but	1
colonial,	1
was	1
carried	1
on	1
between	1
Europe	1
and	1
the	1
long	1
line	1
of	1
the	1
opulent	1
Spanish	1
provinces	1
on	1
the	1
Pacific	1
coast.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
whaleman	1
who	1
first	1
broke	1
through	1
the	1
jealous	1
policy	1
of	1
the	1
Spanish	1
crown,	1
touching	1
those	1
colonies;	1
and,	1
if	1
space	1
permitted,	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
distinctly	1
shown	1
how	1
from	1
those	1
whalemen	1
at	1
last	1
eventuated	1
the	1
liberation	1
of	1
Peru,	1
Chili,	1
and	1
Bolivia	1
from	1
the	1
yoke	1
of	1
Old	1
Spain,	1
and	1
the	1
establishment	1
of	1
the	1
eternal	1
democracy	1
in	1
those	1
parts.	1
That	1
great	1
America	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
sphere,	1
Australia,	1
was	1
given	1
to	1
the	1
enlightened	1
world	1
by	1
the	1
whaleman.	1
After	1
its	1
first	1
blunder-born	1
discovery	1
by	1
a	1
Dutchman,	1
all	1
other	1
ships	1
long	1
shunned	1
those	1
shores	1
as	1
pestiferously	1
barbarous;	1
but	1
the	1
whale-ship	1
touched	1
there.	1
The	1
whale-ship	1
is	1
the	1
true	1
mother	1
of	1
that	1
now	1
mighty	1
colony.	1
Moreover,	1
in	1
the	1
infancy	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
Australian	1
settlement,	1
the	1
emigrants	1
were	1
several	1
times	1
saved	1
from	1
starvation	1
by	1
the	1
benevolent	1
biscuit	1
of	1
the	1
whale-ship	1
luckily	1
dropping	1
an	1
anchor	1
in	1
their	1
waters.	1
The	1
uncounted	1
isles	1
of	1
all	1
Polynesia	1
confess	1
the	1
same	1
truth,	1
and	1
do	1
commercial	1
homage	1
to	1
the	1
whale-ship,	1
that	1
cleared	1
the	1
way	1
for	1
the	1
missionary	1
and	1
the	1
merchant,	1
and	1
in	1
many	1
cases	1
carried	1
the	1
primitive	1
missionaries	1
to	1
their	1
first	1
destinations.	1
If	1
that	1
double-bolted	1
land,	1
Japan,	1
is	1
ever	1
to	1
become	1
hospitable,	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
whale-ship	1
alone	1
to	1
whom	1
the	1
credit	1
will	1
be	1
due;	1
for	1
already	1
she	1
is	1
on	1
the	1
threshold.	1
But	1
if,	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
all	1
this,	1
you	1
still	1
declare	1
that	1
whaling	1
has	1
no	1
aesthetically	1
noble	1
associations	1
connected	1
with	1
it,	1
then	1
am	1
I	1
ready	1
to	1
shiver	1
fifty	1
lances	1
with	1
you	1
there,	1
and	1
unhorse	1
you	1
with	1
a	1
split	1
helmet	1
every	1
time.	1
The	1
whale	1
has	1
no	1
famous	1
author,	1
and	1
whaling	1
no	1
famous	1
chronicler,	1
you	1
will	1
say.	1
THE	1
WHALE	1
NO	1
FAMOUS	1
AUTHOR,	1
AND	1
WHALING	1
NO	1
FAMOUS	1
CHRONICLER?	1
Who	1
wrote	1
the	1
first	1
account	1
of	1
our	1
Leviathan?	1
Who	1
but	1
mighty	1
Job!	1
And	1
who	1
composed	1
the	1
first	1
narrative	1
of	1
a	1
whaling-voyage?	1
Who,	1
but	1
no	1
less	1
a	1
prince	1
than	1
Alfred	1
the	1
Great,	1
who,	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
royal	1
pen,	1
took	1
down	1
the	1
words	1
from	1
Other,	1
the	1
Norwegian	1
whale-hunter	1
of	1
those	1
times!	1
And	1
who	1
pronounced	1
our	1
glowing	1
eulogy	1
in	1
Parliament?	1
Who,	1
but	1
Edmund	1
Burke!	1
True	1
enough,	1
but	1
then	1
whalemen	1
themselves	1
are	1
poor	1
devils;	1
they	1
have	1
no	1
good	1
blood	1
in	1
their	1
veins.	1
NO	1
GOOD	1
BLOOD	1
IN	1
THEIR	1
VEINS?	1
They	1
have	1
something	1
better	1
than	1
royal	1
blood	1
there.	1
The	1
grandmother	1
of	1
Benjamin	1
Franklin	1
was	1
Mary	1

afterwards,	1
by	1
marriage,	1
Mary	1
Folger,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
settlers	1
of	1
Nantucket,	1
and	1
the	1
ancestress	1

a	1
long	1
line	1
of	1
Folgers	1

kith	1
and	1
kin	1
to	1
noble	1
Benjamin--this	1
day	1
darting	1
the	1
barbed	1
iron	1
from	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
the	1
other.	1
Good	1
again;	1
but	1
then	1
all	1
confess	1
that	1
somehow	1
whaling	1
is	1
not	1
respectable.	1
WHALING	1
NOT	1
RESPECTABLE?	1
Whaling	1
is	1
imperial!	1
By	1
old	1
English	1
statutory	1
law,	1
the	1
whale	1
is	1
declared	1
"a	1
royal	1
fish."*	1
Oh,	1
that's	1
only	1
nominal!	1
The	1
whale	1
himself	1
has	1
never	1
figured	1
in	1
any	1
grand	1
imposing	1
way.	1
THE	1

In	1

of	1
the	1
mighty	1
triumphs	1
given	1
to	1
a	1

general	1
upon	1
his	1
entering	1
the	1

the	1
bones	1
of	1
a	1
whale,	1
brought	1
all	1

from	1
the	1

the	1

but,	1
say	1
what	1
you	1
will,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
real	1
dignity	1
in	1
whaling.	1
NO	1
DIGNITY	1
IN	1
WHALING?	1
The	1
dignity	1
of	1
our	1
calling	1
the	1
very	1
heavens	1
attest.	1
Cetus	1
is	1
a	1
constellation	1
in	1

South!	1
No	1
more!	1
Drive	1
down	1
your	1

of	1
the	1
Czar,	1
and	1
take	1
it	1
off	1
to	1
Queequeg!	1
No	1
more!	1
I	1
know	1
a	1
man	1
that,	1
in	1
his	1
lifetime,	1
has	1
taken	1
three	1
hundred	1
and	1
fifty	1
whales.	1
I	1
account	1
that	1
man	1
more	1
honourable	1
than	1
that	1
great	1
captain	1
of	1
antiquity	1
who	1
boasted	1
of	1
taking	1
as	1
many	1
walled	1
towns.	1
And,	1
as	1
for	1
me,	1
if,	1
by	1
any	1
possibility,	1
there	1
be	1
any	1
as	1
yet	1
undiscovered	1
prime	1
thing	1
in	1
me;	1
if	1
I	1
shall	1
ever	1
deserve	1
any	1
real	1
repute	1
in	1
that	1
small	1
but	1
high	1
hushed	1
world	1
which	1
I	1
might	1
not	1
be	1
unreasonably	1
ambitious	1
of;	1
if	1
hereafter	1
I	1
shall	1
do	1
anything	1
that,	1
upon	1
the	1
whole,	1
a	1
man	1
might	1
rather	1
have	1
done	1
than	1
to	1
have	1
left	1
undone;	1
if,	1
at	1
my	1
death,	1
my	1
executors,	1
or	1
more	1
properly	1
my	1
creditors,	1
find	1
any	1
precious	1
MSS.	1
in	1
my	1
desk,	1
then	1
here	1
I	1
prospectively	1
ascribe	1
all	1
the	1
honour	1
and	1
the	1
glory	1
to	1
whaling;	1
for	1
a	1
whale-ship	1
was	1
my	1
Yale	1

and	1
my	1
Harvard.	1
CHAPTER	1
25	1
Postscript.	1
In	1
behalf	1
of	1
the	1
dignity	1
of	1
whaling,	1
I	1
would	1
fain	1
advance	1
naught	1
but	1
substantiated	1
facts.	1
But	1
after	1
embattling	1
his	1
facts,	1
an	1
advocate	1
who	1
should	1
wholly	1
suppress	1
a	1
not	1
unreasonable	1
surmise,	1
which	1
might	1
tell	1
eloquently	1
upon	1
his	1
cause--such	1
an	1
advocate,	1
would	1
he	1
not	1
be	1
blameworthy?	1
It	1
is	1
well	1
known	1
that	1
at	1
the	1
coronation	1
of	1
kings	1
and	1
queens,	1
even	1
modern	1
ones,	1
a	1
certain	1
curious	1
process	1
of	1
seasoning	1
them	1
for	1
their	1
functions	1
is	1
gone	1
through.	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
saltcellar	1
of	1
state,	1
so	1
called,	1
and	1
there	1
may	1
be	1
a	1
castor	1
of	1
state.	1
How	1
they	1
use	1
the	1
salt,	1
precisely--who	1
knows?	1
Certain	1
I	1
am,	1
however,	1
that	1
a	1
king's	1
head	1
is	1
solemnly	1
oiled	1
at	1
his	1
coronation,	1
even	1
as	1
a	1
head	1
of	1
salad.	1
Can	1
it	1
be,	1
though,	1
that	1
they	1
anoint	1
it	1
with	1
a	1
view	1
of	1
making	1
its	1
interior	1
run	1
well,	1
as	1
they	1
anoint	1
machinery?	1
Much	1
might	1
be	1
ruminated	1
here,	1
concerning	1
the	1
essential	1
dignity	1
of	1
this	1
regal	1
process,	1
because	1
in	1
common	1
life	1
we	1
esteem	1
but	1
meanly	1
and	1
contemptibly	1
a	1
fellow	1
who	1
anoints	1
his	1
hair,	1
and	1
palpably	1
smells	1
of	1
that	1
anointing.	1
In	1
truth,	1
a	1
mature	1
man	1
who	1
uses	1
hair-oil,	1
unless	1
medicinally,	1
that	1
man	1
has	1
probably	1
got	1
a	1
quoggy	1
spot	1
in	1
him	1
somewhere.	1
As	1
a	1
general	1
rule,	1
he	1
can't	1
amount	1
to	1
much	1
in	1
his	1
totality.	1
But	1
the	1
only	1
thing	1
to	1
be	1
considered	1
here,	1
is	1
this--what	1
kind	1
of	1
oil	1
is	1
used	1
at	1
coronations?	1
Certainly	1
it	1
cannot	1
be	1
olive	1
oil,	1
nor	1
macassar	1
oil,	1
nor	1
castor	1
oil,	1
nor	1
bear's	1
oil,	1
nor	1
train	1
oil,	1
nor	1
cod-liver	1
oil.	1
What	1
then	1
can	1
it	1
possibly	1
be,	1
but	1
sperm	1
oil	1
in	1
its	1
unmanufactured,	1
unpolluted	1
state,	1
the	1
sweetest	1
of	1
all	1
oils?	1
Think	1
of	1
that,	1
ye	1
loyal	1
Britons!	1
we	1
whalemen	1
supply	1
your	1
kings	1
and	1
queens	1
with	1
coronation	1
stuff!	1
CHAPTER	1
26	1
Knights	1
and	1
Squires.	1
The	1
chief	1
mate	1
of	1
the	1
Pequod	1
was	1
Starbuck,	1
a	1
native	1
of	1
Nantucket,	1
and	1
a	1
Quaker	1
by	1
descent.	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
long,	1
earnest	1
man,	1
and	1
though	1
born	1
on	1
an	1
icy	1
coast,	1
seemed	1
well	1
adapted	1
to	1
endure	1
hot	1
latitudes,	1
his	1
flesh	1
being	1
hard	1
as	1
twice-baked	1
biscuit.	1
Transported	1
to	1
the	1
Indies,	1
his	1
live	1
blood	1
would	1
not	1
spoil	1
like	1
bottled	1
ale.	1
He	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
born	1
in	1
some	1
time	1
of	1
general	1
drought	1
and	1
famine,	1
or	1
upon	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
fast	1
days	1
for	1
which	1
his	1
state	1
is	1
famous.	1
Only	1
some	1
thirty	1
arid	1
summers	1
had	1
he	1
seen;	1
those	1
summers	1
had	1
dried	1
up	1
all	1
his	1
physical	1
superfluousness.	1
But	1
this,	1
his	1
thinness,	1
so	1
to	1
speak,	1
seemed	1
no	1
more	1
the	1
token	1
of	1
wasting	1
anxieties	1
and	1
cares,	1
than	1
it	1
seemed	1
the	1
indication	1
of	1
any	1
bodily	1
blight.	1
It	1
was	1
merely	1
the	1
condensation	1
of	1
the	1
man.	1
He	1
was	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
ill-looking;	1
quite	1
the	1
contrary.	1
His	1
pure	1
tight	1
skin	1
was	1
an	1
excellent	1
fit;	1
and	1
closely	1
wrapped	1
up	1
in	1
it,	1
and	1
embalmed	1
with	1
inner	1
health	1
and	1
strength,	1
like	1
a	1
revivified	1
Egyptian,	1
this	1
Starbuck	1
seemed	1
prepared	1
to	1
endure	1
for	1
long	1
ages	1
to	1
come,	1
and	1
to	1
endure	1
always,	1
as	1
now;	1
for	1
be	1
it	1
Polar	1
snow	1
or	1
torrid	1
sun,	1
like	1
a	1
patent	1
chronometer,	1
his	1
interior	1
vitality	1
was	1
warranted	1
to	1
do	1
well	1
in	1
all	1
climates.	1
Looking	1
into	1
his	1
eyes,	1
you	1
seemed	1
to	1
see	1
there	1
the	1
yet	1
lingering	1
images	1
of	1
those	1
thousand-fold	1
perils	1
he	1
had	1
calmly	1
confronted	1
through	1
life.	1
A	1
staid,	1
steadfast	1
man,	1
whose	1
life	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
part	1
was	1
a	1
telling	1
pantomime	1
of	1
action,	1
and	1
not	1
a	1
tame	1
chapter	1
of	1
sounds.	1
Yet,	1
for	1
all	1
his	1
hardy	1
sobriety	1
and	1
fortitude,	1
there	1
were	1
certain	1
qualities	1
in	1
him	1
which	1
at	1
times	1
affected,	1
and	1
in	1
some	1
cases	1
seemed	1
well	1
nigh	1
to	1
overbalance	1
all	1
the	1
rest.	1
Uncommonly	1
conscientious	1
for	1
a	1
seaman,	1
and	1
endued	1
with	1
a	1
deep	1
natural	1
reverence,	1
the	1
wild	1
watery	1
loneliness	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
did	1
therefore	1
strongly	1
incline	1
him	1
to	1
superstition;	1
but	1
to	1
that	1
sort	1
of	1
superstition,	1
which	1
in	1
some	1
organizations	1
seems	1
rather	1
to	1
spring,	1
somehow,	1
from	1
intelligence	1
than	1
from	1
ignorance.	1
Outward	1
portents	1
and	1
inward	1
presentiments	1
were	1
his.	1
And	1
if	1
at	1
times	1
these	1
things	1
bent	1
the	1
welded	1
iron	1
of	1
his	1
soul,	1
much	1
more	1
did	1
his	1
far-away	1
domestic	1
memories	1
of	1
his	1
young	1
Cape	1
wife	1
and	1
child,	1
tend	1
to	1
bend	1
him	1
still	1
more	1
from	1
the	1
original	1
ruggedness	1
of	1
his	1
nature,	1
and	1
open	1
him	1
still	1
further	1
to	1
those	1
latent	1
influences	1
which,	1
in	1
some	1
honest-hearted	1
men,	1
restrain	1
the	1
gush	1
of	1
dare-devil	1
daring,	1
so	1
often	1
evinced	1
by	1
others	1
in	1
the	1
more	1
perilous	1
vicissitudes	1
of	1
the	1
fishery.	1
"I	1
will	1
have	1
no	1
man	1
in	1
my	1
boat,"	1
said	1
Starbuck,	1
"who	1
is	1
not	1
afraid	1
of	1
a	1
whale."	1
By	1
this,	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
mean,	1
not	1
only	1
that	1
the	1
most	1
reliable	1
and	1
useful	1
courage	1
was	1
that	1
which	1
arises	1
from	1
the	1
fair	1
estimation	1
of	1
the	1
encountered	1
peril,	1
but	1
that	1
an	1
utterly	1
fearless	1
man	1
is	1
a	1
far	1
more	1
dangerous	1
comrade	1
than	1
a	1
coward.	1
"Aye,	1
aye,"	1
said	1
Stubb,	1
the	1
second	1
mate,	1
"Starbuck,	1
there,	1
is	1
as	1
careful	1
a	1
man	1
as	1
you'll	1
find	1
anywhere	1
in	1
this	1
fishery."	1
But	1
we	1
shall	1
ere	1
long	1
see	1
what	1
that	1
word	1
"careful"	1
precisely	1
means	1
when	1
used	1
by	1
a	1
man	1
like	1
Stubb,	1
or	1
almost	1
any	1
other	1
whale	1
hunter.	1
Starbuck	1
was	1
no	1
crusader	1
after	1
perils;	1
in	1
him	1
courage	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
sentiment;	1
but	1
a	1
thing	1
simply	1
useful	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
always	1
at	1
hand	1
upon	1
all	1
mortally	1
practical	1
occasions.	1
Besides,	1
he	1
thought,	1
perhaps,	1
that	1
in	1
this	1
business	1
of	1
whaling,	1
courage	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
staple	1
outfits	1
of	1
the	1
ship,	1
like	1
her	1
beef	1
and	1
her	1
bread,	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
foolishly	1
wasted.	1
Wherefore	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
fancy	1
for	1
lowering	1
for	1
whales	1
after	1
sun-down;	1
nor	1
for	1
persisting	1
in	1
fighting	1
a	1
fish	1
that	1
too	1
much	1
persisted	1
in	1
fighting	1
him.	1
For,	1
thought	1
Starbuck,	1
I	1
am	1
here	1
in	1
this	1
critical	1
ocean	1
to	1
kill	1
whales	1
for	1
my	1
living,	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
killed	1
by	1
them	1
for	1
theirs;	1
and	1
that	1
hundreds	1
of	1
men	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
killed	1
Starbuck	1
well	1
knew.	1
What	1
doom	1
was	1
his	1
own	1
father's?	1
Where,	1
in	1
the	1
bottomless	1
deeps,	1
could	1
he	1
find	1
the	1
torn	1
limbs	1
of	1
his	1
brother?	1
With	1
memories	1
like	1
these	1
in	1
him,	1
and,	1
moreover,	1
given	1
to	1
a	1
certain	1
superstitiousness,	1
as	1
has	1
been	1
said;	1
the	1
courage	1
of	1
this	1
Starbuck	1
which	1
could,	1
nevertheless,	1
still	1
flourish,	1
must	1
indeed	1
have	1
been	1
extreme.	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
reasonable	1
nature	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
so	1
organized,	1
and	1
with	1
such	1
terrible	1
experiences	1
and	1
remembrances	1
as	1
he	1
had;	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
nature	1
that	1
these	1
things	1
should	1
fail	1
in	1
latently	1
engendering	1
an	1
element	1
in	1
him,	1
which,	1
under	1
suitable	1
circumstances,	1
would	1
break	1
out	1
from	1
its	1
confinement,	1
and	1
burn	1
all	1
his	1
courage	1
up.	1
And	1
brave	1
as	1
he	1
might	1
be,	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
sort	1
of	1
bravery	1
chiefly,	1
visible	1
in	1
some	1
intrepid	1
men,	1
which,	1
while	1
generally	1
abiding	1
firm	1
in	1
the	1
conflict	1
with	1
seas,	1
or	1
winds,	1
or	1
whales,	1
or	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
ordinary	1
irrational	1
horrors	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
yet	1
cannot	1
withstand	1
those	1
more	1
terrific,	1
because	1
more	1
spiritual	1
terrors,	1
which	1
sometimes	1
menace	1
you	1
from	1
the	1
concentrating	1
brow	1
of	1
an	1
enraged	1
and	1
mighty	1
man.	1
But	1
were	1
the	1
coming	1
narrative	1
to	1
reveal	1
in	1
any	1
instance,	1
the	1
complete	1
abasement	1
of	1
poor	1
Starbuck's	1
fortitude,	1
scarce	1
might	1
I	1
have	1
the	1
heart	1
to	1
write	1
it;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
thing	1
most	1
sorrowful,	1
nay	1
shocking,	1
to	1
expose	1
the	1
fall	1
of	1
valour	1
in	1
the	1
soul.	1
Men	1
may	1
seem	1
detestable	1
as	1
joint	1
stock-companies	1
and	1
nations;	1
knaves,	1
fools,	1
and	1
murderers	1
there	1
may	1
be;	1
men	1
may	1
have	1
mean	1
and	1
meagre	1
faces;	1
but	1
man,	1
in	1
the	1
ideal,	1
is	1
so	1
noble	1
and	1
so	1
sparkling,	1
such	1
a	1
grand	1
and	1
glowing	1
creature,	1
that	1
over	1
any	1
ignominious	1
blemish	1
in	1
him	1
all	1
his	1
fellows	1
should	1
run	1
to	1
throw	1
their	1
costliest	1
robes.	1
That	1
immaculate	1
manliness	1
we	1
feel	1
within	1
ourselves,	1
so	1
far	1
within	1
us,	1
that	1
it	1
remains	1
intact	1
though	1
all	1
the	1
outer	1
character	1
seem	1
gone;	1
bleeds	1
with	1
keenest	1
anguish	1
at	1
the	1
undraped	1
spectacle	1
of	1
a	1
valor-ruined	1
man.	1
Nor	1
can	1
piety	1
itself,	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
shameful	1
sight,	1
completely	1
stifle	1
her	1
upbraidings	1
against	1
the	1
permitting	1
stars.	1
But	1
this	1
august	1
dignity	1
I	1
treat	1
of,	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
dignity	1
of	1
kings	1
and	1
robes,	1
but	1
that	1
abounding	1
dignity	1
which	1
has	1
no	1
robed	1
investiture.	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
see	1
it	1
shining	1
in	1
the	1
arm	1
that	1
wields	1
a	1
pick	1
or	1
drives	1
a	1
spike;	1
that	1
democratic	1
dignity	1
which,	1
on	1
all	1
hands,	1
radiates	1
without	1
end	1
from	1
God;	1
Himself!	1
The	1
great	1
God	1
absolute!	1
The	1
centre	1
and	1
circumference	1
of	1
all	1
democracy!	1
His	1
omnipresence,	1
our	1
divine	1
equality!	1
If,	1
then,	1
to	1
meanest	1
mariners,	1
and	1
renegades	1
and	1
castaways,	1
I	1
shall	1
hereafter	1
ascribe	1
high	1
qualities,	1
though	1
dark;	1
weave	1
round	1
them	1
tragic	1
graces;	1
if	1
even	1
the	1
most	1
mournful,	1
perchance	1
the	1
most	1
abased,	1
among	1
them	1
all,	1
shall	1
at	1
times	1
lift	1
himself	1
to	1
the	1
exalted	1
mounts;	1
if	1
I	1
shall	1
touch	1
that	1
workman's	1
arm	1
with	1
some	1
ethereal	1
light;	1
if	1
I	1
shall	1
spread	1
a	1
rainbow	1
over	1
his	1
disastrous	1
set	1
of	1
sun;	1
then	1
against	1
all	1
mortal	1
critics	1
bear	1
me	1
out	1
in	1
it,	1
thou	1
Just	1
Spirit	1
of	1
Equality,	1
which	1
hast	1
spread	1
one	1
royal	1
mantle	1
of	1
humanity	1
over	1
all	1
my	1
kind!	1
Bear	1
me	1
out	1
in	1
it,	1
thou	1
great	1
democratic	1
God!	1
who	1
didst	1
not	1
refuse	1
to	1
the	1
swart	1
convict,	1
Bunyan,	1
the	1
pale,	1
poetic	1
pearl;	1
Thou	1
who	1
didst	1
clothe	1
with	1
doubly	1
hammered	1
leaves	1
of	1
finest	1
gold,	1
the	1
stumped	1
and	1
paupered	1
arm	1
of	1
old	1
Cervantes;	1
Thou	1
who	1
didst	1
pick	1
up	1
Andrew	1
Jackson	1
from	1
the	1
pebbles;	1
who	1
didst	1
hurl	1
him	1
upon	1
a	1
war-horse;	1
who	1
didst	1
thunder	1
him	1
higher	1
than	1
a	1
throne!	1
Thou	1
who,	1
in	1
all	1
Thy	1
mighty,	1
earthly	1
marchings,	1
ever	1
cullest	1
Thy	1
selectest	1
champions	1
from	1
the	1
kingly	1
commons;	1
bear	1
me	1
out	1
in	1
it,	1
O	1
God!	1
CHAPTER	1
27	1
Knights	1
and	1
Squires.	1
Stubb	1
was	1
the	1
second	1
mate.	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
native	1
of	1
Cape	1
Cod;	1
and	1
hence,	1
according	1
to	1
local	1
usage,	1
was	1
called	1
a	1
Cape-Cod-man.	1
A	1
happy-go-lucky;	1
neither	1
craven	1
nor	1
valiant;	1
taking	1
perils	1
as	1
they	1
came	1
with	1
an	1
indifferent	1
air;	1
and	1
while	1
engaged	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
imminent	1
crisis	1
of	1
the	1
chase,	1
toiling	1
away,	1
calm	1
and	1
collected	1
as	1
a	1
journeyman	1
joiner	1
engaged	1
for	1
the	1
year.	1
Good-humored,	1
easy,	1
and	1
careless,	1
he	1
presided	1
over	1
his	1
whale-boat	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
most	1
deadly	1
encounter	1
were	1
but	1
a	1
dinner,	1
and	1
his	1
crew	1
all	1
invited	1
guests.	1
He	1
was	1
as	1
particular	1
about	1
the	1
comfortable	1
arrangement	1
of	1
his	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
boat,	1
as	1
an	1
old	1
stage-driver	1
is	1
about	1
the	1
snugness	1
of	1
his	1
box.	1
When	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
whale,	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
death-lock	1
of	1
the	1
fight,	1
he	1
handled	1
his	1
unpitying	1
lance	1
coolly	1
and	1
off-handedly,	1
as	1
a	1
whistling	1
tinker	1
his	1
hammer.	1
He	1
would	1
hum	1
over	1
his	1
old	1
rigadig	1
tunes	1
while	1
flank	1
and	1
flank	1
with	1
the	1
most	1
exasperated	1
monster.	1
Long	1
usage	1
had,	1
for	1
this	1
Stubb,	1
converted	1
the	1
jaws	1
of	1
death	1
into	1
an	1
easy	1
chair.	1
What	1
he	1
thought	1
of	1
death	1
itself,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
telling.	1
Whether	1
he	1
ever	1
thought	1
of	1
it	1
at	1
all,	1
might	1
be	1
a	1
question;	1
but,	1
if	1
he	1
ever	1
did	1
chance	1
to	1
cast	1
his	1
mind	1
that	1
way	1
after	1
a	1
comfortable	1
dinner,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
like	1
a	1
good	1
sailor,	1
he	1
took	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
call	1
of	1
the	1
watch	1
to	1
tumble	1
aloft,	1
and	1
bestir	1
themselves	1
there,	1
about	1
something	1
which	1
he	1
would	1
find	1
out	1
when	1
he	1
obeyed	1
the	1
order,	1
and	1
not	1
sooner.	1
What,	1
perhaps,	1
with	1
other	1
things,	1
made	1
Stubb	1
such	1
an	1
easy-going,	1
unfearing	1
man,	1
so	1
cheerily	1
trudging	1
off	1
with	1
the	1
burden	1
of	1
life	1
in	1
a	1
world	1
full	1
of	1
grave	1
pedlars,	1
all	1
bowed	1
to	1
the	1
ground	1
with	1
their	1
packs;	1
what	1
helped	1
to	1
bring	1
about	1
that	1
almost	1
impious	1
good-humor	1
of	1
his;	1
that	1
thing	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
his	1
pipe.	1
For,	1
like	1
his	1
nose,	1
his	1
short,	1
black	1
little	1
pipe	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
regular	1
features	1
of	1
his	1
face.	1
You	1
would	1
almost	1
as	1
soon	1
have	1
expected	1
him	1
to	1
turn	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
bunk	1
without	1
his	1
nose	1
as	1
without	1
his	1
pipe.	1
He	1
kept	1
a	1
whole	1
row	1
of	1
pipes	1
there	1
ready	1
loaded,	1
stuck	1
in	1
a	1
rack,	1
within	1
easy	1
reach	1
of	1
his	1
hand;	1
and,	1
whenever	1
he	1
turned	1
in,	1
he	1
smoked	1
them	1
all	1
out	1
in	1
succession,	1
lighting	1
one	1
from	1
the	1
other	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
chapter;	1
then	1
loading	1
them	1
again	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
readiness	1
anew.	1
For,	1
when	1
Stubb	1
dressed,	1
instead	1
of	1
first	1
putting	1
his	1
legs	1
into	1
his	1
trowsers,	1
he	1
put	1
his	1
pipe	1
into	1
his	1
mouth.	1
I	1
say	1
this	1
continual	1
smoking	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
one	1
cause,	1
at	1
least,	1
of	1
his	1
peculiar	1
disposition;	1
for	1
every	1
one	1
knows	1
that	1
this	1
earthly	1
air,	1
whether	1
ashore	1
or	1
afloat,	1
is	1
terribly	1
infected	1
with	1
the	1
nameless	1
miseries	1
of	1
the	1
numberless	1
mortals	1
who	1
have	1
died	1
exhaling	1
it;	1
and	1
as	1
in	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
cholera,	1
some	1
people	1
go	1
about	1
with	1
a	1
camphorated	1
handkerchief	1
to	1
their	1
mouths;	1
so,	1
likewise,	1
against	1
all	1
mortal	1
tribulations,	1
Stubb's	1
tobacco	1
smoke	1
might	1
have	1
operated	1
as	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
disinfecting	1
agent.	1
The	1
third	1
mate	1
was	1
Flask,	1
a	1
native	1
of	1
Tisbury,	1
in	1
Martha's	1
Vineyard.	1
A	1
short,	1
stout,	1
ruddy	1
young	1
fellow,	1
very	1
pugnacious	1
concerning	1
whales,	1
who	1
somehow	1
seemed	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
the	1
great	1
leviathans	1
had	1
personally	1
and	1
hereditarily	1
affronted	1
him;	1
and	1
therefore	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
point	1
of	1
honour	1
with	1
him,	1
to	1
destroy	1
them	1
whenever	1
encountered.	1
So	1
utterly	1
lost	1
was	1
he	1
to	1
all	1
sense	1
of	1
reverence	1
for	1
the	1
many	1
marvels	1
of	1
their	1
majestic	1
bulk	1
and	1
mystic	1
ways;	1
and	1
so	1
dead	1
to	1
anything	1
like	1
an	1
apprehension	1
of	1
any	1
possible	1
danger	1
from	1
encountering	1
them;	1
that	1
in	1
his	1
poor	1
opinion,	1
the	1
wondrous	1
whale	1
was	1
but	1
a	1
species	1
of	1
magnified	1
mouse,	1
or	1
at	1
least	1
water-rat,	1
requiring	1
only	1
a	1
little	1
circumvention	1
and	1
some	1
small	1
application	1
of	1
time	1
and	1
trouble	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
kill	1
and	1
boil.	1
This	1
ignorant,	1
unconscious	1
fearlessness	1
of	1
his	1
made	1
him	1
a	1
little	1
waggish	1
in	1
the	1
matter	1
of	1
whales;	1
he	1
followed	1
these	1
fish	1
for	1
the	1
fun	1
of	1
it;	1
and	1
a	1
three	1
years'	1
voyage	1
round	1
Cape	1
Horn	1
was	1
only	1
a	1
jolly	1
joke	1
that	1
lasted	1
that	1
length	1
of	1
time.	1
As	1
a	1
carpenter's	1
nails	1
are	1
divided	1
into	1
wrought	1
nails	1
and	1
cut	1
nails;	1
so	1
mankind	1
may	1
be	1
similarly	1
divided.	1
Little	1
Flask	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
wrought	1
ones;	1
made	1
to	1
clinch	1
tight	1
and	1
last	1
long.	1
They	1
called	1
him	1
King-Post	1
on	1
board	1
of	1
the	1
Pequod;	1
because,	1
in	1
form,	1
he	1
could	1
be	1
well	1
likened	1
to	1
the	1
short,	1
square	1
timber	1
known	1
by	1
that	1
name	1
in	1
Arctic	1
whalers;	1
and	1
which	1
by	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
many	1
radiating	1
side	1
timbers	1
inserted	1
into	1
it,	1
serves	1
to	1
brace	1
the	1
ship	1
against	1
the	1
icy	1
concussions	1
of	1
those	1
battering	1
seas.	1
Now	1
these	1
three	1
mates--Starbuck,	1
Stubb,	1
and	1
Flask,	1
were	1
momentous	1
men.	1
They	1
it	1
was	1
who	1
by	1
universal	1
prescription	1
commanded	1
three	1
of	1
the	1
Pequod's	1
boats	1
as	1
headsmen.	1
In	1
that	1
grand	1
order	1
of	1
battle	1
in	1
which	1
Captain	1
Ahab	1
would	1
probably	1
marshal	1
his	1
forces	1
to	1
descend	1
on	1
the	1
whales,	1
these	1
three	1
headsmen	1
were	1
as	1
captains	1
of	1
companies.	1
Or,	1
being	1
armed	1
with	1
their	1
long	1
keen	1
whaling	1
spears,	1
they	1
were	1
as	1
a	1
picked	1
trio	1
of	1
lancers;	1
even	1
as	1
the	1
harpooneers	1
were	1
flingers	1
of	1
javelins.	1
And	1
since	1
in	1
this	1
famous	1
fishery,	1
each	1
mate	1
or	1
headsman,	1
like	1
a	1
Gothic	1
Knight	1
of	1
old,	1
is	1
always	1
accompanied	1
by	1
his	1
boat-steerer	1
or	1
harpooneer,	1
who	1
in	1
certain	1
conjunctures	1
provides	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
fresh	1
lance,	1
when	1
the	1
former	1
one	1
has	1
been	1
badly	1
twisted,	1
or	1
elbowed	1
in	1
the	1
assault;	1
and	1
moreover,	1
as	1
there	1
generally	1
subsists	1
between	1
the	1
two,	1
a	1
close	1
intimacy	1
and	1
friendliness;	1
it	1
is	1
therefore	1
but	1
meet,	1
that	1
in	1
this	1
place	1
we	1
set	1
down	1
who	1
the	1
Pequod's	1
harpooneers	1
were,	1
and	1
to	1
what	1
headsman	1
each	1
of	1
them	1
belonged.	1
First	1
of	1
all	1
was	1
Queequeg,	1
whom	1
Starbuck,	1
the	1
chief	1
mate,	1
had	1
selected	1
for	1
his	1
squire.	1
But	1
Queequeg	1
is	1
already	1
known.	1
Next	1
was	1
Tashtego,	1
an	1
unmixed	1
Indian	1
from	1
Gay	1
Head,	1
the	1
most	1
westerly	1
promontory	1
of	1
Martha's	1
Vineyard,	1
where	1
there	1
still	1
exists	1
the	1
last	1
remnant	1
of	1
a	1
village	1
of	1
red	1
men,	1
which	1
has	1
long	1
supplied	1
the	1
neighboring	1
island	1
of	1
Nantucket	1
with	1
many	1
of	1
her	1
most	1
daring	1
harpooneers.	1
In	1
the	1
fishery,	1
they	1
usually	1
go	1
by	1
the	1
generic	1
name	1
of	1
Gay-Headers.	1
Tashtego's	1
long,	1
lean,	1
sable	1
hair,	1
his	1
high	1
cheek	1
bones,	1
and	1
black	1
rounding	1
eyes--for	1
an	1
Indian,	1
Oriental	1
in	1
their	1
largeness,	1
but	1
Antarctic	1
in	1
their	1
glittering	1
expression--all	1
this	1
sufficiently	1
proclaimed	1
him	1
an	1
inheritor	1
of	1
the	1
unvitiated	1
blood	1
of	1
those	1
proud	1
warrior	1
hunters,	1
who,	1
in	1
quest	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
New	1
England	1
moose,	1
had	1
scoured,	1
bow	1
in	1
hand,	1
the	1
aboriginal	1
forests	1
of	1
the	1
main.	1
But	1
no	1
longer	1
snuffing	1
in	1
the	1
trail	1
of	1
the	1
wild	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
woodland,	1
Tashtego	1
now	1
hunted	1
in	1
the	1
wake	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
whales	1
of	1
the	1
sea;	1
the	1
unerring	1
harpoon	1
of	1
the	1
son	1
fitly	1
replacing	1
the	1
infallible	1
arrow	1
of	1
the	1
sires.	1
To	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
tawny	1
brawn	1
of	1
his	1
lithe	1
snaky	1
limbs,	1
you	1
would	1
almost	1
have	1
credited	1
the	1
superstitions	1
of	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
earlier	1
Puritans,	1
and	1
half-believed	1
this	1
wild	1
Indian	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
son	1
of	1
the	1
Prince	1
of	1
the	1
Powers	1
of	1
the	1
Air.	1
Tashtego	1
was	1
Stubb	1
the	1
second	1
mate's	1
squire.	1
Third	1
among	1
the	1
harpooneers	1
was	1
Daggoo,	1
a	1
gigantic,	1
coal-black	1
negro-savage,	1
with	1
a	1
lion-like	1
tread--an	1
Ahasuerus	1
to	1
behold.	1
Suspended	1
from	1
his	1
ears	1
were	1
two	1
golden	1
hoops,	1
so	1
large	1
that	1
the	1
sailors	1
called	1
them	1
ring-bolts,	1
and	1
would	1
talk	1
of	1
securing	1
the	1
top-sail	1
halyards	1
to	1
them.	1
In	1
his	1
youth	1
Daggoo	1
had	1
voluntarily	1
shipped	1
on	1
board	1
of	1
a	1
whaler,	1
lying	1
in	1
a	1
lonely	1
bay	1
on	1
his	1
native	1
coast.	1
And	1
never	1
having	1
been	1
anywhere	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
but	1
in	1
Africa,	1
Nantucket,	1
and	1
the	1
pagan	1
harbors	1
most	1
frequented	1
by	1
whalemen;	1
and	1
having	1
now	1
led	1
for	1
many	1
years	1
the	1
bold	1
life	1
of	1
the	1
fishery	1
in	1
the	1
ships	1
of	1
owners	1
uncommonly	1
heedful	1
of	1
what	1
manner	1
of	1
men	1
they	1
shipped;	1
Daggoo	1
retained	1
all	1
his	1
barbaric	1
virtues,	1
and	1
erect	1
as	1
a	1
giraffe,	1
moved	1
about	1
the	1
decks	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
pomp	1
of	1
six	1
feet	1
five	1
in	1
his	1
socks.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
corporeal	1
humility	1
in	1
looking	1
up	1
at	1
him;	1
and	1
a	1
white	1
man	1
standing	1
before	1
him	1
seemed	1
a	1
white	1
flag	1
come	1
to	1
beg	1
truce	1
of	1
a	1
fortress.	1
Curious	1
to	1
tell,	1
this	1
imperial	1
negro,	1
Ahasuerus	1
Daggoo,	1
was	1
the	1
Squire	1
of	1
little	1
Flask,	1
who	1
looked	1
like	1
a	1
chess-man	1
beside	1
him.	1
As	1
for	1
the	1
residue	1
of	1
the	1
Pequod's	1
company,	1
be	1
it	1
said,	1
that	1
at	1
the	1
present	1
day	1
not	1
one	1
in	1
two	1
of	1
the	1
many	1
thousand	1
men	1
before	1
the	1
mast	1
employed	1
in	1
the	1
American	1
whale	1
fishery,	1
are	1
Americans	1
born,	1
though	1
pretty	1
nearly	1
all	1
the	1
officers	1
are.	1
Herein	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
same	1
with	1
the	1
American	1
whale	1
fishery	1
as	1
with	1
the	1
American	1
army	1
and	1
military	1
and	1
merchant	1
navies,	1
and	1
the	1
engineering	1
forces	1
employed	1
in	1
the	1
construction	1
of	1
the	1
American	1
Canals	1
and	1
Railroads.	1
The	1
same,	1
I	1
say,	1
because	1
in	1
all	1
these	1
cases	1
the	1
native	1
American	1
liberally	1
provides	1
the	1
brains,	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
as	1
generously	1
supplying	1
the	1
muscles.	1
No	1
small	1
number	1
of	1
these	1
whaling	1
seamen	1
belong	1
to	1
the	1
Azores,	1
where	1
the	1
outward	1
bound	1
Nantucket	1
whalers	1
frequently	1
touch	1
to	1
augment	1
their	1
crews	1
from	1
the	1
hardy	1
peasants	1
of	1
those	1
rocky	1
shores.	1
In	1
like	1
manner,	1
the	1
Greenland	1
whalers	1
sailing	1
out	1
of	1
Hull	1
or	1
London,	1
put	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
Shetland	1
Islands,	1
to	1
receive	1
the	1
full	1
complement	1
of	1
their	1
crew.	1
Upon	1
the	1
passage	1
homewards,	1
they	1
drop	1
them	1
there	1
again.	1
How	1
it	1
is,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
telling,	1
but	1
Islanders	1
seem	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
best	1
whalemen.	1
They	1
were	1
nearly	1
all	1
Islanders	1
in	1
the	1
Pequod,	1
ISOLATOES	1
too,	1
I	1
call	1
such,	1
not	1
acknowledging	1
the	1
common	1
continent	1
of	1
men,	1
but	1
each	1
ISOLATO	1
living	1
on	1
a	1
separate	1
continent	1
of	1
his	1
own.	1
Yet	1
now,	1
federated	1
along	1
one	1
keel,	1
what	1
a	1
set	1
these	1
Isolatoes	1
were!	1
An	1
Anacharsis	1
Clootz	1
deputation	1
from	1
all	1
the	1
isles	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
accompanying	1
Old	1
Ahab	1
in	1
the	1
Pequod	1
to	1
lay	1
the	1
world's	1
grievances	1
before	1
that	1
bar	1
from	1
which	1
not	1
very	1
many	1
of	1
them	1
ever	1
come	1
back.	1
Black	1
Little	1
Pip--he	1
never	1
did--oh,	1
no!	1
he	1
went	1
before.	1
Poor	1
Alabama	1
boy!	1
On	1
the	1
grim	1
Pequod's	1
forecastle,	1
ye	1
shall	1
ere	1
long	1
see	1
him,	1
beating	1
his	1
tambourine;	1
prelusive	1
of	1
the	1
eternal	1
time,	1
when	1
sent	1
for,	1
to	1
the	1
great	1
quarter-deck	1
on	1
high,	1
he	1
was	1
bid	1
strike	1
in	1
with	1
angels,	1
and	1
beat	1
his	1
tambourine	1
in	1
glory;	1
called	1
a	1
coward	1
here,	1
hailed	1
a	1
hero	1
there!	1
CHAPTER	1
28	1
Ahab.	1
For	1
several	1
days	1
after	1
leaving	1
Nantucket,	1
nothing	1
above	1
hatches	1
was	1
seen	1
of	1
Captain	1
Ahab.	1
The	1
mates	1
regularly	1
relieved	1
each	1
other	1
at	1
the	1
watches,	1
and	1
for	1
aught	1
that	1
could	1
be	1
seen	1
to	1
the	1
contrary,	1
they	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
only	1
commanders	1
of	1
the	1
ship;	1
only	1
they	1
sometimes	1
issued	1
from	1
the	1
cabin	1
with	1
orders	1
so	1
sudden	1
and	1
peremptory,	1
that	1
after	1
all	1
it	1
was	1
plain	1
they	1
but	1
commanded	1
vicariously.	1
Yes,	1
their	1
supreme	1
lord	1
and	1
dictator	1
was	1
there,	1
though	1
hitherto	1
unseen	1
by	1
any	1
eyes	1
not	1
permitted	1
to	1
penetrate	1
into	1
the	1
now	1
sacred	1
retreat	1
of	1
the	1
cabin.	1
Every	1
time	1
I	1
ascended	1
to	1
the	1
deck	1
from	1
my	1
watches	1
below,	1
I	1
instantly	1
gazed	1
aft	1
to	1
mark	1
if	1
any	1
strange	1
face	1
were	1
visible;	1
for	1
my	1
first	1
vague	1
disquietude	1
touching	1
the	1
unknown	1
captain,	1
now	1
in	1
the	1
seclusion	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
became	1
almost	1
a	1
perturbation.	1
This	1
was	1
strangely	1
heightened	1
at	1
times	1
by	1
the	1
ragged	1
Elijah's	1
diabolical	1
incoherences	1
uninvitedly	1
recurring	1
to	1
me,	1
with	1
a	1
subtle	1
energy	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
before	1
conceived	1
of.	1
But	1
poorly	1
could	1
I	1
withstand	1
them,	1
much	1
as	1
in	1
other	1
moods	1
I	1
was	1
almost	1
ready	1
to	1
smile	1
at	1
the	1
solemn	1
whimsicalities	1
of	1
that	1
outlandish	1
prophet	1
of	1
the	1
wharves.	1
But	1
whatever	1
it	1
was	1
of	1
apprehensiveness	1
or	1
uneasiness--to	1
call	1
it	1
so--which	1
I	1
felt,	1
yet	1
whenever	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
look	1
about	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
ship,	1
it	1
seemed	1
against	1
all	1
warrantry	1
to	1
cherish	1
such	1
emotions.	1
For	1
though	1
the	1
harpooneers,	1
with	1
the	1
great	1
body	1
of	1
the	1
crew,	1
were	1
a	1
far	1
more	1
barbaric,	1
heathenish,	1
and	1
motley	1
set	1
than	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
tame	1
merchant-ship	1
companies	1
which	1
my	1
previous	1
experiences	1
had	1
made	1
me	1
acquainted	1
with,	1
still	1
I	1
ascribed	1
this--and	1
rightly	1
ascribed	1
it--to	1
the	1
fierce	1
uniqueness	1
of	1
the	1
very	1
nature	1
of	1
that	1
wild	1
Scandinavian	1
vocation	1
in	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
so	1
abandonedly	1
embarked.	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
especially	1
the	1
aspect	1
of	1
the	1
three	1
chief	1
officers	1
of	1
the	1
ship,	1
the	1
mates,	1
which	1
was	1
most	1
forcibly	1
calculated	1
to	1
allay	1
these	1
colourless	1
misgivings,	1
and	1
induce	1
confidence	1
and	1
cheerfulness	1
in	1
every	1
presentment	1
of	1
the	1
voyage.	1
Three	1
better,	1
more	1
likely	1
sea-officers	1
and	1
men,	1
each	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
different	1
way,	1
could	1
not	1
readily	1
be	1
found,	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
Americans;	1
a	1
Nantucketer,	1
a	1
Vineyarder,	1
a	1
Cape	1
man.	1
Now,	1
it	1
being	1
Christmas	1
when	1
the	1
ship	1
shot	1
from	1
out	1
her	1
harbor,	1
for	1
a	1
space	1
we	1
had	1
biting	1
Polar	1
weather,	1
though	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
running	1
away	1
from	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
southward;	1
and	1
by	1
every	1
degree	1
and	1
minute	1
of	1
latitude	1
which	1
we	1
sailed,	1
gradually	1
leaving	1
that	1
merciless	1
winter,	1
and	1
all	1
its	1
intolerable	1
weather	1
behind	1
us.	1
It	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
less	1
lowering,	1
but	1
still	1
grey	1
and	1
gloomy	1
enough	1
mornings	1
of	1
the	1
transition,	1
when	1
with	1
a	1
fair	1
wind	1
the	1
ship	1
was	1
rushing	1
through	1
the	1
water	1
with	1
a	1
vindictive	1
sort	1
of	1
leaping	1
and	1
melancholy	1
rapidity,	1
that	1
as	1
I	1
mounted	1
to	1
the	1
deck	1
at	1
the	1
call	1
of	1
the	1
forenoon	1
watch,	1
so	1
soon	1
as	1
I	1
levelled	1
my	1
glance	1
towards	1
the	1
taffrail,	1
foreboding	1
shivers	1
ran	1
over	1
me.	1
Reality	1
outran	1
apprehension;	1
Captain	1
Ahab	1
stood	1
upon	1
his	1
quarter-deck.	1
There	1
seemed	1
no	1
sign	1
of	1
common	1
bodily	1
illness	1
about	1
him,	1
nor	1
of	1
the	1
recovery	1
from	1
any.	1
He	1
looked	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
cut	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
stake,	1
when	1
the	1
fire	1
has	1
overrunningly	1
wasted	1
all	1
the	1
limbs	1
without	1
consuming	1
them,	1
or	1
taking	1
away	1
one	1
particle	1
from	1
their	1
compacted	1
aged	1
robustness.	1
His	1
whole	1
high,	1
broad	1
form,	1
seemed	1
made	1
of	1
solid	1
bronze,	1
and	1
shaped	1
in	1
an	1
unalterable	1
mould,	1
like	1
Cellini's	1
cast	1
Perseus.	1
Threading	1
its	1
way	1
out	1
from	1
among	1
his	1
grey	1
hairs,	1
and	1
continuing	1
right	1
down	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
his	1
tawny	1
scorched	1
face	1
and	1
neck,	1
till	1
it	1
disappeared	1
in	1
his	1
clothing,	1
you	1
saw	1
a	1
slender	1
rod-like	1
mark,	1
lividly	1
whitish.	1
It	1
resembled	1
that	1
perpendicular	1
seam	1
sometimes	1
made	1
in	1
the	1
straight,	1
lofty	1
trunk	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
tree,	1
when	1
the	1
upper	1
lightning	1
tearingly	1
darts	1
down	1
it,	1
and	1
without	1
wrenching	1
a	1
single	1
twig,	1
peels	1
and	1
grooves	1
out	1
the	1
bark	1
from	1
top	1
to	1
bottom,	1
ere	1
running	1
off	1
into	1
the	1
soil,	1
leaving	1
the	1
tree	1
still	1
greenly	1
alive,	1
but	1
branded.	1
Whether	1
that	1
mark	1
was	1
born	1
with	1
him,	1
or	1
whether	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
scar	1
left	1
by	1
some	1
desperate	1
wound,	1
no	1
one	1
could	1
certainly	1
say.	1
By	1
some	1
tacit	1
consent,	1
throughout	1
the	1
voyage	1
little	1
or	1
no	1
allusion	1
was	1
made	1
to	1
it,	1
especially	1
by	1
the	1
mates.	1
But	1
once	1
Tashtego's	1
senior,	1
an	1
old	1
Gay-Head	1
Indian	1
among	1
the	1
crew,	1
superstitiously	1
asserted	1
that	1
not	1
till	1
he	1
was	1
full	1
forty	1
years	1
old	1
did	1
Ahab	1
become	1
that	1
way	1
branded,	1
and	1
then	1
it	1
came	1
upon	1
him,	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
fury	1
of	1
any	1
mortal	1
fray,	1
but	1
in	1
an	1
elemental	1
strife	1
at	1
sea.	1
Yet,	1
this	1
wild	1
hint	1
seemed	1
inferentially	1
negatived,	1
by	1
what	1
a	1
grey	1
Manxman	1
insinuated,	1
an	1
old	1
sepulchral	1
man,	1
who,	1
having	1
never	1
before	1
sailed	1
out	1
of	1
Nantucket,	1
had	1
never	1
ere	1
this	1
laid	1
eye	1
upon	1
wild	1
Ahab.	1
Nevertheless,	1
the	1
old	1
sea-traditions,	1
the	1
immemorial	1
credulities,	1
popularly	1
invested	1
this	1
old	1
Manxman	1
with	1
preternatural	1
powers	1
of	1
discernment.	1
So	1
that	1
no	1
white	1
sailor	1
seriously	1
contradicted	1
him	1
when	1
he	1
said	1
that	1
if	1
ever	1
Captain	1
Ahab	1
should	1
be	1
tranquilly	1
laid	1
out--which	1
might	1
hardly	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
so	1
he	1
muttered--then,	1
whoever	1
should	1
do	1
that	1
last	1
office	1
for	1
the	1
dead,	1
would	1
find	1
a	1
birth-mark	1
on	1
him	1
from	1
crown	1
to	1
sole.	1
So	1
powerfully	1
did	1
the	1
whole	1
grim	1
aspect	1
of	1
Ahab	1
affect	1
me,	1
and	1
the	1
livid	1
brand	1
which	1
streaked	1
it,	1
that	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
few	1
moments	1
I	1
hardly	1
noted	1
that	1
not	1
a	1
little	1
of	1
this	1
overbearing	1
grimness	1
was	1
owing	1
to	1
the	1
barbaric	1
white	1
leg	1
upon	1
which	1
he	1
partly	1
stood.	1
It	1
had	1
previously	1
come	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
this	1
ivory	1
leg	1
had	1
at	1
sea	1
been	1
fashioned	1
from	1
the	1
polished	1
bone	1
of	1
the	1
sperm	1
whale's	1
jaw.	1
"Aye,	1
he	1
was	1
dismasted	1
off	1
Japan,"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
Gay-Head	1
Indian	1
once;	1
"but	1
like	1
his	1
dismasted	1
craft,	1
he	1
shipped	1
another	1
mast	1
without	1
coming	1
home	1
for	1
it.	1
He	1
has	1
a	1
quiver	1
of	1
'em."	1
I	1
was	1
struck	1
with	1
the	1
singular	1
posture	1
he	1
maintained.	1
Upon	1
each	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
Pequod's	1
quarter	1
deck,	1
and	1
pretty	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
mizzen	1
shrouds,	1
there	1
was	1
an	1
auger	1
hole,	1
bored	1
about	1
half	1
an	1
inch	1
or	1
so,	1
into	1
the	1
plank.	1
His	1
bone	1
leg	1
steadied	1
in	1
that	1
hole;	1
one	1
arm	1
elevated,	1
and	1
holding	1
by	1
a	1
shroud;	1
Captain	1
Ahab	1
stood	1
erect,	1
looking	1
straight	1
out	1
beyond	1
the	1
ship's	1
ever-pitching	1
prow.	1
There	1
was	1
an	1
infinity	1
of	1
firmest	1
fortitude,	1
a	1
determinate,	1
unsurrenderable	1
wilfulness,	1
in	1
the	1
fixed	1
and	1
fearless,	1
forward	1
dedication	1
of	1
that	1
glance.	1
Not	1
a	1
word	1
he	1
spoke;	1
nor	1
did	1
his	1
officers	1
say	1
aught	1
to	1
him;	1
though	1
by	1
all	1
their	1
minutest	1
gestures	1
and	1
expressions,	1
they	1
plainly	1
showed	1
the	1
uneasy,	1
if	1
not	1
painful,	1
consciousness	1
of	1
being	1
under	1
a	1
troubled	1
master-eye.	1
And	1
not	1
only	1
that,	1
but	1
moody	1
stricken	1
Ahab	1
stood	1
before	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
crucifixion	1
in	1
his	1
face;	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
nameless	1
regal	1
overbearing	1
dignity	1
of	1
some	1
mighty	1
woe.	1
Ere	1
long,	1
from	1
his	1
first	1
visit	1
in	1
the	1
air,	1
he	1
withdrew	1
into	1
his	1
cabin.	1
But	1
after	1
that	1
morning,	1
he	1
was	1
every	1
day	1
visible	1
to	1
the	1
crew;	1
either	1
standing	1
in	1
his	1
pivot-hole,	1
or	1
seated	1
upon	1
an	1
ivory	1
stool	1
he	1
had;	1
or	1
heavily	1
walking	1
the	1
deck.	1
As	1
the	1
sky	1
grew	1
less	1
gloomy;	1
indeed,	1
began	1
to	1
grow	1
a	1
little	1
genial,	1
he	1
became	1
still	1
less	1
and	1
less	1
a	1
recluse;	1
as	1
if,	1
when	1
the	1
ship	1
had	1
sailed	1
from	1
home,	1
nothing	1
but	1
the	1
dead	1
wintry	1
bleakness	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
had	1
then	1
kept	1
him	1
so	1
secluded.	1
And,	1
by	1
and	1
by,	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
almost	1
continually	1
in	1
the	1
air;	1
but,	1
as	1
yet,	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
said,	1
or	1
perceptibly	1
did,	1
on	1
the	1
at	1
last	1
sunny	1
deck,	1
he	1
seemed	1
as	1
unnecessary	1
there	1
as	1
another	1
mast.	1
But	1
the	1
Pequod	1
was	1
only	1
making	1
a	1
passage	1
now;	1
not	1
regularly	1
cruising;	1
nearly	1
all	1
whaling	1
preparatives	1
needing	1
supervision	1
the	1
mates	1
were	1
fully	1
competent	1
to,	1
so	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
little	1
or	1
nothing,	1
out	1
of	1
himself,	1
to	1
employ	1
or	1
excite	1
Ahab,	1
now;	1
and	1
thus	1
chase	1
away,	1
for	1
that	1
one	1
interval,	1
the	1
clouds	1
that	1
layer	1
upon	1
layer	1
were	1
piled	1
upon	1
his	1
brow,	1
as	1
ever	1
all	1
clouds	1
choose	1
the	1
loftiest	1
peaks	1
to	1
pile	1
themselves	1
upon.	1
Nevertheless,	1
ere	1
long,	1
the	1
warm,	1
warbling	1
persuasiveness	1
of	1
the	1
pleasant,	1
holiday	1
weather	1
we	1
came	1
to,	1
seemed	1
gradually	1
to	1
charm	1
him	1
from	1
his	1
mood.	1
For,	1
as	1
when	1
the	1
red-cheeked,	1
dancing	1
girls,	1
April	1
and	1
May,	1
trip	1
home	1
to	1
the	1
wintry,	1
misanthropic	1
woods;	1
even	1
the	1
barest,	1
ruggedest,	1
most	1
thunder-cloven	1
old	1
oak	1
will	1
at	1
least	1
send	1
forth	1
some	1
few	1
green	1
sprouts,	1
to	1
welcome	1
such	1
glad-hearted	1
visitants;	1
so	1
Ahab	1
did,	1
in	1
the	1
end,	1
a	1
little	1
respond	1
to	1
the	1
playful	1
allurings	1
of	1
that	1
girlish	1
air.	1
More	1
than	1
once	1
did	1
he	1
put	1
forth	1
the	1
faint	1
blossom	1
of	1
a	1
look,	1
which,	1
in	1
any	1
other	1
man,	1
would	1
have	1
soon	1
flowered	1
out	1
in	1
a	1
smile.	1
CHAPTER	1
29	1
Enter	1
Ahab;	1
to	1
Him,	1
Stubb.	1
Some	1
days	1
elapsed,	1
and	1
ice	1
and	1
icebergs	1
all	1
astern,	1
the	1
Pequod	1
now	1
went	1
rolling	1
through	1
the	1
bright	1
Quito	1
spring,	1
which,	1
at	1
sea,	1
almost	1
perpetually	1
reigns	1
on	1
the	1
threshold	1
of	1
the	1
eternal	1
August	1
of	1
the	1
Tropic.	1
The	1
warmly	1
cool,	1
clear,	1
ringing,	1
perfumed,	1
overflowing,	1
redundant	1
days,	1
were	1
as	1
crystal	1
goblets	1
of	1
Persian	1
sherbet,	1
heaped	1
up--flaked	1
up,	1
with	1
rose-water	1
snow.	1
The	1
starred	1
and	1
stately	1
nights	1
seemed	1
haughty	1
dames	1
in	1
jewelled	1
velvets,	1
nursing	1
at	1
home	1
in	1
lonely	1
pride,	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
their	1
absent	1
conquering	1
Earls,	1
the	1
golden	1
helmeted	1
suns!	1
For	1
sleeping	1
man,	1
'twas	1
hard	1
to	1
choose	1
between	1
such	1
winsome	1
days	1
and	1
such	1
seducing	1
nights.	1
But	1
all	1
the	1
witcheries	1
of	1
that	1
unwaning	1
weather	1
did	1
not	1
merely	1
lend	1
new	1
spells	1
and	1
potencies	1
to	1
the	1
outward	1
world.	1
Inward	1
they	1
turned	1
upon	1
the	1
soul,	1
especially	1
when	1
the	1
still	1
mild	1
hours	1
of	1
eve	1
came	1
on;	1
then,	1
memory	1
shot	1
her	1
crystals	1
as	1
the	1
clear	1
ice	1
most	1
forms	1
of	1
noiseless	1
twilights.	1
And	1
all	1
these	1
subtle	1
agencies,	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
they	1
wrought	1
on	1
Ahab's	1
texture.	1
Old	1
age	1
is	1
always	1
wakeful;	1
as	1
if,	1
the	1
longer	1
linked	1
with	1
life,	1
the	1
less	1
man	1
has	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
aught	1
that	1
looks	1
like	1
death.	1
Among	1
sea-commanders,	1
the	1
old	1
greybeards	1
will	1
oftenest	1
leave	1
their	1
berths	1
to	1
visit	1
the	1
night-cloaked	1
deck.	1
It	1
was	1
so	1
with	1
Ahab;	1
only	1
that	1
now,	1
of	1
late,	1
he	1
seemed	1
so	1
much	1
to	1
live	1
in	1
the	1
open	1
air,	1
that	1
truly	1
speaking,	1
his	1
visits	1
were	1
more	1
to	1
the	1
cabin,	1
than	1
from	1
the	1
cabin	1
to	1
the	1
planks.	1
"It	1
feels	1
like	1
going	1
down	1
into	1
one's	1
tomb,"--he	1
would	1
mutter	1
to	1
himself--"for	1
an	1
old	1
captain	1
like	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
descending	1
this	1
narrow	1
scuttle,	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
my	1
grave-dug	1
berth."	1
So,	1
almost	1
every	1
twenty-four	1
hours,	1
when	1
the	1
watches	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
were	1
set,	1
and	1
the	1
band	1
on	1
deck	1
sentinelled	1
the	1
slumbers	1
of	1
the	1
band	1
below;	1
and	1
when	1
if	1
a	1
rope	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
hauled	1
upon	1
the	1
forecastle,	1
the	1
sailors	1
flung	1
it	1
not	1
rudely	1
down,	1
as	1
by	1
day,	1
but	1
with	1
some	1
cautiousness	1
dropt	1
it	1
to	1
its	1
place	1
for	1
fear	1
of	1
disturbing	1
their	1
slumbering	1
shipmates;	1
when	1
this	1
sort	1
of	1
steady	1
quietude	1
would	1
begin	1
to	1
prevail,	1
habitually,	1
the	1
silent	1
steersman	1
would	1
watch	1
the	1
cabin-scuttle;	1
and	1
ere	1
long	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
would	1
emerge,	1
gripping	1
at	1
the	1
iron	1
banister,	1
to	1
help	1
his	1
crippled	1
way.	1
Some	1
considering	1
touch	1
of	1
humanity	1
was	1
in	1
him;	1
for	1
at	1
times	1
like	1
these,	1
he	1
usually	1
abstained	1
from	1
patrolling	1
the	1
quarter-deck;	1
because	1
to	1
his	1
wearied	1
mates,	1
seeking	1
repose	1
within	1
six	1
inches	1
of	1
his	1
ivory	1
heel,	1
such	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
reverberating	1
crack	1
and	1
din	1
of	1
that	1
bony	1
step,	1
that	1
their	1
dreams	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
on	1
the	1
crunching	1
teeth	1
of	1
sharks.	1
But	1
once,	1
the	1
mood	1
was	1
on	1
him	1
too	1
deep	1
for	1
common	1
regardings;	1
and	1
as	1
with	1
heavy,	1
lumber-like	1
pace	1
he	1
was	1
measuring	1
the	1
ship	1
from	1
taffrail	1
to	1
mainmast,	1
Stubb,	1
the	1
old	1
second	1
mate,	1
came	1
up	1
from	1
below,	1
with	1
a	1
certain	1
unassured,	1
deprecating	1
humorousness,	1
hinted	1
that	1
if	1
Captain	1
Ahab	1
was	1
pleased	1
to	1
walk	1
the	1
planks,	1
then,	1
no	1
one	1
could	1
say	1
nay;	1
but	1
there	1
might	1
be	1
some	1
way	1
of	1
muffling	1
the	1
noise;	1
hinting	1
something	1
indistinctly	1
and	1
hesitatingly	1
about	1
a	1
globe	1
of	1
tow,	1
and	1
the	1
insertion	1
into	1
it,	1
of	1
the	1
ivory	1
heel.	1
Ah!	1
Stubb,	1
thou	1
didst	1
not	1
know	1
Ahab	1
then.	1
"Am	1
I	1
a	1
cannon-ball,	1
Stubb,"	1
said	1
Ahab,	1
"that	1
thou	1
wouldst	1
wad	1
me	1
that	1
fashion?	1
But	1
go	1
thy	1
ways;	1
I	1
had	1
forgot.	1
Below	1
to	1
thy	1
nightly	1
grave;	1
where	1
such	1
as	1
ye	1
sleep	1
between	1
shrouds,	1
to	1
use	1
ye	1
to	1
the	1
filling	1
one	1
at	1
last.--Down,	1
dog,	1
and	1
kennel!"	1
Starting	1
at	1
the	1
unforseen	1
concluding	1
exclamation	1
of	1
the	1
so	1
suddenly	1
scornful	1
old	1
man,	1
Stubb	1
was	1
speechless	1
a	1
moment;	1
then	1
said	1
excitedly,	1
"I	1
am	1
not	1
used	1
to	1
be	1
spoken	1
to	1
that	1
way,	1
sir;	1
I	1
do	1
but	1
less	1
than	1
half	1
like	1
it,	1
sir."	1
"Avast!	1
gritted	1
Ahab	1
between	1
his	1
set	1
teeth,	1
and	1
violently	1
moving	1
away,	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
avoid	1
some	1
passionate	1
temptation.	1
"No,	1
sir;	1
not	1
yet,"	1
said	1
Stubb,	1
emboldened,	1
"I	1
will	1
not	1
tamely	1
be	1
called	1
a	1
dog,	1
sir."	1
"Then	1
be	1
called	1
ten	1
times	1
a	1
donkey,	1
and	1
a	1
mule,	1
and	1
an	1
ass,	1
and	1
begone,	1
or	1
I'll	1
clear	1
the	1
world	1
of	1
thee!"	1
As	1
he	1
said	1
this,	1
Ahab	1
advanced	1
upon	1
him	1
with	1
such	1
overbearing	1
terrors	1
in	1
his	1
aspect,	1
that	1
Stubb	1
involuntarily	1
retreated.	1
"I	1
was	1
never	1
served	1
so	1
before	1
without	1
giving	1
a	1
hard	1
blow	1
for	1
it,"	1
muttered	1
Stubb,	1
as	1
he	1
found	1
himself	1
descending	1
the	1
cabin-scuttle.	1
"It's	1
very	1
queer.	1
Stop,	1
Stubb;	1
somehow,	1
now,	1
I	1
don't	1
well	1
know	1
whether	1
to	1
go	1
back	1
and	1
strike	1
him,	1
or--what's	1
that?--down	1
here	1
on	1
my	1
knees	1
and	1
pray	1
for	1
him?	1
Yes,	1
that	1
was	1
the	1
thought	1
coming	1
up	1
in	1
me;	1
but	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
I	1
ever	1
DID	1
pray.	1
It's	1
queer;	1
very	1
queer;	1
and	1
he's	1
queer	1
too;	1
aye,	1
take	1
him	1
fore	1
and	1
aft,	1
he's	1
about	1
the	1
queerest	1
old	1
man	1
Stubb	1
ever	1
sailed	1
with.	1
How	1
he	1
flashed	1
at	1
me!--his	1
eyes	1
like	1
powder-pans!	1
is	1
he	1
mad?	1
Anyway	1
there's	1
something	1
on	1
his	1
mind,	1
as	1
sure	1
as	1
there	1
must	1
be	1
something	1
on	1
a	1
deck	1
when	1
it	1
cracks.	1
He	1
aint	1
in	1
his	1
bed	1
now,	1
either,	1
more	1
than	1
three	1
hours	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
twenty-four;	1
and	1
he	1
don't	1
sleep	1
then.	1
Didn't	1
that	1
Dough-Boy,	1
the	1
steward,	1
tell	1
me	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
morning	1
he	1
always	1
finds	1
the	1
old	1
man's	1
hammock	1
clothes	1
all	1
rumpled	1
and	1
tumbled,	1
and	1
the	1
sheets	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
foot,	1
and	1
the	1
coverlid	1
almost	1
tied	1
into	1
knots,	1
and	1
the	1
pillow	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
frightful	1
hot,	1
as	1
though	1
a	1
baked	1
brick	1
had	1
been	1
on	1
it?	1
A	1
hot	1
old	1
man!	1
I	1
guess	1
he's	1
got	1
what	1
some	1
folks	1
ashore	1
call	1
a	1
conscience;	1
it's	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
Tic-Dolly-row	1
they	1
say--worse	1
nor	1
a	1
toothache.	1
Well,	1
well;	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
what	1
it	1
is,	1
but	1
the	1
Lord	1
keep	1
me	1
from	1
catching	1
it.	1
He's	1
full	1
of	1
riddles;	1
I	1
wonder	1
what	1
he	1
goes	1
into	1
the	1
after	1
hold	1
for,	1
every	1
night,	1
as	1
Dough-Boy	1
tells	1
me	1
he	1
suspects;	1
what's	1
that	1
for,	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
know?	1
Who's	1
made	1
appointments	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
hold?	1
Ain't	1
that	1
queer,	1
now?	1
But	1
there's	1
no	1
telling,	1
it's	1
the	1
old	1
game--Here	1
goes	1
for	1
a	1
snooze.	1
Damn	1
me,	1
it's	1
worth	1
a	1
fellow's	1
while	1
to	1
be	1
born	1
into	1
the	1
world,	1
if	1
only	1
to	1
fall	1
right	1
asleep.	1
And	1
now	1
that	1
I	1
think	1
of	1
it,	1
that's	1
about	1
the	1
first	1
thing	1
babies	1
do,	1
and	1
that's	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
queer,	1
too.	1
Damn	1
me,	1
but	1
all	1
things	1
are	1
queer,	1
come	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
'em.	1
But	1
that's	1
against	1
my	1
principles.	1
Think	1
not,	1
is	1
my	1
eleventh	1
commandment;	1
and	1
sleep	1
when	1
you	1
can,	1
is	1
my	1
twelfth--So	1
here	1
goes	1
again.	1
But	1
how's	1
that?	1
didn't	1
he	1
call	1
me	1
a	1
dog?	1
blazes!	1
he	1
called	1
me	1
ten	1
times	1
a	1
donkey,	1
and	1
piled	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
jackasses	1
on	1
top	1
of	1
THAT!	1
He	1
might	1
as	1
well	1
have	1
kicked	1
me,	1
and	1
done	1
with	1
it.	1
Maybe	1
he	1
DID	1
kick	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
didn't	1
observe	1
it,	1
I	1
was	1
so	1
taken	1
all	1
aback	1
with	1
his	1
brow,	1
somehow.	1
It	1
flashed	1
like	1
a	1
bleached	1
bone.	1
What	1
the	1
devil's	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
me?	1
I	1
don't	1
stand	1
right	1
on	1
my	1
legs.	1
Coming	1
afoul	1
of	1
that	1
old	1
man	1
has	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
turned	1
me	1
wrong	1
side	1
out.	1
By	1
the	1
Lord,	1
I	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
dreaming,	1
though--How?	1
how?	1
how?--but	1
the	1
only	1
way's	1
to	1
stash	1
it;	1
so	1
here	1
goes	1
to	1
hammock	1
again;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
I'll	1
see	1
how	1
this	1
plaguey	1
juggling	1
thinks	1
over	1
by	1
daylight."	1
CHAPTER	1
30	1
The	1
Pipe.	1
When	1
Stubb	1
had	1
departed,	1
Ahab	1
stood	1
for	1
a	1
while	1
leaning	1
over	1
the	1
bulwarks;	1
and	1
then,	1
as	1
had	1
been	1
usual	1
with	1
him	1
of	1
late,	1
calling	1
a	1
sailor	1
of	1
the	1
watch,	1
he	1
sent	1
him	1
below	1
for	1
his	1
ivory	1
stool,	1
and	1
also	1
his	1
pipe.	1
Lighting	1
the	1
pipe	1
at	1
the	1
binnacle	1
lamp	1
and	1
planting	1
the	1
stool	1
on	1
the	1
weather	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
deck,	1
he	1
sat	1
and	1
smoked.	1
In	1
old	1
Norse	1
times,	1
the	1
thrones	1
of	1
the	1
sea-loving	1
Danish	1
kings	1
were	1
fabricated,	1
saith	1
tradition,	1
of	1
the	1
tusks	1
of	1
the	1
narwhale.	1
How	1
could	1
one	1
look	1
at	1
Ahab	1
then,	1
seated	1
on	1
that	1
tripod	1
of	1
bones,	1
without	1
bethinking	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
royalty	1
it	1
symbolized?	1
For	1
a	1
Khan	1
of	1
the	1
plank,	1
and	1
a	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
lord	1
of	1
Leviathans	1
was	1
Ahab.	1
Some	1
moments	1
passed,	1
during	1
which	1
the	1
thick	1
vapour	1
came	1
from	1
his	1
mouth	1
in	1
quick	1
and	1
constant	1
puffs,	1
which	1
blew	1
back	1
again	1
into	1
his	1
face.	1
"How	1
now,"	1
he	1
soliloquized	1
at	1
last,	1
withdrawing	1
the	1
tube,	1
"this	1
smoking	1
no	1
longer	1
soothes.	1
Oh,	1
my	1
pipe!	1
hard	1
must	1
it	1
go	1
with	1
me	1
if	1
thy	1
charm	1
be	1
gone!	1
Here	1
have	1
I	1
been	1
unconsciously	1
toiling,	1
not	1
pleasuring--aye,	1
and	1
ignorantly	1
smoking	1
to	1
windward	1
all	1
the	1
while;	1
to	1
windward,	1
and	1
with	1
such	1
nervous	1
whiffs,	1
as	1
if,	1
like	1
the	1
dying	1
whale,	1
my	1
final	1
jets	1
were	1
the	1
strongest	1
and	1
fullest	1
of	1
trouble.	1
What	1
business	1
have	1
I	1
with	1
this	1
pipe?	1
This	1
thing	1
that	1
is	1
meant	1
for	1
sereneness,	1
to	1
send	1
up	1
mild	1
white	1
vapours	1
among	1
mild	1
white	1
hairs,	1
not	1
among	1
torn	1
iron-grey	1
locks	1
like	1
mine.	1
I'll	1
smoke	1
no	1
more--"	1
He	1
tossed	1
the	1
still	1
lighted	1
pipe	1
into	1
the	1
sea.	1
The	1
fire	1
hissed	1
in	1
the	1
waves;	1
the	1
same	1
instant	1
the	1
ship	1
shot	1
by	1
the	1
bubble	1
the	1
sinking	1
pipe	1
made.	1
With	1
slouched	1
hat,	1
Ahab	1
lurchingly	1
paced	1
the	1
planks.	1
CHAPTER	1
31	1
Queen	1
Mab.	1
Next	1
morning	1
Stubb	1
accosted	1
Flask.	1
"Such	1
a	1
queer	1
dream,	1
King-Post,	1
I	1
never	1
had.	1
You	1
know	1
the	1
old	1
man's	1
ivory	1
leg,	1
well	1
I	1
dreamed	1
he	1
kicked	1
me	1
with	1
it;	1
and	1
when	1
I	1
tried	1
to	1
kick	1
back,	1
upon	1
my	1
soul,	1
my	1
little	1
man,	1
I	1
kicked	1
my	1
leg	1
right	1
off!	1
And	1
then,	1
presto!	1
Ahab	1
seemed	1
a	1
pyramid,	1
and	1
I,	1
like	1
a	1
blazing	1
fool,	1
kept	1
kicking	1
at	1
it.	1
But	1
what	1
was	1
still	1
more	1
curious,	1
Flask--you	1
know	1
how	1
curious	1
all	1
dreams	1
are--through	1
all	1
this	1
rage	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
in,	1
I	1
somehow	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
thinking	1
to	1
myself,	1
that	1
after	1
all,	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
much	1
of	1
an	1
insult,	1
that	1
kick	1
from	1
Ahab.	1
'Why,'	1
thinks	1
I,	1
'what's	1
the	1
row?	1
It's	1
not	1
a	1
real	1
leg,	1
only	1
a	1
false	1
leg.'	1
And	1
there's	1
a	1
mighty	1
difference	1
between	1
a	1
living	1
thump	1
and	1
a	1
dead	1
thump.	1
That's	1
what	1
makes	1
a	1
blow	1
from	1
the	1
hand,	1
Flask,	1
fifty	1
times	1
more	1
savage	1
to	1
bear	1
than	1
a	1
blow	1
from	1
a	1
cane.	1
The	1
living	1
member--that	1
makes	1
the	1
living	1
insult,	1
my	1
little	1
man.	1
And	1
thinks	1
I	1
to	1
myself	1
all	1
the	1
while,	1
mind,	1
while	1
I	1
was	1
stubbing	1
my	1
silly	1
toes	1
against	1
that	1
cursed	1
pyramid--so	1
confoundedly	1
contradictory	1
was	1
it	1
all,	1
all	1
the	1
while,	1
I	1
say,	1
I	1
was	1
thinking	1
to	1
myself,	1
'what's	1
his	1
leg	1
now,	1
but	1
a	1
cane--a	1
whalebone	1
cane.	1
Yes,'	1
thinks	1
I,	1
'it	1
was	1
only	1
a	1
playful	1
cudgelling--in	1
fact,	1
only	1
a	1
whaleboning	1
that	1
he	1
gave	1
me--not	1
a	1
base	1
kick.	1
Besides,'	1
thinks	1
I,	1
'look	1
at	1
it	1
once;	1
why,	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
it--the	1
foot	1
part--what	1
a	1
small	1
sort	1
of	1
end	1
it	1
is;	1
whereas,	1
if	1
a	1
broad	1
footed	1
farmer	1
kicked	1
me,	1
THERE'S	1
a	1
devilish	1
broad	1
insult.	1
But	1
this	1
insult	1
is	1
whittled	1
down	1
to	1
a	1
point	1
only.'	1
But	1
now	1
comes	1
the	1
greatest	1
joke	1
of	1
the	1
dream,	1
Flask.	1
While	1
I	1
was	1
battering	1
away	1
at	1
the	1
pyramid,	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
badger-haired	1
old	1
merman,	1
with	1
a	1
hump	1
on	1
his	1
back,	1
takes	1
me	1
by	1
the	1
shoulders,	1
and	1
slews	1
me	1
round.	1
'What	1
are	1
you	1
'bout?'	1
says	1
he.	1
Slid!	1
man,	1
but	1
I	1
was	1
frightened.	1
Such	1
a	1
phiz!	1
But,	1
somehow,	1
next	1
moment	1
I	1
was	1
over	1
the	1
fright.	1
'What	1
am	1
I	1
about?'	1
says	1
I	1
at	1
last.	1
'And	1
what	1
business	1
is	1
that	1
of	1
yours,	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
know,	1
Mr.	1
Humpback?	1
Do	1
YOU	1
want	1
a	1
kick?'	1
By	1
the	1
lord,	1
Flask,	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
sooner	1
said	1
that,	1
than	1
he	1
turned	1
round	1
his	1
stern	1
to	1
me,	1
bent	1
over,	1
and	1
dragging	1
up	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
seaweed	1
he	1
had	1
for	1
a	1
clout--what	1
do	1
you	1
think,	1
I	1
saw?--why	1
thunder	1
alive,	1
man,	1
his	1
stern	1
was	1
stuck	1
full	1
of	1
marlinspikes,	1
with	1
the	1
points	1
out.	1
Says	1
I,	1
on	1
second	1
thoughts,	1
'I	1
guess	1
I	1
won't	1
kick	1
you,	1
old	1
fellow.'	1
'Wise	1
Stubb,'	1
said	1
he,	1
'wise	1
Stubb;'	1
and	1
kept	1
muttering	1
it	1
all	1
the	1
time,	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
eating	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
gums	1
like	1
a	1
chimney	1
hag.	1
Seeing	1
he	1
wasn't	1
going	1
to	1
stop	1
saying	1
over	1
his	1
'wise	1
Stubb,	1
wise	1
Stubb,'	1
I	1
thought	1
I	1
might	1
as	1
well	1
fall	1
to	1
kicking	1
the	1
pyramid	1
again.	1
But	1
I	1
had	1
only	1
just	1
lifted	1
my	1
foot	1
for	1
it,	1
when	1
he	1
roared	1
out,	1
'Stop	1
that	1
kicking!'	1
'Halloa,'	1
says	1
I,	1
'what's	1
the	1
matter	1
now,	1
old	1
fellow?'	1
'Look	1
ye	1
here,'	1
says	1
he;	1
'let's	1
argue	1
the	1
insult.	1
Captain	1
Ahab	1
kicked	1
ye,	1
didn't	1
he?'	1
'Yes,	1
he	1
did,'	1
says	1
I--'right	1
HERE	1
it	1
was.'	1
'Very	1
good,'	1
says	1
he--'he	1
used	1
his	1
ivory	1
leg,	1
didn't	1
he?'	1
'Yes,	1
he	1
did,'	1
says	1
I.	1
'Well	1
then,'	1
says	1
he,	1
'wise	1
Stubb,	1
what	1
have	1
you	1
to	1
complain	1
of?	1
Didn't	1
he	1
kick	1
with	1
right	1
good	1
will?	1
it	1
wasn't	1
a	1
common	1
pitch	1
pine	1
leg	1
he	1
kicked	1
with,	1
was	1
it?	1
No,	1
you	1
were	1
kicked	1
by	1
a	1
great	1
man,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
beautiful	1
ivory	1
leg,	1
Stubb.	1
It's	1
an	1
honour;	1
I	1
consider	1
it	1
an	1
honour.	1
Listen,	1
wise	1
Stubb.	1
In	1
old	1
England	1
the	1
greatest	1
lords	1
think	1
it	1
great	1
glory	1
to	1
be	1
slapped	1
by	1
a	1
queen,	1
and	1
made	1
garter-knights	1
of;	1
but,	1
be	1
YOUR	1
boast,	1
Stubb,	1
that	1
ye	1
were	1
kicked	1
by	1
old	1
Ahab,	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
wise	1
man	1
of.	1
Remember	1
what	1
I	1
say;	1
BE	1
kicked	1
by	1
him;	1
account	1
his	1
kicks	1
honours;	1
and	1
on	1
no	1
account	1
kick	1
back;	1
for	1
you	1
can't	1
help	1
yourself,	1
wise	1
Stubb.	1
Don't	1
you	1
see	1
that	1
pyramid?'	1
With	1
that,	1
he	1
all	1
of	1
a	1
sudden	1
seemed	1
somehow,	1
in	1
some	1
queer	1
fashion,	1
to	1
swim	1
off	1
into	1
the	1
air.	1
I	1
snored;	1
rolled	1
over;	1
and	1
there	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
my	1
hammock!	1
Now,	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
of	1
that	1
dream,	1
Flask?"	1
"I	1
don't	1
know;	1
it	1
seems	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
foolish	1
to	1
me,	1
tho.'"	1
"May	1
be;	1
may	1
be.	1
But	1
it's	1
made	1
a	1
wise	1
man	1
of	1
me,	1
Flask.	1
D'ye	1
see	1
Ahab	1
standing	1
there,	1
sideways	1
looking	1
over	1
the	1
stern?	1
Well,	1
the	1
best	1
thing	1
you	1
can	1
do,	1
Flask,	1
is	1
to	1
let	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
alone;	1
never	1
speak	1
to	1
him,	1
whatever	1
he	1
says.	1
Halloa!	1
What's	1
that	1
he	1
shouts?	1
Hark!"	1
"Mast-head,	1
there!	1
Look	1
sharp,	1
all	1
of	1
ye!	1
There	1
are	1
whales	1
hereabouts!	1
If	1
ye	1
see	1
a	1
white	1
one,	1
split	1
your	1
lungs	1
for	1
him!	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
of	1
that	1
now,	1
Flask?	1
ain't	1
there	1
a	1
small	1
drop	1
of	1
something	1
queer	1
about	1
that,	1
eh?	1
A	1
white	1
whale--did	1
ye	1
mark	1
that,	1
man?	1
Look	1
ye--there's	1
something	1
special	1
in	1
the	1
wind.	1
Stand	1
by	1
for	1
it,	1
Flask.	1
Ahab	1
has	1
that	1
that's	1
bloody	1
on	1
his	1
mind.	1
But,	1
mum;	1
he	1
comes	1
this	1
way."	1
CHAPTER	1
32	1
Cetology.	1
Already	1
we	1
are	1
boldly	1
launched	1
upon	1
the	1
deep;	1
but	1
soon	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
lost	1
in	1
its	1
unshored,	1
harbourless	1
immensities.	1
Ere	1
that	1
come	1
to	1
pass;	1
ere	1
the	1
Pequod's	1
weedy	1
hull	1
rolls	1
side	1
by	1
side	1
with	1
the	1
barnacled	1
hulls	1
of	1
the	1
leviathan;	1
at	1
the	1
outset	1
it	1
is	1
but	1
well	1
to	1
attend	1
to	1
a	1
matter	1
almost	1
indispensable	1
to	1
a	1
thorough	1
appreciative	1
understanding	1
of	1
the	1
more	1
special	1
leviathanic	1
revelations	1
and	1
allusions	1
of	1
all	1
sorts	1
which	1
are	1
to	1
follow.	1
It	1
is	1
some	1
systematized	1
exhibition	1
of	1
the	1
whale	1
in	1
his	1
broad	1
genera,	1
that	1
I	1
would	1
now	1
fain	1
put	1
before	1
you.	1
Yet	1
is	1
it	1
no	1
easy	1
task.	1
The	1
classification	1
of	1
the	1
constituents	1
of	1
a	1
chaos,	1
nothing	1
less	1
is	1
here	1
essayed.	1
Listen	1
to	1
what	1
the	1
best	1
and	1
latest	1
authorities	1
have	1
laid	1
down.	1
"No	1
branch	1
of	1
Zoology	1
is	1
so	1
much	1
involved	1
as	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
entitled	1
Cetology,"	1
says	1
Captain	1
Scoresby,	1
A.D.	1
1820.	1
"It	1
is	1
not	1
my	1
intention,	1
were	1
it	1
in	1
my	1
power,	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
inquiry	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
true	1
method	1
of	1
dividing	1
the	1
cetacea	1
into	1
groups	1
and	1
families....	1
Utter	1
confusion	1
exists	1
among	1
the	1
historians	1
of	1
this	1
animal"	1
(sperm	1
whale),	1
says	1
Surgeon	1
Beale,	1
A.D.	1
1839.	1
"Unfitness	1
to	1
pursue	1
our	1
research	1
in	1
the	1
unfathomable	1
waters."	1
"Impenetrable	1
veil	1
covering	1
our	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
cetacea."	1
"A	1
field	1
strewn	1
with	1
thorns."	1
"All	1
these	1
incomplete	1
indications	1
but	1
serve	1
to	1
torture	1
us	1
naturalists."	1
Thus	1
speak	1
of	1
the	1
whale,	1
the	1
great	1
Cuvier,	1
and	1
John	1
Hunter,	1
and	1
Lesson,	1
those	1
lights	1
of	1
zoology	1
and	1
anatomy.	1
Nevertheless,	1
though	1
of	1
real	1
knowledge	1
there	1
be	1
little,	1
yet	1
of	1
books	1
there	1
are	1
a	1
plenty;	1
and	1
so	1
in	1
some	1
small	1
degree,	1
with	1
cetology,	1
or	1
the	1
science	1
of	1
whales.	1
Many	1
are	1
the	1
men,	1
small	1
and	1
great,	1
old	1
and	1
new,	1
landsmen	1
and	1
seamen,	1
who	1
have	1
at	1
large	1
or	1
in	1
little,	1
written	1
of	1
the	1
whale.	1
Run	1
over	1
a	1
few:--The	1
Authors	1
of	1
the	1
Bible;	1
Aristotle;	1
Pliny;	1
Aldrovandi;	1
Sir	1
Thomas	1
Browne;	1
Gesner;	1
Ray;	1
Linnaeus;	1
Rondeletius;	1
Willoughby;	1
Green;	1
Artedi;	1
Sibbald;	1
Brisson;	1
Marten;	1
Lacepede;	1
Bonneterre;	1
Desmarest;	1
Baron	1
Cuvier;	1
Frederick	1
Cuvier;	1
John	1
Hunter;	1
Owen;	1
Scoresby;	1
Beale;	1
Bennett;	1
J.	1
Ross	1
Browne;	1
the	1
Author	1
of	1
Miriam	1
Coffin;	1
Olmstead;	1
and	1
the	1
Rev.	1
T.	1
Cheever.	1
But	1
to	1
what	1
ultimate	1
generalizing	1
purpose	1
all	1
these	1
have	1
written,	1
the	1
above	1
cited	1
extracts	1
will	1
show.	1
Of	1
the	1
names	1
in	1
this	1
list	1
of	1
whale	1
authors,	1
only	1
those	1
following	1
Owen	1
ever	1
saw	1
living	1
whales;	1
and	1
but	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
was	1
a	1
real	1
professional	1
harpooneer	1
and	1
whaleman.	1
I	1
mean	1
Captain	1
Scoresby.	1
On	1
the	1
separate	1
subject	1
of	1
the	1
Greenland	1
or	1
right-whale,	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
best	1
existing	1
authority.	1
But	1
Scoresby	1
knew	1
nothing	1
and	1
says	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
sperm	1
whale,	1
compared	1
with	1
which	1
the	1
Greenland	1
whale	1
is	1
almost	1
unworthy	1
mentioning.	1
And	1
here	1
be	1
it	1
said,	1
that	1
the	1
Greenland	1
whale	1
is	1
an	1
usurper	1
upon	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
the	1
seas.	1
He	1
is	1
not	1
even	1
by	1
any	1
means	1
the	1
largest	1
of	1
the	1
whales.	1
Yet,	1
owing	1
to	1
the	1
long	1
priority	1
of	1
his	1
claims,	1
and	1
the	1
profound	1
ignorance	1
which,	1
till	1
some	1
seventy	1
years	1
back,	1
invested	1
the	1
then	1
fabulous	1
or	1
utterly	1
unknown	1
sperm-whale,	1
and	1
which	1
ignorance	1
to	1
this	1
present	1
day	1
still	1
reigns	1
in	1
all	1
but	1
some	1
few	1
scientific	1
retreats	1
and	1
whale-ports;	1
this	1
usurpation	1
has	1
been	1
every	1
way	1
complete.	1
Reference	1
to	1
nearly	1
all	1
the	1
leviathanic	1
allusions	1
in	1
the	1
great	1
poets	1
of	1
past	1
days,	1
will	1
satisfy	1
you	1
that	1
the	1
Greenland	1
whale,	1
without	1
one	1
rival,	1
was	1
to	1
them	1
the	1
monarch	1
of	1
the	1
seas.	1
But	1
the	1
time	1
has	1
at	1
last	1
come	1
for	1
a	1
new	1
proclamation.	1
This	1
is	1
Charing	1
Cross;	1
hear	1
ye!	1
good	1
people	1
all,--the	1
Greenland	1
whale	1
is	1
deposed,--the	1
great	1
sperm	1
whale	1
now	1
reigneth!	1
There	1
are	1
only	1
two	1
books	1
in	1
being	1
which	1
at	1
all	1
pretend	1
to	1
put	1
the	1
living	1
sperm	1
whale	1
before	1
you,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
in	1
the	1
remotest	1
degree	1
succeed	1
in	1
the	1
attempt.	1
Those	1
books	1
are	1
Beale's	1
and	1
Bennett's;	1
both	1
in	1
their	1
time	1
surgeons	1
to	1
English	1
South-Sea	1
whale-ships,	1
and	1
both	1
exact	1
and	1
reliable	1
men.	1
The	1
original	1
matter	1
touching	1
the	1
sperm	1
whale	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
their	1
volumes	1
is	1
necessarily	1
small;	1
but	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
it	1
goes,	1
it	1
is	1
of	1
excellent	1
quality,	1
though	1
mostly	1
confined	1
to	1
scientific	1
description.	1
As	1
yet,	1
however,	1
the	1
sperm	1
whale,	1
scientific	1
or	1
poetic,	1
lives	1
not	1
complete	1
in	1
any	1
literature.	1
Far	1
above	1
all	1
other	1
hunted	1
whales,	1
his	1
is	1
an	1
unwritten	1
life.	1
Now	1
the	1
various	1
species	1
of	1
whales	1
need	1
some	1
sort	1
of	1
popular	1
comprehensive	1
classification,	1
if	1
only	1
an	1
easy	1
outline	1
one	1
for	1
the	1
present,	1
hereafter	1
to	1
be	1
filled	1
in	1
all	1
its	1
departments	1
by	1
subsequent	1
laborers.	1
As	1
no	1
better	1
man	1
advances	1
to	1
take	1
this	1
matter	1
in	1
hand,	1
I	1
hereupon	1
offer	1
my	1
own	1
poor	1
endeavors.	1
I	1
promise	1
nothing	1
complete;	1
because	1
any	1
human	1
thing	1
supposed	1
to	1
be	1
complete,	1
must	1
for	1
that	1
very	1
reason	1
infallibly	1
be	1
faulty.	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
pretend	1
to	1
a	1
minute	1
anatomical	1
description	1
of	1
the	1
various	1
species,	1
or--in	1
this	1
place	1
at	1
least--to	1
much	1
of	1
any	1
description.	1
My	1
object	1
here	1
is	1
simply	1
to	1
project	1
the	1
draught	1
of	1
a	1
systematization	1
of	1
cetology.	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
architect,	1
not	1
the	1
builder.	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
ponderous	1
task;	1
no	1
ordinary	1
letter-sorter	1
in	1
the	1
Post-Office	1
is	1
equal	1
to	1
it.	1
To	1
grope	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
after	1
them;	1
to	1
have	1
one's	1
hands	1
among	1
the	1
unspeakable	1
foundations,	1
ribs,	1
and	1
very	1
pelvis	1
of	1
the	1
world;	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
fearful	1
thing.	1
What	1
am	1
I	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
essay	1
to	1
hook	1
the	1
nose	1
of	1
this	1
leviathan!	1
The	1
awful	1
tauntings	1
in	1
Job	1
might	1
well	1
appal	1
me.	1
"Will	1
he	1
the	1
(leviathan)	1
make	1
a	1
covenant	1
with	1
thee?	1
Behold	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
him	1
is	1
vain!	1
But	1
I	1
have	1
swam	1
through	1
libraries	1
and	1
sailed	1
through	1
oceans;	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
whales	1
with	1
these	1
visible	1
hands;	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
earnest;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
try.	1
There	1
are	1
some	1
preliminaries	1
to	1
settle.	1
First:	1
The	1
uncertain,	1
unsettled	1
condition	1
of	1
this	1
science	1
of	1
Cetology	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
vestibule	1
attested	1
by	1
the	1
fact,	1
that	1
in	1
some	1
quarters	1
it	1
still	1
remains	1
a	1
moot	1
point	1
whether	1
a	1
whale	1
be	1
a	1
fish.	1
In	1
his	1
System	1
of	1
Nature,	1
A.D.	1
1776,	1
Linnaeus	1
declares,	1
"I	1
hereby	1
separate	1
the	1
whales	1
from	1
the	1
fish."	1
But	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
knowledge,	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
year	1
1850,	1
sharks	1
and	1
shad,	1
alewives	1
and	1
herring,	1
against	1
Linnaeus's	1
express	1
edict,	1
were	1
still	1
found	1
dividing	1
the	1
possession	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
seas	1
with	1
the	1
Leviathan.	1
The	1
grounds	1
upon	1
which	1
Linnaeus	1
would	1
fain	1
have	1
banished	1
the	1
whales	1
from	1
the	1
waters,	1
he	1
states	1
as	1
follows:	1
"On	1
account	1
of	1
their	1
warm	1
bilocular	1
heart,	1
their	1
lungs,	1
their	1
movable	1
eyelids,	1
their	1
hollow	1
ears,	1
penem	1
intrantem	1
feminam	1
mammis	1
lactantem,"	1
and	1
finally,	1
"ex	1
lege	1
naturae	1
jure	1
meritoque."	1
I	1
submitted	1
all	1
this	1
to	1
my	1
friends	1
Simeon	1
Macey	1
and	1
Charley	1
Coffin,	1
of	1
Nantucket,	1
both	1
messmates	1
of	1
mine	1
in	1
a	1
certain	1
voyage,	1
and	1
they	1
united	1
in	1
the	1
opinion	1
that	1
the	1
reasons	1
set	1
forth	1
were	1
altogether	1
insufficient.	1
Charley	1
profanely	1
hinted	1
they	1
were	1
humbug.	1
Be	1
it	1
known	1
that,	1
waiving	1
all	1
argument,	1
I	1
take	1
the	1
good	1
old	1
fashioned	1
ground	1
that	1
the	1
whale	1
is	1
a	1
fish,	1
and	1
call	1
upon	1
holy	1
Jonah	1
to	1
back	1
me.	1
This	1
fundamental	1
thing	1
settled,	1
the	1
next	1
point	1
is,	1
in	1
what	1
internal	1
respect	1
does	1
the	1
whale	1
differ	1
from	1
other	1
fish.	1
Above,	1
Linnaeus	1
has	1
given	1
you	1
those	1
items.	1
But	1
in	1
brief,	1
they	1
are	1
these:	1
lungs	1
and	1
warm	1
blood;	1
whereas,	1
all	1
other	1
fish	1
are	1
lungless	1
and	1
cold	1
blooded.	1
Next:	1
how	1
shall	1
we	1
define	1
the	1
whale,	1
by	1
his	1
obvious	1
externals,	1
so	1
as	1
conspicuously	1
to	1
label	1
him	1
for	1
all	1
time	1
to	1
come?	1
To	1
be	1
short,	1
then,	1
a	1
whale	1
is	1
A	1
SPOUTING	1
FISH	1
WITH	1
A	1
HORIZONTAL	1
TAIL.	1
There	1
you	1
have	1
him.	1
However	1
contracted,	1
that	1
definition	1
is	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
expanded	1
meditation.	1
A	1
walrus	1
spouts	1
much	1
like	1
a	1
whale,	1
but	1
the	1
walrus	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
fish,	1
because	1
he	1
is	1
amphibious.	1
But	1
the	1
last	1
term	1
of	1
the	1
definition	1
is	1
still	1
more	1
cogent,	1
as	1
coupled	1
with	1
the	1
first.	1
Almost	1
any	1
one	1
must	1
have	1
noticed	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
fish	1
familiar	1
to	1
landsmen	1
have	1
not	1
a	1
flat,	1
but	1
a	1
vertical,	1
or	1
up-and-down	1
tail.	1
Whereas,	1
among	1
spouting	1
fish	1
the	1
tail,	1
though	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
similarly	1
shaped,	1
invariably	1
assumes	1
a	1
horizontal	1
position.	1
By	1
the	1
above	1
definition	1
of	1
what	1
a	1
whale	1
is,	1
I	1
do	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
exclude	1
from	1
the	1
leviathanic	1
brotherhood	1
any	1
sea	1
creature	1
hitherto	1
identified	1
with	1
the	1
whale	1
by	1
the	1
best	1
informed	1
Nantucketers;	1
nor,	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
hand,	1
link	1
with	1
it	1
any	1
fish	1
hitherto	1
authoritatively	1
regarded	1
as	1
alien.*	1
Hence,	1
all	1
the	1
smaller,	1
spouting,	1
and	1
horizontal	1
tailed	1
fish	1
must	1
be	1
included	1
in	1
this	1
ground-plan	1
of	1
Cetology.	1
Now,	1
then,	1
come	1
the	1
grand	1
divisions	1
of	1
the	1
entire	1
whale	1
host.	1
*I	1
am	1
aware	1
that	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
present	1
time,	1
the	1
fish	1
styled	1
Lamatins	1
and	1
Dugongs	1
(Pig-fish	1
and	1
Sow-fish	1
of	1
the	1
Coffins	1
of	1
Nantucket)	1
are	1
included	1
by	1
many	1
naturalists	1
among	1
the	1
whales.	1
But	1
as	1
these	1
pig-fish	1
are	1
a	1
noisy,	1
contemptible	1
set,	1
mostly	1
lurking	1
in	1
the	1
mouths	1
of	1
rivers,	1
and	1
feeding	1
on	1
wet	1
hay,	1
and	1
especially	1
as	1
they	1
do	1
not	1
spout,	1
I	1
deny	1
their	1
credentials	1
as	1
whales;	1
and	1
have	1
presented	1
them	1
with	1
their	1
passports	1
to	1
quit	1
the	1
Kingdom	1
of	1
Cetology.	1
First:	1
According	1
to	1
magnitude	1
I	1
divide	1
the	1
whales	1
into	1
three	1
primary	1
BOOKS	1
(subdivisible	1
into	1
CHAPTERS),	1
and	1
these	1
shall	1
comprehend	1
them	1
all,	1
both	1
small	1
and	1
large.	1

CHAPTER	1
I.	1
(SPERM	1
WHALE).--This	1
whale,	1
among	1
the	1
English	1
of	1
old	1
vaguely	1
known	1
as	1
the	1
Trumpa	1
whale,	1
and	1
the	1
Physeter	1
whale,	1
and	1
the	1
Anvil	1
Headed	1
whale,	1
is	1
the	1
present	1
Cachalot	1
of	1
the	1
French,	1
and	1
the	1
Pottsfich	1
of	1
the	1
Germans,	1
and	1
the	1
Macrocephalus	1
of	1
the	1
Long	1
Words.	1
He	1
is,	1
without	1
doubt,	1
the	1
largest	1
inhabitant	1
of	1
the	1
globe;	1
the	1
most	1
formidable	1
of	1
all	1
whales	1
to	1
encounter;	1
the	1
most	1
majestic	1
in	1
aspect;	1
and	1
lastly,	1
by	1
far	1
the	1
most	1
valuable	1
in	1
commerce;	1
he	1
being	1
the	1
only	1
creature	1
from	1
which	1
that	1
valuable	1
substance,	1
spermaceti,	1
is	1
obtained.	1
All	1
his	1
peculiarities	1
will,	1
in	1
many	1
other	1
places,	1
be	1
enlarged	1
upon.	1
It	1
is	1
chiefly	1
with	1
his	1
name	1
that	1
I	1
now	1
have	1
to	1
do.	1
Philologically	1
considered,	1
it	1
is	1
absurd.	1
Some	1
centuries	1
ago,	1
when	1
the	1
Sperm	1
whale	1
was	1
almost	1
wholly	1
unknown	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
proper	1
individuality,	1
and	1
when	1
his	1
oil	1
was	1
only	1
accidentally	1
obtained	1
from	1
the	1
stranded	1
fish;	1
in	1
those	1
days	1
spermaceti,	1
it	1
would	1
seem,	1
was	1
popularly	1
supposed	1
to	1
be	1
derived	1
from	1
a	1
creature	1
identical	1
with	1
the	1
one	1
then	1
known	1
in	1
England	1
as	1
the	1
Greenland	1
or	1
Right	1
Whale.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
idea	1
also,	1
that	1
this	1
same	1
spermaceti	1
was	1
that	1
quickening	1
humor	1
of	1
the	1
Greenland	1
Whale	1
which	1
the	1
first	1
syllable	1
of	1
the	1
word	1
literally	1
expresses.	1
In	1
those	1
times,	1
also,	1
spermaceti	1
was	1
exceedingly	1
scarce,	1
not	1
being	1
used	1
for	1
light,	1
but	1
only	1
as	1
an	1
ointment	1
and	1
medicament.	1
It	1
was	1
only	1
to	1
be	1
had	1
from	1
the	1
druggists	1
as	1
you	1
nowadays	1
buy	1
an	1
ounce	1
of	1
rhubarb.	1
When,	1
as	1
I	1
opine,	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
time,	1
the	1
true	1
nature	1
of	1
spermaceti	1
became	1
known,	1
its	1
original	1
name	1
was	1
still	1
retained	1
by	1
the	1
dealers;	1
no	1
doubt	1
to	1
enhance	1
its	1
value	1
by	1
a	1
notion	1
so	1
strangely	1
significant	1
of	1
its	1
scarcity.	1
And	1
so	1
the	1
appellation	1
must	1
at	1
last	1
have	1
come	1
to	1
be	1
bestowed	1
upon	1
the	1
whale	1
from	1
which	1
this	1
spermaceti	1
was	1
really	1
derived.	1
BOOK	1

(FOLIO),	1
CHAPTER	1
II.	1
(RIGHT	1
WHALE).--In	1
one	1
respect	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
most	1
venerable	1
of	1
the	1
leviathans,	1
being	1
the	1
one	1
first	1
regularly	1
hunted	1
by	1
man.	1
It	1
yields	1
the	1
article	1
commonly	1
known	1
as	1
whalebone	1
or	1
baleen;	1
and	1
the	1
oil	1
specially	1
known	1
as	1
"whale	1
oil,"	1
an	1
inferior	1
article	1
in	1
commerce.	1
Among	1
the	1
fishermen,	1
he	1
is	1
indiscriminately	1
designated	1
by	1
all	1
the	1
following	1
titles:	1
The	1
Whale;	1
the	1
Greenland	1
Whale;	1
the	1
Black	1
Whale;	1
the	1
Great	1
Whale;	1
the	1
True	1
Whale;	1
the	1
Right	1
Whale.	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
deal	1
of	1
obscurity	1
concerning	1
the	1
identity	1
of	1
the	1
species	1
thus	1
multitudinously	1
baptised.	1
What	1
then	1
is	1
the	1
whale,	1
which	1
I	1
include	1
in	1
the	1
second	1
species	1
of	1
my	1
Folios?	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
Great	1
Mysticetus	1
of	1
the	1
English	1
naturalists;	1
the	1
Greenland	1
Whale	1
of	1
the	1
English	1
whalemen;	1
the	1
Baliene	1
Ordinaire	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
whalemen;	1
the	1
Growlands	1
Walfish	1
of	1
the	1
Swedes.	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
whale	1
which	1
for	1
more	1
than	1
two	1
centuries	1
past	1
has	1
been	1
hunted	1
by	1
the	1
Dutch	1
and	1
English	1
in	1
the	1
Arctic	1
seas;	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
whale	1
which	1
the	1
American	1
fishermen	1
have	1
long	1
pursued	1
in	1
the	1
Indian	1
ocean,	1
on	1
the	1
Brazil	1
Banks,	1
on	1
the	1
Nor'	1
West	1
Coast,	1
and	1
various	1
other	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
designated	1
by	1
them	1
Right	1
Whale	1
Cruising	1
Grounds.	1
Some	1
pretend	1
to	1
see	1
a	1
difference	1
between	1
the	1
Greenland	1
whale	1
of	1
the	1
English	1
and	1
the	1
right	1
whale	1
of	1
the	1
Americans.	1
But	1
they	1
precisely	1
agree	1
in	1
all	1
their	1
grand	1
features;	1
nor	1
has	1
there	1
yet	1
been	1
presented	1
a	1
single	1
determinate	1
fact	1
upon	1
which	1
to	1
ground	1
a	1
radical	1
distinction.	1
It	1
is	1
by	1
endless	1
subdivisions	1
based	1
upon	1
the	1
most	1
inconclusive	1
differences,	1
that	1
some	1
departments	1
of	1
natural	1
history	1
become	1
so	1
repellingly	1
intricate.	1
The	1
right	1
whale	1
will	1
be	1
elsewhere	1
treated	1
of	1
at	1
some	1
length,	1
with	1
reference	1
to	1
elucidating	1
the	1
sperm	1
whale.	1
BOOK	1
I.	1
(FOLIO),	1
CHAPTER	1
III.	1
(FIN-BACK).--Under	1
this	1
head	1
I	1
reckon	1
a	1
monster	1
which,	1
by	1
the	1
various	1
names	1
of	1
Fin-Back,	1
Tall-Spout,	1
and	1
Long-John,	1
has	1
been	1
seen	1
almost	1
in	1
every	1
sea	1
and	1
is	1
commonly	1
the	1
whale	1
whose	1
distant	1
jet	1
is	1
so	1
often	1
descried	1
by	1
passengers	1
crossing	1
the	1
Atlantic,	1
in	1
the	1
New	1
York	1
packet-tracks.	1
In	1
the	1
length	1
he	1
attains,	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
baleen,	1
the	1
Fin-back	1
resembles	1
the	1
right	1
whale,	1
but	1
is	1
of	1
a	1
less	1
portly	1
girth,	1
and	1
a	1
lighter	1
colour,	1
approaching	1
to	1
olive.	1
His	1
great	1
lips	1
present	1
a	1
cable-like	1
aspect,	1
formed	1
by	1
the	1
intertwisting,	1
slanting	1
folds	1
of	1
large	1
wrinkles.	1
His	1
grand	1
distinguishing	1
feature,	1
the	1
fin,	1
from	1
which	1
he	1
derives	1
his	1
name,	1
is	1
often	1
a	1
conspicuous	1
object.	1
This	1
fin	1
is	1
some	1
three	1
or	1
four	1
feet	1
long,	1
growing	1
vertically	1
from	1
the	1
hinder	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
back,	1
of	1
an	1
angular	1
shape,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
very	1
sharp	1
pointed	1
end.	1
Even	1
if	1
not	1
the	1
slightest	1
other	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
creature	1
be	1
visible,	1
this	1
isolated	1
fin	1
will,	1
at	1
times,	1
be	1
seen	1
plainly	1
projecting	1
from	1
the	1
surface.	1
When	1
the	1
sea	1
is	1
moderately	1
calm,	1
and	1
slightly	1
marked	1
with	1
spherical	1
ripples,	1
and	1
this	1
gnomon-like	1
fin	1
stands	1
up	1
and	1
casts	1
shadows	1
upon	1
the	1
wrinkled	1
surface,	1
it	1
may	1
well	1
be	1
supposed	1
that	1
the	1
watery	1
circle	1
surrounding	1
it	1
somewhat	1
resembles	1
a	1
dial,	1
with	1
its	1
style	1
and	1
wavy	1
hour-lines	1
graved	1
on	1
it.	1
On	1
that	1
Ahaz-dial	1
the	1
shadow	1
often	1
goes	1
back.	1
The	1
Fin-Back	1
is	1
not	1
gregarious.	1
He	1
seems	1
a	1
whale-hater,	1
as	1
some	1
men	1
are	1
man-haters.	1
Very	1
shy;	1
always	1
going	1
solitary;	1
unexpectedly	1
rising	1
to	1
the	1
surface	1
in	1
the	1
remotest	1
and	1
most	1
sullen	1
waters;	1
his	1
straight	1
and	1
single	1
lofty	1
jet	1
rising	1
like	1
a	1
tall	1
misanthropic	1
spear	1
upon	1
a	1
barren	1
plain;	1
gifted	1
with	1
such	1
wondrous	1
power	1
and	1
velocity	1
in	1
swimming,	1
as	1
to	1
defy	1
all	1
present	1
pursuit	1
from	1
man;	1
this	1
leviathan	1
seems	1
the	1
banished	1
and	1
unconquerable	1
Cain	1
of	1
his	1
race,	1
bearing	1
for	1
his	1
mark	1
that	1
style	1
upon	1
his	1
back.	1
From	1
having	1
the	1
baleen	1
in	1
his	1
mouth,	1
the	1
Fin-Back	1
is	1
sometimes	1
included	1
with	1
the	1
right	1
whale,	1
among	1
a	1
theoretic	1
species	1
denominated	1
WHALEBONE	1
WHALES,	1
that	1
is,	1
whales	1
with	1
baleen.	1
Of	1
these	1
so	1
called	1
Whalebone	1
whales,	1
there	1
would	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
several	1
varieties,	1
most	1
of	1
which,	1
however,	1
are	1
little	1
known.	1
Broad-nosed	1
whales	1
and	1
beaked	1
whales;	1
pike-headed	1
whales;	1
bunched	1
whales;	1
under-jawed	1
whales	1
and	1
rostrated	1
whales,	1
are	1
the	1
fishermen's	1
names	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
sorts.	1
In	1
connection	1
with	1
this	1
appellative	1
of	1
"Whalebone	1
whales,"	1
it	1
is	1
of	1
great	1
importance	1
to	1
mention,	1
that	1
however	1
such	1
a	1
nomenclature	1
may	1
be	1
convenient	1
in	1
facilitating	1
allusions	1
to	1
some	1
kind	1
of	1
whales,	1
yet	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
vain	1
to	1
attempt	1
a	1
clear	1
classification	1
of	1
the	1
Leviathan,	1
founded	1
upon	1
either	1
his	1
baleen,	1
or	1
hump,	1
or	1
fin,	1
or	1
teeth;	1
notwithstanding	1
that	1
those	1
marked	1
parts	1
or	1
features	1
very	1
obviously	1
seem	1
better	1
adapted	1
to	1
afford	1
the	1
basis	1
for	1
a	1
regular	1
system	1
of	1
Cetology	1
than	1
any	1
other	1
detached	1
bodily	1
distinctions,	1
which	1
the	1
whale,	1
in	1
his	1
kinds,	1
presents.	1
How	1
then?	1
The	1
baleen,	1
hump,	1
back-fin,	1
and	1
teeth;	1
these	1
are	1
things	1
whose	1
peculiarities	1
are	1
indiscriminately	1
dispersed	1
among	1
all	1
sorts	1
of	1
whales,	1
without	1
any	1
regard	1
to	1
what	1
may	1
be	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
their	1
structure	1
in	1
other	1
and	1
more	1
essential	1
particulars.	1
Thus,	1
the	1
sperm	1
whale	1
and	1
the	1
humpbacked	1
whale,	1
each	1
has	1
a	1
hump;	1
but	1
there	1
the	1
similitude	1
ceases.	1
Then,	1
this	1
same	1
humpbacked	1
whale	1
and	1
the	1
Greenland	1
whale,	1
each	1
of	1
these	1
has	1
baleen;	1
but	1
there	1
again	1
the	1
similitude	1
ceases.	1
And	1
it	1
is	1
just	1
the	1
same	1
with	1
the	1
other	1
parts	1
above	1
mentioned.	1
In	1
various	1
sorts	1
of	1
whales,	1
they	1
form	1
such	1
irregular	1
combinations;	1
or,	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
any	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
detached,	1
such	1
an	1
irregular	1
isolation;	1
as	1
utterly	1
to	1
defy	1
all	1
general	1
methodization	1
formed	1
upon	1
such	1
a	1
basis.	1
On	1
this	1
rock	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
whale-naturalists	1
has	1
split.	1
But	1
it	1
may	1
possibly	1
be	1
conceived	1
that,	1
in	1
the	1
internal	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
whale,	1
in	1
his	1
anatomy--there,	1
at	1
least,	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
hit	1
the	1
right	1
classification.	1
Nay;	1
what	1
thing,	1
for	1
example,	1
is	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
Greenland	1
whale's	1
anatomy	1
more	1
striking	1
than	1
his	1
baleen?	1
Yet	1
we	1
have	1
seen	1
that	1
by	1
his	1
baleen	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
correctly	1
to	1
classify	1
the	1
Greenland	1
whale.	1
And	1
if	1
you	1
descend	1
into	1
the	1
bowels	1
of	1
the	1
various	1
leviathans,	1
why	1
there	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
find	1
distinctions	1
a	1
fiftieth	1
part	1
as	1
available	1
to	1
the	1
systematizer	1
as	1
those	1
external	1
ones	1
already	1
enumerated.	1
What	1
then	1
remains?	1
nothing	1
but	1
to	1
take	1
hold	1
of	1
the	1
whales	1
bodily,	1
in	1
their	1
entire	1
liberal	1
volume,	1
and	1
boldly	1
sort	1
them	1
that	1
way.	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
Bibliographical	1
system	1
here	1
adopted;	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
only	1
one	1
that	1
can	1
possibly	1
succeed,	1
for	1
it	1
alone	1
is	1
practicable.	1

(HUMP-BACK).--This	1

on	1
the	1
northern	1
American	1
coast.	1
He	1
has	1
been	1

there,	1

towed	1
into	1
harbor.	1
He	1
has	1
a	1
great	1
pack	1
on	1
him	1
like	1
a	1
peddler;	1
or	1
you	1
might	1
call	1
him	1
the	1
Elephant	1
and	1
Castle	1
whale.	1
At	1
any	1
rate,	1
the	1
popular	1
name	1
for	1
him	1
does	1
not	1
sufficiently	1
distinguish	1
him,	1
since	1
the	1
sperm	1
whale	1
also	1
has	1
a	1
hump	1
though	1
a	1
smaller	1
one.	1
His	1
oil	1
is	1
not	1
very	1
valuable.	1
He	1
has	1
baleen.	1
He	1
is	1
the	1
most	1
gamesome	1
and	1
light-hearted	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
whales,	1
making	1
more	1
gay	1

white	1

generally	1
than	1
any	1

of	1
them.	1

never	1

him	1

*Why	1
this	1

very	1
plain.	1
Because,	1
while	1
the	1

of	1
this	1
order,	1
though	1
smaller	1
than	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
former	1
order,	1
nevertheless	1
retain	1
a	1
proportionate	1
likeness	1
to	1
them	1
in	1
figure,	1
yet	1
the	1
bookbinder's	1
Quarto	1

its	1

does	1
not	1
preserve	1
the	1

this	1
fish,	1
whose	1
loud	1
sonorous	1
breathing,	1
or	1
rather	1
blowing,	1
has	1
furnished	1
a	1
proverb	1
to	1
landsmen,	1
is	1
so	1
well	1
known	1
a	1
denizen	1
of	1
the	1
deep,	1
yet	1
is	1
he	1
not	1
popularly	1
classed	1
among	1
whales.	1
But	1
possessing	1
all	1
the	1
grand	1
distinctive	1
features	1
of	1
the	1
leviathan,	1
most	1
naturalists	1
have	1
recognised	1
him	1
for	1
one.	1
He	1
is	1
of	1
moderate	1
octavo	1
size,	1
varying	1
from	1
fifteen	1
to	1
twenty-five	1
feet	1
in	1
length,	1
and	1
of	1
corresponding	1
dimensions	1
round	1
the	1
waist.	1
He	1
swims	1
in	1
herds;	1
he	1
is	1
never	1
regularly	1
hunted,	1
though	1
his	1
oil	1
is	1
considerable	1
in	1
quantity,	1
and	1
pretty	1
good	1
for	1
light.	1
By	1
some	1
fishermen	1
his	1
approach	1
is	1
regarded	1
as	1
premonitory	1
of	1
the	1
advance	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
sperm	1
whale.	1

CHAPTER	1
II.	1
(BLACK	1
FISH).--I	1
give	1
the	1
popular	1
fishermen's	1
names	1
for	1
all	1
these	1
fish,	1
for	1
generally	1
they	1
are	1
the	1
best.	1
Where	1
any	1
name	1
happens	1
to	1
be	1
vague	1
or	1
inexpressive,	1
I	1
shall	1
say	1
so,	1
and	1
suggest	1
another.	1
I	1
do	1
so	1
now,	1
touching	1
the	1
Black	1
Fish,	1
so-called,	1
because	1
blackness	1
is	1
the	1
rule	1
among	1
almost	1
all	1
whales.	1
So,	1
call	1
him	1
the	1
Hyena	1
Whale,	1
if	1
you	1
please.	1
His	1
voracity	1
is	1
well	1
known,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
circumstance	1
that	1
the	1
inner	1
angles	1
of	1
his	1
lips	1
are	1
curved	1
upwards,	1
he	1
carries	1
an	1
everlasting	1
Mephistophelean	1
grin	1
on	1
his	1
face.	1
This	1
whale	1
averages	1
some	1
sixteen	1
or	1
eighteen	1
feet	1
in	1
length.	1
He	1
is	1
found	1
in	1
almost	1
all	1
latitudes.	1
He	1
has	1
a	1
peculiar	1
way	1
of	1
showing	1
his	1
dorsal	1
hooked	1
fin	1
in	1
swimming,	1
which	1
looks	1
something	1
like	1
a	1
Roman	1
nose.	1
When	1
not	1
more	1
profitably	1
employed,	1
the	1
sperm	1
whale	1
hunters	1
sometimes	1
capture	1
the	1
Hyena	1
whale,	1
to	1
keep	1
up	1
the	1
supply	1
of	1
cheap	1
oil	1
for	1
domestic	1
employment--as	1
some	1
frugal	1
housekeepers,	1
in	1
the	1
absence	1
of	1
company,	1
and	1
quite	1
alone	1
by	1
themselves,	1
burn	1
unsavory	1
tallow	1
instead	1
of	1
odorous	1
wax.	1
Though	1
their	1
blubber	1
is	1
very	1
thin,	1
some	1
of	1
these	1
whales	1
will	1
yield	1
you	1
upwards	1
of	1
thirty	1
gallons	1
of	1
oil.	1

(NARWHALE),	1

is,	1
NOSTRIL	1
WHALE.--Another	1
instance	1
of	1
a	1
curiously	1
named	1
whale,	1
so	1
named	1
I	1
suppose	1
from	1
his	1
peculiar	1
horn	1
being	1
originally	1
mistaken	1
for	1
a	1
peaked	1
nose.	1
The	1
creature	1
is	1
some	1
sixteen	1
feet	1
in	1
length,	1
while	1
its	1
horn	1
averages	1
five	1
feet,	1
though	1
some	1
exceed	1
ten,	1
and	1
even	1
attain	1
to	1
fifteen	1
feet.	1
Strictly	1
speaking,	1
this	1
horn	1
is	1
but	1
a	1
lengthened	1
tusk,	1
growing	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
jaw	1
in	1
a	1
line	1
a	1
little	1
depressed	1
from	1
the	1
horizontal.	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
found	1
on	1
the	1
sinister	1
side,	1
which	1
has	1
an	1
ill	1
effect,	1
giving	1
its	1
owner	1
something	1
analogous	1
to	1
the	1
aspect	1
of	1
a	1
clumsy	1
left-handed	1
man.	1
What	1
precise	1
purpose	1
this	1
ivory	1
horn	1
or	1
lance	1
answers,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
hard	1
to	1
say.	1
It	1
does	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
used	1
like	1
the	1
blade	1
of	1
the	1
sword-fish	1
and	1
bill-fish;	1
though	1
some	1
sailors	1
tell	1
me	1
that	1
the	1
Narwhale	1
employs	1
it	1
for	1
a	1
rake	1
in	1
turning	1
over	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
for	1
food.	1
Charley	1
Coffin	1
said	1
it	1
was	1
used	1
for	1
an	1
ice-piercer;	1
for	1
the	1
Narwhale,	1
rising	1
to	1
the	1
surface	1
of	1
the	1
Polar	1
Sea,	1
and	1
finding	1
it	1
sheeted	1
with	1
ice,	1
thrusts	1
his	1
horn	1
up,	1
and	1
so	1
breaks	1
through.	1
But	1
you	1
cannot	1
prove	1
either	1
of	1
these	1
surmises	1
to	1
be	1
correct.	1
My	1
own	1
opinion	1
is,	1
that	1
however	1
this	1
one-sided	1
horn	1
may	1
really	1
be	1
used	1
by	1
the	1
Narwhale--however	1
that	1
may	1
be--it	1
would	1
certainly	1
be	1
very	1
convenient	1
to	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
folder	1
in	1
reading	1
pamphlets.	1
The	1
Narwhale	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
called	1
the	1
Tusked	1
whale,	1
the	1
Horned	1
whale,	1
and	1
the	1
Unicorn	1
whale.	1
He	1
is	1
certainly	1
a	1
curious	1
example	1
of	1
the	1
Unicornism	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
almost	1
every	1
kingdom	1
of	1
animated	1
nature.	1
From	1
certain	1
cloistered	1
old	1
authors	1
I	1
have	1
gathered	1
that	1
this	1
same	1
sea-unicorn's	1
horn	1
was	1
in	1
ancient	1
days	1
regarded	1
as	1
the	1
great	1
antidote	1
against	1
poison,	1
and	1
as	1
such,	1
preparations	1
of	1
it	1
brought	1
immense	1
prices.	1
It	1
was	1
also	1
distilled	1
to	1
a	1
volatile	1
salts	1
for	1
fainting	1
ladies,	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
that	1
the	1
horns	1
of	1
the	1
male	1
deer	1
are	1
manufactured	1
into	1
hartshorn.	1
Originally	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
itself	1
accounted	1
an	1
object	1
of	1
great	1
curiosity.	1
Black	1
Letter	1
tells	1
me	1
that	1
Sir	1
Martin	1
Frobisher	1
on	1
his	1
return	1
from	1
that	1
voyage,	1
when	1
Queen	1
Bess	1
did	1
gallantly	1
wave	1
her	1
jewelled	1
hand	1
to	1
him	1
from	1
a	1
window	1
of	1
Greenwich	1
Palace,	1
as	1
his	1
bold	1
ship	1
sailed	1
down	1
the	1
Thames;	1
"when	1
Sir	1
Martin	1
returned	1
from	1
that	1
voyage,"	1
saith	1
Black	1
Letter,	1
"on	1
bended	1
knees	1
he	1
presented	1
to	1
her	1
highness	1
a	1
prodigious	1
long	1
horn	1
of	1
the	1
Narwhale,	1
which	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
period	1
after	1
hung	1
in	1
the	1
castle	1
at	1
Windsor."	1
An	1
Irish	1
author	1
avers	1
that	1
the	1
Earl	1
of	1
Leicester,	1
on	1
bended	1
knees,	1
did	1
likewise	1
present	1
to	1
her	1
highness	1
another	1
horn,	1
pertaining	1
to	1
a	1
land	1
beast	1
of	1
the	1
unicorn	1
nature.	1
The	1
Narwhale	1
has	1
a	1
very	1
picturesque,	1
leopard-like	1
look,	1
being	1
of	1
a	1
milk-white	1
ground	1
colour,	1
dotted	1
with	1
round	1
and	1
oblong	1
spots	1
of	1
black.	1
His	1
oil	1
is	1
very	1
superior,	1
clear	1
and	1
fine;	1
but	1
there	1
is	1
little	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
seldom	1
hunted.	1
He	1
is	1
mostly	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
circumpolar	1

and	1
nothing	1
at	1
all	1
to	1
the	1
professed	1
naturalist.	1
From	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
of	1
him	1
at	1
a	1
distance,	1
I	1
should	1
say	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
about	1
the	1
bigness	1
of	1
a	1
grampus.	1
He	1
is	1
very	1
savage--a	1
sort	1
of	1
Feegee	1
fish.	1
He	1
sometimes	1
takes	1
the	1
great	1
Folio	1
whales	1
by	1
the	1
lip,	1
and	1
hangs	1
there	1
like	1
a	1
leech,	1
till	1
the	1
mighty	1
brute	1
is	1
worried	1
to	1
death.	1
The	1
Killer	1
is	1
never	1
hunted.	1
I	1
never	1
heard	1
what	1
sort	1
of	1
oil	1
he	1
has.	1
Exception	1
might	1
be	1
taken	1
to	1
the	1
name	1
bestowed	1
upon	1
this	1
whale,	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
of	1
its	1
indistinctness.	1
For	1
we	1
are	1
all	1
killers,	1
on	1
land	1
and	1
on	1
sea;	1
Bonapartes	1
and	1
Sharks	1
included.	1

V.	1
(THRASHER).--This	1

famous	1
for	1
his	1
tail,	1
which	1
he	1
uses	1
for	1
a	1
ferule	1
in	1
thrashing	1
his	1
foes.	1
He	1
mounts	1
the	1
Folio	1
whale's	1
back,	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
swims,	1
he	1
works	1
his	1
passage	1
by	1
flogging	1
him;	1
as	1
some	1
schoolmasters	1
get	1
along	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
by	1
a	1
similar	1
process.	1
Still	1
less	1
is	1
known	1
of	1
the	1
Thrasher	1
than	1
of	1
the	1

Both	1
are	1
outlaws,	1
even	1
in	1

lawless	1

to	1
study	1
the	1

it	1
may	1
possibly	1
seem	1
strange,	1
that	1
fishes	1
not	1
commonly	1
exceeding	1
four	1
or	1

feet	1
should	1
be	1
marshalled	1

WHALES--a	1
word,	1
which,	1
in	1
the	1
popular	1
sense,	1
always	1
conveys	1
an	1
idea	1
of	1
hugeness.	1
But	1
the	1
creatures	1

Duodecimoes	1

infallibly	1
whales,	1
by	1
the	1
terms	1
of	1
my	1
definition	1
of	1
what	1
a	1
whale	1
is--i.e.	1
a	1
spouting	1
fish,	1
with	1
a	1
horizontal	1
tail.	1

CHAPTER	1
1.	1
(HUZZA	1
PORPOISE).--This	1
is	1
the	1
common	1
porpoise	1
found	1
almost	1
all	1
over	1
the	1
globe.	1
The	1
name	1
is	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
bestowal;	1
for	1
there	1
are	1
more	1
than	1
one	1
sort	1
of	1
porpoises,	1
and	1
something	1
must	1
be	1
done	1
to	1
distinguish	1
them.	1
I	1
call	1
him	1
thus,	1
because	1
he	1
always	1
swims	1
in	1
hilarious	1
shoals,	1
which	1
upon	1
the	1
broad	1
sea	1
keep	1
tossing	1
themselves	1
to	1
heaven	1
like	1
caps	1
in	1
a	1
Fourth-of-July	1
crowd.	1
Their	1
appearance	1
is	1
generally	1
hailed	1
with	1
delight	1
by	1
the	1
mariner.	1
Full	1
of	1
fine	1
spirits,	1
they	1
invariably	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
breezy	1
billows	1
to	1
windward.	1
They	1
are	1
the	1
lads	1
that	1
always	1
live	1
before	1
the	1
wind.	1
They	1
are	1
accounted	1
a	1
lucky	1
omen.	1
If	1
you	1
yourself	1
can	1
withstand	1
three	1
cheers	1
at	1
beholding	1
these	1
vivacious	1
fish,	1
then	1
heaven	1
help	1
ye;	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
godly	1
gamesomeness	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
ye.	1
A	1
well-fed,	1
plump	1
Huzza	1
Porpoise	1
will	1
yield	1
you	1
one	1
good	1
gallon	1
of	1
good	1
oil.	1
But	1
the	1
fine	1
and	1
delicate	1
fluid	1
extracted	1
from	1
his	1
jaws	1
is	1
exceedingly	1
valuable.	1
It	1
is	1
in	1
request	1
among	1
jewellers	1
and	1
watchmakers.	1
Sailors	1
put	1
it	1
on	1
their	1
hones.	1
Porpoise	1
meat	1
is	1
good	1
eating,	1
you	1
know.	1
It	1
may	1
never	1
have	1
occurred	1
to	1
you	1
that	1
a	1
porpoise	1
spouts.	1
Indeed,	1
his	1
spout	1
is	1
so	1
small	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
very	1
readily	1
discernible.	1
But	1
the	1
next	1
time	1
you	1
have	1
a	1
chance,	1
watch	1
him;	1
and	1
you	1
will	1
then	1
see	1
the	1
great	1
Sperm	1
whale	1
himself	1
in	1
miniature.	1

Very	1

He	1
is	1
only	1
found,	1
I	1
think,	1
in	1
the	1

He	1
is	1
somewhat	1

but	1
much	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
general	1
make.	1
Provoke	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
buckle	1
to	1
a	1
shark.	1
I	1
have	1
lowered	1
for	1
him	1
many	1
times,	1
but	1
never	1
yet	1
saw	1
him	1
captured.	1

CHAPTER	1
III.	1
(MEALY-MOUTHED	1
PORPOISE).--The	1
largest	1
kind	1
of	1
Porpoise;	1
and	1
only	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
Pacific,	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
known.	1
The	1
only	1
English	1
name,	1
by	1
which	1
he	1
has	1
hitherto	1
been	1
designated,	1
is	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
fishers--Right-Whale	1
Porpoise,	1
from	1
the	1
circumstance	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
chiefly	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
vicinity	1
of	1
that	1
Folio.	1
In	1
shape,	1
he	1
differs	1
in	1
some	1
degree	1
from	1
the	1
Huzza	1
Porpoise,	1
being	1
of	1
a	1
less	1
rotund	1
and	1
jolly	1
girth;	1
indeed,	1
he	1
is	1
of	1
quite	1
a	1
neat	1
and	1
gentleman-like	1
figure.	1
He	1
has	1
no	1
fins	1
on	1
his	1
back	1
(most	1
other	1
porpoises	1
have),	1
he	1
has	1
a	1
lovely	1
tail,	1
and	1
sentimental	1
Indian	1
eyes	1
of	1
a	1
hazel	1
hue.	1
But	1
his	1
mealy-mouth	1
spoils	1
all.	1
Though	1
his	1
entire	1
back	1
down	1
to	1
his	1
side	1
fins	1
is	1
of	1
a	1
deep	1
sable,	1
yet	1
a	1
boundary	1
line,	1
distinct	1
as	1
the	1
mark	1
in	1
a	1
ship's	1
hull,	1
called	1
the	1
"bright	1
waist,"	1
that	1
line	1
streaks	1
him	1
from	1
stem	1
to	1
stern,	1
with	1
two	1
separate	1
colours,	1
black	1
above	1
and	1
white	1
below.	1
The	1
white	1
comprises	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
his	1
mouth,	1
which	1
makes	1
him	1
look	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
just	1
escaped	1
from	1
a	1
felonious	1
visit	1
to	1
a	1
meal-bag.	1
A	1
most	1
mean	1
and	1
mealy	1
aspect!	1
His	1
oil	1
is	1
much	1
like	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
common	1
porpoise.	1
Beyond	1
the	1
DUODECIMO,	1
this	1
system	1
does	1
not	1
proceed,	1
inasmuch	1
as	1
the	1
Porpoise	1
is	1
the	1
smallest	1
of	1
the	1
whales.	1
Above,	1
you	1
have	1
all	1
the	1
Leviathans	1
of	1
note.	1
But	1
there	1
are	1
a	1
rabble	1
of	1
uncertain,	1
fugitive,	1
half-fabulous	1
whales,	1
which,	1
as	1
an	1
American	1
whaleman,	1
I	1
know	1
by	1
reputation,	1
but	1
not	1
personally.	1
I	1
shall	1
enumerate	1
them	1
by	1
their	1
fore-castle	1
appellations;	1
for	1
possibly	1
such	1
a	1
list	1
may	1
be	1
valuable	1
to	1
future	1
investigators,	1
who	1
may	1
complete	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
here	1
but	1
begun.	1
If	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
following	1
whales,	1
shall	1
hereafter	1
be	1
caught	1
and	1
marked,	1
then	1
he	1
can	1
readily	1
be	1
incorporated	1
into	1
this	1
System,	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
Folio,	1
Octavo,	1
or	1
Duodecimo	1
magnitude:--The	1
Bottle-Nose	1
Whale;	1
the	1
Junk	1
Whale;	1
the	1
Pudding-Headed	1
Whale;	1
the	1
Cape	1
Whale;	1
the	1
Leading	1
Whale;	1
the	1
Cannon	1
Whale;	1
the	1
Scragg	1
Whale;	1
the	1
Coppered	1
Whale;	1
the	1
Elephant	1
Whale;	1
the	1
Iceberg	1
Whale;	1
the	1
Quog	1
Whale;	1
the	1
Blue	1
Whale;	1
etc.	1
From	1
Icelandic,	1
Dutch,	1
and	1
old	1
English	1
authorities,	1
there	1
might	1
be	1
quoted	1
other	1
lists	1
of	1
uncertain	1
whales,	1
blessed	1
with	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
uncouth	1
names.	1
But	1
I	1
omit	1
them	1
as	1
altogether	1
obsolete;	1
and	1
can	1
hardly	1
help	1
suspecting	1
them	1
for	1
mere	1
sounds,	1
full	1
of	1
Leviathanism,	1
but	1
signifying	1
nothing.	1
Finally:	1
It	1
was	1
stated	1
at	1
the	1
outset,	1
that	1
this	1
system	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
here,	1
and	1
at	1
once,	1
perfected.	1
You	1
cannot	1
but	1
plainly	1
see	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
kept	1
my	1
word.	1
But	1
I	1
now	1
leave	1
my	1
cetological	1
System	1
standing	1
thus	1
unfinished,	1
even	1
as	1
the	1
great	1
Cathedral	1
of	1
Cologne	1
was	1
left,	1
with	1
the	1
crane	1
still	1
standing	1
upon	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
uncompleted	1
tower.	1
For	1
small	1
erections	1
may	1
be	1
finished	1
by	1
their	1
first	1
architects;	1
grand	1
ones,	1
true	1
ones,	1
ever	1
leave	1
the	1
copestone	1
to	1
posterity.	1
God	1
keep	1
me	1
from	1
ever	1
completing	1
anything.	1
This	1
whole	1
book	1
is	1
but	1
a	1
draught--nay,	1
but	1
the	1
draught	1
of	1
a	1
draught.	1
Oh,	1
Time,	1
Strength,	1
Cash,	1
and	1
Patience!	1
CHAPTER	1
33	1
The	1
Specksynder.	1
Concerning	1
the	1
officers	1
of	1
the	1
whale-craft,	1
this	1
seems	1
as	1
good	1
a	1
place	1
as	1
any	1
to	1
set	1
down	1
a	1
little	1
domestic	1
peculiarity	1
on	1
ship-board,	1
arising	1
from	1
the	1
existence	1
of	1
the	1
harpooneer	1
class	1
of	1
officers,	1
a	1
class	1
unknown	1
of	1
course	1
in	1
any	1
other	1
marine	1
than	1
the	1
whale-fleet.	1
The	1
large	1
importance	1
attached	1
to	1
the	1
harpooneer's	1
vocation	1
is	1
evinced	1
by	1
the	1
fact,	1
that	1
originally	1
in	1
the	1
old	1
Dutch	1
Fishery,	1
two	1
centuries	1
and	1
more	1
ago,	1
the	1
command	1
of	1
a	1
whale	1
ship	1
was	1
not	1
wholly	1
lodged	1
in	1
the	1
person	1
now	1
called	1
the	1
captain,	1
but	1
was	1
divided	1
between	1
him	1
and	1
an	1
officer	1
called	1
the	1
Specksynder.	1
Literally	1
this	1
word	1
means	1
Fat-Cutter;	1
usage,	1
however,	1
in	1
time	1
made	1
it	1
equivalent	1
to	1
Chief	1
Harpooneer.	1
In	1
those	1
days,	1
the	1
captain's	1
authority	1
was	1
restricted	1
to	1
the	1
navigation	1
and	1
general	1
management	1
of	1
the	1
vessel;	1
while	1
over	1
the	1
whale-hunting	1
department	1
and	1
all	1
its	1
concerns,	1
the	1
Specksynder	1
or	1
Chief	1
Harpooneer	1
reigned	1
supreme.	1
In	1
the	1
British	1
Greenland	1
Fishery,	1
under	1
the	1
corrupted	1
title	1
of	1
Specksioneer,	1
this	1
old	1
Dutch	1
official	1
is	1
still	1
retained,	1
but	1
his	1
former	1
dignity	1
is	1
sadly	1
abridged.	1
At	1
present	1
he	1
ranks	1
simply	1
as	1
senior	1
Harpooneer;	1
and	1
as	1
such,	1
is	1
but	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
captain's	1
more	1
inferior	1
subalterns.	1
Nevertheless,	1
as	1
upon	1
the	1
good	1
conduct	1
of	1
the	1
harpooneers	1
the	1
success	1
of	1
a	1
whaling	1
voyage	1
largely	1
depends,	1
and	1
since	1
in	1
the	1
American	1
Fishery	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
only	1
an	1
important	1
officer	1
in	1
the	1
boat,	1
but	1
under	1
certain	1
circumstances	1
(night	1
watches	1
on	1
a	1
whaling	1
ground)	1
the	1
command	1
of	1
the	1
ship's	1
deck	1
is	1
also	1
his;	1
therefore	1
the	1
grand	1
political	1
maxim	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
demands,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
nominally	1
live	1
apart	1
from	1
the	1
men	1
before	1
the	1
mast,	1
and	1
be	1
in	1
some	1
way	1
distinguished	1
as	1
their	1
professional	1
superior;	1
though	1
always,	1
by	1
them,	1
familiarly	1
regarded	1
as	1
their	1
social	1
equal.	1
Now,	1
the	1
grand	1
distinction	1
drawn	1
between	1
officer	1
and	1
man	1
at	1
sea,	1
is	1
this--the	1
first	1
lives	1
aft,	1
the	1
last	1
forward.	1
Hence,	1
in	1
whale-ships	1
and	1
merchantmen	1
alike,	1
the	1
mates	1
have	1
their	1
quarters	1
with	1
the	1
captain;	1
and	1
so,	1
too,	1
in	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
American	1
whalers	1
the	1
harpooneers	1
are	1
lodged	1
in	1
the	1
after	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
ship.	1
That	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
they	1
take	1
their	1
meals	1
in	1
the	1
captain's	1
cabin,	1
and	1
sleep	1
in	1
a	1
place	1
indirectly	1
communicating	1
with	1
it.	1
Though	1
the	1
long	1
period	1
of	1
a	1
Southern	1
whaling	1
voyage	1
(by	1
far	1
the	1
longest	1
of	1
all	1
voyages	1
now	1
or	1
ever	1
made	1
by	1
man),	1
the	1
peculiar	1
perils	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
the	1
community	1
of	1
interest	1
prevailing	1
among	1
a	1
company,	1
all	1
of	1
whom,	1
high	1
or	1
low,	1
depend	1
for	1
their	1
profits,	1
not	1
upon	1
fixed	1
wages,	1
but	1
upon	1
their	1
common	1
luck,	1
together	1
with	1
their	1
common	1
vigilance,	1
intrepidity,	1
and	1
hard	1
work;	1
though	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
do	1
in	1
some	1
cases	1
tend	1
to	1
beget	1
a	1
less	1
rigorous	1
discipline	1
than	1
in	1
merchantmen	1
generally;	1
yet,	1
never	1
mind	1
how	1
much	1
like	1
an	1
old	1
Mesopotamian	1
family	1
these	1
whalemen	1
may,	1
in	1
some	1
primitive	1
instances,	1
live	1
together;	1
for	1
all	1
that,	1
the	1
punctilious	1
externals,	1
at	1
least,	1
of	1
the	1
quarter-deck	1
are	1
seldom	1
materially	1
relaxed,	1
and	1
in	1
no	1
instance	1
done	1
away.	1
Indeed,	1
many	1
are	1
the	1
Nantucket	1
ships	1
in	1
which	1
you	1
will	1
see	1
the	1
skipper	1
parading	1
his	1
quarter-deck	1
with	1
an	1
elated	1
grandeur	1
not	1
surpassed	1
in	1
any	1
military	1
navy;	1
nay,	1
extorting	1
almost	1
as	1
much	1
outward	1
homage	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
wore	1
the	1
imperial	1
purple,	1
and	1
not	1
the	1
shabbiest	1
of	1
pilot-cloth.	1
And	1
though	1
of	1
all	1
men	1
the	1
moody	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
Pequod	1
was	1
the	1
least	1
given	1
to	1
that	1
sort	1
of	1
shallowest	1
assumption;	1
and	1
though	1
the	1
only	1
homage	1
he	1
ever	1
exacted,	1
was	1
implicit,	1
instantaneous	1
obedience;	1
though	1
he	1
required	1
no	1
man	1
to	1
remove	1
the	1
shoes	1
from	1
his	1
feet	1
ere	1
stepping	1
upon	1
the	1
quarter-deck;	1
and	1
though	1
there	1
were	1
times	1
when,	1
owing	1
to	1
peculiar	1
circumstances	1
connected	1
with	1
events	1
hereafter	1
to	1
be	1
detailed,	1
he	1
addressed	1
them	1
in	1
unusual	1
terms,	1
whether	1
of	1
condescension	1
or	1
IN	1
TERROREM,	1
or	1
otherwise;	1
yet	1
even	1
Captain	1
Ahab	1
was	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
unobservant	1
of	1
the	1
paramount	1
forms	1
and	1
usages	1
of	1
the	1
sea.	1
Nor,	1
perhaps,	1
will	1
it	1
fail	1
to	1
be	1
eventually	1
perceived,	1
that	1
behind	1
those	1
forms	1
and	1
usages,	1
as	1
it	1
were,	1
he	1
sometimes	1
masked	1
himself;	1
incidentally	1
making	1
use	1
of	1
them	1
for	1
other	1
and	1
more	1
private	1
ends	1
than	1
they	1
were	1
legitimately	1
intended	1
to	1
subserve.	1
That	1
certain	1
sultanism	1
of	1
his	1
brain,	1
which	1
had	1
otherwise	1
in	1
a	1
good	1
degree	1
remained	1
unmanifested;	1
through	1
those	1
forms	1
that	1
same	1
sultanism	1
became	1
incarnate	1
in	1
an	1
irresistible	1
dictatorship.	1
For	1
be	1
a	1
man's	1
intellectual	1
superiority	1
what	1
it	1
will,	1
it	1
can	1
never	1
assume	1
the	1
practical,	1
available	1
supremacy	1
over	1
other	1
men,	1
without	1
the	1
aid	1
of	1
some	1
sort	1
of	1
external	1
arts	1
and	1
entrenchments,	1
always,	1
in	1
themselves,	1
more	1
or	1
less	1
paltry	1
and	1
base.	1
This	1
it	1
is,	1
that	1
for	1
ever	1
keeps	1
God's	1
true	1
princes	1
of	1
the	1
Empire	1
from	1
the	1
world's	1
hustings;	1
and	1
leaves	1
the	1
highest	1
honours	1
that	1
this	1
air	1
can	1
give,	1
to	1
those	1
men	1
who	1
become	1
famous	1
more	1
through	1
their	1
infinite	1
inferiority	1
to	1
the	1
choice	1
hidden	1
handful	1
of	1
the	1
Divine	1
Inert,	1
than	1
through	1
their	1
undoubted	1
superiority	1
over	1
the	1
dead	1
level	1
of	1
the	1
mass.	1
Such	1
large	1
virtue	1
lurks	1
in	1
these	1
small	1
things	1
when	1
extreme	1
political	1
superstitions	1
invest	1
them,	1
that	1
in	1
some	1
royal	1
instances	1
even	1
to	1
idiot	1
imbecility	1
they	1
have	1
imparted	1
potency.	1
But	1
when,	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
Nicholas	1
the	1
Czar,	1
the	1
ringed	1
crown	1
of	1
geographical	1
empire	1
encircles	1
an	1
imperial	1
brain;	1
then,	1
the	1
plebeian	1
herds	1
crouch	1
abased	1
before	1
the	1
tremendous	1
centralization.	1
Nor,	1
will	1
the	1
tragic	1
dramatist	1
who	1
would	1
depict	1
mortal	1
indomitableness	1
in	1
its	1
fullest	1
sweep	1
and	1
direct	1
swing,	1
ever	1
forget	1
a	1
hint,	1
incidentally	1
so	1
important	1
in	1
his	1
art,	1
as	1
the	1
one	1
now	1
alluded	1
to.	1
But	1
Ahab,	1
my	1
Captain,	1
still	1
moves	1
before	1
me	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
Nantucket	1
grimness	1
and	1
shagginess;	1
and	1
in	1
this	1
episode	1
touching	1
Emperors	1
and	1
Kings,	1
I	1
must	1
not	1
conceal	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
only	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
a	1
poor	1
old	1
whale-hunter	1
like	1
him;	1
and,	1
therefore,	1
all	1
outward	1
majestical	1
trappings	1
and	1
housings	1
are	1
denied	1
me.	1
Oh,	1
Ahab!	1
what	1
shall	1
be	1
grand	1
in	1
thee,	1
it	1
must	1
needs	1
be	1
plucked	1
at	1
from	1
the	1
skies,	1
and	1
dived	1
for	1
in	1
the	1
deep,	1
and	1
featured	1
in	1
the	1
unbodied	1
air!	1
CHAPTER	1
34	1
The	1
Cabin-Table.	1
It	1
is	1
noon;	1
and	1
Dough-Boy,	1
the	1
steward,	1
thrusting	1
his	1
pale	1
loaf-of-bread	1
face	1
from	1
the	1
cabin-scuttle,	1
announces	1
dinner	1
to	1
his	1
lord	1
and	1
master;	1
who,	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
lee	1
quarter-boat,	1
has	1
just	1
been	1
taking	1
an	1
observation	1
of	1
the	1
sun;	1
and	1
is	1
now	1
mutely	1
reckoning	1
the	1
latitude	1
on	1
the	1
smooth,	1
medallion-shaped	1
tablet,	1
reserved	1
for	1
that	1
daily	1
purpose	1
on	1
the	1
upper	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
ivory	1
leg.	1
From	1
his	1
complete	1
inattention	1
to	1
the	1
tidings,	1
you	1
would	1
think	1
that	1
moody	1
Ahab	1
had	1
not	1
heard	1
his	1
menial.	1
But	1
presently,	1
catching	1
hold	1
of	1
the	1
mizen	1
shrouds,	1
he	1
swings	1
himself	1
to	1
the	1
deck,	1
and	1
in	1
an	1
even,	1
unexhilarated	1
voice,	1
saying,	1
"Dinner,	1
Mr.	1
Starbuck,"	1
disappears	1
into	1
the	1
cabin.	1
When	1
the	1
last	1
echo	1
of	1
his	1
sultan's	1
step	1
has	1
died	1
away,	1
and	1
Starbuck,	1
the	1
first	1
Emir,	1
has	1
every	1
reason	1
to	1
suppose	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
seated,	1
then	1
Starbuck	1
rouses	1
from	1
his	1
quietude,	1
takes	1
a	1
few	1
turns	1
along	1
the	1
planks,	1
and,	1
after	1
a	1
grave	1
peep	1
into	1
the	1
binnacle,	1
says,	1
with	1
some	1
touch	1
of	1
pleasantness,	1
"Dinner,	1
Mr.	1
Stubb,"	1
and	1
descends	1
the	1
scuttle.	1
The	1
second	1
Emir	1
lounges	1
about	1
the	1
rigging	1
awhile,	1
and	1
then	1
slightly	1
shaking	1
the	1
main	1
brace,	1
to	1
see	1
whether	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
all	1
right	1
with	1
that	1
important	1
rope,	1
he	1
likewise	1
takes	1
up	1
the	1
old	1
burden,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
rapid	1
"Dinner,	1
Mr.	1
Flask,"	1
follows	1
after	1
his	1
predecessors.	1
But	1
the	1
third	1
Emir,	1
now	1
seeing	1
himself	1
all	1
alone	1
on	1
the	1
quarter-deck,	1
seems	1
to	1
feel	1
relieved	1
from	1
some	1
curious	1
restraint;	1
for,	1
tipping	1
all	1
sorts	1
of	1
knowing	1
winks	1
in	1
all	1
sorts	1
of	1
directions,	1
and	1
kicking	1
off	1
his	1
shoes,	1
he	1
strikes	1
into	1
a	1
sharp	1
but	1
noiseless	1
squall	1
of	1
a	1
hornpipe	1
right	1
over	1
the	1
Grand	1
Turk's	1
head;	1
and	1
then,	1
by	1
a	1
dexterous	1
sleight,	1
pitching	1
his	1
cap	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
mizentop	1
for	1
a	1
shelf,	1
he	1
goes	1
down	1
rollicking	1
so	1
far	1
at	1
least	1
as	1
he	1
remains	1
visible	1
from	1
the	1
deck,	1
reversing	1
all	1
other	1
processions,	1
by	1
bringing	1
up	1
the	1
rear	1
with	1
music.	1
But	1
ere	1
stepping	1
into	1
the	1
cabin	1
doorway	1
below,	1
he	1
pauses,	1
ships	1
a	1
new	1
face	1
altogether,	1
and,	1
then,	1
independent,	1
hilarious	1
little	1
Flask	1
enters	1
King	1
Ahab's	1
presence,	1
in	1
the	1
character	1
of	1
Abjectus,	1
or	1
the	1
Slave.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
least	1
among	1
the	1
strange	1
things	1
bred	1
by	1
the	1
intense	1
artificialness	1
of	1
sea-usages,	1
that	1
while	1
in	1
the	1
open	1
air	1
of	1
the	1
deck	1
some	1
officers	1
will,	1
upon	1
provocation,	1
bear	1
themselves	1
boldly	1
and	1
defyingly	1
enough	1
towards	1
their	1
commander;	1
yet,	1
ten	1
to	1
one,	1
let	1
those	1
very	1
officers	1
the	1
next	1
moment	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
their	1
customary	1
dinner	1
in	1
that	1
same	1
commander's	1
cabin,	1
and	1
straightway	1
their	1
inoffensive,	1
not	1
to	1
say	1
deprecatory	1
and	1
humble	1
air	1
towards	1
him,	1
as	1
he	1
sits	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
table;	1
this	1
is	1
marvellous,	1
sometimes	1
most	1
comical.	1
Wherefore	1
this	1
difference?	1
A	1
problem?	1
Perhaps	1
not.	1
To	1
have	1
been	1
Belshazzar,	1
King	1
of	1
Babylon;	1
and	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
Belshazzar,	1
not	1
haughtily	1
but	1
courteously,	1
therein	1
certainly	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
some	1
touch	1
of	1
mundane	1
grandeur.	1
But	1
he	1
who	1
in	1
the	1
rightly	1
regal	1
and	1
intelligent	1
spirit	1
presides	1
over	1
his	1
own	1
private	1
dinner-table	1
of	1
invited	1
guests,	1
that	1
man's	1
unchallenged	1
power	1
and	1
dominion	1
of	1
individual	1
influence	1
for	1
the	1
time;	1
that	1
man's	1
royalty	1
of	1
state	1
transcends	1
Belshazzar's,	1
for	1
Belshazzar	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
greatest.	1
Who	1
has	1
but	1
once	1
dined	1
his	1
friends,	1
has	1
tasted	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
Caesar.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
witchery	1
of	1
social	1
czarship	1
which	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
withstanding.	1
Now,	1
if	1
to	1
this	1
consideration	1
you	1
superadd	1
the	1
official	1
supremacy	1
of	1
a	1
ship-master,	1
then,	1
by	1
inference,	1
you	1
will	1
derive	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
that	1
peculiarity	1
of	1
sea-life	1
just	1
mentioned.	1
Over	1
his	1
ivory-inlaid	1
table,	1
Ahab	1
presided	1
like	1
a	1
mute,	1
maned	1
sea-lion	1
on	1
the	1
white	1
coral	1
beach,	1
surrounded	1
by	1
his	1
warlike	1
but	1
still	1
deferential	1
cubs.	1
In	1
his	1
own	1
proper	1
turn,	1
each	1
officer	1
waited	1
to	1
be	1
served.	1
They	1
were	1
as	1
little	1
children	1
before	1
Ahab;	1
and	1
yet,	1
in	1
Ahab,	1
there	1
seemed	1
not	1
to	1
lurk	1
the	1
smallest	1
social	1
arrogance.	1
With	1
one	1
mind,	1
their	1
intent	1
eyes	1
all	1
fastened	1
upon	1
the	1
old	1
man's	1
knife,	1
as	1
he	1
carved	1
the	1
chief	1
dish	1
before	1
him.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
suppose	1
that	1
for	1
the	1
world	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
profaned	1
that	1
moment	1
with	1
the	1
slightest	1
observation,	1
even	1
upon	1
so	1
neutral	1
a	1
topic	1
as	1
the	1
weather.	1
No!	1
And	1
when	1
reaching	1
out	1
his	1
knife	1
and	1
fork,	1
between	1
which	1
the	1
slice	1
of	1
beef	1
was	1
locked,	1
Ahab	1
thereby	1
motioned	1
Starbuck's	1
plate	1
towards	1
him,	1
the	1
mate	1
received	1
his	1
meat	1
as	1
though	1
receiving	1
alms;	1
and	1
cut	1
it	1
tenderly;	1
and	1
a	1
little	1
started	1
if,	1
perchance,	1
the	1
knife	1
grazed	1
against	1
the	1
plate;	1
and	1
chewed	1
it	1
noiselessly;	1
and	1
swallowed	1
it,	1
not	1
without	1
circumspection.	1
For,	1
like	1
the	1
Coronation	1
banquet	1
at	1
Frankfort,	1
where	1
the	1
German	1
Emperor	1
profoundly	1
dines	1
with	1
the	1
seven	1
Imperial	1
Electors,	1
so	1
these	1
cabin	1
meals	1
were	1
somehow	1
solemn	1
meals,	1
eaten	1
in	1
awful	1
silence;	1
and	1
yet	1
at	1
table	1
old	1
Ahab	1
forbade	1
not	1
conversation;	1
only	1
he	1
himself	1
was	1
dumb.	1
What	1
a	1
relief	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
choking	1
Stubb,	1
when	1
a	1
rat	1
made	1
a	1
sudden	1
racket	1
in	1
the	1
hold	1
below.	1
And	1
poor	1
little	1
Flask,	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
youngest	1
son,	1
and	1
little	1
boy	1
of	1
this	1
weary	1
family	1
party.	1
His	1
were	1
the	1
shinbones	1
of	1
the	1
saline	1
beef;	1
his	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
drumsticks.	1
For	1
Flask	1
to	1
have	1
presumed	1
to	1
help	1
himself,	1
this	1
must	1
have	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
tantamount	1
to	1
larceny	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
degree.	1
Had	1
he	1
helped	1
himself	1
at	1
that	1
table,	1
doubtless,	1
never	1
more	1
would	1
he	1
have	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
hold	1
his	1
head	1
up	1
in	1
this	1
honest	1
world;	1
nevertheless,	1
strange	1
to	1
say,	1
Ahab	1
never	1
forbade	1
him.	1
And	1
had	1
Flask	1
helped	1
himself,	1
the	1
chances	1
were	1
Ahab	1
had	1
never	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
noticed	1
it.	1
Least	1
of	1
all,	1
did	1
Flask	1
presume	1
to	1
help	1
himself	1
to	1
butter.	1
Whether	1
he	1
thought	1
the	1
owners	1
of	1
the	1
ship	1
denied	1
it	1
to	1
him,	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
its	1
clotting	1
his	1
clear,	1
sunny	1
complexion;	1
or	1
whether	1
he	1
deemed	1
that,	1
on	1
so	1
long	1
a	1
voyage	1
in	1
such	1
marketless	1
waters,	1
butter	1
was	1
at	1
a	1
premium,	1
and	1
therefore	1
was	1
not	1
for	1
him,	1
a	1
subaltern;	1
however	1
it	1
was,	1
Flask,	1
alas!	1
was	1
a	1
butterless	1
man!	1
Another	1
thing.	1
Flask	1
was	1
the	1
last	1
person	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
dinner,	1
and	1
Flask	1
is	1
the	1
first	1
man	1
up.	1
Consider!	1
For	1
hereby	1
Flask's	1
dinner	1
was	1
badly	1
jammed	1
in	1
point	1
of	1
time.	1
Starbuck	1
and	1
Stubb	1
both	1
had	1
the	1
start	1
of	1
him;	1
and	1
yet	1
they	1
also	1
have	1
the	1
privilege	1
of	1
lounging	1
in	1
the	1
rear.	1
If	1
Stubb	1
even,	1
who	1
is	1
but	1
a	1
peg	1
higher	1
than	1
Flask,	1
happens	1
to	1
have	1
but	1
a	1
small	1
appetite,	1
and	1
soon	1
shows	1
symptoms	1
of	1
concluding	1
his	1
repast,	1
then	1
Flask	1
must	1
bestir	1
himself,	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
get	1
more	1
than	1
three	1
mouthfuls	1
that	1
day;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
against	1
holy	1
usage	1
for	1
Stubb	1
to	1
precede	1
Flask	1
to	1
the	1
deck.	1
Therefore	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
Flask	1
once	1
admitted	1
in	1
private,	1
that	1
ever	1
since	1
he	1
had	1
arisen	1
to	1
the	1
dignity	1
of	1
an	1
officer,	1
from	1
that	1
moment	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
known	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
otherwise	1
than	1
hungry,	1
more	1
or	1
less.	1
For	1
what	1
he	1
ate	1
did	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
relieve	1
his	1
hunger,	1
as	1
keep	1
it	1
immortal	1
in	1
him.	1
Peace	1
and	1
satisfaction,	1
thought	1
Flask,	1
have	1
for	1
ever	1
departed	1
from	1
my	1
stomach.	1
I	1
am	1
an	1
officer;	1
but,	1
how	1
I	1
wish	1
I	1
could	1
fish	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
old-fashioned	1
beef	1
in	1
the	1
forecastle,	1
as	1
I	1
used	1
to	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
before	1
the	1
mast.	1
There's	1
the	1
fruits	1
of	1
promotion	1
now;	1
there's	1
the	1
vanity	1
of	1
glory:	1
there's	1
the	1
insanity	1
of	1
life!	1
Besides,	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
so	1
that	1
any	1
mere	1
sailor	1
of	1
the	1
Pequod	1
had	1
a	1
grudge	1
against	1
Flask	1
in	1
Flask's	1
official	1
capacity,	1
all	1
that	1
sailor	1
had	1
to	1
do,	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
obtain	1
ample	1
vengeance,	1
was	1
to	1
go	1
aft	1
at	1
dinner-time,	1
and	1
get	1
a	1
peep	1
at	1
Flask	1
through	1
the	1
cabin	1
sky-light,	1
sitting	1
silly	1
and	1
dumfoundered	1
before	1
awful	1
Ahab.	1
Now,	1
Ahab	1
and	1
his	1
three	1
mates	1
formed	1
what	1
may	1
be	1
called	1
the	1
first	1
table	1
in	1
the	1
Pequod's	1
cabin.	1
After	1
their	1
departure,	1
taking	1
place	1
in	1
inverted	1
order	1
to	1
their	1
arrival,	1
the	1
canvas	1
cloth	1
was	1
cleared,	1
or	1
rather	1
was	1
restored	1
to	1
some	1
hurried	1
order	1
by	1
the	1
pallid	1
steward.	1
And	1
then	1
the	1
three	1
harpooneers	1
were	1
bidden	1
to	1
the	1
feast,	1
they	1
being	1
its	1
residuary	1
legatees.	1
They	1
made	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
temporary	1
servants'	1
hall	1
of	1
the	1
high	1
and	1
mighty	1
cabin.	1
In	1
strange	1
contrast	1
to	1
the	1
hardly	1
tolerable	1
constraint	1
and	1
nameless	1
invisible	1
domineerings	1
of	1
the	1
captain's	1
table,	1
was	1
the	1
entire	1
care-free	1
license	1
and	1
ease,	1
the	1
almost	1
frantic	1
democracy	1
of	1
those	1
inferior	1
fellows	1
the	1
harpooneers.	1
While	1
their	1
masters,	1
the	1
mates,	1
seemed	1
afraid	1
of	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
hinges	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
jaws,	1
the	1
harpooneers	1
chewed	1
their	1
food	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
relish	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
report	1
to	1
it.	1
They	1
dined	1
like	1
lords;	1
they	1
filled	1
their	1
bellies	1
like	1
Indian	1
ships	1
all	1
day	1
loading	1
with	1
spices.	1
Such	1
portentous	1
appetites	1
had	1
Queequeg	1
and	1
Tashtego,	1
that	1
to	1
fill	1
out	1
the	1
vacancies	1
made	1
by	1
the	1
previous	1
repast,	1
often	1
the	1
pale	1
Dough-Boy	1
was	1
fain	1
to	1
bring	1
on	1
a	1
great	1
baron	1
of	1
salt-junk,	1
seemingly	1
quarried	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
solid	1
ox.	1
And	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
not	1
lively	1
about	1
it,	1
if	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
with	1
a	1
nimble	1
hop-skip-and-jump,	1
then	1
Tashtego	1
had	1
an	1
ungentlemanly	1
way	1
of	1
accelerating	1
him	1
by	1
darting	1
a	1
fork	1
at	1
his	1
back,	1
harpoon-wise.	1
And	1
once	1
Daggoo,	1
seized	1
with	1
a	1
sudden	1
humor,	1
assisted	1
Dough-Boy's	1
memory	1
by	1
snatching	1
him	1
up	1
bodily,	1
and	1
thrusting	1
his	1
head	1
into	1
a	1
great	1
empty	1
wooden	1
trencher,	1
while	1
Tashtego,	1
knife	1
in	1
hand,	1
began	1
laying	1
out	1
the	1
circle	1
preliminary	1
to	1
scalping	1
him.	1
He	1
was	1
naturally	1
a	1
very	1
nervous,	1
shuddering	1
sort	1
of	1
little	1
fellow,	1
this	1
bread-faced	1
steward;	1
the	1
progeny	1
of	1
a	1
bankrupt	1
baker	1
and	1
a	1
hospital	1
nurse.	1
And	1
what	1
with	1
the	1
standing	1
spectacle	1
of	1
the	1
black	1
terrific	1
Ahab,	1
and	1
the	1
periodical	1
tumultuous	1
visitations	1
of	1
these	1
three	1
savages,	1
Dough-Boy's	1
whole	1
life	1
was	1
one	1
continual	1
lip-quiver.	1
Commonly,	1
after	1
seeing	1
the	1
harpooneers	1
furnished	1
with	1
all	1
things	1
they	1
demanded,	1
he	1
would	1
escape	1
from	1
their	1
clutches	1
into	1
his	1
little	1
pantry	1
adjoining,	1
and	1
fearfully	1
peep	1
out	1
at	1
them	1
through	1
the	1
blinds	1
of	1
its	1
door,	1
till	1
all	1
was	1
over.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
sight	1
to	1
see	1
Queequeg	1
seated	1
over	1
against	1
Tashtego,	1
opposing	1
his	1
filed	1
teeth	1
to	1
the	1
Indian's:	1
crosswise	1
to	1
them,	1
Daggoo	1
seated	1
on	1
the	1
floor,	1
for	1
a	1
bench	1
would	1
have	1
brought	1
his	1
hearse-plumed	1
head	1
to	1
the	1
low	1
carlines;	1
at	1
every	1
motion	1
of	1
his	1
colossal	1
limbs,	1
making	1
the	1
low	1
cabin	1
framework	1
to	1
shake,	1
as	1
when	1
an	1
African	1
elephant	1
goes	1
passenger	1
in	1
a	1
ship.	1
But	1
for	1
all	1
this,	1
the	1
great	1
negro	1
was	1
wonderfully	1
abstemious,	1
not	1
to	1
say	1
dainty.	1
It	1
seemed	1
hardly	1
possible	1
that	1
by	1
such	1
comparatively	1
small	1
mouthfuls	1
he	1
could	1
keep	1
up	1
the	1
vitality	1
diffused	1
through	1
so	1
broad,	1
baronial,	1
and	1
superb	1
a	1
person.	1
But,	1
doubtless,	1
this	1
noble	1
savage	1
fed	1
strong	1
and	1
drank	1
deep	1
of	1
the	1
abounding	1
element	1
of	1
air;	1
and	1
through	1
his	1
dilated	1
nostrils	1
snuffed	1
in	1
the	1
sublime	1
life	1
of	1
the	1
worlds.	1
Not	1
by	1
beef	1
or	1
by	1
bread,	1
are	1
giants	1
made	1
or	1
nourished.	1
But	1
Queequeg,	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
mortal,	1
barbaric	1
smack	1
of	1
the	1
lip	1
in	1
eating--an	1
ugly	1
sound	1
enough--so	1
much	1
so,	1
that	1
the	1
trembling	1
Dough-Boy	1
almost	1
looked	1
to	1
see	1
whether	1
any	1
marks	1
of	1
teeth	1
lurked	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
lean	1
arms.	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
would	1
hear	1
Tashtego	1
singing	1
out	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
produce	1
himself,	1
that	1
his	1
bones	1
might	1
be	1
picked,	1
the	1
simple-witted	1
steward	1
all	1
but	1
shattered	1
the	1
crockery	1
hanging	1
round	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
pantry,	1
by	1
his	1
sudden	1
fits	1
of	1
the	1
palsy.	1
Nor	1
did	1
the	1
whetstone	1
which	1
the	1
harpooneers	1
carried	1
in	1
their	1
pockets,	1
for	1
their	1
lances	1
and	1
other	1
weapons;	1
and	1
with	1
which	1
whetstones,	1
at	1
dinner,	1
they	1
would	1
ostentatiously	1
sharpen	1
their	1
knives;	1
that	1
grating	1
sound	1
did	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
tend	1
to	1
tranquillize	1
poor	1
Dough-Boy.	1
How	1
could	1
he	1
forget	1
that	1
in	1
his	1
Island	1
days,	1
Queequeg,	1
for	1
one,	1
must	1
certainly	1
have	1
been	1
guilty	1
of	1
some	1
murderous,	1
convivial	1
indiscretions.	1
Alas!	1
Dough-Boy!	1
hard	1
fares	1
the	1
white	1
waiter	1
who	1
waits	1
upon	1
cannibals.	1
Not	1
a	1
napkin	1
should	1
he	1
carry	1
on	1
his	1
arm,	1
but	1
a	1
buckler.	1
In	1
good	1
time,	1
though,	1
to	1
his	1
great	1
delight,	1
the	1
three	1
salt-sea	1
warriors	1
would	1
rise	1
and	1
depart;	1
to	1
his	1
credulous,	1
fable-mongering	1
ears,	1
all	1
their	1
martial	1
bones	1
jingling	1
in	1
them	1
at	1
every	1
step,	1
like	1
Moorish	1
scimetars	1
in	1
scabbards.	1
But,	1
though	1
these	1
barbarians	1
dined	1
in	1
the	1
cabin,	1
and	1
nominally	1
lived	1
there;	1
still,	1
being	1
anything	1
but	1
sedentary	1
in	1
their	1
habits,	1
they	1
were	1
scarcely	1
ever	1
in	1
it	1
except	1
at	1
mealtimes,	1
and	1
just	1
before	1
sleeping-time,	1
when	1
they	1
passed	1
through	1
it	1
to	1
their	1
own	1
peculiar	1
quarters.	1
In	1
this	1
one	1
matter,	1
Ahab	1
seemed	1
no	1
exception	1
to	1
most	1
American	1
whale	1
captains,	1
who,	1
as	1
a	1
set,	1
rather	1
incline	1
to	1
the	1
opinion	1
that	1
by	1
rights	1
the	1
ship's	1
cabin	1
belongs	1
to	1
them;	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
by	1
courtesy	1
alone	1
that	1
anybody	1
else	1
is,	1
at	1
any	1
time,	1
permitted	1
there.	1
So	1
that,	1
in	1
real	1
truth,	1
the	1
mates	1
and	1
harpooneers	1
of	1
the	1
Pequod	1
might	1
more	1
properly	1
be	1
said	1
to	1
have	1
lived	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
cabin	1
than	1
in	1
it.	1
For	1
when	1
they	1
did	1
enter	1
it,	1
it	1
was	1
something	1
as	1
a	1
street-door	1
enters	1
a	1
house;	1
turning	1
inwards	1
for	1
a	1
moment,	1
only	1
to	1
be	1
turned	1
out	1
the	1
next;	1
and,	1
as	1
a	1
permanent	1
thing,	1
residing	1
in	1
the	1
open	1
air.	1
Nor	1
did	1
they	1
lose	1
much	1
hereby;	1
in	1
the	1
cabin	1
was	1
no	1
companionship;	1
socially,	1
Ahab	1
was	1
inaccessible.	1
Though	1
nominally	1
included	1
in	1
the	1
census	1
of	1
Christendom,	1
he	1
was	1
still	1
an	1
alien	1
to	1
it.	1
He	1
lived	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
as	1
the	1
last	1
of	1
the	1
Grisly	1
Bears	1
lived	1
in	1
settled	1
Missouri.	1
And	1
as	1
when	1
Spring	1
and	1
Summer	1
had	1
departed,	1
that	1
wild	1
Logan	1
of	1
the	1
woods,	1
burying	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
hollow	1
of	1
a	1
tree,	1
lived	1
out	1
the	1
winter	1
there,	1
sucking	1
his	1
own	1
paws;	1
so,	1
in	1
his	1
inclement,	1
howling	1
old	1
age,	1
Ahab's	1
soul,	1
shut	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
caved	1
trunk	1
of	1
his	1
body,	1
there	1
fed	1
upon	1
the	1
sullen	1
paws	1
of	1
its	1
gloom!	1
CHAPTER	1
35	1
The	1
Mast-Head.	1
It	1
was	1
during	1
the	1
more	1
pleasant	1
weather,	1
that	1
in	1
due	1
rotation	1
with	1
the	1
other	1
seamen	1
my	1
first	1
mast-head	1
came	1
round.	1
In	1
most	1
American	1
whalemen	1
the	1
mast-heads	1
are	1
manned	1
almost	1
simultaneously	1
with	1
the	1
vessel's	1
leaving	1
her	1
port;	1
even	1
though	1
she	1
may	1
have	1
fifteen	1
thousand	1
miles,	1
and	1
more,	1
to	1
sail	1
ere	1
reaching	1
her	1
proper	1
cruising	1
ground.	1
And	1
if,	1
after	1
a	1
three,	1
four,	1
or	1
five	1
years'	1
voyage	1
she	1
is	1
drawing	1
nigh	1
home	1
with	1
anything	1
empty	1
in	1
her--say,	1
an	1
empty	1
vial	1
even--then,	1
her	1
mast-heads	1
are	1
kept	1
manned	1
to	1
the	1
last;	1
and	1
not	1
till	1
her	1
skysail-poles	1
sail	1
in	1
among	1
the	1
spires	1
of	1
the	1
port,	1
does	1
she	1
altogether	1
relinquish	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
capturing	1
one	1
whale	1
more.	1
Now,	1
as	1
the	1
business	1
of	1
standing	1
mast-heads,	1
ashore	1
or	1
afloat,	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
ancient	1
and	1
interesting	1
one,	1
let	1
us	1
in	1
some	1
measure	1
expatiate	1
here.	1
I	1
take	1
it,	1
that	1
the	1
earliest	1
standers	1
of	1
mast-heads	1
were	1
the	1
old	1
Egyptians;	1
because,	1
in	1
all	1
my	1
researches,	1
I	1
find	1
none	1
prior	1
to	1
them.	1
For	1
though	1
their	1
progenitors,	1
the	1
builders	1
of	1
Babel,	1
must	1
doubtless,	1
by	1
their	1
tower,	1
have	1
intended	1
to	1
rear	1
the	1
loftiest	1
mast-head	1
in	1
all	1
Asia,	1
or	1
Africa	1
either;	1
yet	1
(ere	1
the	1
final	1
truck	1
was	1
put	1
to	1
it)	1
as	1
that	1
great	1
stone	1
mast	1
of	1
theirs	1
may	1
be	1
said	1
to	1
have	1
gone	1
by	1
the	1
board,	1
in	1
the	1
dread	1
gale	1
of	1
God's	1
wrath;	1
therefore,	1
we	1
cannot	1
give	1
these	1
Babel	1
builders	1
priority	1
over	1
the	1
Egyptians.	1
And	1
that	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
were	1
a	1
nation	1
of	1
mast-head	1
standers,	1
is	1
an	1
assertion	1
based	1
upon	1
the	1
general	1
belief	1
among	1
archaeologists,	1
that	1
the	1
first	1
pyramids	1
were	1
founded	1
for	1
astronomical	1
purposes:	1
a	1
theory	1
singularly	1
supported	1
by	1
the	1
peculiar	1
stair-like	1
formation	1
of	1
all	1
four	1
sides	1
of	1
those	1
edifices;	1
whereby,	1
with	1
prodigious	1
long	1
upliftings	1
of	1
their	1
legs,	1
those	1
old	1
astronomers	1
were	1
wont	1
to	1
mount	1
to	1
the	1
apex,	1
and	1
sing	1
out	1
for	1
new	1
stars;	1
even	1
as	1
the	1
look-outs	1
of	1
a	1
modern	1
ship	1
sing	1
out	1
for	1
a	1
sail,	1
or	1
a	1
whale	1
just	1
bearing	1
in	1
sight.	1
In	1
Saint	1
Stylites,	1
the	1
famous	1
Christian	1
hermit	1
of	1
old	1
times,	1
who	1
built	1
him	1
a	1
lofty	1
stone	1
pillar	1
in	1
the	1
desert	1
and	1
spent	1
the	1
whole	1
latter	1
portion	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
on	1
its	1
summit,	1
hoisting	1
his	1
food	1
from	1
the	1
ground	1
with	1
a	1
tackle;	1
in	1
him	1
we	1
have	1
a	1
remarkable	1
instance	1
of	1
a	1
dauntless	1
stander-of-mast-heads;	1
who	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
driven	1
from	1
his	1
place	1
by	1
fogs	1
or	1
frosts,	1
rain,	1
hail,	1
or	1
sleet;	1
but	1
valiantly	1
facing	1
everything	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
last,	1
literally	1
died	1
at	1
his	1
post.	1
Of	1
modern	1
standers-of-mast-heads	1
we	1
have	1
but	1
a	1
lifeless	1
set;	1
mere	1
stone,	1
iron,	1
and	1
bronze	1
men;	1
who,	1
though	1
well	1
capable	1
of	1
facing	1
out	1
a	1
stiff	1
gale,	1
are	1
still	1
entirely	1
incompetent	1
to	1
the	1
business	1
of	1
singing	1
out	1
upon	1
discovering	1
any	1
strange	1
sight.	1
There	1
is	1
Napoleon;	1
who,	1
upon	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
column	1
of	1
Vendome,	1
stands	1
with	1
arms	1
folded,	1
some	1
one	1
hundred	1
and	1
fifty	1
feet	1
in	1
the	1
air;	1
careless,	1
now,	1
who	1
rules	1
the	1
decks	1
below;	1
whether	1
Louis	1
Philippe,	1
Louis	1
Blanc,	1
or	1
Louis	1
the	1
Devil.	1
Great	1
Washington,	1
too,	1
stands	1
high	1
aloft	1
on	1
his	1
towering	1
main-mast	1
in	1
Baltimore,	1
and	1
like	1
one	1
of	1
Hercules'	1
pillars,	1
his	1
column	1
marks	1
that	1
point	1
of	1
human	1
grandeur	1
beyond	1
which	1
few	1
mortals	1
will	1
go.	1
Admiral	1
Nelson,	1
also,	1
on	1
a	1
capstan	1
of	1
gun-metal,	1
stands	1
his	1
mast-head	1
in	1
Trafalgar	1
Square;	1
and	1
ever	1
when	1
most	1
obscured	1
by	1
that	1
London	1
smoke,	1
token	1
is	1
yet	1
given	1
that	1
a	1
hidden	1
hero	1
is	1
there;	1
for	1
where	1
there	1
is	1
smoke,	1
must	1
be	1
fire.	1
But	1
neither	1
great	1
Washington,	1
nor	1
Napoleon,	1
nor	1
Nelson,	1
will	1
answer	1
a	1
single	1
hail	1
from	1
below,	1
however	1
madly	1
invoked	1
to	1
befriend	1
by	1
their	1
counsels	1
the	1
distracted	1
decks	1
upon	1
which	1
they	1
gaze;	1
however	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
surmised,	1
that	1
their	1
spirits	1
penetrate	1
through	1
the	1
thick	1
haze	1
of	1
the	1
future,	1
and	1
descry	1
what	1
shoals	1
and	1
what	1
rocks	1
must	1
be	1
shunned.	1
It	1
may	1
seem	1
unwarrantable	1
to	1
couple	1
in	1
any	1
respect	1
the	1
mast-head	1
standers	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
with	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
sea;	1
but	1
that	1
in	1
truth	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
so,	1
is	1
plainly	1
evinced	1
by	1
an	1
item	1
for	1
which	1
Obed	1
Macy,	1
the	1
sole	1
historian	1
of	1
Nantucket,	1
stands	1
accountable.	1
The	1
worthy	1
Obed	1
tells	1
us,	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
early	1
times	1
of	1
the	1
whale	1
fishery,	1
ere	1
ships	1
were	1
regularly	1
launched	1
in	1
pursuit	1
of	1
the	1
game,	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
that	1
island	1
erected	1
lofty	1
spars	1
along	1
the	1
sea-coast,	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
look-outs	1
ascended	1
by	1
means	1
of	1
nailed	1
cleats,	1
something	1
as	1
fowls	1
go	1
upstairs	1
in	1
a	1
hen-house.	1
A	1
few	1
years	1
ago	1
this	1
same	1
plan	1
was	1
adopted	1
by	1
the	1
Bay	1
whalemen	1
of	1
New	1
Zealand,	1
who,	1
upon	1
descrying	1
the	1
game,	1
gave	1
notice	1
to	1
the	1
ready-manned	1
boats	1
nigh	1
the	1
beach.	1
But	1
this	1
custom	1
has	1
now	1
become	1
obsolete;	1
turn	1
we	1
then	1
to	1
the	1
one	1
proper	1
mast-head,	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
whale-ship	1
at	1
sea.	1
The	1
three	1
mast-heads	1
are	1
kept	1
manned	1
from	1
sun-rise	1
to	1
sun-set;	1
the	1
seamen	1
taking	1
their	1
regular	1
turns	1
(as	1
at	1
the	1
helm),	1
and	1
relieving	1
each	1
other	1
every	1
two	1
hours.	1
In	1
the	1
serene	1
weather	1
of	1
the	1
tropics	1
it	1
is	1
exceedingly	1
pleasant	1
the	1
mast-head;	1
nay,	1
to	1
a	1
dreamy	1
meditative	1
man	1
it	1
is	1
delightful.	1
There	1
you	1
stand,	1
a	1
hundred	1
feet	1
above	1
the	1
silent	1
decks,	1
striding	1
along	1
the	1
deep,	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
masts	1
were	1
gigantic	1
stilts,	1
while	1
beneath	1
you	1
and	1
between	1
your	1
legs,	1
as	1
it	1
were,	1
swim	1
the	1
hugest	1
monsters	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
even	1
as	1
ships	1
once	1
sailed	1
between	1
the	1
boots	1
of	1
the	1
famous	1
Colossus	1
at	1
old	1
Rhodes.	1
There	1
you	1
stand,	1
lost	1
in	1
the	1
infinite	1
series	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
with	1
nothing	1
ruffled	1
but	1
the	1
waves.	1
The	1
tranced	1
ship	1
indolently	1
rolls;	1
the	1
drowsy	1
trade	1
winds	1
blow;	1
everything	1
resolves	1
you	1
into	1
languor.	1
For	1
the	1
most	1
part,	1
in	1
this	1
tropic	1
whaling	1
life,	1
a	1
sublime	1
uneventfulness	1
invests	1
you;	1
you	1
hear	1
no	1
news;	1
read	1
no	1
gazettes;	1
extras	1
with	1
startling	1
accounts	1
of	1
commonplaces	1
never	1
delude	1
you	1
into	1
unnecessary	1
excitements;	1
you	1
hear	1
of	1
no	1
domestic	1
afflictions;	1
bankrupt	1
securities;	1
fall	1
of	1
stocks;	1
are	1
never	1
troubled	1
with	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
what	1
you	1
shall	1
have	1
for	1
dinner--for	1
all	1
your	1
meals	1
for	1
three	1
years	1
and	1
more	1
are	1
snugly	1
stowed	1
in	1
casks,	1
and	1
your	1
bill	1
of	1
fare	1
is	1
immutable.	1
In	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
southern	1
whalesmen,	1
on	1
a	1
long	1
three	1
or	1
four	1
years'	1
voyage,	1
as	1
often	1
happens,	1
the	1
sum	1
of	1
the	1
various	1
hours	1
you	1
spend	1
at	1
the	1
mast-head	1
would	1
amount	1
to	1
several	1
entire	1
months.	1
And	1
it	1
is	1
much	1
to	1
be	1
deplored	1
that	1
the	1
place	1
to	1
which	1
you	1
devote	1
so	1
considerable	1
a	1
portion	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
term	1
of	1
your	1
natural	1
life,	1
should	1
be	1
so	1
sadly	1
destitute	1
of	1
anything	1
approaching	1
to	1
a	1
cosy	1
inhabitiveness,	1
or	1
adapted	1
to	1
breed	1
a	1
comfortable	1
localness	1
of	1
feeling,	1
such	1
as	1
pertains	1
to	1
a	1
bed,	1
a	1
hammock,	1
a	1
hearse,	1
a	1
sentry	1
box,	1
a	1
pulpit,	1
a	1
coach,	1
or	1
any	1
other	1
of	1
those	1
small	1
and	1
snug	1
contrivances	1
in	1
which	1
men	1
temporarily	1
isolate	1
themselves.	1
Your	1
most	1
usual	1
point	1
of	1
perch	1
is	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
t'	1
gallant-mast,	1
where	1
you	1
stand	1
upon	1
two	1
thin	1
parallel	1
sticks	1
(almost	1
peculiar	1
to	1
whalemen)	1
called	1
the	1
t'	1
gallant	1
cross-trees.	1
Here,	1
tossed	1
about	1
by	1
the	1
sea,	1
the	1
beginner	1
feels	1
about	1
as	1
cosy	1
as	1
he	1
would	1
standing	1
on	1
a	1
bull's	1
horns.	1
To	1
be	1
sure,	1
in	1
cold	1
weather	1
you	1
may	1
carry	1
your	1
house	1
aloft	1
with	1
you,	1
in	1
the	1
shape	1
of	1
a	1
watch-coat;	1
but	1
properly	1
speaking	1
the	1
thickest	1
watch-coat	1
is	1
no	1
more	1
of	1
a	1
house	1
than	1
the	1
unclad	1
body;	1
for	1
as	1
the	1
soul	1
is	1
glued	1
inside	1
of	1
its	1
fleshy	1
tabernacle,	1
and	1
cannot	1
freely	1
move	1
about	1
in	1
it,	1
nor	1
even	1
move	1
out	1
of	1
it,	1
without	1
running	1
great	1
risk	1
of	1
perishing	1
(like	1
an	1
ignorant	1
pilgrim	1
crossing	1
the	1
snowy	1
Alps	1
in	1
winter);	1
so	1
a	1
watch-coat	1
is	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
of	1
a	1
house	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
mere	1
envelope,	1
or	1
additional	1
skin	1
encasing	1
you.	1
You	1
cannot	1
put	1
a	1
shelf	1
or	1
chest	1
of	1
drawers	1
in	1
your	1
body,	1
and	1
no	1
more	1
can	1
you	1
make	1
a	1
convenient	1
closet	1
of	1
your	1
watch-coat.	1
Concerning	1
all	1
this,	1
it	1
is	1
much	1
to	1
be	1
deplored	1
that	1
the	1
mast-heads	1
of	1
a	1
southern	1
whale	1
ship	1
are	1
unprovided	1
with	1
those	1
enviable	1
little	1
tents	1
or	1
pulpits,	1
called	1
CROW'S-NESTS,	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
look-outs	1
of	1
a	1
Greenland	1
whaler	1
are	1
protected	1
from	1
the	1
inclement	1
weather	1
of	1
the	1
frozen	1
seas.	1
In	1
the	1
fireside	1
narrative	1
of	1
Captain	1
Sleet,	1
entitled	1
"A	1
Voyage	1
among	1
the	1
Icebergs,	1
in	1
quest	1
of	1
the	1
Greenland	1
Whale,	1
and	1
incidentally	1
for	1
the	1
re-discovery	1
of	1
the	1
Lost	1
Icelandic	1
Colonies	1
of	1
Old	1
Greenland;"	1
in	1
this	1
admirable	1
volume,	1
all	1
standers	1
of	1
mast-heads	1
are	1
furnished	1
with	1
a	1
charmingly	1
circumstantial	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
then	1
recently	1
invented	1
CROW'S-NEST	1
of	1
the	1
Glacier,	1
which	1
was	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Captain	1
Sleet's	1
good	1
craft.	1
He	1
called	1
it	1
the	1
SLEET'S	1
CROW'S-NEST,	1
in	1
honour	1
of	1
himself;	1
he	1
being	1
the	1
original	1
inventor	1
and	1
patentee,	1
and	1
free	1
from	1
all	1
ridiculous	1
false	1
delicacy,	1
and	1
holding	1
that	1
if	1
we	1
call	1
our	1
own	1
children	1
after	1
our	1
own	1
names	1
(we	1
fathers	1
being	1
the	1
original	1
inventors	1
and	1
patentees),	1
so	1
likewise	1
should	1
we	1
denominate	1
after	1
ourselves	1
any	1
other	1
apparatus	1
we	1
may	1
beget.	1
In	1
shape,	1
the	1
Sleet's	1
crow's-nest	1
is	1
something	1
like	1
a	1
large	1
tierce	1
or	1
pipe;	1
it	1
is	1
open	1
above,	1
however,	1
where	1
it	1
is	1
furnished	1
with	1
a	1
movable	1
side-screen	1
to	1
keep	1
to	1
windward	1
of	1
your	1
head	1
in	1
a	1
hard	1
gale.	1
Being	1
fixed	1
on	1
the	1
summit	1
of	1
the	1
mast,	1
you	1
ascend	1
into	1
it	1
through	1
a	1
little	1
trap-hatch	1
in	1
the	1
bottom.	1
On	1
the	1
after	1
side,	1
or	1
side	1
next	1
the	1
stern	1
of	1
the	1
ship,	1
is	1
a	1
comfortable	1
seat,	1
with	1
a	1
locker	1
underneath	1
for	1
umbrellas,	1
comforters,	1
and	1
coats.	1
In	1
front	1
is	1
a	1
leather	1
rack,	1
in	1
which	1
to	1
keep	1
your	1
speaking	1
trumpet,	1
pipe,	1
telescope,	1
and	1
other	1
nautical	1
conveniences.	1
When	1
Captain	1
Sleet	1
in	1
person	1
stood	1
his	1
mast-head	1
in	1
this	1
crow's-nest	1
of	1
his,	1
he	1
tells	1
us	1
that	1
he	1
always	1
had	1
a	1
rifle	1
with	1
him	1
(also	1
fixed	1
in	1
the	1
rack),	1
together	1
with	1
a	1
powder	1
flask	1
and	1
shot,	1
for	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
popping	1
off	1
the	1
stray	1
narwhales,	1
or	1
vagrant	1
sea	1
unicorns	1
infesting	1
those	1
waters;	1
for	1
you	1
cannot	1
successfully	1
shoot	1
at	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
deck	1
owing	1
to	1
the	1
resistance	1
of	1
the	1
water,	1
but	1
to	1
shoot	1
down	1
upon	1
them	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
different	1
thing.	1
Now,	1
it	1
was	1
plainly	1
a	1
labor	1
of	1
love	1
for	1
Captain	1
Sleet	1
to	1
describe,	1
as	1
he	1
does,	1
all	1
the	1
little	1
detailed	1
conveniences	1
of	1
his	1
crow's-nest;	1
but	1
though	1
he	1
so	1
enlarges	1
upon	1
many	1
of	1
these,	1
and	1
though	1
he	1
treats	1
us	1
to	1
a	1
very	1
scientific	1
account	1
of	1
his	1
experiments	1
in	1
this	1
crow's-nest,	1
with	1
a	1
small	1
compass	1
he	1
kept	1
there	1
for	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
counteracting	1
the	1
errors	1
resulting	1
from	1
what	1
is	1
called	1
the	1
"local	1
attraction"	1
of	1
all	1
binnacle	1
magnets;	1
an	1
error	1
ascribable	1
to	1
the	1
horizontal	1
vicinity	1
of	1
the	1
iron	1
in	1
the	1
ship's	1
planks,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
Glacier's	1
case,	1
perhaps,	1
to	1
there	1
having	1
been	1
so	1
many	1
broken-down	1
blacksmiths	1
among	1
her	1
crew;	1
I	1
say,	1
that	1
though	1
the	1
Captain	1
is	1
very	1
discreet	1
and	1
scientific	1
here,	1
yet,	1
for	1
all	1
his	1
learned	1
"binnacle	1
deviations,"	1
"azimuth	1
compass	1
observations,"	1
and	1
"approximate	1
errors,"	1
he	1
knows	1
very	1
well,	1
Captain	1
Sleet,	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
immersed	1
in	1
those	1
profound	1
magnetic	1
meditations,	1
as	1
to	1
fail	1
being	1
attracted	1
occasionally	1
towards	1
that	1
well	1
replenished	1
little	1
case-bottle,	1
so	1
nicely	1
tucked	1
in	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
his	1
crow's	1
nest,	1
within	1
easy	1
reach	1
of	1
his	1
hand.	1
Though,	1
upon	1
the	1
whole,	1
I	1
greatly	1
admire	1
and	1
even	1
love	1
the	1
brave,	1
the	1
honest,	1
and	1
learned	1
Captain;	1
yet	1
I	1
take	1
it	1
very	1
ill	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
so	1
utterly	1
ignore	1
that	1
case-bottle,	1
seeing	1
what	1
a	1
faithful	1
friend	1
and	1
comforter	1
it	1
must	1
have	1
been,	1
while	1
with	1
mittened	1
fingers	1
and	1
hooded	1
head	1
he	1
was	1
studying	1
the	1
mathematics	1
aloft	1
there	1
in	1
that	1
bird's	1
nest	1
within	1
three	1
or	1
four	1
perches	1
of	1
the	1
pole.	1
But	1
if	1
we	1
Southern	1
whale-fishers	1
are	1
not	1
so	1
snugly	1
housed	1
aloft	1
as	1
Captain	1
Sleet	1
and	1
his	1
Greenlandmen	1
were;	1
yet	1
that	1
disadvantage	1
is	1
greatly	1
counter-balanced	1
by	1
the	1
widely	1
contrasting	1
serenity	1
of	1
those	1
seductive	1
seas	1
in	1
which	1
we	1
South	1
fishers	1
mostly	1
float.	1
For	1
one,	1
I	1
used	1
to	1
lounge	1
up	1
the	1
rigging	1
very	1
leisurely,	1
resting	1
in	1
the	1
top	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
chat	1
with	1
Queequeg,	1
or	1
any	1
one	1
else	1
off	1
duty	1
whom	1
I	1
might	1
find	1
there;	1
then	1
ascending	1
a	1
little	1
way	1
further,	1
and	1
throwing	1
a	1
lazy	1
leg	1
over	1
the	1
top-sail	1
yard,	1
take	1
a	1
preliminary	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
watery	1
pastures,	1
and	1
so	1
at	1
last	1
mount	1
to	1
my	1
ultimate	1
destination.	1
Let	1
me	1
make	1
a	1
clean	1
breast	1
of	1
it	1
here,	1
and	1
frankly	1
admit	1
that	1
I	1
kept	1
but	1
sorry	1
guard.	1
With	1
the	1
problem	1
of	1
the	1
universe	1
revolving	1
in	1
me,	1
how	1
could	1
I--being	1
left	1
completely	1
to	1
myself	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
thought-engendering	1
altitude--how	1
could	1
I	1
but	1
lightly	1
hold	1
my	1
obligations	1
to	1
observe	1
all	1
whale-ships'	1
standing	1
orders,	1
"Keep	1
your	1
weather	1
eye	1
open,	1
and	1
sing	1
out	1
every	1
time."	1
And	1
let	1
me	1
in	1
this	1
place	1
movingly	1
admonish	1
you,	1
ye	1
ship-owners	1
of	1
Nantucket!	1
Beware	1
of	1
enlisting	1
in	1
your	1
vigilant	1
fisheries	1
any	1
lad	1
with	1
lean	1
brow	1
and	1
hollow	1
eye;	1
given	1
to	1
unseasonable	1
meditativeness;	1
and	1
who	1
offers	1
to	1
ship	1
with	1
the	1
Phaedon	1
instead	1
of	1
Bowditch	1
in	1
his	1
head.	1
Beware	1
of	1
such	1
an	1
one,	1
I	1
say;	1
your	1
whales	1
must	1
be	1
seen	1
before	1
they	1
can	1
be	1
killed;	1
and	1
this	1
sunken-eyed	1
young	1
Platonist	1
will	1
tow	1
you	1
ten	1
wakes	1
round	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
never	1
make	1
you	1
one	1
pint	1
of	1
sperm	1
the	1
richer.	1
Nor	1
are	1
these	1
monitions	1
at	1
all	1
unneeded.	1
For	1
nowadays,	1
the	1
whale-fishery	1
furnishes	1
an	1
asylum	1
for	1
many	1
romantic,	1
melancholy,	1
and	1
absent-minded	1
young	1
men,	1
disgusted	1
with	1
the	1
carking	1
cares	1
of	1
earth,	1
and	1
seeking	1
sentiment	1
in	1
tar	1
and	1
blubber.	1
Childe	1
Harold	1
not	1
unfrequently	1
perches	1
himself	1
upon	1
the	1
mast-head	1
of	1
some	1
luckless	1
disappointed	1
whale-ship,	1
and	1
in	1
moody	1
phrase	1
ejaculates:--	1
"Roll	1
on,	1
thou	1
deep	1
and	1
dark	1
blue	1
ocean,	1
roll!	1
Ten	1
thousand	1
blubber-hunters	1
sweep	1
over	1
thee	1
in	1
vain."	1
Very	1
often	1
do	1
the	1
captains	1
of	1
such	1
ships	1
take	1
those	1
absent-minded	1
young	1
philosophers	1
to	1
task,	1
upbraiding	1
them	1
with	1
not	1
feeling	1
sufficient	1
"interest"	1
in	1
the	1
voyage;	1
half-hinting	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
so	1
hopelessly	1
lost	1
to	1
all	1
honourable	1
ambition,	1
as	1
that	1
in	1
their	1
secret	1
souls	1
they	1
would	1
rather	1
not	1
see	1
whales	1
than	1
otherwise.	1
But	1
all	1
in	1
vain;	1
those	1
young	1
Platonists	1
have	1
a	1
notion	1
that	1
their	1
vision	1
is	1
imperfect;	1
they	1
are	1
short-sighted;	1
what	1
use,	1
then,	1
to	1
strain	1
the	1
visual	1
nerve?	1
They	1
have	1
left	1
their	1
opera-glasses	1
at	1
home.	1
"Why,	1
thou	1
monkey,"	1
said	1
a	1
harpooneer	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
lads,	1
"we've	1
been	1
cruising	1
now	1
hard	1
upon	1
three	1
years,	1
and	1
thou	1
hast	1
not	1
raised	1
a	1
whale	1
yet.	1
Whales	1
are	1
scarce	1
as	1
hen's	1
teeth	1
whenever	1
thou	1
art	1
up	1
here."	1
Perhaps	1
they	1
were;	1
or	1
perhaps	1
there	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
shoals	1
of	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
far	1
horizon;	1
but	1
lulled	1
into	1
such	1
an	1
opium-like	1
listlessness	1
of	1
vacant,	1
unconscious	1
reverie	1
is	1
this	1
absent-minded	1
youth	1
by	1
the	1
blending	1
cadence	1
of	1
waves	1
with	1
thoughts,	1
that	1
at	1
last	1
he	1
loses	1
his	1
identity;	1
takes	1
the	1
mystic	1
ocean	1
at	1
his	1
feet	1
for	1
the	1
visible	1
image	1
of	1
that	1
deep,	1
blue,	1
bottomless	1
soul,	1
pervading	1
mankind	1
and	1
nature;	1
and	1
every	1
strange,	1
half-seen,	1
gliding,	1
beautiful	1
thing	1
that	1
eludes	1
him;	1
every	1
dimly-discovered,	1
uprising	1
fin	1
of	1
some	1
undiscernible	1
form,	1
seems	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
embodiment	1
of	1
those	1
elusive	1
thoughts	1
that	1
only	1
people	1
the	1
soul	1
by	1
continually	1
flitting	1
through	1
it.	1
In	1
this	1
enchanted	1
mood,	1
thy	1
spirit	1
ebbs	1
away	1
to	1
whence	1
it	1
came;	1
becomes	1
diffused	1
through	1
time	1
and	1
space;	1
like	1
Crammer's	1
sprinkled	1
Pantheistic	1
ashes,	1
forming	1
at	1
last	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
every	1
shore	1
the	1
round	1
globe	1
over.	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
life	1
in	1
thee,	1
now,	1
except	1
that	1
rocking	1
life	1
imparted	1
by	1
a	1
gently	1
rolling	1
ship;	1
by	1
her,	1
borrowed	1
from	1
the	1
sea;	1
by	1
the	1
sea,	1
from	1
the	1
inscrutable	1
tides	1
of	1
God.	1
But	1
while	1
this	1
sleep,	1
this	1
dream	1
is	1
on	1
ye,	1
move	1
your	1
foot	1
or	1
hand	1
an	1
inch;	1
slip	1
your	1
hold	1
at	1
all;	1
and	1
your	1
identity	1
comes	1
back	1
in	1
horror.	1
Over	1
Descartian	1
vortices	1
you	1
hover.	1
And	1
perhaps,	1
at	1
mid-day,	1
in	1
the	1
fairest	1
weather,	1
with	1
one	1
half-throttled	1
shriek	1
you	1
drop	1
through	1
that	1
transparent	1
air	1
into	1
the	1
summer	1
sea,	1
no	1
more	1
to	1
rise	1
for	1
ever.	1
Heed	1
it	1
well,	1
ye	1
Pantheists!	1
CHAPTER	1
36	1
The	1
Quarter-Deck.	1
(ENTER	1
AHAB:	1
THEN,	1
ALL)	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
great	1
while	1
after	1
the	1
affair	1
of	1
the	1
pipe,	1
that	1
one	1
morning	1
shortly	1
after	1
breakfast,	1
Ahab,	1
as	1
was	1
his	1
wont,	1
ascended	1
the	1
cabin-gangway	1
to	1
the	1
deck.	1
There	1
most	1
sea-captains	1
usually	1
walk	1
at	1
that	1
hour,	1
as	1
country	1
gentlemen,	1
after	1
the	1
same	1
meal,	1
take	1
a	1
few	1
turns	1
in	1
the	1
garden.	1
Soon	1
his	1
steady,	1
ivory	1
stride	1
was	1
heard,	1
as	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
he	1
paced	1
his	1
old	1
rounds,	1
upon	1
planks	1
so	1
familiar	1
to	1
his	1
tread,	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
over	1
dented,	1
like	1
geological	1
stones,	1
with	1
the	1
peculiar	1
mark	1
of	1
his	1
walk.	1
Did	1
you	1
fixedly	1
gaze,	1
too,	1
upon	1
that	1
ribbed	1
and	1
dented	1
brow;	1
there	1
also,	1
you	1
would	1
see	1
still	1
stranger	1
foot-prints--the	1
foot-prints	1
of	1
his	1
one	1
unsleeping,	1
ever-pacing	1
thought.	1
But	1
on	1
the	1
occasion	1
in	1
question,	1
those	1
dents	1
looked	1
deeper,	1
even	1
as	1
his	1
nervous	1
step	1
that	1
morning	1
left	1
a	1
deeper	1
mark.	1
And,	1
so	1
full	1
of	1
his	1
thought	1
was	1
Ahab,	1
that	1
at	1
every	1
uniform	1
turn	1
that	1
he	1
made,	1
now	1
at	1
the	1
main-mast	1
and	1
now	1
at	1
the	1
binnacle,	1
you	1
could	1
almost	1
see	1
that	1
thought	1
turn	1
in	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
turned,	1
and	1
pace	1
in	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
paced;	1
so	1
completely	1
possessing	1
him,	1
indeed,	1
that	1
it	1
all	1
but	1
seemed	1
the	1
inward	1
mould	1
of	1
every	1
outer	1
movement.	1
"D'ye	1
mark	1
him,	1
Flask?"	1
whispered	1
Stubb;	1
"the	1
chick	1
that's	1
in	1
him	1
pecks	1
the	1
shell.	1
'Twill	1
soon	1
be	1
out."	1
The	1
hours	1
wore	1
on;--Ahab	1
now	1
shut	1
up	1
within	1
his	1
cabin;	1
anon,	1
pacing	1
the	1
deck,	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
intense	1
bigotry	1
of	1
purpose	1
in	1
his	1
aspect.	1
It	1
drew	1
near	1
the	1
close	1
of	1
day.	1
Suddenly	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
halt	1
by	1
the	1
bulwarks,	1
and	1
inserting	1
his	1
bone	1
leg	1
into	1
the	1
auger-hole	1
there,	1
and	1
with	1
one	1
hand	1
grasping	1
a	1
shroud,	1
he	1
ordered	1
Starbuck	1
to	1
send	1
everybody	1
aft.	1
"Sir!"	1
said	1
the	1
mate,	1
astonished	1
at	1
an	1
order	1
seldom	1
or	1
never	1
given	1
on	1
ship-board	1
except	1
in	1
some	1
extraordinary	1
case.	1
"Send	1
everybody	1
aft,"	1
repeated	1
Ahab.	1
"Mast-heads,	1
there!	1
come	1
down!"	1
When	1
the	1
entire	1
ship's	1
company	1
were	1
assembled,	1
and	1
with	1
curious	1
and	1
not	1
wholly	1
unapprehensive	1
faces,	1
were	1
eyeing	1
him,	1
for	1
he	1
looked	1
not	1
unlike	1
the	1
weather	1
horizon	1
when	1
a	1
storm	1
is	1
coming	1
up,	1
Ahab,	1
after	1
rapidly	1
glancing	1
over	1
the	1
bulwarks,	1
and	1
then	1
darting	1
his	1
eyes	1
among	1
the	1
crew,	1
started	1
from	1
his	1
standpoint;	1
and	1
as	1
though	1
not	1
a	1
soul	1
were	1
nigh	1
him	1
resumed	1
his	1
heavy	1
turns	1
upon	1
the	1
deck.	1
With	1
bent	1
head	1
and	1
half-slouched	1
hat	1
he	1
continued	1
to	1
pace,	1
unmindful	1
of	1
the	1
wondering	1
whispering	1
among	1
the	1
men;	1
till	1
Stubb	1
cautiously	1
whispered	1
to	1
Flask,	1
that	1
Ahab	1
must	1
have	1
summoned	1
them	1
there	1
for	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
witnessing	1
a	1
pedestrian	1
feat.	1
But	1
this	1
did	1
not	1
last	1
long.	1
Vehemently	1
pausing,	1
he	1
cried:--	1
"What	1
do	1
ye	1
do	1
when	1
ye	1
see	1
a	1
whale,	1
men?"	1
"Sing	1
out	1
for	1
him!"	1
was	1
the	1
impulsive	1
rejoinder	1
from	1
a	1
score	1
of	1
clubbed	1
voices.	1
"Good!"	1
cried	1
Ahab,	1
with	1
a	1
wild	1
approval	1
in	1
his	1
tones;	1
observing	1
the	1
hearty	1
animation	1
into	1
which	1
his	1
unexpected	1
question	1
had	1
so	1
magnetically	1
thrown	1
them.	1
"And	1
what	1
do	1
ye	1
next,	1
men?"	1
"Lower	1
away,	1
and	1
after	1
him!"	1
"And	1
what	1
tune	1
is	1
it	1
ye	1
pull	1
to,	1
men?"	1
"A	1
dead	1
whale	1
or	1
a	1
stove	1
boat!"	1
More	1
and	1
more	1
strangely	1
and	1
fiercely	1
glad	1
and	1
approving,	1
grew	1
the	1
countenance	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
at	1
every	1
shout;	1
while	1
the	1
mariners	1
began	1
to	1
gaze	1
curiously	1
at	1
each	1
other,	1
as	1
if	1
marvelling	1
how	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
they	1
themselves	1
became	1
so	1
excited	1
at	1
such	1
seemingly	1
purposeless	1
questions.	1
But,	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
eagerness	1
again,	1
as	1
Ahab,	1
now	1
half-revolving	1
in	1
his	1
pivot-hole,	1
with	1
one	1
hand	1
reaching	1
high	1
up	1
a	1
shroud,	1
and	1
tightly,	1
almost	1
convulsively	1
grasping	1
it,	1
addressed	1
them	1
thus:--	1
"All	1
ye	1
mast-headers	1
have	1
before	1
now	1
heard	1
me	1
give	1
orders	1
about	1
a	1
white	1
whale.	1
Look	1
ye!	1
d'ye	1
see	1
this	1
Spanish	1
ounce	1
of	1
gold?"--holding	1
up	1
a	1
broad	1
bright	1
coin	1
to	1
the	1
sun--"it	1
is	1
a	1
sixteen	1
dollar	1
piece,	1
men.	1
D'ye	1
see	1
it?	1
Mr.	1
Starbuck,	1
hand	1
me	1
yon	1
top-maul."	1
While	1
the	1
mate	1
was	1
getting	1
the	1
hammer,	1
Ahab,	1
without	1
speaking,	1
was	1
slowly	1
rubbing	1
the	1
gold	1
piece	1
against	1
the	1
skirts	1
of	1
his	1
jacket,	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
heighten	1
its	1
lustre,	1
and	1
without	1
using	1
any	1
words	1
was	1
meanwhile	1
lowly	1
humming	1
to	1
himself,	1
producing	1
a	1
sound	1
so	1
strangely	1
muffled	1
and	1
inarticulate	1
that	1
it	1
seemed	1
the	1
mechanical	1
humming	1
of	1
the	1
wheels	1
of	1
his	1
vitality	1
in	1
him.	1
Receiving	1
the	1
top-maul	1
from	1
Starbuck,	1
he	1
advanced	1
towards	1
the	1
main-mast	1
with	1
the	1
hammer	1
uplifted	1
in	1
one	1
hand,	1
exhibiting	1
the	1
gold	1
with	1
the	1
other,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
high	1
raised	1
voice	1
exclaiming:	1
"Whosoever	1
of	1
ye	1
raises	1
me	1
a	1
white-headed	1
whale	1
with	1
a	1
wrinkled	1
brow	1
and	1
a	1
crooked	1
jaw;	1
whosoever	1
of	1
ye	1
raises	1
me	1
that	1
white-headed	1
whale,	1
with	1
three	1
holes	1
punctured	1
in	1
his	1
starboard	1
fluke--look	1
ye,	1
whosoever	1
of	1
ye	1
raises	1
me	1
that	1
same	1
white	1
whale,	1
he	1
shall	1
have	1
this	1
gold	1
ounce,	1
my	1
boys!"	1
"Huzza!	1
huzza!"	1
cried	1
the	1
seamen,	1
as	1
with	1
swinging	1
tarpaulins	1
they	1
hailed	1
the	1
act	1
of	1
nailing	1
the	1
gold	1
to	1
the	1
mast.	1
"It's	1
a	1
white	1
whale,	1
I	1
say,"	1
resumed	1
Ahab,	1
as	1
he	1
threw	1
down	1
the	1
topmaul:	1
"a	1
white	1
whale.	1
Skin	1
your	1
eyes	1
for	1
him,	1
men;	1
look	1
sharp	1
for	1
white	1
water;	1
if	1
ye	1
see	1
but	1
a	1
bubble,	1
sing	1
out."	1
All	1
this	1
while	1
Tashtego,	1
Daggoo,	1
and	1
Queequeg	1
had	1
looked	1
on	1
with	1
even	1
more	1
intense	1
interest	1
and	1
surprise	1
than	1
the	1
rest,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
mention	1
of	1
the	1
wrinkled	1
brow	1
and	1
crooked	1
jaw	1
they	1
had	1
started	1
as	1
if	1
each	1
was	1
separately	1
touched	1
by	1
some	1
specific	1
recollection.	1
"Captain	1
Ahab,"	1
said	1
Tashtego,	1
"that	1
white	1
whale	1
must	1
be	1
the	1
same	1
that	1
some	1
call	1
Moby	1
Dick."	1
"Moby	1
Dick?"	1
shouted	1
Ahab.	1
"Do	1
ye	1
know	1
the	1
white	1
whale	1
then,	1
Tash?"	1
"Does	1
he	1
fan-tail	1
a	1
little	1
curious,	1
sir,	1
before	1
he	1
goes	1
down?"	1
said	1
the	1
Gay-Header	1
deliberately.	1
"And	1
has	1
he	1
a	1
curious	1
spout,	1
too,"	1
said	1
Daggoo,	1
"very	1
bushy,	1
even	1
for	1
a	1
parmacetty,	1
and	1
mighty	1
quick,	1
Captain	1
Ahab?"	1
"And	1
he	1
have	1
one,	1
two,	1
three--oh!	1
good	1
many	1
iron	1
in	1
him	1
hide,	1
too,	1
Captain,"	1
cried	1
Queequeg	1
disjointedly,	1
"all	1
twiske-tee	1
be-twisk,	1
like	1
him--him--"	1
faltering	1
hard	1
for	1
a	1
word,	1
and	1
screwing	1
his	1
hand	1
round	1
and	1
round	1
as	1
though	1
uncorking	1
a	1
bottle--"like	1
him--him--"	1
"Corkscrew!"	1
cried	1
Ahab,	1
"aye,	1
Queequeg,	1
the	1
harpoons	1
lie	1
all	1
twisted	1
and	1
wrenched	1
in	1
him;	1
aye,	1
Daggoo,	1
his	1
spout	1
is	1
a	1
big	1
one,	1
like	1
a	1
whole	1
shock	1
of	1
wheat,	1
and	1
white	1
as	1
a	1
pile	1
of	1
our	1
Nantucket	1
wool	1
after	1
the	1
great	1
annual	1
sheep-shearing;	1
aye,	1
Tashtego,	1
and	1
he	1
fan-tails	1
like	1
a	1
split	1
jib	1
in	1
a	1
squall.	1
Death	1
and	1
devils!	1
men,	1
it	1
is	1
Moby	1
Dick	1
ye	1
have	1
seen--Moby	1
Dick--Moby	1
Dick!"	1
"Captain	1
Ahab,"	1
said	1
Starbuck,	1
who,	1
with	1
Stubb	1
and	1
Flask,	1
had	1
thus	1
far	1
been	1
eyeing	1
his	1
superior	1
with	1
increasing	1
surprise,	1
but	1
at	1
last	1
seemed	1
struck	1
with	1
a	1
thought	1
which	1
somewhat	1
explained	1
all	1
the	1
wonder.	1
"Captain	1
Ahab,	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
Moby	1
Dick--but	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
Moby	1
Dick	1
that	1
took	1
off	1
thy	1
leg?"	1
"Who	1
told	1
thee	1
that?"	1
cried	1
Ahab;	1
then	1
pausing,	1
"Aye,	1
Starbuck;	1
aye,	1
my	1
hearties	1
all	1
round;	1
it	1
was	1
Moby	1
Dick	1
that	1
dismasted	1
me;	1
Moby	1
Dick	1
that	1
brought	1
me	1
to	1
this	1
dead	1
stump	1
I	1
stand	1
on	1
now.	1
Aye,	1
aye,"	1
he	1
shouted	1
with	1
a	1
terrific,	1
loud,	1
animal	1
sob,	1
like	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
heart-stricken	1
moose;	1
"Aye,	1
aye!	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
accursed	1
white	1
whale	1
that	1
razeed	1
me;	1
made	1
a	1
poor	1
pegging	1
lubber	1
of	1
me	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
a	1
day!"	1
Then	1
tossing	1
both	1
arms,	1
with	1
measureless	1
imprecations	1
he	1
shouted	1
out:	1
"Aye,	1
aye!	1
and	1
I'll	1
chase	1
him	1
round	1
Good	1
Hope,	1
and	1
round	1
the	1
Horn,	1
and	1
round	1
the	1
Norway	1
Maelstrom,	1
and	1
round	1
perdition's	1
flames	1
before	1
I	1
give	1
him	1
up.	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
what	1
ye	1
have	1
shipped	1
for,	1
men!	1
to	1
chase	1
that	1
white	1
whale	1
on	1
both	1
sides	1
of	1
land,	1
and	1
over	1
all	1
sides	1
of	1
earth,	1
till	1
he	1
spouts	1
black	1
blood	1
and	1
rolls	1
fin	1
out.	1
What	1
say	1
ye,	1
men,	1
will	1
ye	1
splice	1
hands	1
on	1
it,	1
now?	1
I	1
think	1
ye	1
do	1
look	1
brave."	1
"Aye,	1
aye!"	1
shouted	1
the	1
harpooneers	1
and	1
seamen,	1
running	1
closer	1
to	1
the	1
excited	1
old	1
man:	1
"A	1
sharp	1
eye	1
for	1
the	1
white	1
whale;	1
a	1
sharp	1
lance	1
for	1
Moby	1
Dick!"	1
"God	1
bless	1
ye,"	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
half	1
sob	1
and	1
half	1
shout.	1
"God	1
bless	1
ye,	1
men.	1
Steward!	1
go	1
draw	1
the	1
great	1
measure	1
of	1
grog.	1
But	1
what's	1
this	1
long	1
face	1
about,	1
Mr.	1
Starbuck;	1
wilt	1
thou	1
not	1
chase	1
the	1
white	1
whale?	1
art	1
not	1
game	1
for	1
Moby	1
Dick?"	1
"I	1
am	1
game	1
for	1
his	1
crooked	1
jaw,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
jaws	1
of	1
Death	1
too,	1
Captain	1
Ahab,	1
if	1
it	1
fairly	1
comes	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
business	1
we	1
follow;	1
but	1
I	1
came	1
here	1
to	1
hunt	1
whales,	1
not	1
my	1
commander's	1
vengeance.	1
How	1
many	1
barrels	1
will	1
thy	1
vengeance	1
yield	1
thee	1
even	1
if	1
thou	1
gettest	1
it,	1
Captain	1
Ahab?	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
fetch	1
thee	1
much	1
in	1
our	1
Nantucket	1
market."	1
"Nantucket	1
market!	1
Hoot!	1
But	1
come	1
closer,	1
Starbuck;	1
thou	1
requirest	1
a	1
little	1
lower	1
layer.	1
If	1
money's	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
measurer,	1
man,	1
and	1
the	1
accountants	1
have	1
computed	1
their	1
great	1
counting-house	1
the	1
globe,	1
by	1
girdling	1
it	1
with	1
guineas,	1
one	1
to	1
every	1
three	1
parts	1
of	1
an	1
inch;	1
then,	1
let	1
me	1
tell	1
thee,	1
that	1
my	1
vengeance	1
will	1
fetch	1
a	1
great	1
premium	1
HERE!"	1
"He	1
smites	1
his	1
chest,"	1
whispered	1
Stubb,	1
"what's	1
that	1
for?	1
methinks	1
it	1
rings	1
most	1
vast,	1
but	1
hollow."	1
"Vengeance	1
on	1
a	1
dumb	1
brute!"	1
cried	1
Starbuck,	1
"that	1
simply	1
smote	1
thee	1
from	1
blindest	1
instinct!	1
Madness!	1
To	1
be	1
enraged	1
with	1
a	1
dumb	1
thing,	1
Captain	1
Ahab,	1
seems	1
blasphemous."	1
"Hark	1
ye	1
yet	1
again--the	1
little	1
lower	1
layer.	1
All	1
visible	1
objects,	1
man,	1
are	1
but	1
as	1
pasteboard	1
masks.	1
But	1
in	1
each	1
event--in	1
the	1
living	1
act,	1
the	1
undoubted	1
deed--there,	1
some	1
unknown	1
but	1
still	1
reasoning	1
thing	1
puts	1
forth	1
the	1
mouldings	1
of	1
its	1
features	1
from	1
behind	1
the	1
unreasoning	1
mask.	1
If	1
man	1
will	1
strike,	1
strike	1
through	1
the	1
mask!	1
How	1
can	1
the	1
prisoner	1
reach	1
outside	1
except	1
by	1
thrusting	1
through	1
the	1
wall?	1
To	1
me,	1
the	1
white	1
whale	1
is	1
that	1
wall,	1
shoved	1
near	1
to	1
me.	1
Sometimes	1
I	1
think	1
there's	1
naught	1
beyond.	1
But	1
'tis	1
enough.	1
He	1
tasks	1
me;	1
he	1
heaps	1
me;	1
I	1
see	1
in	1
him	1
outrageous	1
strength,	1
with	1
an	1
inscrutable	1
malice	1
sinewing	1
it.	1
That	1
inscrutable	1
thing	1
is	1
chiefly	1
what	1
I	1
hate;	1
and	1
be	1
the	1
white	1
whale	1
agent,	1
or	1
be	1
the	1
white	1
whale	1
principal,	1
I	1
will	1
wreak	1
that	1
hate	1
upon	1
him.	1
Talk	1
not	1
to	1
me	1
of	1
blasphemy,	1
man;	1
I'd	1
strike	1
the	1
sun	1
if	1
it	1
insulted	1
me.	1
For	1
could	1
the	1
sun	1
do	1
that,	1
then	1
could	1
I	1
do	1
the	1
other;	1
since	1
there	1
is	1
ever	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
fair	1
play	1
herein,	1
jealousy	1
presiding	1
over	1
all	1
creations.	1
But	1
not	1
my	1
master,	1
man,	1
is	1
even	1
that	1
fair	1
play.	1
Who's	1
over	1
me?	1
Truth	1
hath	1
no	1
confines.	1
Take	1
off	1
thine	1
eye!	1
more	1
intolerable	1
than	1
fiends'	1
glarings	1
is	1
a	1
doltish	1
stare!	1
So,	1
so;	1
thou	1
reddenest	1
and	1
palest;	1
my	1
heat	1
has	1
melted	1
thee	1
to	1
anger-glow.	1
But	1
look	1
ye,	1
Starbuck,	1
what	1
is	1
said	1
in	1
heat,	1
that	1
thing	1
unsays	1
itself.	1
There	1
are	1
men	1
from	1
whom	1
warm	1
words	1
are	1
small	1
indignity.	1
I	1
meant	1
not	1
to	1
incense	1
thee.	1
Let	1
it	1
go.	1
Look!	1
see	1
yonder	1
Turkish	1
cheeks	1
of	1
spotted	1
tawn--living,	1
breathing	1
pictures	1
painted	1
by	1
the	1
sun.	1
The	1
Pagan	1
leopards--the	1
unrecking	1
and	1
unworshipping	1
things,	1
that	1
live;	1
and	1
seek,	1
and	1
give	1
no	1
reasons	1
for	1
the	1
torrid	1
life	1
they	1
feel!	1
The	1
crew,	1
man,	1
the	1
crew!	1
Are	1
they	1
not	1
one	1
and	1
all	1
with	1
Ahab,	1
in	1
this	1
matter	1
of	1
the	1
whale?	1
See	1
Stubb!	1
he	1
laughs!	1
See	1
yonder	1
Chilian!	1
he	1
snorts	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
it.	1
Stand	1
up	1
amid	1
the	1
general	1
hurricane,	1
thy	1
one	1
tost	1
sapling	1
cannot,	1
Starbuck!	1
And	1
what	1
is	1
it?	1
Reckon	1
it.	1
'Tis	1
but	1
to	1
help	1
strike	1
a	1
fin;	1
no	1
wondrous	1
feat	1
for	1
Starbuck.	1
What	1
is	1
it	1
more?	1
From	1
this	1
one	1
poor	1
hunt,	1
then,	1
the	1
best	1
lance	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
Nantucket,	1
surely	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
hang	1
back,	1
when	1
every	1
foremast-hand	1
has	1
clutched	1
a	1
whetstone?	1
Ah!	1
constrainings	1
seize	1
thee;	1
I	1
see!	1
the	1
billow	1
lifts	1
thee!	1
Speak,	1
but	1
speak!--Aye,	1
aye!	1
thy	1
silence,	1
then,	1
THAT	1
voices	1
thee.	1
(ASIDE)	1
Something	1
shot	1
from	1
my	1
dilated	1
nostrils,	1
he	1
has	1
inhaled	1
it	1
in	1
his	1
lungs.	1
Starbuck	1
now	1
is	1
mine;	1
cannot	1
oppose	1
me	1
now,	1
without	1
rebellion."	1
"God	1
keep	1
me!--keep	1
us	1
all!"	1
murmured	1
Starbuck,	1
lowly.	1
But	1
in	1
his	1
joy	1
at	1
the	1
enchanted,	1
tacit	1
acquiescence	1
of	1
the	1
mate,	1
Ahab	1
did	1
not	1
hear	1
his	1
foreboding	1
invocation;	1
nor	1
yet	1
the	1
low	1
laugh	1
from	1
the	1
hold;	1
nor	1
yet	1
the	1
presaging	1
vibrations	1
of	1
the	1
winds	1
in	1
the	1
cordage;	1
nor	1
yet	1
the	1
hollow	1
flap	1
of	1
the	1
sails	1
against	1
the	1
masts,	1
as	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
their	1
hearts	1
sank	1
in.	1
For	1
again	1
Starbuck's	1
downcast	1
eyes	1
lighted	1
up	1
with	1
the	1
stubbornness	1
of	1
life;	1
the	1
subterranean	1
laugh	1
died	1
away;	1
the	1
winds	1
blew	1
on;	1
the	1
sails	1
filled	1
out;	1
the	1
ship	1
heaved	1
and	1
rolled	1
as	1
before.	1
Ah,	1
ye	1
admonitions	1
and	1
warnings!	1
why	1
stay	1
ye	1
not	1
when	1
ye	1
come?	1
But	1
rather	1
are	1
ye	1
predictions	1
than	1
warnings,	1
ye	1
shadows!	1
Yet	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
predictions	1
from	1
without,	1
as	1
verifications	1
of	1
the	1
foregoing	1
things	1
within.	1
For	1
with	1
little	1
external	1
to	1
constrain	1
us,	1
the	1
innermost	1
necessities	1
in	1
our	1
being,	1
these	1
still	1
drive	1
us	1
on.	1
"The	1
measure!	1
the	1
measure!"	1
cried	1
Ahab.	1
Receiving	1
the	1
brimming	1
pewter,	1
and	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
harpooneers,	1
he	1
ordered	1
them	1
to	1
produce	1
their	1
weapons.	1
Then	1
ranging	1
them	1
before	1
him	1
near	1
the	1
capstan,	1
with	1
their	1
harpoons	1
in	1
their	1
hands,	1
while	1
his	1
three	1
mates	1
stood	1
at	1
his	1
side	1
with	1
their	1
lances,	1
and	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
ship's	1
company	1
formed	1
a	1
circle	1
round	1
the	1
group;	1
he	1
stood	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
searchingly	1
eyeing	1
every	1
man	1
of	1
his	1
crew.	1
But	1
those	1
wild	1
eyes	1
met	1
his,	1
as	1
the	1
bloodshot	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
prairie	1
wolves	1
meet	1
the	1
eye	1
of	1
their	1
leader,	1
ere	1
he	1
rushes	1
on	1
at	1
their	1
head	1
in	1
the	1
trail	1
of	1
the	1
bison;	1
but,	1
alas!	1
only	1
to	1
fall	1
into	1
the	1
hidden	1
snare	1
of	1
the	1
Indian.	1
"Drink	1
and	1
pass!"	1
he	1
cried,	1
handing	1
the	1
heavy	1
charged	1
flagon	1
to	1
the	1
nearest	1
seaman.	1
"The	1
crew	1
alone	1
now	1
drink.	1
Round	1
with	1
it,	1
round!	1
Short	1
draughts--long	1
swallows,	1
men;	1
'tis	1
hot	1
as	1
Satan's	1
hoof.	1
So,	1
so;	1
it	1
goes	1
round	1
excellently.	1
It	1
spiralizes	1
in	1
ye;	1
forks	1
out	1
at	1
the	1
serpent-snapping	1
eye.	1
Well	1
done;	1
almost	1
drained.	1
That	1
way	1
it	1
went,	1
this	1
way	1
it	1
comes.	1
Hand	1
it	1
me--here's	1
a	1
hollow!	1
Men,	1
ye	1
seem	1
the	1
years;	1
so	1
brimming	1
life	1
is	1
gulped	1
and	1
gone.	1
Steward,	1
refill!	1
"Attend	1
now,	1
my	1
braves.	1
I	1
have	1
mustered	1
ye	1
all	1
round	1
this	1
capstan;	1
and	1
ye	1
mates,	1
flank	1
me	1
with	1
your	1
lances;	1
and	1
ye	1
harpooneers,	1
stand	1
there	1
with	1
your	1
irons;	1
and	1
ye,	1
stout	1
mariners,	1
ring	1
me	1
in,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
in	1
some	1
sort	1
revive	1
a	1
noble	1
custom	1
of	1
my	1
fisherman	1
fathers	1
before	1
me.	1
O	1
men,	1
you	1
will	1
yet	1
see	1
that--Ha!	1
boy,	1
come	1
back?	1
bad	1
pennies	1
come	1
not	1
sooner.	1
Hand	1
it	1
me.	1
Why,	1
now,	1
this	1
pewter	1
had	1
run	1
brimming	1
again,	1
were't	1
not	1
thou	1
St.	1
Vitus'	1
imp--away,	1
thou	1
ague!	1
"Advance,	1
ye	1
mates!	1
Cross	1
your	1
lances	1
full	1
before	1
me.	1
Well	1
done!	1
Let	1
me	1
touch	1
the	1
axis."	1
So	1
saying,	1
with	1
extended	1
arm,	1
he	1
grasped	1
the	1
three	1
level,	1
radiating	1
lances	1
at	1
their	1
crossed	1
centre;	1
while	1
so	1
doing,	1
suddenly	1
and	1
nervously	1
twitched	1
them;	1
meanwhile,	1
glancing	1
intently	1
from	1
Starbuck	1
to	1
Stubb;	1
from	1
Stubb	1
to	1
Flask.	1
It	1
seemed	1
as	1
though,	1
by	1
some	1
nameless,	1
interior	1
volition,	1
he	1
would	1
fain	1
have	1
shocked	1
into	1
them	1
the	1
same	1
fiery	1
emotion	1
accumulated	1
within	1
the	1
Leyden	1
jar	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
magnetic	1
life.	1
The	1
three	1
mates	1
quailed	1
before	1
his	1
strong,	1
sustained,	1
and	1
mystic	1
aspect.	1
Stubb	1
and	1
Flask	1
looked	1
sideways	1
from	1
him;	1
the	1
honest	1
eye	1
of	1
Starbuck	1
fell	1
downright.	1
"In	1
vain!"	1
cried	1
Ahab;	1
"but,	1
maybe,	1
'tis	1
well.	1
For	1
did	1
ye	1
three	1
but	1
once	1
take	1
the	1
full-forced	1
shock,	1
then	1
mine	1
own	1
electric	1
thing,	1
THAT	1
had	1
perhaps	1
expired	1
from	1
out	1
me.	1
Perchance,	1
too,	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
dropped	1
ye	1
dead.	1
Perchance	1
ye	1
need	1
it	1
not.	1
Down	1
lances!	1
And	1
now,	1
ye	1
mates,	1
I	1
do	1
appoint	1
ye	1
three	1
cupbearers	1
to	1
my	1
three	1
pagan	1
kinsmen	1
there--yon	1
three	1
most	1
honourable	1
gentlemen	1
and	1
noblemen,	1
my	1
valiant	1
harpooneers.	1
Disdain	1
the	1
task?	1
What,	1
when	1
the	1
great	1
Pope	1
washes	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
beggars,	1
using	1
his	1
tiara	1
for	1
ewer?	1
Oh,	1
my	1
sweet	1
cardinals!	1
your	1
own	1
condescension,	1
THAT	1
shall	1
bend	1
ye	1
to	1
it.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
order	1
ye;	1
ye	1
will	1
it.	1
Cut	1
your	1
seizings	1
and	1
draw	1
the	1
poles,	1
ye	1
harpooneers!"	1
Silently	1
obeying	1
the	1
order,	1
the	1
three	1
harpooneers	1
now	1
stood	1
with	1
the	1
detached	1
iron	1
part	1
of	1
their	1
harpoons,	1
some	1
three	1
feet	1
long,	1
held,	1
barbs	1
up,	1
before	1
him.	1
"Stab	1
me	1
not	1
with	1
that	1
keen	1
steel!	1
Cant	1
them;	1
cant	1
them	1
over!	1
know	1
ye	1
not	1
the	1
goblet	1
end?	1
Turn	1
up	1
the	1
socket!	1
So,	1
so;	1
now,	1
ye	1
cup-bearers,	1
advance.	1
The	1
irons!	1
take	1
them;	1
hold	1
them	1
while	1
I	1
fill!"	1
Forthwith,	1
slowly	1
going	1
from	1
one	1
officer	1
to	1
the	1
other,	1
he	1
brimmed	1
the	1
harpoon	1

"Now,	1
three	1
to	1
three,	1
ye	1
stand.	1
Commend	1
the	1
murderous	1
chalices!	1
Bestow	1
them,	1
ye	1
who	1
are	1
now	1
made	1
parties	1
to	1
this	1
indissoluble	1
league.	1
Ha!	1
Starbuck!	1
but	1
the	1
deed	1
is	1
done!	1
Yon	1
ratifying	1
sun	1
now	1
waits	1
to	1
sit	1
upon	1
it.	1
Drink,	1
ye	1
harpooneers!	1
drink	1
and	1
swear,	1
ye	1

that	1
man	1
the	1

lifted;	1
and	1
to	1
cries	1
and	1
maledictions	1
against	1
the	1
white	1
whale,	1
the	1
spirits	1
were	1
simultaneously	1
quaffed	1
down	1
with	1
a	1
hiss.	1
Starbuck	1
paled,	1

turned,	1
and	1
shivered.	1
Once	1

finally,	1
the	1
replenished	1

went	1
the	1
rounds	1
among	1
the	1

when,	1
waving	1
his	1
free	1
hand	1
to	1
them,	1
they	1
all	1
dispersed;	1

Ahab	1
retired	1

CHAPTER	1

Sunset.	1
THE	1
CABIN;	1
BY	1
THE	1
STERN	1
WINDOWS;	1
AHAB	1
SITTING	1
ALONE,	1
AND	1
GAZING	1
OUT.	1
I	1
leave	1
a	1
white	1
and	1
turbid	1
wake;	1
pale	1
waters,	1
paler	1
cheeks,	1
where'er	1
I	1
sail.	1
The	1
envious	1
billows	1
sidelong	1
swell	1
to	1
whelm	1
my	1
track;	1
let	1
them;	1
but	1
first	1
I	1
pass.	1
Yonder,	1
by	1
ever-brimming	1
goblet's	1
rim,	1
the	1
warm	1
waves	1
blush	1
like	1
wine.	1
The	1
gold	1
brow	1
plumbs	1
the	1
blue.	1
The	1
diver	1
sun--slow	1
dived	1
from	1
noon--goes	1
down;	1
my	1
soul	1
mounts	1
up!	1
she	1
wearies	1
with	1
her	1
endless	1
hill.	1
Is,	1
then,	1
the	1
crown	1
too	1
heavy	1
that	1
I	1
wear?	1
this	1
Iron	1
Crown	1
of	1
Lombardy.	1
Yet	1
is	1
it	1
bright	1
with	1
many	1
a	1
gem;	1
I	1
the	1
wearer,	1
see	1
not	1
its	1
far	1
flashings;	1
but	1
darkly	1
feel	1
that	1
I	1
wear	1
that,	1
that	1
dazzlingly	1
confounds.	1
'Tis	1
iron--that	1
I	1
know--not	1
gold.	1
'Tis	1
split,	1
too--that	1
I	1
feel;	1
the	1
jagged	1
edge	1
galls	1
me	1
so,	1
my	1
brain	1
seems	1
to	1
beat	1
against	1
the	1
solid	1
metal;	1
aye,	1
steel	1
skull,	1
mine;	1
the	1
sort	1
that	1
needs	1
no	1
helmet	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
brain-battering	1
fight!	1
Dry	1
heat	1
upon	1
my	1
brow?	1
Oh!	1
time	1
was,	1
when	1
as	1
the	1
sunrise	1
nobly	1
spurred	1
me,	1
so	1
the	1
sunset	1
soothed.	1
No	1
more.	1
This	1
lovely	1
light,	1
it	1
lights	1
not	1
me;	1
all	1
loveliness	1
is	1
anguish	1
to	1
me,	1
since	1
I	1
can	1
ne'er	1
enjoy.	1
Gifted	1
with	1
the	1
high	1
perception,	1
I	1
lack	1
the	1
low,	1
enjoying	1
power;	1
damned,	1
most	1
subtly	1
and	1
most	1
malignantly!	1
damned	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
Paradise!	1
Good	1
night--good	1
night!	1
(WAVING	1
HIS	1
HAND,	1
HE	1
MOVES	1
FROM	1
THE	1
WINDOW.)	1
'Twas	1
not	1
so	1
hard	1
a	1
task.	1
I	1
thought	1
to	1
find	1
one	1
stubborn,	1
at	1
the	1
least;	1
but	1
my	1
one	1
cogged	1
circle	1
fits	1
into	1
all	1
their	1
various	1
wheels,	1
and	1
they	1
revolve.	1
Or,	1
if	1
you	1
will,	1
like	1
so	1
many	1
ant-hills	1
of	1
powder,	1
they	1
all	1
stand	1
before	1
me;	1
and	1
I	1
their	1
match.	1
Oh,	1
hard!	1
that	1
to	1
fire	1
others,	1
the	1
match	1
itself	1
must	1
needs	1
be	1
wasting!	1
What	1
I've	1
dared,	1
I've	1
willed;	1
and	1
what	1
I've	1
willed,	1
I'll	1
do!	1
They	1
think	1
me	1
mad--Starbuck	1
does;	1
but	1
I'm	1
demoniac,	1
I	1
am	1
madness	1
maddened!	1
That	1
wild	1
madness	1
that's	1
only	1
calm	1
to	1
comprehend	1
itself!	1
The	1
prophecy	1
was	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
dismembered;	1
and--Aye!	1
I	1
lost	1
this	1
leg.	1
I	1
now	1
prophesy	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
dismember	1
my	1
dismemberer.	1
Now,	1
then,	1
be	1
the	1
prophet	1
and	1
the	1
fulfiller	1
one.	1
That's	1
more	1
than	1
ye,	1
ye	1
great	1
gods,	1
ever	1
were.	1
I	1
laugh	1
and	1
hoot	1
at	1
ye,	1
ye	1
cricket-players,	1
ye	1
pugilists,	1
ye	1
deaf	1
Burkes	1
and	1
blinded	1
Bendigoes!	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
say	1
as	1
schoolboys	1
do	1
to	1
bullies--Take	1
some	1
one	1
of	1
your	1
own	1
size;	1
don't	1
pommel	1
ME!	1
No,	1
ye've	1
knocked	1
me	1
down,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
up	1
again;	1
but	1
YE	1
have	1
run	1
and	1
hidden.	1
Come	1
forth	1
from	1
behind	1
your	1
cotton	1
bags!	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
long	1
gun	1
to	1
reach	1
ye.	1
Come,	1
Ahab's	1
compliments	1
to	1
ye;	1
come	1
and	1
see	1
if	1
ye	1
can	1
swerve	1
me.	1
Swerve	1
me?	1
ye	1
cannot	1
swerve	1
me,	1
else	1
ye	1
swerve	1
yourselves!	1
man	1
has	1
ye	1
there.	1
Swerve	1
me?	1
The	1
path	1
to	1
my	1
fixed	1
purpose	1
is	1
laid	1
with	1
iron	1
rails,	1
whereon	1
my	1
soul	1
is	1
grooved	1
to	1
run.	1
Over	1
unsounded	1
gorges,	1
through	1
the	1
rifled	1
hearts	1
of	1
mountains,	1
under	1
torrents'	1
beds,	1
unerringly	1
I	1
rush!	1
Naught's	1
an	1
obstacle,	1
naught's	1
an	1
angle	1
to	1
the	1
iron	1
way!	1
CHAPTER	1

Dusk.	1
BY	1
THE	1
MAINMAST;	1
STARBUCK	1
LEANING	1
AGAINST	1
IT.	1
My	1
soul	1
is	1
more	1
than	1
matched;	1
she's	1
overmanned;	1
and	1
by	1
a	1
madman!	1
Insufferable	1
sting,	1
that	1
sanity	1
should	1
ground	1
arms	1
on	1
such	1
a	1
field!	1
But	1
he	1
drilled	1
deep	1
down,	1
and	1
blasted	1
all	1
my	1
reason	1
out	1
of	1
me!	1
I	1
think	1
I	1
see	1
his	1
impious	1
end;	1
but	1
feel	1
that	1
I	1
must	1
help	1
him	1
to	1
it.	1
Will	1
I,	1
nill	1
I,	1
the	1
ineffable	1
thing	1
has	1
tied	1
me	1
to	1
him;	1
tows	1
me	1
with	1
a	1
cable	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
knife	1
to	1
cut.	1
Horrible	1
old	1
man!	1
Who's	1
over	1
him,	1
he	1
cries;--aye,	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
democrat	1
to	1
all	1
above;	1
look,	1
how	1
he	1
lords	1
it	1
over	1
all	1
below!	1
Oh!	1
I	1
plainly	1
see	1
my	1
miserable	1
office,--to	1
obey,	1
rebelling;	1
and	1
worse	1
yet,	1
to	1
hate	1
with	1
touch	1
of	1
pity!	1
For	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
I	1
read	1
some	1
lurid	1
woe	1
would	1
shrivel	1
me	1
up,	1
had	1
I	1
it.	1
Yet	1
is	1
there	1
hope.	1
Time	1
and	1
tide	1
flow	1
wide.	1
The	1
hated	1
whale	1
has	1
the	1
round	1
watery	1
world	1
to	1
swim	1
in,	1
as	1
the	1
small	1
gold-fish	1
has	1
its	1
glassy	1
globe.	1
His	1
heaven-insulting	1
purpose,	1
God	1
may	1
wedge	1
aside.	1
I	1
would	1
up	1
heart,	1
were	1
it	1
not	1
like	1
lead.	1
But	1
my	1
whole	1
clock's	1
run	1
down;	1
my	1
heart	1
the	1
all-controlling	1
weight,	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
key	1
to	1
lift	1
again.	1
[A	1

REVELRY	1

Oh,	1

such	1

mothers	1
in	1
them!	1
Whelped	1
somewhere	1
by	1
the	1
sharkish	1
sea.	1
The	1
white	1
whale	1
is	1
their	1
demigorgon.	1
Hark!	1
the	1
infernal	1
orgies!	1
that	1
revelry	1
is	1
forward!	1
mark	1
the	1
unfaltering	1
silence	1
aft!	1
Methinks	1
it	1
pictures	1
life.	1
Foremost	1
through	1
the	1
sparkling	1
sea	1
shoots	1
on	1
the	1
gay,	1
embattled,	1
bantering	1
bow,	1
but	1
only	1
to	1
drag	1
dark	1
Ahab	1
after	1
it,	1
where	1
he	1
broods	1
within	1
his	1
sternward	1
cabin,	1
builded	1
over	1
the	1
dead	1
water	1
of	1
the	1
wake,	1
and	1
further	1
on,	1
hunted	1
by	1
its	1
wolfish	1
gurglings.	1
The	1
long	1
howl	1
thrills	1
me	1
through!	1
Peace!	1
ye	1
revellers,	1
and	1
set	1
the	1
watch!	1
Oh,	1
life!	1
'tis	1
in	1
an	1
hour	1
like	1
this,	1
with	1
soul	1
beat	1
down	1
and	1
held	1
to	1
knowledge,--as	1
wild,	1
untutored	1
things	1
are	1
forced	1
to	1
feed--Oh,	1
life!	1
'tis	1
now	1
that	1
I	1
do	1
feel	1
the	1
latent	1
horror	1
in	1
thee!	1
but	1
'tis	1
not	1
me!	1
that	1
horror's	1
out	1
of	1
me!	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
soft	1
feeling	1
of	1
the	1
human	1
in	1
me,	1
yet	1
will	1
I	1
try	1
to	1
fight	1
ye,	1
ye	1
grim,	1
phantom	1
futures!	1
Stand	1
by	1

hold	1

me,	1
O	1
ye	1
blessed	1

Ha!	1
ha!	1
ha!	1
ha!	1
hem!	1
clear	1
my	1
throat!--I've	1
been	1
thinking	1
over	1
it	1
ever	1
since,	1
and	1
that	1
ha,	1
ha's	1
the	1

Why	1
so?	1
Because	1
a	1
laugh's	1
the	1

answer	1
to	1
all	1
that's	1

and	1

will,	1
one	1
comfort's	1
always	1
left--that	1
unfailing	1
comfort	1
is,	1
it's	1
all	1

I	1
heard	1
not	1
all	1
his	1
talk	1
with	1
Starbuck;	1
but	1
to	1
my	1
poor	1
eye	1
Starbuck	1
then	1
looked	1
something	1
as	1
I	1
the	1
other	1
evening	1
felt.	1
Be	1
sure	1
the	1
old	1
Mogul	1
has	1
fixed	1
him,	1
too.	1
I	1
twigged	1
it,	1
knew	1
it;	1
had	1
had	1
the	1
gift,	1
might	1
readily	1
have	1
prophesied	1
it--for	1
when	1
I	1
clapped	1
my	1
eye	1
upon	1
his	1
skull	1
I	1
saw	1
it.	1
Well,	1
Stubb,	1
WISE	1
Stubb--that's	1
my	1
title--well,	1
Stubb,	1
what	1
of	1
it,	1
Stubb?	1
Here's	1
a	1
carcase.	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
all	1
that	1
may	1
be	1
coming,	1
but	1
be	1
it	1
what	1
it	1
will,	1
I'll	1
go	1
to	1
it	1
laughing.	1
Such	1
a	1
waggish	1
leering	1
as	1
lurks	1
in	1

CHAPTER	1
41	1
Moby	1
Dick.	1
I,	1
Ishmael,	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
that	1
crew;	1
my	1
shouts	1
had	1
gone	1
up	1
with	1
the	1
rest;	1
my	1
oath	1
had	1
been	1
welded	1
with	1
theirs;	1
and	1
stronger	1
I	1
shouted,	1
and	1
more	1
did	1
I	1
hammer	1
and	1
clinch	1
my	1
oath,	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
dread	1
in	1
my	1
soul.	1
A	1
wild,	1
mystical,	1
sympathetical	1
feeling	1
was	1
in	1
me;	1
Ahab's	1
quenchless	1
feud	1
seemed	1
mine.	1
With	1
greedy	1
ears	1
I	1
learned	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
that	1
murderous	1
monster	1
against	1
whom	1
I	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
others	1
had	1
taken	1
our	1
oaths	1
of	1
violence	1
and	1
revenge.	1
For	1
some	1
time	1
past,	1
though	1
at	1
intervals	1
only,	1
the	1
unaccompanied,	1
secluded	1
White	1
Whale	1
had	1
haunted	1
those	1
uncivilized	1
seas	1
mostly	1
frequented	1
by	1
the	1
Sperm	1
Whale	1
fishermen.	1
But	1
not	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
knew	1
of	1
his	1
existence;	1
only	1
a	1
few	1
of	1
them,	1
comparatively,	1
had	1
knowingly	1
seen	1
him;	1
while	1
the	1
number	1
who	1
as	1
yet	1
had	1
actually	1
and	1
knowingly	1
given	1
battle	1
to	1
him,	1
was	1
small	1
indeed.	1
For,	1
owing	1
to	1
the	1
large	1
number	1
of	1
whale-cruisers;	1
the	1
disorderly	1
way	1
they	1
were	1
sprinkled	1
over	1
the	1
entire	1
watery	1
circumference,	1
many	1
of	1
them	1
adventurously	1
pushing	1
their	1
quest	1
along	1
solitary	1
latitudes,	1
so	1
as	1
seldom	1
or	1
never	1
for	1
a	1
whole	1
twelvemonth	1
or	1
more	1
on	1
a	1
stretch,	1
to	1
encounter	1
a	1
single	1
news-telling	1
sail	1
of	1
any	1
sort;	1
the	1
inordinate	1
length	1
of	1
each	1
separate	1
voyage;	1
the	1
irregularity	1
of	1
the	1
times	1
of	1
sailing	1
from	1
home;	1
all	1
these,	1
with	1
other	1
circumstances,	1
direct	1
and	1
indirect,	1
long	1
obstructed	1
the	1
spread	1
through	1
the	1
whole	1
world-wide	1
whaling-fleet	1
of	1
the	1
special	1
individualizing	1
tidings	1
concerning	1
Moby	1
Dick.	1
It	1
was	1
hardly	1
to	1
be	1
doubted,	1
that	1
several	1
vessels	1
reported	1
to	1
have	1
encountered,	1
at	1
such	1
or	1
such	1
a	1
time,	1
or	1
on	1
such	1
or	1
such	1
a	1
meridian,	1
a	1
Sperm	1
Whale	1
of	1
uncommon	1
magnitude	1
and	1
malignity,	1
which	1
whale,	1
after	1
doing	1
great	1
mischief	1
to	1
his	1
assailants,	1
had	1
completely	1
escaped	1
them;	1
to	1
some	1
minds	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
an	1
unfair	1
presumption,	1
I	1
say,	1
that	1
the	1
whale	1
in	1
question	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
no	1
other	1
than	1
Moby	1
Dick.	1
Yet	1
as	1
of	1
late	1
the	1
Sperm	1
Whale	1
fishery	1
had	1
been	1
marked	1
by	1
various	1
and	1
not	1
unfrequent	1
instances	1
of	1
great	1
ferocity,	1
cunning,	1
and	1
malice	1
in	1
the	1
monster	1
attacked;	1
therefore	1
it	1
was,	1
that	1
those	1
who	1
by	1
accident	1
ignorantly	1
gave	1
battle	1
to	1
Moby	1
Dick;	1
such	1
hunters,	1
perhaps,	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
part,	1
were	1
content	1
to	1
ascribe	1
the	1
peculiar	1
terror	1
he	1
bred,	1
more,	1
as	1
it	1
were,	1
to	1
the	1
perils	1
of	1
the	1
Sperm	1
Whale	1
fishery	1
at	1
large,	1
than	1
to	1
the	1
individual	1
cause.	1
In	1
that	1
way,	1
mostly,	1
the	1
disastrous	1
encounter	1
between	1
Ahab	1
and	1
the	1
whale	1
had	1
hitherto	1
been	1
popularly	1
regarded.	1
And	1
as	1
for	1
those	1
who,	1
previously	1
hearing	1
of	1
the	1
White	1
Whale,	1
by	1
chance	1
caught	1
sight	1
of	1
him;	1
in	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
thing	1
they	1
had	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
them,	1
almost,	1
as	1
boldly	1
and	1
fearlessly	1
lowered	1
for	1
him,	1
as	1
for	1
any	1
other	1
whale	1
of	1
that	1
species.	1
But	1
at	1
length,	1
such	1
calamities	1
did	1
ensue	1
in	1
these	1
assaults--not	1
restricted	1
to	1
sprained	1
wrists	1
and	1
ankles,	1
broken	1
limbs,	1
or	1
devouring	1
amputations--but	1
fatal	1
to	1
the	1
last	1
degree	1
of	1
fatality;	1
those	1
repeated	1
disastrous	1
repulses,	1
all	1
accumulating	1
and	1
piling	1
their	1
terrors	1
upon	1
Moby	1
Dick;	1
those	1
things	1
had	1
gone	1
far	1
to	1
shake	1
the	1
fortitude	1
of	1
many	1
brave	1
hunters,	1
to	1
whom	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
the	1
White	1
Whale	1
had	1
eventually	1
come.	1
Nor	1
did	1
wild	1
rumors	1
of	1
all	1
sorts	1
fail	1
to	1
exaggerate,	1
and	1
still	1
the	1
more	1
horrify	1
the	1
true	1
histories	1
of	1
these	1
deadly	1
encounters.	1
For	1
not	1
only	1
do	1
fabulous	1
rumors	1
naturally	1
grow	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
very	1
body	1
of	1
all	1
surprising	1
terrible	1
events,--as	1
the	1
smitten	1
tree	1
gives	1
birth	1
to	1
its	1
fungi;	1
but,	1
in	1
maritime	1
life,	1
far	1
more	1
than	1
in	1
that	1
of	1
terra	1
firma,	1
wild	1
rumors	1
abound,	1
wherever	1
there	1
is	1
any	1
adequate	1
reality	1
for	1
them	1
to	1
cling	1
to.	1
And	1
as	1
the	1
sea	1
surpasses	1
the	1
land	1
in	1
this	1
matter,	1
so	1
the	1
whale	1
fishery	1
surpasses	1
every	1
other	1
sort	1
of	1
maritime	1
life,	1
in	1
the	1
wonderfulness	1
and	1
fearfulness	1
of	1
the	1
rumors	1
which	1
sometimes	1
circulate	1
there.	1
For	1
not	1
only	1
are	1
whalemen	1
as	1
a	1
body	1
unexempt	1
from	1
that	1
ignorance	1
and	1
superstitiousness	1
hereditary	1
to	1
all	1
sailors;	1
but	1
of	1
all	1
sailors,	1
they	1
are	1
by	1
all	1
odds	1
the	1
most	1
directly	1
brought	1
into	1
contact	1
with	1
whatever	1
is	1
appallingly	1
astonishing	1
in	1
the	1
sea;	1
face	1
to	1
face	1
they	1
not	1
only	1
eye	1
its	1
greatest	1
marvels,	1
but,	1
hand	1
to	1
jaw,	1
give	1
battle	1
to	1
them.	1
Alone,	1
in	1
such	1
remotest	1
waters,	1
that	1
though	1
you	1
sailed	1
a	1
thousand	1
miles,	1
and	1
passed	1
a	1
thousand	1
shores,	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
come	1
to	1
any	1
chiseled	1
hearth-stone,	1
or	1
aught	1
hospitable	1
beneath	1
that	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
sun;	1
in	1
such	1
latitudes	1
and	1
longitudes,	1
pursuing	1
too	1
such	1
a	1
calling	1
as	1
he	1
does,	1
the	1
whaleman	1
is	1
wrapped	1
by	1
influences	1
all	1
tending	1
to	1
make	1
his	1
fancy	1
pregnant	1
with	1
many	1
a	1
mighty	1
birth.	1
No	1
wonder,	1
then,	1
that	1
ever	1
gathering	1
volume	1
from	1
the	1
mere	1
transit	1
over	1
the	1
widest	1
watery	1
spaces,	1
the	1
outblown	1
rumors	1
of	1
the	1
White	1
Whale	1
did	1
in	1
the	1
end	1
incorporate	1
with	1
themselves	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
morbid	1
hints,	1
and	1
half-formed	1
foetal	1
suggestions	1
of	1
supernatural	1
agencies,	1
which	1
eventually	1
invested	1
Moby	1
Dick	1
with	1
new	1
terrors	1
unborrowed	1
from	1
anything	1
that	1
visibly	1
appears.	1
So	1
that	1
in	1
many	1
cases	1
such	1
a	1
panic	1
did	1
he	1
finally	1
strike,	1
that	1
few	1
who	1
by	1
those	1
rumors,	1
at	1
least,	1
had	1
heard	1
of	1
the	1
White	1
Whale,	1
few	1
of	1
those	1
hunters	1
were	1
willing	1
to	1
encounter	1
the	1
perils	1
of	1
his	1
jaw.	1
But	1
there	1
were	1
still	1
other	1
and	1
more	1
vital	1
practical	1
influences	1
at	1
work.	1
Not	1
even	1
at	1
the	1
present	1
day	1
has	1
the	1
original	1
prestige	1
of	1
the	1
Sperm	1
Whale,	1
as	1
fearfully	1
distinguished	1
from	1
all	1
other	1
species	1
of	1
the	1
leviathan,	1
died	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
minds	1
of	1
the	1
whalemen	1
as	1
a	1
body.	1
There	1
are	1
those	1
this	1
day	1
among	1
them,	1
who,	1
though	1
intelligent	1
and	1
courageous	1
enough	1
in	1
offering	1
battle	1
to	1
the	1
Greenland	1
or	1
Right	1
whale,	1
would	1
perhaps--either	1
from	1
professional	1
inexperience,	1
or	1
incompetency,	1
or	1
timidity,	1
decline	1
a	1
contest	1
with	1
the	1
Sperm	1
Whale;	1
at	1
any	1
rate,	1
there	1
are	1
plenty	1
of	1
whalemen,	1
especially	1
among	1
those	1
whaling	1
nations	1
not	1
sailing	1
under	1
the	1
American	1
flag,	1
who	1
have	1
never	1
hostilely	1
encountered	1
the	1
Sperm	1
Whale,	1
but	1
whose	1
sole	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
leviathan	1
is	1
restricted	1
to	1
the	1
ignoble	1
monster	1
primitively	1
pursued	1
in	1
the	1
North;	1
seated	1
on	1
their	1
hatches,	1
these	1
men	1
will	1
hearken	1
with	1
a	1
childish	1
fireside	1
interest	1
and	1
awe,	1
to	1
the	1
wild,	1
strange	1
tales	1
of	1
Southern	1
whaling.	1
Nor	1
is	1
the	1
pre-eminent	1
tremendousness	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
Sperm	1
Whale	1
anywhere	1
more	1
feelingly	1
comprehended,	1
than	1
on	1
board	1
of	1
those	1
prows	1
which	1
stem	1
him.	1
And	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
now	1
tested	1
reality	1
of	1
his	1
might	1
had	1
in	1
former	1
legendary	1
times	1
thrown	1
its	1
shadow	1
before	1
it;	1
we	1
find	1
some	1
book	1
naturalists--Olassen	1
and	1
Povelson--declaring	1
the	1
Sperm	1
Whale	1
not	1
only	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
consternation	1
to	1
every	1
other	1
creature	1
in	1
the	1
sea,	1
but	1
also	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
incredibly	1
ferocious	1
as	1
continually	1
to	1
be	1
athirst	1
for	1
human	1
blood.	1
Nor	1
even	1
down	1
to	1
so	1
late	1
a	1
time	1
as	1
Cuvier's,	1
were	1
these	1
or	1
almost	1
similar	1
impressions	1
effaced.	1
For	1
in	1
his	1
Natural	1
History,	1
the	1
Baron	1
himself	1
affirms	1
that	1
at	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
Sperm	1
Whale,	1
all	1
fish	1
(sharks	1
included)	1
are	1
"struck	1
with	1
the	1
most	1
lively	1
terrors,"	1
and	1
"often	1
in	1
the	1
precipitancy	1
of	1
their	1
flight	1
dash	1
themselves	1
against	1
the	1
rocks	1
with	1
such	1
violence	1
as	1
to	1
cause	1
instantaneous	1
death."	1
And	1
however	1
the	1
general	1
experiences	1
in	1
the	1
fishery	1
may	1
amend	1
such	1
reports	1
as	1
these;	1
yet	1
in	1
their	1
full	1
terribleness,	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
bloodthirsty	1
item	1
of	1
Povelson,	1
the	1
superstitious	1
belief	1
in	1
them	1
is,	1
in	1
some	1
vicissitudes	1
of	1
their	1
vocation,	1
revived	1
in	1
the	1
minds	1
of	1
the	1
hunters.	1
So	1
that	1
overawed	1
by	1
the	1
rumors	1
and	1
portents	1
concerning	1
him,	1
not	1
a	1
few	1
of	1
the	1
fishermen	1
recalled,	1
in	1
reference	1
to	1
Moby	1
Dick,	1
the	1
earlier	1
days	1
of	1
the	1
Sperm	1
Whale	1
fishery,	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
oftentimes	1
hard	1
to	1
induce	1
long	1
practised	1
Right	1
whalemen	1
to	1
embark	1
in	1
the	1
perils	1
of	1
this	1
new	1
and	1
daring	1
warfare;	1
such	1
men	1
protesting	1
that	1
although	1
other	1
leviathans	1
might	1
be	1
hopefully	1
pursued,	1
yet	1
to	1
chase	1
and	1
point	1
lance	1
at	1
such	1
an	1
apparition	1
as	1
the	1
Sperm	1
Whale	1
was	1
not	1
for	1
mortal	1
man.	1
That	1
to	1
attempt	1
it,	1
would	1
be	1
inevitably	1
to	1
be	1
torn	1
into	1
a	1
quick	1
eternity.	1
On	1
this	1
head,	1
there	1
are	1
some	1
remarkable	1
documents	1
that	1
may	1
be	1
consulted.	1
Nevertheless,	1
some	1
there	1
were,	1
who	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
these	1
things	1
were	1
ready	1
to	1
give	1
chase	1
to	1
Moby	1
Dick;	1
and	1
a	1
still	1
greater	1
number	1
who,	1
chancing	1
only	1
to	1
hear	1
of	1
him	1
distantly	1
and	1
vaguely,	1
without	1
the	1
specific	1
details	1
of	1
any	1
certain	1
calamity,	1
and	1
without	1
superstitious	1
accompaniments,	1
were	1
sufficiently	1
hardy	1
not	1
to	1
flee	1
from	1
the	1
battle	1
if	1
offered.	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
wild	1
suggestions	1
referred	1
to,	1
as	1
at	1
last	1
coming	1
to	1
be	1
linked	1
with	1
the	1
White	1
Whale	1
in	1
the	1
minds	1
of	1
the	1
superstitiously	1
inclined,	1
was	1
the	1
unearthly	1
conceit	1
that	1
Moby	1
Dick	1
was	1
ubiquitous;	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
actually	1
been	1
encountered	1
in	1
opposite	1
latitudes	1
at	1
one	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
instant	1
of	1
time.	1
Nor,	1
credulous	1
as	1
such	1
minds	1
must	1
have	1
been,	1
was	1
this	1
conceit	1
altogether	1
without	1
some	1
faint	1
show	1
of	1
superstitious	1
probability.	1
For	1
as	1
the	1
secrets	1
of	1
the	1
currents	1
in	1
the	1
seas	1
have	1
never	1
yet	1
been	1
divulged,	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
most	1
erudite	1
research;	1
so	1
the	1
hidden	1
ways	1
of	1
the	1
Sperm	1
Whale	1
when	1
beneath	1
the	1
surface	1
remain,	1
in	1
great	1
part,	1
unaccountable	1
to	1
his	1
pursuers;	1
and	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time	1
have	1
originated	1
the	1
most	1
curious	1
and	1
contradictory	1
speculations	1
regarding	1
them,	1
especially	1
concerning	1
the	1
mystic	1
modes	1
whereby,	1
after	1
sounding	1
to	1
a	1
great	1
depth,	1
he	1
transports	1
himself	1
with	1
such	1
vast	1
swiftness	1
to	1
the	1
most	1
widely	1
distant	1
points.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
thing	1
well	1
known	1
to	1
both	1
American	1
and	1
English	1
whale-ships,	1
and	1
as	1
well	1
a	1
thing	1
placed	1
upon	1
authoritative	1
record	1
years	1
ago	1
by	1
Scoresby,	1
that	1
some	1
whales	1
have	1
been	1
captured	1
far	1
north	1
in	1
the	1
Pacific,	1
in	1
whose	1
bodies	1
have	1
been	1
found	1
the	1
barbs	1
of	1
harpoons	1
darted	1
in	1
the	1
Greenland	1
seas.	1
Nor	1
is	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
gainsaid,	1
that	1
in	1
some	1
of	1
these	1
instances	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
declared	1
that	1
the	1
interval	1
of	1
time	1
between	1
the	1
two	1
assaults	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
exceeded	1
very	1
many	1
days.	1
Hence,	1
by	1
inference,	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
believed	1
by	1
some	1
whalemen,	1
that	1
the	1
Nor'	1
West	1
Passage,	1
so	1
long	1
a	1
problem	1
to	1
man,	1
was	1
never	1
a	1
problem	1
to	1
the	1
whale.	1
So	1
that	1
here,	1
in	1
the	1
real	1
living	1
experience	1
of	1
living	1
men,	1
the	1
prodigies	1
related	1
in	1
old	1
times	1
of	1
the	1
inland	1
Strello	1
mountain	1
in	1
Portugal	1
(near	1
whose	1
top	1
there	1
was	1
said	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
lake	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
wrecks	1
of	1
ships	1
floated	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
surface);	1
and	1
that	1
still	1
more	1
wonderful	1
story	1
of	1
the	1
Arethusa	1
fountain	1
near	1
Syracuse	1
(whose	1
waters	1
were	1
believed	1
to	1
have	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
Holy	1
Land	1
by	1
an	1
underground	1
passage);	1
these	1
fabulous	1
narrations	1
are	1
almost	1
fully	1
equalled	1
by	1
the	1
realities	1
of	1
the	1
whalemen.	1
Forced	1
into	1
familiarity,	1
then,	1
with	1
such	1
prodigies	1
as	1
these;	1
and	1
knowing	1
that	1
after	1
repeated,	1
intrepid	1
assaults,	1
the	1
White	1
Whale	1
had	1
escaped	1
alive;	1
it	1
cannot	1
be	1
much	1
matter	1
of	1
surprise	1
that	1
some	1
whalemen	1
should	1
go	1
still	1
further	1
in	1
their	1
superstitions;	1
declaring	1
Moby	1
Dick	1
not	1
only	1
ubiquitous,	1
but	1
immortal	1
(for	1
immortality	1
is	1
but	1
ubiquity	1
in	1
time);	1
that	1
though	1
groves	1
of	1
spears	1
should	1
be	1
planted	1
in	1
his	1
flanks,	1
he	1
would	1
still	1
swim	1
away	1
unharmed;	1
or	1
if	1
indeed	1
he	1
should	1
ever	1
be	1
made	1
to	1
spout	1
thick	1
blood,	1
such	1
a	1
sight	1
would	1
be	1
but	1
a	1
ghastly	1
deception;	1
for	1
again	1
in	1
unensanguined	1
billows	1
hundreds	1
of	1
leagues	1
away,	1
his	1
unsullied	1
jet	1
would	1
once	1
more	1
be	1
seen.	1
But	1
even	1
stripped	1
of	1
these	1
supernatural	1
surmisings,	1
there	1
was	1
enough	1
in	1
the	1
earthly	1
make	1
and	1
incontestable	1
character	1
of	1
the	1
monster	1
to	1
strike	1
the	1
imagination	1
with	1
unwonted	1
power.	1
For,	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
his	1
uncommon	1
bulk	1
that	1
so	1
much	1
distinguished	1
him	1
from	1
other	1
sperm	1
whales,	1
but,	1
as	1
was	1
elsewhere	1
thrown	1
out--a	1
peculiar	1
snow-white	1
wrinkled	1
forehead,	1
and	1
a	1
high,	1
pyramidical	1
white	1
hump.	1
These	1
were	1
his	1
prominent	1
features;	1
the	1
tokens	1
whereby,	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
limitless,	1
uncharted	1
seas,	1
he	1
revealed	1
his	1
identity,	1
at	1
a	1
long	1
distance,	1
to	1
those	1
who	1
knew	1
him.	1
The	1
rest	1
of	1
his	1
body	1
was	1
so	1
streaked,	1
and	1
spotted,	1
and	1
marbled	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
shrouded	1
hue,	1
that,	1
in	1
the	1
end,	1
he	1
had	1
gained	1
his	1
distinctive	1
appellation	1
of	1
the	1
White	1
Whale;	1
a	1
name,	1
indeed,	1
literally	1
justified	1
by	1
his	1
vivid	1
aspect,	1
when	1
seen	1
gliding	1
at	1
high	1
noon	1
through	1
a	1
dark	1
blue	1
sea,	1
leaving	1
a	1
milky-way	1
wake	1
of	1
creamy	1
foam,	1
all	1
spangled	1
with	1
golden	1
gleamings.	1
Nor	1
was	1
it	1
his	1
unwonted	1
magnitude,	1
nor	1
his	1
remarkable	1
hue,	1
nor	1
yet	1
his	1
deformed	1
lower	1
jaw,	1
that	1
so	1
much	1
invested	1
the	1
whale	1
with	1
natural	1
terror,	1
as	1
that	1
unexampled,	1
intelligent	1
malignity	1
which,	1
according	1
to	1
specific	1
accounts,	1
he	1
had	1
over	1
and	1
over	1
again	1
evinced	1
in	1
his	1
assaults.	1
More	1
than	1
all,	1
his	1
treacherous	1
retreats	1
struck	1
more	1
of	1
dismay	1
than	1
perhaps	1
aught	1
else.	1
For,	1
when	1
swimming	1
before	1
his	1
exulting	1
pursuers,	1
with	1
every	1
apparent	1
symptom	1
of	1
alarm,	1
he	1
had	1
several	1
times	1
been	1
known	1
to	1
turn	1
round	1
suddenly,	1
and,	1
bearing	1
down	1
upon	1
them,	1
either	1
stave	1
their	1
boats	1
to	1
splinters,	1
or	1
drive	1
them	1
back	1
in	1
consternation	1
to	1
their	1
ship.	1
Already	1
several	1
fatalities	1
had	1
attended	1
his	1
chase.	1
But	1
though	1
similar	1
disasters,	1
however	1
little	1
bruited	1
ashore,	1
were	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
unusual	1
in	1
the	1
fishery;	1
yet,	1
in	1
most	1
instances,	1
such	1
seemed	1
the	1
White	1
Whale's	1
infernal	1
aforethought	1
of	1
ferocity,	1
that	1
every	1
dismembering	1
or	1
death	1
that	1
he	1
caused,	1
was	1
not	1
wholly	1
regarded	1
as	1
having	1
been	1
inflicted	1
by	1
an	1
unintelligent	1
agent.	1
Judge,	1
then,	1
to	1
what	1
pitches	1
of	1
inflamed,	1
distracted	1
fury	1
the	1
minds	1
of	1
his	1
more	1
desperate	1
hunters	1
were	1
impelled,	1
when	1
amid	1
the	1
chips	1
of	1
chewed	1
boats,	1
and	1
the	1
sinking	1
limbs	1
of	1
torn	1
comrades,	1
they	1
swam	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
white	1
curds	1
of	1
the	1
whale's	1
direful	1
wrath	1
into	1
the	1
serene,	1
exasperating	1
sunlight,	1
that	1
smiled	1
on,	1
as	1
if	1
at	1
a	1
birth	1
or	1
a	1
bridal.	1
His	1
three	1
boats	1
stove	1
around	1
him,	1
and	1
oars	1
and	1
men	1
both	1
whirling	1
in	1
the	1
eddies;	1
one	1
captain,	1
seizing	1
the	1
line-knife	1
from	1
his	1
broken	1
prow,	1
had	1
dashed	1
at	1
the	1
whale,	1
as	1
an	1
Arkansas	1
duellist	1
at	1
his	1
foe,	1
blindly	1
seeking	1
with	1
a	1
six	1
inch	1
blade	1
to	1
reach	1
the	1
fathom-deep	1
life	1
of	1
the	1
whale.	1
That	1
captain	1
was	1
Ahab.	1
And	1
then	1
it	1
was,	1
that	1
suddenly	1
sweeping	1
his	1
sickle-shaped	1
lower	1
jaw	1
beneath	1
him,	1
Moby	1
Dick	1
had	1
reaped	1
away	1
Ahab's	1
leg,	1
as	1
a	1
mower	1
a	1
blade	1
of	1
grass	1
in	1
the	1
field.	1
No	1
turbaned	1
Turk,	1
no	1
hired	1
Venetian	1
or	1
Malay,	1
could	1
have	1
smote	1
him	1
with	1
more	1
seeming	1
malice.	1
Small	1
reason	1
was	1
there	1
to	1
doubt,	1
then,	1
that	1
ever	1
since	1
that	1
almost	1
fatal	1
encounter,	1
Ahab	1
had	1
cherished	1
a	1
wild	1
vindictiveness	1
against	1
the	1
whale,	1
all	1
the	1
more	1
fell	1
for	1
that	1
in	1
his	1
frantic	1
morbidness	1
he	1
at	1
last	1
came	1
to	1
identify	1
with	1
him,	1
not	1
only	1
all	1
his	1
bodily	1
woes,	1
but	1
all	1
his	1
intellectual	1
and	1
spiritual	1
exasperations.	1
The	1
White	1
Whale	1
swam	1
before	1
him	1
as	1
the	1
monomaniac	1
incarnation	1
of	1
all	1
those	1
malicious	1
agencies	1
which	1
some	1
deep	1
men	1
feel	1
eating	1
in	1
them,	1
till	1
they	1
are	1
left	1
living	1
on	1
with	1
half	1
a	1
heart	1
and	1
half	1
a	1
lung.	1
That	1
intangible	1
malignity	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
from	1
the	1
beginning;	1
to	1
whose	1
dominion	1
even	1
the	1
modern	1
Christians	1
ascribe	1
one-half	1
of	1
the	1
worlds;	1
which	1
the	1
ancient	1
Ophites	1
of	1
the	1
east	1
reverenced	1
in	1
their	1
statue	1
devil;--Ahab	1
did	1
not	1
fall	1
down	1
and	1
worship	1
it	1
like	1
them;	1
but	1
deliriously	1
transferring	1
its	1
idea	1
to	1
the	1
abhorred	1
white	1
whale,	1
he	1
pitted	1
himself,	1
all	1
mutilated,	1
against	1
it.	1
All	1
that	1
most	1
maddens	1
and	1
torments;	1
all	1
that	1
stirs	1
up	1
the	1
lees	1
of	1
things;	1
all	1
truth	1
with	1
malice	1
in	1
it;	1
all	1
that	1
cracks	1
the	1
sinews	1
and	1
cakes	1
the	1
brain;	1
all	1
the	1
subtle	1
demonisms	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
thought;	1
all	1
evil,	1
to	1
crazy	1
Ahab,	1
were	1
visibly	1
personified,	1
and	1
made	1
practically	1
assailable	1
in	1
Moby	1
Dick.	1
He	1
piled	1
upon	1
the	1
whale's	1
white	1
hump	1
the	1
sum	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
general	1
rage	1
and	1
hate	1
felt	1
by	1
his	1
whole	1
race	1
from	1
Adam	1
down;	1
and	1
then,	1
as	1
if	1
his	1
chest	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
mortar,	1
he	1
burst	1
his	1
hot	1
heart's	1
shell	1
upon	1
it.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
probable	1
that	1
this	1
monomania	1
in	1
him	1
took	1
its	1
instant	1
rise	1
at	1
the	1
precise	1
time	1
of	1
his	1
bodily	1
dismemberment.	1
Then,	1
in	1
darting	1
at	1
the	1
monster,	1
knife	1
in	1
hand,	1
he	1
had	1
but	1
given	1
loose	1
to	1
a	1
sudden,	1
passionate,	1
corporal	1
animosity;	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
received	1
the	1
stroke	1
that	1
tore	1
him,	1
he	1
probably	1
but	1
felt	1
the	1
agonizing	1
bodily	1
laceration,	1
but	1
nothing	1
more.	1
Yet,	1
when	1
by	1
this	1
collision	1
forced	1
to	1
turn	1
towards	1
home,	1
and	1
for	1
long	1
months	1
of	1
days	1
and	1
weeks,	1
Ahab	1
and	1
anguish	1
lay	1
stretched	1
together	1
in	1
one	1
hammock,	1
rounding	1
in	1
mid	1
winter	1
that	1
dreary,	1
howling	1
Patagonian	1
Cape;	1
then	1
it	1
was,	1
that	1
his	1
torn	1
body	1
and	1
gashed	1
soul	1
bled	1
into	1
one	1
another;	1
and	1
so	1
interfusing,	1
made	1
him	1
mad.	1
That	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
then,	1
on	1
the	1
homeward	1
voyage,	1
after	1
the	1
encounter,	1
that	1
the	1
final	1
monomania	1
seized	1
him,	1
seems	1
all	1
but	1
certain	1
from	1
the	1
fact	1
that,	1
at	1
intervals	1
during	1
the	1
passage,	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
raving	1
lunatic;	1
and,	1
though	1
unlimbed	1
of	1
a	1
leg,	1
yet	1
such	1
vital	1
strength	1
yet	1
lurked	1
in	1
his	1
Egyptian	1
chest,	1
and	1
was	1
moreover	1
intensified	1
by	1
his	1
delirium,	1
that	1
his	1
mates	1
were	1
forced	1
to	1
lace	1
him	1
fast,	1
even	1
there,	1
as	1
he	1
sailed,	1
raving	1
in	1
his	1
hammock.	1
In	1
a	1
strait-jacket,	1
he	1
swung	1
to	1
the	1
mad	1
rockings	1
of	1
the	1
gales.	1
And,	1
when	1
running	1
into	1
more	1
sufferable	1
latitudes,	1
the	1
ship,	1
with	1
mild	1
stun'sails	1
spread,	1
floated	1
across	1
the	1
tranquil	1
tropics,	1
and,	1
to	1
all	1
appearances,	1
the	1
old	1
man's	1
delirium	1
seemed	1
left	1
behind	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
Cape	1
Horn	1
swells,	1
and	1
he	1
came	1
forth	1
from	1
his	1
dark	1
den	1
into	1
the	1
blessed	1
light	1
and	1
air;	1
even	1
then,	1
when	1
he	1
bore	1
that	1
firm,	1
collected	1
front,	1
however	1
pale,	1
and	1
issued	1
his	1
calm	1
orders	1
once	1
again;	1
and	1
his	1
mates	1
thanked	1
God	1
the	1
direful	1
madness	1
was	1
now	1
gone;	1
even	1
then,	1
Ahab,	1
in	1
his	1
hidden	1
self,	1
raved	1
on.	1
Human	1
madness	1
is	1
oftentimes	1
a	1
cunning	1
and	1
most	1
feline	1
thing.	1
When	1
you	1
think	1
it	1
fled,	1
it	1
may	1
have	1
but	1
become	1
transfigured	1
into	1
some	1
still	1
subtler	1
form.	1
Ahab's	1
full	1
lunacy	1
subsided	1
not,	1
but	1
deepeningly	1
contracted;	1
like	1
the	1
unabated	1
Hudson,	1
when	1
that	1
noble	1
Northman	1
flows	1
narrowly,	1
but	1
unfathomably	1
through	1
the	1
Highland	1
gorge.	1
But,	1
as	1
in	1
his	1
narrow-flowing	1
monomania,	1
not	1
one	1
jot	1
of	1
Ahab's	1
broad	1
madness	1
had	1
been	1
left	1
behind;	1
so	1
in	1
that	1
broad	1
madness,	1
not	1
one	1
jot	1
of	1
his	1
great	1
natural	1
intellect	1
had	1
perished.	1
That	1
before	1
living	1
agent,	1
now	1
became	1
the	1
living	1
instrument.	1
If	1
such	1
a	1
furious	1
trope	1
may	1
stand,	1
his	1
special	1
lunacy	1
stormed	1
his	1
general	1
sanity,	1
and	1
carried	1
it,	1
and	1
turned	1
all	1
its	1
concentred	1
cannon	1
upon	1
its	1
own	1
mad	1
mark;	1
so	1
that	1
far	1
from	1
having	1
lost	1
his	1
strength,	1
Ahab,	1
to	1
that	1
one	1
end,	1
did	1
now	1
possess	1
a	1
thousand	1
fold	1
more	1
potency	1
than	1
ever	1
he	1
had	1
sanely	1
brought	1
to	1
bear	1
upon	1
any	1
one	1
reasonable	1
object.	1
This	1
is	1
much;	1
yet	1
Ahab's	1
larger,	1
darker,	1
deeper	1
part	1
remains	1
unhinted.	1
But	1
vain	1
to	1
popularize	1
profundities,	1
and	1
all	1
truth	1
is	1
profound.	1
Winding	1
far	1
down	1
from	1
within	1
the	1
very	1
heart	1
of	1
this	1
spiked	1
Hotel	1
de	1
Cluny	1
where	1
we	1
here	1
stand--however	1
grand	1
and	1
wonderful,	1
now	1
quit	1
it;--and	1
take	1
your	1
way,	1
ye	1
nobler,	1
sadder	1
souls,	1
to	1
those	1
vast	1
Roman	1
halls	1
of	1
Thermes;	1
where	1
far	1
beneath	1
the	1
fantastic	1
towers	1
of	1
man's	1
upper	1
earth,	1
his	1
root	1
of	1
grandeur,	1
his	1
whole	1
awful	1
essence	1
sits	1
in	1
bearded	1
state;	1
an	1
antique	1
buried	1
beneath	1
antiquities,	1
and	1
throned	1
on	1
torsoes!	1
So	1
with	1
a	1
broken	1
throne,	1
the	1
great	1
gods	1
mock	1
that	1
captive	1
king;	1
so	1
like	1
a	1
Caryatid,	1
he	1
patient	1
sits,	1
upholding	1
on	1
his	1
frozen	1
brow	1
the	1
piled	1
entablatures	1
of	1
ages.	1
Wind	1
ye	1
down	1
there,	1
ye	1
prouder,	1
sadder	1
souls!	1
question	1
that	1
proud,	1
sad	1
king!	1
A	1
family	1
likeness!	1
aye,	1
he	1
did	1
beget	1
ye,	1
ye	1
young	1
exiled	1
royalties;	1
and	1
from	1
your	1
grim	1
sire	1
only	1
will	1
the	1
old	1
State-secret	1
come.	1
Now,	1
in	1
his	1
heart,	1
Ahab	1
had	1
some	1
glimpse	1
of	1
this,	1
namely:	1
all	1
my	1
means	1
are	1
sane,	1
my	1
motive	1
and	1
my	1
object	1
mad.	1
Yet	1
without	1
power	1
to	1
kill,	1
or	1
change,	1
or	1
shun	1
the	1
fact;	1
he	1
likewise	1
knew	1
that	1
to	1
mankind	1
he	1
did	1
long	1
dissemble;	1
in	1
some	1
sort,	1
did	1
still.	1
But	1
that	1
thing	1
of	1
his	1
dissembling	1
was	1
only	1
subject	1
to	1
his	1
perceptibility,	1
not	1
to	1
his	1
will	1
determinate.	1
Nevertheless,	1
so	1
well	1
did	1
he	1
succeed	1
in	1
that	1
dissembling,	1
that	1
when	1
with	1
ivory	1
leg	1
he	1
stepped	1
ashore	1
at	1
last,	1
no	1
Nantucketer	1
thought	1
him	1
otherwise	1
than	1
but	1
naturally	1
grieved,	1
and	1
that	1
to	1
the	1
quick,	1
with	1
the	1
terrible	1
casualty	1
which	1
had	1
overtaken	1
him.	1
The	1
report	1
of	1
his	1
undeniable	1
delirium	1
at	1
sea	1
was	1
likewise	1
popularly	1
ascribed	1
to	1
a	1
kindred	1
cause.	1
And	1
so	1
too,	1
all	1
the	1
added	1
moodiness	1
which	1
always	1
afterwards,	1
to	1
the	1
very	1
day	1
of	1
sailing	1
in	1
the	1
Pequod	1
on	1
the	1
present	1
voyage,	1
sat	1
brooding	1
on	1
his	1
brow.	1
Nor	1
is	1
it	1
so	1
very	1
unlikely,	1
that	1
far	1
from	1
distrusting	1
his	1
fitness	1
for	1
another	1
whaling	1
voyage,	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
such	1
dark	1
symptoms,	1
the	1
calculating	1
people	1
of	1
that	1
prudent	1
isle	1
were	1
inclined	1
to	1
harbor	1
the	1
conceit,	1
that	1
for	1
those	1
very	1
reasons	1
he	1
was	1
all	1
the	1
better	1
qualified	1
and	1
set	1
on	1
edge,	1
for	1
a	1
pursuit	1
so	1
full	1
of	1
rage	1
and	1
wildness	1
as	1
the	1
bloody	1
hunt	1
of	1
whales.	1
Gnawed	1
within	1
and	1
scorched	1
without,	1
with	1
the	1
infixed,	1
unrelenting	1
fangs	1
of	1
some	1
incurable	1
idea;	1
such	1
an	1
one,	1
could	1
he	1
be	1
found,	1
would	1
seem	1
the	1
very	1
man	1
to	1
dart	1
his	1
iron	1
and	1
lift	1
his	1
lance	1
against	1
the	1
most	1
appalling	1
of	1
all	1
brutes.	1
Or,	1
if	1
for	1
any	1
reason	1
thought	1
to	1
be	1
corporeally	1
incapacitated	1
for	1
that,	1
yet	1
such	1
an	1
one	1
would	1
seem	1
superlatively	1
competent	1
to	1
cheer	1
and	1
howl	1
on	1
his	1
underlings	1
to	1
the	1
attack.	1
But	1
be	1
all	1
this	1
as	1
it	1
may,	1
certain	1
it	1
is,	1
that	1
with	1
the	1
mad	1
secret	1
of	1
his	1
unabated	1
rage	1
bolted	1
up	1
and	1
keyed	1
in	1
him,	1
Ahab	1
had	1
purposely	1
sailed	1
upon	1
the	1
present	1
voyage	1
with	1
the	1
one	1
only	1
and	1
all-engrossing	1
object	1
of	1
hunting	1
the	1
White	1
Whale.	1
Had	1
any	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
old	1
acquaintances	1
on	1
shore	1
but	1
half	1
dreamed	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
lurking	1
in	1
him	1
then,	1
how	1
soon	1
would	1
their	1
aghast	1
and	1
righteous	1
souls	1
have	1
wrenched	1
the	1
ship	1
from	1
such	1
a	1
fiendish	1
man!	1
They	1
were	1
bent	1
on	1
profitable	1
cruises,	1
the	1
profit	1
to	1
be	1
counted	1
down	1
in	1
dollars	1
from	1
the	1
mint.	1
He	1
was	1
intent	1
on	1
an	1
audacious,	1
immitigable,	1
and	1
supernatural	1
revenge.	1
Here,	1
then,	1
was	1
this	1
grey-headed,	1
ungodly	1
old	1
man,	1
chasing	1
with	1
curses	1
a	1
Job's	1
whale	1
round	1
the	1
world,	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
a	1
crew,	1
too,	1
chiefly	1
made	1
up	1
of	1
mongrel	1
renegades,	1
and	1
castaways,	1
and	1
cannibals--morally	1
enfeebled	1
also,	1
by	1
the	1
incompetence	1
of	1
mere	1
unaided	1
virtue	1
or	1
right-mindedness	1
in	1
Starbuck,	1
the	1
invunerable	1
jollity	1
of	1
indifference	1
and	1
recklessness	1
in	1
Stubb,	1
and	1
the	1
pervading	1
mediocrity	1
in	1
Flask.	1
Such	1
a	1
crew,	1
so	1
officered,	1
seemed	1
specially	1
picked	1
and	1
packed	1
by	1
some	1
infernal	1
fatality	1
to	1
help	1
him	1
to	1
his	1
monomaniac	1
revenge.	1
How	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
they	1
so	1
aboundingly	1
responded	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
man's	1
ire--by	1
what	1
evil	1
magic	1
their	1
souls	1
were	1
possessed,	1
that	1
at	1
times	1
his	1
hate	1
seemed	1
almost	1
theirs;	1
the	1
White	1
Whale	1
as	1
much	1
their	1
insufferable	1
foe	1
as	1
his;	1
how	1
all	1
this	1
came	1
to	1
be--what	1
the	1
White	1
Whale	1
was	1
to	1
them,	1
or	1
how	1
to	1
their	1
unconscious	1
understandings,	1
also,	1
in	1
some	1
dim,	1
unsuspected	1
way,	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
seemed	1
the	1
gliding	1
great	1
demon	1
of	1
the	1
seas	1
of	1
life,--all	1
this	1
to	1
explain,	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
dive	1
deeper	1
than	1
Ishmael	1
can	1
go.	1
The	1
subterranean	1
miner	1
that	1
works	1
in	1
us	1
all,	1
how	1
can	1
one	1
tell	1
whither	1
leads	1
his	1
shaft	1
by	1
the	1
ever	1
shifting,	1
muffled	1
sound	1
of	1
his	1
pick?	1
Who	1
does	1
not	1
feel	1
the	1
irresistible	1
arm	1
drag?	1
What	1
skiff	1
in	1
tow	1
of	1
a	1
seventy-four	1
can	1
stand	1
still?	1
For	1
one,	1
I	1
gave	1
myself	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
abandonment	1
of	1
the	1
time	1
and	1
the	1
place;	1
but	1
while	1
yet	1
all	1
a-rush	1
to	1
encounter	1
the	1
whale,	1
could	1
see	1
naught	1
in	1
that	1
brute	1
but	1
the	1
deadliest	1
ill.	1
CHAPTER	1
42	1
The	1
Whiteness	1
of	1
The	1
Whale.	1
What	1
the	1
white	1
whale	1
was	1
to	1
Ahab,	1
has	1
been	1
hinted;	1
what,	1
at	1
times,	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
me,	1
as	1
yet	1
remains	1
unsaid.	1
Aside	1
from	1
those	1
more	1
obvious	1
considerations	1
touching	1
Moby	1
Dick,	1
which	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
occasionally	1
awaken	1
in	1
any	1
man's	1
soul	1
some	1
alarm,	1
there	1
was	1
another	1
thought,	1
or	1
rather	1
vague,	1
nameless	1
horror	1
concerning	1
him,	1
which	1
at	1
times	1
by	1
its	1
intensity	1
completely	1
overpowered	1
all	1
the	1
rest;	1
and	1
yet	1
so	1
mystical	1
and	1
well	1
nigh	1
ineffable	1
was	1
it,	1
that	1
I	1
almost	1
despair	1
of	1
putting	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
comprehensible	1
form.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
whiteness	1
of	1
the	1
whale	1
that	1
above	1
all	1
things	1
appalled	1
me.	1
But	1
how	1
can	1
I	1
hope	1
to	1
explain	1
myself	1
here;	1
and	1
yet,	1
in	1
some	1
dim,	1
random	1
way,	1
explain	1
myself	1
I	1
must,	1
else	1
all	1
these	1
chapters	1
might	1
be	1
naught.	1
Though	1
in	1
many	1
natural	1
objects,	1
whiteness	1
refiningly	1
enhances	1
beauty,	1
as	1
if	1
imparting	1
some	1
special	1
virtue	1
of	1
its	1
own,	1
as	1
in	1
marbles,	1
japonicas,	1
and	1
pearls;	1
and	1
though	1
various	1
nations	1
have	1
in	1
some	1
way	1
recognised	1
a	1
certain	1
royal	1
preeminence	1
in	1
this	1
hue;	1
even	1
the	1
barbaric,	1
grand	1
old	1
kings	1
of	1
Pegu	1
placing	1
the	1
title	1
"Lord	1
of	1
the	1
White	1
Elephants"	1
above	1
all	1
their	1
other	1
magniloquent	1
ascriptions	1
of	1
dominion;	1
and	1
the	1
modern	1
kings	1
of	1
Siam	1
unfurling	1
the	1
same	1
snow-white	1
quadruped	1
in	1
the	1
royal	1
standard;	1
and	1
the	1
Hanoverian	1
flag	1
bearing	1
the	1
one	1
figure	1
of	1
a	1
snow-white	1
charger;	1
and	1
the	1
great	1
Austrian	1
Empire,	1
Caesarian,	1
heir	1
to	1
overlording	1
Rome,	1
having	1
for	1
the	1
imperial	1
colour	1
the	1
same	1
imperial	1
hue;	1
and	1
though	1
this	1
pre-eminence	1
in	1
it	1
applies	1
to	1
the	1
human	1
race	1
itself,	1
giving	1
the	1
white	1
man	1
ideal	1
mastership	1
over	1
every	1
dusky	1
tribe;	1
and	1
though,	1
besides,	1
all	1
this,	1
whiteness	1
has	1
been	1
even	1
made	1
significant	1
of	1
gladness,	1
for	1
among	1
the	1
Romans	1
a	1
white	1
stone	1
marked	1
a	1
joyful	1
day;	1
and	1
though	1
in	1
other	1
mortal	1
sympathies	1
and	1
symbolizings,	1
this	1
same	1
hue	1
is	1
made	1
the	1
emblem	1
of	1
many	1
touching,	1
noble	1
things--the	1
innocence	1
of	1
brides,	1
the	1
benignity	1
of	1
age;	1
though	1
among	1
the	1
Red	1
Men	1
of	1
America	1
the	1
giving	1
of	1
the	1
white	1
belt	1
of	1
wampum	1
was	1
the	1
deepest	1
pledge	1
of	1
honour;	1
though	1
in	1
many	1
climes,	1
whiteness	1
typifies	1
the	1
majesty	1
of	1
Justice	1
in	1
the	1
ermine	1
of	1
the	1
Judge,	1
and	1
contributes	1
to	1
the	1
daily	1
state	1
of	1
kings	1
and	1
queens	1
drawn	1
by	1
milk-white	1
steeds;	1
though	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
higher	1
mysteries	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
august	1
religions	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
made	1
the	1
symbol	1
of	1
the	1
divine	1
spotlessness	1
and	1
power;	1
by	1
the	1
Persian	1
fire	1
worshippers,	1
the	1
white	1
forked	1
flame	1
being	1
held	1
the	1
holiest	1
on	1
the	1
altar;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
Greek	1
mythologies,	1
Great	1
Jove	1
himself	1
being	1
made	1
incarnate	1
in	1
a	1
snow-white	1
bull;	1
and	1
though	1
to	1
the	1
noble	1
Iroquois,	1
the	1
midwinter	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
the	1
sacred	1
White	1
Dog	1
was	1
by	1
far	1
the	1
holiest	1
festival	1
of	1
their	1
theology,	1
that	1
spotless,	1
faithful	1
creature	1
being	1
held	1
the	1
purest	1
envoy	1
they	1
could	1
send	1
to	1
the	1
Great	1
Spirit	1
with	1
the	1
annual	1
tidings	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
fidelity;	1
and	1
though	1
directly	1
from	1
the	1
Latin	1
word	1
for	1
white,	1
all	1
Christian	1
priests	1
derive	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
one	1
part	1
of	1
their	1
sacred	1
vesture,	1
the	1
alb	1
or	1
tunic,	1
worn	1
beneath	1
the	1
cassock;	1
and	1
though	1
among	1
the	1
holy	1
pomps	1
of	1
the	1
Romish	1
faith,	1
white	1
is	1
specially	1
employed	1
in	1
the	1
celebration	1
of	1
the	1
Passion	1
of	1
our	1
Lord;	1
though	1
in	1
the	1
Vision	1
of	1
St.	1
John,	1
white	1
robes	1
are	1
given	1
to	1
the	1
redeemed,	1
and	1
the	1
four-and-twenty	1
elders	1
stand	1
clothed	1
in	1
white	1
before	1
the	1
great-white	1
throne,	1
and	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
that	1
sitteth	1
there	1
white	1
like	1
wool;	1
yet	1
for	1
all	1
these	1
accumulated	1
associations,	1
with	1
whatever	1
is	1
sweet,	1
and	1
honourable,	1
and	1
sublime,	1
there	1
yet	1
lurks	1
an	1
elusive	1
something	1
in	1
the	1
innermost	1
idea	1
of	1
this	1
hue,	1
which	1
strikes	1
more	1
of	1
panic	1
to	1
the	1
soul	1
than	1
that	1
redness	1
which	1
affrights	1
in	1
blood.	1
This	1
elusive	1
quality	1
it	1
is,	1
which	1
causes	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
whiteness,	1
when	1
divorced	1
from	1
more	1
kindly	1
associations,	1
and	1
coupled	1
with	1
any	1
object	1
terrible	1
in	1
itself,	1
to	1
heighten	1
that	1
terror	1
to	1
the	1
furthest	1
bounds.	1
Witness	1
the	1
white	1
bear	1
of	1
the	1
poles,	1
and	1
the	1
white	1
shark	1
of	1
the	1
tropics;	1
what	1
but	1
their	1
smooth,	1
flaky	1
whiteness	1
makes	1
them	1
the	1
transcendent	1
horrors	1
they	1
are?	1
That	1
ghastly	1
whiteness	1
it	1
is	1
which	1
imparts	1
such	1
an	1
abhorrent	1
mildness,	1
even	1
more	1
loathsome	1
than	1
terrific,	1
to	1
the	1
dumb	1
gloating	1
of	1
their	1
aspect.	1
So	1
that	1
not	1
the	1
fierce-fanged	1
tiger	1
in	1
his	1
heraldic	1
coat	1
can	1
so	1
stagger	1
courage	1
as	1
the	1
white-shrouded	1
bear	1
or	1
shark.*	1
*With	1
reference	1
to	1
the	1
Polar	1
bear,	1
it	1
may	1
possibly	1
be	1
urged	1
by	1
him	1
who	1
would	1
fain	1
go	1
still	1
deeper	1
into	1
this	1
matter,	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
whiteness,	1
separately	1
regarded,	1
which	1
heightens	1
the	1
intolerable	1
hideousness	1
of	1
that	1
brute;	1
for,	1
analysed,	1
that	1
heightened	1
hideousness,	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
said,	1
only	1
rises	1
from	1
the	1
circumstance,	1
that	1
the	1
irresponsible	1
ferociousness	1
of	1
the	1
creature	1
stands	1
invested	1
in	1
the	1
fleece	1
of	1
celestial	1
innocence	1
and	1
love;	1
and	1
hence,	1
by	1
bringing	1
together	1
two	1
such	1
opposite	1
emotions	1
in	1
our	1
minds,	1
the	1
Polar	1
bear	1
frightens	1
us	1
with	1
so	1
unnatural	1
a	1
contrast.	1
But	1
even	1
assuming	1
all	1
this	1
to	1
be	1
true;	1
yet,	1
were	1
it	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
whiteness,	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
that	1
intensified	1
terror.	1
As	1
for	1
the	1
white	1
shark,	1
the	1
white	1
gliding	1
ghostliness	1
of	1
repose	1
in	1
that	1
creature,	1
when	1
beheld	1
in	1
his	1
ordinary	1
moods,	1
strangely	1
tallies	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
quality	1
in	1
the	1
Polar	1
quadruped.	1
This	1
peculiarity	1
is	1
most	1
vividly	1
hit	1
by	1
the	1
French	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
they	1
bestow	1
upon	1
that	1
fish.	1
The	1
Romish	1
mass	1
for	1
the	1
dead	1
begins	1
with	1
"Requiem	1
eternam"	1
(eternal	1
rest),	1
whence	1
REQUIEM	1
denominating	1
the	1
mass	1
itself,	1
and	1
any	1
other	1
funeral	1
music.	1
Now,	1
in	1
allusion	1
to	1
the	1
white,	1
silent	1
stillness	1
of	1
death	1
in	1
this	1
shark,	1
and	1
the	1
mild	1
deadliness	1
of	1
his	1
habits,	1
the	1
French	1
call	1
him	1
REQUIN.	1
Bethink	1
thee	1
of	1
the	1
albatross,	1
whence	1
come	1
those	1
clouds	1
of	1
spiritual	1
wonderment	1
and	1
pale	1
dread,	1
in	1
which	1
that	1
white	1
phantom	1
sails	1
in	1
all	1
imaginations?	1
Not	1
Coleridge	1
first	1
threw	1
that	1
spell;	1
but	1
God's	1
great,	1
unflattering	1
laureate,	1
Nature.*	1
*I	1
remember	1
the	1
first	1
albatross	1
I	1
ever	1
saw.	1
It	1
was	1
during	1
a	1
prolonged	1
gale,	1
in	1
waters	1
hard	1
upon	1
the	1
Antarctic	1
seas.	1
From	1
my	1
forenoon	1
watch	1
below,	1
I	1
ascended	1
to	1
the	1
overclouded	1
deck;	1
and	1
there,	1
dashed	1
upon	1
the	1
main	1
hatches,	1
I	1
saw	1
a	1
regal,	1
feathery	1
thing	1
of	1
unspotted	1
whiteness,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
hooked,	1
Roman	1
bill	1
sublime.	1
At	1
intervals,	1
it	1
arched	1
forth	1
its	1
vast	1
archangel	1
wings,	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
embrace	1
some	1
holy	1
ark.	1
Wondrous	1
flutterings	1
and	1
throbbings	1
shook	1
it.	1
Though	1
bodily	1
unharmed,	1
it	1
uttered	1
cries,	1
as	1
some	1
king's	1
ghost	1
in	1
supernatural	1
distress.	1
Through	1
its	1
inexpressible,	1
strange	1
eyes,	1
methought	1
I	1
peeped	1
to	1
secrets	1
which	1
took	1
hold	1
of	1
God.	1
As	1
Abraham	1
before	1
the	1
angels,	1
I	1
bowed	1
myself;	1
the	1
white	1
thing	1
was	1
so	1
white,	1
its	1
wings	1
so	1
wide,	1
and	1
in	1
those	1
for	1
ever	1
exiled	1
waters,	1
I	1
had	1
lost	1
the	1
miserable	1
warping	1
memories	1
of	1
traditions	1
and	1
of	1
towns.	1
Long	1
I	1
gazed	1
at	1
that	1
prodigy	1
of	1
plumage.	1
I	1
cannot	1
tell,	1
can	1
only	1
hint,	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
darted	1
through	1
me	1
then.	1
But	1
at	1
last	1
I	1
awoke;	1
and	1
turning,	1
asked	1
a	1
sailor	1
what	1
bird	1
was	1
this.	1
A	1
goney,	1
he	1
replied.	1
Goney!	1
never	1
had	1
heard	1
that	1
name	1
before;	1
is	1
it	1
conceivable	1
that	1
this	1
glorious	1
thing	1
is	1
utterly	1
unknown	1
to	1
men	1
ashore!	1
never!	1
But	1
some	1
time	1
after,	1
I	1
learned	1
that	1
goney	1
was	1
some	1
seaman's	1
name	1
for	1
albatross.	1
So	1
that	1
by	1
no	1
possibility	1
could	1
Coleridge's	1
wild	1
Rhyme	1
have	1
had	1
aught	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
those	1
mystical	1
impressions	1
which	1
were	1
mine,	1
when	1
I	1
saw	1
that	1
bird	1
upon	1
our	1
deck.	1
For	1
neither	1
had	1
I	1
then	1
read	1
the	1
Rhyme,	1
nor	1
knew	1
the	1
bird	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
albatross.	1
Yet,	1
in	1
saying	1
this,	1
I	1
do	1
but	1
indirectly	1
burnish	1
a	1
little	1
brighter	1
the	1
noble	1
merit	1
of	1
the	1
poem	1
and	1
the	1
poet.	1
I	1
assert,	1
then,	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
wondrous	1
bodily	1
whiteness	1
of	1
the	1
bird	1
chiefly	1
lurks	1
the	1
secret	1
of	1
the	1
spell;	1
a	1
truth	1
the	1
more	1
evinced	1
in	1
this,	1
that	1
by	1
a	1
solecism	1
of	1
terms	1
there	1
are	1
birds	1
called	1
grey	1
albatrosses;	1
and	1
these	1
I	1
have	1
frequently	1
seen,	1
but	1
never	1
with	1
such	1
emotions	1
as	1
when	1
I	1
beheld	1
the	1
Antarctic	1
fowl.	1
But	1
how	1
had	1
the	1
mystic	1
thing	1
been	1
caught?	1
Whisper	1
it	1
not,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
tell;	1
with	1
a	1
treacherous	1
hook	1
and	1
line,	1
as	1
the	1
fowl	1
floated	1
on	1
the	1
sea.	1
At	1
last	1
the	1
Captain	1
made	1
a	1
postman	1
of	1
it;	1
tying	1
a	1
lettered,	1
leathern	1
tally	1
round	1
its	1
neck,	1
with	1
the	1
ship's	1
time	1
and	1
place;	1
and	1
then	1
letting	1
it	1
escape.	1
But	1
I	1
doubt	1
not,	1
that	1
leathern	1
tally,	1
meant	1
for	1
man,	1
was	1
taken	1
off	1
in	1
Heaven,	1
when	1
the	1
white	1
fowl	1
flew	1
to	1
join	1
the	1
wing-folding,	1
the	1
invoking,	1
and	1
adoring	1
cherubim!	1
Most	1
famous	1
in	1
our	1
Western	1
annals	1
and	1
Indian	1
traditions	1
is	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
White	1
Steed	1
of	1
the	1
Prairies;	1
a	1
magnificent	1
milk-white	1
charger,	1
large-eyed,	1
small-headed,	1
bluff-chested,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
dignity	1
of	1
a	1
thousand	1
monarchs	1
in	1
his	1
lofty,	1
overscorning	1
carriage.	1
He	1
was	1
the	1
elected	1
Xerxes	1
of	1
vast	1
herds	1
of	1
wild	1
horses,	1
whose	1
pastures	1
in	1
those	1
days	1
were	1
only	1
fenced	1
by	1
the	1
Rocky	1
Mountains	1
and	1
the	1
Alleghanies.	1
At	1
their	1
flaming	1
head	1
he	1
westward	1
trooped	1
it	1
like	1
that	1
chosen	1
star	1
which	1
every	1
evening	1
leads	1
on	1
the	1
hosts	1
of	1
light.	1
The	1
flashing	1
cascade	1
of	1
his	1
mane,	1
the	1
curving	1
comet	1
of	1
his	1
tail,	1
invested	1
him	1
with	1
housings	1
more	1
resplendent	1
than	1
gold	1
and	1
silver-beaters	1
could	1
have	1
furnished	1
him.	1
A	1
most	1
imperial	1
and	1
archangelical	1
apparition	1
of	1
that	1
unfallen,	1
western	1
world,	1
which	1
to	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
trappers	1
and	1
hunters	1
revived	1
the	1
glories	1
of	1
those	1
primeval	1
times	1
when	1
Adam	1
walked	1
majestic	1
as	1
a	1
god,	1
bluff-browed	1
and	1
fearless	1
as	1
this	1
mighty	1
steed.	1
Whether	1
marching	1
amid	1
his	1
aides	1
and	1
marshals	1
in	1
the	1
van	1
of	1
countless	1
cohorts	1
that	1
endlessly	1
streamed	1
it	1
over	1
the	1
plains,	1
like	1
an	1
Ohio;	1
or	1
whether	1
with	1
his	1
circumambient	1
subjects	1
browsing	1
all	1
around	1
at	1
the	1
horizon,	1
the	1
White	1
Steed	1
gallopingly	1
reviewed	1
them	1
with	1
warm	1
nostrils	1
reddening	1
through	1
his	1
cool	1
milkiness;	1
in	1
whatever	1
aspect	1
he	1
presented	1
himself,	1
always	1
to	1
the	1
bravest	1
Indians	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
trembling	1
reverence	1
and	1
awe.	1
Nor	1
can	1
it	1
be	1
questioned	1
from	1
what	1
stands	1
on	1
legendary	1
record	1
of	1
this	1
noble	1
horse,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
his	1
spiritual	1
whiteness	1
chiefly,	1
which	1
so	1
clothed	1
him	1
with	1
divineness;	1
and	1
that	1
this	1
divineness	1
had	1
that	1
in	1
it	1
which,	1
though	1
commanding	1
worship,	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
enforced	1
a	1
certain	1
nameless	1
terror.	1
But	1
there	1
are	1
other	1
instances	1
where	1
this	1
whiteness	1
loses	1
all	1
that	1
accessory	1
and	1
strange	1
glory	1
which	1
invests	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
White	1
Steed	1
and	1
Albatross.	1
What	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
Albino	1
man	1
so	1
peculiarly	1
repels	1
and	1
often	1
shocks	1
the	1
eye,	1
as	1
that	1
sometimes	1
he	1
is	1
loathed	1
by	1
his	1
own	1
kith	1
and	1
kin!	1
It	1
is	1
that	1
whiteness	1
which	1
invests	1
him,	1
a	1
thing	1
expressed	1
by	1
the	1
name	1
he	1
bears.	1
The	1
Albino	1
is	1
as	1
well	1
made	1
as	1
other	1
men--has	1
no	1
substantive	1
deformity--and	1
yet	1
this	1
mere	1
aspect	1
of	1
all-pervading	1
whiteness	1
makes	1
him	1
more	1
strangely	1
hideous	1
than	1
the	1
ugliest	1
abortion.	1
Why	1
should	1
this	1
be	1
so?	1
Nor,	1
in	1
quite	1
other	1
aspects,	1
does	1
Nature	1
in	1
her	1
least	1
palpable	1
but	1
not	1
the	1
less	1
malicious	1
agencies,	1
fail	1
to	1
enlist	1
among	1
her	1
forces	1
this	1
crowning	1
attribute	1
of	1
the	1
terrible.	1
From	1
its	1
snowy	1
aspect,	1
the	1
gauntleted	1
ghost	1
of	1
the	1
Southern	1
Seas	1
has	1
been	1
denominated	1
the	1
White	1
Squall.	1
Nor,	1
in	1
some	1
historic	1
instances,	1
has	1
the	1
art	1
of	1
human	1
malice	1
omitted	1
so	1
potent	1
an	1
auxiliary.	1
How	1
wildly	1
it	1
heightens	1
the	1
effect	1
of	1
that	1
passage	1
in	1
Froissart,	1
when,	1
masked	1
in	1
the	1
snowy	1
symbol	1
of	1
their	1
faction,	1
the	1
desperate	1
White	1
Hoods	1
of	1
Ghent	1
murder	1
their	1
bailiff	1
in	1
the	1
market-place!	1
Nor,	1
in	1
some	1
things,	1
does	1
the	1
common,	1
hereditary	1
experience	1
of	1
all	1
mankind	1
fail	1
to	1
bear	1
witness	1
to	1
the	1
supernaturalism	1
of	1
this	1
hue.	1
It	1
cannot	1
well	1
be	1
doubted,	1
that	1
the	1
one	1
visible	1
quality	1
in	1
the	1
aspect	1
of	1
the	1
dead	1
which	1
most	1
appals	1
the	1
gazer,	1
is	1
the	1
marble	1
pallor	1
lingering	1
there;	1
as	1
if	1
indeed	1
that	1
pallor	1
were	1
as	1
much	1
like	1
the	1
badge	1
of	1
consternation	1
in	1
the	1
other	1
world,	1
as	1
of	1
mortal	1
trepidation	1
here.	1
And	1
from	1
that	1
pallor	1
of	1
the	1
dead,	1
we	1
borrow	1
the	1
expressive	1
hue	1
of	1
the	1
shroud	1
in	1
which	1
we	1
wrap	1
them.	1
Nor	1
even	1
in	1
our	1
superstitions	1
do	1
we	1
fail	1
to	1
throw	1
the	1
same	1
snowy	1
mantle	1
round	1
our	1
phantoms;	1
all	1
ghosts	1
rising	1
in	1
a	1
milk-white	1
fog--Yea,	1
while	1
these	1
terrors	1
seize	1
us,	1
let	1
us	1
add,	1
that	1
even	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
terrors,	1
when	1
personified	1
by	1
the	1
evangelist,	1
rides	1
on	1
his	1
pallid	1
horse.	1
Therefore,	1
in	1
his	1
other	1
moods,	1
symbolize	1
whatever	1
grand	1
or	1
gracious	1
thing	1
he	1
will	1
by	1
whiteness,	1
no	1
man	1
can	1
deny	1
that	1
in	1
its	1
profoundest	1
idealized	1
significance	1
it	1
calls	1
up	1
a	1
peculiar	1
apparition	1
to	1
the	1
soul.	1
But	1
though	1
without	1
dissent	1
this	1
point	1
be	1
fixed,	1
how	1
is	1
mortal	1
man	1
to	1
account	1
for	1
it?	1
To	1
analyse	1
it,	1
would	1
seem	1
impossible.	1
Can	1
we,	1
then,	1
by	1
the	1
citation	1
of	1
some	1
of	1
those	1
instances	1
wherein	1
this	1
thing	1
of	1
whiteness--though	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
either	1
wholly	1
or	1
in	1
great	1
part	1
stripped	1
of	1
all	1
direct	1
associations	1
calculated	1
to	1
impart	1
to	1
it	1
aught	1
fearful,	1
but	1
nevertheless,	1
is	1
found	1
to	1
exert	1
over	1
us	1
the	1
same	1
sorcery,	1
however	1
modified;--can	1
we	1
thus	1
hope	1
to	1
light	1
upon	1
some	1
chance	1
clue	1
to	1
conduct	1
us	1
to	1
the	1
hidden	1
cause	1
we	1
seek?	1
Let	1
us	1
try.	1
But	1
in	1
a	1
matter	1
like	1
this,	1
subtlety	1
appeals	1
to	1
subtlety,	1
and	1
without	1
imagination	1
no	1
man	1
can	1
follow	1
another	1
into	1
these	1
halls.	1
And	1
though,	1
doubtless,	1
some	1
at	1
least	1
of	1
the	1
imaginative	1
impressions	1
about	1
to	1
be	1
presented	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
shared	1
by	1
most	1
men,	1
yet	1
few	1
perhaps	1
were	1
entirely	1
conscious	1
of	1
them	1
at	1
the	1
time,	1
and	1
therefore	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
recall	1
them	1
now.	1
Why	1
to	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
untutored	1
ideality,	1
who	1
happens	1
to	1
be	1
but	1
loosely	1
acquainted	1
with	1
the	1
peculiar	1
character	1
of	1
the	1
day,	1
does	1
the	1
bare	1
mention	1
of	1
Whitsuntide	1
marshal	1
in	1
the	1
fancy	1
such	1
long,	1
dreary,	1
speechless	1
processions	1
of	1
slow-pacing	1
pilgrims,	1
down-cast	1
and	1
hooded	1
with	1
new-fallen	1
snow?	1
Or,	1
to	1
the	1
unread,	1
unsophisticated	1
Protestant	1
of	1
the	1
Middle	1
American	1
States,	1
why	1
does	1
the	1
passing	1
mention	1
of	1
a	1
White	1
Friar	1
or	1
a	1
White	1
Nun,	1
evoke	1
such	1
an	1
eyeless	1
statue	1
in	1
the	1
soul?	1
Or	1
what	1
is	1
there	1
apart	1
from	1
the	1
traditions	1
of	1
dungeoned	1
warriors	1
and	1
kings	1
(which	1
will	1
not	1
wholly	1
account	1
for	1
it)	1
that	1
makes	1
the	1
White	1
Tower	1
of	1
London	1
tell	1
so	1
much	1
more	1
strongly	1
on	1
the	1
imagination	1
of	1
an	1
untravelled	1
American,	1
than	1
those	1
other	1
storied	1
structures,	1
its	1
neighbors--the	1
Byward	1
Tower,	1
or	1
even	1
the	1
Bloody?	1
And	1
those	1
sublimer	1
towers,	1
the	1
White	1
Mountains	1
of	1
New	1
Hampshire,	1
whence,	1
in	1
peculiar	1
moods,	1
comes	1
that	1
gigantic	1
ghostliness	1
over	1
the	1
soul	1
at	1
the	1
bare	1
mention	1
of	1
that	1
name,	1
while	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
Virginia's	1
Blue	1
Ridge	1
is	1
full	1
of	1
a	1
soft,	1
dewy,	1
distant	1
dreaminess?	1
Or	1
why,	1
irrespective	1
of	1
all	1
latitudes	1
and	1
longitudes,	1
does	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
White	1
Sea	1
exert	1
such	1
a	1
spectralness	1
over	1
the	1
fancy,	1
while	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
Yellow	1
Sea	1
lulls	1
us	1
with	1
mortal	1
thoughts	1
of	1
long	1
lacquered	1
mild	1
afternoons	1
on	1
the	1
waves,	1
followed	1
by	1
the	1
gaudiest	1
and	1
yet	1
sleepiest	1
of	1
sunsets?	1
Or,	1
to	1
choose	1
a	1
wholly	1
unsubstantial	1
instance,	1
purely	1
addressed	1
to	1
the	1
fancy,	1
why,	1
in	1
reading	1
the	1
old	1
fairy	1
tales	1
of	1
Central	1
Europe,	1
does	1
"the	1
tall	1
pale	1
man"	1
of	1
the	1
Hartz	1
forests,	1
whose	1
changeless	1
pallor	1
unrustlingly	1
glides	1
through	1
the	1
green	1
of	1
the	1
groves--why	1
is	1
this	1
phantom	1
more	1
terrible	1
than	1
all	1
the	1
whooping	1
imps	1
of	1
the	1
Blocksburg?	1
Nor	1
is	1
it,	1
altogether,	1
the	1
remembrance	1
of	1
her	1
cathedral-toppling	1
earthquakes;	1
nor	1
the	1
stampedoes	1
of	1
her	1
frantic	1
seas;	1
nor	1
the	1
tearlessness	1
of	1
arid	1
skies	1
that	1
never	1
rain;	1
nor	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
her	1
wide	1
field	1
of	1
leaning	1
spires,	1
wrenched	1
cope-stones,	1
and	1
crosses	1
all	1
adroop	1
(like	1
canted	1
yards	1
of	1
anchored	1
fleets);	1
and	1
her	1
suburban	1
avenues	1
of	1
house-walls	1
lying	1
over	1
upon	1
each	1
other,	1
as	1
a	1
tossed	1
pack	1
of	1
cards;--it	1
is	1
not	1
these	1
things	1
alone	1
which	1
make	1
tearless	1
Lima,	1
the	1
strangest,	1
saddest	1
city	1
thou	1
can'st	1
see.	1
For	1
Lima	1
has	1
taken	1
the	1
white	1
veil;	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
higher	1
horror	1
in	1
this	1
whiteness	1
of	1
her	1
woe.	1
Old	1
as	1
Pizarro,	1
this	1
whiteness	1
keeps	1
her	1
ruins	1
for	1
ever	1
new;	1
admits	1
not	1
the	1
cheerful	1
greenness	1
of	1
complete	1
decay;	1
spreads	1
over	1
her	1
broken	1
ramparts	1
the	1
rigid	1
pallor	1
of	1
an	1
apoplexy	1
that	1
fixes	1
its	1
own	1
distortions.	1
I	1
know	1
that,	1
to	1
the	1
common	1
apprehension,	1
this	1
phenomenon	1
of	1
whiteness	1
is	1
not	1
confessed	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
prime	1
agent	1
in	1
exaggerating	1
the	1
terror	1
of	1
objects	1
otherwise	1
terrible;	1
nor	1
to	1
the	1
unimaginative	1
mind	1
is	1
there	1
aught	1
of	1
terror	1
in	1
those	1
appearances	1
whose	1
awfulness	1
to	1
another	1
mind	1
almost	1
solely	1
consists	1
in	1
this	1
one	1
phenomenon,	1
especially	1
when	1
exhibited	1
under	1
any	1
form	1
at	1
all	1
approaching	1
to	1
muteness	1
or	1
universality.	1
What	1
I	1
mean	1
by	1
these	1
two	1
statements	1
may	1
perhaps	1
be	1
respectively	1
elucidated	1
by	1
the	1
following	1
examples.	1
First:	1
The	1
mariner,	1
when	1
drawing	1
nigh	1
the	1
coasts	1
of	1
foreign	1
lands,	1
if	1
by	1
night	1
he	1
hear	1
the	1
roar	1
of	1
breakers,	1
starts	1
to	1
vigilance,	1
and	1
feels	1
just	1
enough	1
of	1
trepidation	1
to	1
sharpen	1
all	1
his	1
faculties;	1
but	1
under	1
precisely	1
similar	1
circumstances,	1
let	1
him	1
be	1
called	1
from	1
his	1
hammock	1
to	1
view	1
his	1
ship	1
sailing	1
through	1
a	1
midnight	1
sea	1
of	1
milky	1
whiteness--as	1
if	1
from	1
encircling	1
headlands	1
shoals	1
of	1
combed	1
white	1
bears	1
were	1
swimming	1
round	1
him,	1
then	1
he	1
feels	1
a	1
silent,	1
superstitious	1
dread;	1
the	1
shrouded	1
phantom	1
of	1
the	1
whitened	1
waters	1
is	1
horrible	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
real	1
ghost;	1
in	1
vain	1
the	1
lead	1
assures	1
him	1
he	1
is	1
still	1
off	1
soundings;	1
heart	1
and	1
helm	1
they	1
both	1
go	1
down;	1
he	1
never	1
rests	1
till	1
blue	1
water	1
is	1
under	1
him	1
again.	1
Yet	1
where	1
is	1
the	1
mariner	1
who	1
will	1
tell	1
thee,	1
"Sir,	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
striking	1
hidden	1
rocks,	1
as	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
that	1
hideous	1
whiteness	1
that	1
so	1
stirred	1
me?"	1
Second:	1
To	1
the	1
native	1
Indian	1
of	1
Peru,	1
the	1
continual	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
snowhowdahed	1
Andes	1
conveys	1
naught	1
of	1
dread,	1
except,	1
perhaps,	1
in	1
the	1
mere	1
fancying	1
of	1
the	1
eternal	1
frosted	1
desolateness	1
reigning	1
at	1
such	1
vast	1
altitudes,	1
and	1
the	1
natural	1
conceit	1
of	1
what	1
a	1
fearfulness	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
lose	1
oneself	1
in	1
such	1
inhuman	1
solitudes.	1
Much	1
the	1
same	1
is	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
backwoodsman	1
of	1
the	1
West,	1
who	1
with	1
comparative	1
indifference	1
views	1
an	1
unbounded	1
prairie	1
sheeted	1
with	1
driven	1
snow,	1
no	1
shadow	1
of	1
tree	1
or	1
twig	1
to	1
break	1
the	1
fixed	1
trance	1
of	1
whiteness.	1
Not	1
so	1
the	1
sailor,	1
beholding	1
the	1
scenery	1
of	1
the	1
Antarctic	1
seas;	1
where	1
at	1
times,	1
by	1
some	1
infernal	1
trick	1
of	1
legerdemain	1
in	1
the	1
powers	1
of	1
frost	1
and	1
air,	1
he,	1
shivering	1
and	1
half	1
shipwrecked,	1
instead	1
of	1
rainbows	1
speaking	1
hope	1
and	1
solace	1
to	1
his	1
misery,	1
views	1
what	1
seems	1
a	1
boundless	1
churchyard	1
grinning	1
upon	1
him	1
with	1
its	1
lean	1
ice	1
monuments	1
and	1
splintered	1
crosses.	1
But	1
thou	1
sayest,	1
methinks	1
that	1
white-lead	1
chapter	1
about	1
whiteness	1
is	1
but	1
a	1
white	1
flag	1
hung	1
out	1
from	1
a	1
craven	1
soul;	1
thou	1
surrenderest	1
to	1
a	1
hypo,	1
Ishmael.	1
Tell	1
me,	1
why	1
this	1
strong	1
young	1
colt,	1
foaled	1
in	1
some	1
peaceful	1
valley	1
of	1
Vermont,	1
far	1
removed	1
from	1
all	1
beasts	1
of	1
prey--why	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
upon	1
the	1
sunniest	1
day,	1
if	1
you	1
but	1
shake	1
a	1
fresh	1
buffalo	1
robe	1
behind	1
him,	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
cannot	1
even	1
see	1
it,	1
but	1
only	1
smells	1
its	1
wild	1
animal	1
muskiness--why	1
will	1
he	1
start,	1
snort,	1
and	1
with	1
bursting	1
eyes	1
paw	1
the	1
ground	1
in	1
phrensies	1
of	1
affright?	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
remembrance	1
in	1
him	1
of	1
any	1
gorings	1
of	1
wild	1
creatures	1
in	1
his	1
green	1
northern	1
home,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
strange	1
muskiness	1
he	1
smells	1
cannot	1
recall	1
to	1
him	1
anything	1
associated	1
with	1
the	1
experience	1
of	1
former	1
perils;	1
for	1
what	1
knows	1
he,	1
this	1
New	1
England	1
colt,	1
of	1
the	1
black	1
bisons	1
of	1
distant	1
Oregon?	1
No;	1
but	1
here	1
thou	1
beholdest	1
even	1
in	1
a	1
dumb	1
brute,	1
the	1
instinct	1
of	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
demonism	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
Though	1
thousands	1
of	1
miles	1
from	1
Oregon,	1
still	1
when	1
he	1
smells	1
that	1
savage	1
musk,	1
the	1
rending,	1
goring	1
bison	1
herds	1
are	1
as	1
present	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
deserted	1
wild	1
foal	1
of	1
the	1
prairies,	1
which	1
this	1
instant	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
trampling	1
into	1
dust.	1
Thus,	1
then,	1
the	1
muffled	1
rollings	1
of	1
a	1
milky	1
sea;	1
the	1
bleak	1
rustlings	1
of	1
the	1
festooned	1
frosts	1
of	1
mountains;	1
the	1
desolate	1
shiftings	1
of	1
the	1
windrowed	1
snows	1
of	1
prairies;	1
all	1
these,	1
to	1
Ishmael,	1
are	1
as	1
the	1
shaking	1
of	1
that	1
buffalo	1
robe	1
to	1
the	1
frightened	1
colt!	1
Though	1
neither	1
knows	1
where	1
lie	1
the	1
nameless	1
things	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
mystic	1
sign	1
gives	1
forth	1
such	1
hints;	1
yet	1
with	1
me,	1
as	1
with	1
the	1
colt,	1
somewhere	1
those	1
things	1
must	1
exist.	1
Though	1
in	1
many	1
of	1
its	1
aspects	1
this	1
visible	1
world	1
seems	1
formed	1
in	1
love,	1
the	1
invisible	1
spheres	1
were	1
formed	1
in	1
fright.	1
But	1
not	1
yet	1
have	1
we	1
solved	1
the	1
incantation	1
of	1
this	1
whiteness,	1
and	1
learned	1
why	1
it	1
appeals	1
with	1
such	1
power	1
to	1
the	1
soul;	1
and	1
more	1
strange	1
and	1
far	1
more	1
portentous--why,	1
as	1
we	1
have	1
seen,	1
it	1
is	1
at	1
once	1
the	1
most	1
meaning	1
symbol	1
of	1
spiritual	1
things,	1
nay,	1
the	1
very	1
veil	1
of	1
the	1
Christian's	1
Deity;	1
and	1
yet	1
should	1
be	1
as	1
it	1
is,	1
the	1
intensifying	1
agent	1
in	1
things	1
the	1
most	1
appalling	1
to	1
mankind.	1
Is	1
it	1
that	1
by	1
its	1
indefiniteness	1
it	1
shadows	1
forth	1
the	1
heartless	1
voids	1
and	1
immensities	1
of	1
the	1
universe,	1
and	1
thus	1
stabs	1
us	1
from	1
behind	1
with	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
annihilation,	1
when	1
beholding	1
the	1
white	1
depths	1
of	1
the	1
milky	1
way?	1
Or	1
is	1
it,	1
that	1
as	1
in	1
essence	1
whiteness	1
is	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
a	1
colour	1
as	1
the	1
visible	1
absence	1
of	1
colour;	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
the	1
concrete	1
of	1
all	1
colours;	1
is	1
it	1
for	1
these	1
reasons	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
such	1
a	1
dumb	1
blankness,	1
full	1
of	1
meaning,	1
in	1
a	1
wide	1
landscape	1
of	1
snows--a	1
colourless,	1
all-colour	1
of	1
atheism	1
from	1
which	1
we	1
shrink?	1
And	1
when	1
we	1
consider	1
that	1
other	1
theory	1
of	1
the	1
natural	1
philosophers,	1
that	1
all	1
other	1
earthly	1
hues--every	1
stately	1
or	1
lovely	1
emblazoning--the	1
sweet	1
tinges	1
of	1
sunset	1
skies	1
and	1
woods;	1
yea,	1
and	1
the	1
gilded	1
velvets	1
of	1
butterflies,	1
and	1
the	1
butterfly	1
cheeks	1
of	1
young	1
girls;	1
all	1
these	1
are	1
but	1
subtile	1
deceits,	1
not	1
actually	1
inherent	1
in	1
substances,	1
but	1
only	1
laid	1
on	1
from	1
without;	1
so	1
that	1
all	1
deified	1
Nature	1
absolutely	1
paints	1
like	1
the	1
harlot,	1
whose	1
allurements	1
cover	1
nothing	1
but	1
the	1
charnel-house	1
within;	1
and	1
when	1
we	1
proceed	1
further,	1
and	1
consider	1
that	1
the	1
mystical	1
cosmetic	1
which	1
produces	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
hues,	1
the	1
great	1
principle	1
of	1
light,	1
for	1
ever	1
remains	1
white	1
or	1
colourless	1
in	1
itself,	1
and	1
if	1
operating	1
without	1
medium	1
upon	1
matter,	1
would	1
touch	1
all	1
objects,	1
even	1
tulips	1
and	1
roses,	1
with	1
its	1
own	1
blank	1
tinge--pondering	1
all	1
this,	1
the	1
palsied	1
universe	1
lies	1
before	1
us	1
a	1
leper;	1
and	1
like	1
wilful	1
travellers	1
in	1
Lapland,	1
who	1
refuse	1
to	1
wear	1
coloured	1
and	1
colouring	1
glasses	1
upon	1
their	1
eyes,	1
so	1
the	1
wretched	1
infidel	1
gazes	1
himself	1
blind	1
at	1
the	1
monumental	1
white	1
shroud	1
that	1
wraps	1
all	1
the	1
prospect	1
around	1
him.	1
And	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
the	1
Albino	1
whale	1
was	1
the	1
symbol.	1
Wonder	1
ye	1
then	1
at	1
the	1
fiery	1
hunt?	1
CHAPTER	1
43	1
Hark!	1
"HIST!	1
Did	1
you	1
hear	1
that	1
noise,	1
Cabaco?	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
middle-watch;	1
a	1
fair	1
moonlight;	1
the	1
seamen	1
were	1
standing	1
in	1
a	1
cordon,	1
extending	1
from	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
fresh-water	1
butts	1
in	1
the	1
waist,	1
to	1
the	1
scuttle-butt	1
near	1
the	1
taffrail.	1
In	1
this	1
manner,	1
they	1
passed	1
the	1
buckets	1
to	1
fill	1
the	1
scuttle-butt.	1
Standing,	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
part,	1
on	1
the	1
hallowed	1
precincts	1
of	1
the	1
quarter-deck,	1
they	1
were	1
careful	1
not	1
to	1
speak	1
or	1
rustle	1
their	1
feet.	1
From	1
hand	1
to	1
hand,	1
the	1
buckets	1
went	1
in	1
the	1
deepest	1
silence,	1
only	1
broken	1
by	1
the	1
occasional	1
flap	1
of	1
a	1
sail,	1
and	1
the	1
steady	1
hum	1
of	1
the	1
unceasingly	1
advancing	1
keel.	1
It	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
this	1
repose,	1
that	1
Archy,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
cordon,	1
whose	1
post	1
was	1
near	1
the	1
after-hatches,	1
whispered	1
to	1
his	1
neighbor,	1
a	1
Cholo,	1
the	1
words	1
above.	1
"Hist!	1
did	1
you	1
hear	1
that	1
noise,	1
Cabaco?"	1
"Take	1
the	1
bucket,	1
will	1
ye,	1
Archy?	1
what	1
noise	1
d'ye	1
mean?"	1
"There	1
it	1
is	1
again--under	1
the	1
hatches--don't	1
you	1
hear	1
it--a	1
cough--it	1
sounded	1
like	1
a	1
cough."	1
"Cough	1
be	1
damned!	1
Pass	1
along	1
that	1
return	1
bucket."	1
"There	1
again--there	1
it	1
is!--it	1
sounds	1
like	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
sleepers	1
turning	1
over,	1
now!"	1
"Caramba!	1
have	1
done,	1
shipmate,	1
will	1
ye?	1
It's	1
the	1
three	1
soaked	1
biscuits	1
ye	1
eat	1
for	1
supper	1
turning	1
over	1
inside	1
of	1
ye--nothing	1
else.	1
Look	1
to	1
the	1
bucket!"	1
"Say	1
what	1
ye	1
will,	1
shipmate;	1
I've	1
sharp	1
ears."	1
"Aye,	1
you	1
are	1
the	1
chap,	1
ain't	1
ye,	1
that	1
heard	1
the	1
hum	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
Quakeress's	1
knitting-needles	1
fifty	1
miles	1
at	1
sea	1
from	1
Nantucket;	1
you're	1
the	1
chap."	1
"Grin	1
away;	1
we'll	1
see	1
what	1
turns	1
up.	1
Hark	1
ye,	1
Cabaco,	1
there	1
is	1
somebody	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
after-hold	1
that	1
has	1
not	1
yet	1
been	1
seen	1
on	1
deck;	1
and	1
I	1
suspect	1
our	1
old	1
Mogul	1
knows	1
something	1
of	1
it	1
too.	1
I	1
heard	1
Stubb	1
tell	1
Flask,	1
one	1
morning	1
watch,	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
of	1
that	1
sort	1
in	1
the	1
wind."	1
"Tish!	1
the	1
bucket!"	1
CHAPTER	1
44	1
The	1
Chart.	1
Had	1
you	1
followed	1
Captain	1
Ahab	1
down	1
into	1
his	1
cabin	1
after	1
the	1
squall	1
that	1
took	1
place	1
on	1
the	1
night	1
succeeding	1
that	1
wild	1
ratification	1
of	1
his	1
purpose	1
with	1
his	1
crew,	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
seen	1
him	1
go	1
to	1
a	1
locker	1
in	1
the	1
transom,	1
and	1
bringing	1
out	1
a	1
large	1
wrinkled	1
roll	1
of	1
yellowish	1
sea	1
charts,	1
spread	1
them	1
before	1
him	1
on	1
his	1
screwed-down	1
table.	1
Then	1
seating	1
himself	1
before	1
it,	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
seen	1
him	1
intently	1
study	1
the	1
various	1
lines	1
and	1
shadings	1
which	1
there	1
met	1
his	1
eye;	1
and	1
with	1
slow	1
but	1
steady	1
pencil	1
trace	1
additional	1
courses	1
over	1
spaces	1
that	1
before	1
were	1
blank.	1
At	1
intervals,	1
he	1
would	1
refer	1
to	1
piles	1
of	1
old	1
log-books	1
beside	1
him,	1
wherein	1
were	1
set	1
down	1
the	1
seasons	1
and	1
places	1
in	1
which,	1
on	1
various	1
former	1
voyages	1
of	1
various	1
ships,	1
sperm	1
whales	1
had	1
been	1
captured	1
or	1
seen.	1
While	1
thus	1
employed,	1
the	1
heavy	1
pewter	1
lamp	1
suspended	1
in	1
chains	1
over	1
his	1
head,	1
continually	1
rocked	1
with	1
the	1
motion	1
of	1
the	1
ship,	1
and	1
for	1
ever	1
threw	1
shifting	1
gleams	1
and	1
shadows	1
of	1
lines	1
upon	1
his	1
wrinkled	1
brow,	1
till	1
it	1
almost	1
seemed	1
that	1
while	1
he	1
himself	1
was	1
marking	1
out	1
lines	1
and	1
courses	1
on	1
the	1
wrinkled	1
charts,	1
some	1
invisible	1
pencil	1
was	1
also	1
tracing	1
lines	1
and	1
courses	1
upon	1
the	1
deeply	1
marked	1
chart	1
of	1
his	1
forehead.	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
this	1
night	1
in	1
particular	1
that,	1
in	1
the	1
solitude	1
of	1
his	1
cabin,	1
Ahab	1
thus	1
pondered	1
over	1
his	1
charts.	1
Almost	1
every	1
night	1
they	1
were	1
brought	1
out;	1
almost	1
every	1
night	1
some	1
pencil	1
marks	1
were	1
effaced,	1
and	1
others	1
were	1
substituted.	1
For	1
with	1
the	1
charts	1
of	1
all	1
four	1
oceans	1
before	1
him,	1
Ahab	1
was	1
threading	1
a	1
maze	1
of	1
currents	1
and	1
eddies,	1
with	1
a	1
view	1
to	1
the	1
more	1
certain	1
accomplishment	1
of	1
that	1
monomaniac	1
thought	1
of	1
his	1
soul.	1
Now,	1
to	1
any	1
one	1
not	1
fully	1
acquainted	1
with	1
the	1
ways	1
of	1
the	1
leviathans,	1
it	1
might	1
seem	1
an	1
absurdly	1
hopeless	1
task	1
thus	1
to	1
seek	1
out	1
one	1
solitary	1
creature	1
in	1
the	1
unhooped	1
oceans	1
of	1
this	1
planet.	1
But	1
not	1
so	1
did	1
it	1
seem	1
to	1
Ahab,	1
who	1
knew	1
the	1
sets	1
of	1
all	1
tides	1
and	1
currents;	1
and	1
thereby	1
calculating	1
the	1
driftings	1
of	1
the	1
sperm	1
whale's	1
food;	1
and,	1
also,	1
calling	1
to	1
mind	1
the	1
regular,	1
ascertained	1
seasons	1
for	1
hunting	1
him	1
in	1
particular	1
latitudes;	1
could	1
arrive	1
at	1
reasonable	1
surmises,	1
almost	1
approaching	1
to	1
certainties,	1
concerning	1
the	1
timeliest	1
day	1
to	1
be	1
upon	1
this	1
or	1
that	1
ground	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
his	1
prey.	1
So	1
assured,	1
indeed,	1
is	1
the	1
fact	1
concerning	1
the	1
periodicalness	1
of	1
the	1
sperm	1
whale's	1
resorting	1
to	1
given	1
waters,	1
that	1
many	1
hunters	1
believe	1
that,	1
could	1
he	1
be	1
closely	1
observed	1
and	1
studied	1
throughout	1
the	1
world;	1
were	1
the	1
logs	1
for	1
one	1
voyage	1
of	1
the	1
entire	1
whale	1
fleet	1
carefully	1
collated,	1
then	1
the	1
migrations	1
of	1
the	1
sperm	1
whale	1
would	1
be	1
found	1
to	1
correspond	1
in	1
invariability	1
to	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
herring-shoals	1
or	1
the	1
flights	1
of	1
swallows.	1
On	1
this	1
hint,	1
attempts	1
have	1
been	1
made	1
to	1
construct	1
elaborate	1
migratory	1
charts	1
of	1
the	1
sperm	1
whale.*	1
*Since	1
the	1
above	1
was	1
written,	1
the	1
statement	1
is	1
happily	1
borne	1
out	1
by	1
an	1
official	1
circular,	1
issued	1
by	1
Lieutenant	1
Maury,	1
of	1
the	1
National	1
Observatory,	1
Washington,	1
April	1
16th,	1
1851.	1
By	1
that	1
circular,	1
it	1
appears	1
that	1
precisely	1
such	1
a	1
chart	1
is	1
in	1
course	1
of	1
completion;	1
and	1
portions	1
of	1
it	1
are	1
presented	1
in	1
the	1
circular.	1
"This	1
chart	1
divides	1
the	1
ocean	1
into	1
districts	1
of	1
five	1
degrees	1
of	1
latitude	1
by	1
five	1
degrees	1
of	1
longitude;	1
perpendicularly	1
through	1
each	1
of	1
which	1
districts	1
are	1
twelve	1
columns	1
for	1
the	1
twelve	1
months;	1
and	1
horizontally	1
through	1
each	1
of	1
which	1
districts	1
are	1
three	1
lines;	1
one	1
to	1
show	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
days	1
that	1
have	1
been	1
spent	1
in	1
each	1
month	1
in	1
every	1
district,	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
others	1
to	1
show	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
days	1
in	1
which	1
whales,	1
sperm	1
or	1
right,	1
have	1
been	1
seen."	1
Besides,	1
when	1
making	1
a	1
passage	1
from	1
one	1
feeding-ground	1
to	1
another,	1
the	1
sperm	1
whales,	1
guided	1
by	1
some	1
infallible	1
instinct--say,	1
rather,	1
secret	1
intelligence	1
from	1
the	1
Deity--mostly	1
swim	1
in	1
VEINS,	1
as	1
they	1
are	1
called;	1
continuing	1
their	1
way	1
along	1
a	1
given	1
ocean-line	1
with	1
such	1
undeviating	1
exactitude,	1
that	1
no	1
ship	1
ever	1
sailed	1
her	1
course,	1
by	1
any	1
chart,	1
with	1
one	1
tithe	1
of	1
such	1
marvellous	1
precision.	1
Though,	1
in	1
these	1
cases,	1
the	1
direction	1
taken	1
by	1
any	1
one	1
whale	1
be	1
straight	1
as	1
a	1
surveyor's	1
parallel,	1
and	1
though	1
the	1
line	1
of	1
advance	1
be	1
strictly	1
confined	1
to	1
its	1
own	1
unavoidable,	1
straight	1
wake,	1
yet	1
the	1
arbitrary	1
VEIN	1
in	1
which	1
at	1
these	1
times	1
he	1
is	1
said	1
to	1
swim,	1
generally	1
embraces	1
some	1
few	1
miles	1
in	1
width	1
(more	1
or	1
less,	1
as	1
the	1
vein	1
is	1
presumed	1
to	1
expand	1
or	1
contract);	1
but	1
never	1
exceeds	1
the	1
visual	1
sweep	1
from	1
the	1
whale-ship's	1
mast-heads,	1
when	1
circumspectly	1
gliding	1
along	1
this	1
magic	1
zone.	1
The	1
sum	1
is,	1
that	1
at	1
particular	1
seasons	1
within	1
that	1
breadth	1
and	1
along	1
that	1
path,	1
migrating	1
whales	1
may	1
with	1
great	1
confidence	1
be	1
looked	1
for.	1
And	1
hence	1
not	1
only	1
at	1
substantiated	1
times,	1
upon	1
well	1
known	1
separate	1
feeding-grounds,	1
could	1
Ahab	1
hope	1
to	1
encounter	1
his	1
prey;	1
but	1
in	1
crossing	1
the	1
widest	1
expanses	1
of	1
water	1
between	1
those	1
grounds	1
he	1
could,	1
by	1
his	1
art,	1
so	1
place	1
and	1
time	1
himself	1
on	1
his	1
way,	1
as	1
even	1
then	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
wholly	1
without	1
prospect	1
of	1
a	1
meeting.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
circumstance	1
which	1
at	1
first	1
sight	1
seemed	1
to	1
entangle	1
his	1
delirious	1
but	1
still	1
methodical	1
scheme.	1
But	1
not	1
so	1
in	1
the	1
reality,	1
perhaps.	1
Though	1
the	1
gregarious	1
sperm	1
whales	1
have	1
their	1
regular	1
seasons	1
for	1
particular	1
grounds,	1
yet	1
in	1
general	1
you	1
cannot	1
conclude	1
that	1
the	1
herds	1
which	1
haunted	1
such	1
and	1
such	1
a	1
latitude	1
or	1
longitude	1
this	1
year,	1
say,	1
will	1
turn	1
out	1
to	1
be	1
identically	1
the	1
same	1
with	1
those	1
that	1
were	1
found	1
there	1
the	1
preceding	1
season;	1
though	1
there	1
are	1
peculiar	1
and	1
unquestionable	1
instances	1
where	1
the	1
contrary	1
of	1
this	1
has	1
proved	1
true.	1
In	1
general,	1
the	1
same	1
remark,	1
only	1
within	1
a	1
less	1
wide	1
limit,	1
applies	1
to	1
the	1
solitaries	1
and	1
hermits	1
among	1
the	1
matured,	1
aged	1
sperm	1
whales.	1
So	1
that	1
though	1
Moby	1
Dick	1
had	1
in	1
a	1
former	1
year	1
been	1
seen,	1
for	1
example,	1
on	1
what	1
is	1
called	1
the	1
Seychelle	1
ground	1
in	1
the	1
Indian	1
ocean,	1
or	1
Volcano	1
Bay	1
on	1
the	1
Japanese	1
Coast;	1
yet	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
follow,	1
that	1
were	1
the	1
Pequod	1
to	1
visit	1
either	1
of	1
those	1
spots	1
at	1
any	1
subsequent	1
corresponding	1
season,	1
she	1
would	1
infallibly	1
encounter	1
him	1
there.	1
So,	1
too,	1
with	1
some	1
other	1
feeding	1
grounds,	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
at	1
times	1
revealed	1
himself.	1
But	1
all	1
these	1
seemed	1
only	1
his	1
casual	1
stopping-places	1
and	1
ocean-inns,	1
so	1
to	1
speak,	1
not	1
his	1
places	1
of	1
prolonged	1
abode.	1
And	1
where	1
Ahab's	1
chances	1
of	1
accomplishing	1
his	1
object	1
have	1
hitherto	1
been	1
spoken	1
of,	1
allusion	1
has	1
only	1
been	1
made	1
to	1
whatever	1
way-side,	1
antecedent,	1
extra	1
prospects	1
were	1
his,	1
ere	1
a	1
particular	1
set	1
time	1
or	1
place	1
were	1
attained,	1
when	1
all	1
possibilities	1
would	1
become	1
probabilities,	1
and,	1
as	1
Ahab	1
fondly	1
thought,	1
every	1
possibility	1
the	1
next	1
thing	1
to	1
a	1
certainty.	1
That	1
particular	1
set	1
time	1
and	1
place	1
were	1
conjoined	1
in	1
the	1
one	1
technical	1
phrase--the	1
Season-on-the-Line.	1
For	1
there	1
and	1
then,	1
for	1
several	1
consecutive	1
years,	1
Moby	1
Dick	1
had	1
been	1
periodically	1
descried,	1
lingering	1
in	1
those	1
waters	1
for	1
awhile,	1
as	1
the	1
sun,	1
in	1
its	1
annual	1
round,	1
loiters	1
for	1
a	1
predicted	1
interval	1
in	1
any	1
one	1
sign	1
of	1
the	1
Zodiac.	1
There	1
it	1
was,	1
too,	1
that	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
deadly	1
encounters	1
with	1
the	1
white	1
whale	1
had	1
taken	1
place;	1
there	1
the	1
waves	1
were	1
storied	1
with	1
his	1
deeds;	1
there	1
also	1
was	1
that	1
tragic	1
spot	1
where	1
the	1
monomaniac	1
old	1
man	1
had	1
found	1
the	1
awful	1
motive	1
to	1
his	1
vengeance.	1
But	1
in	1
the	1
cautious	1
comprehensiveness	1
and	1
unloitering	1
vigilance	1
with	1
which	1
Ahab	1
threw	1
his	1
brooding	1
soul	1
into	1
this	1
unfaltering	1
hunt,	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
permit	1
himself	1
to	1
rest	1
all	1
his	1
hopes	1
upon	1
the	1
one	1
crowning	1
fact	1
above	1
mentioned,	1
however	1
flattering	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
to	1
those	1
hopes;	1
nor	1
in	1
the	1
sleeplessness	1
of	1
his	1
vow	1
could	1
he	1
so	1
tranquillize	1
his	1
unquiet	1
heart	1
as	1
to	1
postpone	1
all	1
intervening	1
quest.	1
Now,	1
the	1
Pequod	1
had	1
sailed	1
from	1
Nantucket	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
Season-on-the-Line.	1
No	1
possible	1
endeavor	1
then	1
could	1
enable	1
her	1
commander	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
great	1
passage	1
southwards,	1
double	1
Cape	1
Horn,	1
and	1
then	1
running	1
down	1
sixty	1
degrees	1
of	1
latitude	1
arrive	1
in	1
the	1
equatorial	1
Pacific	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
cruise	1
there.	1
Therefore,	1
he	1
must	1
wait	1
for	1
the	1
next	1
ensuing	1
season.	1
Yet	1
the	1
premature	1
hour	1
of	1
the	1
Pequod's	1
sailing	1
had,	1
perhaps,	1
been	1
correctly	1
selected	1
by	1
Ahab,	1
with	1
a	1
view	1
to	1
this	1
very	1
complexion	1
of	1
things.	1
Because,	1
an	1
interval	1
of	1
three	1
hundred	1
and	1
sixty-five	1
days	1
and	1
nights	1
was	1
before	1
him;	1
an	1
interval	1
which,	1
instead	1
of	1
impatiently	1
enduring	1
ashore,	1
he	1
would	1
spend	1
in	1
a	1
miscellaneous	1
hunt;	1
if	1
by	1
chance	1
the	1
White	1
Whale,	1
spending	1
his	1
vacation	1
in	1
seas	1
far	1
remote	1
from	1
his	1
periodical	1
feeding-grounds,	1
should	1
turn	1
up	1
his	1
wrinkled	1
brow	1
off	1
the	1
Persian	1
Gulf,	1
or	1
in	1
the	1
Bengal	1
Bay,	1
or	1
China	1
Seas,	1
or	1
in	1
any	1
other	1
waters	1
haunted	1
by	1
his	1
race.	1
So	1
that	1
Monsoons,	1
Pampas,	1
Nor'-Westers,	1
Harmattans,	1
Trades;	1
any	1
wind	1
but	1
the	1
Levanter	1
and	1
Simoon,	1
might	1
blow	1
Moby	1
Dick	1
into	1
the	1
devious	1
zig-zag	1
world-circle	1
of	1
the	1
Pequod's	1
circumnavigating	1
wake.	1
But	1
granting	1
all	1
this;	1
yet,	1
regarded	1
discreetly	1
and	1
coolly,	1
seems	1
it	1
not	1
but	1
a	1
mad	1
idea,	1
this;	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
broad	1
boundless	1
ocean,	1
one	1
solitary	1
whale,	1
even	1
if	1
encountered,	1
should	1
be	1
thought	1
capable	1
of	1
individual	1
recognition	1
from	1
his	1
hunter,	1
even	1
as	1
a	1
white-bearded	1
Mufti	1
in	1
the	1
thronged	1
thoroughfares	1
of	1
Constantinople?	1
Yes.	1
For	1
the	1
peculiar	1
snow-white	1
brow	1
of	1
Moby	1
Dick,	1
and	1
his	1
snow-white	1
hump,	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
be	1
unmistakable.	1
And	1
have	1
I	1
not	1
tallied	1
the	1
whale,	1
Ahab	1
would	1
mutter	1
to	1
himself,	1
as	1
after	1
poring	1
over	1
his	1
charts	1
till	1
long	1
after	1
midnight	1
he	1
would	1
throw	1
himself	1
back	1
in	1
reveries--tallied	1
him,	1
and	1
shall	1
he	1
escape?	1
His	1
broad	1
fins	1
are	1
bored,	1
and	1
scalloped	1
out	1
like	1
a	1
lost	1
sheep's	1
ear!	1
And	1
here,	1
his	1
mad	1
mind	1
would	1
run	1
on	1
in	1
a	1
breathless	1
race;	1
till	1
a	1
weariness	1
and	1
faintness	1
of	1
pondering	1
came	1
over	1
him;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
open	1
air	1
of	1
the	1
deck	1
he	1
would	1
seek	1
to	1
recover	1
his	1
strength.	1
Ah,	1
God!	1
what	1
trances	1
of	1
torments	1
does	1
that	1
man	1
endure	1
who	1
is	1
consumed	1
with	1
one	1
unachieved	1
revengeful	1
desire.	1
He	1
sleeps	1
with	1
clenched	1
hands;	1
and	1
wakes	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
bloody	1
nails	1
in	1
his	1
palms.	1
Often,	1
when	1
forced	1
from	1
his	1
hammock	1
by	1
exhausting	1
and	1
intolerably	1
vivid	1
dreams	1
of	1
the	1
night,	1
which,	1
resuming	1
his	1
own	1
intense	1
thoughts	1
through	1
the	1
day,	1
carried	1
them	1
on	1
amid	1
a	1
clashing	1
of	1
phrensies,	1
and	1
whirled	1
them	1
round	1
and	1
round	1
and	1
round	1
in	1
his	1
blazing	1
brain,	1
till	1
the	1
very	1
throbbing	1
of	1
his	1
life-spot	1
became	1
insufferable	1
anguish;	1
and	1
when,	1
as	1
was	1
sometimes	1
the	1
case,	1
these	1
spiritual	1
throes	1
in	1
him	1
heaved	1
his	1
being	1
up	1
from	1
its	1
base,	1
and	1
a	1
chasm	1
seemed	1
opening	1
in	1
him,	1
from	1
which	1
forked	1
flames	1
and	1
lightnings	1
shot	1
up,	1
and	1
accursed	1
fiends	1
beckoned	1
him	1
to	1
leap	1
down	1
among	1
them;	1
when	1
this	1
hell	1
in	1
himself	1
yawned	1
beneath	1
him,	1
a	1
wild	1
cry	1
would	1
be	1
heard	1
through	1
the	1
ship;	1
and	1
with	1
glaring	1
eyes	1
Ahab	1
would	1
burst	1
from	1
his	1
state	1
room,	1
as	1
though	1
escaping	1
from	1
a	1
bed	1
that	1
was	1
on	1
fire.	1
Yet	1
these,	1
perhaps,	1
instead	1
of	1
being	1
the	1
unsuppressable	1
symptoms	1
of	1
some	1
latent	1
weakness,	1
or	1
fright	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
resolve,	1
were	1
but	1
the	1
plainest	1
tokens	1
of	1
its	1
intensity.	1
For,	1
at	1
such	1
times,	1
crazy	1
Ahab,	1
the	1
scheming,	1
unappeasedly	1
steadfast	1
hunter	1
of	1
the	1
white	1
whale;	1
this	1
Ahab	1
that	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
his	1
hammock,	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
agent	1
that	1
so	1
caused	1
him	1
to	1
burst	1
from	1
it	1
in	1
horror	1
again.	1
The	1
latter	1
was	1
the	1
eternal,	1
living	1
principle	1
or	1
soul	1
in	1
him;	1
and	1
in	1
sleep,	1
being	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
dissociated	1
from	1
the	1
characterizing	1
mind,	1
which	1
at	1
other	1
times	1
employed	1
it	1
for	1
its	1
outer	1
vehicle	1
or	1
agent,	1
it	1
spontaneously	1
sought	1
escape	1
from	1
the	1
scorching	1
contiguity	1
of	1
the	1
frantic	1
thing,	1
of	1
which,	1
for	1
the	1
time,	1
it	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
an	1
integral.	1
But	1
as	1
the	1
mind	1
does	1
not	1
exist	1
unless	1
leagued	1
with	1
the	1
soul,	1
therefore	1
it	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
that,	1
in	1
Ahab's	1
case,	1
yielding	1
up	1
all	1
his	1
thoughts	1
and	1
fancies	1
to	1
his	1
one	1
supreme	1
purpose;	1
that	1
purpose,	1
by	1
its	1
own	1
sheer	1
inveteracy	1
of	1
will,	1
forced	1
itself	1
against	1
gods	1
and	1
devils	1
into	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
self-assumed,	1
independent	1
being	1
of	1
its	1
own.	1
Nay,	1
could	1
grimly	1
live	1
and	1
burn,	1
while	1
the	1
common	1
vitality	1
to	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
conjoined,	1
fled	1
horror-stricken	1
from	1
the	1
unbidden	1
and	1
unfathered	1
birth.	1
Therefore,	1
the	1
tormented	1
spirit	1
that	1
glared	1
out	1
of	1
bodily	1
eyes,	1
when	1
what	1
seemed	1
Ahab	1
rushed	1
from	1
his	1
room,	1
was	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
but	1
a	1
vacated	1
thing,	1
a	1
formless	1
somnambulistic	1
being,	1
a	1
ray	1
of	1
living	1
light,	1
to	1
be	1
sure,	1
but	1
without	1
an	1
object	1
to	1
colour,	1
and	1
therefore	1
a	1
blankness	1
in	1
itself.	1
God	1
help	1
thee,	1
old	1
man,	1
thy	1
thoughts	1
have	1
created	1
a	1
creature	1
in	1
thee;	1
and	1
he	1
whose	1
intense	1
thinking	1
thus	1
makes	1
him	1
a	1
Prometheus;	1
a	1
vulture	1
feeds	1
upon	1
that	1
heart	1
for	1
ever;	1
that	1
vulture	1
the	1
very	1
creature	1
he	1
creates.	1
CHAPTER	1
45	1
The	1
Affidavit.	1
So	1
far	1
as	1
what	1
there	1
may	1
be	1
of	1
a	1
narrative	1
in	1
this	1
book;	1
and,	1
indeed,	1
as	1
indirectly	1
touching	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
very	1
interesting	1
and	1
curious	1
particulars	1
in	1
the	1
habits	1
of	1
sperm	1
whales,	1
the	1
foregoing	1
chapter,	1
in	1
its	1
earlier	1
part,	1
is	1
as	1
important	1
a	1
one	1
as	1
will	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
this	1
volume;	1
but	1
the	1
leading	1
matter	1
of	1
it	1
requires	1
to	1
be	1
still	1
further	1
and	1
more	1
familiarly	1
enlarged	1
upon,	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
be	1
adequately	1
understood,	1
and	1
moreover	1
to	1
take	1
away	1
any	1
incredulity	1
which	1
a	1
profound	1
ignorance	1
of	1
the	1
entire	1
subject	1
may	1
induce	1
in	1
some	1
minds,	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
natural	1
verity	1
of	1
the	1
main	1
points	1
of	1
this	1
affair.	1
I	1
care	1
not	1
to	1
perform	1
this	1
part	1
of	1
my	1
task	1
methodically;	1
but	1
shall	1
be	1
content	1
to	1
produce	1
the	1
desired	1
impression	1
by	1
separate	1
citations	1
of	1
items,	1
practically	1
or	1
reliably	1
known	1
to	1
me	1
as	1
a	1
whaleman;	1
and	1
from	1
these	1
citations,	1
I	1
take	1
it--the	1
conclusion	1
aimed	1
at	1
will	1
naturally	1
follow	1
of	1
itself.	1
First:	1
I	1
have	1
personally	1
known	1
three	1
instances	1
where	1
a	1
whale,	1
after	1
receiving	1
a	1
harpoon,	1
has	1
effected	1
a	1
complete	1
escape;	1
and,	1
after	1
an	1
interval	1
(in	1
one	1
instance	1
of	1
three	1
years),	1
has	1
been	1
again	1
struck	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
hand,	1
and	1
slain;	1
when	1
the	1
two	1
irons,	1
both	1
marked	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
private	1
cypher,	1
have	1
been	1
taken	1
from	1
the	1
body.	1
In	1
the	1
instance	1
where	1
three	1
years	1
intervened	1
between	1
the	1
flinging	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
harpoons;	1
and	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
something	1
more	1
than	1
that;	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
darted	1
them	1
happening,	1
in	1
the	1
interval,	1
to	1
go	1
in	1
a	1
trading	1
ship	1
on	1
a	1
voyage	1
to	1
Africa,	1
went	1
ashore	1
there,	1
joined	1
a	1
discovery	1
party,	1
and	1
penetrated	1
far	1
into	1
the	1
interior,	1
where	1
he	1
travelled	1
for	1
a	1
period	1
of	1
nearly	1
two	1
years,	1
often	1
endangered	1
by	1
serpents,	1
savages,	1
tigers,	1
poisonous	1
miasmas,	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
other	1
common	1
perils	1
incident	1
to	1
wandering	1
in	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
unknown	1
regions.	1
Meanwhile,	1
the	1
whale	1
he	1
had	1
struck	1
must	1
also	1
have	1
been	1
on	1
its	1
travels;	1
no	1
doubt	1
it	1
had	1
thrice	1
circumnavigated	1
the	1
globe,	1
brushing	1
with	1
its	1
flanks	1
all	1
the	1
coasts	1
of	1
Africa;	1
but	1
to	1
no	1
purpose.	1
This	1
man	1
and	1
this	1
whale	1
again	1
came	1
together,	1
and	1
the	1
one	1
vanquished	1
the	1
other.	1
I	1
say	1
I,	1
myself,	1
have	1
known	1
three	1
instances	1
similar	1
to	1
this;	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
two	1
of	1
them	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
whales	1
struck;	1
and,	1
upon	1
the	1
second	1
attack,	1
saw	1
the	1
two	1
irons	1
with	1
the	1
respective	1
marks	1
cut	1
in	1
them,	1
afterwards	1
taken	1
from	1
the	1
dead	1
fish.	1
In	1
the	1
three-year	1
instance,	1
it	1
so	1
fell	1
out	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
boat	1
both	1
times,	1
first	1
and	1
last,	1
and	1
the	1
last	1
time	1
distinctly	1
recognised	1
a	1
peculiar	1
sort	1
of	1
huge	1
mole	1
under	1
the	1
whale's	1
eye,	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
observed	1
there	1
three	1
years	1
previous.	1
I	1
say	1
three	1
years,	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
pretty	1
sure	1
it	1
was	1
more	1
than	1
that.	1
Here	1
are	1
three	1
instances,	1
then,	1
which	1
I	1
personally	1
know	1
the	1
truth	1
of;	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
many	1
other	1
instances	1
from	1
persons	1
whose	1
veracity	1
in	1
the	1
matter	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
good	1
ground	1
to	1
impeach.	1
Secondly:	1
It	1
is	1
well	1
known	1
in	1
the	1
Sperm	1
Whale	1
Fishery,	1
however	1
ignorant	1
the	1
world	1
ashore	1
may	1
be	1
of	1
it,	1
that	1
there	1
have	1
been	1
several	1
memorable	1
historical	1
instances	1
where	1
a	1
particular	1
whale	1
in	1
the	1
ocean	1
has	1
been	1
at	1
distant	1
times	1
and	1
places	1
popularly	1
cognisable.	1
Why	1
such	1
a	1
whale	1
became	1
thus	1
marked	1
was	1
not	1
altogether	1
and	1
originally	1
owing	1
to	1
his	1
bodily	1
peculiarities	1
as	1
distinguished	1
from	1
other	1
whales;	1
for	1
however	1
peculiar	1
in	1
that	1
respect	1
any	1
chance	1
whale	1
may	1
be,	1
they	1
soon	1
put	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
his	1
peculiarities	1
by	1
killing	1
him,	1
and	1
boiling	1
him	1
down	1
into	1
a	1
peculiarly	1
valuable	1
oil.	1
No:	1
the	1
reason	1
was	1
this:	1
that	1
from	1
the	1
fatal	1
experiences	1
of	1
the	1
fishery	1
there	1
hung	1
a	1
terrible	1
prestige	1
of	1
perilousness	1
about	1
such	1
a	1
whale	1
as	1
there	1
did	1
about	1
Rinaldo	1
Rinaldini,	1
insomuch	1
that	1
most	1
fishermen	1
were	1
content	1
to	1
recognise	1
him	1
by	1
merely	1
touching	1
their	1
tarpaulins	1
when	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
discovered	1
lounging	1
by	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
sea,	1
without	1
seeking	1
to	1
cultivate	1
a	1
more	1
intimate	1
acquaintance.	1
Like	1
some	1
poor	1
devils	1
ashore	1
that	1
happen	1
to	1
know	1
an	1
irascible	1
great	1
man,	1
they	1
make	1
distant	1
unobtrusive	1
salutations	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
street,	1
lest	1
if	1
they	1
pursued	1
the	1
acquaintance	1
further,	1
they	1
might	1
receive	1
a	1
summary	1
thump	1
for	1
their	1
presumption.	1
But	1
not	1
only	1
did	1
each	1
of	1
these	1
famous	1
whales	1
enjoy	1
great	1
individual	1
celebrity--Nay,	1
you	1
may	1
call	1
it	1
an	1
ocean-wide	1
renown;	1
not	1
only	1
was	1
he	1
famous	1
in	1
life	1
and	1
now	1
is	1
immortal	1
in	1
forecastle	1
stories	1
after	1
death,	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
admitted	1
into	1
all	1
the	1
rights,	1
privileges,	1
and	1
distinctions	1
of	1
a	1
name;	1
had	1
as	1
much	1
a	1
name	1
indeed	1
as	1
Cambyses	1
or	1
Caesar.	1
Was	1
it	1
not	1
so,	1
O	1
Timor	1
Tom!	1
thou	1
famed	1
leviathan,	1
scarred	1
like	1
an	1
iceberg,	1
who	1
so	1
long	1
did'st	1
lurk	1
in	1
the	1
Oriental	1
straits	1
of	1
that	1
name,	1
whose	1
spout	1
was	1
oft	1
seen	1
from	1
the	1
palmy	1
beach	1
of	1
Ombay?	1
Was	1
it	1
not	1
so,	1
O	1
New	1
Zealand	1
Jack!	1
thou	1
terror	1
of	1
all	1
cruisers	1
that	1
crossed	1
their	1
wakes	1
in	1
the	1
vicinity	1
of	1
the	1
Tattoo	1
Land?	1
Was	1
it	1
not	1
so,	1
O	1
Morquan!	1
King	1
of	1
Japan,	1
whose	1
lofty	1
jet	1
they	1
say	1
at	1
times	1
assumed	1
the	1
semblance	1
of	1
a	1
snow-white	1
cross	1
against	1
the	1
sky?	1
Was	1
it	1
not	1
so,	1
O	1
Don	1
Miguel!	1
thou	1
Chilian	1
whale,	1
marked	1
like	1
an	1
old	1
tortoise	1
with	1
mystic	1
hieroglyphics	1
upon	1
the	1
back!	1
In	1
plain	1
prose,	1
here	1
are	1
four	1
whales	1
as	1
well	1
known	1
to	1
the	1
students	1
of	1
Cetacean	1
History	1
as	1
Marius	1
or	1
Sylla	1
to	1
the	1
classic	1
scholar.	1
But	1
this	1
is	1
not	1
all.	1
New	1
Zealand	1
Tom	1
and	1
Don	1
Miguel,	1
after	1
at	1
various	1
times	1
creating	1
great	1
havoc	1
among	1
the	1
boats	1
of	1
different	1
vessels,	1
were	1
finally	1
gone	1
in	1
quest	1
of,	1
systematically	1
hunted	1
out,	1
chased	1
and	1
killed	1
by	1
valiant	1
whaling	1
captains,	1
who	1
heaved	1
up	1
their	1
anchors	1
with	1
that	1
express	1
object	1
as	1
much	1
in	1
view,	1
as	1
in	1
setting	1
out	1
through	1
the	1
Narragansett	1
Woods,	1
Captain	1
Butler	1
of	1
old	1
had	1
it	1
in	1
his	1
mind	1
to	1
capture	1
that	1
notorious	1
murderous	1
savage	1
Annawon,	1
the	1
headmost	1
warrior	1
of	1
the	1
Indian	1
King	1
Philip.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
where	1
I	1
can	1
find	1
a	1
better	1
place	1
than	1
just	1
here,	1
to	1
make	1
mention	1
of	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
other	1
things,	1
which	1
to	1
me	1
seem	1
important,	1
as	1
in	1
printed	1
form	1
establishing	1
in	1
all	1
respects	1
the	1
reasonableness	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
story	1
of	1
the	1
White	1
Whale,	1
more	1
especially	1
the	1
catastrophe.	1
For	1
this	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
disheartening	1
instances	1
where	1
truth	1
requires	1
full	1
as	1
much	1
bolstering	1
as	1
error.	1
So	1
ignorant	1
are	1
most	1
landsmen	1
of	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
plainest	1
and	1
most	1
palpable	1
wonders	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
that	1
without	1
some	1
hints	1
touching	1
the	1
plain	1
facts,	1
historical	1
and	1
otherwise,	1
of	1
the	1
fishery,	1
they	1
might	1
scout	1
at	1
Moby	1
Dick	1
as	1
a	1
monstrous	1
fable,	1
or	1
still	1
worse	1
and	1
more	1
detestable,	1
a	1
hideous	1
and	1
intolerable	1
allegory.	1
First:	1
Though	1
most	1
men	1
have	1
some	1
vague	1
flitting	1
ideas	1
of	1
the	1
general	1
perils	1
of	1
the	1
grand	1
fishery,	1
yet	1
they	1
have	1
nothing	1
like	1
a	1
fixed,	1
vivid	1
conception	1
of	1
those	1
perils,	1
and	1
the	1
frequency	1
with	1
which	1
they	1
recur.	1
One	1
reason	1
perhaps	1
is,	1
that	1
not	1
one	1
in	1
fifty	1
of	1
the	1
actual	1
disasters	1
and	1
deaths	1
by	1
casualties	1
in	1
the	1
fishery,	1
ever	1
finds	1
a	1
public	1
record	1
at	1
home,	1
however	1
transient	1
and	1
immediately	1
forgotten	1
that	1
record.	1
Do	1
you	1
suppose	1
that	1
that	1
poor	1
fellow	1
there,	1
who	1
this	1
moment	1
perhaps	1
caught	1
by	1
the	1
whale-line	1
off	1
the	1
coast	1
of	1
New	1
Guinea,	1
is	1
being	1
carried	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
by	1
the	1
sounding	1
leviathan--do	1
you	1
suppose	1
that	1
that	1
poor	1
fellow's	1
name	1
will	1
appear	1
in	1
the	1
newspaper	1
obituary	1
you	1
will	1
read	1
to-morrow	1
at	1
your	1
breakfast?	1
No:	1
because	1
the	1
mails	1
are	1
very	1
irregular	1
between	1
here	1
and	1
New	1
Guinea.	1
In	1
fact,	1
did	1
you	1
ever	1
hear	1
what	1
might	1
be	1
called	1
regular	1
news	1
direct	1
or	1
indirect	1
from	1
New	1
Guinea?	1
Yet	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
upon	1
one	1
particular	1
voyage	1
which	1
I	1
made	1
to	1
the	1
Pacific,	1
among	1
many	1
others	1
we	1
spoke	1
thirty	1
different	1
ships,	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
which	1
had	1
had	1
a	1
death	1
by	1
a	1
whale,	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
more	1
than	1
one,	1
and	1
three	1
that	1
had	1
each	1
lost	1
a	1
boat's	1
crew.	1
For	1
God's	1
sake,	1
be	1
economical	1
with	1
your	1
lamps	1
and	1
candles!	1
not	1
a	1
gallon	1
you	1
burn,	1
but	1
at	1
least	1
one	1
drop	1
of	1
man's	1
blood	1
was	1
spilled	1
for	1
it.	1
Secondly:	1
People	1
ashore	1
have	1
indeed	1
some	1
indefinite	1
idea	1
that	1
a	1
whale	1
is	1
an	1
enormous	1
creature	1
of	1
enormous	1
power;	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
ever	1
found	1
that	1
when	1
narrating	1
to	1
them	1
some	1
specific	1
example	1
of	1
this	1
two-fold	1
enormousness,	1
they	1
have	1
significantly	1
complimented	1
me	1
upon	1
my	1
facetiousness;	1
when,	1
I	1
declare	1
upon	1
my	1
soul,	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
more	1
idea	1
of	1
being	1
facetious	1
than	1
Moses,	1
when	1
he	1
wrote	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
the	1
plagues	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
But	1
fortunately	1
the	1
special	1
point	1
I	1
here	1
seek	1
can	1
be	1
established	1
upon	1
testimony	1
entirely	1
independent	1
of	1
my	1
own.	1
That	1
point	1
is	1
this:	1
The	1
Sperm	1
Whale	1
is	1
in	1
some	1
cases	1
sufficiently	1
powerful,	1
knowing,	1
and	1
judiciously	1
malicious,	1
as	1
with	1
direct	1
aforethought	1
to	1
stave	1
in,	1
utterly	1
destroy,	1
and	1
sink	1
a	1
large	1
ship;	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
more,	1
the	1
Sperm	1
Whale	1
HAS	1
done	1
it.	1
First:	1
In	1
the	1
year	1
1820	1
the	1
ship	1
Essex,	1
Captain	1
Pollard,	1
of	1
Nantucket,	1
was	1
cruising	1
in	1
the	1
Pacific	1
Ocean.	1
One	1
day	1
she	1
saw	1
spouts,	1
lowered	1
her	1
boats,	1
and	1
gave	1
chase	1
to	1
a	1
shoal	1
of	1
sperm	1
whales.	1
Ere	1
long,	1
several	1
of	1
the	1
whales	1
were	1
wounded;	1
when,	1
suddenly,	1
a	1
very	1
large	1
whale	1
escaping	1
from	1
the	1
boats,	1
issued	1
from	1
the	1
shoal,	1
and	1
bore	1
directly	1
down	1
upon	1
the	1
ship.	1
Dashing	1
his	1
forehead	1
against	1
her	1
hull,	1
he	1
so	1
stove	1
her	1
in,	1
that	1
in	1
less	1
than	1
"ten	1
minutes"	1
she	1
settled	1
down	1
and	1
fell	1
over.	1
Not	1
a	1
surviving	1
plank	1
of	1
her	1
has	1
been	1
seen	1
since.	1
After	1
the	1
severest	1
exposure,	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
crew	1
reached	1
the	1
land	1
in	1
their	1
boats.	1
Being	1
returned	1
home	1
at	1
last,	1
Captain	1
Pollard	1
once	1
more	1
sailed	1
for	1
the	1
Pacific	1
in	1
command	1
of	1
another	1
ship,	1
but	1
the	1
gods	1
shipwrecked	1
him	1
again	1
upon	1
unknown	1
rocks	1
and	1
breakers;	1
for	1
the	1
second	1
time	1
his	1
ship	1
was	1
utterly	1
lost,	1
and	1
forthwith	1
forswearing	1
the	1
sea,	1
he	1
has	1
never	1
tempted	1
it	1
since.	1
At	1
this	1
day	1
Captain	1
Pollard	1
is	1
a	1
resident	1
of	1
Nantucket.	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
Owen	1
Chace,	1
who	1
was	1
chief	1
mate	1
of	1
the	1
Essex	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
tragedy;	1
I	1
have	1
read	1
his	1
plain	1
and	1
faithful	1
narrative;	1
I	1
have	1
conversed	1
with	1
his	1
son;	1
and	1
all	1
this	1
within	1
a	1
few	1
miles	1
of	1
the	1
scene	1
of	1
the	1
catastrophe.*	1
*The	1
following	1
are	1
extracts	1
from	1
Chace's	1
narrative:	1
"Every	1
fact	1
seemed	1
to	1
warrant	1
me	1
in	1
concluding	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
anything	1
but	1
chance	1
which	1
directed	1
his	1
operations;	1
he	1
made	1
two	1
several	1
attacks	1
upon	1
the	1
ship,	1
at	1
a	1
short	1
interval	1
between	1
them,	1
both	1
of	1
which,	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
direction,	1
were	1
calculated	1
to	1
do	1
us	1
the	1
most	1
injury,	1
by	1
being	1
made	1
ahead,	1
and	1
thereby	1
combining	1
the	1
speed	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
objects	1
for	1
the	1
shock;	1
to	1
effect	1
which,	1
the	1
exact	1
manoeuvres	1
which	1
he	1
made	1
were	1
necessary.	1
His	1
aspect	1
was	1
most	1
horrible,	1
and	1
such	1
as	1
indicated	1
resentment	1
and	1
fury.	1
He	1
came	1
directly	1
from	1
the	1
shoal	1
which	1
we	1
had	1
just	1
before	1
entered,	1
and	1
in	1
which	1
we	1
had	1
struck	1
three	1
of	1
his	1
companions,	1
as	1
if	1
fired	1
with	1
revenge	1
for	1
their	1
sufferings."	1
Again:	1
"At	1
all	1
events,	1
the	1
whole	1
circumstances	1
taken	1
together,	1
all	1
happening	1
before	1
my	1
own	1
eyes,	1
and	1
producing,	1
at	1
the	1
time,	1
impressions	1
in	1
my	1
mind	1
of	1
decided,	1
calculating	1
mischief,	1
on	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
whale	1
(many	1
of	1
which	1
impressions	1
I	1
cannot	1
now	1
recall),	1
induce	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
satisfied	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
correct	1
in	1
my	1
opinion."	1
Here	1
are	1
his	1
reflections	1
some	1
time	1
after	1
quitting	1
the	1
ship,	1
during	1
a	1
black	1
night	1
an	1
open	1
boat,	1
when	1
almost	1
despairing	1
of	1
reaching	1
any	1
hospitable	1
shore.	1
"The	1
dark	1
ocean	1
and	1
swelling	1
waters	1
were	1
nothing;	1
the	1
fears	1
of	1
being	1
swallowed	1
up	1
by	1
some	1
dreadful	1
tempest,	1
or	1
dashed	1
upon	1
hidden	1
rocks,	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
other	1
ordinary	1
subjects	1
of	1
fearful	1
contemplation,	1
seemed	1
scarcely	1
entitled	1
to	1
a	1
moment's	1
thought;	1
the	1
dismal	1
looking	1
wreck,	1
and	1
THE	1
HORRID	1
ASPECT	1
AND	1
REVENGE	1
OF	1
THE	1
WHALE,	1
wholly	1
engrossed	1
my	1
reflections,	1
until	1
day	1
again	1
made	1
its	1
appearance."	1
In	1
another	1
place--p.	1
45,--he	1
speaks	1
of	1
"THE	1
MYSTERIOUS	1
AND	1
MORTAL	1
ATTACK	1
OF	1
THE	1
ANIMAL."	1
Secondly:	1
The	1
ship	1
Union,	1
also	1
of	1
Nantucket,	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
year	1
1807	1
totally	1
lost	1
off	1
the	1
Azores	1
by	1
a	1
similar	1
onset,	1
but	1
the	1
authentic	1
particulars	1
of	1
this	1
catastrophe	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
chanced	1
to	1
encounter,	1
though	1
from	1
the	1
whale	1
hunters	1
I	1
have	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
heard	1
casual	1
allusions	1
to	1
it.	1
Thirdly:	1
Some	1
eighteen	1
or	1
twenty	1
years	1
ago	1
Commodore	1
J---,	1
then	1
commanding	1
an	1
American	1
sloop-of-war	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
class,	1
happened	1
to	1
be	1
dining	1
with	1
a	1
party	1
of	1
whaling	1
captains,	1
on	1
board	1
a	1
Nantucket	1
ship	1
in	1
the	1
harbor	1
of	1
Oahu,	1
Sandwich	1
Islands.	1
Conversation	1
turning	1
upon	1
whales,	1
the	1
Commodore	1
was	1
pleased	1
to	1
be	1
sceptical	1
touching	1
the	1
amazing	1
strength	1
ascribed	1
to	1
them	1
by	1
the	1
professional	1
gentlemen	1
present.	1
He	1
peremptorily	1
denied	1
for	1
example,	1
that	1
any	1
whale	1
could	1
so	1
smite	1
his	1
stout	1
sloop-of-war	1
as	1
to	1
cause	1
her	1
to	1
leak	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
a	1
thimbleful.	1
Very	1
good;	1
but	1
there	1
is	1
more	1
coming.	1
Some	1
weeks	1
after,	1
the	1
Commodore	1
set	1
sail	1
in	1
this	1
impregnable	1
craft	1
for	1
Valparaiso.	1
But	1
he	1
was	1
stopped	1
on	1
the	1
way	1
by	1
a	1
portly	1
sperm	1
whale,	1
that	1
begged	1
a	1
few	1
moments'	1
confidential	1
business	1
with	1
him.	1
That	1
business	1
consisted	1
in	1
fetching	1
the	1
Commodore's	1
craft	1
such	1
a	1
thwack,	1
that	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
pumps	1
going	1
he	1
made	1
straight	1
for	1
the	1
nearest	1
port	1
to	1
heave	1
down	1
and	1
repair.	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
superstitious,	1
but	1
I	1
consider	1
the	1
Commodore's	1
interview	1
with	1
that	1
whale	1
as	1
providential.	1
Was	1
not	1
Saul	1
of	1
Tarsus	1
converted	1
from	1
unbelief	1
by	1
a	1
similar	1
fright?	1
I	1
tell	1
you,	1
the	1
sperm	1
whale	1
will	1
stand	1
no	1
nonsense.	1
I	1
will	1
now	1
refer	1
you	1
to	1
Langsdorff's	1
Voyages	1
for	1
a	1
little	1
circumstance	1
in	1
point,	1
peculiarly	1
interesting	1
to	1
the	1
writer	1
hereof.	1
Langsdorff,	1
you	1
must	1
know	1
by	1
the	1
way,	1
was	1
attached	1
to	1
the	1
Russian	1
Admiral	1
Krusenstern's	1
famous	1
Discovery	1
Expedition	1
in	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
present	1
century.	1
Captain	1
Langsdorff	1
thus	1
begins	1
his	1
seventeenth	1
chapter:	1
"By	1
the	1
thirteenth	1
of	1
May	1
our	1
ship	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
sail,	1
and	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
we	1
were	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
open	1
sea,	1
on	1
our	1
way	1
to	1
Ochotsh.	1
The	1
weather	1
was	1
very	1
clear	1
and	1
fine,	1
but	1
so	1
intolerably	1
cold	1
that	1
we	1
were	1
obliged	1
to	1
keep	1
on	1
our	1
fur	1
clothing.	1
For	1
some	1
days	1
we	1
had	1
very	1
little	1
wind;	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
till	1
the	1
nineteenth	1
that	1
a	1
brisk	1
gale	1
from	1
the	1
northwest	1
sprang	1
up.	1
An	1
uncommon	1
large	1
whale,	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
which	1
was	1
larger	1
than	1
the	1
ship	1
itself,	1
lay	1
almost	1
at	1
the	1
surface	1
of	1
the	1
water,	1
but	1
was	1
not	1
perceived	1
by	1
any	1
one	1
on	1
board	1
till	1
the	1
moment	1
when	1
the	1
ship,	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
full	1
sail,	1
was	1
almost	1
upon	1
him,	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
prevent	1
its	1
striking	1
against	1
him.	1
We	1
were	1
thus	1
placed	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
imminent	1
danger,	1
as	1
this	1
gigantic	1
creature,	1
setting	1
up	1
its	1
back,	1
raised	1
the	1
ship	1
three	1
feet	1
at	1
least	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
water.	1
The	1
masts	1
reeled,	1
and	1
the	1
sails	1
fell	1
altogether,	1
while	1
we	1
who	1
were	1
below	1
all	1
sprang	1
instantly	1
upon	1
the	1
deck,	1
concluding	1
that	1
we	1
had	1
struck	1
upon	1
some	1
rock;	1
instead	1
of	1
this	1
we	1
saw	1
the	1
monster	1
sailing	1
off	1
with	1
the	1
utmost	1
gravity	1
and	1
solemnity.	1
Captain	1
D'Wolf	1
applied	1
immediately	1
to	1
the	1
pumps	1
to	1
examine	1
whether	1
or	1
not	1
the	1
vessel	1
had	1
received	1
any	1
damage	1
from	1
the	1
shock,	1
but	1
we	1
found	1
that	1
very	1
happily	1
it	1
had	1
escaped	1
entirely	1
uninjured."	1
Now,	1
the	1
Captain	1
D'Wolf	1
here	1
alluded	1
to	1
as	1
commanding	1
the	1
ship	1
in	1
question,	1
is	1
a	1
New	1
Englander,	1
who,	1
after	1
a	1
long	1
life	1
of	1
unusual	1
adventures	1
as	1
a	1
sea-captain,	1
this	1
day	1
resides	1
in	1
the	1
village	1
of	1
Dorchester	1
near	1
Boston.	1
I	1
have	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
being	1
a	1
nephew	1
of	1
his.	1
I	1
have	1
particularly	1
questioned	1
him	1
concerning	1
this	1
passage	1
in	1
Langsdorff.	1
He	1
substantiates	1
every	1
word.	1
The	1
ship,	1
however,	1
was	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
a	1
large	1
one:	1
a	1
Russian	1
craft	1
built	1
on	1
the	1
Siberian	1
coast,	1
and	1
purchased	1
by	1
my	1
uncle	1
after	1
bartering	1
away	1
the	1
vessel	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
sailed	1
from	1
home.	1
In	1
that	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
manly	1
book	1
of	1
old-fashioned	1
adventure,	1
so	1
full,	1
too,	1
of	1
honest	1
wonders--the	1
voyage	1
of	1
Lionel	1
Wafer,	1
one	1
of	1
ancient	1
Dampier's	1
old	1
chums--I	1
found	1
a	1
little	1
matter	1
set	1
down	1
so	1
like	1
that	1
just	1
quoted	1
from	1
Langsdorff,	1
that	1
I	1
cannot	1
forbear	1
inserting	1
it	1
here	1
for	1
a	1
corroborative	1
example,	1
if	1
such	1
be	1
needed.	1
Lionel,	1
it	1
seems,	1
was	1
on	1
his	1
way	1
to	1
"John	1
Ferdinando,"	1
as	1
he	1
calls	1
the	1
modern	1
Juan	1
Fernandes.	1
"In	1
our	1
way	1
thither,"	1
he	1
says,	1
"about	1
four	1
o'clock	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
about	1
one	1
hundred	1
and	1
fifty	1
leagues	1
from	1
the	1
Main	1
of	1
America,	1
our	1
ship	1
felt	1
a	1
terrible	1
shock,	1
which	1
put	1
our	1
men	1
in	1
such	1
consternation	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
hardly	1
tell	1
where	1
they	1
were	1
or	1
what	1
to	1
think;	1
but	1
every	1
one	1
began	1
to	1
prepare	1
for	1
death.	1
And,	1
indeed,	1
the	1
shock	1
was	1
so	1
sudden	1
and	1
violent,	1
that	1
we	1
took	1
it	1
for	1
granted	1
the	1
ship	1
had	1
struck	1
against	1
a	1
rock;	1
but	1
when	1
the	1
amazement	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
over,	1
we	1
cast	1
the	1
lead,	1
and	1
sounded,	1
but	1
found	1
no	1
ground.	1
....	1
The	1
suddenness	1
of	1
the	1
shock	1
made	1
the	1
guns	1
leap	1
in	1
their	1
carriages,	1
and	1
several	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
were	1
shaken	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
hammocks.	1
Captain	1
Davis,	1
who	1
lay	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
on	1
a	1
gun,	1
was	1
thrown	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
cabin!"	1
Lionel	1
then	1
goes	1
on	1
to	1
impute	1
the	1
shock	1
to	1
an	1
earthquake,	1
and	1
seems	1
to	1
substantiate	1
the	1
imputation	1
by	1
stating	1
that	1
a	1
great	1
earthquake,	1
somewhere	1
about	1
that	1
time,	1
did	1
actually	1
do	1
great	1
mischief	1
along	1
the	1
Spanish	1
land.	1
But	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
much	1
wonder	1
if,	1
in	1
the	1
darkness	1
of	1
that	1
early	1
hour	1
of	1
the	1
morning,	1
the	1
shock	1
was	1
after	1
all	1
caused	1
by	1
an	1
unseen	1
whale	1
vertically	1
bumping	1
the	1
hull	1
from	1
beneath.	1
I	1
might	1
proceed	1
with	1
several	1
more	1
examples,	1
one	1
way	1
or	1
another	1
known	1
to	1
me,	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
power	1
and	1
malice	1
at	1
times	1
of	1
the	1
sperm	1
whale.	1
In	1
more	1
than	1
one	1
instance,	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
known,	1
not	1
only	1
to	1
chase	1
the	1
assailing	1
boats	1
back	1
to	1
their	1
ships,	1
but	1
to	1
pursue	1
the	1
ship	1
itself,	1
and	1
long	1
withstand	1
all	1
the	1
lances	1
hurled	1
at	1
him	1
from	1
its	1
decks.	1
The	1
English	1
ship	1
Pusie	1
Hall	1
can	1
tell	1
a	1
story	1
on	1
that	1
head;	1
and,	1
as	1
for	1
his	1
strength,	1
let	1
me	1
say,	1
that	1
there	1
have	1
been	1
examples	1
where	1
the	1
lines	1
attached	1
to	1
a	1
running	1
sperm	1
whale	1
have,	1
in	1
a	1
calm,	1
been	1
transferred	1
to	1
the	1
ship,	1
and	1
secured	1
there;	1
the	1
whale	1
towing	1
her	1
great	1
hull	1
through	1
the	1
water,	1
as	1
a	1
horse	1
walks	1
off	1
with	1
a	1
cart.	1
Again,	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
often	1
observed	1
that,	1
if	1
the	1
sperm	1
whale,	1
once	1
struck,	1
is	1
allowed	1
time	1
to	1
rally,	1
he	1
then	1
acts,	1
not	1
so	1
often	1
with	1
blind	1
rage,	1
as	1
with	1
wilful,	1
deliberate	1
designs	1
of	1
destruction	1
to	1
his	1
pursuers;	1
nor	1
is	1
it	1
without	1
conveying	1
some	1
eloquent	1
indication	1
of	1
his	1
character,	1
that	1
upon	1
being	1
attacked	1
he	1
will	1
frequently	1
open	1
his	1
mouth,	1
and	1
retain	1
it	1
in	1
that	1
dread	1
expansion	1
for	1
several	1
consecutive	1
minutes.	1
But	1
I	1
must	1
be	1
content	1
with	1
only	1
one	1
more	1
and	1
a	1
concluding	1
illustration;	1
a	1
remarkable	1
and	1
most	1
significant	1
one,	1
by	1
which	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
fail	1
to	1
see,	1
that	1
not	1
only	1
is	1
the	1
most	1
marvellous	1
event	1
in	1
this	1
book	1
corroborated	1
by	1
plain	1
facts	1
of	1
the	1
present	1
day,	1
but	1
that	1
these	1
marvels	1
(like	1
all	1
marvels)	1
are	1
mere	1
repetitions	1
of	1
the	1
ages;	1
so	1
that	1
for	1
the	1
millionth	1
time	1
we	1
say	1
amen	1
with	1
Solomon--Verily	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
new	1
under	1
the	1
sun.	1
In	1
the	1
sixth	1
Christian	1
century	1
lived	1
Procopius,	1
a	1
Christian	1
magistrate	1
of	1
Constantinople,	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
when	1
Justinian	1
was	1
Emperor	1
and	1
Belisarius	1
general.	1
As	1
many	1
know,	1
he	1
wrote	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
times,	1
a	1
work	1
every	1
way	1
of	1
uncommon	1
value.	1
By	1
the	1
best	1
authorities,	1
he	1
has	1
always	1
been	1
considered	1
a	1
most	1
trustworthy	1
and	1
unexaggerating	1
historian,	1
except	1
in	1
some	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
particulars,	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
affecting	1
the	1
matter	1
presently	1
to	1
be	1
mentioned.	1
Now,	1
in	1
this	1
history	1
of	1
his,	1
Procopius	1
mentions	1
that,	1
during	1
the	1
term	1
of	1
his	1
prefecture	1
at	1
Constantinople,	1
a	1
great	1
sea-monster	1
was	1
captured	1
in	1
the	1
neighboring	1
Propontis,	1
or	1
Sea	1
of	1
Marmora,	1
after	1
having	1
destroyed	1
vessels	1
at	1
intervals	1
in	1
those	1
waters	1
for	1
a	1
period	1
of	1
more	1
than	1
fifty	1
years.	1
A	1
fact	1
thus	1
set	1
down	1
in	1
substantial	1
history	1
cannot	1
easily	1
be	1
gainsaid.	1
Nor	1
is	1
there	1
any	1
reason	1
it	1
should	1
be.	1
Of	1
what	1
precise	1
species	1
this	1
sea-monster	1
was,	1
is	1
not	1
mentioned.	1
But	1
as	1
he	1
destroyed	1
ships,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
for	1
other	1
reasons,	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
whale;	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
strongly	1
inclined	1
to	1
think	1
a	1
sperm	1
whale.	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
you	1
why.	1
For	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
I	1
fancied	1
that	1
the	1
sperm	1
whale	1
had	1
been	1
always	1
unknown	1
in	1
the	1
Mediterranean	1
and	1
the	1
deep	1
waters	1
connecting	1
with	1
it.	1
Even	1
now	1
I	1
am	1
certain	1
that	1
those	1
seas	1
are	1
not,	1
and	1
perhaps	1
never	1
can	1
be,	1
in	1
the	1
present	1
constitution	1
of	1
things,	1
a	1
place	1
for	1
his	1
habitual	1
gregarious	1
resort.	1
But	1
further	1
investigations	1
have	1
recently	1
proved	1
to	1
me,	1
that	1
in	1
modern	1
times	1
there	1
have	1
been	1
isolated	1
instances	1
of	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
sperm	1
whale	1
in	1
the	1
Mediterranean.	1
I	1
am	1
told,	1
on	1
good	1
authority,	1
that	1
on	1
the	1
Barbary	1
coast,	1
a	1
Commodore	1
Davis	1
of	1
the	1
British	1
navy	1
found	1
the	1
skeleton	1
of	1
a	1
sperm	1
whale.	1
Now,	1
as	1
a	1
vessel	1
of	1
war	1
readily	1
passes	1
through	1
the	1
Dardanelles,	1
hence	1
a	1
sperm	1
whale	1
could,	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
route,	1
pass	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
Mediterranean	1
into	1
the	1
Propontis.	1
In	1
the	1
Propontis,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
I	1
can	1
learn,	1
none	1
of	1
that	1
peculiar	1
substance	1
called	1
BRIT	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
found,	1
the	1
aliment	1
of	1
the	1
right	1
whale.	1
But	1
I	1
have	1
every	1
reason	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
the	1
food	1
of	1
the	1
sperm	1
whale--squid	1
or	1
cuttle-fish--lurks	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
that	1
sea,	1
because	1
large	1
creatures,	1
but	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
the	1
largest	1
of	1
that	1
sort,	1
have	1
been	1
found	1
at	1
its	1
surface.	1
If,	1
then,	1
you	1
properly	1
put	1
these	1
statements	1
together,	1
and	1
reason	1
upon	1
them	1
a	1
bit,	1
you	1
will	1
clearly	1
perceive	1
that,	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
human	1
reasoning,	1
Procopius's	1
sea-monster,	1
that	1
for	1
half	1
a	1
century	1
stove	1
the	1
ships	1
of	1
a	1
Roman	1
Emperor,	1
must	1
in	1
all	1
probability	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
sperm	1
whale.	1
CHAPTER	1
46	1
Surmises.	1
Though,	1
consumed	1
with	1
the	1
hot	1
fire	1
of	1
his	1
purpose,	1
Ahab	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
thoughts	1
and	1
actions	1
ever	1
had	1
in	1
view	1
the	1
ultimate	1
capture	1
of	1
Moby	1
Dick;	1
though	1
he	1
seemed	1
ready	1
to	1
sacrifice	1
all	1
mortal	1
interests	1
to	1
that	1
one	1
passion;	1
nevertheless	1
it	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
by	1
nature	1
and	1
long	1
habituation	1
far	1
too	1
wedded	1
to	1
a	1
fiery	1
whaleman's	1
ways,	1
altogether	1
to	1
abandon	1
the	1
collateral	1
prosecution	1
of	1
the	1
voyage.	1
Or	1
at	1
least	1
if	1
this	1
were	1
otherwise,	1
there	1
were	1
not	1
wanting	1
other	1
motives	1
much	1
more	1
influential	1
with	1
him.	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
refining	1
too	1
much,	1
perhaps,	1
even	1
considering	1
his	1
monomania,	1
to	1
hint	1
that	1
his	1
vindictiveness	1
towards	1
the	1
White	1
Whale	1
might	1
have	1
possibly	1
extended	1
itself	1
in	1
some	1
degree	1
to	1
all	1
sperm	1
whales,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
more	1
monsters	1
he	1
slew	1
by	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
more	1
he	1
multiplied	1
the	1
chances	1
that	1
each	1
subsequently	1
encountered	1
whale	1
would	1
prove	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
hated	1
one	1
he	1
hunted.	1
But	1
if	1
such	1
an	1
hypothesis	1
be	1
indeed	1
exceptionable,	1
there	1
were	1
still	1
additional	1
considerations	1
which,	1
though	1
not	1
so	1
strictly	1
according	1
with	1
the	1
wildness	1
of	1
his	1
ruling	1
passion,	1
yet	1
were	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
incapable	1
of	1
swaying	1
him.	1
To	1
accomplish	1
his	1
object	1
Ahab	1
must	1
use	1
tools;	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
tools	1
used	1
in	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
the	1
moon,	1
men	1
are	1
most	1
apt	1
to	1
get	1
out	1
of	1
order.	1
He	1
knew,	1
for	1
example,	1
that	1
however	1
magnetic	1
his	1
ascendency	1
in	1
some	1
respects	1
was	1
over	1
Starbuck,	1
yet	1
that	1
ascendency	1
did	1
not	1
cover	1
the	1
complete	1
spiritual	1
man	1
any	1
more	1
than	1
mere	1
corporeal	1
superiority	1
involves	1
intellectual	1
mastership;	1
for	1
to	1
the	1
purely	1
spiritual,	1
the	1
intellectual	1
but	1
stand	1
in	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
corporeal	1
relation.	1
Starbuck's	1
body	1
and	1
Starbuck's	1
coerced	1
will	1
were	1
Ahab's,	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
Ahab	1
kept	1
his	1
magnet	1
at	1
Starbuck's	1
brain;	1
still	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
for	1
all	1
this	1
the	1
chief	1
mate,	1
in	1
his	1
soul,	1
abhorred	1
his	1
captain's	1
quest,	1
and	1
could	1
he,	1
would	1
joyfully	1
disintegrate	1
himself	1
from	1
it,	1
or	1
even	1
frustrate	1
it.	1
It	1
might	1
be	1
that	1
a	1
long	1
interval	1
would	1
elapse	1
ere	1
the	1
White	1
Whale	1
was	1
seen.	1
During	1
that	1
long	1
interval	1
Starbuck	1
would	1
ever	1
be	1
apt	1
to	1
fall	1
into	1
open	1
relapses	1
of	1
rebellion	1
against	1
his	1
captain's	1
leadership,	1
unless	1
some	1
ordinary,	1
prudential,	1
circumstantial	1
influences	1
were	1
brought	1
to	1
bear	1
upon	1
him.	1
Not	1
only	1
that,	1
but	1
the	1
subtle	1
insanity	1
of	1
Ahab	1
respecting	1
Moby	1
Dick	1
was	1
noways	1
more	1
significantly	1
manifested	1
than	1
in	1
his	1
superlative	1
sense	1
and	1
shrewdness	1
in	1
foreseeing	1
that,	1
for	1
the	1
present,	1
the	1
hunt	1
should	1
in	1
some	1
way	1
be	1
stripped	1
of	1
that	1
strange	1
imaginative	1
impiousness	1
which	1
naturally	1
invested	1
it;	1
that	1
the	1
full	1
terror	1
of	1
the	1
voyage	1
must	1
be	1
kept	1
withdrawn	1
into	1
the	1
obscure	1
background	1
(for	1
few	1
men's	1
courage	1
is	1
proof	1
against	1
protracted	1
meditation	1
unrelieved	1
by	1
action);	1
that	1
when	1
they	1
stood	1
their	1
long	1
night	1
watches,	1
his	1
officers	1
and	1
men	1
must	1
have	1
some	1
nearer	1
things	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
than	1
Moby	1
Dick.	1
For	1
however	1
eagerly	1
and	1
impetuously	1
the	1
savage	1
crew	1
had	1
hailed	1
the	1
announcement	1
of	1
his	1
quest;	1
yet	1
all	1
sailors	1
of	1
all	1
sorts	1
are	1
more	1
or	1
less	1
capricious	1
and	1
unreliable--they	1
live	1
in	1
the	1
varying	1
outer	1
weather,	1
and	1
they	1
inhale	1
its	1
fickleness--and	1
when	1
retained	1
for	1
any	1
object	1
remote	1
and	1
blank	1
in	1
the	1
pursuit,	1
however	1
promissory	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
passion	1
in	1
the	1
end,	1
it	1
is	1
above	1
all	1
things	1
requisite	1
that	1
temporary	1
interests	1
and	1
employments	1
should	1
intervene	1
and	1
hold	1
them	1
healthily	1
suspended	1
for	1
the	1
final	1
dash.	1
Nor	1
was	1
Ahab	1
unmindful	1
of	1
another	1
thing.	1
In	1
times	1
of	1
strong	1
emotion	1
mankind	1
disdain	1
all	1
base	1
considerations;	1
but	1
such	1
times	1
are	1
evanescent.	1
The	1
permanent	1
constitutional	1
condition	1
of	1
the	1
manufactured	1
man,	1
thought	1
Ahab,	1
is	1
sordidness.	1
Granting	1
that	1
the	1
White	1
Whale	1
fully	1
incites	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
this	1
my	1
savage	1
crew,	1
and	1
playing	1
round	1
their	1
savageness	1
even	1
breeds	1
a	1
certain	1
generous	1
knight-errantism	1
in	1
them,	1
still,	1
while	1
for	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
it	1
they	1
give	1
chase	1
to	1
Moby	1
Dick,	1
they	1
must	1
also	1
have	1
food	1
for	1
their	1
more	1
common,	1
daily	1
appetites.	1
For	1
even	1
the	1
high	1
lifted	1
and	1
chivalric	1
Crusaders	1
of	1
old	1
times	1
were	1
not	1
content	1
to	1
traverse	1
two	1
thousand	1
miles	1
of	1
land	1
to	1
fight	1
for	1
their	1
holy	1
sepulchre,	1
without	1
committing	1
burglaries,	1
picking	1
pockets,	1
and	1
gaining	1
other	1
pious	1
perquisites	1
by	1
the	1
way.	1
Had	1
they	1
been	1
strictly	1
held	1
to	1
their	1
one	1
final	1
and	1
romantic	1
object--that	1
final	1
and	1
romantic	1
object,	1
too	1
many	1
would	1
have	1
turned	1
from	1
in	1
disgust.	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
strip	1
these	1
men,	1
thought	1
Ahab,	1
of	1
all	1
hopes	1
of	1
cash--aye,	1
cash.	1
They	1
may	1
scorn	1
cash	1
now;	1
but	1
let	1
some	1
months	1
go	1
by,	1
and	1
no	1
perspective	1
promise	1
of	1
it	1
to	1
them,	1
and	1
then	1
this	1
same	1
quiescent	1
cash	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
mutinying	1
in	1
them,	1
this	1
same	1
cash	1
would	1
soon	1
cashier	1
Ahab.	1
Nor	1
was	1
there	1
wanting	1
still	1
another	1
precautionary	1
motive	1
more	1
related	1
to	1
Ahab	1
personally.	1
Having	1
impulsively,	1
it	1
is	1
probable,	1
and	1
perhaps	1
somewhat	1
prematurely	1
revealed	1
the	1
prime	1
but	1
private	1
purpose	1
of	1
the	1
Pequod's	1
voyage,	1
Ahab	1
was	1
now	1
entirely	1
conscious	1
that,	1
in	1
so	1
doing,	1
he	1
had	1
indirectly	1
laid	1
himself	1
open	1
to	1
the	1
unanswerable	1
charge	1
of	1
usurpation;	1
and	1
with	1
perfect	1
impunity,	1
both	1
moral	1
and	1
legal,	1
his	1
crew	1
if	1
so	1
disposed,	1
and	1
to	1
that	1
end	1
competent,	1
could	1
refuse	1
all	1
further	1
obedience	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
even	1
violently	1
wrest	1
from	1
him	1
the	1
command.	1
From	1
even	1
the	1
barely	1
hinted	1
imputation	1
of	1
usurpation,	1
and	1
the	1
possible	1
consequences	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
suppressed	1
impression	1
gaining	1
ground,	1
Ahab	1
must	1
of	1
course	1
have	1
been	1
most	1
anxious	1
to	1
protect	1
himself.	1
That	1
protection	1
could	1
only	1
consist	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
predominating	1
brain	1
and	1
heart	1
and	1
hand,	1
backed	1
by	1
a	1
heedful,	1
closely	1
calculating	1
attention	1
to	1
every	1
minute	1
atmospheric	1
influence	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
possible	1
for	1
his	1
crew	1
to	1
be	1
subjected	1
to.	1
For	1
all	1
these	1
reasons	1
then,	1
and	1
others	1
perhaps	1
too	1
analytic	1
to	1
be	1
verbally	1
developed	1
here,	1
Ahab	1
plainly	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
still	1
in	1
a	1
good	1
degree	1
continue	1
true	1
to	1
the	1
natural,	1
nominal	1
purpose	1
of	1
the	1
Pequod's	1
voyage;	1
observe	1
all	1
customary	1
usages;	1
and	1
not	1
only	1
that,	1
but	1
force	1
himself	1
to	1
evince	1
all	1
his	1
well	1
known	1
passionate	1
interest	1
in	1
the	1
general	1
pursuit	1
of	1
his	1
profession.	1
Be	1
all	1
this	1
as	1
it	1
may,	1
his	1
voice	1
was	1
now	1
often	1
heard	1
hailing	1
the	1
three	1
mast-heads	1
and	1
admonishing	1
them	1
to	1
keep	1
a	1
bright	1
look-out,	1
and	1
not	1
omit	1
reporting	1
even	1
a	1
porpoise.	1
This	1
vigilance	1
was	1
not	1
long	1
without	1
reward.	1
CHAPTER	1
47	1
The	1
Mat-Maker.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
cloudy,	1
sultry	1
afternoon;	1
the	1
seamen	1
were	1
lazily	1
lounging	1
about	1
the	1
decks,	1
or	1
vacantly	1
gazing	1
over	1
into	1
the	1
lead-coloured	1
waters.	1
Queequeg	1
and	1
I	1
were	1
mildly	1
employed	1
weaving	1
what	1
is	1
called	1
a	1
sword-mat,	1
for	1
an	1
additional	1
lashing	1
to	1
our	1
boat.	1
So	1
still	1
and	1
subdued	1
and	1
yet	1
somehow	1
preluding	1
was	1
all	1
the	1
scene,	1
and	1
such	1
an	1
incantation	1
of	1
reverie	1
lurked	1
in	1
the	1
air,	1
that	1
each	1
silent	1
sailor	1
seemed	1
resolved	1
into	1
his	1
own	1
invisible	1
self.	1
I	1
was	1
the	1
attendant	1
or	1
page	1
of	1
Queequeg,	1
while	1
busy	1
at	1
the	1
mat.	1
As	1
I	1
kept	1
passing	1
and	1
repassing	1
the	1
filling	1
or	1
woof	1
of	1
marline	1
between	1
the	1
long	1
yarns	1
of	1
the	1
warp,	1
using	1
my	1
own	1
hand	1
for	1
the	1
shuttle,	1
and	1
as	1
Queequeg,	1
standing	1
sideways,	1
ever	1
and	1
anon	1
slid	1
his	1
heavy	1
oaken	1
sword	1
between	1
the	1
threads,	1
and	1
idly	1
looking	1
off	1
upon	1
the	1
water,	1
carelessly	1
and	1
unthinkingly	1
drove	1
home	1
every	1
yarn:	1
I	1
say	1
so	1
strange	1
a	1
dreaminess	1
did	1
there	1
then	1
reign	1
all	1
over	1
the	1
ship	1
and	1
all	1
over	1
the	1
sea,	1
only	1
broken	1
by	1
the	1
intermitting	1
dull	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
sword,	1
that	1
it	1
seemed	1
as	1
if	1
this	1
were	1
the	1
Loom	1
of	1
Time,	1
and	1
I	1
myself	1
were	1
a	1
shuttle	1
mechanically	1
weaving	1
and	1
weaving	1
away	1
at	1
the	1
Fates.	1
There	1
lay	1
the	1
fixed	1
threads	1
of	1
the	1
warp	1
subject	1
to	1
but	1
one	1
single,	1
ever	1
returning,	1
unchanging	1
vibration,	1
and	1
that	1
vibration	1
merely	1
enough	1
to	1
admit	1
of	1
the	1
crosswise	1
interblending	1
of	1
other	1
threads	1
with	1
its	1
own.	1
This	1
warp	1
seemed	1
necessity;	1
and	1
here,	1
thought	1
I,	1
with	1
my	1
own	1
hand	1
I	1
ply	1
my	1
own	1
shuttle	1
and	1
weave	1
my	1
own	1
destiny	1
into	1
these	1
unalterable	1
threads.	1
Meantime,	1
Queequeg's	1
impulsive,	1
indifferent	1
sword,	1
sometimes	1
hitting	1
the	1
woof	1
slantingly,	1
or	1
crookedly,	1
or	1
strongly,	1
or	1
weakly,	1
as	1
the	1
case	1
might	1
be;	1
and	1
by	1
this	1
difference	1
in	1
the	1
concluding	1
blow	1
producing	1
a	1
corresponding	1
contrast	1
in	1
the	1
final	1
aspect	1
of	1
the	1
completed	1
fabric;	1
this	1
savage's	1
sword,	1
thought	1
I,	1
which	1
thus	1
finally	1
shapes	1
and	1
fashions	1
both	1
warp	1
and	1
woof;	1
this	1
easy,	1
indifferent	1
sword	1
must	1
be	1
chance--aye,	1
chance,	1
free	1
will,	1
and	1
necessity--nowise	1
incompatible--all	1
interweavingly	1
working	1
together.	1
The	1
straight	1
warp	1
of	1
necessity,	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
swerved	1
from	1
its	1
ultimate	1
course--its	1
every	1
alternating	1
vibration,	1
indeed,	1
only	1
tending	1
to	1
that;	1
free	1
will	1
still	1
free	1
to	1
ply	1
her	1
shuttle	1
between	1
given	1
threads;	1
and	1
chance,	1
though	1
restrained	1
in	1
its	1
play	1
within	1
the	1
right	1
lines	1
of	1
necessity,	1
and	1
sideways	1
in	1
its	1
motions	1
directed	1
by	1
free	1
will,	1
though	1
thus	1
prescribed	1
to	1
by	1
both,	1
chance	1
by	1
turns	1
rules	1
either,	1
and	1
has	1
the	1
last	1
featuring	1
blow	1
at	1
events.	1
Thus	1
we	1
were	1
weaving	1
and	1
weaving	1
away	1
when	1
I	1
started	1
at	1
a	1
sound	1
so	1
strange,	1
long	1
drawn,	1
and	1
musically	1
wild	1
and	1
unearthly,	1
that	1
the	1
ball	1
of	1
free	1
will	1
dropped	1
from	1
my	1
hand,	1
and	1
I	1
stood	1
gazing	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
clouds	1
whence	1
that	1
voice	1
dropped	1
like	1
a	1
wing.	1
High	1
aloft	1
in	1
the	1
cross-trees	1
was	1
that	1
mad	1
Gay-Header,	1
Tashtego.	1
His	1
body	1
was	1
reaching	1
eagerly	1
forward,	1
his	1
hand	1
stretched	1
out	1
like	1
a	1
wand,	1
and	1
at	1
brief	1
sudden	1
intervals	1
he	1
continued	1
his	1
cries.	1
To	1
be	1
sure	1
the	1
same	1
sound	1
was	1
that	1
very	1
moment	1
perhaps	1
being	1
heard	1
all	1
over	1
the	1
seas,	1
from	1
hundreds	1
of	1
whalemen's	1
look-outs	1
perched	1
as	1
high	1
in	1
the	1
air;	1
but	1
from	1
few	1
of	1
those	1
lungs	1
could	1
that	1
accustomed	1
old	1
cry	1
have	1
derived	1
such	1
a	1
marvellous	1
cadence	1
as	1
from	1
Tashtego	1
the	1
Indian's.	1
As	1
he	1
stood	1
hovering	1
over	1
you	1
half	1
suspended	1
in	1
air,	1
so	1
wildly	1
and	1
eagerly	1
peering	1
towards	1
the	1
horizon,	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
thought	1
him	1
some	1
prophet	1
or	1
seer	1
beholding	1
the	1
shadows	1
of	1
Fate,	1
and	1
by	1
those	1
wild	1
cries	1
announcing	1
their	1
coming.	1
"There	1
she	1
blows!	1
there!	1
there!	1
there!	1
she	1
blows!	1
she	1
blows!"	1
"Where-away?"	1
"On	1
the	1
lee-beam,	1
about	1
two	1
miles	1
off!	1
a	1
school	1
of	1
them!"	1
Instantly	1
all	1
was	1
commotion.	1
The	1
Sperm	1
Whale	1
blows	1
as	1
a	1
clock	1
ticks,	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
undeviating	1
and	1
reliable	1
uniformity.	1
And	1
thereby	1
whalemen	1
distinguish	1
this	1
fish	1
from	1
other	1
tribes	1
of	1
his	1
genus.	1
"There	1
go	1
flukes!"	1
was	1
now	1
the	1
cry	1
from	1
Tashtego;	1
and	1
the	1
whales	1
disappeared.	1
"Quick,	1
steward!"	1
cried	1
Ahab.	1
"Time!	1
time!"	1
Dough-Boy	1
hurried	1
below,	1
glanced	1
at	1
the	1
watch,	1
and	1
reported	1
the	1
exact	1
minute	1
to	1
Ahab.	1
The	1
ship	1
was	1
now	1
kept	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
wind,	1
and	1
she	1
went	1
gently	1
rolling	1
before	1
it.	1
Tashtego	1
reporting	1
that	1
the	1
whales	1
had	1
gone	1
down	1
heading	1
to	1
leeward,	1
we	1
confidently	1
looked	1
to	1
see	1
them	1
again	1
directly	1
in	1
advance	1
of	1
our	1
bows.	1
For	1
that	1
singular	1
craft	1
at	1
times	1
evinced	1
by	1
the	1
Sperm	1
Whale	1
when,	1
sounding	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
in	1
one	1
direction,	1
he	1
nevertheless,	1
while	1
concealed	1
beneath	1
the	1
surface,	1
mills	1
round,	1
and	1
swiftly	1
swims	1
off	1
in	1
the	1
opposite	1
quarter--this	1
deceitfulness	1
of	1
his	1
could	1
not	1
now	1
be	1
in	1
action;	1
for	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
reason	1
to	1
suppose	1
that	1
the	1
fish	1
seen	1
by	1
Tashtego	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
any	1
way	1
alarmed,	1
or	1
indeed	1
knew	1
at	1
all	1
of	1
our	1
vicinity.	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
selected	1
for	1
shipkeepers--that	1
is,	1
those	1
not	1
appointed	1
to	1
the	1
boats,	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
relieved	1
the	1
Indian	1
at	1
the	1
main-mast	1
head.	1
The	1
sailors	1
at	1
the	1
fore	1
and	1
mizzen	1
had	1
come	1
down;	1
the	1
line	1
tubs	1
were	1
fixed	1
in	1
their	1
places;	1
the	1
cranes	1
were	1
thrust	1
out;	1
the	1
mainyard	1
was	1
backed,	1
and	1
the	1
three	1
boats	1
swung	1
over	1
the	1
sea	1
like	1
three	1
samphire	1
baskets	1
over	1
high	1
cliffs.	1
Outside	1
of	1
the	1
bulwarks	1
their	1
eager	1
crews	1
with	1
one	1
hand	1
clung	1
to	1
the	1
rail,	1
while	1
one	1
foot	1
was	1
expectantly	1
poised	1
on	1
the	1
gunwale.	1
So	1
look	1
the	1
long	1
line	1
of	1
man-of-war's	1
men	1
about	1
to	1
throw	1
themselves	1
on	1
board	1
an	1
enemy's	1
ship.	1
But	1
at	1
this	1
critical	1
instant	1
a	1
sudden	1
exclamation	1
was	1
heard	1
that	1
took	1
every	1
eye	1
from	1
the	1
whale.	1
With	1
a	1
start	1
all	1
glared	1
at	1
dark	1
Ahab,	1
who	1
was	1
surrounded	1
by	1
five	1
dusky	1
phantoms	1
that	1
seemed	1
fresh	1
formed	1
out	1
of	1
air.	1
CHAPTER	1
48	1
The	1
First	1
Lowering.	1
The	1
phantoms,	1
for	1
so	1
they	1
then	1
seemed,	1
were	1
flitting	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
deck,	1
and,	1
with	1
a	1
noiseless	1
celerity,	1
were	1
casting	1
loose	1
the	1
tackles	1
and	1
bands	1
of	1
the	1
boat	1
which	1
swung	1
there.	1
This	1
boat	1
had	1
always	1
been	1
deemed	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
spare	1
boats,	1
though	1
technically	1
called	1
the	1
captain's,	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
its	1
hanging	1
from	1
the	1
starboard	1
quarter.	1
The	1
figure	1
that	1
now	1
stood	1
by	1
its	1
bows	1
was	1
tall	1
and	1
swart,	1
with	1
one	1
white	1
tooth	1
evilly	1
protruding	1
from	1
its	1
steel-like	1
lips.	1
A	1
rumpled	1
Chinese	1
jacket	1
of	1
black	1
cotton	1
funereally	1
invested	1
him,	1
with	1
wide	1
black	1
trowsers	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
dark	1
stuff.	1
But	1
strangely	1
crowning	1
this	1
ebonness	1
was	1
a	1
glistening	1
white	1
plaited	1
turban,	1
the	1
living	1
hair	1
braided	1
and	1
coiled	1
round	1
and	1
round	1
upon	1
his	1
head.	1
Less	1
swart	1
in	1
aspect,	1
the	1
companions	1
of	1
this	1
figure	1
were	1
of	1
that	1
vivid,	1
tiger-yellow	1
complexion	1
peculiar	1
to	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
aboriginal	1
natives	1
of	1
the	1
Manillas;--a	1
race	1
notorious	1
for	1
a	1
certain	1
diabolism	1
of	1
subtilty,	1
and	1
by	1
some	1
honest	1
white	1
mariners	1
supposed	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
paid	1
spies	1
and	1
secret	1
confidential	1
agents	1
on	1
the	1
water	1
of	1
the	1
devil,	1
their	1
lord,	1
whose	1
counting-room	1
they	1
suppose	1
to	1
be	1
elsewhere.	1
While	1
yet	1
the	1
wondering	1
ship's	1
company	1
were	1
gazing	1
upon	1
these	1
strangers,	1
Ahab	1
cried	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
white-turbaned	1
old	1
man	1
at	1
their	1
head,	1
"All	1
ready	1
there,	1
Fedallah?"	1
"Ready,"	1
was	1
the	1
half-hissed	1
reply.	1
"Lower	1
away	1
then;	1
d'ye	1
hear?"	1
shouting	1
across	1
the	1
deck.	1
"Lower	1
away	1
there,	1
I	1
say."	1
Such	1
was	1
the	1
thunder	1
of	1
his	1
voice,	1
that	1
spite	1
of	1
their	1
amazement	1
the	1
men	1
sprang	1
over	1
the	1
rail;	1
the	1
sheaves	1
whirled	1
round	1
in	1
the	1
blocks;	1
with	1
a	1
wallow,	1
the	1
three	1
boats	1
dropped	1
into	1
the	1
sea;	1
while,	1
with	1
a	1
dexterous,	1
off-handed	1
daring,	1
unknown	1
in	1
any	1
other	1
vocation,	1
the	1
sailors,	1
goat-like,	1
leaped	1
down	1
the	1
rolling	1
ship's	1
side	1
into	1
the	1
tossed	1
boats	1
below.	1
Hardly	1
had	1
they	1
pulled	1
out	1
from	1
under	1
the	1
ship's	1
lee,	1
when	1
a	1
fourth	1
keel,	1
coming	1
from	1
the	1
windward	1
side,	1
pulled	1
round	1
under	1
the	1
stern,	1
and	1
showed	1
the	1
five	1
strangers	1
rowing	1
Ahab,	1
who,	1
standing	1
erect	1
in	1
the	1
stern,	1
loudly	1
hailed	1
Starbuck,	1
Stubb,	1
and	1
Flask,	1
to	1
spread	1
themselves	1
widely,	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
cover	1
a	1
large	1
expanse	1
of	1
water.	1
But	1
with	1
all	1
their	1
eyes	1
again	1
riveted	1
upon	1
the	1
swart	1
Fedallah	1
and	1
his	1
crew,	1
the	1
inmates	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
boats	1
obeyed	1
not	1
the	1
command.	1
"Captain	1
Ahab?--"	1
said	1
Starbuck.	1
"Spread	1
yourselves,"	1
cried	1
Ahab;	1
"give	1
way,	1
all	1
four	1
boats.	1
Thou,	1
Flask,	1
pull	1
out	1
more	1
to	1
leeward!"	1
"Aye,	1
aye,	1
sir,"	1
cheerily	1
cried	1
little	1
King-Post,	1
sweeping	1
round	1
his	1
great	1
steering	1
oar.	1
"Lay	1
back!"	1
addressing	1
his	1
crew.	1
"There!--there!--there	1
again!	1
There	1
she	1
blows	1
right	1
ahead,	1
boys!--lay	1
back!"	1
"Never	1
heed	1
yonder	1
yellow	1
boys,	1
Archy."	1
"Oh,	1
I	1
don't	1
mind'em,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
Archy;	1
"I	1
knew	1
it	1
all	1
before	1
now.	1
Didn't	1
I	1
hear	1
'em	1
in	1
the	1
hold?	1
And	1
didn't	1
I	1
tell	1
Cabaco	1
here	1
of	1
it?	1
What	1
say	1
ye,	1
Cabaco?	1
They	1
are	1
stowaways,	1
Mr.	1
Flask."	1
"Pull,	1
pull,	1
my	1
fine	1
hearts-alive;	1
pull,	1
my	1
children;	1
pull,	1
my	1
little	1
ones,"	1
drawlingly	1
and	1
soothingly	1
sighed	1
Stubb	1
to	1
his	1
crew,	1
some	1
of	1
whom	1
still	1
showed	1
signs	1
of	1
uneasiness.	1
"Why	1
don't	1
you	1
break	1
your	1
backbones,	1
my	1
boys?	1
What	1
is	1
it	1
you	1
stare	1
at?	1
Those	1
chaps	1
in	1
yonder	1
boat?	1
Tut!	1
They	1
are	1
only	1
five	1
more	1
hands	1
come	1
to	1
help	1
us--never	1
mind	1
from	1
where--the	1
more	1
the	1
merrier.	1
Pull,	1
then,	1
do	1
pull;	1
never	1
mind	1
the	1
brimstone--devils	1
are	1
good	1
fellows	1
enough.	1
So,	1
so;	1
there	1
you	1
are	1
now;	1
that's	1
the	1
stroke	1
for	1
a	1
thousand	1
pounds;	1
that's	1
the	1
stroke	1
to	1
sweep	1
the	1
stakes!	1
Hurrah	1
for	1
the	1
gold	1
cup	1
of	1
sperm	1
oil,	1
my	1
heroes!	1
Three	1
cheers,	1
men--all	1
hearts	1
alive!	1
Easy,	1
easy;	1
don't	1
be	1
in	1
a	1
hurry--don't	1
be	1
in	1
a	1
hurry.	1
Why	1
don't	1
you	1
snap	1
your	1
oars,	1
you	1
rascals?	1
Bite	1
something,	1
you	1
dogs!	1
So,	1
so,	1
so,	1
then:--softly,	1
softly!	1
That's	1
it--that's	1
it!	1
long	1
and	1
strong.	1
Give	1
way	1
there,	1
give	1
way!	1
The	1
devil	1
fetch	1
ye,	1
ye	1
ragamuffin	1
rapscallions;	1
ye	1
are	1
all	1
asleep.	1
Stop	1
snoring,	1
ye	1
sleepers,	1
and	1
pull.	1
Pull,	1
will	1
ye?	1
pull,	1
can't	1
ye?	1
pull,	1
won't	1
ye?	1
Why	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
gudgeons	1
and	1
ginger-cakes	1
don't	1
ye	1
pull?--pull	1
and	1
break	1
something!	1
pull,	1
and	1
start	1
your	1
eyes	1
out!	1
Here!"	1
whipping	1
out	1
the	1
sharp	1
knife	1
from	1
his	1
girdle;	1
"every	1
mother's	1
son	1
of	1
ye	1
draw	1
his	1
knife,	1
and	1
pull	1
with	1
the	1
blade	1
between	1
his	1
teeth.	1
That's	1
it--that's	1
it.	1
Now	1
ye	1
do	1
something;	1
that	1
looks	1
like	1
it,	1
my	1
steel-bits.	1
Start	1
her--start	1
her,	1
my	1
silver-spoons!	1
Start	1
her,	1
marling-spikes!"	1
Stubb's	1
exordium	1
to	1
his	1
crew	1
is	1
given	1
here	1
at	1
large,	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
rather	1
a	1
peculiar	1
way	1
of	1
talking	1
to	1
them	1
in	1
general,	1
and	1
especially	1
in	1
inculcating	1
the	1
religion	1
of	1
rowing.	1
But	1
you	1
must	1
not	1
suppose	1
from	1
this	1
specimen	1
of	1
his	1
sermonizings	1
that	1
he	1
ever	1
flew	1
into	1
downright	1
passions	1
with	1
his	1
congregation.	1
Not	1
at	1
all;	1
and	1
therein	1
consisted	1
his	1
chief	1
peculiarity.	1
He	1
would	1
say	1
the	1
most	1
terrific	1
things	1
to	1
his	1
crew,	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
so	1
strangely	1
compounded	1
of	1
fun	1
and	1
fury,	1
and	1
the	1
fury	1
seemed	1
so	1
calculated	1
merely	1
as	1
a	1
spice	1
to	1
the	1
fun,	1
that	1
no	1
oarsman	1
could	1
hear	1
such	1
queer	1
invocations	1
without	1
pulling	1
for	1
dear	1
life,	1
and	1
yet	1
pulling	1
for	1
the	1
mere	1
joke	1
of	1
the	1
thing.	1
Besides	1
he	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
looked	1
so	1
easy	1
and	1
indolent	1
himself,	1
so	1
loungingly	1
managed	1
his	1
steering-oar,	1
and	1
so	1
broadly	1
gaped--open-mouthed	1
at	1
times--that	1
the	1
mere	1
sight	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
yawning	1
commander,	1
by	1
sheer	1
force	1
of	1
contrast,	1
acted	1
like	1
a	1
charm	1
upon	1
the	1
crew.	1
Then	1
again,	1
Stubb	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
odd	1
sort	1
of	1
humorists,	1
whose	1
jollity	1
is	1
sometimes	1
so	1
curiously	1
ambiguous,	1
as	1
to	1
put	1
all	1
inferiors	1
on	1
their	1
guard	1
in	1
the	1
matter	1
of	1
obeying	1
them.	1
In	1
obedience	1
to	1
a	1
sign	1
from	1
Ahab,	1
Starbuck	1
was	1
now	1
pulling	1
obliquely	1
across	1
Stubb's	1
bow;	1
and	1
when	1
for	1
a	1
minute	1
or	1
so	1
the	1
two	1
boats	1
were	1
pretty	1
near	1
to	1
each	1
other,	1
Stubb	1
hailed	1
the	1
mate.	1
"Mr.	1
Starbuck!	1
larboard	1
boat	1
there,	1
ahoy!	1
a	1
word	1
with	1
ye,	1
sir,	1
if	1
ye	1
please!"	1
"Halloa!"	1
returned	1
Starbuck,	1
turning	1
round	1
not	1
a	1
single	1
inch	1
as	1
he	1
spoke;	1
still	1
earnestly	1
but	1
whisperingly	1
urging	1
his	1
crew;	1
his	1
face	1
set	1
like	1
a	1
flint	1
from	1
Stubb's.	1
"What	1
think	1
ye	1
of	1
those	1
yellow	1
boys,	1
sir!	1
"Smuggled	1
on	1
board,	1
somehow,	1
before	1
the	1
ship	1
sailed.	1
(Strong,	1
strong,	1
boys!)"	1
in	1
a	1
whisper	1
to	1
his	1
crew,	1
then	1
speaking	1
out	1
loud	1
again:	1
"A	1
sad	1
business,	1
Mr.	1
Stubb!	1
(seethe	1
her,	1
seethe	1
her,	1
my	1
lads!)	1
but	1
never	1
mind,	1
Mr.	1
Stubb,	1
all	1
for	1
the	1
best.	1
Let	1
all	1
your	1
crew	1
pull	1
strong,	1
come	1
what	1
will.	1
(Spring,	1
my	1
men,	1
spring!)	1
There's	1
hogsheads	1
of	1
sperm	1
ahead,	1
Mr.	1
Stubb,	1
and	1
that's	1
what	1
ye	1
came	1
for.	1
(Pull,	1
my	1
boys!)	1
Sperm,	1
sperm's	1
the	1
play!	1
This	1
at	1
least	1
is	1
duty;	1
duty	1
and	1
profit	1
hand	1
in	1
hand."	1
"Aye,	1
aye,	1
I	1
thought	1
as	1
much,"	1
soliloquized	1
Stubb,	1
when	1
the	1
boats	1
diverged,	1
"as	1
soon	1
as	1
I	1
clapt	1
eye	1
on	1
'em,	1
I	1
thought	1
so.	1
Aye,	1
and	1
that's	1
what	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
after	1
hold	1
for,	1
so	1
often,	1
as	1
Dough-Boy	1
long	1
suspected.	1
They	1
were	1
hidden	1
down	1
there.	1
The	1
White	1
Whale's	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
it.	1
Well,	1
well,	1
so	1
be	1
it!	1
Can't	1
be	1
helped!	1
All	1
right!	1
Give	1
way,	1
men!	1
It	1
ain't	1
the	1
White	1
Whale	1
to-day!	1
Give	1
way!"	1
Now	1
the	1
advent	1
of	1
these	1
outlandish	1
strangers	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
critical	1
instant	1
as	1
the	1
lowering	1
of	1
the	1
boats	1
from	1
the	1
deck,	1
this	1
had	1
not	1
unreasonably	1
awakened	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
superstitious	1
amazement	1
in	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
ship's	1
company;	1
but	1
Archy's	1
fancied	1
discovery	1
having	1
some	1
time	1
previous	1
got	1
abroad	1
among	1
them,	1
though	1
indeed	1
not	1
credited	1
then,	1
this	1
had	1
in	1
some	1
small	1
measure	1
prepared	1
them	1
for	1
the	1
event.	1
It	1
took	1
off	1
the	1
extreme	1
edge	1
of	1
their	1
wonder;	1
and	1
so	1
what	1
with	1
all	1
this	1
and	1
Stubb's	1
confident	1
way	1
of	1
accounting	1
for	1
their	1
appearance,	1
they	1
were	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
freed	1
from	1
superstitious	1
surmisings;	1
though	1
the	1
affair	1
still	1
left	1
abundant	1
room	1
for	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
wild	1
conjectures	1
as	1
to	1
dark	1
Ahab's	1
precise	1
agency	1
in	1
the	1
matter	1
from	1
the	1
beginning.	1
For	1
me,	1
I	1
silently	1
recalled	1
the	1
mysterious	1
shadows	1
I	1
had	1
seen	1
creeping	1
on	1
board	1
the	1
Pequod	1
during	1
the	1
dim	1
Nantucket	1
dawn,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
enigmatical	1
hintings	1
of	1
the	1
unaccountable	1
Elijah.	1
Meantime,	1
Ahab,	1
out	1
of	1
hearing	1
of	1
his	1
officers,	1
having	1
sided	1
the	1
furthest	1
to	1
windward,	1
was	1
still	1
ranging	1
ahead	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
boats;	1
a	1
circumstance	1
bespeaking	1
how	1
potent	1
a	1
crew	1
was	1
pulling	1
him.	1
Those	1
tiger	1
yellow	1
creatures	1
of	1
his	1
seemed	1
all	1
steel	1
and	1
whalebone;	1
like	1
five	1
trip-hammers	1
they	1
rose	1
and	1
fell	1
with	1
regular	1
strokes	1
of	1
strength,	1
which	1
periodically	1
started	1
the	1
boat	1
along	1
the	1
water	1
like	1
a	1
horizontal	1
burst	1
boiler	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
Mississippi	1
steamer.	1
As	1
for	1
Fedallah,	1
who	1
was	1
seen	1
pulling	1
the	1
harpooneer	1
oar,	1
he	1
had	1
thrown	1
aside	1
his	1
black	1
jacket,	1
and	1
displayed	1
his	1
naked	1
chest	1
with	1
the	1
whole	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
body	1
above	1
the	1
gunwale,	1
clearly	1
cut	1
against	1
the	1
alternating	1
depressions	1
of	1
the	1
watery	1
horizon;	1
while	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
boat	1
Ahab,	1
with	1
one	1
arm,	1
like	1
a	1
fencer's,	1
thrown	1
half	1
backward	1
into	1
the	1
air,	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
counterbalance	1
any	1
tendency	1
to	1
trip;	1
Ahab	1
was	1
seen	1
steadily	1
managing	1
his	1
steering	1
oar	1
as	1
in	1
a	1
thousand	1
boat	1
lowerings	1
ere	1
the	1
White	1
Whale	1
had	1
torn	1
him.	1
All	1
at	1
once	1
the	1
outstretched	1
arm	1
gave	1
a	1
peculiar	1
motion	1
and	1
then	1
remained	1
fixed,	1
while	1
the	1
boat's	1
five	1
oars	1
were	1
seen	1
simultaneously	1
peaked.	1
Boat	1
and	1
crew	1
sat	1
motionless	1
on	1
the	1
sea.	1
Instantly	1
the	1
three	1
spread	1
boats	1
in	1
the	1
rear	1
paused	1
on	1
their	1
way.	1
The	1
whales	1
had	1
irregularly	1
settled	1
bodily	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
blue,	1
thus	1
giving	1
no	1
distantly	1
discernible	1
token	1
of	1
the	1
movement,	1
though	1
from	1
his	1
closer	1
vicinity	1
Ahab	1
had	1
observed	1
it.	1
"Every	1
man	1
look	1
out	1
along	1
his	1
oars!"	1
cried	1
Starbuck.	1
"Thou,	1
Queequeg,	1
stand	1
up!"	1
Nimbly	1
springing	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
triangular	1
raised	1
box	1
in	1
the	1
bow,	1
the	1
savage	1
stood	1
erect	1
there,	1
and	1
with	1
intensely	1
eager	1
eyes	1
gazed	1
off	1
towards	1
the	1
spot	1
where	1
the	1
chase	1
had	1
last	1
been	1
descried.	1
Likewise	1
upon	1
the	1
extreme	1
stern	1
of	1
the	1
boat	1
where	1
it	1
was	1
also	1
triangularly	1
platformed	1
level	1
with	1
the	1
gunwale,	1
Starbuck	1
himself	1
was	1
seen	1
coolly	1
and	1
adroitly	1
balancing	1
himself	1
to	1
the	1
jerking	1
tossings	1
of	1
his	1
chip	1
of	1
a	1
craft,	1
and	1
silently	1
eyeing	1
the	1
vast	1
blue	1
eye	1
of	1
the	1
sea.	1
Not	1
very	1
far	1
distant	1
Flask's	1
boat	1
was	1
also	1
lying	1
breathlessly	1
still;	1
its	1
commander	1
recklessly	1
standing	1
upon	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
loggerhead,	1
a	1
stout	1
sort	1
of	1
post	1
rooted	1
in	1
the	1
keel,	1
and	1
rising	1
some	1
two	1
feet	1
above	1
the	1
level	1
of	1
the	1
stern	1
platform.	1
It	1
is	1
used	1
for	1
catching	1
turns	1
with	1
the	1
whale	1
line.	1
Its	1
top	1
is	1
not	1
more	1
spacious	1
than	1
the	1
palm	1
of	1
a	1
man's	1
hand,	1
and	1
standing	1
upon	1
such	1
a	1
base	1
as	1
that,	1
Flask	1
seemed	1
perched	1
at	1
the	1
mast-head	1
of	1
some	1
ship	1
which	1
had	1
sunk	1
to	1
all	1
but	1
her	1
trucks.	1
But	1
little	1
King-Post	1
was	1
small	1
and	1
short,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
little	1
King-Post	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
a	1
large	1
and	1
tall	1
ambition,	1
so	1
that	1
this	1
loggerhead	1
stand-point	1
of	1
his	1
did	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
satisfy	1
King-Post.	1
"I	1
can't	1
see	1
three	1
seas	1
off;	1
tip	1
us	1
up	1
an	1
oar	1
there,	1
and	1
let	1
me	1
on	1
to	1
that."	1
Upon	1
this,	1
Daggoo,	1
with	1
either	1
hand	1
upon	1
the	1
gunwale	1
to	1
steady	1
his	1
way,	1
swiftly	1
slid	1
aft,	1
and	1
then	1
erecting	1
himself	1
volunteered	1
his	1
lofty	1
shoulders	1
for	1
a	1
pedestal.	1
"Good	1
a	1
mast-head	1
as	1
any,	1
sir.	1
Will	1
you	1
mount?"	1
"That	1
I	1
will,	1
and	1
thank	1
ye	1
very	1
much,	1
my	1
fine	1
fellow;	1
only	1
I	1
wish	1
you	1
fifty	1
feet	1
taller."	1
Whereupon	1
planting	1
his	1
feet	1
firmly	1
against	1
two	1
opposite	1
planks	1
of	1
the	1
boat,	1
the	1
gigantic	1
negro,	1
stooping	1
a	1
little,	1
presented	1
his	1
flat	1
palm	1
to	1
Flask's	1
foot,	1
and	1
then	1
putting	1
Flask's	1
hand	1
on	1
his	1
hearse-plumed	1
head	1
and	1
bidding	1
him	1
spring	1
as	1
he	1
himself	1
should	1
toss,	1
with	1
one	1
dexterous	1
fling	1
landed	1
the	1
little	1
man	1
high	1
and	1
dry	1
on	1
his	1
shoulders.	1
And	1
here	1
was	1
Flask	1
now	1
standing,	1
Daggoo	1
with	1
one	1
lifted	1
arm	1
furnishing	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
breastband	1
to	1
lean	1
against	1
and	1
steady	1
himself	1
by.	1
At	1
any	1
time	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
strange	1
sight	1
to	1
the	1
tyro	1
to	1
see	1
with	1
what	1
wondrous	1
habitude	1
of	1
unconscious	1
skill	1
the	1
whaleman	1
will	1
maintain	1
an	1
erect	1
posture	1
in	1
his	1
boat,	1
even	1
when	1
pitched	1
about	1
by	1
the	1
most	1
riotously	1
perverse	1
and	1
cross-running	1
seas.	1
Still	1
more	1
strange	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
giddily	1
perched	1
upon	1
the	1
loggerhead	1
itself,	1
under	1
such	1
circumstances.	1
But	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
little	1
Flask	1
mounted	1
upon	1
gigantic	1
Daggoo	1
was	1
yet	1
more	1
curious;	1
for	1
sustaining	1
himself	1
with	1
a	1
cool,	1
indifferent,	1
easy,	1
unthought	1
of,	1
barbaric	1
majesty,	1
the	1
noble	1
negro	1
to	1
every	1
roll	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
harmoniously	1
rolled	1
his	1
fine	1
form.	1
On	1
his	1
broad	1
back,	1
flaxen-haired	1
Flask	1
seemed	1
a	1
snow-flake.	1
The	1
bearer	1
looked	1
nobler	1
than	1
the	1
rider.	1
Though	1
truly	1
vivacious,	1
tumultuous,	1
ostentatious	1
little	1
Flask	1
would	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
stamp	1
with	1
impatience;	1
but	1
not	1
one	1
added	1
heave	1
did	1
he	1
thereby	1
give	1
to	1
the	1
negro's	1
lordly	1
chest.	1
So	1
have	1
I	1
seen	1
Passion	1
and	1
Vanity	1
stamping	1
the	1
living	1
magnanimous	1
earth,	1
but	1
the	1
earth	1
did	1
not	1
alter	1
her	1
tides	1
and	1
her	1
seasons	1
for	1
that.	1
Meanwhile	1
Stubb,	1
the	1
third	1
mate,	1
betrayed	1
no	1
such	1
far-gazing	1
solicitudes.	1
The	1
whales	1
might	1
have	1
made	1
one	1
of	1
their	1
regular	1
soundings,	1
not	1
a	1
temporary	1
dive	1
from	1
mere	1
fright;	1
and	1
if	1
that	1
were	1
the	1
case,	1
Stubb,	1
as	1
his	1
wont	1
in	1
such	1
cases,	1
it	1
seems,	1
was	1
resolved	1
to	1
solace	1
the	1
languishing	1
interval	1
with	1
his	1
pipe.	1
He	1
withdrew	1
it	1
from	1
his	1
hatband,	1
where	1
he	1
always	1
wore	1
it	1
aslant	1
like	1
a	1
feather.	1
He	1
loaded	1
it,	1
and	1
rammed	1
home	1
the	1
loading	1
with	1
his	1
thumb-end;	1
but	1
hardly	1
had	1
he	1
ignited	1
his	1
match	1
across	1
the	1
rough	1
sandpaper	1
of	1
his	1
hand,	1
when	1
Tashtego,	1
his	1
harpooneer,	1
whose	1
eyes	1
had	1
been	1
setting	1
to	1
windward	1
like	1
two	1
fixed	1
stars,	1
suddenly	1
dropped	1
like	1
light	1
from	1
his	1
erect	1
attitude	1
to	1
his	1
seat,	1
crying	1
out	1
in	1
a	1
quick	1
phrensy	1
of	1
hurry,	1
"Down,	1
down	1
all,	1
and	1
give	1
way!--there	1
they	1
are!"	1
To	1
a	1
landsman,	1
no	1
whale,	1
nor	1
any	1
sign	1
of	1
a	1
herring,	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
visible	1
at	1
that	1
moment;	1
nothing	1
but	1
a	1
troubled	1
bit	1
of	1
greenish	1
white	1
water,	1
and	1
thin	1
scattered	1
puffs	1
of	1
vapour	1
hovering	1
over	1
it,	1
and	1
suffusingly	1
blowing	1
off	1
to	1
leeward,	1
like	1
the	1
confused	1
scud	1
from	1
white	1
rolling	1
billows.	1
The	1
air	1
around	1
suddenly	1
vibrated	1
and	1
tingled,	1
as	1
it	1
were,	1
like	1
the	1
air	1
over	1
intensely	1
heated	1
plates	1
of	1
iron.	1
Beneath	1
this	1
atmospheric	1
waving	1
and	1
curling,	1
and	1
partially	1
beneath	1
a	1
thin	1
layer	1
of	1
water,	1
also,	1
the	1
whales	1
were	1
swimming.	1
Seen	1
in	1
advance	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
other	1
indications,	1
the	1
puffs	1
of	1
vapour	1
they	1
spouted,	1
seemed	1
their	1
forerunning	1
couriers	1
and	1
detached	1
flying	1
outriders.	1
All	1
four	1
boats	1
were	1
now	1
in	1
keen	1
pursuit	1
of	1
that	1
one	1
spot	1
of	1
troubled	1
water	1
and	1
air.	1
But	1
it	1
bade	1
fair	1
to	1
outstrip	1
them;	1
it	1
flew	1
on	1
and	1
on,	1
as	1
a	1
mass	1
of	1
interblending	1
bubbles	1
borne	1
down	1
a	1
rapid	1
stream	1
from	1
the	1
hills.	1
"Pull,	1
pull,	1
my	1
good	1
boys,"	1
said	1
Starbuck,	1
in	1
the	1
lowest	1
possible	1
but	1
intensest	1
concentrated	1
whisper	1
to	1
his	1
men;	1
while	1
the	1
sharp	1
fixed	1
glance	1
from	1
his	1
eyes	1
darted	1
straight	1
ahead	1
of	1
the	1
bow,	1
almost	1
seemed	1
as	1
two	1
visible	1
needles	1
in	1
two	1
unerring	1
binnacle	1
compasses.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
say	1
much	1
to	1
his	1
crew,	1
though,	1
nor	1
did	1
his	1
crew	1
say	1
anything	1
to	1
him.	1
Only	1
the	1
silence	1
of	1
the	1
boat	1
was	1
at	1
intervals	1
startlingly	1
pierced	1
by	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
peculiar	1
whispers,	1
now	1
harsh	1
with	1
command,	1
now	1
soft	1
with	1
entreaty.	1
How	1
different	1
the	1
loud	1
little	1
King-Post.	1
"Sing	1
out	1
and	1
say	1
something,	1
my	1
hearties.	1
Roar	1
and	1
pull,	1
my	1
thunderbolts!	1
Beach	1
me,	1
beach	1
me	1
on	1
their	1
black	1
backs,	1
boys;	1
only	1
do	1
that	1
for	1
me,	1
and	1
I'll	1
sign	1
over	1
to	1
you	1
my	1
Martha's	1
Vineyard	1
plantation,	1
boys;	1
including	1
wife	1
and	1
children,	1
boys.	1
Lay	1
me	1
on--lay	1
me	1
on!	1
O	1
Lord,	1
Lord!	1
but	1
I	1
shall	1
go	1
stark,	1
staring	1
mad!	1
See!	1
see	1
that	1
white	1
water!"	1
And	1
so	1
shouting,	1
he	1
pulled	1
his	1
hat	1
from	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
stamped	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
on	1
it;	1
then	1
picking	1
it	1
up,	1
flirted	1
it	1
far	1
off	1
upon	1
the	1
sea;	1
and	1
finally	1
fell	1
to	1
rearing	1
and	1
plunging	1
in	1
the	1
boat's	1
stern	1
like	1
a	1
crazed	1
colt	1
from	1
the	1
prairie.	1
"Look	1
at	1
that	1
chap	1
now,"	1
philosophically	1
drawled	1
Stubb,	1
who,	1
with	1
his	1
unlighted	1
short	1
pipe,	1
mechanically	1
retained	1
between	1
his	1
teeth,	1
at	1
a	1
short	1
distance,	1
followed	1
after--"He's	1
got	1
fits,	1
that	1
Flask	1
has.	1
Fits?	1
yes,	1
give	1
him	1
fits--that's	1
the	1
very	1
word--pitch	1
fits	1
into	1
'em.	1
Merrily,	1
merrily,	1
hearts-alive.	1
Pudding	1
for	1
supper,	1
you	1
know;--merry's	1
the	1
word.	1
Pull,	1
babes--pull,	1
sucklings--pull,	1
all.	1
But	1
what	1
the	1
devil	1
are	1
you	1
hurrying	1
about?	1
Softly,	1
softly,	1
and	1
steadily,	1
my	1
men.	1
Only	1
pull,	1
and	1
keep	1
pulling;	1
nothing	1
more.	1
Crack	1
all	1
your	1
backbones,	1
and	1
bite	1
your	1
knives	1
in	1
two--that's	1
all.	1
Take	1
it	1
easy--why	1
don't	1
ye	1
take	1
it	1
easy,	1
I	1
say,	1
and	1
burst	1
all	1
your	1
livers	1
and	1
lungs!"	1
But	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
inscrutable	1
Ahab	1
said	1
to	1
that	1
tiger-yellow	1
crew	1
of	1
his--these	1
were	1
words	1
best	1
omitted	1
here;	1
for	1
you	1
live	1
under	1
the	1
blessed	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
evangelical	1
land.	1
Only	1
the	1
infidel	1
sharks	1
in	1
the	1
audacious	1
seas	1
may	1
give	1
ear	1
to	1
such	1
words,	1
when,	1
with	1
tornado	1
brow,	1
and	1
eyes	1
of	1
red	1
murder,	1
and	1
foam-glued	1
lips,	1
Ahab	1
leaped	1
after	1
his	1
prey.	1
Meanwhile,	1
all	1
the	1
boats	1
tore	1
on.	1
The	1
repeated	1
specific	1
allusions	1
of	1
Flask	1
to	1
"that	1
whale,"	1
as	1
he	1
called	1
the	1
fictitious	1
monster	1
which	1
he	1
declared	1
to	1
be	1
incessantly	1
tantalizing	1
his	1
boat's	1
bow	1
with	1
its	1
tail--these	1
allusions	1
of	1
his	1
were	1
at	1
times	1
so	1
vivid	1
and	1
life-like,	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
cause	1
some	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
of	1
his	1
men	1
to	1
snatch	1
a	1
fearful	1
look	1
over	1
the	1
shoulder.	1
But	1
this	1
was	1
against	1
all	1
rule;	1
for	1
the	1
oarsmen	1
must	1
put	1
out	1
their	1
eyes,	1
and	1
ram	1
a	1
skewer	1
through	1
their	1
necks;	1
usage	1
pronouncing	1
that	1
they	1
must	1
have	1
no	1
organs	1
but	1
ears,	1
and	1
no	1
limbs	1
but	1
arms,	1
in	1
these	1
critical	1
moments.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
sight	1
full	1
of	1
quick	1
wonder	1
and	1
awe!	1
The	1
vast	1
swells	1
of	1
the	1
omnipotent	1
sea;	1
the	1
surging,	1
hollow	1
roar	1
they	1
made,	1
as	1
they	1
rolled	1
along	1
the	1
eight	1
gunwales,	1
like	1
gigantic	1
bowls	1
in	1
a	1
boundless	1
bowling-green;	1
the	1
brief	1
suspended	1
agony	1
of	1
the	1
boat,	1
as	1
it	1
would	1
tip	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
on	1
the	1
knife-like	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
sharper	1
waves,	1
that	1
almost	1
seemed	1
threatening	1
to	1
cut	1
it	1
in	1
two;	1
the	1
sudden	1
profound	1
dip	1
into	1
the	1
watery	1
glens	1
and	1
hollows;	1
the	1
keen	1
spurrings	1
and	1
goadings	1
to	1
gain	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
opposite	1
hill;	1
the	1
headlong,	1
sled-like	1
slide	1
down	1
its	1
other	1
side;--all	1
these,	1
with	1
the	1
cries	1
of	1
the	1
headsmen	1
and	1
harpooneers,	1
and	1
the	1
shuddering	1
gasps	1
of	1
the	1
oarsmen,	1
with	1
the	1
wondrous	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
ivory	1
Pequod	1
bearing	1
down	1
upon	1
her	1
boats	1
with	1
outstretched	1
sails,	1
like	1
a	1
wild	1
hen	1
after	1
her	1
screaming	1
brood;--all	1
this	1
was	1
thrilling.	1
Not	1
the	1
raw	1
recruit,	1
marching	1
from	1
the	1
bosom	1
of	1
his	1
wife	1
into	1
the	1
fever	1
heat	1
of	1
his	1
first	1
battle;	1
not	1
the	1
dead	1
man's	1
ghost	1
encountering	1
the	1
first	1
unknown	1
phantom	1
in	1
the	1
other	1
world;--neither	1
of	1
these	1
can	1
feel	1
stranger	1
and	1
stronger	1
emotions	1
than	1
that	1
man	1
does,	1
who	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
finds	1
himself	1
pulling	1
into	1
the	1
charmed,	1
churned	1
circle	1
of	1
the	1
hunted	1
sperm	1
whale.	1
The	1
dancing	1
white	1
water	1
made	1
by	1
the	1
chase	1
was	1
now	1
becoming	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
visible,	1
owing	1
to	1
the	1
increasing	1
darkness	1
of	1
the	1
dun	1
cloud-shadows	1
flung	1
upon	1
the	1
sea.	1
The	1
jets	1
of	1
vapour	1
no	1
longer	1
blended,	1
but	1
tilted	1
everywhere	1
to	1
right	1
and	1
left;	1
the	1
whales	1
seemed	1
separating	1
their	1
wakes.	1
The	1
boats	1
were	1
pulled	1
more	1
apart;	1
Starbuck	1
giving	1
chase	1
to	1
three	1
whales	1
running	1
dead	1
to	1
leeward.	1
Our	1
sail	1
was	1
now	1
set,	1
and,	1
with	1
the	1
still	1
rising	1
wind,	1
we	1
rushed	1
along;	1
the	1
boat	1
going	1
with	1
such	1
madness	1
through	1
the	1
water,	1
that	1
the	1
lee	1
oars	1
could	1
scarcely	1
be	1
worked	1
rapidly	1
enough	1
to	1
escape	1
being	1
torn	1
from	1
the	1
row-locks.	1
Soon	1
we	1
were	1
running	1
through	1
a	1
suffusing	1
wide	1
veil	1
of	1
mist;	1
neither	1
ship	1
nor	1
boat	1
to	1
be	1
seen.	1
"Give	1
way,	1
men,"	1
whispered	1
Starbuck,	1
drawing	1
still	1
further	1
aft	1
the	1
sheet	1
of	1
his	1
sail;	1
"there	1
is	1
time	1
to	1
kill	1
a	1
fish	1
yet	1
before	1
the	1
squall	1
comes.	1
There's	1
white	1
water	1
again!--close	1
to!	1
Spring!"	1
Soon	1
after,	1
two	1
cries	1
in	1
quick	1
succession	1
on	1
each	1
side	1
of	1
us	1
denoted	1
that	1
the	1
other	1
boats	1
had	1
got	1
fast;	1
but	1
hardly	1
were	1
they	1
overheard,	1
when	1
with	1
a	1
lightning-like	1
hurtling	1
whisper	1
Starbuck	1
said:	1
"Stand	1
up!"	1
and	1
Queequeg,	1
harpoon	1
in	1
hand,	1
sprang	1
to	1
his	1
feet.	1
Though	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
oarsmen	1
was	1
then	1
facing	1
the	1
life	1
and	1
death	1
peril	1
so	1
close	1
to	1
them	1
ahead,	1
yet	1
with	1
their	1
eyes	1
on	1
the	1
intense	1
countenance	1
of	1
the	1
mate	1
in	1
the	1
stern	1
of	1
the	1
boat,	1
they	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
imminent	1
instant	1
had	1
come;	1
they	1
heard,	1
too,	1
an	1
enormous	1
wallowing	1
sound	1
as	1
of	1
fifty	1
elephants	1
stirring	1
in	1
their	1
litter.	1
Meanwhile	1
the	1
boat	1
was	1
still	1
booming	1
through	1
the	1
mist,	1
the	1
waves	1
curling	1
and	1
hissing	1
around	1
us	1
like	1
the	1
erected	1
crests	1
of	1
enraged	1
serpents.	1
"That's	1
his	1
hump.	1
THERE,	1
THERE,	1
give	1
it	1
to	1
him!"	1
whispered	1
Starbuck.	1
A	1
short	1
rushing	1
sound	1
leaped	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
boat;	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
darted	1
iron	1
of	1
Queequeg.	1
Then	1
all	1
in	1
one	1
welded	1
commotion	1
came	1
an	1
invisible	1
push	1
from	1
astern,	1
while	1
forward	1
the	1
boat	1
seemed	1
striking	1
on	1
a	1
ledge;	1
the	1
sail	1
collapsed	1
and	1
exploded;	1
a	1
gush	1
of	1
scalding	1
vapour	1
shot	1
up	1
near	1
by;	1
something	1
rolled	1
and	1
tumbled	1
like	1
an	1
earthquake	1
beneath	1
us.	1
The	1
whole	1
crew	1
were	1
half	1
suffocated	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
tossed	1
helter-skelter	1
into	1
the	1
white	1
curdling	1
cream	1
of	1
the	1
squall.	1
Squall,	1
whale,	1
and	1
harpoon	1
had	1
all	1
blended	1
together;	1
and	1
the	1
whale,	1
merely	1
grazed	1
by	1
the	1
iron,	1
escaped.	1
Though	1
completely	1
swamped,	1
the	1
boat	1
was	1
nearly	1
unharmed.	1
Swimming	1
round	1
it	1
we	1
picked	1
up	1
the	1
floating	1
oars,	1
and	1
lashing	1
them	1
across	1
the	1
gunwale,	1
tumbled	1
back	1
to	1
our	1
places.	1
There	1
we	1
sat	1
up	1
to	1
our	1
knees	1
in	1
the	1
sea,	1
the	1
water	1
covering	1
every	1
rib	1
and	1
plank,	1
so	1
that	1
to	1
our	1
downward	1
gazing	1
eyes	1
the	1
suspended	1
craft	1
seemed	1
a	1
coral	1
boat	1
grown	1
up	1
to	1
us	1
from	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
ocean.	1
The	1
wind	1
increased	1
to	1
a	1
howl;	1
the	1
waves	1
dashed	1
their	1
bucklers	1
together;	1
the	1
whole	1
squall	1
roared,	1
forked,	1
and	1
crackled	1
around	1
us	1
like	1
a	1
white	1
fire	1
upon	1
the	1
prairie,	1
in	1
which,	1
unconsumed,	1
we	1
were	1
burning;	1
immortal	1
in	1
these	1
jaws	1
of	1
death!	1
In	1
vain	1
we	1
hailed	1
the	1
other	1
boats;	1
as	1
well	1
roar	1
to	1
the	1
live	1
coals	1
down	1
the	1
chimney	1
of	1
a	1
flaming	1
furnace	1
as	1
hail	1
those	1
boats	1
in	1
that	1
storm.	1
Meanwhile	1
the	1
driving	1
scud,	1
rack,	1
and	1
mist,	1
grew	1
darker	1
with	1
the	1
shadows	1
of	1
night;	1
no	1
sign	1
of	1
the	1
ship	1
could	1
be	1
seen.	1
The	1
rising	1
sea	1
forbade	1
all	1
attempts	1
to	1
bale	1
out	1
the	1
boat.	1
The	1
oars	1
were	1
useless	1
as	1
propellers,	1
performing	1
now	1
the	1
office	1
of	1
life-preservers.	1
So,	1
cutting	1
the	1
lashing	1
of	1
the	1
waterproof	1
match	1
keg,	1
after	1
many	1
failures	1
Starbuck	1
contrived	1
to	1
ignite	1
the	1
lamp	1
in	1
the	1
lantern;	1
then	1
stretching	1
it	1
on	1
a	1
waif	1
pole,	1
handed	1
it	1
to	1
Queequeg	1
as	1
the	1
standard-bearer	1
of	1
this	1
forlorn	1
hope.	1
There,	1
then,	1
he	1
sat,	1
holding	1
up	1
that	1
imbecile	1
candle	1
in	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
that	1
almighty	1
forlornness.	1
There,	1
then,	1
he	1
sat,	1
the	1
sign	1
and	1
symbol	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
without	1
faith,	1
hopelessly	1
holding	1
up	1
hope	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
despair.	1
Wet,	1
drenched	1
through,	1
and	1
shivering	1
cold,	1
despairing	1
of	1
ship	1
or	1
boat,	1
we	1
lifted	1
up	1
our	1
eyes	1
as	1
the	1
dawn	1
came	1
on.	1
The	1
mist	1
still	1
spread	1
over	1
the	1
sea,	1
the	1
empty	1
lantern	1
lay	1
crushed	1
in	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
boat.	1
Suddenly	1
Queequeg	1
started	1
to	1
his	1
feet,	1
hollowing	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
his	1
ear.	1
We	1
all	1
heard	1
a	1
faint	1
creaking,	1
as	1
of	1
ropes	1
and	1
yards	1
hitherto	1
muffled	1
by	1
the	1
storm.	1
The	1
sound	1
came	1
nearer	1
and	1
nearer;	1
the	1
thick	1
mists	1
were	1
dimly	1
parted	1
by	1
a	1
huge,	1
vague	1
form.	1
Affrighted,	1
we	1
all	1
sprang	1
into	1
the	1
sea	1
as	1
the	1
ship	1
at	1
last	1
loomed	1
into	1
view,	1
bearing	1
right	1
down	1
upon	1
us	1
within	1
a	1
distance	1
of	1
not	1
much	1
more	1
than	1
its	1
length.	1
Floating	1
on	1
the	1
waves	1
we	1
saw	1
the	1
abandoned	1
boat,	1
as	1
for	1
one	1
instant	1
it	1
tossed	1
and	1
gaped	1
beneath	1
the	1
ship's	1
bows	1
like	1
a	1
chip	1
at	1
the	1
base	1
of	1
a	1
cataract;	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
vast	1
hull	1
rolled	1
over	1
it,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
seen	1
no	1
more	1
till	1
it	1
came	1
up	1
weltering	1
astern.	1
Again	1
we	1
swam	1
for	1
it,	1
were	1
dashed	1
against	1
it	1
by	1
the	1
seas,	1
and	1
were	1
at	1
last	1
taken	1
up	1
and	1
safely	1
landed	1
on	1
board.	1
Ere	1
the	1
squall	1
came	1
close	1
to,	1
the	1
other	1
boats	1
had	1
cut	1
loose	1
from	1
their	1
fish	1
and	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
ship	1
in	1
good	1
time.	1
The	1
ship	1
had	1
given	1
us	1
up,	1
but	1
was	1
still	1
cruising,	1
if	1
haply	1
it	1
might	1
light	1
upon	1
some	1
token	1
of	1
our	1
perishing,--an	1
oar	1
or	1
a	1
lance	1
pole.	1
CHAPTER	1
49	1
The	1
Hyena.	1
There	1
are	1
certain	1
queer	1
times	1
and	1
occasions	1
in	1
this	1
strange	1
mixed	1
affair	1
we	1
call	1
life	1
when	1
a	1
man	1
takes	1
this	1
whole	1
universe	1
for	1
a	1
vast	1
practical	1
joke,	1
though	1
the	1
wit	1
thereof	1
he	1
but	1
dimly	1
discerns,	1
and	1
more	1
than	1
suspects	1
that	1
the	1
joke	1
is	1
at	1
nobody's	1
expense	1
but	1
his	1
own.	1
However,	1
nothing	1
dispirits,	1
and	1
nothing	1
seems	1
worth	1
while	1
disputing.	1
He	1
bolts	1
down	1
all	1
events,	1
all	1
creeds,	1
and	1
beliefs,	1
and	1
persuasions,	1
all	1
hard	1
things	1
visible	1
and	1
invisible,	1
never	1
mind	1
how	1
knobby;	1
as	1
an	1
ostrich	1
of	1
potent	1
digestion	1
gobbles	1
down	1
bullets	1
and	1
gun	1
flints.	1
And	1
as	1
for	1
small	1
difficulties	1
and	1
worryings,	1
prospects	1
of	1
sudden	1
disaster,	1
peril	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
limb;	1
all	1
these,	1
and	1
death	1
itself,	1
seem	1
to	1
him	1
only	1
sly,	1
good-natured	1
hits,	1
and	1
jolly	1
punches	1
in	1
the	1
side	1
bestowed	1
by	1
the	1
unseen	1
and	1
unaccountable	1
old	1
joker.	1
That	1
odd	1
sort	1
of	1
wayward	1
mood	1
I	1
am	1
speaking	1
of,	1
comes	1
over	1
a	1
man	1
only	1
in	1
some	1
time	1
of	1
extreme	1
tribulation;	1
it	1
comes	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
midst	1
of	1
his	1
earnestness,	1
so	1
that	1
what	1
just	1
before	1
might	1
have	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
a	1
thing	1
most	1
momentous,	1
now	1
seems	1
but	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
general	1
joke.	1
There	1
is	1
nothing	1
like	1
the	1
perils	1
of	1
whaling	1
to	1
breed	1
this	1
free	1
and	1
easy	1
sort	1
of	1
genial,	1
desperado	1
philosophy;	1
and	1
with	1
it	1
I	1
now	1
regarded	1
this	1
whole	1
voyage	1
of	1
the	1
Pequod,	1
and	1
the	1
great	1
White	1
Whale	1
its	1
object.	1
"Queequeg,"	1
said	1
I,	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
dragged	1
me,	1
the	1
last	1
man,	1
to	1
the	1
deck,	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
still	1
shaking	1
myself	1
in	1
my	1
jacket	1
to	1
fling	1
off	1
the	1
water;	1
"Queequeg,	1
my	1
fine	1
friend,	1
does	1
this	1
sort	1
of	1
thing	1
often	1
happen?"	1
Without	1
much	1
emotion,	1
though	1
soaked	1
through	1
just	1
like	1
me,	1
he	1
gave	1
me	1
to	1
understand	1
that	1
such	1
things	1
did	1
often	1
happen.	1
"Mr.	1
Stubb,"	1
said	1
I,	1
turning	1
to	1
that	1
worthy,	1
who,	1
buttoned	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
oil-jacket,	1
was	1
now	1
calmly	1
smoking	1
his	1
pipe	1
in	1
the	1
rain;	1
"Mr.	1
Stubb,	1
I	1
think	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
you	1
say	1
that	1
of	1
all	1
whalemen	1
you	1
ever	1
met,	1
our	1
chief	1
mate,	1
Mr.	1
Starbuck,	1
is	1
by	1
far	1
the	1
most	1
careful	1
and	1
prudent.	1
I	1
suppose	1
then,	1
that	1
going	1
plump	1
on	1
a	1
flying	1
whale	1
with	1
your	1
sail	1
set	1
in	1
a	1
foggy	1
squall	1
is	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
a	1
whaleman's	1
discretion?"	1
"Certain.	1
I've	1
lowered	1
for	1
whales	1
from	1
a	1
leaking	1
ship	1
in	1
a	1
gale	1
off	1
Cape	1
Horn."	1
"Mr.	1
Flask,"	1
said	1
I,	1
turning	1
to	1
little	1
King-Post,	1
who	1
was	1
standing	1
close	1
by;	1
"you	1
are	1
experienced	1
in	1
these	1
things,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
not.	1
Will	1
you	1
tell	1
me	1
whether	1
it	1
is	1
an	1
unalterable	1
law	1
in	1
this	1
fishery,	1
Mr.	1
Flask,	1
for	1
an	1
oarsman	1
to	1
break	1
his	1
own	1
back	1
pulling	1
himself	1
back-foremost	1
into	1
death's	1
jaws?"	1
"Can't	1
you	1
twist	1
that	1
smaller?"	1
said	1
Flask.	1
"Yes,	1
that's	1
the	1
law.	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
see	1
a	1
boat's	1
crew	1
backing	1
water	1
up	1
to	1
a	1
whale	1
face	1
foremost.	1
Ha,	1
ha!	1
the	1
whale	1
would	1
give	1
them	1
squint	1
for	1
squint,	1
mind	1
that!"	1
Here	1
then,	1
from	1
three	1
impartial	1
witnesses,	1
I	1
had	1
a	1
deliberate	1
statement	1
of	1
the	1
entire	1
case.	1
Considering,	1
therefore,	1
that	1
squalls	1
and	1
capsizings	1
in	1
the	1
water	1
and	1
consequent	1
bivouacks	1
on	1
the	1
deep,	1
were	1
matters	1
of	1
common	1
occurrence	1
in	1
this	1
kind	1
of	1
life;	1
considering	1
that	1
at	1
the	1
superlatively	1
critical	1
instant	1
of	1
going	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
whale	1
I	1
must	1
resign	1
my	1
life	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
him	1
who	1
steered	1
the	1
boat--oftentimes	1
a	1
fellow	1
who	1
at	1
that	1
very	1
moment	1
is	1
in	1
his	1
impetuousness	1
upon	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
scuttling	1
the	1
craft	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
frantic	1
stampings;	1
considering	1
that	1
the	1
particular	1
disaster	1
to	1
our	1
own	1
particular	1
boat	1
was	1
chiefly	1
to	1
be	1
imputed	1
to	1
Starbuck's	1
driving	1
on	1
to	1
his	1
whale	1
almost	1
in	1
the	1
teeth	1
of	1
a	1
squall,	1
and	1
considering	1
that	1
Starbuck,	1
notwithstanding,	1
was	1
famous	1
for	1
his	1
great	1
heedfulness	1
in	1
the	1
fishery;	1
considering	1
that	1
I	1
belonged	1
to	1
this	1
uncommonly	1
prudent	1
Starbuck's	1
boat;	1
and	1
finally	1
considering	1
in	1
what	1
a	1
devil's	1
chase	1
I	1
was	1
implicated,	1
touching	1
the	1
White	1
Whale:	1
taking	1
all	1
things	1
together,	1
I	1
say,	1
I	1
thought	1
I	1
might	1
as	1
well	1
go	1
below	1
and	1
make	1
a	1
rough	1
draft	1
of	1
my	1
will.	1
"Queequeg,"	1
said	1
I,	1
"come	1
along,	1
you	1
shall	1
be	1
my	1
lawyer,	1
executor,	1
and	1
legatee."	1
It	1
may	1
seem	1
strange	1
that	1
of	1
all	1
men	1
sailors	1
should	1
be	1
tinkering	1
at	1
their	1
last	1
wills	1
and	1
testaments,	1
but	1
there	1
are	1
no	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
more	1
fond	1
of	1
that	1
diversion.	1
This	1
was	1
the	1
fourth	1
time	1
in	1
my	1
nautical	1
life	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
done	1
the	1
same	1
thing.	1
After	1
the	1
ceremony	1
was	1
concluded	1
upon	1
the	1
present	1
occasion,	1
I	1
felt	1
all	1
the	1
easier;	1
a	1
stone	1
was	1
rolled	1
away	1
from	1
my	1
heart.	1
Besides,	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
I	1
should	1
now	1
live	1
would	1
be	1
as	1
good	1
as	1
the	1
days	1
that	1
Lazarus	1
lived	1
after	1
his	1
resurrection;	1
a	1
supplementary	1
clean	1
gain	1
of	1
so	1
many	1
months	1
or	1
weeks	1
as	1
the	1
case	1
might	1
be.	1
I	1
survived	1
myself;	1
my	1
death	1
and	1
burial	1
were	1
locked	1
up	1
in	1
my	1
chest.	1
I	1
looked	1
round	1
me	1
tranquilly	1
and	1
contentedly,	1
like	1
a	1
quiet	1
ghost	1
with	1
a	1
clean	1
conscience	1
sitting	1
inside	1
the	1
bars	1
of	1
a	1
snug	1
family	1
vault.	1
Now	1
then,	1
thought	1
I,	1
unconsciously	1
rolling	1
up	1
the	1
sleeves	1
of	1
my	1
frock,	1
here	1
goes	1
for	1
a	1
cool,	1
collected	1
dive	1
at	1
death	1
and	1
destruction,	1
and	1
the	1
devil	1
fetch	1
the	1
hindmost.	1
CHAPTER	1

Ahab's	1
Boat	1
and	1
Crew.	1
Fedallah.	1
"Who	1
would	1
have	1
thought	1
it,	1
Flask!"	1
cried	1
Stubb;	1
"if	1
I	1
had	1
but	1
one	1
leg	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
catch	1
me	1
in	1
a	1
boat,	1
unless	1
maybe	1
to	1
stop	1
the	1
plug-hole	1
with	1
my	1
timber	1
toe.	1
Oh!	1
he's	1
a	1
wonderful	1
old	1
man!"	1
"I	1
don't	1
think	1
it	1
so	1
strange,	1
after	1
all,	1
on	1
that	1
account,"	1
said	1
Flask.	1
"If	1
his	1
leg	1
were	1
off	1
at	1
the	1
hip,	1
now,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
different	1
thing.	1
That	1
would	1
disable	1
him;	1
but	1
he	1
has	1
one	1
knee,	1
and	1
good	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
left,	1
you	1
know."	1
"I	1
don't	1
know	1
that,	1
my	1
little	1
man;	1
I	1
never	1
yet	1
saw	1
him	1
kneel."	1
Among	1
whale-wise	1
people	1
it	1
has	1
often	1
been	1
argued	1
whether,	1
considering	1
the	1
paramount	1
importance	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
to	1
the	1
success	1
of	1
the	1
voyage,	1
it	1
is	1
right	1
for	1
a	1
whaling	1
captain	1
to	1
jeopardize	1
that	1
life	1
in	1
the	1
active	1
perils	1
of	1
the	1
chase.	1
So	1
Tamerlane's	1
soldiers	1
often	1
argued	1
with	1
tears	1
in	1
their	1
eyes,	1
whether	1
that	1
invaluable	1
life	1
of	1
his	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
carried	1
into	1
the	1
thickest	1
of	1
the	1
fight.	1
But	1
with	1
Ahab	1
the	1
question	1
assumed	1
a	1
modified	1
aspect.	1
Considering	1
that	1
with	1
two	1
legs	1
man	1
is	1
but	1
a	1
hobbling	1
wight	1
in	1
all	1
times	1
of	1
danger;	1
considering	1
that	1
the	1
pursuit	1
of	1
whales	1
is	1
always	1
under	1
great	1
and	1
extraordinary	1
difficulties;	1
that	1
every	1
individual	1
moment,	1
indeed,	1
then	1
comprises	1
a	1
peril;	1
under	1
these	1
circumstances	1
is	1
it	1
wise	1
for	1
any	1
maimed	1
man	1
to	1
enter	1
a	1
whale-boat	1
in	1
the	1
hunt?	1
As	1
a	1
general	1
thing,	1
the	1
joint-owners	1
of	1
the	1
Pequod	1
must	1
have	1
plainly	1
thought	1
not.	1
Ahab	1
well	1
knew	1
that	1
although	1
his	1
friends	1
at	1
home	1
would	1
think	1
little	1
of	1
his	1
entering	1
a	1
boat	1
in	1
certain	1
comparatively	1
harmless	1
vicissitudes	1
of	1
the	1
chase,	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
being	1
near	1
the	1
scene	1
of	1
action	1
and	1
giving	1
his	1
orders	1
in	1
person,	1
yet	1
for	1
Captain	1
Ahab	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
boat	1
actually	1
apportioned	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
regular	1
headsman	1
in	1
the	1
hunt--above	1
all	1
for	1
Captain	1
Ahab	1
to	1
be	1
supplied	1
with	1
five	1
extra	1
men,	1
as	1
that	1
same	1
boat's	1
crew,	1
he	1
well	1
knew	1
that	1
such	1
generous	1
conceits	1
never	1
entered	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
the	1
owners	1
of	1
the	1
Pequod.	1
Therefore	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
solicited	1
a	1
boat's	1
crew	1
from	1
them,	1
nor	1
had	1
he	1
in	1
any	1
way	1
hinted	1
his	1
desires	1
on	1
that	1
head.	1
Nevertheless	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
private	1
measures	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
touching	1
all	1
that	1
matter.	1
Until	1
Cabaco's	1
published	1
discovery,	1
the	1
sailors	1
had	1
little	1
foreseen	1
it,	1
though	1
to	1
be	1
sure	1
when,	1
after	1
being	1
a	1
little	1
while	1
out	1
of	1
port,	1
all	1
hands	1
had	1
concluded	1
the	1
customary	1
business	1
of	1
fitting	1
the	1
whaleboats	1
for	1
service;	1
when	1
some	1
time	1
after	1
this	1
Ahab	1
was	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
found	1
bestirring	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
matter	1
of	1
making	1
thole-pins	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
hands	1
for	1
what	1
was	1
thought	1
to	1
be	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
spare	1
boats,	1
and	1
even	1
solicitously	1
cutting	1
the	1
small	1
wooden	1
skewers,	1
which	1
when	1
the	1
line	1
is	1
running	1
out	1
are	1
pinned	1
over	1
the	1
groove	1
in	1
the	1
bow:	1
when	1
all	1
this	1
was	1
observed	1
in	1
him,	1
and	1
particularly	1
his	1
solicitude	1
in	1
having	1
an	1
extra	1
coat	1
of	1
sheathing	1
in	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
boat,	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
better	1
withstand	1
the	1
pointed	1
pressure	1
of	1
his	1
ivory	1
limb;	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
anxiety	1
he	1
evinced	1
in	1
exactly	1
shaping	1
the	1
thigh	1
board,	1
or	1
clumsy	1
cleat,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
sometimes	1
called,	1
the	1
horizontal	1
piece	1
in	1
the	1
boat's	1
bow	1
for	1
bracing	1
the	1
knee	1
against	1
in	1
darting	1
or	1
stabbing	1
at	1
the	1
whale;	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
observed	1
how	1
often	1
he	1
stood	1
up	1
in	1
that	1
boat	1
with	1
his	1
solitary	1
knee	1
fixed	1
in	1
the	1
semi-circular	1
depression	1
in	1
the	1
cleat,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
carpenter's	1
chisel	1
gouged	1
out	1
a	1
little	1
here	1
and	1
straightened	1
it	1
a	1
little	1
there;	1
all	1
these	1
things,	1
I	1
say,	1
had	1
awakened	1
much	1
interest	1
and	1
curiosity	1
at	1
the	1
time.	1
But	1
almost	1
everybody	1
supposed	1
that	1
this	1
particular	1
preparative	1
heedfulness	1
in	1
Ahab	1
must	1
only	1
be	1
with	1
a	1
view	1
to	1
the	1
ultimate	1
chase	1
of	1
Moby	1
Dick;	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
revealed	1
his	1
intention	1
to	1
hunt	1
that	1
mortal	1
monster	1
in	1
person.	1
But	1
such	1
a	1
supposition	1
did	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
involve	1
the	1
remotest	1
suspicion	1
as	1
to	1
any	1
boat's	1
crew	1
being	1
assigned	1
to	1
that	1
boat.	1
Now,	1
with	1
the	1
subordinate	1
phantoms,	1
what	1
wonder	1
remained	1
soon	1
waned	1
away;	1
for	1
in	1
a	1
whaler	1
wonders	1
soon	1
wane.	1
Besides,	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
such	1
unaccountable	1
odds	1
and	1
ends	1
of	1
strange	1
nations	1
come	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
unknown	1
nooks	1
and	1
ash-holes	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
to	1
man	1
these	1
floating	1
outlaws	1
of	1
whalers;	1
and	1
the	1
ships	1
themselves	1
often	1
pick	1
up	1
such	1
queer	1
castaway	1
creatures	1
found	1
tossing	1
about	1
the	1
open	1
sea	1
on	1
planks,	1
bits	1
of	1
wreck,	1
oars,	1
whaleboats,	1
canoes,	1
blown-off	1
Japanese	1
junks,	1
and	1
what	1
not;	1
that	1
Beelzebub	1
himself	1
might	1
climb	1
up	1
the	1
side	1
and	1
step	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
cabin	1
to	1
chat	1
with	1
the	1
captain,	1
and	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
create	1
any	1
unsubduable	1
excitement	1
in	1
the	1
forecastle.	1
But	1
be	1
all	1
this	1
as	1
it	1
may,	1
certain	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
while	1
the	1
subordinate	1
phantoms	1
soon	1
found	1
their	1
place	1
among	1
the	1
crew,	1
though	1
still	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
somehow	1
distinct	1
from	1
them,	1
yet	1
that	1
hair-turbaned	1
Fedallah	1
remained	1
a	1
muffled	1
mystery	1
to	1
the	1
last.	1
Whence	1
he	1
came	1
in	1
a	1
mannerly	1
world	1
like	1
this,	1
by	1
what	1
sort	1
of	1
unaccountable	1
tie	1
he	1
soon	1
evinced	1
himself	1
to	1
be	1
linked	1
with	1
Ahab's	1
peculiar	1
fortunes;	1
nay,	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
to	1
have	1
some	1
sort	1
of	1
a	1
half-hinted	1
influence;	1
Heaven	1
knows,	1
but	1
it	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
even	1
authority	1
over	1
him;	1
all	1
this	1
none	1
knew.	1
But	1
one	1
cannot	1
sustain	1
an	1
indifferent	1
air	1
concerning	1
Fedallah.	1
He	1
was	1
such	1
a	1
creature	1
as	1
civilized,	1
domestic	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
temperate	1
zone	1
only	1
see	1
in	1
their	1
dreams,	1
and	1
that	1
but	1
dimly;	1
but	1
the	1
like	1
of	1
whom	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
glide	1
among	1
the	1
unchanging	1
Asiatic	1
communities,	1
especially	1
the	1
Oriental	1
isles	1
to	1
the	1
east	1
of	1
the	1
continent--those	1
insulated,	1
immemorial,	1
unalterable	1
countries,	1
which	1
even	1
in	1
these	1
modern	1
days	1
still	1
preserve	1
much	1
of	1
the	1
ghostly	1
aboriginalness	1
of	1
earth's	1
primal	1
generations,	1
when	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
man	1
was	1
a	1
distinct	1
recollection,	1
and	1
all	1
men	1
his	1
descendants,	1
unknowing	1
whence	1
he	1
came,	1
eyed	1
each	1
other	1
as	1
real	1
phantoms,	1
and	1
asked	1
of	1
the	1
sun	1
and	1
the	1
moon	1
why	1
they	1
were	1
created	1
and	1
to	1
what	1
end;	1
when	1
though,	1
according	1
to	1
Genesis,	1
the	1
angels	1
indeed	1
consorted	1
with	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
men,	1
the	1
devils	1
also,	1
add	1
the	1
uncanonical	1
Rabbins,	1
indulged	1
in	1
mundane	1
amours.	1
CHAPTER	1
51	1
The	1
Spirit-Spout.	1
Days,	1
weeks	1
passed,	1
and	1
under	1
easy	1
sail,	1
the	1
ivory	1
Pequod	1
had	1
slowly	1
swept	1
across	1
four	1
several	1
cruising-grounds;	1
that	1
off	1
the	1
Azores;	1
off	1
the	1
Cape	1
de	1
Verdes;	1
on	1
the	1
Plate	1
(so	1
called),	1
being	1
off	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
Rio	1
de	1
la	1
Plata;	1
and	1
the	1
Carrol	1
Ground,	1
an	1
unstaked,	1
watery	1
locality,	1
southerly	1
from	1
St.	1
Helena.	1
It	1
was	1
while	1
gliding	1
through	1
these	1
latter	1
waters	1
that	1
one	1
serene	1
and	1
moonlight	1
night,	1
when	1
all	1
the	1
waves	1
rolled	1
by	1
like	1
scrolls	1
of	1
silver;	1
and,	1
by	1
their	1
soft,	1
suffusing	1
seethings,	1
made	1
what	1
seemed	1
a	1
silvery	1
silence,	1
not	1
a	1
solitude;	1
on	1
such	1
a	1
silent	1
night	1
a	1
silvery	1
jet	1
was	1
seen	1
far	1
in	1
advance	1
of	1
the	1
white	1
bubbles	1
at	1
the	1
bow.	1
Lit	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
moon,	1
it	1
looked	1
celestial;	1
seemed	1
some	1
plumed	1
and	1
glittering	1
god	1
uprising	1
from	1
the	1
sea.	1
Fedallah	1
first	1
descried	1
this	1
jet.	1
For	1
of	1
these	1
moonlight	1
nights,	1
it	1
was	1
his	1
wont	1
to	1
mount	1
to	1
the	1
main-mast	1
head,	1
and	1
stand	1
a	1
look-out	1
there,	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
precision	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
day.	1
And	1
yet,	1
though	1
herds	1
of	1
whales	1
were	1
seen	1
by	1
night,	1
not	1
one	1
whaleman	1
in	1
a	1
hundred	1
would	1
venture	1
a	1
lowering	1
for	1
them.	1
You	1
may	1
think	1
with	1
what	1
emotions,	1
then,	1
the	1
seamen	1
beheld	1
this	1
old	1
Oriental	1
perched	1
aloft	1
at	1
such	1
unusual	1
hours;	1
his	1
turban	1
and	1
the	1
moon,	1
companions	1
in	1
one	1
sky.	1
But	1
when,	1
after	1
spending	1
his	1
uniform	1
interval	1
there	1
for	1
several	1
successive	1
nights	1
without	1
uttering	1
a	1
single	1
sound;	1
when,	1
after	1
all	1
this	1
silence,	1
his	1
unearthly	1
voice	1
was	1
heard	1
announcing	1
that	1
silvery,	1
moon-lit	1
jet,	1
every	1
reclining	1
mariner	1
started	1
to	1
his	1
feet	1
as	1
if	1
some	1
winged	1
spirit	1
had	1
lighted	1
in	1
the	1
rigging,	1
and	1
hailed	1
the	1
mortal	1
crew.	1
"There	1
she	1
blows!"	1
Had	1
the	1
trump	1
of	1
judgment	1
blown,	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
quivered	1
more;	1
yet	1
still	1
they	1
felt	1
no	1
terror;	1
rather	1
pleasure.	1
For	1
though	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
most	1
unwonted	1
hour,	1
yet	1
so	1
impressive	1
was	1
the	1
cry,	1
and	1
so	1
deliriously	1
exciting,	1
that	1
almost	1
every	1
soul	1
on	1
board	1
instinctively	1
desired	1
a	1
lowering.	1
Walking	1
the	1
deck	1
with	1
quick,	1
side-lunging	1
strides,	1
Ahab	1
commanded	1
the	1
t'gallant	1
sails	1
and	1
royals	1
to	1
be	1
set,	1
and	1
every	1
stunsail	1
spread.	1
The	1
best	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
ship	1
must	1
take	1
the	1
helm.	1
Then,	1
with	1
every	1
mast-head	1
manned,	1
the	1
piled-up	1
craft	1
rolled	1
down	1
before	1
the	1
wind.	1
The	1
strange,	1
upheaving,	1
lifting	1
tendency	1
of	1
the	1
taffrail	1
breeze	1
filling	1
the	1
hollows	1
of	1
so	1
many	1
sails,	1
made	1
the	1
buoyant,	1
hovering	1
deck	1
to	1
feel	1
like	1
air	1
beneath	1
the	1
feet;	1
while	1
still	1
she	1
rushed	1
along,	1
as	1
if	1
two	1
antagonistic	1
influences	1
were	1
struggling	1
in	1
her--one	1
to	1
mount	1
direct	1
to	1
heaven,	1
the	1
other	1
to	1
drive	1
yawingly	1
to	1
some	1
horizontal	1
goal.	1
And	1
had	1
you	1
watched	1
Ahab's	1
face	1
that	1
night,	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
thought	1
that	1
in	1
him	1
also	1
two	1
different	1
things	1
were	1
warring.	1
While	1
his	1
one	1
live	1
leg	1
made	1
lively	1
echoes	1
along	1
the	1
deck,	1
every	1
stroke	1
of	1
his	1
dead	1
limb	1
sounded	1
like	1
a	1
coffin-tap.	1
On	1
life	1
and	1
death	1
this	1
old	1
man	1
walked.	1
But	1
though	1
the	1
ship	1
so	1
swiftly	1
sped,	1
and	1
though	1
from	1
every	1
eye,	1
like	1
arrows,	1
the	1
eager	1
glances	1
shot,	1
yet	1
the	1
silvery	1
jet	1
was	1
no	1
more	1
seen	1
that	1
night.	1
Every	1
sailor	1
swore	1
he	1
saw	1
it	1
once,	1
but	1
not	1
a	1
second	1
time.	1
This	1
midnight-spout	1
had	1
almost	1
grown	1
a	1
forgotten	1
thing,	1
when,	1
some	1
days	1
after,	1
lo!	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
silent	1
hour,	1
it	1
was	1
again	1
announced:	1
again	1
it	1
was	1
descried	1
by	1
all;	1
but	1
upon	1
making	1
sail	1
to	1
overtake	1
it,	1
once	1
more	1
it	1
disappeared	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
never	1
been.	1
And	1
so	1
it	1
served	1
us	1
night	1
after	1
night,	1
till	1
no	1
one	1
heeded	1
it	1
but	1
to	1
wonder	1
at	1
it.	1
Mysteriously	1
jetted	1
into	1
the	1
clear	1
moonlight,	1
or	1
starlight,	1
as	1
the	1
case	1
might	1
be;	1
disappearing	1
again	1
for	1
one	1
whole	1
day,	1
or	1
two	1
days,	1
or	1
three;	1
and	1
somehow	1
seeming	1
at	1
every	1
distinct	1
repetition	1
to	1
be	1
advancing	1
still	1
further	1
and	1
further	1
in	1
our	1
van,	1
this	1
solitary	1
jet	1
seemed	1
for	1
ever	1
alluring	1
us	1
on.	1
Nor	1
with	1
the	1
immemorial	1
superstition	1
of	1
their	1
race,	1
and	1
in	1
accordance	1
with	1
the	1
preternaturalness,	1
as	1
it	1
seemed,	1
which	1
in	1
many	1
things	1
invested	1
the	1
Pequod,	1
were	1
there	1
wanting	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
seamen	1
who	1
swore	1
that	1
whenever	1
and	1
wherever	1
descried;	1
at	1
however	1
remote	1
times,	1
or	1
in	1
however	1
far	1
apart	1
latitudes	1
and	1
longitudes,	1
that	1
unnearable	1
spout	1
was	1
cast	1
by	1
one	1
self-same	1
whale;	1
and	1
that	1
whale,	1
Moby	1
Dick.	1
For	1
a	1
time,	1
there	1
reigned,	1
too,	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
peculiar	1
dread	1
at	1
this	1
flitting	1
apparition,	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
treacherously	1
beckoning	1
us	1
on	1
and	1
on,	1
in	1
order	1
that	1
the	1
monster	1
might	1
turn	1
round	1
upon	1
us,	1
and	1
rend	1
us	1
at	1
last	1
in	1
the	1
remotest	1
and	1
most	1
savage	1
seas.	1
These	1
temporary	1
apprehensions,	1
so	1
vague	1
but	1
so	1
awful,	1
derived	1
a	1
wondrous	1
potency	1
from	1
the	1
contrasting	1
serenity	1
of	1
the	1
weather,	1
in	1
which,	1
beneath	1
all	1
its	1
blue	1
blandness,	1
some	1
thought	1
there	1
lurked	1
a	1
devilish	1
charm,	1
as	1
for	1
days	1
and	1
days	1
we	1
voyaged	1
along,	1
through	1
seas	1
so	1
wearily,	1
lonesomely	1
mild,	1
that	1
all	1
space,	1
in	1
repugnance	1
to	1
our	1
vengeful	1
errand,	1
seemed	1
vacating	1
itself	1
of	1
life	1
before	1
our	1
urn-like	1
prow.	1
But,	1
at	1
last,	1
when	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
eastward,	1
the	1
Cape	1
winds	1
began	1
howling	1
around	1
us,	1
and	1
we	1
rose	1
and	1
fell	1
upon	1
the	1
long,	1
troubled	1
seas	1
that	1
are	1
there;	1
when	1
the	1
ivory-tusked	1
Pequod	1
sharply	1
bowed	1
to	1
the	1
blast,	1
and	1
gored	1
the	1
dark	1
waves	1
in	1
her	1
madness,	1
till,	1
like	1
showers	1
of	1
silver	1
chips,	1
the	1
foam-flakes	1
flew	1
over	1
her	1
bulwarks;	1
then	1
all	1
this	1
desolate	1
vacuity	1
of	1
life	1
went	1
away,	1
but	1
gave	1
place	1
to	1
sights	1
more	1
dismal	1
than	1
before.	1
Close	1
to	1
our	1
bows,	1
strange	1
forms	1
in	1
the	1
water	1
darted	1
hither	1
and	1
thither	1
before	1
us;	1
while	1
thick	1
in	1
our	1
rear	1
flew	1
the	1
inscrutable	1
sea-ravens.	1
And	1
every	1
morning,	1
perched	1
on	1
our	1
stays,	1
rows	1
of	1
these	1
birds	1
were	1
seen;	1
and	1
spite	1
of	1
our	1
hootings,	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
obstinately	1
clung	1
to	1
the	1
hemp,	1
as	1
though	1
they	1
deemed	1
our	1
ship	1
some	1
drifting,	1
uninhabited	1
craft;	1
a	1
thing	1
appointed	1
to	1
desolation,	1
and	1
therefore	1
fit	1
roosting-place	1
for	1
their	1
homeless	1
selves.	1
And	1
heaved	1
and	1
heaved,	1
still	1
unrestingly	1
heaved	1
the	1
black	1
sea,	1
as	1
if	1
its	1
vast	1
tides	1
were	1
a	1
conscience;	1
and	1
the	1
great	1
mundane	1
soul	1
were	1
in	1
anguish	1
and	1
remorse	1
for	1
the	1
long	1
sin	1
and	1
suffering	1
it	1
had	1
bred.	1
Cape	1
of	1
Good	1
Hope,	1
do	1
they	1
call	1
ye?	1
Rather	1
Cape	1
Tormentoto,	1
as	1
called	1
of	1
yore;	1
for	1
long	1
allured	1
by	1
the	1
perfidious	1
silences	1
that	1
before	1
had	1
attended	1
us,	1
we	1
found	1
ourselves	1
launched	1
into	1
this	1
tormented	1
sea,	1
where	1
guilty	1
beings	1
transformed	1
into	1
those	1
fowls	1
and	1
these	1
fish,	1
seemed	1
condemned	1
to	1
swim	1
on	1
everlastingly	1
without	1
any	1
haven	1
in	1
store,	1
or	1
beat	1
that	1
black	1
air	1
without	1
any	1
horizon.	1
But	1
calm,	1
snow-white,	1
and	1
unvarying;	1
still	1
directing	1
its	1
fountain	1
of	1
feathers	1
to	1
the	1
sky;	1
still	1
beckoning	1
us	1
on	1
from	1
before,	1
the	1
solitary	1
jet	1
would	1
at	1
times	1
be	1
descried.	1
During	1
all	1
this	1
blackness	1
of	1
the	1
elements,	1
Ahab,	1
though	1
assuming	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
the	1
almost	1
continual	1
command	1
of	1
the	1
drenched	1
and	1
dangerous	1
deck,	1
manifested	1
the	1
gloomiest	1
reserve;	1
and	1
more	1
seldom	1
than	1
ever	1
addressed	1
his	1
mates.	1
In	1
tempestuous	1
times	1
like	1
these,	1
after	1
everything	1
above	1
and	1
aloft	1
has	1
been	1
secured,	1
nothing	1
more	1
can	1
be	1
done	1
but	1
passively	1
to	1
await	1
the	1
issue	1
of	1
the	1
gale.	1
Then	1
Captain	1
and	1
crew	1
become	1
practical	1
fatalists.	1
So,	1
with	1
his	1
ivory	1
leg	1
inserted	1
into	1
its	1
accustomed	1
hole,	1
and	1
with	1
one	1
hand	1
firmly	1
grasping	1
a	1
shroud,	1
Ahab	1
for	1
hours	1
and	1
hours	1
would	1
stand	1
gazing	1
dead	1
to	1
windward,	1
while	1
an	1
occasional	1
squall	1
of	1
sleet	1
or	1
snow	1
would	1
all	1
but	1
congeal	1
his	1
very	1
eyelashes	1
together.	1
Meantime,	1
the	1
crew	1
driven	1
from	1
the	1
forward	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
ship	1
by	1
the	1
perilous	1
seas	1
that	1
burstingly	1
broke	1
over	1
its	1
bows,	1
stood	1
in	1
a	1
line	1
along	1
the	1
bulwarks	1
in	1
the	1
waist;	1
and	1
the	1
better	1
to	1
guard	1
against	1
the	1
leaping	1
waves,	1
each	1
man	1
had	1
slipped	1
himself	1
into	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
bowline	1
secured	1
to	1
the	1
rail,	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
swung	1
as	1
in	1
a	1
loosened	1
belt.	1
Few	1
or	1
no	1
words	1
were	1
spoken;	1
and	1
the	1
silent	1
ship,	1
as	1
if	1
manned	1
by	1
painted	1
sailors	1
in	1
wax,	1
day	1
after	1
day	1
tore	1
on	1
through	1
all	1
the	1
swift	1
madness	1
and	1
gladness	1
of	1
the	1
demoniac	1
waves.	1
By	1
night	1
the	1
same	1
muteness	1
of	1
humanity	1
before	1
the	1
shrieks	1
of	1
the	1
ocean	1
prevailed;	1
still	1
in	1
silence	1
the	1
men	1
swung	1
in	1
the	1
bowlines;	1
still	1
wordless	1
Ahab	1
stood	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
blast.	1
Even	1
when	1
wearied	1
nature	1
seemed	1
demanding	1
repose	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
seek	1
that	1
repose	1
in	1
his	1
hammock.	1
Never	1
could	1
Starbuck	1
forget	1
the	1
old	1
man's	1
aspect,	1
when	1
one	1
night	1
going	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
cabin	1
to	1
mark	1
how	1
the	1
barometer	1
stood,	1
he	1
saw	1
him	1
with	1
closed	1
eyes	1
sitting	1
straight	1
in	1
his	1
floor-screwed	1
chair;	1
the	1
rain	1
and	1
half-melted	1
sleet	1
of	1
the	1
storm	1
from	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
some	1
time	1
before	1
emerged,	1
still	1
slowly	1
dripping	1
from	1
the	1
unremoved	1
hat	1
and	1
coat.	1
On	1
the	1
table	1
beside	1
him	1
lay	1
unrolled	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
charts	1
of	1
tides	1
and	1
currents	1
which	1
have	1
previously	1
been	1
spoken	1
of.	1
His	1
lantern	1
swung	1
from	1
his	1
tightly	1
clenched	1
hand.	1
Though	1
the	1
body	1
was	1
erect,	1
the	1
head	1
was	1
thrown	1
back	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
closed	1
eyes	1
were	1
pointed	1
towards	1
the	1
needle	1
of	1
the	1
tell-tale	1
that	1
swung	1
from	1
a	1
beam	1
in	1
the	1
ceiling.*	1
*The	1
cabin-compass	1
is	1
called	1
the	1
tell-tale,	1
because	1
without	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
compass	1
at	1
the	1
helm,	1
the	1
Captain,	1
while	1
below,	1
can	1
inform	1
himself	1
of	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
the	1
ship.	1
Terrible	1
old	1
man!	1
thought	1
Starbuck	1
with	1
a	1
shudder,	1
sleeping	1
in	1
this	1
gale,	1
still	1
thou	1
steadfastly	1
eyest	1
thy	1
purpose.	1
CHAPTER	1
52	1
The	1
Albatross.	1
South-eastward	1
from	1
the	1
Cape,	1
off	1
the	1
distant	1
Crozetts,	1
a	1
good	1
cruising	1
ground	1
for	1
Right	1
Whalemen,	1
a	1
sail	1
loomed	1
ahead,	1
the	1
Goney	1
(Albatross)	1
by	1
name.	1
As	1
she	1
slowly	1
drew	1
nigh,	1
from	1
my	1
lofty	1
perch	1
at	1
the	1
fore-mast-head,	1
I	1
had	1
a	1
good	1
view	1
of	1
that	1
sight	1
so	1
remarkable	1
to	1
a	1
tyro	1
in	1
the	1
far	1
ocean	1
fisheries--a	1
whaler	1
at	1
sea,	1
and	1
long	1
absent	1
from	1
home.	1
As	1
if	1
the	1
waves	1
had	1
been	1
fullers,	1
this	1
craft	1
was	1
bleached	1
like	1
the	1
skeleton	1
of	1
a	1
stranded	1
walrus.	1
All	1
down	1
her	1
sides,	1
this	1
spectral	1
appearance	1
was	1
traced	1
with	1
long	1
channels	1
of	1
reddened	1
rust,	1
while	1
all	1
her	1
spars	1
and	1
her	1
rigging	1
were	1
like	1
the	1
thick	1
branches	1
of	1
trees	1
furred	1
over	1
with	1
hoar-frost.	1
Only	1
her	1
lower	1
sails	1
were	1
set.	1
A	1
wild	1
sight	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
long-bearded	1
look-outs	1
at	1
those	1
three	1
mast-heads.	1
They	1
seemed	1
clad	1
in	1
the	1
skins	1
of	1
beasts,	1
so	1
torn	1
and	1
bepatched	1
the	1
raiment	1
that	1
had	1
survived	1
nearly	1
four	1
years	1
of	1
cruising.	1
Standing	1
in	1
iron	1
hoops	1
nailed	1
to	1
the	1
mast,	1
they	1
swayed	1
and	1
swung	1
over	1
a	1
fathomless	1
sea;	1
and	1
though,	1
when	1
the	1
ship	1
slowly	1
glided	1
close	1
under	1
our	1
stern,	1
we	1
six	1
men	1
in	1
the	1
air	1
came	1
so	1
nigh	1
to	1
each	1
other	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
almost	1
have	1
leaped	1
from	1
the	1
mast-heads	1
of	1
one	1
ship	1
to	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
other;	1
yet,	1
those	1
forlorn-looking	1
fishermen,	1
mildly	1
eyeing	1
us	1
as	1
they	1
passed,	1
said	1
not	1
one	1
word	1
to	1
our	1
own	1
look-outs,	1
while	1
the	1
quarter-deck	1
hail	1
was	1
being	1
heard	1
from	1
below.	1
"Ship	1
ahoy!	1
Have	1
ye	1
seen	1
the	1
White	1
Whale?"	1
But	1
as	1
the	1
strange	1
captain,	1
leaning	1
over	1
the	1
pallid	1
bulwarks,	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
act	1
of	1
putting	1
his	1
trumpet	1
to	1
his	1
mouth,	1
it	1
somehow	1
fell	1
from	1
his	1
hand	1
into	1
the	1
sea;	1
and	1
the	1
wind	1
now	1
rising	1
amain,	1
he	1
in	1
vain	1
strove	1
to	1
make	1
himself	1
heard	1
without	1
it.	1
Meantime	1
his	1
ship	1
was	1
still	1
increasing	1
the	1
distance	1
between.	1
While	1
in	1
various	1
silent	1
ways	1
the	1
seamen	1
of	1
the	1
Pequod	1
were	1
evincing	1
their	1
observance	1
of	1
this	1
ominous	1
incident	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
mere	1
mention	1
of	1
the	1
White	1
Whale's	1
name	1
to	1
another	1
ship,	1
Ahab	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
paused;	1
it	1
almost	1
seemed	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
lowered	1
a	1
boat	1
to	1
board	1
the	1
stranger,	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
threatening	1
wind	1
forbade.	1
But	1
taking	1
advantage	1
of	1
his	1
windward	1
position,	1
he	1
again	1
seized	1
his	1
trumpet,	1
and	1
knowing	1
by	1
her	1
aspect	1
that	1
the	1
stranger	1
vessel	1
was	1
a	1
Nantucketer	1
and	1
shortly	1
bound	1
home,	1
he	1
loudly	1
hailed--"Ahoy	1
there!	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
Pequod,	1
bound	1
round	1
the	1
world!	1
Tell	1
them	1
to	1
address	1
all	1
future	1
letters	1
to	1
the	1
Pacific	1
ocean!	1
and	1
this	1
time	1
three	1
years,	1
if	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
at	1
home,	1
tell	1
them	1
to	1
address	1
them	1
to--"	1
At	1
that	1
moment	1
the	1
two	1
wakes	1
were	1
fairly	1
crossed,	1
and	1
instantly,	1
then,	1
in	1
accordance	1
with	1
their	1
singular	1
ways,	1
shoals	1
of	1
small	1
harmless	1
fish,	1
that	1
for	1
some	1
days	1
before	1
had	1
been	1
placidly	1
swimming	1
by	1
our	1
side,	1
darted	1
away	1
with	1
what	1
seemed	1
shuddering	1
fins,	1
and	1
ranged	1
themselves	1
fore	1
and	1
aft	1
with	1
the	1
stranger's	1
flanks.	1
Though	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
his	1
continual	1
voyagings	1
Ahab	1
must	1
often	1
before	1
have	1
noticed	1
a	1
similar	1
sight,	1
yet,	1
to	1
any	1
monomaniac	1
man,	1
the	1
veriest	1
trifles	1
capriciously	1
carry	1
meanings.	1
"Swim	1
away	1
from	1
me,	1
do	1
ye?"	1
murmured	1
Ahab,	1
gazing	1
over	1
into	1
the	1
water.	1
There	1
seemed	1
but	1
little	1
in	1
the	1
words,	1
but	1
the	1
tone	1
conveyed	1
more	1
of	1
deep	1
helpless	1
sadness	1
than	1
the	1
insane	1
old	1
man	1
had	1
ever	1
before	1
evinced.	1
But	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
steersman,	1
who	1
thus	1
far	1
had	1
been	1
holding	1
the	1
ship	1
in	1
the	1
wind	1
to	1
diminish	1
her	1
headway,	1
he	1
cried	1
out	1
in	1
his	1
old	1
lion	1
voice,--"Up	1
helm!	1
Keep	1
her	1
off	1
round	1
the	1
world!"	1
Round	1
the	1
world!	1
There	1
is	1
much	1
in	1
that	1
sound	1
to	1
inspire	1
proud	1
feelings;	1
but	1
whereto	1
does	1
all	1
that	1
circumnavigation	1
conduct?	1
Only	1
through	1
numberless	1
perils	1
to	1
the	1
very	1
point	1
whence	1
we	1
started,	1
where	1
those	1
that	1
we	1
left	1
behind	1
secure,	1
were	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
before	1
us.	1
Were	1
this	1
world	1
an	1
endless	1
plain,	1
and	1
by	1
sailing	1
eastward	1
we	1
could	1
for	1
ever	1
reach	1
new	1
distances,	1
and	1
discover	1
sights	1
more	1
sweet	1
and	1
strange	1
than	1
any	1
Cyclades	1
or	1
Islands	1
of	1
King	1
Solomon,	1
then	1
there	1
were	1
promise	1
in	1
the	1
voyage.	1
But	1
in	1
pursuit	1
of	1
those	1
far	1
mysteries	1
we	1
dream	1
of,	1
or	1
in	1
tormented	1
chase	1
of	1
that	1
demon	1
phantom	1
that,	1
some	1
time	1
or	1
other,	1
swims	1
before	1
all	1
human	1
hearts;	1
while	1
chasing	1
such	1
over	1
this	1
round	1
globe,	1
they	1
either	1
lead	1
us	1
on	1
in	1
barren	1
mazes	1
or	1
midway	1
leave	1
us	1
whelmed.	1
CHAPTER	1
53	1
The	1
Gam.	1
The	1
ostensible	1
reason	1
why	1
Ahab	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
on	1
board	1
of	1
the	1
whaler	1
we	1
had	1
spoken	1
was	1
this:	1
the	1
wind	1
and	1
sea	1
betokened	1
storms.	1
But	1
even	1
had	1
this	1
not	1
been	1
the	1
case,	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
after	1
all,	1
perhaps,	1
have	1
boarded	1
her--judging	1
by	1
his	1
subsequent	1
conduct	1
on	1
similar	1
occasions--if	1
so	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
that,	1
by	1
the	1
process	1
of	1
hailing,	1
he	1
had	1
obtained	1
a	1
negative	1
answer	1
to	1
the	1
question	1
he	1
put.	1
For,	1
as	1
it	1
eventually	1
turned	1
out,	1
he	1
cared	1
not	1
to	1
consort,	1
even	1
for	1
five	1
minutes,	1
with	1
any	1
stranger	1
captain,	1
except	1
he	1
could	1
contribute	1
some	1
of	1
that	1
information	1
he	1
so	1
absorbingly	1
sought.	1
But	1
all	1
this	1
might	1
remain	1
inadequately	1
estimated,	1
were	1
not	1
something	1
said	1
here	1
of	1
the	1
peculiar	1
usages	1
of	1
whaling-vessels	1
when	1
meeting	1
each	1
other	1
in	1
foreign	1
seas,	1
and	1
especially	1
on	1
a	1
common	1
cruising-ground.	1
If	1
two	1
strangers	1
crossing	1
the	1
Pine	1
Barrens	1
in	1
New	1
York	1
State,	1
or	1
the	1
equally	1
desolate	1
Salisbury	1
Plain	1
in	1
England;	1
if	1
casually	1
encountering	1
each	1
other	1
in	1
such	1
inhospitable	1
wilds,	1
these	1
twain,	1
for	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
them,	1
cannot	1
well	1
avoid	1
a	1
mutual	1
salutation;	1
and	1
stopping	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
to	1
interchange	1
the	1
news;	1
and,	1
perhaps,	1
sitting	1
down	1
for	1
a	1
while	1
and	1
resting	1
in	1
concert:	1
then,	1
how	1
much	1
more	1
natural	1
that	1
upon	1
the	1
illimitable	1
Pine	1
Barrens	1
and	1
Salisbury	1
Plains	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
two	1
whaling	1
vessels	1
descrying	1
each	1
other	1
at	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
earth--off	1
lone	1
Fanning's	1
Island,	1
or	1
the	1
far	1
away	1
King's	1
Mills;	1
how	1
much	1
more	1
natural,	1
I	1
say,	1
that	1
under	1
such	1
circumstances	1
these	1
ships	1
should	1
not	1
only	1
interchange	1
hails,	1
but	1
come	1
into	1
still	1
closer,	1
more	1
friendly	1
and	1
sociable	1
contact.	1
And	1
especially	1
would	1
this	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
course,	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
vessels	1
owned	1
in	1
one	1
seaport,	1
and	1
whose	1
captains,	1
officers,	1
and	1
not	1
a	1
few	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
are	1
personally	1
known	1
to	1
each	1
other;	1
and	1
consequently,	1
have	1
all	1
sorts	1
of	1
dear	1
domestic	1
things	1
to	1
talk	1
about.	1
For	1
the	1
long	1
absent	1
ship,	1
the	1
outward-bounder,	1
perhaps,	1
has	1
letters	1
on	1
board;	1
at	1
any	1
rate,	1
she	1
will	1
be	1
sure	1
to	1
let	1
her	1
have	1
some	1
papers	1
of	1
a	1
date	1
a	1
year	1
or	1
two	1
later	1
than	1
the	1
last	1
one	1
on	1
her	1
blurred	1
and	1
thumb-worn	1
files.	1
And	1
in	1
return	1
for	1
that	1
courtesy,	1
the	1
outward-bound	1
ship	1
would	1
receive	1
the	1
latest	1
whaling	1
intelligence	1
from	1
the	1
cruising-ground	1
to	1
which	1
she	1
may	1
be	1
destined,	1
a	1
thing	1
of	1
the	1
utmost	1
importance	1
to	1
her.	1
And	1
in	1
degree,	1
all	1
this	1
will	1
hold	1
true	1
concerning	1
whaling	1
vessels	1
crossing	1
each	1
other's	1
track	1
on	1
the	1
cruising-ground	1
itself,	1
even	1
though	1
they	1
are	1
equally	1
long	1
absent	1
from	1
home.	1
For	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
may	1
have	1
received	1
a	1
transfer	1
of	1
letters	1
from	1
some	1
third,	1
and	1
now	1
far	1
remote	1
vessel;	1
and	1
some	1
of	1
those	1
letters	1
may	1
be	1
for	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
ship	1
she	1
now	1
meets.	1
Besides,	1
they	1
would	1
exchange	1
the	1
whaling	1
news,	1
and	1
have	1
an	1
agreeable	1
chat.	1
For	1
not	1
only	1
would	1
they	1
meet	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
sympathies	1
of	1
sailors,	1
but	1
likewise	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
peculiar	1
congenialities	1
arising	1
from	1
a	1
common	1
pursuit	1
and	1
mutually	1
shared	1
privations	1
and	1
perils.	1
Nor	1
would	1
difference	1
of	1
country	1
make	1
any	1
very	1
essential	1
difference;	1
that	1
is,	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
both	1
parties	1
speak	1
one	1
language,	1
as	1
is	1
the	1
case	1
with	1
Americans	1
and	1
English.	1
Though,	1
to	1
be	1
sure,	1
from	1
the	1
small	1
number	1
of	1
English	1
whalers,	1
such	1
meetings	1
do	1
not	1
very	1
often	1
occur,	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
do	1
occur	1
there	1
is	1
too	1
apt	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
shyness	1
between	1
them;	1
for	1
your	1
Englishman	1
is	1
rather	1
reserved,	1
and	1
your	1
Yankee,	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
fancy	1
that	1
sort	1
of	1
thing	1
in	1
anybody	1
but	1
himself.	1
Besides,	1
the	1
English	1
whalers	1
sometimes	1
affect	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
metropolitan	1
superiority	1
over	1
the	1
American	1
whalers;	1
regarding	1
the	1
long,	1
lean	1
Nantucketer,	1
with	1
his	1
nondescript	1
provincialisms,	1
as	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
sea-peasant.	1
But	1
where	1
this	1
superiority	1
in	1
the	1
English	1
whalemen	1
does	1
really	1
consist,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
hard	1
to	1
say,	1
seeing	1
that	1
the	1
Yankees	1
in	1
one	1
day,	1
collectively,	1
kill	1
more	1
whales	1
than	1
all	1
the	1
English,	1
collectively,	1
in	1
ten	1
years.	1
But	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
harmless	1
little	1
foible	1
in	1
the	1
English	1
whale-hunters,	1
which	1
the	1
Nantucketer	1
does	1
not	1
take	1
much	1
to	1
heart;	1
probably,	1
because	1
he	1
knows	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
a	1
few	1
foibles	1
himself.	1
So,	1
then,	1
we	1
see	1
that	1
of	1
all	1
ships	1
separately	1
sailing	1
the	1
sea,	1
the	1
whalers	1
have	1
most	1
reason	1
to	1
be	1
sociable--and	1
they	1
are	1
so.	1
Whereas,	1
some	1
merchant	1
ships	1
crossing	1
each	1
other's	1
wake	1
in	1
the	1
mid-Atlantic,	1
will	1
oftentimes	1
pass	1
on	1
without	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
a	1
single	1
word	1
of	1
recognition,	1
mutually	1
cutting	1
each	1
other	1
on	1
the	1
high	1
seas,	1
like	1
a	1
brace	1
of	1
dandies	1
in	1
Broadway;	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
indulging,	1
perhaps,	1
in	1
finical	1
criticism	1
upon	1
each	1
other's	1
rig.	1
As	1
for	1
Men-of-War,	1
when	1
they	1
chance	1
to	1
meet	1
at	1
sea,	1
they	1
first	1
go	1
through	1
such	1
a	1
string	1
of	1
silly	1
bowings	1
and	1
scrapings,	1
such	1
a	1
ducking	1
of	1
ensigns,	1
that	1
there	1
does	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
much	1
right-down	1
hearty	1
good-will	1
and	1
brotherly	1
love	1
about	1
it	1
at	1
all.	1
As	1
touching	1
Slave-ships	1
meeting,	1
why,	1
they	1
are	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
prodigious	1
hurry,	1
they	1
run	1
away	1
from	1
each	1
other	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
possible.	1
And	1
as	1
for	1
Pirates,	1
when	1
they	1
chance	1
to	1
cross	1
each	1
other's	1
cross-bones,	1
the	1
first	1
hail	1
is--"How	1
many	1
skulls?"--the	1
same	1
way	1
that	1
whalers	1
hail--"How	1
many	1
barrels?"	1
And	1
that	1
question	1
once	1
answered,	1
pirates	1
straightway	1
steer	1
apart,	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
infernal	1
villains	1
on	1
both	1
sides,	1
and	1
don't	1
like	1
to	1
see	1
overmuch	1
of	1
each	1
other's	1
villanous	1
likenesses.	1
But	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
godly,	1
honest,	1
unostentatious,	1
hospitable,	1
sociable,	1
free-and-easy	1
whaler!	1
What	1
does	1
the	1
whaler	1
do	1
when	1
she	1
meets	1
another	1
whaler	1
in	1
any	1
sort	1
of	1
decent	1
weather?	1
She	1
has	1
a	1
"GAM,"	1
a	1
thing	1
so	1
utterly	1
unknown	1
to	1
all	1
other	1
ships	1
that	1
they	1
never	1
heard	1
of	1
the	1
name	1
even;	1
and	1
if	1
by	1
chance	1
they	1
should	1
hear	1
of	1
it,	1
they	1
only	1
grin	1
at	1
it,	1
and	1
repeat	1
gamesome	1
stuff	1
about	1
"spouters"	1
and	1
"blubber-boilers,"	1
and	1
such	1
like	1
pretty	1
exclamations.	1
Why	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
all	1
Merchant-seamen,	1
and	1
also	1
all	1
Pirates	1
and	1
Man-of-War's	1
men,	1
and	1
Slave-ship	1
sailors,	1
cherish	1
such	1
a	1
scornful	1
feeling	1
towards	1
Whale-ships;	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
question	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
hard	1
to	1
answer.	1
Because,	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
pirates,	1
say,	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
know	1
whether	1
that	1
profession	1
of	1
theirs	1
has	1
any	1
peculiar	1
glory	1
about	1
it.	1
It	1
sometimes	1
ends	1
in	1
uncommon	1
elevation,	1
indeed;	1
but	1
only	1
at	1
the	1
gallows.	1
And	1
besides,	1
when	1
a	1
man	1
is	1
elevated	1
in	1
that	1
odd	1
fashion,	1
he	1
has	1
no	1
proper	1
foundation	1
for	1
his	1
superior	1
altitude.	1
Hence,	1
I	1
conclude,	1
that	1
in	1
boasting	1
himself	1
to	1
be	1
high	1
lifted	1
above	1
a	1
whaleman,	1
in	1
that	1
assertion	1
the	1
pirate	1
has	1
no	1
solid	1
basis	1
to	1
stand	1
on.	1
But	1
what	1
is	1
a	1
GAM?	1
You	1
might	1
wear	1
out	1
your	1
index-finger	1
running	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
columns	1
of	1
dictionaries,	1
and	1
never	1
find	1
the	1
word.	1
Dr.	1
Johnson	1
never	1
attained	1
to	1
that	1
erudition;	1
Noah	1
Webster's	1
ark	1
does	1
not	1
hold	1
it.	1
Nevertheless,	1
this	1
same	1
expressive	1
word	1
has	1
now	1
for	1
many	1
years	1
been	1
in	1
constant	1
use	1
among	1
some	1
fifteen	1
thousand	1
true	1
born	1
Yankees.	1
Certainly,	1
it	1
needs	1
a	1
definition,	1
and	1
should	1
be	1
incorporated	1
into	1
the	1
Lexicon.	1
With	1
that	1
view,	1
let	1
me	1
learnedly	1
define	1
it.	1
GAM.	1
NOUN--A	1
SOCIAL	1
MEETING	1
OF	1
TWO	1
(OR	1
MORE)	1
WHALESHIPS,	1
GENERALLY	1
ON	1
A	1
CRUISING-GROUND;	1
WHEN,	1
AFTER	1
EXCHANGING	1
HAILS,	1
THEY	1
EXCHANGE	1
VISITS	1
BY	1
BOATS'	1
CREWS;	1
THE	1
TWO	1
CAPTAINS	1
REMAINING,	1
FOR	1
THE	1
TIME,	1
ON	1
BOARD	1
OF	1
ONE	1
SHIP,	1
AND	1
THE	1
TWO	1
CHIEF	1
MATES	1
ON	1
THE	1
OTHER.	1
There	1
is	1
another	1
little	1
item	1
about	1
Gamming	1
which	1
must	1
not	1
be	1
forgotten	1
here.	1
All	1
professions	1
have	1
their	1
own	1
little	1
peculiarities	1
of	1
detail;	1
so	1
has	1
the	1
whale	1
fishery.	1
In	1
a	1
pirate,	1
man-of-war,	1
or	1
slave	1
ship,	1
when	1
the	1
captain	1
is	1
rowed	1
anywhere	1
in	1
his	1
boat,	1
he	1
always	1
sits	1
in	1
the	1
stern	1
sheets	1
on	1
a	1
comfortable,	1
sometimes	1
cushioned	1
seat	1
there,	1
and	1
often	1
steers	1
himself	1
with	1
a	1
pretty	1
little	1
milliner's	1
tiller	1
decorated	1
with	1
gay	1
cords	1
and	1
ribbons.	1
But	1
the	1
whale-boat	1
has	1
no	1
seat	1
astern,	1
no	1
sofa	1
of	1
that	1
sort	1
whatever,	1
and	1
no	1
tiller	1
at	1
all.	1
High	1
times	1
indeed,	1
if	1
whaling	1
captains	1
were	1
wheeled	1
about	1
the	1
water	1
on	1
castors	1
like	1
gouty	1
old	1
aldermen	1
in	1
patent	1
chairs.	1
And	1
as	1
for	1
a	1
tiller,	1
the	1
whale-boat	1
never	1
admits	1
of	1
any	1
such	1
effeminacy;	1
and	1
therefore	1
as	1
in	1
gamming	1
a	1
complete	1
boat's	1
crew	1
must	1
leave	1
the	1
ship,	1
and	1
hence	1
as	1
the	1
boat	1
steerer	1
or	1
harpooneer	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
number,	1
that	1
subordinate	1
is	1
the	1
steersman	1
upon	1
the	1
occasion,	1
and	1
the	1
captain,	1
having	1
no	1
place	1
to	1
sit	1
in,	1
is	1
pulled	1
off	1
to	1
his	1
visit	1
all	1
standing	1
like	1
a	1
pine	1
tree.	1
And	1
often	1
you	1
will	1
notice	1
that	1
being	1
conscious	1
of	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
visible	1
world	1
resting	1
on	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
ships,	1
this	1
standing	1
captain	1
is	1
all	1
alive	1
to	1
the	1
importance	1
of	1
sustaining	1
his	1
dignity	1
by	1
maintaining	1
his	1
legs.	1
Nor	1
is	1
this	1
any	1
very	1
easy	1
matter;	1
for	1
in	1
his	1
rear	1
is	1
the	1
immense	1
projecting	1
steering	1
oar	1
hitting	1
him	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
in	1
the	1
small	1
of	1
his	1
back,	1
the	1
after-oar	1
reciprocating	1
by	1
rapping	1
his	1
knees	1
in	1
front.	1
He	1
is	1
thus	1
completely	1
wedged	1
before	1
and	1
behind,	1
and	1
can	1
only	1
expand	1
himself	1
sideways	1
by	1
settling	1
down	1
on	1
his	1
stretched	1
legs;	1
but	1
a	1
sudden,	1
violent	1
pitch	1
of	1
the	1
boat	1
will	1
often	1
go	1
far	1
to	1
topple	1
him,	1
because	1
length	1
of	1
foundation	1
is	1
nothing	1
without	1
corresponding	1
breadth.	1
Merely	1
make	1
a	1
spread	1
angle	1
of	1
two	1
poles,	1
and	1
you	1
cannot	1
stand	1
them	1
up.	1
Then,	1
again,	1
it	1
would	1
never	1
do	1
in	1
plain	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
world's	1
riveted	1
eyes,	1
it	1
would	1
never	1
do,	1
I	1
say,	1
for	1
this	1
straddling	1
captain	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
steadying	1
himself	1
the	1
slightest	1
particle	1
by	1
catching	1
hold	1
of	1
anything	1
with	1
his	1
hands;	1
indeed,	1
as	1
token	1
of	1
his	1
entire,	1
buoyant	1
self-command,	1
he	1
generally	1
carries	1
his	1
hands	1
in	1
his	1
trowsers'	1
pockets;	1
but	1
perhaps	1
being	1
generally	1
very	1
large,	1
heavy	1
hands,	1
he	1
carries	1
them	1
there	1
for	1
ballast.	1
Nevertheless	1
there	1
have	1
occurred	1
instances,	1
well	1
authenticated	1
ones	1
too,	1
where	1
the	1
captain	1
has	1
been	1
known	1
for	1
an	1
uncommonly	1
critical	1
moment	1
or	1
two,	1
in	1
a	1
sudden	1
squall	1
say--to	1
seize	1
hold	1
of	1
the	1
nearest	1
oarsman's	1
hair,	1
and	1
hold	1
on	1
there	1
like	1
grim	1
death.	1
CHAPTER	1
54	1
The	1
Town-Ho's	1
Story.	1
(AS	1
TOLD	1
AT	1
THE	1
GOLDEN	1
INN)	1
The	1
Cape	1
of	1
Good	1
Hope,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
watery	1
region	1
round	1
about	1
there,	1
is	1
much	1
like	1
some	1
noted	1
four	1
corners	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
highway,	1
where	1
you	1
meet	1
more	1
travellers	1
than	1
in	1
any	1
other	1
part.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
very	1
long	1
after	1
speaking	1
the	1
Goney	1
that	1
another	1
homeward-bound	1
whaleman,	1
the	1
Town-Ho,*	1
was	1
encountered.	1
She	1
was	1
manned	1
almost	1
wholly	1
by	1
Polynesians.	1
In	1
the	1
short	1
gam	1
that	1
ensued	1
she	1
gave	1
us	1
strong	1
news	1
of	1
Moby	1
Dick.	1
To	1
some	1
the	1
general	1
interest	1
in	1
the	1
White	1
Whale	1
was	1
now	1
wildly	1
heightened	1
by	1
a	1
circumstance	1
of	1
the	1
Town-Ho's	1
story,	1
which	1
seemed	1
obscurely	1
to	1
involve	1
with	1
the	1
whale	1
a	1
certain	1
wondrous,	1
inverted	1
visitation	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
so	1
called	1
judgments	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
at	1
times	1
are	1
said	1
to	1
overtake	1
some	1
men.	1
This	1
latter	1
circumstance,	1
with	1
its	1
own	1
particular	1
accompaniments,	1
forming	1
what	1
may	1
be	1
called	1
the	1
secret	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
tragedy	1
about	1
to	1
be	1
narrated,	1
never	1
reached	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
Captain	1
Ahab	1
or	1
his	1
mates.	1
For	1
that	1
secret	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
story	1
was	1
unknown	1
to	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
Town-Ho	1
himself.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
private	1
property	1
of	1
three	1
confederate	1
white	1
seamen	1
of	1
that	1
ship,	1
one	1
of	1
whom,	1
it	1
seems,	1
communicated	1
it	1
to	1
Tashtego	1
with	1
Romish	1
injunctions	1
of	1
secrecy,	1
but	1
the	1
following	1
night	1
Tashtego	1
rambled	1
in	1
his	1
sleep,	1
and	1
revealed	1
so	1
much	1
of	1
it	1
in	1
that	1
way,	1
that	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
wakened	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
well	1
withhold	1
the	1
rest.	1
Nevertheless,	1
so	1
potent	1
an	1
influence	1
did	1
this	1
thing	1
have	1
on	1
those	1
seamen	1
in	1
the	1
Pequod	1
who	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
full	1
knowledge	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
by	1
such	1
a	1
strange	1
delicacy,	1
to	1
call	1
it	1
so,	1
were	1
they	1
governed	1
in	1
this	1
matter,	1
that	1
they	1
kept	1
the	1
secret	1
among	1
themselves	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
never	1

abaft	1
the	1
Pequod's	1
main-mast.	1
Interweaving	1
in	1
its	1
proper	1
place	1
this	1
darker	1
thread	1
with	1
the	1
story	1
as	1
publicly	1
narrated	1
on	1
the	1
ship,	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
this	1
strange	1
affair	1
I	1
now	1
proceed	1
to	1
put	1
on	1
lasting	1
record.	1
*The	1
ancient	1
whale-cry	1
upon	1
first	1
sighting	1
a	1
whale	1
from	1
the	1
mast-head,	1
still	1
used	1
by	1
whalemen	1
in	1
hunting	1
the	1
famous	1
Gallipagos	1
terrapin.	1
For	1
my	1
humor's	1
sake,	1
I	1
shall	1
preserve	1
the	1
style	1
in	1
which	1
I	1
once	1
narrated	1
it	1
at	1
Lima,	1
to	1
a	1
lounging	1
circle	1
of	1
my	1
Spanish	1
friends,	1
one	1
saint's	1
eve,	1
smoking	1
upon	1
the	1
thick-gilt	1
tiled	1
piazza	1
of	1
the	1
Golden	1
Inn.	1
Of	1
those	1
fine	1
cavaliers,	1
the	1
young	1
Dons,	1
Pedro	1
and	1
Sebastian,	1
were	1
on	1
the	1
closer	1
terms	1
with	1
me;	1
and	1
hence	1
the	1
interluding	1
questions	1
they	1
occasionally	1
put,	1
and	1
which	1
are	1
duly	1
answered	1
at	1
the	1
time.	1
"Some	1
two	1
years	1
prior	1
to	1
my	1
first	1
learning	1
the	1
events	1
which	1
I	1
am	1
about	1
rehearsing	1
to	1
you,	1
gentlemen,	1
the	1
Town-Ho,	1
Sperm	1
Whaler	1
of	1
Nantucket,	1
was	1
cruising	1
in	1
your	1
Pacific	1
here,	1
not	1
very	1
many	1
days'	1
sail	1
eastward	1
from	1
the	1
eaves	1
of	1
this	1
good	1
Golden	1
Inn.	1
She	1
was	1
somewhere	1
to	1
the	1
northward	1
of	1
the	1
Line.	1
One	1
morning	1
upon	1
handling	1
the	1
pumps,	1
according	1
to	1
daily	1
usage,	1
it	1
was	1
observed	1
that	1
she	1
made	1
more	1
water	1
in	1
her	1
hold	1
than	1
common.	1
They	1
supposed	1
a	1
sword-fish	1
had	1
stabbed	1
her,	1
gentlemen.	1
But	1
the	1
captain,	1
having	1
some	1
unusual	1
reason	1
for	1
believing	1
that	1
rare	1
good	1
luck	1
awaited	1
him	1
in	1
those	1
latitudes;	1
and	1
therefore	1
being	1
very	1
averse	1
to	1
quit	1
them,	1
and	1
the	1
leak	1
not	1
being	1
then	1
considered	1
at	1
all	1
dangerous,	1
though,	1
indeed,	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
find	1
it	1
after	1
searching	1
the	1
hold	1
as	1
low	1
down	1
as	1
was	1
possible	1
in	1
rather	1
heavy	1
weather,	1
the	1
ship	1
still	1
continued	1
her	1
cruisings,	1
the	1
mariners	1
working	1
at	1
the	1
pumps	1
at	1
wide	1
and	1
easy	1
intervals;	1
but	1
no	1
good	1
luck	1
came;	1
more	1
days	1
went	1
by,	1
and	1
not	1
only	1
was	1
the	1
leak	1
yet	1
undiscovered,	1
but	1
it	1
sensibly	1
increased.	1
So	1
much	1
so,	1
that	1
now	1
taking	1
some	1
alarm,	1
the	1
captain,	1
making	1
all	1
sail,	1
stood	1
away	1
for	1
the	1
nearest	1
harbor	1
among	1
the	1
islands,	1
there	1
to	1
have	1
his	1
hull	1
hove	1
out	1
and	1
repaired.	1
"Though	1
no	1
small	1
passage	1
was	1
before	1
her,	1
yet,	1
if	1
the	1
commonest	1
chance	1
favoured,	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
fear	1
that	1
his	1
ship	1
would	1
founder	1
by	1
the	1
way,	1
because	1
his	1
pumps	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
best,	1
and	1
being	1
periodically	1
relieved	1
at	1
them,	1
those	1
six-and-thirty	1
men	1
of	1
his	1
could	1
easily	1
keep	1
the	1
ship	1
free;	1
never	1
mind	1
if	1
the	1
leak	1
should	1
double	1
on	1
her.	1
In	1
truth,	1
well	1
nigh	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
this	1
passage	1
being	1
attended	1
by	1
very	1
prosperous	1
breezes,	1
the	1
Town-Ho	1
had	1
all	1
but	1
certainly	1
arrived	1
in	1
perfect	1
safety	1
at	1
her	1
port	1
without	1
the	1
occurrence	1
of	1
the	1
least	1
fatality,	1
had	1
it	1
not	1
been	1
for	1
the	1
brutal	1
overbearing	1
of	1
Radney,	1
the	1
mate,	1
a	1
Vineyarder,	1
and	1
the	1
bitterly	1
provoked	1
vengeance	1
of	1
Steelkilt,	1
a	1
Lakeman	1
and	1
desperado	1
from	1
Buffalo.	1
"'Lakeman!--Buffalo!	1
Pray,	1
what	1
is	1
a	1
Lakeman,	1
and	1
where	1
is	1
Buffalo?'	1
said	1
Don	1
Sebastian,	1
rising	1
in	1
his	1
swinging	1
mat	1
of	1
grass.	1
"On	1
the	1
eastern	1
shore	1
of	1
our	1
Lake	1
Erie,	1
Don;	1
but--I	1
crave	1
your	1
courtesy--may	1
be,	1
you	1
shall	1
soon	1
hear	1
further	1
of	1
all	1
that.	1
Now,	1
gentlemen,	1
in	1
square-sail	1
brigs	1
and	1
three-masted	1
ships,	1
well-nigh	1
as	1
large	1
and	1
stout	1
as	1
any	1
that	1
ever	1
sailed	1
out	1
of	1
your	1
old	1
Callao	1
to	1
far	1
Manilla;	1
this	1
Lakeman,	1
in	1
the	1
land-locked	1
heart	1
of	1
our	1
America,	1
had	1
yet	1
been	1
nurtured	1
by	1
all	1
those	1
agrarian	1
freebooting	1
impressions	1
popularly	1
connected	1
with	1
the	1
open	1
ocean.	1
For	1
in	1
their	1
interflowing	1
aggregate,	1
those	1
grand	1
fresh-water	1
seas	1
of	1
ours,--Erie,	1
and	1
Ontario,	1
and	1
Huron,	1
and	1
Superior,	1
and	1
Michigan,--possess	1
an	1
ocean-like	1
expansiveness,	1
with	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
ocean's	1
noblest	1
traits;	1
with	1
many	1
of	1
its	1
rimmed	1
varieties	1
of	1
races	1
and	1
of	1
climes.	1
They	1
contain	1
round	1
archipelagoes	1
of	1
romantic	1
isles,	1
even	1
as	1
the	1
Polynesian	1
waters	1
do;	1
in	1
large	1
part,	1
are	1
shored	1
by	1
two	1
great	1
contrasting	1
nations,	1
as	1
the	1
Atlantic	1
is;	1
they	1
furnish	1
long	1
maritime	1
approaches	1
to	1
our	1
numerous	1
territorial	1
colonies	1
from	1
the	1
East,	1
dotted	1
all	1
round	1
their	1
banks;	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
are	1
frowned	1
upon	1
by	1
batteries,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
goat-like	1
craggy	1
guns	1
of	1
lofty	1
Mackinaw;	1
they	1
have	1
heard	1
the	1
fleet	1
thunderings	1
of	1
naval	1
victories;	1
at	1
intervals,	1
they	1
yield	1
their	1
beaches	1
to	1
wild	1
barbarians,	1
whose	1
red	1
painted	1
faces	1
flash	1
from	1
out	1
their	1
peltry	1
wigwams;	1
for	1
leagues	1
and	1
leagues	1
are	1
flanked	1
by	1
ancient	1
and	1
unentered	1
forests,	1
where	1
the	1
gaunt	1
pines	1
stand	1
like	1
serried	1
lines	1
of	1
kings	1
in	1
Gothic	1
genealogies;	1
those	1
same	1
woods	1
harboring	1
wild	1
Afric	1
beasts	1
of	1
prey,	1
and	1
silken	1
creatures	1
whose	1
exported	1
furs	1
give	1
robes	1
to	1
Tartar	1
Emperors;	1
they	1
mirror	1
the	1
paved	1
capitals	1
of	1
Buffalo	1
and	1
Cleveland,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
Winnebago	1
villages;	1
they	1
float	1
alike	1
the	1
full-rigged	1
merchant	1
ship,	1
the	1
armed	1
cruiser	1
of	1
the	1
State,	1
the	1
steamer,	1
and	1
the	1
beech	1
canoe;	1
they	1
are	1
swept	1
by	1
Borean	1
and	1
dismasting	1
blasts	1
as	1
direful	1
as	1
any	1
that	1
lash	1
the	1
salted	1
wave;	1
they	1
know	1
what	1
shipwrecks	1
are,	1
for	1
out	1
of	1
sight	1
of	1
land,	1
however	1
inland,	1
they	1
have	1
drowned	1
full	1
many	1
a	1
midnight	1
ship	1
with	1
all	1
its	1
shrieking	1
crew.	1
Thus,	1
gentlemen,	1
though	1
an	1
inlander,	1
Steelkilt	1
was	1
wild-ocean	1
born,	1
and	1
wild-ocean	1
nurtured;	1
as	1
much	1
of	1
an	1
audacious	1
mariner	1
as	1
any.	1
And	1
for	1
Radney,	1
though	1
in	1
his	1
infancy	1
he	1
may	1
have	1
laid	1
him	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
lone	1
Nantucket	1
beach,	1
to	1
nurse	1
at	1
his	1
maternal	1
sea;	1
though	1
in	1
after	1
life	1
he	1
had	1
long	1
followed	1
our	1
austere	1
Atlantic	1
and	1
your	1
contemplative	1
Pacific;	1
yet	1
was	1
he	1
quite	1
as	1
vengeful	1
and	1
full	1
of	1
social	1
quarrel	1
as	1
the	1
backwoods	1
seaman,	1
fresh	1
from	1
the	1
latitudes	1
of	1
buck-horn	1
handled	1
bowie-knives.	1
Yet	1
was	1
this	1
Nantucketer	1
a	1
man	1
with	1
some	1
good-hearted	1
traits;	1
and	1
this	1
Lakeman,	1
a	1
mariner,	1
who	1
though	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
devil	1
indeed,	1
might	1
yet	1
by	1
inflexible	1
firmness,	1
only	1
tempered	1
by	1
that	1
common	1
decency	1
of	1
human	1
recognition	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
meanest	1
slave's	1
right;	1
thus	1
treated,	1
this	1
Steelkilt	1
had	1
long	1
been	1
retained	1
harmless	1
and	1
docile.	1
At	1
all	1
events,	1
he	1
had	1
proved	1
so	1
thus	1
far;	1
but	1
Radney	1
was	1
doomed	1
and	1
made	1
mad,	1
and	1
Steelkilt--but,	1
gentlemen,	1
you	1
shall	1
hear.	1
"It	1
was	1
not	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
day	1
or	1
two	1
at	1
the	1
furthest	1
after	1
pointing	1
her	1
prow	1
for	1
her	1
island	1
haven,	1
that	1
the	1
Town-Ho's	1
leak	1
seemed	1
again	1
increasing,	1
but	1
only	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
require	1
an	1
hour	1
or	1
more	1
at	1
the	1
pumps	1
every	1
day.	1
You	1
must	1
know	1
that	1
in	1
a	1
settled	1
and	1
civilized	1
ocean	1
like	1
our	1
Atlantic,	1
for	1
example,	1
some	1
skippers	1
think	1
little	1
of	1
pumping	1
their	1
whole	1
way	1
across	1
it;	1
though	1
of	1
a	1
still,	1
sleepy	1
night,	1
should	1
the	1
officer	1
of	1
the	1
deck	1
happen	1
to	1
forget	1
his	1
duty	1
in	1
that	1
respect,	1
the	1
probability	1
would	1
be	1
that	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
shipmates	1
would	1
never	1
again	1
remember	1
it,	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
all	1
hands	1
gently	1
subsiding	1
to	1
the	1
bottom.	1
Nor	1
in	1
the	1
solitary	1
and	1
savage	1
seas	1
far	1
from	1
you	1
to	1
the	1
westward,	1
gentlemen,	1
is	1
it	1
altogether	1
unusual	1
for	1
ships	1
to	1
keep	1
clanging	1
at	1
their	1
pump-handles	1
in	1
full	1
chorus	1
even	1
for	1
a	1
voyage	1
of	1
considerable	1
length;	1
that	1
is,	1
if	1
it	1
lie	1
along	1
a	1
tolerably	1
accessible	1
coast,	1
or	1
if	1
any	1
other	1
reasonable	1
retreat	1
is	1
afforded	1
them.	1
It	1
is	1
only	1
when	1
a	1
leaky	1
vessel	1
is	1
in	1
some	1
very	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way	1
part	1
of	1
those	1
waters,	1
some	1
really	1
landless	1
latitude,	1
that	1
her	1
captain	1
begins	1
to	1
feel	1
a	1
little	1
anxious.	1
"Much	1
this	1
way	1
had	1
it	1
been	1
with	1
the	1
Town-Ho;	1
so	1
when	1
her	1
leak	1
was	1
found	1
gaining	1
once	1
more,	1
there	1
was	1
in	1
truth	1
some	1
small	1
concern	1
manifested	1
by	1
several	1
of	1
her	1
company;	1
especially	1
by	1
Radney	1
the	1
mate.	1
He	1
commanded	1
the	1
upper	1
sails	1
to	1
be	1
well	1
hoisted,	1
sheeted	1
home	1
anew,	1
and	1
every	1
way	1
expanded	1
to	1
the	1
breeze.	1
Now	1
this	1
Radney,	1
I	1
suppose,	1
was	1
as	1
little	1
of	1
a	1
coward,	1
and	1
as	1
little	1
inclined	1
to	1
any	1
sort	1
of	1
nervous	1
apprehensiveness	1
touching	1
his	1
own	1
person	1
as	1
any	1
fearless,	1
unthinking	1
creature	1
on	1
land	1
or	1
on	1
sea	1
that	1
you	1
can	1
conveniently	1
imagine,	1
gentlemen.	1
Therefore	1
when	1
he	1
betrayed	1
this	1
solicitude	1
about	1
the	1
safety	1
of	1
the	1
ship,	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
seamen	1
declared	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
his	1
being	1
a	1
part	1
owner	1
in	1
her.	1
So	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
working	1
that	1
evening	1
at	1
the	1
pumps,	1
there	1
was	1
on	1
this	1
head	1
no	1
small	1
gamesomeness	1
slily	1
going	1
on	1
among	1
them,	1
as	1
they	1
stood	1
with	1
their	1
feet	1
continually	1
overflowed	1
by	1
the	1
rippling	1
clear	1
water;	1
clear	1
as	1
any	1
mountain	1
spring,	1
gentlemen--that	1
bubbling	1
from	1
the	1
pumps	1
ran	1
across	1
the	1
deck,	1
and	1
poured	1
itself	1
out	1
in	1
steady	1
spouts	1
at	1
the	1
lee	1
scupper-holes.	1
"Now,	1
as	1
you	1
well	1
know,	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
seldom	1
the	1
case	1
in	1
this	1
conventional	1
world	1
of	1
ours--watery	1
or	1
otherwise;	1
that	1
when	1
a	1
person	1
placed	1
in	1
command	1
over	1
his	1
fellow-men	1
finds	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
very	1
significantly	1
his	1
superior	1
in	1
general	1
pride	1
of	1
manhood,	1
straightway	1
against	1
that	1
man	1
he	1
conceives	1
an	1
unconquerable	1
dislike	1
and	1
bitterness;	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
have	1
a	1
chance	1
he	1
will	1
pull	1
down	1
and	1
pulverize	1
that	1
subaltern's	1
tower,	1
and	1
make	1
a	1
little	1
heap	1
of	1
dust	1
of	1
it.	1
Be	1
this	1
conceit	1
of	1
mine	1
as	1
it	1
may,	1
gentlemen,	1
at	1
all	1
events	1
Steelkilt	1
was	1
a	1
tall	1
and	1
noble	1
animal	1
with	1
a	1
head	1
like	1
a	1
Roman,	1
and	1
a	1
flowing	1
golden	1
beard	1
like	1
the	1
tasseled	1
housings	1
of	1
your	1
last	1
viceroy's	1
snorting	1
charger;	1
and	1
a	1
brain,	1
and	1
a	1
heart,	1
and	1
a	1
soul	1
in	1
him,	1
gentlemen,	1
which	1
had	1
made	1
Steelkilt	1
Charlemagne,	1
had	1
he	1
been	1
born	1
son	1
to	1
Charlemagne's	1
father.	1
But	1
Radney,	1
the	1
mate,	1
was	1
ugly	1
as	1
a	1
mule;	1
yet	1
as	1
hardy,	1
as	1
stubborn,	1
as	1
malicious.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
love	1
Steelkilt,	1
and	1
Steelkilt	1
knew	1
it.	1
"Espying	1
the	1
mate	1
drawing	1
near	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
toiling	1
at	1
the	1
pump	1
with	1
the	1
rest,	1
the	1
Lakeman	1
affected	1
not	1
to	1
notice	1
him,	1
but	1
unawed,	1
went	1
on	1
with	1
his	1
gay	1
banterings.	1
"'Aye,	1
aye,	1
my	1
merry	1
lads,	1
it's	1
a	1
lively	1
leak	1
this;	1
hold	1
a	1
cannikin,	1
one	1
of	1
ye,	1
and	1
let's	1
have	1
a	1
taste.	1
By	1
the	1
Lord,	1
it's	1
worth	1
bottling!	1
I	1
tell	1
ye	1
what,	1
men,	1
old	1
Rad's	1
investment	1
must	1
go	1
for	1
it!	1
he	1
had	1
best	1
cut	1
away	1
his	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
hull	1
and	1
tow	1
it	1
home.	1
The	1
fact	1
is,	1
boys,	1
that	1
sword-fish	1
only	1
began	1
the	1
job;	1
he's	1
come	1
back	1
again	1
with	1
a	1
gang	1
of	1
ship-carpenters,	1
saw-fish,	1
and	1
file-fish,	1
and	1
what	1
not;	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
posse	1
of	1
'em	1
are	1
now	1
hard	1
at	1
work	1
cutting	1
and	1
slashing	1
at	1
the	1
bottom;	1
making	1
improvements,	1
I	1
suppose.	1
If	1
old	1
Rad	1
were	1
here	1
now,	1
I'd	1
tell	1
him	1
to	1
jump	1
overboard	1
and	1
scatter	1
'em.	1
They're	1
playing	1
the	1
devil	1
with	1
his	1
estate,	1
I	1
can	1
tell	1
him.	1
But	1
he's	1
a	1
simple	1
old	1
soul,--Rad,	1
and	1
a	1
beauty	1
too.	1
Boys,	1
they	1
say	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
his	1
property	1
is	1
invested	1
in	1
looking-glasses.	1
I	1
wonder	1
if	1
he'd	1
give	1
a	1
poor	1
devil	1
like	1
me	1
the	1
model	1
of	1
his	1
nose.'	1
"'Damn	1
your	1
eyes!	1
what's	1
that	1
pump	1
stopping	1
for?'	1
roared	1
Radney,	1
pretending	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
heard	1
the	1
sailors'	1
talk.	1
'Thunder	1
away	1
at	1
it!'	1
'Aye,	1
aye,	1
sir,'	1
said	1
Steelkilt,	1
merry	1
as	1
a	1
cricket.	1
'Lively,	1
boys,	1
lively,	1
now!'	1
And	1
with	1
that	1
the	1
pump	1
clanged	1
like	1
fifty	1
fire-engines;	1
the	1
men	1
tossed	1
their	1
hats	1
off	1
to	1
it,	1
and	1
ere	1
long	1
that	1
peculiar	1
gasping	1
of	1
the	1
lungs	1
was	1
heard	1
which	1
denotes	1
the	1
fullest	1
tension	1
of	1
life's	1
utmost	1
energies.	1
"Quitting	1
the	1
pump	1
at	1
last,	1
with	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
his	1
band,	1
the	1
Lakeman	1
went	1
forward	1
all	1
panting,	1
and	1
sat	1
himself	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
windlass;	1
his	1
face	1
fiery	1
red,	1
his	1
eyes	1
bloodshot,	1
and	1
wiping	1
the	1
profuse	1
sweat	1
from	1
his	1
brow.	1
Now	1
what	1
cozening	1
fiend	1
it	1
was,	1
gentlemen,	1
that	1
possessed	1
Radney	1
to	1
meddle	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
that	1
corporeally	1
exasperated	1
state,	1
I	1
know	1
not;	1
but	1
so	1
it	1
happened.	1
Intolerably	1
striding	1
along	1
the	1
deck,	1
the	1
mate	1
commanded	1
him	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
broom	1
and	1
sweep	1
down	1
the	1
planks,	1
and	1
also	1
a	1
shovel,	1
and	1
remove	1
some	1
offensive	1
matters	1
consequent	1
upon	1
allowing	1
a	1
pig	1
to	1
run	1
at	1
large.	1
"Now,	1
gentlemen,	1
sweeping	1
a	1
ship's	1
deck	1
at	1
sea	1
is	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
household	1
work	1
which	1
in	1
all	1
times	1
but	1
raging	1
gales	1
is	1
regularly	1
attended	1
to	1
every	1
evening;	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
known	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
ships	1
actually	1
foundering	1
at	1
the	1
time.	1
Such,	1
gentlemen,	1
is	1
the	1
inflexibility	1
of	1
sea-usages	1
and	1
the	1
instinctive	1
love	1
of	1
neatness	1
in	1
seamen;	1
some	1
of	1
whom	1
would	1
not	1
willingly	1
drown	1
without	1
first	1
washing	1
their	1
faces.	1
But	1
in	1
all	1
vessels	1
this	1
broom	1
business	1
is	1
the	1
prescriptive	1
province	1
of	1
the	1
boys,	1
if	1
boys	1
there	1
be	1
aboard.	1
Besides,	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
stronger	1
men	1
in	1
the	1
Town-Ho	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
divided	1
into	1
gangs,	1
taking	1
turns	1
at	1
the	1
pumps;	1
and	1
being	1
the	1
most	1
athletic	1
seaman	1
of	1
them	1
all,	1
Steelkilt	1
had	1
been	1
regularly	1
assigned	1
captain	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
gangs;	1
consequently	1
he	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
freed	1
from	1
any	1
trivial	1
business	1
not	1
connected	1
with	1
truly	1
nautical	1
duties,	1
such	1
being	1
the	1
case	1
with	1
his	1
comrades.	1
I	1
mention	1
all	1
these	1
particulars	1
so	1
that	1
you	1
may	1
understand	1
exactly	1
how	1
this	1
affair	1
stood	1
between	1
the	1
two	1
men.	1
"But	1
there	1
was	1
more	1
than	1
this:	1
the	1
order	1
about	1
the	1
shovel	1
was	1
almost	1
as	1
plainly	1
meant	1
to	1
sting	1
and	1
insult	1
Steelkilt,	1
as	1
though	1
Radney	1
had	1
spat	1
in	1
his	1
face.	1
Any	1
man	1
who	1
has	1
gone	1
sailor	1
in	1
a	1
whale-ship	1
will	1
understand	1
this;	1
and	1
all	1
this	1
and	1
doubtless	1
much	1
more,	1
the	1
Lakeman	1
fully	1
comprehended	1
when	1
the	1
mate	1
uttered	1
his	1
command.	1
But	1
as	1
he	1
sat	1
still	1
for	1
a	1
moment,	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
steadfastly	1
looked	1
into	1
the	1
mate's	1
malignant	1
eye	1
and	1
perceived	1
the	1
stacks	1
of	1
powder-casks	1
heaped	1
up	1
in	1
him	1
and	1
the	1
slow-match	1
silently	1
burning	1
along	1
towards	1
them;	1
as	1
he	1
instinctively	1
saw	1
all	1
this,	1
that	1
strange	1
forbearance	1
and	1
unwillingness	1
to	1
stir	1
up	1
the	1
deeper	1
passionateness	1
in	1
any	1
already	1
ireful	1
being--a	1
repugnance	1
most	1
felt,	1
when	1
felt	1
at	1
all,	1
by	1
really	1
valiant	1
men	1
even	1
when	1
aggrieved--this	1
nameless	1
phantom	1
feeling,	1
gentlemen,	1
stole	1
over	1
Steelkilt.	1
"Therefore,	1
in	1
his	1
ordinary	1
tone,	1
only	1
a	1
little	1
broken	1
by	1
the	1
bodily	1
exhaustion	1
he	1
was	1
temporarily	1
in,	1
he	1
answered	1
him	1
saying	1
that	1
sweeping	1
the	1
deck	1
was	1
not	1
his	1
business,	1
and	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
do	1
it.	1
And	1
then,	1
without	1
at	1
all	1
alluding	1
to	1
the	1
shovel,	1
he	1
pointed	1
to	1
three	1
lads	1
as	1
the	1
customary	1
sweepers;	1
who,	1
not	1
being	1
billeted	1
at	1
the	1
pumps,	1
had	1
done	1
little	1
or	1
nothing	1
all	1
day.	1
To	1
this,	1
Radney	1
replied	1
with	1
an	1
oath,	1
in	1
a	1
most	1
domineering	1
and	1
outrageous	1
manner	1
unconditionally	1
reiterating	1
his	1
command;	1
meanwhile	1
advancing	1
upon	1
the	1
still	1
seated	1
Lakeman,	1
with	1
an	1
uplifted	1
cooper's	1
club	1
hammer	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
snatched	1
from	1
a	1
cask	1
near	1
by.	1
"Heated	1
and	1
irritated	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
by	1
his	1
spasmodic	1
toil	1
at	1
the	1
pumps,	1
for	1
all	1
his	1
first	1
nameless	1
feeling	1
of	1
forbearance	1
the	1
sweating	1
Steelkilt	1
could	1
but	1
ill	1
brook	1
this	1
bearing	1
in	1
the	1
mate;	1
but	1
somehow	1
still	1
smothering	1
the	1
conflagration	1
within	1
him,	1
without	1
speaking	1
he	1
remained	1
doggedly	1
rooted	1
to	1
his	1
seat,	1
till	1
at	1
last	1
the	1
incensed	1
Radney	1
shook	1
the	1
hammer	1
within	1
a	1
few	1
inches	1
of	1
his	1
face,	1
furiously	1
commanding	1
him	1
to	1
do	1
his	1
bidding.	1
"Steelkilt	1
rose,	1
and	1
slowly	1
retreating	1
round	1
the	1
windlass,	1
steadily	1
followed	1
by	1
the	1
mate	1
with	1
his	1
menacing	1
hammer,	1
deliberately	1
repeated	1
his	1
intention	1
not	1
to	1
obey.	1
Seeing,	1
however,	1
that	1
his	1
forbearance	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
slightest	1
effect,	1
by	1
an	1
awful	1
and	1
unspeakable	1
intimation	1
with	1
his	1
twisted	1
hand	1
he	1
warned	1
off	1
the	1
foolish	1
and	1
infatuated	1
man;	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
no	1
purpose.	1
And	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
the	1
two	1
went	1
once	1
slowly	1
round	1
the	1
windlass;	1
when,	1
resolved	1
at	1
last	1
no	1
longer	1
to	1
retreat,	1
bethinking	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
now	1
forborne	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
comported	1
with	1
his	1
humor,	1
the	1
Lakeman	1
paused	1
on	1
the	1
hatches	1
and	1
thus	1
spoke	1
to	1
the	1
officer:	1
"'Mr.	1
Radney,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
obey	1
you.	1
Take	1
that	1
hammer	1
away,	1
or	1
look	1
to	1
yourself.'	1
But	1
the	1
predestinated	1
mate	1
coming	1
still	1
closer	1
to	1
him,	1
where	1
the	1
Lakeman	1
stood	1
fixed,	1
now	1
shook	1
the	1
heavy	1
hammer	1
within	1
an	1
inch	1
of	1
his	1
teeth;	1
meanwhile	1
repeating	1
a	1
string	1
of	1
insufferable	1
maledictions.	1
Retreating	1
not	1
the	1
thousandth	1
part	1
of	1
an	1
inch;	1
stabbing	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
eye	1
with	1
the	1
unflinching	1
poniard	1
of	1
his	1
glance,	1
Steelkilt,	1
clenching	1
his	1
right	1
hand	1
behind	1
him	1
and	1
creepingly	1
drawing	1
it	1
back,	1
told	1
his	1
persecutor	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
hammer	1
but	1
grazed	1
his	1
cheek	1
he	1
(Steelkilt)	1
would	1
murder	1
him.	1
But,	1
gentlemen,	1
the	1
fool	1
had	1
been	1
branded	1
for	1
the	1
slaughter	1
by	1
the	1
gods.	1
Immediately	1
the	1
hammer	1
touched	1
the	1
cheek;	1
the	1
next	1
instant	1
the	1
lower	1
jaw	1
of	1
the	1
mate	1
was	1
stove	1
in	1
his	1
head;	1
he	1
fell	1
on	1
the	1
hatch	1
spouting	1
blood	1
like	1
a	1
whale.	1
"Ere	1
the	1
cry	1
could	1
go	1
aft	1
Steelkilt	1
was	1
shaking	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
backstays	1
leading	1
far	1
aloft	1
to	1
where	1
two	1
of	1
his	1
comrades	1
were	1
standing	1
their	1
mastheads.	1
They	1
were	1
both	1
Canallers.	1
"'Canallers!'	1
cried	1
Don	1
Pedro.	1
'We	1
have	1
seen	1
many	1
whale-ships	1
in	1
our	1
harbours,	1
but	1
never	1
heard	1
of	1
your	1
Canallers.	1
Pardon:	1
who	1
and	1
what	1
are	1
they?'	1
"'Canallers,	1
Don,	1
are	1
the	1
boatmen	1
belonging	1
to	1
our	1
grand	1
Erie	1
Canal.	1
You	1
must	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
it.'	1
"'Nay,	1
Senor;	1
hereabouts	1
in	1
this	1
dull,	1
warm,	1
most	1
lazy,	1
and	1
hereditary	1
land,	1
we	1
know	1
but	1
little	1
of	1
your	1
vigorous	1
North.'	1
"'Aye?	1
Well	1
then,	1
Don,	1
refill	1
my	1
cup.	1
Your	1
chicha's	1
very	1
fine;	1
and	1
ere	1
proceeding	1
further	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
ye	1
what	1
our	1
Canallers	1
are;	1
for	1
such	1
information	1
may	1
throw	1
side-light	1
upon	1
my	1
story.'	1
"For	1
three	1
hundred	1
and	1
sixty	1
miles,	1
gentlemen,	1
through	1
the	1
entire	1
breadth	1
of	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
New	1
York;	1
through	1
numerous	1
populous	1
cities	1
and	1
most	1
thriving	1
villages;	1
through	1
long,	1
dismal,	1
uninhabited	1
swamps,	1
and	1
affluent,	1
cultivated	1
fields,	1
unrivalled	1
for	1
fertility;	1
by	1
billiard-room	1
and	1
bar-room;	1
through	1
the	1
holy-of-holies	1
of	1
great	1
forests;	1
on	1
Roman	1
arches	1
over	1
Indian	1
rivers;	1
through	1
sun	1
and	1
shade;	1
by	1
happy	1
hearts	1
or	1
broken;	1
through	1
all	1
the	1
wide	1
contrasting	1
scenery	1
of	1
those	1
noble	1
Mohawk	1
counties;	1
and	1
especially,	1
by	1
rows	1
of	1
snow-white	1
chapels,	1
whose	1
spires	1
stand	1
almost	1
like	1
milestones,	1
flows	1
one	1
continual	1
stream	1
of	1
Venetianly	1
corrupt	1
and	1
often	1
lawless	1
life.	1
There's	1
your	1
true	1
Ashantee,	1
gentlemen;	1
there	1
howl	1
your	1
pagans;	1
where	1
you	1
ever	1
find	1
them,	1
next	1
door	1
to	1
you;	1
under	1
the	1
long-flung	1
shadow,	1
and	1
the	1
snug	1
patronising	1
lee	1
of	1
churches.	1
For	1
by	1
some	1
curious	1
fatality,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
often	1
noted	1
of	1
your	1
metropolitan	1
freebooters	1
that	1
they	1
ever	1
encamp	1
around	1
the	1
halls	1
of	1
justice,	1
so	1
sinners,	1
gentlemen,	1
most	1
abound	1
in	1
holiest	1
vicinities.	1
"'Is	1
that	1
a	1
friar	1
passing?'	1
said	1
Don	1
Pedro,	1
looking	1
downwards	1
into	1
the	1
crowded	1
plazza,	1
with	1
humorous	1
concern.	1
"'Well	1
for	1
our	1
northern	1
friend,	1
Dame	1
Isabella's	1
Inquisition	1
wanes	1
in	1
Lima,'	1
laughed	1
Don	1
Sebastian.	1
'Proceed,	1
Senor.'	1
"'A	1
moment!	1
Pardon!'	1
cried	1
another	1
of	1
the	1
company.	1
'In	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
all	1
us	1
Limeese,	1
I	1
but	1
desire	1
to	1
express	1
to	1
you,	1
sir	1
sailor,	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
overlooked	1
your	1
delicacy	1
in	1
not	1
substituting	1
present	1
Lima	1
for	1
distant	1
Venice	1
in	1
your	1
corrupt	1
comparison.	1
Oh!	1
do	1
not	1
bow	1
and	1
look	1
surprised;	1
you	1
know	1
the	1
proverb	1
all	1
along	1
this	1
coast--"Corrupt	1
as	1
Lima."	1
It	1
but	1
bears	1
out	1
your	1
saying,	1
too;	1
churches	1
more	1
plentiful	1
than	1
billiard-tables,	1
and	1
for	1
ever	1
open--and	1
"Corrupt	1
as	1
Lima."	1
So,	1
too,	1
Venice;	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
there;	1
the	1
holy	1
city	1
of	1
the	1
blessed	1
evangelist,	1
St.	1
Mark!--St.	1
Dominic,	1
purge	1
it!	1
Your	1
cup!	1
Thanks:	1
here	1
I	1
refill;	1
now,	1
you	1
pour	1
out	1
again.'	1
"Freely	1
depicted	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
vocation,	1
gentlemen,	1
the	1
Canaller	1
would	1
make	1
a	1
fine	1
dramatic	1
hero,	1
so	1
abundantly	1
and	1
picturesquely	1
wicked	1
is	1
he.	1
Like	1
Mark	1
Antony,	1
for	1
days	1
and	1
days	1
along	1
his	1
green-turfed,	1
flowery	1
Nile,	1
he	1
indolently	1
floats,	1
openly	1
toying	1
with	1
his	1
red-cheeked	1
Cleopatra,	1
ripening	1
his	1
apricot	1
thigh	1
upon	1
the	1
sunny	1
deck.	1
But	1
ashore,	1
all	1
this	1
effeminacy	1
is	1
dashed.	1
The	1
brigandish	1
guise	1
which	1
the	1
Canaller	1
so	1
proudly	1
sports;	1
his	1
slouched	1
and	1
gaily-ribboned	1
hat	1
betoken	1
his	1
grand	1
features.	1
A	1
terror	1
to	1
the	1
smiling	1
innocence	1
of	1
the	1
villages	1
through	1
which	1
he	1
floats;	1
his	1
swart	1
visage	1
and	1
bold	1
swagger	1
are	1
not	1
unshunned	1
in	1
cities.	1
Once	1
a	1
vagabond	1
on	1
his	1
own	1
canal,	1
I	1
have	1
received	1
good	1
turns	1
from	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
Canallers;	1
I	1
thank	1
him	1
heartily;	1
would	1
fain	1
be	1
not	1
ungrateful;	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
often	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
prime	1
redeeming	1
qualities	1
of	1
your	1
man	1
of	1
violence,	1
that	1
at	1
times	1
he	1
has	1
as	1
stiff	1
an	1
arm	1
to	1
back	1
a	1
poor	1
stranger	1
in	1
a	1
strait,	1
as	1
to	1
plunder	1
a	1
wealthy	1
one.	1
In	1
sum,	1
gentlemen,	1
what	1
the	1
wildness	1
of	1
this	1
canal	1
life	1
is,	1
is	1
emphatically	1
evinced	1
by	1
this;	1
that	1
our	1
wild	1
whale-fishery	1
contains	1
so	1
many	1
of	1
its	1
most	1
finished	1
graduates,	1
and	1
that	1
scarce	1
any	1
race	1
of	1
mankind,	1
except	1
Sydney	1
men,	1
are	1
so	1
much	1
distrusted	1
by	1
our	1
whaling	1
captains.	1
Nor	1
does	1
it	1
at	1
all	1
diminish	1
the	1
curiousness	1
of	1
this	1
matter,	1
that	1
to	1
many	1
thousands	1
of	1
our	1
rural	1
boys	1
and	1
young	1
men	1
born	1
along	1
its	1
line,	1
the	1
probationary	1
life	1
of	1
the	1
Grand	1
Canal	1
furnishes	1
the	1
sole	1
transition	1
between	1
quietly	1
reaping	1
in	1
a	1
Christian	1
corn-field,	1
and	1
recklessly	1
ploughing	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
barbaric	1
seas.	1
"'I	1
see!	1
I	1
see!'	1
impetuously	1
exclaimed	1
Don	1
Pedro,	1
spilling	1
his	1
chicha	1
upon	1
his	1
silvery	1
ruffles.	1
'No	1
need	1
to	1
travel!	1
The	1
world's	1
one	1
Lima.	1
I	1
had	1
thought,	1
now,	1
that	1
at	1
your	1
temperate	1
North	1
the	1
generations	1
were	1
cold	1
and	1
holy	1
as	1
the	1
hills.--But	1
the	1
story.'	1
"I	1
left	1
off,	1
gentlemen,	1
where	1
the	1
Lakeman	1
shook	1
the	1
backstay.	1
Hardly	1
had	1
he	1
done	1
so,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
surrounded	1
by	1
the	1
three	1
junior	1
mates	1
and	1
the	1
four	1
harpooneers,	1
who	1
all	1
crowded	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
deck.	1
But	1
sliding	1
down	1
the	1
ropes	1
like	1
baleful	1
comets,	1
the	1
two	1
Canallers	1
rushed	1
into	1
the	1
uproar,	1
and	1
sought	1
to	1
drag	1
their	1
man	1
out	1
of	1
it	1
towards	1
the	1
forecastle.	1
Others	1
of	1
the	1
sailors	1
joined	1
with	1
them	1
in	1
this	1
attempt,	1
and	1
a	1
twisted	1
turmoil	1
ensued;	1
while	1
standing	1
out	1
of	1
harm's	1
way,	1
the	1
valiant	1
captain	1
danced	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
with	1
a	1
whale-pike,	1
calling	1
upon	1
his	1
officers	1
to	1
manhandle	1
that	1
atrocious	1
scoundrel,	1
and	1
smoke	1
him	1
along	1
to	1
the	1
quarter-deck.	1
At	1
intervals,	1
he	1
ran	1
close	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
revolving	1
border	1
of	1
the	1
confusion,	1
and	1
prying	1
into	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
it	1
with	1
his	1
pike,	1
sought	1
to	1
prick	1
out	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
his	1
resentment.	1
But	1
Steelkilt	1
and	1
his	1
desperadoes	1
were	1
too	1
much	1
for	1
them	1
all;	1
they	1
succeeded	1
in	1
gaining	1
the	1
forecastle	1
deck,	1
where,	1
hastily	1
slewing	1
about	1
three	1
or	1
four	1
large	1
casks	1
in	1
a	1
line	1
with	1
the	1
windlass,	1
these	1
sea-Parisians	1
entrenched	1
themselves	1
behind	1
the	1
barricade.	1
"'Come	1
out	1
of	1
that,	1
ye	1
pirates!'	1
roared	1
the	1
captain,	1
now	1
menacing	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
pistol	1
in	1
each	1
hand,	1
just	1
brought	1
to	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
steward.	1
'Come	1
out	1
of	1
that,	1
ye	1
cut-throats!'	1
"Steelkilt	1
leaped	1
on	1
the	1
barricade,	1
and	1
striding	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
there,	1
defied	1
the	1
worst	1
the	1
pistols	1
could	1
do;	1
but	1
gave	1
the	1
captain	1
to	1
understand	1
distinctly,	1
that	1
his	1
(Steelkilt's)	1
death	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
signal	1
for	1
a	1
murderous	1
mutiny	1
on	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
all	1
hands.	1
Fearing	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
lest	1
this	1
might	1
prove	1
but	1
too	1
true,	1
the	1
captain	1
a	1
little	1
desisted,	1
but	1
still	1
commanded	1
the	1
insurgents	1
instantly	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
their	1
duty.	1
"'Will	1
you	1
promise	1
not	1
to	1
touch	1
us,	1
if	1
we	1
do?'	1
demanded	1
their	1
ringleader.	1
"'Turn	1
to!	1
turn	1
to!--I	1
make	1
no	1
promise;--to	1
your	1
duty!	1
Do	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
sink	1
the	1
ship,	1
by	1
knocking	1
off	1
at	1
a	1
time	1
like	1
this?	1
Turn	1
to!'	1
and	1
he	1
once	1
more	1
raised	1
a	1
pistol.	1
"'Sink	1
the	1
ship?'	1
cried	1
Steelkilt.	1
'Aye,	1
let	1
her	1
sink.	1
Not	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
us	1
turns	1
to,	1
unless	1
you	1
swear	1
not	1
to	1
raise	1
a	1
rope-yarn	1
against	1
us.	1
What	1
say	1
ye,	1
men?'	1
turning	1
to	1
his	1
comrades.	1
A	1
fierce	1
cheer	1
was	1
their	1
response.	1
"The	1
Lakeman	1
now	1
patrolled	1
the	1
barricade,	1
all	1
the	1
while	1
keeping	1
his	1
eye	1
on	1
the	1
Captain,	1
and	1
jerking	1
out	1
such	1
sentences	1
as	1
these:--'It's	1
not	1
our	1
fault;	1
we	1
didn't	1
want	1
it;	1
I	1
told	1
him	1
to	1
take	1
his	1
hammer	1
away;	1
it	1
was	1
boy's	1
business;	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
known	1
me	1
before	1
this;	1
I	1
told	1
him	1
not	1
to	1
prick	1
the	1
buffalo;	1
I	1
believe	1
I	1
have	1
broken	1
a	1
finger	1
here	1
against	1
his	1
cursed	1
jaw;	1
ain't	1
those	1
mincing	1
knives	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
forecastle	1
there,	1
men?	1
look	1
to	1
those	1
handspikes,	1
my	1
hearties.	1
Captain,	1
by	1
God,	1
look	1
to	1
yourself;	1
say	1
the	1
word;	1
don't	1
be	1
a	1
fool;	1
forget	1
it	1
all;	1
we	1
are	1
ready	1
to	1
turn	1
to;	1
treat	1
us	1
decently,	1
and	1
we're	1
your	1
men;	1
but	1
we	1
won't	1
be	1
flogged.'	1
"'Turn	1
to!	1
I	1
make	1
no	1
promises,	1
turn	1
to,	1
I	1
say!'	1
"'Look	1
ye,	1
now,'	1
cried	1
the	1
Lakeman,	1
flinging	1
out	1
his	1
arm	1
towards	1
him,	1
'there	1
are	1
a	1
few	1
of	1
us	1
here	1
(and	1
I	1
am	1
one	1
of	1
them)	1
who	1
have	1
shipped	1
for	1
the	1
cruise,	1
d'ye	1
see;	1
now	1
as	1
you	1
well	1
know,	1
sir,	1
we	1
can	1
claim	1
our	1
discharge	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
anchor	1
is	1
down;	1
so	1
we	1
don't	1
want	1
a	1
row;	1
it's	1
not	1
our	1
interest;	1
we	1
want	1
to	1
be	1
peaceable;	1
we	1
are	1
ready	1
to	1
work,	1
but	1
we	1
won't	1
be	1
flogged.'	1
"'Turn	1
to!'	1
roared	1
the	1
Captain.	1
"Steelkilt	1
glanced	1
round	1
him	1
a	1
moment,	1
and	1
then	1
said:--'I	1
tell	1
you	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
now,	1
Captain,	1
rather	1
than	1
kill	1
ye,	1
and	1
be	1
hung	1
for	1
such	1
a	1
shabby	1
rascal,	1
we	1
won't	1
lift	1
a	1
hand	1
against	1
ye	1
unless	1
ye	1
attack	1
us;	1
but	1
till	1
you	1
say	1
the	1
word	1
about	1
not	1
flogging	1
us,	1
we	1
don't	1
do	1
a	1
hand's	1
turn.'	1
"'Down	1
into	1
the	1
forecastle	1
then,	1
down	1
with	1
ye,	1
I'll	1
keep	1
ye	1
there	1
till	1
ye're	1
sick	1
of	1
it.	1
Down	1
ye	1
go.'	1
"'Shall	1
we?'	1
cried	1
the	1
ringleader	1
to	1
his	1
men.	1
Most	1
of	1
them	1
were	1
against	1
it;	1
but	1
at	1
length,	1
in	1
obedience	1
to	1
Steelkilt,	1
they	1
preceded	1
him	1
down	1
into	1
their	1
dark	1
den,	1
growlingly	1
disappearing,	1
like	1
bears	1
into	1
a	1
cave.	1
"As	1
the	1
Lakeman's	1
bare	1
head	1
was	1
just	1
level	1
with	1
the	1
planks,	1
the	1
Captain	1
and	1
his	1
posse	1
leaped	1
the	1
barricade,	1
and	1
rapidly	1
drawing	1
over	1
the	1
slide	1
of	1
the	1
scuttle,	1
planted	1
their	1
group	1
of	1
hands	1
upon	1
it,	1
and	1
loudly	1
called	1
for	1
the	1
steward	1
to	1
bring	1
the	1
heavy	1
brass	1
padlock	1
belonging	1
to	1
the	1
companionway.	1
Then	1
opening	1
the	1
slide	1
a	1
little,	1
the	1
Captain	1
whispered	1
something	1
down	1
the	1
crack,	1
closed	1
it,	1
and	1
turned	1
the	1
key	1
upon	1
them--ten	1
in	1
number--leaving	1
on	1
deck	1
some	1
twenty	1
or	1
more,	1
who	1
thus	1
far	1
had	1
remained	1
neutral.	1
"All	1
night	1
a	1
wide-awake	1
watch	1
was	1
kept	1
by	1
all	1
the	1
officers,	1
forward	1
and	1
aft,	1
especially	1
about	1
the	1
forecastle	1
scuttle	1
and	1
fore	1
hatchway;	1
at	1
which	1
last	1
place	1
it	1
was	1
feared	1
the	1
insurgents	1
might	1
emerge,	1
after	1
breaking	1
through	1
the	1
bulkhead	1
below.	1
But	1
the	1
hours	1
of	1
darkness	1
passed	1
in	1
peace;	1
the	1
men	1
who	1
still	1
remained	1
at	1
their	1
duty	1
toiling	1
hard	1
at	1
the	1
pumps,	1
whose	1
clinking	1
and	1
clanking	1
at	1
intervals	1
through	1
the	1
dreary	1
night	1
dismally	1
resounded	1
through	1
the	1
ship.	1
"At	1
sunrise	1
the	1
Captain	1
went	1
forward,	1
and	1
knocking	1
on	1
the	1
deck,	1
summoned	1
the	1
prisoners	1
to	1
work;	1
but	1
with	1
a	1
yell	1
they	1
refused.	1
Water	1
was	1
then	1
lowered	1
down	1
to	1
them,	1
and	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
handfuls	1
of	1
biscuit	1
were	1
tossed	1
after	1
it;	1
when	1
again	1
turning	1
the	1
key	1
upon	1
them	1
and	1
pocketing	1
it,	1
the	1
Captain	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
quarter-deck.	1
Twice	1
every	1
day	1
for	1
three	1
days	1
this	1
was	1
repeated;	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
fourth	1
morning	1
a	1
confused	1
wrangling,	1
and	1
then	1
a	1
scuffling	1
was	1
heard,	1
as	1
the	1
customary	1
summons	1
was	1
delivered;	1
and	1
suddenly	1
four	1
men	1
burst	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
forecastle,	1
saying	1
they	1
were	1
ready	1
to	1
turn	1
to.	1
The	1
fetid	1
closeness	1
of	1
the	1
air,	1
and	1
a	1
famishing	1
diet,	1
united	1
perhaps	1
to	1
some	1
fears	1
of	1
ultimate	1
retribution,	1
had	1
constrained	1
them	1
to	1
surrender	1
at	1
discretion.	1
Emboldened	1
by	1
this,	1
the	1
Captain	1
reiterated	1
his	1
demand	1
to	1
the	1
rest,	1
but	1
Steelkilt	1
shouted	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
a	1
terrific	1
hint	1
to	1
stop	1
his	1
babbling	1
and	1
betake	1
himself	1
where	1
he	1
belonged.	1
On	1
the	1
fifth	1
morning	1
three	1
others	1
of	1
the	1
mutineers	1
bolted	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
air	1
from	1
the	1
desperate	1
arms	1
below	1
that	1
sought	1
to	1
restrain	1
them.	1
Only	1
three	1
were	1
left.	1
"'Better	1
turn	1
to,	1
now?'	1
said	1
the	1
Captain	1
with	1
a	1
heartless	1
jeer.	1
"'Shut	1
us	1
up	1
again,	1
will	1
ye!'	1
cried	1
Steelkilt.	1
"'Oh	1
certainly,'	1
the	1
Captain,	1
and	1
the	1
key	1
clicked.	1
"It	1
was	1
at	1
this	1
point,	1
gentlemen,	1
that	1
enraged	1
by	1
the	1
defection	1
of	1
seven	1
of	1
his	1
former	1
associates,	1
and	1
stung	1
by	1
the	1
mocking	1
voice	1
that	1
had	1
last	1
hailed	1
him,	1
and	1
maddened	1
by	1
his	1
long	1
entombment	1
in	1
a	1
place	1
as	1
black	1
as	1
the	1
bowels	1
of	1
despair;	1
it	1
was	1
then	1
that	1
Steelkilt	1
proposed	1
to	1
the	1
two	1
Canallers,	1
thus	1
far	1
apparently	1
of	1
one	1
mind	1
with	1
him,	1
to	1
burst	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
hole	1
at	1
the	1
next	1
summoning	1
of	1
the	1
garrison;	1
and	1
armed	1
with	1
their	1
keen	1
mincing	1
knives	1
(long,	1
crescentic,	1
heavy	1
implements	1
with	1
a	1
handle	1
at	1
each	1
end)	1
run	1
amuck	1
from	1
the	1
bowsprit	1
to	1
the	1
taffrail;	1
and	1
if	1
by	1
any	1
devilishness	1
of	1
desperation	1
possible,	1
seize	1
the	1
ship.	1
For	1
himself,	1
he	1
would	1
do	1
this,	1
he	1
said,	1
whether	1
they	1
joined	1
him	1
or	1
not.	1
That	1
was	1
the	1
last	1
night	1
he	1
should	1
spend	1
in	1
that	1
den.	1
But	1
the	1
scheme	1
met	1
with	1
no	1
opposition	1
on	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
two;	1
they	1
swore	1
they	1
were	1
ready	1
for	1
that,	1
or	1
for	1
any	1
other	1
mad	1
thing,	1
for	1
anything	1
in	1
short	1
but	1
a	1
surrender.	1
And	1
what	1
was	1
more,	1
they	1
each	1
insisted	1
upon	1
being	1
the	1
first	1
man	1
on	1
deck,	1
when	1
the	1
time	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
rush	1
should	1
come.	1
But	1
to	1
this	1
their	1
leader	1
as	1
fiercely	1
objected,	1
reserving	1
that	1
priority	1
for	1
himself;	1
particularly	1
as	1
his	1
two	1
comrades	1
would	1
not	1
yield,	1
the	1
one	1
to	1
the	1
other,	1
in	1
the	1
matter;	1
and	1
both	1
of	1
them	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
first,	1
for	1
the	1
ladder	1
would	1
but	1
admit	1
one	1
man	1
at	1
a	1
time.	1
And	1
here,	1
gentlemen,	1
the	1
foul	1
play	1
of	1
these	1
miscreants	1
must	1
come	1
out.	1
"Upon	1
hearing	1
the	1
frantic	1
project	1
of	1
their	1
leader,	1
each	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
separate	1
soul	1
had	1
suddenly	1
lighted,	1
it	1
would	1
seem,	1
upon	1
the	1
same	1
piece	1
of	1
treachery,	1
namely:	1
to	1
be	1
foremost	1
in	1
breaking	1
out,	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
first	1
of	1
the	1
three,	1
though	1
the	1
last	1
of	1
the	1
ten,	1
to	1
surrender;	1
and	1
thereby	1
secure	1
whatever	1
small	1
chance	1
of	1
pardon	1
such	1
conduct	1
might	1
merit.	1
But	1
when	1
Steelkilt	1
made	1
known	1
his	1
determination	1
still	1
to	1
lead	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
last,	1
they	1
in	1
some	1
way,	1
by	1
some	1
subtle	1
chemistry	1
of	1
villany,	1
mixed	1
their	1
before	1
secret	1
treacheries	1
together;	1
and	1
when	1
their	1
leader	1
fell	1
into	1
a	1
doze,	1
verbally	1
opened	1
their	1
souls	1
to	1
each	1
other	1
in	1
three	1
sentences;	1
and	1
bound	1
the	1
sleeper	1
with	1
cords,	1
and	1
gagged	1
him	1
with	1
cords;	1
and	1
shrieked	1
out	1
for	1
the	1
Captain	1
at	1
midnight.	1
"Thinking	1
murder	1
at	1
hand,	1
and	1
smelling	1
in	1
the	1
dark	1
for	1
the	1
blood,	1
he	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
armed	1
mates	1
and	1
harpooneers	1
rushed	1
for	1
the	1
forecastle.	1
In	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
the	1
scuttle	1
was	1
opened,	1
and,	1
bound	1
hand	1
and	1
foot,	1
the	1
still	1
struggling	1
ringleader	1
was	1
shoved	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
air	1
by	1
his	1
perfidious	1
allies,	1
who	1
at	1
once	1
claimed	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
securing	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
fully	1
ripe	1
for	1
murder.	1
But	1
all	1
these	1
were	1
collared,	1
and	1
dragged	1
along	1
the	1
deck	1
like	1
dead	1
cattle;	1
and,	1
side	1
by	1
side,	1
were	1
seized	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
mizzen	1
rigging,	1
like	1
three	1
quarters	1
of	1
meat,	1
and	1
there	1
they	1
hung	1
till	1
morning.	1
'Damn	1
ye,'	1
cried	1
the	1
Captain,	1
pacing	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
before	1
them,	1
'the	1
vultures	1
would	1
not	1
touch	1
ye,	1
ye	1
villains!'	1
"At	1
sunrise	1
he	1
summoned	1
all	1
hands;	1
and	1
separating	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
rebelled	1
from	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
taken	1
no	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
mutiny,	1
he	1
told	1
the	1
former	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
good	1
mind	1
to	1
flog	1
them	1
all	1
round--thought,	1
upon	1
the	1
whole,	1
he	1
would	1
do	1
so--he	1
ought	1
to--justice	1
demanded	1
it;	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
present,	1
considering	1
their	1
timely	1
surrender,	1
he	1
would	1
let	1
them	1
go	1
with	1
a	1
reprimand,	1
which	1
he	1
accordingly	1
administered	1
in	1
the	1
vernacular.	1
"'But	1
as	1
for	1
you,	1
ye	1
carrion	1
rogues,'	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
three	1
men	1
in	1
the	1
rigging--'for	1
you,	1
I	1
mean	1
to	1
mince	1
ye	1
up	1
for	1
the	1
try-pots;'	1
and,	1
seizing	1
a	1
rope,	1
he	1
applied	1
it	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
might	1
to	1
the	1
backs	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
traitors,	1
till	1
they	1
yelled	1
no	1
more,	1
but	1
lifelessly	1
hung	1
their	1
heads	1
sideways,	1
as	1
the	1
two	1
crucified	1
thieves	1
are	1
drawn.	1
"'My	1
wrist	1
is	1
sprained	1
with	1
ye!'	1
he	1
cried,	1
at	1
last;	1
'but	1
there	1
is	1
still	1
rope	1
enough	1
left	1
for	1
you,	1
my	1
fine	1
bantam,	1
that	1
wouldn't	1
give	1
up.	1
Take	1
that	1
gag	1
from	1
his	1
mouth,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
hear	1
what	1
he	1
can	1
say	1
for	1
himself.'	1
"For	1
a	1
moment	1
the	1
exhausted	1
mutineer	1
made	1
a	1
tremulous	1
motion	1
of	1
his	1
cramped	1
jaws,	1
and	1
then	1
painfully	1
twisting	1
round	1
his	1
head,	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
hiss,	1
'What	1
I	1
say	1
is	1
this--and	1
mind	1
it	1
well--if	1
you	1
flog	1
me,	1
I	1
murder	1
you!'	1
"'Say	1
ye	1
so?	1
then	1
see	1
how	1
ye	1
frighten	1
me'--and	1
the	1
Captain	1
drew	1
off	1
with	1
the	1
rope	1
to	1
strike.	1
"'Best	1
not,'	1
hissed	1
the	1
Lakeman.	1
"'But	1
I	1
must,'--and	1
the	1
rope	1
was	1
once	1
more	1
drawn	1
back	1
for	1
the	1
stroke.	1
"Steelkilt	1
here	1
hissed	1
out	1
something,	1
inaudible	1
to	1
all	1
but	1
the	1
Captain;	1
who,	1
to	1
the	1
amazement	1
of	1
all	1
hands,	1
started	1
back,	1
paced	1
the	1
deck	1
rapidly	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
times,	1
and	1
then	1
suddenly	1
throwing	1
down	1
his	1
rope,	1
said,	1
'I	1
won't	1
do	1
it--let	1
him	1
go--cut	1
him	1
down:	1
d'ye	1
hear?'	1
But	1
as	1
the	1
junior	1
mates	1
were	1
hurrying	1
to	1
execute	1
the	1
order,	1
a	1
pale	1
man,	1
with	1
a	1
bandaged	1
head,	1
arrested	1
them--Radney	1
the	1
chief	1
mate.	1
Ever	1
since	1
the	1
blow,	1
he	1
had	1
lain	1
in	1
his	1
berth;	1
but	1
that	1
morning,	1
hearing	1
the	1
tumult	1
on	1
the	1
deck,	1
he	1
had	1
crept	1
out,	1
and	1
thus	1
far	1
had	1
watched	1
the	1
whole	1
scene.	1
Such	1
was	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
his	1
mouth,	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
hardly	1
speak;	1
but	1
mumbling	1
something	1
about	1
his	1
being	1
willing	1
and	1
able	1
to	1
do	1
what	1
the	1
captain	1
dared	1
not	1
attempt,	1
he	1
snatched	1
the	1
rope	1
and	1
advanced	1
to	1
his	1
pinioned	1
foe.	1
"'You	1
are	1
a	1
coward!'	1
hissed	1
the	1
Lakeman.	1
"'So	1
I	1
am,	1
but	1
take	1
that.'	1
The	1
mate	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
act	1
of	1
striking,	1
when	1
another	1
hiss	1
stayed	1
his	1
uplifted	1
arm.	1
He	1
paused:	1
and	1
then	1
pausing	1
no	1
more,	1
made	1
good	1
his	1
word,	1
spite	1
of	1
Steelkilt's	1
threat,	1
whatever	1
that	1
might	1
have	1
been.	1
The	1
three	1
men	1
were	1
then	1
cut	1
down,	1
all	1
hands	1
were	1
turned	1
to,	1
and,	1
sullenly	1
worked	1
by	1
the	1
moody	1
seamen,	1
the	1
iron	1
pumps	1
clanged	1
as	1
before.	1
"Just	1
after	1
dark	1
that	1
day,	1
when	1
one	1
watch	1
had	1
retired	1
below,	1
a	1
clamor	1
was	1
heard	1
in	1
the	1
forecastle;	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
trembling	1
traitors	1
running	1
up,	1
besieged	1
the	1
cabin	1
door,	1
saying	1
they	1
durst	1
not	1
consort	1
with	1
the	1
crew.	1
Entreaties,	1
cuffs,	1
and	1
kicks	1
could	1
not	1
drive	1
them	1
back,	1
so	1
at	1
their	1
own	1
instance	1
they	1
were	1
put	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
ship's	1
run	1
for	1
salvation.	1
Still,	1
no	1
sign	1
of	1
mutiny	1
reappeared	1
among	1
the	1
rest.	1
On	1
the	1
contrary,	1
it	1
seemed,	1
that	1
mainly	1
at	1
Steelkilt's	1
instigation,	1
they	1
had	1
resolved	1
to	1
maintain	1
the	1
strictest	1
peacefulness,	1
obey	1
all	1
orders	1
to	1
the	1
last,	1
and,	1
when	1
the	1
ship	1
reached	1
port,	1
desert	1
her	1
in	1
a	1
body.	1
But	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
insure	1
the	1
speediest	1
end	1
to	1
the	1
voyage,	1
they	1
all	1
agreed	1
to	1
another	1
thing--namely,	1
not	1
to	1
sing	1
out	1
for	1
whales,	1
in	1
case	1
any	1
should	1
be	1
discovered.	1
For,	1
spite	1
of	1
her	1
leak,	1
and	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
her	1
other	1
perils,	1
the	1
Town-Ho	1
still	1
maintained	1
her	1
mast-heads,	1
and	1
her	1
captain	1
was	1
just	1
as	1
willing	1
to	1
lower	1
for	1
a	1
fish	1
that	1
moment,	1
as	1
on	1
the	1
day	1
his	1
craft	1
first	1
struck	1
the	1
cruising	1
ground;	1
and	1
Radney	1
the	1
mate	1
was	1
quite	1
as	1
ready	1
to	1
change	1
his	1
berth	1
for	1
a	1
boat,	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
bandaged	1
mouth	1
seek	1
to	1
gag	1
in	1
death	1
the	1
vital	1
jaw	1
of	1
the	1
whale.	1
"But	1
though	1
the	1
Lakeman	1
had	1
induced	1
the	1
seamen	1
to	1
adopt	1
this	1
sort	1
of	1
passiveness	1
in	1
their	1
conduct,	1
he	1
kept	1
his	1
own	1
counsel	1
(at	1
least	1
till	1
all	1
was	1
over)	1
concerning	1
his	1
own	1
proper	1
and	1
private	1
revenge	1
upon	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
stung	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
ventricles	1
of	1
his	1
heart.	1
He	1
was	1
in	1
Radney	1
the	1
chief	1
mate's	1
watch;	1
and	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
infatuated	1
man	1
sought	1
to	1
run	1
more	1
than	1
half	1
way	1
to	1
meet	1
his	1
doom,	1
after	1
the	1
scene	1
at	1
the	1
rigging,	1
he	1
insisted,	1
against	1
the	1
express	1
counsel	1
of	1
the	1
captain,	1
upon	1
resuming	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
his	1
watch	1
at	1
night.	1
Upon	1
this,	1
and	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
other	1
circumstances,	1
Steelkilt	1
systematically	1
built	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
his	1
revenge.	1
"During	1
the	1
night,	1
Radney	1
had	1
an	1
unseamanlike	1
way	1
of	1
sitting	1
on	1
the	1
bulwarks	1
of	1
the	1
quarter-deck,	1
and	1
leaning	1
his	1
arm	1
upon	1
the	1
gunwale	1
of	1
the	1
boat	1
which	1
was	1
hoisted	1
up	1
there,	1
a	1
little	1
above	1
the	1
ship's	1
side.	1
In	1
this	1
attitude,	1
it	1
was	1
well	1
known,	1
he	1
sometimes	1
dozed.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
considerable	1
vacancy	1
between	1
the	1
boat	1
and	1
the	1
ship,	1
and	1
down	1
between	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
sea.	1
Steelkilt	1
calculated	1
his	1
time,	1
and	1
found	1
that	1
his	1
next	1
trick	1
at	1
the	1
helm	1
would	1
come	1
round	1
at	1
two	1
o'clock,	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
of	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
from	1
that	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
betrayed.	1
At	1
his	1
leisure,	1
he	1
employed	1
the	1
interval	1
in	1
braiding	1
something	1
very	1
carefully	1
in	1
his	1
watches	1
below.	1
"'What	1
are	1
you	1
making	1
there?'	1
said	1
a	1
shipmate.	1
"'What	1
do	1
you	1
think?	1
what	1
does	1
it	1
look	1
like?'	1
"'Like	1
a	1
lanyard	1
for	1
your	1
bag;	1
but	1
it's	1
an	1
odd	1
one,	1
seems	1
to	1
me.'	1
'Yes,	1
rather	1
oddish,'	1
said	1
the	1
Lakeman,	1
holding	1
it	1
at	1
arm's	1
length	1
before	1
him;	1
'but	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
will	1
answer.	1
Shipmate,	1
I	1
haven't	1
enough	1
twine,--have	1
you	1
any?'	1
"But	1
there	1
was	1
none	1
in	1
the	1
forecastle.	1
"'Then	1
I	1
must	1
get	1
some	1
from	1
old	1
Rad;'	1
and	1
he	1
rose	1
to	1
go	1
aft.	1
"'You	1
don't	1
mean	1
to	1
go	1
a	1
begging	1
to	1
HIM!'	1
said	1
a	1
sailor.	1
"'Why	1
not?	1
Do	1
you	1
think	1
he	1
won't	1
do	1
me	1
a	1
turn,	1
when	1
it's	1
to	1
help	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
end,	1
shipmate?'	1
and	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
mate,	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
quietly,	1
and	1
asked	1
him	1
for	1
some	1
twine	1
to	1
mend	1
his	1
hammock.	1
It	1
was	1
given	1
him--neither	1
twine	1
nor	1
lanyard	1
were	1
seen	1
again;	1
but	1
the	1
next	1
night	1
an	1
iron	1
ball,	1
closely	1
netted,	1
partly	1
rolled	1
from	1
the	1
pocket	1
of	1
the	1
Lakeman's	1
monkey	1
jacket,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
tucking	1
the	1
coat	1
into	1
his	1
hammock	1
for	1
a	1
pillow.	1
Twenty-four	1
hours	1
after,	1
his	1
trick	1
at	1
the	1
silent	1
helm--nigh	1
to	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
was	1
apt	1
to	1
doze	1
over	1
the	1
grave	1
always	1
ready	1
dug	1
to	1
the	1
seaman's	1
hand--that	1
fatal	1
hour	1
was	1
then	1
to	1
come;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
fore-ordaining	1
soul	1
of	1
Steelkilt,	1
the	1
mate	1
was	1
already	1
stark	1
and	1
stretched	1
as	1
a	1
corpse,	1
with	1
his	1
forehead	1
crushed	1
in.	1
"But,	1
gentlemen,	1
a	1
fool	1
saved	1
the	1
would-be	1
murderer	1
from	1
the	1
bloody	1
deed	1
he	1
had	1
planned.	1
Yet	1
complete	1
revenge	1
he	1
had,	1
and	1
without	1
being	1
the	1
avenger.	1
For	1
by	1
a	1
mysterious	1
fatality,	1
Heaven	1
itself	1
seemed	1
to	1
step	1
in	1
to	1
take	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
hands	1
into	1
its	1
own	1
the	1
damning	1
thing	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
done.	1
"It	1
was	1
just	1
between	1
daybreak	1
and	1
sunrise	1
of	1
the	1
morning	1
of	1
the	1
second	1
day,	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
washing	1
down	1
the	1
decks,	1
that	1
a	1
stupid	1
Teneriffe	1
man,	1
drawing	1
water	1
in	1
the	1
main-chains,	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
shouted	1
out,	1
'There	1
she	1
rolls!	1
there	1
she	1
rolls!'	1
Jesu,	1
what	1
a	1
whale!	1
It	1
was	1
Moby	1
Dick.	1
"'Moby	1
Dick!'	1
cried	1
Don	1
Sebastian;	1
'St.	1
Dominic!	1
Sir	1
sailor,	1
but	1
do	1
whales	1
have	1
christenings?	1
Whom	1
call	1
you	1
Moby	1
Dick?'	1
"'A	1
very	1
white,	1
and	1
famous,	1
and	1
most	1
deadly	1
immortal	1
monster,	1
Don;--but	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
too	1
long	1
a	1
story.'	1
"'How?	1
how?'	1
cried	1
all	1
the	1
young	1
Spaniards,	1
crowding.	1
"'Nay,	1
Dons,	1
Dons--nay,	1
nay!	1
I	1
cannot	1
rehearse	1
that	1
now.	1
Let	1
me	1
get	1
more	1
into	1
the	1
air,	1
Sirs.'	1
"'The	1
chicha!	1
the	1
chicha!'	1
cried	1
Don	1
Pedro;	1
'our	1
vigorous	1
friend	1
looks	1
faint;--fill	1
up	1
his	1
empty	1
glass!'	1
"No	1
need,	1
gentlemen;	1
one	1
moment,	1
and	1
I	1
proceed.--Now,	1
gentlemen,	1
so	1
suddenly	1
perceiving	1
the	1
snowy	1
whale	1
within	1
fifty	1
yards	1
of	1
the	1
ship--forgetful	1
of	1
the	1
compact	1
among	1
the	1
crew--in	1
the	1
excitement	1
of	1
the	1
moment,	1
the	1
Teneriffe	1
man	1
had	1
instinctively	1
and	1
involuntarily	1
lifted	1
his	1
voice	1
for	1
the	1
monster,	1
though	1
for	1
some	1
little	1
time	1
past	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
plainly	1
beheld	1
from	1
the	1
three	1
sullen	1
mast-heads.	1
All	1
was	1
now	1
a	1
phrensy.	1
'The	1
White	1
Whale--the	1
White	1
Whale!'	1
was	1
the	1
cry	1
from	1
captain,	1
mates,	1
and	1
harpooneers,	1
who,	1
undeterred	1
by	1
fearful	1
rumours,	1
were	1
all	1
anxious	1
to	1
capture	1
so	1
famous	1
and	1
precious	1
a	1
fish;	1
while	1
the	1
dogged	1
crew	1
eyed	1
askance,	1
and	1
with	1
curses,	1
the	1
appalling	1
beauty	1
of	1
the	1
vast	1
milky	1
mass,	1
that	1
lit	1
up	1
by	1
a	1
horizontal	1
spangling	1
sun,	1
shifted	1
and	1
glistened	1
like	1
a	1
living	1
opal	1
in	1
the	1
blue	1
morning	1
sea.	1
Gentlemen,	1
a	1
strange	1
fatality	1
pervades	1
the	1
whole	1
career	1
of	1
these	1
events,	1
as	1
if	1
verily	1
mapped	1
out	1
before	1
the	1
world	1
itself	1
was	1
charted.	1
The	1
mutineer	1
was	1
the	1
bowsman	1
of	1
the	1
mate,	1
and	1
when	1
fast	1
to	1
a	1
fish,	1
it	1
was	1
his	1
duty	1
to	1
sit	1
next	1
him,	1
while	1
Radney	1
stood	1
up	1
with	1
his	1
lance	1
in	1
the	1
prow,	1
and	1
haul	1
in	1
or	1
slacken	1
the	1
line,	1
at	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
command.	1
Moreover,	1
when	1
the	1
four	1
boats	1
were	1
lowered,	1
the	1
mate's	1
got	1
the	1
start;	1
and	1
none	1
howled	1
more	1
fiercely	1
with	1
delight	1
than	1
did	1
Steelkilt,	1
as	1
he	1
strained	1
at	1
his	1
oar.	1
After	1
a	1
stiff	1
pull,	1
their	1
harpooneer	1
got	1
fast,	1
and,	1
spear	1
in	1
hand,	1
Radney	1
sprang	1
to	1
the	1
bow.	1
He	1
was	1
always	1
a	1
furious	1
man,	1
it	1
seems,	1
in	1
a	1
boat.	1
And	1
now	1
his	1
bandaged	1
cry	1
was,	1
to	1
beach	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
whale's	1
topmost	1
back.	1
Nothing	1
loath,	1
his	1
bowsman	1
hauled	1
him	1
up	1
and	1
up,	1
through	1
a	1
blinding	1
foam	1
that	1
blent	1
two	1
whitenesses	1
together;	1
till	1
of	1
a	1
sudden	1
the	1
boat	1
struck	1
as	1
against	1
a	1
sunken	1
ledge,	1
and	1
keeling	1
over,	1
spilled	1
out	1
the	1
standing	1
mate.	1
That	1
instant,	1
as	1
he	1
fell	1
on	1
the	1
whale's	1
slippery	1
back,	1
the	1
boat	1
righted,	1
and	1
was	1
dashed	1
aside	1
by	1
the	1
swell,	1
while	1
Radney	1
was	1
tossed	1
over	1
into	1
the	1
sea,	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
flank	1
of	1
the	1
whale.	1
He	1
struck	1
out	1
through	1
the	1
spray,	1
and,	1
for	1
an	1
instant,	1
was	1
dimly	1
seen	1
through	1
that	1
veil,	1
wildly	1
seeking	1
to	1
remove	1
himself	1
from	1
the	1
eye	1
of	1
Moby	1
Dick.	1
But	1
the	1
whale	1
rushed	1
round	1
in	1
a	1
sudden	1
maelstrom;	1
seized	1
the	1
swimmer	1
between	1
his	1
jaws;	1
and	1
rearing	1
high	1
up	1
with	1
him,	1
plunged	1
headlong	1
again,	1
and	1
went	1
down.	1
"Meantime,	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
tap	1
of	1
the	1
boat's	1
bottom,	1
the	1
Lakeman	1
had	1
slackened	1
the	1
line,	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
drop	1
astern	1
from	1
the	1
whirlpool;	1
calmly	1
looking	1
on,	1
he	1
thought	1
his	1
own	1
thoughts.	1
But	1
a	1
sudden,	1
terrific,	1
downward	1
jerking	1
of	1
the	1
boat,	1
quickly	1
brought	1
his	1
knife	1
to	1
the	1
line.	1
He	1
cut	1
it;	1
and	1
the	1
whale	1
was	1
free.	1
But,	1
at	1
some	1
distance,	1
Moby	1
Dick	1
rose	1
again,	1
with	1
some	1
tatters	1
of	1
Radney's	1
red	1
woollen	1
shirt,	1
caught	1
in	1
the	1
teeth	1
that	1
had	1
destroyed	1
him.	1
All	1
four	1
boats	1
gave	1
chase	1
again;	1
but	1
the	1
whale	1
eluded	1
them,	1
and	1
finally	1
wholly	1
disappeared.	1
"In	1
good	1
time,	1
the	1
Town-Ho	1
reached	1
her	1
port--a	1
savage,	1
solitary	1
place--where	1
no	1
civilized	1
creature	1
resided.	1
There,	1
headed	1
by	1
the	1
Lakeman,	1
all	1
but	1
five	1
or	1
six	1
of	1
the	1
foremastmen	1
deliberately	1
deserted	1
among	1
the	1
palms;	1
eventually,	1
as	1
it	1
turned	1
out,	1
seizing	1
a	1
large	1
double	1
war-canoe	1
of	1
the	1
savages,	1
and	1
setting	1
sail	1
for	1
some	1
other	1
harbor.	1
"The	1
ship's	1
company	1
being	1
reduced	1
to	1
but	1
a	1
handful,	1
the	1
captain	1
called	1
upon	1
the	1
Islanders	1
to	1
assist	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
laborious	1
business	1
of	1
heaving	1
down	1
the	1
ship	1
to	1
stop	1
the	1
leak.	1
But	1
to	1
such	1
unresting	1
vigilance	1
over	1
their	1
dangerous	1
allies	1
was	1
this	1
small	1
band	1
of	1
whites	1
necessitated,	1
both	1
by	1
night	1
and	1
by	1
day,	1
and	1
so	1
extreme	1
was	1
the	1
hard	1
work	1
they	1
underwent,	1
that	1
upon	1
the	1
vessel	1
being	1
ready	1
again	1
for	1
sea,	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
weakened	1
condition	1
that	1
the	1
captain	1
durst	1
not	1
put	1
off	1
with	1
them	1
in	1
so	1
heavy	1
a	1
vessel.	1
After	1
taking	1
counsel	1
with	1
his	1
officers,	1
he	1
anchored	1
the	1
ship	1
as	1
far	1
off	1
shore	1
as	1
possible;	1
loaded	1
and	1
ran	1
out	1
his	1
two	1
cannon	1
from	1
the	1
bows;	1
stacked	1
his	1
muskets	1
on	1
the	1
poop;	1
and	1
warning	1
the	1
Islanders	1
not	1
to	1
approach	1
the	1
ship	1
at	1
their	1
peril,	1
took	1
one	1
man	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
setting	1
the	1
sail	1
of	1
his	1
best	1
whale-boat,	1
steered	1
straight	1
before	1
the	1
wind	1
for	1
Tahiti,	1
five	1
hundred	1
miles	1
distant,	1
to	1
procure	1
a	1
reinforcement	1
to	1
his	1
crew.	1
"On	1
the	1
fourth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
sail,	1
a	1
large	1
canoe	1
was	1
descried,	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
touched	1
at	1
a	1
low	1
isle	1
of	1
corals.	1
He	1
steered	1
away	1
from	1
it;	1
but	1
the	1
savage	1
craft	1
bore	1
down	1
on	1
him;	1
and	1
soon	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
Steelkilt	1
hailed	1
him	1
to	1
heave	1
to,	1
or	1
he	1
would	1
run	1
him	1
under	1
water.	1
The	1
captain	1
presented	1
a	1
pistol.	1
With	1
one	1
foot	1
on	1
each	1
prow	1
of	1
the	1
yoked	1
war-canoes,	1
the	1
Lakeman	1
laughed	1
him	1
to	1
scorn;	1
assuring	1
him	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
pistol	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
clicked	1
in	1
the	1
lock,	1
he	1
would	1
bury	1
him	1
in	1
bubbles	1
and	1
foam.	1
"'What	1
do	1
you	1
want	1
of	1
me?'	1
cried	1
the	1
captain.	1
"'Where	1
are	1
you	1
bound?	1
and	1
for	1
what	1
are	1
you	1
bound?'	1
demanded	1
Steelkilt;	1
'no	1
lies.'	1
"'I	1
am	1
bound	1
to	1
Tahiti	1
for	1
more	1
men.'	1
"'Very	1
good.	1
Let	1
me	1
board	1
you	1
a	1
moment--I	1
come	1
in	1
peace.'	1
With	1
that	1
he	1
leaped	1
from	1
the	1
canoe,	1
swam	1
to	1
the	1
boat;	1
and	1
climbing	1
the	1
gunwale,	1
stood	1
face	1
to	1
face	1
with	1
the	1
captain.	1
"'Cross	1
your	1
arms,	1
sir;	1
throw	1
back	1
your	1
head.	1
Now,	1
repeat	1
after	1
me.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
Steelkilt	1
leaves	1
me,	1
I	1
swear	1
to	1
beach	1
this	1
boat	1
on	1
yonder	1
island,	1
and	1
remain	1
there	1
six	1
days.	1
If	1
I	1
do	1
not,	1
may	1
lightning	1
strike	1
me!'	1
"'A	1
pretty	1
scholar,'	1
laughed	1
the	1
Lakeman.	1
'Adios,	1
Senor!'	1
and	1
leaping	1
into	1
the	1
sea,	1
he	1
swam	1
back	1
to	1
his	1
comrades.	1
"Watching	1
the	1
boat	1
till	1
it	1
was	1
fairly	1
beached,	1
and	1
drawn	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
roots	1
of	1
the	1
cocoa-nut	1
trees,	1
Steelkilt	1
made	1
sail	1
again,	1
and	1
in	1
due	1
time	1
arrived	1
at	1
Tahiti,	1
his	1
own	1
place	1
of	1
destination.	1
There,	1
luck	1
befriended	1
him;	1
two	1
ships	1
were	1
about	1
to	1
sail	1
for	1
France,	1
and	1
were	1
providentially	1
in	1
want	1
of	1
precisely	1
that	1
number	1
of	1
men	1
which	1
the	1
sailor	1
headed.	1
They	1
embarked;	1
and	1
so	1
for	1
ever	1
got	1
the	1
start	1
of	1
their	1
former	1
captain,	1
had	1
he	1
been	1
at	1
all	1
minded	1
to	1
work	1
them	1
legal	1
retribution.	1
"Some	1
ten	1
days	1
after	1
the	1
French	1
ships	1
sailed,	1
the	1
whale-boat	1
arrived,	1
and	1
the	1
captain	1
was	1
forced	1
to	1
enlist	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
more	1
civilized	1
Tahitians,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
somewhat	1
used	1
to	1
the	1
sea.	1
Chartering	1
a	1
small	1
native	1
schooner,	1
he	1
returned	1
with	1
them	1
to	1
his	1
vessel;	1
and	1
finding	1
all	1
right	1
there,	1
again	1
resumed	1
his	1
cruisings.	1
"Where	1
Steelkilt	1
now	1
is,	1
gentlemen,	1
none	1
know;	1
but	1
upon	1
the	1
island	1
of	1
Nantucket,	1
the	1
widow	1
of	1
Radney	1
still	1
turns	1
to	1
the	1
sea	1
which	1
refuses	1
to	1
give	1
up	1
its	1
dead;	1
still	1
in	1
dreams	1
sees	1
the	1
awful	1
white	1
whale	1
that	1
destroyed	1
him.	1
"'Are	1
you	1
through?'	1
said	1
Don	1
Sebastian,	1
quietly.	1
"'I	1
am,	1
Don.'	1
"'Then	1
I	1
entreat	1
you,	1
tell	1
me	1
if	1
to	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
your	1
own	1
convictions,	1
this	1
your	1
story	1
is	1
in	1
substance	1
really	1
true?	1
It	1
is	1
so	1
passing	1
wonderful!	1
Did	1
you	1
get	1
it	1
from	1
an	1
unquestionable	1
source?	1
Bear	1
with	1
me	1
if	1
I	1
seem	1
to	1
press.'	1
"'Also	1
bear	1
with	1
all	1
of	1
us,	1
sir	1
sailor;	1
for	1
we	1
all	1
join	1
in	1
Don	1
Sebastian's	1
suit,'	1
cried	1
the	1
company,	1
with	1
exceeding	1
interest.	1
"'Is	1
there	1
a	1
copy	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Evangelists	1
in	1
the	1
Golden	1
Inn,	1
gentlemen?'	1
"'Nay,'	1
said	1
Don	1
Sebastian;	1
'but	1
I	1
know	1
a	1
worthy	1
priest	1
near	1
by,	1
who	1
will	1
quickly	1
procure	1
one	1
for	1
me.	1
I	1
go	1
for	1
it;	1
but	1
are	1
you	1
well	1
advised?	1
this	1
may	1
grow	1
too	1
serious.'	1
"'Will	1
you	1
be	1
so	1
good	1
as	1
to	1
bring	1
the	1
priest	1
also,	1
Don?'	1
"'Though	1
there	1
are	1
no	1
Auto-da-Fe's	1
in	1
Lima	1
now,'	1
said	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
company	1
to	1
another;	1
'I	1
fear	1
our	1
sailor	1
friend	1
runs	1
risk	1
of	1
the	1
archiepiscopacy.	1
Let	1
us	1
withdraw	1
more	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
moonlight.	1
I	1
see	1
no	1
need	1
of	1
this.'	1
"'Excuse	1
me	1
for	1
running	1
after	1
you,	1
Don	1
Sebastian;	1
but	1
may	1
I	1
also	1
beg	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
particular	1
in	1
procuring	1
the	1
largest	1
sized	1
Evangelists	1
you	1
can.'	1
'This	1
is	1
the	1
priest,	1
he	1
brings	1
you	1
the	1
Evangelists,'	1
said	1
Don	1
Sebastian,	1
gravely,	1
returning	1
with	1
a	1
tall	1
and	1
solemn	1
figure.	1
"'Let	1
me	1
remove	1
my	1
hat.	1
Now,	1
venerable	1
priest,	1
further	1
into	1
the	1
light,	1

hold	1
the	1
Holy	1
Book	1
before	1
me	1
that	1

"'So	1

I	1

CHAPTER	1
55	1
Of	1
the	1
Monstrous	1
Pictures	1
of	1
Whales.	1
I	1
shall	1
ere	1
long	1
paint	1
to	1
you	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
one	1
can	1
without	1
canvas,	1
something	1
like	1
the	1
true	1
form	1
of	1
the	1
whale	1
as	1
he	1
actually	1
appears	1
to	1
the	1
eye	1
of	1
the	1
whaleman	1
when	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
absolute	1
body	1
the	1
whale	1
is	1
moored	1
alongside	1
the	1
whale-ship	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
can	1
be	1
fairly	1
stepped	1
upon	1
there.	1
It	1
may	1
be	1
worth	1
while,	1
therefore,	1
previously	1
to	1
advert	1
to	1
those	1
curious	1
imaginary	1
portraits	1
of	1
him	1
which	1
even	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
present	1
day	1
confidently	1
challenge	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
the	1
landsman.	1
It	1
is	1
time	1
to	1
set	1
the	1
world	1
right	1
in	1
this	1
matter,	1
by	1
proving	1
such	1
pictures	1
of	1
the	1
whale	1
all	1
wrong.	1
It	1
may	1
be	1
that	1
the	1
primal	1
source	1
of	1
all	1
those	1
pictorial	1
delusions	1
will	1
be	1
found	1
among	1
the	1
oldest	1
Hindoo,	1
Egyptian,	1
and	1
Grecian	1
sculptures.	1
For	1
ever	1
since	1
those	1
inventive	1
but	1
unscrupulous	1
times	1
when	1
on	1
the	1
marble	1
panellings	1
of	1
temples,	1
the	1
pedestals	1
of	1
statues,	1
and	1
on	1
shields,	1
medallions,	1
cups,	1
and	1
coins,	1
the	1
dolphin	1
was	1
drawn	1
in	1
scales	1
of	1
chain-armor	1
like	1
Saladin's,	1
and	1
a	1
helmeted	1
head	1
like	1
St.	1
George's;	1
ever	1
since	1
then	1
has	1
something	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
sort	1
of	1
license	1
prevailed,	1
not	1
only	1
in	1
most	1
popular	1
pictures	1
of	1
the	1
whale,	1
but	1
in	1
many	1
scientific	1
presentations	1
of	1
him.	1
Now,	1
by	1
all	1
odds,	1
the	1
most	1
ancient	1
extant	1
portrait	1
anyways	1
purporting	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
whale's,	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
famous	1
cavern-pagoda	1
of	1
Elephanta,	1
in	1
India.	1
The	1
Brahmins	1
maintain	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
almost	1
endless	1
sculptures	1
of	1
that	1
immemorial	1
pagoda,	1
all	1
the	1
trades	1
and	1
pursuits,	1
every	1
conceivable	1
avocation	1
of	1
man,	1
were	1
prefigured	1
ages	1
before	1
any	1
of	1
them	1
actually	1
came	1
into	1
being.	1
No	1
wonder	1
then,	1
that	1
in	1
some	1
sort	1
our	1
noble	1
profession	1
of	1
whaling	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
there	1
shadowed	1
forth.	1
The	1
Hindoo	1
whale	1
referred	1
to,	1
occurs	1
in	1
a	1
separate	1
department	1
of	1
the	1
wall,	1
depicting	1
the	1
incarnation	1
of	1
Vishnu	1
in	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
leviathan,	1
learnedly	1
known	1
as	1
the	1
Matse	1
Avatar.	1
But	1
though	1
this	1
sculpture	1
is	1
half	1
man	1
and	1
half	1
whale,	1
so	1
as	1
only	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
tail	1
of	1
the	1
latter,	1
yet	1
that	1
small	1
section	1
of	1
him	1
is	1
all	1
wrong.	1
It	1
looks	1
more	1
like	1
the	1
tapering	1
tail	1
of	1
an	1
anaconda,	1
than	1
the	1
broad	1
palms	1
of	1
the	1
true	1
whale's	1
majestic	1
flukes.	1
But	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
Galleries,	1
and	1
look	1
now	1
at	1
a	1
great	1
Christian	1
painter's	1
portrait	1
of	1
this	1
fish;	1
for	1
he	1
succeeds	1
no	1
better	1
than	1
the	1
antediluvian	1
Hindoo.	1
It	1
is	1
Guido's	1
picture	1
of	1
Perseus	1
rescuing	1
Andromeda	1
from	1
the	1
sea-monster	1
or	1
whale.	1
Where	1
did	1
Guido	1
get	1
the	1
model	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
strange	1
creature	1
as	1
that?	1
Nor	1
does	1
Hogarth,	1
in	1
painting	1
the	1
same	1
scene	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
"Perseus	1
Descending,"	1
make	1
out	1
one	1
whit	1
better.	1
The	1
huge	1
corpulence	1
of	1
that	1
Hogarthian	1
monster	1
undulates	1
on	1
the	1
surface,	1
scarcely	1
drawing	1
one	1
inch	1
of	1
water.	1
It	1
has	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
howdah	1
on	1
its	1
back,	1
and	1
its	1
distended	1
tusked	1
mouth	1
into	1
which	1
the	1
billows	1
are	1
rolling,	1
might	1
be	1
taken	1
for	1
the	1
Traitors'	1
Gate	1
leading	1
from	1
the	1
Thames	1
by	1
water	1
into	1
the	1
Tower.	1
Then,	1
there	1
are	1
the	1
Prodromus	1
whales	1
of	1
old	1
Scotch	1
Sibbald,	1
and	1
Jonah's	1
whale,	1
as	1
depicted	1
in	1
the	1
prints	1
of	1
old	1
Bibles	1
and	1
the	1
cuts	1
of	1
old	1
primers.	1
What	1
shall	1
be	1
said	1
of	1
these?	1
As	1
for	1
the	1
book-binder's	1
whale	1
winding	1
like	1
a	1
vine-stalk	1
round	1
the	1
stock	1
of	1
a	1
descending	1
anchor--as	1
stamped	1
and	1
gilded	1
on	1
the	1
backs	1
and	1
title-pages	1
of	1
many	1
books	1
both	1
old	1
and	1
new--that	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
picturesque	1
but	1
purely	1
fabulous	1
creature,	1
imitated,	1
I	1
take	1
it,	1
from	1
the	1
like	1
figures	1
on	1
antique	1
vases.	1
Though	1
universally	1
denominated	1
a	1
dolphin,	1
I	1
nevertheless	1
call	1
this	1
book-binder's	1
fish	1
an	1
attempt	1
at	1
a	1
whale;	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
intended	1
when	1
the	1
device	1
was	1
first	1
introduced.	1
It	1
was	1
introduced	1
by	1
an	1
old	1
Italian	1
publisher	1
somewhere	1
about	1
the	1
15th	1
century,	1
during	1
the	1
Revival	1
of	1
Learning;	1
and	1
in	1
those	1
days,	1
and	1
even	1
down	1
to	1
a	1
comparatively	1
late	1
period,	1
dolphins	1
were	1
popularly	1
supposed	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
species	1
of	1
the	1
Leviathan.	1
In	1
the	1
vignettes	1
and	1
other	1
embellishments	1
of	1
some	1
ancient	1
books	1
you	1
will	1
at	1
times	1
meet	1
with	1
very	1
curious	1
touches	1
at	1
the	1
whale,	1
where	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
spouts,	1
jets	1
d'eau,	1
hot	1
springs	1
and	1
cold,	1
Saratoga	1
and	1
Baden-Baden,	1
come	1
bubbling	1
up	1
from	1
his	1
unexhausted	1
brain.	1
In	1
the	1
title-page	1
of	1
the	1
original	1
edition	1
of	1
the	1
"Advancement	1
of	1
Learning"	1
you	1
will	1
find	1
some	1
curious	1
whales.	1
But	1
quitting	1
all	1
these	1
unprofessional	1
attempts,	1
let	1
us	1
glance	1
at	1
those	1
pictures	1
of	1
leviathan	1
purporting	1
to	1
be	1
sober,	1
scientific	1
delineations,	1
by	1
those	1
who	1
know.	1
In	1
old	1
Harris's	1
collection	1
of	1
voyages	1
there	1
are	1
some	1
plates	1
of	1
whales	1
extracted	1
from	1
a	1
Dutch	1
book	1
of	1
voyages,	1
A.D.	1
1671,	1
entitled	1
"A	1
Whaling	1
Voyage	1
to	1
Spitzbergen	1
in	1
the	1
ship	1
Jonas	1
in	1
the	1
Whale,	1
Peter	1
Peterson	1
of	1
Friesland,	1
master."	1
In	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
plates	1
the	1
whales,	1
like	1
great	1
rafts	1
of	1
logs,	1
are	1
represented	1
lying	1
among	1
ice-isles,	1
with	1
white	1
bears	1
running	1
over	1
their	1
living	1
backs.	1
In	1
another	1
plate,	1
the	1
prodigious	1
blunder	1
is	1
made	1
of	1
representing	1
the	1
whale	1
with	1
perpendicular	1
flukes.	1
Then	1
again,	1
there	1
is	1
an	1
imposing	1
quarto,	1
written	1
by	1
one	1
Captain	1
Colnett,	1
a	1
Post	1
Captain	1
in	1
the	1
English	1
navy,	1
entitled	1
"A	1
Voyage	1
round	1
Cape	1
Horn	1
into	1
the	1
South	1
Seas,	1
for	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
extending	1
the	1
Spermaceti	1
Whale	1
Fisheries."	1
In	1
this	1
book	1
is	1
an	1
outline	1
purporting	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
"Picture	1
of	1
a	1
Physeter	1
or	1
Spermaceti	1
whale,	1
drawn	1
by	1
scale	1
from	1
one	1
killed	1
on	1
the	1
coast	1
of	1
Mexico,	1
August,	1
1793,	1
and	1
hoisted	1
on	1
deck."	1
I	1
doubt	1
not	1
the	1
captain	1
had	1
this	1
veracious	1
picture	1
taken	1
for	1
the	1
benefit	1
of	1
his	1
marines.	1
To	1
mention	1
but	1
one	1
thing	1
about	1
it,	1
let	1
me	1
say	1
that	1
it	1
has	1
an	1
eye	1
which	1
applied,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
accompanying	1
scale,	1
to	1
a	1
full	1
grown	1
sperm	1
whale,	1
would	1
make	1
the	1
eye	1
of	1
that	1
whale	1
a	1
bow-window	1
some	1
five	1
feet	1
long.	1
Ah,	1
my	1
gallant	1
captain,	1
why	1
did	1
ye	1
not	1
give	1
us	1
Jonah	1
looking	1
out	1
of	1
that	1
eye!	1
Nor	1
are	1
the	1
most	1
conscientious	1
compilations	1
of	1
Natural	1
History	1
for	1
the	1
benefit	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
and	1
tender,	1
free	1
from	1
the	1
same	1
heinousness	1
of	1
mistake.	1
Look	1
at	1
that	1
popular	1
work	1
"Goldsmith's	1
Animated	1
Nature."	1
In	1
the	1
abridged	1
London	1
edition	1
of	1
1807,	1
there	1
are	1
plates	1
of	1
an	1
alleged	1
"whale"	1
and	1
a	1
"narwhale."	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
seem	1
inelegant,	1
but	1
this	1
unsightly	1
whale	1
looks	1
much	1
like	1
an	1
amputated	1
sow;	1
and,	1
as	1
for	1
the	1
narwhale,	1
one	1
glimpse	1
at	1
it	1
is	1
enough	1
to	1
amaze	1
one,	1
that	1
in	1
this	1
nineteenth	1
century	1
such	1
a	1
hippogriff	1
could	1
be	1
palmed	1
for	1
genuine	1
upon	1
any	1
intelligent	1
public	1
of	1
schoolboys.	1
Then,	1
again,	1
in	1
1825,	1
Bernard	1
Germain,	1
Count	1
de	1
Lacepede,	1
a	1
great	1
naturalist,	1
published	1
a	1
scientific	1
systemized	1
whale	1
book,	1
wherein	1
are	1
several	1
pictures	1
of	1
the	1
different	1
species	1
of	1
the	1
Leviathan.	1
All	1
these	1
are	1
not	1
only	1
incorrect,	1
but	1
the	1
picture	1
of	1
the	1
Mysticetus	1
or	1
Greenland	1
whale	1
(that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
the	1
Right	1
whale),	1
even	1
Scoresby,	1
a	1
long	1
experienced	1
man	1
as	1
touching	1
that	1
species,	1
declares	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
its	1
counterpart	1
in	1
nature.	1
But	1
the	1
placing	1
of	1
the	1
cap-sheaf	1
to	1
all	1
this	1
blundering	1
business	1
was	1
reserved	1
for	1
the	1
scientific	1
Frederick	1
Cuvier,	1
brother	1
to	1
the	1
famous	1
Baron.	1
In	1
1836,	1
he	1
published	1
a	1
Natural	1
History	1
of	1
Whales,	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
gives	1
what	1
he	1
calls	1
a	1
picture	1
of	1
the	1
Sperm	1
Whale.	1
Before	1
showing	1
that	1
picture	1
to	1
any	1
Nantucketer,	1
you	1
had	1
best	1
provide	1
for	1
your	1
summary	1
retreat	1
from	1
Nantucket.	1
In	1
a	1
word,	1
Frederick	1
Cuvier's	1
Sperm	1
Whale	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
Sperm	1
Whale,	1
but	1
a	1
squash.	1
Of	1
course,	1
he	1
never	1
had	1
the	1
benefit	1
of	1
a	1
whaling	1
voyage	1
(such	1
men	1
seldom	1
have),	1
but	1
whence	1
he	1
derived	1
that	1
picture,	1
who	1
can	1
tell?	1
Perhaps	1
he	1
got	1
it	1
as	1
his	1
scientific	1
predecessor	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
field,	1
Desmarest,	1
got	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
authentic	1
abortions;	1
that	1
is,	1
from	1
a	1
Chinese	1
drawing.	1
And	1
what	1
sort	1
of	1
lively	1
lads	1
with	1
the	1
pencil	1
those	1
Chinese	1
are,	1
many	1
queer	1
cups	1
and	1
saucers	1
inform	1
us.	1
As	1
for	1
the	1
sign-painters'	1
whales	1
seen	1
in	1
the	1
streets	1
hanging	1
over	1
the	1
shops	1
of	1
oil-dealers,	1
what	1
shall	1
be	1
said	1
of	1
them?	1
They	1
are	1
generally	1
Richard	1
III.	1
whales,	1
with	1
dromedary	1
humps,	1
and	1
very	1
savage;	1
breakfasting	1
on	1
three	1
or	1
four	1
sailor	1
tarts,	1
that	1
is	1
whaleboats	1
full	1
of	1
mariners:	1
their	1
deformities	1
floundering	1
in	1
seas	1
of	1
blood	1
and	1
blue	1
paint.	1
But	1
these	1
manifold	1
mistakes	1
in	1
depicting	1
the	1
whale	1
are	1
not	1
so	1
very	1
surprising	1
after	1
all.	1
Consider!	1
Most	1
of	1
the	1
scientific	1
drawings	1
have	1
been	1
taken	1
from	1
the	1
stranded	1
fish;	1
and	1
these	1
are	1
about	1
as	1
correct	1
as	1
a	1
drawing	1
of	1
a	1
wrecked	1
ship,	1
with	1
broken	1
back,	1
would	1
correctly	1
represent	1
the	1
noble	1
animal	1
itself	1
in	1
all	1
its	1
undashed	1
pride	1
of	1
hull	1
and	1
spars.	1
Though	1
elephants	1
have	1
stood	1
for	1
their	1
full-lengths,	1
the	1
living	1
Leviathan	1
has	1
never	1
yet	1
fairly	1
floated	1
himself	1
for	1
his	1
portrait.	1
The	1
living	1
whale,	1
in	1
his	1
full	1
majesty	1
and	1
significance,	1
is	1
only	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
at	1
sea	1
in	1
unfathomable	1
waters;	1
and	1
afloat	1
the	1
vast	1
bulk	1
of	1
him	1
is	1
out	1
of	1
sight,	1
like	1
a	1
launched	1
line-of-battle	1
ship;	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
that	1
element	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
thing	1
eternally	1
impossible	1
for	1
mortal	1
man	1
to	1
hoist	1
him	1
bodily	1
into	1
the	1
air,	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
preserve	1
all	1
his	1
mighty	1
swells	1
and	1
undulations.	1
And,	1
not	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
the	1
highly	1
presumable	1
difference	1
of	1
contour	1
between	1
a	1
young	1
sucking	1
whale	1
and	1
a	1
full-grown	1
Platonian	1
Leviathan;	1
yet,	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
young	1
sucking	1
whales	1
hoisted	1
to	1
a	1
ship's	1
deck,	1
such	1
is	1
then	1
the	1
outlandish,	1
eel-like,	1
limbered,	1
varying	1
shape	1
of	1
him,	1
that	1
his	1
precise	1
expression	1
the	1
devil	1
himself	1
could	1
not	1
catch.	1
But	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
fancied,	1
that	1
from	1
the	1
naked	1
skeleton	1
of	1
the	1
stranded	1
whale,	1
accurate	1
hints	1
may	1
be	1
derived	1
touching	1
his	1
true	1
form.	1
Not	1
at	1
all.	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
more	1
curious	1
things	1
about	1
this	1
Leviathan,	1
that	1
his	1
skeleton	1
gives	1
very	1
little	1
idea	1
of	1
his	1
general	1
shape.	1
Though	1
Jeremy	1
Bentham's	1
skeleton,	1
which	1
hangs	1
for	1
candelabra	1
in	1
the	1
library	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
executors,	1
correctly	1
conveys	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
a	1
burly-browed	1
utilitarian	1
old	1
gentleman,	1
with	1
all	1
Jeremy's	1
other	1
leading	1
personal	1
characteristics;	1
yet	1
nothing	1
of	1
this	1
kind	1
could	1
be	1
inferred	1
from	1
any	1
leviathan's	1
articulated	1
bones.	1
In	1
fact,	1
as	1
the	1
great	1
Hunter	1
says,	1
the	1
mere	1
skeleton	1
of	1
the	1
whale	1
bears	1
the	1
same	1
relation	1
to	1
the	1
fully	1
invested	1
and	1
padded	1
animal	1
as	1
the	1
insect	1
does	1
to	1
the	1
chrysalis	1
that	1
so	1
roundingly	1
envelopes	1
it.	1
This	1
peculiarity	1
is	1
strikingly	1
evinced	1
in	1
the	1
head,	1
as	1
in	1
some	1
part	1
of	1
this	1
book	1
will	1
be	1
incidentally	1
shown.	1
It	1
is	1
also	1
very	1
curiously	1
displayed	1
in	1
the	1
side	1
fin,	1
the	1
bones	1
of	1
which	1
almost	1
exactly	1
answer	1
to	1
the	1
bones	1
of	1
the	1
human	1
hand,	1
minus	1
only	1
the	1
thumb.	1
This	1
fin	1
has	1
four	1
regular	1
bone-fingers,	1
the	1
index,	1
middle,	1
ring,	1
and	1
little	1
finger.	1
But	1
all	1
these	1
are	1
permanently	1
lodged	1
in	1
their	1
fleshy	1
covering,	1
as	1
the	1
human	1
fingers	1
in	1
an	1
artificial	1
covering.	1
"However	1
recklessly	1
the	1
whale	1
may	1
sometimes	1
serve	1
us,"	1
said	1
humorous	1
Stubb	1
one	1
day,	1
"he	1
can	1
never	1
be	1
truly	1
said	1
to	1
handle	1
us	1
without	1
mittens."	1
For	1
all	1
these	1
reasons,	1
then,	1
any	1
way	1
you	1
may	1
look	1
at	1
it,	1
you	1
must	1
needs	1
conclude	1
that	1
the	1
great	1
Leviathan	1
is	1
that	1
one	1
creature	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
which	1
must	1
remain	1
unpainted	1
to	1
the	1
last.	1
True,	1
one	1
portrait	1
may	1
hit	1
the	1
mark	1
much	1
nearer	1
than	1
another,	1
but	1
none	1
can	1
hit	1
it	1
with	1
any	1
very	1
considerable	1
degree	1
of	1
exactness.	1
So	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
earthly	1
way	1
of	1
finding	1
out	1
precisely	1
what	1
the	1
whale	1
really	1
looks	1
like.	1
And	1
the	1
only	1
mode	1
in	1
which	1
you	1
can	1
derive	1
even	1
a	1
tolerable	1
idea	1
of	1
his	1
living	1
contour,	1
is	1
by	1
going	1
a	1
whaling	1
yourself;	1
but	1
by	1
so	1
doing,	1
you	1
run	1
no	1
small	1
risk	1
of	1
being	1
eternally	1
stove	1
and	1
sunk	1
by	1
him.	1
Wherefore,	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
you	1
had	1
best	1
not	1
be	1
too	1
fastidious	1
in	1
your	1
curiosity	1
touching	1
this	1
Leviathan.	1
CHAPTER	1
56	1
Of	1
the	1
Less	1
Erroneous	1
Pictures	1
of	1
Whales,	1
and	1
the	1
True	1
Pictures	1
of	1
Whaling	1
Scenes.	1
In	1
connexion	1
with	1
the	1
monstrous	1
pictures	1
of	1
whales,	1
I	1
am	1
strongly	1
tempted	1
here	1
to	1
enter	1
upon	1
those	1
still	1
more	1
monstrous	1
stories	1
of	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
certain	1
books,	1
both	1
ancient	1
and	1
modern,	1
especially	1
in	1
Pliny,	1
Purchas,	1
Hackluyt,	1
Harris,	1
Cuvier,	1
etc.	1
But	1
I	1
pass	1
that	1
matter	1
by.	1
I	1
know	1
of	1
only	1
four	1
published	1
outlines	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
Sperm	1
Whale;	1
Colnett's,	1
Huggins's,	1
Frederick	1
Cuvier's,	1
and	1
Beale's.	1
In	1
the	1
previous	1
chapter	1
Colnett	1
and	1
Cuvier	1
have	1
been	1
referred	1
to.	1
Huggins's	1
is	1
far	1
better	1
than	1
theirs;	1
but,	1
by	1
great	1
odds,	1
Beale's	1
is	1
the	1
best.	1
All	1
Beale's	1
drawings	1
of	1
this	1
whale	1
are	1
good,	1
excepting	1
the	1
middle	1
figure	1
in	1
the	1
picture	1
of	1
three	1
whales	1
in	1
various	1
attitudes,	1
capping	1
his	1
second	1
chapter.	1
His	1
frontispiece,	1
boats	1
attacking	1
Sperm	1
Whales,	1
though	1
no	1
doubt	1
calculated	1
to	1
excite	1
the	1
civil	1
scepticism	1
of	1
some	1
parlor	1
men,	1
is	1
admirably	1
correct	1
and	1
life-like	1
in	1
its	1
general	1
effect.	1
Some	1
of	1
the	1
Sperm	1
Whale	1
drawings	1
in	1
J.	1
Ross	1
Browne	1
are	1
pretty	1
correct	1
in	1
contour;	1
but	1
they	1
are	1
wretchedly	1
engraved.	1
That	1
is	1
not	1
his	1
fault	1
though.	1
Of	1
the	1
Right	1
Whale,	1
the	1
best	1
outline	1
pictures	1
are	1
in	1
Scoresby;	1
but	1
they	1
are	1
drawn	1
on	1
too	1
small	1
a	1
scale	1
to	1
convey	1
a	1
desirable	1
impression.	1
He	1
has	1
but	1
one	1
picture	1
of	1
whaling	1
scenes,	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
sad	1
deficiency,	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
by	1
such	1
pictures	1
only,	1
when	1
at	1
all	1
well	1
done,	1
that	1
you	1
can	1
derive	1
anything	1
like	1
a	1
truthful	1
idea	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
whale	1
as	1
seen	1
by	1
his	1
living	1
hunters.	1
But,	1
taken	1
for	1
all	1
in	1
all,	1
by	1
far	1
the	1
finest,	1
though	1
in	1
some	1
details	1
not	1
the	1
most	1
correct,	1
presentations	1
of	1
whales	1
and	1
whaling	1
scenes	1
to	1
be	1
anywhere	1
found,	1
are	1
two	1
large	1
French	1
engravings,	1
well	1
executed,	1
and	1
taken	1
from	1
paintings	1
by	1
one	1
Garnery.	1
Respectively,	1
they	1
represent	1
attacks	1
on	1
the	1
Sperm	1
and	1
Right	1
Whale.	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
engraving	1
a	1
noble	1
Sperm	1
Whale	1
is	1
depicted	1
in	1
full	1
majesty	1
of	1
might,	1
just	1
risen	1
beneath	1
the	1
boat	1
from	1
the	1
profundities	1
of	1
the	1
ocean,	1
and	1
bearing	1
high	1
in	1
the	1
air	1
upon	1
his	1
back	1
the	1
terrific	1
wreck	1
of	1
the	1
stoven	1
planks.	1
The	1
prow	1
of	1
the	1
boat	1
is	1
partially	1
unbroken,	1
and	1
is	1
drawn	1
just	1
balancing	1
upon	1
the	1
monster's	1
spine;	1
and	1
standing	1
in	1
that	1
prow,	1
for	1
that	1
one	1
single	1
incomputable	1
flash	1
of	1
time,	1
you	1
behold	1
an	1
oarsman,	1
half	1
shrouded	1
by	1
the	1
incensed	1
boiling	1
spout	1
of	1
the	1
whale,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
act	1
of	1
leaping,	1
as	1
if	1
from	1
a	1
precipice.	1
The	1
action	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
thing	1
is	1
wonderfully	1
good	1
and	1
true.	1
The	1
half-emptied	1
line-tub	1
floats	1
on	1
the	1
whitened	1
sea;	1
the	1
wooden	1
poles	1
of	1
the	1
spilled	1
harpoons	1
obliquely	1
bob	1
in	1
it;	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
the	1
swimming	1
crew	1
are	1
scattered	1
about	1
the	1
whale	1
in	1
contrasting	1
expressions	1
of	1
affright;	1
while	1
in	1
the	1
black	1
stormy	1
distance	1
the	1
ship	1
is	1
bearing	1
down	1
upon	1
the	1
scene.	1
Serious	1
fault	1
might	1
be	1
found	1
with	1
the	1
anatomical	1
details	1
of	1
this	1
whale,	1
but	1
let	1
that	1
pass;	1
since,	1
for	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
me,	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
draw	1
so	1
good	1
a	1
one.	1
In	1
the	1
second	1
engraving,	1
the	1
boat	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
act	1
of	1
drawing	1
alongside	1
the	1
barnacled	1
flank	1
of	1
a	1
large	1
running	1
Right	1
Whale,	1
that	1
rolls	1
his	1
black	1
weedy	1
bulk	1
in	1
the	1
sea	1
like	1
some	1
mossy	1
rock-slide	1
from	1
the	1
Patagonian	1
cliffs.	1
His	1
jets	1
are	1
erect,	1
full,	1
and	1
black	1
like	1
soot;	1
so	1
that	1
from	1
so	1
abounding	1
a	1
smoke	1
in	1
the	1
chimney,	1
you	1
would	1
think	1
there	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
brave	1
supper	1
cooking	1
in	1
the	1
great	1
bowels	1
below.	1
Sea	1
fowls	1
are	1
pecking	1
at	1
the	1
small	1
crabs,	1
shell-fish,	1
and	1
other	1
sea	1
candies	1
and	1
maccaroni,	1
which	1
the	1
Right	1
Whale	1
sometimes	1
carries	1
on	1
his	1
pestilent	1
back.	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
while	1
the	1
thick-lipped	1
leviathan	1
is	1
rushing	1
through	1
the	1
deep,	1
leaving	1
tons	1
of	1
tumultuous	1
white	1
curds	1
in	1
his	1
wake,	1
and	1
causing	1
the	1
slight	1
boat	1
to	1
rock	1
in	1
the	1
swells	1
like	1
a	1
skiff	1
caught	1
nigh	1
the	1
paddle-wheels	1
of	1
an	1
ocean	1
steamer.	1
Thus,	1
the	1
foreground	1
is	1
all	1
raging	1
commotion;	1
but	1
behind,	1
in	1
admirable	1
artistic	1
contrast,	1
is	1
the	1
glassy	1
level	1
of	1
a	1
sea	1
becalmed,	1
the	1
drooping	1
unstarched	1
sails	1
of	1
the	1
powerless	1
ship,	1
and	1
the	1
inert	1
mass	1
of	1
a	1
dead	1
whale,	1
a	1
conquered	1
fortress,	1
with	1
the	1
flag	1
of	1
capture	1
lazily	1
hanging	1
from	1
the	1
whale-pole	1
inserted	1
into	1
his	1
spout-hole.	1
Who	1
Garnery	1
the	1
painter	1
is,	1
or	1
was,	1
I	1
know	1
not.	1
But	1
my	1
life	1
for	1
it	1
he	1
was	1
either	1
practically	1
conversant	1
with	1
his	1
subject,	1
or	1
else	1
marvellously	1
tutored	1
by	1
some	1
experienced	1
whaleman.	1
The	1
French	1
are	1
the	1
lads	1
for	1
painting	1
action.	1
Go	1
and	1
gaze	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
paintings	1
of	1
Europe,	1
and	1
where	1
will	1
you	1
find	1
such	1
a	1
gallery	1
of	1
living	1
and	1
breathing	1
commotion	1
on	1
canvas,	1
as	1
in	1
that	1
triumphal	1
hall	1
at	1
Versailles;	1
where	1
the	1
beholder	1
fights	1
his	1
way,	1
pell-mell,	1
through	1
the	1
consecutive	1
great	1
battles	1
of	1
France;	1
where	1
every	1
sword	1
seems	1
a	1
flash	1
of	1
the	1
Northern	1
Lights,	1
and	1
the	1
successive	1
armed	1
kings	1
and	1
Emperors	1
dash	1
by,	1
like	1
a	1
charge	1
of	1
crowned	1
centaurs?	1
Not	1
wholly	1
unworthy	1
of	1
a	1
place	1
in	1
that	1
gallery,	1
are	1
these	1
sea	1
battle-pieces	1
of	1
Garnery.	1
The	1
natural	1
aptitude	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
for	1
seizing	1
the	1
picturesqueness	1
of	1
things	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
peculiarly	1
evinced	1
in	1
what	1
paintings	1
and	1
engravings	1
they	1
have	1
of	1
their	1
whaling	1
scenes.	1
With	1
not	1
one	1
tenth	1
of	1
England's	1
experience	1
in	1
the	1
fishery,	1
and	1
not	1
the	1
thousandth	1
part	1
of	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
Americans,	1
they	1
have	1
nevertheless	1
furnished	1
both	1
nations	1
with	1
the	1
only	1
finished	1
sketches	1
at	1
all	1
capable	1
of	1
conveying	1
the	1
real	1
spirit	1
of	1
the	1
whale	1
hunt.	1
For	1
the	1
most	1
part,	1
the	1
English	1
and	1
American	1
whale	1
draughtsmen	1
seem	1
entirely	1
content	1
with	1
presenting	1
the	1
mechanical	1
outline	1
of	1
things,	1
such	1
as	1
the	1
vacant	1
profile	1
of	1
the	1
whale;	1
which,	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
picturesqueness	1
of	1
effect	1
is	1
concerned,	1
is	1
about	1
tantamount	1
to	1
sketching	1
the	1
profile	1
of	1
a	1
pyramid.	1
Even	1
Scoresby,	1
the	1
justly	1
renowned	1
Right	1
whaleman,	1
after	1
giving	1
us	1
a	1
stiff	1
full	1
length	1
of	1
the	1
Greenland	1
whale,	1
and	1
three	1
or	1
four	1
delicate	1
miniatures	1
of	1
narwhales	1
and	1
porpoises,	1
treats	1
us	1
to	1
a	1
series	1
of	1
classical	1
engravings	1
of	1
boat	1
hooks,	1
chopping	1
knives,	1
and	1
grapnels;	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
microscopic	1
diligence	1
of	1
a	1
Leuwenhoeck	1
submits	1
to	1
the	1
inspection	1
of	1
a	1
shivering	1
world	1
ninety-six	1
fac-similes	1
of	1
magnified	1
Arctic	1
snow	1
crystals.	1
I	1
mean	1
no	1
disparagement	1
to	1
the	1
excellent	1
voyager	1
(I	1
honour	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
veteran),	1
but	1
in	1
so	1
important	1
a	1
matter	1
it	1
was	1
certainly	1
an	1
oversight	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
procured	1
for	1
every	1
crystal	1
a	1
sworn	1
affidavit	1
taken	1
before	1
a	1
Greenland	1
Justice	1
of	1
the	1
Peace.	1
In	1
addition	1
to	1
those	1
fine	1
engravings	1
from	1
Garnery,	1
there	1
are	1
two	1
other	1
French	1
engravings	1
worthy	1
of	1
note,	1
by	1
some	1
one	1
who	1
subscribes	1
himself	1
"H.	1
Durand."	1
One	1
of	1
them,	1
though	1
not	1
precisely	1
adapted	1
to	1
our	1
present	1
purpose,	1
nevertheless	1
deserves	1
mention	1
on	1
other	1
accounts.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
quiet	1
noon-scene	1
among	1
the	1
isles	1
of	1
the	1
Pacific;	1
a	1
French	1
whaler	1
anchored,	1
inshore,	1
in	1
a	1
calm,	1
and	1
lazily	1
taking	1
water	1
on	1
board;	1
the	1
loosened	1
sails	1
of	1
the	1
ship,	1
and	1
the	1
long	1
leaves	1
of	1
the	1
palms	1
in	1
the	1
background,	1
both	1
drooping	1
together	1
in	1
the	1
breezeless	1
air.	1
The	1
effect	1
is	1
very	1
fine,	1
when	1
considered	1
with	1
reference	1
to	1
its	1
presenting	1
the	1
hardy	1
fishermen	1
under	1
one	1
of	1
their	1
few	1
aspects	1
of	1
oriental	1
repose.	1
The	1
other	1
engraving	1
is	1
quite	1
a	1
different	1
affair:	1
the	1
ship	1
hove-to	1
upon	1
the	1
open	1
sea,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
heart	1
of	1
the	1
Leviathanic	1
life,	1
with	1
a	1
Right	1
Whale	1
alongside;	1
the	1
vessel	1
(in	1
the	1
act	1
of	1
cutting-in)	1
hove	1
over	1
to	1
the	1
monster	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
a	1
quay;	1
and	1
a	1
boat,	1
hurriedly	1
pushing	1
off	1
from	1
this	1
scene	1
of	1
activity,	1
is	1
about	1
giving	1
chase	1
to	1
whales	1
in	1
the	1
distance.	1
The	1
harpoons	1
and	1
lances	1
lie	1
levelled	1
for	1
use;	1
three	1
oarsmen	1
are	1
just	1
setting	1
the	1
mast	1
in	1
its	1
hole;	1
while	1
from	1
a	1
sudden	1
roll	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
the	1
little	1
craft	1
stands	1
half-erect	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
water,	1
like	1
a	1
rearing	1
horse.	1
From	1
the	1
ship,	1
the	1
smoke	1
of	1
the	1
torments	1
of	1
the	1
boiling	1
whale	1
is	1
going	1
up	1
like	1
the	1
smoke	1
over	1
a	1
village	1
of	1
smithies;	1
and	1
to	1
windward,	1
a	1
black	1
cloud,	1
rising	1
up	1
with	1
earnest	1
of	1
squalls	1
and	1
rains,	1
seems	1
to	1
quicken	1
the	1
activity	1
of	1
the	1
excited	1
seamen.	1

Stars.	1
On	1
Tower-hill,	1
as	1
you	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
London	1
docks,	1
you	1
may	1
have	1
seen	1
a	1
crippled	1
beggar	1
(or	1
KEDGER,	1
as	1
the	1
sailors	1
say)	1
holding	1
a	1
painted	1
board	1
before	1
him,	1
representing	1
the	1
tragic	1
scene	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
lost	1
his	1
leg.	1
There	1
are	1
three	1
whales	1
and	1
three	1
boats;	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
boats	1
(presumed	1
to	1
contain	1
the	1
missing	1
leg	1
in	1
all	1
its	1
original	1
integrity)	1
is	1
being	1
crunched	1
by	1
the	1
jaws	1
of	1
the	1
foremost	1
whale.	1
Any	1
time	1
these	1
ten	1
years,	1
they	1
tell	1
me,	1
has	1
that	1
man	1
held	1
up	1
that	1
picture,	1
and	1
exhibited	1
that	1
stump	1
to	1
an	1
incredulous	1
world.	1
But	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
his	1
justification	1
has	1
now	1
come.	1
His	1
three	1
whales	1
are	1
as	1
good	1
whales	1
as	1
were	1
ever	1
published	1
in	1
Wapping,	1
at	1
any	1
rate;	1
and	1
his	1
stump	1
as	1
unquestionable	1
a	1
stump	1
as	1
any	1
you	1
will	1
find	1
in	1
the	1
western	1
clearings.	1
But,	1
though	1
for	1
ever	1
mounted	1
on	1
that	1
stump,	1
never	1
a	1
stump-speech	1
does	1
the	1
poor	1
whaleman	1
make;	1
but,	1
with	1
downcast	1
eyes,	1
stands	1
ruefully	1
contemplating	1
his	1
own	1
amputation.	1
Throughout	1
the	1
Pacific,	1
and	1
also	1
in	1
Nantucket,	1
and	1
New	1
Bedford,	1
and	1
Sag	1
Harbor,	1
you	1
will	1
come	1
across	1
lively	1
sketches	1
of	1
whales	1
and	1
whaling-scenes,	1
graven	1
by	1
the	1
fishermen	1
themselves	1
on	1
Sperm	1
Whale-teeth,	1
or	1
ladies'	1
busks	1
wrought	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
Right	1
Whale-bone,	1
and	1
other	1
like	1
skrimshander	1
articles,	1
as	1
the	1
whalemen	1
call	1
the	1
numerous	1
little	1
ingenious	1
contrivances	1
they	1
elaborately	1
carve	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
rough	1
material,	1
in	1
their	1
hours	1
of	1
ocean	1
leisure.	1
Some	1
of	1
them	1
have	1
little	1
boxes	1
of	1
dentistical-looking	1
implements,	1
specially	1
intended	1
for	1
the	1
skrimshandering	1
business.	1
But,	1
in	1
general,	1
they	1
toil	1
with	1
their	1
jack-knives	1
alone;	1
and,	1
with	1
that	1
almost	1
omnipotent	1
tool	1
of	1
the	1
sailor,	1
they	1
will	1
turn	1
you	1
out	1
anything	1
you	1
please,	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
a	1
mariner's	1
fancy.	1
Long	1
exile	1
from	1
Christendom	1
and	1
civilization	1
inevitably	1
restores	1
a	1
man	1
to	1
that	1
condition	1
in	1
which	1
God	1
placed	1
him,	1
i.e.	1
what	1
is	1
called	1
savagery.	1
Your	1
true	1
whale-hunter	1
is	1
as	1
much	1
a	1
savage	1
as	1
an	1
Iroquois.	1
I	1
myself	1
am	1
a	1
savage,	1
owning	1
no	1
allegiance	1
but	1
to	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
the	1
Cannibals;	1
and	1
ready	1
at	1
any	1
moment	1
to	1
rebel	1
against	1
him.	1
Now,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
peculiar	1
characteristics	1
of	1
the	1
savage	1
in	1
his	1
domestic	1
hours,	1
is	1
his	1
wonderful	1
patience	1
of	1
industry.	1
An	1
ancient	1
Hawaiian	1
war-club	1
or	1
spear-paddle,	1
in	1
its	1
full	1
multiplicity	1
and	1
elaboration	1
of	1
carving,	1
is	1
as	1
great	1
a	1
trophy	1
of	1
human	1
perseverance	1
as	1
a	1
Latin	1
lexicon.	1
For,	1
with	1
but	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
broken	1
sea-shell	1
or	1
a	1
shark's	1
tooth,	1
that	1
miraculous	1
intricacy	1
of	1
wooden	1
net-work	1
has	1
been	1
achieved;	1
and	1
it	1
has	1
cost	1
steady	1
years	1
of	1
steady	1
application.	1
As	1
with	1
the	1
Hawaiian	1
savage,	1
so	1
with	1
the	1
white	1
sailor-savage.	1
With	1
the	1
same	1
marvellous	1
patience,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
single	1
shark's	1
tooth,	1
of	1
his	1
one	1
poor	1
jack-knife,	1
he	1
will	1
carve	1
you	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
bone	1
sculpture,	1
not	1
quite	1
as	1
workmanlike,	1
but	1
as	1
close	1
packed	1
in	1
its	1
maziness	1
of	1
design,	1
as	1
the	1
Greek	1
savage,	1
Achilles's	1
shield;	1
and	1
full	1
of	1
barbaric	1
spirit	1
and	1
suggestiveness,	1
as	1
the	1
prints	1
of	1
that	1
fine	1
old	1
Dutch	1
savage,	1
Albert	1
Durer.	1
Wooden	1
whales,	1
or	1
whales	1
cut	1
in	1
profile	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
small	1
dark	1
slabs	1
of	1
the	1
noble	1
South	1
Sea	1
war-wood,	1
are	1
frequently	1
met	1
with	1
in	1
the	1
forecastles	1
of	1
American	1
whalers.	1
Some	1
of	1
them	1
are	1
done	1
with	1
much	1
accuracy.	1
At	1
some	1
old	1
gable-roofed	1
country	1
houses	1
you	1
will	1
see	1
brass	1
whales	1
hung	1
by	1
the	1
tail	1
for	1
knockers	1
to	1
the	1
road-side	1
door.	1
When	1
the	1
porter	1
is	1
sleepy,	1
the	1
anvil-headed	1
whale	1
would	1
be	1
best.	1
But	1
these	1
knocking	1
whales	1
are	1
seldom	1
remarkable	1
as	1
faithful	1
essays.	1
On	1
the	1
spires	1
of	1
some	1
old-fashioned	1
churches	1
you	1
will	1
see	1
sheet-iron	1
whales	1
placed	1
there	1
for	1
weather-cocks;	1
but	1
they	1
are	1
so	1
elevated,	1
and	1
besides	1
that	1
are	1
to	1
all	1
intents	1
and	1
purposes	1
so	1
labelled	1
with	1
"HANDS	1
OFF!"	1
you	1
cannot	1
examine	1
them	1
closely	1
enough	1
to	1
decide	1
upon	1
their	1
merit.	1
In	1
bony,	1
ribby	1
regions	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
where	1
at	1
the	1
base	1
of	1
high	1
broken	1
cliffs	1
masses	1
of	1
rock	1
lie	1
strewn	1
in	1
fantastic	1
groupings	1
upon	1
the	1
plain,	1
you	1
will	1
often	1
discover	1
images	1
as	1
of	1
the	1
petrified	1
forms	1
of	1
the	1
Leviathan	1
partly	1
merged	1
in	1
grass,	1
which	1
of	1
a	1
windy	1
day	1
breaks	1
against	1
them	1
in	1
a	1
surf	1
of	1
green	1
surges.	1
Then,	1
again,	1
in	1
mountainous	1
countries	1
where	1
the	1
traveller	1
is	1
continually	1
girdled	1
by	1
amphitheatrical	1
heights;	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
from	1
some	1
lucky	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
you	1
will	1
catch	1
passing	1
glimpses	1
of	1
the	1
profiles	1
of	1
whales	1
defined	1
along	1
the	1
undulating	1
ridges.	1
But	1
you	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
thorough	1
whaleman,	1
to	1
see	1
these	1
sights;	1
and	1
not	1
only	1
that,	1
but	1
if	1
you	1
wish	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
sight	1
again,	1
you	1
must	1
be	1
sure	1
and	1
take	1
the	1
exact	1
intersecting	1
latitude	1
and	1
longitude	1
of	1
your	1
first	1
stand-point,	1
else	1
so	1
chance-like	1
are	1
such	1
observations	1
of	1
the	1
hills,	1
that	1
your	1
precise,	1
previous	1
stand-point	1
would	1
require	1
a	1
laborious	1
re-discovery;	1
like	1
the	1
Soloma	1
Islands,	1
which	1
still	1
remain	1
incognita,	1
though	1
once	1
high-ruffed	1
Mendanna	1
trod	1
them	1
and	1
old	1
Figuera	1
chronicled	1
them.	1
Nor	1
when	1
expandingly	1
lifted	1
by	1
your	1
subject,	1
can	1
you	1
fail	1
to	1
trace	1
out	1
great	1
whales	1
in	1
the	1
starry	1
heavens,	1
and	1
boats	1
in	1
pursuit	1
of	1
them;	1
as	1
when	1
long	1
filled	1
with	1
thoughts	1
of	1
war	1
the	1
Eastern	1
nations	1
saw	1
armies	1
locked	1
in	1
battle	1
among	1
the	1
clouds.	1
Thus	1
at	1
the	1
North	1
have	1
I	1
chased	1
Leviathan	1
round	1
and	1
round	1
the	1
Pole	1
with	1
the	1
revolutions	1
of	1
the	1
bright	1
points	1
that	1
first	1
defined	1
him	1
to	1
me.	1
And	1
beneath	1
the	1
effulgent	1
Antarctic	1
skies	1
I	1
have	1
boarded	1
the	1
Argo-Navis,	1
and	1
joined	1
the	1
chase	1
against	1
the	1
starry	1
Cetus	1
far	1
beyond	1
the	1
utmost	1
stretch	1
of	1
Hydrus	1
and	1
the	1
Flying	1
Fish.	1
With	1
a	1
frigate's	1
anchors	1
for	1
my	1
bridle-bitts	1
and	1
fasces	1
of	1
harpoons	1
for	1
spurs,	1
would	1
I	1
could	1
mount	1
that	1
whale	1
and	1
leap	1
the	1
topmost	1
skies,	1
to	1
see	1
whether	1
the	1
fabled	1
heavens	1
with	1
all	1
their	1
countless	1
tents	1
really	1
lie	1
encamped	1
beyond	1
my	1
mortal	1
sight!	1
CHAPTER	1
58	1
Brit.	1
Steering	1
north-eastward	1
from	1
the	1
Crozetts,	1
we	1
fell	1
in	1
with	1
vast	1
meadows	1
of	1
brit,	1
the	1
minute,	1
yellow	1
substance,	1
upon	1
which	1
the	1
Right	1
Whale	1
largely	1
feeds.	1
For	1
leagues	1
and	1
leagues	1
it	1
undulated	1
round	1
us,	1
so	1
that	1
we	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
sailing	1
through	1
boundless	1
fields	1
of	1
ripe	1
and	1
golden	1
wheat.	1
On	1
the	1
second	1
day,	1
numbers	1
of	1
Right	1
Whales	1
were	1
seen,	1
who,	1
secure	1
from	1
the	1
attack	1
of	1
a	1
Sperm	1
Whaler	1
like	1
the	1
Pequod,	1
with	1
open	1
jaws	1
sluggishly	1
swam	1
through	1
the	1
brit,	1
which,	1
adhering	1
to	1
the	1
fringing	1
fibres	1
of	1
that	1
wondrous	1
Venetian	1
blind	1
in	1
their	1
mouths,	1
was	1
in	1
that	1
manner	1
separated	1
from	1
the	1
water	1
that	1
escaped	1
at	1
the	1
lip.	1
As	1
morning	1
mowers,	1
who	1
side	1
by	1
side	1
slowly	1
and	1
seethingly	1
advance	1
their	1
scythes	1
through	1
the	1
long	1
wet	1
grass	1
of	1
marshy	1
meads;	1
even	1
so	1
these	1
monsters	1
swam,	1
making	1
a	1
strange,	1
grassy,	1
cutting	1
sound;	1
and	1
leaving	1
behind	1
them	1
endless	1
swaths	1
of	1
blue	1
upon	1
the	1
yellow	1
sea.*	1
*That	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
known	1
among	1
whalemen	1
as	1
the	1
"Brazil	1
Banks"	1
does	1
not	1
bear	1
that	1
name	1
as	1
the	1
Banks	1
of	1
Newfoundland	1
do,	1
because	1
of	1
there	1
being	1
shallows	1
and	1
soundings	1
there,	1
but	1
because	1
of	1
this	1
remarkable	1
meadow-like	1
appearance,	1
caused	1
by	1
the	1
vast	1
drifts	1
of	1
brit	1
continually	1
floating	1
in	1
those	1
latitudes,	1
where	1
the	1
Right	1
Whale	1
is	1
often	1
chased.	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
the	1
sound	1
they	1
made	1
as	1
they	1
parted	1
the	1
brit	1
which	1
at	1
all	1
reminded	1
one	1
of	1
mowers.	1
Seen	1
from	1
the	1
mast-heads,	1
especially	1
when	1
they	1
paused	1
and	1
were	1
stationary	1
for	1
a	1
while,	1
their	1
vast	1
black	1
forms	1
looked	1
more	1
like	1
lifeless	1
masses	1
of	1
rock	1
than	1
anything	1
else.	1
And	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
great	1
hunting	1
countries	1
of	1
India,	1
the	1
stranger	1
at	1
a	1
distance	1
will	1
sometimes	1
pass	1
on	1
the	1
plains	1
recumbent	1
elephants	1
without	1
knowing	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
such,	1
taking	1
them	1
for	1
bare,	1
blackened	1
elevations	1
of	1
the	1
soil;	1
even	1
so,	1
often,	1
with	1
him,	1
who	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
beholds	1
this	1
species	1
of	1
the	1
leviathans	1
of	1
the	1
sea.	1
And	1
even	1
when	1
recognised	1
at	1
last,	1
their	1
immense	1
magnitude	1
renders	1
it	1
very	1
hard	1
really	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
such	1
bulky	1
masses	1
of	1
overgrowth	1
can	1
possibly	1
be	1
instinct,	1
in	1
all	1
parts,	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
sort	1
of	1
life	1
that	1
lives	1
in	1
a	1
dog	1
or	1
a	1
horse.	1
Indeed,	1
in	1
other	1
respects,	1
you	1
can	1
hardly	1
regard	1
any	1
creatures	1
of	1
the	1
deep	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
feelings	1
that	1
you	1
do	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
shore.	1
For	1
though	1
some	1
old	1
naturalists	1
have	1
maintained	1
that	1
all	1
creatures	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
are	1
of	1
their	1
kind	1
in	1
the	1
sea;	1
and	1
though	1
taking	1
a	1
broad	1
general	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
thing,	1
this	1
may	1
very	1
well	1
be;	1
yet	1
coming	1
to	1
specialties,	1
where,	1
for	1
example,	1
does	1
the	1
ocean	1
furnish	1
any	1
fish	1
that	1
in	1
disposition	1
answers	1
to	1
the	1
sagacious	1
kindness	1
of	1
the	1
dog?	1
The	1
accursed	1
shark	1
alone	1
can	1
in	1
any	1
generic	1
respect	1
be	1
said	1
to	1
bear	1
comparative	1
analogy	1
to	1
him.	1
But	1
though,	1
to	1
landsmen	1
in	1
general,	1
the	1
native	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
seas	1
have	1
ever	1
been	1
regarded	1
with	1
emotions	1
unspeakably	1
unsocial	1
and	1
repelling;	1
though	1
we	1
know	1
the	1
sea	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
everlasting	1
terra	1
incognita,	1
so	1
that	1
Columbus	1
sailed	1
over	1
numberless	1
unknown	1
worlds	1
to	1
discover	1
his	1
one	1
superficial	1
western	1
one;	1
though,	1
by	1
vast	1
odds,	1
the	1
most	1
terrific	1
of	1
all	1
mortal	1
disasters	1
have	1
immemorially	1
and	1
indiscriminately	1
befallen	1
tens	1
and	1
hundreds	1
of	1
thousands	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
have	1
gone	1
upon	1
the	1
waters;	1
though	1
but	1
a	1
moment's	1
consideration	1
will	1
teach,	1
that	1
however	1
baby	1
man	1
may	1
brag	1
of	1
his	1
science	1
and	1
skill,	1
and	1
however	1
much,	1
in	1
a	1
flattering	1
future,	1
that	1
science	1
and	1
skill	1
may	1
augment;	1
yet	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
for	1
ever,	1
to	1
the	1
crack	1
of	1
doom,	1
the	1
sea	1
will	1
insult	1
and	1
murder	1
him,	1
and	1
pulverize	1
the	1
stateliest,	1
stiffest	1
frigate	1
he	1
can	1
make;	1
nevertheless,	1
by	1
the	1
continual	1
repetition	1
of	1
these	1
very	1
impressions,	1
man	1
has	1
lost	1
that	1
sense	1
of	1
the	1
full	1
awfulness	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
which	1
aboriginally	1
belongs	1
to	1
it.	1
The	1
first	1
boat	1
we	1
read	1
of,	1
floated	1
on	1
an	1
ocean,	1
that	1
with	1
Portuguese	1
vengeance	1
had	1
whelmed	1
a	1
whole	1
world	1
without	1
leaving	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
a	1
widow.	1
That	1
same	1
ocean	1
rolls	1
now;	1
that	1
same	1
ocean	1
destroyed	1
the	1
wrecked	1
ships	1
of	1
last	1
year.	1
Yea,	1
foolish	1
mortals,	1
Noah's	1
flood	1
is	1
not	1
yet	1
subsided;	1
two	1
thirds	1
of	1
the	1
fair	1
world	1
it	1
yet	1
covers.	1
Wherein	1
differ	1
the	1
sea	1
and	1
the	1
land,	1
that	1
a	1
miracle	1
upon	1
one	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
miracle	1
upon	1
the	1
other?	1
Preternatural	1
terrors	1
rested	1
upon	1
the	1
Hebrews,	1
when	1
under	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
Korah	1
and	1
his	1
company	1
the	1
live	1
ground	1
opened	1
and	1
swallowed	1
them	1
up	1
for	1
ever;	1
yet	1
not	1
a	1
modern	1
sun	1
ever	1
sets,	1
but	1
in	1
precisely	1
the	1
same	1
manner	1
the	1
live	1
sea	1
swallows	1
up	1
ships	1
and	1
crews.	1
But	1
not	1
only	1
is	1
the	1
sea	1
such	1
a	1
foe	1
to	1
man	1
who	1
is	1
an	1
alien	1
to	1
it,	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
also	1
a	1
fiend	1
to	1
its	1
own	1
off-spring;	1
worse	1
than	1
the	1
Persian	1
host	1
who	1
murdered	1
his	1
own	1
guests;	1
sparing	1
not	1
the	1
creatures	1
which	1
itself	1
hath	1
spawned.	1
Like	1
a	1
savage	1
tigress	1
that	1
tossing	1
in	1
the	1
jungle	1
overlays	1
her	1
own	1
cubs,	1
so	1
the	1
sea	1
dashes	1
even	1
the	1
mightiest	1
whales	1
against	1
the	1
rocks,	1
and	1
leaves	1
them	1
there	1
side	1
by	1
side	1
with	1
the	1
split	1
wrecks	1
of	1
ships.	1
No	1
mercy,	1
no	1
power	1
but	1
its	1
own	1
controls	1
it.	1
Panting	1
and	1
snorting	1
like	1
a	1
mad	1
battle	1
steed	1
that	1
has	1
lost	1
its	1
rider,	1
the	1
masterless	1
ocean	1
overruns	1
the	1
globe.	1
Consider	1
the	1
subtleness	1
of	1
the	1
sea;	1
how	1
its	1
most	1
dreaded	1
creatures	1
glide	1
under	1
water,	1
unapparent	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
part,	1
and	1
treacherously	1
hidden	1
beneath	1
the	1
loveliest	1
tints	1
of	1
azure.	1
Consider	1
also	1
the	1
devilish	1
brilliance	1
and	1
beauty	1
of	1
many	1
of	1
its	1
most	1
remorseless	1
tribes,	1
as	1
the	1
dainty	1
embellished	1
shape	1
of	1
many	1
species	1
of	1
sharks.	1
Consider,	1
once	1
more,	1
the	1
universal	1
cannibalism	1
of	1
the	1
sea;	1
all	1
whose	1
creatures	1
prey	1
upon	1
each	1
other,	1
carrying	1
on	1
eternal	1
war	1
since	1
the	1
world	1
began.	1
Consider	1
all	1
this;	1
and	1
then	1
turn	1
to	1
this	1
green,	1
gentle,	1
and	1
most	1
docile	1
earth;	1
consider	1
them	1
both,	1
the	1
sea	1
and	1
the	1
land;	1
and	1
do	1
you	1
not	1
find	1
a	1
strange	1
analogy	1
to	1
something	1
in	1
yourself?	1
For	1
as	1
this	1
appalling	1
ocean	1
surrounds	1
the	1
verdant	1
land,	1
so	1
in	1
the	1
soul	1
of	1
man	1
there	1
lies	1
one	1
insular	1
Tahiti,	1
full	1
of	1
peace	1
and	1
joy,	1
but	1
encompassed	1
by	1
all	1
the	1
horrors	1
of	1
the	1
half	1
known	1
life.	1
God	1
keep	1
thee!	1
Push	1
not	1
off	1
from	1
that	1
isle,	1
thou	1
canst	1
never	1
return!	1
CHAPTER	1
59	1
Squid.	1
Slowly	1
wading	1
through	1
the	1
meadows	1
of	1
brit,	1
the	1
Pequod	1
still	1
held	1
on	1
her	1
way	1
north-eastward	1
towards	1
the	1
island	1
of	1
Java;	1
a	1
gentle	1
air	1
impelling	1
her	1
keel,	1
so	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
surrounding	1
serenity	1
her	1
three	1
tall	1
tapering	1
masts	1
mildly	1
waved	1
to	1
that	1
languid	1
breeze,	1
as	1
three	1
mild	1
palms	1
on	1
a	1
plain.	1
And	1
still,	1
at	1
wide	1
intervals	1
in	1
the	1
silvery	1
night,	1
the	1
lonely,	1
alluring	1
jet	1
would	1
be	1
seen.	1
But	1
one	1
transparent	1
blue	1
morning,	1
when	1
a	1
stillness	1
almost	1
preternatural	1
spread	1
over	1
the	1
sea,	1
however	1
unattended	1
with	1
any	1
stagnant	1
calm;	1
when	1
the	1
long	1
burnished	1
sun-glade	1
on	1
the	1
waters	1
seemed	1
a	1
golden	1
finger	1
laid	1
across	1
them,	1
enjoining	1
some	1
secrecy;	1
when	1
the	1
slippered	1
waves	1
whispered	1
together	1
as	1
they	1
softly	1
ran	1
on;	1
in	1
this	1
profound	1
hush	1
of	1
the	1
visible	1
sphere	1
a	1
strange	1
spectre	1
was	1
seen	1
by	1
Daggoo	1
from	1
the	1
main-mast-head.	1
In	1
the	1
distance,	1
a	1
great	1
white	1
mass	1
lazily	1
rose,	1
and	1
rising	1
higher	1
and	1
higher,	1
and	1
disentangling	1
itself	1
from	1
the	1
azure,	1
at	1
last	1
gleamed	1
before	1
our	1
prow	1
like	1
a	1
snow-slide,	1
new	1
slid	1
from	1
the	1
hills.	1
Thus	1
glistening	1
for	1
a	1
moment,	1
as	1
slowly	1
it	1
subsided,	1
and	1
sank.	1
Then	1
once	1
more	1
arose,	1
and	1
silently	1
gleamed.	1
It	1
seemed	1
not	1
a	1
whale;	1
and	1
yet	1
is	1
this	1
Moby	1
Dick?	1
thought	1
Daggoo.	1
Again	1
the	1
phantom	1
went	1
down,	1
but	1
on	1
re-appearing	1
once	1
more,	1
with	1
a	1
stiletto-like	1
cry	1
that	1
startled	1
every	1
man	1
from	1
his	1
nod,	1
the	1
negro	1
yelled	1
out--"There!	1
there	1
again!	1
there	1
she	1
breaches!	1
right	1
ahead!	1
The	1
White	1
Whale,	1
the	1
White	1
Whale!"	1
Upon	1
this,	1
the	1
seamen	1
rushed	1
to	1
the	1
yard-arms,	1
as	1
in	1
swarming-time	1
the	1
bees	1
rush	1
to	1
the	1
boughs.	1
Bare-headed	1
in	1
the	1
sultry	1
sun,	1
Ahab	1
stood	1
on	1
the	1
bowsprit,	1
and	1
with	1
one	1
hand	1
pushed	1
far	1
behind	1
in	1
readiness	1
to	1
wave	1
his	1
orders	1
to	1
the	1
helmsman,	1
cast	1
his	1
eager	1
glance	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
indicated	1
aloft	1
by	1
the	1
outstretched	1
motionless	1
arm	1
of	1
Daggoo.	1
Whether	1
the	1
flitting	1
attendance	1
of	1
the	1
one	1
still	1
and	1
solitary	1
jet	1
had	1
gradually	1
worked	1
upon	1
Ahab,	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
now	1
prepared	1
to	1
connect	1
the	1
ideas	1
of	1
mildness	1
and	1
repose	1
with	1
the	1
first	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
particular	1
whale	1
he	1
pursued;	1
however	1
this	1
was,	1
or	1
whether	1
his	1
eagerness	1
betrayed	1
him;	1
whichever	1
way	1
it	1
might	1
have	1
been,	1
no	1
sooner	1
did	1
he	1
distinctly	1
perceive	1
the	1
white	1
mass,	1
than	1
with	1
a	1
quick	1
intensity	1
he	1
instantly	1
gave	1
orders	1
for	1
lowering.	1
The	1
four	1
boats	1
were	1
soon	1
on	1
the	1
water;	1
Ahab's	1
in	1
advance,	1
and	1
all	1
swiftly	1
pulling	1
towards	1
their	1
prey.	1
Soon	1
it	1
went	1
down,	1
and	1
while,	1
with	1
oars	1
suspended,	1
we	1
were	1
awaiting	1
its	1
reappearance,	1
lo!	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
spot	1
where	1
it	1
sank,	1
once	1
more	1
it	1
slowly	1
rose.	1
Almost	1
forgetting	1
for	1
the	1
moment	1
all	1
thoughts	1
of	1
Moby	1
Dick,	1
we	1
now	1
gazed	1
at	1
the	1
most	1
wondrous	1
phenomenon	1
which	1
the	1
secret	1
seas	1
have	1
hitherto	1
revealed	1
to	1
mankind.	1
A	1
vast	1
pulpy	1
mass,	1
furlongs	1
in	1
length	1
and	1
breadth,	1
of	1
a	1
glancing	1
cream-colour,	1
lay	1
floating	1
on	1
the	1
water,	1
innumerable	1
long	1
arms	1
radiating	1
from	1
its	1
centre,	1
and	1
curling	1
and	1
twisting	1
like	1
a	1
nest	1
of	1
anacondas,	1
as	1
if	1
blindly	1
to	1
clutch	1
at	1
any	1
hapless	1
object	1
within	1
reach.	1
No	1
perceptible	1
face	1
or	1
front	1
did	1
it	1
have;	1
no	1
conceivable	1
token	1
of	1
either	1
sensation	1
or	1
instinct;	1
but	1
undulated	1
there	1
on	1
the	1
billows,	1
an	1
unearthly,	1
formless,	1
chance-like	1
apparition	1
of	1
life.	1
As	1
with	1
a	1
low	1
sucking	1
sound	1
it	1
slowly	1
disappeared	1
again,	1
Starbuck	1
still	1
gazing	1
at	1
the	1
agitated	1
waters	1
where	1
it	1
had	1
sunk,	1
with	1
a	1
wild	1
voice	1
exclaimed--"Almost	1
rather	1
had	1
I	1
seen	1
Moby	1
Dick	1
and	1
fought	1
him,	1
than	1
to	1
have	1
seen	1
thee,	1
thou	1
white	1
ghost!"	1
"What	1
was	1
it,	1
Sir?"	1
said	1
Flask.	1
"The	1
great	1
live	1
squid,	1
which,	1
they	1
say,	1
few	1
whale-ships	1
ever	1
beheld,	1
and	1
returned	1
to	1
their	1
ports	1
to	1
tell	1
of	1
it."	1
But	1
Ahab	1
said	1
nothing;	1
turning	1
his	1
boat,	1
he	1
sailed	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
vessel;	1
the	1
rest	1
as	1
silently	1
following.	1
Whatever	1
superstitions	1
the	1
sperm	1
whalemen	1
in	1
general	1
have	1
connected	1
with	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
this	1
object,	1
certain	1
it	1
is,	1
that	1
a	1
glimpse	1
of	1
it	1
being	1
so	1
very	1
unusual,	1
that	1
circumstance	1
has	1
gone	1
far	1
to	1
invest	1
it	1
with	1
portentousness.	1
So	1
rarely	1
is	1
it	1
beheld,	1
that	1
though	1
one	1
and	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
declare	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
largest	1
animated	1
thing	1
in	1
the	1
ocean,	1
yet	1
very	1
few	1
of	1
them	1
have	1
any	1
but	1
the	1
most	1
vague	1
ideas	1
concerning	1
its	1
true	1
nature	1
and	1
form;	1
notwithstanding,	1
they	1
believe	1
it	1
to	1
furnish	1
to	1
the	1
sperm	1
whale	1
his	1
only	1
food.	1
For	1
though	1
other	1
species	1
of	1
whales	1
find	1
their	1
food	1
above	1
water,	1
and	1
may	1
be	1
seen	1
by	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
act	1
of	1
feeding,	1
the	1
spermaceti	1
whale	1
obtains	1
his	1
whole	1
food	1
in	1
unknown	1
zones	1
below	1
the	1
surface;	1
and	1
only	1
by	1
inference	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
any	1
one	1
can	1
tell	1
of	1
what,	1
precisely,	1
that	1
food	1
consists.	1
At	1
times,	1
when	1
closely	1
pursued,	1
he	1
will	1
disgorge	1
what	1
are	1
supposed	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
detached	1
arms	1
of	1
the	1
squid;	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
thus	1
exhibited	1
exceeding	1
twenty	1
and	1
thirty	1
feet	1
in	1
length.	1
They	1
fancy	1
that	1
the	1
monster	1
to	1
which	1
these	1
arms	1
belonged	1
ordinarily	1
clings	1
by	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
bed	1
of	1
the	1
ocean;	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
sperm	1
whale,	1
unlike	1
other	1
species,	1
is	1
supplied	1
with	1
teeth	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
attack	1
and	1
tear	1
it.	1
There	1
seems	1
some	1
ground	1
to	1
imagine	1
that	1
the	1
great	1
Kraken	1
of	1
Bishop	1
Pontoppodan	1
may	1
ultimately	1
resolve	1
itself	1
into	1
Squid.	1
The	1
manner	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
Bishop	1
describes	1
it,	1
as	1
alternately	1
rising	1
and	1
sinking,	1
with	1
some	1
other	1
particulars	1
he	1
narrates,	1
in	1
all	1
this	1
the	1
two	1
correspond.	1
But	1
much	1
abatement	1
is	1
necessary	1
with	1
respect	1
to	1
the	1
incredible	1
bulk	1
he	1
assigns	1
it.	1
By	1
some	1
naturalists	1
who	1
have	1
vaguely	1
heard	1
rumors	1
of	1
the	1
mysterious	1
creature,	1
here	1
spoken	1
of,	1
it	1
is	1
included	1
among	1
the	1
class	1
of	1
cuttle-fish,	1
to	1
which,	1
indeed,	1
in	1
certain	1
external	1
respects	1
it	1
would	1
seem	1
to	1
belong,	1
but	1
only	1
as	1
the	1
Anak	1
of	1
the	1
tribe.	1
CHAPTER	1
60	1
The	1
Line.	1
With	1
reference	1
to	1
the	1
whaling	1
scene	1
shortly	1
to	1
be	1
described,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
for	1
the	1
better	1
understanding	1
of	1
all	1
similar	1
scenes	1
elsewhere	1
presented,	1
I	1
have	1
here	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
the	1
magical,	1
sometimes	1
horrible	1
whale-line.	1
The	1
line	1
originally	1
used	1
in	1
the	1
fishery	1
was	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
hemp,	1
slightly	1
vapoured	1
with	1
tar,	1
not	1
impregnated	1
with	1
it,	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
ordinary	1
ropes;	1
for	1
while	1
tar,	1
as	1
ordinarily	1
used,	1
makes	1
the	1
hemp	1
more	1
pliable	1
to	1
the	1
rope-maker,	1
and	1
also	1
renders	1
the	1
rope	1
itself	1
more	1
convenient	1
to	1
the	1
sailor	1
for	1
common	1
ship	1
use;	1
yet,	1
not	1
only	1
would	1
the	1
ordinary	1
quantity	1
too	1
much	1
stiffen	1
the	1
whale-line	1
for	1
the	1
close	1
coiling	1
to	1
which	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
subjected;	1
but	1
as	1
most	1
seamen	1
are	1
beginning	1
to	1
learn,	1
tar	1
in	1
general	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
adds	1
to	1
the	1
rope's	1
durability	1
or	1
strength,	1
however	1
much	1
it	1
may	1
give	1
it	1
compactness	1
and	1
gloss.	1
Of	1
late	1
years	1
the	1
Manilla	1
rope	1
has	1
in	1
the	1
American	1
fishery	1
almost	1
entirely	1
superseded	1
hemp	1
as	1
a	1
material	1
for	1
whale-lines;	1
for,	1
though	1
not	1
so	1
durable	1
as	1
hemp,	1
it	1
is	1
stronger,	1
and	1
far	1
more	1
soft	1
and	1
elastic;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
add	1
(since	1
there	1
is	1
an	1
aesthetics	1
in	1
all	1
things),	1
is	1
much	1
more	1
handsome	1
and	1
becoming	1
to	1
the	1
boat,	1
than	1
hemp.	1
Hemp	1
is	1
a	1
dusky,	1
dark	1
fellow,	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
Indian;	1
but	1
Manilla	1
is	1
as	1
a	1
golden-haired	1
Circassian	1
to	1
behold.	1
The	1
whale-line	1
is	1
only	1
two-thirds	1
of	1
an	1
inch	1
in	1
thickness.	1
At	1
first	1
sight,	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
think	1
it	1
so	1
strong	1
as	1
it	1
really	1
is.	1
By	1
experiment	1
its	1
one	1
and	1
fifty	1
yarns	1
will	1
each	1
suspend	1
a	1
weight	1
of	1
one	1
hundred	1
and	1
twenty	1
pounds;	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
whole	1
rope	1
will	1
bear	1
a	1
strain	1
nearly	1
equal	1
to	1
three	1
tons.	1
In	1
length,	1
the	1
common	1
sperm	1
whale-line	1
measures	1
something	1
over	1
two	1
hundred	1
fathoms.	1
Towards	1
the	1
stern	1
of	1
the	1
boat	1
it	1
is	1
spirally	1
coiled	1
away	1
in	1
the	1
tub,	1
not	1
like	1
the	1
worm-pipe	1
of	1
a	1
still	1
though,	1
but	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
form	1
one	1
round,	1
cheese-shaped	1
mass	1
of	1
densely	1
bedded	1
"sheaves,"	1
or	1
layers	1
of	1
concentric	1
spiralizations,	1
without	1
any	1
hollow	1
but	1
the	1
"heart,"	1
or	1
minute	1
vertical	1
tube	1
formed	1
at	1
the	1
axis	1
of	1
the	1
cheese.	1
As	1
the	1
least	1
tangle	1
or	1
kink	1
in	1
the	1
coiling	1
would,	1
in	1
running	1
out,	1
infallibly	1
take	1
somebody's	1
arm,	1
leg,	1
or	1
entire	1
body	1
off,	1
the	1
utmost	1
precaution	1
is	1
used	1
in	1
stowing	1
the	1
line	1
in	1
its	1
tub.	1
Some	1
harpooneers	1
will	1
consume	1
almost	1
an	1
entire	1
morning	1
in	1
this	1
business,	1
carrying	1
the	1
line	1
high	1
aloft	1
and	1
then	1
reeving	1
it	1
downwards	1
through	1
a	1
block	1
towards	1
the	1
tub,	1
so	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
act	1
of	1
coiling	1
to	1
free	1
it	1
from	1
all	1
possible	1
wrinkles	1
and	1
twists.	1
In	1
the	1
English	1
boats	1
two	1
tubs	1
are	1
used	1
instead	1
of	1
one;	1
the	1
same	1
line	1
being	1
continuously	1
coiled	1
in	1
both	1
tubs.	1
There	1
is	1
some	1
advantage	1
in	1
this;	1
because	1
these	1
twin-tubs	1
being	1
so	1
small	1
they	1
fit	1
more	1
readily	1
into	1
the	1
boat,	1
and	1
do	1
not	1
strain	1
it	1
so	1
much;	1
whereas,	1
the	1
American	1
tub,	1
nearly	1
three	1
feet	1
in	1
diameter	1
and	1
of	1
proportionate	1
depth,	1
makes	1
a	1
rather	1
bulky	1
freight	1
for	1
a	1
craft	1
whose	1
planks	1
are	1
but	1
one	1
half-inch	1
in	1
thickness;	1
for	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
whale-boat	1
is	1
like	1
critical	1
ice,	1
which	1
will	1
bear	1
up	1
a	1
considerable	1
distributed	1
weight,	1
but	1
not	1
very	1
much	1
of	1
a	1
concentrated	1
one.	1
When	1
the	1
painted	1
canvas	1
cover	1
is	1
clapped	1
on	1
the	1
American	1
line-tub,	1
the	1
boat	1
looks	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
pulling	1
off	1
with	1
a	1
prodigious	1
great	1
wedding-cake	1
to	1
present	1
to	1
the	1
whales.	1
Both	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
line	1
are	1
exposed;	1
the	1
lower	1
end	1
terminating	1
in	1
an	1
eye-splice	1
or	1
loop	1
coming	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
bottom	1
against	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
tub,	1
and	1
hanging	1
over	1
its	1
edge	1
completely	1
disengaged	1
from	1
everything.	1
This	1
arrangement	1
of	1
the	1
lower	1
end	1
is	1
necessary	1
on	1
two	1
accounts.	1
First:	1
In	1
order	1
to	1
facilitate	1
the	1
fastening	1
to	1
it	1
of	1
an	1
additional	1
line	1
from	1
a	1
neighboring	1
boat,	1
in	1
case	1
the	1
stricken	1
whale	1
should	1
sound	1
so	1
deep	1
as	1
to	1
threaten	1
to	1
carry	1
off	1
the	1
entire	1
line	1
originally	1
attached	1
to	1
the	1
harpoon.	1
In	1
these	1
instances,	1
the	1
whale	1
of	1
course	1
is	1
shifted	1
like	1
a	1
mug	1
of	1
ale,	1
as	1
it	1
were,	1
from	1
the	1
one	1
boat	1
to	1
the	1
other;	1
though	1
the	1
first	1
boat	1
always	1
hovers	1
at	1
hand	1
to	1
assist	1
its	1
consort.	1
Second:	1
This	1
arrangement	1
is	1
indispensable	1
for	1
common	1
safety's	1
sake;	1
for	1
were	1
the	1
lower	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
line	1
in	1
any	1
way	1
attached	1
to	1
the	1
boat,	1
and	1
were	1
the	1
whale	1
then	1
to	1
run	1
the	1
line	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
almost	1
in	1
a	1
single,	1
smoking	1
minute	1
as	1
he	1
sometimes	1
does,	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
stop	1
there,	1
for	1
the	1
doomed	1
boat	1
would	1
infallibly	1
be	1
dragged	1
down	1
after	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
profundity	1
of	1
the	1
sea;	1
and	1
in	1
that	1
case	1
no	1
town-crier	1
would	1
ever	1
find	1
her	1
again.	1
Before	1
lowering	1
the	1
boat	1
for	1
the	1
chase,	1
the	1
upper	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
line	1
is	1
taken	1
aft	1
from	1
the	1
tub,	1
and	1
passing	1
round	1
the	1
loggerhead	1
there,	1
is	1
again	1
carried	1
forward	1
the	1
entire	1
length	1
of	1
the	1
boat,	1
resting	1
crosswise	1
upon	1
the	1
loom	1
or	1
handle	1
of	1
every	1
man's	1
oar,	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
jogs	1
against	1
his	1
wrist	1
in	1
rowing;	1
and	1
also	1
passing	1
between	1
the	1
men,	1
as	1
they	1
alternately	1
sit	1
at	1
the	1
opposite	1
gunwales,	1
to	1
the	1
leaded	1
chocks	1
or	1
grooves	1
in	1
the	1
extreme	1
pointed	1
prow	1
of	1
the	1
boat,	1
where	1
a	1
wooden	1
pin	1
or	1
skewer	1
the	1
size	1
of	1
a	1
common	1
quill,	1
prevents	1
it	1
from	1
slipping	1
out.	1
From	1
the	1
chocks	1
it	1
hangs	1
in	1
a	1
slight	1
festoon	1
over	1
the	1
bows,	1
and	1
is	1
then	1
passed	1
inside	1
the	1
boat	1
again;	1
and	1
some	1
ten	1
or	1
twenty	1
fathoms	1
(called	1
box-line)	1
being	1
coiled	1
upon	1
the	1
box	1
in	1
the	1
bows,	1
it	1
continues	1
its	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
gunwale	1
still	1
a	1
little	1
further	1
aft,	1
and	1
is	1
then	1
attached	1
to	1
the	1
short-warp--the	1
rope	1
which	1
is	1
immediately	1
connected	1
with	1
the	1
harpoon;	1
but	1
previous	1
to	1
that	1
connexion,	1
the	1
short-warp	1
goes	1
through	1
sundry	1
mystifications	1
too	1
tedious	1
to	1
detail.	1
Thus	1
the	1
whale-line	1
folds	1
the	1
whole	1
boat	1
in	1
its	1
complicated	1
coils,	1
twisting	1
and	1
writhing	1
around	1
it	1
in	1
almost	1
every	1
direction.	1
All	1
the	1
oarsmen	1
are	1
involved	1
in	1
its	1
perilous	1
contortions;	1
so	1
that	1
to	1
the	1
timid	1
eye	1
of	1
the	1
landsman,	1
they	1
seem	1
as	1
Indian	1
jugglers,	1
with	1
the	1
deadliest	1
snakes	1
sportively	1
festooning	1
their	1
limbs.	1
Nor	1
can	1
any	1
son	1
of	1
mortal	1
woman,	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time,	1
seat	1
himself	1
amid	1
those	1
hempen	1
intricacies,	1
and	1
while	1
straining	1
his	1
utmost	1
at	1
the	1
oar,	1
bethink	1
him	1
that	1
at	1
any	1
unknown	1
instant	1
the	1
harpoon	1
may	1
be	1
darted,	1
and	1
all	1
these	1
horrible	1
contortions	1
be	1
put	1
in	1
play	1
like	1
ringed	1
lightnings;	1
he	1
cannot	1
be	1
thus	1
circumstanced	1
without	1
a	1
shudder	1
that	1
makes	1
the	1
very	1
marrow	1
in	1
his	1
bones	1
to	1
quiver	1
in	1
him	1
like	1
a	1
shaken	1
jelly.	1
Yet	1
habit--strange	1
thing!	1
what	1
cannot	1
habit	1
accomplish?--Gayer	1
sallies,	1
more	1
merry	1
mirth,	1
better	1
jokes,	1
and	1
brighter	1
repartees,	1
you	1
never	1
heard	1
over	1
your	1
mahogany,	1
than	1
you	1
will	1
hear	1
over	1
the	1
half-inch	1
white	1
cedar	1
of	1
the	1
whale-boat,	1
when	1
thus	1
hung	1
in	1
hangman's	1
nooses;	1
and,	1
like	1
the	1
six	1
burghers	1
of	1
Calais	1
before	1
King	1
Edward,	1
the	1
six	1
men	1
composing	1
the	1
crew	1
pull	1
into	1
the	1
jaws	1
of	1
death,	1
with	1
a	1
halter	1
around	1
every	1
neck,	1
as	1
you	1
may	1
say.	1
Perhaps	1
a	1
very	1
little	1
thought	1
will	1
now	1
enable	1
you	1
to	1
account	1
for	1
those	1
repeated	1
whaling	1
disasters--some	1
few	1
of	1
which	1
are	1
casually	1
chronicled--of	1
this	1
man	1
or	1
that	1
man	1
being	1
taken	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
boat	1
by	1
the	1
line,	1
and	1
lost.	1
For,	1
when	1
the	1
line	1
is	1
darting	1
out,	1
to	1
be	1
seated	1
then	1
in	1
the	1
boat,	1
is	1
like	1
being	1
seated	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
manifold	1
whizzings	1
of	1
a	1
steam-engine	1
in	1
full	1
play,	1
when	1
every	1
flying	1
beam,	1
and	1
shaft,	1
and	1
wheel,	1
is	1
grazing	1
you.	1
It	1
is	1
worse;	1
for	1
you	1
cannot	1
sit	1
motionless	1
in	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
these	1
perils,	1
because	1
the	1
boat	1
is	1
rocking	1
like	1
a	1
cradle,	1
and	1
you	1
are	1
pitched	1
one	1
way	1
and	1
the	1
other,	1
without	1
the	1
slightest	1
warning;	1
and	1
only	1
by	1
a	1
certain	1
self-adjusting	1
buoyancy	1
and	1
simultaneousness	1
of	1
volition	1
and	1
action,	1
can	1
you	1
escape	1
being	1
made	1
a	1
Mazeppa	1
of,	1
and	1
run	1
away	1
with	1
where	1
the	1
all-seeing	1
sun	1
himself	1
could	1
never	1
pierce	1
you	1
out.	1
Again:	1
as	1
the	1
profound	1
calm	1
which	1
only	1
apparently	1
precedes	1
and	1
prophesies	1
of	1
the	1
storm,	1
is	1
perhaps	1
more	1
awful	1
than	1
the	1
storm	1
itself;	1
for,	1
indeed,	1
the	1
calm	1
is	1
but	1
the	1
wrapper	1
and	1
envelope	1
of	1
the	1
storm;	1
and	1
contains	1
it	1
in	1
itself,	1
as	1
the	1
seemingly	1
harmless	1
rifle	1
holds	1
the	1
fatal	1
powder,	1
and	1
the	1
ball,	1
and	1
the	1
explosion;	1
so	1
the	1
graceful	1
repose	1
of	1
the	1
line,	1
as	1
it	1
silently	1
serpentines	1
about	1
the	1
oarsmen	1
before	1
being	1
brought	1
into	1
actual	1
play--this	1
is	1
a	1
thing	1
which	1
carries	1
more	1
of	1
true	1
terror	1
than	1
any	1
other	1
aspect	1
of	1
this	1
dangerous	1
affair.	1
But	1
why	1
say	1
more?	1
All	1
men	1
live	1
enveloped	1
in	1
whale-lines.	1
All	1
are	1
born	1
with	1
halters	1
round	1
their	1
necks;	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
when	1
caught	1
in	1
the	1
swift,	1
sudden	1
turn	1
of	1
death,	1
that	1
mortals	1
realize	1
the	1
silent,	1
subtle,	1
ever-present	1
perils	1
of	1
life.	1
And	1
if	1
you	1
be	1
a	1
philosopher,	1
though	1
seated	1
in	1
the	1
whale-boat,	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
at	1
heart	1
feel	1
one	1
whit	1
more	1
of	1
terror,	1
than	1
though	1
seated	1
before	1
your	1
evening	1
fire	1
with	1
a	1
poker,	1
and	1
not	1
a	1
harpoon,	1
by	1
your	1
side.	1
CHAPTER	1
61	1
Stubb	1
Kills	1
a	1
Whale.	1
If	1
to	1
Starbuck	1
the	1
apparition	1
of	1
the	1
Squid	1
was	1
a	1
thing	1
of	1
portents,	1
to	1
Queequeg	1
it	1
was	1
quite	1
a	1
different	1
object.	1
"When	1
you	1
see	1
him	1
'quid,"	1
said	1
the	1
savage,	1
honing	1
his	1
harpoon	1
in	1
the	1
bow	1
of	1
his	1
hoisted	1
boat,	1
"then	1
you	1
quick	1
see	1
him	1
'parm	1
whale."	1
The	1
next	1
day	1
was	1
exceedingly	1
still	1
and	1
sultry,	1
and	1
with	1
nothing	1
special	1
to	1
engage	1
them,	1
the	1
Pequod's	1
crew	1
could	1
hardly	1
resist	1
the	1
spell	1
of	1
sleep	1
induced	1
by	1
such	1
a	1
vacant	1
sea.	1
For	1
this	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
Indian	1
Ocean	1
through	1
which	1
we	1
then	1
were	1
voyaging	1
is	1
not	1
what	1
whalemen	1
call	1
a	1
lively	1
ground;	1
that	1
is,	1
it	1
affords	1
fewer	1
glimpses	1
of	1
porpoises,	1
dolphins,	1
flying-fish,	1
and	1
other	1
vivacious	1
denizens	1
of	1
more	1
stirring	1
waters,	1
than	1
those	1
off	1
the	1
Rio	1
de	1
la	1
Plata,	1
or	1
the	1
in-shore	1
ground	1
off	1
Peru.	1
It	1
was	1
my	1
turn	1
to	1
stand	1
at	1
the	1
foremast-head;	1
and	1
with	1
my	1
shoulders	1
leaning	1
against	1
the	1
slackened	1
royal	1
shrouds,	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
I	1
idly	1
swayed	1
in	1
what	1
seemed	1
an	1
enchanted	1
air.	1
No	1
resolution	1
could	1
withstand	1
it;	1
in	1
that	1
dreamy	1
mood	1
losing	1
all	1
consciousness,	1
at	1
last	1
my	1
soul	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
body;	1
though	1
my	1
body	1
still	1
continued	1
to	1
sway	1
as	1
a	1
pendulum	1
will,	1
long	1
after	1
the	1
power	1
which	1
first	1
moved	1
it	1
is	1
withdrawn.	1
Ere	1
forgetfulness	1
altogether	1
came	1
over	1
me,	1
I	1
had	1
noticed	1
that	1
the	1
seamen	1
at	1
the	1
main	1
and	1
mizzen-mast-heads	1
were	1
already	1
drowsy.	1
So	1
that	1
at	1
last	1
all	1
three	1
of	1
us	1
lifelessly	1
swung	1
from	1
the	1
spars,	1
and	1
for	1
every	1
swing	1
that	1
we	1
made	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
nod	1
from	1
below	1
from	1
the	1
slumbering	1
helmsman.	1
The	1
waves,	1
too,	1
nodded	1
their	1
indolent	1
crests;	1
and	1
across	1
the	1
wide	1
trance	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
east	1
nodded	1
to	1
west,	1
and	1
the	1
sun	1
over	1
all.	1
Suddenly	1
bubbles	1
seemed	1
bursting	1
beneath	1
my	1
closed	1
eyes;	1
like	1
vices	1
my	1
hands	1
grasped	1
the	1
shrouds;	1
some	1
invisible,	1
gracious	1
agency	1
preserved	1
me;	1
with	1
a	1
shock	1
I	1
came	1
back	1
to	1
life.	1
And	1
lo!	1
close	1
under	1
our	1
lee,	1
not	1
forty	1
fathoms	1
off,	1
a	1
gigantic	1
Sperm	1
Whale	1
lay	1
rolling	1
in	1
the	1
water	1
like	1
the	1
capsized	1
hull	1
of	1
a	1
frigate,	1
his	1
broad,	1
glossy	1
back,	1
of	1
an	1
Ethiopian	1
hue,	1
glistening	1
in	1
the	1
sun's	1
rays	1
like	1
a	1
mirror.	1
But	1
lazily	1
undulating	1
in	1
the	1
trough	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
ever	1
and	1
anon	1
tranquilly	1
spouting	1
his	1
vapoury	1
jet,	1
the	1
whale	1
looked	1
like	1
a	1
portly	1
burgher	1
smoking	1
his	1
pipe	1
of	1
a	1
warm	1
afternoon.	1
But	1
that	1
pipe,	1
poor	1
whale,	1
was	1
thy	1
last.	1
As	1
if	1
struck	1
by	1
some	1
enchanter's	1
wand,	1
the	1
sleepy	1
ship	1
and	1
every	1
sleeper	1
in	1
it	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
started	1
into	1
wakefulness;	1
and	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
score	1
of	1
voices	1
from	1
all	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
vessel,	1
simultaneously	1
with	1
the	1
three	1
notes	1
from	1
aloft,	1
shouted	1
forth	1
the	1
accustomed	1
cry,	1
as	1
the	1
great	1
fish	1
slowly	1
and	1
regularly	1
spouted	1
the	1
sparkling	1
brine	1
into	1
the	1
air.	1
"Clear	1
away	1
the	1
boats!	1
Luff!"	1
cried	1
Ahab.	1
And	1
obeying	1
his	1
own	1
order,	1
he	1
dashed	1
the	1
helm	1
down	1
before	1
the	1
helmsman	1
could	1
handle	1
the	1
spokes.	1
The	1
sudden	1
exclamations	1
of	1
the	1
crew	1
must	1
have	1
alarmed	1
the	1
whale;	1
and	1
ere	1
the	1
boats	1
were	1
down,	1
majestically	1
turning,	1
he	1
swam	1
away	1
to	1
the	1
leeward,	1
but	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
steady	1
tranquillity,	1
and	1
making	1
so	1
few	1
ripples	1
as	1
he	1
swam,	1
that	1
thinking	1
after	1
all	1
he	1
might	1
not	1
as	1
yet	1
be	1
alarmed,	1
Ahab	1
gave	1
orders	1
that	1
not	1
an	1
oar	1
should	1
be	1
used,	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
must	1
speak	1
but	1
in	1
whispers.	1
So	1
seated	1
like	1
Ontario	1
Indians	1
on	1
the	1
gunwales	1
of	1
the	1
boats,	1
we	1
swiftly	1
but	1
silently	1
paddled	1
along;	1
the	1
calm	1
not	1
admitting	1
of	1
the	1
noiseless	1
sails	1
being	1
set.	1
Presently,	1
as	1
we	1
thus	1
glided	1
in	1
chase,	1
the	1
monster	1
perpendicularly	1
flitted	1
his	1
tail	1
forty	1
feet	1
into	1
the	1
air,	1
and	1
then	1
sank	1
out	1
of	1
sight	1
like	1
a	1
tower	1
swallowed	1
up.	1
"There	1
go	1
flukes!"	1
was	1
the	1
cry,	1
an	1
announcement	1
immediately	1
followed	1
by	1
Stubb's	1
producing	1
his	1
match	1
and	1
igniting	1
his	1
pipe,	1
for	1
now	1
a	1
respite	1
was	1
granted.	1
After	1
the	1
full	1
interval	1
of	1
his	1
sounding	1
had	1
elapsed,	1
the	1
whale	1
rose	1
again,	1
and	1
being	1
now	1
in	1
advance	1
of	1
the	1
smoker's	1
boat,	1
and	1
much	1
nearer	1
to	1
it	1
than	1
to	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
others,	1
Stubb	1
counted	1
upon	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
the	1
capture.	1
It	1
was	1
obvious,	1
now,	1
that	1
the	1
whale	1
had	1
at	1
length	1
become	1
aware	1
of	1
his	1
pursuers.	1
All	1
silence	1
of	1
cautiousness	1
was	1
therefore	1
no	1
longer	1
of	1
use.	1
Paddles	1
were	1
dropped,	1
and	1
oars	1
came	1
loudly	1
into	1
play.	1
And	1
still	1
puffing	1
at	1
his	1
pipe,	1
Stubb	1
cheered	1
on	1
his	1
crew	1
to	1
the	1
assault.	1
Yes,	1
a	1
mighty	1
change	1
had	1
come	1
over	1
the	1
fish.	1
All	1
alive	1
to	1
his	1
jeopardy,	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
"head	1
out";	1
that	1
part	1
obliquely	1
projecting	1
from	1
the	1
mad	1
yeast	1
which	1
he	1
brewed.*	1
*It	1
will	1
be	1
seen	1
in	1
some	1
other	1
place	1
of	1
what	1
a	1
very	1
light	1
substance	1
the	1
entire	1
interior	1
of	1
the	1
sperm	1
whale's	1
enormous	1
head	1
consists.	1
Though	1
apparently	1
the	1
most	1
massive,	1
it	1
is	1
by	1
far	1
the	1
most	1
buoyant	1
part	1
about	1
him.	1
So	1
that	1
with	1
ease	1
he	1
elevates	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
air,	1
and	1
invariably	1
does	1
so	1
when	1
going	1
at	1
his	1
utmost	1
speed.	1
Besides,	1
such	1
is	1
the	1
breadth	1
of	1
the	1
upper	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
front	1
of	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
such	1
the	1
tapering	1
cut-water	1
formation	1
of	1
the	1
lower	1
part,	1
that	1
by	1
obliquely	1
elevating	1
his	1
head,	1
he	1
thereby	1
may	1
be	1
said	1
to	1
transform	1
himself	1
from	1
a	1
bluff-bowed	1
sluggish	1
galliot	1
into	1
a	1
sharppointed	1
New	1
York	1
pilot-boat.	1
"Start	1
her,	1
start	1
her,	1
my	1
men!	1
Don't	1
hurry	1
yourselves;	1
take	1
plenty	1
of	1
time--but	1
start	1
her;	1
start	1
her	1
like	1
thunder-claps,	1
that's	1
all,"	1
cried	1
Stubb,	1
spluttering	1
out	1
the	1
smoke	1
as	1
he	1
spoke.	1
"Start	1
her,	1
now;	1
give	1
'em	1
the	1
long	1
and	1
strong	1
stroke,	1
Tashtego.	1
Start	1
her,	1
Tash,	1
my	1
boy--start	1
her,	1
all;	1
but	1
keep	1
cool,	1
keep	1
cool--cucumbers	1
is	1
the	1
word--easy,	1
easy--only	1
start	1
her	1
like	1
grim	1
death	1
and	1
grinning	1
devils,	1
and	1
raise	1
the	1
buried	1
dead	1
perpendicular	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
graves,	1
boys--that's	1
all.	1
Start	1
her!"	1
"Woo-hoo!	1
Wa-hee!"	1
screamed	1
the	1
Gay-Header	1
in	1
reply,	1
raising	1
some	1
old	1
war-whoop	1
to	1
the	1
skies;	1
as	1
every	1
oarsman	1
in	1
the	1
strained	1
boat	1
involuntarily	1
bounced	1
forward	1
with	1
the	1
one	1
tremendous	1
leading	1
stroke	1
which	1
the	1
eager	1
Indian	1
gave.	1
But	1
his	1
wild	1
screams	1
were	1
answered	1
by	1
others	1
quite	1
as	1
wild.	1
"Kee-hee!	1
Kee-hee!"	1
yelled	1
Daggoo,	1
straining	1
forwards	1
and	1
backwards	1
on	1
his	1
seat,	1
like	1
a	1
pacing	1
tiger	1
in	1
his	1
cage.	1
"Ka-la!	1
Koo-loo!"	1
howled	1
Queequeg,	1
as	1
if	1
smacking	1
his	1
lips	1
over	1
a	1
mouthful	1
of	1
Grenadier's	1
steak.	1
And	1
thus	1
with	1
oars	1
and	1
yells	1
the	1
keels	1
cut	1
the	1
sea.	1
Meanwhile,	1
Stubb	1
retaining	1
his	1
place	1
in	1
the	1
van,	1
still	1
encouraged	1
his	1
men	1
to	1
the	1
onset,	1
all	1
the	1
while	1
puffing	1
the	1
smoke	1
from	1
his	1
mouth.	1
Like	1
desperadoes	1
they	1
tugged	1
and	1
they	1
strained,	1
till	1
the	1
welcome	1
cry	1
was	1
heard--"Stand	1
up,	1
Tashtego!--give	1
it	1
to	1
him!"	1
The	1
harpoon	1
was	1
hurled.	1
"Stern	1
all!"	1
The	1
oarsmen	1
backed	1
water;	1
the	1
same	1
moment	1
something	1
went	1
hot	1
and	1
hissing	1
along	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
their	1
wrists.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
magical	1
line.	1
An	1
instant	1
before,	1
Stubb	1
had	1
swiftly	1
caught	1
two	1
additional	1
turns	1
with	1
it	1
round	1
the	1
loggerhead,	1
whence,	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
its	1
increased	1
rapid	1
circlings,	1
a	1
hempen	1
blue	1
smoke	1
now	1
jetted	1
up	1
and	1
mingled	1
with	1
the	1
steady	1
fumes	1
from	1
his	1
pipe.	1
As	1
the	1
line	1
passed	1
round	1
and	1
round	1
the	1
loggerhead;	1
so	1
also,	1
just	1
before	1
reaching	1
that	1
point,	1
it	1
blisteringly	1
passed	1
through	1
and	1
through	1
both	1
of	1
Stubb's	1
hands,	1
from	1
which	1
the	1
hand-cloths,	1
or	1
squares	1
of	1
quilted	1
canvas	1
sometimes	1
worn	1
at	1
these	1
times,	1
had	1
accidentally	1
dropped.	1
It	1
was	1
like	1
holding	1
an	1
enemy's	1
sharp	1
two-edged	1
sword	1
by	1
the	1
blade,	1
and	1
that	1
enemy	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
striving	1
to	1
wrest	1
it	1
out	1
of	1
your	1
clutch.	1
"Wet	1
the	1
line!	1
wet	1
the	1
line!"	1
cried	1
Stubb	1
to	1
the	1
tub	1
oarsman	1
(him	1
seated	1
by	1
the	1
tub)	1
who,	1
snatching	1
off	1
his	1
hat,	1
dashed	1
sea-water	1
into	1
it.*	1
More	1
turns	1
were	1
taken,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
line	1
began	1
holding	1
its	1
place.	1
The	1
boat	1
now	1
flew	1
through	1
the	1
boiling	1
water	1
like	1
a	1
shark	1
all	1
fins.	1
Stubb	1
and	1
Tashtego	1
here	1
changed	1
places--stem	1
for	1
stern--a	1
staggering	1
business	1
truly	1
in	1
that	1
rocking	1
commotion.	1
*Partly	1
to	1
show	1
the	1
indispensableness	1
of	1
this	1
act,	1
it	1
may	1
here	1
be	1
stated,	1
that,	1
in	1
the	1
old	1
Dutch	1
fishery,	1
a	1
mop	1
was	1
used	1
to	1
dash	1
the	1
running	1
line	1
with	1
water;	1
in	1
many	1
other	1
ships,	1
a	1
wooden	1
piggin,	1
or	1
bailer,	1
is	1
set	1
apart	1
for	1
that	1
purpose.	1
Your	1
hat,	1
however,	1
is	1
the	1
most	1
convenient.	1
From	1
the	1
vibrating	1
line	1
extending	1
the	1
entire	1
length	1
of	1
the	1
upper	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
boat,	1
and	1
from	1
its	1
now	1
being	1
more	1
tight	1
than	1
a	1
harpstring,	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
thought	1
the	1
craft	1
had	1
two	1
keels--one	1
cleaving	1
the	1
water,	1
the	1
other	1
the	1
air--as	1
the	1
boat	1
churned	1
on	1
through	1
both	1
opposing	1
elements	1
at	1
once.	1
A	1
continual	1
cascade	1
played	1
at	1
the	1
bows;	1
a	1
ceaseless	1
whirling	1
eddy	1
in	1
her	1
wake;	1
and,	1
at	1
the	1
slightest	1
motion	1
from	1
within,	1
even	1
but	1
of	1
a	1
little	1
finger,	1
the	1
vibrating,	1
cracking	1
craft	1
canted	1
over	1
her	1
spasmodic	1
gunwale	1
into	1
the	1
sea.	1
Thus	1
they	1
rushed;	1
each	1
man	1
with	1
might	1
and	1
main	1
clinging	1
to	1
his	1
seat,	1
to	1
prevent	1
being	1
tossed	1
to	1
the	1
foam;	1
and	1
the	1
tall	1
form	1
of	1
Tashtego	1
at	1
the	1
steering	1
oar	1
crouching	1
almost	1
double,	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
bring	1
down	1
his	1
centre	1
of	1
gravity.	1
Whole	1
Atlantics	1
and	1
Pacifics	1
seemed	1
passed	1
as	1
they	1
shot	1
on	1
their	1
way,	1
till	1
at	1
length	1
the	1
whale	1
somewhat	1
slackened	1
his	1
flight.	1
"Haul	1
in--haul	1
in!"	1
cried	1
Stubb	1
to	1
the	1
bowsman!	1
and,	1
facing	1
round	1
towards	1
the	1
whale,	1
all	1
hands	1
began	1
pulling	1
the	1
boat	1
up	1
to	1
him,	1
while	1
yet	1
the	1
boat	1
was	1
being	1
towed	1
on.	1
Soon	1
ranging	1
up	1
by	1
his	1
flank,	1
Stubb,	1
firmly	1
planting	1
his	1
knee	1
in	1
the	1
clumsy	1
cleat,	1
darted	1
dart	1
after	1
dart	1
into	1
the	1
flying	1
fish;	1
at	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
command,	1
the	1
boat	1
alternately	1
sterning	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
whale's	1
horrible	1
wallow,	1
and	1
then	1
ranging	1
up	1
for	1
another	1
fling.	1
The	1
red	1
tide	1
now	1
poured	1
from	1
all	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
monster	1
like	1
brooks	1
down	1
a	1
hill.	1
His	1
tormented	1
body	1
rolled	1
not	1
in	1
brine	1
but	1
in	1
blood,	1
which	1
bubbled	1
and	1
seethed	1
for	1
furlongs	1
behind	1
in	1
their	1
wake.	1
The	1
slanting	1
sun	1
playing	1
upon	1
this	1
crimson	1
pond	1
in	1
the	1
sea,	1
sent	1
back	1
its	1
reflection	1
into	1
every	1
face,	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
all	1
glowed	1
to	1
each	1
other	1
like	1
red	1
men.	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
while,	1
jet	1
after	1
jet	1
of	1
white	1
smoke	1
was	1
agonizingly	1
shot	1
from	1
the	1
spiracle	1
of	1
the	1
whale,	1
and	1
vehement	1
puff	1
after	1
puff	1
from	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
excited	1
headsman;	1
as	1
at	1
every	1
dart,	1
hauling	1
in	1
upon	1
his	1
crooked	1
lance	1
(by	1
the	1
line	1
attached	1
to	1
it),	1
Stubb	1
straightened	1
it	1
again	1
and	1
again,	1
by	1
a	1
few	1
rapid	1
blows	1
against	1
the	1
gunwale,	1
then	1
again	1
and	1
again	1
sent	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
whale.	1
"Pull	1
up--pull	1
up!"	1
he	1
now	1
cried	1
to	1
the	1
bowsman,	1
as	1
the	1
waning	1
whale	1
relaxed	1
in	1
his	1
wrath.	1
"Pull	1
up!--close	1
to!"	1
and	1
the	1
boat	1
ranged	1
along	1
the	1
fish's	1
flank.	1
When	1
reaching	1
far	1
over	1
the	1
bow,	1
Stubb	1
slowly	1
churned	1
his	1
long	1
sharp	1
lance	1
into	1
the	1
fish,	1
and	1
kept	1
it	1
there,	1
carefully	1
churning	1
and	1
churning,	1
as	1
if	1
cautiously	1
seeking	1
to	1
feel	1
after	1
some	1
gold	1
watch	1
that	1
the	1
whale	1
might	1
have	1
swallowed,	1
and	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
fearful	1
of	1
breaking	1
ere	1
he	1
could	1
hook	1
it	1
out.	1
But	1
that	1
gold	1
watch	1
he	1
sought	1
was	1
the	1
innermost	1
life	1
of	1
the	1
fish.	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
is	1
struck;	1
for,	1
starting	1
from	1
his	1
trance	1
into	1
that	1
unspeakable	1
thing	1
called	1
his	1
"flurry,"	1
the	1
monster	1
horribly	1
wallowed	1
in	1
his	1
blood,	1
overwrapped	1
himself	1
in	1
impenetrable,	1
mad,	1
boiling	1
spray,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
imperilled	1
craft,	1
instantly	1
dropping	1
astern,	1
had	1
much	1
ado	1
blindly	1
to	1
struggle	1
out	1
from	1
that	1
phrensied	1
twilight	1
into	1
the	1
clear	1
air	1
of	1
the	1
day.	1
And	1
now	1
abating	1
in	1
his	1
flurry,	1
the	1
whale	1
once	1
more	1
rolled	1
out	1
into	1
view;	1
surging	1
from	1
side	1
to	1
side;	1
spasmodically	1
dilating	1
and	1
contracting	1
his	1
spout-hole,	1
with	1
sharp,	1
cracking,	1
agonized	1
respirations.	1
At	1
last,	1
gush	1
after	1
gush	1
of	1
clotted	1
red	1
gore,	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
purple	1
lees	1
of	1
red	1
wine,	1
shot	1
into	1
the	1
frighted	1
air;	1
and	1
falling	1
back	1
again,	1
ran	1
dripping	1
down	1
his	1
motionless	1
flanks	1
into	1
the	1
sea.	1
His	1
heart	1
had	1
burst!	1
"He's	1
dead,	1
Mr.	1
Stubb,"	1
said	1
Daggoo.	1
"Yes;	1
both	1
pipes	1
smoked	1
out!"	1
and	1
withdrawing	1
his	1
own	1
from	1
his	1
mouth,	1
Stubb	1
scattered	1
the	1
dead	1
ashes	1
over	1
the	1
water;	1
and,	1
for	1
a	1
moment,	1
stood	1
thoughtfully	1
eyeing	1
the	1
vast	1
corpse	1
he	1
had	1
made.	1
CHAPTER	1
62	1
The	1
Dart.	1
A	1
word	1
concerning	1
an	1
incident	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
chapter.	1
According	1
to	1
the	1
invariable	1
usage	1
of	1
the	1
fishery,	1
the	1
whale-boat	1
pushes	1
off	1
from	1
the	1
ship,	1
with	1
the	1
headsman	1
or	1
whale-killer	1
as	1
temporary	1
steersman,	1
and	1
the	1
harpooneer	1
or	1
whale-fastener	1
pulling	1
the	1
foremost	1
oar,	1
the	1
one	1
known	1
as	1
the	1
harpooneer-oar.	1
Now	1
it	1
needs	1
a	1
strong,	1
nervous	1
arm	1
to	1
strike	1
the	1
first	1
iron	1
into	1
the	1
fish;	1
for	1
often,	1
in	1
what	1
is	1
called	1
a	1
long	1
dart,	1
the	1
heavy	1
implement	1
has	1
to	1
be	1
flung	1
to	1
the	1
distance	1
of	1
twenty	1
or	1
thirty	1
feet.	1
But	1
however	1
prolonged	1
and	1
exhausting	1
the	1
chase,	1
the	1
harpooneer	1
is	1
expected	1
to	1
pull	1
his	1
oar	1
meanwhile	1
to	1
the	1
uttermost;	1
indeed,	1
he	1
is	1
expected	1
to	1
set	1
an	1
example	1
of	1
superhuman	1
activity	1
to	1
the	1
rest,	1
not	1
only	1
by	1
incredible	1
rowing,	1
but	1
by	1
repeated	1
loud	1
and	1
intrepid	1
exclamations;	1
and	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
keep	1
shouting	1
at	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
one's	1
compass,	1
while	1
all	1
the	1
other	1
muscles	1
are	1
strained	1
and	1
half	1
started--what	1
that	1
is	1
none	1
know	1
but	1
those	1
who	1
have	1
tried	1
it.	1
For	1
one,	1
I	1
cannot	1
bawl	1
very	1
heartily	1
and	1
work	1
very	1
recklessly	1
at	1
one	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
time.	1
In	1
this	1
straining,	1
bawling	1
state,	1
then,	1
with	1
his	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
fish,	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
the	1
exhausted	1
harpooneer	1
hears	1
the	1
exciting	1
cry--"Stand	1
up,	1
and	1
give	1
it	1
to	1
him!"	1
He	1
now	1
has	1
to	1
drop	1
and	1
secure	1
his	1
oar,	1
turn	1
round	1
on	1
his	1
centre	1
half	1
way,	1
seize	1
his	1
harpoon	1
from	1
the	1
crotch,	1
and	1
with	1
what	1
little	1
strength	1
may	1
remain,	1
he	1
essays	1
to	1
pitch	1
it	1
somehow	1
into	1
the	1
whale.	1
No	1
wonder,	1
taking	1
the	1
whole	1
fleet	1
of	1
whalemen	1
in	1
a	1
body,	1
that	1
out	1
of	1
fifty	1
fair	1
chances	1
for	1
a	1
dart,	1
not	1
five	1
are	1
successful;	1
no	1
wonder	1
that	1
so	1
many	1
hapless	1
harpooneers	1
are	1
madly	1
cursed	1
and	1
disrated;	1
no	1
wonder	1
that	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
actually	1
burst	1
their	1
blood-vessels	1
in	1
the	1
boat;	1
no	1
wonder	1
that	1
some	1
sperm	1
whalemen	1
are	1
absent	1
four	1
years	1
with	1
four	1
barrels;	1
no	1
wonder	1
that	1
to	1
many	1
ship	1
owners,	1
whaling	1
is	1
but	1
a	1
losing	1
concern;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
harpooneer	1
that	1
makes	1
the	1
voyage,	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
take	1
the	1
breath	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
body	1
how	1
can	1
you	1
expect	1
to	1
find	1
it	1
there	1
when	1
most	1
wanted!	1
Again,	1
if	1
the	1
dart	1
be	1
successful,	1
then	1
at	1
the	1
second	1
critical	1
instant,	1
that	1
is,	1
when	1
the	1
whale	1
starts	1
to	1
run,	1
the	1
boatheader	1
and	1
harpooneer	1
likewise	1
start	1
to	1
running	1
fore	1
and	1
aft,	1
to	1
the	1
imminent	1
jeopardy	1
of	1
themselves	1
and	1
every	1
one	1
else.	1
It	1
is	1
then	1
they	1
change	1
places;	1
and	1
the	1
headsman,	1
the	1
chief	1
officer	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
craft,	1
takes	1
his	1
proper	1
station	1
in	1
the	1
bows	1
of	1
the	1
boat.	1
Now,	1
I	1
care	1
not	1
who	1
maintains	1
the	1
contrary,	1
but	1
all	1
this	1
is	1
both	1
foolish	1
and	1
unnecessary.	1
The	1
headsman	1
should	1
stay	1
in	1
the	1
bows	1
from	1
first	1
to	1
last;	1
he	1
should	1
both	1
dart	1
the	1
harpoon	1
and	1
the	1
lance,	1
and	1
no	1
rowing	1
whatever	1
should	1
be	1
expected	1
of	1
him,	1
except	1
under	1
circumstances	1
obvious	1
to	1
any	1
fisherman.	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
this	1
would	1
sometimes	1
involve	1
a	1
slight	1
loss	1
of	1
speed	1
in	1
the	1
chase;	1
but	1
long	1
experience	1
in	1
various	1
whalemen	1
of	1
more	1
than	1
one	1
nation	1
has	1
convinced	1
me	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
vast	1
majority	1
of	1
failures	1
in	1
the	1
fishery,	1
it	1
has	1
not	1
by	1
any	1
means	1
been	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
speed	1
of	1
the	1
whale	1
as	1
the	1
before	1
described	1
exhaustion	1
of	1
the	1
harpooneer	1
that	1
has	1
caused	1
them.	1
To	1
insure	1
the	1
greatest	1
efficiency	1
in	1
the	1
dart,	1
the	1
harpooneers	1
of	1
this	1
world	1
must	1
start	1
to	1
their	1
feet	1
from	1
out	1
of	1
idleness,	1
and	1
not	1
from	1
out	1
of	1
toil.	1
CHAPTER	1
63	1
The	1
Crotch.	1
Out	1
of	1
the	1
trunk,	1
the	1
branches	1
grow;	1
out	1
of	1
them,	1
the	1
twigs.	1
So,	1
in	1
productive	1
subjects,	1
grow	1
the	1
chapters.	1
The	1
crotch	1
alluded	1
to	1
on	1
a	1
previous	1
page	1
deserves	1
independent	1
mention.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
notched	1
stick	1
of	1
a	1
peculiar	1
form,	1
some	1
two	1
feet	1
in	1
length,	1
which	1
is	1
perpendicularly	1
inserted	1
into	1
the	1
starboard	1
gunwale	1
near	1
the	1
bow,	1
for	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
furnishing	1
a	1
rest	1
for	1
the	1
wooden	1
extremity	1
of	1
the	1
harpoon,	1
whose	1
other	1
naked,	1
barbed	1
end	1
slopingly	1
projects	1
from	1
the	1
prow.	1
Thereby	1
the	1
weapon	1
is	1
instantly	1
at	1
hand	1
to	1
its	1
hurler,	1
who	1
snatches	1
it	1
up	1
as	1
readily	1
from	1
its	1
rest	1
as	1
a	1
backwoodsman	1
swings	1
his	1
rifle	1
from	1
the	1
wall.	1
It	1
is	1
customary	1
to	1
have	1
two	1
harpoons	1
reposing	1
in	1
the	1
crotch,	1
respectively	1
called	1
the	1
first	1
and	1
second	1
irons.	1
But	1
these	1
two	1
harpoons,	1
each	1
by	1
its	1
own	1
cord,	1
are	1
both	1
connected	1
with	1
the	1
line;	1
the	1
object	1
being	1
this:	1
to	1
dart	1
them	1
both,	1
if	1
possible,	1
one	1
instantly	1
after	1
the	1
other	1
into	1
the	1
same	1
whale;	1
so	1
that	1
if,	1
in	1
the	1
coming	1
drag,	1
one	1
should	1
draw	1
out,	1
the	1
other	1
may	1
still	1
retain	1
a	1
hold.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
doubling	1
of	1
the	1
chances.	1
But	1
it	1
very	1
often	1
happens	1
that	1
owing	1
to	1
the	1
instantaneous,	1
violent,	1
convulsive	1
running	1
of	1
the	1
whale	1
upon	1
receiving	1
the	1
first	1
iron,	1
it	1
becomes	1
impossible	1
for	1
the	1
harpooneer,	1
however	1
lightning-like	1
in	1
his	1
movements,	1
to	1
pitch	1
the	1
second	1
iron	1
into	1
him.	1
Nevertheless,	1
as	1
the	1
second	1
iron	1
is	1
already	1
connected	1
with	1
the	1
line,	1
and	1
the	1
line	1
is	1
running,	1
hence	1
that	1
weapon	1
must,	1
at	1
all	1
events,	1
be	1
anticipatingly	1
tossed	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
boat,	1
somehow	1
and	1
somewhere;	1
else	1
the	1
most	1
terrible	1
jeopardy	1
would	1
involve	1
all	1
hands.	1
Tumbled	1
into	1
the	1
water,	1
it	1
accordingly	1
is	1
in	1
such	1
cases;	1
the	1
spare	1
coils	1
of	1
box	1
line	1
(mentioned	1
in	1
a	1
preceding	1
chapter)	1
making	1
this	1
feat,	1
in	1
most	1
instances,	1
prudently	1
practicable.	1
But	1
this	1
critical	1
act	1
is	1
not	1
always	1
unattended	1
with	1
the	1
saddest	1
and	1
most	1
fatal	1
casualties.	1
Furthermore:	1
you	1
must	1
know	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
second	1
iron	1
is	1
thrown	1
overboard,	1
it	1
thenceforth	1
becomes	1
a	1
dangling,	1
sharp-edged	1
terror,	1
skittishly	1
curvetting	1
about	1
both	1
boat	1
and	1
whale,	1
entangling	1
the	1
lines,	1
or	1
cutting	1
them,	1
and	1
making	1
a	1
prodigious	1
sensation	1
in	1
all	1
directions.	1
Nor,	1
in	1
general,	1
is	1
it	1
possible	1
to	1
secure	1
it	1
again	1
until	1
the	1
whale	1
is	1
fairly	1
captured	1
and	1
a	1
corpse.	1
Consider,	1
now,	1
how	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
four	1
boats	1
all	1
engaging	1
one	1
unusually	1
strong,	1
active,	1
and	1
knowing	1
whale;	1
when	1
owing	1
to	1
these	1
qualities	1
in	1
him,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
thousand	1
concurring	1
accidents	1
of	1
such	1
an	1
audacious	1
enterprise,	1
eight	1
or	1
ten	1
loose	1
second	1
irons	1
may	1
be	1
simultaneously	1
dangling	1
about	1
him.	1
For,	1
of	1
course,	1
each	1
boat	1
is	1
supplied	1
with	1
several	1
harpoons	1
to	1
bend	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
line	1
should	1
the	1
first	1
one	1
be	1
ineffectually	1
darted	1
without	1
recovery.	1
All	1
these	1
particulars	1
are	1
faithfully	1
narrated	1
here,	1
as	1
they	1
will	1
not	1
fail	1
to	1
elucidate	1
several	1
most	1
important,	1
however	1
intricate	1
passages,	1
in	1
scenes	1
hereafter	1
to	1
be	1
painted.	1
CHAPTER	1
64	1
Stubb's	1
Supper.	1
Stubb's	1
whale	1
had	1
been	1
killed	1
some	1
distance	1
from	1
the	1
ship.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
calm;	1
so,	1
forming	1
a	1
tandem	1
of	1
three	1
boats,	1
we	1
commenced	1
the	1
slow	1
business	1
of	1
towing	1
the	1
trophy	1
to	1
the	1
Pequod.	1
And	1
now,	1
as	1
we	1
eighteen	1
men	1
with	1
our	1
thirty-six	1
arms,	1
and	1
one	1
hundred	1
and	1
eighty	1
thumbs	1
and	1
fingers,	1
slowly	1
toiled	1
hour	1
after	1
hour	1
upon	1
that	1
inert,	1
sluggish	1
corpse	1
in	1
the	1
sea;	1
and	1
it	1
seemed	1
hardly	1
to	1
budge	1
at	1
all,	1
except	1
at	1
long	1
intervals;	1
good	1
evidence	1
was	1
hereby	1
furnished	1
of	1
the	1
enormousness	1
of	1
the	1
mass	1
we	1
moved.	1
For,	1
upon	1
the	1
great	1
canal	1
of	1
Hang-Ho,	1
or	1
whatever	1
they	1
call	1
it,	1
in	1
China,	1
four	1
or	1
five	1
laborers	1
on	1
the	1
foot-path	1
will	1
draw	1
a	1
bulky	1
freighted	1
junk	1
at	1
the	1
rate	1
of	1
a	1
mile	1
an	1
hour;	1
but	1
this	1
grand	1
argosy	1
we	1
towed	1
heavily	1
forged	1
along,	1
as	1
if	1
laden	1
with	1
pig-lead	1
in	1
bulk.	1
Darkness	1
came	1
on;	1
but	1
three	1
lights	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
Pequod's	1
main-rigging	1
dimly	1
guided	1
our	1
way;	1
till	1
drawing	1
nearer	1
we	1
saw	1
Ahab	1
dropping	1
one	1
of	1
several	1
more	1
lanterns	1
over	1
the	1
bulwarks.	1
Vacantly	1
eyeing	1
the	1
heaving	1
whale	1
for	1
a	1
moment,	1
he	1
issued	1
the	1
usual	1
orders	1
for	1
securing	1
it	1
for	1
the	1
night,	1
and	1
then	1
handing	1
his	1
lantern	1
to	1
a	1
seaman,	1
went	1
his	1
way	1
into	1
the	1
cabin,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
come	1
forward	1
again	1
until	1
morning.	1
Though,	1
in	1
overseeing	1
the	1
pursuit	1
of	1
this	1
whale,	1
Captain	1
Ahab	1
had	1
evinced	1
his	1
customary	1
activity,	1
to	1
call	1
it	1
so;	1
yet	1
now	1
that	1
the	1
creature	1
was	1
dead,	1
some	1
vague	1
dissatisfaction,	1
or	1
impatience,	1
or	1
despair,	1
seemed	1
working	1
in	1
him;	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
that	1
dead	1
body	1
reminded	1
him	1
that	1
Moby	1
Dick	1
was	1
yet	1
to	1
be	1
slain;	1
and	1
though	1
a	1
thousand	1
other	1
whales	1
were	1
brought	1
to	1
his	1
ship,	1
all	1
that	1
would	1
not	1
one	1
jot	1
advance	1
his	1
grand,	1
monomaniac	1
object.	1
Very	1
soon	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
thought	1
from	1
the	1
sound	1
on	1
the	1
Pequod's	1
decks,	1
that	1
all	1
hands	1
were	1
preparing	1
to	1
cast	1
anchor	1
in	1
the	1
deep;	1
for	1
heavy	1
chains	1
are	1
being	1
dragged	1
along	1
the	1
deck,	1
and	1
thrust	1
rattling	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
port-holes.	1
But	1
by	1
those	1
clanking	1
links,	1
the	1
vast	1
corpse	1
itself,	1
not	1
the	1
ship,	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
moored.	1
Tied	1
by	1
the	1
head	1
to	1
the	1
stern,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
tail	1
to	1
the	1
bows,	1
the	1
whale	1
now	1
lies	1
with	1
its	1
black	1
hull	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
vessel's	1
and	1
seen	1
through	1
the	1
darkness	1
of	1
the	1
night,	1
which	1
obscured	1
the	1
spars	1
and	1
rigging	1
aloft,	1
the	1
two--ship	1
and	1
whale,	1
seemed	1
yoked	1
together	1
like	1
colossal	1
bullocks,	1
whereof	1
one	1
reclines	1
while	1
the	1
other	1
remains	1
standing.*	1
*A	1
little	1
item	1
may	1
as	1
well	1
be	1
related	1
here.	1
The	1
strongest	1
and	1
most	1
reliable	1
hold	1
which	1
the	1
ship	1
has	1
upon	1
the	1
whale	1
when	1
moored	1
alongside,	1
is	1
by	1
the	1
flukes	1
or	1
tail;	1
and	1
as	1
from	1
its	1
greater	1
density	1
that	1
part	1
is	1
relatively	1
heavier	1
than	1
any	1
other	1
(excepting	1
the	1
side-fins),	1
its	1
flexibility	1
even	1
in	1
death,	1
causes	1
it	1
to	1
sink	1
low	1
beneath	1
the	1
surface;	1
so	1
that	1
with	1
the	1
hand	1
you	1
cannot	1
get	1
at	1
it	1
from	1
the	1
boat,	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
put	1
the	1
chain	1
round	1
it.	1
But	1
this	1
difficulty	1
is	1
ingeniously	1
overcome:	1
a	1
small,	1
strong	1
line	1
is	1
prepared	1
with	1
a	1
wooden	1
float	1
at	1
its	1
outer	1
end,	1
and	1
a	1
weight	1
in	1
its	1
middle,	1
while	1
the	1
other	1
end	1
is	1
secured	1
to	1
the	1
ship.	1
By	1
adroit	1
management	1
the	1
wooden	1
float	1
is	1
made	1
to	1
rise	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
mass,	1
so	1
that	1
now	1
having	1
girdled	1
the	1
whale,	1
the	1
chain	1
is	1
readily	1
made	1
to	1
follow	1
suit;	1
and	1
being	1
slipped	1
along	1
the	1
body,	1
is	1
at	1
last	1
locked	1
fast	1
round	1
the	1
smallest	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
tail,	1
at	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
junction	1
with	1
its	1
broad	1
flukes	1
or	1
lobes.	1
If	1
moody	1
Ahab	1
was	1
now	1
all	1
quiescence,	1
at	1
least	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
could	1
be	1
known	1
on	1
deck,	1
Stubb,	1
his	1
second	1
mate,	1
flushed	1
with	1
conquest,	1
betrayed	1
an	1
unusual	1
but	1
still	1
good-natured	1
excitement.	1
Such	1
an	1
unwonted	1
bustle	1
was	1
he	1
in	1
that	1
the	1
staid	1
Starbuck,	1
his	1
official	1
superior,	1
quietly	1
resigned	1
to	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
the	1
sole	1
management	1
of	1
affairs.	1
One	1
small,	1
helping	1
cause	1
of	1
all	1
this	1
liveliness	1
in	1
Stubb,	1
was	1
soon	1
made	1
strangely	1
manifest.	1
Stubb	1
was	1
a	1
high	1
liver;	1
he	1
was	1
somewhat	1
intemperately	1
fond	1
of	1
the	1
whale	1
as	1
a	1
flavorish	1
thing	1
to	1
his	1
palate.	1
"A	1
steak,	1
a	1
steak,	1
ere	1
I	1
sleep!	1
You,	1
Daggoo!	1
overboard	1
you	1
go,	1
and	1
cut	1
me	1
one	1
from	1
his	1
small!"	1
Here	1
be	1
it	1
known,	1
that	1
though	1
these	1
wild	1
fishermen	1
do	1
not,	1
as	1
a	1
general	1
thing,	1
and	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
great	1
military	1
maxim,	1
make	1
the	1
enemy	1
defray	1
the	1
current	1
expenses	1
of	1
the	1
war	1
(at	1
least	1
before	1
realizing	1
the	1
proceeds	1
of	1
the	1
voyage),	1
yet	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
you	1
find	1
some	1
of	1
these	1
Nantucketers	1
who	1
have	1
a	1
genuine	1
relish	1
for	1
that	1
particular	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
Sperm	1
Whale	1
designated	1
by	1
Stubb;	1
comprising	1
the	1
tapering	1
extremity	1
of	1
the	1
body.	1
About	1
midnight	1
that	1
steak	1
was	1
cut	1
and	1
cooked;	1
and	1
lighted	1
by	1
two	1
lanterns	1
of	1
sperm	1
oil,	1
Stubb	1
stoutly	1
stood	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
spermaceti	1
supper	1
at	1
the	1
capstan-head,	1
as	1
if	1
that	1
capstan	1
were	1
a	1
sideboard.	1
Nor	1
was	1
Stubb	1
the	1
only	1
banqueter	1
on	1
whale's	1
flesh	1
that	1
night.	1
Mingling	1
their	1
mumblings	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
mastications,	1
thousands	1
on	1
thousands	1
of	1
sharks,	1
swarming	1
round	1
the	1
dead	1
leviathan,	1
smackingly	1
feasted	1
on	1
its	1
fatness.	1
The	1
few	1
sleepers	1
below	1
in	1
their	1
bunks	1
were	1
often	1
startled	1
by	1
the	1
sharp	1
slapping	1
of	1
their	1
tails	1
against	1
the	1
hull,	1
within	1
a	1
few	1
inches	1
of	1
the	1
sleepers'	1
hearts.	1
Peering	1
over	1
the	1
side	1
you	1
could	1
just	1
see	1
them	1
(as	1
before	1
you	1
heard	1
them)	1
wallowing	1
in	1
the	1
sullen,	1
black	1
waters,	1
and	1
turning	1
over	1
on	1
their	1
backs	1
as	1
they	1
scooped	1
out	1
huge	1
globular	1
pieces	1
of	1
the	1
whale	1
of	1
the	1
bigness	1
of	1
a	1
human	1
head.	1
This	1
particular	1
feat	1
of	1
the	1
shark	1
seems	1
all	1
but	1
miraculous.	1
How	1
at	1
such	1
an	1
apparently	1
unassailable	1
surface,	1
they	1
contrive	1
to	1
gouge	1
out	1
such	1
symmetrical	1
mouthfuls,	1
remains	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
universal	1
problem	1
of	1
all	1
things.	1
The	1
mark	1
they	1
thus	1
leave	1
on	1
the	1
whale,	1
may	1
best	1
be	1
likened	1
to	1
the	1
hollow	1
made	1
by	1
a	1
carpenter	1
in	1
countersinking	1
for	1
a	1
screw.	1
Though	1
amid	1
all	1
the	1
smoking	1
horror	1
and	1
diabolism	1
of	1
a	1
sea-fight,	1
sharks	1
will	1
be	1
seen	1
longingly	1
gazing	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
ship's	1
decks,	1
like	1
hungry	1
dogs	1
round	1
a	1
table	1
where	1
red	1
meat	1
is	1
being	1
carved,	1
ready	1
to	1
bolt	1
down	1
every	1
killed	1
man	1
that	1
is	1
tossed	1
to	1
them;	1
and	1
though,	1
while	1
the	1
valiant	1
butchers	1
over	1
the	1
deck-table	1
are	1
thus	1
cannibally	1
carving	1
each	1
other's	1
live	1
meat	1
with	1
carving-knives	1
all	1
gilded	1
and	1
tasselled,	1
the	1
sharks,	1
also,	1
with	1
their	1
jewel-hilted	1
mouths,	1
are	1
quarrelsomely	1
carving	1
away	1
under	1
the	1
table	1
at	1
the	1
dead	1
meat;	1
and	1
though,	1
were	1
you	1
to	1
turn	1
the	1
whole	1
affair	1
upside	1
down,	1
it	1
would	1
still	1
be	1
pretty	1
much	1
the	1
same	1
thing,	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
a	1
shocking	1
sharkish	1
business	1
enough	1
for	1
all	1
parties;	1
and	1
though	1
sharks	1
also	1
are	1
the	1
invariable	1
outriders	1
of	1
all	1
slave	1
ships	1
crossing	1
the	1
Atlantic,	1
systematically	1
trotting	1
alongside,	1
to	1
be	1
handy	1
in	1
case	1
a	1
parcel	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
carried	1
anywhere,	1
or	1
a	1
dead	1
slave	1
to	1
be	1
decently	1
buried;	1
and	1
though	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
other	1
like	1
instances	1
might	1
be	1
set	1
down,	1
touching	1
the	1
set	1
terms,	1
places,	1
and	1
occasions,	1
when	1
sharks	1
do	1
most	1
socially	1
congregate,	1
and	1
most	1
hilariously	1
feast;	1
yet	1
is	1
there	1
no	1
conceivable	1
time	1
or	1
occasion	1
when	1
you	1
will	1
find	1
them	1
in	1
such	1
countless	1
numbers,	1
and	1
in	1
gayer	1
or	1
more	1
jovial	1
spirits,	1
than	1
around	1
a	1
dead	1
sperm	1
whale,	1
moored	1
by	1
night	1
to	1
a	1
whaleship	1
at	1
sea.	1
If	1
you	1
have	1
never	1
seen	1
that	1
sight,	1
then	1
suspend	1
your	1
decision	1
about	1
the	1
propriety	1
of	1
devil-worship,	1
and	1
the	1
expediency	1
of	1
conciliating	1
the	1
devil.	1
But,	1
as	1
yet,	1
Stubb	1
heeded	1
not	1
the	1
mumblings	1
of	1
the	1
banquet	1
that	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
so	1
nigh	1
him,	1
no	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
sharks	1
heeded	1
the	1
smacking	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
epicurean	1
lips.	1
"Cook,	1
cook!--where's	1
that	1
old	1
Fleece?"	1
he	1
cried	1
at	1
length,	1
widening	1
his	1
legs	1
still	1
further,	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
form	1
a	1
more	1
secure	1
base	1
for	1
his	1
supper;	1
and,	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
darting	1
his	1
fork	1
into	1
the	1
dish,	1
as	1
if	1
stabbing	1
with	1
his	1
lance;	1
"cook,	1
you	1
cook!--sail	1
this	1
way,	1
cook!"	1
The	1
old	1
black,	1
not	1
in	1
any	1
very	1
high	1
glee	1
at	1
having	1
been	1
previously	1
roused	1
from	1
his	1
warm	1
hammock	1
at	1
a	1
most	1
unseasonable	1
hour,	1
came	1
shambling	1
along	1
from	1
his	1
galley,	1
for,	1
like	1
many	1
old	1
blacks,	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
his	1
knee-pans,	1
which	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
keep	1
well	1
scoured	1
like	1
his	1
other	1
pans;	1
this	1
old	1
Fleece,	1
as	1
they	1
called	1
him,	1
came	1
shuffling	1
and	1
limping	1
along,	1
assisting	1
his	1
step	1
with	1
his	1
tongs,	1
which,	1
after	1
a	1
clumsy	1
fashion,	1
were	1
made	1
of	1
straightened	1
iron	1
hoops;	1
this	1
old	1
Ebony	1
floundered	1
along,	1
and	1
in	1
obedience	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
command,	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
dead	1
stop	1
on	1
the	1
opposite	1
side	1
of	1
Stubb's	1
sideboard;	1
when,	1
with	1
both	1
hands	1
folded	1
before	1
him,	1
and	1
resting	1
on	1
his	1
two-legged	1
cane,	1
he	1
bowed	1
his	1
arched	1
back	1
still	1
further	1
over,	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
sideways	1
inclining	1
his	1
head,	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
bring	1
his	1
best	1
ear	1
into	1
play.	1
"Cook,"	1
said	1
Stubb,	1
rapidly	1
lifting	1
a	1
rather	1
reddish	1
morsel	1
to	1
his	1
mouth,	1
"don't	1
you	1
think	1
this	1
steak	1
is	1
rather	1
overdone?	1
You've	1
been	1
beating	1
this	1
steak	1
too	1
much,	1
cook;	1
it's	1
too	1
tender.	1
Don't	1
I	1
always	1
say	1
that	1
to	1
be	1
good,	1
a	1
whale-steak	1
must	1
be	1
tough?	1
There	1
are	1
those	1
sharks	1
now	1
over	1
the	1
side,	1
don't	1
you	1
see	1
they	1
prefer	1
it	1
tough	1
and	1
rare?	1
What	1
a	1
shindy	1
they	1
are	1
kicking	1
up!	1
Cook,	1
go	1
and	1
talk	1
to	1
'em;	1
tell	1
'em	1
they	1
are	1
welcome	1
to	1
help	1
themselves	1
civilly,	1
and	1
in	1
moderation,	1
but	1
they	1
must	1
keep	1
quiet.	1
Blast	1
me,	1
if	1
I	1
can	1
hear	1
my	1
own	1
voice.	1
Away,	1
cook,	1
and	1
deliver	1
my	1
message.	1
Here,	1
take	1
this	1
lantern,"	1
snatching	1
one	1
from	1
his	1
sideboard;	1
"now	1
then,	1
go	1
and	1
preach	1
to	1
'em!"	1
Sullenly	1
taking	1
the	1
offered	1
lantern,	1
old	1
Fleece	1
limped	1
across	1
the	1
deck	1
to	1
the	1
bulwarks;	1
and	1
then,	1
with	1
one	1
hand	1
dropping	1
his	1
light	1
low	1
over	1
the	1
sea,	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
good	1
view	1
of	1
his	1
congregation,	1
with	1
the	1
other	1
hand	1
he	1
solemnly	1
flourished	1
his	1
tongs,	1
and	1
leaning	1
far	1
over	1
the	1
side	1
in	1
a	1
mumbling	1
voice	1
began	1
addressing	1
the	1
sharks,	1
while	1
Stubb,	1
softly	1
crawling	1
behind,	1
overheard	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
said.	1
"Fellow-critters:	1
I'se	1
ordered	1
here	1
to	1
say	1
dat	1
you	1
must	1
stop	1
dat	1
dam	1
noise	1
dare.	1
You	1
hear?	1
Stop	1
dat	1
dam	1
smackin'	1
ob	1
de	1
lips!	1
Massa	1
Stubb	1
say	1
dat	1
you	1
can	1
fill	1
your	1
dam	1
bellies	1
up	1
to	1
de	1
hatchings,	1
but	1
by	1
Gor!	1
you	1
must	1
stop	1
dat	1
dam	1
racket!"	1
"Cook,"	1
here	1
interposed	1
Stubb,	1
accompanying	1
the	1
word	1
with	1
a	1
sudden	1
slap	1
on	1
the	1
shoulder,--"Cook!	1
why,	1
damn	1
your	1
eyes,	1
you	1
mustn't	1
swear	1
that	1
way	1
when	1
you're	1
preaching.	1
That's	1
no	1
way	1
to	1
convert	1
sinners,	1
cook!"	1
"Who	1
dat?	1
Den	1
preach	1
to	1
him	1
yourself,"	1
sullenly	1
turning	1
to	1
go.	1
"No,	1
cook;	1
go	1
on,	1
go	1
on."	1
"Well,	1
den,	1
Belubed	1
fellow-critters:"-	1
"Right!"	1
exclaimed	1
Stubb,	1
approvingly,	1
"coax	1
'em	1
to	1
it;	1
try	1
that,"	1
and	1
Fleece	1
continued.	1
"Do	1
you	1
is	1
all	1
sharks,	1
and	1
by	1
natur	1
wery	1
woracious,	1
yet	1
I	1
zay	1
to	1
you,	1
fellow-critters,	1
dat	1
dat	1
woraciousness--'top	1
dat	1
dam	1
slappin'	1
ob	1
de	1

How	1
you	1
tink	1
to	1
hear,	1
spose	1
you	1
keep	1
up	1
such	1
a	1
dam	1
slappin'	1
and	1
bitin'	1
dare?"	1
"Cook,"	1
cried	1
Stubb,	1
collaring	1
him,	1
"I	1
won't	1
have	1
that	1
swearing.	1
Talk	1
to	1
'em	1
gentlemanly."	1
Once	1
more	1
the	1
sermon	1
proceeded.	1
"Your	1
woraciousness,	1
fellow-critters,	1
I	1
don't	1
blame	1
ye	1
so	1
much	1
for;	1
dat	1

You	1

but	1
if	1

for	1
all	1

not'ing	1

Now,	1

Don't	1

I	1
say.	1
Is	1
not	1

And,	1
by	1

"Well	1
done,	1

Fleece!"	1
cried	1
Stubb,	1
"that's	1
Christianity;	1
go	1
on."	1
"No	1

and	1
can't	1
hear	1
noting	1
at	1
all,	1
no	1
more,	1
for	1
eber	1
and	1
eber."	1
"Upon	1
my	1
soul,	1
I	1
am	1
about	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
opinion;	1
so	1
give	1
the	1
benediction,	1
Fleece,	1
and	1
I'll	1
away	1
to	1
my	1
supper."	1
Upon	1
this,	1
Fleece,	1
holding	1
both	1
hands	1
over	1
the	1
fishy	1
mob,	1
raised	1
his	1
shrill	1
voice,	1
and	1
cried--	1
"Cussed	1
fellow-critters!	1
Kick	1
up	1
de	1
damndest	1
row	1
as	1
ever	1
you	1
can;	1
fill	1
your	1
dam	1
bellies	1
'till	1
dey	1
bust--and	1
den	1
die."	1
"Now,	1
cook,"	1
said	1
Stubb,	1
resuming	1
his	1
supper	1
at	1
the	1
capstan;	1
"stand	1
just	1
where	1
you	1
stood	1
before,	1
there,	1
over	1
against	1
me,	1
and	1
pay	1
particular	1
attention."	1
"All	1
'dention,"	1
said	1
Fleece,	1
again	1
stooping	1
over	1
upon	1
his	1
tongs	1
in	1
the	1
desired	1
position.	1
"Well,"	1
said	1
Stubb,	1
helping	1
himself	1
freely	1
meanwhile;	1
"I	1
shall	1
now	1
go	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
this	1
steak.	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
place,	1
how	1
old	1
are	1
you,	1
cook?"	1
"What	1
dat	1
do	1
wid	1
de	1
'teak,"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
black,	1
testily.	1
"Silence!	1
How	1
old	1
are	1
you,	1
cook?"	1
"'Bout	1
ninety,	1
dey	1
say,"	1
he	1
gloomily	1
muttered.	1
"And	1
you	1
have	1
lived	1
in	1
this	1
world	1
hard	1
upon	1
one	1
hundred	1
years,	1
cook,	1
and	1
don't	1
know	1
yet	1
how	1
to	1
cook	1
a	1
whale-steak?"	1
rapidly	1
bolting	1
another	1
mouthful	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
word,	1
so	1
that	1
morsel	1
seemed	1
a	1
continuation	1
of	1
the	1
question.	1
"Where	1
were	1
you	1
born,	1
cook?"	1
"'Hind	1
de	1
hatchway,	1
in	1
ferry-boat,	1
goin'	1
ober	1
de	1
Roanoke."	1
"Born	1
in	1
a	1
ferry-boat!	1
That's	1
queer,	1
too.	1
But	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
country	1
you	1
were	1
born	1
in,	1
cook!"	1
"Didn't	1
I	1
say	1
de	1
Roanoke	1
country?"	1
he	1
cried	1
sharply.	1
"No,	1
you	1
didn't,	1
cook;	1
but	1
I'll	1
tell	1
you	1
what	1
I'm	1
coming	1
to,	1
cook.	1
You	1
must	1
go	1
home	1
and	1
be	1
born	1
over	1
again;	1
you	1
don't	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
cook	1
a	1
whale-steak	1
yet."	1
"Bress	1
my	1
soul,	1
if	1
I	1
cook	1
noder	1
one,"	1
he	1
growled,	1
angrily,	1
turning	1
round	1
to	1
depart.	1
"Come	1
back	1
here,	1
cook;--here,	1
hand	1
me	1
those	1
tongs;--now	1
take	1
that	1
bit	1
of	1
steak	1
there,	1
and	1
tell	1
me	1
if	1
you	1
think	1
that	1
steak	1
cooked	1
as	1
it	1
should	1
be?	1
Take	1
it,	1
I	1
say"--holding	1
the	1
tongs	1
towards	1
him--"take	1
it,	1
and	1
taste	1
it."	1
Faintly	1
smacking	1
his	1
withered	1
lips	1
over	1
it	1
for	1
a	1
moment,	1
the	1
old	1
negro	1
muttered,	1
"Best	1
cooked	1
'teak	1
I	1
eber	1
taste;	1
joosy,	1
berry	1
joosy."	1
"Cook,"	1
said	1
Stubb,	1
squaring	1
himself	1
once	1
more;	1
"do	1
you	1
belong	1
to	1
the	1
church?"	1
"Passed	1
one	1
once	1
in	1
Cape-Down,"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
sullenly.	1
"And	1
you	1
have	1
once	1
in	1
your	1
life	1
passed	1
a	1
holy	1
church	1
in	1
Cape-Town,	1
where	1
you	1
doubtless	1
overheard	1
a	1
holy	1
parson	1
addressing	1
his	1
hearers	1
as	1
his	1
beloved	1
fellow-creatures,	1
have	1
you,	1
cook!	1
And	1
yet	1
you	1
come	1
here,	1
and	1
tell	1
me	1
such	1
a	1
dreadful	1
lie	1
as	1
you	1
did	1
just	1
now,	1
eh?"	1
said	1
Stubb.	1
"Where	1
do	1
you	1
expect	1
to	1
go	1
to,	1
cook?"	1
"Go	1
to	1
bed	1
berry	1
soon,"	1
he	1
mumbled,	1
half-turning	1
as	1
he	1
spoke.	1
"Avast!	1
heave	1
to!	1
I	1
mean	1
when	1
you	1
die,	1
cook.	1
It's	1
an	1
awful	1
question.	1
Now	1
what's	1
your	1
answer?"	1
"When	1
dis	1
old	1
brack	1
man	1
dies,"	1
said	1
the	1
negro	1
slowly,	1
changing	1
his	1
whole	1
air	1
and	1
demeanor,	1
"he	1
hisself	1
won't	1
go	1
nowhere;	1
but	1
some	1
bressed	1
angel	1
will	1
come	1
and	1
fetch	1
him."	1
"Fetch	1
him?	1
How?	1
In	1
a	1
coach	1
and	1
four,	1
as	1
they	1
fetched	1
Elijah?	1
And	1
fetch	1
him	1
where?"	1
"Up	1
dere,"	1
said	1
Fleece,	1
holding	1
his	1
tongs	1
straight	1
over	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
keeping	1
it	1
there	1
very	1
solemnly.	1
"So,	1
then,	1
you	1
expect	1
to	1
go	1
up	1
into	1
our	1
main-top,	1
do	1
you,	1
cook,	1
when	1
you	1
are	1
dead?	1
But	1
don't	1
you	1
know	1
the	1
higher	1
you	1
climb,	1
the	1
colder	1
it	1
gets?	1
Main-top,	1
eh?"	1
"Didn't	1
say	1
dat	1
t'all,"	1
said	1
Fleece,	1
again	1
in	1
the	1
sulks.	1
"You	1
said	1
up	1
there,	1
didn't	1
you?	1
and	1
now	1
look	1
yourself,	1
and	1
see	1
where	1
your	1
tongs	1
are	1
pointing.	1
But,	1
perhaps	1
you	1
expect	1
to	1
get	1
into	1
heaven	1
by	1
crawling	1
through	1
the	1
lubber's	1
hole,	1
cook;	1
but,	1
no,	1
no,	1
cook,	1
you	1
don't	1
get	1
there,	1
except	1
you	1
go	1
the	1
regular	1
way,	1
round	1
by	1
the	1
rigging.	1
It's	1
a	1
ticklish	1
business,	1
but	1
must	1
be	1
done,	1
or	1
else	1
it's	1
no	1
go.	1
But	1
none	1
of	1
us	1
are	1
in	1
heaven	1
yet.	1
Drop	1
your	1
tongs,	1
cook,	1
and	1
hear	1
my	1
orders.	1
Do	1
ye	1
hear?	1
Hold	1
your	1
hat	1
in	1
one	1
hand,	1
and	1
clap	1
t'other	1
a'top	1
of	1
your	1
heart,	1
when	1
I'm	1
giving	1
my	1
orders,	1
cook.	1
What!	1
that	1
your	1
heart,	1
there?--that's	1
your	1
gizzard!	1
Aloft!	1
aloft!--that's	1
it--now	1
you	1
have	1
it.	1
Hold	1
it	1
there	1
now,	1
and	1
pay	1
attention."	1
"All	1
'dention,"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
black,	1
with	1
both	1
hands	1
placed	1
as	1
desired,	1
vainly	1
wriggling	1
his	1
grizzled	1
head,	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
get	1
both	1
ears	1
in	1
front	1
at	1
one	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
time.	1
"Well	1
then,	1
cook,	1
you	1
see	1
this	1
whale-steak	1
of	1
yours	1
was	1
so	1
very	1
bad,	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
put	1
it	1
out	1
of	1
sight	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
possible;	1
you	1
see	1
that,	1
don't	1
you?	1
Well,	1
for	1
the	1
future,	1
when	1
you	1
cook	1
another	1
whale-steak	1
for	1
my	1
private	1
table	1
here,	1
the	1
capstan,	1
I'll	1
tell	1
you	1
what	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
spoil	1
it	1
by	1
overdoing.	1
Hold	1
the	1
steak	1
in	1
one	1
hand,	1
and	1
show	1
a	1
live	1
coal	1
to	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
other;	1
that	1
done,	1
dish	1
it;	1
d'ye	1
hear?	1
And	1
now	1
to-morrow,	1
cook,	1
when	1
we	1
are	1
cutting	1
in	1
the	1
fish,	1
be	1
sure	1
you	1
stand	1
by	1
to	1
get	1
the	1
tips	1
of	1
his	1
fins;	1
have	1
them	1
put	1
in	1
pickle.	1
As	1
for	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
flukes,	1
have	1
them	1
soused,	1
cook.	1
There,	1
now	1
ye	1
may	1
go."	1
But	1
Fleece	1
had	1
hardly	1
got	1
three	1
paces	1
off,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
recalled.	1
"Cook,	1
give	1
me	1
cutlets	1
for	1
supper	1
to-morrow	1
night	1
in	1
the	1
mid-watch.	1
D'ye	1
hear?	1
away	1
you	1
sail,	1
then.--Halloa!	1
stop!	1
make	1
a	1
bow	1
before	1
you	1
go.--Avast	1
heaving	1
again!	1
Whale-balls	1
for	1
breakfast--don't	1
forget."	1
"Wish,	1
by	1
gor!	1
whale	1
eat	1
him,	1
'stead	1
of	1
him	1
eat	1
whale.	1
I'm	1
bressed	1
if	1
he	1
ain't	1
more	1
of	1
shark	1
dan	1
Massa	1
Shark	1
hisself,"	1
muttered	1
the	1
old	1
man,	1
limping	1
away;	1
with	1
which	1
sage	1
ejaculation	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
his	1
hammock.	1
CHAPTER	1
65	1
The	1
Whale	1
as	1
a	1
Dish.	1
That	1
mortal	1
man	1
should	1
feed	1
upon	1
the	1
creature	1
that	1
feeds	1
his	1
lamp,	1
and,	1
like	1
Stubb,	1
eat	1
him	1
by	1
his	1
own	1
light,	1
as	1
you	1
may	1
say;	1
this	1
seems	1
so	1
outlandish	1
a	1
thing	1
that	1
one	1
must	1
needs	1
go	1
a	1
little	1
into	1
the	1
history	1
and	1
philosophy	1
of	1
it.	1
It	1
is	1
upon	1
record,	1
that	1
three	1
centuries	1
ago	1
the	1
tongue	1
of	1
the	1
Right	1
Whale	1
was	1
esteemed	1
a	1
great	1
delicacy	1
in	1
France,	1
and	1
commanded	1
large	1
prices	1
there.	1
Also,	1
that	1
in	1
Henry	1
VIIIth's	1
time,	1
a	1
certain	1
cook	1
of	1
the	1
court	1
obtained	1
a	1
handsome	1
reward	1
for	1
inventing	1
an	1
admirable	1
sauce	1
to	1
be	1
eaten	1
with	1
barbacued	1
porpoises,	1
which,	1
you	1
remember,	1
are	1
a	1
species	1
of	1
whale.	1
Porpoises,	1
indeed,	1
are	1
to	1
this	1
day	1
considered	1
fine	1
eating.	1
The	1
meat	1
is	1
made	1
into	1
balls	1
about	1
the	1
size	1
of	1
billiard	1
balls,	1
and	1
being	1
well	1
seasoned	1
and	1
spiced	1
might	1
be	1
taken	1
for	1
turtle-balls	1
or	1
veal	1
balls.	1
The	1
old	1
monks	1
of	1
Dunfermline	1
were	1
very	1
fond	1
of	1
them.	1
They	1
had	1
a	1
great	1
porpoise	1
grant	1
from	1
the	1
crown.	1
The	1
fact	1
is,	1
that	1
among	1
his	1
hunters	1
at	1
least,	1
the	1
whale	1
would	1
by	1
all	1
hands	1
be	1
considered	1
a	1
noble	1
dish,	1
were	1
there	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
of	1
him;	1
but	1
when	1
you	1
come	1
to	1
sit	1
down	1
before	1
a	1
meat-pie	1
nearly	1
one	1
hundred	1
feet	1
long,	1
it	1
takes	1
away	1
your	1
appetite.	1
Only	1
the	1
most	1
unprejudiced	1
of	1
men	1
like	1
Stubb,	1
nowadays	1
partake	1
of	1
cooked	1
whales;	1
but	1
the	1
Esquimaux	1
are	1
not	1
so	1
fastidious.	1
We	1
all	1
know	1
how	1
they	1
live	1
upon	1
whales,	1
and	1
have	1
rare	1
old	1
vintages	1
of	1
prime	1
old	1
train	1
oil.	1
Zogranda,	1
one	1
of	1
their	1
most	1
famous	1
doctors,	1
recommends	1
strips	1
of	1
blubber	1
for	1
infants,	1
as	1
being	1
exceedingly	1
juicy	1
and	1
nourishing.	1
And	1
this	1
reminds	1
me	1
that	1
certain	1
Englishmen,	1
who	1
long	1
ago	1
were	1
accidentally	1
left	1
in	1
Greenland	1
by	1
a	1
whaling	1
vessel--that	1
these	1
men	1
actually	1
lived	1
for	1
several	1
months	1
on	1
the	1
mouldy	1
scraps	1
of	1
whales	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
left	1
ashore	1
after	1
trying	1
out	1
the	1
blubber.	1
Among	1
the	1
Dutch	1
whalemen	1
these	1
scraps	1
are	1
called	1
"fritters";	1
which,	1
indeed,	1
they	1
greatly	1
resemble,	1
being	1
brown	1
and	1
crisp,	1
and	1
smelling	1
something	1
like	1
old	1
Amsterdam	1
housewives'	1
dough-nuts	1
or	1
oly-cooks,	1
when	1
fresh.	1
They	1
have	1
such	1
an	1
eatable	1
look	1
that	1
the	1
most	1
self-denying	1
stranger	1
can	1
hardly	1
keep	1
his	1
hands	1
off.	1
But	1
what	1
further	1
depreciates	1
the	1
whale	1
as	1
a	1
civilized	1
dish,	1
is	1
his	1
exceeding	1
richness.	1
He	1
is	1
the	1
great	1
prize	1
ox	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
too	1
fat	1
to	1
be	1
delicately	1
good.	1
Look	1
at	1
his	1
hump,	1
which	1
would	1
be	1
as	1
fine	1
eating	1
as	1
the	1
buffalo's	1
(which	1
is	1
esteemed	1
a	1
rare	1
dish),	1
were	1
it	1
not	1
such	1
a	1
solid	1
pyramid	1
of	1
fat.	1
But	1
the	1
spermaceti	1
itself,	1
how	1
bland	1
and	1
creamy	1
that	1
is;	1
like	1
the	1
transparent,	1
half-jellied,	1
white	1
meat	1
of	1
a	1
cocoanut	1
in	1
the	1
third	1
month	1
of	1
its	1
growth,	1
yet	1
far	1
too	1
rich	1
to	1
supply	1
a	1
substitute	1
for	1
butter.	1
Nevertheless,	1
many	1
whalemen	1
have	1
a	1
method	1
of	1
absorbing	1
it	1
into	1
some	1
other	1
substance,	1
and	1
then	1
partaking	1
of	1
it.	1
In	1
the	1
long	1
try	1
watches	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
common	1
thing	1
for	1
the	1
seamen	1
to	1
dip	1
their	1
ship-biscuit	1
into	1
the	1
huge	1
oil-pots	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
fry	1
there	1
awhile.	1
Many	1
a	1
good	1
supper	1
have	1
I	1
thus	1
made.	1
In	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
a	1
small	1
Sperm	1
Whale	1
the	1
brains	1
are	1
accounted	1
a	1
fine	1
dish.	1
The	1
casket	1
of	1
the	1
skull	1
is	1
broken	1
into	1
with	1
an	1
axe,	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
plump,	1
whitish	1
lobes	1
being	1
withdrawn	1
(precisely	1
resembling	1
two	1
large	1
puddings),	1
they	1
are	1
then	1
mixed	1
with	1
flour,	1
and	1
cooked	1
into	1
a	1
most	1
delectable	1
mess,	1
in	1
flavor	1
somewhat	1
resembling	1
calves'	1
head,	1
which	1
is	1
quite	1
a	1
dish	1
among	1
some	1
epicures;	1
and	1
every	1
one	1
knows	1
that	1
some	1
young	1
bucks	1
among	1
the	1
epicures,	1
by	1
continually	1
dining	1
upon	1
calves'	1
brains,	1
by	1
and	1
by	1
get	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
little	1
brains	1
of	1
their	1
own,	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
tell	1
a	1
calf's	1
head	1
from	1
their	1
own	1
heads;	1
which,	1
indeed,	1
requires	1
uncommon	1
discrimination.	1
And	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
reason	1
why	1
a	1
young	1
buck	1
with	1
an	1
intelligent	1
looking	1
calf's	1
head	1
before	1
him,	1
is	1
somehow	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
saddest	1
sights	1
you	1
can	1
see.	1
The	1
head	1
looks	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
reproachfully	1
at	1
him,	1
with	1
an	1
"Et	1
tu	1
Brute!"	1
expression.	1
It	1
is	1
not,	1
perhaps,	1
entirely	1
because	1
the	1
whale	1
is	1
so	1
excessively	1
unctuous	1
that	1
landsmen	1
seem	1
to	1
regard	1
the	1
eating	1
of	1
him	1
with	1
abhorrence;	1
that	1
appears	1
to	1
result,	1
in	1
some	1
way,	1
from	1
the	1
consideration	1
before	1
mentioned:	1
i.e.	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
should	1
eat	1
a	1
newly	1
murdered	1
thing	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
eat	1
it	1
too	1
by	1
its	1
own	1
light.	1
But	1
no	1
doubt	1
the	1
first	1
man	1
that	1
ever	1
murdered	1
an	1
ox	1
was	1
regarded	1
as	1
a	1
murderer;	1
perhaps	1
he	1
was	1
hung;	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
put	1
on	1
his	1
trial	1
by	1
oxen,	1
he	1
certainly	1
would	1
have	1
been;	1
and	1
he	1
certainly	1
deserved	1
it	1
if	1
any	1
murderer	1
does.	1
Go	1
to	1
the	1
meat-market	1
of	1
a	1
Saturday	1
night	1
and	1
see	1
the	1
crowds	1
of	1
live	1
bipeds	1
staring	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
long	1
rows	1
of	1
dead	1
quadrupeds.	1
Does	1
not	1
that	1
sight	1
take	1
a	1
tooth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
cannibal's	1
jaw?	1
Cannibals?	1
who	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
cannibal?	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
more	1
tolerable	1
for	1
the	1
Fejee	1
that	1
salted	1
down	1
a	1
lean	1
missionary	1
in	1
his	1
cellar	1
against	1
a	1
coming	1
famine;	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
more	1
tolerable	1
for	1
that	1
provident	1
Fejee,	1
I	1
say,	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
judgment,	1
than	1
for	1
thee,	1
civilized	1
and	1
enlightened	1
gourmand,	1
who	1
nailest	1
geese	1
to	1
the	1
ground	1
and	1
feastest	1
on	1
their	1
bloated	1
livers	1
in	1
thy	1
pate-de-foie-gras.	1
But	1
Stubb,	1
he	1
eats	1
the	1
whale	1
by	1
its	1
own	1
light,	1
does	1
he?	1
and	1
that	1
is	1
adding	1
insult	1
to	1
injury,	1
is	1
it?	1
Look	1
at	1
your	1
knife-handle,	1
there,	1
my	1
civilized	1
and	1
enlightened	1
gourmand	1
dining	1
off	1
that	1
roast	1
beef,	1
what	1
is	1
that	1
handle	1
made	1
of?--what	1
but	1
the	1
bones	1
of	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
the	1
very	1
ox	1
you	1
are	1
eating?	1
And	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
pick	1
your	1
teeth	1
with,	1
after	1
devouring	1
that	1
fat	1
goose?	1
With	1
a	1
feather	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
fowl.	1
And	1
with	1
what	1
quill	1
did	1
the	1
Secretary	1
of	1
the	1
Society	1
for	1
the	1
Suppression	1
of	1
Cruelty	1
to	1
Ganders	1
formally	1
indite	1
his	1
circulars?	1
It	1
is	1
only	1
within	1
the	1
last	1
month	1
or	1
two	1
that	1
that	1
society	1
passed	1
a	1
resolution	1
to	1
patronise	1
nothing	1
but	1
steel	1
pens.	1
CHAPTER	1
66	1
The	1
Shark	1
Massacre.	1
When	1
in	1
the	1
Southern	1
Fishery,	1
a	1
captured	1
Sperm	1
Whale,	1
after	1
long	1
and	1
weary	1
toil,	1
is	1
brought	1
alongside	1
late	1
at	1
night,	1
it	1
is	1
not,	1
as	1
a	1
general	1
thing	1
at	1
least,	1
customary	1
to	1
proceed	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
the	1
business	1
of	1
cutting	1
him	1
in.	1
For	1
that	1
business	1
is	1
an	1
exceedingly	1
laborious	1
one;	1
is	1
not	1
very	1
soon	1
completed;	1
and	1
requires	1
all	1
hands	1
to	1
set	1
about	1
it.	1
Therefore,	1
the	1
common	1
usage	1
is	1
to	1
take	1
in	1
all	1
sail;	1
lash	1
the	1
helm	1
a'lee;	1
and	1
then	1
send	1
every	1
one	1
below	1
to	1
his	1
hammock	1
till	1
daylight,	1
with	1
the	1
reservation	1
that,	1
until	1
that	1
time,	1
anchor-watches	1
shall	1
be	1
kept;	1
that	1
is,	1
two	1
and	1
two	1
for	1
an	1
hour,	1
each	1
couple,	1
the	1
crew	1
in	1
rotation	1
shall	1
mount	1
the	1
deck	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
all	1
goes	1
well.	1
But	1
sometimes,	1
especially	1
upon	1
the	1
Line	1
in	1
the	1
Pacific,	1
this	1
plan	1
will	1
not	1
answer	1
at	1
all;	1
because	1
such	1
incalculable	1
hosts	1
of	1
sharks	1
gather	1
round	1
the	1
moored	1
carcase,	1
that	1
were	1
he	1
left	1
so	1
for	1
six	1
hours,	1
say,	1
on	1
a	1
stretch,	1
little	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
skeleton	1
would	1
be	1
visible	1
by	1
morning.	1
In	1
most	1
other	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
ocean,	1
however,	1
where	1
these	1
fish	1
do	1
not	1
so	1
largely	1
abound,	1
their	1
wondrous	1
voracity	1
can	1
be	1
at	1
times	1
considerably	1
diminished,	1
by	1
vigorously	1
stirring	1
them	1
up	1
with	1
sharp	1
whaling-spades,	1
a	1
procedure	1
notwithstanding,	1
which,	1
in	1
some	1
instances,	1
only	1
seems	1
to	1
tickle	1
them	1
into	1
still	1
greater	1
activity.	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
thus	1
in	1
the	1
present	1
case	1
with	1
the	1
Pequod's	1
sharks;	1
though,	1
to	1
be	1
sure,	1
any	1
man	1
unaccustomed	1
to	1
such	1
sights,	1
to	1
have	1
looked	1
over	1
her	1
side	1
that	1
night,	1
would	1
have	1
almost	1
thought	1
the	1
whole	1
round	1
sea	1
was	1
one	1
huge	1
cheese,	1
and	1
those	1
sharks	1
the	1
maggots	1
in	1
it.	1
Nevertheless,	1
upon	1
Stubb	1
setting	1
the	1
anchor-watch	1
after	1
his	1
supper	1
was	1
concluded;	1
and	1
when,	1
accordingly,	1
Queequeg	1
and	1
a	1
forecastle	1
seaman	1
came	1
on	1
deck,	1
no	1
small	1
excitement	1
was	1
created	1
among	1
the	1
sharks;	1
for	1
immediately	1
suspending	1
the	1
cutting	1
stages	1
over	1
the	1
side,	1
and	1
lowering	1
three	1
lanterns,	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
cast	1
long	1
gleams	1
of	1
light	1
over	1
the	1
turbid	1
sea,	1
these	1
two	1
mariners,	1
darting	1
their	1
long	1
whaling-spades,	1
kept	1
up	1
an	1
incessant	1
murdering	1
of	1
the	1
sharks,*	1
by	1
striking	1
the	1
keen	1
steel	1
deep	1
into	1
their	1
skulls,	1
seemingly	1
their	1
only	1
vital	1
part.	1
But	1
in	1
the	1
foamy	1
confusion	1
of	1
their	1
mixed	1
and	1
struggling	1
hosts,	1
the	1
marksmen	1
could	1
not	1
always	1
hit	1
their	1
mark;	1
and	1
this	1
brought	1
about	1
new	1
revelations	1
of	1
the	1
incredible	1
ferocity	1
of	1
the	1
foe.	1
They	1
viciously	1
snapped,	1
not	1
only	1
at	1
each	1
other's	1
disembowelments,	1
but	1
like	1
flexible	1
bows,	1
bent	1
round,	1
and	1
bit	1
their	1
own;	1
till	1
those	1
entrails	1
seemed	1
swallowed	1
over	1
and	1
over	1
again	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
mouth,	1
to	1
be	1
oppositely	1
voided	1
by	1
the	1
gaping	1
wound.	1
Nor	1
was	1
this	1
all.	1
It	1
was	1
unsafe	1
to	1
meddle	1
with	1
the	1
corpses	1
and	1
ghosts	1
of	1
these	1
creatures.	1
A	1
sort	1
of	1
generic	1
or	1
Pantheistic	1
vitality	1
seemed	1
to	1
lurk	1
in	1
their	1
very	1
joints	1
and	1
bones,	1
after	1
what	1
might	1
be	1
called	1
the	1
individual	1
life	1
had	1
departed.	1
Killed	1
and	1
hoisted	1
on	1
deck	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
his	1
skin,	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
sharks	1
almost	1
took	1
poor	1
Queequeg's	1
hand	1
off,	1
when	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
shut	1
down	1
the	1
dead	1
lid	1
of	1
his	1
murderous	1
jaw.	1
*The	1
whaling-spade	1
used	1
for	1
cutting-in	1
is	1
made	1
of	1
the	1
very	1
best	1
steel;	1
is	1
about	1
the	1
bigness	1
of	1
a	1
man's	1
spread	1
hand;	1
and	1
in	1
general	1
shape,	1
corresponds	1
to	1
the	1
garden	1
implement	1
after	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
named;	1
only	1
its	1
sides	1
are	1
perfectly	1
flat,	1
and	1
its	1
upper	1
end	1
considerably	1
narrower	1
than	1
the	1
lower.	1
This	1
weapon	1
is	1
always	1
kept	1
as	1
sharp	1
as	1
possible;	1
and	1
when	1
being	1
used	1
is	1
occasionally	1
honed,	1
just	1
like	1
a	1
razor.	1
In	1
its	1
socket,	1
a	1
stiff	1
pole,	1
from	1
twenty	1
to	1
thirty	1
feet	1
long,	1
is	1
inserted	1
for	1
a	1
handle.	1
"Queequeg	1
no	1
care	1
what	1
god	1
made	1
him	1
shark,"	1
said	1
the	1
savage,	1
agonizingly	1
lifting	1
his	1
hand	1
up	1
and	1
down;	1
"wedder	1
Fejee	1
god	1
or	1
Nantucket	1
god;	1
but	1
de	1
god	1
wat	1
made	1
shark	1
must	1
be	1
one	1
dam	1
Ingin."	1
CHAPTER	1
67	1
Cutting	1
In.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
Saturday	1
night,	1
and	1
such	1
a	1
Sabbath	1
as	1
followed!	1
Ex	1
officio	1
professors	1
of	1
Sabbath	1
breaking	1
are	1
all	1
whalemen.	1
The	1
ivory	1
Pequod	1
was	1
turned	1
into	1
what	1
seemed	1
a	1
shamble;	1
every	1
sailor	1
a	1
butcher.	1
You	1
would	1
have	1
thought	1
we	1
were	1
offering	1
up	1
ten	1
thousand	1
red	1
oxen	1
to	1
the	1
sea	1
gods.	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
place,	1
the	1
enormous	1
cutting	1
tackles,	1
among	1
other	1
ponderous	1
things	1
comprising	1
a	1
cluster	1
of	1
blocks	1
generally	1
painted	1
green,	1
and	1
which	1
no	1
single	1
man	1
can	1
possibly	1
lift--this	1
vast	1
bunch	1
of	1
grapes	1
was	1
swayed	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
main-top	1
and	1
firmly	1
lashed	1
to	1
the	1
lower	1
mast-head,	1
the	1
strongest	1
point	1
anywhere	1
above	1
a	1
ship's	1
deck.	1
The	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
hawser-like	1
rope	1
winding	1
through	1
these	1
intricacies,	1
was	1
then	1
conducted	1
to	1
the	1
windlass,	1
and	1
the	1
huge	1
lower	1
block	1
of	1
the	1
tackles	1
was	1
swung	1
over	1
the	1
whale;	1
to	1
this	1
block	1
the	1
great	1
blubber	1
hook,	1
weighing	1
some	1
one	1
hundred	1
pounds,	1
was	1
attached.	1
And	1
now	1
suspended	1
in	1
stages	1
over	1
the	1
side,	1
Starbuck	1
and	1
Stubb,	1
the	1
mates,	1
armed	1
with	1
their	1
long	1
spades,	1
began	1
cutting	1
a	1
hole	1
in	1
the	1
body	1
for	1
the	1
insertion	1
of	1
the	1
hook	1
just	1
above	1
the	1
nearest	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
side-fins.	1
This	1
done,	1
a	1
broad,	1
semicircular	1
line	1
is	1
cut	1
round	1
the	1
hole,	1
the	1
hook	1
is	1
inserted,	1
and	1
the	1
main	1
body	1
of	1
the	1
crew	1
striking	1
up	1
a	1
wild	1
chorus,	1
now	1
commence	1
heaving	1
in	1
one	1
dense	1
crowd	1
at	1
the	1
windlass.	1
When	1
instantly,	1
the	1
entire	1
ship	1
careens	1
over	1
on	1
her	1
side;	1
every	1
bolt	1
in	1
her	1
starts	1
like	1
the	1
nail-heads	1
of	1
an	1
old	1
house	1
in	1
frosty	1
weather;	1
she	1
trembles,	1
quivers,	1
and	1
nods	1
her	1
frighted	1
mast-heads	1
to	1
the	1
sky.	1
More	1
and	1
more	1
she	1
leans	1
over	1
to	1
the	1
whale,	1
while	1
every	1
gasping	1
heave	1
of	1
the	1
windlass	1
is	1
answered	1
by	1
a	1
helping	1
heave	1
from	1
the	1
billows;	1
till	1
at	1
last,	1
a	1
swift,	1
startling	1
snap	1
is	1
heard;	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
swash	1
the	1
ship	1
rolls	1
upwards	1
and	1
backwards	1
from	1
the	1
whale,	1
and	1
the	1
triumphant	1
tackle	1
rises	1
into	1
sight	1
dragging	1
after	1
it	1
the	1
disengaged	1
semicircular	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
strip	1
of	1
blubber.	1
Now	1
as	1
the	1
blubber	1
envelopes	1
the	1
whale	1
precisely	1
as	1
the	1
rind	1
does	1
an	1
orange,	1
so	1
is	1
it	1
stripped	1
off	1
from	1
the	1
body	1
precisely	1
as	1
an	1
orange	1
is	1
sometimes	1
stripped	1
by	1
spiralizing	1
it.	1
For	1
the	1
strain	1
constantly	1
kept	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
windlass	1
continually	1
keeps	1
the	1
whale	1
rolling	1
over	1
and	1
over	1
in	1
the	1
water,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
blubber	1
in	1
one	1
strip	1
uniformly	1
peels	1
off	1
along	1
the	1
line	1
called	1
the	1
"scarf,"	1
simultaneously	1
cut	1
by	1
the	1
spades	1
of	1
Starbuck	1
and	1
Stubb,	1
the	1
mates;	1
and	1
just	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
thus	1
peeled	1
off,	1
and	1
indeed	1
by	1
that	1
very	1
act	1
itself,	1
it	1
is	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
being	1
hoisted	1
higher	1
and	1
higher	1
aloft	1
till	1
its	1
upper	1
end	1
grazes	1
the	1
main-top;	1
the	1
men	1
at	1
the	1
windlass	1
then	1
cease	1
heaving,	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
or	1
two	1
the	1
prodigious	1
blood-dripping	1
mass	1
sways	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
as	1
if	1
let	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
sky,	1
and	1
every	1
one	1
present	1
must	1
take	1
good	1
heed	1
to	1
dodge	1
it	1
when	1
it	1
swings,	1
else	1
it	1
may	1
box	1
his	1
ears	1
and	1
pitch	1
him	1
headlong	1
overboard.	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
attending	1
harpooneers	1
now	1
advances	1
with	1
a	1
long,	1
keen	1
weapon	1
called	1
a	1
boarding-sword,	1
and	1
watching	1
his	1
chance	1
he	1
dexterously	1
slices	1
out	1
a	1
considerable	1
hole	1
in	1
the	1
lower	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
swaying	1
mass.	1
Into	1
this	1
hole,	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
second	1
alternating	1
great	1
tackle	1
is	1
then	1
hooked	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
retain	1
a	1
hold	1
upon	1
the	1
blubber,	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
prepare	1
for	1
what	1
follows.	1
Whereupon,	1
this	1
accomplished	1
swordsman,	1
warning	1
all	1
hands	1
to	1
stand	1
off,	1
once	1
more	1
makes	1
a	1
scientific	1
dash	1
at	1
the	1
mass,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
few	1
sidelong,	1
desperate,	1
lunging	1
slicings,	1
severs	1
it	1
completely	1
in	1
twain;	1
so	1
that	1
while	1
the	1
short	1
lower	1
part	1
is	1
still	1
fast,	1
the	1
long	1
upper	1
strip,	1
called	1
a	1
blanket-piece,	1
swings	1
clear,	1
and	1
is	1
all	1
ready	1
for	1
lowering.	1
The	1
heavers	1
forward	1
now	1
resume	1
their	1
song,	1
and	1
while	1
the	1
one	1
tackle	1
is	1
peeling	1
and	1
hoisting	1
a	1
second	1
strip	1
from	1
the	1
whale,	1
the	1
other	1
is	1
slowly	1
slackened	1
away,	1
and	1
down	1
goes	1
the	1
first	1
strip	1
through	1
the	1
main	1
hatchway	1
right	1
beneath,	1
into	1
an	1
unfurnished	1
parlor	1
called	1
the	1
blubber-room.	1
Into	1
this	1
twilight	1
apartment	1
sundry	1
nimble	1
hands	1
keep	1
coiling	1
away	1
the	1
long	1
blanket-piece	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
great	1
live	1
mass	1
of	1
plaited	1
serpents.	1
And	1
thus	1
the	1
work	1
proceeds;	1
the	1
two	1
tackles	1
hoisting	1
and	1
lowering	1
simultaneously;	1
both	1
whale	1
and	1
windlass	1
heaving,	1
the	1
heavers	1
singing,	1
the	1
blubber-room	1
gentlemen	1
coiling,	1
the	1
mates	1
scarfing,	1
the	1
ship	1
straining,	1
and	1
all	1
hands	1
swearing	1
occasionally,	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
assuaging	1
the	1
general	1
friction.	1
CHAPTER	1
68	1
The	1
Blanket.	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
no	1
small	1
attention	1
to	1
that	1
not	1
unvexed	1
subject,	1
the	1
skin	1
of	1
the	1
whale.	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
controversies	1
about	1
it	1
with	1
experienced	1
whalemen	1
afloat,	1
and	1
learned	1
naturalists	1
ashore.	1
My	1
original	1
opinion	1
remains	1
unchanged;	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
an	1
opinion.	1
The	1
question	1
is,	1
what	1
and	1
where	1
is	1
the	1
skin	1
of	1
the	1
whale?	1
Already	1
you	1
know	1
what	1
his	1
blubber	1
is.	1
That	1
blubber	1
is	1
something	1
of	1
the	1
consistence	1
of	1
firm,	1
close-grained	1
beef,	1
but	1
tougher,	1
more	1
elastic	1
and	1
compact,	1
and	1
ranges	1
from	1
eight	1
or	1
ten	1
to	1
twelve	1
and	1
fifteen	1
inches	1
in	1
thickness.	1
Now,	1
however	1
preposterous	1
it	1
may	1
at	1
first	1
seem	1
to	1
talk	1
of	1
any	1
creature's	1
skin	1
as	1
being	1
of	1
that	1
sort	1
of	1
consistence	1
and	1
thickness,	1
yet	1
in	1
point	1
of	1
fact	1
these	1
are	1
no	1
arguments	1
against	1
such	1
a	1
presumption;	1
because	1
you	1
cannot	1
raise	1
any	1
other	1
dense	1
enveloping	1
layer	1
from	1
the	1
whale's	1
body	1
but	1
that	1
same	1
blubber;	1
and	1
the	1
outermost	1
enveloping	1
layer	1
of	1
any	1
animal,	1
if	1
reasonably	1
dense,	1
what	1
can	1
that	1
be	1
but	1
the	1
skin?	1
True,	1
from	1
the	1
unmarred	1
dead	1
body	1
of	1
the	1
whale,	1
you	1
may	1
scrape	1
off	1
with	1
your	1
hand	1
an	1
infinitely	1
thin,	1
transparent	1
substance,	1
somewhat	1
resembling	1
the	1
thinnest	1
shreds	1
of	1
isinglass,	1
only	1
it	1
is	1
almost	1
as	1
flexible	1
and	1
soft	1
as	1
satin;	1
that	1
is,	1
previous	1
to	1
being	1
dried,	1
when	1
it	1
not	1
only	1
contracts	1
and	1
thickens,	1
but	1
becomes	1
rather	1
hard	1
and	1
brittle.	1
I	1
have	1
several	1
such	1
dried	1
bits,	1
which	1
I	1
use	1
for	1
marks	1
in	1
my	1
whale-books.	1
It	1
is	1
transparent,	1
as	1
I	1
said	1
before;	1
and	1
being	1
laid	1
upon	1
the	1
printed	1
page,	1
I	1
have	1
sometimes	1
pleased	1
myself	1
with	1
fancying	1
it	1
exerted	1
a	1
magnifying	1
influence.	1
At	1
any	1
rate,	1
it	1
is	1
pleasant	1
to	1
read	1
about	1
whales	1
through	1
their	1
own	1
spectacles,	1
as	1
you	1
may	1
say.	1
But	1
what	1
I	1
am	1
driving	1
at	1
here	1
is	1
this.	1
That	1
same	1
infinitely	1
thin,	1
isinglass	1
substance,	1
which,	1
I	1
admit,	1
invests	1
the	1
entire	1
body	1
of	1
the	1
whale,	1
is	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
to	1
be	1
regarded	1
as	1
the	1
skin	1
of	1
the	1
creature,	1
as	1
the	1
skin	1
of	1
the	1
skin,	1
so	1
to	1
speak;	1
for	1
it	1
were	1
simply	1
ridiculous	1
to	1
say,	1
that	1
the	1
proper	1
skin	1
of	1
the	1
tremendous	1
whale	1
is	1
thinner	1
and	1
more	1
tender	1
than	1
the	1
skin	1
of	1
a	1
new-born	1
child.	1
But	1
no	1
more	1
of	1
this.	1
Assuming	1
the	1
blubber	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
skin	1
of	1
the	1
whale;	1
then,	1
when	1
this	1
skin,	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
a	1
very	1
large	1
Sperm	1
Whale,	1
will	1
yield	1
the	1
bulk	1
of	1
one	1
hundred	1
barrels	1
of	1
oil;	1
and,	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
considered	1
that,	1
in	1
quantity,	1
or	1
rather	1
weight,	1
that	1
oil,	1
in	1
its	1
expressed	1
state,	1
is	1
only	1
three	1
fourths,	1
and	1
not	1
the	1
entire	1
substance	1
of	1
the	1
coat;	1
some	1
idea	1
may	1
hence	1
be	1
had	1
of	1
the	1
enormousness	1
of	1
that	1
animated	1
mass,	1
a	1
mere	1
part	1
of	1
whose	1
mere	1
integument	1
yields	1
such	1
a	1
lake	1
of	1
liquid	1
as	1
that.	1
Reckoning	1
ten	1
barrels	1
to	1
the	1
ton,	1
you	1
have	1
ten	1
tons	1
for	1
the	1
net	1
weight	1
of	1
only	1
three	1
quarters	1
of	1
the	1
stuff	1
of	1
the	1
whale's	1
skin.	1
In	1
life,	1
the	1
visible	1
surface	1
of	1
the	1
Sperm	1
Whale	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
least	1
among	1
the	1
many	1
marvels	1
he	1
presents.	1
Almost	1
invariably	1
it	1
is	1
all	1
over	1
obliquely	1
crossed	1
and	1
re-crossed	1
with	1
numberless	1
straight	1
marks	1
in	1
thick	1
array,	1
something	1
like	1
those	1
in	1
the	1
finest	1
Italian	1
line	1
engravings.	1
But	1
these	1
marks	1
do	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
impressed	1
upon	1
the	1
isinglass	1
substance	1
above	1
mentioned,	1
but	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
through	1
it,	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
engraved	1
upon	1
the	1
body	1
itself.	1
Nor	1
is	1
this	1
all.	1
In	1
some	1
instances,	1
to	1
the	1
quick,	1
observant	1
eye,	1
those	1
linear	1
marks,	1
as	1
in	1
a	1
veritable	1
engraving,	1
but	1
afford	1
the	1
ground	1
for	1
far	1
other	1
delineations.	1
These	1
are	1
hieroglyphical;	1
that	1
is,	1
if	1
you	1
call	1
those	1
mysterious	1
cyphers	1
on	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
pyramids	1
hieroglyphics,	1
then	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
proper	1
word	1
to	1
use	1
in	1
the	1
present	1
connexion.	1
By	1
my	1
retentive	1
memory	1
of	1
the	1
hieroglyphics	1
upon	1
one	1
Sperm	1
Whale	1
in	1
particular,	1
I	1
was	1
much	1
struck	1
with	1
a	1
plate	1
representing	1
the	1
old	1
Indian	1
characters	1
chiselled	1
on	1
the	1
famous	1
hieroglyphic	1
palisades	1
on	1
the	1
banks	1
of	1
the	1
Upper	1
Mississippi.	1
Like	1
those	1
mystic	1
rocks,	1
too,	1
the	1
mystic-marked	1
whale	1
remains	1
undecipherable.	1
This	1
allusion	1
to	1
the	1
Indian	1
rocks	1
reminds	1
me	1
of	1
another	1
thing.	1
Besides	1
all	1
the	1
other	1
phenomena	1
which	1
the	1
exterior	1
of	1
the	1
Sperm	1
Whale	1
presents,	1
he	1
not	1
seldom	1
displays	1
the	1
back,	1
and	1
more	1
especially	1
his	1
flanks,	1
effaced	1
in	1
great	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
regular	1
linear	1
appearance,	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
numerous	1
rude	1
scratches,	1
altogether	1
of	1
an	1
irregular,	1
random	1
aspect.	1
I	1
should	1
say	1
that	1
those	1
New	1
England	1
rocks	1
on	1
the	1
sea-coast,	1
which	1
Agassiz	1
imagines	1
to	1
bear	1
the	1
marks	1
of	1
violent	1
scraping	1
contact	1
with	1
vast	1
floating	1
icebergs--I	1
should	1
say,	1
that	1
those	1
rocks	1
must	1
not	1
a	1
little	1
resemble	1
the	1
Sperm	1
Whale	1
in	1
this	1
particular.	1
It	1
also	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
such	1
scratches	1
in	1
the	1
whale	1
are	1
probably	1
made	1
by	1
hostile	1
contact	1
with	1
other	1
whales;	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
most	1
remarked	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
large,	1
full-grown	1
bulls	1
of	1
the	1
species.	1
A	1
word	1
or	1
two	1
more	1
concerning	1
this	1
matter	1
of	1
the	1
skin	1
or	1
blubber	1
of	1
the	1
whale.	1
It	1
has	1
already	1
been	1
said,	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
stript	1
from	1
him	1
in	1
long	1
pieces,	1
called	1
blanket-pieces.	1
Like	1
most	1
sea-terms,	1
this	1
one	1
is	1
very	1
happy	1
and	1
significant.	1
For	1
the	1
whale	1
is	1
indeed	1
wrapt	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
blubber	1
as	1
in	1
a	1
real	1
blanket	1
or	1
counterpane;	1
or,	1
still	1
better,	1
an	1
Indian	1
poncho	1
slipt	1
over	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
skirting	1
his	1
extremity.	1
It	1
is	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
this	1
cosy	1
blanketing	1
of	1
his	1
body,	1
that	1
the	1
whale	1
is	1
enabled	1
to	1
keep	1
himself	1
comfortable	1
in	1
all	1
weathers,	1
in	1
all	1
seas,	1
times,	1
and	1
tides.	1
What	1
would	1
become	1
of	1
a	1
Greenland	1
whale,	1
say,	1
in	1
those	1
shuddering,	1
icy	1
seas	1
of	1
the	1
North,	1
if	1
unsupplied	1
with	1
his	1
cosy	1
surtout?	1
True,	1
other	1
fish	1
are	1
found	1
exceedingly	1
brisk	1
in	1
those	1
Hyperborean	1
waters;	1
but	1
these,	1
be	1
it	1
observed,	1
are	1
your	1
cold-blooded,	1
lungless	1
fish,	1
whose	1
very	1
bellies	1
are	1
refrigerators;	1
creatures,	1
that	1
warm	1
themselves	1
under	1
the	1
lee	1
of	1
an	1
iceberg,	1
as	1
a	1
traveller	1
in	1
winter	1
would	1
bask	1
before	1
an	1
inn	1
fire;	1
whereas,	1
like	1
man,	1
the	1
whale	1
has	1
lungs	1
and	1
warm	1
blood.	1
Freeze	1
his	1
blood,	1
and	1
he	1
dies.	1
How	1
wonderful	1
is	1
it	1
then--except	1
after	1
explanation--that	1
this	1
great	1
monster,	1
to	1
whom	1
corporeal	1
warmth	1
is	1
as	1
indispensable	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
man;	1
how	1
wonderful	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
found	1
at	1
home,	1
immersed	1
to	1
his	1
lips	1
for	1
life	1
in	1
those	1
Arctic	1
waters!	1
where,	1
when	1
seamen	1
fall	1
overboard,	1
they	1
are	1
sometimes	1
found,	1
months	1
afterwards,	1
perpendicularly	1
frozen	1
into	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
fields	1
of	1
ice,	1
as	1
a	1
fly	1
is	1
found	1
glued	1
in	1
amber.	1
But	1
more	1
surprising	1
is	1
it	1
to	1
know,	1
as	1
has	1
been	1
proved	1
by	1
experiment,	1
that	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
a	1
Polar	1
whale	1
is	1
warmer	1
than	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
Borneo	1
negro	1
in	1
summer.	1
It	1
does	1
seem	1
to	1
me,	1
that	1
herein	1
we	1
see	1
the	1
rare	1
virtue	1
of	1
a	1
strong	1
individual	1
vitality,	1
and	1
the	1
rare	1
virtue	1
of	1
thick	1
walls,	1
and	1
the	1
rare	1
virtue	1
of	1
interior	1
spaciousness.	1
Oh,	1
man!	1
admire	1
and	1
model	1
thyself	1
after	1
the	1
whale!	1
Do	1
thou,	1
too,	1
remain	1
warm	1
among	1
ice.	1
Do	1
thou,	1
too,	1
live	1
in	1
this	1
world	1
without	1
being	1
of	1
it.	1
Be	1
cool	1
at	1
the	1
equator;	1
keep	1
thy	1
blood	1
fluid	1
at	1
the	1
Pole.	1
Like	1
the	1
great	1
dome	1
of	1
St.	1
Peter's,	1
and	1
like	1
the	1
great	1
whale,	1
retain,	1
O	1
man!	1
in	1
all	1
seasons	1
a	1
temperature	1
of	1
thine	1
own.	1
But	1
how	1
easy	1
and	1
how	1
hopeless	1
to	1
teach	1
these	1
fine	1
things!	1
Of	1
erections,	1
how	1
few	1
are	1
domed	1
like	1
St.	1
Peter's!	1
of	1
creatures,	1
how	1
few	1
vast	1
as	1
the	1
whale!	1
CHAPTER	1
69	1
The	1
Funeral.	1
Haul	1
in	1
the	1
chains!	1
Let	1
the	1
carcase	1
go	1
astern!	1
The	1
vast	1
tackles	1
have	1
now	1
done	1
their	1
duty.	1
The	1
peeled	1
white	1
body	1
of	1
the	1
beheaded	1
whale	1
flashes	1
like	1
a	1
marble	1
sepulchre;	1
though	1
changed	1
in	1
hue,	1
it	1
has	1
not	1
perceptibly	1
lost	1
anything	1
in	1
bulk.	1
It	1
is	1
still	1
colossal.	1
Slowly	1
it	1
floats	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
away,	1
the	1
water	1
round	1
it	1
torn	1
and	1
splashed	1
by	1
the	1
insatiate	1
sharks,	1
and	1
the	1
air	1
above	1
vexed	1
with	1
rapacious	1
flights	1
of	1
screaming	1
fowls,	1
whose	1
beaks	1
are	1
like	1
so	1
many	1
insulting	1
poniards	1
in	1
the	1
whale.	1
The	1
vast	1
white	1
headless	1
phantom	1
floats	1
further	1
and	1
further	1
from	1
the	1
ship,	1
and	1
every	1
rod	1
that	1
it	1
so	1
floats,	1
what	1
seem	1
square	1
roods	1
of	1
sharks	1
and	1
cubic	1
roods	1
of	1
fowls,	1
augment	1
the	1
murderous	1
din.	1
For	1
hours	1
and	1
hours	1
from	1
the	1
almost	1
stationary	1
ship	1
that	1
hideous	1
sight	1
is	1
seen.	1
Beneath	1
the	1
unclouded	1
and	1
mild	1
azure	1
sky,	1
upon	1
the	1
fair	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
pleasant	1
sea,	1
wafted	1
by	1
the	1
joyous	1
breezes,	1
that	1
great	1
mass	1
of	1
death	1
floats	1
on	1
and	1
on,	1
till	1
lost	1
in	1
infinite	1
perspectives.	1
There's	1
a	1
most	1
doleful	1
and	1
most	1
mocking	1
funeral!	1
The	1
sea-vultures	1
all	1
in	1
pious	1
mourning,	1
the	1
air-sharks	1
all	1
punctiliously	1
in	1
black	1
or	1
speckled.	1
In	1
life	1
but	1
few	1
of	1
them	1
would	1
have	1
helped	1
the	1
whale,	1
I	1
ween,	1
if	1
peradventure	1
he	1
had	1
needed	1
it;	1
but	1
upon	1
the	1
banquet	1
of	1
his	1
funeral	1
they	1
most	1
piously	1
do	1
pounce.	1
Oh,	1
horrible	1
vultureism	1
of	1
earth!	1
from	1
which	1
not	1
the	1
mightiest	1
whale	1
is	1
free.	1
Nor	1
is	1
this	1
the	1
end.	1
Desecrated	1
as	1
the	1
body	1
is,	1
a	1
vengeful	1
ghost	1
survives	1
and	1
hovers	1
over	1
it	1
to	1
scare.	1
Espied	1
by	1
some	1
timid	1
man-of-war	1
or	1
blundering	1
discovery-vessel	1
from	1
afar,	1
when	1
the	1
distance	1
obscuring	1
the	1
swarming	1
fowls,	1
nevertheless	1
still	1
shows	1
the	1
white	1
mass	1
floating	1
in	1
the	1
sun,	1
and	1
the	1
white	1
spray	1
heaving	1
high	1
against	1
it;	1
straightway	1
the	1
whale's	1
unharming	1
corpse,	1
with	1
trembling	1
fingers	1
is	1
set	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
log--SHOALS,	1
ROCKS,	1
AND	1
BREAKERS	1
HEREABOUTS:	1
BEWARE!	1
And	1
for	1
years	1
afterwards,	1
perhaps,	1
ships	1
shun	1
the	1
place;	1
leaping	1
over	1
it	1
as	1
silly	1
sheep	1
leap	1
over	1
a	1
vacuum,	1
because	1
their	1
leader	1
originally	1
leaped	1
there	1
when	1
a	1
stick	1
was	1
held.	1
There's	1
your	1
law	1
of	1
precedents;	1
there's	1
your	1
utility	1
of	1
traditions;	1
there's	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
your	1
obstinate	1
survival	1
of	1
old	1
beliefs	1
never	1
bottomed	1
on	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
now	1
not	1
even	1
hovering	1
in	1
the	1
air!	1
There's	1
orthodoxy!	1
Thus,	1
while	1
in	1
life	1
the	1
great	1
whale's	1
body	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
real	1
terror	1
to	1
his	1
foes,	1
in	1
his	1
death	1
his	1
ghost	1
becomes	1
a	1
powerless	1
panic	1
to	1
a	1
world.	1
Are	1
you	1
a	1
believer	1
in	1
ghosts,	1
my	1
friend?	1
There	1
are	1
other	1
ghosts	1
than	1
the	1
Cock-Lane	1
one,	1
and	1
far	1
deeper	1
men	1
than	1
Doctor	1
Johnson	1
who	1
believe	1
in	1
them.	1
CHAPTER	1
70	1
The	1
Sphynx.	1
It	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
omitted	1
that	1
previous	1
to	1
completely	1
stripping	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
the	1
leviathan,	1
he	1
was	1
beheaded.	1
Now,	1
the	1
beheading	1
of	1
the	1
Sperm	1
Whale	1
is	1
a	1
scientific	1
anatomical	1
feat,	1
upon	1
which	1
experienced	1
whale	1
surgeons	1
very	1
much	1
pride	1
themselves:	1
and	1
not	1
without	1
reason.	1
Consider	1
that	1
the	1
whale	1
has	1
nothing	1
that	1
can	1
properly	1
be	1
called	1
a	1
neck;	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
where	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
body	1
seem	1
to	1
join,	1
there,	1
in	1
that	1
very	1
place,	1
is	1
the	1
thickest	1
part	1
of	1
him.	1
Remember,	1
also,	1
that	1
the	1
surgeon	1
must	1
operate	1
from	1
above,	1
some	1
eight	1
or	1
ten	1
feet	1
intervening	1
between	1
him	1
and	1
his	1
subject,	1
and	1
that	1
subject	1
almost	1
hidden	1
in	1
a	1
discoloured,	1
rolling,	1
and	1
oftentimes	1
tumultuous	1
and	1
bursting	1
sea.	1
Bear	1
in	1
mind,	1
too,	1
that	1
under	1
these	1
untoward	1
circumstances	1
he	1
has	1
to	1
cut	1
many	1
feet	1
deep	1
in	1
the	1
flesh;	1
and	1
in	1
that	1
subterraneous	1
manner,	1
without	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
getting	1
one	1
single	1
peep	1
into	1
the	1
ever-contracting	1
gash	1
thus	1
made,	1
he	1
must	1
skilfully	1
steer	1
clear	1
of	1
all	1
adjacent,	1
interdicted	1
parts,	1
and	1
exactly	1
divide	1
the	1
spine	1
at	1
a	1
critical	1
point	1
hard	1
by	1
its	1
insertion	1
into	1
the	1
skull.	1
Do	1
you	1
not	1
marvel,	1
then,	1
at	1
Stubb's	1
boast,	1
that	1
he	1
demanded	1
but	1
ten	1
minutes	1
to	1
behead	1
a	1
sperm	1
whale?	1
When	1
first	1
severed,	1
the	1
head	1
is	1
dropped	1
astern	1
and	1
held	1
there	1
by	1
a	1
cable	1
till	1
the	1
body	1
is	1
stripped.	1
That	1
done,	1
if	1
it	1
belong	1
to	1
a	1
small	1
whale	1
it	1
is	1
hoisted	1
on	1
deck	1
to	1
be	1
deliberately	1
disposed	1
of.	1
But,	1
with	1
a	1
full	1
grown	1
leviathan	1
this	1
is	1
impossible;	1
for	1
the	1
sperm	1
whale's	1
head	1
embraces	1
nearly	1
one	1
third	1
of	1
his	1
entire	1
bulk,	1
and	1
completely	1
to	1
suspend	1
such	1
a	1
burden	1
as	1
that,	1
even	1
by	1
the	1
immense	1
tackles	1
of	1
a	1
whaler,	1
this	1
were	1
as	1
vain	1
a	1
thing	1
as	1
to	1
attempt	1
weighing	1
a	1
Dutch	1
barn	1
in	1
jewellers'	1
scales.	1
The	1
Pequod's	1
whale	1
being	1
decapitated	1
and	1
the	1
body	1
stripped,	1
the	1
head	1
was	1
hoisted	1
against	1
the	1
ship's	1
side--about	1
half	1
way	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
yet	1
in	1
great	1
part	1
be	1
buoyed	1
up	1
by	1
its	1
native	1
element.	1
And	1
there	1
with	1
the	1
strained	1
craft	1
steeply	1
leaning	1
over	1
to	1
it,	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
the	1
enormous	1
downward	1
drag	1
from	1
the	1
lower	1
mast-head,	1
and	1
every	1
yard-arm	1
on	1
that	1
side	1
projecting	1
like	1
a	1
crane	1
over	1
the	1
waves;	1
there,	1
that	1
blood-dripping	1
head	1
hung	1
to	1
the	1
Pequod's	1
waist	1
like	1
the	1
giant	1
Holofernes's	1
from	1
the	1
girdle	1
of	1
Judith.	1
When	1
this	1
last	1
task	1
was	1
accomplished	1
it	1
was	1
noon,	1
and	1
the	1
seamen	1
went	1
below	1
to	1
their	1
dinner.	1
Silence	1
reigned	1
over	1
the	1
before	1
tumultuous	1
but	1
now	1
deserted	1
deck.	1
An	1
intense	1
copper	1
calm,	1
like	1
a	1
universal	1
yellow	1
lotus,	1
was	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
unfolding	1
its	1
noiseless	1
measureless	1
leaves	1
upon	1
the	1
sea.	1
A	1
short	1
space	1
elapsed,	1
and	1
up	1
into	1
this	1
noiselessness	1
came	1
Ahab	1
alone	1
from	1
his	1
cabin.	1
Taking	1
a	1
few	1
turns	1
on	1
the	1
quarter-deck,	1
he	1
paused	1
to	1
gaze	1
over	1
the	1
side,	1
then	1
slowly	1
getting	1
into	1
the	1
main-chains	1
he	1
took	1
Stubb's	1
long	1
spade--still	1
remaining	1
there	1
after	1
the	1
whale's	1
Decapitation--and	1
striking	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
lower	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
half-suspended	1
mass,	1
placed	1
its	1
other	1
end	1
crutch-wise	1
under	1
one	1
arm,	1
and	1
so	1
stood	1
leaning	1
over	1
with	1
eyes	1
attentively	1
fixed	1
on	1
this	1
head.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
black	1
and	1
hooded	1
head;	1
and	1
hanging	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
so	1
intense	1
a	1
calm,	1
it	1
seemed	1
the	1
Sphynx's	1
in	1
the	1
desert.	1
"Speak,	1
thou	1
vast	1
and	1
venerable	1
head,"	1
muttered	1
Ahab,	1
"which,	1
though	1
ungarnished	1
with	1
a	1
beard,	1
yet	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
lookest	1
hoary	1
with	1
mosses;	1
speak,	1
mighty	1
head,	1
and	1
tell	1
us	1
the	1
secret	1
thing	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
thee.	1
Of	1
all	1
divers,	1
thou	1
hast	1
dived	1
the	1
deepest.	1
That	1
head	1
upon	1
which	1
the	1
upper	1
sun	1
now	1
gleams,	1
has	1
moved	1
amid	1
this	1
world's	1
foundations.	1
Where	1
unrecorded	1
names	1
and	1
navies	1
rust,	1
and	1
untold	1
hopes	1
and	1
anchors	1
rot;	1
where	1
in	1
her	1
murderous	1
hold	1
this	1
frigate	1
earth	1
is	1
ballasted	1
with	1
bones	1
of	1
millions	1
of	1
the	1
drowned;	1
there,	1
in	1
that	1
awful	1
water-land,	1
there	1
was	1
thy	1
most	1
familiar	1
home.	1
Thou	1
hast	1
been	1
where	1
bell	1
or	1
diver	1
never	1
went;	1
hast	1
slept	1
by	1
many	1
a	1
sailor's	1
side,	1
where	1
sleepless	1
mothers	1
would	1
give	1
their	1
lives	1
to	1
lay	1
them	1
down.	1
Thou	1
saw'st	1
the	1
locked	1
lovers	1
when	1
leaping	1
from	1
their	1
flaming	1
ship;	1
heart	1
to	1
heart	1
they	1
sank	1
beneath	1
the	1
exulting	1
wave;	1
true	1
to	1
each	1
other,	1
when	1
heaven	1
seemed	1
false	1
to	1
them.	1
Thou	1
saw'st	1
the	1
murdered	1
mate	1
when	1
tossed	1
by	1
pirates	1
from	1
the	1
midnight	1
deck;	1
for	1
hours	1
he	1
fell	1
into	1
the	1
deeper	1
midnight	1
of	1
the	1
insatiate	1
maw;	1
and	1
his	1
murderers	1
still	1
sailed	1
on	1
unharmed--while	1
swift	1
lightnings	1
shivered	1
the	1
neighboring	1
ship	1
that	1
would	1
have	1
borne	1
a	1
righteous	1
husband	1
to	1
outstretched,	1
longing	1
arms.	1
O	1
head!	1
thou	1
hast	1
seen	1
enough	1
to	1
split	1
the	1
planets	1
and	1
make	1
an	1
infidel	1
of	1
Abraham,	1
and	1
not	1
one	1
syllable	1
is	1
thine!"	1
"Sail	1
ho!"	1
cried	1
a	1
triumphant	1
voice	1
from	1
the	1
main-mast-head.	1
"Aye?	1
Well,	1
now,	1
that's	1
cheering,"	1
cried	1
Ahab,	1
suddenly	1
erecting	1
himself,	1
while	1
whole	1
thunder-clouds	1
swept	1
aside	1
from	1
his	1
brow.	1
"That	1
lively	1
cry	1
upon	1
this	1
deadly	1
calm	1
might	1
almost	1
convert	1
a	1
better	1
man.--Where	1
away?"	1
"Three	1
points	1
on	1
the	1
starboard	1
bow,	1
sir,	1
and	1
bringing	1
down	1
her	1
breeze	1
to	1
us!	1
"Better	1
and	1
better,	1
man.	1
Would	1
now	1
St.	1
Paul	1
would	1
come	1
along	1
that	1
way,	1
and	1
to	1
my	1
breezelessness	1
bring	1
his	1
breeze!	1
O	1
Nature,	1
and	1
O	1
soul	1
of	1
man!	1
how	1
far	1
beyond	1
all	1
utterance	1
are	1
your	1
linked	1
analogies!	1
not	1
the	1
smallest	1
atom	1
stirs	1
or	1
lives	1
on	1
matter,	1
but	1
has	1
its	1
cunning	1
duplicate	1
in	1
mind."	1
CHAPTER	1
71	1
The	1
Jeroboam's	1
Story.	1
Hand	1
in	1
hand,	1
ship	1
and	1
breeze	1
blew	1
on;	1
but	1
the	1
breeze	1
came	1
faster	1
than	1
the	1
ship,	1
and	1
soon	1
the	1
Pequod	1
began	1
to	1
rock.	1
By	1
and	1
by,	1
through	1
the	1
glass	1
the	1
stranger's	1
boats	1
and	1
manned	1
mast-heads	1
proved	1
her	1
a	1
whale-ship.	1
But	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
so	1
far	1
to	1
windward,	1
and	1
shooting	1
by,	1
apparently	1
making	1
a	1
passage	1
to	1
some	1
other	1
ground,	1
the	1
Pequod	1
could	1
not	1
hope	1
to	1
reach	1
her.	1
So	1
the	1
signal	1
was	1
set	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
response	1
would	1
be	1
made.	1
Here	1
be	1
it	1
said,	1
that	1
like	1
the	1
vessels	1
of	1
military	1
marines,	1
the	1
ships	1
of	1
the	1
American	1
Whale	1
Fleet	1
have	1
each	1
a	1
private	1
signal;	1
all	1
which	1
signals	1
being	1
collected	1
in	1
a	1
book	1
with	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
the	1
respective	1
vessels	1
attached,	1
every	1
captain	1
is	1
provided	1
with	1
it.	1
Thereby,	1
the	1
whale	1
commanders	1
are	1
enabled	1
to	1
recognise	1
each	1
other	1
upon	1
the	1
ocean,	1
even	1
at	1
considerable	1
distances	1
and	1
with	1
no	1
small	1
facility.	1
The	1
Pequod's	1
signal	1
was	1
at	1
last	1
responded	1
to	1
by	1
the	1
stranger's	1
setting	1
her	1
own;	1
which	1
proved	1
the	1
ship	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
Jeroboam	1
of	1
Nantucket.	1
Squaring	1
her	1
yards,	1
she	1
bore	1
down,	1
ranged	1
abeam	1
under	1
the	1
Pequod's	1
lee,	1
and	1
lowered	1
a	1
boat;	1
it	1
soon	1
drew	1
nigh;	1
but,	1
as	1
the	1
side-ladder	1
was	1
being	1
rigged	1
by	1
Starbuck's	1
order	1
to	1
accommodate	1
the	1
visiting	1
captain,	1
the	1
stranger	1
in	1
question	1
waved	1
his	1
hand	1
from	1
his	1
boat's	1
stern	1
in	1
token	1
of	1
that	1
proceeding	1
being	1
entirely	1
unnecessary.	1
It	1
turned	1
out	1
that	1
the	1
Jeroboam	1
had	1
a	1
malignant	1
epidemic	1
on	1
board,	1
and	1
that	1
Mayhew,	1
her	1
captain,	1
was	1
fearful	1
of	1
infecting	1
the	1
Pequod's	1
company.	1
For,	1
though	1
himself	1
and	1
boat's	1
crew	1
remained	1
untainted,	1
and	1
though	1
his	1
ship	1
was	1
half	1
a	1
rifle-shot	1
off,	1
and	1
an	1
incorruptible	1
sea	1
and	1
air	1
rolling	1
and	1
flowing	1
between;	1
yet	1
conscientiously	1
adhering	1
to	1
the	1
timid	1
quarantine	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
he	1
peremptorily	1
refused	1
to	1
come	1
into	1
direct	1
contact	1
with	1
the	1
Pequod.	1
But	1
this	1
did	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
prevent	1
all	1
communications.	1
Preserving	1
an	1
interval	1
of	1
some	1
few	1
yards	1
between	1
itself	1
and	1
the	1
ship,	1
the	1
Jeroboam's	1
boat	1
by	1
the	1
occasional	1
use	1
of	1
its	1
oars	1
contrived	1
to	1
keep	1
parallel	1
to	1
the	1
Pequod,	1
as	1
she	1
heavily	1
forged	1
through	1
the	1
sea	1
(for	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
it	1
blew	1
very	1
fresh),	1
with	1
her	1
main-topsail	1
aback;	1
though,	1
indeed,	1
at	1
times	1
by	1
the	1
sudden	1
onset	1
of	1
a	1
large	1
rolling	1
wave,	1
the	1
boat	1
would	1
be	1
pushed	1
some	1
way	1
ahead;	1
but	1
would	1
be	1
soon	1
skilfully	1
brought	1
to	1
her	1
proper	1
bearings	1
again.	1
Subject	1
to	1
this,	1
and	1
other	1
the	1
like	1
interruptions	1
now	1
and	1
then,	1
a	1
conversation	1
was	1
sustained	1
between	1
the	1
two	1
parties;	1
but	1
at	1
intervals	1
not	1
without	1
still	1
another	1
interruption	1
of	1
a	1
very	1
different	1
sort.	1
Pulling	1
an	1
oar	1
in	1
the	1
Jeroboam's	1
boat,	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
a	1
singular	1
appearance,	1
even	1
in	1
that	1
wild	1
whaling	1
life	1
where	1
individual	1
notabilities	1
make	1
up	1
all	1
totalities.	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
small,	1
short,	1
youngish	1
man,	1
sprinkled	1
all	1
over	1
his	1
face	1
with	1
freckles,	1
and	1
wearing	1
redundant	1
yellow	1
hair.	1
A	1
long-skirted,	1
cabalistically-cut	1
coat	1
of	1
a	1
faded	1
walnut	1
tinge	1
enveloped	1
him;	1
the	1
overlapping	1
sleeves	1
of	1
which	1
were	1
rolled	1
up	1
on	1
his	1
wrists.	1
A	1
deep,	1
settled,	1
fanatic	1
delirium	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
eyes.	1
So	1
soon	1
as	1
this	1
figure	1
had	1
been	1
first	1
descried,	1
Stubb	1
had	1
exclaimed--"That's	1
he!	1
that's	1
he!--the	1
long-togged	1
scaramouch	1
the	1
Town-Ho's	1
company	1
told	1
us	1
of!"	1
Stubb	1
here	1
alluded	1
to	1
a	1
strange	1
story	1
told	1
of	1
the	1
Jeroboam,	1
and	1
a	1
certain	1
man	1
among	1
her	1
crew,	1
some	1
time	1
previous	1
when	1
the	1
Pequod	1
spoke	1
the	1
Town-Ho.	1
According	1
to	1
this	1
account	1
and	1
what	1
was	1
subsequently	1
learned,	1
it	1
seemed	1
that	1
the	1
scaramouch	1
in	1
question	1
had	1
gained	1
a	1
wonderful	1
ascendency	1
over	1
almost	1
everybody	1
in	1
the	1
Jeroboam.	1
His	1
story	1
was	1
this:	1
He	1
had	1
been	1
originally	1
nurtured	1
among	1
the	1
crazy	1
society	1
of	1
Neskyeuna	1
Shakers,	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
great	1
prophet;	1
in	1
their	1
cracked,	1
secret	1
meetings	1
having	1
several	1
times	1
descended	1
from	1
heaven	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
a	1
trap-door,	1
announcing	1
the	1
speedy	1
opening	1
of	1
the	1
seventh	1
vial,	1
which	1
he	1
carried	1
in	1
his	1
vest-pocket;	1
but,	1
which,	1
instead	1
of	1
containing	1
gunpowder,	1
was	1
supposed	1
to	1
be	1
charged	1
with	1
laudanum.	1
A	1
strange,	1
apostolic	1
whim	1
having	1
seized	1
him,	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
Neskyeuna	1
for	1
Nantucket,	1
where,	1
with	1
that	1
cunning	1
peculiar	1
to	1
craziness,	1
he	1
assumed	1
a	1
steady,	1
common-sense	1
exterior,	1
and	1
offered	1
himself	1
as	1
a	1
green-hand	1
candidate	1
for	1
the	1
Jeroboam's	1
whaling	1
voyage.	1
They	1
engaged	1
him;	1
but	1
straightway	1
upon	1
the	1
ship's	1
getting	1
out	1
of	1
sight	1
of	1
land,	1
his	1
insanity	1
broke	1
out	1
in	1
a	1
freshet.	1
He	1
announced	1
himself	1
as	1
the	1
archangel	1
Gabriel,	1
and	1
commanded	1
the	1
captain	1
to	1
jump	1
overboard.	1
He	1
published	1
his	1
manifesto,	1
whereby	1
he	1
set	1
himself	1
forth	1
as	1
the	1
deliverer	1
of	1
the	1
isles	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
and	1
vicar-general	1
of	1
all	1
Oceanica.	1
The	1
unflinching	1
earnestness	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
declared	1
these	1
things;--the	1
dark,	1
daring	1
play	1
of	1
his	1
sleepless,	1
excited	1
imagination,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
preternatural	1
terrors	1
of	1
real	1
delirium,	1
united	1
to	1
invest	1
this	1
Gabriel	1
in	1
the	1
minds	1
of	1
the	1
majority	1
of	1
the	1
ignorant	1
crew,	1
with	1
an	1
atmosphere	1
of	1
sacredness.	1
Moreover,	1
they	1
were	1
afraid	1
of	1
him.	1
As	1
such	1
a	1
man,	1
however,	1
was	1
not	1
of	1
much	1
practical	1
use	1
in	1
the	1
ship,	1
especially	1
as	1
he	1
refused	1
to	1
work	1
except	1
when	1
he	1
pleased,	1
the	1
incredulous	1
captain	1
would	1
fain	1
have	1
been	1
rid	1
of	1
him;	1
but	1
apprised	1
that	1
that	1
individual's	1
intention	1
was	1
to	1
land	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
convenient	1
port,	1
the	1
archangel	1
forthwith	1
opened	1
all	1
his	1
seals	1
and	1
vials--devoting	1
the	1
ship	1
and	1
all	1
hands	1
to	1
unconditional	1
perdition,	1
in	1
case	1
this	1
intention	1
was	1
carried	1
out.	1
So	1
strongly	1
did	1
he	1
work	1
upon	1
his	1
disciples	1
among	1
the	1
crew,	1
that	1
at	1
last	1
in	1
a	1
body	1
they	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
captain	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
if	1
Gabriel	1
was	1
sent	1
from	1
the	1
ship,	1
not	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
them	1
would	1
remain.	1
He	1
was	1
therefore	1
forced	1
to	1
relinquish	1
his	1
plan.	1
Nor	1
would	1
they	1
permit	1
Gabriel	1
to	1
be	1
any	1
way	1
maltreated,	1
say	1
or	1
do	1
what	1
he	1
would;	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Gabriel	1
had	1
the	1
complete	1
freedom	1
of	1
the	1
ship.	1
The	1
consequence	1
of	1
all	1
this	1
was,	1
that	1
the	1
archangel	1
cared	1
little	1
or	1
nothing	1
for	1
the	1
captain	1
and	1
mates;	1
and	1
since	1
the	1
epidemic	1
had	1
broken	1
out,	1
he	1
carried	1
a	1
higher	1
hand	1
than	1
ever;	1
declaring	1
that	1
the	1
plague,	1
as	1
he	1
called	1
it,	1
was	1
at	1
his	1
sole	1
command;	1
nor	1
should	1
it	1
be	1
stayed	1
but	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
good	1
pleasure.	1
The	1
sailors,	1
mostly	1
poor	1
devils,	1
cringed,	1
and	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
fawned	1
before	1
him;	1
in	1
obedience	1
to	1
his	1
instructions,	1
sometimes	1
rendering	1
him	1
personal	1
homage,	1
as	1
to	1
a	1
god.	1
Such	1
things	1
may	1
seem	1
incredible;	1
but,	1
however	1
wondrous,	1
they	1
are	1
true.	1
Nor	1
is	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
fanatics	1
half	1
so	1
striking	1
in	1
respect	1
to	1
the	1
measureless	1
self-deception	1
of	1
the	1
fanatic	1
himself,	1
as	1
his	1
measureless	1
power	1
of	1
deceiving	1
and	1
bedevilling	1
so	1
many	1
others.	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
time	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
Pequod.	1
"I	1
fear	1
not	1
thy	1
epidemic,	1
man,"	1
said	1
Ahab	1
from	1
the	1
bulwarks,	1
to	1
Captain	1
Mayhew,	1
who	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
boat's	1
stern;	1
"come	1
on	1
board."	1
But	1
now	1
Gabriel	1
started	1
to	1
his	1
feet.	1
"Think,	1
think	1
of	1
the	1
fevers,	1
yellow	1
and	1
bilious!	1
Beware	1
of	1
the	1
horrible	1
plague!"	1
"Gabriel!	1
Gabriel!"	1
cried	1
Captain	1
Mayhew;	1
"thou	1
must	1
either--"	1
But	1
that	1
instant	1
a	1
headlong	1
wave	1
shot	1
the	1
boat	1
far	1
ahead,	1
and	1
its	1
seethings	1
drowned	1
all	1
speech.	1
"Hast	1
thou	1
seen	1
the	1
White	1
Whale?"	1
demanded	1
Ahab,	1
when	1
the	1
boat	1
drifted	1
back.	1
"Think,	1
think	1
of	1
thy	1
whale-boat,	1
stoven	1
and	1
sunk!	1
Beware	1
of	1
the	1
horrible	1
tail!"	1
"I	1
tell	1
thee	1
again,	1
Gabriel,	1
that--"	1
But	1
again	1
the	1
boat	1
tore	1
ahead	1
as	1
if	1
dragged	1
by	1
fiends.	1
Nothing	1
was	1
said	1
for	1
some	1
moments,	1
while	1
a	1
succession	1
of	1
riotous	1
waves	1
rolled	1
by,	1
which	1
by	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
occasional	1
caprices	1
of	1
the	1
seas	1
were	1
tumbling,	1
not	1
heaving	1
it.	1
Meantime,	1
the	1
hoisted	1
sperm	1
whale's	1
head	1
jogged	1
about	1
very	1
violently,	1
and	1
Gabriel	1
was	1
seen	1
eyeing	1
it	1
with	1
rather	1
more	1
apprehensiveness	1
than	1
his	1
archangel	1
nature	1
seemed	1
to	1
warrant.	1
When	1
this	1
interlude	1
was	1
over,	1
Captain	1
Mayhew	1
began	1
a	1
dark	1
story	1
concerning	1
Moby	1
Dick;	1
not,	1
however,	1
without	1
frequent	1
interruptions	1
from	1
Gabriel,	1
whenever	1
his	1
name	1
was	1
mentioned,	1
and	1
the	1
crazy	1
sea	1
that	1
seemed	1
leagued	1
with	1
him.	1
It	1
seemed	1
that	1
the	1
Jeroboam	1
had	1
not	1
long	1
left	1
home,	1
when	1
upon	1
speaking	1
a	1
whale-ship,	1
her	1
people	1
were	1
reliably	1
apprised	1
of	1
the	1
existence	1
of	1
Moby	1
Dick,	1
and	1
the	1
havoc	1
he	1
had	1
made.	1
Greedily	1
sucking	1
in	1
this	1
intelligence,	1
Gabriel	1
solemnly	1
warned	1
the	1
captain	1
against	1
attacking	1
the	1
White	1
Whale,	1
in	1
case	1
the	1
monster	1
should	1
be	1
seen;	1
in	1
his	1
gibbering	1
insanity,	1
pronouncing	1
the	1
White	1
Whale	1
to	1
be	1
no	1
less	1
a	1
being	1
than	1
the	1
Shaker	1
God	1
incarnated;	1
the	1
Shakers	1
receiving	1
the	1
Bible.	1
But	1
when,	1
some	1
year	1
or	1
two	1
afterwards,	1
Moby	1
Dick	1
was	1
fairly	1
sighted	1
from	1
the	1
mast-heads,	1
Macey,	1
the	1
chief	1
mate,	1
burned	1
with	1
ardour	1
to	1
encounter	1
him;	1
and	1
the	1
captain	1
himself	1
being	1
not	1
unwilling	1
to	1
let	1
him	1
have	1
the	1
opportunity,	1
despite	1
all	1
the	1
archangel's	1
denunciations	1
and	1
forewarnings,	1
Macey	1
succeeded	1
in	1
persuading	1
five	1
men	1
to	1
man	1
his	1
boat.	1
With	1
them	1
he	1
pushed	1
off;	1
and,	1
after	1
much	1
weary	1
pulling,	1
and	1
many	1
perilous,	1
unsuccessful	1
onsets,	1
he	1
at	1
last	1
succeeded	1
in	1
getting	1
one	1
iron	1
fast.	1
Meantime,	1
Gabriel,	1
ascending	1
to	1
the	1
main-royal	1
mast-head,	1
was	1
tossing	1
one	1
arm	1
in	1
frantic	1
gestures,	1
and	1
hurling	1
forth	1
prophecies	1
of	1
speedy	1
doom	1
to	1
the	1
sacrilegious	1
assailants	1
of	1
his	1
divinity.	1
Now,	1
while	1
Macey,	1
the	1
mate,	1
was	1
standing	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
boat's	1
bow,	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
reckless	1
energy	1
of	1
his	1
tribe	1
was	1
venting	1
his	1
wild	1
exclamations	1
upon	1
the	1
whale,	1
and	1
essaying	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
fair	1
chance	1
for	1
his	1
poised	1
lance,	1
lo!	1
a	1
broad	1
white	1
shadow	1
rose	1
from	1
the	1
sea;	1
by	1
its	1
quick,	1
fanning	1
motion,	1
temporarily	1
taking	1
the	1
breath	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
bodies	1
of	1
the	1
oarsmen.	1
Next	1
instant,	1
the	1
luckless	1
mate,	1
so	1
full	1
of	1
furious	1
life,	1
was	1
smitten	1
bodily	1
into	1
the	1
air,	1
and	1
making	1
a	1
long	1
arc	1
in	1
his	1
descent,	1
fell	1
into	1
the	1
sea	1
at	1
the	1
distance	1
of	1
about	1
fifty	1
yards.	1
Not	1
a	1
chip	1
of	1
the	1
boat	1
was	1
harmed,	1
nor	1
a	1
hair	1
of	1
any	1
oarsman's	1
head;	1
but	1
the	1
mate	1
for	1
ever	1
sank.	1
It	1
is	1
well	1
to	1
parenthesize	1
here,	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
fatal	1
accidents	1
in	1
the	1
Sperm-Whale	1
Fishery,	1
this	1
kind	1
is	1
perhaps	1
almost	1
as	1
frequent	1
as	1
any.	1
Sometimes,	1
nothing	1
is	1
injured	1
but	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
is	1
thus	1
annihilated;	1
oftener	1
the	1
boat's	1
bow	1
is	1
knocked	1
off,	1
or	1
the	1
thigh-board,	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
headsman	1
stands,	1
is	1
torn	1
from	1
its	1
place	1
and	1
accompanies	1
the	1
body.	1
But	1
strangest	1
of	1
all	1
is	1
the	1
circumstance,	1
that	1
in	1
more	1
instances	1
than	1
one,	1
when	1
the	1
body	1
has	1
been	1
recovered,	1
not	1
a	1
single	1
mark	1
of	1
violence	1
is	1
discernible;	1
the	1
man	1
being	1
stark	1
dead.	1
The	1
whole	1
calamity,	1
with	1
the	1
falling	1
form	1
of	1
Macey,	1
was	1
plainly	1
descried	1
from	1
the	1
ship.	1
Raising	1
a	1
piercing	1
shriek--"The	1
vial!	1
the	1
vial!"	1
Gabriel	1
called	1
off	1
the	1
terror-stricken	1
crew	1
from	1
the	1
further	1
hunting	1
of	1
the	1
whale.	1
This	1
terrible	1
event	1
clothed	1
the	1
archangel	1
with	1
added	1
influence;	1
because	1
his	1
credulous	1
disciples	1
believed	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
specifically	1
fore-announced	1
it,	1
instead	1
of	1
only	1
making	1
a	1
general	1
prophecy,	1
which	1
any	1
one	1
might	1
have	1
done,	1
and	1
so	1
have	1
chanced	1
to	1
hit	1
one	1
of	1
many	1
marks	1
in	1
the	1
wide	1
margin	1
allowed.	1
He	1
became	1
a	1
nameless	1
terror	1
to	1
the	1
ship.	1
Mayhew	1
having	1
concluded	1
his	1
narration,	1
Ahab	1
put	1
such	1
questions	1
to	1
him,	1
that	1
the	1
stranger	1
captain	1
could	1
not	1
forbear	1
inquiring	1
whether	1
he	1
intended	1
to	1
hunt	1
the	1
White	1
Whale,	1
if	1
opportunity	1
should	1
offer.	1
To	1
which	1
Ahab	1
answered--"Aye."	1
Straightway,	1
then,	1
Gabriel	1
once	1
more	1
started	1
to	1
his	1
feet,	1
glaring	1
upon	1
the	1
old	1
man,	1
and	1
vehemently	1
exclaimed,	1
with	1
downward	1
pointed	1
finger--"Think,	1
think	1
of	1
the	1
blasphemer--dead,	1
and	1
down	1
there!--beware	1
of	1
the	1
blasphemer's	1
end!"	1
Ahab	1
stolidly	1
turned	1
aside;	1
then	1
said	1
to	1
Mayhew,	1
"Captain,	1
I	1
have	1
just	1
bethought	1
me	1
of	1
my	1
letter-bag;	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
letter	1
for	1
one	1
of	1
thy	1
officers,	1
if	1
I	1
mistake	1
not.	1
Starbuck,	1
look	1
over	1
the	1
bag."	1
Every	1
whale-ship	1
takes	1
out	1
a	1
goodly	1
number	1
of	1
letters	1
for	1
various	1
ships,	1
whose	1
delivery	1
to	1
the	1
persons	1
to	1
whom	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
addressed,	1
depends	1
upon	1
the	1
mere	1
chance	1
of	1
encountering	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
four	1
oceans.	1
Thus,	1
most	1
letters	1
never	1
reach	1
their	1
mark;	1
and	1
many	1
are	1
only	1
received	1
after	1
attaining	1
an	1
age	1
of	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
years	1
or	1
more.	1
Soon	1
Starbuck	1
returned	1
with	1
a	1
letter	1
in	1
his	1
hand.	1
It	1
was	1
sorely	1
tumbled,	1
damp,	1
and	1
covered	1
with	1
a	1
dull,	1
spotted,	1
green	1
mould,	1
in	1
consequence	1
of	1
being	1
kept	1
in	1
a	1
dark	1
locker	1
of	1
the	1
cabin.	1
Of	1
such	1
a	1
letter,	1
Death	1
himself	1
might	1
well	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
post-boy.	1
"Can'st	1
not	1
read	1
it?"	1
cried	1
Ahab.	1
"Give	1
it	1
me,	1
man.	1
Aye,	1
aye,	1
it's	1
but	1
a	1
dim	1
scrawl;--what's	1
this?"	1
As	1
he	1
was	1
studying	1
it	1
out,	1
Starbuck	1
took	1
a	1
long	1
cutting-spade	1
pole,	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
knife	1
slightly	1
split	1
the	1
end,	1
to	1
insert	1
the	1
letter	1
there,	1
and	1
in	1
that	1
way,	1
hand	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
boat,	1
without	1
its	1
coming	1
any	1
closer	1
to	1
the	1
ship.	1
Meantime,	1
Ahab	1
holding	1
the	1
letter,	1
muttered,	1
"Mr.	1
Har--yes,	1
Mr.	1
Harry--(a	1
woman's	1
pinny	1
hand,--the	1
man's	1
wife,	1
I'll	1
wager)--Aye--Mr.	1
Harry	1
Macey,	1
Ship	1
Jeroboam;--why	1
it's	1
Macey,	1
and	1
he's	1
dead!"	1
"Poor	1
fellow!	1
poor	1
fellow!	1
and	1
from	1
his	1
wife,"	1
sighed	1
Mayhew;	1
"but	1
let	1
me	1
have	1
it."	1
"Nay,	1
keep	1
it	1
thyself,"	1
cried	1
Gabriel	1
to	1
Ahab;	1
"thou	1
art	1
soon	1
going	1
that	1
way."	1
"Curses	1
throttle	1
thee!"	1
yelled	1
Ahab.	1
"Captain	1
Mayhew,	1
stand	1
by	1
now	1
to	1
receive	1
it";	1
and	1
taking	1
the	1
fatal	1
missive	1
from	1
Starbuck's	1
hands,	1
he	1
caught	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
slit	1
of	1
the	1
pole,	1
and	1
reached	1
it	1
over	1
towards	1
the	1
boat.	1
But	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
so,	1
the	1
oarsmen	1
expectantly	1
desisted	1
from	1
rowing;	1
the	1
boat	1
drifted	1
a	1
little	1
towards	1
the	1
ship's	1
stern;	1
so	1
that,	1
as	1
if	1
by	1
magic,	1
the	1
letter	1
suddenly	1
ranged	1
along	1
with	1
Gabriel's	1
eager	1
hand.	1
He	1
clutched	1
it	1
in	1
an	1
instant,	1
seized	1
the	1
boat-knife,	1
and	1
impaling	1
the	1
letter	1
on	1
it,	1
sent	1
it	1
thus	1
loaded	1
back	1
into	1
the	1
ship.	1
It	1
fell	1
at	1
Ahab's	1
feet.	1
Then	1
Gabriel	1
shrieked	1
out	1
to	1
his	1
comrades	1
to	1
give	1
way	1
with	1
their	1
oars,	1
and	1
in	1
that	1
manner	1
the	1
mutinous	1
boat	1
rapidly	1
shot	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
Pequod.	1
As,	1
after	1
this	1
interlude,	1
the	1
seamen	1
resumed	1
their	1
work	1
upon	1
the	1
jacket	1
of	1
the	1
whale,	1
many	1
strange	1
things	1
were	1
hinted	1
in	1
reference	1
to	1
this	1
wild	1
affair.	1
CHAPTER	1
72	1
The	1
Monkey-Rope.	1
In	1
the	1
tumultuous	1
business	1
of	1
cutting-in	1
and	1
attending	1
to	1
a	1
whale,	1
there	1
is	1
much	1
running	1
backwards	1
and	1
forwards	1
among	1
the	1
crew.	1
Now	1
hands	1
are	1
wanted	1
here,	1
and	1
then	1
again	1
hands	1
are	1
wanted	1
there.	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
staying	1
in	1
any	1
one	1
place;	1
for	1
at	1
one	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
everything	1
has	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
everywhere.	1
It	1
is	1
much	1
the	1
same	1
with	1
him	1
who	1
endeavors	1
the	1
description	1
of	1
the	1
scene.	1
We	1
must	1
now	1
retrace	1
our	1
way	1
a	1
little.	1
It	1
was	1
mentioned	1
that	1
upon	1
first	1
breaking	1
ground	1
in	1
the	1
whale's	1
back,	1
the	1
blubber-hook	1
was	1
inserted	1
into	1
the	1
original	1
hole	1
there	1
cut	1
by	1
the	1
spades	1
of	1
the	1
mates.	1
But	1
how	1
did	1
so	1
clumsy	1
and	1
weighty	1
a	1
mass	1
as	1
that	1
same	1
hook	1
get	1
fixed	1
in	1
that	1
hole?	1
It	1
was	1
inserted	1
there	1
by	1
my	1
particular	1
friend	1
Queequeg,	1
whose	1
duty	1
it	1
was,	1
as	1
harpooneer,	1
to	1
descend	1
upon	1
the	1
monster's	1
back	1
for	1
the	1
special	1
purpose	1
referred	1
to.	1
But	1
in	1
very	1
many	1
cases,	1
circumstances	1
require	1
that	1
the	1
harpooneer	1
shall	1
remain	1
on	1
the	1
whale	1
till	1
the	1
whole	1
tensing	1
or	1
stripping	1
operation	1
is	1
concluded.	1
The	1
whale,	1
be	1
it	1
observed,	1
lies	1
almost	1
entirely	1
submerged,	1
excepting	1
the	1
immediate	1
parts	1
operated	1
upon.	1
So	1
down	1
there,	1
some	1
ten	1
feet	1
below	1
the	1
level	1
of	1
the	1
deck,	1
the	1
poor	1
harpooneer	1
flounders	1
about,	1
half	1
on	1
the	1
whale	1
and	1
half	1
in	1
the	1
water,	1
as	1
the	1
vast	1
mass	1
revolves	1
like	1
a	1
tread-mill	1
beneath	1
him.	1
On	1
the	1
occasion	1
in	1
question,	1
Queequeg	1
figured	1
in	1
the	1
Highland	1
costume--a	1
shirt	1
and	1
socks--in	1
which	1
to	1
my	1
eyes,	1
at	1
least,	1
he	1
appeared	1
to	1
uncommon	1
advantage;	1
and	1
no	1
one	1
had	1
a	1
better	1
chance	1
to	1
observe	1
him,	1
as	1
will	1
presently	1
be	1
seen.	1
Being	1
the	1
savage's	1
bowsman,	1
that	1
is,	1
the	1
person	1
who	1
pulled	1
the	1
bow-oar	1
in	1
his	1
boat	1
(the	1
second	1
one	1
from	1
forward),	1
it	1
was	1
my	1
cheerful	1
duty	1
to	1
attend	1
upon	1
him	1
while	1
taking	1
that	1
hard-scrabble	1
scramble	1
upon	1
the	1
dead	1
whale's	1
back.	1
You	1
have	1
seen	1
Italian	1
organ-boys	1
holding	1
a	1
dancing-ape	1
by	1
a	1
long	1
cord.	1
Just	1
so,	1
from	1
the	1
ship's	1
steep	1
side,	1
did	1
I	1
hold	1
Queequeg	1
down	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
sea,	1
by	1
what	1
is	1
technically	1
called	1
in	1
the	1
fishery	1
a	1
monkey-rope,	1
attached	1
to	1
a	1
strong	1
strip	1
of	1
canvas	1
belted	1
round	1
his	1
waist.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
humorously	1
perilous	1
business	1
for	1
both	1
of	1
us.	1
For,	1
before	1
we	1
proceed	1
further,	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
said	1
that	1
the	1
monkey-rope	1
was	1
fast	1
at	1
both	1
ends;	1
fast	1
to	1
Queequeg's	1
broad	1
canvas	1
belt,	1
and	1
fast	1
to	1
my	1
narrow	1
leather	1
one.	1
So	1
that	1
for	1
better	1
or	1
for	1
worse,	1
we	1
two,	1
for	1
the	1
time,	1
were	1
wedded;	1
and	1
should	1
poor	1
Queequeg	1
sink	1
to	1
rise	1
no	1
more,	1
then	1
both	1
usage	1
and	1
honour	1
demanded,	1
that	1
instead	1
of	1
cutting	1
the	1
cord,	1
it	1
should	1
drag	1
me	1
down	1
in	1
his	1
wake.	1
So,	1
then,	1
an	1
elongated	1
Siamese	1
ligature	1
united	1
us.	1
Queequeg	1
was	1
my	1
own	1
inseparable	1
twin	1
brother;	1
nor	1
could	1
I	1
any	1
way	1
get	1
rid	1
of	1
the	1
dangerous	1
liabilities	1
which	1
the	1
hempen	1
bond	1
entailed.	1
So	1
strongly	1
and	1
metaphysically	1
did	1
I	1
conceive	1
of	1
my	1
situation	1
then,	1
that	1
while	1
earnestly	1
watching	1
his	1
motions,	1
I	1
seemed	1
distinctly	1
to	1
perceive	1
that	1
my	1
own	1
individuality	1
was	1
now	1
merged	1
in	1
a	1
joint	1
stock	1
company	1
of	1
two;	1
that	1
my	1
free	1
will	1
had	1
received	1
a	1
mortal	1
wound;	1
and	1
that	1
another's	1
mistake	1
or	1
misfortune	1
might	1
plunge	1
innocent	1
me	1
into	1
unmerited	1
disaster	1
and	1
death.	1
Therefore,	1
I	1
saw	1
that	1
here	1
was	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
interregnum	1
in	1
Providence;	1
for	1
its	1
even-handed	1
equity	1
never	1
could	1
have	1
so	1
gross	1
an	1
injustice.	1
And	1
yet	1
still	1
further	1
pondering--while	1
I	1
jerked	1
him	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
from	1
between	1
the	1
whale	1
and	1
ship,	1
which	1
would	1
threaten	1
to	1
jam	1
him--still	1
further	1
pondering,	1
I	1
say,	1
I	1
saw	1
that	1
this	1
situation	1
of	1
mine	1
was	1
the	1
precise	1
situation	1
of	1
every	1
mortal	1
that	1
breathes;	1
only,	1
in	1
most	1
cases,	1
he,	1
one	1
way	1
or	1
other,	1
has	1
this	1
Siamese	1
connexion	1
with	1
a	1
plurality	1
of	1
other	1
mortals.	1
If	1
your	1
banker	1
breaks,	1
you	1
snap;	1
if	1
your	1
apothecary	1
by	1
mistake	1
sends	1
you	1
poison	1
in	1
your	1
pills,	1
you	1
die.	1
True,	1
you	1
may	1
say	1
that,	1
by	1
exceeding	1
caution,	1
you	1
may	1
possibly	1
escape	1
these	1
and	1
the	1
multitudinous	1
other	1
evil	1
chances	1
of	1
life.	1
But	1
handle	1
Queequeg's	1
monkey-rope	1
heedfully	1
as	1
I	1
would,	1
sometimes	1
he	1
jerked	1
it	1
so,	1
that	1
I	1
came	1
very	1
near	1
sliding	1
overboard.	1
Nor	1
could	1
I	1
possibly	1
forget	1
that,	1
do	1
what	1
I	1
would,	1
I	1
only	1
had	1
the	1
management	1
of	1
one	1
end	1
of	1
it.*	1
*The	1
monkey-rope	1
is	1
found	1
in	1
all	1
whalers;	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
in	1
the	1
Pequod	1
that	1
the	1
monkey	1
and	1
his	1
holder	1
were	1
ever	1
tied	1
together.	1
This	1
improvement	1
upon	1
the	1
original	1
usage	1
was	1
introduced	1
by	1
no	1
less	1
a	1
man	1
than	1
Stubb,	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
afford	1
the	1
imperilled	1
harpooneer	1
the	1
strongest	1
possible	1
guarantee	1
for	1
the	1
faithfulness	1
and	1
vigilance	1
of	1
his	1
monkey-rope	1
holder.	1
I	1
have	1
hinted	1
that	1
I	1
would	1
often	1
jerk	1
poor	1
Queequeg	1
from	1
between	1
the	1
whale	1
and	1
the	1
ship--where	1
he	1
would	1
occasionally	1
fall,	1
from	1
the	1
incessant	1
rolling	1
and	1
swaying	1
of	1
both.	1
But	1
this	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
only	1
jamming	1
jeopardy	1
he	1
was	1
exposed	1
to.	1
Unappalled	1
by	1
the	1
massacre	1
made	1
upon	1
them	1
during	1
the	1
night,	1
the	1
sharks	1
now	1
freshly	1
and	1
more	1
keenly	1
allured	1
by	1
the	1
before	1
pent	1
blood	1
which	1
began	1
to	1
flow	1
from	1
the	1
carcass--the	1
rabid	1
creatures	1
swarmed	1
round	1
it	1
like	1
bees	1
in	1
a	1
beehive.	1
And	1
right	1
in	1
among	1
those	1
sharks	1
was	1
Queequeg;	1
who	1
often	1
pushed	1
them	1
aside	1
with	1
his	1
floundering	1
feet.	1
A	1
thing	1
altogether	1
incredible	1
were	1
it	1
not	1
that	1
attracted	1
by	1
such	1
prey	1
as	1
a	1
dead	1
whale,	1
the	1
otherwise	1
miscellaneously	1
carnivorous	1
shark	1
will	1
seldom	1
touch	1
a	1
man.	1
Nevertheless,	1
it	1
may	1
well	1
be	1
believed	1
that	1
since	1
they	1
have	1
such	1
a	1
ravenous	1
finger	1
in	1
the	1
pie,	1
it	1
is	1
deemed	1
but	1
wise	1
to	1
look	1
sharp	1
to	1
them.	1
Accordingly,	1
besides	1
the	1
monkey-rope,	1
with	1
which	1
I	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
jerked	1
the	1
poor	1
fellow	1
from	1
too	1
close	1
a	1
vicinity	1
to	1
the	1
maw	1
of	1
what	1
seemed	1
a	1
peculiarly	1
ferocious	1
shark--he	1
was	1
provided	1
with	1
still	1
another	1
protection.	1
Suspended	1
over	1
the	1
side	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
stages,	1
Tashtego	1
and	1
Daggoo	1
continually	1
flourished	1
over	1
his	1
head	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
keen	1
whale-spades,	1
wherewith	1
they	1
slaughtered	1
as	1
many	1
sharks	1
as	1
they	1
could	1
reach.	1
This	1
procedure	1
of	1
theirs,	1
to	1
be	1
sure,	1
was	1
very	1
disinterested	1
and	1
benevolent	1
of	1
them.	1
They	1
meant	1
Queequeg's	1
best	1
happiness,	1
I	1
admit;	1
but	1
in	1
their	1
hasty	1
zeal	1
to	1
befriend	1
him,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
circumstance	1
that	1
both	1
he	1
and	1
the	1
sharks	1
were	1
at	1
times	1
half	1
hidden	1
by	1
the	1
blood-muddled	1
water,	1
those	1
indiscreet	1
spades	1
of	1
theirs	1
would	1
come	1
nearer	1
amputating	1
a	1
leg	1
than	1
a	1
tall.	1
But	1
poor	1
Queequeg,	1
I	1
suppose,	1
straining	1
and	1
gasping	1
there	1
with	1
that	1
great	1
iron	1
hook--poor	1
Queequeg,	1
I	1
suppose,	1
only	1
prayed	1
to	1
his	1
Yojo,	1
and	1
gave	1
up	1
his	1
life	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
his	1
gods.	1
Well,	1
well,	1
my	1
dear	1
comrade	1
and	1
twin-brother,	1
thought	1
I,	1
as	1
I	1
drew	1
in	1
and	1
then	1
slacked	1
off	1
the	1
rope	1
to	1
every	1
swell	1
of	1
the	1
sea--what	1
matters	1
it,	1
after	1
all?	1
Are	1
you	1
not	1
the	1
precious	1
image	1
of	1
each	1
and	1
all	1
of	1
us	1
men	1
in	1
this	1
whaling	1
world?	1
That	1
unsounded	1
ocean	1
you	1
gasp	1
in,	1
is	1
Life;	1
those	1
sharks,	1
your	1
foes;	1
those	1
spades,	1
your	1
friends;	1
and	1
what	1
between	1
sharks	1
and	1
spades	1
you	1
are	1
in	1
a	1
sad	1
pickle	1
and	1
peril,	1
poor	1
lad.	1
But	1
courage!	1
there	1
is	1
good	1
cheer	1
in	1
store	1
for	1
you,	1
Queequeg.	1
For	1
now,	1
as	1
with	1
blue	1
lips	1
and	1
blood-shot	1
eyes	1
the	1
exhausted	1
savage	1
at	1
last	1
climbs	1
up	1
the	1
chains	1
and	1
stands	1
all	1
dripping	1
and	1
involuntarily	1
trembling	1
over	1
the	1
side;	1
the	1
steward	1
advances,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
benevolent,	1
consolatory	1
glance	1
hands	1
him--what?	1
Some	1
hot	1
Cognac?	1
No!	1
hands	1
him,	1
ye	1
gods!	1
hands	1
him	1
a	1
cup	1
of	1
tepid	1
ginger	1
and	1
water!	1
"Ginger?	1
Do	1
I	1
smell	1
ginger?"	1
suspiciously	1
asked	1
Stubb,	1
coming	1
near.	1
"Yes,	1
this	1
must	1
be	1
ginger,"	1
peering	1
into	1
the	1
as	1
yet	1
untasted	1
cup.	1
Then	1
standing	1
as	1
if	1
incredulous	1
for	1
a	1
while,	1
he	1
calmly	1
walked	1
towards	1
the	1
astonished	1
steward	1
slowly	1
saying,	1
"Ginger?	1
ginger?	1
and	1
will	1
you	1
have	1
the	1
goodness	1
to	1
tell	1
me,	1
Mr.	1
Dough-Boy,	1
where	1
lies	1
the	1
virtue	1
of	1
ginger?	1
Ginger!	1
is	1
ginger	1
the	1
sort	1
of	1
fuel	1
you	1
use,	1
Dough-boy,	1
to	1
kindle	1
a	1
fire	1
in	1
this	1
shivering	1
cannibal?	1
Ginger!--what	1
the	1
devil	1
is	1
ginger?--sea-coal?	1
firewood?--lucifer	1
matches?--tinder?--gunpowder?--what	1
the	1
devil	1
is	1
ginger,	1
I	1
say,	1
that	1
you	1
offer	1
this	1
cup	1
to	1
our	1
poor	1
Queequeg	1
here."	1
"There	1
is	1
some	1
sneaking	1
Temperance	1
Society	1
movement	1
about	1
this	1
business,"	1
he	1
suddenly	1
added,	1
now	1
approaching	1
Starbuck,	1
who	1
had	1
just	1
come	1
from	1
forward.	1
"Will	1
you	1
look	1
at	1
that	1
kannakin,	1
sir;	1
smell	1
of	1
it,	1
if	1
you	1
please."	1
Then	1
watching	1
the	1
mate's	1
countenance,	1
he	1
added,	1
"The	1
steward,	1
Mr.	1
Starbuck,	1
had	1
the	1
face	1
to	1
offer	1
that	1
calomel	1
and	1
jalap	1
to	1
Queequeg,	1
there,	1
this	1
instant	1
off	1
the	1
whale.	1
Is	1
the	1
steward	1
an	1
apothecary,	1
sir?	1
and	1
may	1
I	1
ask	1
whether	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
sort	1
of	1
bitters	1
by	1
which	1
he	1
blows	1
back	1
the	1
life	1
into	1
a	1
half-drowned	1
man?"	1
"I	1
trust	1
not,"	1
said	1
Starbuck,	1
"it	1
is	1
poor	1
stuff	1
enough."	1
"Aye,	1
aye,	1
steward,"	1
cried	1
Stubb,	1
"we'll	1
teach	1
you	1
to	1
drug	1
it	1
harpooneer;	1
none	1
of	1
your	1
apothecary's	1
medicine	1
here;	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
poison	1
us,	1
do	1
ye?	1
You	1
have	1
got	1
out	1
insurances	1
on	1
our	1
lives	1
and	1
want	1
to	1
murder	1
us	1
all,	1
and	1
pocket	1
the	1
proceeds,	1
do	1
ye?"	1
"It	1
was	1
not	1
me,"	1
cried	1
Dough-Boy,	1
"it	1
was	1
Aunt	1
Charity	1
that	1
brought	1
the	1
ginger	1
on	1
board;	1
and	1
bade	1
me	1
never	1
give	1
the	1
harpooneers	1
any	1
spirits,	1
but	1
only	1
this	1
ginger-jub--so	1
she	1
called	1
it."	1
"Ginger-jub!	1
you	1
gingerly	1
rascal!	1
take	1
that!	1
and	1
run	1
along	1
with	1
ye	1
to	1
the	1
lockers,	1
and	1
get	1
something	1
better.	1
I	1
hope	1
I	1
do	1
no	1
wrong,	1
Mr.	1
Starbuck.	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
captain's	1
orders--grog	1
for	1
the	1
harpooneer	1
on	1
a	1
whale."	1
"Enough,"	1
replied	1
Starbuck,	1
"only	1
don't	1
hit	1
him	1
again,	1
but--"	1
"Oh,	1
I	1
never	1
hurt	1
when	1
I	1
hit,	1
except	1
when	1
I	1
hit	1
a	1
whale	1
or	1
something	1
of	1
that	1
sort;	1
and	1
this	1
fellow's	1
a	1
weazel.	1
What	1
were	1
you	1
about	1
saying,	1
sir?"	1
"Only	1
this:	1
go	1
down	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
get	1
what	1
thou	1
wantest	1
thyself."	1
When	1
Stubb	1
reappeared,	1
he	1
came	1
with	1
a	1
dark	1
flask	1
in	1
one	1
hand,	1
and	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
tea-caddy	1
in	1
the	1
other.	1
The	1
first	1
contained	1
strong	1
spirits,	1
and	1
was	1
handed	1
to	1
Queequeg;	1
the	1
second	1
was	1
Aunt	1
Charity's	1
gift,	1
and	1
that	1
was	1
freely	1
given	1
to	1
the	1
waves.	1
CHAPTER	1
73	1
Stubb	1
and	1
Flask	1
Kill	1
a	1
Right	1
Whale;	1
and	1
Then	1
Have	1
a	1
Talk	1
Over	1
Him.	1
It	1
must	1
be	1
borne	1
in	1
mind	1
that	1
all	1
this	1
time	1
we	1
have	1
a	1
Sperm	1
Whale's	1
prodigious	1
head	1
hanging	1
to	1
the	1
Pequod's	1
side.	1
But	1
we	1
must	1
let	1
it	1
continue	1
hanging	1
there	1
a	1
while	1
till	1
we	1
can	1
get	1
a	1
chance	1
to	1
attend	1
to	1
it.	1
For	1
the	1
present	1
other	1
matters	1
press,	1
and	1
the	1
best	1
we	1
can	1
do	1
now	1
for	1
the	1
head,	1
is	1
to	1
pray	1
heaven	1
the	1
tackles	1
may	1
hold.	1
Now,	1
during	1
the	1
past	1
night	1
and	1
forenoon,	1
the	1
Pequod	1
had	1
gradually	1
drifted	1
into	1
a	1
sea,	1
which,	1
by	1
its	1
occasional	1
patches	1
of	1
yellow	1
brit,	1
gave	1
unusual	1
tokens	1
of	1
the	1
vicinity	1
of	1
Right	1
Whales,	1
a	1
species	1
of	1
the	1
Leviathan	1
that	1
but	1
few	1
supposed	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
this	1
particular	1
time	1
lurking	1
anywhere	1
near.	1
And	1
though	1
all	1
hands	1
commonly	1
disdained	1
the	1
capture	1
of	1
those	1
inferior	1
creatures;	1
and	1
though	1
the	1
Pequod	1
was	1
not	1
commissioned	1
to	1
cruise	1
for	1
them	1
at	1
all,	1
and	1
though	1
she	1
had	1
passed	1
numbers	1
of	1
them	1
near	1
the	1
Crozetts	1
without	1
lowering	1
a	1
boat;	1
yet	1
now	1
that	1
a	1
Sperm	1
Whale	1
had	1
been	1
brought	1
alongside	1
and	1
beheaded,	1
to	1
the	1
surprise	1
of	1
all,	1
the	1
announcement	1
was	1
made	1
that	1
a	1
Right	1
Whale	1
should	1
be	1
captured	1
that	1
day,	1
if	1
opportunity	1
offered.	1
Nor	1
was	1
this	1
long	1
wanting.	1
Tall	1
spouts	1
were	1
seen	1
to	1
leeward;	1
and	1
two	1
boats,	1
Stubb's	1
and	1
Flask's,	1
were	1
detached	1
in	1
pursuit.	1
Pulling	1
further	1
and	1
further	1
away,	1
they	1
at	1
last	1
became	1
almost	1
invisible	1
to	1
the	1
men	1
at	1
the	1
mast-head.	1
But	1
suddenly	1
in	1
the	1
distance,	1
they	1
saw	1
a	1
great	1
heap	1
of	1
tumultuous	1
white	1
water,	1
and	1
soon	1
after	1
news	1
came	1
from	1
aloft	1
that	1
one	1
or	1
both	1
the	1
boats	1
must	1
be	1
fast.	1
An	1
interval	1
passed	1
and	1
the	1
boats	1
were	1
in	1
plain	1
sight,	1
in	1
the	1
act	1
of	1
being	1
dragged	1
right	1
towards	1
the	1
ship	1
by	1
the	1
towing	1
whale.	1
So	1
close	1
did	1
the	1
monster	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
hull,	1
that	1
at	1
first	1
it	1
seemed	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
meant	1
it	1
malice;	1
but	1
suddenly	1
going	1
down	1
in	1
a	1
maelstrom,	1
within	1
three	1
rods	1
of	1
the	1
planks,	1
he	1
wholly	1
disappeared	1
from	1
view,	1
as	1
if	1
diving	1
under	1
the	1
keel.	1
"Cut,	1
cut!"	1
was	1
the	1
cry	1
from	1
the	1
ship	1
to	1
the	1
boats,	1
which,	1
for	1
one	1
instant,	1
seemed	1
on	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
being	1
brought	1
with	1
a	1
deadly	1
dash	1
against	1
the	1
vessel's	1
side.	1
But	1
having	1
plenty	1
of	1
line	1
yet	1
in	1
the	1
tubs,	1
and	1
the	1
whale	1
not	1
sounding	1
very	1
rapidly,	1
they	1
paid	1
out	1
abundance	1
of	1
rope,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
pulled	1
with	1
all	1
their	1
might	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
get	1
ahead	1
of	1
the	1
ship.	1
For	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
the	1
struggle	1
was	1
intensely	1
critical;	1
for	1
while	1
they	1
still	1
slacked	1
out	1
the	1
tightened	1
line	1
in	1
one	1
direction,	1
and	1
still	1
plied	1
their	1
oars	1
in	1
another,	1
the	1
contending	1
strain	1
threatened	1
to	1
take	1
them	1
under.	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
a	1
few	1
feet	1
advance	1
they	1
sought	1
to	1
gain.	1
And	1
they	1
stuck	1
to	1
it	1
till	1
they	1
did	1
gain	1
it;	1
when	1
instantly,	1
a	1
swift	1
tremor	1
was	1
felt	1
running	1
like	1
lightning	1
along	1
the	1
keel,	1
as	1
the	1
strained	1
line,	1
scraping	1
beneath	1
the	1
ship,	1
suddenly	1
rose	1
to	1
view	1
under	1
her	1
bows,	1
snapping	1
and	1
quivering;	1
and	1
so	1
flinging	1
off	1
its	1
drippings,	1
that	1
the	1
drops	1
fell	1
like	1
bits	1
of	1
broken	1
glass	1
on	1
the	1
water,	1
while	1
the	1
whale	1
beyond	1
also	1
rose	1
to	1
sight,	1
and	1
once	1
more	1
the	1
boats	1
were	1
free	1
to	1
fly.	1
But	1
the	1
fagged	1
whale	1
abated	1
his	1
speed,	1
and	1
blindly	1
altering	1
his	1
course,	1
went	1
round	1
the	1
stern	1
of	1
the	1
ship	1
towing	1
the	1
two	1
boats	1
after	1
him,	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
performed	1
a	1
complete	1
circuit.	1
Meantime,	1
they	1
hauled	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
upon	1
their	1
lines,	1
till	1
close	1
flanking	1
him	1
on	1
both	1
sides,	1
Stubb	1
answered	1
Flask	1
with	1
lance	1
for	1
lance;	1
and	1
thus	1
round	1
and	1
round	1
the	1
Pequod	1
the	1
battle	1
went,	1
while	1
the	1
multitudes	1
of	1
sharks	1
that	1
had	1
before	1
swum	1
round	1
the	1
Sperm	1
Whale's	1
body,	1
rushed	1
to	1
the	1
fresh	1
blood	1
that	1
was	1
spilled,	1
thirstily	1
drinking	1
at	1
every	1
new	1
gash,	1
as	1
the	1
eager	1
Israelites	1
did	1
at	1
the	1
new	1
bursting	1
fountains	1
that	1
poured	1
from	1
the	1
smitten	1
rock.	1
At	1
last	1
his	1
spout	1
grew	1
thick,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
frightful	1
roll	1
and	1
vomit,	1
he	1
turned	1
upon	1
his	1
back	1
a	1
corpse.	1
While	1
the	1
two	1
headsmen	1
were	1
engaged	1
in	1
making	1
fast	1
cords	1
to	1
his	1
flukes,	1
and	1
in	1
other	1
ways	1
getting	1
the	1
mass	1
in	1
readiness	1
for	1
towing,	1
some	1
conversation	1
ensued	1
between	1
them.	1
"I	1
wonder	1
what	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
wants	1
with	1
this	1
lump	1
of	1
foul	1
lard,"	1
said	1
Stubb,	1
not	1
without	1
some	1
disgust	1
at	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
having	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
so	1
ignoble	1
a	1
leviathan.	1
"Wants	1
with	1
it?"	1
said	1
Flask,	1
coiling	1
some	1
spare	1
line	1
in	1
the	1
boat's	1
bow,	1
"did	1
you	1
never	1
hear	1
that	1
the	1
ship	1
which	1
but	1
once	1
has	1
a	1
Sperm	1
Whale's	1
head	1
hoisted	1
on	1
her	1
starboard	1
side,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
a	1
Right	1
Whale's	1
on	1
the	1
larboard;	1
did	1
you	1
never	1
hear,	1
Stubb,	1
that	1
that	1
ship	1
can	1
never	1
afterwards	1
capsize?"	1
"Why	1
not?	1
"I	1
don't	1
know,	1
but	1
I	1
heard	1
that	1
gamboge	1
ghost	1
of	1
a	1
Fedallah	1
saying	1
so,	1
and	1
he	1
seems	1
to	1
know	1
all	1
about	1
ships'	1
charms.	1
But	1
I	1
sometimes	1
think	1
he'll	1
charm	1
the	1
ship	1
to	1
no	1
good	1
at	1
last.	1
I	1
don't	1
half	1
like	1
that	1
chap,	1
Stubb.	1
Did	1
you	1
ever	1
notice	1
how	1
that	1
tusk	1
of	1
his	1
is	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
carved	1
into	1
a	1
snake's	1
head,	1
Stubb?"	1
"Sink	1
him!	1
I	1
never	1
look	1
at	1
him	1
at	1
all;	1
but	1
if	1
ever	1
I	1
get	1
a	1
chance	1
of	1
a	1
dark	1
night,	1
and	1
he	1
standing	1
hard	1
by	1
the	1
bulwarks,	1
and	1
no	1
one	1
by;	1
look	1
down	1
there,	1
Flask"--pointing	1
into	1
the	1
sea	1
with	1
a	1
peculiar	1
motion	1
of	1
both	1
hands--"Aye,	1
will	1
I!	1
Flask,	1
I	1
take	1
that	1
Fedallah	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
devil	1
in	1
disguise.	1
Do	1
you	1
believe	1
that	1
cock	1
and	1
bull	1
story	1
about	1
his	1
having	1
been	1
stowed	1
away	1
on	1
board	1
ship?	1
He's	1
the	1
devil,	1
I	1
say.	1
The	1
reason	1
why	1
you	1
don't	1
see	1
his	1
tail,	1
is	1
because	1
he	1
tucks	1
it	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
sight;	1
he	1
carries	1
it	1
coiled	1
away	1
in	1
his	1
pocket,	1
I	1
guess.	1
Blast	1
him!	1
now	1
that	1
I	1
think	1
of	1
it,	1
he's	1
always	1
wanting	1
oakum	1
to	1
stuff	1
into	1
the	1
toes	1
of	1
his	1
boots."	1
"He	1
sleeps	1
in	1
his	1
boots,	1
don't	1
he?	1
He	1
hasn't	1
got	1
any	1
hammock;	1
but	1
I've	1
seen	1
him	1
lay	1
of	1
nights	1
in	1
a	1
coil	1
of	1
rigging."	1
"No	1
doubt,	1
and	1
it's	1
because	1
of	1
his	1
cursed	1
tail;	1
he	1
coils	1
it	1
down,	1
do	1
ye	1
see,	1
in	1
the	1
eye	1
of	1
the	1
rigging."	1
"What's	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
have	1
so	1
much	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
him	1
for?"	1
"Striking	1
up	1
a	1
swap	1
or	1
a	1
bargain,	1
I	1
suppose."	1
"Bargain?--about	1
what?"	1
"Why,	1
do	1
ye	1
see,	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
is	1
hard	1
bent	1
after	1
that	1
White	1
Whale,	1
and	1
the	1
devil	1
there	1
is	1
trying	1
to	1
come	1
round	1
him,	1
and	1
get	1
him	1
to	1
swap	1
away	1
his	1
silver	1
watch,	1
or	1
his	1
soul,	1
or	1
something	1
of	1
that	1
sort,	1
and	1
then	1
he'll	1
surrender	1
Moby	1
Dick."	1
"Pooh!	1
Stubb,	1
you	1
are	1
skylarking;	1
how	1
can	1
Fedallah	1
do	1
that?"	1
"I	1
don't	1
know,	1
Flask,	1
but	1
the	1
devil	1
is	1
a	1
curious	1
chap,	1
and	1
a	1
wicked	1
one,	1
I	1
tell	1
ye.	1
Why,	1
they	1
say	1
as	1
how	1
he	1
went	1
a	1
sauntering	1
into	1
the	1
old	1
flag-ship	1
once,	1
switching	1
his	1
tail	1
about	1
devilish	1
easy	1
and	1
gentlemanlike,	1
and	1
inquiring	1
if	1
the	1
old	1
governor	1
was	1
at	1
home.	1
Well,	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
home,	1
and	1
asked	1
the	1
devil	1
what	1
he	1
wanted.	1
The	1
devil,	1
switching	1
his	1
hoofs,	1
up	1
and	1
says,	1
'I	1
want	1
John.'	1
'What	1
for?'	1
says	1
the	1
old	1
governor.	1
'What	1
business	1
is	1
that	1
of	1
yours,'	1
says	1
the	1
devil,	1
getting	1
mad,--'I	1
want	1
to	1
use	1
him.'	1
'Take	1
him,'	1
says	1
the	1
governor--and	1
by	1
the	1
Lord,	1
Flask,	1
if	1
the	1
devil	1
didn't	1
give	1
John	1
the	1
Asiatic	1
cholera	1
before	1
he	1
got	1
through	1
with	1
him,	1
I'll	1
eat	1
this	1
whale	1
in	1
one	1
mouthful.	1
But	1
look	1
sharp--ain't	1
you	1
all	1
ready	1
there?	1
Well,	1
then,	1
pull	1
ahead,	1
and	1
let's	1
get	1
the	1
whale	1
alongside."	1
"I	1
think	1
I	1
remember	1
some	1
such	1
story	1
as	1
you	1
were	1
telling,"	1
said	1
Flask,	1
when	1
at	1
last	1
the	1
two	1
boats	1
were	1
slowly	1
advancing	1
with	1
their	1
burden	1
towards	1
the	1
ship,	1
"but	1
I	1
can't	1
remember	1
where."	1
"Three	1
Spaniards?	1
Adventures	1
of	1
those	1
three	1
bloody-minded	1
soladoes?	1
Did	1
ye	1
read	1
it	1
there,	1
Flask?	1
I	1
guess	1
ye	1
did?"	1
"No:	1
never	1
saw	1
such	1
a	1
book;	1
heard	1
of	1
it,	1
though.	1
But	1
now,	1
tell	1
me,	1
Stubb,	1
do	1
you	1
suppose	1
that	1
that	1
devil	1
you	1
was	1
speaking	1
of	1
just	1
now,	1
was	1
the	1
same	1
you	1
say	1
is	1
now	1
on	1
board	1
the	1
Pequod?"	1
"Am	1
I	1
the	1
same	1
man	1
that	1
helped	1
kill	1
this	1
whale?	1
Doesn't	1
the	1
devil	1
live	1
for	1
ever;	1
who	1
ever	1
heard	1
that	1
the	1
devil	1
was	1
dead?	1
Did	1
you	1
ever	1
see	1
any	1
parson	1
a	1
wearing	1
mourning	1
for	1
the	1
devil?	1
And	1
if	1
the	1
devil	1
has	1
a	1
latch-key	1
to	1
get	1
into	1
the	1
admiral's	1
cabin,	1
don't	1
you	1
suppose	1
he	1
can	1
crawl	1
into	1
a	1
porthole?	1
Tell	1
me	1
that,	1
Mr.	1
Flask?"	1
"How	1
old	1
do	1
you	1
suppose	1
Fedallah	1
is,	1
Stubb?"	1
"Do	1
you	1
see	1
that	1
mainmast	1
there?"	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
ship;	1
"well,	1
that's	1
the	1
figure	1
one;	1
now	1
take	1
all	1
the	1
hoops	1
in	1
the	1
Pequod's	1
hold,	1
and	1
string	1
along	1
in	1
a	1
row	1
with	1
that	1
mast,	1
for	1
oughts,	1
do	1
you	1
see;	1
well,	1
that	1
wouldn't	1
begin	1
to	1
be	1
Fedallah's	1
age.	1
Nor	1
all	1
the	1
coopers	1
in	1
creation	1
couldn't	1
show	1
hoops	1
enough	1
to	1
make	1
oughts	1
enough."	1
"But	1
see	1
here,	1
Stubb,	1
I	1
thought	1
you	1
a	1
little	1
boasted	1
just	1
now,	1
that	1
you	1
meant	1
to	1
give	1
Fedallah	1
a	1
sea-toss,	1
if	1
you	1
got	1
a	1
good	1
chance.	1
Now,	1
if	1
he's	1
so	1
old	1
as	1
all	1
those	1
hoops	1
of	1
yours	1
come	1
to,	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
is	1
going	1
to	1
live	1
for	1
ever,	1
what	1
good	1
will	1
it	1
do	1
to	1
pitch	1
him	1
overboard--tell	1
me	1
that?	1
"Give	1
him	1
a	1
good	1
ducking,	1
anyhow."	1
"But	1
he'd	1
crawl	1
back."	1
"Duck	1
him	1
again;	1
and	1
keep	1
ducking	1
him."	1
"Suppose	1
he	1
should	1
take	1
it	1
into	1
his	1
head	1
to	1
duck	1
you,	1
though--yes,	1
and	1
drown	1
you--what	1
then?"	1
"I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
try	1
it;	1
I'd	1
give	1
him	1
such	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
black	1
eyes	1
that	1
he	1
wouldn't	1
dare	1
to	1
show	1
his	1
face	1
in	1
the	1
admiral's	1
cabin	1
again	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
while,	1
let	1
alone	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
orlop	1
there,	1
where	1
he	1
lives,	1
and	1
hereabouts	1
on	1
the	1
upper	1
decks	1
where	1
he	1
sneaks	1
so	1
much.	1
Damn	1
the	1
devil,	1
Flask;	1
so	1
you	1
suppose	1
I'm	1
afraid	1
of	1
the	1
devil?	1
Who's	1
afraid	1
of	1
him,	1
except	1
the	1
old	1
governor	1
who	1
daresn't	1
catch	1
him	1
and	1
put	1
him	1
in	1
double-darbies,	1
as	1
he	1
deserves,	1
but	1
lets	1
him	1
go	1
about	1
kidnapping	1
people;	1
aye,	1
and	1
signed	1
a	1
bond	1
with	1
him,	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
the	1
devil	1
kidnapped,	1
he'd	1
roast	1
for	1
him?	1
There's	1
a	1
governor!"	1
"Do	1
you	1
suppose	1
Fedallah	1
wants	1
to	1
kidnap	1
Captain	1
Ahab?"	1
"Do	1
I	1
suppose	1
it?	1
You'll	1
know	1
it	1
before	1
long,	1
Flask.	1
But	1
I	1
am	1
going	1
now	1
to	1
keep	1
a	1
sharp	1
look-out	1
on	1
him;	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
see	1
anything	1
very	1
suspicious	1
going	1
on,	1
I'll	1
just	1
take	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
nape	1
of	1
his	1
neck,	1
and	1
say--Look	1
here,	1
Beelzebub,	1
you	1
don't	1
do	1
it;	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
makes	1
any	1
fuss,	1
by	1
the	1
Lord	1
I'll	1
make	1
a	1
grab	1
into	1
his	1
pocket	1
for	1
his	1
tail,	1
take	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
capstan,	1
and	1
give	1
him	1
such	1
a	1
wrenching	1
and	1
heaving,	1
that	1
his	1
tail	1
will	1
come	1
short	1
off	1
at	1
the	1
stump--do	1
you	1
see;	1
and	1
then,	1
I	1
rather	1
guess	1
when	1
he	1
finds	1
himself	1
docked	1
in	1
that	1
queer	1
fashion,	1
he'll	1
sneak	1
off	1
without	1
the	1
poor	1
satisfaction	1
of	1
feeling	1
his	1
tail	1
between	1
his	1
legs."	1
"And	1
what	1
will	1
you	1
do	1
with	1
the	1
tail,	1
Stubb?"	1
"Do	1
with	1
it?	1
Sell	1
it	1
for	1
an	1
ox	1
whip	1
when	1
we	1
get	1
home;--what	1
else?"	1
"Now,	1
do	1
you	1
mean	1
what	1
you	1
say,	1
and	1
have	1
been	1
saying	1
all	1
along,	1
Stubb?"	1
"Mean	1
or	1
not	1
mean,	1
here	1
we	1
are	1
at	1
the	1
ship."	1
The	1
boats	1
were	1
here	1
hailed,	1
to	1
tow	1
the	1
whale	1
on	1
the	1
larboard	1
side,	1
where	1
fluke	1
chains	1
and	1
other	1
necessaries	1
were	1
already	1
prepared	1
for	1
securing	1
him.	1
"Didn't	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
so?"	1
said	1
Flask;	1
"yes,	1
you'll	1
soon	1
see	1
this	1
right	1
whale's	1
head	1
hoisted	1
up	1
opposite	1
that	1
parmacetti's."	1
In	1
good	1
time,	1
Flask's	1
saying	1
proved	1
true.	1
As	1
before,	1
the	1
Pequod	1
steeply	1
leaned	1
over	1
towards	1
the	1
sperm	1
whale's	1
head,	1
now,	1
by	1
the	1
counterpoise	1
of	1
both	1
heads,	1
she	1
regained	1
her	1
even	1
keel;	1
though	1
sorely	1
strained,	1
you	1
may	1
well	1
believe.	1
So,	1
when	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
you	1
hoist	1
in	1
Locke's	1
head,	1
you	1
go	1
over	1
that	1
way;	1
but	1
now,	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side,	1
hoist	1
in	1
Kant's	1
and	1
you	1
come	1
back	1
again;	1
but	1
in	1
very	1
poor	1
plight.	1
Thus,	1
some	1
minds	1
for	1
ever	1
keep	1
trimming	1
boat.	1
Oh,	1
ye	1
foolish!	1
throw	1
all	1
these	1
thunder-heads	1
overboard,	1
and	1
then	1
you	1
will	1
float	1
light	1
and	1
right.	1
In	1
disposing	1
of	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
a	1
right	1
whale,	1
when	1
brought	1
alongside	1
the	1
ship,	1
the	1
same	1
preliminary	1
proceedings	1
commonly	1
take	1
place	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
a	1
sperm	1
whale;	1
only,	1
in	1
the	1
latter	1
instance,	1
the	1
head	1
is	1
cut	1
off	1
whole,	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
former	1
the	1
lips	1
and	1
tongue	1
are	1
separately	1
removed	1
and	1
hoisted	1
on	1
deck,	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
well	1
known	1
black	1
bone	1
attached	1
to	1
what	1
is	1
called	1
the	1
crown-piece.	1
But	1
nothing	1
like	1
this,	1
in	1
the	1
present	1
case,	1
had	1
been	1
done.	1
The	1
carcases	1
of	1
both	1
whales	1
had	1
dropped	1
astern;	1
and	1
the	1
head-laden	1
ship	1
not	1
a	1
little	1
resembled	1
a	1
mule	1
carrying	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
overburdening	1
panniers.	1
Meantime,	1
Fedallah	1
was	1
calmly	1
eyeing	1
the	1
right	1
whale's	1
head,	1
and	1
ever	1
and	1
anon	1
glancing	1
from	1
the	1
deep	1
wrinkles	1
there	1
to	1
the	1
lines	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
hand.	1
And	1
Ahab	1
chanced	1
so	1
to	1
stand,	1
that	1
the	1
Parsee	1
occupied	1
his	1
shadow;	1
while,	1
if	1
the	1
Parsee's	1
shadow	1
was	1
there	1
at	1
all	1
it	1
seemed	1
only	1
to	1
blend	1
with,	1
and	1
lengthen	1
Ahab's.	1
As	1
the	1
crew	1
toiled	1
on,	1
Laplandish	1
speculations	1
were	1
bandied	1
among	1
them,	1
concerning	1
all	1
these	1
passing	1
things.	1
CHAPTER	1
74	1
The	1
Sperm	1
Whale's	1
Head--Contrasted	1
View.	1
Here,	1
now,	1
are	1
two	1
great	1
whales,	1
laying	1
their	1
heads	1
together;	1
let	1
us	1
join	1
them,	1
and	1
lay	1
together	1
our	1
own.	1
Of	1
the	1
grand	1
order	1
of	1
folio	1
leviathans,	1
the	1
Sperm	1
Whale	1
and	1
the	1
Right	1
Whale	1
are	1
by	1
far	1
the	1
most	1
noteworthy.	1
They	1
are	1
the	1
only	1
whales	1
regularly	1
hunted	1
by	1
man.	1
To	1
the	1
Nantucketer,	1
they	1
present	1
the	1
two	1
extremes	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
known	1
varieties	1
of	1
the	1
whale.	1
As	1
the	1
external	1
difference	1
between	1
them	1
is	1
mainly	1
observable	1
in	1
their	1
heads;	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
head	1
of	1
each	1
is	1
this	1
moment	1
hanging	1
from	1
the	1
Pequod's	1
side;	1
and	1
as	1
we	1
may	1
freely	1
go	1
from	1
one	1
to	1
the	1
other,	1
by	1
merely	1
stepping	1
across	1
the	1
deck:--where,	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
know,	1
will	1
you	1
obtain	1
a	1
better	1
chance	1
to	1
study	1
practical	1
cetology	1
than	1
here?	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
place,	1
you	1
are	1
struck	1
by	1
the	1
general	1
contrast	1
between	1
these	1
heads.	1
Both	1
are	1
massive	1
enough	1
in	1
all	1
conscience;	1
but	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
certain	1
mathematical	1
symmetry	1
in	1
the	1
Sperm	1
Whale's	1
which	1
the	1
Right	1
Whale's	1
sadly	1
lacks.	1
There	1
is	1
more	1
character	1
in	1
the	1
Sperm	1
Whale's	1
head.	1
As	1
you	1
behold	1
it,	1
you	1
involuntarily	1
yield	1
the	1
immense	1
superiority	1
to	1
him,	1
in	1
point	1
of	1
pervading	1
dignity.	1
In	1
the	1
present	1
instance,	1
too,	1
this	1
dignity	1
is	1
heightened	1
by	1
the	1
pepper	1
and	1
salt	1
colour	1
of	1
his	1
head	1
at	1
the	1
summit,	1
giving	1
token	1
of	1
advanced	1
age	1
and	1
large	1
experience.	1
In	1
short,	1
he	1
is	1
what	1
the	1
fishermen	1
technically	1
call	1
a	1
"grey-headed	1
whale."	1
Let	1
us	1
now	1
note	1
what	1
is	1
least	1
dissimilar	1
in	1
these	1
heads--namely,	1
the	1
two	1
most	1
important	1
organs,	1
the	1
eye	1
and	1
the	1
ear.	1
Far	1
back	1
on	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
head,	1
and	1
low	1
down,	1
near	1
the	1
angle	1
of	1
either	1
whale's	1
jaw,	1
if	1
you	1
narrowly	1
search,	1
you	1
will	1
at	1
last	1
see	1
a	1
lashless	1
eye,	1
which	1
you	1
would	1
fancy	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
young	1
colt's	1
eye;	1
so	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
proportion	1
is	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
magnitude	1
of	1
the	1
head.	1
Now,	1
from	1
this	1
peculiar	1
sideway	1
position	1
of	1
the	1
whale's	1
eyes,	1
it	1
is	1
plain	1
that	1
he	1
can	1
never	1
see	1
an	1
object	1
which	1
is	1
exactly	1
ahead,	1
no	1
more	1
than	1
he	1
can	1
one	1
exactly	1
astern.	1
In	1
a	1
word,	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
the	1
whale's	1
eyes	1
corresponds	1
to	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
man's	1
ears;	1
and	1
you	1
may	1
fancy,	1
for	1
yourself,	1
how	1
it	1
would	1
fare	1
with	1
you,	1
did	1
you	1
sideways	1
survey	1
objects	1
through	1
your	1
ears.	1
You	1
would	1
find	1
that	1
you	1
could	1
only	1
command	1
some	1
thirty	1
degrees	1
of	1
vision	1
in	1
advance	1
of	1
the	1
straight	1
side-line	1
of	1
sight;	1
and	1
about	1
thirty	1
more	1
behind	1
it.	1
If	1
your	1
bitterest	1
foe	1
were	1
walking	1
straight	1
towards	1
you,	1
with	1
dagger	1
uplifted	1
in	1
broad	1
day,	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
see	1
him,	1
any	1
more	1
than	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
stealing	1
upon	1
you	1
from	1
behind.	1
In	1
a	1
word,	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
two	1
backs,	1
so	1
to	1
speak;	1
but,	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
also,	1
two	1
fronts	1
(side	1
fronts):	1
for	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
makes	1
the	1
front	1
of	1
a	1
man--what,	1
indeed,	1
but	1
his	1
eyes?	1
Moreover,	1
while	1
in	1
most	1
other	1
animals	1
that	1
I	1
can	1
now	1
think	1
of,	1
the	1
eyes	1
are	1
so	1
planted	1
as	1
imperceptibly	1
to	1
blend	1
their	1
visual	1
power,	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
produce	1
one	1
picture	1
and	1
not	1
two	1
to	1
the	1
brain;	1
the	1
peculiar	1
position	1
of	1
the	1
whale's	1
eyes,	1
effectually	1
divided	1
as	1
they	1
are	1
by	1
many	1
cubic	1
feet	1
of	1
solid	1
head,	1
which	1
towers	1
between	1
them	1
like	1
a	1
great	1
mountain	1
separating	1
two	1
lakes	1
in	1
valleys;	1
this,	1
of	1
course,	1
must	1
wholly	1
separate	1
the	1
impressions	1
which	1
each	1
independent	1
organ	1
imparts.	1
The	1
whale,	1
therefore,	1
must	1
see	1
one	1
distinct	1
picture	1
on	1
this	1
side,	1
and	1
another	1
distinct	1
picture	1
on	1
that	1
side;	1
while	1
all	1
between	1
must	1
be	1
profound	1
darkness	1
and	1
nothingness	1
to	1
him.	1
Man	1
may,	1
in	1
effect,	1
be	1
said	1
to	1
look	1
out	1
on	1
the	1
world	1
from	1
a	1
sentry-box	1
with	1
two	1
joined	1
sashes	1
for	1
his	1
window.	1
But	1
with	1
the	1
whale,	1
these	1
two	1
sashes	1
are	1
separately	1
inserted,	1
making	1
two	1
distinct	1
windows,	1
but	1
sadly	1
impairing	1
the	1
view.	1
This	1
peculiarity	1
of	1
the	1
whale's	1
eyes	1
is	1
a	1
thing	1
always	1
to	1
be	1
borne	1
in	1
mind	1
in	1
the	1
fishery;	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
remembered	1
by	1
the	1
reader	1
in	1
some	1
subsequent	1
scenes.	1
A	1
curious	1
and	1
most	1
puzzling	1
question	1
might	1
be	1
started	1
concerning	1
this	1
visual	1
matter	1
as	1
touching	1
the	1
Leviathan.	1
But	1
I	1
must	1
be	1
content	1
with	1
a	1
hint.	1
So	1
long	1
as	1
a	1
man's	1
eyes	1
are	1
open	1
in	1
the	1
light,	1
the	1
act	1
of	1
seeing	1
is	1
involuntary;	1
that	1
is,	1
he	1
cannot	1
then	1
help	1
mechanically	1
seeing	1
whatever	1
objects	1
are	1
before	1
him.	1
Nevertheless,	1
any	1
one's	1
experience	1
will	1
teach	1
him,	1
that	1
though	1
he	1
can	1
take	1
in	1
an	1
undiscriminating	1
sweep	1
of	1
things	1
at	1
one	1
glance,	1
it	1
is	1
quite	1
impossible	1
for	1
him,	1
attentively,	1
and	1
completely,	1
to	1
examine	1
any	1
two	1
things--however	1
large	1
or	1
however	1
small--at	1
one	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
instant	1
of	1
time;	1
never	1
mind	1
if	1
they	1
lie	1
side	1
by	1
side	1
and	1
touch	1
each	1
other.	1
But	1
if	1
you	1
now	1
come	1
to	1
separate	1
these	1
two	1
objects,	1
and	1
surround	1
each	1
by	1
a	1
circle	1
of	1
profound	1
darkness;	1
then,	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
see	1
one	1
of	1
them,	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
manner	1
as	1
to	1
bring	1
your	1
mind	1
to	1
bear	1
on	1
it,	1
the	1
other	1
will	1
be	1
utterly	1
excluded	1
from	1
your	1
contemporary	1
consciousness.	1
How	1
is	1
it,	1
then,	1
with	1
the	1
whale?	1
True,	1
both	1
his	1
eyes,	1
in	1
themselves,	1
must	1
simultaneously	1
act;	1
but	1
is	1
his	1
brain	1
so	1
much	1
more	1
comprehensive,	1
combining,	1
and	1
subtle	1
than	1
man's,	1
that	1
he	1
can	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
moment	1
of	1
time	1
attentively	1
examine	1
two	1
distinct	1
prospects,	1
one	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
in	1
an	1
exactly	1
opposite	1
direction?	1
If	1
he	1
can,	1
then	1
is	1
it	1
as	1
marvellous	1
a	1
thing	1
in	1
him,	1
as	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
were	1
able	1
simultaneously	1
to	1
go	1
through	1
the	1
demonstrations	1
of	1
two	1
distinct	1
problems	1
in	1
Euclid.	1
Nor,	1
strictly	1
investigated,	1
is	1
there	1
any	1
incongruity	1
in	1
this	1
comparison.	1
It	1
may	1
be	1
but	1
an	1
idle	1
whim,	1
but	1
it	1
has	1
always	1
seemed	1
to	1
me,	1
that	1
the	1
extraordinary	1
vacillations	1
of	1
movement	1
displayed	1
by	1
some	1
whales	1
when	1
beset	1
by	1
three	1
or	1
four	1
boats;	1
the	1
timidity	1
and	1
liability	1
to	1
queer	1
frights,	1
so	1
common	1
to	1
such	1
whales;	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
all	1
this	1
indirectly	1
proceeds	1
from	1
the	1
helpless	1
perplexity	1
of	1
volition,	1
in	1
which	1
their	1
divided	1
and	1
diametrically	1
opposite	1
powers	1
of	1
vision	1
must	1
involve	1
them.	1
But	1
the	1
ear	1
of	1
the	1
whale	1
is	1
full	1
as	1
curious	1
as	1
the	1
eye.	1
If	1
you	1
are	1
an	1
entire	1
stranger	1
to	1
their	1
race,	1
you	1
might	1
hunt	1
over	1
these	1
two	1
heads	1
for	1
hours,	1
and	1
never	1
discover	1
that	1
organ.	1
The	1
ear	1
has	1
no	1
external	1
leaf	1
whatever;	1
and	1
into	1
the	1
hole	1
itself	1
you	1
can	1
hardly	1
insert	1
a	1
quill,	1
so	1
wondrously	1
minute	1
is	1
it.	1
It	1
is	1
lodged	1
a	1
little	1
behind	1
the	1
eye.	1
With	1
respect	1
to	1
their	1
ears,	1
this	1
important	1
difference	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
observed	1
between	1
the	1
sperm	1
whale	1
and	1
the	1
right.	1
While	1
the	1
ear	1
of	1
the	1
former	1
has	1
an	1
external	1
opening,	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
latter	1
is	1
entirely	1
and	1
evenly	1
covered	1
over	1
with	1
a	1
membrane,	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
quite	1
imperceptible	1
from	1
without.	1
Is	1
it	1
not	1
curious,	1
that	1
so	1
vast	1
a	1
being	1
as	1
the	1
whale	1
should	1
see	1
the	1
world	1
through	1
so	1
small	1
an	1
eye,	1
and	1
hear	1
the	1
thunder	1
through	1
an	1
ear	1
which	1
is	1
smaller	1
than	1
a	1
hare's?	1
But	1
if	1
his	1
eyes	1
were	1
broad	1
as	1
the	1
lens	1
of	1
Herschel's	1
great	1
telescope;	1
and	1
his	1
ears	1
capacious	1
as	1
the	1
porches	1
of	1
cathedrals;	1
would	1
that	1
make	1
him	1
any	1
longer	1
of	1
sight,	1
or	1
sharper	1
of	1
hearing?	1
Not	1
at	1
all.--Why	1
then	1
do	1
you	1
try	1
to	1
"enlarge"	1
your	1
mind?	1
Subtilize	1
it.	1
Let	1
us	1
now	1
with	1
whatever	1
levers	1
and	1
steam-engines	1
we	1
have	1
at	1
hand,	1
cant	1
over	1
the	1
sperm	1
whale's	1
head,	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
lie	1
bottom	1
up;	1
then,	1
ascending	1
by	1
a	1
ladder	1
to	1
the	1
summit,	1
have	1
a	1
peep	1
down	1
the	1
mouth;	1
and	1
were	1
it	1
not	1
that	1
the	1
body	1
is	1
now	1
completely	1
separated	1
from	1
it,	1
with	1
a	1
lantern	1
we	1
might	1
descend	1
into	1
the	1
great	1
Kentucky	1
Mammoth	1
Cave	1
of	1
his	1
stomach.	1
But	1
let	1
us	1
hold	1
on	1
here	1
by	1
this	1
tooth,	1
and	1
look	1
about	1
us	1
where	1
we	1
are.	1
What	1
a	1
really	1
beautiful	1
and	1
chaste-looking	1
mouth!	1
from	1
floor	1
to	1
ceiling,	1
lined,	1
or	1
rather	1
papered	1
with	1
a	1
glistening	1
white	1
membrane,	1
glossy	1
as	1
bridal	1
satins.	1
But	1
come	1
out	1
now,	1
and	1
look	1
at	1
this	1
portentous	1
lower	1
jaw,	1
which	1
seems	1
like	1
the	1
long	1
narrow	1
lid	1
of	1
an	1
immense	1
snuff-box,	1
with	1
the	1
hinge	1
at	1
one	1
end,	1
instead	1
of	1
one	1
side.	1
If	1
you	1
pry	1
it	1
up,	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
get	1
it	1
overhead,	1
and	1
expose	1
its	1
rows	1
of	1
teeth,	1
it	1
seems	1
a	1
terrific	1
portcullis;	1
and	1
such,	1
alas!	1
it	1
proves	1
to	1
many	1
a	1
poor	1
wight	1
in	1
the	1
fishery,	1
upon	1
whom	1
these	1
spikes	1
fall	1
with	1
impaling	1
force.	1
But	1
far	1
more	1
terrible	1
is	1
it	1
to	1
behold,	1
when	1
fathoms	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
sea,	1
you	1
see	1
some	1
sulky	1
whale,	1
floating	1
there	1
suspended,	1
with	1
his	1
prodigious	1
jaw,	1
some	1
fifteen	1
feet	1
long,	1
hanging	1
straight	1
down	1
at	1
right-angles	1
with	1
his	1
body,	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
like	1
a	1
ship's	1
jib-boom.	1
This	1
whale	1
is	1
not	1
dead;	1
he	1
is	1
only	1
dispirited;	1
out	1
of	1
sorts,	1
perhaps;	1
hypochondriac;	1
and	1
so	1
supine,	1
that	1
the	1
hinges	1
of	1
his	1
jaw	1
have	1
relaxed,	1
leaving	1
him	1
there	1
in	1
that	1
ungainly	1
sort	1
of	1
plight,	1
a	1
reproach	1
to	1
all	1
his	1
tribe,	1
who	1
must,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
imprecate	1
lock-jaws	1
upon	1
him.	1
In	1
most	1
cases	1
this	1
lower	1
jaw--being	1
easily	1
unhinged	1
by	1
a	1
practised	1
artist--is	1
disengaged	1
and	1
hoisted	1
on	1
deck	1
for	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
extracting	1
the	1
ivory	1
teeth,	1
and	1
furnishing	1
a	1
supply	1
of	1
that	1
hard	1
white	1
whalebone	1
with	1
which	1
the	1
fishermen	1
fashion	1
all	1
sorts	1
of	1
curious	1
articles,	1
including	1
canes,	1
umbrella-stocks,	1
and	1
handles	1
to	1
riding-whips.	1
With	1
a	1
long,	1
weary	1
hoist	1
the	1
jaw	1
is	1
dragged	1
on	1
board,	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
an	1
anchor;	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
proper	1
time	1
comes--some	1
few	1
days	1
after	1
the	1
other	1
work--Queequeg,	1
Daggoo,	1
and	1
Tashtego,	1
being	1
all	1
accomplished	1
dentists,	1
are	1
set	1
to	1
drawing	1
teeth.	1
With	1
a	1
keen	1
cutting-spade,	1
Queequeg	1
lances	1
the	1
gums;	1
then	1
the	1
jaw	1
is	1
lashed	1
down	1
to	1
ringbolts,	1
and	1
a	1
tackle	1
being	1
rigged	1
from	1
aloft,	1
they	1
drag	1
out	1
these	1
teeth,	1
as	1
Michigan	1
oxen	1
drag	1
stumps	1
of	1
old	1
oaks	1
out	1
of	1
wild	1
wood	1
lands.	1
There	1
are	1
generally	1
forty-two	1
teeth	1
in	1
all;	1
in	1
old	1
whales,	1
much	1
worn	1
down,	1
but	1
undecayed;	1
nor	1
filled	1
after	1
our	1
artificial	1
fashion.	1
The	1
jaw	1
is	1
afterwards	1
sawn	1
into	1
slabs,	1
and	1
piled	1
away	1
like	1
joists	1
for	1
building	1
houses.	1
CHAPTER	1
75	1
The	1
Right	1
Whale's	1
Head--Contrasted	1
View.	1
Crossing	1
the	1
deck,	1
let	1
us	1
now	1
have	1
a	1
good	1
long	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
Right	1
Whale's	1
head.	1
As	1
in	1
general	1
shape	1
the	1
noble	1
Sperm	1
Whale's	1
head	1
may	1
be	1
compared	1
to	1
a	1
Roman	1
war-chariot	1
(especially	1
in	1
front,	1
where	1
it	1
is	1
so	1
broadly	1
rounded);	1
so,	1
at	1
a	1
broad	1
view,	1
the	1
Right	1
Whale's	1
head	1
bears	1
a	1
rather	1
inelegant	1
resemblance	1
to	1
a	1
gigantic	1
galliot-toed	1
shoe.	1
Two	1
hundred	1
years	1
ago	1
an	1
old	1
Dutch	1
voyager	1
likened	1
its	1
shape	1
to	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
shoemaker's	1
last.	1
And	1
in	1
this	1
same	1
last	1
or	1
shoe,	1
that	1
old	1
woman	1
of	1
the	1
nursery	1
tale,	1
with	1
the	1
swarming	1
brood,	1
might	1
very	1
comfortably	1
be	1
lodged,	1
she	1
and	1
all	1
her	1
progeny.	1
But	1
as	1
you	1
come	1
nearer	1
to	1
this	1
great	1
head	1
it	1
begins	1
to	1
assume	1
different	1
aspects,	1
according	1
to	1
your	1
point	1
of	1
view.	1
If	1
you	1
stand	1
on	1
its	1
summit	1
and	1
look	1
at	1
these	1
two	1
F-shaped	1
spoutholes,	1
you	1
would	1
take	1
the	1
whole	1
head	1
for	1
an	1
enormous	1
bass-viol,	1
and	1
these	1
spiracles,	1
the	1
apertures	1
in	1
its	1
sounding-board.	1
Then,	1
again,	1
if	1
you	1
fix	1
your	1
eye	1
upon	1
this	1
strange,	1
crested,	1
comb-like	1
incrustation	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
mass--this	1
green,	1
barnacled	1
thing,	1
which	1
the	1
Greenlanders	1
call	1
the	1
"crown,"	1
and	1
the	1
Southern	1
fishers	1
the	1
"bonnet"	1
of	1
the	1
Right	1
Whale;	1
fixing	1
your	1
eyes	1
solely	1
on	1
this,	1
you	1
would	1
take	1
the	1
head	1
for	1
the	1
trunk	1
of	1
some	1
huge	1
oak,	1
with	1
a	1
bird's	1
nest	1
in	1
its	1
crotch.	1
At	1
any	1
rate,	1
when	1
you	1
watch	1
those	1
live	1
crabs	1
that	1
nestle	1
here	1
on	1
this	1
bonnet,	1
such	1
an	1
idea	1
will	1
be	1
almost	1
sure	1
to	1
occur	1
to	1
you;	1
unless,	1
indeed,	1
your	1
fancy	1
has	1
been	1
fixed	1
by	1
the	1
technical	1
term	1
"crown"	1
also	1
bestowed	1
upon	1
it;	1
in	1
which	1
case	1
you	1
will	1
take	1
great	1
interest	1
in	1
thinking	1
how	1
this	1
mighty	1
monster	1
is	1
actually	1
a	1
diademed	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
whose	1
green	1
crown	1
has	1
been	1
put	1
together	1
for	1
him	1
in	1
this	1
marvellous	1
manner.	1
But	1
if	1
this	1
whale	1
be	1
a	1
king,	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
sulky	1
looking	1
fellow	1
to	1
grace	1
a	1
diadem.	1
Look	1
at	1
that	1
hanging	1
lower	1
lip!	1
what	1
a	1
huge	1
sulk	1
and	1
pout	1
is	1
there!	1
a	1
sulk	1
and	1
pout,	1
by	1
carpenter's	1
measurement,	1
about	1
twenty	1
feet	1
long	1
and	1
five	1
feet	1
deep;	1
a	1
sulk	1
and	1
pout	1
that	1
will	1
yield	1
you	1
some	1
500	1
gallons	1
of	1
oil	1
and	1
more.	1
A	1
great	1
pity,	1
now,	1
that	1
this	1
unfortunate	1
whale	1
should	1
be	1
hare-lipped.	1
The	1
fissure	1
is	1
about	1
a	1
foot	1
across.	1
Probably	1
the	1
mother	1
during	1
an	1
important	1
interval	1
was	1
sailing	1
down	1
the	1
Peruvian	1
coast,	1
when	1
earthquakes	1
caused	1
the	1
beach	1
to	1
gape.	1
Over	1
this	1
lip,	1
as	1
over	1
a	1
slippery	1
threshold,	1
we	1
now	1
slide	1
into	1
the	1
mouth.	1
Upon	1
my	1
word	1
were	1
I	1
at	1
Mackinaw,	1
I	1
should	1
take	1
this	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
inside	1
of	1
an	1
Indian	1
wigwam.	1
Good	1
Lord!	1
is	1
this	1
the	1
road	1
that	1
Jonah	1
went?	1
The	1
roof	1
is	1
about	1
twelve	1
feet	1
high,	1
and	1
runs	1
to	1
a	1
pretty	1
sharp	1
angle,	1
as	1
if	1
there	1
were	1
a	1
regular	1
ridge-pole	1
there;	1
while	1
these	1
ribbed,	1
arched,	1
hairy	1
sides,	1
present	1
us	1
with	1
those	1
wondrous,	1
half	1
vertical,	1
scimetar-shaped	1
slats	1
of	1
whalebone,	1
say	1
three	1
hundred	1
on	1
a	1
side,	1
which	1
depending	1
from	1
the	1
upper	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
head	1
or	1
crown	1
bone,	1
form	1
those	1
Venetian	1
blinds	1
which	1
have	1
elsewhere	1
been	1
cursorily	1
mentioned.	1
The	1
edges	1
of	1
these	1
bones	1
are	1
fringed	1
with	1
hairy	1
fibres,	1
through	1
which	1
the	1
Right	1
Whale	1
strains	1
the	1
water,	1
and	1
in	1
whose	1
intricacies	1
he	1
retains	1
the	1
small	1
fish,	1
when	1
openmouthed	1
he	1
goes	1
through	1
the	1
seas	1
of	1
brit	1
in	1
feeding	1
time.	1
In	1
the	1
central	1
blinds	1
of	1
bone,	1
as	1
they	1
stand	1
in	1
their	1
natural	1
order,	1
there	1
are	1
certain	1
curious	1
marks,	1
curves,	1
hollows,	1
and	1
ridges,	1
whereby	1
some	1
whalemen	1
calculate	1
the	1
creature's	1
age,	1
as	1
the	1
age	1
of	1
an	1
oak	1
by	1
its	1
circular	1
rings.	1
Though	1
the	1
certainty	1
of	1
this	1
criterion	1
is	1
far	1
from	1
demonstrable,	1
yet	1
it	1
has	1
the	1
savor	1
of	1
analogical	1
probability.	1
At	1
any	1
rate,	1
if	1
we	1
yield	1
to	1
it,	1
we	1
must	1
grant	1
a	1
far	1
greater	1
age	1
to	1
the	1
Right	1
Whale	1
than	1
at	1
first	1
glance	1
will	1
seem	1
reasonable.	1
In	1
old	1
times,	1
there	1
seem	1
to	1
have	1
prevailed	1
the	1
most	1
curious	1
fancies	1
concerning	1
these	1
blinds.	1
One	1
voyager	1
in	1
Purchas	1
calls	1
them	1
the	1
wondrous	1
"whiskers"	1
inside	1
of	1
the	1
whale's	1
mouth;*	1
another,	1
"hogs'	1
bristles";	1
a	1
third	1
old	1
gentleman	1
in	1
Hackluyt	1
uses	1
the	1
following	1
elegant	1
language:	1
"There	1
are	1
about	1
two	1
hundred	1
and	1
fifty	1
fins	1
growing	1
on	1
each	1
side	1
of	1
his	1
upper	1
CHOP,	1
which	1
arch	1
over	1
his	1
tongue	1
on	1
each	1
side	1
of	1
his	1
mouth."	1
*This	1
reminds	1
us	1
that	1
the	1
Right	1
Whale	1
really	1
has	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
whisker,	1
or	1
rather	1
a	1
moustache,	1
consisting	1
of	1
a	1
few	1
scattered	1
white	1
hairs	1
on	1
the	1
upper	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
outer	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
lower	1
jaw.	1
Sometimes	1
these	1
tufts	1
impart	1
a	1
rather	1
brigandish	1
expression	1
to	1
his	1
otherwise	1
solemn	1
countenance.	1
As	1
every	1
one	1
knows,	1
these	1
same	1
"hogs'	1
bristles,"	1
"fins,"	1
"whiskers,"	1
"blinds,"	1
or	1
whatever	1
you	1
please,	1
furnish	1
to	1
the	1
ladies	1
their	1
busks	1
and	1
other	1
stiffening	1
contrivances.	1
But	1
in	1
this	1
particular,	1
the	1
demand	1
has	1
long	1
been	1
on	1
the	1
decline.	1
It	1
was	1
in	1
Queen	1
Anne's	1
time	1
that	1
the	1
bone	1
was	1
in	1
its	1
glory,	1
the	1
farthingale	1
being	1
then	1
all	1
the	1
fashion.	1
And	1
as	1
those	1
ancient	1
dames	1
moved	1
about	1
gaily,	1
though	1
in	1
the	1
jaws	1
of	1
the	1
whale,	1
as	1
you	1
may	1
say;	1
even	1
so,	1
in	1
a	1
shower,	1
with	1
the	1
like	1
thoughtlessness,	1
do	1
we	1
nowadays	1
fly	1
under	1
the	1
same	1
jaws	1
for	1
protection;	1
the	1
umbrella	1
being	1
a	1
tent	1
spread	1
over	1
the	1
same	1
bone.	1
But	1
now	1
forget	1
all	1
about	1
blinds	1
and	1
whiskers	1
for	1
a	1
moment,	1
and,	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
Right	1
Whale's	1
mouth,	1
look	1
around	1
you	1
afresh.	1
Seeing	1
all	1
these	1
colonnades	1
of	1
bone	1
so	1
methodically	1
ranged	1
about,	1
would	1
you	1
not	1
think	1
you	1
were	1
inside	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
Haarlem	1
organ,	1
and	1
gazing	1
upon	1
its	1
thousand	1
pipes?	1
For	1
a	1
carpet	1
to	1
the	1
organ	1
we	1
have	1
a	1
rug	1
of	1
the	1
softest	1
Turkey--the	1
tongue,	1
which	1
is	1
glued,	1
as	1
it	1
were,	1
to	1
the	1
floor	1
of	1
the	1
mouth.	1
It	1
is	1
very	1
fat	1
and	1
tender,	1
and	1
apt	1
to	1
tear	1
in	1
pieces	1
in	1
hoisting	1
it	1
on	1
deck.	1
This	1
particular	1
tongue	1
now	1
before	1
us;	1
at	1
a	1
passing	1
glance	1
I	1
should	1
say	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
six-barreler;	1
that	1
is,	1
it	1
will	1
yield	1
you	1
about	1
that	1
amount	1
of	1
oil.	1
Ere	1
this,	1
you	1
must	1
have	1
plainly	1
seen	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
what	1
I	1
started	1
with--that	1
the	1
Sperm	1
Whale	1
and	1
the	1
Right	1
Whale	1
have	1
almost	1
entirely	1
different	1
heads.	1
To	1
sum	1
up,	1
then:	1
in	1
the	1
Right	1
Whale's	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
great	1
well	1
of	1
sperm;	1
no	1
ivory	1
teeth	1
at	1
all;	1
no	1
long,	1
slender	1
mandible	1
of	1
a	1
lower	1
jaw,	1
like	1
the	1
Sperm	1
Whale's.	1
Nor	1
in	1
the	1
Sperm	1
Whale	1
are	1
there	1
any	1
of	1
those	1
blinds	1
of	1
bone;	1
no	1
huge	1
lower	1
lip;	1
and	1
scarcely	1
anything	1
of	1
a	1
tongue.	1
Again,	1
the	1
Right	1
Whale	1
has	1
two	1
external	1
spout-holes,	1
the	1
Sperm	1
Whale	1
only	1
one.	1
Look	1
your	1
last,	1
now,	1
on	1
these	1
venerable	1
hooded	1
heads,	1
while	1
they	1
yet	1
lie	1
together;	1
for	1
one	1
will	1
soon	1
sink,	1
unrecorded,	1
in	1
the	1
sea;	1
the	1
other	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
very	1
long	1
in	1
following.	1
Can	1
you	1
catch	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
the	1
Sperm	1
Whale's	1
there?	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
same	1
he	1
died	1
with,	1
only	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
longer	1
wrinkles	1
in	1
the	1
forehead	1
seem	1
now	1
faded	1
away.	1
I	1
think	1
his	1
broad	1
brow	1
to	1
be	1
full	1
of	1
a	1
prairie-like	1
placidity,	1
born	1
of	1
a	1
speculative	1
indifference	1
as	1
to	1
death.	1
But	1
mark	1
the	1
other	1
head's	1
expression.	1
See	1
that	1
amazing	1
lower	1
lip,	1
pressed	1
by	1
accident	1
against	1
the	1
vessel's	1
side,	1
so	1
as	1
firmly	1
to	1
embrace	1
the	1
jaw.	1
Does	1
not	1
this	1
whole	1
head	1
seem	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
an	1
enormous	1
practical	1
resolution	1
in	1
facing	1
death?	1
This	1
Right	1
Whale	1
I	1
take	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
Stoic;	1
the	1
Sperm	1
Whale,	1
a	1
Platonian,	1
who	1
might	1
have	1
taken	1
up	1
Spinoza	1
in	1
his	1
latter	1
years.	1
CHAPTER	1
76	1
The	1
Battering-Ram.	1
Ere	1
quitting,	1
for	1
the	1
nonce,	1
the	1
Sperm	1
Whale's	1
head,	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
you,	1
as	1
a	1
sensible	1
physiologist,	1
simply--particularly	1
remark	1
its	1
front	1
aspect,	1
in	1
all	1
its	1
compacted	1
collectedness.	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
you	1
investigate	1
it	1
now	1
with	1
the	1
sole	1
view	1
of	1
forming	1
to	1
yourself	1
some	1
unexaggerated,	1
intelligent	1
estimate	1
of	1
whatever	1
battering-ram	1
power	1
may	1
be	1
lodged	1
there.	1
Here	1
is	1
a	1
vital	1
point;	1
for	1
you	1
must	1
either	1
satisfactorily	1
settle	1
this	1
matter	1
with	1
yourself,	1
or	1
for	1
ever	1
remain	1
an	1
infidel	1
as	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
appalling,	1
but	1
not	1
the	1
less	1
true	1
events,	1
perhaps	1
anywhere	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
all	1
recorded	1
history.	1
You	1
observe	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
ordinary	1
swimming	1
position	1
of	1
the	1
Sperm	1
Whale,	1
the	1
front	1
of	1
his	1
head	1
presents	1
an	1
almost	1
wholly	1
vertical	1
plane	1
to	1
the	1
water;	1
you	1
observe	1
that	1
the	1
lower	1
part	1
of	1
that	1
front	1
slopes	1
considerably	1
backwards,	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
furnish	1
more	1
of	1
a	1
retreat	1
for	1
the	1
long	1
socket	1
which	1
receives	1
the	1
boom-like	1
lower	1
jaw;	1
you	1
observe	1
that	1
the	1
mouth	1
is	1
entirely	1
under	1
the	1
head,	1
much	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way,	1
indeed,	1
as	1
though	1
your	1
own	1
mouth	1
were	1
entirely	1
under	1
your	1
chin.	1
Moreover	1
you	1
observe	1
that	1
the	1
whale	1
has	1
no	1
external	1
nose;	1
and	1
that	1
what	1
nose	1
he	1
has--his	1
spout	1
hole--is	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
his	1
head;	1
you	1
observe	1
that	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
ears	1
are	1
at	1
the	1
sides	1
of	1
his	1
head,	1
nearly	1
one	1
third	1
of	1
his	1
entire	1
length	1
from	1
the	1
front.	1
Wherefore,	1
you	1
must	1
now	1
have	1
perceived	1
that	1
the	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
Sperm	1
Whale's	1
head	1
is	1
a	1
dead,	1
blind	1
wall,	1
without	1
a	1
single	1
organ	1
or	1
tender	1
prominence	1
of	1
any	1
sort	1
whatsoever.	1
Furthermore,	1
you	1
are	1
now	1
to	1
consider	1
that	1
only	1
in	1
the	1
extreme,	1
lower,	1
backward	1
sloping	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
head,	1
is	1
there	1
the	1
slightest	1
vestige	1
of	1
bone;	1
and	1
not	1
till	1
you	1
get	1
near	1
twenty	1
feet	1
from	1
the	1
forehead	1
do	1
you	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
full	1
cranial	1
development.	1
So	1
that	1
this	1
whole	1
enormous	1
boneless	1
mass	1
is	1
as	1
one	1
wad.	1
Finally,	1
though,	1
as	1
will	1
soon	1
be	1
revealed,	1
its	1
contents	1
partly	1
comprise	1
the	1
most	1
delicate	1
oil;	1
yet,	1
you	1
are	1
now	1
to	1
be	1
apprised	1
of	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
substance	1
which	1
so	1
impregnably	1
invests	1
all	1
that	1
apparent	1
effeminacy.	1
In	1
some	1
previous	1
place	1
I	1
have	1
described	1
to	1
you	1
how	1
the	1
blubber	1
wraps	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
the	1
whale,	1
as	1
the	1
rind	1
wraps	1
an	1
orange.	1
Just	1
so	1
with	1
the	1
head;	1
but	1
with	1
this	1
difference:	1
about	1
the	1
head	1
this	1
envelope,	1
though	1
not	1
so	1
thick,	1
is	1
of	1
a	1
boneless	1
toughness,	1
inestimable	1
by	1
any	1
man	1
who	1
has	1
not	1
handled	1
it.	1
The	1
severest	1
pointed	1
harpoon,	1
the	1
sharpest	1
lance	1
darted	1
by	1
the	1
strongest	1
human	1
arm,	1
impotently	1
rebounds	1
from	1
it.	1
It	1
is	1
as	1
though	1
the	1
forehead	1
of	1
the	1
Sperm	1
Whale	1
were	1
paved	1
with	1
horses'	1
hoofs.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
that	1
any	1
sensation	1
lurks	1
in	1
it.	1
Bethink	1
yourself	1
also	1
of	1
another	1
thing.	1
When	1
two	1
large,	1
loaded	1
Indiamen	1
chance	1
to	1
crowd	1
and	1
crush	1
towards	1
each	1
other	1
in	1
the	1
docks,	1
what	1
do	1
the	1
sailors	1
do?	1
They	1
do	1
not	1
suspend	1
between	1
them,	1
at	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
coming	1
contact,	1
any	1
merely	1
hard	1
substance,	1
like	1
iron	1
or	1
wood.	1
No,	1
they	1
hold	1
there	1
a	1
large,	1
round	1
wad	1
of	1
tow	1
and	1
cork,	1
enveloped	1
in	1
the	1
thickest	1
and	1
toughest	1
of	1
ox-hide.	1
That	1
bravely	1
and	1
uninjured	1
takes	1
the	1
jam	1
which	1
would	1
have	1
snapped	1
all	1
their	1
oaken	1
handspikes	1
and	1
iron	1
crow-bars.	1
By	1
itself	1
this	1
sufficiently	1
illustrates	1
the	1
obvious	1
fact	1
I	1
drive	1
at.	1
But	1
supplementary	1
to	1
this,	1
it	1
has	1
hypothetically	1
occurred	1
to	1
me,	1
that	1
as	1
ordinary	1
fish	1
possess	1
what	1
is	1
called	1
a	1
swimming	1
bladder	1
in	1
them,	1
capable,	1
at	1
will,	1
of	1
distension	1
or	1
contraction;	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
Sperm	1
Whale,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
I	1
know,	1
has	1
no	1
such	1
provision	1
in	1
him;	1
considering,	1
too,	1
the	1
otherwise	1
inexplicable	1
manner	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
now	1
depresses	1
his	1
head	1
altogether	1
beneath	1
the	1
surface,	1
and	1
anon	1
swims	1
with	1
it	1
high	1
elevated	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
water;	1
considering	1
the	1
unobstructed	1
elasticity	1
of	1
its	1
envelope;	1
considering	1
the	1
unique	1
interior	1
of	1
his	1
head;	1
it	1
has	1
hypothetically	1
occurred	1
to	1
me,	1
I	1
say,	1
that	1
those	1
mystical	1
lung-celled	1
honeycombs	1
there	1
may	1
possibly	1
have	1
some	1
hitherto	1
unknown	1
and	1
unsuspected	1
connexion	1
with	1
the	1
outer	1
air,	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
susceptible	1
to	1
atmospheric	1
distension	1
and	1
contraction.	1
If	1
this	1
be	1
so,	1
fancy	1
the	1
irresistibleness	1
of	1
that	1
might,	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
most	1
impalpable	1
and	1
destructive	1
of	1
all	1
elements	1
contributes.	1
Now,	1
mark.	1
Unerringly	1
impelling	1
this	1
dead,	1
impregnable,	1
uninjurable	1
wall,	1
and	1
this	1
most	1
buoyant	1
thing	1
within;	1
there	1
swims	1
behind	1
it	1
all	1
a	1
mass	1
of	1
tremendous	1
life,	1
only	1
to	1
be	1
adequately	1
estimated	1
as	1
piled	1
wood	1
is--by	1
the	1
cord;	1
and	1
all	1
obedient	1
to	1
one	1
volition,	1
as	1
the	1
smallest	1
insect.	1
So	1
that	1
when	1
I	1
shall	1
hereafter	1
detail	1
to	1
you	1
all	1
the	1
specialities	1
and	1
concentrations	1
of	1
potency	1
everywhere	1
lurking	1
in	1
this	1
expansive	1
monster;	1
when	1
I	1
shall	1
show	1
you	1
some	1
of	1
his	1
more	1
inconsiderable	1
braining	1
feats;	1
I	1
trust	1
you	1
will	1
have	1
renounced	1
all	1
ignorant	1
incredulity,	1
and	1
be	1
ready	1
to	1
abide	1
by	1
this;	1
that	1
though	1
the	1
Sperm	1
Whale	1
stove	1
a	1
passage	1
through	1
the	1
Isthmus	1
of	1
Darien,	1
and	1
mixed	1
the	1
Atlantic	1
with	1
the	1
Pacific,	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
elevate	1
one	1
hair	1
of	1
your	1
eye-brow.	1
For	1
unless	1
you	1
own	1
the	1
whale,	1
you	1
are	1
but	1
a	1
provincial	1
and	1
sentimentalist	1
in	1
Truth.	1
But	1
clear	1
Truth	1
is	1
a	1
thing	1
for	1
salamander	1
giants	1
only	1
to	1
encounter;	1
how	1
small	1
the	1
chances	1
for	1
the	1
provincials	1
then?	1
What	1
befell	1
the	1
weakling	1
youth	1
lifting	1
the	1
dread	1
goddess's	1
veil	1
at	1
Lais?	1
CHAPTER	1
77	1
The	1
Great	1
Heidelburgh	1
Tun.	1
Now	1
comes	1
the	1
Baling	1
of	1
the	1
Case.	1
But	1
to	1
comprehend	1
it	1
aright,	1
you	1
must	1
know	1
something	1
of	1
the	1
curious	1
internal	1
structure	1
of	1
the	1
thing	1
operated	1
upon.	1
Regarding	1
the	1
Sperm	1
Whale's	1
head	1
as	1
a	1
solid	1
oblong,	1
you	1
may,	1
on	1
an	1
inclined	1
plane,	1
sideways	1
divide	1
it	1
into	1
two	1
quoins,*	1
whereof	1
the	1
lower	1
is	1
the	1
bony	1
structure,	1
forming	1
the	1
cranium	1
and	1
jaws,	1
and	1
the	1
upper	1
an	1
unctuous	1
mass	1
wholly	1
free	1
from	1
bones;	1
its	1
broad	1
forward	1
end	1
forming	1
the	1
expanded	1
vertical	1
apparent	1
forehead	1
of	1
the	1
whale.	1
At	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
forehead	1
horizontally	1
subdivide	1
this	1
upper	1
quoin,	1
and	1
then	1
you	1
have	1
two	1
almost	1
equal	1
parts,	1
which	1
before	1
were	1
naturally	1
divided	1
by	1
an	1
internal	1
wall	1
of	1
a	1
thick	1
tendinous	1
substance.	1
*Quoin	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
Euclidean	1
term.	1
It	1
belongs	1
to	1
the	1
pure	1
nautical	1
mathematics.	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
that	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
defined	1
before.	1
A	1
quoin	1
is	1
a	1
solid	1
which	1
differs	1
from	1
a	1
wedge	1
in	1
having	1
its	1
sharp	1
end	1
formed	1
by	1
the	1
steep	1
inclination	1
of	1
one	1
side,	1
instead	1
of	1
the	1
mutual	1
tapering	1
of	1
both	1
sides.	1
The	1
lower	1
subdivided	1
part,	1
called	1
the	1
junk,	1
is	1
one	1
immense	1
honeycomb	1
of	1
oil,	1
formed	1
by	1
the	1
crossing	1
and	1
recrossing,	1
into	1
ten	1
thousand	1
infiltrated	1
cells,	1
of	1
tough	1
elastic	1
white	1
fibres	1
throughout	1
its	1
whole	1
extent.	1
The	1
upper	1
part,	1
known	1
as	1
the	1
Case,	1
may	1
be	1
regarded	1
as	1
the	1
great	1
Heidelburgh	1
Tun	1
of	1
the	1
Sperm	1
Whale.	1
And	1
as	1
that	1
famous	1
great	1
tierce	1
is	1
mystically	1
carved	1
in	1
front,	1
so	1
the	1
whale's	1
vast	1
plaited	1
forehead	1
forms	1
innumerable	1
strange	1
devices	1
for	1
the	1
emblematical	1
adornment	1
of	1
his	1
wondrous	1
tun.	1
Moreover,	1
as	1
that	1
of	1
Heidelburgh	1
was	1
always	1
replenished	1
with	1
the	1
most	1
excellent	1
of	1
the	1
wines	1
of	1
the	1
Rhenish	1
valleys,	1
so	1
the	1
tun	1
of	1
the	1
whale	1
contains	1
by	1
far	1
the	1
most	1
precious	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
oily	1
vintages;	1
namely,	1
the	1
highly-prized	1
spermaceti,	1
in	1
its	1
absolutely	1
pure,	1
limpid,	1
and	1
odoriferous	1
state.	1
Nor	1
is	1
this	1
precious	1
substance	1
found	1
unalloyed	1
in	1
any	1
other	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
creature.	1
Though	1
in	1
life	1
it	1
remains	1
perfectly	1
fluid,	1
yet,	1
upon	1
exposure	1
to	1
the	1
air,	1
after	1
death,	1
it	1
soon	1
begins	1
to	1
concrete;	1
sending	1
forth	1
beautiful	1
crystalline	1
shoots,	1
as	1
when	1
the	1
first	1
thin	1
delicate	1
ice	1
is	1
just	1
forming	1
in	1
water.	1
A	1
large	1
whale's	1
case	1
generally	1
yields	1
about	1
five	1
hundred	1
gallons	1
of	1
sperm,	1
though	1
from	1
unavoidable	1
circumstances,	1
considerable	1
of	1
it	1
is	1
spilled,	1
leaks,	1
and	1
dribbles	1
away,	1
or	1
is	1
otherwise	1
irrevocably	1
lost	1
in	1
the	1
ticklish	1
business	1
of	1
securing	1
what	1
you	1
can.	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
with	1
what	1
fine	1
and	1
costly	1
material	1
the	1
Heidelburgh	1
Tun	1
was	1
coated	1
within,	1
but	1
in	1
superlative	1
richness	1
that	1
coating	1
could	1
not	1
possibly	1
have	1
compared	1
with	1
the	1
silken	1
pearl-coloured	1
membrane,	1
like	1
the	1
lining	1
of	1
a	1
fine	1
pelisse,	1
forming	1
the	1
inner	1
surface	1
of	1
the	1
Sperm	1
Whale's	1
case.	1
It	1
will	1
have	1
been	1
seen	1
that	1
the	1
Heidelburgh	1
Tun	1
of	1
the	1
Sperm	1
Whale	1
embraces	1
the	1
entire	1
length	1
of	1
the	1
entire	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
head;	1
and	1
since--as	1
has	1
been	1
elsewhere	1
set	1
forth--the	1
head	1
embraces	1
one	1
third	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
length	1
of	1
the	1
creature,	1
then	1
setting	1
that	1
length	1
down	1
at	1
eighty	1
feet	1
for	1
a	1
good	1
sized	1
whale,	1
you	1
have	1
more	1
than	1
twenty-six	1
feet	1
for	1
the	1
depth	1
of	1
the	1
tun,	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
lengthwise	1
hoisted	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
against	1
a	1
ship's	1
side.	1
As	1
in	1
decapitating	1
the	1
whale,	1
the	1
operator's	1
instrument	1
is	1
brought	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
spot	1
where	1
an	1
entrance	1
is	1
subsequently	1
forced	1
into	1
the	1
spermaceti	1
magazine;	1
he	1
has,	1
therefore,	1
to	1
be	1
uncommonly	1
heedful,	1
lest	1
a	1
careless,	1
untimely	1
stroke	1
should	1
invade	1
the	1
sanctuary	1
and	1
wastingly	1
let	1
out	1
its	1
invaluable	1
contents.	1
It	1
is	1
this	1
decapitated	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
head,	1
also,	1
which	1
is	1
at	1
last	1
elevated	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
water,	1
and	1
retained	1
in	1
that	1
position	1
by	1
the	1
enormous	1
cutting	1
tackles,	1
whose	1
hempen	1
combinations,	1
on	1
one	1
side,	1
make	1
quite	1
a	1
wilderness	1
of	1
ropes	1
in	1
that	1
quarter.	1
Thus	1
much	1
being	1
said,	1
attend	1
now,	1
I	1
pray	1
you,	1
to	1
that	1
marvellous	1
and--in	1
this	1
particular	1
instance--almost	1
fatal	1
operation	1
whereby	1
the	1
Sperm	1
Whale's	1
great	1
Heidelburgh	1
Tun	1
is	1
tapped.	1
CHAPTER	1
78	1
Cistern	1
and	1
Buckets.	1
Nimble	1
as	1
a	1
cat,	1
Tashtego	1
mounts	1
aloft;	1
and	1
without	1
altering	1
his	1
erect	1
posture,	1
runs	1
straight	1
out	1
upon	1
the	1
overhanging	1
mainyard-arm,	1
to	1
the	1
part	1
where	1
it	1
exactly	1
projects	1
over	1
the	1
hoisted	1
Tun.	1
He	1
has	1
carried	1
with	1
him	1
a	1
light	1
tackle	1
called	1
a	1
whip,	1
consisting	1
of	1
only	1
two	1
parts,	1
travelling	1
through	1
a	1
single-sheaved	1
block.	1
Securing	1
this	1
block,	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
hangs	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
yard-arm,	1
he	1
swings	1
one	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
rope,	1
till	1
it	1
is	1
caught	1
and	1
firmly	1
held	1
by	1
a	1
hand	1
on	1
deck.	1
Then,	1
hand-over-hand,	1
down	1
the	1
other	1
part,	1
the	1
Indian	1
drops	1
through	1
the	1
air,	1
till	1
dexterously	1
he	1
lands	1
on	1
the	1
summit	1
of	1
the	1
head.	1
There--still	1
high	1
elevated	1
above	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
company,	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
vivaciously	1
cries--he	1
seems	1
some	1
Turkish	1
Muezzin	1
calling	1
the	1
good	1
people	1
to	1
prayers	1
from	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
a	1
tower.	1
A	1
short-handled	1
sharp	1
spade	1
being	1
sent	1
up	1
to	1
him,	1
he	1
diligently	1
searches	1
for	1
the	1
proper	1
place	1
to	1
begin	1
breaking	1
into	1
the	1
Tun.	1
In	1
this	1
business	1
he	1
proceeds	1
very	1
heedfully,	1
like	1
a	1
treasure-hunter	1
in	1
some	1
old	1
house,	1
sounding	1
the	1
walls	1
to	1
find	1
where	1
the	1
gold	1
is	1
masoned	1
in.	1
By	1
the	1
time	1
this	1
cautious	1
search	1
is	1
over,	1
a	1
stout	1
iron-bound	1
bucket,	1
precisely	1
like	1
a	1
well-bucket,	1
has	1
been	1
attached	1
to	1
one	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
whip;	1
while	1
the	1
other	1
end,	1
being	1
stretched	1
across	1
the	1
deck,	1
is	1
there	1
held	1
by	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
alert	1
hands.	1
These	1
last	1
now	1
hoist	1
the	1
bucket	1
within	1
grasp	1
of	1
the	1
Indian,	1
to	1
whom	1
another	1
person	1
has	1
reached	1
up	1
a	1
very	1
long	1
pole.	1
Inserting	1
this	1
pole	1
into	1
the	1
bucket,	1
Tashtego	1
downward	1
guides	1
the	1
bucket	1
into	1
the	1
Tun,	1
till	1
it	1
entirely	1
disappears;	1
then	1
giving	1
the	1
word	1
to	1
the	1
seamen	1
at	1
the	1
whip,	1
up	1
comes	1
the	1
bucket	1
again,	1
all	1
bubbling	1
like	1
a	1
dairy-maid's	1
pail	1
of	1
new	1
milk.	1
Carefully	1
lowered	1
from	1
its	1
height,	1
the	1
full-freighted	1
vessel	1
is	1
caught	1
by	1
an	1
appointed	1
hand,	1
and	1
quickly	1
emptied	1
into	1
a	1
large	1
tub.	1
Then	1
remounting	1
aloft,	1
it	1
again	1
goes	1
through	1
the	1
same	1
round	1
until	1
the	1
deep	1
cistern	1
will	1
yield	1
no	1
more.	1
Towards	1
the	1
end,	1
Tashtego	1
has	1
to	1
ram	1
his	1
long	1
pole	1
harder	1
and	1
harder,	1
and	1
deeper	1
and	1
deeper	1
into	1
the	1
Tun,	1
until	1
some	1
twenty	1
feet	1
of	1
the	1
pole	1
have	1
gone	1
down.	1
Now,	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
Pequod	1
had	1
been	1
baling	1
some	1
time	1
in	1
this	1
way;	1
several	1
tubs	1
had	1
been	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
fragrant	1
sperm;	1
when	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
a	1
queer	1
accident	1
happened.	1
Whether	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
Tashtego,	1
that	1
wild	1
Indian,	1
was	1
so	1
heedless	1
and	1
reckless	1
as	1
to	1
let	1
go	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
his	1
one-handed	1
hold	1
on	1
the	1
great	1
cabled	1
tackles	1
suspending	1
the	1
head;	1
or	1
whether	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
he	1
stood	1
was	1
so	1
treacherous	1
and	1
oozy;	1
or	1
whether	1
the	1
Evil	1
One	1
himself	1
would	1
have	1
it	1
to	1
fall	1
out	1
so,	1
without	1
stating	1
his	1
particular	1
reasons;	1
how	1
it	1
was	1
exactly,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
telling	1
now;	1
but,	1
on	1
a	1
sudden,	1
as	1
the	1
eightieth	1
or	1
ninetieth	1
bucket	1
came	1
suckingly	1
up--my	1
God!	1
poor	1
Tashtego--like	1
the	1
twin	1
reciprocating	1
bucket	1
in	1
a	1
veritable	1
well,	1
dropped	1
head-foremost	1
down	1
into	1
this	1
great	1
Tun	1
of	1
Heidelburgh,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
horrible	1
oily	1
gurgling,	1
went	1
clean	1
out	1
of	1
sight!	1
"Man	1
overboard!"	1
cried	1
Daggoo,	1
who	1
amid	1
the	1
general	1
consternation	1
first	1
came	1
to	1
his	1
senses.	1
"Swing	1
the	1
bucket	1
this	1
way!"	1
and	1
putting	1
one	1
foot	1
into	1
it,	1
so	1
as	1
the	1
better	1
to	1
secure	1
his	1
slippery	1
hand-hold	1
on	1
the	1
whip	1
itself,	1
the	1
hoisters	1
ran	1
him	1
high	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
head,	1
almost	1
before	1
Tashtego	1
could	1
have	1
reached	1
its	1
interior	1
bottom.	1
Meantime,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
terrible	1
tumult.	1
Looking	1
over	1
the	1
side,	1
they	1
saw	1
the	1
before	1
lifeless	1
head	1
throbbing	1
and	1
heaving	1
just	1
below	1
the	1
surface	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
as	1
if	1
that	1
moment	1
seized	1
with	1
some	1
momentous	1
idea;	1
whereas	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
the	1
poor	1
Indian	1
unconsciously	1
revealing	1
by	1
those	1
struggles	1
the	1
perilous	1
depth	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
sunk.	1
At	1
this	1
instant,	1
while	1
Daggoo,	1
on	1
the	1
summit	1
of	1
the	1
head,	1
was	1
clearing	1
the	1
whip--which	1
had	1
somehow	1
got	1
foul	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
cutting	1
tackles--a	1
sharp	1
cracking	1
noise	1
was	1
heard;	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
unspeakable	1
horror	1
of	1
all,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
enormous	1
hooks	1
suspending	1
the	1
head	1
tore	1
out,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
vast	1
vibration	1
the	1
enormous	1
mass	1
sideways	1
swung,	1
till	1
the	1
drunk	1
ship	1
reeled	1
and	1
shook	1
as	1
if	1
smitten	1
by	1
an	1
iceberg.	1
The	1
one	1
remaining	1
hook,	1
upon	1
which	1
the	1
entire	1
strain	1
now	1
depended,	1
seemed	1
every	1
instant	1
to	1
be	1
on	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
giving	1
way;	1
an	1
event	1
still	1
more	1
likely	1
from	1
the	1
violent	1
motions	1
of	1
the	1
head.	1
"Come	1
down,	1
come	1
down!"	1
yelled	1
the	1
seamen	1
to	1
Daggoo,	1
but	1
with	1
one	1
hand	1
holding	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
heavy	1
tackles,	1
so	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
head	1
should	1
drop,	1
he	1
would	1
still	1
remain	1
suspended;	1
the	1
negro	1
having	1
cleared	1
the	1
foul	1
line,	1
rammed	1
down	1
the	1
bucket	1
into	1
the	1
now	1
collapsed	1
well,	1
meaning	1
that	1
the	1
buried	1
harpooneer	1
should	1
grasp	1
it,	1
and	1
so	1
be	1
hoisted	1
out.	1
"In	1
heaven's	1
name,	1
man,"	1
cried	1
Stubb,	1
"are	1
you	1
ramming	1
home	1
a	1
cartridge	1
there?--Avast!	1
How	1
will	1
that	1
help	1
him;	1
jamming	1
that	1
iron-bound	1
bucket	1
on	1
top	1
of	1
his	1
head?	1
Avast,	1
will	1
ye!"	1
"Stand	1
clear	1
of	1
the	1
tackle!"	1
cried	1
a	1
voice	1
like	1
the	1
bursting	1
of	1
a	1
rocket.	1
Almost	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
instant,	1
with	1
a	1
thunder-boom,	1
the	1
enormous	1
mass	1
dropped	1
into	1
the	1
sea,	1
like	1
Niagara's	1
Table-Rock	1
into	1
the	1
whirlpool;	1
the	1
suddenly	1
relieved	1
hull	1
rolled	1
away	1
from	1
it,	1
to	1
far	1
down	1
her	1
glittering	1
copper;	1
and	1
all	1
caught	1
their	1
breath,	1
as	1
half	1
swinging--now	1
over	1
the	1
sailors'	1
heads,	1
and	1
now	1
over	1
the	1
water--Daggoo,	1
through	1
a	1
thick	1
mist	1
of	1
spray,	1
was	1
dimly	1
beheld	1
clinging	1
to	1
the	1
pendulous	1
tackles,	1
while	1
poor,	1
buried-alive	1
Tashtego	1
was	1
sinking	1
utterly	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
sea!	1
But	1
hardly	1
had	1
the	1
blinding	1
vapour	1
cleared	1
away,	1
when	1
a	1
naked	1
figure	1
with	1
a	1
boarding-sword	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
was	1
for	1
one	1
swift	1
moment	1
seen	1
hovering	1
over	1
the	1
bulwarks.	1
The	1
next,	1
a	1
loud	1
splash	1
announced	1
that	1
my	1
brave	1
Queequeg	1
had	1
dived	1
to	1
the	1
rescue.	1
One	1
packed	1
rush	1
was	1
made	1
to	1
the	1
side,	1
and	1
every	1
eye	1
counted	1
every	1
ripple,	1
as	1
moment	1
followed	1
moment,	1
and	1
no	1
sign	1
of	1
either	1
the	1
sinker	1
or	1
the	1
diver	1
could	1
be	1
seen.	1
Some	1
hands	1
now	1
jumped	1
into	1
a	1
boat	1
alongside,	1
and	1
pushed	1
a	1
little	1
off	1
from	1
the	1
ship.	1
"Ha!	1
ha!"	1
cried	1
Daggoo,	1
all	1
at	1
once,	1
from	1
his	1
now	1
quiet,	1
swinging	1
perch	1
overhead;	1
and	1
looking	1
further	1
off	1
from	1
the	1
side,	1
we	1
saw	1
an	1
arm	1
thrust	1
upright	1
from	1
the	1
blue	1
waves;	1
a	1
sight	1
strange	1
to	1
see,	1
as	1
an	1
arm	1
thrust	1
forth	1
from	1
the	1
grass	1
over	1
a	1
grave.	1
"Both!	1
both!--it	1
is	1
both!"--cried	1
Daggoo	1
again	1
with	1
a	1
joyful	1
shout;	1
and	1
soon	1
after,	1
Queequeg	1
was	1
seen	1
boldly	1
striking	1
out	1
with	1
one	1
hand,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
other	1
clutching	1
the	1
long	1
hair	1
of	1
the	1
Indian.	1
Drawn	1
into	1
the	1
waiting	1
boat,	1
they	1
were	1
quickly	1
brought	1
to	1
the	1
deck;	1
but	1
Tashtego	1
was	1
long	1
in	1
coming	1
to,	1
and	1
Queequeg	1
did	1
not	1
look	1
very	1
brisk.	1
Now,	1
how	1
had	1
this	1
noble	1
rescue	1
been	1
accomplished?	1
Why,	1
diving	1
after	1
the	1
slowly	1
descending	1
head,	1
Queequeg	1
with	1
his	1
keen	1
sword	1
had	1
made	1
side	1
lunges	1
near	1
its	1
bottom,	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
scuttle	1
a	1
large	1
hole	1
there;	1
then	1
dropping	1
his	1
sword,	1
had	1
thrust	1
his	1
long	1
arm	1
far	1
inwards	1
and	1
upwards,	1
and	1
so	1
hauled	1
out	1
poor	1
Tash	1
by	1
the	1
head.	1
He	1
averred,	1
that	1
upon	1
first	1
thrusting	1
in	1
for	1
him,	1
a	1
leg	1
was	1
presented;	1
but	1
well	1
knowing	1
that	1
that	1
was	1
not	1
as	1
it	1
ought	1
to	1
be,	1
and	1
might	1
occasion	1
great	1
trouble;--he	1
had	1
thrust	1
back	1
the	1
leg,	1
and	1
by	1
a	1
dexterous	1
heave	1
and	1
toss,	1
had	1
wrought	1
a	1
somerset	1
upon	1
the	1
Indian;	1
so	1
that	1
with	1
the	1
next	1
trial,	1
he	1
came	1
forth	1
in	1
the	1
good	1
old	1
way--head	1
foremost.	1
As	1
for	1
the	1
great	1
head	1
itself,	1
that	1
was	1
doing	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
could	1
be	1
expected.	1
And	1
thus,	1
through	1
the	1
courage	1
and	1
great	1
skill	1
in	1
obstetrics	1
of	1
Queequeg,	1
the	1
deliverance,	1
or	1
rather,	1
delivery	1
of	1
Tashtego,	1
was	1
successfully	1
accomplished,	1
in	1
the	1
teeth,	1
too,	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
untoward	1
and	1
apparently	1
hopeless	1
impediments;	1
which	1
is	1
a	1
lesson	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
to	1
be	1
forgotten.	1
Midwifery	1
should	1
be	1
taught	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
course	1
with	1
fencing	1
and	1
boxing,	1
riding	1
and	1
rowing.	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
this	1
queer	1
adventure	1
of	1
the	1
Gay-Header's	1
will	1
be	1
sure	1
to	1
seem	1
incredible	1
to	1
some	1
landsmen,	1
though	1
they	1
themselves	1
may	1
have	1
either	1
seen	1
or	1
heard	1
of	1
some	1
one's	1
falling	1
into	1
a	1
cistern	1
ashore;	1
an	1
accident	1
which	1
not	1
seldom	1
happens,	1
and	1
with	1
much	1
less	1
reason	1
too	1
than	1
the	1
Indian's,	1
considering	1
the	1
exceeding	1
slipperiness	1
of	1
the	1
curb	1
of	1
the	1
Sperm	1
Whale's	1
well.	1
But,	1
peradventure,	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
sagaciously	1
urged,	1
how	1
is	1
this?	1
We	1
thought	1
the	1
tissued,	1
infiltrated	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
Sperm	1
Whale,	1
was	1
the	1
lightest	1
and	1
most	1
corky	1
part	1
about	1
him;	1
and	1
yet	1
thou	1
makest	1
it	1
sink	1
in	1
an	1
element	1
of	1
a	1
far	1
greater	1
specific	1
gravity	1
than	1
itself.	1
We	1
have	1
thee	1
there.	1
Not	1
at	1
all,	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
ye;	1
for	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
poor	1
Tash	1
fell	1
in,	1
the	1
case	1
had	1
been	1
nearly	1
emptied	1
of	1
its	1
lighter	1
contents,	1
leaving	1
little	1
but	1
the	1
dense	1
tendinous	1
wall	1
of	1
the	1
well--a	1
double	1
welded,	1
hammered	1
substance,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
before	1
said,	1
much	1
heavier	1
than	1
the	1
sea	1
water,	1
and	1
a	1
lump	1
of	1
which	1
sinks	1
in	1
it	1
like	1
lead	1
almost.	1
But	1
the	1
tendency	1
to	1
rapid	1
sinking	1
in	1
this	1
substance	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
present	1
instance	1
materially	1
counteracted	1
by	1
the	1
other	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
head	1
remaining	1
undetached	1
from	1
it,	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
sank	1
very	1
slowly	1
and	1
deliberately	1
indeed,	1
affording	1
Queequeg	1
a	1
fair	1
chance	1
for	1
performing	1
his	1
agile	1
obstetrics	1
on	1
the	1
run,	1
as	1
you	1
may	1
say.	1
Yes,	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
running	1
delivery,	1
so	1
it	1
was.	1
Now,	1
had	1
Tashtego	1
perished	1
in	1
that	1
head,	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
very	1
precious	1
perishing;	1
smothered	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
whitest	1
and	1
daintiest	1
of	1
fragrant	1
spermaceti;	1
coffined,	1
hearsed,	1
and	1
tombed	1
in	1
the	1
secret	1
inner	1
chamber	1
and	1
sanctum	1
sanctorum	1
of	1
the	1
whale.	1
Only	1
one	1
sweeter	1
end	1
can	1
readily	1
be	1
recalled--the	1
delicious	1
death	1
of	1
an	1
Ohio	1
honey-hunter,	1
who	1
seeking	1
honey	1
in	1
the	1
crotch	1
of	1
a	1
hollow	1
tree,	1
found	1
such	1
exceeding	1
store	1
of	1
it,	1
that	1
leaning	1
too	1
far	1
over,	1
it	1
sucked	1
him	1
in,	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
died	1
embalmed.	1
How	1
many,	1
think	1
ye,	1
have	1
likewise	1
fallen	1
into	1
Plato's	1
honey	1
head,	1
and	1
sweetly	1
perished	1
there?	1
CHAPTER	1
79	1
The	1
Prairie.	1
To	1
scan	1
the	1
lines	1
of	1
his	1
face,	1
or	1
feel	1
the	1
bumps	1
on	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
this	1
Leviathan;	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
thing	1
which	1
no	1
Physiognomist	1
or	1
Phrenologist	1
has	1
as	1
yet	1
undertaken.	1
Such	1
an	1
enterprise	1
would	1
seem	1
almost	1
as	1
hopeful	1
as	1
for	1
Lavater	1
to	1
have	1
scrutinized	1
the	1
wrinkles	1
on	1
the	1
Rock	1
of	1
Gibraltar,	1
or	1
for	1
Gall	1
to	1
have	1
mounted	1
a	1
ladder	1
and	1
manipulated	1
the	1
Dome	1
of	1
the	1
Pantheon.	1
Still,	1
in	1
that	1
famous	1
work	1
of	1
his,	1
Lavater	1
not	1
only	1
treats	1
of	1
the	1
various	1
faces	1
of	1
men,	1
but	1
also	1
attentively	1
studies	1
the	1
faces	1
of	1
horses,	1
birds,	1
serpents,	1
and	1
fish;	1
and	1
dwells	1
in	1
detail	1
upon	1
the	1
modifications	1
of	1
expression	1
discernible	1
therein.	1
Nor	1
have	1
Gall	1
and	1
his	1
disciple	1
Spurzheim	1
failed	1
to	1
throw	1
out	1
some	1
hints	1
touching	1
the	1
phrenological	1
characteristics	1
of	1
other	1
beings	1
than	1
man.	1
Therefore,	1
though	1
I	1
am	1
but	1
ill	1
qualified	1
for	1
a	1
pioneer,	1
in	1
the	1
application	1
of	1
these	1
two	1
semi-sciences	1
to	1
the	1
whale,	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
my	1
endeavor.	1
I	1
try	1
all	1
things;	1
I	1
achieve	1
what	1
I	1
can.	1
Physiognomically	1
regarded,	1
the	1
Sperm	1
Whale	1
is	1
an	1
anomalous	1
creature.	1
He	1
has	1
no	1
proper	1
nose.	1
And	1
since	1
the	1
nose	1
is	1
the	1
central	1
and	1
most	1
conspicuous	1
of	1
the	1
features;	1
and	1
since	1
it	1
perhaps	1
most	1
modifies	1
and	1
finally	1
controls	1
their	1
combined	1
expression;	1
hence	1
it	1
would	1
seem	1
that	1
its	1
entire	1
absence,	1
as	1
an	1
external	1
appendage,	1
must	1
very	1
largely	1
affect	1
the	1
countenance	1
of	1
the	1
whale.	1
For	1
as	1
in	1
landscape	1
gardening,	1
a	1
spire,	1
cupola,	1
monument,	1
or	1
tower	1
of	1
some	1
sort,	1
is	1
deemed	1
almost	1
indispensable	1
to	1
the	1
completion	1
of	1
the	1
scene;	1
so	1
no	1
face	1
can	1
be	1
physiognomically	1
in	1
keeping	1
without	1
the	1
elevated	1
open-work	1
belfry	1
of	1
the	1
nose.	1
Dash	1
the	1
nose	1
from	1
Phidias's	1
marble	1
Jove,	1
and	1
what	1
a	1
sorry	1
remainder!	1
Nevertheless,	1
Leviathan	1
is	1
of	1
so	1
mighty	1
a	1
magnitude,	1
all	1
his	1
proportions	1
are	1
so	1
stately,	1
that	1
the	1
same	1
deficiency	1
which	1
in	1
the	1
sculptured	1
Jove	1
were	1
hideous,	1
in	1
him	1
is	1
no	1
blemish	1
at	1
all.	1
Nay,	1
it	1
is	1
an	1
added	1
grandeur.	1
A	1
nose	1
to	1
the	1
whale	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
impertinent.	1
As	1
on	1
your	1
physiognomical	1
voyage	1
you	1
sail	1
round	1
his	1
vast	1
head	1
in	1
your	1
jolly-boat,	1
your	1
noble	1
conceptions	1
of	1
him	1
are	1
never	1
insulted	1
by	1
the	1
reflection	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
a	1
nose	1
to	1
be	1
pulled.	1
A	1
pestilent	1
conceit,	1
which	1
so	1
often	1
will	1
insist	1
upon	1
obtruding	1
even	1
when	1
beholding	1
the	1
mightiest	1
royal	1
beadle	1
on	1
his	1
throne.	1
In	1
some	1
particulars,	1
perhaps	1
the	1
most	1
imposing	1
physiognomical	1
view	1
to	1
be	1
had	1
of	1
the	1
Sperm	1
Whale,	1
is	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
full	1
front	1
of	1
his	1
head.	1
This	1
aspect	1
is	1
sublime.	1
In	1
thought,	1
a	1
fine	1
human	1
brow	1
is	1
like	1
the	1
East	1
when	1
troubled	1
with	1
the	1
morning.	1
In	1
the	1
repose	1
of	1
the	1
pasture,	1
the	1
curled	1
brow	1
of	1
the	1
bull	1
has	1
a	1
touch	1
of	1
the	1
grand	1
in	1
it.	1
Pushing	1
heavy	1
cannon	1
up	1
mountain	1
defiles,	1
the	1
elephant's	1
brow	1
is	1
majestic.	1
Human	1
or	1
animal,	1
the	1
mystical	1
brow	1
is	1
as	1
that	1
great	1
golden	1
seal	1
affixed	1
by	1
the	1
German	1
Emperors	1
to	1
their	1
decrees.	1
It	1
signifies--"God:	1
done	1
this	1
day	1
by	1
my	1
hand."	1
But	1
in	1
most	1
creatures,	1
nay	1
in	1
man	1
himself,	1
very	1
often	1
the	1
brow	1
is	1
but	1
a	1
mere	1
strip	1
of	1
alpine	1
land	1
lying	1
along	1
the	1
snow	1
line.	1
Few	1
are	1
the	1
foreheads	1
which	1
like	1
Shakespeare's	1
or	1
Melancthon's	1
rise	1
so	1
high,	1
and	1
descend	1
so	1
low,	1
that	1
the	1
eyes	1
themselves	1
seem	1
clear,	1
eternal,	1
tideless	1
mountain	1
lakes;	1
and	1
all	1
above	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
forehead's	1
wrinkles,	1
you	1
seem	1
to	1
track	1
the	1
antlered	1
thoughts	1
descending	1
there	1
to	1
drink,	1
as	1
the	1
Highland	1
hunters	1
track	1
the	1
snow	1
prints	1
of	1
the	1
deer.	1
But	1
in	1
the	1
great	1
Sperm	1
Whale,	1
this	1
high	1
and	1
mighty	1
god-like	1
dignity	1
inherent	1
in	1
the	1
brow	1
is	1
so	1
immensely	1
amplified,	1
that	1
gazing	1
on	1
it,	1
in	1
that	1
full	1
front	1
view,	1
you	1
feel	1
the	1
Deity	1
and	1
the	1
dread	1
powers	1
more	1
forcibly	1
than	1
in	1
beholding	1
any	1
other	1
object	1
in	1
living	1
nature.	1
For	1
you	1
see	1
no	1
one	1
point	1
precisely;	1
not	1
one	1
distinct	1
feature	1
is	1
revealed;	1
no	1
nose,	1
eyes,	1
ears,	1
or	1
mouth;	1
no	1
face;	1
he	1
has	1
none,	1
proper;	1
nothing	1
but	1
that	1
one	1
broad	1
firmament	1
of	1
a	1
forehead,	1
pleated	1
with	1
riddles;	1
dumbly	1
lowering	1
with	1
the	1
doom	1
of	1
boats,	1
and	1
ships,	1
and	1
men.	1
Nor,	1
in	1
profile,	1
does	1
this	1
wondrous	1
brow	1
diminish;	1
though	1
that	1
way	1
viewed	1
its	1
grandeur	1
does	1
not	1
domineer	1
upon	1
you	1
so.	1
In	1
profile,	1
you	1
plainly	1
perceive	1
that	1
horizontal,	1
semi-crescentic	1
depression	1
in	1
the	1
forehead's	1
middle,	1
which,	1
in	1
man,	1
is	1
Lavater's	1
mark	1
of	1
genius.	1
But	1
how?	1
Genius	1
in	1
the	1
Sperm	1
Whale?	1
Has	1
the	1
Sperm	1
Whale	1
ever	1
written	1
a	1
book,	1
spoken	1
a	1
speech?	1
No,	1
his	1
great	1
genius	1
is	1
declared	1
in	1
his	1
doing	1
nothing	1
particular	1
to	1
prove	1
it.	1
It	1
is	1
moreover	1
declared	1
in	1
his	1
pyramidical	1
silence.	1
And	1
this	1
reminds	1
me	1
that	1
had	1
the	1
great	1
Sperm	1
Whale	1
been	1
known	1
to	1
the	1
young	1
Orient	1
World,	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
deified	1
by	1
their	1
child-magian	1
thoughts.	1
They	1
deified	1
the	1
crocodile	1
of	1
the	1
Nile,	1
because	1
the	1
crocodile	1
is	1
tongueless;	1
and	1
the	1
Sperm	1
Whale	1
has	1
no	1
tongue,	1
or	1
at	1
least	1
it	1
is	1
so	1
exceedingly	1
small,	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
incapable	1
of	1
protrusion.	1
If	1
hereafter	1
any	1
highly	1
cultured,	1
poetical	1
nation	1
shall	1
lure	1
back	1
to	1
their	1
birth-right,	1
the	1
merry	1
May-day	1
gods	1
of	1
old;	1
and	1
livingly	1
enthrone	1
them	1
again	1
in	1
the	1
now	1
egotistical	1
sky;	1
in	1
the	1
now	1
unhaunted	1
hill;	1
then	1
be	1
sure,	1
exalted	1
to	1
Jove's	1
high	1
seat,	1
the	1
great	1
Sperm	1
Whale	1
shall	1
lord	1
it.	1

CHAPTER	1
80	1
The	1
Nut.	1
If	1
the	1
Sperm	1
Whale	1
be	1
physiognomically	1
a	1
Sphinx,	1
to	1
the	1
phrenologist	1
his	1
brain	1
seems	1
that	1
geometrical	1
circle	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
to	1
square.	1
In	1
the	1
full-grown	1
creature	1
the	1
skull	1
will	1
measure	1
at	1
least	1
twenty	1
feet	1
in	1
length.	1
Unhinge	1
the	1
lower	1
jaw,	1
and	1
the	1
side	1
view	1
of	1
this	1
skull	1
is	1
as	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
a	1
moderately	1
inclined	1
plane	1
resting	1
throughout	1
on	1
a	1
level	1
base.	1
But	1
in	1
life--as	1
we	1
have	1
elsewhere	1
seen--this	1
inclined	1
plane	1
is	1
angularly	1
filled	1
up,	1
and	1
almost	1
squared	1
by	1
the	1
enormous	1
superincumbent	1
mass	1
of	1
the	1
junk	1
and	1
sperm.	1
At	1
the	1
high	1
end	1
the	1
skull	1
forms	1
a	1
crater	1
to	1
bed	1
that	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
mass;	1
while	1
under	1
the	1
long	1
floor	1
of	1
this	1
crater--in	1
another	1
cavity	1
seldom	1
exceeding	1
ten	1
inches	1
in	1
length	1
and	1
as	1
many	1
in	1
depth--reposes	1
the	1
mere	1
handful	1
of	1
this	1
monster's	1
brain.	1
The	1
brain	1
is	1
at	1
least	1
twenty	1
feet	1
from	1
his	1
apparent	1
forehead	1
in	1
life;	1
it	1
is	1
hidden	1
away	1
behind	1
its	1
vast	1
outworks,	1
like	1
the	1
innermost	1
citadel	1
within	1
the	1
amplified	1
fortifications	1
of	1
Quebec.	1
So	1
like	1
a	1
choice	1
casket	1
is	1
it	1
secreted	1
in	1
him,	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
known	1
some	1
whalemen	1
who	1
peremptorily	1
deny	1
that	1
the	1
Sperm	1
Whale	1
has	1
any	1
other	1
brain	1
than	1
that	1
palpable	1
semblance	1
of	1
one	1
formed	1
by	1
the	1
cubic-yards	1
of	1
his	1
sperm	1
magazine.	1
Lying	1
in	1
strange	1
folds,	1
courses,	1
and	1
convolutions,	1
to	1
their	1
apprehensions,	1
it	1
seems	1
more	1
in	1
keeping	1
with	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
his	1
general	1
might	1
to	1
regard	1
that	1
mystic	1
part	1
of	1
him	1
as	1
the	1
seat	1
of	1
his	1
intelligence.	1
It	1
is	1
plain,	1
then,	1
that	1
phrenologically	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
this	1
Leviathan,	1
in	1
the	1
creature's	1
living	1
intact	1
state,	1
is	1
an	1
entire	1
delusion.	1
As	1
for	1
his	1
true	1
brain,	1
you	1
can	1
then	1
see	1
no	1
indications	1
of	1
it,	1
nor	1
feel	1
any.	1
The	1
whale,	1
like	1
all	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
mighty,	1
wears	1
a	1
false	1
brow	1
to	1
the	1
common	1
world.	1
If	1
you	1
unload	1
his	1
skull	1
of	1
its	1
spermy	1
heaps	1
and	1
then	1
take	1
a	1
rear	1
view	1
of	1
its	1
rear	1
end,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
high	1
end,	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
struck	1
by	1
its	1
resemblance	1
to	1
the	1
human	1
skull,	1
beheld	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
situation,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
same	1
point	1
of	1
view.	1
Indeed,	1
place	1
this	1
reversed	1
skull	1
(scaled	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
human	1
magnitude)	1
among	1
a	1
plate	1
of	1
men's	1
skulls,	1
and	1
you	1
would	1
involuntarily	1
confound	1
it	1
with	1
them;	1
and	1
remarking	1
the	1
depressions	1
on	1
one	1
part	1
of	1
its	1
summit,	1
in	1
phrenological	1
phrase	1
you	1
would	1
say--This	1
man	1
had	1
no	1
self-esteem,	1
and	1
no	1
veneration.	1
And	1
by	1
those	1
negations,	1
considered	1
along	1
with	1
the	1
affirmative	1
fact	1
of	1
his	1
prodigious	1
bulk	1
and	1
power,	1
you	1
can	1
best	1
form	1
to	1
yourself	1
the	1
truest,	1
though	1
not	1
the	1
most	1
exhilarating	1
conception	1
of	1
what	1
the	1
most	1
exalted	1
potency	1
is.	1
But	1
if	1
from	1
the	1
comparative	1
dimensions	1
of	1
the	1
whale's	1
proper	1
brain,	1
you	1
deem	1
it	1
incapable	1
of	1
being	1
adequately	1
charted,	1
then	1
I	1
have	1
another	1
idea	1
for	1
you.	1
If	1
you	1
attentively	1
regard	1
almost	1
any	1
quadruped's	1
spine,	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
struck	1
with	1
the	1
resemblance	1
of	1
its	1
vertebrae	1
to	1
a	1
strung	1
necklace	1
of	1
dwarfed	1
skulls,	1
all	1
bearing	1
rudimental	1
resemblance	1
to	1
the	1
skull	1
proper.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
German	1
conceit,	1
that	1
the	1
vertebrae	1
are	1
absolutely	1
undeveloped	1
skulls.	1
But	1
the	1
curious	1
external	1
resemblance,	1
I	1
take	1
it	1
the	1
Germans	1
were	1
not	1
the	1
first	1
men	1
to	1
perceive.	1
A	1
foreign	1
friend	1
once	1
pointed	1
it	1
out	1
to	1
me,	1
in	1
the	1
skeleton	1
of	1
a	1
foe	1
he	1
had	1
slain,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
vertebrae	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
inlaying,	1
in	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
basso-relievo,	1
the	1
beaked	1
prow	1
of	1
his	1
canoe.	1
Now,	1
I	1
consider	1
that	1
the	1
phrenologists	1
have	1
omitted	1
an	1
important	1
thing	1
in	1
not	1
pushing	1
their	1
investigations	1
from	1
the	1
cerebellum	1
through	1
the	1
spinal	1
canal.	1
For	1
I	1
believe	1
that	1
much	1
of	1
a	1
man's	1
character	1
will	1
be	1
found	1
betokened	1
in	1
his	1
backbone.	1
I	1
would	1
rather	1
feel	1
your	1
spine	1
than	1
your	1
skull,	1
whoever	1
you	1
are.	1
A	1
thin	1
joist	1
of	1
a	1
spine	1
never	1
yet	1
upheld	1
a	1
full	1
and	1
noble	1
soul.	1
I	1
rejoice	1
in	1
my	1
spine,	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
firm	1
audacious	1
staff	1
of	1
that	1
flag	1
which	1
I	1
fling	1
half	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
world.	1
Apply	1
this	1
spinal	1
branch	1
of	1
phrenology	1
to	1
the	1
Sperm	1
Whale.	1
His	1
cranial	1
cavity	1
is	1
continuous	1
with	1
the	1
first	1
neck-vertebra;	1
and	1
in	1
that	1
vertebra	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
spinal	1
canal	1
will	1
measure	1
ten	1
inches	1
across,	1
being	1
eight	1
in	1
height,	1
and	1
of	1
a	1
triangular	1
figure	1
with	1
the	1
base	1
downwards.	1
As	1
it	1
passes	1
through	1
the	1
remaining	1
vertebrae	1
the	1
canal	1
tapers	1
in	1
size,	1
but	1
for	1
a	1
considerable	1
distance	1
remains	1
of	1
large	1
capacity.	1
Now,	1
of	1
course,	1
this	1
canal	1
is	1
filled	1
with	1
much	1
the	1
same	1
strangely	1
fibrous	1
substance--the	1
spinal	1
cord--as	1
the	1
brain;	1
and	1
directly	1
communicates	1
with	1
the	1
brain.	1
And	1
what	1
is	1
still	1
more,	1
for	1
many	1
feet	1
after	1
emerging	1
from	1
the	1
brain's	1
cavity,	1
the	1
spinal	1
cord	1
remains	1
of	1
an	1
undecreasing	1
girth,	1
almost	1
equal	1
to	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
brain.	1
Under	1
all	1
these	1
circumstances,	1
would	1
it	1
be	1
unreasonable	1
to	1
survey	1
and	1
map	1
out	1
the	1
whale's	1
spine	1
phrenologically?	1
For,	1
viewed	1
in	1
this	1
light,	1
the	1
wonderful	1
comparative	1
smallness	1
of	1
his	1
brain	1
proper	1
is	1
more	1
than	1
compensated	1
by	1
the	1
wonderful	1
comparative	1
magnitude	1
of	1
his	1
spinal	1
cord.	1
But	1
leaving	1
this	1
hint	1
to	1
operate	1
as	1
it	1
may	1
with	1
the	1
phrenologists,	1
I	1
would	1
merely	1
assume	1
the	1
spinal	1
theory	1
for	1
a	1
moment,	1
in	1
reference	1
to	1
the	1
Sperm	1
Whale's	1
hump.	1
This	1
august	1
hump,	1
if	1
I	1
mistake	1
not,	1
rises	1
over	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
larger	1
vertebrae,	1
and	1
is,	1
therefore,	1
in	1
some	1
sort,	1
the	1
outer	1
convex	1
mould	1
of	1
it.	1
From	1
its	1
relative	1
situation	1
then,	1
I	1
should	1
call	1
this	1
high	1
hump	1
the	1
organ	1
of	1
firmness	1
or	1
indomitableness	1
in	1
the	1
Sperm	1
Whale.	1
And	1
that	1
the	1
great	1
monster	1
is	1
indomitable,	1
you	1
will	1
yet	1
have	1
reason	1
to	1
know.	1
CHAPTER	1
81	1
The	1
Pequod	1
Meets	1
The	1
Virgin.	1
The	1
predestinated	1
day	1
arrived,	1
and	1
we	1
duly	1
met	1
the	1
ship	1
Jungfrau,	1
Derick	1
De	1
Deer,	1
master,	1
of	1
Bremen.	1
At	1
one	1
time	1
the	1
greatest	1
whaling	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
the	1
Dutch	1
and	1
Germans	1
are	1
now	1
among	1
the	1
least;	1
but	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
at	1
very	1
wide	1
intervals	1
of	1
latitude	1
and	1
longitude,	1
you	1
still	1
occasionally	1
meet	1
with	1
their	1
flag	1
in	1
the	1
Pacific.	1
For	1
some	1
reason,	1
the	1
Jungfrau	1
seemed	1
quite	1
eager	1
to	1
pay	1
her	1
respects.	1
While	1
yet	1
some	1
distance	1
from	1
the	1
Pequod,	1
she	1
rounded	1
to,	1
and	1
dropping	1
a	1
boat,	1
her	1
captain	1
was	1
impelled	1
towards	1
us,	1
impatiently	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
bows	1
instead	1
of	1
the	1
stern.	1
"What	1
has	1
he	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
there?"	1
cried	1
Starbuck,	1
pointing	1
to	1
something	1
wavingly	1
held	1
by	1
the	1
German.	1
"Impossible!--a	1
lamp-feeder!"	1
"Not	1
that,"	1
said	1
Stubb,	1
"no,	1
no,	1
it's	1
a	1
coffee-pot,	1
Mr.	1
Starbuck;	1
he's	1
coming	1
off	1
to	1
make	1
us	1
our	1
coffee,	1
is	1
the	1
Yarman;	1
don't	1
you	1
see	1
that	1
big	1
tin	1
can	1
there	1
alongside	1
of	1
him?--that's	1
his	1
boiling	1
water.	1
Oh!	1
he's	1
all	1
right,	1
is	1
the	1
Yarman."	1
"Go	1
along	1
with	1
you,"	1
cried	1
Flask,	1
"it's	1
a	1
lamp-feeder	1
and	1
an	1
oil-can.	1
He's	1
out	1
of	1
oil,	1
and	1
has	1
come	1
a-begging."	1
However	1
curious	1
it	1
may	1
seem	1
for	1
an	1
oil-ship	1
to	1
be	1
borrowing	1
oil	1
on	1
the	1
whale-ground,	1
and	1
however	1
much	1
it	1
may	1
invertedly	1
contradict	1
the	1
old	1
proverb	1
about	1
carrying	1
coals	1
to	1
Newcastle,	1
yet	1
sometimes	1
such	1
a	1
thing	1
really	1
happens;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
present	1
case	1
Captain	1
Derick	1
De	1
Deer	1
did	1
indubitably	1
conduct	1
a	1
lamp-feeder	1
as	1
Flask	1
did	1
declare.	1
As	1
he	1
mounted	1
the	1
deck,	1
Ahab	1
abruptly	1
accosted	1
him,	1
without	1
at	1
all	1
heeding	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
in	1
his	1
hand;	1
but	1
in	1
his	1
broken	1
lingo,	1
the	1
German	1
soon	1
evinced	1
his	1
complete	1
ignorance	1
of	1
the	1
White	1
Whale;	1
immediately	1
turning	1
the	1
conversation	1
to	1
his	1
lamp-feeder	1
and	1
oil	1
can,	1
with	1
some	1
remarks	1
touching	1
his	1
having	1
to	1
turn	1
into	1
his	1
hammock	1
at	1
night	1
in	1
profound	1
darkness--his	1
last	1
drop	1
of	1
Bremen	1
oil	1
being	1
gone,	1
and	1
not	1
a	1
single	1
flying-fish	1
yet	1
captured	1
to	1
supply	1
the	1
deficiency;	1
concluding	1
by	1
hinting	1
that	1
his	1
ship	1
was	1
indeed	1
what	1
in	1
the	1
Fishery	1
is	1
technically	1
called	1
a	1
CLEAN	1
one	1
(that	1
is,	1
an	1
empty	1
one),	1
well	1
deserving	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Jungfrau	1
or	1
the	1
Virgin.	1
His	1
necessities	1
supplied,	1
Derick	1
departed;	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
gained	1
his	1
ship's	1
side,	1
when	1
whales	1
were	1
almost	1
simultaneously	1
raised	1
from	1
the	1
mast-heads	1
of	1
both	1
vessels;	1
and	1
so	1
eager	1
for	1
the	1
chase	1
was	1
Derick,	1
that	1
without	1
pausing	1
to	1
put	1
his	1
oil-can	1
and	1
lamp-feeder	1
aboard,	1
he	1
slewed	1
round	1
his	1
boat	1
and	1
made	1
after	1
the	1
leviathan	1
lamp-feeders.	1
Now,	1
the	1
game	1
having	1
risen	1
to	1
leeward,	1
he	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
three	1
German	1
boats	1
that	1
soon	1
followed	1
him,	1
had	1
considerably	1
the	1
start	1
of	1
the	1
Pequod's	1
keels.	1
There	1
were	1
eight	1
whales,	1
an	1
average	1
pod.	1
Aware	1
of	1
their	1
danger,	1
they	1
were	1
going	1
all	1
abreast	1
with	1
great	1
speed	1
straight	1
before	1
the	1
wind,	1
rubbing	1
their	1
flanks	1
as	1
closely	1
as	1
so	1
many	1
spans	1
of	1
horses	1
in	1
harness.	1
They	1
left	1
a	1
great,	1
wide	1
wake,	1
as	1
though	1
continually	1
unrolling	1
a	1
great	1
wide	1
parchment	1
upon	1
the	1
sea.	1
Full	1
in	1
this	1
rapid	1
wake,	1
and	1
many	1
fathoms	1
in	1
the	1
rear,	1
swam	1
a	1
huge,	1
humped	1
old	1
bull,	1
which	1
by	1
his	1
comparatively	1
slow	1
progress,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
by	1
the	1
unusual	1
yellowish	1
incrustations	1
overgrowing	1
him,	1
seemed	1
afflicted	1
with	1
the	1
jaundice,	1
or	1
some	1
other	1
infirmity.	1
Whether	1
this	1
whale	1
belonged	1
to	1
the	1
pod	1
in	1
advance,	1
seemed	1
questionable;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
customary	1
for	1
such	1
venerable	1
leviathans	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
all	1
social.	1
Nevertheless,	1
he	1
stuck	1
to	1
their	1
wake,	1
though	1
indeed	1
their	1
back	1
water	1
must	1
have	1
retarded	1
him,	1
because	1
the	1
white-bone	1
or	1
swell	1
at	1
his	1
broad	1
muzzle	1
was	1
a	1
dashed	1
one,	1
like	1
the	1
swell	1
formed	1
when	1
two	1
hostile	1
currents	1
meet.	1
His	1
spout	1
was	1
short,	1
slow,	1
and	1
laborious;	1
coming	1
forth	1
with	1
a	1
choking	1
sort	1
of	1
gush,	1
and	1
spending	1
itself	1
in	1
torn	1
shreds,	1
followed	1
by	1
strange	1
subterranean	1
commotions	1
in	1
him,	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
egress	1
at	1
his	1
other	1
buried	1
extremity,	1
causing	1
the	1
waters	1
behind	1
him	1
to	1
upbubble.	1
"Who's	1
got	1
some	1
paregoric?"	1
said	1
Stubb,	1
"he	1
has	1
the	1
stomach-ache,	1
I'm	1
afraid.	1
Lord,	1
think	1
of	1
having	1
half	1
an	1
acre	1
of	1
stomach-ache!	1
Adverse	1
winds	1
are	1
holding	1
mad	1
Christmas	1
in	1
him,	1
boys.	1
It's	1
the	1
first	1
foul	1
wind	1
I	1
ever	1
knew	1
to	1
blow	1
from	1
astern;	1
but	1
look,	1
did	1
ever	1
whale	1
yaw	1
so	1
before?	1
it	1
must	1
be,	1
he's	1
lost	1
his	1
tiller."	1
As	1
an	1
overladen	1
Indiaman	1
bearing	1
down	1
the	1
Hindostan	1
coast	1
with	1
a	1
deck	1
load	1
of	1
frightened	1
horses,	1
careens,	1
buries,	1
rolls,	1
and	1
wallows	1
on	1
her	1
way;	1
so	1
did	1
this	1
old	1
whale	1
heave	1
his	1
aged	1
bulk,	1
and	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
partly	1
turning	1
over	1
on	1
his	1
cumbrous	1
rib-ends,	1
expose	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
his	1
devious	1
wake	1
in	1
the	1
unnatural	1
stump	1
of	1
his	1
starboard	1
fin.	1
Whether	1
he	1
had	1
lost	1
that	1
fin	1
in	1
battle,	1
or	1
had	1
been	1
born	1
without	1
it,	1
it	1
were	1
hard	1
to	1
say.	1
"Only	1
wait	1
a	1
bit,	1
old	1
chap,	1
and	1
I'll	1
give	1
ye	1
a	1
sling	1
for	1
that	1
wounded	1
arm,"	1
cried	1
cruel	1
Flask,	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
whale-line	1
near	1
him.	1
"Mind	1
he	1
don't	1
sling	1
thee	1
with	1
it,"	1
cried	1
Starbuck.	1
"Give	1
way,	1
or	1
the	1
German	1
will	1
have	1
him."	1
With	1
one	1
intent	1
all	1
the	1
combined	1
rival	1
boats	1
were	1
pointed	1
for	1
this	1
one	1
fish,	1
because	1
not	1
only	1
was	1
he	1
the	1
largest,	1
and	1
therefore	1
the	1
most	1
valuable	1
whale,	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
nearest	1
to	1
them,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
whales	1
were	1
going	1
with	1
such	1
great	1
velocity,	1
moreover,	1
as	1
almost	1
to	1
defy	1
pursuit	1
for	1
the	1
time.	1
At	1
this	1
juncture	1
the	1
Pequod's	1
keels	1
had	1
shot	1
by	1
the	1
three	1
German	1
boats	1
last	1
lowered;	1
but	1
from	1
the	1
great	1
start	1
he	1
had	1
had,	1
Derick's	1
boat	1
still	1
led	1
the	1
chase,	1
though	1
every	1
moment	1
neared	1
by	1
his	1
foreign	1
rivals.	1
The	1
only	1
thing	1
they	1
feared,	1
was,	1
that	1
from	1
being	1
already	1
so	1
nigh	1
to	1
his	1
mark,	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
enabled	1
to	1
dart	1
his	1
iron	1
before	1
they	1
could	1
completely	1
overtake	1
and	1
pass	1
him.	1
As	1
for	1
Derick,	1
he	1
seemed	1
quite	1
confident	1
that	1
this	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
case,	1
and	1
occasionally	1
with	1
a	1
deriding	1
gesture	1
shook	1
his	1
lamp-feeder	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
boats.	1
"The	1
ungracious	1
and	1
ungrateful	1
dog!"	1
cried	1
Starbuck;	1
"he	1
mocks	1
and	1
dares	1
me	1
with	1
the	1
very	1
poor-box	1
I	1
filled	1
for	1
him	1
not	1
five	1
minutes	1
ago!"--then	1
in	1
his	1
old	1
intense	1
whisper--"Give	1
way,	1
greyhounds!	1
Dog	1
to	1
it!"	1
"I	1
tell	1
ye	1
what	1
it	1
is,	1
men"--cried	1
Stubb	1
to	1
his	1
crew--"it's	1
against	1
my	1
religion	1
to	1
get	1
mad;	1
but	1
I'd	1
like	1
to	1
eat	1
that	1
villainous	1
Yarman--Pull--won't	1
ye?	1
Are	1
ye	1
going	1
to	1
let	1
that	1
rascal	1
beat	1
ye?	1
Do	1
ye	1
love	1
brandy?	1
A	1
hogshead	1
of	1
brandy,	1
then,	1
to	1
the	1
best	1
man.	1
Come,	1
why	1
don't	1
some	1
of	1
ye	1
burst	1
a	1
blood-vessel?	1
Who's	1
that	1
been	1
dropping	1
an	1
anchor	1
overboard--we	1
don't	1
budge	1
an	1
inch--we're	1
becalmed.	1
Halloo,	1
here's	1
grass	1
growing	1
in	1
the	1
boat's	1
bottom--and	1
by	1
the	1
Lord,	1
the	1
mast	1
there's	1
budding.	1
This	1
won't	1
do,	1
boys.	1
Look	1
at	1
that	1
Yarman!	1
The	1
short	1
and	1
long	1
of	1
it	1
is,	1
men,	1
will	1
ye	1
spit	1
fire	1
or	1
not?"	1
"Oh!	1
see	1
the	1
suds	1
he	1
makes!"	1
cried	1
Flask,	1
dancing	1
up	1
and	1
down--"What	1
a	1
hump--Oh,	1
DO	1
pile	1
on	1
the	1
beef--lays	1
like	1
a	1
log!	1
Oh!	1
my	1
lads,	1
DO	1
spring--slap-jacks	1
and	1
quahogs	1
for	1
supper,	1
you	1
know,	1
my	1
lads--baked	1
clams	1
and	1
muffins--oh,	1
DO,	1
DO,	1
spring,--he's	1
a	1
hundred	1
barreller--don't	1
lose	1
him	1
now--don't	1
oh,	1
DON'T!--see	1
that	1
Yarman--Oh,	1
won't	1
ye	1
pull	1
for	1
your	1
duff,	1
my	1
lads--such	1
a	1
sog!	1
such	1
a	1
sogger!	1
Don't	1
ye	1
love	1
sperm?	1
There	1
goes	1
three	1
thousand	1
dollars,	1
men!--a	1
bank!--a	1
whole	1
bank!	1
The	1
bank	1
of	1
England!--Oh,	1
DO,	1
DO,	1
DO!--What's	1
that	1
Yarman	1
about	1
now?"	1
At	1
this	1
moment	1
Derick	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
act	1
of	1
pitching	1
his	1
lamp-feeder	1
at	1
the	1
advancing	1
boats,	1
and	1
also	1
his	1
oil-can;	1
perhaps	1
with	1
the	1
double	1
view	1
of	1
retarding	1
his	1
rivals'	1
way,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
economically	1
accelerating	1
his	1
own	1
by	1
the	1
momentary	1
impetus	1
of	1
the	1
backward	1
toss.	1
"The	1
unmannerly	1
Dutch	1
dogger!"	1
cried	1
Stubb.	1
"Pull	1
now,	1
men,	1
like	1
fifty	1
thousand	1
line-of-battle-ship	1
loads	1
of	1
red-haired	1
devils.	1
What	1
d'ye	1
say,	1
Tashtego;	1
are	1
you	1
the	1
man	1
to	1
snap	1
your	1
spine	1
in	1
two-and-twenty	1
pieces	1
for	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
old	1
Gayhead?	1
What	1
d'ye	1
say?"	1
"I	1
say,	1
pull	1
like	1
god-dam,"--cried	1
the	1
Indian.	1
Fiercely,	1
but	1
evenly	1
incited	1
by	1
the	1
taunts	1
of	1
the	1
German,	1
the	1
Pequod's	1
three	1
boats	1
now	1
began	1
ranging	1
almost	1
abreast;	1
and,	1
so	1
disposed,	1
momentarily	1
neared	1
him.	1
In	1
that	1
fine,	1
loose,	1
chivalrous	1
attitude	1
of	1
the	1
headsman	1
when	1
drawing	1
near	1
to	1
his	1
prey,	1
the	1
three	1
mates	1
stood	1
up	1
proudly,	1
occasionally	1
backing	1
the	1
after	1
oarsman	1
with	1
an	1
exhilarating	1
cry	1
of,	1
"There	1
she	1
slides,	1
now!	1
Hurrah	1
for	1
the	1
white-ash	1
breeze!	1
Down	1
with	1
the	1
Yarman!	1
Sail	1
over	1
him!"	1
But	1
so	1
decided	1
an	1
original	1
start	1
had	1
Derick	1
had,	1
that	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
their	1
gallantry,	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
proved	1
the	1
victor	1
in	1
this	1
race,	1
had	1
not	1
a	1
righteous	1
judgment	1
descended	1
upon	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
crab	1
which	1
caught	1
the	1
blade	1
of	1
his	1
midship	1
oarsman.	1
While	1
this	1
clumsy	1
lubber	1
was	1
striving	1
to	1
free	1
his	1
white-ash,	1
and	1
while,	1
in	1
consequence,	1
Derick's	1
boat	1
was	1
nigh	1
to	1
capsizing,	1
and	1
he	1
thundering	1
away	1
at	1
his	1
men	1
in	1
a	1
mighty	1
rage;--that	1
was	1
a	1
good	1
time	1
for	1
Starbuck,	1
Stubb,	1
and	1
Flask.	1
With	1
a	1
shout,	1
they	1
took	1
a	1
mortal	1
start	1
forwards,	1
and	1
slantingly	1
ranged	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
German's	1
quarter.	1
An	1
instant	1
more,	1
and	1
all	1
four	1
boats	1
were	1
diagonically	1
in	1
the	1
whale's	1
immediate	1
wake,	1
while	1
stretching	1
from	1
them,	1
on	1
both	1
sides,	1
was	1
the	1
foaming	1
swell	1
that	1
he	1
made.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
terrific,	1
most	1
pitiable,	1
and	1
maddening	1
sight.	1
The	1
whale	1
was	1
now	1
going	1
head	1
out,	1
and	1
sending	1
his	1
spout	1
before	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
continual	1
tormented	1
jet;	1
while	1
his	1
one	1
poor	1
fin	1
beat	1
his	1
side	1
in	1
an	1
agony	1
of	1
fright.	1
Now	1
to	1
this	1
hand,	1
now	1
to	1
that,	1
he	1
yawed	1
in	1
his	1
faltering	1
flight,	1
and	1
still	1
at	1
every	1
billow	1
that	1
he	1
broke,	1
he	1
spasmodically	1
sank	1
in	1
the	1
sea,	1
or	1
sideways	1
rolled	1
towards	1
the	1
sky	1
his	1
one	1
beating	1
fin.	1
So	1
have	1
I	1
seen	1
a	1
bird	1
with	1
clipped	1
wing	1
making	1
affrighted	1
broken	1
circles	1
in	1
the	1
air,	1
vainly	1
striving	1
to	1
escape	1
the	1
piratical	1
hawks.	1
But	1
the	1
bird	1
has	1
a	1
voice,	1
and	1
with	1
plaintive	1
cries	1
will	1
make	1
known	1
her	1
fear;	1
but	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
this	1
vast	1
dumb	1
brute	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
was	1
chained	1
up	1
and	1
enchanted	1
in	1
him;	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
voice,	1
save	1
that	1
choking	1
respiration	1
through	1
his	1
spiracle,	1
and	1
this	1
made	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
him	1
unspeakably	1
pitiable;	1
while	1
still,	1
in	1
his	1
amazing	1
bulk,	1
portcullis	1
jaw,	1
and	1
omnipotent	1
tail,	1
there	1
was	1
enough	1
to	1
appal	1
the	1
stoutest	1
man	1
who	1
so	1
pitied.	1
Seeing	1
now	1
that	1
but	1
a	1
very	1
few	1
moments	1
more	1
would	1
give	1
the	1
Pequod's	1
boats	1
the	1
advantage,	1
and	1
rather	1
than	1
be	1
thus	1
foiled	1
of	1
his	1
game,	1
Derick	1
chose	1
to	1
hazard	1
what	1
to	1
him	1
must	1
have	1
seemed	1
a	1
most	1
unusually	1
long	1
dart,	1
ere	1
the	1
last	1
chance	1
would	1
for	1
ever	1
escape.	1
But	1
no	1
sooner	1
did	1
his	1
harpooneer	1
stand	1
up	1
for	1
the	1
stroke,	1
than	1
all	1
three	1
tigers--Queequeg,	1
Tashtego,	1
Daggoo--instinctively	1
sprang	1
to	1
their	1
feet,	1
and	1
standing	1
in	1
a	1
diagonal	1
row,	1
simultaneously	1
pointed	1
their	1
barbs;	1
and	1
darted	1
over	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
German	1
harpooneer,	1
their	1
three	1
Nantucket	1
irons	1
entered	1
the	1
whale.	1
Blinding	1
vapours	1
of	1
foam	1
and	1
white-fire!	1
The	1
three	1
boats,	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
fury	1
of	1
the	1
whale's	1
headlong	1
rush,	1
bumped	1
the	1
German's	1
aside	1
with	1
such	1
force,	1
that	1
both	1
Derick	1
and	1
his	1
baffled	1
harpooneer	1
were	1
spilled	1
out,	1
and	1
sailed	1
over	1
by	1
the	1
three	1
flying	1
keels.	1
"Don't	1
be	1
afraid,	1
my	1
butter-boxes,"	1
cried	1
Stubb,	1
casting	1
a	1
passing	1
glance	1
upon	1
them	1
as	1
he	1
shot	1
by;	1
"ye'll	1
be	1
picked	1
up	1
presently--all	1
right--I	1
saw	1
some	1
sharks	1
astern--St.	1
Bernard's	1
dogs,	1
you	1
know--relieve	1
distressed	1
travellers.	1
Hurrah!	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
sail	1
now.	1
Every	1
keel	1
a	1
sunbeam!	1
Hurrah!--Here	1
we	1
go	1
like	1
three	1
tin	1
kettles	1
at	1
the	1
tail	1
of	1
a	1
mad	1
cougar!	1
This	1
puts	1
me	1
in	1
mind	1
of	1
fastening	1
to	1
an	1
elephant	1
in	1
a	1
tilbury	1
on	1
a	1
plain--makes	1
the	1
wheel-spokes	1
fly,	1
boys,	1
when	1
you	1
fasten	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
way;	1
and	1
there's	1
danger	1
of	1
being	1
pitched	1
out	1
too,	1
when	1
you	1
strike	1
a	1
hill.	1
Hurrah!	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
way	1
a	1
fellow	1
feels	1
when	1
he's	1
going	1
to	1
Davy	1
Jones--all	1
a	1
rush	1
down	1
an	1
endless	1
inclined	1
plane!	1
Hurrah!	1
this	1
whale	1
carries	1
the	1
everlasting	1
mail!"	1
But	1
the	1
monster's	1
run	1
was	1
a	1
brief	1
one.	1
Giving	1
a	1
sudden	1
gasp,	1
he	1
tumultuously	1
sounded.	1
With	1
a	1
grating	1
rush,	1
the	1
three	1
lines	1
flew	1
round	1
the	1
loggerheads	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
force	1
as	1
to	1
gouge	1
deep	1
grooves	1
in	1
them;	1
while	1
so	1
fearful	1
were	1
the	1
harpooneers	1
that	1
this	1
rapid	1
sounding	1
would	1
soon	1
exhaust	1
the	1
lines,	1
that	1
using	1
all	1
their	1
dexterous	1
might,	1
they	1
caught	1
repeated	1
smoking	1
turns	1
with	1
the	1
rope	1
to	1
hold	1
on;	1
till	1
at	1
last--owing	1
to	1
the	1
perpendicular	1
strain	1
from	1
the	1
lead-lined	1
chocks	1
of	1
the	1
boats,	1
whence	1
the	1
three	1
ropes	1
went	1
straight	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
blue--the	1
gunwales	1
of	1
the	1
bows	1
were	1
almost	1
even	1
with	1
the	1
water,	1
while	1
the	1
three	1
sterns	1
tilted	1
high	1
in	1
the	1
air.	1
And	1
the	1
whale	1
soon	1
ceasing	1
to	1
sound,	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
they	1
remained	1
in	1
that	1
attitude,	1
fearful	1
of	1
expending	1
more	1
line,	1
though	1
the	1
position	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
ticklish.	1
But	1
though	1
boats	1
have	1
been	1
taken	1
down	1
and	1
lost	1
in	1
this	1
way,	1
yet	1
it	1
is	1
this	1
"holding	1
on,"	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
called;	1
this	1
hooking	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
sharp	1
barbs	1
of	1
his	1
live	1
flesh	1
from	1
the	1
back;	1
this	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
often	1
torments	1
the	1
Leviathan	1
into	1
soon	1
rising	1
again	1
to	1
meet	1
the	1
sharp	1
lance	1
of	1
his	1
foes.	1
Yet	1
not	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
the	1
peril	1
of	1
the	1
thing,	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
doubted	1
whether	1
this	1
course	1
is	1
always	1
the	1
best;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
but	1
reasonable	1
to	1
presume,	1
that	1
the	1
longer	1
the	1
stricken	1
whale	1
stays	1
under	1
water,	1
the	1
more	1
he	1
is	1
exhausted.	1
Because,	1
owing	1
to	1
the	1
enormous	1
surface	1
of	1
him--in	1
a	1
full	1
grown	1
sperm	1
whale	1
something	1
less	1
than	1
2000	1
square	1
feet--the	1
pressure	1
of	1
the	1
water	1
is	1
immense.	1
We	1
all	1
know	1
what	1
an	1
astonishing	1
atmospheric	1
weight	1
we	1
ourselves	1
stand	1
up	1
under;	1
even	1
here,	1
above-ground,	1
in	1
the	1
air;	1
how	1
vast,	1
then,	1
the	1
burden	1
of	1
a	1
whale,	1
bearing	1
on	1
his	1
back	1
a	1
column	1
of	1
two	1
hundred	1
fathoms	1
of	1
ocean!	1
It	1
must	1
at	1
least	1
equal	1
the	1
weight	1
of	1
fifty	1
atmospheres.	1
One	1
whaleman	1
has	1
estimated	1
it	1
at	1
the	1
weight	1
of	1
twenty	1
line-of-battle	1
ships,	1
with	1
all	1
their	1
guns,	1
and	1
stores,	1
and	1
men	1
on	1
board.	1
As	1
the	1
three	1
boats	1
lay	1
there	1
on	1
that	1
gently	1
rolling	1
sea,	1
gazing	1
down	1
into	1
its	1
eternal	1
blue	1
noon;	1
and	1
as	1
not	1
a	1
single	1
groan	1
or	1
cry	1
of	1
any	1
sort,	1
nay,	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
a	1
ripple	1
or	1
a	1
bubble	1
came	1
up	1
from	1
its	1
depths;	1
what	1
landsman	1
would	1
have	1
thought,	1
that	1
beneath	1
all	1
that	1
silence	1
and	1
placidity,	1
the	1
utmost	1
monster	1
of	1
the	1
seas	1
was	1
writhing	1
and	1
wrenching	1
in	1
agony!	1
Not	1
eight	1
inches	1
of	1
perpendicular	1
rope	1
were	1
visible	1
at	1
the	1
bows.	1
Seems	1
it	1
credible	1
that	1
by	1
three	1
such	1
thin	1
threads	1
the	1
great	1
Leviathan	1
was	1
suspended	1
like	1
the	1
big	1
weight	1
to	1
an	1
eight	1
day	1
clock.	1
Suspended?	1
and	1
to	1
what?	1
To	1
three	1
bits	1
of	1
board.	1
Is	1
this	1
the	1
creature	1
of	1
whom	1
it	1
was	1
once	1
so	1
triumphantly	1
said--"Canst	1
thou	1
fill	1
his	1
skin	1
with	1
barbed	1
irons?	1
or	1
his	1
head	1
with	1
fish-spears?	1
The	1
sword	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
layeth	1
at	1
him	1
cannot	1
hold,	1
the	1
spear,	1
the	1
dart,	1
nor	1
the	1
habergeon:	1
he	1
esteemeth	1
iron	1
as	1
straw;	1
the	1
arrow	1
cannot	1
make	1
him	1
flee;	1
darts	1
are	1
counted	1
as	1
stubble;	1
he	1
laugheth	1
at	1
the	1
shaking	1
of	1
a	1
spear!"	1
This	1
the	1
creature?	1
this	1
he?	1
Oh!	1
that	1
unfulfilments	1
should	1
follow	1
the	1
prophets.	1
For	1
with	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
a	1
thousand	1
thighs	1
in	1
his	1
tail,	1
Leviathan	1
had	1
run	1
his	1
head	1
under	1
the	1
mountains	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
to	1
hide	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
Pequod's	1
fish-spears!	1
In	1
that	1
sloping	1
afternoon	1
sunlight,	1
the	1
shadows	1
that	1
the	1
three	1
boats	1
sent	1
down	1
beneath	1
the	1
surface,	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
long	1
enough	1
and	1
broad	1
enough	1
to	1
shade	1
half	1
Xerxes'	1
army.	1
Who	1
can	1
tell	1
how	1
appalling	1
to	1
the	1
wounded	1
whale	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
such	1
huge	1
phantoms	1
flitting	1
over	1
his	1
head!	1
"Stand	1
by,	1
men;	1
he	1
stirs,"	1
cried	1
Starbuck,	1
as	1
the	1
three	1
lines	1
suddenly	1
vibrated	1
in	1
the	1
water,	1
distinctly	1
conducting	1
upwards	1
to	1
them,	1
as	1
by	1
magnetic	1
wires,	1
the	1
life	1
and	1
death	1
throbs	1
of	1
the	1
whale,	1
so	1
that	1
every	1
oarsman	1
felt	1
them	1
in	1
his	1
seat.	1
The	1
next	1
moment,	1
relieved	1
in	1
great	1
part	1
from	1
the	1
downward	1
strain	1
at	1
the	1
bows,	1
the	1
boats	1
gave	1
a	1
sudden	1
bounce	1
upwards,	1
as	1
a	1
small	1
icefield	1
will,	1
when	1
a	1
dense	1
herd	1
of	1
white	1
bears	1
are	1
scared	1
from	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
sea.	1
"Haul	1
in!	1
Haul	1
in!"	1
cried	1
Starbuck	1
again;	1
"he's	1
rising."	1
The	1
lines,	1
of	1
which,	1
hardly	1
an	1
instant	1
before,	1
not	1
one	1
hand's	1
breadth	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
gained,	1
were	1
now	1
in	1
long	1
quick	1
coils	1
flung	1
back	1
all	1
dripping	1
into	1
the	1
boats,	1
and	1
soon	1
the	1
whale	1
broke	1
water	1
within	1
two	1
ship's	1
lengths	1
of	1
the	1
hunters.	1
His	1
motions	1
plainly	1
denoted	1
his	1
extreme	1
exhaustion.	1
In	1
most	1
land	1
animals	1
there	1
are	1
certain	1
valves	1
or	1
flood-gates	1
in	1
many	1
of	1
their	1
veins,	1
whereby	1
when	1
wounded,	1
the	1
blood	1
is	1
in	1
some	1
degree	1
at	1
least	1
instantly	1
shut	1
off	1
in	1
certain	1
directions.	1
Not	1
so	1
with	1
the	1
whale;	1
one	1
of	1
whose	1
peculiarities	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
have	1
an	1
entire	1
non-valvular	1
structure	1
of	1
the	1
blood-vessels,	1
so	1
that	1
when	1
pierced	1
even	1
by	1
so	1
small	1
a	1
point	1
as	1
a	1
harpoon,	1
a	1
deadly	1
drain	1
is	1
at	1
once	1
begun	1
upon	1
his	1
whole	1
arterial	1
system;	1
and	1
when	1
this	1
is	1
heightened	1
by	1
the	1
extraordinary	1
pressure	1
of	1
water	1
at	1
a	1
great	1
distance	1
below	1
the	1
surface,	1
his	1
life	1
may	1
be	1
said	1
to	1
pour	1
from	1
him	1
in	1
incessant	1
streams.	1
Yet	1
so	1
vast	1
is	1
the	1
quantity	1
of	1
blood	1
in	1
him,	1
and	1
so	1
distant	1
and	1
numerous	1
its	1
interior	1
fountains,	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
keep	1
thus	1
bleeding	1
and	1
bleeding	1
for	1
a	1
considerable	1
period;	1
even	1
as	1
in	1
a	1
drought	1
a	1
river	1
will	1
flow,	1
whose	1
source	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
well-springs	1
of	1
far-off	1
and	1
undiscernible	1
hills.	1
Even	1
now,	1
when	1
the	1
boats	1
pulled	1
upon	1
this	1
whale,	1
and	1
perilously	1
drew	1
over	1
his	1
swaying	1
flukes,	1
and	1
the	1
lances	1
were	1
darted	1
into	1
him,	1
they	1
were	1
followed	1
by	1
steady	1
jets	1
from	1
the	1
new	1
made	1
wound,	1
which	1
kept	1
continually	1
playing,	1
while	1
the	1
natural	1
spout-hole	1
in	1
his	1
head	1
was	1
only	1
at	1
intervals,	1
however	1
rapid,	1
sending	1
its	1
affrighted	1
moisture	1
into	1
the	1
air.	1
From	1
this	1
last	1
vent	1
no	1
blood	1
yet	1
came,	1
because	1
no	1
vital	1
part	1
of	1
him	1
had	1
thus	1
far	1
been	1
struck.	1
His	1
life,	1
as	1
they	1
significantly	1
call	1
it,	1
was	1
untouched.	1
As	1
the	1
boats	1
now	1
more	1
closely	1
surrounded	1
him,	1
the	1
whole	1
upper	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
form,	1
with	1
much	1
of	1
it	1
that	1
is	1
ordinarily	1
submerged,	1
was	1
plainly	1
revealed.	1
His	1
eyes,	1
or	1
rather	1
the	1
places	1
where	1
his	1
eyes	1
had	1
been,	1
were	1
beheld.	1
As	1
strange	1
misgrown	1
masses	1
gather	1
in	1
the	1
knot-holes	1
of	1
the	1
noblest	1
oaks	1
when	1
prostrate,	1
so	1
from	1
the	1
points	1
which	1
the	1
whale's	1
eyes	1
had	1
once	1
occupied,	1
now	1
protruded	1
blind	1
bulbs,	1
horribly	1
pitiable	1
to	1
see.	1
But	1
pity	1
there	1
was	1
none.	1
For	1
all	1
his	1
old	1
age,	1
and	1
his	1
one	1
arm,	1
and	1
his	1
blind	1
eyes,	1
he	1
must	1
die	1
the	1
death	1
and	1
be	1
murdered,	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
light	1
the	1
gay	1
bridals	1
and	1
other	1
merry-makings	1
of	1
men,	1
and	1
also	1
to	1
illuminate	1
the	1
solemn	1
churches	1
that	1
preach	1
unconditional	1
inoffensiveness	1
by	1
all	1
to	1
all.	1
Still	1
rolling	1
in	1
his	1
blood,	1
at	1
last	1
he	1
partially	1
disclosed	1
a	1
strangely	1
discoloured	1
bunch	1
or	1
protuberance,	1
the	1
size	1
of	1
a	1
bushel,	1
low	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
flank.	1
"A	1
nice	1
spot,"	1
cried	1
Flask;	1
"just	1
let	1
me	1
prick	1
him	1
there	1
once."	1
"Avast!"	1
cried	1
Starbuck,	1
"there's	1
no	1
need	1
of	1
that!"	1
But	1
humane	1
Starbuck	1
was	1
too	1
late.	1
At	1
the	1
instant	1
of	1
the	1
dart	1
an	1
ulcerous	1
jet	1
shot	1
from	1
this	1
cruel	1
wound,	1
and	1
goaded	1
by	1
it	1
into	1
more	1
than	1
sufferable	1
anguish,	1
the	1
whale	1
now	1
spouting	1
thick	1
blood,	1
with	1
swift	1
fury	1
blindly	1
darted	1
at	1
the	1
craft,	1
bespattering	1
them	1
and	1
their	1
glorying	1
crews	1
all	1
over	1
with	1
showers	1
of	1
gore,	1
capsizing	1
Flask's	1
boat	1
and	1
marring	1
the	1
bows.	1
It	1
was	1
his	1
death	1
stroke.	1
For,	1
by	1
this	1
time,	1
so	1
spent	1
was	1
he	1
by	1
loss	1
of	1
blood,	1
that	1
he	1
helplessly	1
rolled	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
wreck	1
he	1
had	1
made;	1
lay	1
panting	1
on	1
his	1
side,	1
impotently	1
flapped	1
with	1
his	1
stumped	1
fin,	1
then	1
over	1
and	1
over	1
slowly	1
revolved	1
like	1
a	1
waning	1
world;	1
turned	1
up	1
the	1
white	1
secrets	1
of	1
his	1
belly;	1
lay	1
like	1
a	1
log,	1
and	1
died.	1
It	1
was	1
most	1
piteous,	1
that	1
last	1
expiring	1
spout.	1
As	1
when	1
by	1
unseen	1
hands	1
the	1
water	1
is	1
gradually	1
drawn	1
off	1
from	1
some	1
mighty	1
fountain,	1
and	1
with	1
half-stifled	1
melancholy	1
gurglings	1
the	1
spray-column	1
lowers	1
and	1
lowers	1
to	1
the	1
ground--so	1
the	1
last	1
long	1
dying	1
spout	1
of	1
the	1
whale.	1
Soon,	1
while	1
the	1
crews	1
were	1
awaiting	1
the	1
arrival	1
of	1
the	1
ship,	1
the	1
body	1
showed	1
symptoms	1
of	1
sinking	1
with	1
all	1
its	1
treasures	1
unrifled.	1
Immediately,	1
by	1
Starbuck's	1
orders,	1
lines	1
were	1
secured	1
to	1
it	1
at	1
different	1
points,	1
so	1
that	1
ere	1
long	1
every	1
boat	1
was	1
a	1
buoy;	1
the	1
sunken	1
whale	1
being	1
suspended	1
a	1
few	1
inches	1
beneath	1
them	1
by	1
the	1
cords.	1
By	1
very	1
heedful	1
management,	1
when	1
the	1
ship	1
drew	1
nigh,	1
the	1
whale	1
was	1
transferred	1
to	1
her	1
side,	1
and	1
was	1
strongly	1
secured	1
there	1
by	1
the	1
stiffest	1
fluke-chains,	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
plain	1
that	1
unless	1
artificially	1
upheld,	1
the	1
body	1
would	1
at	1
once	1
sink	1
to	1
the	1
bottom.	1
It	1
so	1
chanced	1
that	1
almost	1
upon	1
first	1
cutting	1
into	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
spade,	1
the	1
entire	1
length	1
of	1
a	1
corroded	1
harpoon	1
was	1
found	1
imbedded	1
in	1
his	1
flesh,	1
on	1
the	1
lower	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
bunch	1
before	1
described.	1
But	1
as	1
the	1
stumps	1
of	1
harpoons	1
are	1
frequently	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
dead	1
bodies	1
of	1
captured	1
whales,	1
with	1
the	1
flesh	1
perfectly	1
healed	1
around	1
them,	1
and	1
no	1
prominence	1
of	1
any	1
kind	1
to	1
denote	1
their	1
place;	1
therefore,	1
there	1
must	1
needs	1
have	1
been	1
some	1
other	1
unknown	1
reason	1
in	1
the	1
present	1
case	1
fully	1
to	1
account	1
for	1
the	1
ulceration	1
alluded	1
to.	1
But	1
still	1
more	1
curious	1
was	1
the	1
fact	1
of	1
a	1
lance-head	1
of	1
stone	1
being	1
found	1
in	1
him,	1
not	1
far	1
from	1
the	1
buried	1
iron,	1
the	1
flesh	1
perfectly	1
firm	1
about	1
it.	1
Who	1
had	1
darted	1
that	1
stone	1
lance?	1
And	1
when?	1
It	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
darted	1
by	1
some	1
Nor'	1
West	1
Indian	1
long	1
before	1
America	1
was	1
discovered.	1
What	1
other	1
marvels	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
rummaged	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
monstrous	1
cabinet	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
telling.	1
But	1
a	1
sudden	1
stop	1
was	1
put	1
to	1
further	1
discoveries,	1
by	1
the	1
ship's	1
being	1
unprecedentedly	1
dragged	1
over	1
sideways	1
to	1
the	1
sea,	1
owing	1
to	1
the	1
body's	1
immensely	1
increasing	1
tendency	1
to	1
sink.	1
However,	1
Starbuck,	1
who	1
had	1
the	1
ordering	1
of	1
affairs,	1
hung	1
on	1
to	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
last;	1
hung	1
on	1
to	1
it	1
so	1
resolutely,	1
indeed,	1
that	1
when	1
at	1
length	1
the	1
ship	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
capsized,	1
if	1
still	1
persisting	1
in	1
locking	1
arms	1
with	1
the	1
body;	1
then,	1
when	1
the	1
command	1
was	1
given	1
to	1
break	1
clear	1
from	1
it,	1
such	1
was	1
the	1
immovable	1
strain	1
upon	1
the	1
timber-heads	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
fluke-chains	1
and	1
cables	1
were	1
fastened,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
cast	1
them	1
off.	1
Meantime	1
everything	1
in	1
the	1
Pequod	1
was	1
aslant.	1
To	1
cross	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
deck	1
was	1
like	1
walking	1
up	1
the	1
steep	1
gabled	1
roof	1
of	1
a	1
house.	1
The	1
ship	1
groaned	1
and	1
gasped.	1
Many	1
of	1
the	1
ivory	1
inlayings	1
of	1
her	1
bulwarks	1
and	1
cabins	1
were	1
started	1
from	1
their	1
places,	1
by	1
the	1
unnatural	1
dislocation.	1
In	1
vain	1
handspikes	1
and	1
crows	1
were	1
brought	1
to	1
bear	1
upon	1
the	1
immovable	1
fluke-chains,	1
to	1
pry	1
them	1
adrift	1
from	1
the	1
timberheads;	1
and	1
so	1
low	1
had	1
the	1
whale	1
now	1
settled	1
that	1
the	1
submerged	1
ends	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
at	1
all	1
approached,	1
while	1
every	1
moment	1
whole	1
tons	1
of	1
ponderosity	1
seemed	1
added	1
to	1
the	1
sinking	1
bulk,	1
and	1
the	1
ship	1
seemed	1
on	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
going	1
over.	1
"Hold	1
on,	1
hold	1
on,	1
won't	1
ye?"	1
cried	1
Stubb	1
to	1
the	1
body,	1
"don't	1
be	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
devil	1
of	1
a	1
hurry	1
to	1
sink!	1
By	1
thunder,	1
men,	1
we	1
must	1
do	1
something	1
or	1
go	1
for	1
it.	1
No	1
use	1
prying	1
there;	1
avast,	1
I	1
say	1
with	1
your	1
handspikes,	1
and	1
run	1
one	1
of	1
ye	1
for	1
a	1
prayer	1
book	1
and	1
a	1
pen-knife,	1
and	1
cut	1
the	1
big	1
chains."	1
"Knife?	1
Aye,	1
aye,"	1
cried	1
Queequeg,	1
and	1
seizing	1
the	1
carpenter's	1
heavy	1
hatchet,	1
he	1
leaned	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
porthole,	1
and	1
steel	1
to	1
iron,	1
began	1
slashing	1
at	1
the	1
largest	1
fluke-chains.	1
But	1
a	1
few	1
strokes,	1
full	1
of	1
sparks,	1
were	1
given,	1
when	1
the	1
exceeding	1
strain	1
effected	1
the	1
rest.	1
With	1
a	1
terrific	1
snap,	1
every	1
fastening	1
went	1
adrift;	1
the	1
ship	1
righted,	1
the	1
carcase	1
sank.	1
Now,	1
this	1
occasional	1
inevitable	1
sinking	1
of	1
the	1
recently	1
killed	1
Sperm	1
Whale	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
curious	1
thing;	1
nor	1
has	1
any	1
fisherman	1
yet	1
adequately	1
accounted	1
for	1
it.	1
Usually	1
the	1
dead	1
Sperm	1
Whale	1
floats	1
with	1
great	1
buoyancy,	1
with	1
its	1
side	1
or	1
belly	1
considerably	1
elevated	1
above	1
the	1
surface.	1
If	1
the	1
only	1
whales	1
that	1
thus	1
sank	1
were	1
old,	1
meagre,	1
and	1
broken-hearted	1
creatures,	1
their	1
pads	1
of	1
lard	1
diminished	1
and	1
all	1
their	1
bones	1
heavy	1
and	1
rheumatic;	1
then	1
you	1
might	1
with	1
some	1
reason	1
assert	1
that	1
this	1
sinking	1
is	1
caused	1
by	1
an	1
uncommon	1
specific	1
gravity	1
in	1
the	1
fish	1
so	1
sinking,	1
consequent	1
upon	1
this	1
absence	1
of	1
buoyant	1
matter	1
in	1
him.	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
so.	1
For	1
young	1
whales,	1
in	1
the	1
highest	1
health,	1
and	1
swelling	1
with	1
noble	1
aspirations,	1
prematurely	1
cut	1
off	1
in	1
the	1
warm	1
flush	1
and	1
May	1
of	1
life,	1
with	1
all	1
their	1
panting	1
lard	1
about	1
them;	1
even	1
these	1
brawny,	1
buoyant	1
heroes	1
do	1
sometimes	1
sink.	1
Be	1
it	1
said,	1
however,	1
that	1
the	1
Sperm	1
Whale	1
is	1
far	1
less	1
liable	1
to	1
this	1
accident	1
than	1
any	1
other	1
species.	1
Where	1
one	1
of	1
that	1
sort	1
go	1
down,	1
twenty	1
Right	1
Whales	1
do.	1
This	1
difference	1
in	1
the	1
species	1
is	1
no	1
doubt	1
imputable	1
in	1
no	1
small	1
degree	1
to	1
the	1
greater	1
quantity	1
of	1
bone	1
in	1
the	1
Right	1
Whale;	1
his	1
Venetian	1
blinds	1
alone	1
sometimes	1
weighing	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
ton;	1
from	1
this	1
incumbrance	1
the	1
Sperm	1
Whale	1
is	1
wholly	1
free.	1
But	1
there	1
are	1
instances	1
where,	1
after	1
the	1
lapse	1
of	1
many	1
hours	1
or	1
several	1
days,	1
the	1
sunken	1
whale	1
again	1
rises,	1
more	1
buoyant	1
than	1
in	1
life.	1
But	1
the	1
reason	1
of	1
this	1
is	1
obvious.	1
Gases	1
are	1
generated	1
in	1
him;	1
he	1
swells	1
to	1
a	1
prodigious	1
magnitude;	1
becomes	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
animal	1
balloon.	1
A	1
line-of-battle	1
ship	1
could	1
hardly	1
keep	1
him	1
under	1
then.	1
In	1
the	1
Shore	1
Whaling,	1
on	1
soundings,	1
among	1
the	1
Bays	1
of	1
New	1
Zealand,	1
when	1
a	1
Right	1
Whale	1
gives	1
token	1
of	1
sinking,	1
they	1
fasten	1
buoys	1
to	1
him,	1
with	1
plenty	1
of	1
rope;	1
so	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
body	1
has	1
gone	1
down,	1
they	1
know	1
where	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
it	1
when	1
it	1
shall	1
have	1
ascended	1
again.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
long	1
after	1
the	1
sinking	1
of	1
the	1
body	1
that	1
a	1
cry	1
was	1
heard	1
from	1
the	1
Pequod's	1
mast-heads,	1
announcing	1
that	1
the	1
Jungfrau	1
was	1
again	1
lowering	1
her	1
boats;	1
though	1
the	1
only	1
spout	1
in	1
sight	1
was	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
Fin-Back,	1
belonging	1
to	1
the	1
species	1
of	1
uncapturable	1
whales,	1
because	1
of	1
its	1
incredible	1
power	1
of	1
swimming.	1
Nevertheless,	1
the	1
Fin-Back's	1
spout	1
is	1
so	1
similar	1
to	1
the	1
Sperm	1
Whale's,	1
that	1
by	1
unskilful	1
fishermen	1
it	1
is	1
often	1
mistaken	1
for	1
it.	1
And	1
consequently	1
Derick	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
host	1
were	1
now	1
in	1
valiant	1
chase	1
of	1
this	1
unnearable	1
brute.	1
The	1
Virgin	1
crowding	1
all	1
sail,	1
made	1
after	1
her	1
four	1
young	1
keels,	1
and	1
thus	1
they	1
all	1
disappeared	1
far	1
to	1
leeward,	1
still	1
in	1
bold,	1
hopeful	1
chase.	1
Oh!	1
many	1
are	1
the	1
Fin-Backs,	1
and	1
many	1
are	1
the	1
Dericks,	1
my	1
friend.	1
CHAPTER	1
82	1
The	1
Honour	1
and	1
Glory	1
of	1
Whaling.	1
There	1
are	1
some	1
enterprises	1
in	1
which	1
a	1
careful	1
disorderliness	1
is	1
the	1
true	1
method.	1
The	1
more	1
I	1
dive	1
into	1
this	1
matter	1
of	1
whaling,	1
and	1
push	1
my	1
researches	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
very	1
spring-head	1
of	1
it	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
more	1
am	1
I	1
impressed	1
with	1
its	1
great	1
honourableness	1
and	1
antiquity;	1
and	1
especially	1
when	1
I	1
find	1
so	1
many	1
great	1
demi-gods	1
and	1
heroes,	1
prophets	1
of	1
all	1
sorts,	1
who	1
one	1
way	1
or	1
other	1
have	1
shed	1
distinction	1
upon	1
it,	1
I	1
am	1
transported	1
with	1
the	1
reflection	1
that	1
I	1
myself	1
belong,	1
though	1
but	1
subordinately,	1
to	1
so	1
emblazoned	1
a	1
fraternity.	1
The	1
gallant	1
Perseus,	1
a	1
son	1
of	1
Jupiter,	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
whaleman;	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
eternal	1
honour	1
of	1
our	1
calling	1
be	1
it	1
said,	1
that	1
the	1
first	1
whale	1
attacked	1
by	1
our	1
brotherhood	1
was	1
not	1
killed	1
with	1
any	1
sordid	1
intent.	1
Those	1
were	1
the	1
knightly	1
days	1
of	1
our	1
profession,	1
when	1
we	1
only	1
bore	1
arms	1
to	1
succor	1
the	1
distressed,	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
fill	1
men's	1
lamp-feeders.	1
Every	1
one	1
knows	1
the	1
fine	1
story	1
of	1
Perseus	1
and	1
Andromeda;	1
how	1
the	1
lovely	1
Andromeda,	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
a	1
king,	1
was	1
tied	1
to	1
a	1
rock	1
on	1
the	1
sea-coast,	1
and	1
as	1
Leviathan	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
act	1
of	1
carrying	1
her	1
off,	1
Perseus,	1
the	1
prince	1
of	1
whalemen,	1
intrepidly	1
advancing,	1
harpooned	1
the	1
monster,	1
and	1
delivered	1
and	1
married	1
the	1
maid.	1
It	1
was	1
an	1
admirable	1
artistic	1
exploit,	1
rarely	1
achieved	1
by	1
the	1
best	1
harpooneers	1
of	1
the	1
present	1
day;	1
inasmuch	1
as	1
this	1
Leviathan	1
was	1
slain	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
first	1
dart.	1
And	1
let	1
no	1
man	1
doubt	1
this	1
Arkite	1
story;	1
for	1
in	1
the	1
ancient	1
Joppa,	1
now	1
Jaffa,	1
on	1
the	1
Syrian	1
coast,	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
Pagan	1
temples,	1
there	1
stood	1
for	1
many	1
ages	1
the	1
vast	1
skeleton	1
of	1
a	1
whale,	1
which	1
the	1
city's	1
legends	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
asserted	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
identical	1
bones	1
of	1
the	1
monster	1
that	1
Perseus	1
slew.	1
When	1
the	1
Romans	1
took	1
Joppa,	1
the	1
same	1
skeleton	1
was	1
carried	1
to	1
Italy	1
in	1
triumph.	1
What	1
seems	1
most	1
singular	1
and	1
suggestively	1
important	1
in	1
this	1
story,	1
is	1
this:	1
it	1
was	1
from	1
Joppa	1
that	1
Jonah	1
set	1
sail.	1
Akin	1
to	1
the	1
adventure	1
of	1
Perseus	1
and	1
Andromeda--indeed,	1
by	1
some	1
supposed	1
to	1
be	1
indirectly	1
derived	1
from	1
it--is	1
that	1
famous	1
story	1
of	1
St.	1
George	1
and	1
the	1
Dragon;	1
which	1
dragon	1
I	1
maintain	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
whale;	1
for	1
in	1
many	1
old	1
chronicles	1
whales	1
and	1
dragons	1
are	1
strangely	1
jumbled	1
together,	1
and	1
often	1
stand	1
for	1
each	1
other.	1
"Thou	1
art	1
as	1
a	1
lion	1
of	1
the	1
waters,	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
dragon	1
of	1
the	1
sea,"	1
saith	1
Ezekiel;	1
hereby,	1
plainly	1
meaning	1
a	1
whale;	1
in	1
truth,	1
some	1
versions	1
of	1
the	1
Bible	1
use	1
that	1
word	1
itself.	1
Besides,	1
it	1
would	1
much	1
subtract	1
from	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
exploit	1
had	1
St.	1
George	1
but	1
encountered	1
a	1
crawling	1
reptile	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
instead	1
of	1
doing	1
battle	1
with	1
the	1
great	1
monster	1
of	1
the	1
deep.	1
Any	1
man	1
may	1
kill	1
a	1
snake,	1
but	1
only	1
a	1
Perseus,	1
a	1
St.	1
George,	1
a	1
Coffin,	1
have	1
the	1
heart	1
in	1
them	1
to	1
march	1
boldly	1
up	1
to	1
a	1
whale.	1
Let	1
not	1
the	1
modern	1
paintings	1
of	1
this	1
scene	1
mislead	1
us;	1
for	1
though	1
the	1
creature	1
encountered	1
by	1
that	1
valiant	1
whaleman	1
of	1
old	1
is	1
vaguely	1
represented	1
of	1
a	1
griffin-like	1
shape,	1
and	1
though	1
the	1
battle	1
is	1
depicted	1
on	1
land	1
and	1
the	1
saint	1
on	1
horseback,	1
yet	1
considering	1
the	1
great	1
ignorance	1
of	1
those	1
times,	1
when	1
the	1
true	1
form	1
of	1
the	1
whale	1
was	1
unknown	1
to	1
artists;	1
and	1
considering	1
that	1
as	1
in	1
Perseus'	1
case,	1
St.	1
George's	1
whale	1
might	1
have	1
crawled	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
on	1
the	1
beach;	1
and	1
considering	1
that	1
the	1
animal	1
ridden	1
by	1
St.	1
George	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
only	1
a	1
large	1
seal,	1
or	1
sea-horse;	1
bearing	1
all	1
this	1
in	1
mind,	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
appear	1
altogether	1
incompatible	1
with	1
the	1
sacred	1
legend	1
and	1
the	1
ancientest	1
draughts	1
of	1
the	1
scene,	1
to	1
hold	1
this	1
so-called	1
dragon	1
no	1
other	1
than	1
the	1
great	1
Leviathan	1
himself.	1
In	1
fact,	1
placed	1
before	1
the	1
strict	1
and	1
piercing	1
truth,	1
this	1
whole	1
story	1
will	1
fare	1
like	1
that	1
fish,	1
flesh,	1
and	1
fowl	1
idol	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
Dagon	1
by	1
name;	1
who	1
being	1
planted	1
before	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
Israel,	1
his	1
horse's	1
head	1
and	1
both	1
the	1
palms	1
of	1
his	1
hands	1
fell	1
off	1
from	1
him,	1
and	1
only	1
the	1
stump	1
or	1
fishy	1
part	1
of	1
him	1
remained.	1
Thus,	1
then,	1
one	1
of	1
our	1
own	1
noble	1
stamp,	1
even	1
a	1
whaleman,	1
is	1
the	1
tutelary	1
guardian	1
of	1
England;	1
and	1
by	1
good	1
rights,	1
we	1
harpooneers	1
of	1
Nantucket	1
should	1
be	1
enrolled	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
noble	1
order	1
of	1
St.	1
George.	1
And	1
therefore,	1
let	1
not	1
the	1
knights	1
of	1
that	1
honourable	1
company	1
(none	1
of	1
whom,	1
I	1
venture	1
to	1
say,	1
have	1
ever	1
had	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
a	1
whale	1
like	1
their	1
great	1
patron),	1
let	1
them	1
never	1
eye	1
a	1
Nantucketer	1
with	1
disdain,	1
since	1
even	1
in	1
our	1
woollen	1
frocks	1
and	1
tarred	1
trowsers	1
we	1
are	1
much	1
better	1
entitled	1
to	1
St.	1
George's	1
decoration	1
than	1
they.	1
Whether	1
to	1
admit	1
Hercules	1
among	1
us	1
or	1
not,	1
concerning	1
this	1
I	1
long	1
remained	1
dubious:	1
for	1
though	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
Greek	1
mythologies,	1
that	1
antique	1
Crockett	1
and	1
Kit	1
Carson--that	1
brawny	1
doer	1
of	1
rejoicing	1
good	1
deeds,	1
was	1
swallowed	1
down	1
and	1
thrown	1
up	1
by	1
a	1
whale;	1
still,	1
whether	1
that	1
strictly	1
makes	1
a	1
whaleman	1
of	1
him,	1
that	1
might	1
be	1
mooted.	1
It	1
nowhere	1
appears	1
that	1
he	1
ever	1
actually	1
harpooned	1
his	1
fish,	1
unless,	1
indeed,	1
from	1
the	1
inside.	1
Nevertheless,	1
he	1
may	1
be	1
deemed	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
involuntary	1
whaleman;	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
the	1
whale	1
caught	1
him,	1
if	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
the	1
whale.	1
I	1
claim	1
him	1
for	1
one	1
of	1
our	1
clan.	1
But,	1
by	1
the	1
best	1
contradictory	1
authorities,	1
this	1
Grecian	1
story	1
of	1
Hercules	1
and	1
the	1
whale	1
is	1
considered	1
to	1
be	1
derived	1
from	1
the	1
still	1
more	1
ancient	1
Hebrew	1
story	1
of	1
Jonah	1
and	1
the	1
whale;	1
and	1
vice	1
versa;	1
certainly	1
they	1
are	1
very	1
similar.	1
If	1
I	1
claim	1
the	1
demigod	1
then,	1
why	1
not	1
the	1
prophet?	1
Nor	1
do	1
heroes,	1
saints,	1
demigods,	1
and	1
prophets	1
alone	1
comprise	1
the	1
whole	1
roll	1
of	1
our	1
order.	1
Our	1
grand	1
master	1
is	1
still	1
to	1
be	1
named;	1
for	1
like	1
royal	1
kings	1
of	1
old	1
times,	1
we	1
find	1
the	1
head	1
waters	1
of	1
our	1
fraternity	1
in	1
nothing	1
short	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
gods	1
themselves.	1
That	1
wondrous	1
oriental	1
story	1
is	1
now	1
to	1
be	1
rehearsed	1
from	1
the	1
Shaster,	1
which	1
gives	1
us	1
the	1
dread	1
Vishnoo,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
three	1
persons	1
in	1
the	1
godhead	1
of	1
the	1
Hindoos;	1
gives	1
us	1
this	1
divine	1
Vishnoo	1
himself	1
for	1
our	1
Lord;--Vishnoo,	1
who,	1
by	1
the	1
first	1
of	1
his	1
ten	1
earthly	1
incarnations,	1
has	1
for	1
ever	1
set	1
apart	1
and	1
sanctified	1
the	1
whale.	1
When	1
Brahma,	1
or	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Gods,	1
saith	1
the	1
Shaster,	1
resolved	1
to	1
recreate	1
the	1
world	1
after	1
one	1
of	1
its	1
periodical	1
dissolutions,	1
he	1
gave	1
birth	1
to	1
Vishnoo,	1
to	1
preside	1
over	1
the	1
work;	1
but	1
the	1
Vedas,	1
or	1
mystical	1
books,	1
whose	1
perusal	1
would	1
seem	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
indispensable	1
to	1
Vishnoo	1
before	1
beginning	1
the	1
creation,	1
and	1
which	1
therefore	1
must	1
have	1
contained	1
something	1
in	1
the	1
shape	1
of	1
practical	1
hints	1
to	1
young	1
architects,	1
these	1
Vedas	1
were	1
lying	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
waters;	1
so	1
Vishnoo	1
became	1
incarnate	1
in	1
a	1
whale,	1
and	1
sounding	1
down	1
in	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
uttermost	1
depths,	1
rescued	1
the	1
sacred	1
volumes.	1
Was	1
not	1
this	1
Vishnoo	1
a	1
whaleman,	1
then?	1
even	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
rides	1
a	1
horse	1
is	1
called	1
a	1
horseman?	1
Perseus,	1
St.	1
George,	1
Hercules,	1
Jonah,	1
and	1
Vishnoo!	1
there's	1
a	1
member-roll	1
for	1
you!	1
What	1
club	1
but	1
the	1
whaleman's	1
can	1
head	1
off	1
like	1
that?	1
CHAPTER	1
83	1
Jonah	1
Historically	1
Regarded.	1
Reference	1
was	1
made	1
to	1
the	1
historical	1
story	1
of	1
Jonah	1
and	1
the	1
whale	1
in	1
the	1
preceding	1
chapter.	1
Now	1
some	1
Nantucketers	1
rather	1
distrust	1
this	1
historical	1
story	1
of	1
Jonah	1
and	1
the	1
whale.	1
But	1
then	1
there	1
were	1
some	1
sceptical	1
Greeks	1
and	1
Romans,	1
who,	1
standing	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
orthodox	1
pagans	1
of	1
their	1
times,	1
equally	1
doubted	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
Hercules	1
and	1
the	1
whale,	1
and	1
Arion	1
and	1
the	1
dolphin;	1
and	1
yet	1
their	1
doubting	1
those	1
traditions	1
did	1
not	1
make	1
those	1
traditions	1
one	1
whit	1
the	1
less	1
facts,	1
for	1
all	1
that.	1
One	1
old	1
Sag-Harbor	1
whaleman's	1
chief	1
reason	1
for	1
questioning	1
the	1
Hebrew	1
story	1
was	1
this:--He	1
had	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
quaint	1
old-fashioned	1
Bibles,	1
embellished	1
with	1
curious,	1
unscientific	1
plates;	1
one	1
of	1
which	1
represented	1
Jonah's	1
whale	1
with	1
two	1
spouts	1
in	1
his	1
head--a	1
peculiarity	1
only	1
true	1
with	1
respect	1
to	1
a	1
species	1
of	1
the	1
Leviathan	1
(the	1
Right	1
Whale,	1
and	1
the	1
varieties	1
of	1
that	1
order),	1
concerning	1
which	1
the	1
fishermen	1
have	1
this	1
saying,	1
"A	1
penny	1
roll	1
would	1
choke	1
him";	1
his	1
swallow	1
is	1
so	1
very	1
small.	1
But,	1
to	1
this,	1
Bishop	1
Jebb's	1
anticipative	1
answer	1
is	1
ready.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
necessary,	1
hints	1
the	1
Bishop,	1
that	1
we	1
consider	1
Jonah	1
as	1
tombed	1
in	1
the	1
whale's	1
belly,	1
but	1
as	1
temporarily	1
lodged	1
in	1
some	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
mouth.	1
And	1
this	1
seems	1
reasonable	1
enough	1
in	1
the	1
good	1
Bishop.	1
For	1
truly,	1
the	1
Right	1
Whale's	1
mouth	1
would	1
accommodate	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
whist-tables,	1
and	1
comfortably	1
seat	1
all	1
the	1
players.	1
Possibly,	1
too,	1
Jonah	1
might	1
have	1
ensconced	1
himself	1
in	1
a	1
hollow	1
tooth;	1
but,	1
on	1
second	1
thoughts,	1
the	1
Right	1
Whale	1
is	1
toothless.	1
Another	1
reason	1
which	1
Sag-Harbor	1
(he	1
went	1
by	1
that	1
name)	1
urged	1
for	1
his	1
want	1
of	1
faith	1
in	1
this	1
matter	1
of	1
the	1
prophet,	1
was	1
something	1
obscurely	1
in	1
reference	1
to	1
his	1
incarcerated	1
body	1
and	1
the	1
whale's	1
gastric	1
juices.	1
But	1
this	1
objection	1
likewise	1
falls	1
to	1
the	1
ground,	1
because	1
a	1
German	1
exegetist	1
supposes	1
that	1
Jonah	1
must	1
have	1
taken	1
refuge	1
in	1
the	1
floating	1
body	1
of	1
a	1
DEAD	1
whale--even	1
as	1
the	1
French	1
soldiers	1
in	1
the	1
Russian	1
campaign	1
turned	1
their	1
dead	1
horses	1
into	1
tents,	1
and	1
crawled	1
into	1
them.	1
Besides,	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
divined	1
by	1
other	1
continental	1
commentators,	1
that	1
when	1
Jonah	1
was	1
thrown	1
overboard	1
from	1
the	1
Joppa	1
ship,	1
he	1
straightway	1
effected	1
his	1
escape	1
to	1
another	1
vessel	1
near	1
by,	1
some	1
vessel	1
with	1
a	1
whale	1
for	1
a	1
figure-head;	1
and,	1
I	1
would	1
add,	1
possibly	1
called	1
"The	1
Whale,"	1
as	1
some	1
craft	1
are	1
nowadays	1
christened	1
the	1
"Shark,"	1
the	1
"Gull,"	1
the	1
"Eagle."	1
Nor	1
have	1
there	1
been	1
wanting	1
learned	1
exegetists	1
who	1
have	1
opined	1
that	1
the	1
whale	1
mentioned	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
Jonah	1
merely	1
meant	1
a	1
life-preserver--an	1
inflated	1
bag	1
of	1
wind--which	1
the	1
endangered	1
prophet	1
swam	1
to,	1
and	1
so	1
was	1
saved	1
from	1
a	1
watery	1
doom.	1
Poor	1
Sag-Harbor,	1
therefore,	1
seems	1
worsted	1
all	1
round.	1
But	1
he	1
had	1
still	1
another	1
reason	1
for	1
his	1
want	1
of	1
faith.	1
It	1
was	1
this,	1
if	1
I	1
remember	1
right:	1
Jonah	1
was	1
swallowed	1
by	1
the	1
whale	1
in	1
the	1
Mediterranean	1
Sea,	1
and	1
after	1
three	1
days	1
he	1
was	1
vomited	1
up	1
somewhere	1
within	1
three	1
days'	1
journey	1
of	1
Nineveh,	1
a	1
city	1
on	1
the	1
Tigris,	1
very	1
much	1
more	1
than	1
three	1
days'	1
journey	1
across	1
from	1
the	1
nearest	1
point	1
of	1
the	1
Mediterranean	1
coast.	1
How	1
is	1
that?	1
But	1
was	1
there	1
no	1
other	1
way	1
for	1
the	1
whale	1
to	1
land	1
the	1
prophet	1
within	1
that	1
short	1
distance	1
of	1
Nineveh?	1
Yes.	1
He	1
might	1
have	1
carried	1
him	1
round	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
Cape	1
of	1
Good	1
Hope.	1
But	1
not	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
the	1
passage	1
through	1
the	1
whole	1
length	1
of	1
the	1
Mediterranean,	1
and	1
another	1
passage	1
up	1
the	1
Persian	1
Gulf	1
and	1
Red	1
Sea,	1
such	1
a	1
supposition	1
would	1
involve	1
the	1
complete	1
circumnavigation	1
of	1
all	1
Africa	1
in	1
three	1
days,	1
not	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
the	1
Tigris	1
waters,	1
near	1
the	1
site	1
of	1
Nineveh,	1
being	1
too	1
shallow	1
for	1
any	1
whale	1
to	1
swim	1
in.	1
Besides,	1
this	1
idea	1
of	1
Jonah's	1
weathering	1
the	1
Cape	1
of	1
Good	1
Hope	1
at	1
so	1
early	1
a	1
day	1
would	1
wrest	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
the	1
discovery	1
of	1
that	1
great	1
headland	1
from	1
Bartholomew	1
Diaz,	1
its	1
reputed	1
discoverer,	1
and	1
so	1
make	1
modern	1
history	1
a	1
liar.	1
But	1
all	1
these	1
foolish	1
arguments	1
of	1
old	1
Sag-Harbor	1
only	1
evinced	1
his	1
foolish	1
pride	1
of	1
reason--a	1
thing	1
still	1
more	1
reprehensible	1
in	1
him,	1
seeing	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
but	1
little	1
learning	1
except	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
picked	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
sun	1
and	1
the	1
sea.	1
I	1
say	1
it	1
only	1
shows	1
his	1
foolish,	1
impious	1
pride,	1
and	1
abominable,	1
devilish	1
rebellion	1
against	1
the	1
reverend	1
clergy.	1
For	1
by	1
a	1
Portuguese	1
Catholic	1
priest,	1
this	1
very	1
idea	1
of	1
Jonah's	1
going	1
to	1
Nineveh	1
via	1
the	1
Cape	1
of	1
Good	1
Hope	1
was	1
advanced	1
as	1
a	1
signal	1
magnification	1
of	1
the	1
general	1
miracle.	1
And	1
so	1
it	1
was.	1
Besides,	1
to	1
this	1
day,	1
the	1
highly	1
enlightened	1
Turks	1
devoutly	1
believe	1
in	1
the	1
historical	1
story	1
of	1
Jonah.	1
And	1
some	1
three	1
centuries	1
ago,	1
an	1
English	1
traveller	1
in	1
old	1
Harris's	1
Voyages,	1
speaks	1
of	1
a	1
Turkish	1
Mosque	1
built	1
in	1
honour	1
of	1
Jonah,	1
in	1
which	1
Mosque	1
was	1
a	1
miraculous	1
lamp	1
that	1
burnt	1
without	1
any	1
oil.	1
CHAPTER	1
84	1
Pitchpoling.	1
To	1
make	1
them	1
run	1
easily	1
and	1
swiftly,	1
the	1
axles	1
of	1
carriages	1
are	1
anointed;	1
and	1
for	1
much	1
the	1
same	1
purpose,	1
some	1
whalers	1
perform	1
an	1
analogous	1
operation	1
upon	1
their	1
boat;	1
they	1
grease	1
the	1
bottom.	1
Nor	1
is	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
doubted	1
that	1
as	1
such	1
a	1
procedure	1
can	1
do	1
no	1
harm,	1
it	1
may	1
possibly	1
be	1
of	1
no	1
contemptible	1
advantage;	1
considering	1
that	1
oil	1
and	1
water	1
are	1
hostile;	1
that	1
oil	1
is	1
a	1
sliding	1
thing,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
object	1
in	1
view	1
is	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
boat	1
slide	1
bravely.	1
Queequeg	1
believed	1
strongly	1
in	1
anointing	1
his	1
boat,	1
and	1
one	1
morning	1
not	1
long	1
after	1
the	1
German	1
ship	1
Jungfrau	1
disappeared,	1
took	1
more	1
than	1
customary	1
pains	1
in	1
that	1
occupation;	1
crawling	1
under	1
its	1
bottom,	1
where	1
it	1
hung	1
over	1
the	1
side,	1
and	1
rubbing	1
in	1
the	1
unctuousness	1
as	1
though	1
diligently	1
seeking	1
to	1
insure	1
a	1
crop	1
of	1
hair	1
from	1
the	1
craft's	1
bald	1
keel.	1
He	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
working	1
in	1
obedience	1
to	1
some	1
particular	1
presentiment.	1
Nor	1
did	1
it	1
remain	1
unwarranted	1
by	1
the	1
event.	1
Towards	1
noon	1
whales	1
were	1
raised;	1
but	1
so	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
ship	1
sailed	1
down	1
to	1
them,	1
they	1
turned	1
and	1
fled	1
with	1
swift	1
precipitancy;	1
a	1
disordered	1
flight,	1
as	1
of	1
Cleopatra's	1
barges	1
from	1
Actium.	1
Nevertheless,	1
the	1
boats	1
pursued,	1
and	1
Stubb's	1
was	1
foremost.	1
By	1
great	1
exertion,	1
Tashtego	1
at	1
last	1
succeeded	1
in	1
planting	1
one	1
iron;	1
but	1
the	1
stricken	1
whale,	1
without	1
at	1
all	1
sounding,	1
still	1
continued	1
his	1
horizontal	1
flight,	1
with	1
added	1
fleetness.	1
Such	1
unintermitted	1
strainings	1
upon	1
the	1
planted	1
iron	1
must	1
sooner	1
or	1
later	1
inevitably	1
extract	1
it.	1
It	1
became	1
imperative	1
to	1
lance	1
the	1
flying	1
whale,	1
or	1
be	1
content	1
to	1
lose	1
him.	1
But	1
to	1
haul	1
the	1
boat	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
flank	1
was	1
impossible,	1
he	1
swam	1
so	1
fast	1
and	1
furious.	1
What	1
then	1
remained?	1
Of	1
all	1
the	1
wondrous	1
devices	1
and	1
dexterities,	1
the	1
sleights	1
of	1
hand	1
and	1
countless	1
subtleties,	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
veteran	1
whaleman	1
is	1
so	1
often	1
forced,	1
none	1
exceed	1
that	1
fine	1
manoeuvre	1
with	1
the	1
lance	1
called	1
pitchpoling.	1
Small	1
sword,	1
or	1
broad	1
sword,	1
in	1
all	1
its	1
exercises	1
boasts	1
nothing	1
like	1
it.	1
It	1
is	1
only	1
indispensable	1
with	1
an	1
inveterate	1
running	1
whale;	1
its	1
grand	1
fact	1
and	1
feature	1
is	1
the	1
wonderful	1
distance	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
long	1
lance	1
is	1
accurately	1
darted	1
from	1
a	1
violently	1
rocking,	1
jerking	1
boat,	1
under	1
extreme	1
headway.	1
Steel	1
and	1
wood	1
included,	1
the	1
entire	1
spear	1
is	1
some	1
ten	1
or	1
twelve	1
feet	1
in	1
length;	1
the	1
staff	1
is	1
much	1
slighter	1
than	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
harpoon,	1
and	1
also	1
of	1
a	1
lighter	1
material--pine.	1
It	1
is	1
furnished	1
with	1
a	1
small	1
rope	1
called	1
a	1
warp,	1
of	1
considerable	1
length,	1
by	1
which	1
it	1
can	1
be	1
hauled	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
hand	1
after	1
darting.	1
But	1
before	1
going	1
further,	1
it	1
is	1
important	1
to	1
mention	1
here,	1
that	1
though	1
the	1
harpoon	1
may	1
be	1
pitchpoled	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
with	1
the	1
lance,	1
yet	1
it	1
is	1
seldom	1
done;	1
and	1
when	1
done,	1
is	1
still	1
less	1
frequently	1
successful,	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
greater	1
weight	1
and	1
inferior	1
length	1
of	1
the	1
harpoon	1
as	1
compared	1
with	1
the	1
lance,	1
which	1
in	1
effect	1
become	1
serious	1
drawbacks.	1
As	1
a	1
general	1
thing,	1
therefore,	1
you	1
must	1
first	1
get	1
fast	1
to	1
a	1
whale,	1
before	1
any	1
pitchpoling	1
comes	1
into	1
play.	1
Look	1
now	1
at	1
Stubb;	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
from	1
his	1
humorous,	1
deliberate	1
coolness	1
and	1
equanimity	1
in	1
the	1
direst	1
emergencies,	1
was	1
specially	1
qualified	1
to	1
excel	1
in	1
pitchpoling.	1
Look	1
at	1
him;	1
he	1
stands	1
upright	1
in	1
the	1
tossed	1
bow	1
of	1
the	1
flying	1
boat;	1
wrapt	1
in	1
fleecy	1
foam,	1
the	1
towing	1
whale	1
is	1
forty	1
feet	1
ahead.	1
Handling	1
the	1
long	1
lance	1
lightly,	1
glancing	1
twice	1
or	1
thrice	1
along	1
its	1
length	1
to	1
see	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
exactly	1
straight,	1
Stubb	1
whistlingly	1
gathers	1
up	1
the	1
coil	1
of	1
the	1
warp	1
in	1
one	1
hand,	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
secure	1
its	1
free	1
end	1
in	1
his	1
grasp,	1
leaving	1
the	1
rest	1
unobstructed.	1
Then	1
holding	1
the	1
lance	1
full	1
before	1
his	1
waistband's	1
middle,	1
he	1
levels	1
it	1
at	1
the	1
whale;	1
when,	1
covering	1
him	1
with	1
it,	1
he	1
steadily	1
depresses	1
the	1
butt-end	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
thereby	1
elevating	1
the	1
point	1
till	1
the	1
weapon	1
stands	1
fairly	1
balanced	1
upon	1
his	1
palm,	1
fifteen	1
feet	1
in	1
the	1
air.	1
He	1
minds	1
you	1
somewhat	1
of	1
a	1
juggler,	1
balancing	1
a	1
long	1
staff	1
on	1
his	1
chin.	1
Next	1
moment	1
with	1
a	1
rapid,	1
nameless	1
impulse,	1
in	1
a	1
superb	1
lofty	1
arch	1
the	1
bright	1
steel	1
spans	1
the	1
foaming	1
distance,	1
and	1
quivers	1
in	1
the	1
life	1
spot	1
of	1
the	1
whale.	1
Instead	1
of	1
sparkling	1
water,	1
he	1
now	1
spouts	1
red	1
blood.	1
"That	1
drove	1
the	1
spigot	1
out	1
of	1
him!"	1
cried	1
Stubb.	1
"'Tis	1
July's	1
immortal	1
Fourth;	1
all	1
fountains	1
must	1
run	1
wine	1
today!	1
Would	1
now,	1
it	1
were	1
old	1
Orleans	1
whiskey,	1
or	1
old	1
Ohio,	1
or	1
unspeakable	1
old	1
Monongahela!	1
Then,	1
Tashtego,	1
lad,	1
I'd	1
have	1
ye	1
hold	1
a	1
canakin	1
to	1
the	1
jet,	1
and	1
we'd	1
drink	1
round	1
it!	1
Yea,	1
verily,	1
hearts	1
alive,	1
we'd	1
brew	1
choice	1
punch	1
in	1
the	1
spread	1
of	1
his	1
spout-hole	1
there,	1
and	1
from	1
that	1
live	1
punch-bowl	1
quaff	1
the	1
living	1
stuff."	1
Again	1
and	1
again	1
to	1
such	1
gamesome	1
talk,	1
the	1
dexterous	1
dart	1
is	1
repeated,	1
the	1
spear	1
returning	1
to	1
its	1
master	1
like	1
a	1
greyhound	1
held	1
in	1
skilful	1
leash.	1
The	1
agonized	1
whale	1
goes	1
into	1
his	1
flurry;	1
the	1
tow-line	1
is	1
slackened,	1
and	1
the	1
pitchpoler	1
dropping	1
astern,	1
folds	1
his	1
hands,	1
and	1
mutely	1
watches	1
the	1
monster	1
die.	1
CHAPTER	1
85	1
The	1
Fountain.	1
That	1
for	1
six	1
thousand	1
years--and	1
no	1
one	1
knows	1
how	1
many	1
millions	1
of	1
ages	1
before--the	1
great	1
whales	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
spouting	1
all	1
over	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
sprinkling	1
and	1
mistifying	1
the	1
gardens	1
of	1
the	1
deep,	1
as	1
with	1
so	1
many	1
sprinkling	1
or	1
mistifying	1
pots;	1
and	1
that	1
for	1
some	1
centuries	1
back,	1
thousands	1
of	1
hunters	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
close	1
by	1
the	1
fountain	1
of	1
the	1
whale,	1
watching	1
these	1
sprinklings	1
and	1
spoutings--that	1
all	1
this	1
should	1
be,	1
and	1
yet,	1
that	1
down	1
to	1
this	1
blessed	1
minute	1
(fifteen	1
and	1
a	1
quarter	1
minutes	1
past	1
one	1
o'clock	1
P.M.	1
of	1
this	1
sixteenth	1
day	1
of	1
December,	1
A.D.	1
1851),	1
it	1
should	1
still	1
remain	1
a	1
problem,	1
whether	1
these	1
spoutings	1
are,	1
after	1
all,	1
really	1
water,	1
or	1
nothing	1
but	1
vapour--this	1
is	1
surely	1
a	1
noteworthy	1
thing.	1
Let	1
us,	1
then,	1
look	1
at	1
this	1
matter,	1
along	1
with	1
some	1
interesting	1
items	1
contingent.	1
Every	1
one	1
knows	1
that	1
by	1
the	1
peculiar	1
cunning	1
of	1
their	1
gills,	1
the	1
finny	1
tribes	1
in	1
general	1
breathe	1
the	1
air	1
which	1
at	1
all	1
times	1
is	1
combined	1
with	1
the	1
element	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
swim;	1
hence,	1
a	1
herring	1
or	1
a	1
cod	1
might	1
live	1
a	1
century,	1
and	1
never	1
once	1
raise	1
its	1
head	1
above	1
the	1
surface.	1
But	1
owing	1
to	1
his	1
marked	1
internal	1
structure	1
which	1
gives	1
him	1
regular	1
lungs,	1
like	1
a	1
human	1
being's,	1
the	1
whale	1
can	1
only	1
live	1
by	1
inhaling	1
the	1
disengaged	1
air	1
in	1
the	1
open	1
atmosphere.	1
Wherefore	1
the	1
necessity	1
for	1
his	1
periodical	1
visits	1
to	1
the	1
upper	1
world.	1
But	1
he	1
cannot	1
in	1
any	1
degree	1
breathe	1
through	1
his	1
mouth,	1
for,	1
in	1
his	1
ordinary	1
attitude,	1
the	1
Sperm	1
Whale's	1
mouth	1
is	1
buried	1
at	1
least	1
eight	1
feet	1
beneath	1
the	1
surface;	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
still	1
more,	1
his	1
windpipe	1
has	1
no	1
connexion	1
with	1
his	1
mouth.	1
No,	1
he	1
breathes	1
through	1
his	1
spiracle	1
alone;	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
his	1
head.	1
If	1
I	1
say,	1
that	1
in	1
any	1
creature	1
breathing	1
is	1
only	1
a	1
function	1
indispensable	1
to	1
vitality,	1
inasmuch	1
as	1
it	1
withdraws	1
from	1
the	1
air	1
a	1
certain	1
element,	1
which	1
being	1
subsequently	1
brought	1
into	1
contact	1
with	1
the	1
blood	1
imparts	1
to	1
the	1
blood	1
its	1
vivifying	1
principle,	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
I	1
shall	1
err;	1
though	1
I	1
may	1
possibly	1
use	1
some	1
superfluous	1
scientific	1
words.	1
Assume	1
it,	1
and	1
it	1
follows	1
that	1
if	1
all	1
the	1
blood	1
in	1
a	1
man	1
could	1
be	1
aerated	1
with	1
one	1
breath,	1
he	1
might	1
then	1
seal	1
up	1
his	1
nostrils	1
and	1
not	1
fetch	1
another	1
for	1
a	1
considerable	1
time.	1
That	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
he	1
would	1
then	1
live	1
without	1
breathing.	1
Anomalous	1
as	1
it	1
may	1
seem,	1
this	1
is	1
precisely	1
the	1
case	1
with	1
the	1
whale,	1
who	1
systematically	1
lives,	1
by	1
intervals,	1
his	1
full	1
hour	1
and	1
more	1
(when	1
at	1
the	1
bottom)	1
without	1
drawing	1
a	1
single	1
breath,	1
or	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
in	1
any	1
way	1
inhaling	1
a	1
particle	1
of	1
air;	1
for,	1
remember,	1
he	1
has	1
no	1
gills.	1
How	1
is	1
this?	1
Between	1
his	1
ribs	1
and	1
on	1
each	1
side	1
of	1
his	1
spine	1
he	1
is	1
supplied	1
with	1
a	1
remarkable	1
involved	1
Cretan	1
labyrinth	1
of	1
vermicelli-like	1
vessels,	1
which	1
vessels,	1
when	1
he	1
quits	1
the	1
surface,	1
are	1
completely	1
distended	1
with	1
oxygenated	1
blood.	1
So	1
that	1
for	1
an	1
hour	1
or	1
more,	1
a	1
thousand	1
fathoms	1
in	1
the	1
sea,	1
he	1
carries	1
a	1
surplus	1
stock	1
of	1
vitality	1
in	1
him,	1
just	1
as	1
the	1
camel	1
crossing	1
the	1
waterless	1
desert	1
carries	1
a	1
surplus	1
supply	1
of	1
drink	1
for	1
future	1
use	1
in	1
its	1
four	1
supplementary	1
stomachs.	1
The	1
anatomical	1
fact	1
of	1
this	1
labyrinth	1
is	1
indisputable;	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
supposition	1
founded	1
upon	1
it	1
is	1
reasonable	1
and	1
true,	1
seems	1
the	1
more	1
cogent	1
to	1
me,	1
when	1
I	1
consider	1
the	1
otherwise	1
inexplicable	1
obstinacy	1
of	1
that	1
leviathan	1
in	1
HAVING	1
HIS	1
SPOUTINGS	1
OUT,	1
as	1
the	1
fishermen	1
phrase	1
it.	1
This	1
is	1
what	1
I	1
mean.	1
If	1
unmolested,	1
upon	1
rising	1
to	1
the	1
surface,	1
the	1
Sperm	1
Whale	1
will	1
continue	1
there	1
for	1
a	1
period	1
of	1
time	1
exactly	1
uniform	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
other	1
unmolested	1
risings.	1
Say	1
he	1
stays	1
eleven	1
minutes,	1
and	1
jets	1
seventy	1
times,	1
that	1
is,	1
respires	1
seventy	1
breaths;	1
then	1
whenever	1
he	1
rises	1
again,	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
sure	1
to	1
have	1
his	1
seventy	1
breaths	1
over	1
again,	1
to	1
a	1
minute.	1
Now,	1
if	1
after	1
he	1
fetches	1
a	1
few	1
breaths	1
you	1
alarm	1
him,	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
sounds,	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
always	1
dodging	1
up	1
again	1
to	1
make	1
good	1
his	1
regular	1
allowance	1
of	1
air.	1
And	1
not	1
till	1
those	1
seventy	1
breaths	1
are	1
told,	1
will	1
he	1
finally	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
stay	1
out	1
his	1
full	1
term	1
below.	1
Remark,	1
however,	1
that	1
in	1
different	1
individuals	1
these	1
rates	1
are	1
different;	1
but	1
in	1
any	1
one	1
they	1
are	1
alike.	1
Now,	1
why	1
should	1
the	1
whale	1
thus	1
insist	1
upon	1
having	1
his	1
spoutings	1
out,	1
unless	1
it	1
be	1
to	1
replenish	1
his	1
reservoir	1
of	1
air,	1
ere	1
descending	1
for	1
good?	1
How	1
obvious	1
is	1
it,	1
too,	1
that	1
this	1
necessity	1
for	1
the	1
whale's	1
rising	1
exposes	1
him	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
fatal	1
hazards	1
of	1
the	1
chase.	1
For	1
not	1
by	1
hook	1
or	1
by	1
net	1
could	1
this	1
vast	1
leviathan	1
be	1
caught,	1
when	1
sailing	1
a	1
thousand	1
fathoms	1
beneath	1
the	1
sunlight.	1
Not	1
so	1
much	1
thy	1
skill,	1
then,	1
O	1
hunter,	1
as	1
the	1
great	1
necessities	1
that	1
strike	1
the	1
victory	1
to	1
thee!	1
In	1
man,	1
breathing	1
is	1
incessantly	1
going	1
on--one	1
breath	1
only	1
serving	1
for	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
pulsations;	1
so	1
that	1
whatever	1
other	1
business	1
he	1
has	1
to	1
attend	1
to,	1
waking	1
or	1
sleeping,	1
breathe	1
he	1
must,	1
or	1
die	1
he	1
will.	1
But	1
the	1
Sperm	1
Whale	1
only	1
breathes	1
about	1
one	1
seventh	1
or	1
Sunday	1
of	1
his	1
time.	1
It	1
has	1
been	1
said	1
that	1
the	1
whale	1
only	1
breathes	1
through	1
his	1
spout-hole;	1
if	1
it	1
could	1
truthfully	1
be	1
added	1
that	1
his	1
spouts	1
are	1
mixed	1
with	1
water,	1
then	1
I	1
opine	1
we	1
should	1
be	1
furnished	1
with	1
the	1
reason	1
why	1
his	1
sense	1
of	1
smell	1
seems	1
obliterated	1
in	1
him;	1
for	1
the	1
only	1
thing	1
about	1
him	1
that	1
at	1
all	1
answers	1
to	1
his	1
nose	1
is	1
that	1
identical	1
spout-hole;	1
and	1
being	1
so	1
clogged	1
with	1
two	1
elements,	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
expected	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
smelling.	1
But	1
owing	1
to	1
the	1
mystery	1
of	1
the	1
spout--whether	1
it	1
be	1
water	1
or	1
whether	1
it	1
be	1
vapour--no	1
absolute	1
certainty	1
can	1
as	1
yet	1
be	1
arrived	1
at	1
on	1
this	1
head.	1
Sure	1
it	1
is,	1
nevertheless,	1
that	1
the	1
Sperm	1
Whale	1
has	1
no	1
proper	1
olfactories.	1
But	1
what	1
does	1
he	1
want	1
of	1
them?	1
No	1
roses,	1
no	1
violets,	1
no	1
Cologne-water	1
in	1
the	1
sea.	1
Furthermore,	1
as	1
his	1
windpipe	1
solely	1
opens	1
into	1
the	1
tube	1
of	1
his	1
spouting	1
canal,	1
and	1
as	1
that	1
long	1
canal--like	1
the	1
grand	1
Erie	1
Canal--is	1
furnished	1
with	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
locks	1
(that	1
open	1
and	1
shut)	1
for	1
the	1
downward	1
retention	1
of	1
air	1
or	1
the	1
upward	1
exclusion	1
of	1
water,	1
therefore	1
the	1
whale	1
has	1
no	1
voice;	1
unless	1
you	1
insult	1
him	1
by	1
saying,	1
that	1
when	1
he	1
so	1
strangely	1
rumbles,	1
he	1
talks	1
through	1
his	1
nose.	1
But	1
then	1
again,	1
what	1
has	1
the	1
whale	1
to	1
say?	1
Seldom	1
have	1
I	1
known	1
any	1
profound	1
being	1
that	1
had	1
anything	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
this	1
world,	1
unless	1
forced	1
to	1
stammer	1
out	1
something	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
getting	1
a	1
living.	1
Oh!	1
happy	1
that	1
the	1
world	1
is	1
such	1
an	1
excellent	1
listener!	1
Now,	1
the	1
spouting	1
canal	1
of	1
the	1
Sperm	1
Whale,	1
chiefly	1
intended	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
for	1
the	1
conveyance	1
of	1
air,	1
and	1
for	1
several	1
feet	1
laid	1
along,	1
horizontally,	1
just	1
beneath	1
the	1
upper	1
surface	1
of	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
a	1
little	1
to	1
one	1
side;	1
this	1
curious	1
canal	1
is	1
very	1
much	1
like	1
a	1
gas-pipe	1
laid	1
down	1
in	1
a	1
city	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
a	1
street.	1
But	1
the	1
question	1
returns	1
whether	1
this	1
gas-pipe	1
is	1
also	1
a	1
water-pipe;	1
in	1
other	1
words,	1
whether	1
the	1
spout	1
of	1
the	1
Sperm	1
Whale	1
is	1
the	1
mere	1
vapour	1
of	1
the	1
exhaled	1
breath,	1
or	1
whether	1
that	1
exhaled	1
breath	1
is	1
mixed	1
with	1
water	1
taken	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
mouth,	1
and	1
discharged	1
through	1
the	1
spiracle.	1
It	1
is	1
certain	1
that	1
the	1
mouth	1
indirectly	1
communicates	1
with	1
the	1
spouting	1
canal;	1
but	1
it	1
cannot	1
be	1
proved	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
for	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
discharging	1
water	1
through	1
the	1
spiracle.	1
Because	1
the	1
greatest	1
necessity	1
for	1
so	1
doing	1
would	1
seem	1
to	1
be,	1
when	1
in	1
feeding	1
he	1
accidentally	1
takes	1
in	1
water.	1
But	1
the	1
Sperm	1
Whale's	1
food	1
is	1
far	1
beneath	1
the	1
surface,	1
and	1
there	1
he	1
cannot	1
spout	1
even	1
if	1
he	1
would.	1
Besides,	1
if	1
you	1
regard	1
him	1
very	1
closely,	1
and	1
time	1
him	1
with	1
your	1
watch,	1
you	1
will	1
find	1
that	1
when	1
unmolested,	1
there	1
is	1
an	1
undeviating	1
rhyme	1
between	1
the	1
periods	1
of	1
his	1
jets	1
and	1
the	1
ordinary	1
periods	1
of	1
respiration.	1
But	1
why	1
pester	1
one	1
with	1
all	1
this	1
reasoning	1
on	1
the	1
subject?	1
Speak	1
out!	1
You	1
have	1
seen	1
him	1
spout;	1
then	1
declare	1
what	1
the	1
spout	1
is;	1
can	1
you	1
not	1
tell	1
water	1
from	1
air?	1
My	1
dear	1
sir,	1
in	1
this	1
world	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
so	1
easy	1
to	1
settle	1
these	1
plain	1
things.	1
I	1
have	1
ever	1
found	1
your	1
plain	1
things	1
the	1
knottiest	1
of	1
all.	1
And	1
as	1
for	1
this	1
whale	1
spout,	1
you	1
might	1
almost	1
stand	1
in	1
it,	1
and	1
yet	1
be	1
undecided	1
as	1
to	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
precisely.	1
The	1
central	1
body	1
of	1
it	1
is	1
hidden	1
in	1
the	1
snowy	1
sparkling	1
mist	1
enveloping	1
it;	1
and	1
how	1
can	1
you	1
certainly	1
tell	1
whether	1
any	1
water	1
falls	1
from	1
it,	1
when,	1
always,	1
when	1
you	1
are	1
close	1
enough	1
to	1
a	1
whale	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
close	1
view	1
of	1
his	1
spout,	1
he	1
is	1
in	1
a	1
prodigious	1
commotion,	1
the	1
water	1
cascading	1
all	1
around	1
him.	1
And	1
if	1
at	1
such	1
times	1
you	1
should	1
think	1
that	1
you	1
really	1
perceived	1
drops	1
of	1
moisture	1
in	1
the	1
spout,	1
how	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
merely	1
condensed	1
from	1
its	1
vapour;	1
or	1
how	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
those	1
identical	1
drops	1
superficially	1
lodged	1
in	1
the	1
spout-hole	1
fissure,	1
which	1
is	1
countersunk	1
into	1
the	1
summit	1
of	1
the	1
whale's	1
head?	1
For	1
even	1
when	1
tranquilly	1
swimming	1
through	1
the	1
mid-day	1
sea	1
in	1
a	1
calm,	1
with	1
his	1
elevated	1
hump	1
sun-dried	1
as	1
a	1
dromedary's	1
in	1
the	1
desert;	1
even	1
then,	1
the	1
whale	1
always	1
carries	1
a	1
small	1
basin	1
of	1
water	1
on	1
his	1
head,	1
as	1
under	1
a	1
blazing	1
sun	1
you	1
will	1
sometimes	1
see	1
a	1
cavity	1
in	1
a	1
rock	1
filled	1
up	1
with	1
rain.	1
Nor	1
is	1
it	1
at	1
all	1
prudent	1
for	1
the	1
hunter	1
to	1
be	1
over	1
curious	1
touching	1
the	1
precise	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
whale	1
spout.	1
It	1
will	1
not	1
do	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
peering	1
into	1
it,	1
and	1
putting	1
his	1
face	1
in	1
it.	1
You	1
cannot	1
go	1
with	1
your	1
pitcher	1
to	1
this	1
fountain	1
and	1
fill	1
it,	1
and	1
bring	1
it	1
away.	1
For	1
even	1
when	1
coming	1
into	1
slight	1
contact	1
with	1
the	1
outer,	1
vapoury	1
shreds	1
of	1
the	1
jet,	1
which	1
will	1
often	1
happen,	1
your	1
skin	1
will	1
feverishly	1
smart,	1
from	1
the	1
acridness	1
of	1
the	1
thing	1
so	1
touching	1
it.	1
And	1
I	1
know	1
one,	1
who	1
coming	1
into	1
still	1
closer	1
contact	1
with	1
the	1
spout,	1
whether	1
with	1
some	1
scientific	1
object	1
in	1
view,	1
or	1
otherwise,	1
I	1
cannot	1
say,	1
the	1
skin	1
peeled	1
off	1
from	1
his	1
cheek	1
and	1
arm.	1
Wherefore,	1
among	1
whalemen,	1
the	1
spout	1
is	1
deemed	1
poisonous;	1
they	1
try	1
to	1
evade	1
it.	1
Another	1
thing;	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
it	1
said,	1
and	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
much	1
doubt	1
it,	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
jet	1
is	1
fairly	1
spouted	1
into	1
your	1
eyes,	1
it	1
will	1
blind	1
you.	1
The	1
wisest	1
thing	1
the	1
investigator	1
can	1
do	1
then,	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
me,	1
is	1
to	1
let	1
this	1
deadly	1
spout	1
alone.	1
Still,	1
we	1
can	1
hypothesize,	1
even	1
if	1
we	1
cannot	1
prove	1
and	1
establish.	1
My	1
hypothesis	1
is	1
this:	1
that	1
the	1
spout	1
is	1
nothing	1
but	1
mist.	1
And	1
besides	1
other	1
reasons,	1
to	1
this	1
conclusion	1
I	1
am	1
impelled,	1
by	1
considerations	1
touching	1
the	1
great	1
inherent	1
dignity	1
and	1
sublimity	1
of	1
the	1
Sperm	1
Whale;	1
I	1
account	1
him	1
no	1
common,	1
shallow	1
being,	1
inasmuch	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
an	1
undisputed	1
fact	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
never	1
found	1
on	1
soundings,	1
or	1
near	1
shores;	1
all	1
other	1
whales	1
sometimes	1
are.	1
He	1
is	1
both	1
ponderous	1
and	1
profound.	1
And	1
I	1
am	1
convinced	1
that	1
from	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
all	1
ponderous	1
profound	1
beings,	1
such	1
as	1
Plato,	1
Pyrrho,	1
the	1
Devil,	1
Jupiter,	1
Dante,	1
and	1
so	1
on,	1
there	1
always	1
goes	1
up	1
a	1
certain	1
semi-visible	1
steam,	1
while	1
in	1
the	1
act	1
of	1
thinking	1
deep	1
thoughts.	1
While	1
composing	1
a	1
little	1
treatise	1
on	1
Eternity,	1
I	1
had	1
the	1
curiosity	1
to	1
place	1
a	1
mirror	1
before	1
me;	1
and	1
ere	1
long	1
saw	1
reflected	1
there,	1
a	1
curious	1
involved	1
worming	1
and	1
undulation	1
in	1
the	1
atmosphere	1
over	1
my	1
head.	1
The	1
invariable	1
moisture	1
of	1
my	1
hair,	1
while	1
plunged	1
in	1
deep	1
thought,	1
after	1
six	1
cups	1
of	1
hot	1
tea	1
in	1
my	1
thin	1
shingled	1
attic,	1
of	1
an	1
August	1
noon;	1
this	1
seems	1
an	1
additional	1
argument	1
for	1
the	1
above	1
supposition.	1
And	1
how	1
nobly	1
it	1
raises	1
our	1
conceit	1
of	1
the	1
mighty,	1
misty	1
monster,	1
to	1
behold	1
him	1
solemnly	1
sailing	1
through	1
a	1
calm	1
tropical	1
sea;	1
his	1
vast,	1
mild	1
head	1
overhung	1
by	1
a	1
canopy	1
of	1
vapour,	1
engendered	1
by	1
his	1
incommunicable	1
contemplations,	1
and	1
that	1
vapour--as	1
you	1
will	1
sometimes	1
see	1
it--glorified	1
by	1
a	1
rainbow,	1
as	1
if	1
Heaven	1
itself	1
had	1
put	1
its	1
seal	1
upon	1
his	1
thoughts.	1
For,	1
d'ye	1
see,	1
rainbows	1
do	1
not	1
visit	1
the	1
clear	1
air;	1
they	1
only	1
irradiate	1
vapour.	1
And	1
so,	1
through	1
all	1
the	1
thick	1
mists	1
of	1
the	1
dim	1
doubts	1
in	1
my	1
mind,	1
divine	1
intuitions	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
shoot,	1
enkindling	1
my	1
fog	1
with	1
a	1
heavenly	1
ray.	1
And	1
for	1
this	1
I	1
thank	1
God;	1
for	1
all	1
have	1
doubts;	1
many	1
deny;	1
but	1
doubts	1
or	1
denials,	1
few	1
along	1
with	1
them,	1
have	1
intuitions.	1
Doubts	1
of	1
all	1
things	1
earthly,	1
and	1
intuitions	1
of	1
some	1
things	1
heavenly;	1
this	1
combination	1
makes	1
neither	1
believer	1
nor	1
infidel,	1
but	1
makes	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
regards	1
them	1
both	1
with	1
equal	1
eye.	1
CHAPTER	1
86	1
The	1
Tail.	1
Other	1
poets	1
have	1
warbled	1
the	1
praises	1
of	1
the	1
soft	1
eye	1
of	1
the	1
antelope,	1
and	1
the	1
lovely	1
plumage	1
of	1
the	1
bird	1
that	1
never	1
alights;	1
less	1
celestial,	1
I	1
celebrate	1
a	1
tail.	1
Reckoning	1
the	1
largest	1
sized	1
Sperm	1
Whale's	1
tail	1
to	1
begin	1
at	1
that	1
point	1
of	1
the	1
trunk	1
where	1
it	1
tapers	1
to	1
about	1
the	1
girth	1
of	1
a	1
man,	1
it	1
comprises	1
upon	1
its	1
upper	1
surface	1
alone,	1
an	1
area	1
of	1
at	1
least	1
fifty	1
square	1
feet.	1
The	1
compact	1
round	1
body	1
of	1
its	1
root	1
expands	1
into	1
two	1
broad,	1
firm,	1
flat	1
palms	1
or	1
flukes,	1
gradually	1
shoaling	1
away	1
to	1
less	1
than	1
an	1
inch	1
in	1
thickness.	1
At	1
the	1
crotch	1
or	1
junction,	1
these	1
flukes	1
slightly	1
overlap,	1
then	1
sideways	1
recede	1
from	1
each	1
other	1
like	1
wings,	1
leaving	1
a	1
wide	1
vacancy	1
between.	1
In	1
no	1
living	1
thing	1
are	1
the	1
lines	1
of	1
beauty	1
more	1
exquisitely	1
defined	1
than	1
in	1
the	1
crescentic	1
borders	1
of	1
these	1
flukes.	1
At	1
its	1
utmost	1
expansion	1
in	1
the	1
full	1
grown	1
whale,	1
the	1
tail	1
will	1
considerably	1
exceed	1
twenty	1
feet	1
across.	1
The	1
entire	1
member	1
seems	1
a	1
dense	1
webbed	1
bed	1
of	1
welded	1
sinews;	1
but	1
cut	1
into	1
it,	1
and	1
you	1
find	1
that	1
three	1
distinct	1
strata	1
compose	1
it:--upper,	1
middle,	1
and	1
lower.	1
The	1
fibres	1
in	1
the	1
upper	1
and	1
lower	1
layers,	1
are	1
long	1
and	1
horizontal;	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
middle	1
one,	1
very	1
short,	1
and	1
running	1
crosswise	1
between	1
the	1
outside	1
layers.	1
This	1
triune	1
structure,	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
anything	1
else,	1
imparts	1
power	1
to	1
the	1
tail.	1
To	1
the	1
student	1
of	1
old	1
Roman	1
walls,	1
the	1
middle	1
layer	1
will	1
furnish	1
a	1
curious	1
parallel	1
to	1
the	1
thin	1
course	1
of	1
tiles	1
always	1
alternating	1
with	1
the	1
stone	1
in	1
those	1
wonderful	1
relics	1
of	1
the	1
antique,	1
and	1
which	1
undoubtedly	1
contribute	1
so	1
much	1
to	1
the	1
great	1
strength	1
of	1
the	1
masonry.	1
But	1
as	1
if	1
this	1
vast	1
local	1
power	1
in	1
the	1
tendinous	1
tail	1
were	1
not	1
enough,	1
the	1
whole	1
bulk	1
of	1
the	1
leviathan	1
is	1
knit	1
over	1
with	1
a	1
warp	1
and	1
woof	1
of	1
muscular	1
fibres	1
and	1
filaments,	1
which	1
passing	1
on	1
either	1
side	1
the	1
loins	1
and	1
running	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
flukes,	1
insensibly	1
blend	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
largely	1
contribute	1
to	1
their	1
might;	1
so	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
tail	1
the	1
confluent	1
measureless	1
force	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
whale	1
seems	1
concentrated	1
to	1
a	1
point.	1
Could	1
annihilation	1
occur	1
to	1
matter,	1
this	1
were	1
the	1
thing	1
to	1
do	1
it.	1
Nor	1
does	1
this--its	1
amazing	1
strength,	1
at	1
all	1
tend	1
to	1
cripple	1
the	1
graceful	1
flexion	1
of	1
its	1
motions;	1
where	1
infantileness	1
of	1
ease	1
undulates	1
through	1
a	1
Titanism	1
of	1
power.	1
On	1
the	1
contrary,	1
those	1
motions	1
derive	1
their	1
most	1
appalling	1
beauty	1
from	1
it.	1
Real	1
strength	1
never	1
impairs	1
beauty	1
or	1
harmony,	1
but	1
it	1
often	1
bestows	1
it;	1
and	1
in	1
everything	1
imposingly	1
beautiful,	1
strength	1
has	1
much	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
the	1
magic.	1
Take	1
away	1
the	1
tied	1
tendons	1
that	1
all	1
over	1
seem	1
bursting	1
from	1
the	1
marble	1
in	1
the	1
carved	1
Hercules,	1
and	1
its	1
charm	1
would	1
be	1
gone.	1
As	1
devout	1
Eckerman	1
lifted	1
the	1
linen	1
sheet	1
from	1
the	1
naked	1
corpse	1
of	1
Goethe,	1
he	1
was	1
overwhelmed	1
with	1
the	1
massive	1
chest	1
of	1
the	1
man,	1
that	1
seemed	1
as	1
a	1
Roman	1
triumphal	1
arch.	1
When	1
Angelo	1
paints	1
even	1
God	1
the	1
Father	1
in	1
human	1
form,	1
mark	1
what	1
robustness	1
is	1
there.	1
And	1
whatever	1
they	1
may	1
reveal	1
of	1
the	1
divine	1
love	1
in	1
the	1
Son,	1
the	1
soft,	1
curled,	1
hermaphroditical	1
Italian	1
pictures,	1
in	1
which	1
his	1
idea	1
has	1
been	1
most	1
successfully	1
embodied;	1
these	1
pictures,	1
so	1
destitute	1
as	1
they	1
are	1
of	1
all	1
brawniness,	1
hint	1
nothing	1
of	1
any	1
power,	1
but	1
the	1
mere	1
negative,	1
feminine	1
one	1
of	1
submission	1
and	1
endurance,	1
which	1
on	1
all	1
hands	1
it	1
is	1
conceded,	1
form	1
the	1
peculiar	1
practical	1
virtues	1
of	1
his	1
teachings.	1
Such	1
is	1
the	1
subtle	1
elasticity	1
of	1
the	1
organ	1
I	1
treat	1
of,	1
that	1
whether	1
wielded	1
in	1
sport,	1
or	1
in	1
earnest,	1
or	1
in	1
anger,	1
whatever	1
be	1
the	1
mood	1
it	1
be	1
in,	1
its	1
flexions	1
are	1
invariably	1
marked	1
by	1
exceeding	1
grace.	1
Therein	1
no	1
fairy's	1
arm	1
can	1
transcend	1
it.	1
Five	1
great	1
motions	1
are	1
peculiar	1
to	1
it.	1
First,	1
when	1
used	1
as	1
a	1
fin	1
for	1
progression;	1
Second,	1
when	1
used	1
as	1
a	1
mace	1
in	1
battle;	1
Third,	1
in	1
sweeping;	1
Fourth,	1
in	1
lobtailing;	1
Fifth,	1
in	1
peaking	1
flukes.	1
First:	1
Being	1
horizontal	1
in	1
its	1
position,	1
the	1
Leviathan's	1
tail	1
acts	1
in	1
a	1
different	1
manner	1
from	1
the	1
tails	1
of	1
all	1
other	1
sea	1
creatures.	1
It	1
never	1
wriggles.	1
In	1
man	1
or	1
fish,	1
wriggling	1
is	1
a	1
sign	1
of	1
inferiority.	1
To	1
the	1
whale,	1
his	1
tail	1
is	1
the	1
sole	1
means	1
of	1
propulsion.	1
Scroll-wise	1
coiled	1
forwards	1
beneath	1
the	1
body,	1
and	1
then	1
rapidly	1
sprung	1
backwards,	1
it	1
is	1
this	1
which	1
gives	1
that	1
singular	1
darting,	1
leaping	1
motion	1
to	1
the	1
monster	1
when	1
furiously	1
swimming.	1
His	1
side-fins	1
only	1
serve	1
to	1
steer	1
by.	1
Second:	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
little	1
significant,	1
that	1
while	1
one	1
sperm	1
whale	1
only	1
fights	1
another	1
sperm	1
whale	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
jaw,	1
nevertheless,	1
in	1
his	1
conflicts	1
with	1
man,	1
he	1
chiefly	1
and	1
contemptuously	1
uses	1
his	1
tail.	1
In	1
striking	1
at	1
a	1
boat,	1
he	1
swiftly	1
curves	1
away	1
his	1
flukes	1
from	1
it,	1
and	1
the	1
blow	1
is	1
only	1
inflicted	1
by	1
the	1
recoil.	1
If	1
it	1
be	1
made	1
in	1
the	1
unobstructed	1
air,	1
especially	1
if	1
it	1
descend	1
to	1
its	1
mark,	1
the	1
stroke	1
is	1
then	1
simply	1
irresistible.	1
No	1
ribs	1
of	1
man	1
or	1
boat	1
can	1
withstand	1
it.	1
Your	1
only	1
salvation	1
lies	1
in	1
eluding	1
it;	1
but	1
if	1
it	1
comes	1
sideways	1
through	1
the	1
opposing	1
water,	1
then	1
partly	1
owing	1
to	1
the	1
light	1
buoyancy	1
of	1
the	1
whale	1
boat,	1
and	1
the	1
elasticity	1
of	1
its	1
materials,	1
a	1
cracked	1
rib	1
or	1
a	1
dashed	1
plank	1
or	1
two,	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
stitch	1
in	1
the	1
side,	1
is	1
generally	1
the	1
most	1
serious	1
result.	1
These	1
submerged	1
side	1
blows	1
are	1
so	1
often	1
received	1
in	1
the	1
fishery,	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
accounted	1
mere	1
child's	1
play.	1
Some	1
one	1
strips	1
off	1
a	1
frock,	1
and	1
the	1
hole	1
is	1
stopped.	1
Third:	1
I	1
cannot	1
demonstrate	1
it,	1
but	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
me,	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
whale	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
touch	1
is	1
concentrated	1
in	1
the	1
tail;	1
for	1
in	1
this	1
respect	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
delicacy	1
in	1
it	1
only	1
equalled	1
by	1
the	1
daintiness	1
of	1
the	1
elephant's	1
trunk.	1
This	1
delicacy	1
is	1
chiefly	1
evinced	1
in	1
the	1
action	1
of	1
sweeping,	1
when	1
in	1
maidenly	1
gentleness	1
the	1
whale	1
with	1
a	1
certain	1
soft	1
slowness	1
moves	1
his	1
immense	1
flukes	1
from	1
side	1
to	1
side	1
upon	1
the	1
surface	1
of	1
the	1
sea;	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
feel	1
but	1
a	1
sailor's	1
whisker,	1
woe	1
to	1
that	1
sailor,	1
whiskers	1
and	1
all.	1
What	1
tenderness	1
there	1
is	1
in	1
that	1
preliminary	1
touch!	1
Had	1
this	1
tail	1
any	1
prehensile	1
power,	1
I	1
should	1
straightway	1
bethink	1
me	1
of	1
Darmonodes'	1
elephant	1
that	1
so	1
frequented	1
the	1
flower-market,	1
and	1
with	1
low	1
salutations	1
presented	1
nosegays	1
to	1
damsels,	1
and	1
then	1
caressed	1
their	1
zones.	1
On	1
more	1
accounts	1
than	1
one,	1
a	1
pity	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
the	1
whale	1
does	1
not	1
possess	1
this	1
prehensile	1
virtue	1
in	1
his	1
tail;	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
yet	1
another	1
elephant,	1
that	1
when	1
wounded	1
in	1
the	1
fight,	1
curved	1
round	1
his	1
trunk	1
and	1
extracted	1
the	1
dart.	1
Fourth:	1
Stealing	1
unawares	1
upon	1
the	1
whale	1
in	1
the	1
fancied	1
security	1
of	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
solitary	1
seas,	1
you	1
find	1
him	1
unbent	1
from	1
the	1
vast	1
corpulence	1
of	1
his	1
dignity,	1
and	1
kitten-like,	1
he	1
plays	1
on	1
the	1
ocean	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
hearth.	1
But	1
still	1
you	1
see	1
his	1
power	1
in	1
his	1
play.	1
The	1
broad	1
palms	1
of	1
his	1
tail	1
are	1
flirted	1
high	1
into	1
the	1
air;	1
then	1
smiting	1
the	1
surface,	1
the	1
thunderous	1
concussion	1
resounds	1
for	1
miles.	1
You	1
would	1
almost	1
think	1
a	1
great	1
gun	1
had	1
been	1
discharged;	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
noticed	1
the	1
light	1
wreath	1
of	1
vapour	1
from	1
the	1
spiracle	1
at	1
his	1
other	1
extremity,	1
you	1
would	1
think	1
that	1
that	1
was	1
the	1
smoke	1
from	1
the	1
touch-hole.	1
Fifth:	1
As	1
in	1
the	1
ordinary	1
floating	1
posture	1
of	1
the	1
leviathan	1
the	1
flukes	1
lie	1
considerably	1
below	1
the	1
level	1
of	1
his	1
back,	1
they	1
are	1
then	1
completely	1
out	1
of	1
sight	1
beneath	1
the	1
surface;	1
but	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
about	1
to	1
plunge	1
into	1
the	1
deeps,	1
his	1
entire	1
flukes	1
with	1
at	1
least	1
thirty	1
feet	1
of	1
his	1
body	1
are	1
tossed	1
erect	1
in	1
the	1
air,	1
and	1
so	1
remain	1
vibrating	1
a	1
moment,	1
till	1
they	1
downwards	1
shoot	1
out	1
of	1
view.	1
Excepting	1
the	1
sublime	1
BREACH--somewhere	1
else	1
to	1
be	1
described--this	1
peaking	1
of	1
the	1
whale's	1
flukes	1
is	1
perhaps	1
the	1
grandest	1
sight	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
in	1
all	1
animated	1
nature.	1
Out	1
of	1
the	1
bottomless	1
profundities	1
the	1
gigantic	1
tail	1
seems	1
spasmodically	1
snatching	1
at	1
the	1
highest	1
heaven.	1
So	1
in	1
dreams,	1
have	1
I	1
seen	1
majestic	1
Satan	1
thrusting	1
forth	1
his	1
tormented	1
colossal	1
claw	1
from	1
the	1
flame	1
Baltic	1
of	1
Hell.	1
But	1
in	1
gazing	1
at	1
such	1
scenes,	1
it	1
is	1
all	1
in	1
all	1
what	1
mood	1
you	1
are	1
in;	1
if	1
in	1
the	1
Dantean,	1
the	1
devils	1
will	1
occur	1
to	1
you;	1
if	1
in	1
that	1
of	1
Isaiah,	1
the	1
archangels.	1
Standing	1
at	1
the	1
mast-head	1
of	1
my	1
ship	1
during	1
a	1
sunrise	1
that	1
crimsoned	1
sky	1
and	1
sea,	1
I	1
once	1
saw	1
a	1
large	1
herd	1
of	1
whales	1
in	1
the	1
east,	1
all	1
heading	1
towards	1
the	1
sun,	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
vibrating	1
in	1
concert	1
with	1
peaked	1
flukes.	1
As	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
at	1
the	1
time,	1
such	1
a	1
grand	1
embodiment	1
of	1
adoration	1
of	1
the	1
gods	1
was	1
never	1
beheld,	1
even	1
in	1
Persia,	1
the	1
home	1
of	1
the	1
fire	1
worshippers.	1
As	1
Ptolemy	1
Philopater	1
testified	1
of	1
the	1
African	1
elephant,	1
I	1
then	1
testified	1
of	1
the	1
whale,	1
pronouncing	1
him	1
the	1
most	1
devout	1
of	1
all	1
beings.	1
For	1
according	1
to	1
King	1
Juba,	1
the	1
military	1
elephants	1
of	1
antiquity	1
often	1
hailed	1
the	1
morning	1
with	1
their	1
trunks	1
uplifted	1
in	1
the	1
profoundest	1
silence.	1
The	1
chance	1
comparison	1
in	1
this	1
chapter,	1
between	1
the	1
whale	1
and	1
the	1
elephant,	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
some	1
aspects	1
of	1
the	1
tail	1
of	1
the	1
one	1
and	1
the	1
trunk	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
are	1
concerned,	1
should	1
not	1
tend	1
to	1
place	1
those	1
two	1
opposite	1
organs	1
on	1
an	1
equality,	1
much	1
less	1
the	1
creatures	1
to	1
which	1
they	1
respectively	1
belong.	1
For	1
as	1
the	1
mightiest	1
elephant	1
is	1
but	1
a	1
terrier	1
to	1
Leviathan,	1
so,	1
compared	1
with	1
Leviathan's	1
tail,	1
his	1
trunk	1
is	1
but	1
the	1
stalk	1
of	1
a	1
lily.	1
The	1
most	1
direful	1
blow	1
from	1
the	1
elephant's	1
trunk	1
were	1
as	1
the	1
playful	1
tap	1
of	1
a	1
fan,	1
compared	1
with	1
the	1
measureless	1
crush	1
and	1
crash	1
of	1
the	1
sperm	1
whale's	1
ponderous	1
flukes,	1
which	1
in	1
repeated	1
instances	1
have	1
one	1
after	1
the	1
other	1
hurled	1
entire	1
boats	1
with	1
all	1
their	1
oars	1
and	1
crews	1
into	1
the	1
air,	1
very	1
much	1
as	1
an	1
Indian	1
juggler	1
tosses	1
his	1
balls.*	1
*Though	1
all	1
comparison	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
general	1
bulk	1
between	1
the	1
whale	1
and	1
the	1
elephant	1
is	1
preposterous,	1
inasmuch	1
as	1
in	1
that	1
particular	1
the	1
elephant	1
stands	1
in	1
much	1
the	1
same	1
respect	1
to	1
the	1
whale	1
that	1
a	1
dog	1
does	1
to	1
the	1
elephant;	1
nevertheless,	1
there	1
are	1
not	1
wanting	1
some	1
points	1
of	1
curious	1
similitude;	1
among	1
these	1
is	1
the	1
spout.	1
It	1
is	1
well	1
known	1
that	1
the	1
elephant	1
will	1
often	1
draw	1
up	1
water	1
or	1
dust	1
in	1
his	1
trunk,	1
and	1
then	1
elevating	1
it,	1
jet	1
it	1
forth	1
in	1
a	1
stream.	1
The	1
more	1
I	1
consider	1
this	1
mighty	1
tail,	1
the	1
more	1
do	1
I	1
deplore	1
my	1
inability	1
to	1
express	1
it.	1
At	1
times	1
there	1
are	1
gestures	1
in	1
it,	1
which,	1
though	1
they	1
would	1
well	1
grace	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
man,	1
remain	1
wholly	1
inexplicable.	1
In	1
an	1
extensive	1
herd,	1
so	1
remarkable,	1
occasionally,	1
are	1
these	1
mystic	1
gestures,	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
hunters	1
who	1
have	1
declared	1
them	1
akin	1
to	1
Free-Mason	1
signs	1
and	1
symbols;	1
that	1
the	1
whale,	1
indeed,	1
by	1
these	1
methods	1
intelligently	1
conversed	1
with	1
the	1
world.	1
Nor	1
are	1
there	1
wanting	1
other	1
motions	1
of	1
the	1
whale	1
in	1
his	1
general	1
body,	1
full	1
of	1
strangeness,	1
and	1
unaccountable	1
to	1
his	1
most	1
experienced	1
assailant.	1
Dissect	1
him	1
how	1
I	1
may,	1
then,	1
I	1
but	1
go	1
skin	1
deep;	1
I	1
know	1
him	1
not,	1
and	1
never	1
will.	1
But	1
if	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
even	1
the	1
tail	1
of	1
this	1
whale,	1
how	1
understand	1
his	1
head?	1
much	1
more,	1
how	1
comprehend	1
his	1
face,	1
when	1
face	1
he	1
has	1
none?	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
see	1
my	1
back	1
parts,	1
my	1
tail,	1
he	1
seems	1
to	1
say,	1
but	1
my	1
face	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
seen.	1
But	1
I	1
cannot	1
completely	1
make	1
out	1
his	1
back	1
parts;	1
and	1
hint	1
what	1
he	1
will	1
about	1
his	1
face,	1
I	1
say	1
again	1
he	1
has	1
no	1
face.	1
CHAPTER	1
87	1
The	1
Grand	1
Armada.	1
The	1
long	1
and	1
narrow	1
peninsula	1
of	1
Malacca,	1
extending	1
south-eastward	1
from	1
the	1
territories	1
of	1
Birmah,	1
forms	1
the	1
most	1
southerly	1
point	1
of	1
all	1
Asia.	1
In	1
a	1
continuous	1
line	1
from	1
that	1
peninsula	1
stretch	1
the	1
long	1
islands	1
of	1
Sumatra,	1
Java,	1
Bally,	1
and	1
Timor;	1
which,	1
with	1
many	1
others,	1
form	1
a	1
vast	1
mole,	1
or	1
rampart,	1
lengthwise	1
connecting	1
Asia	1
with	1
Australia,	1
and	1
dividing	1
the	1
long	1
unbroken	1
Indian	1
ocean	1
from	1
the	1
thickly	1
studded	1
oriental	1
archipelagoes.	1
This	1
rampart	1
is	1
pierced	1
by	1
several	1
sally-ports	1
for	1
the	1
convenience	1
of	1
ships	1
and	1
whales;	1
conspicuous	1
among	1
which	1
are	1
the	1
straits	1
of	1
Sunda	1
and	1
Malacca.	1
By	1
the	1
straits	1
of	1
Sunda,	1
chiefly,	1
vessels	1
bound	1
to	1
China	1
from	1
the	1
west,	1
emerge	1
into	1
the	1
China	1
seas.	1
Those	1
narrow	1
straits	1
of	1
Sunda	1
divide	1
Sumatra	1
from	1
Java;	1
and	1
standing	1
midway	1
in	1
that	1
vast	1
rampart	1
of	1
islands,	1
buttressed	1
by	1
that	1
bold	1
green	1
promontory,	1
known	1
to	1
seamen	1
as	1
Java	1
Head;	1
they	1
not	1
a	1
little	1
correspond	1
to	1
the	1
central	1
gateway	1
opening	1
into	1
some	1
vast	1
walled	1
empire:	1
and	1
considering	1
the	1
inexhaustible	1
wealth	1
of	1
spices,	1
and	1
silks,	1
and	1
jewels,	1
and	1
gold,	1
and	1
ivory,	1
with	1
which	1
the	1
thousand	1
islands	1
of	1
that	1
oriental	1
sea	1
are	1
enriched,	1
it	1
seems	1
a	1
significant	1
provision	1
of	1
nature,	1
that	1
such	1
treasures,	1
by	1
the	1
very	1
formation	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
should	1
at	1
least	1
bear	1
the	1
appearance,	1
however	1
ineffectual,	1
of	1
being	1
guarded	1
from	1
the	1
all-grasping	1
western	1
world.	1
The	1
shores	1
of	1
the	1
Straits	1
of	1
Sunda	1
are	1
unsupplied	1
with	1
those	1
domineering	1
fortresses	1
which	1
guard	1
the	1
entrances	1
to	1
the	1
Mediterranean,	1
the	1
Baltic,	1
and	1
the	1
Propontis.	1
Unlike	1
the	1
Danes,	1
these	1
Orientals	1
do	1
not	1
demand	1
the	1
obsequious	1
homage	1
of	1
lowered	1
top-sails	1
from	1
the	1
endless	1
procession	1
of	1
ships	1
before	1
the	1
wind,	1
which	1
for	1
centuries	1
past,	1
by	1
night	1
and	1
by	1
day,	1
have	1
passed	1
between	1
the	1
islands	1
of	1
Sumatra	1
and	1
Java,	1
freighted	1
with	1
the	1
costliest	1
cargoes	1
of	1
the	1
east.	1
But	1
while	1
they	1
freely	1
waive	1
a	1
ceremonial	1
like	1
this,	1
they	1
do	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
renounce	1
their	1
claim	1
to	1
more	1
solid	1
tribute.	1
Time	1
out	1
of	1
mind	1
the	1
piratical	1
proas	1
of	1
the	1
Malays,	1
lurking	1
among	1
the	1
low	1
shaded	1
coves	1
and	1
islets	1
of	1
Sumatra,	1
have	1
sallied	1
out	1
upon	1
the	1
vessels	1
sailing	1
through	1
the	1
straits,	1
fiercely	1
demanding	1
tribute	1
at	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
their	1
spears.	1
Though	1
by	1
the	1
repeated	1
bloody	1
chastisements	1
they	1
have	1
received	1
at	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
European	1
cruisers,	1
the	1
audacity	1
of	1
these	1
corsairs	1
has	1
of	1
late	1
been	1
somewhat	1
repressed;	1
yet,	1
even	1
at	1
the	1
present	1
day,	1
we	1
occasionally	1
hear	1
of	1
English	1
and	1
American	1
vessels,	1
which,	1
in	1
those	1
waters,	1
have	1
been	1
remorselessly	1
boarded	1
and	1
pillaged.	1
With	1
a	1
fair,	1
fresh	1
wind,	1
the	1
Pequod	1
was	1
now	1
drawing	1
nigh	1
to	1
these	1
straits;	1
Ahab	1
purposing	1
to	1
pass	1
through	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
Javan	1
sea,	1
and	1
thence,	1
cruising	1
northwards,	1
over	1
waters	1
known	1
to	1
be	1
frequented	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
by	1
the	1
Sperm	1
Whale,	1
sweep	1
inshore	1
by	1
the	1
Philippine	1
Islands,	1
and	1
gain	1
the	1
far	1
coast	1
of	1
Japan,	1
in	1
time	1
for	1
the	1
great	1
whaling	1
season	1
there.	1
By	1
these	1
means,	1
the	1
circumnavigating	1
Pequod	1
would	1
sweep	1
almost	1
all	1
the	1
known	1
Sperm	1
Whale	1
cruising	1
grounds	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
previous	1
to	1
descending	1
upon	1
the	1
Line	1
in	1
the	1
Pacific;	1
where	1
Ahab,	1
though	1
everywhere	1
else	1
foiled	1
in	1
his	1
pursuit,	1
firmly	1
counted	1
upon	1
giving	1
battle	1
to	1
Moby	1
Dick,	1
in	1
the	1
sea	1
he	1
was	1
most	1
known	1
to	1
frequent;	1
and	1
at	1
a	1
season	1
when	1
he	1
might	1
most	1
reasonably	1
be	1
presumed	1
to	1
be	1
haunting	1
it.	1
But	1
how	1
now?	1
in	1
this	1
zoned	1
quest,	1
does	1
Ahab	1
touch	1
no	1
land?	1
does	1
his	1
crew	1
drink	1
air?	1
Surely,	1
he	1
will	1
stop	1
for	1
water.	1
Nay.	1
For	1
a	1
long	1
time,	1
now,	1
the	1
circus-running	1
sun	1
has	1
raced	1
within	1
his	1
fiery	1
ring,	1
and	1
needs	1
no	1
sustenance	1
but	1
what's	1
in	1
himself.	1
So	1
Ahab.	1
Mark	1
this,	1
too,	1
in	1
the	1
whaler.	1
While	1
other	1
hulls	1
are	1
loaded	1
down	1
with	1
alien	1
stuff,	1
to	1
be	1
transferred	1
to	1
foreign	1
wharves;	1
the	1
world-wandering	1
whale-ship	1
carries	1
no	1
cargo	1
but	1
herself	1
and	1
crew,	1
their	1
weapons	1
and	1
their	1
wants.	1
She	1
has	1
a	1
whole	1
lake's	1
contents	1
bottled	1
in	1
her	1
ample	1
hold.	1
She	1
is	1
ballasted	1
with	1
utilities;	1
not	1
altogether	1
with	1
unusable	1
pig-lead	1
and	1
kentledge.	1
She	1
carries	1
years'	1
water	1
in	1
her.	1
Clear	1
old	1
prime	1
Nantucket	1
water;	1
which,	1
when	1
three	1
years	1
afloat,	1
the	1
Nantucketer,	1
in	1
the	1
Pacific,	1
prefers	1
to	1
drink	1
before	1
the	1
brackish	1
fluid,	1
but	1
yesterday	1
rafted	1
off	1
in	1
casks,	1
from	1
the	1
Peruvian	1
or	1
Indian	1
streams.	1
Hence	1
it	1
is,	1
that,	1
while	1
other	1
ships	1
may	1
have	1
gone	1
to	1
China	1
from	1
New	1
York,	1
and	1
back	1
again,	1
touching	1
at	1
a	1
score	1
of	1
ports,	1
the	1
whale-ship,	1
in	1
all	1
that	1
interval,	1
may	1
not	1
have	1
sighted	1
one	1
grain	1
of	1
soil;	1
her	1
crew	1
having	1
seen	1
no	1
man	1
but	1
floating	1
seamen	1
like	1
themselves.	1
So	1
that	1
did	1
you	1
carry	1
them	1
the	1
news	1
that	1
another	1
flood	1
had	1
come;	1
they	1
would	1
only	1
answer--"Well,	1
boys,	1
here's	1
the	1
ark!"	1
Now,	1
as	1
many	1
Sperm	1
Whales	1
had	1
been	1
captured	1
off	1
the	1
western	1
coast	1
of	1
Java,	1
in	1
the	1
near	1
vicinity	1
of	1
the	1
Straits	1
of	1
Sunda;	1
indeed,	1
as	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
ground,	1
roundabout,	1
was	1
generally	1
recognised	1
by	1
the	1
fishermen	1
as	1
an	1
excellent	1
spot	1
for	1
cruising;	1
therefore,	1
as	1
the	1
Pequod	1
gained	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
upon	1
Java	1
Head,	1
the	1
look-outs	1
were	1
repeatedly	1
hailed,	1
and	1
admonished	1
to	1
keep	1
wide	1
awake.	1
But	1
though	1
the	1
green	1
palmy	1
cliffs	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
soon	1
loomed	1
on	1
the	1
starboard	1
bow,	1
and	1
with	1
delighted	1
nostrils	1
the	1
fresh	1
cinnamon	1
was	1
snuffed	1
in	1
the	1
air,	1
yet	1
not	1
a	1
single	1
jet	1
was	1
descried.	1
Almost	1
renouncing	1
all	1
thought	1
of	1
falling	1
in	1
with	1
any	1
game	1
hereabouts,	1
the	1
ship	1
had	1
well	1
nigh	1
entered	1
the	1
straits,	1
when	1
the	1
customary	1
cheering	1
cry	1
was	1
heard	1
from	1
aloft,	1
and	1
ere	1
long	1
a	1
spectacle	1
of	1
singular	1
magnificence	1
saluted	1
us.	1
But	1
here	1
be	1
it	1
premised,	1
that	1
owing	1
to	1
the	1
unwearied	1
activity	1
with	1
which	1
of	1
late	1
they	1
have	1
been	1
hunted	1
over	1
all	1
four	1
oceans,	1
the	1
Sperm	1
Whales,	1
instead	1
of	1
almost	1
invariably	1
sailing	1
in	1
small	1
detached	1
companies,	1
as	1
in	1
former	1
times,	1
are	1
now	1
frequently	1
met	1
with	1
in	1
extensive	1
herds,	1
sometimes	1
embracing	1
so	1
great	1
a	1
multitude,	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
almost	1
seem	1
as	1
if	1
numerous	1
nations	1
of	1
them	1
had	1
sworn	1
solemn	1
league	1
and	1
covenant	1
for	1
mutual	1
assistance	1
and	1
protection.	1
To	1
this	1
aggregation	1
of	1
the	1
Sperm	1
Whale	1
into	1
such	1
immense	1
caravans,	1
may	1
be	1
imputed	1
the	1
circumstance	1
that	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
best	1
cruising	1
grounds,	1
you	1
may	1
now	1
sometimes	1
sail	1
for	1
weeks	1
and	1
months	1
together,	1
without	1
being	1
greeted	1
by	1
a	1
single	1
spout;	1
and	1
then	1
be	1
suddenly	1
saluted	1
by	1
what	1
sometimes	1
seems	1
thousands	1
on	1
thousands.	1
Broad	1
on	1
both	1
bows,	1
at	1
the	1
distance	1
of	1
some	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
miles,	1
and	1
forming	1
a	1
great	1
semicircle,	1
embracing	1
one	1
half	1
of	1
the	1
level	1
horizon,	1
a	1
continuous	1
chain	1
of	1
whale-jets	1
were	1
up-playing	1
and	1
sparkling	1
in	1
the	1
noon-day	1
air.	1
Unlike	1
the	1
straight	1
perpendicular	1
twin-jets	1
of	1
the	1
Right	1
Whale,	1
which,	1
dividing	1
at	1
top,	1
fall	1
over	1
in	1
two	1
branches,	1
like	1
the	1
cleft	1
drooping	1
boughs	1
of	1
a	1
willow,	1
the	1
single	1
forward-slanting	1
spout	1
of	1
the	1
Sperm	1
Whale	1
presents	1
a	1
thick	1
curled	1
bush	1
of	1
white	1
mist,	1
continually	1
rising	1
and	1
falling	1
away	1
to	1
leeward.	1
Seen	1
from	1
the	1
Pequod's	1
deck,	1
then,	1
as	1
she	1
would	1
rise	1
on	1
a	1
high	1
hill	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
this	1
host	1
of	1
vapoury	1
spouts,	1
individually	1
curling	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
air,	1
and	1
beheld	1
through	1
a	1
blending	1
atmosphere	1
of	1
bluish	1
haze,	1
showed	1
like	1
the	1
thousand	1
cheerful	1
chimneys	1
of	1
some	1
dense	1
metropolis,	1
descried	1
of	1
a	1
balmy	1
autumnal	1
morning,	1
by	1
some	1
horseman	1
on	1
a	1
height.	1
As	1
marching	1
armies	1
approaching	1
an	1
unfriendly	1
defile	1
in	1
the	1
mountains,	1
accelerate	1
their	1
march,	1
all	1
eagerness	1
to	1
place	1
that	1
perilous	1
passage	1
in	1
their	1
rear,	1
and	1
once	1
more	1
expand	1
in	1
comparative	1
security	1
upon	1
the	1
plain;	1
even	1
so	1
did	1
this	1
vast	1
fleet	1
of	1
whales	1
now	1
seem	1
hurrying	1
forward	1
through	1
the	1
straits;	1
gradually	1
contracting	1
the	1
wings	1
of	1
their	1
semicircle,	1
and	1
swimming	1
on,	1
in	1
one	1
solid,	1
but	1
still	1
crescentic	1
centre.	1
Crowding	1
all	1
sail	1
the	1
Pequod	1
pressed	1
after	1
them;	1
the	1
harpooneers	1
handling	1
their	1
weapons,	1
and	1
loudly	1
cheering	1
from	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
their	1
yet	1
suspended	1
boats.	1
If	1
the	1
wind	1
only	1
held,	1
little	1
doubt	1
had	1
they,	1
that	1
chased	1
through	1
these	1
Straits	1
of	1
Sunda,	1
the	1
vast	1
host	1
would	1
only	1
deploy	1
into	1
the	1
Oriental	1
seas	1
to	1
witness	1
the	1
capture	1
of	1
not	1
a	1
few	1
of	1
their	1
number.	1
And	1
who	1
could	1
tell	1
whether,	1
in	1
that	1
congregated	1
caravan,	1
Moby	1
Dick	1
himself	1
might	1
not	1
temporarily	1
be	1
swimming,	1
like	1
the	1
worshipped	1
white-elephant	1
in	1
the	1
coronation	1
procession	1
of	1
the	1
Siamese!	1
So	1
with	1
stun-sail	1
piled	1
on	1
stun-sail,	1
we	1
sailed	1
along,	1
driving	1
these	1
leviathans	1
before	1
us;	1
when,	1
of	1
a	1
sudden,	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
Tashtego	1
was	1
heard,	1
loudly	1
directing	1
attention	1
to	1
something	1
in	1
our	1
wake.	1
Corresponding	1
to	1
the	1
crescent	1
in	1
our	1
van,	1
we	1
beheld	1
another	1
in	1
our	1
rear.	1
It	1
seemed	1
formed	1
of	1
detached	1
white	1
vapours,	1
rising	1
and	1
falling	1
something	1
like	1
the	1
spouts	1
of	1
the	1
whales;	1
only	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
so	1
completely	1
come	1
and	1
go;	1
for	1
they	1
constantly	1
hovered,	1
without	1
finally	1
disappearing.	1
Levelling	1
his	1
glass	1
at	1
this	1
sight,	1
Ahab	1
quickly	1
revolved	1
in	1
his	1
pivot-hole,	1
crying,	1
"Aloft	1
there,	1
and	1
rig	1
whips	1
and	1
buckets	1
to	1
wet	1
the	1
sails;--Malays,	1
sir,	1
and	1
after	1
us!"	1
As	1
if	1
too	1
long	1
lurking	1
behind	1
the	1
headlands,	1
till	1
the	1
Pequod	1
should	1
fairly	1
have	1
entered	1
the	1
straits,	1
these	1
rascally	1
Asiatics	1
were	1
now	1
in	1
hot	1
pursuit,	1
to	1
make	1
up	1
for	1
their	1
over-cautious	1
delay.	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
swift	1
Pequod,	1
with	1
a	1
fresh	1
leading	1
wind,	1
was	1
herself	1
in	1
hot	1
chase;	1
how	1
very	1
kind	1
of	1
these	1
tawny	1
philanthropists	1
to	1
assist	1
in	1
speeding	1
her	1
on	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
chosen	1
pursuit,--mere	1
riding-whips	1
and	1
rowels	1
to	1
her,	1
that	1
they	1
were.	1
As	1
with	1
glass	1
under	1
arm,	1
Ahab	1
to-and-fro	1
paced	1
the	1
deck;	1
in	1
his	1
forward	1
turn	1
beholding	1
the	1
monsters	1
he	1
chased,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
after	1
one	1
the	1
bloodthirsty	1
pirates	1
chasing	1
him;	1
some	1
such	1
fancy	1
as	1
the	1
above	1
seemed	1
his.	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
glanced	1
upon	1
the	1
green	1
walls	1
of	1
the	1
watery	1
defile	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
ship	1
was	1
then	1
sailing,	1
and	1
bethought	1
him	1
that	1
through	1
that	1
gate	1
lay	1
the	1
route	1
to	1
his	1
vengeance,	1
and	1
beheld,	1
how	1
that	1
through	1
that	1
same	1
gate	1
he	1
was	1
now	1
both	1
chasing	1
and	1
being	1
chased	1
to	1
his	1
deadly	1
end;	1
and	1
not	1
only	1
that,	1
but	1
a	1
herd	1
of	1
remorseless	1
wild	1
pirates	1
and	1
inhuman	1
atheistical	1
devils	1
were	1
infernally	1
cheering	1
him	1
on	1
with	1
their	1
curses;--when	1
all	1
these	1
conceits	1
had	1
passed	1
through	1
his	1
brain,	1
Ahab's	1
brow	1
was	1
left	1
gaunt	1
and	1
ribbed,	1
like	1
the	1
black	1
sand	1
beach	1
after	1
some	1
stormy	1
tide	1
has	1
been	1
gnawing	1
it,	1
without	1
being	1
able	1
to	1
drag	1
the	1
firm	1
thing	1
from	1
its	1
place.	1
But	1
thoughts	1
like	1
these	1
troubled	1
very	1
few	1
of	1
the	1
reckless	1
crew;	1
and	1
when,	1
after	1
steadily	1
dropping	1
and	1
dropping	1
the	1
pirates	1
astern,	1
the	1
Pequod	1
at	1
last	1
shot	1
by	1
the	1
vivid	1
green	1
Cockatoo	1
Point	1
on	1
the	1
Sumatra	1
side,	1
emerging	1
at	1
last	1
upon	1
the	1
broad	1
waters	1
beyond;	1
then,	1
the	1
harpooneers	1
seemed	1
more	1
to	1
grieve	1
that	1
the	1
swift	1
whales	1
had	1
been	1
gaining	1
upon	1
the	1
ship,	1
than	1
to	1
rejoice	1
that	1
the	1
ship	1
had	1
so	1
victoriously	1
gained	1
upon	1
the	1
Malays.	1
But	1
still	1
driving	1
on	1
in	1
the	1
wake	1
of	1
the	1
whales,	1
at	1
length	1
they	1
seemed	1
abating	1
their	1
speed;	1
gradually	1
the	1
ship	1
neared	1
them;	1
and	1
the	1
wind	1
now	1
dying	1
away,	1
word	1
was	1
passed	1
to	1
spring	1
to	1
the	1
boats.	1
But	1
no	1
sooner	1
did	1
the	1
herd,	1
by	1
some	1
presumed	1
wonderful	1
instinct	1
of	1
the	1
Sperm	1
Whale,	1
become	1
notified	1
of	1
the	1
three	1
keels	1
that	1
were	1
after	1
them,--though	1
as	1
yet	1
a	1
mile	1
in	1
their	1
rear,--than	1
they	1
rallied	1
again,	1
and	1
forming	1
in	1
close	1
ranks	1
and	1
battalions,	1
so	1
that	1
their	1
spouts	1
all	1
looked	1
like	1
flashing	1
lines	1
of	1
stacked	1
bayonets,	1
moved	1
on	1
with	1
redoubled	1
velocity.	1
Stripped	1
to	1
our	1
shirts	1
and	1
drawers,	1
we	1
sprang	1
to	1
the	1
white-ash,	1
and	1
after	1
several	1
hours'	1
pulling	1
were	1
almost	1
disposed	1
to	1
renounce	1
the	1
chase,	1
when	1
a	1
general	1
pausing	1
commotion	1
among	1
the	1
whales	1
gave	1
animating	1
token	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
now	1
at	1
last	1
under	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
that	1
strange	1
perplexity	1
of	1
inert	1
irresolution,	1
which,	1
when	1
the	1
fishermen	1
perceive	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
whale,	1
they	1
say	1
he	1
is	1
gallied.	1
The	1
compact	1
martial	1
columns	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
hitherto	1
rapidly	1
and	1
steadily	1
swimming,	1
were	1
now	1
broken	1
up	1
in	1
one	1
measureless	1
rout;	1
and	1
like	1
King	1
Porus'	1
elephants	1
in	1
the	1
Indian	1
battle	1
with	1
Alexander,	1
they	1
seemed	1
going	1
mad	1
with	1
consternation.	1
In	1
all	1
directions	1
expanding	1
in	1
vast	1
irregular	1
circles,	1
and	1
aimlessly	1
swimming	1
hither	1
and	1
thither,	1
by	1
their	1
short	1
thick	1
spoutings,	1
they	1
plainly	1
betrayed	1
their	1
distraction	1
of	1
panic.	1
This	1
was	1
still	1
more	1
strangely	1
evinced	1
by	1
those	1
of	1
their	1
number,	1
who,	1
completely	1
paralysed	1
as	1
it	1
were,	1
helplessly	1
floated	1
like	1
water-logged	1
dismantled	1
ships	1
on	1
the	1
sea.	1
Had	1
these	1
Leviathans	1
been	1
but	1
a	1
flock	1
of	1
simple	1
sheep,	1
pursued	1
over	1
the	1
pasture	1
by	1
three	1
fierce	1
wolves,	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
possibly	1
have	1
evinced	1
such	1
excessive	1
dismay.	1
But	1
this	1
occasional	1
timidity	1
is	1
characteristic	1
of	1
almost	1
all	1
herding	1
creatures.	1
Though	1
banding	1
together	1
in	1
tens	1
of	1
thousands,	1
the	1
lion-maned	1
buffaloes	1
of	1
the	1
West	1
have	1
fled	1
before	1
a	1
solitary	1
horseman.	1
Witness,	1
too,	1
all	1
human	1
beings,	1
how	1
when	1
herded	1
together	1
in	1
the	1
sheepfold	1
of	1
a	1
theatre's	1
pit,	1
they	1
will,	1
at	1
the	1
slightest	1
alarm	1
of	1
fire,	1
rush	1
helter-skelter	1
for	1
the	1
outlets,	1
crowding,	1
trampling,	1
jamming,	1
and	1
remorselessly	1
dashing	1
each	1
other	1
to	1
death.	1
Best,	1
therefore,	1
withhold	1
any	1
amazement	1
at	1
the	1
strangely	1
gallied	1
whales	1
before	1
us,	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
folly	1
of	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
which	1
is	1
not	1
infinitely	1
outdone	1
by	1
the	1
madness	1
of	1
men.	1
Though	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
whales,	1
as	1
has	1
been	1
said,	1
were	1
in	1
violent	1
motion,	1
yet	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
observed	1
that	1
as	1
a	1
whole	1
the	1
herd	1
neither	1
advanced	1
nor	1
retreated,	1
but	1
collectively	1
remained	1
in	1
one	1
place.	1
As	1
is	1
customary	1
in	1
those	1
cases,	1
the	1
boats	1
at	1
once	1
separated,	1
each	1
making	1
for	1
some	1
one	1
lone	1
whale	1
on	1
the	1
outskirts	1
of	1
the	1
shoal.	1
In	1
about	1
three	1
minutes'	1
time,	1
Queequeg's	1
harpoon	1
was	1
flung;	1
the	1
stricken	1
fish	1
darted	1
blinding	1
spray	1
in	1
our	1
faces,	1
and	1
then	1
running	1
away	1
with	1
us	1
like	1
light,	1
steered	1
straight	1
for	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
the	1
herd.	1
Though	1
such	1
a	1
movement	1
on	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
whale	1
struck	1
under	1
such	1
circumstances,	1
is	1
in	1
no	1
wise	1
unprecedented;	1
and	1
indeed	1
is	1
almost	1
always	1
more	1
or	1
less	1
anticipated;	1
yet	1
does	1
it	1
present	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
more	1
perilous	1
vicissitudes	1
of	1
the	1
fishery.	1
For	1
as	1
the	1
swift	1
monster	1
drags	1
you	1
deeper	1
and	1
deeper	1
into	1
the	1
frantic	1
shoal,	1
you	1
bid	1
adieu	1
to	1
circumspect	1
life	1
and	1
only	1
exist	1
in	1
a	1
delirious	1
throb.	1
As,	1
blind	1
and	1
deaf,	1
the	1
whale	1
plunged	1
forward,	1
as	1
if	1
by	1
sheer	1
power	1
of	1
speed	1
to	1
rid	1
himself	1
of	1
the	1
iron	1
leech	1
that	1
had	1
fastened	1
to	1
him;	1
as	1
we	1
thus	1
tore	1
a	1
white	1
gash	1
in	1
the	1
sea,	1
on	1
all	1
sides	1
menaced	1
as	1
we	1
flew,	1
by	1
the	1
crazed	1
creatures	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
rushing	1
about	1
us;	1
our	1
beset	1
boat	1
was	1
like	1
a	1
ship	1
mobbed	1
by	1
ice-isles	1
in	1
a	1
tempest,	1
and	1
striving	1
to	1
steer	1
through	1
their	1
complicated	1
channels	1
and	1
straits,	1
knowing	1
not	1
at	1
what	1
moment	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
locked	1
in	1
and	1
crushed.	1
But	1
not	1
a	1
bit	1
daunted,	1
Queequeg	1
steered	1
us	1
manfully;	1
now	1
sheering	1
off	1
from	1
this	1
monster	1
directly	1
across	1
our	1
route	1
in	1
advance;	1
now	1
edging	1
away	1
from	1
that,	1
whose	1
colossal	1
flukes	1
were	1
suspended	1
overhead,	1
while	1
all	1
the	1
time,	1
Starbuck	1
stood	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
bows,	1
lance	1
in	1
hand,	1
pricking	1
out	1
of	1
our	1
way	1
whatever	1
whales	1
he	1
could	1
reach	1
by	1
short	1
darts,	1
for	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
time	1
to	1
make	1
long	1
ones.	1
Nor	1
were	1
the	1
oarsmen	1
quite	1
idle,	1
though	1
their	1
wonted	1
duty	1
was	1
now	1
altogether	1
dispensed	1
with.	1
They	1
chiefly	1
attended	1
to	1
the	1
shouting	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
business.	1
"Out	1
of	1
the	1
way,	1
Commodore!"	1
cried	1
one,	1
to	1
a	1
great	1
dromedary	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
sudden	1
rose	1
bodily	1
to	1
the	1
surface,	1
and	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
threatened	1
to	1
swamp	1
us.	1
"Hard	1
down	1
with	1
your	1
tail,	1
there!"	1
cried	1
a	1
second	1
to	1
another,	1
which,	1
close	1
to	1
our	1
gunwale,	1
seemed	1
calmly	1
cooling	1
himself	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
fan-like	1
extremity.	1
All	1
whaleboats	1
carry	1
certain	1
curious	1
contrivances,	1
originally	1
invented	1
by	1
the	1
Nantucket	1
Indians,	1
called	1
druggs.	1
Two	1
thick	1
squares	1
of	1
wood	1
of	1
equal	1
size	1
are	1
stoutly	1
clenched	1
together,	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
cross	1
each	1
other's	1
grain	1
at	1
right	1
angles;	1
a	1
line	1
of	1
considerable	1
length	1
is	1
then	1
attached	1
to	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
this	1
block,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
line	1
being	1
looped,	1
it	1
can	1
in	1
a	1
moment	1
be	1
fastened	1
to	1
a	1
harpoon.	1
It	1
is	1
chiefly	1
among	1
gallied	1
whales	1
that	1
this	1
drugg	1
is	1
used.	1
For	1
then,	1
more	1
whales	1
are	1
close	1
round	1
you	1
than	1
you	1
can	1
possibly	1
chase	1
at	1
one	1
time.	1
But	1
sperm	1
whales	1
are	1
not	1
every	1
day	1
encountered;	1
while	1
you	1
may,	1
then,	1
you	1
must	1
kill	1
all	1
you	1
can.	1
And	1
if	1
you	1
cannot	1
kill	1
them	1
all	1
at	1
once,	1
you	1
must	1
wing	1
them,	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
can	1
be	1
afterwards	1
killed	1
at	1
your	1
leisure.	1
Hence	1
it	1
is,	1
that	1
at	1
times	1
like	1
these	1
the	1
drugg,	1
comes	1
into	1
requisition.	1
Our	1
boat	1
was	1
furnished	1
with	1
three	1
of	1
them.	1
The	1
first	1
and	1
second	1
were	1
successfully	1
darted,	1
and	1
we	1
saw	1
the	1
whales	1
staggeringly	1
running	1
off,	1
fettered	1
by	1
the	1
enormous	1
sidelong	1
resistance	1
of	1
the	1
towing	1
drugg.	1
They	1
were	1
cramped	1
like	1
malefactors	1
with	1
the	1
chain	1
and	1
ball.	1
But	1
upon	1
flinging	1
the	1
third,	1
in	1
the	1
act	1
of	1
tossing	1
overboard	1
the	1
clumsy	1
wooden	1
block,	1
it	1
caught	1
under	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
seats	1
of	1
the	1
boat,	1
and	1
in	1
an	1
instant	1
tore	1
it	1
out	1
and	1
carried	1
it	1
away,	1
dropping	1
the	1
oarsman	1
in	1
the	1
boat's	1
bottom	1
as	1
the	1
seat	1
slid	1
from	1
under	1
him.	1
On	1
both	1
sides	1
the	1
sea	1
came	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
wounded	1
planks,	1
but	1
we	1
stuffed	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
drawers	1
and	1
shirts	1
in,	1
and	1
so	1
stopped	1
the	1
leaks	1
for	1
the	1
time.	1
It	1
had	1
been	1
next	1
to	1
impossible	1
to	1
dart	1
these	1
drugged-harpoons,	1
were	1
it	1
not	1
that	1
as	1
we	1
advanced	1
into	1
the	1
herd,	1
our	1
whale's	1
way	1
greatly	1
diminished;	1
moreover,	1
that	1
as	1
we	1
went	1
still	1
further	1
and	1
further	1
from	1
the	1
circumference	1
of	1
commotion,	1
the	1
direful	1
disorders	1
seemed	1
waning.	1
So	1
that	1
when	1
at	1
last	1
the	1
jerking	1
harpoon	1
drew	1
out,	1
and	1
the	1
towing	1
whale	1
sideways	1
vanished;	1
then,	1
with	1
the	1
tapering	1
force	1
of	1
his	1
parting	1
momentum,	1
we	1
glided	1
between	1
two	1
whales	1
into	1
the	1
innermost	1
heart	1
of	1
the	1
shoal,	1
as	1
if	1
from	1
some	1
mountain	1
torrent	1
we	1
had	1
slid	1
into	1
a	1
serene	1
valley	1
lake.	1
Here	1
the	1
storms	1
in	1
the	1
roaring	1
glens	1
between	1
the	1
outermost	1
whales,	1
were	1
heard	1
but	1
not	1
felt.	1
In	1
this	1
central	1
expanse	1
the	1
sea	1
presented	1
that	1
smooth	1
satin-like	1
surface,	1
called	1
a	1
sleek,	1
produced	1
by	1
the	1
subtle	1
moisture	1
thrown	1
off	1
by	1
the	1
whale	1
in	1
his	1
more	1
quiet	1
moods.	1
Yes,	1
we	1
were	1
now	1
in	1
that	1
enchanted	1
calm	1
which	1
they	1
say	1
lurks	1
at	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
every	1
commotion.	1
And	1
still	1
in	1
the	1
distracted	1
distance	1
we	1
beheld	1
the	1
tumults	1
of	1
the	1
outer	1
concentric	1
circles,	1
and	1
saw	1
successive	1
pods	1
of	1
whales,	1
eight	1
or	1
ten	1
in	1
each,	1
swiftly	1
going	1
round	1
and	1
round,	1
like	1
multiplied	1
spans	1
of	1
horses	1
in	1
a	1
ring;	1
and	1
so	1
closely	1
shoulder	1
to	1
shoulder,	1
that	1
a	1
Titanic	1
circus-rider	1
might	1
easily	1
have	1
over-arched	1
the	1
middle	1
ones,	1
and	1
so	1
have	1
gone	1
round	1
on	1
their	1
backs.	1
Owing	1
to	1
the	1
density	1
of	1
the	1
crowd	1
of	1
reposing	1
whales,	1
more	1
immediately	1
surrounding	1
the	1
embayed	1
axis	1
of	1
the	1
herd,	1
no	1
possible	1
chance	1
of	1
escape	1
was	1
at	1
present	1
afforded	1
us.	1
We	1
must	1
watch	1
for	1
a	1
breach	1
in	1
the	1
living	1
wall	1
that	1
hemmed	1
us	1
in;	1
the	1
wall	1
that	1
had	1
only	1
admitted	1
us	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
shut	1
us	1
up.	1
Keeping	1
at	1
the	1
centre	1
of	1
the	1
lake,	1
we	1
were	1
occasionally	1
visited	1
by	1
small	1
tame	1
cows	1
and	1
calves;	1
the	1
women	1
and	1
children	1
of	1
this	1
routed	1
host.	1
Now,	1
inclusive	1
of	1
the	1
occasional	1
wide	1
intervals	1
between	1
the	1
revolving	1
outer	1
circles,	1
and	1
inclusive	1
of	1
the	1
spaces	1
between	1
the	1
various	1
pods	1
in	1
any	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
circles,	1
the	1
entire	1
area	1
at	1
this	1
juncture,	1
embraced	1
by	1
the	1
whole	1
multitude,	1
must	1
have	1
contained	1
at	1
least	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
square	1
miles.	1
At	1
any	1
rate--though	1
indeed	1
such	1
a	1
test	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
time	1
might	1
be	1
deceptive--spoutings	1
might	1
be	1
discovered	1
from	1
our	1
low	1
boat	1
that	1
seemed	1
playing	1
up	1
almost	1
from	1
the	1
rim	1
of	1
the	1
horizon.	1
I	1
mention	1
this	1
circumstance,	1
because,	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
cows	1
and	1
calves	1
had	1
been	1
purposely	1
locked	1
up	1
in	1
this	1
innermost	1
fold;	1
and	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
wide	1
extent	1
of	1
the	1
herd	1
had	1
hitherto	1
prevented	1
them	1
from	1
learning	1
the	1
precise	1
cause	1
of	1
its	1
stopping;	1
or,	1
possibly,	1
being	1
so	1
young,	1
unsophisticated,	1
and	1
every	1
way	1
innocent	1
and	1
inexperienced;	1
however	1
it	1
may	1
have	1
been,	1
these	1
smaller	1
whales--now	1
and	1
then	1
visiting	1
our	1
becalmed	1
boat	1
from	1
the	1
margin	1
of	1
the	1
lake--evinced	1
a	1
wondrous	1
fearlessness	1
and	1
confidence,	1
or	1
else	1
a	1
still	1
becharmed	1
panic	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
not	1
to	1
marvel	1
at.	1
Like	1
household	1
dogs	1
they	1
came	1
snuffling	1
round	1
us,	1
right	1
up	1
to	1
our	1
gunwales,	1
and	1
touching	1
them;	1
till	1
it	1
almost	1
seemed	1
that	1
some	1
spell	1
had	1
suddenly	1
domesticated	1
them.	1
Queequeg	1
patted	1
their	1
foreheads;	1
Starbuck	1
scratched	1
their	1
backs	1
with	1
his	1
lance;	1
but	1
fearful	1
of	1
the	1
consequences,	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
refrained	1
from	1
darting	1
it.	1
But	1
far	1
beneath	1
this	1
wondrous	1
world	1
upon	1
the	1
surface,	1
another	1
and	1
still	1
stranger	1
world	1
met	1
our	1
eyes	1
as	1
we	1
gazed	1
over	1
the	1
side.	1
For,	1
suspended	1
in	1
those	1
watery	1
vaults,	1
floated	1
the	1
forms	1
of	1
the	1
nursing	1
mothers	1
of	1
the	1
whales,	1
and	1
those	1
that	1
by	1
their	1
enormous	1
girth	1
seemed	1
shortly	1
to	1
become	1
mothers.	1
The	1
lake,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
hinted,	1
was	1
to	1
a	1
considerable	1
depth	1
exceedingly	1
transparent;	1
and	1
as	1
human	1
infants	1
while	1
suckling	1
will	1
calmly	1
and	1
fixedly	1
gaze	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
breast,	1
as	1
if	1
leading	1
two	1
different	1
lives	1
at	1
the	1
time;	1
and	1
while	1
yet	1
drawing	1
mortal	1
nourishment,	1
be	1
still	1
spiritually	1
feasting	1
upon	1
some	1
unearthly	1
reminiscence;--even	1
so	1
did	1
the	1
young	1
of	1
these	1
whales	1
seem	1
looking	1
up	1
towards	1
us,	1
but	1
not	1
at	1
us,	1
as	1
if	1
we	1
were	1
but	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
Gulfweed	1
in	1
their	1
new-born	1
sight.	1
Floating	1
on	1
their	1
sides,	1
the	1
mothers	1
also	1
seemed	1
quietly	1
eyeing	1
us.	1
One	1
of	1
these	1
little	1
infants,	1
that	1
from	1
certain	1
queer	1
tokens	1
seemed	1
hardly	1
a	1
day	1
old,	1
might	1
have	1
measured	1
some	1
fourteen	1
feet	1
in	1
length,	1
and	1
some	1
six	1
feet	1
in	1
girth.	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
frisky;	1
though	1
as	1
yet	1
his	1
body	1
seemed	1
scarce	1
yet	1
recovered	1
from	1
that	1
irksome	1
position	1
it	1
had	1
so	1
lately	1
occupied	1
in	1
the	1
maternal	1
reticule;	1
where,	1
tail	1
to	1
head,	1
and	1
all	1
ready	1
for	1
the	1
final	1
spring,	1
the	1
unborn	1
whale	1
lies	1
bent	1
like	1
a	1
Tartar's	1
bow.	1
The	1
delicate	1
side-fins,	1
and	1
the	1
palms	1
of	1
his	1
flukes,	1
still	1
freshly	1
retained	1
the	1
plaited	1
crumpled	1
appearance	1
of	1
a	1
baby's	1
ears	1
newly	1
arrived	1
from	1
foreign	1
parts.	1
"Line!	1
line!"	1
cried	1
Queequeg,	1
looking	1
over	1
the	1
gunwale;	1
"him	1
fast!	1
him	1
fast!--Who	1
line	1
him!	1
Who	1
struck?--Two	1
whale;	1
one	1
big,	1
one	1
little!"	1
"What	1
ails	1
ye,	1
man?"	1
cried	1
Starbuck.	1
"Look-e	1
here,"	1
said	1
Queequeg,	1
pointing	1
down.	1
As	1
when	1
the	1
stricken	1
whale,	1
that	1
from	1
the	1
tub	1
has	1
reeled	1
out	1
hundreds	1
of	1
fathoms	1
of	1
rope;	1
as,	1
after	1
deep	1
sounding,	1
he	1
floats	1
up	1
again,	1
and	1
shows	1
the	1
slackened	1
curling	1
line	1
buoyantly	1
rising	1
and	1
spiralling	1
towards	1
the	1
air;	1
so	1
now,	1
Starbuck	1
saw	1
long	1
coils	1
of	1
the	1
umbilical	1
cord	1
of	1
Madame	1
Leviathan,	1
by	1
which	1
the	1
young	1
cub	1
seemed	1
still	1
tethered	1
to	1
its	1
dam.	1
Not	1
seldom	1
in	1
the	1
rapid	1
vicissitudes	1
of	1
the	1
chase,	1
this	1
natural	1
line,	1
with	1
the	1
maternal	1
end	1
loose,	1
becomes	1
entangled	1
with	1
the	1
hempen	1
one,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
cub	1
is	1
thereby	1
trapped.	1
Some	1
of	1
the	1
subtlest	1
secrets	1
of	1
the	1
seas	1
seemed	1
divulged	1
to	1
us	1
in	1
this	1
enchanted	1
pond.	1
We	1
saw	1
young	1
Leviathan	1
amours	1
in	1
the	1
deep.*	1
*The	1
sperm	1
whale,	1
as	1
with	1
all	1
other	1
species	1
of	1
the	1
Leviathan,	1
but	1
unlike	1
most	1
other	1
fish,	1
breeds	1
indifferently	1
at	1
all	1
seasons;	1
after	1
a	1
gestation	1
which	1
may	1
probably	1
be	1
set	1
down	1
at	1
nine	1
months,	1
producing	1
but	1
one	1
at	1
a	1
time;	1
though	1
in	1
some	1
few	1
known	1
instances	1
giving	1
birth	1
to	1
an	1
Esau	1
and	1
Jacob:--a	1
contingency	1
provided	1
for	1
in	1
suckling	1
by	1
two	1
teats,	1
curiously	1
situated,	1
one	1
on	1
each	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
anus;	1
but	1
the	1
breasts	1
themselves	1
extend	1
upwards	1
from	1
that.	1
When	1
by	1
chance	1
these	1
precious	1
parts	1
in	1
a	1
nursing	1
whale	1
are	1
cut	1
by	1
the	1
hunter's	1
lance,	1
the	1
mother's	1
pouring	1
milk	1
and	1
blood	1
rivallingly	1
discolour	1
the	1
sea	1
for	1
rods.	1
The	1
milk	1
is	1
very	1
sweet	1
and	1
rich;	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
tasted	1
by	1
man;	1
it	1
might	1
do	1
well	1
with	1
strawberries.	1
When	1
overflowing	1
with	1
mutual	1
esteem,	1
the	1
whales	1
salute	1
MORE	1
HOMINUM.	1
And	1
thus,	1
though	1
surrounded	1
by	1
circle	1
upon	1
circle	1
of	1
consternations	1
and	1
affrights,	1
did	1
these	1
inscrutable	1
creatures	1
at	1
the	1
centre	1
freely	1
and	1
fearlessly	1
indulge	1
in	1
all	1
peaceful	1
concernments;	1
yea,	1
serenely	1
revelled	1
in	1
dalliance	1
and	1
delight.	1
But	1
even	1
so,	1
amid	1
the	1
tornadoed	1
Atlantic	1
of	1
my	1
being,	1
do	1
I	1
myself	1
still	1
for	1
ever	1
centrally	1
disport	1
in	1
mute	1
calm;	1
and	1
while	1
ponderous	1
planets	1
of	1
unwaning	1
woe	1
revolve	1
round	1
me,	1
deep	1
down	1
and	1
deep	1
inland	1
there	1
I	1
still	1
bathe	1
me	1
in	1
eternal	1
mildness	1
of	1
joy.	1
Meanwhile,	1
as	1
we	1
thus	1
lay	1
entranced,	1
the	1
occasional	1
sudden	1
frantic	1
spectacles	1
in	1
the	1
distance	1
evinced	1
the	1
activity	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
boats,	1
still	1
engaged	1
in	1
drugging	1
the	1
whales	1
on	1
the	1
frontier	1
of	1
the	1
host;	1
or	1
possibly	1
carrying	1
on	1
the	1
war	1
within	1
the	1
first	1
circle,	1
where	1
abundance	1
of	1
room	1
and	1
some	1
convenient	1
retreats	1
were	1
afforded	1
them.	1
But	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
enraged	1
drugged	1
whales	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
blindly	1
darting	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
across	1
the	1
circles,	1
was	1
nothing	1
to	1
what	1
at	1
last	1
met	1
our	1
eyes.	1
It	1
is	1
sometimes	1
the	1
custom	1
when	1
fast	1
to	1
a	1
whale	1
more	1
than	1
commonly	1
powerful	1
and	1
alert,	1
to	1
seek	1
to	1
hamstring	1
him,	1
as	1
it	1
were,	1
by	1
sundering	1
or	1
maiming	1
his	1
gigantic	1
tail-tendon.	1
It	1
is	1
done	1
by	1
darting	1
a	1
short-handled	1
cutting-spade,	1
to	1
which	1
is	1
attached	1
a	1
rope	1
for	1
hauling	1
it	1
back	1
again.	1
A	1
whale	1
wounded	1
(as	1
we	1
afterwards	1
learned)	1
in	1
this	1
part,	1
but	1
not	1
effectually,	1
as	1
it	1
seemed,	1
had	1
broken	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
boat,	1
carrying	1
along	1
with	1
him	1
half	1
of	1
the	1
harpoon	1
line;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
extraordinary	1
agony	1
of	1
the	1
wound,	1
he	1
was	1
now	1
dashing	1
among	1
the	1
revolving	1
circles	1
like	1
the	1
lone	1
mounted	1
desperado	1
Arnold,	1
at	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Saratoga,	1
carrying	1
dismay	1
wherever	1
he	1
went.	1
But	1
agonizing	1
as	1
was	1
the	1
wound	1
of	1
this	1
whale,	1
and	1
an	1
appalling	1
spectacle	1
enough,	1
any	1
way;	1
yet	1
the	1
peculiar	1
horror	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
inspire	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
herd,	1
was	1
owing	1
to	1
a	1
cause	1
which	1
at	1
first	1
the	1
intervening	1
distance	1
obscured	1
from	1
us.	1
But	1
at	1
length	1
we	1
perceived	1
that	1
by	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
unimaginable	1
accidents	1
of	1
the	1
fishery,	1
this	1
whale	1
had	1
become	1
entangled	1
in	1
the	1
harpoon-line	1
that	1
he	1
towed;	1
he	1
had	1
also	1
run	1
away	1
with	1
the	1
cutting-spade	1
in	1
him;	1
and	1
while	1
the	1
free	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
rope	1
attached	1
to	1
that	1
weapon,	1
had	1
permanently	1
caught	1
in	1
the	1
coils	1
of	1
the	1
harpoon-line	1
round	1
his	1
tail,	1
the	1
cutting-spade	1
itself	1
had	1
worked	1
loose	1
from	1
his	1
flesh.	1
So	1
that	1
tormented	1
to	1
madness,	1
he	1
was	1
now	1
churning	1
through	1
the	1
water,	1
violently	1
flailing	1
with	1
his	1
flexible	1
tail,	1
and	1
tossing	1
the	1
keen	1
spade	1
about	1
him,	1
wounding	1
and	1
murdering	1
his	1
own	1
comrades.	1
This	1
terrific	1
object	1
seemed	1
to	1
recall	1
the	1
whole	1
herd	1
from	1
their	1
stationary	1
fright.	1
First,	1
the	1
whales	1
forming	1
the	1
margin	1
of	1
our	1
lake	1
began	1
to	1
crowd	1
a	1
little,	1
and	1
tumble	1
against	1
each	1
other,	1
as	1
if	1
lifted	1
by	1
half	1
spent	1
billows	1
from	1
afar;	1
then	1
the	1
lake	1
itself	1
began	1
faintly	1
to	1
heave	1
and	1
swell;	1
the	1
submarine	1
bridal-chambers	1
and	1
nurseries	1
vanished;	1
in	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
contracting	1
orbits	1
the	1
whales	1
in	1
the	1
more	1
central	1
circles	1
began	1
to	1
swim	1
in	1
thickening	1
clusters.	1
Yes,	1
the	1
long	1
calm	1
was	1
departing.	1
A	1
low	1
advancing	1
hum	1
was	1
soon	1
heard;	1
and	1
then	1
like	1
to	1
the	1
tumultuous	1
masses	1
of	1
block-ice	1
when	1
the	1
great	1
river	1
Hudson	1
breaks	1
up	1
in	1
Spring,	1
the	1
entire	1
host	1
of	1
whales	1
came	1
tumbling	1
upon	1
their	1
inner	1
centre,	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
pile	1
themselves	1
up	1
in	1
one	1
common	1
mountain.	1
Instantly	1
Starbuck	1
and	1
Queequeg	1
changed	1
places;	1
Starbuck	1
taking	1
the	1
stern.	1
"Oars!	1
Oars!"	1
he	1
intensely	1
whispered,	1
seizing	1
the	1
helm--"gripe	1
your	1
oars,	1
and	1
clutch	1
your	1
souls,	1
now!	1
My	1
God,	1
men,	1
stand	1
by!	1
Shove	1
him	1
off,	1
you	1
Queequeg--the	1
whale	1
there!--prick	1
him!--hit	1
him!	1
Stand	1
up--stand	1
up,	1
and	1
stay	1
so!	1
Spring,	1
men--pull,	1
men;	1
never	1
mind	1
their	1
backs--scrape	1
them!--scrape	1
away!"	1
The	1
boat	1
was	1
now	1
all	1
but	1
jammed	1
between	1
two	1
vast	1
black	1
bulks,	1
leaving	1
a	1
narrow	1
Dardanelles	1
between	1
their	1
long	1
lengths.	1
But	1
by	1
desperate	1
endeavor	1
we	1
at	1
last	1
shot	1
into	1
a	1
temporary	1
opening;	1
then	1
giving	1
way	1
rapidly,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
earnestly	1
watching	1
for	1
another	1
outlet.	1
After	1
many	1
similar	1
hair-breadth	1
escapes,	1
we	1
at	1
last	1
swiftly	1
glided	1
into	1
what	1
had	1
just	1
been	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
outer	1
circles,	1
but	1
now	1
crossed	1
by	1
random	1
whales,	1
all	1
violently	1
making	1
for	1
one	1
centre.	1
This	1
lucky	1
salvation	1
was	1
cheaply	1
purchased	1
by	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
Queequeg's	1
hat,	1
who,	1
while	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
bows	1
to	1
prick	1
the	1
fugitive	1
whales,	1
had	1
his	1
hat	1
taken	1
clean	1
from	1
his	1
head	1
by	1
the	1
air-eddy	1
made	1
by	1
the	1
sudden	1
tossing	1
of	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
broad	1
flukes	1
close	1
by.	1
Riotous	1
and	1
disordered	1
as	1
the	1
universal	1
commotion	1
now	1
was,	1
it	1
soon	1
resolved	1
itself	1
into	1
what	1
seemed	1
a	1
systematic	1
movement;	1
for	1
having	1
clumped	1
together	1
at	1
last	1
in	1
one	1
dense	1
body,	1
they	1
then	1
renewed	1
their	1
onward	1
flight	1
with	1
augmented	1
fleetness.	1
Further	1
pursuit	1
was	1
useless;	1
but	1
the	1
boats	1
still	1
lingered	1
in	1
their	1
wake	1
to	1
pick	1
up	1
what	1
drugged	1
whales	1
might	1
be	1
dropped	1
astern,	1
and	1
likewise	1
to	1
secure	1
one	1
which	1
Flask	1
had	1
killed	1
and	1
waifed.	1
The	1
waif	1
is	1
a	1
pennoned	1
pole,	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
of	1
which	1
are	1
carried	1
by	1
every	1
boat;	1
and	1
which,	1
when	1
additional	1
game	1
is	1
at	1
hand,	1
are	1
inserted	1
upright	1
into	1
the	1
floating	1
body	1
of	1
a	1
dead	1
whale,	1
both	1
to	1
mark	1
its	1
place	1
on	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
also	1
as	1
token	1
of	1
prior	1
possession,	1
should	1
the	1
boats	1
of	1
any	1
other	1
ship	1
draw	1
near.	1
The	1
result	1
of	1
this	1
lowering	1
was	1
somewhat	1
illustrative	1
of	1
that	1
sagacious	1
saying	1
in	1
the	1
Fishery,--the	1
more	1
whales	1
the	1
less	1
fish.	1
Of	1
all	1
the	1
drugged	1
whales	1
only	1
one	1
was	1
captured.	1
The	1
rest	1
contrived	1
to	1
escape	1
for	1
the	1
time,	1
but	1
only	1
to	1
be	1
taken,	1
as	1
will	1
hereafter	1
be	1
seen,	1
by	1
some	1
other	1
craft	1
than	1
the	1
Pequod.	1
CHAPTER	1
88	1
Schools	1
and	1
Schoolmasters.	1
The	1
previous	1
chapter	1
gave	1
account	1
of	1
an	1
immense	1
body	1
or	1
herd	1
of	1
Sperm	1
Whales,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
also	1
then	1
given	1
the	1
probable	1
cause	1
inducing	1
those	1
vast	1
aggregations.	1
Now,	1
though	1
such	1
great	1
bodies	1
are	1
at	1
times	1
encountered,	1
yet,	1
as	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
seen,	1
even	1
at	1
the	1
present	1
day,	1
small	1
detached	1
bands	1
are	1
occasionally	1
observed,	1
embracing	1
from	1
twenty	1
to	1
fifty	1
individuals	1
each.	1
Such	1
bands	1
are	1
known	1
as	1
schools.	1
They	1
generally	1
are	1
of	1
two	1
sorts;	1
those	1
composed	1
almost	1
entirely	1
of	1
females,	1
and	1
those	1
mustering	1
none	1
but	1
young	1
vigorous	1
males,	1
or	1
bulls,	1
as	1
they	1
are	1
familiarly	1
designated.	1
In	1
cavalier	1
attendance	1
upon	1
the	1
school	1
of	1
females,	1
you	1
invariably	1
see	1
a	1
male	1
of	1
full	1
grown	1
magnitude,	1
but	1
not	1
old;	1
who,	1
upon	1
any	1
alarm,	1
evinces	1
his	1
gallantry	1
by	1
falling	1
in	1
the	1
rear	1
and	1
covering	1
the	1
flight	1
of	1
his	1
ladies.	1
In	1
truth,	1
this	1
gentleman	1
is	1
a	1
luxurious	1
Ottoman,	1
swimming	1
about	1
over	1
the	1
watery	1
world,	1
surroundingly	1
accompanied	1
by	1
all	1
the	1
solaces	1
and	1
endearments	1
of	1
the	1
harem.	1
The	1
contrast	1
between	1
this	1
Ottoman	1
and	1
his	1
concubines	1
is	1
striking;	1
because,	1
while	1
he	1
is	1
always	1
of	1
the	1
largest	1
leviathanic	1
proportions,	1
the	1
ladies,	1
even	1
at	1
full	1
growth,	1
are	1
not	1
more	1
than	1
one-third	1
of	1
the	1
bulk	1
of	1
an	1
average-sized	1
male.	1
They	1
are	1
comparatively	1
delicate,	1
indeed;	1
I	1
dare	1
say,	1
not	1
to	1
exceed	1
half	1
a	1
dozen	1
yards	1
round	1
the	1
waist.	1
Nevertheless,	1
it	1
cannot	1
be	1
denied,	1
that	1
upon	1
the	1
whole	1
they	1
are	1
hereditarily	1
entitled	1
to	1
EMBONPOINT.	1
It	1
is	1
very	1
curious	1
to	1
watch	1
this	1
harem	1
and	1
its	1
lord	1
in	1
their	1
indolent	1
ramblings.	1
Like	1
fashionables,	1
they	1
are	1
for	1
ever	1
on	1
the	1
move	1
in	1
leisurely	1
search	1
of	1
variety.	1
You	1
meet	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
Line	1
in	1
time	1
for	1
the	1
full	1
flower	1
of	1
the	1
Equatorial	1
feeding	1
season,	1
having	1
just	1
returned,	1
perhaps,	1
from	1
spending	1
the	1
summer	1
in	1
the	1
Northern	1
seas,	1
and	1
so	1
cheating	1
summer	1
of	1
all	1
unpleasant	1
weariness	1
and	1
warmth.	1
By	1
the	1
time	1
they	1
have	1
lounged	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
promenade	1
of	1
the	1
Equator	1
awhile,	1
they	1
start	1
for	1
the	1
Oriental	1
waters	1
in	1
anticipation	1
of	1
the	1
cool	1
season	1
there,	1
and	1
so	1
evade	1
the	1
other	1
excessive	1
temperature	1
of	1
the	1
year.	1
When	1
serenely	1
advancing	1
on	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
journeys,	1
if	1
any	1
strange	1
suspicious	1
sights	1
are	1
seen,	1
my	1
lord	1
whale	1
keeps	1
a	1
wary	1
eye	1
on	1
his	1
interesting	1
family.	1
Should	1
any	1
unwarrantably	1
pert	1
young	1
Leviathan	1
coming	1
that	1
way,	1
presume	1
to	1
draw	1
confidentially	1
close	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
ladies,	1
with	1
what	1
prodigious	1
fury	1
the	1
Bashaw	1
assails	1
him,	1
and	1
chases	1
him	1
away!	1
High	1
times,	1
indeed,	1
if	1
unprincipled	1
young	1
rakes	1
like	1
him	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
permitted	1
to	1
invade	1
the	1
sanctity	1
of	1
domestic	1
bliss;	1
though	1
do	1
what	1
the	1
Bashaw	1
will,	1
he	1
cannot	1
keep	1
the	1
most	1
notorious	1
Lothario	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
bed;	1
for,	1
alas!	1
all	1
fish	1
bed	1
in	1
common.	1
As	1
ashore,	1
the	1
ladies	1
often	1
cause	1
the	1
most	1
terrible	1
duels	1
among	1
their	1
rival	1
admirers;	1
just	1
so	1
with	1
the	1
whales,	1
who	1
sometimes	1
come	1
to	1
deadly	1
battle,	1
and	1
all	1
for	1
love.	1
They	1
fence	1
with	1
their	1
long	1
lower	1
jaws,	1
sometimes	1
locking	1
them	1
together,	1
and	1
so	1
striving	1
for	1
the	1
supremacy	1
like	1
elks	1
that	1
warringly	1
interweave	1
their	1
antlers.	1
Not	1
a	1
few	1
are	1
captured	1
having	1
the	1
deep	1
scars	1
of	1
these	1
encounters,--furrowed	1
heads,	1
broken	1
teeth,	1
scolloped	1
fins;	1
and	1
in	1
some	1
instances,	1
wrenched	1
and	1
dislocated	1
mouths.	1
But	1
supposing	1
the	1
invader	1
of	1
domestic	1
bliss	1
to	1
betake	1
himself	1
away	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
rush	1
of	1
the	1
harem's	1
lord,	1
then	1
is	1
it	1
very	1
diverting	1
to	1
watch	1
that	1
lord.	1
Gently	1
he	1
insinuates	1
his	1
vast	1
bulk	1
among	1
them	1
again	1
and	1
revels	1
there	1
awhile,	1
still	1
in	1
tantalizing	1
vicinity	1
to	1
young	1
Lothario,	1
like	1
pious	1
Solomon	1
devoutly	1
worshipping	1
among	1
his	1
thousand	1
concubines.	1
Granting	1
other	1
whales	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
sight,	1
the	1
fishermen	1
will	1
seldom	1
give	1
chase	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
Grand	1
Turks;	1
for	1
these	1
Grand	1
Turks	1
are	1
too	1
lavish	1
of	1
their	1
strength,	1
and	1
hence	1
their	1
unctuousness	1
is	1
small.	1
As	1
for	1
the	1
sons	1
and	1
the	1
daughters	1
they	1
beget,	1
why,	1
those	1
sons	1
and	1
daughters	1
must	1
take	1
care	1
of	1
themselves;	1
at	1
least,	1
with	1
only	1
the	1
maternal	1
help.	1
For	1
like	1
certain	1
other	1
omnivorous	1
roving	1
lovers	1
that	1
might	1
be	1
named,	1
my	1
Lord	1
Whale	1
has	1
no	1
taste	1
for	1
the	1
nursery,	1
however	1
much	1
for	1
the	1
bower;	1
and	1
so,	1
being	1
a	1
great	1
traveller,	1
he	1
leaves	1
his	1
anonymous	1
babies	1
all	1
over	1
the	1
world;	1
every	1
baby	1
an	1
exotic.	1
In	1
good	1
time,	1
nevertheless,	1
as	1
the	1
ardour	1
of	1
youth	1
declines;	1
as	1
years	1
and	1
dumps	1
increase;	1
as	1
reflection	1
lends	1
her	1
solemn	1
pauses;	1
in	1
short,	1
as	1
a	1
general	1
lassitude	1
overtakes	1
the	1
sated	1
Turk;	1
then	1
a	1
love	1
of	1
ease	1
and	1
virtue	1
supplants	1
the	1
love	1
for	1
maidens;	1
our	1
Ottoman	1
enters	1
upon	1
the	1
impotent,	1
repentant,	1
admonitory	1
stage	1
of	1
life,	1
forswears,	1
disbands	1
the	1
harem,	1
and	1
grown	1
to	1
an	1
exemplary,	1
sulky	1
old	1
soul,	1
goes	1
about	1
all	1
alone	1
among	1
the	1
meridians	1
and	1
parallels	1
saying	1
his	1
prayers,	1
and	1
warning	1
each	1
young	1
Leviathan	1
from	1
his	1
amorous	1
errors.	1
Now,	1
as	1
the	1
harem	1
of	1
whales	1
is	1
called	1
by	1
the	1
fishermen	1
a	1
school,	1
so	1
is	1
the	1
lord	1
and	1
master	1
of	1
that	1
school	1
technically	1
known	1
as	1
the	1
schoolmaster.	1
It	1
is	1
therefore	1
not	1
in	1
strict	1
character,	1
however	1
admirably	1
satirical,	1
that	1
after	1
going	1
to	1
school	1
himself,	1
he	1
should	1
then	1
go	1
abroad	1
inculcating	1
not	1
what	1
he	1
learned	1
there,	1
but	1
the	1
folly	1
of	1
it.	1
His	1
title,	1
schoolmaster,	1
would	1
very	1
naturally	1
seem	1
derived	1
from	1
the	1
name	1
bestowed	1
upon	1
the	1
harem	1
itself,	1
but	1
some	1
have	1
surmised	1
that	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
first	1
thus	1
entitled	1
this	1
sort	1
of	1
Ottoman	1
whale,	1
must	1
have	1
read	1
the	1
memoirs	1
of	1
Vidocq,	1
and	1
informed	1
himself	1
what	1
sort	1
of	1
a	1
country-schoolmaster	1
that	1
famous	1
Frenchman	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
younger	1
days,	1
and	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
those	1
occult	1
lessons	1
he	1
inculcated	1
into	1
some	1
of	1
his	1
pupils.	1
The	1
same	1
secludedness	1
and	1
isolation	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
schoolmaster	1
whale	1
betakes	1
himself	1
in	1
his	1
advancing	1
years,	1
is	1
true	1
of	1
all	1
aged	1
Sperm	1
Whales.	1
Almost	1
universally,	1
a	1
lone	1
whale--as	1
a	1
solitary	1
Leviathan	1
is	1
called--proves	1
an	1
ancient	1
one.	1
Like	1
venerable	1
moss-bearded	1
Daniel	1
Boone,	1
he	1
will	1
have	1
no	1
one	1
near	1
him	1
but	1
Nature	1
herself;	1
and	1
her	1
he	1
takes	1
to	1
wife	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
waters,	1
and	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
wives	1
she	1
is,	1
though	1
she	1
keeps	1
so	1
many	1
moody	1
secrets.	1
The	1
schools	1
composing	1
none	1
but	1
young	1
and	1
vigorous	1
males,	1
previously	1
mentioned,	1
offer	1
a	1
strong	1
contrast	1
to	1
the	1
harem	1
schools.	1
For	1
while	1
those	1
female	1
whales	1
are	1
characteristically	1
timid,	1
the	1
young	1
males,	1
or	1
forty-barrel-bulls,	1
as	1
they	1
call	1
them,	1
are	1
by	1
far	1
the	1
most	1
pugnacious	1
of	1
all	1
Leviathans,	1
and	1
proverbially	1
the	1
most	1
dangerous	1
to	1
encounter;	1
excepting	1
those	1
wondrous	1
grey-headed,	1
grizzled	1
whales,	1
sometimes	1
met,	1
and	1
these	1
will	1
fight	1
you	1
like	1
grim	1
fiends	1
exasperated	1
by	1
a	1
penal	1
gout.	1
The	1
Forty-barrel-bull	1
schools	1
are	1
larger	1
than	1
the	1
harem	1
schools.	1
Like	1
a	1
mob	1
of	1
young	1
collegians,	1
they	1
are	1
full	1
of	1
fight,	1
fun,	1
and	1
wickedness,	1
tumbling	1
round	1
the	1
world	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
reckless,	1
rollicking	1
rate,	1
that	1
no	1
prudent	1
underwriter	1
would	1
insure	1
them	1
any	1
more	1
than	1
he	1
would	1
a	1
riotous	1
lad	1
at	1
Yale	1
or	1
Harvard.	1
They	1
soon	1
relinquish	1
this	1
turbulence	1
though,	1
and	1
when	1
about	1
three-fourths	1
grown,	1
break	1
up,	1
and	1
separately	1
go	1
about	1
in	1
quest	1
of	1
settlements,	1
that	1
is,	1
harems.	1
Another	1
point	1
of	1
difference	1
between	1
the	1
male	1
and	1
female	1
schools	1
is	1
still	1
more	1
characteristic	1
of	1
the	1
sexes.	1
Say	1
you	1
strike	1
a	1
Forty-barrel-bull--poor	1
devil!	1
all	1
his	1
comrades	1
quit	1
him.	1
But	1
strike	1
a	1
member	1
of	1
the	1
harem	1
school,	1
and	1
her	1
companions	1
swim	1
around	1
her	1
with	1
every	1
token	1
of	1
concern,	1
sometimes	1
lingering	1
so	1
near	1
her	1
and	1
so	1
long,	1
as	1
themselves	1
to	1
fall	1
a	1
prey.	1
CHAPTER	1
89	1
Fast-Fish	1
and	1
Loose-Fish.	1
The	1
allusion	1
to	1
the	1
waif	1
and	1
waif-poles	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
chapter	1
but	1
one,	1
necessitates	1
some	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
laws	1
and	1
regulations	1
of	1
the	1
whale	1
fishery,	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
waif	1
may	1
be	1
deemed	1
the	1
grand	1
symbol	1
and	1
badge.	1
It	1
frequently	1
happens	1
that	1
when	1
several	1
ships	1
are	1
cruising	1
in	1
company,	1
a	1
whale	1
may	1
be	1
struck	1
by	1
one	1
vessel,	1
then	1
escape,	1
and	1
be	1
finally	1
killed	1
and	1
captured	1
by	1
another	1
vessel;	1
and	1
herein	1
are	1
indirectly	1
comprised	1
many	1
minor	1
contingencies,	1
all	1
partaking	1
of	1
this	1
one	1
grand	1
feature.	1
For	1
example,--after	1
a	1
weary	1
and	1
perilous	1
chase	1
and	1
capture	1
of	1
a	1
whale,	1
the	1
body	1
may	1
get	1
loose	1
from	1
the	1
ship	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
a	1
violent	1
storm;	1
and	1
drifting	1
far	1
away	1
to	1
leeward,	1
be	1
retaken	1
by	1
a	1
second	1
whaler,	1
who,	1
in	1
a	1
calm,	1
snugly	1
tows	1
it	1
alongside,	1
without	1
risk	1
of	1
life	1
or	1
line.	1
Thus	1
the	1
most	1
vexatious	1
and	1
violent	1
disputes	1
would	1
often	1
arise	1
between	1
the	1
fishermen,	1
were	1
there	1
not	1
some	1
written	1
or	1
unwritten,	1
universal,	1
undisputed	1
law	1
applicable	1
to	1
all	1
cases.	1
Perhaps	1
the	1
only	1
formal	1
whaling	1
code	1
authorized	1
by	1
legislative	1
enactment,	1
was	1
that	1
of	1
Holland.	1
It	1
was	1
decreed	1
by	1
the	1
States-General	1
in	1
A.D.	1
1695.	1
But	1
though	1
no	1
other	1
nation	1
has	1
ever	1
had	1
any	1
written	1
whaling	1
law,	1
yet	1
the	1
American	1
fishermen	1
have	1
been	1
their	1
own	1
legislators	1
and	1
lawyers	1
in	1
this	1
matter.	1
They	1
have	1
provided	1
a	1
system	1
which	1
for	1
terse	1
comprehensiveness	1
surpasses	1
Justinian's	1
Pandects	1
and	1
the	1
By-laws	1
of	1
the	1
Chinese	1
Society	1
for	1
the	1
Suppression	1
of	1
Meddling	1
with	1
other	1
People's	1
Business.	1
Yes;	1
these	1
laws	1
might	1
be	1
engraven	1
on	1
a	1
Queen	1
Anne's	1
forthing,	1
or	1
the	1
barb	1
of	1
a	1
harpoon,	1
and	1
worn	1
round	1
the	1
neck,	1
so	1
small	1
are	1
they.	1
I.	1
A	1
Fast-Fish	1
belongs	1
to	1
the	1
party	1
fast	1
to	1
it.	1
II.	1
A	1
Loose-Fish	1
is	1
fair	1
game	1
for	1
anybody	1
who	1
can	1
soonest	1
catch	1
it.	1
But	1
what	1
plays	1
the	1
mischief	1
with	1
this	1
masterly	1
code	1
is	1
the	1
admirable	1
brevity	1
of	1
it,	1
which	1
necessitates	1
a	1
vast	1
volume	1
of	1
commentaries	1
to	1
expound	1
it.	1
First:	1
What	1
is	1
a	1
Fast-Fish?	1
Alive	1
or	1
dead	1
a	1
fish	1
is	1
technically	1
fast,	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
connected	1
with	1
an	1
occupied	1
ship	1
or	1
boat,	1
by	1
any	1
medium	1
at	1
all	1
controllable	1
by	1
the	1
occupant	1
or	1
occupants,--a	1
mast,	1
an	1
oar,	1
a	1
nine-inch	1
cable,	1
a	1
telegraph	1
wire,	1
or	1
a	1
strand	1
of	1
cobweb,	1
it	1
is	1
all	1
the	1
same.	1
Likewise	1
a	1
fish	1
is	1
technically	1
fast	1
when	1
it	1
bears	1
a	1
waif,	1
or	1
any	1
other	1
recognised	1
symbol	1
of	1
possession;	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
the	1
party	1
waifing	1
it	1
plainly	1
evince	1
their	1
ability	1
at	1
any	1
time	1
to	1
take	1
it	1
alongside,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
their	1
intention	1
so	1
to	1
do.	1
These	1
are	1
scientific	1
commentaries;	1
but	1
the	1
commentaries	1
of	1
the	1
whalemen	1
themselves	1
sometimes	1
consist	1
in	1
hard	1
words	1
and	1
harder	1
knocks--the	1
Coke-upon-Littleton	1
of	1
the	1
fist.	1
True,	1
among	1
the	1
more	1
upright	1
and	1
honourable	1
whalemen	1
allowances	1
are	1
always	1
made	1
for	1
peculiar	1
cases,	1
where	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
an	1
outrageous	1
moral	1
injustice	1
for	1
one	1
party	1
to	1
claim	1
possession	1
of	1
a	1
whale	1
previously	1
chased	1
or	1
killed	1
by	1
another	1
party.	1
But	1
others	1
are	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
so	1
scrupulous.	1
Some	1
fifty	1
years	1
ago	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
curious	1
case	1
of	1
whale-trover	1
litigated	1
in	1
England,	1
wherein	1
the	1
plaintiffs	1
set	1
forth	1
that	1
after	1
a	1
hard	1
chase	1
of	1
a	1
whale	1
in	1
the	1
Northern	1
seas;	1
and	1
when	1
indeed	1
they	1
(the	1
plaintiffs)	1
had	1
succeeded	1
in	1
harpooning	1
the	1
fish;	1
they	1
were	1
at	1
last,	1
through	1
peril	1
of	1
their	1
lives,	1
obliged	1
to	1
forsake	1
not	1
only	1
their	1
lines,	1
but	1
their	1
boat	1
itself.	1
Ultimately	1
the	1
defendants	1
(the	1
crew	1
of	1
another	1
ship)	1
came	1
up	1
with	1
the	1
whale,	1
struck,	1
killed,	1
seized,	1
and	1
finally	1
appropriated	1
it	1
before	1
the	1
very	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
plaintiffs.	1
And	1
when	1
those	1
defendants	1
were	1
remonstrated	1
with,	1
their	1
captain	1
snapped	1
his	1
fingers	1
in	1
the	1
plaintiffs'	1
teeth,	1
and	1
assured	1
them	1
that	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
doxology	1
to	1
the	1
deed	1
he	1
had	1
done,	1
he	1
would	1
now	1
retain	1
their	1
line,	1
harpoons,	1
and	1
boat,	1
which	1
had	1
remained	1
attached	1
to	1
the	1
whale	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
seizure.	1
Wherefore	1
the	1
plaintiffs	1
now	1
sued	1
for	1
the	1
recovery	1
of	1
the	1
value	1
of	1
their	1
whale,	1
line,	1
harpoons,	1
and	1
boat.	1
Mr.	1
Erskine	1
was	1
counsel	1
for	1
the	1
defendants;	1
Lord	1
Ellenborough	1
was	1
the	1
judge.	1
In	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
the	1
defence,	1
the	1
witty	1
Erskine	1
went	1
on	1
to	1
illustrate	1
his	1
position,	1
by	1
alluding	1
to	1
a	1
recent	1
crim.	1
con.	1
case,	1
wherein	1
a	1
gentleman,	1
after	1
in	1
vain	1
trying	1
to	1
bridle	1
his	1
wife's	1
viciousness,	1
had	1
at	1
last	1
abandoned	1
her	1
upon	1
the	1
seas	1
of	1
life;	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
years,	1
repenting	1
of	1
that	1
step,	1
he	1
instituted	1
an	1
action	1
to	1
recover	1
possession	1
of	1
her.	1
Erskine	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side;	1
and	1
he	1
then	1
supported	1
it	1
by	1
saying,	1
that	1
though	1
the	1
gentleman	1
had	1
originally	1
harpooned	1
the	1
lady,	1
and	1
had	1
once	1
had	1
her	1
fast,	1
and	1
only	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
stress	1
of	1
her	1
plunging	1
viciousness,	1
had	1
at	1
last	1
abandoned	1
her;	1
yet	1
abandon	1
her	1
he	1
did,	1
so	1
that	1
she	1
became	1
a	1
loose-fish;	1
and	1
therefore	1
when	1
a	1
subsequent	1
gentleman	1
re-harpooned	1
her,	1
the	1
lady	1
then	1
became	1
that	1
subsequent	1
gentleman's	1
property,	1
along	1
with	1
whatever	1
harpoon	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
found	1
sticking	1
in	1
her.	1
Now	1
in	1
the	1
present	1
case	1
Erskine	1
contended	1
that	1
the	1
examples	1
of	1
the	1
whale	1
and	1
the	1
lady	1
were	1
reciprocally	1
illustrative	1
of	1
each	1
other.	1
These	1
pleadings,	1
and	1
the	1
counter	1
pleadings,	1
being	1
duly	1
heard,	1
the	1
very	1
learned	1
Judge	1
in	1
set	1
terms	1
decided,	1
to	1
wit,--That	1
as	1
for	1
the	1
boat,	1
he	1
awarded	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
plaintiffs,	1
because	1
they	1
had	1
merely	1
abandoned	1
it	1
to	1
save	1
their	1
lives;	1
but	1
that	1
with	1
regard	1
to	1
the	1
controverted	1
whale,	1
harpoons,	1
and	1
line,	1
they	1
belonged	1
to	1
the	1
defendants;	1
the	1
whale,	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
Loose-Fish	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
final	1
capture;	1
and	1
the	1
harpoons	1
and	1
line	1
because	1
when	1
the	1
fish	1
made	1
off	1
with	1
them,	1
it	1
(the	1
fish)	1
acquired	1
a	1
property	1
in	1
those	1
articles;	1
and	1
hence	1
anybody	1
who	1
afterwards	1
took	1
the	1
fish	1
had	1
a	1
right	1
to	1
them.	1
Now	1
the	1
defendants	1
afterwards	1
took	1
the	1
fish;	1
ergo,	1
the	1
aforesaid	1
articles	1
were	1
theirs.	1
A	1
common	1
man	1
looking	1
at	1
this	1
decision	1
of	1
the	1
very	1
learned	1
Judge,	1
might	1
possibly	1
object	1
to	1
it.	1
But	1
ploughed	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
primary	1
rock	1
of	1
the	1
matter,	1
the	1
two	1
great	1
principles	1
laid	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
twin	1
whaling	1
laws	1
previously	1
quoted,	1
and	1
applied	1
and	1
elucidated	1
by	1
Lord	1
Ellenborough	1
in	1
the	1
above	1
cited	1
case;	1
these	1
two	1
laws	1
touching	1
Fast-Fish	1
and	1
Loose-Fish,	1
I	1
say,	1
will,	1
on	1
reflection,	1
be	1
found	1
the	1
fundamentals	1
of	1
all	1
human	1
jurisprudence;	1
for	1
notwithstanding	1
its	1
complicated	1
tracery	1
of	1
sculpture,	1
the	1
Temple	1
of	1
the	1
Law,	1
like	1
the	1
Temple	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
has	1
but	1
two	1
props	1
to	1
stand	1
on.	1
Is	1
it	1
not	1
a	1
saying	1
in	1
every	1
one's	1
mouth,	1
Possession	1
is	1
half	1
of	1
the	1
law:	1
that	1
is,	1
regardless	1
of	1
how	1
the	1
thing	1
came	1
into	1
possession?	1
But	1
often	1
possession	1
is	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
the	1
law.	1
What	1
are	1
the	1
sinews	1
and	1
souls	1
of	1
Russian	1
serfs	1
and	1
Republican	1
slaves	1
but	1
Fast-Fish,	1
whereof	1
possession	1
is	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
the	1
law?	1
What	1
to	1
the	1
rapacious	1
landlord	1
is	1
the	1
widow's	1
last	1
mite	1
but	1
a	1
Fast-Fish?	1
What	1
is	1
yonder	1
undetected	1
villain's	1
marble	1
mansion	1
with	1
a	1
door-plate	1
for	1
a	1
waif;	1
what	1
is	1
that	1
but	1
a	1
Fast-Fish?	1
What	1
is	1
the	1
ruinous	1
discount	1
which	1
Mordecai,	1
the	1
broker,	1
gets	1
from	1
poor	1
Woebegone,	1
the	1
bankrupt,	1
on	1
a	1
loan	1
to	1
keep	1
Woebegone's	1
family	1
from	1
starvation;	1
what	1
is	1
that	1
ruinous	1
discount	1
but	1
a	1
Fast-Fish?	1
What	1
is	1
the	1
Archbishop	1
of	1
Savesoul's	1
income	1
of	1
L100,000	1
seized	1
from	1
the	1
scant	1
bread	1
and	1
cheese	1
of	1
hundreds	1
of	1
thousands	1
of	1
broken-backed	1
laborers	1
(all	1
sure	1
of	1
heaven	1
without	1
any	1
of	1
Savesoul's	1
help)	1
what	1
is	1
that	1
globular	1
L100,000	1
but	1
a	1
Fast-Fish?	1
What	1
are	1
the	1
Duke	1
of	1
Dunder's	1
hereditary	1
towns	1
and	1
hamlets	1
but	1
Fast-Fish?	1
What	1
to	1
that	1
redoubted	1
harpooneer,	1
John	1
Bull,	1
is	1
poor	1
Ireland,	1
but	1
a	1
Fast-Fish?	1
What	1
to	1
that	1
apostolic	1
lancer,	1
Brother	1
Jonathan,	1
is	1
Texas	1
but	1
a	1
Fast-Fish?	1
And	1
concerning	1
all	1
these,	1
is	1
not	1
Possession	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
the	1
law?	1
But	1
if	1
the	1
doctrine	1
of	1
Fast-Fish	1
be	1
pretty	1
generally	1
applicable,	1
the	1
kindred	1
doctrine	1
of	1
Loose-Fish	1
is	1
still	1
more	1
widely	1
so.	1
That	1
is	1
internationally	1
and	1
universally	1
applicable.	1
What	1
was	1
America	1
in	1
1492	1
but	1
a	1
Loose-Fish,	1
in	1
which	1
Columbus	1
struck	1
the	1
Spanish	1
standard	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
waifing	1
it	1
for	1
his	1
royal	1
master	1
and	1
mistress?	1
What	1
was	1
Poland	1
to	1
the	1
Czar?	1
What	1
Greece	1
to	1
the	1
Turk?	1
What	1
India	1
to	1
England?	1
What	1
at	1
last	1
will	1
Mexico	1
be	1
to	1
the	1
United	1

All	1
Loose-Fish.	1
What	1
are	1
the	1
Rights	1
of	1
Man	1
and	1
the	1
Liberties	1
of	1
the	1

but	1
Loose-Fish?	1
What	1
all	1
men's	1
minds	1
and	1

but	1
Loose-Fish?	1
What	1
is	1
the	1
principle	1
of	1

in	1
them	1

Loose-Fish?	1
What	1
to	1
the	1
ostentatious	1

are	1

What	1

And	1

CHAPTER	1
90	1
Heads	1
or	1
Tails.	1
"De	1
balena	1
vero	1
sufficit,	1
si	1
rex	1
habeat	1
caput,	1
et	1
regina	1
caudam."	1
BRACTON,	1
L.	1
3,	1
C.	1
3.	1
Latin	1
from	1
the	1
books	1
of	1
the	1
Laws	1
of	1
England,	1
which	1
taken	1
along	1
with	1
the	1
context,	1
means,	1
that	1
of	1
all	1
whales	1
captured	1
by	1
anybody	1
on	1
the	1
coast	1
of	1
that	1
land,	1
the	1
King,	1
as	1
Honourary	1
Grand	1
Harpooneer,	1
must	1
have	1
the	1
head,	1
and	1
the	1
Queen	1
be	1
respectfully	1
presented	1
with	1
the	1
tail.	1
A	1
division	1
which,	1
in	1
the	1
whale,	1
is	1
much	1
like	1
halving	1
an	1
apple;	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
intermediate	1
remainder.	1
Now	1
as	1
this	1
law,	1
under	1
a	1
modified	1
form,	1
is	1
to	1
this	1
day	1
in	1
force	1
in	1
England;	1
and	1
as	1
it	1
offers	1
in	1
various	1
respects	1
a	1
strange	1
anomaly	1
touching	1
the	1
general	1
law	1
of	1
Fast	1
and	1
Loose-Fish,	1
it	1
is	1
here	1
treated	1
of	1
in	1
a	1
separate	1
chapter,	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
courteous	1
principle	1
that	1
prompts	1
the	1
English	1
railways	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
the	1
expense	1
of	1
a	1
separate	1
car,	1
specially	1
reserved	1
for	1
the	1
accommodation	1
of	1
royalty.	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
place,	1
in	1
curious	1
proof	1
of	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
above-mentioned	1
law	1
is	1
still	1
in	1
force,	1
I	1
proceed	1
to	1
lay	1
before	1
you	1
a	1
circumstance	1
that	1
happened	1
within	1
the	1
last	1
two	1
years.	1
It	1
seems	1
that	1
some	1
honest	1
mariners	1
of	1
Dover,	1
or	1
Sandwich,	1
or	1
some	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
Cinque	1
Ports,	1
had	1
after	1
a	1
hard	1
chase	1
succeeded	1
in	1
killing	1
and	1
beaching	1
a	1
fine	1
whale	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
originally	1
descried	1
afar	1
off	1
from	1
the	1
shore.	1
Now	1
the	1
Cinque	1
Ports	1
are	1
partially	1
or	1
somehow	1
under	1
the	1
jurisdiction	1
of	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
policeman	1
or	1
beadle,	1
called	1
a	1
Lord	1
Warden.	1
Holding	1
the	1
office	1
directly	1
from	1
the	1
crown,	1
I	1
believe,	1
all	1
the	1
royal	1
emoluments	1
incident	1
to	1
the	1
Cinque	1
Port	1
territories	1
become	1
by	1
assignment	1
his.	1
By	1
some	1
writers	1
this	1
office	1
is	1
called	1
a	1
sinecure.	1
But	1
not	1
so.	1
Because	1
the	1
Lord	1
Warden	1
is	1
busily	1
employed	1
at	1
times	1
in	1
fobbing	1
his	1
perquisites;	1
which	1
are	1
his	1
chiefly	1
by	1
virtue	1
of	1
that	1
same	1
fobbing	1
of	1
them.	1
Now	1
when	1
these	1
poor	1
sun-burnt	1
mariners,	1
bare-footed,	1
and	1
with	1
their	1
trowsers	1
rolled	1
high	1
up	1
on	1
their	1
eely	1
legs,	1
had	1
wearily	1
hauled	1
their	1
fat	1
fish	1
high	1
and	1
dry,	1
promising	1
themselves	1
a	1
good	1
L150	1
from	1
the	1
precious	1
oil	1
and	1
bone;	1
and	1
in	1
fantasy	1
sipping	1
rare	1
tea	1
with	1
their	1
wives,	1
and	1
good	1
ale	1
with	1
their	1
cronies,	1
upon	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
their	1
respective	1
shares;	1
up	1
steps	1
a	1
very	1
learned	1
and	1
most	1
Christian	1
and	1
charitable	1
gentleman,	1
with	1
a	1
copy	1
of	1
Blackstone	1
under	1
his	1
arm;	1
and	1
laying	1
it	1
upon	1
the	1
whale's	1
head,	1
he	1
says--"Hands	1
off!	1
this	1
fish,	1
my	1
masters,	1
is	1
a	1
Fast-Fish.	1
I	1
seize	1
it	1
as	1
the	1
Lord	1
Warden's."	1
Upon	1
this	1
the	1
poor	1
mariners	1
in	1
their	1
respectful	1
consternation--so	1
truly	1
English--knowing	1
not	1
what	1
to	1
say,	1
fall	1
to	1
vigorously	1
scratching	1
their	1
heads	1
all	1
round;	1
meanwhile	1
ruefully	1
glancing	1
from	1
the	1
whale	1
to	1
the	1
stranger.	1
But	1
that	1
did	1
in	1
nowise	1
mend	1
the	1
matter,	1
or	1
at	1
all	1
soften	1
the	1
hard	1
heart	1
of	1
the	1
learned	1
gentleman	1
with	1
the	1
copy	1
of	1
Blackstone.	1
At	1
length	1
one	1
of	1
them,	1
after	1
long	1
scratching	1
about	1
for	1
his	1
ideas,	1
made	1
bold	1
to	1
speak,	1
"Please,	1
sir,	1
who	1
is	1
the	1
Lord	1
Warden?"	1
"The	1
Duke."	1
"But	1
the	1
duke	1
had	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
taking	1
this	1
fish?"	1
"It	1
is	1
his."	1
"We	1
have	1
been	1
at	1
great	1
trouble,	1
and	1
peril,	1
and	1
some	1
expense,	1
and	1
is	1
all	1
that	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
Duke's	1
benefit;	1
we	1
getting	1
nothing	1
at	1
all	1
for	1
our	1
pains	1
but	1
our	1
blisters?"	1
"It	1
is	1
his."	1
"Is	1
the	1
Duke	1
so	1
very	1
poor	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
forced	1
to	1
this	1
desperate	1
mode	1
of	1
getting	1
a	1
livelihood?"	1
"It	1
is	1
his."	1
"I	1
thought	1
to	1
relieve	1
my	1
old	1
bed-ridden	1
mother	1
by	1
part	1
of	1
my	1
share	1
of	1
this	1
whale."	1
"It	1
is	1
his."	1
"Won't	1
the	1
Duke	1
be	1
content	1
with	1
a	1
quarter	1
or	1
a	1
half?"	1
"It	1
is	1
his."	1
In	1
a	1
word,	1
the	1
whale	1
was	1
seized	1
and	1
sold,	1
and	1
his	1
Grace	1
the	1
Duke	1
of	1
Wellington	1
received	1
the	1
money.	1
Thinking	1
that	1
viewed	1
in	1
some	1
particular	1
lights,	1
the	1
case	1
might	1
by	1
a	1
bare	1
possibility	1
in	1
some	1
small	1
degree	1
be	1
deemed,	1
under	1
the	1
circumstances,	1
a	1
rather	1
hard	1
one,	1
an	1
honest	1
clergyman	1
of	1
the	1
town	1
respectfully	1
addressed	1
a	1
note	1
to	1
his	1
Grace,	1
begging	1
him	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
those	1
unfortunate	1
mariners	1
into	1
full	1
consideration.	1
To	1
which	1
my	1
Lord	1
Duke	1
in	1
substance	1
replied	1
(both	1
letters	1
were	1
published)	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
done	1
so,	1
and	1
received	1
the	1
money,	1
and	1
would	1
be	1
obliged	1
to	1
the	1
reverend	1
gentleman	1
if	1
for	1
the	1
future	1
he	1
(the	1
reverend	1
gentleman)	1
would	1
decline	1
meddling	1
with	1
other	1
people's	1
business.	1
Is	1
this	1
the	1
still	1
militant	1
old	1
man,	1
standing	1
at	1
the	1
corners	1
of	1
the	1
three	1
kingdoms,	1
on	1
all	1
hands	1
coercing	1
alms	1
of	1
beggars?	1
It	1
will	1
readily	1
be	1
seen	1
that	1
in	1
this	1
case	1
the	1
alleged	1
right	1
of	1
the	1
Duke	1
to	1
the	1
whale	1
was	1
a	1
delegated	1
one	1
from	1
the	1
Sovereign.	1
We	1
must	1
needs	1
inquire	1
then	1
on	1
what	1
principle	1
the	1
Sovereign	1
is	1
originally	1
invested	1
with	1
that	1
right.	1
The	1
law	1
itself	1
has	1
already	1
been	1
set	1
forth.	1
But	1
Plowdon	1
gives	1
us	1
the	1
reason	1
for	1
it.	1
Says	1
Plowdon,	1
the	1
whale	1
so	1
caught	1
belongs	1
to	1
the	1
King	1
and	1
Queen,	1
"because	1
of	1
its	1
superior	1
excellence."	1
And	1
by	1
the	1
soundest	1
commentators	1
this	1
has	1
ever	1
been	1
held	1
a	1
cogent	1
argument	1
in	1
such	1
matters.	1
But	1
why	1
should	1
the	1
King	1
have	1
the	1
head,	1
and	1
the	1
Queen	1
the	1
tail?	1
A	1
reason	1
for	1
that,	1
ye	1
lawyers!	1
In	1
his	1
treatise	1
on	1
"Queen-Gold,"	1
or	1
Queen-pinmoney,	1
an	1
old	1
King's	1
Bench	1
author,	1
one	1
William	1
Prynne,	1
thus	1
discourseth:	1
"Ye	1
tail	1
is	1
ye	1
Queen's,	1
that	1
ye	1
Queen's	1
wardrobe	1
may	1
be	1
supplied	1
with	1
ye	1
whalebone."	1
Now	1
this	1
was	1
written	1
at	1
a	1
time	1
when	1
the	1
black	1
limber	1
bone	1
of	1
the	1
Greenland	1
or	1
Right	1
whale	1
was	1
largely	1
used	1
in	1
ladies'	1
bodices.	1
But	1
this	1
same	1
bone	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
tail;	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
head,	1
which	1
is	1
a	1
sad	1
mistake	1
for	1
a	1
sagacious	1
lawyer	1
like	1
Prynne.	1
But	1
is	1
the	1
Queen	1
a	1
mermaid,	1
to	1
be	1
presented	1
with	1
a	1
tail?	1
An	1
allegorical	1
meaning	1
may	1
lurk	1
here.	1
There	1
are	1
two	1
royal	1
fish	1
so	1
styled	1
by	1
the	1
English	1
law	1
writers--the	1
whale	1
and	1
the	1
sturgeon;	1
both	1
royal	1
property	1
under	1
certain	1
limitations,	1
and	1
nominally	1
supplying	1
the	1
tenth	1
branch	1
of	1
the	1
crown's	1
ordinary	1
revenue.	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
that	1
any	1
other	1
author	1
has	1
hinted	1
of	1
the	1
matter;	1
but	1
by	1
inference	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
the	1
sturgeon	1
must	1
be	1
divided	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
as	1
the	1
whale,	1
the	1
King	1
receiving	1
the	1
highly	1
dense	1
and	1
elastic	1
head	1
peculiar	1
to	1
that	1
fish,	1
which,	1
symbolically	1
regarded,	1
may	1
possibly	1
be	1
humorously	1
grounded	1
upon	1
some	1
presumed	1
congeniality.	1
And	1
thus	1
there	1
seems	1
a	1
reason	1
in	1
all	1
things,	1
even	1
in	1
law.	1
CHAPTER	1
91	1
The	1
Pequod	1
Meets	1
The	1
Rose-Bud.	1
"In	1
vain	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
rake	1
for	1
Ambergriese	1
in	1
the	1
paunch	1
of	1
this	1
Leviathan,	1
insufferable	1
fetor	1
denying	1
not	1
inquiry."	1
SIR	1
T.	1
BROWNE,	1
V.E.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
week	1
or	1
two	1
after	1
the	1
last	1
whaling	1
scene	1
recounted,	1
and	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
slowly	1
sailing	1
over	1
a	1
sleepy,	1
vapoury,	1
mid-day	1
sea,	1
that	1
the	1
many	1
noses	1
on	1
the	1
Pequod's	1
deck	1
proved	1
more	1
vigilant	1
discoverers	1
than	1
the	1
three	1
pairs	1
of	1
eyes	1
aloft.	1
A	1
peculiar	1
and	1
not	1
very	1
pleasant	1
smell	1
was	1
smelt	1
in	1
the	1
sea.	1
"I	1
will	1
bet	1
something	1
now,"	1
said	1
Stubb,	1
"that	1
somewhere	1
hereabouts	1
are	1
some	1
of	1
those	1
drugged	1
whales	1
we	1
tickled	1
the	1
other	1
day.	1
I	1
thought	1
they	1
would	1
keel	1
up	1
before	1
long."	1
Presently,	1
the	1
vapours	1
in	1
advance	1
slid	1
aside;	1
and	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
distance	1
lay	1
a	1
ship,	1
whose	1
furled	1
sails	1
betokened	1
that	1
some	1
sort	1
of	1
whale	1
must	1
be	1
alongside.	1
As	1
we	1
glided	1
nearer,	1
the	1
stranger	1
showed	1
French	1
colours	1
from	1
his	1
peak;	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
eddying	1
cloud	1
of	1
vulture	1
sea-fowl	1
that	1
circled,	1
and	1
hovered,	1
and	1
swooped	1
around	1
him,	1
it	1
was	1
plain	1
that	1
the	1
whale	1
alongside	1
must	1
be	1
what	1
the	1
fishermen	1
call	1
a	1
blasted	1
whale,	1
that	1
is,	1
a	1
whale	1
that	1
has	1
died	1
unmolested	1
on	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
so	1
floated	1
an	1
unappropriated	1
corpse.	1
It	1
may	1
well	1
be	1
conceived,	1
what	1
an	1
unsavory	1
odor	1
such	1
a	1
mass	1
must	1
exhale;	1
worse	1
than	1
an	1
Assyrian	1
city	1
in	1
the	1
plague,	1
when	1
the	1
living	1
are	1
incompetent	1
to	1
bury	1
the	1
departed.	1
So	1
intolerable	1
indeed	1
is	1
it	1
regarded	1
by	1
some,	1
that	1
no	1
cupidity	1
could	1
persuade	1
them	1
to	1
moor	1
alongside	1
of	1
it.	1
Yet	1
are	1
there	1
those	1
who	1
will	1
still	1
do	1
it;	1
notwithstanding	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
oil	1
obtained	1
from	1
such	1
subjects	1
is	1
of	1
a	1
very	1
inferior	1
quality,	1
and	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
of	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
attar-of-rose.	1
Coming	1
still	1
nearer	1
with	1
the	1
expiring	1
breeze,	1
we	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
Frenchman	1
had	1
a	1
second	1
whale	1
alongside;	1
and	1
this	1
second	1
whale	1
seemed	1
even	1
more	1
of	1
a	1
nosegay	1
than	1
the	1
first.	1
In	1
truth,	1
it	1
turned	1
out	1
to	1
be	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
problematical	1
whales	1
that	1
seem	1
to	1
dry	1
up	1
and	1
die	1
with	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
prodigious	1
dyspepsia,	1
or	1
indigestion;	1
leaving	1
their	1
defunct	1
bodies	1
almost	1
entirely	1
bankrupt	1
of	1
anything	1
like	1
oil.	1
Nevertheless,	1
in	1
the	1
proper	1
place	1
we	1
shall	1
see	1
that	1
no	1
knowing	1
fisherman	1
will	1
ever	1
turn	1
up	1
his	1
nose	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
whale	1
as	1
this,	1
however	1
much	1
he	1
may	1
shun	1
blasted	1
whales	1
in	1
general.	1
The	1
Pequod	1
had	1
now	1
swept	1
so	1
nigh	1
to	1
the	1
stranger,	1
that	1
Stubb	1
vowed	1
he	1
recognised	1
his	1
cutting	1
spade-pole	1
entangled	1
in	1
the	1
lines	1
that	1
were	1
knotted	1
round	1
the	1
tail	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
whales.	1
"There's	1
a	1
pretty	1
fellow,	1
now,"	1
he	1
banteringly	1
laughed,	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
ship's	1
bows,	1
"there's	1
a	1
jackal	1
for	1
ye!	1
I	1
well	1
know	1
that	1
these	1
Crappoes	1
of	1
Frenchmen	1
are	1
but	1
poor	1
devils	1
in	1
the	1
fishery;	1
sometimes	1
lowering	1
their	1
boats	1
for	1
breakers,	1
mistaking	1
them	1
for	1
Sperm	1
Whale	1
spouts;	1
yes,	1
and	1
sometimes	1
sailing	1
from	1
their	1
port	1
with	1
their	1
hold	1
full	1
of	1
boxes	1
of	1
tallow	1
candles,	1
and	1
cases	1
of	1
snuffers,	1
foreseeing	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
oil	1
they	1
will	1
get	1
won't	1
be	1
enough	1
to	1
dip	1
the	1
Captain's	1
wick	1
into;	1
aye,	1
we	1
all	1
know	1
these	1
things;	1
but	1
look	1
ye,	1
here's	1
a	1
Crappo	1
that	1
is	1
content	1
with	1
our	1
leavings,	1
the	1
drugged	1
whale	1
there,	1
I	1
mean;	1
aye,	1
and	1
is	1
content	1
too	1
with	1
scraping	1
the	1
dry	1
bones	1
of	1
that	1
other	1
precious	1
fish	1
he	1
has	1
there.	1
Poor	1
devil!	1
I	1
say,	1
pass	1
round	1
a	1
hat,	1
some	1
one,	1
and	1
let's	1
make	1
him	1
a	1
present	1
of	1
a	1
little	1
oil	1
for	1
dear	1
charity's	1
sake.	1
For	1
what	1
oil	1
he'll	1
get	1
from	1
that	1
drugged	1
whale	1
there,	1
wouldn't	1
be	1
fit	1
to	1
burn	1
in	1
a	1
jail;	1
no,	1
not	1
in	1
a	1
condemned	1
cell.	1
And	1
as	1
for	1
the	1
other	1
whale,	1
why,	1
I'll	1
agree	1
to	1
get	1
more	1
oil	1
by	1
chopping	1
up	1
and	1
trying	1
out	1
these	1
three	1
masts	1
of	1
ours,	1
than	1
he'll	1
get	1
from	1
that	1
bundle	1
of	1
bones;	1
though,	1
now	1
that	1
I	1
think	1
of	1
it,	1
it	1
may	1
contain	1
something	1
worth	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
more	1
than	1
oil;	1
yes,	1
ambergris.	1
I	1
wonder	1
now	1
if	1
our	1
old	1
man	1
has	1
thought	1
of	1
that.	1
It's	1
worth	1
trying.	1
Yes,	1
I'm	1
for	1
it;"	1
and	1
so	1
saying	1
he	1
started	1
for	1
the	1
quarter-deck.	1
By	1
this	1
time	1
the	1
faint	1
air	1
had	1
become	1
a	1
complete	1
calm;	1
so	1
that	1
whether	1
or	1
no,	1
the	1
Pequod	1
was	1
now	1
fairly	1
entrapped	1
in	1
the	1
smell,	1
with	1
no	1
hope	1
of	1
escaping	1
except	1
by	1
its	1
breezing	1
up	1
again.	1
Issuing	1
from	1
the	1
cabin,	1
Stubb	1
now	1
called	1
his	1
boat's	1
crew,	1
and	1
pulled	1
off	1
for	1
the	1
stranger.	1
Drawing	1
across	1
her	1
bow,	1
he	1
perceived	1
that	1
in	1
accordance	1
with	1
the	1
fanciful	1
French	1
taste,	1
the	1
upper	1
part	1
of	1
her	1
stem-piece	1
was	1
carved	1
in	1
the	1
likeness	1
of	1
a	1
huge	1
drooping	1
stalk,	1
was	1
painted	1
green,	1
and	1
for	1
thorns	1
had	1
copper	1
spikes	1
projecting	1
from	1
it	1
here	1
and	1
there;	1
the	1
whole	1
terminating	1
in	1
a	1
symmetrical	1
folded	1
bulb	1
of	1
a	1
bright	1
red	1
colour.	1
Upon	1
her	1
head	1
boards,	1
in	1
large	1
gilt	1
letters,	1
he	1
read	1
"Bouton	1
de	1
Rose,"--Rose-button,	1
or	1
Rose-bud;	1
and	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
romantic	1
name	1
of	1
this	1
aromatic	1
ship.	1
Though	1
Stubb	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
the	1
BOUTON	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
inscription,	1
yet	1
the	1
word	1
ROSE,	1
and	1
the	1
bulbous	1
figure-head	1
put	1
together,	1
sufficiently	1
explained	1
the	1
whole	1
to	1
him.	1
"A	1
wooden	1
rose-bud,	1
eh?"	1
he	1
cried	1
with	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
his	1
nose,	1
"that	1
will	1
do	1
very	1
well;	1
but	1
how	1
like	1
all	1
creation	1
it	1
smells!"	1
Now	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
hold	1
direct	1
communication	1
with	1
the	1
people	1
on	1
deck,	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
pull	1
round	1
the	1
bows	1
to	1
the	1
starboard	1
side,	1
and	1
thus	1
come	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
blasted	1
whale;	1
and	1
so	1
talk	1
over	1
it.	1
Arrived	1
then	1
at	1
this	1
spot,	1
with	1
one	1
hand	1
still	1
to	1
his	1
nose,	1
he	1
bawled--"Bouton-de-Rose,	1
ahoy!	1
are	1
there	1
any	1
of	1
you	1
Bouton-de-Roses	1
that	1
speak	1
English?"	1
"Yes,"	1
rejoined	1
a	1
Guernsey-man	1
from	1
the	1
bulwarks,	1
who	1
turned	1
out	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
chief-mate.	1
"Well,	1
then,	1
my	1
Bouton-de-Rose-bud,	1
have	1
you	1
seen	1
the	1
White	1
Whale?"	1
"WHAT	1
whale?"	1
"The	1
WHITE	1
Whale--a	1
Sperm	1
Whale--Moby	1
Dick,	1
have	1
ye	1
seen	1
him?	1
"Never	1
heard	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
whale.	1
Cachalot	1
Blanche!	1
White	1
Whale--no."	1
"Very	1
good,	1
then;	1
good	1
bye	1
now,	1
and	1
I'll	1
call	1
again	1
in	1
a	1
minute."	1
Then	1
rapidly	1
pulling	1
back	1
towards	1
the	1
Pequod,	1
and	1
seeing	1
Ahab	1
leaning	1
over	1
the	1
quarter-deck	1
rail	1
awaiting	1
his	1
report,	1
he	1
moulded	1
his	1
two	1
hands	1
into	1
a	1
trumpet	1
and	1
shouted--"No,	1
Sir!	1
No!"	1
Upon	1
which	1
Ahab	1
retired,	1
and	1
Stubb	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
Frenchman.	1
He	1
now	1
perceived	1
that	1
the	1
Guernsey-man,	1
who	1
had	1
just	1
got	1
into	1
the	1
chains,	1
and	1
was	1
using	1
a	1
cutting-spade,	1
had	1
slung	1
his	1
nose	1
in	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
bag.	1
"What's	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
your	1
nose,	1
there?"	1
said	1
Stubb.	1
"Broke	1
it?"	1
"I	1
wish	1
it	1
was	1
broken,	1
or	1
that	1
I	1
didn't	1
have	1
any	1
nose	1
at	1
all!"	1
answered	1
the	1
Guernsey-man,	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
relish	1
the	1
job	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
very	1
much.	1
"But	1
what	1
are	1
you	1
holding	1
YOURS	1
for?"	1
"Oh,	1
nothing!	1
It's	1
a	1
wax	1
nose;	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
hold	1
it	1
on.	1
Fine	1
day,	1
ain't	1
it?	1
Air	1
rather	1
gardenny,	1
I	1
should	1
say;	1
throw	1
us	1
a	1
bunch	1
of	1
posies,	1
will	1
ye,	1
Bouton-de-Rose?"	1
"What	1
in	1
the	1
devil's	1
name	1
do	1
you	1
want	1
here?"	1
roared	1
the	1
Guernseyman,	1
flying	1
into	1
a	1
sudden	1
passion.	1
"Oh!	1
keep	1
cool--cool?	1
yes,	1
that's	1
the	1
word!	1
why	1
don't	1
you	1
pack	1
those	1
whales	1
in	1
ice	1
while	1
you're	1
working	1
at	1
'em?	1
But	1
joking	1
aside,	1
though;	1
do	1
you	1
know,	1
Rose-bud,	1
that	1
it's	1
all	1
nonsense	1
trying	1
to	1
get	1
any	1
oil	1
out	1
of	1
such	1
whales?	1
As	1
for	1
that	1
dried	1
up	1
one,	1
there,	1
he	1
hasn't	1
a	1
gill	1
in	1
his	1
whole	1
carcase."	1
"I	1
know	1
that	1
well	1
enough;	1
but,	1
d'ye	1
see,	1
the	1
Captain	1
here	1
won't	1
believe	1
it;	1
this	1
is	1
his	1
first	1
voyage;	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
Cologne	1
manufacturer	1
before.	1
But	1
come	1
aboard,	1
and	1
mayhap	1
he'll	1
believe	1
you,	1
if	1
he	1
won't	1
me;	1
and	1
so	1
I'll	1
get	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
dirty	1
scrape."	1
"Anything	1
to	1
oblige	1
ye,	1
my	1
sweet	1
and	1
pleasant	1
fellow,"	1
rejoined	1
Stubb,	1
and	1
with	1
that	1
he	1
soon	1
mounted	1
to	1
the	1
deck.	1
There	1
a	1
queer	1
scene	1
presented	1
itself.	1
The	1
sailors,	1
in	1
tasselled	1
caps	1
of	1
red	1
worsted,	1
were	1
getting	1
the	1
heavy	1
tackles	1
in	1
readiness	1
for	1
the	1
whales.	1
But	1
they	1
worked	1
rather	1
slow	1
and	1
talked	1
very	1
fast,	1
and	1
seemed	1
in	1
anything	1
but	1
a	1
good	1
humor.	1
All	1
their	1
noses	1
upwardly	1
projected	1
from	1
their	1
faces	1
like	1
so	1
many	1
jib-booms.	1
Now	1
and	1
then	1
pairs	1
of	1
them	1
would	1
drop	1
their	1
work,	1
and	1
run	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
mast-head	1
to	1
get	1
some	1
fresh	1
air.	1
Some	1
thinking	1
they	1
would	1
catch	1
the	1
plague,	1
dipped	1
oakum	1
in	1
coal-tar,	1
and	1
at	1
intervals	1
held	1
it	1
to	1
their	1
nostrils.	1
Others	1
having	1
broken	1
the	1
stems	1
of	1
their	1
pipes	1
almost	1
short	1
off	1
at	1
the	1
bowl,	1
were	1
vigorously	1
puffing	1
tobacco-smoke,	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
constantly	1
filled	1
their	1
olfactories.	1
Stubb	1
was	1
struck	1
by	1
a	1
shower	1
of	1
outcries	1
and	1
anathemas	1
proceeding	1
from	1
the	1
Captain's	1
round-house	1
abaft;	1
and	1
looking	1
in	1
that	1
direction	1
saw	1
a	1
fiery	1
face	1
thrust	1
from	1
behind	1
the	1
door,	1
which	1
was	1
held	1
ajar	1
from	1
within.	1
This	1
was	1
the	1
tormented	1
surgeon,	1
who,	1
after	1
in	1
vain	1
remonstrating	1
against	1
the	1
proceedings	1
of	1
the	1
day,	1
had	1
betaken	1
himself	1
to	1
the	1
Captain's	1
round-house	1
(CABINET	1
he	1
called	1
it)	1
to	1
avoid	1
the	1
pest;	1
but	1
still,	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
yelling	1
out	1
his	1
entreaties	1
and	1
indignations	1
at	1
times.	1
Marking	1
all	1
this,	1
Stubb	1
argued	1
well	1
for	1
his	1
scheme,	1
and	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
Guernsey-man	1
had	1
a	1
little	1
chat	1
with	1
him,	1
during	1
which	1
the	1
stranger	1
mate	1
expressed	1
his	1
detestation	1
of	1
his	1
Captain	1
as	1
a	1
conceited	1
ignoramus,	1
who	1
had	1
brought	1
them	1
all	1
into	1
so	1
unsavory	1
and	1
unprofitable	1
a	1
pickle.	1
Sounding	1
him	1
carefully,	1
Stubb	1
further	1
perceived	1
that	1
the	1
Guernsey-man	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
slightest	1
suspicion	1
concerning	1
the	1
ambergris.	1
He	1
therefore	1
held	1
his	1
peace	1
on	1
that	1
head,	1
but	1
otherwise	1
was	1
quite	1
frank	1
and	1
confidential	1
with	1
him,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
two	1
quickly	1
concocted	1
a	1
little	1
plan	1
for	1
both	1
circumventing	1
and	1
satirizing	1
the	1
Captain,	1
without	1
his	1
at	1
all	1
dreaming	1
of	1
distrusting	1
their	1
sincerity.	1
According	1
to	1
this	1
little	1
plan	1
of	1
theirs,	1
the	1
Guernsey-man,	1
under	1
cover	1
of	1
an	1
interpreter's	1
office,	1
was	1
to	1
tell	1
the	1
Captain	1
what	1
he	1
pleased,	1
but	1
as	1
coming	1
from	1
Stubb;	1
and	1
as	1
for	1
Stubb,	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
utter	1
any	1
nonsense	1
that	1
should	1
come	1
uppermost	1
in	1
him	1
during	1
the	1
interview.	1
By	1
this	1
time	1
their	1
destined	1
victim	1
appeared	1
from	1
his	1
cabin.	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
small	1
and	1
dark,	1
but	1
rather	1
delicate	1
looking	1
man	1
for	1
a	1
sea-captain,	1
with	1
large	1
whiskers	1
and	1
moustache,	1
however;	1
and	1
wore	1
a	1
red	1
cotton	1
velvet	1
vest	1
with	1
watch-seals	1
at	1
his	1
side.	1
To	1
this	1
gentleman,	1
Stubb	1
was	1
now	1
politely	1
introduced	1
by	1
the	1
Guernsey-man,	1
who	1
at	1
once	1
ostentatiously	1
put	1
on	1
the	1
aspect	1
of	1
interpreting	1
between	1
them.	1
"What	1
shall	1
I	1
say	1
to	1
him	1
first?"	1
said	1
he.	1
"Why,"	1
said	1
Stubb,	1
eyeing	1
the	1
velvet	1
vest	1
and	1
the	1
watch	1
and	1
seals,	1
"you	1
may	1
as	1
well	1
begin	1
by	1
telling	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
looks	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
babyish	1
to	1
me,	1
though	1
I	1
don't	1
pretend	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
judge."	1
"He	1
says,	1
Monsieur,"	1
said	1
the	1
Guernsey-man,	1
in	1
French,	1
turning	1
to	1
his	1
captain,	1
"that	1
only	1
yesterday	1
his	1
ship	1
spoke	1
a	1
vessel,	1
whose	1
captain	1
and	1
chief-mate,	1
with	1
six	1
sailors,	1
had	1
all	1
died	1
of	1
a	1
fever	1
caught	1
from	1
a	1
blasted	1
whale	1
they	1
had	1
brought	1
alongside."	1
Upon	1
this	1
the	1
captain	1
started,	1
and	1
eagerly	1
desired	1
to	1
know	1
more.	1
"What	1
now?"	1
said	1
the	1
Guernsey-man	1
to	1
Stubb.	1
"Why,	1
since	1
he	1
takes	1
it	1
so	1
easy,	1
tell	1
him	1
that	1
now	1
I	1
have	1
eyed	1
him	1
carefully,	1
I'm	1
quite	1
certain	1
that	1
he's	1
no	1
more	1
fit	1
to	1
command	1
a	1
whale-ship	1
than	1
a	1
St.	1
Jago	1
monkey.	1
In	1
fact,	1
tell	1
him	1
from	1
me	1
he's	1
a	1
baboon."	1
"He	1
vows	1
and	1
declares,	1
Monsieur,	1
that	1
the	1
other	1
whale,	1
the	1
dried	1
one,	1
is	1
far	1
more	1
deadly	1
than	1
the	1
blasted	1
one;	1
in	1
fine,	1
Monsieur,	1
he	1
conjures	1
us,	1
as	1
we	1
value	1
our	1
lives,	1
to	1
cut	1
loose	1
from	1
these	1
fish."	1
Instantly	1
the	1
captain	1
ran	1
forward,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
loud	1
voice	1
commanded	1
his	1
crew	1
to	1
desist	1
from	1
hoisting	1
the	1
cutting-tackles,	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
cast	1
loose	1
the	1
cables	1
and	1
chains	1
confining	1
the	1
whales	1
to	1
the	1
ship.	1
"What	1
now?"	1
said	1
the	1
Guernsey-man,	1
when	1
the	1
Captain	1
had	1
returned	1
to	1
them.	1
"Why,	1
let	1
me	1
see;	1
yes,	1
you	1
may	1
as	1
well	1
tell	1
him	1
now	1
that--that--in	1
fact,	1
tell	1
him	1
I've	1
diddled	1
him,	1
and	1
(aside	1
to	1
himself)	1
perhaps	1
somebody	1
else."	1
"He	1
says,	1
Monsieur,	1
that	1
he's	1
very	1
happy	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
of	1
any	1
service	1
to	1
us."	1
Hearing	1
this,	1
the	1
captain	1
vowed	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
the	1
grateful	1
parties	1
(meaning	1
himself	1
and	1
mate)	1
and	1
concluded	1
by	1
inviting	1
Stubb	1
down	1
into	1
his	1
cabin	1
to	1
drink	1
a	1
bottle	1
of	1
Bordeaux.	1
"He	1
wants	1
you	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
glass	1
of	1
wine	1
with	1
him,"	1
said	1
the	1
interpreter.	1
"Thank	1
him	1
heartily;	1
but	1
tell	1
him	1
it's	1
against	1
my	1
principles	1
to	1
drink	1
with	1
the	1
man	1
I've	1
diddled.	1
In	1
fact,	1
tell	1
him	1
I	1
must	1
go."	1
"He	1
says,	1
Monsieur,	1
that	1
his	1
principles	1
won't	1
admit	1
of	1
his	1
drinking;	1
but	1
that	1
if	1
Monsieur	1
wants	1
to	1
live	1
another	1
day	1
to	1
drink,	1
then	1
Monsieur	1
had	1
best	1
drop	1
all	1
four	1
boats,	1
and	1
pull	1
the	1
ship	1
away	1
from	1
these	1
whales,	1
for	1
it's	1
so	1
calm	1
they	1
won't	1
drift."	1
By	1
this	1
time	1
Stubb	1
was	1
over	1
the	1
side,	1
and	1
getting	1
into	1
his	1
boat,	1
hailed	1
the	1
Guernsey-man	1
to	1
this	1
effect,--that	1
having	1
a	1
long	1
tow-line	1
in	1
his	1
boat,	1
he	1
would	1
do	1
what	1
he	1
could	1
to	1
help	1
them,	1
by	1
pulling	1
out	1
the	1
lighter	1
whale	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
from	1
the	1
ship's	1
side.	1
While	1
the	1
Frenchman's	1
boats,	1
then,	1
were	1
engaged	1
in	1
towing	1
the	1
ship	1
one	1
way,	1
Stubb	1
benevolently	1
towed	1
away	1
at	1
his	1
whale	1
the	1
other	1
way,	1
ostentatiously	1
slacking	1
out	1
a	1
most	1
unusually	1
long	1
tow-line.	1
Presently	1
a	1
breeze	1
sprang	1
up;	1
Stubb	1
feigned	1
to	1
cast	1
off	1
from	1
the	1
whale;	1
hoisting	1
his	1
boats,	1
the	1
Frenchman	1
soon	1
increased	1
his	1
distance,	1
while	1
the	1
Pequod	1
slid	1
in	1
between	1
him	1
and	1
Stubb's	1
whale.	1
Whereupon	1
Stubb	1
quickly	1
pulled	1
to	1
the	1
floating	1
body,	1
and	1
hailing	1
the	1
Pequod	1
to	1
give	1
notice	1
of	1
his	1
intentions,	1
at	1
once	1
proceeded	1
to	1
reap	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
his	1
unrighteous	1
cunning.	1
Seizing	1
his	1
sharp	1
boat-spade,	1
he	1
commenced	1
an	1
excavation	1
in	1
the	1
body,	1
a	1
little	1
behind	1
the	1
side	1
fin.	1
You	1
would	1
almost	1
have	1
thought	1
he	1
was	1
digging	1
a	1
cellar	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
sea;	1
and	1
when	1
at	1
length	1
his	1
spade	1
struck	1
against	1
the	1
gaunt	1
ribs,	1
it	1
was	1
like	1
turning	1
up	1
old	1
Roman	1
tiles	1
and	1
pottery	1
buried	1
in	1
fat	1
English	1
loam.	1
His	1
boat's	1
crew	1
were	1
all	1
in	1
high	1
excitement,	1
eagerly	1
helping	1
their	1
chief,	1
and	1
looking	1
as	1
anxious	1
as	1
gold-hunters.	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
numberless	1
fowls	1
were	1
diving,	1
and	1
ducking,	1
and	1
screaming,	1
and	1
yelling,	1
and	1
fighting	1
around	1
them.	1
Stubb	1
was	1
beginning	1
to	1
look	1
disappointed,	1
especially	1
as	1
the	1
horrible	1
nosegay	1
increased,	1
when	1
suddenly	1
from	1
out	1
the	1
very	1
heart	1
of	1
this	1
plague,	1
there	1
stole	1
a	1
faint	1
stream	1
of	1
perfume,	1
which	1
flowed	1
through	1
the	1
tide	1
of	1
bad	1
smells	1
without	1
being	1
absorbed	1
by	1
it,	1
as	1
one	1
river	1
will	1
flow	1
into	1
and	1
then	1
along	1
with	1
another,	1
without	1
at	1
all	1
blending	1
with	1
it	1
for	1
a	1
time.	1
"I	1
have	1
it,	1
I	1
have	1
it,"	1
cried	1
Stubb,	1
with	1
delight,	1
striking	1
something	1
in	1
the	1
subterranean	1
regions,	1
"a	1
purse!	1
a	1
purse!"	1
Dropping	1
his	1
spade,	1
he	1
thrust	1
both	1
hands	1
in,	1
and	1
drew	1
out	1
handfuls	1
of	1
something	1
that	1
looked	1
like	1
ripe	1
Windsor	1
soap,	1
or	1
rich	1
mottled	1
old	1
cheese;	1
very	1
unctuous	1
and	1
savory	1
withal.	1
You	1
might	1
easily	1
dent	1
it	1
with	1
your	1
thumb;	1
it	1
is	1
of	1
a	1
hue	1
between	1
yellow	1
and	1
ash	1
colour.	1
And	1
this,	1
good	1
friends,	1
is	1
ambergris,	1
worth	1
a	1
gold	1
guinea	1
an	1
ounce	1
to	1
any	1
druggist.	1
Some	1
six	1
handfuls	1
were	1
obtained;	1
but	1
more	1
was	1
unavoidably	1
lost	1
in	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
still	1
more,	1
perhaps,	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
secured	1
were	1
it	1
not	1
for	1
impatient	1
Ahab's	1
loud	1
command	1
to	1
Stubb	1
to	1
desist,	1
and	1
come	1
on	1
board,	1
else	1
the	1
ship	1
would	1
bid	1
them	1
good	1
bye.	1
CHAPTER	1
92	1
Ambergris.	1
Now	1
this	1
ambergris	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
curious	1
substance,	1
and	1
so	1
important	1
as	1
an	1
article	1
of	1
commerce,	1
that	1
in	1
1791	1
a	1
certain	1
Nantucket-born	1
Captain	1
Coffin	1
was	1
examined	1
at	1
the	1
bar	1
of	1
the	1
English	1
House	1
of	1
Commons	1
on	1
that	1
subject.	1
For	1
at	1
that	1
time,	1
and	1
indeed	1
until	1
a	1
comparatively	1
late	1
day,	1
the	1
precise	1
origin	1
of	1
ambergris	1
remained,	1
like	1
amber	1
itself,	1
a	1
problem	1
to	1
the	1
learned.	1
Though	1
the	1
word	1
ambergris	1
is	1
but	1
the	1
French	1
compound	1
for	1
grey	1
amber,	1
yet	1
the	1
two	1
substances	1
are	1
quite	1
distinct.	1
For	1
amber,	1
though	1
at	1
times	1
found	1
on	1
the	1
sea-coast,	1
is	1
also	1
dug	1
up	1
in	1
some	1
far	1
inland	1
soils,	1
whereas	1
ambergris	1
is	1
never	1
found	1
except	1
upon	1
the	1
sea.	1
Besides,	1
amber	1
is	1
a	1
hard,	1
transparent,	1
brittle,	1
odorless	1
substance,	1
used	1
for	1
mouth-pieces	1
to	1
pipes,	1
for	1
beads	1
and	1
ornaments;	1
but	1
ambergris	1
is	1
soft,	1
waxy,	1
and	1
so	1
highly	1
fragrant	1
and	1
spicy,	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
largely	1
used	1
in	1
perfumery,	1
in	1
pastiles,	1
precious	1
candles,	1
hair-powders,	1
and	1
pomatum.	1
The	1
Turks	1
use	1
it	1
in	1
cooking,	1
and	1
also	1
carry	1
it	1
to	1
Mecca,	1
for	1
the	1
same	1
purpose	1
that	1
frankincense	1
is	1
carried	1
to	1
St.	1
Peter's	1
in	1
Rome.	1
Some	1
wine	1
merchants	1
drop	1
a	1
few	1
grains	1
into	1
claret,	1
to	1
flavor	1
it.	1
Who	1
would	1
think,	1
then,	1
that	1
such	1
fine	1
ladies	1
and	1
gentlemen	1
should	1
regale	1
themselves	1
with	1
an	1
essence	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
inglorious	1
bowels	1
of	1
a	1
sick	1
whale!	1
Yet	1
so	1
it	1
is.	1
By	1
some,	1
ambergris	1
is	1
supposed	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
cause,	1
and	1
by	1
others	1
the	1
effect,	1
of	1
the	1
dyspepsia	1
in	1
the	1
whale.	1
How	1
to	1
cure	1
such	1
a	1
dyspepsia	1
it	1
were	1
hard	1
to	1
say,	1
unless	1
by	1
administering	1
three	1
or	1
four	1
boat	1
loads	1
of	1
Brandreth's	1
pills,	1
and	1
then	1
running	1
out	1
of	1
harm's	1
way,	1
as	1
laborers	1
do	1
in	1
blasting	1
rocks.	1
I	1
have	1
forgotten	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
found	1
in	1
this	1
ambergris,	1
certain	1
hard,	1
round,	1
bony	1
plates,	1
which	1
at	1
first	1
Stubb	1
thought	1
might	1
be	1
sailors'	1
trowsers	1
buttons;	1
but	1
it	1
afterwards	1
turned	1
out	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
nothing	1
more	1
than	1
pieces	1
of	1
small	1
squid	1
bones	1
embalmed	1
in	1
that	1
manner.	1
Now	1
that	1
the	1
incorruption	1
of	1
this	1
most	1
fragrant	1
ambergris	1
should	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
such	1
decay;	1
is	1
this	1
nothing?	1
Bethink	1
thee	1
of	1
that	1
saying	1
of	1
St.	1
Paul	1
in	1
Corinthians,	1
about	1
corruption	1
and	1
incorruption;	1
how	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
sown	1
in	1
dishonour,	1
but	1
raised	1
in	1
glory.	1
And	1
likewise	1
call	1
to	1
mind	1
that	1
saying	1
of	1
Paracelsus	1
about	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
maketh	1
the	1
best	1
musk.	1
Also	1
forget	1
not	1
the	1
strange	1
fact	1
that	1
of	1
all	1
things	1
of	1
ill-savor,	1
Cologne-water,	1
in	1
its	1
rudimental	1
manufacturing	1
stages,	1
is	1
the	1
worst.	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
conclude	1
the	1
chapter	1
with	1
the	1
above	1
appeal,	1
but	1
cannot,	1
owing	1
to	1
my	1
anxiety	1
to	1
repel	1
a	1
charge	1
often	1
made	1
against	1
whalemen,	1
and	1
which,	1
in	1
the	1
estimation	1
of	1
some	1
already	1
biased	1
minds,	1
might	1
be	1
considered	1
as	1
indirectly	1
substantiated	1
by	1
what	1
has	1
been	1
said	1
of	1
the	1
Frenchman's	1
two	1
whales.	1
Elsewhere	1
in	1
this	1
volume	1
the	1
slanderous	1
aspersion	1
has	1
been	1
disproved,	1
that	1
the	1
vocation	1
of	1
whaling	1
is	1
throughout	1
a	1
slatternly,	1
untidy	1
business.	1
But	1
there	1
is	1
another	1
thing	1
to	1
rebut.	1
They	1
hint	1
that	1
all	1
whales	1
always	1
smell	1
bad.	1
Now	1
how	1
did	1
this	1
odious	1
stigma	1
originate?	1
I	1
opine,	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
plainly	1
traceable	1
to	1
the	1
first	1
arrival	1
of	1
the	1
Greenland	1
whaling	1
ships	1
in	1
London,	1
more	1
than	1
two	1
centuries	1
ago.	1
Because	1
those	1
whalemen	1
did	1
not	1
then,	1
and	1
do	1
not	1
now,	1
try	1
out	1
their	1
oil	1
at	1
sea	1
as	1
the	1
Southern	1
ships	1
have	1
always	1
done;	1
but	1
cutting	1
up	1
the	1
fresh	1
blubber	1
in	1
small	1
bits,	1
thrust	1
it	1
through	1
the	1
bung	1
holes	1
of	1
large	1
casks,	1
and	1
carry	1
it	1
home	1
in	1
that	1
manner;	1
the	1
shortness	1
of	1
the	1
season	1
in	1
those	1
Icy	1
Seas,	1
and	1
the	1
sudden	1
and	1
violent	1
storms	1
to	1
which	1
they	1
are	1
exposed,	1
forbidding	1
any	1
other	1
course.	1
The	1
consequence	1
is,	1
that	1
upon	1
breaking	1
into	1
the	1
hold,	1
and	1
unloading	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
whale	1
cemeteries,	1
in	1
the	1
Greenland	1
dock,	1
a	1
savor	1
is	1
given	1
forth	1
somewhat	1
similar	1
to	1
that	1
arising	1
from	1
excavating	1
an	1
old	1
city	1
grave-yard,	1
for	1
the	1
foundations	1
of	1
a	1
Lying-in-Hospital.	1
I	1
partly	1
surmise	1
also,	1
that	1
this	1
wicked	1
charge	1
against	1
whalers	1
may	1
be	1
likewise	1
imputed	1
to	1
the	1
existence	1
on	1
the	1
coast	1
of	1
Greenland,	1
in	1
former	1
times,	1
of	1
a	1
Dutch	1
village	1
called	1
Schmerenburgh	1
or	1
Smeerenberg,	1
which	1
latter	1
name	1
is	1
the	1
one	1
used	1
by	1
the	1
learned	1
Fogo	1
Von	1
Slack,	1
in	1
his	1
great	1
work	1
on	1
Smells,	1
a	1
text-book	1
on	1
that	1
subject.	1
As	1
its	1
name	1
imports	1
(smeer,	1
fat;	1
berg,	1
to	1
put	1
up),	1
this	1
village	1
was	1
founded	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
afford	1
a	1
place	1
for	1
the	1
blubber	1
of	1
the	1
Dutch	1
whale	1
fleet	1
to	1
be	1
tried	1
out,	1
without	1
being	1
taken	1
home	1
to	1
Holland	1
for	1
that	1
purpose.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
collection	1
of	1
furnaces,	1
fat-kettles,	1
and	1
oil	1
sheds;	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
works	1
were	1
in	1
full	1
operation	1
certainly	1
gave	1
forth	1
no	1
very	1
pleasant	1
savor.	1
But	1
all	1
this	1
is	1
quite	1
different	1
with	1
a	1
South	1
Sea	1
Sperm	1
Whaler;	1
which	1
in	1
a	1
voyage	1
of	1
four	1
years	1
perhaps,	1
after	1
completely	1
filling	1
her	1
hold	1
with	1
oil,	1
does	1
not,	1
perhaps,	1
consume	1
fifty	1
days	1
in	1
the	1
business	1
of	1
boiling	1
out;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
state	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
casked,	1
the	1
oil	1
is	1
nearly	1
scentless.	1
The	1
truth	1
is,	1
that	1
living	1
or	1
dead,	1
if	1
but	1
decently	1
treated,	1
whales	1
as	1
a	1
species	1
are	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
creatures	1
of	1
ill	1
odor;	1
nor	1
can	1
whalemen	1
be	1
recognised,	1
as	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
middle	1
ages	1
affected	1
to	1
detect	1
a	1
Jew	1
in	1
the	1
company,	1
by	1
the	1
nose.	1
Nor	1
indeed	1
can	1
the	1
whale	1
possibly	1
be	1
otherwise	1
than	1
fragrant,	1
when,	1
as	1
a	1
general	1
thing,	1
he	1
enjoys	1
such	1
high	1
health;	1
taking	1
abundance	1
of	1
exercise;	1
always	1
out	1
of	1
doors;	1
though,	1
it	1
is	1
true,	1
seldom	1
in	1
the	1
open	1
air.	1
I	1
say,	1
that	1
the	1
motion	1
of	1
a	1
Sperm	1
Whale's	1
flukes	1
above	1
water	1
dispenses	1
a	1
perfume,	1
as	1
when	1
a	1
musk-scented	1
lady	1
rustles	1
her	1
dress	1
in	1
a	1
warm	1
parlor.	1
What	1
then	1
shall	1
I	1
liken	1
the	1
Sperm	1
Whale	1
to	1
for	1
fragrance,	1
considering	1
his	1
magnitude?	1
Must	1
it	1
not	1
be	1
to	1
that	1
famous	1
elephant,	1
with	1
jewelled	1
tusks,	1
and	1
redolent	1
with	1
myrrh,	1
which	1
was	1
led	1
out	1
of	1
an	1
Indian	1
town	1
to	1
do	1
honour	1
to	1
Alexander	1
the	1
Great?	1
CHAPTER	1
93	1
The	1
Castaway.	1
It	1
was	1
but	1
some	1
few	1
days	1
after	1
encountering	1
the	1
Frenchman,	1
that	1
a	1
most	1
significant	1
event	1
befell	1
the	1
most	1
insignificant	1
of	1
the	1
Pequod's	1
crew;	1
an	1
event	1
most	1
lamentable;	1
and	1
which	1
ended	1
in	1
providing	1
the	1
sometimes	1
madly	1
merry	1
and	1
predestinated	1
craft	1
with	1
a	1
living	1
and	1
ever	1
accompanying	1
prophecy	1
of	1
whatever	1
shattered	1
sequel	1
might	1
prove	1
her	1
own.	1
Now,	1
in	1
the	1
whale	1
ship,	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
goes	1
in	1
the	1
boats.	1
Some	1
few	1
hands	1
are	1
reserved	1
called	1
ship-keepers,	1
whose	1
province	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
work	1
the	1
vessel	1
while	1
the	1
boats	1
are	1
pursuing	1
the	1
whale.	1
As	1
a	1
general	1
thing,	1
these	1
ship-keepers	1
are	1
as	1
hardy	1
fellows	1
as	1
the	1
men	1
comprising	1
the	1
boats'	1
crews.	1
But	1
if	1
there	1
happen	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
unduly	1
slender,	1
clumsy,	1
or	1
timorous	1
wight	1
in	1
the	1
ship,	1
that	1
wight	1
is	1
certain	1
to	1
be	1
made	1
a	1
ship-keeper.	1
It	1
was	1
so	1
in	1
the	1
Pequod	1
with	1
the	1
little	1
negro	1
Pippin	1
by	1
nick-name,	1
Pip	1
by	1
abbreviation.	1
Poor	1
Pip!	1
ye	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
him	1
before;	1
ye	1
must	1
remember	1
his	1
tambourine	1
on	1
that	1
dramatic	1
midnight,	1
so	1
gloomy-jolly.	1
In	1
outer	1
aspect,	1
Pip	1
and	1
Dough-Boy	1
made	1
a	1
match,	1
like	1
a	1
black	1
pony	1
and	1
a	1
white	1
one,	1
of	1
equal	1
developments,	1
though	1
of	1
dissimilar	1
colour,	1
driven	1
in	1
one	1
eccentric	1
span.	1
But	1
while	1
hapless	1
Dough-Boy	1
was	1
by	1
nature	1
dull	1
and	1
torpid	1
in	1
his	1
intellects,	1
Pip,	1
though	1
over	1
tender-hearted,	1
was	1
at	1
bottom	1
very	1
bright,	1
with	1
that	1
pleasant,	1
genial,	1
jolly	1
brightness	1
peculiar	1
to	1
his	1
tribe;	1
a	1
tribe,	1
which	1
ever	1
enjoy	1
all	1
holidays	1
and	1
festivities	1
with	1
finer,	1
freer	1
relish	1
than	1
any	1
other	1
race.	1
For	1
blacks,	1
the	1
year's	1
calendar	1
should	1
show	1
naught	1
but	1
three	1
hundred	1
and	1
sixty-five	1
Fourth	1
of	1
Julys	1
and	1
New	1
Year's	1
Days.	1
Nor	1
smile	1
so,	1
while	1
I	1
write	1
that	1
this	1
little	1
black	1
was	1
brilliant,	1
for	1
even	1
blackness	1
has	1
its	1
brilliancy;	1
behold	1
yon	1
lustrous	1
ebony,	1
panelled	1
in	1
king's	1
cabinets.	1
But	1
Pip	1
loved	1
life,	1
and	1
all	1
life's	1
peaceable	1
securities;	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
panic-striking	1
business	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
somehow	1
unaccountably	1
become	1
entrapped,	1
had	1
most	1
sadly	1
blurred	1
his	1
brightness;	1
though,	1
as	1
ere	1
long	1
will	1
be	1
seen,	1
what	1
was	1
thus	1
temporarily	1
subdued	1
in	1
him,	1
in	1
the	1
end	1
was	1
destined	1
to	1
be	1
luridly	1
illumined	1
by	1
strange	1
wild	1
fires,	1
that	1
fictitiously	1
showed	1
him	1
off	1
to	1
ten	1
times	1
the	1
natural	1
lustre	1
with	1
which	1
in	1
his	1
native	1
Tolland	1
County	1
in	1
Connecticut,	1
he	1
had	1
once	1
enlivened	1
many	1
a	1
fiddler's	1
frolic	1
on	1
the	1
green;	1
and	1
at	1
melodious	1
even-tide,	1
with	1
his	1
gay	1
ha-ha!	1
had	1
turned	1
the	1
round	1
horizon	1
into	1
one	1
star-belled	1
tambourine.	1
So,	1
though	1
in	1
the	1
clear	1
air	1
of	1
day,	1
suspended	1
against	1
a	1
blue-veined	1
neck,	1
the	1
pure-watered	1
diamond	1
drop	1
will	1
healthful	1
glow;	1
yet,	1
when	1
the	1
cunning	1
jeweller	1
would	1
show	1
you	1
the	1
diamond	1
in	1
its	1
most	1
impressive	1
lustre,	1
he	1
lays	1
it	1
against	1
a	1
gloomy	1
ground,	1
and	1
then	1
lights	1
it	1
up,	1
not	1
by	1
the	1
sun,	1
but	1
by	1
some	1
unnatural	1
gases.	1
Then	1
come	1
out	1
those	1
fiery	1
effulgences,	1
infernally	1
superb;	1
then	1
the	1
evil-blazing	1
diamond,	1
once	1
the	1
divinest	1
symbol	1
of	1
the	1
crystal	1
skies,	1
looks	1
like	1
some	1
crown-jewel	1
stolen	1
from	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
Hell.	1
But	1
let	1
us	1
to	1
the	1
story.	1
It	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
ambergris	1
affair	1
Stubb's	1
after-oarsman	1
chanced	1
so	1
to	1
sprain	1
his	1
hand,	1
as	1
for	1
a	1
time	1
to	1
become	1
quite	1
maimed;	1
and,	1
temporarily,	1
Pip	1
was	1
put	1
into	1
his	1
place.	1
The	1
first	1
time	1
Stubb	1
lowered	1
with	1
him,	1
Pip	1
evinced	1
much	1
nervousness;	1
but	1
happily,	1
for	1
that	1
time,	1
escaped	1
close	1
contact	1
with	1
the	1
whale;	1
and	1
therefore	1
came	1
off	1
not	1
altogether	1
discreditably;	1
though	1
Stubb	1
observing	1
him,	1
took	1
care,	1
afterwards,	1
to	1
exhort	1
him	1
to	1
cherish	1
his	1
courageousness	1
to	1
the	1
utmost,	1
for	1
he	1
might	1
often	1
find	1
it	1
needful.	1
Now	1
upon	1
the	1
second	1
lowering,	1
the	1
boat	1
paddled	1
upon	1
the	1
whale;	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
fish	1
received	1
the	1
darted	1
iron,	1
it	1
gave	1
its	1
customary	1
rap,	1
which	1
happened,	1
in	1
this	1
instance,	1
to	1
be	1
right	1
under	1
poor	1
Pip's	1
seat.	1
The	1
involuntary	1
consternation	1
of	1
the	1
moment	1
caused	1
him	1
to	1
leap,	1
paddle	1
in	1
hand,	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
boat;	1
and	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
way,	1
that	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
slack	1
whale	1
line	1
coming	1
against	1
his	1
chest,	1
he	1
breasted	1
it	1
overboard	1
with	1
him,	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
become	1
entangled	1
in	1
it,	1
when	1
at	1
last	1
plumping	1
into	1
the	1
water.	1
That	1
instant	1
the	1
stricken	1
whale	1
started	1
on	1
a	1
fierce	1
run,	1
the	1
line	1
swiftly	1
straightened;	1
and	1
presto!	1
poor	1
Pip	1
came	1
all	1
foaming	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
chocks	1
of	1
the	1
boat,	1
remorselessly	1
dragged	1
there	1
by	1
the	1
line,	1
which	1
had	1
taken	1
several	1
turns	1
around	1
his	1
chest	1
and	1
neck.	1
Tashtego	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
bows.	1
He	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
fire	1
of	1
the	1
hunt.	1
He	1
hated	1
Pip	1
for	1
a	1
poltroon.	1
Snatching	1
the	1
boat-knife	1
from	1
its	1
sheath,	1
he	1
suspended	1
its	1
sharp	1
edge	1
over	1
the	1
line,	1
and	1
turning	1
towards	1
Stubb,	1
exclaimed	1
interrogatively,	1
"Cut?"	1
Meantime	1
Pip's	1
blue,	1
choked	1
face	1
plainly	1
looked,	1
Do,	1
for	1
God's	1
sake!	1
All	1
passed	1
in	1
a	1
flash.	1
In	1
less	1
than	1
half	1
a	1
minute,	1
this	1
entire	1
thing	1
happened.	1
"Damn	1
him,	1
cut!"	1
roared	1
Stubb;	1
and	1
so	1
the	1
whale	1
was	1
lost	1
and	1
Pip	1
was	1
saved.	1
So	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
recovered	1
himself,	1
the	1
poor	1
little	1
negro	1
was	1
assailed	1
by	1
yells	1
and	1
execrations	1
from	1
the	1
crew.	1
Tranquilly	1
permitting	1
these	1
irregular	1
cursings	1
to	1
evaporate,	1
Stubb	1
then	1
in	1
a	1
plain,	1
business-like,	1
but	1
still	1
half	1
humorous	1
manner,	1
cursed	1
Pip	1
officially;	1
and	1
that	1
done,	1
unofficially	1
gave	1
him	1
much	1
wholesome	1
advice.	1
The	1
substance	1
was,	1
Never	1
jump	1
from	1
a	1
boat,	1
Pip,	1
except--but	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
was	1
indefinite,	1
as	1
the	1
soundest	1
advice	1
ever	1
is.	1
Now,	1
in	1
general,	1
STICK	1
TO	1
THE	1
BOAT,	1
is	1
your	1
true	1
motto	1
in	1
whaling;	1
but	1
cases	1
will	1
sometimes	1
happen	1
when	1
LEAP	1
FROM	1
THE	1
BOAT,	1
is	1
still	1
better.	1
Moreover,	1
as	1
if	1
perceiving	1
at	1
last	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
should	1
give	1
undiluted	1
conscientious	1
advice	1
to	1
Pip,	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
leaving	1
him	1
too	1
wide	1
a	1
margin	1
to	1
jump	1
in	1
for	1
the	1
future;	1
Stubb	1
suddenly	1
dropped	1
all	1
advice,	1
and	1
concluded	1
with	1
a	1
peremptory	1
command,	1
"Stick	1
to	1
the	1
boat,	1
Pip,	1
or	1
by	1
the	1
Lord,	1
I	1
won't	1
pick	1
you	1
up	1
if	1
you	1
jump;	1
mind	1
that.	1
We	1
can't	1
afford	1
to	1
lose	1
whales	1
by	1
the	1
likes	1
of	1
you;	1
a	1
whale	1
would	1
sell	1
for	1
thirty	1
times	1
what	1
you	1
would,	1
Pip,	1
in	1
Alabama.	1
Bear	1
that	1
in	1
mind,	1
and	1
don't	1
jump	1
any	1
more."	1
Hereby	1
perhaps	1
Stubb	1
indirectly	1
hinted,	1
that	1
though	1
man	1
loved	1
his	1
fellow,	1
yet	1
man	1
is	1
a	1
money-making	1
animal,	1
which	1
propensity	1
too	1
often	1
interferes	1
with	1
his	1
benevolence.	1
But	1
we	1
are	1
all	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
Gods;	1
and	1
Pip	1
jumped	1
again.	1
It	1
was	1
under	1
very	1
similar	1
circumstances	1
to	1
the	1
first	1
performance;	1
but	1
this	1
time	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
breast	1
out	1
the	1
line;	1
and	1
hence,	1
when	1
the	1
whale	1
started	1
to	1
run,	1
Pip	1
was	1
left	1
behind	1
on	1
the	1
sea,	1
like	1
a	1
hurried	1
traveller's	1
trunk.	1
Alas!	1
Stubb	1
was	1
but	1
too	1
true	1
to	1
his	1
word.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
beautiful,	1
bounteous,	1
blue	1
day;	1
the	1
spangled	1
sea	1
calm	1
and	1
cool,	1
and	1
flatly	1
stretching	1
away,	1
all	1
round,	1
to	1
the	1
horizon,	1
like	1
gold-beater's	1
skin	1
hammered	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
extremest.	1
Bobbing	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
in	1
that	1
sea,	1
Pip's	1
ebon	1
head	1
showed	1
like	1
a	1
head	1
of	1
cloves.	1
No	1
boat-knife	1
was	1
lifted	1
when	1
he	1
fell	1
so	1
rapidly	1
astern.	1
Stubb's	1
inexorable	1
back	1
was	1
turned	1
upon	1
him;	1
and	1
the	1
whale	1
was	1
winged.	1
In	1
three	1
minutes,	1
a	1
whole	1
mile	1
of	1
shoreless	1
ocean	1
was	1
between	1
Pip	1
and	1
Stubb.	1
Out	1
from	1
the	1
centre	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
poor	1
Pip	1
turned	1
his	1
crisp,	1
curling,	1
black	1
head	1
to	1
the	1
sun,	1
another	1
lonely	1
castaway,	1
though	1
the	1
loftiest	1
and	1
the	1
brightest.	1
Now,	1
in	1
calm	1
weather,	1
to	1
swim	1
in	1
the	1
open	1
ocean	1
is	1
as	1
easy	1
to	1
the	1
practised	1
swimmer	1
as	1
to	1
ride	1
in	1
a	1
spring-carriage	1
ashore.	1
But	1
the	1
awful	1
lonesomeness	1
is	1
intolerable.	1
The	1
intense	1
concentration	1
of	1
self	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
heartless	1
immensity,	1
my	1
God!	1
who	1
can	1
tell	1
it?	1
Mark,	1
how	1
when	1
sailors	1
in	1
a	1
dead	1
calm	1
bathe	1
in	1
the	1
open	1
sea--mark	1
how	1
closely	1
they	1
hug	1
their	1
ship	1
and	1
only	1
coast	1
along	1
her	1
sides.	1
But	1
had	1
Stubb	1
really	1
abandoned	1
the	1
poor	1
little	1
negro	1
to	1
his	1
fate?	1
No;	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
mean	1
to,	1
at	1
least.	1
Because	1
there	1
were	1
two	1
boats	1
in	1
his	1
wake,	1
and	1
he	1
supposed,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
of	1
course	1
come	1
up	1
to	1
Pip	1
very	1
quickly,	1
and	1
pick	1
him	1
up;	1
though,	1
indeed,	1
such	1
considerations	1
towards	1
oarsmen	1
jeopardized	1
through	1
their	1
own	1
timidity,	1
is	1
not	1
always	1
manifested	1
by	1
the	1
hunters	1
in	1
all	1
similar	1
instances;	1
and	1
such	1
instances	1
not	1
unfrequently	1
occur;	1
almost	1
invariably	1
in	1
the	1
fishery,	1
a	1
coward,	1
so	1
called,	1
is	1
marked	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
ruthless	1
detestation	1
peculiar	1
to	1
military	1
navies	1
and	1
armies.	1
But	1
it	1
so	1
happened,	1
that	1
those	1
boats,	1
without	1
seeing	1
Pip,	1
suddenly	1
spying	1
whales	1
close	1
to	1
them	1
on	1
one	1
side,	1
turned,	1
and	1
gave	1
chase;	1
and	1
Stubb's	1
boat	1
was	1
now	1
so	1
far	1
away,	1
and	1
he	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
crew	1
so	1
intent	1
upon	1
his	1
fish,	1
that	1
Pip's	1
ringed	1
horizon	1
began	1
to	1
expand	1
around	1
him	1
miserably.	1
By	1
the	1
merest	1
chance	1
the	1
ship	1
itself	1
at	1
last	1
rescued	1
him;	1
but	1
from	1
that	1
hour	1
the	1
little	1
negro	1
went	1
about	1
the	1
deck	1
an	1
idiot;	1
such,	1
at	1
least,	1
they	1
said	1
he	1
was.	1
The	1
sea	1
had	1
jeeringly	1
kept	1
his	1
finite	1
body	1
up,	1
but	1
drowned	1
the	1
infinite	1
of	1
his	1
soul.	1
Not	1
drowned	1
entirely,	1
though.	1
Rather	1
carried	1
down	1
alive	1
to	1
wondrous	1
depths,	1
where	1
strange	1
shapes	1
of	1
the	1
unwarped	1
primal	1
world	1
glided	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
before	1
his	1
passive	1
eyes;	1
and	1
the	1
miser-merman,	1
Wisdom,	1
revealed	1
his	1
hoarded	1
heaps;	1
and	1
among	1
the	1
joyous,	1
heartless,	1
ever-juvenile	1
eternities,	1
Pip	1
saw	1
the	1
multitudinous,	1
God-omnipresent,	1
coral	1
insects,	1
that	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
firmament	1
of	1
waters	1
heaved	1
the	1
colossal	1
orbs.	1
He	1
saw	1
God's	1
foot	1
upon	1
the	1
treadle	1
of	1
the	1
loom,	1
and	1
spoke	1
it;	1
and	1
therefore	1
his	1
shipmates	1
called	1
him	1
mad.	1
So	1
man's	1
insanity	1
is	1
heaven's	1
sense;	1
and	1
wandering	1
from	1
all	1
mortal	1
reason,	1
man	1
comes	1
at	1
last	1
to	1
that	1
celestial	1
thought,	1
which,	1
to	1
reason,	1
is	1
absurd	1
and	1
frantic;	1
and	1
weal	1
or	1
woe,	1
feels	1
then	1
uncompromised,	1
indifferent	1
as	1
his	1
God.	1
For	1
the	1
rest,	1
blame	1
not	1
Stubb	1
too	1
hardly.	1
The	1
thing	1
is	1
common	1
in	1
that	1
fishery;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
sequel	1
of	1
the	1
narrative,	1
it	1
will	1
then	1
be	1
seen	1
what	1
like	1
abandonment	1
befell	1
myself.	1
CHAPTER	1
94	1
A	1
Squeeze	1
of	1
the	1
Hand.	1
That	1
whale	1
of	1
Stubb's,	1
so	1
dearly	1
purchased,	1
was	1
duly	1
brought	1
to	1
the	1
Pequod's	1
side,	1
where	1
all	1
those	1
cutting	1
and	1
hoisting	1
operations	1
previously	1
detailed,	1
were	1
regularly	1
gone	1
through,	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
baling	1
of	1
the	1
Heidelburgh	1
Tun,	1
or	1
Case.	1
While	1
some	1
were	1
occupied	1
with	1
this	1
latter	1
duty,	1
others	1
were	1
employed	1
in	1
dragging	1
away	1
the	1
larger	1
tubs,	1
so	1
soon	1
as	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
sperm;	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
proper	1
time	1
arrived,	1
this	1
same	1
sperm	1
was	1
carefully	1
manipulated	1
ere	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
try-works,	1
of	1
which	1
anon.	1
It	1
had	1
cooled	1
and	1
crystallized	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
degree,	1
that	1
when,	1
with	1
several	1
others,	1
I	1
sat	1
down	1
before	1
a	1
large	1
Constantine's	1
bath	1
of	1
it,	1
I	1
found	1
it	1
strangely	1
concreted	1
into	1
lumps,	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
rolling	1
about	1
in	1
the	1
liquid	1
part.	1
It	1
was	1
our	1
business	1
to	1
squeeze	1
these	1
lumps	1
back	1
into	1
fluid.	1
A	1
sweet	1
and	1
unctuous	1
duty!	1
No	1
wonder	1
that	1
in	1
old	1
times	1
this	1
sperm	1
was	1
such	1
a	1
favourite	1
cosmetic.	1
Such	1
a	1
clearer!	1
such	1
a	1
sweetener!	1
such	1
a	1
softener!	1
such	1
a	1
delicious	1
molifier!	1
After	1
having	1
my	1
hands	1
in	1
it	1
for	1
only	1
a	1
few	1
minutes,	1
my	1
fingers	1
felt	1
like	1
eels,	1
and	1
began,	1
as	1
it	1
were,	1
to	1
serpentine	1
and	1
spiralise.	1
As	1
I	1
sat	1
there	1
at	1
my	1
ease,	1
cross-legged	1
on	1
the	1
deck;	1
after	1
the	1
bitter	1
exertion	1
at	1
the	1
windlass;	1
under	1
a	1
blue	1
tranquil	1
sky;	1
the	1
ship	1
under	1
indolent	1
sail,	1
and	1
gliding	1
so	1
serenely	1
along;	1
as	1
I	1
bathed	1
my	1
hands	1
among	1
those	1
soft,	1
gentle	1
globules	1
of	1
infiltrated	1
tissues,	1
woven	1
almost	1
within	1
the	1
hour;	1
as	1
they	1
richly	1
broke	1
to	1
my	1
fingers,	1
and	1
discharged	1
all	1
their	1
opulence,	1
like	1
fully	1
ripe	1
grapes	1
their	1
wine;	1
as	1
I	1
snuffed	1
up	1
that	1
uncontaminated	1
aroma,--literally	1
and	1
truly,	1
like	1
the	1
smell	1
of	1
spring	1
violets;	1
I	1
declare	1
to	1
you,	1
that	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
I	1
lived	1
as	1
in	1
a	1
musky	1
meadow;	1
I	1
forgot	1
all	1
about	1
our	1
horrible	1
oath;	1
in	1
that	1
inexpressible	1
sperm,	1
I	1
washed	1
my	1
hands	1
and	1
my	1
heart	1
of	1
it;	1
I	1
almost	1
began	1
to	1
credit	1
the	1
old	1
Paracelsan	1
superstition	1
that	1
sperm	1
is	1
of	1
rare	1
virtue	1
in	1
allaying	1
the	1
heat	1
of	1
anger;	1
while	1
bathing	1
in	1
that	1
bath,	1
I	1
felt	1
divinely	1
free	1
from	1
all	1
ill-will,	1
or	1
petulance,	1
or	1
malice,	1
of	1
any	1
sort	1
whatsoever.	1
Squeeze!	1
squeeze!	1
squeeze!	1
all	1
the	1
morning	1
long;	1
I	1
squeezed	1
that	1
sperm	1
till	1
I	1
myself	1
almost	1
melted	1
into	1
it;	1
I	1
squeezed	1
that	1
sperm	1
till	1
a	1
strange	1
sort	1
of	1
insanity	1
came	1
over	1
me;	1
and	1
I	1
found	1
myself	1
unwittingly	1
squeezing	1
my	1
co-laborers'	1
hands	1
in	1
it,	1
mistaking	1
their	1
hands	1
for	1
the	1
gentle	1
globules.	1
Such	1
an	1
abounding,	1
affectionate,	1
friendly,	1
loving	1
feeling	1
did	1
this	1
avocation	1
beget;	1
that	1
at	1
last	1
I	1
was	1
continually	1
squeezing	1
their	1
hands,	1
and	1
looking	1
up	1
into	1
their	1
eyes	1
sentimentally;	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
to	1
say,--Oh!	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow	1
beings,	1
why	1
should	1
we	1
longer	1
cherish	1
any	1
social	1
acerbities,	1
or	1
know	1
the	1
slightest	1
ill-humor	1
or	1
envy!	1
Come;	1
let	1
us	1
squeeze	1
hands	1
all	1
round;	1
nay,	1
let	1
us	1
all	1
squeeze	1
ourselves	1
into	1
each	1
other;	1
let	1
us	1
squeeze	1
ourselves	1
universally	1
into	1
the	1
very	1
milk	1
and	1
sperm	1
of	1
kindness.	1
Would	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
keep	1
squeezing	1
that	1
sperm	1
for	1
ever!	1
For	1
now,	1
since	1
by	1
many	1
prolonged,	1
repeated	1
experiences,	1
I	1
have	1
perceived	1
that	1
in	1
all	1
cases	1
man	1
must	1
eventually	1
lower,	1
or	1
at	1
least	1
shift,	1
his	1
conceit	1
of	1
attainable	1
felicity;	1
not	1
placing	1
it	1
anywhere	1
in	1
the	1
intellect	1
or	1
the	1
fancy;	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
wife,	1
the	1
heart,	1
the	1
bed,	1
the	1
table,	1
the	1
saddle,	1
the	1
fireside,	1
the	1
country;	1
now	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
perceived	1
all	1
this,	1
I	1
am	1
ready	1
to	1
squeeze	1
case	1
eternally.	1
In	1
thoughts	1
of	1
the	1
visions	1
of	1
the	1
night,	1
I	1
saw	1
long	1
rows	1
of	1
angels	1
in	1
paradise,	1
each	1
with	1
his	1
hands	1
in	1
a	1
jar	1
of	1
spermaceti.	1
Now,	1
while	1
discoursing	1
of	1
sperm,	1
it	1
behooves	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
other	1
things	1
akin	1
to	1
it,	1
in	1
the	1
business	1
of	1
preparing	1
the	1
sperm	1
whale	1
for	1
the	1
try-works.	1
First	1
comes	1
white-horse,	1
so	1
called,	1
which	1
is	1
obtained	1
from	1
the	1
tapering	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
fish,	1
and	1
also	1
from	1
the	1
thicker	1
portions	1
of	1
his	1
flukes.	1
It	1
is	1
tough	1
with	1
congealed	1
tendons--a	1
wad	1
of	1
muscle--but	1
still	1
contains	1
some	1
oil.	1
After	1
being	1
severed	1
from	1
the	1
whale,	1
the	1
white-horse	1
is	1
first	1
cut	1
into	1
portable	1
oblongs	1
ere	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
mincer.	1
They	1
look	1
much	1
like	1
blocks	1
of	1
Berkshire	1
marble.	1
Plum-pudding	1
is	1
the	1
term	1
bestowed	1
upon	1
certain	1
fragmentary	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
whale's	1
flesh,	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
adhering	1
to	1
the	1
blanket	1
of	1
blubber,	1
and	1
often	1
participating	1
to	1
a	1
considerable	1
degree	1
in	1
its	1
unctuousness.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
most	1
refreshing,	1
convivial,	1
beautiful	1
object	1
to	1
behold.	1
As	1
its	1
name	1
imports,	1
it	1
is	1
of	1
an	1
exceedingly	1
rich,	1
mottled	1
tint,	1
with	1
a	1
bestreaked	1
snowy	1
and	1
golden	1
ground,	1
dotted	1
with	1
spots	1
of	1
the	1
deepest	1
crimson	1
and	1
purple.	1
It	1
is	1
plums	1
of	1
rubies,	1
in	1
pictures	1
of	1
citron.	1
Spite	1
of	1
reason,	1
it	1
is	1
hard	1
to	1
keep	1
yourself	1
from	1
eating	1
it.	1
I	1
confess,	1
that	1
once	1
I	1
stole	1
behind	1
the	1
foremast	1
to	1
try	1
it.	1
It	1
tasted	1
something	1
as	1
I	1
should	1
conceive	1
a	1
royal	1
cutlet	1
from	1
the	1
thigh	1
of	1
Louis	1
le	1
Gros	1
might	1
have	1
tasted,	1
supposing	1
him	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
killed	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
after	1
the	1
venison	1
season,	1
and	1
that	1
particular	1
venison	1
season	1
contemporary	1
with	1
an	1
unusually	1
fine	1
vintage	1
of	1
the	1
vineyards	1
of	1
Champagne.	1
There	1
is	1
another	1
substance,	1
and	1
a	1
very	1
singular	1
one,	1
which	1
turns	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
this	1
business,	1
but	1
which	1
I	1
feel	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
very	1
puzzling	1
adequately	1
to	1
describe.	1
It	1
is	1
called	1
slobgollion;	1
an	1
appellation	1
original	1
with	1
the	1
whalemen,	1
and	1
even	1
so	1
is	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
substance.	1
It	1
is	1
an	1
ineffably	1
oozy,	1
stringy	1
affair,	1
most	1
frequently	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
tubs	1
of	1
sperm,	1
after	1
a	1
prolonged	1
squeezing,	1
and	1
subsequent	1
decanting.	1
I	1
hold	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
wondrously	1
thin,	1
ruptured	1
membranes	1
of	1
the	1
case,	1
coalescing.	1
Gurry,	1
so	1
called,	1
is	1
a	1
term	1
properly	1
belonging	1
to	1
right	1
whalemen,	1
but	1
sometimes	1
incidentally	1
used	1
by	1
the	1
sperm	1
fishermen.	1
It	1
designates	1
the	1
dark,	1
glutinous	1
substance	1
which	1
is	1
scraped	1
off	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
the	1
Greenland	1
or	1
right	1
whale,	1
and	1
much	1
of	1
which	1
covers	1
the	1
decks	1
of	1
those	1
inferior	1
souls	1
who	1
hunt	1
that	1
ignoble	1
Leviathan.	1
Nippers.	1
Strictly	1
this	1
word	1
is	1
not	1
indigenous	1
to	1
the	1
whale's	1
vocabulary.	1
But	1
as	1
applied	1
by	1
whalemen,	1
it	1
becomes	1
so.	1
A	1
whaleman's	1
nipper	1
is	1
a	1
short	1
firm	1
strip	1
of	1
tendinous	1
stuff	1
cut	1
from	1
the	1
tapering	1
part	1
of	1
Leviathan's	1
tail:	1
it	1
averages	1
an	1
inch	1
in	1
thickness,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
rest,	1
is	1
about	1
the	1
size	1
of	1
the	1
iron	1
part	1
of	1
a	1
hoe.	1
Edgewise	1
moved	1
along	1
the	1
oily	1
deck,	1
it	1
operates	1
like	1
a	1
leathern	1
squilgee;	1
and	1
by	1
nameless	1
blandishments,	1
as	1
of	1
magic,	1
allures	1
along	1
with	1
it	1
all	1
impurities.	1
But	1
to	1
learn	1
all	1
about	1
these	1
recondite	1
matters,	1
your	1
best	1
way	1
is	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
descend	1
into	1
the	1
blubber-room,	1
and	1
have	1
a	1
long	1
talk	1
with	1
its	1
inmates.	1
This	1
place	1
has	1
previously	1
been	1
mentioned	1
as	1
the	1
receptacle	1
for	1
the	1
blanket-pieces,	1
when	1
stript	1
and	1
hoisted	1
from	1
the	1
whale.	1
When	1
the	1
proper	1
time	1
arrives	1
for	1
cutting	1
up	1
its	1
contents,	1
this	1
apartment	1
is	1
a	1
scene	1
of	1
terror	1
to	1
all	1
tyros,	1
especially	1
by	1
night.	1
On	1
one	1
side,	1
lit	1
by	1
a	1
dull	1
lantern,	1
a	1
space	1
has	1
been	1
left	1
clear	1
for	1
the	1
workmen.	1
They	1
generally	1
go	1
in	1
pairs,--a	1
pike-and-gaffman	1
and	1
a	1
spade-man.	1
The	1
whaling-pike	1
is	1
similar	1
to	1
a	1
frigate's	1
boarding-weapon	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
name.	1
The	1
gaff	1
is	1
something	1
like	1
a	1
boat-hook.	1
With	1
his	1
gaff,	1
the	1
gaffman	1
hooks	1
on	1
to	1
a	1
sheet	1
of	1
blubber,	1
and	1
strives	1
to	1
hold	1
it	1
from	1
slipping,	1
as	1
the	1
ship	1
pitches	1
and	1
lurches	1
about.	1
Meanwhile,	1
the	1
spade-man	1
stands	1
on	1
the	1
sheet	1
itself,	1
perpendicularly	1
chopping	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
portable	1
horse-pieces.	1
This	1
spade	1
is	1
sharp	1
as	1
hone	1
can	1
make	1
it;	1
the	1
spademan's	1
feet	1
are	1
shoeless;	1
the	1
thing	1
he	1
stands	1
on	1
will	1
sometimes	1
irresistibly	1
slide	1
away	1
from	1
him,	1
like	1
a	1
sledge.	1
If	1
he	1
cuts	1
off	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
toes,	1
or	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
assistants',	1
would	1
you	1
be	1
very	1
much	1
astonished?	1
Toes	1
are	1
scarce	1
among	1
veteran	1
blubber-room	1
men.	1
CHAPTER	1
95	1
The	1
Cassock.	1
Had	1
you	1
stepped	1
on	1
board	1
the	1
Pequod	1
at	1
a	1
certain	1
juncture	1
of	1
this	1
post-mortemizing	1
of	1
the	1
whale;	1
and	1
had	1
you	1
strolled	1
forward	1
nigh	1
the	1
windlass,	1
pretty	1
sure	1
am	1
I	1
that	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
scanned	1
with	1
no	1
small	1
curiosity	1
a	1
very	1
strange,	1
enigmatical	1
object,	1
which	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
seen	1
there,	1
lying	1
along	1
lengthwise	1
in	1
the	1
lee	1
scuppers.	1
Not	1
the	1
wondrous	1
cistern	1
in	1
the	1
whale's	1
huge	1
head;	1
not	1
the	1
prodigy	1
of	1
his	1
unhinged	1
lower	1
jaw;	1
not	1
the	1
miracle	1
of	1
his	1
symmetrical	1
tail;	1
none	1
of	1
these	1
would	1
so	1
surprise	1
you,	1
as	1
half	1
a	1
glimpse	1
of	1
that	1
unaccountable	1
cone,--longer	1
than	1
a	1
Kentuckian	1
is	1
tall,	1
nigh	1
a	1
foot	1
in	1
diameter	1
at	1
the	1
base,	1
and	1
jet-black	1
as	1
Yojo,	1
the	1
ebony	1
idol	1
of	1
Queequeg.	1
And	1
an	1
idol,	1
indeed,	1
it	1
is;	1
or,	1
rather,	1
in	1
old	1
times,	1
its	1
likeness	1
was.	1
Such	1
an	1
idol	1
as	1
that	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
secret	1
groves	1
of	1
Queen	1
Maachah	1
in	1
Judea;	1
and	1
for	1
worshipping	1
which,	1
King	1
Asa,	1
her	1
son,	1
did	1
depose	1
her,	1
and	1
destroyed	1
the	1
idol,	1
and	1
burnt	1
it	1
for	1
an	1
abomination	1
at	1
the	1
brook	1
Kedron,	1
as	1
darkly	1
set	1
forth	1
in	1
the	1
15th	1
chapter	1
of	1
the	1
First	1
Book	1
of	1
Kings.	1
Look	1
at	1
the	1
sailor,	1
called	1
the	1
mincer,	1
who	1
now	1
comes	1
along,	1
and	1
assisted	1
by	1
two	1
allies,	1
heavily	1
backs	1
the	1
grandissimus,	1
as	1
the	1
mariners	1
call	1
it,	1
and	1
with	1
bowed	1
shoulders,	1
staggers	1
off	1
with	1
it	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
a	1
grenadier	1
carrying	1
a	1
dead	1
comrade	1
from	1
the	1
field.	1
Extending	1
it	1
upon	1
the	1
forecastle	1
deck,	1
he	1
now	1
proceeds	1
cylindrically	1
to	1
remove	1
its	1
dark	1
pelt,	1
as	1
an	1
African	1
hunter	1
the	1
pelt	1
of	1
a	1
boa.	1
This	1
done	1
he	1
turns	1
the	1
pelt	1
inside	1
out,	1
like	1
a	1
pantaloon	1
leg;	1
gives	1
it	1
a	1
good	1
stretching,	1
so	1
as	1
almost	1
to	1
double	1
its	1
diameter;	1
and	1
at	1
last	1
hangs	1
it,	1
well	1
spread,	1
in	1
the	1
rigging,	1
to	1
dry.	1
Ere	1
long,	1
it	1
is	1
taken	1
down;	1
when	1
removing	1
some	1
three	1
feet	1
of	1
it,	1
towards	1
the	1
pointed	1
extremity,	1
and	1
then	1
cutting	1
two	1
slits	1
for	1
arm-holes	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
end,	1
he	1
lengthwise	1
slips	1
himself	1
bodily	1
into	1
it.	1
The	1
mincer	1
now	1
stands	1
before	1
you	1
invested	1
in	1
the	1
full	1
canonicals	1
of	1
his	1
calling.	1
Immemorial	1
to	1
all	1
his	1
order,	1
this	1
investiture	1
alone	1
will	1
adequately	1
protect	1
him,	1
while	1
employed	1
in	1
the	1
peculiar	1
functions	1
of	1
his	1
office.	1
That	1
office	1
consists	1
in	1
mincing	1
the	1
horse-pieces	1
of	1
blubber	1
for	1
the	1
pots;	1
an	1
operation	1
which	1
is	1
conducted	1
at	1
a	1
curious	1
wooden	1
horse,	1
planted	1
endwise	1
against	1
the	1
bulwarks,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
capacious	1
tub	1
beneath	1
it,	1
into	1
which	1
the	1
minced	1
pieces	1
drop,	1
fast	1
as	1
the	1
sheets	1
from	1
a	1
rapt	1
orator's	1
desk.	1
Arrayed	1
in	1
decent	1
black;	1
occupying	1
a	1
conspicuous	1
pulpit;	1
intent	1
on	1
bible	1
leaves;	1
what	1
a	1
candidate	1
for	1
an	1
archbishopric,	1
what	1
a	1
lad	1
for	1
a	1
Pope	1
were	1
this	1
mincer!*	1
*Bible	1
leaves!	1
Bible	1
leaves!	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
invariable	1
cry	1
from	1
the	1
mates	1
to	1
the	1
mincer.	1
It	1
enjoins	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
careful,	1
and	1
cut	1
his	1
work	1
into	1
as	1
thin	1
slices	1
as	1
possible,	1
inasmuch	1
as	1
by	1
so	1
doing	1
the	1
business	1
of	1
boiling	1
out	1
the	1
oil	1
is	1
much	1
accelerated,	1
and	1
its	1
quantity	1
considerably	1
increased,	1
besides	1
perhaps	1
improving	1
it	1
in	1
quality.	1
CHAPTER	1
96	1
The	1
Try-Works.	1
Besides	1
her	1
hoisted	1
boats,	1
an	1
American	1
whaler	1
is	1
outwardly	1
distinguished	1
by	1
her	1
try-works.	1
She	1
presents	1
the	1
curious	1
anomaly	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
solid	1
masonry	1
joining	1
with	1
oak	1
and	1
hemp	1
in	1
constituting	1
the	1
completed	1
ship.	1
It	1
is	1
as	1
if	1
from	1
the	1
open	1
field	1
a	1
brick-kiln	1
were	1
transported	1
to	1
her	1
planks.	1
The	1
try-works	1
are	1
planted	1
between	1
the	1
foremast	1
and	1
mainmast,	1
the	1
most	1
roomy	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
deck.	1
The	1
timbers	1
beneath	1
are	1
of	1
a	1
peculiar	1
strength,	1
fitted	1
to	1
sustain	1
the	1
weight	1
of	1
an	1
almost	1
solid	1
mass	1
of	1
brick	1
and	1
mortar,	1
some	1
ten	1
feet	1
by	1
eight	1
square,	1
and	1
five	1
in	1
height.	1
The	1
foundation	1
does	1
not	1
penetrate	1
the	1
deck,	1
but	1
the	1
masonry	1
is	1
firmly	1
secured	1
to	1
the	1
surface	1
by	1
ponderous	1
knees	1
of	1
iron	1
bracing	1
it	1
on	1
all	1
sides,	1
and	1
screwing	1
it	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
timbers.	1
On	1
the	1
flanks	1
it	1
is	1
cased	1
with	1
wood,	1
and	1
at	1
top	1
completely	1
covered	1
by	1
a	1
large,	1
sloping,	1
battened	1
hatchway.	1
Removing	1
this	1
hatch	1
we	1
expose	1
the	1
great	1
try-pots,	1
two	1
in	1
number,	1
and	1
each	1
of	1
several	1
barrels'	1
capacity.	1
When	1
not	1
in	1
use,	1
they	1
are	1
kept	1
remarkably	1
clean.	1
Sometimes	1
they	1
are	1
polished	1
with	1
soapstone	1
and	1
sand,	1
till	1
they	1
shine	1
within	1
like	1
silver	1
punch-bowls.	1
During	1
the	1
night-watches	1
some	1
cynical	1
old	1
sailors	1
will	1
crawl	1
into	1
them	1
and	1
coil	1
themselves	1
away	1
there	1
for	1
a	1
nap.	1
While	1
employed	1
in	1
polishing	1
them--one	1
man	1
in	1
each	1
pot,	1
side	1
by	1
side--many	1
confidential	1
communications	1
are	1
carried	1
on,	1
over	1
the	1
iron	1
lips.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
place	1
also	1
for	1
profound	1
mathematical	1
meditation.	1
It	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
left	1
hand	1
try-pot	1
of	1
the	1
Pequod,	1
with	1
the	1
soapstone	1
diligently	1
circling	1
round	1
me,	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
first	1
indirectly	1
struck	1
by	1
the	1
remarkable	1
fact,	1
that	1
in	1
geometry	1
all	1
bodies	1
gliding	1
along	1
the	1
cycloid,	1
my	1
soapstone	1
for	1
example,	1
will	1
descend	1
from	1
any	1
point	1
in	1
precisely	1
the	1
same	1
time.	1
Removing	1
the	1
fire-board	1
from	1
the	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
try-works,	1
the	1
bare	1
masonry	1
of	1
that	1
side	1
is	1
exposed,	1
penetrated	1
by	1
the	1
two	1
iron	1
mouths	1
of	1
the	1
furnaces,	1
directly	1
underneath	1
the	1
pots.	1
These	1
mouths	1
are	1
fitted	1
with	1
heavy	1
doors	1
of	1
iron.	1
The	1
intense	1
heat	1
of	1
the	1
fire	1
is	1
prevented	1
from	1
communicating	1
itself	1
to	1
the	1
deck,	1
by	1
means	1
of	1
a	1
shallow	1
reservoir	1
extending	1
under	1
the	1
entire	1
inclosed	1
surface	1
of	1
the	1
works.	1
By	1
a	1
tunnel	1
inserted	1
at	1
the	1
rear,	1
this	1
reservoir	1
is	1
kept	1
replenished	1
with	1
water	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
it	1
evaporates.	1
There	1
are	1
no	1
external	1
chimneys;	1
they	1
open	1
direct	1
from	1
the	1
rear	1
wall.	1
And	1
here	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
back	1
for	1
a	1
moment.	1
It	1
was	1
about	1
nine	1
o'clock	1
at	1
night	1
that	1
the	1
Pequod's	1
try-works	1
were	1
first	1
started	1
on	1
this	1
present	1
voyage.	1
It	1
belonged	1
to	1
Stubb	1
to	1
oversee	1
the	1
business.	1
"All	1
ready	1
there?	1
Off	1
hatch,	1
then,	1
and	1
start	1
her.	1
You	1
cook,	1
fire	1
the	1
works."	1
This	1
was	1
an	1
easy	1
thing,	1
for	1
the	1
carpenter	1
had	1
been	1
thrusting	1
his	1
shavings	1
into	1
the	1
furnace	1
throughout	1
the	1
passage.	1
Here	1
be	1
it	1
said	1
that	1
in	1
a	1
whaling	1
voyage	1
the	1
first	1
fire	1
in	1
the	1
try-works	1
has	1
to	1
be	1
fed	1
for	1
a	1
time	1
with	1
wood.	1
After	1
that	1
no	1
wood	1
is	1
used,	1
except	1
as	1
a	1
means	1
of	1
quick	1
ignition	1
to	1
the	1
staple	1
fuel.	1
In	1
a	1
word,	1
after	1
being	1
tried	1
out,	1
the	1
crisp,	1
shrivelled	1
blubber,	1
now	1
called	1
scraps	1
or	1
fritters,	1
still	1
contains	1
considerable	1
of	1
its	1
unctuous	1
properties.	1
These	1
fritters	1
feed	1
the	1
flames.	1
Like	1
a	1
plethoric	1
burning	1
martyr,	1
or	1
a	1
self-consuming	1
misanthrope,	1
once	1
ignited,	1
the	1
whale	1
supplies	1
his	1
own	1
fuel	1
and	1
burns	1
by	1
his	1
own	1
body.	1
Would	1
that	1
he	1
consumed	1
his	1
own	1
smoke!	1
for	1
his	1
smoke	1
is	1
horrible	1
to	1
inhale,	1
and	1
inhale	1
it	1
you	1
must,	1
and	1
not	1
only	1
that,	1
but	1
you	1
must	1
live	1
in	1
it	1
for	1
the	1
time.	1
It	1
has	1
an	1
unspeakable,	1
wild,	1
Hindoo	1
odor	1
about	1
it,	1
such	1
as	1
may	1
lurk	1
in	1
the	1
vicinity	1
of	1
funereal	1
pyres.	1
It	1
smells	1
like	1
the	1
left	1
wing	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
judgment;	1
it	1
is	1
an	1
argument	1
for	1
the	1
pit.	1
By	1
midnight	1
the	1
works	1
were	1
in	1
full	1
operation.	1
We	1
were	1
clear	1
from	1
the	1
carcase;	1
sail	1
had	1
been	1
made;	1
the	1
wind	1
was	1
freshening;	1
the	1
wild	1
ocean	1
darkness	1
was	1
intense.	1
But	1
that	1
darkness	1
was	1
licked	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
fierce	1
flames,	1
which	1
at	1
intervals	1
forked	1
forth	1
from	1
the	1
sooty	1
flues,	1
and	1
illuminated	1
every	1
lofty	1
rope	1
in	1
the	1
rigging,	1
as	1
with	1
the	1
famed	1
Greek	1
fire.	1
The	1
burning	1
ship	1
drove	1
on,	1
as	1
if	1
remorselessly	1
commissioned	1
to	1
some	1
vengeful	1
deed.	1
So	1
the	1
pitch	1
and	1
sulphur-freighted	1
brigs	1
of	1
the	1
bold	1
Hydriote,	1
Canaris,	1
issuing	1
from	1
their	1
midnight	1
harbors,	1
with	1
broad	1
sheets	1
of	1
flame	1
for	1
sails,	1
bore	1
down	1
upon	1
the	1
Turkish	1
frigates,	1
and	1
folded	1
them	1
in	1
conflagrations.	1
The	1
hatch,	1
removed	1
from	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
works,	1
now	1
afforded	1
a	1
wide	1
hearth	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
them.	1
Standing	1
on	1
this	1
were	1
the	1
Tartarean	1
shapes	1
of	1
the	1
pagan	1
harpooneers,	1
always	1
the	1
whale-ship's	1
stokers.	1
With	1
huge	1
pronged	1
poles	1
they	1
pitched	1
hissing	1
masses	1
of	1
blubber	1
into	1
the	1
scalding	1
pots,	1
or	1
stirred	1
up	1
the	1
fires	1
beneath,	1
till	1
the	1
snaky	1
flames	1
darted,	1
curling,	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
doors	1
to	1
catch	1
them	1
by	1
the	1
feet.	1
The	1
smoke	1
rolled	1
away	1
in	1
sullen	1
heaps.	1
To	1
every	1
pitch	1
of	1
the	1
ship	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
pitch	1
of	1
the	1
boiling	1
oil,	1
which	1
seemed	1
all	1
eagerness	1
to	1
leap	1
into	1
their	1
faces.	1
Opposite	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
works,	1
on	1
the	1
further	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
wide	1
wooden	1
hearth,	1
was	1
the	1
windlass.	1
This	1
served	1
for	1
a	1
sea-sofa.	1
Here	1
lounged	1
the	1
watch,	1
when	1
not	1
otherwise	1
employed,	1
looking	1
into	1
the	1
red	1
heat	1
of	1
the	1
fire,	1
till	1
their	1
eyes	1
felt	1
scorched	1
in	1
their	1
heads.	1
Their	1
tawny	1
features,	1
now	1
all	1
begrimed	1
with	1
smoke	1
and	1
sweat,	1
their	1
matted	1
beards,	1
and	1
the	1
contrasting	1
barbaric	1
brilliancy	1
of	1
their	1
teeth,	1
all	1
these	1
were	1
strangely	1
revealed	1
in	1
the	1
capricious	1
emblazonings	1
of	1
the	1
works.	1
As	1
they	1
narrated	1
to	1
each	1
other	1
their	1
unholy	1
adventures,	1
their	1
tales	1
of	1
terror	1
told	1
in	1
words	1
of	1
mirth;	1
as	1
their	1
uncivilized	1
laughter	1
forked	1
upwards	1
out	1
of	1
them,	1
like	1
the	1
flames	1
from	1
the	1
furnace;	1
as	1
to	1
and	1
fro,	1
in	1
their	1
front,	1
the	1
harpooneers	1
wildly	1
gesticulated	1
with	1
their	1
huge	1
pronged	1
forks	1
and	1
dippers;	1
as	1
the	1
wind	1
howled	1
on,	1
and	1
the	1
sea	1
leaped,	1
and	1
the	1
ship	1
groaned	1
and	1
dived,	1
and	1
yet	1
steadfastly	1
shot	1
her	1
red	1
hell	1
further	1
and	1
further	1
into	1
the	1
blackness	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
and	1
the	1
night,	1
and	1
scornfully	1
champed	1
the	1
white	1
bone	1
in	1
her	1
mouth,	1
and	1
viciously	1
spat	1
round	1
her	1
on	1
all	1
sides;	1
then	1
the	1
rushing	1
Pequod,	1
freighted	1
with	1
savages,	1
and	1
laden	1
with	1
fire,	1
and	1
burning	1
a	1
corpse,	1
and	1
plunging	1
into	1
that	1
blackness	1
of	1
darkness,	1
seemed	1
the	1
material	1
counterpart	1
of	1
her	1
monomaniac	1
commander's	1
soul.	1
So	1
seemed	1
it	1
to	1
me,	1
as	1
I	1
stood	1
at	1
her	1
helm,	1
and	1
for	1
long	1
hours	1
silently	1
guided	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
this	1
fire-ship	1
on	1
the	1
sea.	1
Wrapped,	1
for	1
that	1
interval,	1
in	1
darkness	1
myself,	1
I	1
but	1
the	1
better	1
saw	1
the	1
redness,	1
the	1
madness,	1
the	1
ghastliness	1
of	1
others.	1
The	1
continual	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
fiend	1
shapes	1
before	1
me,	1
capering	1
half	1
in	1
smoke	1
and	1
half	1
in	1
fire,	1
these	1
at	1
last	1
begat	1
kindred	1
visions	1
in	1
my	1
soul,	1
so	1
soon	1
as	1
I	1
began	1
to	1
yield	1
to	1
that	1
unaccountable	1
drowsiness	1
which	1
ever	1
would	1
come	1
over	1
me	1
at	1
a	1
midnight	1
helm.	1
But	1
that	1
night,	1
in	1
particular,	1
a	1
strange	1
(and	1
ever	1
since	1
inexplicable)	1
thing	1
occurred	1
to	1
me.	1
Starting	1
from	1
a	1
brief	1
standing	1
sleep,	1
I	1
was	1
horribly	1
conscious	1
of	1
something	1
fatally	1
wrong.	1
The	1
jaw-bone	1
tiller	1
smote	1
my	1
side,	1
which	1
leaned	1
against	1
it;	1
in	1
my	1
ears	1
was	1
the	1
low	1
hum	1
of	1
sails,	1
just	1
beginning	1
to	1
shake	1
in	1
the	1
wind;	1
I	1
thought	1
my	1
eyes	1
were	1
open;	1
I	1
was	1
half	1
conscious	1
of	1
putting	1
my	1
fingers	1
to	1
the	1
lids	1
and	1
mechanically	1
stretching	1
them	1
still	1
further	1
apart.	1
But,	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
this,	1
I	1
could	1
see	1
no	1
compass	1
before	1
me	1
to	1
steer	1
by;	1
though	1
it	1
seemed	1
but	1
a	1
minute	1
since	1
I	1
had	1
been	1
watching	1
the	1
card,	1
by	1
the	1
steady	1
binnacle	1
lamp	1
illuminating	1
it.	1
Nothing	1
seemed	1
before	1
me	1
but	1
a	1
jet	1
gloom,	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
made	1
ghastly	1
by	1
flashes	1
of	1
redness.	1
Uppermost	1
was	1
the	1
impression,	1
that	1
whatever	1
swift,	1
rushing	1
thing	1
I	1
stood	1
on	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
bound	1
to	1
any	1
haven	1
ahead	1
as	1
rushing	1
from	1
all	1
havens	1
astern.	1
A	1
stark,	1
bewildered	1
feeling,	1
as	1
of	1
death,	1
came	1
over	1
me.	1
Convulsively	1
my	1
hands	1
grasped	1
the	1
tiller,	1
but	1
with	1
the	1
crazy	1
conceit	1
that	1
the	1
tiller	1
was,	1
somehow,	1
in	1
some	1
enchanted	1
way,	1
inverted.	1
My	1
God!	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
me?	1
thought	1
I.	1
Lo!	1
in	1
my	1
brief	1
sleep	1
I	1
had	1
turned	1
myself	1
about,	1
and	1
was	1
fronting	1
the	1
ship's	1
stern,	1
with	1
my	1
back	1
to	1
her	1
prow	1
and	1
the	1
compass.	1
In	1
an	1
instant	1
I	1
faced	1
back,	1
just	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
prevent	1
the	1
vessel	1
from	1
flying	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
wind,	1
and	1
very	1
probably	1
capsizing	1
her.	1
How	1
glad	1
and	1
how	1
grateful	1
the	1
relief	1
from	1
this	1
unnatural	1
hallucination	1
of	1
the	1
night,	1
and	1
the	1
fatal	1
contingency	1
of	1
being	1
brought	1
by	1
the	1
lee!	1
Look	1
not	1
too	1
long	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
fire,	1
O	1
man!	1
Never	1
dream	1
with	1
thy	1
hand	1
on	1
the	1
helm!	1
Turn	1
not	1
thy	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
compass;	1
accept	1
the	1
first	1
hint	1
of	1
the	1
hitching	1
tiller;	1
believe	1
not	1
the	1
artificial	1
fire,	1
when	1
its	1
redness	1
makes	1
all	1
things	1
look	1
ghastly.	1
To-morrow,	1
in	1
the	1
natural	1
sun,	1
the	1
skies	1
will	1
be	1
bright;	1
those	1
who	1
glared	1
like	1
devils	1
in	1
the	1
forking	1
flames,	1
the	1
morn	1
will	1
show	1
in	1
far	1
other,	1
at	1
least	1
gentler,	1
relief;	1
the	1
glorious,	1
golden,	1
glad	1
sun,	1
the	1
only	1
true	1
lamp--all	1
others	1
but	1
liars!	1
Nevertheless	1
the	1
sun	1
hides	1
not	1
Virginia's	1
Dismal	1
Swamp,	1
nor	1
Rome's	1
accursed	1
Campagna,	1
nor	1
wide	1
Sahara,	1
nor	1
all	1
the	1
millions	1
of	1
miles	1
of	1
deserts	1
and	1
of	1
griefs	1
beneath	1
the	1
moon.	1
The	1
sun	1
hides	1
not	1
the	1
ocean,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
dark	1
side	1
of	1
this	1
earth,	1
and	1
which	1
is	1
two	1
thirds	1
of	1
this	1
earth.	1
So,	1
therefore,	1
that	1
mortal	1
man	1
who	1
hath	1
more	1
of	1
joy	1
than	1
sorrow	1
in	1
him,	1
that	1
mortal	1
man	1
cannot	1
be	1
true--not	1
true,	1
or	1
undeveloped.	1
With	1
books	1
the	1
same.	1
The	1
truest	1
of	1
all	1
men	1
was	1
the	1
Man	1
of	1
Sorrows,	1
and	1
the	1
truest	1
of	1
all	1
books	1
is	1
Solomon's,	1
and	1
Ecclesiastes	1
is	1
the	1
fine	1
hammered	1
steel	1
of	1
woe.	1
"All	1
is	1
vanity."	1
ALL.	1
This	1
wilful	1
world	1
hath	1
not	1
got	1
hold	1
of	1
unchristian	1
Solomon's	1
wisdom	1
yet.	1
But	1
he	1
who	1
dodges	1
hospitals	1
and	1
jails,	1
and	1
walks	1
fast	1
crossing	1
graveyards,	1
and	1
would	1
rather	1
talk	1
of	1
operas	1
than	1
hell;	1
calls	1
Cowper,	1
Young,	1
Pascal,	1
Rousseau,	1
poor	1
devils	1
all	1
of	1
sick	1
men;	1
and	1
throughout	1
a	1
care-free	1
lifetime	1
swears	1
by	1
Rabelais	1
as	1
passing	1
wise,	1
and	1
therefore	1
jolly;--not	1
that	1
man	1
is	1
fitted	1
to	1
sit	1
down	1
on	1
tomb-stones,	1
and	1
break	1
the	1
green	1
damp	1
mould	1
with	1
unfathomably	1
wondrous	1
Solomon.	1
But	1
even	1
Solomon,	1
he	1
says,	1
"the	1
man	1
that	1
wandereth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
understanding	1
shall	1
remain"	1
(I.E.,	1
even	1
while	1
living)	1
"in	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
the	1
dead."	1
Give	1
not	1
thyself	1
up,	1
then,	1
to	1
fire,	1
lest	1
it	1
invert	1
thee,	1
deaden	1
thee;	1
as	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
it	1
did	1
me.	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
wisdom	1
that	1
is	1
woe;	1
but	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
woe	1
that	1
is	1
madness.	1
And	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
Catskill	1
eagle	1
in	1
some	1
souls	1
that	1
can	1
alike	1
dive	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
blackest	1
gorges,	1
and	1
soar	1
out	1
of	1
them	1
again	1
and	1
become	1
invisible	1
in	1
the	1
sunny	1
spaces.	1
And	1
even	1
if	1
he	1
for	1
ever	1
flies	1
within	1
the	1
gorge,	1
that	1
gorge	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
mountains;	1
so	1
that	1
even	1
in	1
his	1
lowest	1
swoop	1
the	1
mountain	1
eagle	1
is	1
still	1
higher	1
than	1
other	1
birds	1
upon	1
the	1
plain,	1
even	1
though	1
they	1
soar.	1
CHAPTER	1
97	1
The	1
Lamp.	1
Had	1
you	1
descended	1
from	1
the	1
Pequod's	1
try-works	1
to	1
the	1
Pequod's	1
forecastle,	1
where	1
the	1
off	1
duty	1
watch	1
were	1
sleeping,	1
for	1
one	1
single	1
moment	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
almost	1
thought	1
you	1
were	1
standing	1
in	1
some	1
illuminated	1
shrine	1
of	1
canonized	1
kings	1
and	1
counsellors.	1
There	1
they	1
lay	1
in	1
their	1
triangular	1
oaken	1
vaults,	1
each	1
mariner	1
a	1
chiselled	1
muteness;	1
a	1
score	1
of	1
lamps	1
flashing	1
upon	1
his	1
hooded	1
eyes.	1
In	1
merchantmen,	1
oil	1
for	1
the	1
sailor	1
is	1
more	1
scarce	1
than	1
the	1
milk	1
of	1
queens.	1
To	1
dress	1
in	1
the	1
dark,	1
and	1
eat	1
in	1
the	1
dark,	1
and	1
stumble	1
in	1
darkness	1
to	1
his	1
pallet,	1
this	1
is	1
his	1
usual	1
lot.	1
But	1
the	1
whaleman,	1
as	1
he	1
seeks	1
the	1
food	1
of	1
light,	1
so	1
he	1
lives	1
in	1
light.	1
He	1
makes	1
his	1
berth	1
an	1
Aladdin's	1
lamp,	1
and	1
lays	1
him	1
down	1
in	1
it;	1
so	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
pitchiest	1
night	1
the	1
ship's	1
black	1
hull	1
still	1
houses	1
an	1
illumination.	1
See	1
with	1
what	1
entire	1
freedom	1
the	1
whaleman	1
takes	1
his	1
handful	1
of	1
lamps--often	1
but	1
old	1
bottles	1
and	1
vials,	1
though--to	1
the	1
copper	1
cooler	1
at	1
the	1
try-works,	1
and	1
replenishes	1
them	1
there,	1
as	1
mugs	1
of	1
ale	1
at	1
a	1
vat.	1
He	1
burns,	1
too,	1
the	1
purest	1
of	1
oil,	1
in	1
its	1
unmanufactured,	1
and,	1
therefore,	1
unvitiated	1
state;	1
a	1
fluid	1
unknown	1
to	1
solar,	1
lunar,	1
or	1
astral	1
contrivances	1
ashore.	1
It	1
is	1
sweet	1
as	1
early	1
grass	1
butter	1
in	1
April.	1
He	1
goes	1
and	1
hunts	1
for	1
his	1
oil,	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
sure	1
of	1
its	1
freshness	1
and	1
genuineness,	1
even	1
as	1
the	1
traveller	1
on	1
the	1
prairie	1
hunts	1
up	1
his	1
own	1
supper	1
of	1
game.	1
CHAPTER	1
98	1
Stowing	1
Down	1
and	1
Clearing	1
Up.	1
Already	1
has	1
it	1
been	1
related	1
how	1
the	1
great	1
leviathan	1
is	1
afar	1
off	1
descried	1
from	1
the	1
mast-head;	1
how	1
he	1
is	1
chased	1
over	1
the	1
watery	1
moors,	1
and	1
slaughtered	1
in	1
the	1
valleys	1
of	1
the	1
deep;	1
how	1
he	1
is	1
then	1
towed	1
alongside	1
and	1
beheaded;	1
and	1
how	1
(on	1
the	1
principle	1
which	1
entitled	1
the	1
headsman	1
of	1
old	1
to	1
the	1
garments	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
beheaded	1
was	1
killed)	1
his	1
great	1
padded	1
surtout	1
becomes	1
the	1
property	1
of	1
his	1
executioner;	1
how,	1
in	1
due	1
time,	1
he	1
is	1
condemned	1
to	1
the	1
pots,	1
and,	1
like	1
Shadrach,	1
Meshach,	1
and	1
Abednego,	1
his	1
spermaceti,	1
oil,	1
and	1
bone	1
pass	1
unscathed	1
through	1
the	1
fire;--but	1
now	1
it	1
remains	1
to	1
conclude	1
the	1
last	1
chapter	1
of	1
this	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
description	1
by	1
rehearsing--singing,	1
if	1
I	1
may--the	1
romantic	1
proceeding	1
of	1
decanting	1
off	1
his	1
oil	1
into	1
the	1
casks	1
and	1
striking	1
them	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
hold,	1
where	1
once	1
again	1
leviathan	1
returns	1
to	1
his	1
native	1
profundities,	1
sliding	1
along	1
beneath	1
the	1
surface	1
as	1
before;	1
but,	1
alas!	1
never	1
more	1
to	1
rise	1
and	1
blow.	1
While	1
still	1
warm,	1
the	1
oil,	1
like	1
hot	1
punch,	1
is	1
received	1
into	1
the	1
six-barrel	1
casks;	1
and	1
while,	1
perhaps,	1
the	1
ship	1
is	1
pitching	1
and	1
rolling	1
this	1
way	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
midnight	1
sea,	1
the	1
enormous	1
casks	1
are	1
slewed	1
round	1
and	1
headed	1
over,	1
end	1
for	1
end,	1
and	1
sometimes	1
perilously	1
scoot	1
across	1
the	1
slippery	1
deck,	1
like	1
so	1
many	1
land	1
slides,	1
till	1
at	1
last	1
man-handled	1
and	1
stayed	1
in	1
their	1
course;	1
and	1
all	1
round	1
the	1
hoops,	1
rap,	1
rap,	1
go	1
as	1
many	1
hammers	1
as	1
can	1
play	1
upon	1
them,	1
for	1
now,	1
EX	1
OFFICIO,	1
every	1
sailor	1
is	1
a	1
cooper.	1
At	1
length,	1
when	1
the	1
last	1
pint	1
is	1
casked,	1
and	1
all	1
is	1
cool,	1
then	1
the	1
great	1
hatchways	1
are	1
unsealed,	1
the	1
bowels	1
of	1
the	1
ship	1
are	1
thrown	1
open,	1
and	1
down	1
go	1
the	1
casks	1
to	1
their	1
final	1
rest	1
in	1
the	1
sea.	1
This	1
done,	1
the	1
hatches	1
are	1
replaced,	1
and	1
hermetically	1
closed,	1
like	1
a	1
closet	1
walled	1
up.	1
In	1
the	1
sperm	1
fishery,	1
this	1
is	1
perhaps	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
remarkable	1
incidents	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
business	1
of	1
whaling.	1
One	1
day	1
the	1
planks	1
stream	1
with	1
freshets	1
of	1
blood	1
and	1
oil;	1
on	1
the	1
sacred	1
quarter-deck	1
enormous	1
masses	1
of	1
the	1
whale's	1
head	1
are	1
profanely	1
piled;	1
great	1
rusty	1
casks	1
lie	1
about,	1
as	1
in	1
a	1
brewery	1
yard;	1
the	1
smoke	1
from	1
the	1
try-works	1
has	1
besooted	1
all	1
the	1
bulwarks;	1
the	1
mariners	1
go	1
about	1
suffused	1
with	1
unctuousness;	1
the	1
entire	1
ship	1
seems	1
great	1
leviathan	1
himself;	1
while	1
on	1
all	1
hands	1
the	1
din	1
is	1
deafening.	1
But	1
a	1
day	1
or	1
two	1
after,	1
you	1
look	1
about	1
you,	1
and	1
prick	1
your	1
ears	1
in	1
this	1
self-same	1
ship;	1
and	1
were	1
it	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
tell-tale	1
boats	1
and	1
try-works,	1
you	1
would	1
all	1
but	1
swear	1
you	1
trod	1
some	1
silent	1
merchant	1
vessel,	1
with	1
a	1
most	1
scrupulously	1
neat	1
commander.	1
The	1
unmanufactured	1
sperm	1
oil	1
possesses	1
a	1
singularly	1
cleansing	1
virtue.	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
reason	1
why	1
the	1
decks	1
never	1
look	1
so	1
white	1
as	1
just	1
after	1
what	1
they	1
call	1
an	1
affair	1
of	1
oil.	1
Besides,	1
from	1
the	1
ashes	1
of	1
the	1
burned	1
scraps	1
of	1
the	1
whale,	1
a	1
potent	1
lye	1
is	1
readily	1
made;	1
and	1
whenever	1
any	1
adhesiveness	1
from	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
the	1
whale	1
remains	1
clinging	1
to	1
the	1
side,	1
that	1
lye	1
quickly	1
exterminates	1
it.	1
Hands	1
go	1
diligently	1
along	1
the	1
bulwarks,	1
and	1
with	1
buckets	1
of	1
water	1
and	1
rags	1
restore	1
them	1
to	1
their	1
full	1
tidiness.	1
The	1
soot	1
is	1
brushed	1
from	1
the	1
lower	1
rigging.	1
All	1
the	1
numerous	1
implements	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
use	1
are	1
likewise	1
faithfully	1
cleansed	1
and	1
put	1
away.	1
The	1
great	1
hatch	1
is	1
scrubbed	1
and	1
placed	1
upon	1
the	1
try-works,	1
completely	1
hiding	1
the	1
pots;	1
every	1
cask	1
is	1
out	1
of	1
sight;	1
all	1
tackles	1
are	1
coiled	1
in	1
unseen	1
nooks;	1
and	1
when	1
by	1
the	1
combined	1
and	1
simultaneous	1
industry	1
of	1
almost	1
the	1
entire	1
ship's	1
company,	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
this	1
conscientious	1
duty	1
is	1
at	1
last	1
concluded,	1
then	1
the	1
crew	1
themselves	1
proceed	1
to	1
their	1
own	1
ablutions;	1
shift	1
themselves	1
from	1
top	1
to	1
toe;	1
and	1
finally	1
issue	1
to	1
the	1
immaculate	1
deck,	1
fresh	1
and	1
all	1
aglow,	1
as	1
bridegrooms	1
new-leaped	1
from	1
out	1
the	1
daintiest	1
Holland.	1
Now,	1
with	1
elated	1
step,	1
they	1
pace	1
the	1
planks	1
in	1
twos	1
and	1
threes,	1
and	1
humorously	1
discourse	1
of	1
parlors,	1
sofas,	1
carpets,	1
and	1
fine	1
cambrics;	1
propose	1
to	1
mat	1
the	1
deck;	1
think	1
of	1
having	1
hanging	1
to	1
the	1
top;	1
object	1
not	1
to	1
taking	1
tea	1
by	1
moonlight	1
on	1
the	1
piazza	1
of	1
the	1
forecastle.	1
To	1
hint	1
to	1
such	1
musked	1
mariners	1
of	1
oil,	1
and	1
bone,	1
and	1
blubber,	1
were	1
little	1
short	1
of	1
audacity.	1
They	1
know	1
not	1
the	1
thing	1
you	1
distantly	1
allude	1
to.	1
Away,	1
and	1
bring	1
us	1
napkins!	1
But	1
mark:	1
aloft	1
there,	1
at	1
the	1
three	1
mast	1
heads,	1
stand	1
three	1
men	1
intent	1
on	1
spying	1
out	1
more	1
whales,	1
which,	1
if	1
caught,	1
infallibly	1
will	1
again	1
soil	1
the	1
old	1
oaken	1
furniture,	1
and	1
drop	1
at	1
least	1
one	1
small	1
grease-spot	1
somewhere.	1
Yes;	1
and	1
many	1
is	1
the	1
time,	1
when,	1
after	1
the	1
severest	1
uninterrupted	1
labors,	1
which	1
know	1
no	1
night;	1
continuing	1
straight	1
through	1
for	1
ninety-six	1
hours;	1
when	1
from	1
the	1
boat,	1
where	1
they	1
have	1
swelled	1
their	1
wrists	1
with	1
all	1
day	1
rowing	1
on	1
the	1
Line,--they	1
only	1
step	1
to	1
the	1
deck	1
to	1
carry	1
vast	1
chains,	1
and	1
heave	1
the	1
heavy	1
windlass,	1
and	1
cut	1
and	1
slash,	1
yea,	1
and	1
in	1
their	1
very	1
sweatings	1
to	1
be	1
smoked	1
and	1
burned	1
anew	1
by	1
the	1
combined	1
fires	1
of	1
the	1
equatorial	1
sun	1
and	1
the	1
equatorial	1
try-works;	1
when,	1
on	1
the	1
heel	1
of	1
all	1
this,	1
they	1
have	1
finally	1
bestirred	1
themselves	1
to	1
cleanse	1
the	1
ship,	1
and	1
make	1
a	1
spotless	1
dairy	1
room	1
of	1
it;	1
many	1
is	1
the	1
time	1
the	1
poor	1
fellows,	1
just	1
buttoning	1
the	1
necks	1
of	1
their	1
clean	1
frocks,	1
are	1
startled	1
by	1
the	1
cry	1
of	1
"There	1
she	1
blows!"	1
and	1
away	1
they	1
fly	1
to	1
fight	1
another	1
whale,	1
and	1
go	1
through	1
the	1
whole	1
weary	1
thing	1
again.	1
Oh!	1
my	1
friends,	1
but	1
this	1
is	1
man-killing!	1
Yet	1
this	1
is	1
life.	1
For	1
hardly	1
have	1
we	1
mortals	1
by	1
long	1
toilings	1
extracted	1
from	1
this	1
world's	1
vast	1
bulk	1
its	1
small	1
but	1
valuable	1
sperm;	1
and	1
then,	1
with	1
weary	1
patience,	1
cleansed	1
ourselves	1
from	1
its	1
defilements,	1
and	1
learned	1
to	1
live	1
here	1
in	1
clean	1
tabernacles	1
of	1
the	1
soul;	1
hardly	1
is	1
this	1
done,	1
when--THERE	1
SHE	1
BLOWS!--the	1
ghost	1
is	1
spouted	1
up,	1
and	1
away	1
we	1
sail	1
to	1
fight	1
some	1
other	1
world,	1
and	1
go	1
through	1
young	1
life's	1
old	1
routine	1
again.	1
Oh!	1
the	1
metempsychosis!	1
Oh!	1
Pythagoras,	1
that	1
in	1
bright	1
Greece,	1
two	1
thousand	1
years	1
ago,	1
did	1
die,	1
so	1
good,	1
so	1
wise,	1
so	1
mild;	1
I	1
sailed	1
with	1
thee	1
along	1
the	1
Peruvian	1
coast	1
last	1
voyage--and,	1
foolish	1
as	1
I	1
am,	1
taught	1
thee,	1
a	1
green	1
simple	1
boy,	1
how	1
to	1
splice	1
a	1
rope!	1
CHAPTER	1
99	1
The	1
Doubloon.	1
Ere	1
now	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
related	1
how	1
Ahab	1
was	1
wont	1
to	1
pace	1
his	1
quarter-deck,	1
taking	1
regular	1
turns	1
at	1
either	1
limit,	1
the	1
binnacle	1
and	1
mainmast;	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
multiplicity	1
of	1
other	1
things	1
requiring	1
narration	1
it	1
has	1
not	1
been	1
added	1
how	1
that	1
sometimes	1
in	1
these	1
walks,	1
when	1
most	1
plunged	1
in	1
his	1
mood,	1
he	1
was	1
wont	1
to	1
pause	1
in	1
turn	1
at	1
each	1
spot,	1
and	1
stand	1
there	1
strangely	1
eyeing	1
the	1
particular	1
object	1
before	1
him.	1
When	1
he	1
halted	1
before	1
the	1
binnacle,	1
with	1
his	1
glance	1
fastened	1
on	1
the	1
pointed	1
needle	1
in	1
the	1
compass,	1
that	1
glance	1
shot	1
like	1
a	1
javelin	1
with	1
the	1
pointed	1
intensity	1
of	1
his	1
purpose;	1
and	1
when	1
resuming	1
his	1
walk	1
he	1
again	1
paused	1
before	1
the	1
mainmast,	1
then,	1
as	1
the	1
same	1
riveted	1
glance	1
fastened	1
upon	1
the	1
riveted	1
gold	1
coin	1
there,	1
he	1
still	1
wore	1
the	1
same	1
aspect	1
of	1
nailed	1
firmness,	1
only	1
dashed	1
with	1
a	1
certain	1
wild	1
longing,	1
if	1
not	1
hopefulness.	1
But	1
one	1
morning,	1
turning	1
to	1
pass	1
the	1
doubloon,	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
newly	1
attracted	1
by	1
the	1
strange	1
figures	1
and	1
inscriptions	1
stamped	1
on	1
it,	1
as	1
though	1
now	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
beginning	1
to	1
interpret	1
for	1
himself	1
in	1
some	1
monomaniac	1
way	1
whatever	1
significance	1
might	1
lurk	1
in	1
them.	1
And	1
some	1
certain	1
significance	1
lurks	1
in	1
all	1
things,	1
else	1
all	1
things	1
are	1
little	1
worth,	1
and	1
the	1
round	1
world	1
itself	1
but	1
an	1
empty	1
cipher,	1
except	1
to	1
sell	1
by	1
the	1
cartload,	1
as	1
they	1
do	1
hills	1
about	1
Boston,	1
to	1
fill	1
up	1
some	1
morass	1
in	1
the	1
Milky	1
Way.	1
Now	1
this	1
doubloon	1
was	1
of	1
purest,	1
virgin	1
gold,	1
raked	1
somewhere	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
gorgeous	1
hills,	1
whence,	1
east	1
and	1
west,	1
over	1
golden	1
sands,	1
the	1
head-waters	1
of	1
many	1
a	1
Pactolus	1
flows.	1
And	1
though	1
now	1
nailed	1
amidst	1
all	1
the	1
rustiness	1
of	1
iron	1
bolts	1
and	1
the	1
verdigris	1
of	1
copper	1
spikes,	1
yet,	1
untouchable	1
and	1
immaculate	1
to	1
any	1
foulness,	1
it	1
still	1
preserved	1
its	1
Quito	1
glow.	1
Nor,	1
though	1
placed	1
amongst	1
a	1
ruthless	1
crew	1
and	1
every	1
hour	1
passed	1
by	1
ruthless	1
hands,	1
and	1
through	1
the	1
livelong	1
nights	1
shrouded	1
with	1
thick	1
darkness	1
which	1
might	1
cover	1
any	1
pilfering	1
approach,	1
nevertheless	1
every	1
sunrise	1
found	1
the	1
doubloon	1
where	1
the	1
sunset	1
left	1
it	1
last.	1
For	1
it	1
was	1
set	1
apart	1
and	1
sanctified	1
to	1
one	1
awe-striking	1
end;	1
and	1
however	1
wanton	1
in	1
their	1
sailor	1
ways,	1
one	1
and	1
all,	1
the	1
mariners	1
revered	1
it	1
as	1
the	1
white	1
whale's	1
talisman.	1
Sometimes	1
they	1
talked	1
it	1
over	1
in	1
the	1
weary	1
watch	1
by	1
night,	1
wondering	1
whose	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
last,	1
and	1
whether	1
he	1
would	1
ever	1
live	1
to	1
spend	1
it.	1
Now	1
those	1
noble	1
golden	1
coins	1
of	1
South	1
America	1
are	1
as	1
medals	1
of	1
the	1
sun	1
and	1
tropic	1
token-pieces.	1
Here	1
palms,	1
alpacas,	1
and	1
volcanoes;	1
sun's	1
disks	1
and	1
stars;	1
ecliptics,	1
horns-of-plenty,	1
and	1
rich	1
banners	1
waving,	1
are	1
in	1
luxuriant	1
profusion	1
stamped;	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
precious	1
gold	1
seems	1
almost	1
to	1
derive	1
an	1
added	1
preciousness	1
and	1
enhancing	1
glories,	1
by	1
passing	1
through	1
those	1
fancy	1
mints,	1
so	1
Spanishly	1
poetic.	1
It	1
so	1
chanced	1
that	1
the	1
doubloon	1
of	1
the	1
Pequod	1
was	1
a	1
most	1
wealthy	1
example	1
of	1
these	1
things.	1
On	1
its	1
round	1
border	1
it	1
bore	1
the	1
letters,	1
REPUBLICA	1
DEL	1
ECUADOR:	1
QUITO.	1
So	1
this	1
bright	1
coin	1
came	1
from	1
a	1
country	1
planted	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
beneath	1
the	1
great	1
equator,	1
and	1
named	1
after	1
it;	1
and	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
cast	1
midway	1
up	1
the	1
Andes,	1
in	1
the	1
unwaning	1
clime	1
that	1
knows	1
no	1
autumn.	1
Zoned	1
by	1
those	1
letters	1
you	1
saw	1
the	1
likeness	1
of	1
three	1
Andes'	1
summits;	1
from	1
one	1
a	1
flame;	1
a	1
tower	1
on	1
another;	1
on	1
the	1
third	1
a	1
crowing	1
cock;	1
while	1
arching	1
over	1
all	1
was	1
a	1
segment	1
of	1
the	1
partitioned	1
zodiac,	1
the	1
signs	1
all	1
marked	1
with	1
their	1
usual	1
cabalistics,	1
and	1
the	1
keystone	1
sun	1
entering	1
the	1
equinoctial	1
point	1
at	1
Libra.	1
Before	1
this	1
equatorial	1
coin,	1
Ahab,	1
not	1
unobserved	1
by	1
others,	1
was	1
now	1
pausing.	1
"There's	1
something	1
ever	1
egotistical	1
in	1
mountain-tops	1
and	1
towers,	1
and	1
all	1
other	1
grand	1
and	1
lofty	1
things;	1
look	1
here,--three	1
peaks	1
as	1
proud	1
as	1
Lucifer.	1
The	1
firm	1
tower,	1
that	1
is	1
Ahab;	1
the	1
volcano,	1
that	1
is	1
Ahab;	1
the	1
courageous,	1
the	1
undaunted,	1
and	1
victorious	1
fowl,	1
that,	1
too,	1
is	1
Ahab;	1
all	1
are	1
Ahab;	1
and	1
this	1
round	1
gold	1
is	1
but	1
the	1
image	1
of	1
the	1
rounder	1
globe,	1
which,	1
like	1
a	1
magician's	1
glass,	1
to	1
each	1
and	1
every	1
man	1
in	1
turn	1
but	1
mirrors	1
back	1
his	1
own	1
mysterious	1
self.	1
Great	1
pains,	1
small	1
gains	1
for	1
those	1
who	1
ask	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
solve	1
them;	1
it	1
cannot	1
solve	1
itself.	1
Methinks	1
now	1
this	1
coined	1
sun	1
wears	1
a	1
ruddy	1
face;	1
but	1
see!	1
aye,	1
he	1
enters	1
the	1
sign	1
of	1
storms,	1
the	1
equinox!	1
and	1
but	1
six	1
months	1
before	1
he	1
wheeled	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
former	1
equinox	1
at	1
Aries!	1
From	1
storm	1
to	1
storm!	1
So	1
be	1
it,	1
then.	1
Born	1
in	1
throes,	1
't	1
is	1
fit	1
that	1
man	1
should	1
live	1
in	1
pains	1
and	1
die	1
in	1
pangs!	1
So	1
be	1
it,	1
then!	1
Here's	1
stout	1
stuff	1
for	1
woe	1
to	1
work	1
on.	1
So	1
be	1
it,	1
then."	1
"No	1
fairy	1
fingers	1
can	1
have	1
pressed	1
the	1
gold,	1
but	1
devil's	1
claws	1
must	1
have	1
left	1
their	1
mouldings	1
there	1
since	1
yesterday,"	1
murmured	1
Starbuck	1
to	1
himself,	1
leaning	1
against	1
the	1
bulwarks.	1
"The	1
old	1
man	1
seems	1
to	1
read	1
Belshazzar's	1
awful	1
writing.	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
marked	1
the	1
coin	1
inspectingly.	1
He	1
goes	1
below;	1
let	1
me	1
read.	1
A	1
dark	1
valley	1
between	1
three	1
mighty,	1
heaven-abiding	1
peaks,	1
that	1
almost	1
seem	1
the	1
Trinity,	1
in	1
some	1
faint	1
earthly	1
symbol.	1
So	1
in	1
this	1
vale	1
of	1
Death,	1
God	1
girds	1
us	1
round;	1
and	1
over	1
all	1
our	1
gloom,	1
the	1
sun	1
of	1
Righteousness	1
still	1
shines	1
a	1
beacon	1
and	1
a	1
hope.	1
If	1
we	1
bend	1
down	1
our	1
eyes,	1
the	1
dark	1
vale	1
shows	1
her	1
mouldy	1
soil;	1
but	1
if	1
we	1
lift	1
them,	1
the	1
bright	1
sun	1
meets	1
our	1
glance	1
half	1
way,	1
to	1
cheer.	1
Yet,	1
oh,	1
the	1
great	1
sun	1
is	1
no	1
fixture;	1
and	1
if,	1
at	1
midnight,	1
we	1
would	1
fain	1
snatch	1
some	1
sweet	1
solace	1
from	1
him,	1
we	1
gaze	1
for	1
him	1
in	1
vain!	1
This	1
coin	1
speaks	1
wisely,	1
mildly,	1
truly,	1
but	1
still	1
sadly	1
to	1
me.	1
I	1
will	1
quit	1
it,	1
lest	1
Truth	1
shake	1
me	1
falsely."	1
"There	1
now's	1
the	1
old	1
Mogul,"	1
soliloquized	1
Stubb	1
by	1
the	1
try-works,	1
"he's	1
been	1
twigging	1
it;	1
and	1
there	1
goes	1
Starbuck	1
from	1
the	1
same,	1
and	1
both	1
with	1
faces	1
which	1
I	1
should	1
say	1
might	1
be	1
somewhere	1
within	1
nine	1
fathoms	1
long.	1
And	1
all	1
from	1
looking	1
at	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
gold,	1
which	1
did	1
I	1
have	1
it	1
now	1
on	1
Negro	1
Hill	1
or	1
in	1
Corlaer's	1
Hook,	1
I'd	1
not	1
look	1
at	1
it	1
very	1
long	1
ere	1
spending	1
it.	1
Humph!	1
in	1
my	1
poor,	1
insignificant	1
opinion,	1
I	1
regard	1
this	1
as	1
queer.	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
doubloons	1
before	1
now	1
in	1
my	1
voyagings;	1
your	1
doubloons	1
of	1
old	1
Spain,	1
your	1
doubloons	1
of	1
Peru,	1
your	1
doubloons	1
of	1
Chili,	1
your	1
doubloons	1
of	1
Bolivia,	1
your	1
doubloons	1
of	1
Popayan;	1
with	1
plenty	1
of	1
gold	1
moidores	1
and	1
pistoles,	1
and	1
joes,	1
and	1
half	1
joes,	1
and	1
quarter	1
joes.	1
What	1
then	1
should	1
there	1
be	1
in	1
this	1
doubloon	1
of	1
the	1
Equator	1
that	1
is	1
so	1
killing	1
wonderful?	1
By	1
Golconda!	1
let	1
me	1
read	1
it	1
once.	1
Halloa!	1
here's	1
signs	1
and	1
wonders	1
truly!	1
That,	1
now,	1
is	1
what	1
old	1
Bowditch	1
in	1
his	1
Epitome	1
calls	1
the	1
zodiac,	1
and	1
what	1
my	1
almanac	1
below	1
calls	1
ditto.	1
I'll	1
get	1
the	1
almanac	1
and	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
devils	1
can	1
be	1
raised	1
with	1
Daboll's	1
arithmetic,	1
I'll	1
try	1
my	1
hand	1
at	1
raising	1
a	1
meaning	1
out	1
of	1
these	1
queer	1
curvicues	1
here	1
with	1
the	1
Massachusetts	1
calendar.	1
Here's	1
the	1
book.	1
Let's	1
see	1
now.	1
Signs	1
and	1
wonders;	1
and	1
the	1
sun,	1
he's	1
always	1
among	1
'em.	1
Hem,	1
hem,	1
hem;	1
here	1
they	1
are--here	1
they	1
go--all	1
alive:--Aries,	1
or	1
the	1
Ram;	1
Taurus,	1
or	1
the	1
Bull	1
and	1
Jimimi!	1
here's	1
Gemini	1
himself,	1
or	1
the	1
Twins.	1
Well;	1
the	1
sun	1
he	1
wheels	1
among	1
'em.	1
Aye,	1
here	1
on	1
the	1
coin	1
he's	1
just	1
crossing	1
the	1
threshold	1
between	1
two	1
of	1
twelve	1
sitting-rooms	1
all	1
in	1
a	1
ring.	1
Book!	1
you	1
lie	1
there;	1
the	1
fact	1
is,	1
you	1
books	1
must	1
know	1
your	1
places.	1
You'll	1
do	1
to	1
give	1
us	1
the	1
bare	1
words	1
and	1
facts,	1
but	1
we	1
come	1
in	1
to	1
supply	1
the	1
thoughts.	1
That's	1
my	1
small	1
experience,	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
the	1
Massachusetts	1
calendar,	1
and	1
Bowditch's	1
navigator,	1
and	1
Daboll's	1
arithmetic	1
go.	1
Signs	1
and	1
wonders,	1
eh?	1
Pity	1
if	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
wonderful	1
in	1
signs,	1
and	1
significant	1
in	1
wonders!	1
There's	1
a	1
clue	1
somewhere;	1
wait	1
a	1
bit;	1
hist--hark!	1
By	1
Jove,	1
I	1
have	1
it!	1
Look	1
you,	1
Doubloon,	1
your	1
zodiac	1
here	1
is	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
man	1
in	1
one	1
round	1
chapter;	1
and	1
now	1
I'll	1
read	1
it	1
off,	1
straight	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
book.	1
Come,	1
Almanack!	1
To	1
begin:	1
there's	1
Aries,	1
or	1
the	1
Ram--lecherous	1
dog,	1
he	1
begets	1
us;	1
then,	1
Taurus,	1
or	1
the	1
Bull--he	1
bumps	1
us	1
the	1
first	1
thing;	1
then	1
Gemini,	1
or	1
the	1
Twins--that	1
is,	1
Virtue	1
and	1
Vice;	1
we	1
try	1
to	1
reach	1
Virtue,	1
when	1
lo!	1
comes	1
Cancer	1
the	1
Crab,	1
and	1
drags	1
us	1
back;	1
and	1
here,	1
going	1
from	1
Virtue,	1
Leo,	1
a	1
roaring	1
Lion,	1
lies	1
in	1
the	1
path--he	1
gives	1
a	1
few	1
fierce	1
bites	1
and	1
surly	1
dabs	1
with	1
his	1
paw;	1
we	1
escape,	1
and	1
hail	1
Virgo,	1
the	1
Virgin!	1
that's	1
our	1
first	1
love;	1
we	1
marry	1
and	1
think	1
to	1
be	1
happy	1
for	1
aye,	1
when	1
pop	1
comes	1
Libra,	1
or	1
the	1
Scales--happiness	1
weighed	1
and	1
found	1
wanting;	1
and	1
while	1
we	1
are	1
very	1
sad	1
about	1
that,	1
Lord!	1
how	1
we	1
suddenly	1
jump,	1
as	1
Scorpio,	1
or	1
the	1
Scorpion,	1
stings	1
us	1
in	1
the	1
rear;	1
we	1
are	1
curing	1
the	1
wound,	1
when	1
whang	1
come	1
the	1
arrows	1
all	1
round;	1
Sagittarius,	1
or	1
the	1
Archer,	1
is	1
amusing	1
himself.	1
As	1
we	1
pluck	1
out	1
the	1
shafts,	1
stand	1
aside!	1
here's	1
the	1
battering-ram,	1
Capricornus,	1
or	1
the	1
Goat;	1
full	1
tilt,	1
he	1
comes	1
rushing,	1
and	1
headlong	1
we	1
are	1
tossed;	1
when	1
Aquarius,	1
or	1
the	1
Water-bearer,	1
pours	1
out	1
his	1
whole	1
deluge	1
and	1
drowns	1
us;	1
and	1
to	1
wind	1
up	1
with	1
Pisces,	1
or	1
the	1
Fishes,	1
we	1
sleep.	1
There's	1
a	1
sermon	1
now,	1
writ	1
in	1
high	1
heaven,	1
and	1
the	1
sun	1
goes	1
through	1
it	1
every	1
year,	1
and	1
yet	1
comes	1
out	1
of	1
it	1
all	1
alive	1
and	1
hearty.	1
Jollily	1
he,	1
aloft	1
there,	1
wheels	1
through	1
toil	1
and	1
trouble;	1
and	1
so,	1
alow	1
here,	1
does	1
jolly	1
Stubb.	1
Oh,	1
jolly's	1
the	1
word	1
for	1
aye!	1
Adieu,	1
Doubloon!	1
But	1
stop;	1
here	1
comes	1
little	1
King-Post;	1
dodge	1
round	1
the	1
try-works,	1
now,	1
and	1
let's	1
hear	1
what	1
he'll	1
have	1
to	1
say.	1
There;	1
he's	1
before	1
it;	1
he'll	1
out	1
with	1
something	1
presently.	1
So,	1
so;	1
he's	1
beginning."	1
"I	1
see	1
nothing	1
here,	1
but	1
a	1
round	1
thing	1
made	1
of	1
gold,	1
and	1
whoever	1
raises	1
a	1
certain	1
whale,	1
this	1
round	1
thing	1
belongs	1
to	1
him.	1
So,	1
what's	1
all	1
this	1
staring	1
been	1
about?	1
It	1
is	1
worth	1
sixteen	1
dollars,	1
that's	1
true;	1
and	1
at	1
two	1
cents	1
the	1
cigar,	1
that's	1
nine	1
hundred	1
and	1
sixty	1
cigars.	1
I	1
won't	1
smoke	1
dirty	1
pipes	1
like	1
Stubb,	1
but	1
I	1
like	1
cigars,	1
and	1
here's	1
nine	1
hundred	1
and	1
sixty	1
of	1
them;	1
so	1
here	1
goes	1
Flask	1
aloft	1
to	1
spy	1
'em	1
out."	1
"Shall	1
I	1
call	1
that	1
wise	1
or	1
foolish,	1
now;	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
really	1
wise	1
it	1
has	1
a	1
foolish	1
look	1
to	1
it;	1
yet,	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
really	1
foolish,	1
then	1
has	1
it	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
wiseish	1
look	1
to	1
it.	1
But,	1
avast;	1
here	1
comes	1
our	1
old	1
Manxman--the	1
old	1
hearse-driver,	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
been,	1
that	1
is,	1
before	1
he	1
took	1
to	1
the	1
sea.	1
He	1
luffs	1
up	1
before	1
the	1
doubloon;	1
halloa,	1
and	1
goes	1
round	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
mast;	1
why,	1
there's	1
a	1
horse-shoe	1
nailed	1
on	1
that	1
side;	1
and	1
now	1
he's	1
back	1
again;	1
what	1
does	1
that	1
mean?	1
Hark!	1
he's	1
muttering--voice	1
like	1
an	1
old	1
worn-out	1
coffee-mill.	1
Prick	1
ears,	1
and	1
listen!"	1
"If	1
the	1
White	1
Whale	1
be	1
raised,	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
in	1
a	1
month	1
and	1
a	1
day,	1
when	1
the	1
sun	1
stands	1
in	1
some	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
signs.	1
I've	1
studied	1
signs,	1
and	1
know	1
their	1
marks;	1
they	1
were	1
taught	1
me	1
two	1
score	1
years	1
ago,	1
by	1
the	1
old	1
witch	1
in	1
Copenhagen.	1
Now,	1
in	1
what	1
sign	1
will	1
the	1
sun	1
then	1
be?	1
The	1
horse-shoe	1
sign;	1
for	1
there	1
it	1
is,	1
right	1
opposite	1
the	1
gold.	1
And	1
what's	1
the	1
horse-shoe	1
sign?	1
The	1
lion	1
is	1
the	1
horse-shoe	1
sign--the	1
roaring	1
and	1
devouring	1
lion.	1
Ship,	1
old	1
ship!	1
my	1
old	1
head	1
shakes	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
thee."	1
"There's	1
another	1
rendering	1
now;	1
but	1
still	1
one	1
text.	1
All	1
sorts	1
of	1
men	1
in	1
one	1
kind	1
of	1
world,	1
you	1
see.	1
Dodge	1
again!	1
here	1
comes	1
Queequeg--all	1
tattooing--looks	1
like	1
the	1
signs	1
of	1
the	1
Zodiac	1
himself.	1
What	1
says	1
the	1
Cannibal?	1
As	1
I	1
live	1
he's	1
comparing	1
notes;	1
looking	1
at	1
his	1
thigh	1
bone;	1
thinks	1
the	1
sun	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
thigh,	1
or	1
in	1
the	1
calf,	1
or	1
in	1
the	1
bowels,	1
I	1
suppose,	1
as	1
the	1
old	1
women	1
talk	1
Surgeon's	1
Astronomy	1
in	1
the	1
back	1
country.	1
And	1
by	1
Jove,	1
he's	1
found	1
something	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
vicinity	1
of	1
his	1
thigh--I	1
guess	1
it's	1
Sagittarius,	1
or	1
the	1
Archer.	1
No:	1
he	1
don't	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
make	1
of	1
the	1
doubloon;	1
he	1
takes	1
it	1
for	1
an	1
old	1
button	1
off	1
some	1
king's	1
trowsers.	1
But,	1
aside	1
again!	1
here	1
comes	1
that	1
ghost-devil,	1
Fedallah;	1
tail	1
coiled	1
out	1
of	1
sight	1
as	1
usual,	1
oakum	1
in	1
the	1
toes	1
of	1
his	1
pumps	1
as	1
usual.	1
What	1
does	1
he	1
say,	1
with	1
that	1
look	1
of	1
his?	1
Ah,	1
only	1
makes	1
a	1
sign	1
to	1
the	1
sign	1
and	1
bows	1
himself;	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
sun	1
on	1
the	1
coin--fire	1
worshipper,	1
depend	1
upon	1
it.	1
Ho!	1
more	1
and	1
more.	1
This	1
way	1
comes	1
Pip--poor	1
boy!	1
would	1
he	1
had	1
died,	1
or	1
I;	1
he's	1
half	1
horrible	1
to	1
me.	1
He	1
too	1
has	1
been	1
watching	1
all	1
of	1
these	1
interpreters--myself	1
included--and	1
look	1
now,	1
he	1
comes	1
to	1
read,	1
with	1
that	1
unearthly	1
idiot	1
face.	1
Stand	1
away	1
again	1
and	1
hear	1
him.	1
Hark!"	1
"I	1
look,	1
you	1
look,	1
he	1
looks;	1
we	1
look,	1
ye	1
look,	1
they	1
look."	1
"Upon	1
my	1
soul,	1
he's	1
been	1
studying	1
Murray's	1
Grammar!	1
Improving	1
his	1
mind,	1
poor	1
fellow!	1
But	1
what's	1
that	1
he	1
says	1
now--hist!"	1
"I	1
look,	1
you	1
look,	1
he	1
looks;	1
we	1
look,	1
ye	1
look,	1
they	1
look."	1
"Why,	1
he's	1
getting	1
it	1
by	1
heart--hist!	1
again."	1
"I	1
look,	1
you	1
look,	1
he	1
looks;	1
we	1
look,	1
ye	1
look,	1
they	1
look."	1
"Well,	1
that's	1
funny."	1
"And	1
I,	1
you,	1
and	1
he;	1
and	1
we,	1
ye,	1
and	1
they,	1
are	1
all	1
bats;	1
and	1
I'm	1
a	1
crow,	1
especially	1
when	1
I	1
stand	1
a'top	1
of	1
this	1
pine	1
tree	1
here.	1
Caw!	1
caw!	1
caw!	1
caw!	1
caw!	1
caw!	1
Ain't	1
I	1
a	1
crow?	1
And	1
where's	1
the	1
scare-crow?	1
There	1
he	1
stands;	1
two	1
bones	1
stuck	1
into	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
old	1
trowsers,	1
and	1
two	1
more	1
poked	1
into	1
the	1
sleeves	1
of	1
an	1
old	1
jacket."	1
"Wonder	1
if	1
he	1
means	1
me?--complimentary!--poor	1
lad!--I	1
could	1
go	1
hang	1
myself.	1
Any	1
way,	1
for	1
the	1
present,	1
I'll	1
quit	1
Pip's	1
vicinity.	1
I	1
can	1
stand	1
the	1
rest,	1
for	1
they	1
have	1
plain	1
wits;	1
but	1
he's	1
too	1
crazy-witty	1
for	1
my	1
sanity.	1
So,	1
so,	1
I	1
leave	1
him	1
muttering."	1
"Here's	1
the	1
ship's	1
navel,	1
this	1
doubloon	1
here,	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
all	1
on	1
fire	1
to	1
unscrew	1
it.	1
But,	1
unscrew	1
your	1
navel,	1
and	1
what's	1
the	1
consequence?	1
Then	1
again,	1
if	1
it	1
stays	1
here,	1
that	1
is	1
ugly,	1
too,	1
for	1
when	1
aught's	1
nailed	1
to	1
the	1
mast	1
it's	1
a	1
sign	1
that	1
things	1
grow	1
desperate.	1
Ha,	1
ha!	1
old	1
Ahab!	1
the	1
White	1
Whale;	1
he'll	1
nail	1
ye!	1
This	1
is	1
a	1
pine	1
tree.	1
My	1
father,	1
in	1
old	1
Tolland	1
county,	1
cut	1
down	1
a	1
pine	1
tree	1
once,	1
and	1
found	1
a	1
silver	1
ring	1
grown	1
over	1
in	1
it;	1
some	1
old	1
darkey's	1
wedding	1
ring.	1
How	1
did	1
it	1
get	1
there?	1
And	1
so	1
they'll	1
say	1
in	1
the	1
resurrection,	1
when	1
they	1
come	1
to	1
fish	1
up	1
this	1
old	1
mast,	1
and	1
find	1
a	1
doubloon	1
lodged	1
in	1
it,	1
with	1
bedded	1
oysters	1
for	1
the	1
shaggy	1
bark.	1
Oh,	1
the	1
gold!	1
the	1
precious,	1
precious,	1
gold!	1
the	1
green	1
miser'll	1
hoard	1
ye	1
soon!	1
Hish!	1
hish!	1
God	1
goes	1
'mong	1
the	1
worlds	1
blackberrying.	1
Cook!	1
ho,	1
cook!	1
and	1
cook	1
us!	1
Jenny!	1
hey,	1
hey,	1
hey,	1
hey,	1
hey,	1
Jenny,	1
Jenny!	1
and	1
get	1
your	1
hoe-cake	1
done!"	1
CHAPTER	1
100	1
Leg	1
and	1
Arm.	1
The	1
Pequod,	1
of	1
Nantucket,	1
Meets	1
the	1
Samuel	1
Enderby,	1
of	1
London.	1
"Ship,	1
ahoy!	1
Hast	1
seen	1
the	1
White	1
Whale?"	1
So	1
cried	1
Ahab,	1
once	1
more	1
hailing	1
a	1
ship	1
showing	1
English	1
colours,	1
bearing	1
down	1
under	1
the	1
stern.	1
Trumpet	1
to	1
mouth,	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
was	1
standing	1
in	1
his	1
hoisted	1
quarter-boat,	1
his	1
ivory	1
leg	1
plainly	1
revealed	1
to	1
the	1
stranger	1
captain,	1
who	1
was	1
carelessly	1
reclining	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
boat's	1
bow.	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
darkly-tanned,	1
burly,	1
good-natured,	1
fine-looking	1
man,	1
of	1
sixty	1
or	1
thereabouts,	1
dressed	1
in	1
a	1
spacious	1
roundabout,	1
that	1
hung	1
round	1
him	1
in	1
festoons	1
of	1
blue	1
pilot-cloth;	1
and	1
one	1
empty	1
arm	1
of	1
this	1
jacket	1
streamed	1
behind	1
him	1
like	1
the	1
broidered	1
arm	1
of	1
a	1
hussar's	1
surcoat.	1
"Hast	1
seen	1
the	1
White	1
Whale!"	1
"See	1
you	1
this?"	1
and	1
withdrawing	1
it	1
from	1
the	1
folds	1
that	1
had	1
hidden	1
it,	1
he	1
held	1
up	1
a	1
white	1
arm	1
of	1
sperm	1
whale	1
bone,	1
terminating	1
in	1
a	1
wooden	1
head	1
like	1
a	1
mallet.	1
"Man	1
my	1
boat!"	1
cried	1
Ahab,	1
impetuously,	1
and	1
tossing	1
about	1
the	1
oars	1
near	1
him--"Stand	1
by	1
to	1
lower!"	1
In	1
less	1
than	1
a	1
minute,	1
without	1
quitting	1
his	1
little	1
craft,	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
crew	1
were	1
dropped	1
to	1
the	1
water,	1
and	1
were	1
soon	1
alongside	1
of	1
the	1
stranger.	1
But	1
here	1
a	1
curious	1
difficulty	1
presented	1
itself.	1
In	1
the	1
excitement	1
of	1
the	1
moment,	1
Ahab	1
had	1
forgotten	1
that	1
since	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
his	1
leg	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
once	1
stepped	1
on	1
board	1
of	1
any	1
vessel	1
at	1
sea	1
but	1
his	1
own,	1
and	1
then	1
it	1
was	1
always	1
by	1
an	1
ingenious	1
and	1
very	1
handy	1
mechanical	1
contrivance	1
peculiar	1
to	1
the	1
Pequod,	1
and	1
a	1
thing	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
rigged	1
and	1
shipped	1
in	1
any	1
other	1
vessel	1
at	1
a	1
moment's	1
warning.	1
Now,	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
very	1
easy	1
matter	1
for	1
anybody--except	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
almost	1
hourly	1
used	1
to	1
it,	1
like	1
whalemen--to	1
clamber	1
up	1
a	1
ship's	1
side	1
from	1
a	1
boat	1
on	1
the	1
open	1
sea;	1
for	1
the	1
great	1
swells	1
now	1
lift	1
the	1
boat	1
high	1
up	1
towards	1
the	1
bulwarks,	1
and	1
then	1
instantaneously	1
drop	1
it	1
half	1
way	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
kelson.	1
So,	1
deprived	1
of	1
one	1
leg,	1
and	1
the	1
strange	1
ship	1
of	1
course	1
being	1
altogether	1
unsupplied	1
with	1
the	1
kindly	1
invention,	1
Ahab	1
now	1
found	1
himself	1
abjectly	1
reduced	1
to	1
a	1
clumsy	1
landsman	1
again;	1
hopelessly	1
eyeing	1
the	1
uncertain	1
changeful	1
height	1
he	1
could	1
hardly	1
hope	1
to	1
attain.	1
It	1
has	1
before	1
been	1
hinted,	1
perhaps,	1
that	1
every	1
little	1
untoward	1
circumstance	1
that	1
befell	1
him,	1
and	1
which	1
indirectly	1
sprang	1
from	1
his	1
luckless	1
mishap,	1
almost	1
invariably	1
irritated	1
or	1
exasperated	1
Ahab.	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
present	1
instance,	1
all	1
this	1
was	1
heightened	1
by	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
officers	1
of	1
the	1
strange	1
ship,	1
leaning	1
over	1
the	1
side,	1
by	1
the	1
perpendicular	1
ladder	1
of	1
nailed	1
cleets	1
there,	1
and	1
swinging	1
towards	1
him	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
tastefully-ornamented	1
man-ropes;	1
for	1
at	1
first	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
bethink	1
them	1
that	1
a	1
one-legged	1
man	1
must	1
be	1
too	1
much	1
of	1
a	1
cripple	1
to	1
use	1
their	1
sea	1
bannisters.	1
But	1
this	1
awkwardness	1
only	1
lasted	1
a	1
minute,	1
because	1
the	1
strange	1
captain,	1
observing	1
at	1
a	1
glance	1
how	1
affairs	1
stood,	1
cried	1
out,	1
"I	1
see,	1
I	1
see!--avast	1
heaving	1
there!	1
Jump,	1
boys,	1
and	1
swing	1
over	1
the	1
cutting-tackle."	1
As	1
good	1
luck	1
would	1
have	1
it,	1
they	1
had	1
had	1
a	1
whale	1
alongside	1
a	1
day	1
or	1
two	1
previous,	1
and	1
the	1
great	1
tackles	1
were	1
still	1
aloft,	1
and	1
the	1
massive	1
curved	1
blubber-hook,	1
now	1
clean	1
and	1
dry,	1
was	1
still	1
attached	1
to	1
the	1
end.	1
This	1
was	1
quickly	1
lowered	1
to	1
Ahab,	1
who	1
at	1
once	1
comprehending	1
it	1
all,	1
slid	1
his	1
solitary	1
thigh	1
into	1
the	1
curve	1
of	1
the	1
hook	1
(it	1
was	1
like	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
fluke	1
of	1
an	1
anchor,	1
or	1
the	1
crotch	1
of	1
an	1
apple	1
tree),	1
and	1
then	1
giving	1
the	1
word,	1
held	1
himself	1
fast,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
also	1
helped	1
to	1
hoist	1
his	1
own	1
weight,	1
by	1
pulling	1
hand-over-hand	1
upon	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
running	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
tackle.	1
Soon	1
he	1
was	1
carefully	1
swung	1
inside	1
the	1
high	1
bulwarks,	1
and	1
gently	1
landed	1
upon	1
the	1
capstan	1
head.	1
With	1
his	1
ivory	1
arm	1
frankly	1
thrust	1
forth	1
in	1
welcome,	1
the	1
other	1
captain	1
advanced,	1
and	1
Ahab,	1
putting	1
out	1
his	1
ivory	1
leg,	1
and	1
crossing	1
the	1
ivory	1
arm	1
(like	1
two	1
sword-fish	1
blades)	1
cried	1
out	1
in	1
his	1
walrus	1
way,	1
"Aye,	1
aye,	1
hearty!	1
let	1
us	1
shake	1
bones	1
together!--an	1
arm	1
and	1
a	1
leg!--an	1
arm	1
that	1
never	1
can	1
shrink,	1
d'ye	1
see;	1
and	1
a	1
leg	1
that	1
never	1
can	1
run.	1
Where	1
did'st	1
thou	1
see	1
the	1
White	1
Whale?--how	1
long	1
ago?"	1
"The	1
White	1
Whale,"	1
said	1
the	1
Englishman,	1
pointing	1
his	1
ivory	1
arm	1
towards	1
the	1
East,	1
and	1
taking	1
a	1
rueful	1
sight	1
along	1
it,	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
telescope;	1
"there	1
I	1
saw	1
him,	1
on	1
the	1
Line,	1
last	1
season."	1
"And	1
he	1
took	1
that	1
arm	1
off,	1
did	1
he?"	1
asked	1
Ahab,	1
now	1
sliding	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
capstan,	1
and	1
resting	1
on	1
the	1
Englishman's	1
shoulder,	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
so.	1
"Aye,	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
it,	1
at	1
least;	1
and	1
that	1
leg,	1
too?"	1
"Spin	1
me	1
the	1
yarn,"	1
said	1
Ahab;	1
"how	1
was	1
it?"	1
"It	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
in	1
my	1
life	1
that	1
I	1
ever	1
cruised	1
on	1
the	1
Line,"	1
began	1
the	1
Englishman.	1
"I	1
was	1
ignorant	1
of	1
the	1
White	1
Whale	1
at	1
that	1
time.	1
Well,	1
one	1
day	1
we	1
lowered	1
for	1
a	1
pod	1
of	1
four	1
or	1
five	1
whales,	1
and	1
my	1
boat	1
fastened	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
them;	1
a	1
regular	1
circus	1
horse	1
he	1
was,	1
too,	1
that	1
went	1
milling	1
and	1
milling	1
round	1
so,	1
that	1
my	1
boat's	1
crew	1
could	1
only	1
trim	1
dish,	1
by	1
sitting	1
all	1
their	1
sterns	1
on	1
the	1
outer	1
gunwale.	1
Presently	1
up	1
breaches	1
from	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
a	1
bouncing	1
great	1
whale,	1
with	1
a	1
milky-white	1
head	1
and	1
hump,	1
all	1
crows'	1
feet	1
and	1
wrinkles."	1
"It	1
was	1
he,	1
it	1
was	1
he!"	1
cried	1
Ahab,	1
suddenly	1
letting	1
out	1
his	1
suspended	1
breath.	1
"And	1
harpoons	1
sticking	1
in	1
near	1
his	1
starboard	1
fin."	1
"Aye,	1
aye--they	1
were	1
mine--MY	1
irons,"	1
cried	1
Ahab,	1
exultingly--"but	1
on!"	1
"Give	1
me	1
a	1
chance,	1
then,"	1
said	1
the	1
Englishman,	1
good-humoredly.	1
"Well,	1
this	1
old	1
great-grandfather,	1
with	1
the	1
white	1
head	1
and	1
hump,	1
runs	1
all	1
afoam	1
into	1
the	1
pod,	1
and	1
goes	1
to	1
snapping	1
furiously	1
at	1
my	1
fast-line!	1
"Aye,	1
I	1
see!--wanted	1
to	1
part	1
it;	1
free	1
the	1
fast-fish--an	1
old	1
trick--I	1
know	1
him."	1
"How	1
it	1
was	1
exactly,"	1
continued	1
the	1
one-armed	1
commander,	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
know;	1
but	1
in	1
biting	1
the	1
line,	1
it	1
got	1
foul	1
of	1
his	1
teeth,	1
caught	1
there	1
somehow;	1
but	1
we	1
didn't	1
know	1
it	1
then;	1
so	1
that	1
when	1
we	1
afterwards	1
pulled	1
on	1
the	1
line,	1
bounce	1
we	1
came	1
plump	1
on	1
to	1
his	1
hump!	1
instead	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
whale's;	1
that	1
went	1
off	1
to	1
windward,	1
all	1
fluking.	1
Seeing	1
how	1
matters	1
stood,	1
and	1
what	1
a	1
noble	1
great	1
whale	1
it	1
was--the	1
noblest	1
and	1
biggest	1
I	1
ever	1
saw,	1
sir,	1
in	1
my	1
life--I	1
resolved	1
to	1
capture	1
him,	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
boiling	1
rage	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
in.	1
And	1
thinking	1
the	1
hap-hazard	1
line	1
would	1
get	1
loose,	1
or	1
the	1
tooth	1
it	1
was	1
tangled	1
to	1
might	1
draw	1
(for	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
devil	1
of	1
a	1
boat's	1
crew	1
for	1
a	1
pull	1
on	1
a	1
whale-line);	1
seeing	1
all	1
this,	1
I	1
say,	1
I	1
jumped	1
into	1
my	1
first	1
mate's	1
boat--Mr.	1
Mounttop's	1
here	1
(by	1
the	1
way,	1
Captain--Mounttop;	1
Mounttop--the	1
captain);--as	1
I	1
was	1
saying,	1
I	1
jumped	1
into	1
Mounttop's	1
boat,	1
which,	1
d'ye	1
see,	1
was	1
gunwale	1
and	1
gunwale	1
with	1
mine,	1
then;	1
and	1
snatching	1
the	1
first	1
harpoon,	1
let	1
this	1
old	1
great-grandfather	1
have	1
it.	1
But,	1
Lord,	1
look	1
you,	1
sir--hearts	1
and	1
souls	1
alive,	1
man--the	1
next	1
instant,	1
in	1
a	1
jiff,	1
I	1
was	1
blind	1
as	1
a	1
bat--both	1
eyes	1
out--all	1
befogged	1
and	1
bedeadened	1
with	1
black	1
foam--the	1
whale's	1
tail	1
looming	1
straight	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
it,	1
perpendicular	1
in	1
the	1
air,	1
like	1
a	1
marble	1
steeple.	1
No	1
use	1
sterning	1
all,	1
then;	1
but	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
groping	1
at	1
midday,	1
with	1
a	1
blinding	1
sun,	1
all	1
crown-jewels;	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
groping,	1
I	1
say,	1
after	1
the	1
second	1
iron,	1
to	1
toss	1
it	1
overboard--down	1
comes	1
the	1
tail	1
like	1
a	1
Lima	1
tower,	1
cutting	1
my	1
boat	1
in	1
two,	1
leaving	1
each	1
half	1
in	1
splinters;	1
and,	1
flukes	1
first,	1
the	1
white	1
hump	1
backed	1
through	1
the	1
wreck,	1
as	1
though	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
chips.	1
We	1
all	1
struck	1
out.	1
To	1
escape	1
his	1
terrible	1
flailings,	1
I	1
seized	1
hold	1
of	1
my	1
harpoon-pole	1
sticking	1
in	1
him,	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
clung	1
to	1
that	1
like	1
a	1
sucking	1
fish.	1
But	1
a	1
combing	1
sea	1
dashed	1
me	1
off,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
instant,	1
the	1
fish,	1
taking	1
one	1
good	1
dart	1
forwards,	1
went	1
down	1
like	1
a	1
flash;	1
and	1
the	1
barb	1
of	1
that	1
cursed	1
second	1
iron	1
towing	1
along	1
near	1
me	1
caught	1
me	1
here"	1
(clapping	1
his	1
hand	1
just	1
below	1
his	1
shoulder);	1
"yes,	1
caught	1
me	1
just	1
here,	1
I	1
say,	1
and	1
bore	1
me	1
down	1
to	1
Hell's	1
flames,	1
I	1
was	1
thinking;	1
when,	1
when,	1
all	1
of	1
a	1
sudden,	1
thank	1
the	1
good	1
God,	1
the	1
barb	1
ript	1
its	1
way	1
along	1
the	1
flesh--clear	1
along	1
the	1
whole	1
length	1
of	1
my	1
arm--came	1
out	1
nigh	1
my	1
wrist,	1
and	1
up	1
I	1
floated;--and	1
that	1
gentleman	1
there	1
will	1
tell	1
you	1
the	1
rest	1
(by	1
the	1
way,	1
captain--Dr.	1
Bunger,	1
ship's	1
surgeon:	1
Bunger,	1
my	1
lad,--the	1
captain).	1
Now,	1
Bunger	1
boy,	1
spin	1
your	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
yarn."	1
The	1
professional	1
gentleman	1
thus	1
familiarly	1
pointed	1
out,	1
had	1
been	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
standing	1
near	1
them,	1
with	1
nothing	1
specific	1
visible,	1
to	1
denote	1
his	1
gentlemanly	1
rank	1
on	1
board.	1
His	1
face	1
was	1
an	1
exceedingly	1
round	1
but	1
sober	1
one;	1
he	1
was	1
dressed	1
in	1
a	1
faded	1
blue	1
woollen	1
frock	1
or	1
shirt,	1
and	1
patched	1
trowsers;	1
and	1
had	1
thus	1
far	1
been	1
dividing	1
his	1
attention	1
between	1
a	1
marlingspike	1
he	1
held	1
in	1
one	1
hand,	1
and	1
a	1
pill-box	1
held	1
in	1
the	1
other,	1
occasionally	1
casting	1
a	1
critical	1
glance	1
at	1
the	1
ivory	1
limbs	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
crippled	1
captains.	1
But,	1
at	1
his	1
superior's	1
introduction	1
of	1
him	1
to	1
Ahab,	1
he	1
politely	1
bowed,	1
and	1
straightway	1
went	1
on	1
to	1
do	1
his	1
captain's	1
bidding.	1
"It	1
was	1
a	1
shocking	1
bad	1
wound,"	1
began	1
the	1
whale-surgeon;	1
"and,	1
taking	1
my	1
advice,	1
Captain	1
Boomer	1
here,	1
stood	1
our	1
old	1
Sammy--"	1
"Samuel	1
Enderby	1
is	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
my	1
ship,"	1
interrupted	1
the	1
one-armed	1
captain,	1
addressing	1
Ahab;	1
"go	1
on,	1
boy."	1
"Stood	1
our	1
old	1
Sammy	1
off	1
to	1
the	1
northward,	1
to	1
get	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
blazing	1
hot	1
weather	1
there	1
on	1
the	1
Line.	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
no	1
use--I	1
did	1
all	1
I	1
could;	1
sat	1
up	1
with	1
him	1
nights;	1
was	1
very	1
severe	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
matter	1
of	1
diet--"	1
"Oh,	1
very	1
severe!"	1
chimed	1
in	1
the	1
patient	1
himself;	1
then	1
suddenly	1
altering	1
his	1
voice,	1
"Drinking	1
hot	1
rum	1
toddies	1
with	1
me	1
every	1
night,	1
till	1
he	1
couldn't	1
see	1
to	1
put	1
on	1
the	1
bandages;	1
and	1
sending	1
me	1
to	1
bed,	1
half	1
seas	1
over,	1
about	1
three	1
o'clock	1
in	1
the	1
morning.	1
Oh,	1
ye	1
stars!	1
he	1
sat	1
up	1
with	1
me	1
indeed,	1
and	1
was	1
very	1
severe	1
in	1
my	1
diet.	1
Oh!	1
a	1
great	1
watcher,	1
and	1
very	1
dietetically	1
severe,	1
is	1
Dr.	1
Bunger.	1
(Bunger,	1
you	1
dog,	1
laugh	1
out!	1
why	1
don't	1
ye?	1
You	1
know	1
you're	1
a	1
precious	1
jolly	1
rascal.)	1
But,	1
heave	1
ahead,	1
boy,	1
I'd	1
rather	1
be	1
killed	1
by	1
you	1
than	1
kept	1
alive	1
by	1
any	1
other	1
man."	1
"My	1
captain,	1
you	1
must	1
have	1
ere	1
this	1
perceived,	1
respected	1
sir"--said	1
the	1
imperturbable	1
godly-looking	1
Bunger,	1
slightly	1
bowing	1
to	1
Ahab--"is	1
apt	1
to	1
be	1
facetious	1
at	1
times;	1
he	1
spins	1
us	1
many	1
clever	1
things	1
of	1
that	1
sort.	1
But	1
I	1
may	1
as	1
well	1
say--en	1
passant,	1
as	1
the	1
French	1
remark--that	1
I	1
myself--that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
Jack	1
Bunger,	1
late	1
of	1
the	1
reverend	1
clergy--am	1
a	1
strict	1
total	1
abstinence	1
man;	1
I	1
never	1
drink--"	1
"Water!"	1
cried	1
the	1
captain;	1
"he	1
never	1
drinks	1
it;	1
it's	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
fits	1
to	1
him;	1
fresh	1
water	1
throws	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
hydrophobia;	1
but	1
go	1
on--go	1
on	1
with	1
the	1
arm	1
story."	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
may	1
as	1
well,"	1
said	1
the	1
surgeon,	1
coolly.	1
"I	1
was	1
about	1
observing,	1
sir,	1
before	1
Captain	1
Boomer's	1
facetious	1
interruption,	1
that	1
spite	1
of	1
my	1
best	1
and	1
severest	1
endeavors,	1
the	1
wound	1
kept	1
getting	1
worse	1
and	1
worse;	1
the	1
truth	1
was,	1
sir,	1
it	1
was	1
as	1
ugly	1
gaping	1
wound	1
as	1
surgeon	1
ever	1
saw;	1
more	1
than	1
two	1
feet	1
and	1
several	1
inches	1
long.	1
I	1
measured	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
lead	1
line.	1
In	1
short,	1
it	1
grew	1
black;	1
I	1
knew	1
what	1
was	1
threatened,	1
and	1
off	1
it	1
came.	1
But	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
hand	1
in	1
shipping	1
that	1
ivory	1
arm	1
there;	1
that	1
thing	1
is	1
against	1
all	1
rule"--pointing	1
at	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
marlingspike--"that	1
is	1
the	1
captain's	1
work,	1
not	1
mine;	1
he	1
ordered	1
the	1
carpenter	1
to	1
make	1
it;	1
he	1
had	1
that	1
club-hammer	1
there	1
put	1
to	1
the	1
end,	1
to	1
knock	1
some	1
one's	1
brains	1
out	1
with,	1
I	1
suppose,	1
as	1
he	1
tried	1
mine	1
once.	1
He	1
flies	1
into	1
diabolical	1
passions	1
sometimes.	1
Do	1
ye	1
see	1
this	1
dent,	1
sir"--removing	1
his	1
hat,	1
and	1
brushing	1
aside	1
his	1
hair,	1
and	1
exposing	1
a	1
bowl-like	1
cavity	1
in	1
his	1
skull,	1
but	1
which	1
bore	1
not	1
the	1
slightest	1
scarry	1
trace,	1
or	1
any	1
token	1
of	1
ever	1
having	1
been	1
a	1
wound--"Well,	1
the	1
captain	1
there	1
will	1
tell	1
you	1
how	1
that	1
came	1
here;	1
he	1
knows."	1
"No,	1
I	1
don't,"	1
said	1
the	1
captain,	1
"but	1
his	1
mother	1
did;	1
he	1
was	1
born	1
with	1
it.	1
Oh,	1
you	1
solemn	1
rogue,	1
you--you	1
Bunger!	1
was	1
there	1
ever	1
such	1
another	1
Bunger	1
in	1
the	1
watery	1
world?	1
Bunger,	1
when	1
you	1
die,	1
you	1
ought	1
to	1
die	1
in	1
pickle,	1
you	1
dog;	1
you	1
should	1
be	1
preserved	1
to	1
future	1
ages,	1
you	1
rascal."	1
"What	1
became	1
of	1
the	1
White	1
Whale?"	1
now	1
cried	1
Ahab,	1
who	1
thus	1
far	1
had	1
been	1
impatiently	1
listening	1
to	1
this	1
by-play	1
between	1
the	1
two	1
Englishmen.	1
"Oh!"	1
cried	1
the	1
one-armed	1
captain,	1
"oh,	1
yes!	1
Well;	1
after	1
he	1
sounded,	1
we	1
didn't	1
see	1
him	1
again	1
for	1
some	1
time;	1
in	1
fact,	1
as	1
I	1
before	1
hinted,	1
I	1
didn't	1
then	1
know	1
what	1
whale	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
had	1
served	1
me	1
such	1
a	1
trick,	1
till	1
some	1
time	1
afterwards,	1
when	1
coming	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
Line,	1
we	1
heard	1
about	1
Moby	1
Dick--as	1
some	1
call	1
him--and	1
then	1
I	1
knew	1
it	1
was	1
he."	1
"Did'st	1
thou	1
cross	1
his	1
wake	1
again?"	1
"Twice."	1
"But	1
could	1
not	1
fasten?"	1
"Didn't	1
want	1
to	1
try	1
to:	1
ain't	1
one	1
limb	1
enough?	1
What	1
should	1
I	1
do	1
without	1
this	1
other	1
arm?	1
And	1
I'm	1
thinking	1
Moby	1
Dick	1
doesn't	1
bite	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
he	1
swallows."	1
"Well,	1
then,"	1
interrupted	1
Bunger,	1
"give	1
him	1
your	1
left	1
arm	1
for	1
bait	1
to	1
get	1
the	1
right.	1
Do	1
you	1
know,	1
gentlemen"--very	1
gravely	1
and	1
mathematically	1
bowing	1
to	1
each	1
Captain	1
in	1
succession--"Do	1
you	1
know,	1
gentlemen,	1
that	1
the	1
digestive	1
organs	1
of	1
the	1
whale	1
are	1
so	1
inscrutably	1
constructed	1
by	1
Divine	1
Providence,	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
quite	1
impossible	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
completely	1
digest	1
even	1
a	1
man's	1
arm?	1
And	1
he	1
knows	1
it	1
too.	1
So	1
that	1
what	1
you	1
take	1
for	1
the	1
White	1
Whale's	1
malice	1
is	1
only	1
his	1
awkwardness.	1
For	1
he	1
never	1
means	1
to	1
swallow	1
a	1
single	1
limb;	1
he	1
only	1
thinks	1
to	1
terrify	1
by	1
feints.	1
But	1
sometimes	1
he	1
is	1
like	1
the	1
old	1
juggling	1
fellow,	1
formerly	1
a	1
patient	1
of	1
mine	1
in	1
Ceylon,	1
that	1
making	1
believe	1
swallow	1
jack-knives,	1
once	1
upon	1
a	1
time	1
let	1
one	1
drop	1
into	1
him	1
in	1
good	1
earnest,	1
and	1
there	1
it	1
stayed	1
for	1
a	1
twelvemonth	1
or	1
more;	1
when	1
I	1
gave	1
him	1
an	1
emetic,	1
and	1
he	1
heaved	1
it	1
up	1
in	1
small	1
tacks,	1
d'ye	1
see.	1
No	1
possible	1
way	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
digest	1
that	1
jack-knife,	1
and	1
fully	1
incorporate	1
it	1
into	1
his	1
general	1
bodily	1
system.	1
Yes,	1
Captain	1
Boomer,	1
if	1
you	1
are	1
quick	1
enough	1
about	1
it,	1
and	1
have	1
a	1
mind	1
to	1
pawn	1
one	1
arm	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
the	1
privilege	1
of	1
giving	1
decent	1
burial	1
to	1
the	1
other,	1
why	1
in	1
that	1
case	1
the	1
arm	1
is	1
yours;	1
only	1
let	1
the	1
whale	1
have	1
another	1
chance	1
at	1
you	1
shortly,	1
that's	1
all."	1
"No,	1
thank	1
ye,	1
Bunger,"	1
said	1
the	1
English	1
Captain,	1
"he's	1
welcome	1
to	1
the	1
arm	1
he	1
has,	1
since	1
I	1
can't	1
help	1
it,	1
and	1
didn't	1
know	1
him	1
then;	1
but	1
not	1
to	1
another	1
one.	1
No	1
more	1
White	1
Whales	1
for	1
me;	1
I've	1
lowered	1
for	1
him	1
once,	1
and	1
that	1
has	1
satisfied	1
me.	1
There	1
would	1
be	1
great	1
glory	1
in	1
killing	1
him,	1
I	1
know	1
that;	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
ship-load	1
of	1
precious	1
sperm	1
in	1
him,	1
but,	1
hark	1
ye,	1
he's	1
best	1
let	1
alone;	1
don't	1
you	1
think	1
so,	1
Captain?"--glancing	1
at	1
the	1
ivory	1
leg.	1
"He	1
is.	1
But	1
he	1
will	1
still	1
be	1
hunted,	1
for	1
all	1
that.	1
What	1
is	1
best	1
let	1
alone,	1
that	1
accursed	1
thing	1
is	1
not	1
always	1
what	1
least	1
allures.	1
He's	1
all	1
a	1
magnet!	1
How	1
long	1
since	1
thou	1
saw'st	1
him	1
last?	1
Which	1
way	1
heading?"	1
"Bless	1
my	1
soul,	1
and	1
curse	1
the	1
foul	1
fiend's,"	1
cried	1
Bunger,	1
stoopingly	1
walking	1
round	1
Ahab,	1
and	1
like	1
a	1
dog,	1
strangely	1
snuffing;	1
"this	1
man's	1
blood--bring	1
the	1
thermometer!--it's	1
at	1
the	1
boiling	1
point!--his	1
pulse	1
makes	1
these	1
planks	1
beat!--sir!"--taking	1
a	1
lancet	1
from	1
his	1
pocket,	1
and	1
drawing	1
near	1
to	1
Ahab's	1
arm.	1
"Avast!"	1
roared	1
Ahab,	1
dashing	1
him	1
against	1
the	1
bulwarks--"Man	1
the	1
boat!	1
Which	1
way	1
heading?"	1
"Good	1
God!"	1
cried	1
the	1
English	1
Captain,	1
to	1
whom	1
the	1
question	1
was	1
put.	1
"What's	1
the	1
matter?	1
He	1
was	1
heading	1
east,	1
I	1
think.--Is	1
your	1
Captain	1
crazy?"	1
whispering	1
Fedallah.	1
But	1
Fedallah,	1
putting	1
a	1
finger	1
on	1
his	1
lip,	1
slid	1
over	1
the	1
bulwarks	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
boat's	1
steering	1
oar,	1
and	1
Ahab,	1
swinging	1
the	1
cutting-tackle	1
towards	1
him,	1
commanded	1
the	1
ship's	1
sailors	1
to	1
stand	1
by	1
to	1
lower.	1
In	1
a	1
moment	1
he	1
was	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
boat's	1
stern,	1
and	1
the	1
Manilla	1
men	1
were	1
springing	1
to	1
their	1
oars.	1
In	1
vain	1
the	1
English	1
Captain	1
hailed	1
him.	1
With	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
stranger	1
ship,	1
and	1
face	1
set	1
like	1
a	1
flint	1
to	1
his	1
own,	1
Ahab	1
stood	1
upright	1
till	1
alongside	1
of	1
the	1
Pequod.	1
CHAPTER	1
101	1
The	1
Decanter.	1
Ere	1
the	1
English	1
ship	1
fades	1
from	1
sight,	1
be	1
it	1
set	1
down	1
here,	1
that	1
she	1
hailed	1
from	1
London,	1
and	1
was	1
named	1
after	1
the	1
late	1
Samuel	1
Enderby,	1
merchant	1
of	1
that	1
city,	1
the	1
original	1
of	1
the	1
famous	1
whaling	1
house	1
of	1
Enderby	1
&	1
Sons;	1
a	1
house	1
which	1
in	1
my	1
poor	1
whaleman's	1
opinion,	1
comes	1
not	1
far	1
behind	1
the	1
united	1
royal	1
houses	1
of	1
the	1
Tudors	1
and	1
Bourbons,	1
in	1
point	1
of	1
real	1
historical	1
interest.	1
How	1
long,	1
prior	1
to	1
the	1
year	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
1775,	1
this	1
great	1
whaling	1
house	1
was	1
in	1
existence,	1
my	1
numerous	1
fish-documents	1
do	1
not	1
make	1
plain;	1
but	1
in	1
that	1
year	1
(1775)	1
it	1
fitted	1
out	1
the	1
first	1
English	1
ships	1
that	1
ever	1
regularly	1
hunted	1
the	1
Sperm	1
Whale;	1
though	1
for	1
some	1
score	1
of	1
years	1
previous	1
(ever	1
since	1
1726)	1
our	1
valiant	1
Coffins	1
and	1
Maceys	1
of	1
Nantucket	1
and	1
the	1
Vineyard	1
had	1
in	1
large	1
fleets	1
pursued	1
that	1
Leviathan,	1
but	1
only	1
in	1
the	1
North	1
and	1
South	1
Atlantic:	1
not	1
elsewhere.	1
Be	1
it	1
distinctly	1
recorded	1
here,	1
that	1
the	1
Nantucketers	1
were	1
the	1
first	1
among	1
mankind	1
to	1
harpoon	1
with	1
civilized	1
steel	1
the	1
great	1
Sperm	1
Whale;	1
and	1
that	1
for	1
half	1
a	1
century	1
they	1
were	1
the	1
only	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
globe	1
who	1
so	1
harpooned	1
him.	1
In	1
1778,	1
a	1
fine	1
ship,	1
the	1
Amelia,	1
fitted	1
out	1
for	1
the	1
express	1
purpose,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
sole	1
charge	1
of	1
the	1
vigorous	1
Enderbys,	1
boldly	1
rounded	1
Cape	1
Horn,	1
and	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
among	1
the	1
nations	1
to	1
lower	1
a	1
whale-boat	1
of	1
any	1
sort	1
in	1
the	1
great	1
South	1
Sea.	1
The	1
voyage	1
was	1
a	1
skilful	1
and	1
lucky	1
one;	1
and	1
returning	1
to	1
her	1
berth	1
with	1
her	1
hold	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
precious	1
sperm,	1
the	1
Amelia's	1
example	1
was	1
soon	1
followed	1
by	1
other	1
ships,	1
English	1
and	1
American,	1
and	1
thus	1
the	1
vast	1
Sperm	1
Whale	1
grounds	1
of	1
the	1
Pacific	1
were	1
thrown	1
open.	1
But	1
not	1
content	1
with	1
this	1
good	1
deed,	1
the	1
indefatigable	1
house	1
again	1
bestirred	1
itself:	1
Samuel	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
Sons--how	1
many,	1
their	1
mother	1
only	1
knows--and	1
under	1
their	1
immediate	1
auspices,	1
and	1
partly,	1
I	1
think,	1
at	1
their	1
expense,	1
the	1
British	1
government	1
was	1
induced	1
to	1
send	1
the	1
sloop-of-war	1
Rattler	1
on	1
a	1
whaling	1
voyage	1
of	1
discovery	1
into	1
the	1
South	1
Sea.	1
Commanded	1
by	1
a	1
naval	1
Post-Captain,	1
the	1
Rattler	1
made	1
a	1
rattling	1
voyage	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
did	1
some	1
service;	1
how	1
much	1
does	1
not	1
appear.	1
But	1
this	1
is	1
not	1
all.	1
In	1
1819,	1
the	1
same	1
house	1
fitted	1
out	1
a	1
discovery	1
whale	1
ship	1
of	1
their	1
own,	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
a	1
tasting	1
cruise	1
to	1
the	1
remote	1
waters	1
of	1
Japan.	1
That	1
ship--well	1
called	1
the	1
"Syren"--made	1
a	1
noble	1
experimental	1
cruise;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
thus	1
that	1
the	1
great	1
Japanese	1
Whaling	1
Ground	1
first	1
became	1
generally	1
known.	1
The	1
Syren	1
in	1
this	1
famous	1
voyage	1
was	1
commanded	1
by	1
a	1
Captain	1
Coffin,	1
a	1
Nantucketer.	1
All	1
honour	1
to	1
the	1
Enderbies,	1
therefore,	1
whose	1
house,	1
I	1
think,	1
exists	1
to	1
the	1
present	1
day;	1
though	1
doubtless	1
the	1
original	1
Samuel	1
must	1
long	1
ago	1
have	1
slipped	1
his	1
cable	1
for	1
the	1
great	1
South	1
Sea	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
world.	1
The	1
ship	1
named	1
after	1
him	1
was	1
worthy	1
of	1
the	1
honour,	1
being	1
a	1
very	1
fast	1
sailer	1
and	1
a	1
noble	1
craft	1
every	1
way.	1
I	1
boarded	1
her	1
once	1
at	1
midnight	1
somewhere	1
off	1
the	1
Patagonian	1
coast,	1
and	1
drank	1
good	1
flip	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
forecastle.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
fine	1
gam	1
we	1
had,	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
trumps--every	1
soul	1
on	1
board.	1
A	1
short	1
life	1
to	1
them,	1
and	1
a	1
jolly	1
death.	1
And	1
that	1
fine	1
gam	1
I	1
had--long,	1
very	1
long	1
after	1
old	1
Ahab	1
touched	1
her	1
planks	1
with	1
his	1
ivory	1
heel--it	1
minds	1
me	1
of	1
the	1
noble,	1
solid,	1
Saxon	1
hospitality	1
of	1
that	1
ship;	1
and	1
may	1
my	1
parson	1
forget	1
me,	1
and	1
the	1
devil	1
remember	1
me,	1
if	1
I	1
ever	1
lose	1
sight	1
of	1
it.	1
Flip?	1
Did	1
I	1
say	1
we	1
had	1
flip?	1
Yes,	1
and	1
we	1
flipped	1
it	1
at	1
the	1
rate	1
of	1
ten	1
gallons	1
the	1
hour;	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
squall	1
came	1
(for	1
it's	1
squally	1
off	1
there	1
by	1
Patagonia),	1
and	1
all	1
hands--visitors	1
and	1
all--were	1
called	1
to	1
reef	1
topsails,	1
we	1
were	1
so	1
top-heavy	1
that	1
we	1
had	1
to	1
swing	1
each	1
other	1
aloft	1
in	1
bowlines;	1
and	1
we	1
ignorantly	1
furled	1
the	1
skirts	1
of	1
our	1
jackets	1
into	1
the	1
sails,	1
so	1
that	1
we	1
hung	1
there,	1
reefed	1
fast	1
in	1
the	1
howling	1
gale,	1
a	1
warning	1
example	1
to	1
all	1
drunken	1
tars.	1
However,	1
the	1
masts	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
overboard;	1
and	1
by	1
and	1
by	1
we	1
scrambled	1
down,	1
so	1
sober,	1
that	1
we	1
had	1
to	1
pass	1
the	1
flip	1
again,	1
though	1
the	1
savage	1
salt	1
spray	1
bursting	1
down	1
the	1
forecastle	1
scuttle,	1
rather	1
too	1
much	1
diluted	1
and	1
pickled	1
it	1
to	1
my	1
taste.	1
The	1
beef	1
was	1
fine--tough,	1
but	1
with	1
body	1
in	1
it.	1
They	1
said	1
it	1
was	1
bull-beef;	1
others,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
dromedary	1
beef;	1
but	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know,	1
for	1
certain,	1
how	1
that	1
was.	1
They	1
had	1
dumplings	1
too;	1
small,	1
but	1
substantial,	1
symmetrically	1
globular,	1
and	1
indestructible	1
dumplings.	1
I	1
fancied	1
that	1
you	1
could	1
feel	1
them,	1
and	1
roll	1
them	1
about	1
in	1
you	1
after	1
they	1
were	1
swallowed.	1
If	1
you	1
stooped	1
over	1
too	1
far	1
forward,	1
you	1
risked	1
their	1
pitching	1
out	1
of	1
you	1
like	1
billiard-balls.	1
The	1
bread--but	1
that	1
couldn't	1
be	1
helped;	1
besides,	1
it	1
was	1
an	1
anti-scorbutic;	1
in	1
short,	1
the	1
bread	1
contained	1
the	1
only	1
fresh	1
fare	1
they	1
had.	1
But	1
the	1
forecastle	1
was	1
not	1
very	1
light,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
very	1
easy	1
to	1
step	1
over	1
into	1
a	1
dark	1
corner	1
when	1
you	1
ate	1
it.	1
But	1
all	1
in	1
all,	1
taking	1
her	1
from	1
truck	1
to	1
helm,	1
considering	1
the	1
dimensions	1
of	1
the	1
cook's	1
boilers,	1
including	1
his	1
own	1
live	1
parchment	1
boilers;	1
fore	1
and	1
aft,	1
I	1
say,	1
the	1
Samuel	1
Enderby	1
was	1
a	1
jolly	1
ship;	1
of	1
good	1
fare	1
and	1
plenty;	1
fine	1
flip	1
and	1
strong;	1
crack	1
fellows	1
all,	1
and	1
capital	1
from	1
boot	1
heels	1
to	1
hat-band.	1
But	1
why	1
was	1
it,	1
think	1
ye,	1
that	1
the	1
Samuel	1
Enderby,	1
and	1
some	1
other	1
English	1
whalers	1
I	1
know	1
of--not	1
all	1
though--were	1
such	1
famous,	1
hospitable	1
ships;	1
that	1
passed	1
round	1
the	1
beef,	1
and	1
the	1
bread,	1
and	1
the	1
can,	1
and	1
the	1
joke;	1
and	1
were	1
not	1
soon	1
weary	1
of	1
eating,	1
and	1
drinking,	1
and	1
laughing?	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
you.	1
The	1
abounding	1
good	1
cheer	1
of	1
these	1
English	1
whalers	1
is	1
matter	1
for	1
historical	1
research.	1
Nor	1
have	1
I	1
been	1
at	1
all	1
sparing	1
of	1
historical	1
whale	1
research,	1
when	1
it	1
has	1
seemed	1
needed.	1
The	1
English	1
were	1
preceded	1
in	1
the	1
whale	1
fishery	1
by	1
the	1
Hollanders,	1
Zealanders,	1
and	1
Danes;	1
from	1
whom	1
they	1
derived	1
many	1
terms	1
still	1
extant	1
in	1
the	1
fishery;	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
yet	1
more,	1
their	1
fat	1
old	1
fashions,	1
touching	1
plenty	1
to	1
eat	1
and	1
drink.	1
For,	1
as	1
a	1
general	1
thing,	1
the	1
English	1
merchant-ship	1
scrimps	1
her	1
crew;	1
but	1
not	1
so	1
the	1
English	1
whaler.	1
Hence,	1
in	1
the	1
English,	1
this	1
thing	1
of	1
whaling	1
good	1
cheer	1
is	1
not	1
normal	1
and	1
natural,	1
but	1
incidental	1
and	1
particular;	1
and,	1
therefore,	1
must	1
have	1
some	1
special	1
origin,	1
which	1
is	1
here	1
pointed	1
out,	1
and	1
will	1
be	1
still	1
further	1
elucidated.	1
During	1
my	1
researches	1
in	1
the	1
Leviathanic	1
histories,	1
I	1
stumbled	1
upon	1
an	1
ancient	1
Dutch	1
volume,	1
which,	1
by	1
the	1
musty	1
whaling	1
smell	1
of	1
it,	1
I	1
knew	1
must	1
be	1
about	1
whalers.	1
The	1
title	1
was,	1
"Dan	1
Coopman,"	1
wherefore	1
I	1
concluded	1
that	1
this	1
must	1
be	1
the	1
invaluable	1
memoirs	1
of	1
some	1
Amsterdam	1
cooper	1
in	1
the	1
fishery,	1
as	1
every	1
whale	1
ship	1
must	1
carry	1
its	1
cooper.	1
I	1
was	1
reinforced	1
in	1
this	1
opinion	1
by	1
seeing	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
production	1
of	1
one	1
"Fitz	1
Swackhammer."	1
But	1
my	1
friend	1
Dr.	1
Snodhead,	1
a	1
very	1
learned	1
man,	1
professor	1
of	1
Low	1
Dutch	1
and	1
High	1
German	1
in	1
the	1
college	1
of	1
Santa	1
Claus	1
and	1
St.	1
Pott's,	1
to	1
whom	1
I	1
handed	1
the	1
work	1
for	1
translation,	1
giving	1
him	1
a	1
box	1
of	1
sperm	1
candles	1
for	1
his	1
trouble--this	1
same	1
Dr.	1
Snodhead,	1
so	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
spied	1
the	1
book,	1
assured	1
me	1
that	1
"Dan	1
Coopman"	1
did	1
not	1
mean	1
"The	1
Cooper,"	1
but	1
"The	1
Merchant."	1
In	1
short,	1
this	1
ancient	1
and	1
learned	1
Low	1
Dutch	1
book	1
treated	1
of	1
the	1
commerce	1
of	1
Holland;	1
and,	1
among	1
other	1
subjects,	1
contained	1
a	1
very	1
interesting	1
account	1
of	1
its	1
whale	1
fishery.	1
And	1
in	1
this	1
chapter	1
it	1
was,	1
headed,	1
"Smeer,"	1
or	1
"Fat,"	1
that	1
I	1
found	1
a	1
long	1
detailed	1
list	1
of	1
the	1
outfits	1
for	1
the	1
larders	1
and	1
cellars	1
of	1
180	1
sail	1
of	1
Dutch	1
whalemen;	1
from	1
which	1
list,	1
as	1
translated	1
by	1
Dr.	1
Snodhead,	1
I	1
transcribe	1
the	1
following:	1
400,000	1
lbs.	1
of	1
beef.	1
60,000	1
lbs.	1
Friesland	1
pork.	1
150,000	1
lbs.	1
of	1
stock	1
fish.	1
550,000	1
lbs.	1
of	1
biscuit.	1
72,000	1
lbs.	1
of	1
soft	1
bread.	1
2,800	1
firkins	1
of	1
butter.	1
20,000	1
lbs.	1
Texel	1
&	1
Leyden	1
cheese.	1
144,000	1
lbs.	1
cheese	1
(probably	1
an	1
inferior	1
article).	1
550	1
ankers	1
of	1
Geneva.	1
10,800	1
barrels	1
of	1
beer.	1
Most	1
statistical	1
tables	1
are	1
parchingly	1
dry	1
in	1
the	1
reading;	1
not	1
so	1
in	1
the	1
present	1
case,	1
however,	1
where	1
the	1
reader	1
is	1
flooded	1
with	1
whole	1
pipes,	1
barrels,	1
quarts,	1
and	1
gills	1
of	1
good	1
gin	1
and	1
good	1
cheer.	1
At	1
the	1
time,	1
I	1
devoted	1
three	1
days	1
to	1
the	1
studious	1
digesting	1
of	1
all	1
this	1
beer,	1
beef,	1
and	1
bread,	1
during	1
which	1
many	1
profound	1
thoughts	1
were	1
incidentally	1
suggested	1
to	1
me,	1
capable	1
of	1
a	1
transcendental	1
and	1
Platonic	1
application;	1
and,	1
furthermore,	1
I	1
compiled	1
supplementary	1
tables	1
of	1
my	1
own,	1
touching	1
the	1
probable	1
quantity	1
of	1
stock-fish,	1
etc.,	1
consumed	1
by	1
every	1
Low	1
Dutch	1
harpooneer	1
in	1
that	1
ancient	1
Greenland	1
and	1
Spitzbergen	1
whale	1
fishery.	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
place,	1
the	1
amount	1
of	1
butter,	1
and	1
Texel	1
and	1
Leyden	1
cheese	1
consumed,	1
seems	1
amazing.	1
I	1
impute	1
it,	1
though,	1
to	1
their	1
naturally	1
unctuous	1
natures,	1
being	1
rendered	1
still	1
more	1
unctuous	1
by	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
their	1
vocation,	1
and	1
especially	1
by	1
their	1
pursuing	1
their	1
game	1
in	1
those	1
frigid	1
Polar	1
Seas,	1
on	1
the	1
very	1
coasts	1
of	1
that	1
Esquimaux	1
country	1
where	1
the	1
convivial	1
natives	1
pledge	1
each	1
other	1
in	1
bumpers	1
of	1
train	1
oil.	1
The	1
quantity	1
of	1
beer,	1
too,	1
is	1
very	1
large,	1
10,800	1
barrels.	1
Now,	1
as	1
those	1
polar	1
fisheries	1
could	1
only	1
be	1
prosecuted	1
in	1
the	1
short	1
summer	1
of	1
that	1
climate,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
whole	1
cruise	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
Dutch	1
whalemen,	1
including	1
the	1
short	1
voyage	1
to	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
Spitzbergen	1
sea,	1
did	1
not	1
much	1
exceed	1
three	1
months,	1
say,	1
and	1
reckoning	1
30	1
men	1
to	1
each	1
of	1
their	1
fleet	1
of	1
180	1
sail,	1
we	1
have	1
5,400	1
Low	1
Dutch	1
seamen	1
in	1
all;	1
therefore,	1
I	1
say,	1
we	1
have	1
precisely	1
two	1
barrels	1
of	1
beer	1
per	1
man,	1
for	1
a	1
twelve	1
weeks'	1
allowance,	1
exclusive	1
of	1
his	1
fair	1
proportion	1
of	1
that	1
550	1
ankers	1
of	1
gin.	1
Now,	1
whether	1
these	1
gin	1
and	1
beer	1
harpooneers,	1
so	1
fuddled	1
as	1
one	1
might	1
fancy	1
them	1
to	1
have	1
been,	1
were	1
the	1
right	1
sort	1
of	1
men	1
to	1
stand	1
up	1
in	1
a	1
boat's	1
head,	1
and	1
take	1
good	1
aim	1
at	1
flying	1
whales;	1
this	1
would	1
seem	1
somewhat	1
improbable.	1
Yet	1
they	1
did	1
aim	1
at	1
them,	1
and	1
hit	1
them	1
too.	1
But	1
this	1
was	1
very	1
far	1
North,	1
be	1
it	1
remembered,	1
where	1
beer	1
agrees	1
well	1
with	1
the	1
constitution;	1
upon	1
the	1
Equator,	1
in	1
our	1
southern	1
fishery,	1
beer	1
would	1
be	1
apt	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
harpooneer	1
sleepy	1
at	1
the	1
mast-head	1
and	1
boozy	1
in	1
his	1
boat;	1
and	1
grievous	1
loss	1
might	1
ensue	1
to	1
Nantucket	1
and	1
New	1
Bedford.	1
But	1
no	1
more;	1
enough	1
has	1
been	1
said	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
the	1
old	1
Dutch	1
whalers	1
of	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
centuries	1
ago	1
were	1
high	1
livers;	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
English	1
whalers	1
have	1
not	1
neglected	1
so	1
excellent	1
an	1
example.	1
For,	1
say	1
they,	1
when	1
cruising	1
in	1
an	1
empty	1
ship,	1
if	1
you	1
can	1
get	1
nothing	1
better	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
get	1
a	1
good	1
dinner	1
out	1
of	1
it,	1
at	1
least.	1
And	1
this	1
empties	1
the	1
decanter.	1
CHAPTER	1
102	1
A	1
Bower	1
in	1
the	1
Arsacides.	1
Hitherto,	1
in	1
descriptively	1
treating	1
of	1
the	1
Sperm	1
Whale,	1
I	1
have	1
chiefly	1
dwelt	1
upon	1
the	1
marvels	1
of	1
his	1
outer	1
aspect;	1
or	1
separately	1
and	1
in	1
detail	1
upon	1
some	1
few	1
interior	1
structural	1
features.	1
But	1
to	1
a	1
large	1
and	1
thorough	1
sweeping	1
comprehension	1
of	1
him,	1
it	1
behooves	1
me	1
now	1
to	1
unbutton	1
him	1
still	1
further,	1
and	1
untagging	1
the	1
points	1
of	1
his	1
hose,	1
unbuckling	1
his	1
garters,	1
and	1
casting	1
loose	1
the	1
hooks	1
and	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
joints	1
of	1
his	1
innermost	1
bones,	1
set	1
him	1
before	1
you	1
in	1
his	1
ultimatum;	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
in	1
his	1
unconditional	1
skeleton.	1
But	1
how	1
now,	1
Ishmael?	1
How	1
is	1
it,	1
that	1
you,	1
a	1
mere	1
oarsman	1
in	1
the	1
fishery,	1
pretend	1
to	1
know	1
aught	1
about	1
the	1
subterranean	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
whale?	1
Did	1
erudite	1
Stubb,	1
mounted	1
upon	1
your	1
capstan,	1
deliver	1
lectures	1
on	1
the	1
anatomy	1
of	1
the	1
Cetacea;	1
and	1
by	1
help	1
of	1
the	1
windlass,	1
hold	1
up	1
a	1
specimen	1
rib	1
for	1
exhibition?	1
Explain	1
thyself,	1
Ishmael.	1
Can	1
you	1
land	1
a	1
full-grown	1
whale	1
on	1
your	1
deck	1
for	1
examination,	1
as	1
a	1
cook	1
dishes	1
a	1
roast-pig?	1
Surely	1
not.	1
A	1
veritable	1
witness	1
have	1
you	1
hitherto	1
been,	1
Ishmael;	1
but	1
have	1
a	1
care	1
how	1
you	1
seize	1
the	1
privilege	1
of	1
Jonah	1
alone;	1
the	1
privilege	1
of	1
discoursing	1
upon	1
the	1
joists	1
and	1
beams;	1
the	1
rafters,	1
ridge-pole,	1
sleepers,	1
and	1
under-pinnings,	1
making	1
up	1
the	1
frame-work	1
of	1
leviathan;	1
and	1
belike	1
of	1
the	1
tallow-vats,	1
dairy-rooms,	1
butteries,	1
and	1
cheeseries	1
in	1
his	1
bowels.	1
I	1
confess,	1
that	1
since	1
Jonah,	1
few	1
whalemen	1
have	1
penetrated	1
very	1
far	1
beneath	1
the	1
skin	1
of	1
the	1
adult	1
whale;	1
nevertheless,	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
blessed	1
with	1
an	1
opportunity	1
to	1
dissect	1
him	1
in	1
miniature.	1
In	1
a	1
ship	1
I	1
belonged	1
to,	1
a	1
small	1
cub	1
Sperm	1
Whale	1
was	1
once	1
bodily	1
hoisted	1
to	1
the	1
deck	1
for	1
his	1
poke	1
or	1
bag,	1
to	1
make	1
sheaths	1
for	1
the	1
barbs	1
of	1
the	1
harpoons,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
the	1
lances.	1
Think	1
you	1
I	1
let	1
that	1
chance	1
go,	1
without	1
using	1
my	1
boat-hatchet	1
and	1
jack-knife,	1
and	1
breaking	1
the	1
seal	1
and	1
reading	1
all	1
the	1
contents	1
of	1
that	1
young	1
cub?	1
And	1
as	1
for	1
my	1
exact	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
bones	1
of	1
the	1
leviathan	1
in	1
their	1
gigantic,	1
full	1
grown	1
development,	1
for	1
that	1
rare	1
knowledge	1
I	1
am	1
indebted	1
to	1
my	1
late	1
royal	1
friend	1
Tranquo,	1
king	1
of	1
Tranque,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
Arsacides.	1
For	1
being	1
at	1
Tranque,	1
years	1
ago,	1
when	1
attached	1
to	1
the	1
trading-ship	1
Dey	1
of	1
Algiers,	1
I	1
was	1
invited	1
to	1
spend	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
Arsacidean	1
holidays	1
with	1
the	1
lord	1
of	1
Tranque,	1
at	1
his	1
retired	1
palm	1
villa	1
at	1
Pupella;	1
a	1
sea-side	1
glen	1
not	1
very	1
far	1
distant	1
from	1
what	1
our	1
sailors	1
called	1
Bamboo-Town,	1
his	1
capital.	1
Among	1
many	1
other	1
fine	1
qualities,	1
my	1
royal	1
friend	1
Tranquo,	1
being	1
gifted	1
with	1
a	1
devout	1
love	1
for	1
all	1
matters	1
of	1
barbaric	1
vertu,	1
had	1
brought	1
together	1
in	1
Pupella	1
whatever	1
rare	1
things	1
the	1
more	1
ingenious	1
of	1
his	1
people	1
could	1
invent;	1
chiefly	1
carved	1
woods	1
of	1
wonderful	1
devices,	1
chiselled	1
shells,	1
inlaid	1
spears,	1
costly	1
paddles,	1
aromatic	1
canoes;	1
and	1
all	1
these	1
distributed	1
among	1
whatever	1
natural	1
wonders,	1
the	1
wonder-freighted,	1
tribute-rendering	1
waves	1
had	1
cast	1
upon	1
his	1
shores.	1
Chief	1
among	1
these	1
latter	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
Sperm	1
Whale,	1
which,	1
after	1
an	1
unusually	1
long	1
raging	1
gale,	1
had	1
been	1
found	1
dead	1
and	1
stranded,	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
against	1
a	1
cocoa-nut	1
tree,	1
whose	1
plumage-like,	1
tufted	1
droopings	1
seemed	1
his	1
verdant	1
jet.	1
When	1
the	1
vast	1
body	1
had	1
at	1
last	1
been	1
stripped	1
of	1
its	1
fathom-deep	1
enfoldings,	1
and	1
the	1
bones	1
become	1
dust	1
dry	1
in	1
the	1
sun,	1
then	1
the	1
skeleton	1
was	1
carefully	1
transported	1
up	1
the	1
Pupella	1
glen,	1
where	1
a	1
grand	1
temple	1
of	1
lordly	1
palms	1
now	1
sheltered	1
it.	1
The	1
ribs	1
were	1
hung	1
with	1
trophies;	1
the	1
vertebrae	1
were	1
carved	1
with	1
Arsacidean	1
annals,	1
in	1
strange	1
hieroglyphics;	1
in	1
the	1
skull,	1
the	1
priests	1
kept	1
up	1
an	1
unextinguished	1
aromatic	1
flame,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
mystic	1
head	1
again	1
sent	1
forth	1
its	1
vapoury	1
spout;	1
while,	1
suspended	1
from	1
a	1
bough,	1
the	1
terrific	1
lower	1
jaw	1
vibrated	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
devotees,	1
like	1
the	1
hair-hung	1
sword	1
that	1
so	1
affrighted	1
Damocles.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
wondrous	1
sight.	1
The	1
wood	1
was	1
green	1
as	1
mosses	1
of	1
the	1
Icy	1
Glen;	1
the	1
trees	1
stood	1
high	1
and	1
haughty,	1
feeling	1
their	1
living	1
sap;	1
the	1
industrious	1
earth	1
beneath	1
was	1
as	1
a	1
weaver's	1
loom,	1
with	1
a	1
gorgeous	1
carpet	1
on	1
it,	1
whereof	1
the	1
ground-vine	1
tendrils	1
formed	1
the	1
warp	1
and	1
woof,	1
and	1
the	1
living	1
flowers	1
the	1
figures.	1
All	1
the	1
trees,	1
with	1
all	1
their	1
laden	1
branches;	1
all	1
the	1
shrubs,	1
and	1
ferns,	1
and	1
grasses;	1
the	1
message-carrying	1
air;	1
all	1
these	1
unceasingly	1
were	1
active.	1
Through	1
the	1
lacings	1
of	1
the	1
leaves,	1
the	1
great	1
sun	1
seemed	1
a	1
flying	1
shuttle	1
weaving	1
the	1
unwearied	1
verdure.	1
Oh,	1
busy	1
weaver!	1
unseen	1
weaver!--pause!--one	1
word!--whither	1
flows	1
the	1
fabric?	1
what	1
palace	1
may	1
it	1
deck?	1
wherefore	1
all	1
these	1
ceaseless	1
toilings?	1
Speak,	1
weaver!--stay	1
thy	1
hand!--but	1
one	1
single	1
word	1
with	1
thee!	1
Nay--the	1
shuttle	1
flies--the	1
figures	1
float	1
from	1
forth	1
the	1
loom;	1
the	1
freshet-rushing	1
carpet	1
for	1
ever	1
slides	1
away.	1
The	1
weaver-god,	1
he	1
weaves;	1
and	1
by	1
that	1
weaving	1
is	1
he	1
deafened,	1
that	1
he	1
hears	1
no	1
mortal	1
voice;	1
and	1
by	1
that	1
humming,	1
we,	1
too,	1
who	1
look	1
on	1
the	1
loom	1
are	1
deafened;	1
and	1
only	1
when	1
we	1
escape	1
it	1
shall	1
we	1
hear	1
the	1
thousand	1
voices	1
that	1
speak	1
through	1
it.	1
For	1
even	1
so	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
all	1
material	1
factories.	1
The	1
spoken	1
words	1
that	1
are	1
inaudible	1
among	1
the	1
flying	1
spindles;	1
those	1
same	1
words	1
are	1
plainly	1
heard	1
without	1
the	1
walls,	1
bursting	1
from	1
the	1
opened	1
casements.	1
Thereby	1
have	1
villainies	1
been	1
detected.	1
Ah,	1
mortal!	1
then,	1
be	1
heedful;	1
for	1
so,	1
in	1
all	1
this	1
din	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
world's	1
loom,	1
thy	1
subtlest	1
thinkings	1
may	1
be	1
overheard	1
afar.	1
Now,	1
amid	1
the	1
green,	1
life-restless	1
loom	1
of	1
that	1
Arsacidean	1
wood,	1
the	1
great,	1
white,	1
worshipped	1
skeleton	1
lay	1
lounging--a	1
gigantic	1
idler!	1
Yet,	1
as	1
the	1
ever-woven	1
verdant	1
warp	1
and	1
woof	1
intermixed	1
and	1
hummed	1
around	1
him,	1
the	1
mighty	1
idler	1
seemed	1
the	1
cunning	1
weaver;	1
himself	1
all	1
woven	1
over	1
with	1
the	1
vines;	1
every	1
month	1
assuming	1
greener,	1
fresher	1
verdure;	1
but	1
himself	1
a	1
skeleton.	1
Life	1
folded	1
Death;	1
Death	1
trellised	1
Life;	1
the	1
grim	1
god	1
wived	1
with	1
youthful	1
Life,	1
and	1
begat	1
him	1
curly-headed	1
glories.	1
Now,	1
when	1
with	1
royal	1
Tranquo	1
I	1
visited	1
this	1
wondrous	1
whale,	1
and	1
saw	1
the	1
skull	1
an	1
altar,	1
and	1
the	1
artificial	1
smoke	1
ascending	1
from	1
where	1
the	1
real	1
jet	1
had	1
issued,	1
I	1
marvelled	1
that	1
the	1
king	1
should	1
regard	1
a	1
chapel	1
as	1
an	1
object	1
of	1
vertu.	1
He	1
laughed.	1
But	1
more	1
I	1
marvelled	1
that	1
the	1
priests	1
should	1
swear	1
that	1
smoky	1
jet	1
of	1
his	1
was	1
genuine.	1
To	1
and	1
fro	1
I	1
paced	1
before	1
this	1
skeleton--brushed	1
the	1
vines	1
aside--broke	1
through	1
the	1
ribs--and	1
with	1
a	1
ball	1
of	1
Arsacidean	1
twine,	1
wandered,	1
eddied	1
long	1
amid	1
its	1
many	1
winding,	1
shaded	1
colonnades	1
and	1
arbours.	1
But	1
soon	1
my	1
line	1
was	1
out;	1
and	1
following	1
it	1
back,	1
I	1
emerged	1
from	1
the	1
opening	1
where	1
I	1
entered.	1
I	1
saw	1
no	1
living	1
thing	1
within;	1
naught	1
was	1
there	1
but	1
bones.	1
Cutting	1
me	1
a	1
green	1
measuring-rod,	1
I	1
once	1
more	1
dived	1
within	1
the	1
skeleton.	1
From	1
their	1
arrow-slit	1
in	1
the	1
skull,	1
the	1
priests	1
perceived	1
me	1
taking	1
the	1
altitude	1
of	1
the	1
final	1
rib,	1
"How	1
now!"	1
they	1
shouted;	1
"Dar'st	1
thou	1
measure	1
this	1
our	1
god!	1
That's	1
for	1
us."	1
"Aye,	1
priests--well,	1
how	1
long	1
do	1
ye	1
make	1
him,	1
then?"	1
But	1
hereupon	1
a	1
fierce	1
contest	1
rose	1
among	1
them,	1
concerning	1
feet	1
and	1
inches;	1
they	1
cracked	1
each	1
other's	1
sconces	1
with	1
their	1
yard-sticks--the	1
great	1
skull	1
echoed--and	1
seizing	1
that	1
lucky	1
chance,	1
I	1
quickly	1
concluded	1
my	1
own	1
admeasurements.	1
These	1
admeasurements	1
I	1
now	1
propose	1
to	1
set	1
before	1
you.	1
But	1
first,	1
be	1
it	1
recorded,	1
that,	1
in	1
this	1
matter,	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
free	1
to	1
utter	1
any	1
fancied	1
measurement	1
I	1
please.	1
Because	1
there	1
are	1
skeleton	1
authorities	1
you	1
can	1
refer	1
to,	1
to	1
test	1
my	1
accuracy.	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
Leviathanic	1
Museum,	1
they	1
tell	1
me,	1
in	1
Hull,	1
England,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
whaling	1
ports	1
of	1
that	1
country,	1
where	1
they	1
have	1
some	1
fine	1
specimens	1
of	1
fin-backs	1
and	1
other	1
whales.	1
Likewise,	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
museum	1
of	1
Manchester,	1
in	1
New	1
Hampshire,	1
they	1
have	1
what	1
the	1
proprietors	1
call	1
"the	1
only	1
perfect	1
specimen	1
of	1
a	1
Greenland	1
or	1
River	1
Whale	1
in	1
the	1
United	1
States."	1
Moreover,	1
at	1
a	1
place	1
in	1
Yorkshire,	1
England,	1
Burton	1
Constable	1
by	1
name,	1
a	1
certain	1
Sir	1
Clifford	1
Constable	1
has	1
in	1
his	1
possession	1
the	1
skeleton	1
of	1
a	1
Sperm	1
Whale,	1
but	1
of	1
moderate	1
size,	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
of	1
the	1
full-grown	1
magnitude	1
of	1
my	1
friend	1
King	1
Tranquo's.	1
In	1
both	1
cases,	1
the	1
stranded	1
whales	1
to	1
which	1
these	1
two	1
skeletons	1
belonged,	1
were	1
originally	1
claimed	1
by	1
their	1
proprietors	1
upon	1
similar	1
grounds.	1
King	1
Tranquo	1
seizing	1
his	1
because	1
he	1
wanted	1
it;	1
and	1
Sir	1
Clifford,	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
lord	1
of	1
the	1
seignories	1
of	1
those	1
parts.	1
Sir	1
Clifford's	1
whale	1
has	1
been	1
articulated	1
throughout;	1
so	1
that,	1
like	1
a	1
great	1
chest	1
of	1
drawers,	1
you	1
can	1
open	1
and	1
shut	1
him,	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
bony	1
cavities--spread	1
out	1
his	1
ribs	1
like	1
a	1
gigantic	1
fan--and	1
swing	1
all	1
day	1
upon	1
his	1
lower	1
jaw.	1
Locks	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
put	1
upon	1
some	1
of	1
his	1
trap-doors	1
and	1
shutters;	1
and	1
a	1
footman	1
will	1
show	1
round	1
future	1
visitors	1
with	1
a	1
bunch	1
of	1
keys	1
at	1
his	1
side.	1
Sir	1
Clifford	1
thinks	1
of	1
charging	1
twopence	1
for	1
a	1
peep	1
at	1
the	1
whispering	1
gallery	1
in	1
the	1
spinal	1
column;	1
threepence	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
echo	1
in	1
the	1
hollow	1
of	1
his	1
cerebellum;	1
and	1
sixpence	1
for	1
the	1
unrivalled	1
view	1
from	1
his	1
forehead.	1
The	1
skeleton	1
dimensions	1
I	1
shall	1
now	1
proceed	1
to	1
set	1
down	1
are	1
copied	1
verbatim	1
from	1
my	1
right	1
arm,	1
where	1
I	1
had	1
them	1
tattooed;	1
as	1
in	1
my	1
wild	1
wanderings	1
at	1
that	1
period,	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
other	1
secure	1
way	1
of	1
preserving	1
such	1
valuable	1
statistics.	1
But	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
crowded	1
for	1
space,	1
and	1
wished	1
the	1
other	1
parts	1
of	1
my	1
body	1
to	1
remain	1
a	1
blank	1
page	1
for	1
a	1
poem	1
I	1
was	1
then	1
composing--at	1
least,	1
what	1
untattooed	1
parts	1
might	1
remain--I	1
did	1
not	1
trouble	1
myself	1
with	1
the	1
odd	1
inches;	1
nor,	1
indeed,	1
should	1
inches	1
at	1
all	1
enter	1
into	1
a	1
congenial	1
admeasurement	1
of	1
the	1
whale.	1
CHAPTER	1
103	1
Measurement	1
of	1
The	1
Whale's	1
Skeleton.	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
place,	1
I	1
wish	1
to	1
lay	1
before	1
you	1
a	1
particular,	1
plain	1
statement,	1
touching	1
the	1
living	1
bulk	1
of	1
this	1
leviathan,	1
whose	1
skeleton	1
we	1
are	1
briefly	1
to	1
exhibit.	1
Such	1
a	1
statement	1
may	1
prove	1
useful	1
here.	1
According	1
to	1
a	1
careful	1
calculation	1
I	1
have	1
made,	1
and	1
which	1
I	1
partly	1
base	1
upon	1
Captain	1
Scoresby's	1
estimate,	1
of	1
seventy	1
tons	1
for	1
the	1
largest	1
sized	1
Greenland	1
whale	1
of	1
sixty	1
feet	1
in	1
length;	1
according	1
to	1
my	1
careful	1
calculation,	1
I	1
say,	1
a	1
Sperm	1
Whale	1
of	1
the	1
largest	1
magnitude,	1
between	1
eighty-five	1
and	1
ninety	1
feet	1
in	1
length,	1
and	1
something	1
less	1
than	1
forty	1
feet	1
in	1
its	1
fullest	1
circumference,	1
such	1
a	1
whale	1
will	1
weigh	1
at	1
least	1
ninety	1
tons;	1
so	1
that,	1
reckoning	1
thirteen	1
men	1
to	1
a	1
ton,	1
he	1
would	1
considerably	1
outweigh	1
the	1
combined	1
population	1
of	1
a	1
whole	1
village	1
of	1
one	1
thousand	1
one	1
hundred	1
inhabitants.	1
Think	1
you	1
not	1
then	1
that	1
brains,	1
like	1
yoked	1
cattle,	1
should	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
this	1
leviathan,	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
at	1
all	1
budge	1
to	1
any	1
landsman's	1
imagination?	1
Having	1
already	1
in	1
various	1
ways	1
put	1
before	1
you	1
his	1
skull,	1
spout-hole,	1
jaw,	1
teeth,	1
tail,	1
forehead,	1
fins,	1
and	1
divers	1
other	1
parts,	1
I	1
shall	1
now	1
simply	1
point	1
out	1
what	1
is	1
most	1
interesting	1
in	1
the	1
general	1
bulk	1
of	1
his	1
unobstructed	1
bones.	1
But	1
as	1
the	1
colossal	1
skull	1
embraces	1
so	1
very	1
large	1
a	1
proportion	1
of	1
the	1
entire	1
extent	1
of	1
the	1
skeleton;	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
by	1
far	1
the	1
most	1
complicated	1
part;	1
and	1
as	1
nothing	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
repeated	1
concerning	1
it	1
in	1
this	1
chapter,	1
you	1
must	1
not	1
fail	1
to	1
carry	1
it	1
in	1
your	1
mind,	1
or	1
under	1
your	1
arm,	1
as	1
we	1
proceed,	1
otherwise	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
gain	1
a	1
complete	1
notion	1
of	1
the	1
general	1
structure	1
we	1
are	1
about	1
to	1
view.	1
In	1
length,	1
the	1
Sperm	1
Whale's	1
skeleton	1
at	1
Tranque	1
measured	1
seventy-two	1
Feet;	1
so	1
that	1
when	1
fully	1
invested	1
and	1
extended	1
in	1
life,	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
ninety	1
feet	1
long;	1
for	1
in	1
the	1
whale,	1
the	1
skeleton	1
loses	1
about	1
one	1
fifth	1
in	1
length	1
compared	1
with	1
the	1
living	1
body.	1
Of	1
this	1
seventy-two	1
feet,	1
his	1
skull	1
and	1
jaw	1
comprised	1
some	1
twenty	1
feet,	1
leaving	1
some	1
fifty	1
feet	1
of	1
plain	1
back-bone.	1
Attached	1
to	1
this	1
back-bone,	1
for	1
something	1
less	1
than	1
a	1
third	1
of	1
its	1
length,	1
was	1
the	1
mighty	1
circular	1
basket	1
of	1
ribs	1
which	1
once	1
enclosed	1
his	1
vitals.	1
To	1
me	1
this	1
vast	1
ivory-ribbed	1
chest,	1
with	1
the	1
long,	1
unrelieved	1
spine,	1
extending	1
far	1
away	1
from	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
straight	1
line,	1
not	1
a	1
little	1
resembled	1
the	1
hull	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
ship	1
new-laid	1
upon	1
the	1
stocks,	1
when	1
only	1
some	1
twenty	1
of	1
her	1
naked	1
bow-ribs	1
are	1
inserted,	1
and	1
the	1
keel	1
is	1
otherwise,	1
for	1
the	1
time,	1
but	1
a	1
long,	1
disconnected	1
timber.	1
The	1
ribs	1
were	1
ten	1
on	1
a	1
side.	1
The	1
first,	1
to	1
begin	1
from	1
the	1
neck,	1
was	1
nearly	1
six	1
feet	1
long;	1
the	1
second,	1
third,	1
and	1
fourth	1
were	1
each	1
successively	1
longer,	1
till	1
you	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
climax	1
of	1
the	1
fifth,	1
or	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
middle	1
ribs,	1
which	1
measured	1
eight	1
feet	1
and	1
some	1
inches.	1
From	1
that	1
part,	1
the	1
remaining	1
ribs	1
diminished,	1
till	1
the	1
tenth	1
and	1
last	1
only	1
spanned	1
five	1
feet	1
and	1
some	1
inches.	1
In	1
general	1
thickness,	1
they	1
all	1
bore	1
a	1
seemly	1
correspondence	1
to	1
their	1
length.	1
The	1
middle	1
ribs	1
were	1
the	1
most	1
arched.	1
In	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
Arsacides	1
they	1
are	1
used	1
for	1
beams	1
whereon	1
to	1
lay	1
footpath	1
bridges	1
over	1
small	1
streams.	1
In	1
considering	1
these	1
ribs,	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
be	1
struck	1
anew	1
with	1
the	1
circumstance,	1
so	1
variously	1
repeated	1
in	1
this	1
book,	1
that	1
the	1
skeleton	1
of	1
the	1
whale	1
is	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
the	1
mould	1
of	1
his	1
invested	1
form.	1
The	1
largest	1
of	1
the	1
Tranque	1
ribs,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
middle	1
ones,	1
occupied	1
that	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
fish	1
which,	1
in	1
life,	1
is	1
greatest	1
in	1
depth.	1
Now,	1
the	1
greatest	1
depth	1
of	1
the	1
invested	1
body	1
of	1
this	1
particular	1
whale	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
at	1
least	1
sixteen	1
feet;	1
whereas,	1
the	1
corresponding	1
rib	1
measured	1
but	1
little	1
more	1
than	1
eight	1
feet.	1
So	1
that	1
this	1
rib	1
only	1
conveyed	1
half	1
of	1
the	1
true	1
notion	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
magnitude	1
of	1
that	1
part.	1
Besides,	1
for	1
some	1
way,	1
where	1
I	1
now	1
saw	1
but	1
a	1
naked	1
spine,	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
once	1
wrapped	1
round	1
with	1
tons	1
of	1
added	1
bulk	1
in	1
flesh,	1
muscle,	1
blood,	1
and	1
bowels.	1
Still	1
more,	1
for	1
the	1
ample	1
fins,	1
I	1
here	1
saw	1
but	1
a	1
few	1
disordered	1
joints;	1
and	1
in	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
weighty	1
and	1
majestic,	1
but	1
boneless	1
flukes,	1
an	1
utter	1
blank!	1
How	1
vain	1
and	1
foolish,	1
then,	1
thought	1
I,	1
for	1
timid	1
untravelled	1
man	1
to	1
try	1
to	1
comprehend	1
aright	1
this	1
wondrous	1
whale,	1
by	1
merely	1
poring	1
over	1
his	1
dead	1
attenuated	1
skeleton,	1
stretched	1
in	1
this	1
peaceful	1
wood.	1
No.	1
Only	1
in	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
quickest	1
perils;	1
only	1
when	1
within	1
the	1
eddyings	1
of	1
his	1
angry	1
flukes;	1
only	1
on	1
the	1
profound	1
unbounded	1
sea,	1
can	1
the	1
fully	1
invested	1
whale	1
be	1
truly	1
and	1
livingly	1
found	1
out.	1
But	1
the	1
spine.	1
For	1
that,	1
the	1
best	1
way	1
we	1
can	1
consider	1
it	1
is,	1
with	1
a	1
crane,	1
to	1
pile	1
its	1
bones	1
high	1
up	1
on	1
end.	1
No	1
speedy	1
enterprise.	1
But	1
now	1
it's	1
done,	1
it	1
looks	1
much	1
like	1
Pompey's	1
Pillar.	1
There	1
are	1
forty	1
and	1
odd	1
vertebrae	1
in	1
all,	1
which	1
in	1
the	1
skeleton	1
are	1
not	1
locked	1
together.	1
They	1
mostly	1
lie	1
like	1
the	1
great	1
knobbed	1
blocks	1
on	1
a	1
Gothic	1
spire,	1
forming	1
solid	1
courses	1
of	1
heavy	1
masonry.	1
The	1
largest,	1
a	1
middle	1
one,	1
is	1
in	1
width	1
something	1
less	1
than	1
three	1
feet,	1
and	1
in	1
depth	1
more	1
than	1
four.	1
The	1
smallest,	1
where	1
the	1
spine	1
tapers	1
away	1
into	1
the	1
tail,	1
is	1
only	1
two	1
inches	1
in	1
width,	1
and	1
looks	1
something	1
like	1
a	1
white	1
billiard-ball.	1
I	1
was	1
told	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
still	1
smaller	1
ones,	1
but	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
lost	1
by	1
some	1
little	1
cannibal	1
urchins,	1
the	1
priest's	1
children,	1
who	1
had	1
stolen	1
them	1
to	1
play	1
marbles	1
with.	1
Thus	1
we	1
see	1
how	1
that	1
the	1
spine	1
of	1
even	1
the	1
hugest	1
of	1
living	1
things	1
tapers	1
off	1
at	1
last	1
into	1
simple	1
child's	1
play.	1
CHAPTER	1
104	1
The	1
Fossil	1
Whale.	1
From	1
his	1
mighty	1
bulk	1
the	1
whale	1
affords	1
a	1
most	1
congenial	1
theme	1
whereon	1
to	1
enlarge,	1
amplify,	1
and	1
generally	1
expatiate.	1
Would	1
you,	1
you	1
could	1
not	1
compress	1
him.	1
By	1
good	1
rights	1
he	1
should	1
only	1
be	1
treated	1
of	1
in	1
imperial	1
folio.	1
Not	1
to	1
tell	1
over	1
again	1
his	1
furlongs	1
from	1
spiracle	1
to	1
tail,	1
and	1
the	1
yards	1
he	1
measures	1
about	1
the	1
waist;	1
only	1
think	1
of	1
the	1
gigantic	1
involutions	1
of	1
his	1
intestines,	1
where	1
they	1
lie	1
in	1
him	1
like	1
great	1
cables	1
and	1
hawsers	1
coiled	1
away	1
in	1
the	1
subterranean	1
orlop-deck	1
of	1
a	1
line-of-battle-ship.	1
Since	1
I	1
have	1
undertaken	1
to	1
manhandle	1
this	1
Leviathan,	1
it	1
behooves	1
me	1
to	1
approve	1
myself	1
omnisciently	1
exhaustive	1
in	1
the	1
enterprise;	1
not	1
overlooking	1
the	1
minutest	1
seminal	1
germs	1
of	1
his	1
blood,	1
and	1
spinning	1
him	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
uttermost	1
coil	1
of	1
his	1
bowels.	1
Having	1
already	1
described	1
him	1
in	1
most	1
of	1
his	1
present	1
habitatory	1
and	1
anatomical	1
peculiarities,	1
it	1
now	1
remains	1
to	1
magnify	1
him	1
in	1
an	1
archaeological,	1
fossiliferous,	1
and	1
antediluvian	1
point	1
of	1
view.	1
Applied	1
to	1
any	1
other	1
creature	1
than	1
the	1
Leviathan--to	1
an	1
ant	1
or	1
a	1
flea--such	1
portly	1
terms	1
might	1
justly	1
be	1
deemed	1
unwarrantably	1
grandiloquent.	1
But	1
when	1
Leviathan	1
is	1
the	1
text,	1
the	1
case	1
is	1
altered.	1
Fain	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
stagger	1
to	1
this	1
emprise	1
under	1
the	1
weightiest	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
dictionary.	1
And	1
here	1
be	1
it	1
said,	1
that	1
whenever	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
convenient	1
to	1
consult	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
these	1
dissertations,	1
I	1
have	1
invariably	1
used	1
a	1
huge	1
quarto	1
edition	1
of	1
Johnson,	1
expressly	1
purchased	1
for	1
that	1
purpose;	1
because	1
that	1
famous	1
lexicographer's	1
uncommon	1
personal	1
bulk	1
more	1
fitted	1
him	1
to	1
compile	1
a	1
lexicon	1
to	1
be	1
used	1
by	1
a	1
whale	1
author	1
like	1
me.	1
One	1
often	1
hears	1
of	1
writers	1
that	1
rise	1
and	1
swell	1
with	1
their	1
subject,	1
though	1
it	1
may	1
seem	1
but	1
an	1
ordinary	1
one.	1
How,	1
then,	1
with	1
me,	1
writing	1
of	1
this	1
Leviathan?	1
Unconsciously	1
my	1
chirography	1
expands	1
into	1
placard	1
capitals.	1
Give	1
me	1
a	1
condor's	1
quill!	1
Give	1
me	1
Vesuvius'	1
crater	1
for	1
an	1
inkstand!	1
Friends,	1
hold	1
my	1
arms!	1
For	1
in	1
the	1
mere	1
act	1
of	1
penning	1
my	1
thoughts	1
of	1
this	1
Leviathan,	1
they	1
weary	1
me,	1
and	1
make	1
me	1
faint	1
with	1
their	1
outreaching	1
comprehensiveness	1
of	1
sweep,	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
include	1
the	1
whole	1
circle	1
of	1
the	1
sciences,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
generations	1
of	1
whales,	1
and	1
men,	1
and	1
mastodons,	1
past,	1
present,	1
and	1
to	1
come,	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
revolving	1
panoramas	1
of	1
empire	1
on	1
earth,	1
and	1
throughout	1
the	1
whole	1
universe,	1
not	1
excluding	1
its	1
suburbs.	1
Such,	1
and	1
so	1
magnifying,	1
is	1
the	1
virtue	1
of	1
a	1
large	1
and	1
liberal	1
theme!	1
We	1
expand	1
to	1
its	1
bulk.	1
To	1
produce	1
a	1
mighty	1
book,	1
you	1
must	1
choose	1
a	1
mighty	1
theme.	1
No	1
great	1
and	1
enduring	1
volume	1
can	1
ever	1
be	1
written	1
on	1
the	1
flea,	1
though	1
many	1
there	1
be	1
who	1
have	1
tried	1
it.	1
Ere	1
entering	1
upon	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
Fossil	1
Whales,	1
I	1
present	1
my	1
credentials	1
as	1
a	1
geologist,	1
by	1
stating	1
that	1
in	1
my	1
miscellaneous	1
time	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
stone-mason,	1
and	1
also	1
a	1
great	1
digger	1
of	1
ditches,	1
canals	1
and	1
wells,	1
wine-vaults,	1
cellars,	1
and	1
cisterns	1
of	1
all	1
sorts.	1
Likewise,	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
preliminary,	1
I	1
desire	1
to	1
remind	1
the	1
reader,	1
that	1
while	1
in	1
the	1
earlier	1
geological	1
strata	1
there	1
are	1
found	1
the	1
fossils	1
of	1
monsters	1
now	1
almost	1
completely	1
extinct;	1
the	1
subsequent	1
relics	1
discovered	1
in	1
what	1
are	1
called	1
the	1
Tertiary	1
formations	1
seem	1
the	1
connecting,	1
or	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
intercepted	1
links,	1
between	1
the	1
antichronical	1
creatures,	1
and	1
those	1
whose	1
remote	1
posterity	1
are	1
said	1
to	1
have	1
entered	1
the	1
Ark;	1
all	1
the	1
Fossil	1
Whales	1
hitherto	1
discovered	1
belong	1
to	1
the	1
Tertiary	1
period,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
last	1
preceding	1
the	1
superficial	1
formations.	1
And	1
though	1
none	1
of	1
them	1
precisely	1
answer	1
to	1
any	1
known	1
species	1
of	1
the	1
present	1
time,	1
they	1
are	1
yet	1
sufficiently	1
akin	1
to	1
them	1
in	1
general	1
respects,	1
to	1
justify	1
their	1
taking	1
rank	1
as	1
Cetacean	1
fossils.	1
Detached	1
broken	1
fossils	1
of	1
pre-adamite	1
whales,	1
fragments	1
of	1
their	1
bones	1
and	1
skeletons,	1
have	1
within	1
thirty	1
years	1
past,	1
at	1
various	1
intervals,	1
been	1
found	1
at	1
the	1
base	1
of	1
the	1
Alps,	1
in	1
Lombardy,	1
in	1
France,	1
in	1
England,	1
in	1
Scotland,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
States	1
of	1
Louisiana,	1
Mississippi,	1
and	1
Alabama.	1
Among	1
the	1
more	1
curious	1
of	1
such	1
remains	1
is	1
part	1
of	1
a	1
skull,	1
which	1
in	1
the	1
year	1
1779	1
was	1
disinterred	1
in	1
the	1
Rue	1
Dauphine	1
in	1
Paris,	1
a	1
short	1
street	1
opening	1
almost	1
directly	1
upon	1
the	1
palace	1
of	1
the	1
Tuileries;	1
and	1
bones	1
disinterred	1
in	1
excavating	1
the	1
great	1
docks	1
of	1
Antwerp,	1
in	1
Napoleon's	1
time.	1
Cuvier	1
pronounced	1
these	1
fragments	1
to	1
have	1
belonged	1
to	1
some	1
utterly	1
unknown	1
Leviathanic	1
species.	1
But	1
by	1
far	1
the	1
most	1
wonderful	1
of	1
all	1
Cetacean	1
relics	1
was	1
the	1
almost	1
complete	1
vast	1
skeleton	1
of	1
an	1
extinct	1
monster,	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
year	1
1842,	1
on	1
the	1
plantation	1
of	1
Judge	1
Creagh,	1
in	1
Alabama.	1
The	1
awe-stricken	1
credulous	1
slaves	1
in	1
the	1
vicinity	1
took	1
it	1
for	1
the	1
bones	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
fallen	1
angels.	1
The	1
Alabama	1
doctors	1
declared	1
it	1
a	1
huge	1
reptile,	1
and	1
bestowed	1
upon	1
it	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Basilosaurus.	1
But	1
some	1
specimen	1
bones	1
of	1
it	1
being	1
taken	1
across	1
the	1
sea	1
to	1
Owen,	1
the	1
English	1
Anatomist,	1
it	1
turned	1
out	1
that	1
this	1
alleged	1
reptile	1
was	1
a	1
whale,	1
though	1
of	1
a	1
departed	1
species.	1
A	1
significant	1
illustration	1
of	1
the	1
fact,	1
again	1
and	1
again	1
repeated	1
in	1
this	1
book,	1
that	1
the	1
skeleton	1
of	1
the	1
whale	1
furnishes	1
but	1
little	1
clue	1
to	1
the	1
shape	1
of	1
his	1
fully	1
invested	1
body.	1
So	1
Owen	1
rechristened	1
the	1
monster	1
Zeuglodon;	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
paper	1
read	1
before	1
the	1
London	1
Geological	1
Society,	1
pronounced	1
it,	1
in	1
substance,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
extraordinary	1
creatures	1
which	1
the	1
mutations	1
of	1
the	1
globe	1
have	1
blotted	1
out	1
of	1
existence.	1
When	1
I	1
stand	1
among	1
these	1
mighty	1
Leviathan	1
skeletons,	1
skulls,	1
tusks,	1
jaws,	1
ribs,	1
and	1
vertebrae,	1
all	1
characterized	1
by	1
partial	1
resemblances	1
to	1
the	1
existing	1
breeds	1
of	1
sea-monsters;	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
bearing	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
hand	1
similar	1
affinities	1
to	1
the	1
annihilated	1
antichronical	1
Leviathans,	1
their	1
incalculable	1
seniors;	1
I	1
am,	1
by	1
a	1
flood,	1
borne	1
back	1
to	1
that	1
wondrous	1
period,	1
ere	1
time	1
itself	1
can	1
be	1
said	1
to	1
have	1
begun;	1
for	1
time	1
began	1
with	1
man.	1
Here	1
Saturn's	1
grey	1
chaos	1
rolls	1
over	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
obtain	1
dim,	1
shuddering	1
glimpses	1
into	1
those	1
Polar	1
eternities;	1
when	1
wedged	1
bastions	1
of	1
ice	1
pressed	1
hard	1
upon	1
what	1
are	1
now	1
the	1
Tropics;	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
25,000	1
miles	1
of	1
this	1
world's	1
circumference,	1
not	1
an	1
inhabitable	1
hand's	1
breadth	1
of	1
land	1
was	1
visible.	1
Then	1
the	1
whole	1
world	1
was	1
the	1
whale's;	1
and,	1
king	1
of	1
creation,	1
he	1
left	1
his	1
wake	1
along	1
the	1
present	1
lines	1
of	1
the	1
Andes	1
and	1
the	1
Himmalehs.	1
Who	1
can	1
show	1
a	1
pedigree	1
like	1
Leviathan?	1
Ahab's	1
harpoon	1
had	1
shed	1
older	1
blood	1
than	1
the	1
Pharaoh's.	1
Methuselah	1
seems	1
a	1
school-boy.	1
I	1
look	1
round	1
to	1
shake	1
hands	1
with	1
Shem.	1
I	1
am	1
horror-struck	1
at	1
this	1
antemosaic,	1
unsourced	1
existence	1
of	1
the	1
unspeakable	1
terrors	1
of	1
the	1
whale,	1
which,	1
having	1
been	1
before	1
all	1
time,	1
must	1
needs	1
exist	1
after	1
all	1
humane	1
ages	1
are	1
over.	1
But	1
not	1
alone	1
has	1
this	1
Leviathan	1
left	1
his	1
pre-adamite	1
traces	1
in	1
the	1
stereotype	1
plates	1
of	1
nature,	1
and	1
in	1
limestone	1
and	1
marl	1
bequeathed	1
his	1
ancient	1
bust;	1
but	1
upon	1
Egyptian	1
tablets,	1
whose	1
antiquity	1
seems	1
to	1
claim	1
for	1
them	1
an	1
almost	1
fossiliferous	1
character,	1
we	1
find	1
the	1
unmistakable	1
print	1
of	1
his	1
fin.	1
In	1
an	1
apartment	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
temple	1
of	1
Denderah,	1
some	1
fifty	1
years	1
ago,	1
there	1
was	1
discovered	1
upon	1
the	1
granite	1
ceiling	1
a	1
sculptured	1
and	1
painted	1
planisphere,	1
abounding	1
in	1
centaurs,	1
griffins,	1
and	1
dolphins,	1
similar	1
to	1
the	1
grotesque	1
figures	1
on	1
the	1
celestial	1
globe	1
of	1
the	1
moderns.	1
Gliding	1
among	1
them,	1
old	1
Leviathan	1
swam	1
as	1
of	1
yore;	1
was	1
there	1
swimming	1
in	1
that	1
planisphere,	1
centuries	1
before	1
Solomon	1
was	1
cradled.	1
Nor	1
must	1
there	1
be	1
omitted	1
another	1
strange	1
attestation	1
of	1
the	1
antiquity	1
of	1
the	1
whale,	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
osseous	1
post-diluvian	1
reality,	1
as	1
set	1
down	1
by	1
the	1
venerable	1
John	1
Leo,	1
the	1
old	1
Barbary	1
traveller.	1
"Not	1
far	1
from	1
the	1
Sea-side,	1
they	1
have	1
a	1
Temple,	1
the	1
Rafters	1
and	1
Beams	1
of	1
which	1
are	1
made	1
of	1
Whale-Bones;	1
for	1
Whales	1
of	1
a	1
monstrous	1
size	1
are	1
oftentimes	1
cast	1
up	1
dead	1
upon	1
that	1
shore.	1
The	1
Common	1
People	1
imagine,	1
that	1
by	1
a	1
secret	1
Power	1
bestowed	1
by	1
God	1
upon	1
the	1
temple,	1
no	1
Whale	1
can	1
pass	1
it	1
without	1
immediate	1
death.	1
But	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
the	1
Matter	1
is,	1
that	1
on	1
either	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
Temple,	1
there	1
are	1
Rocks	1
that	1
shoot	1
two	1
Miles	1
into	1
the	1
Sea,	1
and	1
wound	1
the	1
Whales	1
when	1
they	1
light	1
upon	1
'em.	1
They	1
keep	1
a	1
Whale's	1
Rib	1
of	1
an	1
incredible	1
length	1
for	1
a	1
Miracle,	1
which	1
lying	1
upon	1
the	1
Ground	1
with	1
its	1
convex	1
part	1
uppermost,	1
makes	1
an	1
Arch,	1
the	1
Head	1
of	1
which	1
cannot	1
be	1
reached	1
by	1
a	1
Man	1
upon	1
a	1
Camel's	1
Back.	1
This	1
Rib	1
(says	1
John	1
Leo)	1
is	1
said	1
to	1
have	1
layn	1
there	1
a	1
hundred	1
Years	1
before	1
I	1
saw	1
it.	1
Their	1
Historians	1
affirm,	1
that	1
a	1
Prophet	1
who	1
prophesy'd	1
of	1
Mahomet,	1
came	1
from	1
this	1
Temple,	1
and	1
some	1
do	1
not	1
stand	1
to	1
assert,	1
that	1
the	1
Prophet	1
Jonas	1
was	1
cast	1
forth	1
by	1
the	1
Whale	1
at	1
the	1
Base	1
of	1
the	1
Temple."	1
In	1
this	1
Afric	1
Temple	1
of	1
the	1
Whale	1
I	1
leave	1
you,	1
reader,	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
be	1
a	1
Nantucketer,	1
and	1
a	1
whaleman,	1
you	1

CHAPTER	1
105	1
Does	1
the	1
Whale's	1
Magnitude	1
Diminish?--Will	1
He	1
Perish?	1
Inasmuch,	1
then,	1
as	1
this	1
Leviathan	1
comes	1
floundering	1
down	1
upon	1
us	1
from	1
the	1
head-waters	1
of	1
the	1
Eternities,	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
fitly	1
inquired,	1
whether,	1
in	1
the	1
long	1
course	1
of	1
his	1
generations,	1
he	1
has	1
not	1
degenerated	1
from	1
the	1
original	1
bulk	1
of	1
his	1
sires.	1
But	1
upon	1
investigation	1
we	1
find,	1
that	1
not	1
only	1
are	1
the	1
whales	1
of	1
the	1
present	1
day	1
superior	1
in	1
magnitude	1
to	1
those	1
whose	1
fossil	1
remains	1
are	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
Tertiary	1
system	1
(embracing	1
a	1
distinct	1
geological	1
period	1
prior	1
to	1
man),	1
but	1
of	1
the	1
whales	1
found	1
in	1
that	1
Tertiary	1
system,	1
those	1
belonging	1
to	1
its	1
latter	1
formations	1
exceed	1
in	1
size	1
those	1
of	1
its	1
earlier	1
ones.	1
Of	1
all	1
the	1
pre-adamite	1
whales	1
yet	1
exhumed,	1
by	1
far	1
the	1
largest	1
is	1
the	1
Alabama	1
one	1
mentioned	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
chapter,	1
and	1
that	1
was	1
less	1
than	1
seventy	1
feet	1
in	1
length	1
in	1
the	1
skeleton.	1
Whereas,	1
we	1
have	1
already	1
seen,	1
that	1
the	1
tape-measure	1
gives	1
seventy-two	1
feet	1
for	1
the	1
skeleton	1
of	1
a	1
large	1
sized	1
modern	1
whale.	1
And	1
I	1
have	1
heard,	1
on	1
whalemen's	1
authority,	1
that	1
Sperm	1
Whales	1
have	1
been	1
captured	1
near	1
a	1
hundred	1
feet	1
long	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
capture.	1
But	1
may	1
it	1
not	1
be,	1
that	1
while	1
the	1
whales	1
of	1
the	1
present	1
hour	1
are	1
an	1
advance	1
in	1
magnitude	1
upon	1
those	1
of	1
all	1
previous	1
geological	1
periods;	1
may	1
it	1
not	1
be,	1
that	1
since	1
Adam's	1
time	1
they	1
have	1
degenerated?	1
Assuredly,	1
we	1
must	1
conclude	1
so,	1
if	1
we	1
are	1
to	1
credit	1
the	1
accounts	1
of	1
such	1
gentlemen	1
as	1
Pliny,	1
and	1
the	1
ancient	1
naturalists	1
generally.	1
For	1
Pliny	1
tells	1
us	1
of	1
Whales	1
that	1
embraced	1
acres	1
of	1
living	1
bulk,	1
and	1
Aldrovandus	1
of	1
others	1
which	1
measured	1
eight	1
hundred	1
feet	1
in	1
length--Rope	1
Walks	1
and	1
Thames	1
Tunnels	1
of	1
Whales!	1
And	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Banks	1
and	1
Solander,	1
Cooke's	1
naturalists,	1
we	1
find	1
a	1
Danish	1
member	1
of	1
the	1
Academy	1
of	1
Sciences	1
setting	1
down	1
certain	1
Iceland	1
Whales	1
(reydan-siskur,	1
or	1
Wrinkled	1
Bellies)	1
at	1
one	1
hundred	1
and	1
twenty	1
yards;	1
that	1
is,	1
three	1
hundred	1
and	1
sixty	1
feet.	1
And	1
Lacepede,	1
the	1
French	1
naturalist,	1
in	1
his	1
elaborate	1
history	1
of	1
whales,	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
beginning	1
of	1
his	1
work	1
(page	1
3),	1
sets	1
down	1
the	1
Right	1
Whale	1
at	1
one	1
hundred	1
metres,	1
three	1
hundred	1
and	1
twenty-eight	1
feet.	1
And	1
this	1
work	1
was	1
published	1
so	1
late	1
as	1
A.D.	1
1825.	1
But	1
will	1
any	1
whaleman	1
believe	1
these	1
stories?	1
No.	1
The	1
whale	1
of	1
to-day	1
is	1
as	1
big	1
as	1
his	1
ancestors	1
in	1
Pliny's	1
time.	1
And	1
if	1
ever	1
I	1
go	1
where	1
Pliny	1
is,	1
I,	1
a	1
whaleman	1
(more	1
than	1
he	1
was),	1
will	1
make	1
bold	1
to	1
tell	1
him	1
so.	1
Because	1
I	1
cannot	1
understand	1
how	1
it	1
is,	1
that	1
while	1
the	1
Egyptian	1
mummies	1
that	1
were	1
buried	1
thousands	1
of	1
years	1
before	1
even	1
Pliny	1
was	1
born,	1
do	1
not	1
measure	1
so	1
much	1
in	1
their	1
coffins	1
as	1
a	1
modern	1
Kentuckian	1
in	1
his	1
socks;	1
and	1
while	1
the	1
cattle	1
and	1
other	1
animals	1
sculptured	1
on	1
the	1
oldest	1
Egyptian	1
and	1
Nineveh	1
tablets,	1
by	1
the	1
relative	1
proportions	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
are	1
drawn,	1
just	1
as	1
plainly	1
prove	1
that	1
the	1
high-bred,	1
stall-fed,	1
prize	1
cattle	1
of	1
Smithfield,	1
not	1
only	1
equal,	1
but	1
far	1
exceed	1
in	1
magnitude	1
the	1
fattest	1
of	1
Pharaoh's	1
fat	1
kine;	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
all	1
this,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
admit	1
that	1
of	1
all	1
animals	1
the	1
whale	1
alone	1
should	1
have	1
degenerated.	1
But	1
still	1
another	1
inquiry	1
remains;	1
one	1
often	1
agitated	1
by	1
the	1
more	1
recondite	1
Nantucketers.	1
Whether	1
owing	1
to	1
the	1
almost	1
omniscient	1
look-outs	1
at	1
the	1
mast-heads	1
of	1
the	1
whaleships,	1
now	1
penetrating	1
even	1
through	1
Behring's	1
straits,	1
and	1
into	1
the	1
remotest	1
secret	1
drawers	1
and	1
lockers	1
of	1
the	1
world;	1
and	1
the	1
thousand	1
harpoons	1
and	1
lances	1
darted	1
along	1
all	1
continental	1
coasts;	1
the	1
moot	1
point	1
is,	1
whether	1
Leviathan	1
can	1
long	1
endure	1
so	1
wide	1
a	1
chase,	1
and	1
so	1
remorseless	1
a	1
havoc;	1
whether	1
he	1
must	1
not	1
at	1
last	1
be	1
exterminated	1
from	1
the	1
waters,	1
and	1
the	1
last	1
whale,	1
like	1
the	1
last	1
man,	1
smoke	1
his	1
last	1
pipe,	1
and	1
then	1
himself	1
evaporate	1
in	1
the	1
final	1
puff.	1
Comparing	1
the	1
humped	1
herds	1
of	1
whales	1
with	1
the	1
humped	1
herds	1
of	1
buffalo,	1
which,	1
not	1
forty	1
years	1
ago,	1
overspread	1
by	1
tens	1
of	1
thousands	1
the	1
prairies	1
of	1
Illinois	1
and	1
Missouri,	1
and	1
shook	1
their	1
iron	1
manes	1
and	1
scowled	1
with	1
their	1
thunder-clotted	1
brows	1
upon	1
the	1
sites	1
of	1
populous	1
river-capitals,	1
where	1
now	1
the	1
polite	1
broker	1
sells	1
you	1
land	1
at	1
a	1
dollar	1
an	1
inch;	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
comparison	1
an	1
irresistible	1
argument	1
would	1
seem	1
furnished,	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
the	1
hunted	1
whale	1
cannot	1
now	1
escape	1
speedy	1
extinction.	1
But	1
you	1
must	1
look	1
at	1
this	1
matter	1
in	1
every	1
light.	1
Though	1
so	1
short	1
a	1
period	1
ago--not	1
a	1
good	1
lifetime--the	1
census	1
of	1
the	1
buffalo	1
in	1
Illinois	1
exceeded	1
the	1
census	1
of	1
men	1
now	1
in	1
London,	1
and	1
though	1
at	1
the	1
present	1
day	1
not	1
one	1
horn	1
or	1
hoof	1
of	1
them	1
remains	1
in	1
all	1
that	1
region;	1
and	1
though	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
this	1
wondrous	1
extermination	1
was	1
the	1
spear	1
of	1
man;	1
yet	1
the	1
far	1
different	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
whale-hunt	1
peremptorily	1
forbids	1
so	1
inglorious	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
the	1
Leviathan.	1
Forty	1
men	1
in	1
one	1
ship	1
hunting	1
the	1
Sperm	1
Whales	1
for	1
forty-eight	1
months	1
think	1
they	1
have	1
done	1
extremely	1
well,	1
and	1
thank	1
God,	1
if	1
at	1
last	1
they	1
carry	1
home	1
the	1
oil	1
of	1
forty	1
fish.	1
Whereas,	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
Canadian	1
and	1
Indian	1
hunters	1
and	1
trappers	1
of	1
the	1
West,	1
when	1
the	1
far	1
west	1
(in	1
whose	1
sunset	1
suns	1
still	1
rise)	1
was	1
a	1
wilderness	1
and	1
a	1
virgin,	1
the	1
same	1
number	1
of	1
moccasined	1
men,	1
for	1
the	1
same	1
number	1
of	1
months,	1
mounted	1
on	1
horse	1
instead	1
of	1
sailing	1
in	1
ships,	1
would	1
have	1
slain	1
not	1
forty,	1
but	1
forty	1
thousand	1
and	1
more	1
buffaloes;	1
a	1
fact	1
that,	1
if	1
need	1
were,	1
could	1
be	1
statistically	1
stated.	1
Nor,	1
considered	1
aright,	1
does	1
it	1
seem	1
any	1
argument	1
in	1
favour	1
of	1
the	1
gradual	1
extinction	1
of	1
the	1
Sperm	1
Whale,	1
for	1
example,	1
that	1
in	1
former	1
years	1
(the	1
latter	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
last	1
century,	1
say)	1
these	1
Leviathans,	1
in	1
small	1
pods,	1
were	1
encountered	1
much	1
oftener	1
than	1
at	1
present,	1
and,	1
in	1
consequence,	1
the	1
voyages	1
were	1
not	1
so	1
prolonged,	1
and	1
were	1
also	1
much	1
more	1
remunerative.	1
Because,	1
as	1
has	1
been	1
elsewhere	1
noticed,	1
those	1
whales,	1
influenced	1
by	1
some	1
views	1
to	1
safety,	1
now	1
swim	1
the	1
seas	1
in	1
immense	1
caravans,	1
so	1
that	1
to	1
a	1
large	1
degree	1
the	1
scattered	1
solitaries,	1
yokes,	1
and	1
pods,	1
and	1
schools	1
of	1
other	1
days	1
are	1
now	1
aggregated	1
into	1
vast	1
but	1
widely	1
separated,	1
unfrequent	1
armies.	1
That	1
is	1
all.	1
And	1
equally	1
fallacious	1
seems	1
the	1
conceit,	1
that	1
because	1
the	1
so-called	1
whale-bone	1
whales	1
no	1
longer	1
haunt	1
many	1
grounds	1
in	1
former	1
years	1
abounding	1
with	1
them,	1
hence	1
that	1
species	1
also	1
is	1
declining.	1
For	1
they	1
are	1
only	1
being	1
driven	1
from	1
promontory	1
to	1
cape;	1
and	1
if	1
one	1
coast	1
is	1
no	1
longer	1
enlivened	1
with	1
their	1
jets,	1
then,	1
be	1
sure,	1
some	1
other	1
and	1
remoter	1
strand	1
has	1
been	1
very	1
recently	1
startled	1
by	1
the	1
unfamiliar	1
spectacle.	1
Furthermore:	1
concerning	1
these	1
last	1
mentioned	1
Leviathans,	1
they	1
have	1
two	1
firm	1
fortresses,	1
which,	1
in	1
all	1
human	1
probability,	1
will	1
for	1
ever	1
remain	1
impregnable.	1
And	1
as	1
upon	1
the	1
invasion	1
of	1
their	1
valleys,	1
the	1
frosty	1
Swiss	1
have	1
retreated	1
to	1
their	1
mountains;	1
so,	1
hunted	1
from	1
the	1
savannas	1
and	1
glades	1
of	1
the	1
middle	1
seas,	1
the	1
whale-bone	1
whales	1
can	1
at	1
last	1
resort	1
to	1
their	1
Polar	1
citadels,	1
and	1
diving	1
under	1
the	1
ultimate	1
glassy	1
barriers	1
and	1
walls	1
there,	1
come	1
up	1
among	1
icy	1
fields	1
and	1
floes;	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
charmed	1
circle	1
of	1
everlasting	1
December,	1
bid	1
defiance	1
to	1
all	1
pursuit	1
from	1
man.	1
But	1
as	1
perhaps	1
fifty	1
of	1
these	1
whale-bone	1
whales	1
are	1
harpooned	1
for	1
one	1
cachalot,	1
some	1
philosophers	1
of	1
the	1
forecastle	1
have	1
concluded	1
that	1
this	1
positive	1
havoc	1
has	1
already	1
very	1
seriously	1
diminished	1
their	1
battalions.	1
But	1
though	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
past	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
these	1
whales,	1
not	1
less	1
than	1
13,000,	1
have	1
been	1
annually	1
slain	1
on	1
the	1
nor'-west	1
coast	1
by	1
the	1
Americans	1
alone;	1
yet	1
there	1
are	1
considerations	1
which	1
render	1
even	1
this	1
circumstance	1
of	1
little	1
or	1
no	1
account	1
as	1
an	1
opposing	1
argument	1
in	1
this	1
matter.	1
Natural	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
somewhat	1
incredulous	1
concerning	1
the	1
populousness	1
of	1
the	1
more	1
enormous	1
creatures	1
of	1
the	1
globe,	1
yet	1
what	1
shall	1
we	1
say	1
to	1
Harto,	1
the	1
historian	1
of	1
Goa,	1
when	1
he	1
tells	1
us	1
that	1
at	1
one	1
hunting	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
Siam	1
took	1
4,000	1
elephants;	1
that	1
in	1
those	1
regions	1
elephants	1
are	1
numerous	1
as	1
droves	1
of	1
cattle	1
in	1
the	1
temperate	1
climes.	1
And	1
there	1
seems	1
no	1
reason	1
to	1
doubt	1
that	1
if	1
these	1
elephants,	1
which	1
have	1
now	1
been	1
hunted	1
for	1
thousands	1
of	1
years,	1
by	1
Semiramis,	1
by	1
Porus,	1
by	1
Hannibal,	1
and	1
by	1
all	1
the	1
successive	1
monarchs	1
of	1
the	1
East--if	1
they	1
still	1
survive	1
there	1
in	1
great	1
numbers,	1
much	1
more	1
may	1
the	1
great	1
whale	1
outlast	1
all	1
hunting,	1
since	1
he	1
has	1
a	1
pasture	1
to	1
expatiate	1
in,	1
which	1
is	1
precisely	1
twice	1
as	1
large	1
as	1
all	1
Asia,	1
both	1
Americas,	1
Europe	1
and	1
Africa,	1
New	1
Holland,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
Isles	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
combined.	1
Moreover:	1
we	1
are	1
to	1
consider,	1
that	1
from	1
the	1
presumed	1
great	1
longevity	1
of	1
whales,	1
their	1
probably	1
attaining	1
the	1
age	1
of	1
a	1
century	1
and	1
more,	1
therefore	1
at	1
any	1
one	1
period	1
of	1
time,	1
several	1
distinct	1
adult	1
generations	1
must	1
be	1
contemporary.	1
And	1
what	1
that	1
is,	1
we	1
may	1
soon	1
gain	1
some	1
idea	1
of,	1
by	1
imagining	1
all	1
the	1
grave-yards,	1
cemeteries,	1
and	1
family	1
vaults	1
of	1
creation	1
yielding	1
up	1
the	1
live	1
bodies	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
men,	1
women,	1
and	1
children	1
who	1
were	1
alive	1
seventy-five	1
years	1
ago;	1
and	1
adding	1
this	1
countless	1
host	1
to	1
the	1
present	1
human	1
population	1
of	1
the	1
globe.	1
Wherefore,	1
for	1
all	1
these	1
things,	1
we	1
account	1
the	1
whale	1
immortal	1
in	1
his	1
species,	1
however	1
perishable	1
in	1
his	1
individuality.	1
He	1
swam	1
the	1
seas	1
before	1
the	1
continents	1
broke	1
water;	1
he	1
once	1
swam	1
over	1
the	1
site	1
of	1
the	1
Tuileries,	1
and	1
Windsor	1
Castle,	1
and	1
the	1
Kremlin.	1
In	1
Noah's	1
flood	1
he	1
despised	1
Noah's	1
Ark;	1
and	1
if	1
ever	1
the	1
world	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
again	1
flooded,	1
like	1
the	1
Netherlands,	1
to	1
kill	1
off	1
its	1
rats,	1
then	1
the	1
eternal	1
whale	1
will	1
still	1
survive,	1
and	1
rearing	1
upon	1
the	1
topmost	1
crest	1
of	1
the	1
equatorial	1
flood,	1
spout	1
his	1
frothed	1
defiance	1
to	1
the	1
skies.	1
CHAPTER	1
106	1
Ahab's	1
Leg.	1
The	1
precipitating	1
manner	1
in	1
which	1
Captain	1
Ahab	1
had	1
quitted	1
the	1
Samuel	1
Enderby	1
of	1
London,	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
unattended	1
with	1
some	1
small	1
violence	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
person.	1
He	1
had	1
lighted	1
with	1
such	1
energy	1
upon	1
a	1
thwart	1
of	1
his	1
boat	1
that	1
his	1
ivory	1
leg	1
had	1
received	1
a	1
half-splintering	1
shock.	1
And	1
when	1
after	1
gaining	1
his	1
own	1
deck,	1
and	1
his	1
own	1
pivot-hole	1
there,	1
he	1
so	1
vehemently	1
wheeled	1
round	1
with	1
an	1
urgent	1
command	1
to	1
the	1
steersman	1
(it	1
was,	1
as	1
ever,	1
something	1
about	1
his	1
not	1
steering	1
inflexibly	1
enough);	1
then,	1
the	1
already	1
shaken	1
ivory	1
received	1
such	1
an	1
additional	1
twist	1
and	1
wrench,	1
that	1
though	1
it	1
still	1
remained	1
entire,	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
appearances	1
lusty,	1
yet	1
Ahab	1
did	1
not	1
deem	1
it	1
entirely	1
trustworthy.	1
And,	1
indeed,	1
it	1
seemed	1
small	1
matter	1
for	1
wonder,	1
that	1
for	1
all	1
his	1
pervading,	1
mad	1
recklessness,	1
Ahab	1
did	1
at	1
times	1
give	1
careful	1
heed	1
to	1
the	1
condition	1
of	1
that	1
dead	1
bone	1
upon	1
which	1
he	1
partly	1
stood.	1
For	1
it	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
very	1
long	1
prior	1
to	1
the	1
Pequod's	1
sailing	1
from	1
Nantucket,	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
found	1
one	1
night	1
lying	1
prone	1
upon	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
insensible;	1
by	1
some	1
unknown,	1
and	1
seemingly	1
inexplicable,	1
unimaginable	1
casualty,	1
his	1
ivory	1
limb	1
having	1
been	1
so	1
violently	1
displaced,	1
that	1
it	1
had	1
stake-wise	1
smitten,	1
and	1
all	1
but	1
pierced	1
his	1
groin;	1
nor	1
was	1
it	1
without	1
extreme	1
difficulty	1
that	1
the	1
agonizing	1
wound	1
was	1
entirely	1
cured.	1
Nor,	1
at	1
the	1
time,	1
had	1
it	1
failed	1
to	1
enter	1
his	1
monomaniac	1
mind,	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
anguish	1
of	1
that	1
then	1
present	1
suffering	1
was	1
but	1
the	1
direct	1
issue	1
of	1
a	1
former	1
woe;	1
and	1
he	1
too	1
plainly	1
seemed	1
to	1
see,	1
that	1
as	1
the	1
most	1
poisonous	1
reptile	1
of	1
the	1
marsh	1
perpetuates	1
his	1
kind	1
as	1
inevitably	1
as	1
the	1
sweetest	1
songster	1
of	1
the	1
grove;	1
so,	1
equally	1
with	1
every	1
felicity,	1
all	1
miserable	1
events	1
do	1
naturally	1
beget	1
their	1
like.	1
Yea,	1
more	1
than	1
equally,	1
thought	1
Ahab;	1
since	1
both	1
the	1
ancestry	1
and	1
posterity	1
of	1
Grief	1
go	1
further	1
than	1
the	1
ancestry	1
and	1
posterity	1
of	1
Joy.	1
For,	1
not	1
to	1
hint	1
of	1
this:	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
an	1
inference	1
from	1
certain	1
canonic	1
teachings,	1
that	1
while	1
some	1
natural	1
enjoyments	1
here	1
shall	1
have	1
no	1
children	1
born	1
to	1
them	1
for	1
the	1
other	1
world,	1
but,	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
shall	1
be	1
followed	1
by	1
the	1
joy-childlessness	1
of	1
all	1
hell's	1
despair;	1
whereas,	1
some	1
guilty	1
mortal	1
miseries	1
shall	1
still	1
fertilely	1
beget	1
to	1
themselves	1
an	1
eternally	1
progressive	1
progeny	1
of	1
griefs	1
beyond	1
the	1
grave;	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
to	1
hint	1
of	1
this,	1
there	1
still	1
seems	1
an	1
inequality	1
in	1
the	1
deeper	1
analysis	1
of	1
the	1
thing.	1
For,	1
thought	1
Ahab,	1
while	1
even	1
the	1
highest	1
earthly	1
felicities	1
ever	1
have	1
a	1
certain	1
unsignifying	1
pettiness	1
lurking	1
in	1
them,	1
but,	1
at	1
bottom,	1
all	1
heartwoes,	1
a	1
mystic	1
significance,	1
and,	1
in	1
some	1
men,	1
an	1
archangelic	1
grandeur;	1
so	1
do	1
their	1
diligent	1
tracings-out	1
not	1
belie	1
the	1
obvious	1
deduction.	1
To	1
trail	1
the	1
genealogies	1
of	1
these	1
high	1
mortal	1
miseries,	1
carries	1
us	1
at	1
last	1
among	1
the	1
sourceless	1
primogenitures	1
of	1
the	1
gods;	1
so	1
that,	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
glad,	1
hay-making	1
suns,	1
and	1
soft	1
cymballing,	1
round	1
harvest-moons,	1
we	1
must	1
needs	1
give	1
in	1
to	1
this:	1
that	1
the	1
gods	1
themselves	1
are	1
not	1
for	1
ever	1
glad.	1
The	1
ineffaceable,	1
sad	1
birth-mark	1
in	1
the	1
brow	1
of	1
man,	1
is	1
but	1
the	1
stamp	1
of	1
sorrow	1
in	1
the	1
signers.	1
Unwittingly	1
here	1
a	1
secret	1
has	1
been	1
divulged,	1
which	1
perhaps	1
might	1
more	1
properly,	1
in	1
set	1
way,	1
have	1
been	1
disclosed	1
before.	1
With	1
many	1
other	1
particulars	1
concerning	1
Ahab,	1
always	1
had	1
it	1
remained	1
a	1
mystery	1
to	1
some,	1
why	1
it	1
was,	1
that	1
for	1
a	1
certain	1
period,	1
both	1
before	1
and	1
after	1
the	1
sailing	1
of	1
the	1
Pequod,	1
he	1
had	1
hidden	1
himself	1
away	1
with	1
such	1
Grand-Lama-like	1
exclusiveness;	1
and,	1
for	1
that	1
one	1
interval,	1
sought	1
speechless	1
refuge,	1
as	1
it	1
were,	1
among	1
the	1
marble	1
senate	1
of	1
the	1
dead.	1
Captain	1
Peleg's	1
bruited	1
reason	1
for	1
this	1
thing	1
appeared	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
adequate;	1
though,	1
indeed,	1
as	1
touching	1
all	1
Ahab's	1
deeper	1
part,	1
every	1
revelation	1
partook	1
more	1
of	1
significant	1
darkness	1
than	1
of	1
explanatory	1
light.	1
But,	1
in	1
the	1
end,	1
it	1
all	1
came	1
out;	1
this	1
one	1
matter	1
did,	1
at	1
least.	1
That	1
direful	1
mishap	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
his	1
temporary	1
recluseness.	1
And	1
not	1
only	1
this,	1
but	1
to	1
that	1
ever-contracting,	1
dropping	1
circle	1
ashore,	1
who,	1
for	1
any	1
reason,	1
possessed	1
the	1
privilege	1
of	1
a	1
less	1
banned	1
approach	1
to	1
him;	1
to	1
that	1
timid	1
circle	1
the	1
above	1
hinted	1
casualty--remaining,	1
as	1
it	1
did,	1
moodily	1
unaccounted	1
for	1
by	1
Ahab--invested	1
itself	1
with	1
terrors,	1
not	1
entirely	1
underived	1
from	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
spirits	1
and	1
of	1
wails.	1
So	1
that,	1
through	1
their	1
zeal	1
for	1
him,	1
they	1
had	1
all	1
conspired,	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
in	1
them	1
lay,	1
to	1
muffle	1
up	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
this	1
thing	1
from	1
others;	1
and	1
hence	1
it	1
was,	1
that	1
not	1
till	1
a	1
considerable	1
interval	1
had	1
elapsed,	1
did	1
it	1
transpire	1
upon	1
the	1
Pequod's	1
decks.	1
But	1
be	1
all	1
this	1
as	1
it	1
may;	1
let	1
the	1
unseen,	1
ambiguous	1
synod	1
in	1
the	1
air,	1
or	1
the	1
vindictive	1
princes	1
and	1
potentates	1
of	1
fire,	1
have	1
to	1
do	1
or	1
not	1
with	1
earthly	1
Ahab,	1
yet,	1
in	1
this	1
present	1
matter	1
of	1
his	1
leg,	1
he	1
took	1
plain	1
practical	1
procedures;--he	1
called	1
the	1
carpenter.	1
And	1
when	1
that	1
functionary	1
appeared	1
before	1
him,	1
he	1
bade	1
him	1
without	1
delay	1
set	1
about	1
making	1
a	1
new	1
leg,	1
and	1
directed	1
the	1
mates	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
supplied	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
studs	1
and	1
joists	1
of	1
jaw-ivory	1
(Sperm	1
Whale)	1
which	1
had	1
thus	1
far	1
been	1
accumulated	1
on	1
the	1
voyage,	1
in	1
order	1
that	1
a	1
careful	1
selection	1
of	1
the	1
stoutest,	1
clearest-grained	1
stuff	1
might	1
be	1
secured.	1
This	1
done,	1
the	1
carpenter	1
received	1
orders	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
leg	1
completed	1
that	1
night;	1
and	1
to	1
provide	1
all	1
the	1
fittings	1
for	1
it,	1
independent	1
of	1
those	1
pertaining	1
to	1
the	1
distrusted	1
one	1
in	1
use.	1
Moreover,	1
the	1
ship's	1
forge	1
was	1
ordered	1
to	1
be	1
hoisted	1
out	1
of	1
its	1
temporary	1
idleness	1
in	1
the	1
hold;	1
and,	1
to	1
accelerate	1
the	1
affair,	1
the	1
blacksmith	1
was	1
commanded	1
to	1
proceed	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
the	1
forging	1
of	1
whatever	1
iron	1
contrivances	1
might	1
be	1
needed.	1
CHAPTER	1
107	1
The	1
Carpenter.	1
Seat	1
thyself	1
sultanically	1
among	1
the	1
moons	1
of	1
Saturn,	1
and	1
take	1
high	1
abstracted	1
man	1
alone;	1
and	1
he	1
seems	1
a	1
wonder,	1
a	1
grandeur,	1
and	1
a	1
woe.	1
But	1
from	1
the	1
same	1
point,	1
take	1
mankind	1
in	1
mass,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
part,	1
they	1
seem	1
a	1
mob	1
of	1
unnecessary	1
duplicates,	1
both	1
contemporary	1
and	1
hereditary.	1
But	1
most	1
humble	1
though	1
he	1
was,	1
and	1
far	1
from	1
furnishing	1
an	1
example	1
of	1
the	1
high,	1
humane	1
abstraction;	1
the	1
Pequod's	1
carpenter	1
was	1
no	1
duplicate;	1
hence,	1
he	1
now	1
comes	1
in	1
person	1
on	1
this	1
stage.	1
Like	1
all	1
sea-going	1
ship	1
carpenters,	1
and	1
more	1
especially	1
those	1
belonging	1
to	1
whaling	1
vessels,	1
he	1
was,	1
to	1
a	1
certain	1
off-handed,	1
practical	1
extent,	1
alike	1
experienced	1
in	1
numerous	1
trades	1
and	1
callings	1
collateral	1
to	1
his	1
own;	1
the	1
carpenter's	1
pursuit	1
being	1
the	1
ancient	1
and	1
outbranching	1
trunk	1
of	1
all	1
those	1
numerous	1
handicrafts	1
which	1
more	1
or	1
less	1
have	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
wood	1
as	1
an	1
auxiliary	1
material.	1
But,	1
besides	1
the	1
application	1
to	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
generic	1
remark	1
above,	1
this	1
carpenter	1
of	1
the	1
Pequod	1
was	1
singularly	1
efficient	1
in	1
those	1
thousand	1
nameless	1
mechanical	1
emergencies	1
continually	1
recurring	1
in	1
a	1
large	1
ship,	1
upon	1
a	1
three	1
or	1
four	1
years'	1
voyage,	1
in	1
uncivilized	1
and	1
far-distant	1
seas.	1
For	1
not	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
his	1
readiness	1
in	1
ordinary	1
duties:--repairing	1
stove	1
boats,	1
sprung	1
spars,	1
reforming	1
the	1
shape	1
of	1
clumsy-bladed	1
oars,	1
inserting	1
bull's	1
eyes	1
in	1
the	1
deck,	1
or	1
new	1
tree-nails	1
in	1
the	1
side	1
planks,	1
and	1
other	1
miscellaneous	1
matters	1
more	1
directly	1
pertaining	1
to	1
his	1
special	1
business;	1
he	1
was	1
moreover	1
unhesitatingly	1
expert	1
in	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
conflicting	1
aptitudes,	1
both	1
useful	1
and	1
capricious.	1
The	1
one	1
grand	1
stage	1
where	1
he	1
enacted	1
all	1
his	1
various	1
parts	1
so	1
manifold,	1
was	1
his	1
vice-bench;	1
a	1
long	1
rude	1
ponderous	1
table	1
furnished	1
with	1
several	1
vices,	1
of	1
different	1
sizes,	1
and	1
both	1
of	1
iron	1
and	1
of	1
wood.	1
At	1
all	1
times	1
except	1
when	1
whales	1
were	1
alongside,	1
this	1
bench	1
was	1
securely	1
lashed	1
athwartships	1
against	1
the	1
rear	1
of	1
the	1
Try-works.	1
A	1
belaying	1
pin	1
is	1
found	1
too	1
large	1
to	1
be	1
easily	1
inserted	1
into	1
its	1
hole:	1
the	1
carpenter	1
claps	1
it	1
into	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
ever-ready	1
vices,	1
and	1
straightway	1
files	1
it	1
smaller.	1
A	1
lost	1
land-bird	1
of	1
strange	1
plumage	1
strays	1
on	1
board,	1
and	1
is	1
made	1
a	1
captive:	1
out	1
of	1
clean	1
shaved	1
rods	1
of	1
right-whale	1
bone,	1
and	1
cross-beams	1
of	1
sperm	1
whale	1
ivory,	1
the	1
carpenter	1
makes	1
a	1
pagoda-looking	1
cage	1
for	1
it.	1
An	1
oarsman	1
sprains	1
his	1
wrist:	1
the	1
carpenter	1
concocts	1
a	1
soothing	1
lotion.	1
Stubb	1
longed	1
for	1
vermillion	1
stars	1
to	1
be	1
painted	1
upon	1
the	1
blade	1
of	1
his	1
every	1
oar;	1
screwing	1
each	1
oar	1
in	1
his	1
big	1
vice	1
of	1
wood,	1
the	1
carpenter	1
symmetrically	1
supplies	1
the	1
constellation.	1
A	1
sailor	1
takes	1
a	1
fancy	1
to	1
wear	1
shark-bone	1
ear-rings:	1
the	1
carpenter	1
drills	1
his	1
ears.	1
Another	1
has	1
the	1
toothache:	1
the	1
carpenter	1
out	1
pincers,	1
and	1
clapping	1
one	1
hand	1
upon	1
his	1
bench	1
bids	1
him	1
be	1
seated	1
there;	1
but	1
the	1
poor	1
fellow	1
unmanageably	1
winces	1
under	1
the	1
unconcluded	1
operation;	1
whirling	1
round	1
the	1
handle	1
of	1
his	1
wooden	1
vice,	1
the	1
carpenter	1
signs	1
him	1
to	1
clap	1
his	1
jaw	1
in	1
that,	1
if	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
him	1
draw	1
the	1
tooth.	1
Thus,	1
this	1
carpenter	1
was	1
prepared	1
at	1
all	1
points,	1
and	1
alike	1
indifferent	1
and	1
without	1
respect	1
in	1
all.	1
Teeth	1
he	1
accounted	1
bits	1
of	1
ivory;	1
heads	1
he	1
deemed	1
but	1
top-blocks;	1
men	1
themselves	1
he	1
lightly	1
held	1
for	1
capstans.	1
But	1
while	1
now	1
upon	1
so	1
wide	1
a	1
field	1
thus	1
variously	1
accomplished	1
and	1
with	1
such	1
liveliness	1
of	1
expertness	1
in	1
him,	1
too;	1
all	1
this	1
would	1
seem	1
to	1
argue	1
some	1
uncommon	1
vivacity	1
of	1
intelligence.	1
But	1
not	1
precisely	1
so.	1
For	1
nothing	1
was	1
this	1
man	1
more	1
remarkable,	1
than	1
for	1
a	1
certain	1
impersonal	1
stolidity	1
as	1
it	1
were;	1
impersonal,	1
I	1
say;	1
for	1
it	1
so	1
shaded	1
off	1
into	1
the	1
surrounding	1
infinite	1
of	1
things,	1
that	1
it	1
seemed	1
one	1
with	1
the	1
general	1
stolidity	1
discernible	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
visible	1
world;	1
which	1
while	1
pauselessly	1
active	1
in	1
uncounted	1
modes,	1
still	1
eternally	1
holds	1
its	1
peace,	1
and	1
ignores	1
you,	1
though	1
you	1
dig	1
foundations	1
for	1
cathedrals.	1
Yet	1
was	1
this	1
half-horrible	1
stolidity	1
in	1
him,	1
involving,	1
too,	1
as	1
it	1
appeared,	1
an	1
all-ramifying	1
heartlessness;--yet	1
was	1
it	1
oddly	1
dashed	1
at	1
times,	1
with	1
an	1
old,	1
crutch-like,	1
antediluvian,	1
wheezing	1
humorousness,	1
not	1
unstreaked	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
with	1
a	1
certain	1
grizzled	1
wittiness;	1
such	1
as	1
might	1
have	1
served	1
to	1
pass	1
the	1
time	1
during	1
the	1
midnight	1
watch	1
on	1
the	1
bearded	1
forecastle	1
of	1
Noah's	1
ark.	1
Was	1
it	1
that	1
this	1
old	1
carpenter	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
life-long	1
wanderer,	1
whose	1
much	1
rolling,	1
to	1
and	1
fro,	1
not	1
only	1
had	1
gathered	1
no	1
moss;	1
but	1
what	1
is	1
more,	1
had	1
rubbed	1
off	1
whatever	1
small	1
outward	1
clingings	1
might	1
have	1
originally	1
pertained	1
to	1
him?	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
stript	1
abstract;	1
an	1
unfractioned	1
integral;	1
uncompromised	1
as	1
a	1
new-born	1
babe;	1
living	1
without	1
premeditated	1
reference	1
to	1
this	1
world	1
or	1
the	1
next.	1
You	1
might	1
almost	1
say,	1
that	1
this	1
strange	1
uncompromisedness	1
in	1
him	1
involved	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
unintelligence;	1
for	1
in	1
his	1
numerous	1
trades,	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
work	1
so	1
much	1
by	1
reason	1
or	1
by	1
instinct,	1
or	1
simply	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
tutored	1
to	1
it,	1
or	1
by	1
any	1
intermixture	1
of	1
all	1
these,	1
even	1
or	1
uneven;	1
but	1
merely	1
by	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
deaf	1
and	1
dumb,	1
spontaneous	1
literal	1
process.	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
pure	1
manipulator;	1
his	1
brain,	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
ever	1
had	1
one,	1
must	1
have	1
early	1
oozed	1
along	1
into	1
the	1
muscles	1
of	1
his	1
fingers.	1
He	1
was	1
like	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
unreasoning	1
but	1
still	1
highly	1
useful,	1
MULTUM	1
IN	1
PARVO,	1
Sheffield	1
contrivances,	1
assuming	1
the	1
exterior--though	1
a	1
little	1
swelled--of	1
a	1
common	1
pocket	1
knife;	1
but	1
containing,	1
not	1
only	1
blades	1
of	1
various	1
sizes,	1
but	1
also	1
screw-drivers,	1
cork-screws,	1
tweezers,	1
awls,	1
pens,	1
rulers,	1
nail-filers,	1
countersinkers.	1
So,	1
if	1
his	1
superiors	1
wanted	1
to	1
use	1
the	1
carpenter	1
for	1
a	1
screw-driver,	1
all	1
they	1
had	1
to	1
do	1
was	1
to	1
open	1
that	1
part	1
of	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
screw	1
was	1
fast:	1
or	1
if	1
for	1
tweezers,	1
take	1
him	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
legs,	1
and	1
there	1
they	1
were.	1
Yet,	1
as	1
previously	1
hinted,	1
this	1
omnitooled,	1
open-and-shut	1
carpenter,	1
was,	1
after	1
all,	1
no	1
mere	1
machine	1
of	1
an	1
automaton.	1
If	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
have	1
a	1
common	1
soul	1
in	1
him,	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
subtle	1
something	1
that	1
somehow	1
anomalously	1
did	1
its	1
duty.	1
What	1
that	1
was,	1
whether	1
essence	1
of	1
quicksilver,	1
or	1
a	1
few	1
drops	1
of	1
hartshorn,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
telling.	1
But	1
there	1
it	1
was;	1
and	1
there	1
it	1
had	1
abided	1
for	1
now	1
some	1
sixty	1
years	1
or	1
more.	1
And	1
this	1
it	1
was,	1
this	1
same	1
unaccountable,	1
cunning	1
life-principle	1
in	1
him;	1
this	1
it	1
was,	1
that	1
kept	1
him	1
a	1
great	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
time	1
soliloquizing;	1
but	1
only	1
like	1
an	1
unreasoning	1
wheel,	1
which	1
also	1
hummingly	1
soliloquizes;	1
or	1
rather,	1
his	1
body	1
was	1
a	1
sentry-box	1
and	1
this	1
soliloquizer	1
on	1
guard	1
there,	1
and	1
talking	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
to	1
keep	1
himself	1
awake.	1

should	1

and	1
that	1

So	1
we	1
go,	1
who	1
file	1
old	1
jaws	1
and	1
shinbones.	1
Let's	1
try	1
another.	1
Aye,	1
now,	1
this	1
works	1
better	1
(SNEEZES).	1
Halloa,	1
this	1
bone	1
dust	1
is	1
(SNEEZES)--why	1
it's	1
(SNEEZES)--yes	1
it's	1
(SNEEZES)--bless	1
my	1
soul,	1
it	1
won't	1
let	1
me	1
speak!	1
This	1
is	1
what	1
an	1
old	1
fellow	1
gets	1
now	1
for	1
working	1
in	1
dead	1
lumber.	1
Saw	1
a	1
live	1
tree,	1
and	1
you	1
don't	1
get	1
this	1
dust;	1
amputate	1
a	1
live	1
bone,	1
and	1
you	1
don't	1
get	1
it	1
(SNEEZES).	1
Come,	1
come,	1
you	1
old	1
Smut,	1
there,	1
bear	1
a	1
hand,	1
and	1
let's	1
have	1
that	1
ferule	1
and	1
buckle-screw;	1
I'll	1
be	1
ready	1
for	1
them	1
presently.	1
Lucky	1
now	1
(SNEEZES)	1
there's	1
no	1
knee-joint	1
to	1
make;	1
that	1
might	1
puzzle	1
a	1
little;	1
but	1
a	1
mere	1
shinbone--why	1
it's	1
easy	1
as	1
making	1
hop-poles;	1
only	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
put	1
a	1
good	1
finish	1
on.	1
Time,	1
time;	1
if	1
I	1
but	1
only	1
had	1
the	1
time,	1
I	1
could	1
turn	1
him	1
out	1
as	1
neat	1
a	1
leg	1
now	1
as	1
ever	1
(SNEEZES)	1
scraped	1
to	1
a	1
lady	1
in	1
a	1
parlor.	1
Those	1
buckskin	1
legs	1
and	1
calves	1
of	1
legs	1
I've	1
seen	1
in	1
shop	1
windows	1
wouldn't	1
compare	1
at	1
all.	1
They	1
soak	1
water,	1
they	1
do;	1
and	1
of	1
course	1
get	1
rheumatic,	1
and	1
have	1
to	1
be	1
doctored	1
(SNEEZES)	1
with	1
washes	1
and	1
lotions,	1
just	1
like	1
live	1
legs.	1
There;	1
before	1
I	1
saw	1
it	1
off,	1
now,	1
I	1
must	1
call	1
his	1
old	1
Mogulship,	1
and	1
see	1
whether	1
the	1
length	1
will	1
be	1
all	1
right;	1
too	1
short,	1
if	1
anything,	1
I	1
guess.	1
Ha!	1
that's	1
the	1
heel;	1
we	1
are	1
in	1
luck;	1
here	1
he	1
comes,	1
or	1
it's	1
somebody	1
else,	1
that's	1
certain.	1

it's	1
not	1
the	1
first	1
time.	1
About	1
it!	1
There;	1
keep	1
thy	1
finger	1
on	1
it.	1
This	1
is	1
a	1
cogent	1
vice	1
thou	1
hast	1
here,	1
carpenter;	1
let	1
me	1
feel	1
its	1
grip	1
once.	1
So,	1
so;	1
it	1
does	1
pinch	1
some.	1
Oh,	1
sir,	1
it	1
will	1
break	1
bones--beware,	1
beware!	1
No	1
fear;	1
I	1
like	1
a	1
good	1
grip;	1
I	1
like	1
to	1
feel	1
something	1
in	1
this	1
slippery	1
world	1
that	1
can	1
hold,	1
man.	1
What's	1
Prometheus	1
about	1
there?--the	1
blacksmith,	1
I	1
mean--what's	1
he	1
about?	1
He	1
must	1
be	1
forging	1
the	1
buckle-screw,	1
sir,	1
now.	1
Right.	1
It's	1
a	1
partnership;	1
he	1
supplies	1
the	1
muscle	1
part.	1
He	1
makes	1
a	1
fierce	1
red	1
flame	1
there!	1
Aye,	1
sir;	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
the	1
white	1
heat	1
for	1
this	1
kind	1
of	1
fine	1
work.	1
Um-m.	1
So	1
he	1
must.	1
I	1
do	1
deem	1
it	1
now	1
a	1
most	1
meaning	1
thing,	1
that	1
that	1
old	1
Greek,	1
Prometheus,	1
who	1
made	1
men,	1
they	1
say,	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
blacksmith,	1
and	1
animated	1
them	1
with	1
fire;	1
for	1
what's	1
made	1
in	1
fire	1
must	1
properly	1
belong	1
to	1
fire;	1
and	1
so	1
hell's	1
probable.	1
How	1
the	1
soot	1
flies!	1
This	1
must	1
be	1
the	1
remainder	1
the	1
Greek	1
made	1
the	1
Africans	1
of.	1
Carpenter,	1
when	1
he's	1
through	1
with	1
that	1
buckle,	1
tell	1
him	1
to	1
forge	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
steel	1
shoulder-blades;	1
there's	1
a	1
pedlar	1
aboard	1
with	1
a	1
crushing	1
pack.	1
Sir?	1
Hold;	1
while	1
Prometheus	1
is	1
about	1
it,	1
I'll	1
order	1
a	1
complete	1
man	1
after	1
a	1
desirable	1
pattern.	1
Imprimis,	1
fifty	1
feet	1
high	1
in	1
his	1
socks;	1
then,	1
chest	1
modelled	1
after	1
the	1
Thames	1
Tunnel;	1
then,	1
legs	1
with	1
roots	1
to	1
'em,	1
to	1
stay	1
in	1
one	1
place;	1
then,	1
arms	1
three	1
feet	1
through	1
the	1
wrist;	1
no	1
heart	1
at	1
all,	1
brass	1
forehead,	1
and	1
about	1
a	1
quarter	1
of	1
an	1
acre	1
of	1
fine	1
brains;	1
and	1
let	1
me	1
see--shall	1
I	1
order	1
eyes	1
to	1
see	1
outwards?	1
No,	1
but	1
put	1
a	1
sky-light	1
on	1
top	1
of	1
his	1
head	1
to	1
illuminate	1
inwards.	1
There,	1
take	1
the	1
order,	1
and	1
away.	1
Now,	1
what's	1
he	1
speaking	1
about,	1
and	1
who's	1
he	1
speaking	1
to,	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
know?	1
Shall	1
I	1
keep	1
standing	1
here?	1
(ASIDE).	1
'Tis	1
but	1
indifferent	1
architecture	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
blind	1
dome;	1
here's	1
one.	1
No,	1
no,	1
no;	1
I	1
must	1
have	1
a	1
lantern.	1
Ho,	1
ho!	1
That's	1
it,	1
hey?	1
Here	1
are	1
two,	1
sir;	1
one	1
will	1
serve	1
my	1
turn.	1
What	1
art	1
thou	1
thrusting	1
that	1
thief-catcher	1
into	1
my	1
face	1
for,	1
man?	1
Thrusted	1
light	1
is	1
worse	1
than	1
presented	1
pistols.	1
I	1
thought,	1
sir,	1
that	1
you	1
spoke	1
to	1
carpenter.	1
Carpenter?	1
why	1
that's--but	1
no;--a	1
very	1
tidy,	1
and,	1
I	1
may	1
say,	1
an	1
extremely	1
gentlemanlike	1
sort	1
of	1
business	1
thou	1
art	1
in	1
here,	1
carpenter;--or	1
would'st	1
thou	1
rather	1
work	1
in	1
clay?	1
Sir?--Clay?	1
clay,	1
sir?	1
That's	1
mud;	1
we	1
leave	1
clay	1
to	1
ditchers,	1
sir.	1
The	1
fellow's	1
impious!	1
What	1
art	1
thou	1
sneezing	1
about?	1
Bone	1
is	1
rather	1
dusty,	1
sir.	1
Take	1
the	1
hint,	1
then;	1
and	1
when	1
thou	1
art	1
dead,	1
never	1
bury	1
thyself	1
under	1
living	1
people's	1
noses.	1
Sir?--oh!	1
ah!--I	1
guess	1
so;--yes--dear!	1
Look	1
ye,	1
carpenter,	1
I	1
dare	1
say	1
thou	1
callest	1
thyself	1
a	1
right	1
good	1
workmanlike	1
workman,	1
eh?	1
Well,	1
then,	1
will	1
it	1
speak	1
thoroughly	1
well	1
for	1
thy	1
work,	1
if,	1
when	1
I	1
come	1
to	1
mount	1
this	1
leg	1
thou	1
makest,	1
I	1
shall	1
nevertheless	1
feel	1
another	1
leg	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
identical	1
place	1
with	1
it;	1
that	1
is,	1
carpenter,	1
my	1
old	1
lost	1
leg;	1
the	1
flesh	1
and	1
blood	1
one,	1
I	1
mean.	1
Canst	1
thou	1
not	1
drive	1
that	1
old	1
Adam	1
away?	1
Truly,	1
sir,	1
I	1
begin	1
to	1
understand	1
somewhat	1
now.	1
Yes,	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
something	1
curious	1
on	1
that	1
score,	1
sir;	1
how	1
that	1
a	1
dismasted	1
man	1
never	1
entirely	1
loses	1
the	1
feeling	1
of	1
his	1
old	1
spar,	1
but	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
still	1
pricking	1
him	1
at	1
times.	1
May	1
I	1
humbly	1
ask	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
really	1
so,	1
sir?	1
It	1
is,	1
man.	1
Look,	1
put	1
thy	1
live	1
leg	1
here	1
in	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
mine	1
once	1
was;	1
so,	1
now,	1
here	1
is	1
only	1
one	1
distinct	1
leg	1
to	1
the	1
eye,	1
yet	1
two	1
to	1
the	1
soul.	1
Where	1
thou	1
feelest	1
tingling	1
life;	1
there,	1
exactly	1
there,	1
there	1
to	1
a	1
hair,	1
do	1
I.	1
Is't	1
a	1
riddle?	1
I	1
should	1
humbly	1
call	1
it	1
a	1
poser,	1
sir.	1
Hist,	1
then.	1
How	1
dost	1
thou	1
know	1
that	1
some	1
entire,	1
living,	1
thinking	1
thing	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
invisibly	1
and	1
uninterpenetratingly	1
standing	1
precisely	1
where	1
thou	1
now	1
standest;	1
aye,	1
and	1
standing	1
there	1
in	1
thy	1
spite?	1
In	1
thy	1
most	1
solitary	1
hours,	1
then,	1
dost	1
thou	1
not	1
fear	1
eavesdroppers?	1
Hold,	1
don't	1
speak!	1
And	1
if	1
I	1
still	1
feel	1
the	1
smart	1
of	1
my	1
crushed	1
leg,	1
though	1
it	1
be	1
now	1
so	1
long	1
dissolved;	1
then,	1
why	1
mayst	1
not	1
thou,	1
carpenter,	1
feel	1
the	1
fiery	1
pains	1
of	1
hell	1
for	1
ever,	1
and	1
without	1
a	1
body?	1
Hah!	1
Good	1
Lord!	1
Truly,	1
sir,	1
if	1
it	1
comes	1
to	1
that,	1
I	1
must	1
calculate	1
over	1
again;	1
I	1
think	1
I	1
didn't	1
carry	1
a	1
small	1
figure,	1
sir.	1
Look	1
ye,	1
pudding-heads	1
should	1
never	1
grant	1
premises.--How	1
long	1
before	1
the	1
leg	1
is	1
done?	1
Perhaps	1
an	1
hour,	1
sir.	1
Bungle	1
away	1
at	1
it	1
then,	1
and	1
bring	1
it	1
to	1
me	1
(TURNS	1
TO	1
GO).	1
Oh,	1
Life!	1
Here	1
I	1
am,	1
proud	1
as	1
Greek	1
god,	1
and	1
yet	1
standing	1
debtor	1
to	1
this	1
blockhead	1
for	1
a	1
bone	1
to	1
stand	1
on!	1
Cursed	1
be	1
that	1
mortal	1
inter-indebtedness	1
which	1
will	1
not	1
do	1
away	1
with	1
ledgers.	1
I	1
would	1
be	1
free	1
as	1
air;	1
and	1
I'm	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
world's	1
books.	1
I	1
am	1
so	1
rich,	1
I	1
could	1
have	1
given	1
bid	1
for	1
bid	1
with	1
the	1
wealthiest	1
Praetorians	1
at	1
the	1
auction	1
of	1
the	1
Roman	1
empire	1
(which	1
was	1
the	1
world's);	1
and	1
yet	1
I	1
owe	1
for	1
the	1
flesh	1
in	1
the	1
tongue	1
I	1
brag	1
with.	1
By	1
heavens!	1
I'll	1
get	1
a	1
crucible,	1
and	1
into	1
it,	1
and	1
dissolve	1
myself	1
down	1
to	1
one	1
small,	1
compendious	1
vertebra.	1
So.	1
CARPENTER	1
(RESUMING	1
HIS	1
WORK).	1
Well,	1
well,	1
well!	1
Stubb	1
knows	1
him	1
best	1
of	1
all,	1
and	1
Stubb	1
always	1
says	1
he's	1
queer;	1
says	1
nothing	1
but	1
that	1
one	1
sufficient	1
little	1
word	1
queer;	1
he's	1
queer,	1
says	1
Stubb;	1
he's	1
queer--queer,	1
queer;	1
and	1
keeps	1
dinning	1
it	1
into	1
Mr.	1
Starbuck	1
all	1
the	1
time--queer--sir--queer,	1
queer,	1
very	1
queer.	1
And	1
here's	1
his	1
leg!	1
Yes,	1
now	1
that	1
I	1
think	1
of	1
it,	1
here's	1
his	1
bedfellow!	1
has	1
a	1
stick	1
of	1
whale's	1
jaw-bone	1
for	1
a	1
wife!	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
his	1
leg;	1
he'll	1
stand	1
on	1
this.	1
What	1
was	1
that	1
now	1
about	1
one	1
leg	1
standing	1
in	1
three	1
places,	1
and	1
all	1
three	1
places	1
standing	1
in	1
one	1
hell--how	1
was	1
that?	1
Oh!	1
I	1
don't	1
wonder	1
he	1
looked	1
so	1
scornful	1
at	1
me!	1
I'm	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
strange-thoughted	1
sometimes,	1
they	1
say;	1
but	1
that's	1
only	1
haphazard-like.	1
Then,	1
a	1
short,	1
little	1
old	1
body	1
like	1
me,	1
should	1
never	1
undertake	1
to	1
wade	1
out	1
into	1
deep	1
waters	1
with	1
tall,	1
heron-built	1
captains;	1
the	1
water	1
chucks	1
you	1
under	1
the	1
chin	1
pretty	1
quick,	1
and	1
there's	1
a	1
great	1
cry	1
for	1
life-boats.	1
And	1
here's	1
the	1
heron's	1
leg!	1
long	1
and	1
slim,	1
sure	1
enough!	1
Now,	1
for	1
most	1
folks	1
one	1
pair	1
of	1
legs	1
lasts	1
a	1
lifetime,	1
and	1
that	1
must	1
be	1
because	1
they	1
use	1
them	1
mercifully,	1
as	1
a	1
tender-hearted	1
old	1
lady	1
uses	1
her	1
roly-poly	1
old	1
coach-horses.	1
But	1
Ahab;	1
oh	1
he's	1
a	1
hard	1
driver.	1
Look,	1
driven	1
one	1
leg	1
to	1
death,	1
and	1
spavined	1
the	1
other	1
for	1
life,	1
and	1
now	1
wears	1
out	1
bone	1
legs	1
by	1
the	1
cord.	1
Halloa,	1
there,	1
you	1
Smut!	1
bear	1
a	1
hand	1
there	1
with	1
those	1
screws,	1
and	1
let's	1
finish	1
it	1
before	1
the	1
resurrection	1
fellow	1
comes	1
a-calling	1
with	1
his	1
horn	1
for	1
all	1
legs,	1
true	1
or	1
false,	1
as	1
brewery-men	1
go	1
round	1
collecting	1
old	1
beer	1
barrels,	1
to	1
fill	1
'em	1
up	1
again.	1
What	1
a	1
leg	1
this	1
is!	1
It	1
looks	1
like	1
a	1
real	1
live	1
leg,	1
filed	1
down	1
to	1
nothing	1
but	1
the	1
core;	1
he'll	1
be	1
standing	1
on	1
this	1
to-morrow;	1
he'll	1
be	1
taking	1
altitudes	1
on	1
it.	1
Halloa!	1
I	1
almost	1
forgot	1
the	1
little	1
oval	1
slate,	1
smoothed	1
ivory,	1
where	1
he	1
figures	1
up	1
the	1
latitude.	1
So,	1
so;	1
chisel,	1
file,	1
and	1
sand-paper,	1
now!	1
CHAPTER	1
109	1
Ahab	1
and	1
Starbuck	1
in	1
the	1
Cabin.	1
According	1
to	1
usage	1
they	1
were	1
pumping	1
the	1
ship	1
next	1
morning;	1
and	1
lo!	1
no	1
inconsiderable	1
oil	1
came	1
up	1
with	1
the	1
water;	1
the	1
casks	1
below	1
must	1
have	1
sprung	1
a	1
bad	1
leak.	1
Much	1
concern	1
was	1
shown;	1
and	1
Starbuck	1
went	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
cabin	1
to	1
report	1
this	1
unfavourable	1
affair.*	1
*In	1
Sperm-whalemen	1
with	1
any	1
considerable	1
quantity	1
of	1
oil	1
on	1
board,	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
regular	1
semiweekly	1
duty	1
to	1
conduct	1
a	1
hose	1
into	1
the	1
hold,	1
and	1
drench	1
the	1
casks	1
with	1
sea-water;	1
which	1
afterwards,	1
at	1
varying	1
intervals,	1
is	1
removed	1
by	1
the	1
ship's	1
pumps.	1
Hereby	1
the	1
casks	1
are	1
sought	1
to	1
be	1
kept	1
damply	1
tight;	1
while	1
by	1
the	1
changed	1
character	1
of	1
the	1
withdrawn	1
water,	1
the	1
mariners	1
readily	1
detect	1
any	1
serious	1
leakage	1
in	1
the	1
precious	1
cargo.	1
Now,	1
from	1
the	1
South	1
and	1
West	1
the	1
Pequod	1
was	1
drawing	1
nigh	1
to	1
Formosa	1
and	1
the	1
Bashee	1
Isles,	1
between	1
which	1
lies	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
tropical	1
outlets	1
from	1
the	1
China	1
waters	1
into	1
the	1
Pacific.	1
And	1
so	1
Starbuck	1
found	1
Ahab	1
with	1
a	1
general	1
chart	1
of	1
the	1
oriental	1
archipelagoes	1
spread	1
before	1
him;	1
and	1
another	1
separate	1
one	1
representing	1
the	1
long	1
eastern	1
coasts	1
of	1
the	1
Japanese	1
islands--Niphon,	1
Matsmai,	1
and	1
Sikoke.	1
With	1
his	1
snow-white	1
new	1
ivory	1
leg	1
braced	1
against	1
the	1
screwed	1
leg	1
of	1
his	1
table,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
long	1
pruning-hook	1
of	1
a	1
jack-knife	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
the	1
wondrous	1
old	1
man,	1
with	1
his	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
gangway	1
door,	1
was	1
wrinkling	1
his	1
brow,	1
and	1
tracing	1
his	1
old	1
courses	1
again.	1
"Who's	1
there?"	1
hearing	1
the	1
footstep	1
at	1
the	1
door,	1
but	1
not	1
turning	1
round	1
to	1
it.	1
"On	1
deck!	1
Begone!"	1
"Captain	1
Ahab	1
mistakes;	1
it	1
is	1
I.	1
The	1
oil	1
in	1
the	1
hold	1
is	1
leaking,	1
sir.	1
We	1
must	1
up	1
Burtons	1
and	1
break	1
out."	1
"Up	1
Burtons	1
and	1
break	1
out?	1
Now	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
nearing	1
Japan;	1
heave-to	1
here	1
for	1
a	1
week	1
to	1
tinker	1
a	1
parcel	1
of	1
old	1
hoops?"	1
"Either	1
do	1
that,	1
sir,	1
or	1
waste	1
in	1
one	1
day	1
more	1
oil	1
than	1
we	1
may	1
make	1
good	1
in	1
a	1
year.	1
What	1
we	1
come	1
twenty	1
thousand	1
miles	1
to	1
get	1
is	1
worth	1
saving,	1
sir."	1
"So	1
it	1
is,	1
so	1
it	1
is;	1
if	1
we	1
get	1
it."	1
"I	1
was	1
speaking	1
of	1
the	1
oil	1
in	1
the	1
hold,	1
sir."	1
"And	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
speaking	1
or	1
thinking	1
of	1
that	1
at	1
all.	1
Begone!	1
Let	1
it	1
leak!	1
I'm	1
all	1
aleak	1
myself.	1
Aye!	1
leaks	1
in	1
leaks!	1
not	1
only	1
full	1
of	1
leaky	1
casks,	1
but	1
those	1
leaky	1
casks	1
are	1
in	1
a	1
leaky	1
ship;	1
and	1
that's	1
a	1
far	1
worse	1
plight	1
than	1
the	1
Pequod's,	1
man.	1
Yet	1
I	1
don't	1
stop	1
to	1
plug	1
my	1
leak;	1
for	1
who	1
can	1
find	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
deep-loaded	1
hull;	1
or	1
how	1
hope	1
to	1
plug	1
it,	1
even	1
if	1
found,	1
in	1
this	1
life's	1
howling	1
gale?	1
Starbuck!	1
I'll	1
not	1
have	1
the	1
Burtons	1
hoisted."	1
"What	1
will	1
the	1
owners	1
say,	1
sir?"	1
"Let	1
the	1
owners	1
stand	1
on	1
Nantucket	1
beach	1
and	1
outyell	1
the	1
Typhoons.	1
What	1
cares	1
Ahab?	1
Owners,	1
owners?	1
Thou	1
art	1
always	1
prating	1
to	1
me,	1
Starbuck,	1
about	1
those	1
miserly	1
owners,	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
owners	1
were	1
my	1
conscience.	1
But	1
look	1
ye,	1
the	1
only	1
real	1
owner	1
of	1
anything	1
is	1
its	1
commander;	1
and	1
hark	1
ye,	1
my	1
conscience	1
is	1
in	1
this	1
ship's	1
keel.--On	1
deck!"	1
"Captain	1
Ahab,"	1
said	1
the	1
reddening	1
mate,	1
moving	1
further	1
into	1
the	1
cabin,	1
with	1
a	1
daring	1
so	1
strangely	1
respectful	1
and	1
cautious	1
that	1
it	1
almost	1
seemed	1
not	1
only	1
every	1
way	1
seeking	1
to	1
avoid	1
the	1
slightest	1
outward	1
manifestation	1
of	1
itself,	1
but	1
within	1
also	1
seemed	1
more	1
than	1
half	1
distrustful	1
of	1
itself;	1
"A	1
better	1
man	1
than	1
I	1
might	1
well	1
pass	1
over	1
in	1
thee	1
what	1
he	1
would	1
quickly	1
enough	1
resent	1
in	1
a	1
younger	1
man;	1
aye,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
happier,	1
Captain	1
Ahab."	1
"Devils!	1
Dost	1
thou	1
then	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
dare	1
to	1
critically	1
think	1
of	1
me?--On	1
deck!"	1
"Nay,	1
sir,	1
not	1
yet;	1
I	1
do	1
entreat.	1
And	1
I	1
do	1
dare,	1
sir--to	1
be	1
forbearing!	1
Shall	1
we	1
not	1
understand	1
each	1
other	1
better	1
than	1
hitherto,	1
Captain	1
Ahab?"	1
Ahab	1
seized	1
a	1
loaded	1
musket	1
from	1
the	1
rack	1
(forming	1
part	1
of	1
most	1
South-Sea-men's	1
cabin	1
furniture),	1
and	1
pointing	1
it	1
towards	1
Starbuck,	1
exclaimed:	1
"There	1
is	1
one	1
God	1
that	1
is	1
Lord	1
over	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
one	1
Captain	1
that	1
is	1
lord	1
over	1
the	1
Pequod.--On	1
deck!"	1
For	1
an	1
instant	1
in	1
the	1
flashing	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
mate,	1
and	1
his	1
fiery	1
cheeks,	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
almost	1
thought	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
really	1
received	1
the	1
blaze	1
of	1
the	1
levelled	1
tube.	1
But,	1
mastering	1
his	1
emotion,	1
he	1
half	1
calmly	1
rose,	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
quitted	1
the	1
cabin,	1
paused	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
and	1
said:	1
"Thou	1
hast	1
outraged,	1
not	1
insulted	1
me,	1
sir;	1
but	1
for	1
that	1
I	1
ask	1
thee	1
not	1
to	1
beware	1
of	1
Starbuck;	1
thou	1
wouldst	1
but	1
laugh;	1
but	1
let	1
Ahab	1
beware	1
of	1
Ahab;	1
beware	1
of	1
thyself,	1
old	1
man."	1
"He	1
waxes	1
brave,	1
but	1
nevertheless	1
obeys;	1
most	1
careful	1
bravery	1
that!"	1
murmured	1
Ahab,	1
as	1
Starbuck	1
disappeared.	1
"What's	1
that	1
he	1
said--Ahab	1
beware	1
of	1
Ahab--there's	1
something	1
there!"	1
Then	1
unconsciously	1
using	1
the	1
musket	1
for	1
a	1
staff,	1
with	1
an	1
iron	1
brow	1
he	1
paced	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
in	1
the	1
little	1
cabin;	1
but	1
presently	1
the	1
thick	1
plaits	1
of	1
his	1
forehead	1
relaxed,	1
and	1
returning	1
the	1
gun	1
to	1
the	1
rack,	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
deck.	1
"Thou	1
art	1
but	1
too	1
good	1
a	1
fellow,	1
Starbuck,"	1
he	1
said	1
lowly	1
to	1
the	1
mate;	1
then	1
raising	1
his	1
voice	1
to	1
the	1
crew:	1
"Furl	1
the	1
t'gallant-sails,	1
and	1
close-reef	1
the	1
top-sails,	1
fore	1
and	1
aft;	1
back	1
the	1
main-yard;	1
up	1
Burton,	1
and	1
break	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
main-hold."	1
It	1
were	1
perhaps	1
vain	1
to	1
surmise	1
exactly	1
why	1
it	1
was,	1
that	1
as	1
respecting	1
Starbuck,	1
Ahab	1
thus	1
acted.	1
It	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
flash	1
of	1
honesty	1
in	1
him;	1
or	1
mere	1
prudential	1
policy	1
which,	1
under	1
the	1
circumstance,	1
imperiously	1
forbade	1
the	1
slightest	1
symptom	1
of	1
open	1
disaffection,	1
however	1
transient,	1
in	1
the	1
important	1
chief	1
officer	1
of	1
his	1
ship.	1
However	1
it	1
was,	1
his	1
orders	1
were	1
executed;	1
and	1
the	1
Burtons	1
were	1
hoisted.	1
CHAPTER	1
110	1
Queequeg	1
in	1
His	1
Coffin.	1
Upon	1
searching,	1
it	1
was	1
found	1
that	1
the	1
casks	1
last	1
struck	1
into	1
the	1
hold	1
were	1
perfectly	1
sound,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
leak	1
must	1
be	1
further	1
off.	1
So,	1
it	1
being	1
calm	1
weather,	1
they	1
broke	1
out	1
deeper	1
and	1
deeper,	1
disturbing	1
the	1
slumbers	1
of	1
the	1
huge	1
ground-tier	1
butts;	1
and	1
from	1
that	1
black	1
midnight	1
sending	1
those	1
gigantic	1
moles	1
into	1
the	1
daylight	1
above.	1
So	1
deep	1
did	1
they	1
go;	1
and	1
so	1
ancient,	1
and	1
corroded,	1
and	1
weedy	1
the	1
aspect	1
of	1
the	1
lowermost	1
puncheons,	1
that	1
you	1
almost	1
looked	1
next	1
for	1
some	1
mouldy	1
corner-stone	1
cask	1
containing	1
coins	1
of	1
Captain	1
Noah,	1
with	1
copies	1
of	1
the	1
posted	1
placards,	1
vainly	1
warning	1
the	1
infatuated	1
old	1
world	1
from	1
the	1
flood.	1
Tierce	1
after	1
tierce,	1
too,	1
of	1
water,	1
and	1
bread,	1
and	1
beef,	1
and	1
shooks	1
of	1
staves,	1
and	1
iron	1
bundles	1
of	1
hoops,	1
were	1
hoisted	1
out,	1
till	1
at	1
last	1
the	1
piled	1
decks	1
were	1
hard	1
to	1
get	1
about;	1
and	1
the	1
hollow	1
hull	1
echoed	1
under	1
foot,	1
as	1
if	1
you	1
were	1
treading	1
over	1
empty	1
catacombs,	1
and	1
reeled	1
and	1
rolled	1
in	1
the	1
sea	1
like	1
an	1
air-freighted	1
demijohn.	1
Top-heavy	1
was	1
the	1
ship	1
as	1
a	1
dinnerless	1
student	1
with	1
all	1
Aristotle	1
in	1
his	1
head.	1
Well	1
was	1
it	1
that	1
the	1
Typhoons	1
did	1
not	1
visit	1
them	1
then.	1
Now,	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
my	1
poor	1
pagan	1
companion,	1
and	1
fast	1
bosom-friend,	1
Queequeg,	1
was	1
seized	1
with	1
a	1
fever,	1
which	1
brought	1
him	1
nigh	1
to	1
his	1
endless	1
end.	1
Be	1
it	1
said,	1
that	1
in	1
this	1
vocation	1
of	1
whaling,	1
sinecures	1
are	1
unknown;	1
dignity	1
and	1
danger	1
go	1
hand	1
in	1
hand;	1
till	1
you	1
get	1
to	1
be	1
Captain,	1
the	1
higher	1
you	1
rise	1
the	1
harder	1
you	1
toil.	1
So	1
with	1
poor	1
Queequeg,	1
who,	1
as	1
harpooneer,	1
must	1
not	1
only	1
face	1
all	1
the	1
rage	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
whale,	1
but--as	1
we	1
have	1
elsewhere	1
seen--mount	1
his	1
dead	1
back	1
in	1
a	1
rolling	1
sea;	1
and	1
finally	1
descend	1
into	1
the	1
gloom	1
of	1
the	1
hold,	1
and	1
bitterly	1
sweating	1
all	1
day	1
in	1
that	1
subterraneous	1
confinement,	1
resolutely	1
manhandle	1
the	1
clumsiest	1
casks	1
and	1
see	1
to	1
their	1
stowage.	1
To	1
be	1
short,	1
among	1
whalemen,	1
the	1
harpooneers	1
are	1
the	1
holders,	1
so	1
called.	1
Poor	1
Queequeg!	1
when	1
the	1
ship	1
was	1
about	1
half	1
disembowelled,	1
you	1
should	1
have	1
stooped	1
over	1
the	1
hatchway,	1
and	1
peered	1
down	1
upon	1
him	1
there;	1
where,	1
stripped	1
to	1
his	1
woollen	1
drawers,	1
the	1
tattooed	1
savage	1
was	1
crawling	1
about	1
amid	1
that	1
dampness	1
and	1
slime,	1
like	1
a	1
green	1
spotted	1
lizard	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
a	1
well.	1
And	1
a	1
well,	1
or	1
an	1
ice-house,	1
it	1
somehow	1
proved	1
to	1
him,	1
poor	1
pagan;	1
where,	1
strange	1
to	1
say,	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
heat	1
of	1
his	1
sweatings,	1
he	1
caught	1
a	1
terrible	1
chill	1
which	1
lapsed	1
into	1
a	1
fever;	1
and	1
at	1
last,	1
after	1
some	1
days'	1
suffering,	1
laid	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
hammock,	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
very	1
sill	1
of	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
death.	1
How	1
he	1
wasted	1
and	1
wasted	1
away	1
in	1
those	1
few	1
long-lingering	1
days,	1
till	1
there	1
seemed	1
but	1
little	1
left	1
of	1
him	1
but	1
his	1
frame	1
and	1
tattooing.	1
But	1
as	1
all	1
else	1
in	1
him	1
thinned,	1
and	1
his	1
cheek-bones	1
grew	1
sharper,	1
his	1
eyes,	1
nevertheless,	1
seemed	1
growing	1
fuller	1
and	1
fuller;	1
they	1
became	1
of	1
a	1
strange	1
softness	1
of	1
lustre;	1
and	1
mildly	1
but	1
deeply	1
looked	1
out	1
at	1
you	1
there	1
from	1
his	1
sickness,	1
a	1
wondrous	1
testimony	1
to	1
that	1
immortal	1
health	1
in	1
him	1
which	1
could	1
not	1
die,	1
or	1
be	1
weakened.	1
And	1
like	1
circles	1
on	1
the	1
water,	1
which,	1
as	1
they	1
grow	1
fainter,	1
expand;	1
so	1
his	1
eyes	1
seemed	1
rounding	1
and	1
rounding,	1
like	1
the	1
rings	1
of	1
Eternity.	1
An	1
awe	1
that	1
cannot	1
be	1
named	1
would	1
steal	1
over	1
you	1
as	1
you	1
sat	1
by	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
this	1
waning	1
savage,	1
and	1
saw	1
as	1
strange	1
things	1
in	1
his	1
face,	1
as	1
any	1
beheld	1
who	1
were	1
bystanders	1
when	1
Zoroaster	1
died.	1
For	1
whatever	1
is	1
truly	1
wondrous	1
and	1
fearful	1
in	1
man,	1
never	1
yet	1
was	1
put	1
into	1
words	1
or	1
books.	1
And	1
the	1
drawing	1
near	1
of	1
Death,	1
which	1
alike	1
levels	1
all,	1
alike	1
impresses	1
all	1
with	1
a	1
last	1
revelation,	1
which	1
only	1
an	1
author	1
from	1
the	1
dead	1
could	1
adequately	1
tell.	1
So	1
that--let	1
us	1
say	1
it	1
again--no	1
dying	1
Chaldee	1
or	1
Greek	1
had	1
higher	1
and	1
holier	1
thoughts	1
than	1
those,	1
whose	1
mysterious	1
shades	1
you	1
saw	1
creeping	1
over	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
poor	1
Queequeg,	1
as	1
he	1
quietly	1
lay	1
in	1
his	1
swaying	1
hammock,	1
and	1
the	1
rolling	1
sea	1
seemed	1
gently	1
rocking	1
him	1
to	1
his	1
final	1
rest,	1
and	1
the	1
ocean's	1
invisible	1
flood-tide	1
lifted	1
him	1
higher	1
and	1
higher	1
towards	1
his	1
destined	1
heaven.	1
Not	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
crew	1
but	1
gave	1
him	1
up;	1
and,	1
as	1
for	1
Queequeg	1
himself,	1
what	1
he	1
thought	1
of	1
his	1
case	1
was	1
forcibly	1
shown	1
by	1
a	1
curious	1
favour	1
he	1
asked.	1
He	1
called	1
one	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
grey	1
morning	1
watch,	1
when	1
the	1
day	1
was	1
just	1
breaking,	1
and	1
taking	1
his	1
hand,	1
said	1
that	1
while	1
in	1
Nantucket	1
he	1
had	1
chanced	1
to	1
see	1
certain	1
little	1
canoes	1
of	1
dark	1
wood,	1
like	1
the	1
rich	1
war-wood	1
of	1
his	1
native	1
isle;	1
and	1
upon	1
inquiry,	1
he	1
had	1
learned	1
that	1
all	1
whalemen	1
who	1
died	1
in	1
Nantucket,	1
were	1
laid	1
in	1
those	1
same	1
dark	1
canoes,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
fancy	1
of	1
being	1
so	1
laid	1
had	1
much	1
pleased	1
him;	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
unlike	1
the	1
custom	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
race,	1
who,	1
after	1
embalming	1
a	1
dead	1
warrior,	1
stretched	1
him	1
out	1
in	1
his	1
canoe,	1
and	1
so	1
left	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
floated	1
away	1
to	1
the	1
starry	1
archipelagoes;	1
for	1
not	1
only	1
do	1
they	1
believe	1
that	1
the	1
stars	1
are	1
isles,	1
but	1
that	1
far	1
beyond	1
all	1
visible	1
horizons,	1
their	1
own	1
mild,	1
uncontinented	1
seas,	1
interflow	1
with	1
the	1
blue	1
heavens;	1
and	1
so	1
form	1
the	1
white	1
breakers	1
of	1
the	1
milky	1
way.	1
He	1
added,	1
that	1
he	1
shuddered	1
at	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
being	1
buried	1
in	1
his	1
hammock,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
usual	1
sea-custom,	1
tossed	1
like	1
something	1
vile	1
to	1
the	1
death-devouring	1
sharks.	1
No:	1
he	1
desired	1
a	1
canoe	1
like	1
those	1
of	1
Nantucket,	1
all	1
the	1
more	1
congenial	1
to	1
him,	1
being	1
a	1
whaleman,	1
that	1
like	1
a	1
whale-boat	1
these	1
coffin-canoes	1
were	1
without	1
a	1
keel;	1
though	1
that	1
involved	1
but	1
uncertain	1
steering,	1
and	1
much	1
lee-way	1
adown	1
the	1
dim	1
ages.	1
Now,	1
when	1
this	1
strange	1
circumstance	1
was	1
made	1
known	1
aft,	1
the	1
carpenter	1
was	1
at	1
once	1
commanded	1
to	1
do	1
Queequeg's	1
bidding,	1
whatever	1
it	1
might	1
include.	1
There	1
was	1
some	1
heathenish,	1
coffin-coloured	1
old	1
lumber	1
aboard,	1
which,	1
upon	1
a	1
long	1
previous	1
voyage,	1
had	1
been	1
cut	1
from	1
the	1
aboriginal	1
groves	1
of	1
the	1
Lackaday	1
islands,	1
and	1
from	1
these	1
dark	1
planks	1
the	1
coffin	1
was	1
recommended	1
to	1
be	1
made.	1
No	1
sooner	1
was	1
the	1
carpenter	1
apprised	1
of	1
the	1
order,	1
than	1
taking	1
his	1
rule,	1
he	1
forthwith	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
indifferent	1
promptitude	1
of	1
his	1
character,	1
proceeded	1
into	1
the	1
forecastle	1
and	1
took	1
Queequeg's	1
measure	1
with	1
great	1
accuracy,	1
regularly	1
chalking	1
Queequeg's	1
person	1
as	1
he	1
shifted	1
the	1
rule.	1
"Ah!	1
poor	1
fellow!	1
he'll	1
have	1
to	1
die	1
now,"	1
ejaculated	1
the	1
Long	1
Island	1
sailor.	1
Going	1
to	1
his	1
vice-bench,	1
the	1
carpenter	1
for	1
convenience	1
sake	1
and	1
general	1
reference,	1
now	1
transferringly	1
measured	1
on	1
it	1
the	1
exact	1
length	1
the	1
coffin	1
was	1
to	1
be,	1
and	1
then	1
made	1
the	1
transfer	1
permanent	1
by	1
cutting	1
two	1
notches	1
at	1
its	1
extremities.	1
This	1
done,	1
he	1
marshalled	1
the	1
planks	1
and	1
his	1
tools,	1
and	1
to	1
work.	1
When	1
the	1
last	1
nail	1
was	1
driven,	1
and	1
the	1
lid	1
duly	1
planed	1
and	1
fitted,	1
he	1
lightly	1
shouldered	1
the	1
coffin	1
and	1
went	1
forward	1
with	1
it,	1
inquiring	1
whether	1
they	1
were	1
ready	1
for	1
it	1
yet	1
in	1
that	1
direction.	1
Overhearing	1
the	1
indignant	1
but	1
half-humorous	1
cries	1
with	1
which	1
the	1
people	1
on	1
deck	1
began	1
to	1
drive	1
the	1
coffin	1
away,	1
Queequeg,	1
to	1
every	1
one's	1
consternation,	1
commanded	1
that	1
the	1
thing	1
should	1
be	1
instantly	1
brought	1
to	1
him,	1
nor	1
was	1
there	1
any	1
denying	1
him;	1
seeing	1
that,	1
of	1
all	1
mortals,	1
some	1
dying	1
men	1
are	1
the	1
most	1
tyrannical;	1
and	1
certainly,	1
since	1
they	1
will	1
shortly	1
trouble	1
us	1
so	1
little	1
for	1
evermore,	1
the	1
poor	1
fellows	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
indulged.	1
Leaning	1
over	1
in	1
his	1
hammock,	1
Queequeg	1
long	1
regarded	1
the	1
coffin	1
with	1
an	1
attentive	1
eye.	1
He	1
then	1
called	1
for	1
his	1
harpoon,	1
had	1
the	1
wooden	1
stock	1
drawn	1
from	1
it,	1
and	1
then	1
had	1
the	1
iron	1
part	1
placed	1
in	1
the	1
coffin	1
along	1
with	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
paddles	1
of	1
his	1
boat.	1
All	1
by	1
his	1
own	1
request,	1
also,	1
biscuits	1
were	1
then	1
ranged	1
round	1
the	1
sides	1
within:	1
a	1
flask	1
of	1
fresh	1
water	1
was	1
placed	1
at	1
the	1
head,	1
and	1
a	1
small	1
bag	1
of	1
woody	1
earth	1
scraped	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
hold	1
at	1
the	1
foot;	1
and	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
sail-cloth	1
being	1
rolled	1
up	1
for	1
a	1
pillow,	1
Queequeg	1
now	1
entreated	1
to	1
be	1
lifted	1
into	1
his	1
final	1
bed,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
make	1
trial	1
of	1
its	1
comforts,	1
if	1
any	1
it	1
had.	1
He	1
lay	1
without	1
moving	1
a	1
few	1
minutes,	1
then	1
told	1
one	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
his	1
bag	1
and	1
bring	1
out	1
his	1
little	1
god,	1
Yojo.	1
Then	1
crossing	1
his	1
arms	1
on	1
his	1
breast	1
with	1
Yojo	1
between,	1
he	1
called	1
for	1
the	1
coffin	1
lid	1
(hatch	1
he	1
called	1
it)	1
to	1
be	1
placed	1
over	1
him.	1
The	1
head	1
part	1
turned	1
over	1
with	1
a	1
leather	1
hinge,	1
and	1
there	1
lay	1
Queequeg	1
in	1
his	1
coffin	1
with	1
little	1
but	1
his	1
composed	1
countenance	1
in	1
view.	1
"Rarmai"	1
(it	1
will	1
do;	1
it	1
is	1
easy),	1
he	1
murmured	1
at	1
last,	1
and	1
signed	1
to	1
be	1
replaced	1
in	1
his	1
hammock.	1
But	1
ere	1
this	1
was	1
done,	1
Pip,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
slily	1
hovering	1
near	1
by	1
all	1
this	1
while,	1
drew	1
nigh	1
to	1
him	1
where	1
he	1
lay,	1
and	1
with	1
soft	1
sobbings,	1
took	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
hand;	1
in	1
the	1
other,	1
holding	1
his	1
tambourine.	1
"Poor	1
rover!	1
will	1
ye	1
never	1
have	1
done	1
with	1
all	1
this	1
weary	1
roving?	1
where	1
go	1
ye	1
now?	1
But	1
if	1
the	1
currents	1
carry	1
ye	1
to	1
those	1
sweet	1
Antilles	1
where	1
the	1
beaches	1
are	1
only	1
beat	1
with	1
water-lilies,	1
will	1
ye	1
do	1
one	1
little	1
errand	1
for	1
me?	1
Seek	1
out	1
one	1
Pip,	1
who's	1
now	1
been	1
missing	1
long:	1
I	1
think	1
he's	1
in	1
those	1
far	1
Antilles.	1
If	1
ye	1
find	1
him,	1
then	1
comfort	1
him;	1
for	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
very	1
sad;	1
for	1
look!	1
he's	1
left	1
his	1
tambourine	1
behind;--I	1
found	1
it.	1
Rig-a-dig,	1
dig,	1
dig!	1
Now,	1
Queequeg,	1
die;	1
and	1
I'll	1
beat	1
ye	1
your	1
dying	1
march."	1
"I	1
have	1
heard,"	1
murmured	1
Starbuck,	1
gazing	1
down	1
the	1
scuttle,	1
"that	1
in	1
violent	1
fevers,	1
men,	1
all	1
ignorance,	1
have	1
talked	1
in	1
ancient	1
tongues;	1
and	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
mystery	1
is	1
probed,	1
it	1
turns	1
out	1
always	1
that	1
in	1
their	1
wholly	1
forgotten	1
childhood	1
those	1
ancient	1
tongues	1
had	1
been	1
really	1
spoken	1
in	1
their	1
hearing	1
by	1
some	1
lofty	1
scholars.	1
So,	1
to	1
my	1
fond	1
faith,	1
poor	1
Pip,	1
in	1
this	1
strange	1
sweetness	1
of	1
his	1
lunacy,	1
brings	1
heavenly	1
vouchers	1
of	1
all	1
our	1
heavenly	1
homes.	1
Where	1
learned	1
he	1
that,	1
but	1
there?--Hark!	1
he	1
speaks	1
again:	1
but	1
more	1
wildly	1
now."	1
"Form	1
two	1
and	1
two!	1
Let's	1
make	1
a	1
General	1
of	1
him!	1
Ho,	1
where's	1
his	1
harpoon?	1
Lay	1
it	1
across	1
here.--Rig-a-dig,	1
dig,	1
dig!	1
huzza!	1
Oh	1
for	1
a	1
game	1
cock	1
now	1
to	1
sit	1
upon	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
crow!	1
Queequeg	1
dies	1
game!--mind	1
ye	1
that;	1
Queequeg	1
dies	1
game!--take	1
ye	1
good	1
heed	1
of	1
that;	1
Queequeg	1
dies	1
game!	1
I	1
say;	1
game,	1
game,	1
game!	1
but	1
base	1
little	1
Pip,	1
he	1
died	1
a	1
coward;	1
died	1
all	1
a'shiver;--out	1
upon	1
Pip!	1
Hark	1
ye;	1
if	1
ye	1
find	1
Pip,	1
tell	1
all	1
the	1
Antilles	1
he's	1
a	1
runaway;	1
a	1
coward,	1
a	1
coward,	1
a	1
coward!	1
Tell	1
them	1
he	1
jumped	1
from	1
a	1
whale-boat!	1
I'd	1
never	1
beat	1
my	1
tambourine	1
over	1
base	1
Pip,	1
and	1
hail	1
him	1
General,	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
once	1
more	1
dying	1
here.	1
No,	1
no!	1
shame	1
upon	1
all	1
cowards--shame	1
upon	1
them!	1
Let	1
'em	1
go	1
drown	1
like	1
Pip,	1
that	1
jumped	1
from	1
a	1
whale-boat.	1
Shame!	1
shame!"	1
During	1
all	1
this,	1
Queequeg	1
lay	1
with	1
closed	1
eyes,	1
as	1
if	1
in	1
a	1
dream.	1
Pip	1
was	1
led	1
away,	1
and	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
was	1
replaced	1
in	1
his	1
hammock.	1
But	1
now	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
apparently	1
made	1
every	1
preparation	1
for	1
death;	1
now	1
that	1
his	1
coffin	1
was	1
proved	1
a	1
good	1
fit,	1
Queequeg	1
suddenly	1
rallied;	1
soon	1
there	1
seemed	1
no	1
need	1
of	1
the	1
carpenter's	1
box:	1
and	1
thereupon,	1
when	1
some	1
expressed	1
their	1
delighted	1
surprise,	1
he,	1
in	1
substance,	1
said,	1
that	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
his	1
sudden	1
convalescence	1
was	1
this;--at	1
a	1
critical	1
moment,	1
he	1
had	1
just	1
recalled	1
a	1
little	1
duty	1
ashore,	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
leaving	1
undone;	1
and	1
therefore	1
had	1
changed	1
his	1
mind	1
about	1
dying:	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
die	1
yet,	1
he	1
averred.	1
They	1
asked	1
him,	1
then,	1
whether	1
to	1
live	1
or	1
die	1
was	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
sovereign	1
will	1
and	1
pleasure.	1
He	1
answered,	1
certainly.	1
In	1
a	1
word,	1
it	1
was	1
Queequeg's	1
conceit,	1
that	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
to	1
live,	1
mere	1
sickness	1
could	1
not	1
kill	1
him:	1
nothing	1
but	1
a	1
whale,	1
or	1
a	1
gale,	1
or	1
some	1
violent,	1
ungovernable,	1
unintelligent	1
destroyer	1
of	1
that	1
sort.	1
Now,	1
there	1
is	1
this	1
noteworthy	1
difference	1
between	1
savage	1
and	1
civilized;	1
that	1
while	1
a	1
sick,	1
civilized	1
man	1
may	1
be	1
six	1
months	1
convalescing,	1
generally	1
speaking,	1
a	1
sick	1
savage	1
is	1
almost	1
half-well	1
again	1
in	1
a	1
day.	1
So,	1
in	1
good	1
time	1
my	1
Queequeg	1
gained	1
strength;	1
and	1
at	1
length	1
after	1
sitting	1
on	1
the	1
windlass	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
indolent	1
days	1
(but	1
eating	1
with	1
a	1
vigorous	1
appetite)	1
he	1
suddenly	1
leaped	1
to	1
his	1
feet,	1
threw	1
out	1
his	1
arms	1
and	1
legs,	1
gave	1
himself	1
a	1
good	1
stretching,	1
yawned	1
a	1
little	1
bit,	1
and	1
then	1
springing	1
into	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
his	1
hoisted	1
boat,	1
and	1
poising	1
a	1
harpoon,	1
pronounced	1
himself	1
fit	1
for	1
a	1
fight.	1
With	1
a	1
wild	1
whimsiness,	1
he	1
now	1
used	1
his	1
coffin	1
for	1
a	1
sea-chest;	1
and	1
emptying	1
into	1
it	1
his	1
canvas	1
bag	1
of	1
clothes,	1
set	1
them	1
in	1
order	1
there.	1
Many	1
spare	1
hours	1
he	1
spent,	1
in	1
carving	1
the	1
lid	1
with	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
grotesque	1
figures	1
and	1
drawings;	1
and	1
it	1
seemed	1
that	1
hereby	1
he	1
was	1
striving,	1
in	1
his	1
rude	1
way,	1
to	1
copy	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
twisted	1
tattooing	1
on	1
his	1
body.	1
And	1
this	1
tattooing	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
a	1
departed	1
prophet	1
and	1
seer	1
of	1
his	1
island,	1
who,	1
by	1
those	1
hieroglyphic	1
marks,	1
had	1
written	1
out	1
on	1
his	1
body	1
a	1
complete	1
theory	1
of	1
the	1
heavens	1
and	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
a	1
mystical	1
treatise	1
on	1
the	1
art	1
of	1
attaining	1
truth;	1
so	1
that	1
Queequeg	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
proper	1
person	1
was	1
a	1
riddle	1
to	1
unfold;	1
a	1
wondrous	1
work	1
in	1
one	1
volume;	1
but	1
whose	1
mysteries	1
not	1
even	1
himself	1
could	1
read,	1
though	1
his	1
own	1
live	1
heart	1
beat	1
against	1
them;	1
and	1
these	1
mysteries	1
were	1
therefore	1
destined	1
in	1
the	1
end	1
to	1
moulder	1
away	1
with	1
the	1
living	1
parchment	1
whereon	1
they	1
were	1
inscribed,	1
and	1
so	1
be	1
unsolved	1
to	1
the	1
last.	1
And	1
this	1
thought	1
it	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
which	1
suggested	1
to	1
Ahab	1
that	1
wild	1
exclamation	1
of	1
his,	1
when	1
one	1
morning	1
turning	1
away	1
from	1
surveying	1
poor	1
Queequeg--"Oh,	1
devilish	1
tantalization	1
of	1
the	1
gods!"	1
CHAPTER	1
111	1
The	1
Pacific.	1
When	1
gliding	1
by	1
the	1
Bashee	1
isles	1
we	1
emerged	1
at	1
last	1
upon	1
the	1
great	1
South	1
Sea;	1
were	1
it	1
not	1
for	1
other	1
things,	1
I	1
could	1
have	1
greeted	1
my	1
dear	1
Pacific	1
with	1
uncounted	1
thanks,	1
for	1
now	1
the	1
long	1
supplication	1
of	1
my	1
youth	1
was	1
answered;	1
that	1
serene	1
ocean	1
rolled	1
eastwards	1
from	1
me	1
a	1
thousand	1
leagues	1
of	1
blue.	1
There	1
is,	1
one	1
knows	1
not	1
what	1
sweet	1
mystery	1
about	1
this	1
sea,	1
whose	1
gently	1
awful	1
stirrings	1
seem	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
some	1
hidden	1
soul	1
beneath;	1
like	1
those	1
fabled	1
undulations	1
of	1
the	1
Ephesian	1
sod	1
over	1
the	1
buried	1
Evangelist	1
St.	1
John.	1
And	1
meet	1
it	1
is,	1
that	1
over	1
these	1
sea-pastures,	1
wide-rolling	1
watery	1
prairies	1
and	1
Potters'	1
Fields	1
of	1
all	1
four	1
continents,	1
the	1
waves	1
should	1
rise	1
and	1
fall,	1
and	1
ebb	1
and	1
flow	1
unceasingly;	1
for	1
here,	1
millions	1
of	1
mixed	1
shades	1
and	1
shadows,	1
drowned	1
dreams,	1
somnambulisms,	1
reveries;	1
all	1
that	1
we	1
call	1
lives	1
and	1
souls,	1
lie	1
dreaming,	1
dreaming,	1
still;	1
tossing	1
like	1
slumberers	1
in	1
their	1
beds;	1
the	1
ever-rolling	1
waves	1
but	1
made	1
so	1
by	1
their	1
restlessness.	1
To	1
any	1
meditative	1
Magian	1
rover,	1
this	1
serene	1
Pacific,	1
once	1
beheld,	1
must	1
ever	1
after	1
be	1
the	1
sea	1
of	1
his	1
adoption.	1
It	1
rolls	1
the	1
midmost	1
waters	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
the	1
Indian	1
ocean	1
and	1
Atlantic	1
being	1
but	1
its	1
arms.	1
The	1
same	1
waves	1
wash	1
the	1
moles	1
of	1
the	1
new-built	1
Californian	1
towns,	1
but	1
yesterday	1
planted	1
by	1
the	1
recentest	1
race	1
of	1
men,	1
and	1
lave	1
the	1
faded	1
but	1
still	1
gorgeous	1
skirts	1
of	1
Asiatic	1
lands,	1
older	1
than	1
Abraham;	1
while	1
all	1
between	1
float	1
milky-ways	1
of	1
coral	1
isles,	1
and	1
low-lying,	1
endless,	1
unknown	1
Archipelagoes,	1
and	1
impenetrable	1
Japans.	1
Thus	1
this	1
mysterious,	1
divine	1
Pacific	1
zones	1
the	1
world's	1
whole	1
bulk	1
about;	1
makes	1
all	1
coasts	1
one	1
bay	1
to	1
it;	1
seems	1
the	1
tide-beating	1
heart	1
of	1
earth.	1
Lifted	1
by	1
those	1
eternal	1
swells,	1
you	1
needs	1
must	1
own	1
the	1
seductive	1
god,	1
bowing	1
your	1
head	1
to	1
Pan.	1
But	1
few	1
thoughts	1
of	1
Pan	1
stirred	1
Ahab's	1
brain,	1
as	1
standing	1
like	1
an	1
iron	1
statue	1
at	1
his	1
accustomed	1
place	1
beside	1
the	1
mizen	1
rigging,	1
with	1
one	1
nostril	1
he	1
unthinkingly	1
snuffed	1
the	1
sugary	1
musk	1
from	1
the	1
Bashee	1
isles	1
(in	1
whose	1
sweet	1
woods	1
mild	1
lovers	1
must	1
be	1
walking),	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
other	1
consciously	1
inhaled	1
the	1
salt	1
breath	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
found	1
sea;	1
that	1
sea	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
hated	1
White	1
Whale	1
must	1
even	1
then	1
be	1
swimming.	1
Launched	1
at	1
length	1
upon	1
these	1
almost	1
final	1
waters,	1
and	1
gliding	1
towards	1
the	1
Japanese	1
cruising-ground,	1
the	1
old	1
man's	1
purpose	1
intensified	1
itself.	1
His	1
firm	1
lips	1
met	1
like	1
the	1
lips	1
of	1
a	1
vice;	1
the	1
Delta	1
of	1
his	1
forehead's	1
veins	1
swelled	1
like	1
overladen	1
brooks;	1
in	1
his	1
very	1
sleep,	1
his	1
ringing	1
cry	1
ran	1
through	1
the	1
vaulted	1
hull,	1
"Stern	1
all!	1
the	1
White	1
Whale	1
spouts	1
thick	1
blood!"	1
CHAPTER	1
112	1
The	1
Blacksmith.	1
Availing	1
himself	1
of	1
the	1
mild,	1
summer-cool	1
weather	1
that	1
now	1
reigned	1
in	1
these	1
latitudes,	1
and	1
in	1
preparation	1
for	1
the	1
peculiarly	1
active	1
pursuits	1
shortly	1
to	1
be	1
anticipated,	1
Perth,	1
the	1
begrimed,	1
blistered	1
old	1
blacksmith,	1
had	1
not	1
removed	1
his	1
portable	1
forge	1
to	1
the	1
hold	1
again,	1
after	1
concluding	1
his	1
contributory	1
work	1
for	1
Ahab's	1
leg,	1
but	1
still	1
retained	1
it	1
on	1
deck,	1
fast	1
lashed	1
to	1
ringbolts	1
by	1
the	1
foremast;	1
being	1
now	1
almost	1
incessantly	1
invoked	1
by	1
the	1
headsmen,	1
and	1
harpooneers,	1
and	1
bowsmen	1
to	1
do	1
some	1
little	1
job	1
for	1
them;	1
altering,	1
or	1
repairing,	1
or	1
new	1
shaping	1
their	1
various	1
weapons	1
and	1
boat	1
furniture.	1
Often	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
surrounded	1
by	1
an	1
eager	1
circle,	1
all	1
waiting	1
to	1
be	1
served;	1
holding	1
boat-spades,	1
pike-heads,	1
harpoons,	1
and	1
lances,	1
and	1
jealously	1
watching	1
his	1
every	1
sooty	1
movement,	1
as	1
he	1
toiled.	1
Nevertheless,	1
this	1
old	1
man's	1
was	1
a	1
patient	1
hammer	1
wielded	1
by	1
a	1
patient	1
arm.	1
No	1
murmur,	1
no	1
impatience,	1
no	1
petulance	1
did	1
come	1
from	1
him.	1
Silent,	1
slow,	1
and	1
solemn;	1
bowing	1
over	1
still	1
further	1
his	1
chronically	1
broken	1
back,	1
he	1
toiled	1
away,	1
as	1
if	1
toil	1
were	1
life	1
itself,	1
and	1
the	1
heavy	1
beating	1
of	1
his	1
hammer	1
the	1
heavy	1
beating	1
of	1
his	1
heart.	1
And	1
so	1
it	1
was.--Most	1
miserable!	1
A	1
peculiar	1
walk	1
in	1
this	1
old	1
man,	1
a	1
certain	1
slight	1
but	1
painful	1
appearing	1
yawing	1
in	1
his	1
gait,	1
had	1
at	1
an	1
early	1
period	1
of	1
the	1
voyage	1
excited	1
the	1
curiosity	1
of	1
the	1
mariners.	1
And	1
to	1
the	1
importunity	1
of	1
their	1
persisted	1
questionings	1
he	1
had	1
finally	1
given	1
in;	1
and	1
so	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
every	1
one	1
now	1
knew	1
the	1
shameful	1
story	1
of	1
his	1
wretched	1
fate.	1
Belated,	1
and	1
not	1
innocently,	1
one	1
bitter	1
winter's	1
midnight,	1
on	1
the	1
road	1
running	1
between	1
two	1
country	1
towns,	1
the	1
blacksmith	1
half-stupidly	1
felt	1
the	1
deadly	1
numbness	1
stealing	1
over	1
him,	1
and	1
sought	1
refuge	1
in	1
a	1
leaning,	1
dilapidated	1
barn.	1
The	1
issue	1
was,	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
the	1
extremities	1
of	1
both	1
feet.	1
Out	1
of	1
this	1
revelation,	1
part	1
by	1
part,	1
at	1
last	1
came	1
out	1
the	1
four	1
acts	1
of	1
the	1
gladness,	1
and	1
the	1
one	1
long,	1
and	1
as	1
yet	1
uncatastrophied	1
fifth	1
act	1
of	1
the	1
grief	1
of	1
his	1
life's	1
drama.	1
He	1
was	1
an	1
old	1
man,	1
who,	1
at	1
the	1
age	1
of	1
nearly	1
sixty,	1
had	1
postponedly	1
encountered	1
that	1
thing	1
in	1
sorrow's	1
technicals	1
called	1
ruin.	1
He	1
had	1
been	1
an	1
artisan	1
of	1
famed	1
excellence,	1
and	1
with	1
plenty	1
to	1
do;	1
owned	1
a	1
house	1
and	1
garden;	1
embraced	1
a	1
youthful,	1
daughter-like,	1
loving	1
wife,	1
and	1
three	1
blithe,	1
ruddy	1
children;	1
every	1
Sunday	1
went	1
to	1
a	1
cheerful-looking	1
church,	1
planted	1
in	1
a	1
grove.	1
But	1
one	1
night,	1
under	1
cover	1
of	1
darkness,	1
and	1
further	1
concealed	1
in	1
a	1
most	1
cunning	1
disguisement,	1
a	1
desperate	1
burglar	1
slid	1
into	1
his	1
happy	1
home,	1
and	1
robbed	1
them	1
all	1
of	1
everything.	1
And	1
darker	1
yet	1
to	1
tell,	1
the	1
blacksmith	1
himself	1
did	1
ignorantly	1
conduct	1
this	1
burglar	1
into	1
his	1
family's	1
heart.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
Bottle	1
Conjuror!	1
Upon	1
the	1
opening	1
of	1
that	1
fatal	1
cork,	1
forth	1
flew	1
the	1
fiend,	1
and	1
shrivelled	1
up	1
his	1
home.	1
Now,	1
for	1
prudent,	1
most	1
wise,	1
and	1
economic	1
reasons,	1
the	1
blacksmith's	1
shop	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
basement	1
of	1
his	1
dwelling,	1
but	1
with	1
a	1
separate	1
entrance	1
to	1
it;	1
so	1
that	1
always	1
had	1
the	1
young	1
and	1
loving	1
healthy	1
wife	1
listened	1
with	1
no	1
unhappy	1
nervousness,	1
but	1
with	1
vigorous	1
pleasure,	1
to	1
the	1
stout	1
ringing	1
of	1
her	1
young-armed	1
old	1
husband's	1
hammer;	1
whose	1
reverberations,	1
muffled	1
by	1
passing	1
through	1
the	1
floors	1
and	1
walls,	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
her,	1
not	1
unsweetly,	1
in	1
her	1
nursery;	1
and	1
so,	1
to	1
stout	1
Labor's	1
iron	1
lullaby,	1
the	1
blacksmith's	1
infants	1
were	1
rocked	1
to	1
slumber.	1
Oh,	1
woe	1
on	1
woe!	1
Oh,	1
Death,	1
why	1
canst	1
thou	1
not	1
sometimes	1
be	1
timely?	1
Hadst	1
thou	1
taken	1
this	1
old	1
blacksmith	1
to	1
thyself	1
ere	1
his	1
full	1
ruin	1
came	1
upon	1
him,	1
then	1
had	1
the	1
young	1
widow	1
had	1
a	1
delicious	1
grief,	1
and	1
her	1
orphans	1
a	1
truly	1
venerable,	1
legendary	1
sire	1
to	1
dream	1
of	1
in	1
their	1
after	1
years;	1
and	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
a	1
care-killing	1
competency.	1
But	1
Death	1
plucked	1
down	1
some	1
virtuous	1
elder	1
brother,	1
on	1
whose	1
whistling	1
daily	1
toil	1
solely	1
hung	1
the	1
responsibilities	1
of	1
some	1
other	1
family,	1
and	1
left	1
the	1
worse	1
than	1
useless	1
old	1
man	1
standing,	1
till	1
the	1
hideous	1
rot	1
of	1
life	1
should	1
make	1
him	1
easier	1
to	1
harvest.	1
Why	1
tell	1
the	1
whole?	1
The	1
blows	1
of	1
the	1
basement	1
hammer	1
every	1
day	1
grew	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
between;	1
and	1
each	1
blow	1
every	1
day	1
grew	1
fainter	1
than	1
the	1
last;	1
the	1
wife	1
sat	1
frozen	1
at	1
the	1
window,	1
with	1
tearless	1
eyes,	1
glitteringly	1
gazing	1
into	1
the	1
weeping	1
faces	1
of	1
her	1
children;	1
the	1
bellows	1
fell;	1
the	1
forge	1
choked	1
up	1
with	1
cinders;	1
the	1
house	1
was	1
sold;	1
the	1
mother	1
dived	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
long	1
church-yard	1
grass;	1
her	1
children	1
twice	1
followed	1
her	1
thither;	1
and	1
the	1
houseless,	1
familyless	1
old	1
man	1
staggered	1
off	1
a	1
vagabond	1
in	1
crape;	1
his	1
every	1
woe	1
unreverenced;	1
his	1
grey	1
head	1
a	1
scorn	1
to	1
flaxen	1
curls!	1
Death	1
seems	1
the	1
only	1
desirable	1
sequel	1
for	1
a	1
career	1
like	1
this;	1
but	1
Death	1
is	1
only	1
a	1
launching	1
into	1
the	1
region	1
of	1
the	1
strange	1
Untried;	1
it	1
is	1
but	1
the	1
first	1
salutation	1
to	1
the	1
possibilities	1
of	1
the	1
immense	1
Remote,	1
the	1
Wild,	1
the	1
Watery,	1
the	1
Unshored;	1
therefore,	1
to	1
the	1
death-longing	1
eyes	1
of	1
such	1
men,	1
who	1
still	1
have	1
left	1
in	1
them	1
some	1
interior	1
compunctions	1
against	1
suicide,	1
does	1
the	1
all-contributed	1
and	1
all-receptive	1
ocean	1
alluringly	1
spread	1
forth	1
his	1
whole	1
plain	1
of	1
unimaginable,	1
taking	1
terrors,	1
and	1
wonderful,	1
new-life	1
adventures;	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
infinite	1
Pacifics,	1
the	1
thousand	1
mermaids	1
sing	1
to	1
them--"Come	1
hither,	1
broken-hearted;	1
here	1
is	1
another	1
life	1
without	1
the	1
guilt	1
of	1
intermediate	1
death;	1
here	1
are	1
wonders	1
supernatural,	1
without	1
dying	1
for	1
them.	1
Come	1
hither!	1
bury	1
thyself	1
in	1
a	1
life	1
which,	1
to	1
your	1
now	1
equally	1
abhorred	1
and	1
abhorring,	1
landed	1
world,	1
is	1
more	1
oblivious	1
than	1
death.	1
Come	1
hither!	1
put	1
up	1
THY	1
gravestone,	1
too,	1
within	1
the	1
churchyard,	1
and	1
come	1
hither,	1
till	1
we	1
marry	1
thee!"	1
Hearkening	1
to	1
these	1
voices,	1
East	1
and	1
West,	1
by	1
early	1
sunrise,	1
and	1
by	1
fall	1
of	1
eve,	1
the	1
blacksmith's	1
soul	1
responded,	1
Aye,	1
I	1
come!	1
And	1
so	1
Perth	1
went	1
a-whaling.	1
CHAPTER	1
113	1
The	1
Forge.	1
With	1
matted	1
beard,	1
and	1
swathed	1
in	1
a	1
bristling	1
shark-skin	1
apron,	1
about	1
mid-day,	1
Perth	1
was	1
standing	1
between	1
his	1
forge	1
and	1
anvil,	1
the	1
latter	1
placed	1
upon	1
an	1
iron-wood	1
log,	1
with	1
one	1
hand	1
holding	1
a	1
pike-head	1
in	1
the	1
coals,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
other	1
at	1
his	1
forge's	1
lungs,	1
when	1
Captain	1
Ahab	1
came	1
along,	1
carrying	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
a	1
small	1
rusty-looking	1
leathern	1
bag.	1
While	1
yet	1
a	1
little	1
distance	1
from	1
the	1
forge,	1
moody	1
Ahab	1
paused;	1
till	1
at	1
last,	1
Perth,	1
withdrawing	1
his	1
iron	1
from	1
the	1
fire,	1
began	1
hammering	1
it	1
upon	1
the	1
anvil--the	1
red	1
mass	1
sending	1
off	1
the	1
sparks	1
in	1
thick	1
hovering	1
flights,	1
some	1
of	1
which	1
flew	1
close	1
to	1
Ahab.	1
"Are	1
these	1
thy	1
Mother	1
Carey's	1
chickens,	1
Perth?	1
they	1
are	1
always	1
flying	1
in	1
thy	1
wake;	1
birds	1
of	1
good	1
omen,	1
too,	1
but	1
not	1
to	1
all;--look	1
here,	1
they	1
burn;	1
but	1
thou--thou	1
liv'st	1
among	1
them	1
without	1
a	1
scorch."	1
"Because	1
I	1
am	1
scorched	1
all	1
over,	1
Captain	1
Ahab,"	1
answered	1
Perth,	1
resting	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
on	1
his	1
hammer;	1
"I	1
am	1
past	1
scorching;	1
not	1
easily	1
can'st	1
thou	1
scorch	1
a	1
scar."	1
"Well,	1
well;	1
no	1
more.	1
Thy	1
shrunk	1
voice	1
sounds	1
too	1
calmly,	1
sanely	1
woeful	1
to	1
me.	1
In	1
no	1
Paradise	1
myself,	1
I	1
am	1
impatient	1
of	1
all	1
misery	1
in	1
others	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
mad.	1
Thou	1
should'st	1
go	1
mad,	1
blacksmith;	1
say,	1
why	1
dost	1
thou	1
not	1
go	1
mad?	1
How	1
can'st	1
thou	1
endure	1
without	1
being	1
mad?	1
Do	1
the	1
heavens	1
yet	1
hate	1
thee,	1
that	1
thou	1
can'st	1
not	1
go	1
mad?--What	1
wert	1
thou	1
making	1
there?"	1
"Welding	1
an	1
old	1
pike-head,	1
sir;	1
there	1
were	1
seams	1
and	1
dents	1
in	1
it."	1
"And	1
can'st	1
thou	1
make	1
it	1
all	1
smooth	1
again,	1
blacksmith,	1
after	1
such	1
hard	1
usage	1
as	1
it	1
had?"	1
"I	1
think	1
so,	1
sir."	1
"And	1
I	1
suppose	1
thou	1
can'st	1
smoothe	1
almost	1
any	1
seams	1
and	1
dents;	1
never	1
mind	1
how	1
hard	1
the	1
metal,	1
blacksmith?"	1
"Aye,	1
sir,	1
I	1
think	1
I	1
can;	1
all	1
seams	1
and	1
dents	1
but	1
one."	1
"Look	1
ye	1
here,	1
then,"	1
cried	1
Ahab,	1
passionately	1
advancing,	1
and	1
leaning	1
with	1
both	1
hands	1
on	1
Perth's	1
shoulders;	1
"look	1
ye	1
here--HERE--can	1
ye	1
smoothe	1
out	1
a	1
seam	1
like	1
this,	1
blacksmith,"	1
sweeping	1
one	1
hand	1
across	1
his	1
ribbed	1
brow;	1
"if	1
thou	1
could'st,	1
blacksmith,	1
glad	1
enough	1
would	1
I	1
lay	1
my	1
head	1
upon	1
thy	1
anvil,	1
and	1
feel	1
thy	1
heaviest	1
hammer	1
between	1
my	1
eyes.	1
Answer!	1
Can'st	1
thou	1
smoothe	1
this	1
seam?"	1
"Oh!	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
one,	1
sir!	1
Said	1
I	1
not	1
all	1
seams	1
and	1
dents	1
but	1
one?"	1
"Aye,	1
blacksmith,	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
one;	1
aye,	1
man,	1
it	1
is	1
unsmoothable;	1
for	1
though	1
thou	1
only	1
see'st	1
it	1
here	1
in	1
my	1
flesh,	1
it	1
has	1
worked	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
bone	1
of	1
my	1
skull--THAT	1
is	1
all	1
wrinkles!	1
But,	1
away	1
with	1
child's	1
play;	1
no	1
more	1
gaffs	1
and	1
pikes	1
to-day.	1
Look	1
ye	1
here!"	1
jingling	1
the	1
leathern	1
bag,	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
full	1
of	1
gold	1
coins.	1
"I,	1
too,	1
want	1
a	1
harpoon	1
made;	1
one	1
that	1
a	1
thousand	1
yoke	1
of	1
fiends	1
could	1
not	1
part,	1
Perth;	1
something	1
that	1
will	1
stick	1
in	1
a	1
whale	1
like	1
his	1
own	1
fin-bone.	1
There's	1
the	1
stuff,"	1
flinging	1
the	1
pouch	1
upon	1
the	1
anvil.	1
"Look	1
ye,	1
blacksmith,	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
gathered	1
nail-stubbs	1
of	1
the	1
steel	1
shoes	1
of	1
racing	1
horses."	1
"Horse-shoe	1
stubbs,	1
sir?	1
Why,	1
Captain	1
Ahab,	1
thou	1
hast	1
here,	1
then,	1
the	1
best	1
and	1
stubbornest	1
stuff	1
we	1
blacksmiths	1
ever	1
work."	1
"I	1
know	1
it,	1
old	1
man;	1
these	1
stubbs	1
will	1
weld	1
together	1
like	1
glue	1
from	1
the	1
melted	1
bones	1
of	1
murderers.	1
Quick!	1
forge	1
me	1
the	1
harpoon.	1
And	1
forge	1
me	1
first,	1
twelve	1
rods	1
for	1
its	1
shank;	1
then	1
wind,	1
and	1
twist,	1
and	1
hammer	1
these	1
twelve	1
together	1
like	1
the	1
yarns	1
and	1
strands	1
of	1
a	1
tow-line.	1
Quick!	1
I'll	1
blow	1
the	1
fire."	1
When	1
at	1
last	1
the	1
twelve	1
rods	1
were	1
made,	1
Ahab	1
tried	1
them,	1
one	1
by	1
one,	1
by	1
spiralling	1
them,	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
hand,	1
round	1
a	1
long,	1
heavy	1
iron	1
bolt.	1
"A	1
flaw!"	1
rejecting	1
the	1
last	1
one.	1
"Work	1
that	1
over	1
again,	1
Perth."	1
This	1
done,	1
Perth	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
begin	1
welding	1
the	1
twelve	1
into	1
one,	1
when	1
Ahab	1
stayed	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
said	1
he	1
would	1
weld	1
his	1
own	1
iron.	1
As,	1
then,	1
with	1
regular,	1
gasping	1
hems,	1
he	1
hammered	1
on	1
the	1
anvil,	1
Perth	1
passing	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
glowing	1
rods,	1
one	1
after	1
the	1
other,	1
and	1
the	1
hard	1
pressed	1
forge	1
shooting	1
up	1
its	1
intense	1
straight	1
flame,	1
the	1
Parsee	1
passed	1
silently,	1
and	1
bowing	1
over	1
his	1
head	1
towards	1
the	1
fire,	1
seemed	1
invoking	1
some	1
curse	1
or	1
some	1
blessing	1
on	1
the	1
toil.	1
But,	1
as	1
Ahab	1
looked	1
up,	1
he	1
slid	1
aside.	1
"What's	1
that	1
bunch	1
of	1
lucifers	1
dodging	1
about	1
there	1
for?"	1
muttered	1
Stubb,	1
looking	1
on	1
from	1
the	1
forecastle.	1
"That	1
Parsee	1
smells	1
fire	1
like	1
a	1
fusee;	1
and	1
smells	1
of	1
it	1
himself,	1
like	1
a	1
hot	1
musket's	1
powder-pan."	1
At	1
last	1
the	1
shank,	1
in	1
one	1
complete	1
rod,	1
received	1
its	1
final	1
heat;	1
and	1
as	1
Perth,	1
to	1
temper	1
it,	1
plunged	1
it	1
all	1
hissing	1
into	1
the	1
cask	1
of	1
water	1
near	1
by,	1
the	1
scalding	1
steam	1
shot	1
up	1
into	1
Ahab's	1
bent	1
face.	1
"Would'st	1
thou	1
brand	1
me,	1
Perth?"	1
wincing	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
with	1
the	1
pain;	1
"have	1
I	1
been	1
but	1
forging	1
my	1
own	1
branding-iron,	1
then?"	1
"Pray	1
God,	1
not	1
that;	1
yet	1
I	1
fear	1
something,	1
Captain	1
Ahab.	1
Is	1
not	1
this	1
harpoon	1
for	1
the	1
White	1
Whale?"	1
"For	1
the	1
white	1
fiend!	1
But	1
now	1
for	1
the	1
barbs;	1
thou	1
must	1
make	1
them	1
thyself,	1
man.	1
Here	1
are	1
my	1
razors--the	1
best	1
of	1
steel;	1
here,	1
and	1
make	1
the	1
barbs	1
sharp	1
as	1
the	1
needle-sleet	1
of	1
the	1
Icy	1
Sea."	1
For	1
a	1
moment,	1
the	1
old	1
blacksmith	1
eyed	1
the	1
razors	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
would	1
fain	1
not	1
use	1
them.	1
"Take	1
them,	1
man,	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
need	1
for	1
them;	1
for	1
I	1
now	1
neither	1
shave,	1
sup,	1
nor	1
pray	1
till--but	1
here--to	1
work!"	1
Fashioned	1
at	1
last	1
into	1
an	1
arrowy	1
shape,	1
and	1
welded	1
by	1
Perth	1
to	1
the	1
shank,	1
the	1
steel	1
soon	1
pointed	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
iron;	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
blacksmith	1
was	1
about	1
giving	1
the	1
barbs	1
their	1
final	1
heat,	1
prior	1
to	1
tempering	1
them,	1
he	1
cried	1
to	1
Ahab	1
to	1
place	1
the	1
water-cask	1
near.	1
"No,	1
no--no	1
water	1
for	1
that;	1
I	1
want	1
it	1
of	1
the	1
true	1
death-temper.	1
Ahoy,	1
there!	1
Tashtego,	1
Queequeg,	1
Daggoo!	1
What	1
say	1
ye,	1
pagans!	1
Will	1
ye	1
give	1
me	1
as	1
much	1
blood	1
as	1
will	1
cover	1
this	1
barb?"	1
holding	1
it	1
high	1
up.	1
A	1
cluster	1
of	1
dark	1
nods	1
replied,	1
Yes.	1
Three	1
punctures	1
were	1
made	1
in	1
the	1
heathen	1
flesh,	1
and	1
the	1
White	1
Whale's	1
barbs	1
were	1
then	1
tempered.	1
"Ego	1
non	1
baptizo	1
te	1
in	1
nomine	1
patris,	1
sed	1
in	1
nomine	1
diaboli!"	1
deliriously	1
howled	1
Ahab,	1
as	1
the	1
malignant	1
iron	1
scorchingly	1
devoured	1
the	1
baptismal	1
blood.	1
Now,	1
mustering	1
the	1
spare	1
poles	1
from	1
below,	1
and	1
selecting	1
one	1
of	1
hickory,	1
with	1
the	1
bark	1
still	1
investing	1
it,	1
Ahab	1
fitted	1
the	1
end	1
to	1
the	1
socket	1
of	1
the	1
iron.	1
A	1
coil	1
of	1
new	1
tow-line	1
was	1
then	1
unwound,	1
and	1
some	1
fathoms	1
of	1
it	1
taken	1
to	1
the	1
windlass,	1
and	1
stretched	1
to	1
a	1
great	1
tension.	1
Pressing	1
his	1
foot	1
upon	1
it,	1
till	1
the	1
rope	1
hummed	1
like	1
a	1
harp-string,	1
then	1
eagerly	1
bending	1
over	1
it,	1
and	1
seeing	1
no	1
strandings,	1
Ahab	1
exclaimed,	1
"Good!	1
and	1
now	1
for	1
the	1
seizings."	1
At	1
one	1
extremity	1
the	1
rope	1
was	1
unstranded,	1
and	1
the	1
separate	1
spread	1
yarns	1
were	1
all	1
braided	1
and	1
woven	1
round	1
the	1
socket	1
of	1
the	1
harpoon;	1
the	1
pole	1
was	1
then	1
driven	1
hard	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
socket;	1
from	1
the	1
lower	1
end	1
the	1
rope	1
was	1
traced	1
half-way	1
along	1
the	1
pole's	1
length,	1
and	1
firmly	1
secured	1
so,	1
with	1
intertwistings	1
of	1
twine.	1
This	1
done,	1
pole,	1
iron,	1
and	1
rope--like	1
the	1
Three	1
Fates--remained	1
inseparable,	1
and	1
Ahab	1
moodily	1
stalked	1
away	1
with	1
the	1
weapon;	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
his	1
ivory	1
leg,	1
and	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
hickory	1
pole,	1
both	1
hollowly	1
ringing	1
along	1
every	1
plank.	1
But	1
ere	1
he	1
entered	1
his	1
cabin,	1
light,	1
unnatural,	1
half-bantering,	1
yet	1
most	1
piteous	1
sound	1
was	1
heard.	1
Oh,	1
Pip!	1
thy	1
wretched	1
laugh,	1
thy	1
idle	1
but	1
unresting	1
eye;	1
all	1
thy	1
strange	1
mummeries	1
not	1
unmeaningly	1
blended	1
with	1
the	1
black	1
tragedy	1
of	1
the	1
melancholy	1
ship,	1
and	1
mocked	1
it!	1
CHAPTER	1
114	1
The	1
Gilder.	1
Penetrating	1
further	1
and	1
further	1
into	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
the	1
Japanese	1
cruising	1
ground,	1
the	1
Pequod	1
was	1
soon	1
all	1
astir	1
in	1
the	1
fishery.	1
Often,	1
in	1
mild,	1
pleasant	1
weather,	1
for	1
twelve,	1
fifteen,	1
eighteen,	1
and	1
twenty	1
hours	1
on	1
the	1
stretch,	1
they	1
were	1
engaged	1
in	1
the	1
boats,	1
steadily	1
pulling,	1
or	1
sailing,	1
or	1
paddling	1
after	1
the	1
whales,	1
or	1
for	1
an	1
interlude	1
of	1
sixty	1
or	1
seventy	1
minutes	1
calmly	1
awaiting	1
their	1
uprising;	1
though	1
with	1
but	1
small	1
success	1
for	1
their	1
pains.	1
At	1
such	1
times,	1
under	1
an	1
abated	1
sun;	1
afloat	1
all	1
day	1
upon	1
smooth,	1
slow	1
heaving	1
swells;	1
seated	1
in	1
his	1
boat,	1
light	1
as	1
a	1
birch	1
canoe;	1
and	1
so	1
sociably	1
mixing	1
with	1
the	1
soft	1
waves	1
themselves,	1
that	1
like	1
hearth-stone	1
cats	1
they	1
purr	1
against	1
the	1
gunwale;	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
times	1
of	1
dreamy	1
quietude,	1
when	1
beholding	1
the	1
tranquil	1
beauty	1
and	1
brilliancy	1
of	1
the	1
ocean's	1
skin,	1
one	1
forgets	1
the	1
tiger	1
heart	1
that	1
pants	1
beneath	1
it;	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
willingly	1
remember,	1
that	1
this	1
velvet	1
paw	1
but	1
conceals	1
a	1
remorseless	1
fang.	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
times,	1
when	1
in	1
his	1
whale-boat	1
the	1
rover	1
softly	1
feels	1
a	1
certain	1
filial,	1
confident,	1
land-like	1
feeling	1
towards	1
the	1
sea;	1
that	1
he	1
regards	1
it	1
as	1
so	1
much	1
flowery	1
earth;	1
and	1
the	1
distant	1
ship	1
revealing	1
only	1
the	1
tops	1
of	1
her	1
masts,	1
seems	1
struggling	1
forward,	1
not	1
through	1
high	1
rolling	1
waves,	1
but	1
through	1
the	1
tall	1
grass	1
of	1
a	1
rolling	1
prairie:	1
as	1
when	1
the	1
western	1
emigrants'	1
horses	1
only	1
show	1
their	1
erected	1
ears,	1
while	1
their	1
hidden	1
bodies	1
widely	1
wade	1
through	1
the	1
amazing	1
verdure.	1
The	1
long-drawn	1
virgin	1
vales;	1
the	1
mild	1
blue	1
hill-sides;	1
as	1
over	1
these	1
there	1
steals	1
the	1
hush,	1
the	1
hum;	1
you	1
almost	1
swear	1
that	1
play-wearied	1
children	1
lie	1
sleeping	1
in	1
these	1
solitudes,	1
in	1
some	1
glad	1
May-time,	1
when	1
the	1
flowers	1
of	1
the	1
woods	1
are	1
plucked.	1
And	1
all	1
this	1
mixes	1
with	1
your	1
most	1
mystic	1
mood;	1
so	1
that	1
fact	1
and	1
fancy,	1
half-way	1
meeting,	1
interpenetrate,	1
and	1
form	1
one	1
seamless	1
whole.	1
Nor	1
did	1
such	1
soothing	1
scenes,	1
however	1
temporary,	1
fail	1
of	1
at	1
least	1
as	1
temporary	1
an	1
effect	1
on	1
Ahab.	1
But	1
if	1
these	1
secret	1
golden	1
keys	1
did	1
seem	1
to	1
open	1
in	1
him	1
his	1
own	1
secret	1
golden	1
treasuries,	1
yet	1
did	1
his	1
breath	1
upon	1
them	1
prove	1
but	1
tarnishing.	1
Oh,	1
grassy	1
glades!	1
oh,	1
ever	1
vernal	1
endless	1
landscapes	1
in	1
the	1
soul;	1
in	1
ye,--though	1
long	1
parched	1
by	1
the	1
dead	1
drought	1
of	1
the	1
earthy	1
life,--in	1
ye,	1
men	1
yet	1
may	1
roll,	1
like	1
young	1
horses	1
in	1
new	1
morning	1
clover;	1
and	1
for	1
some	1
few	1
fleeting	1
moments,	1
feel	1
the	1
cool	1
dew	1
of	1
the	1
life	1
immortal	1
on	1
them.	1
Would	1
to	1
God	1
these	1
blessed	1
calms	1
would	1
last.	1
But	1
the	1
mingled,	1
mingling	1
threads	1
of	1
life	1
are	1
woven	1
by	1
warp	1
and	1
woof:	1
calms	1
crossed	1
by	1
storms,	1
a	1
storm	1
for	1
every	1
calm.	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
steady	1
unretracing	1
progress	1
in	1
this	1
life;	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
advance	1
through	1
fixed	1
gradations,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
one	1
pause:--through	1
infancy's	1
unconscious	1
spell,	1
boyhood's	1
thoughtless	1
faith,	1
adolescence'	1
doubt	1
(the	1
common	1
doom),	1
then	1
scepticism,	1
then	1
disbelief,	1
resting	1
at	1
last	1
in	1
manhood's	1
pondering	1
repose	1
of	1
If.	1
But	1
once	1
gone	1
through,	1
we	1
trace	1
the	1
round	1
again;	1
and	1
are	1
infants,	1
boys,	1
and	1
men,	1
and	1
Ifs	1
eternally.	1
Where	1
lies	1
the	1
final	1
harbor,	1
whence	1
we	1
unmoor	1
no	1
more?	1
In	1
what	1
rapt	1
ether	1
sails	1
the	1
world,	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
weariest	1
will	1
never	1
weary?	1
Where	1
is	1
the	1
foundling's	1
father	1
hidden?	1
Our	1
souls	1
are	1
like	1
those	1
orphans	1
whose	1
unwedded	1
mothers	1
die	1
in	1
bearing	1
them:	1
the	1
secret	1
of	1
our	1
paternity	1
lies	1
in	1
their	1
grave,	1
and	1
we	1
must	1
there	1
to	1
learn	1
it.	1
And	1
that	1
same	1
day,	1
too,	1
gazing	1
far	1
down	1
from	1
his	1
boat's	1
side	1
into	1
that	1
same	1
golden	1
sea,	1
Starbuck	1
lowly	1
murmured:--	1
"Loveliness	1
unfathomable,	1
as	1
ever	1
lover	1
saw	1
in	1
his	1
young	1
bride's	1
eye!--Tell	1
me	1
not	1
of	1
thy	1
teeth-tiered	1
sharks,	1
and	1
thy	1
kidnapping	1
cannibal	1
ways.	1
Let	1
faith	1
oust	1
fact;	1
let	1
fancy	1
oust	1
memory;	1
I	1
look	1
deep	1
down	1
and	1
do	1
believe."	1
And	1
Stubb,	1
fish-like,	1
with	1
sparkling	1
scales,	1
leaped	1
up	1
in	1
that	1
same	1
golden	1
light:--	1
"I	1
am	1
Stubb,	1
and	1
Stubb	1
has	1
his	1
history;	1
but	1
here	1
Stubb	1
takes	1
oaths	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
always	1
been	1
jolly!"	1
CHAPTER	1
115	1
The	1
Pequod	1
Meets	1
The	1
Bachelor.	1
And	1
jolly	1
enough	1
were	1
the	1
sights	1
and	1
the	1
sounds	1
that	1
came	1
bearing	1
down	1
before	1
the	1
wind,	1
some	1
few	1
weeks	1
after	1
Ahab's	1
harpoon	1
had	1
been	1
welded.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
Nantucket	1
ship,	1
the	1
Bachelor,	1
which	1
had	1
just	1
wedged	1
in	1
her	1
last	1
cask	1
of	1
oil,	1
and	1
bolted	1
down	1
her	1
bursting	1
hatches;	1
and	1
now,	1
in	1
glad	1
holiday	1
apparel,	1
was	1
joyously,	1
though	1
somewhat	1
vain-gloriously,	1
sailing	1
round	1
among	1
the	1
widely-separated	1
ships	1
on	1
the	1
ground,	1
previous	1
to	1
pointing	1
her	1
prow	1
for	1
home.	1
The	1
three	1
men	1
at	1
her	1
mast-head	1
wore	1
long	1
streamers	1
of	1
narrow	1
red	1
bunting	1
at	1
their	1
hats;	1
from	1
the	1
stern,	1
a	1
whale-boat	1
was	1
suspended,	1
bottom	1
down;	1
and	1
hanging	1
captive	1
from	1
the	1
bowsprit	1
was	1
seen	1
the	1
long	1
lower	1
jaw	1
of	1
the	1
last	1
whale	1
they	1
had	1
slain.	1
Signals,	1
ensigns,	1
and	1
jacks	1
of	1
all	1
colours	1
were	1
flying	1
from	1
her	1
rigging,	1
on	1
every	1
side.	1
Sideways	1
lashed	1
in	1
each	1
of	1
her	1
three	1
basketed	1
tops	1
were	1
two	1
barrels	1
of	1
sperm;	1
above	1
which,	1
in	1
her	1
top-mast	1
cross-trees,	1
you	1
saw	1
slender	1
breakers	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
precious	1
fluid;	1
and	1
nailed	1
to	1
her	1
main	1
truck	1
was	1
a	1
brazen	1
lamp.	1
As	1
was	1
afterwards	1
learned,	1
the	1
Bachelor	1
had	1
met	1
with	1
the	1
most	1
surprising	1
success;	1
all	1
the	1
more	1
wonderful,	1
for	1
that	1
while	1
cruising	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
seas	1
numerous	1
other	1
vessels	1
had	1
gone	1
entire	1
months	1
without	1
securing	1
a	1
single	1
fish.	1
Not	1
only	1
had	1
barrels	1
of	1
beef	1
and	1
bread	1
been	1
given	1
away	1
to	1
make	1
room	1
for	1
the	1
far	1
more	1
valuable	1
sperm,	1
but	1
additional	1
supplemental	1
casks	1
had	1
been	1
bartered	1
for,	1
from	1
the	1
ships	1
she	1
had	1
met;	1
and	1
these	1
were	1
stowed	1
along	1
the	1
deck,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
captain's	1
and	1
officers'	1
state-rooms.	1
Even	1
the	1
cabin	1
table	1
itself	1
had	1
been	1
knocked	1
into	1
kindling-wood;	1
and	1
the	1
cabin	1
mess	1
dined	1
off	1
the	1
broad	1
head	1
of	1
an	1
oil-butt,	1
lashed	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
floor	1
for	1
a	1
centrepiece.	1
In	1
the	1
forecastle,	1
the	1
sailors	1
had	1
actually	1
caulked	1
and	1
pitched	1
their	1
chests,	1
and	1
filled	1
them;	1
it	1
was	1
humorously	1
added,	1
that	1
the	1
cook	1
had	1
clapped	1
a	1
head	1
on	1
his	1
largest	1
boiler,	1
and	1
filled	1
it;	1
that	1
the	1
steward	1
had	1
plugged	1
his	1
spare	1
coffee-pot	1
and	1
filled	1
it;	1
that	1
the	1
harpooneers	1
had	1
headed	1
the	1
sockets	1
of	1
their	1
irons	1
and	1
filled	1
them;	1
that	1
indeed	1
everything	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
sperm,	1
except	1
the	1
captain's	1
pantaloons	1
pockets,	1
and	1
those	1
he	1
reserved	1
to	1
thrust	1
his	1
hands	1
into,	1
in	1
self-complacent	1
testimony	1
of	1
his	1
entire	1
satisfaction.	1
As	1
this	1
glad	1
ship	1
of	1
good	1
luck	1
bore	1
down	1
upon	1
the	1
moody	1
Pequod,	1
the	1
barbarian	1
sound	1
of	1
enormous	1
drums	1
came	1
from	1
her	1
forecastle;	1
and	1
drawing	1
still	1
nearer,	1
a	1
crowd	1
of	1
her	1
men	1
were	1
seen	1
standing	1
round	1
her	1
huge	1
try-pots,	1
which,	1
covered	1
with	1
the	1
parchment-like	1
POKE	1
or	1
stomach	1
skin	1
of	1
the	1
black	1
fish,	1
gave	1
forth	1
a	1
loud	1
roar	1
to	1
every	1
stroke	1
of	1
the	1
clenched	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
crew.	1
On	1
the	1
quarter-deck,	1
the	1
mates	1
and	1
harpooneers	1
were	1
dancing	1
with	1
the	1
olive-hued	1
girls	1
who	1
had	1
eloped	1
with	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
Polynesian	1
Isles;	1
while	1
suspended	1
in	1
an	1
ornamented	1
boat,	1
firmly	1
secured	1
aloft	1
between	1
the	1
foremast	1
and	1
mainmast,	1
three	1
Long	1
Island	1
negroes,	1
with	1
glittering	1
fiddle-bows	1
of	1
whale	1
ivory,	1
were	1
presiding	1
over	1
the	1
hilarious	1
jig.	1
Meanwhile,	1
others	1
of	1
the	1
ship's	1
company	1
were	1
tumultuously	1
busy	1
at	1
the	1
masonry	1
of	1
the	1
try-works,	1
from	1
which	1
the	1
huge	1
pots	1
had	1
been	1
removed.	1
You	1
would	1
have	1
almost	1
thought	1
they	1
were	1
pulling	1
down	1
the	1
cursed	1
Bastille,	1
such	1
wild	1
cries	1
they	1
raised,	1
as	1
the	1
now	1
useless	1
brick	1
and	1
mortar	1
were	1
being	1
hurled	1
into	1
the	1
sea.	1
Lord	1
and	1
master	1
over	1
all	1
this	1
scene,	1
the	1
captain	1
stood	1
erect	1
on	1
the	1
ship's	1
elevated	1
quarter-deck,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
whole	1
rejoicing	1
drama	1
was	1
full	1
before	1
him,	1
and	1
seemed	1
merely	1
contrived	1
for	1
his	1
own	1
individual	1
diversion.	1
And	1
Ahab,	1
he	1
too	1
was	1
standing	1
on	1
his	1
quarter-deck,	1
shaggy	1
and	1
black,	1
with	1
a	1
stubborn	1
gloom;	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
two	1
ships	1
crossed	1
each	1
other's	1
wakes--one	1
all	1
jubilations	1
for	1
things	1
passed,	1
the	1
other	1
all	1
forebodings	1
as	1
to	1
things	1
to	1
come--their	1
two	1
captains	1
in	1
themselves	1
impersonated	1
the	1
whole	1
striking	1
contrast	1
of	1
the	1
scene.	1
"Come	1
aboard,	1
come	1
aboard!"	1
cried	1
the	1
gay	1
Bachelor's	1
commander,	1
lifting	1
a	1
glass	1
and	1
a	1
bottle	1
in	1
the	1
air.	1
"Hast	1
seen	1
the	1
White	1
Whale?"	1
gritted	1
Ahab	1
in	1
reply.	1
"No;	1
only	1
heard	1
of	1
him;	1
but	1
don't	1
believe	1
in	1
him	1
at	1
all,"	1
said	1
the	1
other	1
good-humoredly.	1
"Come	1
aboard!"	1
"Thou	1
art	1
too	1
damned	1
jolly.	1
Sail	1
on.	1
Hast	1
lost	1
any	1
men?"	1
"Not	1
enough	1
to	1
speak	1
of--two	1
islanders,	1
that's	1
all;--but	1
come	1
aboard,	1
old	1
hearty,	1
come	1
along.	1
I'll	1
soon	1
take	1
that	1
black	1
from	1
your	1
brow.	1
Come	1
along,	1
will	1
ye	1
(merry's	1
the	1
play);	1
a	1
full	1
ship	1
and	1
homeward-bound."	1
"How	1
wondrous	1
familiar	1
is	1
a	1
fool!"	1
muttered	1
Ahab;	1
then	1
aloud,	1
"Thou	1
art	1
a	1
full	1
ship	1
and	1
homeward	1
bound,	1
thou	1
sayst;	1
well,	1
then,	1
call	1
me	1
an	1
empty	1
ship,	1
and	1
outward-bound.	1
So	1
go	1
thy	1
ways,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
mine.	1
Forward	1
there!	1
Set	1
all	1
sail,	1
and	1
keep	1
her	1
to	1
the	1
wind!"	1
And	1
thus,	1
while	1
the	1
one	1
ship	1
went	1
cheerily	1
before	1
the	1
breeze,	1
the	1
other	1
stubbornly	1
fought	1
against	1
it;	1
and	1
so	1
the	1
two	1
vessels	1
parted;	1
the	1
crew	1
of	1
the	1
Pequod	1
looking	1
with	1
grave,	1
lingering	1
glances	1
towards	1
the	1
receding	1
Bachelor;	1
but	1
the	1
Bachelor's	1
men	1
never	1
heeding	1
their	1
gaze	1
for	1
the	1
lively	1
revelry	1
they	1
were	1
in.	1
And	1
as	1
Ahab,	1
leaning	1
over	1
the	1
taffrail,	1
eyed	1
the	1
homewardbound	1
craft,	1
he	1
took	1
from	1
his	1
pocket	1
a	1
small	1
vial	1
of	1
sand,	1
and	1
then	1
looking	1
from	1
the	1
ship	1
to	1
the	1
vial,	1
seemed	1
thereby	1
bringing	1
two	1
remote	1
associations	1
together,	1
for	1
that	1
vial	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
Nantucket	1
soundings.	1
CHAPTER	1
116	1
The	1
Dying	1
Whale.	1
Not	1
seldom	1
in	1
this	1
life,	1
when,	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
side,	1
fortune's	1
favourites	1
sail	1
close	1
by	1
us,	1
we,	1
though	1
all	1
adroop	1
before,	1
catch	1
somewhat	1
of	1
the	1
rushing	1
breeze,	1
and	1
joyfully	1
feel	1
our	1
bagging	1
sails	1
fill	1
out.	1
So	1
seemed	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
Pequod.	1
For	1
next	1
day	1
after	1
encountering	1
the	1
gay	1
Bachelor,	1
whales	1
were	1
seen	1
and	1
four	1
were	1
slain;	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
by	1
Ahab.	1
It	1
was	1
far	1
down	1
the	1
afternoon;	1
and	1
when	1
all	1
the	1
spearings	1
of	1
the	1
crimson	1
fight	1
were	1
done:	1
and	1
floating	1
in	1
the	1
lovely	1
sunset	1
sea	1
and	1
sky,	1
sun	1
and	1
whale	1
both	1
stilly	1
died	1
together;	1
then,	1
such	1
a	1
sweetness	1
and	1
such	1
plaintiveness,	1
such	1
inwreathing	1
orisons	1
curled	1
up	1
in	1
that	1
rosy	1
air,	1
that	1
it	1
almost	1
seemed	1
as	1
if	1
far	1
over	1
from	1
the	1
deep	1
green	1
convent	1
valleys	1
of	1
the	1
Manilla	1
isles,	1
the	1
Spanish	1
land-breeze,	1
wantonly	1
turned	1
sailor,	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
sea,	1
freighted	1
with	1
these	1
vesper	1
hymns.	1
Soothed	1
again,	1
but	1
only	1
soothed	1
to	1
deeper	1
gloom,	1
Ahab,	1
who	1
had	1
sterned	1
off	1
from	1
the	1
whale,	1
sat	1
intently	1
watching	1
his	1
final	1
wanings	1
from	1
the	1
now	1
tranquil	1
boat.	1
For	1
that	1
strange	1
spectacle	1
observable	1
in	1
all	1
sperm	1
whales	1
dying--the	1
turning	1
sunwards	1
of	1
the	1
head,	1
and	1
so	1
expiring--that	1
strange	1
spectacle,	1
beheld	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
placid	1
evening,	1
somehow	1
to	1
Ahab	1
conveyed	1
a	1
wondrousness	1
unknown	1
before.	1
"He	1
turns	1
and	1
turns	1
him	1
to	1
it,--how	1
slowly,	1
but	1
how	1
steadfastly,	1
his	1
homage-rendering	1
and	1
invoking	1
brow,	1
with	1
his	1
last	1
dying	1
motions.	1
He	1
too	1
worships	1
fire;	1
most	1
faithful,	1
broad,	1
baronial	1
vassal	1
of	1
the	1
sun!--Oh	1
that	1
these	1
too-favouring	1
eyes	1
should	1
see	1
these	1
too-favouring	1
sights.	1
Look!	1
here,	1
far	1
water-locked;	1
beyond	1
all	1
hum	1
of	1
human	1
weal	1
or	1
woe;	1
in	1
these	1
most	1
candid	1
and	1
impartial	1
seas;	1
where	1
to	1
traditions	1
no	1
rocks	1
furnish	1
tablets;	1
where	1
for	1
long	1
Chinese	1
ages,	1
the	1
billows	1
have	1
still	1
rolled	1
on	1
speechless	1
and	1
unspoken	1
to,	1
as	1
stars	1
that	1
shine	1
upon	1
the	1
Niger's	1
unknown	1
source;	1
here,	1
too,	1
life	1
dies	1
sunwards	1
full	1
of	1
faith;	1
but	1
see!	1
no	1
sooner	1
dead,	1
than	1
death	1
whirls	1
round	1
the	1
corpse,	1
and	1
it	1
heads	1
some	1
other	1
way.	1
"Oh,	1
thou	1
dark	1
Hindoo	1
half	1
of	1
nature,	1
who	1
of	1
drowned	1
bones	1
hast	1
builded	1
thy	1
separate	1
throne	1
somewhere	1
in	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
these	1
unverdured	1
seas;	1
thou	1
art	1
an	1
infidel,	1
thou	1
queen,	1
and	1
too	1
truly	1
speakest	1
to	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
wide-slaughtering	1
Typhoon,	1
and	1
the	1
hushed	1
burial	1
of	1
its	1
after	1
calm.	1
Nor	1
has	1
this	1
thy	1
whale	1
sunwards	1
turned	1
his	1
dying	1
head,	1
and	1
then	1
gone	1
round	1
again,	1
without	1
a	1
lesson	1
to	1
me.	1
"Oh,	1
trebly	1
hooped	1
and	1
welded	1
hip	1
of	1
power!	1
Oh,	1
high	1
aspiring,	1
rainbowed	1
jet!--that	1
one	1
strivest,	1
this	1
one	1
jettest	1
all	1
in	1
vain!	1
In	1
vain,	1
oh	1
whale,	1
dost	1
thou	1
seek	1
intercedings	1
with	1
yon	1
all-quickening	1
sun,	1
that	1
only	1
calls	1
forth	1
life,	1
but	1
gives	1
it	1
not	1
again.	1
Yet	1
dost	1
thou,	1
darker	1
half,	1
rock	1
me	1
with	1
a	1
prouder,	1
if	1
a	1
darker	1
faith.	1
All	1
thy	1
unnamable	1
imminglings	1
float	1
beneath	1
me	1
here;	1
I	1
am	1
buoyed	1
by	1
breaths	1
of	1
once	1
living	1
things,	1
exhaled	1
as	1
air,	1
but	1
water	1
now.	1
"Then	1
hail,	1
for	1
ever	1
hail,	1
O	1
sea,	1
in	1
whose	1
eternal	1
tossings	1
the	1
wild	1
fowl	1
finds	1
his	1
only	1
rest.	1
Born	1
of	1
earth,	1
yet	1
suckled	1
by	1
the	1
sea;	1
though	1
hill	1
and	1
valley	1
mothered	1
me,	1
ye	1
billows	1
are	1
my	1
foster-brothers!"	1
CHAPTER	1
117	1
The	1
Whale	1
Watch.	1
The	1
four	1
whales	1
slain	1
that	1
evening	1
had	1
died	1
wide	1
apart;	1
one,	1
far	1
to	1
windward;	1
one,	1
less	1
distant,	1
to	1
leeward;	1
one	1
ahead;	1
one	1
astern.	1
These	1
last	1
three	1
were	1
brought	1
alongside	1
ere	1
nightfall;	1
but	1
the	1
windward	1
one	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
reached	1
till	1
morning;	1
and	1
the	1
boat	1
that	1
had	1
killed	1
it	1
lay	1
by	1
its	1
side	1
all	1
night;	1
and	1
that	1
boat	1
was	1
Ahab's.	1
The	1
waif-pole	1
was	1
thrust	1
upright	1
into	1
the	1
dead	1
whale's	1
spout-hole;	1
and	1
the	1
lantern	1
hanging	1
from	1
its	1
top,	1
cast	1
a	1
troubled	1
flickering	1
glare	1
upon	1
the	1
black,	1
glossy	1
back,	1
and	1
far	1
out	1
upon	1
the	1
midnight	1
waves,	1
which	1
gently	1
chafed	1
the	1
whale's	1
broad	1
flank,	1
like	1
soft	1
surf	1
upon	1
a	1
beach.	1
Ahab	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
boat's	1
crew	1
seemed	1
asleep	1
but	1
the	1
Parsee;	1
who	1
crouching	1
in	1
the	1
bow,	1
sat	1
watching	1
the	1
sharks,	1
that	1
spectrally	1
played	1
round	1
the	1
whale,	1
and	1
tapped	1
the	1
light	1
cedar	1
planks	1
with	1
their	1
tails.	1
A	1
sound	1
like	1
the	1
moaning	1
in	1
squadrons	1
over	1
Asphaltites	1
of	1
unforgiven	1
ghosts	1
of	1
Gomorrah,	1
ran	1
shuddering	1
through	1
the	1
air.	1
Started	1
from	1
his	1
slumbers,	1
Ahab,	1
face	1
to	1
face,	1
saw	1
the	1
Parsee;	1
and	1
hooped	1
round	1
by	1
the	1
gloom	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
they	1
seemed	1
the	1
last	1
men	1
in	1
a	1
flooded	1
world.	1
"I	1
have	1
dreamed	1
it	1
again,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"Of	1
the	1
hearses?	1
Have	1
I	1
not	1
said,	1
old	1
man,	1
that	1
neither	1
hearse	1
nor	1
coffin	1
can	1
be	1
thine?"	1
"And	1
who	1
are	1
hearsed	1
that	1
die	1
on	1
the	1
sea?"	1
"But	1
I	1
said,	1
old	1
man,	1
that	1
ere	1
thou	1
couldst	1
die	1
on	1
this	1
voyage,	1
two	1
hearses	1
must	1
verily	1
be	1
seen	1
by	1
thee	1
on	1
the	1
sea;	1
the	1
first	1
not	1
made	1
by	1
mortal	1
hands;	1
and	1
the	1
visible	1
wood	1
of	1
the	1
last	1
one	1
must	1
be	1
grown	1
in	1
America."	1
"Aye,	1
aye!	1
a	1
strange	1
sight	1
that,	1
Parsee:--a	1
hearse	1
and	1
its	1
plumes	1
floating	1
over	1
the	1
ocean	1
with	1
the	1
waves	1
for	1
the	1
pall-bearers.	1
Ha!	1
Such	1
a	1
sight	1
we	1
shall	1
not	1
soon	1
see."	1
"Believe	1
it	1
or	1
not,	1
thou	1
canst	1
not	1
die	1
till	1
it	1
be	1
seen,	1
old	1
man."	1
"And	1
what	1
was	1
that	1
saying	1
about	1
thyself?"	1
"Though	1
it	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
last,	1
I	1
shall	1
still	1
go	1
before	1
thee	1
thy	1
pilot."	1
"And	1
when	1
thou	1
art	1
so	1
gone	1
before--if	1
that	1
ever	1
befall--then	1
ere	1
I	1
can	1
follow,	1
thou	1
must	1
still	1
appear	1
to	1
me,	1
to	1
pilot	1
me	1
still?--Was	1
it	1
not	1
so?	1
Well,	1
then,	1
did	1
I	1
believe	1
all	1
ye	1
say,	1
oh	1
my	1
pilot!	1
I	1
have	1
here	1
two	1
pledges	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
yet	1
slay	1
Moby	1
Dick	1
and	1
survive	1
it."	1
"Take	1
another	1
pledge,	1
old	1
man,"	1
said	1
the	1
Parsee,	1
as	1
his	1
eyes	1
lighted	1
up	1
like	1
fire-flies	1
in	1
the	1
gloom--"Hemp	1
only	1
can	1
kill	1
thee."	1
"The	1
gallows,	1
ye	1
mean.--I	1
am	1
immortal	1
then,	1
on	1
land	1
and	1
on	1
sea,"	1
cried	1
Ahab,	1
with	1
a	1
laugh	1
of	1
derision;--"Immortal	1
on	1
land	1
and	1
on	1
sea!"	1
Both	1
were	1
silent	1
again,	1
as	1
one	1
man.	1
The	1
grey	1
dawn	1
came	1
on,	1
and	1
the	1
slumbering	1
crew	1
arose	1
from	1
the	1
boat's	1
bottom,	1
and	1
ere	1
noon	1
the	1
dead	1
whale	1
was	1
brought	1
to	1
the	1
ship.	1
CHAPTER	1
118	1
The	1
Quadrant.	1
The	1
season	1
for	1
the	1
Line	1
at	1
length	1
drew	1
near;	1
and	1
every	1
day	1
when	1
Ahab,	1
coming	1
from	1
his	1
cabin,	1
cast	1
his	1
eyes	1
aloft,	1
the	1
vigilant	1
helmsman	1
would	1
ostentatiously	1
handle	1
his	1
spokes,	1
and	1
the	1
eager	1
mariners	1
quickly	1
run	1
to	1
the	1
braces,	1
and	1
would	1
stand	1
there	1
with	1
all	1
their	1
eyes	1
centrally	1
fixed	1
on	1
the	1
nailed	1
doubloon;	1
impatient	1
for	1
the	1
order	1
to	1
point	1
the	1
ship's	1
prow	1
for	1
the	1
equator.	1
In	1
good	1
time	1
the	1
order	1
came.	1
It	1
was	1
hard	1
upon	1
high	1
noon;	1
and	1
Ahab,	1
seated	1
in	1
the	1
bows	1
of	1
his	1
high-hoisted	1
boat,	1
was	1
about	1
taking	1
his	1
wonted	1
daily	1
observation	1
of	1
the	1
sun	1
to	1
determine	1
his	1
latitude.	1
Now,	1
in	1
that	1
Japanese	1
sea,	1
the	1
days	1
in	1
summer	1
are	1
as	1
freshets	1
of	1
effulgences.	1
That	1
unblinkingly	1
vivid	1
Japanese	1
sun	1
seems	1
the	1
blazing	1
focus	1
of	1
the	1
glassy	1
ocean's	1
immeasurable	1
burning-glass.	1
The	1
sky	1
looks	1
lacquered;	1
clouds	1
there	1
are	1
none;	1
the	1
horizon	1
floats;	1
and	1
this	1
nakedness	1
of	1
unrelieved	1
radiance	1
is	1
as	1
the	1
insufferable	1
splendors	1
of	1
God's	1
throne.	1
Well	1
that	1
Ahab's	1
quadrant	1
was	1
furnished	1
with	1
coloured	1
glasses,	1
through	1
which	1
to	1
take	1
sight	1
of	1
that	1
solar	1
fire.	1
So,	1
swinging	1
his	1
seated	1
form	1
to	1
the	1
roll	1
of	1
the	1
ship,	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
astrological-looking	1
instrument	1
placed	1
to	1
his	1
eye,	1
he	1
remained	1
in	1
that	1
posture	1
for	1
some	1
moments	1
to	1
catch	1
the	1
precise	1
instant	1
when	1
the	1
sun	1
should	1
gain	1
its	1
precise	1
meridian.	1
Meantime	1
while	1
his	1
whole	1
attention	1
was	1
absorbed,	1
the	1
Parsee	1
was	1
kneeling	1
beneath	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
ship's	1
deck,	1
and	1
with	1
face	1
thrown	1
up	1
like	1
Ahab's,	1
was	1
eyeing	1
the	1
same	1
sun	1
with	1
him;	1
only	1
the	1
lids	1
of	1
his	1
eyes	1
half	1
hooded	1
their	1
orbs,	1
and	1
his	1
wild	1
face	1
was	1
subdued	1
to	1
an	1
earthly	1
passionlessness.	1
At	1
length	1
the	1
desired	1
observation	1
was	1
taken;	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
pencil	1
upon	1
his	1
ivory	1
leg,	1
Ahab	1
soon	1
calculated	1
what	1
his	1
latitude	1
must	1
be	1
at	1
that	1
precise	1
instant.	1
Then	1
falling	1
into	1
a	1
moment's	1
revery,	1
he	1
again	1
looked	1
up	1
towards	1
the	1
sun	1
and	1
murmured	1
to	1
himself:	1
"Thou	1
sea-mark!	1
thou	1
high	1
and	1
mighty	1
Pilot!	1
thou	1
tellest	1
me	1
truly	1
where	1
I	1
AM--but	1
canst	1
thou	1
cast	1
the	1
least	1
hint	1
where	1
I	1
SHALL	1
be?	1
Or	1
canst	1
thou	1
tell	1
where	1
some	1
other	1
thing	1
besides	1
me	1
is	1
this	1
moment	1
living?	1
Where	1
is	1
Moby	1
Dick?	1
This	1
instant	1
thou	1
must	1
be	1
eyeing	1
him.	1
These	1
eyes	1
of	1
mine	1
look	1
into	1
the	1
very	1
eye	1
that	1
is	1
even	1
now	1
beholding	1
him;	1
aye,	1
and	1
into	1
the	1
eye	1
that	1
is	1
even	1
now	1
equally	1
beholding	1
the	1
objects	1
on	1
the	1
unknown,	1
thither	1
side	1
of	1
thee,	1
thou	1
sun!"	1
Then	1
gazing	1
at	1
his	1
quadrant,	1
and	1
handling,	1
one	1
after	1
the	1
other,	1
its	1
numerous	1
cabalistical	1
contrivances,	1
he	1
pondered	1
again,	1
and	1
muttered:	1
"Foolish	1
toy!	1
babies'	1
plaything	1
of	1
haughty	1
Admirals,	1
and	1
Commodores,	1
and	1
Captains;	1
the	1
world	1
brags	1
of	1
thee,	1
of	1
thy	1
cunning	1
and	1
might;	1
but	1
what	1
after	1
all	1
canst	1
thou	1
do,	1
but	1
tell	1
the	1
poor,	1
pitiful	1
point,	1
where	1
thou	1
thyself	1
happenest	1
to	1
be	1
on	1
this	1
wide	1
planet,	1
and	1
the	1
hand	1
that	1
holds	1
thee:	1
no!	1
not	1
one	1
jot	1
more!	1
Thou	1
canst	1
not	1
tell	1
where	1
one	1
drop	1
of	1
water	1
or	1
one	1
grain	1
of	1
sand	1
will	1
be	1
to-morrow	1
noon;	1
and	1
yet	1
with	1
thy	1
impotence	1
thou	1
insultest	1
the	1
sun!	1
Science!	1
Curse	1
thee,	1
thou	1
vain	1
toy;	1
and	1
cursed	1
be	1
all	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
cast	1
man's	1
eyes	1
aloft	1
to	1
that	1
heaven,	1
whose	1
live	1
vividness	1
but	1
scorches	1
him,	1
as	1
these	1
old	1
eyes	1
are	1
even	1
now	1
scorched	1
with	1
thy	1
light,	1
O	1
sun!	1
Level	1
by	1
nature	1
to	1
this	1
earth's	1
horizon	1
are	1
the	1
glances	1
of	1
man's	1
eyes;	1
not	1
shot	1
from	1
the	1
crown	1
of	1
his	1
head,	1
as	1
if	1
God	1
had	1
meant	1
him	1
to	1
gaze	1
on	1
his	1
firmament.	1
Curse	1
thee,	1
thou	1
quadrant!"	1
dashing	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
deck,	1
"no	1
longer	1
will	1
I	1
guide	1
my	1
earthly	1
way	1
by	1
thee;	1
the	1
level	1
ship's	1
compass,	1
and	1
the	1
level	1
deadreckoning,	1
by	1
log	1
and	1
by	1
line;	1
THESE	1
shall	1
conduct	1
me,	1
and	1
show	1
me	1
my	1
place	1
on	1
the	1
sea.	1
Aye,"	1
lighting	1
from	1
the	1
boat	1
to	1
the	1
deck,	1
"thus	1
I	1
trample	1
on	1
thee,	1
thou	1
paltry	1
thing	1
that	1
feebly	1
pointest	1
on	1
high;	1
thus	1
I	1
split	1
and	1
destroy	1
thee!"	1
As	1
the	1
frantic	1
old	1
man	1
thus	1
spoke	1
and	1
thus	1
trampled	1
with	1
his	1
live	1
and	1
dead	1
feet,	1
a	1
sneering	1
triumph	1
that	1
seemed	1
meant	1
for	1
Ahab,	1
and	1
a	1
fatalistic	1
despair	1
that	1
seemed	1
meant	1
for	1
himself--these	1
passed	1
over	1
the	1
mute,	1
motionless	1
Parsee's	1
face.	1
Unobserved	1
he	1
rose	1
and	1
glided	1
away;	1
while,	1
awestruck	1
by	1
the	1
aspect	1
of	1
their	1
commander,	1
the	1
seamen	1
clustered	1
together	1
on	1
the	1
forecastle,	1
till	1
Ahab,	1
troubledly	1
pacing	1
the	1
deck,	1
shouted	1
out--"To	1
the	1
braces!	1
Up	1
helm!--square	1
in!"	1
In	1
an	1
instant	1
the	1
yards	1
swung	1
round;	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
ship	1
half-wheeled	1
upon	1
her	1
heel,	1
her	1
three	1
firm-seated	1
graceful	1
masts	1
erectly	1
poised	1
upon	1
her	1
long,	1
ribbed	1
hull,	1
seemed	1
as	1
the	1
three	1
Horatii	1
pirouetting	1
on	1
one	1
sufficient	1
steed.	1
Standing	1
between	1
the	1
knight-heads,	1
Starbuck	1
watched	1
the	1
Pequod's	1
tumultuous	1
way,	1
and	1
Ahab's	1
also,	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
lurching	1
along	1
the	1
deck.	1
"I	1
have	1
sat	1
before	1
the	1
dense	1
coal	1
fire	1
and	1
watched	1
it	1
all	1
aglow,	1
full	1
of	1
its	1
tormented	1
flaming	1
life;	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
it	1
wane	1
at	1
last,	1
down,	1
down,	1
to	1
dumbest	1
dust.	1
Old	1
man	1
of	1
oceans!	1
of	1
all	1
this	1
fiery	1
life	1
of	1
thine,	1
what	1
will	1
at	1
length	1
remain	1
but	1
one	1
little	1
heap	1
of	1
ashes!"	1
"Aye,"	1
cried	1
Stubb,	1
"but	1
sea-coal	1
ashes--mind	1
ye	1
that,	1
Mr.	1
Starbuck--sea-coal,	1
not	1
your	1
common	1
charcoal.	1
Well,	1
well;	1
I	1
heard	1
Ahab	1
mutter,	1
'Here	1
some	1
one	1
thrusts	1
these	1
cards	1
into	1
these	1
old	1
hands	1
of	1
mine;	1
swears	1
that	1
I	1
must	1
play	1
them,	1
and	1
no	1
others.'	1
And	1
damn	1
me,	1
Ahab,	1
but	1
thou	1
actest	1
right;	1
live	1
in	1
the	1
game,	1
and	1
die	1
in	1
it!"	1
CHAPTER	1
119	1
The	1
Candles.	1
Warmest	1
climes	1
but	1
nurse	1
the	1
cruellest	1
fangs:	1
the	1
tiger	1
of	1
Bengal	1
crouches	1
in	1
spiced	1
groves	1
of	1
ceaseless	1
verdure.	1
Skies	1
the	1
most	1
effulgent	1
but	1
basket	1
the	1
deadliest	1
thunders:	1
gorgeous	1
Cuba	1
knows	1
tornadoes	1
that	1
never	1
swept	1
tame	1
northern	1
lands.	1
So,	1
too,	1
it	1
is,	1
that	1
in	1
these	1
resplendent	1
Japanese	1
seas	1
the	1
mariner	1
encounters	1
the	1
direst	1
of	1
all	1
storms,	1
the	1
Typhoon.	1
It	1
will	1
sometimes	1
burst	1
from	1
out	1
that	1
cloudless	1
sky,	1
like	1
an	1
exploding	1
bomb	1
upon	1
a	1
dazed	1
and	1
sleepy	1
town.	1
Towards	1
evening	1
of	1
that	1
day,	1
the	1
Pequod	1
was	1
torn	1
of	1
her	1
canvas,	1
and	1
bare-poled	1
was	1
left	1
to	1
fight	1
a	1
Typhoon	1
which	1
had	1
struck	1
her	1
directly	1
ahead.	1
When	1
darkness	1
came	1
on,	1
sky	1
and	1
sea	1
roared	1
and	1
split	1
with	1
the	1
thunder,	1
and	1
blazed	1
with	1
the	1
lightning,	1
that	1
showed	1
the	1
disabled	1
masts	1
fluttering	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
with	1
the	1
rags	1
which	1
the	1
first	1
fury	1
of	1
the	1
tempest	1
had	1
left	1
for	1
its	1
after	1
sport.	1
Holding	1
by	1
a	1
shroud,	1
Starbuck	1
was	1
standing	1
on	1
the	1
quarter-deck;	1
at	1
every	1
flash	1
of	1
the	1
lightning	1
glancing	1
aloft,	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
additional	1
disaster	1
might	1
have	1
befallen	1
the	1
intricate	1
hamper	1
there;	1
while	1
Stubb	1
and	1
Flask	1
were	1
directing	1
the	1
men	1
in	1
the	1
higher	1
hoisting	1
and	1
firmer	1
lashing	1
of	1
the	1
boats.	1
But	1
all	1
their	1
pains	1
seemed	1
naught.	1
Though	1
lifted	1
to	1
the	1
very	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
cranes,	1
the	1
windward	1
quarter	1
boat	1
(Ahab's)	1
did	1
not	1
escape.	1
A	1
great	1
rolling	1
sea,	1
dashing	1
high	1
up	1
against	1
the	1
reeling	1
ship's	1
high	1
teetering	1
side,	1
stove	1
in	1
the	1
boat's	1
bottom	1
at	1
the	1
stern,	1
and	1
left	1
it	1
again,	1
all	1
dripping	1
through	1
like	1
a	1
sieve.	1
"Bad	1
work,	1
bad	1
work!	1
Mr.	1
Starbuck,"	1
said	1
Stubb,	1
regarding	1
the	1
wreck,	1
"but	1
the	1
sea	1
will	1
have	1
its	1
way.	1
Stubb,	1
for	1
one,	1
can't	1
fight	1
it.	1
You	1
see,	1
Mr.	1
Starbuck,	1
a	1
wave	1
has	1
such	1
a	1
great	1
long	1
start	1
before	1
it	1
leaps,	1
all	1
round	1
the	1
world	1
it	1
runs,	1
and	1
then	1
comes	1
the	1
spring!	1
But	1
as	1
for	1
me,	1
all	1
the	1
start	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
meet	1
it,	1
is	1
just	1
across	1
the	1
deck	1
here.	1
But	1
never	1
mind;	1
it's	1
all	1
in	1
fun:	1
so	1
the	1
old	1
song	1
says;"--(SINGS.)	1
Oh!	1
jolly	1
is	1
the	1
gale,	1
And	1
a	1
joker	1
is	1
the	1
whale,	1
A'	1
flourishin'	1
his	1
tail,--	1
Such	1
a	1
funny,	1
sporty,	1
gamy,	1
jesty,	1
joky,	1
hoky-poky	1
lad,	1
is	1
the	1
Ocean,	1
oh!	1
The	1
scud	1
all	1
a	1
flyin',	1
That's	1
his	1
flip	1
only	1
foamin';	1
When	1
he	1
stirs	1
in	1
the	1
spicin',--	1
Such	1
a	1
funny,	1
sporty,	1
gamy,	1
jesty,	1
joky,	1
hoky-poky	1

is	1
the	1

oh!	1

But	1
he	1
only	1
smacks	1
his	1

A	1

"Avast	1
Stubb,"	1
cried	1
Starbuck,	1
"let	1
the	1
Typhoon	1
sing,	1
and	1
strike	1
his	1
harp	1
here	1
in	1
our	1
rigging;	1
but	1
if	1
thou	1

thou	1
wilt	1

"But	1
I	1

not	1
a	1
brave	1
man;	1
never	1
said	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
brave	1
man;	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
coward;	1
and	1
I	1
sing	1
to	1
keep	1
up	1
my	1
spirits.	1
And	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
what	1
it	1
is,	1
Mr.	1
Starbuck,	1
there's	1
no	1
way	1
to	1
stop	1
my	1
singing	1
in	1
this	1
world	1
but	1
to	1
cut	1
my	1
throat.	1
And	1
when	1
that's	1
done,	1
ten	1
to	1
one	1
I	1
sing	1
ye	1
the	1
doxology	1
for	1
a	1
wind-up."	1
"Madman!	1
look	1
through	1
my	1
eyes	1
if	1
thou	1
hast	1
none	1
of	1
thine	1
own."	1
"What!	1
how	1
can	1
you	1
see	1
better	1
of	1
a	1
dark	1
night	1
than	1
anybody	1
else,	1
never	1
mind	1
how	1
foolish?"	1
"Here!"	1
cried	1
Starbuck,	1
seizing	1
Stubb	1
by	1
the	1
shoulder,	1
and	1
pointing	1
his	1
hand	1
towards	1
the	1
weather	1
bow,	1
"markest	1
thou	1
not	1
that	1
the	1
gale	1
comes	1
from	1
the	1
eastward,	1
the	1
very	1
course	1
Ahab	1
is	1
to	1
run	1
for	1
Moby	1
Dick?	1
the	1
very	1
course	1
he	1
swung	1
to	1
this	1
day	1
noon?	1
now	1
mark	1
his	1
boat	1
there;	1
where	1
is	1
that	1
stove?	1
In	1
the	1
stern-sheets,	1
man;	1
where	1
he	1
is	1
wont	1
to	1
stand--his	1
stand-point	1
is	1
stove,	1
man!	1
Now	1
jump	1
overboard,	1
and	1
sing	1
away,	1
if	1
thou	1
must!	1
"I	1
don't	1
half	1
understand	1
ye:	1
what's	1
in	1
the	1
wind?"	1
"Yes,	1
yes,	1
round	1
the	1
Cape	1
of	1
Good	1
Hope	1
is	1
the	1
shortest	1
way	1
to	1
Nantucket,"	1
soliloquized	1
Starbuck	1
suddenly,	1
heedless	1
of	1
Stubb's	1
question.	1
"The	1
gale	1
that	1
now	1
hammers	1
at	1
us	1
to	1
stave	1
us,	1
we	1
can	1
turn	1
it	1
into	1
a	1
fair	1
wind	1
that	1
will	1
drive	1
us	1
towards	1
home.	1
Yonder,	1
to	1
windward,	1
all	1
is	1
blackness	1
of	1
doom;	1
but	1
to	1
leeward,	1
homeward--I	1
see	1
it	1
lightens	1
up	1
there;	1
but	1
not	1
with	1
the	1
lightning."	1
At	1
that	1
moment	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
intervals	1
of	1
profound	1
darkness,	1
following	1
the	1
flashes,	1
a	1
voice	1
was	1
heard	1
at	1
his	1
side;	1
and	1
almost	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
instant	1
a	1
volley	1
of	1
thunder	1
peals	1
rolled	1
overhead.	1
"Who's	1
there?"	1
"Old	1
Thunder!"	1
said	1
Ahab,	1
groping	1
his	1
way	1
along	1
the	1
bulwarks	1
to	1
his	1
pivot-hole;	1
but	1
suddenly	1
finding	1
his	1
path	1
made	1
plain	1
to	1
him	1
by	1
elbowed	1
lances	1
of	1
fire.	1
Now,	1
as	1
the	1
lightning	1
rod	1
to	1
a	1
spire	1
on	1
shore	1
is	1
intended	1
to	1
carry	1
off	1
the	1
perilous	1
fluid	1
into	1
the	1
soil;	1
so	1
the	1
kindred	1
rod	1
which	1
at	1
sea	1
some	1
ships	1
carry	1
to	1
each	1
mast,	1
is	1
intended	1
to	1
conduct	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
water.	1
But	1
as	1
this	1
conductor	1
must	1
descend	1
to	1
considerable	1
depth,	1
that	1
its	1
end	1
may	1
avoid	1
all	1
contact	1
with	1
the	1
hull;	1
and	1
as	1
moreover,	1
if	1
kept	1
constantly	1
towing	1
there,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
liable	1
to	1
many	1
mishaps,	1
besides	1
interfering	1
not	1
a	1
little	1
with	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
rigging,	1
and	1
more	1
or	1
less	1
impeding	1
the	1
vessel's	1
way	1
in	1
the	1
water;	1
because	1
of	1
all	1
this,	1
the	1
lower	1
parts	1
of	1
a	1
ship's	1
lightning-rods	1
are	1
not	1
always	1
overboard;	1
but	1
are	1
generally	1
made	1
in	1
long	1
slender	1
links,	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
more	1
readily	1
hauled	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
chains	1
outside,	1
or	1
thrown	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
sea,	1
as	1
occasion	1
may	1
require.	1
"The	1
rods!	1
the	1
rods!"	1
cried	1
Starbuck	1
to	1
the	1
crew,	1
suddenly	1
admonished	1
to	1
vigilance	1
by	1
the	1
vivid	1
lightning	1
that	1
had	1
just	1
been	1
darting	1
flambeaux,	1
to	1
light	1
Ahab	1
to	1
his	1
post.	1
"Are	1
they	1
overboard?	1
drop	1
them	1
over,	1
fore	1
and	1
aft.	1
Quick!"	1
"Avast!"	1
cried	1
Ahab;	1
"let's	1
have	1
fair	1
play	1
here,	1
though	1
we	1
be	1
the	1
weaker	1
side.	1
Yet	1
I'll	1
contribute	1
to	1
raise	1
rods	1
on	1
the	1
Himmalehs	1
and	1
Andes,	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
may	1
be	1
secured;	1
but	1
out	1
on	1
privileges!	1
Let	1
them	1
be,	1
sir."	1
"Look	1
aloft!"	1
cried	1
Starbuck.	1
"The	1
corpusants!	1
the	1
corpusants!	1
All	1
the	1
yard-arms	1
were	1
tipped	1
with	1
a	1
pallid	1
fire;	1
and	1
touched	1
at	1
each	1
tri-pointed	1
lightning-rod-end	1
with	1
three	1
tapering	1
white	1
flames,	1
each	1
of	1
the	1
three	1
tall	1
masts	1
was	1
silently	1
burning	1
in	1
that	1
sulphurous	1
air,	1
like	1
three	1
gigantic	1
wax	1
tapers	1
before	1
an	1
altar.	1
"Blast	1
the	1
boat!	1
let	1
it	1
go!"	1
cried	1
Stubb	1
at	1
this	1
instant,	1
as	1
a	1
swashing	1
sea	1
heaved	1
up	1
under	1
his	1
own	1
little	1
craft,	1
so	1
that	1
its	1
gunwale	1
violently	1
jammed	1
his	1
hand,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
passing	1
a	1
lashing.	1
"Blast	1
it!"--but	1
slipping	1
backward	1
on	1
the	1
deck,	1
his	1
uplifted	1
eyes	1
caught	1
the	1
flames;	1
and	1
immediately	1
shifting	1
his	1
tone	1
he	1
cried--"The	1
corpusants	1
have	1
mercy	1
on	1
us	1
all!"	1
To	1
sailors,	1
oaths	1
are	1
household	1
words;	1
they	1
will	1
swear	1
in	1
the	1
trance	1
of	1
the	1
calm,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
teeth	1
of	1
the	1
tempest;	1
they	1
will	1
imprecate	1
curses	1
from	1
the	1
topsail-yard-arms,	1
when	1
most	1
they	1
teeter	1
over	1
to	1
a	1
seething	1
sea;	1
but	1
in	1
all	1
my	1
voyagings,	1
seldom	1
have	1
I	1
heard	1
a	1
common	1
oath	1
when	1
God's	1
burning	1
finger	1
has	1
been	1
laid	1
on	1
the	1
ship;	1
when	1
His	1
"Mene,	1
Mene,	1
Tekel	1
Upharsin"	1
has	1
been	1
woven	1
into	1
the	1
shrouds	1
and	1
the	1
cordage.	1
While	1
this	1
pallidness	1
was	1
burning	1
aloft,	1
few	1
words	1
were	1
heard	1
from	1
the	1
enchanted	1
crew;	1
who	1
in	1
one	1
thick	1
cluster	1
stood	1
on	1
the	1
forecastle,	1
all	1
their	1
eyes	1
gleaming	1
in	1
that	1
pale	1
phosphorescence,	1
like	1
a	1
far	1
away	1
constellation	1
of	1
stars.	1
Relieved	1
against	1
the	1
ghostly	1
light,	1
the	1
gigantic	1
jet	1
negro,	1
Daggoo,	1
loomed	1
up	1
to	1
thrice	1
his	1
real	1
stature,	1
and	1
seemed	1
the	1
black	1
cloud	1
from	1
which	1
the	1
thunder	1
had	1
come.	1
The	1
parted	1
mouth	1
of	1
Tashtego	1
revealed	1
his	1
shark-white	1
teeth,	1
which	1
strangely	1
gleamed	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
too	1
had	1
been	1
tipped	1
by	1
corpusants;	1
while	1
lit	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
preternatural	1
light,	1
Queequeg's	1
tattooing	1
burned	1
like	1
Satanic	1
blue	1
flames	1
on	1
his	1
body.	1
The	1
tableau	1
all	1
waned	1
at	1
last	1
with	1
the	1
pallidness	1
aloft;	1
and	1
once	1
more	1
the	1
Pequod	1
and	1
every	1
soul	1
on	1
her	1
decks	1
were	1
wrapped	1
in	1
a	1
pall.	1
A	1
moment	1
or	1
two	1
passed,	1
when	1
Starbuck,	1
going	1
forward,	1
pushed	1
against	1
some	1
one.	1
It	1
was	1
Stubb.	1
"What	1
thinkest	1
thou	1
now,	1
man;	1
I	1
heard	1
thy	1
cry;	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
same	1
in	1
the	1
song."	1
"No,	1
no,	1
it	1
wasn't;	1
I	1
said	1
the	1
corpusants	1
have	1
mercy	1
on	1
us	1
all;	1
and	1
I	1
hope	1
they	1
will,	1
still.	1
But	1
do	1
they	1
only	1
have	1
mercy	1
on	1
long	1
faces?--have	1
they	1
no	1
bowels	1
for	1
a	1
laugh?	1
And	1
look	1
ye,	1
Mr.	1
Starbuck--but	1
it's	1
too	1
dark	1
to	1
look.	1
Hear	1
me,	1
then:	1
I	1
take	1
that	1
mast-head	1
flame	1
we	1
saw	1
for	1
a	1
sign	1
of	1
good	1
luck;	1
for	1
those	1
masts	1
are	1
rooted	1
in	1
a	1
hold	1
that	1
is	1
going	1
to	1
be	1
chock	1
a'	1
block	1
with	1
sperm-oil,	1
d'ye	1
see;	1
and	1
so,	1
all	1
that	1
sperm	1
will	1
work	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
masts,	1
like	1
sap	1
in	1
a	1
tree.	1
Yes,	1
our	1
three	1
masts	1
will	1
yet	1
be	1
as	1
three	1
spermaceti	1
candles--that's	1
the	1
good	1
promise	1
we	1
saw."	1
At	1
that	1
moment	1
Starbuck	1
caught	1
sight	1
of	1
Stubb's	1
face	1
slowly	1
beginning	1
to	1
glimmer	1
into	1
sight.	1
Glancing	1
upwards,	1
he	1
cried:	1
"See!	1
see!"	1
and	1
once	1
more	1
the	1
high	1
tapering	1
flames	1
were	1
beheld	1
with	1
what	1
seemed	1
redoubled	1
supernaturalness	1
in	1
their	1
pallor.	1
"The	1
corpusants	1
have	1
mercy	1
on	1
us	1
all,"	1
cried	1
Stubb,	1
again.	1
At	1
the	1
base	1
of	1
the	1
mainmast,	1
full	1
beneath	1
the	1
doubloon	1
and	1
the	1
flame,	1
the	1
Parsee	1
was	1
kneeling	1
in	1
Ahab's	1
front,	1
but	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
bowed	1
away	1
from	1
him;	1
while	1
near	1
by,	1
from	1
the	1
arched	1
and	1
overhanging	1
rigging,	1
where	1
they	1
had	1
just	1
been	1
engaged	1
securing	1
a	1
spar,	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
seamen,	1
arrested	1
by	1
the	1
glare,	1
now	1
cohered	1
together,	1
and	1
hung	1
pendulous,	1
like	1
a	1
knot	1
of	1
numbed	1
wasps	1
from	1
a	1
drooping,	1
orchard	1
twig.	1
In	1
various	1
enchanted	1
attitudes,	1
like	1
the	1
standing,	1
or	1
stepping,	1
or	1
running	1
skeletons	1
in	1
Herculaneum,	1
others	1
remained	1
rooted	1
to	1
the	1
deck;	1
but	1
all	1
their	1
eyes	1
upcast.	1
"Aye,	1
aye,	1
men!"	1
cried	1
Ahab.	1
"Look	1
up	1
at	1
it;	1
mark	1
it	1
well;	1
the	1
white	1
flame	1
but	1
lights	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
White	1
Whale!	1
Hand	1
me	1
those	1
mainmast	1
links	1
there;	1
I	1
would	1
fain	1
feel	1
this	1
pulse,	1
and	1
let	1
mine	1
beat	1
against	1
it;	1
blood	1
against	1
fire!	1
So."	1
Then	1
turning--the	1
last	1
link	1
held	1
fast	1
in	1
his	1
left	1
hand,	1
he	1
put	1
his	1
foot	1
upon	1
the	1
Parsee;	1
and	1
with	1
fixed	1
upward	1
eye,	1
and	1
high-flung	1
right	1
arm,	1
he	1
stood	1
erect	1
before	1
the	1
lofty	1
tri-pointed	1
trinity	1
of	1
flames.	1
"Oh!	1
thou	1
clear	1
spirit	1
of	1
clear	1
fire,	1
whom	1
on	1
these	1
seas	1
I	1
as	1
Persian	1
once	1
did	1
worship,	1
till	1
in	1
the	1
sacramental	1
act	1
so	1
burned	1
by	1
thee,	1
that	1
to	1
this	1
hour	1
I	1
bear	1
the	1
scar;	1
I	1
now	1
know	1
thee,	1
thou	1
clear	1
spirit,	1
and	1
I	1
now	1
know	1
that	1
thy	1
right	1
worship	1
is	1
defiance.	1
To	1
neither	1
love	1
nor	1
reverence	1
wilt	1
thou	1
be	1
kind;	1
and	1
e'en	1
for	1
hate	1
thou	1
canst	1
but	1
kill;	1
and	1
all	1
are	1
killed.	1
No	1
fearless	1
fool	1
now	1
fronts	1
thee.	1
I	1
own	1
thy	1
speechless,	1
placeless	1
power;	1
but	1
to	1
the	1
last	1
gasp	1
of	1
my	1
earthquake	1
life	1
will	1
dispute	1
its	1
unconditional,	1
unintegral	1
mastery	1
in	1
me.	1
In	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
personified	1
impersonal,	1
a	1
personality	1
stands	1
here.	1
Though	1
but	1
a	1
point	1
at	1
best;	1
whencesoe'er	1
I	1
came;	1
wheresoe'er	1
I	1
go;	1
yet	1
while	1
I	1
earthly	1
live,	1
the	1
queenly	1
personality	1
lives	1
in	1
me,	1
and	1
feels	1
her	1
royal	1
rights.	1
But	1
war	1
is	1
pain,	1
and	1
hate	1
is	1
woe.	1
Come	1
in	1
thy	1
lowest	1
form	1
of	1
love,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
kneel	1
and	1
kiss	1
thee;	1
but	1
at	1
thy	1
highest,	1
come	1
as	1
mere	1
supernal	1
power;	1
and	1
though	1
thou	1
launchest	1
navies	1
of	1
full-freighted	1
worlds,	1
there's	1
that	1
in	1
here	1
that	1
still	1
remains	1
indifferent.	1
Oh,	1
thou	1
clear	1
spirit,	1
of	1
thy	1
fire	1
thou	1
madest	1
me,	1
and	1
like	1
a	1
true	1
child	1
of	1
fire,	1
I	1
breathe	1
it	1
back	1
to	1
thee."	1

"I	1

said	1
I	1
not	1
so?	1
Nor	1
was	1

on	1
some	1
stunning	1
ground.	1
Oh,	1
oh!	1
Yet	1
blindfold,	1
yet	1
will	1
I	1
talk	1
to	1
thee.	1
Light	1
though	1
thou	1
be,	1
thou	1
leapest	1
out	1
of	1
darkness;	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
darkness	1
leaping	1
out	1
of	1
light,	1
leaping	1
out	1
of	1
thee!	1
The	1
javelins	1
cease;	1
open	1
eyes;	1
see,	1
or	1
not?	1
There	1
burn	1
the	1
flames!	1
Oh,	1
thou	1
magnanimous!	1
now	1
I	1
do	1
glory	1
in	1
my	1
genealogy.	1
But	1
thou	1
art	1
but	1
my	1
fiery	1
father;	1
my	1
sweet	1
mother,	1
I	1
know	1
not.	1
Oh,	1
cruel!	1
what	1
hast	1
thou	1
done	1
with	1
her?	1
There	1
lies	1
my	1
puzzle;	1
but	1
thine	1
is	1
greater.	1
Thou	1
knowest	1
not	1
how	1
came	1
ye,	1
hence	1
callest	1
thyself	1
unbegotten;	1
certainly	1
knowest	1
not	1
thy	1
beginning,	1
hence	1
callest	1
thyself	1
unbegun.	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
of	1
me,	1
which	1
thou	1
knowest	1
not	1
of	1
thyself,	1
oh,	1
thou	1
omnipotent.	1
There	1
is	1
some	1
unsuffusing	1
thing	1
beyond	1
thee,	1
thou	1
clear	1
spirit,	1
to	1
whom	1
all	1
thy	1
eternity	1
is	1
but	1
time,	1
all	1
thy	1
creativeness	1
mechanical.	1
Through	1
thee,	1
thy	1
flaming	1
self,	1
my	1
scorched	1
eyes	1
do	1
dimly	1
see	1
it.	1
Oh,	1
thou	1
foundling	1
fire,	1
thou	1
hermit	1
immemorial,	1
thou	1
too	1
hast	1
thy	1
incommunicable	1
riddle,	1
thy	1
unparticipated	1
grief.	1
Here	1
again	1
with	1
haughty	1
agony,	1
I	1
read	1
my	1
sire.	1
Leap!	1
leap	1
up,	1
and	1
lick	1
the	1
sky!	1
I	1
leap	1
with	1
thee;	1
I	1
burn	1
with	1
thee;	1
would	1
fain	1
be	1
welded	1
with	1
thee;	1
defyingly	1
I	1
worship	1
thee!"	1
"The	1
boat!	1
the	1
boat!"	1
cried	1
Starbuck,	1
"look	1
at	1
thy	1
boat,	1
old	1
man!"	1
Ahab's	1
harpoon,	1
the	1
one	1
forged	1
at	1
Perth's	1
fire,	1
remained	1
firmly	1
lashed	1
in	1
its	1
conspicuous	1
crotch,	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
projected	1
beyond	1
his	1
whale-boat's	1
bow;	1
but	1
the	1
sea	1
that	1
had	1
stove	1
its	1
bottom	1
had	1
caused	1
the	1
loose	1
leather	1
sheath	1
to	1
drop	1
off;	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
keen	1
steel	1
barb	1
there	1
now	1
came	1
a	1
levelled	1
flame	1
of	1
pale,	1
forked	1
fire.	1
As	1
the	1
silent	1
harpoon	1
burned	1
there	1
like	1
a	1
serpent's	1
tongue,	1
Starbuck	1
grasped	1
Ahab	1
by	1
the	1
arm--"God,	1
God	1
is	1
against	1
thee,	1
old	1
man;	1
forbear!	1
'tis	1
an	1
ill	1
voyage!	1
ill	1
begun,	1
ill	1
continued;	1
let	1
me	1
square	1
the	1
yards,	1
while	1
we	1
may,	1
old	1
man,	1
and	1
make	1
a	1
fair	1
wind	1
of	1
it	1
homewards,	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
a	1
better	1
voyage	1
than	1
this."	1
Overhearing	1
Starbuck,	1
the	1
panic-stricken	1
crew	1
instantly	1
ran	1
to	1
the	1
braces--though	1
not	1
a	1
sail	1
was	1
left	1
aloft.	1
For	1
the	1
moment	1
all	1
the	1
aghast	1
mate's	1
thoughts	1
seemed	1
theirs;	1
they	1
raised	1
a	1
half	1
mutinous	1
cry.	1
But	1
dashing	1
the	1
rattling	1
lightning	1
links	1
to	1
the	1
deck,	1
and	1
snatching	1
the	1
burning	1
harpoon,	1
Ahab	1
waved	1
it	1
like	1
a	1
torch	1
among	1
them;	1
swearing	1
to	1
transfix	1
with	1
it	1
the	1
first	1
sailor	1
that	1
but	1
cast	1
loose	1
a	1
rope's	1
end.	1
Petrified	1
by	1
his	1
aspect,	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
shrinking	1
from	1
the	1
fiery	1
dart	1
that	1
he	1
held,	1
the	1
men	1
fell	1
back	1
in	1
dismay,	1
and	1
Ahab	1
again	1
spoke:--	1
"All	1
your	1
oaths	1
to	1
hunt	1
the	1
White	1
Whale	1
are	1
as	1
binding	1
as	1
mine;	1
and	1
heart,	1
soul,	1
and	1
body,	1
lungs	1
and	1
life,	1
old	1
Ahab	1
is	1
bound.	1
And	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
know	1
to	1
what	1
tune	1
this	1
heart	1
beats;	1
look	1
ye	1
here;	1
thus	1
I	1
blow	1
out	1
the	1
last	1
fear!"	1
And	1
with	1
one	1
blast	1
of	1
his	1
breath	1
he	1
extinguished	1
the	1
flame.	1
As	1
in	1
the	1
hurricane	1
that	1
sweeps	1
the	1
plain,	1
men	1
fly	1
the	1
neighborhood	1
of	1
some	1
lone,	1
gigantic	1
elm,	1
whose	1
very	1
height	1
and	1
strength	1
but	1
render	1
it	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
more	1
unsafe,	1
because	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
more	1
a	1
mark	1
for	1
thunderbolts;	1
so	1
at	1
those	1
last	1
words	1
of	1
Ahab's	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
mariners	1
did	1
run	1
from	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
terror	1
of	1
dismay.	1

We	1
must	1
send	1
down	1
the	1
main-top-sail	1
yard,	1
sir.	1
The	1
band	1
is	1
working	1
loose	1
and	1
the	1
lee	1
lift	1
is	1
half-stranded.	1
Shall	1
I	1
strike	1
it,	1
sir?"	1
"Strike	1
nothing;	1
lash	1
it.	1
If	1
I	1
had	1
sky-sail	1
poles,	1
I'd	1
sway	1
them	1
up	1
now."	1
"Sir!--in	1
God's	1
name!--sir?"	1
"Well."	1
"The	1
anchors	1
are	1
working,	1
sir.	1
Shall	1
I	1
get	1
them	1
inboard?"	1
"Strike	1
nothing,	1
and	1
stir	1
nothing,	1
but	1
lash	1
everything.	1
The	1
wind	1
rises,	1
but	1
it	1
has	1
not	1
got	1
up	1
to	1
my	1
table-lands	1
yet.	1
Quick,	1
and	1
see	1
to	1
it.--By	1
masts	1

keels!	1
he	1
takes	1
me	1
for	1
the	1
hunch-backed	1

of	1

Send	1
down	1

Shall	1
I	1
strike	1
that?	1
Oh,	1
none	1

cowards	1
send	1
down	1

in	1
tempest	1

What	1

e'en	1
take	1
it	1
for	1
sublime,	1
did	1
I	1
not	1

No,	1
Stubb;	1
you	1
may	1
pound	1
that	1
knot	1
there	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
you	1
please,	1
but	1
you	1
will	1
never	1
pound	1
into	1
me	1
what	1
you	1
were	1
just	1
now	1
saying.	1
And	1
how	1
long	1
ago	1
is	1
it	1
since	1
you	1
said	1
the	1
very	1
contrary?	1
Didn't	1
you	1
once	1
say	1
that	1
whatever	1
ship	1
Ahab	1
sails	1
in,	1
that	1
ship	1
should	1
pay	1
something	1
extra	1
on	1
its	1
insurance	1
policy,	1
just	1
as	1
though	1
it	1
were	1
loaded	1
with	1
powder	1
barrels	1
aft	1
and	1
boxes	1
of	1
lucifers	1
forward?	1
Stop,	1
now;	1
didn't	1
you	1
say	1
so?"	1
"Well,	1
suppose	1
I	1
did?	1
What	1
then?	1
I've	1
part	1
changed	1
my	1
flesh	1
since	1
that	1
time,	1
why	1
not	1
my	1
mind?	1
Besides,	1
supposing	1
we	1
ARE	1
loaded	1
with	1
powder	1
barrels	1
aft	1
and	1
lucifers	1
forward;	1
how	1
the	1
devil	1
could	1
the	1
lucifers	1
get	1
afire	1
in	1
this	1
drenching	1
spray	1
here?	1
Why,	1
my	1
little	1
man,	1
you	1
have	1
pretty	1
red	1
hair,	1
but	1
you	1
couldn't	1
get	1
afire	1
now.	1
Shake	1
yourself;	1
you're	1
Aquarius,	1
or	1
the	1
water-bearer,	1
Flask;	1
might	1
fill	1
pitchers	1
at	1
your	1
coat	1
collar.	1
Don't	1
you	1
see,	1
then,	1
that	1
for	1
these	1
extra	1
risks	1
the	1
Marine	1
Insurance	1
companies	1
have	1
extra	1
guarantees?	1
Here	1
are	1
hydrants,	1
Flask.	1
But	1
hark,	1
again,	1
and	1
I'll	1
answer	1
ye	1
the	1
other	1
thing.	1
First	1
take	1
your	1
leg	1
off	1
from	1
the	1
crown	1
of	1
the	1
anchor	1
here,	1
though,	1
so	1
I	1
can	1
pass	1
the	1
rope;	1
now	1
listen.	1
What's	1
the	1
mighty	1
difference	1
between	1
holding	1
a	1
mast's	1
lightning-rod	1
in	1
the	1
storm,	1
and	1
standing	1
close	1
by	1
a	1
mast	1
that	1
hasn't	1
got	1
any	1
lightning-rod	1
at	1
all	1
in	1
a	1
storm?	1
Don't	1
you	1
see,	1
you	1
timber-head,	1
that	1
no	1
harm	1
can	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
holder	1
of	1
the	1
rod,	1
unless	1
the	1
mast	1
is	1
first	1
struck?	1
What	1
are	1
you	1
talking	1
about,	1
then?	1
Not	1
one	1
ship	1
in	1
a	1
hundred	1
carries	1
rods,	1
and	1
Ahab,--aye,	1
man,	1
and	1
all	1
of	1
us,--were	1
in	1
no	1
more	1
danger	1
then,	1
in	1
my	1
poor	1
opinion,	1
than	1
all	1
the	1
crews	1
in	1
ten	1
thousand	1
ships	1
now	1
sailing	1
the	1
seas.	1
Why,	1
you	1
King-Post,	1
you,	1
I	1
suppose	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
every	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
go	1
about	1
with	1
a	1
small	1
lightning-rod	1
running	1
up	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
his	1
hat,	1
like	1
a	1
militia	1
officer's	1
skewered	1
feather,	1
and	1
trailing	1
behind	1
like	1
his	1
sash.	1
Why	1
don't	1
ye	1
be	1
sensible,	1
Flask?	1
it's	1
easy	1
to	1
be	1
sensible;	1
why	1
don't	1
ye,	1
then?	1
any	1
man	1
with	1
half	1
an	1
eye	1
can	1
be	1
sensible."	1
"I	1
don't	1
know	1
that,	1
Stubb.	1
You	1
sometimes	1
find	1
it	1
rather	1
hard."	1
"Yes,	1
when	1
a	1
fellow's	1
soaked	1
through,	1
it's	1
hard	1
to	1
be	1
sensible,	1
that's	1
a	1
fact.	1
And	1
I	1
am	1
about	1
drenched	1
with	1
this	1
spray.	1
Never	1
mind;	1
catch	1
the	1
turn	1
there,	1
and	1
pass	1
it.	1
Seems	1
to	1
me	1
we	1
are	1
lashing	1
down	1
these	1
anchors	1
now	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
never	1
going	1
to	1
be	1
used	1
again.	1
Tying	1
these	1
two	1
anchors	1
here,	1
Flask,	1
seems	1
like	1
tying	1
a	1
man's	1
hands	1
behind	1
him.	1
And	1
what	1
big	1
generous	1
hands	1
they	1
are,	1
to	1
be	1
sure.	1
These	1
are	1
your	1
iron	1
fists,	1
hey?	1
What	1
a	1
hold	1
they	1
have,	1
too!	1
I	1
wonder,	1
Flask,	1
whether	1
the	1
world	1
is	1
anchored	1
anywhere;	1
if	1
she	1
is,	1
she	1
swings	1
with	1
an	1
uncommon	1
long	1
cable,	1
though.	1
There,	1
hammer	1
that	1
knot	1
down,	1
and	1
we've	1
done.	1
So;	1
next	1
to	1
touching	1
land,	1
lighting	1
on	1
deck	1
is	1
the	1
most	1
satisfactory.	1
I	1
say,	1
just	1
wring	1
out	1
my	1
jacket	1
skirts,	1
will	1
ye?	1
Thank	1
ye.	1
They	1
laugh	1
at	1
long-togs	1
so,	1
Flask;	1
but	1
seems	1
to	1
me,	1
a	1
Long	1
tailed	1
coat	1
ought	1
always	1
to	1
be	1
worn	1
in	1
all	1
storms	1
afloat.	1
The	1
tails	1
tapering	1
down	1
that	1
way,	1
serve	1
to	1
carry	1
off	1
the	1
water,	1
d'ye	1
see.	1
Same	1
with	1
cocked	1
hats;	1
the	1
cocks	1
form	1
gable-end	1
eave-troughs,	1
Flask.	1
No	1
more	1
monkey-jackets	1
and	1
tarpaulins	1
for	1
me;	1
I	1
must	1
mount	1
a	1
swallow-tail,	1
and	1
drive	1
down	1
a	1
beaver;	1
so.	1
Halloa!	1
whew!	1
there	1
goes	1
my	1
tarpaulin	1
overboard;	1
Lord,	1
Lord,	1
that	1
the	1
winds	1
that	1
come	1
from	1
heaven	1
should	1
be	1
so	1
unmannerly!	1
This	1
is	1
a	1
nasty	1
night,	1
lad."	1

The	1
Musket.	1
During	1
the	1
most	1
violent	1
shocks	1
of	1
the	1
Typhoon,	1
the	1
man	1
at	1
the	1
Pequod's	1
jaw-bone	1
tiller	1
had	1
several	1
times	1
been	1
reelingly	1
hurled	1
to	1
the	1
deck	1
by	1
its	1
spasmodic	1
motions,	1
even	1
though	1
preventer	1
tackles	1
had	1
been	1
attached	1
to	1
it--for	1
they	1
were	1
slack--because	1
some	1
play	1
to	1
the	1
tiller	1
was	1
indispensable.	1
In	1
a	1
severe	1
gale	1
like	1
this,	1
while	1
the	1
ship	1
is	1
but	1
a	1
tossed	1
shuttlecock	1
to	1
the	1
blast,	1
it	1
is	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
uncommon	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
needles	1
in	1
the	1
compasses,	1
at	1
intervals,	1
go	1
round	1
and	1
round.	1
It	1
was	1
thus	1
with	1
the	1
Pequod's;	1
at	1
almost	1
every	1
shock	1
the	1
helmsman	1
had	1
not	1
failed	1
to	1
notice	1
the	1
whirling	1
velocity	1
with	1
which	1
they	1
revolved	1
upon	1
the	1
cards;	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
sight	1
that	1
hardly	1
anyone	1
can	1
behold	1
without	1
some	1
sort	1
of	1
unwonted	1
emotion.	1

hours	1
after	1
midnight,	1
the	1
Typhoon	1
abated	1
so	1
much,	1
that	1
through	1
the	1
strenuous	1
exertions	1
of	1
Starbuck	1
and	1
Stubb--one	1
engaged	1
forward	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
aft--the	1
shivered	1
remnants	1
of	1
the	1
jib	1
and	1
fore	1
and	1
main-top-sails	1
were	1
cut	1
adrift	1
from	1
the	1
spars,	1
and	1
went	1
eddying	1
away	1
to	1
leeward,	1
like	1
the	1
feathers	1
of	1
an	1
albatross,	1
which	1
sometimes	1
are	1
cast	1
to	1
the	1
winds	1
when	1
that	1
storm-tossed	1
bird	1
is	1
on	1
the	1
wing.	1
The	1
three	1
corresponding	1
new	1
sails	1
were	1
now	1
bent	1
and	1
reefed,	1
and	1
a	1
storm-trysail	1
was	1
set	1
further	1
aft;	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
ship	1
soon	1
went	1
through	1
the	1
water	1
with	1
some	1
precision	1
again;	1
and	1
the	1
course--for	1
the	1
present,	1
East-south-east--which	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
steer,	1
if	1
practicable,	1
was	1
once	1
more	1
given	1
to	1
the	1
helmsman.	1
For	1
during	1
the	1
violence	1
of	1
the	1
gale,	1
he	1
had	1
only	1
steered	1
according	1
to	1
its	1
vicissitudes.	1
But	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
now	1
bringing	1
the	1
ship	1
as	1
near	1
her	1
course	1
as	1
possible,	1
watching	1
the	1
compass	1
meanwhile,	1
lo!	1
a	1
good	1
sign!	1
the	1
wind	1
seemed	1
coming	1
round	1
astern;	1
aye,	1
the	1
foul	1
breeze	1
became	1
fair!	1
Instantly	1
the	1
yards	1
were	1
squared,	1
to	1
the	1
lively	1
song	1
of	1
"HO!	1
THE	1
FAIR	1
WIND!	1
OH-YE-HO,	1
CHEERLY	1
MEN!"	1
the	1
crew	1
singing	1
for	1
joy,	1
that	1
so	1
promising	1
an	1
event	1
should	1
so	1
soon	1
have	1
falsified	1
the	1
evil	1
portents	1
preceding	1
it.	1
In	1
compliance	1
with	1
the	1
standing	1
order	1
of	1
his	1
commander--to	1
report	1
immediately,	1
and	1
at	1
any	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
twenty-four	1
hours,	1
any	1
decided	1
change	1
in	1
the	1
affairs	1
of	1
the	1
deck,--Starbuck	1
had	1
no	1
sooner	1
trimmed	1
the	1
yards	1
to	1
the	1
breeze--however	1
reluctantly	1
and	1
gloomily,--than	1
he	1
mechanically	1
went	1
below	1
to	1
apprise	1
Captain	1
Ahab	1
of	1
the	1
circumstance.	1
Ere	1
knocking	1
at	1
his	1
state-room,	1
he	1
involuntarily	1
paused	1
before	1
it	1
a	1
moment.	1
The	1
cabin	1
lamp--taking	1
long	1
swings	1
this	1
way	1
and	1
that--was	1
burning	1
fitfully,	1
and	1
casting	1
fitful	1
shadows	1
upon	1
the	1
old	1
man's	1
bolted	1
door,--a	1
thin	1
one,	1
with	1
fixed	1
blinds	1
inserted,	1
in	1
place	1
of	1
upper	1
panels.	1
The	1
isolated	1
subterraneousness	1
of	1
the	1
cabin	1
made	1
a	1
certain	1
humming	1
silence	1
to	1
reign	1
there,	1
though	1
it	1
was	1
hooped	1
round	1
by	1
all	1
the	1
roar	1
of	1
the	1
elements.	1
The	1
loaded	1
muskets	1
in	1
the	1
rack	1
were	1
shiningly	1
revealed,	1
as	1
they	1
stood	1
upright	1
against	1
the	1
forward	1
bulkhead.	1
Starbuck	1
was	1
an	1
honest,	1
upright	1
man;	1
but	1
out	1
of	1
Starbuck's	1
heart,	1
at	1
that	1
instant	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
muskets,	1
there	1
strangely	1
evolved	1
an	1
evil	1
thought;	1
but	1
so	1
blent	1
with	1
its	1
neutral	1
or	1
good	1
accompaniments	1
that	1
for	1
the	1
instant	1
he	1
hardly	1
knew	1
it	1
for	1
itself.	1
"He	1
would	1
have	1
shot	1
me	1
once,"	1
he	1
murmured,	1
"yes,	1
there's	1
the	1
very	1
musket	1
that	1
he	1
pointed	1
at	1
me;--that	1
one	1
with	1
the	1
studded	1
stock;	1
let	1
me	1
touch	1
it--lift	1
it.	1
Strange,	1
that	1
I,	1
who	1
have	1
handled	1
so	1
many	1
deadly	1
lances,	1
strange,	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
shake	1
so	1
now.	1
Loaded?	1
I	1
must	1
see.	1
Aye,	1
aye;	1
and	1
powder	1
in	1
the	1
pan;--that's	1
not	1
good.	1
Best	1
spill	1
it?--wait.	1
I'll	1
cure	1
myself	1
of	1
this.	1
I'll	1
hold	1
the	1
musket	1
boldly	1
while	1
I	1
think.--I	1
come	1
to	1
report	1
a	1
fair	1
wind	1
to	1
him.	1
But	1
how	1
fair?	1
Fair	1
for	1
death	1
and	1
doom,--THAT'S	1
fair	1
for	1
Moby	1
Dick.	1
It's	1
a	1
fair	1
wind	1
that's	1
only	1
fair	1
for	1
that	1
accursed	1
fish.--The	1
very	1
tube	1
he	1
pointed	1
at	1
me!--the	1
very	1
one;	1
THIS	1
one--I	1
hold	1
it	1
here;	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
killed	1
me	1
with	1
the	1
very	1
thing	1
I	1
handle	1
now.--Aye	1
and	1
he	1
would	1
fain	1
kill	1
all	1
his	1
crew.	1
Does	1
he	1
not	1
say	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
strike	1
his	1
spars	1
to	1
any	1
gale?	1
Has	1
he	1
not	1
dashed	1
his	1
heavenly	1
quadrant?	1
and	1
in	1
these	1
same	1
perilous	1
seas,	1
gropes	1
he	1
not	1
his	1
way	1
by	1
mere	1
dead	1
reckoning	1
of	1
the	1
error-abounding	1
log?	1
and	1
in	1
this	1
very	1
Typhoon,	1
did	1
he	1
not	1
swear	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
no	1
lightning-rods?	1
But	1
shall	1
this	1
crazed	1
old	1
man	1
be	1
tamely	1
suffered	1
to	1
drag	1
a	1
whole	1
ship's	1
company	1
down	1
to	1
doom	1
with	1
him?--Yes,	1
it	1
would	1
make	1
him	1
the	1
wilful	1
murderer	1
of	1
thirty	1
men	1
and	1
more,	1
if	1
this	1
ship	1
come	1
to	1
any	1
deadly	1
harm;	1
and	1
come	1
to	1
deadly	1
harm,	1
my	1
soul	1
swears	1
this	1
ship	1
will,	1
if	1
Ahab	1
have	1
his	1
way.	1
If,	1
then,	1
he	1
were	1
this	1
instant--put	1
aside,	1
that	1
crime	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
his.	1
Ha!	1
is	1
he	1
muttering	1
in	1
his	1
sleep?	1
Yes,	1
just	1
there,--in	1
there,	1
he's	1
sleeping.	1
Sleeping?	1
aye,	1
but	1
still	1
alive,	1
and	1
soon	1
awake	1
again.	1
I	1
can't	1
withstand	1
thee,	1
then,	1
old	1
man.	1
Not	1
reasoning;	1
not	1
remonstrance;	1
not	1
entreaty	1
wilt	1
thou	1
hearken	1
to;	1
all	1
this	1
thou	1
scornest.	1
Flat	1
obedience	1
to	1
thy	1
own	1
flat	1
commands,	1
this	1
is	1
all	1
thou	1
breathest.	1
Aye,	1
and	1
say'st	1
the	1
men	1
have	1
vow'd	1
thy	1
vow;	1
say'st	1
all	1
of	1
us	1
are	1
Ahabs.	1
Great	1
God	1
forbid!--But	1
is	1
there	1
no	1
other	1
way?	1
no	1
lawful	1
way?--Make	1
him	1
a	1
prisoner	1
to	1
be	1
taken	1
home?	1
What!	1
hope	1
to	1
wrest	1
this	1
old	1
man's	1
living	1
power	1
from	1
his	1
own	1
living	1
hands?	1
Only	1
a	1
fool	1
would	1
try	1
it.	1
Say	1
he	1
were	1
pinioned	1
even;	1
knotted	1
all	1
over	1
with	1
ropes	1
and	1
hawsers;	1
chained	1
down	1
to	1
ring-bolts	1
on	1
this	1
cabin	1
floor;	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
more	1
hideous	1
than	1
a	1
caged	1
tiger,	1
then.	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
endure	1
the	1
sight;	1
could	1
not	1
possibly	1
fly	1
his	1
howlings;	1
all	1
comfort,	1
sleep	1
itself,	1
inestimable	1
reason	1
would	1
leave	1
me	1
on	1
the	1
long	1
intolerable	1
voyage.	1
What,	1
then,	1
remains?	1
The	1
land	1
is	1
hundreds	1
of	1
leagues	1
away,	1
and	1
locked	1
Japan	1
the	1
nearest.	1
I	1
stand	1
alone	1
here	1
upon	1
an	1
open	1
sea,	1
with	1
two	1
oceans	1
and	1
a	1
whole	1
continent	1
between	1
me	1
and	1
law.--Aye,	1
aye,	1
'tis	1
so.--Is	1
heaven	1
a	1
murderer	1
when	1
its	1
lightning	1
strikes	1
a	1
would-be	1
murderer	1
in	1
his	1
bed,	1
tindering	1
sheets	1
and	1
skin	1
together?--And	1
would	1
I	1
be	1
a	1
murderer,	1
then,	1
if"--and	1
slowly,	1
stealthily,	1
and	1
half	1
sideways	1
looking,	1
he	1
placed	1
the	1
loaded	1
musket's	1
end	1
against	1
the	1
door.	1
"On	1
this	1
level,	1
Ahab's	1
hammock	1
swings	1
within;	1
his	1
head	1
this	1
way.	1
A	1
touch,	1
and	1
Starbuck	1
may	1
survive	1
to	1
hug	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
child	1
again.--Oh	1
Mary!	1
Mary!--boy!	1
boy!	1
boy!--But	1
if	1
I	1
wake	1
thee	1
not	1
to	1
death,	1
old	1
man,	1
who	1
can	1
tell	1
to	1
what	1
unsounded	1
deeps	1
Starbuck's	1
body	1
this	1
day	1
week	1
may	1
sink,	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
crew!	1
Great	1
God,	1
where	1
art	1
Thou?	1
Shall	1
I?	1
shall	1
I?--The	1
wind	1
has	1
gone	1
down	1
and	1
shifted,	1
sir;	1
the	1
fore	1
and	1
main	1
topsails	1
are	1
reefed	1
and	1
set;	1
she	1
heads	1
her	1
course."	1
"Stern	1
all!	1
Oh	1
Moby	1
Dick,	1
I	1
clutch	1
thy	1
heart	1
at	1
last!"	1
Such	1
were	1
the	1
sounds	1
that	1
now	1
came	1
hurtling	1
from	1
out	1
the	1
old	1
man's	1
tormented	1
sleep,	1
as	1
if	1
Starbuck's	1
voice	1
had	1
caused	1
the	1
long	1
dumb	1
dream	1
to	1
speak.	1
The	1
yet	1
levelled	1
musket	1
shook	1
like	1
a	1
drunkard's	1
arm	1
against	1
the	1
panel;	1
Starbuck	1
seemed	1
wrestling	1
with	1
an	1
angel;	1
but	1
turning	1
from	1
the	1
door,	1
he	1
placed	1
the	1
death-tube	1
in	1
its	1
rack,	1
and	1
left	1
the	1
place.	1
"He's	1
too	1
sound	1
asleep,	1
Mr.	1
Stubb;	1
go	1
thou	1
down,	1
and	1
wake	1
him,	1
and	1
tell	1
him.	1
I	1
must	1
see	1
to	1
the	1
deck	1
here.	1
Thou	1
know'st	1
what	1
to	1
say."	1
CHAPTER	1
124	1
The	1
Needle.	1
Next	1
morning	1
the	1
not-yet-subsided	1
sea	1
rolled	1
in	1
long	1
slow	1
billows	1
of	1
mighty	1
bulk,	1
and	1
striving	1
in	1
the	1
Pequod's	1
gurgling	1
track,	1
pushed	1
her	1
on	1
like	1
giants'	1
palms	1
outspread.	1
The	1
strong,	1
unstaggering	1
breeze	1
abounded	1
so,	1
that	1
sky	1
and	1
air	1
seemed	1
vast	1
outbellying	1
sails;	1
the	1
whole	1
world	1
boomed	1
before	1
the	1
wind.	1
Muffled	1
in	1
the	1
full	1
morning	1
light,	1
the	1
invisible	1
sun	1
was	1
only	1
known	1
by	1
the	1
spread	1
intensity	1
of	1
his	1
place;	1
where	1
his	1
bayonet	1
rays	1
moved	1
on	1
in	1
stacks.	1
Emblazonings,	1
as	1
of	1
crowned	1
Babylonian	1
kings	1
and	1
queens,	1
reigned	1
over	1
everything.	1
The	1
sea	1
was	1
as	1
a	1
crucible	1
of	1
molten	1
gold,	1
that	1
bubblingly	1
leaps	1
with	1
light	1
and	1
heat.	1
Long	1
maintaining	1
an	1
enchanted	1
silence,	1
Ahab	1
stood	1
apart;	1
and	1
every	1
time	1
the	1
tetering	1
ship	1
loweringly	1
pitched	1
down	1
her	1
bowsprit,	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
eye	1
the	1
bright	1
sun's	1
rays	1
produced	1
ahead;	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
profoundly	1
settled	1
by	1
the	1
stern,	1
he	1
turned	1
behind,	1
and	1
saw	1
the	1
sun's	1
rearward	1
place,	1
and	1
how	1
the	1
same	1
yellow	1
rays	1
were	1
blending	1
with	1
his	1
undeviating	1
wake.	1
"Ha,	1
ha,	1
my	1
ship!	1
thou	1
mightest	1
well	1
be	1
taken	1
now	1
for	1
the	1
sea-chariot	1
of	1
the	1
sun.	1
Ho,	1
ho!	1
all	1
ye	1
nations	1
before	1
my	1
prow,	1
I	1
bring	1
the	1
sun	1
to	1
ye!	1
Yoke	1
on	1
the	1
further	1
billows;	1
hallo!	1
a	1
tandem,	1
I	1
drive	1
the	1
sea!"	1
But	1
suddenly	1
reined	1
back	1
by	1
some	1
counter	1
thought,	1
he	1
hurried	1
towards	1
the	1
helm,	1
huskily	1
demanding	1
how	1
the	1
ship	1
was	1
heading.	1
"East-sou-east,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
the	1
frightened	1
steersman.	1
"Thou	1
liest!"	1
smiting	1
him	1
with	1
his	1
clenched	1
fist.	1
"Heading	1
East	1
at	1
this	1
hour	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
the	1
sun	1
astern?"	1
Upon	1
this	1
every	1
soul	1
was	1
confounded;	1
for	1
the	1
phenomenon	1
just	1
then	1
observed	1
by	1
Ahab	1
had	1
unaccountably	1
escaped	1
every	1
one	1
else;	1
but	1
its	1
very	1
blinding	1
palpableness	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
cause.	1
Thrusting	1
his	1
head	1
half	1
way	1
into	1
the	1
binnacle,	1
Ahab	1
caught	1
one	1
glimpse	1
of	1
the	1
compasses;	1
his	1
uplifted	1
arm	1
slowly	1
fell;	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
he	1
almost	1
seemed	1
to	1
stagger.	1
Standing	1
behind	1
him	1
Starbuck	1
looked,	1
and	1
lo!	1
the	1
two	1
compasses	1
pointed	1
East,	1
and	1
the	1
Pequod	1
was	1
as	1
infallibly	1
going	1
West.	1
But	1
ere	1
the	1
first	1
wild	1
alarm	1
could	1
get	1
out	1
abroad	1
among	1
the	1
crew,	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
rigid	1
laugh	1
exclaimed,	1
"I	1
have	1
it!	1
It	1
has	1
happened	1
before.	1
Mr.	1
Starbuck,	1
last	1
night's	1
thunder	1
turned	1
our	1
compasses--that's	1
all.	1
Thou	1
hast	1
before	1
now	1
heard	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
thing,	1
I	1
take	1
it."	1
"Aye;	1
but	1
never	1
before	1
has	1
it	1
happened	1
to	1
me,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
the	1
pale	1
mate,	1
gloomily.	1
Here,	1
it	1
must	1
needs	1
be	1
said,	1
that	1
accidents	1
like	1
this	1
have	1
in	1
more	1
than	1
one	1
case	1
occurred	1
to	1
ships	1
in	1
violent	1
storms.	1
The	1
magnetic	1
energy,	1
as	1
developed	1
in	1
the	1
mariner's	1
needle,	1
is,	1
as	1
all	1
know,	1
essentially	1
one	1
with	1
the	1
electricity	1
beheld	1
in	1
heaven;	1
hence	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
much	1
marvelled	1
at,	1
that	1
such	1
things	1
should	1
be.	1
Instances	1
where	1
the	1
lightning	1
has	1
actually	1
struck	1
the	1
vessel,	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
smite	1
down	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
spars	1
and	1
rigging,	1
the	1
effect	1
upon	1
the	1
needle	1
has	1
at	1
times	1
been	1
still	1
more	1
fatal;	1
all	1
its	1
loadstone	1
virtue	1
being	1
annihilated,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
before	1
magnetic	1
steel	1
was	1
of	1
no	1
more	1
use	1
than	1
an	1
old	1
wife's	1
knitting	1
needle.	1
But	1
in	1
either	1
case,	1
the	1
needle	1
never	1
again,	1
of	1
itself,	1
recovers	1
the	1
original	1
virtue	1
thus	1
marred	1
or	1
lost;	1
and	1
if	1
the	1
binnacle	1
compasses	1
be	1
affected,	1
the	1
same	1
fate	1
reaches	1
all	1
the	1
others	1
that	1
may	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
ship;	1
even	1
were	1
the	1
lowermost	1
one	1
inserted	1
into	1
the	1
kelson.	1
Deliberately	1
standing	1
before	1
the	1
binnacle,	1
and	1
eyeing	1
the	1
transpointed	1
compasses,	1
the	1
old	1
man,	1
with	1
the	1
sharp	1
of	1
his	1
extended	1
hand,	1
now	1
took	1
the	1
precise	1
bearing	1
of	1
the	1
sun,	1
and	1
satisfied	1
that	1
the	1
needles	1
were	1
exactly	1
inverted,	1
shouted	1
out	1
his	1
orders	1
for	1
the	1
ship's	1
course	1
to	1
be	1
changed	1
accordingly.	1
The	1
yards	1
were	1
hard	1
up;	1
and	1
once	1
more	1
the	1
Pequod	1
thrust	1
her	1
undaunted	1
bows	1
into	1
the	1
opposing	1
wind,	1
for	1
the	1
supposed	1
fair	1
one	1
had	1
only	1
been	1
juggling	1
her.	1
Meanwhile,	1
whatever	1
were	1
his	1
own	1
secret	1
thoughts,	1
Starbuck	1
said	1
nothing,	1
but	1
quietly	1
he	1
issued	1
all	1
requisite	1
orders;	1
while	1
Stubb	1
and	1
Flask--who	1
in	1
some	1
small	1
degree	1
seemed	1
then	1
to	1
be	1
sharing	1
his	1
feelings--likewise	1
unmurmuringly	1
acquiesced.	1
As	1
for	1
the	1
men,	1
though	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
lowly	1
rumbled,	1
their	1
fear	1
of	1
Ahab	1
was	1
greater	1
than	1
their	1
fear	1
of	1
Fate.	1
But	1
as	1
ever	1
before,	1
the	1
pagan	1
harpooneers	1
remained	1
almost	1
wholly	1
unimpressed;	1
or	1
if	1
impressed,	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
with	1
a	1
certain	1
magnetism	1
shot	1
into	1
their	1
congenial	1
hearts	1
from	1
inflexible	1
Ahab's.	1
For	1
a	1
space	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
walked	1
the	1
deck	1
in	1
rolling	1
reveries.	1
But	1
chancing	1
to	1
slip	1
with	1
his	1
ivory	1
heel,	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
crushed	1
copper	1
sight-tubes	1
of	1
the	1
quadrant	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
dashed	1
to	1
the	1
deck.	1
"Thou	1
poor,	1
proud	1
heaven-gazer	1
and	1
sun's	1
pilot!	1
yesterday	1
I	1
wrecked	1
thee,	1
and	1
to-day	1
the	1
compasses	1
would	1
fain	1
have	1
wrecked	1
me.	1
So,	1
so.	1
But	1
Ahab	1
is	1
lord	1
over	1
the	1
level	1
loadstone	1
yet.	1
Mr.	1
Starbuck--a	1
lance	1
without	1
a	1
pole;	1
a	1
top-maul,	1
and	1
the	1
smallest	1
of	1
the	1
sail-maker's	1
needles.	1
Quick!"	1
Accessory,	1
perhaps,	1
to	1
the	1
impulse	1
dictating	1
the	1
thing	1
he	1
was	1
now	1
about	1
to	1
do,	1
were	1
certain	1
prudential	1
motives,	1
whose	1
object	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
to	1
revive	1
the	1
spirits	1
of	1
his	1
crew	1
by	1
a	1
stroke	1
of	1
his	1
subtile	1
skill,	1
in	1
a	1
matter	1
so	1
wondrous	1
as	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
inverted	1
compasses.	1
Besides,	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
well	1
knew	1
that	1
to	1
steer	1
by	1
transpointed	1
needles,	1
though	1
clumsily	1
practicable,	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
thing	1
to	1
be	1
passed	1
over	1
by	1
superstitious	1
sailors,	1
without	1
some	1
shudderings	1
and	1
evil	1
portents.	1
"Men,"	1
said	1
he,	1
steadily	1
turning	1
upon	1
the	1
crew,	1
as	1
the	1
mate	1
handed	1
him	1
the	1
things	1
he	1
had	1
demanded,	1
"my	1
men,	1
the	1
thunder	1
turned	1
old	1
Ahab's	1
needles;	1
but	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
bit	1
of	1
steel	1
Ahab	1
can	1
make	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
own,	1
that	1
will	1
point	1
as	1
true	1
as	1
any."	1
Abashed	1
glances	1
of	1
servile	1
wonder	1
were	1
exchanged	1
by	1
the	1
sailors,	1
as	1
this	1
was	1
said;	1
and	1
with	1
fascinated	1
eyes	1
they	1
awaited	1
whatever	1
magic	1
might	1
follow.	1
But	1
Starbuck	1
looked	1
away.	1
With	1
a	1
blow	1
from	1
the	1
top-maul	1
Ahab	1
knocked	1
off	1
the	1
steel	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
lance,	1
and	1
then	1
handing	1
to	1
the	1
mate	1
the	1
long	1
iron	1
rod	1
remaining,	1
bade	1
him	1
hold	1
it	1
upright,	1
without	1
its	1
touching	1
the	1
deck.	1
Then,	1
with	1
the	1
maul,	1
after	1
repeatedly	1
smiting	1
the	1
upper	1
end	1
of	1
this	1
iron	1
rod,	1
he	1
placed	1
the	1
blunted	1
needle	1
endwise	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
less	1
strongly	1
hammered	1
that,	1
several	1
times,	1
the	1
mate	1
still	1
holding	1
the	1
rod	1
as	1
before.	1
Then	1
going	1
through	1
some	1
small	1
strange	1
motions	1
with	1
it--whether	1
indispensable	1
to	1
the	1
magnetizing	1
of	1
the	1
steel,	1
or	1
merely	1
intended	1
to	1
augment	1
the	1
awe	1
of	1
the	1
crew,	1
is	1
uncertain--he	1
called	1
for	1
linen	1
thread;	1
and	1
moving	1
to	1
the	1
binnacle,	1
slipped	1
out	1
the	1
two	1
reversed	1
needles	1
there,	1
and	1
horizontally	1
suspended	1
the	1
sail-needle	1
by	1
its	1
middle,	1
over	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
compass-cards.	1
At	1
first,	1
the	1
steel	1
went	1
round	1
and	1
round,	1
quivering	1
and	1
vibrating	1
at	1
either	1
end;	1
but	1
at	1
last	1
it	1
settled	1
to	1
its	1
place,	1
when	1
Ahab,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
intently	1
watching	1
for	1
this	1
result,	1
stepped	1
frankly	1
back	1
from	1
the	1
binnacle,	1
and	1
pointing	1
his	1
stretched	1
arm	1
towards	1
it,	1
exclaimed,--"Look	1
ye,	1
for	1
yourselves,	1
if	1
Ahab	1
be	1
not	1
lord	1
of	1
the	1
level	1
loadstone!	1
The	1
sun	1
is	1
East,	1
and	1
that	1
compass	1
swears	1
it!"	1
One	1
after	1
another	1
they	1
peered	1
in,	1
for	1
nothing	1
but	1
their	1
own	1
eyes	1
could	1
persuade	1
such	1
ignorance	1
as	1
theirs,	1
and	1
one	1
after	1
another	1
they	1
slunk	1
away.	1
In	1
his	1
fiery	1
eyes	1
of	1
scorn	1
and	1
triumph,	1
you	1
then	1
saw	1
Ahab	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
fatal	1
pride.	1
CHAPTER	1
125	1
The	1
Log	1
and	1
Line.	1
While	1
now	1
the	1
fated	1
Pequod	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
long	1
afloat	1
this	1
voyage,	1
the	1
log	1
and	1
line	1
had	1
but	1
very	1
seldom	1
been	1
in	1
use.	1
Owing	1
to	1
a	1
confident	1
reliance	1
upon	1
other	1
means	1
of	1
determining	1
the	1
vessel's	1
place,	1
some	1
merchantmen,	1
and	1
many	1
whalemen,	1
especially	1
when	1
cruising,	1
wholly	1
neglect	1
to	1
heave	1
the	1
log;	1
though	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
and	1
frequently	1
more	1
for	1
form's	1
sake	1
than	1
anything	1
else,	1
regularly	1
putting	1
down	1
upon	1
the	1
customary	1
slate	1
the	1
course	1
steered	1
by	1
the	1
ship,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
presumed	1
average	1
rate	1
of	1
progression	1
every	1
hour.	1
It	1
had	1
been	1
thus	1
with	1
the	1
Pequod.	1
The	1
wooden	1
reel	1
and	1
angular	1
log	1
attached	1
hung,	1
long	1
untouched,	1
just	1
beneath	1
the	1
railing	1
of	1
the	1
after	1
bulwarks.	1
Rains	1
and	1
spray	1
had	1
damped	1
it;	1
sun	1
and	1
wind	1
had	1
warped	1
it;	1
all	1
the	1
elements	1
had	1
combined	1
to	1
rot	1
a	1
thing	1
that	1
hung	1
so	1
idly.	1
But	1
heedless	1
of	1
all	1
this,	1
his	1
mood	1
seized	1
Ahab,	1
as	1
he	1
happened	1
to	1
glance	1
upon	1
the	1
reel,	1
not	1
many	1
hours	1
after	1
the	1
magnet	1
scene,	1
and	1
he	1
remembered	1
how	1
his	1
quadrant	1
was	1
no	1
more,	1
and	1
recalled	1
his	1
frantic	1
oath	1
about	1
the	1
level	1
log	1
and	1
line.	1
The	1
ship	1
was	1
sailing	1
plungingly;	1
astern	1
the	1
billows	1
rolled	1
in	1
riots.	1
"Forward,	1
there!	1
Heave	1
the	1
log!"	1
Two	1
seamen	1
came.	1
The	1
golden-hued	1
Tahitian	1
and	1
the	1
grizzly	1
Manxman.	1
"Take	1
the	1
reel,	1
one	1
of	1
ye,	1
I'll	1
heave."	1
They	1
went	1
towards	1
the	1
extreme	1
stern,	1
on	1
the	1
ship's	1
lee	1
side,	1
where	1
the	1
deck,	1
with	1
the	1
oblique	1
energy	1
of	1
the	1
wind,	1
was	1
now	1
almost	1
dipping	1
into	1
the	1
creamy,	1
sidelong-rushing	1
sea.	1
The	1
Manxman	1
took	1
the	1
reel,	1
and	1
holding	1
it	1
high	1
up,	1
by	1
the	1
projecting	1
handle-ends	1
of	1
the	1
spindle,	1
round	1
which	1
the	1
spool	1
of	1
line	1
revolved,	1
so	1
stood	1
with	1
the	1
angular	1
log	1
hanging	1
downwards,	1
till	1
Ahab	1
advanced	1
to	1
him.	1
Ahab	1
stood	1
before	1
him,	1
and	1
was	1
lightly	1
unwinding	1
some	1
thirty	1
or	1
forty	1
turns	1
to	1
form	1
a	1
preliminary	1
hand-coil	1
to	1
toss	1
overboard,	1
when	1
the	1
old	1
Manxman,	1
who	1
was	1
intently	1
eyeing	1
both	1
him	1
and	1
the	1
line,	1
made	1
bold	1
to	1
speak.	1
"Sir,	1
I	1
mistrust	1
it;	1
this	1
line	1
looks	1
far	1
gone,	1
long	1
heat	1
and	1
wet	1
have	1
spoiled	1
it."	1
"'Twill	1
hold,	1
old	1
gentleman.	1
Long	1
heat	1
and	1
wet,	1
have	1
they	1
spoiled	1
thee?	1
Thou	1
seem'st	1
to	1
hold.	1
Or,	1
truer	1
perhaps,	1
life	1
holds	1
thee;	1
not	1
thou	1
it."	1
"I	1
hold	1
the	1
spool,	1
sir.	1
But	1
just	1
as	1
my	1
captain	1
says.	1
With	1
these	1
grey	1
hairs	1
of	1
mine	1
'tis	1
not	1
worth	1
while	1
disputing,	1
'specially	1
with	1
a	1
superior,	1
who'll	1
ne'er	1
confess."	1
"What's	1
that?	1
There	1
now's	1
a	1
patched	1
professor	1
in	1
Queen	1
Nature's	1
granite-founded	1
College;	1
but	1
methinks	1
he's	1
too	1
subservient.	1
Where	1
wert	1
thou	1
born?"	1
"In	1
the	1
little	1
rocky	1
Isle	1
of	1
Man,	1
sir."	1
"Excellent!	1
Thou'st	1
hit	1
the	1
world	1
by	1
that."	1
"I	1
know	1
not,	1
sir,	1
but	1
I	1
was	1
born	1
there."	1
"In	1
the	1
Isle	1
of	1
Man,	1
hey?	1
Well,	1
the	1
other	1
way,	1
it's	1
good.	1
Here's	1
a	1
man	1
from	1
Man;	1
a	1
man	1
born	1
in	1
once	1
independent	1
Man,	1
and	1
now	1
unmanned	1
of	1
Man;	1
which	1
is	1
sucked	1
in--by	1
what?	1
Up	1
with	1
the	1
reel!	1
The	1
dead,	1
blind	1
wall	1
butts	1
all	1
inquiring	1
heads	1
at	1
last.	1
Up	1
with	1
it!	1
So."	1
The	1
log	1
was	1
heaved.	1
The	1
loose	1
coils	1
rapidly	1
straightened	1
out	1
in	1
a	1
long	1
dragging	1
line	1
astern,	1
and	1
then,	1
instantly,	1
the	1
reel	1
began	1
to	1
whirl.	1
In	1
turn,	1
jerkingly	1
raised	1
and	1
lowered	1
by	1
the	1
rolling	1
billows,	1
the	1
towing	1
resistance	1
of	1
the	1
log	1
caused	1
the	1
old	1
reelman	1
to	1
stagger	1
strangely.	1
"Hold	1
hard!"	1
Snap!	1
the	1
overstrained	1
line	1
sagged	1
down	1
in	1
one	1
long	1
festoon;	1
the	1
tugging	1
log	1
was	1
gone.	1
"I	1
crush	1
the	1
quadrant,	1
the	1
thunder	1
turns	1
the	1
needles,	1
and	1
now	1
the	1
mad	1
sea	1
parts	1
the	1
log-line.	1
But	1
Ahab	1
can	1
mend	1
all.	1
Haul	1
in	1
here,	1
Tahitian;	1
reel	1
up,	1
Manxman.	1
And	1
look	1
ye,	1
let	1
the	1
carpenter	1
make	1
another	1
log,	1
and	1
mend	1
thou	1
the	1
line.	1
See	1
to	1
it."	1
"There	1
he	1
goes	1
now;	1
to	1
him	1
nothing's	1
happened;	1
but	1
to	1
me,	1
the	1
skewer	1
seems	1
loosening	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
Haul	1
in,	1
haul	1
in,	1
Tahitian!	1
These	1
lines	1
run	1
whole,	1
and	1
whirling	1
out:	1
come	1
in	1
broken,	1
and	1
dragging	1
slow.	1
Ha,	1
Pip?	1
come	1
to	1
help;	1
eh,	1
Pip?"	1
"Pip?	1
whom	1
call	1
ye	1
Pip?	1
Pip	1
jumped	1
from	1
the	1
whale-boat.	1
Pip's	1
missing.	1
Let's	1
see	1
now	1
if	1
ye	1
haven't	1
fished	1
him	1
up	1
here,	1
fisherman.	1
It	1
drags	1
hard;	1
I	1
guess	1
he's	1
holding	1
on.	1
Jerk	1
him,	1
Tahiti!	1
Jerk	1
him	1
off;	1
we	1
haul	1
in	1
no	1
cowards	1
here.	1
Ho!	1
there's	1
his	1
arm	1
just	1
breaking	1
water.	1
A	1
hatchet!	1
a	1
hatchet!	1
cut	1
it	1
off--we	1
haul	1
in	1
no	1
cowards	1
here.	1
Captain	1
Ahab!	1
sir,	1
sir!	1
here's	1
Pip,	1
trying	1
to	1
get	1
on	1
board	1
again."	1
"Peace,	1
thou	1
crazy	1
loon,"	1
cried	1
the	1
Manxman,	1
seizing	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
arm.	1
"Away	1
from	1
the	1
quarter-deck!"	1
"The	1
greater	1
idiot	1
ever	1
scolds	1
the	1
lesser,"	1
muttered	1
Ahab,	1
advancing.	1
"Hands	1
off	1
from	1
that	1
holiness!	1
Where	1
sayest	1
thou	1
Pip	1
was,	1
boy?	1
"Astern	1
there,	1
sir,	1
astern!	1
Lo!	1
lo!"	1
"And	1
who	1
art	1
thou,	1
boy?	1
I	1
see	1
not	1
my	1
reflection	1
in	1
the	1
vacant	1
pupils	1
of	1
thy	1
eyes.	1
Oh	1
God!	1
that	1
man	1
should	1
be	1
a	1
thing	1
for	1
immortal	1
souls	1
to	1
sieve	1
through!	1
Who	1
art	1
thou,	1
boy?"	1
"Bell-boy,	1
sir;	1
ship's-crier;	1
ding,	1
dong,	1
ding!	1
Pip!	1
Pip!	1
Pip!	1
One	1
hundred	1
pounds	1
of	1
clay	1
reward	1
for	1
Pip;	1
five	1
feet	1
high--looks	1
cowardly--quickest	1
known	1
by	1
that!	1
Ding,	1
dong,	1
ding!	1
Who's	1
seen	1
Pip	1
the	1
coward?"	1
"There	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
hearts	1
above	1
the	1
snow-line.	1
Oh,	1
ye	1
frozen	1
heavens!	1
look	1
down	1
here.	1
Ye	1
did	1
beget	1
this	1
luckless	1
child,	1
and	1
have	1
abandoned	1
him,	1
ye	1
creative	1
libertines.	1
Here,	1
boy;	1
Ahab's	1
cabin	1
shall	1
be	1
Pip's	1
home	1
henceforth,	1
while	1
Ahab	1
lives.	1
Thou	1
touchest	1
my	1
inmost	1
centre,	1
boy;	1
thou	1
art	1
tied	1
to	1
me	1
by	1
cords	1
woven	1
of	1
my	1
heart-strings.	1
Come,	1
let's	1
down."	1
"What's	1
this?	1
here's	1
velvet	1
shark-skin,"	1
intently	1
gazing	1
at	1
Ahab's	1
hand,	1
and	1
feeling	1
it.	1
"Ah,	1
now,	1
had	1
poor	1
Pip	1
but	1
felt	1
so	1
kind	1
a	1
thing	1
as	1
this,	1
perhaps	1
he	1
had	1
ne'er	1
been	1
lost!	1
This	1
seems	1
to	1
me,	1
sir,	1
as	1
a	1
man-rope;	1
something	1
that	1
weak	1
souls	1
may	1
hold	1
by.	1
Oh,	1
sir,	1
let	1
old	1
Perth	1
now	1
come	1
and	1
rivet	1
these	1
two	1
hands	1
together;	1
the	1
black	1
one	1
with	1
the	1
white,	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
let	1
this	1
go."	1
"Oh,	1
boy,	1
nor	1
will	1
I	1
thee,	1
unless	1
I	1
should	1
thereby	1
drag	1
thee	1
to	1
worse	1
horrors	1
than	1
are	1
here.	1
Come,	1
then,	1
to	1
my	1
cabin.	1
Lo!	1
ye	1
believers	1
in	1
gods	1
all	1
goodness,	1
and	1
in	1
man	1
all	1
ill,	1
lo	1
you!	1
see	1
the	1
omniscient	1
gods	1
oblivious	1
of	1
suffering	1
man;	1
and	1
man,	1
though	1
idiotic,	1
and	1
knowing	1
not	1
what	1
he	1
does,	1
yet	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
sweet	1
things	1
of	1
love	1
and	1
gratitude.	1
Come!	1
I	1
feel	1
prouder	1
leading	1
thee	1
by	1
thy	1
black	1
hand,	1
than	1
though	1
I	1
grasped	1
an	1
Emperor's!"	1
"There	1
go	1
two	1
daft	1
ones	1
now,"	1
muttered	1
the	1
old	1
Manxman.	1
"One	1
daft	1
with	1
strength,	1
the	1
other	1
daft	1
with	1
weakness.	1
But	1
here's	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
rotten	1
line--all	1
dripping,	1
too.	1
Mend	1
it,	1
eh?	1
I	1
think	1
we	1
had	1
best	1
have	1
a	1
new	1
line	1
altogether.	1
I'll	1
see	1
Mr.	1
Stubb	1
about	1
it."	1
CHAPTER	1
126	1
The	1
Life-Buoy.	1
Steering	1
now	1
south-eastward	1
by	1
Ahab's	1
levelled	1
steel,	1
and	1
her	1
progress	1
solely	1
determined	1
by	1
Ahab's	1
level	1
log	1
and	1
line;	1
the	1
Pequod	1
held	1
on	1
her	1
path	1
towards	1
the	1
Equator.	1
Making	1
so	1
long	1
a	1
passage	1
through	1
such	1
unfrequented	1
waters,	1
descrying	1
no	1
ships,	1
and	1
ere	1
long,	1
sideways	1
impelled	1
by	1
unvarying	1
trade	1
winds,	1
over	1
waves	1
monotonously	1
mild;	1
all	1
these	1
seemed	1
the	1
strange	1
calm	1
things	1
preluding	1
some	1
riotous	1
and	1
desperate	1
scene.	1
At	1
last,	1
when	1
the	1
ship	1
drew	1
near	1
to	1
the	1
outskirts,	1
as	1
it	1
were,	1
of	1
the	1
Equatorial	1
fishing-ground,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
deep	1
darkness	1
that	1
goes	1
before	1
the	1
dawn,	1
was	1
sailing	1
by	1
a	1
cluster	1
of	1
rocky	1
islets;	1
the	1
watch--then	1
headed	1
by	1
Flask--was	1
startled	1
by	1
a	1
cry	1
so	1
plaintively	1
wild	1
and	1
unearthly--like	1
half-articulated	1
wailings	1
of	1
the	1
ghosts	1
of	1
all	1
Herod's	1
murdered	1
Innocents--that	1
one	1
and	1
all,	1
they	1
started	1
from	1
their	1
reveries,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
some	1
moments	1
stood,	1
or	1
sat,	1
or	1
leaned	1
all	1
transfixedly	1
listening,	1
like	1
the	1
carved	1
Roman	1
slave,	1
while	1
that	1
wild	1
cry	1
remained	1
within	1
hearing.	1
The	1
Christian	1
or	1
civilized	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
crew	1
said	1
it	1
was	1
mermaids,	1
and	1
shuddered;	1
but	1
the	1
pagan	1
harpooneers	1
remained	1
unappalled.	1
Yet	1
the	1
grey	1
Manxman--the	1
oldest	1
mariner	1
of	1
all--declared	1
that	1
the	1
wild	1
thrilling	1
sounds	1
that	1
were	1
heard,	1
were	1
the	1
voices	1
of	1
newly	1
drowned	1
men	1
in	1
the	1
sea.	1
Below	1
in	1
his	1
hammock,	1
Ahab	1
did	1
not	1
hear	1
of	1
this	1
till	1
grey	1
dawn,	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
deck;	1
it	1
was	1
then	1
recounted	1
to	1
him	1
by	1
Flask,	1
not	1
unaccompanied	1
with	1
hinted	1
dark	1
meanings.	1
He	1
hollowly	1
laughed,	1
and	1
thus	1
explained	1
the	1
wonder.	1
Those	1
rocky	1
islands	1
the	1
ship	1
had	1
passed	1
were	1
the	1
resort	1
of	1
great	1
numbers	1
of	1
seals,	1
and	1
some	1
young	1
seals	1
that	1
had	1
lost	1
their	1
dams,	1
or	1
some	1
dams	1
that	1
had	1
lost	1
their	1
cubs,	1
must	1
have	1
risen	1
nigh	1
the	1
ship	1
and	1
kept	1
company	1
with	1
her,	1
crying	1
and	1
sobbing	1
with	1
their	1
human	1
sort	1
of	1
wail.	1
But	1
this	1
only	1
the	1
more	1
affected	1
some	1
of	1
them,	1
because	1
most	1
mariners	1
cherish	1
a	1
very	1
superstitious	1
feeling	1
about	1
seals,	1
arising	1
not	1
only	1
from	1
their	1
peculiar	1
tones	1
when	1
in	1
distress,	1
but	1
also	1
from	1
the	1
human	1
look	1
of	1
their	1
round	1
heads	1
and	1
semi-intelligent	1
faces,	1
seen	1
peeringly	1
uprising	1
from	1
the	1
water	1
alongside.	1
In	1
the	1
sea,	1
under	1
certain	1
circumstances,	1
seals	1
have	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
been	1
mistaken	1
for	1
men.	1
But	1
the	1
bodings	1
of	1
the	1
crew	1
were	1
destined	1
to	1
receive	1
a	1
most	1
plausible	1
confirmation	1
in	1
the	1
fate	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
their	1
number	1
that	1
morning.	1
At	1
sun-rise	1
this	1
man	1
went	1
from	1
his	1
hammock	1
to	1
his	1
mast-head	1
at	1
the	1
fore;	1
and	1
whether	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
yet	1
half	1
waked	1
from	1
his	1
sleep	1
(for	1
sailors	1
sometimes	1
go	1
aloft	1
in	1
a	1
transition	1
state),	1
whether	1
it	1
was	1
thus	1
with	1
the	1
man,	1
there	1
is	1
now	1
no	1
telling;	1
but,	1
be	1
that	1
as	1
it	1
may,	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
long	1
at	1
his	1
perch,	1
when	1
a	1
cry	1
was	1
heard--a	1
cry	1
and	1
a	1
rushing--and	1
looking	1
up,	1
they	1
saw	1
a	1
falling	1
phantom	1
in	1
the	1
air;	1
and	1
looking	1
down,	1
a	1
little	1
tossed	1
heap	1
of	1
white	1
bubbles	1
in	1
the	1
blue	1
of	1
the	1
sea.	1
The	1
life-buoy--a	1
long	1
slender	1
cask--was	1
dropped	1
from	1
the	1
stern,	1
where	1
it	1
always	1
hung	1
obedient	1
to	1
a	1
cunning	1
spring;	1
but	1
no	1
hand	1
rose	1
to	1
seize	1
it,	1
and	1
the	1
sun	1
having	1
long	1
beat	1
upon	1
this	1
cask	1
it	1
had	1
shrunken,	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
slowly	1
filled,	1
and	1
that	1
parched	1
wood	1
also	1
filled	1
at	1
its	1
every	1
pore;	1
and	1
the	1
studded	1
iron-bound	1
cask	1
followed	1
the	1
sailor	1
to	1
the	1
bottom,	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
yield	1
him	1
his	1
pillow,	1
though	1
in	1
sooth	1
but	1
a	1
hard	1
one.	1
And	1
thus	1
the	1
first	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
Pequod	1
that	1
mounted	1
the	1
mast	1
to	1
look	1
out	1
for	1
the	1
White	1
Whale,	1
on	1
the	1
White	1
Whale's	1
own	1
peculiar	1
ground;	1
that	1
man	1
was	1
swallowed	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
deep.	1
But	1
few,	1
perhaps,	1
thought	1
of	1
that	1
at	1
the	1
time.	1
Indeed,	1
in	1
some	1
sort,	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
grieved	1
at	1
this	1
event,	1
at	1
least	1
as	1
a	1
portent;	1
for	1
they	1
regarded	1
it,	1
not	1
as	1
a	1
foreshadowing	1
of	1
evil	1
in	1
the	1
future,	1
but	1
as	1
the	1
fulfilment	1
of	1
an	1
evil	1
already	1
presaged.	1
They	1
declared	1
that	1
now	1
they	1
knew	1
the	1
reason	1
of	1
those	1
wild	1
shrieks	1
they	1
had	1
heard	1
the	1
night	1
before.	1
But	1
again	1
the	1
old	1
Manxman	1
said	1
nay.	1
The	1
lost	1
life-buoy	1
was	1
now	1
to	1
be	1
replaced;	1
Starbuck	1
was	1
directed	1
to	1
see	1
to	1
it;	1
but	1
as	1
no	1
cask	1
of	1
sufficient	1
lightness	1
could	1
be	1
found,	1
and	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
feverish	1
eagerness	1
of	1
what	1
seemed	1
the	1
approaching	1
crisis	1
of	1
the	1
voyage,	1
all	1
hands	1
were	1
impatient	1
of	1
any	1
toil	1
but	1
what	1
was	1
directly	1
connected	1
with	1
its	1
final	1
end,	1
whatever	1
that	1
might	1
prove	1
to	1
be;	1
therefore,	1
they	1
were	1
going	1
to	1
leave	1
the	1
ship's	1
stern	1
unprovided	1
with	1
a	1
buoy,	1
when	1
by	1
certain	1
strange	1
signs	1
and	1
inuendoes	1
Queequeg	1
hinted	1
a	1
hint	1
concerning	1
his	1
coffin.	1
"A	1
life-buoy	1
of	1
a	1
coffin!"	1
cried	1
Starbuck,	1
starting.	1
"Rather	1
queer,	1
that,	1
I	1
should	1
say,"	1
said	1
Stubb.	1
"It	1
will	1
make	1
a	1
good	1
enough	1
one,"	1
said	1
Flask,	1
"the	1
carpenter	1
here	1
can	1
arrange	1
it	1
easily."	1
"Bring	1
it	1
up;	1
there's	1
nothing	1
else	1
for	1
it,"	1
said	1
Starbuck,	1
after	1
a	1
melancholy	1
pause.	1
"Rig	1
it,	1
carpenter;	1
do	1
not	1
look	1
at	1
me	1
so--the	1
coffin,	1
I	1
mean.	1
Dost	1
thou	1
hear	1
me?	1
Rig	1
it."	1
"And	1
shall	1
I	1
nail	1
down	1
the	1
lid,	1
sir?"	1
moving	1
his	1
hand	1
as	1
with	1
a	1
hammer.	1
"Aye."	1
"And	1
shall	1
I	1
caulk	1
the	1
seams,	1
sir?"	1
moving	1
his	1
hand	1
as	1
with	1
a	1
caulking-iron.	1
"Aye."	1
"And	1
shall	1
I	1
then	1
pay	1
over	1
the	1
same	1
with	1
pitch,	1
sir?"	1
moving	1
his	1
hand	1
as	1
with	1
a	1
pitch-pot.	1
"Away!	1
what	1
possesses	1
thee	1
to	1
this?	1
Make	1
a	1
life-buoy	1
of	1
the	1
coffin,	1
and	1
no	1
more.--Mr.	1
Stubb,	1
Mr.	1
Flask,	1
come	1
forward	1
with	1
me."	1
"He	1
goes	1
off	1
in	1
a	1
huff.	1
The	1
whole	1
he	1
can	1
endure;	1
at	1
the	1
parts	1
he	1
baulks.	1
Now	1
I	1
don't	1
like	1
this.	1
I	1
make	1
a	1
leg	1
for	1
Captain	1
Ahab,	1
and	1
he	1
wears	1
it	1
like	1
a	1
gentleman;	1
but	1
I	1
make	1
a	1
bandbox	1
for	1
Queequeg,	1
and	1
he	1
won't	1
put	1
his	1
head	1
into	1
it.	1
Are	1
all	1
my	1
pains	1
to	1
go	1
for	1
nothing	1
with	1
that	1
coffin?	1
And	1
now	1
I'm	1
ordered	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
life-buoy	1
of	1
it.	1
It's	1
like	1
turning	1
an	1
old	1
coat;	1
going	1
to	1
bring	1
the	1
flesh	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
now.	1
I	1
don't	1
like	1
this	1
cobbling	1
sort	1
of	1
business--I	1
don't	1
like	1
it	1
at	1
all;	1
it's	1
undignified;	1
it's	1
not	1
my	1
place.	1
Let	1
tinkers'	1
brats	1
do	1
tinkerings;	1
we	1
are	1
their	1
betters.	1
I	1
like	1
to	1
take	1
in	1
hand	1
none	1
but	1
clean,	1
virgin,	1
fair-and-square	1
mathematical	1
jobs,	1
something	1
that	1
regularly	1
begins	1
at	1
the	1
beginning,	1
and	1
is	1
at	1
the	1
middle	1
when	1
midway,	1
and	1
comes	1
to	1
an	1
end	1
at	1
the	1
conclusion;	1
not	1
a	1
cobbler's	1
job,	1
that's	1
at	1
an	1
end	1
in	1
the	1
middle,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
beginning	1
at	1
the	1
end.	1
It's	1
the	1
old	1
woman's	1
tricks	1
to	1
be	1
giving	1
cobbling	1
jobs.	1
Lord!	1
what	1
an	1
affection	1
all	1
old	1
women	1
have	1
for	1
tinkers.	1
I	1
know	1
an	1
old	1
woman	1
of	1
sixty-five	1
who	1
ran	1
away	1
with	1
a	1
bald-headed	1
young	1
tinker	1
once.	1
And	1
that's	1
the	1
reason	1
I	1
never	1
would	1
work	1
for	1
lonely	1
widow	1
old	1
women	1
ashore,	1
when	1
I	1
kept	1
my	1
job-shop	1
in	1
the	1
Vineyard;	1
they	1
might	1
have	1
taken	1
it	1
into	1
their	1
lonely	1
old	1
heads	1
to	1
run	1
off	1
with	1
me.	1
But	1
heigh-ho!	1
there	1
are	1
no	1
caps	1
at	1
sea	1
but	1
snow-caps.	1
Let	1
me	1
see.	1
Nail	1
down	1
the	1
lid;	1
caulk	1
the	1
seams;	1
pay	1
over	1
the	1
same	1
with	1
pitch;	1
batten	1
them	1
down	1
tight,	1
and	1
hang	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
snap-spring	1
over	1
the	1
ship's	1
stern.	1
Were	1
ever	1
such	1
things	1
done	1
before	1
with	1
a	1
coffin?	1
Some	1
superstitious	1
old	1
carpenters,	1
now,	1
would	1
be	1
tied	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
rigging,	1
ere	1
they	1
would	1
do	1
the	1
job.	1
But	1
I'm	1
made	1
of	1
knotty	1
Aroostook	1
hemlock;	1
I	1
don't	1
budge.	1

But	1
never	1

We	1
workers	1
in	1
woods	1
make	1
bridal-bedsteads	1
and	1
card-tables,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
coffins	1
and	1
hearses.	1
We	1
work	1
by	1
the	1
month,	1
or	1
by	1
the	1
job,	1
or	1
by	1
the	1
profit;	1
not	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
ask	1
the	1
why	1
and	1
wherefore	1
of	1
our	1
work,	1
unless	1
it	1
be	1
too	1
confounded	1
cobbling,	1
and	1
then	1
we	1
stash	1
it	1
if	1
we	1
can.	1
Hem!	1
I'll	1
do	1
the	1
job,	1
now,	1
tenderly.	1
I'll	1
have	1
me--let's	1
see--how	1
many	1
in	1
the	1
ship's	1
company,	1
all	1
told?	1
But	1
I've	1
forgotten.	1
Any	1
way,	1
I'll	1
have	1
me	1
thirty	1
separate,	1
Turk's-headed	1
life-lines,	1
each	1
three	1
feet	1
long	1
hanging	1
all	1
round	1
to	1
the	1
coffin.	1
Then,	1
if	1
the	1
hull	1
go	1
down,	1
there'll	1
be	1
thirty	1
lively	1
fellows	1
all	1
fighting	1
for	1
one	1
coffin,	1
a	1
sight	1
not	1
seen	1
very	1
often	1
beneath	1
the	1
sun!	1
Come	1
hammer,	1
caulking-iron,	1
pitch-pot,	1
and	1
marling-spike!	1
Let's	1
to	1
it."	1

FOLLOWING	1
HIM.	1
Back,	1
lad;	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
with	1
ye	1
again	1
presently.	1
He	1
goes!	1
Not	1
this	1
hand	1
complies	1
with	1
my	1
humor	1
more	1
genially	1
than	1
that	1
boy.--Middle	1
aisle	1
of	1
a	1
church!	1
What's	1
here?"	1
"Life-buoy,	1
sir.	1
Mr.	1
Starbuck's	1
orders.	1
Oh,	1
look,	1
sir!	1
Beware	1
the	1
hatchway!"	1
"Thank	1
ye,	1
man.	1
Thy	1
coffin	1
lies	1
handy	1
to	1
the	1
vault."	1
"Sir?	1
The	1
hatchway?	1
oh!	1
So	1
it	1
does,	1
sir,	1
so	1
it	1
does."	1
"Art	1
not	1
thou	1
the	1
leg-maker?	1
Look,	1
did	1
not	1
this	1
stump	1
come	1
from	1
thy	1
shop?"	1
"I	1
believe	1
it	1
did,	1
sir;	1
does	1
the	1
ferrule	1
stand,	1
sir?"	1
"Well	1
enough.	1
But	1
art	1
thou	1
not	1
also	1
the	1
undertaker?"	1
"Aye,	1
sir;	1
I	1
patched	1
up	1
this	1
thing	1
here	1
as	1
a	1
coffin	1
for	1
Queequeg;	1
but	1
they've	1
set	1
me	1
now	1
to	1
turning	1
it	1
into	1
something	1
else."	1
"Then	1
tell	1
me;	1
art	1
thou	1
not	1
an	1
arrant,	1
all-grasping,	1
intermeddling,	1
monopolising,	1
heathenish	1
old	1
scamp,	1
to	1
be	1
one	1
day	1
making	1
legs,	1
and	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
coffins	1
to	1
clap	1
them	1
in,	1
and	1
yet	1
again	1
life-buoys	1
out	1
of	1
those	1
same	1
coffins?	1
Thou	1
art	1
as	1
unprincipled	1
as	1
the	1
gods,	1
and	1
as	1
much	1
of	1
a	1
jack-of-all-trades."	1
"But	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
mean	1
anything,	1
sir.	1
I	1
do	1
as	1
I	1
do."	1
"The	1
gods	1
again.	1
Hark	1
ye,	1
dost	1
thou	1
not	1
ever	1
sing	1
working	1
about	1
a	1
coffin?	1
The	1
Titans,	1
they	1
say,	1
hummed	1
snatches	1
when	1
chipping	1
out	1
the	1
craters	1
for	1
volcanoes;	1
and	1
the	1
grave-digger	1
in	1
the	1
play	1
sings,	1
spade	1
in	1
hand.	1
Dost	1
thou	1
never?"	1
"Sing,	1
sir?	1
Do	1
I	1
sing?	1
Oh,	1
I'm	1
indifferent	1
enough,	1
sir,	1
for	1
that;	1
but	1
the	1
reason	1
why	1
the	1
grave-digger	1
made	1
music	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
because	1
there	1
was	1
none	1
in	1
his	1
spade,	1
sir.	1
But	1
the	1
caulking	1
mallet	1
is	1
full	1
of	1
it.	1
Hark	1
to	1
it."	1
"Aye,	1
and	1
that's	1
because	1
the	1
lid	1
there's	1
a	1
sounding-board;	1
and	1
what	1
in	1
all	1
things	1
makes	1
the	1
sounding-board	1
is	1
this--there's	1
naught	1
beneath.	1
And	1
yet,	1
a	1
coffin	1
with	1
a	1
body	1
in	1
it	1
rings	1
pretty	1
much	1
the	1
same,	1
Carpenter.	1
Hast	1
thou	1
ever	1
helped	1
carry	1
a	1
bier,	1
and	1
heard	1
the	1
coffin	1
knock	1
against	1
the	1
churchyard	1
gate,	1
going	1
in?	1
"Faith,	1
sir,	1
I've--"	1
"Faith?	1
What's	1
that?"	1
"Why,	1
faith,	1
sir,	1
it's	1
only	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
exclamation-like--that's	1
all,	1
sir."	1
"Um,	1
um;	1
go	1
on."	1
"I	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
say,	1
sir,	1
that--"	1
"Art	1
thou	1
a	1
silk-worm?	1
Dost	1
thou	1
spin	1
thy	1
own	1
shroud	1
out	1
of	1
thyself?	1
Look	1
at	1
thy	1
bosom!	1
Despatch!	1
and	1
get	1
these	1
traps	1
out	1
of	1
sight."	1
"He	1
goes	1
aft.	1
That	1
was	1
sudden,	1
now;	1
but	1
squalls	1
come	1
sudden	1
in	1
hot	1
latitudes.	1
I've	1
heard	1
that	1
the	1
Isle	1
of	1
Albemarle,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
Gallipagos,	1
is	1
cut	1
by	1
the	1
Equator	1
right	1
in	1
the	1
middle.	1
Seems	1
to	1
me	1
some	1
sort	1
of	1
Equator	1
cuts	1
yon	1
old	1
man,	1
too,	1
right	1
in	1
his	1
middle.	1
He's	1
always	1
under	1
the	1
Line--fiery	1
hot,	1
I	1
tell	1
ye!	1
He's	1
looking	1
this	1
way--come,	1
oakum;	1
quick.	1
Here	1
we	1
go	1
again.	1
This	1
wooden	1
mallet	1
is	1
the	1
cork,	1
and	1
I'm	1
the	1
professor	1
of	1
musical	1
glasses--tap,	1
tap!"	1
(AHAB	1
TO	1
HIMSELF.)	1
"There's	1
a	1
sight!	1
There's	1
a	1
sound!	1
The	1
grey-headed	1
woodpecker	1
tapping	1
the	1
hollow	1
tree!	1
Blind	1
and	1
dumb	1
might	1
well	1
be	1
envied	1
now.	1
See!	1
that	1
thing	1
rests	1
on	1
two	1
line-tubs,	1
full	1
of	1
tow-lines.	1
A	1
most	1
malicious	1
wag,	1
that	1
fellow.	1
Rat-tat!	1
So	1
man's	1
seconds	1
tick!	1
Oh!	1
how	1
immaterial	1
are	1
all	1
materials!	1
What	1
things	1
real	1
are	1
there,	1
but	1
imponderable	1
thoughts?	1
Here	1
now's	1
the	1
very	1
dreaded	1
symbol	1
of	1
grim	1
death,	1
by	1
a	1
mere	1
hap,	1
made	1
the	1
expressive	1
sign	1
of	1
the	1
help	1
and	1
hope	1
of	1
most	1
endangered	1
life.	1
A	1
life-buoy	1
of	1
a	1
coffin!	1
Does	1
it	1
go	1
further?	1
Can	1
it	1
be	1
that	1
in	1
some	1
spiritual	1
sense	1
the	1
coffin	1
is,	1
after	1
all,	1
but	1
an	1
immortality-preserver!	1
I'll	1
think	1
of	1
that.	1
But	1
no.	1
So	1
far	1
gone	1
am	1
I	1
in	1
the	1
dark	1
side	1
of	1
earth,	1
that	1
its	1
other	1
side,	1
the	1
theoretic	1
bright	1
one,	1
seems	1
but	1
uncertain	1
twilight	1
to	1
me.	1
Will	1
ye	1
never	1
have	1
done,	1
Carpenter,	1
with	1
that	1
accursed	1
sound?	1
I	1
go	1
below;	1
let	1
me	1
not	1
see	1
that	1
thing	1
here	1
when	1
I	1
return	1
again.	1
Now,	1
then,	1
Pip,	1
we'll	1
talk	1
this	1
over;	1
I	1
do	1
suck	1
most	1
wondrous	1
philosophies	1
from	1
thee!	1
Some	1
unknown	1
conduits	1
from	1
the	1
unknown	1
worlds	1
must	1
empty	1
into	1
thee!"	1
CHAPTER	1
128	1
The	1
Pequod	1
Meets	1
The	1
Rachel.	1
Next	1
day,	1
a	1
large	1
ship,	1
the	1
Rachel,	1
was	1
descried,	1
bearing	1
directly	1
down	1
upon	1
the	1
Pequod,	1
all	1
her	1
spars	1
thickly	1
clustering	1
with	1
men.	1
At	1
the	1
time	1
the	1
Pequod	1
was	1
making	1
good	1
speed	1
through	1
the	1
water;	1
but	1
as	1
the	1
broad-winged	1
windward	1
stranger	1
shot	1
nigh	1
to	1
her,	1
the	1
boastful	1
sails	1
all	1
fell	1
together	1
as	1
blank	1
bladders	1
that	1
are	1
burst,	1
and	1
all	1
life	1
fled	1
from	1
the	1
smitten	1
hull.	1
"Bad	1
news;	1
she	1
brings	1
bad	1
news,"	1
muttered	1
the	1
old	1
Manxman.	1
But	1
ere	1
her	1
commander,	1
who,	1
with	1
trumpet	1
to	1
mouth,	1
stood	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
boat;	1
ere	1
he	1
could	1
hopefully	1
hail,	1
Ahab's	1
voice	1
was	1
heard.	1
"Hast	1
seen	1
the	1
White	1
Whale?"	1
"Aye,	1
yesterday.	1
Have	1
ye	1
seen	1
a	1
whale-boat	1
adrift?"	1
Throttling	1
his	1
joy,	1
Ahab	1
negatively	1
answered	1
this	1
unexpected	1
question;	1
and	1
would	1
then	1
have	1
fain	1
boarded	1
the	1
stranger,	1
when	1
the	1
stranger	1
captain	1
himself,	1
having	1
stopped	1
his	1
vessel's	1
way,	1
was	1
seen	1
descending	1
her	1
side.	1
A	1
few	1
keen	1
pulls,	1
and	1
his	1
boat-hook	1
soon	1
clinched	1
the	1
Pequod's	1
main-chains,	1
and	1
he	1
sprang	1
to	1
the	1
deck.	1
Immediately	1
he	1
was	1
recognised	1
by	1
Ahab	1
for	1
a	1
Nantucketer	1
he	1
knew.	1
But	1
no	1
formal	1
salutation	1
was	1
exchanged.	1
"Where	1
was	1
he?--not	1
killed!--not	1
killed!"	1
cried	1
Ahab,	1
closely	1
advancing.	1
"How	1
was	1
it?"	1
It	1
seemed	1
that	1
somewhat	1
late	1
on	1
the	1
afternoon	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
previous,	1
while	1
three	1
of	1
the	1
stranger's	1
boats	1
were	1
engaged	1
with	1
a	1
shoal	1
of	1
whales,	1
which	1
had	1
led	1
them	1
some	1
four	1
or	1
five	1
miles	1
from	1
the	1
ship;	1
and	1
while	1
they	1
were	1
yet	1
in	1
swift	1
chase	1
to	1
windward,	1
the	1
white	1
hump	1
and	1
head	1
of	1
Moby	1
Dick	1
had	1
suddenly	1
loomed	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
water,	1
not	1
very	1
far	1
to	1
leeward;	1
whereupon,	1
the	1
fourth	1
rigged	1
boat--a	1
reserved	1
one--had	1
been	1
instantly	1
lowered	1
in	1
chase.	1
After	1
a	1
keen	1
sail	1
before	1
the	1
wind,	1
this	1
fourth	1
boat--the	1
swiftest	1
keeled	1
of	1
all--seemed	1
to	1
have	1
succeeded	1
in	1
fastening--at	1
least,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
man	1
at	1
the	1
mast-head	1
could	1
tell	1
anything	1
about	1
it.	1
In	1
the	1
distance	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
diminished	1
dotted	1
boat;	1
and	1
then	1
a	1
swift	1
gleam	1
of	1
bubbling	1
white	1
water;	1
and	1
after	1
that	1
nothing	1
more;	1
whence	1
it	1
was	1
concluded	1
that	1
the	1
stricken	1
whale	1
must	1
have	1
indefinitely	1
run	1
away	1
with	1
his	1
pursuers,	1
as	1
often	1
happens.	1
There	1
was	1
some	1
apprehension,	1
but	1
no	1
positive	1
alarm,	1
as	1
yet.	1
The	1
recall	1
signals	1
were	1
placed	1
in	1
the	1
rigging;	1
darkness	1
came	1
on;	1
and	1
forced	1
to	1
pick	1
up	1
her	1
three	1
far	1
to	1
windward	1
boats--ere	1
going	1
in	1
quest	1
of	1
the	1
fourth	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
precisely	1
opposite	1
direction--the	1
ship	1
had	1
not	1
only	1
been	1
necessitated	1
to	1
leave	1
that	1
boat	1
to	1
its	1
fate	1
till	1
near	1
midnight,	1
but,	1
for	1
the	1
time,	1
to	1
increase	1
her	1
distance	1
from	1
it.	1
But	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
her	1
crew	1
being	1
at	1
last	1
safe	1
aboard,	1
she	1
crowded	1
all	1
sail--stunsail	1
on	1
stunsail--after	1
the	1
missing	1
boat;	1
kindling	1
a	1
fire	1
in	1
her	1
try-pots	1
for	1
a	1
beacon;	1
and	1
every	1
other	1
man	1
aloft	1
on	1
the	1
look-out.	1
But	1
though	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
thus	1
sailed	1
a	1
sufficient	1
distance	1
to	1
gain	1
the	1
presumed	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
absent	1
ones	1
when	1
last	1
seen;	1
though	1
she	1
then	1
paused	1
to	1
lower	1
her	1
spare	1
boats	1
to	1
pull	1
all	1
around	1
her;	1
and	1
not	1
finding	1
anything,	1
had	1
again	1
dashed	1
on;	1
again	1
paused,	1
and	1
lowered	1
her	1
boats;	1
and	1
though	1
she	1
had	1
thus	1
continued	1
doing	1
till	1
daylight;	1
yet	1
not	1
the	1
least	1
glimpse	1
of	1
the	1
missing	1
keel	1
had	1
been	1
seen.	1
The	1
story	1
told,	1
the	1
stranger	1
Captain	1
immediately	1
went	1
on	1
to	1
reveal	1
his	1
object	1
in	1
boarding	1
the	1
Pequod.	1
He	1
desired	1
that	1
ship	1
to	1
unite	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
in	1
the	1
search;	1
by	1
sailing	1
over	1
the	1
sea	1
some	1
four	1
or	1
five	1
miles	1
apart,	1
on	1
parallel	1
lines,	1
and	1
so	1
sweeping	1
a	1
double	1
horizon,	1
as	1
it	1
were.	1
"I	1
will	1
wager	1
something	1
now,"	1
whispered	1
Stubb	1
to	1
Flask,	1
"that	1
some	1
one	1
in	1
that	1
missing	1
boat	1
wore	1
off	1
that	1
Captain's	1
best	1
coat;	1
mayhap,	1
his	1
watch--he's	1
so	1
cursed	1
anxious	1
to	1
get	1
it	1
back.	1
Who	1
ever	1
heard	1
of	1
two	1
pious	1
whale-ships	1
cruising	1
after	1
one	1
missing	1
whale-boat	1
in	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
the	1
whaling	1
season?	1
See,	1
Flask,	1
only	1
see	1
how	1
pale	1
he	1
looks--pale	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
buttons	1
of	1
his	1
eyes--look--it	1
wasn't	1
the	1
coat--it	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
the--"	1
"My	1
boy,	1
my	1
own	1
boy	1
is	1
among	1
them.	1
For	1
God's	1
sake--I	1
beg,	1
I	1
conjure"--here	1
exclaimed	1
the	1
stranger	1
Captain	1
to	1
Ahab,	1
who	1
thus	1
far	1
had	1
but	1
icily	1
received	1
his	1
petition.	1
"For	1
eight-and-forty	1
hours	1
let	1
me	1
charter	1
your	1
ship--I	1
will	1
gladly	1
pay	1
for	1
it,	1
and	1
roundly	1
pay	1
for	1
it--if	1
there	1
be	1
no	1
other	1
way--for	1
eight-and-forty	1
hours	1
only--only	1
that--you	1
must,	1
oh,	1
you	1
must,	1
and	1
you	1
SHALL	1
do	1
this	1
thing."	1
"His	1
son!"	1
cried	1
Stubb,	1
"oh,	1
it's	1
his	1
son	1
he's	1
lost!	1
I	1
take	1
back	1
the	1
coat	1
and	1
watch--what	1
says	1
Ahab?	1
We	1
must	1
save	1
that	1
boy."	1
"He's	1
drowned	1
with	1
the	1
rest	1
on	1
'em,	1
last	1
night,"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
Manx	1
sailor	1
standing	1
behind	1
them;	1
"I	1
heard;	1
all	1
of	1
ye	1
heard	1
their	1
spirits."	1
Now,	1
as	1
it	1
shortly	1
turned	1
out,	1
what	1
made	1
this	1
incident	1
of	1
the	1
Rachel's	1
the	1
more	1
melancholy,	1
was	1
the	1
circumstance,	1
that	1
not	1
only	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
Captain's	1
sons	1
among	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
missing	1
boat's	1
crew;	1
but	1
among	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
boat's	1
crews,	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
hand,	1
separated	1
from	1
the	1
ship	1
during	1
the	1
dark	1
vicissitudes	1
of	1
the	1
chase,	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
still	1
another	1
son;	1
as	1
that	1
for	1
a	1
time,	1
the	1
wretched	1
father	1
was	1
plunged	1
to	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
cruellest	1
perplexity;	1
which	1
was	1
only	1
solved	1
for	1
him	1
by	1
his	1
chief	1
mate's	1
instinctively	1
adopting	1
the	1
ordinary	1
procedure	1
of	1
a	1
whale-ship	1
in	1
such	1
emergencies,	1
that	1
is,	1
when	1
placed	1
between	1
jeopardized	1
but	1
divided	1
boats,	1
always	1
to	1
pick	1
up	1
the	1
majority	1
first.	1
But	1
the	1
captain,	1
for	1
some	1
unknown	1
constitutional	1
reason,	1
had	1
refrained	1
from	1
mentioning	1
all	1
this,	1
and	1
not	1
till	1
forced	1
to	1
it	1
by	1
Ahab's	1
iciness	1
did	1
he	1
allude	1
to	1
his	1
one	1
yet	1
missing	1
boy;	1
a	1
little	1
lad,	1
but	1
twelve	1
years	1
old,	1
whose	1
father	1
with	1
the	1
earnest	1
but	1
unmisgiving	1
hardihood	1
of	1
a	1
Nantucketer's	1
paternal	1
love,	1
had	1
thus	1
early	1
sought	1
to	1
initiate	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
perils	1
and	1
wonders	1
of	1
a	1
vocation	1
almost	1
immemorially	1
the	1
destiny	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
race.	1
Nor	1
does	1
it	1
unfrequently	1
occur,	1
that	1
Nantucket	1
captains	1
will	1
send	1
a	1
son	1
of	1
such	1
tender	1
age	1
away	1
from	1
them,	1
for	1
a	1
protracted	1
three	1
or	1
four	1
years'	1
voyage	1
in	1
some	1
other	1
ship	1
than	1
their	1
own;	1
so	1
that	1
their	1
first	1
knowledge	1
of	1
a	1
whaleman's	1
career	1
shall	1
be	1
unenervated	1
by	1
any	1
chance	1
display	1
of	1
a	1
father's	1
natural	1
but	1
untimely	1
partiality,	1
or	1
undue	1
apprehensiveness	1
and	1
concern.	1
Meantime,	1
now	1
the	1
stranger	1
was	1
still	1
beseeching	1
his	1
poor	1
boon	1
of	1
Ahab;	1
and	1
Ahab	1
still	1
stood	1
like	1
an	1
anvil,	1
receiving	1
every	1
shock,	1
but	1
without	1
the	1
least	1
quivering	1
of	1
his	1
own.	1
"I	1
will	1
not	1
go,"	1
said	1
the	1
stranger,	1
"till	1
you	1
say	1
aye	1
to	1
me.	1
Do	1
to	1
me	1
as	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
me	1
do	1
to	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
like	1
case.	1
For	1
YOU	1
too	1
have	1
a	1
boy,	1
Captain	1
Ahab--though	1
but	1
a	1
child,	1
and	1
nestling	1
safely	1
at	1
home	1
now--a	1
child	1
of	1
your	1
old	1
age	1
too--Yes,	1
yes,	1
you	1
relent;	1
I	1
see	1
it--run,	1
run,	1
men,	1
now,	1
and	1
stand	1
by	1
to	1
square	1
in	1
the	1
yards."	1
"Avast,"	1
cried	1
Ahab--"touch	1
not	1
a	1
rope-yarn";	1
then	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
that	1
prolongingly	1
moulded	1
every	1
word--"Captain	1
Gardiner,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
do	1
it.	1
Even	1
now	1
I	1
lose	1
time.	1
Good-bye,	1
good-bye.	1
God	1
bless	1
ye,	1
man,	1
and	1
may	1
I	1
forgive	1
myself,	1
but	1
I	1
must	1
go.	1
Mr.	1
Starbuck,	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
binnacle	1
watch,	1
and	1
in	1
three	1
minutes	1
from	1
this	1
present	1
instant	1
warn	1
off	1
all	1
strangers:	1
then	1
brace	1
forward	1
again,	1
and	1
let	1
the	1
ship	1
sail	1
as	1
before."	1
Hurriedly	1
turning,	1
with	1
averted	1
face,	1
he	1
descended	1
into	1
his	1
cabin,	1
leaving	1
the	1
strange	1
captain	1
transfixed	1
at	1
this	1
unconditional	1
and	1
utter	1
rejection	1
of	1
his	1
so	1
earnest	1
suit.	1
But	1
starting	1
from	1
his	1
enchantment,	1
Gardiner	1
silently	1
hurried	1
to	1
the	1
side;	1
more	1
fell	1
than	1
stepped	1
into	1
his	1
boat,	1
and	1
returned	1
to	1
his	1
ship.	1
Soon	1
the	1
two	1
ships	1
diverged	1
their	1
wakes;	1
and	1
long	1
as	1
the	1
strange	1
vessel	1
was	1
in	1
view,	1
she	1
was	1
seen	1
to	1
yaw	1
hither	1
and	1
thither	1
at	1
every	1
dark	1
spot,	1
however	1
small,	1
on	1
the	1
sea.	1
This	1
way	1
and	1
that	1
her	1
yards	1
were	1
swung	1
round;	1
starboard	1
and	1
larboard,	1
she	1
continued	1
to	1
tack;	1
now	1
she	1
beat	1
against	1
a	1
head	1
sea;	1
and	1
again	1
it	1
pushed	1
her	1
before	1
it;	1
while	1
all	1
the	1
while,	1
her	1
masts	1
and	1
yards	1
were	1
thickly	1
clustered	1
with	1
men,	1
as	1
three	1
tall	1
cherry	1
trees,	1
when	1
the	1
boys	1
are	1
cherrying	1
among	1
the	1
boughs.	1
But	1
by	1
her	1
still	1
halting	1
course	1
and	1
winding,	1
woeful	1
way,	1
you	1
plainly	1
saw	1
that	1
this	1
ship	1
that	1
so	1
wept	1
with	1
spray,	1
still	1
remained	1
without	1
comfort.	1
She	1
was	1
Rachel,	1
weeping	1
for	1
her	1
children,	1
because	1
they	1
were	1
not.	1
CHAPTER	1
129	1
The	1
Cabin.	1
(AHAB	1
MOVING	1
TO	1
GO	1
ON	1
DECK;	1
PIP	1
CATCHES	1
HIM	1
BY	1
THE	1
HAND	1
TO	1
FOLLOW.)	1
Lad,	1
lad,	1
I	1
tell	1
thee	1
thou	1
must	1
not	1
follow	1
Ahab	1
now.	1
The	1
hour	1
is	1
coming	1
when	1
Ahab	1
would	1
not	1
scare	1
thee	1
from	1
him,	1
yet	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
thee	1
by	1
him.	1
There	1
is	1
that	1
in	1
thee,	1
poor	1
lad,	1
which	1
I	1
feel	1
too	1
curing	1
to	1
my	1
malady.	1
Like	1
cures	1
like;	1
and	1
for	1
this	1
hunt,	1
my	1
malady	1
becomes	1
my	1
most	1
desired	1
health.	1
Do	1
thou	1
abide	1
below	1
here,	1
where	1
they	1
shall	1
serve	1
thee,	1
as	1
if	1
thou	1
wert	1
the	1
captain.	1
Aye,	1
lad,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
sit	1
here	1
in	1
my	1
own	1
screwed	1
chair;	1
another	1
screw	1
to	1
it,	1
thou	1
must	1
be."	1
"No,	1
no,	1
no!	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
a	1
whole	1
body,	1
sir;	1
do	1
ye	1
but	1
use	1
poor	1
me	1
for	1
your	1
one	1
lost	1
leg;	1
only	1
tread	1
upon	1
me,	1
sir;	1
I	1
ask	1
no	1
more,	1
so	1
I	1
remain	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
ye."	1
"Oh!	1
spite	1
of	1
million	1
villains,	1
this	1
makes	1
me	1
a	1
bigot	1
in	1
the	1
fadeless	1
fidelity	1
of	1
man!--and	1
a	1
black!	1
and	1
crazy!--but	1
methinks	1
like-cures-like	1
applies	1
to	1
him	1
too;	1
he	1
grows	1
so	1
sane	1
again."	1
"They	1
tell	1
me,	1
sir,	1
that	1
Stubb	1
did	1
once	1
desert	1
poor	1
little	1
Pip,	1
whose	1
drowned	1
bones	1
now	1
show	1
white,	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
blackness	1
of	1
his	1
living	1
skin.	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
never	1
desert	1
ye,	1
sir,	1
as	1
Stubb	1
did	1
him.	1
Sir,	1
I	1
must	1
go	1
with	1
ye."	1
"If	1
thou	1
speakest	1
thus	1
to	1
me	1
much	1
more,	1
Ahab's	1
purpose	1
keels	1
up	1
in	1
him.	1
I	1
tell	1
thee	1
no;	1
it	1
cannot	1
be."	1
"Oh	1
good	1
master,	1
master,	1
master!	1
"Weep	1
so,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
murder	1
thee!	1
have	1
a	1
care,	1
for	1
Ahab	1
too	1
is	1
mad.	1
Listen,	1
and	1
thou	1
wilt	1
often	1
hear	1
my	1
ivory	1
foot	1
upon	1
the	1
deck,	1
and	1
still	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
there.	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
quit	1
thee.	1
Thy	1
hand!--Met!	1
True	1
art	1
thou,	1
lad,	1
as	1
the	1
circumference	1
to	1
its	1
centre.	1
So:	1
God	1
for	1
ever	1
bless	1
thee;	1
and	1
if	1
it	1
come	1
to	1
that,--God	1
for	1
ever	1
save	1
thee,	1
let	1
what	1
will	1
befall."	1
(AHAB	1
GOES;	1
PIP	1
STEPS	1
ONE	1
STEP	1
FORWARD.)	1
"Here	1
he	1
this	1
instant	1
stood;	1
I	1
stand	1
in	1
his	1
air,--but	1
I'm	1
alone.	1
Now	1
were	1
even	1
poor	1
Pip	1
here	1
I	1
could	1
endure	1
it,	1
but	1
he's	1
missing.	1
Pip!	1
Pip!	1
Ding,	1
dong,	1
ding!	1
Who's	1
seen	1
Pip?	1
He	1
must	1
be	1
up	1
here;	1
let's	1
try	1
the	1
door.	1
What?	1
neither	1
lock,	1
nor	1
bolt,	1
nor	1
bar;	1
and	1
yet	1
there's	1
no	1
opening	1
it.	1
It	1
must	1
be	1
the	1
spell;	1
he	1
told	1
me	1
to	1
stay	1
here:	1
Aye,	1
and	1
told	1
me	1
this	1
screwed	1
chair	1
was	1
mine.	1
Here,	1
then,	1
I'll	1
seat	1
me,	1
against	1
the	1
transom,	1
in	1
the	1
ship's	1
full	1
middle,	1
all	1
her	1
keel	1
and	1
her	1
three	1
masts	1
before	1
me.	1
Here,	1
our	1
old	1
sailors	1
say,	1
in	1
their	1
black	1
seventy-fours	1
great	1
admirals	1
sometimes	1
sit	1
at	1
table,	1
and	1
lord	1
it	1
over	1
rows	1
of	1
captains	1
and	1
lieutenants.	1
Ha!	1
what's	1
this?	1
epaulets!	1
epaulets!	1
the	1
epaulets	1
all	1
come	1
crowding!	1
Pass	1
round	1
the	1
decanters;	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
ye;	1
fill	1
up,	1
monsieurs!	1
What	1
an	1
odd	1
feeling,	1
now,	1
when	1
a	1
black	1
boy's	1
host	1
to	1
white	1
men	1
with	1
gold	1
lace	1
upon	1
their	1
coats!--Monsieurs,	1
have	1
ye	1
seen	1
one	1
Pip?--a	1
little	1
negro	1
lad,	1
five	1
feet	1
high,	1
hang-dog	1
look,	1
and	1
cowardly!	1
Jumped	1
from	1
a	1
whale-boat	1
once;--seen	1
him?	1
No!	1
Well	1
then,	1
fill	1
up	1
again,	1
captains,	1
and	1
let's	1
drink	1
shame	1
upon	1
all	1
cowards!	1
I	1
name	1
no	1
names.	1
Shame	1
upon	1
them!	1
Put	1
one	1
foot	1
upon	1
the	1
table.	1
Shame	1
upon	1
all	1
cowards.--Hist!	1
above	1
there,	1
I	1
hear	1
ivory--Oh,	1
master!	1
master!	1
I	1
am	1
indeed	1
down-hearted	1
when	1
you	1
walk	1
over	1
me.	1
But	1
here	1
I'll	1
stay,	1
though	1
this	1
stern	1
strikes	1
rocks;	1
and	1
they	1
bulge	1
through;	1
and	1
oysters	1
come	1
to	1
join	1
me."	1
CHAPTER	1
130	1
The	1
Hat.	1
And	1
now	1
that	1
at	1
the	1
proper	1
time	1
and	1
place,	1
after	1
so	1
long	1
and	1
wide	1
a	1
preliminary	1
cruise,	1
Ahab,--all	1
other	1
whaling	1
waters	1
swept--seemed	1
to	1
have	1
chased	1
his	1
foe	1
into	1
an	1
ocean-fold,	1
to	1
slay	1
him	1
the	1
more	1
securely	1
there;	1
now,	1
that	1
he	1
found	1
himself	1
hard	1
by	1
the	1
very	1
latitude	1
and	1
longitude	1
where	1
his	1
tormenting	1
wound	1
had	1
been	1
inflicted;	1
now	1
that	1
a	1
vessel	1
had	1
been	1
spoken	1
which	1
on	1
the	1
very	1
day	1
preceding	1
had	1
actually	1
encountered	1
Moby	1
Dick;--and	1
now	1
that	1
all	1
his	1
successive	1
meetings	1
with	1
various	1
ships	1
contrastingly	1
concurred	1
to	1
show	1
the	1
demoniac	1
indifference	1
with	1
which	1
the	1
white	1
whale	1
tore	1
his	1
hunters,	1
whether	1
sinning	1
or	1
sinned	1
against;	1
now	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
there	1
lurked	1
a	1
something	1
in	1
the	1
old	1
man's	1
eyes,	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
hardly	1
sufferable	1
for	1
feeble	1
souls	1
to	1
see.	1
As	1
the	1
unsetting	1
polar	1
star,	1
which	1
through	1
the	1
livelong,	1
arctic,	1
six	1
months'	1
night	1
sustains	1
its	1
piercing,	1
steady,	1
central	1
gaze;	1
so	1
Ahab's	1
purpose	1
now	1
fixedly	1
gleamed	1
down	1
upon	1
the	1
constant	1
midnight	1
of	1
the	1
gloomy	1
crew.	1
It	1
domineered	1
above	1
them	1
so,	1
that	1
all	1
their	1
bodings,	1
doubts,	1
misgivings,	1
fears,	1
were	1
fain	1
to	1
hide	1
beneath	1
their	1
souls,	1
and	1
not	1
sprout	1
forth	1
a	1
single	1
spear	1
or	1
leaf.	1
In	1
this	1
foreshadowing	1
interval	1
too,	1
all	1
humor,	1
forced	1
or	1
natural,	1
vanished.	1
Stubb	1
no	1
more	1
strove	1
to	1
raise	1
a	1
smile;	1
Starbuck	1
no	1
more	1
strove	1
to	1
check	1
one.	1
Alike,	1
joy	1
and	1
sorrow,	1
hope	1
and	1
fear,	1
seemed	1
ground	1
to	1
finest	1
dust,	1
and	1
powdered,	1
for	1
the	1
time,	1
in	1
the	1
clamped	1
mortar	1
of	1
Ahab's	1
iron	1
soul.	1
Like	1
machines,	1
they	1
dumbly	1
moved	1
about	1
the	1
deck,	1
ever	1
conscious	1
that	1
the	1
old	1
man's	1
despot	1
eye	1
was	1
on	1
them.	1
But	1
did	1
you	1
deeply	1
scan	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
more	1
secret	1
confidential	1
hours;	1
when	1
he	1
thought	1
no	1
glance	1
but	1
one	1
was	1
on	1
him;	1
then	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
seen	1
that	1
even	1
as	1
Ahab's	1
eyes	1
so	1
awed	1
the	1
crew's,	1
the	1
inscrutable	1
Parsee's	1
glance	1
awed	1
his;	1
or	1
somehow,	1
at	1
least,	1
in	1
some	1
wild	1
way,	1
at	1
times	1
affected	1
it.	1
Such	1
an	1
added,	1
gliding	1
strangeness	1
began	1
to	1
invest	1
the	1
thin	1
Fedallah	1
now;	1
such	1
ceaseless	1
shudderings	1
shook	1
him;	1
that	1
the	1
men	1
looked	1
dubious	1
at	1
him;	1
half	1
uncertain,	1
as	1
it	1
seemed,	1
whether	1
indeed	1
he	1
were	1
a	1
mortal	1
substance,	1
or	1
else	1
a	1
tremulous	1
shadow	1
cast	1
upon	1
the	1
deck	1
by	1
some	1
unseen	1
being's	1
body.	1
And	1
that	1
shadow	1
was	1
always	1
hovering	1
there.	1
For	1
not	1
by	1
night,	1
even,	1
had	1
Fedallah	1
ever	1
certainly	1
been	1
known	1
to	1
slumber,	1
or	1
go	1
below.	1
He	1
would	1
stand	1
still	1
for	1
hours:	1
but	1
never	1
sat	1
or	1
leaned;	1
his	1
wan	1
but	1
wondrous	1
eyes	1
did	1
plainly	1
say--We	1
two	1
watchmen	1
never	1
rest.	1
Nor,	1
at	1
any	1
time,	1
by	1
night	1
or	1
day	1
could	1
the	1
mariners	1
now	1
step	1
upon	1
the	1
deck,	1
unless	1
Ahab	1
was	1
before	1
them;	1
either	1
standing	1
in	1
his	1
pivot-hole,	1
or	1
exactly	1
pacing	1
the	1
planks	1
between	1
two	1
undeviating	1
limits,--the	1
main-mast	1
and	1
the	1
mizen;	1
or	1
else	1
they	1
saw	1
him	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
cabin-scuttle,--his	1
living	1
foot	1
advanced	1
upon	1
the	1
deck,	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
step;	1
his	1
hat	1
slouched	1
heavily	1
over	1
his	1
eyes;	1
so	1
that	1
however	1
motionless	1
he	1
stood,	1
however	1
the	1
days	1
and	1
nights	1
were	1
added	1
on,	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
swung	1
in	1
his	1
hammock;	1
yet	1
hidden	1
beneath	1
that	1
slouching	1
hat,	1
they	1
could	1
never	1
tell	1
unerringly	1
whether,	1
for	1
all	1
this,	1
his	1
eyes	1
were	1
really	1
closed	1
at	1
times;	1
or	1
whether	1
he	1
was	1
still	1
intently	1
scanning	1
them;	1
no	1
matter,	1
though	1
he	1
stood	1
so	1
in	1
the	1
scuttle	1
for	1
a	1
whole	1
hour	1
on	1
the	1
stretch,	1
and	1
the	1
unheeded	1
night-damp	1
gathered	1
in	1
beads	1
of	1
dew	1
upon	1
that	1
stone-carved	1
coat	1
and	1
hat.	1
The	1
clothes	1
that	1
the	1
night	1
had	1
wet,	1
the	1
next	1
day's	1
sunshine	1
dried	1
upon	1
him;	1
and	1
so,	1
day	1
after	1
day,	1
and	1
night	1
after	1
night;	1
he	1
went	1
no	1
more	1
beneath	1
the	1
planks;	1
whatever	1
he	1
wanted	1
from	1
the	1
cabin	1
that	1
thing	1
he	1
sent	1
for.	1
He	1
ate	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
open	1
air;	1
that	1
is,	1
his	1
two	1
only	1
meals,--breakfast	1
and	1
dinner:	1
supper	1
he	1
never	1
touched;	1
nor	1
reaped	1
his	1
beard;	1
which	1
darkly	1
grew	1
all	1
gnarled,	1
as	1
unearthed	1
roots	1
of	1
trees	1
blown	1
over,	1
which	1
still	1
grow	1
idly	1
on	1
at	1
naked	1
base,	1
though	1
perished	1
in	1
the	1
upper	1
verdure.	1
But	1
though	1
his	1
whole	1
life	1
was	1
now	1
become	1
one	1
watch	1
on	1
deck;	1
and	1
though	1
the	1
Parsee's	1
mystic	1
watch	1
was	1
without	1
intermission	1
as	1
his	1
own;	1
yet	1
these	1
two	1
never	1
seemed	1
to	1
speak--one	1
man	1
to	1
the	1
other--unless	1
at	1
long	1
intervals	1
some	1
passing	1
unmomentous	1
matter	1
made	1
it	1
necessary.	1
Though	1
such	1
a	1
potent	1
spell	1
seemed	1
secretly	1
to	1
join	1
the	1
twain;	1
openly,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
awe-struck	1
crew,	1
they	1
seemed	1
pole-like	1
asunder.	1
If	1
by	1
day	1
they	1
chanced	1
to	1
speak	1
one	1
word;	1
by	1
night,	1
dumb	1
men	1
were	1
both,	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
concerned	1
the	1
slightest	1
verbal	1
interchange.	1
At	1
times,	1
for	1
longest	1
hours,	1
without	1
a	1
single	1
hail,	1
they	1
stood	1
far	1
parted	1
in	1
the	1
starlight;	1
Ahab	1
in	1
his	1
scuttle,	1
the	1
Parsee	1
by	1
the	1
mainmast;	1
but	1
still	1
fixedly	1
gazing	1
upon	1
each	1
other;	1
as	1
if	1
in	1
the	1
Parsee	1
Ahab	1
saw	1
his	1
forethrown	1
shadow,	1
in	1
Ahab	1
the	1
Parsee	1
his	1
abandoned	1
substance.	1
And	1
yet,	1
somehow,	1
did	1
Ahab--in	1
his	1
own	1
proper	1
self,	1
as	1
daily,	1
hourly,	1
and	1
every	1
instant,	1
commandingly	1
revealed	1
to	1
his	1
subordinates,--Ahab	1
seemed	1
an	1
independent	1
lord;	1
the	1
Parsee	1
but	1
his	1
slave.	1
Still	1
again	1
both	1
seemed	1
yoked	1
together,	1
and	1
an	1
unseen	1
tyrant	1
driving	1
them;	1
the	1
lean	1
shade	1
siding	1
the	1
solid	1
rib.	1
For	1
be	1
this	1
Parsee	1
what	1
he	1
may,	1
all	1
rib	1
and	1
keel	1
was	1
solid	1
Ahab.	1
At	1
the	1
first	1
faintest	1
glimmering	1
of	1
the	1
dawn,	1
his	1
iron	1
voice	1
was	1
heard	1
from	1
aft,--"Man	1
the	1
mast-heads!"--and	1
all	1
through	1
the	1
day,	1
till	1
after	1
sunset	1
and	1
after	1
twilight,	1
the	1
same	1
voice	1
every	1
hour,	1
at	1
the	1
striking	1
of	1
the	1
helmsman's	1
bell,	1
was	1
heard--"What	1
d'ye	1
see?--sharp!	1
sharp!"	1
But	1
when	1
three	1
or	1
four	1
days	1
had	1
slided	1
by,	1
after	1
meeting	1
the	1
children-seeking	1
Rachel;	1
and	1
no	1
spout	1
had	1
yet	1
been	1
seen;	1
the	1
monomaniac	1
old	1
man	1
seemed	1
distrustful	1
of	1
his	1
crew's	1
fidelity;	1
at	1
least,	1
of	1
nearly	1
all	1
except	1
the	1
Pagan	1
harpooneers;	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
doubt,	1
even,	1
whether	1
Stubb	1
and	1
Flask	1
might	1
not	1
willingly	1
overlook	1
the	1
sight	1
he	1
sought.	1
But	1
if	1
these	1
suspicions	1
were	1
really	1
his,	1
he	1
sagaciously	1
refrained	1
from	1
verbally	1
expressing	1
them,	1
however	1
his	1
actions	1
might	1
seem	1
to	1
hint	1
them.	1
"I	1
will	1
have	1
the	1
first	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
whale	1
myself,"--he	1
said.	1
"Aye!	1
Ahab	1
must	1
have	1
the	1
doubloon!	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
hands	1
he	1
rigged	1
a	1
nest	1
of	1
basketed	1
bowlines;	1
and	1
sending	1
a	1
hand	1
aloft,	1
with	1
a	1
single	1
sheaved	1
block,	1
to	1
secure	1
to	1
the	1
main-mast	1
head,	1
he	1
received	1
the	1
two	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
downward-reeved	1
rope;	1
and	1
attaching	1
one	1
to	1
his	1
basket	1
prepared	1
a	1
pin	1
for	1
the	1
other	1
end,	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
fasten	1
it	1
at	1
the	1
rail.	1
This	1
done,	1
with	1
that	1
end	1
yet	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
standing	1
beside	1
the	1
pin,	1
he	1
looked	1
round	1
upon	1
his	1
crew,	1
sweeping	1
from	1
one	1
to	1
the	1
other;	1
pausing	1
his	1
glance	1
long	1
upon	1
Daggoo,	1
Queequeg,	1
Tashtego;	1
but	1
shunning	1
Fedallah;	1
and	1
then	1
settling	1
his	1
firm	1
relying	1
eye	1
upon	1
the	1
chief	1
mate,	1
said,--"Take	1
the	1
rope,	1
sir--I	1
give	1
it	1
into	1
thy	1
hands,	1
Starbuck."	1
Then	1
arranging	1
his	1
person	1
in	1
the	1
basket,	1
he	1
gave	1
the	1
word	1
for	1
them	1
to	1
hoist	1
him	1
to	1
his	1
perch,	1
Starbuck	1
being	1
the	1
one	1
who	1
secured	1
the	1
rope	1
at	1
last;	1
and	1
afterwards	1
stood	1
near	1
it.	1
And	1
thus,	1
with	1
one	1
hand	1
clinging	1
round	1
the	1
royal	1
mast,	1
Ahab	1
gazed	1
abroad	1
upon	1
the	1
sea	1
for	1
miles	1
and	1
miles,--ahead,	1
astern,	1
this	1
side,	1
and	1
that,--within	1
the	1
wide	1
expanded	1
circle	1
commanded	1
at	1
so	1
great	1
a	1
height.	1
When	1
in	1
working	1
with	1
his	1
hands	1
at	1
some	1
lofty	1
almost	1
isolated	1
place	1
in	1
the	1
rigging,	1
which	1
chances	1
to	1
afford	1
no	1
foothold,	1
the	1
sailor	1
at	1
sea	1
is	1
hoisted	1
up	1
to	1
that	1
spot,	1
and	1
sustained	1
there	1
by	1
the	1
rope;	1
under	1
these	1
circumstances,	1
its	1
fastened	1
end	1
on	1
deck	1
is	1
always	1
given	1
in	1
strict	1
charge	1
to	1
some	1
one	1
man	1
who	1
has	1
the	1
special	1
watch	1
of	1
it.	1
Because	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
wilderness	1
of	1
running	1
rigging,	1
whose	1
various	1
different	1
relations	1
aloft	1
cannot	1
always	1
be	1
infallibly	1
discerned	1
by	1
what	1
is	1
seen	1
of	1
them	1
at	1
the	1
deck;	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
deck-ends	1
of	1
these	1
ropes	1
are	1
being	1
every	1
few	1
minutes	1
cast	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
fastenings,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
but	1
a	1
natural	1
fatality,	1
if,	1
unprovided	1
with	1
a	1
constant	1
watchman,	1
the	1
hoisted	1
sailor	1
should	1
by	1
some	1
carelessness	1
of	1
the	1
crew	1
be	1
cast	1
adrift	1
and	1
fall	1
all	1
swooping	1
to	1
the	1
sea.	1
So	1
Ahab's	1
proceedings	1
in	1
this	1
matter	1
were	1
not	1
unusual;	1
the	1
only	1
strange	1
thing	1
about	1
them	1
seemed	1
to	1
be,	1
that	1
Starbuck,	1
almost	1
the	1
one	1
only	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
ever	1
ventured	1
to	1
oppose	1
him	1
with	1
anything	1
in	1
the	1
slightest	1
degree	1
approaching	1
to	1
decision--one	1
of	1
those	1
too,	1
whose	1
faithfulness	1
on	1
the	1
look-out	1
he	1
had	1
seemed	1
to	1
doubt	1
somewhat;--it	1
was	1
strange,	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
very	1
man	1
he	1
should	1
select	1
for	1
his	1
watchman;	1
freely	1
giving	1
his	1
whole	1
life	1
into	1
such	1
an	1
otherwise	1
distrusted	1
person's	1
hands.	1
Now,	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
Ahab	1
was	1
perched	1
aloft;	1
ere	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
there	1
ten	1
minutes;	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
red-billed	1
savage	1
sea-hawks	1
which	1
so	1
often	1
fly	1
incommodiously	1
close	1
round	1
the	1
manned	1
mast-heads	1
of	1
whalemen	1
in	1
these	1
latitudes;	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
birds	1
came	1
wheeling	1
and	1
screaming	1
round	1
his	1
head	1
in	1
a	1
maze	1
of	1
untrackably	1
swift	1
circlings.	1
Then	1
it	1
darted	1
a	1
thousand	1
feet	1
straight	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
air;	1
then	1
spiralized	1
downwards,	1
and	1
went	1
eddying	1
again	1
round	1
his	1
head.	1
But	1
with	1
his	1
gaze	1
fixed	1
upon	1
the	1
dim	1
and	1
distant	1
horizon,	1
Ahab	1
seemed	1
not	1
to	1
mark	1
this	1
wild	1
bird;	1
nor,	1
indeed,	1
would	1
any	1
one	1
else	1
have	1
marked	1
it	1
much,	1
it	1
being	1
no	1
uncommon	1
circumstance;	1
only	1
now	1
almost	1
the	1
least	1
heedful	1
eye	1
seemed	1
to	1
see	1
some	1
sort	1
of	1
cunning	1
meaning	1
in	1
almost	1
every	1
sight.	1
"Your	1
hat,	1
your	1
hat,	1
sir!"	1
suddenly	1
cried	1
the	1
Sicilian	1
seaman,	1
who	1
being	1
posted	1
at	1
the	1
mizen-mast-head,	1
stood	1
directly	1
behind	1
Ahab,	1
though	1
somewhat	1
lower	1
than	1
his	1
level,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
deep	1
gulf	1
of	1
air	1
dividing	1
them.	1
But	1
already	1
the	1
sable	1
wing	1
was	1
before	1
the	1
old	1
man's	1
eyes;	1
the	1
long	1
hooked	1
bill	1
at	1
his	1
head:	1
with	1
a	1
scream,	1
the	1
black	1
hawk	1
darted	1
away	1
with	1
his	1
prize.	1
An	1
eagle	1
flew	1
thrice	1
round	1
Tarquin's	1
head,	1
removing	1
his	1
cap	1
to	1
replace	1
it,	1
and	1
thereupon	1
Tanaquil,	1
his	1
wife,	1
declared	1
that	1
Tarquin	1
would	1
be	1
king	1
of	1
Rome.	1
But	1
only	1
by	1
the	1
replacing	1
of	1
the	1
cap	1
was	1
that	1
omen	1
accounted	1
good.	1
Ahab's	1
hat	1
was	1
never	1
restored;	1
the	1
wild	1
hawk	1
flew	1
on	1
and	1
on	1
with	1
it;	1
far	1
in	1
advance	1
of	1
the	1
prow:	1
and	1
at	1
last	1
disappeared;	1
while	1
from	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
that	1
disappearance,	1
a	1
minute	1
black	1
spot	1
was	1
dimly	1
discerned,	1
falling	1
from	1
that	1
vast	1
height	1
into	1
the	1
sea.	1
CHAPTER	1
131	1
The	1
Pequod	1
Meets	1
The	1
Delight.	1
The	1
intense	1
Pequod	1
sailed	1
on;	1
the	1
rolling	1
waves	1
and	1
days	1
went	1
by;	1
the	1
life-buoy-coffin	1
still	1
lightly	1
swung;	1
and	1
another	1
ship,	1
most	1
miserably	1
misnamed	1
the	1
Delight,	1
was	1
descried.	1
As	1
she	1
drew	1
nigh,	1
all	1
eyes	1
were	1
fixed	1
upon	1
her	1
broad	1
beams,	1
called	1
shears,	1
which,	1
in	1
some	1
whaling-ships,	1
cross	1
the	1
quarter-deck	1
at	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
eight	1
or	1
nine	1
feet;	1
serving	1
to	1
carry	1
the	1
spare,	1
unrigged,	1
or	1
disabled	1
boats.	1
Upon	1
the	1
stranger's	1
shears	1
were	1
beheld	1
the	1
shattered,	1
white	1
ribs,	1
and	1
some	1
few	1
splintered	1
planks,	1
of	1
what	1
had	1
once	1
been	1
a	1
whale-boat;	1
but	1
you	1
now	1
saw	1
through	1
this	1
wreck,	1
as	1
plainly	1
as	1
you	1
see	1
through	1
the	1
peeled,	1
half-unhinged,	1
and	1
bleaching	1
skeleton	1
of	1
a	1
horse.	1
"Hast	1
seen	1
the	1
White	1
Whale?"	1
"Look!"	1
replied	1
the	1
hollow-cheeked	1
captain	1
from	1
his	1
taffrail;	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
trumpet	1
he	1
pointed	1
to	1
the	1
wreck.	1
"Hast	1
killed	1
him?"	1
"The	1
harpoon	1
is	1
not	1
yet	1
forged	1
that	1
ever	1
will	1
do	1
that,"	1
answered	1
the	1
other,	1
sadly	1
glancing	1
upon	1
a	1
rounded	1
hammock	1
on	1
the	1
deck,	1
whose	1
gathered	1
sides	1
some	1
noiseless	1
sailors	1
were	1
busy	1
in	1
sewing	1
together.	1
"Not	1
forged!"	1
and	1
snatching	1
Perth's	1
levelled	1
iron	1
from	1
the	1
crotch,	1
Ahab	1
held	1
it	1
out,	1
exclaiming--"Look	1
ye,	1
Nantucketer;	1
here	1
in	1
this	1
hand	1
I	1
hold	1
his	1
death!	1
Tempered	1
in	1
blood,	1
and	1
tempered	1
by	1
lightning	1
are	1
these	1
barbs;	1
and	1
I	1
swear	1
to	1
temper	1
them	1
triply	1
in	1
that	1
hot	1
place	1
behind	1
the	1
fin,	1
where	1
the	1
White	1
Whale	1
most	1
feels	1
his	1
accursed	1
life!"	1
"Then	1
God	1
keep	1
thee,	1
old	1
man--see'st	1
thou	1
that"--pointing	1
to	1
the	1
hammock--"I	1
bury	1
but	1
one	1
of	1
five	1
stout	1
men,	1
who	1
were	1
alive	1
only	1
yesterday;	1
but	1
were	1
dead	1
ere	1
night.	1
Only	1
THAT	1
one	1
I	1
bury;	1
the	1
rest	1
were	1
buried	1
before	1
they	1
died;	1
you	1
sail	1
upon	1
their	1
tomb."	1
Then	1
turning	1
to	1
his	1
crew--"Are	1
ye	1
ready	1
there?	1
place	1
the	1
plank	1
then	1
on	1
the	1
rail,	1
and	1
lift	1
the	1
body;	1
so,	1
then--Oh!	1
God"--advancing	1
towards	1
the	1
hammock	1
with	1
uplifted	1
hands--"may	1
the	1
resurrection	1
and	1
the	1
life--"	1
"Brace	1
forward!	1
Up	1
helm!"	1
cried	1
Ahab	1
like	1
lightning	1
to	1
his	1
men.	1
But	1
the	1
suddenly	1
started	1
Pequod	1
was	1
not	1
quick	1
enough	1
to	1
escape	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
splash	1
that	1
the	1
corpse	1
soon	1
made	1
as	1
it	1
struck	1
the	1
sea;	1
not	1
so	1
quick,	1
indeed,	1
but	1
that	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
flying	1
bubbles	1
might	1
have	1
sprinkled	1
her	1
hull	1
with	1
their	1
ghostly	1
baptism.	1
As	1
Ahab	1
now	1
glided	1
from	1
the	1
dejected	1
Delight,	1
the	1
strange	1
life-buoy	1
hanging	1
at	1
the	1
Pequod's	1
stern	1
came	1
into	1
conspicuous	1
relief.	1
"Ha!	1
yonder!	1
look	1
yonder,	1
men!"	1
cried	1
a	1
foreboding	1
voice	1
in	1
her	1
wake.	1
"In	1
vain,	1
oh,	1
ye	1
strangers,	1
ye	1
fly	1
our	1
sad	1
burial;	1
ye	1
but	1
turn	1
us	1
your	1
taffrail	1
to	1
show	1
us	1
your	1
coffin!"	1
CHAPTER	1
132	1
The	1
Symphony.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
clear	1
steel-blue	1
day.	1
The	1
firmaments	1
of	1
air	1
and	1
sea	1
were	1
hardly	1
separable	1
in	1
that	1
all-pervading	1
azure;	1
only,	1
the	1
pensive	1
air	1
was	1
transparently	1
pure	1
and	1
soft,	1
with	1
a	1
woman's	1
look,	1
and	1
the	1
robust	1
and	1
man-like	1
sea	1
heaved	1
with	1
long,	1
strong,	1
lingering	1
swells,	1
as	1
Samson's	1
chest	1
in	1
his	1
sleep.	1
Hither,	1
and	1
thither,	1
on	1
high,	1
glided	1
the	1
snow-white	1
wings	1
of	1
small,	1
unspeckled	1
birds;	1
these	1
were	1
the	1
gentle	1
thoughts	1
of	1
the	1
feminine	1
air;	1
but	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
in	1
the	1
deeps,	1
far	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
bottomless	1
blue,	1
rushed	1
mighty	1
leviathans,	1
sword-fish,	1
and	1
sharks;	1
and	1
these	1
were	1
the	1
strong,	1
troubled,	1
murderous	1
thinkings	1
of	1
the	1
masculine	1
sea.	1
But	1
though	1
thus	1
contrasting	1
within,	1
the	1
contrast	1
was	1
only	1
in	1
shades	1
and	1
shadows	1
without;	1
those	1
two	1
seemed	1
one;	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
the	1
sex,	1
as	1
it	1
were,	1
that	1
distinguished	1
them.	1
Aloft,	1
like	1
a	1
royal	1
czar	1
and	1
king,	1
the	1
sun	1
seemed	1
giving	1
this	1
gentle	1
air	1
to	1
this	1
bold	1
and	1
rolling	1
sea;	1
even	1
as	1
bride	1
to	1
groom.	1
And	1
at	1
the	1
girdling	1
line	1
of	1
the	1
horizon,	1
a	1
soft	1
and	1
tremulous	1
motion--most	1
seen	1
here	1
at	1
the	1
Equator--denoted	1
the	1
fond,	1
throbbing	1
trust,	1
the	1
loving	1
alarms,	1
with	1
which	1
the	1
poor	1
bride	1
gave	1
her	1
bosom	1
away.	1
Tied	1
up	1
and	1
twisted;	1
gnarled	1
and	1
knotted	1
with	1
wrinkles;	1
haggardly	1
firm	1
and	1
unyielding;	1
his	1
eyes	1
glowing	1
like	1
coals,	1
that	1
still	1
glow	1
in	1
the	1
ashes	1
of	1
ruin;	1
untottering	1
Ahab	1
stood	1
forth	1
in	1
the	1
clearness	1
of	1
the	1
morn;	1
lifting	1
his	1
splintered	1
helmet	1
of	1
a	1
brow	1
to	1
the	1
fair	1
girl's	1
forehead	1
of	1
heaven.	1
Oh,	1
immortal	1
infancy,	1
and	1
innocency	1
of	1
the	1
azure!	1
Invisible	1
winged	1
creatures	1
that	1
frolic	1
all	1
round	1
us!	1
Sweet	1
childhood	1
of	1
air	1
and	1
sky!	1
how	1
oblivious	1
were	1
ye	1
of	1
old	1
Ahab's	1
close-coiled	1
woe!	1
But	1
so	1
have	1
I	1
seen	1
little	1
Miriam	1
and	1
Martha,	1
laughing-eyed	1
elves,	1
heedlessly	1
gambol	1
around	1
their	1
old	1
sire;	1
sporting	1
with	1
the	1
circle	1
of	1
singed	1
locks	1
which	1
grew	1
on	1
the	1
marge	1
of	1
that	1
burnt-out	1
crater	1
of	1
his	1
brain.	1
Slowly	1
crossing	1
the	1
deck	1
from	1
the	1
scuttle,	1
Ahab	1
leaned	1
over	1
the	1
side	1
and	1
watched	1
how	1
his	1
shadow	1
in	1
the	1
water	1
sank	1
and	1
sank	1
to	1
his	1
gaze,	1
the	1
more	1
and	1
the	1
more	1
that	1
he	1
strove	1
to	1
pierce	1
the	1
profundity.	1
But	1
the	1
lovely	1
aromas	1
in	1
that	1
enchanted	1
air	1
did	1
at	1
last	1
seem	1
to	1
dispel,	1
for	1
a	1
moment,	1
the	1
cankerous	1
thing	1
in	1
his	1
soul.	1
That	1
glad,	1
happy	1
air,	1
that	1
winsome	1
sky,	1
did	1
at	1
last	1
stroke	1
and	1
caress	1
him;	1
the	1
step-mother	1
world,	1
so	1
long	1
cruel--forbidding--now	1
threw	1
affectionate	1
arms	1
round	1
his	1
stubborn	1
neck,	1
and	1
did	1
seem	1
to	1
joyously	1
sob	1
over	1
him,	1
as	1
if	1
over	1
one,	1
that	1
however	1
wilful	1
and	1
erring,	1
she	1
could	1
yet	1
find	1
it	1
in	1
her	1
heart	1
to	1
save	1
and	1
to	1
bless.	1
From	1
beneath	1
his	1
slouched	1
hat	1
Ahab	1
dropped	1
a	1
tear	1
into	1
the	1
sea;	1
nor	1
did	1
all	1
the	1
Pacific	1
contain	1
such	1
wealth	1
as	1
that	1
one	1
wee	1
drop.	1
Starbuck	1
saw	1
the	1
old	1
man;	1
saw	1
him,	1
how	1
he	1
heavily	1
leaned	1
over	1
the	1
side;	1
and	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
hear	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
true	1
heart	1
the	1
measureless	1
sobbing	1
that	1
stole	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
centre	1
of	1
the	1
serenity	1
around.	1
Careful	1
not	1
to	1
touch	1
him,	1
or	1
be	1
noticed	1
by	1
him,	1
he	1
yet	1
drew	1
near	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
stood	1
there.	1
Ahab	1
turned.	1
"Starbuck!"	1
"Sir."	1
"Oh,	1
Starbuck!	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
mild,	1
mild	1
wind,	1
and	1
a	1
mild	1
looking	1
sky.	1
On	1
such	1
a	1
day--very	1
much	1
such	1
a	1
sweetness	1
as	1
this--I	1
struck	1
my	1
first	1
whale--a	1
boy-harpooneer	1
of	1
eighteen!	1
Forty--forty--forty	1
years	1
ago!--ago!	1
Forty	1
years	1
of	1
continual	1
whaling!	1
forty	1
years	1
of	1
privation,	1
and	1
peril,	1
and	1
storm-time!	1
forty	1
years	1
on	1
the	1
pitiless	1
sea!	1
for	1
forty	1
years	1
has	1
Ahab	1
forsaken	1
the	1
peaceful	1
land,	1
for	1
forty	1
years	1
to	1
make	1
war	1
on	1
the	1
horrors	1
of	1
the	1
deep!	1
Aye	1
and	1
yes,	1
Starbuck,	1
out	1
of	1
those	1
forty	1
years	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
spent	1
three	1
ashore.	1
When	1
I	1
think	1
of	1
this	1
life	1
I	1
have	1
led;	1
the	1
desolation	1
of	1
solitude	1
it	1
has	1
been;	1
the	1
masoned,	1
walled-town	1
of	1
a	1
Captain's	1
exclusiveness,	1
which	1
admits	1
but	1
small	1
entrance	1
to	1
any	1
sympathy	1
from	1
the	1
green	1
country	1
without--oh,	1
weariness!	1
heaviness!	1
Guinea-coast	1
slavery	1
of	1
solitary	1
command!--when	1
I	1
think	1
of	1
all	1
this;	1
only	1
half-suspected,	1
not	1
so	1
keenly	1
known	1
to	1
me	1
before--and	1
how	1
for	1
forty	1
years	1
I	1
have	1
fed	1
upon	1
dry	1
salted	1
fare--fit	1
emblem	1
of	1
the	1
dry	1
nourishment	1
of	1
my	1
soil!--when	1
the	1
poorest	1
landsman	1
has	1
had	1
fresh	1
fruit	1
to	1
his	1
daily	1
hand,	1
and	1
broken	1
the	1
world's	1
fresh	1
bread	1
to	1
my	1
mouldy	1
crusts--away,	1
whole	1
oceans	1
away,	1
from	1
that	1
young	1
girl-wife	1
I	1
wedded	1
past	1
fifty,	1
and	1
sailed	1
for	1
Cape	1
Horn	1
the	1
next	1
day,	1
leaving	1
but	1
one	1
dent	1
in	1
my	1
marriage	1
pillow--wife?	1
wife?--rather	1
a	1
widow	1
with	1
her	1
husband	1
alive!	1
Aye,	1
I	1
widowed	1
that	1
poor	1
girl	1
when	1
I	1
married	1
her,	1
Starbuck;	1
and	1
then,	1
the	1
madness,	1
the	1
frenzy,	1
the	1
boiling	1
blood	1
and	1
the	1
smoking	1
brow,	1
with	1
which,	1
for	1
a	1
thousand	1
lowerings	1
old	1
Ahab	1
has	1
furiously,	1
foamingly	1
chased	1
his	1
prey--more	1
a	1
demon	1
than	1
a	1
man!--aye,	1
aye!	1
what	1
a	1
forty	1
years'	1
fool--fool--old	1
fool,	1
has	1
old	1
Ahab	1
been!	1
Why	1
this	1
strife	1
of	1
the	1
chase?	1
why	1
weary,	1
and	1
palsy	1
the	1
arm	1
at	1
the	1
oar,	1
and	1
the	1
iron,	1
and	1
the	1
lance?	1
how	1
the	1
richer	1
or	1
better	1
is	1
Ahab	1
now?	1
Behold.	1
Oh,	1
Starbuck!	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
hard,	1
that	1
with	1
this	1
weary	1
load	1
I	1
bear,	1
one	1
poor	1
leg	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
snatched	1
from	1
under	1
me?	1
Here,	1
brush	1
this	1
old	1
hair	1
aside;	1
it	1
blinds	1
me,	1
that	1
I	1
seem	1
to	1
weep.	1
Locks	1
so	1
grey	1
did	1
never	1
grow	1
but	1
from	1
out	1
some	1
ashes!	1
But	1
do	1
I	1
look	1
very	1
old,	1
so	1
very,	1
very	1
old,	1
Starbuck?	1
I	1
feel	1
deadly	1
faint,	1
bowed,	1
and	1
humped,	1
as	1
though	1
I	1
were	1
Adam,	1
staggering	1
beneath	1
the	1
piled	1
centuries	1
since	1
Paradise.	1
God!	1
God!	1
God!--crack	1
my	1
heart!--stave	1
my	1
brain!--mockery!	1
mockery!	1
bitter,	1
biting	1
mockery	1
of	1
grey	1
hairs,	1
have	1
I	1
lived	1
enough	1
joy	1
to	1
wear	1
ye;	1
and	1
seem	1
and	1
feel	1
thus	1
intolerably	1
old?	1
Close!	1
stand	1
close	1
to	1
me,	1
Starbuck;	1
let	1
me	1
look	1
into	1
a	1
human	1
eye;	1
it	1
is	1
better	1
than	1
to	1
gaze	1
into	1
sea	1
or	1
sky;	1
better	1
than	1
to	1
gaze	1
upon	1
God.	1
By	1
the	1
green	1
land;	1
by	1
the	1
bright	1
hearth-stone!	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
magic	1
glass,	1
man;	1
I	1
see	1
my	1
wife	1
and	1
my	1
child	1
in	1
thine	1
eye.	1
No,	1
no;	1
stay	1
on	1
board,	1
on	1
board!--lower	1
not	1
when	1
I	1
do;	1
when	1
branded	1
Ahab	1
gives	1
chase	1
to	1
Moby	1
Dick.	1
That	1
hazard	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
thine.	1
No,	1
no!	1
not	1
with	1
the	1
far	1
away	1
home	1
I	1
see	1
in	1
that	1
eye!"	1
"Oh,	1
my	1
Captain!	1
my	1
Captain!	1
noble	1
soul!	1
grand	1
old	1
heart,	1
after	1
all!	1
why	1
should	1
any	1
one	1
give	1
chase	1
to	1
that	1
hated	1
fish!	1
Away	1
with	1
me!	1
let	1
us	1
fly	1
these	1
deadly	1
waters!	1
let	1
us	1
home!	1
Wife	1
and	1
child,	1
too,	1
are	1
Starbuck's--wife	1
and	1
child	1
of	1
his	1
brotherly,	1
sisterly,	1
play-fellow	1
youth;	1
even	1
as	1
thine,	1
sir,	1
are	1
the	1
wife	1
and	1
child	1
of	1
thy	1
loving,	1
longing,	1
paternal	1
old	1
age!	1
Away!	1
let	1
us	1
away!--this	1
instant	1
let	1
me	1
alter	1
the	1
course!	1
How	1
cheerily,	1
how	1
hilariously,	1
O	1
my	1
Captain,	1
would	1
we	1
bowl	1
on	1
our	1
way	1
to	1
see	1
old	1
Nantucket	1
again!	1
I	1
think,	1
sir,	1
they	1
have	1
some	1
such	1
mild	1
blue	1
days,	1
even	1
as	1
this,	1
in	1
Nantucket."	1
"They	1
have,	1
they	1
have.	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
them--some	1
summer	1
days	1
in	1
the	1
morning.	1
About	1
this	1
time--yes,	1
it	1
is	1
his	1
noon	1
nap	1
now--the	1
boy	1
vivaciously	1
wakes;	1
sits	1
up	1
in	1
bed;	1
and	1
his	1
mother	1
tells	1
him	1
of	1
me,	1
of	1
cannibal	1
old	1
me;	1
how	1
I	1
am	1
abroad	1
upon	1
the	1
deep,	1
but	1
will	1
yet	1
come	1
back	1
to	1
dance	1
him	1
again."	1
"'Tis	1
my	1
Mary,	1
my	1
Mary	1
herself!	1
She	1
promised	1
that	1
my	1
boy,	1
every	1
morning,	1
should	1
be	1
carried	1
to	1
the	1
hill	1
to	1
catch	1
the	1
first	1
glimpse	1
of	1
his	1
father's	1
sail!	1
Yes,	1
yes!	1
no	1
more!	1
it	1
is	1
done!	1
we	1
head	1
for	1
Nantucket!	1
Come,	1
my	1
Captain,	1
study	1
out	1
the	1
course,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
away!	1
See,	1
see!	1
the	1
boy's	1
face	1
from	1
the	1
window!	1
the	1
boy's	1
hand	1
on	1
the	1
hill!"	1
But	1
Ahab's	1
glance	1
was	1
averted;	1
like	1
a	1
blighted	1
fruit	1
tree	1
he	1
shook,	1
and	1
cast	1
his	1
last,	1
cindered	1
apple	1
to	1
the	1
soil.	1
"What	1
is	1
it,	1
what	1
nameless,	1
inscrutable,	1
unearthly	1
thing	1
is	1
it;	1
what	1
cozening,	1
hidden	1
lord	1
and	1
master,	1
and	1
cruel,	1
remorseless	1
emperor	1
commands	1
me;	1
that	1
against	1
all	1
natural	1
lovings	1
and	1
longings,	1
I	1
so	1
keep	1
pushing,	1
and	1
crowding,	1
and	1
jamming	1
myself	1
on	1
all	1
the	1
time;	1
recklessly	1
making	1
me	1
ready	1
to	1
do	1
what	1
in	1
my	1
own	1
proper,	1
natural	1
heart,	1
I	1
durst	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
dare?	1
Is	1
Ahab,	1
Ahab?	1
Is	1
it	1
I,	1
God,	1
or	1
who,	1
that	1
lifts	1
this	1
arm?	1
But	1
if	1
the	1
great	1
sun	1
move	1
not	1
of	1
himself;	1
but	1
is	1
as	1
an	1
errand-boy	1
in	1
heaven;	1
nor	1
one	1
single	1
star	1
can	1
revolve,	1
but	1
by	1
some	1
invisible	1
power;	1
how	1
then	1
can	1
this	1
one	1
small	1
heart	1
beat;	1
this	1
one	1
small	1
brain	1
think	1
thoughts;	1
unless	1
God	1
does	1
that	1
beating,	1
does	1
that	1
thinking,	1
does	1
that	1
living,	1
and	1
not	1
I.	1
By	1
heaven,	1
man,	1
we	1
are	1
turned	1
round	1
and	1
round	1
in	1
this	1
world,	1
like	1
yonder	1
windlass,	1
and	1
Fate	1
is	1
the	1
handspike.	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
time,	1
lo!	1
that	1
smiling	1
sky,	1
and	1
this	1
unsounded	1
sea!	1
Look!	1
see	1
yon	1
Albicore!	1
who	1
put	1
it	1
into	1
him	1
to	1
chase	1
and	1
fang	1
that	1
flying-fish?	1
Where	1
do	1
murderers	1
go,	1
man!	1
Who's	1
to	1
doom,	1
when	1
the	1
judge	1
himself	1
is	1
dragged	1
to	1
the	1
bar?	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
mild,	1
mild	1
wind,	1
and	1
a	1
mild	1
looking	1
sky;	1
and	1
the	1
air	1
smells	1
now,	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
blew	1
from	1
a	1
far-away	1
meadow;	1
they	1
have	1
been	1
making	1
hay	1
somewhere	1
under	1
the	1
slopes	1
of	1
the	1
Andes,	1
Starbuck,	1
and	1
the	1
mowers	1
are	1
sleeping	1
among	1
the	1
new-mown	1
hay.	1
Sleeping?	1
Aye,	1
toil	1
we	1
how	1
we	1
may,	1
we	1
all	1
sleep	1
at	1
last	1
on	1
the	1
field.	1
Sleep?	1
Aye,	1
and	1
rust	1
amid	1
greenness;	1
as	1
last	1
year's	1
scythes	1
flung	1
down,	1
and	1
left	1
in	1
the	1
half-cut	1
swaths--Starbuck!"	1
But	1
blanched	1
to	1
a	1
corpse's	1
hue	1
with	1
despair,	1
the	1
Mate	1
had	1
stolen	1
away.	1
Ahab	1
crossed	1
the	1
deck	1
to	1
gaze	1
over	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side;	1
but	1
started	1
at	1
two	1
reflected,	1
fixed	1
eyes	1
in	1
the	1
water	1
there.	1
Fedallah	1
was	1
motionlessly	1
leaning	1
over	1
the	1
same	1
rail.	1
CHAPTER	1
133	1
The	1
Chase--First	1
Day.	1
That	1
night,	1
in	1
the	1
mid-watch,	1
when	1
the	1
old	1
man--as	1
his	1
wont	1
at	1
intervals--stepped	1
forth	1
from	1
the	1
scuttle	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
leaned,	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
his	1
pivot-hole,	1
he	1
suddenly	1
thrust	1
out	1
his	1
face	1
fiercely,	1
snuffing	1
up	1
the	1
sea	1
air	1
as	1
a	1
sagacious	1
ship's	1
dog	1
will,	1
in	1
drawing	1
nigh	1
to	1
some	1
barbarous	1
isle.	1
He	1
declared	1
that	1
a	1
whale	1
must	1
be	1
near.	1
Soon	1
that	1
peculiar	1
odor,	1
sometimes	1
to	1
a	1
great	1
distance	1
given	1
forth	1
by	1
the	1
living	1
sperm	1
whale,	1
was	1
palpable	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
watch;	1
nor	1
was	1
any	1
mariner	1
surprised	1
when,	1
after	1
inspecting	1
the	1
compass,	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
dog-vane,	1
and	1
then	1
ascertaining	1
the	1
precise	1
bearing	1
of	1
the	1
odor	1
as	1
nearly	1
as	1
possible,	1
Ahab	1
rapidly	1
ordered	1
the	1
ship's	1
course	1
to	1
be	1
slightly	1
altered,	1
and	1
the	1
sail	1
to	1
be	1
shortened.	1
The	1
acute	1
policy	1
dictating	1
these	1
movements	1
was	1
sufficiently	1
vindicated	1
at	1
daybreak,	1
by	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
a	1
long	1
sleek	1
on	1
the	1
sea	1
directly	1
and	1
lengthwise	1
ahead,	1
smooth	1
as	1
oil,	1
and	1
resembling	1
in	1
the	1
pleated	1
watery	1
wrinkles	1
bordering	1
it,	1
the	1
polished	1
metallic-like	1
marks	1
of	1
some	1
swift	1
tide-rip,	1
at	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
a	1
deep,	1
rapid	1
stream.	1
"Man	1
the	1
mast-heads!	1
Call	1
all	1
hands!"	1
Thundering	1
with	1
the	1
butts	1
of	1
three	1
clubbed	1
handspikes	1
on	1
the	1
forecastle	1
deck,	1
Daggoo	1
roused	1
the	1
sleepers	1
with	1
such	1
judgment	1
claps	1
that	1
they	1
seemed	1
to	1
exhale	1
from	1
the	1
scuttle,	1
so	1
instantaneously	1
did	1
they	1
appear	1
with	1
their	1
clothes	1
in	1
their	1
hands.	1
"What	1
d'ye	1
see?"	1
cried	1
Ahab,	1
flattening	1
his	1
face	1
to	1
the	1
sky.	1
"Nothing,	1
nothing	1
sir!"	1
was	1
the	1
sound	1
hailing	1
down	1
in	1
reply.	1
"T'gallant	1
sails!--stunsails!	1
alow	1
and	1
aloft,	1
and	1
on	1
both	1
sides!"	1
All	1
sail	1
being	1
set,	1
he	1
now	1
cast	1
loose	1
the	1
life-line,	1
reserved	1
for	1
swaying	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
main	1
royal-mast	1
head;	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
moments	1
they	1
were	1
hoisting	1
him	1
thither,	1
when,	1
while	1
but	1
two	1
thirds	1
of	1
the	1
way	1
aloft,	1
and	1
while	1
peering	1
ahead	1
through	1
the	1
horizontal	1
vacancy	1
between	1
the	1
main-top-sail	1
and	1
top-gallant-sail,	1
he	1
raised	1
a	1
gull-like	1
cry	1
in	1
the	1
air.	1
"There	1
she	1
blows!--there	1
she	1
blows!	1
A	1
hump	1
like	1
a	1
snow-hill!	1
It	1
is	1
Moby	1
Dick!"	1
Fired	1
by	1
the	1
cry	1
which	1
seemed	1
simultaneously	1
taken	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
three	1
look-outs,	1
the	1
men	1
on	1
deck	1
rushed	1
to	1
the	1
rigging	1
to	1
behold	1
the	1
famous	1
whale	1
they	1
had	1
so	1
long	1
been	1
pursuing.	1
Ahab	1
had	1
now	1
gained	1
his	1
final	1
perch,	1
some	1
feet	1
above	1
the	1
other	1
look-outs,	1
Tashtego	1
standing	1
just	1
beneath	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
cap	1
of	1
the	1
top-gallant-mast,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
Indian's	1
head	1
was	1
almost	1
on	1
a	1
level	1
with	1
Ahab's	1
heel.	1
From	1
this	1
height	1
the	1
whale	1
was	1
now	1
seen	1
some	1
mile	1
or	1
so	1
ahead,	1
at	1
every	1
roll	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
revealing	1
his	1
high	1
sparkling	1
hump,	1
and	1
regularly	1
jetting	1
his	1
silent	1
spout	1
into	1
the	1
air.	1
To	1
the	1
credulous	1
mariners	1
it	1
seemed	1
the	1
same	1
silent	1
spout	1
they	1
had	1
so	1
long	1
ago	1
beheld	1
in	1
the	1
moonlit	1
Atlantic	1
and	1
Indian	1
Oceans.	1
"And	1
did	1
none	1
of	1
ye	1
see	1
it	1
before?"	1
cried	1
Ahab,	1
hailing	1
the	1
perched	1
men	1
all	1
around	1
him.	1
"I	1
saw	1
him	1
almost	1
that	1
same	1
instant,	1
sir,	1
that	1
Captain	1
Ahab	1
did,	1
and	1
I	1
cried	1
out,"	1
said	1
Tashtego.	1
"Not	1
the	1
same	1
instant;	1
not	1
the	1
same--no,	1
the	1
doubloon	1
is	1
mine,	1
Fate	1
reserved	1
the	1
doubloon	1
for	1
me.	1
I	1
only;	1
none	1
of	1
ye	1
could	1
have	1
raised	1
the	1
White	1
Whale	1
first.	1
There	1
she	1
blows!--there	1
she	1
blows!--there	1
she	1
blows!	1
There	1
again!--there	1
again!"	1
he	1
cried,	1
in	1
long-drawn,	1
lingering,	1
methodic	1
tones,	1
attuned	1
to	1
the	1
gradual	1
prolongings	1
of	1
the	1
whale's	1
visible	1
jets.	1
"He's	1
going	1
to	1
sound!	1
In	1
stunsails!	1
Down	1
top-gallant-sails!	1
Stand	1
by	1
three	1
boats.	1
Mr.	1
Starbuck,	1
remember,	1
stay	1
on	1
board,	1
and	1
keep	1
the	1
ship.	1
Helm	1
there!	1
Luff,	1
luff	1
a	1
point!	1
So;	1
steady,	1
man,	1
steady!	1
There	1
go	1
flukes!	1
No,	1
no;	1
only	1
black	1
water!	1
All	1
ready	1
the	1
boats	1
there?	1
Stand	1
by,	1
stand	1
by!	1
Lower	1
me,	1
Mr.	1
Starbuck;	1
lower,	1
lower,--quick,	1
quicker!"	1
and	1
he	1
slid	1
through	1
the	1
air	1
to	1
the	1
deck.	1
"He	1
is	1
heading	1
straight	1
to	1
leeward,	1
sir,"	1
cried	1
Stubb,	1
"right	1
away	1
from	1
us;	1
cannot	1
have	1
seen	1
the	1
ship	1
yet."	1
"Be	1
dumb,	1
man!	1
Stand	1
by	1
the	1
braces!	1
Hard	1
down	1
the	1
helm!--brace	1
up!	1
Shiver	1
her!--shiver	1
her!--So;	1
well	1
that!	1
Boats,	1
boats!"	1
Soon	1
all	1
the	1
boats	1
but	1
Starbuck's	1
were	1
dropped;	1
all	1
the	1
boat-sails	1
set--all	1
the	1
paddles	1
plying;	1
with	1
rippling	1
swiftness,	1
shooting	1
to	1
leeward;	1
and	1
Ahab	1
heading	1
the	1
onset.	1
A	1
pale,	1
death-glimmer	1
lit	1
up	1
Fedallah's	1
sunken	1
eyes;	1
a	1
hideous	1
motion	1
gnawed	1
his	1
mouth.	1
Like	1
noiseless	1
nautilus	1
shells,	1
their	1
light	1
prows	1
sped	1
through	1
the	1
sea;	1
but	1
only	1
slowly	1
they	1
neared	1
the	1
foe.	1
As	1
they	1
neared	1
him,	1
the	1
ocean	1
grew	1
still	1
more	1
smooth;	1
seemed	1
drawing	1
a	1
carpet	1
over	1
its	1
waves;	1
seemed	1
a	1
noon-meadow,	1
so	1
serenely	1
it	1
spread.	1
At	1
length	1
the	1
breathless	1
hunter	1
came	1
so	1
nigh	1
his	1
seemingly	1
unsuspecting	1
prey,	1
that	1
his	1
entire	1
dazzling	1
hump	1
was	1
distinctly	1
visible,	1
sliding	1
along	1
the	1
sea	1
as	1
if	1
an	1
isolated	1
thing,	1
and	1
continually	1
set	1
in	1
a	1
revolving	1
ring	1
of	1
finest,	1
fleecy,	1
greenish	1
foam.	1
He	1
saw	1
the	1
vast,	1
involved	1
wrinkles	1
of	1
the	1
slightly	1
projecting	1
head	1
beyond.	1
Before	1
it,	1
far	1
out	1
on	1
the	1
soft	1
Turkish-rugged	1
waters,	1
went	1
the	1
glistening	1
white	1
shadow	1
from	1
his	1
broad,	1
milky	1
forehead,	1
a	1
musical	1
rippling	1
playfully	1
accompanying	1
the	1
shade;	1
and	1
behind,	1
the	1
blue	1
waters	1
interchangeably	1
flowed	1
over	1
into	1
the	1
moving	1
valley	1
of	1
his	1
steady	1
wake;	1
and	1
on	1
either	1
hand	1
bright	1
bubbles	1
arose	1
and	1
danced	1
by	1
his	1
side.	1
But	1
these	1
were	1
broken	1
again	1
by	1
the	1
light	1
toes	1
of	1
hundreds	1
of	1
gay	1
fowl	1
softly	1
feathering	1
the	1
sea,	1
alternate	1
with	1
their	1
fitful	1
flight;	1
and	1
like	1
to	1
some	1
flag-staff	1
rising	1
from	1
the	1
painted	1
hull	1
of	1
an	1
argosy,	1
the	1
tall	1
but	1
shattered	1
pole	1
of	1
a	1
recent	1
lance	1
projected	1
from	1
the	1
white	1
whale's	1
back;	1
and	1
at	1
intervals	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
cloud	1
of	1
soft-toed	1
fowls	1
hovering,	1
and	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
skimming	1
like	1
a	1
canopy	1
over	1
the	1
fish,	1
silently	1
perched	1
and	1
rocked	1
on	1
this	1
pole,	1
the	1
long	1
tail	1
feathers	1
streaming	1
like	1
pennons.	1
A	1
gentle	1
joyousness--a	1
mighty	1
mildness	1
of	1
repose	1
in	1
swiftness,	1
invested	1
the	1
gliding	1
whale.	1
Not	1
the	1
white	1
bull	1
Jupiter	1
swimming	1
away	1
with	1
ravished	1
Europa	1
clinging	1
to	1
his	1
graceful	1
horns;	1
his	1
lovely,	1
leering	1
eyes	1
sideways	1
intent	1
upon	1
the	1
maid;	1
with	1
smooth	1
bewitching	1
fleetness,	1
rippling	1
straight	1
for	1
the	1
nuptial	1
bower	1
in	1
Crete;	1
not	1
Jove,	1
not	1
that	1
great	1
majesty	1
Supreme!	1
did	1
surpass	1
the	1
glorified	1
White	1
Whale	1
as	1
he	1
so	1
divinely	1
swam.	1
On	1
each	1
soft	1
side--coincident	1
with	1
the	1
parted	1
swell,	1
that	1
but	1
once	1
leaving	1
him,	1
then	1
flowed	1
so	1
wide	1
away--on	1
each	1
bright	1
side,	1
the	1
whale	1
shed	1
off	1
enticings.	1
No	1
wonder	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
some	1
among	1
the	1
hunters	1
who	1
namelessly	1
transported	1
and	1
allured	1
by	1
all	1
this	1
serenity,	1
had	1
ventured	1
to	1
assail	1
it;	1
but	1
had	1
fatally	1
found	1
that	1
quietude	1
but	1
the	1
vesture	1
of	1
tornadoes.	1
Yet	1
calm,	1
enticing	1
calm,	1
oh,	1
whale!	1
thou	1
glidest	1
on,	1
to	1
all	1
who	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
eye	1
thee,	1
no	1
matter	1
how	1
many	1
in	1
that	1
same	1
way	1
thou	1
may'st	1
have	1
bejuggled	1
and	1
destroyed	1
before.	1
And	1
thus,	1
through	1
the	1
serene	1
tranquillities	1
of	1
the	1
tropical	1
sea,	1
among	1
waves	1
whose	1
hand-clappings	1
were	1
suspended	1
by	1
exceeding	1
rapture,	1
Moby	1
Dick	1
moved	1
on,	1
still	1
withholding	1
from	1
sight	1
the	1
full	1
terrors	1
of	1
his	1
submerged	1
trunk,	1
entirely	1
hiding	1
the	1
wrenched	1
hideousness	1
of	1
his	1
jaw.	1
But	1
soon	1
the	1
fore	1
part	1
of	1
him	1
slowly	1
rose	1
from	1
the	1
water;	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
his	1
whole	1
marbleized	1
body	1
formed	1
a	1
high	1
arch,	1
like	1
Virginia's	1
Natural	1
Bridge,	1
and	1
warningly	1
waving	1
his	1
bannered	1
flukes	1
in	1
the	1
air,	1
the	1
grand	1
god	1
revealed	1
himself,	1
sounded,	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
sight.	1
Hoveringly	1
halting,	1
and	1
dipping	1
on	1
the	1
wing,	1
the	1
white	1
sea-fowls	1
longingly	1
lingered	1
over	1
the	1
agitated	1
pool	1
that	1
he	1
left.	1
With	1
oars	1
apeak,	1
and	1
paddles	1
down,	1
the	1
sheets	1
of	1
their	1
sails	1
adrift,	1
the	1
three	1
boats	1
now	1
stilly	1
floated,	1
awaiting	1
Moby	1
Dick's	1
reappearance.	1
"An	1
hour,"	1
said	1
Ahab,	1
standing	1
rooted	1
in	1
his	1
boat's	1
stern;	1
and	1
he	1
gazed	1
beyond	1
the	1
whale's	1
place,	1
towards	1
the	1
dim	1
blue	1
spaces	1
and	1
wide	1
wooing	1
vacancies	1
to	1
leeward.	1
It	1
was	1
only	1
an	1
instant;	1
for	1
again	1
his	1
eyes	1
seemed	1
whirling	1
round	1
in	1
his	1
head	1
as	1
he	1
swept	1
the	1
watery	1
circle.	1
The	1
breeze	1
now	1
freshened;	1
the	1
sea	1
began	1
to	1
swell.	1
"The	1
birds!--the	1
birds!"	1
cried	1
Tashtego.	1
In	1
long	1
Indian	1
file,	1
as	1
when	1
herons	1
take	1
wing,	1
the	1
white	1
birds	1
were	1
now	1
all	1
flying	1
towards	1
Ahab's	1
boat;	1
and	1
when	1
within	1
a	1
few	1
yards	1
began	1
fluttering	1
over	1
the	1
water	1
there,	1
wheeling	1
round	1
and	1
round,	1
with	1
joyous,	1
expectant	1
cries.	1
Their	1
vision	1
was	1
keener	1
than	1
man's;	1
Ahab	1
could	1
discover	1
no	1
sign	1
in	1
the	1
sea.	1
But	1
suddenly	1
as	1
he	1
peered	1
down	1
and	1
down	1
into	1
its	1
depths,	1
he	1
profoundly	1
saw	1
a	1
white	1
living	1
spot	1
no	1
bigger	1
than	1
a	1
white	1
weasel,	1
with	1
wonderful	1
celerity	1
uprising,	1
and	1
magnifying	1
as	1
it	1
rose,	1
till	1
it	1
turned,	1
and	1
then	1
there	1
were	1
plainly	1
revealed	1
two	1
long	1
crooked	1
rows	1
of	1
white,	1
glistening	1
teeth,	1
floating	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
undiscoverable	1
bottom.	1
It	1
was	1
Moby	1
Dick's	1
open	1
mouth	1
and	1
scrolled	1
jaw;	1
his	1
vast,	1
shadowed	1
bulk	1
still	1
half	1
blending	1
with	1
the	1
blue	1
of	1
the	1
sea.	1
The	1
glittering	1
mouth	1
yawned	1
beneath	1
the	1
boat	1
like	1
an	1
open-doored	1
marble	1
tomb;	1
and	1
giving	1
one	1
sidelong	1
sweep	1
with	1
his	1
steering	1
oar,	1
Ahab	1
whirled	1
the	1
craft	1
aside	1
from	1
this	1
tremendous	1
apparition.	1
Then,	1
calling	1
upon	1
Fedallah	1
to	1
change	1
places	1
with	1
him,	1
went	1
forward	1
to	1
the	1
bows,	1
and	1
seizing	1
Perth's	1
harpoon,	1
commanded	1
his	1
crew	1
to	1
grasp	1
their	1
oars	1
and	1
stand	1
by	1
to	1
stern.	1
Now,	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
this	1
timely	1
spinning	1
round	1
the	1
boat	1
upon	1
its	1
axis,	1
its	1
bow,	1
by	1
anticipation,	1
was	1
made	1
to	1
face	1
the	1
whale's	1
head	1
while	1
yet	1
under	1
water.	1
But	1
as	1
if	1
perceiving	1
this	1
stratagem,	1
Moby	1
Dick,	1
with	1
that	1
malicious	1
intelligence	1
ascribed	1
to	1
him,	1
sidelingly	1
transplanted	1
himself,	1
as	1
it	1
were,	1
in	1
an	1
instant,	1
shooting	1
his	1
pleated	1
head	1
lengthwise	1
beneath	1
the	1
boat.	1
Through	1
and	1
through;	1
through	1
every	1
plank	1
and	1
each	1
rib,	1
it	1
thrilled	1
for	1
an	1
instant,	1
the	1
whale	1
obliquely	1
lying	1
on	1
his	1
back,	1
in	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
a	1
biting	1
shark,	1
slowly	1
and	1
feelingly	1
taking	1
its	1
bows	1
full	1
within	1
his	1
mouth,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
long,	1
narrow,	1
scrolled	1
lower	1
jaw	1
curled	1
high	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
open	1
air,	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
teeth	1
caught	1
in	1
a	1
row-lock.	1
The	1
bluish	1
pearl-white	1
of	1
the	1
inside	1
of	1
the	1
jaw	1
was	1
within	1
six	1
inches	1
of	1
Ahab's	1
head,	1
and	1
reached	1
higher	1
than	1
that.	1
In	1
this	1
attitude	1
the	1
White	1
Whale	1
now	1
shook	1
the	1
slight	1
cedar	1
as	1
a	1
mildly	1
cruel	1
cat	1
her	1
mouse.	1
With	1
unastonished	1
eyes	1
Fedallah	1
gazed,	1
and	1
crossed	1
his	1
arms;	1
but	1
the	1
tiger-yellow	1
crew	1
were	1
tumbling	1
over	1
each	1
other's	1
heads	1
to	1
gain	1
the	1
uttermost	1
stern.	1
And	1
now,	1
while	1
both	1
elastic	1
gunwales	1
were	1
springing	1
in	1
and	1
out,	1
as	1
the	1
whale	1
dallied	1
with	1
the	1
doomed	1
craft	1
in	1
this	1
devilish	1
way;	1
and	1
from	1
his	1
body	1
being	1
submerged	1
beneath	1
the	1
boat,	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
darted	1
at	1
from	1
the	1
bows,	1
for	1
the	1
bows	1
were	1
almost	1
inside	1
of	1
him,	1
as	1
it	1
were;	1
and	1
while	1
the	1
other	1
boats	1
involuntarily	1
paused,	1
as	1
before	1
a	1
quick	1
crisis	1
impossible	1
to	1
withstand,	1
then	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
monomaniac	1
Ahab,	1
furious	1
with	1
this	1
tantalizing	1
vicinity	1
of	1
his	1
foe,	1
which	1
placed	1
him	1
all	1
alive	1
and	1
helpless	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
jaws	1
he	1
hated;	1
frenzied	1
with	1
all	1
this,	1
he	1
seized	1
the	1
long	1
bone	1
with	1
his	1
naked	1
hands,	1
and	1
wildly	1
strove	1
to	1
wrench	1
it	1
from	1
its	1
gripe.	1
As	1
now	1
he	1
thus	1
vainly	1
strove,	1
the	1
jaw	1
slipped	1
from	1
him;	1
the	1
frail	1
gunwales	1
bent	1
in,	1
collapsed,	1
and	1
snapped,	1
as	1
both	1
jaws,	1
like	1
an	1
enormous	1
shears,	1
sliding	1
further	1
aft,	1
bit	1
the	1
craft	1
completely	1
in	1
twain,	1
and	1
locked	1
themselves	1
fast	1
again	1
in	1
the	1
sea,	1
midway	1
between	1
the	1
two	1
floating	1
wrecks.	1
These	1
floated	1
aside,	1
the	1
broken	1
ends	1
drooping,	1
the	1
crew	1
at	1
the	1
stern-wreck	1
clinging	1
to	1
the	1
gunwales,	1
and	1
striving	1
to	1
hold	1
fast	1
to	1
the	1
oars	1
to	1
lash	1
them	1
across.	1
At	1
that	1
preluding	1
moment,	1
ere	1
the	1
boat	1
was	1
yet	1
snapped,	1
Ahab,	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
perceive	1
the	1
whale's	1
intent,	1
by	1
the	1
crafty	1
upraising	1
of	1
his	1
head,	1
a	1
movement	1
that	1
loosed	1
his	1
hold	1
for	1
the	1
time;	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
his	1
hand	1
had	1
made	1
one	1
final	1
effort	1
to	1
push	1
the	1
boat	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
bite.	1
But	1
only	1
slipping	1
further	1
into	1
the	1
whale's	1
mouth,	1
and	1
tilting	1
over	1
sideways	1
as	1
it	1
slipped,	1
the	1
boat	1
had	1
shaken	1
off	1
his	1
hold	1
on	1
the	1
jaw;	1
spilled	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
it,	1
as	1
he	1
leaned	1
to	1
the	1
push;	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
fell	1
flat-faced	1
upon	1
the	1
sea.	1
Ripplingly	1
withdrawing	1
from	1
his	1
prey,	1
Moby	1
Dick	1
now	1
lay	1
at	1
a	1
little	1
distance,	1
vertically	1
thrusting	1
his	1
oblong	1
white	1
head	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
billows;	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
slowly	1
revolving	1
his	1
whole	1
spindled	1
body;	1
so	1
that	1
when	1
his	1
vast	1
wrinkled	1
forehead	1
rose--some	1
twenty	1
or	1
more	1
feet	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
water--the	1
now	1
rising	1
swells,	1
with	1
all	1
their	1
confluent	1
waves,	1
dazzlingly	1
broke	1
against	1
it;	1
vindictively	1
tossing	1
their	1
shivered	1
spray	1
still	1
higher	1
into	1
the	1
air.*	1
So,	1
in	1
a	1
gale,	1
the	1
but	1
half	1
baffled	1
Channel	1
billows	1
only	1
recoil	1
from	1
the	1
base	1
of	1
the	1
Eddystone,	1
triumphantly	1
to	1
overleap	1
its	1
summit	1
with	1
their	1
scud.	1
*This	1
motion	1
is	1
peculiar	1
to	1
the	1
sperm	1
whale.	1
It	1
receives	1
its	1
designation	1
(pitchpoling)	1
from	1
its	1
being	1
likened	1
to	1
that	1
preliminary	1
up-and-down	1
poise	1
of	1
the	1
whale-lance,	1
in	1
the	1
exercise	1
called	1
pitchpoling,	1
previously	1
described.	1
By	1
this	1
motion	1
the	1
whale	1
must	1
best	1
and	1
most	1
comprehensively	1
view	1
whatever	1
objects	1
may	1
be	1
encircling	1
him.	1
But	1
soon	1
resuming	1
his	1
horizontal	1
attitude,	1
Moby	1
Dick	1
swam	1
swiftly	1
round	1
and	1
round	1
the	1
wrecked	1
crew;	1
sideways	1
churning	1
the	1
water	1
in	1
his	1
vengeful	1
wake,	1
as	1
if	1
lashing	1
himself	1
up	1
to	1
still	1
another	1
and	1
more	1
deadly	1
assault.	1
The	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
splintered	1
boat	1
seemed	1
to	1
madden	1
him,	1
as	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
grapes	1
and	1
mulberries	1
cast	1
before	1
Antiochus's	1
elephants	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
Maccabees.	1
Meanwhile	1
Ahab	1
half	1
smothered	1
in	1
the	1
foam	1
of	1
the	1
whale's	1
insolent	1
tail,	1
and	1
too	1
much	1
of	1
a	1
cripple	1
to	1
swim,--though	1
he	1
could	1
still	1
keep	1
afloat,	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
whirlpool	1
as	1
that;	1
helpless	1
Ahab's	1
head	1
was	1
seen,	1
like	1
a	1
tossed	1
bubble	1
which	1
the	1
least	1
chance	1
shock	1
might	1
burst.	1
From	1
the	1
boat's	1
fragmentary	1
stern,	1
Fedallah	1
incuriously	1
and	1
mildly	1
eyed	1
him;	1
the	1
clinging	1
crew,	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
drifting	1
end,	1
could	1
not	1
succor	1
him;	1
more	1
than	1
enough	1
was	1
it	1
for	1
them	1
to	1
look	1
to	1
themselves.	1
For	1
so	1
revolvingly	1
appalling	1
was	1
the	1
White	1
Whale's	1
aspect,	1
and	1
so	1
planetarily	1
swift	1
the	1
ever-contracting	1
circles	1
he	1
made,	1
that	1
he	1
seemed	1
horizontally	1
swooping	1
upon	1
them.	1
And	1
though	1
the	1
other	1
boats,	1
unharmed,	1
still	1
hovered	1
hard	1
by;	1
still	1
they	1
dared	1
not	1
pull	1
into	1
the	1
eddy	1
to	1
strike,	1
lest	1
that	1
should	1
be	1
the	1
signal	1
for	1
the	1
instant	1
destruction	1
of	1
the	1
jeopardized	1
castaways,	1
Ahab	1
and	1
all;	1
nor	1
in	1
that	1
case	1
could	1
they	1
themselves	1
hope	1
to	1
escape.	1
With	1
straining	1
eyes,	1
then,	1
they	1
remained	1
on	1
the	1
outer	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
direful	1
zone,	1
whose	1
centre	1
had	1
now	1
become	1
the	1
old	1
man's	1
head.	1
Meantime,	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
all	1
this	1
had	1
been	1
descried	1
from	1
the	1
ship's	1
mast	1
heads;	1
and	1
squaring	1
her	1
yards,	1
she	1
had	1
borne	1
down	1
upon	1
the	1
scene;	1
and	1
was	1
now	1
so	1
nigh,	1
that	1
Ahab	1
in	1
the	1
water	1
hailed	1
her!--"Sail	1
on	1
the"--but	1
that	1
moment	1
a	1
breaking	1
sea	1
dashed	1
on	1
him	1
from	1
Moby	1
Dick,	1
and	1
whelmed	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
time.	1
But	1
struggling	1
out	1
of	1
it	1
again,	1
and	1
chancing	1
to	1
rise	1
on	1
a	1
towering	1
crest,	1
he	1
shouted,--"Sail	1
on	1
the	1
whale!--Drive	1
him	1
off!"	1
The	1
Pequod's	1
prows	1
were	1
pointed;	1
and	1
breaking	1
up	1
the	1
charmed	1
circle,	1
she	1
effectually	1
parted	1
the	1
white	1
whale	1
from	1
his	1
victim.	1
As	1
he	1
sullenly	1
swam	1
off,	1
the	1
boats	1
flew	1
to	1
the	1
rescue.	1
Dragged	1
into	1
Stubb's	1
boat	1
with	1
blood-shot,	1
blinded	1
eyes,	1
the	1
white	1
brine	1
caking	1
in	1
his	1
wrinkles;	1
the	1
long	1
tension	1
of	1
Ahab's	1
bodily	1
strength	1
did	1
crack,	1
and	1
helplessly	1
he	1
yielded	1
to	1
his	1
body's	1
doom:	1
for	1
a	1
time,	1
lying	1
all	1
crushed	1
in	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
Stubb's	1
boat,	1
like	1
one	1
trodden	1
under	1
foot	1
of	1
herds	1
of	1
elephants.	1
Far	1
inland,	1
nameless	1
wails	1
came	1
from	1
him,	1
as	1
desolate	1
sounds	1
from	1
out	1
ravines.	1
But	1
this	1
intensity	1
of	1
his	1
physical	1
prostration	1
did	1
but	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
more	1
abbreviate	1
it.	1
In	1
an	1
instant's	1
compass,	1
great	1
hearts	1
sometimes	1
condense	1
to	1
one	1
deep	1
pang,	1
the	1
sum	1
total	1
of	1
those	1
shallow	1
pains	1
kindly	1
diffused	1
through	1
feebler	1
men's	1
whole	1
lives.	1
And	1
so,	1
such	1
hearts,	1
though	1
summary	1
in	1
each	1
one	1
suffering;	1
still,	1
if	1
the	1
gods	1
decree	1
it,	1
in	1
their	1
life-time	1
aggregate	1
a	1
whole	1
age	1
of	1
woe,	1
wholly	1
made	1
up	1
of	1
instantaneous	1
intensities;	1
for	1
even	1
in	1
their	1
pointless	1
centres,	1
those	1
noble	1
natures	1
contain	1
the	1
entire	1
circumferences	1
of	1
inferior	1
souls.	1
"The	1
harpoon,"	1
said	1
Ahab,	1
half	1
way	1
rising,	1
and	1
draggingly	1
leaning	1
on	1
one	1
bended	1
arm--"is	1
it	1
safe?"	1
"Aye,	1
sir,	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
darted;	1
this	1
is	1
it,"	1
said	1
Stubb,	1
showing	1
it.	1
"Lay	1
it	1
before	1
me;--any	1
missing	1
men?"	1
"One,	1
two,	1
three,	1
four,	1
five;--there	1
were	1
five	1
oars,	1
sir,	1
and	1
here	1
are	1
five	1
men."	1
"That's	1
good.--Help	1
me,	1
man;	1
I	1
wish	1
to	1
stand.	1
So,	1
so,	1
I	1
see	1
him!	1
there!	1
there!	1
going	1
to	1
leeward	1
still;	1
what	1
a	1
leaping	1
spout!--Hands	1
off	1
from	1
me!	1
The	1
eternal	1
sap	1
runs	1
up	1
in	1
Ahab's	1
bones	1
again!	1
Set	1
the	1
sail;	1
out	1
oars;	1
the	1
helm!"	1
It	1
is	1
often	1
the	1
case	1
that	1
when	1
a	1
boat	1
is	1
stove,	1
its	1
crew,	1
being	1
picked	1
up	1
by	1
another	1
boat,	1
help	1
to	1
work	1
that	1
second	1
boat;	1
and	1
the	1
chase	1
is	1
thus	1
continued	1
with	1
what	1
is	1
called	1
double-banked	1
oars.	1
It	1
was	1
thus	1
now.	1
But	1
the	1
added	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
boat	1
did	1
not	1
equal	1
the	1
added	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
whale,	1
for	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
treble-banked	1
his	1
every	1
fin;	1
swimming	1
with	1
a	1
velocity	1
which	1
plainly	1
showed,	1
that	1
if	1
now,	1
under	1
these	1
circumstances,	1
pushed	1
on,	1
the	1
chase	1
would	1
prove	1
an	1
indefinitely	1
prolonged,	1
if	1
not	1
a	1
hopeless	1
one;	1
nor	1
could	1
any	1
crew	1
endure	1
for	1
so	1
long	1
a	1
period,	1
such	1
an	1
unintermitted,	1
intense	1
straining	1
at	1
the	1
oar;	1
a	1
thing	1
barely	1
tolerable	1
only	1
in	1
some	1
one	1
brief	1
vicissitude.	1
The	1
ship	1
itself,	1
then,	1
as	1
it	1
sometimes	1
happens,	1
offered	1
the	1
most	1
promising	1
intermediate	1
means	1
of	1
overtaking	1
the	1
chase.	1
Accordingly,	1
the	1
boats	1
now	1
made	1
for	1
her,	1
and	1
were	1
soon	1
swayed	1
up	1
to	1
their	1
cranes--the	1
two	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
wrecked	1
boat	1
having	1
been	1
previously	1
secured	1
by	1
her--and	1
then	1
hoisting	1
everything	1
to	1
her	1
side,	1
and	1
stacking	1
her	1
canvas	1
high	1
up,	1
and	1
sideways	1
outstretching	1
it	1
with	1
stun-sails,	1
like	1
the	1
double-jointed	1
wings	1
of	1
an	1
albatross;	1
the	1
Pequod	1
bore	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
leeward	1
wake	1
of	1
Moby-Dick.	1
At	1
the	1
well	1
known,	1
methodic	1
intervals,	1
the	1
whale's	1
glittering	1
spout	1
was	1
regularly	1
announced	1
from	1
the	1
manned	1
mast-heads;	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
reported	1
as	1
just	1
gone	1
down,	1
Ahab	1
would	1
take	1
the	1
time,	1
and	1
then	1
pacing	1
the	1
deck,	1
binnacle-watch	1
in	1
hand,	1
so	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
last	1
second	1
of	1
the	1
allotted	1
hour	1
expired,	1
his	1
voice	1
was	1
heard.--"Whose	1
is	1
the	1
doubloon	1
now?	1
D'ye	1
see	1
him?"	1
and	1
if	1
the	1
reply	1
was,	1
No,	1
sir!	1
straightway	1
he	1
commanded	1
them	1
to	1
lift	1
him	1
to	1
his	1
perch.	1
In	1
this	1
way	1
the	1
day	1
wore	1
on;	1
Ahab,	1
now	1
aloft	1
and	1
motionless;	1
anon,	1
unrestingly	1
pacing	1
the	1
planks.	1
As	1
he	1
was	1
thus	1
walking,	1
uttering	1
no	1
sound,	1
except	1
to	1
hail	1
the	1
men	1
aloft,	1
or	1
to	1
bid	1
them	1
hoist	1
a	1
sail	1
still	1
higher,	1
or	1
to	1
spread	1
one	1
to	1
a	1
still	1
greater	1
breadth--thus	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
pacing,	1
beneath	1
his	1
slouched	1
hat,	1
at	1
every	1
turn	1
he	1
passed	1
his	1
own	1
wrecked	1
boat,	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
dropped	1
upon	1
the	1
quarter-deck,	1
and	1
lay	1
there	1
reversed;	1
broken	1
bow	1
to	1
shattered	1
stern.	1
At	1
last	1
he	1
paused	1
before	1
it;	1
and	1
as	1
in	1
an	1
already	1
over-clouded	1
sky	1
fresh	1
troops	1
of	1
clouds	1
will	1
sometimes	1
sail	1
across,	1
so	1
over	1
the	1
old	1
man's	1
face	1
there	1
now	1
stole	1
some	1
such	1
added	1
gloom	1
as	1
this.	1
Stubb	1
saw	1
him	1
pause;	1
and	1
perhaps	1
intending,	1
not	1
vainly,	1
though,	1
to	1
evince	1
his	1
own	1
unabated	1
fortitude,	1
and	1
thus	1
keep	1
up	1
a	1
valiant	1
place	1
in	1
his	1
Captain's	1
mind,	1
he	1
advanced,	1
and	1
eyeing	1
the	1
wreck	1
exclaimed--"The	1
thistle	1
the	1
ass	1
refused;	1
it	1
pricked	1
his	1
mouth	1
too	1
keenly,	1
sir;	1
ha!	1
ha!"	1
"What	1
soulless	1
thing	1
is	1
this	1
that	1
laughs	1
before	1
a	1
wreck?	1
Man,	1
man!	1
did	1
I	1
not	1
know	1
thee	1
brave	1
as	1
fearless	1
fire	1
(and	1
as	1
mechanical)	1
I	1
could	1
swear	1
thou	1
wert	1
a	1
poltroon.	1
Groan	1
nor	1
laugh	1
should	1
be	1
heard	1
before	1
a	1
wreck."	1
"Aye,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
Starbuck	1
drawing	1
near,	1
"'tis	1
a	1
solemn	1
sight;	1
an	1
omen,	1
and	1
an	1
ill	1
one."	1
"Omen?	1
omen?--the	1
dictionary!	1
If	1
the	1
gods	1
think	1
to	1
speak	1
outright	1
to	1
man,	1
they	1
will	1
honourably	1
speak	1
outright;	1
not	1
shake	1
their	1
heads,	1
and	1
give	1
an	1
old	1
wives'	1
darkling	1
hint.--Begone!	1
Ye	1
two	1
are	1
the	1
opposite	1
poles	1
of	1
one	1
thing;	1
Starbuck	1
is	1
Stubb	1
reversed,	1
and	1
Stubb	1
is	1
Starbuck;	1
and	1
ye	1
two	1
are	1
all	1
mankind;	1
and	1
Ahab	1
stands	1
alone	1
among	1
the	1
millions	1
of	1
the	1
peopled	1
earth,	1
nor	1
gods	1
nor	1
men	1
his	1
neighbors!	1
Cold,	1
cold--I	1
shiver!--How	1
now?	1
Aloft	1
there!	1
D'ye	1
see	1
him?	1
Sing	1
out	1
for	1
every	1
spout,	1
though	1
he	1
spout	1
ten	1
times	1
a	1
second!"	1
The	1
day	1
was	1
nearly	1
done;	1
only	1
the	1
hem	1
of	1
his	1
golden	1
robe	1
was	1
rustling.	1
Soon,	1
it	1
was	1
almost	1
dark,	1
but	1
the	1
look-out	1
men	1
still	1
remained	1
unset.	1
"Can't	1
see	1
the	1
spout	1
now,	1
sir;--too	1
dark"--cried	1
a	1
voice	1
from	1
the	1
air.	1
"How	1
heading	1
when	1
last	1
seen?"	1
"As	1
before,	1
sir,--straight	1
to	1
leeward."	1
"Good!	1
he	1
will	1
travel	1
slower	1
now	1
'tis	1
night.	1
Down	1
royals	1
and	1
top-gallant	1
stun-sails,	1
Mr.	1
Starbuck.	1
We	1
must	1
not	1
run	1
over	1
him	1
before	1
morning;	1
he's	1
making	1
a	1
passage	1
now,	1
and	1
may	1
heave-to	1
a	1
while.	1
Helm	1
there!	1
keep	1
her	1
full	1
before	1
the	1
wind!--Aloft!	1
come	1
down!--Mr.	1
Stubb,	1
send	1
a	1
fresh	1
hand	1
to	1
the	1
fore-mast	1
head,	1
and	1
see	1
it	1
manned	1
till	1
morning."--Then	1
advancing	1
towards	1
the	1
doubloon	1
in	1
the	1
main-mast--"Men,	1
this	1
gold	1
is	1
mine,	1
for	1
I	1
earned	1
it;	1
but	1
I	1
shall	1
let	1
it	1
abide	1
here	1
till	1
the	1
White	1
Whale	1
is	1
dead;	1
and	1
then,	1
whosoever	1
of	1
ye	1
first	1
raises	1
him,	1
upon	1
the	1
day	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
killed,	1
this	1
gold	1
is	1
that	1
man's;	1
and	1
if	1
on	1
that	1
day	1
I	1
shall	1
again	1
raise	1
him,	1
then,	1
ten	1
times	1
its	1
sum	1
shall	1
be	1
divided	1
among	1
all	1
of	1
ye!	1
Away	1
now!--the	1
deck	1
is	1
thine,	1
sir!"	1
And	1
so	1
saying,	1
he	1
placed	1
himself	1
half	1
way	1
within	1
the	1
scuttle,	1
and	1
slouching	1
his	1
hat,	1
stood	1
there	1
till	1
dawn,	1
except	1
when	1
at	1
intervals	1
rousing	1
himself	1
to	1
see	1
how	1
the	1
night	1
wore	1
on.	1
CHAPTER	1
134	1
The	1
Chase--Second	1
Day.	1
At	1
day-break,	1
the	1
three	1
mast-heads	1
were	1
punctually	1
manned	1
afresh.	1
"D'ye	1
see	1
him?"	1
cried	1
Ahab	1
after	1
allowing	1
a	1
little	1
space	1
for	1
the	1
light	1
to	1
spread.	1
"See	1
nothing,	1
sir."	1
"Turn	1
up	1
all	1
hands	1
and	1
make	1
sail!	1
he	1
travels	1
faster	1
than	1
I	1
thought	1
for;--the	1
top-gallant	1
sails!--aye,	1
they	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
kept	1
on	1
her	1
all	1
night.	1
But	1
no	1
matter--'tis	1
but	1
resting	1
for	1
the	1
rush."	1
Here	1
be	1
it	1
said,	1
that	1
this	1
pertinacious	1
pursuit	1
of	1
one	1
particular	1
whale,	1
continued	1
through	1
day	1
into	1
night,	1
and	1
through	1
night	1
into	1
day,	1
is	1
a	1
thing	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
unprecedented	1
in	1
the	1
South	1
sea	1
fishery.	1
For	1
such	1
is	1
the	1
wonderful	1
skill,	1
prescience	1
of	1
experience,	1
and	1
invincible	1
confidence	1
acquired	1
by	1
some	1
great	1
natural	1
geniuses	1
among	1
the	1
Nantucket	1
commanders;	1
that	1
from	1
the	1
simple	1
observation	1
of	1
a	1
whale	1
when	1
last	1
descried,	1
they	1
will,	1
under	1
certain	1
given	1
circumstances,	1
pretty	1
accurately	1
foretell	1
both	1
the	1
direction	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
will	1
continue	1
to	1
swim	1
for	1
a	1
time,	1
while	1
out	1
of	1
sight,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
his	1
probable	1
rate	1
of	1
progression	1
during	1
that	1
period.	1
And,	1
in	1
these	1
cases,	1
somewhat	1
as	1
a	1
pilot,	1
when	1
about	1
losing	1
sight	1
of	1
a	1
coast,	1
whose	1
general	1
trending	1
he	1
well	1
knows,	1
and	1
which	1
he	1
desires	1
shortly	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
again,	1
but	1
at	1
some	1
further	1
point;	1
like	1
as	1
this	1
pilot	1
stands	1
by	1
his	1
compass,	1
and	1
takes	1
the	1
precise	1
bearing	1
of	1
the	1
cape	1
at	1
present	1
visible,	1
in	1
order	1
the	1
more	1
certainly	1
to	1
hit	1
aright	1
the	1
remote,	1
unseen	1
headland,	1
eventually	1
to	1
be	1
visited:	1
so	1
does	1
the	1
fisherman,	1
at	1
his	1
compass,	1
with	1
the	1
whale;	1
for	1
after	1
being	1
chased,	1
and	1
diligently	1
marked,	1
through	1
several	1
hours	1
of	1
daylight,	1
then,	1
when	1
night	1
obscures	1
the	1
fish,	1
the	1
creature's	1
future	1
wake	1
through	1
the	1
darkness	1
is	1
almost	1
as	1
established	1
to	1
the	1
sagacious	1
mind	1
of	1
the	1
hunter,	1
as	1
the	1
pilot's	1
coast	1
is	1
to	1
him.	1
So	1
that	1
to	1
this	1
hunter's	1
wondrous	1
skill,	1
the	1
proverbial	1
evanescence	1
of	1
a	1
thing	1
writ	1
in	1
water,	1
a	1
wake,	1
is	1
to	1
all	1
desired	1
purposes	1
well	1
nigh	1
as	1
reliable	1
as	1
the	1
steadfast	1
land.	1
And	1
as	1
the	1
mighty	1
iron	1
Leviathan	1
of	1
the	1
modern	1
railway	1
is	1
so	1
familiarly	1
known	1
in	1
its	1
every	1
pace,	1
that,	1
with	1
watches	1
in	1
their	1
hands,	1
men	1
time	1
his	1
rate	1
as	1
doctors	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
baby's	1
pulse;	1
and	1
lightly	1
say	1
of	1
it,	1
the	1
up	1
train	1
or	1
the	1
down	1
train	1
will	1
reach	1
such	1
or	1
such	1
a	1
spot,	1
at	1
such	1
or	1
such	1
an	1
hour;	1
even	1
so,	1
almost,	1
there	1
are	1
occasions	1
when	1
these	1
Nantucketers	1
time	1
that	1
other	1
Leviathan	1
of	1
the	1
deep,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
observed	1
humor	1
of	1
his	1
speed;	1
and	1
say	1
to	1
themselves,	1
so	1
many	1
hours	1
hence	1
this	1
whale	1
will	1
have	1
gone	1
two	1
hundred	1
miles,	1
will	1
have	1
about	1
reached	1
this	1
or	1
that	1
degree	1
of	1
latitude	1
or	1
longitude.	1
But	1
to	1
render	1
this	1
acuteness	1
at	1
all	1
successful	1
in	1
the	1
end,	1
the	1
wind	1
and	1
the	1
sea	1
must	1
be	1
the	1
whaleman's	1
allies;	1
for	1
of	1
what	1
present	1
avail	1
to	1
the	1
becalmed	1
or	1
windbound	1
mariner	1
is	1
the	1
skill	1
that	1
assures	1
him	1
he	1
is	1
exactly	1
ninety-three	1
leagues	1
and	1
a	1
quarter	1
from	1
his	1
port?	1
Inferable	1
from	1
these	1
statements,	1
are	1
many	1
collateral	1
subtile	1
matters	1
touching	1
the	1
chase	1
of	1
whales.	1
The	1
ship	1
tore	1
on;	1
leaving	1
such	1
a	1
furrow	1
in	1
the	1
sea	1
as	1
when	1
a	1
cannon-ball,	1
missent,	1
becomes	1
a	1
plough-share	1
and	1
turns	1
up	1
the	1
level	1
field.	1
"By	1
salt	1
and	1
hemp!"	1
cried	1
Stubb,	1
"but	1
this	1
swift	1
motion	1
of	1
the	1
deck	1
creeps	1
up	1
one's	1
legs	1
and	1
tingles	1
at	1
the	1
heart.	1
This	1
ship	1
and	1
I	1
are	1
two	1
brave	1
fellows!--Ha,	1
ha!	1
Some	1
one	1
take	1
me	1
up,	1
and	1
launch	1
me,	1
spine-wise,	1
on	1
the	1
sea,--for	1
by	1
live-oaks!	1
my	1
spine's	1
a	1
keel.	1
Ha,	1
ha!	1
we	1
go	1
the	1
gait	1
that	1
leaves	1
no	1
dust	1
behind!"	1
"There	1
she	1
blows--she	1
blows!--she	1
blows!--right	1
ahead!"	1
was	1
now	1
the	1
mast-head	1
cry.	1
"Aye,	1
aye!"	1
cried	1
Stubb,	1
"I	1
knew	1
it--ye	1
can't	1
escape--blow	1
on	1
and	1
split	1
your	1
spout,	1
O	1
whale!	1
the	1
mad	1
fiend	1
himself	1
is	1
after	1
ye!	1
blow	1
your	1
trump--blister	1
your	1
lungs!--Ahab	1
will	1
dam	1
off	1
your	1
blood,	1
as	1
a	1
miller	1
shuts	1
his	1
watergate	1
upon	1
the	1
stream!"	1
And	1
Stubb	1
did	1
but	1
speak	1
out	1
for	1
well	1
nigh	1
all	1
that	1
crew.	1
The	1
frenzies	1
of	1
the	1
chase	1
had	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
worked	1
them	1
bubblingly	1
up,	1
like	1
old	1
wine	1
worked	1
anew.	1
Whatever	1
pale	1
fears	1
and	1
forebodings	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
might	1
have	1
felt	1
before;	1
these	1
were	1
not	1
only	1
now	1
kept	1
out	1
of	1
sight	1
through	1
the	1
growing	1
awe	1
of	1
Ahab,	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
broken	1
up,	1
and	1
on	1
all	1
sides	1
routed,	1
as	1
timid	1
prairie	1
hares	1
that	1
scatter	1
before	1
the	1
bounding	1
bison.	1
The	1
hand	1
of	1
Fate	1
had	1
snatched	1
all	1
their	1
souls;	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
stirring	1
perils	1
of	1
the	1
previous	1
day;	1
the	1
rack	1
of	1
the	1
past	1
night's	1
suspense;	1
the	1
fixed,	1
unfearing,	1
blind,	1
reckless	1
way	1
in	1
which	1
their	1
wild	1
craft	1
went	1
plunging	1
towards	1
its	1
flying	1
mark;	1
by	1
all	1
these	1
things,	1
their	1
hearts	1
were	1
bowled	1
along.	1
The	1
wind	1
that	1
made	1
great	1
bellies	1
of	1
their	1
sails,	1
and	1
rushed	1
the	1
vessel	1
on	1
by	1
arms	1
invisible	1
as	1
irresistible;	1
this	1
seemed	1
the	1
symbol	1
of	1
that	1
unseen	1
agency	1
which	1
so	1
enslaved	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
race.	1
They	1
were	1
one	1
man,	1
not	1
thirty.	1
For	1
as	1
the	1
one	1
ship	1
that	1
held	1
them	1
all;	1
though	1
it	1
was	1
put	1
together	1
of	1
all	1
contrasting	1
things--oak,	1
and	1
maple,	1
and	1
pine	1
wood;	1
iron,	1
and	1
pitch,	1
and	1
hemp--yet	1
all	1
these	1
ran	1
into	1
each	1
other	1
in	1
the	1
one	1
concrete	1
hull,	1
which	1
shot	1
on	1
its	1
way,	1
both	1
balanced	1
and	1
directed	1
by	1
the	1
long	1
central	1
keel;	1
even	1
so,	1
all	1
the	1
individualities	1
of	1
the	1
crew,	1
this	1
man's	1
valor,	1
that	1
man's	1
fear;	1
guilt	1
and	1
guiltiness,	1
all	1
varieties	1
were	1
welded	1
into	1
oneness,	1
and	1
were	1
all	1
directed	1
to	1
that	1
fatal	1
goal	1
which	1
Ahab	1
their	1
one	1
lord	1
and	1
keel	1
did	1
point	1
to.	1
The	1
rigging	1
lived.	1
The	1
mast-heads,	1
like	1
the	1
tops	1
of	1
tall	1
palms,	1
were	1
outspreadingly	1
tufted	1
with	1
arms	1
and	1
legs.	1
Clinging	1
to	1
a	1
spar	1
with	1
one	1
hand,	1
some	1
reached	1
forth	1
the	1
other	1
with	1
impatient	1
wavings;	1
others,	1
shading	1
their	1
eyes	1
from	1
the	1
vivid	1
sunlight,	1
sat	1
far	1
out	1
on	1
the	1
rocking	1
yards;	1
all	1
the	1
spars	1
in	1
full	1
bearing	1
of	1
mortals,	1
ready	1
and	1
ripe	1
for	1
their	1
fate.	1
Ah!	1
how	1
they	1
still	1
strove	1
through	1
that	1
infinite	1
blueness	1
to	1
seek	1
out	1
the	1
thing	1
that	1
might	1
destroy	1
them!	1
"Why	1
sing	1
ye	1
not	1
out	1
for	1
him,	1
if	1
ye	1
see	1
him?"	1
cried	1
Ahab,	1
when,	1
after	1
the	1
lapse	1
of	1
some	1
minutes	1
since	1
the	1
first	1
cry,	1
no	1
more	1
had	1
been	1
heard.	1
"Sway	1
me	1
up,	1
men;	1
ye	1
have	1
been	1
deceived;	1
not	1
Moby	1
Dick	1
casts	1
one	1
odd	1
jet	1
that	1
way,	1
and	1
then	1
disappears."	1
It	1
was	1
even	1
so;	1
in	1
their	1
headlong	1
eagerness,	1
the	1
men	1
had	1
mistaken	1
some	1
other	1
thing	1
for	1
the	1
whale-spout,	1
as	1
the	1
event	1
itself	1
soon	1
proved;	1
for	1
hardly	1
had	1
Ahab	1
reached	1
his	1
perch;	1
hardly	1
was	1
the	1
rope	1
belayed	1
to	1
its	1
pin	1
on	1
deck,	1
when	1
he	1
struck	1
the	1
key-note	1
to	1
an	1
orchestra,	1
that	1
made	1
the	1
air	1
vibrate	1
as	1
with	1
the	1
combined	1
discharges	1
of	1
rifles.	1
The	1
triumphant	1
halloo	1
of	1
thirty	1
buckskin	1
lungs	1
was	1
heard,	1
as--much	1
nearer	1
to	1
the	1
ship	1
than	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
imaginary	1
jet,	1
less	1
than	1
a	1
mile	1
ahead--Moby	1
Dick	1
bodily	1
burst	1
into	1
view!	1
For	1
not	1
by	1
any	1
calm	1
and	1
indolent	1
spoutings;	1
not	1
by	1
the	1
peaceable	1
gush	1
of	1
that	1
mystic	1
fountain	1
in	1
his	1
head,	1
did	1
the	1
White	1
Whale	1
now	1
reveal	1
his	1
vicinity;	1
but	1
by	1
the	1
far	1
more	1
wondrous	1
phenomenon	1
of	1
breaching.	1
Rising	1
with	1
his	1
utmost	1
velocity	1
from	1
the	1
furthest	1
depths,	1
the	1
Sperm	1
Whale	1
thus	1
booms	1
his	1
entire	1
bulk	1
into	1
the	1
pure	1
element	1
of	1
air,	1
and	1
piling	1
up	1
a	1
mountain	1
of	1
dazzling	1
foam,	1
shows	1
his	1
place	1
to	1
the	1
distance	1
of	1
seven	1
miles	1
and	1
more.	1
In	1
those	1
moments,	1
the	1
torn,	1
enraged	1
waves	1
he	1
shakes	1
off,	1
seem	1
his	1
mane;	1
in	1
some	1
cases,	1
this	1
breaching	1
is	1
his	1
act	1
of	1
defiance.	1
"There	1
she	1
breaches!	1
there	1
she	1
breaches!"	1
was	1
the	1
cry,	1
as	1
in	1
his	1
immeasurable	1
bravadoes	1
the	1
White	1
Whale	1
tossed	1
himself	1
salmon-like	1
to	1
Heaven.	1
So	1
suddenly	1
seen	1
in	1
the	1
blue	1
plain	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
relieved	1
against	1
the	1
still	1
bluer	1
margin	1
of	1
the	1
sky,	1
the	1
spray	1
that	1
he	1
raised,	1
for	1
the	1
moment,	1
intolerably	1
glittered	1
and	1
glared	1
like	1
a	1
glacier;	1
and	1
stood	1
there	1
gradually	1
fading	1
and	1
fading	1
away	1
from	1
its	1
first	1
sparkling	1
intensity,	1
to	1
the	1
dim	1
mistiness	1
of	1
an	1
advancing	1
shower	1
in	1
a	1
vale.	1
"Aye,	1
breach	1
your	1
last	1
to	1
the	1
sun,	1
Moby	1
Dick!"	1
cried	1
Ahab,	1
"thy	1
hour	1
and	1
thy	1
harpoon	1
are	1
at	1
hand!--Down!	1
down	1
all	1
of	1
ye,	1
but	1
one	1
man	1
at	1
the	1
fore.	1
The	1
boats!--stand	1
by!"	1
Unmindful	1
of	1
the	1
tedious	1
rope-ladders	1
of	1
the	1
shrouds,	1
the	1
men,	1
like	1
shooting	1
stars,	1
slid	1
to	1
the	1
deck,	1
by	1
the	1
isolated	1
backstays	1
and	1
halyards;	1
while	1
Ahab,	1
less	1
dartingly,	1
but	1
still	1
rapidly	1
was	1
dropped	1
from	1
his	1
perch.	1
"Lower	1
away,"	1
he	1
cried,	1
so	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
reached	1
his	1
boat--a	1
spare	1
one,	1
rigged	1
the	1
afternoon	1
previous.	1
"Mr.	1
Starbuck,	1
the	1
ship	1
is	1
thine--keep	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
boats,	1
but	1
keep	1
near	1
them.	1
Lower,	1
all!"	1
As	1
if	1
to	1
strike	1
a	1
quick	1
terror	1
into	1
them,	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
being	1
the	1
first	1
assailant	1
himself,	1
Moby	1
Dick	1
had	1
turned,	1
and	1
was	1
now	1
coming	1
for	1
the	1
three	1
crews.	1
Ahab's	1
boat	1
was	1
central;	1
and	1
cheering	1
his	1
men,	1
he	1
told	1
them	1
he	1
would	1
take	1
the	1
whale	1
head-and-head,--that	1
is,	1
pull	1
straight	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
forehead,--a	1
not	1
uncommon	1
thing;	1
for	1
when	1
within	1
a	1
certain	1
limit,	1
such	1
a	1
course	1
excludes	1
the	1
coming	1
onset	1
from	1
the	1
whale's	1
sidelong	1
vision.	1
But	1
ere	1
that	1
close	1
limit	1
was	1
gained,	1
and	1
while	1
yet	1
all	1
three	1
boats	1
were	1
plain	1
as	1
the	1
ship's	1
three	1
masts	1
to	1
his	1
eye;	1
the	1
White	1
Whale	1
churning	1
himself	1
into	1
furious	1
speed,	1
almost	1
in	1
an	1
instant	1
as	1
it	1
were,	1
rushing	1
among	1
the	1
boats	1
with	1
open	1
jaws,	1
and	1
a	1
lashing	1
tail,	1
offered	1
appalling	1
battle	1
on	1
every	1
side;	1
and	1
heedless	1
of	1
the	1
irons	1
darted	1
at	1
him	1
from	1
every	1
boat,	1
seemed	1
only	1
intent	1
on	1
annihilating	1
each	1
separate	1
plank	1
of	1
which	1
those	1
boats	1
were	1
made.	1
But	1
skilfully	1
manoeuvred,	1
incessantly	1
wheeling	1
like	1
trained	1
chargers	1
in	1
the	1
field;	1
the	1
boats	1
for	1
a	1
while	1
eluded	1
him;	1
though,	1
at	1
times,	1
but	1
by	1
a	1
plank's	1
breadth;	1
while	1
all	1
the	1
time,	1
Ahab's	1
unearthly	1
slogan	1
tore	1
every	1
other	1
cry	1
but	1
his	1
to	1
shreds.	1
But	1
at	1
last	1
in	1
his	1
untraceable	1
evolutions,	1
the	1
White	1
Whale	1
so	1
crossed	1
and	1
recrossed,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
thousand	1
ways	1
entangled	1
the	1
slack	1
of	1
the	1
three	1
lines	1
now	1
fast	1
to	1
him,	1
that	1
they	1
foreshortened,	1
and,	1
of	1
themselves,	1
warped	1
the	1
devoted	1
boats	1
towards	1
the	1
planted	1
irons	1
in	1
him;	1
though	1
now	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
the	1
whale	1
drew	1
aside	1
a	1
little,	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
rally	1
for	1
a	1
more	1
tremendous	1
charge.	1
Seizing	1
that	1
opportunity,	1
Ahab	1
first	1
paid	1
out	1
more	1
line:	1
and	1
then	1
was	1
rapidly	1
hauling	1
and	1
jerking	1
in	1
upon	1
it	1
again--hoping	1
that	1
way	1
to	1
disencumber	1
it	1
of	1
some	1
snarls--when	1
lo!--a	1
sight	1
more	1
savage	1
than	1
the	1
embattled	1
teeth	1
of	1
sharks!	1
Caught	1
and	1
twisted--corkscrewed	1
in	1
the	1
mazes	1
of	1
the	1
line,	1
loose	1
harpoons	1
and	1
lances,	1
with	1
all	1
their	1
bristling	1
barbs	1
and	1
points,	1
came	1
flashing	1
and	1
dripping	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
chocks	1
in	1
the	1
bows	1
of	1
Ahab's	1
boat.	1
Only	1
one	1
thing	1
could	1
be	1
done.	1
Seizing	1
the	1
boat-knife,	1
he	1
critically	1
reached	1
within--through--and	1
then,	1
without--the	1
rays	1
of	1
steel;	1
dragged	1
in	1
the	1
line	1
beyond,	1
passed	1
it,	1
inboard,	1
to	1
the	1
bowsman,	1
and	1
then,	1
twice	1
sundering	1
the	1
rope	1
near	1
the	1
chocks--dropped	1
the	1
intercepted	1
fagot	1
of	1
steel	1
into	1
the	1
sea;	1
and	1
was	1
all	1
fast	1
again.	1
That	1
instant,	1
the	1
White	1
Whale	1
made	1
a	1
sudden	1
rush	1
among	1
the	1
remaining	1
tangles	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
lines;	1
by	1
so	1
doing,	1
irresistibly	1
dragged	1
the	1
more	1
involved	1
boats	1
of	1
Stubb	1
and	1
Flask	1
towards	1
his	1
flukes;	1
dashed	1
them	1
together	1
like	1
two	1
rolling	1
husks	1
on	1
a	1
surf-beaten	1
beach,	1
and	1
then,	1
diving	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
sea,	1
disappeared	1
in	1
a	1
boiling	1
maelstrom,	1
in	1
which,	1
for	1
a	1
space,	1
the	1
odorous	1
cedar	1
chips	1
of	1
the	1
wrecks	1
danced	1
round	1
and	1
round,	1
like	1
the	1
grated	1
nutmeg	1
in	1
a	1
swiftly	1
stirred	1
bowl	1
of	1
punch.	1
While	1
the	1
two	1
crews	1
were	1
yet	1
circling	1
in	1
the	1
waters,	1
reaching	1
out	1
after	1
the	1
revolving	1
line-tubs,	1
oars,	1
and	1
other	1
floating	1
furniture,	1
while	1
aslope	1
little	1
Flask	1
bobbed	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
like	1
an	1
empty	1
vial,	1
twitching	1
his	1
legs	1
upwards	1
to	1
escape	1
the	1
dreaded	1
jaws	1
of	1
sharks;	1
and	1
Stubb	1
was	1
lustily	1
singing	1
out	1
for	1
some	1
one	1
to	1
ladle	1
him	1
up;	1
and	1
while	1
the	1
old	1
man's	1
line--now	1
parting--admitted	1
of	1
his	1
pulling	1
into	1
the	1
creamy	1
pool	1
to	1
rescue	1
whom	1
he	1
could;--in	1
that	1
wild	1
simultaneousness	1
of	1
a	1
thousand	1
concreted	1
perils,--Ahab's	1
yet	1
unstricken	1
boat	1
seemed	1
drawn	1
up	1
towards	1
Heaven	1
by	1
invisible	1
wires,--as,	1
arrow-like,	1
shooting	1
perpendicularly	1
from	1
the	1
sea,	1
the	1
White	1
Whale	1
dashed	1
his	1
broad	1
forehead	1
against	1
its	1
bottom,	1
and	1
sent	1
it,	1
turning	1
over	1
and	1
over,	1
into	1
the	1
air;	1
till	1
it	1
fell	1
again--gunwale	1
downwards--and	1
Ahab	1
and	1
his	1
men	1
struggled	1
out	1
from	1
under	1
it,	1
like	1
seals	1
from	1
a	1
sea-side	1
cave.	1
The	1
first	1
uprising	1
momentum	1
of	1
the	1
whale--modifying	1
its	1
direction	1
as	1
he	1
struck	1
the	1
surface--involuntarily	1
launched	1
him	1
along	1
it,	1
to	1
a	1
little	1
distance	1
from	1
the	1
centre	1
of	1
the	1
destruction	1
he	1
had	1
made;	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
back	1
to	1
it,	1
he	1
now	1
lay	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
slowly	1
feeling	1
with	1
his	1
flukes	1
from	1
side	1
to	1
side;	1
and	1
whenever	1
a	1
stray	1
oar,	1
bit	1
of	1
plank,	1
the	1
least	1
chip	1
or	1
crumb	1
of	1
the	1
boats	1
touched	1
his	1
skin,	1
his	1
tail	1
swiftly	1
drew	1
back,	1
and	1
came	1
sideways	1
smiting	1
the	1
sea.	1
But	1
soon,	1
as	1
if	1
satisfied	1
that	1
his	1
work	1
for	1
that	1
time	1
was	1
done,	1
he	1
pushed	1
his	1
pleated	1
forehead	1
through	1
the	1
ocean,	1
and	1
trailing	1
after	1
him	1
the	1
intertangled	1
lines,	1
continued	1
his	1
leeward	1
way	1
at	1
a	1
traveller's	1
methodic	1
pace.	1
As	1
before,	1
the	1
attentive	1
ship	1
having	1
descried	1
the	1
whole	1
fight,	1
again	1
came	1
bearing	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
rescue,	1
and	1
dropping	1
a	1
boat,	1
picked	1
up	1
the	1
floating	1
mariners,	1
tubs,	1
oars,	1
and	1
whatever	1
else	1
could	1
be	1
caught	1
at,	1
and	1
safely	1
landed	1
them	1
on	1
her	1
decks.	1
Some	1
sprained	1
shoulders,	1
wrists,	1
and	1
ankles;	1
livid	1
contusions;	1
wrenched	1
harpoons	1
and	1
lances;	1
inextricable	1
intricacies	1
of	1
rope;	1
shattered	1
oars	1
and	1
planks;	1
all	1
these	1
were	1
there;	1
but	1
no	1
fatal	1
or	1
even	1
serious	1
ill	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
befallen	1
any	1
one.	1
As	1
with	1
Fedallah	1
the	1
day	1
before,	1
so	1
Ahab	1
was	1
now	1
found	1
grimly	1
clinging	1
to	1
his	1
boat's	1
broken	1
half,	1
which	1
afforded	1
a	1
comparatively	1
easy	1
float;	1
nor	1
did	1
it	1
so	1
exhaust	1
him	1
as	1
the	1
previous	1
day's	1
mishap.	1
But	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
helped	1
to	1
the	1
deck,	1
all	1
eyes	1
were	1
fastened	1
upon	1
him;	1
as	1
instead	1
of	1
standing	1
by	1
himself	1
he	1
still	1
half-hung	1
upon	1
the	1
shoulder	1
of	1
Starbuck,	1
who	1
had	1
thus	1
far	1
been	1
the	1
foremost	1
to	1
assist	1
him.	1
His	1
ivory	1
leg	1
had	1
been	1
snapped	1
off,	1
leaving	1
but	1
one	1
short	1
sharp	1
splinter.	1
"Aye,	1
aye,	1
Starbuck,	1
'tis	1
sweet	1
to	1
lean	1
sometimes,	1
be	1
the	1
leaner	1
who	1
he	1
will;	1
and	1
would	1
old	1
Ahab	1
had	1
leaned	1
oftener	1
than	1
he	1
has."	1
"The	1
ferrule	1
has	1
not	1
stood,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
the	1
carpenter,	1
now	1
coming	1
up;	1
"I	1
put	1
good	1
work	1
into	1
that	1
leg."	1
"But	1
no	1
bones	1
broken,	1
sir,	1
I	1
hope,"	1
said	1
Stubb	1
with	1
true	1
concern.	1
"Aye!	1
and	1
all	1
splintered	1
to	1
pieces,	1
Stubb!--d'ye	1
see	1
it.--But	1
even	1
with	1
a	1
broken	1
bone,	1
old	1
Ahab	1
is	1
untouched;	1
and	1
I	1
account	1
no	1
living	1
bone	1
of	1
mine	1
one	1
jot	1
more	1
me,	1
than	1
this	1
dead	1
one	1
that's	1
lost.	1
Nor	1
white	1
whale,	1
nor	1
man,	1
nor	1
fiend,	1
can	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
graze	1
old	1
Ahab	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
proper	1
and	1
inaccessible	1
being.	1
Can	1
any	1
lead	1
touch	1
yonder	1
floor,	1
any	1
mast	1
scrape	1
yonder	1
roof?--Aloft	1
there!	1
which	1
way?"	1
"Dead	1
to	1
leeward,	1
sir."	1
"Up	1
helm,	1
then;	1
pile	1
on	1
the	1
sail	1
again,	1
ship	1
keepers!	1
down	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
spare	1
boats	1
and	1
rig	1
them--Mr.	1
Starbuck	1
away,	1
and	1
muster	1
the	1
boat's	1
crews."	1
"Let	1
me	1
first	1
help	1
thee	1
towards	1
the	1
bulwarks,	1
sir."	1
"Oh,	1
oh,	1
oh!	1
how	1
this	1
splinter	1
gores	1
me	1
now!	1
Accursed	1
fate!	1
that	1
the	1
unconquerable	1
captain	1
in	1
the	1
soul	1
should	1
have	1
such	1
a	1
craven	1
mate!"	1
"Sir?"	1
"My	1
body,	1
man,	1
not	1
thee.	1
Give	1
me	1
something	1
for	1
a	1
cane--there,	1
that	1
shivered	1
lance	1
will	1
do.	1
Muster	1
the	1
men.	1
Surely	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
seen	1
him	1
yet.	1
By	1
heaven	1
it	1
cannot	1
be!--missing?--quick!	1
call	1
them	1
all."	1
The	1
old	1
man's	1
hinted	1
thought	1
was	1
true.	1
Upon	1
mustering	1
the	1
company,	1
the	1
Parsee	1
was	1
not	1
there.	1
"The	1
Parsee!"	1
cried	1
Stubb--"he	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
caught	1
in--"	1
"The	1
black	1
vomit	1
wrench	1
thee!--run	1
all	1
of	1
ye	1
above,	1
alow,	1
cabin,	1
forecastle--find	1
him--not	1
gone--not	1
gone!"	1
But	1
quickly	1
they	1
returned	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
tidings	1
that	1
the	1
Parsee	1
was	1
nowhere	1
to	1
be	1
found.	1
"Aye,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
Stubb--"caught	1
among	1
the	1
tangles	1
of	1
your	1
line--I	1
thought	1
I	1
saw	1
him	1
dragging	1
under."	1
"MY	1
line!	1
MY	1
line?	1
Gone?--gone?	1
What	1
means	1
that	1
little	1
word?--What	1
death-knell	1
rings	1
in	1
it,	1
that	1
old	1
Ahab	1
shakes	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
the	1
belfry.	1
The	1
harpoon,	1
too!--toss	1
over	1
the	1
litter	1
there,--d'ye	1
see	1
it?--the	1
forged	1
iron,	1
men,	1
the	1
white	1
whale's--no,	1
no,	1
no,--blistered	1
fool!	1
this	1
hand	1
did	1
dart	1
it!--'tis	1
in	1
the	1
fish!--Aloft	1
there!	1
Keep	1
him	1
nailed--Quick!--all	1
hands	1
to	1
the	1
rigging	1
of	1
the	1
boats--collect	1
the	1
oars--harpooneers!	1
the	1
irons,	1
the	1
irons!--hoist	1
the	1
royals	1
higher--a	1
pull	1
on	1
all	1
the	1
sheets!--helm	1
there!	1
steady,	1
steady	1
for	1
your	1
life!	1
I'll	1
ten	1
times	1
girdle	1
the	1
unmeasured	1
globe;	1
yea	1
and	1
dive	1
straight	1
through	1
it,	1
but	1
I'll	1
slay	1
him	1
yet!	1
"Great	1
God!	1
but	1
for	1
one	1
single	1
instant	1
show	1
thyself,"	1
cried	1
Starbuck;	1
"never,	1
never	1
wilt	1
thou	1
capture	1
him,	1
old	1
man--In	1
Jesus'	1
name	1
no	1
more	1
of	1
this,	1
that's	1
worse	1
than	1
devil's	1
madness.	1
Two	1
days	1
chased;	1
twice	1
stove	1
to	1
splinters;	1
thy	1
very	1
leg	1
once	1
more	1
snatched	1
from	1
under	1
thee;	1
thy	1
evil	1
shadow	1
gone--all	1
good	1
angels	1
mobbing	1
thee	1
with	1
warnings:--	1
what	1
more	1
wouldst	1
thou	1
have?--Shall	1
we	1
keep	1
chasing	1
this	1
murderous	1
fish	1
till	1
he	1
swamps	1
the	1
last	1
man?	1
Shall	1
we	1
be	1
dragged	1
by	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
sea?	1
Shall	1
we	1
be	1
towed	1
by	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
infernal	1
world?	1
Oh,	1
oh,--Impiety	1
and	1
blasphemy	1
to	1
hunt	1
him	1
more!"	1
"Starbuck,	1
of	1
late	1
I've	1
felt	1
strangely	1
moved	1
to	1
thee;	1
ever	1
since	1
that	1
hour	1
we	1
both	1
saw--thou	1
know'st	1
what,	1
in	1
one	1
another's	1
eyes.	1
But	1
in	1
this	1
matter	1
of	1
the	1
whale,	1
be	1
the	1
front	1
of	1
thy	1
face	1
to	1
me	1
as	1
the	1
palm	1
of	1
this	1
hand--a	1
lipless,	1
unfeatured	1
blank.	1
Ahab	1
is	1
for	1
ever	1
Ahab,	1
man.	1
This	1
whole	1
act's	1
immutably	1
decreed.	1
'Twas	1
rehearsed	1
by	1
thee	1
and	1
me	1
a	1
billion	1
years	1
before	1
this	1
ocean	1
rolled.	1
Fool!	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
Fates'	1
lieutenant;	1
I	1
act	1
under	1
orders.	1
Look	1
thou,	1
underling!	1
that	1
thou	1
obeyest	1
mine.--Stand	1
round	1
me,	1
men.	1
Ye	1
see	1
an	1
old	1
man	1
cut	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
stump;	1
leaning	1
on	1
a	1
shivered	1
lance;	1
propped	1
up	1
on	1
a	1
lonely	1
foot.	1
'Tis	1
Ahab--his	1
body's	1
part;	1
but	1
Ahab's	1
soul's	1
a	1
centipede,	1
that	1
moves	1
upon	1
a	1
hundred	1
legs.	1
I	1
feel	1
strained,	1
half	1
stranded,	1
as	1
ropes	1
that	1
tow	1
dismasted	1
frigates	1
in	1
a	1
gale;	1
and	1
I	1
may	1
look	1
so.	1
But	1
ere	1
I	1
break,	1
yell	1
hear	1
me	1
crack;	1
and	1
till	1
ye	1
hear	1
THAT,	1
know	1
that	1
Ahab's	1
hawser	1
tows	1
his	1
purpose	1
yet.	1
Believe	1
ye,	1
men,	1
in	1
the	1
things	1
called	1
omens?	1
Then	1
laugh	1
aloud,	1
and	1
cry	1
encore!	1
For	1
ere	1
they	1
drown,	1
drowning	1
things	1
will	1
twice	1
rise	1
to	1
the	1
surface;	1
then	1
rise	1
again,	1
to	1
sink	1
for	1
evermore.	1
So	1
with	1
Moby	1
Dick--two	1
days	1
he's	1
floated--tomorrow	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
third.	1
Aye,	1
men,	1
he'll	1
rise	1
once	1
more,--but	1
only	1
to	1
spout	1
his	1
last!	1
D'ye	1
feel	1
brave	1
men,	1
brave?"	1
"As	1
fearless	1
fire,"	1
cried	1
Stubb.	1
"And	1
as	1
mechanical,"	1
muttered	1
Ahab.	1
Then	1
as	1
the	1
men	1
went	1
forward,	1
he	1
muttered	1
on:	1
"The	1
things	1
called	1
omens!	1
And	1
yesterday	1
I	1
talked	1
the	1
same	1
to	1
Starbuck	1
there,	1
concerning	1
my	1
broken	1
boat.	1
Oh!	1
how	1
valiantly	1
I	1
seek	1
to	1
drive	1
out	1
of	1
others'	1
hearts	1
what's	1
clinched	1
so	1
fast	1
in	1
mine!--The	1
Parsee--the	1
Parsee!--gone,	1
gone?	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
go	1
before:--but	1
still	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
again	1
ere	1
I	1
could	1
perish--How's	1
that?--There's	1
a	1
riddle	1
now	1
might	1
baffle	1
all	1
the	1
lawyers	1
backed	1
by	1
the	1
ghosts	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
line	1
of	1
judges:--like	1
a	1
hawk's	1
beak	1
it	1
pecks	1
my	1
brain.	1
I'LL,	1
I'LL	1
solve	1
it,	1
though!"	1
When	1
dusk	1
descended,	1
the	1
whale	1
was	1
still	1
in	1
sight	1
to	1
leeward.	1
So	1
once	1
more	1
the	1
sail	1
was	1
shortened,	1
and	1
everything	1
passed	1
nearly	1
as	1
on	1
the	1
previous	1
night;	1
only,	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
hammers,	1
and	1
the	1
hum	1
of	1
the	1
grindstone	1
was	1
heard	1
till	1
nearly	1
daylight,	1
as	1
the	1
men	1
toiled	1
by	1
lanterns	1
in	1
the	1
complete	1
and	1
careful	1
rigging	1
of	1
the	1
spare	1
boats	1
and	1
sharpening	1
their	1
fresh	1
weapons	1
for	1
the	1
morrow.	1
Meantime,	1
of	1
the	1
broken	1
keel	1
of	1
Ahab's	1
wrecked	1
craft	1
the	1
carpenter	1
made	1
him	1
another	1
leg;	1
while	1
still	1
as	1
on	1
the	1
night	1
before,	1
slouched	1
Ahab	1
stood	1
fixed	1
within	1
his	1
scuttle;	1
his	1
hid,	1
heliotrope	1
glance	1
anticipatingly	1
gone	1
backward	1
on	1
its	1
dial;	1
sat	1
due	1
eastward	1
for	1
the	1
earliest	1
sun.	1
CHAPTER	1
135	1
The	1
Chase.--Third	1
Day.	1
The	1
morning	1
of	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
dawned	1
fair	1
and	1
fresh,	1
and	1
once	1
more	1
the	1
solitary	1
night-man	1
at	1
the	1
fore-mast-head	1
was	1
relieved	1
by	1
crowds	1
of	1
the	1
daylight	1
look-outs,	1
who	1
dotted	1
every	1
mast	1
and	1
almost	1
every	1
spar.	1
"D'ye	1
see	1
him?"	1
cried	1
Ahab;	1
but	1
the	1
whale	1
was	1
not	1
yet	1
in	1
sight.	1
"In	1
his	1
infallible	1
wake,	1
though;	1
but	1
follow	1
that	1
wake,	1
that's	1
all.	1
Helm	1
there;	1
steady,	1
as	1
thou	1
goest,	1
and	1
hast	1
been	1
going.	1
What	1
a	1
lovely	1
day	1
again!	1
were	1
it	1
a	1
new-made	1
world,	1
and	1
made	1
for	1
a	1
summer-house	1
to	1
the	1
angels,	1
and	1
this	1
morning	1
the	1
first	1
of	1
its	1
throwing	1
open	1
to	1
them,	1
a	1
fairer	1
day	1
could	1
not	1
dawn	1
upon	1
that	1
world.	1
Here's	1
food	1
for	1
thought,	1
had	1
Ahab	1
time	1
to	1
think;	1
but	1
Ahab	1
never	1
thinks;	1
he	1
only	1
feels,	1
feels,	1
feels;	1
THAT'S	1
tingling	1
enough	1
for	1
mortal	1
man!	1
to	1
think's	1
audacity.	1
God	1
only	1
has	1
that	1
right	1
and	1
privilege.	1
Thinking	1
is,	1
or	1
ought	1
to	1
be,	1
a	1
coolness	1
and	1
a	1
calmness;	1
and	1
our	1
poor	1
hearts	1
throb,	1
and	1
our	1
poor	1
brains	1
beat	1
too	1
much	1
for	1
that.	1
And	1
yet,	1
I've	1
sometimes	1
thought	1
my	1
brain	1
was	1
very	1
calm--frozen	1
calm,	1
this	1
old	1
skull	1
cracks	1
so,	1
like	1
a	1
glass	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
contents	1
turned	1
to	1
ice,	1
and	1
shiver	1
it.	1
And	1
still	1
this	1
hair	1
is	1
growing	1
now;	1
this	1
moment	1
growing,	1
and	1
heat	1
must	1
breed	1
it;	1
but	1
no,	1
it's	1
like	1
that	1
sort	1
of	1
common	1
grass	1
that	1
will	1
grow	1
anywhere,	1
between	1
the	1
earthy	1
clefts	1
of	1
Greenland	1
ice	1
or	1
in	1
Vesuvius	1
lava.	1
How	1
the	1
wild	1
winds	1
blow	1
it;	1
they	1
whip	1
it	1
about	1
me	1
as	1
the	1
torn	1
shreds	1
of	1
split	1
sails	1
lash	1
the	1
tossed	1
ship	1
they	1
cling	1
to.	1
A	1
vile	1
wind	1
that	1
has	1
no	1
doubt	1
blown	1
ere	1
this	1
through	1
prison	1
corridors	1
and	1
cells,	1
and	1
wards	1
of	1
hospitals,	1
and	1
ventilated	1
them,	1
and	1
now	1
comes	1
blowing	1
hither	1
as	1
innocent	1
as	1
fleeces.	1
Out	1
upon	1
it!--it's	1
tainted.	1
Were	1
I	1
the	1
wind,	1
I'd	1
blow	1
no	1
more	1
on	1
such	1
a	1
wicked,	1
miserable	1
world.	1
I'd	1
crawl	1
somewhere	1
to	1
a	1
cave,	1
and	1
slink	1
there.	1
And	1
yet,	1
'tis	1
a	1
noble	1
and	1
heroic	1
thing,	1
the	1
wind!	1
who	1
ever	1
conquered	1
it?	1
In	1
every	1
fight	1
it	1
has	1
the	1
last	1
and	1
bitterest	1
blow.	1
Run	1
tilting	1
at	1
it,	1
and	1
you	1
but	1
run	1
through	1
it.	1
Ha!	1
a	1
coward	1
wind	1
that	1
strikes	1
stark	1
naked	1
men,	1
but	1
will	1
not	1
stand	1
to	1
receive	1
a	1
single	1
blow.	1
Even	1
Ahab	1
is	1
a	1
braver	1
thing--a	1
nobler	1
thing	1
than	1
THAT.	1
Would	1
now	1
the	1
wind	1
but	1
had	1
a	1
body;	1
but	1
all	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
most	1
exasperate	1
and	1
outrage	1
mortal	1
man,	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
are	1
bodiless,	1
but	1
only	1
bodiless	1
as	1
objects,	1
not	1
as	1
agents.	1
There's	1
a	1
most	1
special,	1
a	1
most	1
cunning,	1
oh,	1
a	1
most	1
malicious	1
difference!	1
And	1
yet,	1
I	1
say	1
again,	1
and	1
swear	1
it	1
now,	1
that	1
there's	1
something	1
all	1
glorious	1
and	1
gracious	1
in	1
the	1
wind.	1
These	1
warm	1
Trade	1
Winds,	1
at	1
least,	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
clear	1
heavens	1
blow	1
straight	1
on,	1
in	1
strong	1
and	1
steadfast,	1
vigorous	1
mildness;	1
and	1
veer	1
not	1
from	1
their	1
mark,	1
however	1
the	1
baser	1
currents	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
may	1
turn	1
and	1
tack,	1
and	1
mightiest	1
Mississippies	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
swift	1
and	1
swerve	1
about,	1
uncertain	1
where	1
to	1
go	1
at	1
last.	1
And	1
by	1
the	1
eternal	1
Poles!	1
these	1
same	1
Trades	1
that	1
so	1
directly	1
blow	1
my	1
good	1
ship	1
on;	1
these	1
Trades,	1
or	1
something	1
like	1
them--something	1
so	1
unchangeable,	1
and	1
full	1
as	1
strong,	1
blow	1
my	1
keeled	1
soul	1
along!	1
To	1
it!	1
Aloft	1
there!	1
What	1
d'ye	1
see?"	1
"Nothing,	1
sir."	1
"Nothing!	1
and	1
noon	1
at	1
hand!	1
The	1
doubloon	1
goes	1
a-begging!	1
See	1
the	1
sun!	1
Aye,	1
aye,	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
so.	1
I've	1
oversailed	1
him.	1
How,	1
got	1
the	1
start?	1
Aye,	1
he's	1
chasing	1
ME	1
now;	1
not	1
I,	1
HIM--that's	1
bad;	1
I	1
might	1
have	1
known	1
it,	1
too.	1
Fool!	1
the	1
lines--the	1
harpoons	1
he's	1
towing.	1
Aye,	1
aye,	1
I	1
have	1
run	1
him	1
by	1
last	1
night.	1
About!	1
about!	1
Come	1
down,	1
all	1
of	1
ye,	1
but	1
the	1
regular	1
look	1
outs!	1
Man	1
the	1
braces!"	1
Steering	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
done,	1
the	1
wind	1
had	1
been	1
somewhat	1
on	1
the	1
Pequod's	1
quarter,	1
so	1
that	1
now	1
being	1
pointed	1
in	1
the	1
reverse	1
direction,	1
the	1
braced	1
ship	1
sailed	1
hard	1
upon	1
the	1
breeze	1
as	1
she	1
rechurned	1
the	1
cream	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
white	1
wake.	1
"Against	1
the	1
wind	1
he	1
now	1
steers	1
for	1
the	1
open	1
jaw,"	1
murmured	1
Starbuck	1
to	1
himself,	1
as	1
he	1
coiled	1
the	1
new-hauled	1
main-brace	1
upon	1
the	1
rail.	1
"God	1
keep	1
us,	1
but	1
already	1
my	1
bones	1
feel	1
damp	1
within	1
me,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
inside	1
wet	1
my	1
flesh.	1
I	1
misdoubt	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
disobey	1
my	1
God	1
in	1
obeying	1
him!"	1
"Stand	1
by	1
to	1
sway	1
me	1
up!"	1
cried	1
Ahab,	1
advancing	1
to	1
the	1
hempen	1
basket.	1
"We	1
should	1
meet	1
him	1
soon."	1
"Aye,	1
aye,	1
sir,"	1
and	1
straightway	1
Starbuck	1
did	1
Ahab's	1
bidding,	1
and	1
once	1
more	1
Ahab	1
swung	1
on	1
high.	1
A	1
whole	1
hour	1
now	1
passed;	1
gold-beaten	1
out	1
to	1
ages.	1
Time	1
itself	1
now	1
held	1
long	1
breaths	1
with	1
keen	1
suspense.	1
But	1
at	1
last,	1
some	1
three	1
points	1
off	1
the	1
weather	1
bow,	1
Ahab	1
descried	1
the	1
spout	1
again,	1
and	1
instantly	1
from	1
the	1
three	1
mast-heads	1
three	1
shrieks	1
went	1
up	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
tongues	1
of	1
fire	1
had	1
voiced	1
it.	1
"Forehead	1
to	1
forehead	1
I	1
meet	1
thee,	1
this	1
third	1
time,	1
Moby	1
Dick!	1
On	1
deck	1
there!--brace	1
sharper	1
up;	1
crowd	1
her	1
into	1
the	1
wind's	1
eye.	1
He's	1
too	1
far	1
off	1
to	1
lower	1
yet,	1
Mr.	1
Starbuck.	1
The	1
sails	1
shake!	1
Stand	1
over	1
that	1
helmsman	1
with	1
a	1
top-maul!	1
So,	1
so;	1
he	1
travels	1
fast,	1
and	1
I	1
must	1
down.	1
But	1
let	1
me	1
have	1
one	1
more	1
good	1
round	1
look	1
aloft	1
here	1
at	1
the	1
sea;	1
there's	1
time	1
for	1
that.	1
An	1
old,	1
old	1
sight,	1
and	1
yet	1
somehow	1
so	1
young;	1
aye,	1
and	1
not	1
changed	1
a	1
wink	1
since	1
I	1
first	1
saw	1
it,	1
a	1
boy,	1
from	1
the	1
sand-hills	1
of	1
Nantucket!	1
The	1
same!--the	1
same!--the	1
same	1
to	1
Noah	1
as	1
to	1
me.	1
There's	1
a	1
soft	1
shower	1
to	1
leeward.	1
Such	1
lovely	1
leewardings!	1
They	1
must	1
lead	1
somewhere--to	1
something	1
else	1
than	1
common	1
land,	1
more	1
palmy	1
than	1
the	1
palms.	1
Leeward!	1
the	1
white	1
whale	1
goes	1
that	1
way;	1
look	1
to	1
windward,	1
then;	1
the	1
better	1
if	1
the	1
bitterer	1
quarter.	1
But	1
good	1
bye,	1
good	1
bye,	1
old	1
mast-head!	1
What's	1
this?--green?	1
aye,	1
tiny	1
mosses	1
in	1
these	1
warped	1
cracks.	1
No	1
such	1
green	1
weather	1
stains	1
on	1
Ahab's	1
head!	1
There's	1
the	1
difference	1
now	1
between	1
man's	1
old	1
age	1
and	1
matter's.	1
But	1
aye,	1
old	1
mast,	1
we	1
both	1
grow	1
old	1
together;	1
sound	1
in	1
our	1
hulls,	1
though,	1
are	1
we	1
not,	1
my	1
ship?	1
Aye,	1
minus	1
a	1
leg,	1
that's	1
all.	1
By	1
heaven	1
this	1
dead	1
wood	1
has	1
the	1
better	1
of	1
my	1
live	1
flesh	1
every	1
way.	1
I	1
can't	1
compare	1
with	1
it;	1
and	1
I've	1
known	1
some	1
ships	1
made	1
of	1
dead	1
trees	1
outlast	1
the	1
lives	1
of	1
men	1
made	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
vital	1
stuff	1
of	1
vital	1
fathers.	1
What's	1
that	1
he	1
said?	1
he	1
should	1
still	1
go	1
before	1
me,	1
my	1
pilot;	1
and	1
yet	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
again?	1
But	1
where?	1
Will	1
I	1
have	1
eyes	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
supposing	1
I	1
descend	1
those	1
endless	1
stairs?	1
and	1
all	1
night	1
I've	1
been	1
sailing	1
from	1
him,	1
wherever	1
he	1
did	1
sink	1
to.	1
Aye,	1
aye,	1
like	1
many	1
more	1
thou	1
told'st	1
direful	1
truth	1
as	1
touching	1
thyself,	1
O	1
Parsee;	1
but,	1
Ahab,	1
there	1
thy	1
shot	1
fell	1
short.	1
Good-bye,	1
mast-head--keep	1
a	1
good	1
eye	1
upon	1
the	1
whale,	1
the	1
while	1
I'm	1
gone.	1
We'll	1
talk	1
to-morrow,	1
nay,	1
to-night,	1
when	1
the	1
white	1
whale	1
lies	1
down	1
there,	1
tied	1
by	1
head	1
and	1
tail."	1
He	1
gave	1
the	1
word;	1
and	1
still	1
gazing	1
round	1
him,	1
was	1
steadily	1
lowered	1
through	1
the	1
cloven	1
blue	1
air	1
to	1
the	1
deck.	1
In	1
due	1
time	1
the	1
boats	1
were	1
lowered;	1
but	1
as	1
standing	1
in	1
his	1
shallop's	1
stern,	1
Ahab	1
just	1
hovered	1
upon	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
the	1
descent,	1
he	1
waved	1
to	1
the	1
mate,--who	1
held	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
tackle-ropes	1
on	1
deck--and	1
bade	1
him	1
pause.	1
"Starbuck!"	1
"Sir?"	1
"For	1
the	1
third	1
time	1
my	1
soul's	1
ship	1
starts	1
upon	1
this	1
voyage,	1
Starbuck."	1
"Aye,	1
sir,	1
thou	1
wilt	1
have	1
it	1
so."	1
"Some	1
ships	1
sail	1
from	1
their	1
ports,	1
and	1
ever	1
afterwards	1
are	1
missing,	1
Starbuck!"	1
"Truth,	1
sir:	1
saddest	1
truth."	1
"Some	1
men	1
die	1
at	1
ebb	1
tide;	1
some	1
at	1
low	1
water;	1
some	1
at	1
the	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
flood;--and	1
I	1
feel	1
now	1
like	1
a	1
billow	1
that's	1
all	1
one	1
crested	1
comb,	1
Starbuck.	1
I	1
am	1
old;--shake	1
hands	1
with	1
me,	1
man."	1
Their	1
hands	1
met;	1
their	1
eyes	1
fastened;	1
Starbuck's	1
tears	1
the	1
glue.	1
"Oh,	1
my	1
captain,	1
my	1
captain!--noble	1
heart--go	1
not--go	1
not!--see,	1
it's	1
a	1
brave	1
man	1
that	1
weeps;	1
how	1
great	1
the	1
agony	1
of	1
the	1
persuasion	1
then!"	1
"Lower	1
away!"--cried	1
Ahab,	1
tossing	1
the	1
mate's	1
arm	1
from	1
him.	1
"Stand	1
by	1
the	1
crew!"	1
In	1
an	1
instant	1
the	1
boat	1
was	1
pulling	1
round	1
close	1
under	1
the	1
stern.	1
"The	1
sharks!	1
the	1
sharks!"	1
cried	1
a	1
voice	1
from	1
the	1
low	1
cabin-window	1
there;	1
"O	1
master,	1
my	1
master,	1
come	1
back!"	1
But	1
Ahab	1
heard	1
nothing;	1
for	1
his	1
own	1
voice	1
was	1
high-lifted	1
then;	1
and	1
the	1
boat	1
leaped	1
on.	1
Yet	1
the	1
voice	1
spake	1
true;	1
for	1
scarce	1
had	1
he	1
pushed	1
from	1
the	1
ship,	1
when	1
numbers	1
of	1
sharks,	1
seemingly	1
rising	1
from	1
out	1
the	1
dark	1
waters	1
beneath	1
the	1
hull,	1
maliciously	1
snapped	1
at	1
the	1
blades	1
of	1
the	1
oars,	1
every	1
time	1
they	1
dipped	1
in	1
the	1
water;	1
and	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
accompanied	1
the	1
boat	1
with	1
their	1
bites.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
thing	1
not	1
uncommonly	1
happening	1
to	1
the	1
whale-boats	1
in	1
those	1
swarming	1
seas;	1
the	1
sharks	1
at	1
times	1
apparently	1
following	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
prescient	1
way	1
that	1
vultures	1
hover	1
over	1
the	1
banners	1
of	1
marching	1
regiments	1
in	1
the	1
east.	1
But	1
these	1
were	1
the	1
first	1
sharks	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
observed	1
by	1
the	1
Pequod	1
since	1
the	1
White	1
Whale	1
had	1
been	1
first	1
descried;	1
and	1
whether	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
Ahab's	1
crew	1
were	1
all	1
such	1
tiger-yellow	1
barbarians,	1
and	1
therefore	1
their	1
flesh	1
more	1
musky	1
to	1
the	1
senses	1
of	1
the	1
sharks--a	1
matter	1
sometimes	1
well	1
known	1
to	1
affect	1
them,--however	1
it	1
was,	1
they	1
seemed	1
to	1
follow	1
that	1
one	1
boat	1
without	1
molesting	1
the	1
others.	1
"Heart	1
of	1
wrought	1
steel!"	1
murmured	1
Starbuck	1
gazing	1
over	1
the	1
side,	1
and	1
following	1
with	1
his	1
eyes	1
the	1
receding	1
boat--"canst	1
thou	1
yet	1
ring	1
boldly	1
to	1
that	1
sight?--lowering	1
thy	1
keel	1
among	1
ravening	1
sharks,	1
and	1
followed	1
by	1
them,	1
open-mouthed	1
to	1
the	1
chase;	1
and	1
this	1
the	1
critical	1
third	1
day?--For	1
when	1
three	1
days	1
flow	1
together	1
in	1
one	1
continuous	1
intense	1
pursuit;	1
be	1
sure	1
the	1
first	1
is	1
the	1
morning,	1
the	1
second	1
the	1
noon,	1
and	1
the	1
third	1
the	1
evening	1
and	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
that	1
thing--be	1
that	1
end	1
what	1
it	1
may.	1
Oh!	1
my	1
God!	1
what	1
is	1
this	1
that	1
shoots	1
through	1
me,	1
and	1
leaves	1
me	1
so	1
deadly	1
calm,	1
yet	1
expectant,--fixed	1
at	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
a	1
shudder!	1
Future	1
things	1
swim	1
before	1
me,	1
as	1
in	1
empty	1
outlines	1
and	1
skeletons;	1
all	1
the	1
past	1
is	1
somehow	1
grown	1
dim.	1
Mary,	1
girl!	1
thou	1
fadest	1
in	1
pale	1
glories	1
behind	1
me;	1
boy!	1
I	1
seem	1
to	1
see	1
but	1
thy	1
eyes	1
grown	1
wondrous	1
blue.	1
Strangest	1
problems	1
of	1
life	1
seem	1
clearing;	1
but	1
clouds	1
sweep	1
between--Is	1
my	1
journey's	1
end	1
coming?	1
My	1
legs	1
feel	1
faint;	1
like	1
his	1
who	1
has	1
footed	1
it	1
all	1
day.	1
Feel	1
thy	1
heart,--beats	1
it	1
yet?	1
Stir	1
thyself,	1
Starbuck!--stave	1
it	1
off--move,	1
move!	1
speak	1
aloud!--Mast-head	1
there!	1
See	1
ye	1
my	1
boy's	1
hand	1
on	1
the	1
hill?--Crazed;--aloft	1
there!--keep	1
thy	1
keenest	1
eye	1
upon	1
the	1
boats:--	1
mark	1
well	1
the	1
whale!--Ho!	1
again!--drive	1
off	1
that	1
hawk!	1
see!	1
he	1
pecks--he	1
tears	1
the	1
vane"--pointing	1
to	1
the	1
red	1
flag	1
flying	1
at	1
the	1
main-truck--"Ha!	1
he	1
soars	1
away	1
with	1
it!--Where's	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
now?	1
see'st	1
thou	1
that	1
sight,	1
oh	1
Ahab!--shudder,	1
shudder!"	1
The	1
boats	1
had	1
not	1
gone	1
very	1
far,	1
when	1
by	1
a	1
signal	1
from	1
the	1
mast-heads--a	1
downward	1
pointed	1
arm,	1
Ahab	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
whale	1
had	1
sounded;	1
but	1
intending	1
to	1
be	1
near	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
next	1
rising,	1
he	1
held	1
on	1
his	1
way	1
a	1
little	1
sideways	1
from	1
the	1
vessel;	1
the	1
becharmed	1
crew	1
maintaining	1
the	1
profoundest	1
silence,	1
as	1
the	1
head-beat	1
waves	1
hammered	1
and	1
hammered	1
against	1
the	1
opposing	1
bow.	1
"Drive,	1
drive	1
in	1
your	1
nails,	1
oh	1
ye	1
waves!	1
to	1
their	1
uttermost	1
heads	1
drive	1
them	1
in!	1
ye	1
but	1
strike	1
a	1
thing	1
without	1
a	1
lid;	1
and	1
no	1
coffin	1
and	1
no	1
hearse	1
can	1
be	1
mine:--and	1
hemp	1
only	1
can	1
kill	1
me!	1
Ha!	1
ha!"	1
Suddenly	1
the	1
waters	1
around	1
them	1
slowly	1
swelled	1
in	1
broad	1
circles;	1
then	1
quickly	1
upheaved,	1
as	1
if	1
sideways	1
sliding	1
from	1
a	1
submerged	1
berg	1
of	1
ice,	1
swiftly	1
rising	1
to	1
the	1
surface.	1
A	1
low	1
rumbling	1
sound	1
was	1
heard;	1
a	1
subterraneous	1
hum;	1
and	1
then	1
all	1
held	1
their	1
breaths;	1
as	1
bedraggled	1
with	1
trailing	1
ropes,	1
and	1
harpoons,	1
and	1
lances,	1
a	1
vast	1
form	1
shot	1
lengthwise,	1
but	1
obliquely	1
from	1
the	1
sea.	1
Shrouded	1
in	1
a	1
thin	1
drooping	1
veil	1
of	1
mist,	1
it	1
hovered	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
in	1
the	1
rainbowed	1
air;	1
and	1
then	1
fell	1
swamping	1
back	1
into	1
the	1
deep.	1
Crushed	1
thirty	1
feet	1
upwards,	1
the	1
waters	1
flashed	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
like	1
heaps	1
of	1
fountains,	1
then	1
brokenly	1
sank	1
in	1
a	1
shower	1
of	1
flakes,	1
leaving	1
the	1
circling	1
surface	1
creamed	1
like	1
new	1
milk	1
round	1
the	1
marble	1
trunk	1
of	1
the	1
whale.	1
"Give	1
way!"	1
cried	1
Ahab	1
to	1
the	1
oarsmen,	1
and	1
the	1
boats	1
darted	1
forward	1
to	1
the	1
attack;	1
but	1
maddened	1
by	1
yesterday's	1
fresh	1
irons	1
that	1
corroded	1
in	1
him,	1
Moby	1
Dick	1
seemed	1
combinedly	1
possessed	1
by	1
all	1
the	1
angels	1
that	1
fell	1
from	1
heaven.	1
The	1
wide	1
tiers	1
of	1
welded	1
tendons	1
overspreading	1
his	1
broad	1
white	1
forehead,	1
beneath	1
the	1
transparent	1
skin,	1
looked	1
knitted	1
together;	1
as	1
head	1
on,	1
he	1
came	1
churning	1
his	1
tail	1
among	1
the	1
boats;	1
and	1
once	1
more	1
flailed	1
them	1
apart;	1
spilling	1
out	1
the	1
irons	1
and	1
lances	1
from	1
the	1
two	1
mates'	1
boats,	1
and	1
dashing	1
in	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
upper	1
part	1
of	1
their	1
bows,	1
but	1
leaving	1
Ahab's	1
almost	1
without	1
a	1
scar.	1
While	1
Daggoo	1
and	1
Queequeg	1
were	1
stopping	1
the	1
strained	1
planks;	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
whale	1
swimming	1
out	1
from	1
them,	1
turned,	1
and	1
showed	1
one	1
entire	1
flank	1
as	1
he	1
shot	1
by	1
them	1
again;	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
a	1
quick	1
cry	1
went	1
up.	1
Lashed	1
round	1
and	1
round	1
to	1
the	1
fish's	1
back;	1
pinioned	1
in	1
the	1
turns	1
upon	1
turns	1
in	1
which,	1
during	1
the	1
past	1
night,	1
the	1
whale	1
had	1
reeled	1
the	1
involutions	1
of	1
the	1
lines	1
around	1
him,	1
the	1
half	1
torn	1
body	1
of	1
the	1
Parsee	1
was	1
seen;	1
his	1
sable	1
raiment	1
frayed	1
to	1
shreds;	1
his	1
distended	1
eyes	1
turned	1
full	1
upon	1
old	1
Ahab.	1
The	1
harpoon	1
dropped	1
from	1
his	1
hand.	1
"Befooled,	1
befooled!"--drawing	1
in	1
a	1
long	1
lean	1
breath--"Aye,	1
Parsee!	1
I	1
see	1
thee	1
again.--Aye,	1
and	1
thou	1
goest	1
before;	1
and	1
this,	1
THIS	1
then	1
is	1
the	1
hearse	1
that	1
thou	1
didst	1
promise.	1
But	1
I	1
hold	1
thee	1
to	1
the	1
last	1
letter	1
of	1
thy	1
word.	1
Where	1
is	1
the	1
second	1
hearse?	1
Away,	1
mates,	1
to	1
the	1
ship!	1
those	1
boats	1
are	1
useless	1
now;	1
repair	1
them	1
if	1
ye	1
can	1
in	1
time,	1
and	1
return	1
to	1
me;	1
if	1
not,	1
Ahab	1
is	1
enough	1
to	1
die--Down,	1
men!	1
the	1
first	1
thing	1
that	1
but	1
offers	1
to	1
jump	1
from	1
this	1
boat	1
I	1
stand	1
in,	1
that	1
thing	1
I	1
harpoon.	1
Ye	1
are	1
not	1
other	1
men,	1
but	1
my	1
arms	1
and	1
my	1
legs;	1
and	1
so	1
obey	1
me.--Where's	1
the	1
whale?	1
gone	1
down	1
again?"	1
But	1
he	1
looked	1
too	1
nigh	1
the	1
boat;	1
for	1
as	1
if	1
bent	1
upon	1
escaping	1
with	1
the	1
corpse	1
he	1
bore,	1
and	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
particular	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
last	1
encounter	1
had	1
been	1
but	1
a	1
stage	1
in	1
his	1
leeward	1
voyage,	1
Moby	1
Dick	1
was	1
now	1
again	1
steadily	1
swimming	1
forward;	1
and	1
had	1
almost	1
passed	1
the	1
ship,--which	1
thus	1
far	1
had	1
been	1
sailing	1
in	1
the	1
contrary	1
direction	1
to	1
him,	1
though	1
for	1
the	1
present	1
her	1
headway	1
had	1
been	1
stopped.	1
He	1
seemed	1
swimming	1
with	1
his	1
utmost	1
velocity,	1
and	1
now	1
only	1
intent	1
upon	1
pursuing	1
his	1
own	1
straight	1
path	1
in	1
the	1
sea.	1
"Oh!	1
Ahab,"	1
cried	1
Starbuck,	1
"not	1
too	1
late	1
is	1
it,	1
even	1
now,	1
the	1
third	1
day,	1
to	1
desist.	1
See!	1
Moby	1
Dick	1
seeks	1
thee	1
not.	1
It	1
is	1
thou,	1
thou,	1
that	1
madly	1
seekest	1
him!"	1
Setting	1
sail	1
to	1
the	1
rising	1
wind,	1
the	1
lonely	1
boat	1
was	1
swiftly	1
impelled	1
to	1
leeward,	1
by	1
both	1
oars	1
and	1
canvas.	1
And	1
at	1
last	1
when	1
Ahab	1
was	1
sliding	1
by	1
the	1
vessel,	1
so	1
near	1
as	1
plainly	1
to	1
distinguish	1
Starbuck's	1
face	1
as	1
he	1
leaned	1
over	1
the	1
rail,	1
he	1
hailed	1
him	1
to	1
turn	1
the	1
vessel	1
about,	1
and	1
follow	1
him,	1
not	1
too	1
swiftly,	1
at	1
a	1
judicious	1
interval.	1
Glancing	1
upwards,	1
he	1
saw	1
Tashtego,	1
Queequeg,	1
and	1
Daggoo,	1
eagerly	1
mounting	1
to	1
the	1
three	1
mast-heads;	1
while	1
the	1
oarsmen	1
were	1
rocking	1
in	1
the	1
two	1
staved	1
boats	1
which	1
had	1
but	1
just	1
been	1
hoisted	1
to	1
the	1
side,	1
and	1
were	1
busily	1
at	1
work	1
in	1
repairing	1
them.	1
One	1
after	1
the	1
other,	1
through	1
the	1
port-holes,	1
as	1
he	1
sped,	1
he	1
also	1
caught	1
flying	1
glimpses	1
of	1
Stubb	1
and	1
Flask,	1
busying	1
themselves	1
on	1
deck	1
among	1
bundles	1
of	1
new	1
irons	1
and	1
lances.	1
As	1
he	1
saw	1
all	1
this;	1
as	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
hammers	1
in	1
the	1
broken	1
boats;	1
far	1
other	1
hammers	1
seemed	1
driving	1
a	1
nail	1
into	1
his	1
heart.	1
But	1
he	1
rallied.	1
And	1
now	1
marking	1
that	1
the	1
vane	1
or	1
flag	1
was	1
gone	1
from	1
the	1
main-mast-head,	1
he	1
shouted	1
to	1
Tashtego,	1
who	1
had	1
just	1
gained	1
that	1
perch,	1
to	1
descend	1
again	1
for	1
another	1
flag,	1
and	1
a	1
hammer	1
and	1
nails,	1
and	1
so	1
nail	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
mast.	1
Whether	1
fagged	1
by	1
the	1
three	1
days'	1
running	1
chase,	1
and	1
the	1
resistance	1
to	1
his	1
swimming	1
in	1
the	1
knotted	1
hamper	1
he	1
bore;	1
or	1
whether	1
it	1
was	1
some	1
latent	1
deceitfulness	1
and	1
malice	1
in	1
him:	1
whichever	1
was	1
true,	1
the	1
White	1
Whale's	1
way	1
now	1
began	1
to	1
abate,	1
as	1
it	1
seemed,	1
from	1
the	1
boat	1
so	1
rapidly	1
nearing	1
him	1
once	1
more;	1
though	1
indeed	1
the	1
whale's	1
last	1
start	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
so	1
long	1
a	1
one	1
as	1
before.	1
And	1
still	1
as	1
Ahab	1
glided	1
over	1
the	1
waves	1
the	1
unpitying	1
sharks	1
accompanied	1
him;	1
and	1
so	1
pertinaciously	1
stuck	1
to	1
the	1
boat;	1
and	1
so	1
continually	1
bit	1
at	1
the	1
plying	1
oars,	1
that	1
the	1
blades	1
became	1
jagged	1
and	1
crunched,	1
and	1
left	1
small	1
splinters	1
in	1
the	1
sea,	1
at	1
almost	1
every	1
dip.	1
"Heed	1
them	1
not!	1
those	1
teeth	1
but	1
give	1
new	1
rowlocks	1
to	1
your	1
oars.	1
Pull	1
on!	1
'tis	1
the	1
better	1
rest,	1
the	1
shark's	1
jaw	1
than	1
the	1
yielding	1
water."	1
"But	1
at	1
every	1
bite,	1
sir,	1
the	1
thin	1
blades	1
grow	1
smaller	1
and	1
smaller!"	1
"They	1
will	1
last	1
long	1
enough!	1
pull	1
on!--But	1
who	1
can	1
tell"--he	1
muttered--"whether	1
these	1
sharks	1
swim	1
to	1
feast	1
on	1
the	1
whale	1
or	1
on	1
Ahab?--But	1
pull	1
on!	1
Aye,	1
all	1
alive,	1
now--we	1
near	1
him.	1
The	1
helm!	1
take	1
the	1
helm!	1
let	1
me	1
pass,"--and	1
so	1
saying	1
two	1
of	1
the	1
oarsmen	1
helped	1
him	1
forward	1
to	1
the	1
bows	1
of	1
the	1
still	1
flying	1
boat.	1
At	1
length	1
as	1
the	1
craft	1
was	1
cast	1
to	1
one	1
side,	1
and	1
ran	1
ranging	1
along	1
with	1
the	1
White	1
Whale's	1
flank,	1
he	1
seemed	1
strangely	1
oblivious	1
of	1
its	1
advance--as	1
the	1
whale	1
sometimes	1
will--and	1
Ahab	1
was	1
fairly	1
within	1
the	1
smoky	1
mountain	1
mist,	1
which,	1
thrown	1
off	1
from	1
the	1
whale's	1
spout,	1
curled	1
round	1
his	1
great,	1
Monadnock	1
hump;	1
he	1
was	1
even	1
thus	1
close	1
to	1
him;	1
when,	1
with	1
body	1
arched	1
back,	1
and	1
both	1
arms	1
lengthwise	1
high-lifted	1
to	1
the	1
poise,	1
he	1
darted	1
his	1
fierce	1
iron,	1
and	1
his	1
far	1
fiercer	1
curse	1
into	1
the	1
hated	1
whale.	1
As	1
both	1
steel	1
and	1
curse	1
sank	1
to	1
the	1
socket,	1
as	1
if	1
sucked	1
into	1
a	1
morass,	1
Moby	1
Dick	1
sideways	1
writhed;	1
spasmodically	1
rolled	1
his	1
nigh	1
flank	1
against	1
the	1
bow,	1
and,	1
without	1
staving	1
a	1
hole	1
in	1
it,	1
so	1
suddenly	1
canted	1
the	1
boat	1
over,	1
that	1
had	1
it	1
not	1
been	1
for	1
the	1
elevated	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
gunwale	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
then	1
clung,	1
Ahab	1
would	1
once	1
more	1
have	1
been	1
tossed	1
into	1
the	1
sea.	1
As	1
it	1
was,	1
three	1
of	1
the	1
oarsmen--who	1
foreknew	1
not	1
the	1
precise	1
instant	1
of	1
the	1
dart,	1
and	1
were	1
therefore	1
unprepared	1
for	1
its	1
effects--these	1
were	1
flung	1
out;	1
but	1
so	1
fell,	1
that,	1
in	1
an	1
instant	1
two	1
of	1
them	1
clutched	1
the	1
gunwale	1
again,	1
and	1
rising	1
to	1
its	1
level	1
on	1
a	1
combing	1
wave,	1
hurled	1
themselves	1
bodily	1
inboard	1
again;	1
the	1
third	1
man	1
helplessly	1
dropping	1
astern,	1
but	1
still	1
afloat	1
and	1
swimming.	1
Almost	1
simultaneously,	1
with	1
a	1
mighty	1
volition	1
of	1
ungraduated,	1
instantaneous	1
swiftness,	1
the	1
White	1
Whale	1
darted	1
through	1
the	1
weltering	1
sea.	1
But	1
when	1
Ahab	1
cried	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
steersman	1
to	1
take	1
new	1
turns	1
with	1
the	1
line,	1
and	1
hold	1
it	1
so;	1
and	1
commanded	1
the	1
crew	1
to	1
turn	1
round	1
on	1
their	1
seats,	1
and	1
tow	1
the	1
boat	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
mark;	1
the	1
moment	1
the	1
treacherous	1
line	1
felt	1
that	1
double	1
strain	1
and	1
tug,	1
it	1
snapped	1
in	1
the	1
empty	1
air!	1
"What	1
breaks	1
in	1
me?	1
Some	1
sinew	1
cracks!--'tis	1
whole	1
again;	1
oars!	1
oars!	1
Burst	1
in	1
upon	1
him!"	1
Hearing	1
the	1
tremendous	1
rush	1
of	1
the	1
sea-crashing	1
boat,	1
the	1
whale	1
wheeled	1
round	1
to	1
present	1
his	1
blank	1
forehead	1
at	1
bay;	1
but	1
in	1
that	1
evolution,	1
catching	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
nearing	1
black	1
hull	1
of	1
the	1
ship;	1
seemingly	1
seeing	1
in	1
it	1
the	1
source	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
persecutions;	1
bethinking	1
it--it	1
may	1
be--a	1
larger	1
and	1
nobler	1
foe;	1
of	1
a	1
sudden,	1
he	1
bore	1
down	1
upon	1
its	1
advancing	1
prow,	1
smiting	1
his	1
jaws	1
amid	1
fiery	1
showers	1
of	1
foam.	1
Ahab	1
staggered;	1
his	1
hand	1
smote	1
his	1
forehead.	1
"I	1
grow	1
blind;	1
hands!	1
stretch	1
out	1
before	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
yet	1
grope	1
my	1
way.	1
Is't	1
night?"	1
"The	1
whale!	1
The	1
ship!"	1
cried	1
the	1
cringing	1
oarsmen.	1
"Oars!	1
oars!	1
Slope	1
downwards	1
to	1
thy	1
depths,	1
O	1
sea,	1
that	1
ere	1
it	1
be	1
for	1
ever	1
too	1
late,	1
Ahab	1
may	1
slide	1
this	1
last,	1
last	1
time	1
upon	1
his	1
mark!	1
I	1
see:	1
the	1
ship!	1
the	1
ship!	1
Dash	1
on,	1
my	1
men!	1
Will	1
ye	1
not	1
save	1
my	1
ship?"	1
But	1
as	1
the	1
oarsmen	1
violently	1
forced	1
their	1
boat	1
through	1
the	1
sledge-hammering	1
seas,	1
the	1
before	1
whale-smitten	1
bow-ends	1
of	1
two	1
planks	1
burst	1
through,	1
and	1
in	1
an	1
instant	1
almost,	1
the	1
temporarily	1
disabled	1
boat	1
lay	1
nearly	1
level	1
with	1
the	1
waves;	1
its	1
half-wading,	1
splashing	1
crew,	1
trying	1
hard	1
to	1
stop	1
the	1
gap	1
and	1
bale	1
out	1
the	1
pouring	1
water.	1
Meantime,	1
for	1
that	1
one	1
beholding	1
instant,	1
Tashtego's	1
mast-head	1
hammer	1
remained	1
suspended	1
in	1
his	1
hand;	1
and	1
the	1
red	1
flag,	1
half-wrapping	1
him	1
as	1
with	1
a	1
plaid,	1
then	1
streamed	1
itself	1
straight	1
out	1
from	1
him,	1
as	1
his	1
own	1
forward-flowing	1
heart;	1
while	1
Starbuck	1
and	1
Stubb,	1
standing	1
upon	1
the	1
bowsprit	1
beneath,	1
caught	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
down-coming	1
monster	1
just	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he.	1
"The	1
whale,	1
the	1
whale!	1
Up	1
helm,	1
up	1
helm!	1
Oh,	1
all	1
ye	1
sweet	1
powers	1
of	1
air,	1
now	1
hug	1
me	1
close!	1
Let	1
not	1
Starbuck	1
die,	1
if	1
die	1
he	1
must,	1
in	1
a	1
woman's	1
fainting	1
fit.	1
Up	1
helm,	1
I	1
say--ye	1
fools,	1
the	1
jaw!	1
the	1
jaw!	1
Is	1
this	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
all	1
my	1
bursting	1
prayers?	1
all	1
my	1
life-long	1
fidelities?	1
Oh,	1
Ahab,	1
Ahab,	1
lo,	1
thy	1
work.	1
Steady!	1
helmsman,	1
steady.	1
Nay,	1
nay!	1
Up	1
helm	1
again!	1
He	1
turns	1
to	1
meet	1
us!	1
Oh,	1
his	1
unappeasable	1
brow	1
drives	1
on	1
towards	1
one,	1
whose	1
duty	1
tells	1
him	1
he	1
cannot	1
depart.	1
My	1
God,	1
stand	1
by	1
me	1
now!"	1
"Stand	1
not	1
by	1
me,	1
but	1
stand	1
under	1
me,	1
whoever	1
you	1
are	1
that	1
will	1
now	1
help	1
Stubb;	1
for	1
Stubb,	1
too,	1
sticks	1
here.	1
I	1
grin	1
at	1
thee,	1
thou	1
grinning	1
whale!	1
Who	1
ever	1
helped	1
Stubb,	1
or	1
kept	1
Stubb	1
awake,	1
but	1
Stubb's	1
own	1
unwinking	1
eye?	1
And	1
now	1
poor	1
Stubb	1
goes	1
to	1
bed	1
upon	1
a	1
mattrass	1
that	1
is	1
all	1
too	1
soft;	1
would	1
it	1
were	1
stuffed	1
with	1
brushwood!	1
I	1
grin	1
at	1
thee,	1
thou	1
grinning	1
whale!	1
Look	1
ye,	1
sun,	1
moon,	1
and	1
stars!	1
I	1
call	1
ye	1
assassins	1
of	1
as	1
good	1
a	1
fellow	1
as	1
ever	1
spouted	1
up	1
his	1
ghost.	1
For	1
all	1
that,	1
I	1
would	1
yet	1
ring	1
glasses	1
with	1
ye,	1
would	1
ye	1
but	1
hand	1
the	1
cup!	1
Oh,	1
oh!	1
oh,	1
oh!	1
thou	1
grinning	1
whale,	1
but	1
there'll	1
be	1
plenty	1
of	1
gulping	1
soon!	1
Why	1
fly	1
ye	1
not,	1
O	1
Ahab!	1
For	1
me,	1
off	1
shoes	1
and	1
jacket	1
to	1
it;	1
let	1
Stubb	1
die	1
in	1
his	1
drawers!	1
A	1
most	1
mouldy	1
and	1
over	1
salted	1
death,	1
though;--cherries!	1
cherries!	1
cherries!	1
Oh,	1
Flask,	1
for	1
one	1
red	1
cherry	1
ere	1
we	1
die!"	1
"Cherries?	1
I	1
only	1
wish	1
that	1
we	1
were	1
where	1
they	1
grow.	1
Oh,	1
Stubb,	1
I	1
hope	1
my	1
poor	1
mother's	1
drawn	1
my	1
part-pay	1
ere	1
this;	1
if	1
not,	1
few	1
coppers	1
will	1
now	1
come	1
to	1
her,	1
for	1
the	1
voyage	1
is	1
up."	1
From	1
the	1
ship's	1
bows,	1
nearly	1
all	1
the	1
seamen	1
now	1
hung	1
inactive;	1
hammers,	1
bits	1
of	1
plank,	1
lances,	1
and	1
harpoons,	1
mechanically	1
retained	1
in	1
their	1
hands,	1
just	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
darted	1
from	1
their	1
various	1
employments;	1
all	1
their	1
enchanted	1
eyes	1
intent	1
upon	1
the	1
whale,	1
which	1
from	1
side	1
to	1
side	1
strangely	1
vibrating	1
his	1
predestinating	1
head,	1
sent	1
a	1
broad	1
band	1
of	1
overspreading	1
semicircular	1
foam	1
before	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
rushed.	1
Retribution,	1
swift	1
vengeance,	1
eternal	1
malice	1
were	1
in	1
his	1
whole	1
aspect,	1
and	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
mortal	1
man	1
could	1
do,	1
the	1
solid	1
white	1
buttress	1
of	1
his	1
forehead	1
smote	1
the	1
ship's	1
starboard	1
bow,	1
till	1
men	1
and	1
timbers	1
reeled.	1
Some	1
fell	1
flat	1
upon	1
their	1
faces.	1
Like	1
dislodged	1
trucks,	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
the	1
harpooneers	1
aloft	1
shook	1
on	1
their	1
bull-like	1
necks.	1
Through	1
the	1
breach,	1
they	1
heard	1
the	1
waters	1
pour,	1
as	1
mountain	1
torrents	1
down	1
a	1
flume.	1
"The	1
ship!	1
The	1
hearse!--the	1
second	1
hearse!"	1
cried	1
Ahab	1
from	1
the	1
boat;	1
"its	1
wood	1
could	1
only	1
be	1
American!"	1
Diving	1
beneath	1
the	1
settling	1
ship,	1
the	1
whale	1
ran	1
quivering	1
along	1
its	1
keel;	1
but	1
turning	1
under	1
water,	1
swiftly	1
shot	1
to	1
the	1
surface	1
again,	1
far	1
off	1
the	1
other	1
bow,	1
but	1
within	1
a	1
few	1
yards	1
of	1
Ahab's	1
boat,	1
where,	1
for	1
a	1
time,	1
he	1
lay	1
quiescent.	1
"I	1
turn	1
my	1
body	1
from	1
the	1
sun.	1
What	1
ho,	1
Tashtego!	1
let	1
me	1
hear	1
thy	1
hammer.	1
Oh!	1
ye	1
three	1
unsurrendered	1
spires	1
of	1
mine;	1
thou	1
uncracked	1
keel;	1
and	1
only	1
god-bullied	1
hull;	1
thou	1
firm	1
deck,	1
and	1
haughty	1
helm,	1
and	1
Pole-pointed	1
prow,--death-glorious	1
ship!	1
must	1
ye	1
then	1
perish,	1
and	1
without	1
me?	1
Am	1
I	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
the	1
last	1
fond	1
pride	1
of	1
meanest	1
shipwrecked	1
captains?	1
Oh,	1
lonely	1
death	1
on	1
lonely	1
life!	1
Oh,	1
now	1
I	1
feel	1
my	1
topmost	1
greatness	1
lies	1
in	1
my	1
topmost	1
grief.	1
Ho,	1
ho!	1
from	1
all	1
your	1
furthest	1
bounds,	1
pour	1
ye	1
now	1
in,	1
ye	1
bold	1
billows	1
of	1
my	1
whole	1
foregone	1
life,	1
and	1
top	1
this	1
one	1
piled	1
comber	1
of	1
my	1
death!	1
Towards	1
thee	1
I	1
roll,	1
thou	1
all-destroying	1
but	1
unconquering	1
whale;	1
to	1
the	1
last	1
I	1
grapple	1
with	1
thee;	1
from	1
hell's	1
heart	1
I	1
stab	1
at	1
thee;	1
for	1
hate's	1
sake	1
I	1
spit	1
my	1
last	1
breath	1
at	1
thee.	1
Sink	1
all	1
coffins	1
and	1
all	1
hearses	1
to	1
one	1
common	1
pool!	1
and	1
since	1
neither	1
can	1
be	1
mine,	1
let	1
me	1
then	1
tow	1
to	1
pieces,	1
while	1
still	1
chasing	1
thee,	1
though	1
tied	1
to	1
thee,	1
thou	1
damned	1
whale!	1
THUS,	1
I	1
give	1
up	1
the	1
spear!"	1
The	1
harpoon	1
was	1
darted;	1
the	1
stricken	1
whale	1
flew	1
forward;	1
with	1
igniting	1
velocity	1
the	1
line	1
ran	1
through	1
the	1
grooves;--ran	1
foul.	1
Ahab	1
stooped	1
to	1
clear	1
it;	1
he	1
did	1
clear	1
it;	1
but	1
the	1
flying	1
turn	1
caught	1
him	1
round	1
the	1
neck,	1
and	1
voicelessly	1
as	1
Turkish	1
mutes	1
bowstring	1
their	1
victim,	1
he	1
was	1
shot	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
boat,	1
ere	1
the	1
crew	1
knew	1
he	1
was	1
gone.	1
Next	1
instant,	1
the	1
heavy	1
eye-splice	1
in	1
the	1
rope's	1
final	1
end	1
flew	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
stark-empty	1
tub,	1
knocked	1
down	1
an	1
oarsman,	1
and	1
smiting	1
the	1
sea,	1
disappeared	1
in	1
its	1
depths.	1
For	1
an	1
instant,	1
the	1
tranced	1
boat's	1
crew	1
stood	1
still;	1
then	1
turned.	1
"The	1
ship?	1
Great	1
God,	1
where	1
is	1
the	1
ship?"	1
Soon	1
they	1
through	1
dim,	1
bewildering	1
mediums	1
saw	1
her	1
sidelong	1
fading	1
phantom,	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
gaseous	1
Fata	1
Morgana;	1
only	1
the	1
uppermost	1
masts	1
out	1
of	1
water;	1
while	1
fixed	1
by	1
infatuation,	1
or	1
fidelity,	1
or	1
fate,	1
to	1
their	1
once	1
lofty	1
perches,	1
the	1
pagan	1
harpooneers	1
still	1
maintained	1
their	1
sinking	1
lookouts	1
on	1
the	1
sea.	1
And	1
now,	1
concentric	1
circles	1
seized	1
the	1
lone	1
boat	1
itself,	1
and	1
all	1
its	1
crew,	1
and	1
each	1
floating	1
oar,	1
and	1
every	1
lance-pole,	1
and	1
spinning,	1
animate	1
and	1
inanimate,	1
all	1
round	1
and	1
round	1
in	1
one	1
vortex,	1
carried	1
the	1
smallest	1
chip	1
of	1
the	1
Pequod	1
out	1
of	1
sight.	1
But	1
as	1
the	1
last	1
whelmings	1
intermixingly	1
poured	1
themselves	1
over	1
the	1
sunken	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
Indian	1
at	1
the	1
mainmast,	1
leaving	1
a	1
few	1
inches	1
of	1
the	1
erect	1
spar	1
yet	1
visible,	1
together	1
with	1
long	1
streaming	1
yards	1
of	1
the	1
flag,	1
which	1
calmly	1
undulated,	1
with	1
ironical	1
coincidings,	1
over	1
the	1
destroying	1
billows	1
they	1
almost	1
touched;--at	1
that	1
instant,	1
a	1
red	1
arm	1
and	1
a	1
hammer	1
hovered	1
backwardly	1
uplifted	1
in	1
the	1
open	1
air,	1
in	1
the	1
act	1
of	1
nailing	1
the	1
flag	1
faster	1
and	1
yet	1
faster	1
to	1
the	1
subsiding	1
spar.	1
A	1
sky-hawk	1
that	1
tauntingly	1
had	1
followed	1
the	1
main-truck	1
downwards	1
from	1
its	1
natural	1
home	1
among	1
the	1
stars,	1
pecking	1
at	1
the	1
flag,	1
and	1
incommoding	1
Tashtego	1
there;	1
this	1
bird	1
now	1
chanced	1
to	1
intercept	1
its	1
broad	1
fluttering	1
wing	1
between	1
the	1
hammer	1
and	1
the	1
wood;	1
and	1
simultaneously	1
feeling	1
that	1
etherial	1
thrill,	1
the	1
submerged	1
savage	1
beneath,	1
in	1
his	1
death-gasp,	1
kept	1
his	1
hammer	1
frozen	1
there;	1
and	1
so	1
the	1
bird	1
of	1
heaven,	1
with	1
archangelic	1
shrieks,	1
and	1
his	1
imperial	1
beak	1
thrust	1
upwards,	1
and	1
his	1
whole	1
captive	1
form	1
folded	1
in	1
the	1
flag	1
of	1
Ahab,	1
went	1
down	1
with	1
his	1
ship,	1
which,	1
like	1
Satan,	1
would	1
not	1
sink	1
to	1
hell	1
till	1
she	1
had	1
dragged	1
a	1
living	1
part	1
of	1
heaven	1
along	1
with	1
her,	1
and	1
helmeted	1
herself	1
with	1
it.	1
Now	1
small	1
fowls	1
flew	1
screaming	1
over	1
the	1
yet	1
yawning	1
gulf;	1
a	1
sullen	1
white	1
surf	1
beat	1
against	1
its	1
steep	1
sides;	1
then	1
all	1
collapsed,	1
and	1
the	1
great	1
shroud	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
rolled	1
on	1
as	1
it	1
rolled	1
five	1
thousand	1
years	1
ago.	1
Epilogue	1
"AND	1
I	1
ONLY	1
AM	1
ESCAPED	1
ALONE	1
TO	1
TELL	1
THEE"	1
Job.	1
The	1
drama's	1
done.	1
Why	1
then	1
here	1
does	1
any	1
one	1
step	1
forth?--Because	1
one	1
did	1
survive	1
the	1
wreck.	1
It	1
so	1
chanced,	1
that	1
after	1
the	1
Parsee's	1
disappearance,	1
I	1
was	1
he	1
whom	1
the	1
Fates	1
ordained	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
Ahab's	1
bowsman,	1
when	1
that	1
bowsman	1
assumed	1
the	1
vacant	1
post;	1
the	1
same,	1
who,	1
when	1
on	1
the	1
last	1
day	1
the	1
three	1
men	1
were	1
tossed	1
from	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
rocking	1
boat,	1
was	1
dropped	1
astern.	1
So,	1
floating	1
on	1
the	1
margin	1
of	1
the	1
ensuing	1
scene,	1
and	1
in	1
full	1
sight	1
of	1
it,	1
when	1
the	1
halfspent	1
suction	1
of	1
the	1
sunk	1
ship	1
reached	1
me,	1
I	1
was	1
then,	1
but	1
slowly,	1
drawn	1
towards	1
the	1
closing	1
vortex.	1
When	1
I	1
reached	1
it,	1
it	1
had	1
subsided	1
to	1
a	1
creamy	1
pool.	1
Round	1
and	1
round,	1
then,	1
and	1
ever	1
contracting	1
towards	1
the	1
button-like	1
black	1
bubble	1
at	1
the	1
axis	1
of	1
that	1
slowly	1
wheeling	1
circle,	1
like	1
another	1
Ixion	1
I	1
did	1
revolve.	1
Till,	1
gaining	1
that	1
vital	1
centre,	1
the	1
black	1
bubble	1
upward	1
burst;	1
and	1
now,	1
liberated	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
its	1
cunning	1
spring,	1
and,	1
owing	1
to	1
its	1
great	1
buoyancy,	1
rising	1
with	1
great	1
force,	1
the	1
coffin	1
life-buoy	1
shot	1
lengthwise	1
from	1
the	1
sea,	1
fell	1
over,	1
and	1
floated	1
by	1
my	1
side.	1
Buoyed	1
up	1
by	1
that	1
coffin,	1
for	1
almost	1
one	1
whole	1
day	1
and	1
night,	1
I	1
floated	1
on	1
a	1
soft	1
and	1
dirgelike	1
main.	1
The	1
unharming	1
sharks,	1
they	1
glided	1
by	1
as	1
if	1
with	1
padlocks	1
on	1
their	1
mouths;	1
the	1
savage	1
sea-hawks	1
sailed	1
with	1
sheathed	1
beaks.	1
On	1
the	1
second	1
day,	1
a	1
sail	1
drew	1
near,	1
nearer,	1
and	1
picked	1
me	1
up	1
at	1
last.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
devious-cruising	1
Rachel,	1
that	1
in	1
her	1
retracing	1
search	1
after	1
her	1
missing	1
children,	1
only	1
found	1
another	1
orphan.	1
