CHAPTER	1
I.	1
Down	1
the	1
Rabbit-Hole	1
Alice	1
was	1
beginning	1
to	1
get	1
very	1
tired	1
of	1
sitting	1
by	1
her	1
sister	1
on	1
the	1
bank,	1
and	1
of	1
having	1
nothing	1
to	1
do:	1
once	1
or	1
twice	1
she	1
had	1
peeped	1
into	1
the	1
book	1
her	1
sister	1
was	1
reading,	1
but	1
it	1
had	1
no	1
pictures	1
or	1
conversations	1
in	1
it,	1
'and	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
a	1
book,'	1
thought	1
Alice	1
'without	1
pictures	1
or	1
conversation?'	1
So	1
she	1
was	1
considering	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
mind	1
(as	1
well	1
as	1
she	1
could,	1
for	1
the	1
hot	1
day	1
made	1
her	1
feel	1
very	1
sleepy	1
and	1
stupid),	1
whether	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
making	1
a	1
daisy-chain	1
would	1
be	1
worth	1
the	1
trouble	1
of	1
getting	1
up	1
and	1
picking	1
the	1
daisies,	1
when	1
suddenly	1
a	1
White	1
Rabbit	1
with	1
pink	1
eyes	1
ran	1
close	1
by	1
her.	1
There	1
was	1
nothing	1
so	1
VERY	1
remarkable	1
in	1
that;	1
nor	1
did	1
Alice	1
think	1
it	1
so	1
VERY	1
much	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
Rabbit	1
say	1
to	1
itself,	1
'Oh	1
dear!	1
Oh	1
dear!	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
late!'	1
(when	1
she	1
thought	1
it	1
over	1
afterwards,	1
it	1
occurred	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
she	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
wondered	1
at	1
this,	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
it	1
all	1
seemed	1
quite	1
natural);	1
but	1
when	1
the	1
Rabbit	1
actually	1
TOOK	1
A	1
WATCH	1
OUT	1
OF	1
ITS	1
WAISTCOAT-POCKET,	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
it,	1
and	1
then	1
hurried	1
on,	1
Alice	1
started	1
to	1
her	1
feet,	1
for	1
it	1
flashed	1
across	1
her	1
mind	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
never	1
before	1
seen	1
a	1
rabbit	1
with	1
either	1
a	1
waistcoat-pocket,	1
or	1
a	1
watch	1
to	1
take	1
out	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
burning	1
with	1
curiosity,	1
she	1
ran	1
across	1
the	1
field	1
after	1
it,	1
and	1
fortunately	1
was	1
just	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
see	1
it	1
pop	1
down	1
a	1
large	1
rabbit-hole	1
under	1
the	1
hedge.	1
In	1
another	1
moment	1
down	1
went	1
Alice	1
after	1
it,	1
never	1
once	1
considering	1
how	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
she	1
was	1
to	1
get	1
out	1
again.	1
The	1
rabbit-hole	1
went	1
straight	1
on	1
like	1
a	1
tunnel	1
for	1
some	1
way,	1
and	1
then	1
dipped	1
suddenly	1
down,	1
so	1
suddenly	1
that	1
Alice	1
had	1
not	1
a	1
moment	1
to	1
think	1
about	1
stopping	1
herself	1
before	1
she	1
found	1
herself	1
falling	1
down	1
a	1
very	1
deep	1
well.	1
Either	1
the	1
well	1
was	1
very	1
deep,	1
or	1
she	1
fell	1
very	1
slowly,	1
for	1
she	1
had	1
plenty	1
of	1
time	1
as	1
she	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
look	1
about	1
her	1
and	1
to	1
wonder	1
what	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
happen	1
next.	1
First,	1
she	1
tried	1
to	1
look	1
down	1
and	1
make	1
out	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
coming	1
to,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
too	1
dark	1
to	1
see	1
anything;	1
then	1
she	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
well,	1
and	1
noticed	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
filled	1
with	1
cupboards	1
and	1
book-shelves;	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
she	1
saw	1
maps	1
and	1
pictures	1
hung	1
upon	1
pegs.	1
She	1
took	1
down	1
a	1
jar	1
from	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
shelves	1
as	1
she	1
passed;	1
it	1
was	1
labelled	1
'ORANGE	1
MARMALADE',	1
but	1
to	1
her	1
great	1
disappointment	1
it	1
was	1
empty:	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
to	1
drop	1
the	1
jar	1
for	1
fear	1
of	1
killing	1
somebody,	1
so	1
managed	1
to	1
put	1
it	1
into	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
cupboards	1
as	1
she	1
fell	1
past	1
it.	1
'Well!'	1
thought	1
Alice	1
to	1
herself,	1
'after	1
such	1
a	1
fall	1
as	1
this,	1
I	1
shall	1
think	1
nothing	1
of	1
tumbling	1
down	1
stairs!	1
How	1
brave	1
they'll	1
all	1
think	1
me	1
at	1
home!	1
Why,	1
I	1
wouldn't	1
say	1
anything	1
about	1
it,	1
even	1
if	1
I	1
fell	1
off	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
house!'	1
(Which	1
was	1
very	1
likely	1
true.)	1
Down,	1
down,	1
down.	1
Would	1
the	1
fall	1
NEVER	1
come	1
to	1
an	1
end!	1
'I	1
wonder	1
how	1
many	1
miles	1
I've	1
fallen	1
by	1
this	1
time?'	1
she	1
said	1
aloud.	1
'I	1
must	1
be	1
getting	1
somewhere	1
near	1
the	1
centre	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
Let	1
me	1
see:	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
four	1
thousand	1
miles	1
down,	1
I	1
think--'	1
(for,	1
you	1
see,	1
Alice	1
had	1
learnt	1
several	1
things	1
of	1
this	1
sort	1
in	1
her	1
lessons	1
in	1
the	1
schoolroom,	1
and	1
though	1
this	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
VERY	1
good	1
opportunity	1
for	1
showing	1
off	1
her	1
knowledge,	1
as	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
her,	1
still	1
it	1
was	1
good	1
practice	1
to	1
say	1
it	1
over)	1
'--yes,	1
that's	1
about	1
the	1
right	1
distance--but	1
then	1
I	1
wonder	1
what	1
Latitude	1
or	1
Longitude	1
I've	1
got	1
to?'	1
(Alice	1
had	1
no	1
idea	1
what	1
Latitude	1
was,	1
or	1
Longitude	1
either,	1
but	1
thought	1
they	1
were	1
nice	1
grand	1
words	1
to	1
say.)	1
Presently	1
she	1
began	1
again.	1
'I	1
wonder	1
if	1
I	1
shall	1
fall	1
right	1
THROUGH	1
the	1
earth!	1
How	1
funny	1
it'll	1
seem	1
to	1
come	1
out	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
walk	1
with	1
their	1
heads	1
downward!	1
The	1
Antipathies,	1
I	1
think--'	1
(she	1
was	1
rather	1
glad	1
there	1
WAS	1
no	1
one	1
listening,	1
this	1
time,	1
as	1
it	1
didn't	1
sound	1
at	1
all	1
the	1
right	1
word)	1
'--but	1
I	1
shall	1
have	1
to	1
ask	1
them	1
what	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
is,	1
you	1
know.	1
Please,	1
Ma'am,	1
is	1
this	1
New	1
Zealand	1
or	1
Australia?'	1
(and	1
she	1
tried	1
to	1
curtsey	1
as	1
she	1
spoke--fancy	1
CURTSEYING	1
as	1
you're	1
falling	1
through	1
the	1
air!	1
Do	1
you	1
think	1
you	1
could	1
manage	1
it?)	1
'And	1
what	1
an	1
ignorant	1
little	1
girl	1
she'll	1
think	1
me	1
for	1
asking!	1
No,	1
it'll	1
never	1
do	1
to	1
ask:	1
perhaps	1
I	1
shall	1
see	1
it	1
written	1
up	1
somewhere.'	1
Down,	1
down,	1
down.	1
There	1
was	1
nothing	1
else	1
to	1
do,	1
so	1
Alice	1
soon	1
began	1
talking	1
again.	1
'Dinah'll	1
miss	1
me	1
very	1
much	1
to-night,	1
I	1
should	1
think!'	1
(Dinah	1
was	1
the	1
cat.)	1
'I	1
hope	1
they'll	1
remember	1
her	1
saucer	1
of	1
milk	1
at	1
tea-time.	1
Dinah	1
my	1
dear!	1
I	1
wish	1
you	1
were	1
down	1
here	1
with	1
me!	1
There	1
are	1
no	1
mice	1
in	1
the	1
air,	1
I'm	1
afraid,	1
but	1
you	1
might	1
catch	1
a	1
bat,	1
and	1
that's	1
very	1
like	1
a	1
mouse,	1
you	1
know.	1
But	1
do	1
cats	1
eat	1
bats,	1
I	1
wonder?'	1
And	1
here	1
Alice	1
began	1
to	1
get	1
rather	1
sleepy,	1
and	1
went	1
on	1
saying	1
to	1
herself,	1
in	1
a	1
dreamy	1
sort	1
of	1
way,	1
'Do	1
cats	1
eat	1
bats?	1
Do	1
cats	1
eat	1
bats?'	1
and	1
sometimes,	1
'Do	1
bats	1
eat	1
cats?'	1
for,	1
you	1
see,	1
as	1
she	1
couldn't	1
answer	1
either	1
question,	1
it	1
didn't	1
much	1
matter	1
which	1
way	1
she	1
put	1
it.	1
She	1
felt	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
dozing	1
off,	1
and	1
had	1
just	1
begun	1
to	1
dream	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
walking	1
hand	1
in	1
hand	1
with	1
Dinah,	1
and	1
saying	1
to	1
her	1
very	1
earnestly,	1
'Now,	1
Dinah,	1
tell	1
me	1
the	1
truth:	1
did	1
you	1
ever	1
eat	1
a	1
bat?'	1
when	1
suddenly,	1
thump!	1
thump!	1
down	1
she	1
came	1
upon	1
a	1
heap	1
of	1
sticks	1
and	1
dry	1
leaves,	1
and	1
the	1
fall	1
was	1
over.	1
Alice	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
bit	1
hurt,	1
and	1
she	1
jumped	1
up	1
on	1
to	1
her	1
feet	1
in	1
a	1
moment:	1
she	1
looked	1
up,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
dark	1
overhead;	1
before	1
her	1
was	1
another	1
long	1
passage,	1
and	1
the	1
White	1
Rabbit	1
was	1
still	1
in	1
sight,	1
hurrying	1
down	1
it.	1
There	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
moment	1
to	1
be	1
lost:	1
away	1
went	1
Alice	1
like	1
the	1
wind,	1
and	1
was	1
just	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
hear	1
it	1
say,	1
as	1
it	1
turned	1
a	1
corner,	1
'Oh	1
my	1
ears	1
and	1
whiskers,	1
how	1
late	1
it's	1
getting!'	1
She	1
was	1
close	1
behind	1
it	1
when	1
she	1
turned	1
the	1
corner,	1
but	1
the	1
Rabbit	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
to	1
be	1
seen:	1
she	1
found	1
herself	1
in	1
a	1
long,	1
low	1
hall,	1
which	1
was	1
lit	1
up	1
by	1
a	1
row	1
of	1
lamps	1
hanging	1
from	1
the	1
roof.	1
There	1
were	1
doors	1
all	1
round	1
the	1
hall,	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
locked;	1
and	1
when	1
Alice	1
had	1
been	1
all	1
the	1
way	1
down	1
one	1
side	1
and	1
up	1
the	1
other,	1
trying	1
every	1
door,	1
she	1
walked	1
sadly	1
down	1
the	1
middle,	1
wondering	1
how	1
she	1
was	1
ever	1
to	1
get	1
out	1
again.	1
Suddenly	1
she	1
came	1
upon	1
a	1
little	1
three-legged	1
table,	1
all	1
made	1
of	1
solid	1
glass;	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
on	1
it	1
except	1
a	1
tiny	1
golden	1
key,	1
and	1
Alice's	1
first	1
thought	1
was	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
belong	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
doors	1
of	1
the	1
hall;	1
but,	1
alas!	1
either	1
the	1
locks	1
were	1
too	1
large,	1
or	1
the	1
key	1
was	1
too	1
small,	1
but	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
open	1
any	1
of	1
them.	1
However,	1
on	1
the	1
second	1
time	1
round,	1
she	1
came	1
upon	1
a	1
low	1
curtain	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
noticed	1
before,	1
and	1
behind	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
door	1
about	1
fifteen	1
inches	1
high:	1
she	1
tried	1
the	1
little	1
golden	1
key	1
in	1
the	1
lock,	1
and	1
to	1
her	1
great	1
delight	1
it	1
fitted!	1
Alice	1
opened	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
found	1
that	1
it	1
led	1
into	1
a	1
small	1
passage,	1
not	1
much	1
larger	1
than	1
a	1
rat-hole:	1
she	1
knelt	1
down	1
and	1
looked	1
along	1
the	1
passage	1
into	1
the	1
loveliest	1
garden	1
you	1
ever	1
saw.	1
How	1
she	1
longed	1
to	1
get	1
out	1
of	1
that	1
dark	1
hall,	1
and	1
wander	1
about	1
among	1
those	1
beds	1
of	1
bright	1
flowers	1
and	1
those	1
cool	1
fountains,	1
but	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
even	1
get	1
her	1
head	1
through	1
the	1
doorway;	1
'and	1
even	1
if	1
my	1
head	1
would	1
go	1
through,'	1
thought	1
poor	1
Alice,	1
'it	1
would	1
be	1
of	1
very	1
little	1
use	1
without	1
my	1
shoulders.	1
Oh,	1
how	1
I	1
wish	1
I	1
could	1
shut	1
up	1
like	1
a	1
telescope!	1
I	1
think	1
I	1
could,	1
if	1
I	1
only	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
begin.'	1
For,	1
you	1
see,	1
so	1
many	1
out-of-the-way	1
things	1
had	1
happened	1
lately,	1
that	1
Alice	1
had	1
begun	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
very	1
few	1
things	1
indeed	1
were	1
really	1
impossible.	1
There	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
no	1
use	1
in	1
waiting	1
by	1
the	1
little	1
door,	1
so	1
she	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
table,	1
half	1
hoping	1
she	1
might	1
find	1
another	1
key	1
on	1
it,	1
or	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
a	1
book	1
of	1
rules	1
for	1
shutting	1
people	1
up	1
like	1
telescopes:	1
this	1
time	1
she	1
found	1
a	1
little	1
bottle	1
on	1
it,	1
('which	1
certainly	1
was	1
not	1
here	1
before,'	1
said	1
Alice,)	1
and	1
round	1
the	1
neck	1
of	1
the	1
bottle	1
was	1
a	1
paper	1
label,	1
with	1
the	1
words	1
'DRINK	1
ME'	1
beautifully	1
printed	1
on	1
it	1
in	1
large	1
letters.	1
It	1
was	1
all	1
very	1
well	1
to	1
say	1
'Drink	1
me,'	1
but	1
the	1
wise	1
little	1
Alice	1
was	1
not	1
going	1
to	1
do	1
THAT	1
in	1
a	1
hurry.	1
'No,	1
I'll	1
look	1
first,'	1
she	1
said,	1
'and	1
see	1
whether	1
it's	1
marked	1
"poison"	1
or	1
not';	1
for	1
she	1
had	1
read	1
several	1
nice	1
little	1
histories	1
about	1
children	1
who	1
had	1
got	1
burnt,	1
and	1
eaten	1
up	1
by	1
wild	1
beasts	1
and	1
other	1
unpleasant	1
things,	1
all	1
because	1
they	1
WOULD	1
not	1
remember	1
the	1
simple	1
rules	1
their	1
friends	1
had	1
taught	1
them:	1
such	1
as,	1
that	1
a	1
red-hot	1
poker	1
will	1
burn	1
you	1
if	1
you	1
hold	1
it	1
too	1
long;	1
and	1
that	1
if	1
you	1
cut	1
your	1
finger	1
VERY	1
deeply	1
with	1
a	1
knife,	1
it	1
usually	1
bleeds;	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
never	1
forgotten	1
that,	1
if	1
you	1
drink	1
much	1
from	1
a	1
bottle	1
marked	1
'poison,'	1
it	1
is	1
almost	1
certain	1
to	1
disagree	1
with	1
you,	1
sooner	1
or	1
later.	1
However,	1
this	1
bottle	1
was	1
NOT	1
marked	1
'poison,'	1
so	1
Alice	1
ventured	1
to	1
taste	1
it,	1
and	1
finding	1
it	1
very	1
nice,	1
(it	1
had,	1
in	1
fact,	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
mixed	1
flavour	1
of	1
cherry-tart,	1
custard,	1
pine-apple,	1
roast	1
turkey,	1
toffee,	1
and	1
hot	1
buttered	1
toast,)	1
she	1
very	1
soon	1
finished	1
it	1
off.	1

'What	1
a	1
curious	1
feeling!'	1
said	1
Alice;	1
'I	1
must	1
be	1
shutting	1
up	1
like	1
a	1
telescope.'	1
And	1
so	1
it	1
was	1
indeed:	1
she	1
was	1
now	1
only	1
ten	1
inches	1
high,	1
and	1
her	1
face	1
brightened	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
thought	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
now	1
the	1
right	1
size	1
for	1
going	1
through	1
the	1
little	1
door	1
into	1
that	1
lovely	1
garden.	1
First,	1
however,	1
she	1
waited	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
to	1
see	1
if	1
she	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
shrink	1
any	1
further:	1
she	1
felt	1
a	1
little	1
nervous	1
about	1
this;	1
'for	1
it	1
might	1
end,	1
you	1
know,'	1
said	1
Alice	1
to	1
herself,	1
'in	1
my	1
going	1
out	1
altogether,	1
like	1
a	1
candle.	1
I	1
wonder	1
what	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
like	1
then?'	1
And	1
she	1
tried	1
to	1
fancy	1
what	1
the	1
flame	1
of	1
a	1
candle	1
is	1
like	1
after	1
the	1
candle	1
is	1
blown	1
out,	1
for	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
remember	1
ever	1
having	1
seen	1
such	1
a	1
thing.	1
After	1
a	1
while,	1
finding	1
that	1
nothing	1
more	1
happened,	1
she	1
decided	1
on	1
going	1
into	1
the	1
garden	1
at	1
once;	1
but,	1
alas	1
for	1
poor	1
Alice!	1
when	1
she	1
got	1
to	1
the	1
door,	1
she	1
found	1
she	1
had	1
forgotten	1
the	1
little	1
golden	1
key,	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
table	1
for	1
it,	1
she	1
found	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
possibly	1
reach	1
it:	1
she	1
could	1
see	1
it	1
quite	1
plainly	1
through	1
the	1
glass,	1
and	1
she	1
tried	1
her	1
best	1
to	1
climb	1
up	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
legs	1
of	1
the	1
table,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
too	1
slippery;	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
tired	1
herself	1
out	1
with	1
trying,	1
the	1
poor	1
little	1
thing	1
sat	1
down	1
and	1
cried.	1
'Come,	1
there's	1
no	1
use	1
in	1
crying	1
like	1
that!'	1
said	1
Alice	1
to	1
herself,	1
rather	1
sharply;	1
'I	1
advise	1
you	1
to	1
leave	1
off	1
this	1
minute!'	1
She	1
generally	1
gave	1
herself	1
very	1
good	1
advice,	1
(though	1
she	1
very	1
seldom	1
followed	1
it),	1
and	1
sometimes	1
she	1
scolded	1
herself	1
so	1
severely	1
as	1
to	1
bring	1
tears	1
into	1
her	1
eyes;	1
and	1
once	1
she	1
remembered	1
trying	1
to	1
box	1
her	1
own	1
ears	1
for	1
having	1
cheated	1
herself	1
in	1
a	1
game	1
of	1
croquet	1
she	1
was	1
playing	1
against	1
herself,	1
for	1
this	1
curious	1
child	1
was	1
very	1
fond	1
of	1
pretending	1
to	1
be	1
two	1
people.	1
'But	1
it's	1
no	1
use	1
now,'	1
thought	1
poor	1
Alice,	1
'to	1
pretend	1
to	1
be	1
two	1
people!	1
Why,	1
there's	1
hardly	1
enough	1
of	1
me	1
left	1
to	1
make	1
ONE	1
respectable	1
person!'	1
Soon	1
her	1
eye	1
fell	1
on	1
a	1
little	1
glass	1
box	1
that	1
was	1
lying	1
under	1
the	1
table:	1
she	1
opened	1
it,	1
and	1
found	1
in	1
it	1
a	1
very	1
small	1
cake,	1
on	1
which	1
the	1
words	1
'EAT	1
ME'	1
were	1
beautifully	1
marked	1
in	1
currants.	1
'Well,	1
I'll	1
eat	1
it,'	1
said	1
Alice,	1
'and	1
if	1
it	1
makes	1
me	1
grow	1
larger,	1
I	1
can	1
reach	1
the	1
key;	1
and	1
if	1
it	1
makes	1
me	1
grow	1
smaller,	1
I	1
can	1
creep	1
under	1
the	1
door;	1
so	1
either	1
way	1
I'll	1
get	1
into	1
the	1
garden,	1
and	1
I	1
don't	1
care	1
which	1
happens!'	1
She	1
ate	1
a	1
little	1
bit,	1
and	1
said	1
anxiously	1
to	1
herself,	1
'Which	1
way?	1
Which	1
way?',	1
holding	1
her	1
hand	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
her	1
head	1
to	1
feel	1
which	1
way	1
it	1
was	1
growing,	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
quite	1
surprised	1
to	1
find	1
that	1
she	1
remained	1
the	1
same	1
size:	1
to	1
be	1
sure,	1
this	1
generally	1
happens	1
when	1
one	1
eats	1
cake,	1
but	1
Alice	1
had	1
got	1
so	1
much	1
into	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
expecting	1
nothing	1
but	1
out-of-the-way	1
things	1
to	1
happen,	1
that	1
it	1
seemed	1
quite	1
dull	1
and	1
stupid	1
for	1
life	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
in	1
the	1
common	1
way.	1
So	1
she	1
set	1
to	1
work,	1
and	1
very	1
soon	1
finished	1
off	1
the	1
cake.	1

CHAPTER	1
II.	1
The	1
Pool	1
of	1
Tears	1
'Curiouser	1
and	1
curiouser!'	1
cried	1
Alice	1
(she	1
was	1
so	1
much	1
surprised,	1
that	1
for	1
the	1
moment	1
she	1
quite	1
forgot	1
how	1
to	1
speak	1
good	1
English);	1
'now	1
I'm	1
opening	1
out	1
like	1
the	1
largest	1
telescope	1
that	1
ever	1
was!	1
Good-bye,	1
feet!'	1
(for	1
when	1
she	1
looked	1
down	1
at	1
her	1
feet,	1
they	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
almost	1
out	1
of	1
sight,	1
they	1
were	1
getting	1
so	1
far	1
off).	1
'Oh,	1
my	1
poor	1
little	1
feet,	1
I	1
wonder	1
who	1
will	1
put	1
on	1
your	1
shoes	1
and	1
stockings	1
for	1
you	1
now,	1
dears?	1
I'm	1
sure	1
_I_	1
shan't	1
be	1
able!	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
too	1
far	1
off	1
to	1
trouble	1
myself	1
about	1
you:	1
you	1
must	1
manage	1
the	1
best	1
way	1
you	1
can;--but	1
I	1
must	1
be	1
kind	1
to	1
them,'	1
thought	1
Alice,	1
'or	1
perhaps	1
they	1
won't	1
walk	1
the	1
way	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
go!	1
Let	1
me	1
see:	1
I'll	1
give	1
them	1
a	1
new	1
pair	1
of	1
boots	1
every	1
Christmas.'	1
And	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
planning	1
to	1
herself	1
how	1
she	1
would	1
manage	1
it.	1
'They	1
must	1
go	1
by	1
the	1
carrier,'	1
she	1
thought;	1
'and	1
how	1
funny	1
it'll	1
seem,	1
sending	1
presents	1
to	1
one's	1
own	1
feet!	1
And	1
how	1
odd	1
the	1
directions	1
will	1
look!	1
ALICE'S	1
RIGHT	1
FOOT,	1
ESQ.	1
HEARTHRUG,	1
NEAR	1
THE	1
FENDER,	1
(WITH	1
ALICE'S	1
LOVE).	1
Oh	1
dear,	1
what	1
nonsense	1
I'm	1
talking!'	1
Just	1
then	1
her	1
head	1
struck	1
against	1
the	1
roof	1
of	1
the	1
hall:	1
in	1
fact	1
she	1
was	1
now	1
more	1
than	1
nine	1
feet	1
high,	1
and	1
she	1
at	1
once	1
took	1
up	1
the	1
little	1
golden	1
key	1
and	1
hurried	1
off	1
to	1
the	1
garden	1
door.	1
Poor	1
Alice!	1
It	1
was	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
she	1
could	1
do,	1
lying	1
down	1
on	1
one	1
side,	1
to	1
look	1
through	1
into	1
the	1
garden	1
with	1
one	1
eye;	1
but	1
to	1
get	1
through	1
was	1
more	1
hopeless	1
than	1
ever:	1
she	1
sat	1
down	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
cry	1
again.	1
'You	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
ashamed	1
of	1
yourself,'	1
said	1
Alice,	1
'a	1
great	1
girl	1
like	1
you,'	1
(she	1
might	1
well	1
say	1
this),	1
'to	1
go	1
on	1
crying	1
in	1
this	1
way!	1
Stop	1
this	1
moment,	1
I	1
tell	1
you!'	1
But	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
all	1
the	1
same,	1
shedding	1
gallons	1
of	1
tears,	1
until	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
large	1
pool	1
all	1
round	1
her,	1
about	1
four	1
inches	1
deep	1
and	1
reaching	1
half	1
down	1
the	1
hall.	1
After	1
a	1
time	1
she	1
heard	1
a	1
little	1
pattering	1
of	1
feet	1
in	1
the	1
distance,	1
and	1
she	1
hastily	1
dried	1
her	1
eyes	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
was	1
coming.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
White	1
Rabbit	1
returning,	1
splendidly	1
dressed,	1
with	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
white	1
kid	1
gloves	1
in	1
one	1
hand	1
and	1
a	1
large	1
fan	1
in	1
the	1
other:	1
he	1
came	1
trotting	1
along	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
hurry,	1
muttering	1
to	1
himself	1
as	1
he	1
came,	1
'Oh!	1
the	1
Duchess,	1
the	1
Duchess!	1
Oh!	1
won't	1
she	1
be	1
savage	1
if	1
I've	1
kept	1
her	1
waiting!'	1
Alice	1
felt	1
so	1
desperate	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
ask	1
help	1
of	1
any	1
one;	1
so,	1
when	1
the	1
Rabbit	1
came	1
near	1
her,	1
she	1
began,	1
in	1
a	1
low,	1
timid	1
voice,	1
'If	1
you	1
please,	1
sir--'	1
The	1
Rabbit	1
started	1
violently,	1
dropped	1
the	1
white	1
kid	1
gloves	1
and	1
the	1
fan,	1
and	1
skurried	1
away	1
into	1
the	1
darkness	1
as	1
hard	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
go.	1
Alice	1
took	1
up	1
the	1
fan	1
and	1
gloves,	1
and,	1
as	1
the	1
hall	1
was	1
very	1
hot,	1
she	1
kept	1
fanning	1
herself	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
talking:	1
'Dear,	1
dear!	1
How	1
queer	1
everything	1
is	1
to-day!	1
And	1
yesterday	1
things	1
went	1
on	1
just	1
as	1
usual.	1
I	1
wonder	1
if	1
I've	1
been	1
changed	1
in	1
the	1
night?	1
Let	1
me	1
think:	1
was	1
I	1
the	1
same	1
when	1
I	1
got	1
up	1
this	1
morning?	1
I	1
almost	1
think	1
I	1
can	1
remember	1
feeling	1
a	1
little	1
different.	1
But	1
if	1
I'm	1
not	1
the	1
same,	1
the	1
next	1
question	1
is,	1
Who	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
am	1
I?	1
Ah,	1
THAT'S	1
the	1
great	1
puzzle!'	1
And	1
she	1
began	1
thinking	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
she	1
knew	1
that	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
age	1
as	1
herself,	1
to	1
see	1
if	1
she	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
changed	1
for	1
any	1
of	1
them.	1
'I'm	1
sure	1
I'm	1
not	1
Ada,'	1
she	1
said,	1
'for	1
her	1
hair	1
goes	1
in	1
such	1
long	1
ringlets,	1
and	1
mine	1
doesn't	1
go	1
in	1
ringlets	1
at	1
all;	1
and	1
I'm	1
sure	1
I	1
can't	1
be	1
Mabel,	1
for	1
I	1
know	1
all	1
sorts	1
of	1
things,	1
and	1
she,	1
oh!	1
she	1
knows	1
such	1
a	1
very	1
little!	1
Besides,	1
SHE'S	1
she,	1
and	1
I'm	1
I,	1
and--oh	1
dear,	1
how	1
puzzling	1
it	1
all	1
is!	1
I'll	1
try	1
if	1
I	1
know	1
all	1
the	1
things	1
I	1
used	1
to	1
know.	1
Let	1
me	1
see:	1
four	1
times	1
five	1
is	1
twelve,	1
and	1
four	1
times	1
six	1
is	1
thirteen,	1
and	1
four	1
times	1
seven	1
is--oh	1
dear!	1
I	1
shall	1
never	1
get	1
to	1
twenty	1
at	1
that	1
rate!	1
However,	1
the	1
Multiplication	1
Table	1
doesn't	1
signify:	1
let's	1
try	1
Geography.	1
London	1
is	1
the	1
capital	1
of	1
Paris,	1
and	1
Paris	1
is	1
the	1
capital	1
of	1
Rome,	1
and	1
Rome--no,	1
THAT'S	1
all	1
wrong,	1
I'm	1
certain!	1
I	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
changed	1
for	1
Mabel!	1
I'll	1
try	1
and	1
say	1
"How	1
doth	1
the	1
little--"'	1
and	1
she	1
crossed	1
her	1
hands	1
on	1
her	1
lap	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
were	1
saying	1
lessons,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
repeat	1
it,	1
but	1
her	1
voice	1
sounded	1
hoarse	1
and	1
strange,	1
and	1
the	1
words	1
did	1
not	1
come	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
they	1
used	1
to	1
do:--	1
'How	1
doth	1
the	1
little	1
crocodile	1
Improve	1
his	1
shining	1
tail,	1
And	1
pour	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
the	1
Nile	1
On	1
every	1
golden	1
scale!	1
'How	1
cheerfully	1
he	1
seems	1
to	1
grin,	1
How	1
neatly	1
spread	1
his	1
claws,	1
And	1
welcome	1
little	1
fishes	1
in	1
With	1
gently	1
smiling	1
jaws!'	1
'I'm	1
sure	1
those	1
are	1
not	1
the	1
right	1
words,'	1
said	1
poor	1
Alice,	1
and	1
her	1
eyes	1
filled	1
with	1
tears	1
again	1
as	1
she	1
went	1
on,	1
'I	1
must	1
be	1
Mabel	1
after	1
all,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
have	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
live	1
in	1
that	1
poky	1
little	1
house,	1
and	1
have	1
next	1
to	1
no	1
toys	1
to	1
play	1
with,	1
and	1
oh!	1
ever	1
so	1
many	1
lessons	1
to	1
learn!	1
No,	1
I've	1
made	1
up	1
my	1
mind	1
about	1
it;	1
if	1
I'm	1
Mabel,	1
I'll	1
stay	1
down	1
here!	1
It'll	1
be	1
no	1
use	1
their	1
putting	1
their	1
heads	1
down	1
and	1
saying	1
"Come	1
up	1
again,	1
dear!"	1
I	1
shall	1
only	1
look	1
up	1
and	1
say	1
"Who	1
am	1
I	1
then?	1
Tell	1
me	1
that	1
first,	1
and	1
then,	1
if	1
I	1
like	1
being	1
that	1
person,	1
I'll	1
come	1
up:	1
if	1
not,	1
I'll	1
stay	1
down	1
here	1
till	1
I'm	1
somebody	1
else"--but,	1
oh	1
dear!'	1
cried	1
Alice,	1
with	1
a	1
sudden	1
burst	1
of	1
tears,	1
'I	1
do	1
wish	1
they	1
WOULD	1
put	1
their	1
heads	1
down!	1
I	1
am	1
so	1
VERY	1
tired	1
of	1
being	1
all	1
alone	1
here!'	1
As	1
she	1
said	1
this	1
she	1
looked	1
down	1
at	1
her	1
hands,	1
and	1
was	1
surprised	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
put	1
on	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
Rabbit's	1
little	1
white	1
kid	1
gloves	1
while	1
she	1
was	1
talking.	1
'How	1
CAN	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
that?'	1
she	1
thought.	1
'I	1
must	1
be	1
growing	1
small	1
again.'	1
She	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
table	1
to	1
measure	1
herself	1
by	1
it,	1
and	1
found	1
that,	1
as	1
nearly	1
as	1
she	1
could	1
guess,	1
she	1
was	1
now	1
about	1
two	1
feet	1
high,	1
and	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
shrinking	1
rapidly:	1
she	1
soon	1
found	1
out	1
that	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
fan	1
she	1
was	1
holding,	1
and	1
she	1
dropped	1
it	1
hastily,	1
just	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
avoid	1
shrinking	1
away	1
altogether.	1
'That	1
WAS	1
a	1
narrow	1
escape!'	1
said	1
Alice,	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
frightened	1
at	1
the	1
sudden	1
change,	1
but	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
find	1
herself	1
still	1
in	1
existence;	1
'and	1
now	1
for	1
the	1
garden!'	1
and	1
she	1
ran	1
with	1
all	1
speed	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
little	1
door:	1
but,	1
alas!	1
the	1
little	1
door	1
was	1
shut	1
again,	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
golden	1
key	1
was	1
lying	1
on	1
the	1
glass	1
table	1
as	1
before,	1
'and	1
things	1
are	1
worse	1
than	1
ever,'	1
thought	1
the	1
poor	1
child,	1
'for	1
I	1
never	1
was	1
so	1
small	1
as	1
this	1
before,	1
never!	1
And	1
I	1
declare	1
it's	1
too	1
bad,	1
that	1
it	1
is!'	1
As	1
she	1
said	1
these	1
words	1
her	1
foot	1
slipped,	1
and	1
in	1
another	1
moment,	1
splash!	1
she	1
was	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
chin	1
in	1
salt	1
water.	1
Her	1
first	1
idea	1
was	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
somehow	1
fallen	1
into	1
the	1
sea,	1
'and	1
in	1
that	1
case	1
I	1
can	1
go	1
back	1
by	1
railway,'	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself.	1
(Alice	1
had	1
been	1
to	1
the	1
seaside	1
once	1
in	1
her	1
life,	1
and	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
general	1
conclusion,	1
that	1
wherever	1
you	1
go	1
to	1
on	1
the	1
English	1
coast	1
you	1
find	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
bathing	1
machines	1
in	1
the	1
sea,	1
some	1
children	1
digging	1
in	1
the	1
sand	1
with	1
wooden	1
spades,	1
then	1
a	1
row	1
of	1
lodging	1
houses,	1
and	1
behind	1
them	1
a	1
railway	1
station.)	1
However,	1
she	1
soon	1
made	1
out	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
pool	1
of	1
tears	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
wept	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
nine	1
feet	1
high.	1
'I	1
wish	1
I	1
hadn't	1
cried	1
so	1
much!'	1
said	1
Alice,	1
as	1
she	1
swam	1
about,	1
trying	1
to	1
find	1
her	1
way	1
out.	1
'I	1
shall	1
be	1
punished	1
for	1
it	1
now,	1
I	1
suppose,	1
by	1
being	1
drowned	1
in	1
my	1
own	1
tears!	1
That	1
WILL	1
be	1
a	1
queer	1
thing,	1
to	1
be	1
sure!	1
However,	1
everything	1
is	1
queer	1
to-day.'	1
Just	1
then	1
she	1
heard	1
something	1
splashing	1
about	1
in	1
the	1
pool	1
a	1
little	1
way	1
off,	1
and	1
she	1
swam	1
nearer	1
to	1
make	1
out	1
what	1
it	1
was:	1
at	1
first	1
she	1
thought	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
walrus	1
or	1
hippopotamus,	1
but	1
then	1
she	1
remembered	1
how	1
small	1
she	1
was	1
now,	1
and	1
she	1
soon	1
made	1
out	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
a	1
mouse	1
that	1
had	1
slipped	1
in	1
like	1
herself.	1
'Would	1
it	1
be	1
of	1
any	1
use,	1
now,'	1
thought	1
Alice,	1
'to	1
speak	1
to	1
this	1
mouse?	1
Everything	1
is	1
so	1
out-of-the-way	1
down	1
here,	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
think	1
very	1
likely	1
it	1
can	1
talk:	1
at	1
any	1
rate,	1
there's	1
no	1
harm	1
in	1
trying.'	1
So	1
she	1
began:	1
'O	1
Mouse,	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
the	1
way	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
pool?	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
tired	1
of	1
swimming	1
about	1
here,	1
O	1
Mouse!'	1
(Alice	1
thought	1
this	1
must	1
be	1
the	1
right	1
way	1
of	1
speaking	1
to	1
a	1
mouse:	1
she	1
had	1
never	1
done	1
such	1
a	1
thing	1
before,	1
but	1
she	1
remembered	1
having	1
seen	1
in	1
her	1
brother's	1
Latin	1
Grammar,	1
'A	1
mouse--of	1
a	1
mouse--to	1
a	1
mouse--a	1
mouse--O	1
mouse!')	1
The	1
Mouse	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
rather	1
inquisitively,	1
and	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
to	1
wink	1
with	1
one	1
of	1
its	1
little	1
eyes,	1
but	1
it	1
said	1
nothing.	1
'Perhaps	1
it	1
doesn't	1
understand	1
English,'	1
thought	1
Alice;	1
'I	1
daresay	1
it's	1
a	1
French	1
mouse,	1
come	1
over	1
with	1
William	1
the	1
Conqueror.'	1
(For,	1
with	1
all	1
her	1
knowledge	1
of	1
history,	1
Alice	1
had	1
no	1
very	1
clear	1
notion	1
how	1
long	1
ago	1
anything	1
had	1
happened.)	1
So	1
she	1
began	1
again:	1
'Ou	1
est	1
ma	1
chatte?'	1
which	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
sentence	1
in	1
her	1
French	1
lesson-book.	1
The	1
Mouse	1
gave	1
a	1
sudden	1
leap	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
water,	1
and	1
seemed	1
to	1
quiver	1
all	1
over	1
with	1
fright.	1
'Oh,	1
I	1
beg	1
your	1
pardon!'	1
cried	1
Alice	1
hastily,	1
afraid	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
hurt	1
the	1
poor	1
animal's	1
feelings.	1
'I	1
quite	1
forgot	1
you	1
didn't	1
like	1
cats.'	1
'Not	1
like	1
cats!'	1
cried	1
the	1
Mouse,	1
in	1
a	1
shrill,	1
passionate	1
voice.	1
'Would	1
YOU	1
like	1
cats	1
if	1
you	1
were	1
me?'	1
'Well,	1
perhaps	1
not,'	1
said	1
Alice	1
in	1
a	1
soothing	1
tone:	1
'don't	1
be	1
angry	1
about	1
it.	1
And	1
yet	1
I	1
wish	1
I	1
could	1
show	1
you	1
our	1
cat	1
Dinah:	1
I	1
think	1
you'd	1
take	1
a	1
fancy	1
to	1
cats	1
if	1
you	1
could	1
only	1
see	1
her.	1
She	1
is	1
such	1
a	1
dear	1
quiet	1
thing,'	1
Alice	1
went	1
on,	1
half	1
to	1
herself,	1
as	1
she	1
swam	1
lazily	1
about	1
in	1
the	1
pool,	1
'and	1
she	1
sits	1
purring	1
so	1
nicely	1
by	1
the	1
fire,	1
licking	1
her	1
paws	1
and	1
washing	1
her	1
face--and	1
she	1
is	1
such	1
a	1
nice	1
soft	1
thing	1
to	1
nurse--and	1
she's	1
such	1
a	1
capital	1
one	1
for	1
catching	1
mice--oh,	1
I	1
beg	1
your	1
pardon!'	1
cried	1
Alice	1
again,	1
for	1
this	1
time	1
the	1
Mouse	1
was	1
bristling	1
all	1
over,	1
and	1
she	1
felt	1
certain	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
really	1
offended.	1
'We	1
won't	1
talk	1
about	1
her	1
any	1
more	1
if	1
you'd	1
rather	1
not.'	1
'We	1
indeed!'	1
cried	1
the	1
Mouse,	1
who	1
was	1
trembling	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
his	1
tail.	1
'As	1
if	1
I	1
would	1
talk	1
on	1
such	1
a	1
subject!	1
Our	1
family	1
always	1
HATED	1
cats:	1
nasty,	1
low,	1
vulgar	1
things!	1
Don't	1
let	1
me	1
hear	1
the	1
name	1
again!'	1
'I	1
won't	1
indeed!'	1
said	1
Alice,	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
hurry	1
to	1
change	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
conversation.	1
'Are	1
you--are	1
you	1
fond--of--of	1
dogs?'	1
The	1
Mouse	1
did	1
not	1
answer,	1
so	1
Alice	1
went	1
on	1
eagerly:	1
'There	1
is	1
such	1
a	1
nice	1
little	1
dog	1
near	1
our	1
house	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
show	1
you!	1
A	1
little	1
bright-eyed	1
terrier,	1
you	1
know,	1
with	1
oh,	1
such	1
long	1
curly	1
brown	1
hair!	1
And	1
it'll	1
fetch	1
things	1
when	1
you	1
throw	1
them,	1
and	1
it'll	1
sit	1
up	1
and	1
beg	1
for	1
its	1
dinner,	1
and	1
all	1
sorts	1
of	1
things--I	1
can't	1
remember	1
half	1
of	1
them--and	1
it	1
belongs	1
to	1
a	1
farmer,	1
you	1
know,	1
and	1
he	1
says	1
it's	1
so	1
useful,	1
it's	1
worth	1
a	1
hundred	1
pounds!	1
He	1
says	1
it	1
kills	1
all	1
the	1
rats	1
and--oh	1
dear!'	1
cried	1
Alice	1
in	1
a	1
sorrowful	1
tone,	1
'I'm	1
afraid	1
I've	1
offended	1
it	1
again!'	1
For	1
the	1
Mouse	1
was	1
swimming	1
away	1
from	1
her	1
as	1
hard	1
as	1
it	1
could	1
go,	1
and	1
making	1
quite	1
a	1
commotion	1
in	1
the	1
pool	1
as	1
it	1
went.	1
So	1
she	1
called	1
softly	1
after	1
it,	1
'Mouse	1
dear!	1
Do	1
come	1
back	1
again,	1
and	1
we	1
won't	1
talk	1
about	1
cats	1
or	1
dogs	1
either,	1
if	1
you	1
don't	1
like	1
them!'	1
When	1
the	1
Mouse	1
heard	1
this,	1
it	1
turned	1
round	1
and	1
swam	1
slowly	1
back	1
to	1
her:	1
its	1
face	1
was	1
quite	1
pale	1
(with	1
passion,	1
Alice	1
thought),	1
and	1
it	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
trembling	1
voice,	1
'Let	1
us	1
get	1
to	1
the	1
shore,	1
and	1
then	1
I'll	1
tell	1
you	1
my	1
history,	1
and	1
you'll	1
understand	1
why	1
it	1
is	1
I	1
hate	1
cats	1
and	1
dogs.'	1
It	1
was	1
high	1
time	1
to	1
go,	1
for	1
the	1
pool	1
was	1
getting	1
quite	1
crowded	1
with	1
the	1
birds	1
and	1
animals	1
that	1
had	1
fallen	1
into	1
it:	1
there	1
were	1
a	1
Duck	1
and	1
a	1
Dodo,	1
a	1
Lory	1
and	1
an	1
Eaglet,	1
and	1
several	1
other	1
curious	1
creatures.	1
Alice	1
led	1
the	1
way,	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
party	1
swam	1
to	1
the	1
shore.	1
CHAPTER	1
III.	1
A	1
Caucus-Race	1
and	1
a	1
Long	1
Tale	1
They	1
were	1
indeed	1
a	1
queer-looking	1
party	1
that	1
assembled	1
on	1
the	1
bank--the	1
birds	1
with	1
draggled	1
feathers,	1
the	1
animals	1
with	1
their	1
fur	1
clinging	1
close	1
to	1
them,	1
and	1
all	1
dripping	1
wet,	1
cross,	1
and	1
uncomfortable.	1
The	1
first	1
question	1
of	1
course	1
was,	1
how	1
to	1
get	1
dry	1
again:	1
they	1
had	1
a	1
consultation	1
about	1
this,	1
and	1
after	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
it	1
seemed	1
quite	1
natural	1
to	1
Alice	1
to	1
find	1
herself	1
talking	1
familiarly	1
with	1
them,	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
known	1
them	1
all	1
her	1
life.	1
Indeed,	1
she	1
had	1
quite	1
a	1
long	1
argument	1
with	1
the	1
Lory,	1
who	1
at	1
last	1
turned	1
sulky,	1
and	1
would	1
only	1
say,	1
'I	1
am	1
older	1
than	1
you,	1
and	1
must	1
know	1
better';	1
and	1
this	1
Alice	1
would	1
not	1
allow	1
without	1
knowing	1
how	1
old	1
it	1
was,	1
and,	1
as	1
the	1
Lory	1
positively	1
refused	1
to	1
tell	1
its	1
age,	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
more	1
to	1
be	1
said.	1
At	1
last	1
the	1
Mouse,	1
who	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
person	1
of	1
authority	1
among	1
them,	1
called	1
out,	1
'Sit	1
down,	1
all	1
of	1
you,	1
and	1
listen	1
to	1
me!	1
I'LL	1
soon	1
make	1
you	1
dry	1
enough!'	1
They	1
all	1
sat	1
down	1
at	1
once,	1
in	1
a	1
large	1
ring,	1
with	1
the	1
Mouse	1
in	1
the	1
middle.	1
Alice	1
kept	1
her	1
eyes	1
anxiously	1
fixed	1
on	1
it,	1
for	1
she	1
felt	1
sure	1
she	1
would	1
catch	1
a	1
bad	1
cold	1
if	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
get	1
dry	1
very	1
soon.	1
'Ahem!'	1
said	1
the	1
Mouse	1
with	1
an	1
important	1
air,	1
'are	1
you	1
all	1
ready?	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
driest	1
thing	1
I	1
know.	1
Silence	1
all	1
round,	1
if	1
you	1
please!	1
"William	1
the	1
Conqueror,	1
whose	1
cause	1
was	1
favoured	1
by	1
the	1
pope,	1
was	1
soon	1
submitted	1
to	1
by	1
the	1
English,	1
who	1
wanted	1
leaders,	1
and	1
had	1
been	1
of	1
late	1
much	1
accustomed	1
to	1
usurpation	1
and	1
conquest.	1
Edwin	1
and	1
Morcar,	1
the	1
earls	1
of	1
Mercia	1
and	1
Northumbria--"'	1
'Ugh!'	1
said	1
the	1
Lory,	1
with	1
a	1
shiver.	1
'I	1
beg	1
your	1
pardon!'	1
said	1
the	1
Mouse,	1
frowning,	1
but	1
very	1
politely:	1
'Did	1
you	1
speak?'	1
'Not	1
I!'	1
said	1
the	1
Lory	1
hastily.	1
'I	1
thought	1
you	1
did,'	1
said	1
the	1
Mouse.	1
'--I	1
proceed.	1
"Edwin	1
and	1
Morcar,	1
the	1
earls	1
of	1
Mercia	1
and	1
Northumbria,	1
declared	1
for	1
him:	1
and	1
even	1
Stigand,	1
the	1
patriotic	1
archbishop	1
of	1
Canterbury,	1
found	1
it	1
advisable--"'	1
'Found	1
WHAT?'	1
said	1
the	1
Duck.	1
'Found	1
IT,'	1
the	1
Mouse	1
replied	1
rather	1
crossly:	1
'of	1
course	1
you	1
know	1
what	1
"it"	1
means.'	1
'I	1
know	1
what	1
"it"	1
means	1
well	1
enough,	1
when	1
I	1
find	1
a	1
thing,'	1
said	1
the	1
Duck:	1
'it's	1
generally	1
a	1
frog	1
or	1
a	1
worm.	1
The	1
question	1
is,	1
what	1
did	1
the	1
archbishop	1
find?'	1
The	1
Mouse	1
did	1
not	1
notice	1
this	1
question,	1
but	1
hurriedly	1
went	1
on,	1
'"--found	1
it	1
advisable	1
to	1
go	1
with	1
Edgar	1
Atheling	1
to	1
meet	1
William	1
and	1
offer	1
him	1
the	1
crown.	1
William's	1
conduct	1
at	1
first	1
was	1
moderate.	1
But	1
the	1
insolence	1
of	1
his	1
Normans--"	1
How	1
are	1
you	1
getting	1
on	1
now,	1
my	1
dear?'	1
it	1
continued,	1
turning	1
to	1
Alice	1
as	1
it	1
spoke.	1
'As	1
wet	1
as	1
ever,'	1
said	1
Alice	1
in	1
a	1
melancholy	1
tone:	1
'it	1
doesn't	1
seem	1
to	1
dry	1
me	1
at	1
all.'	1
'In	1
that	1
case,'	1
said	1
the	1
Dodo	1
solemnly,	1
rising	1
to	1
its	1
feet,	1
'I	1
move	1
that	1
the	1
meeting	1
adjourn,	1
for	1
the	1
immediate	1
adoption	1
of	1
more	1
energetic	1
remedies--'	1
'Speak	1
English!'	1
said	1
the	1
Eaglet.	1
'I	1
don't	1
know	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
half	1
those	1
long	1
words,	1
and,	1
what's	1
more,	1
I	1
don't	1
believe	1
you	1
do	1
either!'	1
And	1
the	1
Eaglet	1
bent	1
down	1
its	1
head	1
to	1
hide	1
a	1
smile:	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
birds	1
tittered	1
audibly.	1
'What	1
I	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
say,'	1
said	1
the	1
Dodo	1
in	1
an	1
offended	1
tone,	1
'was,	1
that	1
the	1
best	1
thing	1
to	1
get	1
us	1
dry	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
Caucus-race.'	1
'What	1
IS	1
a	1
Caucus-race?'	1
said	1
Alice;	1
not	1
that	1
she	1
wanted	1
much	1
to	1
know,	1
but	1
the	1
Dodo	1
had	1
paused	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
thought	1
that	1
SOMEBODY	1
ought	1
to	1
speak,	1
and	1
no	1
one	1
else	1
seemed	1
inclined	1
to	1
say	1
anything.	1
'Why,'	1
said	1
the	1
Dodo,	1
'the	1
best	1
way	1
to	1
explain	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
do	1
it.'	1
(And,	1
as	1
you	1
might	1
like	1
to	1
try	1
the	1
thing	1
yourself,	1
some	1
winter	1
day,	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
you	1
how	1
the	1
Dodo	1
managed	1
it.)	1
First	1
it	1
marked	1
out	1
a	1
race-course,	1
in	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
circle,	1
('the	1
exact	1
shape	1
doesn't	1
matter,'	1
it	1
said,)	1
and	1
then	1
all	1
the	1
party	1
were	1
placed	1
along	1
the	1
course,	1
here	1
and	1
there.	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
'One,	1
two,	1
three,	1
and	1
away,'	1
but	1
they	1
began	1
running	1
when	1
they	1
liked,	1
and	1
left	1
off	1
when	1
they	1
liked,	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
easy	1
to	1
know	1
when	1
the	1
race	1
was	1
over.	1
However,	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
running	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
or	1
so,	1
and	1
were	1
quite	1
dry	1
again,	1
the	1
Dodo	1
suddenly	1
called	1
out	1
'The	1
race	1
is	1
over!'	1
and	1
they	1
all	1
crowded	1
round	1
it,	1
panting,	1
and	1
asking,	1
'But	1
who	1
has	1
won?'	1
This	1
question	1
the	1
Dodo	1
could	1
not	1
answer	1
without	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
thought,	1
and	1
it	1
sat	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
with	1
one	1
finger	1
pressed	1
upon	1
its	1
forehead	1
(the	1
position	1
in	1
which	1
you	1
usually	1
see	1
Shakespeare,	1
in	1
the	1
pictures	1
of	1
him),	1
while	1
the	1
rest	1
waited	1
in	1
silence.	1
At	1
last	1
the	1
Dodo	1
said,	1
'EVERYBODY	1
has	1
won,	1
and	1
all	1
must	1
have	1
prizes.'	1
'But	1
who	1
is	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
prizes?'	1
quite	1
a	1
chorus	1
of	1
voices	1
asked.	1
'Why,	1
SHE,	1
of	1
course,'	1
said	1
the	1
Dodo,	1
pointing	1
to	1
Alice	1
with	1
one	1
finger;	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
party	1
at	1
once	1
crowded	1
round	1
her,	1
calling	1
out	1
in	1
a	1
confused	1
way,	1
'Prizes!	1
Prizes!'	1
Alice	1
had	1
no	1
idea	1
what	1
to	1
do,	1
and	1
in	1
despair	1
she	1
put	1
her	1
hand	1
in	1
her	1
pocket,	1
and	1
pulled	1
out	1
a	1
box	1
of	1
comfits,	1
(luckily	1
the	1
salt	1
water	1
had	1
not	1
got	1
into	1
it),	1
and	1
handed	1
them	1
round	1
as	1
prizes.	1
There	1
was	1
exactly	1
one	1
a-piece	1
all	1
round.	1
'But	1
she	1
must	1
have	1
a	1
prize	1
herself,	1
you	1
know,'	1
said	1
the	1
Mouse.	1
'Of	1
course,'	1
the	1
Dodo	1
replied	1
very	1
gravely.	1
'What	1
else	1
have	1
you	1
got	1
in	1
your	1
pocket?'	1
he	1
went	1
on,	1
turning	1
to	1
Alice.	1
'Only	1
a	1
thimble,'	1
said	1
Alice	1
sadly.	1
'Hand	1
it	1
over	1
here,'	1
said	1
the	1
Dodo.	1
Then	1
they	1
all	1
crowded	1
round	1
her	1
once	1
more,	1
while	1
the	1
Dodo	1
solemnly	1
presented	1
the	1
thimble,	1
saying	1
'We	1
beg	1
your	1
acceptance	1
of	1
this	1
elegant	1
thimble';	1
and,	1
when	1
it	1
had	1
finished	1
this	1
short	1
speech,	1
they	1
all	1
cheered.	1
Alice	1
thought	1
the	1
whole	1
thing	1
very	1
absurd,	1
but	1
they	1
all	1
looked	1
so	1
grave	1
that	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
dare	1
to	1
laugh;	1
and,	1
as	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
think	1
of	1
anything	1
to	1
say,	1
she	1
simply	1
bowed,	1
and	1
took	1
the	1
thimble,	1
looking	1
as	1
solemn	1
as	1
she	1
could.	1
The	1
next	1
thing	1
was	1
to	1
eat	1
the	1
comfits:	1
this	1
caused	1
some	1
noise	1
and	1
confusion,	1
as	1
the	1
large	1
birds	1
complained	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
taste	1
theirs,	1
and	1
the	1
small	1
ones	1
choked	1
and	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
patted	1
on	1
the	1
back.	1
However,	1
it	1
was	1
over	1
at	1
last,	1
and	1
they	1
sat	1
down	1
again	1
in	1
a	1
ring,	1
and	1
begged	1
the	1
Mouse	1
to	1
tell	1
them	1
something	1
more.	1
'You	1
promised	1
to	1
tell	1
me	1
your	1
history,	1
you	1
know,'	1
said	1
Alice,	1
'and	1
why	1
it	1
is	1
you	1
hate--C	1
and	1
D,'	1
she	1
added	1
in	1
a	1
whisper,	1
half	1
afraid	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
offended	1
again.	1
'Mine	1
is	1
a	1
long	1
and	1
a	1
sad	1
tale!'	1
said	1
the	1
Mouse,	1
turning	1
to	1
Alice,	1
and	1
sighing.	1
'It	1
IS	1
a	1
long	1
tail,	1
certainly,'	1
said	1
Alice,	1
looking	1
down	1
with	1
wonder	1
at	1
the	1
Mouse's	1
tail;	1
'but	1
why	1
do	1
you	1
call	1
it	1
sad?'	1
And	1
she	1
kept	1
on	1
puzzling	1
about	1
it	1
while	1
the	1
Mouse	1
was	1
speaking,	1
so	1
that	1
her	1
idea	1
of	1
the	1
tale	1
was	1
something	1
like	1
this:--	1
'Fury	1
said	1
to	1
a	1
mouse,	1
That	1
he	1
met	1
in	1
the	1
house,	1
"Let	1
us	1
both	1
go	1
to	1
law:	1
I	1
will	1
prosecute	1
YOU.--Come,	1
I'll	1
take	1
no	1
denial;	1
We	1
must	1
have	1
a	1
trial:	1
For	1
really	1
this	1
morning	1
I've	1
nothing	1
to	1
do."	1
Said	1
the	1
mouse	1
to	1
the	1
cur,	1
"Such	1
a	1
trial,	1
dear	1
Sir,	1
With	1
no	1
jury	1
or	1
judge,	1
would	1
be	1
wasting	1
our	1
breath."	1
"I'll	1
be	1
judge,	1
I'll	1
be	1
jury,"	1
Said	1
cunning	1
old	1
Fury:	1
"I'll	1
try	1
the	1
whole	1
cause,	1
and	1
condemn	1
you	1
to	1
death."'	1
'You	1
are	1
not	1
attending!'	1
said	1
the	1
Mouse	1
to	1
Alice	1
severely.	1
'What	1
are	1
you	1
thinking	1
of?'	1
'I	1
beg	1
your	1
pardon,'	1
said	1
Alice	1
very	1
humbly:	1
'you	1
had	1
got	1
to	1
the	1
fifth	1
bend,	1
I	1
think?'	1
'I	1
had	1
NOT!'	1
cried	1
the	1
Mouse,	1
sharply	1
and	1
very	1
angrily.	1
'A	1
knot!'	1
said	1
Alice,	1
always	1
ready	1
to	1
make	1
herself	1
useful,	1
and	1
looking	1
anxiously	1
about	1
her.	1
'Oh,	1
do	1
let	1
me	1
help	1
to	1
undo	1
it!'	1
'I	1
shall	1
do	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
sort,'	1
said	1
the	1
Mouse,	1
getting	1
up	1
and	1
walking	1
away.	1
'You	1
insult	1
me	1
by	1
talking	1
such	1
nonsense!'	1
'I	1
didn't	1
mean	1
it!'	1
pleaded	1
poor	1
Alice.	1
'But	1
you're	1
so	1
easily	1
offended,	1
you	1
know!'	1
The	1
Mouse	1
only	1
growled	1
in	1
reply.	1
'Please	1
come	1
back	1
and	1
finish	1
your	1
story!'	1
Alice	1
called	1
after	1
it;	1
and	1
the	1
others	1
all	1
joined	1
in	1
chorus,	1
'Yes,	1
please	1
do!'	1
but	1
the	1
Mouse	1
only	1
shook	1
its	1
head	1
impatiently,	1
and	1
walked	1
a	1
little	1
quicker.	1
'What	1
a	1
pity	1
it	1
wouldn't	1
stay!'	1
sighed	1
the	1
Lory,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
quite	1
out	1
of	1
sight;	1
and	1
an	1
old	1
Crab	1
took	1
the	1
opportunity	1
of	1
saying	1
to	1
her	1
daughter	1
'Ah,	1
my	1
dear!	1
Let	1
this	1
be	1
a	1
lesson	1
to	1
you	1
never	1
to	1
lose	1
YOUR	1
temper!'	1
'Hold	1
your	1
tongue,	1
Ma!'	1
said	1
the	1
young	1
Crab,	1
a	1
little	1
snappishly.	1
'You're	1
enough	1
to	1
try	1
the	1
patience	1
of	1
an	1
oyster!'	1
'I	1
wish	1
I	1
had	1
our	1
Dinah	1
here,	1
I	1
know	1
I	1
do!'	1
said	1
Alice	1
aloud,	1
addressing	1
nobody	1
in	1
particular.	1
'She'd	1
soon	1
fetch	1
it	1
back!'	1
'And	1
who	1
is	1
Dinah,	1
if	1
I	1
might	1
venture	1
to	1
ask	1
the	1
question?'	1
said	1
the	1
Lory.	1
Alice	1
replied	1
eagerly,	1
for	1
she	1
was	1
always	1
ready	1
to	1
talk	1
about	1
her	1
pet:	1
'Dinah's	1
our	1
cat.	1
And	1
she's	1
such	1
a	1
capital	1
one	1
for	1
catching	1
mice	1
you	1
can't	1
think!	1
And	1
oh,	1
I	1
wish	1
you	1
could	1
see	1
her	1
after	1
the	1
birds!	1
Why,	1
she'll	1
eat	1
a	1
little	1
bird	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
look	1
at	1
it!'	1
This	1
speech	1
caused	1
a	1
remarkable	1
sensation	1
among	1
the	1
party.	1
Some	1
of	1
the	1
birds	1
hurried	1
off	1
at	1
once:	1
one	1
old	1
Magpie	1
began	1
wrapping	1
itself	1
up	1
very	1
carefully,	1
remarking,	1
'I	1
really	1
must	1
be	1
getting	1
home;	1
the	1
night-air	1
doesn't	1
suit	1
my	1
throat!'	1
and	1
a	1
Canary	1
called	1
out	1
in	1
a	1
trembling	1
voice	1
to	1
its	1
children,	1
'Come	1
away,	1
my	1
dears!	1
It's	1
high	1
time	1
you	1
were	1
all	1
in	1
bed!'	1
On	1
various	1
pretexts	1
they	1
all	1
moved	1
off,	1
and	1
Alice	1
was	1
soon	1
left	1
alone.	1
'I	1
wish	1
I	1
hadn't	1
mentioned	1
Dinah!'	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself	1
in	1
a	1
melancholy	1
tone.	1
'Nobody	1
seems	1
to	1
like	1
her,	1
down	1
here,	1
and	1
I'm	1
sure	1
she's	1
the	1
best	1
cat	1
in	1
the	1
world!	1
Oh,	1
my	1
dear	1
Dinah!	1
I	1
wonder	1
if	1
I	1
shall	1
ever	1
see	1
you	1
any	1
more!'	1
And	1
here	1
poor	1
Alice	1
began	1
to	1
cry	1
again,	1
for	1
she	1
felt	1
very	1
lonely	1
and	1
low-spirited.	1
In	1
a	1
little	1
while,	1
however,	1
she	1
again	1
heard	1
a	1
little	1
pattering	1
of	1
footsteps	1
in	1
the	1
distance,	1
and	1
she	1
looked	1
up	1
eagerly,	1
half	1
hoping	1
that	1
the	1
Mouse	1
had	1
changed	1
his	1
mind,	1
and	1
was	1
coming	1
back	1
to	1
finish	1
his	1
story.	1
CHAPTER	1
IV.	1
The	1
Rabbit	1
Sends	1
in	1
a	1
Little	1
Bill	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
White	1
Rabbit,	1
trotting	1
slowly	1
back	1
again,	1
and	1
looking	1
anxiously	1
about	1
as	1
it	1
went,	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
lost	1
something;	1
and	1
she	1
heard	1
it	1
muttering	1
to	1
itself	1
'The	1
Duchess!	1
The	1
Duchess!	1
Oh	1
my	1
dear	1
paws!	1
Oh	1
my	1
fur	1
and	1
whiskers!	1
She'll	1
get	1
me	1
executed,	1
as	1
sure	1
as	1
ferrets	1
are	1
ferrets!	1
Where	1
CAN	1
I	1
have	1
dropped	1
them,	1
I	1
wonder?'	1
Alice	1
guessed	1
in	1
a	1
moment	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
looking	1
for	1
the	1
fan	1
and	1
the	1
pair	1
of	1
white	1
kid	1
gloves,	1
and	1
she	1
very	1
good-naturedly	1
began	1
hunting	1
about	1
for	1
them,	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
nowhere	1
to	1
be	1
seen--everything	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
changed	1
since	1
her	1
swim	1
in	1
the	1
pool,	1
and	1
the	1
great	1
hall,	1
with	1
the	1
glass	1
table	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
door,	1
had	1
vanished	1
completely.	1
Very	1
soon	1
the	1
Rabbit	1
noticed	1
Alice,	1
as	1
she	1
went	1
hunting	1
about,	1
and	1
called	1
out	1
to	1
her	1
in	1
an	1
angry	1
tone,	1
'Why,	1
Mary	1
Ann,	1
what	1
ARE	1
you	1
doing	1
out	1
here?	1
Run	1
home	1
this	1
moment,	1
and	1
fetch	1
me	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
gloves	1
and	1
a	1
fan!	1
Quick,	1
now!'	1
And	1
Alice	1
was	1
so	1
much	1
frightened	1
that	1
she	1
ran	1
off	1
at	1
once	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
it	1
pointed	1
to,	1
without	1
trying	1
to	1
explain	1
the	1
mistake	1
it	1
had	1
made.	1
'He	1
took	1
me	1
for	1
his	1
housemaid,'	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself	1
as	1
she	1
ran.	1
'How	1
surprised	1
he'll	1
be	1
when	1
he	1
finds	1
out	1
who	1
I	1
am!	1
But	1
I'd	1
better	1
take	1
him	1
his	1
fan	1
and	1
gloves--that	1
is,	1
if	1
I	1
can	1
find	1
them.'	1
As	1
she	1
said	1
this,	1
she	1
came	1
upon	1
a	1
neat	1
little	1
house,	1
on	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
which	1
was	1
a	1
bright	1
brass	1
plate	1
with	1
the	1
name	1
'W.	1
RABBIT'	1
engraved	1
upon	1
it.	1
She	1
went	1
in	1
without	1
knocking,	1
and	1
hurried	1
upstairs,	1
in	1
great	1
fear	1
lest	1
she	1
should	1
meet	1
the	1
real	1
Mary	1
Ann,	1
and	1
be	1
turned	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
before	1
she	1
had	1
found	1
the	1
fan	1
and	1
gloves.	1
'How	1
queer	1
it	1
seems,'	1
Alice	1
said	1
to	1
herself,	1
'to	1
be	1
going	1
messages	1
for	1
a	1
rabbit!	1
I	1
suppose	1
Dinah'll	1
be	1
sending	1
me	1
on	1
messages	1
next!'	1
And	1
she	1
began	1
fancying	1
the	1
sort	1
of	1
thing	1
that	1
would	1
happen:	1
'"Miss	1
Alice!	1
Come	1
here	1
directly,	1
and	1
get	1
ready	1
for	1
your	1
walk!"	1
"Coming	1
in	1
a	1
minute,	1
nurse!	1
But	1
I've	1
got	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
the	1
mouse	1
doesn't	1
get	1
out."	1
Only	1
I	1
don't	1
think,'	1
Alice	1
went	1
on,	1
'that	1
they'd	1
let	1
Dinah	1
stop	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
if	1
it	1
began	1
ordering	1
people	1
about	1
like	1
that!'	1
By	1
this	1
time	1
she	1
had	1
found	1
her	1
way	1
into	1
a	1
tidy	1
little	1
room	1
with	1
a	1
table	1
in	1
the	1
window,	1
and	1
on	1
it	1
(as	1
she	1
had	1
hoped)	1
a	1
fan	1
and	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
pairs	1
of	1
tiny	1
white	1
kid	1
gloves:	1
she	1
took	1
up	1
the	1
fan	1
and	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
the	1
gloves,	1
and	1
was	1
just	1
going	1
to	1
leave	1
the	1
room,	1
when	1
her	1
eye	1
fell	1
upon	1
a	1
little	1
bottle	1
that	1
stood	1
near	1
the	1
looking-glass.	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
label	1
this	1
time	1
with	1
the	1
words	1
'DRINK	1
ME,'	1
but	1
nevertheless	1
she	1
uncorked	1
it	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
to	1
her	1
lips.	1
'I	1
know	1
SOMETHING	1
interesting	1
is	1
sure	1
to	1
happen,'	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself,	1
'whenever	1
I	1
eat	1
or	1
drink	1
anything;	1
so	1
I'll	1
just	1
see	1
what	1
this	1
bottle	1
does.	1
I	1
do	1
hope	1
it'll	1
make	1
me	1
grow	1
large	1
again,	1
for	1
really	1
I'm	1
quite	1
tired	1
of	1
being	1
such	1
a	1
tiny	1
little	1
thing!'	1
It	1
did	1
so	1
indeed,	1
and	1
much	1
sooner	1
than	1
she	1
had	1
expected:	1
before	1
she	1
had	1
drunk	1
half	1
the	1
bottle,	1
she	1
found	1
her	1
head	1
pressing	1
against	1
the	1
ceiling,	1
and	1
had	1
to	1
stoop	1
to	1
save	1
her	1
neck	1
from	1
being	1
broken.	1
She	1
hastily	1
put	1
down	1
the	1
bottle,	1
saying	1
to	1
herself	1
'That's	1
quite	1
enough--I	1
hope	1
I	1
shan't	1
grow	1
any	1
more--As	1
it	1
is,	1
I	1
can't	1
get	1
out	1
at	1
the	1
door--I	1
do	1
wish	1
I	1
hadn't	1
drunk	1
quite	1
so	1
much!'	1
Alas!	1
it	1
was	1
too	1
late	1
to	1
wish	1
that!	1
She	1
went	1
on	1
growing,	1
and	1
growing,	1
and	1
very	1
soon	1
had	1
to	1
kneel	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
floor:	1
in	1
another	1
minute	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
even	1
room	1
for	1
this,	1
and	1
she	1
tried	1
the	1
effect	1
of	1
lying	1
down	1
with	1
one	1
elbow	1
against	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
arm	1
curled	1
round	1
her	1
head.	1
Still	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
growing,	1
and,	1
as	1
a	1
last	1
resource,	1
she	1
put	1
one	1
arm	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window,	1
and	1
one	1
foot	1
up	1
the	1
chimney,	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
herself	1
'Now	1
I	1
can	1
do	1
no	1
more,	1
whatever	1
happens.	1
What	1
WILL	1
become	1
of	1
me?'	1
Luckily	1
for	1
Alice,	1
the	1
little	1
magic	1
bottle	1
had	1
now	1
had	1
its	1
full	1
effect,	1
and	1
she	1
grew	1
no	1
larger:	1
still	1
it	1
was	1
very	1
uncomfortable,	1
and,	1
as	1
there	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
no	1
sort	1
of	1
chance	1
of	1
her	1
ever	1
getting	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
again,	1
no	1
wonder	1
she	1
felt	1
unhappy.	1
'It	1
was	1
much	1
pleasanter	1
at	1
home,'	1
thought	1
poor	1
Alice,	1
'when	1
one	1
wasn't	1
always	1
growing	1
larger	1
and	1
smaller,	1
and	1
being	1
ordered	1
about	1
by	1
mice	1
and	1
rabbits.	1
I	1
almost	1
wish	1
I	1
hadn't	1
gone	1
down	1
that	1
rabbit-hole--and	1
yet--and	1
yet--it's	1
rather	1
curious,	1
you	1
know,	1
this	1
sort	1
of	1
life!	1
I	1
do	1
wonder	1
what	1
CAN	1
have	1
happened	1
to	1
me!	1
When	1
I	1
used	1
to	1
read	1
fairy-tales,	1
I	1
fancied	1
that	1
kind	1
of	1
thing	1
never	1
happened,	1
and	1
now	1
here	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
one!	1
There	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
book	1
written	1
about	1
me,	1
that	1
there	1
ought!	1
And	1
when	1
I	1
grow	1
up,	1
I'll	1
write	1
one--but	1
I'm	1
grown	1
up	1
now,'	1
she	1
added	1
in	1
a	1
sorrowful	1
tone;	1
'at	1
least	1
there's	1
no	1
room	1
to	1
grow	1
up	1
any	1
more	1
HERE.'	1
'But	1
then,'	1
thought	1
Alice,	1
'shall	1
I	1
NEVER	1
get	1
any	1
older	1
than	1
I	1
am	1
now?	1
That'll	1
be	1
a	1
comfort,	1
one	1
way--never	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
old	1
woman--but	1
then--always	1
to	1
have	1
lessons	1
to	1
learn!	1
Oh,	1
I	1
shouldn't	1
like	1
THAT!'	1
'Oh,	1
you	1
foolish	1
Alice!'	1
she	1
answered	1
herself.	1
'How	1
can	1
you	1
learn	1
lessons	1
in	1
here?	1
Why,	1
there's	1
hardly	1
room	1
for	1
YOU,	1
and	1
no	1
room	1
at	1
all	1
for	1
any	1
lesson-books!'	1
And	1
so	1
she	1
went	1
on,	1
taking	1
first	1
one	1
side	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
other,	1
and	1
making	1
quite	1
a	1
conversation	1
of	1
it	1
altogether;	1
but	1
after	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
she	1
heard	1
a	1
voice	1
outside,	1
and	1
stopped	1
to	1
listen.	1
'Mary	1
Ann!	1
Mary	1
Ann!'	1
said	1
the	1
voice.	1
'Fetch	1
me	1
my	1
gloves	1
this	1
moment!'	1
Then	1
came	1
a	1
little	1
pattering	1
of	1
feet	1
on	1
the	1
stairs.	1
Alice	1
knew	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
Rabbit	1
coming	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
her,	1
and	1
she	1
trembled	1
till	1
she	1
shook	1
the	1
house,	1
quite	1
forgetting	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
now	1
about	1
a	1
thousand	1
times	1
as	1
large	1
as	1
the	1
Rabbit,	1
and	1
had	1
no	1
reason	1
to	1
be	1
afraid	1
of	1
it.	1
Presently	1
the	1
Rabbit	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
open	1
it;	1
but,	1
as	1
the	1
door	1
opened	1
inwards,	1
and	1
Alice's	1
elbow	1
was	1
pressed	1
hard	1
against	1
it,	1
that	1
attempt	1
proved	1
a	1
failure.	1
Alice	1
heard	1
it	1
say	1
to	1
itself	1
'Then	1
I'll	1
go	1
round	1
and	1
get	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
window.'	1
'THAT	1
you	1
won't'	1
thought	1
Alice,	1
and,	1
after	1
waiting	1
till	1
she	1
fancied	1
she	1
heard	1
the	1
Rabbit	1
just	1
under	1
the	1
window,	1
she	1
suddenly	1
spread	1
out	1
her	1
hand,	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
snatch	1
in	1
the	1
air.	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
get	1
hold	1
of	1
anything,	1
but	1
she	1
heard	1
a	1
little	1
shriek	1
and	1
a	1
fall,	1
and	1
a	1
crash	1
of	1
broken	1
glass,	1
from	1
which	1
she	1
concluded	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
just	1
possible	1
it	1
had	1
fallen	1
into	1
a	1
cucumber-frame,	1
or	1
something	1
of	1
the	1
sort.	1
Next	1
came	1
an	1
angry	1
voice--the	1
Rabbit's--'Pat!	1
Pat!	1
Where	1
are	1
you?'	1
And	1
then	1
a	1
voice	1
she	1
had	1
never	1
heard	1
before,	1
'Sure	1
then	1
I'm	1
here!	1
Digging	1
for	1
apples,	1
yer	1
honour!'	1
'Digging	1
for	1
apples,	1
indeed!'	1
said	1
the	1
Rabbit	1
angrily.	1
'Here!	1
Come	1
and	1
help	1
me	1
out	1
of	1
THIS!'	1
(Sounds	1
of	1
more	1
broken	1
glass.)	1
'Now	1
tell	1
me,	1
Pat,	1
what's	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
window?'	1
'Sure,	1
it's	1
an	1
arm,	1
yer	1
honour!'	1
(He	1
pronounced	1
it	1
'arrum.')	1
'An	1
arm,	1
you	1
goose!	1
Who	1
ever	1
saw	1
one	1
that	1
size?	1
Why,	1
it	1
fills	1
the	1
whole	1
window!'	1
'Sure,	1
it	1
does,	1
yer	1
honour:	1
but	1
it's	1
an	1
arm	1
for	1
all	1
that.'	1
'Well,	1
it's	1
got	1
no	1
business	1
there,	1
at	1
any	1
rate:	1
go	1
and	1
take	1
it	1
away!'	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
long	1
silence	1
after	1
this,	1
and	1
Alice	1
could	1
only	1
hear	1
whispers	1
now	1
and	1
then;	1
such	1
as,	1
'Sure,	1
I	1
don't	1
like	1
it,	1
yer	1
honour,	1
at	1
all,	1
at	1
all!'	1
'Do	1
as	1
I	1
tell	1
you,	1
you	1
coward!'	1
and	1
at	1
last	1
she	1
spread	1
out	1
her	1
hand	1
again,	1
and	1
made	1
another	1
snatch	1
in	1
the	1
air.	1
This	1
time	1
there	1
were	1
TWO	1
little	1
shrieks,	1
and	1
more	1
sounds	1
of	1
broken	1
glass.	1
'What	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
cucumber-frames	1
there	1
must	1
be!'	1
thought	1
Alice.	1
'I	1
wonder	1
what	1
they'll	1
do	1
next!	1
As	1
for	1
pulling	1
me	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window,	1
I	1
only	1
wish	1
they	1
COULD!	1
I'm	1
sure	1
I	1
don't	1
want	1
to	1
stay	1
in	1
here	1
any	1
longer!'	1
She	1
waited	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
without	1
hearing	1
anything	1
more:	1
at	1
last	1
came	1
a	1
rumbling	1
of	1
little	1
cartwheels,	1
and	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
a	1
good	1
many	1
voices	1
all	1
talking	1
together:	1
she	1
made	1
out	1
the	1
words:	1
'Where's	1
the	1
other	1
ladder?--Why,	1
I	1
hadn't	1
to	1
bring	1
but	1
one;	1
Bill's	1
got	1
the	1
other--Bill!	1
fetch	1
it	1
here,	1
lad!--Here,	1
put	1
'em	1
up	1
at	1
this	1
corner--No,	1
tie	1
'em	1
together	1
first--they	1
don't	1
reach	1
half	1
high	1
enough	1
yet--Oh!	1
they'll	1
do	1
well	1
enough;	1
don't	1
be	1
particular--Here,	1
Bill!	1
catch	1
hold	1
of	1
this	1
rope--Will	1
the	1
roof	1
bear?--Mind	1
that	1
loose	1
slate--Oh,	1
it's	1
coming	1
down!	1
Heads	1
below!'	1
(a	1
loud	1
crash)--'Now,	1
who	1
did	1
that?--It	1
was	1
Bill,	1
I	1
fancy--Who's	1
to	1
go	1
down	1
the	1
chimney?--Nay,	1
I	1
shan't!	1
YOU	1
do	1
it!--That	1
I	1
won't,	1
then!--Bill's	1
to	1
go	1
down--Here,	1
Bill!	1
the	1
master	1
says	1
you're	1
to	1
go	1
down	1
the	1
chimney!'	1
'Oh!	1
So	1
Bill's	1
got	1
to	1
come	1
down	1
the	1
chimney,	1
has	1
he?'	1
said	1
Alice	1
to	1
herself.	1
'Shy,	1
they	1
seem	1
to	1
put	1
everything	1
upon	1
Bill!	1
I	1
wouldn't	1
be	1
in	1
Bill's	1
place	1
for	1
a	1
good	1
deal:	1
this	1
fireplace	1
is	1
narrow,	1
to	1
be	1
sure;	1
but	1
I	1
THINK	1
I	1
can	1
kick	1
a	1
little!'	1
She	1
drew	1
her	1
foot	1
as	1
far	1
down	1
the	1
chimney	1
as	1
she	1
could,	1
and	1
waited	1
till	1
she	1
heard	1
a	1
little	1
animal	1
(she	1
couldn't	1
guess	1
of	1
what	1
sort	1
it	1
was)	1
scratching	1
and	1
scrambling	1
about	1
in	1
the	1
chimney	1
close	1
above	1
her:	1
then,	1
saying	1
to	1
herself	1
'This	1
is	1
Bill,'	1
she	1
gave	1
one	1
sharp	1
kick,	1
and	1
waited	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
would	1
happen	1
next.	1
The	1
first	1
thing	1
she	1
heard	1
was	1
a	1
general	1
chorus	1
of	1
'There	1
goes	1
Bill!'	1
then	1
the	1
Rabbit's	1
voice	1
along--'Catch	1
him,	1
you	1
by	1
the	1
hedge!'	1
then	1
silence,	1
and	1
then	1
another	1
confusion	1
of	1
voices--'Hold	1
up	1
his	1
head--Brandy	1
now--Don't	1
choke	1
him--How	1
was	1
it,	1
old	1
fellow?	1
What	1
happened	1
to	1
you?	1
Tell	1
us	1
all	1
about	1
it!'	1
Last	1
came	1
a	1
little	1
feeble,	1
squeaking	1
voice,	1
('That's	1
Bill,'	1
thought	1
Alice,)	1
'Well,	1
I	1
hardly	1
know--No	1
more,	1
thank	1
ye;	1
I'm	1
better	1
now--but	1
I'm	1
a	1
deal	1
too	1
flustered	1
to	1
tell	1
you--all	1
I	1
know	1
is,	1
something	1
comes	1
at	1
me	1
like	1
a	1
Jack-in-the-box,	1
and	1
up	1
I	1
goes	1
like	1
a	1
sky-rocket!'	1
'So	1
you	1
did,	1
old	1
fellow!'	1
said	1
the	1
others.	1
'We	1
must	1
burn	1
the	1
house	1
down!'	1
said	1
the	1
Rabbit's	1
voice;	1
and	1
Alice	1
called	1
out	1
as	1
loud	1
as	1
she	1
could,	1
'If	1
you	1
do.	1
I'll	1
set	1
Dinah	1
at	1
you!'	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
dead	1
silence	1
instantly,	1
and	1
Alice	1
thought	1
to	1
herself,	1
'I	1
wonder	1
what	1
they	1
WILL	1
do	1
next!	1
If	1
they	1
had	1
any	1
sense,	1
they'd	1
take	1
the	1
roof	1
off.'	1
After	1
a	1
minute	1
or	1
two,	1
they	1
began	1
moving	1
about	1
again,	1
and	1
Alice	1
heard	1
the	1
Rabbit	1
say,	1
'A	1
barrowful	1
will	1
do,	1
to	1
begin	1
with.'	1
'A	1
barrowful	1
of	1
WHAT?'	1
thought	1
Alice;	1
but	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
long	1
to	1
doubt,	1
for	1
the	1
next	1
moment	1
a	1
shower	1
of	1
little	1
pebbles	1
came	1
rattling	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
window,	1
and	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
hit	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
face.	1
'I'll	1
put	1
a	1
stop	1
to	1
this,'	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself,	1
and	1
shouted	1
out,	1
'You'd	1
better	1
not	1
do	1
that	1
again!'	1
which	1
produced	1
another	1
dead	1
silence.	1
Alice	1
noticed	1
with	1
some	1
surprise	1
that	1
the	1
pebbles	1
were	1
all	1
turning	1
into	1
little	1
cakes	1
as	1
they	1
lay	1
on	1
the	1
floor,	1
and	1
a	1
bright	1
idea	1
came	1
into	1
her	1
head.	1
'If	1
I	1
eat	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
cakes,'	1
she	1
thought,	1
'it's	1
sure	1
to	1
make	1
SOME	1
change	1
in	1
my	1
size;	1
and	1
as	1
it	1
can't	1
possibly	1
make	1
me	1
larger,	1
it	1
must	1
make	1
me	1
smaller,	1
I	1
suppose.'	1
So	1
she	1
swallowed	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
cakes,	1
and	1
was	1
delighted	1
to	1
find	1
that	1
she	1
began	1
shrinking	1
directly.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
small	1
enough	1
to	1
get	1
through	1
the	1
door,	1
she	1
ran	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
found	1
quite	1
a	1
crowd	1
of	1
little	1
animals	1
and	1
birds	1
waiting	1
outside.	1
The	1
poor	1
little	1
Lizard,	1
Bill,	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
middle,	1
being	1
held	1
up	1
by	1
two	1
guinea-pigs,	1
who	1
were	1
giving	1
it	1
something	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
bottle.	1
They	1
all	1
made	1
a	1
rush	1
at	1
Alice	1
the	1
moment	1
she	1
appeared;	1
but	1
she	1
ran	1
off	1
as	1
hard	1
as	1
she	1
could,	1
and	1
soon	1
found	1
herself	1
safe	1
in	1
a	1
thick	1
wood.	1
'The	1
first	1
thing	1
I've	1
got	1
to	1
do,'	1
said	1
Alice	1
to	1
herself,	1
as	1
she	1
wandered	1
about	1
in	1
the	1
wood,	1
'is	1
to	1
grow	1
to	1
my	1
right	1
size	1
again;	1
and	1
the	1
second	1
thing	1
is	1
to	1
find	1
my	1
way	1
into	1
that	1
lovely	1
garden.	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
best	1
plan.'	1
It	1
sounded	1
an	1
excellent	1
plan,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
and	1
very	1
neatly	1
and	1
simply	1
arranged;	1
the	1
only	1
difficulty	1
was,	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
smallest	1
idea	1
how	1
to	1
set	1
about	1
it;	1
and	1
while	1
she	1
was	1
peering	1
about	1
anxiously	1
among	1
the	1
trees,	1
a	1
little	1
sharp	1
bark	1
just	1
over	1
her	1
head	1
made	1
her	1
look	1
up	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
hurry.	1
An	1
enormous	1
puppy	1
was	1
looking	1
down	1
at	1
her	1
with	1
large	1
round	1
eyes,	1
and	1
feebly	1
stretching	1
out	1
one	1
paw,	1
trying	1
to	1
touch	1
her.	1
'Poor	1
little	1
thing!'	1
said	1
Alice,	1
in	1
a	1
coaxing	1
tone,	1
and	1
she	1
tried	1
hard	1
to	1
whistle	1
to	1
it;	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
terribly	1
frightened	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
at	1
the	1
thought	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
hungry,	1
in	1
which	1
case	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
very	1
likely	1
to	1
eat	1
her	1
up	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
her	1
coaxing.	1
Hardly	1
knowing	1
what	1
she	1
did,	1
she	1
picked	1
up	1
a	1
little	1
bit	1
of	1
stick,	1
and	1
held	1
it	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
puppy;	1
whereupon	1
the	1
puppy	1
jumped	1
into	1
the	1
air	1
off	1
all	1
its	1
feet	1
at	1
once,	1
with	1
a	1
yelp	1
of	1
delight,	1
and	1
rushed	1
at	1
the	1
stick,	1
and	1
made	1
believe	1
to	1
worry	1
it;	1
then	1
Alice	1
dodged	1
behind	1
a	1
great	1
thistle,	1
to	1
keep	1
herself	1
from	1
being	1
run	1
over;	1
and	1
the	1
moment	1
she	1
appeared	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side,	1
the	1
puppy	1
made	1
another	1
rush	1
at	1
the	1
stick,	1
and	1
tumbled	1
head	1
over	1
heels	1
in	1
its	1
hurry	1
to	1
get	1
hold	1
of	1
it;	1
then	1
Alice,	1
thinking	1
it	1
was	1
very	1
like	1
having	1
a	1
game	1
of	1
play	1
with	1
a	1
cart-horse,	1
and	1
expecting	1
every	1
moment	1
to	1
be	1
trampled	1
under	1
its	1
feet,	1
ran	1
round	1
the	1
thistle	1
again;	1
then	1
the	1
puppy	1
began	1
a	1
series	1
of	1
short	1
charges	1
at	1
the	1
stick,	1
running	1
a	1
very	1
little	1
way	1
forwards	1
each	1
time	1
and	1
a	1
long	1
way	1
back,	1
and	1
barking	1
hoarsely	1
all	1
the	1
while,	1
till	1
at	1
last	1
it	1
sat	1
down	1
a	1
good	1
way	1
off,	1
panting,	1
with	1
its	1
tongue	1
hanging	1
out	1
of	1
its	1
mouth,	1
and	1
its	1
great	1
eyes	1
half	1
shut.	1
This	1
seemed	1
to	1
Alice	1
a	1
good	1
opportunity	1
for	1
making	1
her	1
escape;	1
so	1
she	1
set	1
off	1
at	1
once,	1
and	1
ran	1
till	1
she	1
was	1
quite	1
tired	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
breath,	1
and	1
till	1
the	1
puppy's	1
bark	1
sounded	1
quite	1
faint	1
in	1
the	1
distance.	1
'And	1
yet	1
what	1
a	1
dear	1
little	1
puppy	1
it	1
was!'	1
said	1
Alice,	1
as	1
she	1
leant	1
against	1
a	1
buttercup	1
to	1
rest	1
herself,	1
and	1
fanned	1
herself	1
with	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
leaves:	1
'I	1
should	1
have	1
liked	1
teaching	1
it	1
tricks	1
very	1
much,	1
if--if	1
I'd	1
only	1
been	1
the	1
right	1
size	1
to	1
do	1
it!	1
Oh	1
dear!	1
I'd	1
nearly	1
forgotten	1
that	1
I've	1
got	1
to	1
grow	1
up	1
again!	1
Let	1
me	1
see--how	1
IS	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
managed?	1
I	1
suppose	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
eat	1
or	1
drink	1
something	1
or	1
other;	1
but	1
the	1
great	1
question	1
is,	1
what?'	1
The	1
great	1
question	1
certainly	1
was,	1
what?	1
Alice	1
looked	1
all	1
round	1
her	1
at	1
the	1
flowers	1
and	1
the	1
blades	1
of	1
grass,	1
but	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
anything	1
that	1
looked	1
like	1
the	1
right	1
thing	1
to	1
eat	1
or	1
drink	1
under	1
the	1
circumstances.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
large	1
mushroom	1
growing	1
near	1
her,	1
about	1
the	1
same	1
height	1
as	1
herself;	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
looked	1
under	1
it,	1
and	1
on	1
both	1
sides	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
behind	1
it,	1
it	1
occurred	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
she	1
might	1
as	1
well	1
look	1
and	1
see	1
what	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
it.	1
She	1
stretched	1
herself	1
up	1
on	1
tiptoe,	1
and	1
peeped	1
over	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
mushroom,	1
and	1
her	1
eyes	1
immediately	1
met	1
those	1
of	1
a	1
large	1
caterpillar,	1
that	1
was	1
sitting	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
with	1
its	1
arms	1
folded,	1
quietly	1
smoking	1
a	1
long	1
hookah,	1
and	1
taking	1
not	1
the	1
smallest	1
notice	1
of	1
her	1
or	1
of	1
anything	1
else.	1
CHAPTER	1
V.	1
Advice	1
from	1
a	1
Caterpillar	1
The	1
Caterpillar	1
and	1
Alice	1
looked	1
at	1
each	1
other	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
in	1
silence:	1
at	1
last	1
the	1
Caterpillar	1
took	1
the	1
hookah	1
out	1
of	1
its	1
mouth,	1
and	1
addressed	1
her	1
in	1
a	1
languid,	1
sleepy	1
voice.	1
'Who	1
are	1
YOU?'	1
said	1
the	1
Caterpillar.	1
This	1
was	1
not	1
an	1
encouraging	1
opening	1
for	1
a	1
conversation.	1
Alice	1
replied,	1
rather	1
shyly,	1
'I--I	1
hardly	1
know,	1
sir,	1
just	1
at	1
present--at	1
least	1
I	1
know	1
who	1
I	1
WAS	1
when	1
I	1
got	1
up	1
this	1
morning,	1
but	1
I	1
think	1
I	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
changed	1
several	1
times	1
since	1
then.'	1
'What	1
do	1
you	1
mean	1
by	1
that?'	1
said	1
the	1
Caterpillar	1
sternly.	1
'Explain	1
yourself!'	1
'I	1
can't	1
explain	1
MYSELF,	1
I'm	1
afraid,	1
sir'	1
said	1
Alice,	1
'because	1
I'm	1
not	1
myself,	1
you	1
see.'	1
'I	1
don't	1
see,'	1
said	1
the	1
Caterpillar.	1
'I'm	1
afraid	1
I	1
can't	1
put	1
it	1
more	1
clearly,'	1
Alice	1
replied	1
very	1
politely,	1
'for	1
I	1
can't	1
understand	1
it	1
myself	1
to	1
begin	1
with;	1
and	1
being	1
so	1
many	1
different	1
sizes	1
in	1
a	1
day	1
is	1
very	1
confusing.'	1
'It	1
isn't,'	1
said	1
the	1
Caterpillar.	1
'Well,	1
perhaps	1
you	1
haven't	1
found	1
it	1
so	1
yet,'	1
said	1
Alice;	1
'but	1
when	1
you	1
have	1
to	1
turn	1
into	1
a	1
chrysalis--you	1
will	1
some	1
day,	1
you	1
know--and	1
then	1
after	1
that	1
into	1
a	1
butterfly,	1
I	1
should	1
think	1
you'll	1
feel	1
it	1
a	1
little	1
queer,	1
won't	1
you?'	1
'Not	1
a	1
bit,'	1
said	1
the	1
Caterpillar.	1
'Well,	1
perhaps	1
your	1
feelings	1
may	1
be	1
different,'	1
said	1
Alice;	1
'all	1
I	1
know	1
is,	1
it	1
would	1
feel	1
very	1
queer	1
to	1
ME.'	1
'You!'	1
said	1
the	1
Caterpillar	1
contemptuously.	1
'Who	1
are	1
YOU?'	1
Which	1
brought	1
them	1
back	1
again	1
to	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
conversation.	1
Alice	1
felt	1
a	1
little	1
irritated	1
at	1
the	1
Caterpillar's	1
making	1
such	1
VERY	1
short	1
remarks,	1
and	1
she	1
drew	1
herself	1
up	1
and	1
said,	1
very	1
gravely,	1
'I	1
think,	1
you	1
ought	1
to	1
tell	1
me	1
who	1
YOU	1
are,	1
first.'	1
'Why?'	1
said	1
the	1
Caterpillar.	1
Here	1
was	1
another	1
puzzling	1
question;	1
and	1
as	1
Alice	1
could	1
not	1
think	1
of	1
any	1
good	1
reason,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
Caterpillar	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
a	1
VERY	1
unpleasant	1
state	1
of	1
mind,	1
she	1
turned	1
away.	1
'Come	1
back!'	1
the	1
Caterpillar	1
called	1
after	1
her.	1
'I've	1
something	1
important	1
to	1
say!'	1
This	1
sounded	1
promising,	1
certainly:	1
Alice	1
turned	1
and	1
came	1
back	1
again.	1
'Keep	1
your	1
temper,'	1
said	1
the	1
Caterpillar.	1
'Is	1
that	1
all?'	1
said	1
Alice,	1
swallowing	1
down	1
her	1
anger	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
she	1
could.	1
'No,'	1
said	1
the	1
Caterpillar.	1
Alice	1
thought	1
she	1
might	1
as	1
well	1
wait,	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
nothing	1
else	1
to	1
do,	1
and	1
perhaps	1
after	1
all	1
it	1
might	1
tell	1
her	1
something	1
worth	1
hearing.	1
For	1
some	1
minutes	1
it	1
puffed	1
away	1
without	1
speaking,	1
but	1
at	1
last	1
it	1
unfolded	1
its	1
arms,	1
took	1
the	1
hookah	1
out	1
of	1
its	1
mouth	1
again,	1
and	1
said,	1
'So	1
you	1
think	1
you're	1
changed,	1
do	1
you?'	1
'I'm	1
afraid	1
I	1
am,	1
sir,'	1
said	1
Alice;	1
'I	1
can't	1
remember	1
things	1
as	1
I	1
used--and	1
I	1
don't	1
keep	1
the	1
same	1
size	1
for	1
ten	1
minutes	1
together!'	1
'Can't	1
remember	1
WHAT	1
things?'	1
said	1
the	1
Caterpillar.	1
'Well,	1
I've	1
tried	1
to	1
say	1
"HOW	1
DOTH	1
THE	1
LITTLE	1
BUSY	1
BEE,"	1
but	1
it	1
all	1
came	1
different!'	1
Alice	1
replied	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
melancholy	1
voice.	1
'Repeat,	1
"YOU	1
ARE	1
OLD,	1
FATHER	1
WILLIAM,"'	1
said	1
the	1
Caterpillar.	1
Alice	1
folded	1
her	1
hands,	1
and	1
began:--	1
'You	1
are	1
old,	1
Father	1
William,'	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
said,	1
'And	1
your	1
hair	1
has	1
become	1
very	1
white;	1
And	1
yet	1
you	1
incessantly	1
stand	1
on	1
your	1
head--	1
Do	1
you	1
think,	1
at	1
your	1
age,	1
it	1
is	1
right?'	1
'In	1
my	1
youth,'	1
Father	1
William	1
replied	1
to	1
his	1
son,	1
'I	1
feared	1
it	1
might	1
injure	1
the	1
brain;	1
But,	1
now	1
that	1
I'm	1
perfectly	1
sure	1
I	1
have	1
none,	1
Why,	1
I	1
do	1
it	1
again	1
and	1
again.'	1
'You	1
are	1
old,'	1
said	1
the	1
youth,	1
'as	1
I	1
mentioned	1
before,	1
And	1
have	1
grown	1
most	1
uncommonly	1
fat;	1
Yet	1
you	1
turned	1
a	1
back-somersault	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
door--	1
Pray,	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
reason	1
of	1
that?'	1
'In	1
my	1
youth,'	1
said	1
the	1
sage,	1
as	1
he	1
shook	1
his	1
grey	1
locks,	1
'I	1
kept	1
all	1
my	1
limbs	1
very	1
supple	1
By	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
this	1
ointment--one	1
shilling	1
the	1
box--	1
Allow	1
me	1
to	1
sell	1
you	1
a	1
couple?'	1
'You	1
are	1
old,'	1
said	1
the	1
youth,	1
'and	1
your	1
jaws	1
are	1
too	1
weak	1
For	1
anything	1
tougher	1
than	1
suet;	1
Yet	1
you	1
finished	1
the	1
goose,	1
with	1
the	1
bones	1
and	1
the	1
beak--	1
Pray	1
how	1
did	1
you	1
manage	1
to	1
do	1
it?'	1
'In	1
my	1
youth,'	1
said	1
his	1
father,	1
'I	1
took	1
to	1
the	1
law,	1
And	1
argued	1
each	1
case	1
with	1
my	1
wife;	1
And	1
the	1
muscular	1
strength,	1
which	1
it	1
gave	1
to	1
my	1
jaw,	1
Has	1
lasted	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
my	1
life.'	1
'You	1
are	1
old,'	1
said	1
the	1
youth,	1
'one	1
would	1
hardly	1
suppose	1
That	1
your	1
eye	1
was	1
as	1
steady	1
as	1
ever;	1
Yet	1
you	1
balanced	1
an	1
eel	1
on	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
your	1
nose--	1
What	1
made	1
you	1
so	1
awfully	1
clever?'	1
'I	1
have	1
answered	1
three	1
questions,	1
and	1
that	1
is	1
enough,'	1
Said	1
his	1
father;	1
'don't	1
give	1
yourself	1
airs!	1
Do	1
you	1
think	1
I	1
can	1
listen	1
all	1
day	1
to	1
such	1
stuff?	1
Be	1
off,	1
or	1
I'll	1
kick	1
you	1
down	1
stairs!'	1
'That	1
is	1
not	1
said	1
right,'	1
said	1
the	1
Caterpillar.	1
'Not	1
QUITE	1
right,	1
I'm	1
afraid,'	1
said	1
Alice,	1
timidly;	1
'some	1
of	1
the	1
words	1
have	1
got	1
altered.'	1
'It	1
is	1
wrong	1
from	1
beginning	1
to	1
end,'	1
said	1
the	1
Caterpillar	1
decidedly,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
silence	1
for	1
some	1
minutes.	1
The	1
Caterpillar	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
speak.	1
'What	1
size	1
do	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
be?'	1
it	1
asked.	1
'Oh,	1
I'm	1
not	1
particular	1
as	1
to	1
size,'	1
Alice	1
hastily	1
replied;	1
'only	1
one	1
doesn't	1
like	1
changing	1
so	1
often,	1
you	1
know.'	1
'I	1
DON'T	1
know,'	1
said	1
the	1
Caterpillar.	1
Alice	1
said	1
nothing:	1
she	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
so	1
much	1
contradicted	1
in	1
her	1
life	1
before,	1
and	1
she	1
felt	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
losing	1
her	1
temper.	1
'Are	1
you	1
content	1
now?'	1
said	1
the	1
Caterpillar.	1
'Well,	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
LITTLE	1
larger,	1
sir,	1
if	1
you	1
wouldn't	1
mind,'	1
said	1
Alice:	1
'three	1
inches	1
is	1
such	1
a	1
wretched	1
height	1
to	1
be.'	1
'It	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
height	1
indeed!'	1
said	1
the	1
Caterpillar	1
angrily,	1
rearing	1
itself	1
upright	1
as	1
it	1
spoke	1
(it	1
was	1
exactly	1
three	1
inches	1
high).	1
'But	1
I'm	1
not	1
used	1
to	1
it!'	1
pleaded	1
poor	1
Alice	1
in	1
a	1
piteous	1
tone.	1
And	1
she	1
thought	1
of	1
herself,	1
'I	1
wish	1
the	1
creatures	1
wouldn't	1
be	1
so	1
easily	1
offended!'	1
'You'll	1
get	1
used	1
to	1
it	1
in	1
time,'	1
said	1
the	1
Caterpillar;	1
and	1
it	1
put	1
the	1
hookah	1
into	1
its	1
mouth	1
and	1
began	1
smoking	1
again.	1
This	1
time	1
Alice	1
waited	1
patiently	1
until	1
it	1
chose	1
to	1
speak	1
again.	1
In	1
a	1
minute	1
or	1
two	1
the	1
Caterpillar	1
took	1
the	1
hookah	1
out	1
of	1
its	1
mouth	1
and	1
yawned	1
once	1
or	1
twice,	1
and	1
shook	1
itself.	1
Then	1
it	1
got	1
down	1
off	1
the	1
mushroom,	1
and	1
crawled	1
away	1
in	1
the	1
grass,	1
merely	1
remarking	1
as	1
it	1
went,	1
'One	1
side	1
will	1
make	1
you	1
grow	1
taller,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
will	1
make	1
you	1
grow	1
shorter.'	1
'One	1
side	1
of	1
WHAT?	1
The	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
WHAT?'	1
thought	1
Alice	1
to	1
herself.	1
'Of	1
the	1
mushroom,'	1
said	1
the	1
Caterpillar,	1
just	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
asked	1
it	1
aloud;	1
and	1
in	1
another	1
moment	1
it	1
was	1
out	1
of	1
sight.	1
Alice	1
remained	1
looking	1
thoughtfully	1
at	1
the	1
mushroom	1
for	1
a	1
minute,	1
trying	1
to	1
make	1
out	1
which	1
were	1
the	1
two	1
sides	1
of	1
it;	1
and	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
perfectly	1
round,	1
she	1
found	1
this	1
a	1
very	1
difficult	1
question.	1
However,	1
at	1
last	1
she	1
stretched	1
her	1
arms	1
round	1
it	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
they	1
would	1
go,	1
and	1
broke	1
off	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
the	1
edge	1
with	1
each	1
hand.	1
'And	1
now	1
which	1
is	1
which?'	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself,	1
and	1
nibbled	1
a	1
little	1
of	1
the	1
right-hand	1
bit	1
to	1
try	1
the	1
effect:	1
the	1
next	1
moment	1
she	1
felt	1
a	1
violent	1
blow	1
underneath	1
her	1
chin:	1
it	1
had	1
struck	1
her	1
foot!	1
She	1
was	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
frightened	1
by	1
this	1
very	1
sudden	1
change,	1
but	1
she	1
felt	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
time	1
to	1
be	1
lost,	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
shrinking	1
rapidly;	1
so	1
she	1
set	1
to	1
work	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
eat	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
bit.	1
Her	1
chin	1
was	1
pressed	1
so	1
closely	1
against	1
her	1
foot,	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
hardly	1
room	1
to	1
open	1
her	1
mouth;	1
but	1
she	1
did	1
it	1
at	1
last,	1
and	1
managed	1
to	1
swallow	1
a	1
morsel	1
of	1
the	1
lefthand	1
bit.	1

'Come,	1
my	1
head's	1
free	1
at	1
last!'	1
said	1
Alice	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
of	1
delight,	1
which	1
changed	1
into	1
alarm	1
in	1
another	1
moment,	1
when	1
she	1
found	1
that	1
her	1
shoulders	1
were	1
nowhere	1
to	1
be	1
found:	1
all	1
she	1
could	1
see,	1
when	1
she	1
looked	1
down,	1
was	1
an	1
immense	1
length	1
of	1
neck,	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
rise	1
like	1
a	1
stalk	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
sea	1
of	1
green	1
leaves	1
that	1
lay	1
far	1
below	1
her.	1
'What	1
CAN	1
all	1
that	1
green	1
stuff	1
be?'	1
said	1
Alice.	1
'And	1
where	1
HAVE	1
my	1
shoulders	1
got	1
to?	1
And	1
oh,	1
my	1
poor	1
hands,	1
how	1
is	1
it	1
I	1
can't	1
see	1
you?'	1
She	1
was	1
moving	1
them	1
about	1
as	1
she	1
spoke,	1
but	1
no	1
result	1
seemed	1
to	1
follow,	1
except	1
a	1
little	1
shaking	1
among	1
the	1
distant	1
green	1
leaves.	1
As	1
there	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
no	1
chance	1
of	1
getting	1
her	1
hands	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
head,	1
she	1
tried	1
to	1
get	1
her	1
head	1
down	1
to	1
them,	1
and	1
was	1
delighted	1
to	1
find	1
that	1
her	1
neck	1
would	1
bend	1
about	1
easily	1
in	1
any	1
direction,	1
like	1
a	1
serpent.	1
She	1
had	1
just	1
succeeded	1
in	1
curving	1
it	1
down	1
into	1
a	1
graceful	1
zigzag,	1
and	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
dive	1
in	1
among	1
the	1
leaves,	1
which	1
she	1
found	1
to	1
be	1
nothing	1
but	1
the	1
tops	1
of	1
the	1
trees	1
under	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
wandering,	1
when	1
a	1
sharp	1
hiss	1
made	1
her	1
draw	1
back	1
in	1
a	1
hurry:	1
a	1
large	1
pigeon	1
had	1
flown	1
into	1
her	1
face,	1
and	1
was	1
beating	1
her	1
violently	1
with	1
its	1
wings.	1
'Serpent!'	1
screamed	1
the	1
Pigeon.	1
'I'm	1
NOT	1
a	1
serpent!'	1
said	1
Alice	1
indignantly.	1
'Let	1
me	1
alone!'	1
'Serpent,	1
I	1
say	1
again!'	1
repeated	1
the	1
Pigeon,	1
but	1
in	1
a	1
more	1
subdued	1
tone,	1
and	1
added	1
with	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
sob,	1
'I've	1
tried	1
every	1
way,	1
and	1
nothing	1
seems	1
to	1
suit	1
them!'	1
'I	1
haven't	1
the	1
least	1
idea	1
what	1
you're	1
talking	1
about,'	1
said	1
Alice.	1
'I've	1
tried	1
the	1
roots	1
of	1
trees,	1
and	1
I've	1
tried	1
banks,	1
and	1
I've	1
tried	1
hedges,'	1
the	1
Pigeon	1
went	1
on,	1
without	1
attending	1
to	1
her;	1
'but	1
those	1
serpents!	1
There's	1
no	1
pleasing	1
them!'	1
Alice	1
was	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
puzzled,	1
but	1
she	1
thought	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
use	1
in	1
saying	1
anything	1
more	1
till	1
the	1
Pigeon	1
had	1
finished.	1
'As	1
if	1
it	1
wasn't	1
trouble	1
enough	1
hatching	1
the	1
eggs,'	1
said	1
the	1
Pigeon;	1
'but	1
I	1
must	1
be	1
on	1
the	1
look-out	1
for	1
serpents	1
night	1
and	1
day!	1
Why,	1
I	1
haven't	1
had	1
a	1
wink	1
of	1
sleep	1
these	1
three	1
weeks!'	1
'I'm	1
very	1
sorry	1
you've	1
been	1
annoyed,'	1
said	1
Alice,	1
who	1
was	1
beginning	1
to	1
see	1
its	1
meaning.	1
'And	1
just	1
as	1
I'd	1
taken	1
the	1
highest	1
tree	1
in	1
the	1
wood,'	1
continued	1
the	1
Pigeon,	1
raising	1
its	1
voice	1
to	1
a	1
shriek,	1
'and	1
just	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
thinking	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
free	1
of	1
them	1
at	1
last,	1
they	1
must	1
needs	1
come	1
wriggling	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
sky!	1
Ugh,	1
Serpent!'	1
'But	1
I'm	1
NOT	1
a	1
serpent,	1
I	1
tell	1
you!'	1
said	1
Alice.	1
'I'm	1
a--I'm	1
a--'	1
'Well!	1
WHAT	1
are	1
you?'	1
said	1
the	1
Pigeon.	1
'I	1
can	1
see	1
you're	1
trying	1
to	1
invent	1
something!'	1
'I--I'm	1
a	1
little	1
girl,'	1
said	1
Alice,	1
rather	1
doubtfully,	1
as	1
she	1
remembered	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
changes	1
she	1
had	1
gone	1
through	1
that	1
day.	1
'A	1
likely	1
story	1
indeed!'	1
said	1
the	1
Pigeon	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
of	1
the	1
deepest	1
contempt.	1
'I've	1
seen	1
a	1
good	1
many	1
little	1
girls	1
in	1
my	1
time,	1
but	1
never	1
ONE	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
neck	1
as	1
that!	1
No,	1
no!	1
You're	1
a	1
serpent;	1
and	1
there's	1
no	1
use	1
denying	1
it.	1
I	1
suppose	1
you'll	1
be	1
telling	1
me	1
next	1
that	1
you	1
never	1
tasted	1
an	1
egg!'	1
'I	1
HAVE	1
tasted	1
eggs,	1
certainly,'	1
said	1
Alice,	1
who	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
truthful	1
child;	1
'but	1
little	1
girls	1
eat	1
eggs	1
quite	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
serpents	1
do,	1
you	1
know.'	1
'I	1
don't	1
believe	1
it,'	1
said	1
the	1
Pigeon;	1
'but	1
if	1
they	1
do,	1
why	1
then	1
they're	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
serpent,	1
that's	1
all	1
I	1
can	1
say.'	1
This	1
was	1
such	1
a	1
new	1
idea	1
to	1
Alice,	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
quite	1
silent	1
for	1
a	1
minute	1
or	1
two,	1
which	1
gave	1
the	1
Pigeon	1
the	1
opportunity	1
of	1
adding,	1
'You're	1
looking	1
for	1
eggs,	1
I	1
know	1
THAT	1
well	1
enough;	1
and	1
what	1
does	1
it	1
matter	1
to	1
me	1
whether	1
you're	1
a	1
little	1
girl	1
or	1
a	1
serpent?'	1
'It	1
matters	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
to	1
ME,'	1
said	1
Alice	1
hastily;	1
'but	1
I'm	1
not	1
looking	1
for	1
eggs,	1
as	1
it	1
happens;	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
was,	1
I	1
shouldn't	1
want	1
YOURS:	1
I	1
don't	1
like	1
them	1
raw.'	1
'Well,	1
be	1
off,	1
then!'	1
said	1
the	1
Pigeon	1
in	1
a	1
sulky	1
tone,	1
as	1
it	1
settled	1
down	1
again	1
into	1
its	1
nest.	1
Alice	1
crouched	1
down	1
among	1
the	1
trees	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
she	1
could,	1
for	1
her	1
neck	1
kept	1
getting	1
entangled	1
among	1
the	1
branches,	1
and	1
every	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
she	1
had	1
to	1
stop	1
and	1
untwist	1
it.	1
After	1
a	1
while	1
she	1
remembered	1
that	1
she	1
still	1
held	1
the	1
pieces	1
of	1
mushroom	1
in	1
her	1
hands,	1
and	1
she	1
set	1
to	1
work	1
very	1
carefully,	1
nibbling	1
first	1
at	1
one	1
and	1
then	1
at	1
the	1
other,	1
and	1
growing	1
sometimes	1
taller	1
and	1
sometimes	1
shorter,	1
until	1
she	1
had	1
succeeded	1
in	1
bringing	1
herself	1
down	1
to	1
her	1
usual	1
height.	1
It	1
was	1
so	1
long	1
since	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
anything	1
near	1
the	1
right	1
size,	1
that	1
it	1
felt	1
quite	1
strange	1
at	1
first;	1
but	1
she	1
got	1
used	1
to	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
minutes,	1
and	1
began	1
talking	1
to	1
herself,	1
as	1
usual.	1
'Come,	1
there's	1
half	1
my	1
plan	1
done	1
now!	1
How	1
puzzling	1
all	1
these	1
changes	1
are!	1
I'm	1
never	1
sure	1
what	1
I'm	1
going	1
to	1
be,	1
from	1
one	1
minute	1
to	1
another!	1
However,	1
I've	1
got	1
back	1
to	1
my	1
right	1
size:	1
the	1
next	1
thing	1
is,	1
to	1
get	1
into	1
that	1
beautiful	1
garden--how	1
IS	1
that	1
to	1
be	1
done,	1
I	1
wonder?'	1
As	1
she	1
said	1
this,	1
she	1
came	1
suddenly	1
upon	1
an	1
open	1
place,	1
with	1
a	1
little	1
house	1
in	1
it	1
about	1
four	1
feet	1
high.	1
'Whoever	1
lives	1
there,'	1
thought	1
Alice,	1
'it'll	1
never	1
do	1
to	1
come	1
upon	1
them	1
THIS	1
size:	1
why,	1
I	1
should	1
frighten	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
wits!'	1
So	1
she	1
began	1
nibbling	1
at	1
the	1
righthand	1
bit	1
again,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
venture	1
to	1
go	1
near	1
the	1
house	1
till	1
she	1
had	1
brought	1
herself	1
down	1
to	1
nine	1
inches	1
high.	1
CHAPTER	1
VI.	1
Pig	1
and	1
Pepper	1
For	1
a	1
minute	1
or	1
two	1
she	1
stood	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
wondering	1
what	1
to	1
do	1
next,	1
when	1
suddenly	1
a	1
footman	1
in	1
livery	1
came	1
running	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
wood--(she	1
considered	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
footman	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
livery:	1
otherwise,	1
judging	1
by	1
his	1
face	1
only,	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
called	1
him	1
a	1
fish)--and	1
rapped	1
loudly	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
with	1
his	1
knuckles.	1
It	1
was	1
opened	1
by	1
another	1
footman	1
in	1
livery,	1
with	1
a	1
round	1
face,	1
and	1
large	1
eyes	1
like	1
a	1
frog;	1
and	1
both	1
footmen,	1
Alice	1
noticed,	1
had	1
powdered	1
hair	1
that	1
curled	1
all	1
over	1
their	1
heads.	1
She	1
felt	1
very	1
curious	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
about,	1
and	1
crept	1
a	1
little	1
way	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
wood	1
to	1
listen.	1
The	1
Fish-Footman	1
began	1
by	1
producing	1
from	1
under	1
his	1
arm	1
a	1
great	1
letter,	1
nearly	1
as	1
large	1
as	1
himself,	1
and	1
this	1
he	1
handed	1
over	1
to	1
the	1
other,	1
saying,	1
in	1
a	1
solemn	1
tone,	1
'For	1
the	1
Duchess.	1
An	1
invitation	1
from	1
the	1
Queen	1
to	1
play	1
croquet.'	1
The	1
Frog-Footman	1
repeated,	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
solemn	1
tone,	1
only	1
changing	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
the	1
words	1
a	1
little,	1
'From	1
the	1
Queen.	1
An	1
invitation	1
for	1
the	1
Duchess	1
to	1
play	1
croquet.'	1
Then	1
they	1
both	1
bowed	1
low,	1
and	1
their	1
curls	1
got	1
entangled	1
together.	1
Alice	1
laughed	1
so	1
much	1
at	1
this,	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
to	1
run	1
back	1
into	1
the	1
wood	1
for	1
fear	1
of	1
their	1
hearing	1
her;	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
next	1
peeped	1
out	1
the	1
Fish-Footman	1
was	1
gone,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
was	1
sitting	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
near	1
the	1
door,	1
staring	1
stupidly	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
sky.	1
Alice	1
went	1
timidly	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
knocked.	1
'There's	1
no	1
sort	1
of	1
use	1
in	1
knocking,'	1
said	1
the	1
Footman,	1
'and	1
that	1
for	1
two	1
reasons.	1
First,	1
because	1
I'm	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
door	1
as	1
you	1
are;	1
secondly,	1
because	1
they're	1
making	1
such	1
a	1
noise	1
inside,	1
no	1
one	1
could	1
possibly	1
hear	1
you.'	1
And	1
certainly	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
most	1
extraordinary	1
noise	1
going	1
on	1
within--a	1
constant	1
howling	1
and	1
sneezing,	1
and	1
every	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
a	1
great	1
crash,	1
as	1
if	1
a	1
dish	1
or	1
kettle	1
had	1
been	1
broken	1
to	1
pieces.	1
'Please,	1
then,'	1
said	1
Alice,	1
'how	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
get	1
in?'	1
'There	1
might	1
be	1
some	1
sense	1
in	1
your	1
knocking,'	1
the	1
Footman	1
went	1
on	1
without	1
attending	1
to	1
her,	1
'if	1
we	1
had	1
the	1
door	1
between	1
us.	1
For	1
instance,	1
if	1
you	1
were	1
INSIDE,	1
you	1
might	1
knock,	1
and	1
I	1
could	1
let	1
you	1
out,	1
you	1
know.'	1
He	1
was	1
looking	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
sky	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
he	1
was	1
speaking,	1
and	1
this	1
Alice	1
thought	1
decidedly	1
uncivil.	1
'But	1
perhaps	1
he	1
can't	1
help	1
it,'	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself;	1
'his	1
eyes	1
are	1
so	1
VERY	1
nearly	1
at	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
his	1
head.	1
But	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
he	1
might	1
answer	1
questions.--How	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
get	1
in?'	1
she	1
repeated,	1
aloud.	1
'I	1
shall	1
sit	1
here,'	1
the	1
Footman	1
remarked,	1
'till	1
tomorrow--'	1
At	1
this	1
moment	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
opened,	1
and	1
a	1
large	1
plate	1
came	1
skimming	1
out,	1
straight	1
at	1
the	1
Footman's	1
head:	1
it	1
just	1
grazed	1
his	1
nose,	1
and	1
broke	1
to	1
pieces	1
against	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
trees	1
behind	1
him.	1
'--or	1
next	1
day,	1
maybe,'	1
the	1
Footman	1
continued	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
tone,	1
exactly	1
as	1
if	1
nothing	1
had	1
happened.	1
'How	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
get	1
in?'	1
asked	1
Alice	1
again,	1
in	1
a	1
louder	1
tone.	1
'ARE	1
you	1
to	1
get	1
in	1
at	1
all?'	1
said	1
the	1
Footman.	1
'That's	1
the	1
first	1
question,	1
you	1
know.'	1
It	1
was,	1
no	1
doubt:	1
only	1
Alice	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
to	1
be	1
told	1
so.	1
'It's	1
really	1
dreadful,'	1
she	1
muttered	1
to	1
herself,	1
'the	1
way	1
all	1
the	1
creatures	1
argue.	1
It's	1
enough	1
to	1
drive	1
one	1
crazy!'	1
The	1
Footman	1
seemed	1
to	1
think	1
this	1
a	1
good	1
opportunity	1
for	1
repeating	1
his	1
remark,	1
with	1
variations.	1
'I	1
shall	1
sit	1
here,'	1
he	1
said,	1
'on	1
and	1
off,	1
for	1
days	1
and	1
days.'	1
'But	1
what	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
do?'	1
said	1
Alice.	1
'Anything	1
you	1
like,'	1
said	1
the	1
Footman,	1
and	1
began	1
whistling.	1
'Oh,	1
there's	1
no	1
use	1
in	1
talking	1
to	1
him,'	1
said	1
Alice	1
desperately:	1
'he's	1
perfectly	1
idiotic!'	1
And	1
she	1
opened	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
went	1
in.	1
The	1
door	1
led	1
right	1
into	1
a	1
large	1
kitchen,	1
which	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
smoke	1
from	1
one	1
end	1
to	1
the	1
other:	1
the	1
Duchess	1
was	1
sitting	1
on	1
a	1
three-legged	1
stool	1
in	1
the	1
middle,	1
nursing	1
a	1
baby;	1
the	1
cook	1
was	1
leaning	1
over	1
the	1
fire,	1
stirring	1
a	1
large	1
cauldron	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
full	1
of	1
soup.	1
'There's	1
certainly	1
too	1
much	1
pepper	1
in	1
that	1
soup!'	1
Alice	1
said	1
to	1
herself,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
she	1
could	1
for	1
sneezing.	1
There	1
was	1
certainly	1
too	1
much	1
of	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
air.	1
Even	1
the	1
Duchess	1
sneezed	1
occasionally;	1
and	1
as	1
for	1
the	1
baby,	1
it	1
was	1
sneezing	1
and	1
howling	1
alternately	1
without	1
a	1
moment's	1
pause.	1
The	1
only	1
things	1
in	1
the	1
kitchen	1
that	1
did	1
not	1
sneeze,	1
were	1
the	1
cook,	1
and	1
a	1
large	1
cat	1
which	1
was	1
sitting	1
on	1
the	1
hearth	1
and	1
grinning	1
from	1
ear	1
to	1
ear.	1
'Please	1
would	1
you	1
tell	1
me,'	1
said	1
Alice,	1
a	1
little	1
timidly,	1
for	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
quite	1
sure	1
whether	1
it	1
was	1
good	1
manners	1
for	1
her	1
to	1
speak	1
first,	1
'why	1
your	1
cat	1
grins	1
like	1
that?'	1
'It's	1
a	1
Cheshire	1
cat,'	1
said	1
the	1
Duchess,	1
'and	1
that's	1
why.	1
Pig!'	1
She	1
said	1
the	1
last	1
word	1
with	1
such	1
sudden	1
violence	1
that	1
Alice	1
quite	1
jumped;	1
but	1
she	1
saw	1
in	1
another	1
moment	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
addressed	1
to	1
the	1
baby,	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
her,	1
so	1
she	1
took	1
courage,	1
and	1
went	1
on	1
again:--	1
'I	1
didn't	1
know	1
that	1
Cheshire	1
cats	1
always	1
grinned;	1
in	1
fact,	1
I	1
didn't	1
know	1
that	1
cats	1
COULD	1
grin.'	1
'They	1
all	1
can,'	1
said	1
the	1
Duchess;	1
'and	1
most	1
of	1
'em	1
do.'	1
'I	1
don't	1
know	1
of	1
any	1
that	1
do,'	1
Alice	1
said	1
very	1
politely,	1
feeling	1
quite	1
pleased	1
to	1
have	1
got	1
into	1
a	1
conversation.	1
'You	1
don't	1
know	1
much,'	1
said	1
the	1
Duchess;	1
'and	1
that's	1
a	1
fact.'	1
Alice	1
did	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
like	1
the	1
tone	1
of	1
this	1
remark,	1
and	1
thought	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
as	1
well	1
to	1
introduce	1
some	1
other	1
subject	1
of	1
conversation.	1
While	1
she	1
was	1
trying	1
to	1
fix	1
on	1
one,	1
the	1
cook	1
took	1
the	1
cauldron	1
of	1
soup	1
off	1
the	1
fire,	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
set	1
to	1
work	1
throwing	1
everything	1
within	1
her	1
reach	1
at	1
the	1
Duchess	1
and	1
the	1
baby--the	1
fire-irons	1
came	1
first;	1
then	1
followed	1
a	1
shower	1
of	1
saucepans,	1
plates,	1
and	1
dishes.	1
The	1
Duchess	1
took	1
no	1
notice	1
of	1
them	1
even	1
when	1
they	1
hit	1
her;	1
and	1
the	1
baby	1
was	1
howling	1
so	1
much	1
already,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
quite	1
impossible	1
to	1
say	1
whether	1
the	1
blows	1
hurt	1
it	1
or	1
not.	1
'Oh,	1
PLEASE	1
mind	1
what	1
you're	1
doing!'	1
cried	1
Alice,	1
jumping	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
in	1
an	1
agony	1
of	1
terror.	1
'Oh,	1
there	1
goes	1
his	1
PRECIOUS	1
nose';	1
as	1
an	1
unusually	1
large	1
saucepan	1
flew	1
close	1
by	1
it,	1
and	1
very	1
nearly	1
carried	1
it	1
off.	1
'If	1
everybody	1
minded	1
their	1
own	1
business,'	1
the	1
Duchess	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
hoarse	1
growl,	1
'the	1
world	1
would	1
go	1
round	1
a	1
deal	1
faster	1
than	1
it	1
does.'	1
'Which	1
would	1
NOT	1
be	1
an	1
advantage,'	1
said	1
Alice,	1
who	1
felt	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
get	1
an	1
opportunity	1
of	1
showing	1
off	1
a	1
little	1
of	1
her	1
knowledge.	1
'Just	1
think	1
of	1
what	1
work	1
it	1
would	1
make	1
with	1
the	1
day	1
and	1
night!	1
You	1
see	1
the	1
earth	1
takes	1
twenty-four	1
hours	1
to	1
turn	1
round	1
on	1
its	1
axis--'	1
'Talking	1
of	1
axes,'	1
said	1
the	1
Duchess,	1
'chop	1
off	1
her	1
head!'	1
Alice	1
glanced	1
rather	1
anxiously	1
at	1
the	1
cook,	1
to	1
see	1
if	1
she	1
meant	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
hint;	1
but	1
the	1
cook	1
was	1
busily	1
stirring	1
the	1
soup,	1
and	1
seemed	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
listening,	1
so	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
again:	1
'Twenty-four	1
hours,	1
I	1
THINK;	1
or	1
is	1
it	1
twelve?	1
I--'	1
'Oh,	1
don't	1
bother	1
ME,'	1
said	1
the	1
Duchess;	1
'I	1
never	1
could	1
abide	1
figures!'	1
And	1
with	1
that	1
she	1
began	1
nursing	1
her	1
child	1
again,	1
singing	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
lullaby	1
to	1
it	1
as	1
she	1
did	1
so,	1
and	1
giving	1
it	1
a	1
violent	1
shake	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
every	1
line:	1
'Speak	1
roughly	1
to	1
your	1
little	1
boy,	1
And	1
beat	1
him	1
when	1
he	1
sneezes:	1
He	1
only	1
does	1
it	1
to	1
annoy,	1
Because	1
he	1
knows	1
it	1
teases.'	1
CHORUS.	1
(In	1
which	1
the	1
cook	1
and	1
the	1
baby	1
joined):--	1
'Wow!	1
wow!	1
wow!'	1
While	1
the	1
Duchess	1
sang	1
the	1
second	1
verse	1
of	1
the	1
song,	1
she	1
kept	1
tossing	1
the	1
baby	1
violently	1
up	1
and	1
down,	1
and	1
the	1
poor	1
little	1
thing	1
howled	1
so,	1
that	1
Alice	1
could	1
hardly	1
hear	1
the	1
words:--	1
'I	1
speak	1
severely	1
to	1
my	1
boy,	1
I	1
beat	1
him	1
when	1
he	1
sneezes;	1
For	1
he	1
can	1
thoroughly	1
enjoy	1
The	1
pepper	1
when	1
he	1
pleases!'	1
CHORUS.	1
'Wow!	1
wow!	1
wow!'	1
'Here!	1
you	1
may	1
nurse	1
it	1
a	1
bit,	1
if	1
you	1
like!'	1
the	1
Duchess	1
said	1
to	1
Alice,	1
flinging	1
the	1
baby	1
at	1
her	1
as	1
she	1
spoke.	1
'I	1
must	1
go	1
and	1
get	1
ready	1
to	1
play	1
croquet	1
with	1
the	1
Queen,'	1
and	1
she	1
hurried	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room.	1
The	1
cook	1
threw	1
a	1
frying-pan	1
after	1
her	1
as	1
she	1
went	1
out,	1
but	1
it	1
just	1
missed	1
her.	1
Alice	1
caught	1
the	1
baby	1
with	1
some	1
difficulty,	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
queer-shaped	1
little	1
creature,	1
and	1
held	1
out	1
its	1
arms	1
and	1
legs	1
in	1
all	1
directions,	1
'just	1
like	1
a	1
star-fish,'	1
thought	1
Alice.	1
The	1
poor	1
little	1
thing	1
was	1
snorting	1
like	1
a	1
steam-engine	1
when	1
she	1
caught	1
it,	1
and	1
kept	1
doubling	1
itself	1
up	1
and	1
straightening	1
itself	1
out	1
again,	1
so	1
that	1
altogether,	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
minute	1
or	1
two,	1
it	1
was	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
she	1
could	1
do	1
to	1
hold	1
it.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
made	1
out	1
the	1
proper	1
way	1
of	1
nursing	1
it,	1
(which	1
was	1
to	1
twist	1
it	1
up	1
into	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
knot,	1
and	1
then	1
keep	1
tight	1
hold	1
of	1
its	1
right	1
ear	1
and	1
left	1
foot,	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
prevent	1
its	1
undoing	1
itself,)	1
she	1
carried	1
it	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
open	1
air.	1
'IF	1
I	1
don't	1
take	1
this	1
child	1
away	1
with	1
me,'	1
thought	1
Alice,	1
'they're	1
sure	1
to	1
kill	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
day	1
or	1
two:	1
wouldn't	1
it	1
be	1
murder	1
to	1
leave	1
it	1
behind?'	1
She	1
said	1
the	1
last	1
words	1
out	1
loud,	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
thing	1
grunted	1
in	1
reply	1
(it	1
had	1
left	1
off	1
sneezing	1
by	1
this	1
time).	1
'Don't	1
grunt,'	1
said	1
Alice;	1
'that's	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
a	1
proper	1
way	1
of	1
expressing	1
yourself.'	1
The	1
baby	1
grunted	1
again,	1
and	1
Alice	1
looked	1
very	1
anxiously	1
into	1
its	1
face	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
it.	1
There	1
could	1
be	1
no	1
doubt	1
that	1
it	1
had	1
a	1
VERY	1
turn-up	1
nose,	1
much	1
more	1
like	1
a	1
snout	1
than	1
a	1
real	1
nose;	1
also	1
its	1
eyes	1
were	1
getting	1
extremely	1
small	1
for	1
a	1
baby:	1
altogether	1
Alice	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
the	1
look	1
of	1
the	1
thing	1
at	1
all.	1
'But	1
perhaps	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
sobbing,'	1
she	1
thought,	1
and	1
looked	1
into	1
its	1
eyes	1
again,	1
to	1
see	1
if	1
there	1
were	1
any	1
tears.	1
No,	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
tears.	1
'If	1
you're	1
going	1
to	1
turn	1
into	1
a	1
pig,	1
my	1
dear,'	1
said	1
Alice,	1
seriously,	1
'I'll	1
have	1
nothing	1
more	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
you.	1
Mind	1
now!'	1
The	1
poor	1
little	1
thing	1
sobbed	1
again	1
(or	1
grunted,	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
say	1
which),	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
on	1
for	1
some	1
while	1
in	1
silence.	1
Alice	1
was	1
just	1
beginning	1
to	1
think	1
to	1
herself,	1
'Now,	1
what	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
this	1
creature	1
when	1
I	1
get	1
it	1
home?'	1
when	1
it	1
grunted	1
again,	1
so	1
violently,	1
that	1
she	1
looked	1
down	1
into	1
its	1
face	1
in	1
some	1
alarm.	1
This	1
time	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
NO	1
mistake	1
about	1
it:	1
it	1
was	1
neither	1
more	1
nor	1
less	1
than	1
a	1
pig,	1
and	1
she	1
felt	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
quite	1
absurd	1
for	1
her	1
to	1
carry	1
it	1
further.	1
So	1
she	1
set	1
the	1
little	1
creature	1
down,	1
and	1
felt	1
quite	1
relieved	1
to	1
see	1
it	1
trot	1
away	1
quietly	1
into	1
the	1
wood.	1
'If	1
it	1
had	1
grown	1
up,'	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself,	1
'it	1
would	1
have	1
made	1
a	1
dreadfully	1
ugly	1
child:	1
but	1
it	1
makes	1
rather	1
a	1
handsome	1
pig,	1
I	1
think.'	1
And	1
she	1
began	1
thinking	1
over	1
other	1
children	1
she	1
knew,	1
who	1
might	1
do	1
very	1
well	1
as	1
pigs,	1
and	1
was	1
just	1
saying	1
to	1
herself,	1
'if	1
one	1
only	1
knew	1
the	1
right	1
way	1
to	1
change	1
them--'	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
startled	1
by	1
seeing	1
the	1
Cheshire	1
Cat	1
sitting	1
on	1
a	1
bough	1
of	1
a	1
tree	1
a	1
few	1
yards	1
off.	1
The	1
Cat	1
only	1
grinned	1
when	1
it	1
saw	1
Alice.	1
It	1
looked	1
good-natured,	1
she	1
thought:	1
still	1
it	1
had	1
VERY	1
long	1
claws	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
many	1
teeth,	1
so	1
she	1
felt	1
that	1
it	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
treated	1
with	1
respect.	1
'Cheshire	1
Puss,'	1
she	1
began,	1
rather	1
timidly,	1
as	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
know	1
whether	1
it	1
would	1
like	1
the	1
name:	1
however,	1
it	1
only	1
grinned	1
a	1
little	1
wider.	1
'Come,	1
it's	1
pleased	1
so	1
far,'	1
thought	1
Alice,	1
and	1
she	1
went	1
on.	1
'Would	1
you	1
tell	1
me,	1
please,	1
which	1
way	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
go	1
from	1
here?'	1
'That	1
depends	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
on	1
where	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
get	1
to,'	1
said	1
the	1
Cat.	1
'I	1
don't	1
much	1
care	1
where--'	1
said	1
Alice.	1
'Then	1
it	1
doesn't	1
matter	1
which	1
way	1
you	1
go,'	1
said	1
the	1
Cat.	1
'--so	1
long	1
as	1
I	1
get	1
SOMEWHERE,'	1
Alice	1
added	1
as	1
an	1
explanation.	1
'Oh,	1
you're	1
sure	1
to	1
do	1
that,'	1
said	1
the	1
Cat,	1
'if	1
you	1
only	1
walk	1
long	1
enough.'	1
Alice	1
felt	1
that	1
this	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
denied,	1
so	1
she	1
tried	1
another	1
question.	1
'What	1
sort	1
of	1
people	1
live	1
about	1
here?'	1
'In	1
THAT	1
direction,'	1
the	1
Cat	1
said,	1
waving	1
its	1
right	1
paw	1
round,	1
'lives	1
a	1
Hatter:	1
and	1
in	1
THAT	1
direction,'	1
waving	1
the	1
other	1
paw,	1
'lives	1
a	1
March	1
Hare.	1
Visit	1
either	1
you	1
like:	1
they're	1
both	1
mad.'	1
'But	1
I	1
don't	1
want	1
to	1
go	1
among	1
mad	1
people,'	1
Alice	1
remarked.	1
'Oh,	1
you	1
can't	1
help	1
that,'	1
said	1
the	1
Cat:	1
'we're	1
all	1
mad	1
here.	1
I'm	1
mad.	1
You're	1
mad.'	1
'How	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
I'm	1
mad?'	1
said	1
Alice.	1
'You	1
must	1
be,'	1
said	1
the	1
Cat,	1
'or	1
you	1
wouldn't	1
have	1
come	1
here.'	1
Alice	1
didn't	1
think	1
that	1
proved	1
it	1
at	1
all;	1
however,	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
'And	1
how	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
you're	1
mad?'	1
'To	1
begin	1
with,'	1
said	1
the	1
Cat,	1
'a	1
dog's	1
not	1
mad.	1
You	1
grant	1
that?'	1
'I	1
suppose	1
so,'	1
said	1
Alice.	1
'Well,	1
then,'	1
the	1
Cat	1
went	1
on,	1
'you	1
see,	1
a	1
dog	1
growls	1
when	1
it's	1
angry,	1
and	1
wags	1
its	1
tail	1
when	1
it's	1
pleased.	1
Now	1
I	1
growl	1
when	1
I'm	1
pleased,	1
and	1
wag	1
my	1
tail	1
when	1
I'm	1
angry.	1
Therefore	1
I'm	1
mad.'	1
'I	1
call	1
it	1
purring,	1
not	1
growling,'	1
said	1
Alice.	1
'Call	1
it	1
what	1
you	1
like,'	1
said	1
the	1
Cat.	1
'Do	1
you	1
play	1
croquet	1
with	1
the	1
Queen	1
to-day?'	1
'I	1
should	1
like	1
it	1
very	1
much,'	1
said	1
Alice,	1
'but	1
I	1
haven't	1
been	1
invited	1
yet.'	1
'You'll	1
see	1
me	1
there,'	1
said	1
the	1
Cat,	1
and	1
vanished.	1
Alice	1
was	1
not	1
much	1
surprised	1
at	1
this,	1
she	1
was	1
getting	1
so	1
used	1
to	1
queer	1
things	1
happening.	1
While	1
she	1
was	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
it	1
had	1
been,	1
it	1
suddenly	1
appeared	1
again.	1
'By-the-bye,	1
what	1
became	1
of	1
the	1
baby?'	1
said	1
the	1
Cat.	1
'I'd	1
nearly	1
forgotten	1
to	1
ask.'	1
'It	1
turned	1
into	1
a	1
pig,'	1
Alice	1
quietly	1
said,	1
just	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
come	1
back	1
in	1
a	1
natural	1
way.	1
'I	1
thought	1
it	1
would,'	1
said	1
the	1
Cat,	1
and	1
vanished	1
again.	1
Alice	1
waited	1
a	1
little,	1
half	1
expecting	1
to	1
see	1
it	1
again,	1
but	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
appear,	1
and	1
after	1
a	1
minute	1
or	1
two	1
she	1
walked	1
on	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
March	1
Hare	1
was	1
said	1
to	1
live.	1
'I've	1
seen	1
hatters	1
before,'	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself;	1
'the	1
March	1
Hare	1
will	1
be	1
much	1
the	1
most	1
interesting,	1
and	1
perhaps	1
as	1
this	1
is	1
May	1
it	1
won't	1
be	1
raving	1
mad--at	1
least	1
not	1
so	1
mad	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
March.'	1
As	1
she	1
said	1
this,	1
she	1
looked	1
up,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
the	1
Cat	1
again,	1
sitting	1
on	1
a	1
branch	1
of	1
a	1
tree.	1
'Did	1
you	1
say	1
pig,	1
or	1
fig?'	1
said	1
the	1
Cat.	1
'I	1
said	1
pig,'	1
replied	1
Alice;	1
'and	1
I	1
wish	1
you	1
wouldn't	1
keep	1
appearing	1
and	1
vanishing	1
so	1
suddenly:	1
you	1
make	1
one	1
quite	1
giddy.'	1
'All	1
right,'	1
said	1
the	1
Cat;	1
and	1
this	1
time	1
it	1
vanished	1
quite	1
slowly,	1
beginning	1
with	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
tail,	1
and	1
ending	1
with	1
the	1
grin,	1
which	1
remained	1
some	1
time	1
after	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
it	1
had	1
gone.	1
'Well!	1
I've	1
often	1
seen	1
a	1
cat	1
without	1
a	1
grin,'	1
thought	1
Alice;	1
'but	1
a	1
grin	1
without	1
a	1
cat!	1
It's	1
the	1
most	1
curious	1
thing	1
I	1
ever	1
saw	1
in	1
my	1
life!'	1
She	1
had	1
not	1
gone	1
much	1
farther	1
before	1
she	1
came	1
in	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
March	1
Hare:	1
she	1
thought	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
the	1
right	1
house,	1
because	1
the	1
chimneys	1
were	1
shaped	1
like	1
ears	1
and	1
the	1
roof	1
was	1
thatched	1
with	1
fur.	1
It	1
was	1
so	1
large	1
a	1
house,	1
that	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
to	1
go	1
nearer	1
till	1
she	1
had	1
nibbled	1
some	1
more	1
of	1
the	1
lefthand	1
bit	1
of	1
mushroom,	1
and	1
raised	1
herself	1
to	1
about	1
two	1
feet	1
high:	1
even	1
then	1
she	1
walked	1
up	1
towards	1
it	1
rather	1
timidly,	1
saying	1
to	1
herself	1
'Suppose	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
raving	1
mad	1
after	1
all!	1
I	1
almost	1
wish	1
I'd	1
gone	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
Hatter	1
instead!'	1
CHAPTER	1
VII.	1
A	1
Mad	1
Tea-Party	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
table	1
set	1
out	1
under	1
a	1
tree	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
the	1
March	1
Hare	1
and	1
the	1
Hatter	1
were	1
having	1
tea	1
at	1
it:	1
a	1
Dormouse	1
was	1
sitting	1
between	1
them,	1
fast	1
asleep,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
two	1
were	1
using	1
it	1
as	1
a	1
cushion,	1
resting	1
their	1
elbows	1
on	1
it,	1
and	1
talking	1
over	1
its	1
head.	1
'Very	1
uncomfortable	1
for	1
the	1
Dormouse,'	1
thought	1
Alice;	1
'only,	1
as	1
it's	1
asleep,	1
I	1
suppose	1
it	1
doesn't	1
mind.'	1
The	1
table	1
was	1
a	1
large	1
one,	1
but	1
the	1
three	1
were	1
all	1
crowded	1
together	1
at	1
one	1
corner	1
of	1
it:	1
'No	1
room!	1
No	1
room!'	1
they	1
cried	1
out	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
Alice	1
coming.	1
'There's	1
PLENTY	1
of	1
room!'	1
said	1
Alice	1
indignantly,	1
and	1
she	1
sat	1
down	1
in	1
a	1
large	1
arm-chair	1
at	1
one	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
table.	1
'Have	1
some	1
wine,'	1
the	1
March	1
Hare	1
said	1
in	1
an	1
encouraging	1
tone.	1
Alice	1
looked	1
all	1
round	1
the	1
table,	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
on	1
it	1
but	1
tea.	1
'I	1
don't	1
see	1
any	1
wine,'	1
she	1
remarked.	1
'There	1
isn't	1
any,'	1
said	1
the	1
March	1
Hare.	1
'Then	1
it	1
wasn't	1
very	1
civil	1
of	1
you	1
to	1
offer	1
it,'	1
said	1
Alice	1
angrily.	1
'It	1
wasn't	1
very	1
civil	1
of	1
you	1
to	1
sit	1
down	1
without	1
being	1
invited,'	1
said	1
the	1
March	1
Hare.	1
'I	1
didn't	1
know	1
it	1
was	1
YOUR	1
table,'	1
said	1
Alice;	1
'it's	1
laid	1
for	1
a	1
great	1
many	1
more	1
than	1
three.'	1
'Your	1
hair	1
wants	1
cutting,'	1
said	1
the	1
Hatter.	1
He	1
had	1
been	1
looking	1
at	1
Alice	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
with	1
great	1
curiosity,	1
and	1
this	1
was	1
his	1
first	1
speech.	1
'You	1
should	1
learn	1
not	1
to	1
make	1
personal	1
remarks,'	1
Alice	1
said	1
with	1
some	1
severity;	1
'it's	1
very	1
rude.'	1
The	1
Hatter	1
opened	1
his	1
eyes	1
very	1
wide	1
on	1
hearing	1
this;	1
but	1
all	1
he	1
SAID	1
was,	1
'Why	1
is	1
a	1
raven	1
like	1
a	1
writing-desk?'	1
'Come,	1
we	1
shall	1
have	1
some	1
fun	1
now!'	1
thought	1
Alice.	1
'I'm	1
glad	1
they've	1
begun	1
asking	1
riddles.--I	1
believe	1
I	1
can	1
guess	1
that,'	1
she	1
added	1
aloud.	1
'Do	1
you	1
mean	1
that	1
you	1
think	1
you	1
can	1
find	1
out	1
the	1
answer	1
to	1
it?'	1
said	1
the	1
March	1
Hare.	1
'Exactly	1
so,'	1
said	1
Alice.	1
'Then	1
you	1
should	1
say	1
what	1
you	1
mean,'	1
the	1
March	1
Hare	1
went	1
on.	1
'I	1
do,'	1
Alice	1
hastily	1
replied;	1
'at	1
least--at	1
least	1
I	1
mean	1
what	1
I	1
say--that's	1
the	1
same	1
thing,	1
you	1
know.'	1
'Not	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
a	1
bit!'	1
said	1
the	1
Hatter.	1
'You	1
might	1
just	1
as	1
well	1
say	1
that	1
"I	1
see	1
what	1
I	1
eat"	1
is	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
as	1
"I	1
eat	1
what	1
I	1
see"!'	1
'You	1
might	1
just	1
as	1
well	1
say,'	1
added	1
the	1
March	1
Hare,	1
'that	1
"I	1
like	1
what	1
I	1
get"	1
is	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
as	1
"I	1
get	1
what	1
I	1
like"!'	1
'You	1
might	1
just	1
as	1
well	1
say,'	1
added	1
the	1
Dormouse,	1
who	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
talking	1
in	1
his	1
sleep,	1
'that	1
"I	1
breathe	1
when	1
I	1
sleep"	1
is	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
as	1
"I	1
sleep	1
when	1
I	1
breathe"!'	1
'It	1
IS	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
with	1
you,'	1
said	1
the	1
Hatter,	1
and	1
here	1
the	1
conversation	1
dropped,	1
and	1
the	1
party	1
sat	1
silent	1
for	1
a	1
minute,	1
while	1
Alice	1
thought	1
over	1
all	1
she	1
could	1
remember	1
about	1
ravens	1
and	1
writing-desks,	1
which	1
wasn't	1
much.	1
The	1
Hatter	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
break	1
the	1
silence.	1
'What	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
month	1
is	1
it?'	1
he	1
said,	1
turning	1
to	1
Alice:	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
his	1
watch	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
pocket,	1
and	1
was	1
looking	1
at	1
it	1
uneasily,	1
shaking	1
it	1
every	1
now	1
and	1
then,	1
and	1
holding	1
it	1
to	1
his	1
ear.	1
Alice	1
considered	1
a	1
little,	1
and	1
then	1
said	1
'The	1
fourth.'	1
'Two	1
days	1
wrong!'	1
sighed	1
the	1
Hatter.	1
'I	1
told	1
you	1
butter	1
wouldn't	1
suit	1
the	1
works!'	1
he	1
added	1
looking	1
angrily	1
at	1
the	1
March	1
Hare.	1
'It	1
was	1
the	1
BEST	1
butter,'	1
the	1
March	1
Hare	1
meekly	1
replied.	1
'Yes,	1
but	1
some	1
crumbs	1
must	1
have	1
got	1
in	1
as	1
well,'	1
the	1
Hatter	1
grumbled:	1
'you	1
shouldn't	1
have	1
put	1
it	1
in	1
with	1
the	1
bread-knife.'	1
The	1
March	1
Hare	1
took	1
the	1
watch	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
it	1
gloomily:	1
then	1
he	1
dipped	1
it	1
into	1
his	1
cup	1
of	1
tea,	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
it	1
again:	1
but	1
he	1
could	1
think	1
of	1
nothing	1
better	1
to	1
say	1
than	1
his	1
first	1
remark,	1
'It	1
was	1
the	1
BEST	1
butter,	1
you	1
know.'	1
Alice	1
had	1
been	1
looking	1
over	1
his	1
shoulder	1
with	1
some	1
curiosity.	1
'What	1
a	1
funny	1
watch!'	1
she	1
remarked.	1
'It	1
tells	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
month,	1
and	1
doesn't	1
tell	1
what	1
o'clock	1
it	1
is!'	1
'Why	1
should	1
it?'	1
muttered	1
the	1
Hatter.	1
'Does	1
YOUR	1
watch	1
tell	1
you	1
what	1
year	1
it	1
is?'	1
'Of	1
course	1
not,'	1
Alice	1
replied	1
very	1
readily:	1
'but	1
that's	1
because	1
it	1
stays	1
the	1
same	1
year	1
for	1
such	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
together.'	1
'Which	1
is	1
just	1
the	1
case	1
with	1
MINE,'	1
said	1
the	1
Hatter.	1
Alice	1
felt	1
dreadfully	1
puzzled.	1
The	1
Hatter's	1
remark	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
no	1
sort	1
of	1
meaning	1
in	1
it,	1
and	1
yet	1
it	1
was	1
certainly	1
English.	1
'I	1
don't	1
quite	1
understand	1
you,'	1
she	1
said,	1
as	1
politely	1
as	1
she	1
could.	1
'The	1
Dormouse	1
is	1
asleep	1
again,'	1
said	1
the	1
Hatter,	1
and	1
he	1
poured	1
a	1
little	1
hot	1
tea	1
upon	1
its	1
nose.	1
The	1
Dormouse	1
shook	1
its	1
head	1
impatiently,	1
and	1
said,	1
without	1
opening	1
its	1
eyes,	1
'Of	1
course,	1
of	1
course;	1
just	1
what	1
I	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
remark	1
myself.'	1
'Have	1
you	1
guessed	1
the	1
riddle	1
yet?'	1
the	1
Hatter	1
said,	1
turning	1
to	1
Alice	1
again.	1
'No,	1
I	1
give	1
it	1
up,'	1
Alice	1
replied:	1
'what's	1
the	1
answer?'	1
'I	1
haven't	1
the	1
slightest	1
idea,'	1
said	1
the	1
Hatter.	1
'Nor	1
I,'	1
said	1
the	1
March	1
Hare.	1
Alice	1
sighed	1
wearily.	1
'I	1
think	1
you	1
might	1
do	1
something	1
better	1
with	1
the	1
time,'	1
she	1
said,	1
'than	1
waste	1
it	1
in	1
asking	1
riddles	1
that	1
have	1
no	1
answers.'	1
'If	1
you	1
knew	1
Time	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
I	1
do,'	1
said	1
the	1
Hatter,	1
'you	1
wouldn't	1
talk	1
about	1
wasting	1
IT.	1
It's	1
HIM.'	1
'I	1
don't	1
know	1
what	1
you	1
mean,'	1
said	1
Alice.	1
'Of	1
course	1
you	1
don't!'	1
the	1
Hatter	1
said,	1
tossing	1
his	1
head	1
contemptuously.	1
'I	1
dare	1
say	1
you	1
never	1
even	1
spoke	1
to	1
Time!'	1
'Perhaps	1
not,'	1
Alice	1
cautiously	1
replied:	1
'but	1
I	1
know	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
beat	1
time	1
when	1
I	1
learn	1
music.'	1
'Ah!	1
that	1
accounts	1
for	1
it,'	1
said	1
the	1
Hatter.	1
'He	1
won't	1
stand	1
beating.	1
Now,	1
if	1
you	1
only	1
kept	1
on	1
good	1
terms	1
with	1
him,	1
he'd	1
do	1
almost	1
anything	1
you	1
liked	1
with	1
the	1
clock.	1
For	1
instance,	1
suppose	1
it	1
were	1
nine	1
o'clock	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
just	1
time	1
to	1
begin	1
lessons:	1
you'd	1
only	1
have	1
to	1
whisper	1
a	1
hint	1
to	1
Time,	1
and	1
round	1
goes	1
the	1
clock	1
in	1
a	1
twinkling!	1
Half-past	1
one,	1
time	1
for	1
dinner!'	1
('I	1
only	1
wish	1
it	1
was,'	1
the	1
March	1
Hare	1
said	1
to	1
itself	1
in	1
a	1
whisper.)	1
'That	1
would	1
be	1
grand,	1
certainly,'	1
said	1
Alice	1
thoughtfully:	1
'but	1
then--I	1
shouldn't	1
be	1
hungry	1
for	1
it,	1
you	1
know.'	1
'Not	1
at	1
first,	1
perhaps,'	1
said	1
the	1
Hatter:	1
'but	1
you	1
could	1
keep	1
it	1
to	1
half-past	1
one	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
you	1
liked.'	1
'Is	1
that	1
the	1
way	1
YOU	1
manage?'	1
Alice	1
asked.	1
The	1
Hatter	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
mournfully.	1
'Not	1
I!'	1
he	1
replied.	1
'We	1
quarrelled	1
last	1
March--just	1
before	1
HE	1
went	1
mad,	1
you	1
know--'	1
(pointing	1
with	1
his	1
tea	1
spoon	1
at	1
the	1
March	1
Hare,)	1
'--it	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
great	1
concert	1
given	1
by	1
the	1
Queen	1
of	1
Hearts,	1
and	1
I	1
had	1
to	1
sing	1
"Twinkle,	1
twinkle,	1
little	1
bat!	1
How	1
I	1
wonder	1
what	1
you're	1
at!"	1
You	1
know	1
the	1
song,	1
perhaps?'	1
'I've	1
heard	1
something	1
like	1
it,'	1
said	1
Alice.	1
'It	1
goes	1
on,	1
you	1
know,'	1
the	1
Hatter	1
continued,	1
'in	1
this	1
way:--	1
"Up	1
above	1
the	1
world	1
you	1
fly,	1
Like	1
a	1
tea-tray	1
in	1
the	1
sky.	1
Twinkle,	1
twinkle--"'	1
Here	1
the	1
Dormouse	1
shook	1
itself,	1
and	1
began	1
singing	1
in	1
its	1
sleep	1
'Twinkle,	1
twinkle,	1
twinkle,	1
twinkle--'	1
and	1
went	1
on	1
so	1
long	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
to	1
pinch	1
it	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
stop.	1
'Well,	1
I'd	1
hardly	1
finished	1
the	1
first	1
verse,'	1
said	1
the	1
Hatter,	1
'when	1
the	1
Queen	1
jumped	1
up	1
and	1
bawled	1
out,	1
"He's	1
murdering	1
the	1
time!	1
Off	1
with	1
his	1
head!"'	1
'How	1
dreadfully	1
savage!'	1
exclaimed	1
Alice.	1
'And	1
ever	1
since	1
that,'	1
the	1
Hatter	1
went	1
on	1
in	1
a	1
mournful	1
tone,	1
'he	1
won't	1
do	1
a	1
thing	1
I	1
ask!	1
It's	1
always	1
six	1
o'clock	1
now.'	1
A	1
bright	1
idea	1
came	1
into	1
Alice's	1
head.	1
'Is	1
that	1
the	1
reason	1
so	1
many	1
tea-things	1
are	1
put	1
out	1
here?'	1
she	1
asked.	1
'Yes,	1
that's	1
it,'	1
said	1
the	1
Hatter	1
with	1
a	1
sigh:	1
'it's	1
always	1
tea-time,	1
and	1
we've	1
no	1
time	1
to	1
wash	1
the	1
things	1
between	1
whiles.'	1
'Then	1
you	1
keep	1
moving	1
round,	1
I	1
suppose?'	1
said	1
Alice.	1
'Exactly	1
so,'	1
said	1
the	1
Hatter:	1
'as	1
the	1
things	1
get	1
used	1
up.'	1
'But	1
what	1
happens	1
when	1
you	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
beginning	1
again?'	1
Alice	1
ventured	1
to	1
ask.	1
'Suppose	1
we	1
change	1
the	1
subject,'	1
the	1
March	1
Hare	1
interrupted,	1
yawning.	1
'I'm	1
getting	1
tired	1
of	1
this.	1
I	1
vote	1
the	1
young	1
lady	1
tells	1
us	1
a	1
story.'	1
'I'm	1
afraid	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
one,'	1
said	1
Alice,	1
rather	1
alarmed	1
at	1
the	1
proposal.	1
'Then	1
the	1
Dormouse	1
shall!'	1
they	1
both	1
cried.	1
'Wake	1
up,	1
Dormouse!'	1
And	1
they	1
pinched	1
it	1
on	1
both	1
sides	1
at	1
once.	1
The	1
Dormouse	1
slowly	1
opened	1
his	1
eyes.	1
'I	1
wasn't	1
asleep,'	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
hoarse,	1
feeble	1
voice:	1
'I	1
heard	1
every	1
word	1
you	1
fellows	1
were	1
saying.'	1
'Tell	1
us	1
a	1
story!'	1
said	1
the	1
March	1
Hare.	1
'Yes,	1
please	1
do!'	1
pleaded	1
Alice.	1
'And	1
be	1
quick	1
about	1
it,'	1
added	1
the	1
Hatter,	1
'or	1
you'll	1
be	1
asleep	1
again	1
before	1
it's	1
done.'	1
'Once	1
upon	1
a	1
time	1
there	1
were	1
three	1
little	1
sisters,'	1
the	1
Dormouse	1
began	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
hurry;	1
'and	1
their	1
names	1
were	1
Elsie,	1
Lacie,	1
and	1
Tillie;	1
and	1
they	1
lived	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
a	1
well--'	1
'What	1
did	1
they	1
live	1
on?'	1
said	1
Alice,	1
who	1
always	1
took	1
a	1
great	1
interest	1
in	1
questions	1
of	1
eating	1
and	1
drinking.	1
'They	1
lived	1
on	1
treacle,'	1
said	1
the	1
Dormouse,	1
after	1
thinking	1
a	1
minute	1
or	1
two.	1
'They	1
couldn't	1
have	1
done	1
that,	1
you	1
know,'	1
Alice	1
gently	1
remarked;	1
'they'd	1
have	1
been	1
ill.'	1
'So	1
they	1
were,'	1
said	1
the	1
Dormouse;	1
'VERY	1
ill.'	1
Alice	1
tried	1
to	1
fancy	1
to	1
herself	1
what	1
such	1
an	1
extraordinary	1
ways	1
of	1
living	1
would	1
be	1
like,	1
but	1
it	1
puzzled	1
her	1
too	1
much,	1
so	1
she	1
went	1
on:	1
'But	1
why	1
did	1
they	1
live	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
a	1
well?'	1
'Take	1
some	1
more	1
tea,'	1
the	1
March	1
Hare	1
said	1
to	1
Alice,	1
very	1
earnestly.	1
'I've	1
had	1
nothing	1
yet,'	1
Alice	1
replied	1
in	1
an	1
offended	1
tone,	1
'so	1
I	1
can't	1
take	1
more.'	1
'You	1
mean	1
you	1
can't	1
take	1
LESS,'	1
said	1
the	1
Hatter:	1
'it's	1
very	1
easy	1
to	1
take	1
MORE	1
than	1
nothing.'	1
'Nobody	1
asked	1
YOUR	1
opinion,'	1
said	1
Alice.	1
'Who's	1
making	1
personal	1
remarks	1
now?'	1
the	1
Hatter	1
asked	1
triumphantly.	1
Alice	1
did	1
not	1
quite	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
this:	1
so	1
she	1
helped	1
herself	1
to	1
some	1
tea	1
and	1
bread-and-butter,	1
and	1
then	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
Dormouse,	1
and	1
repeated	1
her	1
question.	1
'Why	1
did	1
they	1
live	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
a	1
well?'	1
The	1
Dormouse	1
again	1
took	1
a	1
minute	1
or	1
two	1
to	1
think	1
about	1
it,	1
and	1
then	1
said,	1
'It	1
was	1
a	1
treacle-well.'	1
'There's	1
no	1
such	1
thing!'	1
Alice	1
was	1
beginning	1
very	1
angrily,	1
but	1
the	1
Hatter	1
and	1
the	1
March	1
Hare	1
went	1
'Sh!	1
sh!'	1
and	1
the	1
Dormouse	1
sulkily	1
remarked,	1
'If	1
you	1
can't	1
be	1
civil,	1
you'd	1
better	1
finish	1
the	1
story	1
for	1
yourself.'	1
'No,	1
please	1
go	1
on!'	1
Alice	1
said	1
very	1
humbly;	1
'I	1
won't	1
interrupt	1
again.	1
I	1
dare	1
say	1
there	1
may	1
be	1
ONE.'	1
'One,	1
indeed!'	1
said	1
the	1
Dormouse	1
indignantly.	1
However,	1
he	1
consented	1
to	1
go	1
on.	1
'And	1
so	1
these	1
three	1
little	1
sisters--they	1
were	1
learning	1
to	1
draw,	1
you	1
know--'	1
'What	1
did	1
they	1
draw?'	1
said	1
Alice,	1
quite	1
forgetting	1
her	1
promise.	1
'Treacle,'	1
said	1
the	1
Dormouse,	1
without	1
considering	1
at	1
all	1
this	1
time.	1
'I	1
want	1
a	1
clean	1
cup,'	1
interrupted	1
the	1
Hatter:	1
'let's	1
all	1
move	1
one	1
place	1
on.'	1
He	1
moved	1
on	1
as	1
he	1
spoke,	1
and	1
the	1
Dormouse	1
followed	1
him:	1
the	1
March	1
Hare	1
moved	1
into	1
the	1
Dormouse's	1
place,	1
and	1
Alice	1
rather	1
unwillingly	1
took	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
March	1
Hare.	1
The	1
Hatter	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
one	1
who	1
got	1
any	1
advantage	1
from	1
the	1
change:	1
and	1
Alice	1
was	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
worse	1
off	1
than	1
before,	1
as	1
the	1
March	1
Hare	1
had	1
just	1
upset	1
the	1
milk-jug	1
into	1
his	1
plate.	1
Alice	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
offend	1
the	1
Dormouse	1
again,	1
so	1
she	1
began	1
very	1
cautiously:	1
'But	1
I	1
don't	1
understand.	1
Where	1
did	1
they	1
draw	1
the	1
treacle	1
from?'	1
'You	1
can	1
draw	1
water	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
water-well,'	1
said	1
the	1
Hatter;	1
'so	1
I	1
should	1
think	1
you	1
could	1
draw	1
treacle	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
treacle-well--eh,	1
stupid?'	1
'But	1
they	1
were	1
IN	1
the	1
well,'	1
Alice	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
Dormouse,	1
not	1
choosing	1
to	1
notice	1
this	1
last	1
remark.	1
'Of	1
course	1
they	1
were',	1
said	1
the	1
Dormouse;	1
'--well	1
in.'	1
This	1
answer	1
so	1
confused	1
poor	1
Alice,	1
that	1
she	1
let	1
the	1
Dormouse	1
go	1
on	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
without	1
interrupting	1
it.	1
'They	1
were	1
learning	1
to	1
draw,'	1
the	1
Dormouse	1
went	1
on,	1
yawning	1
and	1
rubbing	1
its	1
eyes,	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
getting	1
very	1
sleepy;	1
'and	1
they	1
drew	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
things--everything	1
that	1
begins	1
with	1
an	1
M--'	1
'Why	1
with	1
an	1
M?'	1
said	1
Alice.	1
'Why	1
not?'	1
said	1
the	1
March	1
Hare.	1
Alice	1
was	1
silent.	1
The	1
Dormouse	1
had	1
closed	1
its	1
eyes	1
by	1
this	1
time,	1
and	1
was	1
going	1
off	1
into	1
a	1
doze;	1
but,	1
on	1
being	1
pinched	1
by	1
the	1
Hatter,	1
it	1
woke	1
up	1
again	1
with	1
a	1
little	1
shriek,	1
and	1
went	1
on:	1
'--that	1
begins	1
with	1
an	1
M,	1
such	1
as	1
mouse-traps,	1
and	1
the	1
moon,	1
and	1
memory,	1
and	1
muchness--you	1
know	1
you	1
say	1
things	1
are	1
"much	1
of	1
a	1
muchness"--did	1
you	1
ever	1
see	1
such	1
a	1
thing	1
as	1
a	1
drawing	1
of	1
a	1
muchness?'	1
'Really,	1
now	1
you	1
ask	1
me,'	1
said	1
Alice,	1
very	1
much	1
confused,	1
'I	1
don't	1
think--'	1
'Then	1
you	1
shouldn't	1
talk,'	1
said	1
the	1
Hatter.	1
This	1
piece	1
of	1
rudeness	1
was	1
more	1
than	1
Alice	1
could	1
bear:	1
she	1
got	1
up	1
in	1
great	1
disgust,	1
and	1
walked	1
off;	1
the	1
Dormouse	1
fell	1
asleep	1
instantly,	1
and	1
neither	1
of	1
the	1
others	1
took	1
the	1
least	1
notice	1
of	1
her	1
going,	1
though	1
she	1
looked	1
back	1
once	1
or	1
twice,	1
half	1
hoping	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
call	1
after	1
her:	1
the	1
last	1
time	1
she	1
saw	1
them,	1
they	1
were	1
trying	1
to	1
put	1
the	1
Dormouse	1
into	1
the	1
teapot.	1
'At	1
any	1
rate	1
I'll	1
never	1
go	1
THERE	1
again!'	1
said	1
Alice	1
as	1
she	1
picked	1
her	1
way	1
through	1
the	1
wood.	1
'It's	1
the	1
stupidest	1
tea-party	1
I	1
ever	1
was	1
at	1
in	1
all	1
my	1
life!'	1
Just	1
as	1
she	1
said	1
this,	1
she	1
noticed	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
trees	1
had	1
a	1
door	1
leading	1
right	1
into	1
it.	1
'That's	1
very	1
curious!'	1
she	1
thought.	1
'But	1
everything's	1
curious	1
today.	1
I	1
think	1
I	1
may	1
as	1
well	1
go	1
in	1
at	1
once.'	1
And	1
in	1
she	1
went.	1
Once	1
more	1
she	1
found	1
herself	1
in	1
the	1
long	1
hall,	1
and	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
little	1
glass	1
table.	1
'Now,	1
I'll	1
manage	1
better	1
this	1
time,'	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself,	1
and	1
began	1
by	1
taking	1
the	1
little	1
golden	1
key,	1
and	1
unlocking	1
the	1
door	1
that	1
led	1
into	1
the	1
garden.	1
Then	1
she	1
went	1
to	1
work	1
nibbling	1
at	1
the	1
mushroom	1
(she	1
had	1
kept	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
it	1
in	1
her	1
pocket)	1
till	1
she	1
was	1
about	1
a	1
foot	1
high:	1
then	1
she	1
walked	1
down	1
the	1
little	1
passage:	1
and	1
THEN--she	1
found	1
herself	1
at	1
last	1
in	1
the	1
beautiful	1
garden,	1
among	1
the	1
bright	1
flower-beds	1
and	1
the	1
cool	1
fountains.	1
CHAPTER	1
VIII.	1
The	1
Queen's	1
Croquet-Ground	1
A	1
large	1
rose-tree	1
stood	1
near	1
the	1
entrance	1
of	1
the	1
garden:	1
the	1
roses	1
growing	1
on	1
it	1
were	1
white,	1
but	1
there	1
were	1
three	1
gardeners	1
at	1
it,	1
busily	1
painting	1
them	1
red.	1
Alice	1
thought	1
this	1
a	1
very	1
curious	1
thing,	1
and	1
she	1
went	1
nearer	1
to	1
watch	1
them,	1
and	1
just	1
as	1
she	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
them	1
she	1
heard	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
say,	1
'Look	1
out	1
now,	1
Five!	1
Don't	1
go	1
splashing	1
paint	1
over	1
me	1
like	1
that!'	1
'I	1
couldn't	1
help	1
it,'	1
said	1
Five,	1
in	1
a	1
sulky	1
tone;	1
'Seven	1
jogged	1
my	1
elbow.'	1
On	1
which	1
Seven	1
looked	1
up	1
and	1
said,	1
'That's	1
right,	1
Five!	1
Always	1
lay	1
the	1
blame	1
on	1
others!'	1
'YOU'D	1
better	1
not	1
talk!'	1
said	1
Five.	1
'I	1
heard	1
the	1
Queen	1
say	1
only	1
yesterday	1
you	1
deserved	1
to	1
be	1
beheaded!'	1
'What	1
for?'	1
said	1
the	1
one	1
who	1
had	1
spoken	1
first.	1
'That's	1
none	1
of	1
YOUR	1
business,	1
Two!'	1
said	1
Seven.	1
'Yes,	1
it	1
IS	1
his	1
business!'	1
said	1
Five,	1
'and	1
I'll	1
tell	1
him--it	1
was	1
for	1
bringing	1
the	1
cook	1
tulip-roots	1
instead	1
of	1
onions.'	1
Seven	1
flung	1
down	1
his	1
brush,	1
and	1
had	1
just	1
begun	1
'Well,	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
unjust	1
things--'	1
when	1
his	1
eye	1
chanced	1
to	1
fall	1
upon	1
Alice,	1
as	1
she	1
stood	1
watching	1
them,	1
and	1
he	1
checked	1
himself	1
suddenly:	1
the	1
others	1
looked	1
round	1
also,	1
and	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
bowed	1
low.	1
'Would	1
you	1
tell	1
me,'	1
said	1
Alice,	1
a	1
little	1
timidly,	1
'why	1
you	1
are	1
painting	1
those	1
roses?'	1
Five	1
and	1
Seven	1
said	1
nothing,	1
but	1
looked	1
at	1
Two.	1
Two	1
began	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice,	1
'Why	1
the	1
fact	1
is,	1
you	1
see,	1
Miss,	1
this	1
here	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
RED	1
rose-tree,	1
and	1
we	1
put	1
a	1
white	1
one	1
in	1
by	1
mistake;	1
and	1
if	1
the	1
Queen	1
was	1
to	1
find	1
it	1
out,	1
we	1
should	1
all	1
have	1
our	1
heads	1
cut	1
off,	1
you	1
know.	1
So	1
you	1
see,	1
Miss,	1
we're	1
doing	1
our	1
best,	1
afore	1
she	1
comes,	1
to--'	1
At	1
this	1
moment	1
Five,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
anxiously	1
looking	1
across	1
the	1
garden,	1
called	1
out	1
'The	1
Queen!	1
The	1
Queen!'	1
and	1
the	1
three	1
gardeners	1
instantly	1
threw	1
themselves	1
flat	1
upon	1
their	1
faces.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
sound	1
of	1
many	1
footsteps,	1
and	1
Alice	1
looked	1
round,	1
eager	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
Queen.	1
First	1
came	1
ten	1
soldiers	1
carrying	1
clubs;	1
these	1
were	1
all	1
shaped	1
like	1
the	1
three	1
gardeners,	1
oblong	1
and	1
flat,	1
with	1
their	1
hands	1
and	1
feet	1
at	1
the	1
corners:	1
next	1
the	1
ten	1
courtiers;	1
these	1
were	1
ornamented	1
all	1
over	1
with	1
diamonds,	1
and	1
walked	1
two	1
and	1
two,	1
as	1
the	1
soldiers	1
did.	1
After	1
these	1
came	1
the	1
royal	1
children;	1
there	1
were	1
ten	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
dears	1
came	1
jumping	1
merrily	1
along	1
hand	1
in	1
hand,	1
in	1
couples:	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
ornamented	1
with	1
hearts.	1
Next	1
came	1
the	1
guests,	1
mostly	1
Kings	1
and	1
Queens,	1
and	1
among	1
them	1
Alice	1
recognised	1
the	1
White	1
Rabbit:	1
it	1
was	1
talking	1
in	1
a	1
hurried	1
nervous	1
manner,	1
smiling	1
at	1
everything	1
that	1
was	1
said,	1
and	1
went	1
by	1
without	1
noticing	1
her.	1
Then	1
followed	1
the	1
Knave	1
of	1
Hearts,	1
carrying	1
the	1
King's	1
crown	1
on	1
a	1
crimson	1
velvet	1
cushion;	1
and,	1
last	1
of	1
all	1
this	1
grand	1
procession,	1
came	1
THE	1
KING	1
AND	1
QUEEN	1
OF	1
HEARTS.	1
Alice	1
was	1
rather	1
doubtful	1
whether	1
she	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
lie	1
down	1
on	1
her	1
face	1
like	1
the	1
three	1
gardeners,	1
but	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
remember	1
ever	1
having	1
heard	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
rule	1
at	1
processions;	1
'and	1
besides,	1
what	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
a	1
procession,'	1
thought	1
she,	1
'if	1
people	1
had	1
all	1
to	1
lie	1
down	1
upon	1
their	1
faces,	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
couldn't	1
see	1
it?'	1
So	1
she	1
stood	1
still	1
where	1
she	1
was,	1
and	1
waited.	1
When	1
the	1
procession	1
came	1
opposite	1
to	1
Alice,	1
they	1
all	1
stopped	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
her,	1
and	1
the	1
Queen	1
said	1
severely	1
'Who	1
is	1
this?'	1
She	1
said	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
Knave	1
of	1
Hearts,	1
who	1
only	1
bowed	1
and	1
smiled	1
in	1
reply.	1
'Idiot!'	1
said	1
the	1
Queen,	1
tossing	1
her	1
head	1
impatiently;	1
and,	1
turning	1
to	1
Alice,	1
she	1
went	1
on,	1
'What's	1
your	1
name,	1
child?'	1
'My	1
name	1
is	1
Alice,	1
so	1
please	1
your	1
Majesty,'	1
said	1
Alice	1
very	1
politely;	1
but	1
she	1
added,	1
to	1
herself,	1
'Why,	1
they're	1
only	1
a	1
pack	1
of	1
cards,	1
after	1
all.	1
I	1
needn't	1
be	1
afraid	1
of	1
them!'	1
'And	1
who	1
are	1
THESE?'	1
said	1
the	1
Queen,	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
three	1
gardeners	1
who	1
were	1
lying	1
round	1
the	1
rosetree;	1
for,	1
you	1
see,	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
lying	1
on	1
their	1
faces,	1
and	1
the	1
pattern	1
on	1
their	1
backs	1
was	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
pack,	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
tell	1
whether	1
they	1
were	1
gardeners,	1
or	1
soldiers,	1
or	1
courtiers,	1
or	1
three	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
children.	1
'How	1
should	1
I	1
know?'	1
said	1
Alice,	1
surprised	1
at	1
her	1
own	1
courage.	1
'It's	1
no	1
business	1
of	1
MINE.'	1
The	1
Queen	1
turned	1
crimson	1
with	1
fury,	1
and,	1
after	1
glaring	1
at	1
her	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
like	1
a	1
wild	1
beast,	1
screamed	1
'Off	1
with	1
her	1
head!	1
Off--'	1
'Nonsense!'	1
said	1
Alice,	1
very	1
loudly	1
and	1
decidedly,	1
and	1
the	1
Queen	1
was	1
silent.	1
The	1
King	1
laid	1
his	1
hand	1
upon	1
her	1
arm,	1
and	1
timidly	1
said	1
'Consider,	1
my	1
dear:	1
she	1
is	1
only	1
a	1
child!'	1
The	1
Queen	1
turned	1
angrily	1
away	1
from	1
him,	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
Knave	1
'Turn	1
them	1
over!'	1
The	1
Knave	1
did	1
so,	1
very	1
carefully,	1
with	1
one	1
foot.	1
'Get	1
up!'	1
said	1
the	1
Queen,	1
in	1
a	1
shrill,	1
loud	1
voice,	1
and	1
the	1
three	1
gardeners	1
instantly	1
jumped	1
up,	1
and	1
began	1
bowing	1
to	1
the	1
King,	1
the	1
Queen,	1
the	1
royal	1
children,	1
and	1
everybody	1
else.	1
'Leave	1
off	1
that!'	1
screamed	1
the	1
Queen.	1
'You	1
make	1
me	1
giddy.'	1
And	1
then,	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
rose-tree,	1
she	1
went	1
on,	1
'What	1
HAVE	1
you	1
been	1
doing	1
here?'	1
'May	1
it	1
please	1
your	1
Majesty,'	1
said	1
Two,	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
humble	1
tone,	1
going	1
down	1
on	1
one	1
knee	1
as	1
he	1
spoke,	1
'we	1
were	1
trying--'	1
'I	1
see!'	1
said	1
the	1
Queen,	1
who	1
had	1
meanwhile	1
been	1
examining	1
the	1
roses.	1
'Off	1
with	1
their	1
heads!'	1
and	1
the	1
procession	1
moved	1
on,	1
three	1
of	1
the	1
soldiers	1
remaining	1
behind	1
to	1
execute	1
the	1
unfortunate	1
gardeners,	1
who	1
ran	1
to	1
Alice	1
for	1
protection.	1
'You	1
shan't	1
be	1
beheaded!'	1
said	1
Alice,	1
and	1
she	1
put	1
them	1
into	1
a	1
large	1
flower-pot	1
that	1
stood	1
near.	1
The	1
three	1
soldiers	1
wandered	1
about	1
for	1
a	1
minute	1
or	1
two,	1
looking	1
for	1
them,	1
and	1
then	1
quietly	1
marched	1
off	1
after	1
the	1
others.	1
'Are	1
their	1
heads	1
off?'	1
shouted	1
the	1
Queen.	1
'Their	1
heads	1
are	1
gone,	1
if	1
it	1
please	1
your	1
Majesty!'	1
the	1
soldiers	1
shouted	1
in	1
reply.	1
'That's	1
right!'	1
shouted	1
the	1
Queen.	1
'Can	1
you	1
play	1
croquet?'	1
The	1
soldiers	1
were	1
silent,	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
Alice,	1
as	1
the	1
question	1
was	1
evidently	1
meant	1
for	1
her.	1
'Yes!'	1
shouted	1
Alice.	1
'Come	1
on,	1
then!'	1
roared	1
the	1
Queen,	1
and	1
Alice	1
joined	1
the	1
procession,	1
wondering	1
very	1
much	1
what	1
would	1
happen	1
next.	1
'It's--it's	1
a	1
very	1
fine	1
day!'	1
said	1
a	1
timid	1
voice	1
at	1
her	1
side.	1
She	1
was	1
walking	1
by	1
the	1
White	1
Rabbit,	1
who	1
was	1
peeping	1
anxiously	1
into	1
her	1
face.	1
'Very,'	1
said	1
Alice:	1
'--where's	1
the	1
Duchess?'	1
'Hush!	1
Hush!'	1
said	1
the	1
Rabbit	1
in	1
a	1
low,	1
hurried	1
tone.	1
He	1
looked	1
anxiously	1
over	1
his	1
shoulder	1
as	1
he	1
spoke,	1
and	1
then	1
raised	1
himself	1
upon	1
tiptoe,	1
put	1
his	1
mouth	1
close	1
to	1
her	1
ear,	1
and	1
whispered	1
'She's	1
under	1
sentence	1
of	1
execution.'	1
'What	1
for?'	1
said	1
Alice.	1
'Did	1
you	1
say	1
"What	1
a	1
pity!"?'	1
the	1
Rabbit	1
asked.	1
'No,	1
I	1
didn't,'	1
said	1
Alice:	1
'I	1
don't	1
think	1
it's	1
at	1
all	1
a	1
pity.	1
I	1
said	1
"What	1
for?"'	1
'She	1
boxed	1
the	1
Queen's	1
ears--'	1
the	1
Rabbit	1
began.	1
Alice	1
gave	1
a	1
little	1
scream	1
of	1
laughter.	1
'Oh,	1
hush!'	1
the	1
Rabbit	1
whispered	1
in	1
a	1
frightened	1
tone.	1
'The	1
Queen	1
will	1
hear	1
you!	1
You	1
see,	1
she	1
came	1
rather	1
late,	1
and	1
the	1
Queen	1
said--'	1
'Get	1
to	1
your	1
places!'	1
shouted	1
the	1
Queen	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
of	1
thunder,	1
and	1
people	1
began	1
running	1
about	1
in	1
all	1
directions,	1
tumbling	1
up	1
against	1
each	1
other;	1
however,	1
they	1
got	1
settled	1
down	1
in	1
a	1
minute	1
or	1
two,	1
and	1
the	1
game	1
began.	1
Alice	1
thought	1
she	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
such	1
a	1
curious	1
croquet-ground	1
in	1
her	1
life;	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
ridges	1
and	1
furrows;	1
the	1
balls	1
were	1
live	1
hedgehogs,	1
the	1
mallets	1
live	1
flamingoes,	1
and	1
the	1
soldiers	1
had	1
to	1
double	1
themselves	1
up	1
and	1
to	1
stand	1
on	1
their	1
hands	1
and	1
feet,	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
arches.	1
The	1
chief	1
difficulty	1
Alice	1
found	1
at	1
first	1
was	1
in	1
managing	1
her	1
flamingo:	1
she	1
succeeded	1
in	1
getting	1
its	1
body	1
tucked	1
away,	1
comfortably	1
enough,	1
under	1
her	1
arm,	1
with	1
its	1
legs	1
hanging	1
down,	1
but	1
generally,	1
just	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
got	1
its	1
neck	1
nicely	1
straightened	1
out,	1
and	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
hedgehog	1
a	1
blow	1
with	1
its	1
head,	1
it	1
WOULD	1
twist	1
itself	1
round	1
and	1
look	1
up	1
in	1
her	1
face,	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
puzzled	1
expression	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
bursting	1
out	1
laughing:	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
got	1
its	1
head	1
down,	1
and	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
begin	1
again,	1
it	1
was	1
very	1
provoking	1
to	1
find	1
that	1
the	1
hedgehog	1
had	1
unrolled	1
itself,	1
and	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
act	1
of	1
crawling	1
away:	1
besides	1
all	1
this,	1
there	1
was	1
generally	1
a	1
ridge	1
or	1
furrow	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
wherever	1
she	1
wanted	1
to	1
send	1
the	1
hedgehog	1
to,	1
and,	1
as	1
the	1
doubled-up	1
soldiers	1
were	1
always	1
getting	1
up	1
and	1
walking	1
off	1
to	1
other	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
ground,	1
Alice	1
soon	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
conclusion	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
difficult	1
game	1
indeed.	1
The	1
players	1
all	1
played	1
at	1
once	1
without	1
waiting	1
for	1
turns,	1
quarrelling	1
all	1
the	1
while,	1
and	1
fighting	1
for	1
the	1
hedgehogs;	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
short	1
time	1
the	1
Queen	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
furious	1
passion,	1
and	1
went	1
stamping	1
about,	1
and	1
shouting	1
'Off	1
with	1
his	1
head!'	1
or	1
'Off	1
with	1
her	1
head!'	1
about	1
once	1
in	1
a	1
minute.	1
Alice	1
began	1
to	1
feel	1
very	1
uneasy:	1
to	1
be	1
sure,	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
as	1
yet	1
had	1
any	1
dispute	1
with	1
the	1
Queen,	1
but	1
she	1
knew	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
happen	1
any	1
minute,	1
'and	1
then,'	1
thought	1
she,	1
'what	1
would	1
become	1
of	1
me?	1
They're	1
dreadfully	1
fond	1
of	1
beheading	1
people	1
here;	1
the	1
great	1
wonder	1
is,	1
that	1
there's	1
any	1
one	1
left	1
alive!'	1
She	1
was	1
looking	1
about	1
for	1
some	1
way	1
of	1
escape,	1
and	1
wondering	1
whether	1
she	1
could	1
get	1
away	1
without	1
being	1
seen,	1
when	1
she	1
noticed	1
a	1
curious	1
appearance	1
in	1
the	1
air:	1
it	1
puzzled	1
her	1
very	1
much	1
at	1
first,	1
but,	1
after	1
watching	1
it	1
a	1
minute	1
or	1
two,	1
she	1
made	1
it	1
out	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
grin,	1
and	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself	1
'It's	1
the	1
Cheshire	1
Cat:	1
now	1
I	1
shall	1
have	1
somebody	1
to	1
talk	1
to.'	1
'How	1
are	1
you	1
getting	1
on?'	1
said	1
the	1
Cat,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
there	1
was	1
mouth	1
enough	1
for	1
it	1
to	1
speak	1
with.	1
Alice	1
waited	1
till	1
the	1
eyes	1
appeared,	1
and	1
then	1
nodded.	1
'It's	1
no	1
use	1
speaking	1
to	1
it,'	1
she	1
thought,	1
'till	1
its	1
ears	1
have	1
come,	1
or	1
at	1
least	1
one	1
of	1
them.'	1
In	1
another	1
minute	1
the	1
whole	1
head	1
appeared,	1
and	1
then	1
Alice	1
put	1
down	1
her	1
flamingo,	1
and	1
began	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
game,	1
feeling	1
very	1
glad	1
she	1
had	1
someone	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
her.	1
The	1
Cat	1
seemed	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
enough	1
of	1
it	1
now	1
in	1
sight,	1
and	1
no	1
more	1
of	1
it	1
appeared.	1
'I	1
don't	1
think	1
they	1
play	1
at	1
all	1
fairly,'	1
Alice	1
began,	1
in	1
rather	1
a	1
complaining	1
tone,	1
'and	1
they	1
all	1
quarrel	1
so	1
dreadfully	1
one	1
can't	1
hear	1
oneself	1
speak--and	1
they	1
don't	1
seem	1
to	1
have	1
any	1
rules	1
in	1
particular;	1
at	1
least,	1
if	1
there	1
are,	1
nobody	1
attends	1
to	1
them--and	1
you've	1
no	1
idea	1
how	1
confusing	1
it	1
is	1
all	1
the	1
things	1
being	1
alive;	1
for	1
instance,	1
there's	1
the	1
arch	1
I've	1
got	1
to	1
go	1
through	1
next	1
walking	1
about	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
ground--and	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
croqueted	1
the	1
Queen's	1
hedgehog	1
just	1
now,	1
only	1
it	1
ran	1
away	1
when	1
it	1
saw	1
mine	1
coming!'	1
'How	1
do	1
you	1
like	1
the	1
Queen?'	1
said	1
the	1
Cat	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice.	1
'Not	1
at	1
all,'	1
said	1
Alice:	1
'she's	1
so	1
extremely--'	1
Just	1
then	1
she	1
noticed	1
that	1
the	1
Queen	1
was	1
close	1
behind	1
her,	1
listening:	1
so	1
she	1
went	1
on,	1
'--likely	1
to	1
win,	1
that	1
it's	1
hardly	1
worth	1
while	1
finishing	1
the	1
game.'	1
The	1
Queen	1
smiled	1
and	1
passed	1
on.	1
'Who	1
ARE	1
you	1
talking	1
to?'	1
said	1
the	1
King,	1
going	1
up	1
to	1
Alice,	1
and	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
Cat's	1
head	1
with	1
great	1
curiosity.	1
'It's	1
a	1
friend	1
of	1
mine--a	1
Cheshire	1
Cat,'	1
said	1
Alice:	1
'allow	1
me	1
to	1
introduce	1
it.'	1
'I	1
don't	1
like	1
the	1
look	1
of	1
it	1
at	1
all,'	1
said	1
the	1
King:	1
'however,	1
it	1
may	1
kiss	1
my	1
hand	1
if	1
it	1
likes.'	1
'I'd	1
rather	1
not,'	1
the	1
Cat	1
remarked.	1
'Don't	1
be	1
impertinent,'	1
said	1
the	1
King,	1
'and	1
don't	1
look	1
at	1
me	1
like	1
that!'	1
He	1
got	1
behind	1
Alice	1
as	1
he	1
spoke.	1
'A	1
cat	1
may	1
look	1
at	1
a	1
king,'	1
said	1
Alice.	1
'I've	1
read	1
that	1
in	1
some	1
book,	1
but	1
I	1
don't	1
remember	1
where.'	1
'Well,	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
removed,'	1
said	1
the	1
King	1
very	1
decidedly,	1
and	1
he	1
called	1
the	1
Queen,	1
who	1
was	1
passing	1
at	1
the	1
moment,	1
'My	1
dear!	1
I	1
wish	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
this	1
cat	1
removed!'	1
The	1
Queen	1
had	1
only	1
one	1
way	1
of	1
settling	1
all	1
difficulties,	1
great	1
or	1
small.	1
'Off	1
with	1
his	1
head!'	1
she	1
said,	1
without	1
even	1
looking	1
round.	1
'I'll	1
fetch	1
the	1
executioner	1
myself,'	1
said	1
the	1
King	1
eagerly,	1
and	1
he	1
hurried	1
off.	1
Alice	1
thought	1
she	1
might	1
as	1
well	1
go	1
back,	1
and	1
see	1
how	1
the	1
game	1
was	1
going	1
on,	1
as	1
she	1
heard	1
the	1
Queen's	1
voice	1
in	1
the	1
distance,	1
screaming	1
with	1
passion.	1
She	1
had	1
already	1
heard	1
her	1
sentence	1
three	1
of	1
the	1
players	1
to	1
be	1
executed	1
for	1
having	1
missed	1
their	1
turns,	1
and	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
the	1
look	1
of	1
things	1
at	1
all,	1
as	1
the	1
game	1
was	1
in	1
such	1
confusion	1
that	1
she	1
never	1
knew	1
whether	1
it	1
was	1
her	1
turn	1
or	1
not.	1
So	1
she	1
went	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
her	1
hedgehog.	1
The	1
hedgehog	1
was	1
engaged	1
in	1
a	1
fight	1
with	1
another	1
hedgehog,	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
Alice	1
an	1
excellent	1
opportunity	1
for	1
croqueting	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
other:	1
the	1
only	1
difficulty	1
was,	1
that	1
her	1
flamingo	1
was	1
gone	1
across	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
garden,	1
where	1
Alice	1
could	1
see	1
it	1
trying	1
in	1
a	1
helpless	1
sort	1
of	1
way	1
to	1
fly	1
up	1
into	1
a	1
tree.	1
By	1
the	1
time	1
she	1
had	1
caught	1
the	1
flamingo	1
and	1
brought	1
it	1
back,	1
the	1
fight	1
was	1
over,	1
and	1
both	1
the	1
hedgehogs	1
were	1
out	1
of	1
sight:	1
'but	1
it	1
doesn't	1
matter	1
much,'	1
thought	1
Alice,	1
'as	1
all	1
the	1
arches	1
are	1
gone	1
from	1
this	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
ground.'	1
So	1
she	1
tucked	1
it	1
away	1
under	1
her	1
arm,	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
not	1
escape	1
again,	1
and	1
went	1
back	1
for	1
a	1
little	1
more	1
conversation	1
with	1
her	1
friend.	1
When	1
she	1
got	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
Cheshire	1
Cat,	1
she	1
was	1
surprised	1
to	1
find	1
quite	1
a	1
large	1
crowd	1
collected	1
round	1
it:	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
dispute	1
going	1
on	1
between	1
the	1
executioner,	1
the	1
King,	1
and	1
the	1
Queen,	1
who	1
were	1
all	1
talking	1
at	1
once,	1
while	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
were	1
quite	1
silent,	1
and	1
looked	1
very	1
uncomfortable.	1
The	1
moment	1
Alice	1
appeared,	1
she	1
was	1
appealed	1
to	1
by	1
all	1
three	1
to	1
settle	1
the	1
question,	1
and	1
they	1
repeated	1
their	1
arguments	1
to	1
her,	1
though,	1
as	1
they	1
all	1
spoke	1
at	1
once,	1
she	1
found	1
it	1
very	1
hard	1
indeed	1
to	1
make	1
out	1
exactly	1
what	1
they	1
said.	1
The	1
executioner's	1
argument	1
was,	1
that	1
you	1
couldn't	1
cut	1
off	1
a	1
head	1
unless	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
body	1
to	1
cut	1
it	1
off	1
from:	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
had	1
to	1
do	1
such	1
a	1
thing	1
before,	1
and	1
he	1
wasn't	1
going	1
to	1
begin	1
at	1
HIS	1
time	1
of	1
life.	1
The	1
King's	1
argument	1
was,	1
that	1
anything	1
that	1
had	1
a	1
head	1
could	1
be	1
beheaded,	1
and	1
that	1
you	1
weren't	1
to	1
talk	1
nonsense.	1
The	1
Queen's	1
argument	1
was,	1
that	1
if	1
something	1
wasn't	1
done	1
about	1
it	1
in	1
less	1
than	1
no	1
time	1
she'd	1
have	1
everybody	1
executed,	1
all	1
round.	1
(It	1
was	1
this	1
last	1
remark	1
that	1
had	1
made	1
the	1
whole	1
party	1
look	1
so	1
grave	1
and	1
anxious.)	1
Alice	1
could	1
think	1
of	1
nothing	1
else	1
to	1
say	1
but	1
'It	1
belongs	1
to	1
the	1
Duchess:	1
you'd	1
better	1
ask	1
HER	1
about	1
it.'	1
'She's	1
in	1
prison,'	1
the	1
Queen	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
executioner:	1
'fetch	1
her	1
here.'	1
And	1
the	1
executioner	1
went	1
off	1
like	1
an	1
arrow.	1
The	1
Cat's	1
head	1
began	1
fading	1
away	1
the	1
moment	1
he	1
was	1
gone,	1
and,	1
by	1
the	1
time	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
back	1
with	1
the	1
Duchess,	1
it	1
had	1
entirely	1
disappeared;	1
so	1
the	1
King	1
and	1
the	1
executioner	1
ran	1
wildly	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
looking	1
for	1
it,	1
while	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
party	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
game.	1
CHAPTER	1
IX.	1
The	1
Mock	1
Turtle's	1
Story	1
'You	1
can't	1
think	1
how	1
glad	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
again,	1
you	1
dear	1
old	1
thing!'	1
said	1
the	1
Duchess,	1
as	1
she	1
tucked	1
her	1
arm	1
affectionately	1
into	1
Alice's,	1
and	1
they	1
walked	1
off	1
together.	1
Alice	1
was	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
find	1
her	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
pleasant	1
temper,	1
and	1
thought	1
to	1
herself	1
that	1
perhaps	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
the	1
pepper	1
that	1
had	1
made	1
her	1
so	1
savage	1
when	1
they	1
met	1
in	1
the	1
kitchen.	1
'When	1
I'M	1
a	1
Duchess,'	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself,	1
(not	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
hopeful	1
tone	1
though),	1
'I	1
won't	1
have	1
any	1
pepper	1
in	1
my	1
kitchen	1
AT	1
ALL.	1
Soup	1
does	1
very	1
well	1
without--Maybe	1
it's	1
always	1
pepper	1
that	1
makes	1
people	1
hot-tempered,'	1
she	1
went	1
on,	1
very	1
much	1
pleased	1
at	1
having	1
found	1
out	1
a	1
new	1
kind	1
of	1
rule,	1
'and	1
vinegar	1
that	1
makes	1
them	1
sour--and	1
camomile	1
that	1
makes	1
them	1
bitter--and--and	1
barley-sugar	1
and	1
such	1
things	1
that	1
make	1
children	1
sweet-tempered.	1
I	1
only	1
wish	1
people	1
knew	1
that:	1
then	1
they	1
wouldn't	1
be	1
so	1
stingy	1
about	1
it,	1
you	1
know--'	1
She	1
had	1
quite	1
forgotten	1
the	1
Duchess	1
by	1
this	1
time,	1
and	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
startled	1
when	1
she	1
heard	1
her	1
voice	1
close	1
to	1
her	1
ear.	1
'You're	1
thinking	1
about	1
something,	1
my	1
dear,	1
and	1
that	1
makes	1
you	1
forget	1
to	1
talk.	1
I	1
can't	1
tell	1
you	1
just	1
now	1
what	1
the	1
moral	1
of	1
that	1
is,	1
but	1
I	1
shall	1
remember	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
bit.'	1
'Perhaps	1
it	1
hasn't	1
one,'	1
Alice	1
ventured	1
to	1
remark.	1
'Tut,	1
tut,	1
child!'	1
said	1
the	1
Duchess.	1
'Everything's	1
got	1
a	1
moral,	1
if	1
only	1
you	1
can	1
find	1
it.'	1
And	1
she	1
squeezed	1
herself	1
up	1
closer	1
to	1
Alice's	1
side	1
as	1
she	1
spoke.	1
Alice	1
did	1
not	1
much	1
like	1
keeping	1
so	1
close	1
to	1
her:	1
first,	1
because	1
the	1
Duchess	1
was	1
VERY	1
ugly;	1
and	1
secondly,	1
because	1
she	1
was	1
exactly	1
the	1
right	1
height	1
to	1
rest	1
her	1
chin	1
upon	1
Alice's	1
shoulder,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
an	1
uncomfortably	1
sharp	1
chin.	1
However,	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
to	1
be	1
rude,	1
so	1
she	1
bore	1
it	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
she	1
could.	1
'The	1
game's	1
going	1
on	1
rather	1
better	1
now,'	1
she	1
said,	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
keeping	1
up	1
the	1
conversation	1
a	1
little.	1
''Tis	1
so,'	1
said	1
the	1
Duchess:	1
'and	1
the	1
moral	1
of	1
that	1
is--"Oh,	1
'tis	1
love,	1
'tis	1
love,	1
that	1
makes	1
the	1
world	1
go	1
round!"'	1
'Somebody	1
said,'	1
Alice	1
whispered,	1
'that	1
it's	1
done	1
by	1
everybody	1
minding	1
their	1
own	1
business!'	1
'Ah,	1
well!	1
It	1
means	1
much	1
the	1
same	1
thing,'	1
said	1
the	1
Duchess,	1
digging	1
her	1
sharp	1
little	1
chin	1
into	1
Alice's	1
shoulder	1
as	1
she	1
added,	1
'and	1
the	1
moral	1
of	1
THAT	1
is--"Take	1
care	1
of	1
the	1
sense,	1
and	1
the	1
sounds	1
will	1
take	1
care	1
of	1
themselves."'	1
'How	1
fond	1
she	1
is	1
of	1
finding	1
morals	1
in	1
things!'	1
Alice	1
thought	1
to	1
herself.	1
'I	1
dare	1
say	1
you're	1
wondering	1
why	1
I	1
don't	1
put	1
my	1
arm	1
round	1
your	1
waist,'	1
the	1
Duchess	1
said	1
after	1
a	1
pause:	1
'the	1
reason	1
is,	1
that	1
I'm	1
doubtful	1
about	1
the	1
temper	1
of	1
your	1
flamingo.	1
Shall	1
I	1
try	1
the	1
experiment?'	1
'HE	1
might	1
bite,'	1
Alice	1
cautiously	1
replied,	1
not	1
feeling	1
at	1
all	1
anxious	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
experiment	1
tried.	1
'Very	1
true,'	1
said	1
the	1
Duchess:	1
'flamingoes	1
and	1
mustard	1
both	1
bite.	1
And	1
the	1
moral	1
of	1
that	1
is--"Birds	1
of	1
a	1
feather	1
flock	1
together."'	1
'Only	1
mustard	1
isn't	1
a	1
bird,'	1
Alice	1
remarked.	1
'Right,	1
as	1
usual,'	1
said	1
the	1
Duchess:	1
'what	1
a	1
clear	1
way	1
you	1
have	1
of	1
putting	1
things!'	1
'It's	1
a	1
mineral,	1
I	1
THINK,'	1
said	1
Alice.	1
'Of	1
course	1
it	1
is,'	1
said	1
the	1
Duchess,	1
who	1
seemed	1
ready	1
to	1
agree	1
to	1
everything	1
that	1
Alice	1
said;	1
'there's	1
a	1
large	1
mustard-mine	1
near	1
here.	1
And	1
the	1
moral	1
of	1
that	1
is--"The	1
more	1
there	1
is	1
of	1
mine,	1
the	1
less	1
there	1
is	1
of	1
yours."'	1
'Oh,	1
I	1
know!'	1
exclaimed	1
Alice,	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
attended	1
to	1
this	1
last	1
remark,	1
'it's	1
a	1
vegetable.	1
It	1
doesn't	1
look	1
like	1
one,	1
but	1
it	1
is.'	1
'I	1
quite	1
agree	1
with	1
you,'	1
said	1
the	1
Duchess;	1
'and	1
the	1
moral	1
of	1
that	1
is--"Be	1
what	1
you	1
would	1
seem	1
to	1
be"--or	1
if	1
you'd	1
like	1
it	1
put	1
more	1
simply--"Never	1
imagine	1
yourself	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
otherwise	1
than	1
what	1
it	1
might	1
appear	1
to	1
others	1
that	1
what	1
you	1
were	1
or	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
was	1
not	1
otherwise	1
than	1
what	1
you	1
had	1
been	1
would	1
have	1
appeared	1
to	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
otherwise."'	1
'I	1
think	1
I	1
should	1
understand	1
that	1
better,'	1
Alice	1
said	1
very	1
politely,	1
'if	1
I	1
had	1
it	1
written	1
down:	1
but	1
I	1
can't	1
quite	1
follow	1
it	1
as	1
you	1
say	1
it.'	1
'That's	1
nothing	1
to	1
what	1
I	1
could	1
say	1
if	1
I	1
chose,'	1
the	1
Duchess	1
replied,	1
in	1
a	1
pleased	1
tone.	1
'Pray	1
don't	1
trouble	1
yourself	1
to	1
say	1
it	1
any	1
longer	1
than	1
that,'	1
said	1
Alice.	1
'Oh,	1
don't	1
talk	1
about	1
trouble!'	1
said	1
the	1
Duchess.	1
'I	1
make	1
you	1
a	1
present	1
of	1
everything	1
I've	1
said	1
as	1
yet.'	1
'A	1
cheap	1
sort	1
of	1
present!'	1
thought	1
Alice.	1
'I'm	1
glad	1
they	1
don't	1
give	1
birthday	1
presents	1
like	1
that!'	1
But	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
venture	1
to	1
say	1
it	1
out	1
loud.	1
'Thinking	1
again?'	1
the	1
Duchess	1
asked,	1
with	1
another	1
dig	1
of	1
her	1
sharp	1
little	1
chin.	1
'I've	1
a	1
right	1
to	1
think,'	1
said	1
Alice	1
sharply,	1
for	1
she	1
was	1
beginning	1
to	1
feel	1
a	1
little	1
worried.	1
'Just	1
about	1
as	1
much	1
right,'	1
said	1
the	1
Duchess,	1
'as	1
pigs	1
have	1
to	1
fly;	1
and	1
the	1
m--'	1
But	1
here,	1
to	1
Alice's	1
great	1
surprise,	1
the	1
Duchess's	1
voice	1
died	1
away,	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
her	1
favourite	1
word	1
'moral,'	1
and	1
the	1
arm	1
that	1
was	1
linked	1
into	1
hers	1
began	1
to	1
tremble.	1
Alice	1
looked	1
up,	1
and	1
there	1
stood	1
the	1
Queen	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
them,	1
with	1
her	1
arms	1
folded,	1
frowning	1
like	1
a	1
thunderstorm.	1
'A	1
fine	1
day,	1
your	1
Majesty!'	1
the	1
Duchess	1
began	1
in	1
a	1
low,	1
weak	1
voice.	1
'Now,	1
I	1
give	1
you	1
fair	1
warning,'	1
shouted	1
the	1
Queen,	1
stamping	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
as	1
she	1
spoke;	1
'either	1
you	1
or	1
your	1
head	1
must	1
be	1
off,	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
about	1
half	1
no	1
time!	1
Take	1
your	1
choice!'	1
The	1
Duchess	1
took	1
her	1
choice,	1
and	1
was	1
gone	1
in	1
a	1
moment.	1
'Let's	1
go	1
on	1
with	1
the	1
game,'	1
the	1
Queen	1
said	1
to	1
Alice;	1
and	1
Alice	1
was	1
too	1
much	1
frightened	1
to	1
say	1
a	1
word,	1
but	1
slowly	1
followed	1
her	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
croquet-ground.	1
The	1
other	1
guests	1
had	1
taken	1
advantage	1
of	1
the	1
Queen's	1
absence,	1
and	1
were	1
resting	1
in	1
the	1
shade:	1
however,	1
the	1
moment	1
they	1
saw	1
her,	1
they	1
hurried	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
game,	1
the	1
Queen	1
merely	1
remarking	1
that	1
a	1
moment's	1
delay	1
would	1
cost	1
them	1
their	1
lives.	1
All	1
the	1
time	1
they	1
were	1
playing	1
the	1
Queen	1
never	1
left	1
off	1
quarrelling	1
with	1
the	1
other	1
players,	1
and	1
shouting	1
'Off	1
with	1
his	1
head!'	1
or	1
'Off	1
with	1
her	1
head!'	1
Those	1
whom	1
she	1
sentenced	1
were	1
taken	1
into	1
custody	1
by	1
the	1
soldiers,	1
who	1
of	1
course	1
had	1
to	1
leave	1
off	1
being	1
arches	1
to	1
do	1
this,	1
so	1
that	1
by	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
or	1
so	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
arches	1
left,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
players,	1
except	1
the	1
King,	1
the	1
Queen,	1
and	1
Alice,	1
were	1
in	1
custody	1
and	1
under	1
sentence	1
of	1
execution.	1
Then	1
the	1
Queen	1
left	1
off,	1
quite	1
out	1
of	1
breath,	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
Alice,	1
'Have	1
you	1
seen	1
the	1
Mock	1
Turtle	1
yet?'	1
'No,'	1
said	1
Alice.	1
'I	1
don't	1
even	1
know	1
what	1
a	1
Mock	1
Turtle	1
is.'	1
'It's	1
the	1
thing	1
Mock	1
Turtle	1
Soup	1
is	1
made	1
from,'	1
said	1
the	1
Queen.	1
'I	1
never	1
saw	1
one,	1
or	1
heard	1
of	1
one,'	1
said	1
Alice.	1
'Come	1
on,	1
then,'	1
said	1
the	1
Queen,	1
'and	1
he	1
shall	1
tell	1
you	1
his	1
history,'	1
As	1
they	1
walked	1
off	1
together,	1
Alice	1
heard	1
the	1
King	1
say	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice,	1
to	1
the	1
company	1
generally,	1
'You	1
are	1
all	1
pardoned.'	1
'Come,	1
THAT'S	1
a	1
good	1
thing!'	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself,	1
for	1
she	1
had	1
felt	1
quite	1
unhappy	1
at	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
executions	1
the	1
Queen	1
had	1
ordered.	1
They	1
very	1
soon	1
came	1
upon	1
a	1
Gryphon,	1
lying	1
fast	1
asleep	1
in	1
the	1
sun.	1
(IF	1
you	1
don't	1
know	1
what	1
a	1
Gryphon	1
is,	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
picture.)	1
'Up,	1
lazy	1
thing!'	1
said	1
the	1
Queen,	1
'and	1
take	1
this	1
young	1
lady	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
Mock	1
Turtle,	1
and	1
to	1
hear	1
his	1
history.	1
I	1
must	1
go	1
back	1
and	1
see	1
after	1
some	1
executions	1
I	1
have	1
ordered';	1
and	1
she	1
walked	1
off,	1
leaving	1
Alice	1
alone	1
with	1
the	1
Gryphon.	1
Alice	1
did	1
not	1
quite	1
like	1
the	1
look	1
of	1
the	1
creature,	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
whole	1
she	1
thought	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
quite	1
as	1
safe	1
to	1
stay	1
with	1
it	1
as	1
to	1
go	1
after	1
that	1
savage	1
Queen:	1
so	1
she	1
waited.	1
The	1
Gryphon	1
sat	1
up	1
and	1
rubbed	1
its	1
eyes:	1
then	1
it	1
watched	1
the	1
Queen	1
till	1
she	1
was	1
out	1
of	1
sight:	1
then	1
it	1
chuckled.	1
'What	1
fun!'	1
said	1
the	1
Gryphon,	1
half	1
to	1
itself,	1
half	1
to	1
Alice.	1
'What	1
IS	1
the	1
fun?'	1
said	1
Alice.	1
'Why,	1
SHE,'	1
said	1
the	1
Gryphon.	1
'It's	1
all	1
her	1
fancy,	1
that:	1
they	1
never	1
executes	1
nobody,	1
you	1
know.	1
Come	1
on!'	1
'Everybody	1
says	1
"come	1
on!"	1
here,'	1
thought	1
Alice,	1
as	1
she	1
went	1
slowly	1
after	1
it:	1
'I	1
never	1
was	1
so	1
ordered	1
about	1
in	1
all	1
my	1
life,	1
never!'	1
They	1
had	1
not	1
gone	1
far	1
before	1
they	1
saw	1
the	1
Mock	1
Turtle	1
in	1
the	1
distance,	1
sitting	1
sad	1
and	1
lonely	1
on	1
a	1
little	1
ledge	1
of	1
rock,	1
and,	1
as	1
they	1
came	1
nearer,	1
Alice	1
could	1
hear	1
him	1
sighing	1
as	1
if	1
his	1
heart	1
would	1
break.	1
She	1
pitied	1
him	1
deeply.	1
'What	1
is	1
his	1
sorrow?'	1
she	1
asked	1
the	1
Gryphon,	1
and	1
the	1
Gryphon	1
answered,	1
very	1
nearly	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
words	1
as	1
before,	1
'It's	1
all	1
his	1
fancy,	1
that:	1
he	1
hasn't	1
got	1
no	1
sorrow,	1
you	1
know.	1
Come	1
on!'	1
So	1
they	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
Mock	1
Turtle,	1
who	1
looked	1
at	1
them	1
with	1
large	1
eyes	1
full	1
of	1
tears,	1
but	1
said	1
nothing.	1
'This	1
here	1
young	1
lady,'	1
said	1
the	1
Gryphon,	1
'she	1
wants	1
for	1
to	1
know	1
your	1
history,	1
she	1
do.'	1
'I'll	1
tell	1
it	1
her,'	1
said	1
the	1
Mock	1
Turtle	1
in	1
a	1
deep,	1
hollow	1
tone:	1
'sit	1
down,	1
both	1
of	1
you,	1
and	1
don't	1
speak	1
a	1
word	1
till	1
I've	1
finished.'	1
So	1
they	1
sat	1
down,	1
and	1
nobody	1
spoke	1
for	1
some	1
minutes.	1
Alice	1
thought	1
to	1
herself,	1
'I	1
don't	1
see	1
how	1
he	1
can	1
EVEN	1
finish,	1
if	1
he	1
doesn't	1
begin.'	1
But	1
she	1
waited	1
patiently.	1
'Once,'	1
said	1
the	1
Mock	1
Turtle	1
at	1
last,	1
with	1
a	1
deep	1
sigh,	1
'I	1
was	1
a	1
real	1
Turtle.'	1
These	1
words	1
were	1
followed	1
by	1
a	1
very	1
long	1
silence,	1
broken	1
only	1
by	1
an	1
occasional	1
exclamation	1
of	1
'Hjckrrh!'	1
from	1
the	1
Gryphon,	1
and	1
the	1
constant	1
heavy	1
sobbing	1
of	1
the	1
Mock	1
Turtle.	1
Alice	1
was	1
very	1
nearly	1
getting	1
up	1
and	1
saying,	1
'Thank	1
you,	1
sir,	1
for	1
your	1
interesting	1
story,'	1
but	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
thinking	1
there	1
MUST	1
be	1
more	1
to	1
come,	1
so	1
she	1
sat	1
still	1
and	1
said	1
nothing.	1
'When	1
we	1
were	1
little,'	1
the	1
Mock	1
Turtle	1
went	1
on	1
at	1
last,	1
more	1
calmly,	1
though	1
still	1
sobbing	1
a	1
little	1
now	1
and	1
then,	1
'we	1
went	1
to	1
school	1
in	1
the	1
sea.	1
The	1
master	1
was	1
an	1
old	1
Turtle--we	1
used	1
to	1
call	1
him	1
Tortoise--'	1
'Why	1
did	1
you	1
call	1
him	1
Tortoise,	1
if	1
he	1
wasn't	1
one?'	1
Alice	1
asked.	1
'We	1
called	1
him	1
Tortoise	1
because	1
he	1
taught	1
us,'	1
said	1
the	1
Mock	1
Turtle	1
angrily:	1
'really	1
you	1
are	1
very	1
dull!'	1
'You	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
ashamed	1
of	1
yourself	1
for	1
asking	1
such	1
a	1
simple	1
question,'	1
added	1
the	1
Gryphon;	1
and	1
then	1
they	1
both	1
sat	1
silent	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
poor	1
Alice,	1
who	1
felt	1
ready	1
to	1
sink	1
into	1
the	1
earth.	1
At	1
last	1
the	1
Gryphon	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
Mock	1
Turtle,	1
'Drive	1
on,	1
old	1
fellow!	1
Don't	1
be	1
all	1
day	1
about	1
it!'	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
in	1
these	1
words:	1
'Yes,	1
we	1
went	1
to	1
school	1
in	1
the	1
sea,	1
though	1
you	1
mayn't	1
believe	1
it--'	1
'I	1
never	1
said	1
I	1
didn't!'	1
interrupted	1
Alice.	1
'You	1
did,'	1
said	1
the	1
Mock	1
Turtle.	1
'Hold	1
your	1
tongue!'	1
added	1
the	1
Gryphon,	1
before	1
Alice	1
could	1
speak	1
again.	1
The	1
Mock	1
Turtle	1
went	1
on.	1
'We	1
had	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
educations--in	1
fact,	1
we	1
went	1
to	1
school	1
every	1
day--'	1
'I'VE	1
been	1
to	1
a	1
day-school,	1
too,'	1
said	1
Alice;	1
'you	1
needn't	1
be	1
so	1
proud	1
as	1
all	1
that.'	1
'With	1
extras?'	1
asked	1
the	1
Mock	1
Turtle	1
a	1
little	1
anxiously.	1
'Yes,'	1
said	1
Alice,	1
'we	1
learned	1
French	1
and	1
music.'	1
'And	1
washing?'	1
said	1
the	1
Mock	1
Turtle.	1
'Certainly	1
not!'	1
said	1
Alice	1
indignantly.	1
'Ah!	1
then	1
yours	1
wasn't	1
a	1
really	1
good	1
school,'	1
said	1
the	1
Mock	1
Turtle	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
of	1
great	1
relief.	1
'Now	1
at	1
OURS	1
they	1
had	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
bill,	1
"French,	1
music,	1
AND	1
WASHING--extra."'	1
'You	1
couldn't	1
have	1
wanted	1
it	1
much,'	1
said	1
Alice;	1
'living	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
sea.'	1
'I	1
couldn't	1
afford	1
to	1
learn	1
it.'	1
said	1
the	1
Mock	1
Turtle	1
with	1
a	1
sigh.	1
'I	1
only	1
took	1
the	1
regular	1
course.'	1
'What	1
was	1
that?'	1
inquired	1
Alice.	1
'Reeling	1
and	1
Writhing,	1
of	1
course,	1
to	1
begin	1
with,'	1
the	1
Mock	1
Turtle	1
replied;	1
'and	1
then	1
the	1
different	1
branches	1
of	1
Arithmetic--Ambition,	1
Distraction,	1
Uglification,	1
and	1
Derision.'	1
'I	1
never	1
heard	1
of	1
"Uglification,"'	1
Alice	1
ventured	1
to	1
say.	1
'What	1
is	1
it?'	1
The	1
Gryphon	1
lifted	1
up	1
both	1
its	1
paws	1
in	1
surprise.	1
'What!	1
Never	1
heard	1
of	1
uglifying!'	1
it	1
exclaimed.	1
'You	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
beautify	1
is,	1
I	1
suppose?'	1
'Yes,'	1
said	1
Alice	1
doubtfully:	1
'it	1
means--to--make--anything--prettier.'	1
'Well,	1
then,'	1
the	1
Gryphon	1
went	1
on,	1
'if	1
you	1
don't	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
uglify	1
is,	1
you	1
ARE	1
a	1
simpleton.'	1
Alice	1
did	1
not	1
feel	1
encouraged	1
to	1
ask	1
any	1
more	1
questions	1
about	1
it,	1
so	1
she	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
Mock	1
Turtle,	1
and	1
said	1
'What	1
else	1
had	1
you	1
to	1
learn?'	1
'Well,	1
there	1
was	1
Mystery,'	1
the	1
Mock	1
Turtle	1
replied,	1
counting	1
off	1
the	1
subjects	1
on	1
his	1
flappers,	1
'--Mystery,	1
ancient	1
and	1
modern,	1
with	1
Seaography:	1
then	1
Drawling--the	1
Drawling-master	1
was	1
an	1
old	1
conger-eel,	1
that	1
used	1
to	1
come	1
once	1
a	1
week:	1
HE	1
taught	1
us	1
Drawling,	1
Stretching,	1
and	1
Fainting	1
in	1
Coils.'	1
'What	1
was	1
THAT	1
like?'	1
said	1
Alice.	1
'Well,	1
I	1
can't	1
show	1
it	1
you	1
myself,'	1
the	1
Mock	1
Turtle	1
said:	1
'I'm	1
too	1
stiff.	1
And	1
the	1
Gryphon	1
never	1
learnt	1
it.'	1
'Hadn't	1
time,'	1
said	1
the	1
Gryphon:	1
'I	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
Classics	1
master,	1
though.	1
He	1
was	1
an	1
old	1
crab,	1
HE	1
was.'	1
'I	1
never	1
went	1
to	1
him,'	1
the	1
Mock	1
Turtle	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
sigh:	1
'he	1
taught	1
Laughing	1
and	1
Grief,	1
they	1
used	1
to	1
say.'	1
'So	1
he	1
did,	1
so	1
he	1
did,'	1
said	1
the	1
Gryphon,	1
sighing	1
in	1
his	1
turn;	1
and	1
both	1
creatures	1
hid	1
their	1
faces	1
in	1
their	1
paws.	1
'And	1
how	1
many	1
hours	1
a	1
day	1
did	1
you	1
do	1
lessons?'	1
said	1
Alice,	1
in	1
a	1
hurry	1
to	1
change	1
the	1
subject.	1
'Ten	1
hours	1
the	1
first	1
day,'	1
said	1
the	1
Mock	1
Turtle:	1
'nine	1
the	1
next,	1
and	1
so	1
on.'	1
'What	1
a	1
curious	1
plan!'	1
exclaimed	1
Alice.	1
'That's	1
the	1
reason	1
they're	1
called	1
lessons,'	1
the	1
Gryphon	1
remarked:	1
'because	1
they	1
lessen	1
from	1
day	1
to	1
day.'	1
This	1
was	1
quite	1
a	1
new	1
idea	1
to	1
Alice,	1
and	1
she	1
thought	1
it	1
over	1
a	1
little	1
before	1
she	1
made	1
her	1
next	1
remark.	1
'Then	1
the	1
eleventh	1
day	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
holiday?'	1
'Of	1
course	1
it	1
was,'	1
said	1
the	1
Mock	1
Turtle.	1
'And	1
how	1
did	1
you	1
manage	1
on	1
the	1
twelfth?'	1
Alice	1
went	1
on	1
eagerly.	1
'That's	1
enough	1
about	1
lessons,'	1
the	1
Gryphon	1
interrupted	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
decided	1
tone:	1
'tell	1
her	1
something	1
about	1
the	1
games	1
now.'	1
CHAPTER	1
X.	1
The	1
Lobster	1
Quadrille	1
The	1
Mock	1
Turtle	1
sighed	1
deeply,	1
and	1
drew	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
one	1
flapper	1
across	1
his	1
eyes.	1
He	1
looked	1
at	1
Alice,	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
speak,	1
but	1
for	1
a	1
minute	1
or	1
two	1
sobs	1
choked	1
his	1
voice.	1
'Same	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
bone	1
in	1
his	1
throat,'	1
said	1
the	1
Gryphon:	1
and	1
it	1
set	1
to	1
work	1
shaking	1
him	1
and	1
punching	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
back.	1
At	1
last	1
the	1
Mock	1
Turtle	1
recovered	1
his	1
voice,	1
and,	1
with	1
tears	1
running	1
down	1
his	1
cheeks,	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
again:--	1
'You	1
may	1
not	1
have	1
lived	1
much	1
under	1
the	1
sea--'	1
('I	1
haven't,'	1
said	1
Alice)--'and	1
perhaps	1
you	1
were	1
never	1
even	1
introduced	1
to	1
a	1
lobster--'	1
(Alice	1
began	1
to	1
say	1
'I	1
once	1
tasted--'	1
but	1
checked	1
herself	1
hastily,	1
and	1
said	1
'No,	1
never')	1
'--so	1
you	1
can	1
have	1
no	1
idea	1
what	1
a	1
delightful	1
thing	1
a	1
Lobster	1
Quadrille	1
is!'	1
'No,	1
indeed,'	1
said	1
Alice.	1
'What	1
sort	1
of	1
a	1
dance	1
is	1
it?'	1
'Why,'	1
said	1
the	1
Gryphon,	1
'you	1
first	1
form	1
into	1
a	1
line	1
along	1
the	1
sea-shore--'	1
'Two	1
lines!'	1
cried	1
the	1
Mock	1
Turtle.	1
'Seals,	1
turtles,	1
salmon,	1
and	1
so	1
on;	1
then,	1
when	1
you've	1
cleared	1
all	1
the	1
jelly-fish	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way--'	1
'THAT	1
generally	1
takes	1
some	1
time,'	1
interrupted	1
the	1
Gryphon.	1
'--you	1
advance	1
twice--'	1
'Each	1
with	1
a	1
lobster	1
as	1
a	1
partner!'	1
cried	1
the	1
Gryphon.	1
'Of	1
course,'	1
the	1
Mock	1
Turtle	1
said:	1
'advance	1
twice,	1
set	1
to	1
partners--'	1
'--change	1
lobsters,	1
and	1
retire	1
in	1
same	1
order,'	1
continued	1
the	1
Gryphon.	1
'Then,	1
you	1
know,'	1
the	1
Mock	1
Turtle	1
went	1
on,	1
'you	1
throw	1
the--'	1
'The	1
lobsters!'	1
shouted	1
the	1
Gryphon,	1
with	1
a	1
bound	1
into	1
the	1
air.	1
'--as	1
far	1
out	1
to	1
sea	1
as	1
you	1
can--'	1
'Swim	1
after	1
them!'	1
screamed	1
the	1
Gryphon.	1
'Turn	1
a	1
somersault	1
in	1
the	1
sea!'	1
cried	1
the	1
Mock	1
Turtle,	1
capering	1
wildly	1
about.	1
'Change	1
lobsters	1
again!'	1
yelled	1
the	1
Gryphon	1
at	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
its	1
voice.	1
'Back	1
to	1
land	1
again,	1
and	1
that's	1
all	1
the	1
first	1
figure,'	1
said	1
the	1
Mock	1
Turtle,	1
suddenly	1
dropping	1
his	1
voice;	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
creatures,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
jumping	1
about	1
like	1
mad	1
things	1
all	1
this	1
time,	1
sat	1
down	1
again	1
very	1
sadly	1
and	1
quietly,	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
Alice.	1
'It	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
very	1
pretty	1
dance,'	1
said	1
Alice	1
timidly.	1
'Would	1
you	1
like	1
to	1
see	1
a	1
little	1
of	1
it?'	1
said	1
the	1
Mock	1
Turtle.	1
'Very	1
much	1
indeed,'	1
said	1
Alice.	1
'Come,	1
let's	1
try	1
the	1
first	1
figure!'	1
said	1
the	1
Mock	1
Turtle	1
to	1
the	1
Gryphon.	1
'We	1
can	1
do	1
without	1
lobsters,	1
you	1
know.	1
Which	1
shall	1
sing?'	1
'Oh,	1
YOU	1
sing,'	1
said	1
the	1
Gryphon.	1
'I've	1
forgotten	1
the	1
words.'	1
So	1
they	1
began	1
solemnly	1
dancing	1
round	1
and	1
round	1
Alice,	1
every	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
treading	1
on	1
her	1
toes	1
when	1
they	1
passed	1
too	1
close,	1
and	1
waving	1
their	1
forepaws	1
to	1
mark	1
the	1
time,	1
while	1
the	1
Mock	1
Turtle	1
sang	1
this,	1
very	1
slowly	1
and	1
sadly:--	1
'"Will	1
you	1
walk	1
a	1
little	1
faster?"	1
said	1
a	1
whiting	1
to	1
a	1
snail.	1
"There's	1
a	1
porpoise	1
close	1
behind	1
us,	1
and	1
he's	1
treading	1
on	1
my	1
tail.	1
See	1
how	1
eagerly	1
the	1
lobsters	1
and	1
the	1
turtles	1
all	1
advance!	1
They	1
are	1
waiting	1
on	1
the	1
shingle--will	1
you	1
come	1
and	1
join	1
the	1
dance?	1
Will	1
you,	1
won't	1
you,	1
will	1
you,	1
won't	1
you,	1
will	1
you	1
join	1
the	1
dance?	1
Will	1
you,	1
won't	1
you,	1
will	1
you,	1
won't	1
you,	1
won't	1
you	1
join	1
the	1
dance?	1
"You	1
can	1
really	1
have	1
no	1
notion	1
how	1
delightful	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
When	1
they	1
take	1
us	1
up	1
and	1
throw	1
us,	1
with	1
the	1
lobsters,	1
out	1
to	1
sea!"	1
But	1
the	1
snail	1
replied	1
"Too	1
far,	1
too	1
far!"	1
and	1
gave	1
a	1
look	1
askance--	1
Said	1
he	1
thanked	1
the	1
whiting	1
kindly,	1
but	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
join	1
the	1
dance.	1
Would	1
not,	1
could	1
not,	1
would	1
not,	1
could	1
not,	1
would	1
not	1
join	1
the	1
dance.	1
Would	1
not,	1
could	1
not,	1
would	1
not,	1
could	1
not,	1
could	1
not	1
join	1
the	1
dance.	1
'"What	1
matters	1
it	1
how	1
far	1
we	1
go?"	1
his	1
scaly	1
friend	1
replied.	1
"There	1
is	1
another	1
shore,	1
you	1
know,	1
upon	1
the	1
other	1
side.	1
The	1
further	1
off	1
from	1
England	1
the	1
nearer	1
is	1
to	1
France--	1
Then	1
turn	1
not	1
pale,	1
beloved	1
snail,	1
but	1
come	1
and	1
join	1
the	1
dance.	1
Will	1
you,	1
won't	1
you,	1
will	1
you,	1
won't	1
you,	1
will	1
you	1
join	1
the	1
dance?	1
Will	1
you,	1
won't	1
you,	1
will	1
you,	1
won't	1
you,	1
won't	1
you	1
join	1
the	1
dance?"'	1
'Thank	1
you,	1
it's	1
a	1
very	1
interesting	1
dance	1
to	1
watch,'	1
said	1
Alice,	1
feeling	1
very	1
glad	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
over	1
at	1
last:	1
'and	1
I	1
do	1
so	1
like	1
that	1
curious	1
song	1
about	1
the	1
whiting!'	1
'Oh,	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
whiting,'	1
said	1
the	1
Mock	1
Turtle,	1
'they--you've	1
seen	1
them,	1
of	1
course?'	1
'Yes,'	1
said	1
Alice,	1
'I've	1
often	1
seen	1
them	1
at	1
dinn--'	1
she	1
checked	1
herself	1
hastily.	1
'I	1
don't	1
know	1
where	1
Dinn	1
may	1
be,'	1
said	1
the	1
Mock	1
Turtle,	1
'but	1
if	1
you've	1
seen	1
them	1
so	1
often,	1
of	1
course	1
you	1
know	1
what	1
they're	1
like.'	1
'I	1
believe	1
so,'	1
Alice	1
replied	1
thoughtfully.	1
'They	1
have	1
their	1
tails	1
in	1
their	1
mouths--and	1
they're	1
all	1
over	1
crumbs.'	1
'You're	1
wrong	1
about	1
the	1
crumbs,'	1
said	1
the	1
Mock	1
Turtle:	1
'crumbs	1
would	1
all	1
wash	1
off	1
in	1
the	1
sea.	1
But	1
they	1
HAVE	1
their	1
tails	1
in	1
their	1
mouths;	1
and	1
the	1
reason	1
is--'	1
here	1
the	1
Mock	1
Turtle	1
yawned	1
and	1
shut	1
his	1
eyes.--'Tell	1
her	1
about	1
the	1
reason	1
and	1
all	1
that,'	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
Gryphon.	1
'The	1
reason	1
is,'	1
said	1
the	1
Gryphon,	1
'that	1
they	1
WOULD	1
go	1
with	1
the	1
lobsters	1
to	1
the	1
dance.	1
So	1
they	1
got	1
thrown	1
out	1
to	1
sea.	1
So	1
they	1
had	1
to	1
fall	1
a	1
long	1
way.	1
So	1
they	1
got	1
their	1
tails	1
fast	1
in	1
their	1
mouths.	1
So	1
they	1
couldn't	1
get	1
them	1
out	1
again.	1
That's	1
all.'	1
'Thank	1
you,'	1
said	1
Alice,	1
'it's	1
very	1
interesting.	1
I	1
never	1
knew	1
so	1
much	1
about	1
a	1
whiting	1
before.'	1
'I	1
can	1
tell	1
you	1
more	1
than	1
that,	1
if	1
you	1
like,'	1
said	1
the	1
Gryphon.	1
'Do	1
you	1
know	1
why	1
it's	1
called	1
a	1
whiting?'	1
'I	1
never	1
thought	1
about	1
it,'	1
said	1
Alice.	1
'Why?'	1
'IT	1
DOES	1
THE	1
BOOTS	1
AND	1
SHOES.'	1
the	1
Gryphon	1
replied	1
very	1
solemnly.	1
Alice	1
was	1
thoroughly	1
puzzled.	1
'Does	1
the	1
boots	1
and	1
shoes!'	1
she	1
repeated	1
in	1
a	1
wondering	1
tone.	1
'Why,	1
what	1
are	1
YOUR	1
shoes	1
done	1
with?'	1
said	1
the	1
Gryphon.	1
'I	1
mean,	1
what	1
makes	1
them	1
so	1
shiny?'	1
Alice	1
looked	1
down	1
at	1
them,	1
and	1
considered	1
a	1
little	1
before	1
she	1
gave	1
her	1
answer.	1
'They're	1
done	1
with	1
blacking,	1
I	1
believe.'	1
'Boots	1
and	1
shoes	1
under	1
the	1
sea,'	1
the	1
Gryphon	1
went	1
on	1
in	1
a	1
deep	1
voice,	1
'are	1
done	1
with	1
a	1
whiting.	1
Now	1
you	1
know.'	1
'And	1
what	1
are	1
they	1
made	1
of?'	1
Alice	1
asked	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
of	1
great	1
curiosity.	1
'Soles	1
and	1
eels,	1
of	1
course,'	1
the	1
Gryphon	1
replied	1
rather	1
impatiently:	1
'any	1
shrimp	1
could	1
have	1
told	1
you	1
that.'	1
'If	1
I'd	1
been	1
the	1
whiting,'	1
said	1
Alice,	1
whose	1
thoughts	1
were	1
still	1
running	1
on	1
the	1
song,	1
'I'd	1
have	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
porpoise,	1
"Keep	1
back,	1
please:	1
we	1
don't	1
want	1
YOU	1
with	1
us!"'	1
'They	1
were	1
obliged	1
to	1
have	1
him	1
with	1
them,'	1
the	1
Mock	1
Turtle	1
said:	1
'no	1
wise	1
fish	1
would	1
go	1
anywhere	1
without	1
a	1
porpoise.'	1
'Wouldn't	1
it	1
really?'	1
said	1
Alice	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
of	1
great	1
surprise.	1
'Of	1
course	1
not,'	1
said	1
the	1
Mock	1
Turtle:	1
'why,	1
if	1
a	1
fish	1
came	1
to	1
ME,	1
and	1
told	1
me	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
a	1
journey,	1
I	1
should	1
say	1
"With	1
what	1
porpoise?"'	1
'Don't	1
you	1
mean	1
"purpose"?'	1
said	1
Alice.	1
'I	1
mean	1
what	1
I	1
say,'	1
the	1
Mock	1
Turtle	1
replied	1
in	1
an	1
offended	1
tone.	1
And	1
the	1
Gryphon	1
added	1
'Come,	1
let's	1
hear	1
some	1
of	1
YOUR	1
adventures.'	1
'I	1
could	1
tell	1
you	1
my	1
adventures--beginning	1
from	1
this	1
morning,'	1
said	1
Alice	1
a	1
little	1
timidly:	1
'but	1
it's	1
no	1
use	1
going	1
back	1
to	1
yesterday,	1
because	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
different	1
person	1
then.'	1
'Explain	1
all	1
that,'	1
said	1
the	1
Mock	1
Turtle.	1
'No,	1
no!	1
The	1
adventures	1
first,'	1
said	1
the	1
Gryphon	1
in	1
an	1
impatient	1
tone:	1
'explanations	1
take	1
such	1
a	1
dreadful	1
time.'	1
So	1
Alice	1
began	1
telling	1
them	1
her	1
adventures	1
from	1
the	1
time	1
when	1
she	1
first	1
saw	1
the	1
White	1
Rabbit.	1
She	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
nervous	1
about	1
it	1
just	1
at	1
first,	1
the	1
two	1
creatures	1
got	1
so	1
close	1
to	1
her,	1
one	1
on	1
each	1
side,	1
and	1
opened	1
their	1
eyes	1
and	1
mouths	1
so	1
VERY	1
wide,	1
but	1
she	1
gained	1
courage	1
as	1
she	1
went	1
on.	1
Her	1
listeners	1
were	1
perfectly	1
quiet	1
till	1
she	1
got	1
to	1
the	1
part	1
about	1
her	1
repeating	1
'YOU	1
ARE	1
OLD,	1
FATHER	1
WILLIAM,'	1
to	1
the	1
Caterpillar,	1
and	1
the	1
words	1
all	1
coming	1
different,	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
Mock	1
Turtle	1
drew	1
a	1
long	1
breath,	1
and	1
said	1
'That's	1
very	1
curious.'	1
'It's	1
all	1
about	1
as	1
curious	1
as	1
it	1
can	1
be,'	1
said	1
the	1
Gryphon.	1
'It	1
all	1
came	1
different!'	1
the	1
Mock	1
Turtle	1
repeated	1
thoughtfully.	1
'I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
hear	1
her	1
try	1
and	1
repeat	1
something	1
now.	1
Tell	1
her	1
to	1
begin.'	1
He	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
Gryphon	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
thought	1
it	1
had	1
some	1
kind	1
of	1
authority	1
over	1
Alice.	1
'Stand	1
up	1
and	1
repeat	1
"'TIS	1
THE	1
VOICE	1
OF	1
THE	1
SLUGGARD,"'	1
said	1
the	1
Gryphon.	1
'How	1
the	1
creatures	1
order	1
one	1
about,	1
and	1
make	1
one	1
repeat	1
lessons!'	1
thought	1
Alice;	1
'I	1
might	1
as	1
well	1
be	1
at	1
school	1
at	1
once.'	1
However,	1
she	1
got	1
up,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
repeat	1
it,	1
but	1
her	1
head	1
was	1
so	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
Lobster	1
Quadrille,	1
that	1
she	1
hardly	1
knew	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
saying,	1
and	1
the	1
words	1
came	1
very	1
queer	1
indeed:--	1
''Tis	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
Lobster;	1
I	1
heard	1
him	1
declare,	1
"You	1
have	1
baked	1
me	1
too	1
brown,	1
I	1
must	1
sugar	1
my	1
hair."	1
As	1
a	1
duck	1
with	1
its	1
eyelids,	1
so	1
he	1
with	1
his	1
nose	1
Trims	1
his	1
belt	1
and	1
his	1
buttons,	1
and	1
turns	1
out	1
his	1
toes.'	1
[later	1
editions	1
continued	1
as	1
follows	1
When	1
the	1
sands	1
are	1
all	1
dry,	1
he	1
is	1
gay	1
as	1
a	1
lark,	1
And	1
will	1
talk	1
in	1
contemptuous	1
tones	1
of	1
the	1
Shark,	1
But,	1
when	1
the	1
tide	1
rises	1
and	1
sharks	1
are	1
around,	1
His	1
voice	1
has	1
a	1
timid	1
and	1
tremulous	1
sound.]	1
'That's	1
different	1
from	1
what	1
I	1
used	1
to	1
say	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
child,'	1
said	1
the	1
Gryphon.	1
'Well,	1
I	1
never	1
heard	1
it	1
before,'	1
said	1
the	1
Mock	1
Turtle;	1
'but	1
it	1
sounds	1
uncommon	1
nonsense.'	1
Alice	1
said	1
nothing;	1
she	1
had	1
sat	1
down	1
with	1
her	1
face	1
in	1
her	1
hands,	1
wondering	1
if	1
anything	1
would	1
EVER	1
happen	1
in	1
a	1
natural	1
way	1
again.	1
'I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
have	1
it	1
explained,'	1
said	1
the	1
Mock	1
Turtle.	1
'She	1
can't	1
explain	1
it,'	1
said	1
the	1
Gryphon	1
hastily.	1
'Go	1
on	1
with	1
the	1
next	1
verse.'	1
'But	1
about	1
his	1
toes?'	1
the	1
Mock	1
Turtle	1
persisted.	1
'How	1
COULD	1
he	1
turn	1
them	1
out	1
with	1
his	1
nose,	1
you	1
know?'	1
'It's	1
the	1
first	1
position	1
in	1
dancing.'	1
Alice	1
said;	1
but	1
was	1
dreadfully	1
puzzled	1
by	1
the	1
whole	1
thing,	1
and	1
longed	1
to	1
change	1
the	1
subject.	1
'Go	1
on	1
with	1
the	1
next	1
verse,'	1
the	1
Gryphon	1
repeated	1
impatiently:	1
'it	1
begins	1
"I	1
passed	1
by	1
his	1
garden."'	1
Alice	1
did	1
not	1
dare	1
to	1
disobey,	1
though	1
she	1
felt	1
sure	1
it	1
would	1
all	1
come	1
wrong,	1
and	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
in	1
a	1
trembling	1
voice:--	1
'I	1
passed	1
by	1
his	1
garden,	1
and	1
marked,	1
with	1
one	1
eye,	1
How	1
the	1
Owl	1
and	1
the	1
Panther	1
were	1
sharing	1
a	1
pie--'	1
[later	1
editions	1
continued	1
as	1
follows	1
The	1
Panther	1
took	1
pie-crust,	1
and	1
gravy,	1
and	1
meat,	1
While	1
the	1
Owl	1
had	1
the	1
dish	1
as	1
its	1
share	1
of	1
the	1
treat.	1
When	1
the	1
pie	1
was	1
all	1
finished,	1
the	1
Owl,	1
as	1
a	1
boon,	1
Was	1
kindly	1
permitted	1
to	1
pocket	1
the	1
spoon:	1
While	1
the	1
Panther	1
received	1
knife	1
and	1
fork	1
with	1
a	1
growl,	1
And	1
concluded	1
the	1

'What	1
IS	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
repeating	1
all	1
that	1
stuff,'	1
the	1
Mock	1
Turtle	1
interrupted,	1
'if	1
you	1
don't	1
explain	1
it	1
as	1
you	1
go	1
on?	1
It's	1
by	1
far	1
the	1
most	1
confusing	1
thing	1
I	1
ever	1
heard!'	1
'Yes,	1
I	1
think	1
you'd	1
better	1
leave	1
off,'	1
said	1
the	1
Gryphon:	1
and	1
Alice	1
was	1
only	1
too	1
glad	1
to	1
do	1
so.	1
'Shall	1
we	1
try	1
another	1
figure	1
of	1
the	1
Lobster	1
Quadrille?'	1
the	1
Gryphon	1
went	1
on.	1
'Or	1
would	1
you	1
like	1
the	1
Mock	1
Turtle	1
to	1
sing	1
you	1
a	1
song?'	1
'Oh,	1
a	1
song,	1
please,	1
if	1
the	1
Mock	1
Turtle	1
would	1
be	1
so	1
kind,'	1
Alice	1
replied,	1
so	1
eagerly	1
that	1
the	1
Gryphon	1
said,	1
in	1
a	1
rather	1
offended	1
tone,	1
'Hm!	1
No	1
accounting	1
for	1
tastes!	1
Sing	1
her	1
"Turtle	1
Soup,"	1
will	1
you,	1
old	1
fellow?'	1
The	1
Mock	1
Turtle	1
sighed	1
deeply,	1
and	1
began,	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
sometimes	1
choked	1
with	1
sobs,	1
to	1
sing	1
this:--	1
'Beautiful	1
Soup,	1
so	1
rich	1
and	1
green,	1
Waiting	1
in	1
a	1
hot	1
tureen!	1
Who	1
for	1

would	1
not	1
stoop?	1

'Chorus	1
again!'	1
cried	1
the	1
Gryphon,	1
and	1
the	1
Mock	1
Turtle	1
had	1
just	1
begun	1
to	1
repeat	1
it,	1
when	1
a	1
cry	1
of	1
'The	1
trial's	1
beginning!'	1
was	1
heard	1
in	1
the	1
distance.	1
'Come	1
on!'	1
cried	1
the	1
Gryphon,	1
and,	1
taking	1
Alice	1
by	1
the	1
hand,	1
it	1
hurried	1
off,	1
without	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
song.	1
'What	1
trial	1
is	1
it?'	1
Alice	1
panted	1
as	1
she	1
ran;	1
but	1
the	1
Gryphon	1
only	1
answered	1
'Come	1
on!'	1
and	1
ran	1
the	1
faster,	1
while	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
faintly	1
came,	1
carried	1
on	1
the	1
breeze	1
that	1
followed	1
them,	1
the	1
melancholy	1
words:--	1
'Soo--oop	1
of	1
the	1
e--e--evening,	1
Beautiful,	1
beautiful	1
Soup!'	1
CHAPTER	1
XI.	1
Who	1
Stole	1
the	1
Tarts?	1
The	1
King	1
and	1
Queen	1
of	1
Hearts	1
were	1
seated	1
on	1
their	1
throne	1
when	1
they	1
arrived,	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
crowd	1
assembled	1
about	1
them--all	1
sorts	1
of	1
little	1
birds	1
and	1
beasts,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
whole	1
pack	1
of	1
cards:	1
the	1
Knave	1
was	1
standing	1
before	1
them,	1
in	1
chains,	1
with	1
a	1
soldier	1
on	1
each	1
side	1
to	1
guard	1
him;	1
and	1
near	1
the	1
King	1
was	1
the	1
White	1
Rabbit,	1
with	1
a	1
trumpet	1
in	1
one	1
hand,	1
and	1
a	1
scroll	1
of	1
parchment	1
in	1
the	1
other.	1
In	1
the	1
very	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
court	1
was	1
a	1
table,	1
with	1
a	1
large	1
dish	1
of	1
tarts	1
upon	1
it:	1
they	1
looked	1
so	1
good,	1
that	1
it	1
made	1
Alice	1
quite	1
hungry	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
them--'I	1
wish	1
they'd	1
get	1
the	1
trial	1
done,'	1
she	1
thought,	1
'and	1
hand	1
round	1
the	1
refreshments!'	1
But	1
there	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
no	1
chance	1
of	1
this,	1
so	1
she	1
began	1
looking	1
at	1
everything	1
about	1
her,	1
to	1
pass	1
away	1
the	1
time.	1
Alice	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
in	1
a	1
court	1
of	1
justice	1
before,	1
but	1
she	1
had	1
read	1
about	1
them	1
in	1
books,	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
quite	1
pleased	1
to	1
find	1
that	1
she	1
knew	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
nearly	1
everything	1
there.	1
'That's	1
the	1
judge,'	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself,	1
'because	1
of	1
his	1
great	1
wig.'	1
The	1
judge,	1
by	1
the	1
way,	1
was	1
the	1
King;	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
wore	1
his	1
crown	1
over	1
the	1
wig,	1
(look	1
at	1
the	1
frontispiece	1
if	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
see	1
how	1
he	1
did	1
it,)	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
look	1
at	1
all	1
comfortable,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
certainly	1
not	1
becoming.	1
'And	1
that's	1
the	1
jury-box,'	1
thought	1
Alice,	1
'and	1
those	1
twelve	1
creatures,'	1
(she	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
say	1
'creatures,'	1
you	1
see,	1
because	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
were	1
animals,	1
and	1
some	1
were	1
birds,)	1
'I	1
suppose	1
they	1
are	1
the	1
jurors.'	1
She	1
said	1
this	1
last	1
word	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
times	1
over	1
to	1
herself,	1
being	1
rather	1
proud	1
of	1
it:	1
for	1
she	1
thought,	1
and	1
rightly	1
too,	1
that	1
very	1
few	1
little	1
girls	1
of	1
her	1
age	1
knew	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
it	1
at	1
all.	1
However,	1
'jury-men'	1
would	1
have	1
done	1
just	1
as	1
well.	1
The	1
twelve	1
jurors	1
were	1
all	1
writing	1
very	1
busily	1
on	1
slates.	1
'What	1
are	1
they	1
doing?'	1
Alice	1
whispered	1
to	1
the	1
Gryphon.	1
'They	1
can't	1
have	1
anything	1
to	1
put	1
down	1
yet,	1
before	1
the	1
trial's	1
begun.'	1
'They're	1
putting	1
down	1
their	1
names,'	1
the	1
Gryphon	1
whispered	1
in	1
reply,	1
'for	1
fear	1
they	1
should	1
forget	1
them	1
before	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
trial.'	1
'Stupid	1
things!'	1
Alice	1
began	1
in	1
a	1
loud,	1
indignant	1
voice,	1
but	1
she	1
stopped	1
hastily,	1
for	1
the	1
White	1
Rabbit	1
cried	1
out,	1
'Silence	1
in	1
the	1
court!'	1
and	1
the	1
King	1
put	1
on	1
his	1
spectacles	1
and	1
looked	1
anxiously	1
round,	1
to	1
make	1
out	1
who	1
was	1
talking.	1
Alice	1
could	1
see,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
were	1
looking	1
over	1
their	1
shoulders,	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
jurors	1
were	1
writing	1
down	1
'stupid	1
things!'	1
on	1
their	1
slates,	1
and	1
she	1
could	1
even	1
make	1
out	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
didn't	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
spell	1
'stupid,'	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
ask	1
his	1
neighbour	1
to	1
tell	1
him.	1
'A	1
nice	1
muddle	1
their	1
slates'll	1
be	1
in	1
before	1
the	1
trial's	1
over!'	1
thought	1
Alice.	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
jurors	1
had	1
a	1
pencil	1
that	1
squeaked.	1
This	1
of	1
course,	1
Alice	1
could	1
not	1
stand,	1
and	1
she	1
went	1
round	1
the	1
court	1
and	1
got	1
behind	1
him,	1
and	1
very	1
soon	1
found	1
an	1
opportunity	1
of	1
taking	1
it	1
away.	1
She	1
did	1
it	1
so	1
quickly	1
that	1
the	1
poor	1
little	1
juror	1
(it	1
was	1
Bill,	1
the	1
Lizard)	1
could	1
not	1
make	1
out	1
at	1
all	1
what	1
had	1
become	1
of	1
it;	1
so,	1
after	1
hunting	1
all	1
about	1
for	1
it,	1
he	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
write	1
with	1
one	1
finger	1
for	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
day;	1
and	1
this	1
was	1
of	1
very	1
little	1
use,	1
as	1
it	1
left	1
no	1
mark	1
on	1
the	1
slate.	1
'Herald,	1
read	1
the	1
accusation!'	1
said	1
the	1
King.	1
On	1
this	1
the	1
White	1
Rabbit	1
blew	1
three	1
blasts	1
on	1
the	1
trumpet,	1
and	1
then	1
unrolled	1
the	1
parchment	1
scroll,	1
and	1
read	1
as	1
follows:--	1
'The	1
Queen	1
of	1
Hearts,	1
she	1
made	1
some	1
tarts,	1
All	1
on	1
a	1
summer	1
day:	1
The	1
Knave	1
of	1
Hearts,	1
he	1
stole	1
those	1
tarts,	1
And	1
took	1
them	1
quite	1
away!'	1
'Consider	1
your	1
verdict,'	1
the	1
King	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
jury.	1
'Not	1
yet,	1
not	1
yet!'	1
the	1
Rabbit	1
hastily	1
interrupted.	1
'There's	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
to	1
come	1
before	1
that!'	1
'Call	1
the	1
first	1
witness,'	1
said	1
the	1
King;	1
and	1
the	1
White	1
Rabbit	1
blew	1
three	1
blasts	1
on	1
the	1
trumpet,	1
and	1
called	1
out,	1
'First	1
witness!'	1
The	1
first	1
witness	1
was	1
the	1
Hatter.	1
He	1
came	1
in	1
with	1
a	1
teacup	1
in	1
one	1
hand	1
and	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
bread-and-butter	1
in	1
the	1
other.	1
'I	1
beg	1
pardon,	1
your	1
Majesty,'	1
he	1
began,	1
'for	1
bringing	1
these	1
in:	1
but	1
I	1
hadn't	1
quite	1
finished	1
my	1
tea	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
sent	1
for.'	1
'You	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
finished,'	1
said	1
the	1
King.	1
'When	1
did	1
you	1
begin?'	1
The	1
Hatter	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
March	1
Hare,	1
who	1
had	1
followed	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
court,	1
arm-in-arm	1
with	1
the	1
Dormouse.	1
'Fourteenth	1
of	1
March,	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
was,'	1
he	1
said.	1
'Fifteenth,'	1
said	1
the	1
March	1
Hare.	1
'Sixteenth,'	1
added	1
the	1
Dormouse.	1
'Write	1
that	1
down,'	1
the	1
King	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
jury,	1
and	1
the	1
jury	1
eagerly	1
wrote	1
down	1
all	1
three	1
dates	1
on	1
their	1
slates,	1
and	1
then	1
added	1
them	1
up,	1
and	1
reduced	1
the	1
answer	1
to	1
shillings	1
and	1
pence.	1
'Take	1
off	1
your	1
hat,'	1
the	1
King	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
Hatter.	1
'It	1
isn't	1
mine,'	1
said	1
the	1
Hatter.	1
'Stolen!'	1
the	1
King	1
exclaimed,	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
jury,	1
who	1
instantly	1
made	1
a	1
memorandum	1
of	1
the	1
fact.	1
'I	1
keep	1
them	1
to	1
sell,'	1
the	1
Hatter	1
added	1
as	1
an	1
explanation;	1
'I've	1
none	1
of	1
my	1
own.	1
I'm	1
a	1
hatter.'	1
Here	1
the	1
Queen	1
put	1
on	1
her	1
spectacles,	1
and	1
began	1
staring	1
at	1
the	1
Hatter,	1
who	1
turned	1
pale	1
and	1
fidgeted.	1
'Give	1
your	1
evidence,'	1
said	1
the	1
King;	1
'and	1
don't	1
be	1
nervous,	1
or	1
I'll	1
have	1
you	1
executed	1
on	1
the	1
spot.'	1
This	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
encourage	1
the	1
witness	1
at	1
all:	1
he	1
kept	1
shifting	1
from	1
one	1
foot	1
to	1
the	1
other,	1
looking	1
uneasily	1
at	1
the	1
Queen,	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
confusion	1
he	1
bit	1
a	1
large	1
piece	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
teacup	1
instead	1
of	1
the	1
bread-and-butter.	1
Just	1
at	1
this	1
moment	1
Alice	1
felt	1
a	1
very	1
curious	1
sensation,	1
which	1
puzzled	1
her	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
until	1
she	1
made	1
out	1
what	1
it	1
was:	1
she	1
was	1
beginning	1
to	1
grow	1
larger	1
again,	1
and	1
she	1
thought	1
at	1
first	1
she	1
would	1
get	1
up	1
and	1
leave	1
the	1
court;	1
but	1
on	1
second	1
thoughts	1
she	1
decided	1
to	1
remain	1
where	1
she	1
was	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
there	1
was	1
room	1
for	1
her.	1
'I	1
wish	1
you	1
wouldn't	1
squeeze	1
so.'	1
said	1
the	1
Dormouse,	1
who	1
was	1
sitting	1
next	1
to	1
her.	1
'I	1
can	1
hardly	1
breathe.'	1
'I	1
can't	1
help	1
it,'	1
said	1
Alice	1
very	1
meekly:	1
'I'm	1
growing.'	1
'You've	1
no	1
right	1
to	1
grow	1
here,'	1
said	1
the	1
Dormouse.	1
'Don't	1
talk	1
nonsense,'	1
said	1
Alice	1
more	1
boldly:	1
'you	1
know	1
you're	1
growing	1
too.'	1
'Yes,	1
but	1
I	1
grow	1
at	1
a	1
reasonable	1
pace,'	1
said	1
the	1
Dormouse:	1
'not	1
in	1
that	1
ridiculous	1
fashion.'	1
And	1
he	1
got	1
up	1
very	1
sulkily	1
and	1
crossed	1
over	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
court.	1
All	1
this	1
time	1
the	1
Queen	1
had	1
never	1
left	1
off	1
staring	1
at	1
the	1
Hatter,	1
and,	1
just	1
as	1
the	1
Dormouse	1
crossed	1
the	1
court,	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
officers	1
of	1
the	1
court,	1
'Bring	1
me	1
the	1
list	1
of	1
the	1
singers	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
concert!'	1
on	1
which	1
the	1
wretched	1
Hatter	1
trembled	1
so,	1
that	1
he	1
shook	1
both	1
his	1
shoes	1
off.	1
'Give	1
your	1
evidence,'	1
the	1
King	1
repeated	1
angrily,	1
'or	1
I'll	1
have	1
you	1
executed,	1
whether	1
you're	1
nervous	1
or	1
not.'	1
'I'm	1
a	1
poor	1
man,	1
your	1
Majesty,'	1
the	1
Hatter	1
began,	1
in	1
a	1
trembling	1
voice,	1
'--and	1
I	1
hadn't	1
begun	1
my	1
tea--not	1
above	1
a	1
week	1
or	1
so--and	1
what	1
with	1
the	1
bread-and-butter	1
getting	1
so	1
thin--and	1
the	1
twinkling	1
of	1
the	1
tea--'	1
'The	1
twinkling	1
of	1
the	1
what?'	1
said	1
the	1
King.	1
'It	1
began	1
with	1
the	1
tea,'	1
the	1
Hatter	1
replied.	1
'Of	1
course	1
twinkling	1
begins	1
with	1
a	1
T!'	1
said	1
the	1
King	1
sharply.	1
'Do	1
you	1
take	1
me	1
for	1
a	1
dunce?	1
Go	1
on!'	1
'I'm	1
a	1
poor	1
man,'	1
the	1
Hatter	1
went	1
on,	1
'and	1
most	1
things	1
twinkled	1
after	1
that--only	1
the	1
March	1
Hare	1
said--'	1
'I	1
didn't!'	1
the	1
March	1
Hare	1
interrupted	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
hurry.	1
'You	1
did!'	1
said	1
the	1
Hatter.	1
'I	1
deny	1
it!'	1
said	1
the	1
March	1
Hare.	1
'He	1
denies	1
it,'	1
said	1
the	1
King:	1
'leave	1
out	1
that	1
part.'	1
'Well,	1
at	1
any	1
rate,	1
the	1
Dormouse	1
said--'	1
the	1
Hatter	1
went	1
on,	1
looking	1
anxiously	1
round	1
to	1
see	1
if	1
he	1
would	1
deny	1
it	1
too:	1
but	1
the	1
Dormouse	1
denied	1
nothing,	1
being	1
fast	1
asleep.	1
'After	1
that,'	1
continued	1
the	1
Hatter,	1
'I	1
cut	1
some	1
more	1
bread-and-butter--'	1
'But	1
what	1
did	1
the	1
Dormouse	1
say?'	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
jury	1
asked.	1
'That	1
I	1
can't	1
remember,'	1
said	1
the	1
Hatter.	1
'You	1
MUST	1
remember,'	1
remarked	1
the	1
King,	1
'or	1
I'll	1
have	1
you	1
executed.'	1
The	1
miserable	1
Hatter	1
dropped	1
his	1
teacup	1
and	1
bread-and-butter,	1
and	1
went	1
down	1
on	1
one	1
knee.	1
'I'm	1
a	1
poor	1
man,	1
your	1
Majesty,'	1
he	1
began.	1
'You're	1
a	1
very	1
poor	1
speaker,'	1
said	1
the	1
King.	1
Here	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
guinea-pigs	1
cheered,	1
and	1
was	1
immediately	1
suppressed	1
by	1
the	1
officers	1
of	1
the	1
court.	1
(As	1
that	1
is	1
rather	1
a	1
hard	1
word,	1
I	1
will	1
just	1
explain	1
to	1
you	1
how	1
it	1
was	1
done.	1
They	1
had	1
a	1
large	1
canvas	1
bag,	1
which	1
tied	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
mouth	1
with	1
strings:	1
into	1
this	1
they	1
slipped	1
the	1
guinea-pig,	1
head	1
first,	1
and	1
then	1
sat	1
upon	1
it.)	1
'I'm	1
glad	1
I've	1
seen	1
that	1
done,'	1
thought	1
Alice.	1
'I've	1
so	1
often	1
read	1
in	1
the	1
newspapers,	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
trials,	1
"There	1
was	1
some	1
attempts	1
at	1
applause,	1
which	1
was	1
immediately	1
suppressed	1
by	1
the	1
officers	1
of	1
the	1
court,"	1
and	1
I	1
never	1
understood	1
what	1
it	1
meant	1
till	1
now.'	1
'If	1
that's	1
all	1
you	1
know	1
about	1
it,	1
you	1
may	1
stand	1
down,'	1
continued	1
the	1
King.	1
'I	1
can't	1
go	1
no	1
lower,'	1
said	1
the	1
Hatter:	1
'I'm	1
on	1
the	1
floor,	1
as	1
it	1
is.'	1
'Then	1
you	1
may	1
SIT	1
down,'	1
the	1
King	1
replied.	1
Here	1
the	1
other	1
guinea-pig	1
cheered,	1
and	1
was	1
suppressed.	1
'Come,	1
that	1
finished	1
the	1
guinea-pigs!'	1
thought	1
Alice.	1
'Now	1
we	1
shall	1
get	1
on	1
better.'	1
'I'd	1
rather	1
finish	1
my	1
tea,'	1
said	1
the	1
Hatter,	1
with	1
an	1
anxious	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
Queen,	1
who	1
was	1
reading	1
the	1
list	1
of	1
singers.	1
'You	1
may	1
go,'	1
said	1
the	1
King,	1
and	1
the	1
Hatter	1
hurriedly	1
left	1
the	1
court,	1
without	1
even	1
waiting	1
to	1
put	1
his	1
shoes	1
on.	1
'--and	1
just	1
take	1
his	1
head	1
off	1
outside,'	1
the	1
Queen	1
added	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
officers:	1
but	1
the	1
Hatter	1
was	1
out	1
of	1
sight	1
before	1
the	1
officer	1
could	1
get	1
to	1
the	1
door.	1
'Call	1
the	1
next	1
witness!'	1
said	1
the	1
King.	1
The	1
next	1
witness	1
was	1
the	1
Duchess's	1
cook.	1
She	1
carried	1
the	1
pepper-box	1
in	1
her	1
hand,	1
and	1
Alice	1
guessed	1
who	1
it	1
was,	1
even	1
before	1
she	1
got	1
into	1
the	1
court,	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
the	1
people	1
near	1
the	1
door	1
began	1
sneezing	1
all	1
at	1
once.	1
'Give	1
your	1
evidence,'	1
said	1
the	1
King.	1
'Shan't,'	1
said	1
the	1
cook.	1
The	1
King	1
looked	1
anxiously	1
at	1
the	1
White	1
Rabbit,	1
who	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice,	1
'Your	1
Majesty	1
must	1
cross-examine	1
THIS	1
witness.'	1
'Well,	1
if	1
I	1
must,	1
I	1
must,'	1
the	1
King	1
said,	1
with	1
a	1
melancholy	1
air,	1
and,	1
after	1
folding	1
his	1
arms	1
and	1
frowning	1
at	1
the	1
cook	1
till	1
his	1
eyes	1
were	1
nearly	1
out	1
of	1
sight,	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
deep	1
voice,	1
'What	1
are	1
tarts	1
made	1
of?'	1
'Pepper,	1
mostly,'	1
said	1
the	1
cook.	1
'Treacle,'	1
said	1
a	1
sleepy	1
voice	1
behind	1
her.	1
'Collar	1
that	1
Dormouse,'	1
the	1
Queen	1
shrieked	1
out.	1
'Behead	1
that	1
Dormouse!	1
Turn	1
that	1
Dormouse	1
out	1
of	1
court!	1
Suppress	1
him!	1
Pinch	1
him!	1
Off	1
with	1
his	1
whiskers!'	1
For	1
some	1
minutes	1
the	1
whole	1
court	1
was	1
in	1
confusion,	1
getting	1
the	1
Dormouse	1
turned	1
out,	1
and,	1
by	1
the	1
time	1
they	1
had	1
settled	1
down	1
again,	1
the	1
cook	1
had	1
disappeared.	1
'Never	1
mind!'	1
said	1
the	1
King,	1
with	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
great	1
relief.	1
'Call	1
the	1
next	1
witness.'	1
And	1
he	1
added	1
in	1
an	1
undertone	1
to	1
the	1
Queen,	1
'Really,	1
my	1
dear,	1
YOU	1
must	1
cross-examine	1
the	1
next	1
witness.	1
It	1
quite	1
makes	1
my	1
forehead	1
ache!'	1
Alice	1
watched	1
the	1
White	1
Rabbit	1
as	1
he	1
fumbled	1
over	1
the	1
list,	1
feeling	1
very	1
curious	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
the	1
next	1
witness	1
would	1
be	1
like,	1
'--for	1
they	1
haven't	1
got	1
much	1
evidence	1
YET,'	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself.	1
Imagine	1
her	1
surprise,	1
when	1
the	1
White	1
Rabbit	1
read	1
out,	1
at	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
his	1
shrill	1
little	1
voice,	1
the	1
name	1
'Alice!'	1
CHAPTER	1
XII	1
Alice's	1
Evidence	1
'Here!'	1
cried	1
Alice,	1
quite	1
forgetting	1
in	1
the	1
flurry	1
of	1
the	1
moment	1
how	1
large	1
she	1
had	1
grown	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
few	1
minutes,	1
and	1
she	1
jumped	1
up	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
hurry	1
that	1
she	1
tipped	1
over	1
the	1
jury-box	1
with	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
her	1
skirt,	1
upsetting	1
all	1
the	1
jurymen	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
the	1
crowd	1
below,	1
and	1
there	1
they	1
lay	1
sprawling	1
about,	1
reminding	1
her	1
very	1
much	1
of	1
a	1
globe	1
of	1
goldfish	1
she	1
had	1
accidentally	1
upset	1
the	1
week	1
before.	1
'Oh,	1
I	1
BEG	1
your	1
pardon!'	1
she	1
exclaimed	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
of	1
great	1
dismay,	1
and	1
began	1
picking	1
them	1
up	1
again	1
as	1
quickly	1
as	1
she	1
could,	1
for	1
the	1
accident	1
of	1
the	1
goldfish	1
kept	1
running	1
in	1
her	1
head,	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
a	1
vague	1
sort	1
of	1
idea	1
that	1
they	1
must	1
be	1
collected	1
at	1
once	1
and	1
put	1
back	1
into	1
the	1
jury-box,	1
or	1
they	1
would	1
die.	1
'The	1
trial	1
cannot	1
proceed,'	1
said	1
the	1
King	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
grave	1
voice,	1
'until	1
all	1
the	1
jurymen	1
are	1
back	1
in	1
their	1
proper	1
places--ALL,'	1
he	1
repeated	1
with	1
great	1
emphasis,	1
looking	1
hard	1
at	1
Alice	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
do.	1
Alice	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
jury-box,	1
and	1
saw	1
that,	1
in	1
her	1
haste,	1
she	1
had	1
put	1
the	1
Lizard	1
in	1
head	1
downwards,	1
and	1
the	1
poor	1
little	1
thing	1
was	1
waving	1
its	1
tail	1
about	1
in	1
a	1
melancholy	1
way,	1
being	1
quite	1
unable	1
to	1
move.	1
She	1
soon	1
got	1
it	1
out	1
again,	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
right;	1
'not	1
that	1
it	1
signifies	1
much,'	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself;	1
'I	1
should	1
think	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
QUITE	1
as	1
much	1
use	1
in	1
the	1
trial	1
one	1
way	1
up	1
as	1
the	1
other.'	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
jury	1
had	1
a	1
little	1
recovered	1
from	1
the	1
shock	1
of	1
being	1
upset,	1
and	1
their	1
slates	1
and	1
pencils	1
had	1
been	1
found	1
and	1
handed	1
back	1
to	1
them,	1
they	1
set	1
to	1
work	1
very	1
diligently	1
to	1
write	1
out	1
a	1
history	1
of	1
the	1
accident,	1
all	1
except	1
the	1
Lizard,	1
who	1
seemed	1
too	1
much	1
overcome	1
to	1
do	1
anything	1
but	1
sit	1
with	1
its	1
mouth	1
open,	1
gazing	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
roof	1
of	1
the	1
court.	1
'What	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
about	1
this	1
business?'	1
the	1
King	1
said	1
to	1
Alice.	1
'Nothing,'	1
said	1
Alice.	1
'Nothing	1
WHATEVER?'	1
persisted	1
the	1
King.	1
'Nothing	1
whatever,'	1
said	1
Alice.	1
'That's	1
very	1
important,'	1
the	1
King	1
said,	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
jury.	1
They	1
were	1
just	1
beginning	1
to	1
write	1
this	1
down	1
on	1
their	1
slates,	1
when	1
the	1
White	1
Rabbit	1
interrupted:	1
'UNimportant,	1
your	1
Majesty	1
means,	1
of	1
course,'	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
respectful	1
tone,	1
but	1
frowning	1
and	1
making	1
faces	1
at	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
spoke.	1
'UNimportant,	1
of	1
course,	1
I	1
meant,'	1
the	1
King	1
hastily	1
said,	1
and	1
went	1
on	1
to	1
himself	1
in	1
an	1
undertone,	1
'important--unimportant--unimportant--important--'	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
trying	1
which	1
word	1
sounded	1
best.	1
Some	1
of	1
the	1
jury	1
wrote	1
it	1
down	1
'important,'	1
and	1
some	1
'unimportant.'	1
Alice	1
could	1
see	1
this,	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
near	1
enough	1
to	1
look	1
over	1
their	1
slates;	1
'but	1
it	1
doesn't	1
matter	1
a	1
bit,'	1
she	1
thought	1
to	1
herself.	1
At	1
this	1
moment	1
the	1
King,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
busily	1
writing	1
in	1
his	1
note-book,	1
cackled	1
out	1
'Silence!'	1
and	1
read	1
out	1
from	1
his	1
book,	1
'Rule	1
Forty-two.	1
ALL	1
PERSONS	1
MORE	1
THAN	1
A	1
MILE	1
HIGH	1
TO	1
LEAVE	1
THE	1
COURT.'	1
Everybody	1
looked	1
at	1
Alice.	1
'I'M	1
not	1
a	1
mile	1
high,'	1
said	1
Alice.	1
'You	1
are,'	1
said	1
the	1
King.	1
'Nearly	1
two	1
miles	1
high,'	1
added	1
the	1
Queen.	1
'Well,	1
I	1
shan't	1
go,	1
at	1
any	1
rate,'	1
said	1
Alice:	1
'besides,	1
that's	1
not	1
a	1
regular	1
rule:	1
you	1
invented	1
it	1
just	1
now.'	1
'It's	1
the	1
oldest	1
rule	1
in	1
the	1
book,'	1
said	1
the	1
King.	1
'Then	1
it	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
Number	1
One,'	1
said	1
Alice.	1
The	1
King	1
turned	1
pale,	1
and	1
shut	1
his	1
note-book	1
hastily.	1
'Consider	1
your	1
verdict,'	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
jury,	1
in	1
a	1
low,	1
trembling	1
voice.	1
'There's	1
more	1
evidence	1
to	1
come	1
yet,	1
please	1
your	1
Majesty,'	1
said	1
the	1
White	1
Rabbit,	1
jumping	1
up	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
hurry;	1
'this	1
paper	1
has	1
just	1
been	1
picked	1
up.'	1
'What's	1
in	1
it?'	1
said	1
the	1
Queen.	1
'I	1
haven't	1
opened	1
it	1
yet,'	1
said	1
the	1
White	1
Rabbit,	1
'but	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
letter,	1
written	1
by	1
the	1
prisoner	1
to--to	1
somebody.'	1
'It	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
that,'	1
said	1
the	1
King,	1
'unless	1
it	1
was	1
written	1
to	1
nobody,	1
which	1
isn't	1
usual,	1
you	1
know.'	1
'Who	1
is	1
it	1
directed	1
to?'	1
said	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
jurymen.	1
'It	1
isn't	1
directed	1
at	1
all,'	1
said	1
the	1
White	1
Rabbit;	1
'in	1
fact,	1
there's	1
nothing	1
written	1
on	1
the	1
OUTSIDE.'	1
He	1
unfolded	1
the	1
paper	1
as	1
he	1
spoke,	1
and	1
added	1
'It	1
isn't	1
a	1
letter,	1
after	1
all:	1
it's	1
a	1
set	1
of	1
verses.'	1
'Are	1
they	1
in	1
the	1
prisoner's	1
handwriting?'	1
asked	1
another	1
of	1
the	1
jurymen.	1
'No,	1
they're	1
not,'	1
said	1
the	1
White	1
Rabbit,	1
'and	1
that's	1
the	1
queerest	1
thing	1
about	1
it.'	1
(The	1
jury	1
all	1
looked	1
puzzled.)	1
'He	1
must	1
have	1
imitated	1
somebody	1
else's	1
hand,'	1
said	1
the	1
King.	1
(The	1
jury	1
all	1
brightened	1
up	1
again.)	1
'Please	1
your	1
Majesty,'	1
said	1
the	1
Knave,	1
'I	1
didn't	1
write	1
it,	1
and	1
they	1
can't	1
prove	1
I	1
did:	1
there's	1
no	1
name	1
signed	1
at	1
the	1
end.'	1
'If	1
you	1
didn't	1
sign	1
it,'	1
said	1
the	1
King,	1
'that	1
only	1
makes	1
the	1
matter	1
worse.	1
You	1
MUST	1
have	1
meant	1
some	1
mischief,	1
or	1
else	1
you'd	1
have	1
signed	1
your	1
name	1
like	1
an	1
honest	1
man.'	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
general	1
clapping	1
of	1
hands	1
at	1
this:	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
really	1
clever	1
thing	1
the	1
King	1
had	1
said	1
that	1
day.	1
'That	1
PROVES	1
his	1
guilt,'	1
said	1
the	1
Queen.	1
'It	1
proves	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
sort!'	1
said	1
Alice.	1
'Why,	1
you	1
don't	1
even	1
know	1
what	1
they're	1
about!'	1
'Read	1
them,'	1
said	1
the	1
King.	1
The	1
White	1
Rabbit	1
put	1
on	1
his	1
spectacles.	1
'Where	1
shall	1
I	1
begin,	1
please	1
your	1
Majesty?'	1
he	1
asked.	1
'Begin	1
at	1
the	1
beginning,'	1
the	1
King	1
said	1
gravely,	1
'and	1
go	1
on	1
till	1
you	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
end:	1
then	1
stop.'	1
These	1
were	1
the	1
verses	1
the	1
White	1
Rabbit	1
read:--	1
'They	1
told	1
me	1
you	1
had	1
been	1
to	1
her,	1
And	1
mentioned	1
me	1
to	1
him:	1
She	1
gave	1
me	1
a	1
good	1
character,	1
But	1
said	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
swim.	1
He	1
sent	1
them	1
word	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
gone	1
(We	1
know	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
true):	1
If	1
she	1
should	1
push	1
the	1
matter	1
on,	1
What	1
would	1
become	1
of	1
you?	1
I	1
gave	1
her	1
one,	1
they	1
gave	1
him	1
two,	1
You	1
gave	1
us	1
three	1
or	1
more;	1
They	1
all	1
returned	1
from	1
him	1
to	1
you,	1
Though	1
they	1
were	1
mine	1
before.	1
If	1
I	1
or	1
she	1
should	1
chance	1
to	1
be	1
Involved	1
in	1
this	1
affair,	1
He	1
trusts	1
to	1
you	1
to	1
set	1
them	1
free,	1
Exactly	1
as	1
we	1
were.	1
My	1
notion	1
was	1
that	1
you	1
had	1
been	1
(Before	1
she	1
had	1
this	1
fit)	1
An	1
obstacle	1
that	1
came	1
between	1
Him,	1
and	1
ourselves,	1
and	1
it.	1
Don't	1
let	1
him	1
know	1
she	1
liked	1
them	1
best,	1
For	1
this	1
must	1
ever	1
be	1
A	1
secret,	1
kept	1
from	1
all	1
the	1
rest,	1
Between	1
yourself	1
and	1
me.'	1
'That's	1
the	1
most	1
important	1
piece	1
of	1
evidence	1
we've	1
heard	1
yet,'	1
said	1
the	1
King,	1
rubbing	1
his	1
hands;	1
'so	1
now	1
let	1
the	1
jury--'	1
'If	1
any	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
can	1
explain	1
it,'	1
said	1
Alice,	1
(she	1
had	1
grown	1
so	1
large	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
few	1
minutes	1
that	1
she	1
wasn't	1
a	1
bit	1
afraid	1
of	1
interrupting	1
him,)	1
'I'll	1
give	1
him	1
sixpence.	1
_I_	1
don't	1
believe	1
there's	1
an	1
atom	1
of	1
meaning	1
in	1
it.'	1
The	1
jury	1
all	1
wrote	1
down	1
on	1
their	1
slates,	1
'SHE	1
doesn't	1
believe	1
there's	1
an	1
atom	1
of	1
meaning	1
in	1
it,'	1
but	1
none	1
of	1
them	1
attempted	1
to	1
explain	1
the	1
paper.	1
'If	1
there's	1
no	1
meaning	1
in	1
it,'	1
said	1
the	1
King,	1
'that	1
saves	1
a	1
world	1
of	1
trouble,	1
you	1
know,	1
as	1
we	1
needn't	1
try	1
to	1
find	1
any.	1
And	1
yet	1
I	1
don't	1
know,'	1
he	1
went	1
on,	1
spreading	1
out	1
the	1
verses	1
on	1
his	1
knee,	1
and	1
looking	1
at	1
them	1
with	1
one	1
eye;	1
'I	1
seem	1
to	1
see	1
some	1
meaning	1
in	1
them,	1
after	1
all.	1
"--SAID	1
I	1
COULD	1
NOT	1
SWIM--"	1
you	1
can't	1
swim,	1
can	1
you?'	1
he	1
added,	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
Knave.	1
The	1
Knave	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
sadly.	1
'Do	1
I	1
look	1
like	1
it?'	1
he	1
said.	1
(Which	1
he	1
certainly	1
did	1
NOT,	1
being	1
made	1
entirely	1
of	1
cardboard.)	1
'All	1
right,	1
so	1
far,'	1
said	1
the	1
King,	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
muttering	1
over	1
the	1
verses	1
to	1
himself:	1
'"WE	1
KNOW	1
IT	1
TO	1
BE	1
TRUE--"	1
that's	1
the	1
jury,	1
of	1
course--"I	1
GAVE	1
HER	1
ONE,	1
THEY	1
GAVE	1
HIM	1
TWO--"	1
why,	1
that	1
must	1
be	1
what	1
he	1
did	1
with	1
the	1
tarts,	1
you	1
know--'	1
'But,	1
it	1
goes	1
on	1
"THEY	1
ALL	1
RETURNED	1
FROM	1
HIM	1
TO	1
YOU,"'	1
said	1
Alice.	1
'Why,	1
there	1
they	1
are!'	1
said	1
the	1
King	1
triumphantly,	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
tarts	1
on	1
the	1
table.	1
'Nothing	1
can	1
be	1
clearer	1
than	1
THAT.	1
Then	1
again--"BEFORE	1
SHE	1
HAD	1
THIS	1
FIT--"	1
you	1
never	1
had	1
fits,	1
my	1
dear,	1
I	1
think?'	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
Queen.	1
'Never!'	1
said	1
the	1
Queen	1
furiously,	1
throwing	1
an	1
inkstand	1
at	1
the	1
Lizard	1
as	1
she	1
spoke.	1
(The	1
unfortunate	1
little	1
Bill	1
had	1
left	1
off	1
writing	1
on	1
his	1
slate	1
with	1
one	1
finger,	1
as	1
he	1
found	1
it	1
made	1
no	1
mark;	1
but	1
he	1
now	1
hastily	1
began	1
again,	1
using	1
the	1
ink,	1
that	1
was	1
trickling	1
down	1
his	1
face,	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
it	1
lasted.)	1
'Then	1
the	1
words	1
don't	1
FIT	1
you,'	1
said	1
the	1
King,	1
looking	1
round	1
the	1
court	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
dead	1
silence.	1
'It's	1
a	1
pun!'	1
the	1
King	1
added	1
in	1
an	1
offended	1
tone,	1
and	1
everybody	1
laughed,	1
'Let	1
the	1
jury	1
consider	1
their	1
verdict,'	1
the	1
King	1
said,	1
for	1
about	1
the	1
twentieth	1
time	1
that	1
day.	1
'No,	1
no!'	1
said	1
the	1
Queen.	1
'Sentence	1
first--verdict	1
afterwards.'	1
'Stuff	1
and	1
nonsense!'	1
said	1
Alice	1
loudly.	1
'The	1
idea	1
of	1
having	1
the	1
sentence	1
first!'	1
'Hold	1
your	1
tongue!'	1
said	1
the	1
Queen,	1
turning	1
purple.	1
'I	1
won't!'	1
said	1
Alice.	1
'Off	1
with	1
her	1
head!'	1
the	1
Queen	1
shouted	1
at	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
her	1
voice.	1
Nobody	1
moved.	1
'Who	1
cares	1
for	1
you?'	1
said	1
Alice,	1
(she	1
had	1
grown	1
to	1
her	1
full	1
size	1
by	1
this	1
time.)	1
'You're	1
nothing	1
but	1
a	1
pack	1
of	1
cards!'	1
At	1
this	1
the	1
whole	1
pack	1
rose	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
air,	1
and	1
came	1
flying	1
down	1
upon	1
her:	1
she	1
gave	1
a	1
little	1
scream,	1
half	1
of	1
fright	1
and	1
half	1
of	1
anger,	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
beat	1
them	1
off,	1
and	1
found	1
herself	1
lying	1
on	1
the	1
bank,	1
with	1
her	1
head	1
in	1
the	1
lap	1
of	1
her	1
sister,	1
who	1
was	1
gently	1
brushing	1
away	1
some	1
dead	1
leaves	1
that	1
had	1
fluttered	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
trees	1
upon	1
her	1
face.	1
'Wake	1
up,	1
Alice	1
dear!'	1
said	1
her	1
sister;	1
'Why,	1
what	1
a	1
long	1
sleep	1
you've	1
had!'	1
'Oh,	1
I've	1
had	1
such	1
a	1
curious	1
dream!'	1
said	1
Alice,	1
and	1
she	1
told	1
her	1
sister,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
she	1
could	1
remember	1
them,	1
all	1
these	1
strange	1
Adventures	1
of	1
hers	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
just	1
been	1
reading	1
about;	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
finished,	1
her	1
sister	1
kissed	1
her,	1
and	1
said,	1
'It	1
WAS	1
a	1
curious	1
dream,	1
dear,	1
certainly:	1
but	1
now	1
run	1
in	1
to	1
your	1
tea;	1
it's	1
getting	1
late.'	1
So	1
Alice	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
ran	1
off,	1
thinking	1
while	1
she	1
ran,	1
as	1
well	1
she	1
might,	1
what	1
a	1
wonderful	1
dream	1
it	1
had	1
been.	1
But	1
her	1
sister	1
sat	1
still	1
just	1
as	1
she	1
left	1
her,	1
leaning	1
her	1
head	1
on	1
her	1
hand,	1
watching	1
the	1
setting	1
sun,	1
and	1
thinking	1
of	1
little	1
Alice	1
and	1
all	1
her	1
wonderful	1
Adventures,	1
till	1
she	1
too	1
began	1
dreaming	1
after	1
a	1
fashion,	1
and	1
this	1
was	1
her	1
dream:--	1
First,	1
she	1
dreamed	1
of	1
little	1
Alice	1
herself,	1
and	1
once	1
again	1
the	1
tiny	1
hands	1
were	1
clasped	1
upon	1
her	1
knee,	1
and	1
the	1
bright	1
eager	1
eyes	1
were	1
looking	1
up	1
into	1
hers--she	1
could	1
hear	1
the	1
very	1
tones	1
of	1
her	1
voice,	1
and	1
see	1
that	1
queer	1
little	1
toss	1
of	1
her	1
head	1
to	1
keep	1
back	1
the	1
wandering	1
hair	1
that	1
WOULD	1
always	1
get	1
into	1
her	1
eyes--and	1
still	1
as	1
she	1
listened,	1
or	1
seemed	1
to	1
listen,	1
the	1
whole	1
place	1
around	1
her	1
became	1
alive	1
the	1
strange	1
creatures	1
of	1
her	1
little	1
sister's	1
dream.	1
The	1
long	1
grass	1
rustled	1
at	1
her	1
feet	1
as	1
the	1
White	1
Rabbit	1
hurried	1
by--the	1
frightened	1
Mouse	1
splashed	1
his	1
way	1
through	1
the	1
neighbouring	1
pool--she	1
could	1
hear	1
the	1
rattle	1
of	1
the	1
teacups	1
as	1
the	1
March	1
Hare	1
and	1
his	1
friends	1
shared	1
their	1
never-ending	1
meal,	1
and	1
the	1
shrill	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
Queen	1
ordering	1
off	1
her	1
unfortunate	1
guests	1
to	1
execution--once	1
more	1
the	1
pig-baby	1
was	1
sneezing	1
on	1
the	1
Duchess's	1
knee,	1
while	1
plates	1
and	1
dishes	1
crashed	1
around	1
it--once	1
more	1
the	1
shriek	1
of	1
the	1
Gryphon,	1
the	1
squeaking	1
of	1
the	1
Lizard's	1
slate-pencil,	1
and	1
the	1
choking	1
of	1
the	1
suppressed	1
guinea-pigs,	1
filled	1
the	1
air,	1
mixed	1
up	1
with	1
the	1
distant	1
sobs	1
of	1
the	1
miserable	1
Mock	1
Turtle.	1
So	1
she	1
sat	1
on,	1
with	1
closed	1
eyes,	1
and	1
half	1
believed	1
herself	1
in	1
Wonderland,	1
though	1
she	1
knew	1
she	1
had	1
but	1
to	1
open	1
them	1
again,	1
and	1
all	1
would	1
change	1
to	1
dull	1
reality--the	1
grass	1
would	1
be	1
only	1
rustling	1
in	1
the	1
wind,	1
and	1
the	1
pool	1
rippling	1
to	1
the	1
waving	1
of	1
the	1
reeds--the	1
rattling	1
teacups	1
would	1
change	1
to	1
tinkling	1
sheep-bells,	1
and	1
the	1
Queen's	1
shrill	1
cries	1
to	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
shepherd	1
boy--and	1
the	1
sneeze	1
of	1
the	1
baby,	1
the	1
shriek	1
of	1
the	1
Gryphon,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
other	1
queer	1
noises,	1
would	1
change	1
(she	1
knew)	1
to	1
the	1
confused	1
clamour	1
of	1
the	1
busy	1
farm-yard--while	1
the	1
lowing	1
of	1
the	1
cattle	1
in	1
the	1
distance	1
would	1
take	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
Mock	1
Turtle's	1
heavy	1
sobs.	1
Lastly,	1
she	1
pictured	1
to	1
herself	1
how	1
this	1
same	1
little	1
sister	1
of	1
hers	1
would,	1
in	1
the	1
after-time,	1
be	1
herself	1
a	1
grown	1
woman;	1
and	1
how	1
she	1
would	1
keep,	1
through	1
all	1
her	1
riper	1
years,	1
the	1
simple	1
and	1
loving	1
heart	1
of	1
her	1
childhood:	1
and	1
how	1
she	1
would	1
gather	1
about	1
her	1
other	1
little	1
children,	1
and	1
make	1
THEIR	1
eyes	1
bright	1
and	1
eager	1
with	1
many	1
a	1
strange	1
tale,	1
perhaps	1
even	1
with	1
the	1
dream	1
of	1
Wonderland	1
of	1
long	1
ago:	1
and	1
how	1
she	1
would	1
feel	1
with	1
all	1
their	1
simple	1
sorrows,	1
and	1
find	1
a	1
pleasure	1
in	1
all	1
their	1
simple	1
joys,	1
remembering	1
her	1
own	1
child-life,	1
and	1
the	1
happy	1
summer	1
days.	1
