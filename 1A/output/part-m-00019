For	1
many	1
years,	1
children	1
growing	1
up	1
in	1
a	1
single	1
parent	1
family	1
have	1
been	1
viewed	1
as	1
different.	1
Being	1
raised	1
by	1
only	1
one	1
pare	1
nt	1
seems	1
impossible	1
to	1
many	1
yet	1
over	1
the	1
decades	1
it	1
has	1
become	1
more	1
prevalent.	1
In	1
today’s	1
society	1
many	1
children	1
have	1
grown	1
up	1
to	1
become	1
emotionally	1
stable	1
and	1
successful	1
wh	1
ether	1
they	1
had	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
parents	1
to	1
show	1
them	1
the	1
rocky	1
path	1
that	1
life	1
bestows	1
upon	1
all	1
human	1
beings.	1
The	1
problem	1
lies	1
in	1
the	1
difference	1
of	1
children	1
raised	1
by	1
single	1
parent	1
s	1
versus	1
children	1
raised	1
by	1
both	1
a	1
mother	1
and	1
a	1
father.	1
Does	1
a	1
child	1
need	1
both	1
pare	1
nts?	1
Does	1
a	1
young	1
boy	1
need	1
a	1
father	1
figure	1
around?	1
Does	1
the	1
government	1
provide	1
help	1
for	1
single	1
parents?	1
What	1
role	1
do	1
step-parents	1
and	1
step-siblings	1
play?	1
With	1
much	1
speculation,	1
this	1
topic	1
has	1
become	1
a	1
very	1
intriguing	1
argument.	1
What	1
people	1
must	1
understand	1
is	1
that	1
properly	1
raising	1
a	1
ch	1
ild	1
does	1
not	1
rely	1
on	1
the	1
structure	1
of	1
a	1
family	1
but	1
should	1
be	1
more	1
focused	1
on	1
the	1
process	1
or	1
values	1
that	1
are	1
taught	1
to	1
these	1
children	1
as	1
they	1
learn	1
to	1
matu	1
re.	1
Children	1
of	1
single	1
parents	1
can	1
be	1
just	1
as	1
progressive	1
with	1
emotional,	1
social	1
and	1
behavi	1
oral	1
skills	1
as	1
those	1
with	1
two	1
parents.	1
People	1
claim	1
that	1
the	1
only	1
way	1
for	1
children	1
to	1
gain	1
full	1
emotional	1
and	1
behavioral	1
skills	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
raised	1
by	1
both	1
a	1
mother	1
and	1
a	1
father.	1
When	1
a	1
topic	1
such	1
as	1
this	1
one	1
has	1
a	1
broad	1
amount	1
of	1
variables	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
to	1
simply	1
link	1
these	1
problems	1
to	1
only	1
having	1
one	1
parent.	1
In	1
the	1
article,	1
“Single-parent	1
families	1
cause	1
juvenile	1
crime”,	1
author	1
Robert	1
L.	1
Maginnis	1
states,	1
“Children	1
from	1
single-parent	1
families	1
are	1
more	1
likely	1
to	1
have	1
behavior	1
Polito	1
2	1
problems	1
because	1
they	1
tend	1
to	1
lack	1
economic	1
security	1
and	1
adequate	1
time	1
with	1
parents”.	1
The	1
simple	1
statement	1
that	1
raw	1
criminals	1
are	1
products	1
of	1
single-parent	1
adolescence	1
is	1
absurd.	1
What	1
this	1
writer	1
must	1
understand	1
is	1
that	1
it	1
can	1
be	1
extremely	1
difficult	1
for	1
one	1
parent	1
to	1
raise	1
a	1
child	1
by	1
themselves	1
for	1
many	1
reasons.	1
A	1
single-parent	1
must	1
work	1
full	1
time	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
afford	1
to	1
provide	1
for	1
themse	1
lves	1
and	1
their	1
child.	1
They	1
must	1
also	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
still	1
have	1
time	1
to	1
offer	1
an	1
exuberant	1
am	1
ount	1
of	1
emotional	1
time	1
for	1
the	1
well	1
being	1
of	1
their	1
child.	1
However,	1
even	1
though	1
this	1
ma	1
y	1
seem	1
impossible,	1
it	1
can	1
be	1
done.	1
As	1
this	1
subject	1
continues	1
to	1
be	1
looked	1
down	1
on	1
people	1
must	1
realize	1
that	1
single	1
parents	1
are	1
becoming	1
more	1
common	1
in	1
today’	1
s	1
world.	1
Since	1
1995	1
the	1
American	1
family	1
structure	1
for	1
children	1
ages	1
fourteen	1
to	1
eightee	1
n	1
consists	1
of	1
forty-tw	1
o	1
percent	1
living	1
in	1
a	1
first	1
marriage	1
family	1
with	1
both	1
parents,	1
tw	1
enty-two	1
percent	1
livi	1
ng	1
in	1
a	1
second	1
marriage	1
step-family,	1
twenty-one	1
percent	1
living	1
in	1
a	1
si	1
ngle	1
parent,	1
divorced	1
or	1
separated	1
family,	1
six	1
percent	1
living	1
in	1
a	1
single	1
parent	1
never	1
married	1
family	1
and	1
three	1
percent	1
living	1
in	1
a	1
single	1
parent	1
widowed	1
family.	1
This	1
is	1
an	1
extr	1
emely	1
scary	1
statistic	1
c	1
onsidering	1
that	1
fifty-	1
eight	1
percent	1
of	1
children	1
in	1
America	1
are	1
living	1
in	1
a	1
single	1
parent	1
fam	1
ily.	1
This	1
is	1
a	1
chilling	1
percentage	1
because	1
it	1
shows	1
how	1
little	1
faith	1
is	1
put	1
into	1
a	1
relationship	1
before	1
actually	1
deciding	1
to	1
have	1
children.	1
Unfortunately	1
not	1
all	1
single-parents	1
take	1
the	1
time	1
to	1
perform	1
the	1
vital	1
tasks	1
needed	1
to	1
rais	1
e	1
their	1
children.	1
Parents	1
who	1
th	1
ink	1
they	1
would	1
never	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
provide	1
emotional	1
stability	1
for	1
their	1
childre	1
n	1
by	1
themselves	1
should	1
have	1
taken	1
the	1
time	1
to	1
think	1
this	1
through	1
before	1
deciding	1
to	1
b	1
ecome	1
parents.	1
Accidents	1
may	1
happen	1
once	1
in	1
awhile	1
but	1
in	1
most	1
cases	1
adults	1
know	1
what	1
is	1
at	1
stake	1
when	1
planning	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
child.	1
Plain	1
and	1
simple,	1
if	1
you’re	1
not	1
ready,	1
than	1
don’	1
t	1
do	1
it.	1
If	1
you	1
do	1
decide	1
to	1
have	1
this	1
child	1
Polito	1
3	1
and	1
you	1
love	1
this	1
child,	1
then	1
you	1
can	1
be	1
a	1
good	1
parent.	1
There	1
are	1
many	1
ways	1
to	1
enhance	1
the	1
well	1
being	1
of	1
your	1
child	1
if	1
you	1
simply	1
apply	1
yourselves	1
as	1
parents.	1
Magginnis	1
later	1
states	1
that,	1
“Boys	1
who	1
do	1
not	1
have	1
fathers	1
as	1
male	1
role	1
models	1
suffer	1
especially”.	1
While	1
it	1
is	1
extremely	1
impor	1
tant	1
for	1
a	1
male	1
child	1
to	1
have	1
his	1
father	1
around,	1
there	1
are	1
other	1
ways	1
of	1
teaching	1
a	1
youn	1
g	1
boy	1
the	1
lessons	1
he	1
needs	1
to	1
become	1
a	1
man.	1
I	1
know	1
from	1
personal	1
experience	1
that	1
what	1
the	1
author	1
of	1
this	1
article	1
is	1
trying	1
to	1
convey	1
is	1
wrong.	1
I	1
never	1
had	1
my	1
father	1
around	1
while	1
growing	1
up	1
and	1
I	1
did	1
in	1
fact	1
have	1
many	1
positive	1
male	1
role	1
models.	1
My	1
Grandfather	1
was	1
always	1
there	1
to	1
help	1
guide	1
me	1
as	1
I	1
slowly	1
blossomed	1
into	1
a	1
young	1
man.	1
Anytime	1
my	1
mother	1
had	1
to	1
work	1
to	1
support	1
us,	1
my	1
grandparents,	1
aunt’s,	1
uncles	1
and	1
cousins	1
woul	1
d	1
step	1
up	1
and	1
provide	1
the	1
time	1
and	1
attention	1
I	1
needed.	1
Therefore,	1
I	1
had	1
the	1
best	1
support	1
group	1
I	1
could	1
have	1
had	1
as	1
a	1
young	1
man.	1
Being	1
a	1
child	1
with	1
a	1
single	1
mother	1
had	1
its	1
benefits	1
.	1
Although	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
find	1
how	1
hard	1
it	1
really	1
was	1
for	1
her	1
to	1
always	1
meet	1
the	1
needs	1
of	1
her	1
child,	1
she	1
did	1
the	1
best	1
job	1
that	1
she	1
possibly	1
could	1
and	1
gave	1
me	1
the	1
knowledge	1
that	1
I	1
need	1
ed	1
to	1
become	1
a	1
successful	1
man	1
without	1
the	1
guidance	1
of	1
my	1
father.	1
I	1
did	1
however	1
have	1
the	1
e	1
xperience	1
of	1
dealing	1
with	1
a	1
step-parent.	1
Today,	1
twenty-	1
five	1
percent	1
of	1
all	1
American	1
children	1
will	1
sp	1
end	1
at	1
least	1
some	1
time	1
of	1
their	1
growing-up	1
years	1
in	1
a	1
stepfamily.	1
This	1
seems	1
fine	1
for	1
si	1
ngle	1
parents	1
because	1
they	1
feel	1
like	1
they	1
can	1
start	1
over	1
in	1
a	1
new	1
relationshi	1
p	1
and	1
receive	1
help	1
from	1
their	1
spouse	1
both	1
emotionally	1
and	1
financially.	1
A	1
step-parent	1
can	1
cause	1
confus	1
ion	1
and	1
emotional	1
stress	1
on	1
the	1
child	1
since	1
they	1
have	1
just	1
had	1
to	1
adjust	1
to	1
only	1
one	1
pare	1
nt	1
and	1
now	1
have	1
to	1
adjust	1
to	1
a	1
new	1
parental	1
figure	1
stepping	1
into	1
the	1
family	1
ro	1
le.	1
Another	1
factor	1
of	1
bringing	1
a	1
step-parent	1
into	1
a	1
single	1
family’s	1
life	1
is	1
new	1
step-siblings	1
to	1
get	1
along	1
with.	1
It	1
might	1
not	1
be	1
justified	1
for	1
a	1
step-	1
Polito	1
4	1
parent	1
to	1
punish	1
their	1
step-child	1
like	1
they	1
would	1
their	1
own	1
flesh	1
and	1
blood.	1
As	1
long	1
as	1
both	1
parents	1
have	1
an	1
understanding	1
that	1
their	1
fa	1
mily	1
comes	1
first	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
important	1
to	1
communicate	1
between	1
themselves	1
and	1
with	1
th	1
e	1
children,	1
a	1
step-family	1
could	1
survive.	1
Children	1
who	1
are	1
raised	1
with	1
both	1
a	1
mother	1
and	1
a	1
father	1
have	1
more	1
attention	1
from	1
both	1
parents	1
therefore	1
they	1
ge	1
t	1
the	1
emotional	1
time	1
they	1
need	1
to	1
progress	1
in	1
life.	1
This	1
could	1
be	1
true	1
but	1
not	1
in	1
all	1
circumstances.	1
It	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
beneficial	1
at	1
all	1
to	1
grow	1
up	1
in	1
a	1
two	1
parent	1
family	1
who	1
did	1
nothing	1
but	1
argue	1
and	1
put	1
each-other	1
down.	1
Naturally,	1
a	1
child	1
who	1
sees	1
this	1
from	1
a	1
very	1
young	1
age	1
until	1
they	1
are	1
ready	1
to	1
be	1
out	1
on	1
their	1
own	1
would	1
only	1
follow	1
in	1
the	1
footsteps	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
ever	1
known.	1
Children	1
who	1
are	1
raised	1
by	1
one	1
parent	1
who	1
devotes	1
their	1
time	1
and	1
emotion	1
into	1
their	1
child	1
woul	1
d	1
benefit	1
much	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
child	1
who	1
has	1
both	1
parent	1
s	1
showing	1
them	1
that	1
fighting	1
and	1
arguing	1
is	1
acceptable.	1
Not	1
all	1
families	1
are	1
lucky	1
enough	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
healthy	1
structure.	1
It	1
is	1
important	1
for	1
society	1
and	1
government	1
aids	1
to	1
notice	1
these	1
st	1
ructural	1
differences	1
and	1
take	1
action.	1
There	1
should	1
be	1
government	1
funded	1
programs	1
to	1
he	1
lp	1
assist	1
single-parent	1
families	1
with	1
childcare	1
and	1
finances	1
for	1
parents	1
who	1
must	1
wo	1
rk	1
and	1
still	1
have	1
time	1
for	1
their	1
children.	1
Whether	1
it’s	1
a	1
mother	1
and	1
a	1
father,	1
a	1
single	1
mother,	1
or	1
a	1
single	1
father,	1
children	1
need	1
guidance.	1
They	1
will	1
only	1
become	1
a	1
pr	1
oduct	1
of	1
what	1
they	1
are	1
taught	1
from	1
