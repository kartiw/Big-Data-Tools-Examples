[The	1

THE	1
ORPHANS.	1
Near	1
the	1
ruins	1
of	1
the	1
castle	1
of	1
Rossmore,	1
in	1
Ireland,	1
is	1
a	1
small	1
cabin,	1
in	1
which	1
there	1
once	1
lived	1
a	1
widow	1
and	1
her	1
four	1
children.	1
As	1
long	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
work,	1
she	1
was	1
very	1
industrious,	1
and	1
was	1
accounted	1
the	1
best	1
spinner	1
in	1
the	1
parish;	1
but	1
she	1
overworked	1
herself	1
at	1
last,	1
and	1
fell	1
ill,	1
so	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
sit	1
to	1
her	1
wheel	1
as	1
she	1
used	1
to	1
do,	1
and	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
give	1
it	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
eldest	1
daughter,	1
Mary.	1
Mary	1
was	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
about	1
twelve	1
years	1
old.	1
One	1
evening	1
she	1
was	1
sitting	1
at	1
the	1
foot	1
of	1
her	1
mother's	1
bed	1
spinning,	1
and	1
her	1
little	1
brothers	1
and	1
sisters	1
were	1
gathered	1
round	1
the	1
fire	1
eating	1
their	1
potatoes	1
and	1
milk	1
for	1
supper.	1
"Bless	1
them,	1
the	1
poor	1
young	1
creatures!"	1
said	1
the	1
widow,	1
who,	1
as	1
she	1
lay	1
on	1
her	1
bed,	1
which	1
she	1
knew	1
must	1
be	1
her	1
deathbed,	1
was	1
thinking	1
of	1
what	1
would	1
become	1
of	1
her	1
children	1
after	1
she	1
was	1
gone.	1
Mary	1
stopped	1
her	1
wheel,	1
for	1
she	1
was	1
afraid	1
that	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
it	1
had	1
wakened	1
her	1
mother,	1
and	1
would	1
hinder	1
her	1
from	1
going	1
to	1
sleep	1
again.	1
"No	1
need	1
to	1
stop	1
the	1
wheel,	1
Mary,	1
dear,	1
for	1
me,"	1
said	1
her	1
mother,	1
"I	1
was	1
not	1
asleep;	1
nor	1
is	1
it	1
THAT	1
which	1
keeps	1
me	1
from	1
sleep.	1
But	1
don't	1
overwork	1
yourself,	1
Mary."	1
"Oh,	1
no	1
fear	1
of	1
that,"	1
replied	1
Mary;	1
"I'm	1
strong	1
and	1
hearty."	1
"So	1
was	1
I	1
once,"	1
said	1
her	1
mother.	1
"And	1
so	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
again,	1
I	1
hope,"	1
said	1
Mary,	1
"when	1
the	1
fine	1
weather	1
comes	1
again."	1
"The	1
fine	1
weather	1
will	1
never	1
come	1
again	1
to	1
me,"	1
said	1
her	1
mother.	1
"'Tis	1
a	1
folly,	1
Mary,	1
to	1
hope	1
for	1
that;	1
but	1
what	1
I	1
hope	1
is,	1
that	1
you'll	1
find	1
some	1
friend--some	1
help--orphans	1
as	1
you'll	1
soon	1
all	1
of	1
you	1
be.	1
And	1
one	1
thing	1
comforts	1
my	1
heart,	1
even	1
as	1
I	1
AM	1
lying	1
here,	1
that	1
not	1
a	1
soul	1
in	1
the	1
wide	1
world	1
I	1
am	1
leaving	1
has	1
to	1
complain	1
of	1
me.	1
Though	1
poor	1
I	1
have	1
lived	1
honest,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
brought	1
you	1
up	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
same,	1
Mary;	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
the	1
little	1
ones	1
will	1
take	1
after	1
you;	1
for	1
you'll	1
be	1
good	1
to	1
them--as	1
good	1
to	1
them	1
as	1
you	1
can."	1
Here	1
the	1
children,	1
who	1
had	1
finished	1
eating	1
their	1
suppers,	1
came	1
round	1
the	1
bed,	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
what	1
their	1
mother	1
was	1
saying.	1
She	1
was	1
tired	1
of	1
speaking,	1
for	1
she	1
was	1
very	1
weak;	1
but	1
she	1
took	1
their	1
little	1
hands,	1
as	1
they	1
laid	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
bed	1
and	1
joining	1
them	1
all	1
together,	1
she	1
said,	1
"Bless	1
you,	1
dears;	1
bless	1
you;	1
love	1
and	1
help	1
one	1
another	1
all	1
you	1
can.	1
Good	1
night!--	1
good-bye!"	1
Mary	1
took	1
the	1
children	1
away	1
to	1
their	1
bed,	1
for	1
she	1
saw	1
that	1
their	1
mother	1
was	1
too	1
ill	1
to	1
say	1
more;	1
but	1
Mary	1
did	1
not	1
herself	1
know	1
how	1
ill	1
she	1
was.	1
Her	1
mother	1
never	1
spoke	1
rightly	1
afterwards,	1
but	1
talked	1
in	1
a	1
confused	1
way	1
about	1
some	1
debts,	1
and	1
one	1
in	1
particular,	1
which	1
she	1
owed	1
to	1
a	1
schoolmistress	1
for	1
Mary's	1
schooling;	1
and	1
then	1
she	1
charged	1
Mary	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
pay	1
it,	1
because	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
GO	1
IN	1
with	1
it.	1
At	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
week	1
she	1
was	1
dead	1
and	1
buried,	1
and	1
the	1
orphans	1
were	1
left	1
alone	1
in	1
their	1
cabin.	1
The	1
two	1
youngest	1
girls,	1
Peggy	1
and	1
Nancy,	1
were	1
six	1
and	1
seven	1
years	1
old.	1
Edmund	1
was	1
not	1
yet	1
nine,	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
stout-grown,	1
healthy	1
boy,	1
and	1
well	1
disposed	1
to	1
work.	1
He	1
had	1
been	1
used	1
to	1
bring	1
home	1
turf	1
from	1
the	1
bog	1
on	1
his	1
back,	1
to	1
lead	1
cart-horses,	1
and	1
often	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
errands	1
for	1
gentlemen's	1
families,	1
who	1
paid	1
him	1
a	1
sixpence	1
or	1
a	1
shilling,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
distance	1
which	1
he	1
went,	1
so	1
that	1
Edmund,	1
by	1
some	1
or	1
other	1
of	1
these	1
little	1
employments,	1
was,	1
as	1
he	1
said,	1
likely	1
enough	1
to	1
earn	1
his	1
bread;	1
and	1
he	1
told	1
Mary	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
good	1
heart,	1
for	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
every	1
year	1
grow	1
able	1
to	1
do	1
more	1
and	1
more,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
never	1
forget	1
his	1
mother's	1
words	1
when	1
she	1
last	1
gave	1
him	1
her	1
blessing,	1
and	1
joined	1
their	1
hands	1
all	1
together.	1
As	1
for	1
Peggy	1
and	1
Nancy,	1
it	1
was	1
little	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
do;	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
good	1
children,	1
and	1
Mary,	1
when	1
she	1
considered	1
that	1
so	1
much	1
depended	1
upon	1
her,	1
was	1
resolved	1
to	1
exert	1
herself	1
to	1
the	1
utmost.	1
Her	1
first	1
care	1
was	1
to	1
pay	1
those	1
debts	1
which	1
her	1
mother	1
had	1
mentioned	1
to	1
her,	1
for	1
which	1
she	1
left	1
money	1
done	1
up	1
carefully	1
in	1
separate	1
papers.	1
When	1
all	1
these	1
were	1
paid	1
away,	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
enough	1
left	1
to	1
pay	1
both	1
the	1
rent	1
of	1
the	1
cabin	1
and	1
a	1
year's	1
schooling	1
for	1
herself	1
and	1
sisters	1
which	1
was	1
due	1
to	1
the	1
schoolmistress	1
in	1
a	1
neighbouring	1
village.	1
Mary	1
was	1
in	1
hopes	1
that	1
the	1
rent	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
called	1
for	1
immediately,	1
but	1
in	1
this	1
she	1
was	1
disappointed.	1
Mr.	1
Harvey,	1
the	1
gentleman	1
on	1
whose	1
estate	1
she	1
lived,	1
was	1
in	1
England,	1
and,	1
in	1
his	1
absence,	1
all	1
was	1
managed	1
by	1
a	1
Mr.	1
Hopkins,	1
an	1
agent,	1
who	1
was	1
a	1
HARD	1
MAN.*	1
The	1
driver	1
came	1
to	1
Mary	1
about	1
a	1
week	1
after	1
her	1
mother's	1
death,	1
and	1
told	1
her	1
that	1
the	1
rent	1
must	1
be	1
brought	1
in	1
the	1
next	1
day,	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
must	1
leave	1
the	1
cabin,	1
for	1
a	1
new	1
tenant	1
was	1
coming	1
into	1
it;	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
too	1
young	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
house	1
to	1
herself,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
only	1
thing	1
she	1
had	1
to	1
do	1
was	1
to	1
get	1
some	1
neighbour	1
to	1
take	1
her	1
and	1
her	1
brother	1
and	1
her	1
sisters	1
in	1
for	1
charity's	1
sake.	1
*A	1
hard-hearted	1
man.	1
The	1
driver	1
finished	1
by	1
hinting	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
so	1
hardly	1
used	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
brought	1
upon	1
herself	1
the	1
ill-will	1
of	1
Miss	1
Alice,	1
the	1
agent's	1
daughter.	1
Mary,	1
it	1
is	1
true,	1
had	1
refused	1
to	1
give	1
Miss	1
Alice	1
a	1
goat	1
upon	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
set	1
her	1
fancy;	1
but	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
offence	1
of	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
guilty,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
she	1
refused	1
it	1
her	1
mother	1
wanted	1
the	1
goat's	1
milk,	1
which	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
thing	1
she	1
then	1
liked	1
to	1
drink.	1
Mary	1
went	1
immediately	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Hopkins,	1
the	1
agent,	1
to	1
pay	1
her	1
rent;	1
and	1
she	1
begged	1
of	1
him	1
to	1
let	1
her	1
stay	1
another	1
year	1
in	1
her	1
cabin;	1
but	1
this	1
he	1
refused.	1
It	1
was	1
now	1
September	1
25th,	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
that	1
the	1
new	1
tenant	1
must	1
come	1
in	1
on	1
the	1
29th,	1
so	1
that	1
she	1
must	1
quit	1
it	1
directly.	1
Mary	1
could	1
not	1
bear	1
the	1
thoughts	1
of	1
begging	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
neighbours	1
to	1
take	1
her	1
and	1
her	1
brother	1
and	1
sisters	1
in	1
FOR	1
CHARITY'S	1
SAKE;	1
for	1
the	1
neighbours	1
were	1
all	1
poor	1
enough	1
themselves.	1
So	1
she	1
bethought	1
herself	1
that	1
she	1
might	1
find	1
shelter	1
in	1
the	1
ruins	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
castle	1
of	1
Rossmore	1
where	1
she	1
and	1
her	1
brother,	1
in	1
better	1
times,	1
had	1
often	1
played	1
at	1
hide	1
and	1
seek.	1
The	1
kitchen	1
and	1
two	1
other	1
rooms	1
near	1
it	1
were	1
yet	1
covered	1
in	1
tolerably	1
well;	1
and	1
a	1
little	1
thatch,	1
she	1
thought,	1
would	1
make	1
them	1
comfortable	1
through	1
the	1
winter.	1
The	1
agent	1
consented	1
to	1
let	1
her	1
and	1
her	1
brother	1
and	1
sisters	1
go	1
in	1
there,	1
upon	1
her	1
paying	1
him	1
half	1
a	1
guinea	1
in	1
hand,	1
and	1
promising	1
to	1
pay	1
the	1
same	1
yearly.	1
Into	1
these	1
lodgings	1
the	1
orphans	1
now	1
removed,	1
taking	1
with	1
them	1
two	1
bedsteads,	1
a	1
stool,	1
chair	1
and	1
a	1
table,	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
press,	1
which	1
contained	1
what	1
little	1
clothes	1
they	1
had,	1
and	1
a	1
chest	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
two	1
hundred	1
of	1
meal.	1
The	1
chest	1
was	1
carried	1
for	1
them	1
by	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
charitable	1
neighbours,	1
who	1
likewise	1
added	1
to	1
their	1
scanty	1
stock	1
of	1
potatoes	1
and	1
turf	1
what	1
would	1
make	1
it	1
last	1
through	1
the	1
winter.	1
These	1
children	1
were	1
well	1
thought	1
of	1
and	1
pitied,	1
because	1
their	1
mother	1
was	1
known	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
all	1
her	1
life	1
honest	1
and	1
industrious.	1
"Sure,"	1
says	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
neighbours,	1
"we	1
can	1
do	1
no	1
less	1
than	1
give	1
a	1
helping	1
hand	1
to	1
the	1
poor	1
orphans,	1
that	1
are	1
so	1
ready	1
to	1
help	1
themselves."	1
So	1
one	1
helped	1
to	1
thatch	1
the	1
room	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
sleep,	1
and	1
another	1
took	1
their	1
cow	1
to	1
graze	1
upon	1
his	1
bit	1
of	1
land	1
on	1
condition	1
of	1
having	1
half	1
the	1
milk;	1
and	1
one	1
and	1
all	1
said	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
welcome	1
to	1
take	1
share	1
of	1
their	1
potatoes	1
and	1
buttermilk	1
if	1
they	1
should	1
find	1
their	1
own	1
ever	1
fall	1
short.	1
The	1
half-guinea	1
which	1
Mr.	1
Hopkins,	1
the	1
agent,	1
required	1
for	1
letting	1
Mary	1
into	1
the	1
castle,	1
was	1
part	1
of	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
to	1
pay	1
to	1
the	1
schoolmistress,	1
to	1
whom	1
above	1
a	1
guinea	1
was	1
due.	1
Mary	1
went	1
to	1
her,	1
and	1
took	1
her	1
goat	1
along	1
with	1
her,	1
and	1
offered	1
it	1
in	1
part	1
of	1
payment	1
of	1
the	1
debt,	1
but	1
the	1
schoolmistress	1
would	1
not	1
receive	1
the	1
goat.	1
She	1
said	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
afford	1
to	1
wait	1
for	1
her	1
money	1
till	1
Mary	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
pay	1
it;	1
that	1
she	1
knew	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
honest,	1
industrious	1
little	1
girl,	1
and	1
she	1
would	1
trust	1
her	1
with	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
guinea.	1
Mary	1
thanked	1
her;	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
glad	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
goat	1
home	1
again,	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
very	1
fond	1
of	1
it.	1
Being	1
now	1
settled	1
in	1
their	1
house,	1
they	1
went	1
every	1
day	1
regularly	1
to	1
work;	1
Maud	1
spun	1
nine	1
cuts	1
a	1
day,	1
besides	1
doing	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
in	1
the	1
house;	1
Edmund	1
got	1
fourpence	1
a	1
day	1
by	1
his	1
work;	1
and	1
Peggy	1
and	1
Annie	1
earned	1
twopence	1
apiece	1
at	1
the	1
paper-mills	1
near	1
Navan,	1
where	1
they	1
were	1
employed	1
to	1
sort	1
rags,	1
and	1
to	1
cut	1
them	1
into	1
small	1
pieces.	1
When	1
they	1
had	1
done	1
work	1
one	1
day,	1
Annie	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
master	1
of	1
the	1
paper-	1
mill	1
and	1
asked	1
him	1
if	1
she	1
might	1
have	1
two	1
sheets	1
of	1
large	1
white	1
paper	1
which	1
were	1
lying	1
on	1
the	1
press.	1
She	1
offered	1
a	1
penny	1
for	1
the	1
paper;	1
but	1
the	1
master	1
would	1
not	1
take	1
anything	1
from	1
her,	1
but	1
gave	1
her	1
the	1
paper	1
when	1
he	1
found	1
that	1
she	1
wanted	1
it	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
garland	1
for	1
her	1
mother's	1
grave.	1
Annie	1
and	1
Peggy	1
cut	1
out	1
the	1
garland,	1
and	1
Mary,	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
finished,	1
went	1
along	1
with	1
them	1
and	1
Edmund	1
to	1
put	1
it	1
up.	1
It	1
was	1
just	1
a	1
month	1
after	1
their	1
mother's	1
death.	1
It	1
happened,	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
the	1
orphans	1
were	1
putting	1
up	1
this	1
garland,	1
that	1
two	1
young	1
ladies,	1
who	1
were	1
returning	1
home	1
after	1
their	1
evening	1
walk,	1
stopped	1
at	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
the	1
churchyard	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
red	1
light	1
which	1
the	1
setting	1
sun	1
cast	1
upon	1
the	1
window	1
of	1
the	1
church.	1
As	1
the	1
ladies	1
were	1
standing	1
at	1
the	1
gate,	1
they	1
heard	1
a	1
voice	1
near	1
them	1
crying,	1
"O,	1
mother!	1
mother!	1
are	1
you	1
gone	1
for	1
ever?"	1
They	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
anyone,	1
so	1
they	1
walked	1
softly	1
round	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
church,	1
and	1
there	1
they	1
saw	1
Mary	1
kneeling	1
beside	1
a	1
grave,	1
on	1
which	1
her	1
brothers	1
and	1
sisters	1
were	1
hanging	1
their	1
white	1
garlands.	1
The	1
children	1
all	1
stood	1
still	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
the	1
two	1
ladies	1
passing	1
near	1
them;	1
but	1
Mary	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
anybody	1
was	1
passing,	1
for	1
her	1
face	1
was	1
hid	1
in	1
her	1
hands.	1
Isabella	1
and	1
Caroline	1
(so	1
these	1
ladies	1
were	1
called)	1
would	1
not	1
disturb	1
the	1
poor	1
children;	1
but	1
they	1
stopped	1
in	1
the	1
village	1
to	1
inquire	1
about	1
them.	1
It	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
schoolmistress	1
that	1
they	1
stopped,	1
and	1
she	1
gave	1
them	1
a	1
good	1
account	1
of	1
these	1
orphans.	1
She	1
particularly	1
commended	1
Mary's	1
honesty,	1
in	1
having	1
immediately	1
paid	1
all	1
her	1
mother's	1
debts	1
to	1
the	1
utmost	1
farthing,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
her	1
money	1
would	1
go.	1
She	1
told	1
the	1
ladies	1
how	1
Mary	1
had	1
been	1
turned	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
house,	1
and	1
how	1
she	1
had	1
offered	1
her	1
goat,	1
of	1
which	1
she	1
was	1
very	1
fond,	1
to	1
discharge	1
a	1
debt	1
due	1
for	1
her	1
schooling;	1
and,	1
in	1
short,	1
the	1
schoolmistress,	1
who	1
had	1
known	1
Mary	1
for	1
several	1
years,	1
spoke	1
so	1
well	1
of	1
her	1
that	1
these	1
ladies	1
resolved	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
castle	1
of	1
Rossmore	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
the	1
next	1
day.	1
When	1
they	1
went	1
there,	1
they	1
found	1
the	1
room	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
children	1
lived	1
as	1
clean	1
and	1
neat	1
as	1
such	1
a	1
ruined	1
place	1
could	1
be	1
made.	1
Edmund	1
was	1
out	1
working	1
with	1
a	1
farmer,	1
Mary	1
was	1
spinning,	1
and	1
her	1
little	1
sisters	1
were	1
measuring	1
out	1
some	1
bogberries,	1
of	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
gathered	1
a	1
basketful,	1
for	1
sale.	1
Isabella,	1
after	1
telling	1
Mary	1
what	1
an	1
excellent	1
character	1
she	1
had	1
heard	1
of	1
her,	1
inquired	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
she	1
most	1
wanted;	1
and	1
Mary	1
said	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
just	1
worked	1
up	1
all	1
her	1
flax,	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
most	1
in	1
want	1
of	1
more	1
flax	1
for	1
her	1
wheel.	1
Isabella	1
promised	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
send	1
her	1
a	1
fresh	1
supply	1
of	1
flax,	1
and	1
Caroline	1
bought	1
the	1
bogberries	1
from	1
the	1
little	1
girls,	1
and	1
gave	1
them	1
money	1
enough	1
to	1
buy	1
a	1
pound	1
of	1
coarse	1
cotton	1
for	1
knitting,	1
as	1
Mary	1
said	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
teach	1
them	1
how	1
to	1
knit.	1
The	1
supply	1
of	1
flax,	1
which	1
Isabella	1
sent	1
the	1
next	1
day,	1
was	1
of	1
great	1
service	1
to	1
Mary,	1
as	1
it	1
kept	1
her	1
in	1
employment	1
for	1
above	1
a	1
month;	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
sold	1
the	1
yarn	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
spun	1
with	1
it,	1
she	1
had	1
money	1
enough	1
to	1
buy	1
some	1
warm	1
flannel	1
for	1
winter	1
wear.	1
Besides	1
spinning	1
well,	1
she	1
had	1
learned	1
at	1
school	1
to	1
do	1
plain	1
work	1
tolerably	1
neatly,	1
and	1
Isabella	1
and	1
Caroline	1
employed	1
her	1
to	1
work	1
for	1
them;	1
by	1
which	1
she	1
earned	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
more	1
than	1
she	1
could	1
by	1
spinning.	1
At	1
her	1
leisure	1
hours	1
she	1
taught	1
her	1
sisters	1
to	1
read	1
and	1
write;	1
and	1
Edmund,	1
with	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
money	1
which	1
he	1
earned	1
by	1
his	1
work	1
out	1
of	1
doors,	1
paid	1
a	1
schoolmaster	1
for	1
teaching	1
him	1
a	1
little	1
arithmetic.	1
When	1
the	1
winter	1
nights	1
came	1
on,	1
he	1
used	1
to	1
light	1
his	1
rush	1
candles	1
for	1
Mary	1
to	1
work	1
by.	1
He	1
had	1
gathered	1
and	1
stripped	1
a	1
good	1
provision	1
of	1
rushes	1
in	1
the	1
month	1
of	1
August,	1
and	1
a	1
neighbour	1
gave	1
him	1
grease	1
to	1
dip	1
them	1
in.	1
One	1
evening,	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
lighted	1
his	1
candles,	1
a	1
footman	1
came	1
in,	1
who	1
was	1
sent	1
by	1
Isabella	1
with	1
some	1
plain	1
work	1
to	1
Mary.	1
This	1
servant	1
was	1
an	1
Englishman,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
but	1
newly	1
come	1
over	1
to	1
Ireland.	1
The	1
rush	1
candles	1
caught	1
his	1
attention;	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
any	1
of	1
them	1
before,	1
as	1
he	1
came	1
from	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
England	1
where	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
used.	1
Edmund,	1
who	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
oblige,	1
and	1
proud	1
that	1
his	1
candles	1
were	1
noticed	1
showed	1
the	1
Englishman	1
how	1
they	1
were	1
made,	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
bundle	1
of	1
rushes.*	1
[*"The	1
proper	1
species	1
of	1
rush,"	1
says	1
White,	1
in	1
his	1
'Natural	1
History	1
of	1
Selborne,'	1
"seems	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
Juncus	1
effusus,	1
or	1
common	1
soft	1
rush,	1
which	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
moist	1
pastures,	1
by	1
the	1
sides	1
of	1
streams,	1
and	1
under	1
hedges.	1
These	1
rushes	1
are	1
in	1
best	1
condition	1
in	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
summer,	1
but	1
may	1
be	1
gathered	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
serve	1
the	1
purpose	1
well	1
quite	1
on	1
to	1
autumn.	1
The	1
largest	1
and	1
longest	1
are	1
the	1
best.	1
Decayed	1
labourers,	1
women,	1
and	1
children	1
make	1
it	1
their	1
business	1
to	1
procure	1
and	1
prepare	1
them.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
are	1
cut,	1
they	1
must	1
be	1
flung	1
into	1
water,	1
and	1
kept	1
there;	1
for	1
otherwise	1
they	1
will	1
dry	1
and	1
shrink,	1
and	1
the	1
peel	1
will	1
not	1
run.	1
When	1
these	1
junci	1
are	1
thus	1
far	1
prepared,	1
they	1
must	1
lie	1
out	1
on	1
the	1
grass	1
to	1
be	1
bleached	1
and	1
take	1
the	1
dew	1
for	1
some	1
nights,	1
and	1
afterwards	1
be	1
dried	1
in	1
the	1
sun.	1
Some	1
address	1
is	1
required	1
in	1
dipping	1
these	1
rushes	1
in	1
the	1
scalding	1
fat	1
or	1
grease;	1
but	1
this	1
knack	1
is	1
also	1
to	1
be	1
attained	1
by	1
practice.	1
A	1
pound	1
of	1
common	1
grease	1
may	1
be	1
procured	1
for	1
fourpence,	1
and	1
about	1
six	1
pounds	1
of	1
grease	1
will	1
dip	1
a	1
pound	1
of	1
rushes	1
and	1
one	1
pound	1
of	1
rushes	1
may	1
be	1
bought	1
for	1
one	1
shilling;	1
so	1
that	1
a	1
pound	1
of	1
rushes,	1
medicated	1
and	1
ready	1
for	1
use,	1
will	1
cost	1
three	1
shillings."]	1
The	1
servant	1
was	1
pleased	1
with	1
his	1
good	1
nature	1
in	1
this	1
trifling	1
instance,	1
and	1
remembered	1
it	1
long	1
after	1
it	1
was	1
forgotten	1
by	1
Edmund.	1
Whenever	1
his	1
master	1
wanted	1
to	1
send	1
a	1
messenger	1
anywhere,	1
Gilbert	1
(for	1
that	1
was	1
the	1
servant's	1
name)	1
always	1
employed	1
his	1
little	1
friend	1
Edmund,	1
whom,	1
upon	1
further	1
acquaintance,	1
he	1
liked	1
better	1
and	1
better.	1
He	1
found	1
that	1
Edmund	1
was	1
both	1
quick	1
and	1
exact	1
in	1
executing	1
commissions.	1
One	1
day,	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
waited	1
a	1
great	1
while	1
at	1
a	1
gentleman's	1
house	1
for	1
an	1
answer	1
to	1
a	1
letter,	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
impatient	1
to	1
get	1
home	1
that	1
he	1
ran	1
off	1
without	1
it.	1
When	1
he	1
was	1
questioned	1
by	1
Gilbert	1
why	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
bring	1
an	1
answer,	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
attempt	1
to	1
make	1
any	1
excuse;	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
say,	1
"There	1
was	1
no	1
answer,	1
please	1
your	1
honour,"	1
or,	1
"They	1
bid	1
me	1
not	1
to	1
wait,"	1
etc.;	1
but	1
he	1
told	1
exactly	1
the	1
truth;	1
and	1
though	1
Gilbert	1
scolded	1
him	1
for	1
being	1
so	1
impatient	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
wait,	1
yet	1
his	1
telling	1
the	1
truth	1
was	1
more	1
to	1
the	1
boy's	1
advantage	1
than	1
any	1
excuse	1
he	1
could	1
have	1
made.	1
After	1
this	1
he	1
was	1
always	1
believed	1
when	1
he	1
said,	1
"There	1
was	1
no	1
answer,"	1
or,	1
"They	1
bid	1
me	1
not	1
wait";	1
for	1
Gilbert	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
tell	1
a	1
lie	1
to	1
save	1
himself	1
from	1
being	1
scolded.	1
The	1
orphans	1
continued	1
to	1
assist	1
one	1
another	1
in	1
their	1
work	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
strength	1
and	1
abilities;	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
on	1
in	1
this	1
manner	1
for	1
three	1
years.	1
With	1
what	1
Mary	1
got	1
by	1
her	1
spinning	1
and	1
plain	1
work,	1
and	1
Edmund	1
by	1
leading	1
of	1
cart-horses,	1
going	1
on	1
errands,	1
etc.,	1
and	1
with	1
little	1
Peggy	1
and	1
Anne's	1
earnings,	1
the	1
family	1
contrived	1
to	1
live	1
comfortably.	1
Isabella	1
and	1
Caroline	1
often	1
visited	1
them,	1
and	1
sometimes	1
gave	1
them	1
clothes,	1
and	1
sometimes	1
flax	1
or	1
cotton	1
for	1
their	1
spinning	1
and	1
knitting;	1
and	1
these	1
children	1
did	1
not	1
EXPECT,	1
that	1
because	1
the	1
ladies	1
did	1
something	1
for	1
them,	1
they	1
should	1
do	1
everything.	1
They	1
did	1
not	1
grow	1
idle	1
or	1
wasteful.	1
When	1
Edmund	1
was	1
about	1
twelve	1
years	1
old,	1
his	1
friend	1
Gilbert	1
sent	1
for	1
him	1
one	1
day,	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
his	1
master	1
had	1
given	1
him	1
leave	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
boy	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
to	1
assist	1
him,	1
and	1
that	1
his	1
master	1
told	1
him	1
he	1
might	1
choose	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
neighbourhood.	1
Several	1
were	1
anxious	1
to	1
get	1
into	1
such	1
a	1
good	1
place:	1
but	1
Gilbert	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
preferred	1
Edmund	1
before	1
them	1
all,	1
because	1
he	1
knew	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
industrious,	1
honest,	1
good	1
natured	1
lad,	1
who	1
always	1
told	1
the	1
truth.	1
So	1
Edmund	1
went	1
into	1
service	1
at	1
the	1
vicarage;	1
and	1
his	1
master	1
was	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
Isabella	1
and	1
Caroline.	1
He	1
found	1
his	1
new	1
way	1
of	1
life	1
very	1
pleasant;	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
well	1
fed,	1
well	1
clothed,	1
and	1
well	1
treated;	1
and	1
he	1
every	1
day	1
learned	1
more	1
of	1
his	1
business,	1
in	1
which	1
at	1
first	1
he	1
was	1
rather	1
awkward.	1
He	1
was	1
mindful	1
to	1
do	1
all	1
that	1
Mr.	1
Gilbert	1
required	1
of	1
him;	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
obliging	1
to	1
all	1
his	1
fellow-servants	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
liking	1
him.	1
But	1
there	1
was	1
one	1
thing	1
which	1
was	1
at	1
first	1
rather	1
disagreeable	1
to	1
him:	1
he	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
wear	1
shoes	1
and	1
stockings,	1
and	1
they	1
hurt	1
his	1
feet.	1
Besides	1
this,	1
when	1
he	1
waited	1
at	1
dinner	1
he	1
made	1
such	1
a	1
noise	1
in	1
walking	1
that	1
his	1
fellow-servants	1
laughed	1
at	1
him.	1
He	1
told	1
his	1
sister	1
Mary	1
of	1
his	1
distress,	1
and	1
she	1
made	1
for	1
him,	1
after	1
many	1
trials,	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
cloth	1
shoes,	1
with	1
soles	1
of	1
platted	1
hemp.*	1
In	1
these	1
he	1
could	1
walk	1
without	1
making	1
the	1
least	1
noise;	1
and	1
as	1
these	1
shoes	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
worn	1
out	1
of	1
doors,	1
he	1
was	1
always	1
sure	1
to	1
change	1
them	1
before	1
he	1
went	1
out;	1
and	1
consequently	1
he	1
had	1
always	1
clean	1
shoes	1
to	1
wear	1
in	1
the	1
house.	1
[*The	1
author	1
has	1
seen	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
shoes,	1
such	1
as	1
here	1
described,	1
made	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
hours.]	1
It	1
was	1
soon	1
remarked	1
by	1
the	1
men-servants	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
off	1
clumping	1
so	1
heavily,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
observed	1
by	1
the	1
maids	1
that	1
he	1
never	1
dirtied	1
the	1
stairs	1
or	1
passages	1
with	1
his	1
shoes.	1
When	1
he	1
was	1
praised	1
for	1
these	1
things,	1
he	1
said	1
it	1
was	1
his	1
sister	1
Mary	1
who	1
should	1
be	1
thanked,	1
and	1
not	1
he;	1
and	1
he	1
showed	1
the	1
shoes	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
made	1
for	1
him.	1
Isabella's	1
maid	1
bespoke	1
a	1
pair	1
immediately,	1
and	1
sent	1
Mary	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
pretty	1
calico	1
for	1
the	1
outside.	1
The	1
last-maker	1
made	1
a	1
last	1
for	1
her,	1
and	1
over	1
this	1
Mary	1
sewed	1
the	1
calico	1
vamps	1
tight.	1
Her	1
brother	1
advised	1
her	1
to	1
try	1
platted	1
packthread	1
instead	1
of	1
hemp	1
for	1
the	1
soles;	1
and	1
she	1
found	1
that	1
this	1
looked	1
more	1
neat	1
than	1
the	1
hemp	1
soles,	1
and	1
was	1
likely	1
to	1
last	1
longer.	1
She	1
platted	1
the	1
packthread	1
together	1
in	1
strands	1
of	1
about	1
half	1
an	1
inch	1
thick,	1
and	1
these	1
were	1
served	1
firmly	1
together	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
shoe.	1
When	1
they	1
were	1
finished	1
they	1
fitted	1
well,	1
and	1
the	1
maid	1
showed	1
them	1
to	1
her	1
mistress.	1
Isabella	1
and	1
Caroline	1
were	1
so	1
well	1
pleased	1
with	1
Mary's	1
ingenuity	1
and	1
kindness	1
to	1
her	1
brother,	1
that	1
they	1
bespoke	1
from	1
her	1
two	1
dozen	1
of	1
these	1
shoes,	1
and	1
gave	1
her	1
three	1
yards	1
of	1
coloured	1
fustian	1
to	1
make	1
them	1
of,	1
and	1
galloon	1
for	1
the	1
binding.	1
When	1
the	1
shoes	1
were	1
completed,	1
Isabella	1
and	1
Caroline	1
disposed	1
of	1
them	1
for	1
her	1
amongst	1
their	1
acquaintance,	1
and	1
got	1
three	1
shillings	1
a	1
pair	1
for	1
them.	1
The	1
young	1
ladies,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
collected	1
the	1
money,	1
walked	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
castle,	1
where	1
they	1
found	1
everything	1
neat	1
and	1
clean	1
as	1
usual.	1
They	1
had	1
great	1
pleasure	1
in	1
giving	1
to	1
this	1
industrious	1
girl	1
the	1
reward	1
of	1
her	1
ingenuity,	1
which	1
she	1
received	1
with	1
some	1
surprise	1
and	1
more	1
gratitude.	1
They	1
advised	1
her	1
to	1
continue	1
the	1
shoemaking	1
trade,	1
as	1
they	1
found	1
the	1
shoes	1
were	1
liked,	1
and	1
they	1
knew	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
have	1
a	1
sale	1
for	1
them	1
at	1
the	1
Repository	1
in	1
Dublin.	1
Mary,	1
encouraged	1
by	1
these	1
kind	1
friends,	1
went	1
on	1
with	1
her	1
little	1
manufacture	1
with	1
increased	1
activity.	1
Peggy	1
and	1
Anne	1
platted	1
the	1
packthread,	1
and	1
basted	1
the	1
vamps	1
and	1
linings	1
together	1
ready	1
for	1
her.	1
Edmund	1
was	1
allowed	1
to	1
come	1
home	1
for	1
an	1
hour	1
every	1
morning,	1
provided	1
he	1
was	1
back	1
again	1
before	1
eight	1
o'clock.	1
It	1
was	1
summer	1
time,	1
and	1
he	1
got	1
up	1
early,	1
because	1
he	1
liked	1
to	1
go	1
home	1
to	1
see	1
his	1
sisters,	1
and	1
he	1
took	1
his	1
share	1
in	1
the	1
manufactory.	1
It	1
was	1
his	1
business	1
to	1
hammer	1
the	1
soles	1
flat:	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
came	1
home	1
every	1
morning	1
he	1
performed	1
his	1
task	1
with	1
so	1
much	1
cheerfulness	1
and	1
sang	1
so	1
merrily	1
at	1
his	1
work,	1
that	1
the	1
hour	1
of	1
his	1
arrival	1
was	1
always	1
an	1
hour	1
of	1
joy	1
to	1
the	1
family.	1
Mary	1
had	1
presently	1
employment	1
enough	1
upon	1
her	1
hands.	1
Orders	1
came	1
to	1
her	1
for	1
shoes	1
from	1
many	1
families	1
in	1
the	1
neighbourhood,	1
and	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
get	1
them	1
finished	1
fast	1
enough.	1
She,	1
however,	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
her	1
hurry,	1
found	1
time	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
very	1
pretty	1
pair,	1
with	1
neat	1
roses,	1
as	1
a	1
present	1
for	1
her	1
schoolmistress,	1
who,	1
now	1
that	1
she	1
saw	1
her	1
pupil	1
in	1
a	1
good	1
way	1
of	1
business,	1
consented	1
to	1
receive	1
the	1
amount	1
of	1
her	1
old	1
debt.	1
Several	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
who	1
went	1
to	1
her	1
school	1
were	1
delighted	1
with	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
Mary's	1
present,	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
little	1
manufactory	1
at	1
Rossmore	1
Castle,	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
how	1
these	1
shoes	1
were	1
made.	1
Some	1
went	1
from	1
curiosity,	1
others	1
from	1
idleness;	1
but	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
how	1
happy	1
the	1
little	1
shoemakers	1
seemed	1
whilst	1
busy	1
at	1
work,	1
they	1
longed	1
to	1
take	1
some	1
share	1
in	1
what	1
was	1
going	1
forward.	1
One	1
begged	1
Mary	1
to	1
let	1
her	1
plat	1
some	1
packthread	1
for	1
the	1
soles;	1
another	1
helped	1
Peggy	1
and	1
Anne	1
to	1
baste	1
in	1
the	1
linings;	1
and	1
all	1
who	1
could	1
get	1
employment	1
were	1
pleased,	1
for	1
the	1
idle	1
ones	1
were	1
shoved	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way.	1
It	1
became	1
a	1
custom	1
with	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
village	1
to	1
resort	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
castle	1
at	1
their	1
play	1
hours;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
surprising	1
to	1
see	1
how	1
much	1
was	1
done	1
by	1
ten	1
or	1
twelve	1
of	1
them,	1
each	1
doing	1
but	1
a	1
little	1
at	1
a	1
time.	1
One	1
morning	1
Edmund	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
manufacturers	1
were	1
assembled	1
very	1
early,	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
busy	1
at	1
their	1
work,	1
all	1
sitting	1
round	1
the	1
meal	1
chest,	1
which	1
served	1
them	1
for	1
a	1
table.	1
"My	1
hands	1
must	1
be	1
washed,"	1
said	1
George,	1
a	1
little	1
boy	1
who	1
came	1
running	1
in;	1
"I	1
ran	1
so	1
fast	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
be	1
in	1
time,	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
work	1
along	1
with	1
you	1
all,	1
that	1
I	1
tumbled	1
down,	1
and	1
look	1
how	1
I	1
have	1
dirtied	1
my	1
hands.	1
Most	1
haste	1
worst	1
speed.	1
My	1
hands	1
must	1
be	1
washed	1
before	1
I	1
can	1
do	1
anything."	1
Whilst	1
George	1
was	1
washing	1
his	1
hands,	1
two	1
other	1
little	1
children,	1
who	1
had	1
just	1
finished	1
their	1
morning's	1
work,	1
came	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
beg	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
blow	1
some	1
soap	1
bubbles	1
for	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
three	1
eagerly	1
blowing	1
bubbles,	1
and	1
watching	1
them	1
mount	1
into	1
the	1
air,	1
when	1
suddenly	1
they	1
were	1
startled	1
by	1
a	1
noise	1
as	1
loud	1
as	1
thunder.	1
They	1
were	1
in	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
outer	1
court	1
of	1
the	1
castle,	1
next	1
to	1
the	1
room	1
in	1
which	1
all	1
their	1
companions	1
were	1
at	1
work,	1
and	1
they	1
ran	1
precipitately	1
into	1
the	1
room,	1
exclaiming,	1
"Did	1
you	1
hear	1
that	1
noise?"	1
"I	1
thought	1
I	1
heard	1
a	1
clap	1
of	1
thunder,"	1
said	1
Mary,	1
"but	1
why	1
do	1
you	1
look	1
so	1
frightened?"	1
As	1
she	1
finished	1
speaking,	1
another	1
and	1
a	1
louder	1
noise,	1
and	1
the	1
walls	1
round	1
about	1
them	1
shook.	1
The	1
children	1
turned	1
pale	1
and	1
stood	1
motionless;	1
but	1
Edmund	1
threw	1
down	1
his	1
hammer,	1
and	1
ran	1
out	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
matter.	1
Mary	1
followed	1
him,	1
and	1
they	1
saw	1
that	1
a	1
great	1
chimney	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
ruins	1
at	1
the	1
farthest	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
castle	1
had	1
fallen	1
down,	1
and	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
prodigious	1
noise.	1
The	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
castle	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
lived	1
seemed,	1
as	1
Edmund	1
said,	1
to	1
be	1
perfectly	1
safe;	1
but	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
village	1
were	1
terrified,	1
and	1
thinking	1
that	1
the	1
whole	1
would	1
come	1
tumbling	1
down	1
directly,	1
they	1
ran	1
to	1
their	1
homes	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
they	1
could.	1
Edmund,	1
who	1
was	1
a	1
courageous	1
lad,	1
and	1
proud	1
of	1
showing	1
his	1
courage,	1
laughed	1
at	1
their	1
cowardice;	1
but	1
Mary,	1
who	1
was	1
very	1
prudent,	1
persuaded	1
her	1
brother	1
to	1
ask	1
an	1
experienced	1
mason,	1
who	1
was	1
building	1
at	1
his	1
master's,	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
give	1
his	1
opinion,	1
whether	1
their	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
castle	1
was	1
safe	1
to	1
live	1
in	1
or	1
not.	1
The	1
mason	1
came,	1
and	1
gave	1
it	1
as	1
his	1
opinion	1
that	1
the	1
rooms	1
they	1
inhabited	1
might	1
last	1
through	1
the	1
winter	1
but	1
that	1
no	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
ruins	1
could	1
stand	1
another	1
year.	1
Mary	1
was	1
sorry	1
to	1
leave	1
a	1
place	1
of	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
grown	1
fond,	1
poor	1
as	1
it	1
was,	1
having	1
lived	1
in	1
it	1
in	1
peace	1
and	1
contentment	1
ever	1
since	1
her	1
mother's	1
death,	1
which	1
was	1
now	1
nearly	1
four	1
years;	1
but	1
she	1
determined	1
to	1
look	1
out	1
for	1
some	1
other	1
place	1
to	1
live	1
in;	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
now	1
money	1
enough	1
to	1
pay	1
the	1
rent	1
of	1
a	1
comfortable	1
cabin.	1
Without	1
losing	1
any	1
time,	1
she	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
village	1
that	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
avenue	1
leading	1
to	1
the	1
vicarage,	1
for	1
she	1
wished	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
lodging	1
in	1
this	1
village	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
near	1
to	1
her	1
brother,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
ladies	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
kind	1
to	1
her.	1
She	1
found	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
one	1
newly	1
built	1
house	1
in	1
this	1
village	1
unoccupied;	1
it	1
belonged	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Harvey,	1
her	1
landlord,	1
who	1
was	1
still	1
in	1
England;	1
it	1
was	1
slated,	1
and	1
neatly	1
fitted	1
up	1
inside;	1
but	1
the	1
rent	1
of	1
it	1
was	1
six	1
guineas	1
a	1
year,	1
and	1
this	1
was	1
far	1
above	1
what	1
Mary	1
could	1
afford	1
to	1
pay.	1
Three	1
guineas	1
a	1
year	1
she	1
thought	1
was	1
the	1
highest	1
rent	1
for	1
which	1
she	1
could	1
venture	1
to	1
engage.	1
Besides,	1
she	1
heard	1
that	1
several	1
proposals	1
had	1
been	1
made	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Harvey	1
for	1
this	1
house,	1
and	1
she	1
knew	1
that	1
Mr.	1
Hopkins,	1
the	1
agent,	1
was	1
not	1
her	1
friend;	1
therefore	1
she	1
despaired	1
of	1
getting	1
it.	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
other	1
to	1
be	1
had	1
in	1
this	1
village.	1
Her	1
brother	1
was	1
still	1
more	1
vexed	1
than	1
she	1
was,	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
find	1
a	1
place	1
near	1
him.	1
He	1
offered	1
to	1
give	1
a	1
guinea	1
yearly	1
towards	1
the	1
rent	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
wages;	1
and	1
Mr.	1
Gilbert	1
spoke	1
about	1
it	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
steward,	1
and	1
inquired	1
whether,	1
amongst	1
any	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
given	1
in	1
proposals,	1
there	1
might	1
not	1
be	1
one	1
who	1
would	1
be	1
content	1
with	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
who	1
would	1
join	1
with	1
Mary	1
in	1
paying	1
the	1
rent.	1
None	1
could	1
be	1
found	1
but	1
a	1
woman,	1
who	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
scold,	1
and	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
was	1
famous	1
for	1
going	1
to	1
law	1
about	1
every	1
trifle	1
with	1
his	1
neighbours.	1
Mary	1
did	1
not	1
choose	1
to	1
have	1
anything	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
these	1
people.	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
to	1
speak	1
either	1
to	1
Miss	1
Isabella	1
or	1
Caroline	1
about	1
it,	1
because	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
of	1
an	1
encroaching	1
temper;	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
done	1
so	1
much	1
for	1
her,	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
ashamed	1
to	1
beg	1
for	1
more.	1
She	1
returned	1
home	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
castle,	1
mortified	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
good	1
news	1
to	1
tell	1
Anne	1
and	1
Peggy,	1
who	1
she	1
knew	1
expected	1
to	1
hear	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
found	1
a	1
nice	1
house	1
for	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
village	1
near	1
their	1
brother.	1
"Bad	1
news	1
for	1
you,	1
Peggy,"	1
cried	1
she,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
got	1
home.	1
"And	1
bad	1
news	1
for	1
you,	1
Mary,"	1
replied	1
her	1
sisters,	1
who	1
looked	1
very	1
sorrowful.	1
"What's	1
the	1
matter?"	1
"Your	1
poor	1
goat	1
is	1
dead,"	1
replied	1
Peggy.	1
"There	1
she	1
is,	1
yonder,	1
lying	1
under	1
the	1
great	1
corner	1
stone;	1
you	1
can	1
just	1
see	1
her	1
leg.	1
We	1
cannot	1
lift	1
the	1
stone	1
from	1
off	1
her,	1
it	1
is	1
so	1
heavy.	1
Betsy	1
[one	1
of	1
the	1
neighbour's	1
girls]	1
says	1
she	1
remembers,	1
when	1
she	1
came	1
to	1
us	1
to	1
work	1
early	1
this	1
morning,	1
she	1
saw	1
the	1
goat	1
rubbing	1
itself,	1
and	1
butting	1
with	1
its	1
horns	1
against	1
that	1
old	1
tottering	1
chimney."	1
"Many's	1
the	1
time,"	1
said	1
Mary,	1
"that	1
I	1
have	1
driven	1
the	1
poor	1
thing	1
away	1
from	1
that	1
place;	1
I	1
was	1
always	1
afraid	1
she	1
would	1
shake	1
that	1
great	1
ugly	1
stone	1
down	1
upon	1
her	1
at	1
last."	1
The	1
goat,	1
who	1
had	1
long	1
been	1
the	1
favourite	1
of	1
Mary	1
and	1
her	1
sisters,	1
was	1
lamented	1
by	1
them	1
all.	1
When	1
Edmund	1
came,	1
he	1
helped	1
them	1
to	1
move	1
the	1
great	1
stone	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
poor	1
animal,	1
who	1
was	1
crushed	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
terrible	1
sight.	1
As	1
they	1
were	1
moving	1
away	1
this	1
stone	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
bury	1
the	1
goat,	1
Anne	1
found	1
an	1
odd-looking	1
piece	1
of	1
money,	1
which	1
seemed	1
neither	1
like	1
a	1
halfpenny,	1
nor	1
a	1
shilling,	1
nor	1
a	1
guinea.	1
"Here	1
are	1
more,	1
a	1
great	1
many	1
more	1
of	1
them,"	1
cried	1
Peggy;	1
and	1
upon	1
searching	1
amongst	1
the	1
rubbish,	1
they	1
discovered	1
a	1
small	1
iron	1
pot,	1
which	1
seemed	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
filled	1
with	1
these	1
coins,	1
as	1
a	1
vast	1
number	1
of	1
them	1
were	1
found	1
about	1
the	1
spot	1
where	1
it	1
fell.	1
On	1
examining	1
these	1
coins,	1
Edmund	1
thought	1
that	1
several	1
of	1
them	1
looked	1
like	1
gold,	1
and	1
the	1
girls	1
exclaimed	1
with	1
great	1
joy--"Oh,	1
Mary!	1
Mary!	1
this	1
is	1
come	1
to	1
us	1
just	1
in	1
right	1
time--now	1
you	1
can	1
pay	1
for	1
the	1
slated	1
house.	1
Never	1
was	1
anything	1
so	1
lucky!"	1
But	1
Mary,	1
though	1
nothing	1
could	1
have	1
pleased	1
her	1
better	1
than	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
pay	1
for	1
the	1
house,	1
observed	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
honestly	1
touch	1
any	1
of	1
this	1
treasure,	1
as	1
it	1
belonged	1
to	1
the	1
owner	1
of	1
the	1
castle.	1
Edmund	1
agreed	1
with	1
her,	1
that	1
they	1
ought	1
to	1
carry	1
it	1
all	1
immediately	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Hopkins,	1
the	1
agent.	1
Peggy	1
and	1
Anne	1
were	1
convinced	1
by	1
what	1
Mary	1
said,	1
and	1
they	1
begged	1
to	1
go	1
along	1
with	1
her	1
and	1
their	1
brother,	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
coins	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Hopkins.	1
On	1
their	1
way	1
they	1
stopped	1
at	1
the	1
vicarage,	1
to	1
show	1
the	1
treasure	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Gilbert,	1
who	1
took	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
young	1
ladies,	1
Isabella	1
and	1
Caroline,	1
and	1
told	1
them	1
how	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
found.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
only	1
by	1
their	1
superior	1
riches,	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
yet	1
more	1
by	1
their	1
superior	1
knowledge,	1
that	1
persons	1
in	1
the	1
higher	1
rank	1
of	1
life	1
may	1
assist	1
those	1
in	1
a	1
lower	1
condition.	1
Isabella,	1
who	1
had	1
some	1
knowledge	1
of	1
chemistry,	1
discovered,	1
by	1
touching	1
the	1
coins	1
with	1
nitric	1
acid,	1
that	1
several	1
of	1
them	1
were	1
of	1
gold,	1
and	1
consequently	1
of	1
great	1
value.	1
Caroline	1
also	1
found	1
out	1
that	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
coins	1
were	1
very	1
valuable	1
as	1
curiosities.	1
She	1
recollected	1
her	1
father's	1
having	1
shown	1
to	1
her	1
the	1
prints	1
of	1
the	1
coins	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
each	1
king's	1
reign,	1
in	1
"Rapin's	1
History	1
of	1
England;"	1
and	1
upon	1
comparing	1
these	1
impressions	1
with	1
the	1
coins	1
found	1
by	1
the	1
orphans,	1
she	1
perceived	1
that	1
many	1
of	1
them	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
Henry	1
the	1
Seventh,	1
which,	1
from	1
their	1
scarcity,	1
were	1
highly	1
appreciated	1
by	1
numismatic	1
collectors.	1
Isabella	1
and	1
Caroline,	1
knowing	1
something	1
of	1
the	1
character	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Hopkins,	1
the	1
agent,	1
had	1
the	1
precaution	1
to	1
count	1
the	1
coins,	1
and	1
to	1
mark	1
each	1
of	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
cross,	1
so	1
small	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
scarcely	1
visible	1
to	1
the	1
naked	1
eye,	1
though	1
it	1
was	1
easily	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
through	1
a	1
magnifying	1
glass.	1
They	1
also	1
begged	1
that	1
their	1
father,	1
who	1
was	1
well	1
acquainted	1
with	1
Mr.	1
Harvey,	1
the	1
gentleman	1
to	1
whom	1
Rossmore	1
Castle	1
belonged,	1
to	1
write	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
tell	1
him	1
how	1
well	1
these	1
orphans	1
had	1
behaved	1
about	1
the	1
treasure	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
found.	1
The	1
value	1
of	1
the	1
coins	1
was	1
estimated	1
at	1
about	1
thirty	1
or	1
forty	1
guineas.	1
A	1
few	1
days	1
after	1
the	1
fall	1
of	1
the	1
chimney	1
at	1
Rossmore	1
Castle,	1
as	1
Mary	1
and	1
her	1
sisters	1
were	1
sitting	1
at	1
their	1
work,	1
there	1
came	1
hobbling	1
in	1
an	1
old	1
woman,	1
leaning	1
on	1
a	1
crab	1
stick,	1
that	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
newly	1
cut.	1
She	1
had	1
a	1
broken	1
tobacco-pipe	1
in	1
her	1
mouth;	1
her	1
head	1
was	1
wrapped	1
up	1
in	1
two	1
large	1
red	1
and	1
blue	1
handkerchiefs,	1
with	1
their	1
crooked	1
corners	1
hanging	1
far	1
down	1
over	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
her	1
neck,	1
no	1
shoes	1
on	1
her	1
broad	1
feet,	1
nor	1
stockings	1
on	1
her	1
many-coloured	1
legs.	1
Her	1
petticoat	1
was	1
jagged	1
at	1
the	1
bottom,	1
and	1
the	1
skirt	1
of	1
her	1
gown	1
turned	1
up	1
over	1
her	1
shoulders,	1
to	1
serve	1
instead	1
of	1
a	1
cloak,	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
sold	1
for	1
whisky.	1
This	1
old	1
woman	1
was	1
well	1
known	1
amongst	1
the	1
country	1
people	1
by	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Goody	1
Grope:*	1
because	1
she	1
had,	1
for	1
many	1
years,	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
habit	1
of	1
groping	1
in	1
old	1
castles,	1
and	1
in	1
moats,**	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
a	1
round	1
tower***	1
in	1
the	1
neighbourhood,	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
treasure.	1
In	1
her	1
youth	1
she	1
had	1
heard	1
someone	1
talking,	1
in	1
a	1
whisper,	1
of	1
an	1
old	1
prophecy,	1
found	1
in	1
a	1
bog,	1
which	1
said	1
that	1
before	1
many	1
"St.	1
Patrick's	1
days	1
should	1
come	1
about,	1
There	1
would	1
be	1
found	1
A	1
treasure	1
under	1
ground,	1
By	1
one	1
within	1
twenty	1
miles	1
round."	1
This	1
prophecy	1
made	1
a	1
deep	1
impression	1
upon	1
her.	1
She	1
also	1
dreamed	1
of	1
it	1
three	1
times:	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
dream,	1
she	1
thought,	1
was	1
a	1
sure	1
token	1
that	1
the	1
prophecy	1
was	1
to	1
come	1
true,	1
she,	1
from	1
that	1
time	1
forwards,	1
gave	1
up	1
her	1
spinning-wheel	1
and	1
her	1
knitting,	1
and	1
could	1
think	1
of	1
nothing	1
but	1
hunting	1
for	1
the	1
treasure,	1
that	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
by	1
one	1
"within	1
twenty	1
miles	1
round."	1

Year	1
after	1
year	1
St.	1
Patrick's	1
day	1
came	1
about,	1
without	1
her	1
ever	1
finding	1
a	1
farthing	1
by	1
all	1
her	1
groping;	1
and	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
always	1
idle,	1
she	1
grew	1
poorer	1
and	1
poorer.	1
Besides,	1
to	1
comfort	1
herself	1
for	1
her	1
disappointments,	1
and	1
to	1
give	1
her	1
spirits	1
for	1
fresh	1
searches,	1
she	1
took	1
to	1
drinking.	1
She	1
sold	1
all	1
she	1
had	1
by	1
degrees;	1
but	1
still	1
she	1
fancied	1
that	1
the	1
lucky	1
day	1
would	1
come	1
sooner	1
or	1
later,	1
THAT	1
WOULD	1
PAY	1
FOR	1
ALL.	1
Goody	1
Grope,	1
however,	1
reached	1
her	1
sixtieth	1
year,	1
without	1
ever	1
seeing	1
this	1
lucky	1
day;	1
and	1
now,	1
in	1
her	1
old	1
age,	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
beggar,	1
without	1
a	1
house	1
to	1
shelter	1
her,	1
a	1
bed	1
to	1
lie	1
on,	1
or	1
food	1
to	1
put	1
into	1
her	1
mouth,	1
but	1
what	1
she	1
begged	1
from	1
the	1
charity	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
trusted	1
more	1
than	1
she	1
had	1
to	1
industry	1
and	1
less	1
to	1
LUCK.	1
"Ah,	1
Mary,	1
honey!	1
give	1
me	1
a	1
potato	1
and	1
a	1
sup	1
of	1
something,	1
for	1
the	1
love	1
o'	1
mercy;	1
for	1
not	1
a	1
bit	1
have	1
I	1
had	1
all	1
day,	1
except	1
half	1
a	1
glass	1
of	1
whisky	1
and	1
a	1
halfpenny	1
worth	1
of	1
tobacco!"	1
Mary	1
immediately	1
set	1
before	1
her	1
some	1
milk,	1
and	1
picked	1
a	1
good	1
potato	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
bowl	1
for	1
her.	1
She	1
was	1
sorry	1
to	1
see	1
such	1
an	1
old	1
woman	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
wretched	1
condition.	1
Goody	1
Grope	1
said	1
she	1
would	1
rather	1
have	1
spirits	1
of	1
some	1
kind	1
or	1
other	1
than	1
milk;	1
but	1
Mary	1
had	1
no	1
spirits	1
to	1
give	1
her;	1
so	1
she	1
sat	1
herself	1
down	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
fire,	1
and	1
after	1
she	1
had	1
sighed	1
and	1
groaned	1
and	1
smoked	1
for	1
some	1
time,	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
Mary,	1
"Well,	1
and	1
what	1
have	1
you	1
done	1
with	1
the	1
treasure	1
you	1
had	1
the	1
luck	1
to	1
find?"	1
Mary	1
told	1
her	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
carried	1
it	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Hopkins,	1
the	1
agent.	1
"That's	1
not	1
what	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
done	1
in	1
your	1
place,"	1
replied	1
the	1
old	1
woman.	1
"When	1
good	1
luck	1
came	1
to	1
you,	1
what	1
a	1
shame	1
to	1
turn	1
your	1
back	1
upon	1
it!	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
idle	1
talking	1
of	1
what's	1
done--that's	1
past;	1
but	1
I'll	1
try	1
my	1
luck	1
in	1
this	1
here	1
castle	1
before	1
next	1
St.	1
Patrick's	1
day	1
comes	1
about.	1
I	1
was	1
told	1
it	1
was	1
more	1
than	1
twenty	1
miles	1
from	1
our	1
bog	1
or	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
here	1
long	1
ago;	1
but	1
better	1
late	1
than	1
never."	1
Mary	1
was	1
much	1
alarmed,	1
and	1
not	1
without	1
reason,	1
at	1
this	1
speech;	1
for	1
she	1
knew	1
that	1
if	1
Goody	1
Grope	1
once	1
set	1
to	1
work	1
at	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
castle	1
of	1
Rossmore,	1
she	1
would	1
soon	1
bring	1
it	1
all	1
down.	1
It	1
was	1
in	1
vain	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
Goody	1
Grope	1
of	1
the	1
danger	1
of	1
burying	1
herself	1
under	1
the	1
ruins,	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
improbability	1
of	1
her	1
meeting	1
with	1
another	1
pot	1
of	1
gold	1
coins.	1
She	1
set	1
her	1
elbow	1
upon	1
her	1
knees,	1
and	1
stopping	1
her	1
ears	1
with	1
her	1
hands	1
bid	1
Mary	1
and	1
her	1
sisters	1
not	1
to	1
waste	1
their	1
breath	1
advising	1
their	1
elders;	1
for	1
that,	1
let	1
them	1
say	1
what	1
they	1
would,	1
she	1
would	1
fall	1
to	1
work	1
the	1
next	1
morning,	1
"BARRING	1
you'll	1
make	1
it	1
worth	1
my	1
while	1
to	1
let	1
it	1
alone."	1
"And	1
what	1
will	1
make	1
it	1
worth	1
your	1
while	1
to	1
let	1
it	1
alone?"	1
said	1
Mary;	1
for	1
she	1
saw	1
that	1
she	1
must	1
either	1
get	1
into	1
a	1
quarrel	1
or	1
give	1
up	1
her	1
habitation,	1
or	1
comply	1
with	1
the	1
conditions	1
of	1
this	1
provoking	1
old	1
woman.	1
Half	1
a	1
crown,	1
Goody	1
Grope	1
said,	1
was	1
the	1
least	1
she	1
could	1
be	1
content	1
to	1
take.	1
Mary	1
paid	1
the	1
half-crown,	1
and	1
was	1
in	1
hopes	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
got	1
rid	1
for	1
ever	1
of	1
her	1
tormentor,	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
mistaken,	1
for	1
scarcely	1
was	1
the	1
week	1
at	1
an	1
end	1
before	1
the	1
old	1
woman	1
appeared	1
before	1
her	1
again,	1
and	1
repeated	1
her	1
threats	1
of	1
falling	1
to	1
work	1
the	1
next	1
morning,	1
unless	1
she	1
had	1
something	1
given	1
to	1
her	1
to	1
buy	1
tobacco.	1
The	1
next	1
day	1
and	1
the	1
next,	1
and	1
the	1
next,	1
Goody	1
Grope	1
came	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
errand,	1
and	1
poor	1
Mary,	1
who	1
could	1
ill-afford	1
to	1
supply	1
her	1
constantly	1
with	1
halfpence,	1
at	1
last	1
exclaimed,	1
"I	1
am	1
sure	1
the	1
finding	1
of	1
this	1
treasure	1
has	1
not	1
been	1
any	1
good	1
luck	1
to	1
us,	1
but	1
quite	1
the	1
contrary;	1
and	1
I	1
wish	1
we	1
never	1
had	1
found	1
it."	1
Mary	1
did	1
not	1
yet	1
know	1
how	1
much	1
she	1
was	1
to	1
suffer	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
this	1
unfortunate	1
pot	1
of	1
gold	1
coins.	1
Mr.	1
Hopkins,	1
the	1
agent,	1
imagined	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
knew	1
of	1
the	1
discovery	1
of	1
this	1
treasure	1
but	1
himself	1
and	1
these	1
poor	1
children;	1
so,	1
not	1
being	1
as	1
honest	1
as	1
they	1
were,	1
he	1
resolved	1
to	1
keep	1
it	1
for	1
his	1
own	1
use.	1
He	1
was	1
surprised	1
some	1
weeks	1
afterwards	1
to	1
receive	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
his	1
employer,	1
Mr.	1
Harvey,	1
demanding	1
from	1
him	1
the	1
coins	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
discovered	1
at	1
Rossmore	1
Castle.	1
Hopkins	1
had	1
sold	1
the	1
gold	1
coins,	1
and	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
others;	1
and	1
he	1
flattered	1
himself	1
that	1
the	1
children,	1
and	1
the	1
young	1
ladies,	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
now	1
found	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
shown,	1
could	1
not	1
tell	1
whether	1
what	1
they	1
had	1
seen	1
were	1
gold	1
or	1
not,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
apprehensive	1
that	1
those	1
of	1
Henry	1
the	1
Seventh's	1
reign	1
should	1
be	1
reclaimed	1
from	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
thought	1
they	1
had	1
escaped	1
attention.	1
So	1
he	1
sent	1
over	1
the	1
silver	1
coins	1
and	1
others	1
of	1
little	1
value,	1
and	1
apologized	1
for	1
his	1
not	1
having	1
mentioned	1
them	1
before,	1
by	1
saying	1
that	1
he	1
considered	1
them	1
as	1
mere	1
rubbish.	1
Mr.	1
Harvey,	1
in	1
reply,	1
observed	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
consider	1
as	1
rubbish	1
the	1
gold	1
coins	1
which	1
were	1
amongst	1
them	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
discovered;	1
and	1
he	1
inquired	1
why	1
these	1
gold	1
coins,	1
and	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
Henry	1
the	1
Seventh,	1
were	1
not	1
now	1
sent	1
to	1
him.	1
Mr.	1
Hopkins	1
denied	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
ever	1
received	1
any	1
such;	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
thunderstruck	1
when	1
Mr.	1
Harvey,	1
in	1
reply	1
to	1
this	1
falsehood,	1
sent	1
him	1
a	1
list	1
of	1
the	1
coins	1
which	1
the	1
orphans	1
had	1
deposited	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
exact	1
drawings	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
were	1
missing.	1
He	1
informed	1
him	1
that	1
this	1
list	1
and	1
these	1
drawings	1
came	1
from	1
two	1
ladies	1
who	1
had	1
seen	1
the	1
coins	1
in	1
question.	1
Mr.	1
Hopkins	1
thought	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
means	1
of	1
escape	1
but	1
by	1
boldly	1
persisting	1
in	1
falsehood.	1
He	1
replied,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
very	1
likely	1
such	1
coins	1
had	1
been	1
found	1
at	1
Rossmore	1
Castle,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
ladies	1
alluded	1
to	1
had	1
probably	1
seen	1
them;	1
but	1
he	1
positively	1
declared	1
that	1
they	1
never	1
came	1
to	1
his	1
hands;	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
restored	1
all	1
that	1
were	1
deposited	1
with	1
him;	1
and	1
that,	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
others,	1
he	1
supposed	1
they	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
taken	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
pot	1
by	1
the	1
children,	1
or	1
by	1
Edmund	1
or	1
Mary	1
on	1
their	1
way	1
from	1
the	1
ladies'	1
house	1
to	1
his.	1
The	1
orphans	1
were	1
shocked	1
and	1
astonished	1
when	1
they	1
heard,	1
from	1
Isabella	1
and	1
Caroline,	1
the	1
charge	1
that	1
was	1
made	1
against	1
them.	1
They	1
looked	1
at	1
one	1
another	1
in	1
silence	1
for	1
some	1
moments.	1
Then	1
Peggy	1
exclaimed--"Sure!	1
Mr.	1
Hopkins	1
has	1
forgotten	1
himself	1
strangely.	1
Does	1
not	1
he	1
remember	1
Edmund's	1
counting	1
the	1
things	1
to	1
him	1
upon	1
the	1
great	1
table	1
in	1
his	1
hall,	1
and	1
we	1
all	1
standing	1
by!	1
I	1
remember	1
it	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
was	1
this	1
instant."	1
"And	1
so	1
do	1
I,"	1
cried	1
Anne.	1
"And	1
don't	1
you	1
recollect,	1
Mary,	1
your	1
picking	1
out	1
the	1
gold	1
ones,	1
and	1
telling	1
Mr.	1
Hopkins	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
gold;	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
you	1
knew	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
matter;	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
tell	1
him	1
that	1
Miss	1
Isabella	1
had	1
tried	1
them,	1
and	1
knew	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
gold?	1
but	1
just	1
then	1
there	1
came	1
in	1
some	1
tenants	1
to	1
pay	1
their	1
rent,	1
and	1
he	1
pushed	1
us	1
out,	1
and	1
twitched	1
from	1
my	1
hand	1
the	1
piece	1
of	1
gold	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
taken	1
up	1
to	1
show	1
him	1
the	1
bright	1
spot	1
which	1
Miss	1
Isabella	1
had	1
cleaned	1
by	1
the	1
stuff	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
poured	1
on	1
it?	1
I	1
believe	1
he	1
was	1
afraid	1
I	1
should	1
steal	1
it;	1
he	1
twitched	1
it	1
from	1
my	1
hand	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
hurry.	1
Do,	1
Edmund;	1
do,	1
Mary--let	1
us	1
go	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
put	1
him	1
in	1
mind	1
of	1
all	1
this."	1
"I'll	1
go	1
to	1
him	1
no	1
more,"	1
said	1
Edmund,	1
sturdily.	1
"He	1
is	1
a	1
bad	1
man--I'll	1
never	1
go	1
to	1
him	1
again.	1
Mary,	1
don't	1
be	1
cast	1
down--we	1
have	1
no	1
need	1
to	1
be	1
cast	1
down--we	1
are	1
honest."	1
"True,"	1
said	1
Mary;	1
"but	1
is	1
not	1
it	1
a	1
hard	1
case	1
that	1
we,	1
who	1
have	1
lived,	1
as	1
my	1
mother	1
did	1
all	1
her	1
life	1
before	1
us,	1
in	1
peace	1
and	1
honesty	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
world,	1
should	1
now	1
have	1
our	1
good	1
name	1
taken	1
from	1
us,	1
when--"	1
Mary's	1
voice	1
faltered	1
and	1
stopped.	1
"It	1
can't	1
be	1
taken	1
from	1
us,"	1
cried	1
Edmund,	1
"poor	1
orphans	1
though	1
we	1
are,	1
and	1
he	1
a	1
rich	1
gentleman,	1
as	1
he	1
calls	1
himself.	1
Let	1
him	1
say	1
and	1
do	1
what	1
he	1
will,	1
he	1
can't	1
hurt	1
our	1
good	1
name."	1
Edmund	1
was	1
mistaken,	1
alas!	1
and	1
Mary	1
had	1
but	1
too	1
much	1
reason	1
for	1
her	1
fears.	1
The	1
affair	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
talked	1
of;	1
and	1
the	1
agent	1
spared	1
no	1
pains	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
story	1
told	1
his	1
own	1
way.	1
The	1
orphans,	1
conscious	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
innocence,	1
took	1
no	1
pains	1
about	1
the	1
matter;	1
and	1
the	1
consequence	1
was,	1
that	1
all	1
who	1
knew	1
them	1
well	1
had	1
no	1
doubt	1
of	1
their	1
honesty;	1
but	1
many,	1
who	1
knew	1
nothing	1
of	1
them,	1
concluded	1
that	1
the	1
agent	1
must	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
right	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
in	1
the	1
wrong.	1
The	1
buzz	1
of	1
scandal	1
went	1
on	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
without	1
reaching	1
their	1
ears,	1
because	1
they	1
lived	1
very	1
retiredly.	1
But	1
one	1
day,	1
when	1
Mary	1
went	1
to	1
sell	1
some	1
stockings	1
of	1
Peggy's	1
knitting	1
at	1
the	1
neighbouring	1
fair,	1
the	1
man	1
to	1
whom	1
she	1
sold	1
them	1
bid	1
her	1
write	1
her	1
name	1
on	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
a	1
note,	1
and	1
exclaimed,	1
on	1
seeing	1
it--"Ho!	1
ho!	1
mistress;	1
I'd	1
not	1
have	1
had	1
any	1
dealings	1
with	1
you,	1
had	1
I	1
known	1
your	1
name	1
sooner.	1
Where's	1
the	1
gold	1
that	1
you	1
found	1
at	1
Rossmore	1
Castle?"	1
It	1
was	1
in	1
vain	1
that	1
Mary	1
related	1
the	1
fact.	1
She	1
saw	1
that	1
she	1
gained	1
no	1
belief,	1
as	1
her	1
character	1
was	1
not	1
known	1
to	1
this	1
man,	1
or	1
to	1
any	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
present.	1
She	1
left	1
the	1
fair	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
could;	1
and	1
though	1
she	1
struggled	1
against	1
it,	1
she	1
felt	1
very	1
melancholy.	1
Still	1
she	1
exerted	1
herself	1
every	1
day	1
at	1
her	1
little	1
manufacture;	1
and	1
she	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
console	1
herself	1
by	1
reflecting	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
two	1
friends	1
left	1
who	1
would	1
not	1
give	1
up	1
her	1
character,	1
and	1
who	1
continued	1
steadily	1
to	1
protect	1
her	1
and	1
her	1
sisters.	1
Isabella	1
and	1
Caroline	1
everywhere	1
asserted	1
their	1
belief	1
in	1
the	1
integrity	1
of	1
the	1
orphans,	1
but	1
to	1
prove	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
this	1
instance	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
power.	1
Mr.	1
Hopkins,	1
the	1
agent,	1
and	1
his	1
friends,	1
constantly	1
repeated	1
that	1
the	1
gold	1
coins	1
were	1
taken	1
away	1
in	1
coming	1
from	1
their	1
house	1
to	1
his;	1
and	1
these	1
ladies	1
were	1
blamed	1
by	1
many	1
people	1
for	1
continuing	1
to	1
countenance	1
those	1
that	1
were,	1
with	1
great	1
reason,	1
suspected	1
to	1
be	1
thieves.	1
The	1
orphans	1
were	1
in	1
a	1
worse	1
condition	1
than	1
ever	1
when	1
the	1
winter	1
came	1
on,	1
and	1
their	1
benefactresses	1
left	1
the	1
country	1
to	1
spend	1
some	1
months	1
in	1
Dublin.	1
The	1
old	1
castle,	1
it	1
was	1
true,	1
was	1
likely	1
to	1
last	1
through	1
the	1
winter,	1
as	1
the	1
mason	1
said;	1
but	1
though	1
the	1
want	1
of	1
a	1
comfortable	1
house	1
to	1
live	1
in	1
was,	1
a	1
little	1
while	1
ago,	1
the	1
uppermost	1
thing	1
in	1
Mary's	1
thoughts,	1
now	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
so.	1
One	1
night	1
as	1
Mary	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
bed,	1
she	1
heard	1
someone	1
knocking	1
hard	1
at	1
the	1
door.	1
"Mary,	1
are	1
you	1
up?	1
let	1
us	1
in,"	1
cried	1
a	1
voice,	1
which	1
she	1
knew	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
Betsy	1
Green,	1
the	1
postmaster's	1
daughter,	1
who	1
lived	1
in	1
the	1
village	1
near	1
them.	1
She	1
let	1
Betsy	1
in,	1
and	1
asked	1
what	1
she	1
could	1
want	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
time	1
of	1
night.	1
"Give	1
me	1
sixpence,	1
and	1
I'll	1
tell	1
you,"	1
said	1
Betsy;	1
"but	1
waken	1
Anne	1
and	1
Peggy.	1
Here's	1
a	1
letter	1
just	1
come	1
by	1
post	1
for	1
you,	1
and	1
I	1
stepped	1
over	1
to	1
you	1
with	1
it;	1
because	1
I	1
guessed	1
you'd	1
be	1
glad	1
to	1
have	1
it,	1
seeing	1
it	1
is	1
your	1
brother's	1
handwriting."	1
Peggy	1
and	1
Anne	1
were	1
soon	1
roused,	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
Edmund.	1
It	1
was	1
by	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
rush	1
candles	1
that	1
Mary	1
read	1
it;	1
and	1
the	1
letter	1
was	1
as	1
follows:--	1
"DEAR	1
MARY,	1
NANCY,	1
AND	1
LITTLE	1
PEG,--	1
"Joy!	1
joy!--I	1
always	1
said	1
the	1
truth	1
would	1
come	1
out	1
at	1
last;	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
take	1
our	1
good	1
name	1
from	1
us.	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
tell	1
you	1
how	1
it	1
all	1
came	1
about	1
till	1
we	1
meet,	1
which	1
will	1
be	1
next	1
week,	1
as	1
we	1
are	1
(I	1
mean,	1
master	1
and	1
mistress,	1
and	1
the	1
young	1
ladies--bless	1
them!--and	1
Mr.	1
Gilbert	1
and	1
I)	1
coming	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
vicarage	1
to	1
keep	1
Christmas;	1
and	1
a	1
happy	1
Christmas	1
'tis	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
for	1
honest	1
folks.	1
As	1
for	1
they	1
that	1
are	1
not	1
honest,	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
for	1
them	1
to	1
expect	1
to	1
be	1
happy,	1
at	1
Christmas,	1
or	1
any	1
other	1
time.	1
You	1
shall	1
know	1
all	1
when	1
we	1
meet.	1
So,	1
till	1
then,	1
fare	1
ye	1
well,	1
dear	1
Mary,	1
Nancy,	1
and	1
little	1
Peg.	1
"Your	1
joyful	1
and	1
affectionate	1
brother,	1
EDMUND."	1
To	1
comprehend	1
why	1
Edmund	1
is	1
joyful,	1
our	1
readers	1
must	1
be	1
informed	1
of	1
certain	1
things	1
which	1
happened	1
after	1
Isabella	1
and	1
Caroline	1
went	1
to	1
Dublin.	1
One	1
morning	1
they	1
went	1
with	1
their	1
father	1
and	1
mother	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
magnificent	1
library	1
of	1
a	1
nobleman,	1
who	1
took	1
generous	1
and	1
polite	1
pleasure	1
in	1
thus	1
sharing	1
the	1
advantages	1
of	1
his	1
wealth	1
and	1
station	1
with	1
all	1
who	1
had	1
any	1
pretensions	1
to	1
science	1
or	1
literature.	1
Knowing	1
that	1
the	1
gentleman	1
who	1
was	1
now	1
come	1
to	1
see	1
his	1
library	1
was	1
skilled	1
in	1
antiquities,	1
the	1
nobleman	1
opened	1
a	1
drawer	1
of	1
medals,	1
to	1
ask	1
his	1
opinion	1
concerning	1
the	1
age	1
of	1
some	1
coins,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
lately	1
purchased	1
at	1
a	1
high	1
price.	1
They	1
were	1
the	1
very	1
same	1
which	1
the	1
orphans	1
had	1
found	1
at	1
Rossmore	1
Castle.	1
Isabella	1
and	1
Caroline	1
knew	1
them	1
again	1
instantly;	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
cross	1
which	1
Isabella	1
had	1
made	1
on	1
each	1
of	1
them	1
was	1
still	1
visible	1
through	1
a	1
magnifying	1
glass,	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
no	1
possibility	1
of	1
doubt.	1
The	1
nobleman,	1
who	1
was	1
much	1
interested	1
both	1
by	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
these	1
orphans,	1
and	1
the	1
manner	1
in	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
told	1
to	1
him,	1
sent	1
immediately	1
for	1
the	1
person	1
from	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
purchased	1
the	1
coins.	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
Jew	1
broker.	1
At	1
first	1
he	1
refused	1
to	1
tell	1
them	1
from	1
whom	1
he	1
got	1
them,	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
bought	1
them,	1
he	1
said,	1
under	1
a	1
promise	1
of	1
secrecy.	1
Being	1
further	1
pressed,	1
he	1
acknowledged	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
made	1
a	1
condition	1
in	1
his	1
bargain	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
not	1
sell	1
them	1
to	1
anyone	1
in	1
Ireland,	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
tempted	1
by	1
the	1
high	1
price	1
the	1
present	1
noble	1
possessor	1
had	1
offered.	1
At	1
last,	1
when	1
the	1
Jew	1
was	1
informed	1
that	1
the	1
coins	1
were	1
stolen,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
proceeded	1
against	1
as	1
a	1
receiver	1
of	1
stolen	1
goods,	1
if	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
confess	1
the	1
whole	1
truth,	1
he	1
declared	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
purchased	1
them	1
from	1
a	1
gentleman,	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
before	1
or	1
since;	1
but	1
he	1
added,	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
swear	1
to	1
his	1
person,	1
if	1
he	1
saw	1
him	1
again.	1
Now,	1
Mr.	1
Hopkins,	1
the	1
agent,	1
was	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
in	1
Dublin,	1
and	1
Caroline's	1
father	1
posted	1
the	1
Jew,	1
the	1
next	1
day,	1
in	1
the	1
back-parlour	1
of	1
a	1
banker's	1
house,	1
with	1
whom	1
Mr.	1
Hopkins	1
had,	1
on	1
this	1
day,	1
appointed	1
to	1
settle	1
some	1
accounts.	1
Mr.	1
Hopkins	1
came--the	1
Jew	1
knew	1
him--swore	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
sold	1
the	1
coins	1
to	1
him;	1
and	1
thus	1
the	1
guilt	1
of	1
the	1
agent	1
and	1
the	1
innocence	1
of	1
the	1
orphans	1
were	1
completely	1
proved.	1
A	1
full	1
account	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
happened	1
was	1
sent	1
to	1
England	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Harvey,	1
their	1
landlord,	1
and	1
a	1
few	1
posts	1
afterwards	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
him,	1
containing	1
a	1
dismissal	1
of	1
the	1
dishonest	1
agent,	1
and	1
a	1
reward	1
for	1
the	1
honest	1
and	1
industrious	1
orphans.	1
Mr.	1
Harvey	1
desired	1
that	1
Mary	1
and	1
her	1
sisters	1
might	1
have	1
the	1
slated	1
house,	1
rent	1
free,	1
from	1
this	1
time	1
forward,	1
under	1
the	1
care	1
of	1
ladies	1
Isabella	1
and	1
Caroline,	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
Mary	1
or	1
her	1
sisters	1
should	1
carry	1
on	1
in	1
it	1
any	1
useful	1
business.	1
This	1
was	1
the	1
joyful	1
news	1
which	1
Edmund	1
had	1
to	1
tell	1
his	1
sisters.	1
All	1
the	1
neighbours	1
shared	1
in	1
their	1
joy,	1
and	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
their	1
removal	1
from	1
the	1
ruins	1
of	1
Rossmore	1
Castle	1
to	1
their	1
new	1
house	1
was	1
the	1
happiest	1
of	1
the	1
Christmas	1
holidays.	1
They	1
were	1
not	1
envied	1
for	1
their	1
prosperity;	1
because	1
everybody	1
saw	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
reward	1
of	1
their	1
good	1
conduct;	1
everybody	1
except	1
Goody	1
Grope.	1
She	1
exclaimed,	1
as	1
she	1
wrung	1
her	1
hands	1
with	1
violent	1
expressions	1
of	1
sorrow--"Bad	1
luck	1
to	1
me!	1
bad	1
luck	1
to	1
me!--Why	1
didn't	1
I	1
go	1
sooner	1
to	1
that	1
there	1
castle?	1
It	1
is	1
all	1
luck,	1
all	1
luck	1
in	1
this	1
world;	1
but	1
I	1
never	1
had	1
no	1
luck.	1
Think	1
of	1
the	1
luck	1
of	1
these	1
childer,	1
that	1
have	1
found	1
a	1
pot	1
of	1
gold,	1
and	1
such	1
great,	1
grand	1
friends,	1
and	1
a	1
slated	1
house,	1
and	1
all:	1
and	1
here	1
am	1
I,	1
with	1
scarce	1
a	1
rag	1
to	1
cover	1
me,	1
and	1
not	1
a	1
potato	1
to	1
put	1
into	1
my	1
mouth!--I,	1
that	1
have	1
been	1
looking	1
under	1
ground	1
all	1
my	1
days	1
for	1
treasure,	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
halfpenny	1
at	1
the	1
last,	1
to	1
buy	1
me	1
tobacco!"	1
"That	1
is	1
the	1
very	1
reason	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
not	1
a	1
halfpenny,"	1
said	1
Betsy.	1
"Here	1
Mary	1
has	1
been	1
working	1
hard,	1
and	1
so	1
have	1
her	1
two	1
little	1
sisters	1
and	1
her	1
brother,	1
for	1
these	1
five	1
years	1
past;	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
made	1
money	1
for	1
themselves	1
by	1
their	1
own	1
industry--and	1
friends	1
too--not	1
by	1
luck,	1
but	1
by--"	1
"Phoo!	1
phoo!"	1
interrupted	1
Goody	1
Grope;	1
"don't	1
be	1
prating;	1
don't	1
I	1
know	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
you	1
do,	1
that	1
they	1
found	1
a	1
pot	1
of	1
gold,	1
BY	1
GOOD	1
LUCK?	1
and	1
is	1
not	1
that	1
the	1
cause	1
why	1
they	1
are	1
going	1
to	1
live	1
in	1
a	1
slated	1
house	1
now?"	1
"No,"	1
replied	1
the	1
postmaster's	1
daughter;	1
"this	1
house	1
is	1
given	1
to	1
them	1
AS	1
A	1
REWARD--that	1
was	1
the	1
word	1
in	1
the	1
letter;	1
for	1
I	1
saw	1
it.	1
Edmund	1
showed	1
it	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
will	1
show	1
it	1
to	1
anyone	1
that	1
wants	1
to	1
see.	1
This	1
house	1
was	1
given	1
to	1
them	1
'AS	1
A	1
REWARD	1
FOR	1
THEIR	1
HONESTY.'"	1
LAZY	1
LAWRENCE.	1
In	1
the	1
pleasant	1
valley	1
of	1
Ashton	1
there	1
lived	1
an	1
elderly	1
woman	1
of	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Preston.	1
She	1
had	1
a	1
small	1
neat	1
cottage,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
weed	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
in	1
her	1
garden.	1
It	1
was	1
upon	1
her	1
garden	1
that	1
she	1
chiefly	1
depended	1
for	1
support;	1
it	1
consisted	1
of	1
strawberry	1
beds,	1
and	1
one	1
small	1
border	1
for	1
flowers.	1
The	1
pinks	1
and	1
roses	1
she	1
tied	1
up	1
in	1
nice	1
nosegays,	1
and	1
sent	1
either	1
to	1
Clifton	1
or	1
Bristol	1
to	1
be	1
sold.	1
As	1
to	1
her	1
strawberries,	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
send	1
them	1
to	1
market,	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
custom	1
for	1
numbers	1
of	1
people	1
to	1
come	1
from	1
Clifton,	1
in	1
the	1
summer	1
time,	1
to	1
eat	1
strawberries	1
and	1
cream	1
at	1
the	1
gardens	1
in	1
Ashton.	1
Now,	1
the	1
widow	1
Preston	1
was	1
so	1
obliging,	1
active	1
and	1
good-humoured,	1
that	1
everyone	1
who	1
came	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
was	1
pleased.	1
She	1
lived	1
happily	1
in	1
this	1
manner	1
for	1
several	1
years;	1
but,	1
alas!	1
one	1
autumn	1
she	1
fell	1
sick,	1
and,	1
during	1
her	1
illness,	1
everything	1
went	1
wrong;	1
her	1
garden	1
was	1
neglected,	1
her	1
cow	1
died,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
money	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
saved	1
was	1
spent	1
in	1
paying	1
for	1
medicines.	1
The	1
winter	1
passed	1
away,	1
while	1
she	1
was	1
so	1
weak	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
earn	1
but	1
little	1
by	1
her	1
work;	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
summer	1
came,	1
her	1
rent	1
was	1
called	1
for,	1
and	1
the	1
rent	1
was	1
not	1
ready	1
in	1
her	1
little	1
purse	1
as	1
usual.	1
She	1
begged	1
a	1
few	1
months'	1
delay,	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
granted	1
to	1
her;	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
that	1
time	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
resource	1
but	1
to	1
sell	1
her	1
horse	1
Lightfoot.	1
Now	1
Lightfoot,	1
though	1
perhaps	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
his	1
best	1
days,	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
great	1
favourite.	1
In	1
his	1
youth	1
he	1
had	1
always	1
carried	1
the	1
dame	1
to	1
the	1
market	1
behind	1
her	1
husband;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
now	1
her	1
little	1
son	1
Jem's	1
turn	1
to	1
ride	1
him.	1
It	1
was	1
Jem's	1
business	1
to	1
feed	1
Lightfoot,	1
and	1
to	1
take	1
care	1
of	1
him--a	1
charge	1
which	1
he	1
never	1
neglected,	1
for,	1
besides	1
being	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
natured,	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
industrious	1
boy.	1
"It	1
will	1
go	1
near	1
to	1
break	1
my	1
Jem's	1
heart,"	1
said	1
Dame	1
Preston	1
to	1
herself,	1
as	1
she	1
sat	1
one	1
evening	1
beside	1
the	1
fire	1
stirring	1
the	1
embers,	1
and	1
considering	1
how	1
she	1
had	1
best	1
open	1
the	1
matter	1
to	1
her	1
son,	1
who	1
stood	1
opposite	1
to	1
her,	1
eating	1
a	1
dry	1
crust	1
of	1
bread	1
very	1
heartily	1
for	1
supper.	1
"Jem,"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
woman,	1
"what,	1
ar't	1
hungry?"	1
"That	1
I	1
am,	1
brave	1
and	1
hungry!"	1
"Ay!	1
no	1
wonder,	1
you've	1
been	1
brave	1
hard	1
at	1
work--Eh?"	1
"Brave	1
hard!	1
I	1
wish	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
dark,	1
mother,	1
that	1
you	1
might	1
just	1
step	1
out	1
and	1
see	1
the	1
great	1
bed	1
I've	1
dug;	1
I	1
know	1
you'd	1
say	1
it	1
was	1
no	1
bad	1
day's	1
work--and	1
oh,	1
mother!	1
I've	1
good	1
news:	1
Farmer	1
Truck	1
will	1
give	1
us	1
the	1
giant	1
strawberries,	1
and	1
I'm	1
to	1
go	1
for	1
'em	1
tomorrow	1
morning,	1
and	1
I'll	1
be	1
back	1
afore	1
breakfast."	1
"God	1
bless	1
the	1
boy!	1
how	1
he	1
talks!--Four	1
mile	1
there,	1
and	1
four	1
mile	1
back	1
again,	1
afore	1
breakfast."	1
"Ay,	1
upon	1
Lightfoot,	1
you	1
know,	1
mother,	1
very	1
easily;	1
mayn't	1
I?"	1
"Ay,	1
child!"	1
"Why	1
do	1
you	1
sigh,	1
mother?"	1
"Finish	1
thy	1
supper,	1
child."	1
"I've	1
done!"	1
cried	1
Jem,	1
swallowing	1
the	1
last	1
mouthful	1
hastily,	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
thought	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
too	1
long	1
at	1
supper--"and	1
now	1
for	1
the	1
great	1
needle;	1
I	1
must	1
see	1
and	1
mend	1
Lightfoot's	1
bridle	1
afore	1
I	1
go	1
to	1
bed."	1
To	1
work	1
he	1
set,	1
by	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
fire,	1
and	1
the	1
dame	1
having	1
once	1
more	1
stirred	1
it,	1
began	1
again	1
with	1
"Jem,	1
dear,	1
does	1
he	1
go	1
lame	1
at	1
all	1
now?"	1
"What,	1
Lightfoot!	1
Oh,	1
la,	1
no,	1
not	1
he--never	1
was	1
so	1
well	1
of	1
his	1
lameness	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
life.	1
He's	1
grown	1
quite	1
young	1
again,	1
I	1
think,	1
and	1
then	1
he's	1
so	1
fat	1
he	1
can	1
hardly	1
wag."	1
"God	1
bless	1
him--that's	1
right.	1
We	1
must	1
see,	1
Jem,	1
and	1
keep	1
him	1
fat."	1
"For	1
what,	1
mother?"	1
"For	1
Monday	1
fortnight	1
at	1
the	1
fair.	1
He's	1
to	1
be--sold!"	1
"Lightfoot!"	1
cried	1
Jem,	1
and	1
let	1
the	1
bridle	1
fall	1
from	1
his	1
hand;	1
"and	1
WILL	1
mother	1
sell	1
Lightfoot?"	1
"WILL?	1
no:	1
but	1
I	1
MUST,	1
Jem."	1
"MUST!	1
who	1
says	1
you	1
MUST?	1
why	1
MUST	1
you,	1
mother?"	1
"I	1
must,	1
I	1
say,	1
child.	1
Why,	1
must	1
not	1
I	1
pay	1
my	1
debts	1
honestly;	1
and	1
must	1
not	1
I	1
pay	1
my	1
rent,	1
and	1
was	1
not	1
it	1
called	1
for	1
long	1
and	1
long	1
ago;	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
I	1
had	1
time;	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
I	1
promise	1
to	1
pay	1
it	1
for	1
certain	1
Monday	1
fortnight,	1
and	1
am	1
not	1
I	1
two	1
guineas	1
short;	1
and	1
where	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
get	1
two	1
guineas?	1
So	1
what	1
signifies	1
talking,	1
child?"	1
said	1
the	1
widow,	1
leaning	1
her	1
head	1
upon	1
her	1
arm.	1
"Lightfoot	1
MUST	1
go."	1
Jem	1
was	1
silent	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
minutes--"Two	1
guineas,	1
that's	1
a	1
great,	1
great	1
deal.	1
If	1
I	1
worked,	1
and	1
worked,	1
and	1
worked	1
ever	1
so	1
hard,	1
I	1
could	1
no	1
ways	1
earn	1
two	1
guineas	1
AFORE	1
Monday	1
fortnight--could	1
I,	1
mother?"	1
"Lord	1
help	1
thee,	1
no;	1
not	1
an'	1
work	1
thyself	1
to	1
death."	1
"But	1
I	1
could	1
earn	1
something,	1
though,	1
I	1
say,"	1
cried	1
Jem,	1
proudly;	1
"and	1
I	1
WILL	1
earn	1
SOMETHING--if	1
it	1
be	1
ever	1
so	1
little,	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
SOMETHING--and	1
I	1
shall	1
do	1
my	1
very	1
best;	1
so	1
I	1
will."	1
"That	1
I'm	1
sure	1
of,	1
my	1
child,"	1
said	1
his	1
mother,	1
drawing	1
him	1
towards	1
her	1
and	1
kissing	1
him;	1
"you	1
were	1
always	1
a	1
good,	1
industrious	1
lad,	1
THAT	1
I	1
will	1
say	1
afore	1
your	1
face	1
or	1
behind	1
your	1
back;--but	1
it	1
won't	1
do	1
now--Lightfoot	1
MUST	1
go."	1
Jem	1
turned	1
away	1
struggling	1
to	1
hide	1
his	1
tears,	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
bed	1
without	1
saying	1
a	1
word	1
more.	1
But	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
crying	1
would	1
do	1
no	1
good;	1
so	1
he	1
presently	1
wiped	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
lay	1
awake,	1
considering	1
what	1
he	1
could	1
possibly	1
do	1
to	1
save	1
the	1
horse.	1
"If	1
I	1
get	1
ever	1
so	1
little,"	1
he	1
still	1
said	1
to	1
himself,	1
"it	1
will	1
be	1
SOMETHING;	1
and	1
who	1
knows	1
but	1
landlord	1
might	1
then	1
wait	1
a	1
bit	1
longer?	1
and	1
we	1
might	1
make	1
it	1
all	1
up	1
in	1
time;	1
for	1
a	1
penny	1
a	1
day	1
might	1
come	1
to	1
two	1
guineas	1
in	1
time."	1
But	1
how	1
to	1
get	1
the	1
first	1
penny	1
was	1
the	1
question.	1
Then	1
he	1
recollected	1
that	1
one	1
day,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
sent	1
to	1
Clifton	1
to	1
sell	1
some	1
flowers,	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
an	1
old	1
woman	1
with	1
a	1
board	1
beside	1
her	1
covered	1
with	1
various	1
sparkling	1
stones,	1
which	1
people	1
stopped	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
as	1
they	1
passed,	1
and	1
he	1
remembered	1
that	1
some	1
people	1
bought	1
the	1
stones;	1
one	1
paid	1
twopence,	1
another	1
threepence,	1
and	1
another	1
sixpence	1
for	1
them;	1
and	1
Jem	1
heard	1
her	1
say	1
that	1
she	1
got	1
them	1
amongst	1
the	1
neighbouring	1
rocks:	1
so	1
he	1
thought	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
tried	1
he	1
might	1
find	1
some	1
too,	1
and	1
sell	1
them	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
done.	1
Early	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
he	1
wakened	1
full	1
of	1
this	1
scheme,	1
jumped	1
up,	1
dressed	1
himself,	1
and,	1
having	1
given	1
one	1
look	1
at	1
poor	1
Lightfoot	1
in	1
his	1
stable,	1
set	1
off	1
to	1
Clifton	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
woman,	1
to	1
inquire	1
where	1
she	1
found	1
her	1
sparkling	1
stones.	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
too	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
the	1
old	1
woman	1
was	1
not	1
at	1
her	1
seat;	1
so	1
he	1
turned	1
back	1
again,	1
disappointed.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
waste	1
his	1
time	1
waiting	1
for	1
her,	1
but	1
saddled	1
and	1
bridled	1
Lightfoot,	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
Farmer	1
Truck's	1
for	1
the	1
giant	1
strawberries.	1
A	1
great	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
morning	1
was	1
spent	1
in	1
putting	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
ground;	1
and,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
that	1
was	1
finished,	1
he	1
set	1
out	1
again	1
in	1
quest	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
woman,	1
whom,	1
to	1
his	1
great	1
joy,	1
he	1
spied	1
sitting	1
at	1
her	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
street	1
with	1
her	1
board	1
before	1
her.	1
But	1
this	1
old	1
woman	1
was	1
deaf	1
and	1
cross;	1
and	1
when	1
at	1
last	1
Jem	1
made	1
her	1
hear	1
his	1
questions,	1
he	1
could	1
get	1
no	1
answer	1
from	1
her,	1
but	1
that	1
she	1
found	1
the	1
fossils	1
where	1
he	1
would	1
never	1
find	1
any	1
more.	1
"But	1
can't	1
I	1
look	1
where	1
you	1
looked?"	1
"Look	1
away,	1
nobody	1
hinders	1
you,"	1
replied	1
the	1
old	1
woman;	1
and	1
these	1
were	1
the	1
only	1
words	1
she	1
would	1
say.	1
Jem	1
was	1
not,	1
however,	1
a	1
boy	1
to	1
be	1
easily	1
discouraged;	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
rocks,	1
and	1
walked	1
slowly	1
along,	1
looking	1
at	1
all	1
the	1
stones	1
as	1
he	1
passed.	1
Presently	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
place	1
where	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
men	1
were	1
at	1
work	1
loosening	1
some	1
large	1
rocks,	1
and	1
one	1
amongst	1
the	1
workmen	1
was	1
stooping	1
down	1
looking	1
for	1
something	1
very	1
eagerly;	1
Jem	1
ran	1
up,	1
and	1
asked	1
if	1
he	1
could	1
help	1
him.	1
"Yes,"	1
said	1
the	1
man,	1
"you	1
can;	1
I've	1
just	1
dropped,	1
amongst	1
this	1
heap	1
of	1
rubbish,	1
a	1
fine	1
piece	1
of	1
crystal	1
that	1
I	1
got	1
to-day."	1
"What	1
kind	1
of	1
a	1
looking	1
thing	1
is	1
it?"	1
said	1
Jem.	1
"White,	1
and	1
like	1
glass,"	1
said	1
the	1
man,	1
and	1
went	1
on	1
working	1
whilst	1
Jem	1
looked	1
very	1
carefully	1
over	1
the	1
heap	1
of	1
rubbish	1
for	1
a	1
great	1
while.	1
"Come,"	1
said	1
the	1
man,	1
"it's	1
gone	1
for	1
ever;	1
don't	1
trouble	1
yourself	1
any	1
more,	1
my	1
boy."	1
"It's	1
no	1
trouble;	1
I'll	1
look	1
a	1
little	1
longer;	1
we'll	1
not	1
give	1
it	1
up	1
so	1
soon,"	1
said	1
Jem;	1
and	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
looked	1
a	1
little	1
longer,	1
he	1
found	1
the	1
piece	1
of	1
crystal.	1
"Thank'e,"	1
said	1
the	1
man,	1
"you	1
are	1
a	1
fine	1
little	1
industrious	1
fellow."	1
Jem,	1
encouraged	1
by	1
the	1
tone	1
of	1
voice	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
man	1
spoke	1
this,	1
ventured	1
to	1
ask	1
him	1
the	1
same	1
questions	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
asked	1
the	1
old	1
woman.	1
"One	1
good	1
turn	1
deserves	1
another,"	1
said	1
the	1
man;	1
"we	1
are	1
going	1
to	1
dinner	1
just	1
now,	1
and	1
shall	1
leave	1
off	1
work--wait	1
for	1
me	1
here,	1
and	1
I'll	1
make	1
it	1
worth	1
your	1
while."	1
Jem	1
waited;	1
and,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
attentively	1
observing	1
how	1
the	1
workmen	1
went	1
on	1
with	1
their	1
work,	1
he	1
heard	1
somebody	1
near	1
him	1
give	1
a	1
great	1
yawn,	1
and,	1
turning	1
round,	1
he	1
saw	1
stretched	1
upon	1
the	1
grass,	1
beside	1
the	1
river,	1
a	1
boy	1
about	1
his	1
own	1
age,	1
who,	1
in	1
the	1
village	1
of	1
Ashton,	1
as	1
he	1
knew,	1
went	1
by	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Lazy	1
Lawrence--a	1
name	1
which	1
he	1
most	1
justly	1
deserved,	1
for	1
he	1
never	1
did	1
anything	1
from	1
morning	1
to	1
night.	1
He	1
neither	1
worked	1
nor	1
played,	1
but	1
sauntered	1
or	1
lounged	1
about	1
restless	1
and	1
yawning.	1
His	1
father	1
was	1
an	1
ale-house	1
keeper,	1
and	1
being	1
generally	1
drunk,	1
could	1
take	1
no	1
care	1
of	1
his	1
son;	1
so	1
that	1
Lazy	1
Lawrence	1
grew	1
every	1
day	1
worse	1
and	1
worse.	1
However,	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
neighbours	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
good	1
natured,	1
poor	1
fellow	1
enough,	1
and	1
would	1
never	1
do	1
anyone	1
harm	1
but	1
himself;	1
whilst	1
others,	1
who	1
were	1
wiser,	1
often	1
shook	1
their	1
heads,	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
idleness	1
was	1
the	1
root	1
of	1
all	1
evil.	1
"What,	1
Lawrence!"	1
cried	1
Jem	1
to	1
him,	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
him	1
lying	1
upon	1
the	1
grass;	1
"what,	1
are	1
you	1
asleep?"	1
"Not	1
quite."	1
"Are	1
you	1
awake?"	1
"Not	1
quite."	1
"What	1
are	1
you	1
doing	1
there?"	1
"Nothing."	1
"What	1
are	1
you	1
thinking	1
of?"	1
"Nothing."	1
"What	1
makes	1
you	1
lie	1
there?"	1
"I	1
don't	1
know--because	1
I	1
can't	1
find	1
anybody	1
to	1
play	1
with	1
me	1
to-day.	1
Will	1
you	1
come	1
and	1
play?"	1
"No,	1
I	1
can't;	1
I'm	1
busy."	1
"Busy,"	1
cried	1
Lawrence,	1
stretching	1
himself,	1
"you	1
are	1
always	1
busy.	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
you	1
for	1
the	1
world,	1
to	1
have	1
so	1
much	1
to	1
do	1
always."	1
"And	1
I,"	1
said	1
Jem,	1
laughing,	1
"would	1
not	1
be	1
you	1
for	1
the	1
world,	1
to	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
do."	1
They	1
then	1
parted,	1
for	1
the	1
workman	1
just	1
then	1
called	1
Jem	1
to	1
follow	1
him.	1
He	1
took	1
him	1
home	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
house,	1
and	1
showed	1
him	1
a	1
parcel	1
of	1
fossils,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
gathered,	1
he	1
said,	1
on	1
purpose	1
to	1
sell,	1
but	1
had	1
never	1
had	1
time	1
enough	1
to	1
sell	1
them.	1
Now,	1
however,	1
he	1
set	1
about	1
the	1
task;	1
and	1
having	1
picked	1
out	1
those	1
which	1
he	1
judged	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
best,	1
he	1
put	1
them	1
in	1
a	1
small	1
basket,	1
and	1
gave	1
them	1
to	1
Jem	1
to	1
sell,	1
upon	1
condition	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
bring	1
him	1
half	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
got.	1
Jem,	1
pleased	1
to	1
be	1
employed,	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
agree	1
to	1
what	1
the	1
man	1
proposed,	1
provided	1
his	1
mother	1
had	1
no	1
objection.	1
When	1
he	1
went	1
home	1
to	1
dinner,	1
he	1
told	1
his	1
mother	1
his	1
scheme,	1
and	1
she	1
smiled,	1
and	1
said	1
he	1
might	1
do	1
as	1
he	1
pleased;	1
for	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
afraid	1
of	1
his	1
being	1
from	1
home.	1
"You	1
are	1
not	1
an	1
idle	1
boy,"	1
said	1
she;	1
"so	1
there	1
is	1
little	1
danger	1
of	1
your	1
getting	1
into	1
any	1
mischief."	1
Accordingly	1
Jem	1
that	1
evening	1
took	1
his	1
stand,	1
with	1
his	1
little	1
basket,	1
upon	1
the	1
bank	1
of	1
the	1
river,	1
just	1
at	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
people	1
land	1
from	1
a	1
ferry-	1
boat,	1
and	1
the	1
walk	1
turns	1
to	1
the	1
wells,	1
and	1
numbers	1
of	1
people	1
perpetually	1
pass	1
to	1
drink	1
the	1
waters.	1
He	1
chose	1
his	1
place	1
well,	1
and	1
waited	1
nearly	1
all	1
the	1
evening,	1
offering	1
his	1
fossils	1
with	1
great	1
assiduity	1
to	1
every	1
passenger;	1
but	1
not	1
one	1
person	1
bought	1
any.	1
"Hallo!"	1
cried	1
some	1
sailors,	1
who	1
had	1
just	1
rowed	1
a	1
boat	1
to	1
land,	1
"bear	1
a	1
hand	1
here,	1
will	1
you,	1
my	1
little	1
fellow,	1
and	1
carry	1
these	1
parcels	1
for	1
us	1
into	1
yonder	1
house?"	1
Jem	1
ran	1
down	1
immediately	1
for	1
the	1
parcels,	1
and	1
did	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
asked	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
quickly,	1
and	1
with	1
so	1
much	1
good-will,	1
that	1
the	1
master	1
of	1
the	1
boat	1
took	1
notice	1
of	1
him,	1
and,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
away,	1
stopped	1
to	1
ask	1
him	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
got	1
in	1
his	1
little	1
basket;	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
fossils,	1
he	1
immediately	1
told	1
Jem	1
to	1
follow	1
him,	1
for	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
carry	1
some	1
shells	1
he	1
had	1
brought	1
from	1
abroad	1
to	1
a	1
lady	1
in	1
the	1
neighbourhood	1
who	1
was	1
making	1
a	1
grotto.	1
"She	1
will	1
very	1
likely	1
buy	1
your	1
stones	1
into	1
the	1
bargain.	1
Come	1
along,	1
my	1
lad;	1
we	1
can	1
but	1
try."	1
The	1
lady	1
lived	1
but	1
a	1
very	1
little	1
way	1
off,	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
soon	1
at	1
her	1
house.	1
She	1
was	1
alone	1
in	1
her	1
parlour,	1
and	1
was	1
sorting	1
a	1
bundle	1
of	1
feathers	1
of	1
different	1
colours;	1
they	1
lay	1
on	1
a	1
sheet	1
of	1
pasteboard	1
upon	1
a	1
window	1
seat,	1
and	1
it	1
happened	1
that	1
as	1
the	1
sailor	1
was	1
bustling	1
round	1
the	1
table	1
to	1
show	1
off	1
his	1
shells,	1
he	1
knocked	1
down	1
the	1
sheet	1
of	1
pasteboard,	1
and	1
scattered	1
all	1
the	1
feathers.	1
The	1
lady	1
looked	1
very	1
sorry,	1
which	1
Jem	1
observing,	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
opportunity,	1
whilst	1
she	1
was	1
busy	1
looking	1
over	1
the	1
sailor's	1
bag	1
of	1
shells,	1
to	1
gather	1
together	1
all	1
the	1
feathers,	1
and	1
sort	1
them	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
different	1
colours,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
them	1
sorted	1
when	1
he	1
first	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
room.	1
"Where	1
is	1
the	1
little	1
boy	1
you	1
brought	1
with	1
you?	1
I	1
thought	1
I	1
saw	1
him	1
here	1
just	1
now."	1
"And	1
here	1
I	1
am,	1
ma'am,"	1
cried	1
Jem,	1
creeping	1
from	1
under	1
the	1
table,	1
with	1
some	1
few	1
remaining	1
feathers	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
picked	1
from	1
the	1
carpet;	1
"I	1
thought,"	1
added	1
he,	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
others,	1
"I	1
had	1
better	1
be	1
doing	1
something	1
than	1
standing	1
idle,	1
ma'am."	1
She	1
smiled,	1
and,	1
pleased	1
with	1
his	1
activity	1
and	1
simplicity,	1
began	1
to	1
ask	1
him	1
several	1
questions;	1
such	1
as	1
who	1
he	1
was,	1
where	1
he	1
lived,	1
what	1
employment	1
he	1
had,	1
and	1
how	1
much	1
a	1
day	1
he	1
earned	1
by	1
gathering	1
fossils.	1
"This	1
is	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
I	1
ever	1
tried,"	1
said	1
Jem;	1
"I	1
never	1
sold	1
any	1
yet,	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
don't	1
buy	1
'em	1
now,	1
ma'am,	1
I'm	1
afraid	1
nobody	1
else	1
will;	1
for	1
I've	1
asked	1
everybody	1
else."	1
"Come,	1
then,"	1
said	1
the	1
lady,	1
laughing,	1
"if	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
case,	1
I	1
think	1
I	1
had	1
better	1
buy	1
them	1
all."	1
So,	1
emptying	1
all	1
the	1
fossils	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
basket,	1
she	1
put	1
half	1
a	1
crown	1
into	1
it.	1
Jem's	1
eyes	1
sparkled	1
with	1
joy.	1
"Oh,	1
thank	1
you,	1
ma'am,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"I	1
will	1
be	1
sure	1
and	1
bring	1
you	1
as	1
many	1
more,	1
to-morrow."	1
"Yes,	1
but	1
I	1
don't	1
promise	1
you,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"to	1
give	1
you	1
half	1
a	1
crown,	1
to-	1
morrow."	1
"But,	1
perhaps,	1
though	1
you	1
don't	1
promise	1
it,	1
you	1
will."	1
"No,"	1
said	1
the	1
lady,	1
"do	1
not	1
deceive	1
yourself;	1
I	1
assure	1
you	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
not.	1
THAT,	1
instead	1
of	1
encouraging	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
industrious,	1
would	1
teach	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
idle."	1
Jem	1
did	1
not	1
quite	1
understand	1
what	1
she	1
meant	1
by	1
this,	1
but	1
answered,	1
"I'm	1
sure	1
I	1
don't	1
wish	1
to	1
be	1
idle;	1
what	1
I	1
want	1
is	1
to	1
earn	1
something	1
every	1
day,	1
if	1
I	1
know	1
how;	1
I'm	1
sure	1
I	1
don't	1
wish	1
to	1
be	1
idle.	1
If	1
you	1
knew	1
all,	1
you'd	1
know	1
I	1
did	1
not."	1
"How	1
do	1
you	1
mean,	1
IF	1
I	1
KNEW	1
ALL?"	1
"Why,	1
I	1
mean,	1
if	1
you	1
knew	1
about	1
Lightfoot."	1
"Who's	1
Lightfoot?"	1
"Why,	1
mammy's	1
horse,"	1
added	1
Jem,	1
looking	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window;	1
"I	1
must	1
make	1
haste	1
home,	1
and	1
feed	1
him	1
afore	1
it	1
gets	1
dark;	1
he'll	1
wonder	1
what's	1
gone	1
with	1
me."	1
"Let	1
him	1
wonder	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
longer,"	1
said	1
the	1
lady,	1
"and	1
tell	1
me	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
your	1
story."	1
"I've	1
no	1
story,	1
ma'am,	1
to	1
tell,	1
but	1
as	1
how	1
mammy	1
says	1
he	1
must	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
fair	1
Monday	1
fortnight,	1
to	1
be	1
sold,	1
if	1
she	1
can't	1
get	1
the	1
two	1
guineas	1
for	1
her	1
rent;	1
and	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
main	1
sorry	1
to	1
part	1
with	1
him,	1
for	1
I	1
love	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
loves	1
me;	1
so	1
I'll	1
work	1
for	1
him,	1
I	1
will,	1
all	1
I	1
can.	1
To	1
be	1
sure,	1
as	1
mammy	1
says,	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
chance,	1
such	1
a	1
little	1
fellow	1
as	1
I	1
am,	1
of	1
earning	1
two	1
guineas	1
afore	1
Monday	1
fortnight."	1
"But	1
are	1
you	1
willing	1
earnestly	1
to	1
work?"	1
said	1
the	1
lady;	1
"you	1
know	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
difference	1
between	1
picking	1
up	1
a	1
few	1
stones,	1
and	1
working	1
steadily	1
every	1
day,	1
and	1
all	1
day	1
long."	1
"But,"	1
said	1
Jem,	1
"I	1
would	1
work	1
every	1
day,	1
and	1
all	1
day	1
long."	1
"Then,"	1
said	1
the	1
lady,	1
"I	1
will	1
give	1
you	1
work.	1
Come	1
here,	1
to-morrow	1
morning,	1
and	1
my	1
gardener	1
will	1
set	1
you	1
to	1
weed	1
the	1
shrubberies,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
pay	1
you	1
sixpence	1
a	1
day.	1
Remember,	1
you	1
must	1
be	1
at	1
the	1
gates	1
by	1
six	1
o'clock."	1
Jem	1
bowed,	1
thanked	1
her,	1
and	1
went	1
away.	1
It	1
was	1
late	1
in	1
the	1
evening,	1
and	1
Jem	1
was	1
impatient	1
to	1
get	1
home	1
to	1
feed	1
Lightfoot;	1
yet	1
he	1
recollected	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
promised	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
trusted	1
him	1
to	1
sell	1
the	1
fossils,	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
bring	1
him	1
half	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
got	1
for	1
them;	1
so	1
he	1
thought	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
better	1
go	1
to	1
him	1
directly;	1
and	1
away	1
he	1
went,	1
running	1
along	1
by	1
the	1
waterside	1
about	1
a	1
quarter	1
of	1
a	1
mile,	1
till	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
man's	1
house.	1
He	1
was	1
just	1
come	1
home	1
from	1
work,	1
and	1
was	1
surprised	1
when	1
Jem	1
showed	1
him	1
the	1
half-crown,	1
saying,	1
"Look	1
what	1
I	1
got	1
for	1
the	1
stones;	1
you	1
are	1
to	1
have	1
half,	1
you	1
know."	1
"No,"	1
said	1
the	1
man,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
his	1
story,	1
"I	1
shall	1
not	1
take	1
half	1
of	1
that;	1
it	1
was	1
given	1
to	1
you.	1
I	1
expected	1
but	1
a	1
shilling	1
at	1
the	1
most,	1
and	1
the	1
half	1
of	1
that	1
is	1
but	1
sixpence,	1
and	1
that	1
I'll	1
take.	1
Wife,	1
give	1
the	1
lad	1
two	1
shillings,	1
and	1
take	1
this	1
half-crown."	1
So	1
the	1
wife	1
opened	1
an	1
old	1
glove,	1
and	1
took	1
out	1
two	1
shillings;	1
and	1
the	1
man,	1
as	1
she	1
opened	1
the	1
glove,	1
put	1
in	1
his	1
fingers,	1
and	1
took	1
out	1
a	1
little	1
silver	1
penny.	1
"There,	1
he	1
shall	1
have	1
that	1
into	1
the	1
bargain	1
for	1
his	1
honesty--honesty	1
is	1
the	1
best	1
policy--	1
there's	1
a	1
lucky	1
penny	1
for	1
you,	1
that	1
I've	1
kept	1
ever	1
since	1
I	1
can	1
remember."	1
"Don't	1
you	1
ever	1
go	1
to	1
part	1
with	1
it,	1
do	1
ye	1
hear!"	1
cried	1
the	1
woman.	1
"Let	1
him	1
do	1
what	1
he	1
will	1
with	1
it,	1
wife,"	1
said	1
the	1
man.	1
"But,"	1
argued	1
the	1
wife,	1
"another	1
penny	1
would	1
do	1
just	1
as	1
well	1
to	1
buy	1
gingerbread;	1
and	1
that's	1
what	1
it	1
will	1
go	1
for."	1
"No,	1
that	1
it	1
shall	1
not,	1
I	1
promise	1
you,"	1
said	1
Jem;	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
ran	1
away	1
home,	1
fed	1
Lightfoot,	1
stroked	1
him,	1
went	1
to	1
bed,	1
jumped	1
up	1
at	1
five	1
o'clock	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
went	1
singing	1
to	1
work	1
as	1
gay	1
as	1
a	1
lark.	1
Four	1
days	1
he	1
worked	1
"every	1
day	1
and	1
all	1
day	1
long";	1
and	1
every	1
evening	1
the	1
lady,	1
when	1
she	1
came	1
out	1
to	1
walk	1
in	1
her	1
gardens,	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
work.	1
At	1
last	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
gardener,	1
"This	1
little	1
boy	1
works	1
very	1
hard."	1
"Never	1
had	1
so	1
good	1
a	1
little	1
boy	1
about	1
the	1
grounds,"	1
said	1
the	1
gardener;	1
"he's	1
always	1
at	1
his	1
work,	1
let	1
me	1
come	1
by	1
when	1
I	1
will,	1
and	1
he	1
has	1
got	1
twice	1
as	1
much	1
done	1
as	1
another	1
would	1
do;	1
yes,	1
twice	1
as	1
much,	1
ma'am;	1
for	1
look	1
here--he	1
began	1
at	1
this	1
'ere	1
rose-bush,	1
and	1
now	1
he's	1
got	1
to	1
where	1
you	1
stand,	1
ma'am;	1
and	1
here	1
is	1
the	1
day's	1
work	1
that	1
t'other	1
boy,	1
and	1
he's	1
three	1
years	1
older	1
too,	1
did	1
to-day--I	1
say,	1
measure	1
Jem's	1
fairly,	1
and	1
it's	1
twice	1
as	1
much,	1
I'm	1
sure."	1
"Well,"	1
said	1
the	1
lady	1
to	1
her	1
gardener,	1
"show	1
me	1
how	1
much	1
is	1
a	1
fair	1
day's	1
work	1
for	1
a	1
boy	1
of	1
his	1
age."	1
"Come	1
at	1
six	1
o'clock	1
and	1
go	1
at	1
six?	1
why,	1
about	1
this	1
much,	1
ma'am,"	1
said	1
the	1
gardener,	1
marking	1
off	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
the	1
border	1
with	1
his	1
spade.	1
"Then,	1
little	1
boy,"	1
said	1
the	1
lady,	1
"so	1
much	1
shall	1
be	1
your	1
task	1
every	1
day.	1
The	1
gardener	1
will	1
mark	1
it	1
off	1
for	1
you;	1
and	1
when	1
you've	1
done,	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
you	1
may	1
do	1
what	1
you	1
please."	1
Jem	1
was	1
extremely	1
glad	1
of	1
this;	1
and	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
he	1
had	1
finished	1
his	1
task	1
by	1
four	1
o'clock;	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
evening	1
to	1
himself.	1
He	1
was	1
as	1
fond	1
of	1
play	1
as	1
any	1
little	1
boy	1
could	1
be;	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
it	1
he	1
played	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
eagerness	1
and	1
gaiety	1
imaginable;	1
so	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
finished	1
his	1
task,	1
fed	1
Lightfoot,	1
and	1
put	1
by	1
the	1
sixpence	1
he	1
had	1
earned	1
that	1
day,	1
he	1
ran	1
to	1
the	1
playground	1
in	1
the	1
village,	1
where	1
he	1
found	1
a	1
party	1
of	1
boys	1
playing,	1
and	1
amongst	1
them	1
Lazy	1
Lawrence,	1
who	1
indeed	1
was	1
not	1
playing,	1
but	1
lounging	1
upon	1
a	1
gate,	1
with	1
his	1
thumb	1
in	1
his	1
mouth.	1
The	1
rest	1
were	1
playing	1
at	1
cricket.	1
Jem	1
joined	1
them,	1
and	1
was	1
the	1
merriest	1
and	1
most	1
active	1
amongst	1
them;	1
till,	1
at	1
last,	1
when	1
quite	1
out	1
of	1
breath	1
with	1
running,	1
he	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
give	1
up	1
to	1
rest	1
himself,	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
upon	1
the	1
stile,	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
gate	1
on	1
which	1
Lazy	1
Lawrence	1
was	1
swinging.	1
"And	1
why	1
don't	1
you	1
play,	1
Lawrence?"	1
said	1
he.	1
"I'm	1
tired,"	1
said	1
Lawrence.	1
"Tired	1
of	1
what?"	1
"I	1
don't	1
know	1
well	1
what	1
tires	1
me;	1
grandmother	1
says	1
I'm	1
ill,	1
and	1
I	1
must	1
take	1
something--I	1
don't	1
know	1
what	1
ails	1
me."	1
"Oh,	1
pugh!	1
take	1
a	1
good	1
race--one,	1
two,	1
three,	1
and	1
away--and	1
you'll	1
find	1
yourself	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
ever.	1
Come,	1
run--one,	1
two,	1
three,	1
and	1
away."	1
"Ah,	1
no,	1
I	1
can't	1
run,	1
indeed,"	1
said	1
he,	1
hanging	1
back	1
heavily;	1
"you	1
know	1
I	1
can	1
play	1
all	1
day	1
long	1
if	1
I	1
like	1
it,	1
so	1
I	1
don't	1
mind	1
play	1
as	1
you	1
do,	1
who	1
have	1
only	1
one	1
hour	1
for	1
it."	1
"So	1
much	1
the	1
worse	1
for	1
you.	1
Come,	1
now,	1
I'm	1
quite	1
fresh	1
again,	1
will	1
you	1
have	1
one	1
game	1
at	1
ball?	1
do."	1
"No,	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
I	1
can't;	1
I'm	1
as	1
tired	1
as	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
been	1
working	1
all	1
day	1
long	1
as	1
hard	1
as	1
a	1
horse."	1
"Ten	1
times	1
more,"	1
said	1
Jem,	1
"for	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
working	1
all	1
day	1
long,	1
as	1
hard	1
as	1
a	1
horse,	1
and	1
yet	1
you	1
see	1
I'm	1
not	1
a	1
bit	1
tired,	1
only	1
a	1
little	1
out	1
of	1
breath	1
just	1
now."	1
"That's	1
very	1
odd,"	1
said	1
Lawrence,	1
and	1
yawned,	1
for	1
want	1
of	1
some	1
better	1
answer;	1
then	1
taking	1
out	1
a	1
handful	1
of	1
halfpence,--"See	1
what	1
I	1
got	1
from	1
father	1
today,	1
because	1
I	1
asked	1
him	1
just	1
at	1
the	1
right	1
time,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
drunk	1
a	1
glass	1
or	1
two;	1
then	1
I	1
can	1
get	1
anything	1
I	1
want	1
out	1
of	1
him--see!	1
a	1
penny,	1
twopence,	1
threepence,	1
fourpence--there's	1
eightpence	1
in	1
all;	1
would	1
not	1
you	1
be	1
happy	1
if	1
you	1
had	1
EIGHTPENCE?"	1
"Why,	1
I	1
don't	1
know,"	1
said	1
Jem,	1
laughing,	1
"for	1
you	1
don't	1
seem	1
happy,	1
and	1
you	1
HAVE	1
EIGHTPENCE."	1
"That	1
does	1
not	1
signify,	1
though.	1
I'm	1
sure	1
you	1
only	1
say	1
that	1
because	1
you	1
envy	1
me.	1
You	1
don't	1
know	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
have	1
eightpence.	1
You	1
never	1
had	1
more	1
than	1
twopence	1
or	1
threepence	1
at	1
a	1
time	1
in	1
all	1
your	1
life."	1
Jem	1
smiled.	1
"Oh,	1
as	1
to	1
that,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"you	1
are	1
mistaken,	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
at	1
this	1
very	1
time	1
more	1
than	1
twopence,	1
threepence,	1
or	1
eightpence	1
either.	1
I	1
have--let	1
me--see--stones,	1
two	1
shillings;	1
then	1
five	1
days'	1
work--that's	1
five	1
sixpences,	1
that's	1
two	1
shillings	1
and	1
sixpence;	1
in	1
all,	1
makes	1
four	1
shillings	1
and	1
sixpence;	1
and	1
my	1
silver	1
penny,	1
is	1
four	1
and	1
sevenpence--four	1
and	1
sevenpence!"	1
"You	1
have	1
not!"	1
said	1
Lawrence,	1
roused	1
so	1
as	1
absolutely	1
to	1
stand	1
upright,	1
"four	1
and	1
sevenpence,	1
have	1
you?	1
Show	1
it	1
me,	1
and	1
then	1
I'll	1
believe	1
you."	1
"Follow	1
me,	1
then,"	1
cried	1
Jem,	1
"and	1
I'll	1
soon	1
make	1
you	1
believe	1
me;	1
come."	1
"Is	1
it	1
far?"	1
said	1
Lawrence,	1
following	1
half-running,	1
half-hobbling,	1
till	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
stable,	1
where	1
Jem	1
showed	1
him	1
his	1
treasure.	1
"And	1
how	1
did	1
you	1
come	1
by	1
it--honestly?"	1
"Honestly!	1
to	1
be	1
sure	1
I	1
did;	1
I	1
earned	1
it	1
all."	1
"Lord	1
bless	1
me,	1
earned	1
it!	1
well,	1
I've	1
a	1
great	1
mind	1
to	1
work;	1
but	1
then	1
it's	1
such	1
hot	1
weather,	1
besides,	1
grandmother	1
says	1
I'm	1
not	1
strong	1
enough	1
yet	1
for	1
hard	1
work;	1
and	1
besides,	1
I	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
coax	1
daddy	1
out	1
of	1
money	1
when	1
I	1
want	1
it,	1
so	1
I	1
need	1
not	1
work.	1
But	1
four	1
and	1
sevenpence;	1
let's	1
see,	1
what	1
will	1
you	1
do	1
with	1
it	1
all?"	1
"That's	1
a	1
secret,"	1
said	1
Jem,	1
looking	1
great.	1
"I	1
can	1
guess;	1
I	1
know	1
what	1
I'd	1
do	1
with	1
it	1
if	1
it	1
was	1
mine.	1
First,	1
I'd	1
buy	1
pocketfuls	1
of	1
gingerbread;	1
then	1
I'd	1
buy	1
ever	1
so	1
many	1
apples	1
and	1
nuts.	1
Don't	1
you	1
love	1
nuts?	1
I'd	1
buy	1
nuts	1
enough	1
to	1
last	1
me	1
from	1
this	1
time	1
to	1
Christmas,	1
and	1
I'd	1
make	1
little	1
Newton	1
crack	1
'em	1
for	1
me,	1
for	1
that's	1
the	1
worst	1
of	1
nuts;	1
there's	1
the	1
trouble	1
of	1
cracking	1
'em."	1
"Well,	1
you	1
never	1
deserve	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
nut."	1
"But	1
you'll	1
give	1
me	1
some	1
of	1
yours,"	1
said	1
Lawrence,	1
in	1
a	1
fawning	1
tone;	1
for	1
he	1
thought	1
it	1
easier	1
to	1
coax	1
than	1
to	1
work--"you'll	1
give	1
me	1
some	1
of	1
your	1
good	1
things,	1
won't	1
you?"	1
"I	1
shall	1
not	1
have	1
any	1
of	1
those	1
good	1
things,"	1
said	1
Jem.	1
"Then,	1
what	1
will	1
you	1
do	1
with	1
all	1
your	1
money?"	1
"Oh,	1
I	1
know	1
very	1
well	1
what	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
it;	1
but,	1
as	1
I	1
told	1
you,	1
that's	1
a	1
secret,	1
and	1
I	1
sha'n't	1
tell	1
it	1
anybody.	1
Come	1
now,	1
let's	1
go	1
back	1
and	1
play-	1
-their	1
game's	1
up,	1
I	1
daresay."	1
Lawrence	1
went	1
back	1
with	1
him,	1
full	1
of	1
curiosity,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
humour	1
with	1
himself	1
and	1
his	1
eightpence.	1
"If	1
I	1
had	1
four	1
and	1
sevenpence,"	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
himself,	1
"I	1
certainly	1
should	1
be	1
happy!"	1
The	1
next	1
day,	1
as	1
usual,	1
Jem	1
jumped	1
up	1
before	1
six	1
o'clock	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
his	1
work,	1
whilst	1
Lazy	1
Lawrence	1
sauntered	1
about	1
without	1
knowing	1
what	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
himself.	1
In	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
two	1
days	1
he	1
laid	1
out	1
sixpence	1
of	1
his	1
money	1
in	1
apples	1
and	1
gingerbread;	1
and	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
these	1
lasted,	1
he	1
found	1
himself	1
well	1
received	1
by	1
his	1
companions;	1
but,	1
at	1
length	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
he	1
spent	1
his	1
last	1
halfpenny,	1
and	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
gone,	1
unfortunately	1
some	1
nuts	1
tempted	1
him	1
very	1
much,	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
money	1
to	1
pay	1
for	1
them;	1
so	1
he	1
ran	1
home	1
to	1
coax	1
his	1
father,	1
as	1
he	1
called	1
it.	1
When	1
he	1
got	1
home	1
he	1
heard	1
his	1
father	1
talking	1
very	1
loud,	1
and	1
at	1
first	1
he	1
thought	1
he	1
was	1
drunk;	1
but	1
when	1
he	1
opened	1
the	1
kitchen	1
door,	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
drunk,	1
but	1
angry.	1
"You	1
lazy	1
dog!"	1
cried	1
he,	1
turning	1
suddenly	1
upon	1
Lawrence,	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
such	1
a	1
violent	1
box	1
on	1
the	1
ear	1
as	1
made	1
the	1
light	1
flash	1
from	1
his	1
eyes;	1
"you	1
lazy	1
dog!	1
See	1
what	1
you've	1
done	1
for	1
me--look!--look,	1
look,	1
I	1
say!"	1
Lawrence	1
looked	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
his	1
senses,	1
and	1
with	1
fear,	1
amazement	1
and	1
remorse,	1
beheld	1
at	1
least	1
a	1
dozen	1
bottles	1
burst,	1
and	1
the	1
fine	1
Worcestershire	1
cider	1
streaming	1
over	1
the	1
floor.	1
"Now,	1
did	1
not	1
I	1
order	1
you	1
three	1
days	1
ago	1
to	1
carry	1
these	1
bottles	1
to	1
the	1
cellar,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
I	1
charge	1
you	1
to	1
wire	1
the	1
corks?	1
answer	1
me,	1
you	1
lazy	1
rascal;	1
did	1
not	1
I?"	1
"Yes,"	1
said	1
Lawrence,	1
scratching	1
his	1
head.	1
"And	1
why	1
was	1
not	1
it	1
done,	1
I	1
ask	1
you?"	1
cried	1
his	1
father,	1
with	1
renewed	1
anger,	1
as	1
another	1
bottle	1
burst	1
at	1
the	1
moment.	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
stand	1
there	1
for,	1
you	1
lazy	1
brat?	1
why	1
don't	1
you	1
move,	1
I	1
say?	1
No,	1
no,"	1
catching	1
hold	1
of	1
him,	1
"I	1
believe	1
you	1
can't	1
move;	1
but	1
I'll	1
make	1
you."	1
And	1
he	1
shook	1
him	1
till	1
Lawrence	1
was	1
so	1
giddy	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
stand.	1
"What	1
had	1
you	1
to	1
think	1
of?	1
What	1
had	1
you	1
to	1
do	1
all	1
day	1
long	1
that	1
you	1
could	1
not	1
carry	1
my	1
cider,	1
my	1
Worcestershire	1
cider,	1
to	1
the	1
cellar	1
when	1
I	1
bid	1
you?	1
But	1
go,	1
you'll	1
never	1
be	1
good	1
for	1
anything;	1
you	1
are	1
such	1
a	1
lazy	1
rascal--get	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
sight!"	1
So	1
saying,	1
he	1
pushed	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
door,	1
and	1
Lawrence	1
sneaked	1
off,	1
seeing	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
no	1
time	1
to	1
make	1
his	1
petition	1
for	1
halfpence.	1
The	1
next	1
day	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
nuts	1
again,	1
and	1
wishing	1
for	1
them	1
more	1
than	1
ever,	1
he	1
went	1
home,	1
in	1
hopes	1
that	1
his	1
father,	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself,	1
would	1
be	1
in	1
a	1
better	1
humour.	1
But	1
the	1
cider	1
was	1
still	1
fresh	1
in	1
his	1
recollection;	1
and	1
the	1
moment	1
Lawrence	1
began	1
to	1
whisper	1
the	1
word	1
"halfpenny"	1
in	1
his	1
ear,	1
his	1
father	1
swore,	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
oath,	1
"I	1
will	1
not	1
give	1
you	1
a	1
halfpenny,	1
no,	1
not	1
a	1
farthing,	1
for	1
a	1
month	1
to	1
come.	1
If	1
you	1
want	1
money,	1
go	1
work	1
for	1
it;	1
I've	1
had	1
enough	1
of	1
your	1
laziness--go	1
work!"	1
At	1
these	1
terrible	1
words	1
Lawrence	1
burst	1
into	1
tears,	1
and,	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
a	1
ditch,	1
sat	1
down	1
and	1
cried	1
for	1
an	1
hour;	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
cried	1
till	1
he	1
could	1
cry	1
no	1
more,	1
he	1
exerted	1
himself	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
to	1
empty	1
his	1
pockets,	1
to	1
see	1
whether	1
there	1
might	1
not	1
happen	1
to	1
be	1
one	1
halfpenny	1
left;	1
and,	1
to	1
his	1
great	1
joy,	1
in	1
the	1
farthest	1
corner	1
of	1
his	1
pocket	1
one	1
halfpenny	1
was	1
found.	1
With	1
this	1
he	1
proceeded	1
to	1
the	1
fruit	1
woman's	1
stall.	1
She	1
was	1
busy	1
weighing	1
out	1
some	1
plums,	1
so	1
he	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
wait;	1
and	1
whilst	1
he	1
was	1
waiting	1
he	1
heard	1
some	1
people	1
near	1
him	1
talking	1
and	1
laughing	1
very	1
loud.	1
The	1
fruit	1
woman's	1
stall	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
an	1
inn	1
yard;	1
and	1
peeping	1
through	1
the	1
gate	1
in	1
this	1
yard,	1
Lawrence	1
saw	1
a	1
postilion	1
and	1
a	1
stable	1
boy,	1
about	1
his	1
own	1
size,	1
playing	1
at	1
pitch	1
farthing.	1
He	1
stood	1
by	1
watching	1
them	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
minutes.	1
"I	1
began	1
but	1
with	1
one	1
halfpenny,"	1
cried	1
the	1
stable	1
boy,	1
with	1
an	1
oath,	1
"and	1
now	1
I've	1
got	1
twopence!"	1
added	1
he,	1
jingling	1
the	1
halfpence	1
in	1
his	1
waistcoat	1
pocket.	1
Lawrence	1
was	1
moved	1
at	1
the	1
sound,	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
himself,	1
"If	1
_I_	1
begin	1
with	1
one	1
halfpenny	1
I	1
may	1
end,	1
like	1
him,	1
with	1
having	1
twopence;	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
easier	1
to	1
play	1
at	1
pitch	1
farthing	1
than	1
to	1
work."	1
So	1
he	1
stepped	1
forward,	1
presenting	1
his	1
halfpenny,	1
offering	1
to	1
toss	1
up	1
with	1
the	1
stable	1
boy,	1
who,	1
after	1
looking	1
him	1
full	1
in	1
the	1
face,	1
accepted	1
the	1
proposal,	1
and	1
threw	1
his	1
halfpenny	1
into	1
the	1
air.	1
"Head	1
or	1
tail?"	1
cried	1
he.	1
"Head,"	1
replied	1
Lawrence,	1
and	1
it	1
came	1
up	1
head.	1
He	1
seized	1
the	1
penny,	1
surprised	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
success,	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
gone	1
instantly	1
to	1
have	1
laid	1
it	1
out	1
in	1
nuts;	1
but	1
the	1
stable	1
boy	1
stopped	1
him,	1
and	1
tempted	1
him	1
to	1
throw	1
again.	1
This	1
time	1
Lawrence	1
lost;	1
he	1
threw	1
again	1
and	1
won;	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
went	1
on,	1
sometimes	1
losing,	1
but	1
most	1
frequently	1
winning,	1
till	1
half	1
the	1
morning	1
was	1
lost.	1
At	1
last,	1
however,	1
finding	1
himself	1
the	1
master	1
of	1
three	1
halfpence,	1
said	1
he	1
would	1
play	1
no	1
more.	1
The	1
stable	1
boy,	1
grumbling,	1
swore	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
his	1
revenge	1
another	1
time,	1
and	1
Lawrence	1
went	1
and	1
bought	1
his	1
nuts.	1
"It	1
is	1
a	1
good	1
thing,"	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
himself,	1
"to	1
play	1
at	1
pitch	1
farthing;	1
the	1
next	1
time	1
I	1
want	1
a	1
halfpenny	1
I'll	1
not	1
ask	1
my	1
father	1
for	1
it,	1
nor	1
go	1
to	1
work	1
neither."	1
Satisfied	1
with	1
this	1
resolution,	1
he	1
sat	1
down	1
to	1
crack	1
his	1
nuts	1
at	1
his	1
leisure,	1
upon	1
the	1
horse	1
block	1
in	1
the	1
inn	1
yard.	1
Here,	1
whilst	1
he	1
ate,	1
he	1
overheard	1
the	1
conversation	1
of	1
the	1
stable	1
boys	1
and	1
postilions.	1
At	1
first	1
their	1
shocking	1
oaths	1
and	1
loud	1
wrangling	1
frightened	1
and	1
shocked	1
him;	1
for	1
Lawrence,	1
though	1
lazy,	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
learned	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
wicked	1
boy.	1
But,	1
by	1
degrees,	1
he	1
was	1
accustomed	1
to	1
the	1
swearing	1
and	1
quarrelling,	1
and	1
took	1
a	1
delight	1
and	1
interest	1
in	1
their	1
disputes	1
and	1
battles.	1
As	1
this	1
was	1
an	1
amusement	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
enjoy	1
without	1
any	1
sort	1
of	1
exertion,	1
he	1
soon	1
grew	1
so	1
fond	1
of	1
it,	1
that	1
every	1
day	1
he	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
stable	1
yard,	1
and	1
the	1
horse	1
block	1
became	1
his	1
constant	1
seat.	1
Here	1
he	1
found	1
some	1
relief	1
from	1
the	1
insupportable	1
fatigue	1
of	1
doing	1
nothing,	1
and	1
here,	1
hour	1
after	1
hour,	1
with	1
his	1
elbows	1
on	1
his	1
knees,	1
and	1
his	1
head	1
on	1
his	1
hands,	1
he	1
sat,	1
the	1
spectator	1
of	1
wickedness.	1
Gaming,	1
cheating	1
and	1
lying	1
soon	1
became	1
familiar	1
to	1
him;	1
and,	1
to	1
complete	1
his	1
ruin,	1
he	1
formed	1
a	1
sudden	1
and	1
close	1
intimacy	1
with	1
the	1
stable	1
boy	1
(a	1
very	1
bad	1
boy)	1
with	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
first	1
begun	1
to	1
game.	1
The	1
consequences	1
of	1
this	1
intimacy	1
we	1
shall	1
presently	1
see.	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
now	1
time	1
to	1
inquire	1
what	1
little	1
Jem	1
had	1
been	1
doing	1
all	1
this	1
while.	1
One	1
day,	1
after	1
Jem	1
had	1
finished	1
his	1
task,	1
the	1
gardener	1
asked	1
him	1
to	1
stay	1
a	1
little	1
while,	1
to	1
help	1
him	1
to	1
carry	1
some	1
geranium	1
pots	1
into	1
the	1
hall.	1
Jem,	1
always	1
active	1
and	1
obliging,	1
readily	1
stayed	1
from	1
play,	1
and	1
was	1
carrying	1
in	1
a	1
heavy	1
flower	1
pot,	1
when	1
his	1
mistress	1
crossed	1
the	1
hall.	1
"What	1
a	1
terrible	1
litter!"	1
said	1
she,	1
"you	1
are	1
making	1
here--why	1
don't	1
you	1
wipe	1
your	1
shoes	1
upon	1
the	1
mat?"	1
Jem	1
turned	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
the	1
mat,	1
but	1
he	1
saw	1
none.	1
"Oh,"	1
said	1
the	1
lady	1
recollecting	1
herself,	1
"I	1
can't	1
blame	1
you,	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
mat."	1
"No,	1
ma'am,"	1
said	1
the	1
gardener,	1
"nor	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
when,	1
if	1
ever,	1
the	1
man	1
will	1
bring	1
home	1
those	1
mats	1
you	1
bespoke,	1
ma'am."	1
"I	1
am	1
very	1
sorry	1
to	1
hear	1
that,"	1
said	1
the	1
lady;	1
"I	1
wish	1
we	1
could	1
find	1
somebody	1
who	1
would	1
do	1
them,	1
if	1
he	1
can't.	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
care	1
what	1
sort	1
of	1
mats	1
they	1
were,	1
so	1
that	1
one	1
could	1
wipe	1
one's	1
feet	1
on	1
them."	1
Jem,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
sweeping	1
away	1
the	1
litter,	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
these	1
last	1
words,	1
said	1
to	1
himself,	1
"Perhaps	1
I	1
could	1
make	1
a	1
mat."	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
way	1
home,	1
as	1
he	1
trudged	1
along	1
whistling,	1
he	1
was	1
thinking	1
over	1
a	1
scheme	1
for	1
making	1
mats,	1
which,	1
however	1
bold	1
it	1
may	1
appear,	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
despair	1
of	1
executing,	1
with	1
patience	1
and	1
industry.	1
Many	1
were	1
the	1
difficulties	1
which	1
his	1
"prophetic	1
eye"	1
foresaw;	1
but	1
he	1
felt	1
within	1
himself	1
that	1
spirit	1
which	1
spurs	1
men	1
on	1
to	1
great	1
enterprises,	1
and	1
makes	1
them	1
"trample	1
on	1
impossibilities."	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
place,	1
he	1
recollected	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
Lazy	1
Lawrence,	1
whilst	1
he	1
lounged	1
upon	1
the	1
gate,	1
twist	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
heath	1
into	1
different	1
shapes;	1
and	1
he	1
thought,	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
could	1
find	1
some	1
way	1
of	1
plaiting	1
heath	1
firmly	1
together,	1
it	1
would	1
make	1
a	1
very	1
pretty	1
green	1
soft	1
mat,	1
which	1
would	1
do	1
very	1
well	1
for	1
one	1
to	1
wipe	1
one's	1
shoes	1
on.	1
About	1
a	1
mile	1
from	1
his	1
mother's	1
house,	1
on	1
the	1
common	1
which	1
Jem	1
rode	1
over	1
when	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
Farmer	1
Truck's	1
for	1
the	1
giant	1
strawberries,	1
he	1
remembered	1
to	1
have	1
seen	1
a	1
great	1
quantity	1
of	1
this	1
heath;	1
and,	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
now	1
only	1
six	1
o'clock	1
in	1
the	1
evening,	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
have	1
time	1
to	1
feed	1
Lightfoot,	1
stroke	1
him,	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
common,	1
return,	1
and	1
make	1
one	1
trial	1
of	1
his	1
skill	1
before	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
bed.	1
Lightfoot	1
carried	1
him	1
swiftly	1
to	1
the	1
common,	1
and	1
there	1
Jem	1
gathered	1
as	1
much	1
of	1
the	1
heath	1
as	1
he	1
thought	1
he	1
should	1
want.	1
But	1
what	1
toil!	1
what	1
time!	1
what	1
pains	1
did	1
it	1
cost	1
him,	1
before	1
he	1
could	1
make	1
anything	1
like	1
a	1
mat!	1
Twenty	1
times	1
he	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
throw	1
aside	1
the	1
heath,	1
and	1
give	1
up	1
his	1
project,	1
from	1
impatience	1
of	1
repeated	1
disappointments.	1
But	1
still	1
he	1
persevered.	1
Nothing	1
TRULY	1
GREAT	1
can	1
be	1
accomplished	1
without	1
toil	1
and	1
time.	1
Two	1
hours	1
he	1
worked	1
before	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
bed.	1
All	1
his	1
play	1
hours	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
he	1
spent	1
at	1
his	1
mat;	1
which,	1
in	1
all,	1
made	1
five	1
hours	1
of	1
fruitless	1
attempts.	1
The	1
sixth,	1
however,	1
repaid	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
labours	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
five.	1
He	1
conquered	1
his	1
grand	1
difficulty	1
of	1
fastening	1
the	1
heath	1
substantially	1
together,	1
and	1
at	1
length	1
completely	1
finished	1
a	1
mat,	1
which	1
far	1
surpassed	1
his	1
most	1
sanguine	1
expectations.	1
He	1
was	1
extremely	1
happy--	1
sang,	1
danced	1
round	1
it--whistled--looked	1
at	1
it	1
again	1
and	1
again,	1
and	1
could	1
hardly	1
leave	1
off	1
looking	1
at	1
it	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
time	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
bed.	1
He	1
laid	1
it	1
by	1
his	1
bedside,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
see	1
it	1
the	1
moment	1
he	1
awoke	1
in	1
the	1
morning.	1
And	1
now	1
came	1
the	1
grand	1
pleasure	1
of	1
carrying	1
it	1
to	1
his	1
mistress.	1
She	1
looked	1
fully	1
as	1
much	1
surprised	1
as	1
he	1
expected,	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
it,	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
heard	1
who	1
made	1
it.	1
After	1
having	1
duly	1
admired	1
it,	1
she	1
asked	1
how	1
much	1
he	1
expected	1
for	1
his	1
mat.	1
"Expect!--Nothing,	1
ma'am,"	1
said	1
Jem;	1
"I	1
meant	1
to	1
give	1
it	1
you,	1
if	1
you'd	1
have	1
it;	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
mean	1
to	1
sell	1
it.	1
I	1
made	1
it	1
in	1
my	1
play	1
hours,	1
I	1
was	1
very	1
happy	1
in	1
making	1
it;	1
and	1
I'm	1
very	1
glad,	1
too,	1
that	1
you	1
like	1
it;	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
please	1
to	1
keep	1
it,	1
ma'am,	1
that's	1
all."	1
"But	1
that's	1
not	1
all,"	1
said	1
the	1
lady.	1
"Spend	1
your	1
time	1
no	1
more	1
in	1
weeding	1
in	1
my	1
garden,	1
you	1
can	1
employ	1
yourself	1
much	1
better;	1
you	1
shall	1
have	1
the	1
reward	1
of	1
your	1
ingenuity	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
of	1
your	1
industry.	1
Make	1
as	1
many	1
more	1
such	1
mats	1
as	1
you	1
can,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
care	1
and	1
dispose	1
of	1
them	1
for	1
you."	1
"Thank'e,	1
ma'am,"	1
said	1
Jem,	1
making	1
his	1
best	1
bow,	1
for	1
he	1
thought	1
by	1
the	1
lady's	1
looks	1
that	1
she	1
meant	1
to	1
do	1
him	1
a	1
favour,	1
though	1
he	1
repeated	1
to	1
himself,	1
"Dispose	1
of	1
them,	1
what	1
does	1
that	1
mean?"	1
The	1
next	1
day	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
work	1
to	1
make	1
more	1
mats,	1
and	1
he	1
soon	1
learned	1
to	1
make	1
them	1
so	1
well	1
and	1
quickly,	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
surprised	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
success.	1
In	1
every	1
one	1
he	1
made	1
he	1
found	1
less	1
difficulty,	1
so	1
that,	1
instead	1
of	1
making	1
two,	1
he	1
could	1
soon	1
make	1
four	1
in	1
a	1
day.	1
In	1
a	1
fortnight	1
he	1
made	1
eighteen.	1
It	1
was	1
Saturday	1
night	1
when	1
he	1
finished,	1
and	1
he	1
carried,	1
at	1
three	1
journeys,	1
his	1
eighteen	1
mats	1
to	1
his	1
mistress'	1
house;	1
piled	1
them	1
all	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
hall,	1
and	1
stood	1
with	1
his	1
hat	1
off,	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
proud	1
humility,	1
beside	1
the	1
pile,	1
waiting	1
for	1
his	1
mistress'	1
appearance.	1
Presently	1
a	1
folding-door,	1
at	1
one	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
hall,	1
opened,	1
and	1
he	1
saw	1
his	1
mistress,	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
many	1
gentlemen	1
and	1
ladies,	1
rising	1
from	1
several	1
tables.	1
"Oh!	1
there	1
is	1
my	1
little	1
boy	1
and	1
his	1
mats,"	1
cried	1
the	1
lady;	1
and,	1
followed	1
by	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
company,	1
she	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
hall.	1
Jem	1
modestly	1
retired	1
whilst	1
they	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
mats;	1
but	1
in	1
a	1
minute	1
or	1
two	1
his	1
mistress	1
beckoned	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
circle,	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
his	1
pile	1
of	1
mats	1
had	1
disappeared.	1
"Well,"	1
said	1
the	1
lady,	1
smiling,	1
"what	1
do	1
you	1
see	1
that	1
makes	1
you	1
look	1
so	1
surprised?"	1
"That	1
all	1
my	1
mats	1
are	1
gone,"	1
said	1
Jem;	1
"but	1
you	1
are	1
very	1
welcome."	1
"Are	1
we?"	1
said	1
the	1
lady,	1
"well,	1
take	1
up	1
your	1
hat	1
and	1
go	1
home	1
then,	1
for	1
you	1
see	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
getting	1
late,	1
and	1
you	1
know	1
Lightfoot	1
will	1
wonder	1
what's	1
become	1
of	1
you."	1
Jem	1
turned	1
round	1
to	1
take	1
up	1
his	1
hat,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
on	1
the	1
floor.	1
But	1
how	1
his	1
countenance	1
changed!	1
the	1
hat	1
was	1
heavy	1
with	1
shillings.	1
Everyone	1
who	1
had	1
taken	1
a	1
mat	1
had	1
put	1
in	1
two	1
shillings;	1
so	1
that	1
for	1
the	1
eighteen	1
mats	1
he	1
had	1
got	1
thirty-six	1
shillings.	1
"Thirty-six	1
shillings,"	1
said	1
the	1
lady;	1
"five	1
and	1
sevenpence	1
I	1
think	1
you	1
told	1
me	1
you	1
had	1
earned	1
already--how	1
much	1
does	1
that	1
make?	1
I	1
must	1
add,	1
I	1
believe,	1
one	1
other	1
sixpence	1
to	1
make	1
out	1
your	1
two	1
guineas."	1
"Two	1
guineas!"	1
exclaimed	1
Jem,	1
now	1
quite	1
conquering	1
his	1
bashfulness,	1
for	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
he	1
forgot	1
where	1
he	1
was,	1
and	1
saw	1
nobody	1
that	1
was	1
by.	1
"Two	1
guineas!"	1
cried	1
he,	1
clapping	1
his	1
hands	1
together,--"O,	1
Lightfoot!	1
O,	1
mother!"	1
Then,	1
recollecting	1
himself,	1
he	1
saw	1
his	1
mistress,	1
whom	1
he	1
now	1
looked	1
up	1
to	1
quite	1
as	1
a	1
friend.	1
"Will	1
YOU	1
thank	1
them	1
all?"	1
said	1
he,	1
scarcely	1
daring	1
to	1
glance	1
his	1
eyes	1
round	1
upon	1
the	1
company;	1
"will	1
YOU	1
thank	1
'em,	1
for	1
you	1
know	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
thank	1
'em	1
RIGHTLY."	1
Everybody	1
thought,	1
however,	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
thanked	1
RIGHTLY.	1
"Now	1
we	1
won't	1
keep	1
you	1
any	1
longer,	1
only,"	1
said	1
his	1
mistress,	1
"I	1
have	1
one	1
thing	1
to	1
ask	1
you,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
by	1
when	1
you	1
show	1
your	1
treasure	1
to	1
your	1
mother."	1
"Come,	1
then,"	1
said	1
Jem,	1
"come	1
with	1
me	1
now."	1
"Not	1
now,"	1
said	1
the	1
lady,	1
laughing;	1
"but	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
to	1
Ashton	1
to-morrow	1
evening;	1
perhaps	1
your	1
mother	1
can	1
find	1
me	1
a	1
few	1
strawberries."	1
"That	1
she	1
will,"	1
said	1
Jem:	1
"I'll	1
search	1
the	1
garden	1
myself."	1
He	1
now	1
went	1
home,	1
but	1
felt	1
it	1
a	1
great	1
restraint	1
to	1
wait	1
till	1
to-morrow	1
evening	1
before	1
he	1
told	1
his	1
mother.	1
To	1
console	1
himself	1
he	1
flew	1
to	1
the	1
stable:--"Lightfoot,	1
you're	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
sold	1
on	1
Monday,	1
poor	1
fellow!"	1
said	1
he,	1
patting	1
him,	1
and	1
then	1
could	1
not	1
refrain	1
from	1
counting	1
out	1
his	1
money.	1
Whilst	1
he	1
was	1
intent	1
upon	1
this,	1
Jem	1
was	1
startled	1
by	1
a	1
noise	1
at	1
the	1
door:	1
somebody	1
was	1
trying	1
to	1
pull	1
up	1
the	1
latch.	1
It	1
opened,	1
and	1
there	1
came	1
in	1
Lazy	1
Lawrence,	1
with	1
a	1
boy	1
in	1
a	1
red	1
jacket,	1
who	1
had	1
a	1
cock	1
under	1
his	1
arm.	1
They	1
started	1
when	1
they	1
got	1
into	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
stable,	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
Jem,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
at	1
first	1
hidden	1
by	1
the	1
horse.	1
"We--we--we	1
came,"	1
stammered	1
Lazy	1
Lawrence--"I	1
mean,	1
I	1
came	1
to--to--to--"	1
"To	1
ask	1
you,"	1
continued	1
the	1
stable-boy,	1
in	1
a	1
bold	1
tone,	1
"whether	1
you	1
will	1
go	1
with	1
us	1
to	1
the	1
cock-fight	1
on	1
Monday?	1
See,	1
I've	1
a	1
fine	1
cock	1
here,	1
and	1
Lawrence	1
told	1
me	1
you	1
were	1
a	1
great	1
friend	1
of	1
his;	1
so	1
I	1
came."	1
Lawrence	1
now	1
attempted	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
in	1
praise	1
of	1
the	1
pleasures	1
of	1
cock-fighting	1
and	1
in	1
recommendation	1
of	1
his	1
new	1
companion.	1
But	1
Jem	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
stable-boy	1
with	1
dislike,	1
and	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
dread.	1
Then	1
turning	1
his	1
eyes	1
upon	1
the	1
cock	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
compassion,	1
said,	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice,	1
to	1
Lawrence,	1
"Shall	1
you	1
like	1
to	1
stand	1
by	1
and	1
see	1
its	1
eyes	1
pecked	1
out?"	1
"I	1
don't	1
know,"	1
said	1
Lawrence,	1
"as	1
to	1
that;	1
but	1
they	1
say	1
a	1
cockfight's	1
a	1
fine	1
sight,	1
and	1
it's	1
no	1
more	1
cruel	1
in	1
me	1
to	1
go	1
than	1
another;	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
many	1
go,	1
and	1
I've	1
nothing	1
else	1
to	1
do,	1
so	1
I	1
shall	1
go."	1
"But	1
I	1
have	1
something	1
else	1
to	1
do,"	1
said	1
Jem,	1
laughing,	1
"so	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
go."	1
"But,"	1
continued	1
Lawrence,	1
"you	1
know	1
Monday	1
is	1
the	1
great	1
Bristol	1
fair,	1
and	1
one	1
must	1
be	1
merry	1
then,	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
in	1
the	1
year."	1
"One	1
day	1
in	1
the	1
year,	1
sure,	1
there's	1
no	1
harm	1
in	1
being	1
merry,"	1
said	1
the	1
stable	1
boy.	1
"I	1
hope	1
not,"	1
said	1
Jem;	1
"for	1
I	1
know	1
for	1
my	1
part,	1
I	1
am	1
merry	1
every	1
day	1
in	1
the	1
year."	1
"That's	1
very	1
odd,"	1
said	1
Lawrence;	1
"but	1
I	1
know	1
for	1
my	1
part,	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
miss	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
fair,	1
for	1
at	1
least	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
something	1
to	1
talk	1
of	1
for	1
half	1
a	1
year	1
after.	1
Come,	1
you'll	1
go,	1
won't	1
you?"	1
"No,"	1
said	1
Jem,	1
still	1
looking	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
to	1
talk	1
before	1
the	1
ill-looking	1
stranger.	1
"Then	1
what	1
will	1
you	1
do	1
with	1
all	1
your	1
money?"	1
"I'll	1
tell	1
you	1
about	1
that	1
another	1
time,"	1
whispered	1
Jem;	1
"and	1
don't	1
you	1
go	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
cock's	1
eyes	1
pecked	1
out;	1
it	1
won't	1
make	1
you	1
merry,	1
I'm	1
sure."	1
"If	1
I	1
had	1
anything	1
else	1
to	1
divert	1
me,"	1
said	1
Lawrence,	1
hesitating	1
and	1
yawning.	1
"Come,"	1
cried	1
the	1
stable	1
boy,	1
seizing	1
his	1
stretching	1
arm,	1
"come	1
along,"	1
cried	1
he;	1
and,	1
pulling	1
him	1
away	1
from	1
Jem,	1
upon	1
whom	1
he	1
cast	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
extreme	1
contempt;	1
"leave	1
him	1
alone,	1
he's	1
not	1
the	1
sort.	1
"What	1
a	1
fool	1
you	1
are,"	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
Lawrence,	1
the	1
moment	1
he	1
got	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
stable;	1
"you	1
might	1
have	1
known	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
go,	1
else	1
we	1
should	1
soon	1
have	1
trimmed	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
four	1
and	1
sevenpence.	1
But	1
how	1
came	1
you	1
to	1
talk	1
of	1
four	1
and	1
sevenpence.	1
I	1
saw	1
in	1
the	1
manger	1
a	1
hat	1
full	1
of	1
silver."	1
"Indeed!"	1
exclaimed	1
Lawrence.	1
"Yes,	1
indeed;	1
but	1
why	1
did	1
you	1
stammer	1
so	1
when	1
we	1
first	1
got	1
in?	1
You	1
had	1
liked	1
to	1
have	1
blown	1
us	1
all	1
up."	1
"I	1
was	1
so	1
ashamed,"	1
said	1
Lawrence,	1
hanging	1
down	1
his	1
head.	1
"Ashamed!	1
but	1
you	1
must	1
not	1
talk	1
of	1
shame	1
now	1
you	1
are	1
in	1
for	1
it,	1
and	1
I	1
sha'n't	1
let	1
you	1
off;	1
you	1
owe	1
us	1
half	1
a	1
crown,	1
recollect,	1
and	1
I	1
must	1
be	1
paid	1
to-night,	1
so	1
see	1
and	1
get	1
the	1
money	1
somehow	1
or	1
other."	1
After	1
a	1
considerable	1
pause	1
he	1
added,	1
"I	1
answer	1
for	1
it	1
he'd	1
never	1
miss	1
half	1
a	1
crown	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
silver."	1
"But	1
to	1
steal,"	1
said	1
Lawrence,	1
drawing	1
back	1
with	1
horror,	1
"I	1
never	1
thought	1
I	1
should	1
come	1
to	1
that--and	1
from	1
poor	1
Jem,	1
too--the	1
money	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
worked	1
so	1
hard	1
for,	1
too."	1
"But	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
stealing;	1
we	1
don't	1
mean	1
to	1
steal;	1
only	1
to	1
borrow	1
it;	1
and	1
if	1
we	1
win,	1
which	1
we	1
certainly	1
shall,	1
at	1
the	1
cock-fight,	1
pay	1
it	1
back	1
again,	1
and	1
he'll	1
never	1
know	1
anything	1
about	1
the	1
matter,	1
and	1
what	1
harm	1
will	1
it	1
do	1
him?	1
Besides,	1
what	1
signifies	1
talking,	1
you	1
can't	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
cock-	1
fight,	1
or	1
the	1
fair	1
either,	1
if	1
you	1
don't;	1
and	1
I	1
tell	1
ye	1
we	1
don't	1
mean	1
to	1
steal	1
it;	1
we'll	1
pay	1
it	1
by	1
Monday	1
night."	1
Lawrence	1
made	1
no	1
reply,	1
and	1
they	1
parted	1
without	1
his	1
coming	1
to	1
any	1
determination.	1
Here	1
let	1
us	1
pause	1
in	1
our	1
story.	1
We	1
are	1
almost	1
afraid	1
to	1
go	1
on.	1
The	1
rest	1
is	1
very	1
shocking.	1
Our	1
little	1
readers	1
will	1
shudder	1
as	1
they	1
read.	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
better	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
know	1
the	1
truth,	1
and	1
see	1
what	1
the	1
idle	1
boy	1
came	1
to	1
at	1
last.	1
In	1
the	1
dead	1
of	1
the	1
night,	1
Lawrence	1
heard	1
somebody	1
tap	1
at	1
his	1
window.	1
He	1
knew	1
well	1
who	1
it	1
was,	1
for	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
signal	1
agreed	1
upon	1
between	1
him	1
and	1
his	1
wicked	1
companion.	1
He	1
trembled	1
at	1
the	1
thoughts	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
do,	1
and	1
lay	1
quite	1
still,	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
under	1
the	1
bedclothes,	1
till	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
second	1
tap.	1
Then	1
he	1
got	1
up,	1
dressed	1
himself,	1
and	1
opened	1
his	1
window.	1
It	1
was	1
almost	1
even	1
with	1
the	1
ground.	1
His	1
companion	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
in	1
a	1
hollow	1
voice,	1
"Are	1
you	1
ready?"	1
He	1
made	1
no	1
answer,	1
but	1
got	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
followed.	1
When	1
he	1
got	1
to	1
the	1
stable	1
a	1
black	1
cloud	1
was	1
just	1
passing	1
over	1
the	1
moon,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
quite	1
dark.	1
"Where	1
are	1
you?"	1
whispered	1
Lawrence,	1
groping	1
about,	1
"where	1
are	1
you?	1
Speak	1
to	1
me."	1
"I	1
am	1
here;	1
give	1
me	1
your	1
hand."	1
Lawrence	1
stretched	1
out	1
his	1
hand.	1
"Is	1
that	1
your	1
hand?"	1
said	1
the	1
wicked	1
boy,	1
as	1
Lawrence	1
laid	1
hold	1
of	1
him;	1
"how	1
cold	1
it	1
feels."	1
"Let	1
us	1
go	1
back,"	1
said	1
Lawrence;	1
"it	1
is	1
time	1
yet."	1
"It	1
is	1
no	1
time	1
to	1
go	1
back,"	1
replied	1
the	1
other,	1
opening	1
the	1
door;	1
"you've	1
gone	1
too	1
far	1
now	1
to	1
go	1
back,"	1
and	1
he	1
pushed	1
Lawrence	1
into	1
the	1
stable.	1
"Have	1
you	1
found	1
it?	1
Take	1
care	1
of	1
the	1
horse.	1
Have	1
you	1
done?	1
What	1
are	1
you	1
about?	1
Make	1
haste,	1
I	1
hear	1
a	1
noise,"	1
said	1
the	1
stable	1
boy,	1
who	1
watched	1
at	1
the	1
door.	1
"I	1
am	1
feeling	1
for	1
the	1
half-crown,	1
but	1
I	1
can't	1
find	1
it."	1
"Bring	1
all	1
together."	1
He	1
brought	1
Jem's	1
broken	1
flower	1
pot,	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
money	1
in	1
it,	1
to	1
the	1
door.	1
The	1
black	1
cloud	1
had	1
now	1
passed	1
over	1
the	1
moon,	1
and	1
the	1
light	1
shone	1
full	1
upon	1
them.	1
"What	1
do	1
we	1
stand	1
here	1
for?"	1
said	1
the	1
stable	1
boy,	1
snatching	1
the	1
flower-pot	1
out	1
of	1
Lawrence's	1
trembling	1
hands,	1
and	1
pulled	1
him	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
door.	1
"Good	1
God!"	1
cried	1
Lawrence,	1
"you	1
won't	1
take	1
all.	1
You	1
said	1
you'd	1
only	1
take	1
half	1
a	1
crown,	1
and	1
pay	1
it	1
back	1
on	1
Monday.	1
You	1
said	1
you'd	1
only	1
take	1
half	1
a	1
crown!"	1
"Hold	1
your	1
tongue,"	1
replied	1
the	1
other,	1
walking	1
on,	1
deaf	1
to	1
all	1
remonstrances--"if	1
ever	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
be	1
hanged,	1
it	1
sha'n't	1
be	1
for	1
half	1
a	1
crown."	1
Lawrence's	1
blood	1
ran	1
cold	1
in	1
his	1
veins,	1
and	1
he	1
felt	1
as	1
if	1
all	1
his	1
hair	1
stood	1
on	1
end.	1
Not	1
another	1
word	1
passed.	1
His	1
accomplice	1
carried	1
off	1
the	1
money,	1
and	1
Lawrence	1
crept,	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
horrors	1
of	1
guilt	1
upon	1
him,	1
to	1
his	1
restless	1
bed.	1
All	1
night	1
he	1
was	1
starting	1
from	1
frightful	1
dreams;	1
or	1
else,	1
broad	1
awake,	1
he	1
lay	1
listening	1
to	1
every	1
small	1
noise,	1
unable	1
to	1
stir,	1
and	1
scarcely	1
daring	1
to	1
breathe--tormented	1
by	1
that	1
most	1
dreadful	1
of	1
all	1
kinds	1
of	1
fear,	1
that	1
fear	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
constant	1
companion	1
of	1
an	1
evil	1
conscience.	1
He	1
thought	1
the	1
morning	1
would	1
never	1
come;	1
but	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
day,	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
birds	1
sing,	1
and	1
saw	1
everything	1
look	1
cheerful	1
as	1
usual,	1
he	1
felt	1
still	1
more	1
miserable.	1
It	1
was	1
Sunday	1
morning,	1
and	1
the	1
bell	1
rang	1
for	1
church.	1
All	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
village,	1
dressed	1
in	1
their	1
Sunday	1
clothes,	1
innocent	1
and	1
gay,	1
and	1
little	1
Jem,	1
the	1
best	1
and	1
gayest	1
amongst	1
them,	1
went	1
flocking	1
by	1
his	1
door	1
to	1
church.	1
"Well,	1
Lawrence,"	1
said	1
Jem,	1
pulling	1
his	1
coat	1
as	1
he	1
passed	1
and	1
saw	1
Lawrence	1
leaning	1
against	1
his	1
father's	1
door,	1
"what	1
makes	1
you	1
look	1
so	1
black?"	1
"I?"	1
said	1
Lawrence,	1
starting;	1
"why	1
do	1
you	1
say	1
that	1
I	1
look	1
black?"	1
"Nay,	1
then,"	1
said	1
Jem,	1
"you	1
look	1
white	1
enough	1
now,	1
if	1
that	1
will	1
please	1
you,	1
for	1
you're	1
turned	1
as	1
pale	1
as	1
death."	1
"Pale?"	1
replied	1
Lawrence,	1
not	1
knowing	1
what	1
he	1
said,	1
and	1
turned	1
abruptly	1
away,	1
for	1
he	1
dared	1
not	1
stand	1
another	1
look	1
of	1
Jem's;	1
conscious	1
that	1
guilt	1
was	1
written	1
in	1
his	1
face,	1
he	1
shunned	1
every	1
eye.	1
He	1
would	1
now	1
have	1
given	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
have	1
thrown	1
off	1
the	1
load	1
of	1
guilt	1
which	1
lay	1
upon	1
his	1
mind.	1
He	1
longed	1
to	1
follow	1
Jem,	1
to	1
fall	1
upon	1
his	1
knees	1
and	1
confess	1
all.	1
Dreading	1
the	1
moment	1
when	1
Jem	1
should	1
discover	1
his	1
loss,	1
Lawrence	1
dared	1
not	1
stay	1
at	1
home,	1
and	1
not	1
knowing	1
what	1
to	1
do,	1
or	1
where	1
to	1
go,	1
he	1
mechanically	1
went	1
to	1
his	1
old	1
haunt	1
at	1
the	1
stable	1
yard,	1
and	1
lurked	1
thereabouts	1
all	1
day	1
with	1
his	1
accomplice,	1
who	1
tried	1
in	1
vain	1
to	1
quiet	1
his	1
fears	1
and	1
raise	1
his	1
spirits	1
by	1
talking	1
of	1
the	1
next	1
day's	1
cock-fight.	1
It	1
was	1
agreed	1
that	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
dusk	1
of	1
the	1
evening	1
came	1
on,	1
they	1
should	1
go	1
together	1
into	1
a	1
certain	1
lonely	1
field,	1
and	1
there	1
divide	1
their	1
booty.	1
In	1
the	1
meantime,	1
Jem,	1
when	1
he	1
returned	1
from	1
church,	1
was	1
very	1
full	1
of	1
business,	1
preparing	1
for	1
the	1
reception	1
of	1
his	1
mistress,	1
of	1
whose	1
intended	1
visit	1
he	1
had	1
informed	1
his	1
mother;	1
and	1
whilst	1
she	1
was	1
arranging	1
the	1
kitchen	1
and	1
their	1
little	1
parlour,	1
he	1
ran	1
to	1
search	1
the	1
strawberry	1
beds.	1
"Why,	1
my	1
Jem,	1
how	1
merry	1
you	1
are	1
to-day!"	1
said	1
his	1
mother,	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
in	1
with	1
the	1
strawberries,	1
and	1
was	1
jumping	1
about	1
the	1
room	1
playfully.	1
"Now,	1
keep	1
those	1
spirits	1
of	1
yours,	1
Jem,	1
till	1
you	1
want	1
'em,	1
and	1
don't	1
let	1
it	1
come	1
upon	1
you	1
all	1
at	1
once.	1
Have	1
it	1
in	1
mind	1
that	1
to-morrow's	1
fair	1
day,	1
and	1
Lightfoot	1
must	1
go.	1
I	1
bid	1
Farmer	1
Truck	1
call	1
for	1
him	1
to-night.	1
He	1
said	1
he'd	1
take	1
him	1
along	1
with	1
his	1
own,	1
and	1
he'll	1
be	1
here	1
just	1
now--and	1
then	1
I	1
know	1
how	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
with	1
you,	1
Jem!"	1
"So	1
do	1
I!"	1
cried	1
Jem,	1
swallowing	1
his	1
secret	1
with	1
great	1
difficulty,	1
and	1
then	1
tumbling	1
head	1
over	1
heels	1
four	1
times	1
running.	1
A	1
carriage	1
passed	1
the	1
window,	1
and	1
stopped	1
at	1
the	1
door.	1
Jem	1
ran	1
out;	1
it	1
was	1
his	1
mistress.	1
She	1
came	1
in	1
smiling,	1
and	1
soon	1
made	1
the	1
old	1
woman	1
smile,	1
too,	1
by	1
praising	1
the	1
neatness	1
of	1
everything	1
in	1
the	1
house.	1
We	1
shall	1
pass	1
over,	1
however	1
important	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
deemed	1
at	1
the	1
time,	1
the	1
praises	1
of	1
the	1
strawberries,	1
and	1
of	1
"my	1
grandmother's	1
china	1
plate."	1
Another	1
knock	1
was	1
heard	1
at	1
the	1
door.	1
"Run,	1
Jem,"	1
said	1
his	1
mother.	1
"I	1
hope	1
it's	1
our	1
milk-woman	1
with	1
cream	1
for	1
the	1
lady."	1
No;	1
it	1
was	1
Farmer	1
Truck	1
come	1
for	1
Lightfoot.	1
The	1
old	1
woman's	1
countenance	1
fell.	1
"Fetch	1
him	1
out,	1
dear,"	1
said	1
she,	1
turning	1
to	1
her	1
son;	1
but	1
Jem	1
was	1
gone;	1
he	1
flew	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
stable	1
the	1
moment	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
flap	1
of	1
Farmer	1
Truck's	1
great-coat.	1
"Sit	1
ye	1
down,	1
farmer,"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
woman,	1
after	1
they	1
had	1
waited	1
about	1
five	1
minutes	1
in	1
expectation	1
of	1
Jem's	1
return.	1
"You'd	1
best	1
sit	1
down,	1
if	1
the	1
lady	1
will	1
give	1
you	1
leave;	1
for	1
he'll	1
not	1
hurry	1
himself	1
back	1
again.	1
My	1
boy's	1
a	1
fool,	1
madam,	1
about	1
that	1
there	1
horse."	1
Trying	1
to	1
laugh,	1
she	1
added,	1
"I	1
knew	1
how	1
Lightfoot	1
and	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
loath	1
enough	1
to	1
part.	1
He	1
won't	1
bring	1
him	1
out	1
till	1
the	1
last	1
minute;	1
so	1
do	1
sit	1
ye	1
down,	1
neighbour."	1
The	1
farmer	1
had	1
scarcely	1
sat	1
down	1
when	1
Jem,	1
with	1
a	1
pale,	1
wild	1
countenance	1
came	1
back.	1
"What's	1
the	1
matter?"	1
said	1
his	1
mistress.	1
"God	1
bless	1
the	1
boy!"	1
said	1
his	1
mother,	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
quite	1
frightened,	1
whilst	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
speak,	1
but	1
could	1
not.	1
She	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
then	1
leaning	1
his	1
head	1
against	1
her,	1
he	1
cried,	1
"It's	1
gone!--it's	1
all	1
gone!"	1
and,	1
bursting	1
into	1
tears,	1
he	1
sobbed	1
as	1
if	1
his	1
little	1
heart	1
would	1
break.	1
"What's	1
gone,	1
love?"	1
said	1
his	1
mother.	1
"My	1
two	1
guineas--Lightfoot's	1
two	1
guineas.	1
I	1
went	1
to	1
fetch	1
'em	1
to	1
give	1
you,	1
mammy;	1
but	1
the	1
broken	1
flower-pot	1
that	1
I	1
put	1
them	1
in,	1
and	1
all's	1
gone!--quite	1
gone!"	1
repeated	1
he,	1
checking	1
his	1
sobs.	1
"I	1
saw	1
them	1
safe	1
last	1
night,	1
and	1
was	1
showing	1
'em	1
to	1
Lightfoot;	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
so	1
glad	1
to	1
think	1
I	1
had	1
earned	1
them	1
all	1
myself;	1
and	1
I	1
thought	1
how	1
surprised	1
you'd	1
look,	1
and	1
how	1
glad	1
you'd	1
be,	1
and	1
how	1
you'd	1
kiss	1
me,	1
and	1
all!"	1
His	1
mother	1
listened	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
greatest	1
surprise,	1
whilst	1
his	1
mistress	1
stood	1
in	1
silence,	1
looking	1
first	1
at	1
the	1
old	1
woman,	1
and	1
then	1
at	1
Jem	1
with	1
a	1
penetrating	1
eye,	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
suspected	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
his	1
story,	1
and	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
becoming	1
the	1
dupe	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
compassion.	1
"This	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
strange	1
thing!"	1
said	1
she,	1
gravely.	1
"How	1
came	1
you	1
to	1
leave	1
all	1
your	1
money	1
in	1
a	1
broken	1
flower-pot	1
in	1
the	1
stable?	1
How	1
came	1
you	1
not	1
to	1
give	1
it	1
to	1
your	1
mother	1
to	1
take	1
care	1
of?"	1
"Why,	1
don't	1
you	1
remember?"	1
said	1
Jem,	1
looking	1
up,	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
his	1
tears--"why,	1
don't	1
you	1
remember	1
you,	1
your	1
own	1
self,	1
bid	1
me	1
not	1
tell	1
her	1
about	1
it	1
till	1
you	1
were	1
by?"	1
"And	1
did	1
you	1
not	1
tell	1
her?"	1
"Nay,	1
ask	1
mammy,"	1
said	1
Jem,	1
a	1
little	1
offended;	1
and	1
when	1
afterwards	1
the	1
lady	1
went	1
on	1
questioning	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
severe	1
manner,	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
believe	1
him,	1
he	1
at	1
last	1
made	1
no	1
answer.	1
"Oh,	1
Jem!	1
Jem!	1
why	1
don't	1
you	1
speak	1
to	1
the	1
lady?"	1
said	1
his	1
mother.	1
"I	1
have	1
spoke,	1
and	1
spoke	1
the	1
truth,"	1
said	1
Jem,	1
proudly;	1
"and	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
believe	1
me."	1
Still	1
the	1
lady,	1
who	1
had	1
lived	1
too	1
long	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
be	1
without	1
suspicion,	1
maintained	1
a	1
cold	1
manner,	1
and	1
determined	1
to	1
wait	1
the	1
event	1
without	1
interfering,	1
saying	1
only,	1
that	1
she	1
hoped	1
the	1
money	1
would	1
be	1
found,	1
and	1
advised	1
Jem	1
to	1
have	1
done	1
crying.	1
"I	1
have	1
done,"	1
said	1
Jem;	1
"I	1
shall	1
cry	1
no	1
more."	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
greatest	1
command	1
over	1
himself,	1
he	1
actually	1
did	1
not	1
shed	1
another	1
tear,	1
not	1
even	1
when	1
the	1
farmer	1
got	1
up	1
to	1
go,	1
saying,	1
he	1
could	1
wait	1
no	1
longer.	1
Jem	1
silently	1
went	1
to	1
bring	1
out	1
Lightfoot.	1
The	1
lady	1
now	1
took	1
her	1
seat,	1
where	1
she	1
could	1
see	1
all	1
that	1
passed	1
at	1
the	1
open	1
parlour-window.	1
The	1
old	1
woman	1
stood	1
at	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
several	1
idle	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
village,	1
who	1
had	1
gathered	1
round	1
the	1
lady's	1
carriage	1
examining	1
it,	1
turned	1
about	1
to	1
listen.	1
In	1
a	1
minute	1
or	1
two	1
Jem	1
appeared,	1
with	1
a	1
steady	1
countenance,	1
leading	1
Lightfoot	1
and,	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
up,	1
without	1
saying	1
a	1
word,	1
put	1
the	1
bridle	1
into	1
Farmer	1
Truck's	1
hand.	1
"He	1
HAS	1
BEEN	1
a	1
good	1
horse,"	1
said	1
the	1
farmer.	1
"He	1
IS	1
a	1
good	1
horse!"	1
cried	1
Jem,	1
and	1
threw	1
his	1
arm	1
over	1
Lightfoot's	1
neck,	1
hiding	1
his	1
own	1
face	1
as	1
he	1
leaned	1
upon	1
him.	1
At	1
this	1
instant	1
a	1
party	1
of	1
milk-women	1
went	1
by;	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
them,	1
having	1
set	1
down	1
her	1
pail,	1
came	1
behind	1
Jem,	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
pretty	1
smart	1
blow	1
upon	1
the	1
back.	1
He	1
looked	1
up.	1
"And	1
don't	1
you	1
know	1
me?"	1
said	1
she.	1
"I	1
forget,"	1
said	1
Jem;	1
"I	1
think	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
your	1
face	1
before,	1
but	1
I	1
forget."	1
"Do	1
you	1
so?	1
and	1
you'll	1
tell	1
me	1
just	1
now,"	1
said	1
she,	1
half	1
opening	1
her	1
hand,	1
"that	1
you	1
forget	1
who	1
gave	1
you	1
this,	1
and	1
who	1
charged	1
you	1
not	1
to	1
part	1
with	1
it,	1
too."	1
Here	1
she	1
quite	1
opened	1
her	1
large	1
hand,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
palm	1
of	1
it	1
appeared	1
Jem's	1
silver	1
penny.	1
"Where?"	1
exclaimed	1
Jem,	1
seizing	1
it,	1
"oh,	1
where	1
did	1
you	1
find	1
it?	1
and	1
have	1
you--oh,	1
tell	1
me,	1
have	1
you	1
got	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
my	1
money?"	1
"I	1
know	1
nothing	1
of	1
your	1
money--I	1
don't	1
know	1
what	1
you	1
would	1
be	1
at,"	1
said	1
the	1
milk-woman.	1
"But	1
where--pray	1
tell	1
me	1
where--did	1
you	1
find	1
this?"	1
"With	1
them	1
that	1
you	1
gave	1
it	1
to,	1
I	1
suppose,"	1
said	1
the	1
milk-woman,	1
turning	1
away	1
suddenly	1
to	1
take	1
up	1
her	1
milk-pail.	1
But	1
now	1
Jem's	1
mistress	1
called	1
to	1
her	1
through	1
the	1
window,	1
begging	1
her	1
to	1
stop,	1
and	1
joining	1
in	1
his	1
entreaties	1
to	1
know	1
how	1
she	1
came	1
by	1
the	1
silver	1
penny.	1
"Why,	1
madam,"	1
said	1
she,	1
taking	1
up	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
her	1
apron,	1
"I	1
came	1
by	1
it	1
in	1
an	1
odd	1
way,	1
too.	1
You	1
must	1
know	1
my	1
Betty	1
is	1
sick,	1
so	1
I	1
came	1
with	1
the	1
milk	1
myself,	1
though	1
it's	1
not	1
what	1
I'm	1
used	1
to;	1
for	1
my	1
Betty--you	1
know	1
my	1
Betty?"	1
said	1
she,	1
turning	1
round	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
woman,	1
"my	1
Betty	1
serves	1
you,	1
and	1
she's	1
a	1
tight	1
and	1
stirring	1
lassy,	1
ma'am,	1
I	1
can	1
assure--"	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
don't	1
doubt	1
it,"	1
said	1
the	1
lady,	1
impatiently;	1
"but	1
about	1
the	1
silver	1
penny?"	1
"Why,	1
that's	1
true;	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
coming	1
along	1
all	1
alone,	1
for	1
the	1
rest	1
came	1
round,	1
and	1
I	1
came	1
a	1
short	1
cut	1
across	1
yon	1
field--no,	1
you	1
can't	1
see	1
it,	1
madam,	1
where	1
you	1
stand--but	1
if	1
you	1
were	1
here--"	1
"I	1
see	1
it--I	1
know	1
it,"	1
said	1
Jem,	1
out	1
of	1
breath	1
with	1
anxiety.	1
"Well--well--I	1
rested	1
my	1
pail	1
upon	1
the	1
stile,	1
and	1
sets	1
me	1
down	1
awhile,	1
and	1
there	1
comes	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hedge--I	1
don't	1
know	1
well	1
how,	1
for	1
they	1
startled	1
me	1
so	1
I'd	1
liked	1
to	1
have	1
thrown	1
down	1
my	1
milk--two	1
boys,	1
one	1
about	1
the	1
size	1
of	1
he,"	1
said	1
she	1
pointing	1
to	1
Jem,	1
"and	1
one	1
a	1
matter	1
taller,	1
but	1
ill-looking	1
like;	1
so	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
to	1
stir	1
to	1
make	1
way	1
for	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
like	1
in	1
a	1
desperate	1
hurry:	1
so,	1
without	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
stile,	1
one	1
of	1
'em	1
pulled	1
at	1
the	1
gate,	1
and	1
when	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
open	1
(for	1
it	1
was	1
tied	1
with	1
a	1
pretty	1
stout	1
cord)	1
one	1
of	1
'em	1
whips	1
out	1
with	1
his	1
knife	1
and	1
cuts	1
it--	1
Now,	1
have	1
you	1
a	1
knife	1
about	1
you,	1
sir?"	1
continued	1
the	1
milk	1
woman	1
to	1
the	1
farmer.	1
He	1
gave	1
her	1
his	1
knife.	1
"Here,	1
now,	1
ma'am,	1
just	1
sticking,	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
here,	1
between	1
the	1
blade	1
and	1
the	1
haft,	1
was	1
the	1
silver	1
penny.	1
The	1
lad	1
took	1
no	1
notice;	1
but	1
when	1
he	1
opened	1
it,	1
out	1
it	1
falls.	1
Still	1
he	1
takes	1
no	1
heed,	1
but	1
cuts	1
the	1
cord,	1
as	1
I	1
said	1
before,	1
and	1
through	1
the	1
gate	1
they	1
went,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
sight	1
in	1
half	1
a	1
minute.	1
I	1
picks	1
up	1
the	1
penny,	1
for	1
my	1
heart	1
misgave	1
me	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
very	1
one	1
husband	1
had	1
had	1
a	1
long	1
time,	1
and	1
had	1
given	1
against	1
my	1
voice	1
to	1
he,"	1
pointing	1
to	1
Jem;	1
"and	1
I	1
charged	1
him	1
not	1
to	1
part	1
with	1
it;	1
and,	1
ma'am,	1
when	1
I	1
looked	1
I	1
knew	1
it	1
by	1
the	1
mark,	1
so	1
I	1
thought	1
I	1
would	1
show	1
it	1
to	1
HE,"	1
again	1
pointing	1
to	1
Jem,	1
"and	1
let	1
him	1
give	1
it	1
back	1
to	1
those	1
it	1
belongs	1
to."	1
"It	1
belongs	1
to	1
me,"	1
said	1
Jem,	1
"I	1
never	1
gave	1
it	1
to	1
anybody--but--"	1
"But,"	1
cried	1
the	1
farmer,	1
"those	1
boys	1
have	1
robbed	1
him;	1
it	1
is	1
they	1
who	1
have	1
all	1
his	1
money."	1
"Oh,	1
which	1
way	1
did	1
they	1
go?"	1
cried	1
Jem,	1
"I'll	1
run	1
after	1
them."	1
"No,	1
no,"	1
said	1
the	1
lady,	1
calling	1
to	1
her	1
servant;	1
and	1
she	1
desired	1
him	1
to	1
take	1
his	1
horse	1
and	1
ride	1
after	1
them.	1
"Ay,"	1
added	1
Farmer	1
Truck,	1
"do	1
you	1
take	1
the	1
road,	1
and	1
I'll	1
take	1
the	1
field	1
way,	1
and	1
I'll	1
be	1
bound	1
we'll	1
have	1
'em	1
presently."	1
Whilst	1
they	1
were	1
gone	1
in	1
pursuit	1
of	1
the	1
thieves,	1
the	1
lady,	1
who	1
was	1
now	1
thoroughly	1
convinced	1
of	1
Jem's	1
truth,	1
desired	1
her	1
coachman	1
would	1
produce	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
ordered	1
him	1
to	1
bring	1
with	1
him	1
that	1
evening.	1
Out	1
of	1
the	1
boot	1
of	1
the	1
carriage	1
the	1
coachman	1
immediately	1
produced	1
a	1
new	1
saddle	1
and	1
bridle.	1
How	1
Jem's	1
eyes	1
sparkled	1
when	1
the	1
saddle	1
was	1
thrown	1
upon	1
Lightfoot's	1
back!	1
"Put	1
it	1
on	1
your	1
horse	1
yourself,	1
Jem,"	1
said	1
the	1
lady;	1
"it	1
is	1
yours."	1
Confused	1
reports	1
of	1
Lightfoot's	1
splendid	1
accoutrements,	1
of	1
the	1
pursuit	1
of	1
thieves,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
fine	1
and	1
generous	1
lady	1
who	1
was	1
standing	1
at	1
Dame	1
Preston's	1
window,	1
quickly	1
spread	1
through	1
the	1
village,	1
and	1
drew	1
everybody	1
from	1
their	1
houses.	1
They	1
crowded	1
round	1
Jem	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
story.	1
The	1
children	1
especially,	1
who	1
were	1
fond	1
of	1
him,	1
expressed	1
the	1
strongest	1
indignation	1
against	1
the	1
thieves.	1
Every	1
eye	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
stretch;	1
and	1
now	1
some,	1
who	1
had	1
run	1
down	1
the	1
lane,	1
came	1
back	1
shouting,	1
"Here	1
they	1
are!	1
they've	1
got	1
the	1
thieves!"	1
The	1
footman	1
on	1
horseback	1
carried	1
one	1
boy	1
before	1
him;	1
and	1
the	1
farmer,	1
striding	1
along,	1
dragged	1
another.	1
The	1
latter	1
had	1
on	1
a	1
red	1
jacket,	1
which	1
little	1
Jem	1
immediately	1
recollected,	1
and	1
scarcely	1
dared	1
lift	1
his	1
eyes	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
boy	1
on	1
horseback.	1
"Good	1
God!"	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
himself,	1
"it	1
must	1
be--yet	1
surely	1
it	1
can't	1
be	1
Lawrence!"	1
The	1
footman	1
rode	1
on	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
the	1
people	1
would	1
let	1
him.	1
The	1
boy's	1
hat	1
was	1
slouched,	1
and	1
his	1
head	1
hung	1
down,	1
so	1
that	1
nobody	1
could	1
see	1
his	1
face.	1
At	1
this	1
instant	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
disturbance	1
in	1
the	1
crowd.	1
A	1
man	1
who	1
was	1
half	1
drunk	1
pushed	1
his	1
way	1
forwards,	1
swearing	1
that	1
nobody	1
should	1
stop	1
him;	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
right	1
to	1
see--and	1
he	1
WOULD	1
see.	1
And	1
so	1
he	1
did;	1
for,	1
forcing	1
through	1
all	1
resistance,	1
he	1
staggered	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
footman	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
lifting	1
down	1
the	1
boy	1
he	1
had	1
carried	1
before	1
him.	1
"I	1
WILL--I	1
tell	1
you	1
I	1
WILL	1
see	1
the	1
thief!"	1
cried	1
the	1
drunken	1
man,	1
pushing	1
up	1
the	1
boy's	1
hat.	1
It	1
was	1
his	1
own	1
son.	1
"Lawrence!"	1
exclaimed	1
the	1
wretched	1
father.	1
The	1
shock	1
sobered	1
him	1
at	1
once,	1
and	1
he	1
hid	1
his	1
face	1
in	1
his	1
hands.	1
There	1
was	1
an	1
awful	1
silence.	1
Lawrence	1
fell	1
on	1
his	1
knees,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
that	1
could	1
scarcely	1
be	1
heard	1
made	1
a	1
full	1
confession	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
circumstances	1
of	1
his	1
guilt.	1
"Such	1
a	1
young	1
creature	1
so	1
wicked!"	1
the	1
bystanders	1
exclaimed;	1
"what	1
could	1
put	1
such	1
wickedness	1
in	1
your	1
head?"	1
"Bad	1
company,"	1
said	1
Lawrence.	1
"And	1
how	1
came	1
you--what	1
brought	1
you	1
into	1
bad	1
company?"	1
"I	1
don't	1
know,	1
except	1
it	1
was	1
idleness."	1
While	1
this	1
was	1
saying	1
the	1
farmer	1
was	1
emptying	1
Lazy	1
Lawrence's	1
pockets;	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
money	1
appeared,	1
all	1
his	1
former	1
companions	1
in	1
the	1
village	1
looked	1
at	1
each	1
other	1
with	1
astonishment	1
and	1
terror.	1
Their	1
parents	1
grasped	1
their	1
little	1
hands	1
closer,	1
and	1
cried,	1
"Thank	1
God!	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
my	1
son.	1
How	1
often	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
little	1
we	1
used,	1
as	1
he	1
lounged	1
about,	1
to	1
tell	1
him	1
that	1
idleness	1
was	1
the	1
root	1
of	1
all	1
evil."	1
As	1
for	1
the	1
hardened	1
wretch,	1
his	1
accomplice,	1
everyone	1
was	1
impatient	1
to	1
have	1
him	1
sent	1
to	1
gaol.	1
He	1
put	1
on	1
a	1
bold,	1
insolent	1
countenance,	1
till	1
he	1
heard	1
Lawrence's	1
confession;	1
till	1
the	1
money	1
was	1
found	1
upon	1
him;	1
and	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
milk-woman	1
declare	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
swear	1
to	1
the	1
silver	1
penny	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
dropped.	1
Then	1
he	1
turned	1
pale,	1
and	1
betrayed	1
the	1
strongest	1
signs	1
of	1
fear.	1
"We	1
must	1
take	1
him	1
before	1
the	1
justice,"	1
said	1
the	1
farmer,	1
"and	1
he'll	1
be	1
lodged	1
in	1
Bristol	1
gaol."	1
"Oh!"	1
said	1
Jem,	1
springing	1
forwards	1
when	1
Lawrence's	1
hands	1
were	1
going	1
to	1
be	1
tied,	1
"let	1
him	1
go--won't	1
you?--can't	1
you	1
let	1
him	1
go?"	1
"Yes,	1
madam,	1
for	1
mercy's	1
sake,"	1
said	1
Jem's	1
mother	1
to	1
the	1
lady,	1
"think	1
what	1
a	1
disgrace	1
to	1
his	1
family	1
to	1
be	1
sent	1
to	1
gaol."	1
His	1
father	1
stood	1
by	1
wringing	1
his	1
hands	1
in	1
an	1
agony	1
of	1
despair.	1
"It's	1
all	1
my	1
fault,"	1
cried	1
he;	1
"I	1
brought	1
him	1
up	1
in	1
idleness."	1
"But	1
he'll	1
never	1
be	1
idle	1
any	1
more,"	1
said	1
Jem;	1
"won't	1
you	1
speak	1
for	1
him,	1
ma'am?"	1
"Don't	1
ask	1
the	1
lady	1
to	1
speak	1
for	1
him,"	1
said	1
the	1
farmer;	1
"it's	1
better	1
he	1
should	1
go	1
to	1
Bridewell	1
now,	1
than	1
to	1
the	1
gallows	1
by-and-by."	1
Nothing	1
more	1
was	1
said;	1
for	1
everybody	1
felt	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
the	1
farmer's	1
speech.	1
Lawrence	1
was	1
eventually	1
sent	1
to	1
Bridewell	1
for	1
a	1
month,	1
and	1
the	1
stable-boy	1
was	1
sent	1
for	1
trial,	1
convicted,	1
and	1
transported	1
to	1
Botany	1
Bay.	1
During	1
Lawrence's	1
confinement,	1
Jem	1
often	1
visited	1
him,	1
and	1
carried	1
him	1
such	1
little	1
presents	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
afford	1
to	1
give;	1
and	1
Jem	1
could	1
afford	1
to	1
be	1
GENEROUS,	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
INDUSTRIOUS.	1
Lawrence's	1
heart	1
was	1
touched	1
by	1
his	1
kindness,	1
and	1
his	1
example	1
struck	1
him	1
so	1
forcibly	1
that,	1
when	1
his	1
confinement	1
was	1
ended,	1
he	1
resolved	1
to	1
set	1
immediately	1
to	1
work;	1
and,	1
to	1
the	1
astonishment	1
of	1
all	1
who	1
knew	1
him,	1
soon	1
became	1
remarkable	1
for	1
industry.	1
He	1
was	1
found	1
early	1
and	1
late	1
at	1
his	1
work,	1
established	1
a	1
new	1
character,	1
and	1
for	1
ever	1
lost	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
"Lazy	1
Lawrence."	1
THE	1
FALSE	1
KEY.	1
Mr.	1
Spencer,	1
a	1
very	1
benevolent	1
and	1
sensible	1
man,	1
undertook	1
the	1
education	1
of	1
several	1
poor	1
children.	1
Among	1
the	1
rest	1
was	1
a	1
boy	1
of	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Franklin,	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
bred	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
time	1
he	1
was	1
five	1
years	1
old.	1
Franklin	1
had	1
the	1
misfortune	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
infamous	1
character;	1
and	1
for	1
many	1
years	1
this	1
was	1
a	1
disgrace	1
and	1
reproach	1
to	1
his	1
child.	1
When	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
neighbours'	1
children	1
quarrelled	1
with	1
him,	1
they	1
used	1
to	1
tell	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
turn	1
out	1
like	1
his	1
father.	1
But	1
Mr.	1
Spencer	1
always	1
assured	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
make	1
himself	1
whatever	1
he	1
pleased;	1
that	1
by	1
behaving	1
well	1
he	1
would	1
certainly,	1
sooner	1
or	1
later,	1
secure	1
the	1
esteem	1
and	1
love	1
of	1
all	1
who	1
knew	1
him,	1
even	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
the	1
strongest	1
prejudice	1
against	1
him	1
on	1
his	1
father's	1
account.	1
This	1
hope	1
was	1
very	1
delightful	1
to	1
Franklin,	1
and	1
he	1
showed	1
the	1
strongest	1
desire	1
to	1
learn	1
and	1
to	1
do	1
everything	1
that	1
was	1
right;	1
so	1
that	1
Mr.	1
Spencer	1
soon	1
grew	1
fond	1
of	1
him,	1
and	1
took	1
great	1
pains	1
to	1
instruct	1
him,	1
and	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
good	1
habits	1
and	1
principles	1
which	1
might	1
make	1
him	1
a	1
useful,	1
respectable	1
and	1
happy	1
man.	1
When	1
he	1
was	1
about	1
thirteen	1
years	1
of	1
age,	1
Mr.	1
Spencer	1
one	1
day	1
sent	1
for	1
him	1
into	1
his	1
closet;	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
folding	1
up	1
a	1
letter	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
writing,	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
with	1
a	1
very	1
kind	1
look,	1
but	1
in	1
a	1
graver	1
tone	1
than	1
usual,	1
"Franklin,	1
you	1
are	1
going	1
to	1
leave	1
me."	1
"Sir!"	1
said	1
Franklin.	1
"You	1
are	1
now	1
going	1
to	1
leave	1
me,	1
and	1
to	1
begin	1
the	1
world	1
for	1
yourself.	1
You	1
will	1
carry	1
this	1
letter	1
to	1
my	1
sister,	1
Mrs.	1
Churchill,	1
in	1
Queen's	1
Square.	1
You	1
know	1
Queen's	1
Square?"	1
Franklin	1
bowed.	1
"You	1
must	1
expect,"	1
continued	1
Mr.	1
Spencer,	1
"to	1
meet	1
with	1
several	1
disagreeable	1
things,	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
rough	1
work,	1
at	1
your	1
first	1
setting	1
out;	1
but	1
be	1
faithful	1
and	1
obedient	1
to	1
your	1
mistress,	1
and	1
obliging	1
to	1
your	1
fellow-servants,	1
and	1
all	1
will	1
go	1
well.	1
Mrs.	1
Churchill	1
will	1
make	1
you	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
mistress,	1
if	1
you	1
behave	1
properly;	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
doubt	1
but	1
you	1
will."	1
"Thank	1
you,	1
sir."	1
"And	1
you	1
will	1
always--I	1
mean,	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
you	1
deserve	1
it--find	1
a	1
friend	1
in	1
me."	1
"Thank	1
you,	1
sir--I	1
am	1
sure	1
you	1
are--"	1
There	1
Franklin	1
stopped	1
short,	1
for	1
the	1
recollection	1
of	1
all	1
Mr.	1
Spencer's	1
goodness	1
rushed	1
upon	1
him	1
at	1
once,	1
and	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
say	1
another	1
word.	1
"Bring	1
me	1
a	1
candle	1
to	1
seal	1
this	1
letter,"	1
said	1
his	1
master;	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
get	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room.	1
He	1
came	1
back	1
with	1
the	1
candle,	1
and,	1
with	1
a	1
stout	1
heart,	1
stood	1
by	1
whilst	1
the	1
letter	1
was	1
sealing;	1
and,	1
when	1
his	1
master	1
put	1
it	1
into	1
his	1
hand,	1
said,	1
in	1
a	1
cheerful	1
voice,	1
"I	1
hope	1
you	1
will	1
let	1
me	1
see	1
you	1
again,	1
sir,	1
sometimes."	1
"Certainly;	1
whenever	1
your	1
mistress	1
can	1
spare	1
you,	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
you;	1
and	1
remember,	1
if	1
ever	1
you	1
get	1
into	1
any	1
difficulty,	1
don't	1
be	1
afraid	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
me.	1
I	1
have	1
sometimes	1
spoken	1
harshly	1
to	1
you;	1
but	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
meet	1
with	1
a	1
more	1
indulgent	1
friend."	1
Franklin	1
at	1
this	1
turned	1
away	1
with	1
a	1
full	1
heart;	1
and,	1
after	1
making	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
attempts	1
to	1
express	1
his	1
gratitude,	1
left	1
the	1
room	1
without	1
being	1
able	1
to	1
speak.	1
He	1
got	1
to	1
Queen's	1
Square	1
about	1
three	1
o'clock.	1
The	1
door	1
was	1
opened	1
by	1
a	1
large,	1
red-faced	1
man,	1
in	1
a	1
blue	1
coat	1
and	1
scarlet	1
waistcoat,	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
felt	1
afraid	1
to	1
give	1
his	1
message,	1
lest	1
he	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
a	1
servant.	1
"Well,	1
what's	1
your	1
business,	1
sir?"	1
said	1
the	1
butler.	1
"I	1
have	1
a	1
letter	1
for	1
Mrs.	1
Churchill,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
Franklin,	1
endeavouring	1
to	1
pronounce	1
his	1
"sir"	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
as	1
respectful	1
as	1
the	1
butler's	1
was	1
insolent.	1
The	1
man	1
having	1
examined	1
the	1
direction,	1
seal,	1
and	1
edges	1
of	1
the	1
letter,	1
carried	1
it	1
upstairs,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
returned,	1
and	1
ordered	1
Franklin	1
to	1
rub	1
his	1
shoes	1
well	1
and	1
follow	1
him.	1
He	1
was	1
then	1
shown	1
into	1
a	1
handsome	1
room,	1
where	1
he	1
found	1
his	1
mistress--an	1
elderly	1
lady.	1
She	1
asked	1
him	1
a	1
few	1
questions,	1
examining	1
him	1
attentively	1
as	1
she	1
spoke;	1
and	1
her	1
severe	1
eye	1
at	1
first,	1
and	1
her	1
gracious	1
smile	1
afterwards,	1
made	1
him	1
feel	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
person	1
to	1
be	1
both	1
loved	1
and	1
feared.	1
"I	1
shall	1
give	1
you	1
in	1
charge,"	1
said	1
she,	1
ringing	1
a	1
bell,	1
"to	1
my	1
housekeeper,	1
and	1
I	1
hope	1
she	1
will	1
have	1
no	1
reason	1
to	1
be	1
displeased	1
with	1
you."	1
The	1
housekeeper,	1
when	1
she	1
first	1
came	1
in,	1
appeared	1
with	1
a	1
smiling	1
countenance;	1
but	1
the	1
moment	1
she	1
cast	1
her	1
eyes	1
on	1
Franklin,	1
it	1
changed	1
to	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
surprise	1
and	1
suspicion.	1
Her	1
mistress	1
recommended	1
him	1
to	1
her	1
protection,	1
saying,	1
"Pomfret,	1
I	1
hope	1
you	1
will	1
keep	1
this	1
boy	1
under	1
your	1
own	1
eye."	1
And	1
she	1
received	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
cold	1
"Very	1
well,	1
ma'am,"	1
which	1
plainly	1
showed	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
disposed	1
to	1
like	1
him.	1
In	1
fact,	1
Mrs.	1
Pomfret	1
was	1
a	1
woman	1
so	1
fond	1
of	1
power,	1
and	1
so	1
jealous	1
of	1
favour,	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
quarrelled	1
with	1
an	1
angel	1
who	1
had	1
got	1
so	1
near	1
her	1
mistress	1
without	1
her	1
introduction.	1
She	1
smothered	1
her	1
displeasure,	1
however,	1
till	1
night;	1
when,	1
as	1
she	1
attended	1
her	1
mistress'	1
toilette,	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
refrain	1
from	1
expressing	1
her	1
sentiments.	1
She	1
began	1
cautiously:	1
"Ma'am,	1
is	1
not	1
this	1
the	1
boy	1
Mr.	1
Spencer	1
was	1
talking	1
of	1
one	1
day--that	1
has	1
been	1
brought	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
VILLAINTROPIC	1
SOCIETY,	1
I	1
think	1
they	1
call	1
it?"	1
"Philanthropic	1
Society;	1
yes,"	1
said	1
her	1
mistress;	1
"and	1
my	1
brother	1
gives	1
him	1
a	1
high	1
character:	1
I	1
hope	1
he	1
will	1
do	1
very	1
well."	1
"I'm	1
sure	1
I	1
hope	1
so	1
too,"	1
observed	1
Mrs.	1
Pomfret;	1
"but	1
I	1
can't	1
say;	1
for	1
my	1
part,	1
I've	1
no	1
great	1
notion	1
of	1
those	1
low	1
people.	1
They	1
say	1
all	1
those	1
children	1
are	1
taken	1
from	1
the	1
very	1
lowest	1
DRUGS	1
and	1
REFUGES	1
of	1
the	1
town,	1
and	1
surely	1
they	1
are	1
like	1
enough,	1
ma'am,	1
to	1
take	1
after	1
their	1
own	1
fathers	1
and	1
mothers."	1
"But	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
suffered	1
to	1
be	1
with	1
their	1
parents,"	1
rejoined	1
the	1
lady;	1
"and	1
therefore	1
cannot	1
be	1
hurt	1
by	1
their	1
example.	1
This	1
little	1
boy,	1
to	1
be	1
sure,	1
was	1
unfortunate	1
in	1
his	1
father,	1
but	1
he	1
has	1
had	1
an	1
excellent	1
education."	1
"Oh,	1
EDICATION!	1
to	1
be	1
sure,	1
ma'am,	1
I	1
know.	1
I	1
don't	1
say	1
but	1
what	1
edication	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
thing.	1
But	1
then,	1
ma'am,	1
edication	1
can't	1
change	1
the	1
NATUR	1
that's	1
in	1
one,	1
they	1
say;	1
and	1
one's	1
that	1
born	1
naturally	1
bad	1
and	1
low,	1
they	1
say,	1
all	1
the	1
edication	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
won't	1
do	1
no	1
good;	1
and,	1
for	1
my	1
part,	1
ma'am,	1
I	1
know	1
you	1
knows	1
best;	1
but	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
afraid	1
to	1
let	1
any	1
of	1
those	1
Villaintropic	1
folks	1
get	1
into	1
my	1
house;	1
for	1
nobody	1
can	1
tell	1
the	1
natur	1
of	1
them	1
aforehand.	1
I	1
declare	1
it	1
frights	1
me."	1
"Pomfret,	1
I	1
thought	1
you	1
had	1
better	1
sense:	1
how	1
would	1
this	1
poor	1
boy	1
earn	1
his	1
bread?	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
forced	1
to	1
starve	1
or	1
steal,	1
if	1
everybody	1
had	1
such	1
prejudices."	1
Pomfret,	1
who	1
really	1
was	1
a	1
good	1
woman,	1
was	1
softened	1
at	1
this	1
idea,	1
and	1
said,	1
"God	1
forbid	1
he	1
should	1
starve	1
or	1
steal,	1
and	1
God	1
forbid	1
I	1
should	1
say	1
anything	1
PREJUDICIARY	1
of	1
the	1
boy;	1
for	1
there	1
may	1
be	1
no	1
harm	1
in	1
him."	1
"Well,"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Churchill,	1
changing	1
her	1
tone,	1
"but,	1
Pomfret,	1
if	1
we	1
don't	1
like	1
the	1
boy	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
month,	1
we	1
have	1
done	1
with	1
him;	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
only	1
promised	1
Mr.	1
Spencer	1
to	1
keep	1
him	1
a	1
month	1
upon	1
trial:	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
harm	1
done."	1
"Dear,	1
no,	1
ma'am,	1
to	1
be	1
sure;	1
and	1
cook	1
must	1
put	1
up	1
with	1
her	1
disappointment,	1
that's	1
all."	1
"What	1
disappointment?"	1
"About	1
her	1
nephew,	1
ma'am;	1
the	1
boy	1
she	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
speaking	1
to	1
you	1
for."	1
"When?"	1
"The	1
day	1
you	1
called	1
her	1
up	1
about	1
the	1
almond	1
pudding,	1
ma'am.	1
If	1
you	1
remember,	1
you	1
said	1
you	1
should	1
have	1
no	1
objections	1
to	1
try	1
the	1
boy;	1
and	1
upon	1
that	1
cook	1
bought	1
him	1
new	1
shirts;	1
but	1
they	1
are	1
to	1
the	1
good,	1
as	1
I	1
tell	1
her."	1
"But	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
promise	1
to	1
take	1
her	1
nephew."	1
"O,	1
no	1
ma'am,	1
not	1
at	1
all;	1
she	1
does	1
not	1
think	1
to	1
SAY	1
THAT,	1
else	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
very	1
angry;	1
but	1
the	1
poor	1
woman	1
never	1
let	1
fall	1
a	1
word,	1
any	1
more	1
than	1
frets	1
that	1
the	1
boy	1
should	1
miss	1
such	1
a	1
good	1
place."	1
"Well,	1
but	1
since	1
I	1
did	1
say	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
no	1
objection	1
to	1
try	1
him,	1
I	1
shall	1
keep	1
my	1
word;	1
let	1
him	1
come	1
to-morrow.	1
Let	1
them	1
both	1
have	1
a	1
fair	1
trial,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
month	1
I	1
can	1
decide	1
which	1
I	1
like	1
best,	1
and	1
which	1
we	1
had	1
better	1
keep."	1
Dismissed	1
with	1
these	1
orders,	1
Mrs.	1
Pomfret	1
hastened	1
to	1
report	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
passed	1
to	1
the	1
cook,	1
like	1
a	1
favourite	1
minister,	1
proud	1
to	1
display	1
the	1
extent	1
of	1
her	1
secret	1
influence.	1
In	1
the	1
morning	1
Felix,	1
the	1
cook's	1
nephew,	1
arrived;	1
and,	1
the	1
moment	1
he	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
kitchen,	1
every	1
eye,	1
even	1
the	1
scullion's,	1
was	1
fixed	1
upon	1
him	1
with	1
approbation,	1
and	1
afterwards	1
glanced	1
upon	1
Franklin	1
with	1
contempt--contempt	1
which	1
Franklin	1
could	1
not	1
endure	1
without	1
some	1
confusion,	1
though	1
quite	1
unconscious	1
of	1
having	1
deserved	1
it;	1
nor,	1
upon	1
the	1
most	1
impartial	1
and	1
cool	1
self-examination,	1
could	1
he	1
comprehend	1
the	1
justice	1
of	1
his	1
judges.	1
He	1
perceived	1
indeed--for	1
the	1
comparisons	1
were	1
minutely	1
made	1
in	1
audible	1
and	1
scornful	1
whispers--that	1
Felix	1
was	1
a	1
much	1
handsomer,	1
or	1
as	1
the	1
kitchen	1
maid	1
expressed	1
it,	1
a	1
much	1
more	1
genteeler	1
gentlemanly	1
looking	1
like	1
sort	1
of	1
person	1
than	1
he	1
was;	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
made	1
to	1
understand,	1
that	1
he	1
wanted	1
a	1
frill	1
to	1
his	1
shirt,	1
a	1
cravat,	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
thin	1
shoes,	1
and,	1
above	1
all,	1
shoe	1
strings,	1
besides	1
other	1
nameless	1
advantages,	1
which	1
justly	1
made	1
his	1
rival	1
the	1
admiration	1
of	1
the	1
kitchen.	1
However,	1
upon	1
calling	1
to	1
mind	1
all	1
that	1
his	1
friend	1
Mr.	1
Spencer	1
had	1
ever	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
recollect	1
his	1
having	1
warned	1
him	1
that	1
shoe	1
strings	1
were	1
indispensable	1
requisites	1
to	1
the	1
character	1
of	1
a	1
good	1
servant;	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
only	1
comfort	1
himself	1
with	1
resolving,	1
if	1
possible,	1
to	1
make	1
amends	1
for	1
these	1
deficiencies,	1
and	1
to	1
dissipate	1
the	1
prejudices	1
which	1
he	1
saw	1
were	1
formed	1
against	1
him,	1
by	1
the	1
strictest	1
adherence	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
his	1
tutor	1
had	1
taught	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
his	1
duty.	1
He	1
hoped	1
to	1
secure	1
the	1
approbation	1
of	1
his	1
mistress	1
by	1
scrupulous	1
obedience	1
to	1
all	1
her	1
commands,	1
and	1
faithful	1
care	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
belonged	1
to	1
her.	1
At	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
he	1
flattered	1
himself	1
he	1
should	1
win	1
the	1
goodwill	1
of	1
his	1
fellow	1
servants	1
by	1
showing	1
a	1
constant	1
desire	1
to	1
oblige	1
them.	1
He	1
pursued	1
this	1
plan	1
of	1
conduct	1
steadily	1
for	1
nearly	1
three	1
weeks,	1
and	1
found	1
that	1
he	1
succeeded	1
beyond	1
his	1
expectations	1
in	1
pleasing	1
his	1
mistress;	1
but	1
unfortunately	1
he	1
found	1
it	1
more	1
difficult	1
to	1
please	1
his	1
fellow	1
servants,	1
and	1
he	1
sometimes	1
offended	1
when	1
he	1
least	1
expected	1
it.	1
He	1
had	1
made	1
great	1
progress	1
in	1
the	1
affections	1
of	1
Corkscrew,	1
the	1
butler,	1
by	1
working	1
indeed	1
very	1
hard	1
for	1
him,	1
and	1
doing	1
every	1
day	1
at	1
least	1
half	1
his	1
business.	1
But	1
one	1
unfortunate	1
night	1
the	1
butler	1
was	1
gone	1
out;	1
the	1
bell	1
rang:	1
he	1
went	1
upstairs;	1
and	1
his	1
mistress	1
asking	1
where	1
Corkscrew	1
was,	1
he	1
answered	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
gone	1
out.	1
"Where	1
to!"	1
said	1
his	1
mistress.	1
"I	1
don't	1
know,"	1
answered	1
Franklin.	1
And,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
told	1
exactly	1
the	1
truth,	1
and	1
meant	1
to	1
do	1
no	1
harm,	1
he	1
was	1
surprised,	1
at	1
the	1
butler's	1
return,	1
when	1
he	1
repeated	1
to	1
him	1
what	1
had	1
passed,	1
at	1
receiving	1
a	1
sudden	1
box	1
on	1
the	1
ear,	1
and	1
the	1
appellation	1
of	1
a	1
mischievous,	1
impertinent,	1
mean-spirited	1
brat.	1
"Mischievous,	1
impertinent,	1
mean!"	1
repeated	1
Franklin	1
to	1
himself;	1
but,	1
looking	1
in	1
the	1
butler's	1
face,	1
which	1
was	1
a	1
deeper	1
scarlet	1
than	1
usual,	1
he	1
judged	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
far	1
from	1
sober,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
doubt	1
but	1
that	1
the	1
next	1
morning,	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
his	1
reason,	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
sensible	1
of	1
his	1
injustice,	1
and	1
apologize	1
for	1
his	1
box	1
of	1
the	1
ear.	1
But	1
no	1
apology	1
coming	1
all	1
day,	1
Franklin	1
at	1
last	1
ventured	1
to	1
request	1
an	1
explanation,	1
or	1
rather,	1
to	1
ask	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
best	1
do	1
on	1
the	1
next	1
occasion.	1
"Why,"	1
said	1
Corkscrew,	1
"when	1
mistress	1
asked	1
for	1
me,	1
how	1
came	1
you	1
to	1
say	1
I	1
was	1
gone	1
out?"	1
"Because,	1
you	1
know,	1
I	1
saw	1
you	1
go	1
out."	1
"And	1
when	1
she	1
asked	1
you	1
where	1
I	1
was	1
gone,	1
how	1
came	1
you	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
you	1
did	1
not	1
know?"	1
"Because,	1
indeed,	1
I	1
did	1
not."	1
"You	1
are	1
a	1
stupid	1
blockhead!	1
could	1
you	1
not	1
say	1
I	1
was	1
gone	1
to	1
the	1
washerwoman's?"	1
"But	1
WERE	1
you?"	1
said	1
Franklin.	1
"Was	1
I?"	1
cried	1
Corkscrew,	1
and	1
looked	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
struck	1
him	1
again;	1
"how	1
dare	1
you	1
give	1
me	1
the	1
lie,	1
Mr.	1
Hypocrite?	1
You	1
would	1
be	1
ready	1
enough,	1
I'll	1
be	1
bound,	1
to	1
make	1
excuses	1
for	1
yourself.	1
Why	1
are	1
not	1
mistress'	1
clogs	1
cleaned?	1
Go	1
along	1
and	1
blacken	1
'em,	1
this	1
minute,	1
and	1
send	1
Felix	1
to	1
me."	1
From	1
this	1
time	1
forward	1
Felix	1
alone	1
was	1
privileged	1
to	1
enter	1
the	1
butler's	1
pantry.	1
Felix	1
became	1
the	1
favourite	1
of	1
Corkscrew;	1
and,	1
though	1
Franklin	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
sought	1
to	1
pry	1
into	1
the	1
mysteries	1
of	1
their	1
private	1
conferences,	1
nor	1
ever	1
entered	1
without	1
knocking	1
at	1
the	1
door,	1
yet	1
it	1
was	1
his	1
fate	1
once	1
to	1
be	1
sent	1
of	1
a	1
message	1
at	1
an	1
unlucky	1
time;	1
and,	1
as	1
the	1
door	1
was	1
half	1
open,	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
avoid	1
seeing	1
Felix	1
drinking	1
a	1
bumper	1
of	1
red	1
liquor,	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
suspecting	1
to	1
be	1
wine;	1
and,	1
as	1
the	1
decanter,	1
which	1
usually	1
went	1
upstairs	1
after	1
dinner,	1
was	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
in	1
the	1
butler's	1
grasp,	1
without	1
any	1
stopper	1
in	1
it,	1
he	1
was	1
involuntarily	1
forced	1
to	1
suspect	1
they	1
were	1
drinking	1
his	1
mistress'	1
wine.	1
Nor	1
were	1
the	1
bumpers	1
of	1
port	1
the	1
only	1
unlawful	1
rewards	1
which	1
Felix	1
received:	1
his	1
aunt,	1
the	1
cook,	1
had	1
occasion	1
for	1
his	1
assistance,	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
many	1
delicious	1
douceurs	1
in	1
her	1
gift.	1
Many	1
a	1
handful	1
of	1
currants,	1
many	1
a	1
half-custard,	1
many	1
a	1
triangular	1
remnant	1
of	1
pie,	1
besides	1
the	1
choice	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
meal	1
at	1
breakfast,	1
dinner	1
and	1
supper,	1
fell	1
to	1
the	1
share	1
of	1
the	1
favourite	1
Felix;	1
whilst	1
Franklin	1
was	1
neglected,	1
though	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
utmost	1
pains	1
to	1
please	1
the	1
cook	1
in	1
all	1
honourable	1
service,	1
and,	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
hot,	1
angry,	1
or	1
hurried,	1
he	1
was	1
always	1
at	1
hand	1
to	1
help	1
her;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
hour	1
of	1
adversity,	1
when	1
the	1
clock	1
struck	1
five,	1
and	1
no	1
dinner	1
was	1
dished,	1
and	1
no	1
kitchen	1
maid	1
with	1
twenty	1
pair	1
of	1
hands	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
had,	1
Franklin	1
would	1
answer	1
to	1
her	1
call,	1
with	1
flowers	1
to	1
garnish	1
her	1
dishes,	1
and	1
presence	1
of	1
mind	1
to	1
know,	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
commotion,	1
where	1
everything	1
that	1
was	1
wanting	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
found;	1
so	1
that,	1
quick	1
as	1
lightning,	1
all	1
difficulties	1
vanished	1
before	1
him.	1
Yet	1
when	1
the	1
danger	1
was	1
over,	1
and	1
the	1
hour	1
of	1
adversity	1
had	1
past,	1
the	1
ungrateful	1
cook	1
would	1
forget	1
her	1
benefactor,	1
and,	1
when	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
his	1
supper	1
time,	1
would	1
throw	1
him,	1
with	1
a	1
carelessness	1
that	1
touched	1
him	1
sensibly,	1
anything	1
which	1
the	1
other	1
servants	1
were	1
too	1
nice	1
to	1
eat.	1
All	1
this	1
Franklin	1
bore	1
with	1
fortitude;	1
nor	1
did	1
he	1
envy	1
Felix	1
the	1
dainties	1
which	1
he	1
ate,	1
sometimes	1
close	1
beside	1
him:	1
"For,"	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
himself,	1
"I	1
have	1
a	1
clear	1
conscience,	1
and	1
that	1
is	1
more	1
than	1
Felix	1
can	1
have.	1
I	1
know	1
how	1
he	1
wins	1
cook's	1
favour	1
too	1
well,	1
and	1
I	1
fancy	1
I	1
know	1
how	1
I	1
have	1
offended	1
her;	1
for	1
since	1
the	1
day	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
basket,	1
she	1
has	1
done	1
nothing	1
but	1
huff	1
me."	1
The	1
history	1
of	1
the	1
basket	1
was	1
this.	1
Mrs.	1
Pomfret,	1
the	1
housekeeper,	1
had	1
several	1
times,	1
directly	1
and	1
indirectly,	1
given	1
the	1
world	1
below	1
to	1
understand	1
that	1
she	1
and	1
her	1
mistress	1
thought	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
prodigious	1
quantity	1
of	1
meat	1
eaten	1
of	1
late.	1
Now,	1
when	1
she	1
spoke,	1
it	1
was	1
usually	1
at	1
dinner	1
time;	1
she	1
always	1
looked,	1
or	1
Franklin	1
imagined	1
that	1
she	1
looked,	1
suspiciously	1
at	1
him.	1
Other	1
people	1
looked	1
more	1
maliciously;	1
but,	1
as	1
he	1
felt	1
himself	1
perfectly	1
innocent,	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
eating	1
his	1
dinner	1
in	1
silence.	1
But	1
at	1
length	1
it	1
was	1
time	1
to	1
explain.	1
One	1
Sunday	1
there	1
appeared	1
a	1
handsome	1
sirloin	1
of	1
beef,	1
which	1
before	1
noon	1
on	1
Monday	1
had	1
shrunk	1
almost	1
to	1
the	1
bare	1
bone,	1
and	1
presented	1
such	1
a	1
deplorable	1
spectacle	1
to	1
the	1
opening	1
eyes	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
Pomfret	1
that	1
her	1
long	1
smothered	1
indignation	1
burst	1
forth,	1
and	1
she	1
boldly	1
declared	1
she	1
was	1
now	1
certain	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
foul	1
play,	1
and	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
the	1
beef	1
found,	1
or	1
she	1
would	1
know	1
why.	1
She	1
spoke,	1
but	1
no	1
beef	1
appeared,	1
till	1
Franklin,	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
sudden	1
recollection,	1
cried,	1
"Did	1
not	1
I	1
see	1
something	1
like	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
beef	1
in	1
a	1
basket	1
in	1
the	1
dairy?--I	1
think--"	1
The	1
cook,	1
as	1
if	1
somebody	1
had	1
smote	1
her	1
a	1
deadly	1
blow,	1
grew	1
pale;	1
but,	1
suddenly	1
recovering	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
her	1
speech,	1
turned	1
upon	1
Franklin,	1
and,	1
with	1
a	1
voice	1
of	1
thunder,	1
gave	1
him	1
the	1
lie	1
direct;	1
and	1
forthwith,	1
taking	1
Mrs.	1
Pomfret	1
by	1
the	1
ruffle,	1
led	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
dairy,	1
declaring	1
she	1
could	1
defy	1
the	1
world--"that	1
so	1
she	1
could,	1
and	1
would."	1
"There,	1
ma'am,"	1
said	1
she	1
kicking	1
an	1
empty	1
basket	1
which	1
lay	1
on	1
the	1
floor--"there's	1
malice	1
for	1
you.	1
Ask	1
him	1
why	1
he	1
don't	1
show	1
you	1
the	1
beef	1
in	1
the	1
basket."	1
"I	1
thought	1
I	1
saw--"	1
poor	1
Franklin	1
began.	1
"You	1
thought	1
you	1
saw!"	1
cried	1
the	1
cook,	1
coming	1
close	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
kimboed	1
arms,	1
and	1
looking	1
like	1
a	1
dragon;	1
"and	1
pray,	1
sir,	1
what	1
business	1
has	1
such	1
a	1
one	1
as	1
you	1
to	1
think	1
you	1
see?	1
And	1
pray,	1
ma'am,	1
will	1
you	1
be	1
pleased	1
to	1
speak--perhaps,	1
ma'am,	1
he'll	1
condescend	1
to	1
obey	1
you--ma'am,	1
will	1
you	1
be	1
pleased	1
to	1
forbid	1
him	1
my	1
dairy?	1
for	1
here	1
he	1
comes	1
prying	1
and	1
spying	1
about;	1
and	1
how,	1
ma'am,	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
answer	1
for	1
my	1
butter	1
and	1
cream,	1
or	1
anything	1
at	1
all?	1
I'm	1
sure	1
it's	1
what	1
I	1
can't	1
pretend	1
to,	1
unless	1
you	1
do	1
me	1
the	1
justice	1
to	1
forbid	1
him	1
my	1
places."	1
Mrs.	1
Pomfret,	1
whose	1
eyes	1
were	1
blinded	1
by	1
her	1
prejudices	1
against	1
the	1
folks	1
of	1
the	1
"Villaintropic	1
Society,"	1
and	1
also	1
by	1
her	1
secret	1
jealousy	1
of	1
a	1
boy	1
whom	1
she	1
deemed	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
growing	1
favourite	1
of	1
her	1
mistress',	1
took	1
part	1
with	1
the	1
cook,	1
and	1
ended,	1
as	1
she	1
began,	1
with	1
a	1
firm	1
persuasion	1
that	1
Franklin	1
was	1
the	1
guilty	1
person.	1
"Let	1
him	1
alone,	1
let	1
him	1
alone!"	1
said	1
she;	1
"he	1
has	1
as	1
many	1
turns	1
and	1
windings	1
as	1
a	1
hare;	1
but	1
we	1
shall	1
catch	1
him	1
yet,	1
I'll	1
be	1
bound,	1
in	1
some	1
of	1
his	1
doublings.	1
I	1
knew	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
him	1
well	1
enough,	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
I	1
ever	1
set	1
my	1
eyes	1
upon	1
him;	1
but	1
mistress	1
shall	1
have	1
her	1
own	1
way,	1
and	1
see	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
it."	1
These	1
words,	1
and	1
the	1
bitter	1
sense	1
of	1
injustice,	1
drew	1
tears	1
at	1
length	1
fast	1
down	1
the	1
proud	1
cheek	1
of	1
Franklin,	1
which	1
might	1
possibly	1
have	1
touched	1
Mrs.	1
Pomfret,	1
if	1
Felix,	1
with	1
a	1
sneer,	1
had	1
not	1
called	1
them	1
CROCODILE	1
TEARS.	1
"Felix,	1
too!"	1
thought	1
he;	1
"this	1
is	1
too	1
much."	1
In	1
fact,	1
Felix	1
had	1
till	1
now	1
professed	1
himself	1
his	1
firm	1
ally,	1
and	1
had	1
on	1
his	1
part	1
received	1
from	1
Franklin	1
unequivocal	1
proofs	1
of	1
friendship;	1
for	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
told	1
that	1
every	1
other	1
morning,	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
Felix's	1
turn	1
to	1
get	1
breakfast,	1
Felix	1
never	1
was	1
up	1
in	1
decent	1
time,	1
and	1
must	1
inevitably	1
have	1
come	1
to	1
public	1
disgrace	1
if	1
Franklin	1
had	1
not	1
got	1
all	1
the	1
breakfast	1
things	1
ready	1
for	1
him,	1
the	1
bread	1
and	1
butter	1
spread,	1
and	1
the	1
toast	1
toasted;	1
and	1
had	1
not,	1
moreover,	1
regularly,	1
when	1
the	1
clock	1
struck	1
eight,	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Pomfret's	1
foot	1
was	1
heard	1
overhead,	1
run	1
to	1
call	1
the	1
sleeping	1
Felix,	1
and	1
helped	1
him	1
constantly	1
through	1
the	1
hurry	1
of	1
getting	1
dressed	1
one	1
instant	1
before	1
the	1
housekeeper	1
came	1
downstairs.	1
All	1
this	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
be	1
present	1
to	1
his	1
memory;	1
but,	1
seeming	1
to	1
reproach	1
him,	1
Franklin	1
wiped	1
away	1
his	1
crocodile	1
tears,	1
and	1
preserved	1
a	1
magnanimous	1
silence.	1
The	1
hour	1
of	1
retribution	1
was,	1
however,	1
not	1
so	1
far	1
off	1
as	1
Felix	1
imagined.	1
Cunning	1
people	1
may	1
go	1
on	1
cleverly	1
in	1
their	1
devices	1
for	1
some	1
time;	1
but	1
although	1
they	1
may	1
escape	1
once,	1
twice,	1
perhaps	1
ninety-nine	1
times,	1
what	1
does	1
that	1
signify?--for	1
the	1
hundredth	1
time	1
they	1
come	1
to	1
shame,	1
and	1
lose	1
all	1
their	1
character.	1
Grown	1
bold	1
by	1
frequent	1
success,	1
Felix	1
became	1
more	1
careless	1
in	1
his	1
operations;	1
and	1
it	1
happened	1
that	1
one	1
day	1
he	1
met	1
his	1
mistress	1
full	1
in	1
the	1
passage,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
cook's	1
secret	1
errands.	1
"Where	1
are	1
you	1
going,	1
Felix?"	1
said	1
his	1
mistress.	1
"To	1
the	1
washerwoman's,	1
ma'am,"	1
answered	1
he,	1
with	1
his	1
usual	1
effrontery.	1
"Very	1
well,"	1
said	1
she.	1
"Call	1
at	1
the	1
bookseller's	1
in--stay,	1
I	1
must	1
write	1
down	1
the	1
direction.	1
Pomfret,"	1
said	1
she,	1
opening	1
the	1
housekeeper's	1
room	1
door,	1
"have	1
you	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
paper?"	1
Pomfret	1
came	1
with	1
the	1
writing-paper,	1
and	1
looked	1
very	1
angry	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
Felix	1
was	1
going	1
out	1
without	1
her	1
knowledge;	1
so,	1
while	1
Mrs.	1
Churchill	1
was	1
writing	1
the	1
direction,	1
she	1
stood	1
talking	1
to	1
him	1
about	1
it;	1
whilst	1
he,	1
in	1
the	1
greatest	1
terror	1
imaginable,	1
looked	1
up	1
in	1
her	1
face	1
as	1
she	1
spoke;	1
but	1
was	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
intent	1
on	1
parrying	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
the	1
attacks	1
of	1
a	1
little	1
French	1
dog	1
of	1
his	1
mistress',	1
which,	1
unluckily	1
for	1
him,	1
had	1
followed	1
her	1
into	1
the	1
passage.	1
Manchon	1
was	1
extremely	1
fond	1
of	1
Felix,	1
who,	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
pleasing	1
his	1
mistress,	1
had	1
paid	1
most	1
assiduous	1
court	1
to	1
her	1
dog;	1
yet	1
now	1
his	1
caresses	1
were	1
rather	1
troublesome.	1
Manchon	1
leaped	1
up,	1
and	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
rebuffed.	1
"Poor	1
fellow--poor	1
fellow--down!	1
down!	1
poor	1
fellow!"	1
cried	1
Felix,	1
and	1
put	1
him	1
away.	1
But	1
Manchon	1
leaped	1
up	1
again,	1
and	1
began	1
smelling	1
near	1
the	1
fatal	1
pocket	1
in	1
a	1
most	1
alarming	1
manner.	1
"You	1
will	1
see	1
by	1
this	1
direction	1
where	1
you	1
are	1
to	1
go,"	1
said	1
his	1
mistress.	1
"Manchon,	1
come	1
here--and	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
so	1
good	1
as	1
to	1
bring	1
me--down!	1
down!	1
Manchon,	1
be	1
quiet!"	1
But	1
Manchon	1
knew	1
better--he	1
had	1
now	1
got	1
his	1
head	1
into	1
Felix's	1
pocket,	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
quiet	1
till	1
he	1
had	1
drawn	1
from	1
thence,	1
rustling	1
out	1
of	1
its	1
brown	1
paper,	1
half	1
a	1
cold	1
turkey,	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
missing	1
since	1
morning.	1
"My	1
cold	1
turkey,	1
as	1
I'm	1
alive!"	1
exclaimed	1
the	1
housekeeper,	1
darting	1
upon	1
it	1
with	1
horror	1
and	1
amazement.	1
"What	1
is	1
all	1
this?"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Churchill,	1
in	1
a	1
composed	1
voice.	1
"I	1
don't	1
know,	1
ma'am,"	1
answered	1
Felix,	1
so	1
confused	1
that	1
he	1
knew	1
not	1
what	1
to	1
say;	1
"but--"	1
"But	1
what?"	1
cried	1
Mrs.	1
Pomfret,	1
indignation	1
flashing	1
from	1
her	1
eyes.	1
"But	1
what?"	1
repeated	1
his	1
mistress,	1
waiting	1
for	1
his	1
reply	1
with	1
a	1
calm	1
air	1
of	1
attention,	1
which	1
still	1
more	1
disconcerted	1
Felix;	1
for,	1
though	1
with	1
an	1
angry	1
person	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
some	1
chance	1
of	1
escape,	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
invent	1
any	1
excuse	1
in	1
such	1
circumstances,	1
which	1
could	1
stand	1
the	1
examination	1
of	1
a	1
person	1
in	1
her	1
sober	1
senses.	1
He	1
was	1
struck	1
dumb.	1
"Speak,"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Churchill,	1
in	1
a	1
still	1
lower	1
tone;	1
"I	1
am	1
ready	1
to	1
hear	1
all	1
you	1
have	1
to	1
say.	1
In	1
my	1
house	1
everybody	1
shall	1
have	1
justice;	1
speak--	1
but	1
what?"	1
"BUT,"	1
stammered	1
Felix;	1
and,	1
after	1
in	1
vain	1
attempting	1
to	1
equivocate,	1
confessed	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
turkey	1
to	1
his	1
cousin's;	1
but	1
he	1
threw	1
all	1
the	1
blame	1
upon	1
his	1
aunt,	1
the	1
cook,	1
who,	1
he	1
said,	1
had	1
ordered	1
him	1
upon	1
this	1
expedition.	1
The	1
cook	1
was	1
now	1
summoned;	1
but	1
she	1
totally	1
denied	1
all	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
affair,	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
violence	1
with	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
lately	1
confounded	1
Franklin	1
about	1
the	1
beef	1
in	1
the	1
basket;	1
not	1
entirely,	1
however,	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
success;	1
for	1
Felix,	1
perceiving	1
by	1
his	1
mistress'	1
eye	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
desiring	1
him	1
to	1
leave	1
the	1
house	1
immediately;	1
and	1
not	1
being	1
very	1
willing	1
to	1
leave	1
a	1
place	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
lived	1
so	1
well	1
with	1
the	1
butler,	1
did	1
not	1
hesitate	1
to	1
confront	1
his	1
aunt	1
with	1
assurance	1
equal	1
to	1
her	1
own.	1
He	1
knew	1
how	1
to	1
bring	1
his	1
charge	1
home	1
to	1
her.	1
He	1
produced	1
a	1
note	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
handwriting,	1
the	1
purport	1
of	1
which	1
was	1
to	1
request	1
her	1
cousin's	1
acceptance	1
of	1
"some	1
DELICATE	1
COLD	1
TURKEY,"	1
and	1
to	1
beg	1
she	1
would	1
send	1
her,	1
by	1
the	1
return	1
of	1
the	1
bearer,	1
a	1
little	1
of	1
her	1
cherry-brandy.	1
Mrs.	1
Churchill	1
coolly	1
wrote	1
upon	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
the	1
note	1
her	1
cook's	1
discharge,	1
and	1
informed	1
Felix	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
further	1
occasion	1
for	1
his	1
services,	1
but,	1
upon	1
his	1
pleading	1
with	1
many	1
tears,	1
which	1
Franklin	1
did	1
not	1
call	1
CROCODILE	1
TEARS,	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
young,	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
under	1
the	1
dominion	1
of	1
his	1
aunt,	1
he	1
touched	1
Mrs.	1
Pomfret's	1
compassion,	1
and	1
she	1
obtained	1
for	1
him	1
permission	1
to	1
stay	1
till	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
month,	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
yet	1
a	1
chance	1
of	1
redeeming	1
his	1
character.	1
Mrs.	1
Pomfret	1
now	1
seeing	1
how	1
far	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
imposed	1
upon,	1
resolved,	1
for	1
the	1
future,	1
to	1
be	1
more	1
upon	1
her	1
guard	1
with	1
Felix,	1
and	1
felt	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
treated	1
Franklin	1
with	1
great	1
injustice,	1
when	1
she	1
accused	1
him	1
of	1
malpractices	1
about	1
the	1
sirloin	1
of	1
beef.	1
Good	1
people,	1
when	1
they	1
are	1
made	1
sensible	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
treated	1
anyone	1
with	1
injustice,	1
are	1
impatient	1
to	1
have	1
an	1
opportunity	1
to	1
rectify	1
their	1
mistake;	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Pomfret	1
was	1
now	1
prepared	1
to	1
see	1
everything	1
which	1
Franklin	1
did	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
favourable	1
point	1
of	1
view;	1
especially	1
as	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
she	1
discovered	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
he	1
who	1
every	1
morning	1
boiled	1
the	1
water	1
for	1
her	1
tea,	1
and	1
buttered	1
her	1
toast--services	1
for	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
always	1
thought	1
she	1
was	1
indebted	1
to	1
Felix.	1
Besides,	1
she	1
had	1
rated	1
Felix's	1
abilities	1
very	1
highly,	1
because	1
he	1
made	1
up	1
her	1
weekly	1
accounts	1
for	1
her;	1
but	1
unluckily	1
once,	1
when	1
Franklin	1
was	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way,	1
and	1
she	1
brought	1
a	1
bill	1
in	1
a	1
hurry	1
to	1
her	1
favourite	1
to	1
cast	1
up,	1
she	1
discovered	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
cast	1
up	1
pounds,	1
shillings	1
and	1
pence,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
confess	1
that	1
she	1
must	1
wait	1
till	1
Franklin	1
came	1
home.	1
But,	1
passing	1
over	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
small	1
incidents	1
which	1
gradually	1
unfolded	1
the	1
character	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
boys,	1
we	1
must	1
proceed	1
to	1
a	1
more	1
serious	1
affair.	1
Corkscrew	1
frequently,	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
finished	1
taking	1
away	1
supper,	1
and	1
after	1
the	1
housekeeper	1
was	1
gone	1
to	1
bed,	1
sallied	1
forth	1
to	1
a	1
neighbouring	1
alehouse	1
to	1
drink	1
with	1
his	1
friends.	1
The	1
alehouse	1
was	1
kept	1
by	1
that	1
cousin	1
of	1
Felix's,	1
who	1
was	1
so	1
fond	1
of	1
"DELICATE	1
cold	1
turkey,"	1
and	1
who	1
had	1
such	1
choice	1
cherry-brandy.	1
Corkscrew	1
kept	1
the	1
key	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
door,	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
return	1
home	1
whenever	1
he	1
thought	1
proper;	1
and,	1
if	1
he	1
should	1
by	1
accident	1
be	1
called	1
for	1
by	1
his	1
mistress	1
after	1
supper,	1
Felix	1
knew	1
where	1
to	1
find	1
him,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
scruple	1
to	1
make	1
any	1
of	1
those	1
excuses	1
which	1
poor	1
Franklin	1
had	1
too	1
much	1
integrity	1
to	1
use.	1
All	1
these	1
precautions	1
taken,	1
the	1
butler	1
was	1
at	1
liberty	1
to	1
indulge	1
his	1
favourite	1
passion,	1
which	1
so	1
increased	1
with	1
indulgence,	1
that	1
his	1
wages	1
were	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
sufficient	1
to	1
support	1
him	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
of	1
life.	1
Every	1
day	1
he	1
felt	1
less	1
resolution	1
to	1
break	1
through	1
his	1
bad	1
habits;	1
for	1
every	1
day	1
drinking	1
became	1
more	1
necessary	1
to	1
him.	1
His	1
health	1
was	1
ruined.	1
With	1
a	1
red,	1
pimpled,	1
bloated	1
face,	1
emaciated	1
legs,	1
and	1
a	1
swelled,	1
diseased	1
body,	1
he	1
appeared	1
the	1
victim	1
of	1
intoxication.	1
In	1
the	1
morning,	1
when	1
he	1
got	1
up,	1
his	1
hands	1
trembled,	1
his	1
spirits	1
flagged,	1
he	1
could	1
do	1
nothing	1
until	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
a	1
dram--an	1
operation	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
repeat	1
several	1
times	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
the	1
day,	1
as	1
all	1
those	1
wretched	1
people	1
MUST	1
who	1
once	1
acquire	1
this	1
habit.	1
He	1
had	1
run	1
up	1
a	1
long	1
bill	1
at	1
the	1
alehouse	1
which	1
he	1
frequented;	1
and	1
the	1
landlord,	1
who	1
grew	1
urgent	1
for	1
his	1
money,	1
refused	1
to	1
give	1
further	1
credit.	1
One	1
night,	1
when	1
Corkscrew	1
had	1
drunk	1
enough	1
only	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
fretful,	1
he	1
leaned	1
with	1
his	1
elbow	1
surlily	1
upon	1
the	1
table,	1
began	1
to	1
quarrel	1
with	1
the	1
landlord,	1
and	1
swore	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
of	1
late	1
treated	1
him	1
like	1
a	1
gentleman.	1
To	1
which	1
the	1
landlord	1
coolly	1
replied,	1
"That	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
paid	1
like	1
a	1
gentleman,	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
treated	1
like	1
one,	1
and	1
that	1
was	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
anyone	1
could	1
expect,	1
or,	1
at	1
any	1
rate,	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
anyone	1
would	1
meet	1
with	1
in	1
this	1
world."	1
For	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
this	1
assertion	1
he	1
appealed,	1
laughing,	1
to	1
a	1
party	1
of	1
men	1
who	1
were	1
drinking	1
in	1
the	1
room.	1
The	1
men,	1
however,	1
took	1
part	1
with	1
Corkscrew,	1
and,	1
drawing	1
him	1
over	1
to	1
their	1
table,	1
made	1
him	1
sit	1
down	1
with	1
them.	1
They	1
were	1
in	1
high	1
good-humour,	1
and	1
the	1
butler	1
soon	1
grew	1
so	1
intimate	1
with	1
them,	1
that,	1
in	1
the	1
openness	1
of	1
his	1
heart,	1
he	1
soon	1
communicated	1
to	1
them,	1
not	1
only	1
all	1
his	1
own	1
affairs,	1
but	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
knew,	1
and	1
more	1
than	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
knew,	1
of	1
his	1
mistress'.	1
His	1
new	1
friends	1
were	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
uninterested	1
by	1
his	1
conversation,	1
and	1
encouraged	1
him	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
possible	1
to	1
talk;	1
for	1
they	1
had	1
secret	1
views,	1
which	1
the	1
butler	1
was	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
sufficiently	1
sober	1
to	1
discover.	1
Mrs.	1
Churchill	1
had	1
some	1
fine	1
old	1
family	1
plate;	1
and	1
these	1
men	1
belonged	1
to	1
a	1
gang	1
of	1
housebreakers.	1
Before	1
they	1
parted	1
with	1
Corkscrew,	1
they	1
engaged	1
him	1
to	1
meet	1
them	1
again	1
the	1
next	1
night;	1
their	1
intimacy	1
was	1
still	1
more	1
closely	1
cemented.	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
actually	1
offered	1
to	1
lend	1
Corkscrew	1
three	1
guineas	1
towards	1
the	1
payment	1
of	1
his	1
debt,	1
and	1
hinted	1
that,	1
if	1
he	1
thought	1
proper,	1
he	1
could	1
easily	1
get	1
the	1
whole	1
cleared	1
off.	1
Upon	1
this	1
hint,	1
Corkscrew	1
became	1
all	1
attention,	1
till,	1
after	1
some	1
hesitation	1
on	1
their	1
part,	1
and	1
repeated	1
promises	1
of	1
secrecy	1
on	1
his,	1
they	1
at	1
length	1
disclosed	1
their	1
plans	1
to	1
him.	1
They	1
gave	1
him	1
to	1
understand,	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
would	1
assist	1
in	1
letting	1
them	1
into	1
his	1
mistress'	1
house,	1
they	1
would	1
let	1
him	1
have	1
an	1
ample	1
share	1
in	1
the	1
booty.	1
The	1
butler,	1
who	1
had	1
the	1
reputation	1
of	1
being	1
an	1
honest	1
man,	1
and	1
indeed	1
whose	1
integrity	1
had	1
hitherto	1
been	1
proof	1
against	1
everything	1
but	1
his	1
mistress'	1
port,	1
turned	1
pale,	1
and	1
trembled	1
at	1
this	1
proposal;	1
drank	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
bumpers	1
to	1
drown	1
thought;	1
and	1
promised	1
to	1
give	1
an	1
answer	1
the	1
next	1
day.	1
He	1
went	1
home	1
more	1
than	1
half-intoxicated.	1
His	1
mind	1
was	1
so	1
full	1
of	1
what	1
had	1
passed,	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
bragging	1
to	1
Felix,	1
whom	1
he	1
found	1
awake	1
at	1
his	1
return,	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
have	1
his	1
bill	1
paid	1
off	1
at	1
the	1
alehouse	1
whenever	1
he	1
pleased;	1
dropping,	1
besides,	1
some	1
hints,	1
which	1
were	1
not	1
lost	1
upon	1
Felix.	1
In	1
the	1
morning	1
Felix	1
reminded	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
said;	1
and	1
Corkscrew,	1
alarmed,	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
evade	1
his	1
questions,	1
by	1
saying	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
his	1
senses	1
when	1
he	1
talked	1
in	1
that	1
manner.	1
Nothing,	1
however,	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
urge	1
made	1
any	1
impression	1
upon	1
Felix,	1
whose	1
recollection	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
was	1
perfectly	1
distinct,	1
and	1
who	1
had	1
too	1
much	1
cunning	1
himself,	1
and	1
too	1
little	1
confidence	1
in	1
his	1
companion,	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
dupe	1
of	1
his	1
dissimulation.	1
The	1
butler	1
knew	1
not	1
what	1
to	1
do	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
Felix	1
was	1
absolutely	1
determined	1
either	1
to	1
betray	1
their	1
scheme,	1
or	1
to	1
become	1
a	1
sharer	1
in	1
the	1
booty.	1
The	1
next	1
night	1
came,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
now	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
final	1
decision;	1
either	1
to	1
determine	1
on	1
breaking	1
off	1
entirely	1
with	1
his	1
new	1
acquaintances,	1
or	1
taking	1
Felix	1
with	1
him	1
to	1
join	1
in	1
the	1
plot.	1
His	1
debt,	1
his	1
love	1
of	1
drinking,	1
the	1
impossibility	1
of	1
indulging	1
it	1
without	1
a	1
fresh	1
supply	1
of	1
money,	1
all	1
came	1
into	1
his	1
mind	1
at	1
once,	1
and	1
conquered	1
his	1
remaining	1
scruples.	1
It	1
is	1
said	1
by	1
those	1
whose	1
fatal	1
experience	1
gives	1
them	1
a	1
right	1
to	1
be	1
believed,	1
that	1
a	1
drunkard	1
will	1
sacrifice	1
anything,	1
everything,	1
sooner	1
than	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
habitual	1
intoxication.	1
How	1
much	1
easier	1
is	1
it	1
never	1
to	1
begin	1
a	1
bad	1
custom	1
than	1
to	1
break	1
through	1
it	1
when	1
once	1
formed!	1
The	1
hour	1
of	1
rendezvous	1
came,	1
and	1
Corkscrew	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
alehouse,	1
where	1
he	1
found	1
the	1
housebreakers	1
waiting	1
for	1
him,	1
and	1
a	1
glass	1
of	1
brandy	1
ready	1
poured	1
out.	1
He	1
sighed--drank--hesitated--drank	1
again--heard	1
the	1
landlord	1
talk	1
of	1
his	1
bill,	1
saw	1
the	1
money	1
produced	1
which	1
would	1
pay	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
moment--	1
drank	1
again--cursed	1
himself,	1
and,	1
giving	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
the	1
villain	1
who	1
was	1
whispering	1
in	1
his	1
ear,	1
swore	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
it,	1
and	1
must	1
do	1
as	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
him.	1
They	1
required	1
of	1
him	1
to	1
give	1
up	1
the	1
key	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
door,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
get	1
another	1
made	1
by	1
it.	1
He	1
had	1
left	1
it	1
with	1
Felix,	1
and	1
was	1
now	1
obliged	1
to	1
explain	1
the	1
new	1
difficulty	1
which	1
had	1
arisen.	1
Felix	1
knew	1
enough	1
to	1
ruin	1
them,	1
and	1
must	1
therefore	1
be	1
won	1
over.	1
This	1
was	1
no	1
very	1
difficult	1
task;	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
strong	1
desire	1
to	1
have	1
some	1
worked	1
cravats,	1
and	1
the	1
butler	1
knew	1
enough	1
of	1
him	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
this	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
sufficient	1
bribe.	1
The	1
cravats	1
were	1
bought	1
and	1
shown	1
to	1
Felix.	1
He	1
thought	1
them	1
the	1
only	1
things	1
wanting	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
a	1
complete,	1
fine	1
gentleman;	1
and	1
to	1
go	1
without	1
them,	1
especially	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
once	1
seen	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
glass	1
with	1
one	1
tied	1
on	1
in	1
a	1
splendid	1
bow,	1
appeared	1
impossible.	1
Even	1
this	1
paltry	1
temptation,	1
working	1
upon	1
his	1
vanity,	1
at	1
length	1
prevailed	1
with	1
a	1
boy	1
whose	1
integrity	1
had	1
long	1
been	1
corrupted	1
by	1
the	1
habits	1
of	1
petty	1
pilfering	1
and	1
daily	1
falsehood.	1
It	1
was	1
agreed	1
that,	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
his	1
mistress	1
sent	1
him	1
out	1
on	1
a	1
message,	1
he	1
should	1
carry	1
the	1
key	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
door	1
to	1
his	1
cousin's,	1
and	1
deliver	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
gang,	1
who	1
were	1
there	1
in	1
waiting	1
for	1
it.	1
Such	1
was	1
the	1
scheme.	1
Felix,	1
the	1
night	1
after	1
all	1
this	1
had	1
been	1
planned,	1
went	1
to	1
bed,	1
and	1
fell	1
fast	1
asleep;	1
but	1
the	1
butler,	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
stifled	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
conscience,	1
felt,	1
in	1
the	1
silence	1
of	1
the	1
night,	1
so	1
insupportably	1
miserable,	1
that,	1
instead	1
of	1
going	1
to	1
rest,	1
he	1
stole	1
softly	1
into	1
the	1
pantry	1
for	1
a	1
bottle	1
of	1
his	1
mistress'	1
wine,	1
and	1
there	1
drinking	1
glass	1
after	1
glass,	1
he	1
stayed	1
till	1
he	1
became	1
so	1
far	1
intoxicated,	1
that,	1
though	1
he	1
contrived	1
to	1
find	1
his	1
way	1
back	1
to	1
bed,	1
he	1
could	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
undress	1
himself.	1
Without	1
any	1
power	1
of	1
recollection,	1
he	1
flung	1
himself	1
upon	1
the	1
bed,	1
leaving	1
his	1
candle	1
half	1
hanging	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
candlestick	1
beside	1
him.	1
Franklin	1
slept	1
in	1
the	1
next	1
room	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
presently	1
awaking,	1
thought	1
he	1
perceived	1
a	1
strong	1
smell	1
of	1
something	1
burning.	1
He	1
jumped	1
up,	1
and	1
seeing	1
a	1
light	1
under	1
the	1
butler's	1
door,	1
gently	1
opened	1
it,	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
astonishment,	1
beheld	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
bed	1
curtains	1
in	1
flames.	1
He	1
immediately	1
ran	1
to	1
the	1
butler,	1
and	1
pulled	1
him	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
force,	1
to	1
rouse	1
him	1
from	1
his	1
lethargy.	1
He	1
came	1
to	1
his	1
senses	1
at	1
length,	1
but	1
was	1
so	1
terrified,	1
and	1
so	1
helpless,	1
that,	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
for	1
Franklin,	1
the	1
whole	1
house	1
would	1
soon	1
inevitably	1
have	1
been	1
on	1
fire.	1
Felix,	1
trembling	1
and	1
cowardly,	1
knew	1
not	1
what	1
to	1
do;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
curious	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
obeying	1
Franklin,	1
whose	1
turn	1
it	1
now	1
was	1
to	1
command.	1
Franklin	1
ran	1
upstairs	1
to	1
awaken	1
Mrs.	1
Pomfret,	1
whose	1
terror	1
of	1
fire	1
was	1
so	1
great	1
that	1
she	1
came	1
from	1
her	1
room	1
almost	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
senses,	1
whilst	1
he,	1
with	1
the	1
greatest	1
presence	1
of	1
mind,	1
recollected	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
two	1
large	1
tubs	1
of	1
water,	1
which	1
the	1
maids	1
had	1
prepared	1
the	1
night	1
before	1
for	1
their	1
washing,	1
and	1
seizing	1
the	1
wet	1
linen	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
left	1
to	1
soak,	1
he	1
threw	1
them	1
upon	1
the	1
flames.	1
He	1
exerted	1
himself	1
with	1
so	1
much	1
good	1
sense,	1
that	1
the	1
fire	1
was	1
presently	1
extinguished.	1
Everything	1
was	1
now	1
once	1
more	1
safe	1
and	1
quiet.	1
Mrs.	1
Pomfret,	1
recovering	1
from	1
her	1
fright,	1
postponed	1
all	1
inquiries	1
till	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
rejoiced	1
that	1
her	1
mistress	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
awakened,	1
whilst	1
Corkscrew	1
flattered	1
himself	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
conceal	1
the	1
true	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
accident.	1
"Don't	1
you	1
tell	1
Mrs.	1
Pomfret	1
where	1
you	1
found	1
the	1
candle	1
when	1
you	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
room,"	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
Franklin.	1
"If	1
she	1
asks	1
me,	1
you	1
know	1
I	1
must	1
tell	1
the	1
truth,"	1
replied	1
he.	1
"Must!"	1
repeated	1
Felix,	1
sneeringly;	1
"what,	1
you	1
MUST	1
be	1
a	1
tell-tale!"	1
"No,	1
I	1
never	1
told	1
any	1
tales	1
of	1
anybody,	1
and	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
very	1
sorry	1
to	1
get	1
anyone	1
into	1
a	1
scrape;	1
but	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
tell	1
a	1
lie,	1
either	1
for	1
myself	1
or	1
anybody	1
else,	1
let	1
you	1
call	1
me	1
what	1
names	1
you	1
will."	1
"But	1
if	1
I	1
were	1
to	1
give	1
you	1
something	1
that	1
you	1
would	1
like,"	1
said	1
Corkscrew--"something	1
that	1
I	1
know	1
you	1
would	1
like!"	1
repeated	1
Felix.	1
"Nothing	1
you	1
can	1
give	1
me	1
will	1
do,"	1
answered	1
Franklin,	1
steadily,	1
"so	1
it	1
is	1
useless	1
to	1
say	1
any	1
more	1
about	1
it--I	1
hope	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
questioned."	1
In	1
this	1
hope	1
he	1
was	1
mistaken;	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
thing	1
Mrs.	1
Pomfret	1
did	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
was	1
to	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
to	1
examine	1
and	1
deplore	1
the	1
burnt	1
curtains,	1
whilst	1
Corkscrew	1
stood	1
by,	1
endeavouring	1
to	1
exculpate	1
himself	1
by	1
all	1
the	1
excuses	1
he	1
could	1
invent.	1
Mrs.	1
Pomfret,	1
however,	1
though	1
sometimes	1
blinded	1
by	1
her	1
prejudices,	1
was	1
no	1
fool;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
absolutely	1
impossible	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
believe	1
that	1
a	1
candle,	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
left	1
on	1
the	1
hearth,	1
where	1
Corkscrew	1
protested	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
it,	1
could	1
have	1
set	1
curtains	1
on	1
fire	1
which	1
were	1
at	1
least	1
six	1
feet	1
distant.	1
Turning	1
short	1
round	1
to	1
Franklin,	1
she	1
desired	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
show	1
her	1
where	1
he	1
found	1
the	1
candle	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
room.	1
He	1
took	1
up	1
the	1
candlestick;	1
but	1
the	1
moment	1
the	1
housekeeper	1
cast	1
her	1
eye	1
upon	1
it,	1
she	1
snatched	1
it	1
from	1
his	1
hands;	1
"How	1
did	1
this	1
candlestick	1
come	1
here?	1
This	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
candlestick	1
you	1
found	1
here	1
last	1
night,"	1
cried	1
she.	1
"Yes,	1
indeed	1
it	1
was,"	1
answered	1
Franklin.	1
"That	1
is	1
impossible,"	1
retorted	1
she,	1
vehemently,	1
"for	1
I	1
left	1
this	1
candlestick	1
with	1
my	1
own	1
hands	1
last	1
night,	1
in	1
the	1
hall,	1
the	1
last	1
thing	1
I	1
did,	1
after	1
you,"	1
said	1
she,	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
butler,	1
"was	1
gone	1
to	1
bed--I'm	1
sure	1
of	1
it--Nay,	1
don't	1
you	1
recollect	1
my	1
taking	1
this	1
JAPANNED	1
CANDLESTICK	1
out	1
of	1
your	1
hand,	1
and	1
making	1
you	1
to	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
bed	1
with	1
the	1
brass	1
one,	1
and	1
I	1
bolted	1
the	1
door	1
at	1
the	1
stair-head	1
after	1
you?"	1
This	1
was	1
all	1
very	1
true;	1
but	1
Corkscrew	1
had	1
afterwards	1
gone	1
down	1
from	1
his	1
room	1
by	1
a	1
back	1
staircase,	1
unbolted	1
that	1
door,	1
and,	1
upon	1
his	1
return	1
from	1
the	1
alehouse,	1
had	1
taken	1
the	1
japanned	1
candlestick	1
by	1
mistake	1
upstairs,	1
and	1
had	1
left	1
the	1
brass	1
one	1
in	1
its	1
stead	1
upon	1
the	1
hall	1
table.	1
"Oh,	1
ma'am,"	1
said	1
Felix,	1
"indeed	1
you	1
forget;	1
for	1
Mr.	1
Corkscrew	1
came	1
into	1
my	1
room	1
to	1
desire	1
me	1
to	1
call	1
him	1
betimes	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
I	1
happened	1
to	1
take	1
particular	1
notice,	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
japanned	1
candlestick	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
that	1
was	1
just	1
as	1
I	1
heard	1
you,	1
bolting	1
the	1
door.	1
Indeed,	1
ma'am	1
you	1
forget."	1
"Indeed,	1
sir,"	1
retorted	1
Mrs.	1
Pomfret,	1
rising	1
in	1
anger,	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
forget;	1
I'm	1
not	1
come	1
to	1
be	1
SUPPERANNUATED	1
yet,	1
I	1
hope.	1
How	1
do	1
you	1
dare	1
to	1
tell	1
me	1
I	1
forget?"	1
"Oh,	1
ma'am,"	1
cried	1
Felix,	1
"I	1
beg	1
your	1
pardon,	1
I	1
did	1
not--I	1
did	1
not	1
mean	1
to	1
say	1
you	1
forgot,	1
but	1
only	1
I	1
thought,	1
perhaps,	1
you	1
might	1
not	1
particularly	1
remember;	1
for	1
if	1
you	1
please	1
to	1
recollect--"	1
"I	1
won't	1
please	1
to	1
recollect	1
just	1
whatever	1
you	1
please,	1
sir!	1
Hold	1
your	1
tongue;	1
why	1
should	1
you	1
poke	1
yourself	1
into	1
this	1
scrape;	1
what	1
have	1
you	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
it,	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
glad	1
to	1
know?"	1
"Nothing	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
oh	1
nothing	1
in	1
the	1
world;	1
I'm	1
sure	1
I	1
beg	1
your	1
pardon,	1
ma'am,"	1
answered	1
Felix,	1
in	1
a	1
soft	1
tone;	1
and,	1
sneaking	1
off,	1
left	1
his	1
friend	1
Corkscrew	1
to	1
fight	1
his	1
own	1
battle,	1
secretly	1
resolving	1
to	1
desert	1
in	1
good	1
time,	1
if	1
he	1
saw	1
any	1
danger	1
of	1
the	1
alehouse	1
transactions	1
coming	1
to	1
light.	1
Corkscrew	1
could	1
make	1
but	1
very	1
blundering	1
excuses	1
for	1
himself	1
and,	1
conscious	1
of	1
guilt,	1
he	1
turned	1
pale,	1
and	1
appeared	1
so	1
much	1
more	1
terrified	1
than	1
butlers	1
usually	1
appear	1
when	1
detected	1
in	1
a	1
lie,	1
that	1
Mrs.	1
Pomfret	1
resolved,	1
as	1
she	1
said,	1
to	1
sift	1
the	1
matter	1
to	1
the	1
bottom.	1
Impatiently	1
did	1
she	1
wait	1
till	1
the	1
clock	1
struck	1
nine,	1
and	1
her	1
mistress'	1
bell	1
rang,	1
the	1
signal	1
for	1
her	1
attendance	1
at	1
her	1
levee.	1
"How	1
do	1
you	1
find	1
yourself	1
this	1
morning,	1
ma'am?"	1
said	1
she,	1
undrawing	1
the	1
curtains.	1
"Very	1
sleepy,	1
indeed,"	1
answered	1
her	1
mistress	1
in	1
a	1
drowsy	1
voice;	1
"I	1
think	1
I	1
must	1
sleep	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
longer--shut	1
the	1
curtains."	1
"As	1
you	1
please,	1
ma'am;	1
but	1
I	1
suppose	1
I	1
had	1
better	1
open	1
a	1
little	1
of	1
the	1
window	1
shutter,	1
for	1
it's	1
past	1
nine."	1
"But	1
just	1
struck."	1
"Oh	1
dear,	1
ma'am,	1
it	1
struck	1
before	1
I	1
came	1
upstairs,	1
and	1
you	1
know	1
we	1
are	1
twenty	1
minutes	1
slow--Lord	1
bless	1
us!"	1
exclaimed	1
Mrs.	1
Pomfret,	1
as	1
she	1
let	1
fall	1
the	1
bar	1
of	1
the	1
window,	1
which	1
roused	1
her	1
mistress.	1
"I'm	1
sure	1
I	1
beg	1
your	1
pardon	1
a	1
thousand	1
times--it's	1
only	1
the	1
bar--because	1
I	1
had	1
this	1
great	1
key	1
in	1
my	1
hand."	1
"Put	1
down	1
the	1
key,	1
then,	1
or	1
you'll	1
knock	1
something	1
else	1
down;	1
and	1
you	1
may	1
open	1
the	1
shutters	1
now;	1
for	1
I'm	1
quite	1
awake."	1
"Dear	1
me!	1
I'm	1
so	1
sorry	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
disturbing	1
you,"	1
cried	1
Mrs.	1
Pomfret,	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
throwing	1
the	1
shutters	1
wide	1
open;	1
"but,	1
to	1
be	1
sure,	1
ma'am,	1
I	1
have	1
something	1
to	1
tell	1
you,	1
which	1
won't	1
let	1
you	1
sleep	1
again	1
in	1
a	1
hurry.	1
I	1
brought	1
up	1
this	1
here	1
key	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
door	1
for	1
reasons	1
of	1
my	1
own,	1
which	1
I'm	1
sure	1
you'll	1
approve	1
of;	1
but	1
I'm	1
not	1
come	1
to	1
that	1
part	1
of	1
my	1
story	1
yet.	1
I	1
hope	1
you	1
were	1
not	1
disturbed	1
by	1
the	1
noise	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
last	1
night,	1
ma'am."	1
"I	1
heard	1
no	1
noise."	1
"I	1
am	1
surprised	1
at	1
that,	1
though,"	1
continued	1
Mrs.	1
Pomfret,	1
and	1
proceeded	1
to	1
give	1
a	1
most	1
ample	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
fire,	1
of	1
her	1
fears,	1
and	1
her	1
suspicions.	1
"To	1
be	1
sure,	1
ma'am,	1
what	1
I	1
say	1
IS,	1
that,	1
without	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
prophecy,	1
one	1
can	1
nowadays	1
account	1
for	1
what	1
has	1
passed.	1
I'm	1
quite	1
clear	1
in	1
my	1
own	1
judgment,	1
that	1
Mr.	1
Corkscrew	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
out	1
last	1
night	1
after	1
I	1
went	1
to	1
bed;	1
for,	1
besides	1
the	1
japanned	1
candlestick,	1
which	1
of	1
itself	1
I'm	1
sure	1
is	1
strong	1
enough	1
to	1
hang	1
a	1
man,	1
there's	1
another	1
circumstance,	1
ma'am,	1
that	1
certifies	1
it	1
to	1
me--though	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
mentioned	1
it,	1
ma'am,	1
to	1
no	1
one	1
yet,"	1
lowering	1
her	1
voice--"Franklin,	1
when	1
I	1
questioned	1
him,	1
told	1
me,	1
that	1
he	1
left	1
the	1
lantern	1
in	1
the	1
outside	1
porch	1
in	1
the	1
court	1
last	1
night,	1
and	1
this	1
morning	1
it	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
kitchen	1
table.	1
Now,	1
ma'am,	1
that	1
lantern	1
could	1
not	1
come	1
without	1
hands;	1
and	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
forget	1
about	1
that,	1
you	1
know;	1
for	1
Franklin	1
says,	1
he's	1
sure	1
he	1
left	1
the	1
lantern	1
out."	1
"And	1
do	1
you	1
believe	1
HIM?"	1
inquired	1
her	1
mistress.	1
"To	1
be	1
sure,	1
ma'am--how	1
can	1
I	1
help	1
believing	1
him?	1
I	1
never	1
found	1
him	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
symptom	1
of	1
a	1
lie	1
since	1
ever	1
he	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
house;	1
so	1
one	1
can't	1
help	1
believing	1
in	1
him,	1
like	1
him	1
or	1
not."	1
"Without	1
meaning	1
to	1
tell	1
a	1
falsehood,	1
however,"	1
said	1
the	1
lady,	1
"he	1
might	1
make	1
a	1
mistake."	1
"No,	1
ma'am,	1
he	1
never	1
makes	1
mistakes;	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
his	1
way	1
to	1
go	1
gossiping	1
and	1
tattling;	1
he	1
never	1
tells	1
anything	1
till	1
he's	1
asked,	1
and	1
then	1
it's	1
fit	1
he	1
should.	1
About	1
the	1
sirloin	1
of	1
beef,	1
and	1
all,	1
he	1
was	1
right	1
in	1
the	1
end,	1
I	1
found,	1
to	1
do	1
him	1
justice;	1
and	1
I'm	1
sure	1
he's	1
right	1
now	1
about	1
the	1
lantern--he's	1
ALWAY'S	1
RIGHT"	1
Mrs.	1
Churchill	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
smiling.	1
"If	1
you	1
had	1
seen	1
him,	1
ma'am,	1
last	1
night	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
fire--I'm	1
sure	1
we	1
may	1
thank	1
him	1
that	1
we	1
were	1
not	1
burned	1
alive	1
in	1
our	1
beds--and	1
I	1
shall	1
never	1
forget	1
his	1
coming	1
to	1
call	1
me.	1
Poor	1
fellow!	1
he	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
always	1
scolding	1
and	1
scolding,	1
enough	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
hate	1
me.	1
But	1
he's	1
too	1
good	1
to	1
hate	1
anybody;	1
and	1
I'll	1
be	1
bound	1
I'll	1
make	1
it	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
now."	1
"Take	1
care	1
that	1
you	1
don't	1
go	1
from	1
one	1
extreme	1
into	1
another,	1
Pomfret;	1
don't	1
spoil	1
the	1
boy."	1
"No,	1
ma'am,	1
there's	1
no	1
danger	1
of	1
that;	1
but	1
I'm	1
sure	1
if	1
you	1
had	1
seen	1
him	1
last	1
night	1
yourself,	1
you	1
would	1
think	1
he	1
deserved	1
to	1
be	1
rewarded."	1
"And	1
so	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
rewarded,"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Churchill;	1
"but	1
I	1
will	1
try	1
him	1
more	1
fully	1
yet."	1
"There's	1
no	1
occasion,	1
I	1
think,	1
for	1
trying	1
him	1
any	1
more,	1
ma'am,"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Pomfret,	1
who	1
was	1
as	1
violent	1
in	1
her	1
likings	1
as	1
in	1
her	1
dislikes.	1
"Pray	1
desire,"	1
continued	1
her	1
mistress,	1
"that	1
he	1
will	1
bring	1
up	1
breakfast	1
this	1
morning;	1
and	1
leave	1
the	1
key	1
of	1
the	1
house-door,	1
Pomfret,	1
with	1
me."	1
When	1
Franklin	1
brought	1
the	1
urn	1
into	1
the	1
breakfast-parlour,	1
his	1
mistress	1
was	1
standing	1
by	1
the	1
fire	1
with	1
the	1
key	1
in	1
her	1
hand.	1
She	1
spoke	1
to	1
him	1
of	1
his	1
last	1
night's	1
exertions	1
in	1
terms	1
of	1
much	1
approbation.	1
"How	1
long	1
have	1
you	1
lived	1
with	1
me?"	1
said	1
she,	1
pausing;	1
"three	1
weeks,	1
I	1
think?"	1
"Three	1
weeks	1
and	1
four	1
days,	1
madam."	1
"That	1
is	1
but	1
a	1
short	1
time;	1
yet	1
you	1
have	1
conducted	1
yourself	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
make	1
me	1
think	1
I	1
may	1
depend	1
upon	1
you.	1
You	1
know	1
this	1
key?"	1
"I	1
believe,	1
madam,	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
key	1
of	1
the	1
house-door."	1
"It	1
is;	1
I	1
shall	1
trust	1
it	1
in	1
your	1
care.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
trust	1
for	1
so	1
young	1
a	1
person	1
as	1
you	1
are."	1
Franklin	1
stood	1
silent,	1
with	1
a	1
firm	1
but	1
modest	1
look.	1
"If	1
you	1
take	1
the	1
charge	1
of	1
this	1
key,"	1
continued	1
his	1
mistress,	1
"remember	1
it	1
is	1
upon	1
condition	1
that	1
you	1
never	1
give	1
it	1
out	1
of	1
your	1
own	1
hands.	1
In	1
the	1
daytime	1
it	1
must	1
not	1
be	1
left	1
in	1
the	1
door.	1
You	1
must	1
not	1
tell	1
anybody	1
where	1
you	1
keep	1
it	1
at	1
night;	1
and	1
the	1
house-door	1
must	1
not	1
be	1
unlocked	1
after	1
eleven	1
o'clock	1
at	1
night,	1
unless	1
by	1
my	1
orders.	1
Will	1
you	1
take	1
charge	1
of	1
the	1
key	1
upon	1
these	1
conditions?"	1
"I	1
will,	1
madam,	1
do	1
anything	1
you	1
order	1
me,"	1
said	1
Franklin,	1
and	1
received	1
the	1
key	1
from	1
her	1
hands.	1
When	1
Mrs.	1
Churchill's	1
orders	1
were	1
made	1
known,	1
they	1
caused	1
many	1
secret	1
marvellings	1
and	1
murmurings.	1
Corkscrew	1
and	1
Felix	1
were	1
disconcerted,	1
and	1
dared	1
not	1
openly	1
avow	1
their	1
discontent;	1
and	1
they	1
treated	1
Franklin	1
with	1
the	1
greatest	1
seeming	1
kindness	1
and	1
cordiality.	1
Everything	1
went	1
on	1
smoothly	1
for	1
three	1
days.	1
The	1
butler	1
never	1
attempted	1
his	1
usual	1
midnight	1
visits	1
to	1
the	1
alehouse,	1
but	1
went	1
to	1
bed	1
in	1
proper	1
time,	1
and	1
paid	1
particular	1
court	1
to	1
Mrs	1
Pomfret,	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
dispel	1
her	1
suspicions.	1
She	1
had	1
never	1
had	1
any	1
idea	1
of	1
the	1
real	1
fact,	1
that	1
he	1
and	1
Felix	1
were	1
joined	1
in	1
a	1
plot	1
with	1
house-breakers	1
to	1
rob	1
the	1
house,	1
but	1
thought	1
he	1
only	1
went	1
out	1
at	1
irregular	1
hours	1
to	1
indulge	1
himself	1
in	1
his	1
passion	1
for	1
drinking.	1
Thus	1
stood	1
affairs	1
the	1
night	1
before	1
Mrs.	1
Churchill's	1
birthday.	1
Corkscrew,	1
by	1
the	1
housekeeper's	1
means,	1
ventured	1
to	1
present	1
a	1
petition	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
play	1
the	1
next	1
day,	1
and	1
his	1
request	1
was	1
granted.	1
Franklin	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
kitchen	1
just	1
when	1
all	1
the	1
servants	1
had	1
gathered	1
round	1
the	1
butler,	1
who,	1
with	1
great	1
importance,	1
was	1
reading	1
aloud	1
the	1
play-	1
bill.	1
Everybody	1
present	1
soon	1
began	1
to	1
speak	1
at	1
once,	1
and	1
with	1
great	1
enthusiasm	1
talked	1
of	1
the	1
playhouse,	1
the	1
actors,	1
and	1
actresses;	1
and	1
then	1
Felix,	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
pause,	1
turned	1
to	1
Franklin,	1
and	1
said,	1
"Lord,	1
you	1
know	1
nothing	1
of	1
all	1
this!	1
YOU	1
never	1
went	1
to	1
a	1
play,	1
did	1
you?"	1
"Never,"	1
said	1
Franklin,	1
and	1
felt,	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
why,	1
a	1
little	1
ashamed;	1
and	1
he	1
longed	1
extremely	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
one.	1
"How	1
should	1
you	1
like	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
play	1
with	1
me	1
to-morrow?"	1
said	1
Corkscrew.	1
"Oh,"	1
exclaimed	1
Franklin,	1
"I	1
should	1
like	1
it	1
exceedingly."	1
"And	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
mistress	1
would	1
let	1
you	1
if	1
I	1
asked?"	1
"I	1
think	1
maybe	1
she	1
would,	1
if	1
Mrs.	1
Pomfret	1
asked	1
her."	1
"But	1
then	1
you	1
have	1
no	1
money,	1
have	1
you?"	1
"No,"	1
said	1
Franklin,	1
sighing.	1
"But	1
stay,"	1
said	1
Corkscrew,	1
"what	1
I	1
am	1
thinking	1
of	1
is,	1
that	1
if	1
mistress	1
will	1
let	1
you	1
go,	1
I'll	1
treat	1
you	1
myself,	1
rather	1
than	1
that	1
you	1
should	1
he	1
disappointed."	1
Delight,	1
surprise	1
and	1
gratitude	1
appeared	1
in	1
Franklin's	1
face	1
at	1
these	1
words.	1
Corkscrew	1
rejoiced	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
now,	1
at	1
least,	1
he	1
had	1
found	1
a	1
most	1
powerful	1
temptation.	1
"Well	1
then,	1
I'll	1
go	1
just	1
now	1
and	1
ask	1
her.	1
In	1
the	1
meantime,	1
lend	1
me	1
the	1
key	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
door	1
for	1
a	1
minute	1
or	1
two."	1
"The	1
key!"	1
answered	1
Franklin,	1
starting;	1
"I'm	1
sorry,	1
but	1
I	1
can't	1
do	1
that,	1
for	1
I've	1
promised	1
my	1
mistress	1
never	1
to	1
let	1
it	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
hands."	1
"But	1
how	1
will	1
she	1
know	1
anything	1
of	1
the	1
matter?	1
Run,	1
run,	1
and	1
get	1
it	1
for	1
us."	1
"No,	1
I	1
CANNOT,"	1
replied	1
Franklin,	1
resisting	1
the	1
push	1
which	1
the	1
butler	1
gave	1
his	1
shoulder.	1
"You	1
can't?"	1
cried	1
Corkscrew,	1
changing	1
his	1
tone;	1
"then,	1
sir,	1
I	1
can't	1
take	1
you	1
to	1
the	1
play."	1
"Very	1
well,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
Franklin,	1
sorrowfully,	1
but	1
with	1
steadiness.	1
"Very	1
well,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
Felix,	1
mimicking	1
him,	1
"you	1
need	1
not	1
look	1
so	1
important,	1
nor	1
fancy	1
yourself	1
such	1
a	1
great	1
man,	1
because	1
you're	1
master	1
of	1
a	1
key."	1
"Say	1
no	1
more	1
to	1
him,"	1
interrupted	1
Corkscrew:	1
"let	1
him	1
alone	1
to	1
take	1
his	1
own	1
way.	1
Felix,	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
no	1
objection,	1
I	1
suppose,	1
to	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
play	1
with	1
me?"	1
"Oh,	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
it	1
of	1
all	1
things,	1
if	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
come	1
between	1
anybody	1
else.	1
But	1
come,	1
come!"	1
added	1
the	1
hypocrite,	1
assuming	1
a	1
tone	1
of	1
friendly	1
persuasion,	1
"you	1
won't	1
be	1
such	1
a	1
blockhead,	1
Franklin,	1
as	1
to	1
lose	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
play	1
for	1
nothing;	1
it's	1
only	1
just	1
obstinacy.	1
What	1
harm	1
can	1
it	1
do,	1
to	1
lend	1
Mr.	1
Corkscrew	1
the	1
key	1
for	1
five	1
minutes?	1
he'll	1
give	1
it	1
to	1
you	1
back	1
again	1
safe	1
and	1
sound."	1
"I	1
don't	1
doubt	1
THAT,"	1
answered	1
Franklin.	1
"Then	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
all	1
because	1
you	1
don't	1
wish	1
to	1
oblige	1
Mr.	1
Corkscrew."	1
"No,	1
but	1
I	1
can't	1
oblige	1
him	1
in	1
this;	1
for,	1
as	1
I	1
told	1
you	1
before,	1
my	1
mistress	1
trusted	1
me.	1
I	1
promised	1
never	1
to	1
let	1
the	1
key	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
hands,	1
and	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
me	1
break	1
my	1
trust.	1
Mr.	1
Spencer	1
told	1
me	1
that	1
was	1
worse	1
than	1
ROBBING."	1
At	1
the	1
word	1
ROBBING	1
both	1
Corkscrew	1
and	1
Felix	1
involuntarily	1
cast	1
down	1
their	1
eyes,	1
and	1
turned	1
the	1
conversation	1
immediately,	1
saying,	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
very	1
right;	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
really	1
want	1
the	1
key,	1
and	1
had	1
only	1
asked	1
for	1
it	1
just	1
to	1
try	1
if	1
he	1
would	1
keep	1
his	1
word.	1
"Shake	1
hands,"	1
said	1
Corkscrew,	1
"I	1
am	1
glad	1
to	1
find	1
you	1
out	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
honest	1
fellow!"	1
"I	1
am	1
sorry	1
you	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
me	1
an	1
honest	1
fellow	1
before,	1
Mr.	1
Corkscrew,"	1
said	1
Franklin,	1
giving	1
his	1
hand	1
rather	1
proudly,	1
and	1
he	1
walked	1
away.	1
"We	1
shall	1
make	1
no	1
hand	1
of	1
this	1
prig,"	1
said	1
Corkscrew.	1
"But	1
we'll	1
have	1
the	1
key	1
from	1
him	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
obstinacy,"	1
said	1
Felix;	1
"and	1
let	1
him	1
make	1
his	1
story	1
good	1
as	1
he	1
can	1
afterwards.	1
He	1
shall	1
repent	1
of	1
these	1
airs.	1
To-night	1
I'll	1
watch	1
him,	1
and	1
find	1
out	1
where	1
he	1
hides	1
the	1
key;	1
and	1
when	1
he's	1
asleep	1
we'll	1
get	1
it	1
without	1
thanking	1
him."	1
This	1
plan	1
Felix	1
put	1
into	1
execution.	1
They	1
discovered	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
Franklin	1
kept	1
the	1
key	1
at	1
night,	1
stole	1
it	1
whilst	1
he	1
slept,	1
took	1
off	1
the	1
impression	1
in	1
wax,	1
and	1
carefully	1
replaced	1
it	1
in	1
Franklin's	1
trunk,	1
exactly	1
where	1
they	1
found	1
it.	1
Probably	1
our	1
young	1
readers	1
cannot	1
guess	1
what	1
use	1
they	1
could	1
mean	1
to	1
make	1
of	1
this	1
impression	1
of	1
the	1
key	1
in	1
wax.	1
Knowing	1
how	1
to	1
do	1
mischief	1
is	1
very	1
different	1
from	1
wishing	1
to	1
do	1
it:	1
and	1
the	1
most	1
innocent	1
persons	1
are	1
generally	1
the	1
least	1
ignorant.	1
By	1
means	1
of	1
the	1
impression,	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
thus	1
obtained,	1
Corkscrew	1
and	1
Felix	1
proposed	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
false	1
key	1
made	1
by	1
Picklock,	1
a	1
smith	1
who	1
belonged	1
to	1
their	1
gang	1
of	1
house-breakers;	1
and	1
with	1
this	1
false	1
key	1
knew	1
they	1
could	1
open	1
the	1
door	1
whenever	1
they	1
pleased.	1
Little	1
suspecting	1
what	1
had	1
happened,	1
Franklin,	1
the	1
next	1
morning	1
went	1
to	1
unlock	1
the	1
house	1
door,	1
as	1
usual;	1
but	1
finding	1
the	1
key	1
entangled	1
in	1
the	1
lock,	1
he	1
took	1
it	1
out	1
to	1
examine	1
it,	1
and	1
perceived	1
a	1
lump	1
of	1
wax	1
sticking	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
wards.	1
Struck	1
with	1
this	1
circumstance,	1
it	1
brought	1
to	1
his	1
mind	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
passed	1
the	1
preceding	1
evening,	1
and	1
being	1
sure	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
wax	1
near	1
the	1
key,	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
suspect	1
what	1
had	1
happened;	1
and	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
recollecting	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
once	1
heard	1
Felix	1
say,	1
that	1
"give	1
him	1
but	1
a	1
halfpenny	1
worth	1
of	1
wax,	1
and	1
he	1
could	1
open	1
the	1
strongest	1
lock	1
that	1
ever	1
was	1
made	1
by	1
hands."	1
All	1
these	1
things	1
considered,	1
Franklin	1
resolved	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
key	1
just	1
as	1
it	1
was,	1
with	1
the	1
wax	1
sticking	1
to	1
it,	1
to	1
his	1
mistress.	1
"I	1
was	1
not	1
mistaken	1
when	1
I	1
thought	1
I	1
might	1
trust	1
YOU	1
with	1
this	1
key,"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Churchill,	1
after	1
she	1
had	1
heard	1
his	1
story.	1
"My	1
brother	1
will	1
be	1
here	1
to-day,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
consult	1
him.	1
In	1
the	1
meantime,	1
say	1
nothing	1
of	1
what	1
has	1
passed."	1
Evening	1
came,	1
and	1
after	1
tea	1
Mr.	1
Spencer	1
sent	1
for	1
Franklin	1
upstairs.	1
"So,	1
Mr.	1
Franklin,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"I'm	1
glad	1
to	1
find	1
you	1
are	1
in	1
such	1
high	1
TRUST	1
in	1
this	1
family."	1
Franklin	1
bowed.	1
"But	1
you	1
have	1
lost,	1
I	1
understand,	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
play	1
to-night."	1
"I	1
don't	1
think	1
anything--much,	1
I	1
mean,	1
of	1
that,	1
sir,"	1
answered	1
Franklin,	1
smiling.	1
"Are	1
Corkscrew	1
and	1
Felix	1
GONE	1
to	1
the	1
play?"	1
"Yes;	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
ago,	1
sir."	1
"Then	1
I	1
shall	1
look	1
into	1
his	1
room,	1
and	1
examine	1
the	1
pantry	1
and	1
the	1
plate	1
that	1
is	1
under	1
his	1
care."	1
When	1
Mr.	1
Spencer	1
came	1
to	1
examine	1
the	1
pantry,	1
he	1
found	1
the	1
large	1
salvers	1
and	1
cups	1
in	1
a	1
basket	1
behind	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
things	1
placed	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
easily	1
carried	1
off.	1
Nothing	1
at	1
first	1
appeared	1
in	1
Corkscrew's	1
bedchamber,	1
to	1
strengthen	1
their	1
suspicions,	1
till,	1
just	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
going	1
to	1
leave	1
the	1
room,	1
Mrs.	1
Pomfret	1
exclaimed,	1
"Why,	1
if	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
Mr.	1
Corkscrew's	1
dress	1
coat	1
hanging	1
up	1
there!	1
and	1
if	1
here	1
isn't	1
Felix's	1
fine	1
cravat	1
that	1
he	1
wanted	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
hurry	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
play!	1
Why,	1
sir,	1
they	1
can't	1
be	1
gone	1
to	1
the	1
play.	1
Look	1
at	1
the	1
cravat.	1
Ah!	1
upon	1
my	1
word	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
at	1
the	1
play.	1
No,	1
sir,	1
you	1
may	1
be	1
sure	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
plotting	1
with	1
their	1
barbarous	1
gang	1
at	1
the	1
alehouse;	1
and	1
they'll	1
certainly	1
break	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
to-night.	1
We	1
shall	1
all	1
be	1
murdered	1
in	1
our	1
beds,	1
as	1
sure	1
as	1
I'm	1
a	1
living	1
woman,	1
sir;	1
but	1
if	1
you'll	1
only	1
take	1
my	1
advice--"	1
"Pray,	1
good	1
Mrs.	1
Pomfret,"	1
Mr.	1
Spencer	1
observed,	1
"don't	1
be	1
alarmed."	1
"Nay,	1
sir,	1
but	1
I	1
won't	1
pretend	1
to	1
sleep	1
in	1
the	1
house,	1
if	1
Franklin	1
isn't	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
blunderbuss,	1
and	1
I	1
a	1
BAGGONET."	1
"You	1
shall	1
have	1
both,	1
indeed,	1
Mrs.	1
Pomfret;	1
but	1
don't	1
make	1
such	1
a	1
noise,	1
for	1
everybody	1
will	1
hear	1
you."	1
The	1
love	1
of	1
mystery	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
thing	1
which	1
could	1
have	1
conquered	1
Mrs.	1
Pomfret's	1
love	1
of	1
talking.	1
She	1
was	1
silent,	1
and	1
contented	1
herself	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
evening	1
with	1
making	1
signs,	1
looking	1
ominous,	1
and	1
stalking	1
about	1
the	1
house	1
like	1
one	1
possessed	1
with	1
a	1
secret.	1
Escaped	1
from	1
Mrs.	1
Pomfret's	1
fears	1
and	1
advice,	1
Mr.	1
Spencer	1
went	1
to	1
a	1
shop	1
within	1
a	1
few	1
doors	1
of	1
the	1
alehouse,	1
which	1
he	1
heard	1
Corkscrew	1
frequented,	1
and	1
sent	1
to	1
beg	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
the	1
landlord.	1
He	1
came;	1
and,	1
when	1
Mr.	1
Spencer	1
questioned	1
him,	1
confessed	1
that	1
Corkscrew	1
and	1
Felix	1
were	1
actually	1
drinking	1
in	1
his	1
house	1
with	1
two	1
men	1
of	1
suspicious	1
appearance;	1
that,	1
as	1
he	1
passed	1
through	1
the	1
passage,	1
he	1
heard	1
them	1
disputing	1
about	1
a	1
key;	1
and	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
said,	1
"Since	1
we've	1
got	1
the	1
key,	1
we'll	1
go	1
about	1
it	1
to-night."	1
This	1
was	1
sufficient	1
information.	1
Mr.	1
Spencer,	1
lest	1
the	1
landlord	1
should	1
give	1
them	1
information	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
going	1
forwards,	1
took	1
him	1
along	1
with	1
him	1
to	1
Bow	1
Street.	1
A	1
constable	1
and	1
proper	1
assistance	1
was	1
sent	1
to	1
Mrs.	1
Churchill's.	1
They	1
stationed	1
themselves	1
in	1
a	1
back	1
parlour	1
which	1
opened	1
on	1
a	1
passage	1
leading	1
to	1
the	1
butler's	1
pantry,	1
where	1
the	1
plate	1
was	1
kept.	1
A	1
little	1
after	1
midnight	1
they	1
heard	1
the	1
hall	1
door	1
open.	1
Corkscrew	1
and	1
his	1
accomplices	1
went	1
directly	1
to	1
the	1
pantry;	1
and	1
there	1
Mr.	1
Spencer	1
and	1
the	1
constable	1
immediately	1
secured	1
them,	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
carrying	1
off	1
their	1
booty.	1
Mrs	1
Churchill	1
and	1
Pomfret	1
had	1
spent	1
the	1
night	1
at	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
an	1
acquaintance	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
street.	1
"Well,	1
ma'am,"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Pomfret,	1
who	1
had	1
heard	1
all	1
the	1
news	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
"the	1
villains	1
are	1
all	1
safe,	1
thank	1
God.	1
I	1
was	1
afraid	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
window	1
this	1
morning;	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
my	1
luck	1
to	1
see	1
them	1
all	1
go	1
by	1
to	1
gaol.	1
They	1
looked	1
so	1
shocking!	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
I	1
never	1
shall	1
forget	1
Felix's	1
look	1
to	1
my	1
dying	1
day!	1
But	1
poor	1
Franklin!	1
ma'am;	1
that	1
boy	1
has	1
the	1
best	1
heart	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
get	1
him	1
to	1
give	1
a	1
second	1
look	1
at	1
them	1
as	1
they	1
passed.	1
Poor	1
fellow!	1
I	1
thought	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
dropped;	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
modest,	1
ma'am,	1
when	1
Mr.	1
Spencer	1
spoke	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
his	1
duty."	1
"And	1
did	1
my	1
brother	1
tell	1
him	1
what	1
reward	1
I	1
intend	1
for	1
him?"	1
"No,	1
ma'am,	1
and	1
I'm	1
sure	1
Franklin	1
thinks	1
no	1
more	1
of	1
REWARD	1
than	1
I	1
do."	1
"I	1
intend,"	1
continued	1
Mrs.	1
Churchill,	1
"to	1
sell	1
some	1
of	1
my	1
old	1
useless	1
plate,	1
and	1
to	1
lay	1
it	1
out	1
in	1
an	1
annuity	1
for	1
Franklin's	1
life."	1
"La,	1
ma'am!"	1
exclaimed	1
Mrs.	1
Pomfret,	1
with	1
unfeigned	1
joy,	1
"I'm	1
sure	1
you	1
are	1
very	1
good;	1
and	1
I'm	1
very	1
glad	1
of	1
it."	1
"And,"	1
continued	1
Mrs.	1
Churchill,	1
"here	1
are	1
some	1
tickets	1
for	1
the	1
play,	1
which	1
I	1
shall	1
beg	1
you,	1
Pomfret,	1
to	1
give	1
him,	1
and	1
to	1
take	1
him	1
with	1
you."	1
"I	1
am	1
very	1
much	1
obliged	1
to	1
you,	1
indeed,	1
ma'am;	1
and	1
I'll	1
go	1
with	1
him	1
with	1
all	1
my	1
heart,	1
and	1
choose	1
such	1
plays	1
as	1
won't	1
do	1
no	1
prejudice	1
to	1
his	1
morality.	1
And,	1
ma'am,"	1
continued	1
Mrs.	1
Pomfret,	1
"the	1
night	1
after	1
the	1
fire	1
I	1
left	1
him	1
my	1
great	1
Bible	1
and	1
my	1
watch,	1
in	1
my	1
will;	1
for	1
I	1
never	1
was	1
more	1
mistaken	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
in	1
any	1
boy	1
in	1
my	1
born	1
days;	1
but	1
he	1
has	1
won	1
me	1
by	1
his	1
own	1
DESERTS,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
from	1
this	1
time	1
forth	1
love	1
all	1
the	1
VILLAINTROPIC	1
folks	1
for	1
his	1
sake."	1
SIMPLE	1
SUSAN.	1
CHAPTER	1
I.	1
Waked	1
as	1
her	1
custom	1
was,	1
before	1
the	1
day,	1
To	1
do	1
the	1
observance	1
due	1
to	1
sprightly	1
May.	1
Dryden.	1
In	1
a	1
retired	1
hamlet	1
on	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
Wales,	1
between	1
Oswestry	1
and	1
Shrewsbury,	1
it	1
is	1
still	1
the	1
custom	1
to	1
celebrate	1
the	1
1st	1
of	1
May.	1
The	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
village,	1
who	1
look	1
forward	1
to	1
this	1
rural	1
festival	1
with	1
joyful	1
eagerness,	1
usually	1
meet	1
on	1
the	1
last	1
day	1
of	1
April	1
to	1
make	1
up	1
their	1
nosegays	1
for	1
the	1
morning	1
and	1
to	1
choose	1
their	1
queen.	1
Their	1
customary	1
place	1
of	1
meeting	1
is	1
at	1
a	1
hawthorn,	1
which	1
stands	1
in	1
a	1
little	1
green	1
nook,	1
open	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
to	1
a	1
shady	1
lane,	1
and	1
separated	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
by	1
a	1
thick	1
sweet-brier	1
and	1
hawthorn	1
hedge	1
from	1
the	1
garden	1
of	1
an	1
attorney.	1
This	1
attorney	1
began	1
the	1
world	1
with	1
nothing,	1
but	1
he	1
contrived	1
to	1
scrape	1
together	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
of	1
money,	1
everybody	1
knew	1
how.	1
He	1
built	1
a	1
new	1
house	1
at	1
the	1
entrance	1
of	1
the	1
village,	1
and	1
had	1
a	1
large,	1
well	1
fenced	1
garden,	1
yet,	1
notwithstanding	1
his	1
fences,	1
he	1
never	1
felt	1
himself	1
secure.	1
Such	1
were	1
his	1
litigious	1
habits,	1
and	1
his	1
suspicious	1
temper,	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
constantly	1
at	1
variance	1
with	1
his	1
simple	1
and	1
peaceable	1
neighbours.	1
Some	1
pig,	1
or	1
dog,	1
or	1
goat,	1
or	1
goose	1
was	1
for	1
ever	1
trespassing.	1
His	1
complaints	1
and	1
his	1
extortions	1
wearied	1
and	1
alarmed	1
the	1
whole	1
hamlet.	1
The	1
paths	1
in	1
his	1
fields	1
were	1
at	1
length	1
unfrequented,	1
his	1
stiles	1
were	1
blocked	1
up	1
with	1
stones	1
or	1
stuffed	1
with	1
brambles	1
and	1
briers,	1
so	1
that	1
not	1
a	1
gosling	1
could	1
creep	1
under,	1
or	1
a	1
giant	1
get	1
over	1
them.	1
Indeed,	1
so	1
careful	1
were	1
even	1
the	1
village	1
children	1
of	1
giving	1
offence	1
to	1
this	1
irritable	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
law,	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
venture	1
to	1
fly	1
a	1
kite	1
near	1
his	1
fields	1
lest	1
it	1
should	1
entangle	1
in	1
his	1
trees,	1
or	1
fall	1
upon	1
his	1
meadow.	1
Mr.	1
Case,	1
for	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
our	1
attorney,	1
had	1
a	1
son	1
and	1
a	1
daughter,	1
to	1
whose	1
education	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
time	1
to	1
attend,	1
as	1
his	1
whole	1
soul	1
was	1
intent	1
upon	1
accumulating	1
for	1
them	1
a	1
fortune.	1
For	1
several	1
years	1
he	1
suffered	1
his	1
children	1
to	1
run	1
wild	1
in	1
the	1
village;	1
but	1
suddenly,	1
on	1
his	1
being	1
appointed	1
to	1
a	1
considerable	1
agency,	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
making	1
his	1
children	1
a	1
little	1
genteel.	1
He	1
sent	1
his	1
son	1
to	1
learn	1
Latin;	1
he	1
hired	1
a	1
maid	1
to	1
wait	1
upon	1
his	1
daughter	1
Barbara;	1
and	1
he	1
strictly	1
forbade	1
her	1
thenceforward	1
to	1
keep	1
company	1
with	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
poor	1
children,	1
who	1
had	1
hitherto	1
been	1
her	1
playfellows.	1
They	1
were	1
not	1
sorry	1
for	1
this	1
prohibition,	1
because	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
their	1
tyrant	1
rather	1
than	1
their	1
companion.	1
She	1
was	1
vexed	1
to	1
observe	1
that	1
her	1
absence	1
was	1
not	1
regretted,	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
mortified	1
to	1
perceive	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
humble	1
them	1
by	1
any	1
display	1
of	1
airs	1
and	1
finery.	1
There	1
was	1
one	1
poor	1
girl,	1
amongst	1
her	1
former	1
associates,	1
to	1
whom	1
she	1
had	1
a	1
peculiar	1
dislike,--Susan	1
Price,	1
a	1
sweet	1
tempered,	1
modest,	1
sprightly,	1
industrious	1
lass,	1
who	1
was	1
the	1
pride	1
and	1
delight	1
of	1
the	1
village.	1
Her	1
father	1
rented	1
a	1
small	1
farm,	1
and,	1
unfortunately	1
for	1
him,	1
he	1
lived	1
near	1
Attorney	1
Case.	1
Barbara	1
used	1
often	1
to	1
sit	1
at	1
her	1
window,	1
watching	1
Susan	1
at	1
work.	1
Sometimes	1
she	1
saw	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
neat	1
garden	1
raking	1
the	1
beds,	1
or	1
weeding	1
the	1
borders;	1
sometimes	1
she	1
was	1
kneeling	1
at	1
her	1
beehive	1
with	1
fresh	1
flowers	1
for	1
her	1
bees;	1
sometimes	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
poultry	1
yard,	1
scattering	1
corn	1
from	1
her	1
sieve	1
amongst	1
the	1
eager	1
chickens;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
she	1
was	1
often	1
seated	1
in	1
a	1
little	1
honeysuckle	1
arbour,	1
with	1
a	1
clean,	1
light,	1
three-legged	1
deal	1
table	1
before	1
her,	1
upon	1
which	1
she	1
put	1
her	1
plain	1
work.	1
Susan	1
had	1
been	1
taught	1
to	1
work	1
neatly	1
by	1
her	1
good	1
mother,	1
who	1
was	1
very	1
fond	1
of	1
her,	1
and	1
to	1
whom	1
she	1
was	1
most	1
gratefully	1
attached.	1
Mrs.	1
Price	1
was	1
an	1
intelligent,	1
active,	1
domestic	1
woman;	1
but	1
her	1
health	1
was	1
not	1
robust.	1
She	1
earned	1
money,	1
however,	1
by	1
taking	1
in	1
plain	1
work;	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
famous	1
for	1
baking	1
excellent	1
bread	1
and	1
breakfast	1
cakes.	1
She	1
was	1
respected	1
in	1
the	1
village,	1
for	1
her	1
conduct	1
as	1
a	1
wife	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
mother,	1
and	1
all	1
were	1
eager	1
to	1
show	1
her	1
attention.	1
At	1
her	1
door	1
the	1
first	1
branch	1
of	1
hawthorn	1
was	1
always	1
placed	1
on	1
May	1
morning,	1
and	1
her	1
Susan	1
was	1
usually	1
Queen	1
of	1
the	1
May.	1
It	1
was	1
now	1
time	1
to	1
choose	1
the	1
Queen.	1
The	1
setting	1
sun	1
shone	1
full	1
upon	1
the	1
pink	1
blossoms	1
of	1
the	1
hawthorn,	1
when	1
the	1
merry	1
group	1
assembled	1
upon	1
their	1
little	1
green.	1
Barbara	1
was	1
now	1
walking	1
in	1
sullen	1
state	1
in	1
her	1
father's	1
garden.	1
She	1
heard	1
the	1
busy	1
voices	1
in	1
the	1
lane,	1
and	1
she	1
concealed	1
herself	1
behind	1
the	1
high	1
hedge,	1
that	1
she	1
might	1
listen	1
to	1
their	1
conversation.	1
"Where's	1
Susan?"	1
were	1
the	1
first	1
unwelcome	1
words	1
which	1
she	1
overheard.	1
"Ay,	1
where's	1
Susan?"	1
repeated	1
Philip,	1
stopping	1
short	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
a	1
new	1
tune	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
playing	1
on	1
his	1
pipe.	1
"I	1
wish	1
Susan	1
would	1
come!	1
I	1
want	1
her	1
to	1
sing	1
me	1
this	1
same	1
tune	1
over	1
again;	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
it	1
yet."	1
"And	1
I	1
wish	1
Susan	1
would	1
come,	1
I'm	1
sure,"	1
cried	1
a	1
little	1
girl,	1
whose	1
lap	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
primroses.	1
"Susan	1
will	1
give	1
me	1
some	1
thread	1
to	1
tie	1
up	1
my	1
nosegays,	1
and	1
she'll	1
show	1
me	1
where	1
the	1
fresh	1
violets	1
grow;	1
and	1
she	1
has	1
promised	1
to	1
give	1
me	1
a	1
great	1
bunch	1
of	1
her	1
double	1
cowslips	1
to	1
wear	1
to-	1
morrow.	1
I	1
wish	1
she	1
would	1
come."	1
"Nothing	1
can	1
be	1
done	1
without	1
Susan!	1
She	1
always	1
shows	1
us	1
where	1
the	1
nicest	1
flowers	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
lanes	1
and	1
meadows,"	1
said	1
they.	1
"She	1
must	1
make	1
up	1
the	1
garlands;	1
and	1
she	1
shall	1
be	1
Queen	1
of	1
the	1
May!"	1
exclaimed	1
a	1
multitude	1
of	1
little	1
voices.	1
"But	1
she	1
does	1
not	1
come!"	1
said	1
Philip.	1
Rose,	1
who	1
was	1
her	1
particular	1
friend,	1
now	1
came	1
forward	1
to	1
assure	1
the	1
impatient	1
assembly,	1
"that	1
she	1
would	1
answer	1
for	1
it	1
Susan	1
would	1
come	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
possibly	1
could,	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
probably	1
was	1
detained	1
by	1
business	1
at	1
home."	1
The	1
little	1
electors	1
thought	1
that	1
all	1
business	1
should	1
give	1
way	1
to	1
theirs,	1
and	1
Rose	1
was	1
dispatched	1
to	1
summon	1
her	1
friend	1
immediately.	1
"Tell	1
her	1
to	1
make	1
haste,"	1
cried	1
Philip.	1
"Attorney	1
Case	1
dined	1
at	1
the	1
Abbey	1
to-day--luckily	1
for	1
us.	1
If	1
he	1
comes	1
home	1
and	1
finds	1
us	1
here,	1
maybe	1
he'll	1
drive	1
us	1
away;	1
for	1
he	1
says	1
this	1
bit	1
of	1
ground	1
belongs	1
to	1
his	1
garden:	1
though	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
true,	1
I'm	1
sure;	1
for	1
Farmer	1
Price	1
knows,	1
and	1
says,	1
it	1
was	1
always	1
open	1
to	1
the	1
road.	1
The	1
Attorney	1
wants	1
to	1
get	1
our	1
playground,	1
so	1
he	1
does.	1
I	1
wish	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
daughter	1
Bab,	1
or	1
Miss	1
Barbara,	1
as	1
she	1
must	1
now	1
be	1
called,	1
were	1
a	1
hundred	1
miles	1
off,	1
out	1
of	1
our	1
way,	1
I	1
know.	1
No	1
later	1
than	1
yesterday	1
she	1
threw	1
down	1
my	1
nine-pins	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
ill-humours,	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
walking	1
by	1
with	1
her	1
gown	1
all	1
trailing	1
in	1
the	1
dust."	1
"Yes,"	1
cried	1
Mary,	1
the	1
little	1
primrose-girl,	1
"her	1
gown	1
is	1
always	1
trailing.	1
She	1
does	1
not	1
hold	1
it	1
up	1
nicely,	1
like	1
Susan;	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
her	1
fine	1
clothes	1
she	1
never	1
looks	1
half	1
so	1
neat.	1
Mamma	1
says	1
she	1
wishes	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
like	1
Susan,	1
when	1
I	1
grow	1
up	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
great	1
girl,	1
and	1
so	1
do	1
I.	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
like	1
to	1
look	1
conceited	1
as	1
Barbara	1
does,	1
if	1
I	1
was	1
ever	1
so	1
rich."	1
"Rich	1
or	1
poor,"	1
said	1
Philip,	1
"it	1
does	1
not	1
become	1
a	1
girl	1
to	1
look	1
conceited,	1
much	1
less	1
BOLD,	1
as	1
Barbara	1
did	1
the	1
other	1
day,	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
at	1
her	1
father's	1
door	1
without	1
a	1
hat	1
upon	1
her	1
head,	1
staring	1
at	1
the	1
strange	1
gentleman	1
who	1
stopped	1
hereabout	1
to	1
let	1
his	1
horse	1
drink.	1
I	1
know	1
what	1
he	1
thought	1
of	1
Bab	1
by	1
his	1
looks,	1
and	1
of	1
Susan,	1
too;	1
for	1
Susan	1
was	1
in	1
her	1
garden,	1
bending	1
down	1
a	1
branch	1
of	1
the	1
laburnum-tree,	1
looking	1
at	1
its	1
yellow	1
flowers,	1
which	1
were	1
just	1
come	1
out;	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
gentleman	1
asked	1
her	1
how	1
many	1
miles	1
it	1
was	1
from	1
Shrewsbury,	1
she	1
answered	1
him	1
so	1
modest!--not	1
bashful,	1
like	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
nobody	1
before--but	1
just	1
right;	1
and	1
then	1
she	1
pulled	1
on	1
her	1
straw	1
hat,	1
which	1
was	1
fallen	1
back	1
with	1
her	1
looking	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
laburnum,	1
and	1
she	1
went	1
her	1
ways	1
home;	1
and	1
the	1
gentleman	1
says	1
to	1
me,	1
after	1
she	1
was	1
gone,	1
'Pray,	1
who	1
is	1
that	1
neat,	1
modest	1
girl--?'	1
But	1
I	1
wish	1
Susan	1
would	1
come,"	1
cried	1
Philip,	1
interrupting	1
himself,	1
Susan	1
was	1
all	1
this	1
time,	1
as	1
her	1
friend	1
Rose	1
rightly	1
guessed,	1
busy	1
at	1
home.	1
She	1
was	1
detained	1
by	1
her	1
father's	1
returning	1
later	1
than	1
usual.	1
His	1
supper	1
was	1
ready	1
for	1
him	1
nearly	1
an	1
hour	1
before	1
he	1
came	1
home;	1
and	1
Susan	1
swept	1
up	1
the	1
ashes	1
twice,	1
and	1
twice	1
put	1
on	1
wood	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
cheerful	1
blaze	1
for	1
him;	1
but	1
at	1
last,	1
when	1
he	1
did	1
come	1
in,	1
he	1
took	1
no	1
notice	1
of	1
the	1
blaze	1
or	1
of	1
Susan;	1
and	1
when	1
his	1
wife	1
asked	1
him	1
how	1
he	1
did,	1
he	1
made	1
no	1
answer,	1
but	1
stood	1
with	1
his	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
fire,	1
looking	1
very	1
gloomy.	1
Susan	1
put	1
his	1
supper	1
upon	1
the	1
table,	1
and	1
set	1
his	1
own	1
chair	1
for	1
him;	1
but	1
he	1
pushed	1
away	1
the	1
chair	1
and	1
turned	1
from	1
the	1
table,	1
saying--"I	1
shall	1
eat	1
nothing,	1
child!	1
Why	1
have	1
you	1
such	1
a	1
fire	1
to	1
roast	1
me	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
year?"	1
"You	1
said	1
yesterday,	1
father,	1
I	1
thought,	1
that	1
you	1
liked	1
a	1
little	1
cheerful	1
wood	1
fire	1
in	1
the	1
evening;	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
shower	1
of	1
hail;	1
your	1
coat	1
is	1
quite	1
wet,	1
we	1
must	1
dry	1
it."	1
"Take	1
it,	1
then,	1
child,"	1
said	1
he,	1
pulling	1
it	1
off--"I	1
shall	1
soon	1
have	1
no	1
coat	1
to	1
dry--and	1
take	1
my	1
hat,	1
too,"	1
said	1
he,	1
throwing	1
it	1
upon	1
the	1
ground.	1
Susan	1
hung	1
up	1
his	1
hat,	1
put	1
his	1
coat	1
over	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
a	1
chair	1
to	1
dry,	1
and	1
then	1
stood	1
anxiously	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
mother,	1
who	1
was	1
not	1
well;	1
she	1
had	1
this	1
day	1
fatigued	1
herself	1
with	1
baking;	1
and	1
now,	1
alarmed	1
by	1
her	1
husband's	1
moody	1
behaviour,	1
she	1
sat	1
down	1
pale	1
and	1
trembling.	1
He	1
threw	1
himself	1
into	1
a	1
chair,	1
folded	1
his	1
arms,	1
and	1
fixed	1
his	1
eyes	1
upon	1
the	1
fire.	1
Susan	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
who	1
ventured	1
to	1
break	1
silence.	1
Happy	1
the	1
father	1
who	1
has	1
such	1
a	1
daughter	1
as	1
Susan!--her	1
unaltered	1
sweetness	1
of	1
temper,	1
and	1
her	1
playful,	1
affectionate	1
caresses,	1
at	1
last	1
somewhat	1
dissipated	1
her	1
father's	1
melancholy.	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
prevailed	1
upon	1
to	1
eat	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
supper	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
prepared	1
for	1
him;	1
however,	1
with	1
a	1
faint	1
smile,	1
he	1
told	1
Susan	1
that	1
he	1
thought	1
he	1
could	1
eat	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
guinea-hen's	1
eggs.	1
She	1
thanked	1
him,	1
and	1
with	1
that	1
nimble	1
alacrity	1
which	1
marks	1
the	1
desire	1
to	1
please,	1
she	1
ran	1
to	1
her	1
neat	1
chicken-yard;	1
but,	1
alas!,	1
her	1
guinea-hen	1
was	1
not	1
there--it	1
had	1
strayed	1
into	1
the	1
attorney's	1
garden.	1
She	1
saw	1
it	1
through	1
the	1
paling,	1
and	1
timidly	1
opening	1
the	1
little	1
gate,	1
she	1
asked	1
Miss	1
Barbara,	1
who	1
was	1
walking	1
slowly	1
by,	1
to	1
let	1
her	1
come	1
in	1
and	1
take	1
her	1
guinea-hen.	1
Barbara,	1
who	1
was	1
at	1
this	1
instant	1
reflecting,	1
with	1
no	1
agreeable	1
feelings,	1
upon	1
the	1
conversation	1
of	1
the	1
village	1
children,	1
to	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
recently	1
listened,	1
started	1
when	1
she	1
heard	1
Susan's	1
voice,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
proud,	1
ill-humoured	1
look	1
and	1
voice,	1
refused	1
her	1
request.	1
"Shut	1
the	1
gate,"	1
said	1
Barbara,	1
"you	1
have	1
no	1
business	1
in	1
our	1
garden;	1
and	1
as	1
for	1
your	1
hen,	1
I	1
shall	1
keep	1
it;	1
it	1
is	1
always	1
flying	1
in	1
here,	1
and	1
plaguing	1
us,	1
and	1
my	1
father	1
says	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
trespasser;	1
and	1
he	1
told	1
me	1
I	1
might	1
catch	1
it	1
and	1
keep	1
it	1
the	1
next	1
time	1
it	1
got	1
in,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
now."	1
Then	1
Barbara	1
called	1
to	1
her	1
maid,	1
Betty,	1
and	1
bid	1
her	1
catch	1
the	1
mischievous	1
hen.	1
"Oh,	1
my	1
guinea-hen!	1
my	1
pretty	1
guinea-hen!"	1
cried	1
Susan,	1
as	1
they	1
hunted	1
the	1
frightened,	1
screaming	1
creature	1
from	1
corner	1
to	1
corner.	1
"Here	1
we	1
have	1
got	1
it!"	1
said	1
Betty,	1
holding	1
it	1
fast	1
by	1
the	1
legs.	1
"Now	1
pay	1
damages,	1
Queen	1
Susan,	1
or	1
good-bye	1
to	1
your	1
pretty	1
guinea-hen,"	1
said	1
Barbara,	1
in	1
an	1
insulting	1
tone.	1
"Damages!	1
what	1
damages?"	1
said	1
Susan;	1
"tell	1
me	1
what	1
I	1
must	1
pay."	1
"A	1
shilling,"	1
said	1
Barbara.	1
"Oh,	1
if	1
sixpence	1
would	1
do!"	1
said	1
Susan;	1
"I	1
have	1
but	1
sixpence	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
here	1
it	1
is."	1
"It	1
won't	1
do,"	1
said	1
Barbara,	1
turning	1
her	1
back.	1
"Nay,	1
but	1
hear	1
me,"	1
cried	1
Susan;	1
"let	1
me	1
at	1
least	1
come	1
in	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
its	1
eggs.	1
I	1
only	1
want	1
ONE	1
for	1
my	1
father's	1
supper;	1
you	1
shall	1
have	1
all	1
the	1
rest."	1
"What's	1
your	1
father,	1
or	1
his	1
supper	1
to	1
us?	1
is	1
he	1
so	1
nice	1
that	1
he	1
can	1
eat	1
none	1
but	1
guinea-hen's	1
eggs?"	1
said	1
Barbara.	1
"If	1
you	1
want	1
your	1
hen	1
and	1
your	1
eggs,	1
pay	1
for	1
them,	1
and	1
you'll	1
have	1
them."	1
"I	1
have	1
but	1
sixpence,	1
and	1
you	1
say	1
that	1
won't	1
do,"	1
said	1
Susan	1
with	1
a	1
sigh,	1
as	1
she	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
favourite,	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
maid's	1
grasping	1
hands,	1
struggling	1
and	1
screaming	1
in	1
vain.	1
Susan	1
retired	1
disconsolate.	1
At	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
her	1
father's	1
cottage	1
she	1
saw	1
her	1
friend	1
Rose,	1
who	1
was	1
just	1
come	1
to	1
summon	1
her	1
to	1
the	1
hawthorn	1
bush.	1
"They	1
are	1
all	1
at	1
the	1
hawthorn,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
come	1
for	1
you.	1
We	1
can	1
do	1
nothing	1
without	1
YOU,	1
dear	1
Susan,"	1
cried	1
Rose,	1
running	1
to	1
meet	1
her,	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
she	1
saw	1
her.	1
"You	1
are	1
chosen	1
Queen	1
of	1
the	1
May--come,	1
make	1
haste.	1
But	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
matter?	1
why	1
do	1
you	1
look	1
so	1
sad?"	1
"Ah!"	1
said	1
Susan,	1
"don't	1
wait	1
for	1
me;	1
I	1
can't	1
come	1
to	1
you,	1
but,"	1
added	1
she,	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
tuft	1
of	1
double	1
cowslips	1
in	1
the	1
garden,	1
"gather	1
those	1
for	1
poor	1
little	1
Mary;	1
I	1
promised	1
them	1
to	1
her,	1
and	1
tell	1
her	1
the	1
violets	1
are	1
under	1
a	1
hedge	1
just	1
opposite	1
the	1
turnstile,	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
as	1
we	1
go	1
to	1
church.	1
Good-bye!	1
never	1
mind	1
me;	1
I	1
can't	1
come--I	1
can't	1
stay,	1
for	1
my	1
father	1
wants	1
me."	1
"But	1
don't	1
turn	1
away	1
your	1
face;	1
I	1
won't	1
keep	1
you	1
a	1
moment;	1
only	1
tell	1
me	1
what's	1
the	1
matter,"	1
said	1
her	1
friend,	1
following	1
her	1
into	1
the	1
cottage.	1
"Oh,	1
nothing,	1
not	1
much,"	1
said	1
Susan;	1
"only	1
that	1
I	1
wanted	1
the	1
egg	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
hurry	1
for	1
father,	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
vexed	1
me--to	1
be	1
sure	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
clipped	1
my	1
guinea-hen's	1
wings,	1
and	1
then	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
flown	1
over	1
the	1
hedge;	1
but	1
let	1
us	1
think	1
no	1
more	1
about	1
it,	1
now,"	1
added	1
she,	1
twinkling	1
away	1
a	1
tear.	1
When	1
Rose,	1
however,	1
learnt	1
that	1
her	1
friend's	1
guinea-hen	1
was	1
detained	1
prisoner	1
by	1
the	1
attorney's	1
daughter,	1
she	1
exclaimed,	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
honest	1
warmth	1
of	1
indignation,	1
and	1
instantly	1
ran	1
back	1
to	1
tell	1
the	1
story	1
to	1
her	1
companions.	1
"Barbara!	1
ay;	1
like	1
father,	1
like	1
daughter,"	1
cried	1
Farmer	1
Price,	1
starting	1
from	1
the	1
thoughtful	1
attitude	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
fixed,	1
and	1
drawing	1
his	1
chair	1
closer	1
to	1
his	1
wife.	1
"You	1
see	1
something	1
is	1
amiss	1
with	1
me,	1
wife--I'll	1
tell	1
you	1
what	1
it	1
is."	1
As	1
he	1
lowered	1
his	1
voice,	1
Susan,	1
who	1
was	1
not	1
sure	1
that	1
he	1
wished	1
she	1
should	1
hear	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
say,	1
retired	1
from	1
behind	1
his	1
chair.	1
"Susan,	1
don't	1
go;	1
sit	1
you	1
down	1
here,	1
my	1
sweet	1
Susan,"	1
said	1
he,	1
making	1
room	1
for	1
her	1
upon	1
his	1
chair;	1
"I	1
believe	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
cross	1
when	1
I	1
came	1
in	1
first	1
tonight;	1
but	1
I	1
had	1
something	1
to	1
vex	1
me,	1
as	1
you	1
shall	1
hear.	1
"About	1
a	1
fortnight	1
ago,	1
you	1
know,	1
wife,"	1
continued	1
he,	1
"there	1
was	1
a	1
balloting	1
in	1
our	1
town	1
for	1
the	1
militia;	1
now	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
I	1
wanted	1
but	1
ten	1
days	1
of	1
forty	1
years	1
of	1
age;	1
and	1
the	1
attorney	1
told	1
me	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
fool	1
for	1
not	1
calling	1
myself	1
plump	1
forty.	1
But	1
the	1
truth	1
is	1
the	1
truth,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
what	1
I	1
think	1
fittest	1
to	1
be	1
spoken	1
at	1
all	1
times	1
come	1
what	1
will	1
of	1
it.	1
So	1
I	1
was	1
drawn	1
for	1
a	1
militiaman;	1
but	1
when	1
I	1
thought	1
how	1
loth	1
you	1
and	1
I	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
part,	1
I	1
was	1
main	1
glad	1
to	1
hear	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
get	1
off	1
by	1
paying	1
eight	1
or	1
nine	1
guineas	1
for	1
a	1
substitute--only	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
nine	1
guineas--for,	1
you	1
know,	1
we	1
had	1
bad	1
luck	1
with	1
our	1
sheep	1
this	1
year,	1
and	1
they	1
died	1
away	1
one	1
after	1
another--but	1
that	1
was	1
no	1
excuse,	1
so	1
I	1
went	1
to	1
Attorney	1
Case,	1
and,	1
with	1
a	1
power	1
of	1
difficulty,	1
I	1
got	1
him	1
to	1
lend	1
me	1
the	1
money;	1
for	1
which,	1
to	1
be	1
sure,	1
I	1
gave	1
him	1
something,	1
and	1
left	1
my	1
lease	1
of	1
our	1
farm	1
with	1
him,	1
as	1
he	1
insisted	1
upon	1
it,	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
security	1
for	1
the	1
loan.	1
Attorney	1
Case	1
is	1
too	1
many	1
for	1
me.	1
He	1
has	1
found	1
what	1
he	1
calls	1
a	1
flaw	1
in	1
my	1
lease;	1
and	1
the	1
lease,	1
he	1
tells	1
me,	1
is	1
not	1
worth	1
a	1
farthing,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
can	1
turn	1
us	1
all	1
out	1
of	1
our	1
farm	1
to-morrow	1
if	1
he	1
pleases;	1
and	1
sure	1
enough	1
he	1
will	1
please,	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
thwarted	1
him	1
this	1
day,	1
and	1
he	1
swears	1
he'll	1
be	1
revenged	1
of	1
me.	1
Indeed,	1
he	1
has	1
begun	1
with	1
me	1
badly	1
enough	1
already.	1
I'm	1
not	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
worst	1
part	1
of	1
my	1
story	1
yet--"	1
Here	1
Farmer	1
Price	1
made	1
a	1
dead	1
stop;	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
Susan	1
looked	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
face,	1
breathless	1
with	1
anxiety.	1
"It	1
must	1
come	1
out,"	1
said	1
he,	1
with	1
a	1
short	1
sigh;	1
"I	1
must	1
leave	1
you	1
in	1
three	1
days,	1
wife."	1
"Must	1
you?"	1
said	1
his	1
wife,	1
in	1
a	1
faint,	1
resigned	1
voice.	1
"Susan,	1
love,	1
open	1
the	1
window."	1
Susan	1
ran	1
to	1
open	1
the	1
window,	1
and	1
then	1
returned	1
to	1
support	1
her	1
mother's	1
head.	1
When	1
she	1
came	1
a	1
little	1
to	1
herself	1
she	1
sat	1
up,	1
begged	1
that	1
her	1
husband	1
would	1
go	1
on,	1
and	1
that	1
nothing	1
might	1
be	1
concealed	1
from	1
her.	1
Her	1
husband	1
had	1
no	1
wish	1
indeed	1
to	1
conceal	1
anything	1
from	1
a	1
wife	1
he	1
loved	1
so	1
well;	1
but,	1
firm	1
as	1
he	1
was,	1
and	1
steady	1
to	1
his	1
maxim,	1
that	1
the	1
truth	1
was	1
the	1
thing	1
the	1
fittest	1
to	1
be	1
spoken	1
at	1
all	1
times,	1
his	1
voice	1
faltered,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
with	1
great	1
difficulty	1
that	1
he	1
brought	1
himself	1
to	1
speak	1
the	1
whole	1
truth	1
at	1
this	1
moment.	1
The	1
fact	1
was	1
this.	1
Case	1
met	1
Farmer	1
Price	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
coming	1
home,	1
whistling,	1
from	1
a	1
new	1
ploughed	1
field.	1
The	1
attorney	1
had	1
just	1
dined	1
at	1
The	1
Abbey.	1
The	1
Abbey	1
was	1
the	1
family	1
seat	1
of	1
an	1
opulent	1
baronet	1
in	1
the	1
neighbourhood,	1
to	1
whom	1
Mr.	1
Case	1
had	1
been	1
agent.	1
The	1
baronet	1
died	1
suddenly,	1
and	1
his	1
estate	1
and	1
title	1
devolved	1
to	1
a	1
younger	1
brother,	1
who	1
was	1
now	1
just	1
arrived	1
in	1
the	1
country,	1
and	1
to	1
whom	1
Mr.	1
Case	1
was	1
eager	1
to	1
pay	1
his	1
court,	1
in	1
hopes	1
of	1
obtaining	1
his	1
favour.	1
Of	1
the	1
agency	1
he	1
flattered	1
himself	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
pretty	1
secure;	1
and	1
he	1
thought	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
assume	1
the	1
tone	1
of	1
command	1
towards	1
the	1
tenants,	1
especially	1
towards	1
one	1
who	1
was	1
some	1
guineas	1
in	1
debt,	1
and	1
in	1
whose	1
lease	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
flaw.	1
Accosting	1
the	1
farmer	1
in	1
a	1
haughty	1
manner,	1
the	1
attorney	1
began	1
with,	1
"So,	1
Farmer	1
Price,	1
a	1
word	1
with	1
you,	1
if	1
you	1
please.	1
Walk	1
on	1
here,	1
man,	1
beside	1
my	1
horse,	1
and	1
you'll	1
hear	1
me.	1
You	1
have	1
changed	1
your	1
opinion,	1
I	1
hope,	1
about	1
that	1
bit	1
of	1
land--that	1
corner	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
my	1
garden?"	1
"As	1
how,	1
Mr.	1
Case?"	1
said	1
the	1
farmer.	1
"As	1
how,	1
man!	1
Why,	1
you	1
said	1
something	1
about	1
its	1
not	1
belonging	1
to	1
me,	1
when	1
you	1
heard	1
me	1
talk	1
of	1
inclosing	1
it	1
the	1
other	1
day."	1
"So	1
I	1
did,"	1
said	1
Price,	1
"and	1
so	1
I	1
do."	1
Provoked	1
and	1
astonished	1
at	1
the	1
firm	1
tone	1
in	1
which	1
these	1
words	1
were	1
pronounced,	1
the	1
attorney	1
was	1
upon	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
swearing	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
his	1
revenge;	1
but,	1
as	1
his	1
passions	1
were	1
habitually	1
attentive	1
to	1
the	1
LETTER	1
of	1
the	1
law,	1
he	1
refrained	1
from	1
any	1
hasty	1
expression,	1
which	1
might,	1
he	1
was	1
aware,	1
in	1
a	1
court	1
of	1
justice,	1
be	1
hereafter	1
brought	1
against	1
him.	1
"My	1
good	1
friend,	1
Mr.	1
Price,"	1
said	1
he,	1
in	1
a	1
soft	1
voice,	1
and	1
pale	1
with	1
suppressed	1
rage.	1
He	1
forced	1
a	1
smile.	1
"I'm	1
under	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
calling	1
in	1
the	1
money	1
I	1
lent	1
you	1
some	1
time	1
ago,	1
and	1
you	1
will	1
please	1
to	1
take	1
notice,	1
that	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
paid	1
to-morrow	1
morning.	1
I	1
wish	1
you	1
a	1
good	1
evening.	1
You	1
have	1
the	1
money	1
ready	1
for	1
me,	1
I	1
daresay."	1
"No,"	1
said	1
the	1
farmer,	1
"not	1
a	1
guinea	1
of	1
it;	1
but	1
John	1
Simpson,	1
who	1
was	1
my	1
substitute,	1
has	1
not	1
left	1
our	1
village	1
yet.	1
I'll	1
get	1
the	1
money	1
back	1
from	1
him,	1
and	1
go	1
myself,	1
if	1
so	1
be	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
so,	1
into	1
the	1
militia--so	1
I	1
will."	1
The	1
attorney	1
did	1
not	1
expect	1
such	1
a	1
determination,	1
and	1
he	1
represented,	1
in	1
a	1
friendly,	1
hypocritical	1
tone	1
to	1
Price,	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
wish	1
to	1
drive	1
him	1
to	1
such	1
an	1
extremity;	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
folly	1
in	1
him	1
TO	1
RUN	1
HIS	1
HEAD	1
AGAINST	1
A	1
WALL	1
FOR	1
NO	1
PURPOSE.	1
"You	1
don't	1
mean	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
corner	1
into	1
your	1
own	1
garden,	1
do	1
you,	1
Price?"	1
said	1
he.	1
"I?"	1
said	1
the	1
farmer,	1
"God	1
forbid!	1
it's	1
none	1
of	1
mine,	1
I	1
never	1
take	1
what	1
does	1
not	1
belong	1
to	1
me."	1
"True,	1
right,	1
very	1
proper,	1
of	1
course,"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Case;	1
"but	1
then	1
you	1
have	1
no	1
interest	1
in	1
life	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
in	1
question?"	1
"None."	1
"Then	1
why	1
so	1
stiff	1
about	1
it,	1
Price?	1
All	1
I	1
want	1
of	1
you	1
to	1
say--"	1
"To	1
say	1
that	1
black	1
is	1
white,	1
which	1
I	1
won't	1
do,	1
Mr.	1
Case.	1
The	1
ground	1
is	1
a	1
thing	1
not	1
worth	1
talking	1
of;	1
but	1
it's	1
neither	1
yours	1
nor	1
mine.	1
In	1
my	1
memory,	1
since	1
the	1
NEW	1
lane	1
was	1
made,	1
it	1
has	1
always	1
been	1
open	1
to	1
the	1
parish;	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
shall	1
inclose	1
it	1
with	1
my	1
good-will.	1
Truth	1
is	1
truth,	1
and	1
must	1
be	1
spoken;	1
justice	1
is	1
justice,	1
and	1
should	1
be	1
done,	1
Mr.	1
Attorney."	1
"And	1
law	1
is	1
law,	1
Mr.	1
Farmer,	1
and	1
shall	1
have	1
its	1
course,	1
to	1
your	1
cost,"	1
cried	1
the	1
attorney,	1
exasperated	1
by	1
the	1
dauntless	1
spirit	1
of	1
this	1
village	1
Hampden.	1
Here	1
they	1
parted.	1
The	1
glow	1
of	1
enthusiasm,	1
the	1
pride	1
of	1
virtue,	1
which	1
made	1
our	1
hero	1
brave,	1
could	1
not	1
render	1
him	1
insensible.	1
As	1
he	1
drew	1
nearer	1
home,	1
many	1
melancholy	1
thoughts	1
pressed	1
upon	1
his	1
heart.	1
He	1
passed	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
cottage	1
with	1
resolute	1
steps,	1
however,	1
and	1
went	1
through	1
the	1
village	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
engaged	1
to	1
be	1
his	1
substitute.	1
He	1
found	1
him,	1
told	1
him	1
how	1
the	1
matter	1
stood;	1
and	1
luckily	1
the	1
man,	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
spent	1
the	1
money,	1
was	1
willing	1
to	1
return	1
it;	1
as	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
others	1
drawn	1
for	1
the	1
militia,	1
who,	1
he	1
observed,	1
would	1
be	1
glad	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
the	1
same	1
price,	1
or	1
more,	1
for	1
his	1
services.	1
The	1
moment	1
Price	1
got	1
the	1
money,	1
he	1
hastened	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Case's	1
house,	1
walked	1
straight	1
forward	1
into	1
his	1
room,	1
and	1
laying	1
the	1
money	1
down	1
upon	1
his	1
desk,	1
"There,	1
Mr.	1
Attorney,	1
are	1
your	1
nine	1
guineas;	1
count	1
them;	1
now	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
with	1
you."	1
"Not	1
yet,"	1
said	1
the	1
attorney,	1
jingling	1
the	1
money	1
triumphantly	1
in	1
his	1
hand.	1
"We'll	1
give	1
you	1
a	1
taste	1
of	1
the	1
law,	1
my	1
good	1
sir,	1
or	1
I'm	1
mistaken.	1
You	1
forgot	1
the	1
flaw	1
in	1
your	1
lease,	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
safe	1
in	1
this	1
desk."	1
"Ah,	1
my	1
lease,"	1
said	1
the	1
farmer,	1
who	1
had	1
almost	1
forgot	1
to	1
ask	1
for	1
it	1
till	1
he	1
was	1
thus	1
put	1
in	1
mind	1
of	1
it	1
by	1
the	1
attorney's	1
imprudent	1
threat.	1
"Give	1
me	1
my	1
lease,	1
Mr.	1
Case.	1
I've	1
paid	1
my	1
money;	1
you	1
have	1
no	1
right	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
lease	1
any	1
longer,	1
whether	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
bad	1
one	1
or	1
a	1
good	1
one."	1
"Pardon	1
me,"	1
said	1
the	1
attorney,	1
locking	1
his	1
desk,	1
and	1
putting	1
the	1
key	1
into	1
his	1
pocket,	1
"possession,	1
my	1
honest	1
friend,"	1
cried	1
he,	1
striking	1
his	1
hand	1
upon	1
the	1
desk,	1
"is	1
nine	1
points	1
of	1
the	1
law.	1
Good	1
night	1
to	1
you.	1
I	1
cannot	1
in	1
conscience	1
return	1
a	1
lease	1
to	1
a	1
tenant	1
in	1
which	1
I	1
know	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
capital	1
flaw.	1
It	1
is	1
my	1
duty	1
to	1
show	1
it	1
to	1
my	1
employer;	1
or,	1
in	1
other	1
words,	1
to	1
your	1
new	1
landlord,	1
whose	1
agent	1
I	1
have	1
good	1
reasons	1
to	1
expect	1
I	1
shall	1
be;	1
you	1
will	1
live	1
to	1
repent	1
your	1
obstinacy,	1
Mr.	1
Price.	1
Your	1
servant,	1
sir."	1
Price	1
retired	1
with	1
melancholy	1
feelings,	1
but	1
not	1
intimidated.	1
Many	1
a	1
man	1
returns	1
home	1
with	1
a	1
gloomy	1
countenance,	1
who	1
has	1
not	1
quite	1
so	1
much	1
cause	1
for	1
vexation.	1
When	1
Susan	1
heard	1
her	1
father's	1
story,	1
she	1
quite	1
forgot	1
her	1
guinea-hen,	1
and	1
her	1
whole	1
soul	1
was	1
intent	1
upon	1
her	1
poor	1
mother,	1
who,	1
notwithstanding	1
her	1
utmost	1
exertion,	1
could	1
not	1
support	1
herself	1
under	1
this	1
sudden	1
stroke	1
of	1
misfortune.	1
In	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
Susan	1
was	1
called	1
up;	1
her	1
mother's	1
fever	1
ran	1
high	1
for	1
some	1
hours;	1
but	1
towards	1
morning	1
it	1
abated,	1
and	1
she	1
fell	1
into	1
a	1
soft	1
sleep	1
with	1
Susan's	1
hand	1
locked	1
fast	1
in	1
hers.	1
Susan	1
sat	1
motionless,	1
and	1
breathed	1
softly,	1
lest	1
she	1
should	1
disturb	1
her.	1
The	1
rushlight,	1
which	1
stood	1
beside	1
the	1
bed,	1
was	1
now	1
burnt	1
low;	1
the	1
long	1
shadow	1
of	1
the	1
tall	1
wicker	1
chair	1
flitted,	1
faded,	1
appeared,	1
and	1
vanished,	1
as	1
the	1
flame	1
rose	1
and	1
sunk	1
in	1
the	1
socket.	1
Susan	1
was	1
afraid	1
that	1
the	1
disagreeable	1
smell	1
might	1
waken	1
her	1
mother;	1
and,	1
gently	1
disengaging	1
her	1
hand,	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
tiptoe	1
to	1
extinguish	1
the	1
candle.	1
All	1
was	1
silent:	1
the	1
grey	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
morning	1
was	1
now	1
spreading	1
over	1
every	1
object;	1
the	1
sun	1
rose	1
slowly,	1
and	1
Susan	1
stood	1
at	1
the	1
lattice	1
window,	1
looking	1
through	1
the	1
small	1
leaded,	1
cross-barred	1
panes	1
at	1
the	1
splendid	1
spectacle.	1
A	1
few	1
birds	1
began	1
to	1
chirp;	1
but,	1
as	1
Susan	1
was	1
listening	1
to	1
them,	1
her	1
mother	1
started	1
in	1
her	1
sleep,	1
and	1
spoke	1
unintelligibly.	1
Susan	1
hung	1
up	1
a	1
white	1
apron	1
before	1
the	1
window	1
to	1
keep	1
out	1
the	1
light,	1
and	1
just	1
then	1
she	1
heard	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
music	1
at	1
a	1
distance	1
in	1
the	1
village.	1
As	1
it	1
approached	1
nearer,	1
she	1
knew	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
Philip	1
playing	1
upon	1
his	1
pipe	1
and	1
tabor.	1
She	1
distinguished	1
the	1
merry	1
voices	1
of	1
her	1
companions	1
"carolling	1
in	1
honour	1
of	1
the	1
May,"	1
and	1
soon	1
she	1
saw	1
them	1
coming	1
towards	1
her	1
father's	1
cottage,	1
with	1
branches	1
and	1
garlands	1
in	1
their	1
hands.	1
She	1
opened	1
quick,	1
but	1
gently,	1
the	1
latch	1
of	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
ran	1
out	1
to	1
meet	1
them.	1
"Here	1
she	1
is!--here's	1
Susan!"	1
they	1
exclaimed,	1
joyfully.	1
"Here's	1
the	1
Queen	1
of	1
the	1
May."	1
"And	1
here's	1
her	1
crown!"	1
cried	1
Rose,	1
pressing	1
forward;	1
but	1
Susan	1
put	1
her	1
finger	1
upon	1
her	1
lips,	1
and	1
pointed	1
to	1
her	1
mother's	1
window.	1
Philip's	1
pipe	1
stopped	1
instantly.	1
"Thank	1
you,"	1
said	1
Susan,	1
"my	1
mother	1
is	1
ill;	1
I	1
can't	1
leave	1
her,	1
you	1
know."	1
Then	1
gently	1
putting	1
aside	1
the	1
crown,	1
her	1
companions	1
bid	1
her	1
say	1
who	1
should	1
wear	1
it	1
for	1
her.	1
"Will	1
you,	1
dear	1
Rose?"	1
said	1
she,	1
placing	1
the	1
garland	1
upon	1
her	1
friend's	1
head.	1
"It's	1
a	1
charming	1
May	1
morning,"	1
added	1
she,	1
with	1
a	1
smile;	1
"good-bye.	1
We	1
sha'n't	1
hear	1
your	1
voices	1
or	1
the	1
pipe	1
when	1
you	1
have	1
turned	1
the	1
corner	1
into	1
the	1
village;	1
so	1
you	1
need	1
only	1
stop	1
till	1
then,	1
Philip."	1
"I	1
shall	1
stop	1
for	1
all	1
day,"	1
said	1
Philip:	1
"I've	1
no	1
mind	1
to	1
play	1
any	1
more."	1
"Good-bye,	1
poor	1
Susan.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
pity	1
you	1
can't	1
come	1
with	1
us,"	1
said	1
all	1
the	1
children;	1
and	1
little	1
Mary	1
ran	1
after	1
Susan	1
to	1
the	1
cottage	1
door.	1
"I	1
forgot	1
to	1
thank	1
you,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"for	1
the	1
double	1
cowslips;	1
look	1
how	1
pretty	1
they	1
are,	1
and	1
smell	1
how	1
sweet	1
the	1
violets	1
are	1
in	1
my	1
bosom,	1
and	1
kiss	1
me	1
quick,	1
for	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
left	1
behind."	1
Susan	1
kissed	1
the	1
little	1
breathless	1
girl,	1
and	1
returned	1
softly	1
to	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
her	1
mother's	1
bed.	1
"How	1
grateful	1
that	1
child	1
is	1
to	1
me,	1
for	1
a	1
cowslip	1
only!	1
How	1
can	1
I	1
be	1
grateful	1
enough	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
mother	1
as	1
this?"	1
said	1
Susan	1
to	1
herself,	1
as	1
she	1
bent	1
over	1
her	1
sleeping	1
mother's	1
pale	1
countenance.	1
Her	1
mother's	1
unfinished	1
knitting	1
lay	1
upon	1
a	1
table	1
near	1
the	1
bed,	1
and	1
Susan	1
sat	1
down	1
in	1
her	1
wicker	1
arm-chair,	1
and	1
went	1
on	1
with	1
the	1
row,	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
which	1
her	1
hand	1
stopped	1
the	1
preceding	1
evening.	1
"She	1
taught	1
me	1
to	1
knit,	1
she	1
taught	1
me	1
everything	1
that	1
I	1
know,"	1
thought	1
Susan,	1
"and	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
all,	1
she	1
taught	1
me	1
to	1
love	1
her,	1
to	1
wish	1
to	1
be	1
like	1
her."	1
Her	1
mother,	1
when	1
she	1
awakened,	1
felt	1
much	1
refreshed	1
by	1
her	1
tranquil	1
sleep,	1
and	1
observing	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
delightful	1
morning,	1
said,	1
"that	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
dreaming	1
she	1
heard	1
music;	1
but	1
that	1
the	1
drum	1
frightened	1
her,	1
because	1
she	1
thought	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
signal	1
for	1
her	1
husband	1
to	1
be	1
carried	1
away	1
by	1
a	1
whole	1
regiment	1
of	1
soldiers,	1
who	1
had	1
pointed	1
their	1
bayonets	1
at	1
him.	1
But	1
that	1
was	1
but	1
a	1
dream,	1
Susan;	1
I	1
awoke,	1
and	1
knew	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
dream,	1
and	1
I	1
then	1
fell	1
asleep,	1
and	1
have	1
slept	1
soundly	1
ever	1
since."	1
How	1
painful	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
awake	1
to	1
the	1
remembrance	1
of	1
misfortune.	1
Gradually	1
as	1
this	1
poor	1
woman	1
collected	1
her	1
scattered	1
thoughts,	1
she	1
recalled	1
the	1
circumstances	1
of	1
the	1
preceding	1
evening.	1
She	1
was	1
too	1
certain	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
heard	1
from	1
her	1
husband's	1
own	1
lips	1
the	1
words,	1
"I	1
MUST	1
LEAVE	1
YOU	1
IN	1
THREE	1
DAYS";	1
and	1
she	1
wished	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
sleep	1
again,	1
and	1
think	1
it	1
all	1
a	1
dream.	1
"But	1
he'll	1
want,	1
he'll	1
want	1
a	1
hundred	1
things,"	1
said	1
she,	1
starting	1
up.	1
"I	1
must	1
get	1
his	1
linen	1
ready	1
for	1
him.	1
I'm	1
afraid	1
it's	1
very	1
late.	1
Susan,	1
why	1
did	1
you	1
let	1
me	1
lie	1
so	1
long?"	1
"Everything	1
shall	1
be	1
ready,	1
dear	1
mother;	1
only	1
don't	1
hurry	1
yourself,"	1
said	1
Susan.	1
And	1
indeed	1
her	1
mother	1
was	1
ill	1
able	1
to	1
bear	1
any	1
hurry,	1
or	1
to	1
do	1
any	1
work	1
this	1
day.	1
Susan's	1
affectionate,	1
dexterous,	1
sensible	1
activity	1
was	1
never	1
more	1
wanted,	1
or	1
more	1
effectual.	1
She	1
understood	1
so	1
readily,	1
she	1
obeyed	1
so	1
exactly;	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
left	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
discretion,	1
judged	1
so	1
prudently,	1
that	1
her	1
mother	1
had	1
little	1
trouble	1
and	1
no	1
anxiety	1
in	1
directing	1
her.	1
She	1
said	1
that	1
Susan	1
never	1
did	1
too	1
little,	1
or	1
too	1
much.	1
Susan	1
was	1
mending	1
her	1
father's	1
linen,	1
when	1
Rose	1
tapped	1
softly	1
at	1
the	1
window,	1
and	1
beckoned	1
to	1
her	1
to	1
come	1
out.	1
She	1
went	1
out.	1
"How	1
does	1
your	1
mother	1
do,	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
place?"	1
said	1
Rose.	1
"Better,	1
thank	1
you."	1
"That's	1
well,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
little	1
bit	1
of	1
good	1
news	1
for	1
you	1
besides--	1
here,"	1
said	1
she,	1
pulling	1
out	1
a	1
glove,	1
in	1
which	1
there	1
was	1
money,	1
"we'll	1
get	1
the	1
guinea-hen	1
back	1
again--we	1
have	1
all	1
agreed	1
about	1
it.	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
money	1
that	1
has	1
been	1
given	1
to	1
us	1
in	1
the	1
village	1
this	1
May	1
morning.	1
At	1
every	1
door	1
they	1
gave	1
silver.	1
See	1
how	1
generous	1
they	1
have	1
been--twelve	1
shillings,	1
I	1
assure	1
you.	1
Now	1
we	1
are	1
a	1
match	1
for	1
Miss	1
Barbara.	1
You	1
won't	1
like	1
to	1
leave	1
home;	1
I'll	1
go	1
to	1
Barbara,	1
and	1
you	1
shall	1
see	1
your	1
guinea-hen	1
in	1
ten	1
minutes."	1
Rose	1
hurried	1
away,	1
pleased	1
with	1
her	1
commission,	1
and	1
to	1
accomplish	1
her	1
business.	1
Miss	1
Barbara's	1
maid	1
Betty	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
person	1
that	1
was	1
visible	1
at	1
the	1
attorney's	1
house.	1
Rose	1
insisted	1
upon	1
seeing	1
Miss	1
Barbara	1
herself,	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
shown	1
into	1
a	1
parlour	1
to	1
the	1
young	1
lady,	1
who	1
was	1
reading	1
a	1
dirty	1
novel,	1
which	1
she	1
put	1
under	1
a	1
heap	1
of	1
law	1
papers	1
as	1
they	1
entered.	1
"Dear,	1
how	1
you	1
STARTLED	1
me!	1
Is	1
it	1
only	1
you?"	1
said	1
she	1
to	1
her	1
maid;	1
but	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
saw	1
Rose	1
behind	1
the	1
maid,	1
she	1
put	1
on	1
a	1
scornful	1
air.	1
"Could	1
not	1
ye	1
say	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
at	1
home,	1
Betty?	1
Well,	1
my	1
good	1
girl,	1
what	1
brings	1
you	1
here?	1
Something	1
to	1
borrow	1
or	1
beg,	1
I	1
suppose."	1
May	1
every	1
ambassador--every	1
ambassador	1
in	1
as	1
good	1
a	1
cause--answer	1
with	1
as	1
much	1
dignity	1
and	1
moderation	1
as	1
Rose	1
replied	1
to	1
Barbara	1
upon	1
the	1
present	1
occasion.	1
She	1
assured	1
her,	1
that	1
the	1
person	1
from	1
whom	1
she	1
came	1
did	1
not	1
send	1
her	1
either	1
to	1
beg	1
or	1
borrow;	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
pay	1
the	1
full	1
value	1
of	1
that	1
for	1
which	1
she	1
came	1
to	1
ask;	1
and,	1
producing	1
her	1
well	1
filled	1
purse,	1
"I	1
believe	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
shilling,"	1
said	1
she.	1
"If	1
you	1
don't	1
like	1
it,	1
I	1
will	1
change	1
it,	1
and	1
now	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
so	1
good	1
as	1
to	1
give	1
me	1
Susan's	1
guinea-hen.	1
It	1
is	1
in	1
her	1
name	1
I	1
ask	1
for	1
it."	1
"No	1
matter	1
in	1
whose	1
name	1
you	1
ask	1
for	1
it,"	1
replied	1
Barbara,	1
"you	1
will	1
not	1
have	1
it.	1
Take	1
up	1
your	1
shilling,	1
if	1
you	1
please.	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
taken	1
a	1
shilling	1
yesterday,	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
paid	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
properly;	1
but	1
I	1
told	1
Susan,	1
that	1
if	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
paid	1
then,	1
I	1
should	1
keep	1
the	1
hen,	1
and	1
so	1
I	1
shall,	1
I	1
promise	1
her.	1
You	1
may	1
go	1
back,	1
and	1
tell	1
her	1
so."	1
The	1
attorney's	1
daughter	1
had,	1
whilst	1
Rose	1
opened	1
her	1
negotiation,	1
measured	1
the	1
depth	1
of	1
her	1
purse	1
with	1
a	1
keen	1
eye;	1
and	1
her	1
penetration	1
discovered	1
that	1
it	1
contained	1
at	1
least	1
ten	1
shillings.	1
With	1
proper	1
management	1
she	1
had	1
some	1
hopes	1
that	1
the	1
guinea-hen	1
might	1
be	1
made	1
to	1
bring	1
in	1
at	1
least	1
half	1
the	1
money.	1
Rose,	1
who	1
was	1
of	1
a	1
warm	1
temper,	1
not	1
quite	1
so	1
fit	1
a	1
match	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
thought	1
herself	1
for	1
the	1
wily	1
Barbara,	1
incautiously	1
exclaimed,	1
"Whatever	1
it	1
costs	1
us,	1
we	1
are	1
determined	1
to	1
have	1
Susan's	1
favourite	1
hen;	1
so,	1
if	1
one	1
shilling	1
won't	1
do,	1
take	1
two;	1
and	1
if	1
two	1
won't	1
do,	1
why,	1
take	1
three."	1
The	1
shillings	1
sounded	1
provoking	1
upon	1
the	1
table,	1
as	1
she	1
threw	1
them	1
down	1
one	1
after	1
another,	1
and	1
Barbara	1
coolly	1
replied,	1
"Three	1
won't	1
do."	1
"Have	1
you	1
no	1
conscience,	1
Miss	1
Barbara?	1
Then	1
take	1
four."	1
Barbara	1
shook	1
her	1
head.	1
A	1
fifth	1
shilling	1
was	1
instantly	1
proffered;	1
but	1
Bab,	1
who	1
now	1
saw	1
plainly	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
the	1
game	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
hands,	1
preserved	1
a	1
cold,	1
cruel	1
silence.	1
Rose	1
went	1
on	1
rapidly,	1
bidding	1
shilling	1
after	1
shilling,	1
till	1
she	1
had	1
completely	1
emptied	1
her	1
purse.	1
The	1
twelve	1
shillings	1
were	1
spread	1
upon	1
the	1
table.	1
Barbara's	1
avarice	1
was	1
moved,	1
she	1
consented	1
for	1
this	1
ransom	1
to	1
liberate	1
her	1
prisoner.	1
Rose	1
pushed	1
the	1
money	1
towards	1
her;	1
but	1
just	1
then,	1
recollecting	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
acting	1
for	1
others	1
more	1
than	1
for	1
herself,	1
and	1
doubting	1
whether	1
she	1
had	1
full	1
powers	1
to	1
conclude	1
such	1
an	1
extravagant	1
bargain,	1
she	1
gathered	1
up	1
the	1
public	1
treasure,	1
and	1
with	1
newly-recovered	1
prudence	1
observed	1
that	1
she	1
must	1
go	1
back	1
to	1
consult	1
her	1
friends.	1
Her	1
generous	1
little	1
friends	1
were	1
amazed	1
at	1
Barbara's	1
meanness,	1
but	1
with	1
one	1
accord	1
declared	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
most	1
willing,	1
for	1
their	1
parts,	1
to	1
give	1
up	1
every	1
farthing	1
of	1
the	1
money.	1
They	1
all	1
went	1
to	1
Susan	1
in	1
a	1
body,	1
and	1
told	1
her	1
so.	1
"There's	1
our	1
purse,"	1
said	1
they;	1
"do	1
what	1
you	1
please	1
with	1
it."	1
They	1
would	1
not	1
wait	1
for	1
one	1
word	1
of	1
thanks,	1
but	1
ran	1
away,	1
leaving	1
only	1
Rose	1
with	1
her	1
to	1
settle	1
the	1
treaty	1
for	1
the	1
guinea-hen.	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
certain	1
manner	1
of	1
accepting	1
a	1
favour,	1
which	1
shows	1
true	1
generosity	1
of	1
mind.	1
Many	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
give,	1
but	1
few	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
accept	1
a	1
gift	1
properly.	1
Susan	1
was	1
touched,	1
but	1
not	1
astonished,	1
by	1
the	1
kindness	1
of	1
her	1
young	1
friends,	1
and	1
she	1
received	1
the	1
purse	1
with	1
as	1
much	1
simplicity	1
as	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
given	1
it.	1
"Well,"	1
said	1
Rose,	1
"shall	1
I	1
go	1
back	1
for	1
the	1
guinea-hen?"	1
"The	1
guinea-hen!"	1
said	1
Susan,	1
starting	1
from	1
a	1
reverie	1
into	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
fallen,	1
as	1
she	1
contemplated	1
the	1
purse.	1
"Certainly	1
I	1
DO	1
long	1
to	1
see	1
my	1
pretty	1
guinea-hen	1
once	1
more;	1
but	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
thinking	1
of	1
her	1
just	1
then--I	1
was	1
thinking	1
of	1
my	1
father."	1
Now	1
Susan	1
had	1
heard	1
her	1
mother	1
often,	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
this	1
day,	1
wish	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
but	1
money	1
enough	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
pay	1
John	1
Simpson	1
for	1
going	1
to	1
serve	1
in	1
the	1
militia	1
instead	1
of	1
her	1
husband.	1
"This,	1
to	1
be	1
sure,	1
will	1
go	1
but	1
a	1
little	1
way,"	1
thought	1
Susan;	1
"but	1
still	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
of	1
some	1
use	1
to	1
my	1
father."	1
She	1
told	1
her	1
mind	1
to	1
Rose,	1
and	1
concluded	1
by	1
saying,	1
decidedly,	1
that	1
"if	1
the	1
money	1
was	1
given	1
to	1
her	1
to	1
dispose	1
of	1
as	1
she	1
pleased,	1
she	1
would	1
give	1
it	1
to	1
her	1
father."	1
"It	1
is	1
all	1
yours,	1
my	1
dear,	1
good	1
Susan,"	1
cried	1
Rose,	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
warm	1
approbation.	1
"This	1
is	1
so	1
like	1
you--but	1
I'm	1
sorry	1
that	1
Miss	1
Bab	1
must	1
keep	1
your	1
guinea-hen.	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
her	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
guinea-hens,	1
or	1
guineas	1
either,	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
world.	1
Why,	1
I'll	1
answer	1
for	1
it,	1
the	1
guinea-hen	1
won't	1
make	1
her	1
happy,	1
and	1
you'll	1
be	1
happy	1
EVEN	1
without;	1
because	1
you	1
are	1
good.	1
Let	1
me	1
come	1
and	1
help	1
you	1
to-morrow,"	1
continued	1
she,	1
looking	1
at	1
Susan's	1
work,	1
"if	1
you	1
have	1
any	1
more	1
mending	1
work	1
to	1
do--I	1
never	1
liked	1
work	1
till	1
I	1
worked	1
with	1
you.	1
I	1
won't	1
forget	1
my	1
thimble	1
or	1
my	1
scissors,"	1
added	1
she,	1
laughing--"though	1
I	1
used	1
to	1
forget	1
them	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
giddy	1
girl.	1
I	1
assure	1
you	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
great	1
hand	1
at	1
my	1
needle,	1
now--try	1
me."	1
Susan	1
assured	1
her	1
friend	1
that	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
doubt	1
the	1
powers	1
of	1
her	1
needle,	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
most	1
willingly	1
accept	1
of	1
her	1
services,	1
but	1
that	1
UNLUCKILY	1
she	1
had	1
finished	1
all	1
the	1
needle	1
work	1
immediately	1
wanted.	1
"But	1
do	1
you	1
know,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"I	1
shall	1
have	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
business	1
to-	1
morrow;	1
but	1
I	1
won't	1
tell	1
you	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
do,	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
succeed;	1
but	1
if	1
I	1
do	1
succeed,	1
I'll	1
come	1
and	1
tell	1
you	1
directly,	1
because	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
so	1
glad	1
of	1
it."	1
Susan,	1
who	1
had	1
always	1
been	1
attentive	1
to	1
what	1
her	1
mother	1
taught	1
her,	1
and	1
who	1
had	1
often	1
assisted	1
her	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
baking	1
bread	1
and	1
cakes	1
for	1
the	1
family	1
at	1
the	1
Abbey,	1
had	1
now	1
formed	1
the	1
courageous,	1
but	1
not	1
presumptuous	1
idea,	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
herself	1
undertake	1
to	1
bake	1
a	1
batch	1
of	1
bread.	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
servants	1
from	1
the	1
Abbey	1
had	1
been	1
sent	1
all	1
round	1
the	1
village	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
bread,	1
and	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
procure	1
any	1
that	1
was	1
tolerable.	1
Mrs.	1
Price's	1
last	1
baking	1
failed	1
for	1
want	1
of	1
good	1
barm.	1
She	1
was	1
not	1
now	1
strong	1
enough	1
to	1
attempt	1
another	1
herself;	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
brewer's	1
boy	1
came	1
with	1
eagerness	1
to	1
tell	1
her	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
some	1
fine	1
fresh	1
yeast,	1
she	1
thanked	1
him,	1
but	1
sighed,	1
and	1
said	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
of	1
no	1
use	1
to	1
her.	1
Accordingly	1
she	1
went	1
to	1
work	1
with	1
much	1
prudent	1
care,	1
and	1
when	1
her	1
bread	1
the	1
next	1
morning	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
oven,	1
it	1
was	1
excellent;	1
at	1
least	1
her	1
mother	1
said	1
so,	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
good	1
judge.	1
It	1
was	1
sent	1
to	1
the	1
Abbey;	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
family	1
there	1
had	1
not	1
tasted	1
any	1
good	1
bread	1
since	1
their	1
arrival	1
in	1
the	1
country,	1
they	1
also	1
were	1
earnest	1
and	1
warm	1
in	1
its	1
praise.	1
Inquiries	1
were	1
made	1
from	1
the	1
housekeeper,	1
and	1
they	1
heard,	1
with	1
some	1
surprise,	1
that	1
this	1
excellent	1
bread	1
was	1
made	1
by	1
a	1
young	1
girl	1
only	1
twelve	1
years	1
old.	1
The	1
housekeeper,	1
who	1
had	1
known	1
Susan	1
from	1
a	1
child,	1
was	1
pleased	1
to	1
have	1
an	1
opportunity	1
in	1
speaking	1
in	1
her	1
favour.	1
"She	1
is	1
the	1
most	1
industrious	1
little	1
creature,	1
ma'am,	1
in	1
the	1
world,"	1
said	1
she	1
to	1
her	1
mistress.	1
"Little	1
I	1
can't	1
so	1
well	1
call	1
her	1
now,	1
since	1
she's	1
grown	1
tall	1
and	1
slender	1
to	1
look	1
at;	1
and	1
glad	1
I	1
am	1
she	1
is	1
grown	1
up	1
likely	1
to	1
look	1
at;	1
for	1
handsome	1
is	1
that	1
handsome	1
does;	1
she	1
thinks	1
no	1
more	1
of	1
her	1
being	1
handsome	1
than	1
I	1
do	1
myself;	1
yet	1
she	1
has	1
as	1
proper	1
a	1
respect	1
for	1
herself,	1
ma'am,	1
as	1
you	1
have;	1
and	1
I	1
always	1
see	1
her	1
neat,	1
and	1
with	1
her	1
mother,	1
ma'am,	1
or	1
fit	1
people,	1
as	1
a	1
girl	1
should	1
be.	1
As	1
for	1
her	1
mother,	1
she	1
dotes	1
upon	1
her,	1
as	1
well	1
she	1
may;	1
for	1
I	1
should	1
myself	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
half	1
such	1
a	1
daughter;	1
and	1
then	1
she	1
has	1
two	1
little	1
brothers;	1
and	1
she's	1
as	1
good	1
to	1
them,	1
and,	1
my	1
boy	1
Philip	1
says,	1
taught	1
'em	1
to	1
read	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
school-mistress,	1
all	1
with	1
tenderness	1
and	1
good	1
nature;	1
but,	1
I	1
beg	1
your	1
pardon,	1
ma'am,	1
I	1
cannot	1
stop	1
myself	1
when	1
I	1
once	1
begin	1
to	1
talk	1
of	1
Susan."	1
"You	1
have	1
really	1
said	1
enough	1
to	1
excite	1
my	1
curiosity,"	1
said	1
her	1
mistress;	1
"pray	1
send	1
for	1
her	1
immediately;	1
we	1
can	1
see	1
her	1
before	1
we	1
go	1
out	1
to	1
walk."	1
The	1
benevolent	1
housekeeper	1
despatched	1
her	1
boy	1
Philip	1
for	1
Susan,	1
who	1
never	1
happened	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
such	1
an	1
UNTIDY	1
state	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
unable	1
to	1
obey	1
a	1
summons	1
without	1
a	1
long	1
preparation.	1
She	1
had,	1
it	1
is	1
true,	1
been	1
very	1
busy;	1
but	1
orderly	1
people	1
can	1
be	1
busy	1
and	1
neat	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time.	1
She	1
put	1
on	1
her	1
usual	1
straw	1
hat,	1
and	1
accompanied	1
Rose's	1
mother,	1
who	1
was	1
going	1
with	1
a	1
basket	1
of	1
cleared	1
muslin	1
to	1
the	1
Abbey.	1
The	1
modest	1
simplicity	1
of	1
Susan's	1
appearance	1
and	1
the	1
artless	1
propriety	1
of	1
the	1
answers	1
she	1
gave	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
questions	1
that	1
were	1
asked	1
her,	1
pleased	1
the	1
ladies	1
at	1
the	1
Abbey,	1
who	1
were	1
good	1
judges	1
of	1
character	1
and	1
manners.	1
Sir	1
Arthur	1
Somers	1
had	1
two	1
sisters,	1
sensible,	1
benevolent	1
women.	1
They	1
were	1
not	1
of	1
that	1
race	1
of	1
fine	1
ladies	1
who	1
are	1
miserable	1
the	1
moment	1
they	1
come	1
to	1
THE	1
COUNTRY;	1
nor	1
yet	1
were	1
they	1
of	1
that	1
bustling	1
sort,	1
who	1
quack	1
and	1
direct	1
all	1
their	1
poor	1
neighbours,	1
for	1
the	1
mere	1
love	1
of	1
managing,	1
or	1
the	1
want	1
of	1
something	1
to	1
do.	1
They	1
were	1
judiciously	1
generous;	1
and	1
whilst	1
they	1
wished	1
to	1
diffuse	1
happiness,	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
peremptory	1
in	1
requiring	1
that	1
people	1
should	1
be	1
happy	1
precisely	1
their	1
own	1
way.	1
With	1
these	1
dispositions,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
well	1
informed	1
brother,	1
who,	1
though	1
he	1
never	1
wished	1
to	1
direct,	1
was	1
always	1
willing	1
to	1
assist	1
in	1
their	1
efforts	1
to	1
do	1
good,	1
there	1
were	1
reasonable	1
hopes	1
that	1
these	1
ladies	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
blessing	1
to	1
the	1
poor	1
villagers	1
amongst	1
whom	1
they	1
were	1
now	1
settled.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
Miss	1
Somers	1
had	1
spoken	1
to	1
Susan,	1
she	1
inquired	1
for	1
her	1
brother;	1
but	1
Sir	1
Arthur	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
study,	1
and	1
a	1
gentleman	1
was	1
with	1
him	1
on	1
business.	1
Susan	1
was	1
desirous	1
of	1
returning	1
to	1
her	1
mother,	1
and	1
the	1
ladies	1
therefore	1
would	1
not	1
detain	1
her.	1
Miss	1
Somers	1
told	1
her,	1
with	1
a	1
smile,	1
when	1
she	1
took	1
leave,	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
call	1
upon	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
at	1
six	1
o'clock.	1
It	1
was	1
impossible	1
that	1
such	1
a	1
grand	1
event	1
as	1
Susan's	1
visit	1
to	1
the	1
Abbey	1
could	1
long	1
remain	1
unknown	1
to	1
Barbara	1
Case	1
and	1
her	1
gossiping	1
maid.	1
They	1
watched	1
eagerly	1
for	1
the	1
moment	1
of	1
her	1
return,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
satisfy	1
their	1
curiosity.	1
"There	1
she	1
is,	1
I	1
declare,	1
just	1
come	1
into	1
her	1
garden,"	1
cried	1
Bab;	1
"I'll	1
run	1
in	1
and	1
get	1
it	1
all	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
in	1
a	1
minute."	1
Bab	1
could	1
descend,	1
without	1
shame,	1
whenever	1
it	1
suited	1
her	1
purposes,	1
from	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
insolent	1
pride	1
to	1
the	1
lowest	1
meanness	1
of	1
fawning	1
familiarity.	1
Susan	1
was	1
gathering	1
some	1
marigolds	1
and	1
some	1
parsley	1
for	1
her	1
mother's	1
broth.	1
"So,	1
Susan,"	1
said	1
Bab,	1
who	1
came	1
close	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
before	1
she	1
perceived	1
it,	1
"how	1
goes	1
the	1
world	1
with	1
you	1
to-day?"	1
"My	1
mother	1
is	1
rather	1
better	1
to-day,	1
she	1
says,	1
ma'am--thank	1
you,"	1
replies	1
Susan,	1
coldly	1
but	1
civilly.	1
"MA'AM!	1
dear,	1
how	1
polite	1
we	1
are	1
grown	1
of	1
a	1
sudden!"	1
cried	1
Bab,	1
winking	1
at	1
her	1
maid.	1
"One	1
may	1
see	1
you've	1
been	1
in	1
good	1
company	1
this	1
morning--hey,	1
Susan?	1
Come,	1
let's	1
hear	1
about	1
it."	1
"Did	1
you	1
see	1
the	1
ladies	1
themselves,	1
or	1
was	1
it	1
only	1
the	1
housekeeper	1
sent	1
for	1
you?"	1
said	1
the	1
maid.	1
"What	1
room	1
did	1
you	1
go	1
into?"	1
continued	1
Bab.	1
"Did	1
you	1
see	1
Miss	1
Somers,	1
or	1
Sir	1
Arthur?"	1
"Miss	1
Somers."	1
"La!	1
she	1
saw	1
Miss	1
Somers!	1
Betty,	1
I	1
must	1
hear	1
about	1
it.	1
Can't	1
you	1
stop	1
gathering	1
those	1
things	1
for	1
a	1
minute,	1
and	1
chat	1
a	1
bit	1
with	1
us,	1
Susan?"	1
"I	1
can't	1
stay,	1
indeed,	1
Miss	1
Barbara;	1
for	1
my	1
mother's	1
broth	1
is	1
just	1
wanted,	1
and	1
I'm	1
in	1
a	1
hurry."	1
Susan	1
ran	1
home.	1
"Lord,	1
her	1
head	1
is	1
full	1
of	1
broth	1
now,"	1
said	1
Bab	1
to	1
her	1
maid;	1
"and	1
she	1
has	1
not	1
a	1
word	1
for	1
herself,	1
though	1
she	1
has	1
been	1
abroad.	1
My	1
papa	1
may	1
well	1
call	1
her	1
Simple	1
Susan;	1
for	1
simple	1
she	1
is,	1
and	1
simple	1
she	1
will	1
be,	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
over.	1
For	1
my	1
part,	1
I	1
think	1
she's	1
little	1
better	1
than	1
a	1
downright	1
simpleton.	1
But,	1
however,	1
simple	1
or	1
not,	1
I'll	1
get	1
what	1
I	1
want	1
out	1
of	1
her.	1
She'll	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
speak,	1
maybe,	1
when	1
she	1
has	1
settled	1
the	1
grand	1
matter	1
of	1
the	1
broth.	1
I'll	1
step	1
in	1
and	1
ask	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
mother,	1
that	1
will	1
put	1
her	1
in	1
a	1
good	1
humour	1
in	1
a	1
trice."	1
Barbara	1
followed	1
Susan	1
into	1
the	1
cottage,	1
and	1
found	1
her	1
occupied	1
with	1
the	1
grand	1
affair	1
of	1
the	1
broth.	1
"Is	1
it	1
ready?"	1
said	1
Bab,	1
peeping	1
into	1
the	1
pot	1
that	1
was	1
over	1
the	1
fire.	1
"Dear,	1
how	1
savoury	1
it	1
smells!	1
I'll	1
wait	1
till	1
you	1
go	1
in	1
with	1
it	1
to	1
your	1
mother;	1
for	1
I	1
must	1
ask	1
her	1
how	1
she	1
does	1
myself."	1
"Will	1
you	1
please	1
to	1
sit	1
down	1
then,	1
miss,"	1
said	1
Simple	1
Susan,	1
with	1
a	1
smile;	1
for	1
at	1
this	1
instant	1
she	1
forgot	1
the	1
guinea-hen;	1
"I	1
have	1
but	1
just	1
put	1
the	1
parsley	1
into	1
the	1
broth;	1
but	1
it	1
soon	1
will	1
be	1
ready."	1
During	1
this	1
interval	1
Bab	1
employed	1
herself,	1
much	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
satisfaction,	1
in	1
cross-questioning	1
Susan.	1
She	1
was	1
rather	1
provoked	1
indeed	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
learn	1
exactly	1
how	1
each	1
of	1
the	1
ladies	1
was	1
dressed,	1
and	1
what	1
there	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
for	1
dinner	1
at	1
the	1
Abbey;	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
curious	1
beyond	1
measure	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
what	1
Miss	1
Somers	1
meant,	1
by	1
saying	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
call	1
at	1
Mr.	1
Price's	1
cottage	1
at	1
six	1
o'clock	1
in	1
the	1
evening.	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
she	1
could	1
mean?"	1
"I	1
thought	1
she	1
meant	1
what	1
she	1
said,"	1
replied	1
Susan,	1
"that	1
she	1
would	1
come	1
here	1
at	1
six	1
o'clock."	1
"Ay,	1
that's	1
as	1
plain	1
as	1
a	1
pike-staff,"	1
said	1
Barbara;	1
"but	1
what	1
else	1
did	1
she	1
mean,	1
think	1
you?	1
People,	1
you	1
know,	1
don't	1
always	1
mean	1
exactly,	1
downright,	1
neither	1
more	1
nor	1
less	1
than	1
what	1
they	1
say."	1
"Not	1
always,"	1
said	1
Susan,	1
with	1
an	1
arch	1
smile,	1
which	1
convinced	1
Barbara	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
quite	1
a	1
simpleton.	1
"NOT	1
ALWAYS,"	1
repeated	1
Barbara	1
colouring,--"oh,	1
then	1
I	1
suppose	1
you	1
have	1
some	1
guess	1
at	1
what	1
Miss	1
Somers	1
meant."	1
"No,"	1
said	1
Susan,	1
"I	1
was	1
not	1
thinking	1
about	1
Miss	1
Somers,	1
when	1
I	1
said	1
not	1
always."	1
"How	1
nice	1
that	1
broth	1
does	1
look,"	1
resumed	1
Barbara,	1
after	1
a	1
pause.	1
Susan	1
had	1
now	1
poured	1
the	1
broth	1
into	1
a	1
basin,	1
and	1
as	1
she	1
strewed	1
over	1
it	1
the	1
bright	1
orange	1
marigolds,	1
it	1
looked	1
very	1
tempting.	1
She	1
tasted	1
it,	1
and	1
added	1
now	1
a	1
little	1
salt,	1
and	1
now	1
a	1
little	1
more,	1
till	1
she	1
thought	1
it	1
was	1
just	1
to	1
her	1
mother's	1
taste.	1
"Oh!	1
_I_	1
must	1
taste	1
it,"	1
said	1
Bab,	1
taking	1
the	1
basin	1
up	1
greedily.	1
"Won't	1
you	1
take	1
a	1
spoon?"	1
said	1
Susan,	1
trembling	1
at	1
the	1
large	1
mouthfuls	1
which	1
Barbara	1
sucked	1
up	1
with	1
a	1
terrible	1
noise.	1
"Take	1
a	1
spoonful,	1
indeed!"	1
exclaimed	1
Barbara,	1
setting	1
down	1
the	1
basin	1
in	1
high	1
anger.	1
"The	1
next	1
time	1
I	1
taste	1
your	1
broth	1
you	1
shall	1
affront	1
me,	1
if	1
you	1
dare!	1
The	1
next	1
time	1
I	1
set	1
my	1
foot	1
in	1
this	1
house,	1
you	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
saucy	1
to	1
me	1
as	1
you	1
please."	1
And	1
she	1
flounced	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
repeating	1
"TAKE	1
A	1
SPOON,	1
PIG,	1
was	1
what	1
you	1
meant	1
to	1
say."	1
Susan	1
stood	1
in	1
amazement	1
at	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
this	1
speech;	1
but	1
the	1
concluding	1
words	1
explained	1
to	1
her	1
the	1
mystery.	1
Some	1
years	1
before	1
this	1
time,	1
when	1
Susan	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
little	1
girl,	1
and	1
could	1
scarcely	1
speak	1
plain,	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
eating	1
a	1
basin	1
of	1
bread	1
and	1
milk	1
for	1
her	1
supper	1
at	1
the	1
cottage	1
door,	1
a	1
great	1
pig	1
came	1
up,	1
and	1
put	1
his	1
nose	1
into	1
the	1
basin.	1
Susan	1
was	1
willing	1
that	1
the	1
pig	1
should	1
have	1
some	1
share	1
of	1
the	1
bread	1
and	1
milk;	1
but	1
as	1
she	1
ate	1
with	1
a	1
spoon	1
and	1
he	1
with	1
his	1
large	1
mouth,	1
she	1
presently	1
discovered	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
likely	1
to	1
have	1
more	1
than	1
his	1
share;	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
simple	1
tone	1
of	1
expostulation	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
"Take	1
a	1
POON,	1
pig."*	1
The	1
saying	1
become	1
proverbial	1
in	1
the	1
village.	1
Susan's	1
little	1
companions	1
repeated	1
it,	1
and	1
applied	1
it	1
upon	1
many	1
occasions,	1
whenever	1
anyone	1
claimed	1
more	1
than	1
his	1
share	1
of	1
anything	1
good.	1
Barbara,	1
who	1
was	1
then	1
not	1
Miss	1
Barbara,	1
but	1
plain	1
Bab,	1
and	1
who	1
had	1
played	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
poor	1
children	1
in	1
the	1
neighbourhood,	1
was	1
often	1
reproved	1
in	1
her	1
unjust	1
methods	1
of	1
division	1
by	1
Susan's	1
proverb.	1
Susan,	1
as	1
she	1
grew	1
up,	1
forgot	1
the	1
childish	1
saying;	1
but	1
the	1
remembrance	1
of	1
it	1
rankled	1
in	1
Barbara's	1
mind,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
this	1
that	1
she	1
suspected	1
Susan	1
had	1
alluded,	1
when	1
she	1
recommended	1
a	1
spoon	1
to	1
her,	1
whilst	1
she	1
was	1
swallowing	1
the	1
basin	1
of	1
broth.	1
*This	1
is	1
a	1
true	1
anecdote.	1
"La,	1
miss,"	1
said	1
Barbara's	1
maid,	1
when	1
she	1
found	1
her	1
mistress	1
in	1
a	1
passion	1
upon	1
her	1
return	1
from	1
Susan's,	1
"I	1
only	1
wondered	1
you	1
did	1
her	1
the	1
honour	1
to	1
set	1
your	1
foot	1
within	1
her	1
doors.	1
What	1
need	1
have	1
you	1
to	1
trouble	1
her	1
for	1
news	1
about	1
the	1
Abbey	1
folks,	1
when	1
your	1
own	1
papa	1
has	1
been	1
there	1
all	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
is	1
just	1
come	1
in,	1
and	1
can	1
tell	1
you	1
everything?"	1
Barbara	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
that	1
her	1
father	1
meant	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
Abbey	1
that	1
morning,	1
for	1
Attorney	1
Case	1
was	1
mysterious	1
even	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
family	1
about	1
his	1
morning	1
rides.	1
He	1
never	1
chose	1
to	1
be	1
asked	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
going,	1
or	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
been;	1
and	1
this	1
made	1
his	1
servants	1
more	1
than	1
commonly	1
inquisitive	1
to	1
trace	1
him.	1
Barbara,	1
against	1
whose	1
apparent	1
childishness	1
and	1
real	1
cunning	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
sufficiently	1
on	1
his	1
guard,	1
had	1
often	1
the	1
art	1
of	1
drawing	1
him	1
into	1
conversation	1
about	1
his	1
visits.	1
She	1
ran	1
into	1
her	1
father's	1
parlour;	1
but	1
she	1
knew,	1
the	1
moment	1
she	1
saw	1
his	1
face,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
no	1
time	1
to	1
ask	1
questions;	1
his	1
pen	1
was	1
across	1
his	1
mouth,	1
and	1
his	1
brown	1
wig	1
pushed	1
oblique	1
upon	1
his	1
contracted	1
forehead.	1
The	1
wig	1
was	1
always	1
pushed	1
crooked	1
whenever	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
brown	1
or	1
rather,	1
a	1
black	1
study.	1
Barbara,	1
who	1
did	1
not,	1
like	1
Susan,	1
bear	1
with	1
her	1
father's	1
testy	1
humour	1
from	1
affection	1
and	1
gentleness	1
of	1
disposition,	1
but	1
who	1
always	1
humoured	1
him	1
from	1
artifice,	1
tried	1
all	1
her	1
skill	1
to	1
fathom	1
his	1
thoughts,	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
found	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
do,	1
she	1
went	1
to	1
tell	1
her	1
maid	1
so,	1
and	1
to	1
complain	1
that	1
her	1
father	1
was	1
so	1
cross	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
bearing	1
him.	1
It	1
is	1
true	1
that	1
Attorney	1
Case	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
happiest	1
mood	1
possible;	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
satisfied	1
with	1
his	1
morning's	1
work	1
at	1
the	1
Abbey.	1
Sir	1
Arthur	1
Somers,	1
the	1
NEW	1
MAN,	1
did	1
not	1
suit	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
rather	1
apprehensive	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
not	1
suit	1
Sir	1
Arthur.	1
He	1
had	1
sound	1
reasons	1
for	1
his	1
doubts.	1
Sir	1
Arthur	1
Somers	1
was	1
an	1
excellent	1
lawyer,	1
and	1
a	1
perfectly	1
honest	1
man.	1
This	1
seemed	1
to	1
our	1
attorney	1
a	1
contradiction	1
in	1
terms;	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
his	1
practice	1
the	1
case	1
had	1
not	1
occurred;	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
precedents	1
ready	1
to	1
direct	1
his	1
proceedings.	1
Sir	1
Arthur	1
was	1
also	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
wit	1
and	1
eloquence,	1
yet	1
of	1
plain	1
dealing	1
and	1
humanity.	1
The	1
attorney	1
could	1
not	1
persuade	1
himself	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
his	1
benevolence	1
was	1
anything	1
but	1
enlightened	1
cunning,	1
and	1
his	1
plain	1
dealing	1
he	1
one	1
minute	1
dreaded	1
as	1
the	1
masterpiece	1
of	1
art,	1
and	1
the	1
next	1
despised	1
as	1
the	1
characteristic	1
of	1
folly.	1
In	1
short,	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
decided	1
whether	1
he	1
was	1
an	1
honest	1
man	1
or	1
a	1
knave.	1
He	1
had	1
settled	1
accounts	1
with	1
him	1
for	1
his	1
late	1
agency,	1
and	1
had	1
talked	1
about	1
sundry	1
matters	1
of	1
business.	1
He	1
constantly	1
perceived,	1
however,	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
impose	1
upon	1
Sir	1
Arthur;	1
but	1
the	1
idea	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
know	1
all	1
the	1
mazes	1
of	1
the	1
law,	1
and	1
yet	1
prefer	1
the	1
straight	1
road,	1
was	1
incomprehensible.	1
Mr.	1
Case,	1
having	1
paid	1
Sir	1
Arthur	1
some	1
compliments	1
on	1
his	1
great	1
legal	1
abilities,	1
and	1
his	1
high	1
reputation	1
at	1
the	1
bar,	1
he	1
coolly	1
replied,	1
"I	1
have	1
left	1
the	1
bar."	1
The	1
attorney	1
looked	1
in	1
unfeigned	1
astonishment,	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
was	1
actually	1
making	1
3,OOO	1
pounds	1
per	1
annum	1
at	1
the	1
bar	1
should	1
leave	1
it.	1
"I	1
am	1
come,"	1
said	1
Sir	1
Arthur,	1
"to	1
enjoy	1
that	1
kind	1
of	1
domestic	1
life	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
which	1
I	1
prefer	1
to	1
all	1
others,	1
and	1
amongst	1
people	1
whose	1
happiness	1
I	1
hope	1
to	1
increase."	1
At	1
this	1
speech	1
the	1
attorney	1
changed	1
his	1
ground,	1
flattering	1
himself	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
find	1
his	1
man	1
averse	1
to	1
business,	1
and	1
ignorant	1
of	1
country	1
affairs.	1
He	1
talked	1
of	1
the	1
value	1
of	1
land,	1
and	1
of	1
new	1
leases.	1
Sir	1
Arthur	1
wished	1
to	1
enlarge	1
his	1
domain,	1
and	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
ride	1
round	1
it.	1
A	1
map	1
of	1
it	1
was	1
lying	1
upon	1
the	1
table,	1
and	1
Farmer	1
Price's	1
garden	1
came	1
exactly	1
across	1
the	1
new	1
road	1
for	1
the	1
ride.	1
Sir	1
Arthur	1
looked	1
disappointed;	1
and	1
the	1
keen	1
attorney	1
seized	1
the	1
moment	1
to	1
inform	1
him	1
that	1
"Price's	1
whole	1
land	1
was	1
at	1
his	1
disposal."	1
"At	1
my	1
disposal!	1
how	1
so?"	1
cried	1
Sir	1
Arthur,	1
eagerly;	1
"it	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
out	1
of	1
lease,	1
I	1
believe,	1
these	1
ten	1
years.	1
I'll	1
look	1
into	1
the	1
rent	1
roll	1
again;	1
perhaps	1
I	1
am	1
mistaken."	1
"You	1
are	1
mistaken,	1
my	1
good	1
sir,	1
and	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
mistaken,"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Case,	1
with	1
a	1
shrewd	1
smile.	1
"In	1
one	1
sense,	1
the	1
land	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
out	1
of	1
lease	1
these	1
ten	1
years,	1
and	1
in	1
another	1
it	1
is	1
out	1
of	1
lease	1
at	1
this	1
present	1
time.	1
To	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
point	1
at	1
once,	1
the	1
lease	1
is,	1
ab	1
origine,	1
null	1
and	1
void.	1
I	1
have	1
detected	1
a	1
capital	1
flaw	1
in	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
it.	1
I	1
pledge	1
my	1
credit	1
upon	1
it,	1
sir,	1
it	1
can't	1
stand	1
a	1
single	1
term	1
in	1
law	1
or	1
equity."	1
The	1
attorney	1
observed,	1
that	1
at	1
these	1
words	1
Sir	1
Arthur's	1
eye	1
was	1
fixed	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
earnest	1
attention.	1
"Now	1
I	1
have	1
him,"	1
said	1
the	1
cunning	1
tempter	1
to	1
himself.	1
"Neither	1
in	1
law	1
nor	1
equity,"	1
repeated	1
Sir	1
Arthur,	1
with	1
apparent	1
incredulity.	1
"Are	1
you	1
sure	1
of	1
that,	1
Mr.	1
Case?"	1
"Sure!	1
As	1
I	1
told	1
you	1
before,	1
sir,	1
I'd	1
pledge	1
my	1
whole	1
credit	1
upon	1
the	1
thing--I'd	1
stake	1
my	1
existence."	1
"THAT'S	1
SOMETHING,"	1
said	1
Sir	1
Arthur,	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
was	1
pondering	1
upon	1
the	1
matter.	1
The	1
attorney	1
went	1
on	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
eagerness	1
of	1
a	1
keen	1
man,	1
who	1
sees	1
a	1
chance	1
at	1
one	1
stroke	1
of	1
winning	1
a	1
rich	1
friend,	1
and	1
of	1
ruining	1
a	1
poor	1
enemy.	1
He	1
explained,	1
with	1
legal	1
volubility	1
and	1
technical	1
amplification,	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
mistake	1
in	1
Mr.	1
Price's	1
lease.	1
"It	1
was,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"a	1
lease	1
for	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
Peter	1
Price,	1
Susanna	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
survivor	1
or	1
survivors	1
of	1
them,	1
or	1
for	1
the	1
full	1
time	1
and	1
term	1
of	1
twenty	1
years,	1
to	1
be	1
computed	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
of	1
May	1
then	1
next	1
ensuing.	1
Now,	1
sir,	1
this,	1
you	1
see,	1
is	1
a	1
lease	1
in	1
reversion,	1
which	1
the	1
late	1
Sir	1
Benjamin	1
Somers	1
had	1
not,	1
by	1
his	1
settlement,	1
a	1
right	1
to	1
make.	1
This	1
is	1
a	1
curious	1
mistake,	1
you	1
see,	1
Sir	1
Arthur;	1
and	1
in	1
filling	1
up	1
those	1
printed	1
leases	1
there's	1
always	1
a	1
good	1
chance	1
of	1
some	1
flaw.	1
I	1
find	1
it	1
perpetually;	1
but	1
I	1
never	1
found	1
a	1
better	1
than	1
this	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
course	1
of	1
my	1
practice."	1
Sir	1
Arthur	1
stood	1
in	1
silence.	1
"My	1
dear	1
sir,"	1
said	1
the	1
attorney,	1
taking	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
button,	1
"you	1
have	1
no	1
scruple	1
of	1
stirring	1
in	1
this	1
business?"	1
"A	1
little,"	1
said	1
Sir	1
Arthur.	1
"Why,	1
then,	1
that	1
can	1
be	1
done	1
away	1
in	1
a	1
moment.	1
Your	1
name	1
shall	1
not	1
appear	1
in	1
it	1
at	1
all.	1
You	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
but	1
to	1
make	1
over	1
the	1
lease	1
to	1
me.	1
I	1
make	1
all	1
safe	1
to	1
you	1
with	1
my	1
bond.	1
Now,	1
being	1
in	1
possession,	1
I	1
come	1
forward	1
in	1
my	1
own	1
proper	1
person.	1
SHALL	1
I	1
PROCEED?"	1
"No--you	1
have	1
said	1
enough,"	1
replied	1
Sir	1
Arthur.	1
"The	1
case,	1
indeed,	1
lies	1
in	1
a	1
nutshell,"	1
said	1
the	1
attorney,	1
who	1
had	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
worked	1
himself	1
up	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
pitch	1
of	1
professional	1
enthusiasm,	1
that,	1
intent	1
upon	1
his	1
vision	1
of	1
a	1
lawsuit,	1
he	1
totally	1
forgot	1
to	1
observe	1
the	1
impression	1
his	1
words	1
made	1
upon	1
Sir	1
Arthur.	1
"There's	1
only	1
one	1
thing	1
we	1
have	1
forgotten	1
all	1
this	1
time,"	1
said	1
Sir	1
Arthur.	1
"What	1
can	1
that	1
be,	1
sir?"	1
"That	1
we	1
shall	1
ruin	1
this	1
poor	1
man."	1
Case	1
was	1
thunderstruck	1
at	1
these	1
words,	1
or	1
rather,	1
by	1
the	1
look	1
which	1
accompanied	1
them.	1
He	1
recollected	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
laid	1
himself	1
open	1
before	1
he	1
was	1
sure	1
of	1
Sir	1
Arthur's	1
REAL	1
character.	1
He	1
softened,	1
and	1
said	1
he	1
should	1
have	1
had	1
certainly	1
more	1
CONSIDERATION	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
any	1
but	1
a	1
litigious,	1
pig-headed	1
fellow,	1
as	1
he	1
knew	1
Price	1
to	1
be.	1
"If	1
he	1
be	1
litigious,"	1
said	1
Sir	1
Arthur,	1
"I	1
shall	1
certainly	1
be	1
glad	1
to	1
get	1
him	1
fairly	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
parish	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
possible.	1
When	1
you	1
go	1
home,	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
so	1
good,	1
sir,	1
as	1
to	1
send	1
me	1
his	1
lease,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
satisfy	1
myself	1
before	1
we	1
stir	1
in	1
this	1
business."	1
The	1
attorney,	1
brightening	1
up,	1
prepared	1
to	1
take	1
leave;	1
but	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
persuade	1
himself	1
to	1
take	1
his	1
departure	1
without	1
making	1
one	1
push	1
at	1
Sir	1
Arthur	1
about	1
the	1
agency.	1
"I	1
will	1
not	1
trouble	1
you,	1
Sir	1
Arthur,	1
with	1
this	1
lease	1
of	1
Price's,"	1
said	1
Case;	1
"I'll	1
leave	1
it	1
with	1
your	1
agent.	1
Whom	1
shall	1
I	1
apply	1
to?"	1
"TO	1
MYSELF,	1
sir,	1
if	1
you	1
please,"	1
replied	1
Sir	1
Arthur.	1
The	1
courtiers	1
of	1
Louis	1
the	1
Fourteenth	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
looked	1
more	1
astounded	1
than	1
our	1
attorney,	1
when	1
they	1
received	1
from	1
their	1
monarch	1
a	1
similar	1
answer.	1
It	1
was	1
this	1
unexpected	1
reply	1
of	1
Sir	1
Arthur's	1
which	1
had	1
deranged	1
the	1
temper	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Case,	1
and	1
caused	1
his	1
wig	1
to	1
stand	1
so	1
crooked	1
upon	1
his	1
forehead,	1
and	1
which	1
had	1
rendered	1
him	1
impenetrably	1
silent	1
to	1
his	1
inquisitive	1
daughter	1
Barbara.	1
After	1
having	1
walked	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
his	1
room,	1
conversing	1
with	1
himself,	1
for	1
some	1
time,	1
the	1
attorney	1
concluded	1
that	1
the	1
agency	1
must	1
be	1
given	1
to	1
somebody	1
when	1
Sir	1
Arthur	1
should	1
have	1
to	1
attend	1
his	1
duty	1
in	1
Parliament;	1
that	1
the	1
agency,	1
even	1
for	1
the	1
winter	1
season,	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
thing	1
to	1
be	1
neglected;	1
and	1
that,	1
if	1
he	1
managed	1
well,	1
he	1
might	1
yet	1
secure	1
it	1
for	1
himself.	1
He	1
had	1
often	1
found	1
that	1
small	1
timely	1
presents	1
worked	1
wonderfully	1
upon	1
his	1
own	1
mind,	1
and	1
he	1
judged	1
of	1
others	1
by	1
himself.	1
The	1
tenants	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
reluctant	1
but	1
constant	1
practice	1
of	1
making	1
him	1
continual	1
petty	1
offerings;	1
and	1
he	1
resolved	1
to	1
try	1
the	1
same	1
course	1
with	1
Sir	1
Arthur,	1
whose	1
resolution	1
to	1
be	1
his	1
own	1
agent,	1
he	1
thought,	1
argued	1
a	1
close,	1
saving,	1
avaricious	1
disposition.	1
He	1
had	1
heard	1
the	1
housekeeper	1
at	1
the	1
Abbey	1
inquiring,	1
as	1
he	1
passed	1
through	1
the	1
servants,	1
whether	1
there	1
was	1
any	1
lamb	1
to	1
be	1
gotten?	1
She	1
said	1
that	1
Sir	1
Arthur	1
was	1
remarkably	1
fond	1
of	1
lamb,	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
wished	1
she	1
could	1
get	1
a	1
quarter	1
for	1
him.	1
Immediately	1
he	1
sallied	1
into	1
his	1
kitchen,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
idea	1
struck	1
him,	1
and	1
asked	1
a	1
shepherd,	1
who	1
was	1
waiting	1
there,	1
whether	1
he	1
knew	1
of	1
a	1
nice	1
fat	1
lamb	1
to	1
be	1
had	1
anywhere	1
in	1
the	1
neighbourhood.	1
"I	1
know	1
of	1
one,"	1
cried	1
Barbara.	1
"Susan	1
Price	1
has	1
a	1
pet	1
lamb	1
that's	1
as	1
fat	1
as	1
fat	1
could	1
be."	1
The	1
attorney	1
easily	1
caught	1
at	1
these	1
words,	1
and	1
speedily	1
devised	1
a	1
scheme	1
for	1
obtaining	1
Susan's	1
lamb	1
for	1
nothing.	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
something	1
strange	1
if	1
an	1
attorney	1
of	1
his	1
talents	1
and	1
standing	1
was	1
not	1
an	1
over-match	1
for	1
Simple	1
Susan.	1
He	1
prowled	1
forth	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
his	1
prey.	1
He	1
found	1
Susan	1
packing	1
up	1
her	1
father's	1
little	1
wardrobe;	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
looked	1
up	1
as	1
she	1
knelt,	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
tears.	1
"How	1
is	1
your	1
mother	1
to-day,	1
Susan?"	1
inquired	1
the	1
attorney.	1
"Worse,	1
sir.	1
My	1
father	1
goes	1
to-morrow."	1
"That's	1
a	1
pity."	1
"It	1
can't	1
be	1
helped,"	1
said	1
Susan,	1
with	1
a	1
sigh.	1
"It	1
can't	1
be	1
helped--how	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
that?"	1
said	1
Case.	1
"Sir,	1
DEAR	1
sir!"	1
cried	1
she,	1
looking	1
up	1
at	1
him,	1
and	1
a	1
sudden	1
ray	1
of	1
hope	1
beamed	1
in	1
her	1
ingenuous	1
countenance.	1
"And	1
if	1
YOU	1
could	1
help	1
it,	1
Susan?"	1
said	1
he.	1
Susan	1
clasped	1
her	1
hands	1
in	1
silence,	1
more	1
expressive	1
than	1
words.	1
"You	1
CAN	1
help	1
it,	1
Susan."	1
She	1
started	1
up	1
in	1
an	1
ecstasy.	1
"What	1
would	1
you	1
give	1
now	1
to	1
have	1
your	1
father	1
at	1
home	1
for	1
a	1
whole	1
week	1
longer?"	1
"Anything!--but	1
I	1
have	1
nothing."	1
"Yes,	1
but	1
you	1
have,	1
a	1
lamb,"	1
said	1
the	1
hard-hearted	1
attorney.	1
"My	1
poor	1
little	1
lamb!"	1
said	1
Susan;	1
"but	1
what	1
can	1
that	1
do?"	1
"What	1
good	1
can	1
any	1
lamb	1
do?	1
Is	1
not	1
lamb	1
good	1
to	1
eat?	1
Why	1
do	1
you	1
look	1
so	1
pale,	1
girl?	1
Are	1
not	1
sheep	1
killed	1
every	1
day,	1
and	1
don't	1
you	1
eat	1
mutton?	1
Is	1
your	1
lamb	1
better	1
than	1
anybody	1
else's,	1
think	1
you?"	1
"I	1
don't	1
know,"	1
said	1
Susan,	1
"but	1
I	1
love	1
it	1
better."	1
"More	1
fool	1
you,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"It	1
feeds	1
out	1
of	1
hand,	1
it	1
follows	1
me	1
about;	1
I	1
have	1
always	1
taken	1
care	1
of	1
it;	1
my	1
mother	1
gave	1
it	1
to	1
me."	1
"Well,	1
say	1
no	1
more	1
about	1
it,	1
then,"	1
he	1
cynically	1
observed;	1
"if	1
you	1
love	1
your	1
lamb	1
better	1
than	1
both	1
your	1
father	1
and	1
your	1
mother,	1
keep	1
it,	1
and	1
good	1
morning	1
to	1
you."	1
"Stay,	1
oh	1
stay!"	1
cried	1
Susan,	1
catching	1
the	1
skirt	1
of	1
his	1
coat	1
with	1
an	1
eager,	1
trembling	1
hand;--"a	1
whole	1
week,	1
did	1
you	1
say?	1
My	1
mother	1
may	1
get	1
better	1
in	1
that	1
time.	1
No,	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
love	1
my	1
lamb	1
half	1
so	1
well."	1
The	1
struggle	1
of	1
her	1
mind	1
ceased,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
placid	1
countenance	1
and	1
calm	1
voice,	1
"take	1
the	1
lamb,"	1
said	1
she.	1
"Where	1
is	1
it?"	1
said	1
the	1
attorney.	1
"Grazing	1
in	1
the	1
meadow,	1
by	1
the	1
river	1
side."	1
"It	1
must	1
be	1
brought	1
up	1
before	1
night-fall	1
for	1
the	1
butcher,	1
remember."	1
"I	1
shall	1
not	1
forget	1
it,"	1
said	1
Susan,	1
steadily.	1
As	1
soon,	1
however,	1
as	1
her	1
persecutor	1
turned	1
his	1
back	1
and	1
quitted	1
the	1
house,	1
Susan	1
sat	1
down,	1
and	1
hid	1
her	1
face	1
in	1
her	1
hands.	1
She	1
was	1
soon	1
aroused	1
by	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
her	1
mother's	1
feeble	1
voice,	1
who	1
was	1
calling	1
Susan	1
from	1
the	1
inner	1
room	1
where	1
she	1
lay.	1
Susan	1
went	1
in;	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
undraw	1
the	1
curtain	1
as	1
she	1
stood	1
beside	1
the	1
bed.	1
"Are	1
you	1
there,	1
love?	1
Undraw	1
the	1
curtain,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
see	1
you,	1
and	1
tell	1
me;--I	1
thought	1
I	1
heard	1
some	1
strange	1
voice	1
just	1
now	1
talking	1
to	1
my	1
child.	1
Something's	1
amiss,	1
Susan,"	1
said	1
her	1
mother,	1
raising	1
herself	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
able	1
in	1
the	1
bed,	1
to	1
examine	1
her	1
daughter's	1
countenance.	1
"Would	1
you	1
think	1
it	1
amiss,	1
then,	1
my	1
dear	1
mother,"	1
said	1
Susan,	1
stooping	1
to	1
kiss	1
her--"would	1
you	1
think	1
it	1
amiss,	1
if	1
my	1
father	1
was	1
to	1
stay	1
with	1
us	1
a	1
week	1
longer?"	1
"Susan!	1
you	1
don't	1
say	1
so?"	1
"He	1
is,	1
indeed,	1
a	1
whole	1
week;--but	1
how	1
burning	1
hot	1
your	1
hand	1
is	1
still."	1
"Are	1
you	1
sure	1
he	1
will	1
stay?"	1
inquired	1
her	1
mother.	1
"How	1
do	1
you	1
know?	1
Who	1
told	1
you	1
so?	1
Tell	1
me	1
all	1
quick."	1
"Attorney	1
Case	1
told	1
me	1
so;	1
he	1
can	1
get	1
him	1
a	1
week's	1
longer	1
leave	1
of	1
absence,	1
and	1
he	1
has	1
promised	1
he	1
will."	1
"God	1
bless	1
him	1
for	1
it,	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever!"	1
said	1
the	1
poor	1
woman,	1
joining	1
her	1
hands.	1
"May	1
the	1
blessing	1
of	1
heaven	1
be	1
with	1
him!"	1
Susan	1
closed	1
the	1
curtains,	1
and	1
was	1
silent.	1
She	1
COULD	1
NOT	1
SAY	1
AMEN.	1
She	1
was	1
called	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
at	1
this	1
moment,	1
for	1
a	1
messenger	1
was	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
Abbey	1
for	1
the	1
bread-bills.	1
It	1
was	1
she	1
who	1
always	1
made	1
out	1
the	1
bills,	1
for	1
though	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
a	1
great	1
number	1
of	1
lessons	1
from	1
the	1
writing-master,	1
she	1
had	1
taken	1
so	1
much	1
pains	1
to	1
learn	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
write	1
a	1
very	1
neat,	1
legible	1
hand,	1
and	1
she	1
found	1
this	1
very	1
useful.	1
She	1
was	1
not,	1
to	1
be	1
sure,	1
particularly	1
inclined	1
to	1
draw	1
out	1
a	1
long	1
bill	1
at	1
this	1
instant,	1
but	1
business	1
must	1
be	1
done.	1
She	1
set	1
to	1
work,	1
ruled	1
her	1
lines	1
for	1
the	1
pounds,	1
shillings	1
and	1
pence,	1
made	1
out	1
the	1
bill	1
for	1
the	1
Abbey,	1
and	1
despatched	1
the	1
impatient	1
messenger.	1
She	1
then	1
resolved	1
to	1
make	1
out	1
all	1
the	1
bills	1
for	1
the	1
neighbours,	1
who	1
had	1
many	1
of	1
them	1
taken	1
a	1
few	1
loaves	1
and	1
rolls	1
of	1
her	1
baking.	1
"I	1
had	1
better	1
get	1
all	1
my	1
business	1
finished,"	1
said	1
she	1
to	1
herself,	1
"before	1
I	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
meadow	1
to	1
take	1
leave	1
of	1
my	1
poor	1
lamb."	1
This	1
was	1
sooner	1
said	1
than	1
done,	1
for	1
she	1
found	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
a	1
great	1
number	1
of	1
bills	1
to	1
write,	1
and	1
the	1
slate	1
on	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
entered	1
the	1
account	1
was	1
not	1
immediately	1
to	1
be	1
found;	1
and	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
found	1
the	1
figures	1
were	1
almost	1
rubbed	1
out.	1
Barbara	1
had	1
sat	1
down	1
upon	1
it.	1
Susan	1
pored	1
over	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
loaves,	1
and	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
the	1
persons	1
who	1
took	1
them;	1
and	1
she	1
wrote	1
and	1
cast	1
up	1
sums,	1
and	1
corrected	1
and	1
re-corrected	1
them,	1
till	1
her	1
head	1
grew	1
quite	1
puzzled.	1
The	1
table	1
was	1
covered	1
with	1
little	1
square	1
bits	1
of	1
paper,	1
on	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
writing	1
bills	1
over	1
and	1
over	1
again,	1
when	1
her	1
father	1
came	1
in	1
with	1
a	1
bill	1
in	1
his	1
hand.	1
"How's	1
this,	1
Susan?"	1
said	1
he.	1
"How	1
can	1
ye	1
be	1
so	1
careless,	1
child?	1
What	1
is	1
your	1
head	1
running	1
upon?	1
Here,	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
bill	1
you	1
were	1
sending	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
Abbey?	1
I	1
met	1
the	1
messenger,	1
and	1
luckily	1
asked	1
to	1
see	1
how	1
much	1
it	1
was.	1
Look	1
at	1
it."	1
Susan	1
looked	1
and	1
blushed;	1
it	1
was	1
written,	1
"Sir	1
Arthur	1
Somers,	1
to	1
John	1
Price,	1
debtor,	1
six	1
dozen	1
LAMBS,	1
so	1
much."	1
She	1
altered	1
it,	1
and	1
returned	1
it	1
to	1
her	1
father;	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
up	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
papers	1
which	1
lay	1
upon	1
the	1
table.	1
"What	1
are	1
all	1
these,	1
child?"	1
"Some	1
of	1
them	1
are	1
wrong,	1
and	1
I've	1
written	1
them	1
out	1
again,"	1
said	1
Susan.	1
"Some	1
of	1
them!	1
All	1
of	1
them,	1
I	1
think,	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
wrong,	1
if	1
I	1
can	1
read,"	1
said	1
her	1
father,	1
rather	1
angrily,	1
and	1
he	1
pointed	1
out	1
to	1
her	1
sundry	1
strange	1
mistakes.	1
Her	1
head,	1
indeed,	1
had	1
been	1
running	1
upon	1
her	1
poor	1
lamb.	1
She	1
corrected	1
all	1
the	1
mistakes	1
with	1
so	1
much	1
patience,	1
and	1
bore	1
to	1
be	1
blamed	1
with	1
so	1
much	1
good	1
humour,	1
that	1
her	1
father	1
at	1
last	1
said,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
ever	1
to	1
scold	1
Susan,	1
without	1
being	1
in	1
the	1
wrong	1
at	1
the	1
last.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
all	1
was	1
set	1
right,	1
Price	1
took	1
the	1
bills,	1
and	1
said	1
he	1
would	1
go	1
round	1
to	1
the	1
neighbours,	1
and	1
collect	1
the	1
money	1
himself;	1
for	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
very	1
proud	1
to	1
have	1
it	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
them,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
earned	1
by	1
his	1
own	1
little	1
daughter.	1
Susan	1
resolved	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
telling	1
him	1
of	1
his	1
week's	1
reprieve	1
till	1
he	1
should	1
come	1
home	1
to	1
sup,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
promised	1
to	1
do,	1
in	1
her	1
mother's	1
room.	1
She	1
was	1
not	1
sorry	1
to	1
hear	1
him	1
sigh	1
as	1
he	1
passed	1
the	1
knapsack,	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
packing	1
up	1
for	1
his	1
journey.	1
"How	1
delighted	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
when	1
he	1
hears	1
the	1
good	1
news!"	1
said	1
she,	1
to	1
herself;	1
"but	1
I	1
know	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
little	1
sorry	1
too	1
for	1
my	1
poor	1
lamb."	1
As	1
Susan	1
had	1
now	1
settled	1
all	1
her	1
business,	1
she	1
thought	1
she	1
could	1
have	1
time	1
to	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
meadow	1
by	1
the	1
river	1
side	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
favourite;	1
but	1
just	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
tied	1
on	1
her	1
straw	1
hat	1
the	1
village	1
clock	1
struck	1
four,	1
and	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
hour	1
at	1
which	1
she	1
always	1
went	1
to	1
fetch	1
her	1
little	1
brothers	1
home	1
from	1
a	1
dame-school	1
near	1
the	1
village.	1
She	1
knew	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
be	1
disappointed,	1
if	1
she	1
was	1
later	1
than	1
usual,	1
and	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
to	1
keep	1
them	1
waiting,	1
because	1
they	1
were	1
very	1
patient,	1
good	1
boys;	1
so	1
she	1
put	1
off	1
the	1
visit	1
to	1
her	1
lamb,	1
and	1
went	1
immediately	1
for	1
her	1
brothers.	1
CHAPTER	1
II.	1
Ev'n	1
in	1
the	1
spring	1
and	1
playtime	1
of	1
the	1
year,	1
That	1
calls	1
th'	1
unwonted	1
villager	1
abroad,	1
With	1
all	1
her	1
little	1
ones,	1
a	1

To	1

king-cups	1
in	1
the	1

And	1

with	1

Cowper.	1
The	1
dame-school,	1
which	1
was	1
about	1
a	1
mile	1
from	1
the	1
hamlet,	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
showy	1
edifice;	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
reverenced	1
as	1
much	1
by	1
the	1
young	1
race	1
of	1
village	1
scholars	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
most	1
stately	1
mansion	1
in	1
the	1
land;	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
low	1
roofed,	1
long,	1
thatched	1
tenement,	1
sheltered	1
by	1
a	1
few	1
reverend	1
oaks,	1
under	1
which	1
many	1
generations	1
of	1
hopeful	1
children	1
had	1
gambolled	1
in	1
their	1
turn.	1
The	1
close	1
shaven	1
green,	1
which	1
sloped	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
hatch-door	1
of	1
the	1
schoolroom,	1
was	1
paled	1
round	1
with	1
a	1
rude	1
paling,	1
which,	1
though	1
decayed	1
in	1
some	1
parts	1
by	1
time,	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
any	1
place	1
broken	1
by	1
violence.	1
The	1
place	1
bespoke	1
order	1
and	1
peace.	1
The	1
dame	1
who	1
governed	1
was	1
well	1
obeyed,	1
because	1
she	1
was	1
just	1
and	1
well	1
beloved,	1
and	1
because	1
she	1
was	1
ever	1
glad	1
to	1
give	1
well	1
earned	1
praise	1
and	1
pleasure	1
to	1
her	1
little	1
subjects.	1
Susan	1
had	1
once	1
been	1
under	1
her	1
gentle	1
dominion,	1
and	1
had	1
been	1
deservedly	1
her	1
favourite	1
scholar.	1
The	1
dame	1
often	1
cited	1
her	1
as	1
the	1
best	1
example	1
to	1
the	1
succeeding	1
tribe	1
of	1
emulous	1
youngsters.	1
She	1
had	1
scarcely	1
opened	1
the	1
wicket	1
which	1
separated	1
the	1
green	1
before	1
the	1
schoolroom	1
door	1
from	1
the	1
lane,	1
when	1
she	1
heard	1
the	1
merry	1
voices	1
of	1
the	1
children,	1
and	1
saw	1
the	1
little	1
troup	1
issuing	1
from	1
the	1
hatchway,	1
and	1
spreading	1
over	1
the	1
green.	1
"Oh,	1
there's	1
Susan!"	1
cried	1
her	1
two	1
little	1
brothers,	1
running,	1
leaping,	1
and	1
bounding	1
up	1
to	1
her;	1
and	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
rosy	1
girls	1
and	1
boys	1
crowded	1
round	1
her,	1
to	1
talk	1
of	1
their	1
plays;	1
for	1
Susan	1
was	1
easily	1
interested	1
in	1
all	1
that	1
made	1
others	1
happy;	1
but	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
make	1
them	1
comprehend,	1
that,	1
if	1
they	1
all	1
spoke	1
at	1
once	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
possible	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
hear	1
what	1
was	1
said.	1
The	1
voices	1
were	1
still	1
raised	1
one	1
above	1
another,	1
all	1
eager	1
to	1
establish	1
some	1
important	1
observation	1
about	1
ninepins,	1
or	1
marbles,	1
or	1
tops,	1
or	1
bows	1
and	1
arrows,	1
when	1
suddenly	1
music	1
was	1
heard	1
and	1
the	1
crowd	1
was	1
silenced.	1
The	1
music	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
near	1
the	1
spot	1
where	1
the	1
children	1
were	1
standing,	1
and	1
they	1
looked	1
round	1
to	1
see	1
whence	1
it	1
could	1
come.	1
Susan	1
pointed	1
to	1
the	1
great	1
oak-tree,	1
and	1
they	1
beheld,	1
seated	1
under	1
its	1
shade,	1
an	1
old	1
man	1
playing	1
upon	1
his	1
harp.	1
The	1
children	1
all	1
approached--at	1
first	1
timidly,	1
for	1
the	1
sounds	1
were	1
solemn;	1
but	1
as	1
the	1
harper	1
heard	1
their	1
little	1
footsteps	1
coming	1
towards	1
him,	1
he	1
changed	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
played	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
most	1
lively	1
tunes.	1
The	1
circle	1
closed,	1
and	1
pressed	1
nearer	1
and	1
nearer	1
to	1
him;	1
some	1
who	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
foremost	1
row	1
whispered	1
to	1
each	1
other,	1
"He	1
is	1
blind!"	1
"What	1
a	1
pity!"	1
and	1
"He	1
looks	1
very	1
poor,--what	1
a	1
ragged	1
coat	1
he	1
wears!"	1
said	1
others.	1
"He	1
must	1
be	1
very	1
old,	1
for	1
all	1
his	1
hair	1
is	1
white;	1
and	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
travelled	1
a	1
great	1
way,	1
for	1
his	1
shoes	1
are	1
quite	1
worn	1
out,"	1
observed	1
another.	1
All	1
these	1
remarks	1
were	1
made	1
whilst	1
he	1
was	1
tuning	1
his	1
harp,	1
for	1
when	1
he	1
once	1
more	1
began	1
to	1
play,	1
not	1
a	1
word	1
was	1
uttered.	1
He	1
seemed	1
pleased	1
by	1
their	1
simple	1
exclamations	1
of	1
wonder	1
and	1
delight,	1
and,	1
eager	1
to	1
amuse	1
his	1
young	1
audience,	1
he	1
played	1
now	1
a	1
gay	1
and	1
now	1
a	1
pathetic	1
air,	1
to	1
suit	1
their	1
several	1
humours.	1
Susan's	1
voice,	1
which	1
was	1
soft	1
and	1
sweet,	1
expressive	1
of	1
gentleness	1
and	1
good	1
nature,	1
caught	1
his	1
ear	1
the	1
moment	1
she	1
spoke.	1
He	1
turned	1
his	1
face	1
eagerly	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
she	1
stood;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
observed,	1
that	1
whenever	1
she	1
said	1
that	1
she	1
liked	1
any	1
tune	1
particularly	1
he	1
played	1
it	1
over	1
again.	1
"I	1
am	1
blind,"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
man,	1
"and	1
cannot	1
see	1
your	1
faces;	1
but	1
I	1
know	1
you	1
all	1
asunder	1
by	1
your	1
voices,	1
and	1
I	1
can	1
guess	1
pretty	1
well	1
at	1
all	1
your	1
humours	1
and	1
characters	1
by	1
your	1
voices."	1
"Can	1
you	1
so,	1
indeed?"	1
cried	1
Susan's	1
little	1
brother	1
William,	1
who	1
had	1
stationed	1
himself	1
between	1
the	1
old	1
man's	1
knees.	1
"Then	1
you	1
heard	1
MY	1
sister	1
Susan	1
speak	1
just	1
now.	1
Can	1
you	1
tell	1
us	1
what	1
sort	1
of	1
person	1
she	1
is?"	1
"That	1
I	1
can,	1
I	1
think,	1
without	1
being	1
a	1
conjurer,"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
man,	1
lifting	1
the	1
boy	1
up	1
on	1
his	1
knee;	1
"YOUR	1
sister	1
Susan	1
is	1
good-natured."	1
The	1
boy	1
clapped	1
his	1
hands.	1
"And	1
good-tempered."	1
"RIGHT,"	1
said	1
little	1
William,	1
with	1
a	1
louder	1
clap	1
of	1
applause.	1
"And	1
very	1
fond	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
boy	1
who	1
sits	1
upon	1
my	1
knee."	1
"O	1
right!	1
right!	1
quite	1
right!"	1
exclaimed	1
the	1
child,	1
and	1
"quite	1
right"	1
echoed	1
on	1
all	1
sides.	1
"But	1
how	1
came	1
you	1
to	1
know	1
so	1
much,	1
when	1
you	1
are	1
blind?"	1
said	1
William,	1
examining	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
attentively.	1
"Hush,"	1
said	1
John,	1
who	1
was	1
a	1
year	1
older	1
than	1
his	1
brother,	1
and	1
very	1
sage,	1
"you	1
should	1
not	1
put	1
him	1
in	1
mind	1
of	1
his	1
being	1
blind."	1
"Though	1
I	1
am	1
blind,"	1
said	1
the	1
harper,	1
"I	1
can	1
hear,	1
you	1
know,	1
and	1
I	1
heard	1
from	1
your	1
sister	1
herself	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
told	1
you	1
of	1
her,	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
good-	1
tempered	1
and	1
good-natured	1
and	1
fond	1
of	1
you."	1
"Oh,	1
that's	1
wrong--you	1
did	1
not	1
hear	1
all	1
that	1
from	1
herself,	1
I'm	1
sure,"	1
said	1
John,	1
"for	1
nobody	1
ever	1
hears	1
her	1
praising	1
herself."	1
"Did	1
not	1
I	1
hear	1
her	1
tell	1
you,"	1
said	1
the	1
harper,	1
"when	1
you	1
first	1
came	1
round	1
me,	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
hurry	1
to	1
go	1
home,	1
but	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
stay	1
a	1
little	1
while,	1
since	1
you	1
wished	1
it	1
so	1
much?	1
Was	1
not	1
that	1
good-	1
natured?	1
And	1
when	1
you	1
said	1
you	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
the	1
tune	1
she	1
liked	1
best,	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
angry	1
with	1
you,	1
but	1
said,	1
'Then	1
play	1
William's	1
first,	1
if	1
you	1
please,'--was	1
not	1
that	1
good-tempered?"	1
"Oh,"	1
interrupted	1
William,	1
"it's	1
all	1
true;	1
but	1
how	1
did	1
you	1
find	1
out	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
fond	1
of	1
me?"	1
"That	1
is	1
such	1
a	1
difficult	1
question,"	1
said	1
the	1
harper,	1
"that	1
I	1
must	1
take	1
time	1
to	1
consider."	1
The	1
harper	1
tuned	1
his	1
instrument,	1
as	1
he	1
pondered,	1
or	1
seemed	1
to	1
ponder:	1
and	1
at	1
this	1
instant,	1
two	1
boys	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
searching	1
for	1
birds'	1
nests	1
in	1
the	1
hedges,	1
and	1
who	1
had	1
heard	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
harp,	1
came	1
blustering	1
up,	1
and	1
pushing	1
their	1
way	1
through	1
the	1
circle,	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
exclaimed,	1
"What's	1
going	1
on	1
here?	1
Who	1
are	1
you,	1
my	1
old	1
fellow?	1
A	1
blind	1
harper!	1
Well,	1
play	1
us	1
a	1
tune,	1
if	1
you	1
can	1
play	1
ever	1
a	1
good	1
one--play	1
me--	1
let's	1
see,	1
what	1
shall	1
he	1
play,	1
Bob?"	1
added	1
he	1
turning	1
to	1
his	1
companion.	1
"Bumper	1
Squire	1
Jones."	1
The	1
old	1
man,	1
though	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
quite	1
pleased	1
with	1
the	1
peremptory	1
manner	1
of	1
the	1
request,	1
played,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
desired,	1
"Bumper	1
Squire	1
Jones";	1
and	1
several	1
other	1
tunes	1
were	1
afterwards	1
bespoke	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
rough	1
and	1
tyrannical	1
voice.	1
The	1
little	1
children	1
shrunk	1
back	1
in	1
timid	1
silence,	1
and	1
eyed	1
the	1
brutal	1
boy	1
with	1
dislike.	1
This	1
boy	1
was	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Attorney	1
Case;	1
and	1
as	1
his	1
father	1
had	1
neglected	1
to	1
correct	1
his	1
temper	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
child,	1
as	1
he	1
grew	1
up	1
it	1
became	1
insufferable.	1
All	1
who	1
were	1
younger	1
and	1
weaker	1
than	1
himself,	1
dreaded	1
his	1
approach,	1
and	1
detested	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
tyrant.	1
When	1
the	1
old	1
harper	1
was	1
so	1
tired	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
play	1
no	1
more,	1
a	1
lad,	1
who	1
usually	1
carried	1
his	1
harp	1
for	1
him,	1
and	1
who	1
was	1
within	1
call,	1
came	1
up,	1
and	1
held	1
his	1
master's	1
hat	1
to	1
the	1
company,	1
saying,	1
"Will	1
you	1
be	1
pleased	1
to	1
remember	1
us?"	1
The	1
children	1
readily	1
produced	1
their	1
halfpence,	1
and	1
thought	1
their	1
wealth	1
well	1
bestowed	1
upon	1
this	1
poor,	1
good-natured	1
man,	1
who	1
had	1
taken	1
so	1
much	1
pains	1
to	1
entertain	1
them,	1
better	1
even	1
than	1
upon	1
the	1
gingerbread	1
woman,	1
whose	1
stall	1
they	1
loved	1
to	1
frequent.	1
The	1
hat	1
was	1
held	1
some	1
time	1
to	1
the	1
attorney's	1
son	1
before	1
he	1
chose	1
to	1
see	1
it.	1
At	1
last	1
he	1
put	1
his	1
hand	1
surlily	1
into	1
his	1
waistcoat	1
pocket	1
and	1
pulled	1
out	1
a	1
shilling.	1
There	1
were	1
sixpennyworth	1
of	1
halfpence	1
in	1
the	1
hat.	1
"I'll	1
take	1
these	1
halfpence,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"and	1
here's	1
a	1
shilling	1
for	1
you."	1
"God	1
bless	1
you,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
the	1
lad;	1
but	1
as	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
shilling	1
which	1
the	1
young	1
gentleman	1
had	1
slily	1
put	1
INTO	1
THE	1
BLIND	1
MAN'S	1
HAND,	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
worth	1
one	1
farthing.	1
"I	1
am	1
afraid	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
good,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
the	1
lad,	1
whose	1
business	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
examine	1
the	1
money	1
for	1
his	1
master.	1
"I	1
am	1
afraid,	1
then,	1
you'll	1
get	1
no	1
other,"	1
said	1
young	1
Case,	1
with	1
an	1
insulting	1
laugh.	1
"It	1
never	1
will	1
do,	1
sir,"	1
persisted	1
the	1
lad;	1
"look	1
at	1
it	1
yourself;	1
the	1
edges	1
are	1
all	1
yellow!	1
you	1
can	1
see	1
the	1
copper	1
through	1
it	1
quite	1
plain.	1
Sir,	1
nobody	1
will	1
take	1
it	1
from	1
us."	1
"That's	1
your	1
affair,"	1
said	1
the	1
brutal	1
boy,	1
pushing	1
away	1
his	1
hand.	1
"You	1
may	1
pass	1
it,	1
you	1
know,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
I	1
do,	1
if	1
you	1
look	1
sharp.	1
You	1
have	1
taken	1
it	1
from	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
shan't	1
take	1
it	1
back	1
again,	1
I	1
promise	1
you."	1
A	1
whisper	1
of	1
"that's	1
very	1
unjust,"	1
was	1
heard.	1
The	1
little	1
assembly,	1
though	1
under	1
evident	1
constraint,	1
could	1
no	1
longer	1
suppress	1
their	1
indignation.	1
"Who	1
says	1
it's	1
unjust?"	1
cried	1
the	1
tyrant,	1
sternly,	1
looking	1
down	1
upon	1
his	1
judges.	1
Susan's	1
little	1
brothers	1
had	1
held	1
her	1
gown	1
fast,	1
to	1
prevent	1
her	1
from	1
moving	1
at	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
this	1
contest,	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
now	1
so	1
much	1
interested	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
it,	1
that	1
she	1
stood	1
still,	1
without	1
making	1
any	1
resistance.	1
"Is	1
anyone	1
here	1
amongst	1
yourselves	1
a	1
judge	1
of	1
silver?"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
man.	1
"Yes,	1
here's	1
the	1
butcher's	1
boy,"	1
said	1
the	1
attorney's	1
son;	1
"show	1
it	1
to	1
him."	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
sickly-looking	1
boy,	1
and	1
of	1
a	1
remarkably	1
peaceful	1
disposition.	1
Young	1
Case	1
fancied	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
afraid	1
to	1
give	1
judgment	1
against	1
him.	1
However,	1
after	1
some	1
moments'	1
hesitation,	1
and	1
after	1
turning	1
the	1
shilling	1
round	1
several	1
times,	1
he	1
pronounced,	1
"that,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
his	1
judgment	1
went,	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
pretend	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
downright	1
CERTAIN	1
SURE	1
of	1
it,	1
the	1
shilling	1
was	1
not	1
over	1
and	1
above	1
good."	1
Then	1
to	1
Susan,	1
to	1
screen	1
himself	1
from	1
manifest	1
danger,	1
for	1
the	1
attorney's	1
son	1
looked	1
upon	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
vengeful	1
mien,	1
"But	1
here's	1
Susan	1
here,	1
who	1
understands	1
silver	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
better	1
than	1
I	1
do;	1
she	1
takes	1
a	1
power	1
of	1
it	1
for	1
bread,	1
you	1
know."	1
"I'll	1
leave	1
it	1
to	1
her,"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
harper;	1
"if	1
she	1
says	1
the	1
shilling	1
is	1
good,	1
keep	1
it,	1
Jack."	1
The	1
shilling	1
was	1
handed	1
to	1
Susan,	1
who,	1
though	1
she	1
had	1
with	1
becoming	1
modesty	1
forborne	1
all	1
interference,	1
did	1
not	1
hesitate,	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
called	1
upon,	1
to	1
speak	1
the	1
truth:	1
"I	1
think	1
that	1
this	1
shilling	1
is	1
a	1
bad	1
one,"	1
said	1
she;	1
and	1
the	1
gentle	1
but	1
firm	1
tone	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
pronounced	1
the	1
words,	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
awed	1
and	1
silenced	1
the	1
angry	1
and	1
brutal	1
boy.	1
"There's	1
another,	1
then,"	1
cried	1
he;	1
"I	1
have	1
sixpences	1
and	1
shillings	1
too	1
in	1
plenty,	1
thank	1
my	1
stars."	1
Susan	1
now	1
walked	1
away	1
with	1
her	1
two	1
little	1
brothers,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
other	1
children	1
separated	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
their	1
several	1
homes.	1
The	1
old	1
harper	1
called	1
to	1
Susan,	1
and	1
begged,	1
that,	1
if	1
she	1
was	1
going	1
towards	1
the	1
village,	1
she	1
would	1
be	1
so	1
kind	1
as	1
to	1
show	1
him	1
the	1
way.	1
His	1
lad	1
took	1
up	1
his	1
harp,	1
and	1
little	1
William	1
took	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
by	1
the	1
hand.	1
"I'll	1
lead	1
him,	1
I	1
can	1
lead	1
him,"	1
said	1
he;	1
and	1
John	1
ran	1
on	1
before	1
them,	1
to	1
gather	1
king-cups	1
in	1
the	1
meadow.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
small	1
rivulet,	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
to	1
cross,	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
plank	1
which	1
served	1
for	1
a	1
bridge	1
over	1
it	1
was	1
rather	1
narrow,	1
Susan	1
was	1
afraid	1
to	1
trust	1
the	1
old	1
blind	1
man	1
to	1
his	1
little	1
conductor;	1
she	1
therefore	1
went	1
on	1
the	1
tottering	1
plank	1
first	1
herself,	1
and	1
then	1
led	1
the	1
old	1
harper	1
carefully	1
over.	1
They	1
were	1
now	1
come	1
to	1
a	1
gate,	1
which	1
opened	1
upon	1
the	1
high	1
road	1
to	1
the	1
village.	1
"There	1
is	1
the	1
high	1
road	1
straight	1
before	1
you,"	1
said	1
Susan	1
to	1
the	1
lad,	1
who	1
was	1
carrying	1
his	1
master's	1
harp;	1
"you	1
can't	1
miss	1
it.	1
Now	1
I	1
must	1
bid	1
you	1
a	1
good	1
evening;	1
for	1
I'm	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
hurry	1
to	1
get	1
home,	1
and	1
must	1
go	1
the	1
short	1
way	1
across	1
the	1
fields	1
here,	1
which	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
so	1
pleasant	1
for	1
you,	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
stiles.	1
Good-bye."	1
The	1
old	1
harper	1
thanked	1
her,	1
and	1
went	1
along	1
the	1
high	1
road,	1
whilst	1
she	1
and	1
her	1
brothers	1
tripped	1
on	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
they	1
could	1
by	1
the	1
short	1
way	1
across	1
the	1
fields.	1
"Miss	1
Somers,	1
I	1
am	1
afraid,	1
will	1
be	1
waiting	1
for	1
us,"	1
said	1
Susan.	1
"You	1
know	1
she	1
said	1
she	1
would	1
call	1
at	1
six;	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
length	1
of	1
our	1
shadows	1
I'm	1
sure	1
it	1
is	1
late."	1
When	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
their	1
own	1
cottage-door,	1
they	1
heard	1
many	1
voices,	1
and	1
they	1
saw,	1
when	1
they	1
entered,	1
several	1
ladies	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
kitchen.	1
"Come	1
in,	1
Susan;	1
we	1
thought	1
you	1
had	1
quite	1
forsaken	1
us,"	1
said	1
Miss	1
Somers	1
to	1
Susan,	1
who	1
advanced	1
timidly.	1
"I	1
fancy	1
you	1
forgot	1
that	1
we	1
promised	1
to	1
pay	1
you	1
a	1
visit	1
this	1
evening,	1
but	1
you	1
need	1
not	1
blush	1
so	1
much	1
about	1
the	1
matter;	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
great	1
harm	1
done;	1
we	1
have	1
only	1
been	1
here	1
about	1
five	1
minutes;	1
and	1
we	1
have	1
been	1
well	1
employed	1
in	1
admiring	1
your	1
neat	1
garden,	1
and	1
your	1
orderly	1
shelves.	1
Is	1
it	1
you,	1
Susan,	1
who	1
keeps	1
these	1
things	1
in	1
such	1
nice	1
order?"	1
continued	1
Miss	1
Somers,	1
looking	1
round	1
the	1
kitchen.	1
Before	1
Susan	1
could	1
reply,	1
little	1
William	1
pushed	1
forward,	1
and	1
answered,	1
"Yes,	1
ma'am,	1
it	1
is	1
MY	1
sister	1
Susan	1
that	1
keeps	1
everything	1
neat;	1
and	1
she	1
always	1
comes	1
to	1
school	1
for	1
us,	1
too,	1
which	1
was	1
what	1
caused	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
late."	1
"Because	1
as	1
how,"	1
continued	1
John,	1
"she	1
was	1
loth	1
to	1
refuse	1
us	1
the	1
hearing	1
a	1
blind	1
man	1
play	1
on	1
the	1
harp.	1
It	1
was	1
we	1
kept	1
her,	1
and	1
we	1
hopes,	1
ma'am,	1
as	1
you	1
ARE--as	1
you	1
SEEM	1
so	1
good,	1
you	1
won't	1
take	1
it	1
amiss."	1
Miss	1
Somers	1
and	1
her	1
sister	1
smiled	1
at	1
the	1
affectionate	1
simplicity	1
with	1
which	1
Susan's	1
little	1
brothers	1
undertook	1
her	1
defence,	1
and	1
they	1
were,	1
from	1
this	1
slight	1
circumstance,	1
disposed	1
to	1
think	1
yet	1
more	1
favourably	1
of	1
a	1
family	1
which	1
seemed	1
so	1
well	1
united.	1
They	1
took	1
Susan	1
along	1
with	1
them	1
through	1
the	1
village.	1
Many	1
neighbours	1
came	1
to	1
their	1
doors,	1
and	1
far	1
from	1
envying,	1
they	1
all	1
secretly	1
wished	1
Susan	1
well	1
as	1
she	1
passed.	1
"I	1
fancy	1
we	1
shall	1
find	1
what	1
we	1
want	1
here,"	1
said	1
Miss	1
Somers,	1
stopping	1
before	1
a	1
shop,	1
where	1
unfolded	1
sheets	1
of	1
pins	1
and	1
glass	1
buttons	1
glistened	1
in	1
the	1
window,	1
and	1
where	1
rolls	1
of	1
many	1
coloured	1
ribbons	1
appeared	1
ranged	1
in	1
tempting	1
order.	1
She	1
went	1
in,	1
and	1
was	1
rejoiced	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
shelves	1
at	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
the	1
counter	1
well-furnished	1
with	1
glossy	1
tiers	1
of	1
stuffs,	1
and	1
gay,	1
neat	1
printed	1
linens	1
and	1
calicoes.	1
"Now,	1
Susan,	1
choose	1
yourself	1
a	1
gown,"	1
said	1
Miss	1
Somers;	1
"you	1
set	1
an	1
example	1
of	1
industry	1
and	1
good	1
conduct,	1
of	1
which	1
we	1
wish	1
to	1
take	1
public	1
notice,	1
for	1
the	1
benefit	1
of	1
others."	1
The	1
shopkeeper,	1
who	1
was	1
father	1
to	1
Susan's	1
friend	1
Rose,	1
looked	1
much	1
satisfied	1
by	1
this	1
speech,	1
and	1
as	1
if	1
a	1
compliment	1
had	1
been	1
paid	1
to	1
himself,	1
bowed	1
low	1
to	1
Miss	1
Somers,	1
and	1
then	1
with	1
alertness,	1
which	1
a	1
London	1
linen-draper	1
might	1
have	1
admired,	1
produced	1
piece	1
after	1
piece	1
of	1
his	1
best	1
goods	1
to	1
his	1
young	1
customer--unrolled,	1
unfolded,	1
held	1
the	1
bright	1
stuffs	1
and	1
calendered	1
calicoes	1
in	1
various	1
lights.	1
Now	1
stretched	1
his	1
arm	1
to	1
the	1
highest	1
shelves,	1
and	1
brought	1
down	1
in	1
a	1
trice	1
what	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
beyond	1
the	1
reach	1
of	1
any	1
but	1
a	1
giant's	1
arm;	1
now	1
dived	1
into	1
some	1
hidden	1
recess	1
beneath	1
the	1
counter,	1
and	1
brought	1
to	1
light	1
fresh	1
beauties	1
and	1
fresh	1
temptations.	1
Susan	1
looked	1
on	1
with	1
more	1
indifference	1
than	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
spectators.	1
She	1
was	1
thinking	1
much	1
of	1
her	1
lamb,	1
and	1
more	1
of	1
her	1
father.	1
Miss	1
Somers	1
had	1
put	1
a	1
bright	1
guinea	1
into	1
her	1
hand,	1
and	1
had	1
bid	1
her	1
pay	1
for	1
her	1
own	1
gown;	1
but	1
Susan,	1
as	1
she	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
guinea,	1
thought	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
money	1
to	1
lay	1
out	1
upon	1
herself,	1
and	1
she	1
wished,	1
but	1
did	1
know	1
like	1
to	1
ask,	1
that	1
she	1
might	1
keep	1
it	1
for	1
a	1
better	1
purpose.	1
Some	1
people	1
are	1
wholly	1
inattentive	1
to	1
the	1
lesser	1
feelings,	1
and	1
incapable	1
of	1
reading	1
the	1
countenances	1
of	1
those	1
on	1
whom	1
they	1
bestow	1
their	1
bounty.	1
Miss	1
Somers	1
and	1
her	1
sister	1
were	1
not	1
of	1
this	1
roughly	1
charitable	1
class.	1
"She	1
does	1
not	1
like	1
any	1
of	1
these	1
things,"	1
whispered	1
Miss	1
Somers	1
to	1
her	1
sister.	1
Her	1
sister	1
observed,	1
that	1
Susan	1
looked	1
as	1
if	1
her	1
thoughts	1
were	1
far	1
distant	1
from	1
gowns.	1
"If	1
you	1
don't	1
fancy	1
any	1
of	1
these,"	1
said	1
the	1
civil	1
shopkeeper	1
to	1
Susan,	1
"we	1
shall	1
have	1
a	1
new	1
assortment	1
of	1
calicoes	1
for	1
the	1
spring	1
season,	1
soon	1
from	1
town."	1
"Oh,"	1
interrupted	1
Susan,	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
and	1
a	1
blush;	1
"these	1
are	1
all	1
pretty,	1
and	1
too	1
good	1
for	1
me,	1
but--"	1
"BUT	1
what,	1
Susan?"	1
said	1
Miss	1
Somers.	1
"Tell	1
us	1
what	1
is	1
passing	1
in	1
your	1
little	1
mind."	1
Susan	1
hesitated.	1
"Well	1
then,	1
we	1
will	1
not	1
press	1
you,	1
you	1
are	1
scarcely	1
acquainted	1
with	1
us	1
yet;	1
when	1
you	1
are,	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
afraid,	1
I	1
hope,	1
to	1
speak	1
your	1
mind.	1
Put	1
this	1
shining	1
yellow	1
counter,"	1
continued	1
she,	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
guinea,	1
"in	1
your	1
pocket,	1
and	1
make	1
what	1
use	1
of	1
it	1
you	1
please.	1
From	1
what	1
we	1
know,	1
and	1
from	1
what	1
we	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
you,	1
we	1
are	1
persuaded	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
make	1
a	1
good	1
use	1
of	1
it."	1
"I	1
think,	1
madam,"	1
said	1
the	1
master	1
of	1
the	1
shop,	1
with	1
a	1
shrewd,	1
good	1
natured	1
look,	1
"I	1
could	1
give	1
a	1
pretty	1
good	1
guess	1
myself	1
what	1
will	1
become	1
of	1
that	1
guinea;	1
but	1
I	1
say	1
nothing."	1
"No,	1
that	1
is	1
right,"	1
said	1
Miss	1
Somers;	1
"we	1
leave	1
Susan	1
entirely	1
at	1
liberty;	1
and	1
now	1
we	1
will	1
not	1
detain	1
her	1
any	1
longer.	1
Good	1
night,	1
Susan,	1
we	1
shall	1
soon	1
come	1
again	1
to	1
your	1
neat	1
cottage."	1
Susan	1
curtsied,	1
with	1
an	1
expressive	1
look	1
of	1
gratitude,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
modest	1
frankness	1
in	1
her	1
countenance,	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
say,	1
"I	1
would	1
tell	1
you,	1
and	1
welcome,	1
what	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
the	1
guinea;	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
used	1
to	1
speak	1
before	1
so	1
many	1
people.	1
When	1
you	1
come	1
to	1
our	1
cottage	1
again	1
you	1
shall	1
know	1
all."	1
When	1
Susan	1
had	1
departed,	1
Miss	1
Somers	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
obliging	1
shopkeeper,	1
who	1
was	1
folding	1
up	1
all	1
the	1
things	1
he	1
had	1
opened.	1
"You	1
have	1
had	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
trouble	1
with	1
us,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
she;	1
"and	1
since	1
Susan	1
will	1
not	1
choose	1
a	1
gown	1
for	1
herself,	1
I	1
must."	1
She	1
selected	1
the	1
prettiest;	1
and	1
whilst	1
the	1
man	1
was	1
rolling	1
it	1
in	1
paper,	1
she	1
asked	1
him	1
several	1
questions	1
about	1
Susan	1
and	1
her	1
family,	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
delighted	1
to	1
answer,	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
now	1
all	1
opportunity	1
of	1
saying	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
he	1
wished	1
in	1
her	1
praise.	1
"No	1
later	1
back,	1
ma'am,	1
than	1
last	1
May	1
morning,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"as	1
my	1
daughter	1
Rose	1
was	1
telling	1
us,	1
Susan	1
did	1
a	1
turn,	1
in	1
her	1
quiet	1
way,	1
by	1
her	1
mother,	1
that	1
would	1
not	1
displease	1
you	1
if	1
you	1
were	1
to	1
hear	1
it.	1
She	1
was	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
Queen	1
of	1
the	1
May,	1
which	1
in	1
our	1
little	1
village,	1
amongst	1
the	1
younger	1
tribe,	1
is	1
a	1
thing	1
that	1
is	1
thought	1
of	1
a	1
good	1
deal;	1
but	1
Susan's	1
mother	1
was	1
ill,	1
and	1
Susan,	1
after	1
sitting	1
up	1
with	1
her	1
all	1
night,	1
would	1
not	1
leave	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
even	1
when	1
they	1
brought	1
the	1
crown	1
to	1
her.	1
She	1
put	1
the	1
crown	1
upon	1
my	1
daughter	1
Rose's	1
head	1
with	1
her	1
own	1
hands;	1
and,	1
to	1
be	1
sure,	1
Rose	1
loves	1
her	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
was	1
her	1
own	1
sister.	1
But	1
I	1
don't	1
speak	1
from	1
partiality;	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
no	1
relation	1
whatever	1
to	1
the	1
Prices--only	1
a	1
well-wisher,	1
as	1
everyone,	1
I	1
believe,	1
who	1
knows	1
them	1
is.	1
I'll	1
send	1
the	1
parcel	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
Abbey,	1
shall	1
I,	1
ma'am?"	1
"If	1
you	1
please,"	1
said	1
Miss	1
Somers,	1
"and,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
you	1
receive	1
your	1
new	1
things	1
from	1
town,	1
let	1
us	1
know.	1
You	1
will,	1
I	1
hope,	1
find	1
us	1
good	1
customers	1
and	1
well-wishers,"	1
added	1
she,	1
with	1
a	1
smile;	1
"for	1
those	1
who	1
wish	1
well	1
to	1
their	1
neighbours	1
surely	1
deserve	1
to	1
have	1
well-wishers	1
themselves."	1
A	1
few	1
words	1
may	1
encourage	1
the	1
benevolent	1
passions,	1
and	1
may	1
dispose	1
people	1
to	1
live	1
in	1
peace	1
and	1
happiness;	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
may	1
set	1
them	1
at	1
variance,	1
and	1
may	1
lead	1
to	1
misery	1
and	1
lawsuits.	1
Attorney	1
Case	1
and	1
Miss	1
Somers	1
were	1
both	1
equally	1
convinced	1
of	1
this,	1
and	1
their	1
practice	1
was	1
uniformly	1
consistent	1
with	1
their	1
principles.	1
But	1
now	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
Susan.	1
She	1
put	1
the	1
bright	1
guinea	1
carefully	1
into	1
the	1
glove	1
with	1
the	1
twelve	1
shillings,	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
received	1
from	1
her	1
companions	1
on	1
May	1
day.	1
Besides	1
this	1
treasure,	1
she	1
calculated	1
that	1
the	1
amount	1
of	1
the	1
bills	1
for	1
bread	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
less	1
than	1
eight	1
or	1
nine	1
and	1
thirty	1
shillings;	1
and	1
as	1
her	1
father	1
was	1
now	1
sure	1
of	1
a	1
week's	1
reprieve,	1
she	1
had	1
great	1
hopes	1
that,	1
by	1
some	1
means	1
or	1
other,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
possible	1
to	1
make	1
up	1
the	1
whole	1
sum	1
necessary	1
to	1
pay	1
for	1
a	1
substitute.	1
"If	1
that	1
could	1
but	1
be	1
done,"	1
said	1
she	1
to	1
herself,	1
"how	1
happy	1
would	1
my	1
mother	1
be.	1
She	1
would	1
be	1
quite	1
stout	1
again,	1
for	1
she	1
certainly	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
better,	1
since	1
I	1
told	1
her	1
that	1
father	1
would	1
stay	1
a	1
week	1
longer.	1
Ah!	1
but	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
blessed	1
Attorney	1
Case,	1
though,	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
known	1
about	1
my	1
poor	1
Daisy."	1
Susan	1
took	1
the	1
path	1
that	1
led	1
to	1
the	1
meadow	1
by	1
the	1
waterside,	1
resolved	1
to	1
go	1
by	1
herself,	1
and	1
take	1
leave	1
of	1
her	1
innocent	1
favourite.	1
But	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
pass	1
by	1
unperceived.	1
Her	1
little	1
brothers	1
were	1
watching	1
for	1
her	1
return,	1
and,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
saw	1
her,	1
they	1
ran	1
after	1
her,	1
and	1
overtook	1
her	1
as	1
she	1
reached	1
the	1
meadow.	1
"What	1
did	1
that	1
good	1
lady	1
want	1
with	1
you?"	1
cried	1
William;	1
but,	1
looking	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
sister's	1
face,	1
he	1
saw	1
tears	1
in	1
her	1
eyes,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
silent,	1
and	1
walked	1
on	1
quietly.	1
Susan	1
saw	1
her	1
lamb	1
by	1
the	1
water-side.	1
"Who	1
are	1
those	1
two	1
men?"	1
said	1
William.	1
"What	1
are	1
they	1
going	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
DAISY?"	1
The	1
two	1
men	1
were	1
Attorney	1
Case	1
and	1
the	1
butcher.	1
The	1
butcher	1
was	1
feeling	1
whether	1
the	1
lamb	1
was	1
fat.	1
Susan	1
sat	1
down	1
upon	1
the	1
bank	1
in	1
silent	1
sorrow;	1
her	1
little	1
brothers	1
ran	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
butcher,	1
and	1
demanded	1
whether	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
DO	1
ANY	1
HARM	1
to	1
the	1
lamb.	1
The	1
butcher	1
did	1
not	1
answer,	1
but	1
the	1
attorney	1
replied,	1
"It	1
is	1
not	1
your	1
sister's	1
lamb	1
any	1
longer;	1
it's	1
mine--mine	1
to	1
all	1
intents	1
and	1
purposes."	1
"Yours!"	1
cried	1
the	1
children,	1
with	1
terror;	1
"and	1
will	1
you	1
kill	1
it?"	1
"That's	1
the	1
butcher's	1
business."	1
The	1
little	1
boys	1
now	1
burst	1
into	1
piercing	1
lamentations.	1
They	1
pushed	1
away	1
the	1
butcher's	1
hand;	1
they	1
threw	1
their	1
arms	1
round	1
the	1
neck	1
of	1
the	1
lamb;	1
they	1
kissed	1
its	1
forehead--it	1
bleated.	1
"It	1
will	1
not	1
bleat	1
to-morrow!"	1
said	1
William,	1
and	1
he	1
wept	1
bitterly.	1
The	1
butcher	1
looked	1
aside,	1
and	1
hastily	1
rubbed	1
his	1
eyes	1
with	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
his	1
blue	1
apron.	1
The	1
attorney	1
stood	1
unmoved;	1
he	1
pulled	1
up	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
lamb,	1
which	1
had	1
just	1
stooped	1
to	1
crop	1
a	1
mouthful	1
of	1
clover.	1
"I	1
have	1
no	1
time	1
to	1
waste,"	1
said	1
he;	1
"butcher,	1
you'll	1
account	1
with	1
me.	1
If	1
it's	1
fat--the	1
sooner	1
the	1
better.	1
I've	1
no	1
more	1
to	1
say."	1
And	1
he	1
walked	1
off,	1
deaf	1
to	1
the	1
prayers	1
of	1
the	1
poor	1
children.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
attorney	1
was	1
out	1
of	1
sight,	1
Susan	1
rose	1
from	1
the	1
bank	1
where	1
she	1
was	1
seated,	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
lamb,	1
and	1
stooped	1
to	1
gather	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
fresh	1
dewy	1
trefoil,	1
to	1
let	1
it	1
eat	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
hand	1
for	1
the	1
last	1
time.	1
Poor	1
Daisy	1
licked	1
her	1
well	1
known	1
hand.	1
"Now,	1
let	1
us	1
go,"	1
said	1
Susan.	1
"I'll	1
wait	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
you	1
please,"	1
said	1
the	1
butcher.	1
Susan	1
thanked	1
him,	1
but	1
walked	1
away	1
quickly,	1
without	1
looking	1
again	1
at	1
her	1
lamb.	1
Her	1
little	1
brothers	1
begged	1
the	1
man	1
to	1
stay	1
a	1
few	1
minutes,	1
for	1
they	1
had	1
gathered	1
a	1
handful	1
of	1
blue	1
speedwell	1
and	1
yellow	1
crowsfoot,	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
decking	1
the	1
poor	1
animal.	1
As	1
it	1
followed	1
the	1
boys	1
through	1
the	1
village,	1
the	1
children	1
collected	1
as	1
they	1
passed,	1
and	1
the	1
butcher's	1
own	1
son	1
was	1
amongst	1
the	1
number.	1
Susan's	1
steadiness	1
about	1
the	1
bad	1
shilling	1
was	1
full	1
in	1
this	1
boy's	1
memory;	1
it	1
had	1
saved	1
him	1
a	1
beating.	1
He	1
went	1
directly	1
to	1
his	1
father	1
to	1
beg	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
Susan's	1
lamb.	1
"I	1
was	1
thinking	1
about	1
it,	1
boy,	1
myself,"	1
said	1
the	1
butcher;	1
"it's	1
a	1
sin	1
to	1
kill	1
a	1
PET	1
LAMB,	1
I'm	1
thinking--any	1
way,	1
it's	1
what	1
I'm	1
not	1
used	1
to,	1
and	1
don't	1
fancy	1
doing,	1
and	1
I'll	1
go	1
and	1
say	1
as	1
much	1
to	1
Attorney	1
Case;	1
but	1
he's	1
a	1
hard	1
man;	1
there's	1
but	1
one	1
way	1
to	1
deal	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
that's	1
the	1
way	1
I	1
must	1
take,	1
though	1
so	1
be	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
loser	1
thereby;	1
but	1
we'll	1
say	1
nothing	1
to	1
the	1
boys,	1
for	1
fear	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
the	1
thing	1
would	1
not	1
take;	1
and	1
then	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
worse	1
again	1
to	1
poor	1
Susan,	1
who	1
is	1
a	1
good	1
girl,	1
and	1
always	1
was,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
she	1
may,	1
being	1
of	1
a	1
good	1
breed,	1
and	1
well	1
reared	1
from	1
the	1
first."	1
"Come,	1
lads,	1
don't	1
keep	1
a	1
crowd	1
and	1
a	1
scandal	1
about	1
my	1
door,"	1
continued	1
he,	1
aloud,	1
to	1
the	1
children;	1
"turn	1
the	1
lamb	1
in	1
here,	1
John,	1
in	1
the	1
paddock,	1
for	1
to-night,	1
and	1
go	1
your	1
ways	1
home."	1
The	1
crowd	1
dispersed,	1
but	1
murmured,	1
and	1
the	1
butcher	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
attorney.	1
"Seeing	1
that	1
all	1
you	1
want	1
is	1
a	1
good,	1
fat,	1
tender	1
lamb,	1
for	1
a	1
present	1
for	1
Sir	1
Arthur,	1
as	1
you	1
told	1
me,"	1
said	1
the	1
butcher,	1
"I	1
could	1
let	1
you	1
have	1
what's	1
as	1
good	1
or	1
better	1
for	1
your	1
purpose."	1
"Better--if	1
it's	1
better,	1
I'm	1
ready	1
to	1
hear	1
reason."	1
The	1
butcher	1
had	1
choice,	1
tender	1
lamb,	1
he	1
said,	1
fit	1
to	1
eat	1
the	1
next	1
day;	1
and	1
as	1
Mr.	1
Case	1
was	1
impatient	1
to	1
make	1
his	1
offering	1
to	1
Sir	1
Arthur,	1
he	1
accepted	1
the	1
butcher's	1
proposal,	1
though	1
with	1
such	1
seeming	1
reluctance,	1
that	1
he	1
actually	1
squeezed	1
out	1
of	1
him,	1
before	1
he	1
would	1
complete	1
the	1
bargain,	1
a	1
bribe	1
of	1
a	1
fine	1
sweetbread.	1
In	1
the	1
meantime	1
Susan's	1
brothers	1
ran	1
home	1
to	1
tell	1
her	1
that	1
her	1
lamb	1
was	1
put	1
into	1
the	1
paddock	1
for	1
the	1
night;	1
this	1
was	1
all	1
they	1
knew,	1
and	1
even	1
this	1
was	1
some	1
comfort	1
to	1
her.	1
Rose,	1
her	1
good	1
friend,	1
was	1
with	1
her,	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
before	1
her	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
telling	1
her	1
father	1
of	1
his	1
week's	1
reprieve.	1
Her	1
mother	1
was	1
better,	1
and	1
even	1
said	1
she	1
was	1
determined	1
to	1
sit	1
up	1
to	1
supper	1
in	1
her	1
wicker	1
armchair.	1
Susan	1
was	1
getting	1
this	1
ready	1
for	1
supper,	1
when	1
little	1
William,	1
who	1
was	1
standing	1
at	1
the	1
house	1
door,	1
watching	1
in	1
the	1
dusk	1
for	1
his	1
father's	1
return,	1
suddenly	1
exclaimed,	1
"Susan!	1
if	1
here	1
is	1
not	1
our	1
old	1
man!"	1
"Yes,"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
harper,	1
"I	1
have	1
found	1
my	1
way	1
to	1
you.	1
The	1
neighbours	1
were	1
kind	1
enough	1
to	1
show	1
me	1
whereabouts	1
you	1
lived;	1
for,	1
though	1
I	1
didn't	1
know	1
your	1
name,	1
they	1
guessed	1
who	1
I	1
meant	1
by	1
what	1
I	1
said	1
of	1
you	1
all."	1
Susan	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
was	1
delighted	1
to	1
hear	1
her	1
speak	1
again.	1
"If	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
too	1
bold,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"I'm	1
a	1
stranger	1
in	1
this	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
country,	1
and	1
come	1
from	1
afar	1
off.	1
My	1
boy	1
has	1
got	1
a	1
bed	1
for	1
himself	1
here	1
in	1
the	1
village;	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
place.	1
Could	1
you	1
be	1
so	1
charitable	1
as	1
to	1
give	1
an	1
old	1
blind	1
man	1
a	1
night's	1
lodging?"	1
Susan	1
said	1
she	1
would	1
step	1
in	1
and	1
ask	1
her	1
mother;	1
and	1
she	1
soon	1
returned	1
with	1
an	1
answer,	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
heartily	1
welcome,	1
if	1
he	1
could	1
sleep	1
upon	1
the	1
children's	1
bed,	1
which	1
was	1
but	1
small.	1
The	1
old	1
man	1
thankfully	1
entered	1
the	1
hospitable	1
cottage.	1
He	1
struck	1
his	1
head	1
against	1
the	1
low	1
roof,	1
as	1
he	1
stepped	1
over	1
the	1
doorsill.	1
"Many	1
roofs	1
that	1
are	1
twice	1
as	1
high	1
are	1
not	1
half	1
so	1
good,"	1
said	1
he.	1
Of	1
this	1
he	1
had	1
just	1
had	1
experience	1
at	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
Attorney	1
Case,	1
while	1
he	1
had	1
asked,	1
but	1
had	1
been	1
roughly	1
refused	1
all	1
assistance	1
by	1
Miss	1
Barbara,	1
who	1
was,	1
according	1
to	1
her	1
usual	1
custom,	1
standing	1
staring	1
at	1
the	1
hall	1
door.	1
The	1
old	1
man's	1
harp	1
was	1
set	1
down	1
in	1
Farmer	1
Price's	1
kitchen,	1
and	1
he	1
promised	1
to	1
play	1
a	1
tune	1
for	1
the	1
boys	1
before	1
they	1
went	1
to	1
bed;	1
their	1
mother	1
giving	1
them	1
leave	1
to	1
sit	1
up	1
to	1
supper	1
with	1
their	1
father.	1
He	1
came	1
home	1
with	1
a	1
sorrowful	1
countenance;	1
but	1
how	1
soon	1
did	1
it	1
brighten,	1
when	1
Susan,	1
with	1
a	1
smile,	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
"Father,	1
we've	1
good	1
news	1
for	1
you!	1
good	1
news	1
for	1
us	1
all!--You	1
have	1
a	1
whole	1
week	1
longer	1
to	1
stay	1
with	1
us;	1
and	1
perhaps,"	1
continued	1
she,	1
putting	1
her	1
little	1
purse	1
into	1
his	1
hands,--	1
"perhaps	1
with	1
what's	1
here,	1
and	1
the	1
bread	1
bills,	1
and	1
what	1
may	1
somehow	1
be	1
got	1
together	1
before	1
a	1
week's	1
at	1
an	1
end,	1
we	1
may	1
make	1
up	1
the	1
nine	1
guineas	1
for	1
the	1
substitute,	1
as	1
they	1
call	1
him.	1
Who	1
knows,	1
dearest	1
mother,	1
but	1
we	1
may	1
keep	1
him	1
with	1
us	1
for	1
ever!"	1
As	1
she	1
spoke,	1
she	1
threw	1
her	1
arms	1
round	1
her	1
father,	1
who	1
pressed	1
her	1
to	1
his	1
bosom	1
without	1
speaking,	1
for	1
his	1
heart	1
was	1
full.	1
He	1
was	1
some	1
little	1
time	1
before	1
he	1
could	1
perfectly	1
believe	1
that	1
what	1
he	1
heard	1
was	1
true;	1
but	1
the	1
revived	1
smiles	1
of	1
his	1
wife,	1
the	1
noisy	1
joy	1
of	1
his	1
little	1
boys,	1
and	1
the	1
satisfaction	1
that	1
shone	1
in	1
Susan's	1
countenance,	1
convinced	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
a	1
dream.	1
As	1
they	1
sat	1
down	1
to	1
supper,	1
the	1
old	1
harper	1
was	1
made	1
welcome	1
to	1
his	1
share	1
of	1
the	1
cheerful	1
though	1
frugal	1
meal.	1
Susan's	1
father,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
supper	1
was	1
finished,	1
even	1
before	1
he	1
would	1
let	1
the	1
harper	1
play	1
a	1
tune	1
for	1
his	1
boys,	1
opened	1
the	1
little	1
purse,	1
which	1
Susan	1
had	1
given	1
him.	1
He	1
was	1
surprised	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
twelve	1
shillings,	1
and	1
still	1
more,	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
purse,	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
bright	1
golden	1
guinea.	1
"How	1
did	1
you	1
come	1
by	1
all	1
this	1
money,	1
Susan?"	1
said	1
he.	1
"Honestly	1
and	1
handsomely,	1
that	1
I'm	1
sure	1
of	1
beforehand,"	1
said	1
her	1
proud	1
mother;	1
"but	1
how	1
I	1
can't	1
make	1
out,	1
except	1
by	1
the	1
baking.	1
Hey,	1
Susan	1
is	1
this	1
your	1
first	1
baking?"	1
"Oh,	1
no,	1
no,"	1
said	1
her	1
father,	1
"I	1
have	1
her	1
first	1
baking	1
snug	1
here,	1
besides,	1
in	1
my	1
pocket.	1
I	1
kept	1
it	1
for	1
a	1
surprise,	1
to	1
do	1
your	1
mother's	1
heart	1
good,	1
Susan.	1
Here's	1
twenty-nine	1
shillings,	1
and	1
the	1
Abbey	1
bill,	1
which	1
is	1
not	1
paid	1
yet,	1
comes	1
to	1
ten	1
more.	1
What	1
think	1
you	1
of	1
this,	1
wife?	1
Have	1
we	1
not	1
a	1
right	1
to	1
be	1
proud	1
of	1
our	1
Susan?	1
Why,"	1
continued	1
he,	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
harper,	1
"I	1
ask	1
your	1
pardon	1
for	1
speaking	1
out	1
so	1
free	1
before	1
strangers	1
in	1
praise	1
of	1
my	1
own,	1
which	1
I	1
know	1
is	1
not	1
mannerly;	1
but	1
the	1
truth	1
is	1
the	1
fittest	1
thing	1
to	1
be	1
spoken,	1
as	1
I	1
think,	1
at	1
all	1
times;	1
therefore,	1
here's	1
your	1
good	1
health,	1
Susan;	1
why,	1
by-and-by	1
she'll	1
be	1
worth	1
her	1
weight	1
in	1
gold--in	1
silver	1
at	1
least.	1
But	1
tell	1
us,	1
child,	1
how	1
came	1
you	1
by	1
all	1
this	1
riches?	1
and	1
how	1
comes	1
it	1
that	1
I	1
don't	1
go	1
to-morrow?	1
All	1
this	1
happy	1
news	1
makes	1
me	1
so	1
gay	1
in	1
myself,	1
I'm	1
afraid	1
I	1
shall	1
hardly	1
understand	1
it	1
rightly.	1
But	1
speak	1
on,	1
child--first	1
bringing	1
us	1
a	1
bottle	1
of	1
the	1
good	1
mead	1
you	1
made	1
last	1
year	1
from	1
your	1
own	1
honey."	1
Susan	1
did	1
not	1
much	1
like	1
to	1
tell	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
her	1
guinea-hen--of	1
the	1
gown	1
and	1
of	1
her	1
poor	1
lamb.	1
Part	1
of	1
this	1
would	1
seem	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
was	1
vaunting	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
generosity,	1
and	1
part	1
of	1
it	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
to	1
recollect.	1
But	1
her	1
mother	1
pressed	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
whole,	1
and	1
she	1
related	1
it	1
as	1
simply	1
as	1
she	1
could.	1
When	1
she	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
her	1
lamb,	1
her	1
voice	1
faltered,	1
and	1
everybody	1
present	1
was	1
touched.	1
The	1
old	1
harper	1
sighed	1
once,	1
and	1
cleared	1
his	1
throat	1
several	1
times.	1
He	1
then	1
asked	1
for	1
his	1
harp,	1
and,	1
after	1
tuning	1
it	1
for	1
a	1
considerable	1
time,	1
he	1
recollected--for	1
he	1
had	1
often	1
fits	1
of	1
absence--that	1
he	1
sent	1
for	1
it	1
to	1
play	1
the	1
tune	1
he	1
had	1
promised	1
to	1
the	1
boys.	1
This	1
harper	1
came	1
from	1
a	1
great	1
distance,	1
from	1
the	1
mountains	1
of	1
Wales,	1
to	1
contend	1
with	1
several	1
other	1
competitors	1
for	1
a	1
prize,	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
advertised	1
by	1
a	1
musical	1
society	1
about	1
a	1
year	1
before	1
this	1
time.	1
There	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
splendid	1
ball	1
given	1
upon	1
the	1
occasion	1
at	1
Shrewsbury,	1
which	1
was	1
about	1
five	1
miles	1
from	1
our	1
village.	1
The	1
prize	1
was	1
ten	1
guineas	1
for	1
the	1
best	1
performer	1
on	1
the	1
harp,	1
and	1
the	1
prize	1
was	1
now	1
to	1
be	1
decided	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
days.	1
All	1
this	1
intelligence	1
Barbara	1
had	1
long	1
since	1
gained	1
from	1
her	1
maid,	1
who	1
often	1
paid	1
visits	1
to	1
the	1
town	1
of	1
Shrewsbury,	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
long	1
had	1
her	1
imagination	1
inflamed	1
with	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
this	1
splendid	1
music-meeting	1
and	1
ball.	1
Often	1
had	1
she	1
sighed	1
to	1
be	1
there,	1
and	1
often	1
had	1
she	1
revolved	1
in	1
her	1
mind	1
schemes	1
for	1
introducing	1
herself	1
to	1
some	1
GENTEEL	1
neighbours,	1
who	1
might	1
take	1
her	1
to	1
the	1
ball	1
IN	1
THEIR	1
CARRIAGE.	1
How	1
rejoiced,	1
how	1
triumphant	1
was	1
she,	1
when	1
this	1
very	1
evening,	1
just	1
about	1
the	1
time	1
when	1
the	1
butcher	1
was	1
bargaining	1
with	1
her	1
father	1
about	1
Susan's	1
lamb,	1
a	1
servant	1
from	1
the	1
Abbey	1
rapped	1
at	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
left	1
a	1
card	1
for	1
Mr.	1
and	1
Miss	1
Barbara	1
Case.	1
"There,"	1
cried	1
Bab,	1
"_I_	1
and	1
PAPA	1
are	1
to	1
dine	1
and	1
drink	1
tea	1
at	1
The	1
Abbey	1
tomorrow.	1
Who	1
knows?	1
I	1
daresay,	1
when	1
they	1
see	1
that	1
I'm	1
not	1
a	1
vulgar	1
person,	1
and	1
all	1
that;	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
go	1
cunningly	1
to	1
work	1
with	1
Miss	1
Somers,	1
as	1
I	1
shall,	1
to	1
be	1
sure,	1
I	1
daresay,	1
she'll	1
take	1
me	1
to	1
the	1
ball	1
with	1
her."	1
"To	1
be	1
sure,"	1
said	1
the	1
maid;	1
"it's	1
the	1
least	1
one	1
may	1
expect	1
from	1
a	1
lady	1
who	1
DEMEANS	1
herself	1
to	1
visit	1
Susan	1
Price,	1
and	1
goes	1
about	1
a-shopping	1
for	1
her.	1
The	1
least	1
she	1
can	1
do	1
for	1
you	1
is	1
to	1
take	1
you	1
in	1
her	1
carriage,	1
WHICH	1
costs	1
nothing,	1
but	1
is	1
just	1
a	1
common	1
civility,	1
to	1
a	1
ball."	1
"Then	1
pray,	1
Betty,"	1
continued	1
Miss	1
Barbara,	1
"don't	1
forget	1
to-morrow,	1
the	1
first	1
thing	1
you	1
do,	1
to	1
send	1
off	1
to	1
Shrewsbury	1
for	1
my	1
new	1
bonnet.	1
I	1
must	1
have	1
it	1
to	1
DINE	1
IN,	1
at	1
the	1
Abbey,	1
or	1
the	1
ladies	1
will	1
think	1
nothing	1
of	1
me;	1
and	1
Betty,	1
remember	1
the	1
mantua-maker	1
too.	1
I	1
must	1
see	1
and	1
coax	1
papa	1
to	1
buy	1
me	1
a	1
new	1
gown	1
against	1
the	1
ball.	1
I	1
can	1
see,	1
you	1
know,	1
something	1
of	1
the	1
fashions	1
to-morrow	1
at	1
the	1
Abbey.	1
I	1
shall	1
LOOK	1
THE	1
LADIES	1
WELL	1
OVER,	1
I	1
promise	1
you.	1
And,	1
Betty,	1
I	1
have	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
charming	1
present	1
for	1
Miss	1
Somers,	1
as	1
papa	1
says	1
it's	1
good	1
never	1
to	1
go	1
empty-handed	1
to	1
a	1
great	1
house,	1
I'll	1
make	1
Miss	1
Somers,	1
who	1
is	1
fond,	1
as	1
her	1
maid	1
told	1
you,	1
of	1
such	1
things--I'll	1
make	1
Miss	1
Somers	1
a	1
present	1
of	1
that	1
guinea-hen	1
of	1
Susan's;	1
it's	1
of	1
no	1
use	1
to	1
me,	1
so	1
do	1
you	1
carry	1
it	1
up	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
to	1
the	1
Abbey,	1
with	1
my	1
compliments.	1
That's	1
the	1
thing."	1
In	1
full	1
confidence	1
that	1
her	1
present	1
and	1
her	1
bonnet	1
would	1
operate	1
effectually	1
in	1
her	1
favour,	1
Miss	1
Barbara	1
paid	1
her	1
first	1
visit	1
at	1
the	1
Abbey.	1
She	1
expected	1
to	1
see	1
wonders.	1
She	1
was	1
dressed	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
finery	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
heard	1
from	1
her	1
maid,	1
who	1
had	1
heard	1
from	1
the	1
'prentice	1
of	1
a	1
Shrewsbury	1
milliner,	1
was	1
THE	1
THING	1
in	1
London;	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
much	1
surprised	1
and	1
disappointed,	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
shown	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
where	1
the	1
Miss	1
Somerses	1
and	1
the	1
ladies	1
of	1
the	1
Abbey	1
were	1
sitting,	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
not,	1
in	1
any	1
one	1
part	1
of	1
their	1
dress,	1
agree	1
with	1
the	1
picture	1
her	1
imagination	1
had	1
formed	1
of	1
fashionable	1
ladies.	1
She	1
was	1
embarrassed	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
books	1
and	1
work	1
and	1
drawings	1
upon	1
the	1
table,	1
and	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
some	1
affront	1
was	1
meant	1
to	1
her,	1
because	1
the	1
COMPANY	1
did	1
not	1
sit	1
with	1
their	1
hands	1
before	1
them.	1
When	1
Miss	1
Somers	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
conversation	1
that	1
would	1
interest	1
her,	1
and	1
spoke	1
of	1
walks	1
and	1
flowers	1
and	1
gardening,	1
of	1
which	1
she	1
was	1
herself	1
fond,	1
Miss	1
Barbara	1
still	1
thought	1
herself	1
undervalued,	1
and	1
soon	1
contrived	1
to	1
expose	1
her	1
ignorance	1
most	1
completely,	1
by	1
talking	1
of	1
things	1
which	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
understand.	1
Those	1
who	1
never	1
attempt	1
to	1
appear	1
what	1
they	1
are	1
not--those	1
who	1
do	1
not	1
in	1
their	1
manners	1
pretend	1
to	1
anything	1
unsuited	1
to	1
their	1
habits	1
and	1
situation	1
in	1
life,	1
never	1
are	1
in	1
danger	1
of	1
being	1
laughed	1
at	1
by	1
sensible,	1
well	1
bred	1
people	1
of	1
any	1
rank;	1
but	1
affectation	1
is	1
the	1
constant	1
and	1
just	1
object	1
of	1
ridicule.	1
Miss	1
Barbara	1
Case,	1
with	1
her	1
mistaken	1
airs	1
of	1
gentility,	1
aiming	1
to	1
be	1
thought	1
a	1
woman,	1
and	1
a	1
fine	1
lady,	1
whilst	1
she	1
was,	1
in	1
reality,	1
a	1
child	1
and	1
a	1
vulgar	1
attorney's	1
daughter,	1
rendered	1
herself	1
so	1
thoroughly	1
ridiculous,	1
that	1
the	1
good	1
natured,	1
yet	1
discerning	1
spectators	1
were	1
painfully	1
divided	1
between	1
their	1
sense	1
of	1
comic	1
absurdity	1
and	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
shame	1
for	1
one	1
who	1
could	1
feel	1
nothing	1
for	1
herself.	1
One	1
by	1
one	1
the	1
ladies	1
dropped	1
off.	1
Miss	1
Somers	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
to	1
alter	1
her	1
dress,	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
custom	1
of	1
the	1
family,	1
before	1
dinner.	1
She	1
left	1
a	1
portfolio	1
of	1
pretty	1
drawings	1
and	1
good	1
prints,	1
for	1
Miss	1
Barbara's	1
amusement;	1
but	1
Miss	1
Barbara's	1
thoughts	1
were	1
so	1
intent	1
upon	1
the	1
harpers'	1
ball,	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
entertained	1
with	1
such	1
TRIFLES.	1
How	1
unhappy	1
are	1
those	1
who	1
spend	1
their	1
time	1
in	1
expectation!	1
They	1
can	1
never	1
enjoy	1
the	1
present	1
moment.	1
Whilst	1
Barbara	1
was	1
contriving	1
means	1
of	1
interesting	1
Miss	1
Somers	1
in	1
her	1
favour,	1
she	1
recollected,	1
with	1
surprise,	1
that	1
not	1
one	1
word	1
had	1
yet	1
been	1
said	1
of	1
her	1
present	1
of	1
the	1
guinea-hen.	1
Mrs.	1
Betty,	1
in	1
the	1
hurry	1
of	1
her	1
dressing	1
her	1
young	1
lady	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
had	1
forgotten	1
it;	1
but	1
it	1
came	1
just	1
whilst	1
Miss	1
Somers	1
was	1
dressing;	1
and	1
the	1
housekeeper	1
came	1
into	1
her	1
mistress'	1
room	1
to	1
announce	1
its	1
arrival.	1
"Ma'am,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"here's	1
a	1
beautiful	1
guinea-hen	1
just	1
come,	1
with	1
Miss	1
Barbara	1
Case's	1
compliments	1
to	1
you."	1
Miss	1
Somers	1
knew,	1
by	1
the	1
tone	1
which	1
the	1
housekeeper	1
delivered	1
this	1
message,	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
in	1
the	1
business	1
which	1
did	1
not	1
perfectly	1
please	1
her.	1
She	1
made	1
no	1
answer,	1
in	1
expectation	1
that	1
the	1
housekeeper,	1
who	1
was	1
a	1
woman	1
of	1
a	1
very	1
open	1
temper,	1
would	1
explain	1
her	1
cause	1
of	1
dissatisfaction.	1
In	1
this	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
mistaken.	1
The	1
housekeeper	1
came	1
close	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
dressing	1
table,	1
and	1
continued,	1
"I	1
never	1
like	1
to	1
speak	1
till	1
I'm	1
sure,	1
ma'am,	1
and	1
I'm	1
not	1
quite	1
sure,	1
to	1
say	1
certain,	1
in	1
this	1
case,	1
ma'am,	1
but	1
still	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
right	1
to	1
tell	1
you,	1
which	1
can't	1
wrong	1
anybody,	1
what	1
came	1
across	1
my	1
mind	1
about	1
this	1
same	1
guinea-hen,	1
ma'am;	1
and	1
you	1
can	1
inquire	1
into	1
it,	1
and	1
do	1
as	1
you	1
please	1
afterwards,	1
ma'am.	1
Some	1
time	1
ago	1
we	1
had	1
fine	1
guinea-fowls	1
of	1
our	1
own,	1
and	1
I	1
made	1
bold,	1
not	1
thinking,	1
to	1
be	1
sure,	1
that	1
all	1
our	1
own	1
would	1
die	1
away	1
from	1
us,	1
as	1
they	1
have	1
done,	1
to	1
give	1
a	1
fine	1
couple	1
last	1
Christmas	1
to	1
Susan	1
Price,	1
and	1
very	1
fond	1
and	1
pleased	1
she	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
time,	1
and	1
I'm	1
sure	1
would	1
never	1
have	1
parted	1
with	1
the	1
hen	1
with	1
her	1
good-will;	1
but	1
if	1
my	1
eyes	1
don't	1
strangely	1
mistake,	1
this	1
hen,	1
that	1
comes	1
from	1
Miss	1
Barbara,	1
is	1
the	1
selfsame	1
identical	1
guinea-hen	1
that	1
I	1
gave	1
to	1
Susan.	1
And	1
how	1
Miss	1
Bab	1
came	1
by	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
thing	1
that	1
puzzles	1
me.	1
If	1
my	1
boy	1
Philip	1
was	1
at	1
home,	1
maybe,	1
as	1
he's	1
often	1
at	1
Mrs.	1
Price's	1
(which	1
I	1
don't	1
disapprove),	1
he	1
might	1
know	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
the	1
guinea-hen.	1
I	1
expect	1
him	1
home	1
this	1
night,	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
have	1
no	1
objection,	1
I	1
will	1
sift	1
the	1
affair."	1
"The	1
shortest	1
way,	1
I	1
think,"	1
said	1
Henrietta,	1
"would	1
be	1
to	1
ask	1
Miss	1
Case	1
herself	1
about	1
it,	1
which	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
this	1
evening."	1
"If	1
you	1
please,	1
ma'am,"	1
said	1
the	1
housekeeper,	1
coldly;	1
for	1
she	1
knew	1
that	1
Miss	1
Barbara	1
was	1
not	1
famous	1
in	1
the	1
village	1
for	1
speaking	1
truth.	1
Dinner	1
was	1
now	1
served.	1
Attorney	1
Case	1
expected	1
to	1
smell	1
mint	1
sauce,	1
and,	1
as	1
the	1
covers	1
were	1
taken	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
dishes,	1
looked	1
around	1
for	1
lamb;	1
but	1
no	1
lamb	1
appeared.	1
He	1
had	1
a	1
dexterous	1
knack	1
of	1
twisting	1
the	1
conversation	1
to	1
his	1
point.	1
Sir	1
Arthur	1
was	1
speaking,	1
when	1
they	1
sat	1
down	1
to	1
dinner,	1
of	1
a	1
new	1
carving	1
knife,	1
which	1
he	1
lately	1
had	1
had	1
made	1
for	1
his	1
sister.	1
The	1
attorney	1
immediately	1
went	1
from	1
carving-knives	1
to	1
poultry;	1
thence	1
to	1
butcher's	1
meat.	1
Some	1
joints,	1
he	1
observed,	1
were	1
much	1
more	1
difficult	1
to	1
carve	1
than	1
others.	1
He	1
never	1
saw	1
a	1
man	1
carve	1
better	1
than	1
the	1
gentleman	1
opposite	1
him,	1
who	1
was	1
the	1
curate	1
of	1
the	1
parish.	1
"But,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
the	1
vulgar	1
attorney,	1
"I	1
must	1
make	1
bold	1
to	1
differ	1
with	1
you	1
in	1
one	1
point,	1
and	1
I'll	1
appeal	1
to	1
Sir	1
Arthur.	1
Sir	1
Arthur,	1
pray	1
may	1
I	1
ask,	1
when	1
you	1
carve	1
a	1
forequarter	1
of	1
lamb,	1
do	1
you,	1
when	1
you	1
raise	1
the	1
shoulder,	1
throw	1
in	1
salt,	1
or	1
not?"	1
This	1
well	1
prepared	1
question	1
was	1
not	1
lost	1
upon	1
Sir	1
Arthur.	1
The	1
attorney	1
was	1
thanked	1
for	1
his	1
intended	1
present;	1
but	1
mortified	1
and	1
surprised	1
to	1
hear	1
Sir	1
Arthur	1
say	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
constant	1
rule	1
of	1
his	1
never	1
to	1
accept	1
of	1
any	1
presents	1
from	1
his	1
neighbours.	1
"If	1
we	1
were	1
to	1
accept	1
a	1
lamb	1
from	1
a	1
rich	1
neighbour	1
on	1
my	1
estate,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"I	1
am	1
afraid	1
we	1
should	1
mortify	1
many	1
of	1
our	1
poor	1
tenants,	1
who	1
can	1
have	1
little	1
to	1
offer,	1
though,	1
perhaps,	1
they	1
may	1
bear	1
us	1
thorough	1
good-will	1
notwithstanding."	1
After	1
the	1
ladies	1
left	1
the	1
dining-room,	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
walking	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
large	1
hall,	1
Miss	1
Barbara	1
had	1
a	1
fair	1
opportunity	1
of	1
imitating	1
her	1
keen	1
father's	1
method	1
of	1
conversing.	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
ladies	1
observed,	1
that	1
this	1
hall	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
charming	1
place	1
for	1
music.	1
Bab	1
brought	1
in	1
harps	1
and	1
harpers,	1
and	1
the	1
harpers'	1
ball,	1
in	1
a	1
breath.	1
"I	1
know	1
so	1
much	1
about	1
it,--	1
about	1
the	1
ball	1
I	1
mean,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"because	1
a	1
lady	1
in	1
Shrewsbury,	1
a	1
friend	1
of	1
papa's,	1
offered	1
to	1
take	1
me	1
with	1
her;	1
but	1
papa	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
to	1
give	1
her	1
the	1
trouble	1
of	1
sending	1
so	1
far	1
for	1
me,	1
though	1
she	1
has	1
a	1
coach	1
of	1
her	1
own."	1
Barbara	1
fixed	1
her	1
eyes	1
upon	1
Miss	1
Somers	1
as	1
she	1
spoke;	1
but	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
read	1
her	1
countenance	1
as	1
distinctly	1
as	1
she	1
wished,	1
because	1
Miss	1
Somers	1
was	1
at	1
this	1
moment	1
letting	1
down	1
the	1
veil	1
of	1
her	1
hat.	1
"Shall	1
we	1
walk	1
out	1
before	1
tea?"	1
said	1
Miss	1
Somers	1
to	1
her	1
companions;	1
"I	1
have	1
a	1
pretty	1
guinea-hen	1
to	1
show	1
you."	1
Barbara,	1
secretly	1
drawing	1
propitious	1
omens	1
from	1
the	1
guinea-hen,	1
followed	1
with	1
a	1
confidential	1
step.	1
The	1
pheasantry	1
was	1
well	1
filled	1
with	1
pheasants,	1
peacocks,	1
etc.,	1
and	1
Susan's	1
pretty	1
little	1
guinea-hen	1
appeared	1
well,	1
even	1
in	1
this	1
high	1
company.	1
It	1
was	1
much	1
admired.	1
Barbara	1
was	1
in	1
glory;	1
but	1
her	1
glory	1
was	1
of	1
short	1
duration.	1
Just	1
as	1
Miss	1
Somers	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
inquire	1
into	1
the	1
guinea-hen's	1
history,	1
Philip	1
came	1
up,	1
to	1
ask	1
permission	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
sycamore,	1
to	1
turn	1
a	1
nutmeg	1
box	1
for	1
his	1
mother.	1
He	1
was	1
an	1
ingenious	1
lad,	1
and	1
a	1
good	1
turner	1
for	1
his	1
age.	1
Sir	1
Arthur	1
had	1
put	1
by	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
sycamore,	1
on	1
purpose	1
for	1
him;	1
and	1
Miss	1
Somers	1
told	1
him	1
where	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
found.	1
He	1
thanked	1
her:	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
his	1
bow	1
of	1
thanks	1
his	1
eye	1
was	1
struck	1
by	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
guinea-hen,	1
and	1
he	1
involuntarily	1
exclaimed,	1
"Susan's	1
guinea-hen,	1
I	1
declare!"	1
"No,	1
it's	1
not	1
Susan's	1
guinea-hen,"	1
said	1
Miss	1
Barbara,	1
colouring	1
furiously;	1
"it	1
is	1
mine,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
a	1
present	1
of	1
it	1
to	1
Miss	1
Somers."	1
At	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
Bab's	1
voice,	1
Philip	1
turned--saw	1
her--and	1
indignation,	1
unrestrained	1
by	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
amazed	1
spectators,	1
flashed	1
in	1
his	1
countenance.	1
"What	1
is	1
the	1
matter,	1
Philip?"	1
said	1
Miss	1
Somers,	1
in	1
a	1
pacifying	1
tone;	1
but	1
Philip	1
was	1
not	1
inclined	1
to	1
be	1
pacified.	1
"Why,	1
ma'am,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"may	1
I	1
speak	1
out?"	1
and,	1
without	1
waiting	1
for	1
permission,	1
he	1
spoke	1
out,	1
and	1
gave	1
a	1
full,	1
true,	1
and	1
warm	1
account	1
of	1
Rose's	1
embassy,	1
and	1
of	1
Miss	1
Barbara's	1
cruel	1
and	1
avaricious	1
proceedings.	1
Barbara	1
denied,	1
prevaricated,	1
stammered,	1
and	1
at	1
last	1
was	1
overcome	1
with	1
confusion;	1
for	1
which	1
even	1
the	1
most	1
indulgent	1
spectators	1
could	1
scarcely	1
pity	1
her.	1
Miss	1
Somers,	1
however,	1
mindful	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
due	1
to	1
her	1
guest,	1
was	1
anxious	1
to	1
dispatch	1
Philip	1
for	1
his	1
piece	1
of	1
sycamore.	1
Bab	1
recovered	1
herself	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
out	1
of	1
sight;	1
but	1
she	1
further	1
exposed	1
herself	1
by	1
exclaiming,	1
"I'm	1
sure	1
I	1
wish	1
this	1
pitiful	1
guinea-hen	1
had	1
never	1
come	1
into	1
my	1
possession.	1
I	1
wish	1
Susan	1
had	1
kept	1
it	1
at	1
home,	1
as	1
she	1
should	1
have	1
done!"	1
"Perhaps	1
she	1
will	1
be	1
more	1
careful	1
now	1
that	1
she	1
has	1
received	1
so	1
strong	1
a	1
lesson,"	1
said	1
Miss	1
Somers.	1
"Shall	1
we	1
try	1
her?"	1
continued	1
she.	1
"Philip	1
will,	1
I	1
daresay,	1
take	1
the	1
guinea-hen	1
back	1
to	1
Susan,	1
if	1
we	1
desire	1
it."	1
"If	1
you	1
please,	1
ma'am,"	1
said	1
Barbara,	1
sullenly;	1
"I	1
have	1
nothing	1
more	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
it."	1
So	1
the	1
guinea-hen	1
was	1
delivered	1
to	1
Philip,	1
who	1
set	1
off	1
joyfully	1
with	1
his	1
prize,	1
and	1
was	1
soon	1
in	1
sight	1
of	1
Farmer	1
Price's	1
cottage.	1
He	1
stopped	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
door.	1
He	1
recollected	1
Rose	1
and	1
her	1
generous	1
friendship	1
for	1
Susan.	1
He	1
was	1
determined	1
that	1
she	1
should	1
have	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
restoring	1
the	1
guinea-hen.	1
He	1
ran	1
into	1
the	1
village.	1
All	1
the	1
children	1
who	1
had	1
given	1
up	1
their	1
little	1
purse	1
on	1
May	1
day	1
were	1
assembled	1
on	1
the	1
play-green.	1
They	1
were	1
delighted	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
guinea-hen	1
once	1
more.	1
Philip	1
took	1
his	1
pipe	1
and	1
tabor,	1
and	1
they	1
marched	1
in	1
innocent	1
triumph	1
towards	1
the	1
whitewashed	1
cottage.	1
"Let	1
me	1
come	1
with	1
you--let	1
me	1
come	1
with	1
you,"	1
said	1
the	1
butcher's	1
boy	1
to	1
Philip.	1
"Stop	1
one	1
minute!	1
my	1
father	1
has	1
something	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
you."	1
He	1
darted	1
into	1
his	1
father's	1
house.	1
The	1
little	1
procession	1
stopped,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
the	1
bleating	1
of	1
a	1
lamb	1
was	1
heard.	1
Through	1
a	1
back	1
passage,	1
which	1
led	1
into	1
the	1
paddock	1
behind	1
the	1
house,	1
they	1
saw	1
the	1
butcher	1
leading	1
a	1
lamb.	1
"It	1
is	1
Daisy!"	1
exclaimed	1
Rose--"It's	1
Daisy!"	1
repeated	1
all	1
her	1
companions.	1
"Susan's	1
lamb!	1
Susan's	1
lamb!"	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
universal	1
shout	1
of	1
joy.	1
"Well,	1
for	1
my	1
part,"	1
said	1
the	1
good	1
butcher,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
be	1
heard,--"for	1
my	1
part,	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
so	1
cruel	1
as	1
Attorney	1
Case	1
for	1
the	1
whole	1
world.	1
These	1
poor	1
brute	1
beasts	1
don't	1
know	1
aforehand	1
what's	1
going	1
to	1
happen	1
to	1
them;	1
and	1
as	1
for	1
dying,	1
it's	1
what	1
we	1
must	1
all	1
do	1
some	1
time	1
or	1
another;	1
but	1
to	1
keep	1
wringing	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
the	1
living,	1
that	1
have	1
as	1
much	1
sense	1
as	1
one's	1
self,	1
is	1
what	1
I	1
call	1
cruel;	1
and	1
is	1
not	1
this	1
what	1
Attorney	1
Case	1
has	1
been	1
doing	1
by	1
poor	1
Susan	1
and	1
her	1
whole	1
family,	1
ever	1
since	1
he	1
took	1
a	1
spite	1
against	1
them?	1
But,	1
at	1
anyrate,	1
here's	1
Susan's	1
lamb	1
safe	1
and	1
sound.	1
I'd	1
have	1
taken	1
it	1
back	1
sooner,	1
but	1
I	1
was	1
off	1
before	1
day	1
to	1
the	1
fair,	1
and	1
am	1
but	1
just	1
come	1
back.	1
Daisy,	1
however,	1
has	1
been	1
as	1
well	1
off	1
in	1
my	1
paddock	1
as	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
field	1
by	1
the	1
waterside."	1
The	1
obliging	1
shopkeeper,	1
who	1
showed	1
the	1
pretty	1
calicoes	1
to	1
Susan,	1
was	1
now	1
at	1
his	1
door,	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
lamb,	1
and	1
heard	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
Susan's,	1
and	1
learned	1
its	1
history,	1
he	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
add	1
his	1
mite;	1
and	1
he	1
gave	1
the	1
children	1
some	1
ends	1
of	1
narrow	1
riband,	1
with	1
which	1
Rose	1
decorated	1
her	1
friend's	1
lamb.	1
The	1
pipe	1
and	1
tabor	1
now	1
once	1
more	1
began	1
to	1
play,	1
and	1
the	1
procession	1
moved	1
on	1
in	1
joyful	1
order,	1
after	1
giving	1
the	1
humane	1
butcher	1
three	1
cheers;	1
three	1
cheers	1
which	1
were	1
better	1
deserved	1
than	1
"loud	1
huzzas"	1
usually	1
are.	1
Susan	1
was	1
working	1
in	1
her	1
arbour,	1
with	1
her	1
little	1
deal	1
table	1
before	1
her.	1
When	1
she	1
heard	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
music,	1
she	1
put	1
down	1
her	1
work	1
and	1
listened.	1
She	1
saw	1
the	1
crowd	1
of	1
children	1
coming	1
nearer	1
and	1
nearer.	1
They	1
had	1
closed	1
round	1
Daisy,	1
so	1
that	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
it;	1
but	1
as	1
they	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
garden	1
gate	1
she	1
saw	1
that	1
Rose	1
beckoned	1
to	1
her.	1
Philip	1
played	1
as	1
loud	1
as	1
he	1
could,	1
that	1
she	1
might	1
not	1
hear,	1
till	1
the	1
proper	1
moment,	1
the	1
bleating	1
of	1
the	1
lamb.	1
Susan	1
opened	1
the	1
garden-wicket,	1
and	1
at	1
this	1
signal	1
the	1
crowd	1
divided,	1
and	1
the	1
first	1
thing	1
that	1
Susan	1
saw,	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
her	1
taller	1
friends,	1
was	1
little	1
smiling	1
Mary,	1
with	1
the	1
guinea-hen	1
in	1
her	1
arms.	1
"Come	1
on!	1
Come	1
on!"	1
cried	1
Mary,	1
as	1
Susan	1
started	1
with	1
joyful	1
surprise;	1
"you	1
have	1
more	1
to	1
see."	1
At	1
this	1
instant	1
the	1
music	1
paused,	1
Susan	1
heard	1
the	1
bleating	1
of	1
a	1
lamb,	1
and	1
scarcely	1
daring	1
to	1
believe	1
her	1
senses,	1
she	1
pressed	1
eagerly	1
forward,	1
and	1
beheld	1
poor	1
Daisy!--she	1
burst	1
into	1
tears.	1
"I	1
did	1
not	1
shed	1
one	1
tear	1
when	1
I	1
parted	1
with	1
you,	1
my	1
dear	1
little	1
Daisy!"	1
said	1
she.	1
"It	1
was	1
for	1
my	1
father	1
and	1
mother.	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
parted	1
with	1
you	1
for	1
anything	1
else	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
world.	1
Thank	1
you,	1
thank	1
you	1
all,"	1
added	1
she,	1
to	1
her	1
companions,	1
who	1
sympathized	1
in	1
her	1
joy,	1
even	1
more	1
than	1
they	1
had	1
sympathized	1
in	1
her	1
sorrow.	1
"Now,	1
if	1
my	1
father	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
go	1
away	1
from	1
us	1
next	1
week,	1
and	1
if	1
my	1
mother	1
was	1
quite	1
stout,	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
the	1
happiest	1
person	1
in	1
the	1
world!"	1
As	1
Susan	1
pronounced	1
these	1
words,	1
a	1
voice	1
behind	1
the	1
little	1
listening	1
crowd	1
cried,	1
in	1
a	1
brutal	1
tone,	1
"Let	1
us	1
pass,	1
if	1
you	1
please;	1
you	1
have	1
no	1
right	1
to	1
stop	1
up	1
the	1
public	1
road!"	1
This	1
was	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
Attorney	1
Case,	1
who	1
was	1
returning	1
with	1
his	1
daughter	1
Barbara	1
from	1
his	1
visit	1
to	1
the	1
Abbey.	1
He	1
saw	1
the	1
lamb,	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
whistle	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
on.	1
Barbara	1
also	1
saw	1
the	1
guinea-hen,	1
and	1
turned	1
her	1
head	1
another	1
way,	1
that	1
she	1
might	1
avoid	1
the	1
contemptuous,	1
reproachful	1
looks	1
of	1
those	1
whom	1
she	1
only	1
affected	1
to	1
despise.	1
Even	1
her	1
new	1
bonnet,	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
expected	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
much	1
admired,	1
was	1
now	1
only	1
serviceable	1
to	1
hide	1
her	1
face	1
and	1
conceal	1
her	1
mortification.	1
"I	1
am	1
glad	1
she	1
saw	1
the	1
guinea-hen,"	1
cried	1
Rose,	1
who	1
now	1
held	1
it	1
in	1
her	1
hands.	1
"Yes,"	1
said	1
Philip,	1
"she'll	1
not	1
forget	1
May	1
day	1
in	1
a	1
hurry."	1
"Nor	1
I	1
neither,	1
I	1
hope,"	1
said	1
Susan,	1
looking	1
round	1
upon	1
her	1
companions	1
with	1
a	1
most	1
affectionate	1
smile:	1
"I	1
hope,	1
whilst	1
I	1
live,	1
I	1
shall	1
never	1
forget	1
your	1
goodness	1
to	1
me	1
last	1
May	1
day.	1
Now	1
I've	1
my	1
pretty	1
guinea-hen	1
safe	1
once	1
more,	1
I	1
should	1
think	1
of	1
returning	1
your	1
money."	1
"No!	1
no!	1
no!"	1
was	1
the	1
general	1
cry.	1
"We	1
don't	1
want	1
the	1
money--keep	1
it,	1
keep	1
it--you	1
want	1
it	1
for	1
your	1
father."	1
"Well,"	1
said	1
Susan,	1
"I	1
am	1
not	1
too	1
proud	1
to	1
be	1
obliged.	1
I	1
WILL	1
keep	1
your	1
money	1
for	1
my	1
father.	1
Perhaps	1
some	1
time	1
or	1
other	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
earn--"	1
"Oh,"	1
interrupted	1
Philip,	1
"don't	1
let	1
us	1
talk	1
of	1
earning;	1
don't	1
let	1
us	1
talk	1
to	1
her	1
of	1
money	1
now;	1
she	1
has	1
not	1
had	1
time	1
hardly	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
poor	1
Daisy	1
and	1
her	1
guinea-hen.	1
Come,	1
we	1
must	1
go	1
about	1
our	1
business,	1
and	1
let	1
her	1
have	1
them	1
all	1
to	1
herself."	1
The	1
crowd	1
moved	1
away	1
in	1
consequence	1
of	1
Philip's	1
considerate	1
advice:	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
observed	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
very	1
last	1
to	1
stir	1
from	1
the	1
garden-wicket	1
himself.	1
He	1
stayed,	1
first,	1
to	1
inform	1
Susan	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
Rose	1
who	1
tied	1
the	1
ribands	1
on	1
Daisy's	1
head.	1
Then	1
he	1
stayed	1
a	1
little	1
longer	1
to	1
let	1
her	1
into	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
the	1
guinea-hen,	1
and	1
to	1
tell	1
her	1
who	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
brought	1
the	1
hen	1
home	1
from	1
the	1
Abbey.	1
Rose	1
held	1
the	1
sieve,	1
and	1
Susan	1
was	1
feeding	1
her	1
long	1
lost	1
favourite,	1
whilst	1
Philip	1
leaned	1
over	1
the	1
wicket,	1
prolonging	1
his	1
narration.	1
"Now,	1
my	1
pretty	1
guinea-hen,"	1
said	1
Susan--"my	1
naughty	1
guinea-hen,	1
that	1
flew	1
away	1
from	1
me,	1
you	1
shall	1
never	1
serve	1
me	1
so	1
again.	1
I	1
must	1
cut	1
your	1
nice	1
wings;	1
but	1
I	1
won't	1
hurt	1
you."	1
"Take	1
care,"	1
cried	1
Philip;	1
"you'd	1
better,	1
indeed	1
you'd	1
better	1
let	1
me	1
hold	1
her	1
whilst	1
you	1
cut	1
her	1
wings."	1
When	1
this	1
operation	1
was	1
successfully	1
performed,	1
which	1
it	1
certainly	1
could	1
never	1
have	1
been	1
if	1
Philip	1
had	1
not	1
held	1
the	1
hen	1
for	1
Susan,	1
he	1
recollected	1
that	1
his	1
mother	1
had	1
sent	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
message	1
to	1
Mrs.	1
Price.	1
This	1
message	1
led	1
to	1
another	1
quarter	1
of	1
an	1
hour's	1
delay;	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
whole	1
history	1
of	1
the	1
guinea-hen	1
to	1
tell	1
over	1
again	1
to	1
Mrs.	1
Price,	1
and	1
the	1
farmer	1
himself	1
luckily	1
came	1
in	1
whilst	1
it	1
was	1
going	1
on,	1
so	1
it	1
was	1
but	1
civil	1
to	1
begin	1
it	1
afresh;	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
farmer	1
was	1
so	1
rejoiced	1
to	1
see	1
his	1
Susan	1
so	1
happy	1
again	1
with	1
her	1
two	1
little	1
favourites	1
that	1
he	1
declared	1
he	1
must	1
see	1
Daisy	1
fed	1
himself;	1
and	1
Philip	1
found	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
wanted	1
to	1
hold	1
the	1
jug	1
full	1
of	1
milk,	1
out	1
of	1
which	1
Farmer	1
Price	1
filled	1
the	1
pan	1
for	1
Daisy?	1
Happy	1
Daisy!	1
who	1
lapped	1
at	1
his	1
ease,	1
whilst	1
Susan	1
caressed	1
him,	1
and	1
thanked	1
her	1
fond	1
father	1
and	1
her	1
pleased	1
mother.	1
"But,	1
Philip,"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Price,	1
"I'll	1
hold	1
the	1
jug--you'll	1
be	1
late	1
with	1
your	1
message	1
to	1
your	1
mother;	1
we'll	1
not	1
detain	1
you	1
any	1
longer."	1
Philip	1
departed,	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
garden-wicket,	1
he	1
looked	1
up,	1
and	1
saw	1
Bab	1
and	1
her	1
maid	1
Betty	1
staring	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window,	1
as	1
usual.	1
On	1
this,	1
he	1
immediately	1
turned	1
back	1
to	1
try	1
whether	1
he	1
had	1
shut	1
the	1
gate	1
fast,	1
lest	1
the	1
guinea-hen	1
might	1
stray	1
out,	1
and	1
fall	1
again	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
enemy.	1
Miss	1
Barbara,	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
this	1
day,	1
felt	1
considerable	1
mortification,	1
but	1
no	1
contrition.	1
She	1
was	1
vexed	1
that	1
her	1
meanness	1
was	1
discovered,	1
but	1
she	1
felt	1
no	1
desire	1
to	1
cure	1
herself	1
of	1
any	1
of	1
her	1
faults.	1
The	1
ball	1
was	1
still	1
uppermost	1
in	1
her	1
vain,	1
selfish	1
soul.	1
"Well,"	1
said	1
she	1
to	1
her	1
confidante,	1
Betty,	1
"you	1
hear	1
how	1
things	1
have	1
turned	1
out;	1
but	1
if	1
Miss	1
Somers	1
won't	1
think	1
of	1
asking	1
me	1
to	1
go	1
out	1
with	1
her,	1
I've	1
a	1
notion	1
I	1
know	1
who	1
will.	1
As	1
papa	1
says,	1
it's	1
a	1
good	1
thing	1
to	1
have	1
two	1
strings	1
to	1
one's	1
bow."	1
Now,	1
some	1
officers,	1
who	1
were	1
quartered	1
at	1
Shrewsbury,	1
had	1
become	1
acquainted	1
with	1
Mr.	1
Case.	1
They	1
had	1
gotten	1
into	1
some	1
quarrel	1
with	1
a	1
tradesman	1
of	1
the	1
town,	1
and	1
Attorney	1
Case	1
had	1
promised	1
to	1
bring	1
them	1
through	1
the	1
affair,	1
as	1
the	1
man	1
threatened	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
them.	1
Upon	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
this	1
promise,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
vain	1
hope	1
that,	1
by	1
civility,	1
they	1
might	1
dispose	1
him	1
to	1
bring	1
in	1
a	1
REASONABLE	1
bill	1
of	1
costs,	1
these	1
officers	1
sometimes	1
invited	1
Mr.	1
Case	1
to	1
the	1
mess;	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
them,	1
who	1
had	1
lately	1
been	1
married,	1
prevailed	1
upon	1
his	1
bride	1
SOMETIMES	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
little	1
notice	1
of	1
Miss	1
Barbara.	1
It	1
was	1
with	1
this	1
lady	1
that	1
Miss	1
Barbara	1
now	1
hoped	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
harpers'	1
ball.	1
"The	1
officers	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Strathspey,	1
or,	1
more	1
properly,	1
Mrs.	1
Strathspey	1
and	1
the	1
officers,	1
are	1
to	1
breakfast	1
here,	1
tomorrow,	1
do	1
you	1
know,"	1
said	1
Bab	1
to	1
Betty.	1
"One	1
of	1
them	1
dined	1
at	1
the	1
Abbey,	1
to-day,	1
and	1
told	1
papa	1
that	1
they'd	1
all	1
come.	1
They	1
are	1
going	1
out	1
on	1
a	1
party,	1
somewhere	1
into	1
the	1
country,	1
and	1
breakfast	1
here	1
on	1
their	1
way.	1
Pray,	1
Betty,	1
don't	1
forget	1
that	1
Mrs.	1
Strathspey	1
can't	1
breakfast	1
without	1
honey.	1
I	1
heard	1
her	1
say	1
so	1
myself."	1
"Then,	1
indeed,"	1
said	1
Betty,	1
"I'm	1
afraid	1
Mrs.	1
Strathspey	1
will	1
be	1
likely	1
to	1
go	1
without	1
her	1
breakfast	1
here;	1
for	1
not	1
a	1
spoonful	1
of	1
honey	1
have	1
we,	1
let	1
her	1
long	1
for	1
it	1
ever	1
so	1
much."	1
"But,	1
surely,"	1
said	1
Bab,	1
"we	1
can	1
contrive	1
to	1
get	1
some	1
honey	1
in	1
the	1
neighbourhood."	1
"There's	1
none	1
to	1
be	1
bought,	1
as	1
I	1
know	1
of,"	1
said	1
Betty.	1
"But	1
is	1
there	1
none	1
to	1
be	1
begged	1
or	1
borrowed?"	1
said	1
Bab,	1
laughing.	1
"Do	1
you	1
forget	1
Susan's	1
beehive?	1
Step	1
over	1
to	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
with	1
MY	1
COMPLIMENTS,	1
and	1
see	1
what	1
you	1
can	1
do.	1
Tell	1
her	1
it's	1
for	1
Mrs.	1
Strathspey."	1
In	1
the	1
morning	1
Betty	1
went	1
with	1
Miss	1
Barbara's	1
compliments	1
to	1
Susan,	1
to	1
beg	1
some	1
honey	1
for	1
Mrs.	1
Strathspey,	1
who	1
could	1
not	1
breakfast	1
without	1
it.	1
Susan	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
to	1
part	1
with	1
her	1
honey,	1
because	1
her	1
mother	1
loved	1
it,	1
and	1
she	1
therefore	1
gave	1
Betty	1
but	1
a	1
small	1
quantity.	1
When	1
Barbara	1
saw	1
how	1
little	1
Susan	1
sent,	1
she	1
called	1
her	1
A	1
MISER,	1
and	1
she	1
said	1
she	1
MUST	1
have	1
some	1
more	1
for	1
Mrs.	1
Strathspey.	1
"I'll	1
go	1
myself	1
and	1
speak	1
to	1
her.	1
Come	1
with	1
me,	1
Betty,"	1
said	1
the	1
young	1
lady,	1
who	1
found	1
it	1
at	1
present	1
convenient	1
to	1
forget	1
her	1
having	1
declared,	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
she	1
sucked	1
up	1
the	1
broth,	1
that	1
she	1
never	1
would	1
honour	1
Susan	1
with	1
another	1
visit.	1
"Susan,"	1
said	1
she,	1
accosting	1
the	1
poor	1
girl,	1
whom	1
she	1
had	1
done	1
everything	1
in	1
her	1
power	1
to	1
injure,	1
"I	1
must	1
beg	1
a	1
little	1
more	1
honey	1
from	1
you	1
for	1
Mrs.	1
Strathspey's	1
breakfast.	1
You	1
know,	1
on	1
a	1
particular	1
occasion	1
such	1
as	1
this,	1
neighbours	1
must	1
help	1
one	1
another."	1
"To	1
be	1
sure	1
they	1
should,"	1
added	1
Betty.	1
Susan,	1
though	1
she	1
was	1
generous,	1
was	1
not	1
weak;	1
she	1
was	1
willing	1
to	1
give	1
to	1
those	1
she	1
loved,	1
but	1
not	1
disposed	1
to	1
let	1
anything	1
be	1
taken	1
from	1
her,	1
or	1
coaxed	1
out	1
of	1
her,	1
by	1
those	1
she	1
had	1
reason	1
to	1
despise.	1
She	1
civilly	1
answered,	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
sorry	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
more	1
honey	1
to	1
spare.	1
Barbara	1
grew	1
angry,	1
and	1
lost	1
all	1
command	1
of	1
herself,	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
that	1
Susan,	1
without	1
regarding	1
her	1
reproaches,	1
went	1
on	1
looking	1
through	1
the	1
glass	1
pane	1
in	1
the	1
beehive.	1
"I'll	1
tell	1
you	1
what,	1
Susan	1
Price,"	1
said	1
she,	1
in	1
a	1
high	1
tone,	1
"the	1
honey	1
I	1
WILL	1
have,	1
so	1
you	1
may	1
as	1
well	1
give	1
it	1
to	1
me	1
by	1
fair	1
means.	1
Yes	1
or	1
no!	1
Speak!	1
Will	1
you	1
give	1
it	1
me	1
or	1
not?	1
Will	1
you	1
give	1
me	1
that	1
piece	1
of	1
the	1
honey-comb	1
that	1
lies	1
there?"	1
"That	1
bit	1
of	1
honey-comb	1
is	1
for	1
my	1
mother's	1
breakfast,"	1
said	1
Susan;	1
"I	1
cannot	1
give	1
it	1
you."	1
"Can't	1
you?"	1
said	1
Bab,	1
"then	1
see	1
if	1
I	1
don't	1
take	1
it!"	1
She	1
stretched	1
across	1
Susan	1
for	1
the	1
honey-comb,	1
which	1
was	1
lying	1
by	1
some	1
rosemary	1
leaves	1
that	1
Susan	1
had	1
freshly	1
gathered	1
for	1
her	1
mother's	1
tea.	1
Bab	1
grasped,	1
but	1
at	1
her	1
first	1
effort	1
she	1
only	1
reached	1
the	1
rosemary.	1
She	1
made	1
a	1
second	1
dart	1
at	1
the	1
honey-comb,	1
and,	1
in	1
her	1
struggle	1
to	1
obtain	1
it,	1
she	1
overset	1
the	1
beehive.	1
The	1
bees	1
swarmed	1
about	1
her.	1
Her	1
maid	1
Betty	1
screamed	1
and	1
ran	1
away.	1
Susan,	1
who	1
was	1
sheltered	1
by	1
a	1
laburnum	1
tree,	1
called	1
to	1
Barbara,	1
upon	1
whom	1
the	1
black	1
clusters	1
of	1
bees	1
were	1
now	1
settling,	1
and	1
begged	1
her	1
to	1
stand	1
still,	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
beat	1
them	1
away.	1
"If	1
you	1
stand	1
quietly	1
you	1
won't	1
be	1
stung,	1
perhaps."	1
But	1
instead	1
of	1
standing	1
quietly,	1
Bab	1
buffeted	1
and	1
stamped	1
and	1
roared,	1
and	1
the	1
bees	1
stung	1
her	1
terribly.	1
Her	1
arms	1
and	1
her	1
face	1
swelled	1
in	1
a	1
frightful	1
manner.	1
She	1
was	1
helped	1
home	1
by	1
poor	1
Susan	1
and	1
treacherous	1
Mrs.	1
Betty,	1
who,	1
now	1
the	1
mischief	1
was	1
done,	1
thought	1
only	1
of	1
exculpating	1
herself	1
to	1
her	1
master.	1
"Indeed,	1
Miss	1
Barbara,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"this	1
was	1
quite	1
wrong	1
of	1
you	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
get	1
yourself	1
into	1
such	1
a	1
scrape.	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
turned	1
away	1
for	1
it,	1
you'll	1
see."	1
"I	1
don't	1
care	1
whether	1
you	1
are	1
turned	1
away	1
or	1
not,"	1
said	1
Barbara;	1
"I	1
never	1
felt	1
such	1
pain	1
in	1
my	1
life.	1
Can't	1
you	1
do	1
something	1
for	1
me?	1
I	1
don't	1
mind	1
the	1
pain	1
either	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
being	1
such	1
a	1
fright.	1
Pray,	1
how	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
be	1
fit	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
at	1
breakfast	1
by	1
Mrs.	1
Strathspey;	1
and	1
I	1
suppose	1
I	1
can't	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
ball	1
either	1
to-morrow,	1
after	1
all!"	1
"No,	1
that	1
you	1
can't	1
expect	1
to	1
do,	1
indeed,"	1
said	1
Betty,	1
the	1
comforter.	1
"You	1
need	1
not	1
think	1
of	1
balls;	1
for	1
those	1
lumps	1
and	1
swellings	1
won't	1
go	1
off	1
your	1
face	1
this	1
week.	1
That's	1
not	1
what	1
pains	1
me;	1
but	1
I'm	1
thinking	1
of	1
what	1
your	1
papa	1
will	1
say	1
to	1
me	1
when	1
he	1
sees	1
you,	1
miss."	1
Whilst	1
this	1
amiable	1
mistress	1
and	1
maid	1
were	1
in	1
their	1
adversity	1
reviling	1
one	1
another,	1
Susan,	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
be	1
of	1
no	1
further	1
use,	1
was	1
preparing	1
to	1
depart,	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
house-door,	1
she	1
was	1
met	1
by	1
Mr.	1
Case.	1
Mr.	1
Case	1
had	1
revolved	1
things	1
in	1
his	1
mind;	1
for	1
his	1
second	1
visit	1
at	1
the	1
Abbey	1
pleased	1
him	1
as	1
little	1
as	1
his	1
first,	1
owing	1
to	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
which	1
Sir	1
Arthur	1
and	1
Miss	1
Somers	1
dropped	1
in	1
speaking	1
of	1
Susan	1
and	1
Farmer	1
Price.	1
Mr.	1
Case	1
began	1
to	1
fear	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
mistaken	1
his	1
game	1
in	1
quarrelling	1
with	1
this	1
family.	1
The	1
refusal	1
of	1
his	1
present	1
dwelt	1
upon	1
the	1
attorney's	1
mind;	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
aware	1
that,	1
if	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
Susan's	1
lamb	1
ever	1
reached	1
the	1
Abbey,	1
he	1
was	1
undone.	1
He	1
now	1
thought	1
that	1
the	1
most	1
prudent	1
course	1
he	1
could	1
possibly	1
follow	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
HUSH	1
UP	1
matters	1
with	1
the	1
Prices	1
with	1
all	1
convenient	1
speed.	1
Consequently,	1
when	1
he	1
met	1
Susan	1
at	1
his	1
door,	1
he	1
forced	1
a	1
gracious	1
smile.	1
"How	1
is	1
your	1
mother,	1
Susan?"	1
said	1
he.	1
"Is	1
there	1
anything	1
in	1
our	1
house	1
can	1
be	1
of	1
service	1
to	1
her?"	1
On	1
hearing	1
his	1
daughter	1
he	1
cried	1
out,	1
"Barbara,	1
Barbara--Bab!	1
come	1
downstairs,	1
child,	1
and	1
speak	1
to	1
Susan	1
Price."	1
But	1
as	1
no	1
Barbara	1
answered,	1
her	1
father	1
stalked	1
upstairs	1
directly,	1
opened	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
stood	1
amazed	1
at	1
the	1
spectacle	1
of	1
her	1
swelled	1
visage.	1
Betty	1
instantly	1
began	1
to	1
tell	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
Barbara's	1
mishap	1
her	1
own	1
way.	1
Bab	1
contradicted	1
her	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
she	1
spoke.	1
The	1
attorney	1
turned	1
the	1
maid	1
away	1
on	1
the	1
spot;	1
and	1
partly	1
with	1
real	1
anger,	1
and	1
partly	1
with	1
feigned	1
affectation	1
of	1
anger,	1
he	1
demanded	1
from	1
his	1
daughter	1
how	1
she	1
dared	1
to	1
treat	1
Susan	1
Price	1
so	1
ill,	1
"when,"	1
as	1
he	1
said,	1
"she	1
was	1
so	1
neighbourly	1
and	1
obliging	1
as	1
to	1
give	1
you	1
some	1
of	1
her	1
honey?	1
Couldn't	1
you	1
be	1
content,	1
without	1
seizing	1
upon	1
the	1
honey-comb	1
by	1
force?	1
This	1
is	1
scandalous	1
behaviour,	1
and	1
what,	1
I	1
assure	1
you,	1
I	1
can't	1
countenance."	1
Susan	1
now	1
interceded	1
for	1
Barbara;	1
and	1
the	1
attorney,	1
softening	1
his	1
voice,	1
said	1
that	1
"Susan	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
too	1
good	1
to	1
her;	1
as	1
you	1
are,	1
indeed,"	1
added	1
he,	1
"to	1
everybody.	1
I	1
forgive	1
her	1
for	1
your	1
sake."	1
Susan	1
curtsied,	1
in	1
great	1
surprise;	1
but	1
her	1
lamb	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
forgotten,	1
and	1
she	1
left	1
the	1
attorney's	1
house	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
could,	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
mother's	1
rosemary	1
tea	1
breakfast.	1
Mr.	1
Case	1
saw	1
that	1
Susan	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
simple	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
taken	1
in	1
by	1
a	1
few	1
fair	1
words.	1
His	1
next	1
attempt	1
was	1
to	1
conciliate	1
Farmer	1
Price.	1
The	1
farmer	1
was	1
a	1
blunt,	1
honest	1
man,	1
and	1
his	1
countenance	1
remained	1
inflexibly	1
contemptuous,	1
when	1
the	1
attorney	1
addressed	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
softest	1
tone.	1
So	1
stood	1
matters	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
long	1
expected	1
harpers'	1
ball.	1
Miss	1
Barbara	1
Case,	1
stung	1
by	1
Susan's	1
bees,	1
could	1
not,	1
after	1
all	1
her	1
manoeuvres,	1
go	1
with	1
Mrs.	1
Strathspey	1
to	1
the	1
ball.	1
The	1
ballroom	1
was	1
filled	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
evening.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
numerous	1
assembly.	1
The	1
harpers,	1
who	1
contended	1
for	1
the	1
prize,	1
were	1
placed	1
under	1
the	1
music-gallery	1
at	1
the	1
lower	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
room.	1
Amongst	1
them	1
was	1
our	1
old	1
blind	1
friend,	1
who,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
well	1
clad	1
as	1
his	1
competitors,	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
disdained	1
by	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
spectators.	1
Six	1
ladies	1
and	1
six	1
gentlemen	1
were	1
now	1
appointed	1
to	1
be	1
judges	1
of	1
the	1
performance.	1
They	1
were	1
seated	1
in	1
a	1
semicircle,	1
opposite	1
to	1
the	1
harpers.	1
The	1
Miss	1
Somerses,	1
who	1
were	1
fond	1
of	1
music,	1
were	1
amongst	1
the	1
ladies	1
in	1
the	1
semicircle;	1
and	1
the	1
prize	1
was	1
lodged	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
Sir	1
Arthur.	1
There	1
was	1
now	1
silence.	1
The	1
first	1
harp	1
sounded,	1
and	1
as	1
each	1
musician	1
tried	1
his	1
skill,	1
the	1
audience	1
seemed	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
each	1
deserved	1
the	1
prize.	1
The	1
old	1
blind	1
man	1
was	1
the	1
last.	1
He	1
tuned	1
his	1
instrument;	1
and	1
such	1
a	1
simple,	1
pathetic	1
strain	1
was	1
heard	1
as	1
touched	1
every	1
heart.	1
All	1
were	1
fixed	1
in	1
delighted	1
attention;	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
music	1
ceased,	1
the	1
silence	1
for	1
some	1
moments	1
continued.	1
The	1
silence	1
was	1
followed	1
by	1
a	1
universal	1
buzz	1
of	1
applause.	1
The	1
judges	1
were	1
unanimous	1
in	1
their	1
opinions,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
declared	1
that	1
the	1
old	1
blind	1
harper,	1
who	1
played	1
the	1
last,	1
deserved	1
the	1
prize.	1
The	1
simple,	1
pathetic	1
air	1
which	1
won	1
the	1
suffrages	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
assembly,	1
was	1
his	1
own	1
composition.	1
He	1
was	1
pressed	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
words	1
belonging	1
to	1
the	1
music;	1
and	1
at	1
last	1
he	1
modestly	1
offered	1
to	1
repeat	1
them,	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
to	1
write.	1
Miss	1
Somers'	1
ready	1
pencil	1
was	1
instantly	1
produced;	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
harper	1
dictated	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
his	1
ballad,	1
which	1
he	1
called--	1
"Susan's	1
Lamentation	1
for	1
her	1
Lamb."	1
Miss	1
Somers	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
brother	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time,	1
as	1
she	1
wrote;	1
and	1
Sir	1
Arthur,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
had	1
finished,	1
took	1
him	1
aside,	1
and	1
asked	1
him	1
some	1
questions,	1
which	1
brought	1
the	1
whole	1
history	1
of	1
Susan's	1
lamb	1
and	1
of	1
Attorney	1
Case's	1
cruelty	1
to	1
light.	1
The	1
attorney	1
himself	1
was	1
present	1
when	1
the	1
harper	1
began	1
to	1
dictate	1
his	1
ballad.	1
His	1
colour,	1
as	1
Sir	1
Arthur	1
steadily	1
looked	1
at	1
him,	1
varied	1
continually;	1
till	1
at	1
length,	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
words	1
"Susan's	1
Lamentation	1
for	1
her	1
Lamb,"	1
he	1
suddenly	1
shrunk	1
back,	1
skulked	1
through	1
the	1
crowd,	1
and	1
disappeared.	1
We	1
shall	1
not	1
follow	1
him;	1
we	1
had	1
rather	1
follow	1
our	1
old	1
friend,	1
the	1
victorious	1
harper.	1
No	1
sooner	1
had	1
he	1
received	1
the	1
ten	1
guineas,	1
his	1
well	1
merited	1
prize,	1
than	1
he	1
retired	1
to	1
a	1
small	1
room	1
belonging	1
to	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
asked	1
for	1
pen,	1
ink	1
and	1
paper,	1
and	1
dictated,	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice,	1
to	1
his	1
boy,	1
who	1
was	1
a	1
tolerably	1
good	1
scribe,	1
a	1
letter,	1
which	1
he	1
ordered	1
him	1
to	1
put	1
directly	1
into	1
the	1
Shrewsbury	1
post-office.	1
The	1
boy	1
ran	1
with	1
the	1
letter	1
to	1
the	1
post-office.	1
He	1
was	1
but	1
just	1
in	1
time,	1
for	1
the	1
postman's	1
horn	1
was	1
sounding.	1
The	1
next	1
morning,	1
when	1
Farmer	1
Price,	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
Susan,	1
were	1
sitting	1
together,	1
reflecting	1
that	1
his	1
week's	1
leave	1
of	1
absence	1
was	1
nearly	1
at	1
an	1
end,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
money	1
was	1
not	1
yet	1
made	1
up	1
for	1
John	1
Simpson,	1
the	1
substitute,	1
a	1
knock	1
was	1
heard	1
at	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
the	1
person	1
who	1
usually	1
delivered	1
the	1
letters	1
in	1
the	1
village	1
put	1
a	1
letter	1
into	1
Susan's	1
hand,	1
saying,	1
"A	1
penny,	1
if	1
you	1
please--here's	1
a	1
letter	1
for	1
your	1
father."	1
"For	1
me!"	1
said	1
Farmer	1
Price;	1
"here's	1
the	1
penny	1
then,	1
but	1
who	1
can	1
it	1
be	1
from,	1
I	1
wonder?	1
Who	1
can	1
think	1
of	1
writing	1
to	1
me,	1
in	1
this	1
world?"	1
He	1
tore	1
open	1
the	1
letter;	1
but	1
the	1
hard	1
name	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
page	1
puzzled	1
him-	1
-"your	1
obliged	1
friend,	1
Llewellyn."	1
"And	1
what's	1
this?"	1
said	1
he,	1
opening	1
a	1
paper	1
that	1
was	1
inclosed	1
in	1
the	1
letter.	1
"It's	1
a	1
song,	1
seemingly;	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
somebody	1
that	1
has	1
a	1
mind	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
April	1
fool	1
of	1
me."	1
"But	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
April,	1
it	1
is	1
May,	1
father,"	1
said	1
Susan.	1
"Well,	1
let	1
us	1
read	1
the	1
letter,	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
truth	1
all	1
in	1
good	1
time."	1
Farmer	1
Price	1
sat	1
down	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
chair,	1
for	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
read	1
entirely	1
to	1
his	1
satisfaction	1
in	1
any	1
other,	1
and	1
read	1
as	1
follows:--	1
"MY	1
WORTHY	1
FRIEND,--I	1
am	1
sure	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
glad	1
to	1
hear	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
good	1
success	1
this	1
night.	1
I	1
have	1
won	1
the	1
ten	1
guinea	1
prize,	1
and	1
for	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
measure	1
indebted	1
to	1
your	1
sweet	1
daughter	1
Susan;	1
as	1
you	1
will	1
see	1
by	1
a	1
little	1
ballad	1
I	1
inclose	1
for	1
her.	1
Your	1
hospitality	1
to	1
me	1
has	1
afforded	1
to	1
me	1
an	1
opportunity	1
of	1
learning	1
some	1
of	1
your	1
family	1
history.	1
You	1
do	1
not,	1
I	1
hope,	1
forget	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
present	1
when	1
you	1
were	1
counting	1
the	1
treasure	1
in	1
Susan's	1
little	1
purse,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
heard	1
for	1
what	1
purpose	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
destined.	1
You	1
have	1
not,	1
I	1
know,	1
yet	1
made	1
up	1
the	1
full	1
sum	1
for	1
your	1
substitute,	1
John	1
Simpson;	1
therefore	1
do	1
me	1
the	1
favour	1
to	1
use	1
the	1
five	1
guinea	1
bank	1
note	1
which	1
you	1
will	1
find	1
within	1
the	1
ballad.	1
You	1
shall	1
not	1
find	1
me	1
as	1
hard	1
a	1
creditor	1
as	1
Attorney	1
Case.	1
Pay	1
me	1
the	1
money	1
at	1
your	1
own	1
convenience.	1
If	1
it	1
is	1
never	1
convenient	1
to	1
you	1
to	1
pay	1
it,	1
I	1
shall	1
never	1
ask	1
it.	1
I	1
shall	1
go	1
my	1
rounds	1
again	1
through	1
this	1
country,	1
I	1
believe,	1
about	1
this	1
time	1
next	1
year,	1
and	1
will	1
call	1
to	1
see	1
how	1
you	1
do,	1
and	1
to	1
play	1
the	1
new	1
tune	1
for	1
Susan	1
and	1
the	1
dear	1
little	1
boys.	1
"I	1
should	1
just	1
add,	1
to	1
set	1
your	1
heart	1
at	1
rest	1
about	1
the	1
money,	1
that	1
it	1
does	1
not	1
distress	1
me	1
at	1
all	1
to	1
lend	1
it	1
to	1
you.	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
quite	1
so	1
poor	1
as	1
I	1
appear	1
to	1
be.	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
my	1
humour	1
to	1
go	1
about	1
as	1
I	1
do.	1
I	1
see	1
more	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
under	1
my	1
tattered	1
garb	1
than,	1
perhaps,	1
I	1
should	1
ever	1
see	1
in	1
a	1
better	1
dress.	1
There	1
are	1
many	1
of	1
my	1
profession	1
who	1
are	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
mind	1
as	1
myself	1
in	1
this	1
respect;	1
and	1
we	1
are	1
glad,	1
when	1
it	1
lies	1
in	1
our	1
way,	1
to	1
do	1
any	1
kindness	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
worthy	1
family	1
as	1
yours.--So,	1
fare	1
ye	1
well.	1
"Your	1
obliged	1
Friend,	1
"LLEWELLYN."	1
Susan	1
now,	1
by	1
her	1
father's	1
desire,	1
opened	1
the	1
ballad.	1
He	1
picked	1
up	1
the	1
five	1
guinea	1
bank	1
note,	1
whilst	1
she	1
read,	1
with	1
surprise,	1
"Susan's	1
Lamentation	1
for	1
her	1
Lamb."	1
Her	1
mother	1
leaned	1
over	1
her	1
shoulder	1
to	1
read	1
the	1
words;	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
interrupted,	1
before	1
they	1
had	1
finished	1
the	1
first	1
stanza,	1
by	1
another	1
knock	1
at	1
the	1
door.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
postman	1
with	1
another	1
letter.	1
It	1
was	1
Sir	1
Arthur	1
and	1
his	1
sisters.	1
They	1
came	1
with	1
an	1
intention,	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
much	1
disappointed	1
to	1
find	1
that	1
the	1
old	1
harper	1
had	1
rendered	1
vain--they	1
came	1
to	1
lend	1
the	1
farmer	1
and	1
his	1
good	1
family	1
the	1
money	1
to	1
pay	1
for	1
his	1
substitute.	1
"But,	1
since	1
we	1
are	1
here,"	1
said	1
Sir	1
Arthur,	1
"let	1
me	1
do	1
my	1
own	1
business,	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
like	1
to	1
have	1
forgotten.	1
Mr.	1
Price,	1
will	1
you	1
come	1
out	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
let	1
me	1
show	1
you	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
your	1
land,	1
through	1
which	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
road.	1
Look	1
there,"	1
said	1
Sir	1
Arthur,	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
spot,	1
"I	1
am	1
laying	1
out	1
a	1
ride	1
round	1
my	1
estate,	1
and	1
that	1
bit	1
of	1
land	1
of	1
yours	1
stops	1
me."	1
"Why,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
Price,	1
"the	1
land's	1
mine,	1
to	1
be	1
sure,	1
for	1
that	1
matter;	1
but	1
I	1
hope	1
you	1
don't	1
look	1
upon	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
that	1
sort	1
of	1
person	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
stiff	1
about	1
a	1
trifle	1
or	1
so."	1
"The	1
fact	1
is,"	1
said	1
Sir	1
Arthur,	1
"I	1
had	1
heard	1
you	1
were	1
a	1
litigious,	1
pig-	1
headed	1
fellow;	1
but	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
deserve	1
this	1
character."	1
"Hope	1
not,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
the	1
farmer;	1
"but	1
about	1
the	1
matter	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
I	1
don't	1
want	1
to	1
take	1
any	1
advantage	1
of	1
your	1
wishing	1
for	1
it.	1
You	1
are	1
welcome	1
to	1
it;	1
and	1
I	1
leave	1
it	1
to	1
you	1
to	1
find	1
me	1
out	1
another	1
bit	1
of	1
land	1
convenient	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
will	1
be	1
worth	1
neither	1
more	1
nor	1
less;	1
or	1
else	1
to	1
make	1
up	1
the	1
value	1
to	1
me	1
some	1
way	1
or	1
other.	1
I	1
need	1
say	1
no	1
more	1
about	1
it."	1
"I	1
hear	1
something,"	1
continued	1
Sir	1
Arthur,	1
after	1
a	1
short	1
silence--"I	1
hear	1
something,	1
Mr.	1
Price,	1
of	1
a	1
FLAW	1
in	1
your	1
lease.	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
speak	1
to	1
you	1
about	1
it	1
whilst	1
we	1
were	1
bargaining	1
about	1
your	1
land,	1
lest	1
I	1
should	1
over-	1
awe	1
you;	1
but,	1
tell	1
me,	1
what	1
is	1
this	1
flaw?"	1
"In	1
truth,	1
and	1
the	1
truth	1
is	1
the	1
fittest	1
thing	1
to	1
be	1
spoken	1
at	1
all	1
times,"	1
said	1
the	1
farmer,	1
"I	1
didn't	1
know	1
myself	1
what	1
a	1
flaw,	1
as	1
they	1
call	1
it,	1
meant,	1
till	1
I	1
heard	1
of	1
the	1
word	1
from	1
Attorney	1
Case;	1
and,	1
I	1
take	1
it,	1
a	1
flaw	1
is	1
neither	1
more	1
nor	1
less	1
than	1
a	1
mistake,	1
as	1
one	1
should	1
say.	1
Now,	1
by	1
reason	1
a	1
man	1
does	1
not	1
make	1
a	1
mistake	1
on	1
purpose,	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
fair	1
thing,	1
that	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
finds	1
out	1
his	1
mistake,	1
he	1
might	1
set	1
it	1
right;	1
but	1
Attorney	1
Case	1
says	1
this	1
is	1
not	1
law;	1
and	1
I've	1
no	1
more	1
to	1
say.	1
The	1
man	1
who	1
drew	1
up	1
my	1
lease	1
made	1
a	1
mistake;	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
must	1
suffer	1
for	1
it,	1
I	1
must,"	1
said	1
the	1
farmer.	1
"However,	1
I	1
can	1
show	1
you,	1
Sir	1
Arthur,	1
just	1
for	1
my	1
own	1
satisfaction	1
and	1
yours,	1
a	1
few	1
lines	1
of	1
a	1
memorandum	1
on	1
a	1
slip	1
of	1
paper,	1
which	1
was	1
given	1
me	1
by	1
your	1
relation,	1
the	1
gentleman	1
who	1
lived	1
here	1
before,	1
and	1
let	1
me	1
my	1
farm.	1
You'll	1
see,	1
by	1
that	1
bit	1
of	1
paper,	1
what	1
was	1
meant;	1
but	1
the	1
attorney	1
says,	1
the	1
paper's	1
not	1
worth	1
a	1
button	1
in	1
a	1
court	1
of	1
justice,	1
and	1
I	1
don't	1
understand	1
these	1
things.	1
All	1
I	1
understand	1
is	1
the	1
common	1
honesty	1
of	1
the	1
matter.	1
I've	1
no	1
more	1
to	1
say."	1
"This	1
attorney,	1
whom	1
you	1
speak	1
of	1
so	1
often,"	1
said	1
Sir	1
Arthur,	1
"you	1
seem	1
to	1
have	1
some	1
quarrel	1
with.	1
Now,	1
would	1
you	1
tell	1
me	1
frankly	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
matter	1
between--?"	1
"The	1
matter	1
between	1
us,	1
then,"	1
said	1
Price,	1
"is	1
a	1
little	1
bit	1
of	1
ground,	1
not	1
worth	1
much,	1
that	1
is	1
there	1
open	1
to	1
the	1
lane	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Case's	1
garden,	1
sir,	1
and	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
take	1
it	1
in.	1
Now	1
I	1
told	1
him	1
my	1
mind,	1
that	1
it	1
belonged	1
to	1
the	1
parish,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
never	1
would	1
willingly	1
give	1
my	1
consent	1
to	1
his	1
cribbing	1
it	1
in	1
that	1
way.	1
Sir,	1
I	1
was	1
the	1
more	1
loath	1
to	1
see	1
it	1
shut	1
into	1
his	1
garden,	1
which,	1
moreover,	1
is	1
large	1
enough	1
of	1
all	1
conscience	1
without	1
it,	1
because	1
you	1
must	1
know,	1
Sir	1
Arthur,	1
the	1
children	1
in	1
our	1
village	1
are	1
fond	1
of	1
making	1
a	1
little	1
play-green	1
of	1
it;	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
a	1
custom	1
of	1
meeting	1
on	1
May	1
day	1
at	1
a	1
hawthorn	1
that	1
stands	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
altogether	1
I	1
was	1
very	1
loath	1
to	1
see	1
'em	1
turned	1
out	1
of	1
it	1
by	1
those	1
who	1
have	1
no	1
right."	1
"Let	1
us	1
go	1
and	1
see	1
this	1
nook,"	1
said	1
Sir	1
Arthur.	1
"It	1
is	1
not	1
far	1
off,	1
is	1
it?"	1
"Oh,	1
no,	1
sir,	1
just	1
hard	1
by	1
here."	1
When	1
they	1
got	1
to	1
the	1
ground,	1
Mr.	1
Case,	1
who	1
saw	1
them	1
walking	1
together,	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
hurry	1
to	1
join	1
them,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
put	1
a	1
stop	1
to	1
any	1
explanations.	1
Explanations	1
were	1
things	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
great	1
dread;	1
but,	1
fortunately,	1
he	1
was	1
upon	1
this	1
occasion	1
a	1
little	1
too	1
late.	1
"Is	1
this	1
the	1
nook	1
in	1
dispute?"	1
said	1
Sir	1
Arthur.	1
"Yes;	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
whole	1
thing,"	1
said	1
Price.	1
"Why,	1
Sir	1
Arthur,"	1
interposed	1
the	1
politic	1
attorney,	1
with	1
an	1
assumed	1
air	1
of	1
generosity,	1
"don't	1
let	1
us	1
talk	1
any	1
more	1
about	1
it.	1
Let	1
it	1
belong	1
to	1
whom	1
it	1
will,	1
I	1
give	1
it	1
up	1
to	1
you."	1
"So	1
great	1
a	1
lawyer,	1
Mr.	1
Case,	1
as	1
you	1
are,"	1
replied	1
Sir	1
Arthur,	1
"must	1
know,	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
cannot	1
give	1
up	1
that	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
has	1
no	1
legal	1
title;	1
and	1
in	1
this	1
case	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
that,	1
with	1
the	1
best	1
intentions	1
to	1
oblige	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
you	1
can	1
give	1
up	1
this	1
bit	1
of	1
land	1
to	1
me,	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
mine	1
already,	1
as	1
I	1
can	1
convince	1
you	1
effectually	1
by	1
a	1
map	1
of	1
the	1
adjoining	1
land,	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
fortunately	1
safe	1
amongst	1
my	1
papers.	1
This	1
piece	1
of	1
ground	1
belonged	1
to	1
the	1
farm	1
on	1
the	1
opposite	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
road,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
cut	1
off	1
when	1
the	1
lane	1
was	1
made."	1
"Very	1
possibly.	1
I	1
daresay	1
you	1
are	1
quite	1
correct;	1
you	1
must	1
know	1
best,"	1
said	1
the	1
attorney,	1
trembling	1
for	1
the	1
agency.	1
"Then,"	1
said	1
Sir	1
Arthur,	1
"Mr.	1
Price,	1
you	1
will	1
observe	1
that	1
I	1
now	1
promise	1
this	1
little	1
green	1
to	1
the	1
children	1
for	1
a	1
play-ground;	1
and	1
I	1
hope	1
they	1
may	1
gather	1
hawthorn	1
many	1
a	1
May	1
day	1
at	1
this	1
their	1
favourite	1
bush."	1
Mr.	1
Price	1
bowed	1
low,	1
which	1
he	1
seldom	1
did,	1
even	1
when	1
he	1
received	1
a	1
favour	1
himself.	1
"And	1
now,	1
Mr.	1
Case,"	1
said	1
Sir	1
Arthur,	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
attorney,	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
which	1
way	1
to	1
look,	1
"you	1
sent	1
me	1
a	1
lease	1
to	1
look	1
over."	1
"Ye-ye-yes,"	1
stammered	1
Mr	1
Case.	1
"I	1
thought	1
it	1
my	1
duty	1
to	1
do	1
so;	1
not	1
out	1
of	1
any	1
malice	1
or	1
ill-will	1
to	1
this	1
good	1
man."	1
"You	1
have	1
done	1
him	1
no	1
injury,"	1
said	1
Sir	1
Arthur,	1
coolly.	1
"I	1
am	1
ready	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
a	1
new	1
lease,	1
whenever	1
he	1
pleases,	1
of	1
his	1
farm,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
guided	1
by	1
a	1
memorandum	1
of	1
the	1
original	1
bargain,	1
which	1
he	1
has	1
in	1
his	1
possession.	1
I	1
hope	1
I	1
never	1
shall	1
take	1
an	1
unfair	1
advantage	1
of	1
anyone."	1
"Heaven	1
forbid,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
the	1
attorney,	1
sanctifying	1
his	1
face,	1
"that	1
I	1
should	1
suggest	1
the	1
taking	1
an	1
UNFAIR	1
advantage	1
of	1
any	1
man,	1
rich	1
or	1
poor;	1
but	1
to	1
break	1
a	1
bad	1
lease	1
is	1
not	1
taking	1
an	1
unfair	1
advantage."	1
"You	1
really	1
think	1
so?"	1
said	1
Sir	1
Arthur.	1
"Certainly	1
I	1
do,	1
and	1
I	1
hope	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
hazarded	1
your	1
good	1
opinion	1
by	1
speaking	1
my	1
mind	1
concerning	1
the	1
flaw	1
so	1
plainly.	1
I	1
always	1
understood	1
that	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
nothing	1
ungentlemanlike,	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
business,	1
in	1
taking	1
advantage	1
of	1
a	1
flaw	1
in	1
a	1
lease."	1
"Now,"	1
said	1
Sir	1
Arthur,	1
"you	1
have	1
pronounced	1
judgment	1
undesignedly	1
in	1
your	1
own	1
case.	1
You	1
intended	1
to	1
send	1
me	1
this	1
poor	1
man's	1
lease;	1
but	1
your	1
son,	1
by	1
some	1
mistake,	1
brought	1
me	1
your	1
own,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
discovered	1
a	1
fatal	1
error	1
in	1
it."	1
"A	1
fatal	1
error!"	1
said	1
the	1
alarmed	1
attorney.	1
"Yes,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
Sir	1
Arthur,	1
pulling	1
the	1
lease	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
pocket.	1
"Here	1
it	1
is.	1
You	1
will	1
observe	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
neither	1
signed	1
nor	1
sealed	1
by	1
the	1
grantor."	1
"But,	1
you	1
won't	1
take	1
advantage	1
of	1
me,	1
surely,	1
Sir	1
Arthur?"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Case,	1
forgetting	1
his	1
own	1
principles.	1
"I	1
shall	1
not	1
take	1
advantage	1
of	1
you,	1
as	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
taken	1
of	1
this	1
honest	1
man.	1
In	1
both	1
cases	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
guided	1
by	1
memoranda	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
in	1
my	1
possession.	1
I	1
shall	1
not,	1
Mr.	1
Case,	1
defraud	1
you	1
of	1
one	1
shilling	1
of	1
your	1
property.	1
I	1
am	1
ready,	1
at	1
a	1
fair	1
valuation,	1
to	1
pay	1
the	1
exact	1
value	1
of	1
your	1
house	1
and	1
land;	1
but	1
upon	1
this	1
condition--that	1
you	1
quit	1
the	1
parish	1
within	1
one	1
month!"	1
Attorney	1
Case	1
was	1
thus	1
compelled	1
to	1
submit	1
to	1
the	1
hard	1
necessity	1
of	1
the	1
case,	1
for	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
legally	1
resist.	1
Indeed	1
he	1
was	1
glad	1
to	1
be	1
let	1
off	1
so	1
easily;	1
and	1
he	1
bowed	1
and	1
sneaked	1
away,	1
secretly	1
comforting	1
himself	1
with	1
the	1
hope,	1
that	1
when	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
valuation	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
land	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
the	1
gainer,	1
perhaps	1
of	1
a	1
few	1
guineas.	1
His	1
reputation	1
he	1
justly	1
held	1
very	1
cheap.	1
"You	1
are	1
a	1
scholar;	1
you	1
write	1
a	1
good	1
hand;	1
you	1
can	1
keep	1
accounts,	1
cannot	1
you?"	1
said	1
Sir	1
Arthur	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Price,	1
as	1
they	1
walked	1
home	1
towards	1
the	1
cottage.	1
"I	1
think	1
I	1
saw	1
a	1
bill	1
of	1
your	1
little	1
daughter's	1
drawing	1
out	1
the	1
other	1
day,	1
which	1
was	1
very	1
neatly	1
written.	1
Did	1
you	1
teach	1
her	1
to	1
write?"	1
"No,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
Price,	1
"I	1
can't	1
say	1
I	1
did	1
THAT;	1
for	1
she	1
mostly	1
taught	1
it	1
herself,	1
but	1
I	1
taught	1
her	1
a	1
little	1
arithmetic,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
I	1
knew,	1
on	1
our	1
winter	1
nights,	1
when	1
I	1
had	1
nothing	1
better	1
to	1
do."	1
"Your	1
daughter	1
shows	1
that	1
she	1
has	1
been	1
well	1
taught,"	1
said	1
Sir	1
Arthur;	1
"and	1
her	1
good	1
conduct	1
and	1
good	1
character	1
speak	1
strongly	1
in	1
favour	1
of	1
her	1
parents."	1
"You	1
are	1
very	1
good,	1
very	1
good	1
indeed,	1
sir,	1
to	1
speak	1
in	1
this	1
sort	1
of	1
way,"	1
said	1
the	1
delighted	1
father.	1
"But	1
I	1
mean	1
to	1
do	1
more	1
than	1
PAY	1
YOU	1
WITH	1
WORDS,"	1
said	1
Sir	1
Arthur.	1
"You	1
are	1
attached	1
to	1
your	1
own	1
family,	1
perhaps	1
you	1
may	1
become	1
attached	1
to	1
me,	1
when	1
you	1
come	1
to	1
know	1
me,	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
have	1
frequent	1
opportunities	1
of	1
judging	1
of	1
one	1
another.	1
I	1
want	1
no	1
agent	1
to	1
squeeze	1
my	1
tenants,	1
or	1
do	1
my	1
dirty	1
work.	1
I	1
only	1
want	1
a	1
steady,	1
intelligent,	1
honest	1
man,	1
like	1
you,	1
to	1
collect	1
my	1
rents,	1
and	1
I	1
hope,	1
Mr.	1
Price,	1
you	1
will	1
have	1
no	1
objection	1
to	1
the	1
employment."	1
"I	1
hope,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
Price,	1
with	1
joy	1
and	1
gratitude	1
glowing	1
in	1
his	1
honest	1
countenance,	1
"that	1
you'll	1
never	1
have	1
cause	1
to	1
repent	1
your	1
goodness."	1
"And	1
what	1
are	1
my	1
sisters	1
about	1
here?"	1
said	1
Sir	1
Arthur,	1
entering	1
the	1
cottage,	1
and	1
going	1
behind	1
his	1
sisters,	1
who	1
were	1
busily	1
engaged	1
in	1
measuring	1
an	1
extremely	1
pretty	1
coloured	1
calico.	1
"It	1
is	1
for	1
Susan,	1
my	1
dear	1
brother,"	1
said	1
they.	1
"I	1
know	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
keep	1
that	1
guinea	1
for	1
herself,"	1
said	1
Miss	1
Somers.	1
"I	1
have	1
just	1
prevailed	1
upon	1
her	1
mother	1
to	1
tell	1
me	1
what	1
became	1
of	1
it.	1
Susan	1
gave	1
it	1
to	1
her	1
father;	1
but	1
she	1
must	1
not	1
refuse	1
a	1
gown	1
of	1
our	1
choosing	1
this	1
time;	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
she	1
will	1
not,	1
because	1
her	1
mother,	1
I	1
see,	1
likes	1
it.	1
And,	1
Susan,	1
I	1
hear	1
that	1
instead	1
of	1
becoming	1
Queen	1
of	1
the	1
May	1
this	1
year,	1
you	1
were	1
sitting	1
in	1
your	1
sick	1
mother's	1
room.	1
Your	1
mother	1
has	1
a	1
little	1
colour	1
in	1
her	1
cheeks	1
now."	1
"Oh,	1
ma'am,"	1
interrupted	1
Mrs.	1
Price,	1
"I'm	1
quite	1
well.	1
Joy,	1
I	1
think,	1
has	1
made	1
me	1
quite	1
well."	1
"Then,"	1
said	1
Miss	1
Somers,	1
"I	1
hope	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
come	1
out	1
on	1
your	1
daughter's	1
birthday,	1
which,	1
I	1
hear,	1
is	1
the	1
25th	1
of	1
this	1
month.	1
Make	1
haste	1
and	1
get	1
quite	1
well	1
before	1
that	1
day;	1
for	1
my	1
brother	1
intends	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
lads	1
and	1
lassies	1
of	1
the	1
village	1
shall	1
have	1
a	1
dance	1
on	1
Susan's	1
birthday."	1
"Yes,"	1
said	1
Sir	1
Arthur,	1
"and	1
I	1
hope	1
on	1
that	1
day,	1
Susan,	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
very	1
happy	1
with	1
your	1
little	1
friends	1
upon	1
their	1
play-green.	1
I	1
shall	1
tell	1
them	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
your	1
good	1
conduct	1
which	1
has	1
obtained	1
it	1
for	1
them;	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
have	1
anything	1
to	1
ask,	1
any	1
little	1
favour	1
for	1
any	1
of	1
your	1
companions,	1
which	1
we	1
can	1
grant,	1
now	1
ask,	1
Susan.	1
These	1
ladies	1
look	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
refuse	1
you	1
anything	1
that	1
is	1
reasonable;	1
and,	1
I	1
think,	1
you	1
look	1
as	1
if	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
ask	1
anything	1
unreasonable."	1
"Sir,"	1
said	1
Susan,	1
after	1
consulting	1
her	1
mother's	1
eyes,	1
"there	1
is,	1
to	1
be	1
sure,	1
a	1
favour	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
ask;	1
it	1
is	1
for	1
Rose."	1
"Well,	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
who	1
Rose	1
is,"	1
said	1
Sir	1
Arthur,	1
smiling;	1
"but,	1
go	1
on."	1
"Ma'am,	1
you	1
have	1
seen	1
her,	1
I	1
believe;	1
she	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
girl,	1
indeed,"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Price.	1
"And	1
works	1
very	1
neatly,	1
indeed,"	1
continued	1
Susan,	1
eagerly,	1
to	1
Miss	1
Somers;	1
"and	1
she	1
and	1
her	1
mother	1
heard	1
you	1
were	1
looking	1
out	1
for	1
someone	1
to	1
wait	1
upon	1
you."	1
"Say	1
no	1
more,"	1
said	1
Miss	1
Somers;	1
"your	1
wish	1
is	1
granted.	1
Tell	1
Rose	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
Abbey,	1
to-morrow	1
morning,	1
or,	1
rather,	1
come	1
with	1
her	1
yourself;	1
for	1
our	1
housekeeper,	1
I	1
know,	1
wants	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
you	1
about	1
a	1
certain	1
cake.	1
She	1
wishes,	1
Susan,	1
that	1
you	1
should	1
be	1
the	1
maker	1
of	1
the	1
cake	1
for	1
the	1
dance;	1
and	1
she	1
has	1
good	1
things	1
ready	1
looked	1
out	1
for	1
it	1
already,	1
I	1
know.	1
It	1
must	1
be	1
large	1
enough	1
for	1
everybody	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
slice,	1
and	1
the	1
housekeeper	1
will	1
ice	1
it	1
for	1
you.	1
I	1
only	1
hope	1
your	1
cake	1
will	1
be	1
as	1
good	1
as	1
your	1
bread.	1
Fare	1
ye	1
well."	1
How	1
happy	1
are	1
those	1
who	1
bid	1
farewell	1
to	1
a	1
whole	1
family,	1
silent	1
with	1
gratitude,	1
who	1
will	1
bless	1
them	1
aloud	1
when	1
they	1
are	1
far	1
out	1
of	1
hearing!	1
"How	1
do	1
I	1
wish,	1
now,"	1
said	1
Farmer	1
Price,	1
"and	1
it's	1
almost	1
a	1
sin	1
for	1
one	1
that	1
has	1
had	1
such	1
a	1
power	1
of	1
favours	1
done	1
him,	1
to	1
wish	1
for	1
anything	1
more;	1
but	1
how	1
I	1
DO	1
wish,	1
wife,	1
that	1
our	1
good	1
friend,	1
the	1
harper	1
was	1
only	1
here	1
at	1
this	1
time.	1
It	1
would	1
do	1
his	1
old,	1
warm	1
heart	1
good.	1
Well,	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
it	1
is,	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
able	1
next	1
year,	1
when	1
he	1
comes	1
his	1
rounds,	1
to	1
pay	1
him	1
his	1
money	1
with	1
thanks,	1
being	1
all	1
the	1
time,	1
and	1
for	1
ever,	1
as	1
much	1
obliged	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
if	1
we	1
kept	1
it.	1
I	1
long,	1
so	1
I	1
do,	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
in	1
this	1
house	1
again,	1
drinking,	1
as	1
he	1
did,	1
just	1
in	1
this	1
spot,	1
a	1
glass	1
of	1
Susan's	1
mead,	1
to	1
her	1
very	1
good	1
health."	1
"Yes,"	1
said	1
Susan,	1
"and	1
the	1
next	1
time	1
he	1
comes,	1
I	1
can	1
give	1
him	1
one	1
of	1
my	1
guinea-hen's	1
eggs,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
show	1
my	1
lamb,	1
Daisy."	1
"True,	1
love,"	1
said	1
her	1
mother,	1
"and	1
he	1
will	1
play	1
that	1
tune	1
and	1
sing	1
that	1
pretty	1
ballad.	1
Where	1
is	1
it?	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
finished	1
it."	1
"Rose	1
ran	1
away	1
with	1
it,	1
mother,	1
but	1
I'll	1
step	1
after	1
her,	1
and	1
bring	1
it	1
back	1
to	1
you	1
this	1
minute,"	1
said	1
Susan.	1
Susan	1
found	1
her	1
friend	1
Rose	1
at	1
the	1
hawthorn,	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
a	1
crowded	1
circle	1
of	1
her	1
companions,	1
to	1
whom	1
she	1
was	1
reading	1
"Susan's	1
Lamentation	1
for	1
her	1
Lamb."	1
"The	1
words	1
are	1
something,	1
but	1
the	1
tune--the	1
tune--I	1
must	1
have	1
the	1
tune,"	1
cried	1
Philip.	1
"I'll	1
ask	1
my	1
mother	1
to	1
ask	1
Sir	1
Arthur	1
to	1
try	1
and	1
find	1
out	1
which	1
way	1
that	1
good	1
old	1
man	1
went	1
after	1
the	1
ball;	1
and	1
if	1
he's	1
above	1
ground,	1
we'll	1
have	1
him	1
back	1
by	1
Susan's	1
birthday,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
sit	1
here--	1
just	1
exactly	1
here	1
by	1
this,	1
our	1
bush,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
play--I	1
mean,	1
if	1
he	1
pleases--that	1
same	1
tune	1
for	1
us,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
learn	1
it--I	1
mean,	1
if	1
I	1
can--	1
in	1
a	1
minute."	1
The	1
good	1
news	1
that	1
Farmer	1
Price	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
employed	1
to	1
collect	1
the	1
rents,	1
and	1
that	1
Attorney	1
Case	1
was	1
to	1
leave	1
the	1
parish	1
in	1
a	1
month,	1
soon	1
spread	1
over	1
the	1
village.	1
Many	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
houses	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
hearing	1
the	1
joyful	1
tidings	1
confirmed	1
by	1
Susan	1
herself.	1
The	1
crowd	1
on	1
the	1
play-green	1
increased	1
every	1
minute.	1
"Yes,"	1
cried	1
the	1
triumphant	1
Philip,	1
"I	1
tell	1
you	1
it's	1
all	1
true,	1
every	1
word	1
of	1
it.	1
Susan's	1
too	1
modest	1
to	1
say	1
it	1
herself;	1
but	1
I	1
tell	1
ye	1
all,	1
Sir	1
Arthur	1
gave	1
us	1
this	1
play-green	1
for	1
ever,	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
her	1
being	1
so	1
good."	1
You	1
see,	1
at	1
last	1
Attorney	1
Case,	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
cunning	1
has	1
not	1
proved	1
a	1
match	1
for	1
"Simple	1
Susan."	1
THE	1
WHITE	1
PIGEON.	1
The	1
little	1
town	1
of	1
Somerville,	1
in	1
Ireland,	1
has,	1
within	1
these	1
few	1
years,	1
assumed	1
the	1
neat	1
and	1
cheerful	1
appearance	1
of	1
an	1
English	1
village.	1
Mr.	1
Somerville,	1
to	1
whom	1
this	1
town	1
belongs,	1
wished	1
to	1
inspire	1
his	1
tenantry	1
with	1
a	1
taste	1
for	1
order	1
and	1
domestic	1
happiness,	1
and	1
took	1
every	1
means	1
in	1
his	1
power	1
to	1
encourage	1
industrious,	1
well	1
behaved	1
people	1
to	1
settle	1
in	1
his	1
neighbourhood.	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
finished	1
building	1
a	1
row	1
of	1
good	1
slated	1
houses	1
in	1
his	1
town,	1
he	1
declared	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
let	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
best	1
tenants	1
he	1
could	1
find,	1
and	1
proposals	1
were	1
publicly	1
sent	1
to	1
him	1
from	1
all	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
country.	1
By	1
the	1
best	1
tenants,	1
Mr.	1
Somerville	1
did	1
not,	1
however,	1
mean	1
the	1
best	1
bidders;	1
and	1
many,	1
who	1
had	1
offered	1
an	1
extravagant	1
price	1
for	1
the	1
houses,	1
were	1
surprised	1
to	1
find	1
their	1
proposals	1
rejected.	1
Amongst	1
these	1
was	1
Mr.	1
Cox,	1
an	1
alehouse	1
keeper,	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
bear	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
character.	1
"Please	1
your	1
honour,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Somerville,	1
"I	1
expected,	1
since	1
I	1
bid	1
as	1
fair	1
and	1
fairer	1
for	1
it	1
than	1
any	1
other,	1
that	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
let	1
me	1
the	1
house	1
next	1
the	1
apothecary's.	1
Was	1
not	1
it	1
fifteen	1
guineas	1
I	1
mentioned	1
in	1
my	1
proposal?	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
your	1
honour	1
give	1
it	1
against	1
me	1
for	1
thirteen?"	1
"My	1
honour	1
did	1
just	1
so,"	1
replied	1
Mr.	1
Somerville,	1
calmly.	1
"And	1
please	1
your	1
honour,	1
but	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
I	1
or	1
mine	1
have	1
done	1
to	1
offend	1
you.	1
I'm	1
sure	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
gentleman	1
in	1
all	1
Ireland	1
I'd	1
go	1
further	1
to	1
sarve.	1
Would	1
not	1
I	1
go	1
to	1
Cork	1
to-morrow	1
for	1
the	1
least	1
word	1
from	1
your	1
honour?"	1
"I	1
am	1
much	1
obliged	1
to	1
you,	1
Mr.	1
Cox,	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
business	1
at	1
Cork	1
at	1
present,"	1
answered	1
Mr.	1
Somerville,	1
drily.	1
"It	1
is	1
all	1
I	1
wish,"	1
exclaimed	1
Mr.	1
Cox,	1
"that	1
I	1
could	1
find	1
out	1
and	1
light	1
upon	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
has	1
belied	1
me	1
to	1
your	1
honour."	1
"No	1
man	1
has	1
belied	1
you,	1
Mr.	1
Cox,	1
but	1
your	1
nose	1
belies	1
you	1
much,	1
if	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
love	1
drinking	1
a	1
little,	1
and	1
your	1
black	1
eye	1
and	1
cut	1
chin	1
belie	1
you	1
much	1
if	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
love	1
quarrelling	1
a	1
little."	1
"Quarrel!	1
I	1
quarrel,	1
please	1
your	1
honour!	1
I	1
defy	1
any	1
man,	1
or	1
set	1
of	1
men,	1
ten	1
mile	1
round,	1
to	1
prove	1
such	1
a	1
thing,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
ready	1
to	1
fight	1
him	1
that	1
dares	1
to	1
say	1
the	1
like	1
of	1
me.	1
I'd	1
fight	1
him	1
here	1
in	1
your	1
honour's	1
presence,	1
if	1
he'd	1
only	1
come	1
out	1
this	1
minute,	1
and	1
meet	1
me	1
like	1
a	1
man."	1
Here	1
Mr.	1
Cox	1
put	1
himself	1
into	1
a	1
boxing	1
attitude,	1
but	1
observing	1
that	1
Mr.	1
Somerville	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
threatening	1
gesture	1
with	1
a	1
smile,	1
and	1
that	1
several	1
people,	1
who	1
had	1
gathered	1
round	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
street,	1
laughed	1
at	1
the	1
proof	1
he	1
gave	1
of	1
his	1
peaceable	1
disposition,	1
he	1
changed	1
his	1
attitude,	1
and	1
went	1
on	1
to	1
vindicate	1
himself	1
against	1
the	1
charge	1
of	1
drinking.	1
"And	1
as	1
to	1
drink,	1
please	1
your	1
honour,	1
there's	1
no	1
truth	1
in	1
it.	1
Not	1
a	1
drop	1
of	1
whisky,	1
good	1
or	1
bad,	1
have	1
I	1
touched	1
these	1
six	1
months,	1
except	1
what	1
I	1
took	1
with	1
Jemmy	1
M'Doole	1
the	1
night	1
I	1
had	1
the	1
misfortune	1
to	1
meet	1
your	1
honour	1
coming	1
home	1
from	1
the	1
fair	1
of	1
Ballynagrish."	1
To	1
this	1
speech	1
Mr.	1
Somerville	1
made	1
no	1
answer,	1
but	1
turned	1
away	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
bow	1
window	1
of	1
a	1
handsome	1
new	1
inn,	1
which	1
the	1
glazier	1
was	1
at	1
this	1
instant	1
glazing.	1
"Please	1
your	1
honour,	1
that	1
new	1
inn	1
is	1
not	1
let,	1
I	1
hear,	1
as	1
yet,"	1
resumed	1
Mr.	1
Cox;	1
"if	1
your	1
honour	1
recollects,	1
you	1
promised	1
to	1
make	1
me	1
a	1
compliment	1
of	1
it	1
last	1
Seraphtide	1
was	1
twelvemonth."	1
"Impossible!"	1
cried	1
Mr.	1
Somerville,	1
"for	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
thoughts	1
of	1
building	1
an	1
inn	1
at	1
that	1
time."	1
"Oh,	1
I	1
beg	1
your	1
honour's	1
pardon	1
but	1
if	1
you'd	1
be	1
just	1
pleased	1
to	1
recollect,	1
it	1
was	1
coming	1
through	1
the	1
gap	1
in	1
the	1
bog	1
meadows,	1
FORENENT	1
Thady	1
O'Connor,	1
you	1
made	1
me	1
the	1
promise--I'll	1
leave	1
it	1
to	1
him,	1
so	1
I	1
will."	1
"But	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
leave	1
it	1
to	1
him,	1
I	1
assure	1
you,"	1
cried	1
Mr.	1
Somerville;	1
"I	1
never	1
made	1
any	1
such	1
promise.	1
I	1
never	1
thought	1
of	1
letting	1
this	1
inn	1
to	1
you."	1
"Then	1
your	1
honour	1
won't	1
let	1
me	1
have	1
it?"	1
"No,	1
you	1
have	1
told	1
me	1
a	1
dozen	1
falsehoods.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
have	1
you	1
for	1
a	1
tenant."	1
"Well,	1
God	1
bless	1
your	1
honour;	1
I've	1
no	1
more	1
to	1
say,	1
but	1
God	1
bless	1
your	1
honour,"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Cox;	1
and	1
he	1
walked	1
away,	1
muttering	1
to	1
himself,	1
as	1
he	1
slouched	1
his	1
hat	1
over	1
his	1
face,	1
"I	1
hope	1
I'll	1
live	1
to	1
be	1
revenged	1
on	1
him!"	1
Mr.	1
Somerville	1
the	1
next	1
morning	1
went	1
with	1
his	1
family	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
new	1
inn,	1
which	1
he	1
expected	1
to	1
see	1
perfectly	1
finished;	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
met	1
by	1
the	1
carpenter,	1
who,	1
with	1
a	1
rueful	1
face,	1
informed	1
him	1
that	1
six	1
panes	1
of	1
glass	1
in	1
the	1
large	1
bow-window	1
had	1
been	1
broken	1
during	1
the	1
night.	1
"Ha!	1
perhaps	1
Mr.	1
Cox	1
has	1
broken	1
my	1
windows,	1
in	1
revenge	1
for	1
my	1
refusing	1
to	1
let	1
him	1
my	1
house,"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Somerville;	1
and	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
neighbours,	1
who	1
knew	1
the	1
malicious	1
character	1
of	1
this	1
Mr.	1
Cox,	1
observed	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
like	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
tricks.	1
A	1
boy	1
of	1
about	1
twelve	1
years	1
old,	1
however,	1
stepped	1
forward	1
and	1
said,	1
"I	1
don't	1
like	1
Mr.	1
Cox,	1
I'm	1
sure;	1
for	1
once	1
he	1
beat	1
me	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
drunk;	1
but,	1
for	1
all	1
that,	1
no	1
one	1
should	1
be	1
accused	1
wrongfully.	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
the	1
person	1
that	1
broke	1
these	1
windows	1
last	1
night,	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
six	1
miles	1
off.	1
He	1
slept	1
at	1
his	1
cousin's	1
last	1
night,	1
and	1
he	1
has	1
not	1
returned	1
home	1
yet.	1
So	1
I	1
think	1
he	1
knows	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
matter."	1
Mr.	1
Somerville	1
was	1
pleased	1
with	1
the	1
honest	1
simplicity	1
of	1
this	1
boy,	1
and	1
observing	1
that	1
he	1
looked	1
in	1
eagerly	1
at	1
the	1
staircase,	1
when	1
the	1
house	1
door	1
was	1
opened,	1
he	1
asked	1
him	1
whether	1
he	1
would	1
like	1
to	1
go	1
in	1
and	1
see	1
the	1
new	1
house.	1
"Yes,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
the	1
boy,	1
"I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
go	1
up	1
those	1
stairs,	1
and	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
I	1
should	1
come	1
to."	1
"Up	1
with	1
you,	1
then!"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Somerville;	1
and	1
the	1
boy	1
ran	1
up	1
the	1
stairs.	1
He	1
went	1
from	1
room	1
to	1
room	1
with	1
great	1
expressions	1
of	1
admiration	1
and	1
delight.	1
At	1
length,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
examining	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
garrets,	1
he	1
was	1
startled	1
by	1
a	1
fluttering	1
noise	1
over	1
his	1
head;	1
and	1
looking	1
up,	1
he	1
saw	1
a	1
white	1
pigeon,	1
who,	1
frightened	1
at	1
his	1
appearance,	1
began	1
to	1
fly	1
round	1
and	1
round	1
the	1
room,	1
till	1
it	1
found	1
its	1
way	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
flew	1
into	1
the	1
staircase.	1
The	1
carpenter	1
was	1
speaking	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Somerville	1
upon	1
the	1
landing-place	1
of	1
the	1
stairs;	1
but,	1
the	1
moment	1
he	1
spied	1
the	1
white	1
pigeon,	1
he	1
broke	1
off	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
a	1
speech	1
about	1
THE	1
NOSE	1
of	1
the	1
stairs,	1
and	1
exclaimed,	1
"There	1
he	1
is,	1
please	1
your	1
honour!	1
There's	1
he	1
that	1
has	1
done	1
all	1
the	1
damage	1
to	1
our	1
bow-window--that's	1
the	1
very	1
same	1
wicked	1
white	1
pigeon	1
that	1
broke	1
the	1
church	1
windows	1
last	1
Sunday	1
was	1
se'nnight;	1
but	1
he's	1
down	1
for	1
it	1
now;	1
we	1
have	1
him	1
safe,	1
and	1
I'll	1
chop	1
his	1
head	1
off,	1
as	1
he	1
deserves,	1
this	1
minute."	1
"Stay!	1
O	1
stay!	1
don't	1
chop	1
his	1
head	1
off:	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
deserve	1
it,"	1
cried	1
the	1
boy,	1
who	1
came	1
running	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
garret	1
with	1
the	1
greatest	1
eagerness--	1
"_I_	1
broke	1
your	1
window,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Somerville.	1
"I	1
broke	1
your	1
window	1
with	1
this	1
ball;	1
but	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
done	1
it,	1
till	1
this	1
moment,	1
I	1
assure	1
you,	1
or	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
told	1
you	1
before.	1
Don't	1
chop	1
his	1
head	1
off,"	1
added	1
the	1
boy	1
to	1
the	1
carpenter,	1
who	1
had	1
now	1
the	1
white	1
pigeon	1
in	1
his	1
hands.	1
"No,"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Somerville,	1
"the	1
pigeon's	1
head	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
chopped	1
off,	1
nor	1
yours	1
either,	1
my	1
good	1
boy,	1
for	1
breaking	1
a	1
window.	1
I	1
am	1
persuaded	1
by	1
your	1
open,	1
honest	1
countenance,	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
speaking	1
the	1
truth;	1
but	1
pray	1
explain	1
this	1
matter	1
to	1
us;	1
for	1
you	1
have	1
not	1
made	1
it	1
quite	1
clear.	1
How	1
happened	1
it	1
that	1
you	1
could	1
break	1
my	1
windows	1
without	1
knowing	1
it?	1
and	1
how	1
came	1
you	1
to	1
find	1
it	1
out	1
at	1
last?"	1
"Sir,"	1
said	1
the	1
boy,	1
"if	1
you'll	1
come	1
up	1
here,	1
I'll	1
show	1
you	1
all	1
I	1
know,	1
and	1
how	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
know	1
it."	1
Mr.	1
Somerville	1
followed	1
the	1
boy	1
into	1
the	1
garret,	1
who	1
pointed	1
to	1
a	1
pane	1
of	1
glass	1
that	1
was	1
broken	1
in	1
a	1
small	1
window	1
that	1
looked	1
out	1
upon	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
waste	1
ground	1
behind	1
the	1
house.	1
Upon	1
this	1
piece	1
of	1
waste	1
ground	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
village	1
often	1
used	1
to	1
play.	1
"We	1
were	1
playing	1
there	1
at	1
ball	1
yesterday	1
evening,"	1
continued	1
the	1
boy,	1
addressing	1
himself	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Somerville,	1
"and	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
lads	1
challenged	1
me	1
to	1
hit	1
a	1
mark	1
in	1
the	1
wall,	1
which	1
I	1
did;	1
but	1
he	1
said	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
hit	1
it,	1
and	1
bade	1
me	1
give	1
him	1
up	1
my	1
ball	1
as	1
the	1
forfeit.	1
This	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
do;	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
wrestle	1
with	1
me	1
for	1
it,	1
I	1
threw	1
the	1
ball,	1
as	1
I	1
thought,	1
over	1
the	1
house.	1
He	1
ran	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
street,	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
find	1
it,	1
which	1
I	1
was	1
very	1
glad	1
of;	1
but	1
I	1
was	1
very	1
sorry	1
just	1
now	1
to	1
find	1
it	1
myself	1
lying	1
upon	1
this	1
heap	1
of	1
shavings,	1
sir,	1
under	1
this	1
broken	1
window;	1
for,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
I	1
saw	1
it	1
lying	1
there,	1
I	1
knew	1
I	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
person	1
that	1
broke	1
the	1
window;	1
and	1
through	1
this	1
window	1
came	1
the	1
white	1
pigeon.	1
Here's	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
white	1
feathers	1
sticking	1
in	1
the	1
gap."	1
"Yes,"	1
said	1
the	1
carpenter,	1
"and	1
in	1
the	1
bow-window	1
room	1
below	1
there's	1
plenty	1
of	1
his	1
feathers	1
to	1
be	1
seen;	1
for	1
I've	1
just	1
been	1
down	1
to	1
look.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
pigeon	1
broke	1
THEM	1
windows,	1
sure	1
enough."	1
"But	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
got	1
in	1
had	1
I	1
not	1
broke	1
this	1
little	1
window,"	1
said	1
the	1
boy,	1
eagerly;	1
"and	1
I	1
am	1
able	1
to	1
earn	1
sixpence	1
a	1
day,	1
and	1
I'll	1
pay	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
mischief,	1
and	1
welcome.	1
The	1
white	1
pigeon	1
belongs	1
to	1
a	1
poor	1
neighbour,	1
a	1
friend	1
of	1
ours,	1
who	1
is	1
very	1
fond	1
of	1
him,	1
and	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
him	1
killed	1
for	1
twice	1
as	1
much	1
money."	1
"Take	1
the	1
pigeon,	1
my	1
honest,	1
generous	1
lad,"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Somerville,	1
"and	1
carry	1
him	1
back	1
to	1
your	1
neighbour.	1
I	1
forgive	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
mischief	1
he	1
has	1
done	1
me,	1
tell	1
your	1
friend,	1
for	1
your	1
sake.	1
As	1
to	1
the	1
rest,	1
we	1
can	1
have	1
the	1
windows	1
mended;	1
and	1
do	1
you	1
keep	1
all	1
the	1
sixpences	1
you	1
earn	1
for	1
yourself."	1
"That's	1
what	1
he	1
never	1
did	1
yet,"	1
said	1
the	1
carpenter.	1
"Many's	1
the	1
sixpence	1
he	1
earns,	1
but	1
not	1
a	1
halfpenny	1
goes	1
into	1
his	1
own	1
pocket:	1
it	1
goes	1
every	1
farthing	1
to	1
his	1
poor	1
father	1
and	1
mother.	1
Happy	1
for	1
them	1
to	1
have	1
such	1
a	1
son!"	1
"More	1
happy	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
have	1
such	1
a	1
father	1
and	1
mother,"	1
exclaimed	1
the	1
boy.	1
"Their	1
good	1
days	1
they	1
took	1
all	1
the	1
best	1
care	1
of	1
me	1
that	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
had	1
for	1
love	1
or	1
money,	1
and	1
would,	1
if	1
I	1
would	1
let	1
them,	1
go	1
on	1
paying	1
for	1
my	1
schooling	1
now,	1
falling	1
as	1
they	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
world;	1
but	1
I	1
must	1
learn	1
to	1
mind	1
the	1
shop	1
now.	1
Good	1
morning	1
to	1
you,	1
sir;	1
and	1
thank	1
you	1
kindly,"	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Somerville.	1
"And	1
where	1
does	1
this	1
boy	1
live,	1
and	1
who	1
are	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
mother?	1
They	1
cannot	1
live	1
in	1
town,"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Somerville,	1
"or	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
them."	1
"They	1
are	1
but	1
just	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
town,	1
please	1
your	1
honour,"	1
said	1
the	1
carpenter.	1
"They	1
lived	1
formerly	1
upon	1
Counsellor	1
O'Donnel's	1
estate;	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
ruined,	1
please	1
your	1
honour,	1
by	1
taking	1
a	1
joint	1
lease	1
with	1
a	1
man,	1
who	1
fell	1
afterwards	1
into	1
bad	1
company,	1
ran	1
out	1
all	1
he	1
had,	1
so	1
could	1
not	1
pay	1
the	1
landlord;	1
and	1
these	1
poor	1
people	1
were	1
forced	1
to	1
pay	1
his	1
share	1
and	1
their	1
own	1
too,	1
which	1
almost	1
ruined	1
them.	1
They	1
were	1
obliged	1
to	1
give	1
up	1
the	1
land;	1
and	1
now	1
they	1
have	1
furnished	1
a	1
little	1
shop	1
in	1
this	1
town	1
with	1
what	1
goods	1
they	1
could	1
afford	1
to	1
buy	1
with	1
the	1
money	1
they	1
got	1
by	1
the	1
sale	1
of	1
their	1
cattle	1
and	1
stock.	1
They	1
have	1
the	1
good-will	1
of	1
all	1
who	1
know	1
them;	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
I	1
hope	1
they	1
will	1
do	1
well.	1
The	1
boy	1
is	1
very	1
ready	1
in	1
the	1
shop,	1
though	1
he	1
said	1
only	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
earn	1
sixpence	1
a	1
day.	1
He	1
writes	1
a	1
good	1
hand,	1
and	1
is	1
quick	1
at	1
casting	1
up	1
accounts,	1
for	1
his	1
age.	1
Besides,	1
he	1
is	1
likely	1
to	1
do	1
well	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
because	1
he	1
is	1
never	1
in	1
idle	1
company,	1
and	1
I've	1
known	1
him	1
since	1
he	1
was	1
two	1
foot	1
high,	1
and	1
never	1
heard	1
of	1
his	1
telling	1
a	1
lie."	1
"This	1
is	1
an	1
excellent	1
character	1
of	1
the	1
boy,	1
indeed,"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Somerville,	1
"and	1
from	1
his	1
behaviour	1
this	1
morning	1
I	1
am	1
inclined	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
he	1
deserves	1
all	1
your	1
praises."	1
Mr.	1
Somerville	1
resolved	1
to	1
inquire	1
more	1
fully	1
concerning	1
this	1
poor	1
family,	1
and	1
to	1
attend	1
to	1
their	1
conduct	1
himself,	1
fully	1
determined	1
to	1
assist	1
them	1
if	1
he	1
should	1
find	1
them	1
such	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
represented.	1
In	1
the	1
meantime,	1
this	1
boy,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Brian	1
O'Neill,	1
went	1
to	1
return	1
the	1
white	1
pigeon	1
to	1
its	1
owner.	1
"You	1
have	1
saved	1
its	1
life,"	1
said	1
the	1
woman	1
to	1
whom	1
it	1
belonged,	1
"and	1
I'll	1
make	1
you	1
a	1
present	1
of	1
it."	1
Brian	1
thanked	1
her;	1
and	1
he	1
from	1
that	1
day	1
began	1
to	1
grow	1
fond	1
of	1
the	1
pigeon.	1
He	1
always	1
took	1
care	1
to	1
scatter	1
some	1
oats	1
for	1
it	1
in	1
his	1
father's	1
yard;	1
and	1
the	1
pigeon	1
grew	1
so	1
tame	1
at	1
last	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
hop	1
about	1
the	1
kitchen,	1
and	1
eat	1
off	1
the	1
same	1
trencher	1
with	1
the	1
dog.	1
Brian,	1
after	1
the	1
shop	1
was	1
shut	1
up	1
at	1
night,	1
used	1
to	1
amuse	1
himself	1
with	1
reading	1
some	1
little	1
books	1
which	1
the	1
schoolmaster	1
who	1
formerly	1
taught	1
him	1
arithmetic	1
was	1
so	1
good	1
as	1
to	1
lend	1
him.	1
Amongst	1
these	1
he	1
one	1
evening	1
met	1
with	1
a	1
little	1
book	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
birds	1
and	1
beasts;	1
he	1
looked	1
immediately	1
to	1
see	1
whether	1
the	1
pigeon	1
was	1
mentioned	1
amongst	1
the	1
birds,	1
and,	1
to	1
his	1
great	1
joy,	1
he	1
found	1
a	1
full	1
description	1
and	1
history	1
of	1
his	1
favourite	1
bird.	1
"So,	1
Brian,	1
I	1
see	1
your	1
schooling	1
has	1
not	1
been	1
thrown	1
away	1
upon	1
you;	1
you	1
like	1
your	1
book,	1
I	1
see,	1
when	1
you	1
have	1
no	1
master	1
over	1
you	1
to	1
bid	1
you	1
read,"	1
said	1
his	1
father,	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
in	1
and	1
saw	1
Brian	1
reading	1
his	1
book	1
very	1
attentively.	1
"Thank	1
you	1
for	1
having	1
me	1
taught	1
to	1
read,	1
father,"	1
said	1
Brian.	1
"Here	1
I've	1
made	1
a	1
great	1
discovery:	1
I've	1
found	1
out	1
in	1
this	1
book,	1
little	1
as	1
it	1
looks,	1
father,	1
a	1
most	1
curious	1
way	1
of	1
making	1
a	1
fortune;	1
and	1
I	1
hope	1
it	1
will	1
make	1
your	1
fortune,	1
father;	1
and	1
if	1
you'll	1
sit	1
down,	1
I'll	1
tell	1
it	1
to	1
you."	1
Mr.	1
O'Neill,	1
in	1
hopes	1
of	1
pleasing	1
his	1
son	1
rather	1
than	1
in	1
the	1
expectation	1
of	1
having	1
his	1
fortune	1
made,	1
immediately	1
sat	1
down	1
to	1
listen;	1
and	1
his	1
son	1
explained	1
to	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
found	1
in	1
his	1
book	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
pigeons	1
who	1
carried	1
notes	1
and	1
letters:	1
"and,	1
father,"	1
continued	1
Brian,	1
"I	1
find	1
my	1
pigeon	1
is	1
of	1
this	1
sort;	1
and	1
I	1
intend	1
to	1
make	1
my	1
pigeon	1
carry	1
messages.	1
Why	1
should	1
not	1
he?	1
If	1
other	1
pigeons	1
have	1
done	1
so	1
before	1
him,	1
I	1
think	1
he	1
is	1
as	1
good,	1
and,	1
I	1
daresay,	1
will	1
be	1
as	1
easy	1
to	1
teach	1
as	1
any	1
pigeon	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
I	1
shall	1
begin	1
to	1
teach	1
him	1
to-morrow	1
morning;	1
and	1
then,	1
father,	1
you	1
know	1
people	1
often	1
pay	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
for	1
sending	1
messengers;	1
and	1
no	1
boy	1
can	1
run,	1
no	1
horse	1
can	1
gallop,	1
so	1
fast	1
as	1
a	1
bird	1
can	1
fly;	1
therefore	1
the	1
bird	1
must	1
be	1
the	1
best	1
messenger,	1
and	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
paid	1
the	1
best	1
price.	1
Hey,	1
father?"	1
"To	1
be	1
sure,	1
to	1
be	1
sure,	1
my	1
boy,"	1
said	1
his	1
father,	1
laughing;	1
"I	1
wish	1
you	1
may	1
make	1
the	1
best	1
messenger	1
in	1
Ireland	1
of	1
your	1
pigeon;	1
but	1
all	1
I	1
beg,	1
my	1
dear	1
boy,	1
is	1
that	1
you	1
won't	1
neglect	1
our	1
shop	1
for	1
your	1
pigeon;	1
for	1
I've	1
a	1
notion	1
we	1
have	1
a	1
better	1
chance	1
of	1
making	1
a	1
fortune	1
by	1
the	1
shop	1
than	1
by	1
the	1
white	1
pigeon."	1
Brian	1
never	1
neglected	1
the	1
shop;	1
but	1
in	1
his	1
leisure	1
hours	1
he	1
amused	1
himself	1
with	1
training	1
his	1
pigeon;	1
and	1
after	1
much	1
patience	1
he	1
at	1
last	1
succeeded	1
so	1
well,	1
that	1
one	1
day	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
offered	1
to	1
send	1
him	1
word	1
by	1
his	1
pigeon	1
what	1
beef	1
was	1
a	1
pound	1
in	1
the	1
market	1
of	1
Ballynagrish,	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
going.	1
"The	1
pigeon	1
will	1
be	1
home	1
long	1
before	1
me,	1
father;	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
come	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
kitchen	1
window,	1
and	1
light	1
upon	1
the	1
dresser;	1
then	1
you	1
must	1
untie	1
the	1
little	1
note	1
which	1
I	1
shall	1
have	1
tied	1
under	1
his	1
left	1
wing,	1
and	1
you'll	1
know	1
the	1
price	1
of	1
beef	1
directly."	1
The	1
pigeon	1
carried	1
his	1
message	1
well;	1
and	1
Brian	1
was	1
much	1
delighted	1
with	1
his	1
success.	1
He	1
soon	1
was	1
employed	1
by	1
the	1
neighbours,	1
who	1
were	1
aroused	1
by	1
Brian's	1
fondness	1
of	1
his	1
swift	1
messenger;	1
and	1
soon	1
the	1
fame	1
of	1
the	1
white	1
pigeon	1
was	1
spread	1
amongst	1
all	1
who	1
frequented	1
the	1
markets	1
and	1
fairs	1
of	1
Somerville.	1
At	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
fairs	1
a	1
set	1
of	1
men	1
of	1
desperate	1
fortunes	1
met	1
to	1
drink,	1
and	1
to	1
concert	1
plans	1
of	1
robberies.	1
Their	1
place	1
of	1
meeting	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
ale-house	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Cox,	1
the	1
man	1
who,	1
as	1
our	1
readers	1
may	1
remember,	1
was	1
offended	1
by	1
Mr.	1
Somerville's	1
hinting	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
fond	1
of	1
drinking	1
and	1
of	1
quarrelling,	1
and	1
who	1
threatened	1
vengeance	1
for	1
having	1
been	1
refused	1
the	1
new	1
inn.	1
Whilst	1
these	1
men	1
were	1
talking	1
over	1
their	1
scheme,	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
observed,	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
their	1
companions	1
was	1
not	1
arrived.	1
Another	1
said,	1
"No."	1
"He's	1
six	1
miles	1
off,"	1
said	1
another;	1
and	1
a	1
third	1
wished	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
make	1
him	1
hear	1
at	1
that	1
distance.	1
This	1
turned	1
the	1
discourse	1
upon	1
the	1
difficulties	1
of	1
sending	1
messages	1
secretly	1
and	1
quickly.	1
Cox's	1
son,	1
a	1
lad	1
of	1
about	1
nineteen,	1
who	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
this	1
gang,	1
mentioned	1
the	1
white	1
carrier-pigeon,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
desired	1
to	1
try	1
all	1
means	1
to	1
get	1
it	1
into	1
his	1
possession.	1
Accordingly,	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
young	1
Cox	1
went	1
to	1
Brian	1
O'Neill,	1
and	1
tried,	1
at	1
first	1
by	1
persuasion	1
and	1
afterwards	1
by	1
threats,	1
to	1
prevail	1
upon	1
him	1
to	1
give	1
up	1
the	1
pigeon.	1
Brian	1
was	1
resolute	1
in	1
his	1
refusal,	1
more	1
especially	1
when	1
the	1
petitioner	1
began	1
to	1
bully	1
him.	1
"If	1
we	1
can't	1
have	1
it	1
by	1
fair	1
means,	1
we	1
will	1
by	1
foul,"	1
said	1
Cox;	1
and	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
afterwards	1
the	1
pigeon	1
was	1
gone.	1
Brian	1
searched	1
for	1
it	1
in	1
vain--	1
inquired	1
from	1
all	1
the	1
neighbours	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
seen	1
it,	1
and	1
applied,	1
but	1
to	1
no	1
purpose,	1
to	1
Cox.	1
He	1
swore	1
that	1
he	1
knew	1
nothing	1
about	1
the	1
matter.	1
But	1
this	1
was	1
false,	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
he	1
who	1
during	1
the	1
night-time	1
had	1
stolen	1
the	1
white	1
pigeon.	1
He	1
conveyed	1
it	1
to	1
his	1
employers,	1
and	1
they	1
rejoiced	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
gotten	1
it	1
into	1
their	1
possession,	1
as	1
they	1
thought	1
it	1
would	1
serve	1
them	1
for	1
a	1
useful	1
messenger.	1
Nothing	1
can	1
be	1
more	1
shortsighted	1
than	1
cunning.	1
The	1
very	1
means	1
which	1
these	1
people	1
took	1
to	1
secure	1
secrecy	1
were	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
bringing	1
their	1
plots	1
to	1
light.	1
They	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
teach	1
the	1
pigeon,	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
stolen,	1
to	1
carry	1
messages	1
for	1
them	1
in	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
at	1
some	1
distance	1
from	1
Somerville;	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
fancied	1
that	1
it	1
had	1
forgotten	1
its	1
former	1
habits,	1
and	1
its	1
old	1
master,	1
they	1
thought	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
venture	1
to	1
employ	1
him	1
nearer	1
home.	1
The	1
pigeon,	1
however,	1
had	1
a	1
better	1
memory	1
than	1
they	1
imagined.	1
They	1
loosed	1
him	1
from	1
a	1
bag	1
near	1
the	1
town	1
of	1
Ballynagrish	1
in	1
hopes	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
stop	1
at	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Cox's	1
cousin,	1
which	1
was	1
on	1
its	1
road	1
between	1
Ballynagrish	1
and	1
Somerville.	1
But	1
the	1
pigeon,	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
purposely	1
fed	1
at	1
this	1
house	1
for	1
a	1
week	1
before	1
this	1
trial,	1
did	1
not	1
stop	1
there,	1
but	1
flew	1
on	1
to	1
his	1
old	1
master's	1
house	1
in	1
Somerville,	1
and	1
pecked	1
at	1
the	1
kitchen	1
window,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
formerly	1
been	1
taught	1
to	1
do.	1
His	1
father,	1
fortunately,	1
was	1
within	1
hearing,	1
and	1
poor	1
Brian	1
ran	1
with	1
the	1
greatest	1
joy	1
to	1
open	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
to	1
let	1
him	1
in.	1
"O,	1
father,	1
here's	1
my	1
white	1
pigeon	1
come	1
back	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
accord,"	1
exclaimed	1
Brian;	1
"I	1
must	1
run	1
and	1
show	1
him	1
to	1
my	1
mother."	1
At	1
this	1
instant	1
the	1
pigeon	1
spread	1
his	1
wings,	1
and	1
Brian	1
discovered	1
under	1
one	1
of	1
its	1
wings	1
a	1
small	1
and	1
very	1
dirty	1
looking	1
billet.	1
He	1
opened	1
it	1
in	1
his	1
father's	1
presence.	1
The	1
scrawl	1
was	1
scarcely	1
legible;	1
but	1
these	1
words	1
were	1
at	1
length	1
deciphered:--	1
"Thare	1
are	1
eight	1
of	1
uz	1
sworn;	1
I	1
send	1
yo	1
at	1
botom	1
thare	1
names.	1
We	1
meat	1
at	1
tin	1
this	1
nite	1
at	1
my	1
faders,	1
and	1
have	1
harms	1
and	1
all	1
in	1
radiness	1
to	1
brak	1
into	1
the	1
grate	1
'ouse.	1
Mr.	1
Summervill	1
is	1
to	1
lye	1
out	1
to	1
nite--kip	1
the	1
pigeon	1
untill	1
to-morrow.	1
For	1
ever	1
yours,	1
MURTAGH	1
COX,	1
JUN."	1
Scarcely	1
had	1
they	1
finished	1
reading	1
this	1
note,	1
than	1
both	1
father	1
and	1
son	1
exclaimed,	1
"Let	1
us	1
go	1
and	1
show	1
it	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Somerville."	1
Before	1
they	1
set	1
out,	1
they	1
had,	1
however,	1
the	1
prudence	1
to	1
secure	1
the	1
pigeon,	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
seen	1
by	1
anyone	1
but	1
themselves.	1
Mr.	1
Somerville,	1
in	1
consequence	1
of	1
this	1
fortunate	1
discovery,	1
took	1
proper	1
measures	1
for	1
the	1
apprehension	1
of	1
the	1
eight	1
men	1
who	1
had	1
sworn	1
to	1
rob	1
his	1
house.	1
When	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
safely	1
lodged	1
in	1
the	1
county	1
gaol,	1
he	1
sent	1
for	1
Brian	1
O'Neill	1
and	1
his	1
father;	1
and	1
after	1
thanking	1
them	1
for	1
the	1
service	1
they	1
had	1
done	1
him,	1
he	1
counted	1
out	1
ten	1
bright	1
guineas	1
upon	1
a	1
table,	1
and	1
pushed	1
them	1
towards	1
Brian,	1
saying,	1
"I	1
suppose	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
a	1
reward	1
of	1
ten	1
guineas	1
was	1
offered	1
some	1
weeks	1
ago	1
for	1
the	1
discovery	1
of	1
John	1
Mac	1
Dermod,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
eight	1
men	1
whom	1
we	1
have	1
just	1
taken	1
up?"	1
"No,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
Brian;	1
"I	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
it,	1
and	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
bring	1
that	1
note	1
to	1
you	1
to	1
get	1
ten	1
guineas,	1
but	1
because	1
I	1
thought	1
it	1
was	1
right.	1
I	1
don't	1
want	1
to	1
be	1
paid	1
for	1
doing	1
it."	1
"That's	1
my	1
own	1
boy,"	1
said	1
his	1
father.	1
"We	1
thank	1
you,	1
sir;	1
but	1
we'll	1
not	1
take	1
the	1
money;	1
I	1
DON'T	1
LIKE	1
TO	1
TAKE	1
THE	1
PRICE	1
OF	1
BLOOD."	1
"I	1
know	1
the	1
difference,	1
my	1
good	1
friends,"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Somerville,	1
"between	1
vile	1
informers	1
and	1
courageous,	1
honest	1
men."	1
"Why,	1
as	1
to	1
that,	1
please	1
your	1
honour,	1
though	1
we	1
are	1
poor,	1
I	1
hope	1
we	1
are	1
honest."	1
"And,	1
what	1
is	1
more,"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Somerville,	1
"I	1
have	1
a	1
notion	1
that	1
you	1
would	1
continue	1
to	1
be	1
honest,	1
even	1
if	1
you	1
were	1
rich.	1
Will	1
you,	1
my	1
good	1
lad,"	1
continued	1
Mr.	1
Somerville,	1
after	1
a	1
moment's	1
pause--"will	1
you	1
trust	1
me	1
with	1
your	1
pigeon	1
a	1
few	1
days?"	1
"O,	1
and	1
welcome,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
the	1
boy,	1
with	1
a	1
smile;	1
and	1
he	1
brought	1
the	1
pigeon	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Somerville	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
dark,	1
and	1
nobody	1
saw	1
him.	1
A	1
few	1
days	1
afterwards,	1
Mr.	1
Somerville	1
called	1
at	1
O'Neill's	1
house,	1
and	1
bid	1
him	1
and	1
his	1
son	1
follow	1
him.	1
They	1
followed	1
till	1
he	1
stopped	1
opposite	1
to	1
the	1
bow-window	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
inn.	1
The	1
carpenter	1
had	1
just	1
put	1
up	1
a	1
sign,	1
which	1
was	1
covered	1
over	1
with	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
carpeting.	1
"Go	1
up	1
the	1
ladder,	1
will	1
you?"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Somerville	1
to	1
Brian,	1
"and	1
pull	1
that	1
sign	1
straight,	1
for	1
it	1
hangs	1
quite	1
crooked.	1
There,	1
now	1
it	1
is	1
straight.	1
Now	1
pull	1
off	1
the	1
carpet,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
see	1
the	1
new	1
sign."	1
The	1
boy	1
pulled	1
off	1
the	1
cover,	1
and	1
saw	1
a	1
white	1
pigeon	1
painted	1
upon	1
the	1
sign,	1
and	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
O'Neill	1
in	1
large	1
letters	1
underneath.	1
"Take	1
care	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
tumble	1
down	1
and	1
break	1
your	1
neck	1
upon	1
this	1
joyful	1
occasion,"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Somerville,	1
who	1
saw	1
that	1
Brian's	1
surprise	1
was	1
too	1
great	1
for	1
his	1
situation.	1
"Come	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
ladder,	1
and	1
wish	1
your	1
father	1
joy	1
of	1
being	1
master	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
inn	1
called	1
the	1
'White	1
Pigeon.'	1
And	1
I	1
wish	1
him	1
joy	1
of	1
having	1
such	1
a	1
son	1
as	1
you	1
are.	1
Those	1
who	1
bring	1
up	1
their	1
children	1
well,	1
will	1
certainly	1
be	1
rewarded	1
for	1
it,	1
be	1
they	1
poor	1
or	1
rich."	1
THE	1
BIRTHDAY	1
PRESENT.	1
"Mamma,"	1
said	1
Rosamond,	1
after	1
a	1
long	1
silence,	1
"do	1
you	1
know	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
thinking	1
of	1
all	1
this	1
time?"	1
"No,	1
my	1
dear.--What?"	1
"Why,	1
mamma,	1
about	1
my	1
cousin	1
Bell's	1
birthday;	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
what	1
day	1
it	1
is?"	1
"No,	1
I	1
don't	1
remember."	1
"Dear	1
mother!	1
don't	1
you	1
remember	1
it's	1
the	1
22nd	1
of	1
December;	1
and	1
her	1
birthday	1
is	1
the	1
day	1
after	1
to-morrow?	1
Don't	1
you	1
recollect	1
now?	1
But	1
you	1
never	1
remember	1
about	1
birthdays,	1
mamma.	1
That	1
was	1
just	1
what	1
I	1
was	1
thinking	1
of,	1
that	1
you	1
never	1
remember	1
my	1
sister	1
Laura's	1
birthday,	1
or-or-or	1
MINE,	1
mamma."	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
mean	1
my	1
dear?	1
I	1
remember	1
your	1
birthday	1
perfectly	1
well."	1
"Indeed!	1
but	1
you	1
never	1
KEEP	1
it,	1
though."	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
mean	1
by	1
keeping	1
your	1
birthday?"	1
"Oh,	1
mamma,	1
you	1
know	1
very	1
well--as	1
Bell's	1
birthday	1
is	1
kept.	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
place,	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
dinner."	1
"And	1
can	1
Bell	1
eat	1
more	1
upon	1
her	1
birthday	1
than	1
upon	1
any	1
other	1
day?"	1
"No;	1
nor	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
mind	1
about	1
the	1
dinner,	1
except	1
the	1
mince-pies.	1
But	1
Bell	1
has	1
a	1
great	1
many	1
nice	1
things--I	1
don't	1
mean	1
nice	1
eatable	1
things,	1
but	1
nice	1
new	1
playthings,	1
given	1
to	1
her	1
always	1
on	1
her	1
birthday;	1
and	1
everybody	1
drinks	1
her	1
health,	1
and	1
she's	1
so	1
happy."	1
"But	1
stay,	1
Rosamond,	1
how	1
you	1
jumble	1
things	1
together!	1
Is	1
it	1
everybody's	1
drinking	1
her	1
health	1
that	1
makes	1
her	1
so	1
happy?	1
or	1
the	1
new	1
playthings,	1
or	1
the	1
nice	1
mince	1
pies?	1
I	1
can	1
easily	1
believe	1
that	1
she	1
is	1
happy	1
whilst	1
she	1
is	1
eating	1
a	1
mince	1
pie,	1
or	1
whilst	1
she	1
is	1
playing;	1
but	1
how	1
does	1
everybody's	1
drinking	1
her	1
health	1
at	1
dinner	1
make	1
her	1
happy?"	1
Rosamond	1
paused,	1
and	1
then	1
said	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
know.	1
"But,"	1
added	1
she,	1
"the	1
NICE	1
NEW	1
playthings,	1
mother!"	1
"But	1
why	1
the	1
nice	1
new	1
playthings?	1
Do	1
you	1
like	1
them	1
only	1
because	1
they	1
are	1
NEW?"	1
"Not	1
ONLY--_I_	1
do	1
not	1
like	1
playthings	1
ONLY	1
because	1
they	1
are	1
new;	1
but	1
Bell	1
DOES,	1
I	1
believe--for	1
that	1
puts	1
me	1
in	1
mind--Do	1
you	1
know,	1
mother,	1
she	1
had	1
a	1
great	1
drawer	1
full	1
of	1
OLD	1
playthings	1
that	1
she	1
never	1
used,	1
and	1
she	1
said	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
good	1
for	1
nothing,	1
because	1
they	1
were	1
OLD;	1
but	1
I	1
thought	1
many	1
of	1
them	1
were	1
good	1
for	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
new	1
ones.	1
Now	1
you	1
shall	1
be	1
judge,	1
mamma;	1
I'll	1
tell	1
you	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
drawer."	1
"Nay,	1
Rosamond,	1
thank	1
you,	1
not	1
just	1
now;	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
time	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
you."	1
"Well	1
then,	1
mamma,	1
the	1
day	1
after	1
to-morrow	1
I	1
can	1
show	1
you	1
the	1
drawer.	1
I	1
want	1
you	1
to	1
judge	1
very	1
much,	1
because	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
right.	1
And,	1
mother,"	1
added	1
Rosamond,	1
stopping	1
her	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
going	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room,	1
"will	1
you--not	1
now,	1
but	1
when	1
you've	1
time--will	1
you	1
tell	1
me	1
why	1
you	1
never	1
keep	1
my	1
birthday--why	1
you	1
never	1
make	1
any	1
difference	1
between	1
that	1
day	1
and	1
any	1
other	1
day?"	1
"And	1
will	1
you,	1
Rosamond--not	1
now,	1
but	1
when	1
you	1
have	1
time	1
to	1
think	1
about	1
it--tell	1
me	1
why	1
I	1
should	1
make	1
any	1
difference	1
between	1
your	1
birthday	1
and	1
any	1
other	1
day?"	1
Rosamond	1
thought,	1
but	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
find	1
out	1
any	1
reason;	1
besides,	1
she	1
suddenly	1
recollected	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
time	1
to	1
think	1
any	1
longer;	1
for	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
certain	1
work-basket	1
to	1
be	1
finished,	1
which	1
she	1
was	1
making	1
for	1
her	1
cousin	1
Bell,	1
as	1
a	1
present	1
upon	1
her	1
birthday.	1
The	1
work	1
was	1
at	1
a	1
stand	1
for	1
want	1
of	1
some	1
filigree-paper,	1
and,	1
as	1
her	1
mother	1
was	1
going	1
out,	1
she	1
asked	1
her	1
to	1
take	1
her	1
with	1
her,	1
that	1
she	1
might	1
buy	1
some.	1
Her	1
sister	1
Laura	1
went	1
with	1
them.	1
"Sister,"	1
said	1
Rosamond,	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
walking	1
along,	1
"what	1
have	1
you	1
done	1
with	1
your	1
half-guinea?"	1
"I	1
have	1
it	1
in	1
my	1
pocket."	1
"Dear!	1
you	1
will	1
keep	1
it	1
for	1
ever	1
in	1
your	1
pocket.	1
You	1
know,	1
my	1
godmother	1
when	1
she	1
gave	1
it	1
to	1
you,	1
said	1
you	1
would	1
keep	1
it	1
longer	1
than	1
I	1
should	1
keep	1
mine;	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
what	1
she	1
thought	1
by	1
her	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
time.	1
I	1
heard	1
her	1
say	1
something	1
to	1
my	1
mother."	1
"Yes,"	1
said	1
Laura,	1
smiling;	1
"she	1
whispered	1
so	1
loud	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
hearing	1
her	1
too.	1
She	1
said	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
miser."	1
"But	1
did	1
not	1
you	1
hear	1
her	1
say	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
very	1
GENEROUS?	1
and	1
she'll	1
see	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
mistaken.	1
I	1
hope	1
she'll	1
be	1
by	1
when	1
I	1
give	1
my	1
basket	1
to	1
Bell--won't	1
it	1
be	1
beautiful?	1
There	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
wreath	1
of	1
myrtle,	1
you	1
know,	1
round	1
the	1
handle,	1
and	1
a	1
frost	1
ground,	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
medallions--"	1
"Stay,"	1
interrupted	1
her	1
sister,	1
for	1
Rosamond,	1
anticipating	1
the	1
glories	1
of	1
her	1
work-basket,	1
talked	1
and	1
walked	1
so	1
fast	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
passed,	1
without	1
perceiving	1
it,	1
the	1
shop	1
where	1
the	1
filigree-paper	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
bought.	1
They	1
turned	1
back.	1
Now	1
it	1
happened	1
that	1
the	1
shop	1
was	1
the	1
corner	1
house	1
of	1
a	1
street,	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
windows	1
looked	1
out	1
into	1
a	1
narrow	1
lane.	1
A	1
coach	1
full	1
of	1
ladies	1
stopped	1
at	1
the	1
door,	1
just	1
before	1
they	1
went	1
in,	1
so	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
had	1
time	1
immediately	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
Rosamond	1
and	1
her	1
filigree-paper,	1
and	1
she	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
window	1
where	1
she	1
saw	1
her	1
sister	1
Laura	1
looking	1
earnestly	1
at	1
something	1
that	1
was	1
passing	1
in	1
the	1
lane.	1
Opposite	1
to	1
the	1
window,	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
a	1
poor-looking	1
house,	1
there	1
was	1
sitting	1
a	1
little	1
girl	1
weaving	1
lace.	1
Her	1
bobbins	1
moved	1
as	1
quick	1
as	1
lightning,	1
and	1
she	1
never	1
once	1
looked	1
up	1
from	1
her	1
work.	1
"Is	1
not	1
she	1
very	1
industrious?"	1
said	1
Laura;	1
"and	1
very	1
honest,	1
too?"	1
added	1
she	1
in	1
a	1
minute	1
afterwards;	1
for	1
just	1
then	1
a	1
baker	1
with	1
a	1
basket	1
of	1
rolls	1
on	1
his	1
head	1
passed,	1
and	1
by	1
accident	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
rolls	1
fell	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
little	1
girl.	1
She	1
took	1
it	1
up	1
eagerly,	1
looked	1
at	1
it	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
was	1
very	1
hungry,	1
then	1
put	1
aside	1
her	1
work,	1
and	1
ran	1
after	1
the	1
baker	1
to	1
return	1
it	1
to	1
him.	1
Whilst	1
she	1
was	1
gone,	1
a	1
footman	1
in	1
a	1
livery,	1
laced	1
with	1
silver,	1
who	1
belonged	1
to	1
the	1
coach	1
that	1
stood	1
at	1
the	1
shop	1
door,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
lounging	1
with	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
companions,	1
chanced	1
to	1
spy	1
the	1
weaving	1
pillow,	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
left	1
upon	1
a	1
stone	1
before	1
the	1
door.	1
To	1
divert	1
himself	1
(for	1
idle	1
people	1
do	1
mischief	1
often	1
to	1
divert	1
themselves)	1
he	1
took	1
up	1
the	1
pillow,	1
and	1
entangled	1
all	1
the	1
bobbins.	1
The	1
little	1
girl	1
came	1
back	1
out	1
of	1
breath	1
to	1
her	1
work;	1
but	1
what	1
was	1
her	1
surprise	1
and	1
sorrow	1
to	1
find	1
it	1
spoiled.	1
She	1
twisted	1
and	1
untwisted,	1
placed	1
and	1
replaced,	1
the	1
bobbins,	1
while	1
the	1
footman	1
stood	1
laughing	1
at	1
her	1
distress.	1
She	1
got	1
up	1
gently,	1
and	1
was	1
retiring	1
into	1
the	1
house,	1
when	1
the	1
silver	1
laced	1
footman	1
stopped	1
her,	1
saying,	1
insolently,	1
"Sit	1
still,	1
child."	1
"I	1
must	1
go	1
to	1
my	1
mother,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
the	1
child;	1
"besides,	1
you	1
have	1
spoiled	1
all	1
my	1
lace.	1
I	1
can't	1
stay."	1
"Can't	1
you?"	1
said	1
the	1
brutal	1
footman,	1
snatching	1
her	1
weaving-pillow	1
again,	1
"I'll	1
teach	1
you	1
to	1
complain	1
of	1
me."	1
And	1
he	1
broke	1
off,	1
one	1
after	1
another,	1
all	1
the	1
bobbins,	1
put	1
them	1
into	1
his	1
pocket,	1
rolled	1
her	1
weaving-pillow	1
down	1
the	1
dirty	1
lane,	1
then	1
jumped	1
up	1
behind	1
his	1
mistress'	1
coach,	1
and	1
was	1
out	1
of	1
sight	1
in	1
an	1
instant.	1
"Poor	1
girl!"	1
exclaimed	1
Rosamond,	1
no	1
longer	1
able	1
to	1
restrain	1
her	1
indignation	1
at	1
this	1
injustice;	1
"poor	1
little	1
girl!"	1
At	1
this	1
instant	1
her	1
mother	1
said	1
to	1
Rosamond--"Come,	1
now,	1
my	1
dear,	1
if	1
you	1
want	1
this	1
filigree	1
paper,	1
buy	1
it."	1
"Yes,	1
madam,"	1
said	1
Rosamond;	1
and	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
what	1
her	1
godmother	1
and	1
her	1
cousin	1
Bell	1
would	1
think	1
of	1
her	1
generosity	1
rushed	1
again	1
upon	1
her	1
imagination.	1
All	1
her	1
feelings	1
of	1
pity	1
were	1
immediately	1
suppressed.	1
Satisfied	1
with	1
bestowing	1
another	1
exclamation	1
upon	1
the	1
"Poor	1
little	1
girl!"	1
she	1
went	1
to	1
spend	1
her	1
half-guinea	1
upon	1
her	1
filigree	1
basket.	1
In	1
the	1
meantime,	1
she	1
that	1
was	1
called	1
the	1
"little	1
miser"	1
beckoned	1
to	1
the	1
poor	1
girl,	1
and,	1
opening	1
the	1
window,	1
said,	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
cushion,	1
"Is	1
it	1
quite	1
spoiled?"	1
"Quite!	1
quite	1
spoiled!	1
and	1
I	1
can't,	1
nor	1
mother	1
neither,	1
buy	1
another;	1
and	1
I	1
can't	1
do	1
anything	1
else	1
for	1
my	1
bread."	1
A	1
few,	1
but	1
very	1
few,	1
tears	1
fell	1
as	1
she	1
said	1
this.	1
"How	1
much	1
would	1
another	1
cost?"	1
said	1
Laura.	1
"Oh,	1
a	1
great--GREAT	1
deal."	1
"More	1
than	1
that?"	1
said	1
Laura,	1
holding	1
up	1
her	1
half-guinea.	1
"Oh,	1
no."	1
"Then	1
you	1
can	1
buy	1
another	1
with	1
that,"	1
said	1
Laura,	1
dropping	1
the	1
half-	1
guinea	1
into	1
her	1
hand;	1
and	1
she	1
shut	1
the	1
window	1
before	1
the	1
child	1
could	1
find	1
words	1
to	1
thank	1
her,	1
but	1
not	1
before	1
she	1
saw	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
joy	1
and	1
gratitude,	1
which	1
gave	1
Laura	1
more	1
pleasure	1
probably	1
than	1
all	1
the	1
praise	1
which	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
bestowed	1
upon	1
her	1
generosity.	1
Late	1
on	1
the	1
morning	1
of	1
her	1
cousin's	1
birthday,	1
Rosamond	1
finished	1
her	1
work-	1
basket.	1
The	1
carriage	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
door--Laura	1
came	1
running	1
to	1
call	1
her;	1
her	1
father's	1
voice	1
was	1
heard	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
instant;	1
so	1
she	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
go	1
down	1
with	1
her	1
basket	1
but	1
half	1
wrapped	1
up	1
in	1
silver	1
paper--a	1
circumstance	1
at	1
which	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
disconcerted;	1
for	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
surprising	1
Bell	1
would	1
be	1
utterly	1
lost	1
if	1
one	1
bit	1
of	1
the	1
filigree	1
should	1
peep	1
out	1
before	1
the	1
proper	1
time.	1
As	1
the	1
carriage	1
went	1
on,	1
Rosamond	1
pulled	1
the	1
paper	1
to	1
one	1
side	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
other,	1
and	1
by	1
each	1
of	1
the	1
four	1
corners.	1
"It	1
will	1
never	1
do,	1
my	1
dear,"	1
said	1
her	1
father,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
watching	1
her	1
operations.	1
"I	1
am	1
afraid	1
you	1
will	1
never	1
make	1
a	1
sheet	1
of	1
paper	1
cover	1
a	1
box	1
which	1
is	1
twice	1
as	1
large	1
as	1
itself."	1
"It	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
box,	1
father,"	1
said	1
Rosamond,	1
a	1
little	1
peevishly;	1
"it's	1
a	1
basket."	1
"Let	1
us	1
look	1
at	1
this	1
basket,"	1
said	1
he,	1
taking	1
it	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
unwilling	1
hands,	1
for	1
she	1
knew	1
of	1
what	1
frail	1
materials	1
it	1
was	1
made,	1
and	1
she	1
dreaded	1
its	1
coming	1
to	1
pieces	1
under	1
her	1
father's	1
examination.	1
He	1
took	1
hold	1
of	1
the	1
handle	1
rather	1
roughly;	1
when,	1
starting	1
off	1
the	1
coach	1
seat,	1
she	1
cried,	1
"Oh,	1
sir!	1
father!	1
sir!	1
you	1
will	1
spoil	1
it	1
indeed!"	1
said	1
she,	1
with	1
increased	1
vehemence,	1
when,	1
after	1
drawing	1
aside	1
the	1
veil	1
of	1
silver	1
paper,	1
she	1
saw	1
him	1
grasp	1
the	1
myrtle	1
wreathed	1
handle.	1
"Indeed,	1
sir,	1
you	1
will	1
spoil	1
the	1
poor	1
handle."	1
"But	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
THE	1
POOR	1
HANDLE,"	1
said	1
her	1
father,	1
"if	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
to	1
take	1
hold	1
of	1
it?	1
And	1
pray,"	1
continued	1
he,	1
turning	1
the	1
basket	1
round	1
with	1
his	1
finger	1
and	1
thumb,	1
rather	1
in	1
a	1
disrespectful	1
manner,	1
"pray,	1
is	1
this	1
the	1
thing	1
you	1
have	1
been	1
about	1
all	1
this	1
week?	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
you	1
all	1
this	1
week	1
dabbling	1
with	1
paste	1
and	1
rags;	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
conceive	1
what	1
you	1
were	1
about.	1
Is	1
this	1
the	1
thing?"	1
"Yes,	1
sir.	1
You	1
think,	1
then,	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
wasted	1
my	1
time,	1
because	1
the	1
basket	1
is	1
of	1
no	1
use;	1
but	1
then	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
present	1
for	1
my	1
Cousin	1
Bell."	1
"Your	1
Cousin	1
Bell	1
will	1
be	1
very	1
much	1
obliged	1
to	1
you	1
for	1
a	1
present	1
that	1
is	1
of	1
no	1
use.	1
You	1
had	1
better	1
have	1
given	1
her	1
the	1
purple	1
jar."	1
"Oh,	1
father!	1
I	1
thought	1
you	1
had	1
forgotten	1
that--it	1
was	1
two	1
years	1
ago;	1
I'm	1
not	1
so	1
silly	1
now.	1
But	1
Bell	1
will	1
like	1
the	1
basket,	1
I	1
know,	1
though	1
it	1
is	1
of	1
no	1
use."	1
"Then	1
you	1
think	1
Bell	1
is	1
sillier	1
now	1
than	1
you	1
were	1
two	1
years	1
ago,--well,	1
perhaps	1
that	1
is	1
true;	1
but	1
how	1
comes	1
it,	1
Rosamond,	1
now	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
so	1
wise,	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
fond	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
silly	1
person?"	1
"_I_,	1
father?"	1
said	1
Rosamond,	1
hesitating,	1
"I	1
don't	1
think	1
I	1
am	1
VERY	1
fond	1
of	1
her."	1
"I	1
did	1
not	1
say	1
VERY	1
fond."	1
"Well,	1
but	1
I	1
don't	1
think	1
I	1
am	1
at	1
all	1
fond	1
of	1
her."	1
"But	1
you	1
have	1
spent	1
a	1
whole	1
week	1
in	1
making	1
this	1
thing	1
for	1
her."	1
"Yes,	1
and	1
all	1
my	1
half	1
guinea	1
besides."	1
"Yet	1
you	1
think	1
her	1
silly,	1
and	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
fond	1
of	1
her	1
at	1
all;	1
and	1
you	1
say	1
you	1
know	1
this	1
thing	1
will	1
be	1
of	1
no	1
use	1
to	1
her."	1
"But	1
it	1
is	1
her	1
birthday,	1
sir;	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
she	1
will	1
EXPECT	1
something,	1
and	1
everybody	1
else	1
will	1
give	1
her	1
something."	1
"Then	1
your	1
reason	1
for	1
giving	1
is	1
because	1
she	1
expects	1
you	1
to	1
give	1
her	1
something.	1
And	1
will	1
you,	1
or	1
can	1
you,	1
or	1
should	1
you,	1
always	1
give,	1
merely	1
because	1
others	1
EXPECT,	1
or	1
because	1
somebody	1
else	1
gives?"	1
"Always?--no,	1
not	1
always."	1
"Oh,	1
only	1
on	1
birthdays."	1
Rosamond,	1
laughing:	1
"Now	1
you	1
are	1
making	1
a	1
joke	1
of	1
me,	1
papa,	1
I	1
see;	1
but	1
I	1
thought	1
you	1
liked	1
that	1
people	1
should	1
be	1
generous,--my	1
godmother	1
said	1
that	1
she	1
did."	1
"So	1
do	1
I,	1
full	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
your	1
godmother;	1
but	1
we	1
have	1
not	1
yet	1
quite	1
settled	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
generous."	1
"Why	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
generous	1
to	1
make	1
presents?"	1
said	1
Rosamond.	1
"That	1
is	1
the	1
question	1
which	1
it	1
would	1
take	1
up	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
time	1
to	1
answer.	1
But,	1
for	1
instance,	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
present	1
of	1
a	1
thing	1
that	1
you	1
know	1
can	1
be	1
of	1
no	1
use	1
to	1
a	1
person	1
you	1
neither	1
love	1
nor	1
esteem,	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
her	1
birthday,	1
and	1
because	1
everybody	1
gives	1
her	1
something,	1
and	1
because	1
she	1
expects	1
something,	1
and	1
because	1
your	1
godmother	1
says	1
she	1
likes	1
that	1
people	1
should	1
be	1
generous,	1
seems	1
to	1
me,	1
my	1
dear	1
Rosamond,	1
to	1
be,	1
since	1
I	1
must	1
say	1
it,	1
rather	1
more	1
like	1
folly	1
than	1
generosity."	1
Rosamond	1
looked	1
down	1
upon	1
the	1
basket,	1
and	1
was	1
silent.	1
"Then	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
fool,	1
am	1
I?"	1
said	1
she	1
looking	1
up	1
at	1
last.	1
"Because	1
you	1
have	1
made	1
ONE	1
mistake?	1
No.	1
If	1
you	1
have	1
sense	1
enough	1
to	1
see	1
your	1
own	1
mistakes,	1
and	1
can	1
afterwards	1
avoid	1
them,	1
you	1
will	1
never	1
be	1
a	1
fool."	1
Here	1
the	1
carriage	1
stopped,	1
and	1
Rosamond	1
recollected	1
that	1
the	1
basket	1
was	1
uncovered.	1
Now	1
we	1
must	1
observe,	1
that	1
Rosamond's	1
father	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
too	1
severe	1
upon	1
Bell	1
when	1
he	1
called	1
her	1
a	1
silly	1
girl.	1
From	1
her	1
infancy	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
humoured;	1
and	1
at	1
eight	1
years	1
old	1
she	1
had	1
the	1
misfortune	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
spoiled	1
child.	1
She	1
was	1
idle,	1
fretful,	1
and	1
selfish;	1
so	1
that	1
nothing	1
could	1
make	1
her	1
happy.	1
On	1
her	1
birthday	1
she	1
expected,	1
however,	1
to	1
be	1
perfectly	1
happy.	1
Everybody	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
tried	1
to	1
please	1
her,	1
and	1
they	1
succeeded	1
so	1
well,	1
that	1
between	1
breakfast	1
and	1
dinner	1
she	1
had	1
only	1
six	1
fits	1
of	1
crying.	1
The	1
cause	1
of	1
five	1
of	1
these	1
fits	1
no	1
one	1
could	1
discover:	1
but	1
the	1
last,	1
and	1
most	1
lamentable,	1
was	1
occasioned	1
by	1
a	1
disappointment	1
about	1
a	1
worked	1
muslin	1
frock;	1
and	1
accordingly,	1
at	1
dressing	1
time,	1
her	1
maid	1
brought	1
it	1
to	1
her,	1
exclaiming,	1
"See	1
here,	1
miss,	1
what	1
your	1
mamma	1
has	1
sent	1
you	1
on	1
your	1
birthday.	1
Here's	1
a	1
frock	1
fit	1
for	1
a	1
queen--if	1
it	1
had	1
but	1
lace	1
round	1
the	1
cuffs."	1
"And	1
why	1
has	1
not	1
it	1
lace	1
around	1
the	1
cuffs?	1
mamma	1
said	1
it	1
should."	1
"Yes,	1
but	1
mistress	1
was	1
disappointed	1
about	1
the	1
lace;	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
come	1
home."	1
"Not	1
come	1
home,	1
indeed!	1
and	1
didn't	1
they	1
know	1
it	1
was	1
my	1
birthday?	1
But	1
then	1
I	1
say	1
I	1
won't	1
wear	1
it	1
without	1
the	1
lace--I	1
can't	1
wear	1
it	1
without	1
the	1
lace,	1
and	1
I	1
won't."	1
The	1
lace,	1
however,	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
had;	1
and	1
Bell	1
at	1
length	1
submitted	1
to	1
let	1
the	1
frock	1
be	1
put	1
on.	1
"Come,	1
Miss	1
Bell,	1
dry	1
your	1
eyes,"	1
said	1
the	1
maid	1
who	1
educated	1
her;	1
"dry	1
your	1
eyes,	1
and	1
I'll	1
tell	1
you	1
something	1
that	1
will	1
please	1
you."	1
"What,	1
then?"	1
said	1
the	1
child,	1
pouting	1
and	1
sobbing.	1
"Why--but	1
you	1
must	1
not	1
tell	1
that	1
I	1
told	1
you."	1
"No,--but	1
if	1
I	1
am	1
asked?"	1
"Why,	1
if	1
you	1
are	1
asked,	1
you	1
must	1
tell	1
the	1
truth,	1
to	1
be	1
sure.	1
So	1
I'll	1
hold	1
my	1
tongue,	1
miss."	1
"Nay,	1
tell	1
me,	1
though,	1
and	1
I'll	1
never	1
tell--if	1
I	1
AM	1
asked."	1
"Well,	1
then,"	1
said	1
the	1
maid,	1
"your	1
cousin	1
Rosamond	1
is	1
come,	1
and	1
has	1
brought	1
you	1
the	1
most	1
BEAUTIFULLEST	1
thing	1
you	1
ever	1
saw	1
in	1
your	1
life;	1
but	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
to	1
know	1
anything	1
about	1
it	1
till	1
after	1
dinner,	1
because	1
she	1
wants	1
to	1
surprise	1
you;	1
and	1
mistress	1
has	1
put	1
it	1
into	1
her	1
wardrobe	1
till	1
after	1
dinner."	1
"Till	1
after	1
dinner!"	1
repeated	1
Bell,	1
impatiently;	1
"I	1
can't	1
wait	1
till	1
then;	1
I	1
must	1
see	1
it	1
this	1
minute."	1
The	1
maid	1
refused	1
her	1
several	1
times,	1
till	1
Bell	1
burst	1
into	1
another	1
fit	1
of	1
crying,	1
and	1
the	1
maid,	1
fearing	1
that	1
her	1
mistress	1
would	1
be	1
angry	1
with	1
HER,	1
if	1
Bell's	1
eyes	1
were	1
red	1
at	1
dinner	1
time,	1
consented	1
to	1
show	1
her	1
the	1
basket.	1
"How	1
pretty!--but	1
let	1
me	1
have	1
it	1
in	1
my	1
own	1
hands,"	1
said	1
Bell,	1
as	1
the	1
maid	1
held	1
the	1
basket	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
reach.	1
"Oh,	1
no,	1
you	1
must	1
not	1
touch	1
it;	1
for	1
if	1
you	1
should	1
spoil	1
it,	1
what	1
would	1
become	1
of	1
me?"	1
"Become	1
of	1
you,	1
indeed!"	1
exclaimed	1
the	1
spoiled	1
child,	1
who	1
never	1
considered	1
anything	1
but	1
her	1
own	1
immediate	1
gratification--"Become	1
of	1
YOU,	1
indeed!	1
what	1
signifies	1
that--I	1
sha'n't	1
spoil	1
it;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
have	1
it	1
in	1
my	1
own	1
hands.	1
If	1
you	1
don't	1
hold	1
it	1
down	1
for	1
me	1
directly,	1
I'll	1
tell	1
that	1
you	1
showed	1
it	1
to	1
me."	1
"Then	1
you	1
won't	1
snatch	1
it?"	1
"No,	1
no,	1
I	1
won't	1
indeed,"	1
said	1
Bell;	1
but	1
she	1
had	1
learned	1
from	1
her	1
maid	1
a	1
total	1
disregard	1
of	1
truth.	1
She	1
snatched	1
the	1
basket	1
the	1
moment	1
it	1
was	1
within	1
her	1
reach.	1
A	1
struggle	1
ensued,	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
handle	1
and	1
lid	1
were	1
torn	1
off,	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
medallions	1
crushed	1
inwards,	1
before	1
the	1
little	1
fury	1
returned	1
to	1
her	1
senses.	1
Calmed	1
at	1
this	1
sight,	1
the	1
next	1
question	1
was,	1
how	1
she	1
should	1
conceal	1
the	1
mischief	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
done.	1
After	1
many	1
attempts,	1
the	1
handle	1
and	1
lid	1
were	1
replaced;	1
the	1
basket	1
was	1
put	1
exactly	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
spot	1
in	1
which	1
it	1
had	1
stood	1
before,	1
and	1
the	1
maid	1
charged	1
the	1
child,	1
"TO	1
LOOK	1
AS	1
IF	1
NOTHING	1
WAS	1
THE	1
MATTER."	1
We	1
hope	1
that	1
both	1
children	1
and	1
parents	1
will	1
here	1
pause	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
to	1
reflect.	1
The	1
habits	1
of	1
tyranny,	1
meanness,	1
and	1
falsehood,	1
which	1
children	1
acquire	1
from	1
living	1
with	1
bad	1
servants,	1
are	1
scarcely	1
ever	1
conquered	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
course	1
of	1
their	1
future	1
lives.	1
After	1
shutting	1
up	1
the	1
basket	1
they	1
left	1
the	1
room,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
adjoining	1
passage	1
they	1
found	1
a	1
poor	1
girl	1
waiting	1
with	1
a	1
small	1
parcel	1
in	1
her	1
hand.	1
"What's	1
your	1
business?"	1
said	1
the	1
maid.	1
"I	1
have	1
brought	1
home	1
the	1
lace,	1
madam,	1
that	1
was	1
bespoke	1
for	1
the	1
young	1
lady."	1
"Oh,	1
you	1
have,	1
have	1
you,	1
at	1
last?"	1
said	1
Bell;	1
"and	1
pray	1
why	1
didn't	1
you	1
bring	1
it	1
sooner?"	1
The	1
girl	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
answer,	1
but	1
the	1
maid	1
interrupted	1
her,	1
saying--"Come,	1
come,	1
none	1
of	1
your	1
excuses;	1
you	1
are	1
a	1
little	1
idle,	1
good-for-nothing	1
thing,	1
to	1
disappoint	1
Miss	1
Bell	1
upon	1
her	1
birthday.	1
But	1
now	1
you	1
have	1
brought	1
it,	1
let	1
us	1
look	1
at	1
it!"	1
The	1
little	1
girl	1
gave	1
the	1
lace	1
without	1
reply,	1
and	1
the	1
maid	1
desired	1
her	1
to	1
go	1
about	1
her	1
business,	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
expect	1
to	1
be	1
paid;	1
for	1
that	1
her	1
mistress	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
anybody,	1
BECAUSE	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
room	1
full	1
of	1
company.	1
"May	1
I	1
call	1
again,	1
madam,	1
this	1
afternoon?"	1
said	1
the	1
child,	1
timidly.	1
"Lord	1
bless	1
my	1
stars!"	1
replied	1
the	1
maid,	1
"what	1
makes	1
people	1
so	1
poor,	1
I	1
WONDERS!	1
I	1
wish	1
mistress	1
would	1
buy	1
her	1
lace	1
at	1
the	1
warehouse,	1
as	1
I	1
told	1
her,	1
and	1
not	1
of	1
these	1
folks.	1
Call	1
again!	1
yes,	1
to	1
be	1
sure.	1
I	1
believe	1
you'd	1
call,	1
call,	1
call	1
twenty	1
times	1
for	1
twopence."	1
However	1
ungraciously	1
the	1
permission	1
to	1
call	1
again	1
was	1
granted,	1
it	1
was	1
received	1
with	1
gratitude.	1
The	1
little	1
girl	1
departed	1
with	1
a	1
cheerful	1
countenance;	1
and	1
Bell	1
teazed	1
her	1
maid	1
till	1
she	1
got	1
her	1
to	1
sew	1
the	1
long	1
wished-for	1
lace	1
upon	1
her	1
cuffs.	1
Unfortunate	1
Bell!--All	1
dinner	1
time	1
passed,	1
and	1
people	1
were	1
so	1
hungry,	1
so	1
busy,	1
or	1
so	1
stupid,	1
that	1
not	1
an	1
eye	1
observed	1
her	1
favourite	1
piece	1
of	1
finery.	1
Till	1
at	1
length	1
she	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
able	1
to	1
conceal	1
her	1
impatience,	1
and	1
turning	1
to	1
Laura,	1
who	1
sat	1
next	1
to	1
her,	1
she	1
said,	1
"You	1
have	1
no	1
lace	1
upon	1
your	1
cuffs.	1
Look	1
how	1
beautiful	1
mine	1
is!--is	1
not	1
it?	1
Don't	1
you	1
wish	1
your	1
mamma	1
could	1
afford	1
to	1
give	1
some	1
like	1
it?	1
But	1
you	1
can't	1
get	1
any	1
if	1
she	1
would,	1
for	1
this	1
was	1
made	1
on	1
purpose	1
for	1
me	1
on	1
my	1
birthday,	1
and	1
nobody	1
can	1
get	1
a	1
bit	1
more	1
anywhere,	1
if	1
they	1
would	1
give	1
the	1
world	1
for	1
it."	1
"But	1
cannot	1
the	1
person	1
who	1
made	1
it,"	1
said	1
Laura,	1
"make	1
any	1
more	1
like	1
it?"	1
"No,	1
no,	1
no!"	1
cried	1
Bell;	1
for	1
she	1
had	1
already	1
learned,	1
either	1
from	1
her	1
maid	1
or	1
her	1
mother,	1
the	1
mean	1
pride	1
which	1
values	1
things	1
not	1
for	1
being	1
really	1
pretty	1
or	1
useful,	1
but	1
for	1
being	1
such	1
as	1
nobody	1
else	1
can	1
procure.	1
"Nobody	1
can	1
get	1
any	1
like	1
it,	1
I	1
say,"	1
repeated	1
Bell;	1
"nobody	1
in	1
all	1
London	1
can	1
make	1
it	1
but	1
one	1
person,	1
and	1
that	1
person	1
will	1
never	1
make	1
a	1
bit	1
for	1
anybody	1
but	1
me,	1
I	1
am	1
sure.	1
Mamma	1
won't	1
let	1
her,	1
if	1
I	1
ask	1
her	1
not."	1
"Very	1
well,"	1
said	1
Laura,	1
coolly,	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
want	1
any	1
of	1
it;	1
you	1
need	1
not	1
be	1
so	1
violent:	1
I	1
assure	1
you	1
that	1
I	1
don't	1
want	1
any	1
of	1
it."	1
"Yes,	1
but	1
you	1
do,	1
though,"	1
said	1
Bell,	1
more	1
angrily.	1
"No,	1
indeed,"	1
said	1
Laura,	1
smiling.	1
"You	1
do,	1
in	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
your	1
heart;	1
but	1
you	1
say	1
you	1
don't	1
to	1
plague	1
me,	1
I	1
know,"	1
cried	1
Bell,	1
swelling	1
with	1
disappointed	1
vanity.	1
"It	1
is	1
pretty	1
for	1
all	1
that,	1
and	1
it	1
cost	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
money	1
too,	1
and	1
nobody	1
shall	1
have	1
any	1
like	1
it,	1
if	1
they	1
cried	1
their	1
eyes	1
out."	1
Laura	1
received	1
this	1
declaration	1
in	1
silence--Rosamond	1
smiled;	1
and	1
at	1
her	1
smile	1
the	1
ill-suppressed	1
rage	1
of	1
the	1
spoiled	1
child	1
burst	1
forth	1
into	1
the	1
seventh	1
and	1
loudest	1
fit	1
of	1
crying	1
which	1
had	1
yet	1
been	1
heard	1
on	1
her	1
birthday.	1
"What's	1
the	1
matter,	1
my	1
pet?"	1
cried	1
her	1
mother;	1
"come	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
tell	1
me	1
what's	1
the	1
matter."	1
Bell	1
ran	1
roaring	1
to	1
her	1
mother;	1
but	1
no	1
otherwise	1
explained	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
her	1
sorrow	1
than	1
by	1
tearing	1
the	1
fine	1
lace	1
with	1
frantic	1
gestures	1
from	1
her	1
cuffs,	1
and	1
throwing	1
the	1
fragments	1
into	1
her	1
mother's	1
lap.	1
"Oh!	1
the	1
lace,	1
child!--are	1
you	1
mad?"	1
said	1
her	1
mother,	1
catching	1
hold	1
of	1
both	1
her	1
hands.	1
"Your	1
beautiful	1
lace,	1
my	1
dear	1
love--do	1
you	1
know	1
how	1
much	1
it	1
cost?"	1
"I	1
don't	1
care	1
how	1
much	1
it	1
cost--it	1
is	1
not	1
beautiful,	1
and	1
I'll	1
have	1
none	1
of	1
it,"	1
replied	1
Bell,	1
sobbing;	1
"for	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
beautiful."	1
"But	1
it	1
is	1
beautiful,"	1
retorted	1
her	1
mother;	1
"I	1
chose	1
the	1
pattern	1
myself.	1
Who	1
has	1
put	1
it	1
into	1
your	1
head,	1
child,	1
to	1
dislike	1
it?	1
Was	1
it	1
Nancy?"	1
"No,	1
not	1
Nancy,	1
but	1
THEM,	1
mamma,"	1
said	1
Bell,	1
pointing	1
to	1
Laura	1
and	1
Rosamond.	1
"Oh,	1
fie!	1
don't	1
POINT,"	1
said	1
her	1
mother,	1
putting	1
down	1
her	1
stubborn	1
finger;	1
"nor	1
say	1
THEM,	1
like	1
Nancy;	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
you	1
misunderstood.	1
Miss	1
Laura,	1
I	1
am	1
sure,	1
did	1
not	1
mean	1
any	1
such	1
thing."	1
"No,	1
madam;	1
and	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
say	1
any	1
such	1
thing,	1
that	1
I	1
recollect,"	1
said	1
Laura,	1
gently.	1
"Oh,	1
no,	1
indeed!"	1
cried	1
Rosamond,	1
warmly,	1
rising	1
in	1
her	1
sister's	1
defence.	1
No	1
defence	1
or	1
explanation,	1
however,	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
heard,	1
for	1
everybody	1
had	1
now	1
gathered	1
round	1
Bell,	1
to	1
dry	1
her	1
tears,	1
and	1
to	1
comfort	1
her	1
for	1
the	1
mischief	1
she	1
had	1
done	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
cuffs.	1
They	1
succeeded	1
so	1
well,	1
that	1
in	1
about	1
a	1
quarter	1
of	1
an	1
hour	1
the	1
young	1
lady's	1
eyes,	1
and	1
the	1
reddened	1
arches	1
over	1
her	1
eyebrows	1
came	1
to	1
their	1
natural	1
colour;	1
and	1
the	1
business	1
being	1
thus	1
happily	1
hushed	1
up,	1
the	1
mother,	1
as	1
a	1
reward	1
to	1
her	1
daughter	1
for	1
her	1
good	1
humour,	1
begged	1
that	1
Rosamond	1
would	1
now	1
be	1
so	1
good	1
as	1
to	1
produce	1
her	1
"charming	1
present."	1
Rosamond,	1
followed	1
by	1
all	1
the	1
company,	1
amongst	1
whom,	1
to	1
her	1
great	1
joy,	1
was	1
her	1
godmother,	1
proceeded	1
to	1
the	1
dressing	1
room.	1
"Now	1
I	1
am	1
sure,"	1
thought	1
she,	1
"Bell	1
will	1
be	1
surprised,	1
and	1
my	1
godmother	1
will	1
see	1
she	1
was	1
right	1
about	1
my	1
generosity."	1
The	1
doors	1
of	1
the	1
wardrobe	1
were	1
opened	1
with	1
due	1
ceremony,	1
and	1
the	1
filigree	1
basket	1
appeared	1
in	1
all	1
its	1
glory.	1
"Well,	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
charming	1
present,	1
indeed!"	1
said	1
the	1
godmother,	1
who	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
company;	1
"MY	1
Rosamond	1
knows	1
how	1
to	1
make	1
presents."	1
And	1
as	1
she	1
spoke,	1
she	1
took	1
hold	1
of	1
the	1
basket,	1
to	1
lift	1
it	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
admiring	1
audience.	1
Scarcely	1
had	1
she	1
touched	1
it,	1
when,	1
lo!	1
the	1
basket	1
fell	1
to	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
only	1
the	1
handle	1
remained	1
in	1
her	1
hand.	1
All	1
eyes	1
were	1
fixed	1
upon	1
the	1
wreck.	1
Exclamations	1
of	1
sorrow	1
were	1
heard	1
in	1
various	1
tones;	1
and	1
"Who	1
can	1
have	1
done	1
this?"	1
was	1
all	1
that	1
Rosamond	1
could	1
say.	1
Bell	1
stood	1
in	1
sullen	1
silence,	1
which	1
she	1
obstinately	1
preserved	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
inquiries	1
that	1
were	1
made	1
about	1
the	1
disaster.	1
At	1
length	1
the	1
servants	1
were	1
summoned,	1
and	1
amongst	1
them,	1
Nancy,	1
Miss	1
Bell's	1
maid	1
and	1
governess.	1
She	1
affected	1
much	1
surprise	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
what	1
had	1
befallen	1
the	1
basket,	1
and	1
declared	1
that	1
she	1
knew	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
matter,	1
but	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
seen	1
her	1
mistress	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
put	1
it	1
quite	1
safe	1
into	1
the	1
wardrobe;	1
and	1
that,	1
for	1
her	1
part,	1
she	1
had	1
never	1
touched	1
it,	1
or	1
thought	1
of	1
touching	1
it,	1
in	1
her	1
born	1
days.	1
"Nor	1
Miss	1
Bell,	1
neither,	1
ma'am,--I	1
can	1
answer	1
for	1
her;	1
for	1
she	1
never	1
knew	1
of	1
its	1
being	1
there,	1
because	1
I	1
never	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
mentioned	1
it	1
to	1
her,	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
such	1
a	1
thing	1
in	1
the	1
house,	1
because	1
I	1
knew	1
Miss	1
Rosamond	1
wanted	1
to	1
surprise	1
her	1
with	1
the	1
secret;	1
so	1
I	1
never	1
mentioned	1
a	1
sentence	1
of	1
it--did	1
I,	1
Miss	1
Bell?"	1
Bell,	1
putting	1
on	1
the	1
deceitful	1
look	1
which	1
her	1
maid	1
had	1
taught	1
her,	1
answered	1
boldly,	1
"NO;"	1
but	1
she	1
had	1
hold	1
of	1
Rosamond's	1
hand,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
instant	1
she	1
uttered	1
this	1
falsehood	1
she	1
squeezed	1
it	1
terribly.	1
"Why	1
do	1
you	1
squeeze	1
my	1
hand	1
so?"	1
said	1
Rosamond,	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice;	1
"what	1
are	1
you	1
afraid	1
of?"	1
"Afraid	1
of!"	1
cried	1
Bell,	1
turning	1
angrily;	1
"I'm	1
not	1
afraid	1
of	1
anything,--	1
I've	1
nothing	1
to	1
be	1
afraid	1
about."	1
"Nay,	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
say	1
you	1
had,"	1
whispered	1
Rosamond;	1
"but	1
only	1
if	1
you	1
did	1
by	1
accident--you	1
know	1
what	1
I	1
mean--I	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
angry	1
if	1
you	1
did--only	1
say	1
so."	1
"I	1
say	1
I	1
did	1
not!"	1
cried	1
Bell,	1
furiously;	1
"Mamma,	1
mamma!	1
Nancy!	1
my	1
cousin	1
Rosamond	1
won't	1
believe	1
me!	1
That's	1
very	1
hard.	1
It's	1
very	1
rude,	1
and	1
I	1
won't	1
bear	1
it--I	1
won't."	1
"Don't	1
be	1
angry,	1
love.	1
Don't,"	1
said	1
the	1
maid.	1
"Nobody	1
suspects	1
you,	1
darling,"	1
said	1
her	1
mother;	1
"but	1
she	1
has	1
too	1
much	1
sensibility.	1
Don't	1
cry,	1
love;	1
nobody	1
suspected	1
you.	1
But	1
you	1
know,"	1
continued	1
she,	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
maid,	1
"somebody	1
must	1
have	1
done	1
this,	1
and	1
I	1
must	1
know	1
how	1
it	1
was	1
done.	1
Miss	1
Rosamond's	1
charming	1
present	1
must	1
not	1
be	1
spoiled	1
in	1
this	1
way,	1
in	1
my	1
house,	1
without	1
my	1
taking	1
proper	1
notice	1
of	1
it.	1
I	1
assure	1
you	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
angry	1
about	1
it,	1
Rosamond."	1
Rosamond	1
did	1
not	1
rejoice	1
in	1
her	1
anger,	1
and	1
had	1
nearly	1
made	1
a	1
sad	1
mistake	1
by	1
speaking	1
aloud	1
her	1
thoughts--"I	1
WAS	1
VERY	1
FOOLISH--"	1
she	1
began	1
and	1
stopped.	1
"Ma'am,"	1
cried	1
the	1
maid,	1
suddenly,	1
"I'll	1
venture	1
to	1
say	1
I	1
know	1
who	1
did	1
it."	1
"Who?"	1
said	1
everyone,	1
eagerly.	1
"Who?"	1
said	1
Bell,	1
trembling."	1
"Why,	1
miss,	1
don't	1
you	1
recollect	1
that	1
little	1
girl	1
with	1
the	1
lace,	1
that	1
we	1
saw	1
peeping	1
about	1
in	1
the	1
passage?	1
I'm	1
sure	1
she	1
must	1
have	1
done	1
it;	1
for	1
here	1
she	1
was	1
by	1
herself	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
or	1
more,	1
and	1
not	1
another	1
creature	1
has	1
been	1
in	1
mistress'	1
dressing-room,	1
to	1
my	1
certain	1
knowledge,	1
since	1
morning.	1
Those	1
sort	1
of	1
people	1
have	1
so	1
much	1
curiosity.	1
I'm	1
sure	1
she	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
meddling	1
with	1
it,"	1
added	1
the	1
maid.	1
"Oh,	1
yes,	1
that's	1
the	1
thing,"	1
said	1
the	1
mistress,	1
decidedly.	1
"Well,	1
Miss	1
Rosamond,	1
for	1
your	1
comfort	1
she	1
shall	1
never	1
come	1
into	1
my	1
house	1
again."	1
"Oh,	1
that	1
would	1
not	1
comfort	1
me	1
at	1
all,"	1
said	1
Rosamond;	1
"besides,	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
sure	1
that	1
she	1
did	1
it,	1
and	1
if--"	1
A	1
single	1
knock	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
was	1
heard	1
at	1
this	1
instant.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
little	1
girl,	1
who	1
came	1
to	1
be	1
paid	1
for	1
her	1
lace.	1
"Call	1
her	1
in,"	1
said	1
the	1
lady	1
of	1
the	1
house;	1
"let	1
us	1
see	1
her	1
directly."	1
The	1
maid,	1
who	1
was	1
afraid	1
that	1
the	1
girl's	1
innocence	1
would	1
appear	1
if	1
she	1
were	1
produced,	1
hesitated;	1
but	1
upon	1
her	1
mistress	1
repeating	1
her	1
commands,	1
she	1
was	1
forced	1
to	1
obey.	1
The	1
girl	1
came	1
in	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
simplicity;	1
but	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
a	1
room	1
full	1
of	1
company	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
abashed.	1
Rosamond	1
and	1
Laura	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
and	1
one	1
another	1
with	1
surprise,	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
same	1
little	1
girl	1
whom	1
they	1
had	1
seen	1
weaving	1
lace.	1
"Is	1
not	1
it	1
she?"	1
whispered	1
Rosamond	1
to	1
her	1
sister.	1
"Yes,	1
it	1
is;	1
but	1
hush,"	1
said	1
Laura,	1
"she	1
does	1
not	1
know	1
us.	1
Don't	1
say	1
a	1
word,	1
let	1
us	1
hear	1
what	1
she	1
will	1
say."	1
Laura	1
got	1
behind	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
company	1
as	1
she	1
spoke,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
little	1
girl	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
her.	1
"Vastly	1
well!"	1
said	1
Bell's	1
mother;	1
"I	1
am	1
waiting	1
to	1
see	1
how	1
long	1
you	1
will	1
have	1
the	1
assurance	1
to	1
stand	1
there	1
with	1
that	1
innocent	1
look.	1
Did	1
you	1
ever	1
see	1
that	1
basket	1
before?"	1
"Yes,	1
ma'am,"	1
said	1
the	1
girl.	1
"YES,	1
MA'AM!"	1
cried	1
the	1
maid;	1
"and	1
what	1
else	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
about	1
it?	1
You	1
had	1
better	1
confess	1
it	1
at	1
once,	1
and	1
mistress,	1
perhaps,	1
will	1
say	1
no	1
more	1
about	1
it."	1
"Yes,	1
do	1
confess	1
it,"	1
added	1
Bell,	1
earnestly.	1
"Confess	1
what,	1
madam?"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
girl;	1
"I	1
never	1
touched	1
the	1
basket,	1
madam."	1
"You	1
never	1
TOUCHED	1
it;	1
but	1
you	1
confess,"	1
interrupted	1
Bell's	1
mother,	1
"that	1
you	1
DID	1
SEE	1
it	1
before.	1
And,	1
pray,	1
how	1
came	1
you	1
to	1
see	1
it?	1
You	1
must	1
have	1
opened	1
my	1
wardrobe."	1
"No,	1
indeed,	1
ma'am,"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
girl;	1
"but	1
I	1
was	1
waiting	1
in	1
the	1
passage,	1
ma'am,	1
and	1
this	1
door	1
was	1
partly	1
open;	1
and	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
maid,	1
you	1
know,	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
seeing	1
it."	1
"Why,	1
how	1
could	1
you	1
see	1
through	1
the	1
doors	1
of	1
my	1
wardrobe?"	1
rejoined	1
the	1
lady.	1
The	1
maid,	1
frightened,	1
pulled	1
the	1
little	1
girl	1
by	1
the	1
sleeve.	1
"Answer	1
me,"	1
said	1
the	1
lady,	1
"where	1
did	1
you	1
see	1
this	1
basket?"	1
Another	1
stronger	1
pull.	1
"I	1
saw	1
it,	1
madam,	1
in	1
her	1
hands,"	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
maid;	1
"and--"	1
"Well,	1
and	1
what	1
became	1
of	1
it	1
afterwards?"	1
"Ma'am"--hesitating--"miss	1
pulled,	1
and	1
by	1
accident--I	1
believe,	1
I	1
saw,	1
ma'am--miss,	1
you	1
know	1
what	1
I	1
saw."	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
know--I	1
do	1
not	1
know;	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
did,	1
you	1
had	1
no	1
business	1
there;	1
and	1
mamma	1
won't	1
believe	1
you,	1
I	1
am	1
sure."	1
Everybody	1
else,	1
however,	1
did	1
believe;	1
and	1
their	1
eyes	1
were	1
fixed	1
upon	1
Bell	1
in	1
a	1
manner	1
which	1
made	1
her	1
feel	1
rather	1
ashamed.	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
all	1
look	1
at	1
me	1
so	1
for?	1
Why	1
do	1
you	1
all	1
look	1
so?	1
And	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
shame	1
on	1
my	1
birthday?"	1
cried	1
she,	1
bursting	1
into	1
a	1
roar	1
of	1
passion;	1
"and	1
all	1
for	1
this	1
nasty	1
thing!"	1
added	1
she,	1
pushing	1
away	1
the	1
remains	1
of	1
the	1
basket,	1
and	1
looking	1
angrily	1
at	1
Rosamond.	1
"Bell!	1
Bell!	1
O,	1
fie!	1
fie!--Now	1
I	1
am	1
ashamed	1
of	1
you;	1
that's	1
quite	1
rude	1
to	1
your	1
cousin,"	1
said	1
her	1
mother,	1
who	1
was	1
more	1
shocked	1
at	1
her	1
daughter's	1
want	1
of	1
politeness	1
than	1
at	1
her	1
falsehood.	1
"Take	1
her	1
away,	1
Nancy,	1
till	1
she	1
has	1
done	1
crying,"	1
added	1
she	1
to	1
the	1
maid,	1
who	1
accordingly	1
carried	1
off	1
her	1
pupil.	1
Rosamond,	1
during	1
this	1
scene,	1
especially	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
when	1
her	1
present	1
was	1
pushed	1
away	1
with	1
such	1
disdain,	1
had	1
been	1
making	1
reflections	1
upon	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
true	1
generosity.	1
A	1
smile	1
from	1
her	1
father,	1
who	1
stood	1
by,	1
a	1
silent	1
spectator	1
of	1
the	1
catastrophe	1
of	1
the	1
filigree	1
basket,	1
gave	1
rise	1
to	1
these	1
reflections;	1
nor	1
were	1
they	1
entirely	1
dissipated	1
by	1
the	1
condolence	1
of	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
company,	1
nor	1
even	1
by	1
the	1
praises	1
of	1
her	1
godmother,	1
who,	1
for	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
condoling	1
with	1
her,	1
said,	1
"Well,	1
my	1
dear	1
Rosamond,	1
I	1
admire	1
your	1
generous	1
spirit.	1
You	1
know	1
I	1
prophesied	1
that	1
your	1
half-guinea	1
would	1
be	1
gone	1
the	1
soonest.	1
Did	1
I	1
not,	1
Laura?"	1
said	1
she,	1
appealing,	1
in	1
a	1
sarcastic	1
tone,	1
to	1
where	1
she	1
thought	1
Laura	1
was.	1
"Where	1
is	1
Laura?	1
I	1
don't	1
see	1
her."	1
Laura	1
came	1
forward.	1
"You	1
are	1
too	1
PRUDENT	1
to	1
throw	1
away	1
your	1
money	1
like	1
your	1
sister.	1
Your	1
half-guinea,	1
I'll	1
answer	1
for	1
it,	1
is	1
snug	1
in	1
your	1
pocket--Is	1
it	1
not?"	1
"No,	1
madam,"	1
answered	1
she,	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice.	1
But	1
low	1
as	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
Laura	1
was,	1
the	1
poor	1
little	1
lace-girl	1
heard	1
it;	1
and	1
now,	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time,	1
fixing	1
her	1
eyes	1
upon	1
Laura,	1
recollected	1
her	1
benefactress.	1
"Oh,	1
that's	1
the	1
young	1
lady!"	1
she	1
exclaimed,	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
of	1
joyful	1
gratitude,	1
"the	1
good,	1
good	1
young	1
lady,	1
who	1
gave	1
me	1
the	1
half-	1
guinea,	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
stay	1
to	1
be	1
thanked	1
for	1
it;	1
but	1
I	1
WILL	1
thank	1
her	1
now."	1
"The	1
half-guinea,	1
Laura!"	1
said	1
her	1
godmother.	1
"What	1
is	1
all	1
this?"	1
"I'll	1
tell	1
you,	1
madam,	1
if	1
you	1
please,"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
girl.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
expectation	1
of	1
being	1
praised	1
for	1
it,	1
that	1
Laura	1
had	1
been	1
generous,	1
and	1
therefore	1
everybody	1
was	1
really	1
touched	1
with	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
the	1
weaving-pillow;	1
and	1
whilst	1
they	1
praised,	1
felt	1
a	1
certain	1
degree	1
of	1
respect,	1
which	1
is	1
not	1
always	1
felt	1
by	1
those	1
who	1
pour	1
forth	1
eulogiums.	1
RESPECT	1
is	1
not	1
an	1
improper	1
word,	1
even	1
applied	1
to	1
a	1
child	1
of	1
Laura's	1
age;	1
for	1
let	1
the	1
age	1
or	1
situation	1
of	1
the	1
person	1
be	1
what	1
it	1
may,	1
they	1
command	1
respect	1
who	1
deserve	1
it.	1
"Ah,	1
madam!"	1
said	1
Rosamond	1
to	1
her	1
godmother,	1
"now	1
you	1
see--you	1
see	1
she	1
is	1
NOT	1
a	1
little	1
miser.	1
I'm	1
sure	1
that's	1
better	1
than	1
wasting	1
half	1
a	1
guinea	1
upon	1
a	1
filigree	1
basket;	1
is	1
it	1
not,	1
ma'am?"	1
said	1
she,	1
with	1
an	1
eagerness	1
which	1
showed	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
forgotten	1
all	1
her	1
own	1
misfortunes	1
in	1
sympathy	1
with	1
her	1
sister.	1
"This	1
is	1
being	1
REALLY	1
GENEROUS,	1
father,	1
is	1
it	1
not?"	1
"Yes,	1
Rosamond,"	1
said	1
her	1
father,	1
and	1
he	1
kissed	1
her;	1
"this	1
IS	1
being	1
really	1
generous.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
only	1
by	1
giving	1
away	1
money	1
that	1
we	1
can	1
show	1
generosity;	1
it	1
is	1
by	1
giving	1
up	1
to	1
others	1
anything	1
that	1
we	1
like	1
ourselves:	1
and	1
therefore,"	1
added	1
he,	1
smiling,	1
"it	1
is	1
really	1
generous	1
of	1
you	1
to	1
give	1
your	1
sister	1
the	1
thing	1
you	1
like	1
best	1
of	1
all	1
others."	1
"The	1
thing	1
I	1
like	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
all	1
others,	1
father,"	1
said	1
Rosamond,	1
half	1
pleased,	1
half	1
vexed.	1
"What	1
is	1
that,	1
I	1
wonder?	1
You	1
don't	1
mean	1
PRAISE,	1
do	1
you,	1
sir?"	1
"Nay,	1
you	1
must	1
decide	1
that	1
yourself,	1
Rosamond."	1
"Why,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
she,	1
ingenuously,	1
"perhaps	1
it	1
WAS	1
ONCE	1
the	1
thing	1
I	1
liked	1
best;	1
but	1
the	1
pleasure	1
I	1
have	1
just	1
felt	1
makes	1
me	1
like	1
something	1
else	1
much	1
better."	1

"Yesterday	1
this	1
triennial	1
ceremony	1
took	1
place,	1
with	1
which	1
the	1
public	1
are	1
too	1
well	1
acquainted	1
to	1
require	1
a	1
particular	1
description.	1
A	1
collection,	1
called	1
Salt,	1
is	1
taken	1
from	1
the	1
public,	1
which	1
forms	1
a	1
purse,	1
to	1
support	1
the	1
Captain	1
of	1
the	1
School	1
in	1
his	1
studies	1
at	1
Cambridge.	1
This	1
collection	1
is	1
made	1
by	1
the	1
Scholars,	1
dressed	1
in	1
fancy	1
dresses,	1
all	1
round	1
the	1
country.	1
"At	1
eleven	1
o'clock,	1
the	1
youths	1
being	1
assembled	1
in	1
their	1
habiliments	1
at	1
the	1
College,	1
the	1
Royal	1
Family	1
set	1
off	1
from	1
the	1
Castle	1
to	1
see	1
them,	1
and,	1
after	1
walking	1
round	1
the	1
Courtyard,	1
they	1
proceeded	1
to	1
Salt	1
Hill	1
in	1
the	1
following	1
order:--	1
"His	1
Majesty,	1
his	1
Royal	1
Highness	1
the	1
Prince	1
of	1
Wales,	1
and	1
the	1
Earl	1
of	1
Uxbridge.	1
"Their	1
Royal	1
Highnesses	1
the	1
Dukes	1
of	1
Kent	1
and	1
Cumberland,	1
Earl	1
Morton,	1
and	1
General	1
Gwynne,	1
all	1
on	1
horseback,	1
dressed	1
in	1
the	1
Windsor	1
uniform,	1
except	1
the	1
Prince	1
of	1
Wales,	1
who	1
wore	1
a	1
suit	1
of	1
dark	1
blue,	1
and	1
a	1
brown	1
surtout	1
over.	1
"Then	1
followed	1
the	1
Scholars,	1
preceded	1
by	1
the	1
Marechal	1

"The	1

was	1
brought	1
up	1
by	1
her	1
Majesty	1
and	1
her	1
amiable	1
daughters	1
in	1
two	1
carriages,	1
and	1
a	1
numerous	1
company	1
of	1
equestrians	1
and	1
pedestrians,	1
all	1
eager	1
to	1
behold	1
their	1
Sovereign	1
and	1
his	1
family.	1
Among	1
the	1
former,	1
Lady	1
Lade	1
was	1
foremost	1
in	1
the	1
throng;	1
only	1
two	1
others	1
dared	1
venture	1
their	1
persons	1
on	1
horseback	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
multitude.	1
"The	1
King	1
and	1
Royal	1
Family	1
were	1
stopped	1
on	1
Eton	1
Bridge	1
by	1
Messrs.	1
Young	1
and	1
Mansfield,	1
the	1
Salt	1
Bearers,	1
to	1
whom	1
their	1
Majesties	1
delivered	1
their	1
customary	1
donation	1
of	1
fifty	1
guineas	1
each.	1
"At	1
Salt	1
Hill,	1
his	1
Majesty,	1
with	1
his	1
usual	1
affability,	1
took	1
upon	1
himself	1
to	1
arrange	1
the	1
procession	1
round	1
the	1
Royal	1
carriages;	1
and	1
even	1
when	1
the	1
horses	1
were	1
taken	1
off,	1
with	1
the	1
assistance	1
of	1
the	1
Duke	1
of	1
Kent,	1
fastened	1
the	1
traces	1
round	1
the	1
pole	1
of	1
the	1
coaches,	1
to	1
prevent	1
any	1
inconvenience.	1
"An	1
exceeding	1
heavy	1
shower	1
of	1
rain	1
coming	1
on,	1
the	1
Prince	1
took	1
leave,	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
'Windmill	1
Inn,'	1
till	1
it	1
subsided.	1
The	1
King	1
and	1
his	1
attendants	1
weathered	1
it	1
out	1
in	1
their	1
great-coats.	1
"After	1
the	1
young	1
gentlemen	1
walked	1
round	1
the	1
carriage,	1
Ensign	1
Vince	1
and	1
the	1
Salt	1
Bearers	1
proceeded	1
to	1
the	1
summit	1
of	1
the	1
hill;	1
but	1
the	1
wind	1
being	1
boisterous,	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
exhibit	1
his	1
dexterity	1
in	1
displaying	1
his	1
flag,	1
and	1
the	1
space	1
being	1
too	1
small	1
before	1
the	1
carriages,	1
from	1
the	1
concourse	1
of	1
spectators,	1
the	1
King	1
kindly	1
acquiesced	1
in	1
not	1
having	1
it	1
displayed	1
under	1
such	1
inconvenience.	1
"Their	1
Majesties	1
and	1
the	1
Princesses	1
then	1
returned	1
home,	1
the	1
King	1
occasionally	1
stopping	1
to	1
converse	1
with	1
the	1
Dean	1

Harrington,	1
and	1
other	1

"The	1

partook	1
of	1
an	1
elegant	1
dinner	1
at	1
the	1
'Windmill	1

and	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
walked	1
on	1
Windsor	1

"Their	1

Duke	1

after	1
taking	1

for	1

and	1
honoured	1

"The	1

the	1

returned	1

and	1
the	1

were	1
all	1
sumptuously	1

About	1
six	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
all	1
the	1

returned	1
in	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
procession,	1
and,	1
marching	1
round	1
the	1
great	1
square	1
of	1
Eton,	1
were	1
dismissed.	1
The	1
captain	1
then	1
paid	1
his	1
respects	1
to	1
the	1
Royal	1
Family,	1
at	1
the	1
Queen's	1
Lodge,	1
Windsor,	1
previously	1
to	1
his	1
departure	1
for	1
King's	1
College,	1
Cambridge,	1
to	1
defray	1
which	1
expense	1
the	1
produce	1
of	1
the	1
Montem	1
was	1
presented	1
to	1
him.	1
"The	1
day	1
concluded	1
by	1
a	1
brilliant	1
promenade	1
of	1
beauty,	1
rank,	1
and	1
fashion,	1
on	1
Windsor	1
Terrace,	1
enlivened	1
by	1
the	1
performance	1
of	1
several	1
bands	1
of	1
music.	1
"The	1
origin	1
of	1
the	1
procession	1
is	1
from	1
the	1
custom	1
by	1
which	1
the	1
Manor	1
was	1
held.	1
"The	1
custom	1
of	1
hunting	1
the	1
Ram	1
belonged	1
to	1
Eton	1
College,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
custom	1
of	1
Salt;	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
discontinued	1
by	1
Dr.	1
Cook,	1
late	1
Dean	1
of	1
Ely.	1
Now	1
this	1
custom	1
we	1
know	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
entered	1
on	1
the	1
register	1
of	1
the	1
Royal	1
Abbey	1
of	1
Bec,	1
in	1
Normandy,	1
as	1
one	1
belonging	1
to	1
the	1
Manor	1
of	1
East	1
or	1
Great	1
Wrotham,	1
in	1
Norfolk,	1
given	1
by	1
Ralph	1
de	1
Toni	1
to	1
the	1
Abbey	1
of	1
Bec,	1
and	1
was	1
as	1
follows:--When	1
the	1
harvest	1
was	1
finished	1
the	1
tenants	1
were	1
to	1
have	1
half	1
an	1
acre	1
of	1
barley,	1
and	1
a	1
ram	1
let	1
loose;	1
and	1
if	1
they	1
caught	1
him	1
he	1
was	1
their	1
own	1
to	1
make	1
merry	1
with;	1
but	1
if	1
he	1
escaped	1
from	1
them	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
Lord's.	1
The	1
Etonians,	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
secure	1
the	1
ram,	1
houghed	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
Irish	1
fashion,	1
and	1
then	1
attacked	1
him	1
with	1
great	1
clubs.	1
The	1
cruelty	1
of	1
this	1
proceeding	1
brought	1
it	1
into	1
disuse,	1
and	1
now	1
it	1
exists	1
no	1
longer.--See	1

Heyday!	1
Why,	1
what	1
a	1
plague	1
would	1
you	1
have	1
me	1
call	1
you?	1
The	1
other	1
day	1
you	1
quarrelled	1
with	1
me	1
for	1
calling	1
you	1
Mrs.	1

Landlady.	1
To	1
be	1
sure	1
I	1
did,	1
and	1
very	1
proper	1
in	1

I	1
should.	1
I've	1
turned	1
off	1
three	1

screaming	1

But	1
'tis	1
all	1
your	1
ill	1
manners.	1
Landlord.	1
Ill	1
manners!	1
Why,	1
if	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
so	1
bold,	1
if	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
Mrs.	1

Oh,	1
as	1
to	1
that,	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
objections	1
nor	1
impediments	1
to	1
your	1
being	1
called	1
LANDLORD.	1
You	1
look	1
it,	1
and	1
become	1
it	1
very	1
proper.	1
Landlord.	1
Why,	1
yes,	1
indeed,	1
thank	1
my	1
tankard,	1
I	1
do	1
look	1
it,	1
and	1
become	1
it,	1
and	1
am	1
nowise	1
ashamed	1
of	1
it;	1
but	1
everyone	1
to	1
their	1
mind,	1
as	1
you,	1
wife,	1
don't	1
fancy	1
the	1
being	1
called	1
Mrs.	1
Landlady.	1
Landlady.	1
To	1
be	1
sure	1
I	1
don't.	1
Why,	1
when	1
folks	1
hear	1
the	1
old	1
fashioned	1
cry	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
Landlady!	1
Mrs.	1
Landlady!	1
who	1
do	1
they	1
expect,	1
think	1
you,	1
to	1
see,	1
but	1
an	1
overgrown,	1
fat,	1
featherbed	1
of	1
a	1
woman,	1
coming	1
waddling	1
along	1
with	1
her	1
thumbs	1
sticking	1
on	1
each	1
side	1
of	1
her	1
apron,	1
o'	1
this	1
fashion?	1
Now,	1
to	1
see	1
me	1
coming,	1
nobody	1
would	1
take	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
landlady.	1
Landlord.	1
Very	1
true,	1
indeed,	1
wife--Mrs.	1
Newington,	1
I	1
mean--I	1
ask	1
pardon;	1
but	1
now	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
with	1
what	1
we	1
were	1
saying	1
about	1
the	1
unpossibility	1
of	1
letting	1
that	1
old	1
lady,	1
and	1
the	1
civil-spoken	1
young	1
lady	1
there	1
above,	1
have	1
them	1
there	1
rooms	1
for	1
another	1
day.	1
Landlady.	1
Now,	1
Mr.	1
Newington,	1
let	1
me	1
hear	1
no	1
more	1
about	1
that	1
old	1
gentlewoman,	1
and	1
that	1
civil-spoken	1
young	1
lady.	1
Fair	1
words	1
cost	1
nothing;	1
and	1
I've	1
a	1
notion	1
that's	1
the	1
cause	1
they	1
are	1
so	1
plenty	1
with	1
the	1
young	1
lady.	1
Neither	1
o'	1
them,	1
I	1
take	1
it,	1
by	1
what	1
they've	1
ordered	1
since	1
their	1
coming	1
into	1
the	1
house,	1
are	1
such	1
grand	1
folk,	1
that	1
one	1
need	1
be	1
so	1
petticular	1
about	1
them.	1
Landlord.	1
Why,	1
they	1
came	1
only	1
in	1
a	1
chaise	1
and	1
pair,	1
to	1
be	1
sure;	1
I	1
can't	1
deny	1
that.	1
Landlady.	1
But,	1
bless	1
my	1
stars!	1
what	1
signifies	1
talking?	1
Don't	1
you	1
know,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
I	1
do,	1
Mr.	1
Newington,	1
that	1
to-morrow	1
is	1
Eton	1
Montem,	1
and	1
that	1
if	1
we	1
had	1
twenty	1
times	1
as	1
many	1
rooms	1
and	1
as	1
many	1
more	1
to	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
them,	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
one	1
too	1
many	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
company	1
we've	1
a	1
right	1
to	1
expect,	1
and	1
those	1
the	1
highest	1
quality	1
of	1
the	1
land?	1
Nay,	1
what	1
do	1
I	1
talk	1
of	1
to-morrow?	1
isn't	1
my	1
Lady	1
Piercefield	1
and	1
suite	1
expected?	1
and,	1
moreover,	1
Mr.	1
and	1
Miss	1
Bursal's	1
to	1
be	1
here,	1
and	1
will	1
call	1
for	1
as	1
much	1
in	1
an	1
hour	1
as	1
your	1
civil-spoken	1
young	1
lady	1
in	1
a	1
twelvemonth,	1
I	1
reckon.	1
So,	1
Mr.	1
Newington,	1
if	1
you	1
don't	1
think	1
proper	1
to	1
go	1
up	1
and	1
inform	1
the	1
ladies	1
above,	1
that	1
the	1
Dolphin	1
rooms	1
are	1
not	1
for	1
them,	1
I	1
must	1
SPEAK	1
myself,	1
though	1
'tis	1
a	1
thing	1
I	1
never	1
do	1
when	1
I	1
can	1
help	1
it.	1
Landlord	1
(aside).	1
She	1
not	1
like	1
to	1
speak!	1
(Aloud.)	1
My	1
dear,	1
you	1
can	1
speak	1
a	1
power	1
better	1
than	1
I	1
can;	1
so	1
take	1
it	1
all	1
upon	1
yourself,	1
if	1
you	1
please;	1
for,	1
old-fashioned	1
as	1
I	1
and	1
my	1
tankard	1
here	1
be,	1
I	1
can't	1
make	1
a	1
speech	1
that	1
borders	1
on	1
the	1
uncivil	1
order,	1
to	1
a	1
lady	1
like,	1
for	1
the	1
life	1
and	1
lungs	1
of	1
me.	1
So,	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
goodness,	1
do	1
you	1
go	1
up,	1
Mrs.	1
Newington.	1
Landlady.	1
And	1
so	1
I	1
will,	1
Mr.	1
Newington.	1
Help	1
ye!	1
Civilities	1
and	1
rarities	1
are	1
out	1
o'	1
season	1
for	1
them	1
that	1
can't	1
pay	1
for	1
them	1
in	1
this	1
world;	1
and	1
very	1
proper.	1
[Exit	1
Landlady.]	1
Landlord.	1
And	1
very	1
proper!	1
Ha!	1
who	1
comes	1
yonder?	1
The	1
Eton	1
chap	1
who	1
wheedled	1
me	1
into	1
lending	1
him	1
my	1
best	1
hunter	1
last	1
year,	1
and	1
was	1
the	1
ruination	1
of	1
him;	1
but	1
that	1
must	1
be	1
paid	1
for,	1
wheedle	1
or	1
no	1
wheedle;	1
and,	1
for	1
the	1
matter	1
of	1
wheedling,	1
I'd	1
stake	1
this	1
here	1
Mr.	1
Wheeler,	1
that	1
is	1
making	1
up	1
to	1
me,	1
do	1
you	1
see,	1
against	1
e'er	1
a	1
boy,	1
or	1
hobbledehoy,	1
in	1
all	1
Eton,	1
London,	1
or	1
Christendom,	1
let	1
the	1
other	1
be	1
who	1
he	1
will.	1
Enter	1
WHEELER.	1
Wheeler.	1
A	1
fine	1
day,	1
Mr.	1
Newington.	1
Landlord.	1
A	1
fine	1
day,	1
Mr.	1
Wheeler.	1
Wheel.	1
And	1
I	1
hope,	1
for	1
YOUR	1
sake,	1
we	1
may	1
have	1
as	1
fine	1
a	1
day	1
for	1
the	1
Montem	1
to-morrow.	1
It	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
pretty	1
penny	1
in	1
your	1
pocket!	1
Why,	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
will	1
be	1
here;	1
and	1
(looking	1
round	1
at	1
the	1
jellies,	1
etc.)	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
better	1
for	1
them;	1
for	1
here	1
are	1
good	1
things	1
enough,	1
and	1
enough	1
for	1
them.	1
And	1
here's	1
the	1
best	1
thing	1
of	1
all,	1
the	1
good	1
old	1
tankard	1
still;	1
not	1
empty,	1
I	1
hope.	1
Landlord.	1
Not	1
empty,	1
I	1
hope.	1
Here's	1
to	1
you,	1
Mr.	1
Wheeler.	1
Wheel.	1
Mr.	1
Wheeler!--CAPTAIN	1
Wheeler,	1
if	1
you	1
please.	1
Landlord.	1
YOU,	1
Captain	1
Wheeler!	1
Why,	1
I	1
thought	1
in	1
former	1
times	1
it	1
was	1
always	1
the	1
oldest	1
scholar	1
at	1
Eton	1
that	1
was	1
Captain	1
at	1
the	1
Montems;	1
and	1
didn't	1
Mr.	1
Talbot	1
come	1
afore	1
you?	1
Wheel.	1
Not	1
at	1
all;	1
we	1
came	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
day.	1
Some	1
say	1
I	1
came	1
first;	1
some	1
say	1
Talbot.	1
So	1
the	1
choice	1
of	1
which	1
of	1
us	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
captain	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
the	1
vote	1
amongst	1
the	1
lads--most	1
votes	1
carry	1
it;	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
most	1
votes,	1
I	1
fancy;	1
so	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
captain,	1
to-morrow,	1
and	1
a	1
pretty	1
deal	1
of	1
salt*	1
I	1
reckon	1
I	1
shall	1
pocket.	1
Why,	1
the	1
collection	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
Montem,	1
they	1
say,	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
plump	1
thousand!	1
No	1
bad	1
thing	1
for	1
a	1
young	1
fellow	1
to	1
set	1
out	1
with	1
for	1
Oxford	1
or	1
Cambridge--hey?	1
*Salt,	1
the	1
cant	1
name	1
given	1
by	1
the	1
Eton	1
lads	1
to	1
the	1
money	1
collected	1
at	1
Montem.	1
Landlord.	1
And	1
no	1
bad	1
thing,	1
before	1
he	1
sets	1
out	1
for	1
Cambridge	1
or	1
Oxford,	1
'twould	1
be	1
for	1
a	1
young	1
gentleman	1
to	1
pay	1
his	1
debts.	1
Wheel.	1
Debts!	1
Oh,	1
time	1
enough	1
for	1
that.	1
I've	1
a	1
little	1
account	1
with	1
you	1
in	1
horses,	1
I	1
know;	1
but	1
that's	1
between	1
you	1
and	1
me,	1
you	1
know--mum.	1
Landlord.	1
Mum	1
me	1
no	1
mums,	1
Mr.	1
Wheeler.	1
Between	1
you	1
and	1
me,	1
my	1
best	1
hunter	1
has	1
been	1
ruinationed;	1
and	1
I	1
can't	1
afford	1
to	1
be	1
mum.	1
So	1
you'll	1
take	1
no	1
offence	1
if	1
I	1
speak;	1
and	1
as	1
you'll	1
set	1
off	1
to-morrow,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
Montem's	1
over,	1
you'll	1
be	1
pleased	1
to	1
settle	1
with	1
me	1
some	1
way	1
or	1
other	1
to-day,	1
as	1
we've	1
no	1
other	1
time.	1
Wheel.	1
No	1
time	1
so	1
proper,	1
certainly.	1
Where's	1
the	1
little	1
account?--I	1
have	1
money	1
sent	1
me	1
for	1
my	1
Montem	1
dress,	1
and	1
I	1
can	1
squeeze	1
that	1
much	1
out	1
of	1
it.	1
I	1
came	1
home	1
from	1
Eton	1
on	1
purpose	1
to	1
settle	1
with	1
you.	1
But	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
hunter,	1
you	1
must	1
call	1
upon	1
Talbot--do	1
you	1
understand?	1
to	1
pay	1
for	1
him;	1
for	1
though	1
Talbot	1
and	1
I	1
had	1
him	1
the	1
same	1
day,	1
'twas	1
Talbot	1
did	1
for	1
him,	1
and	1
Talbot	1
must	1
pay.	1
I	1
spoke	1
to	1
him	1
about	1
it,	1
and	1
charged	1
him	1
to	1
remember	1
you;	1
for	1
I	1
never	1
forget	1
to	1
speak	1
a	1
good	1
word	1
for	1
my	1
friends.	1
Landlord.	1
So	1
I	1
perceive.	1
Wheel.	1
I'll	1
make	1
bold	1
just	1
to	1
give	1
you	1
my	1
opinion	1
of	1
these	1
jellies	1
whilst	1
you	1
are	1
getting	1
my	1
account,	1
Mr.	1
Newington.	1
(He	1
swallows	1
down	1
a	1
jelly	1
or	1
two--Landlord	1
is	1
going.)	1
Enter	1
TALBOT.	1
Talbot.	1
Hallo,	1
Landlord!	1
where	1
are	1
making	1
off	1
so	1
fast?	1
Here,	1
your	1
jellies	1
are	1
all	1
going	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
yourself.	1
Wheel.	1
(aside).	1
Talbot!--I	1
wish	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
hundred	1
miles	1
off.	1
Landlord.	1
You	1
are	1
heartily	1
welcome,	1
Mr.	1
Talbot.	1
A	1
good	1
morning	1
to	1
you,	1
sir;	1
I'm	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
you--very	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
you,	1
Mr.	1
Talbot.	1
Talb.	1
Then	1
shake	1
hands,	1
my	1
honest	1
landlord.	1
(Talbot,	1
in	1
shaking	1
hands	1
with	1
him,	1
puts	1
a	1
purse	1
into	1
the	1
landlord's	1
hands.)	1
Landlord.	1
What's	1
here?	1
Guineas?	1
Talb.	1
The	1
hunter,	1
you	1
know;	1
since	1
Wheeler	1
won't	1
pay,	1
I	1
must--that's	1
all.	1
Good	1
morning.	1
Wheel.	1
(aside).	1
What	1
a	1
fool!	1
(Landlord,	1
as	1
Talbot	1
is	1
going,	1
catches	1
hold	1
of	1
his	1
coat.)	1
Landlord.	1
Hold,	1
Mr.	1
Talbot,	1
this	1
won't	1
do!	1
Talb.	1
Won't	1
it?	1
Well,	1
then,	1
my	1
watch	1
must	1
go.	1
Landlord.	1
Nay,	1
nay!	1
but	1
you	1
are	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
hurry	1
to	1
pay--you	1
won't	1
hear	1
a	1
man.	1
Half	1
this	1
is	1
enough	1
for	1
your	1
share	1
o'	1
the	1
mischief,	1
in	1
all	1
conscience.	1
Mr.	1
Wheeler,	1
there,	1
had	1
the	1
horse	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
day.	1
Wheel.	1
But	1
Bursal's	1
my	1
witness--	1
Talb.	1
Oh,	1
say	1
no	1
more	1
about	1
witnesses;	1
a	1
man's	1
conscience	1
is	1
always	1
his	1
best	1
witness,	1
or	1
his	1
worst.	1
Landlord,	1
take	1
your	1
money,	1
and	1
no	1
more	1
words.	1
Wheel.	1
This	1
is	1
very	1
genteel	1
of	1
you,	1
Talbot.	1
I	1
always	1
thought	1
you	1
would	1
do	1
the	1
genteel	1
thing	1
as	1
I	1
knew	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
generous	1
and	1
considerate.	1
Talb.	1
Don't	1
waste	1
your	1
fine	1
speeches,	1
Wheeler,	1
I	1
advise	1
you,	1
this	1
election	1
time.	1
Keep	1
them	1
for	1
Bursal	1
or	1
Lord	1
John,	1
or	1
some	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
like	1
them.	1
They	1
won't	1
go	1
down	1
with	1
me.	1
Good	1
morning	1
to	1
you.	1
I	1
give	1
you	1
notice,	1
I'm	1
going	1
back	1
to	1
Eton	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
I	1
can	1
gallop;	1
and	1
who	1
knows	1
what	1
plain	1
speaking	1
may	1
do	1
with	1
the	1
Eton	1
lads?	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
captain	1
yet,	1
Wheeler.	1
Have	1
a	1
care!	1
Is	1
my	1
horse	1
ready	1
there?	1
Landlord.	1
Mr.	1
Talbot's	1
horse,	1
there!	1
Mr.	1
Talbot's	1
horse,	1
I	1
say.	1
Talbot	1
sings.	1
"He	1
carries	1
weight--he	1
rides	1
a	1
race--	1
'Tis	1
for	1
a	1
thousand	1
pound!"	1
(Exit	1
Talbot.)	1
Wheel.	1
And,	1
dear	1
me!	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
left	1
behind.	1
A	1
horse	1
for	1
me,	1
pray;	1
a	1
horse	1
for	1
Mr.	1
Wheeler!	1
(Exit	1
Wheeler.)	1
Landlord	1
(calls	1
very	1
loud).	1
Mr.	1
Talbot's	1
horse!	1
Hang	1
the	1
hostler!	1
I'll	1
saddle	1
him	1
myself.	1
(Exit	1
Landlord.)	1
SCENE	1
II.	1
A	1
Dining	1
room	1
in	1
the	1
Inn	1
at	1
Salt	1
Hill.	1
MRS.	1
TALBOT	1
and	1
LOUISA.	1
Louisa	1
(laughing).	1
With	1
what	1
an	1
air	1
Mrs.	1
Landlady	1
made	1
her	1
exit!	1
Mrs.	1
Talbot.	1
When	1
I	1
was	1
young,	1
they	1
say,	1
I	1
was	1
proud;	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
humble	1
enough	1
now:	1
these	1
petty	1
mortifications	1
do	1
not	1
vex	1
me.	1
Louisa.	1
It	1
is	1
well	1
my	1
brother	1
was	1
gone	1
before	1
Mrs.	1
Landlady	1
made	1
her	1
entree;	1
for	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
her	1
rude	1
speech,	1
he	1
would	1
at	1
least	1
have	1
given	1
her	1
the	1
retort	1
courteous.	1
Mrs.	1
Talb.	1
Now	1
tell	1
me	1
honestly,	1
my	1
Louisa--You	1
were,	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
ago,	1
at	1
Bursal	1
House.	1
Since	1
you	1
have	1
left	1
it	1
and	1
have	1
felt	1
something	1
of	1
the	1
difference	1
that	1
is	1
made	1
in	1
this	1
world	1
between	1
splendour	1
and	1
no	1
splendour,	1
you	1
have	1
never	1
regretted	1
that	1
you	1
did	1
not	1
stay	1
there,	1
and	1
that	1
you	1
did	1
not	1
bear	1
more	1
patiently	1
with	1
Miss	1
Bursal's	1
little	1
airs?	1
Louisa.	1
Never	1
for	1
a	1
moment.	1
At	1
first	1
Miss	1
Bursal	1
paid	1
me	1
a	1
vast	1
deal	1
of	1
attention;	1
but,	1
for	1
what	1
reason	1
I	1
know	1
not,	1
she	1
suddenly	1
changed	1
her	1
manner,	1
grew	1
first	1
strangely	1
cold,	1
then	1
condescendingly	1
familiar,	1
and	1
at	1
last	1
downright	1
rude.	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
guess	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
these	1
variations.	1
Mrs.	1
Talb.	1
(aside)	1
I	1
guess	1
the	1
cause	1
too	1
well.	1
Louisa.	1
But	1
as	1
I	1
perceived	1
the	1
lady	1
was	1
out	1
of	1
tune,	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
haste	1
to	1
leave	1
her.	1
I	1
should	1
make	1
a	1
very	1
bad,	1
and,	1
I	1
am	1
sure,	1
a	1
miserable	1
toad	1
eater.	1
I	1
had	1
much	1
rather,	1
if	1
I	1
were	1
obliged	1
to	1
choose,	1
earn	1
my	1
own	1
bread,	1
than	1
live	1
as	1
toad	1
eater	1
with	1
anybody.	1
Mrs.	1
Talb.	1
Fine	1
talking,	1
dear	1
Louisa!	1
Louisa.	1
Don't	1
you	1
believe	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
earnest,	1
mother!	1
To	1
be	1
sure,	1
you	1
cannot	1
know	1
what	1
I	1
would	1
do,	1
unless	1
I	1
were	1
put	1
to	1
the	1
trial.	1
Mrs.	1
Talb.	1
Nor	1
you	1
either,	1
my	1
dear.	1
(She	1
sighs,	1
and	1
is	1
silent.)	1
Louisa	1
(takes	1
her	1
mother's	1
hand).	1
What	1
is	1
the	1
matter,	1
dear	1
mother?	1
You	1
used	1
to	1
say,	1
that	1
seeing	1
my	1
brother	1
always	1
made	1
you	1
feel	1
ten	1
years	1
younger;	1
yet	1
even	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
here,	1
you	1
had,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
your	1
efforts	1
to	1
conceal	1
them,	1
those	1
sudden	1
fits	1
of	1
sadness.	1
Mrs.	1
Talb.	1
The	1
Montem--is	1
not	1
it	1
to-morrow?	1
Ay,	1
but	1
my	1
boy	1
is	1
not	1
sure	1
of	1
being	1
captain.	1
Louisa.	1
No;	1
there	1
is	1
one	1
Wheeler,	1
who,	1
as	1
he	1
says,	1
is	1
most	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
chosen	1
captain.	1
He	1
has	1
taken	1
prodigious	1
pains	1
to	1
flatter	1
and	1
win	1
over	1
many	1
to	1
his	1
interest.	1
My	1
brother	1
does	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
care	1
about	1
it;	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
avaricious.	1
Mrs.	1
Talb.	1
I	1
love	1
your	1
generous	1
spirit	1
and	1
his!	1
but,	1
alas!	1
my	1
dear,	1
people	1
may	1
live	1
to	1
want,	1
and	1
wish	1
for	1
money,	1
without	1
being	1
avaricious.	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
say	1
a	1
word	1
to	1
Talbot;	1
full	1
of	1
spirits	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
this	1
morning,	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
say	1
a	1
word	1
to	1
him,	1
till	1
after	1
the	1
Montem,	1
of	1
what	1
has	1
happened.	1
Louisa.	1
And	1
what	1
has	1
happened,	1
dear	1
mother?	1
Sit	1
down,--you	1
tremble.	1
Mrs.	1
Talb.	1
(sits	1
down	1
and	1
puts	1
a	1
letter	1
into	1
Louisa's	1
hand.)	1
Read	1
that,	1
love.	1
A	1
messenger	1
brought	1
me	1
that	1
from	1
town	1
a	1
few	1
hours	1
ago.	1
Louisa	1
(reads).	1
"By	1
an	1
express	1
from	1
Portsmouth,	1
we	1
hear	1
the	1
Bombay	1
Castle	1
East	1
Indiaman	1
is	1
lost,	1
with	1
all	1
your	1
fortune	1
on	1
board."	1
ALL!	1
I	1
hope	1
there	1
is	1
something	1
left	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
live	1
upon.	1
Mrs.	1
Talb.	1
About	1
15O	1
pounds	1
a	1
year	1
for	1
us	1
all.	1
Louisa.	1
That	1
is	1
enough,	1
is	1
it	1
not,	1
for	1
YOU?	1
Mrs.	1
Talb.	1
For	1
me,	1
love?	1
I	1
am	1
an	1
old	1
woman,	1
and	1
want	1
but	1
little	1
in	1
this	1
world,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
soon	1
out	1
of	1
it.	1
Louisa	1
(kneels	1
down	1
beside	1
her).	1
Do	1
not	1
speak	1
so,	1
dearest	1
mother.	1
Mrs.	1
Talb.	1
Enough	1
for	1
me,	1
love!	1
Yes,	1
enough,	1
and	1
too	1
much	1
for	1
me.	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
thinking	1
of	1
myself.	1
Louisa.	1
Then,	1
as	1
to	1
my	1
brother,	1
he	1
has	1
such	1
abilities,	1
and	1
such	1
industry,	1
he	1
will	1
make	1
a	1
fortune	1
at	1
the	1
bar	1
for	1
himself,	1
most	1
certainly.	1
Mrs.	1
Talb.	1
But	1
his	1
education	1
is	1
not	1
completed.	1
How	1
shall	1
we	1
provide	1
him	1
with	1
money	1
at	1
Cambridge?	1
Louisa.	1
This	1
Montem.	1
The	1
last	1
time	1
the	1
captain	1
had	1
eight	1
hundred,	1
the	1
time	1
before	1
a	1
thousand,	1
pounds.	1
Oh,	1
I	1
hope--I	1
fear!	1
Now,	1
indeed,	1
I	1
know	1
that,	1
without	1
being	1
avaricious,	1
we	1
may	1
want,	1
and	1
wish	1
for	1
money.	1
(Landlady's	1
voice	1
heard	1
behind	1
the	1
scenes.)	1
Landlady.	1
Waiter!--Miss	1
Bursal's	1
curricle,	1
and	1
Mr.	1
Bursal's	1
vis-a-vis.	1
Run!	1
see	1
that	1
the	1
Dolphin's	1
empty.	1
I	1
say	1
run!--run!	1
Mrs.	1
Talb.	1
I	1
will	1
rest	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
moments	1
upon	1
the	1
sofa,	1
in	1
this	1
bedchamber,	1
before	1
we	1
set	1
off.	1
Louisa	1
(goes	1
to	1
open	1
the	1
door).	1
They	1
have	1
bolted	1
or	1
locked	1
it.	1
How	1
unlucky!	1
(She	1
turns	1
the	1
key,	1
and	1
tries	1
to	1
unlock	1
the	1
door.)	1
Enter	1
WAITER.	1
Waiter.	1
Ladies,	1
I'm	1
sorry--Miss	1
Bursal	1
and	1
Mr.	1
Bursal	1
are	1
come--just	1
coming	1
upstairs.	1
Mrs.	1
Talb.	1
Then,	1
will	1
you	1
be	1
so	1
good,	1
sir,	1
as	1
to	1
unlock	1
this	1
door?	1
(Waiter	1
tries	1
to	1
unlock	1
the	1
door.)	1
Waiter.	1
It	1
must	1
be	1
bolted	1
on	1
the	1
inside.	1
Chambermaid!	1
Sally!	1
Are	1
you	1
within	1
there?	1
Unbolt	1
this	1
door.	1
Mr.	1
Bursal's	1
voice	1
behind	1
the	1
scenes.	1
Mr.	1
Burs.	1
Let	1
me	1
have	1
a	1
basin	1
of	1
good	1
soup	1
directly.	1
Waiter.	1
I'll	1
go	1
round	1
and	1
have	1
the	1
door	1
unbolted	1
immediately,	1
ladies.	1
(Exit	1
Waiter.)	1
Enter	1
MISS	1
BURSAL,	1
in	1
a	1
riding	1
dress,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
long	1
whip.	1
Miss	1
Bursal.	1
Those	1
creatures,	1
the	1
ponies,	1
have	1
a'most	1
pulled	1
my	1
'and	1
off.	1
Who	1
'ave	1
we	1
'ere?	1
Ha!	1
Mrs.	1
Talbot!	1
Louisa,	1
'ow	1
are	1
ye?	1
I'm	1
so	1
vastly	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
you;	1
but	1
I'm	1
so	1
shocked	1
to	1
'ear	1
of	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
the	1
Bombay	1
Castle.	1
Mrs.	1
Talbot,	1
you	1
look	1
but	1
poorly;	1
but	1
this	1
Montem	1
will	1
put	1
everybody	1
in	1
spirits.	1
I	1
'ear	1
everybody's	1
to	1
be	1
'ere;	1
and	1
my	1
brother	1
tells	1
me,	1
'twill	1
be	1
the	1
finest	1
ever	1
seen	1
at	1
HEton.	1
Louisa,	1
my	1
dear,	1
I'm	1
sorry	1
I've	1
not	1
a	1
seat	1
for	1
you	1
in	1
my	1
curricle	1
for	1
to-morrow;	1
but	1
I've	1
promised	1
Lady	1
Betty;	1
so,	1
you	1
know,	1
'tis	1
impossible	1
for	1
me.	1
Louisa.	1
Certainly;	1
and	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
impossible	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
leave	1
my	1
mother	1
at	1
present.	1
Chambermaid	1
(opens	1
the	1
bedchamber	1
door).	1
The	1
room's	1
ready	1
now,	1
ladies.	1
Mrs.	1
Talb.	1
Miss	1
Bursal,	1
we	1
intrude	1
upon	1
you	1
no	1
longer.	1
Miss	1
Burs.	1
Nay,	1
why	1
do	1
you	1
decamp,	1
Mrs.	1
Talbot?	1
I	1
'ad	1
a	1
thousand	1
things	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
you,	1
Louisa;	1
but	1
am	1
so	1
tired	1
and	1
so	1
annoyed--	1
(Seats	1
herself.	1
Exeunt	1
Mrs.	1
Talbot,	1
Louisa	1
and	1
Chambermaid.)	1
Enter	1
MR.	1
BURSAL,	1
with	1
a	1
basin	1
of	1
soup	1
in	1
his	1
hand.	1
Mr.	1
Burs.	1
Well,	1
thank	1
my	1
stars	1
the	1
Airly	1
Castle	1
is	1
safe	1
in	1
the	1
Downs.	1
Miss	1
Burs.	1
Mr.	1
Bursal,	1
can	1
you	1
inform	1
me	1
why	1
Joe,	1
my	1
groom,	1
does	1
not	1
make	1
his	1
appearance?	1
Mr.	1
Burs.	1
(eating	1
and	1
speaking).	1
Yes,	1
that	1
I	1
can,	1
child;	1
because	1
he	1
is	1
with	1
his	1
'orses,	1
where	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
be.	1
'Tis	1
fit	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
looked	1
after	1
well;	1
for	1
they	1
cost	1
me	1
a	1
pretty	1
penny--more	1
than	1
their	1
heads	1
are	1
worth,	1
and	1
yours	1
into	1
the	1
bargain;	1
but	1
I	1
was	1
resolved,	1
as	1
we	1
were	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
this	1
Montem,	1
to	1
come	1
in	1
style.	1
Miss	1
Burs.	1
In	1
style,	1
to	1
be	1
sure;	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
world's	1
to	1
be	1
here--the	1
King,	1
the	1
Prince	1
of	1
WHales,	1
and	1
Duke	1
o'	1
York,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
first	1
people;	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
cut	1
a	1
dash!	1
Dash!	1
dash!	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
word	1
to-morrow!--	1
(playing	1
with	1
her	1
whip).	1
Mr.	1
Burs.	1
(aside).	1
Dash!	1
dash!	1
ay,	1
just	1
like	1
her	1
brother.	1
He'll	1
pay	1
away	1
finely,	1
I	1
warrant,	1
by	1
the	1
time	1
he's	1
her	1
age.	1
Well,	1
well,	1
he	1
can	1
afford	1
it;	1
and	1
I	1
do	1
love	1
to	1
see	1
my	1
children	1
make	1
a	1
figure	1
for	1
their	1
money.	1
As	1
Jack	1
Bursal	1
says,	1
what's	1
money	1
for,	1
if	1
it	1
e'nt	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
figure.	1
(Aloud).	1
There's	1
your,	1
brother	1
Jack,	1
now.	1
The	1
extravagant	1
dog!	1
he'll	1
have	1
such	1
a	1
dress	1
as	1
never	1
was	1
seen,	1
I	1
suppose,	1
at	1
this	1
here	1
Montem.	1
Why,	1
now,	1
Jack	1
Bursal	1
spends	1
more	1
money	1
at	1
Eton,	1
and	1
has	1
more	1
to	1
spend,	1
than	1
my	1
Lord	1
John,	1
though	1
my	1
Lord	1
John's	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
a	1
marchioness.	1
Miss	1
Burs.	1
Oh,	1
that	1
makes	1
no	1
difference	1
nowadays.	1
I	1
wonder	1
whether	1
her	1
ladyship	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
this	1
Montem.	1
The	1
only	1
good	1
I	1
ever	1
got	1
out	1
of	1
these	1
stupid	1
Talbots	1
was	1
an	1
introduction	1
to	1
their	1
friend	1
Lady	1
Piercefield.	1
What	1
she	1
could	1
find	1
to	1
like	1
in	1
the	1
Talbots,	1
heaven	1
knows.	1
I've	1
a	1
notion	1
she'll	1
drop	1
them,	1
when	1
she	1
hears	1
of	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
the	1
Bombay	1
Castle.	1
Enter	1
a	1
WAITER,	1
with	1
a	1
note.	1
Waiter.	1
A	1
note	1
from	1
my	1
Lady	1
Piercefield,	1
sir.	1
Miss	1
B.	1
Charming	1
woman!	1
Is	1
she	1
here,	1
pray,	1
sir?	1
Waiter.	1
Just	1
come.	1
Yes,	1
ma'am.	1
(Exit	1
Waiter.)	1
Miss	1
B.	1
Well,	1
Mr.	1
Bursal,	1
what	1
is	1
it?	1
Mr.	1
B.	1
(reads).	1
"Business	1
of	1
importance	1
to	1
communicate--"	1
Hum!	1
what	1
can	1
it	1
be?--(going).	1
Miss	1
B.	1
(aside).	1
Perhaps	1
some	1
match	1
to	1
propose	1
for	1
me!	1
(Aloud).	1
Mr.	1
Bursal,	1
pray	1
before	1
you	1
go	1
to	1
her	1
ladyship,	1
do	1
send	1
my	1
OOMAN	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
make	1
me	1
presentable.	1
(Exit	1
Miss	1
Bursal	1
at	1
one	1
door.)	1
Mr.	1
B.	1
(at	1
the	1
opposite	1
door).	1
"Business	1
of	1
importance!"	1
Hum!	1
I'm	1
glad	1
I'm	1
prepared	1
with	1
a	1
good	1
basin	1
of	1
soup.	1
There's	1
no	1
doing	1
business	1
well	1
upon	1
an	1
empty	1
stomach.	1
Perhaps	1
the	1
business	1
is	1
to	1
lend	1
cash;	1
and	1
I've	1
no	1
great	1
stomach	1
for	1
that.	1
But	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
an	1
honour,	1
to	1
be	1
sure.	1
(Exit.)	1
SCENE	1
III.	1
Landlady's	1
Parlour.	1
LANDLADY--MR.	1
FINSBURY,	1
a	1
man-milliner,	1
with	1
bandboxes--a	1
fancy	1
cap,	1
or	1
helmet,	1
with	1
feathers,	1
in	1
the	1
Landlady's	1
hand--a	1
satin	1
bag,	1
covered	1
with	1
gold	1
netting,	1
in	1
the	1
man-milliner's	1
hand--a	1
mantle	1
hanging	1
over	1
his	1
arm.	1
A	1
rough	1
looking	1
Farmer	1
is	1
sitting	1
with	1
his	1
back	1
towards	1
them,	1
eating	1
bread	1
and	1
cheese,	1
and	1
reading	1
a	1
newspaper.	1
Landlady.	1
Well,	1
this,	1
to	1
be	1
sure,	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
best	1
dressed	1
Montem	1
that	1
ever	1
was	1
seen	1
at	1
Eton;	1
and	1
you	1
Lon'on	1
gentlemen	1
have	1
the	1
most	1
fashionablest	1
notions;	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
most	1
elegantest	1
fancy	1
cap--	1
Finsbury.	1
Why,	1
as	1
you	1
observe,	1
ma'm,	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
most	1
elegant	1
fancy	1
cap	1
of	1
them	1
all.	1
That	1
is	1
Mr.	1
Hector	1
Hogmorton's	1
fancy	1
cap,	1
ma'm;	1
and	1
here,	1
ma'm,	1
is	1
Mr.	1
Saul's	1
rich	1
satin	1
bag,	1
covered	1
with	1
gold	1
net.	1
He	1
is	1
college	1
salt	1
bearer,	1
I	1
understand,	1
and	1
has	1
a	1
prodigious	1
superb	1
white	1
and	1
gold	1
dress.	1
But,	1
in	1
my	1
humble	1
opinion,	1
ma'm,	1
the	1
marshal's	1
white	1
and	1
purple	1
and	1
orange	1
fancy	1
dress,	1
trimmed	1
with	1
silver,	1
will	1
bear	1
the	1
bell;	1
though,	1
indeed,	1
I	1
shouldn't	1
say	1
that,--for	1
the	1
colonel's	1
and	1
lieutenant's,	1
and	1
ensign's,	1
are	1
beautiful	1
in	1
the	1
extreme.	1
And,	1
to	1
be	1
sure,	1
nothing	1
could	1
be	1
better	1
imagined	1
than	1
Mr.	1
Marlborough's	1
lilac	1
and	1
silver,	1
with	1
a	1
Roman	1
cap.	1
And	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
allowed	1
that	1
nothing	1
in	1
nature	1
can	1
have	1
a	1
better	1
effect	1
than	1
Mr.	1
Drake's	1
flesh-colour	1
and	1
blue,	1
with	1
this	1
Spanish	1
hat,	1
ma'm,	1
you	1
see.	1
(The	1
farmer	1
looks	1
over	1
his	1
shoulder	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time	1
during	1
this	1
speech,	1
with	1
contempt.)	1
Farmer	1
(reads	1
the	1
newspaper).	1
French	1
fleet	1
at	1
sea--Hum!	1
Landlady.	1
O	1
gemini:	1
Mr.	1
Drake's	1
Spanish	1
hat	1
is	1
the	1
sweetest,	1
tastiest	1
thing!	1
Mr.	1
Finsbury,	1
I	1
protest--	1
Finsb.	1
Why,	1
ma'm,	1
I	1
knew	1
a	1
lady	1
of	1
your	1
taste	1
couldn't	1
but	1
approve	1
of	1
it.	1
My	1
own	1
invention	1
entirely,	1
ma'm.	1
But	1
it's	1
nothing	1
to	1
the	1
captain's	1
cap,	1
ma'm.	1
Indeed,	1
ma'm,	1
Mr.	1
Wheeler,	1
the	1
captain	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
be,	1
has	1
the	1
prettiest	1
taste	1
in	1
dress.	1
To	1
be	1
sure,	1
his	1
sandals	1
were	1
my	1
suggestion;	1
but	1
the	1
mantle	1
he	1
has	1
the	1
entire	1
credit	1
of,	1
to	1
do	1
him	1
justice;	1
and	1
when	1
you	1
see	1
it,	1
ma'm,	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
really	1
surprised;	1
for	1
(for	1
contrast,	1
and	1
elegance,	1
and	1
richness,	1
and	1
lightness,	1
and	1
propriety,	1
and	1
effect,	1
and	1
costume)	1
you've	1
never	1
yet	1
seen	1
anything	1
at	1
all	1
to	1
be	1
compared	1
to	1
Captain	1
Wheeler's	1
mantle,	1
ma'm.	1
Farmer	1
(to	1
the	1
Landlady).	1
Why,	1
now,	1
pray,	1
Mrs.	1
Landlady,	1
how	1
long	1
may	1
it	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
fashion	1
for	1
milliners	1
to	1
go	1
about	1
in	1
men's	1
clothes?	1
Landlady	1
(aside	1
to	1
Farmer).	1
Lord,	1
Mr.	1
Hearty,	1
hush!	1
This	1
is	1
Mr.	1
Finsbury,	1
the	1
great	1
man-milliner.	1
Farm.	1
The	1
great	1
man-milliner!	1
This	1
is	1
a	1
sight	1
I	1
never	1
thought	1
to	1
see	1
in	1
Old	1
England.	1
Finsb.	1
(packing	1
up	1
band	1
boxes).	1
Well,	1
ma'm,	1
I'm	1
glad	1
I	1
have	1
your	1
approbation.	1
It	1
has	1
ever	1
been	1
my	1
study	1
to	1
please	1
the	1
ladies.	1
Farm.	1
(throws	1
a	1
fancy	1
mantle	1
over	1
his	1
frieze	1
coat).	1
And	1
is	1
this	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
please	1
the	1
ladies,	1
Mrs.	1
Landlady,	1
nowadays?	1
Finsb.	1
(taking	1
off	1
the	1
mantle).	1
Sir,	1
with	1
your	1
leave--I	1
ask	1
pardon--but	1
the	1
least	1
thing	1
detriments	1
these	1
tender	1
colours;	1
and	1
as	1
you	1
have	1
just	1
been	1
eating	1
cheese	1
with	1
your	1
hands--	1
Farm.	1
'Tis	1
my	1
way	1
to	1
eat	1
cheese	1
with	1
my	1
mouth,	1
man.	1
Finsb.	1
MAN!	1
Farm.	1
I	1
ask	1
pardon--man-milliner,	1
I	1
mean.	1
Enter	1
LANDLORD.	1
Landlord.	1
Why,	1
wife!	1
Landlady.	1
Wife!	1
Landlord.	1
I	1
ask	1
pardon--Mrs.	1
Newington,	1
I	1
mean.	1
Do	1
you	1
know	1
who	1
them	1
ladies	1
are	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
been	1
and	1
turned	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
Dolphin?	1
Landlady	1
(alarmed).	1
Not	1
I,	1
indeed.	1
Who	1
are	1
they,	1
pray?	1
Why,	1
if	1
they	1
are	1
quality	1
it's	1
no	1
fault	1
of	1
mine.	1
It	1
is	1
their	1
own	1
fault	1
for	1
coming,	1
like	1
scrubs,	1
without	1
four	1
horses.	1
Why,	1
if	1
quality	1
will	1
travel	1
the	1
road	1
this	1
way,	1
incognito,	1
how	1
can	1
they	1
expect	1
to	1
be	1
known	1
and	1
treated	1
as	1
quality?	1
'Tis	1
no	1
fault	1
of	1
mine.	1
Why	1
didn't	1
you	1
find	1
out	1
sooner	1
who	1
they	1
were,	1
Mr.	1
Newington?	1
What	1
else,	1
in	1
the	1
'versal	1
world	1
have	1
you	1
to	1
do,	1
but	1
to	1
go	1
basking	1
about	1
in	1
the	1
yards	1
and	1
places	1
with	1
your	1
tankard	1
in	1
your	1
hand,	1
from	1
morning	1
till	1
night?	1
What	1
have	1
you	1
else	1
to	1
ruminate,	1
all	1
day	1
long,	1
but	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
who's	1
who,	1
I	1
say?	1
Farm.	1
Clapper!	1
clapper!	1
clapper!	1
like	1
my	1
mill	1
in	1
a	1
high	1
wind,	1
landlord.	1
Clapper!	1
clapper!	1
clapper!--enough	1
to	1
stun	1
a	1
body.	1
Landlord.	1
That	1
is	1
not	1
used	1
to	1
it;	1
but	1
use	1
is	1
all,	1
they	1
say.	1
Landlady.	1
Will	1
you	1
answer	1
me,	1
Mr.	1
Newington?	1
Who	1
are	1
the	1
grandees	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
Dolphin?--and	1
what's	1
become	1
on	1
them?	1
Landlord.	1
Grandees	1
was	1
your	1
own	1
word,	1
wife.	1
They	1
be	1
not	1
to	1
call	1
grandees;	1
but	1
I	1
reckon	1
you'd	1
be	1
sorry	1
not	1
to	1
treat	1
'em	1
civil,	1
when	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
their	1
name	1
is	1
Talbot,	1
mother	1
and	1
sister	1
to	1
our	1
young	1
Talbot,	1
of	1
Eton;	1
he	1
that	1
paid	1
me	1
so	1
handsome	1
for	1
the	1
hunter	1
this	1
very	1
morning.	1
Landlady.	1
Mercy!	1
is	1
that	1
all?	1
What	1
a	1
combustion	1
for	1
nothing	1
in	1
life!	1
Finsb.	1
For	1
nothing	1
in	1
life,	1
as	1
you	1
say,	1
ma'm;	1
that	1
is,	1
nothing	1
in	1
high	1
life,	1
I'm	1
sure,	1
ma'm;	1
nay,	1
I	1
dare	1
a'most	1
venture	1
to	1
swear.	1
Would	1
you	1
believe	1
it,	1
Mr.	1
Talbot	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
few	1
young	1
gentlemen	1
of	1
Eton	1
that	1
has	1
not	1
bespoke	1
from	1
me	1
a	1
fancy	1
dress	1
for	1
this	1
grand	1
Montem?	1
Landlady.	1
There,	1
Mr.	1
Newington;	1
there's	1
your	1
Talbot	1
for	1
you!	1
and	1
there's	1
your	1
grandees!	1
O	1
trust	1
me,	1
I	1
know	1
your	1
scrubs	1
at	1
first	1
sight.	1
Landlord.	1
Scrubs,	1
I	1
don't,	1
nor	1
can't,	1
nor	1
won't	1
call	1
them	1
that	1
pay	1
their	1
debts	1
honestly.	1
Scrubs,	1
I	1
don't,	1
nor	1
won't,	1
nor	1
can't,	1
call	1
them	1
that	1
behave	1
as	1
handsome	1
as	1
young	1
Mr.	1
Talbot	1
did	1
here	1
to	1
me	1
this	1
morning	1
about	1
the	1
hunter.	1
A	1
scrub	1
he	1
is	1
not,	1
wife.	1
Fancy-dress	1
or	1
no	1
fancy-dress,	1
Mr.	1
Finsbury,	1
this	1
young	1
gentleman	1
is	1
no	1
scrub.	1
Finsb.	1
Dear	1
me!	1
'Twas	1
not	1
I	1
said	1
SCRUB.	1
Did	1
I	1
say	1
scrub?	1
Farm.	1
No	1
matter	1
if	1
you	1
did.	1
Finsb.	1
No	1
matter,	1
certainly;	1
and	1
yet	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
matter;	1
for	1
I'm	1
confident	1
I	1
wouldn't	1
for	1
the	1
world	1
leave	1
it	1
in	1
anyone's	1
power	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
I	1
said--	1
that	1
I	1
called--any	1
young	1
gentleman	1
of	1
Eton	1
a	1
SCRUB!	1
Why,	1
you	1
know,	1
sir,	1
it	1
might	1
breed	1
a	1
riot!	1
Farm.	1
And	1
a	1
pretty	1
figure	1
you'd	1
make	1
in	1
a	1
riot!	1
Landlady.	1
Pray	1
let	1
me	1
hear	1
nothing	1
about	1
riots	1
in	1
my	1
house.	1
Farm.	1
Nor	1
about	1
scrubs.	1
Finsb.	1
But	1
I	1
beg	1
leave	1
to	1
explain,	1
gentlemen.	1
All	1
I	1
ventured	1
to	1
remark	1
or	1
suggest	1
was,	1
that	1
as	1
there	1
was	1
some	1
talk	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Talbot's	1
being	1
captain	1
to-morrow,	1
I	1
didn't	1
conceive	1
how	1
he	1
could	1
well	1
appear	1
without	1
any	1
dress.	1
That	1
was	1
all,	1
upon	1
my	1
word	1
and	1
honour.	1
A	1
good	1
morning	1
to	1
you,	1
gentlemen;	1
it	1
is	1
time	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
off.	1
Mrs.	1
Newington,	1
you	1
were	1
so	1
obliging	1
as	1
to	1
promise	1
to	1
accommodate	1
me	1
with	1
a	1
return	1
chaise	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
Eton.	1
(Finsbury	1
bows	1
and	1
exit.)	1
Farm.	1
A	1
good	1
day	1
to	1
you	1
and	1
your	1
bandboxes.	1
There's	1
a	1
fellow	1
for	1
you	1
now!	1
Ha!	1
ha!	1
ha!--A	1
man-milliner,	1
forsooth!	1
Landlord.	1
Mrs.	1
Talbot's	1
coming--stand	1
back.	1
Landlady.	1
Lord!	1
why	1
does	1
Bob	1
show	1
them	1
through	1
this	1
way?	1
Enter	1
MRS.	1
TALBOT,	1
leaning	1
on	1
LOUISA;	1
Waiter	1
showing	1
the	1
way.	1
Landlady.	1
You	1
are	1
going	1
on,	1
I	1
suppose,	1
ma'am?	1
Waiter	1
(aside	1
to	1
Landlord).	1
Not	1
if	1
she	1
could	1
help	1
it;	1
but	1
there's	1
no	1
beds,	1
since	1
Mr.	1
Bursal	1
and	1
Miss	1
Bursal's	1
come.	1
Landlord.	1
I	1
say	1
nothing,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
vain	1
to	1
say	1
more.	1
But	1
isn't	1
it	1
a	1
pity	1
she	1
can't	1
stay	1
for	1
the	1
Montem,	1
poor	1
old	1
lady!	1
Her	1
son--as	1
good	1
and	1
fine	1
a	1
lad	1
as	1
ever	1
you	1
saw--they	1
say,	1
has	1
a	1
chance,	1
too,	1
of	1
being	1
captain.	1
She	1
may	1
never	1
live	1
to	1
see	1
another	1
such	1
a	1
sight.	1
(As	1
Mrs.	1
Talbot	1
walks	1
slowly	1
on,	1
the	1
Farmer	1
puts	1
himself	1
across	1
her	1
way,	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
stop	1
her	1
short.)	1
Farm.	1
No	1
offence,	1
madam,	1
I	1
hope;	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
good	1
snug	1
farm	1
house,	1
not	1
far	1
off	1
hand;	1
and	1
if	1
so	1
be	1
you'd	1
be	1
so	1
good	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
night's	1
lodging,	1
you	1
and	1
the	1
young	1
lady	1
with	1
you,	1
you'd	1
have	1
a	1
hearty	1
welcome.	1
That's	1
all	1
I	1
can	1
say	1
and	1
you'd	1
make	1
my	1
wife	1
very	1
happy;	1
for	1
she's	1
a	1
good	1
woman,	1
to	1
say	1
nothing	1
of	1
myself.	1
Landlord.	1
If	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
so	1
bold	1
to	1
put	1
in	1
my	1
word,	1
madam,	1
you'd	1
have	1
as	1
good	1
beds,	1
and	1
be	1
as	1
well	1
lodged,	1
with	1
Farmer	1
Hearty,	1
as	1
in	1
e'er	1
a	1
house	1
at	1
Salt	1
Hill.	1
Mrs.	1
Talb.	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
much	1
obliged--	1
Farm.	1
O,	1
say	1
nothing	1
o'	1
that,	1
madam.	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
much	1
obliged	1
if	1
you	1
do	1
come.	1
Do,	1
miss,	1
speak	1
for	1
me.	1
Louisa.	1
Pray,	1
dear	1
mother--	1
Farm.	1
She	1
will.	1
(Calls	1
behind	1
the	1
scenes.)	1
Here,	1
waiter!	1
hostler!	1
driver!	1
what's	1
your	1
name?	1
drive	1
the	1
chaise	1
up	1
here	1
to	1
the	1
door,	1
smart,	1
close.	1
Lean	1
on	1
my	1
arm,	1
madam,	1
and	1
we'll	1
have	1
you	1
in	1
and	1
home	1
in	1
a	1
whiff.	1
(Exeunt	1
Mrs.	1
Talbot,	1
Louisa,	1
Farmer,	1
Landlord	1
and	1
Waiter.)	1
Landlady	1
(sola).	1
What	1
a	1
noise	1
and	1
a	1
rout	1
this	1
farmer	1
man	1
makes!	1
and	1
my	1
husband,	1
with	1
his	1
great	1
broad	1
face,	1
bowing,	1
as	1
great	1
a	1
nincompoop	1
as	1
t'other.	1
The	1
folks	1
are	1
all	1
bewitched	1
with	1
the	1
old	1
woman,	1
I	1
verily	1
believe.	1
(Aloud.)	1
A	1
good	1
morning	1
to	1
you,	1
ladies.	1
END	1
OF	1
THE	1
FIRST	1
ACT.	1
ACT	1
THE	1
SECOND.	1
SCENE	1
I.	1
A	1
field	1
near	1
Eton	1
College;--several	1
boys	1
crossing	1
backwards	1
and	1
forwards	1
in	1
the	1
back-ground.	1
In	1
front,	1
TALBOT,	1
WHEELER,	1
LORD	1
JOHN	1
and	1
BURSAL.	1
Talbot.	1
Fair	1
play,	1
Wheeler!	1
Have	1
at	1
'em,	1
my	1
boy!	1
There	1
they	1
stand,	1
fair	1
game!	1
There's	1
Bursal	1
there,	1
with	1
his	1
dead	1
forty-five	1
votes	1
at	1
command;	1
and	1
Lord	1
John	1
with	1
his--how	1
many	1
live	1
friends?	1
Lord	1
John	1
(coolly).	1
Sir,	1
I	1
have	1
fifty-six	1
friends,	1
I	1
believe.	1
Talb.	1
Fifty-six	1
friends,	1
his	1
lordship	1
believes--Wheeler	1
inclusive,	1
no	1
doubt.	1
Lord	1
J.	1
That's	1
as	1
hereafter	1
may	1
be.	1
Wheeler.	1
Hereafter!	1
Oh,	1
fie,	1
my	1
LUD!	1
You	1
know	1
your	1
own	1
Wheeler	1
has,	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
minute	1
he	1
ever	1
saw	1
you,	1
been	1
your	1
fast	1
friend.	1
Talb.	1
Your	1
fast	1
friend	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
minute	1
he	1
ever	1
saw	1
you,	1
my	1
lord!	1
That's	1
well	1
hit,	1
Wheeler;	1
stick	1
to	1
that;	1
stick	1
fast.	1
Fifty-six	1
friends,	1
Wheeler	1
INclusive,	1
hey,	1
my	1
lord!	1
hey,	1
my	1
LUD!	1
Lord	1
J.	1
Talbot	1
EXclusive,	1
I	1
find,	1
contrary	1
to	1
my	1
expectations.	1
Talb.	1
Ay,	1
contrary	1
to	1
your	1
expectations,	1
you	1
find	1
that	1
Talbot	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
dog	1
that	1
will	1
lick	1
the	1
dust:	1
but	1
then	1
there's	1
enough	1
of	1
the	1
true	1
spaniel	1
breed	1
to	1
be	1
had	1
for	1
whistling	1
for;	1
hey,	1
Wheeler?	1
Bursal	1
(aside	1
to	1
Wheeler).	1
A	1
pretty	1
electioneerer.	1
So	1
much	1
the	1
better	1
for	1
you,	1
Wheeler.	1
Why,	1
unless	1
he	1
bought	1
a	1
vote,	1
he'd	1
never	1
win	1
one,	1
if	1
he	1
talked	1
from	1
this	1
to	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
judgment.	1
Wheeler	1
(aside	1
to	1
Bursal).	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
has	1
no	1
money	1
to	1
buy	1
votes--he!	1
he!	1
he!--we	1
are	1
safe	1
enough.	1
Talb.	1
That's	1
well	1
done,	1
Wheeler;	1
fight	1
the	1
by-battle	1
there	1
with	1
Bursal.	1
Now	1
you	1
are	1
sure	1
of	1
the	1
main	1
with	1
Lord	1
John.	1
Lord	1
J.	1
Sure!	1
I	1
never	1
made	1
Mr.	1
Wheeler	1
any	1
promise	1
yet.	1
Wheel.	1
O;	1
I	1
ask	1
no	1
promise	1
from	1
his	1
lordship;	1
we	1
are	1
upon	1
honour:	1
I	1
trust	1
entirely	1
to	1
his	1
lordship's	1
good	1
nature	1
and	1
generosity,	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
regard	1
for	1
his	1
own	1
family;	1
I	1
having	1
the	1
honour,	1
though	1
distantly,	1
to	1
be	1
related.	1
Lord	1
J.	1
Related!	1
How,	1
Wheeler?	1
Wheel.	1
Connected,	1
I	1
mean,	1
which	1
is	1
next	1
door,	1
as	1
I	1
may	1
say,	1
to	1
being	1
related.	1
Related	1
slipped	1
out	1
by	1
mistake;	1
I	1
beg	1
pardon,	1
my	1
Lord	1
John.	1
Lord	1
J.	1
Related!--a	1
strange	1
mistake,	1
Wheeler.	1
Talb.	1
Overshot	1
yourself,	1
Wheeler;	1
overshot	1
yourself,	1
by	1
all	1
that's	1
awkward.	1
And	1
yet,	1
till	1
now,	1
I	1
always	1
took	1
you	1
for	1
"a	1
dead-shot	1
at	1
a	1
yellow-hammer."*	1
*Young	1
noblemen	1
at	1
Oxford	1
wear	1
yellow	1
tufts	1
at	1
the	1
tops	1
of	1
their	1
caps.	1
Hence	1
their	1
flatterers	1
are	1
said	1
to	1
be	1
dead-shots	1
at	1
yellow-hammers.	1
Wheel.	1
(taking	1
Bursal	1
by	1
the	1
arm).	1
Bursal,	1
a	1
word	1
with	1
you.	1
(Aside	1
to	1
Bursal.)	1
What	1
a	1
lump	1
of	1
family	1
pride	1
that	1
Lord	1
John	1
is.	1
Talb.	1
Keep	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
hearing,	1
Wheeler,	1
lest	1
I	1
should	1
spoil	1
sport.	1
But	1
never	1
fear:	1
you'll	1
please	1
Bursal	1
sooner	1
than	1
I	1
shall.	1
I	1
can't,	1
for	1
the	1
soul	1
of	1
me,	1
bring	1
myself	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
Bursal's	1
not	1
purse-proud,	1
and	1
you	1
can.	1
Give	1
you	1
joy.	1
Burs.	1
A	1
choice	1
electioneerer!--ha!	1
ha!	1
ha!	1
Wheel.	1
(faintly).	1
He!	1
he!	1
he!--a	1
choice	1
electioneerer,	1
as	1
you	1
say.	1
(Exeunt	1
Wheeler	1
and	1
Bursal;	1
manent	1
Lord	1
J.	1
and	1
Talbot.)	1
Lord	1
J.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
time,	1
Talbot--	1
Talb.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
time,	1
my	1
lord--to	1
save	1
trouble	1
and	1
a	1
long	1
explanation-	1
-there	1
was	1
a	1
time	1
when	1
you	1
liked	1
Talbots	1
better	1
than	1
spaniels;	1
you	1
understand	1
me?	1
Lord	1
J.	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
it	1
very	1
difficult	1
to	1
understand	1
you	1
of	1
late,	1
Mr.	1
Talbot.	1
Talb.	1
Yes,	1
because	1
you	1
have	1
used	1
other	1
people's	1
understandings	1
instead	1
of	1
your	1
own.	1
Be	1
yourself,	1
my	1
lord.	1
See	1
with	1
your	1
own	1
eyes,	1
and	1
hear	1
with	1
your	1
own	1
ears,	1
and	1
then	1
you'll	1
find	1
me	1
still,	1
what	1
I've	1
been	1
these	1
seven	1
years;	1
not	1
your	1
understrapper,	1
your	1
hanger-on,	1
your	1
flatterer,	1
but	1
your	1
friend!	1
If	1
you	1
choose	1
to	1
have	1
me	1
for	1
a	1
friend,	1
here's	1
my	1
hand.	1
I	1
am	1
your	1
friend,	1
and	1
you'll	1
not	1
find	1
a	1
better.	1
Lord	1
J.	1
(giving	1
his	1
hand).	1
You	1
are	1
a	1
strange	1
fellow,	1
Talbot;	1
I	1
thought	1
I	1
never	1
could	1
have	1
forgiven	1
you	1
for	1
what	1
you	1
said	1
last	1
night.	1
Talb.	1
What?	1
for	1
I	1
don't	1
keep	1
a	1
register	1
of	1
my	1
sayings.	1
Oh,	1
it	1
was	1
something	1
about	1
gaming--Wheeler	1
was	1
flattering	1
your	1
taste	1
for	1
it,	1
and	1
he	1
put	1
me	1
into	1
a	1
passion--I	1
forget	1
what	1
I	1
said.	1
But,	1
whatever	1
it	1
was,	1
I'm	1
sure	1
it	1
was	1
well	1
meant,	1
and	1
I	1
believe	1
it	1
was	1
well	1
said.	1
Lord	1
J.	1
But	1
you	1
laugh	1
at	1
me	1
sometimes	1
to	1
my	1
face.	1
Talb.	1
Would	1
you	1
rather	1
I	1
should	1
laugh	1
at	1
you	1
behind	1
your	1
back?	1
Lord.	1
J.	1
But	1
of	1
all	1
things	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
I	1
hate	1
to	1
be	1
laughed	1
at.	1
Listen	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
don't	1
fumble	1
in	1
your	1
pockets	1
while	1
I'm	1
talking	1
to	1
you.	1
Talb.	1
I'm	1
fumbling	1
for--oh,	1
here	1
it	1
is.	1
Now,	1
Lord	1
John,	1
I	1
once	1
did	1
laugh	1
at	1
you	1
behind	1
your	1
back,	1
and	1
what's	1
droll	1
enough,	1
it	1
was	1
at	1
your	1
back	1
I	1
laughed.	1
Here's	1
a	1
caricature	1
I	1
drew	1
of	1
you--I	1
really	1
am	1
sorry	1
I	1
did	1
it;	1
but	1
'tis	1
best	1
to	1
show	1
it	1
to	1
you	1
myself.	1
Lord	1
J.	1
(aside).	1
It	1
is	1
all	1
I	1
can	1
do	1
to	1
forgive	1
this.	1
(After	1
a	1
pause,	1
he	1
tears	1
the	1
paper.)	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
this	1
caricature	1
before;	1
but	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
expect,	1
Talbot,	1
that	1
you	1
would	1
come	1
and	1
show	1
it	1
to	1
me,	1
yourself,	1
Talbot,	1
so	1
handsomely,	1
especially	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
time	1
as	1
this.	1
Wheeler	1
might	1
well	1
say	1
you	1
are	1
a	1
bad	1
electioneerer.	1
Talb.	1
Oh,	1
hang	1
it!	1
I	1
forgot	1
my	1
election,	1
and	1
your	1
fifty-six	1
friends.	1
Enter	1
RORY	1
O'RYAN.	1
Rory	1
(claps	1
Talbot	1
on	1
the	1
back).	1
Fifty-six	1
friends,	1
have	1
you,	1
Talbot?	1
Say	1
seven--fifty-seven,	1
I	1
mean;	1
for	1
I'll	1
lay	1
you	1
a	1
wager,	1
you've	1
forget	1
me;	1
and	1
that's	1
a	1
shame	1
for	1
you,	1
too;	1
for	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
posse-comitatus	1
entirely	1
now,	1
you	1
have	1
not	1
a	1
stauncher	1
friend	1
than	1
Poor	1
little	1
Rory	1
O'Ryan.	1
And	1
a	1
good	1
right	1
he	1
has	1
to	1
befriend	1
you;	1
for	1
you	1
stood	1
by	1
him	1
when	1
many	1
who	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
known	1
better	1
were	1
hunting	1
him	1
down	1
for	1
a	1
wild	1
Irishman.	1
Now	1
that	1
same	1
wild	1
Irishman	1
has	1
as	1
much	1
gratitude	1
in	1
him	1
as	1
any	1
tame	1
Englishman	1
of	1
them	1
all.	1
But	1
don't	1
let's	1
be	1
talking	1
sintimint;	1
for,	1
for	1
my	1
share	1
I'd	1
not	1
give	1
a	1
bogberry	1
a	1
bushel	1
for	1
sintimint,	1
when	1
I	1
could	1
get	1
anything	1
better.	1
Lord	1
J.	1
And	1
pray,	1
sir,	1
what	1
may	1
a	1
bogberry	1
be?	1
Rory.	1
Phoo!	1
don't	1
be	1
playing	1
the	1
innocent,	1
now.	1
Where	1
have	1
you	1
lived	1
all	1
your	1
life	1
(I	1
ask	1
pardon,	1
my	1
LARD)	1
not	1
to	1
know	1
a	1
bogberry	1
when	1
you	1
see	1
or	1
hear	1
of	1
it?	1
(Turns	1
to	1
Talbot.)	1
But	1
what	1
are	1
ye	1
standing	1
idling	1
here	1
for?	1
Sure,	1
there's	1
Wheeler,	1
and	1
Bursal	1
along	1
with	1
him,	1
canvassing	1
out	1
yonder	1
at	1
a	1
terrible	1
fine	1
rate.	1
And	1
haven't	1
I	1
been	1
huzzaing	1
for	1
you	1
there	1
till	1
I'm	1
hoarse?	1
So	1
I	1
am,	1
and	1
just	1
stepped	1
away	1
to	1
suck	1
an	1
orange	1
for	1
my	1
voice--(sucks	1
an	1
orange.)	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
THOROUGH	1
GOING	1
friend,	1
at	1
anyrate.	1
Talb.	1
Now,	1
Rory,	1
you	1
are	1
the	1
best	1
fellow	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
a	1
THOROUGH	1
GOING	1
friend;	1
but	1
have	1
a	1
care,	1
or	1
you'll	1
get	1
yourself	1
and	1
me	1
into	1
some	1
scrape,	1
before	1
you	1
have	1
done	1
with	1
this	1
violent	1
THOROUGH	1
GOING	1
work.	1
Rory.	1
Never	1
fear!	1
never	1
fear,	1
man!--a	1
warm	1
frind	1
and	1
a	1
bitter	1
enemy,	1
that's	1
my	1
maxim.	1
Talb.	1
Yes,	1
but	1
too	1
warm	1
a	1
friend	1
is	1
as	1
bad	1
as	1
a	1
bitter	1
enemy.	1
Rory.	1
Oh,	1
never	1
fear	1
me!	1
I'm	1
as	1
cool	1
as	1
a	1
cucumber	1
all	1
the	1
time;	1
and	1
whilst	1
they	1
tink	1
I'm	1
tinking	1
of	1
nothing	1
in	1
life	1
but	1
making	1
a	1
noise,	1
I	1
make	1
my	1
own	1
snug	1
little	1
remarks	1
in	1
prose	1
and	1
verse,	1
as--now	1
my	1
voice	1
is	1
after	1
coming	1
back	1
to	1
me,	1
you	1
shall	1
hear,	1
if	1
you	1
plase.	1
Talb.	1
I	1
do	1
please.	1
Rory.	1
I	1
call	1
it	1
Rory's	1
song.	1
Now,	1
mind,	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
verse	1
for	1
everybody--	1
o'	1
the	1
leading	1
lads,	1
I	1
mean;	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
put	1
'em	1
in	1
or	1
lave	1
'em	1
out,	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
inclinations	1
and	1
deserts,	1
wise-a-wee	1
to	1
you,	1
my	1
little	1
frind.	1
So	1
you	1
comprehend	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
Rory's	1
song,	1
with	1
variations.	1
Talbot	1
and	1
Lord	1
John.	1
Let's	1
have	1
it;	1
let's	1
have	1
it	1
without	1
further	1
preface.	1
Rory	1
sings.	1
"I'm	1
true	1
game	1
to	1
the	1
last,	1
and	1
no	1
WHEELER	1
for	1
me."	1
Rory.	1
There's	1
a	1
stroke,	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
place,	1
for	1
Wheeler,--you	1
take	1
it?	1
Talb.	1
O	1
yes,	1
yes,	1
we	1
take	1
it;	1
go	1
on.	1
Rory	1
sings.	1
"I'm	1
true	1
game	1
to	1
the	1
last,	1
and	1
no	1
Wheeler	1
for	1
me.	1
Of	1
all	1
birds,	1
beasts,	1
or	1
fishes,	1
that	1
swim	1
in	1
the	1
sea,	1
Webb'd	1
or	1
finn'd,	1
black	1
or	1
white,	1
man	1
or	1
child,	1
Whig	1
or	1
Tory,	1
None	1
but	1
Talbot,	1
O,	1
Talbot's	1
the	1
dog	1
for	1
Rory."	1
Talb.	1
"Talbot	1
the	1
dog"	1
is	1
much	1
obliged	1
to	1
you.	1
Lord	1
J.	1
But	1
if	1
I	1
have	1
any	1
ear,	1
one	1
of	1
your	1
lines	1
is	1
a	1
foot	1
too	1
long,	1
Mr.	1
O'Ryan.	1
Rory.	1
Phoo,	1
put	1
the	1
best	1
foot	1
foremost	1
for	1
a	1
frind.	1
Slur	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
singing,	1
and	1
don't	1
be	1
quarrelling,	1
anyhow,	1
for	1
a	1
foot	1
more	1
or	1
less.	1
The	1
more	1
feet	1
the	1
better	1
it	1
will	1
stand,	1
you	1
know.	1
Only	1
let	1
me	1
go	1
on,	1
and	1
you'll	1
come	1
to	1
something	1
that	1
will	1
plase	1
you.	1
Rory	1
sings.	1
"Then	1
there's	1
he	1
with	1
the	1
purse	1
that's	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
my	1
arm."	1
Rory.	1
That's	1
Bursal,	1
mind	1
now,	1
whom	1
I	1
mean	1
to	1
allude	1
to	1
in	1
this	1
verse.	1
Lord	1
J.	1
If	1
the	1
allusion's	1
good,	1
we	1
shall	1
probably	1
find	1
out	1
your	1
meaning.	1
Talb.	1
On	1
with	1
you,	1
Rory,	1
and	1
don't	1
read	1
us	1
notes	1
on	1
a	1
song.	1
Lord	1
J.	1
Go	1
on,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
hear	1
what	1
you	1
say	1
of	1
Bursal.	1
Rory	1
sings.	1
"Then	1
there's	1
he	1
with	1
the	1
purse	1
that's	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
my	1
arm;	1
His	1
father's	1
a	1
tanner,--but	1
then	1
where's	1
the	1
harm?	1
Heir	1
to	1
houses,	1
and	1
hunters,	1
and	1
horseponds	1
in	1
fee,	1
Won't	1
his	1
skins	1
sure	1
soon	1
buy	1
him	1
a	1
pedigree?"	1
Lord	1
J.	1
Encore!	1
encore!	1
Why,	1
Rory,	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
you	1
could	1
make	1
so	1
good	1
a	1
song.	1
Rory.	1
Sure	1
'twas	1
none	1
of	1
I	1
made	1
it--'twas	1
Talbot	1
here.	1
Talb.	1
I!	1
Rory.	1
(aside).	1
Not	1
a	1
word:	1
I'll	1
make	1
you	1
a	1
present	1
of	1
it:	1
sure,	1
then,	1
it's	1
your	1
own.	1
Talb.	1
I	1
never	1
wrote	1
a	1
word	1
of	1
it.	1
Rory.	1
(to	1
Lord	1
J.).	1
Phoo,	1
Phoo!	1
he's	1
only	1
denying	1
it	1
out	1
of	1
false	1
modesty.	1
Lord.	1
J.	1
Well,	1
no	1
matter	1
who	1
wrote	1
it,--sing	1
it	1
again.	1
Rory.	1
Be	1
easy;	1
so	1
I	1
will,	1
and	1
as	1
many	1
more	1
verses	1
as	1
you	1
will	1
to	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
it.	1
(Winking	1
at	1
Talbot	1
aside.)	1
You	1
shall	1
have	1
the	1
credit	1
of	1
all.	1
(Aloud.)	1
Put	1
me	1
in	1
when	1
I'm	1
out,	1
Talbot,	1
and	1
you	1
(to	1
Lord	1
John)	1
join--join.	1
Rory	1
sings,	1
and	1
Lord	1
John	1
sings	1
with	1
him.	1
"Then	1
there's	1
he	1
with	1
the	1
purse	1
that's	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
my	1
arm;	1
His	1
father's	1
a	1
tanner,--but	1
then	1
where's	1
the	1
harm?	1
Heir	1
to	1
houses,	1
and	1
hunters,	1
and	1
horseponds	1
in	1
fee,	1
Won't	1
his	1
skins	1
sure	1
soon	1
buy	1
him	1
a	1
pedigree?	1
There's	1
my	1
lord	1
with	1
the	1
back	1
that	1
never	1
was	1
bent--"	1
(Lord	1
John	1
stops	1
singing;	1
Talbot	1
makes	1
signs	1
to	1
Rory	1
to	1
stop;	1
but	1
Rory	1
does	1
not	1
see	1
him,	1
and	1
sings	1
on.)	1
"There's	1
my	1
lord	1
with	1
the	1
back	1
that	1
never	1
was	1
bent;	1
Let	1
him	1
live	1
with	1
his	1
ancestors,	1
I	1
am	1
content."	1
(Rory	1
pushes	1
Lord	1
J.	1
and	1
Talbot	1
with	1
his	1
elbows.)	1
Rory.	1
Join,	1
join,	1
both	1
of	1
ye--why	1
don't	1
you	1
join?	1
(Sings.)	1
"Who'll	1
buy	1
my	1
Lord	1
John?	1
the	1
arch	1
fishwoman	1
cried,	1
A	1
nice	1
oyster	1
shut	1
up	1
in	1
a	1
choice	1
shell	1
of	1
pride."	1
Rory.	1
But	1
join	1
or	1
ye	1
spoil	1
all.	1
Talb.	1
You	1
have	1
spoiled	1
all,	1
indeed.	1
Lord	1
J.	1
(making	1
a	1
formal	1
low	1
bow).	1
Mr.	1
Talbot,	1
Lord	1
John	1
thanks	1
you.	1
Rory.	1
Lord	1
John!	1
blood	1
and	1
thunder!	1
I	1
forgot	1
you	1
were	1
by--quite	1
and	1
clean.	1
Lord	1
J.	1
(puts	1
him	1
aside	1
and	1
continues	1
speaking	1
to	1
Talbot).	1
Lord	1
John	1
thanks	1
you,	1
Mr.	1
Talbot:	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
second	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
caricature.	1
Lord	1
John	1
thanks	1
you	1
for	1
these	1
proofs	1
of	1
friendship--Lord	1
John	1
has	1
reason	1
to	1
thank	1
you,	1
Mr.	1
Talbot.	1
Rory.	1
No	1
reason	1
in	1
life	1
now.	1
Don't	1
be	1
thanking	1
so	1
much	1
for	1
nothing	1
in	1
life;	1
or	1
if	1
you	1
must	1
be	1
thanking	1
of	1
somebody,	1
it's	1
me	1
you	1
ought	1
to	1
thank.	1
Lord	1
J.	1
I	1
ought	1
and	1
do,	1
sir,	1
for	1
unmasking	1
one	1
who--	1
Talb.	1
(warmly).	1
Unmasking,	1
my	1
lord--	1
Rory	1
(holding	1
them	1
asunder).	1
Phoo!	1
phoo!	1
phoo!	1
be	1
easy,	1
can't	1
ye?--	1
there's	1
no	1
unmasking	1
at	1
all	1
in	1
the	1
case.	1
My	1
Lord	1
John,	1
Talbot's	1
writing	1
the	1
song	1
was	1
all	1
a	1
mistake.	1
Lord	1
J.	1
As	1
much	1
a	1
mistake	1
as	1
your	1
singing	1
it,	1
sir,	1
I	1
presume--	1
Rory.	1
Just	1
as	1
much.	1
'Twas	1
all	1
a	1
mistake.	1
So	1
now	1
don't	1
you	1
go	1
and	1
make	1
a	1
mistake	1
into	1
a	1
misunderstanding.	1
It	1
was	1
I	1
made	1
every	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
song	1
out	1
o'	1
the	1
face*--that	1
about	1
the	1
back	1
that	1
never	1
was	1
bent,	1
and	1
the	1
ancestors	1
of	1
the	1
oyster,	1
and	1
all.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
waste	1
a	1
word	1
of	1
it;	1
upon	1
my	1
conscience,	1
I	1
wrote	1
it	1
all--though	1
I'll	1
engage	1
you	1
didn't	1
think	1
I	1
could	1
write	1
a	1
good	1
thing.	1
(Lord	1
John	1
turns	1
away.)	1
I'm	1
telling	1
you	1
the	1
truth,	1
and	1
not	1
a	1
word	1
of	1
a	1
lie,	1
and	1
yet	1
you	1
won't	1
believe	1
me.	1
*From	1
beginning	1
to	1
end.	1
Lord	1
J.	1
You	1
will	1
excuse	1
me,	1
sir,	1
if	1
I	1
cannot	1
believe	1
two	1
contradictory	1
assertions	1
within	1
two	1
minutes.	1
Mr.	1
Talbot,	1
I	1
thank	1
you	1
(going).	1
(Rory	1
tries	1
to	1
stop	1
Lord	1
John	1
from	1
going,	1
but	1
cannot.--Exit	1
Lord	1
John.)	1
Rory.	1
Well,	1
if	1
he	1
WILL	1
go,	1
let	1
him	1
go	1
then,	1
and	1
much	1
good	1
may	1
it	1
do	1
him.	1
Nay,	1
but	1
don't	1
you	1
go	1
too.	1
Talb.	1
O	1
Rory,	1
what	1
have	1
you	1
done?--(Talbot	1
runs	1
after	1
Lord	1
J.)	1
Hear	1
me,	1
my	1
lord.	1
(Exit	1
Talbot.)	1
Rory.	1
Hear	1
him!	1
hear	1
him!	1
hear	1
him!--Well,	1
I'm	1
point	1
blank	1
mad	1
with	1
myself	1
for	1
making	1
this	1
blunder;	1
but	1
how	1
could	1
I	1
help	1
it?	1
As	1
sure	1
as	1
ever	1
I	1
am	1
meaning	1
to	1
do	1
the	1
best	1
thing	1
on	1
earth,	1
it	1
turns	1
out	1
the	1
worst.	1
Enter	1
a	1
party	1
of	1
lads,	1
huzzaing.	1
Rory	1
(joins.)	1
Huzza!	1
huzza!--Who,	1
pray,	1
are	1
ye	1
huzzaing	1
for?	1
1st	1
Boy.	1
Wheeler!	1
Wheeler	1
for	1
ever!	1
huzza!	1
Rory.	1
Talbot!	1
Talbot	1
for	1
ever!	1
huzza!	1
Captain	1
Talbot	1
for	1
ever!	1
huzza!	1
2nd	1
Boy.	1
CAPTAIN	1
he'll	1
never	1
be,--at	1
least	1
not	1
to-morrow;	1
for	1
Lord	1
John	1
has	1
just	1
declared	1
for	1
Wheeler.	1
lst	1
Boy.	1
And	1
that	1
turns	1
the	1
scale.	1
Rory.	1
Oh,	1
the	1
scale	1
may	1
turn	1
back	1
again.	1
3rd	1
Boy.	1
Impossible!	1
Lord	1
John	1
has	1
just	1
given	1
his	1
promise	1
to	1
Wheeler.	1
I	1
heard	1
him	1
with	1
my	1
own	1
ears.	1
(Several	1
speak	1
at	1
once.)	1
And	1
I	1
heard	1
him;	1
and	1
I!	1
and	1
I!	1
and	1
I!--Huzza!	1
Wheeler	1
for	1
ever!	1
Rory.	1
Oh,	1
murder!	1
murder!	1
murder!	1
(Aside.)	1
This	1
goes	1
to	1
my	1
heart!	1
it's	1
all	1
my	1
doing.	1
O,	1
my	1
poor	1
Talbot!--	1
murder!	1
murder!	1
murder!	1
But	1
I	1
won't	1
let	1
them	1
see	1
me	1
cast	1
down,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
good	1
to	1
be	1
huzzaing	1
at	1
all	1
events.	1
Huzza	1
for	1
Talbot!	1
Talbot	1
for	1
ever!	1
huzza!	1
(Exit.)	1
Enter	1
WHEELER	1
and	1
BURSAL.	1
Wheel.	1
Who	1
was	1
that	1
huzzaing	1
for	1
Talbot?	1
(Rory	1
behind	1
the	1
scenes,	1
"Huzza	1
for	1
Talbot!	1
Talbot	1
for	1
ever!	1
huzza!")	1
Burs.	1
Pooh,	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
Rory	1
O'Ryan,	1
or	1
the	1
roaring	1
lion	1
as	1
I	1
call	1
him.	1
Ha!	1
ha!	1
ha!	1
Rory	1
O'Ryan,	1
alias	1
O'Ryan,	1
the	1
roaring	1
lion;	1
that's	1
a	1
good	1
one;	1
put	1
it	1
about--Rory	1
O'Ryan,	1
the	1
roaring	1
lion,	1
ha!	1
ha!	1
ha!	1
but	1
you	1
don't	1
take	1
it--you	1
don't	1
laugh,	1
Wheeler.	1
Wheeler.	1
Ha!	1
ha!	1
ha!	1
O,	1
upon	1
my	1
honour	1
I	1
do	1
laugh;	1
ha!	1
ha!	1
ha!	1
(Aside).	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
hardest	1
work	1
to	1
laugh	1
at	1
his	1
wit.	1
(Aloud.)	1
Rory	1
O'Ryan,	1
the	1
roaring	1
lion--ha!	1
ha!	1
ha!	1
You	1
know	1
I	1
always	1
laugh,	1
Bursal,	1
at	1
your	1
jokes--he!	1
he!	1
he!--ready	1
to	1
kill	1
myself.	1
Burs.	1
(sullenly).	1
You	1
are	1
easily	1
killed,	1
then,	1
if	1
that	1
much	1
laughing	1
will	1
do	1
the	1
business.	1
Wheel.	1
(coughing).	1
Just	1
then--something	1
stuck	1
in	1
my	1
throat;	1
I	1
beg	1
your	1
pardon.	1
Burs.	1
(still	1
sullen).	1
Oh,	1
you	1
need	1
not	1
beg	1
my	1
pardon	1
about	1
the	1
matter.	1
I	1
don't	1
care	1
whether	1
you	1
laugh	1
or	1
no--not	1
I.	1
Now	1
you	1
have	1
got	1
Lord	1
John	1
to	1
declare	1
for	1
you,	1
you	1
are	1
above	1
laughing	1
at	1
my	1
jokes,	1
I	1
suppose.	1
Wheel.	1
No,	1
upon	1
my	1
word	1
and	1
honour,	1
I	1
DID	1
laugh.	1
Burs.	1
(aside).	1
A	1
fig	1
for	1
your	1
word	1
and	1
honour.	1
(Aloud.)	1
I	1
know	1
I'm	1
of	1
no	1
consequence	1
now;	1
but	1
you'll	1
remember,	1
that	1
if	1
his	1
lordship	1
has	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
making	1
you	1
captain,	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
the	1
honour	1
to	1
pay	1
for	1
your	1
captain's	1
accoutrements;	1
for	1
I	1
sha'n't	1
pay	1
the	1
piper,	1
I	1
promise	1
you,	1
since	1
I'm	1
of	1
no	1
consequence.	1
Wheel.	1
Of	1
no	1
consequence!	1
But,	1
my	1
dear	1
Bursal,	1
what	1
could	1
put	1
that	1
into	1
your	1
head?	1
that's	1
the	1
strangest,	1
oddest	1
fancy.	1
Of	1
no	1
consequence!	1
Bursal,	1
of	1
no	1
consequence!	1
Why,	1
everybody	1
that	1
knows	1
anything--everybody	1
that	1
has	1
seen	1
Bursal	1
House--knows	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
of	1
the	1
greatest	1
consequence,	1
my	1
dear	1
Bursal.	1
Burs.	1
(taking	1
out	1
his	1
watch,	1
and	1
opening	1
it,	1
looks	1
at	1
it).	1
No,	1
I'm	1
of	1
no	1
consequence.	1
I	1
wonder	1
that	1
rascal	1
Finsbury	1
is	1
not	1
come	1
yet	1
with	1
the	1
dresses	1
(still	1
looking	1
at	1
his	1
watch).	1
Wheel.	1
(aside).	1
If	1
Bursal	1
takes	1
it	1
into	1
his	1
head	1
not	1
to	1
lend	1
me	1
the	1
money	1
to	1
pay	1
for	1
my	1
captain's	1
dress,	1
what	1
will	1
become	1
of	1
me?	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
a	1
shilling--and	1
Lord	1
John	1
won't	1
pay	1
for	1
me--and	1
Finsbury	1
has	1
orders	1
not	1
to	1
leave	1
the	1
house	1
till	1
he	1
is	1
paid	1
by	1
everybody.	1
What	1
will	1
become	1
of	1
me?--(bites	1
his	1
nails).	1
Burs.	1
(aside).	1
How	1
I	1
love	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
bite	1
his	1
nails!	1
(Aloud.)	1
I	1
know	1
I'm	1
of	1
no	1
consequence.	1
(Strikes	1
his	1
repeater.)	1
Wheel.	1
What	1
a	1
fine	1
repeater	1
that	1
is	1
of	1
yours,	1
Bursal!	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
best	1
I	1
ever	1
heard.	1
Burs.	1
So	1
it	1
well	1
may	1
be;	1
for	1
it	1
cost	1
a	1
mint	1
of	1
money.	1
Wheel.	1
No	1
matter	1
to	1
you	1
what	1
anything	1
costs.	1
Happy	1
dog	1
as	1
you	1
are!	1
You	1
roll	1
in	1
money;	1
and	1
yet	1
you	1
talk	1
of	1
being	1
of	1
no	1
consequence.	1
Burs.	1
But	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
of	1
half	1
so	1
much	1
consequence	1
as	1
Lord	1
John--am	1
I?	1
Wheel.	1
Are	1
you?	1
Why,	1
aren't	1
you	1
twice	1
as	1
rich	1
as	1
he!	1
Burs.	1
Very	1
true,	1
but	1
I'm	1
not	1
purse-proud.	1
Wheel.	1
You	1
purse-proud!	1
I	1
should	1
never	1
have	1
thought	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
thing.	1
Burs.	1
Nor	1
I,	1
if	1
Talbot	1
had	1
not	1
used	1
the	1
word.	1
Wheel.	1
But	1
Talbot	1
thinks	1
everybody	1
purse-proud	1
that	1
has	1
a	1
purse.	1
Burs.	1
(aside).	1
Well,	1
this	1
Wheeler	1
does	1
put	1
one	1
into	1
a	1
good	1
humour	1
with	1
one's	1
self	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
one's	1
teeth.	1
(Aloud.)	1
Talbot	1
says	1
blunt	1
things;	1
but	1
I	1
don't	1
think	1
he's	1
what	1
you	1
can	1
call	1
clever--hey,	1
Wheeler?	1
Wheel.	1
Clever?	1
Oh,	1
not	1
he.	1
Burs.	1
I	1
think	1
I	1
could	1
walk	1
round	1
him.	1
Wheel.	1
To	1
be	1
sure	1
you	1
could.	1
Why,	1
do	1
you	1
know,	1
I've	1
quizzed	1
him	1
famously	1
myself	1
within	1
this	1
quarter	1
of	1
an	1
hour!	1
Burs.	1
Indeed!	1
I	1
wish	1
I	1
had	1
been	1
by.	1
Wheel.	1
So	1
do	1
I,	1
'faith!	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
best	1
thing.	1
I	1
wanted,	1
you	1
see,	1
to	1
get	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
way,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
have	1
the	1
field	1
clear	1
for	1
electioneering	1
to-day.	1
So	1
I	1
bowls	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
long	1
face--such	1
a	1
face	1
as	1
this.	1
Mr.	1
Talbot,	1
do	1
you	1
know--I'm	1
sorry	1
to	1
tell	1
you,	1
here's	1
Jack	1
Smith	1
has	1
just	1
brought	1
the	1
news	1
from	1
Salt	1
Hill.	1
Your	1
mother,	1
in	1
getting	1
into	1
the	1
carriage,	1
slipped,	1
and	1
has	1
BROKE	1
her	1
leg,	1
and	1
there	1
she's	1
lying	1
at	1
a	1
farmhouse,	1
two	1
miles	1
off.	1
Is	1
not	1
it	1
true,	1
Jack?	1
said	1
I.	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
farmer	1
helping	1
her	1
in	1
with	1
my	1
own	1
eyes,	1
cries	1
Jack.	1
Off	1
goes	1
Talbot	1
like	1
an	1
arrow.	1
Quizzed	1
him,	1
quizzed	1
him!	1
said	1
I.	1
Burs.	1
Ha!	1
ha!	1
ha!	1
quizzed	1
him	1
indeed,	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
cleverness;	1
that	1
was	1
famously	1
done.	1
Wheel.	1
Ha!	1
ha!	1
ha!	1
With	1
all	1
his	1
cleverness	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
all	1
the	1
evening	1
hunting	1
for	1
the	1
farmhouse	1
and	1
the	1
mother	1
that	1
has	1
broke	1
her	1
leg;	1
so	1
he	1
is	1
out	1
of	1
our	1
way.	1
Burs.	1
But	1
what	1
need	1
have	1
you	1
to	1
want	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
your	1
way,	1
now	1
Lord	1
John	1
has	1
come	1
over	1
to	1
your	1
side?	1
You	1
have	1
the	1
thing	1
at	1
a	1
dead	1
beat.	1
Wheel.	1
Not	1
so	1
dead	1
either;	1
for	1
there's	1
a	1
great	1
independent	1
party,	1
you	1
know;	1
and	1
if	1
YOU	1
don't	1
help	1
me,	1
Bursal,	1
to	1
canvass	1
them,	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
captain.	1
It	1
is	1
you	1
I	1
depend	1
upon	1
after	1
all.	1
Will	1
you	1
come	1
and	1
canvass	1
them	1
with	1
me?	1
Dear	1
Bursal,	1
pray--all	1
depends	1
upon	1
you.	1
(Pulls	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
arm--Bursal	1
follows.)	1
Burs.	1
Well,	1
if	1
all	1
depends	1
upon	1
me,	1
I'll	1
see	1
what	1
I	1
can	1
do	1
for	1
you.	1
(Aside.)	1
Then	1
I	1
am	1
of	1
some	1
consequence!	1
Money	1
makes	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
some	1
consequence,	1
I	1
see;	1
at	1
least	1
with	1
some	1
folks.	1
SCENE	1
II.	1
In	1
the	1
back	1
scene	1
a	1
flock	1
of	1
sheep	1
are	1
seen	1
penned.	1
In	1
front,	1
a	1
party	1
of	1
country	1
lads	1
and	1
lasses,	1
gaily	1
dressed,	1
as	1
in	1
sheep-shearing	1
time,	1
with	1
ribands	1
and	1
garlands	1
of	1
flowers,	1
etc.,	1
are	1
dancing	1
and	1
singing.	1
Enter	1
PATTY,	1
dressed	1
as	1
the	1
Queen	1
of	1
the	1
Festival,	1
with	1
a	1
lamb	1
in	1
her	1
arms.	1
The	1
dancers	1
break	1
off	1
when	1
she	1
comes	1
in,	1
and	1
direct	1
their	1
attention	1
towards	1
her.	1
1st	1
Peasant.	1
Oh,	1
here	1
comes	1
Patty!	1
Here	1
comes	1
the	1
Queen	1
o'	1
the	1
day.	1
What	1
has	1
kept	1
you	1
from	1
us	1
so	1
long,	1
Patty?	1
2nd	1
Peasant.	1
"Please	1
your	1
Majesty,"	1
you	1
should	1
say.	1
Patty.	1
This	1
poor	1
little	1
lamb	1
of	1
mine	1
was	1
what	1
kept	1
me	1
so	1
long.	1
It	1
strayed	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
rest;	1
and	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
lost	1
him,	1
so	1
I	1
should,	1
for	1
ever,	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
for	1
a	1
good	1
young	1
gentleman.	1
Yonder	1
he	1
is,	1
talking	1
to	1
Farmer	1
Hearty.	1
That's	1
the	1
young	1
gentleman	1
who	1
pulled	1
my	1
lamb	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
ditch	1
for	1
me,	1
into	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
fallen--pretty	1
creature!	1
1st	1
Peasant.	1
Pretty	1
creature--or,	1
your	1
Majesty,	1
whichever	1
you	1
choose	1
to	1
be	1
called--come	1
and	1
dance	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
I'll	1
carry	1
your	1
lamb.	1
(Exeunt,	1
singing	1
and	1
dancing.)	1
Enter	1
FARMER	1
HEARTY	1
and	1
TALBOT.	1
Farmer.	1
Why,	1
young	1
gentleman,	1
I'm	1
glad	1
I	1
happened	1
to	1
light	1
upon	1
you	1
here,	1
and	1
so	1
to	1
hinder	1
you	1
from	1
going	1
farther	1
astray,	1
and	1
set	1
your	1
heart	1
at	1
ease	1
like.	1
Talb.	1
Thanks,	1
good	1
farmer,	1
you	1
have	1
set	1
my	1
heart	1
at	1
ease,	1
indeed.	1
But	1
the	1
truth	1
is,	1
they	1
did	1
frighten	1
me	1
confoundedly--more	1
fool	1
I.	1
Farm.	1
No	1
fool	1
at	1
all,	1
to	1
my	1
notion.	1
I	1
should,	1
at	1
your	1
age,	1
ay,	1
or	1
at	1
my	1
age,	1
just	1
the	1
self-same	1
way	1
have	1
been	1
frightened	1
myself,	1
if	1
so	1
be	1
that	1
mention	1
had	1
been	1
made	1
to	1
me,	1
that	1
way,	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
mother's	1
having	1
broke	1
her	1
leg	1
or	1
so.	1
And	1
greater,	1
by	1
a	1
great	1
deal,	1
the	1
shame	1
for	1
them	1
that	1
frighted	1
you,	1
than	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
frighted.	1
How	1
young	1
gentlemen,	1
now,	1
can	1
bring	1
themselves	1
for	1
to	1
tell	1
such	1
lies,	1
is	1
to	1
me,	1
now,	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
amazement,	1
like,	1
that	1
I	1
can't	1
noways	1
get	1
over.	1
Talb.	1
Oh,	1
farmer,	1
such	1
lies	1
are	1
very	1
witty,	1
though	1
you	1
and	1
I	1
don't	1
just	1
now	1
like	1
the	1
wit	1
of	1
them.	1
This	1
is	1
fun,	1
this	1
is	1
quizzing;	1
but	1
you	1
don't	1
know	1
what	1
we	1
young	1
gentlemen	1
mean	1
by	1
quizzing.	1
Farm.	1
Ay,	1
but	1
I	1
do	1
though,	1
to	1
my	1
cost,	1
ever	1
since	1
last	1
year.	1
Look	1
you,	1
now,	1
at	1
yon	1
fine	1
field	1
of	1
wheat.	1
Well,	1
it	1
was	1
just	1
as	1
fine,	1
and	1
finer,	1
last	1
year,	1
till	1
a	1
young	1
Eton	1
jackanapes--	1
Talb.	1
Take	1
care	1
what	1
you	1
say,	1
farmer;	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
young	1
Eton	1
jackanapes.	1
Farm.	1
No;	1
but	1
you	1
be	1
not	1
the	1
young	1
Eton	1
jackanapes	1
that	1
I'm	1
a-thinking	1
on.	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
it	1
was	1
this	1
time	1
last	1
year,	1
man;	1
he	1
was	1
a-horseback,	1
I	1
tell	1
ye,	1
mounted	1
upon	1
a	1
fine	1
bay	1
hunter,	1
out	1
a-hunting,	1
like.	1
Talb.	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
it	1
was	1
this	1
time	1
last	1
year,	1
man,	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
mounted	1
upon	1
a	1
fine	1
bay	1
hunter,	1
out	1
a-hunting.	1
Farm.	1
Zooks!	1
would	1
you	1
argufy	1
a	1
man	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
wits?	1
You	1
won't	1
go	1
for	1
to	1
tell	1
me	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
that	1
impertinent	1
little	1
jackanapes!	1
Talb.	1
No!	1
no!	1
I'll	1
not	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
an	1
impertinent	1
little	1
jackanapes!	1
Farm	1
(wiping	1
his	1
forehead).	1
Well,	1
don't	1
then,	1
for	1
I	1
can't	1
believe	1
it;	1
and	1
you	1
put	1
me	1
out.	1
Where	1
was	1
I?	1
Talb.	1
Mounted	1
upon	1
a	1
fine	1
bay	1
hunter.	1
Farm.	1
Ay,	1
so	1
he	1
was.	1
"Here,	1
YOU,"	1
says	1
he,	1
meaning	1
me--"open	1
this	1
gate	1
for	1
me."	1
Now,	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
but	1
a-spoke	1
me	1
fair,	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
gainsaid	1
him:	1
but	1
he	1
falls	1
to	1
swearing,	1
so	1
I	1
bid	1
him	1
open	1
the	1
gate	1
for	1
himself.	1
"There's	1
a	1
bull	1
behind	1
you,	1
farmer,"	1
says	1
he.	1
I	1
turns.	1
"Quizzed	1
him!"	1
cries	1
my	1
jackanapes,	1
and	1
off	1
he	1
gallops	1
him,	1
through	1
the	1
very	1
thick	1
of	1
my	1
corn;	1
but	1
he	1
got	1
a	1
fall,	1
leaping	1
the	1
ditch	1
out	1
yonder,	1
which	1
pacified	1
me,	1
like,	1
at	1
the	1
minute.	1
So	1
I	1
goes	1
up	1
to	1
see	1
whether	1
he	1
was	1
killed;	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
whit	1
the	1
worse	1
for	1
his	1
tumble.	1
So	1
I	1
should	1
ha'	1
fell	1
into	1
a	1
passion	1
with	1
him	1
then,	1
to	1
be	1
sure,	1
about	1
my	1
corn;	1
but	1
his	1
horse	1
had	1
got	1
such	1
a	1
terrible	1
sprain,	1
I	1
couldn't	1
say	1
anything	1
to	1
him;	1
for	1
I	1
was	1
a-	1
pitying	1
the	1
poor	1
animal.	1
As	1
fine	1
a	1
hunter	1
as	1
ever	1
you	1
saw!	1
I	1
am	1
sartain	1
sure	1
he	1
could	1
never	1
come	1
to	1
good	1
after.	1
Talb.	1
(aside).	1
I	1
do	1
think,	1
from	1
the	1
description,	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
Wheeler;	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
paid	1
for	1
the	1
horse	1
which	1
he	1
spoiled!	1
(Aloud.)	1
Should	1
you	1
know	1
either	1
the	1
man	1
or	1
the	1
horse	1
again,	1
if	1
you	1
were	1
to	1
see	1
them?	1
Farm.	1
Ay,	1
that	1
I	1
should,	1
to	1
my	1
dying	1
day.	1
Talb.	1
Will	1
you	1
come	1
with	1
me,	1
then,	1
and	1
you'll	1
do	1
me	1
some	1
guineas'	1
worth	1
of	1
service?	1
Farm.	1
Ay,	1
that	1
I	1
will,	1
with	1
a	1
deal	1
of	1
pleasure;	1
for	1
you	1
be	1
a	1
civil	1
spoken	1
young	1
gentleman;	1
and,	1
besides,	1
I	1
don't	1
think	1
the	1
worse	1
on	1
you	1
for	1
being	1
FRIGHTED	1
a	1
little	1
about	1
your	1
mother;	1
being	1
what	1
I	1
might	1
ha'	1
been,	1
at	1
your	1
age,	1
myself;	1
for	1
I	1
had	1
a	1
mother	1
myself	1
once.	1
So	1
lead	1
on,	1
master.	1
(Exeunt.)	1

THE	1
THIRD.	1
SCENE	1
I.	1
The	1
garden	1
of	1
the	1
"Windmill	1
Inn,"	1
at	1
Salt	1
Hill.	1
MISS	1
BURSAL,	1
MRS.	1
NEWINGTON,	1
SALLY,	1
the	1
Chambermaid.	1
(Miss	1
Bursal,	1
in	1
a	1
fainting	1
state,	1
is	1
sitting	1
on	1
a	1
garden	1
stool,	1
and	1
leaning	1
her	1
head	1
against	1
the	1
Landlady.	1
Sally	1
is	1
holding	1
a	1
glass	1
of	1
water	1
and	1
a	1
smelling	1
bottle.)	1
Miss	1
Bursal.	1
Where	1
am	1
I?	1
Where	1
am	1
I?	1
Landlady.	1
At	1
the	1
"Windmill,"	1
at	1
Salt	1
Hill,	1
young	1
lady;	1
and	1
ill	1
or	1
well,	1
you	1
can't	1
be	1
better.	1
Sally.	1
Do	1
you	1
find	1
yourself	1
better	1
since	1
coming	1
into	1
the	1
air,	1
miss?	1
Miss	1
B.	1
Better!	1
Oh,	1
I	1
shall	1
never	1
be	1
better!	1
(Leans	1
her	1
head	1
on	1
hand,	1
and	1
rocks	1
herself	1
backwards	1
and	1
forwards.)	1
Landlady.	1
My	1
dear	1
young	1
lady,	1
don't	1
take	1
on	1
so.	1
(Aside.)	1
Now	1
would	1
I	1
give	1
something	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
my	1
Lady	1
Piercefield	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
father,	1
and	1
what	1
the	1
father	1
said	1
to	1
this	1
one,	1
and	1
what's	1
the	1
matter	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
affairs.	1
Sally,	1
did	1
you	1
hear	1
anything	1
at	1
the	1
doors?	1
Sally	1
(aside).	1
No,	1
indeed,	1
ma'am;	1
I	1
never	1
BE'S	1
at	1
the	1
doors.	1
Landlady	1
(aside).	1
Simpleton!	1
(Aloud.)	1
But,	1
my	1
dear	1
Miss	1
Bursal,	1
if	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
so	1
bold--if	1
you'd	1
only	1
disembosom	1
your	1
mind	1
of	1
what's	1
on	1
it--	1
Miss	1
B.	1
Disembosom	1
my	1
mind!	1
Nonsense!	1
I've	1
nothing	1
on	1
my	1
mind.	1
Pray	1
leave	1
me,	1
madam.	1
Landlady	1
(aside).	1
Madam,	1
indeed!	1
madam,	1
forsooth!	1
Oh,	1
I'll	1
make	1
her	1
pay	1
for	1
that!	1
That	1
MADAM	1
shall	1
go	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
bill,	1
as	1
sure	1
as	1
my	1
name's	1
Newington.	1
(Landlady,	1
in	1
a	1
higher	1
tone.)	1
Well,	1
I	1
wish	1
you	1
better,	1
ma'am.	1
I	1
suppose	1
I'd	1
best	1
send	1
your	1
own	1
servant?	1
Miss	1
B.	1
(sullenly).	1
Yes,	1
I	1
suppose	1
so.	1
(To	1
Sally.)	1
You	1
need	1
not	1
wait,	1
child,	1
nor	1
look	1
so	1
curious.	1
Sally.	1
CUR'OUS!	1
Indeed,	1
miss,	1
if	1
I	1
look	1
a	1
little	1
CUR'OUS,	1
or	1
so	1
(looking	1
at	1
her	1
dress),	1
'tis	1
only	1
because	1
I	1
was	1
FRIGHTED	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
take	1
on,	1
which	1
made	1
me	1
forget	1
my	1
clean	1
apron,	1
when	1
I	1
came	1
out;	1
and	1
this	1
apron-	1
-	1
Miss	1
B.	1
Hush!	1
Hush!	1
child.	1
Don't	1
tell	1
me	1
about	1
clean	1
aprons,	1
nor	1
run	1
on	1
with	1
your	1
vulgar	1
talk.	1
Is	1
there	1
ever	1
a	1
seat	1
one	1
can	1
set	1
on	1
in	1
that	1
_H_arbour	1
yonder?	1
Sally.	1
O	1
dear	1
'ART,	1
yes,	1
miss;	1
'tis	1
the	1
pleasantest	1
_H_arbour	1
on	1
_H_earth.	1
Be	1
pleased	1
to	1
lean	1
on	1
my	1
_H_arm,	1
and	1
you'll	1
soon	1
be	1
there.	1
Miss	1
B.	1
(going).	1
Then	1
tell	1
my	1
woman	1
she	1
need	1
not	1
come	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
let	1
nobody	1
INTERUDE	1
on	1
me--do	1
you	1
'EAR?	1
(Aside.)	1
Oh,	1
what	1
will	1
become	1
of	1
me?	1
and	1
the	1
Talbots	1
will	1
soon	1
know	1
it!	1
And	1
the	1
ponies,	1
and	1
the	1
curricle,	1
and	1
the	1
vis-a-vis--what	1
will	1
become	1
of	1
them?	1
and	1
how	1
shall	1
I	1
make	1
my	1
appearance	1
at	1
the	1
Montem,	1
or	1
any	1
WARE	1
else?	1
SCENE	1
II.	1
LORD	1
JOHN--WHEELER--BURSAL.	1
Wheeler.	1
Well,	1
but	1
my	1
lord--Well,	1
but	1
Bursal--though	1
my	1
Lady	1
Piercefield--though	1
Miss	1
Bursal	1
is	1
come	1
to	1
Salt	1
Hill,	1
you	1
won't	1
leave	1
us	1
all	1
at	1
sixes	1
and	1
sevens.	1
What	1
can	1
we	1
do	1
without	1
you?	1
Lord	1
J.	1
You	1
can	1
do	1
very	1
well	1
without	1
me.	1
Bursal.	1
You	1
can	1
do	1
very	1
well	1
without	1
me.	1
Wheel.	1
(to	1
Burs.).	1
Impossible!--impossible!	1
You	1
know	1
Mr.	1
Finsbury	1
will	1
be	1
here	1
just	1
now,	1
with	1
the	1
dresses;	1
and	1
we	1
have	1
to	1
try	1
them	1
on.	1
Burs.	1
And	1
to	1
pay	1
for	1
them.	1
Wheel.	1
And	1
to	1
settle	1
about	1
the	1
procession.	1
And	1
then,	1
my	1
lord,	1
the	1
election	1
is	1
to	1
come	1
on	1
this	1
evening.	1
You	1
won't	1
go	1
till	1
that's	1
over,	1
as	1
your	1
lordship	1
has	1
PROMISED	1
me	1
your	1
lordship's	1
vote	1
and	1
interest.	1
Lord	1
J.	1
My	1
vote	1
I	1
promised	1
you,	1
Mr.	1
Wheeler;	1
but	1
I	1
said	1
not	1
a	1
syllable	1
about	1
my	1
INTEREST.	1
My	1
friends,	1
perhaps,	1
have	1
not	1
been	1
offended,	1
though	1
I	1
have,	1
by	1
Mr.	1
Talbot.	1
I	1
shall	1
leave	1
them	1
to	1
their	1
own	1
inclinations.	1
Burs.	1
(whistling).	1
Wheugh!	1
wheugh!	1
wheugh!	1
Wheeler,	1
the	1
principal's	1
nothing	1
without	1
the	1
interest.	1
Wheel.	1
Oh,	1
the	1
interest	1
will	1
go	1
along	1
with	1
the	1
principal,	1
of	1
course;	1
for	1
I'm	1
persuaded,	1
if	1
my	1
lord	1
leaves	1
his	1
friends	1
to	1
their	1
inclinations,	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
inclination	1
of	1
my	1
lord's	1
friends	1
to	1
vote	1
as	1
he	1
does,	1
if	1
he	1
says	1
nothing	1
to	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
contrary.	1
Lord	1
J.	1
I	1
told	1
you,	1
Mr.	1
Wheeler,	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
leave	1
them	1
to	1
themselves.	1
Burs.	1
(still	1
whistling).	1
Well,	1
I'll	1
do	1
my	1
best	1
to	1
make	1
that	1
father	1
of	1
mine	1
send	1
me	1
off	1
to	1
Oxford.	1
I'm	1
sure	1
I'm	1
fit	1
to	1
go--along	1
with	1
Wheeler.	1
Why,	1
you'd	1
best	1
be	1
my	1
tutor,	1
Wheeler!--a	1
devilish	1
good	1
thought.	1
Wheel.	1
An	1
excellent	1
thought.	1
Burs.	1
And	1
a	1
cursed	1
fine	1
dust	1
we	1
should	1
kick	1
up	1
at	1
Oxford,	1
with	1
your	1
Montem	1
money	1
and	1
all!--Money's	1
THE	1
GO	1
after	1
all.	1
I	1
wish	1
it	1
was	1
come	1
to	1
my	1
making	1
you	1
my	1
last	1
bow,	1
"ye	1
distant	1
spires,	1
ye	1
ANTIC	1
towers!"	1
Wheel.	1
(aside	1
to	1
Lord	1
J.).	1
Ye	1
ANTIC	1
towers!--fit	1
for	1
Oxford,	1
my	1
lord!	1
Lord	1
J.	1
Antique	1
towers,	1
I	1
suppose	1
Mr.	1
Bursal	1
means.	1
Burs.	1
Antique,	1
to	1
be	1
sure!--I	1
said	1
antique,	1
did	1
not	1
I,	1
Wheeler?	1
Wheel.	1
O,	1
yes.	1
Lord	1
J.	1
(aside).	1
What	1
a	1
mean	1
animal	1
is	1
this!	1
Enter	1
RORY	1
O'RYAN.	1
Rory.	1
Why,	1
now,	1
what's	1
become	1
of	1
Talbot,	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
know?	1
There	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
anywhere	1
in	1
the	1
wide	1
world;	1
and	1
there's	1
a	1
hullabaloo	1
amongst	1
his	1
friends	1
for	1
him.	1
(Wheeler	1
and	1
Bursal	1
wink	1
at	1
one	1
another.)	1
Wheel.	1
We	1
know	1
nothing	1
of	1
him.	1
Lord	1
J.	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
the	1
honour,	1
sir,	1
to	1
be	1
one	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Talbot's	1

It	1
is	1
his	1
own	1
fault,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
sorry	1
for	1
it.	1
Rory.	1
'Faith,	1
so	1
am	1
I,	1
especially	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
mine--fault	1
I	1
mean;	1
and	1
especially	1
as	1
the	1
election	1
is	1
just	1
going	1
to	1
come	1
on.	1
Enter	1
a	1
party	1
of	1
boys,	1
who	1
cry,	1
Finsbury's	1
come!--Finsbury's	1
come	1
with	1
the	1
dresses!	1
Wheel.	1
Finsbury's	1
come?	1
Oh,	1
let	1
us	1
see	1
the	1
dresses,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
try	1
'em	1
on	1
to-night.	1
Burs.	1
(pushing	1
the	1
crowd).	1
On	1
with	1
ye--on	1
with	1
ye,	1
there!--Let's	1
try	1
'em	1
on!--Try	1
'em	1
on--I'm	1
to	1
be	1
colonel.	1
lst	1
Boy.	1
And	1
I	1
lieutenant.	1
2nd	1
Boy.	1
And	1
I	1
ensign.	1
3rd	1

And	1
I	1
college	1
salt-bearer.	1
4th	1

And	1
I	1
oppidan.	1
5th	1
Boy.	1
Oh,	1
what	1
a	1
pity	1
I'm	1
in	1
mourning.	1
Several	1
speak	1
at	1
once.	1
And	1
we	1
are	1
servitors.	1
We	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
eight	1
servitors.	1
Wheel.	1
And	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
be	1
your	1
Captain,	1
I	1
hope.	1
Come	1
on,	1
my	1
Colonel.	1
(To	1
Bursal).	1
My	1
lord,	1
you	1
are	1
coming?	1
Rory.	1
By-and-by--I've	1
a	1
word	1
in	1
his	1
ear,	1
by	1
your	1
LAVE	1
and	1
his.	1
Burs.	1
Why,	1
what	1
the	1
devil	1
stops	1
the	1
way,	1
there?--Push	1
on--on	1
with	1
them.	1
6th	1
Boy.	1
I'm	1
marshal.	1
Burs.	1
On	1
with	1
you--on	1
with	1
you--who	1
cares	1
what	1
you	1
are?	1
Wheel.	1
(to	1
Bursal,	1
aside).	1
You'll	1
pay	1
Finsbury	1
for	1
me,	1
you	1
rich	1
Jew?	1
(To	1
Lord	1
John.)	1
Your	1
lordship	1
will	1
remember	1
your	1
lordship's	1
promise.	1
Lord	1
J.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
usually	1
forget	1
my	1
promises,	1
sir;	1
and	1
therefore	1
need	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
reminded	1
of	1
them.	1
Wheel.	1
I	1
beg	1
pardon--I	1
beg	1
ten	1
thousand	1
pardons,	1
my	1
lord.	1
Burs.	1
(taking	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
arm).	1
Come	1
on,	1
man,	1
and	1
don't	1
stand	1
begging	1
pardon	1
there,	1
or	1
I'll	1
leave	1
you.	1
Wheel.	1
(to	1
Burs.)	1
I	1
beg	1
pardon,	1
Bursal--I	1
beg	1
pardon,	1
ten	1
thousand	1
times.	1
(Exeunt.)	1
Manent	1
LORD	1
JOHN	1
and	1
RORY	1
O'RYAN.	1
Rory.	1
Wheugh!--Now	1
put	1
the	1
case.	1
If	1
I	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
be	1
hanged,	1
for	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
me	1
I	1
couldn't	1
be	1
after	1
begging	1
so	1
many	1
pardons	1
for	1
nothing	1
at	1
all.	1
But	1
many	1
men,	1
many	1
minds--(Hums.)	1
True	1
game	1
to	1
the	1
last!	1
No	1
Wheeler	1
for	1
me.	1
Oh,	1
murder!	1
I	1
forgot,	1
I	1
was	1
nigh	1
letting	1
the	1
cat	1
out	1
o'	1
the	1
bag	1
again.	1
Lord	1
J.	1
You	1
had	1
something	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
me,	1
sir?	1
I	1
wait	1
till	1
your	1
recollection	1
returns.	1
Rory.	1
'Faith,	1
and	1
that's	1
very	1
kind	1
of	1
you;	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
had	1
always	1
done	1
so,	1
you	1
would	1
never	1
have	1
been	1
offended	1
with	1
me,	1
my	1
lord.	1
Lord	1
J.	1
You	1
are	1
mistaken,	1
Mr.	1
O'Ryan,	1
if	1
you	1
think	1
that	1
you	1
did	1
or	1
could	1
offend	1
me.	1
Rory.	1
Mistaken	1
was	1
I,	1
then,	1
sure	1
enough;	1
but	1
we	1
are	1
all	1
liable	1
to	1
mistakes,	1
and	1
should	1
forget	1
and	1
forgive	1
one	1
another;	1
that's	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
go	1
through.	1
Lord	1
J.	1
You	1
will	1
go	1
through	1
the	1
world	1
your	1
own	1
way,	1
Mr.	1
O'Ryan,	1
and	1
allow	1
me	1
to	1
go	1
through	1
it	1
my	1
way.	1
Rory.	1
Very	1
fair--fair	1
enough--then	1
we	1
shan't	1
cross.	1
But	1
now,	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
point.	1
I	1
don't	1
like	1
to	1
be	1
making	1
disagreeable	1
retrospects,	1
if	1
I	1
could	1
any	1
way	1
avoid	1
it;	1
nor	1
to	1
be	1
going	1
about	1
the	1
bush,	1
especially	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
o'	1
day;	1
when,	1
as	1
Mr.	1
Finsbury's	1
come,	1
we've	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
time	1
to	1
lose	1
as	1
we	1
had.	1
Is	1
there	1
any	1
truth,	1
then,	1
my	1
lord,	1
in	1
the	1
report	1
that	1
is	1
going	1
about	1
this	1
hour	1
past,	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
gone	1
in	1
a	1
huff,	1
and	1
given	1
your	1
promise	1
there	1
to	1
that	1
sneaking	1
Wheeler	1
to	1
vote	1
for	1
him	1
now?	1
Lord	1
J.	1
In	1
answer	1
to	1
your	1
question,	1
sir,	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
inform	1
you	1
that	1
I	1
HAVE	1
promised	1
Mr.	1
Wheeler	1
to	1
vote	1
for	1
him.	1
Rory.	1
In	1
a	1
huff?--Ay,	1
now,	1
there	1
it	1
is!--Well,	1
when	1
a	1
man's	1
MAD,	1
to	1
be	1
sure,	1
he's	1
mad--and	1
that's	1
all	1
that	1
can	1
be	1
said	1
about	1
it.	1
And	1
I	1
know,	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
been	1
MAD	1
myself,	1
I	1
might	1
have	1
done	1
a	1
foolish	1
thing	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
another.	1
But	1
now,	1
my	1
lord,	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
mad--	1
Lord	1
J.	1
I	1
protest,	1
sir,	1
I	1
cannot	1
understand	1
you.	1
In	1
one	1
word,	1
sir,	1
I'm	1
neither	1
mad	1
nor	1
a	1
fool!--Your	1
most	1
obedient	1
(going,	1
angrily).	1
Rory	1
(holding	1
him).	1
Take	1
care	1
now;	1
you	1
are	1
going	1
mad	1
with	1
me	1
again.	1
But	1
phoo!	1
I	1
like	1
you	1
the	1
better	1
for	1
being	1
mad.	1
I'm	1
very	1
often	1
mad	1
myself,	1
and	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
give	1
a	1
potato	1
for	1
one	1
that	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
mad	1
in	1
his	1
life.	1
Lord	1
J.	1
(aside).	1
He'll	1
not	1
be	1
quiet,	1
till	1
he	1
makes	1
me	1
knock	1
him	1
down.	1
Rory.	1
Agh!	1
agh!	1
agh!--I	1
begin	1
to	1
guess	1
whereabouts	1
I	1
am	1
at	1
last.	1
MAD,	1
in	1
your	1
country,	1
I	1
take	1
it,	1
means	1
fit	1
for	1
Bedlam;	1
but	1
with	1
us	1
in	1
Ireland,	1
now,	1
'tis	1
no	1
such	1
thing;	1
it	1
mean's	1
nothing	1
in	1
life	1
but	1
the	1
being	1
in	1
a	1
passion.	1
Well,	1
one	1
comfort	1
is,	1
my	1
lord,	1
as	1
you're	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
a	1
scholar,	1
we	1
have	1
the	1
Latin	1
proverb	1
in	1
our	1
favour--"Ira	1
furor	1
brevis	1
est"	1
(Anger	1
is	1
short	1
madness).	1
The	1
shorter	1
the	1
better,	1
I	1
think.	1
So,	1
my	1
lord,	1
to	1
put	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
whatever	1
of	1
the	1
kind	1
you	1
may	1
have	1
felt	1
against	1
poor	1
Talbot,	1
I'll	1
assure	1
you	1
he's	1
as	1
innocent	1
o'	1
that	1
unfortunate	1
song	1
as	1
the	1
babe	1
unborn.	1
Lord	1
J.	1
It	1
is	1
rather	1
late	1
for	1
Mr.	1
Talbot	1
to	1
make	1
apologies	1
to	1
me.	1
Rory.	1
He	1
make	1
apologies!	1
Not	1
he,	1
'faith;	1
he'd	1
send	1
me	1
to	1
Coventry,	1
or,	1
maybe,	1
to	1
a	1
worse	1
place,	1
did	1
he	1
but	1
know	1
I	1
was	1
condescending	1
to	1
make	1
this	1
bit	1
of	1
explanation,	1
unknown	1
to	1
him.	1
But,	1
upon	1
my	1
conscience,	1
I've	1
a	1
regard	1
for	1
you	1
both,	1
and	1
don't	1
like	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
go	1
together	1
by	1
the	1
ears.	1
Now,	1
look	1
you,	1
my	1
lord.	1
By	1
this	1
book,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
books	1
that	1
were	1
ever	1
shut	1
and	1
opened,	1
he	1
never	1
saw	1
or	1
heard	1
of	1
that	1
unlucky	1
song	1
of	1
mine	1
till	1
I	1
came	1
out	1
with	1
it	1
this	1
morning.	1
Lord	1
J.	1
But	1
you	1
told	1
me	1
this	1
morning	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
he	1
who	1
wrote	1
it.	1
Rory.	1
For	1
that	1
I	1
take	1
shame	1
to	1
myself,	1
as	1
it	1
turned	1
out;	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
a	1
WHITE	1
lie	1
to	1
SARVE	1
a	1
friend,	1
and	1
make	1
him	1
cut	1
a	1
dash	1
with	1
a	1
new	1
song	1
at	1
election	1
time.	1
But	1
I've	1
done	1
for	1
ever	1
with	1
white	1
lies.	1
Lord	1
J.	1
(walking	1
about	1
as	1
if	1
agitated).	1
I	1
wish	1
you	1
had	1
never	1
begun	1
with	1
them,	1
Mr.	1
O'Ryan.	1
This	1
may	1
be	1
a	1
good	1
joke	1
to	1
you;	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
none	1
to	1
me	1
or	1
Talbot.	1
So	1
Talbot	1
never	1
wrote	1
a	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
song?	1
Rory.	1
Not	1
a	1
word	1
or	1
syllable,	1
good	1
or	1
bad.	1
Lord	1
J.	1
And	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
my	1
promise	1
to	1
vote	1
against	1
him.	1
He'll	1
lose	1
his	1
election.	1
Rory.	1
Not	1
if	1
you'll	1
give	1
me	1
leave	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
your	1
friends	1
in	1
your	1
name.	1
Lord	1
J.	1
I	1
have	1
promised	1
to	1
leave	1
them	1
to	1
themselves;	1
and	1
Wheeler,	1
I	1
am	1
sure,	1
has	1
engaged	1
them	1
by	1
this	1
time.	1
Rory.	1
Bless	1
my	1
body!	1
I'll	1
not	1
stay	1
prating	1
here	1
then.	1
(Exit	1
Rory.)	1
Lord	1
J.	1
(follows).	1
But	1
what	1
can	1
have	1
become	1
of	1
Talbot?	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
too	1
hasty	1
for	1
once	1
in	1
my	1
life.	1
Well,	1
I	1
shall	1
suffer	1
for	1
it	1
more	1
than	1
anybody	1
else;	1
for	1
I	1
love	1
Talbot,	1
since	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
make	1
the	1
song,	1
of	1
which	1
I	1
hate	1
to	1
think.	1
(Exit.)	1
SCENE	1
III.	1
A	1
large	1
hall	1
in	1
Eton	1
College--A	1
staircase	1
at	1
the	1
end--Eton	1
lads,	1
dressed	1
in	1
their	1
Montem	1
Dresses	1
in	1
the	1
Scene--In	1
front,	1
WHEELER	1
(dressed	1
as	1
Captain),	1
BURSAL	1
and	1
FINSBURY.	1
Fins.	1
I	1
give	1
you	1
infinite	1
credit,	1
Mr.	1
Wheeler,	1
for	1
this	1
dress.	1
Burs.	1
INFINITE	1
CREDIT!	1
Why,	1
he'll	1
have	1
no	1
objection	1
to	1
that--hey,	1
Wheeler?	1
But	1
I	1
thought	1
Finsbury	1
knew	1
you	1
too	1
well	1
to	1
give	1
you	1
credit	1
for	1
anything.	1
Fins.	1
You	1
are	1
pleased	1
to	1
be	1
pleasant,	1
sir.	1
Mr.	1
Wheeler	1
knows,	1
in	1
that	1
sense	1
of	1
the	1
word,	1
it	1
is	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
power	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
credit,	1
and	1
I'm	1
sure	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
ask	1
it.	1
Wheel.	1
(aside).	1
O,	1
Bursal,	1
pay	1
him,	1
and	1
I'll	1
pay	1
you	1
tomorrow.	1
Burs.	1
Now,	1
if	1
you	1
weren't	1
to	1
be	1
captain	1
after	1
all,	1
Wheeler,	1
what	1
a	1
pretty	1
figure	1
you'd	1
cut.	1
Ha!	1
ha!	1
ha!--Hey?	1
Wheel.	1
Oh,	1
I	1
am	1
as	1
sure	1
of	1
being	1
captain	1
as	1
of	1
being	1
alive.	1
(Aside.)	1
Do	1
pay	1
for	1
me,	1
now,	1
there's	1
a	1
good,	1
dear	1
fellow,	1
before	1
THEY	1
(looking	1
back)	1
come	1
up.	1
Burs.	1
(aside).	1
I	1
love	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
lick	1
the	1
dust.	1
(Aloud.)	1
Hollo!	1
here's	1
Finsbury	1
waiting	1
to	1
be	1
paid,	1
lads.	1
(To	1
the	1
lads	1
who	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
back	1
scene.)	1
Who	1
has	1
paid,	1
and	1
who	1
has	1
not	1
paid,	1
I	1
say?	1
(The	1
lads	1
come	1
forward,	1
and	1
several	1
exclaim	1
at	1
once,)	1
I've	1
paid!	1
I've	1
paid!	1
Enter	1
LORD	1
JOHN	1
and	1
RORY	1
O'RYAN.	1
Rory.	1
Oh,	1
King	1
of	1
Fashion,	1
how	1
fine	1
we	1
are!	1
Why,	1
now,	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
ye	1
all	1
one	1
might	1
fancy	1
one's	1
self	1
at	1
the	1
playhouse	1
at	1
once,	1
or	1
at	1
a	1
fancy	1
ball	1
in	1
dear	1
little	1
Dublin.	1
Come,	1
strike	1
up	1
a	1
dance.	1
Burs.	1
Pshaw!	1
Wherever	1
you	1
come,	1
Rory	1
O'Ryan,	1
no	1
one	1
else	1
can	1
be	1
heard.	1
Who	1
has	1
paid,	1
and	1
who	1
has	1
not	1
paid,	1
I	1
say?	1
Several	1
Boys	1
exclaim.	1
We've	1
all	1
paid.	1
1st	1
Boy.	1
I've	1
not	1
paid,	1
but	1
here's	1
my	1
money.	1
Several	1
Boys.	1
We	1
have	1
not	1
paid,	1
but	1
here's	1
our	1
money.	1
6th	1
Boy.	1
Order	1
there,	1
I	1
am	1
marshal.	1
All	1
that	1
have	1
paid	1
march	1
off	1
to	1
the	1
staircase,	1
and	1
take	1
your	1
seats	1
there,	1
one	1
by	1
one.	1
March!	1
(As	1
they	1
march	1
by,	1
one	1
by	1
one,	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
display	1
their	1
dresses,	1
Mr.	1
Finsbury	1
bows,	1
and	1
says,)	1
A	1
thousand	1
thanks,	1
gentlemen.	1
Thank	1
you,	1
gentlemen.	1
Thanks,	1
gentlemen.	1
The	1
finest	1
sight	1
ever	1
I	1
saw	1
out	1
of	1
Lon'on.	1
Rory,	1
as	1
each	1
lad	1
passes,	1

his	1

Are	1
you	1
a	1
TalbotITE	1
or	1
a	1
WheelerITE?	1
To	1
each	1
who	1
answers	1
"A	1
Wheelerite,"	1
Rory	1
replies,	1
"Phoo!	1
dance	1
off,	1
then.	1
Go	1
to	1
the	1
devil	1
and	1
shake	1
yourself."*	1
Each	1
who	1
answers	1
"A	1
Talbotite,"	1
Rory	1
shakes	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
violently,	1
singing,	1
"Talbot,	1
oh,	1
Talbot's	1
the	1
dog	1
for	1
Rory."	1
*This	1

When	1
they	1
have	1
almost	1
all	1
passed,	1
Lord	1
John	1
says,	1
But	1
where	1
can	1
Mr.	1
Talbot	1
be	1
all	1
this	1
time?	1
Burs.	1
Who	1
knows?	1
Who	1
cares?	1
Wheel.	1
A	1
pretty	1
electioneerer!	1
(Aside	1
to	1
Bursal.)	1
Finsbury's	1
waiting	1
to	1
be	1
paid.	1
Lord	1
J.	1
You	1
don't	1
wait	1
for	1
me,	1
Mr.	1
Finsbury.	1
You	1
know,	1
I	1
have	1
settled	1
with	1
you.	1
Fins.	1
Yes,	1
my	1
lord--yes.	1
Many	1
thanks:	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
left	1
your	1
lordship's	1
dress	1
here,	1
and	1
everybody's	1
dress,	1
I	1
believe,	1
as	1
bespoke.	1
Burs.	1
Here,	1
Finsbury,	1
is	1
the	1
money	1
for	1
Wheeler,	1
who,	1
between	1
you	1
and	1
me,	1
is	1
as	1
poor	1
as	1
a	1
rat.	1
Wheeler	1
(affecting	1
to	1
laugh.).	1
Well,	1
I	1
hope	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
rich	1
as	1
a	1
Jew	1
to-morrow.	1
(Bursal	1
counts	1
money,	1
in	1
an	1
ostentatious	1
manner,	1
into	1
Finsbury's	1
hand.)	1
Fins.	1
A	1
thousand	1
thanks	1
for	1
all	1
favours.	1
Rory.	1
You	1
will	1
be	1
kind	1
enough	1
to	1
LAVE	1
Mr.	1
Talbot's	1
dress	1
with	1
me,	1
Mr.	1
Finsbury,	1
for	1
I'm	1
a	1
friend.	1
Fins.	1
Indubitably,	1
sir:	1
but	1
the	1
misfortune	1
is--he!	1
he!	1
he!--Mr.	1
Talbot,	1
sir,	1
has	1
bespoke	1
no	1
dress.	1
Your	1
servant,	1
gentlemen.	1
(Exit	1
Finsbury.)	1
Burs.	1
So	1
your	1
friend	1
Mr.	1
Talbot	1
could	1
not	1
afford	1
to	1
bespeak	1
a	1
dress--	1
(Bursal	1
and	1
Wheeler	1
laugh	1
insolently.)	1
How	1
comes	1
that,	1
I	1
wonder?	1
Lord	1
J.	1
If	1
I'm	1
not	1
mistaken,	1
here	1
comes	1
Talbot	1
to	1
answer	1
for	1
himself.	1
Rory.	1
But	1
who,	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
St.	1
Patrick,	1
has	1
he	1
along	1
with	1
him?	1
Enter	1
TALBOT	1
and	1
LANDLORD.	1
Talb.	1
Come	1
in	1
along	1
with	1
us,	1
Farmer	1
Hearty--come	1
in.	1
(Whilst	1
the	1
Farmer	1
comes	1
in,	1
the	1
boys	1
who	1
were	1
sitting	1
on	1
the	1
stairs,	1
rise	1
and	1
exclaim,)	1
Whom	1
have	1
we	1
here?	1
What	1
now?	1
Come	1
down,	1
lads;	1
here's	1
more	1
fun.	1
Rory.	1
What's	1
here,	1
Talbot?	1
Talb.	1
An	1
honest	1
farmer,	1
and	1
a	1
good	1
natured	1
landlord,	1
who	1
would	1
come	1
here	1
along	1
with	1
me	1
to	1
speak--	1
Farm.	1
(interrupting).	1
To	1
speak	1
the	1
truth--(strikes	1
his	1
stick	1
on	1
the	1
ground).	1
Landlord	1
(unbuttoning	1
his	1
waistcoat).	1
But	1
I	1
am	1
so	1
hot--so	1
short-winded,	1
that	1
(panting	1
and	1
puffing)--that	1
for	1
the	1
soul	1
and	1
body	1
of	1
me,	1
I	1
cannot	1
say	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
got	1
for	1
to	1
say.	1
Rory.	1
'Faith,	1
now,	1
the	1
more	1
short	1
winded	1
a	1
story,	1
the	1
better,	1
to	1
my	1
fancy.	1
Burs.	1
Wheeler,	1
what's	1
the	1
matter,	1
man?	1
you	1
look	1
as	1
if	1
your	1
under	1
jaw	1
was	1
broke.	1
Farm.	1
The	1
matter	1
is,	1
young	1
gentlemen,	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
once	1
upon	1
a	1
time	1
a	1
fine,	1
bay	1
hunter.	1
Wheel.	1
(squeezing	1
up	1
to	1
Talbot,	1
aside).	1
Don't	1
expose	1
me,	1
don't	1
let	1
him	1
tell.	1
(To	1
the	1
Farmer.)	1
I'll	1
pay	1
for	1
the	1
corn	1
I	1
spoiled.	1
(To	1
the	1
Landlord.)	1
I'll	1
pay	1
for	1
the	1
horse.	1
Farm.	1
I	1
does	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
be	1
paid	1
for	1
my	1
corn.	1
The	1
short	1
of	1
it	1
is,	1
young	1
gentlemen,	1
this	1
'un	1
here,	1
in	1
the	1
fine	1
thing-em-bobs	1
(pointing	1
to	1
Wheeler),	1
is	1
a	1
shabby	1
fellow;	1
he	1
went	1
and	1
spoiled	1
Master	1
Newington's	1
best	1
hunter.	1
Land.	1
(panting).	1
Ruinationed	1
him!	1
ruinationed	1
him!	1
Rory.	1
But	1
was	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
shabbiness?	1
Now	1
I	1
might,	1
or	1
any	1
of	1
us	1
might,	1
have	1
had	1
such	1
an	1
accident	1
as	1
that.	1
I	1
suppose	1
he	1
paid	1
the	1
gentleman	1
for	1
the	1
horse,	1
or	1
will	1
do	1
so,	1
in	1
good	1
time.	1
Land.	1
(holding	1
his	1
sides).	1
Oh,	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
but	1
a	1
little	1
breath	1
in	1
this	1
body	1
o'	1
mine	1
to	1
speak	1
all--speak	1
on,	1
Farmer.	1
Farm.	1
(striking	1
his	1
stick	1
on	1
the	1
floor).	1
Oons,	1
sir,	1
when	1
a	1
man's	1
put	1
out,	1
he	1
can't	1
go	1
on	1
with	1
his	1
story.	1
Omnes.	1
Be	1
quiet,	1
Rory--hush!	1
(Rory	1
puts	1
his	1
finger	1
on	1
his	1
lips.)	1
Farm.	1
Why,	1
sir,	1
I	1
was	1
a-going	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
the	1
shabbiness--why,	1
sir,	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
pay	1
the	1
landlord,	1
here,	1
for	1
the	1
horse;	1
but	1
he	1
goes	1
and	1
says	1
to	1
the	1
landlord,	1
here--"Mr.	1
Talbot	1
had	1
your	1
horse	1
on	1
the	1
self-same	1
day;	1
'twas	1
he	1
did	1
the	1
damage;	1
'tis	1
from	1
he	1
you	1
must	1
get	1
your	1
money."	1
So	1
Mr.	1
Talbot,	1
here,	1
who	1
is	1
another	1
sort	1
of	1
a	1
gentleman	1
(though	1
he	1
has	1
not	1
so	1
fine	1
a	1
coat)	1
would	1
not	1
see	1
a	1
man	1
at	1
a	1
loss,	1
that	1
could	1
not	1
afford	1
it;	1
and	1
not	1
knowing	1
which	1
of	1
'em	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
spoiled	1
the	1
horse,	1
goes,	1
when	1
he	1
finds	1
the	1
other	1
would	1
not	1
pay	1
a	1
farthing,	1
and	1
pays	1
all.	1
Rory	1
(rubbing	1
his	1
hands).	1
There's	1
Talbot	1
for	1
ye.	1
And,	1
now,	1
gentlemen	1
(to	1
Wheeler	1
and	1
Bursal),	1
you	1
guess	1
the	1
RASON,	1
as	1
I	1
do,	1
I	1
suppose,	1
why	1
he	1
bespoke	1
no	1
dress;	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
money	1
enough	1
to	1
be	1
fine--and	1
honest,	1
too.	1
You	1
are	1
very	1
fine,	1
Mr.	1
Wheeler,	1
to	1
do	1
you	1
justice.	1
Lord	1
J.	1
Pray,	1
Mr.	1
O'Ryan,	1
let	1
the	1
farmer	1
go	1
on;	1
he	1
has	1
more	1
to	1
say.	1
How	1
did	1
you	1
find	1
out,	1
pray,	1
my	1
good	1
friend,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
Talbot	1
who	1
spoiled	1
the	1
horse!	1
Speak	1
loud	1
enough	1
to	1
be	1
heard	1
by	1
everybody.	1
Farm.	1
Ay,	1
that	1
I	1
will--I	1
say	1
(very	1
loudly)	1
I	1
say	1
I	1
saw	1
him	1
there	1
(pointing	1
to	1
Wheeler)	1
take	1
the	1
jump	1
which	1
strained	1
the	1
horse;	1
and	1
I'm	1
ready	1
to	1
swear	1
to	1
it.	1
Yet	1
he	1
let	1
another	1
pay;	1
there's	1
the	1
shabbiness.	1
(A	1
general	1
groan	1
from	1
all	1
the	1
lads.	1
"Oh,	1
shabby	1
Wheeler,	1
shabby!	1
I'll	1
not	1
vote	1
for	1
shabby	1
Wheeler!")	1
Lord	1
J.	1
(aside).	1
Alas!	1
I	1
must	1
vote	1
for	1
him.	1
Rory	1
sings.	1
"True	1
game	1
to	1
the	1
last;	1
no	1
Wheeler	1
for	1
me;	1
Talbot,	1
oh,	1
Talbot's	1
the	1
dog	1
for	1
me."	1
(Several	1
voices	1
join	1
the	1
chorus.)	1
Burs.	1
Wheeler,	1
if	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
chosen	1
Captain,	1
you	1
must	1
see	1
and	1
pay	1
me	1
for	1
the	1
dress.	1
Wheel.	1
I	1
am	1
as	1
poor	1
as	1
a	1
rat.	1
Rory.	1
Oh,	1
yes!	1
oh	1
yes!	1
hear	1
ye!	1
hear	1
ye,	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
men--the	1
election	1
is	1
now	1
going	1
to	1
begin	1
forthwith	1
in	1
the	1
big	1
field,	1
and	1
Rory	1
O'Ryan	1
holds	1
the	1
poll	1
for	1
Talbot.	1
Talbot	1
for	1
ever!--huzza!	1
(Exit	1
Rory,	1
followed	1
by	1
the	1
Boys,	1
who	1
exclaim	1
"Talbot	1
for	1
ever!--huzza!"	1
The	1
Landlord	1
and	1
Farmer	1
join	1
them.)	1
Lord	1
J.	1
Talbot,	1
I	1
am	1
glad	1
you	1
are	1
what	1
I	1
always	1
thought	1
you--I'm	1
glad	1
you	1
did	1
not	1
write	1
that	1
odious	1
song.	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
lose	1
such	1
a	1
friend	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
songs	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
Forgive	1
me	1
for	1
my	1
hastiness	1
this	1
morning.	1
I've	1
punished	1
myself--I've	1
promised	1
to	1
vote	1
for	1
Wheeler.	1
Talb.	1
Oh,	1
no	1
matter	1
whom	1
you	1
vote	1
for,	1
my	1
lord,	1
if	1
you	1
are	1
still	1
my	1
friend,	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
know	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
yours.	1
(They	1
shake	1
hands.)	1
Lord	1
J.	1
I	1
must	1
not	1
say,	1
"Huzza	1
for	1
Talbot!"	1
(Exeunt.)	1
SCENE	1
IV.	1
WINDSOR	1
TERRACE.	1
LADY	1
PIERCEFIELD,	1
MRS.	1
TALBOT,	1
LOUISA,	1
and	1
a	1
little	1
girl	1
of	1
six	1
years	1
old,	1
LADY	1
VIOLETTA,	1
daughter	1
to	1
LADY	1
PIERCEFIELD.	1
Violetta	1
(looking	1
at	1
a	1
paper	1
which	1
Louisa	1
holds).	1
I	1
like	1
it	1
VERY	1
much.	1
Lady	1
P.	1
What	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
you	1
like	1
VERY	1
much,	1
Violetta?	1
Violet.	1
You	1
are	1
not	1
to	1
know	1
yet,	1
mamma;	1
it	1
is--I	1
may	1
tell	1
her	1
that--it	1
is	1
a	1
little	1
drawing	1
that	1
Louisa	1
is	1
doing	1
for	1
me.	1
Louisa,	1
I	1
wish	1
you	1
would	1
let	1
me	1
show	1
it	1
to	1
mamma.	1
Louisa.	1
And	1
welcome,	1
my	1
dear;	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
a	1
sketch	1
of	1
"The	1
Little	1
Merchants,"	1
a	1
story	1
which	1
Violetta	1
was	1
reading,	1
and	1
she	1
asked	1
me	1
to	1
try	1
to	1
draw	1
the	1
pictures	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
merchants	1
for	1
her.	1
(Whilst	1
Lady	1
P.	1
looks	1
at	1
the	1
drawing,	1
Violetta	1
says	1
to	1
Louisa)	1
But	1
are	1
you	1
in	1
earnest,	1
Louisa,	1
about	1
what	1
you	1
were	1
saying	1
to	1
me	1
just	1
now,--quite	1
in	1
earnest?	1
Louisa.	1
Yes,	1
in	1
earnest,--quite	1
in	1
earnest,	1
my	1
dear.	1
Violet.	1
And	1
may	1
I	1
ask	1
mamma,	1
NOW?	1
Louisa.	1
If	1
you	1
please,	1
my	1
dear.	1
Violet.	1
(runs	1
to	1
her	1
mother).	1
Stoop	1
down	1
to	1
me,	1
mamma	1
;	1
I've	1
something	1
to	1
whisper	1
to	1
you.	1
(Lady	1
Piercefield	1
stoops	1
down;	1
Violetta	1
throws	1
her	1
arms	1
round	1
her	1
mother's	1
neck.)	1
Violet.	1
(aside	1
to	1
her	1
mother).	1
Mamma,	1
do	1
you	1
know--you	1
know	1
you	1
want	1
a	1
governess	1
for	1
me.	1
Lady	1
P.	1
Yes,	1
if	1
I	1
could	1
find	1
a	1
good	1
one.	1
Violet.	1
(aloud).	1
Stoop	1
again,	1
mamma,	1
I've	1
more	1
to	1
whisper.	1
(Aside	1
to	1
her	1
mother).	1
SHE	1
says	1
she	1
will	1
be	1
my	1
governess,	1
if	1
you	1
please.	1
Lady	1
P.	1
SHE!--who	1
is	1
SHE?	1
Violet.	1
Louisa.	1
Lady	1
P.	1
(patting	1
Violetta's	1
cheek).	1
You	1
are	1
a	1
little	1
fool.	1
Miss	1
Talbot	1
is	1
only	1
playing	1
with	1
you.	1
Violet.	1
No,	1
indeed,	1
mamma;	1
she	1
is	1
in	1
earnest;	1
are	1
not	1
you,	1
Louisa?--Oh,	1
say	1
yes!	1
Louisa.	1
Yes.	1
Violet.	1
(claps	1
her	1
hands).	1
YES,	1
mamma;	1
do	1
you	1
hear	1
YES?	1
Louisa.	1
If	1
Lady	1
Piercefield	1
will	1
trust	1
you	1
to	1
my	1
care,	1
I	1
am	1
persuaded	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
much	1
happier	1
as	1
your	1
governess,	1
my	1
good	1
little	1
Violetta,	1
than	1
as	1
an	1
humble	1
dependent	1
of	1
Miss	1
Bursal's.	1
(Aside	1
to	1
her	1
mother.)	1
You	1
see	1
that,	1
now	1
I	1
am	1
put	1
to	1
the	1
trial,	1
I	1
keep	1
to	1
my	1
resolution,	1
dear	1
mother.	1
Mrs.	1
T.	1
Your	1
ladyship	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
surprised	1
at	1
this	1
offer	1
of	1
my	1
Louisa,	1
if	1
you	1
had	1
heard,	1
as	1
we	1
have	1
done	1
within	1
these	1
few	1
hours,	1
of	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
the	1
East	1
India	1
ship	1
in	1
which	1
almost	1
our	1
whole	1
property	1
was	1
embarked.	1
Louisa.	1
The	1
Bombay	1
Castle	1
is	1
wrecked.	1
Lady	1
P.	1
The	1
Bombay	1
Castle!	1
I	1
have	1
the	1
pleasure	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
misinformed--it	1
was	1
the	1
Airly	1
Castle	1
that	1
was	1
wrecked.	1
Louisa	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
T.	1
Indeed!	1
Lady	1
P.	1
Yes;	1
you	1
may	1
depend	1
upon	1
it--it	1
was	1
the	1
Airly	1
Castle	1
that	1
was	1
lost.	1
You	1
know	1
I	1
am	1
just	1
come	1
from	1
Portsmouth,	1
where	1
I	1
went	1
to	1
meet	1
my	1
brother,	1
Governor	1
Morton,	1
who	1
came	1
home	1
with	1
the	1
last	1
India	1
fleet,	1
and	1
from	1
whom	1
I	1
had	1
the	1
intelligence.	1
(Here	1
Violetta	1
interrupts,	1
to	1
ask	1
her	1
mother	1
for	1
her	1
nosegay--Lady	1
P.	1
gives	1
it	1
to	1
her,	1
then	1
goes	1
on	1
speaking.)	1
Lady	1
P.	1
They	1
were	1
in	1
such	1
haste,	1
foolish	1
people!	1
to	1
carry	1
their	1
news	1
to	1
London,	1
that	1
they	1
mistook	1
one	1
castle	1
for	1
another.	1
But	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
Mr.	1
Bursal	1
loses	1
fifty	1
thousand	1
pounds,	1
it	1
is	1
said,	1
by	1
the	1
Airly	1
Castle!	1
When	1
I	1
told	1
him	1
she	1
was	1
lost,	1
I	1
thought	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
dropped	1
down.	1
However,	1
I	1
found	1
he	1
comforted	1
himself	1
afterwards	1
with	1
a	1
bottle	1
of	1
Burgundy:	1
but	1
poor	1
Miss	1
Bursal	1
has	1
been	1
in	1
hysterics	1
ever	1
since.	1
Mrs.	1
T.	1
Poor	1
girl!	1
My	1
Louisa,	1
YOU	1
did	1
not	1
fall	1
into	1
hysterics,	1
when	1
I	1
told	1
you	1
of	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
our	1
whole	1
fortune.	1
(Violetta,	1
during	1
this	1
dialogue,	1
has	1
been	1
seated	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
making	1
up	1
a	1
nosegay.)	1
Violet.	1
(aside).	1
Fall	1
into	1
hysterics!	1
What	1
are	1
hysterics,	1
I	1
wonder.	1
Louisa.	1
Miss	1
Bursal	1
is	1
much	1
to	1
be	1
pitied;	1
for	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
wealth	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
happiness	1
to	1
her.	1
Lady	1
P.	1
It	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
hoped	1
that	1
the	1
loss	1
may	1
at	1
least	1
check	1
the	1
foolish	1
pride	1
and	1
extravagance	1
of	1
young	1
Bursal,	1
who,	1
as	1
my	1
son	1
tells	1
me--	1
(A	1
cry	1
of	1
"Huzza!	1
huzza!"	1
behind	1
the	1
scenes.)	1
Enter	1
LORD	1
JOHN.	1
Lord	1
J.	1
(hastily).	1
How	1
d'ye	1
do,	1
mother!	1
Miss	1
Talbot,	1
I	1
give	1
you	1
joy.	1
Lady	1
P.	1
Take	1
breath--take	1
breath.	1
Louisa.	1
It	1
is	1
my	1
brother.	1
Mrs.	1
T.	1
Here	1
he	1
is!--Hark!	1
hark!	1
(A	1
cry	1
behind	1
the	1
scenes	1
of	1
"Talbot	1
and	1
truth	1
for	1
ever!	1
Huzza!")	1
Louisa.	1
They	1
are	1
chairing	1
him.	1
Lord	1
J.	1
Yes,	1
they	1
are	1
chairing	1
him;	1
and	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
chosen	1
for	1
his	1
honourable	1
conduct,	1
not	1
for	1
his	1
electioneering	1
skill;	1
for,	1
to	1
do	1
him	1
justice,	1
Coriolanus	1
himself	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
worse	1
electioneerer.	1
Enter	1
RORY	1
O'RYAN	1
and	1
another	1
Eton	1
lad,	1
carrying	1
TALBOT	1
in	1
a	1
chair,	1
followed	1
by	1
a	1
crowd	1
of	1
Eton	1
lads.	1
Rory.	1
By	1
your	1
LAVE,	1
my	1
lord--by	1
your	1
LAVE,	1
ladies.	1
Omnes.	1
Huzza!	1
Talbot	1
and	1
truth	1
for	1
ever!	1
Huzza!	1
Talb.	1
Set	1
me	1
down!	1
There's	1
my	1
mother!	1
There's	1
my	1
sister!	1
Rory.	1
Easy,	1
easy.	1
Set	1
him	1
down?	1
No	1
such	1
TING!	1
give	1
him	1
t'other	1
huzza!	1
There's	1
nothing	1
like	1
a	1
good	1
loud	1
huzza	1
in	1
this	1
world.	1
Yes,	1
there	1
is!	1
for,	1
as	1
my	1
Lord	1
John	1
said	1
just	1
now,	1
out	1
of	1
some	1
book,	1
or	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
head,--	1
"One	1
self-approving	1
hour	1
whole	1
years	1
outweighs,	1
Of	1
stupid	1
starers	1
and	1
of	1
loud	1
huzzas."	1
CURTAIN	1
FALLS.	1
FORGIVE	1
AND	1
FORGET.	1
In	1
the	1
neighbourhood	1
of	1
a	1
seaport	1
town	1
in	1
the	1
west	1
of	1
England,	1
there	1
lived	1
a	1
gardener,	1
who	1
had	1
one	1
son,	1
called	1
Maurice,	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
partial.	1
One	1
day	1
his	1
father	1
sent	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
neighbouring	1
town	1
to	1
purchase	1
some	1
garden	1
seeds	1
for	1
him.	1
When	1
Maurice	1
got	1
to	1
the	1
seed-shop,	1
it	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
people,	1
who	1
were	1
all	1
impatient	1
to	1
be	1
served:	1
first	1
a	1
great	1
tall	1
man,	1
and	1
next	1
a	1
great	1
fat	1
woman	1
pushed	1
before	1
him;	1
and	1
he	1
stood	1
quietly	1
beside	1
the	1
counter,	1
waiting	1
till	1
somebody	1
should	1
be	1
at	1
leisure	1
to	1
attend	1
to	1
him.	1
At	1
length,	1
when	1
all	1
the	1
other	1
people	1
who	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
shop	1
had	1
got	1
what	1
they	1
wanted,	1
the	1
shopman	1
turned	1
to	1
Maurice--"And	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
want,	1
my	1
patient	1
little	1
fellow?"	1
said	1
he.	1
"I	1
want	1
all	1
these	1
seeds	1
for	1
my	1
father,"	1
said	1
Maurice,	1
putting	1
a	1
list	1
of	1
seeds	1
into	1
the	1
shopman's	1
hand;	1
"and	1
I	1
have	1
brought	1
money	1
to	1
pay	1
for	1
them	1
all."	1
The	1
seedsman	1
looked	1
out	1
all	1
the	1
seeds	1
that	1
Maurice	1
wanted,	1
and	1
packed	1
them	1
up	1
in	1
paper:	1
he	1
was	1
folding	1
up	1
some	1
painted	1
lady-peas,	1
when,	1
from	1
a	1
door	1
at	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
the	1
shop,	1
there	1
came	1
in	1
a	1
square,	1
rough-faced	1
man,	1
who	1
exclaimed,	1
the	1
moment	1
he	1
came	1
in,	1
"Are	1
the	1
seeds	1
I	1
ordered	1
ready?--	1
The	1
wind's	1
fair--they	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
aboard	1
yesterday.	1
And	1
my	1
china	1
jar,	1
is	1
it	1
packed	1
up	1
and	1
directed?	1
where	1
is	1
it?"	1
"It	1
is	1
up	1
there	1
on	1
the	1
shelf	1
over	1
your	1
head,	1
sir,"	1
answered	1
the	1
seedsman.	1
"It	1
is	1
very	1
safe,	1
you	1
see;	1
but	1
we	1
have	1
not	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
pack	1
it	1
yet.	1
It	1
shall	1
be	1
done	1
to-day;	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
get	1
the	1
seeds	1
ready	1
for	1
you,	1
sir,	1
immediately."	1
"Immediately!	1
then	1
stir	1
about	1
it.	1
The	1
seeds	1
will	1
not	1
pack	1
themselves	1
up.	1
Make	1
haste,	1
pray."	1
"Immediately,	1
sir,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
up	1
the	1
parcel	1
for	1
this	1
little	1
boy."	1
"What	1
signifies	1
the	1
parcel	1
for	1
this	1
little	1
boy?	1
He	1
can	1
wait,	1
and	1
I	1
cannot--wind	1
and	1
tide	1
wait	1
for	1
no	1
man.	1
Here,	1
my	1
good	1
lad,	1
take	1
your	1
parcel,	1
and	1
sheer	1
off,"	1
said	1
the	1
impatient	1
man;	1
and,	1
as	1
he	1
spoke,	1
he	1
took	1
up	1
the	1
parcel	1
of	1
seeds	1
from	1
the	1
counter,	1
as	1
the	1
shopman	1
stooped	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
a	1
sheet	1
of	1
thick	1
brown	1
paper	1
and	1
packthread	1
to	1
tie	1
it	1
up.	1
The	1
parcel	1
was	1
but	1
loosely	1
folded	1
up,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
impatient	1
man	1
lifted	1
it,	1
the	1
weight	1
of	1
the	1
peas	1
which	1
were	1
withinside	1
of	1
it	1
burst	1
the	1
paper,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
seeds	1
fell	1
out	1
upon	1
the	1
floor,	1
whilst	1
Maurice	1
in	1
vain	1
held	1
his	1
hands	1
to	1
catch	1
them.	1
The	1
peas	1
rolled	1
to	1
all	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
shop;	1
the	1
impatient	1
man	1
swore	1
at	1
them,	1
but	1
Maurice,	1
without	1
being	1
out	1
of	1
humour,	1
set	1
about	1
collecting	1
them	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
possible.	1
Whilst	1
the	1
boy	1
was	1
busied	1
in	1
this	1
manner,	1
the	1
man	1
got	1
what	1
seeds	1
he	1
wanted;	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
talking	1
about	1
them,	1
a	1
sailor	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
shop,	1
and	1
said,	1
"Captain,	1
the	1
wind	1
has	1
changed	1
within	1
these	1
five	1
minutes,	1
and	1
it	1
looks	1
as	1
if	1
we	1
should	1
have	1
ugly	1
weather."	1
"Well,	1
I'm	1
glad	1
of	1
it,"	1
replied	1
the	1
rough	1
faced	1
man,	1
who	1
was	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
a	1
ship.	1
"I	1
am	1
glad	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
day	1
longer	1
to	1
stay	1
ashore,	1
and	1
I've	1
business	1
enough	1
on	1
my	1
hands."	1
The	1
captain	1
pushed	1
forward	1
towards	1
the	1
shop	1
door.	1
Maurice,	1
who	1
was	1
kneeling	1
on	1
the	1
floor,	1
picking	1
up	1
his	1
seeds,	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
captain's	1
foot	1
was	1
entangled	1
in	1
some	1
packthread	1
which	1
hung	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
shelf	1
on	1
which	1
the	1
china	1
jar	1
stood.	1
Maurice	1
saw	1
that,	1
if	1
the	1
captain	1
took	1
one	1
more	1
step	1
forward,	1
he	1
must	1
pull	1
the	1
string,	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
throw	1
down	1
the	1
jar,	1
round	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
packthread	1
was	1
entangled.	1
He	1
immediately	1
caught	1
hold	1
of	1
the	1
captain's	1
leg,	1
and	1
stopped	1
him.	1
"Stay!	1
Stand	1
still,	1
sir!"	1
said	1
he,	1
"or	1
you	1
will	1
break	1
your	1
china	1
jar."	1
The	1
man	1
stood	1
still,	1
looked,	1
and	1
saw	1
how	1
the	1
packthread	1
had	1
caught	1
in	1
his	1
shoe	1
buckle,	1
and	1
how	1
it	1
was	1
near	1
dragging	1
down	1
his	1
beautiful	1
china	1
jar.	1
"I	1
am	1
really	1
very	1
much	1
obliged	1
to	1
you,	1
my	1
little	1
fellow,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"You	1
have	1
saved	1
my	1
jar,	1
which	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
broken	1
for	1
ten	1
guineas,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
for	1
my	1
wife,	1
and	1
I've	1
brought	1
it	1
safe	1
from	1
abroad	1
many	1
a	1
league.	1
It	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
pity	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
broken	1
it	1
just	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
safe	1
landed.	1
I	1
am	1
really	1
much	1
obliged	1
to	1
you,	1
my	1
little	1
fellow,	1
this	1
was	1
returning	1
good	1
for	1
evil.	1
I	1
am	1
sorry	1
I	1
threw	1
down	1
your	1
seeds,	1
as	1
you	1
are	1
such	1
a	1
good	1
natured,	1
forgiving	1
boy.	1
Be	1
so	1
kind,"	1
continued	1
he,	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
shopman,	1
"as	1
to	1
reach	1
down	1
that	1
china	1
jar	1
for	1
me."	1
The	1
shopman	1
lifted	1
down	1
the	1
jar	1
very	1
carefully,	1
and	1
the	1
captain	1
took	1
off	1
the	1
cover,	1
and	1
pulled	1
out	1
some	1
tulip	1
roots.	1
"You	1
seem,	1
by	1
the	1
quantity	1
of	1
seeds	1
you	1
have	1
got,	1
to	1
belong	1
to	1
a	1
gardener.	1
Are	1
you	1
fond	1
of	1
gardening?"	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
Maurice.	1
"Yes,	1
sir,"	1
replied	1
Maurice,	1
"very	1
fond	1
of	1
it;	1
for	1
my	1
father	1
is	1
a	1
gardener,	1
and	1
he	1
lets	1
me	1
help	1
him	1
at	1
his	1
work,	1
and	1
he	1
has	1
given	1
me	1
a	1
little	1
garden	1
of	1
my	1
own."	1
"Then	1
here	1
are	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
tulip-roots	1
for	1
you;	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
take	1
care	1
of	1
them,	1
I'll	1
promise	1
you	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
have	1
the	1
finest	1
tulips	1
in	1
England	1
in	1
your	1
little	1
garden.	1
These	1
tulips	1
were	1
given	1
to	1
me	1
by	1
a	1
Dutch	1
merchant,	1
who	1
told	1
me	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
rarest	1
and	1
finest	1
in	1
Holland.	1
They	1
will	1
prosper	1
with	1
you,	1
I'm	1
sure,	1
wind	1
and	1
weather	1
permitting."	1
Maurice	1
thanked	1
the	1
gentleman,	1
and	1
returned	1
home,	1
eager	1
to	1
show	1
his	1
precious	1
tulip-roots	1
to	1
his	1
father,	1
and	1
to	1
a	1
companion	1
of	1
his,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
a	1
nurseryman,	1
who	1
lived	1
near	1
him.	1
Arthur	1
was	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
nurseryman's	1
son.	1
The	1
first	1
thing	1
Maurice	1
did,	1
after	1
showing	1
his	1
tulip-roots	1
to	1
his	1
father,	1
was	1
to	1
run	1
to	1
Arthur's	1
garden	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
him.	1
Their	1
gardens	1
were	1
separated	1
only	1
by	1
a	1
low	1
wall	1
of	1
loose	1
stones:	1
"Arthur!	1
Arthur!	1
where	1
are	1
you?	1
Are	1
you	1
in	1
your	1
garden!	1
I	1
want	1
you."	1
But	1
Arthur	1
made	1
no	1
answer,	1
and	1
did	1
not,	1
as	1
usual,	1
come	1
running	1
to	1
meet	1
his	1
friend.	1
"I	1
know	1
where	1
you	1
are,"	1
continued	1
Maurice,	1
"and	1
I'm	1
coming	1
to	1
you	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
the	1
raspberry-bushes	1
will	1
let	1
me.	1
I	1
have	1
good	1
news	1
for	1
you--something	1
you'll	1
be	1
delighted	1
to	1
see,	1
Arthur!--Ha!--but	1
here	1
is	1
something	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
delighted	1
to	1
see,	1
I	1
am	1
sure,"	1
said	1
poor	1
Maurice,	1
who,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
got	1
through	1
the	1
raspberry-bushes,	1
and	1
had	1
come	1
in	1
sight	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
garden,	1
beheld	1
his	1
bell-glass--his	1
beloved	1
bell-glass,	1
under	1
which	1
his	1
cucumbers	1
were	1
grown	1
so	1
finely--his	1
only	1
bell-glass,	1
broken	1
to	1
pieces!	1
"I	1
am	1
sorry	1
for	1
it,"	1
said	1
Arthur,	1
who	1
stood	1
leaning	1
upon	1
his	1
spade	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
garden;	1
"I	1
am	1
afraid	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
very	1
angry	1
with	1
me."	1
"Why,	1
was	1
it	1
you,	1
Arthur,	1
broke	1
my	1
bell-glass!	1
Oh,	1
how	1
could	1
you	1
do	1
so?"	1
"I	1
was	1
throwing	1
weeds	1
and	1
rubbish	1
over	1
the	1
wall,	1
and	1
by	1
accident	1
a	1
great	1
lump	1
of	1
couch-grass,	1
with	1
stones	1
hanging	1
to	1
the	1
roots,	1
fell	1
upon	1
your	1
bell-glass,	1
and	1
broke	1
it,	1
as	1
you	1
see."	1
Maurice	1
lifted	1
up	1
the	1
lump	1
of	1
couch-grass,	1
which	1
had	1
fallen	1
through	1
the	1
broken	1
glass	1
upon	1
his	1
cucumbers,	1
and	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
cucumbers	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
in	1
silence--"Oh,	1
my	1
poor	1
cucumbers!	1
you	1
must	1
all	1
die	1
now.	1
I	1
shall	1
see	1
all	1
your	1
yellow	1
flowers	1
withered	1
tomorrow;	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
done,	1
and	1
it	1
cannot	1
be	1
helped;	1
so,	1
Arthur,	1
let	1
us	1
say	1
no	1
more	1
about	1
it."	1
"You	1
are	1
very	1
good;	1
I	1
thought	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
angry.	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
exceedingly	1
angry	1
if	1
you	1
had	1
broken	1
the	1
glass,	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
mine."	1
"Oh,	1
forgive	1
and	1
forget,	1
as	1
my	1
father	1
always	1
says;	1
that's	1
the	1
best	1
way.	1
Look	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
got	1
for	1
you."	1
Then	1
he	1
told	1
Arthur	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
ship,	1
and	1
the	1
china	1
jar;	1
the	1
seeds	1
having	1
been	1
thrown	1
down,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
fine	1
tulip-roots	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
given	1
to	1
him;	1
and	1
Maurice	1
concluded	1
by	1
offering	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
precious	1
roots	1
to	1
Arthur,	1
who	1
thanked	1
him	1
with	1
great	1
joy,	1
and	1
repeatedly	1
said,	1
"How	1
good	1
you	1
were	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
angry	1
with	1
me	1
for	1
breaking	1
your	1
bell-glass!	1
I	1
am	1
much	1
more	1
sorry	1
for	1
it	1
than	1
if	1
you	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
a	1
passion	1
with	1
me!"	1
Arthur	1
now	1
went	1
to	1
plant	1
his	1
tulip-root:	1
and	1
Maurice	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
beds	1
which	1
his	1
companion	1
had	1
been	1
digging,	1
and	1
at	1
all	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
were	1
coming	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
garden.	1
"I	1
don't	1
know	1
how	1
it	1
is,"	1
said	1
Arthur,	1
"but	1
you	1
always	1
seem	1
as	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
things	1
in	1
my	1
garden	1
coming	1
up,	1
and	1
doing	1
well,	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
your	1
own.	1
I	1
am	1
much	1
happier	1
since	1
my	1
father	1
came	1
to	1
live	1
here,	1
and	1
since	1
you	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
allowed	1
to	1
work	1
and	1
to	1
play	1
together,	1
than	1
I	1
ever	1
was	1
before;	1
for	1
you	1
must	1
know,	1
before	1
we	1
came	1
to	1
live	1
here,	1
I	1
had	1
a	1
cousin	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
with	1
me,	1
who	1
used	1
to	1
plague	1
me.	1
He	1
was	1
not	1
nearly	1
so	1
good-natured	1
as	1
you	1
are.	1
He	1
never	1
took	1
pleasure	1
in	1
looking	1
at	1
my	1
garden,	1
or	1
at	1
anything	1
that	1
I	1
did	1
that	1
was	1
well	1
done;	1
and	1
he	1
never	1
gave	1
me	1
a	1
share	1
of	1
anything	1
that	1
he	1
had;	1
and	1
so	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
him;	1
how	1
could	1
I?	1
But,	1
I	1
believe	1
that	1
hating	1
people	1
makes	1
us	1
unhappy;	1
for	1
I	1
know	1
I	1
never	1
was	1
happy	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
quarrelling	1
with	1
him;	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
always	1
happy	1
with	1
you,	1
Maurice.	1
You	1
know	1
we	1
never	1
quarrel."	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
well	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
if	1
they	1
could	1
be	1
convinced,	1
like	1
Arthur,	1
that	1
to	1
live	1
in	1
friendship	1
is	1
better	1
than	1
to	1
quarrel.	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
well	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
if	1
they	1
followed	1
Maurice's	1
maxim	1
of	1
"Forgive	1
and	1
Forget,"	1
when	1
they	1
receive,	1
or	1
when	1
they	1
imagine	1
that	1
they	1
receive,	1
an	1
injury.	1
Arthur's	1
father,	1
Mr.	1
Oakly,	1
the	1
nurseryman,	1
was	1
apt	1
to	1
take	1
offence	1
at	1
trifles;	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
thought	1
that	1
any	1
of	1
his	1
neighbours	1
disobliged	1
him,	1
he	1
was	1
too	1
proud	1
to	1
ask	1
them	1
to	1
explain	1
their	1
conduct;	1
therefore	1
he	1
was	1
often	1
mistaken	1
in	1
his	1
judgment	1
of	1
them.	1
He	1
thought	1
that	1
it	1
showed	1
SPIRIT,	1
to	1
remember	1
and	1
to	1
resent	1
an	1
injury;	1
and,	1
therefore,	1
though	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
an	1
ill-natured	1
man,	1
he	1
was	1
sometimes	1
led,	1
by	1
this	1
mistaken	1
idea	1
of	1
SPIRIT,	1
to	1
do	1
ill-natured	1
things:	1
"A	1
warm	1
friend	1
and	1
a	1
bitter	1
enemy,"	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
maxims,	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
many	1
more	1
enemies	1
than	1
friends.	1
He	1
was	1
not	1
very	1
rich,	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
proud;	1
and	1
his	1
favourite	1
proverb	1
was,	1
"Better	1
live	1
in	1
spite	1
than	1
in	1
pity."	1
When	1
first	1
he	1
settled	1
near	1
Mr.	1
Grant,	1
the	1
gardener,	1
he	1
felt	1
inclined	1
to	1
dislike	1
him,	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
told	1
that	1
Mr.	1
Grant	1
was	1
a	1
Scotchman,	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
prejudice	1
against	1
Scotchmen;	1
all	1
of	1
whom	1
he	1
believed	1
to	1
be	1
cunning	1
and	1
avaricious,	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
once	1
been	1
over-reached	1
by	1
a	1
Scotch	1
peddler.	1
Grant's	1
friendly	1
manners	1
in	1
some	1
degree	1
conquered	1
this	1
prepossession	1
but	1
still	1
he	1
secretly	1
suspected	1
that	1
THIS	1
CIVILITY,	1
as	1
he	1
said,	1
"was	1
all	1
show,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not,	1
nor	1
could	1
not,	1
being	1
a	1
Scotchman,	1
be	1
such	1
a	1
hearty	1
friend	1
as	1
a	1
true-born	1
Englishman."	1
Grant	1
had	1
some	1
remarkably	1
fine	1
raspberries.	1
The	1
fruit	1
was	1
so	1
large,	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
quite	1
a	1
curiosity.	1
When	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
season,	1
many	1
strangers	1
came	1
from	1
the	1
neighbouring	1
town,	1
which	1
was	1
a	1
sea-bathing	1
place,	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
these	1
raspberries,	1
which	1
obtained	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Brobdingnag	1
raspberries.	1
"How	1
came	1
you,	1
pray,	1
neighbour	1
Grant,	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
may	1
ask,	1
by	1
these	1
wonderful	1
fine	1
raspberries?"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Oakly,	1
one	1
evening,	1
to	1
the	1
gardener.	1
"That's	1
a	1
secret,"	1
replied	1
Grant,	1
with	1
an	1
arch	1
smile.	1
"Oh,	1
in	1
case	1
it's	1
a	1
secret,	1
I've	1
no	1
more	1
to	1
say;	1
for	1
I	1
never	1
meddle	1
with	1
any	1
man's	1
secrets	1
that	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
choose	1
to	1
trust	1
me	1
with.	1
But	1
I	1
wish,	1
neighbour	1
Grant,	1
you	1
would	1
put	1
down	1
that	1
book.	1
You	1
are	1
always	1
poring	1
over	1
some	1
book	1
or	1
another	1
when	1
a	1
man	1
comes	1
to	1
see	1
you,	1
which	1
is	1
not,	1
according	1
to	1
my	1
notions	1
(being	1
a	1
plain,	1
UNLARNED	1
Englishman	1
bred	1
and	1
born),	1
so	1
civil	1
and	1
neighbourly	1
as	1
might	1
be."	1
Mr.	1
Grant	1
hastily	1
shut	1
his	1
book,	1
but	1
remarked,	1
with	1
a	1
shrewd	1
glance	1
at	1
his	1
son,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
that	1
book	1
he	1
found	1
his	1
Brobdingnag	1
raspberries.	1
"You	1
are	1
pleased	1
to	1
be	1
pleasant	1
upon	1
them	1
that	1
have	1
not	1
the	1
luck	1
to	1
be	1
as	1
book-LARNED	1
as	1
yourself,	1
Mr.	1
Grant;	1
but	1
I	1
take	1
it,	1
being	1
only	1
a	1
plain	1
spoken	1
Englishman,	1
as	1
I	1
observed	1
afore,	1
that	1
one	1
is	1
to	1
the	1
full	1
as	1
like	1
to	1
find	1
a	1
raspberry	1
in	1
one's	1
garden	1
as	1
in	1
one's	1
book,	1
Mr.	1
Grant."	1
Grant,	1
observing	1
that	1
his	1
neighbour	1
spoke	1
rather	1
in	1
a	1
surly	1
tone,	1
did	1
not	1
contradict	1
him;	1
being	1
well	1
versed	1
in	1
the	1
Bible,	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
"A	1
soft	1
word	1
turneth	1
away	1
wrath,"	1
and	1
he	1
answered,	1
in	1
a	1
good	1
humoured	1
voice,	1
"I	1
hear,	1
neighbour	1
Oakly,	1
you	1
are	1
likely	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
money	1
of	1
your	1
nursery	1
this	1
year.	1
Here's	1
to	1
the	1
health	1
of	1
you	1
and	1
yours,	1
not	1
forgetting	1
the	1
seedling	1
larches,	1
which	1
I	1
see	1
are	1
coming	1
on	1
finely."	1
"Thank	1
ye,	1
neighbour,	1
kindly;	1
the	1
larches	1
are	1
coming	1
on	1
tolerably	1
well,	1
that's	1
certain;	1
and	1
here's	1
to	1
your	1
good	1
health,	1
Mr.	1
Grant--you	1
and	1
yours,	1
not	1
forgetting	1
your,	1
what	1
dye	1
call	1
'em	1
raspberries"--(drinks)--and,	1
after	1
a	1
pause,	1
resumes,	1
"I'm	1
not	1
apt	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
beggar,	1
neighbour,	1
but	1
if	1
you	1
could	1
give	1
me--"	1
Here	1
Mr.	1
Oakly	1
was	1
interrupted	1
by	1
the	1
entrance	1
of	1
some	1
strangers,	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
finish	1
making	1
his	1
request--Mr.	1
Oakly	1
was	1
not,	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
of	1
himself,	1
apt	1
to	1
ask	1
favours,	1
and	1
nothing	1
but	1
Grant's	1
cordiality	1
could	1
have	1
conquered	1
his	1
prejudices,	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
to	1
tempt	1
him	1
to	1
ask	1
a	1
favour	1
from	1
a	1
Scotchman.	1
He	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
have	1
asked	1
for	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
Brobdingnag	1
raspberry-plants.	1
The	1
next	1
day	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
raspberry-plants	1
recurred	1
to	1
his	1
memory,	1
but	1
being	1
a	1
bashful	1
man,	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
to	1
go	1
himself	1
on	1
purpose	1
to	1
make	1
his	1
request,	1
and	1
he	1
desired	1
his	1
wife,	1
who	1
was	1
just	1
setting	1
out	1
to	1
market,	1
to	1
call	1
at	1
Grant's	1
gate,	1
and,	1
if	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
work	1
in	1
his	1
garden,	1
to	1
ask	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
plants	1
of	1
his	1
raspberries.	1
The	1
answer	1
which	1
Oakly's	1
wife	1
brought	1
to	1
him	1
was	1
that	1
Mr.	1
Grant	1
had	1
not	1
a	1
raspberry-plant	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
give	1
him,	1
and	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
ever	1
so	1
many,	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
give	1
one	1
away,	1
except	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
son.	1
Oakly	1
flew	1
into	1
a	1
passion	1
when	1
he	1
received	1
such	1
a	1
message,	1
declared	1
it	1
was	1
just	1
such	1
a	1
mean,	1
shabby	1
trick	1
as	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
expected	1
from	1
a	1
Scotchman--called	1
himself	1
a	1
booby,	1
a	1
dupe,	1
and	1
a	1
blockhead,	1
for	1
ever	1
having	1
trusted	1
to	1
the	1
civil	1
speeches	1
of	1
a	1
Scotchman--swore	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
die	1
in	1
the	1
parish	1
workhouse	1
before	1
he	1
would	1
ever	1
ask	1
another	1
favour,	1
be	1
it	1
ever	1
so	1
small,	1
from	1
a	1
Scotchman;	1
related	1
to	1
his	1
wife,	1
for	1
the	1
hundredth	1
time,	1
the	1
way	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
taken	1
in	1
by	1
the	1
Scotch	1
peddler	1
ten	1
years	1
ago,	1
and	1
concluded	1
by	1
forswearing	1
all	1
further	1
intercourse	1
with	1
Mr.	1
Grant,	1
and	1
all	1
belonging	1
to	1
him.	1
"Son	1
Arthur,"	1
said	1
he,	1
addressing	1
himself	1
to	1
the	1
boy,	1
who	1
just	1
then	1
came	1
in	1
from	1
work--"Son	1
Arthur,	1
do	1
you	1
hear	1
me?	1
let	1
me	1
never	1
again	1
see	1
you	1
with	1
Grant's	1
son."	1
"With	1
Maurice,	1
father?"	1
"With	1
Maurice	1
Grant,	1
I	1
say;	1
I	1
forbid	1
you	1
from	1
this	1
day	1
and	1
hour	1
forward	1
to	1
have	1
anything	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
him."	1
"Oh,	1
why,	1
dear	1
father?"	1
"Ask	1
no	1
questions	1
but	1
do	1
as	1
I	1
bid	1
you."	1
Arthur	1
burst	1
out	1
a	1
crying,	1
and	1
only	1
said,	1
"Yes,	1
father,	1
I'll	1
do	1
as	1
you	1
bid	1
me,	1
to	1
be	1
sure."	1
"Why	1
now,	1
what	1
does	1
the	1
boy	1
cry	1
for?	1
Is	1
there	1
no	1
other	1
boy,	1
simpleton,	1
think	1
you,	1
to	1
play	1
with,	1
but	1
this	1
Scotchman's	1
son!	1
I'll	1
find	1
out	1
another	1
play-fellow	1
for	1
ye,	1
child,	1
if	1
that	1
be	1
all."	1
"That's	1
not	1
all,	1
father,"	1
said	1
Arthur,	1
trying	1
to	1
stop	1
himself	1
from	1
sobbing;	1
"but	1
the	1
thing	1
is,	1
I	1
shall	1
never	1
have	1
such	1
another	1
play-fellow,-	1
-I	1
shall	1
never	1
have	1
such	1
another	1
friend	1
as	1
Maurice	1
Grant."	1
"Like	1
father	1
like	1
son--you	1
may	1
think	1
yourself	1
well	1
off	1
to	1
have	1
done	1
with	1
him."	1
"Done	1
with	1
him!	1
Oh,	1
father,	1
and	1
shall	1
I	1
never	1
go	1
again	1
to	1
work	1
in	1
his	1
garden,	1
and	1
may	1
not	1
he	1
come	1
to	1
mine?"	1
"No,"	1
replied	1
Oakly,	1
sturdily;	1
"his	1
father	1
has	1
used	1
me	1
uncivil,	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
shall	1
use	1
me	1
uncivil	1
twice.	1
I	1
say	1
no.	1
Wife,	1
sweep	1
up	1
this	1
hearth.	1
Boy,	1
don't	1
take	1
on	1
like	1
a	1
fool;	1
but	1
eat	1
thy	1
bacon	1
and	1
greens,	1
and	1
let's	1
hear	1
no	1
more	1
of	1
Maurice	1
Grant."	1
Arthur	1
promised	1
to	1
obey	1
his	1
father.	1
He	1
only	1
begged	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
once	1
more	1
speak	1
to	1
Maurice,	1
and	1
tell	1
him	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
by	1
his	1
father's	1
orders	1
he	1
acted.	1
This	1
request	1
was	1
granted;	1
but	1
when	1
Arthur	1
further	1
begged	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
reason	1
he	1
might	1
give	1
for	1
this	1
separation,	1
his	1
father	1
refused	1
to	1
tell	1
his	1
reasons.	1
The	1
two	1
friends	1
took	1
leave	1
of	1
one	1
another	1
very	1
sorrowfully.	1
Mr.	1
Grant,	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
of	1
all	1
this,	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
discover	1
what	1
could	1
have	1
offended	1
his	1
neighbour;	1
but	1
all	1
explanation	1
was	1
prevented	1
by	1
the	1
obstinate	1
silence	1
of	1
Oakly.	1
Now,	1
the	1
message	1
which	1
Grant	1
really	1
sent	1
about	1
the	1
Brobdingnag	1
raspberries	1
was	1
somewhat	1
different	1
from	1
that	1
which	1
Mr.	1
Oakly	1
received.	1
The	1
message	1
was,	1
that	1
the	1
raspberries	1
were	1
not	1
Mr.	1
Grant's;	1
that	1
therefore	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
right	1
to	1
give	1
them	1
away;	1
that	1
they	1
belonged	1
to	1
his	1
son	1
Maurice,	1
and	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
right	1
time	1
of	1
year	1
for	1
planting	1
them.	1
This	1
message	1
had	1
been	1
unluckily	1
misunderstood.	1
Grant	1
gave	1
his	1
answer	1
to	1
his	1
wife;	1
she	1
to	1
a	1
Welsh	1
servant-girl,	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
perfectly	1
comprehend	1
her	1
mistress'	1
broad	1
Scotch;	1
and	1
she	1
in	1
her	1
turn	1
could	1
not	1
make	1
herself	1
intelligible	1
to	1
Mrs.	1
Oakly,	1
who	1
hated	1
the	1
Welsh	1
accent,	1
and	1
whose	1
attention,	1
when	1
the	1
servant-girl	1
delivered	1
the	1
message,	1
was	1
principally	1
engrossed	1
by	1
the	1
management	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
horse.	1
The	1
horse,	1
on	1
which	1
Mrs.	1
Oakly	1
rode	1
this	1
day	1
being	1
ill-broken,	1
would	1
not	1
stand	1
still	1
quietly	1
at	1
the	1
gate,	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
extremely	1
impatient	1
to	1
receive	1
her	1
answer,	1
and	1
to	1
ride	1
on	1
to	1
market.	1
Oakly,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
once	1
resolved	1
to	1
dislike	1
his	1
neighbour	1
Grant,	1
could	1
not	1
long	1
remain	1
without	1
finding	1
out	1
fresh	1
causes	1
of	1
complaint.	1
There	1
was	1
in	1
Grant's	1
garden	1
a	1
plum-tree,	1
which	1
was	1
planted	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
loose	1
stone	1
wall	1
that	1
divided	1
the	1
garden	1
from	1
the	1
nursery.	1
The	1
soil	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
plum	1
tree	1
was	1
planted	1
happened	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
quite	1
so	1
good	1
as	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
opposite	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
wall,	1
and	1
the	1
plum-tree	1
had	1
forced	1
its	1
way	1
through	1
the	1
wall,	1
and	1
gradually	1
had	1
taken	1
possession	1
of	1
the	1
ground	1
which	1
it	1
liked	1
best.	1
Oakly	1
thought	1
the	1
plum-tree,	1
as	1
it	1
belonged	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Grant,	1
had	1
no	1
right	1
to	1
make	1
its	1
appearance	1
on	1
his	1
ground:	1
an	1
attorney	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
oblige	1
Grant	1
to	1
cut	1
it	1
down;	1
but	1
Mr.	1
Grant	1
refused	1
to	1
cut	1
down	1
his	1
plum-	1
tree	1
at	1
the	1
attorney's	1
desire,	1
and	1
the	1
attorney	1
persuaded	1
Oakly	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
law	1
about	1
the	1
business,	1
and	1
the	1
lawsuit	1
went	1
on	1
for	1
some	1
months.	1
The	1
attorney,	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
this	1
time,	1
came	1
to	1
Oakly	1
with	1
a	1
demand	1
for	1
money	1
to	1
carry	1
on	1
his	1
suit,	1
assuring	1
him	1
that,	1
in	1
a	1
short	1
time,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
determined	1
in	1
his	1
favour.	1
Oakly	1
paid	1
his	1
attorney	1
ten	1
golden	1
guineas,	1
remarked	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
sum	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
pay,	1
and	1
that	1
nothing	1
but	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
justice	1
could	1
make	1
him	1
persevere	1
in	1
this	1
lawsuit	1
about	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
ground,	1
"which,	1
after	1
all,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"is	1
not	1
worth	1
twopence.	1
The	1
plum-	1
tree	1
does	1
me	1
little	1
or	1
no	1
damage,	1
but	1
I	1
don't	1
like	1
to	1
be	1
imposed	1
upon	1
by	1
a	1
Scotchman."	1
The	1
attorney	1
saw	1
and	1
took	1
advantage	1
of	1
Oakly's	1
prejudice	1
against	1
the	1
natives	1
of	1
Scotland;	1
and	1
he	1
persuaded	1
him,	1
that	1
to	1
show	1
the	1
SPIRIT	1
of	1
a	1
true-born	1
Englishman	1
it	1
was	1
necessary,	1
whatever	1
it	1
might	1
cost	1
him,	1
to	1
persist	1
in	1
this	1
law	1
suit.	1
It	1
was	1
soon	1
after	1
this	1
conversation	1
with	1
the	1
attorney	1
that	1
Mr.	1
Oakly	1
walked,	1
with	1
resolute	1
steps,	1
towards	1
the	1
plum-tree,	1
saying	1
to	1
himself,	1
"If	1
it	1
cost	1
me	1
a	1
hundred	1
pounds	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
let	1
this	1
cunning	1
Scotchman	1
get	1
the	1
better	1
of	1
me."	1
Arthur	1
interrupted	1
his	1
father's	1
reverie,	1
by	1
pointing	1
to	1
a	1
book	1
and	1
some	1
young	1
plants	1
which	1
lay	1
upon	1
the	1
wall.	1
"I	1
fancy,	1
father,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"those	1
things	1
are	1
for	1
you,	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
little	1
note	1
directed	1
to	1
you,	1
in	1
Maurice's	1
handwriting.	1
Shall	1
I	1
bring	1
it	1
to	1
you?"	1
"Yes,	1
let	1
me	1
read	1
it,	1
child,	1
since	1
I	1
must."	1
It	1
contained	1
these	1
words:	1
"DEAR	1
MR.	1
OAKLY,--I	1
don't	1
know	1
why	1
you	1
have	1
quarrelled	1
with	1
us;	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
sorry	1
for	1
it.	1
But	1
though	1
you	1
are	1
angry	1
with	1
me,	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
angry	1
with	1
you.	1
I	1
hope	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
refuse	1
some	1
of	1
my	1
Brobdingnag	1
raspberry-plants,	1
which	1
you	1
asked	1
for	1
a	1
great	1
while	1
ago,	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
all	1
good	1
friends.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
right	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
year	1
to	1
plant	1
them,	1
which	1
was	1
the	1
reason	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
sent	1
to	1
you;	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
just	1
the	1
right	1
time	1
to	1
plant	1
them	1
now;	1
and	1
I	1
send	1
you	1
the	1
book,	1
in	1
which	1
you	1
will	1
find	1
the	1
reason	1
why	1
we	1
always	1
put	1
seaweed	1
ashes	1
about	1
their	1
roots;	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
got	1
some	1
seaweed	1
ashes	1
for	1
you.	1
You	1
will	1
find	1
the	1
ashes	1
in	1
the	1
flower-pot	1
upon	1
the	1
wall.	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
spoken	1
to	1
Arthur,	1
nor	1
he	1
to	1
me,	1
since	1
you	1
bid	1
us	1
not.	1
So,	1
wishing	1
your	1
Brobdingnag	1
raspberries	1
may	1
turn	1
out	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
ours,	1
and	1
longing	1
to	1
be	1
all	1
friends	1
again,	1
I	1
am,	1
with	1
love	1
to	1
dear	1
Arthur	1
and	1
self,	1
"Your	1
affectionate	1
neighbour's	1
son,	1
"MAURICE	1
GRANT.	1
"P.S.--It	1
is	1
now	1
about	1
four	1
months	1
since	1
the	1
quarrel	1
began,	1
and	1
that	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
long	1
while."	1
A	1
great	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
effect	1
of	1
this	1
letter	1
was	1
lost	1
upon	1
Oakly,	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
very	1
expert	1
in	1
reading	1
writing,	1
and	1
it	1
cost	1
him	1
much	1
trouble	1
to	1
spell	1
it	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
together.	1
However,	1
he	1
seemed	1
affected	1
by	1
it,	1
and	1
said,	1
"I	1
believe	1
this	1
Maurice	1
loves	1
you	1
well	1
enough,	1
Arthur,	1
and	1
he	1
seems	1
a	1
good	1
sort	1
of	1
boy;	1
but	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
raspberries,	1
I	1
believe	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
says	1
about	1
them	1
is	1
but	1
an	1
excuse;	1
and,	1
at	1
anyrate,	1
as	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
get	1
'em	1
when	1
I	1
asked	1
for	1
them,	1
I'll	1
not	1
have	1
'em	1
now.	1
Do	1
you	1
hear	1
me,	1
I	1
say,	1
Arthur?	1
What	1
are	1
you	1
reading	1
there?"	1
Arthur	1
was	1
reading	1
the	1
page	1
that	1
was	1
doubled	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
book,	1
which	1
Maurice	1
had	1
left	1
along	1
with	1
the	1
raspberry-plants	1
upon	1
the	1
wall.	1
Arthur	1
read	1
aloud	1
as	1
follows:--	1
(Monthly	1
Magazine,	1
Dec.	1
'98,	1
p.	1
421.)	1
"There	1
is	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
strawberry	1
cultivated	1
at	1
Jersey,	1
which	1
is	1
almost	1
covered	1
with	1
seaweed	1
in	1
the	1
winter,	1
in	1
like	1
manner	1
as	1
many	1
plants	1
in	1
England	1
are	1
with	1
litter	1
from	1
the	1
stable.	1
These	1
strawberries	1
are	1
usually	1
of	1
the	1
largeness	1
of	1
a	1
middle-sized	1
apricot,	1
and	1
the	1
flavour	1
is	1
particularly	1
grateful.	1
In	1
Jersey	1
and	1
Guernsey,	1
situate	1
scarcely	1
one	1
degree	1
farther	1
south	1
than	1
Cornwall,	1
all	1
kinds	1
of	1
fruit,	1
pulse,	1
and	1
vegetables	1
are	1
produced	1
in	1
their	1
seasons	1
a	1
fortnight	1
or	1
three	1
weeks	1
sooner	1
than	1
in	1
England,	1
even	1
on	1
the	1
southern	1
shores;	1
and	1
snow	1
will	1
scarcely	1
remain	1
twenty-four	1
hours	1
on	1
the	1
earth.	1
Although	1
this	1
may	1
be	1
attributed	1
to	1
these	1
islands	1
being	1
surrounded	1
with	1
a	1
salt,	1
and	1
consequently	1
a	1
moist	1
atmosphere,	1
yet	1
the	1
ashes	1
(seaweed	1
ashes)	1
made	1
use	1
of	1
as	1
manure,	1
may	1
also	1
have	1
their	1
portion	1
of	1
influence."*	1
*It	1
is	1
necessary	1
to	1
observe	1
that	1
this	1
experiment	1
has	1
never	1
been	1
actually	1
tried	1
upon	1
raspberry-plants.	1
"And	1
here,"	1
continued	1
Arthur,	1
"is	1
something	1
written	1
with	1
a	1
pencil,	1
on	1
a	1
slip	1
of	1
paper,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
Maurice's	1
writing.	1
I	1
will	1
read	1
it	1
to	1
you.	1
"'When	1
I	1
read	1
in	1
this	1
book	1
what	1
is	1
said	1
about	1
the	1
strawberries	1
growing	1
as	1
large	1
as	1
apricots,	1
after	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
covered	1
over	1
with	1
seaweed,	1
I	1
thought	1
that	1
perhaps	1
seaweed	1
ashes	1
might	1
be	1
good	1
for	1
my	1
father's	1
raspberries;	1
and	1
I	1
asked	1
him	1
if	1
he	1
would	1
give	1
me	1
leave	1
to	1
try	1
them.	1
He	1
gave	1
me	1
leave,	1
and	1
I	1
went	1
directly	1
and	1
gathered	1
together	1
some	1
seaweed	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
cast	1
on	1
shore;	1
and	1
I	1
dried	1
it,	1
and	1
burned	1
it,	1
and	1
then	1
I	1
manured	1
the	1
raspberries	1
with	1
it,	1
and	1
the	1
year	1
afterwards	1
the	1
raspberries	1
grew	1
to	1
the	1
size	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
seen.	1
Now,	1
the	1
reason	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
this	1
is,	1
first,	1
that	1
you	1
may	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
manage	1
your	1
raspberries,	1
and	1
next,	1
because	1
I	1
remember	1
you	1
looked	1
very	1
grave,	1
as	1
if	1
you	1
were	1
not	1
pleased	1
with	1
my	1
father,	1
Mr.	1
Grant,	1
when	1
he	1
told	1
you	1
that	1
the	1
way	1
by	1
which	1
he	1
came	1
by	1
his	1
Brobdingnag	1
raspberries	1
was	1
a	1
secret.	1
Perhaps	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
thing	1
that	1
has	1
made	1
you	1
so	1
angry	1
with	1
us	1
all;	1
for	1
you	1
never	1
have	1
come	1
to	1
see	1
father	1
since	1
that	1
evening.	1
Now	1
I	1
have	1
told	1
you	1
all	1
I	1
know;	1
and	1
so	1
I	1
hope	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
angry	1
with	1
us	1
any	1
longer.'"	1
Mr.	1
Oakly	1
was	1
much	1
pleased	1
by	1
this	1
openness,	1
and	1
said,	1
"Why	1
now,	1
Arthur,	1
this	1
is	1
something	1
like,	1
this	1
is	1
telling	1
one	1
the	1
thing	1
one	1
wants	1
to	1
know,	1
without	1
fine	1
speeches.	1
This	1
is	1
like	1
an	1
Englishman	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
Scotchman.	1
Pray,	1
Arthur,	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
whether	1
your	1
friend	1
Maurice	1
was	1
born	1
in	1
England	1
or	1
in	1
Scotland?"	1
"No,	1
indeed,	1
sir,	1
I	1
don't	1
know--I	1
never	1
asked--I	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
it	1
signified.	1
All	1
I	1
know	1
is,	1
that	1
wherever	1
he	1
was	1
born,	1
he	1
is	1
VERY	1
good.	1
Look,	1
papa,	1
my	1
tulip	1
is	1
blowing."	1
"Upon	1
my	1
word,"	1
said	1
his	1
father,	1
"this	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
beautiful	1
tulip!"	1
"It	1
was	1
given	1
to	1
me	1
by	1
Maurice."	1
"And	1
did	1
you	1
give	1
him	1
nothing	1
for	1
it?"	1
was	1
the	1
father's	1
inquiry.	1
"Nothing	1
in	1
the	1
world;	1
and	1
he	1
gave	1
it	1
to	1
me	1
just	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
good	1
cause	1
to	1
be	1
angry	1
with	1
me,	1
just	1
when	1
I	1
had	1
broken	1
his	1
bell-glass."	1
"I	1
have	1
a	1
great	1
mind	1
to	1
let	1
you	1
play	1
together	1
again,"	1
said	1
Arthur's	1
father.	1
"Oh,	1
if	1
you	1
would,"	1
cried	1
Arthur,	1
clapping	1
his	1
hands,	1
"how	1
happy	1
we	1
should	1
be!	1
Do	1
you	1
know,	1
father,	1
I	1
have	1
often	1
sat	1
for	1
an	1
hour	1
at	1
a	1
time	1
up	1
in	1
that	1
crab-tree,	1
looking	1
at	1
Maurice	1
at	1
work	1
in	1
his	1
garden,	1
and	1
wishing	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
at	1
work	1
with	1
him."	1
Here	1
Arthur	1
was	1
interrupted	1
by	1
the	1
attorney,	1
who	1
came	1
to	1
ask	1
Mr.	1
Oakly	1
some	1
question	1
about	1
the	1
lawsuit	1
concerning	1
the	1
plum-tree.	1
Oakly	1
showed	1
him	1
Maurice's	1
letter;	1
and	1
to	1
Arthur's	1
extreme	1
astonishment,	1
the	1
attorney	1
had	1
no	1
sooner	1
read	1
it,	1
than	1
he	1
exclaimed,	1
"What	1
an	1
artful	1
little	1
gentleman	1
this	1
is!	1
I	1
never,	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
all	1
my	1
practice,	1
met	1
with	1
anything	1
better.	1
Why,	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
most	1
cunning	1
letter	1
I	1
ever	1
read."	1
"Where's	1
the	1
cunning?"	1
said	1
Oakly,	1
and	1
he	1
put	1
on	1
his	1
spectacles.	1
"My	1
good	1
sir,	1
don't	1
you	1
see,	1
that	1
all	1
this	1
stuff	1
about	1
Brobdingnag	1
raspberries	1
is	1
to	1
ward	1
off	1
your	1
suit	1
about	1
the	1
plum-tree?	1
They	1
know--	1
that	1
is,	1
Mr.	1
Grant,	1
who	1
is	1
sharp	1
enough,	1
knows--that	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
worsted	1
in	1
that	1
suit;	1
that	1
he	1
must,	1
in	1
short,	1
pay	1
you	1
a	1
good	1
round	1
sum	1
for	1
damages,	1
if	1
it	1
goes	1
on--"	1
"Damages!"	1
said	1
Oakly,	1
staring	1
round	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
plum-tree;	1
"but	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
what	1
you	1
mean.	1
I	1
mean	1
nothing	1
but	1
what's	1
honest.	1
I	1
don't	1
mean	1
to	1
ask	1
for	1
any	1
good	1
round	1
sum;	1
for	1
the	1
plum-tree	1
has	1
done	1
me	1
no	1
great	1
harm	1
by	1
coming	1
into	1
my	1
garden;	1
but	1
only	1
I	1
don't	1
choose	1
it	1
should	1
come	1
there	1
without	1
my	1
leave."	1
"Well,	1
well,"	1
said	1
the	1
attorney,	1
"I	1
understand	1
all	1
that;	1
but	1
what	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
make	1
you,	1
Mr.	1
Oakly,	1
understand,	1
is,	1
that	1
this	1
Grant	1
and	1
his	1
son	1
only	1
want	1
to	1
make	1
up	1
matters	1
with	1
you,	1
and	1
prevent	1
the	1
thing's	1
coming	1
to	1
a	1
fair	1
trial,	1
by	1
sending	1
on,	1
in	1
this	1
underhand	1
sort	1
of	1
way,	1
a	1
bribe	1
of	1
a	1
few	1
raspberries."	1
"A	1
bribe!"	1
exclaimed	1
Oakly,	1
"I	1
never	1
took	1
a	1
bribe,	1
and	1
I	1
never	1
will";	1
and,	1
with	1
sudden	1
indignation,	1
he	1
pulled	1
the	1
raspberry	1
plants	1
from	1
the	1
ground	1
in	1
which	1
Arthur	1
was	1
planting	1
them;	1
and	1
he	1
threw	1
them	1
over	1
the	1
wall	1
into	1
Grant's	1
garden.	1
Maurice	1
had	1
put	1
his	1
tulip,	1
which	1
was	1
beginning	1
to	1
blow,	1
in	1
a	1
flower-pot,	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
wall,	1
in	1
hopes	1
that	1
his	1
friend	1
Arthur	1
would	1
see	1
it	1
from	1
day	1
to	1
day.	1
Alas!	1
he	1
knew	1
not	1
in	1
what	1
a	1
dangerous	1
situation	1
he	1
had	1
placed	1
it.	1
One	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
Brobdingnag	1
raspberry-plants,	1
swung	1
by	1
the	1
angry	1
arm	1
of	1
Oakly,	1
struck	1
off	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
his	1
precious	1
tulip!	1
Arthur,	1
who	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
convincing	1
his	1
father	1
that	1
the	1
attorney	1
was	1
mistaken	1
in	1
his	1
judgment	1
of	1
poor	1
Maurice,	1
did	1
not	1
observe	1
the	1
fall	1
of	1
the	1
tulip.	1
The	1
next	1
day,	1
when	1
Maurice	1
saw	1
his	1
raspberry-plants	1
scattered	1
upon	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
his	1
favourite	1
tulip	1
broken,	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
much	1
astonishment,	1
and,	1
for	1
some	1
moments,	1
angry;	1
but	1
anger,	1
with	1
him,	1
never	1
lasted	1
long.	1
He	1
was	1
convinced	1
that	1
all	1
this	1
must	1
be	1
owing	1
to	1
some	1
accident	1
or	1
mistake.	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
believe	1
that	1
anyone	1
could	1
be	1
so	1
malicious	1
as	1
to	1
injure	1
him	1
on	1
purpose--"And	1
even	1
if	1
they	1
did	1
all	1
this	1
on	1
purpose	1
to	1
vex	1
me,"	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
himself,	1
"the	1
best	1
thing	1
I	1
can	1
do,	1
is,	1
not	1
to	1
let	1
it	1
vex	1
me.	1
Forgive	1
and	1
forget."	1
This	1
temper	1
of	1
mind	1
Maurice	1
was	1
more	1
happy	1
in	1
enjoying	1
than	1
he	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
made,	1
without	1
it,	1
by	1
the	1
possession	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
tulips	1
in	1
Holland.	1
Tulips	1
were,	1
at	1
this	1
time,	1
things	1
of	1
great	1
consequence	1
in	1
the	1
estimation	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
several	1
miles	1
round	1
where	1
Maurice	1
and	1
Arthur	1
lived.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
florist's	1
feast	1
to	1
be	1
held	1
at	1
the	1
neighbouring	1
town,	1
at	1
which	1
a	1
prize	1
of	1
a	1
handsome	1
set	1
of	1
gardening-tools	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
given	1
to	1
the	1
person	1
who	1
could	1
produce	1
the	1
finest	1
flower	1
of	1
its	1
kind.	1
A	1
tulip	1
was	1
the	1
flower	1
which	1
was	1
thought	1
the	1
finest	1
the	1
preceding	1
year,	1
and	1
consequently	1
numbers	1
of	1
people	1
afterwards	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
procure	1
tulip-roots,	1
in	1
hopes	1
of	1
obtaining	1
the	1
prize	1
this	1
year.	1
Arthur's	1
tulip	1
was	1
beautiful.	1
As	1
he	1
examined	1
it	1
from	1
day	1
to	1
day,	1
and	1
every	1
day	1
thought	1
it	1
improving,	1
he	1
longed	1
to	1
thank	1
his	1
friend	1
Maurice	1
for	1
it;	1
and	1
he	1
often	1
mounted	1
into	1
his	1
crab-tree,	1
to	1
look	1
into	1
Maurice's	1
garden,	1
in	1
hopes	1
of	1
seeing	1
his	1
tulip	1
also	1
in	1
full	1
bloom	1
and	1
beauty.	1
He	1
never	1
could	1
see	1
it.	1
The	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
florist's	1
feast	1
arrived,	1
and	1
Oakly	1
went	1
with	1
his	1
son	1
and	1
the	1
fine	1
tulip	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
meeting.	1
It	1
was	1
on	1
a	1
spacious	1
bowling-	1
green.	1
All	1
the	1
flowers	1
of	1
various	1
sorts	1
were	1
ranged	1
upon	1
a	1
terrace	1
at	1
the	1
upper	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
bowling-green;	1
and,	1
amongst	1
all	1
this	1
gay	1
variety,	1
the	1
tulip	1
which	1
Maurice	1
had	1
given	1
to	1
Arthur	1
appeared	1
conspicuously	1
beautiful.	1
To	1
the	1
owner	1
of	1
this	1
tulip	1
the	1
prize	1
was	1
adjudged;	1
and,	1
as	1
the	1
handsome	1
garden-tools	1
were	1
delivered	1
to	1
Arthur,	1
he	1
heard	1
a	1
well	1
known	1
voice	1
wish	1
him	1
joy.	1
He	1
turned,	1
looked	1
about	1
him,	1
and	1
saw	1
his	1
friend	1
Maurice.	1
"But,	1
Maurice,	1
where	1
is	1
your	1
own	1
tulip?"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Oakly;	1
"I	1
thought,	1
Arthur,	1
you	1
told	1
me	1
that	1
he	1
kept	1
one	1
for	1
himself."	1
"So	1
I	1
did,"	1
said	1
Maurice;	1
"but	1
somebody	1
(I	1
suppose	1
by	1
accident)	1
broke	1
it."	1
"Somebody!	1
who?"	1
cried	1
Arthur	1
and	1
Mr.	1
Oakly	1
at	1
once.	1
"Somebody	1
who	1
threw	1
the	1
raspberry-plants	1
back	1
again	1
over	1
the	1
wall,"	1
replied	1
Maurice.	1
"That	1
was	1
me--that	1
somebody	1
was	1
me,"	1
said	1
Oakly.	1
"I	1
scorn	1
to	1
deny	1
it;	1
but	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
intend	1
to	1
break	1
your	1
tulip,	1
Maurice."	1
"Dear	1
Maurice,"	1
said	1
Arthur--"you	1
know	1
I	1
may	1
call	1
him	1
dear	1
Maurice--now	1
you	1
are	1
by,	1
papa;	1
here	1
are	1
all	1
the	1
garden-tools;	1
take	1
them,	1
and	1
welcome."	1
"Not	1
one	1
of	1
them,"	1
said	1
Maurice,	1
drawing	1
back.	1
"Offer	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
father--offer	1
them	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Grant,"	1
whispered	1
Oakly;	1
"he'll	1
take	1
them,	1
I'll	1
answer	1
for	1
it."	1
Mr.	1
Oakly	1
was	1
mistaken:	1
the	1
father	1
would	1
not	1
accept	1
of	1
the	1
tools.	1
Mr.	1
Oakly	1
stood	1
surprised--"Certainly,"	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
himself,	1
"this	1
cannot	1
be	1
such	1
a	1
miser	1
as	1
I	1
took	1
him	1
for";	1
and	1
he	1
walked	1
immediately	1
up	1
to	1
Grant,	1
and	1
bluntly	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
"Mr.	1
Grant,	1
your	1
son	1
has	1
behaved	1
very	1
handsomely	1
to	1
my	1
son;	1
and	1
you	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
glad	1
of	1
it."	1
"To	1
be	1
sure	1
I	1
am,"	1
said	1
Grant	1
"Which,"	1
continued	1
Oakly,	1
"gives	1
me	1
a	1
better	1
opinion	1
of	1
you	1
than	1
ever	1
I	1
had	1
before--I	1
mean,	1
than	1
ever	1
I	1
had	1
since	1
the	1
day	1
you	1
sent	1
me	1
the	1
shabby	1
answer	1
about	1
those	1
foolish,	1
what	1
d'ye	1
call	1
em,	1
cursed	1
raspberries."	1
"What	1
shabby	1
answer?"	1
said	1
Grant,	1
with	1
surprise;	1
and	1
Oakly	1
repeated	1
exactly	1
the	1
message	1
which	1
he	1
received;	1
and	1
Grant	1
declared	1
that	1
he	1
never	1
sent	1
any	1
such	1
message.	1
He	1
repeated	1
exactly	1
the	1
answer	1
which	1
he	1
really	1
sent,	1
and	1
Oakly	1
immediately	1
stretched	1
out	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
him,	1
saying	1
"I	1
believe	1
you:	1
no	1
more	1
need	1
be	1
said.	1
I'm	1
only	1
sorry	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
ask	1
you	1
about	1
this	1
four	1
months	1
ago;	1
and	1
so	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
done	1
if	1
you	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
a	1
Scotchman.	1
Till	1
now,	1
I	1
never	1
rightly	1
liked	1
a	1
Scotchman.	1
We	1
may	1
thank	1
this	1
good	1
little	1
fellow,"	1
continued	1
he,	1
turning	1
to	1
Maurice,	1
"for	1
our	1
coming	1
at	1
last	1
to	1
a	1
right	1
understanding.	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
holding	1
out	1
against	1
his	1
good	1
nature.	1
I'm	1
sure,	1
from	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
my	1
heart,	1
I'm	1
sorry	1
I	1
broke	1
his	1
tulip.	1
Shake	1
hands,	1
boys;	1
I'm	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
you,	1
Arthur,	1
look	1
so	1
happy	1
again,	1
and	1
hope	1
Mr.	1
Grant	1
will	1
forgive--"	1
"Oh,	1
forgive	1
and	1
forget,"	1
said	1
Grant	1
and	1
his	1
son	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
moment.	1
And	1
from	1
this	1
time	1
forward	1
the	1
two	1
families	1
lived	1
in	1
friendship	1
with	1
each	1
other.	1
Oakly	1
laughed	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
folly,	1
in	1
having	1
been	1
persuaded	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
law	1
about	1
the	1
plum-tree;	1
and	1
he,	1
in	1
process	1
of	1
time,	1
so	1
completely	1
conquered	1
his	1
early	1
prejudice	1
against	1
Scotchmen,	1
that	1
he	1
and	1
Grant	1
became	1
partners	1
in	1
business.	1
Mr.	1
Grant's	1
book-LARNING	1
and	1
knowledge	1
of	1
arithmetic	1
he	1
found	1
highly	1
useful	1
to	1
him;	1
and	1
he,	1
on	1
his	1
side,	1
possessed	1
a	1
great	1
many	1
active,	1
good	1
qualities,	1
which	1
became	1
serviceable	1
to	1
his	1
partner.	1
The	1
two	1
boys	1
rejoiced	1
in	1
this	1
family	1
union;	1
and	1
Arthur	1
often	1
declared	1
that	1
they	1
owed	1
all	1
their	1
happiness	1
to	1
Maurice's	1
favourite	1
maxim,	1
"Forgive	1
and	1
Forget."	1
WASTE	1
NOT,	1
WANT	1
NOT;	1
or	1
TWO	1
STRINGS	1
TO	1
YOUR	1
BOW.	1
Mr.	1
Gresham,	1
a	1
Bristol	1
merchant,	1
who	1
had,	1
by	1
honourable	1
industry	1
and	1
economy,	1
accumulated	1
a	1
considerable	1
fortune,	1
retired	1
from	1
business	1
to	1
a	1
new	1
house	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
built	1
upon	1
the	1
Downs,	1
near	1
Clifton.	1
Mr.	1
Gresham,	1
however,	1
did	1
not	1
imagine	1
that	1
a	1
new	1
house	1
alone	1
could	1
make	1
him	1
happy.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
propose	1
to	1
live	1
in	1
idleness	1
and	1
extravagance;	1
for	1
such	1
a	1
life	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
equally	1
incompatible	1
with	1
his	1
habits	1
and	1
his	1
principles.	1
He	1
was	1
fond	1
of	1
children;	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
sons,	1
he	1
determined	1
to	1
adopt	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
relations.	1
He	1
had	1
two	1
nephews,	1
and	1
he	1
invited	1
both	1
of	1
them	1
to	1
his	1
house,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
an	1
opportunity	1
of	1
judging	1
of	1
their	1
dispositions,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
habits	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
acquired.	1
Hal	1
and	1
Benjamin,	1
Mr.	1
Gresham's	1
nephews,	1
were	1
about	1
ten	1
years	1
old.	1
They	1
had	1
been	1
educated	1
very	1
differently.	1
Hal	1
was	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
the	1
elder	1
branch	1
of	1
the	1
family.	1
His	1
father	1
was	1
a	1
gentleman,	1
who	1
spent	1
rather	1
more	1
than	1
he	1
could	1
afford;	1
and	1
Hal,	1
from	1
the	1
example	1
of	1
the	1
servants	1
in	1
his	1
father's	1
family,	1
with	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
passed	1
the	1
first	1
years	1
of	1
his	1
childhood,	1
learned	1
to	1
waste	1
more	1
of	1
everything	1
than	1
he	1
used.	1
He	1
had	1
been	1
told	1
that	1
"gentlemen	1
should	1
be	1
above	1
being	1
careful	1
and	1
saving":	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
unfortunately	1
imbibed	1
a	1
notion	1
that	1
extravagance	1
was	1
the	1
sign	1
of	1
a	1
generous	1
disposition,	1
and	1
economy	1
of	1
an	1
avaricious	1
one.	1
Benjamin,	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
had	1
been	1
taught	1
habits	1
of	1
care	1
and	1
foresight.	1
His	1
father	1
had	1
but	1
a	1
very	1
small	1
fortune,	1
and	1
was	1
anxious	1
that	1
his	1
son	1
should	1
early	1
learn	1
that	1
economy	1
ensures	1
independence,	1
and	1
sometimes	1
puts	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
not	1
very	1
rich	1
to	1
be	1
very	1
generous.	1
The	1
morning	1
after	1
these	1
two	1
boys	1
arrived	1
at	1
their	1
uncle's	1
they	1
were	1
eager	1
to	1
see	1
all	1
the	1
rooms	1
in	1
the	1
house.	1
Mr.	1
Gresham	1
accompanied	1
them,	1
and	1
attended	1
to	1
their	1
remarks	1
and	1
exclamations.	1
"Oh!	1
what	1
an	1
excellent	1
motto!"	1
exclaimed	1
Ben,	1
when	1
he	1
read	1
the	1
following	1
words,	1
which	1
were	1
written	1
in	1
large	1
characters	1
over	1
the	1
chimney-piece,	1
in	1
his	1
uncle's	1
spacious	1
kitchen--	1
"WASTE	1
NOT,	1
WANT	1
NOT."	1
"'Waste	1
not,	1
want	1
not!'"	1
repeated	1
his	1
cousin	1
Hal,	1
in	1
rather	1
a	1
contemptuous	1
tone;	1
"I	1
think	1
it	1
looks	1
stingy	1
to	1
servants;	1
and	1
no	1
gentleman's	1
servants,	1
cooks	1
especially,	1
would	1
like	1
to	1
have	1
such	1
a	1
mean	1
motto	1
always	1
staring	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
face."	1
Ben,	1
who	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
conversant	1
as	1
his	1
cousin	1
in	1
the	1
ways	1
of	1
cooks	1
and	1
gentlemen's	1
servants,	1
made	1
no	1
reply	1
to	1
these	1
observations.	1
Mr.	1
Gresham	1
was	1
called	1
away	1
whilst	1
his	1
nephews	1
were	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
rooms	1
in	1
the	1
house.	1
Some	1
time	1
afterwards,	1
he	1
heard	1
their	1
voices	1
in	1
the	1
hall.	1
"Boys,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"what	1
are	1
you	1
doing	1
there?"	1
"Nothing,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
Hal;	1
"you	1
were	1
called	1
away	1
from	1
us	1
and	1
we	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
which	1
way	1
to	1
go."	1
"And	1
have	1
you	1
nothing	1
to	1
do?"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Gresham.	1
"No,	1
sir,	1
nothing,"	1
answered	1
Hal,	1
in	1
a	1
careless	1
tone,	1
like	1
one	1
who	1
was	1
well	1
content	1
with	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
habitual	1
idleness.	1
"No,	1
sir,	1
nothing!"	1
replied	1
Ben,	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
of	1
lamentation.	1
"Come,"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Gresham,	1
"if	1
you	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
do,	1
lads,	1
will	1
you	1
unpack	1
those	1
two	1
parcels	1
for	1
me?"	1
The	1
two	1
parcels	1
were	1
exactly	1
alike,	1
both	1
of	1
them	1
well	1
tied	1
up	1
with	1
good	1
whip	1
cord.	1
Ben	1
took	1
his	1
parcel	1
to	1
a	1
table,	1
and,	1
after	1
breaking	1
off	1
the	1
sealing	1
wax,	1
began	1
carefully	1
to	1
examine	1
the	1
knot,	1
and	1
then	1
to	1
untie	1
it.	1
Hal	1
stood	1
still,	1
exactly	1
in	1
the	1
spot	1
where	1
the	1
parcel	1
was	1
put	1
into	1
his	1
hands,	1
and	1
tried	1
first	1
at	1
one	1
corner,	1
and	1
then	1
at	1
another,	1
to	1
pull	1
the	1
string	1
off	1
by	1
force.	1
"I	1
wish	1
these	1
people	1
wouldn't	1
tie	1
up	1
their	1
parcels	1
so	1
tight,	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
never	1
to	1
be	1
undone,"	1
cried	1
he,	1
as	1
he	1
tugged	1
at	1
the	1
cord;	1
and	1
he	1
pulled	1
the	1
knot	1
closer	1
instead	1
of	1
loosening	1
it.	1
"Ben!	1
why,	1
how	1
did	1
you	1
get	1
yours	1
undone,	1
man?	1
what's	1
in	1
your	1
parcel?--I	1
wonder	1
what	1
is	1
in	1
mine!	1
I	1
wish	1
I	1
could	1
get	1
this	1
string	1
off--I	1
must	1
cut	1
it."	1
"Oh,	1
no,"	1
said	1
Ben,	1
who	1
now	1
had	1
undone	1
the	1
last	1
knot	1
of	1
his	1
parcel,	1
and	1
who	1
drew	1
out	1
the	1
length	1
of	1
string	1
with	1
exultation,	1
"don't	1
cut	1
it,	1
Hal,--	1
look	1
what	1
a	1
nice	1
cord	1
this	1
is,	1
and	1
yours	1
is	1
the	1
same:	1
it's	1
a	1
pity	1
to	1
cut	1
it;	1
'WASTE	1
NOT,	1
WANT	1
NOT!'	1
you	1
know."	1
"Pooh!"	1
said	1
Hal,	1
"what	1
signifies	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
packthread?"	1
"It	1
is	1
whip	1
cord,"	1
said	1
Ben.	1
"Well,	1
whip	1
cord!	1
what	1
signifies	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
whip	1
cord!	1
you	1
can	1
get	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
whip	1
cord	1
twice	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
that	1
for	1
twopence;	1
and	1
who	1
cares	1
for	1
twopence!	1
Not	1
I,	1
for	1
one!	1
so	1
here	1
it	1
goes,"	1
cried	1
Hal,	1
drawing	1
out	1
his	1
knife;	1
and	1
he	1
cut	1
the	1
cord,	1
precipitately,	1
in	1
sundry	1
places.	1
"Lads!	1
have	1
you	1
undone	1
the	1
parcels	1
for	1
me?"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Gresham,	1
opening	1
the	1
parlour	1
door	1
as	1
he	1
spoke.	1
"Yes,	1
sir,"	1
cried	1
Hal;	1
and	1
he	1
dragged	1
off	1
his	1
half	1
cut,	1
half	1
entangled	1
string--"here's	1
the	1
parcel."	1
"And	1
here's	1
my	1
parcel,	1
uncle;	1
and	1
here's	1
the	1
string,"	1
said	1
Ben.	1
"You	1
may	1
keep	1
the	1
string	1
for	1
your	1
pains,"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Gresham.	1
"Thank	1
you,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
Ben:	1
"what	1
an	1
excellent	1
whip	1
cord	1
it	1
is!"	1
"And	1
you,	1
Hal,"	1
continued	1
Mr.	1
Gresham,	1
"you	1
may	1
keep	1
your	1
string	1
too,	1
if	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
of	1
any	1
use	1
to	1
you."	1
"It	1
will	1
be	1
of	1
no	1
use	1
to	1
me,	1
thank	1
you,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
Hal.	1
"No,	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
not,	1
if	1
this	1
be	1
it,"	1
said	1
his	1
uncle,	1
taking	1
up	1
the	1
jagged	1
knotted	1
remains	1
of	1
Hal's	1
cord.	1
A	1
few	1
days	1
after	1
this,	1
Mr.	1
Gresham	1
gave	1
to	1
each	1
of	1
his	1
nephews	1
a	1
new	1
top.	1
"But	1
how's	1
this?"	1
said	1
Hal;	1
"these	1
tops	1
have	1
no	1
strings;	1
what	1
shall	1
we	1
do	1
for	1
strings?"	1
"I	1
have	1
a	1
string	1
that	1
will	1
do	1
very	1
well	1
for	1
mine,"	1
said	1
Ben;	1
and	1
he	1
pulled	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
pocket	1
the	1
fine,	1
long,	1
smooth	1
string,	1
which	1
had	1
tied	1
up	1
the	1
parcel.	1
With	1
this	1
he	1
soon	1
set	1
up	1
his	1
top,	1
which	1
spun	1
admirably	1
well.	1
"Oh,	1
how	1
I	1
wish	1
I	1
had	1
but	1
a	1
string,"	1
said	1
Hal.	1
"What	1
shall	1
I	1
do	1
for	1
a	1
string?	1
I'll	1
tell	1
you	1
what,	1
I	1
can	1
use	1
the	1
string	1
that	1
goes	1
round	1
my	1
hat!"	1
"But	1
then,"	1
said	1
Ben,	1
"what	1
will	1
you	1
do	1
for	1
a	1
hat-band?"	1
"I'll	1
manage	1
to	1
do	1
without	1
one,"	1
said	1
Hal,	1
and	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
string	1
of	1
his	1
hat	1
for	1
his	1
top.	1
It	1
soon	1
was	1
worn	1
through,	1
and	1
he	1
split	1
his	1
top	1
by	1
driving	1
the	1
pea	1
too	1
tightly	1
into	1
it.	1
His	1
cousin	1
Ben	1
let	1
him	1
set	1
up	1
his	1
the	1
next	1
day;	1
but	1
Hal	1
was	1
not	1
more	1
fortunate	1
or	1
more	1
careful	1
when	1
he	1
meddled	1
with	1
other	1
people's	1
things	1
than	1
when	1
he	1
managed	1
his	1
own.	1
He	1
had	1
scarcely	1
played	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
before	1
he	1
split	1
it,	1
by	1
driving	1
the	1
peg	1
too	1
violently.	1
Ben	1
bore	1
this	1
misfortune	1
with	1
good	1
humour.	1
"Come,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"it	1
can't	1
be	1
helped;	1
but	1
give	1
me	1
the	1
string	1
because	1
THAT	1
may	1
still	1
be	1
of	1
use	1
for	1
something	1
else."	1
It	1
happened	1
some	1
time	1
afterwards	1
that	1
a	1
lady,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
intimately	1
acquainted	1
with	1
Hal's	1
mother	1
at	1
Bath--that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
who	1
had	1
frequently	1
met	1
her	1
at	1
the	1
card-table	1
during	1
the	1
winter--now	1
arrived	1
at	1
Clifton.	1
She	1
was	1
informed	1
by	1
his	1
mother	1
that	1
Hal	1
was	1
at	1
Mr.	1
Gresham's,	1
and	1
her	1
sons,	1
who	1
were	1
FRIENDS	1
of	1
his,	1
came	1
to	1
see	1
him,	1
and	1
invited	1
him	1
to	1
spend	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
with	1
them.	1
Hal	1
joyfully	1
accepted	1
the	1
invitation.	1
He	1
was	1
always	1
glad	1
to	1
go	1
out	1
to	1
dine,	1
because	1
it	1
gave	1
him	1
something	1
to	1
do,	1
something	1
to	1
think	1
of,	1
or	1
at	1
least	1
something	1
to	1
say.	1
Besides	1
this,	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
educated	1
to	1
think	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
fine	1
thing	1
to	1
visit	1
fine	1
people;	1
and	1
Lady	1
Diana	1
Sweepstakes	1
(for	1
that	1
was	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
his	1
mother's	1
acquaintance)	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
fine	1
lady,	1
and	1
her	1
two	1
sons	1
intended	1
to	1
be	1
very	1
great	1
gentlemen.	1
He	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
prodigious	1
hurry	1
when	1
these	1
young	1
gentlemen	1
knocked	1
at	1
his	1
uncle's	1
door	1
the	1
next	1
day;	1
but	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
got	1
to	1
the	1
hall	1
door,	1
little	1
Patty	1
called	1
to	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
stairs,	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
dropped	1
his	1
pocket-	1
handkerchief.	1
"Pick	1
it	1
up,	1
then,	1
and	1
bring	1
it	1
to	1
me,	1
quick,	1
can't	1
you,	1
child,"	1
cried	1
Hal,	1
"for	1
Lady	1
Di's	1
sons	1
are	1
waiting	1
for	1
me?"	1
Little	1
Patty	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
anything	1
about	1
Lady	1
Di's	1
sons;	1
but	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
very	1
good-natured,	1
and	1
saw	1
that	1
her	1
cousin	1
Hal	1
was,	1
for	1
some	1
reason	1
or	1
other,	1
in	1
a	1
desperate	1
hurry,	1
she	1
ran	1
downstairs	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
she	1
possibly	1
could	1
towards	1
the	1
landing-place,	1
where	1
the	1
handkerchief	1
lay;	1
but,	1
alas!	1
before	1
she	1
reached	1
the	1
handkerchief,	1
she	1
fell,	1
rolling	1
down	1
a	1
whole	1
flight	1
of	1
stairs,	1
and	1
when	1
her	1
fall	1
was	1
at	1
last	1
stopped	1
by	1
the	1
landing-	1
place,	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
cry	1
out,	1
she	1
writhed,	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
great	1
pain.	1
"Where	1
are	1
you	1
hurt,	1
my	1
love?"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Gresham,	1
who	1
came	1
instantly,	1
on	1
hearing	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
someone	1
falling	1
downstairs.	1
"Where	1
are	1
you	1
hurt,	1
my	1
dear?"	1
"Here,	1
papa,"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
girl,	1
touching	1
her	1
ankle,	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
decently	1
covered	1
with	1
her	1
gown.	1
"I	1
believe	1
I	1
am	1
hurt	1
here,	1
but	1
not	1
much,"	1
added	1
she,	1
trying	1
to	1
rise;	1
"only	1
it	1
hurts	1
me	1
when	1
I	1
move."	1
"I'll	1
carry	1
you;	1
don't	1
move	1
then,"	1
said	1
her	1
father,	1
and	1
he	1
took	1
her	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
arms.	1
"My	1
shoe!	1
I've	1
lost	1
one	1
of	1
my	1
shoes,"	1
said	1
she.	1
Ben	1
looked	1
for	1
it	1
upon	1
the	1
stairs,	1
and	1
he	1
found	1
it	1
sticking	1
in	1
a	1
loop	1
of	1
whip	1
cord,	1
which	1
was	1
entangled	1
round	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
bannisters.	1
When	1
this	1
cord	1
was	1
drawn	1
forth,	1
it	1
appeared	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
very	1
same	1
jagged,	1
entangled	1
piece	1
which	1
Hal	1
had	1
pulled	1
off	1
his	1
parcel.	1
He	1
had	1
diverted	1
himself	1
with	1
running	1
up	1
and	1
downstairs,	1
whipping	1
the	1
bannisters	1
with	1
it,	1
as	1
he	1
thought	1
he	1
could	1
convert	1
it	1
to	1
no	1
better	1
use;	1
and,	1
with	1
his	1
usual	1
carelessness,	1
he	1
at	1
last	1
left	1
it	1
hanging	1
just	1
where	1
he	1
happened	1
to	1
throw	1
it	1
when	1
the	1
dinner	1
bell	1
rang.	1
Poor	1
little	1
Patty's	1
ankle	1
was	1
terribly	1
strained,	1
and	1
Hal	1
reproached	1
himself	1
for	1
his	1
folly,	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
reproached	1
himself	1
longer,	1
perhaps,	1
if	1
Lady	1
Di	1
Sweepstakes'	1
sons	1
had	1
not	1
hurried	1
him	1
away.	1
In	1
the	1
evening,	1
Patty	1
could	1
not	1
run	1
about	1
as	1
she	1
used	1
to	1
do;	1
but	1
she	1
sat	1
upon	1
the	1
sofa,	1
and	1
she	1
said,	1
that	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
feel	1
the	1
pain	1
of	1
her	1
ankle	1
SO	1
MUCH,	1
whilst	1
Ben	1
was	1
so	1
good	1
as	1
to	1
play	1
at	1
JACK	1
STRAWS	1
with	1
her.	1
"That's	1
right,	1
Ben;	1
never	1
be	1
ashamed	1
of	1
being	1
good-natured	1
to	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
younger	1
and	1
weaker	1
than	1
yourself,"	1
said	1
his	1
uncle,	1
smiling	1
at	1
seeing	1
him	1
produce	1
his	1
whip	1
cord,	1
to	1
indulge	1
his	1
little	1
cousin	1
with	1
a	1
game	1
at	1
her	1
favourite	1
cat's	1
cradle.	1
"I	1
shall	1
not	1
think	1
you	1
one	1
bit	1
less	1
manly,	1
because	1
I	1
see	1
you	1
playing	1
at	1
cat's	1
cradle	1
with	1
a	1
little	1
child	1
of	1
six	1
years	1
old."	1
Hal,	1
however,	1
was	1
not	1
precisely	1
of	1
his	1
uncle's	1
opinion:	1
for	1
when	1
he	1
returned	1
in	1
the	1
evening,	1
and	1
saw	1
Ben	1
playing	1
with	1
his	1
little	1
cousin,	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
smiling	1
contemptuously,	1
and	1
asked	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
playing	1
at	1
cat's	1
cradle	1
all	1
night.	1
In	1
a	1
heedless	1
manner	1
he	1
made	1
some	1
inquiries	1
after	1
Patty's	1
sprained	1
ankle,	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
ran	1
on	1
to	1
tell	1
all	1
the	1
news	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
at	1
Lady	1
Diana	1
Sweepstakes'--news	1
which	1
he	1
thought	1
would	1
make	1
him	1
appear	1
a	1
person	1
of	1
vast	1
importance.	1
"Do	1
you	1
know,	1
uncle--do	1
you	1
know,	1
Ben,"	1
said	1
he--"there's	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
most	1
FAMOUS	1
doings	1
that	1
ever	1
were	1
heard	1
of	1
upon	1
the	1
Downs	1
here,	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
of	1
next	1
month,	1
which	1
will	1
be	1
in	1
a	1
fortnight,	1
thank	1
my	1
stars!	1
I	1
wish	1
the	1
fortnight	1
was	1
over;	1
I	1
shall	1
think	1
of	1
nothing	1
else,	1
I	1
know,	1
till	1
that	1
happy	1
day	1
comes!"	1
Mr.	1
Gresham	1
inquired	1
why	1
the	1
first	1
of	1
September	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
much	1
happier	1
than	1
any	1
other	1
day	1
in	1
the	1
year.	1
"Why,"	1
replied	1
Hal,	1
"Lady	1
Diana	1
Sweepstakes,	1
you	1
know,	1
is	1
a	1
famous	1
rider,	1
and	1
archer,	1
and	1
ALL	1
THAT--"	1
"Very	1
likely,"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Gresham,	1
soberly;	1
"but	1
what	1
then?"	1
"Dear	1
uncle!"	1
cried	1
Hal,	1
"but	1
you	1
shall	1
hear.	1
There's	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
race	1
upon	1
the	1
Downs	1
on	1
the	1
first	1
of	1
September,	1
and	1
after	1
the	1
race,	1
there's	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
archery	1
meeting	1
for	1
the	1
ladies,	1
and	1
Lady	1
Diana	1
Sweepstakes	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
one	1
of	1
THEM.	1
And	1
after	1
the	1
ladies	1
have	1
done	1
shooting--now,	1
Ben,	1
comes	1
the	1
best	1
part	1
of	1
it!	1
we	1
boys	1
are	1
to	1
have	1
our	1
turn,	1
and	1
Lady	1
Di	1
is	1
to	1
give	1
a	1
prize	1
to	1
the	1
best	1
marksman	1
amongst	1
us,	1
of	1
a	1
very	1
handsome	1
bow	1
and	1
arrow!	1
Do	1
you	1
know,	1
I've	1
been	1
practising	1
already,	1
and	1
I'll	1
show	1
you,	1
to-morrow,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
it	1
comes	1
home,	1
the	1
FAMOUS	1
bow	1
and	1
arrow	1
that	1
Lady	1
Diana	1
has	1
given	1
me;	1
but,	1
perhaps,"	1
added	1
he,	1
with	1
a	1
scornful	1
laugh,	1
"you	1
like	1
a	1
cat's	1
cradle	1
better	1
than	1
a	1
bow	1
and	1
arrow."	1
Ben	1
made	1
no	1
reply	1
to	1
this	1
taunt	1
at	1
the	1
moment;	1
but	1
the	1
next	1
day,	1
when	1
Hal's	1
new	1
bow	1
and	1
arrow	1
came	1
home,	1
he	1
convinced	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
knew	1
how	1
to	1
use	1
it	1
very	1
well.	1
"Ben,"	1
said	1
his	1
uncle,	1
"you	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
good	1
marksman,	1
though	1
you	1
have	1
not	1
boasted	1
of	1
yourself.	1
I'll	1
give	1
you	1
a	1
bow	1
and	1
arrow,	1
and,	1
perhaps,	1
if	1
you	1
practise,	1
you	1
may	1
make	1
yourself	1
an	1
archer	1
before	1
the	1
first	1
of	1
September;	1
and,	1
in	1
the	1
meantime,	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
wish	1
the	1
fortnight	1
to	1
be	1
over,	1
for	1
you	1
will	1
have	1
something	1
to	1
do."	1
"Oh,	1
sir,"	1
interrupted	1
Hal,	1
"but	1
if	1
you	1
mean	1
that	1
Ben	1
should	1
put	1
in	1
for	1
the	1
prize,	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
a	1
uniform."	1
"Why	1
MUST	1
he?"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Gresham.	1
"Why,	1
sir,	1
because	1
everybody	1
has--I	1
mean	1
everybody	1
that's	1
anybody;	1
and	1
Lady	1
Diana	1
was	1
talking	1
about	1
the	1
uniform	1
all	1
dinner	1
time,	1
and	1
it's	1
settled,	1
all	1
about	1
it,	1
except	1
the	1
buttons:	1
the	1
young	1
Sweepstakes	1
are	1
to	1
get	1
theirs	1
made	1
first	1
for	1
patterns--they	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
white,	1
faced	1
with	1
green,	1
and	1
they'll	1
look	1
very	1
handsome,	1
I'm	1
sure;	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
write	1
to	1
mamma	1
to-night,	1
as	1
Lady	1
Diana	1
bid	1
me,	1
about	1
mine;	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
tell	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
sure	1
to	1
answer	1
my	1
letter,	1
without	1
fail,	1
by	1
return	1
of	1
post;	1
and	1
then,	1
if	1
mamma	1
makes	1
no	1
objection,	1
which	1
I	1
know	1
she	1
won't,	1
because	1
she	1
never	1
thinks	1
much	1
about	1
expense,	1
and	1
ALL	1
THAT--then	1
I	1
shall	1
bespeak	1
my	1
uniform,	1
and	1
get	1
it	1
made	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
tailor	1
that	1
makes	1
for	1
Lady	1
Diana	1
and	1
the	1
young	1
Sweepstakes."	1
"Mercy	1
upon	1
us!"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Gresham,	1
who	1
was	1
almost	1
stunned	1
by	1
the	1
rapid	1
vociferation	1
with	1
which	1
this	1
long	1
speech	1
about	1
a	1
uniform	1
was	1
pronounced.	1
"I	1
don't	1
pretend	1
to	1
understand	1
these	1
things,"	1
added	1
he,	1
with	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
simplicity;	1
"but	1
we	1
will	1
inquire,	1
Ben,	1
into	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
the	1
case;	1
and	1
if	1
it	1
is	1
necessary--or,	1
if	1
you	1
think	1
it	1
necessary,	1
that	1
you	1
shall	1
have	1
a	1
uniform--why,	1
I'll	1
give	1
you	1
one."	1
"YOU,	1
uncle?	1
Will	1
you,	1
INDEED?"	1
exclaimed	1
Hal,	1
with	1
amazement	1
painted	1
in	1
his	1
countenance.	1
"Well,	1
that's	1
the	1
last	1
thing	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
expected!	1
You	1
are	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
the	1
sort	1
of	1
person	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
thought	1
would	1
care	1
about	1
a	1
uniform;	1
and	1
now	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
supposed	1
you'd	1
have	1
thought	1
it	1
extravagant	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
coat	1
on	1
purpose	1
only	1
for	1
one	1
day;	1
and	1
I'm	1
sure	1
Lady	1
Diana	1
Sweepstakes	1
thought	1
as	1
I	1
do;	1
for	1
when	1
I	1
told	1
her	1
of	1
that	1
motto	1
over	1
your	1
kitchen	1
chimney,	1
'WASTE	1
NOT,	1
WANT	1
NOT,'	1
she	1
laughed,	1
and	1
said	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
better	1
not	1
talk	1
to	1
you	1
about	1
uniforms,	1
and	1
that	1
my	1
mother	1
was	1
the	1
proper	1
person	1
to	1
write	1
to	1
about	1
my	1
uniform:	1
but	1
I'll	1
tell	1
Lady	1
Diana,	1
uncle,	1
how	1
good	1
you	1
are,	1
and	1
how	1
much	1
she	1
was	1
mistaken."	1
"Take	1
care	1
how	1
you	1
do	1
that,"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Gresham:	1
"for	1
perhaps	1
the	1
lady	1
was	1
not	1
mistaken."	1
"Nay,	1
did	1
not	1
you	1
say,	1
just	1
now,	1
you	1
would	1
give	1
poor	1
Ben	1
a	1
uniform?"	1
"I	1
said	1
I	1
would,	1
if	1
he	1
thought	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
have	1
one."	1
"Oh,	1
I'll	1
answer	1
for	1
it,	1
he'll	1
think	1
it	1
necessary,	1
"	1
said	1
Hal,	1
laughing,	1
"because	1
it	1
is	1
necessary."	1
"Allow	1
him,	1
at	1
least,	1
to	1
judge	1
for	1
himself,"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Gresham.	1
"My	1
dear	1
uncle,	1
but	1
I	1
assure	1
you,"	1
said	1
Hal,	1
earnestly,	1
"there's	1
no	1
judging	1
about	1
the	1
matter,	1
because	1
really,	1
upon	1
my	1
word,	1
Lady	1
Diana	1
said	1
distinctly,	1
that	1
her	1
sons	1
were	1
to	1
have	1
uniforms,	1
white	1
faced	1
with	1
green,	1
and	1
a	1
green	1
and	1
white	1
cockade	1
in	1
their	1
hats."	1
"May	1
be	1
so,"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Gresham,	1
still	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
look	1
of	1
calm	1
simplicity;	1
"put	1
on	1
your	1
hats,	1
boys,	1
and	1
come	1
with	1
me.	1
I	1
know	1
a	1
gentleman	1
whose	1
sons	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
this	1
archery	1
meeting,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
inquire	1
into	1
all	1
the	1
particulars	1
from	1
him.	1
Then,	1
after	1
we	1
have	1
seen	1
him	1
(it	1
is	1
not	1
eleven	1
o'clock	1
yet)	1
we	1
shall	1
have	1
time	1
enough	1
to	1
walk	1
on	1
to	1
Bristol,	1
and	1
choose	1
the	1
cloth	1
for	1
Ben's	1
uniform,	1
if	1
it	1
is	1
necessary."	1
"I	1
cannot	1
tell	1
what	1
to	1
make	1
of	1
all	1
he	1
says,"	1
whispered	1
Hal,	1
as	1
he	1
reached	1
down	1
his	1
hat;	1
"do	1
you	1
think,	1
Ben,	1
he	1
means	1
to	1
give	1
you	1
this	1
uniform,	1
or	1
not?"	1
"I	1
think,"	1
said	1
Ben,	1
"that	1
he	1
means	1
to	1
give	1
me	1
one,	1
if	1
it	1
is	1
necessary;	1
or,	1
as	1
he	1
said,	1
if	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
is	1
necessary."	1
"And	1
that	1
to	1
be	1
sure	1
you	1
will;	1
won't	1
you?	1
or	1
else	1
you'll	1
be	1
a	1
great	1
fool,	1
I	1
know,	1
after	1
all	1
I've	1
told	1
you.	1
How	1
can	1
anyone	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
know	1
so	1
much	1
about	1
the	1
matter	1
as	1
I,	1
who	1
have	1
dined	1
with	1
Lady	1
Diana	1
Sweepstakes	1
but	1
yesterday,	1
and	1
heard	1
all	1
about	1
it	1
from	1
beginning	1
to	1
end?	1
And	1
as	1
for	1
this	1
gentleman	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
going	1
to,	1
I'm	1
sure,	1
if	1
he	1
knows	1
anything	1
about	1
the	1
matter,	1
he'll	1
say	1
exactly	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
I	1
do."	1
"We	1
shall	1
hear,"	1
said	1
Ben,	1
with	1
a	1
degree	1
of	1
composure	1
which	1
Hal	1
could	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
comprehend	1
when	1
a	1
uniform	1
was	1
in	1
question.	1
The	1
gentleman	1
upon	1
whom	1
Mr.	1
Gresham	1
called	1
had	1
three	1
sons,	1
who	1
were	1
all	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
this	1
archery	1
meeting;	1
and	1
they	1
unanimously	1
assured	1
him,	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
Hal	1
and	1
Ben,	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
never	1
thought	1
of	1
buying	1
uniforms	1
for	1
this	1
grand	1
occasion,	1
and	1
that,	1
amongst	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
their	1
acquaintance,	1
they	1
knew	1
of	1
but	1
three	1
boys	1
whose	1
friends	1
intended	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
such	1
an	1
UNNECESSARY	1
expense.	1
Hal	1
stood	1
amazed.	1
"Such	1
are	1
the	1
varieties	1
of	1
opinion	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
grand	1
affairs	1
of	1
life,"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Gresham,	1
looking	1
at	1
his	1
nephews.	1
"What	1
amongst	1
one	1
set	1
of	1
people	1
you	1
hear	1
asserted	1
to	1
be	1
absolutely	1
necessary,	1
you	1
will	1
hear	1
from	1
another	1
set	1
of	1
people	1
is	1
quite	1
unnecessary.	1
All	1
that	1
can	1
be	1
done,	1
my	1
dear	1
boys,	1
in	1
these	1
difficult	1
cases,	1
is	1
to	1
judge	1
for	1
yourselves,	1
which	1
opinions,	1
and	1
which	1
people,	1
are	1
the	1
most	1
reasonable."	1
Hal,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
more	1
accustomed	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
fashionable,	1
than	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
reasonable,	1
without	1
at	1
all	1
considering	1
the	1
good	1
sense	1
of	1
what	1
his	1
uncle	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
replied,	1
with	1
childish	1
petulance,	1
"Indeed,	1
sir,	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
what	1
other	1
people	1
think;	1
but	1
I	1
only	1
know	1
what	1
Lady	1
Diana	1
Sweepstakes	1
said."	1
The	1
name	1
of	1
Lady	1
Diana	1
Sweepstakes,	1
Hal	1
thought,	1
must	1
impress	1
all	1
present	1
with	1
respect;	1
he	1
was	1
highly	1
astonished,	1
when,	1
as	1
he	1
looked	1
round,	1
he	1
saw	1
a	1
smile	1
of	1
contempt	1
upon	1
everyone's	1
countenance:	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
yet	1
further	1
bewildered,	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
her	1
spoken	1
of	1
as	1
a	1
very	1
silly,	1
extravagant,	1
ridiculous	1
woman,	1
whose	1
opinion	1
no	1
prudent	1
person	1
would	1
ask	1
upon	1
any	1
subject,	1
and	1
whose	1
example	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
shunned,	1
instead	1
of	1
being	1
imitated.	1
"Ay,	1
my	1
dear	1
Hal,"	1
said	1
his	1
uncle,	1
smiling	1
at	1
his	1
look	1
of	1
amazement,	1
"these	1
are	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
young	1
people	1
must	1
learn	1
from	1
experience.	1
All	1
the	1
world	1
do	1
not	1
agree	1
in	1
opinion	1
about	1
characters:	1
you	1
will	1
hear	1
the	1
same	1
person	1
admired	1
in	1
one	1
company,	1
and	1
blamed	1
in	1
another;	1
so	1
that	1
we	1
must	1
still	1
come	1
round	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
point,	1
'Judge	1
for	1
yourself.'"	1
Hal's	1
thoughts	1
were,	1
however,	1
at	1
present	1
too	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
uniform	1
to	1
allow	1
his	1
judgment	1
to	1
act	1
with	1
perfect	1
impartiality.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
their	1
visit	1
was	1
over,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
they	1
walked	1
down	1
the	1
hill	1
from	1
Prince's	1
Building's	1
towards	1
Bristol,	1
he	1
continued	1
to	1
repeat	1
nearly	1
the	1
same	1
arguments,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
formerly	1
used,	1
respecting	1
necessity,	1
the	1
uniform,	1
and	1
Lady	1
Diana	1
Sweepstakes.	1
To	1
all	1
this	1
Mr.	1
Gresham	1
made	1
no	1
reply,	1
and	1
longer	1
had	1
the	1
young	1
gentleman	1
expatiated	1
upon	1
the	1
subject,	1
which	1
had	1
so	1
strongly	1
seized	1
upon	1
his	1
imagination,	1
had	1
not	1
his	1
senses	1
been	1
forcibly	1
assailed	1
at	1
this	1
instant	1
by	1
the	1
delicious	1
odours	1
and	1
tempting	1
sight	1
of	1
certain	1
cakes	1
and	1
jellies	1
in	1
a	1
pastrycook's	1
shop.	1
"Oh,	1
uncle,"	1
said	1
he,	1
as	1
his	1
uncle	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
turn	1
the	1
corner	1
to	1
pursue	1
the	1
road	1
to	1
Bristol,	1
"look	1
at	1
those	1
jellies!"	1
pointing	1
to	1
a	1
confectioner's	1
shop.	1
"I	1
must	1
buy	1
some	1
of	1
those	1
good	1
things,	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
got	1
some	1
halfpence	1
in	1
my	1
pocket."	1
"Your	1
having	1
halfpence	1
in	1
your	1
pocket	1
is	1
an	1
excellent	1
reason	1
for	1
eating,"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Gresham,	1
smiling.	1
"But	1
I	1
really	1
am	1
hungry,"	1
said	1
Hal;	1
"you	1
know,	1
uncle,	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
good	1
while	1
since	1
breakfast."	1
His	1
uncle,	1
who	1
was	1
desirous	1
to	1
see	1
his	1
nephews	1
act	1
without	1
restraint,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
judge	1
their	1
characters,	1
bid	1
them	1
do	1
as	1
they	1
pleased.	1
"Come,	1
then,	1
Ben,	1
if	1
you've	1
any	1
halfpence	1
in	1
your	1
pocket."	1
"I'm	1
not	1
hungry,"	1
said	1
Ben.	1
"I	1
suppose	1
THAT	1
means	1
that	1
you've	1
no	1
halfpence,"	1
said	1
Hal,	1
laughing,	1
with	1
the	1
look	1
of	1
superiority	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
taught	1
to	1
think	1
the	1
RICH	1
might	1
assume	1
towards	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
convicted	1
either	1
of	1
poverty	1
or	1
economy.	1
"Waste	1
not,	1
want	1
not,"	1
said	1
Ben	1
to	1
himself.	1
Contrary	1
to	1
his	1
cousin's	1
surmise,	1
he	1
happened	1
to	1
have	1
two	1
pennyworth	1
of	1
halfpence	1
actually	1
in	1
his	1
pocket.	1
At	1
the	1
very	1
moment	1
Hal	1
stepped	1
into	1
the	1
pastrycook's	1
shop,	1
a	1
poor,	1
industrious	1
man,	1
with	1
a	1
wooden	1
leg,	1
who	1
usually	1
sweeps	1
the	1
dirty	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
walk	1
which	1
turns	1
at	1
this	1
spot	1
to	1
the	1
Wells,	1
held	1
his	1
hat	1
to	1
Ben,	1
who,	1
after	1
glancing	1
his	1
eye	1
at	1
the	1
petitioner's	1
well	1
worn	1
broom,	1
instantly	1
produced	1
his	1
twopence.	1
"I	1
wish	1
I	1
had	1
more	1
halfpence	1
for	1
you,	1
my	1
good	1
man,"	1
said	1
he;	1
"but	1
I've	1
only	1
twopence."	1
Hal	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Millar's,	1
the	1
confectioner's	1
shop,	1
with	1
a	1
hatful	1
of	1
cakes	1
in	1
his	1
hand.	1
Mr.	1
Millar's	1
dog	1
was	1
sitting	1
on	1
the	1
flags	1
before	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
he	1
looked	1
up	1
with	1
a	1
wistful,	1
begging	1
eye	1
at	1
Hal,	1
who	1
was	1
eating	1
a	1
queen	1
cake.	1
Hal,	1
who	1
was	1
wasteful	1
even	1
in	1
his	1
good-nature,	1
threw	1
a	1
whole	1
queen	1
cake	1
to	1
the	1
dog,	1
who	1
swallowed	1
it	1
for	1
a	1
single	1
mouthful.	1
"There	1
goes	1
twopence	1
in	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
a	1
queen	1
cake,"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Gresham.	1
Hal	1
next	1
offered	1
some	1
of	1
his	1
cakes	1
to	1
his	1
uncle	1
and	1
cousin;	1
but	1
they	1
thanked	1
him,	1
and	1
refused	1
to	1
eat	1
any,	1
because,	1
they	1
said,	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
hungry;	1
so	1
he	1
ate	1
and	1
ate	1
as	1
he	1
walked	1
along,	1
till	1
at	1
last	1
he	1
stopped,	1
and	1
said,	1
"This	1
bun	1
tastes	1
so	1
bad	1
after	1
the	1
queen	1
cakes,	1
I	1
can't	1
bear	1
it!"	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
fling	1
it	1
from	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
river.	1
"Oh,	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
pity	1
to	1
waste	1
that	1
good	1
bun;	1
we	1
may	1
be	1
glad	1
of	1
it	1
yet,"	1
said	1
Ben;	1
"give	1
it	1
me	1
rather	1
than	1
throw	1
it	1
away."	1
"Why,	1
I	1
thought	1
you	1
said	1
you	1
were	1
not	1
hungry,"	1
said	1
Hal.	1
"True,	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
hungry	1
now;	1
but	1
that	1
is	1
no	1
reason	1
why	1
I	1
should	1
never	1
be	1
hungry	1
again."	1
"Well,	1
there	1
is	1
the	1
cake	1
for	1
you.	1
Take	1
it;	1
for	1
it	1
has	1
made	1
me	1
sick,	1
and	1
I	1
don't	1
care	1
what	1
becomes	1
of	1
it."	1
Ben	1
folded	1
the	1
refuse	1
bit	1
of	1
his	1
cousin's	1
bun	1
in	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
paper,	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
into	1
his	1
pocket.	1
"I'm	1
beginning	1
to	1
be	1
exceeding	1
tired	1
or	1
sick	1
or	1
something,"	1
said	1
Hal;	1
"and	1
as	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
stand	1
of	1
coaches	1
somewhere	1
hereabouts,	1
had	1
not	1
we	1
better	1
take	1
a	1
coach,	1
instead	1
of	1
walking	1
all	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
Bristol?"	1
"For	1
a	1
stout	1
archer,"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Gresham,	1
"you	1
are	1
more	1
easily	1
tired	1
than	1
one	1
might	1
have	1
expected.	1
However,	1
with	1
all	1
my	1
heart,	1
let	1
us	1
take	1
a	1
coach,	1
for	1
Ben	1
asked	1
me	1
to	1
show	1
him	1
the	1
cathedral	1
yesterday;	1
and	1
I	1
believe	1
I	1
should	1
find	1
it	1
rather	1
too	1
much	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
walk	1
so	1
far,	1
though	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
sick	1
with	1
eating	1
good	1
things."	1
"THE	1
CATHEDRAL!"	1
said	1
Hal,	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
seated	1
in	1
the	1
coach	1
about	1
a	1
quarter	1
of	1
an	1
hour,	1
and	1
had	1
somewhat	1
recovered	1
from	1
his	1
sickness--"the	1
cathedral!	1
Why,	1
are	1
we	1
only	1
going	1
to	1
Bristol	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
cathedral?	1
I	1
thought	1
we	1
came	1
out	1
to	1
see	1
about	1
a	1
uniform."	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
dulness	1
and	1
melancholy	1
kind	1
of	1
stupidity	1
in	1
Hal's	1
countenance	1
as	1
he	1
pronounced	1
these	1
words,	1
like	1
one	1
wakening	1
from	1
a	1
dream,	1
which	1
made	1
both	1
his	1
uncle	1
and	1
his	1
cousin	1
burst	1
out	1
a-laughing.	1
"Why,"	1
said	1
Hal,	1
who	1
was	1
now	1
piqued,	1
"I'm	1
sure	1
you	1
did	1
say,	1
uncle,	1
you	1
would	1
go	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Hall's	1
to	1
choose	1
the	1
cloth	1
for	1
the	1
uniform."	1
"Very	1
true,	1
and	1
so	1
I	1
will,"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Gresham;	1
"but	1
we	1
need	1
not	1
make	1
a	1
whole	1
morning's	1
work,	1
need	1
we,	1
of	1
looking	1
at	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
cloth?	1
Cannot	1
we	1
see	1
a	1
uniform	1
and	1
a	1
cathedral	1
both	1
in	1
one	1
morning?"	1
They	1
went	1
first	1
to	1
the	1
cathedral.	1
Hal's	1
head	1
was	1
too	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
uniform	1
to	1
take	1
any	1
notice	1
of	1
the	1
painted	1
window,	1
which	1
immediately	1
caught	1
Ben's	1
embarrassed	1
attention.	1
He	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
large	1
stained	1
figures	1
on	1
the	1
Gothic	1
window,	1
and	1
he	1
observed	1
their	1
coloured	1
shadows	1
on	1
the	1
floor	1
and	1
walls.	1
Mr.	1
Gresham,	1
who	1
perceived	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
eager	1
on	1
all	1
subjects	1
to	1
gain	1
information,	1
took	1
this	1
opportunity	1
of	1
telling	1
him	1
several	1
things	1
about	1
the	1
lost	1
art	1
of	1
painting	1
on	1
glass,	1
Gothic	1
arches,	1
etc.,	1
which	1
Hal	1
thought	1
extremely	1
tiresome.	1
"Come!	1
come!	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
late	1
indeed,"	1
said	1
Hal;	1
"surely	1
you've	1
looked	1
long	1
enough,	1
Ben,	1
at	1
this	1
blue	1
and	1
red	1
window."	1
"I'm	1
only	1
thinking	1
about	1
these	1
coloured	1
shadows,"	1
said	1
Ben.	1
"I	1
can	1
show	1
you	1
when	1
we	1
go	1
home,	1
Ben,"	1
said	1
his	1
uncle,	1
"an	1
entertaining	1
paper	1
upon	1
such	1
shadows."*	1
*Vide	1
"Priestley's	1
History	1
of	1
Vision,"	1
chapter	1
on	1
coloured	1
shadows.	1
"Hark!"	1
cried	1
Ben,	1
"did	1
you	1
hear	1
that	1
noise?"	1
They	1
all	1
listened;	1
and	1
they	1
heard	1
a	1
bird	1
singing	1
in	1
the	1
cathedral.	1
"It's	1
our	1
old	1
robin,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
the	1
lad	1
who	1
had	1
opened	1
the	1
cathedral	1
door	1
for	1
them.	1
"Yes,"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Gresham,	1
"there	1
he	1
is,	1
boys--look--perched	1
upon	1
the	1
organ;	1
he	1
often	1
sits	1
there,	1
and	1
sings,	1
whilst	1
the	1
organ	1
is	1
playing."	1
"And,"	1
continued	1
the	1
lad	1
who	1
showed	1
the	1
cathedral,	1
"he	1
has	1
lived	1
here	1
these	1
many,	1
many	1
winters.	1
They	1
say	1
he	1
is	1
fifteen	1
years	1
old;	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
so	1
tame,	1
poor	1
fellow!	1
that	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
bread	1
he'd	1
come	1
down	1
and	1
feed	1
in	1
my	1
hand."	1
"I've	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
bun	1
here,"	1
cried	1
Ben,	1
joyfully,	1
producing	1
the	1
remains	1
of	1
the	1
bun	1
which	1
Hal	1
but	1
an	1
hour	1
before	1
would	1
have	1
thrown	1
away.	1
"Pray,	1
let	1
us	1
see	1
the	1
poor	1
robin	1
eat	1
out	1
of	1
your	1
hand."	1
The	1
lad	1
crumbled	1
the	1
bun,	1
and	1
called	1
to	1
the	1
robin,	1
who	1
fluttered	1
and	1
chirped,	1
and	1
seemed	1
rejoiced	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
bread;	1
but	1
yet	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
come	1
down	1
from	1
his	1
pinnacle	1
on	1
the	1
organ.	1
"He	1
is	1
afraid	1
of	1
US,"	1
said	1
Ben;	1
"he	1
is	1
not	1
used	1
to	1
eat	1
before	1
strangers,	1
I	1
suppose."	1
"Ah,	1
no,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
the	1
young	1
man,	1
with	1
a	1
deep	1
sigh,	1
"that	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
thing.	1
He	1
is	1
used	1
enough	1
to	1
eat	1
afore	1
company.	1
Time	1
was	1
he'd	1
have	1
come	1
down	1
for	1
me	1
before	1
ever	1
so	1
many	1
fine	1
folks,	1
and	1
have	1
eat	1
his	1
crumbs	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
hand,	1
at	1
my	1
first	1
call;	1
but,	1
poor	1
fellow!	1
it's	1
not	1
his	1
fault	1
now.	1
He	1
does	1
not	1
know	1
me	1
now,	1
sir,	1
since	1
my	1
accident,	1
because	1
of	1
this	1
great	1
black	1
patch."	1
The	1
young	1
man	1
put	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
his	1
right	1
eye,	1
which	1
was	1
covered	1
with	1
a	1
huge	1
black	1
patch.	1
Ben	1
asked	1
what	1
ACCIDENT	1
he	1
meant;	1
and	1
the	1
lad	1
told	1
him	1
that,	1
but	1
a	1
few	1
weeks	1
ago,	1
he	1
had	1
lost	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
his	1
eye	1
by	1
the	1
stroke	1
of	1
a	1
stone,	1
which	1
reached	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
passing	1
under	1
the	1
rocks	1
at	1
Clifton	1
unluckily	1
when	1
the	1
workmen	1
were	1
blasting.	1
"I	1
don't	1
mind	1
so	1
much	1
for	1
myself,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
the	1
lad;	1
"but	1
I	1
can't	1
work	1
so	1
well	1
now,	1
as	1
I	1
used	1
to	1
do	1
before	1
my	1
accident,	1
for	1
my	1
old	1
mother,	1
who	1
has	1
had	1
a	1
STROKE	1
of	1
the	1
palsy;	1
and	1
I've	1
a	1
many	1
little	1
brothers	1
and	1
sisters	1
not	1
well	1
able	1
yet	1
to	1
get	1
their	1
own	1
livelihood,	1
though	1
they	1
be	1
as	1
willing	1
as	1
willing	1
can	1
be."	1
"Where	1
does	1
your	1
mother	1
live?"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Gresham.	1
"Hard	1
by,	1
sir,	1
just	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
church	1
here:	1
it	1
was	1
HER	1
that	1
always	1
had	1
the	1
showing	1
of	1
it	1
to	1
strangers,	1
till	1
she	1
lost	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
her	1
poor	1
limbs."	1
"Shall	1
we,	1
may	1
we,	1
uncle,	1
go	1
that	1
way?	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
house;	1
is	1
not	1
it?"	1
said	1
Ben,	1
when	1
they	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
cathedral.	1
They	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
house;	1
it	1
was	1
rather	1
a	1
hovel	1
than	1
a	1
house;	1
but,	1
poor	1
as	1
it	1
was,	1
it	1
was	1
as	1
neat	1
as	1
misery	1
could	1
make	1
it.	1
The	1
old	1
woman	1
was	1
sitting	1
up	1
in	1
her	1
wretched	1
bed,	1
winding	1
worsted;	1
four	1
meagre,	1
ill-	1
clothed,	1
pale	1
children	1
were	1
all	1
busy,	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
sticking	1
pins	1
in	1
paper	1
for	1
the	1
pin-maker,	1
and	1
others	1
sorting	1
rags	1
for	1
the	1
paper-maker.	1
"What	1
a	1
horrid	1
place	1
it	1
is!"	1
said	1
Hal,	1
sighing;	1
"I	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
there	1
were	1
such	1
shocking	1
places	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
I've	1
often	1
seen	1
terrible-	1
looking,	1
tumble-down	1
places,	1
as	1
we	1
drove	1
through	1
the	1
town	1
in	1
mamma's	1
carriage;	1
but	1
then	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
who	1
lived	1
in	1
them;	1
and	1
I	1
never	1
saw	1
the	1
inside	1
of	1
any	1
of	1
them.	1
It	1
is	1
very	1
dreadful,	1
indeed,	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
people	1
are	1
forced	1
to	1
live	1
in	1
this	1
way.	1
I	1
wish	1
mamma	1
would	1
send	1
me	1
some	1
more	1
pocket-money,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
do	1
something	1
for	1
them.	1
I	1
had	1
half	1
a	1
crown;	1
but,"	1
continued	1
he,	1
feeling	1
in	1
his	1
pockets,	1
"I'm	1
afraid	1
I	1
spent	1
the	1
last	1
shilling	1
of	1
it	1
this	1
morning	1
upon	1
those	1
cakes	1
that	1
made	1
me	1
sick.	1
I	1
wish	1
I	1
had	1
my	1
shilling	1
now,	1
I'd	1
give	1
it	1
to	1
these	1
poor	1
people."	1
Ben,	1
though	1
he	1
was	1
all	1
this	1
time	1
silent,	1
was	1
as	1
sorry	1
as	1
his	1
talkative	1
cousin	1
for	1
all	1
these	1
poor	1
people.	1
But	1
there	1
was	1
some	1
difference	1
between	1
the	1
sorrow	1
of	1
these	1
two	1
boys.	1
Hal,	1
after	1
he	1
was	1
again	1
seated	1
in	1
the	1
hackney-coach,	1
and	1
had	1
rattled	1
through	1
the	1
busy	1
streets	1
of	1
Bristol,	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
quite	1
forgot	1
the	1
spectacle	1
of	1
misery	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
seen;	1
and	1
the	1
gay	1
shops	1
in	1
Wine	1
Street	1
and	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
his	1
green	1
and	1
white	1
uniform	1
wholly	1
occupied	1
his	1
imagination.	1
"Now	1
for	1
our	1
uniforms!"	1
cried	1
he,	1
as	1
he	1
jumped	1
eagerly	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
coach,	1
when	1
his	1
uncle	1
stopped	1
at	1
the	1
woollen-draper's	1
door.	1
"Uncle,"	1
said	1
Ben,	1
stopping	1
Mr.	1
Gresham	1
before	1
he	1
got	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
carriage,	1
"I	1
don't	1
think	1
a	1
uniform	1
is	1
at	1
all	1
necessary	1
for	1
me.	1
I'm	1
very	1
much	1
obliged	1
to	1
you;	1
but	1
I	1
would	1
rather	1
not	1
have	1
one.	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
coat,	1
and	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
waste."	1
"Well,	1
let	1
me	1
get	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
carriage,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
see	1
about	1
it,"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Gresham;	1
"perhaps	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
beautiful	1
green	1
and	1
white	1
cloth,	1
and	1
the	1
epaulettes	1
(have	1
you	1
ever	1
considered	1
the	1
epaulettes?)	1
may	1
tempt	1
you	1
to	1
change	1
your	1
mind."	1
"Oh,	1
no,"	1
said	1
Ben,	1
laughing;	1
"I	1
shall	1
not	1
change	1
my	1
mind,"	1
The	1
green	1
cloth,	1
and	1
the	1
white	1
cloth,	1
and	1
the	1
epaulettes	1
were	1
produced,	1
to	1
Hal's	1
infinite	1
satisfaction.	1
His	1
uncle	1
took	1
up	1
a	1
pen,	1
and	1
calculated	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
minutes;	1
then,	1
showing	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
the	1
letter,	1
upon	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
writing,	1
to	1
his	1
nephews,	1
"Cast	1
up	1
these	1
sums,	1
boys,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"and	1
tell	1
me	1
whether	1
I	1
am	1
right."	1
"Ben,	1
do	1
you	1
do	1
it,"	1
said	1
Hal,	1
a	1
little	1
embarrassed;	1
"I	1
am	1
not	1
quick	1
at	1
figures."	1
Ben	1
WAS,	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
over	1
his	1
uncle's	1
calculation	1
very	1
expeditiously.	1
"It	1
is	1
right,	1
is	1
it?"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Gresham.	1
"Yes,	1
sir,	1
quite	1
right."	1
"Then,	1
by	1
this	1
calculation,	1
I	1
find	1
I	1
could,	1
for	1
less	1
than	1
half	1
the	1
money	1
your	1
uniforms	1
would	1
cost,	1
purchase	1
for	1
each	1
of	1
you	1
boys	1
a	1
warm	1
great-	1
coat,	1
which	1
you	1
will	1
want,	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
notion,	1
this	1
winter	1
upon	1
the	1
Downs."	1
"Oh,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
Hal,	1
with	1
an	1
alarmed	1
look;	1
"but	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
winter	1
YET;	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
cold	1
weather	1
YET.	1
We	1
sha'n't	1
want	1
greatcoats	1
YET."	1
"Don't	1
you	1
remember	1
how	1
cold	1
we	1
were,	1
Hal,	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
yesterday,	1
in	1
that	1
sharp	1
wind,	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
flying	1
our	1
kite	1
upon	1
the	1
Downs?	1
and	1
winter	1
will	1
come,	1
though	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
come	1
yet--I	1
am	1
sure,	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
good	1
warm	1
great-coat	1
very	1
much."	1
Mr.	1
Gresham	1
took	1
six	1
guineas	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
purse	1
and	1
he	1
placed	1
three	1
of	1
them	1
before	1
Hal,	1
and	1
three	1
before	1
Ben.	1
"Young	1
gentlemen,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"I	1
believe	1
your	1
uniforms	1
would	1
come	1
to	1
about	1
three	1
guineas	1
a	1
piece.	1
Now	1
I	1
will	1
lay	1
out	1
this	1
money	1
for	1
you	1
just	1
as	1
you	1
please.	1
Hal,	1
what	1
say	1
you?"	1
"Why,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
Hal,	1
"a	1
great-coat	1
is	1
a	1
good	1
thing,	1
to	1
be	1
sure;	1
and	1
then,	1
after	1
the	1
great-coat,	1
as	1
you	1
said	1
it	1
would	1
only	1
cost	1
half	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
the	1
uniform,	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
some	1
money	1
to	1
spare,	1
would	1
not	1
there?"	1
"Yes,	1
my	1
dear,	1
about	1
five-and-twenty	1
shillings."	1
"Five-and-twenty	1
shillings?--I	1
could	1
buy	1
and	1
do	1
a	1
great	1
many	1
things,	1
to	1
be	1
sure,	1
with	1
five-and-twenty	1
shillings;	1
but	1
then,	1
THE	1
THING	1
IS,	1
I	1
must	1
go	1
without	1
the	1
uniform,	1
if	1
I	1
have	1
the	1
great-coat."	1
"Certainly,"	1
said	1
his	1
uncle.	1
"Ah!"	1
said	1
Hal,	1
sighing,	1
as	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
epaulettes,	1
"uncle,	1
if	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
displeased,	1
if	1
I	1
choose	1
the	1
uniform--"	1
"I	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
displeased	1
at	1
your	1
choosing	1
whatever	1
you	1
like	1
best,"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Gresham.	1
"Well,	1
then,	1
thank	1
you,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
Hal;	1
"I	1
think	1
I	1
had	1
better	1
have	1
the	1
uniform,	1
because,	1
if	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
the	1
uniform,	1
now,	1
directly,	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
of	1
no	1
use	1
to	1
me,	1
as	1
the	1
archery	1
meeting	1
is	1
the	1
week	1
after	1
next,	1
you	1
know;	1
and,	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
great-coat,	1
perhaps	1
between	1
this	1
time	1
and	1
the	1
VERY	1
cold	1
weather,	1
which,	1
perhaps,	1
won't	1
be	1
till	1
Christmas,	1
papa	1
will	1
buy	1
a	1
great-	1
coat	1
for	1
me;	1
and	1
I'll	1
ask	1
mamma	1
to	1
give	1
me	1
some	1
pocket	1
money	1
to	1
give	1
away,	1
and	1
she	1
will,	1
perhaps."	1
To	1
all	1
this	1
conclusive,	1
conditional	1
reasoning,	1
which	1
depended	1
upon	1
the	1
word	1
PERHAPS,	1
three	1
times	1
repeated,	1
Mr.	1
Gresham	1
made	1
no	1
reply;	1
but	1
he	1
immediately	1
bought	1
the	1
uniform	1
for	1
Hal,	1
and	1
desired	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
sent	1
to	1
Lady	1
Diana	1
Sweepstakes'	1
son's	1
tailor,	1
to	1
be	1
made	1
up.	1
The	1
measure	1
of	1
Hal's	1
happiness	1
was	1
now	1
complete.	1
"And	1
how	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
lay	1
out	1
the	1
three	1
guineas	1
for	1
you,	1
Ben?"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Gresham;	1
"speak,	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
wish	1
for	1
first?"	1
"A	1
great-coat,	1
uncle,	1
if	1
you	1
please."	1
Gresham	1
bought	1
the	1
coat;	1
and,	1
after	1
it	1
was	1
paid	1
for,	1
five-and-twenty	1
shillings	1
of	1
Ben's	1
three	1
guineas	1
remained.	1
"What	1
next,	1
my	1
boy?"	1
said	1
his	1
uncle.	1
"Arrows,	1
uncle,	1
if	1
you	1
please;	1
three	1
arrows."	1
"My	1
dear,	1
I	1
promised	1
you	1
a	1
bow	1
and	1
arrows."	1
"No,	1
uncle,	1
you	1
only	1
said	1
a	1
bow."	1
"Well,	1
I	1
meant	1
a	1
bow	1
and	1
arrows.	1
I'm	1
glad	1
you	1
are	1
so	1
exact,	1
however.	1
It	1
is	1
better	1
to	1
claim	1
less	1
than	1
more	1
than	1
what	1
is	1
promised.	1
The	1
three	1
arrows	1
you	1
shall	1
have.	1
But	1
go	1
on;	1
how	1
shall	1
I	1
dispose	1
of	1
these	1
five-and-	1
twenty	1
shillings	1
for	1
you?"	1
"In	1
clothes,	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
so	1
good,	1
uncle,	1
for	1
that	1
poor	1
boy	1
who	1
has	1
the	1
great	1
black	1
patch	1
on	1
his	1
eye."	1
"I	1
always	1
believed,"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Gresham,	1
shaking	1
hands	1
with	1
Ben,	1
"that	1
economy	1
and	1
generosity	1
were	1
the	1
best	1
friends,	1
instead	1
of	1
being	1
enemies,	1
as	1
some	1
silly,	1
extravagant	1
people	1
would	1
have	1
us	1
think	1
them.	1
Choose	1
the	1
poor,	1
blind	1
boy's	1
coat,	1
my	1
dear	1
nephew,	1
and	1
pay	1
for	1
it.	1
There's	1
no	1
occasion	1
for	1
my	1
praising	1
you	1
about	1
the	1
matter.	1
Your	1
best	1
reward	1
is	1
in	1
your	1
own	1
mind,	1
child;	1
and	1
you	1
want	1
no	1
other,	1
or	1
I'm	1
mistaken.	1
Now,	1
jump	1
into	1
the	1
coach,	1
boys,	1
and	1
let's	1
be	1
off.	1
We	1
shall	1
be	1
late,	1
I'm	1
afraid,"	1
continued	1
he,	1
as	1
the	1
coach	1
drove	1
on:	1
"but	1
I	1
must	1
let	1
you	1
stop,	1
Ben,	1
with	1
your	1
goods,	1
at	1
the	1
poor	1
boy's	1
door."	1
When	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
house,	1
Mr.	1
Gresham	1
opened	1
the	1
coach	1
door,	1
and	1
Ben	1
jumped	1
out	1
with	1
his	1
parcel	1
under	1
his	1
arm.	1
"Stay,	1
stay!	1
you	1
must	1
take	1
me	1
with	1
you,"	1
said	1
his	1
pleased	1
uncle;	1
"I	1
like	1
to	1
see	1
people	1
made	1
happy,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
you	1
do."	1
"And	1
so	1
do	1
I,	1
too,"	1
said	1
Hal;	1
"let	1
me	1
come	1
with	1
you.	1
I	1
almost	1
wish	1
my	1
uniform	1
was	1
not	1
gone	1
to	1
the	1
tailor's,	1
so	1
I	1
do."	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
look	1
of	1
delight	1
and	1
gratitude	1
with	1
which	1
the	1
poor	1
boy	1
received	1
the	1
clothes	1
which	1
Ben	1
gave	1
him;	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
mother	1
and	1
children	1
thank	1
him,	1
he	1
sighed,	1
and	1
said,	1
"Well,	1
I	1
hope	1
mamma	1
will	1
give	1
me	1
some	1
more	1
pocket	1
money	1
soon."	1
Upon	1
his	1
return	1
home,	1
however,	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
FAMOUS	1
bow	1
and	1
arrow,	1
which	1
Lady	1
Diana	1
Sweepstakes	1
had	1
sent	1
him,	1
recalled	1
to	1
his	1
imagination	1
all	1
the	1
joys	1
of	1
his	1
green	1
and	1
white	1
uniform;	1
and	1
he	1
no	1
longer	1
wished	1
that	1
it	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
sent	1
to	1
the	1
tailor's.	1
"But	1
I	1
don't	1
understand,	1
Cousin	1
Hal,"	1
said	1
little	1
Patty,	1
"why	1
you	1
call	1
this	1
bow	1
a	1
FAMOUS	1
bow.	1
You	1
say	1
famous	1
very	1
often;	1
and	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
exactly	1
what	1
it	1
means;	1
a	1
famous	1
uniform--famous	1
doings.	1
I	1
remember	1
you	1
said	1
there	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
famous	1
doings,	1
the	1
first	1
of	1
September,	1
upon	1
the	1
Downs.	1
What	1
does	1
famous	1
mean?"	1
"Oh,	1
why,	1
famous	1
means--now,	1
don't	1
you	1
know	1
what	1
famous	1
means?	1
It	1
means-	1
-it	1
is	1
a	1
word	1
that	1
people	1
say--it	1
is	1
the	1
fashion	1
to	1
say	1
it--it	1
means--it	1
means	1
famous."	1
Patty	1
laughed,	1
and	1
said,	1
"This	1
does	1
not	1
explain	1
it	1
to	1
me."	1
"No,"	1
said	1
Hal,	1
"nor	1
can	1
it	1
be	1
explained:	1
if	1
you	1
don't	1
understand	1
it,	1
that's	1
not	1
my	1
fault.	1
Everybody	1
but	1
little	1
children,	1
I	1
suppose,	1
understands	1
it;	1
but	1
there's	1
no	1
explaining	1
THOSE	1
SORT	1
of	1
words,	1
if	1
you	1
don't	1
TAKE	1
THEM	1
at	1
once.	1
There's	1
to	1
be	1
famous	1
doings	1
upon	1
the	1
Downs,	1
the	1
first	1
of	1
September;	1
that	1
is	1
grand,	1
fine.	1
In	1
short,	1
what	1
does	1
it	1
signify	1
talking	1
any	1
longer,	1
Patty,	1
about	1
the	1
matter?	1
Give	1
me	1
my	1
bow,	1
for	1
I	1
must	1
go	1
out	1
upon	1
the	1
Downs	1
and	1
practise."	1
Ben	1
accompanied	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
bow	1
and	1
the	1
three	1
arrows	1
which	1
his	1
uncle	1
had	1
now	1
given	1
to	1
him;	1
and,	1
every	1
day,	1
these	1
two	1
boys	1
went	1
out	1
upon	1
the	1
Downs	1
and	1
practised	1
shooting	1
with	1
indefatigable	1
perseverance.	1
Where	1
equal	1
pains	1
are	1
taken,	1
success	1
is	1
usually	1
found	1
to	1
be	1
pretty	1
nearly	1
equal.	1
Our	1
two	1
archers,	1
by	1
constant	1
practice,	1
became	1
expert	1
marksmen;	1
and	1
before	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
trial,	1
they	1
were	1
so	1
exactly	1
matched	1
in	1
point	1
of	1
dexterity,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
scarcely	1
possible	1
to	1
decide	1
which	1
was	1
superior.	1
The	1
long	1
expected	1
lst	1
of	1
September	1
at	1
length	1
arrived.	1
"What	1
sort	1
of	1
a	1
day	1
is	1
it?"	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
question	1
that	1
was	1
asked	1
by	1
Hal	1
and	1
Ben	1
the	1
moment	1
that	1
they	1
wakened.	1
The	1
sun	1
shone	1
bright,	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
sharp	1
and	1
high	1
wind.	1
"Ha!"	1
said	1
Ben,	1
"I	1
shall	1
be	1
glad	1
of	1
my	1
good	1
great-coat	1
to-day;	1
for	1
I've	1
a	1
notion	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
rather	1
cold	1
upon	1
the	1
Downs,	1
especially	1
when	1
we	1
are	1
standing	1
still,	1
as	1
we	1
must,	1
whilst	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
are	1
shooting."	1
"Oh,	1
never	1
mind!	1
I	1
don't	1
think	1
I	1
shall	1
feel	1
it	1
cold	1
at	1
all,"	1
said	1
Hal,	1
as	1
he	1
dressed	1
himself	1
in	1
his	1
new	1
green	1
and	1
white	1
uniform;	1
and	1
he	1
viewed	1
himself	1
with	1
much	1
complacency.	1
"Good	1
morning	1
to	1
you,	1
uncle;	1
how	1
do	1
you	1
do?"	1
said	1
he,	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
of	1
exultation,	1
when	1
he	1
entered	1
the	1
breakfast-room.	1
How	1
do	1
you	1
do?	1
seemed	1
rather	1
to	1
mean,	1
"How	1
do	1
you	1
like	1
me	1
in	1
my	1
uniform?"	1
And	1
his	1
uncle's	1
cool,	1
"Very	1
well,	1
I	1
thank	1
you,	1
Hal,"	1
disappointed	1
him,	1
as	1
it	1
seemed	1
only	1
to	1
say,	1
"Your	1
uniform	1
makes	1
no	1
difference	1
in	1
my	1
opinion	1
of	1
you."	1
Even	1
little	1
Patty	1
went	1
on	1
eating	1
her	1
breakfast	1
much	1
as	1
usual,	1
and	1
talked	1
of	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
walking	1
with	1
her	1
father	1
to	1
the	1
Downs,	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
little	1
things	1
which	1
interested	1
her;	1
so	1
that	1
Hal's	1
epaulettes	1
were	1
not	1
the	1
principal	1
object	1
in	1
anyone's	1
imagination	1
but	1
his	1
own.	1
"Papa,"	1
said	1
Patty,	1
"as	1
we	1
go	1
up	1
the	1
hill	1
where	1
there	1
is	1
so	1
much	1
red	1
mud,	1
I	1
must	1
take	1
care	1
to	1
pick	1
my	1
way	1
nicely;	1
and	1
I	1
must	1
hold	1
up	1
my	1
frock,	1
as	1
you	1
desired	1
me,	1
and,	1
perhaps,	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
so	1
good,	1
if	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
troublesome,	1
to	1
lift	1
me	1
over	1
the	1
very	1
bad	1
place	1
where	1
are	1
no	1
stepping-	1
stones.	1
My	1
ankle	1
is	1
entirely	1
well,	1
and	1
I'm	1
glad	1
of	1
that,	1
or	1
else	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
walk	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
the	1
Downs.	1
How	1
good	1
you	1
were	1
to	1
me,	1
Ben,	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
pain	1
the	1
day	1
I	1
sprained	1
my	1
ankle!	1
You	1
played	1
at	1
jack	1
straws	1
and	1
at	1
cat's-cradle	1
with	1
me.	1
Oh,	1
that	1
puts	1
me	1
in	1
mind--here	1
are	1
your	1
gloves	1
which	1
I	1
asked	1
you	1
that	1
night	1
to	1
let	1
me	1
mend.	1
I've	1
been	1
a	1
great	1
while	1
about	1
them;	1
but	1
are	1
not	1
they	1
not	1
very	1
neatly	1
mended,	1
papa?	1
Look	1
at	1
the	1
sewing."	1
"I	1
am	1
not	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
judge	1
of	1
sewing,	1
my	1
dear	1
little	1
girl,"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Gresham,	1
examining	1
the	1
work	1
with	1
a	1
close	1
and	1
scrupulous	1
eye;	1
"but,	1
in	1
my	1
opinion,	1
here	1
is	1
one	1
stitch	1
that	1
is	1
rather	1
too	1
long.	1
The	1
white	1
teeth	1
are	1
not	1
quite	1
even."	1
"Oh,	1
papa,	1
I'll	1
take	1
out	1
that	1
long	1
tooth	1
in	1
a	1
minute,"	1
said	1
Patty,	1
laughing;	1
"I	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
that	1
you	1
would	1
observe	1
it	1
so	1
soon."	1
"I	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
you	1
trust	1
to	1
my	1
blindness,"	1
said	1
her	1
father,	1
stroking	1
her	1
head,	1
fondly;	1
"I	1
observe	1
everything.	1
I	1
observe,	1
for	1
instance,	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
a	1
grateful	1
little	1
girl,	1
and	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
glad	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
use	1
to	1
those	1
who	1
have	1
been	1
kind	1
to	1
you;	1
and	1
for	1
this	1
I	1
forgive	1
you	1
the	1
long	1
stitch."	1
"But	1
it's	1
out,	1
it's	1
out,	1
papa,"	1
said	1
Patty;	1
"and	1
the	1
next	1
time	1
your	1
gloves	1
want	1
mending,	1
Ben,	1
I'll	1
mend	1
them	1
better."	1
"They	1
are	1
very	1
nice,	1
I	1
think,"	1
said	1
Ben,	1
drawing	1
them	1
on;	1
"and	1
I	1
am	1
much	1
obliged	1
to	1
you.	1
I	1
was	1
just	1
wishing	1
I	1
had	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
gloves	1
to	1
keep	1
my	1
fingers	1
warm	1
to-day,	1
for	1
I	1
never	1
can	1
shoot	1
well	1
when	1
my	1
hands	1
are	1
benumbed.	1
Look,	1
Hal;	1
you	1
know	1
how	1
ragged	1
these	1
gloves	1
were;	1
you	1
said	1
they	1
were	1
good	1
for	1
nothing	1
but	1
to	1
throw	1
away;	1
now	1
look,	1
there's	1
not	1
a	1
hole	1
in	1
them,"	1
said	1
he,	1
spreading	1
his	1
fingers.	1
"Now,	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
very	1
extraordinary,"	1
said	1
Hal	1
to	1
himself,	1
"that	1
they	1
should	1
go	1
on	1
so	1
long	1
talking	1
about	1
an	1
old	1
pair	1
of	1
gloves,	1
without	1
saying	1
scarcely	1
a	1
word	1
about	1
my	1
new	1
uniform?	1
Well,	1
the	1
young	1
Sweepstakes	1
and	1
Lady	1
Diana	1
will	1
talk	1
enough	1
about	1
it;	1
that's	1
one	1
comfort.	1
Is	1
not	1
it	1
time	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
setting	1
out,	1
sir?"	1
said	1
Hal	1
to	1
his	1
uncle.	1
"The	1
company,	1
you	1
know,	1
are	1
to	1
meet	1
at	1
the	1
Ostrich	1
at	1
twelve,	1
and	1
the	1
race	1
to	1
begin	1
at	1
one,	1
and	1
Lady	1
Diana's	1
horses,	1
I	1
know	1
were	1
ordered	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
at	1
ten."	1
Mr.	1
Stephen,	1
the	1
butler,	1
here	1
interrupted	1
the	1
hurrying	1
young	1
gentleman	1
in	1
his	1
calculations.	1
"There's	1
a	1
poor	1
lad,	1
sir,	1
below,	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
black	1
patch	1
on	1
his	1
right	1
eye,	1
who	1
is	1
come	1
from	1
Bristol,	1
and	1
wants	1
to	1
speak	1
a	1
word	1
with	1
the	1
young	1
gentlemen,	1
if	1
you	1
please.	1
I	1
told	1
him	1
they	1
were	1
just	1
going	1
out	1
with	1
you;	1
but	1
he	1
says	1
he	1
won't	1
detain	1
them	1
more	1
than	1
half	1
a	1
minute."	1
"Show	1
him	1
up,	1
show	1
him	1
up,"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Gresham.	1
"But,	1
I	1
suppose,"	1
said	1
Hal,	1
with	1
a	1
sigh,	1
"that	1
Stephen	1
mistook,	1
when	1
he	1
said	1
the	1
young	1
GENTLEMEN;	1
he	1
only	1
wants	1
to	1
see	1
Ben,	1
I	1
daresay;	1
I'm	1
sure	1
he	1
has	1
no	1
reason	1
to	1
want	1
to	1
see	1
me."	1
"Here	1
he	1
comes--Oh,	1
Ben,	1
he	1
is	1
dressed	1
in	1
the	1
new	1
coat	1
you	1
gave	1
him,"	1
whispered	1
Hal,	1
who	1
was	1
really	1
a	1
good-natured	1
boy,	1
though	1
extravagant.	1
"How	1
much	1
better	1
he	1
looks	1
than	1
he	1
did	1
in	1
the	1
ragged	1
coat!	1
Ah!	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
you	1
first,	1
Ben--and	1
well	1
he	1
may!"	1
The	1
boy	1
bowed,	1
without	1
any	1
cringing	1
servility,	1
but	1
with	1
an	1
open,	1
decent	1
freedom	1
in	1
his	1
manner,	1
which	1
expressed	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
obliged,	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
knew	1
his	1
young	1
benefactor	1
was	1
not	1
thinking	1
of	1
the	1
obligation.	1
He	1
made	1
as	1
little	1
distinction	1
as	1
possible	1
between	1
his	1
bows	1
to	1
the	1
two	1
cousins.	1
"As	1
I	1
was	1
sent	1
with	1
a	1
message,	1
by	1
the	1
clerk	1
of	1
our	1
parish,	1
to	1
Redland	1
chapel	1
out	1
on	1
the	1
Downs,	1
to-day,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Gresham,	1
"knowing	1
your	1
house	1
lay	1
in	1
my	1
way,	1
my	1
mother,	1
sir,	1
bid	1
me	1
call,	1
and	1
make	1
bold	1
to	1
offer	1
the	1
young	1
gentlemen	1
two	1
little	1
worsted	1
balls	1
that	1
she	1
has	1
worked	1
for	1
them,"	1
continued	1
the	1
lad,	1
pulling	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
pocket	1
two	1
worsted	1
balls	1
worked	1
in	1
green	1
and	1
orange-coloured	1
stripes.	1
"They	1
are	1
but	1
poor	1
things,	1
sir,	1
she	1
bid	1
me	1
say,	1
to	1
look	1
at;	1
but,	1
considering	1
she	1
has	1
but	1
one	1
hand	1
to	1
work	1
with,	1
and	1
that	1
her	1
left	1
hand,	1
you'll	1
not	1
despise	1
'em,	1
we	1
hopes."	1
He	1
held	1
the	1
balls	1
to	1
Ben	1
and	1
Hal.	1
"They	1
are	1
both	1
alike,	1
gentlemen,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"If	1
you'll	1
be	1
pleased	1
to	1
take	1
'em	1
they're	1
better	1
than	1
they	1
look,	1
for	1
they	1
bound	1
higher	1
than	1
your	1
head.	1
I	1
cut	1
the	1
cork	1
round	1
for	1
the	1
inside	1
myself,	1
which	1
was	1
all	1
I	1
could	1
do."	1
"They	1
are	1
nice	1
balls,	1
indeed:	1
we	1
are	1
much	1
obliged	1
to	1
you,"	1
said	1
the	1
boys	1
as	1
they	1
received	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
proved	1
them	1
immediately.	1
The	1
balls	1
struck	1
the	1
floor	1
with	1
a	1
delightful	1
sound,	1
and	1
rebounded	1
higher	1
than	1
Mr.	1
Gresham's	1
head.	1
Little	1
Patty	1
clapped	1
her	1
hands	1
joyfully.	1
But	1
now	1
a	1
thundering	1
double	1
rap	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
was	1
heard.	1
"The	1
Master	1
Sweepstakes,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
Stephen,	1
"are	1
come	1
for	1
Master	1
Hal.	1
They	1
say	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
young	1
gentlemen	1
who	1
have	1
archery	1
uniforms	1
are	1
to	1
walk	1
together,	1
in	1
a	1
body,	1
I	1
think	1
they	1
say,	1
sir;	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
to	1
parade	1
along	1
the	1
Well	1
Walk,	1
they	1
desired	1
me	1
to	1
say,	1
sir,	1
with	1
a	1
drum	1
and	1
fife,	1
and	1
so	1
up	1
the	1
hill	1
by	1
Prince's	1
Place,	1
and	1
all	1
to	1
go	1
upon	1
the	1
Downs	1
together,	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
meeting.	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
sure	1
I'm	1
right,	1
sir;	1
for	1
both	1
the	1
young	1
gentlemen	1
spoke	1
at	1
once,	1
and	1
the	1
wind	1
is	1
very	1
high	1
at	1
the	1
street	1
door;	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
well	1
make	1
out	1
all	1
they	1
said;	1
but	1
I	1
believe	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
it."	1
"Yes,	1
yes,"	1
said	1
Hal,	1
eagerly,	1
"it's	1
all	1
right.	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
is	1
just	1
what	1
was	1
settled	1
the	1
day	1
I	1
dined	1
at	1
Lady	1
Diana's;	1
and	1
Lady	1
Diana	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
party	1
of	1
gentlemen	1
are	1
to	1
ride--"	1
"Well,	1
that	1
is	1
nothing	1
to	1
the	1
purpose,"	1
interrupted	1
Mr.	1
Gresham.	1
"Don't	1
keep	1
these	1
Master	1
Sweepstakes	1
waiting.	1
Decide--do	1
you	1
choose	1
to	1
go	1
with	1
them	1
or	1
with	1
us?"	1
"Sir--uncle--sir,	1
you	1
know,	1
since	1
all	1
the	1
UNIFORMS	1
agreed	1
to	1
go	1
together-	1
-"	1
"Off	1
with	1
you,	1
then,	1
Mr.	1
Uniform,	1
if	1
you	1
mean	1
to	1
go,"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Gresham.	1
Hal	1
ran	1
downstairs	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
hurry	1
that	1
he	1
forgot	1
his	1
bow	1
and	1
arrows.	1
Ben	1
discovered	1
this	1
when	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
fetch	1
his	1
own;	1
and	1
the	1
lad	1
from	1
Bristol,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
ordered	1
by	1
Mr.	1
Gresham	1
to	1
eat	1
his	1
breakfast	1
before	1
he	1
proceeded	1
to	1
Redland	1
Chapel,	1
heard	1
Ben	1
talking	1
about	1
his	1
cousin's	1
bow	1
and	1
arrows.	1
"I	1
know,"	1
said	1
Ben,	1
"he	1
will	1
be	1
sorry	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
his	1
bow	1
with	1
him,	1
because	1
here	1
are	1
the	1
green	1
knots	1
tied	1
to	1
it,	1
to	1
match	1
his	1
cockade:	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
that	1
the	1
boys	1
were	1
all	1
to	1
carry	1
their	1
bows,	1
as	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
show."	1
"If	1
you'll	1
give	1
me	1
leave,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
the	1
poor	1
Bristol	1
lad,	1
"I	1
shall	1
have	1
plenty	1
of	1
time;	1
and	1
I'll	1
run	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
Well	1
Walk	1
after	1
the	1
young	1
gentleman,	1
and	1
take	1
him	1
his	1
bow	1
and	1
arrows."	1
"Will	1
you?	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
much	1
obliged	1
to	1
you,"	1
said	1
Ben;	1
and	1
away	1
went	1
the	1
boy	1
with	1
the	1
bow	1
that	1
was	1
ornamented	1
with	1
green	1
ribands.	1
The	1
public	1
walk	1
leading	1
to	1
the	1
Wells	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
company.	1
The	1
windows	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
houses	1
in	1
St.	1
Vincent's	1
Parade	1
were	1
crowded	1
with	1
well	1
dressed	1
ladies,	1
who	1
were	1
looking	1
out	1
in	1
expectation	1
of	1
the	1
archery	1
procession.	1
Parties	1
of	1
gentlemen	1
and	1
ladies,	1
and	1
a	1
motley	1
crowd	1
of	1
spectators,	1
were	1
seen	1
moving	1
backwards	1
and	1
forwards,	1
under	1
the	1
rocks,	1
on	1
the	1
opposite	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
water.	1
A	1
barge,	1
with	1
coloured	1
streamers	1
flying,	1
was	1
waiting	1
to	1
take	1
up	1
a	1
party	1
who	1
were	1
going	1
upon	1
the	1
water.	1
The	1
bargemen	1
rested	1
upon	1
their	1
oars,	1
and	1
gazed	1
with	1
broad	1
faces	1
of	1
curiosity	1
upon	1
the	1
busy	1
scene	1
that	1
appeared	1
upon	1
the	1
public	1
walk.	1
The	1
archers	1
and	1
archeresses	1
were	1
now	1
drawn	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
flags	1
under	1
the	1
semicircular	1
piazza	1
just	1
before	1
Mrs.	1
Yearsley's	1
library.	1
A	1
little	1
band	1
of	1
children,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
mustered	1
by	1
Lady	1
Diana	1
Sweepstakes'	1
SPIRITED	1
EXERTIONS,	1
closed	1
the	1
procession.	1
They	1
were	1
now	1
all	1
in	1
readiness.	1
The	1
drummer	1
only	1
waited	1
for	1
her	1
ladyship's	1
signal;	1
and	1
the	1
archers'	1
corps	1
only	1
waited	1
for	1
her	1
ladyship's	1
word	1
of	1
command	1
to	1
march.	1
"Where	1
are	1
your	1
bow	1
and	1
arrows,	1
my	1
little	1
man?"	1
said	1
her	1
ladyship	1
to	1
Hal,	1
as	1
she	1
reviewed	1
her	1
Lilliputian	1
regiment.	1
"You	1
can't	1
march,	1
man,	1
without	1
your	1
arms?"	1
Hal	1
had	1
despatched	1
a	1
messenger	1
for	1
his	1
forgotten	1
bow,	1
but	1
the	1
messenger	1
returned	1
not.	1
He	1
looked	1
from	1
side	1
to	1
side	1
in	1
great	1
distress--"Oh,	1
there's	1
my	1
bow	1
coming,	1
I	1
declare!"	1
cried	1
he;	1
"look,	1
I	1
see	1
the	1
bow	1
and	1
the	1
ribands.	1
Look	1
now,	1
between	1
the	1
trees,	1
Charles	1
Sweepstakes,	1
on	1
the	1
Hotwell	1
Walk;	1
it	1
is	1
coming!"	1
"But	1
you've	1
kept	1
us	1
all	1
waiting	1
a	1
confounded	1
time,"	1
said	1
his	1
impatient	1
friend.	1
"It	1
is	1
that	1
good-natured	1
poor	1
fellow	1
from	1
Bristol,	1
I	1
protest,	1
that	1
has	1
brought	1
it	1
me;	1
I'm	1
sure	1
I	1
don't	1
deserve	1
it	1
from	1
him,"	1
said	1
Hal,	1
to	1
himself,	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
lad	1
with	1
the	1
black	1
patch	1
on	1
his	1
eye	1
running,	1
quite	1
out	1
of	1
breath,	1
towards	1
him,	1
with	1
his	1
bow	1
and	1
arrows.	1
"Fall	1
back,	1
my	1
good	1
friend--fall	1
back,"	1
said	1
the	1
military	1
lady,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
delivered	1
the	1
bow	1
to	1
Hal;	1
"I	1
mean,	1
stand	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way,	1
for	1
your	1
great	1
patch	1
cuts	1
no	1
figure	1
amongst	1
us.	1
Don't	1
follow	1
so	1
close,	1
now,	1
as	1
if	1
you	1
belonged	1
to	1
us,	1
pray."	1
The	1
poor	1
boy	1
had	1
no	1
ambition	1
to	1
partake	1
the	1
triumph;	1
he	1
FELL	1
BACK	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
understood	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
the	1
lady's	1
words.	1
The	1
drum	1
beat,	1
the	1
fife	1
played,	1
the	1
archers	1
marched,	1
the	1
spectators	1
admired.	1
Hal	1
stepped	1
proudly,	1
and	1
felt	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
universe	1
were	1
upon	1
his	1
epaulettes,	1
or	1
upon	1
the	1
facings	1
of	1
his	1
uniform;	1
whilst	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
he	1
was	1
considered	1
only	1
as	1
part	1
of	1
a	1
show.	1
The	1
walk	1
appeared	1
much	1
shorter	1
than	1
usual,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
extremely	1
sorry	1
that	1
Lady	1
Diana,	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
half-way	1
up	1
the	1
hill	1
leading	1
to	1
Prince's	1
Place,	1
mounted	1
her	1
horse,	1
because	1
the	1
road	1
was	1
dirty,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
and	1
ladies	1
who	1
accompanied	1
her	1
followed	1
her	1
example.	1
"We	1
can	1
leave	1
the	1
children	1
to	1
walk,	1
you	1
know,"	1
said	1
she	1
to	1
the	1
gentleman	1
who	1
helped	1
her	1
to	1
mount	1
her	1
horse.	1
"I	1
must	1
call	1
to	1
some	1
of	1
them,	1
though,	1
and	1
leave	1
orders	1
where	1
they	1
are	1
to	1
join."	1
She	1
beckoned:	1
and	1
Hal,	1
who	1
was	1
foremost,	1
and	1
proud	1
to	1
show	1
his	1
alacrity,	1
ran	1
on	1
to	1
receive	1
her	1
ladyship's	1
orders.	1
Now,	1
as	1
we	1
have	1
before	1
observed,	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
sharp	1
and	1
windy	1
day;	1
and	1
though	1
Lady	1
Diana	1
Sweepstakes	1
was	1
actually	1
speaking	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
looking	1
at	1
him,	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
prevent	1
his	1
nose	1
from	1
wanting	1
to	1
be	1
blowed:	1
he	1
pulled	1
out	1
his	1
handkerchief	1
and	1
out	1
rolled	1
the	1
new	1
ball	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
given	1
to	1
him	1
just	1
before	1
he	1
left	1
home,	1
and	1
which,	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
usual	1
careless	1
habits,	1
he	1
had	1
stuffed	1
into	1
his	1
pockets	1
in	1
his	1
hurry.	1
"Oh,	1
my	1
new	1
ball!"	1
cried	1
he,	1
as	1
he	1
ran	1
after	1
it.	1
As	1
he	1
stopped	1
to	1
pick	1
it	1
up,	1
he	1
let	1
go	1
his	1
hat,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
hitherto	1
held	1
on	1
with	1
anxious	1
care;	1
for	1
the	1
hat,	1
though	1
it	1
had	1
a	1
fine	1
green	1
and	1
white	1
cockade,	1
had	1
no	1
band	1
or	1
string	1
round	1
it.	1
The	1
string,	1
as	1
we	1
may	1
recollect,	1
our	1
wasteful	1
hero	1
had	1
used	1
in	1
spinning	1
his	1
top.	1
The	1
hat	1
was	1
too	1
large	1
for	1
his	1
head	1
without	1
this	1
band;	1
a	1
sudden	1
gust	1
of	1
wind	1
blew	1
it	1
off.	1
Lady	1
Diana's	1
horse	1
started	1
and	1
reared.	1
She	1
was	1
a	1
FAMOUS	1
horse	1
woman,	1
and	1
sat	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
admiration	1
of	1
all	1
beholders;	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
puddle	1
of	1
red	1
clay	1
and	1
water	1
in	1
this	1
spot,	1
and	1
her	1
ladyship's	1
uniform	1
habit	1
was	1
a	1
sufferer	1
by	1
the	1
accident.	1
"Careless	1
brat!"	1
said	1
she,	1
"why	1
can't	1
he	1
keep	1
his	1
hat	1
upon	1
his	1
head?"	1
In	1
the	1
meantime,	1
the	1
wind	1
blew	1
the	1
hat	1
down	1
the	1
hill,	1
and	1
Hal	1
ran	1
after	1
it	1
amidst	1
the	1
laughter	1
of	1
his	1
kind	1
friends,	1
the	1
young	1
Sweepstakes,	1
and	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
regiment.	1
The	1
hat	1
was	1
lodged,	1
at	1
length,	1
upon	1
a	1
bank.	1
Hal	1
pursued	1
it:	1
he	1
thought	1
this	1
bank	1
was	1
hard,	1
but,	1
alas!	1
the	1
moment	1
he	1
set	1
his	1
foot	1
upon	1
it	1
the	1
foot	1
sank.	1
He	1
tried	1
to	1
draw	1
it	1
back;	1
his	1
other	1
foot	1
slipped,	1
and	1
he	1
fell	1
prostrate,	1
in	1
his	1
green	1
and	1
white	1
uniform,	1
into	1
the	1
treacherous	1
bed	1
of	1
red	1
mud.	1
His	1
companions,	1
who	1
had	1
halted	1
upon	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
hill,	1
stood	1
laughing,	1
spectators	1
of	1
his	1
misfortune.	1
It	1
happened	1
that	1
the	1
poor	1
boy	1
with	1
the	1
black	1
patch	1
upon	1
his	1
eye,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
ordered	1
by	1
Lady	1
Diana	1
to	1
"fall	1
back"	1
and	1
to	1
"keep	1
at	1
a	1
distance,"	1
was	1
now	1
coming	1
up	1
the	1
hill;	1
and	1
the	1
moment	1
he	1
saw	1
our	1
fallen	1
hero,	1
he	1
hastened	1
to	1
his	1
assistance.	1
He	1
dragged	1
poor	1
Hal,	1
who	1
was	1
a	1
deplorable	1
spectacle,	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
red	1
mud.	1
The	1
obliging	1
mistress	1
of	1
a	1
lodging	1
house,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
understood	1
that	1
the	1
young	1
gentleman	1
was	1
nephew	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Gresham,	1
to	1
whom	1
she	1
had	1
formerly	1
let	1
her	1
house,	1
received	1
Hal,	1
covered	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
with	1
dirt.	1
The	1
poor	1
Bristol	1
lad	1
hastened	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Gresham's	1
for	1
clean	1
stockings	1
and	1
shoes	1
for	1
Hal.	1
He	1
was	1
unwilling	1
to	1
give	1
up	1
his	1
uniform:	1
it	1
was	1
rubbed	1
and	1
rubbed,	1
and	1
a	1
spot	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
washed	1
out;	1
and	1
he	1
kept	1
continually	1
repeating,--"When	1
it's	1
dry	1
it	1
will	1
all	1
brush	1
off--when	1
it's	1
dry	1
it	1
will	1
all	1
brush	1
off,	1
won't	1
it?"	1
But	1
soon	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
being	1
too	1
late	1
at	1
the	1
archery	1
meeting	1
began	1
to	1
balance	1
the	1
dread	1
of	1
appearing	1
in	1
his	1
stained	1
habiliments;	1
and	1
he	1
now	1
as	1
anxiously	1
repeated,	1
whilst	1
the	1
woman	1
held	1
the	1
wet	1
coat	1
to	1
the	1
fire,	1
"Oh,	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
too	1
late;	1
indeed,	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
too	1
late;	1
make	1
haste;	1
it	1
will	1
never	1
dry;	1
hold	1
it	1
nearer--nearer	1
to	1
the	1
fire.	1
I	1
shall	1
lose	1
my	1
turn	1
to	1
shoot;	1
oh,	1
give	1
me	1
the	1
coat;	1
I	1
don't	1
mind	1
how	1
it	1
is,	1
if	1
I	1
can	1
but	1
get	1
it	1
on."	1
Holding	1
it	1
nearer	1
and	1
nearer	1
to	1
the	1
fire	1
dried	1
it	1
quickly,	1
to	1
be	1
sure;	1
but	1
it	1
shrunk	1
it	1
also,	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
no	1
easy	1
matter	1
to	1
get	1
the	1
coat	1
on	1
again.	1
However,	1
Hal,	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
the	1
red	1
splashes,	1
which,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
operations,	1
were	1
too	1
visible	1
upon	1
his	1
shoulders,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
skirts	1
of	1
his	1
white	1
coat	1
behind,	1
was	1
pretty	1
well	1
satisfied	1
to	1
observe	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
one	1
spot	1
upon	1
the	1
facings.	1
"Nobody,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"will	1
take	1
notice	1
of	1
my	1
coat	1
behind,	1
I	1
daresay.	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
looks	1
as	1
smart	1
almost	1
as	1
ever!"--and	1
under	1
this	1
persuasion	1
our	1
young	1
archer	1
resumed	1
his	1
bow--his	1
bow	1
with	1
green	1
ribands,	1
now	1
no	1
more!--and	1
he	1
pursued	1
his	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
Downs.	1
All	1
his	1
companions	1
were	1
far	1
out	1
of	1
sight.	1
"I	1
suppose,"	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
his	1
friend	1
with	1
the	1
black	1
patch--"I	1
suppose	1
my	1
uncle	1
and	1
Ben	1
had	1
left	1
home	1
before	1
you	1
went	1
for	1
the	1
shoes	1
and	1
stockings	1
for	1
me?"	1
"Oh,	1
yes,	1
sir;	1
the	1
butler	1
said	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
gone	1
to	1
the	1
Downs	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
a	1
good	1
half-hour	1
or	1
more."	1
Hal	1
trudged	1
on	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
he	1
possibly	1
could.	1
When	1
he	1
got	1
upon	1
the	1
Downs,	1
he	1
saw	1
numbers	1
of	1
carriages,	1
and	1
crowds	1
of	1
people,	1
all	1
going	1
towards	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
meeting	1
at	1
the	1
Ostrich.	1
He	1
pressed	1
forwards.	1
He	1
was	1
at	1
first	1
so	1
much	1
afraid	1
of	1
being	1
late,	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
take	1
notice	1
of	1
the	1
mirth	1
his	1
motley	1
appearance	1
excited	1
in	1
all	1
beholders.	1
At	1
length	1
he	1
reached	1
the	1
appointed	1
spot.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
crowd	1
of	1
people.	1
In	1
the	1
midst	1
he	1
heard	1
Lady	1
Diana's	1
loud	1
voice	1
betting	1
upon	1
someone	1
who	1
was	1
just	1
going	1
to	1
shoot	1
at	1
the	1
mark.	1
"So	1
then	1
the	1
shooting	1
is	1
begun,	1
is	1
it?"	1
said	1
Hal.	1
"Oh,	1
let	1
me	1
in!	1
pray	1
let	1
me	1
into	1
the	1
circle!	1
I'm	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
archers--I	1
am,	1
indeed;	1
don't	1
you	1
see	1
my	1
green	1
and	1
white	1
uniform?"	1
"Your	1
red	1
and	1
white	1
uniform,	1
you	1
mean,"	1
said	1
the	1
man	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
addressed	1
himself;	1
and	1
the	1
people,	1
as	1
they	1
opened	1
a	1
passage	1
for	1
him,	1
could	1
not	1
refrain	1
laughing	1
at	1
the	1
mixture	1
of	1
dirt	1
and	1
finery	1
which	1
it	1
exhibited.	1
In	1
vain,	1
when	1
he	1
got	1
into	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
formidable	1
circle,	1
he	1
looked	1
to	1
his	1
friends,	1
the	1
young	1
Sweepstakes,	1
for	1
their	1
countenance	1
and	1
support.	1
They	1
were	1
amongst	1
the	1
most	1
unmerciful	1
of	1
the	1
laughers.	1
Lady	1
Diana	1
also	1
seemed	1
more	1
to	1
enjoy	1
than	1
to	1
pity	1
his	1
confusion.	1
"Why	1
could	1
you	1
not	1
keep	1
your	1
hat	1
upon	1
your	1
head,	1
man?"	1
said	1
she,	1
in	1
her	1
masculine	1
tone.	1
"You	1
have	1
been	1
almost	1
the	1
ruin	1
of	1
my	1
poor	1
uniform	1
habit;	1
but	1
I've	1
escaped	1
rather	1
better	1
than	1
you	1
have.	1
Don't	1
stand	1
there,	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
circle,	1
or	1
you'll	1
have	1
an	1
arrow	1
in	1
your	1
eyes	1
just	1
now,	1
I've	1
a	1
notion."	1
Hal	1
looked	1
round	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
better	1
friends.	1
"Oh,	1
where's	1
my	1
uncle?--	1
where's	1
Ben?"	1
said	1
he.	1
He	1
was	1
in	1
such	1
confusion,	1
that,	1
amongst	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
faces,	1
he	1
could	1
scarcely	1
distinguish	1
one	1
from	1
another;	1
but	1
he	1
felt	1
somebody	1
at	1
this	1
moment	1
pull	1
his	1
elbow,	1
and,	1
to	1
his	1
great	1
relief,	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
friendly	1
voice,	1
and	1
saw	1
the	1
good	1
natured	1
face	1
of	1
his	1
Cousin	1
Ben.	1
"Come	1
back;	1
come	1
behind	1
these	1
people,"	1
said	1
Ben,	1
"and	1
put	1
on	1
my	1
great-	1
coat;	1
here	1
it	1
is	1
for	1
you."	1
Right	1
glad	1
was	1
Hal	1
to	1
cover	1
his	1
disgraced	1
uniform	1
with	1
the	1
rough	1
great-	1
coat	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
formerly	1
despised.	1
He	1
pulled	1
the	1
stained,	1
drooping	1
cockade	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
unfortunate	1
hat;	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
now	1
sufficiently	1
recovered	1
from	1
his	1
vexation	1
to	1
give	1
an	1
intelligible	1
account	1
of	1
his	1
accident	1
to	1
his	1
uncle	1
and	1
Patty,	1
who	1
anxiously	1
inquired	1
what	1
had	1
detained	1
him	1
so	1
long,	1
and	1
what	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
matter.	1
In	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
his	1
disaster,	1
he	1
was	1
just	1
proving	1
to	1
Patty	1
that	1
his	1
taking	1
the	1
hatband	1
to	1
spin	1
his	1
top	1
had	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
his	1
misfortune,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
endeavouring	1
to	1
refute	1
his	1
uncle's	1
opinion	1
that	1
the	1
waste	1
of	1
the	1
whipcord	1
that	1
tied	1
the	1
parcel	1
was	1
the	1
original	1
cause	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
evils,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
summoned	1
to	1
try	1
his	1
skill	1
with	1
his	1
FAMOUS	1
bow.	1
"My	1
hands	1
are	1
benumbed;	1
I	1
can	1
scarcely	1
feel,"	1
said	1
he,	1
rubbing	1
them,	1
and	1
blowing	1
upon	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
his	1
fingers.	1
"Come,	1
come,"	1
cried	1
young	1
Sweepstakes,	1
"I'm	1
within	1
one	1
inch	1
of	1
the	1
mark;	1
who'll	1
go	1
nearer?	1
I	1
shall	1
like	1
to	1
see.	1
Shoot	1
away,	1
Hal;	1
but	1
first	1
understand	1
our	1
laws;	1
we	1
settled	1
them	1
before	1
you	1
came	1
upon	1
the	1
green.	1
You	1
are	1
to	1
have	1
three	1
shots,	1
with	1
your	1
own	1
bow	1
and	1
your	1
own	1
arrows;	1
and	1
nobody's	1
to	1
borrow	1
or	1
lend	1
under	1
pretence	1
of	1
other's	1
bows	1
being	1
better	1
or	1
worse,	1
or	1
under	1
any	1
pretence.	1
Do	1
you	1
hear,	1
Hal?"	1
This	1
young	1
gentleman	1
had	1
good	1
reasons	1
for	1
being	1
so	1
strict	1
in	1
these	1
laws,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
observed	1
that	1
none	1
of	1
his	1
companions	1
had	1
such	1
an	1
excellent	1
bow	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
provided	1
for	1
himself.	1
Some	1
of	1
the	1
boys	1
had	1
forgotten	1
to	1
bring	1
more	1
than	1
one	1
arrow	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
by	1
his	1
cunning	1
regulation	1
that	1
each	1
person	1
should	1
shoot	1
with	1
their	1
own	1
arrows,	1
many	1
had	1
lost	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
of	1
their	1
shots.	1
"You	1
are	1
a	1
lucky	1
fellow;	1
you	1
have	1
your	1
three	1
arrows,"	1
said	1
young	1
Sweepstakes.	1
"Come,	1
we	1
can't	1
wait	1
whilst	1
you	1
rub	1
your	1
fingers,	1
man--	1
shoot	1
away."	1
Hal	1
was	1
rather	1
surprised	1
at	1
the	1
asperity	1
with	1
which	1
his	1
friend	1
spoke.	1
He	1
little	1
knew	1
how	1
easily	1
acquaintance	1
who	1
call	1
themselves	1
friends	1
can	1
change	1
when	1
their	1
interest	1
comes	1
in	1
the	1
slightest	1
degree	1
in	1
competition	1
with	1
their	1
friendship.	1
Hurried	1
by	1
his	1
impatient	1
rival,	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
hands	1
so	1
much	1
benumbed	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
scarcely	1
feel	1
how	1
to	1
fix	1
the	1
arrow	1
in	1
the	1
string,	1
he	1
drew	1
the	1
bow.	1
The	1
arrow	1
was	1
within	1
a	1
quarter	1
of	1
an	1
inch	1
of	1
Master	1
Sweepstakes'	1
mark,	1
which	1
was	1
the	1
nearest	1
that	1
had	1
yet	1
been	1
hit.	1
Hal	1
seized	1
his	1
second	1
arrow.	1
"If	1
I	1
have	1
any	1
luck--"	1
said	1
he.	1
But	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
pronounced	1
the	1
word	1
LUCK,	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
bent	1
his	1
bow,	1
the	1
string	1
broke	1
in	1
two,	1
and	1
the	1
bow	1
fell	1
from	1
his	1
hands.	1
"There,	1
it's	1
all	1
over	1
with	1
you!"	1
cried	1
Master	1
Sweepstakes,	1
with	1
a	1
triumphant	1
laugh.	1
"Here's	1
my	1
bow	1
for	1
him,	1
and	1
welcome,"	1
said	1
Ben.	1
"No,	1
no,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
Master	1
Sweepstakes,	1
"that	1
is	1
not	1
fair;	1
that's	1
against	1
the	1
regulation.	1
You	1
may	1
shoot	1
with	1
your	1
own	1
bow,	1
if	1
you	1
choose	1
it,	1
or	1
you	1
may	1
not,	1
just	1
as	1
you	1
think	1
proper;	1
but	1
you	1
must	1
not	1
lend	1
it,	1
sir."	1
It	1
was	1
now	1
Ben's	1
turn	1
to	1
make	1
his	1
trial.	1
His	1
first	1
arrow	1
was	1
not	1
successful.	1
His	1
second	1
was	1
exactly	1
as	1
near	1
as	1
Hal's	1
first.	1
"You	1
have	1
but	1
one	1
more,"	1
said	1
Master	1
Sweepstakes--"now	1
for	1
it!"	1
Ben,	1
before	1
he	1
ventured	1
his	1
last	1
arrow,	1
prudently	1
examined	1
the	1
string	1
of	1
his	1
bow;	1
and,	1
as	1
he	1
pulled	1
it	1
to	1
try	1
its	1
strength,	1
it	1
cracked.	1
Master	1
Sweepstakes	1
clapped	1
his	1
hands	1
with	1
loud	1
exultations	1
and	1
insulting	1
laughter.	1
But	1
his	1
laughter	1
ceased	1
when	1
our	1
provident	1
hero	1
calmly	1
drew	1
from	1
his	1
pocket	1
an	1
excellent	1
piece	1
of	1
whip	1
cord.	1
"The	1
everlasting	1
whip	1
cord,	1
I	1
declare!"	1
exclaimed	1
Hal,	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
very	1
same	1
that	1
had	1
tied	1
up	1
the	1
parcel.	1
"Yes,"	1
said	1
Ben,	1
as	1
he	1
fastened	1
it	1
to	1
his	1
bow,	1
"I	1
put	1
it	1
into	1
my	1
pocket,	1
to-day,	1
on	1
purpose,	1
because	1
I	1
thought	1
I	1
might	1
happen	1
to	1
want	1
it."	1
He	1
drew	1
his	1
bow	1
the	1
third	1
and	1
last	1
time.	1
"Oh,	1
papa!"	1
cried	1
little	1
Patty,	1
as	1
his	1
arrow	1
hit	1
the	1
mark,	1
"it's	1
the	1
nearest;	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
the	1
nearest?"	1
Master	1
Sweepstakes,	1
with	1
anxiety,	1
examined	1
the	1
hit.	1
There	1
could	1
be	1
no	1
doubt.	1
Ben	1
was	1
victorious!	1
The	1
bow,	1
the	1
prize	1
bow,	1
was	1
now	1
delivered	1
to	1
him;	1
and	1
Hal,	1
as	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
whip-cord	1
exclaimed,	1
"How	1
LUCKY	1
this	1
whip-cord	1
has	1
been	1
to	1
you,	1
Ben!"	1
"It	1
is	1
LUCKY,	1
perhaps	1
you	1
mean,	1
that	1
he	1
took	1
care	1
of	1
it,"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Gresham.	1
"Ay,"	1
said	1
Hal,	1
"very	1
true;	1
he	1
might	1
well	1
say,	1
'Waste	1
not,	1
want	1
not.'	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
good	1
thing	1
to	1
have	1
two	1
strings	1
to	1
one's	1
bow."	1

SCENE	1

The	1

hall--Lucy	1
watering	1
some	1
myrtles--A	1
servant	1
behind	1
the	1
scenes	1
is	1
heard	1
to	1
say--	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
my	1
master	1
is	1
not	1
up.	1
You	1
can't	1
see	1
him,	1
so	1
go	1
about	1
your	1
business,	1
I	1
say.	1
Lucy.	1
To	1
whom	1
are	1
you	1
speaking,	1
William?	1
Who's	1
that?	1
Will.	1
Only	1
an	1
old	1
man,	1
miss,	1
with	1
a	1
complaint	1
for	1
my	1
master.	1
Lucy.	1
Oh,	1
then,	1
don't	1
send	1
him	1
away--don't	1
send	1
him	1
away.	1
Will.	1
But	1
master	1
has	1
not	1
had	1
his	1
chocolate,	1
ma'am.	1
He	1
won't	1
ever	1
see	1
anybody	1
before	1
he	1
drinks	1
his	1
chocolate,	1
you	1
know,	1
ma'am.	1
Lucy.	1
But	1
let	1
the	1
old	1
man,	1
then,	1
come	1
in	1
here.	1
Perhaps	1
he	1
can	1
wait	1
a	1
little	1
while.	1
Call	1
him.	1
(Exit	1
Servant.)	1
(Lucy	1
sings,	1
and	1
goes	1
on	1
watering	1
her	1
myrtles;	1
the	1
servant	1
shows	1
in	1
the	1
Old	1
Man.)	1
Will.	1
You	1
can't	1
see	1
my	1
master	1
this	1
hour;	1
but	1
miss	1
will	1
let	1
you	1
stay	1
here.	1
Lucy	1
(aside).	1
Poor	1
old	1
man!	1
how	1
he	1
trembles	1
as	1
he	1
walks.	1
(Aloud.)	1
Sit	1
down,	1
sit	1
down.	1
My	1
father	1
will	1
see	1
you	1
soon;	1
pray	1
sit	1
down.	1
(He	1
hesitates;	1
she	1
pushes	1
a	1
chair	1
towards	1
him.)	1
Lucy.	1
Pray	1
sit	1
down.	1
(He	1
sits	1
down.)	1
Old	1
Man.	1
You	1
are	1
very	1
good,	1
miss;	1
very	1
good.	1
(Lucy	1
goes	1
to	1
her	1
myrtles	1
again.)	1
Lucy.	1
Ah!	1
I'm	1
afraid	1
this	1
poor	1
myrtle	1
is	1
quite	1
dead--quite	1
dead.	1
(The	1
Old	1
Man	1
sighs,	1
and	1
she	1
turns	1
round.)	1
Lucy	1
(aside).	1
I	1
wonder	1
what	1
can	1
make	1
him	1
sigh	1
so!	1
(Aloud.)	1
My	1
father	1
won't	1
make	1
you	1
wait	1
long.	1
Old	1
M.	1
Oh,	1
ma'am,	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
he	1
pleases.	1
I'm	1
in	1
no	1
haste--no	1
haste.	1
It's	1
only	1
a	1
small	1
matter.	1
Lucy.	1
But	1
does	1
a	1
small	1
matter	1
make	1
you	1
sigh	1
so?	1
Old	1
M.	1
Ah,	1
miss;	1
because,	1
though	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
small	1
matter	1
in	1
itself,	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
small	1
matter	1
to	1
me	1
(sighing	1
again);	1
it	1
was	1
my	1
all,	1
and	1
I've	1
lost	1
it.	1
Lucy.	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
mean?	1
What	1
have	1
you	1
lost?	1
Old	1
M.	1
Why,	1
miss--but	1
I	1
won't	1
trouble	1
you	1
about	1
it.	1
Lucy.	1
But	1
it	1
won't	1
trouble	1
me	1
at	1
all--I	1
mean,	1
I	1
wish	1
to	1
hear	1
it;	1
so	1
tell	1
it	1
me.	1
Old	1
M.	1
Why,	1
miss,	1
I	1
slept	1
last	1
night	1
at	1
the	1
inn	1
here,	1
in	1
town--the	1
"Saracen's	1
Head"--	1
Lucy	1
(interrupts	1
him).	1
Hark!	1
there	1
is	1
my	1
father	1
coming	1
downstairs;	1
follow	1
me.	1
You	1
may	1
tell	1
me	1
your	1
story	1
as	1
we	1
go	1
along.	1
Old	1
M.	1
I	1
slept	1
at	1

(Exit,	1
talking.)	1
SCENE	1
II.	1
Justice	1
Headstrong's	1
Study.	1
(He	1
appears	1
in	1
his	1
nightgown	1
and	1
cap,	1
with	1
his	1
gouty	1
foot	1
upon	1
a	1
stool--a	1
table	1
and	1
chocolate	1
beside	1
him--Lucy	1
is	1
leaning	1
on	1
the	1
arm	1
of	1
his	1
chair.)	1
Just.	1
Well,	1
well,	1
my	1
darling,	1
presently;	1
I'll	1
see	1
him	1
presently.	1
Lucy.	1
Whilst	1
you	1
are	1
drinking	1
your	1
chocolate,	1
papa?	1
Just.	1
No,	1
no,	1
no--I	1
never	1
see	1
anybody	1
till	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
my	1
chocolate,	1
darling.	1
(He	1
tastes	1
his	1
chocolate.)	1
There's	1
no	1
sugar	1
in	1
this,	1
child.	1
Lucy.	1
Yes,	1
indeed,	1
papa.	1
Just.	1
No,	1
child--there's	1
NO	1
sugar,	1
I	1
tell	1
you;	1
that	1
poz!	1
Lucy.	1
Oh,	1
but,	1
papa,	1
I	1
assure	1
you	1
I	1
put	1
in	1
two	1
lumps	1
myself.	1
Just.	1
There's	1
NO	1
sugar,	1
I	1
say;	1
why	1
will	1
you	1
contradict	1
me,	1
child,	1
for	1
ever?	1
There's	1
no	1
sugar,	1
I	1
say.	1
(Lucy	1
leans	1
over	1
him	1
playfully,	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
teaspoon	1
pulls	1
out	1
two	1
lumps	1
of	1
sugar.)	1
Lucy.	1
What's	1
this,	1
papa?	1
Just.	1
Pshaw!	1
pshaw!	1
pshaw!--it	1
is	1
not	1
melted,	1
child--it	1
is	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
no	1
sugar!.--Oh,	1
my	1
foot,	1
girl,	1
my	1
foot!--you	1
kill	1
me.	1
Go,	1
go,	1
I'm	1
busy.	1
I've	1
business	1
to	1
do.	1
Go	1
and	1
send	1
William	1
to	1
me;	1
do	1
you	1
hear,	1
love?	1
Lucy.	1
And	1
the	1
old	1
man,	1
papa?	1
Just.	1
What	1
old	1
man?	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
what,	1
I've	1
been	1
plagued	1
ever	1
since	1
I	1
was	1
awake,	1
and	1
before	1
I	1
was	1
awake,	1
about	1
that	1
old	1
man.	1
If	1
he	1
can't	1
wait,	1
let	1
him	1
go	1
about	1
his	1
business.	1
Don't	1
you	1
know,	1
child,	1
I	1
never	1
see	1
anybody	1
till	1
I've	1
drunk	1
my	1
chocolate;	1
and	1
I	1
never	1
will,	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
duke--that's	1
poz!	1
Why,	1
it	1
has	1
but	1
just	1
struck	1
twelve;	1
if	1
he	1
can't	1
wait,	1
he	1
can	1
go	1
about	1
his	1
business,	1
can't	1
he?	1
Lucy.	1
Oh,	1
sir,	1
he	1
can	1
wait.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
he	1
who	1
was	1
impatient.	1
(She	1
comes	1
back	1
playfully.)	1
It	1
was	1
only	1
I,	1
papa;	1
don't	1
be	1
angry.	1
Just.	1
Well,	1
well,	1
well	1
(finishing	1
his	1
cup	1
of	1
chocolate,	1
and	1
pushing	1
his	1
dish	1
away);	1
and	1
at	1
anyrate	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
sugar	1
enough.	1
Send	1
William,	1
send	1
William,	1
child;	1
and	1
I'll	1
finish	1
my	1
own	1
business,	1
and	1
then--	1
(Exit	1
Lucy,	1
dancing,	1
"And	1
then!--and	1
then!")	1
JUSTICE,	1
alone.	1
Just.	1
Oh,	1
this	1
foot	1
of	1
mine!--(twinges)--Oh,	1
this	1
foot!	1
Ay,	1
if	1
Dr.	1
Sparerib	1
could	1
cure	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
gout,	1
then,	1
indeed,	1
I	1
should	1
think	1
something	1
of	1
him;	1
but,	1
as	1
to	1
my	1
leaving	1
off	1
my	1
bottle	1
of	1
port,	1
it's	1
nonsense;	1
it's	1
all	1
nonsense;	1
I	1
can't	1
do	1
it;	1
I	1
can't,	1
and	1
won't,	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
Dr.	1
Spareribs	1
in	1
Christendom;	1
that's	1
poz!	1
Enter	1
WILLIAM.	1
Just.	1
William--oh!	1
ay!	1
hey!	1
what	1
answer,	1
pray,	1
did	1
you	1
bring	1
from	1
the	1
"Saracen's	1
Head"?	1
Did	1
you	1
see	1
Mrs.	1
Bustle	1
herself,	1
as	1
I	1
bid	1
you?	1
Will.	1
Yes,	1
sir,	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
landlady	1
herself;	1
she	1
said	1
she	1
would	1
come	1
up	1
immediately,	1
sir.	1
Just.	1
Ah,	1
that's	1
well--immediately?	1
Will.	1
Yes,	1
sir,	1
and	1
I	1
hear	1
her	1
voice	1
below	1
now.	1
Just.	1
Oh,	1
show	1
her	1
up;	1
show	1
Mrs.	1
Bustle	1
in.	1
Enter	1
Mrs.	1
BUSTLE,	1
the	1
landlady	1
of	1
the	1
"Saracen's	1
Head."	1
Land.	1
Good	1
morrow	1
to	1
your	1
worship!	1
I'm	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
your	1
worship	1
look	1
so	1
purely.	1
I	1
came	1
up	1
with	1
all	1
speed	1
(taking	1
breath).	1
Our	1
pie	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
oven;	1
that	1
was	1
what	1
you	1
sent	1
for	1
me	1
about,	1
I	1
take	1
it.	1
Just.	1
True;	1
true;	1
sit	1
down,	1
good	1
Mrs.	1
Bustle,	1
pray--	1
Land.	1
Oh,	1
your	1
worship's	1
always	1
very	1
good	1
(settling	1
her	1
apron).	1
I	1
came	1
up	1
just	1
as	1
I	1
was--only	1
threw	1
my	1
shawl	1
over	1
me.	1
I	1
thought	1
your	1
worship	1
would	1
excuse--I'm	1
quite,	1
as	1
it	1
were,	1
rejoiced	1
to	1
see	1
your	1
worship	1
look	1
so	1
purely,	1
and	1
to	1
find	1
you	1
up	1
so	1
hearty--	1
Just.	1
Oh,	1
I'm	1
very	1
hearty	1
(coughing),	1
always	1
hearty,	1
and	1
thankful	1
for	1
it.	1
I	1
hope	1
to	1
see	1
many	1
Christmas	1
doings	1
yet,	1
Mrs.	1
Bustle.	1
And	1
so	1
our	1
pie	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
oven,	1
I	1
think	1
you	1
say?	1
Land.	1
In	1
the	1
oven	1
it	1
is.	1
I	1
put	1
it	1
in	1
with	1
my	1
own	1
hands;	1
and	1
if	1
we	1
have	1
but	1
good	1
luck	1
in	1
the	1
baking,	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
as	1
pretty	1
a	1
goose-pie--though	1
I	1
say	1
it	1
that	1
should	1
not	1
say	1
it--as	1
pretty	1
a	1
goose-pie	1
as	1
ever	1
your	1
worship	1
set	1
your	1
eyes	1
upon.	1
Just.	1
Will	1
you	1
take	1
a	1
glass	1
of	1
anything	1
this	1
morning,	1
Mrs.	1
Bustle?--I	1
have	1
some	1
nice	1
usquebaugh.	1
Land.	1
Oh,	1
no,	1
your	1
worship!--I	1
thank	1
your	1
worship,	1
though,	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
if	1
I	1
took	1
it;	1
but	1
I	1
just	1
took	1
my	1
luncheon	1
before	1
I	1
came	1
up;	1
or	1
more	1
proper,	1
MY	1
SANDWICH,	1
I	1
should	1
say,	1
for	1
the	1
fashion's	1
sake,	1
to	1
be	1
sure.	1
A	1
LUNCHEON	1
won't	1
go	1
down	1
with	1
nobody	1
nowadays	1
(laughs).	1
I	1
expect	1
hostler	1
and	1
boots	1
will	1
be	1
calling	1
for	1
their	1
sandwiches	1
just	1
now	1
(laughs	1
again).	1
I'm	1
sure	1
I	1
beg	1
your	1
worship's	1
pardon	1
for	1
mentioning	1
a	1
LUNCHEON.	1
Just.	1
Oh,	1
Mrs.	1
Bustle,	1
the	1
word's	1
a	1
good	1
word,	1
for	1
it	1
means	1
a	1
good	1
thing--ha!	1
ha!	1
ha!	1
(pulls	1
out	1
his	1
watch);	1
but	1
pray,	1
is	1
it	1
luncheon	1
time.	1
Why,	1
it's	1
past	1
one,	1
I	1
declare;	1
and	1
I	1
thought	1
I	1
was	1
up	1
in	1
remarkably	1
good	1
time,	1
too.	1
Land.	1
Well,	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
sure	1
so	1
it	1
was,	1
remarkably	1
good	1
time	1
for	1
your	1
worship;	1
but	1
folks	1
in	1
our	1
way	1
must	1
be	1
up	1
betimes,	1
you	1
know.	1
I've	1
been	1
up	1
and	1
about	1
these	1
seven	1
hours!	1
Just.	1
(stretching).	1
Seven	1
hours!	1
Land.	1
Ay,	1
indeed--eight,	1
I	1
might	1
say,	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
an	1
early	1
little	1
body;	1
though	1
I	1
say	1
it	1
that	1
should	1
not	1
say	1
it--I	1
AM	1
an	1
early	1
little	1
body.	1
Just.	1
An	1
early	1
little	1
body,	1
as	1
you	1
say,	1
Mrs.	1
Bustle;	1
so	1
I	1
shall	1
have	1
my	1
goose-pie	1
for	1
dinner,	1
hey?	1
Land.	1
For	1
dinner,	1
as	1
sure	1
as	1
the	1
clock	1
strikes	1
four--but	1
I	1
mustn't	1
stay	1
prating,	1
for	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
spoiling	1
if	1
I'm	1
away;	1
so	1
I	1
must	1
wish	1
your	1
worship	1
a	1
good	1
morning.	1
(She	1
curtsies.)	1
Just.	1
No	1
ceremony--no	1
ceremony;	1
good	1
Mrs.	1
Bustle,	1
your	1
servant.	1
Enter	1
William,	1
to	1
take	1
away	1
the	1
chocolate.	1
The	1
Landlady	1
is	1
putting	1
on	1
her	1
shawl.	1
Just.	1
You	1
may	1
let	1
that	1
man	1
know,	1
William,	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
dispatched	1
my	1
OWN	1
business,	1
and	1
am	1
at	1
leisure	1
for	1
his	1
now	1
(taking	1
a	1
pinch	1
of	1
snuff).	1
Hum!	1
pray,	1
William	1
(Justice	1
leans	1
back	1
gravely),	1
what	1
sort	1
of	1
a	1
looking	1
fellow	1
is	1
he,	1
pray?	1
Will.	1
Most	1
like	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
travelling	1
man,	1
in	1
my	1
opinion,	1
sir--or	1
something	1
that	1
way,	1
I	1
take	1
it,	1
(At	1
these	1
words	1
the	1
landlady	1
turns	1
round	1
inquisitively,	1
and	1
delays,	1
that	1
she	1
may	1
listen,	1
while	1
she	1
is	1
putting	1
on	1
and	1
pinning	1
her	1
shawl.)	1
Just.	1
Hum!	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
a	1
travelling	1
man.	1
Hum!	1
lay	1
my	1
books	1
out	1
open	1
at	1
the	1
title	1
Vagrant;	1
and,	1
William,	1
tell	1
the	1
cook	1
that	1
Mrs.	1
Bustle	1
promises	1
me	1
the	1
goose-pie	1
for	1
dinner.	1
Four	1
o'clock,	1
do	1
you	1
hear?	1
And	1
show	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
in	1
now.	1
(The	1
Landlady	1
looks	1
eagerly	1
towards	1
the	1
door,	1
as	1
it	1
opens,	1
and	1
exclaims,)	1
Land.	1
My	1
old	1
gentleman,	1
as	1
I	1
hope	1
to	1
breathe!	1
Enter	1
the	1
OLD	1
MAN.	1
(Lucy	1
follows	1
the	1
Old	1
Man	1
on	1
tiptoe--The	1
Justice	1
leans	1
back	1
and	1
looks	1
consequential--The	1
Landlady	1
sets	1
her	1
arms	1
akimbo--The	1
Old	1
Man	1
starts	1
as	1
he	1
sees	1
her.)	1
Just.	1
What	1
stops	1
you,	1
friend?	1
Come	1
forward,	1
if	1
you	1
please.	1
Land.	1
(advancing).	1
So,	1
sir,	1
is	1
it	1
you,	1
sir?	1
Ay,	1
you	1
little	1
thought,	1
I	1
warrant	1
ye,	1
to	1
meet	1
me	1
here	1
with	1
his	1
worship;	1
but	1
there	1
you	1
reckoned	1
without	1
your	1
host--Out	1
of	1
the	1
frying-pan	1
into	1
the	1
fire.	1
Just.	1
What	1
is	1
all	1
this?	1
What	1
is	1
this?	1
Land.	1
(running	1
on).	1
None	1
of	1
your	1
flummery	1
stuff	1
will	1
go	1
down	1
with	1
his	1
worship	1
no	1
more	1
than	1
with	1
me,	1
I	1
give	1
you	1
warning;	1
so	1
you	1
may	1
go	1
further	1
and	1
fare	1
worse,	1
and	1
spare	1
your	1
breath	1
to	1
cool	1
your	1
porridge.	1
Just.	1
(waves	1
his	1
hand	1
with	1
dignity).	1
Mrs.	1
Bustle,	1
good	1
Mrs.	1
Bustle,	1
remember	1
where	1
you	1
are.	1
Silence!	1
silence!	1
Come	1
forward,	1
sir,	1
and	1
let	1
me	1
hear	1
what	1
you	1
have	1
to	1
say.	1
(The	1
Old	1
Man	1
comes	1
forward.)	1
Just.	1
Who	1
and	1
what	1
may	1
you	1
be,	1
friend,	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
your	1
business	1
with	1
me?	1
Land.	1
Sir,	1
if	1
your	1
worship	1
will	1
give	1
me	1
leave--	1
(Justice	1
makes	1
a	1
sign	1
to	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
silent).	1
Old	1
M.	1
Please,	1
your	1
worship,	1
I	1
am	1
an	1
old	1
soldier.	1
Land.	1
(interrupting).	1
An	1
old	1
hypocrite,	1
say.	1
Just.	1
Mrs.	1
Bustle,	1
pray,	1
I	1
desire,	1
let	1
the	1
man	1
speak.	1
Old	1
M.	1
For	1
these	1
two	1
years	1
past--ever	1
since,	1
please	1
your	1
worship--I	1
wasn't	1
able	1
to	1
work	1
any	1
longer;	1
for	1
in	1
my	1
youth	1
I	1
did	1
work	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
them.	1
Land.	1
(eager	1
to	1
interrupt).	1
You	1
work--you--	1
Just.	1
Let	1
him	1
finish	1
his	1
story,	1
I	1
say.	1
Lucy.	1
Ay,	1
do,	1
do,	1
papa,	1
speak	1
for	1
him.	1
Pray,	1
Mrs.	1
Bustle--	1
Land.	1
(turning	1
suddenly	1
round	1
to	1
Lucy).	1
Miss,	1
a	1
good	1
morrow	1
to	1
you,	1
ma'am.	1
I	1
humbly	1
beg	1
your	1
apologies	1
for	1
not	1
seeing	1
you	1
sooner,	1
Miss	1
Lucy.	1
(Justice	1
nods	1
to	1
the	1
Old	1
Man,	1
who	1
goes	1
on.)	1
Old	1
Man.	1
But	1
please	1
your	1
worship,	1
it	1
pleased	1
God	1
to	1
take	1
away	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
my	1
left	1
arm;	1
and	1
since	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
work.	1
Land.	1
Flummery!	1
flummery!	1
Just.	1
(angrily).	1
Mrs.	1
Bustle,	1
I	1
have	1
desired	1
silence,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
have	1
it,	1
that's	1
poz!	1
You	1
shall	1
have	1
your	1
turn	1
presently.	1
Old	1
M.	1
For	1
these	1
two	1
years	1
past	1
(for	1
why	1
should	1
I	1
be	1
ashamed	1
to	1
tell	1
the	1
truth?)	1
I	1
have	1
lived	1
upon	1
charity,	1
and	1
I	1
scraped	1
together	1
a	1
guinea	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
and	1
upwards,	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
travelling	1
with	1
it	1
to	1
my	1
grandson,	1
in	1
the	1
north,	1
with	1
him	1
to	1
end	1
my	1
days--but	1
(sighing)--	1
Just.	1
But	1
what?	1
Proceed,	1
pray,	1
to	1
the	1
point.	1
Old	1
M.	1
But	1
last	1
night	1
I	1
slept	1
here	1
in	1
town,	1
please	1
your	1
worship,	1
at	1
the	1
"Saracen's	1
Head."	1
Land.	1
(in	1
a	1
rage).	1
At	1
the	1
"Saracen's	1
Head"!	1
Yes,	1
forsooth!	1
none	1
such	1
ever	1
slept	1
at	1
the	1
"Saracen's	1
Head"	1
afore,	1
or	1
shall	1
afterwards,	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
my	1
name's	1
Bustle,	1
and	1
the	1
"Saracen's	1
Head"	1
is	1
the	1
"Saracen's	1
Head."	1
Just.	1
Again!	1
again!	1
Mrs.	1
Landlady,	1
this	1
is	1
downright--I	1
have	1
said	1
you	1
should	1
speak	1
presently.	1
He	1
SHALL	1
speak	1
first,	1
since	1
I've	1
said	1
it--that's	1
poz!	1
Speak	1
on,	1
friend.	1
You	1
slept	1
last	1
night	1
at	1
the	1
"Saracen's	1
Head."	1
Old	1
M.	1
Yes,	1
please	1
your	1
worship,	1
and	1
I	1
accuse	1
nobody;	1
but	1
at	1
night	1
I	1
had	1
my	1
little	1
money	1
safe,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
it	1
was	1
gone.	1
Land.	1
Gone!--gone,	1
indeed,	1
in	1
my	1
house!	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
way	1
I'm	1
to	1
be	1
treated!	1
Is	1
it	1
so?	1
I	1
couldn't	1
but	1
speak,	1
your	1
worship,	1
to	1
such	1
an	1
inhuman	1
like,	1
out	1
o'	1
the	1
way,	1
scandalous	1
charge,	1
if	1
King	1
George	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
Royal	1
Family	1
were	1
sitting	1
in	1
your	1
worship's	1
chair,	1
beside	1
you,	1
to	1
silence	1
me	1
(turning	1
to	1
the	1
Old	1
Man).	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
your	1
gratitude,	1
forsooth!	1
Didn't	1
you	1
tell	1
me	1
that	1
any	1
hole	1
in	1
my	1
house	1
was	1
good	1
enough	1
for	1
you,	1
wheedling	1
hypocrite?	1
And	1
the	1
thanks	1
I	1
receive	1
is	1
to	1
call	1
me	1
and	1
mine	1
a	1
pack	1
of	1
thieves.	1
Old	1
M.	1
Oh,	1
no,	1
no,	1
no,	1
NO--a	1
pack	1
of	1
thieves,	1
by	1
no	1
means.	1
Land.	1
Ay,	1
I	1
thought	1
when	1
_I_	1
came	1
to	1
speak	1
we	1
should	1
have	1
you	1
upon	1
your	1
marrow-bones	1
in--	1
Just.	1
(imperiously).	1
Silence!	1
Five	1
times	1
have	1
I	1
commanded	1
silence,	1
and	1
five	1
times	1
in	1
vain;	1
and	1
I	1
won't	1
command	1
anything	1
five	1
times	1
in	1
vain--	1
THAT'S	1
POZ!	1
Land.	1
(in	1
a	1
pet,	1
aside).	1
Old	1
Poz!	1
(aloud).	1
Then,	1
your	1
worship,	1
I	1
don't	1
see	1
any	1
business	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
be	1
waiting	1
here;	1
the	1
folks	1
want	1
me	1
at	1
home	1
(returning	1
and	1
whispering).	1
Shall	1
I	1
send	1
the	1
goose-pie	1
up,	1
your	1
worship,	1
if	1
it's	1
ready?	1
Just.	1
(with	1
magnanimity).	1
I	1
care	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
goose-pie,	1
Mrs.	1
Bustle.	1
Do	1
not	1
talk	1
to	1
me	1
of	1
goose-pies;	1
this	1
is	1

Oh,	1

your	1

JUSTICE	1
HEADSTRONG,	1
OLD	1
MAN	1
and	1
LUCY.	1
Lucy.	1
Ah,	1
now,	1
I'm	1
glad	1
he	1
can	1
speak;	1
now	1
tell	1
papa;	1
and	1
you	1
need	1
not	1
be	1
afraid	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
him,	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
very	1
good-natured.	1
Don't	1
contradict	1
him,	1
though,	1
because	1
he	1
told	1
ME	1
not.	1
Just.	1
Oh,	1
darling,	1
YOU	1
shall	1
contradict	1
me	1
as	1
often	1
as	1
you	1
please--only	1
not	1
before	1
I've	1
drunk	1
my	1
chocolate,	1
child--hey!	1
Go	1
on,	1
my	1
good	1
friend;	1
you	1
see	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
live	1
in	1
Old	1
England,	1
where,	1
thank	1
Heaven,	1
the	1
poorest	1
of	1
His	1
Majesty's	1
subjects	1
may	1
have	1
justice,	1
and	1
speak	1
his	1
mind	1
before	1
the	1
first	1
in	1
the	1
land.	1
Now	1
speak	1
on;	1
and	1
you	1
hear	1
she	1
tells	1
you	1
that	1
you	1
need	1
not	1
be	1
afraid	1
of	1
me.	1
Speak	1
on.	1
Old	1
M.	1
I	1
thank	1
your	1
worship,	1
I'm	1
sure.	1
Just.	1
Thank	1
me!	1
for	1
what,	1
sir?	1
I	1
won't	1
be	1
thanked	1
for	1
doing	1
justice,	1
sir;	1
so--but	1
explain	1
this	1
matter.	1
You	1
lost	1
your	1
money,	1
hey,	1
at	1
the	1
"Saracen's	1
Head"?	1
You	1
had	1
it	1
safe	1
last	1
night,	1
hey?--and	1
you	1
missed	1
it	1
this	1
morning?	1
Are	1
you	1
sure	1
you	1
had	1
it	1
safe	1
at	1
night?	1
Old	1
M.	1
Oh,	1
please	1
your	1
worship,	1
quite	1
sure;	1
for	1
I	1
took	1
it	1
out	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
it	1
just	1
before	1
I	1
said	1
my	1
prayers.	1
Just.	1
You	1
did--did	1
ye	1
so?--hum!	1
Pray,	1
my	1
good	1
friend,	1
where	1
might	1
you	1
put	1
your	1
money	1
when	1
you	1
went	1
to	1
bed?	1
Old	1
M.	1
Please,	1
your	1
worship,	1
where	1
I	1
always	1
put	1
it--always--in	1
my	1
tobacco-box.	1
Just.	1
Your	1
tobacco-box!	1
I	1
never	1
heard	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
thing--to	1
make	1
a	1
STRONG	1
BOX	1
of	1
a	1
tobacco-box.	1
Ha!	1
ha!	1
ha!	1
hum!--and	1
you	1
say	1
the	1
box	1
and	1
all	1
were	1
gone	1
in	1
the	1
morning?	1
Old	1
M.	1
No,	1
please	1
your	1
worship,	1
no;	1
not	1
the	1
box--the	1
box	1
was	1
never	1
stirred	1
from	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
I	1
put	1
it.	1
They	1
left	1
me	1
the	1
box.	1
Just.	1
Tut,	1
tut,	1
tut,	1
man!--took	1
the	1
money	1
and	1
left	1
the	1
box?	1
I'll	1
never	1
believe	1
THAT!	1
I'll	1
never	1
believe	1
that	1
anyone	1
could	1
be	1
such	1
a	1
fool.	1
Tut,	1
tut!	1
the	1
thing's	1
impossible!	1
It's	1
well	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
upon	1
oath.	1
Old	1
M.	1
If	1
I	1
were,	1
please	1
your	1
worship,	1
I	1
should	1
say	1
the	1
same;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
truth.	1
Just.	1
Don't	1
tell	1
me,	1
don't	1
tell	1
me;	1
I	1
say	1
the	1
thing	1
is	1
impossible.	1
Old	1
M.	1
Please,	1
your	1
worship,	1
here's	1
the	1
box.	1
Just.	1
(goes	1
on	1
without	1
looking	1
at	1
it).	1
Nonsense!	1
nonsense!	1
it's	1
no	1
such	1
thing;	1
it's	1
no	1
such	1
thing,	1
I	1
say--no	1
man	1
would	1
take	1
the	1
money	1
and	1
leave	1
the	1
tobacco-box.	1
I	1
won't	1
believe	1
it.	1
Nothing	1
shall	1
make	1
me	1
believe	1
it	1
ever--that's	1
poz.	1
Lucy	1
(takes	1
the	1
box,	1
and	1
holds	1
it	1
up	1
before	1
her	1
father's	1
eyes).	1
You	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
the	1
box,	1
did	1
you,	1
papa!	1
Just.	1
Yes,	1
yes,	1
yes,	1
child--nonsense!	1
it's	1
all	1
a	1
lie	1
from	1
beginning	1
to	1
end.	1
A	1
man	1
who	1
tells	1
one	1
lie	1
will	1
tell	1
a	1
hundred.	1
All	1
a	1
lie!	1
all	1
a	1
lie!	1
Old	1
M.	1
If	1
your	1
worship	1
would	1
give	1
me	1
leave--	1
Just.	1
Sir,	1
it	1
does	1
not	1
signify--it	1
does	1
not	1
signify!	1
I've	1
said	1
it,	1
I've	1
said	1
it,	1
and	1
that's	1
enough	1
to	1
convince	1
me,	1
and	1
I'll	1
tell	1
you	1
more;	1
if	1
my	1
Lord	1
Chief	1
Justice	1
of	1
England	1
told	1
it	1
to	1
me,	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
believe	1
it--	1
that's	1
poz!	1
Lucy	1
(still	1
playing	1
with	1
the	1
box).	1
But	1
how	1
comes	1
the	1
box	1
here,	1
I	1
wonder?	1
Just.	1
Pshaw!	1
pshaw!	1
pshaw!	1
darling.	1
Go	1
to	1
your	1
dolls,	1
darling,	1
and	1
don't	1
be	1
positive--go	1
to	1
your	1
dolls,	1
and	1
don't	1
talk	1
of	1
what	1
you	1
don't	1
understand.	1
What	1
can	1
you	1
understand,	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
know,	1
of	1
the	1
law?	1
Lucy.	1
No,	1
papa,	1
I	1
didn't	1
mean	1
about	1
the	1
law,	1
but	1
about	1
the	1
box;	1
because,	1
if	1
the	1
man	1
had	1
taken	1
it,	1
how	1
could	1
it	1
be	1
here,	1
you	1
know,	1
papa?	1
Just.	1
Hey,	1
hey,	1
what?	1
Why,	1
what	1
I	1
say	1
is	1
this,	1
that	1
I	1
don't	1
dispute	1
that	1
that	1
box,	1
that	1
you	1
hold	1
in	1
your	1
hands,	1
is	1
a	1
box;	1
nay,	1
for	1
aught	1
I	1
know,	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
a	1
tobacco-box--but	1
it's	1
clear	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
if	1
they	1
left	1
the	1
box	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
take	1
the	1
money;	1
and	1
how	1
do	1
you	1
dare,	1
sir,	1
to	1
come	1
before	1
Justice	1
Headstrong	1
with	1
a	1
lie	1
in	1
your	1
mouth;	1
recollect	1
yourself--I'll	1
give	1
you	1
time	1
to	1
recollect	1
yourself.	1
(A	1
pause.)	1
Just.	1
Well,	1
sir;,	1
and	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
say	1
now	1
about	1
the	1
box?	1
Old	1
M.	1
Please,	1
your	1
worship,	1
with	1
submission,	1
I	1
CAN	1
say	1
nothing	1
but	1
what	1
I	1
said	1
before.	1
Just.	1
What,	1
contradict	1
me	1
again,	1
after	1
I	1
gave	1
you	1
time	1
to	1
recollect	1
yourself!	1
I've	1
done	1
with	1
you;	1
I	1
have	1
done.	1
Contradict	1
me	1
as	1
often	1
as	1
you	1
please,	1
but	1
you	1
cannot	1
impose	1
upon	1
me;	1
I	1
defy	1
you	1
to	1
impose	1
upon	1
me!	1
Old	1
M.	1
Impose!	1
Just.	1
I	1
know	1
the	1
law!--I	1
know	1
the	1
law!--and	1
I'll	1
make	1
you	1
know	1
it,	1
too.	1
One	1
hour	1
I'll	1
give	1
you	1
to	1
recollect	1
yourself,	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
don't	1
give	1
up	1
this	1
idle	1
story,	1
I'll--I'll	1
commit	1
you	1
as	1
a	1
vagrant--that's	1
poz!	1
Go,	1
go,	1
for	1
the	1
present.	1
William,	1
take	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
servants'	1
hall,	1
do	1
you	1
hear?--What,	1
take	1
the	1
money	1
and	1
leave	1
the	1
box?	1
I'll	1
never	1
do	1
it--that's	1
poz!	1
(Lucy	1
speaks	1
to	1
the	1
Old	1
Man	1
as	1
he	1
is	1
going	1
off.)	1
Lucy.	1
Don't	1
be	1
frightened!	1
don't	1
be	1
frightened!--I	1
mean,	1
you	1
tell	1
the	1
truth,	1
never	1
be	1
frightened.	1
Old	1
M.	1
IF	1
I	1
tell	1
the	1
truth--(turning	1
up	1
his	1
eyes).	1
(Old	1
Man	1
is	1
still	1
held	1
back	1
by	1
the	1
young	1
lady.)	1
Lucy.	1
One	1
moment--answer	1
me	1
one	1
question--because	1
of	1
something	1
that	1
just	1
came	1
into	1
my	1
head.	1
Was	1
the	1
box	1
shut	1
fast	1
when	1
you	1
left	1
it?	1
Old	1
M.	1
No,	1
miss,	1
no!--open--it	1
was	1
open;	1
for	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
find	1
the	1
lid	1
in	1
the	1
dark--my	1
candle	1
went	1
out.	1
IF	1
I	1
tell	1
the	1
truth--oh!	1
(Exit.)	1
SCENE	1
IV.	1
Justice's	1
Study--the	1
Justice	1
is	1

Old	1
M.	1
Well!--I	1
shall	1
have	1
but	1
few	1
days'	1
more	1
misery	1
in	1
this	1
world!	1
Just.	1
(looks	1
up).	1
Why!	1
why--why	1
then,	1
why	1
will	1
you	1
be	1
so	1
positive	1
to	1
persist	1
in	1
a	1
lie?	1
Take	1
the	1
money	1
and	1
leave	1
the	1
box!	1
Obstinate	1
blockhead!	1
Here,	1
William	1
(showing	1
the	1
committal),	1
take	1
this	1
old	1
gentleman	1
to	1
Holdfast,	1
the	1
constable,	1
and	1
give	1
him	1
this	1
warrant.	1
Enter	1
Lucy,	1
running,	1
out	1
of	1
breath.	1
Lucy.	1
I've	1
found	1
it!	1
I've	1
found	1
it!	1
Here,	1
old	1
man;	1
here's	1
your	1
money--	1
here	1
it	1
is	1
all--a	1
guinea	1
and	1
a	1
half,	1
and	1
a	1
shilling	1
and	1
a	1
sixpence,	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
said,	1
papa.	1
Enter	1
LANDLADY.	1
Land.	1
Oh	1
la!	1
your	1
worship,	1
did	1
you	1
ever	1
hear	1
the	1
like?	1
Just.	1
I've	1
heard	1
nothing	1
yet	1
that	1
I	1
can	1
understand.	1
First,	1
have	1
you	1
secured	1
the	1
thief,	1
I	1
say?	1
Lucy	1
(makes	1
signs	1
to	1
the	1
landlady	1
to	1
be	1
silent).	1
Yes,	1
yes,	1
yes!--we	1
have	1
him	1
safe--we	1
have	1
him	1
prisoner.	1
Shall	1
he	1
come	1
in,	1
papa?	1
Just.	1
Yes,	1
child,	1
by	1
all	1
means;	1
and	1
now	1
I	1
shall	1
hear	1
what	1
possessed	1
him	1
to	1
leave	1
the	1
box.	1
I	1
don't	1
understand--there's	1
something	1
deep	1
in	1
all	1
this;	1
I	1
don't	1
understand	1
it.	1
Now	1
I	1
do	1
desire,	1
Mrs.	1
Landlady,	1
nobody	1
may	1
speak	1
a	1
single	1
word	1
whilst	1
I	1
am	1
cross-examining	1
the	1
thief.	1
(Landlady	1
puts	1
her	1
finger	1
upon	1
her	1
lips--Everybody	1
looks	1
eagerly	1
towards	1
the	1
door.)	1
Re-enter	1
Lucy,	1
with	1
a	1
huge	1
wicker	1
cage	1
in	1
her	1
hand,	1
containing	1
a	1
magpie--	1
The	1
Justice	1
drops	1
the	1
committal	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
hand.	1
Just.	1
Hey!--what,	1
Mrs.	1
Landlady--the	1
old	1
magpie?	1
hey?	1
Land.	1
Ay,	1
your	1
worship,	1
my	1
old	1
magpie.	1
Who'd	1
have	1
thought	1
it?	1
Miss	1
was	1
very	1
clever;	1
it	1
was	1
she	1
caught	1
the	1
thief.	1
Miss	1
was	1
very	1
clever.	1
Old	1
M.	1
Very	1
good!	1
very	1
good!	1
Just.	1
Ay,	1
darling,	1
her	1
father's	1
own	1
child!	1
How	1
was	1
it,	1
child?	1
Caught	1
the	1
thief,	1
WITH	1
THE	1
MAINOUR,	1
hey?	1
Tell	1
us	1
all;	1
I	1
will	1
hear	1
all--that's	1
poz!	1
Lucy.	1
Oh!	1
then	1
first	1
I	1
must	1
tell	1
you	1
how	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
suspect	1
Mr.	1
Magpie.	1
Do	1
you	1
remember,	1
papa,	1
that	1
day	1
last	1
summer,	1
when	1
I	1
went	1
with	1
you	1
to	1
the	1
bowling-green,	1
at	1
the	1
"Saracen's	1
Head"?	1
Land.	1
Oh,	1
of	1
all	1
days	1
in	1
the	1
year!	1
but	1
I	1
ask	1
pardon,	1
miss.	1
Lucy.	1
Well,	1
that	1
day	1
I	1
heard	1
my	1
uncle	1
and	1
another	1
gentleman	1
telling	1
stories	1
of	1
magpies	1
hiding	1
money;	1
and	1
they	1
laid	1
a	1
wager	1
about	1
this	1
old	1
magpie	1
and	1
they	1
tried	1
him--they	1
put	1
a	1
shilling	1
upon	1
the	1
table,	1
and	1
he	1
ran	1
away	1
with	1
it,	1
and	1
hid	1
it;	1
so	1
I	1
thought	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
do	1
so	1
again,	1
you	1
know,	1
this	1
time.	1
Just.	1
Right,	1
right.	1
It's	1
a	1
pity,	1
child,	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
upon	1
the	1
Bench;	1
ha!	1
ha!	1
ha!	1
Lucy.	1
And	1
when	1
I	1
went	1
to	1
his	1
old	1
hiding	1
place,	1
there	1
it	1
was;	1
but	1
you	1
see,	1
papa,	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
take	1
the	1
box.	1
Just.	1
No,	1
no,	1
no!	1
because	1
the	1
thief	1
was	1
a	1
magpie.	1
No	1
MAN	1
would	1
have	1
taken	1
the	1
money	1
and	1
left	1
the	1
box.	1
You	1
see	1
I	1
was	1
right;	1
no	1
MAN	1
would	1
have	1
left	1
the	1
box,	1
hey?	1
Lucy.	1
Certainly	1
not,	1
I	1
suppose;	1
but	1
I'm	1
so	1
very	1
glad,	1
old	1
man,	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
obtained	1
your	1
money.	1
Just.	1
Well	1
then,	1
child,	1
here--take	1
my	1
purse,	1
and	1
add	1
that	1
to	1
it.	1
We	1
were	1
a	1
little	1
too	1
hasty	1
with	1
the	1
committal--hey?	1
Land.	1
Ay,	1
and	1
I	1
fear	1
I	1
was,	1
too;	1
but	1
when	1
one	1
is	1
touched	1
about	1
the	1
credit	1
of	1
one's	1
house,	1
one's	1
apt	1
to	1
speak	1
warmly.	1
Old	1
M.	1
Oh,	1
I'm	1
the	1
happiest	1
old	1
man	1
alive!	1
You	1
are	1
all	1
convinced	1
that	1
I	1
told	1
you	1
no	1
lies.	1
Say	1
no	1
more--say	1
no	1
more.	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
happiest	1
man!	1
Miss,	1
you	1
have	1
made	1
me	1
the	1
happiest	1
man	1
alive!	1
Bless	1
you	1
for	1
it!	1
Land.	1
Well	1
now,	1
I'll	1
tell	1
you	1
what.	1
I	1
know	1
what	1
I	1
think--you	1
must	1
keep	1
that	1
there	1
magpie,	1
and	1
make	1
a	1
show	1
of	1
him,	1
and	1
I	1
warrant	1
he'll	1
bring	1
you	1
many	1
an	1
honest	1
penny;	1
for	1
it's	1
a	1
TRUE	1
STORY,	1
and	1
folks	1
would	1
like	1
to	1
hear	1
it,	1
I	1
hopes--	1
Just.	1
(eagerly).	1
And,	1
friend,	1
do	1
you	1
hear?	1
you'll	1
dine	1
here	1
today,	1
you'll	1
dine	1
here.	1
We	1
have	1
some	1
excellent	1
ale.	1
I	1
will	1
have	1
you	1
drink	1
my	1
health--that's	1
poz!--hey?	1
You'll	1
drink	1
my	1
health,	1
won't	1
you--hey?	1
Old	1
M.	1
(bows).	1
Oh!	1
and	1
the	1
young	1
lady's,	1
if	1
you	1
please.	1
Just.	1
Ay,	1
ay,	1
drink	1
her	1
health--she	1
deserves	1
it.	1
Ay,	1
drink	1
my	1
darling's	1
health.	1
Land.	1
And	1
please	1
your	1
worship,	1
it's	1
the	1
right	1
time,	1
I	1
believe,	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
the	1
goose-pie	1
now;	1
and	1
a	1
charming	1
pie	1
it	1
is,	1
and	1
it's	1
on	1
the	1
table.	1
Will.	1
And	1
Mr.	1
Smack,	1
the	1
curate,	1
and	1
Squire	1
Solid,	1
and	1
the	1
doctor,	1
sir,	1
are	1
come,	1
and	1
dinner	1
is	1
upon	1
the	1
table.	1
Just.	1
Then	1
let	1
us	1
say	1
no	1
more;	1
but	1
do	1
justice	1
immediately	1
to	1
the	1
goose-	1
pie;	1
and,	1
darling,	1
put	1
me	1
in	1
mind	1
to	1
tell	1
this	1
story	1
after	1
dinner.	1
(After	1
they	1
go	1
out,	1
the	1
Justice	1
stops.)	1
"Tell	1
this	1
story"--I	1
don't	1
know	1
whether	1
it	1
tells	1
well	1
for	1
me;	1
but	1
I'll	1
never	1
be	1
positive	1
any	1
more--THAT'S	1
POZ!	1
THE	1
MIMIC.	1
CHAPTER	1
I.	1
Mr.	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Montague	1
spent	1
the	1
summer	1
of	1
the	1
year	1
1795	1
at	1
Clifton	1
with	1
their	1
son	1
Frederick,	1
and	1
their	1
two	1
daughters	1
Sophia	1
and	1
Marianne.	1
They	1
had	1
taken	1
much	1
care	1
of	1
the	1
education	1
of	1
their	1
children;	1
nor	1
were	1
they	1
ever	1
tempted,	1
by	1
any	1
motive	1
of	1
personal	1
convenience	1
or	1
temporary	1
amusement,	1
to	1
hazard	1
the	1
permanent	1
happiness	1
of	1
their	1
pupils.	1
Sensible	1
of	1
the	1
extreme	1
importance	1
of	1
early	1
impressions,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
powerful	1
influence	1
of	1
external	1
circumstances	1
in	1
forming	1
the	1
characters	1
and	1
the	1
manners,	1
they	1
were	1
now	1
anxious	1
that	1
the	1
variety	1
of	1
new	1
ideas	1
and	1
new	1
objects	1
which	1
would	1
strike	1
the	1
minds	1
of	1
their	1
children	1
should	1
appear	1
in	1
a	1
just	1
point	1
of	1
view.	1
"Let	1
children	1
see	1
and	1
judge	1
for	1
themselves,"	1
is	1
often	1
inconsiderately	1
said.	1
Where	1
children	1
see	1
only	1
a	1
part	1
they	1
cannot	1
judge	1
of	1
the	1
whole;	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
superficial	1
view	1
which	1
they	1
can	1
have	1
in	1
short	1
visits	1
and	1
desultory	1
conversation,	1
they	1
can	1
form	1
only	1
a	1
false	1
estimate	1
of	1
the	1
objects	1
of	1
human	1
happiness,	1
a	1
false	1
notion	1
of	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
society,	1
and	1
false	1
opinions	1
of	1
characters.	1
For	1
the	1
above	1
reasons,	1
Mr.	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Montague	1
were	1
particularly	1
cautious	1
in	1
the	1
choice	1
of	1
their	1
acquaintances,	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
well	1
aware	1
that	1
whatever	1
passed	1
in	1
conversation	1
before	1
children	1
became	1
part	1
of	1
their	1
education.	1
When	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
Clifton	1
they	1
wished	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
house	1
entirely	1
to	1
themselves,	1
but,	1
as	1
they	1
came	1
late	1
in	1
the	1
season,	1
almost	1
all	1
the	1
lodging	1
houses	1
were	1
full,	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
weeks	1
they	1
were	1
obliged	1
to	1
remain	1
in	1
a	1
house	1
where	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
apartments	1
were	1
already	1
occupied.	1
During	1
the	1
first	1
fortnight	1
they	1
scarcely	1
saw	1
or	1
heard	1
anything	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
families	1
who	1
lodged	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
floor	1
with	1
them.	1
An	1
elderly	1
quaker,	1
and	1
his	1
sister	1
Bertha,	1
were	1
their	1
silent	1
neighbours.	1
The	1
blooming	1
complexion	1
of	1
the	1
lady	1
had	1
indeed	1
attracted	1
the	1
attention	1
of	1
the	1
children,	1
as	1
they	1
caught	1
a	1
glimpse	1
of	1
her	1
face	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
getting	1
into	1
her	1
carriage	1
to	1
go	1
out	1
upon	1
the	1
Downs.	1
They	1
could	1
scarcely	1
believe	1
that	1
she	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
Wells	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
her	1
health.	1
Besides	1
her	1
blooming	1
complexion,	1
the	1
delicate	1
white	1
of	1
her	1
garments	1
had	1
struck	1
them	1
with	1
admiration;	1
and	1
they	1
observed	1
that	1
her	1
brother	1
carefully	1
guarded	1
her	1
dress	1
from	1
the	1
wheel	1
of	1
the	1
carriage,	1
as	1
he	1
handed	1
her	1
in.	1
From	1
this	1
circumstance,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
benevolent	1
countenance	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
gentleman,	1
they	1
concluded	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
fond	1
of	1
his	1
sister,	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
certainly	1
very	1
happy,	1
except	1
that	1
they	1
never	1
spoke,	1
and	1
could	1
be	1
seen	1
only	1
for	1
a	1
moment.	1
Not	1
so	1
the	1
maiden	1
lady	1
who	1
occupied	1
the	1
ground	1
floor.	1
On	1
the	1
stairs,	1
in	1
the	1
passages,	1
at	1
her	1
window,	1
she	1
was	1
continually	1
visible;	1
and	1
she	1
appeared	1
to	1
possess	1
the	1
art	1
of	1
being	1
present	1
in	1
all	1
these	1
places	1
at	1
once.	1
Her	1
voice	1
was	1
eternally	1
to	1
be	1
heard,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
particularly	1
melodious.	1
The	1
very	1
first	1
day	1
she	1
met	1
Mrs.	1
Montague's	1
children	1
on	1
the	1
stairs,	1
she	1
stopped	1
to	1
tell	1
Marianne	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
charming	1
dear,	1
and	1
a	1
charming	1
little	1
dear;	1
to	1
kiss	1
her,	1
to	1
inquire	1
her	1
name,	1
and	1
to	1
inform	1
her	1
that	1
her	1
own	1
name	1
was	1
"Mrs.	1
Theresa	1
Tattle,"	1
a	1
circumstance	1
of	1
which	1
there	1
was	1
little	1
danger	1
of	1
their	1
long	1
remaining	1
in	1
ignorance;	1
for,	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
one	1
morning,	1
at	1
least	1
twenty	1
single	1
and	1
as	1
many	1
double	1
raps	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
were	1
succeeded	1
by	1
vociferations	1
of	1
"Mrs.	1
Theresa	1
Tattle's	1
servant!"	1
"Mrs.	1
Theresa	1
Tattle	1
at	1
home?"	1
"Mrs.	1
Theresa	1
Tattle	1
not	1
at	1
home!"	1
No	1
person	1
at	1
the	1
Wells	1
was	1
oftener	1
at	1
home	1
and	1
abroad	1
than	1
Mrs.	1
Tattle.	1
She	1
had,	1
as	1
she	1
deemed	1
it,	1
the	1
happiness	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
most	1
extensive	1
acquaintance	1
residing	1
at	1
Clifton.	1
She	1
had	1
for	1
years	1
kept	1
a	1
register	1
of	1
arrivals.	1
She	1
regularly	1
consulted	1
the	1
subscriptions	1
to	1
the	1
circulating	1
libraries,	1
and	1
the	1
lists	1
at	1
the	1
Ball	1
and	1
the	1
Pump-rooms:	1
so	1
that,	1
with	1
a	1
memory	1
unencumbered	1
with	1
literature,	1
and	1
free	1
from	1
all	1
domestic	1
cares,	1
she	1
contrived	1
to	1
retain	1
a	1
most	1
astonishing	1
and	1
correct	1
list	1
of	1
births,	1
deaths	1
and	1
marriages,	1
together	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
anecdotes,	1
amusing,	1
instructive,	1
or	1
scandalous,	1
which	1
are	1
necessary	1
to	1
the	1
conversation	1
of	1
a	1
water	1
drinking	1
place,	1
and	1
essential	1
to	1
the	1
character	1
of	1
a	1
"very	1
pleasant	1
woman."	1
"A	1
very	1
pleasant	1
woman,"	1
Mrs.	1
Tattle	1
was	1
usually	1
called;	1
and,	1
conscious	1
of	1
her	1
accomplishments,	1
she	1
was	1
eager	1
to	1
introduce	1
herself	1
to	1
the	1
acquaintance	1
of	1
her	1
new	1
neighbours;	1
having,	1
with	1
her	1
ordinary	1
expedition,	1
collected	1
from	1
their	1
servants,	1
by	1
means	1
of	1
her	1
own,	1
all	1
that	1
could	1
be	1
known,	1
or	1
rather,	1
all	1
that	1
could	1
be	1
told	1
about	1
them.	1
The	1
name	1
of	1
Montague,	1
at	1
all	1
events,	1
she	1
knew	1
was	1
a	1
good	1
name,	1
and	1
justified	1
in	1
courting	1
the	1
acquaintance.	1
She	1
courted	1
it	1
first	1
by	1
nods,	1
and	1
becks	1
and	1
smiles	1
at	1
Marianne	1
whenever	1
she	1
met	1
her;	1
and	1
Marianne,	1
who	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
little	1
girl,	1
began	1
presently	1
to	1
nod	1
and	1
smile	1
in	1
return,	1
persuaded	1
that	1
a	1
lady	1
who	1
smiled	1
so	1
much,	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
ill-natured.	1
Besides,	1
Mrs.	1
Theresa's	1
parlour	1
door	1
was	1
sometimes	1
left	1
more	1
than	1
half	1
open,	1
to	1
afford	1
a	1
view	1
of	1
a	1
green	1
parrot.	1
Marianne	1
sometimes	1
passed	1
very	1
slowly	1
by	1
this	1
door.	1
One	1
morning	1
it	1
was	1
left	1
quite	1
wide	1
open,	1
when	1
she	1
stopped	1
to	1
say	1
"Pretty	1
Poll";	1
and	1
immediately	1
Mrs.	1
Tattle	1
begged	1
she	1
would	1
do	1
her	1
the	1
honour	1
to	1
walk	1
in	1
and	1
see	1
"Pretty	1
Poll,"	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
taking	1
the	1
liberty	1
to	1
offer	1
her	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
iced	1
plum-cake.	1
The	1
next	1
day	1
Mrs.	1
Theresa	1
Tattle	1
did	1
herself	1
the	1
honour	1
to	1
wait	1
upon	1
Mrs.	1
Montague,	1
"to	1
apologize	1
for	1
the	1
liberty	1
she	1
taken	1
in	1
inviting	1
Mrs.	1
Montague's	1
charming	1
Miss	1
Marianne	1
into	1
her	1
apartment	1
to	1
see	1
Pretty	1
Poll,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
still	1
greater	1
liberty	1
she	1
had	1
taken	1
in	1
offering	1
her	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
plum-cake--inconsiderate	1
creature	1
that	1
she	1
was!--which	1
might	1
possibly	1
have	1
disagreed	1
with	1
her,	1
and	1
which	1
certainly	1
were	1
liberties	1
she	1
never	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
induced	1
to	1
take,	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
unaccountably	1
bewitched	1
by	1
Miss	1
Marianne's	1
striking	1
though	1
highly	1
flattering	1
resemblance	1
to	1
a	1
young	1
gentleman	1
(an	1
officer)	1
with	1
whom	1
she	1
had	1
danced,	1
now	1
nearly	1
twelve	1
years	1
ago,	1
of	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Montague,	1
a	1
most	1
respectable	1
young	1
man,	1
and	1
of	1
a	1
most	1
respectable	1
family,	1
with	1
which,	1
in	1
a	1
remote	1
degree,	1
she	1
might	1
presume	1
to	1
say,	1
she	1
herself	1
was	1
someway	1
connected,	1
having	1
the	1
honour	1
to	1
be	1
nearly	1
related	1
to	1
the	1
Joneses	1
of	1
Merionethshire,	1
who	1
were	1
cousins	1
to	1
the	1
Mainwarings	1
of	1
Bedfordshire,	1
who	1
married	1
into	1
the	1
family	1
of	1
the	1
Griffiths,	1
the	1
eldest	1
branch	1
of	1
which,	1
she	1
understood,	1
had	1
the	1
honour	1
to	1
be	1
cousin-german	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Montague;	1
on	1
which	1
account	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
impatient	1
to	1
pay	1
a	1
visit,	1
so	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
productive	1
of	1
most	1
agreeable	1
consequences,	1
by	1
the	1
acquisition	1
of	1
an	1
acquaintance	1
whose	1
society	1
must	1
do	1
her	1
infinite	1
honour."	1
Having	1
thus	1
happily	1
accomplished	1
her	1
first	1
visit,	1
there	1
seemed	1
little	1
probability	1
of	1
escaping	1
Mrs.	1
Tattle's	1
further	1
acquaintance.	1
In	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
week	1
she	1
only	1
hinted	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Montague	1
that	1
"some	1
people	1
thought	1
his	1
system	1
of	1
education	1
rather	1
odd;	1
that	1
she	1
should	1
be	1
obliged	1
to	1
him	1
if	1
he	1
would,	1
some	1
time	1
or	1
other,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
nothing	1
else	1
to	1
do,	1
just	1
sit	1
down	1
and	1
make	1
her	1
understand	1
his	1
notions,	1
that	1
she	1
might	1
have	1
something	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
her	1
acquaintance,	1
as	1
she	1
always	1
wished	1
to	1
have	1
when	1
she	1
heard	1
any	1
friend	1
attacked,	1
or	1
any	1
friend's	1
opinions."	1
Mr.	1
Montague	1
declining	1
to	1
sit	1
down	1
and	1
make	1
this	1
lady	1
understand	1
a	1
system	1
of	1
education	1
only	1
to	1
give	1
her	1
something	1
to	1
say,	1
and	1
showing	1
unaccountable	1
indifference	1
about	1
the	1
attacks	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
threatened,	1
Mrs.	1
Tattle	1
next	1
addressed	1
herself	1
to	1
Mrs.	1
Montague,	1
prophesying,	1
in	1
a	1
most	1
serious	1
whisper,	1
"that	1
the	1
charming	1
Miss	1
Marianne	1
would	1
shortly	1
and	1
inevitably	1
grow	1
quite	1
crooked,	1
if	1
she	1
were	1
not	1
immediately	1
provided	1
with	1
a	1
back-	1
board,	1
a	1
French	1
dancing-master,	1
and	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
stocks."	1
This	1
alarming	1
whisper	1
could	1
not,	1
however,	1
have	1
a	1
permanent	1
effect	1
upon	1
Mrs.	1
Montague's	1
understanding,	1
because	1
three	1
days	1
afterwards	1
Mrs.	1
Theresa,	1
upon	1
the	1
most	1
anxious	1
inspection,	1
entirely	1
mistook	1
the	1
just	1
and	1
natural	1
proportions	1
of	1
the	1
hip	1
and	1
shoulder.	1
This	1
danger	1
vanishing,	1
Mrs.	1
Tattle	1
presently,	1
with	1
a	1
rueful	1
length	1
of	1
face,	1
and	1
formal	1
preface,	1
"hesitated	1
to	1
assure	1
Mrs.	1
Montague,	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
greatly	1
distressed	1
about	1
her	1
daughter	1
Sophy;	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
convinced	1
her	1
lungs	1
were	1
affected;	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
certainly	1
ought	1
to	1
drink	1
the	1
waters	1
morning	1
and	1
evening;	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
things,	1
must	1
keep	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
patirosa	1
lozenges	1
constantly	1
in	1
her	1
mouth,	1
and	1
directly	1
consult	1
Dr.	1
Cardamum,	1
the	1
best	1
physician	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
the	1
person	1
she	1
would	1
send	1
for	1
herself	1
upon	1
her	1
death-bed;	1
because,	1
to	1
her	1
certain	1
knowledge,	1
he	1
had	1
recovered	1
a	1
young	1
lady,	1
a	1
relation	1
of	1
her	1
own,	1
after	1
she	1
had	1
lost	1
one	1
whole	1
GLOBE*	1
of	1
her	1
lungs."	1
*Lobe.	1
The	1
medical	1
opinion	1
of	1
a	1
lady	1
of	1
so	1
much	1
anatomical	1
precision	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
much	1
weight.	1
Neither	1
was	1
this	1
universal	1
adviser	1
more	1
successful	1
in	1
an	1
attempt	1
to	1
introduce	1
a	1
tutor	1
to	1
Frederick,	1
who,	1
she	1
apprehended,	1
must	1
want	1
some	1
one	1
to	1
perfect	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
Latin	1
and	1
Greek,	1
and	1
dead	1
languages,	1
of	1
which,	1
she	1
observed,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
impertinent	1
for	1
a	1
woman	1
to	1
talk;	1
only	1
she	1
might	1
venture	1
to	1
repeat	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
heard	1
said	1
by	1
good	1
authority,	1
that	1
a	1
competency	1
of	1
the	1
dead	1
tongues	1
could	1
be	1
had	1
nowhere	1
but	1
at	1
a	1
public	1
school,	1
or	1
else	1
from	1
a	1
private	1
tutor	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
abroad	1
(after	1
the	1
advantage	1
of	1
a	1
classical	1
education,	1
finished	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
universities)	1
with	1
a	1
good	1
family;	1
without	1
which	1
introduction	1
it	1
was	1
idle	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
reaping	1
solid	1
advantages	1
from	1
any	1
continental	1
tour;	1
all	1
which	1
requisites,	1
from	1
personal	1
knowledge,	1
she	1
could	1
aver	1
to	1
be	1
concentrated	1
in	1
the	1
gentleman	1
she	1
had	1
the	1
honour	1
to	1
recommend,	1
as	1
having	1
been	1
tutor	1
to	1
a	1
young	1
nobleman,	1
who	1
had	1
now	1
no	1
further	1
occasion	1
for	1
him,	1
having,	1
unfortunately	1
for	1
himself	1
and	1
his	1
family,	1
been	1
killed	1
in	1
an	1
untimely	1
duel.	1
All	1
Mrs.	1
Theresa	1
Tattle's	1
suggestions	1
being	1
lost	1
upon	1
these	1
stoical	1
parents,	1
her	1
powers	1
were	1
next	1
tried	1
upon	1
the	1
children,	1
and	1
her	1
success	1
soon	1
became	1
apparent.	1
On	1
Sophy,	1
indeed,	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
make	1
any	1
impression,	1
though	1
she	1
had	1
expended	1
on	1
her	1
some	1
of	1
her	1
finest	1
strokes	1
of	1
flattery.	1
Sophy,	1
though	1
very	1
desirous	1
of	1
the	1
approbation	1
of	1
her	1
friends,	1
was	1
not	1
very	1
desirous	1
of	1
winning	1
the	1
favour	1
of	1
strangers.	1
She	1
was	1
about	1
thirteen--that	1
dangerous	1
age	1
at	1
which	1
ill	1
educated	1
girls,	1
in	1
their	1
anxiety	1
to	1
display	1
their	1
accomplishments,	1
are	1
apt	1
to	1
become	1
dependent	1
for	1
applause	1
upon	1
the	1
praise	1
of	1
every	1
idle	1
visitor;	1
when	1
the	1
habits	1
not	1
being	1
formed,	1
and	1
the	1
attention	1
being	1
suddenly	1
turned	1
to	1
dress	1
and	1
manners,	1
girls	1
are	1
apt	1
to	1
affect	1
and	1
imitate,	1
indiscriminately,	1
everything	1
that	1
they	1
conceive	1
to	1
be	1
agreeable.	1
Sophy,	1
whose	1
taste	1
had	1
been	1
cultivated	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
with	1
her	1
powers	1
of	1
reasoning,	1
was	1
not	1
liable	1
to	1
fall	1
into	1
these	1
errors.	1
She	1
found	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
please	1
those	1
whom	1
she	1
wished	1
to	1
please,	1
without	1
affecting	1
to	1
be	1
anything	1
but	1
what	1
she	1
really	1
was;	1
and	1
her	1
friends	1
listened	1
to	1
what	1
she	1
said,	1
though	1
she	1
never	1
repeated	1
the	1
sentiments,	1
or	1
adopted	1
the	1
phrases,	1
which	1
she	1
might	1
easily	1
have	1
copied	1
from	1
the	1
conversation	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
older	1
or	1
more	1
fashionable	1
than	1
herself.	1
This	1
word	1
FASHIONABLE,	1
Mrs.	1
Theresa	1
Tattle	1
knew,	1
had	1
usually	1
a	1
great	1
effect,	1
even	1
at	1
thirteen;	1
but	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
observed	1
that	1
it	1
had	1
much	1
power	1
upon	1
Sophy;	1
nor	1
were	1
her	1
remarks	1
concerning	1
grace	1
and	1
manners	1
much	1
attended	1
to.	1
Her	1
mother	1
had	1
taught	1
Sophy	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
best	1
to	1
let	1
herself	1
alone,	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
distort	1
either	1
her	1
person	1
or	1
her	1
mind	1
in	1
acquiring	1
grimace,	1
which	1
nothing	1
but	1
the	1
fashion	1
of	1
the	1
moment	1
can	1
support,	1
and	1
which	1
is	1
always	1
detected	1
and	1
despised	1
by	1
people	1
of	1
real	1
good	1
sense	1
and	1
politeness.	1
"Bless	1
me!"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Tattle,	1
to	1
herself,	1
"if	1
I	1
had	1
such	1
a	1
tall	1
daughter,	1
and	1
so	1
unformed,	1
before	1
my	1
eyes	1
from	1
morning	1
to	1
night,	1
it	1
would	1
certainly	1
break	1
my	1
poor	1
heart.	1
Thank	1
heaven,	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
a	1
mother!	1
if	1
I	1
were,	1
Miss	1
Marianne	1
for	1
me!"	1
Miss	1
Marianne	1
had	1
heard	1
so	1
often	1
from	1
Mrs.	1
Tattle	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
very	1
charming,	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
believing	1
it;	1
and	1
from	1
being	1
a	1
very	1
pleasing,	1
unaffected	1
little	1
girl,	1
she	1
in	1
a	1
short	1
time	1
grew	1
so	1
conceited,	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
neither	1
speak,	1
look,	1
nor	1
be	1
silent	1
without	1
imagining	1
that	1
everybody	1
was,	1
or	1
ought	1
to	1
be,	1
looking	1
at	1
her;	1
and	1
when	1
Mrs.	1
Theresa	1
saw	1
that	1
Mrs.	1
Montague	1
looked	1
very	1
grave	1
upon	1
these	1
occasions,	1
she,	1
to	1
repair	1
the	1
ill	1
she	1
had	1
done,	1
would	1
say,	1
after	1
praising	1
Marianne's	1
hair	1
or	1
her	1
eyes,	1
"Oh,	1
but	1
little	1
ladies	1
should	1
never	1
think	1
about	1
their	1
beauty,	1
you	1
know.	1
Nobody	1
loves	1
anybody	1
for	1
being	1
handsome,	1
but	1
for	1
being	1
good."	1
People	1
must	1
think	1
children	1
are	1
very	1
silly,	1
or	1
else	1
they	1
can	1
never	1
have	1
reflected	1
upon	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
belief	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
minds,	1
if	1
they	1
imagine	1
that	1
children	1
will	1
believe	1
the	1
words	1
that	1
are	1
said	1
to	1
them,	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
moral,	1
when	1
the	1
countenance,	1
manner,	1
and	1
every	1
concomitant	1
circumstance	1
tell	1
them	1
a	1
different	1
tale.	1
Children	1
are	1
excellent	1
physiognomists--they	1
quickly	1
learn	1
the	1
universal	1
language	1
of	1
looks;	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
said	1
OF	1
them	1
always	1
makes	1
a	1
greater	1
impression	1
than	1
what	1
is	1
said	1
TO	1
them,	1
a	1
truth	1
of	1
which	1
those	1
prudent	1
people	1
surely	1
cannot	1
be	1
aware	1
who	1
comfort	1
themselves,	1
and	1
apologize	1
to	1
parents,	1
by	1
saying,	1
"Oh,	1
but	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
say	1
so	1
and	1
so	1
to	1
the	1
child."	1
Mrs.	1
Theresa	1
had	1
seldom	1
said	1
to	1
Frederick	1
Montague,	1
"that	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
vast	1
deal	1
of	1
drollery,	1
and	1
was	1
a	1
most	1
incomparable	1
mimic;"	1
but	1
she	1
had	1
said	1
so	1
of	1
him	1
in	1
whispers,	1
which	1
magnified	1
the	1
sound	1
to	1
his	1
imagination,	1
if	1
not	1
to	1
his	1
ear.	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
boy	1
of	1
much	1
vivacity,	1
and	1
had	1
considerable	1
abilities;	1
but	1
his	1
appetite	1
for	1
vulgar	1
praise	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
been	1
surfeited.	1
Even	1
Mrs.	1
Theresa	1
Tattle's	1
flattery	1
pleased	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
exerted	1
himself	1
for	1
her	1
entertainment	1
so	1
much	1
that	1
he	1
became	1
quite	1
a	1
buffoon.	1
Instead	1
of	1
observing	1
characters	1
and	1
manners,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
judge	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
form	1
his	1
own,	1
he	1
now	1
watched	1
every	1
person	1
he	1
saw,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
detect	1
some	1
foible,	1
or	1
catch	1
some	1
singularity	1
in	1
their	1
gesture	1
or	1
pronunciation,	1
which	1
he	1
might	1
successfully	1
mimic.	1
Alarmed	1
by	1
the	1
rapid	1
progress	1
of	1
these	1
evils,	1
Mr.	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Montague,	1
who,	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
honoured	1
with	1
Mrs.	1
Tattle's	1
visit,	1
had	1
begun	1
to	1
look	1
out	1
for	1
new	1
lodgings,	1
were	1
now	1
extremely	1
impatient	1
to	1
decamp.	1
They	1
were	1
not	1
people	1
who,	1
from	1
the	1
weak	1
fear	1
of	1
offending	1
a	1
silly	1
acquaintance,	1
would	1
hazard	1
the	1
happiness	1
of	1
their	1
family.	1
They	1
had	1
heard	1
of	1
a	1
house	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
which	1
was	1
likely	1
to	1
suit	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
determined	1
to	1
go	1
directly	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
it.	1
As	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
absent	1
all	1
day,	1
they	1
foresaw	1
that	1
their	1
officious	1
neighbour	1
would	1
probably	1
interfere	1
with	1
their	1
children.	1
They	1
did	1
not	1
choose	1
to	1
exact	1
any	1
promise	1
from	1
them	1
which	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
tempted	1
to	1
break,	1
and	1
therefore	1
they	1
only	1
said	1
at	1
parting,	1
"If	1
Mrs.	1
Theresa	1
Tattle	1
should	1
ask	1
you	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
her,	1
do	1
as	1
you	1
think	1
proper."	1
Scarcely	1
had	1
Mrs.	1
Montague's	1
carriage	1
got	1
out	1
of	1
hearing	1
when	1
a	1
note	1
was	1
brought,	1
directed	1
to	1
"Frederick	1
Montague,	1
Junior,	1
Esq.,"	1
which	1
he	1
immediately	1
opened,	1
and	1
read	1
as	1
follows:--	1
"Mrs.	1
Theresa	1
Tattle	1
presents	1
her	1
very	1
best	1
compliments	1
to	1
the	1
entertaining	1
Mr.	1
Frederick	1
Montague;	1
she	1
hopes	1
he	1
will	1
have	1
the	1
charity	1
to	1
drink	1
tea	1
with	1
her	1
this	1
evening,	1
and	1
bring	1
his	1
charming	1
sister,	1
Miss	1
Marianne,	1
with	1
him,	1
as	1
Mrs.	1
Theresa	1
will	1
be	1
quite	1
alone	1
with	1
a	1
shocking	1
headache,	1
and	1
is	1
sensible	1
her	1
nerves	1
are	1
affected;	1
and	1
Dr.	1
Cardamum	1
says	1
that	1
(especially	1
in	1
Mrs.	1
T.	1
T.'s	1
case)	1
it	1
is	1
downright	1
death	1
to	1
nervous	1
patients	1
to	1
be	1
alone	1
an	1
instant.	1
She	1
therefore	1
trusts	1
Mr.	1
Frederick	1
will	1
not	1
refuse	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
make	1
her	1
laugh.	1
Mrs.	1
Theresa	1
has	1
taken	1
care	1
to	1
provide	1
a	1
few	1
macaroons	1
for	1
her	1
little	1
favourite,	1
who	1
said	1
she	1
was	1
particularly	1
fond	1
of	1
them	1
the	1
other	1
day.	1
Mrs.	1
Theresa	1
hopes	1
they	1
will	1
all	1
come	1
at	1
six,	1
or	1
before,	1
not	1
forgetting	1
Miss	1
Sophy,	1
if	1
she	1
will	1
condescend	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
the	1
party."	1
At	1
the	1
first	1
reading	1
of	1
this	1
note,	1
"the	1
entertaining"	1
Mr.	1
Frederick,	1
and	1
the	1
"charming"	1
Miss	1
Marianne	1
laughed	1
heartily,	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
Sophy,	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
afraid	1
that	1
she	1
should	1
think	1
it	1
possible	1
they	1
could	1
like	1
such	1
gross	1
flattery;	1
but	1
upon	1
a	1
second	1
perusal,	1
Marianne	1
observed	1
that	1
it	1
certainly	1
was	1
very	1
good-natured	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
Theresa	1
to	1
remember	1
the	1
macaroons;	1
and	1
Frederick	1
allowed	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
wrong	1
to	1
laugh	1
at	1
the	1
poor	1
woman	1
because	1
she	1
had	1
the	1
headache.	1
Then	1
twisting	1
the	1
note	1
in	1
his	1
fingers,	1
he	1
appealed	1
to	1
Sophy:--	1
"Well,	1
Sophy,	1
leave	1
off	1
drawing	1
for	1
an	1
instant,"	1
said	1
Frederick,	1
"and	1
tell	1
us	1
what	1
answer	1
can	1
we	1
send?"	1
"Can!--we	1
can	1
send	1
what	1
answer	1
we	1
please."	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
know	1
that,"	1
said	1
Frederick.	1
"I	1
would	1
refuse	1
if	1
I	1
could;	1
but	1
we	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
do	1
anything	1
rude,	1
should	1
we?	1
So	1
I	1
think	1
we	1
might	1
as	1
well	1
go,	1
because	1
we	1
could	1
not	1
refuse,	1
if	1
we	1
would,	1
I	1
say."	1
"You	1
have	1
made	1
such	1
confusion,"	1
replied	1
Sophy,	1
"between	1
'couldn't'	1
and	1
'wouldn't'	1
and	1
'shouldn't,'	1
that	1
I	1
can't	1
understand	1
you;	1
surely	1
they	1
are	1
all	1
different	1
things."	1
"Different!	1
no,"	1
cried	1
Frederick--"could,	1
would,	1
should,	1
might,	1
and	1
ought,	1
are	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
in	1
the	1
Latin	1
grammar;	1
all	1
of	1
'em	1
signs	1
of	1
the	1
potential	1
mood,	1
you	1
know."	1
Sophy,	1
whose	1
powers	1
of	1
reasoning	1
were	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
confounded,	1
even	1
by	1
quotations	1
from	1
the	1
Latin	1
grammar,	1
looked	1
up	1
soberly	1
from	1
her	1
drawing,	1
and	1
answered	1
"that	1
very	1
likely	1
those	1
words	1
might	1
be	1
signs	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
in	1
the	1
Latin	1
grammar,	1
but	1
she	1
believed	1
that	1
they	1
meant	1
perfectly	1
different	1
things	1
in	1
real	1
life."	1
"That's	1
just	1
as	1
people	1
please,"	1
said	1
her	1
sophistical	1
brother.	1
"You	1
know	1
words	1
mean	1
nothing	1
in	1
themselves.	1
If	1
I	1
choose	1
to	1
call	1
my	1
hat	1
my	1
cadwallader,	1
you	1
would	1
understand	1
me	1
just	1
as	1
well,	1
after	1
I	1
had	1
once	1
explained	1
it	1
to	1
you,	1
that	1
by	1
cadwallader	1
I	1
meant	1
this	1
black	1
thing	1
that	1
I	1
put	1
upon	1
my	1
head;	1
cadwallader	1
and	1
hat	1
would	1
then	1
be	1
just	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
to	1
you."	1
"Then	1
why	1
have	1
two	1
words	1
for	1
the	1
same	1
thing?"	1
said	1
Sophy;	1
"and	1
what	1
has	1
this	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
'could'	1
and	1
'should'?	1
You	1
wanted	1
to	1
prove--"	1
"I	1
wanted	1
to	1
prove,"	1
interrupted	1
Frederick,	1
"that	1
it's	1
not	1
worth	1
while	1
to	1
dispute	1
for	1
two	1
hours	1
about	1
two	1
words.	1
Do	1
keep	1
to	1
the	1
point,	1
Sophy,	1
and	1
don't	1
dispute	1
with	1
me."	1
"I	1
was	1
not	1
disputing,	1
I	1
was	1
reasoning."	1
"Well,	1
reasoning	1
or	1
disputing.	1
Women	1
have	1
no	1
business	1
to	1
do	1
either;	1
for,	1
how	1
should	1
they	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
chop	1
logic	1
like	1
men?"	1
At	1
this	1
contemptuous	1
sarcasm	1
upon	1
her	1
sex,	1
Sophy's	1
colour	1
rose.	1
"There!"	1
cried	1
Frederick,	1
exulting,	1
"now	1
we	1
shall	1
see	1
a	1
philosopheress	1
in	1
a	1
passion;	1
I'd	1
give	1
sixpence,	1
half-price,	1
for	1
a	1
harlequin	1
entertainment,	1
to	1
see	1
Sophy	1
in	1
a	1
passion.	1
Now,	1
Marianne,	1
look	1
at	1
her	1
brush	1
dabbing	1
so	1
fast	1
in	1
the	1
water!"	1
Sophy,	1
who	1
could	1
not	1
easily	1
bear	1
to	1
be	1
laughed	1
at,	1
with	1
some	1
little	1
indignation,	1
said,	1
"Brother,	1
I	1
wish--"	1
"There!	1
there!"	1
cried	1
Frederick,	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
colour	1
which	1
rose	1
in	1
her	1
cheeks	1
almost	1
to	1
her	1
temples--"rising!	1
rising!	1
rising!	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
thermometer!	1
blood	1
heat!	1
blood!	1
fever	1
heat!	1
boiling	1
water	1
heat!	1
Marianne."	1
"Then,"	1
said	1
Sophy,	1
smiling,	1
"you	1
should	1
stand	1
a	1
little	1
farther	1
off,	1
both	1
of	1
you.	1
Leave	1
the	1
thermometer	1
to	1
itself	1
a	1
little	1
while.	1
Give	1
it	1
time	1
to	1
cool.	1
It	1
will	1
come	1
down	1
to	1
'temperate'	1
by	1
the	1
time	1
you	1
look	1
again."	1
"Oh,	1
brother!"	1
cried	1
Marianne,	1
"she's	1
so	1
good-humoured,	1
don't	1
tease	1
her	1
any	1
more,	1
and	1
don't	1
draw	1
heads	1
upon	1
her	1
paper,	1
and	1
don't	1
stretch	1
her	1
india-rubber,	1
and	1
don't	1
let	1
us	1
dirty	1
any	1
more	1
of	1
her	1
brushes.	1
See!	1
the	1
sides	1
of	1
her	1
tumbler	1
are	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
colours."	1
"Oh,	1
I	1
only	1
mixed	1
red,	1
blue,	1
green	1
and	1
yellow,	1
to	1
show	1
you,	1
Marianne,	1
that	1
all	1
colours	1
mixed	1
together	1
make	1
white.	1
But	1
she	1
is	1
temperate	1
now,	1
and	1
I	1
won't	1
plague	1
her;	1
she	1
shall	1
chop	1
logic,	1
if	1
she	1
likes	1
it,	1
though	1
she	1
is	1
a	1
woman."	1
"But	1
that's	1
not	1
fair,	1
brother,"	1
said	1
Marianne,	1
"to	1
say	1
'woman'	1
in	1
that	1
way.	1
I'm	1
sure	1
Sophy	1
found	1
out	1
how	1
to	1
tie	1
that	1
difficult	1
knot,	1
which	1
papa	1
showed	1
us	1
yesterday,	1
long	1
before	1
you	1
did,	1
though	1
you	1
are	1
a	1
man."	1
"Not	1
long,"	1
said	1
Frederick.	1
"Besides,	1
that	1
was	1
only	1
a	1
conjuring	1
trick."	1
"It	1
was	1
very	1
ingenious,	1
though,"	1
said	1
Marianne;	1
"and	1
papa	1
said	1
so.	1
Besides,	1
she	1
understood	1
the	1
'Rule	1
of	1
Three,'	1
which	1
was	1
no	1
conjuring	1
trick,	1
better	1
than	1
you	1
did,	1
though	1
she	1
is	1
a	1
woman;	1
and	1
she	1
can	1
reason,	1
too,	1
mamma	1
says."	1
"Very	1
well,	1
let	1
her	1
reason	1
away,"	1
said	1
the	1
provoking	1
wit.	1
"All	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
say	1
is,	1
that	1
she'll	1
never	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
pudding."	1
"Why	1
not,	1
pray,	1
brother?"	1
inquired	1
Sophy,	1
looking	1
up	1
again,	1
very	1
gravely.	1
"Why,	1
you	1
know	1
papa	1
himself,	1
the	1
other	1
day	1
at	1
dinner,	1
said	1
that	1
the	1
woman	1
who	1
talks	1
Greek	1
and	1
Latin	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
I	1
do,	1
is	1
a	1
fool	1
after	1
all;	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
better	1
have	1
learned	1
something	1
useful;	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Tattle	1
said,	1
she'd	1
answer	1
for	1
it	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
pudding."	1
"Well!	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
talking	1
Greek	1
and	1
Latin,	1
am	1
I?"	1
"No,	1
but	1
you	1
are	1
drawing,	1
and	1
that's	1
the	1
same	1
thing."	1
"The	1
same	1
thing!	1
Oh,	1
Frederick!"	1
said	1
little	1
Marianne,	1
laughing.	1
"You	1
may	1
laugh;	1
but	1
I	1
say	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
same	1
sort	1
of	1
thing.	1
Women	1
who	1
are	1
always	1
drawing	1
and	1
reasoning,	1
never	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
make	1
puddings.	1
Mrs.	1
Theresa	1
Tattle	1
said	1
so,	1
when	1
I	1
showed	1
her	1
Sophy's	1
beautiful	1
drawing	1
yesterday."	1
"Mrs.	1
Theresa	1
Tattle	1
might	1
say	1
so,"	1
replied	1
Sophy,	1
calmly;	1
"but	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
perceive	1
the	1
reason,	1
brother,	1
why	1
drawing	1
should	1
prevent	1
me	1
from	1
learning	1
how	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
pudding."	1
"Well,	1
I	1
say	1
you'll	1
never	1
learn	1
how	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
good	1
pudding."	1
"I	1
have	1
learned,"	1
continued	1
Sophy,	1
who	1
was	1
mixing	1
her	1
colours,	1
"to	1
mix	1
such	1
and	1
such	1
colours	1
together	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
colour	1
that	1
I	1
want;	1
and	1
why	1
should	1
I	1
not	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
learn	1
to	1
mix	1
flour	1
and	1
butter,	1
and	1
sugar	1
and	1
egg,	1
together,	1
to	1
produce	1
the	1
taste	1
that	1
I	1
want."	1
"Oh,	1
but	1
mixing	1
will	1
never	1
do,	1
unless	1
you	1
know	1
the	1
quantities,	1
like	1
a	1
cook;	1
and	1
you	1
would	1
never	1
learn	1
the	1
right	1
quantities."	1
"How	1
did	1
the	1
cook	1
learn	1
them?	1
Cannot	1
I	1
learn	1
them	1
as	1
she	1
did?"	1
"Yes,	1
but	1
you'd	1
never	1
do	1
it	1
exactly,	1
and	1
mind	1
the	1
spoonfuls	1
right,	1
by	1
the	1
recipe,	1
like	1
a	1
cook."	1
"Indeed!	1
indeed!	1
but	1
she	1
would,"	1
cried	1
Marianne,	1
eagerly:	1
"and	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
more	1
exactly,	1
for	1
mamma	1
has	1
taught	1
her	1
to	1
weigh	1
and	1
measure	1
things	1
very	1
carefully:	1
and	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
ill	1
she	1
always	1
weighed	1
the	1
bark	1
in	1
nicely,	1
and	1
dropped	1
my	1
drops	1
so	1
carefully:	1
better	1
than	1
the	1
cook.	1
When	1
mamma	1
took	1
me	1
down	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
cook	1
make	1
a	1
cake	1
once,	1
I	1
saw	1
her	1
spoonfuls,	1
and	1
her	1
ounces,	1
and	1
her	1
handfuls:	1
she	1
dashed	1
and	1
splashed	1
without	1
minding	1
exactness	1
or	1
the	1
recipe,	1
or	1
anything.	1
I'm	1
sure	1
Sophy	1
would	1
make	1
a	1
much	1
better	1
pudding,	1
if	1
exactness	1
only	1
were	1
wanting."	1
"Well,	1
granting	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
make	1
the	1
best	1
pudding	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
world,	1
what	1
does	1
that	1
signify?	1
I	1
say	1
she	1
never	1
would:	1
so	1
it	1
comes	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
thing."	1
"Never	1
would!	1
how	1
can	1
you	1
tell	1
that,	1
brother?"	1
"Why,	1
now	1
look	1
at	1
her,	1
with	1
her	1
books,	1
and	1
her	1
drawings,	1
and	1
all	1
this	1
apparatus.	1
Do	1
you	1
think	1
she	1
would	1
ever	1
jump	1
up,	1
with	1
all	1
her	1
nicety,	1
too,	1
and	1
put	1
by	1
all	1
these	1
things,	1
to	1
go	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
greasy	1
kitchen,	1
and	1
plump	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
elbows	1
in	1
suet,	1
like	1
a	1
cook,	1
for	1
a	1
plum-pudding?"	1
"I	1
need	1
not	1
plump	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
elbows,	1
brother,"	1
said	1
Sophy,	1
smiling:	1
"nor	1
is	1
it	1
necessary	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
a	1
cook:	1
but,	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
necessary,	1
I	1
hope	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
pudding."	1
"Yes,	1
yes,"	1
cried	1
Marianne,	1
warmly;	1
"and	1
she	1
would	1
jump	1
up,	1
and	1
put	1
by	1
all	1
her	1
things	1
in	1
a	1
minute	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
necessary,	1
and	1
run	1
down	1
stairs	1
and	1
up	1
again	1
like	1
lightning,	1
or	1
do	1
anything	1
that	1
was	1
ever	1
so	1
disagreeable	1
to	1
her,	1
even	1
about	1
the	1
suet,	1
with	1
all	1
her	1
nicety,	1
brother,	1
I	1
assure	1
you,	1
as	1
she	1
used	1
to	1
do	1
anything,	1
everything	1
for	1
me,	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
ill	1
last	1
winter.	1
Oh,	1
brother,	1
she	1
can	1
do	1
anything;	1
and	1
she	1
could	1
make	1
the	1
best	1
plum-	1
pudding	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
world,	1
I'm	1
sure,	1
in	1
a	1
minute,	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
necessary."	1
CHAPTER	1
II.	1
A	1
knock	1
at	1
the	1
door,	1
from	1
Mrs.	1
Theresa	1
Tattle's	1
servant,	1
recalled	1
Marianne	1
to	1
the	1
business	1
of	1
the	1
day.	1
"There,"	1
said	1
Frederick,	1
"we	1
have	1
sent	1
no	1
answer	1
all	1
this	1
time.	1
It's	1
necessary	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
that	1
in	1
a	1
minute."	1
The	1
servant	1
came	1
with	1
his	1
mistress'	1
compliments,	1
to	1
let	1
the	1
young	1
ladies	1
and	1
Mr.	1
Frederick	1
know	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
waiting	1
tea	1
for	1
them.	1
"Waiting!	1
then	1
we	1
must	1
go,"	1
said	1
Frederick.	1
The	1
servant	1
opened	1
the	1
door	1
wider,	1
to	1
let	1
him	1
pass,	1
and	1
Marianne	1
thought	1
she	1
must	1
follow	1
her	1
brother:	1
so	1
they	1
went	1
downstairs	1
together,	1
while	1
Sophy	1
gave	1
her	1
own	1
message	1
to	1
the	1
servant,	1
and	1
quietly	1
stayed	1
at	1
her	1
usual	1
occupations.	1
Mrs.	1
Tattle	1
was	1
seated	1
at	1
her	1
tea-table,	1
with	1
a	1
large	1
plate	1
of	1
macaroons	1
beside	1
her	1
when	1
Frederick	1
and	1
Marianne	1
entered.	1
She	1
was	1
"delighted"	1
they	1
were	1
come,	1
and	1
"grieved"	1
not	1
to	1
see	1
Miss	1
Sophy	1
along	1
with	1
them.	1
Marianne	1
coloured	1
a	1
little;	1
for	1
though	1
she	1
had	1
precipitately	1
followed	1
her	1
brother,	1
and	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
quieted	1
her	1
conscience	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
by	1
saying	1
"You	1
know	1
papa	1
and	1
mamma	1
told	1
us	1
to	1
do	1
what	1
we	1
thought	1
best,"	1
yet	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
feel	1
quite	1
pleased	1
with	1
herself:	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
till	1
after	1
Mrs.	1
Theresa	1
had	1
exhausted	1
all	1
her	1
compliments,	1
and	1
half	1
her	1
macaroons,	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
restore	1
her	1
spirits	1
to	1
their	1
usual	1
height.	1
"Come,	1
Mr.	1
Frederick,"	1
said	1
she	1
after	1
tea,	1
"you	1
promised	1
to	1
make	1
me	1
laugh;	1
and	1
nobody	1
can	1
make	1
me	1
laugh	1
so	1
well	1
as	1
yourself."	1
"Oh,	1
brother,"	1
said	1
Marianne,	1
"show	1
Mrs.	1
Theresa	1
Dr.	1
Carbuncle	1
eating	1
his	1
dinner;	1
and	1
I'll	1
be	1
Mrs.	1
Carbuncle."	1
Marianne.	1
Now,	1
my	1
dear,	1
what	1
shall	1
I	1
help	1
you	1
to?	1
Frederick.	1
"My	1
dear!"	1
she	1
never	1
calls	1
him	1
my	1
dear,	1
you	1
know,	1
but	1
always	1
Doctor.	1
Mar.	1
Well	1
then,	1
doctor,	1
what	1
will	1
you	1
eat	1
to-day?	1
Fred.	1
Eat,	1
madam!	1
eat!	1
nothing!	1
nothing!	1
I	1
don't	1
see	1
anything	1
here	1
I	1
can	1
eat,	1
ma'am.	1
Mar.	1
Here's	1
eels,	1
sir;	1
let	1
me	1
help	1
you	1
to	1
some	1
eel--stewed	1
eel;--you	1
used	1
to	1
be	1
fond	1
of	1
stewed	1
eel.	1
Fred.	1
Used,	1
ma'am,	1
used!	1
But	1
I'm	1
sick	1
of	1
stewed	1
eels.	1
You	1
would	1
tire	1
one	1
of	1
anything.	1
Am	1
I	1
to	1
see	1
nothing	1
but	1
eels?	1
And	1
what's	1
this	1
at	1
the	1
bottom?	1
Mar.	1
Mutton,	1
doctor,	1
roast	1
mutton;	1
if	1
you'll	1
be	1
so	1
good	1
as	1
to	1
cut	1
it.	1
Fred.	1
Cut	1
it,	1
ma'am!	1
I	1
can't	1
cut	1
it,	1
I	1
say;	1
it's	1
as	1
hard	1
as	1
a	1
deal	1
board.	1
You	1
might	1
as	1
well	1
tell	1
me	1
to	1
cut	1
the	1
table,	1
ma'am.	1
Mutton,	1
indeed!	1
not	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
fat.	1
Roast	1
mutton,	1
indeed!	1
not	1
a	1
drop	1
of	1
gravy.	1
Mutton,	1
truly!	1
quite	1
a	1
cinder.	1
I'll	1
have	1
none	1
of	1
it.	1
Here,	1
take	1
it	1
away;	1
take	1
it	1
downstairs	1
to	1
the	1
cook.	1
It's	1
a	1
very	1
hard	1
case,	1
Mrs.	1
Carbuncle,	1
that	1
I	1
can	1
never	1
have	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
anything	1
that	1
I	1
can	1
eat	1
at	1
my	1
own	1
table,	1
Mrs.	1
Carbuncle,	1
since	1
I	1
was	1
married,	1
ma'am,	1
I	1
that	1
am	1
the	1
easiest	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
world	1
to	1
please	1
about	1
my	1
dinner.	1
It's	1
really	1
very	1
extraordinary,	1
Mrs.	1
Carbuncle!	1
What	1
have	1
you	1
at	1
that	1
corner	1
there,	1
under	1
the	1
cover?	1
Mar.	1
Patties,	1
sir;	1
oyster	1
patties.	1
Fred.	1
Patties,	1
ma'am!	1
kickshaws!	1
I	1
hate	1
kickshaws.	1
Not	1
worth	1
putting	1
under	1
a	1
cover,	1
ma'am.	1
And	1
why	1
not	1
have	1
glass	1
covers,	1
that	1
one	1
may	1
see	1
one's	1
dinner	1
before	1
one,	1
before	1
it	1
grows	1
cold	1
with	1
asking	1
questions,	1
Mrs.	1
Carbuncle,	1
and	1
lifting	1
up	1
covers?	1
But	1
nobody	1
has	1
any	1
sense:	1
and	1
I	1
see	1
no	1
water	1
plates	1
anywhere,	1
lately.	1
Mar.	1
Do,	1
pray,	1
doctor,	1
let	1
me	1
help	1
you	1
to	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
chicken	1
before	1
it	1
gets	1
cold,	1
my	1
dear.	1
Fred.	1
(aside).	1
"My	1
dear,"	1
again,	1
Marianne!	1
Mar.	1
Yes,	1
brother,	1
because	1
she	1
is	1
frightened,	1
you	1
know,	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Carbuncle	1
always	1
says	1
"my	1
dear"	1
to	1
him	1
when	1
she's	1
frightened,	1
and	1
looks	1
so	1
pale	1
from	1
side	1
to	1
side;	1
and	1
sometimes	1
she	1
cries	1
before	1
dinner's	1
done,	1
and	1
then	1
all	1
the	1
company	1
are	1
quite	1
silent,	1
and	1
don't	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
do."	1
"Oh,	1
such	1
a	1
little	1
creature;	1
to	1
have	1
so	1
much	1
sense,	1
too!"	1
exclaimed	1
Mrs.	1
Theresa,	1
with	1
rapture.	1
"Mr.	1
Frederick,	1
you'll	1
make	1
me	1
die	1
with	1
laughing!	1
Pray	1
go	1
on,	1
Dr.	1
Carbuncle."	1
Fred.	1
Well,	1
ma'am,	1
then	1
if	1
I	1
must	1
eat	1
something,	1
send	1
me	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
fowl;	1
a	1
leg	1
and	1
wing,	1
the	1
liver	1
wing,	1
and	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
the	1
breast,	1
oyster	1
sauce,	1
and	1
a	1
slice	1
of	1
that	1
ham,	1
if	1
you	1
please,	1
ma'am.	1
(Dr.	1
Carbuncle	1
eats	1
voraciously,	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
down	1
to	1
his	1
plate,	1
and,	1
dropping	1
the	1
sauce,	1
he	1
buttons	1
up	1
his	1
coat	1
tight	1
across	1
the	1
breast.)	1
Fred.	1
Here;	1
a	1
plate,	1
knife	1
and	1
fork,	1
bit	1
o'	1
bread,	1
a	1
glass	1
of	1
Dorchester	1
ale!	1
"Oh,	1
admirable!"	1
exclaimed	1
Mrs.	1
Tattle,	1
clapping	1
her	1
hands.	1
"Now,	1
brother,	1
suppose	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
after	1
dinner,"	1
said	1
Marianne;	1
"and	1
show	1
us	1
how	1
the	1
doctor	1
goes	1
to	1
sleep."	1
Frederick	1
threw	1
himself	1
back	1
in	1
an	1
arm-chair,	1
leaning	1
his	1
head	1
back,	1
with	1
his	1
mouth	1
open,	1
snoring;	1
nodded	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time,	1
crossed	1
and	1
uncrossed	1
his	1
legs,	1
tried	1
to	1
awake	1
himself	1
by	1
twitching	1
his	1
wig,	1
settling	1
his	1
collar,	1
blowing	1
his	1
nose	1
and	1
rapping	1
on	1
the	1
lid	1
of	1
his	1
snuff-box.	1
All	1
which	1
infinitely	1
diverted	1
Mrs.	1
Tattle,	1
who,	1
when	1
she	1
could	1
stop	1
herself	1
from	1
laughing,	1
declared	1
"It	1
made	1
her	1
sigh,	1
too,	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
the	1
life	1
poor	1
Mrs.	1
Carbuncle	1
led	1
with	1
that	1
man,	1
and	1
all	1
for	1
nothing,	1
too;	1
for	1
her	1
jointure	1
was	1
nothing,	1
next	1
to	1
nothing,	1
though	1
a	1
great	1
thing,	1
to	1
be	1
sure,	1
her	1
friends	1
thought	1
for	1
her,	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
only	1
Sally	1
Ridgeway	1
before	1
she	1
was	1
married.	1
Such	1
a	1
wife	1
as	1
she	1
makes,"	1
continued	1
Mrs.	1
Theresa,	1
lifting	1
up	1
her	1
hands	1
and	1
eyes	1
to	1
heaven,	1
"and	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
she	1
has	1
gone	1
through,	1
the	1
brute	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
ashamed	1
of	1
himself	1
if	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
leave	1
her	1
something	1
extraordinary	1
in	1
his	1
will;	1
for	1
turn	1
it	1
which	1
way	1
she	1
will,	1
she	1
can	1
never	1
keep	1
a	1
carriage,	1
or	1
live	1
like	1
anybody	1
else,	1
on	1
her	1
jointure,	1
after	1
all,	1
she	1
tells	1
me,	1
poor	1
soul!	1
A	1
sad	1
prospect,	1
after	1
her	1
husband's	1
death,	1
to	1
look	1
forward	1
to,	1
instead	1
of	1
being	1
comfortable,	1
as	1
her	1
friends	1
expected;	1
and	1
she,	1
poor	1
young	1
thing!	1
knowing	1
no	1
better	1
when	1
they	1
married	1
her!	1
People	1
should	1
look	1
into	1
these	1
things,	1
beforehand,	1
or	1
never	1
marry	1
at	1
all,	1
I	1
say,	1
Miss	1
Marianne."	1
Miss	1
Marianne,	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
clearly	1
comprehend	1
this	1
affair	1
of	1
the	1
jointure,	1
or	1
the	1
reason	1
why	1
Mrs.	1
Carbuncle	1
would	1
be	1
so	1
unhappy	1
after	1
her	1
husband's	1
death,	1
turned	1
to	1
Frederick,	1
who	1
was	1
at	1
that	1
instant	1
studying	1
Mrs.	1
Theresa	1
as	1
a	1
future	1
character	1
to	1
mimic.	1
"Brother,"	1
said	1
Marianne,	1
"now	1
sing	1
an	1
Italian	1
song	1
for	1
us	1
like	1
Miss	1
Croker.	1
Pray,	1
Miss	1
Croker,	1
favour	1
us	1
with	1
a	1
song.	1
Mrs.	1
Theresa	1
Tattle	1
has	1
never	1
had	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
hearing	1
you	1
sing;	1
she's	1
quite	1
impatient	1
to	1
hear	1
you	1
sing."	1
"Yes,	1
indeed,	1
I	1
am,"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Theresa.	1
Frederick	1
put	1
his	1
hands	1
before	1
him	1
affectedly;	1
"Oh,	1
indeed,	1
ma'am!	1
indeed,	1
ladies!	1
I	1
really	1
am	1
so	1
hoarse,	1
it	1
distresses	1
me	1
so	1
to	1
be	1
pressed	1
to	1
sing;	1
besides,	1
upon	1
my	1
word,	1
I	1
have	1
quite	1
left	1
off	1
singing.	1
I've	1
never	1
sung	1
once,	1
except	1
for	1
very	1
particular	1
people,	1
this	1
winter."	1
Mar.	1
But	1
Mrs.	1
Theresa	1
Tattle	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
particular	1
person.	1
I'm	1
sure	1
you'll	1
sing	1
for	1
her.	1
Fred.	1
Certainly,	1
ma'am,	1
I	1
allow	1
that	1
you	1
use	1
a	1
powerful	1
argument;	1
but	1
I	1
assure	1
you	1
now,	1
I	1
would	1
do	1
my	1
best	1
to	1
oblige	1
you,	1
but	1
I	1
absolutely	1
have	1
forgotten	1
all	1
my	1
English	1
songs.	1
Nobody	1
hears	1
anything	1
but	1
Italian	1
now,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
so	1
giddy	1
as	1
to	1
leave	1
my	1
Italian	1
music	1
behind	1
me.	1
Besides,	1
I	1
make	1
it	1
a	1
rule	1
never	1
to	1
hazard	1
myself	1
without	1
an	1
accompaniment.	1
Mar.	1
Oh,	1
try,	1
Miss	1
Croker,	1
for	1
once.	1
[Frederick	1
sings,	1
after	1
much	1
preluding.]	1
Violante	1
in	1
the	1
pantry,	1
Gnawing	1
of	1
a	1
mutton-bone;	1
How	1
she	1
gnawed	1
it,	1
How	1
she	1
claw'd	1
it,	1
When	1
she	1
found	1
herself	1
alone!	1
"Charming!"	1
exclaimed	1
Mrs.	1
Tattle;	1
"so	1
like	1
Miss	1
Croker,	1
I'm	1
sure	1
I	1
shall	1
think	1
of	1
you,	1
Mr.	1
Frederick,	1
when	1
I	1
hear	1
her	1
asked	1
to	1
sing	1
again.	1
Her	1
voice,	1
however,	1
introduces	1
her	1
to	1
very	1
pleasant	1
parties,	1
and	1
she's	1
a	1
girl	1
that's	1
very	1
much	1
taken	1
notice	1
of,	1
and	1
I	1
don't	1
doubt	1
will	1
go	1
off	1
vastly	1
well.	1
She's	1
a	1
particular	1
favourite	1
of	1
mine,	1
you	1
must	1
know;	1
and	1
I	1
mean	1
to	1
do	1
her	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
service	1
the	1
first	1
opportunity,	1
by	1
saying	1
something	1
or	1
other,	1
that	1
shall	1
go	1
round	1
to	1
her	1
relations	1
in	1
Northumberland,	1
and	1
make	1
them	1
do	1
something	1
for	1
her;	1
as	1
well	1
they	1
may,	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
all	1
rolling	1
in	1
gold,	1
and	1
won't	1
give	1
her	1
a	1
penny."	1
Mar.	1
Now,	1
brother,	1
read	1
the	1
newspaper	1
like	1
Counsellor	1
Puff.	1
"Oh,	1
pray	1
do,	1
Mr.	1
Frederick,	1
for	1
I	1
declare	1
I	1
admire	1
you	1
of	1
all	1
things!	1
You	1
are	1
quite	1
yourself	1
to-night.	1
Here's	1
a	1
newspaper,	1
sir,	1
pray	1
let	1
us	1
have	1
Counsellor	1
Puff.	1
It's	1
not	1
late."	1
[Frederick	1
reads	1
in	1
a	1
pompous	1
voice.]	1
"As	1
a	1
delicate	1
white	1
hand	1
has	1
ever	1
been	1
deemed	1
a	1
distinguishing	1
ornament	1
in	1
either	1
sex,	1
Messrs.	1
Valiant	1
and	1
Wise	1
conceive	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
their	1
duty	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
earliest	1
opportunity	1
to	1
advertise	1
the	1
nobility	1
and	1
gentry	1
of	1
Great	1
Britain	1
in	1
general,	1
and	1
their	1
friends	1
in	1
particular,	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
now	1
ready	1
for	1
sale,	1
as	1
usual,	1
at	1
the	1
Hippocrates'	1
Head,	1
a	1
fresh	1
assortment	1
of	1
new-invented,	1
much	1
admired,	1
primrose	1
soap.	1
To	1
prevent	1
impositions	1
and	1
counterfeits,	1
the	1
public	1
are	1
requested	1
to	1
take	1
notice,	1
that	1
the	1
only	1
genuine	1
primrose	1
soap	1
is	1
stamped	1
on	1
the	1
outside,	1
'Valiant	1
and	1
Wise.'"	1
"Oh,	1
you	1
most	1
incomparable	1
mimic!	1
'tis	1
absolutely	1
the	1
counsellor	1
himself.	1
I	1
absolutely	1
must	1
show	1
you,	1
some	1
day,	1
to	1
my	1
friend	1
Lady	1
Battersby;	1
you'd	1
absolutely	1
make	1
her	1
die	1
with	1
laughing;	1
and	1
she'd	1
quite	1
adore	1
you,"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Theresa,	1
who	1
was	1
well	1
aware	1
that	1
every	1
pause	1
must	1
be	1
filled	1
with	1
flattery.	1
"Pray	1
go	1
on,	1
pray	1
go	1
on.	1
I	1
shall	1
never	1
be	1
tired,	1
if	1
I	1
sit	1
looking	1
at	1
you	1
these	1
hundred	1
years."	1
Stimulated	1
by	1
these	1
plaudits,	1
Frederick	1
proceeded	1
to	1
show	1
how	1
Colonel	1
Epaulette	1
blew	1
his	1
nose,	1
flourished	1
his	1
cambric	1
handkerchief,	1
bowed	1
to	1
Lady	1
Diana	1
Periwinkle,	1
and	1
admired	1
her	1
work,	1
saying,	1
"Done	1
by	1
no	1
hands,	1
as	1
you	1
may	1
guess,	1
but	1
those	1
of	1
Fairly	1
Fair."	1
Whilst	1
Lady	1
Diana,	1
he	1
observed,	1
simpered	1
so	1
prettily,	1
and	1
took	1
herself	1
so	1
quietly	1
for	1
Fairly	1
Fair,	1
not	1
perceiving	1
that	1
the	1
colonel	1
was	1
admiring	1
his	1
own	1
nails	1
all	1
the	1
while.	1
Next	1
to	1
Colonel	1
Epaulette,	1
Frederick,	1
at	1
Marianne's	1
particular	1
desire,	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
like	1
Sir	1
Charles	1
Slang.	1
"Very	1
well,	1
brother,"	1
cried	1
she,	1
"your	1
hand	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
very	1
bottom	1
of	1
your	1
pocket,	1
and	1
your	1
other	1
shoulder	1
up	1
to	1
your	1
ear;	1
but	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
quite	1
wooden	1
enough,	1
and	1
you	1
should	1
walk	1
as	1
if	1
your	1
hip	1
were	1
out	1
of	1
joint.	1
There	1
now,	1
Mrs.	1
Tattle,	1
are	1
not	1
those	1
good	1
eyes?	1
They	1
stare	1
so	1
like	1
his,	1
without	1
seeming	1
to	1
see	1
anything	1
all	1
the	1
while."	1
"Excellent!	1
admirable!	1
Mr.	1
Frederick.	1
I	1
must	1
say	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
the	1
best	1
mimic	1
of	1
your	1
age	1
I	1
ever	1
saw,	1
and	1
I'm	1
sure	1
Lady	1
Battersby	1
will	1
think	1
so	1
too.	1
That	1
is	1
Sir	1
Charles	1
to	1
the	1
very	1
life.	1
But	1
with	1
all	1
that,	1
you	1
must	1
know	1
he's	1
a	1
mighty	1
pleasant,	1
fashionable	1
young	1
man	1
when	1
you	1
come	1
to	1
know	1
him,	1
and	1
has	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
sense	1
under	1
all	1
that,	1
and	1
is	1
of	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
family--the	1
Slangs,	1
you	1
know.	1
Sir	1
Charles	1
will	1
come	1
into	1
a	1
fine	1
fortune	1
himself	1
next	1
year,	1
if	1
he	1
can	1
keep	1
clear	1
of	1
gambling,	1
which	1
I	1
hear	1
is	1
his	1
foible,	1
poor	1
young	1
man!	1
Pray	1
go	1
on.	1
I	1
interrupt	1
you,	1
Mr.	1
Frederick."	1
"Now,	1
brother,"	1
said	1
Marianne.	1
"No,	1
Marianne,	1
I	1
can	1
do	1
no	1
more.	1
I'm	1
quite	1
tired,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
no	1
more,"	1
said	1
Frederick,	1
stretching	1
himself	1
at	1
full	1
length	1
upon	1
a	1
sofa.	1
Even	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
laughter,	1
and	1
whilst	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
flattery	1
yet	1
sounded	1
in	1
his	1
ear,	1
Frederick	1
felt	1
sad,	1
displeased	1
with	1
himself,	1
and	1
disgusted	1
with	1
Mrs.	1
Theresa.	1
"What	1
a	1
deep	1
sigh	1
was	1
there!"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Theresa;	1
"what	1
can	1
make	1
you	1
sigh	1
so	1
bitterly?	1
You,	1
who	1
make	1
everybody	1
else	1
laugh.	1
Oh,	1
such	1
another	1
sigh	1
again!"	1
"Marianne,"	1
cried	1
Frederick,	1
"do	1
you	1
remember	1
the	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
mask?"	1
"What	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
mask,	1
brother?"	1
"The	1
man--the	1
actor--the	1
buffoon,	1
that	1
my	1
father	1
told	1
us	1
of,	1
who	1
used	1
to	1
cry	1
behind	1
the	1
mask	1
that	1
made	1
everybody	1
else	1
laugh."	1
"Cry!	1
bless	1
me,"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Theresa,	1
"mighty	1
odd!	1
very	1
extraordinary!	1
but	1
one	1
can't	1
be	1
surprised	1
at	1
meeting	1
with	1
extraordinary	1
characters	1
amongst	1
that	1
race	1
of	1
people,	1
actors	1
by	1
profession,	1
you	1
know;	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
brought	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
egg	1
to	1
make	1
their	1
fortune,	1
or	1
at	1
least	1
their	1
bread	1
by	1
their	1
oddities.	1
But,	1
my	1
dear	1
Mr.	1
Frederick,	1
you	1
are	1
quite	1
pale,	1
quite	1
exhausted;	1
no	1
wonder--what	1
will	1
you	1
have?	1
a	1
glass	1
of	1
cowslip-wine?"	1
"Oh	1
no,	1
thank	1
you,	1
ma'am,"	1
said	1
Frederick.	1
"Oh	1
yes;	1
indeed	1
you	1
must	1
not	1
leave	1
me	1
without	1
taking	1
something;	1
and	1
Miss	1
Marianne	1
must	1
have	1
another	1
macaroon.	1
I	1
insist	1
upon	1
it,"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Theresa,	1
ringing	1
the	1
bell.	1
"It	1
is	1
not	1
late,	1
and	1
my	1
man	1
Christopher	1
will	1
bring	1
up	1
the	1
cowslip-wine	1
in	1
a	1
minute."	1
"But,	1
Sophy!	1
and	1
papa	1
and	1
mamma,	1
you	1
know,	1
will	1
come	1
home	1
presently,"	1
said	1
Marianne.	1
"Oh!	1
Miss	1
Sophy	1
has	1
her	1
books	1
and	1
drawings.	1
You	1
know	1
she's	1
never	1
afraid	1
of	1
being	1
alone.	1
Besides,	1
to-night	1
it	1
was	1
her	1
own	1
choice.	1
And	1
as	1
to	1
your	1
papa	1
and	1
mamma,	1
they	1
won't	1
be	1
home	1
to-night,	1
I'm	1
pretty	1
sure;	1
for	1
a	1
gentleman,	1
who	1
had	1
it	1
from	1
their	1
own	1
authority,	1
told	1
me	1
where	1
they	1
were	1
going,	1
which	1
is	1
further	1
off	1
than	1
they	1
think;	1
but	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
consult	1
me;	1
and	1
I	1
fancy	1
they'll	1
be	1
obliged	1
to	1
sleep	1
out;	1
so	1
you	1
need	1
not	1
be	1
in	1
a	1
hurry	1
about	1
them.	1
We'll	1
have	1
candles."	1
The	1
door	1
opened	1
just	1
as	1
Mrs.	1
Tattle	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
ring	1
the	1
bell	1
again	1
for	1
candles	1
and	1
the	1
cowslip-wine.	1
"Christopher!	1
Christopher!"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Theresa,	1
who	1
was	1
standing	1
at	1
the	1
fire,	1
with	1
her	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
door,	1
when	1
it	1
opened,	1
"Christopher!	1
pray	1
bring--Do	1
you	1
hear?"	1
but	1
no	1
Christopher	1
answered;	1
and,	1
upon	1
turning	1
round,	1
Mrs.	1
Tattle,	1
instead	1
of	1
Christopher,	1
beheld	1
two	1
little	1
black	1
figures,	1
which	1
stood	1
perfectly	1
still	1
and	1
silent.	1
It	1
was	1
so	1
dark,	1
that	1
their	1
forms	1
could	1
scarcely	1
be	1
discerned.	1
"In	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
heaven,	1
who	1
and	1
what	1
may	1
you	1
be?	1
Speak,	1
I	1
conjure	1
you!	1
what	1
are	1
ye?"	1
"The	1
chimney-sweepers,	1
ma'am,	1
an'	1
please	1
your	1
ladyship."	1
"Chimney-sweepers!"	1
repeated	1
Frederick	1
and	1
Marianne,	1
bursting	1
out	1
a-	1
laughing.	1
"Chimney-sweepers!"	1
repeated	1
Mrs.	1
Theresa,	1
provoked	1
at	1
the	1
recollection	1
of	1
her	1
late	1
solemn	1
address	1
to	1
them.	1
"Chimney-sweepers!	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
you	1
say	1
so	1
a	1
little	1
sooner?	1
Pray,	1
what	1
brings	1
you	1
here,	1
gentlemen,	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
of	1
night?"	1
"The	1
bell	1
rang,	1
ma'am,",	1
answered	1
a	1
squeaking	1
voice.	1
"The	1
bell	1
rang!	1
yes,	1
for	1
Christopher.	1
The	1
boy's	1
mad,	1
or	1
drunk."	1
"Ma'am,"	1
said	1
the	1
tallest	1
of	1
the	1
chimney-sweepers,	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
spoken,	1
and	1
who	1
now	1
began	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
blunt	1
manner;	1
"ma'am,	1
your	1
brother	1
desired	1
us	1
to	1
come	1
up	1
when	1
the	1
bell	1
rang;	1
so	1
we	1
did."	1
"My	1
brother?	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
brother,	1
dunce,"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Theresa.	1
"Mr.	1
Eden,	1
madam."	1
"Ho,	1
ho!"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Tattle,	1
in	1
a	1
more	1
complacent	1
tone,	1
"the	1
boy	1
takes	1
me	1
for	1
Miss	1
Bertha	1
Eden,	1
I	1
perceive";	1
and,	1
flattered	1
to	1
be	1
taken	1
in	1
the	1
dark	1
by	1
a	1
chimney-sweeper	1
for	1
a	1
young	1
and	1
handsome	1
lady,	1
Mrs.	1
Theresa	1
laughed,	1
and	1
informed	1
him	1
"that	1
they	1
had	1
mistaken	1
the	1
room;	1
and	1
they	1
must	1
go	1
up	1
another	1
pair	1
of	1
stairs,	1
and	1
turn	1
to	1
the	1
left."	1
The	1
chimney-sweeper	1
with	1
the	1
squeaking	1
voice	1
bowed,	1
thanked	1
her	1
ladyship	1
for	1
this	1
information,	1
said,	1
"Good	1
night	1
to	1
ye,	1
quality";	1
and	1
they	1
both	1
moved	1
towards	1
the	1
door.	1
"Stay,"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Tattle,	1
whose	1
curiosity	1
was	1
excited;	1
"what	1
can	1
the	1
Edens	1
want	1
with	1
chimney-sweepers	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
o'	1
night,	1
I	1
wonder?	1
Christopher,	1
did	1
you	1
hear	1
anything	1
about	1
it?"	1
said	1
the	1
lady	1
to	1
her	1
footman,	1
who	1
was	1
now	1
lighting	1
the	1
candles.	1
"Upon	1
my	1
word,	1
ma'am,"	1
said	1
the	1
servant,	1
"I	1
can't	1
say;	1
but	1
I'll	1
step	1
down	1
below	1
and	1
inquire.	1
I	1
heard	1
them	1
talking	1
about	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
kitchen;	1
but	1
I	1
only	1
got	1
a	1
word	1
here	1
and	1
there,	1
for	1
I	1
was	1
hunting	1
for	1
the	1
snuff-dish,	1
as	1
I	1
knew	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
for	1
candles	1
when	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
bell	1
ring,	1
ma'am;	1
so	1
I	1
thought	1
to	1
find	1
the	1
snuff-dish	1
before	1
I	1
answered	1
the	1
bell,	1
for	1
I	1
knew	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
for	1
candles	1
you	1
rang.	1
But,	1
if	1
you	1
please,	1
I'll	1
step	1
down	1
now,	1
ma'am,	1
and	1
see	1
about	1
the	1
chimney-sweepers."	1
"Yes,	1
step	1
down,	1
do;	1
and,	1
Christopher,	1
bring	1
up	1
the	1
cowslip-wine,	1
and	1
some	1
more	1
macaroons	1
for	1
my	1
little	1
Marianne."	1
Marianne	1
withdrew	1
rather	1
coldly	1
from	1
a	1
kiss	1
which	1
Mrs.	1
Tattle	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
give	1
her;	1
for	1
she	1
was	1
somewhat	1
surprised	1
at	1
the	1
familiarity	1
with	1
which	1
this	1
lady	1
talked	1
to	1
her	1
footman.	1
She	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
accustomed	1
to	1
these	1
familiarities	1
in	1
her	1
father	1
and	1
mother,	1
and	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
them.	1
"Well,"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Tattle	1
to	1
Christopher,	1
who	1
was	1
now	1
returned,	1
"what	1
is	1
the	1
news?"	1
"Ma'am,	1
the	1
little	1
fellow	1
with	1
the	1
squeaking	1
voice	1
has	1
been	1
telling	1
me	1
the	1
whole	1
story.	1
The	1
other	1
morning,	1
ma'am,	1
early,	1
he	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
were	1
down	1
the	1
hill	1
sweeping	1
in	1
Paradise	1
Row.	1
Those	1
chimneys,	1
they	1
say,	1
are	1
difficult;	1
and	1
the	1
square	1
fellow,	1
ma'am,	1
the	1
biggest	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
boys,	1
got	1
wedged	1
in	1
the	1
chimney.	1
The	1
other	1
little	1
fellow	1
was	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
top	1
at	1
the	1
time,	1
and	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
cry;	1
but	1
in	1
his	1
fright,	1
and	1
all,	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
do,	1
ma'am;	1
for	1
he	1
looked	1
about	1
from	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
chimney,	1
and	1
not	1
a	1
soul	1
could	1
he	1
see	1
stirring,	1
but	1
a	1
few	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
make	1
attend	1
to	1
his	1
screech;	1
the	1
boy	1
within	1
almost	1
stifling	1
too.	1
So	1
he	1
screeched,	1
and	1
screeched,	1
all	1
he	1
could;	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
greatest	1
chance	1
in	1
life,	1
ma'am,	1
old	1
Mr.	1
Eden	1
was	1
just	1
going	1
down	1
the	1
hill	1
to	1
fetch	1
his	1
morning	1
walk."	1
"Ay,"	1
interrupted	1
Mrs.	1
Theresa,	1
"friend	1
Ephraim	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
your	1
early	1
risers."	1
"Well,"	1
said	1
Marianne,	1
impatiently.	1
"So,	1
ma'am,	1
hearing	1
the	1
screech,	1
he	1
turns	1
and	1
sees	1
the	1
sweep;	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
he	1
understands	1
the	1
matter--"	1
"I'm	1
sure	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
taken	1
some	1
time	1
to	1
understand	1
it,"	1
interposed	1
Mrs.	1
Tattle,	1
"for	1
he's	1
the	1
slowest	1
creature	1
breathing,	1
and	1
the	1
deafest	1
in	1
company.	1
Go	1
on,	1
Christopher.	1
So	1
the	1
sweep	1
did	1
make	1
him	1
hear."	1
"So	1
he	1
says,	1
ma'am;	1
and	1
so	1
the	1
old	1
gentleman	1
went	1
in	1
and	1
pulled	1
the	1
boy	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
chimney,	1
with	1
much	1
ado,	1
ma'am."	1
"Bless	1
me!"	1
exclaimed	1
Mrs.	1
Theresa;	1
"but	1
did	1
old	1
Eden	1
go	1
up	1
the	1
chimney	1
himself	1
after	1
the	1
boy,	1
wig	1
and	1
all?	1
"Why,	1
ma'am,"	1
said	1
Christopher,	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
great	1
delight,	1
"that	1
was	1
all	1
as	1
one,	1
as	1
the	1
very	1
'dentical	1
words	1
I	1
put	1
to	1
the	1
boy	1
myself,	1
when	1
he	1
telled	1
me	1
his	1
story.	1
But,	1
ma'am,	1
that	1
was	1
what	1
I	1
couldn't	1
get	1
out	1
of	1
him,	1
neither,	1
rightly,	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
churl--the	1
big	1
boy	1
that	1
was	1
stuck	1
in	1
the	1
chimney,	1
I	1
mean;	1
for	1
when	1
I	1
put	1
the	1
question	1
to	1
him	1
about	1
the	1
wig,	1
laughing	1
like,	1
he	1
wouldn't	1
take	1
it	1
laughing	1
like	1
at	1
all;	1
but	1
would	1
only	1
make	1
answer	1
to	1
us	1
like	1
a	1
bear,	1
'He	1
saved	1
my	1
life,	1
that's	1
all	1
I	1
know';	1
and	1
this	1
over	1
again,	1
ma'am,	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
kitchen	1
round,	1
that	1
cross-questioned	1
him.	1
But	1
I	1
finds	1
him	1
stupid	1
and	1
ill-mannered	1
like,	1
for	1
I	1
offered	1
him	1
a	1
shilling,	1
ma'am,	1
myself,	1
to	1
tell	1
about	1
the	1
wig;	1
but	1
he	1
put	1
it	1
back	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
that	1
did	1
not	1
become	1
such	1
as	1
he,	1
to	1
no	1
lady's	1
butler,	1
ma'am;	1
whereupon	1
I	1
turns	1
to	1
the	1
slim	1
fellow	1
(and	1
he's	1
smarterer,	1
and	1
more	1
mannerly,	1
ma'am,	1
with	1
a	1
tongue	1
in	1
his	1
head	1
for	1
his	1
betters),	1
but	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
resolve	1
me	1
my	1
question	1
either;	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
chimney	1
the	1
best	1
part	1
o'	1
the	1
time:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
down	1
Mr.	1
Eden	1
had	1
his	1
wig	1
on,	1
but	1
had	1
his	1
arm	1
all	1
bare	1
and	1
bloody,	1
ma'am."	1
"Poor	1
Mr.	1
Eden!"	1
exclaimed	1
Marianne.	1
"Oh,	1
miss,"	1
continued	1
the	1
servant,	1
"and	1
the	1
chimney-sweep	1
himself	1
was	1
so	1
bruised,	1
and	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
killed."	1
"Well,	1
well!	1
but	1
he's	1
alive	1
now;	1
go	1
on	1
with	1
your	1
story,	1
Christopher,"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
T.	1
"Chimney-sweepers	1
get	1
wedged	1
in	1
chimneys	1
every	1
day;	1
it's	1
part	1
of	1
their	1
trade,	1
and	1
it's	1
a	1
happy	1
thing	1
when	1
they	1
come	1
off	1
with	1
a	1
few	1
bruises.*	1
To	1
be	1
sure,"	1
added	1
she,	1
observing	1
that	1
both	1
Frederick	1
and	1
Marianne	1
looked	1
displeased	1
at	1
this	1
speech,	1
"to	1
be	1
sure,	1
if	1
one	1
may	1
believe	1
this	1
story,	1
there	1
was	1
some	1
real	1
danger."	1
*This	1
atrocious	1
practice	1
is	1
now	1
happily	1
superseded	1
by	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
sweeping	1
machines.	1
"Real	1
danger!	1
yes,	1
indeed,"	1
said	1
Marianne;	1
"and	1
I'm	1
sure	1
I	1
think	1
Mr.	1
Eden	1
was	1
very	1
good."	1
"Certainly	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
most	1
commendable	1
action,	1
and	1
quite	1
providential.	1
So	1
I	1
shall	1
take	1
an	1
opportunity	1
of	1
saying,	1
when	1
I	1
tell	1
the	1
story	1
in	1
all	1
companies;	1
and	1
the	1
boy	1
may	1
thank	1
his	1
kind	1
stars,	1
I'm	1
sure,	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
his	1
days,	1
for	1
such	1
an	1
escape--But	1
pray,	1
Christopher,"	1
said	1
she,	1
persisting	1
in	1
her	1
conversation	1
with	1
Christopher,	1
who	1
was	1
now	1
laying	1
the	1
cloth	1
for	1
supper,	1
"pray,	1
which	1
house	1
was	1
it	1
in	1
Paradise	1
Row?	1
where	1
the	1
Eagles	1
or	1
the	1
Miss	1
Ropers	1
lodge?	1
or	1
which?"	1
"It	1
was	1
at	1
my	1
Lady	1
Battersby's,	1
ma'am."	1
"Ha!	1
ha!"	1
cried	1
Mrs.	1
Theresa,	1
"I	1
thought	1
we	1
should	1
get	1
to	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
affair	1
at	1
last.	1
This	1
is	1
excellent!	1
This	1
will	1
make	1
an	1
admirable	1
story	1
for	1
my	1
Lady	1
Battersby	1
the	1
next	1
time	1
I	1
see	1
her.	1
These	1
Quakers	1
are	1
so	1
sly!	1
Old	1
Eden,	1
I	1
know,	1
has	1
long	1
wanted	1
to	1
obtain	1
an	1
introduction	1
into	1
that	1
house;	1
and	1
a	1
charming	1
charitable	1
expedient	1
hit	1
upon!	1
My	1
Lady	1
Battersby	1
will	1
enjoy	1
this,	1
of	1
all	1
things."	1
CHAPTER	1
III.	1
"Now,"	1
continued	1
Mrs.	1
Theresa,	1
turning	1
to	1
Frederick,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
servant	1
had	1
left	1
the	1
room,	1
"now,	1
Mr.	1
Frederick	1
Montague,	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
favour-	1
-such	1
a	1
favour--to	1
ask	1
of	1
you;	1
it's	1
a	1
favour	1
which	1
only	1
you	1
can	1
grant;	1
you	1
have	1
such	1
talents,	1
and	1
would	1
do	1
the	1
thing	1
so	1
admirably;	1
and	1
my	1
Lady	1
Battersby	1
would	1
quite	1
adore	1
you	1
for	1
it.	1
She	1
will	1
do	1
me	1
the	1
honour	1
to	1
be	1
here	1
to	1
spend	1
an	1
evening	1
to-morrow.	1
I'm	1
convinced	1
Mr.	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Montague	1
will	1
find	1
themselves	1
obliged	1
to	1
stay	1
out	1
another	1
day,	1
and	1
I	1
so	1
long	1
to	1
show	1
you	1
off	1
to	1
her	1
ladyship;	1
and	1
your	1
Doctor	1
Carbuncle,	1
and	1
your	1
Counsellor	1
Puff,	1
and	1
your	1
Miss	1
Croker,	1
and	1
all	1
your	1
charming	1
characters.	1
You	1
must	1
let	1
me	1
introduce	1
you	1
to	1
her	1
ladyship	1
to-morrow	1
evening.	1
Promise	1
me."	1
"Oh,	1
ma'am,"	1
said	1
Frederick,	1
"I	1
cannot	1
promise	1
you	1
any	1
such	1
thing,	1
indeed.	1
I	1
am	1
much	1
obliged	1
to	1
you;	1
but	1
indeed	1
I	1
cannot	1
come."	1
"Why	1
not,	1
my	1
dear	1
sir?	1
why	1
not?	1
You	1
don't	1
think	1
I	1
mean	1
you	1
should	1
promise,	1
if	1
you	1
are	1
certain	1
your	1
papa	1
and	1
mamma	1
will	1
be	1
home."	1
"If	1
they	1
do	1
come	1
home,	1
I	1
will	1
ask	1
them	1
about	1
it,"	1
said	1
Frederick,	1
hesitating;	1
for	1
though	1
he	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
wished	1
to	1
accept	1
the	1
invitation,	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
acquired	1
the	1
necessary	1
power	1
of	1
decidedly	1
saying	1
No.	1
"Ask	1
them!"	1
repeated	1
Mrs.	1
Theresa.	1
"My	1
dear	1
sir,	1
at	1
your	1
age,	1
must	1
you	1
ask	1
your	1
papa	1
and	1
mamma	1
about	1
such	1
things?"	1
"Must!	1
no,	1
ma'am,"	1
said	1
Frederick;	1
"but	1
I	1
said	1
I	1
would.	1
I	1
know	1
I	1
need	1
not,	1
because	1
my	1
father	1
and	1
mother	1
always	1
let	1
me	1
judge	1
for	1
myself	1
almost	1
about	1
everything."	1
"And	1
about	1
this,	1
I	1
am	1
sure,"	1
cried	1
Marianne.	1
"Papa	1
and	1
mamma,	1
you	1
know,	1
just	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
going	1
away,	1
said,	1
'If	1
Mrs.	1
Theresa	1
asks	1
you	1
to	1
come,	1
do	1
as	1
you	1
think	1
best'"	1
"Well,	1
then,"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Theresa,	1
"you	1
know	1
it	1
rests	1
with	1
yourselves,	1
if	1
you	1
may	1
do	1
as	1
you	1
please."	1
"To	1
be	1
sure	1
I	1
may,	1
madam,"	1
said	1
Frederick,	1
colouring	1
from	1
that	1
species	1
of	1
emotion	1
which	1
is	1
justly	1
called	1
false	1
shame,	1
and	1
which	1
often	1
conquers	1
real	1
shame;	1
"to	1
be	1
sure,	1
ma'am,	1
I	1
may	1
do	1
as	1
I	1
please."	1
"Then	1
I	1
may	1
make	1
sure	1
of	1
you,"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Theresa;	1
"for	1
now	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
downright	1
rudeness	1
to	1
tell	1
a	1
lady	1
you	1
won't	1
do	1
as	1
she	1
pleases.	1
Mr.	1
Frederick	1
Montague,	1
I'm	1
sure,	1
is	1
too	1
wellbred	1
a	1
young	1
gentleman	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
unpolite,	1
so	1
ungallant	1
a	1
thing!"	1
The	1
jargon	1
of	1
politeness	1
and	1
gallantry	1
is	1
frequently	1
brought	1
by	1
the	1
silly	1
acquaintance	1
of	1
young	1
people	1
to	1
confuse	1
their	1
simple	1
morality	1
and	1
clear	1
good	1
sense.	1
A	1
new	1
and	1
unintelligible	1
system	1
is	1
presented	1
to	1
them,	1
in	1
a	1
language	1
foreign	1
to	1
their	1
understanding,	1
and	1
contradictory	1
to	1
their	1
feelings.	1
They	1
hesitate	1
between	1
new	1
motives	1
and	1
old	1
principles.	1
From	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
being	1
thought	1
ignorant,	1
they	1
become	1
affected;	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
dread	1
of	1
being	1
thought	1
to	1
be	1
children	1
act	1
like	1
fools.	1
But	1
all	1
this	1
they	1
feel	1
only	1
when	1
they	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
company	1
of	1
such	1
people	1
as	1
Mrs.	1
Theresa	1
Tattle.	1
"Ma'am,"	1
Frederick	1
began,	1
"I	1
don't	1
mean	1
to	1
be	1
rude;	1
but	1
I	1
hope	1
you'll	1
excuse	1
me	1
from	1
coming	1
to	1
drink	1
tea	1
with	1
you	1
to-morrow,	1
because	1
my	1
father	1
and	1
mother	1
are	1
not	1
acquainted	1
with	1
Lady	1
Battersby,	1
and	1
maybe	1
they	1
might	1
not	1
like--"	1
"Take	1
care,	1
take	1
care,"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Theresa,	1
laughing	1
at	1
his	1
perplexity:	1
"you	1
want	1
to	1
get	1
off	1
from	1
obliging	1
me,	1
and	1
you	1
don't	1
know	1
how.	1
You	1
had	1
very	1
nearly	1
made	1
a	1
most	1
shocking	1
blunder	1
in	1
putting	1
it	1
all	1
upon	1
poor	1
Lady	1
Battersby.	1
Now	1
you	1
know	1
it's	1
impossible	1
that	1
Mr.	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Montague	1
could	1
have	1
in	1
nature	1
the	1
slightest	1
objection	1
to	1
introducing	1
you	1
to	1
my	1
Lady	1
Battersby	1
at	1
my	1
own	1
house;	1
for,	1
don't	1
you	1
know,	1
that,	1
besides	1
her	1
ladyship's	1
many	1
unquestionable	1
qualities,	1
which	1
one	1
need	1
not	1
talk	1
of,	1
she	1
is	1
cousin,	1
but	1
once	1
removed,	1
to	1
the	1
Trotters	1
of	1
Lancashire--your	1
mother's	1
great	1
favourites?	1
And	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
person	1
at	1
the	1
Wells,	1
I'll	1
venture	1
to	1
say,	1
could	1
be	1
of	1
more	1
advantage	1
to	1
your	1
sister	1
Sophy,	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
partners,	1
when	1
she	1
comes	1
to	1
go	1
the	1
balls,	1
which	1
it's	1
to	1
be	1
supposed	1
she	1
will,	1
some	1
time	1
or	1
other;	1
and	1
as	1
you	1
are	1
so	1
good	1
a	1
brother,	1
that's	1
a	1
thing	1
to	1
be	1
looked	1
to,	1
you	1
know.	1
Besides,	1
as	1
to	1
yourself,	1
there's	1
nothing	1
her	1
ladyship	1
delights	1
in	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
in	1
a	1
good	1
mimic;	1
and	1
she'll	1
quite	1
adore	1
you!"	1
"But	1
I	1
don't	1
want	1
her	1
to	1
adore	1
me,	1
ma'am,"	1
said	1
Frederick,	1
bluntly;	1
then,	1
correcting	1
himself,	1
added,	1
"I	1
mean	1
for	1
being	1
a	1
mimic."	1
"Why	1
not,	1
my	1
love?	1
Between	1
friends,	1
can	1
there	1
be	1
any	1
harm	1
in	1
showing	1
one's	1
talents?	1
You	1
that	1
have	1
such	1
talents	1
to	1
show.	1
She'll	1
keep	1
your	1
secret,	1
I'll	1
answer	1
for	1
her;	1
and,"	1
added	1
she,	1
"you	1
needn't	1
be	1
afraid	1
of	1
her	1
criticism;	1
for,	1
between	1
you	1
and	1
me,	1
she's	1
no	1
great	1
critic;	1
so	1
you'll	1
come.	1
Well,	1
thank	1
you,	1
that's	1
settled.	1
How	1
you	1
have	1
made	1
me	1
beg	1
and	1
pray!	1
but	1
you	1
know	1
your	1
own	1
value,	1
I	1
see;	1
as	1
you	1
entertaining	1
people	1
always	1
do.	1
One	1
must	1
ask	1
a	1
wit,	1
like	1
a	1
fine	1
singer,	1
so	1
often.	1
Well,	1
but	1
now	1
for	1
the	1
favour	1
I	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
ask	1
you."	1
Frederick	1
looked	1
surprised;	1
for	1
he	1
thought	1
that	1
the	1
favour	1
of	1
his	1
company	1
was	1
what	1
she	1
meant:	1
but	1
she	1
explained	1
herself	1
farther.	1
"As	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
Quaker	1
who	1
lodges	1
above,	1
old	1
Ephraim	1
Eden--my	1
Lady	1
Battersby	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
so	1
much	1
diversion	1
about	1
him.	1
He	1
is	1
the	1
best	1
character,	1
the	1
oddest	1
creature!	1
If	1
you	1
were	1
but	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
rooms	1
with	1
those	1
stiff	1
skirts,	1
or	1
walking	1
with	1
his	1
eternal	1
sister	1
Bertha,	1
and	1
his	1
everlasting	1
broad-brimmed	1
hat!	1
One	1
knows	1
him	1
a	1
mile	1
off!	1
But	1
then	1
his	1
voice	1
and	1
way,	1
and	1
altogether,	1
if	1
one	1
could	1
get	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
life,	1
they'd	1
be	1
better	1
than	1
anything	1
on	1
the	1
stage;	1
better	1
even	1
than	1
anything	1
I've	1
seen	1
to-night;	1
and	1
I	1
think	1
you'd	1
make	1
a	1
capital	1
Quaker	1
for	1
my	1
Lady	1
Battersby;	1
but	1
then	1
the	1
thing	1
is,	1
one	1
can	1
never	1
get	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
old	1
quiz	1
talk.	1
Now	1
you,	1
who	1
have	1
so	1
much	1
invention	1
and	1
cleverness--I	1
have	1
no	1
invention	1
myself;	1
but	1
could	1
you	1
not	1
hit	1
upon	1
some	1
way	1
of	1
seeing	1
him,	1
so	1
that	1
you	1
might	1
get	1
him	1
by	1
heart?	1
I'm	1
sure	1
you,	1
who	1
are	1
so	1
quick,	1
would	1
only	1
want	1
to	1
see	1
him,	1
and	1
hear	1
him,	1
for	1
half	1
a	1
minute,	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
take	1
him	1
off,	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
kill	1
one	1
with	1
laughing.	1
But	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
invention."	1
"Oh,	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
invention,"	1
said	1
Frederick,	1
"I	1
know	1
an	1
admirable	1
way	1
of	1
doing	1
the	1
thing,	1
if	1
that	1
is	1
all;	1
but	1
then	1
remember,	1
I	1
don't	1
say	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
the	1
thing,	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
not.	1
But	1
I	1
know	1
a	1
way	1
of	1
getting	1
up	1
into	1
his	1
room,	1
and	1
seeing	1
him,	1
without	1
his	1
knowing	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
there."	1
"Oh,	1
tell	1
it	1
me,	1
you	1
charming,	1
clever	1
creature!"	1
"But,	1
remember,	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
say	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
it."	1
"Well,	1
well,	1
let	1
us	1
hear	1
it;	1
and	1
you	1
shall	1
do	1
as	1
you	1
please	1
afterwards.	1
Merciful	1
goodness!"	1
exclaimed	1
Mrs.	1
Tattle,	1
"do	1
my	1
ears	1
deceive	1
me?	1
I	1
declare	1
I	1
looked	1
round,	1
and	1
thought	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
squeaking	1
chimney-sweeper	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
room!"	1
"So	1
did	1
I,	1
Frederick,	1
I	1
declare,"	1
cried	1
Marianne,	1
laughing,	1
"I	1
never	1
heard	1
anything	1
so	1
like	1
his	1
voice	1
in	1
my	1
life."	1
Frederick	1
imitated	1
the	1
squeaking	1
voice	1
of	1
this	1
chimney-sweeper	1
to	1
great	1
perfection.	1
"Now,"	1
continued	1
he,	1
"this	1
fellow	1
is	1
just	1
my	1
height.	1
The	1
old	1
Quaker,	1
if	1
my	1
face	1
were	1
blackened,	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
were	1
to	1
change	1
clothes	1
with	1
the	1
chimney-	1
sweeper,	1
I'll	1
answer	1
for	1
it,	1
would	1
never	1
know	1
me."	1
"Oh,	1
it's	1
an	1
admirable	1
invention!	1
I	1
give	1
you	1
infinite	1
credit	1
for	1
it!"	1
exclaimed	1
Mrs.	1
Theresa.	1
"It	1
shall,	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
done.	1
I'll	1
ring,	1
and	1
have	1
the	1
fellow	1
up	1
this	1
minute."	1
"Oh,	1
no;	1
do	1
not	1
ring,"	1
said	1
Frederick,	1
stopping	1
her	1
hand,	1
"I	1
don't	1
mean	1
to	1
do	1
it.	1
You	1
know	1
you	1
promised	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
do	1
as	1
I	1
pleased.	1
I	1
only	1
told	1
you	1
my	1
invention."	1
"Well,	1
well;	1
but	1
only	1
let	1
me	1
ring,	1
and	1
ask	1
whether	1
the	1
chimney-sweepers	1
are	1
below.	1
You	1
shall	1
do	1
as	1
you	1
please	1
afterwards."	1
"Christopher,	1
shut	1
the	1
door.	1
Christopher,"	1
said	1
she	1
to	1
the	1
servant	1
who	1
came	1
up	1
when	1
she	1
rang,	1
"pray	1
are	1
the	1
sweeps	1
gone	1
yet?"	1
"No,	1
ma'am."	1
"But	1
have	1
they	1
been	1
up	1
to	1
old	1
Eden	1
yet?"	1
"Oh,	1
no,	1
ma'am;	1
nor	1
be	1
not	1
to	1
go	1
till	1
the	1
bell	1
rings;	1
for	1
Miss	1
Bertha,	1
ma'am,	1
was	1
asleep	1
a-lying	1
down,	1
and	1
her	1
brother	1
wouldn't	1
have	1
her	1
wakened	1
on	1
no	1
account	1
whatsomever.	1
He	1
came	1
down	1
hisself	1
to	1
the	1
kitchen	1
to	1
the	1
sweeps,	1
though;	1
but	1
wouldn't	1
have,	1
as	1
I	1
heard	1
him	1
say,	1
his	1
sister	1
waked	1
for	1
no	1
account.	1
But	1
Miss	1
Bertha's	1
bell	1
will	1
ring	1
when	1
she	1
wakens	1
for	1
the	1
sweeps,	1
ma'am.	1
'Twas	1
she	1
wanted	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
boy	1
as	1
her	1
brother	1
saved,	1
and	1
I	1
suppose	1
sent	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
something	1
charitable,	1
ma'am."	1
"Well,	1
never	1
mind	1
your	1
suppositions,"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Theresa;	1
"run	1
down	1
this	1
very	1
minute	1
to	1
the	1
little	1
squeaking	1
chimney-sweep,	1
and	1
send	1
him	1
up	1
to	1
me.	1
Quick,	1
but	1
don't	1
let	1
the	1
other	1
bear	1
come	1
up	1
with	1
him."	1
Christopher,	1
who	1
had	1
curiosity,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
his	1
mistress,	1
when	1
he	1
returned	1
with	1
the	1
chimney-sweeper,	1
prolonged	1
his	1
own	1
stay	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
by	1
sweeping	1
the	1
hearth,	1
throwing	1
down	1
the	1
tongs	1
and	1
shovel,	1
and	1
picking	1
them	1
up	1
again.	1
"That	1
will	1
do,	1
Christopher!	1
Christopher,	1
that	1
will	1
do,	1
I	1
say,"	1
Mrs.	1
Theresa	1
repeated	1
in	1
vain.	1
She	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
say,	1
"Christopher,	1
you	1
may	1
go,"	1
before	1
he	1
would	1
depart.	1
"Now,"	1
said	1
she	1
to	1
Frederick,	1
"step	1
in	1
here	1
to	1
the	1
next	1
room	1
with	1
this	1
candle,	1
and	1
you'll	1
be	1
equipped	1
in	1
an	1
instant.	1
Only	1
just	1
change	1
clothes	1
with	1
the	1
boy;	1
only	1
just	1
let	1
me	1
see	1
what	1
a	1
charming	1
chimney-sweeper	1
you'd	1
make.	1
You	1
shall	1
do	1
as	1
you	1
please	1
afterwards."	1
"Well,	1
I'll	1
only	1
change	1
clothes	1
with	1
him,	1
just	1
to	1
show	1
you	1
for	1
one	1
minute."	1
"But,"	1
said	1
Marianne	1
to	1
Mrs.	1
Theresa	1
whilst	1
Frederick	1
was	1
changing	1
his	1
clothes,	1
"I	1
think	1
Frederick	1
is	1
right	1
about--"	1
"About	1
what,	1
love?"	1
"I	1
think	1
he	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
right	1
not	1
to	1
go	1
up,	1
though	1
he	1
can	1
do	1
it	1
so	1
easily,	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
gentleman;	1
I	1
mean	1
on	1
purpose	1
to	1
mimic	1
and	1
laugh	1
at	1
him	1
afterwards.	1
I	1
don't	1
think	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
quite	1
right."	1
"Why,	1
pray,	1
Miss	1
Marianne?"	1
"Why,	1
because	1
he	1
is	1
so	1
good-natured	1
to	1
his	1
sister.	1
He	1
would	1
not	1
let	1
her	1
be	1
wakened."	1
"Dear,	1
it's	1
easy	1
to	1
be	1
good	1
in	1
such	1
little	1
things;	1
and	1
he	1
won't	1
have	1
long	1
to	1
be	1
good	1
to	1
her	1
neither;	1
for	1
I	1
don't	1
think	1
she	1
will	1
trouble	1
him	1
long	1
in	1
this	1
world,	1
anyhow."	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
mean?"	1
said	1
Marianne.	1
"That	1
she'll	1
die,	1
child."	1
"Die!	1
die	1
with	1
that	1
beautiful	1
colour	1
in	1
her	1
cheeks!	1
How	1
sorry	1
her	1
poor,	1
poor	1
brother	1
will	1
be!	1
But	1
she	1
will	1
not	1
die,	1
I'm	1
sure,	1
for	1
she	1
walks	1
about	1
and	1
runs	1
upstairs	1
so	1
lightly!	1
Oh,	1
you	1
must	1
be	1
quite	1
mistaken,	1
I	1
hope."	1
"If	1
I'm	1
mistaken,	1
Dr.	1
Panado	1
Cardamum's	1
mistaken	1
too,	1
then,	1
that's	1
my	1
comfort.	1
He	1
says,	1
unless	1
the	1
waters	1
work	1
a	1
miracle,	1
she	1
stands	1
a	1
bad	1
chance;	1
and	1
she	1
won't	1
follow	1
my	1
advice,	1
and	1
consult	1
the	1
doctor	1
for	1
her	1
health."	1
"He	1
would	1
frighten	1
her	1
to	1
death,	1
perhaps,"	1
said	1
Marianne.	1
"I	1
hope	1
Frederick	1
won't	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
disturb	1
her."	1
"Lud,	1
child,	1
you	1
are	1
turned	1
simpleton	1
all	1
of	1
a	1
sudden;	1
how	1
can	1
your	1
brother	1
disturb	1
her	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
real	1
chimney-sweeper?"	1
"But	1
I	1
don't	1
think	1
it's	1
right,"	1
persisted	1
Marianne,	1
"and	1
I	1
shall	1
tell	1
him	1
so."	1
"Nay,	1
Miss	1
Marianne,	1
I	1
don't	1
commend	1
you	1
now.	1
Young	1
ladies	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
so	1
forward	1
to	1
give	1
opinions	1
and	1
advice	1
to	1
their	1
elder	1
brothers	1
unasked;	1
and	1
I	1
presume	1
that	1
Mr.	1
Frederick	1
and	1
I	1
must	1
know	1
what's	1
right	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
Miss	1
Marianne.	1
Hush!	1
here	1
he	1
is.	1
Oh,	1
the	1
capital	1
figure!"	1
cried	1
Mrs.	1
Theresa.	1
"Bravo,	1
bravo!"	1
cried	1
she,	1
as	1
Frederick	1
entered	1
in	1
the	1
chimney-	1
sweeper's	1
dress;	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
spoke,	1
saying,	1
"I'm	1
afraid,	1
please	1
your	1
ladyship,	1
to	1
dirt	1
your	1
ladyship's	1
carpet,"	1
she	1
broke	1
out	1
into	1
immoderate	1
raptures,	1
calling	1
him	1
"her	1
charming	1
chimney-sweeper!"	1
and	1
repeating	1
that	1
she	1
knew	1
beforehand	1
the	1
character	1
would	1
do	1
for	1
him.	1
Mrs.	1
Theresa	1
instantly	1
rang	1
the	1
bell,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
expostulation--	1
ordered	1
Christopher	1
to	1
send	1
up	1
the	1
other	1
chimney-sweeper--triumphed	1
in	1
observing	1
that	1
Christopher	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
Frederick	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
room;	1
and	1
offered	1
to	1
lay	1
any	1
wager	1
that	1
the	1
other	1
chimney-sweeper	1
would	1
mistake	1
him	1
for	1
his	1
companion.	1
And	1
so	1
he	1
did;	1
and	1
when	1
Frederick	1
spoke,	1
the	1
voice	1
was	1
so	1
very	1
like,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
scarcely	1
possible	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
have	1
perceived	1
the	1
difference.	1
Marianne	1
was	1
diverted	1
by	1
this	1
scene;	1
but	1
she	1
started,	1
when	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
it	1
they	1
heard	1
a	1
bell	1
ring.	1
"That's	1
the	1
lady's	1
bell,	1
and	1
we	1
must	1
go,"	1
said	1
the	1
blunt	1
chimney-sweeper.	1
"Go,	1
then,	1
about	1
your	1
business,"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Theresa,	1
"and	1
here's	1
a	1
shilling	1
for	1
you,	1
to	1
drink,	1
my	1
honest	1
fellow.	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
you	1
were	1
so	1
much	1
bruised	1
when	1
I	1
first	1
saw	1
you.	1
I	1
won't	1
detain	1
you.	1
Go,"	1
said	1
she,	1
pushing	1
Frederick	1
towards	1
the	1
door.	1
Marianne	1
sprang	1
forward	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
him;	1
but	1
Mrs.	1
Theresa	1
kept	1
her	1
off;	1
and,	1
though	1
Frederick	1
resisted,	1
the	1
lady	1
shut	1
the	1
door	1
upon	1
him	1
by	1
superior	1
force,	1
and,	1
having	1
locked	1
it,	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
retreat.	1
Mrs.	1
Tattle	1
and	1
Marianne	1
waited	1
impatiently	1
for	1
Frederick's	1
return.	1
"I	1
hear	1
them,"	1
cried	1
Marianne,	1
"I	1
hear	1
them	1
coming	1
downstairs."	1
They	1
listened	1
again,	1
and	1
all	1
was	1
silent.	1
At	1
length	1
they	1
suddenly	1
heard	1
a	1
great	1
noise	1
of	1
many	1
steps	1
in	1
the	1
hall.	1
"Merciful!"	1
exclaimed	1
Mrs.	1
Theresa,	1
"it	1
must	1
be	1
your	1
father	1
and	1
mother	1
come	1
back."	1
Marianne	1
ran	1
to	1
unlock	1
the	1
room	1
door,	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Theresa	1
followed	1
her	1
into	1
the	1
hall.	1
The	1
hall	1
was	1
rather	1
dark,	1
but	1
under	1
the	1
lamp	1
a	1
crowd	1
of	1
people,	1
all	1
the	1
servants	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
having	1
gathered	1
together.	1
As	1
Mrs.	1
Theresa	1
approached,	1
the	1
crowd	1
opened	1
in	1
silence,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
she	1
beheld	1
Frederick,	1
with	1
blood	1
streaming	1
from	1
his	1
face.	1
His	1
head	1
was	1
held	1
by	1
Christopher;	1
and	1
the	1
chimney-sweeper	1
was	1
holding	1
a	1
basin	1
for	1
him.	1
"Merciful!	1
what	1
will	1
become	1
of	1
me?"	1
exclaimed	1
Mrs.	1
Theresa.	1
"Bleeding!	1
he'll	1
bleed	1
to	1
death!	1
Can	1
nobody	1
think	1
of	1
anything	1
that	1
will	1
stop	1
blood	1
in	1
a	1
minute?	1
A	1
key,	1
a	1
large	1
key	1
down	1
his	1
back--a	1
key--has	1
nobody	1
a	1
key?	1
Mr.	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Montague	1
will	1
be	1
here	1
before	1
he	1
has	1
done	1
bleeding.	1
A	1
key!	1
cobwebs!	1
a	1
puff	1
ball!	1
for	1
mercy's	1
sake!	1
Can	1
nobody	1
think	1
of	1
anything	1
that	1
will	1
stop	1
blood	1
in	1
a	1
minute?	1
Gracious	1
me!	1
he'll	1
bleed	1
to	1
death,	1
I	1
believe."	1
"He'll	1
bleed	1
to	1
death!	1
Oh,	1
my	1
brother!"	1
cried	1
Marianne,	1
catching	1
hold	1
of	1
the	1
words;	1
and	1
terrified,	1
she	1
ran	1
upstairs,	1
crying,	1
"Sophy,	1
oh,	1
Sophy!	1
come	1
down	1
this	1
minute,	1
or	1
he'll	1
be	1
dead!	1
My	1
brother's	1
bleeding	1
to	1
death!	1
Sophy!	1
Sophy!	1
come	1
down,	1
or	1
he'll	1
be	1
dead!"	1
"Let	1
go	1
the	1
basin,	1
you,"	1
said	1
Christopher,	1
pulling	1
the	1
basin	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
chimney-sweeper's	1
hand,	1
who	1
had	1
all	1
this	1
time	1
stood	1
in	1
silence;	1
"you	1
are	1
not	1
fit	1
to	1
hold	1
the	1
basin	1
for	1
a	1
gentleman."	1
"Let	1
him	1
hold	1
it,"	1
said	1
Frederick;	1
"he	1
did	1
not	1
mean	1
to	1
hurt	1
me."	1
"That's	1
more	1
than	1
he	1
deserves.	1
I'm	1
certain	1
sure	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
known	1
well	1
enough	1
it	1
was	1
Mr.	1
Frederick	1
all	1
the	1
time,	1
and	1
he'd	1
no	1
business	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
fight--such	1
a	1
one	1
as	1
he--with	1
a	1
gentleman."	1
"I	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
gentleman!"	1
said	1
the	1
chimney-sweeper,	1
"how	1
could	1
I?"	1
"How	1
could	1
he,	1
indeed!"	1
said	1
Frederick;	1
"he	1
shall	1
hold	1
the	1
basin."	1
"Gracious	1
me!	1
I'm	1
glad	1
to	1
hear	1
him	1
speak	1
like	1
himself	1
again,	1
at	1
anyrate,"	1
cried	1
Mrs.	1
Theresa.	1
"And	1
here	1
comes	1
Miss	1
Sophy,	1
too."	1
"Sophy!"	1
cried	1
Frederick.	1
"Oh,	1
Sophy,	1
don't	1
you	1
come--don't	1
look	1
at	1
me;	1
you'll	1
despise	1
me."	1
"My	1
brother!	1
where?	1
where?"	1
said	1
Sophy,	1
looking,	1
as	1
she	1
thought,	1
at	1
the	1
two	1
chimney-sweepers.	1
"It's	1
Frederick,"	1
said	1
Marianne:	1
"that's	1
my	1
brother."	1
"Miss	1
Sophy,	1
don't	1
be	1
alarmed,"	1
Mrs.	1
Theresa	1
began;	1
"but	1
gracious	1
goodness!	1
I	1
wish	1
Miss	1
Bertha--"	1
At	1
this	1
instant	1
a	1
female	1
figure	1
in	1
white	1
appeared	1
upon	1
the	1
stairs;	1
she	1
passed	1
swiftly	1
on,	1
whilst	1
everyone	1
gave	1
way	1
before	1
her.	1
"Oh,	1
Miss	1
Bertha!"	1
cried	1
Mrs.	1
Theresa,	1
catching	1
hold	1
of	1
her	1
gown	1
to	1
stop	1
her,	1
as	1
she	1
came	1
near	1
Frederick.	1
"Oh,	1
Miss	1
Eden,	1
your	1
beautiful	1
India	1
muslin!	1
take	1
care	1
of	1
the	1
chimney	1
sweeper,	1
for	1
heaven's	1
sake."	1
But	1
she	1
pressed	1
forward.	1
"It's	1
my	1
brother,	1
will	1
he	1
die?"	1
cried	1
Marianne,	1
throwing	1
her	1
arms	1
round	1
her,	1
and	1
looking	1
up	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
a	1
being	1
of	1
a	1
superior	1
order.	1
"Will	1
he	1
bleed	1
to	1
death?"	1
"No,	1
my	1
love!"	1
answered	1
a	1
sweet	1
voice:	1
"do	1
not	1
frighten	1
thyself."	1
"I've	1
done	1
bleeding,"	1
said	1
Frederick.	1
"Dear	1
me,	1
Miss	1
Marianne,	1
if	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
make	1
such	1
a	1
rout,"	1
cried	1
Mrs.	1
Tattle.	1
"Miss	1
Bertha,	1
it's	1
nothing	1
but	1
a	1
frolic.	1
You	1
see	1
Mr.	1
Frederick	1
Montague	1
only	1
in	1
a	1
masquerade	1
dress.	1
Nothing	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
but	1
a	1
frolic,	1
ma'am.	1
You	1
see	1
he's	1
stopped	1
bleeding.	1
I	1
was	1
frightened	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
wits	1
at	1
first.	1
I	1
thought	1
it	1
was	1
his	1
eye,	1
but	1
I	1
see	1
it's	1
only	1
his	1
nose.	1
All's	1
well	1
that	1
ends	1
well.	1
Mr.	1
Frederick,	1
we'll	1
keep	1
your	1
counsel.	1
Pray,	1
ma'am,	1
let	1
us	1
ask	1
no	1
questions;	1
it's	1
only	1
a	1
boyish	1
frolic.	1
Come,	1
Mr.	1
Frederick,	1
this	1
way,	1
into	1
my	1
room,	1
and	1
I'll	1
give	1
you	1
a	1
towel	1
and	1
some	1
clean	1
water,	1
and	1
you	1
can	1
get	1
rid	1
of	1
this	1
masquerade	1
dress.	1
Make	1
haste,	1
for	1
fear	1
your	1
father	1
and	1
mother	1
should	1
drop	1
in	1
upon	1
us."	1
"Do	1
not	1
be	1
afraid	1
of	1
thy	1
father	1
and	1
mother.	1
They	1
are	1
surely	1
thy	1
best	1
friends,"	1
said	1
a	1
voice.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
an	1
elderly	1
gentleman,	1
who	1
now	1
stood	1
behind	1
Frederick.	1
"Oh,	1
sir,	1
oh,	1
Mr.	1
Eden,"	1
said	1
Frederick,	1
turning	1
to	1
him.	1
"Don't	1
betray	1
me!	1
for	1
goodness'	1
sake!"	1
whispered	1
Mrs.	1
Tattle,	1
"say	1
nothing	1
about	1
me."	1
"I'm	1
not	1
thinking	1
about	1
you.	1
Let	1
me	1
speak,"	1
cried	1
he,	1
pushing	1
away	1
her	1
hand,	1
which	1
stopped	1
his	1
mouth.	1
"I	1
shall	1
say	1
nothing	1
about	1
you,	1
I	1
promise	1
you,"	1
said	1
Frederick,	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
contempt.	1
"No,	1
but	1
for	1
your	1
own	1
sake,	1
my	1
dear	1
sir,	1
your	1
papa	1
and	1
mamma.	1
Bless	1
me!	1
is	1
not	1
that	1
Mrs.	1
Montague's	1
carriage?"	1
"My	1
brother,	1
ma'am,"	1
said	1
Sophy,	1
"is	1
not	1
afraid	1
of	1
my	1
father	1
and	1
mother's	1
coming	1
back.	1
Let	1
him	1
speak;	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
speak	1
the	1
truth."	1
"To	1
be	1
sure,	1
Miss	1
Sophia,	1
I	1
wouldn't	1
hinder	1
him	1
from	1
speaking	1
the	1
truth;	1
but	1
it's	1
not	1
proper,	1
I	1
presume,	1
ma'am,	1
to	1
speak	1
truth	1
at	1
all	1
times,	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
places,	1
and	1
before	1
everybody,	1
servants	1
and	1
all.	1
I	1
only	1
wanted,	1
ma'am,	1
to	1
hinder	1
your	1
brother	1
from	1
exposing	1
himself.	1
A	1
hall,	1
I	1
apprehend,	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
proper	1
place	1
for	1
explanation."	1
"Here,"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Eden,	1
opening	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
his	1
room,	1
which	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
opposite	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
hall	1
to	1
Mrs.	1
Tattle's.	1
"Here	1
is	1
a	1
place,"	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
Frederick,	1
"where	1
thou	1
mayst	1
speak	1
the	1
truth	1
at	1
all	1
times,	1
and	1
before	1
everybody."	1
"Nay,	1
my	1
room's	1
at	1
Mr.	1
Frederick	1
Montague's	1
service,	1
and	1
my	1
door's	1
open	1
too.	1
This	1
way,	1
pray,"	1
said	1
she,	1
pulling	1
his	1
arm.	1
But	1
Frederick	1
broke	1
from	1
her,	1
and	1
followed	1
Mr.	1
Eden.	1
"Oh,	1
sir,	1
will	1
you	1
forgive	1
me?"	1
cried	1
he.	1
"Forgive	1
thee!--and	1
what	1
have	1
I	1
to	1
forgive!"	1
"Forgive,	1
brother,	1
without	1
asking	1
what,"	1
said	1
Bertha,	1
smiling.	1
"He	1
shall	1
know	1
all!"	1
cried	1
Frederick;	1
"all	1
that	1
concerns	1
myself,	1
I	1
mean.	1
Sir,	1
I	1
disguised	1
myself	1
in	1
this	1
dress;	1
I	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
your	1
room	1
to-night	1
on	1
purpose	1
to	1
see	1
you,	1
without	1
your	1
knowing	1
it,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
mimic	1
you.	1
The	1
chimney-sweeper,	1
where	1
is	1
he?"	1
said	1
Frederick,	1
looking	1
round;	1
and	1
he	1
ran	1
into	1
the	1
hall	1
to	1
see	1
for	1
him.	1
"May	1
he	1
come	1
in?	1
he	1
may--he	1
is	1
a	1
brave,	1
an	1
honest,	1
good,	1
grateful	1
boy.	1
He	1
never	1
guessed	1
who	1
I	1
was.	1
After	1
we	1
left	1
you	1
we	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
kitchen	1
together,	1
and	1
there,	1
fool	1
as	1
I	1
was,	1
for	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
making	1
Mr.	1
Christopher	1
and	1
the	1
servants	1
laugh,	1
began	1
to	1
mimic	1
you.	1
This	1
boy	1
said	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
stand	1
by	1
and	1
hear	1
you	1
laughed	1
at;	1
that	1
you	1
had	1
saved	1
his	1
life;	1
that	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
ashamed	1
of	1
myself;	1
that	1
you	1
had	1
just	1
given	1
me	1
half	1
a	1
crown;	1
and	1
so	1
you	1
had;	1
but	1
I	1
went	1
on,	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
I'd	1
knock	1
him	1
down	1
if	1
he	1
said	1
another	1
word.	1
He	1
did;	1
I	1
gave	1
the	1
first	1
blow;	1
we	1
fought;	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
ground;	1
the	1
servants	1
pulled	1
me	1
up	1
again.	1
They	1
found	1
out,	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
how,	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
chimney-	1
sweeper.	1
The	1
rest	1
you	1
saw.	1
And	1
now	1
can	1
you	1
forgive	1
me,	1
sir?"	1
said	1
Frederick	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Eden,	1
seizing	1
hold	1
of	1
his	1
hand.	1
"The	1
other	1
hand,	1
friend,"	1
said	1
the	1
Quaker,	1
gently	1
withdrawing	1
his	1
right	1
hand,	1
which	1
everybody	1
now	1
observed	1
was	1
much	1
swelled,	1
and	1
putting	1
it	1
into	1
his	1
bosom	1
again.	1
"This,	1
and	1
welcome,"	1
offering	1
his	1
other	1
hand	1
to	1
Frederick,	1
and	1
shaking	1
his	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
"Oh,	1
that	1
other	1
hand!"	1
said	1
Frederick,	1
"that	1
was	1
hurt,	1
I	1
remember.	1
How	1
ill	1
I	1
have	1
behaved--extremely	1
ill!	1
But	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
lesson	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
never	1
forget	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
I	1
live.	1
I	1
hope	1
for	1
the	1
future	1
I	1
shall	1
behave	1
like	1
a	1
gentleman."	1
"And	1
like	1
a	1
man--and	1
like	1
a	1
good	1
man,	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
thou	1
wilt,"	1
said	1
the	1
good	1
Quaker,	1
shaking	1
Frederick's	1
hand	1
affectionately;	1
"or	1
I	1
am	1
much	1
mistaken,	1
friend,	1
in	1
that	1
black	1
countenance."	1
"You	1
are	1
not	1
mistaken,"	1
cried	1
Marianne.	1
"Frederick	1
will	1
never	1
be	1
persuaded	1
again	1
by	1
anybody	1
to	1
do	1
what	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
think	1
right:	1
and	1
now,	1
brother,	1
you	1
may	1
wash	1
your	1
black	1
countenance."	1
Just	1
when	1
Frederick	1
had	1
got	1
rid	1
of	1
half	1
his	1
black	1
countenance,	1
a	1
double	1
knock	1
was	1
heard	1
at	1
the	1
door.	1
It	1
was	1
Mr.	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Montague.	1
"What	1
will	1
you	1
do	1
now?"	1
whispered	1
Mrs.	1
Theresa	1
to	1
Frederick,	1
as	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
mother	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
room.	1
"A	1
chimney-sweeper	1
covered	1
with	1
blood!"	1
exclaimed	1
Mr.	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Montague.	1
"Father,	1
I	1
am	1
Frederick,"	1
said	1
he,	1
stepping	1
forward	1
towards	1
them,	1
as	1
they	1
stood	1
in	1
astonishment.	1
"Frederick!	1
my	1
son!"	1
"Yes,	1
mother,	1
I'm	1
not	1
hurt	1
half	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
I	1
deserve;	1
I'll	1
tell	1
you--"	1
"Nay,"	1
interrupted	1
Bertha,	1
"let	1
my	1
brother	1
tell	1
the	1
story	1
this	1
time.	1
Thou	1
hast	1
told	1
it	1
once,	1
and	1
told	1
it	1
well;	1
no	1
one	1
but	1
my	1
brother	1
could	1
tell	1
it	1
better."	1
"A	1
story	1
never	1
tells	1
so	1
well	1
the	1
second	1
time,	1
to	1
be	1
sure,"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Theresa;	1
"but	1
Mr.	1
Eden	1
will	1
certainly	1
make	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
it."	1
Without	1
taking	1
any	1
notice	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
Tattle,	1
or	1
her	1
apprehensive	1
looks,	1
Mr.	1
Eden	1
explained	1
all	1
he	1
knew	1
of	1
the	1
affair	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
words.	1
"Your	1
son,"	1
concluded	1
he,	1
"will	1
quickly	1
put	1
off	1
his	1
dirty	1
dress.	1
The	1
dress	1
hath	1
not	1
stained	1
the	1
mind;	1
that	1
is	1
fair	1
and	1
honourable.	1
When	1
he	1
found	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
wrong,	1
he	1
said	1
so;	1
nor	1
was	1
he	1
in	1
haste	1
to	1
conceal	1
his	1
adventure	1
from	1
his	1
father;	1
this	1
made	1
me	1
think	1
well	1
of	1
both	1
father	1
and	1
son.	1
I	1
speak	1
plainly,	1
friend,	1
for	1
that	1
is	1
best.	1
But	1
what	1
is	1
become	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
chimney-sweeper?	1
He	1
will	1
want	1
to	1
go	1
home,"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Eden,	1
turning	1
to	1
Mrs.	1
Theresa.	1
Without	1
making	1
any	1
reply,	1
she	1
hurried	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
possible,	1
and	1
returned	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
moments,	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
extreme	1
consternation.	1
"Here	1
is	1
a	1
catastrophe	1
indeed!	1
Now,	1
indeed,	1
Mr.	1
Frederick,	1
your	1
papa	1
and	1
mamma	1
have	1
reason	1
to	1
be	1
angry.	1
A	1
new	1
suit	1
of	1
clothes!--the	1
bare	1
faced	1
villain!	1
gone!	1
no	1
sign	1
of	1
them	1
in	1
my	1
closet,	1
or	1
anywhere.	1
The	1
door	1
was	1
locked;	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
gone	1
up	1
the	1
chimney,	1
out	1
upon	1
the	1
leads,	1
and	1
so	1
escaped;	1
but	1
Christopher	1
is	1
after	1
him.	1
I	1
protest,	1
Mrs.	1
Montague,	1
you	1
take	1
it	1
too	1
quietly.	1
The	1
wretch!--a	1
new	1
suit	1
of	1
clothes,	1
blue	1
coat	1
and	1
buff	1
waistcoat.	1
I	1
never	1
heard	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
thing!	1
I	1
declare,	1
Mr.	1
Montague,	1
you	1
are	1
vastly	1
good,	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
a	1
passion,"	1
added	1
Mrs.	1
Theresa.	1
"Madam,"	1
replied	1
Mr.	1
Montague,	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
much	1
civil	1
contempt,	1
"I	1
think	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
a	1
suit	1
of	1
clothes,	1
and	1
even	1
the	1
disgrace	1
that	1
my	1
son	1
has	1
been	1
brought	1
to	1
this	1
evening,	1
fortunate	1
circumstances	1
in	1
his	1
education.	1
He	1
will,	1
I	1
am	1
persuaded,	1
judge	1
and	1
act	1
for	1
himself	1
more	1
wisely	1
in	1
future.	1
Nor	1
will	1
he	1
be	1
tempted	1
to	1
offend	1
against	1
humanity,	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
being	1
called	1
'The	1
best	1
mimic	1
in	1
the	1
world.'"	1
THE	1
BARRING	1
OUT;	1
OR,	1
PARTY	1
SPIRIT.	1
"The	1
mother	1
of	1
mischief,"	1
says	1
an	1
old	1
proverb,	1
"is	1
no	1
bigger	1
than	1
a	1
midge's	1
wing."	1
At	1
Doctor	1
Middleton's	1
school,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
tall	1
dunce	1
of	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Fisher,	1
who	1
never	1
could	1
be	1
taught	1
how	1
to	1
look	1
out	1
a	1
word	1
in	1
the	1
dictionary.	1
He	1
used	1
to	1
torment	1
everybody	1
with--"Do	1
pray	1
help	1
me!	1
I	1
can't	1
make	1
out	1
this	1
one	1
word."	1
The	1
person	1
who	1
usually	1
helped	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
distress	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
clever,	1
good	1
natured	1
boy,	1
of	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
De	1
Grey,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
many	1
years	1
under	1
Dr.	1
Middleton's	1
care,	1
and	1
who,	1
by	1
his	1
abilities	1
and	1
good	1
conduct,	1
did	1
him	1
great	1
credit.	1
The	1
doctor	1
certainly	1
was	1
both	1
proud	1
and	1
fond	1
of	1
him;	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
well	1
beloved,	1
or	1
so	1
much	1
esteemed	1
by	1
his	1
companions,	1
that	1
nobody	1
had	1
ever	1
called	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
odious	1
name	1
of	1
favourite,	1
until	1
the	1
arrival	1
of	1
a	1
new	1
scholar	1
of	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Archer.	1
Till	1
Archer	1
came,	1
the	1
ideas	1
of	1
FAVOURITES	1
and	1
PARTIES	1
were	1
almost	1
unknown	1
at	1
Dr.	1
Middleton's;	1
but	1
he	1
brought	1
all	1
these	1
ideas	1
fresh	1
from	1
a	1
great	1
public	1
school,	1
at	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
educated--at	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
acquired	1
a	1
sufficient	1
quantity	1
of	1
Greek	1
and	1
Latin,	1
and	1
a	1
superabundant	1
quantity	1
of	1
party	1
spirit.	1
His	1
aim,	1
the	1
moment	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
new	1
school,	1
was	1
to	1
get	1
to	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
it,	1
or	1
at	1
least	1
to	1
form	1
the	1
strongest	1
party.	1
His	1
influence,	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
boy	1
of	1
considerable	1
abilities,	1
was	1
quickly	1
felt,	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
powerful	1
rival,	1
as	1
he	1
thought	1
proper	1
to	1
call	1
him,	1
in	1
De	1
Grey;	1
and,	1
with	1
HIM,	1
a	1
rival	1
was	1
always	1
an	1
enemy.	1
De	1
Grey,	1
so	1
far	1
from	1
giving	1
him	1
any	1
cause	1
of	1
hatred,	1
treated	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
degree	1
of	1
cordiality,	1
which	1
would	1
probably	1
have	1
had	1
an	1
effect	1
upon	1
Archer's	1
mind,	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
for	1
the	1
artifices	1
of	1
Fisher.	1
It	1
may	1
seem	1
surprising,	1
that	1
a	1
GREAT	1
DUNCE	1
should	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
work	1
upon	1
a	1
boy	1
like	1
an	1
Archer,	1
who	1
was	1
called	1
a	1
great	1
genius;	1
but	1
when	1
genius	1
is	1
joined	1
to	1
a	1
violent	1
temper,	1
instead	1
of	1
being	1
united	1
to	1
good	1
sense,	1
it	1
is	1
at	1
the	1
mercy	1
even	1
of	1
dunces.	1
Fisher	1
was	1
mortally	1
offended	1
one	1
morning	1
by	1
De	1
Grey's	1
refusing	1
to	1
translate	1
his	1
whole	1
lesson	1
for	1
him.	1
He	1
went	1
over	1
to	1
Archer,	1
who,	1
considering	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
partisan	1
deserting	1
from	1
the	1
enemy,	1
received	1
him	1
with	1
open	1
arms,	1
and	1
translated	1
his	1
whole	1
lesson	1
without	1
expressing	1
MUCH	1
contempt	1
for	1
his	1
stupidity.	1
From	1
this	1
moment	1
Fisher	1
forgot	1
all	1
De	1
Grey's	1
former	1
kindness,	1
and	1
considered	1
only	1
how	1
he	1
could	1
in	1
his	1
turn	1
mortify	1
the	1
person	1
whom	1
he	1
felt	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
much	1
his	1
superior.	1
De	1
Grey	1
and	1
Archer	1
were	1
now	1
reading	1
for	1
a	1
premium,	1
which	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
given	1
in	1
their	1
class.	1
Fisher	1
betted	1
on	1
Archer's	1
head,	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
sense	1
enough	1
to	1
despise	1
the	1
bet	1
of	1
a	1
blockhead.	1
On	1
the	1
contrary	1
he	1
suffered	1
him	1
to	1
excite	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
rivalship	1
in	1
its	1
utmost	1
fury	1
by	1
collecting	1
the	1
bets	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
school.	1
So	1
that	1
this	1
premium	1
now	1
became	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
the	1
greatest	1
consequence,	1
and	1
Archer,	1
instead	1
of	1
taking	1
the	1
means	1
to	1
secure	1
a	1
judgment	1
in	1
his	1
favour,	1
was	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
opinions	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
companions.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
prize	1
which	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
won	1
by	1
his	1
own	1
exertions;	1
but	1
he	1
suffered	1
himself	1
to	1
consider	1
it	1
as	1
an	1
affair	1
of	1
chance.	1
The	1
consequence	1
was,	1
that	1
he	1
trusted	1
to	1
chance--his	1
partisans	1
lost	1
their	1
wagers,	1
and	1
he	1
the	1
premium--and	1
his	1
temper.	1
"Mr.	1
Archer,"	1
said	1
Dr.	1
Middleton,	1
after	1
the	1
grand	1
affair	1
was	1
decided,	1
"you	1
have	1
done	1
all	1
that	1
genius	1
alone	1
could	1
do;	1
but	1
you,	1
De	1
Grey,	1
have	1
done	1
all	1
that	1
genius	1
and	1
industry	1
united	1
could	1
do."	1
"Well!"	1
cried	1
Archer,	1
with	1
affected	1
gaiety,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
doctor	1
had	1
left	1
the	1
room--"Well,	1
I'm	1
content	1
with	1
MY	1
sentence.	1
Genius	1
alone!	1
for	1
me--industry	1
for	1
those	1
who	1
WANT	1
it,"	1
added	1
he,	1
with	1
a	1
significant	1
look	1
at	1
De	1
Grey.	1
Fisher	1
applauded	1
this	1
as	1
a	1
very	1
spirited	1
speech;	1
and,	1
by	1
insinuations	1
that	1
Dr.	1
Middleton	1
"always	1
gave	1
the	1
premium	1
to	1
De	1
Grey,"	1
and	1
that	1
"those	1
who	1
had	1
lost	1
their	1
bets	1
might	1
thank	1
themselves	1
for	1
it,	1
for	1
being	1
such	1
simpletons	1
as	1
to	1
bet	1
against	1
the	1
favourite,"	1
he	1
raised	1
a	1
murmur	1
highly	1
flattering	1
to	1
Archer,	1
amongst	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
credulous	1
boys;	1
whilst	1
others	1
loudly	1
proclaimed	1
their	1
belief	1
in	1
Dr.	1
Middleton's	1
impartiality.	1
These	1
warmly	1
congratulated	1
De	1
Grey.	1
At	1
this	1
Archer	1
grew	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
angry,	1
and	1
when	1
Fisher	1
was	1
proceeding	1
to	1
speak	1
nonsense	1
FOR	1
him,	1
pushed	1
forward	1
into	1
the	1
circle	1
to	1
De	1
Grey,	1
crying,	1
"I	1
wish,	1
Mr.	1
Fisher,	1
you	1
would	1
let	1
me	1
fight	1
my	1
own	1
battles!"	1
"And	1
_I_	1
wish,"	1
said	1
young	1
Townsend,	1
who	1
was	1
fonder	1
of	1
diversions	1
than	1
of	1
premiums,	1
or	1
battles,	1
or	1
of	1
anything	1
else--"_I_	1
wish,	1
that	1
we	1
were	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
any	1
battles;	1
after	1
having	1
worked	1
like	1
horses,	1
don't	1
set	1
about	1
to	1
fight	1
like	1
dogs.	1
Come,"	1
said	1
he,	1
tapping	1
De	1
Grey's	1
shoulder,	1
"let	1
us	1
see	1
your	1
new	1
playhouse,	1
do--it's	1
a	1
holiday,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
make	1
the	1
most	1
of	1
it.	1
Let	1
us	1
have	1
the	1
'School	1
for	1
Scandal,'	1
do;	1
and	1
I'll	1
play	1
Charles	1
for	1
you,	1
and	1
you,	1
De	1
Grey,	1
shall	1
be	1
MY	1
LITTLE	1
PREMIUM.	1
Come,	1
do	1
open	1
this	1
new	1
playhouse	1
of	1
yours	1
to-night."	1
"Come	1
then!"	1
said	1
De	1
Grey,	1
and	1
he	1
ran	1
across	1
the	1
playground	1
to	1
a	1
waste	1
building	1
at	1
the	1
farthest	1
end	1
of	1
it,	1
in	1
which,	1
at	1
the	1
earnest	1
request	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
community,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
permission	1
of	1
Dr.	1
Middleton,	1
he	1
had	1
with	1
much	1
pain	1
and	1
ingenuity	1
erected	1
a	1
theatre.	1
"The	1
new	1
theatre	1
is	1
going	1
to	1
be	1
opened!	1
Follow	1
the	1
manager!	1
Follow	1
the	1
manager!"	1
echoed	1
a	1
multitude	1
of	1
voices.	1
"FOLLOW	1
THE	1
MANAGER!"	1
echoed	1
very	1
disagreeably	1
in	1
Archer's	1
ear;	1
but	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
LEFT	1
ALONE,	1
he	1
was	1
also	1
obliged	1
to	1
follow	1
the	1
manager.	1
The	1
moment	1
that	1
the	1
door	1
was	1
unlocked,	1
the	1
crowd	1
rushed	1
in:	1
the	1
delight	1
and	1
wonder	1
expressed	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
was	1
great,	1
and	1
the	1
applause	1
and	1
thanks	1
which	1
were	1
bestowed	1
upon	1
the	1
manager	1
were	1
long	1
and	1
loud.	1
Archer	1
at	1
least	1
thought	1
them	1
long,	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
impatient	1
till	1
his	1
voice	1
could	1
be	1
heard.	1
When	1
at	1
length	1
the	1
acclamations	1
had	1
spent	1
themselves,	1
he	1
walked	1
across	1
the	1
stage	1
with	1
a	1
knowing	1
air,	1
and	1
looking	1
round	1
contemptuously.	1
"And	1
is	1
THIS	1
your	1
famous	1
playhouse?"	1
cried	1
he.	1
"I	1
wish	1
you	1
had,	1
any	1
of	1
you,	1
seen	1
the	1
playhouse	1
_I_	1
have	1
been	1
used	1
to?"	1
These	1
words	1
made	1
a	1
great	1
and	1
visible	1
change	1
in	1
the	1
feelings	1
and	1
opinions	1
of	1
the	1
public.	1
"Who	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
servant	1
of	1
the	1
public?	1
or	1
who	1
would	1
toil	1
for	1
popular	1
applause?"	1
A	1
few	1
words	1
spoken	1
in	1
a	1
decisive	1
tone	1
by	1
a	1
new	1
voice	1
operated	1
as	1
a	1
charm,	1
and	1
the	1
playhouse	1
was	1
in	1
an	1
instant	1
metamorphosed	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
spectators.	1
All	1
gratitude	1
for	1
the	1
past	1
was	1
forgotten,	1
and	1
the	1
expectation	1
of	1
something	1
better	1
justified	1
to	1
the	1
capricious	1
multitude	1
their	1
disdain	1
of	1
what	1
they	1
had	1
so	1
lately	1
pronounced	1
to	1
be	1
excellent.	1
Everyone	1
now	1
began	1
to	1
criticise.	1
One	1
observed,	1
"that	1
the	1
green	1
curtain	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
holes,	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
draw	1
up."	1
Another	1
attacked	1
the	1
scenes;	1
"Scenes!	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
like	1
real	1
scenes--Archer	1
must	1
know	1
best,	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
used	1
to	1
these	1
things."	1
So	1
everybody	1
crowded	1
to	1
hear	1
something	1
of	1
the	1
OTHER	1
playhouse.	1
They	1
gathered	1
round	1
Archer	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
description	1
of	1
his	1
playhouse,	1
and	1
at	1
every	1
sentence	1
insulting	1
comparisons	1
were	1
made.	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
done,	1
his	1
auditors	1
looked	1
round,	1
sighed	1
and	1
wished	1
that	1
Archer	1
had	1
been	1
their	1
manager.	1
They	1
turned	1
from	1
De	1
Grey	1
as	1
from	1
a	1
person	1
who	1
had	1
done	1
them	1
an	1
injury.	1
Some	1
of	1
his	1
friends--for	1
he	1
had	1
friends	1
who	1
were	1
not	1
swayed	1
by	1
the	1
popular	1
opinion--felt	1
indignation	1
at	1
this	1
ingratitude,	1
and	1
were	1
going	1
to	1
express	1
their	1
feelings;	1
but	1
De	1
Grey	1
stopped	1
them,	1
and	1
begged	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
speak	1
for	1
himself.	1
"Gentlemen,"	1
said	1
he,	1
coming	1
forward,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
sufficient	1
command	1
of	1
himself.	1
"My	1
friends,	1
I	1
see	1
you	1
are	1
discontented	1
with	1
me	1
and	1
my	1
playhouse.	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
my	1
best	1
to	1
please	1
you;	1
but	1
if	1
anybody	1
else	1
can	1
please	1
you	1
better,	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
glad	1
of	1
it.	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
work	1
so	1
hard	1
for	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
being	1
your	1
manager.	1
You	1
have	1
my	1
free	1
leave	1
to	1
tear	1
down--"	1
Here	1
his	1
voice	1
faltered,	1
but	1
he	1
hurried	1
on--"You	1
have	1
my	1
free	1
leave	1
to	1
tear	1
down	1
all	1
my	1
work	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
you	1
please.	1
Archer,	1
shake	1
hands	1
first,	1
however,	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
there's	1
no	1
malice	1
in	1
the	1
case."	1
Archer,	1
who	1
was	1
touched	1
by	1
what	1
his	1
rival	1
said,	1
and,	1
stopping	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
his	1
new	1
partisan,	1
Fisher,	1
cried,	1
"No,	1
Fisher!	1
no!--no	1
pulling	1
down.	1
We	1
can	1
alter	1
it.	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
ingenuity	1
in	1
it,	1
considering."	1
In	1
vain	1
Archer	1
would	1
now	1
have	1
recalled	1
the	1
public	1
to	1
reason,--the	1
time	1
for	1
reason	1
was	1
passed:	1
enthusiasm	1
had	1
taken	1
hold	1
of	1
their	1
minds.	1
"Down	1
with	1
it!	1
Down	1
with	1
it!	1
Archer	1
for	1
ever!"	1
cried	1
Fisher,	1
and	1
tore	1
down	1
the	1
curtain.	1
The	1
riot	1
once	1
begun,	1
nothing	1
could	1
stop	1
the	1
little	1
mob,	1
till	1
the	1
whole	1
theatre	1
was	1
demolished.	1
The	1
love	1
of	1
power	1
prevailed	1
in	1
the	1
mind	1
of	1
Archer;	1
he	1
was	1
secretly	1
flattered	1
by	1
the	1
zeal	1
of	1
his	1
PARTY,	1
and	1
he	1
mistook	1
their	1
love	1
of	1
mischief	1
for	1
attachment	1
to	1
himself.	1
De	1
Grey	1
looked	1
on	1
superior.	1
"I	1
said	1
I	1
could	1
bear	1
to	1
see	1
all	1
this,	1
and	1
I	1
can,"	1
said	1
he;	1
"now	1
it	1
is	1
all	1
over."	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
over,	1
there	1
was	1
silence.	1
The	1
rioters	1
stood	1
still	1
to	1
take	1
breath,	1
and	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
what	1
they	1
had	1
done.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
blank	1
space	1
before	1
them.	1
In	1
this	1
moment	1
of	1
silence	1
there	1
was	1
heard	1
something	1
like	1
a	1
voice.	1
"Hush!	1
What	1
strange	1
voice	1
is	1
that?"	1
said	1
Archer.	1
Fisher	1
caught	1
fast	1
hold	1
of	1
his	1
arm.	1
Everybody	1
looked	1
round	1
to	1
see	1
where	1
the	1
voice	1
came	1
from.	1
It	1
was	1
dusk.	1
Two	1
window-shutters	1
at	1
the	1
farthest	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
building	1
were	1
seen	1
to	1
move	1
slowly	1
inwards.	1
De	1
Grey,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
instant	1
Archer,	1
went	1
forward;	1
and,	1
as	1
the	1
shutters	1
opened,	1
there	1
appeared	1
through	1
the	1
hole	1
the	1
dark	1
face	1
and	1
shrivelled	1
hands	1
of	1
a	1
very	1
old	1
gipsy.	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
speak;	1
but	1
she	1
looked	1
first	1
at	1
one	1
and	1
then	1
at	1
another.	1
At	1
length	1
she	1
fixed	1
her	1
eyes	1
on	1
De	1
Grey.	1
"Well,	1
woman,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"what	1
do	1
you	1
want	1
with	1
me?"	1
"Want!--nothing--with	1
YOU,"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
woman;	1
"do	1
you	1
want	1
nothing	1
with	1
ME?"	1
"Nothing,"	1
said	1
De	1
Grey.	1
Her	1
eye	1
immediately	1
turned	1
upon	1
Archer,--"YOU	1
want	1
something	1
with	1
me,"	1
said	1
she,	1
with	1
emphasis.	1
"I--what	1
do	1
I	1
want?"	1
replied	1
Archer.	1
"No,"	1
said	1
she,	1
changing	1
her	1
tone,	1
"you	1
want	1
nothing--nothing	1
will	1
you	1
ever	1
want,	1
or	1
I	1
am	1
much	1
mistaken	1
in	1
that	1
FACE."	1
In	1
that	1
WATCH-CHAIN,	1
she	1
should	1
have	1
said,	1
for	1
her	1
quick	1
eye	1
had	1
espied	1
Archer's	1
watch-chain.	1
He	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
person	1
in	1
the	1
company	1
who	1
had	1
a	1
watch,	1
and	1
she	1
therefore	1
judged	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
richest.	1
"Had	1
you	1
ever	1
your	1
fortune	1
told,	1
sir,	1
in	1
your	1
life?"	1
"Not	1
I!"	1
said	1
he,	1
looking	1
at	1
De	1
Grey,	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
his	1
ridicule,	1
if	1
he	1
listened	1
to	1
the	1
gipsy.	1
"Not	1
you!	1
No!	1
for	1
you	1
will	1
make	1
your	1
own	1
fortune,	1
and	1
the	1
fortune	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
belong	1
to	1
you!"	1
"There's	1
good	1
news	1
for	1
my	1
friends!"	1
cried	1
Archer.	1
"And	1
I'm	1
one	1
of	1
them,	1
remember	1
that,"	1
cried	1
Fisher.	1
"And	1
I,"	1
"And	1
I,"	1
joined	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
voices.	1
"Good	1
luck	1
to	1
them!"	1
cried	1
the	1
gipsy,	1
"good	1
luck	1
to	1
them	1
all!"	1
Then,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
acquired	1
sufficient	1
confidence	1
in	1
her	1
good	1
will,	1
they	1
pressed	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
window.	1
"There,"	1
cried	1
Townsend,	1
as	1
he	1
chanced	1
to	1
stumble	1
over	1
the	1
carpenter's	1
mitre	1
box,	1
which	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
way,	1
"there's	1
a	1
good	1
omen	1
for	1
me.	1
I've	1
stumbled	1
on	1
the	1
mitre	1
box;	1
I	1
shall	1
certainly	1
be	1
a	1
bishop."	1
Happy	1
he	1
who	1
had	1
sixpence,	1
for	1
he	1
bid	1
fair	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
judge	1
upon	1
the	1
bench.	1
And	1
happier	1
he	1
who	1
had	1
a	1
shilling,	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
high	1
road	1
to	1
be	1
one	1
day	1
upon	1
the	1
woolsack,	1
Lord	1
High	1
Chancellor	1
of	1
England.	1
No	1
one	1
had	1
half	1
a	1
crown,	1
or	1
no	1
one	1
would	1
surely	1
have	1
kept	1
it	1
in	1
his	1
pocket	1
upon	1
such	1
an	1
occasion,	1
for	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
an	1
archbishop,	1
a	1
king,	1
or	1
what	1
he	1
pleased.	1
Fisher,	1
who	1
like	1
all	1
weak	1
people	1
was	1
extremely	1
credulous,	1
kept	1
his	1
post	1
immovable	1
in	1
the	1
front	1
row	1
all	1
the	1
time,	1
his	1
mouth	1
open,	1
and	1
his	1
stupid	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
upon	1
the	1
gipsy,	1
in	1
whom	1
he	1
felt	1
implicit	1
faith.	1
Those	1
who	1
have	1
least	1
confidence	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
powers,	1
and	1
who	1
have	1
least	1
expectation	1
from	1
the	1
success	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
exertions,	1
are	1
always	1
most	1
disposed	1
to	1
trust	1
in	1
fortune-tellers	1
and	1
fortune.	1
They	1
hope	1
to	1
WIN,	1
when	1
they	1
cannot	1
EARN;	1
and	1
as	1
they	1
can	1
never	1
be	1
convinced	1
by	1
those	1
who	1
speak	1
sense,	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
wonder	1
they	1
are	1
always	1
persuaded	1
by	1
those	1
who	1
talk	1
nonsense.	1
"I	1
have	1
a	1
question	1
to	1
put,"	1
said	1
Fisher,	1
in	1
a	1
solemn	1
tone.	1
"Put	1
it,	1
then,"	1
said	1
Archer,	1
"what	1
hinders	1
you?"	1
"But	1
they	1
will	1
hear	1
me,"	1
said	1
he,	1
looking	1
suspiciously	1
at	1
De	1
Grey.	1
"_I_	1
shall	1
not	1
hear	1
you,"	1
said	1
De	1
Grey,	1
"I	1
am	1
going."	1
Everybody	1
else	1
drew	1
back,	1
and	1
left	1
him	1
to	1
whisper	1
his	1
question	1
in	1
the	1
gipsy's	1
ear.	1
"What	1
is	1
become	1
of	1
my	1
Livy?"	1
"Your	1
SISTER	1
Livy,	1
do	1
you	1
mean?"	1
said	1
the	1
gipsy.	1
"No,	1
my	1
LATIN	1
Livy."	1
The	1
gipsy	1
paused	1
for	1
information.	1
"It	1
had	1
a	1
leaf	1
torn	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
beginning,	1
and	1
I	1
HATE	1
DR.	1
MIDDLETON--"	1
"Written	1
in	1
it,"	1
interrupted	1
the	1
gipsy.	1
"Right--the	1
very	1
book!"	1
cried	1
Fisher	1
with	1
joy.	1
"But	1
how	1
COULD	1
you	1
know	1
it	1
was	1
Dr.	1
Middleton's	1
name?	1
I	1
thought	1
I	1
had	1
scratched	1
it,	1
so	1
that	1
nobody	1
could	1
make	1
it	1
out."	1
"Nobody	1
COULD	1
make	1
it	1
out	1
but	1
ME,"	1
replied	1
the	1
gipsy.	1
"But	1
never	1
think	1
to	1
deceive	1
me,"	1
said	1
she,	1
shaking	1
her	1
head	1
at	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
manner	1
that	1
made	1
him	1
tremble.	1
"I	1
don't	1
deceive	1
you	1
indeed,	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
the	1
whole	1
truth.	1
I	1
lost	1
it	1
a	1
week	1
ago."	1
"True."	1
"And	1
when	1
shall	1
I	1
find	1
it?"	1
"Meet	1
me	1
here	1
at	1
this	1
hour	1
to-morrow	1
evening,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
answer	1
you.	1
No	1
more!	1
I	1
must	1
be	1
gone.	1
Not	1
a	1
word	1
more	1
to-night."	1
She	1
pulled	1
the	1
shutters	1
towards	1
her,	1
and	1
left	1
the	1
youth	1
in	1
darkness.	1
All	1
his	1
companions	1
were	1
gone.	1
He	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
deeply	1
engaged	1
in	1
this	1
conference,	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
perceived	1
their	1
departure.	1
He	1
found	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
at	1
supper,	1
but	1
no	1
entreaties	1
could	1
prevail	1
upon	1
him	1
to	1
disclose	1
his	1
secret.	1
Townsend	1
rallied	1
in	1
vain.	1
As	1
for	1
Archer,	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
disposed	1
to	1
destroy	1
by	1
ridicule	1
the	1
effect	1
which	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
old	1
woman's	1
predictions	1
in	1
his	1
favour	1
had	1
had	1
upon	1
the	1
imagination	1
of	1
many	1
of	1
his	1
little	1
partisans.	1
He	1
had	1
privately	1
slipped	1
two	1
good	1
shillings	1
into	1
the	1
gipsy's	1
hand	1
to	1
secure	1
her;	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
willing	1
to	1
pay	1
any	1
price	1
for	1
ANY	1
means	1
of	1
acquiring	1
power.	1
The	1
watch-chain	1
had	1
not	1
deceived	1
the	1
gipsy,	1
for	1
Archer	1
was	1
the	1
richest	1
person	1
in	1
the	1
community.	1
His	1
friends	1
had	1
imprudently	1
supplied	1
him	1
with	1
more	1
money	1
than	1
is	1
usually	1
trusted	1
to	1
boys	1
of	1
his	1
age.	1
Dr.	1
Middleton	1
had	1
refused	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
a	1
larger	1
monthly	1
allowance	1
than	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
his	1
companions;	1
but	1
he	1
brought	1
to	1
school	1
with	1
him	1
secretly	1
the	1
sum	1
of	1
five	1
guineas.	1
This	1
appeared	1
to	1
his	1
friends	1
and	1
to	1
himself	1
an	1
inexhaustible	1
treasure.	1
Riches	1
and	1
talents	1
would,	1
he	1
flattered	1
himself,	1
secure	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
ascendancy	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
ambitious.	1
"Am	1
I	1
your	1
manager,	1
or	1
not?"	1
was	1
now	1
his	1
question.	1
"I	1
scorn	1
to	1
take	1
advantage	1
of	1
a	1
hasty	1
moment;	1
but	1
since	1
last	1
night	1
you	1
have	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
consider.	1
If	1
you	1
desire	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
your	1
manager,	1
you	1
shall	1
see	1
what	1
a	1
theatre	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
for	1
you.	1
In	1
this	1
purse,"	1
said	1
he,	1
showing	1
through	1
the	1
network	1
a	1
glimpse	1
of	1
the	1
shining	1
treasure--"in	1
this	1
purse	1
is	1
Aladdin's	1
wonderful	1
lamp.	1
Am	1
I	1
your	1
manager?	1
Put	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
vote."	1
It	1
was	1
put	1
to	1
the	1
vote.	1
About	1
ten	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
reasonable	1
of	1
the	1
assembly	1
declared	1
their	1
gratitude	1
and	1
high	1
approbation	1
of	1
their	1
old	1
friend,	1
De	1
Grey;	1
but	1
the	1
numbers	1
were	1
in	1
favour	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
friend.	1
And	1
as	1
no	1
metaphysical	1
distinctions	1
relative	1
to	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
a	1
majority	1
had	1
ever	1
entered	1
their	1
thoughts,	1
the	1
most	1
numerous	1
party	1
considered	1
themselves	1
as	1
now	1
beyond	1
dispute	1
in	1
the	1
right.	1
They	1
drew	1
off	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
in	1
triumph,	1
and	1
their	1
leader,	1
who	1
knew	1
the	1
consequence	1
of	1
a	1
name	1
in	1
party	1
matters,	1
immediately	1
distinguished	1
his	1
partisans	1
by	1
the	1
gallant	1
name	1
of	1
ARCHERS,	1
stigmatizing	1
the	1
friends	1
of	1
De	1
Grey	1
by	1
the	1
odious	1
epithet	1
of	1
Greybeards.	1
Amongst	1
the	1
Archers	1
was	1
a	1
class	1
not	1
very	1
remarkable	1
for	1
their	1
mental	1
qualifications;	1
but	1
who,	1
by	1
their	1
bodily	1
activity,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
peculiar	1
advantages	1
annexed	1
to	1
their	1
way	1
of	1
life,	1
rendered	1
themselves	1
of	1
the	1
highest	1
consequence,	1
especially	1
to	1
the	1
rich	1
and	1
enterprising.	1
The	1
judicious	1
reader	1
will	1
apprehend	1
that	1
I	1
allude	1
to	1
the	1
persons	1
called	1
day	1
scholars.	1
Amongst	1
these,	1
Fisher	1
was	1
distinguished	1
by	1
his	1
knowledge	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
streets	1
and	1
shops	1
in	1
the	1
adjacent	1
town;	1
and,	1
though	1
a	1
dull	1
scholar,	1
he	1
had	1
such	1
reputation	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
business,	1
that	1
whoever	1
had	1
commissions	1
to	1
execute	1
at	1
the	1
confectioner's,	1
was	1
sure	1
to	1
apply	1
to	1
him.	1
Some	1
of	1
the	1
youngest	1
of	1
his	1
employers	1
had,	1
it	1
is	1
true,	1
at	1
times	1
complained	1
that	1
he	1
made	1
mistakes	1
of	1
halfpence	1
and	1
pence	1
in	1
their	1
accounts;	1
but	1
as	1
these	1
affairs	1
could	1
never	1
be	1
brought	1
to	1
a	1
public	1
trial,	1
Fisher's	1
character	1
and	1
consequence	1
were	1
undiminished,	1
till	1
the	1
fatal	1
day	1
when	1
his	1
Aunt	1
Barbara	1
forbade	1
his	1
visits	1
to	1
the	1
confectioner's;	1
or,	1
rather,	1
till	1
she	1
requested	1
the	1
confectioner,	1
who	1
had	1
his	1
private	1
reasons	1
for	1
obeying	1
her,	1
not	1
TO	1
RECEIVE	1
her	1
nephew's	1
visits,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
himself	1
sick	1
at	1
his	1
house,	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Barbara's	1
fears	1
for	1
his	1
health	1
were	1
incessant.	1
Though	1
his	1
visits	1
to	1
the	1
confectioner's	1
were	1
thus	1
at	1
an	1
end,	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
other	1
shops	1
open	1
to	1
him;	1
and	1
with	1
officious	1
zeal	1
he	1
offered	1
his	1
services	1
to	1
the	1
new	1
manager,	1
to	1
purchase	1
whatever	1
might	1
be	1
wanting	1
for	1
the	1
theatre.	1
Since	1
his	1
father's	1
death	1
Fisher	1
had	1
become	1
a	1
boarder	1
at	1
Dr.	1
Middleton's,	1
but	1
his	1
frequent	1
visits	1
to	1
his	1
Aunt	1
Barbara	1
afforded	1
him	1
opportunities	1
of	1
going	1
into	1
the	1
town.	1
The	1
carpenter,	1
De	1
Grey's	1
friend,	1
was	1
discarded	1
by	1
Archer,	1
for	1
having	1
said	1
"LACK-A-DAISY!"	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
old	1
theatre	1
was	1
pulled	1
down.	1
A	1
new	1
carpenter	1
and	1
paper	1
hanger,	1
recommended	1
by	1
Fisher,	1
were	1
appointed	1
to	1
attend,	1
with	1
their	1
tools,	1
for	1
orders,	1
at	1
two	1
o'clock.	1
Archer,	1
impatient	1
to	1
show	1
his	1
ingenuity	1
and	1
his	1
generosity,	1
gave	1
his	1
plan	1
and	1
his	1
orders	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
minutes,	1
in	1
a	1
most	1
decided	1
manner;	1
"These	1
things,"	1
he	1
observed,	1
"should	1
be	1
done	1
with	1
some	1
spirit."	1
To	1
which	1
the	1
carpenter	1
readily	1
assented,	1
and	1
added,	1
that	1
"gentlemen	1
of	1
spirit	1
never	1
looked	1
to	1
the	1
EXPENSE,	1
but	1
always	1
to	1
the	1
EFFECT."	1
Upon	1
this	1
principle	1
Mr.	1
Chip	1
set	1
to	1
work	1
with	1
all	1
possible	1
alacrity.	1
In	1
a	1
few	1
hours'	1
time	1
he	1
promised	1
to	1
produce	1
a	1
grand	1
effect.	1
High	1
expectations	1
were	1
formed.	1
Nothing	1
was	1
talked	1
of	1
but	1
the	1
new	1
playhouse;	1
and	1
so	1
intent	1
upon	1
it	1
was	1
every	1
head,	1
that	1
no	1
lessons	1
could	1
be	1
got.	1
Archer	1
was	1
obliged,	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
his	1
various	1
occupations,	1
to	1
perform	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
grammar	1
and	1
dictionary	1
for	1
twenty	1
different	1
people.	1
"O	1
ye	1
Athenians!"	1
he	1
exclaimed,	1
"how	1
hard	1
do	1
I	1
work	1
to	1
obtain	1
your	1
praise!"	1
Impatient	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
theatre,	1
the	1
moment	1
the	1
hours	1
destined	1
for	1
instruction,	1
or,	1
as	1
they	1
are	1
termed	1
by	1
schoolboys,	1
school-hours,	1
were	1
over,	1
each	1
prisoner	1
started	1
up	1
with	1
a	1
shout	1
of	1
joy.	1
"Stop	1
one	1
moment,	1
gentlemen,	1
if	1
you	1
please,"	1
said	1
Dr.	1
Middleton,	1
in	1
an	1
awful	1
voice.	1
"Mr.	1
Archer,	1
return	1
to	1
your	1
place.	1
Are	1
you	1
all	1
here?"	1
The	1
names	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
boys	1
were	1
called	1
over,	1
and	1
when	1
each	1
had	1
answered	1
to	1
his	1
name,	1
Dr.	1
Middleton	1
said--	1
"Gentlemen,	1
I	1
am	1
sorry	1
to	1
interrupt	1
your	1
amusements;	1
but,	1
till	1
you	1
have	1
contrary	1
orders	1
from	1
me,	1
no	1
one,	1
on	1
pain	1
of	1
my	1
serious	1
displeasure,	1
must	1
go	1
into	1
THAT	1
building"	1
(pointing	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
the	1
theatre	1
was	1
erecting).	1
"Mr.	1
Archer,	1
your	1
carpenter	1
is	1
at	1
the	1
door.	1
You	1
will	1
be	1
so	1
good	1
as	1
to	1
dismiss	1
him.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
proper	1
to	1
give	1
my	1
reasons	1
for	1
these	1
orders;	1
but	1
you	1
who	1
KNOW	1
me,"	1
said	1
the	1
doctor,	1
and	1
his	1
eye	1
turned	1
towards	1
De	1
Grey,	1
"will	1
not	1
suspect	1
me	1
of	1
caprice.	1
I	1
depend,	1
gentlemen,	1
upon	1
your	1
obedience."	1
To	1
the	1
dead	1
silence	1
with	1
which	1
these	1
orders	1
were	1
received,	1
succeeded	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
a	1
universal	1
groan.	1
"So!"	1
said	1
Townsend,	1
"all	1
our	1
diversion	1
is	1
over."	1
"So,"	1
whispered	1
Fisher	1
in	1
the	1
manager's	1
ear,	1
"this	1
is	1
some	1
trick	1
of	1
the	1
Greybeard's.	1
Did	1
you	1
not	1
observe	1
how	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
De	1
Grey?"	1
Fired	1
by	1
this	1
thought,	1
which	1
had	1
never	1
entered	1
his	1
mind	1
before,	1
Archer	1
started	1
from	1
his	1
reverie,	1
and	1
striking	1
his	1
hand	1
upon	1
the	1
table,	1
swore	1
that	1
he	1
"would	1
not	1
be	1
outwitted	1
by	1
any	1
Greybeard	1
in	1
Europe--no,	1
nor	1
by	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
put	1
together.	1
The	1
Archers	1
were	1
surely	1
a	1
match	1
for	1
them.	1
He	1
would	1
stand	1
by	1
them,	1
if	1
they	1
would	1
stand	1
by	1
him,"	1
he	1
declared,	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
"against	1
the	1
whole	1
world,	1
and	1
Dr.	1
Middleton	1
himself,	1
with	1
'LITTLE	1
PREMIUMS'	1
at	1
his	1
right	1
hand."	1
Everybody	1
admired	1
Archer's	1
spirit,	1
but	1
were	1
a	1
little	1
appalled	1
at	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
standing	1
against	1
Dr.	1
Middleton.	1
"Why	1
not?"	1
resumed	1
the	1
indignant	1
manager.	1
"Neither	1
Dr.	1
Middleton	1
nor	1
any	1
doctor	1
upon	1
earth	1
shall	1
treat	1
me	1
with	1
injustice.	1
This,	1
you	1
see,	1
is	1
a	1
stroke	1
at	1
me	1
and	1
my	1
party,	1
and	1
I	1
won't	1
bear	1
it."	1
"Oh,	1
you	1
are	1
mistaken!"	1
said	1
De	1
Grey,	1
who	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
one	1
who	1
dared	1
to	1
oppose	1
reason	1
to	1
the	1
angry	1
orator.	1
"It	1
cannot	1
be	1
a	1
stroke	1
aimed	1
at	1
'you	1
and	1
your	1
party,'	1
for	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
know	1
that	1
you	1
HAVE	1
a	1
party."	1
"I'll	1
make	1
him	1
know	1
it,	1
and	1
I'll	1
make	1
YOU	1
know	1
it,	1
too,"	1
said	1
Archer.	1
"Before	1
I	1
came	1
here	1
you	1
reigned	1
alone,	1
now	1
your	1
reign	1
is	1
over,	1
Mr.	1
De	1
Grey.	1
Remember	1
my	1
majority	1
this	1
morning,	1
and	1
your	1
theatre	1
last	1
night."	1
"He	1
has	1
remembered	1
it,"	1
said	1
Fisher.	1
"You	1
see,	1
the	1
moment	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
our	1
manager,	1
we	1
were	1
to	1
have	1
no	1
theatre,	1
no	1
playhouse,	1
no	1
plays.	1
We	1
must	1
all	1
sit	1
down	1
with	1
our	1
hands	1
before	1
us--all	1
for	1
'GOOD	1
REASONS'	1
of	1
Dr.	1
Middleton's,	1
which	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
vouchsafe	1
to	1
tell	1
us."	1
"I	1
won't	1
be	1
governed	1
by	1
any	1
man's	1
reasons	1
that	1
he	1
won't	1
tell	1
me,"	1
cried	1
Archer.	1
"He	1
cannot	1
have	1
good	1
reasons,	1
or	1
why	1
not	1
tell	1
them?"	1
"Nonsense!"	1
said	1
De	1
Grey.	1
"WE	1
SHALL	1
NOT	1
SUSPECT	1
HIM	1
OF	1
CAPRICE!"	1
"Why	1
not?"	1
"Because	1
we	1
who	1
know	1
him,	1
have	1
never	1
known	1
him	1
capricious."	1
"Perhaps	1
not.	1
_I_	1
know	1
nothing	1
about	1
him,"	1
said	1
Archer.	1
"No,"	1
said	1
De	1
Grey;	1
"for	1
that	1
very	1
reason	1
_I_	1
speak	1
who	1
do	1
know	1
him.	1
Don't	1
be	1
in	1
a	1
passion,	1
Archer."	1
"I	1
will	1
be	1
in	1
a	1
passion.	1
I	1
won't	1
submit	1
to	1
tyranny.	1
I	1
won't	1
be	1
made	1
a	1
fool	1
of	1
by	1
a	1
few	1
soft	1
words.	1
You	1
don't	1
know	1
me,	1
De	1
Grey.	1
I'll	1
go	1
through	1
with	1
what	1
I've	1
begun.	1
I	1
am	1
manager,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
manager;	1
and	1
you	1
shall	1
see	1
my	1
theatre	1
finished	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
you,	1
and	1
MY	1
party	1
triumphant."	1
"Party,"	1
repeated	1
De	1
Grey.	1
"I	1
cannot	1
imagine	1
what	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
word	1
'party'	1
that	1
seems	1
to	1
drive	1
you	1
mad.	1
We	1
never	1
heard	1
of	1
parties	1
till	1
you	1
came	1
amongst	1
us."	1
"No;	1
before	1
I	1
came,	1
I	1
say,	1
nobody	1
dared	1
oppose	1
you;	1
but	1
I	1
dare;	1
and	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
to	1
your	1
face,	1
take	1
care	1
of	1
me--a	1
warm	1
friend	1
and	1
a	1
bitter	1
enemy	1
is	1
my	1
motto."	1
"I	1
am	1
not	1
your	1
enemy!	1
I	1
believe	1
you	1
are	1
out	1
of	1
your	1
senses,	1
Archer!"	1
said	1
he,	1
laughing.	1
"Out	1
of	1
my	1
senses!	1
No;	1
you	1
are	1
my	1
enemy!	1
Are	1
you	1
not	1
my	1
rival?	1
Did	1
not	1
you	1
win	1
the	1
premium?	1
Did	1
not	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
be	1
manager?	1
Answer	1
me,	1
are	1
not	1
you,	1
in	1
one	1
word,	1
a	1
Greybeard?"	1
"You	1
called	1
me	1
a	1
Greybeard,	1
but	1
my	1
name	1
is	1
De	1
Grey,"	1
said	1
he,	1
still	1
laughing.	1
"Laugh	1
on!"	1
cried	1
the	1
other,	1
furiously.	1
"Come,	1
ARCHERS,	1
follow	1
me.	1
WE	1
shall	1
laugh	1
by-and-by,	1
I	1
promise	1
you."	1
At	1
the	1
door	1
Archer	1
was	1
stopped	1
by	1
Mr.	1
Chip.	1
"Oh,	1
Mr.	1
Chip,	1
I	1
am	1
ordered	1
to	1
discharge	1
you."	1
"Yes,	1
sir;	1
and	1
here's	1
a	1
little	1
bill--"	1
"Bill,	1
Mr.	1
Chip!	1
why,	1
you	1
have	1
not	1
been	1
at	1
work	1
for	1
two	1
hours!"	1
"Not	1
much	1
over,	1
sir;	1
but	1
if	1
you'll	1
please	1
to	1
look	1
into	1
it,	1
you'll	1
see	1
'tis	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
things	1
you	1
ordered.	1
The	1
stuff	1
is	1
all	1
laid	1
out	1
and	1
delivered.	1
The	1
paper	1
and	1
the	1
festoon-bordering	1
for	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
scene	1
is	1
cut	1
out,	1
and	1
left	1
yAnder	1
within."	1
"YAnder,	1
within!	1
I	1
wish	1
you	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
confounded	1
hurry--	1
six-and-twenty	1
shillings!"	1
cried	1
he;	1
"but	1
I	1
can't	1
stay	1
to	1
talk	1
about	1
it	1
now.	1
I'll	1
tell	1
you,	1
Mr.	1
Chip,"	1
said	1
Archer,	1
lowering	1
his	1
voice,	1
"what	1
you	1
must	1
do	1
for	1
me,	1
my	1
good	1
fellow."	1
Then,	1
drawing	1
Mr.	1
Chip	1
aside,	1
he	1
begged	1
him	1
to	1
pull	1
down	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
wood	1
work	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
put	1
up,	1
and	1
to	1
cut	1
it	1
into	1
a	1
certain	1
number	1
of	1
wooden	1
bars,	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
gave	1
him	1
the	1
dimensions,	1
with	1
orders	1
to	1
place	1
them	1
all,	1
when	1
ready,	1
under	1
a	1
haystack,	1
which	1
he	1
pointed	1
out.	1
Mr.	1
Chip	1
scrupled	1
and	1
hesitated,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
talk	1
of	1
"THE	1
DOCTOR."	1
Archer	1
immediately	1
began	1
to	1
talk	1
of	1
the	1
bill,	1
and	1
throwing	1
down	1
a	1
guinea	1
and	1
a	1
half,	1
the	1
conscientious	1
carpenter	1
pocketed	1
the	1
money	1
directly,	1
and	1
made	1
his	1
bow.	1
"Well,	1
Master	1
Archer,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"there's	1
no	1
refusing	1
you	1
nothing.	1
You	1
have	1
such	1
a	1
way	1
of	1
talking	1
one	1
out	1
of	1
it.	1
You	1
manage	1
me	1
just	1
like	1
a	1
child."	1
"Ay,	1
ay!"	1
said	1
Archer,	1
knowing	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
cheated,	1
and	1
yet	1
proud	1
of	1
managing	1
a	1
carpenter,	1
"ay,	1
ay!	1
I	1
know	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
manage	1
everybody.	1
Let	1
the	1
things	1
be	1
ready	1
in	1
an	1
hour's	1
time,	1
and	1
hark'e!	1
leave	1
your	1
tools	1
by	1
mistake	1
behind	1
you,	1
and	1
a	1
thousand	1
of	1
twenty-penny	1
nails.	1
Ask	1
no	1
questions,	1
and	1
keep	1
your	1
own	1
counsel	1
like	1
a	1
wise	1
man.	1
Off	1
with	1
you,	1
and	1
take	1
care	1
of	1
'THE	1
DOCTOR.'"	1
"Archers,	1
Archers,	1
to	1
the	1
Archers'	1
tree!	1
Follow	1
your	1
leader,"	1
cried	1
he,	1
sounding	1
his	1
well	1
known	1
whistle	1
as	1
a	1
signal.	1
His	1
followers	1
gathered	1
round	1
him,	1
and	1
he,	1
raising	1
himself	1
upon	1
the	1
mount	1
at	1
the	1
foot	1
of	1
the	1
tree,	1
counted	1
his	1
numbers,	1
and	1
then,	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
lower	1
than	1
usual,	1
addressed	1
them	1
thus:--"My	1
friends,	1
is	1
there	1
a	1
Greybeard	1
amongst	1
us?	1
If	1
there	1
is,	1
let	1
him	1
walk	1
off	1
at	1
once,	1
he	1
has	1
my	1
free	1
leave."	1
No	1
one	1
stirred.	1
"Then	1
we	1
are	1
all	1
Archers,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
stand	1
by	1
one	1
another.	1
Join	1
hands,	1
my	1
friends."	1
They	1
all	1
joined	1
hands.	1
"Promise	1
me	1
not	1
to	1
betray	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
on.	1
I	1
ask	1
no	1
security	1
but	1
your	1
honour."	1
They	1
all	1
gave	1
their	1
honour	1
to	1
be	1
secret	1
and	1
FAITHFUL,	1
as	1
he	1
called	1
it,	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
on.	1
"Did	1
you	1
ever	1
hear	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
thing	1
as	1
a	1
'BARRING	1
OUT,'	1
my	1
friends?"	1
They	1
had	1
heard	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
thing,	1
but	1
they	1
had	1
only	1
heard	1
of	1
it.	1
Archer	1
gave	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
a	1
"Barring	1
Out,"	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
concerned	1
at	1
his	1
school,	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
boys	1
stood	1
out	1
against	1
the	1
master,	1
and	1
gained	1
their	1
point	1
at	1
last,	1
which	1
was	1
a	1
week's	1
more	1
holidays	1
at	1
Easter.*	1
"But	1
if	1
WE	1
should	1
not	1
succeed,"	1
said	1
they,	1
"Dr.	1
Middleton	1
is	1
so	1
steady;	1
he	1
never	1
goes	1
back	1
from	1
what	1
he	1
has	1
said."	1
"Did	1
you	1
ever	1
try	1
to	1
push	1
him	1
back?	1
Let	1
us	1
be	1
steady	1
and	1
he'll	1
tremble.	1
Tyrants	1
always	1
tremble	1
when--"	1
"Oh,"	1
interrupted	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
voices;	1
"but	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
tyrant--is	1
he?"	1
"All	1
schoolmasters	1
are	1
tyrants--are	1
not	1
they?"	1
replied	1
Archer;	1
"and	1
is	1
not	1
he	1
a	1
schoolmaster?"	1
To	1
this	1
logic	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
answer;	1
but,	1
still	1
reluctant,	1
they	1
asked,	1
"What	1
they	1
should	1
GET	1
by	1
a	1
Barring	1
Out?"	1
"Get!--everything!--what	1
we	1
want!--which	1
is	1
everything	1
to	1
lads	1
of	1
spirit-	1
-victory	1
and	1
liberty!	1
Bar	1
him	1
out	1
till	1
he	1
repeals	1
his	1
tyrannical	1
law;	1
till	1
he	1
lets	1
us	1
into	1
our	1
own	1
theatre	1
again,	1
or	1
till	1
he	1
tells	1
us	1
his	1
'GOOD	1
REASONS'	1
against	1
it."	1
"But	1
perhaps	1
he	1
has	1
reasons	1
for	1
not	1
telling	1
us."	1
"Impossible!"	1
cried	1
Archer,	1
"that's	1
the	1
way	1
we	1
are	1
always	1
to	1
be	1
governed	1
by	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
a	1
wig,	1
who	1
says	1
he	1
has	1
good	1
reasons,	1
and	1
can't	1
tell	1
them.	1
Are	1
you	1
fools?	1
Go!	1
go	1
back	1
to	1
De	1
Grey!	1
I	1
see	1
you	1
are	1
all	1
Greybeards.	1
Go!	1
Who	1
goes	1
first?"	1
Nobody	1
would	1
go	1
FIRST.	1
"I	1
will	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
ye,	1
if	1
ye	1
are	1
resolved	1
to	1
be	1
slaves!"	1
"We	1
won't	1
be	1
slaves!"	1
they	1
all	1
exclaimed	1
at	1
once.	1
"Then,"	1
said	1
Archer,	1
"stand	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
right	1
and	1
be	1
free."	1
*[This	1
custom	1
of	1
"BARRING	1
OUT"	1
was	1
very	1
general	1
(especially	1
in	1
the	1
northern	1
parts	1
of	1
England)	1
during	1
the	1
17th	1
and	1
18th	1
centuries,	1
and	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
fully	1
described	1
by	1
Brand	1
and	1
other	1
antiquarian	1
writers.	1
Dr.	1
Johnson	1
mentions	1
that	1
Addison,	1
while	1
under	1
the	1
tuition	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Shaw,	1
master	1
of	1
the	1
Lichfield	1
Grammar	1
School,	1
led,	1
and	1
successfully	1
conducted,	1
"a	1
plan	1
for	1
BARRING	1
OUT	1
his	1
master.	1
A	1
disorderly	1
privilege,"	1
says	1
the	1
doctor,	1
"which,	1
in	1
his	1
time,	1
prevailed	1
in	1
the	1
principal	1
seminaries	1
of	1
education."	1
In	1
the	1
Gentleman's	1
Magazine	1
of	1
1828,	1
Dr.	1
P.	1
A.	1
Nuttall,	1
under	1
the	1
signature	1
of	1
II.	1
A.	1
N.,	1
has	1
given	1
a	1
spirited	1
sketch	1
of	1
a	1
"BARRING	1
OUT"	1
at	1
the	1
Ormskirk	1
Grammar	1
School,	1
which	1
has	1
since	1
been	1
republished	1
at	1
length	1
(though	1
without	1
acknowledgment),	1
by	1
Sir	1
Henry	1
Ellis,	1
in	1
Bohn's	1
recent	1
edition	1
of	1
Brand's	1
"Popular	1
Antiquities."	1
This	1
operation	1
took	1
place	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
present	1
century,	1
and	1
is	1
interesting	1
from	1
its	1
being,	1
perhaps,	1
the	1
last	1
attempt	1
on	1
record,	1
and	1
also	1
from	1
the	1
circumstance	1
of	1
the	1
writer	1
himself	1
having	1
been	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
juvenile	1
leaders	1
in	1
the	1
daring	1
adventure,	1
"quo	1
rum	1
pars	1
magna	1
fuit,"--Ed.]	1
"THE	1
RIGHT."	1
It	1
would	1
have	1
taken	1
up	1
too	1
much	1
time	1
to	1
examine	1
what	1
"THE	1
RIGHT"	1
was.	1
Archer	1
was	1
always	1
sure	1
that	1
"THE	1
RIGHT"	1
was	1
what	1
his	1
party	1
chose	1
to	1
do;	1
that	1
is,	1
what	1
he	1
chose	1
to	1
do	1
himself;	1
and	1
such	1
is	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
numbers	1
upon	1
each	1
other,	1
in	1
conquering	1
the	1
feelings	1
of	1
shame	1
and	1
in	1
confusing	1
the	1
powers	1
of	1
reasoning,	1
that	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
"the	1
right"	1
was	1
forgotten,	1
and	1
each	1
said	1
to	1
himself,	1
"To	1
be	1
sure,	1
Archer	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
clever	1
boy,	1
and	1
he	1
can't	1
be	1
mistaken";	1
or,	1
"to	1
be	1
sure,	1
Townsend	1
thinks	1
so,	1
and	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
do	1
anything	1
to	1
get	1
us	1
into	1
a	1
scrape";	1
or,	1
"to	1
be	1
sure,	1
everybody	1
will	1
agree	1
to	1
this	1
but	1
myself,	1
and	1
I	1
can't	1
stand	1
out	1
alone,	1
to	1
be	1
pointed	1
at	1
as	1
a	1
Greybeard	1
and	1
a	1
slave.	1
Everybody	1
thinks	1
it	1
is	1
right,	1
and	1
everybody	1
can't	1
be	1
wrong."	1
By	1
some	1
of	1
these	1
arguments,	1
which	1
passed	1
rapidly	1
through	1
the	1
mind	1
without	1
his	1
being	1
conscious	1
of	1
them,	1
each	1
boy	1
decided,	1
and	1
deceived	1
himself--what	1
none	1
would	1
have	1
done	1
alone,	1
none	1
scrupled	1
to	1
do	1
as	1
a	1
party.	1
It	1
was	1
determined,	1
then,	1
that	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
a	1
Barring	1
Out.	1
The	1
arrangement	1
of	1
the	1
affair	1
was	1
left	1
to	1
their	1
new	1
manager,	1
to	1
whom	1
they	1
all	1
pledged	1
implicit	1
obedience.	1
Obedience,	1
it	1
seems,	1
is	1
necessary,	1
even	1
from	1
rebels	1
to	1
their	1
ringleaders;	1
not	1
reasonable,	1
but	1
implicit	1
obedience.	1
Scarcely	1
had	1
the	1
assembly	1
adjourned	1
to	1
the	1
Ball-alley,	1
when	1
Fisher,	1
with	1
an	1
important	1
length	1
of	1
face,	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
manager,	1
and	1
desired	1
to	1
speak	1
one	1
word	1
to	1
him.	1
"My	1
advice	1
to	1
you,	1
Archer,	1
is,	1
to	1
do	1
nothing	1
in	1
this	1
till	1
we	1
have	1
consulted,	1
YOU	1
KNOW	1
WHO,	1
about	1
whether	1
it's	1
right	1
or	1
wrong."	1
"'YOU	1
KNOW	1
WHO!'	1
Whom	1
do	1
you	1
mean?	1
Make	1
haste,	1
and	1
don't	1
make	1
so	1
many	1
faces,	1
for	1
I'm	1
in	1
a	1
hurry.	1
Who	1
is	1
'YOU	1
KNOW	1
WHO?'"	1
"The	1
old	1
woman,"	1
said	1
Fisher,	1
gravely;	1
"the	1
gipsy."	1
"You	1
may	1
consult	1
the	1
old	1
woman,"	1
said	1
Archer,	1
bursting	1
out	1
a-laughing,	1
"about	1
what's	1
right	1
and	1
wrong,	1
if	1
you	1
please;	1
but	1
no	1
old	1
woman	1
shall	1
decide	1
for	1
me."	1
"No;	1
but	1
you	1
don't	1
TAKE	1
me,"	1
said	1
Fisher;	1
"you	1
don't	1
TAKE	1
me.	1
By	1
right	1
and	1
wrong,	1
I	1
mean	1
lucky	1
and	1
unlucky."	1
"Whatever	1
_I_	1
do	1
will	1
be	1
lucky,"	1
replied	1
Archer.	1
"My	1
gipsy	1
told	1
you	1
that	1
already."	1
"I	1
know,	1
I	1
know,"	1
said	1
Fisher,	1
"and	1
what	1
she	1
said	1
about	1
your	1
friends	1
being	1
lucky--that	1
went	1
a	1
great	1
way	1
with	1
many,"	1
added	1
he,	1
with	1
a	1
sagacious	1
nod	1
of	1
his	1
head;	1
"I	1
can	1
tell	1
you	1
THAT--more	1
than	1
you	1
think.	1
Do	1
you	1
know,"	1
said	1
he,	1
laying	1
hold	1
of	1
Archer's	1
button,	1
"I'm	1
in	1
the	1
secret.	1
There	1
are	1
nine	1
of	1
us	1
have	1
crooked	1
our	1
little	1
fingers	1
upon	1
it,	1
not	1
to	1
stir	1
a	1
step	1
till	1
we	1
get	1
her	1
advice;	1
and	1
she	1
has	1
appointed	1
me	1
to	1
meet	1
her	1
about	1
particular	1
business	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
at	1
eight.	1
So	1
I'm	1
to	1
consult	1
her	1
and	1
to	1
bring	1
her	1
answer."	1
Archer	1
knew	1
too	1
well	1
how	1
to	1
govern	1
fools,	1
to	1
attempt	1
to	1
reason	1
with	1
them;	1
and,	1
instead	1
of	1
laughing	1
any	1
longer	1
at	1
Fisher's	1
ridiculous	1
superstition,	1
he	1
was	1
determined	1
to	1
take	1
advantage	1
of	1
it.	1
He	1
affected	1
to	1
be	1
persuaded	1
of	1
the	1
wisdom	1
of	1
the	1
measure;	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
watch;	1
urged	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
exact	1
to	1
a	1
moment;	1
conjured	1
him	1
to	1
remember	1
exactly	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
oracle;	1
and,	1
above	1
all	1
things,	1
to	1
demand	1
the	1
lucky	1
hour	1
and	1
minute	1
when	1
the	1
Barring	1
Out	1
should	1
begin.	1
With	1
these	1
instructions	1
Archer	1
put	1
his	1
watch	1
into	1
the	1
solemn	1
dupe's	1
hand,	1
and	1
left	1
him	1
to	1
count	1
the	1
seconds,	1
till	1
the	1
moment	1
of	1
his	1
appointment,	1
whilst	1
he	1
ran	1
off	1
himself	1
to	1
prepare	1
the	1
oracle.	1
At	1
a	1
little	1
gate	1
which	1
looked	1
into	1
a	1
lane,	1
through	1
which	1
he	1
guessed	1
that	1
the	1
gipsy	1
must	1
pass,	1
he	1
stationed	1
himself,	1
saw	1
her,	1
gave	1
her	1
half	1
a	1
crown	1
and	1
her	1
instructions,	1
made	1
his	1
escape,	1
and	1
got	1
back	1
unsuspected	1
to	1
Fisher,	1
whom	1
he	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
attitude	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
him,	1
watching	1
the	1
motion	1
of	1
the	1
minute	1
hand.	1
Proud	1
of	1
his	1
secret	1
commission,	1
Fisher	1
slouched	1
his	1
hat,	1
he	1
knew	1
not	1
why,	1
over	1
his	1
face,	1
and	1
proceeded	1
towards	1
the	1
appointed	1
spot.	1
To	1
keep,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
charged	1
by	1
Archer,	1
within	1
the	1
letter	1
of	1
the	1
law,	1
he	1
stood	1
BEHIND	1
the	1
forbidden	1
building,	1
and	1
waited	1
some	1
minutes.	1
Through	1
a	1
gap	1
in	1
the	1
hedge	1
the	1
old	1
woman	1
at	1
length	1
made	1
her	1
appearance,	1
muffled	1
up,	1
and	1
looking	1
cautiously	1
about	1
her.	1
"There's	1
nobody	1
near	1
us!"	1
said	1
Fisher,	1
and	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
little	1
afraid.	1
"What	1
answer,"	1
said	1
he,	1
recollecting	1
himself,	1
"about	1
my	1
Livy?"	1
"Lost!	1
lost!	1
lost!"	1
said	1
the	1
gipsy,	1
lifting	1
up	1
her	1
hands;	1
"never,	1
never,	1
never	1
to	1
be	1
found!	1
But	1
no	1
matter	1
for	1
that	1
now;	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
your	1
errand	1
to-night;	1
no	1
tricks	1
with	1
me;	1
speak	1
to	1
me	1
of	1
what	1
is	1
next	1
your	1
heart."	1
Fisher,	1
astonished,	1
put	1
his	1
hand	1
upon	1
his	1
heart,	1
told	1
her	1
all	1
that	1
she	1
knew	1
before,	1
and	1
received	1
the	1
answers	1
that	1
Archer	1
had	1
dictated:	1
"That	1
the	1
Archers	1
should	1
be	1
lucky	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
they	1
stuck	1
to	1
their	1
manager,	1
and	1
to	1
one	1
another;	1
that	1
the	1
Barring	1
Out	1
should	1
end	1
in	1
woe,	1
if	1
not	1
begun	1
precisely	1
as	1
the	1
clock	1
should	1
strike	1
nine	1
on	1
Wednesday	1
night;	1
but	1
if	1
begun	1
in	1
that	1
LUCKY	1
moment,	1
and	1
all	1
obedient	1
to	1
their	1
LUCKY	1
leader,	1
all	1
should	1
end	1
well."	1
A	1
thought,	1
a	1
provident	1
thought,	1
now	1
struck	1
Fisher;	1
for	1
even	1
he	1
had	1
some	1
foresight	1
where	1
his	1
favourite	1
passion	1
was	1
concerned.	1
"Pray,	1
in	1
our	1
Barring	1
Out	1
shall	1
we	1
be	1
starved?"	1
"No,"	1
said	1
the	1
gipsy,	1
"not	1
if	1
you	1
trust	1
to	1
me	1
for	1
food,	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
give	1
me	1
money	1
enough.	1
Silver	1
won't	1
do	1
for	1
so	1
many;	1
gold	1
is	1
what	1
must	1
cross	1
my	1
hand."	1
"I	1
have	1
no	1
gold,"	1
said	1
Fisher,	1
"and	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
what	1
you	1
mean	1
by	1
'so	1
many.'	1
I'm	1
only	1
talking	1
of	1
number	1
one,	1
you	1
know.	1
I	1
must	1
take	1
care	1
of	1
that	1
first."	1
So,	1
as	1
Fisher	1
thought	1
it	1
was	1
possible	1
that	1
Archer,	1
clever	1
as	1
he	1
was,	1
might	1
be	1
disappointed	1
in	1
his	1
supplies,	1
he	1
determined	1
to	1
take	1
secret	1
measures	1
for	1
himself.	1
His	1
Aunt	1
Barbara's	1
interdiction	1
had	1
shut	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
confectioner's	1
shop;	1
but	1
he	1
flattered	1
himself	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
outwit	1
his	1
aunt;	1
he	1
therefore	1
begged	1
the	1
gipsy	1
to	1
procure	1
him	1
twelve	1
buns	1
by	1
Thursday	1
morning,	1
and	1
bring	1
them	1
secretly	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
windows	1
of	1
the	1
schoolroom.	1
As	1
Fisher	1
did	1
not	1
produce	1
any	1
money	1
when	1
he	1
made	1
this	1
proposal,	1
it	1
was	1
at	1
first	1
absolutely	1
rejected;	1
but	1
a	1
bribe	1
at	1
length	1
conquered	1
his	1
difficulties;	1
and	1
the	1
bribe	1
which	1
Fisher	1
found	1
himself	1
obliged	1
to	1
give--	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
pocket	1
money	1
left	1
of	1
his	1
own,	1
he	1
being	1
as	1
much	1
RESTRICTED	1
in	1
that	1
article	1
as	1
Archer	1
was	1
INDULGED--the	1
bribe	1
that	1
he	1
found	1
himself	1
obliged	1
to	1
give	1
to	1
quiet	1
the	1
gipsy	1
was	1
half	1
a	1
crown,	1
which	1
Archer	1
had	1
intrusted	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
buy	1
candles	1
for	1
the	1
theatre.	1
"Oh,"	1
thought	1
he	1
to	1
himself;	1
"Archer's	1
so	1
careless	1
about	1
money,	1
he	1
will	1
never	1
think	1
of	1
asking	1
me	1
for	1
the	1
half-crown	1
again;	1
and	1
now	1
he'll	1
want	1
no	1
candles	1
for	1
the	1
THEATRE;	1
or,	1
at	1
anyrate,	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
some	1
time	1
first;	1
and	1
maybe,	1
Aunt	1
Barbara	1
may	1
be	1
got	1
to	1
give	1
me	1
that	1
much	1
at	1
Christmas;	1
then,	1
if	1
the	1
worst	1
comes	1
to	1
the	1
worst,	1
one	1
can	1
pay	1
Archer.	1
My	1
mouth	1
waters	1
for	1
the	1
buns,	1
and	1
have	1
'em	1
I	1
must	1
now."	1
So,	1
for	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
twelve	1
buns,	1
he	1
sacrificed	1
the	1
money	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
intrusted	1
to	1
him.	1
Thus	1
the	1
meanest	1
motives,	1
in	1
mean	1
minds	1
often	1
prompt	1
to	1
the	1
commission	1
of	1
those	1
great	1
faults,	1
to	1
which	1
one	1
should	1
think	1
nothing	1
but	1
some	1
violent	1
passion	1
could	1
have	1
tempted.	1
The	1
ambassador	1
having	1
thus,	1
in	1
his	1
opinion,	1
concluded	1
his	1
own	1
and	1
the	1
public	1
business,	1
returned	1
well	1
satisfied	1
with	1
the	1
result,	1
after	1
receiving	1
the	1
gipsy's	1
reiterated	1
promise	1
to	1
tap	1
THREE	1
TIMES	1
at	1
the	1
window	1
on	1
Thursday	1
morning.	1
The	1
day	1
appointed	1
for	1
the	1
Barring	1
Out	1
at	1
length	1
arrived;	1
and	1
Archer,	1
assembling	1
the	1
confederates,	1
informed	1
them,	1
that	1
all	1
was	1
prepared	1
for	1
carrying	1
their	1
design	1
into	1
execution;	1
that	1
he	1
now	1
depended	1
for	1
success	1
upon	1
their	1
punctuality	1
and	1
courage.	1
He	1
had,	1
within	1
the	1
last	1
two	1
hours,	1
got	1
all	1
their	1
bars	1
ready	1
to	1
fasten	1
the	1
doors	1
and	1
window	1
shutters	1
of	1
the	1
schoolroom;	1
he	1
had,	1
with	1
the	1
assistance	1
of	1
two	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
scholars	1
who	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
party,	1
sent	1
into	1
the	1
town	1
for	1
provisions,	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
expense,	1
which	1
would	1
make	1
a	1
handsome	1
supper	1
for	1
that	1
night;	1
he	1
had	1
also	1
negotiated	1
with	1
some	1
cousins	1
of	1
his,	1
who	1
lived	1
in	1
the	1
town,	1
for	1
a	1
constant	1
supply	1
in	1
future.	1
"Bless	1
me,"	1
exclaimed	1
Archer,	1
suddenly	1
stopping	1
in	1
this	1
narration	1
of	1
his	1
services,	1
"there's	1
one	1
thing,	1
after	1
all,	1
I've	1
forgot,	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
undone	1
without	1
it.	1
Fisher,	1
pray	1
did	1
you	1
ever	1
buy	1
the	1
candles	1
for	1
the	1
playhouse?"	1
"No,	1
to	1
be	1
sure,"	1
replied	1
Fisher,	1
extremely	1
frightened;	1
"you	1
know	1
you	1
don't	1
want	1
candles	1
for	1
the	1
playhouse	1
now."	1
"Not	1
for	1
the	1
playhouse,	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
Barring	1
Out.	1
We	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
dark,	1
man.	1
You	1
must	1
run	1
this	1
minute,	1
run."	1
"For	1
candles?"	1
said	1
Fisher,	1
confused;	1
"how	1
many?--what	1
sort?"	1
"Stupidity!"	1
exclaimed	1
Archer,	1
"you	1
are	1
a	1
pretty	1
fellow	1
at	1
a	1
dead	1
lift!	1
Lend	1
me	1
a	1
pencil	1
and	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
paper,	1
do;	1
I'll	1
write	1
down	1
what	1
I	1
want	1
myself!	1
Well,	1
what	1
are	1
you	1
fumbling	1
for?"	1
"For	1
money!"	1
said	1
Fisher,	1
colouring.	1
"Money,	1
man!	1
Didn't	1
I	1
give	1
you	1
half	1
a	1
crown	1
the	1
other	1
day?"	1
"Yes,"	1
replied	1
Fisher,	1
stammering;	1
"but	1
I	1
wasn't	1
sure	1
that	1
that	1
might	1
be	1
enough."	1
"Enough!	1
yes,	1
to	1
be	1
sure	1
it	1
will.	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
what	1
you	1
are	1
AT."	1
"Nothing,	1
nothing,"	1
said	1
Fisher,	1
"here,	1
write	1
upon	1
this,	1
then,"	1
said	1
Fisher,	1
putting	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
paper	1
into	1
Archer's	1
hand,	1
upon	1
which	1
Archer	1
wrote	1
his	1
orders.	1
"Away,	1
away!"	1
cried	1
he.	1
Away	1
went	1
Fisher.	1
He	1
returned;	1
but	1
not	1
until	1
a	1
considerable	1
time	1
afterwards.	1
They	1
were	1
at	1
supper	1
when	1
he	1
returned.	1
"Fisher	1
always	1
comes	1
in	1
at	1
supper-time,"	1
observed	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
Greybeards,	1
carelessly.	1
"Well,	1
and	1
would	1
you	1
have	1
him	1
come	1
in	1
AFTER	1
supper-time?"	1
said	1
Townsend,	1
who	1
always	1
supplied	1
his	1
party	1
with	1
ready	1
wit.	1
"I've	1
got	1
the	1
candles,"	1
whispered	1
Fisher	1
as	1
he	1
passed	1
by	1
Archer	1
to	1
his	1
place.	1
"And	1
the	1
tinder-box?"	1
said	1
Archer.	1
"Yes;	1
I	1
got	1
back	1
from	1
my	1
Aunt	1
Barbara	1
under	1
pretence	1
that	1
I	1
must	1
study	1
for	1
repetition	1
day	1
an	1
hour	1
later	1
to-night.	1
So	1
I	1
got	1
leave.	1
Was	1
not	1
that	1
clever?"	1
A	1
dunce	1
always	1
thinks	1
it	1
clever	1
to	1
cheat	1
even	1
by	1
SOBER	1
LIES.	1
How	1
Mr.	1
Fisher	1
procured	1
the	1
candles	1
and	1
the	1
tinder	1
box	1
without	1
money,	1
and	1
without	1
credit,	1
we	1
shall	1
discover	1
further	1
on.	1
Archer	1
and	1
his	1
associates	1
had	1
agreed	1
to	1
stay	1
the	1
last	1
in	1
the	1
schoolroom;	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
Greybeards	1
were	1
gone	1
out	1
to	1
bed,	1
he,	1
as	1
the	1
signal,	1
was	1
to	1
shut	1
and	1
lock	1
one	1
door,	1
Townsend	1
the	1
other.	1
A	1
third	1
conspirator	1
was	1
to	1
strike	1
a	1
light,	1
in	1
case	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
secure	1
a	1
candle.	1
A	1
fourth	1
was	1
to	1
take	1
charge	1
of	1
the	1
candle	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
lighted;	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
were	1
to	1
run	1
to	1
their	1
bars,	1
which	1
were	1
secreted	1
in	1
a	1
room;	1
then	1
to	1
fix	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
common	1
fastening	1
bars	1
of	1
the	1
window,	1
in	1
the	1
manner	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
previously	1
instructed	1
by	1
the	1
manager.	1
Thus	1
each	1
had	1
his	1
part	1
assigned,	1
and	1
each	1
was	1
warned	1
that	1
the	1
success	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
depended	1
upon	1
their	1
order	1
and	1
punctuality.	1
Order	1
and	1
punctuality,	1
it	1
appears,	1
are	1
necessary	1
even	1
in	1
a	1
Barring	1
Out;	1
and	1
even	1
rebellion	1
must	1
have	1
its	1
laws.	1
The	1
long	1
expected	1
moment	1
at	1
length	1
arrived.	1
De	1
Grey	1
and	1
his	1
friends,	1
unconscious	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
going	1
forward,	1
walked	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
schoolroom	1
as	1
usual	1
at	1
bedtime.	1
The	1
clock	1
began	1
to	1
strike	1
nine.	1
There	1
was	1
one	1
Greybeard	1
left	1
in	1
the	1
room,	1
who	1
was	1
packing	1
up	1
some	1
of	1
his	1
books,	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
left	1
about	1
by	1
accident.	1
It	1
is	1
impossible	1
to	1
describe	1
the	1
impatience	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
watched,	1
especially	1
by	1
Fisher,	1
and	1
the	1
nine	1
who	1
depended	1
upon	1
the	1
gipsy	1
oracle.	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
got	1
all	1
his	1
books	1
together	1
under	1
his	1
arm,	1
he	1
let	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
fall;	1
and	1
whilst	1
he	1
stooped	1
to	1
pick	1
it	1
up,	1
Archer	1
gave	1
the	1
signal.	1
The	1
doors	1
were	1
shut,	1
locked,	1
and	1
double-locked	1
in	1
an	1
instant.	1
A	1
light	1
was	1
struck	1
and	1
each	1
ran	1
to	1
his	1

The	1
bars	1
were	1
all	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
moment	1
put	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
windows,	1
and	1
Archer,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
tried	1
them	1
all,	1
and	1
seen	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
secure,	1
gave	1
a	1
loud	1
"Huzza!"--in	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
joined	1
by	1
all	1
the	1
party	1
most	1
manfully--by	1
all	1
but	1
the	1
poor	1
Greybeard,	1
who,	1
the	1
picture	1
of	1
astonishment,	1
stood	1
stock	1
still	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
them	1
with	1
his	1
books	1
under	1
his	1
arm;	1
at	1
which	1
spectacle	1
Townsend,	1
who	1
enjoyed	1
the	1
FROLIC	1
of	1
the	1
fray	1
more	1
than	1
anything	1
else,	1
burst	1
into	1
an	1
immoderate	1
fit	1
of	1
laughter.	1
"So,	1
my	1
little	1
Greybeard,"	1
said	1
he,	1
holding	1
a	1
candle	1
full	1
in	1
his	1
eyes,	1
"what	1
think	1
you	1
of	1
all	1
this?--How	1
came	1
you	1
amongst	1
the	1
wicked	1
ones?"	1
"I	1
don't	1
know,	1
indeed,"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
boy,	1
very	1
gravely:	1
"you	1
shut	1
me	1
up	1
amongst	1
you.	1
Won't	1
you	1
let	1
me	1
out?"	1
"Let	1
you	1
out!	1
No,	1
no,	1
my	1
little	1
Greybeard,"	1
said	1
Archer,	1
catching	1
hold	1
of	1
him,	1
and	1
dragging	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
window	1
bars.	1
"Look	1
ye	1
here--touch	1
these-	1
-put	1
your	1
hand	1
to	1
them--pull,	1
push,	1
kick--put	1
a	1
little	1
spirit	1
into	1
it,	1
man--kick	1
like	1
an	1
Archer,	1
if	1
you	1
can;	1
away	1
with	1
ye.	1
It's	1
a	1
pity	1
that	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
Greybeards	1
is	1
not	1
here	1
to	1
admire	1
me.	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
show	1
him	1
our	1
fortifications.	1
But	1
come,	1
my	1
merry	1
men	1
all,	1
now	1
to	1
the	1
feast.	1
Out	1
with	1
the	1
table	1
into	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
room.	1
Good	1
cheer,	1
my	1
jolly	1
Archers!	1
I'm	1
your	1
manager!"	1
Townsend,	1
delighted	1
with	1
the	1
bustle,	1
rubbed	1
his	1
hands,	1
and	1
capered	1
about	1
the	1
room,	1
whilst	1
the	1
preparations	1
for	1
the	1
feast	1
were	1
hurried	1
forward.	1
"Four	1
candles!--Four	1
candles	1
on	1
the	1
table.	1
Let's	1
have	1
things	1
in	1
style	1
when	1
we	1
are	1
about	1
it,	1
Mr.	1
Manager,"	1
cried	1
Townsend.	1
"Places!--Places!	1
There's	1
nothing	1
like	1
a	1
fair	1
scramble,	1
my	1
boys.	1
Let	1
everyone	1
take	1
care	1
of	1
himself.	1
Hallo!	1
Greybeard,	1
I've	1
knocked	1
Greybeard	1
down	1
here	1
in	1
the	1
scuffle.	1
Get	1
up	1
again,	1
my	1
lad,	1
and	1
see	1
a	1
little	1
life."	1
"No,	1
no,"	1
cried	1
Fisher,	1
"he	1
sha'n't	1
SUP	1
with	1
us."	1
"No,	1
no,"	1
cried	1
the	1
manager,	1
"he	1
shan't	1
LIVE	1
with	1
us;	1
a	1
Greybeard	1
is	1
not	1
fit	1
company	1
for	1
Archers."	1
"No,	1
no,"	1
cried	1
Townsend,	1
"evil	1
communication	1
corrupts	1
good	1
manners."	1
So	1
with	1
one	1
unanimous	1
hiss	1
they	1
hunted	1
the	1
poor	1
little	1
gentle	1
boy	1
into	1
a	1
corner;	1
and	1
having	1
pent	1
him	1
up	1
with	1
benches,	1
Fisher	1
opened	1
his	1
books	1
for	1
him,	1
which	1
he	1
thought	1
the	1
greatest	1
mortification,	1
and	1
set	1
up	1
a	1
candle	1
beside	1
him--"There,	1
now	1
he	1
looks	1
like	1
a	1
Greybeard	1
as	1
he	1
is!"	1
cried	1
they.	1
"Tell	1
me	1
what's	1
the	1
Latin	1
for	1
cold	1
roast	1
beef?"	1
said	1
Fisher,	1
exultingly,	1
and	1
they	1
returned	1
to	1
their	1
feast.	1
Long	1
and	1
loud	1
they	1
revelled.	1
They	1
had	1
a	1
few	1
bottles	1
of	1
cider.	1
"Give	1
me	1
the	1
corkscrew,	1
the	1
cider	1
sha'n't	1
be	1
kept	1
till	1
it's	1
sour,"	1
cried	1
Townsend,	1
in	1
answer	1
to	1
the	1
manager,	1
who,	1
when	1
he	1
beheld	1
the	1
provisions	1
vanishing	1
with	1
surprising	1
rapidity,	1
began	1
to	1
fear	1
for	1
the	1
morrow.	1
"Hang	1
to-	1
morrow!"	1
cried	1
Townsend,	1
"let	1
Greybeards	1
think	1
of	1
to-morrow;	1
Mr.	1
Manager,	1
here's	1
your	1
good	1
health."	1
The	1
Archers	1
all	1
stood	1
up	1
as	1
their	1
cups	1
were	1
filled	1
to	1
drink	1
the	1
health	1
of	1
their	1
chief	1
with	1
a	1
universal	1
cheer.	1
But	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
that	1
the	1
cups	1
were	1
at	1
their	1
lips,	1
and	1
as	1
Archer	1
bowed	1
to	1
thank	1
the	1
company,	1
a	1
sudden	1
shower	1
from	1
above	1
astonished	1
the	1
whole	1
assembly.	1
They	1
looked	1
up,	1
and	1
beheld	1
the	1
rose	1
of	1
a	1
watering-engine,	1
whose	1
long	1
neck	1
appeared	1
through	1
a	1
trap	1
door	1
in	1
the	1
ceiling.	1
"Your	1
good	1
health,	1
Mr.	1
Manager!"	1
said	1
a	1
voice,	1
which	1
was	1
known	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
gardener's;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
their	1
surprise	1
and	1
dismay	1
the	1
candles	1
were	1
suddenly	1
extinguished;	1
the	1
trap-door	1
shut	1
down;	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
left	1
in	1
utter	1
darkness.	1
"The	1
DEVIL!"	1
said	1
Archer."	1
"Don't	1
swear,	1
Mr.	1
Manager,"	1
said	1
the	1
same	1
voice	1
from	1
the	1
ceiling,	1
"I	1
hear	1
every	1
word	1
you	1
say."	1
"Mercy	1
upon	1
us!"	1
exclaimed	1
Fisher.	1
"The	1
clock,"	1
added	1
he,	1
whispering,	1
"must	1
have	1
been	1
wrong,	1
for	1
it	1
had	1
not	1
done	1
striking	1
when	1
we	1
began.	1
Only,	1
you	1
remember,	1
Archer,	1
it	1
had	1
just	1
done	1
before	1
you	1
had	1
done	1
locking	1
your	1
door."	1
"Hold	1
your	1
tongue,	1
blockhead!"	1
said	1
Archer.	1
"Well,	1
boys!	1
were	1
ye	1
never	1
in	1
the	1
dark	1
before?	1
You	1
are	1
not	1
afraid	1
of	1
a	1
shower	1
of	1
rain,	1
I	1
hope.	1
Is	1
anybody	1
drowned?"	1
"No,"	1
said	1
they,	1
with	1
a	1
faint	1
laugh,	1
"but	1
what	1
shall	1
we	1
do	1
here	1
in	1
the	1
dark	1
all	1
night	1
long,	1
and	1
all	1
day	1
to-morrow?	1
We	1
can't	1
unbar	1
the	1
shutters."	1
"It's	1
a	1
wonder	1
NOBODY	1
ever	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
trap-door!"	1
said	1
Townsend.	1
The	1
trap-door	1
had	1
indeed	1
escaped	1
the	1
manager's	1
observation.	1
As	1
the	1
house	1
was	1
new	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
ceiling	1
being	1
newly	1
white-washed,	1
the	1
opening	1
was	1
scarcely	1
perceptible.	1
Vexed	1
to	1
be	1
out-generalled,	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
vexed	1
to	1
have	1
it	1
remarked,	1
Archer	1
poured	1
forth	1
a	1
volley	1
of	1
incoherent	1
exclamations	1
and	1
reproaches	1
against	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
thus	1
so	1
soon	1
discouraged	1
by	1
a	1
trifle;	1
and	1
groping	1
for	1
the	1
tinder-box,	1
he	1
asked	1
if	1
anything	1
could	1
be	1
easier	1
than	1
to	1
strike	1
a	1
light	1
again.*	1
The	1
light	1
appeared.	1
But	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
that	1
it	1
made	1
the	1
tinder-box	1
visible,	1
another	1
shower	1
from	1
above,	1
aimed,	1
and	1
aimed	1
exactly,	1
at	1
the	1
tinder-box,	1
drenched	1
it	1
with	1
water,	1
and	1
rendered	1
it	1
totally	1
unfit	1
for	1
further	1
service.	1
Archer	1
in	1
a	1
fury	1
dashed	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
ground.	1
And	1
now	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
he	1
felt	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
unsuccessful	1
head	1
of	1
a	1
party.	1
He	1
heard	1
in	1
his	1
turn	1
the	1
murmurs	1
of	1
a	1
discontented,	1
changeable	1
populace;	1
and	1
recollecting	1
all	1
his	1
bars	1
and	1
bolts,	1
and	1
ingenious	1
contrivances,	1
he	1
was	1
more	1
provoked	1
at	1
their	1
blaming	1
him	1
for	1
this	1
one	1
only	1
oversight	1
than	1
he	1
was	1
grieved	1
at	1
the	1
disaster	1
itself.	1
*Lucifer	1
matches	1
were	1
then	1
unknown.--Ed.	1
"Oh,	1
my	1
hair	1
is	1
all	1
wet!"	1
cried	1
one,	1
dolefully.	1
"Wring	1
it,	1
then,"	1
said	1
Archer.	1
"My	1
hand's	1
cut	1
with	1
your	1
broken	1
glass,"	1
cried	1
another.	1
"Glass!"	1
cried	1
a	1
third;	1
"mercy!	1
is	1
there	1
broken	1
glass?	1
and	1
it's	1
all	1
about,	1
I	1
suppose,	1
amongst	1
the	1
supper;	1
and	1
I	1
had	1
but	1
one	1
bit	1
of	1
bread	1
all	1
the	1
time."	1
"Bread!"	1
cried	1
Archer;	1
"eat	1
if	1
you	1
want	1
it.	1
Here's	1
a	1
piece	1
here,	1
and	1
no	1
glass	1
near	1
it."	1
"It's	1
all	1
wet,	1
and	1
I	1
don't	1
like	1
dry	1
bread	1
by	1
itself;	1
that's	1
no	1
feast."	1
"Heigh-day!	1
What,	1
nothing	1
but	1
moaning	1
and	1
grumbling!	1
If	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
joys	1
of	1
a	1
Barring	1
Out,"	1
cried	1
Townsend,	1
"I'd	1
rather	1
be	1
snug	1
in	1
my	1
bed.	1
I	1
expected	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
have	1
sat	1
up	1
till	1
twelve	1
o'clock,	1
talking,	1
and	1
laughing,	1
and	1
singing."	1
"So	1
you	1
may	1
still;	1
what	1
hinders	1
you?"	1
said	1
Archer.	1
"Sing,	1
and	1
we'll	1
join	1
you,	1
and	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
glad	1
those	1
fellows	1
overhead	1
heard	1
us	1
singing.	1
Begin,	1
Townsend--	1
"'Come	1
now,	1
all	1
ye	1
social	1
Powers,	1
Spread	1
your	1
influence	1
o'er	1
us'--	1
Or	1
else--	1
"'Rule,	1
Britannia!	1
Britannia	1
rules	1
the	1
waves!	1
Britons	1
never	1
will	1
be	1
slaves.'"	1
Nothing	1
can	1
be	1
more	1
melancholy	1
than	1
forced	1
merriment.	1
In	1
vain	1
they	1
roared	1
in	1
chorus.	1
In	1
vain	1
they	1
tried	1
to	1
appear	1
gay.	1
It	1
would	1
not	1
do.	1
The	1
voices	1
died	1
away,	1
and	1
dropped	1
off	1
one	1
by	1
one.	1
They	1
had	1
each	1
provided	1
himself	1
with	1
a	1
great-coat	1
to	1
sleep	1
upon;	1
but	1
now,	1
in	1
the	1
dark,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
peevish	1
scrambling	1
contest	1
for	1
the	1
coats,	1
and	1
half	1
the	1
company,	1
in	1
very	1
bad	1
humour,	1
stretched	1
themselves	1
upon	1
the	1
benches	1
for	1
the	1
night.	1
There	1
is	1
great	1
pleasure	1
in	1
bearing	1
anything	1
that	1
has	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
hardship	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
there	1
is	1
any	1
glory	1
to	1
be	1
acquired	1
by	1
it:	1
but	1
when	1
people	1
feel	1
themselves	1
foiled,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
further	1
pleasure	1
in	1
endurance;	1
and	1
if,	1
in	1
their	1
misfortune,	1
there	1
is	1
any	1
mixture	1
of	1
the	1
ridiculous,	1
the	1
motives	1
for	1
heroism	1
are	1
immediately	1
destroyed.	1
Dr.	1
Middleton	1
had	1
probably	1
considered	1
this	1
in	1
the	1
choice	1
he	1
made	1
of	1
his	1
first	1
attack.	1
Archer,	1
who	1
had	1
spent	1
the	1
night	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
the	1
cares	1
of	1
government	1
upon	1
his	1
shoulders,	1
rose	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
whilst	1
everybody	1
else	1
was	1
fast	1
asleep.	1
In	1
the	1
night	1
he	1
had	1
resolved	1
the	1
affair	1
of	1
the	1
trap-door,	1
and	1
a	1
new	1
danger	1
had	1
alarmed	1
him.	1
It	1
was	1
possible	1
that	1
the	1
enemy	1
might	1
descend	1
upon	1
them	1
through	1
the	1
trap-door.	1
The	1
room	1
had	1
been	1
built	1
high	1
to	1
admit	1
a	1
free	1
circulation	1
of	1
air.	1
It	1
was	1
twenty	1
feet,	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
vain	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
reaching	1
to	1
the	1
trap-door.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
daylight	1
appeared,	1
Archer	1
rose	1
softly,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
RECONNOITRE,	1
and	1
devise	1
some	1
method	1
of	1
guarding	1
against	1
this	1
new	1
danger.	1
Luckily	1
there	1
were	1
round	1
holes	1
in	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
window-shutters,	1
which	1
admitted	1
sufficient	1
light	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
work	1
by.	1
The	1
remains	1
of	1
the	1
soaked	1
feast,	1
wet	1
candles,	1
and	1
broken	1
glass	1
spread	1
over	1
the	1
table	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
room,	1
looked	1
rather	1
dismal	1
this	1
morning.	1
'A	1
pretty	1
set	1
of	1
fellows	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
manage!"	1
said	1
Archer,	1
contemplating	1
the	1
group	1
of	1
sleepers	1
before	1
him.	1
"It	1
is	1
well	1
they	1
have	1
somebody	1
to	1
think	1
for	1
them.	1
Now	1
if	1
I	1
wanted--which,	1
thank	1
goodness,	1
I	1
don't--but	1
if	1
I	1
did	1
want	1
to	1
call	1
a	1
cabinet	1
council	1
to	1
my	1
assistance,	1
whom	1
could	1
I	1
pitch	1
upon?	1
not	1
this	1
stupid	1
snorer,	1
who	1
is	1
dreaming	1
of	1
gipsies,	1
if	1
he	1
is	1
dreaming	1
of	1
anything,"	1
continued	1
Archer,	1
as	1
he	1
looked	1
into	1
Fisher's	1
open	1
mouth.	1
"This	1
next	1
chap	1
is	1
quick	1
enough;	1
but,	1
then,	1
he	1
is	1
so	1
fond	1
of	1
having	1
everything	1
his	1
own	1
way.	1
And	1
this	1
curl	1
pated	1
monkey,	1
who	1
is	1
grinning	1
in	1
his	1
sleep,	1
is	1
all	1
tongue	1
and	1
no	1
brains.	1
Here	1
are	1
brains,	1
though	1
nobody	1
would	1
think	1
it,	1
in	1
this	1
lump,"	1
said	1
he,	1
looking	1
at	1
a	1
fat,	1
rolled	1
up,	1
heavy	1
breathing	1
sleeper;	1
"but	1
what	1
signify	1
brains	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
lazy	1
dog?	1
I	1
might	1
kick	1
him	1
for	1
my	1
football	1
this	1
half	1
hour	1
before	1
I	1
should	1
get	1
him	1
awake.	1
This	1
lank	1
jawed	1
harlequin	1
beside	1
him	1
is	1
a	1
handy	1
fellow,	1
to	1
be	1
sure;	1
but,	1
then,	1
if	1
he	1
has	1
hands,	1
he	1
has	1
no	1
head--and	1
he'd	1
be	1
afraid	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
shadow	1
too,	1
by	1
this	1
light,	1
he	1
is	1
such	1
a	1
coward!	1
And	1
Townsend,	1
why,	1
he	1
has	1
puns	1
in	1
plenty;	1
but,	1
when	1
there's	1
any	1
work	1
to	1
be	1
done,	1
he's	1
the	1
worst	1
fellow	1
to	1
be	1
near	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
world--he	1
can	1
do	1
nothing	1
but	1
laugh	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
puns.	1
This	1
poor	1
little	1
fellow	1
that	1
we	1
hunted	1
into	1
the	1
corner	1
has	1
more	1
sense	1
than	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
put	1
together;	1
but	1
then	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
Greybeard."	1
Thus	1
speculated	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
a	1
party	1
upon	1
his	1
sleeping	1
friends.	1
And	1
how	1
did	1
it	1
happen	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
so	1
ambitious	1
to	1
please	1
and	1
govern	1
this	1
set,	1
when,	1
for	1
each	1
individual	1
of	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
composed,	1
he	1
felt	1
such	1
supreme	1
contempt?	1
He	1
had	1
formed	1
them	1
into	1
a	1
PARTY,	1
had	1
given	1
them	1
a	1
name,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
their	1
head.	1
If	1
these	1
be	1
not	1
good	1
reasons,	1
none	1
better	1
can	1
be	1
assigned	1
for	1
Archer's	1
conduct.	1
"I	1
wish	1
ye	1
could	1
all	1
sleep	1
on,"	1
said	1
he;	1
"but	1
I	1
must	1
waken	1
ye,	1
though	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
only	1
in	1
my	1
way.	1
The	1
sound	1
of	1
my	1
hammering	1
must	1
waken	1
them;	1
so	1
I	1
may	1
as	1
well	1
do	1
the	1
thing	1
handsomely,	1
and	1
flatter	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
by	1
pretending	1
to	1
ask	1
their	1
advice."	1
Accordingly,	1
he	1
pulled	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
to	1
waken	1
them.	1
"Come,	1
Townsend,	1
waken,	1
my	1
boy!	1
Here's	1
some	1
diversion	1
for	1
you--up!	1
up!"	1
"Diversion!"	1
cried	1
Townsend;	1
"I'm	1
your	1
man!	1
I'm	1
up--UP	1
TO	1
ANYTHING."	1
So,	1
under	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
DIVERSION,	1
Archer	1
set	1
Townsend	1
to	1
work	1
at	1
four	1
o'clock	1
in	1
the	1
morning.	1
They	1
had	1
nails,	1
a	1
few	1
tools,	1
and	1
several	1
spars,	1
still	1
left	1
from	1
the	1
wreck	1
of	1
the	1
playhouse.	1
These,	1
by	1
Archer's	1
directions,	1
they	1
sharpened	1
at	1
one	1
end,	1
and	1
nailed	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
several	1
forms.	1
All	1
hands	1
were	1
now	1
called	1
to	1
clear	1
away	1
the	1
supper	1
things,	1
to	1
erect	1
these	1
forms	1
perpendicularly	1
under	1
the	1
trap-door;	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
assistance	1
of	1
a	1
few	1
braces,	1
a	1
chevaux-de-frise	1
was	1
formed,	1
upon	1
which	1
nobody	1
could	1
venture	1
to	1
descend.	1
At	1
the	1
farthest	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
they	1
likewise	1
formed	1
a	1
penthouse	1
of	1
the	1
tables,	1
under	1
which	1
they	1
proposed	1
to	1
breakfast,	1
secure	1
from	1
the	1
pelting	1
storm,	1
if	1
it	1
should	1
again	1
assail	1
them	1
through	1
the	1
trap-	1
door.	1
They	1
crowded	1
under	1
the	1
penthouse	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
ready,	1
and	1
their	1
admiration	1
of	1
its	1
ingenuity	1
paid	1
the	1
workmen	1
for	1
the	1
job.	1
"Lord!	1
I	1
shall	1
like	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
gardener's	1
phiz	1
through	1
the	1
trap-door,	1
when	1
he	1
beholds	1
the	1
spikes	1
under	1
him!"	1
cried	1
Townsend.	1
"Now	1
for	1
breakfast!"	1
"Ay,	1
now	1
for	1
breakfast,"	1
said	1
Archer,	1
looking	1
at	1
his	1
watch;	1
"past	1
eight	1
o'clock,	1
and	1
my	1
town	1
boys	1
not	1
come!	1
I	1
don't	1
understand	1
this!"	1
Archer	1
had	1
expected	1
a	1
constant	1
supply	1
of	1
provisions	1
from	1
two	1
boys	1
who	1
lived	1
in	1
the	1
town,	1
who	1
were	1
cousins	1
of	1
his,	1
and	1
who	1
had	1
promised	1
to	1
come	1
every	1
day,	1
and	1
put	1
food	1
in	1
at	1
a	1
certain	1
hole	1
in	1
the	1
wall,	1
in	1
which	1
a	1
ventilator	1
usually	1
turned.	1
This	1
ventilator	1
Archer	1
had	1
taken	1
down,	1
and	1
had	1
contrived	1
it	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
could	1
be	1
easily	1
removed	1
and	1
replaced	1
at	1
pleasure;	1
but,	1
upon	1
examination,	1
it	1
was	1
now	1
perceived	1
that	1
the	1
hole	1
had	1
been	1
newly	1
stopped	1
up	1
by	1
an	1
iron	1
back,	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
penetrate	1
or	1
remove.	1
"It	1
never	1
came	1
into	1
my	1
head	1
that	1
anybody	1
would	1
ever	1
have	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
ventilator	1
but	1
myself!"	1
exclaimed	1
Archer,	1
in	1
great	1
perplexity.	1
He	1
listened	1
and	1
waited	1
for	1
his	1
cousins;	1
but	1
no	1
cousins	1
came,	1
and	1
at	1
a	1
late	1
hour	1
the	1
company	1
were	1
obliged	1
to	1
breakfast	1
upon	1
the	1
scattered	1
fragments	1
of	1
the	1
last	1
night's	1
feast.	1
That	1
feast	1
had	1
been	1
spread	1
with	1
such	1
imprudent	1
profusion,	1
that	1
little	1
now	1
remained	1
to	1
satisfy	1
the	1
hungry	1
guests.	1
Archer,	1
who	1
well	1
knew	1
the	1
effect	1
which	1
the	1
apprehension	1
of	1
a	1
scarcity	1
would	1
have	1
upon	1
his	1
associates,	1
did	1
everything	1
that	1
could	1
be	1
done	1
by	1
a	1
bold	1
countenance	1
and	1
reiterated	1
assertions	1
to	1
persuade	1
them	1
that	1
his	1
cousins	1
would	1
certainly	1
come	1
at	1
last	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
supplies	1
were	1
only	1
delayed.	1
The	1
delay,	1
however,	1
was	1
alarming.	1
Fisher	1
alone	1
heard	1
the	1
manager's	1
calculations	1
and	1
saw	1
the	1
public	1
fears	1
unmoved.	1
Secretly	1
rejoicing	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
wisdom,	1
he	1
walked	1
from	1
window	1
to	1
window,	1
slily	1
listening	1
for	1
the	1
gipsy's	1
signal.	1
"There	1
it	1
is!"	1
cried	1
he	1
with	1
more	1
joy	1
sparkling	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
than	1
had	1
ever	1
enlightened	1
them	1
before.	1
"Come	1
this	1
way,	1
Archer;	1
but	1
don't	1
tell	1
anybody.	1
Hark!	1
do	1
ye	1
hear	1
those	1
three	1
taps	1
at	1
the	1
window?	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
old	1
woman	1
with	1
twelve	1
buns	1
for	1
me.	1
I'll	1
give	1
you	1
one	1
whole	1
one	1
for	1
yourself,	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
unbar	1
the	1
window	1
for	1
me."	1
"Unbar	1
the	1
window!"	1
interrupted	1
Archer;	1
"no,	1
that	1
I	1
won't,	1
for	1
you	1
or	1
the	1
gipsy	1
either;	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
enough	1
to	1
get	1
your	1
buns	1
without	1
that.	1
But	1
stay;	1
there	1
is	1
something	1
of	1
more	1
consequence	1
than	1
your	1
twelve	1
buns.	1
I	1
must	1
think	1
for	1
ye	1
all,	1
I	1
see,	1
regularly."	1
So	1
he	1
summoned	1
a	1
council,	1
and	1
proposed	1
that	1
everyone	1
should	1
subscribe,	1
and	1
trust	1
the	1
subscription	1
to	1
the	1
gipsy,	1
to	1
purchase	1
a	1
fresh	1
supply	1
of	1
provisions.	1
Archer	1
laid	1
down	1
a	1
guinea	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
money	1
for	1
his	1
subscription;	1
at	1
which	1
sight	1
all	1
the	1
company	1
clapped	1
their	1
hands,	1
and	1
his	1
popularity	1
rose	1
to	1
a	1
high	1
pitch	1
with	1
their	1
renewed	1
hopes	1
of	1
plenty.	1
Now,	1
having	1
made	1
a	1
list	1
of	1
their	1
wants,	1
they	1
folded	1
the	1
money	1
in	1
the	1
paper,	1
put	1
it	1
into	1
a	1
bag,	1
which	1
Archer	1
tied	1
to	1
a	1
long	1
string,	1
and,	1
having	1
broken	1
the	1
pane	1
of	1
glass	1
behind	1
the	1
round	1
hole	1
in	1
the	1
window-shutter,	1
he	1
let	1
down	1
the	1
bag	1
to	1
the	1
gipsy.	1
She	1
promised	1
to	1
be	1
punctual,	1
and	1
having	1
filled	1
the	1
bag	1
with	1
Fisher's	1
twelve	1
buns,	1
they	1
were	1
drawn	1
up	1
in	1
triumph,	1
and	1
everybody	1
anticipated	1
the	1
pleasure	1
with	1
which	1
they	1
should	1
see	1
the	1
same	1
bag	1
drawn	1
up	1
at	1
dinner-time.	1
The	1
buns	1
were	1
a	1
little	1
squeezed	1
in	1
being	1
drawn	1
through	1
the	1
hole	1
in	1
the	1
window-shutter;	1
but	1
Archer	1
immediately	1
sawed	1
out	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
the	1
shutter,	1
and	1
broke	1
the	1
corresponding	1
panes	1
in	1
each	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
windows,	1
to	1
prevent	1
suspicion,	1
and	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
appear	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
all	1
been	1
broken	1
to	1
admit	1
air.	1
What	1
a	1
pity	1
that	1
so	1
much	1
ingenuity	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
employed	1
to	1
no	1
purpose!	1
It	1
may	1
have	1
surprised	1
the	1
intelligent	1
reader	1
that	1
the	1
gipsy	1
was	1
so	1
punctual	1
to	1
her	1
promise	1
to	1
Fisher,	1
but	1
we	1
must	1
recollect	1
that	1
her	1
apparent	1
integrity	1
was	1
only	1
cunning;	1
she	1
was	1
punctual	1
that	1
she	1
might	1
be	1
employed	1
again,	1
that	1
she	1
might	1
be	1
intrusted	1
with	1
the	1
contribution	1
which,	1
she	1
foresaw,	1
must	1
be	1
raised	1
amongst	1
the	1
famishing	1
garrison.	1
No	1
sooner	1
had	1
she	1
received	1
the	1
money	1
than	1
her	1
end	1
was	1
gained.	1
Dinner-time	1
came;	1
it	1
struck	1
three,	1
four,	1
five,	1
six.	1
They	1
listened	1
with	1
hungry	1
ears,	1
but	1
no	1
signal	1
was	1
heard.	1
The	1
morning	1
had	1
been	1
very	1
long,	1
and	1
Archer	1
had	1
in	1
vain	1
tried	1
to	1
dissuade	1
them	1
from	1
devouring	1
the	1
remainder	1
of	1
the	1
provisions	1
before	1
they	1
were	1
sure	1
of	1
a	1
fresh	1
supply.	1
And	1
now	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
most	1
confident	1
were	1
the	1
most	1
impatient	1
of	1
their	1
disappointment.	1
Archer,	1
in	1
the	1
division	1
of	1
the	1
food,	1
had	1
attempted,	1
by	1
the	1
most	1
scrupulous	1
exactness,	1
to	1
content	1
the	1
public,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
both	1
astonished	1
and	1
provoked	1
to	1
perceive	1
that	1
his	1
impartiality	1
was	1
impeached.	1
So	1
differently	1
do	1
people	1
judge	1
in	1
different	1
situations!	1
He	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
person	1
to	1
accuse	1
his	1
master	1
of	1
injustice,	1
and	1
the	1
least	1
capable	1
of	1
bearing	1
such	1
an	1
imputation	1
upon	1
himself	1
from	1
others.	1
He	1
now	1
experienced	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
joys	1
of	1
power,	1
and	1
the	1
delight	1
of	1
managing	1
unreasonable	1
numbers.	1
"Have	1
not	1
I	1
done	1
everything	1
I	1
could	1
to	1
please	1
you?	1
Have	1
not	1
I	1
spent	1
my	1
money	1
to	1
buy	1
you	1
food?	1
Have	1
not	1
I	1
divided	1
the	1
last	1
morsel	1
with	1
you?	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
tasted	1
one	1
mouthful	1
today!	1
Did	1
not	1
I	1
set	1
to	1
work	1
for	1
you	1
at	1
sunrise?	1
Did	1
not	1
I	1
lie	1
awake	1
all	1
night	1
for	1
you?	1
Have	1
not	1
I	1
had	1
all	1
the	1
labour,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
anxiety?	1
Look	1
round	1
and	1
see	1
MY	1
contrivances,	1
MY	1
work,	1
MY	1
generosity!	1
And,	1
after	1
all,	1
you	1
think	1
me	1
a	1
tyrant,	1
because	1
I	1
want	1
you	1
to	1
have	1
common	1
sense.	1
Is	1
not	1
this	1
bun	1
which	1
I	1
hold	1
in	1
my	1
hand	1
my	1
own?	1
Did	1
not	1
I	1
earn	1
it	1
by	1
my	1
own	1
ingenuity	1
from	1
that	1
selfish	1
dunce"	1
(pointing	1
to	1
Fisher),	1
"who	1
could	1
never	1
have	1
gotten	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
twelve	1
buns,	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
shown	1
him	1
how?	1
Eleven	1
of	1
them	1
he	1
has	1
eaten	1
since	1
morning	1
for	1
his	1
own	1
share,	1
without	1
offering	1
anyone	1
a	1
morsel;	1
but	1
I	1
scorn	1
to	1
eat	1
even	1
what	1
is	1
justly	1
my	1
own,	1
when	1
I	1
see	1
so	1
many	1
hungry	1
creatures	1
longing	1
for	1
it.	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
going	1
to	1
touch	1
this	1
last	1
morsel	1
myself.	1
I	1
only	1
begged	1
you	1
to	1
keep	1
it	1
till	1
supper-time,	1
when	1
perhaps	1
you'll	1
want	1
it	1
more,	1
and	1
Townsend,	1
who	1
can't	1
bear	1
the	1
slightest	1
thing	1
that	1
crosses	1
his	1
own	1
whims,	1
and	1
who	1
thinks	1
there's	1
nothing	1
in	1
this	1
world	1
to	1
be	1
minded	1
but	1
his	1
own	1
diversion,	1
calls	1
me	1
a	1
TYRANT.	1
You	1
all	1
of	1
you	1
promised	1
to	1
obey	1
me.	1
The	1
first	1
thing	1
I	1
ask	1
you	1
to	1
do	1
for	1
your	1
own	1
good,	1
and	1
when,	1
if	1
you	1
had	1
common	1
sense,	1
you	1
must	1
know	1
I	1
can	1
want	1
nothing	1
but	1
your	1
good,	1
you	1
rebel	1
against	1
me.	1
Traitors!	1
fools!	1
ungrateful	1
fools!"	1
Archer	1
walked	1
up	1
and	1
down,	1
unable	1
to	1
command	1
his	1
emotion,	1
whilst,	1
for	1
the	1
moment,	1
the	1
discontented	1
multitude	1
was	1
silenced.	1
"Here,"	1
said	1
he,	1
striking	1
his	1
hand	1
upon	1
the	1
little	1
boy's	1
shoulder,	1
"here's	1
the	1
only	1
one	1
amongst	1
you	1
who	1
has	1
not	1
uttered	1
one	1
word	1
of	1
reproach	1
or	1
complaint,	1
and	1
he	1
has	1
had	1
but	1
one	1
bit	1
of	1
bread--a	1
bit	1
that	1
I	1
gave	1
him	1
myself	1
this	1
day.	1
Here!"	1
said	1
he,	1
snatching	1
the	1
bun,	1
which	1
nobody	1
had	1
dared	1
to	1
touch,	1
"take	1
it--it's	1
mine--I	1
give	1
it	1
to	1
you,	1
though	1
you	1
are	1
a	1
Greybeard;	1
you	1
deserve	1
it.	1
Eat	1
it,	1
and	1
be	1
an	1
Archer.	1
You	1
shall	1
be	1
my	1
captain;	1
will	1
you?"	1
said	1
he,	1
lifting	1
him	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
arm	1
above	1
the	1
rest.	1
"I	1
like	1
you	1
now,"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
boy,	1
courageously;	1
"but	1
I	1
love	1
De	1
Grey	1
better;	1
he	1
has	1
always	1
been	1
my	1
friend,	1
and	1
he	1
advised	1
me	1
never	1
to	1
call	1
myself	1
any	1
of	1
those	1
names,	1
Archer	1
or	1
Greybeard;	1
so	1
I	1
won't.	1
Though	1
I	1
am	1
shut	1
in	1
here,	1
I	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
it.	1
I	1
love	1
Dr.	1
Middleton;	1
he	1
was	1
never	1
unjust	1
to	1
ME,	1
and	1
I	1
daresay	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
very	1
good	1
reasons,	1
as	1
De	1
Grey	1
said,	1
for	1
forbidding	1
us	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
that	1
house.	1
Besides,	1
it's	1
his	1
own."	1
Instead	1
of	1
admiring	1
the	1
good	1
sense	1
and	1
steadiness	1
of	1
this	1
little	1
lad,	1
Archer	1
suffered	1
Townsend	1
to	1
snatch	1
the	1
untasted	1
bun	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
hands.	1
He	1
flung	1
it	1
at	1
a	1
hole	1
in	1
the	1
window,	1
but	1
it	1
fell	1
back.	1
The	1
Archers	1
scrambled	1
for	1
it,	1
and	1
Fisher	1
ate	1
it.	1
Archer	1
saw	1
this,	1
and	1
was	1
sensible	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
done	1
handsomely	1
in	1
suffering	1
it.	1
A	1
few	1
moments	1
ago	1
he	1
had	1
admired	1
his	1
own	1
generosity,	1
and	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
felt	1
the	1
injustice	1
of	1
others,	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
accused	1
himself	1
of	1
any.	1
He	1
turned	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
little	1
boy,	1
and	1
sitting	1
down	1
at	1
one	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
table,	1
hid	1
his	1
face	1
in	1
his	1
hands.	1
He	1
continued	1
immovable	1
in	1
this	1
posture	1
for	1
some	1
time.	1
"Lord!"	1
said	1
Townsend;	1
"it	1
was	1
an	1
excellent	1
joke!"	1
"Pooh!"	1
said	1
Fisher;	1
"what	1
a	1
fool,	1
to	1
think	1
so	1
much	1
about	1
a	1
bun!"	1
"Never	1
mind,	1
Mr.	1
Archer,	1
if	1
you	1
are	1
thinking	1
about	1
me,"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
boy,	1
trying	1
gently	1
to	1
pull	1
his	1
hands	1
from	1
his	1
face.	1
Archer	1
stooped	1
down,	1
and	1
lifted	1
him	1
up	1
upon	1
the	1
table,	1
at	1
which	1
sight	1
the	1
partisans	1
set	1
up	1
a	1
general	1
hiss.	1
"He	1
has	1
forsaken	1
us!	1
He	1
deserts	1
his	1
party!	1
He	1
wants	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
Greybeard!	1
After	1
he	1
has	1
got	1
us	1
all	1
into	1
this	1
scrape,	1
he	1
will	1
leave	1
us!"	1
"I	1
am	1
not	1
going	1
to	1
leave	1
you,"	1
cried	1
Archer.	1
"No	1
one	1
shall	1
ever	1
accuse	1
me	1
of	1
deserting	1
my	1
party.	1
I'll	1
stick	1
by	1
the	1
Archers,	1
right	1
or	1
wrong,	1
I	1
tell	1
you,	1
to	1
the	1
last	1
moment.	1
But	1
this	1
little	1
fellow--take	1
it	1
as	1
you	1
please,	1
mutiny	1
if	1
you	1
will,	1
and	1
throw	1
me	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window.	1
Call	1
me	1
traitor!	1
coward!	1
Greybeard!--this	1
little	1
fellow	1
is	1
worth	1
you	1
all	1
put	1
together,	1
and	1
I'll	1
stand	1
by	1
him	1
against	1
anyone	1
who	1
dares	1
to	1
lay	1
a	1
finger	1
upon	1
him;	1
and	1
the	1
next	1
morsel	1
of	1
food	1
that	1
I	1
see	1
shall	1
be	1
his.	1
Touch	1
him	1
who	1
dares!"	1
The	1
commanding	1
air	1
with	1
which	1
Archer	1
spoke	1
and	1
looked,	1
and	1
the	1
belief	1
that	1
the	1
little	1
boy	1
deserved	1
his	1
protection,	1
silenced	1
the	1
crowd.	1
But	1
the	1
storm	1
was	1
only	1
hushed.	1
No	1
sound	1
of	1
merriment	1
was	1
now	1
to	1
be	1
heard--no	1
battledore	1
and	1
shuttlecock-	1
-no	1
ball,	1
no	1
marbles.	1
Some	1
sat	1
in	1
a	1
corner,	1
whispering	1
their	1
wishes	1
that	1
Archer	1
would	1
unbar	1
the	1
doors,	1
and	1
give	1
up.	1
Others,	1
stretching	1
their	1
arms,	1
and	1
gaping	1
as	1
they	1
sauntered	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
room,	1
wished	1
for	1
air,	1
or	1
food,	1
or	1
water.	1
Fisher	1
and	1
his	1
nine,	1
who	1
had	1
such	1
firm	1
dependence	1
upon	1
the	1
gipsy,	1
now	1
gave	1
themselves	1
up	1
to	1
utter	1
despair.	1
It	1
was	1
eight	1
o'clock,	1
growing	1
darker	1
and	1
darker	1
every	1
minute,	1
and	1
no	1
candles,	1
no	1
light	1
could	1
they	1
have.	1
The	1
prospect	1
of	1
another	1
long	1
dark	1
night	1
made	1
them	1
still	1
more	1
discontented.	1
Townsend,	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
yawners,	1
and	1
Fisher,	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
hungry	1
malcontents,	1
gathered	1
round	1
Archer	1
and	1
the	1
few	1
yet	1
unconquered	1
spirits,	1
demanding	1
"How	1
long	1
he	1
meant	1
to	1
keep	1
them	1
in	1
this	1
dark	1
dungeon?	1
and	1
whether	1
he	1
expected	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
starve	1
themselves	1
for	1
his	1
sake?"	1
The	1
idea	1
of	1
GIVING	1
UP	1
was	1
more	1
intolerable	1
to	1
Archer	1
than	1
all	1
the	1
rest.	1
He	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
majority,	1
his	1
own	1
convincing	1
argument,	1
was	1
against	1
him.	1
He	1
was	1
therefore	1
obliged	1
to	1
condescend	1
to	1
the	1
arts	1
of	1
persuasion.	1
He	1
flattered	1
some	1
with	1
hopes	1
of	1
food	1
from	1
the	1
town	1
boys.	1
Some	1
he	1
reminded	1
of	1
their	1
promises;	1
others	1
he	1
praised	1
for	1
former	1
prowess;	1
and	1
others	1
he	1
shamed	1
by	1
the	1
repetition	1
of	1
their	1
high	1
vaunts	1
in	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
business.	1
It	1
was	1
at	1
length	1
resolved	1
that	1
at	1
all	1
events	1
they	1
WOULD	1
HOLD	1
OUT.	1
With	1
this	1
determination	1
they	1
stretched	1
themselves	1
again	1
to	1
sleep,	1
for	1
the	1
second	1
night,	1
in	1
weak	1
and	1
weary	1
obstinacy.	1
Archer	1
slept	1
longer	1
and	1
more	1
soundly	1
than	1
usual	1
the	1
next	1
morning,	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
awoke,	1
he	1
found	1
his	1
hands	1
tied	1
behind	1
him!	1
Three	1
or	1
four	1
boys	1
had	1
just	1
got	1
hold	1
of	1
his	1
feet,	1
which	1
they	1
pressed	1
down,	1
whilst	1
the	1
trembling	1
hands	1
of	1
Fisher	1
were	1
fastening	1
the	1
cord	1
round	1
them.	1
With	1
all	1
the	1
force	1
which	1
rage	1
could	1
inspire,	1
Archer	1
struggled	1
and	1
roared	1
to	1
"HIS	1
ARCHERS!"--his	1
friends,	1
his	1
party--for	1
help	1
against	1
the	1
traitors.	1
But	1
all	1
kept	1
aloof.	1
Townsend,	1
in	1
particular,	1
stood	1
laughing	1
and	1
looking	1
on.	1
"I	1
beg	1
your	1
pardon,	1
Archer,	1
but	1
really	1
you	1
look	1
so	1
droll.	1
All	1
alive	1
and	1
kicking!	1
Don't	1
be	1
angry.	1
I'm	1
so	1
weak,	1
I	1
cannot	1
help	1
laughing	1
today."	1
The	1
packthread	1
cracked.	1
"His	1
hands	1
are	1
free!	1
He's	1
loose!"	1
cried	1
the	1
least	1
of	1
the	1
boys,	1
and	1
ran	1
away,	1
whilst	1
Archer	1
leaped	1
up,	1
and	1
seizing	1
hold	1
of	1
Fisher	1
with	1
a	1
powerful	1
grasp,	1
sternly	1
demanded	1
"What	1
he	1
meant	1
by	1
this?"	1
"Ask	1
my	1
party,"	1
said	1
Fisher,	1
terrified;	1
"they	1
set	1
me	1
on;	1
ask	1
my	1
party."	1
"Your	1
party!"	1
cried	1
Archer,	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
ineffable	1
contempt;	1
"you	1
reptile!--YOUR	1
party?	1
Can	1
such	1
a	1
thing	1
as	1
YOU	1
have	1
a	1
party?"	1
"To	1
be	1
sure!"	1
said	1
Fisher,	1
settling	1
his	1
collar,	1
which	1
Archer	1
in	1
his	1
surprise	1
had	1
let	1
go;	1
"to	1
be	1
sure!	1
Why	1
not?	1
Any	1
man	1
who	1
chooses	1
it	1
may	1
have	1
a	1
party	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
yourself,	1
I	1
suppose.	1
I	1
have	1
nine	1
Fishermen."	1
At	1
these	1
words,	1
spoken	1
with	1
much	1
sullen	1
importance,	1
Archer,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
vexation,	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
laughing.	1
"Fishermen!"	1
cried	1
he,	1
"FISHERMEN!"	1
"And	1
why	1
not	1
Fishermen	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
Archers?"	1
cried	1
they.	1
"One	1
party	1
is	1
just	1
as	1
good	1
as	1
another;	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
a	1
question	1
which	1
can	1
get	1
the	1
upper	1
hand;	1
and	1
we	1
had	1
your	1
hands	1
tied	1
just	1
now."	1
"That's	1
right,	1
Townsend,"	1
said	1
Archer,	1
"laugh	1
on,	1
my	1
boy!	1
Friend	1
or	1
foe,	1
it's	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
to	1
you.	1
I	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
value	1
your	1
friendship	1
now.	1
You	1
are	1
a	1
mighty	1
good	1
fellow	1
when	1
the	1
sun	1
shines;	1
but	1
let	1
a	1
storm	1
come,	1
and	1
how	1
you	1
slink	1
away!"	1
At	1
this	1
instant,	1
Archer	1
felt	1
the	1
difference	1
between	1
A	1
GOOD	1
COMPANION	1
and	1
a	1
good	1
friend,	1
a	1
difference	1
which	1
some	1
people	1
do	1
not	1
discover	1
till	1
late	1
in	1
life.	1
"Have	1
I	1
no	1
friend?--no	1
real	1
friend	1
amongst	1
you	1
all?	1
And	1
could	1
ye	1
stand	1
by,	1
and	1
see	1
my	1
hands	1
tied	1
behind	1
me	1
like	1
a	1
thief's?	1
What	1
signifies	1
such	1
a	1
party--all	1
mute?"	1
"We	1
want	1
something	1
to	1
eat,"	1
answered	1
the	1
Fishermen.	1
"What	1
signifies	1
SUCH	1
a	1
party,	1
indeed?	1
and	1
SUCH	1
a	1
manager,	1
who	1
can	1
do	1
nothing	1
for	1
one?"	1
"And	1
have	1
_I_	1
done	1
nothing?"	1
"Don't	1
let's	1
hear	1
any	1
more	1
prosing,"	1
said	1
Fisher;	1
"we	1
are	1
too	1
many	1
for	1
you.	1
I've	1
advised	1
my	1
party,	1
if	1
they've	1
a	1
mind	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
starved,	1
to	1
give	1
you	1
up	1
for	1
the	1
ringleader,	1
as	1
you	1
were;	1
and	1
Dr.	1
Middleton	1
will	1
not	1
let	1
us	1
all	1
off,	1
I	1
daresay."	1
So,	1
depending	1
upon	1
the	1
sullen	1
silence	1
of	1
the	1
assembly,	1
he	1
again	1
approached	1
Archer	1
with	1
a	1
cord.	1
A	1
cry	1
of	1
"No,	1
no,	1
no!	1
Don't	1
tie	1
him,"	1
was	1
feebly	1
raised.	1
Archer	1
stood	1
still,	1
but	1
the	1
moment	1
Fisher	1
touched	1
him	1
he	1
knocked	1
him	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
rest,	1
with	1
eyes	1
sparkling	1
with	1
indignation,	1
"Archers!"	1
cried	1
he.	1
A	1
voice	1
at	1
this	1
instant	1
was	1
heard	1
at	1
the	1
door.	1
It	1
was	1
De	1
Grey's	1
voice.	1
"I	1
have	1
got	1
a	1
large	1
basket	1
of	1
provisions	1
for	1
your	1
breakfast."	1
A	1
general	1
shout	1
of	1
joy	1
was	1
sent	1
forth	1
by	1
the	1
voracious	1
public.	1
"Breakfast!	1
Provisions!	1
A	1
large	1
basket!	1
De	1
Grey	1
for	1
ever!	1
Huzza!"	1
De	1
Grey	1
promised,	1
upon	1
his	1
honour,	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
would	1
unbar	1
the	1
door	1
nobody	1
should	1
come	1
in	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
no	1
advantage	1
should	1
be	1
taken	1
of	1
them.	1
This	1
promise	1
was	1
enough	1
even	1
for	1
Archer.	1
"I	1
will	1
let	1
him	1
in,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"myself;	1
for	1
I'm	1
sure	1
he'll	1
never	1
break	1
his	1
word."	1
He	1
pulled	1
away	1
the	1
bar;	1
the	1
door	1
opened,	1
and	1
having	1
bargained	1
for	1
the	1
liberty	1
of	1
Melson,	1
the	1
little	1
boy,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
shut	1
in	1
by	1
mistake,	1
De	1
Grey	1
entered	1
with	1
his	1
basket	1
of	1
provisions,	1
when	1
he	1
locked	1
and	1
barred	1
the	1
door	1
instantly.	1
Joy	1
and	1
gratitude	1
sparkled	1
in	1
every	1
face	1
when	1
he	1
unpacked	1
his	1
basket,	1
and	1
spread	1
the	1
table	1
with	1
a	1
plentiful	1
breakfast.	1
A	1
hundred	1
questions	1
were	1
asked	1
him	1
at	1
once.	1
"Eat	1
first,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"and	1
we	1
will	1
talk	1
afterwards."	1
This	1
business	1
was	1
quickly	1
despatched	1
by	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
tasted	1
food	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
while.	1
Their	1
curiosity	1
increased	1
as	1
their	1
hunger	1
diminished.	1
"Who	1
sent	1
us	1
breakfast?	1
Does	1
Dr.	1
Middleton	1
know?"	1
were	1
questions	1
reiterated	1
from	1
every	1
mouth.	1
"He	1
does	1
know,"	1
answered	1
De	1
Grey;	1
"and	1
the	1
first	1
thing	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
is,	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
your	1
fellow-prisoner.	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
stay	1
here	1
till	1
you	1
give	1
up.	1
This	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
condition	1
on	1
which	1
Dr.	1
Middleton	1
would	1
allow	1
me	1
to	1
bring	1
you	1
food,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
allow	1
no	1
more."	1
Everyone	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
empty	1
basket.	1
But	1
Archer,	1
in	1
whom	1
half	1
vanquished	1
party	1
spirit	1
revived	1
with	1
the	1
strength	1
he	1
had	1
got	1
from	1
his	1
breakfast,	1
broke	1
into	1
exclamations	1
in	1
praise	1
of	1
De	1
Grey's	1
magnanimity,	1
as	1
he	1
now	1
imagined	1
that	1
De	1
Grey	1
had	1
become	1
one	1
of	1
themselves.	1
"And	1
you	1
will	1
join	1
us,	1
will	1
you?	1
That's	1
a	1
noble	1
fellow!"	1
"No,"	1
answered	1
De	1
Grey,	1
calmly;	1
"but	1
I	1
hope	1
to	1
persuade,	1
or	1
rather	1
to	1
convince	1
you,	1
that	1
you	1
ought	1
to	1
join	1
me."	1
"You	1
would	1
have	1
found	1
it	1
no	1
hard	1
task	1
to	1
have	1
persuaded	1
or	1
convinced	1
us,	1
whichever	1
you	1
pleased,"	1
said	1
Townsend,	1
"if	1
you	1
had	1
appealed	1
to	1
Archers	1
fasting;	1
but	1
Archers	1
feasting	1
are	1
quite	1
other	1
animals.	1
Even	1
Caesar	1
himself,	1
after	1
breakfast,	1
is	1
quite	1
another	1
thing!"	1
added	1
he,	1
pointing	1
to	1
Archer.	1
"You	1
may	1
speak	1
for	1
yourself,	1
Mr.	1
Townsend,"	1
replied	1
the	1
insulted	1
hero,	1
"but	1
not	1
for	1
me,	1
or	1
for	1
Archers	1
in	1
general,	1
if	1
you	1
please.	1
We	1
unbarred	1
the	1
door	1
upon	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
De	1
Grey's	1
promise--THAT	1
was	1
not	1
giving	1
up.	1
And	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
just	1
as	1
difficult,	1
I	1
promise	1
you,	1
to	1
persuade	1
or	1
convince	1
me	1
either	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
give	1
up	1
against	1
my	1
honour	1
before	1
breakfast	1
as	1
after."	1
This	1
spirited	1
speech	1
was	1
applauded	1
by	1
many,	1
who	1
had	1
now	1
forgotten	1
the	1
feelings	1
of	1
famine.	1
Not	1
so	1
Fisher,	1
whose	1
memory	1
was	1
upon	1
this	1
occasion	1
very	1
distinct.	1
"What	1
nonsense,"	1
and	1
the	1
orator	1
paused	1
for	1
a	1
synonymous	1
expression,	1
but	1
none	1
was	1
at	1
hand.	1
"What	1
nonsense	1
and--nonsense	1
is	1
here!	1
Why,	1
don't	1
you	1
remember	1
that	1
dinner-time,	1
and	1
supper-time	1
and	1
breakfast-time	1
will	1
come	1
again?	1
So	1
what	1
signifies	1
mouthing	1
about	1
persuading	1
and	1
convincing?	1
We	1
will	1
not	1
go	1
through	1
again	1
what	1
we	1
did	1
yesterday!	1
Honour	1
me	1
no	1
honour.	1
I	1
don't	1
understand	1
it.	1
I'd	1
rather	1
be	1
flogged	1
at	1
once,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
many's	1
the	1
good	1
time	1
for	1
a	1
less	1
thing.	1
I	1
say,	1
we'd	1
better	1
all	1
be	1
flogged	1
at	1
once,	1
which	1
must	1
be	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
it	1
sooner	1
or	1
later,	1
than	1
wait	1
here	1
to	1
be	1
without	1
dinner,	1
breakfast,	1
and	1
supper,	1
all	1
only	1
because	1
Mr.	1
Archer	1
won't	1
give	1
up	1
because	1
of	1
his	1
honour	1
and	1
nonsense!"	1
Many	1
prudent	1
faces	1
amongst	1
the	1
Fishermen	1
seemed	1
to	1
deliberate	1
at	1
the	1
close	1
of	1
this	1
oration,	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
arguments	1
were	1
brought	1
so	1
"home	1
to	1
each	1
man's	1
business	1
and	1
bosom."	1
"But,"	1
said	1
De	1
Grey,	1
"when	1
we	1
yield,	1
I	1
hope	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
merely	1
to	1
get	1
our	1
dinner,	1
gentlemen.	1
When	1
we	1
yield,	1
Archer--"	1
"Don't	1
address	1
yourself	1
to	1
me,"	1
interrupted	1
Archer,	1
struggling	1
with	1
his	1
pride;	1
"you	1
have	1
no	1
further	1
occasion	1
to	1
try	1
to	1
win	1
me.	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
power,	1
no	1
party,	1
you	1
see!	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
find	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
friends,	1
I	1
don't	1
care	1
what	1
becomes	1
of	1
myself.	1
I	1
suppose	1
I'm	1
to	1
be	1
given	1
up	1
as	1
a	1
ringleader.	1
Here's	1
this	1
Fisher,	1
and	1
a	1
party	1
of	1
his	1
Fishermen,	1
were	1
going	1
to	1
tie	1
me	1
hand	1
and	1
foot,	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
knocked	1
him	1
down,	1
just	1
as	1
you	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
door,	1
De	1
Grey;	1
and	1
now	1
perhaps	1
you	1
will	1
join	1
Fisher's	1
party	1
against	1
me."	1
De	1
Grey	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
assure	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
intention	1
of	1
joining	1
any	1
party,	1
when	1
a	1
sudden	1
change	1
appeared	1
on	1
Archer's	1
countenance.	1
"Silence!"	1
cried	1
Archer,	1
in	1
an	1
imperious	1
tone,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
silence.	1
Someone	1
was	1
heard	1
to	1
whistle	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
a	1
tune,	1
that	1
was	1
perfectly	1
new	1
to	1
everybody	1
present,	1
except	1
to	1
Archer,	1
who	1
immediately	1
whistled	1
the	1
conclusion.	1
"There!"	1
cried	1
he,	1
looking	1
at	1
De	1
Grey,	1
with	1
triumph;	1
"that's	1
a	1
method	1
of	1
holding	1
secret	1
correspondence	1
whilst	1
a	1
prisoner,	1
which	1
I	1
learned	1
from	1
'Richard	1
Coeur	1
de	1
Lion.'	1
I	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
make	1
use	1
of	1
everything.	1
Hallo!	1
friend!	1
are	1
you	1
there	1
at	1
last?"	1
cried	1
he,	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
ventilator.	1
"Yes,	1
but	1
we	1
are	1
barred	1
out	1
here."	1
"Round	1
to	1
the	1
window	1
then,	1
and	1
fill	1
our	1
bag.	1
We'll	1
let	1
it	1
down,	1
my	1
lad,	1
in	1
a	1
trice;	1
bar	1
me	1
out	1
who	1
can!"	1
Archer	1
let	1
down	1
the	1
bag	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
expedition	1
of	1
joy,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
expedition	1
of	1
fear.	1
"Pull	1
away!	1
make	1
haste,	1
for	1
Heaven's	1
sake!"	1
said	1
the	1
voice	1
from	1
without;	1
"the	1
gardener	1
will	1
come	1
from	1
dinner,	1
else,	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
caught.	1
He	1
mounted	1
guard	1
all	1
yesterday	1
at	1
the	1
ventilator;	1
and	1
though	1
I	1
watched	1
and	1
watched	1
till	1
it	1
was	1
darker	1
than	1
pitch,	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
get	1
near	1
you.	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
what	1
has	1
taken	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way	1
now.	1
Make	1
haste,	1
pull	1
away!"	1
The	1
heavy	1
bag	1
was	1
soon	1
pulled	1
up.	1
"Have	1
you	1
any	1
more?"	1
said	1
Archer.	1
"Yes,	1
plenty.	1
Let	1
down	1
quick!	1
I've	1
got	1
the	1
tailor's	1
bag	1
full,	1
which	1
is	1
three	1
times	1
as	1
large	1
as	1
yours,	1
and	1
I've	1
changed	1
clothes	1
with	1
the	1
tailor's	1
boy;	1
so	1
nobody	1
took	1
notice	1
of	1
me	1
as	1
I	1
came	1
down	1
the	1
street."	1
"There's	1
my	1
own	1
cousin!"	1
exclaimed	1
Archer,	1
"there's	1
a	1
noble	1
fellow!	1
there's	1
my	1
own	1
cousin,	1
I	1
acknowledge.	1
Fill	1
the	1
bag,	1
then."	1
Several	1
times	1
the	1
bag	1
descended	1
and	1
ascended;	1
and	1
at	1
every	1
unlading	1
of	1
the	1
crane,	1
fresh	1
acclamations	1
were	1
heard.	1
"I	1
have	1
no	1
more!"	1
at	1
length	1
the	1
boy	1
with	1
the	1
tailor's	1
bag	1
cried.	1
"Off	1
with	1
you,	1
then;	1
we've	1
enough,	1
and	1
thank	1
you."	1
A	1
delightful	1
review	1
was	1
now	1
made	1
of	1
their	1
treasure.	1
Busy	1
hands	1
arranged	1
and	1
sorted	1
the	1
heterogeneous	1
mass.	1
Archer,	1
in	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
his	1
glory,	1
looked	1
on,	1
the	1
acknowledged	1
master	1
of	1
the	1
whole.	1
Townsend,	1
who,	1
in	1
his	1
prosperity	1
as	1
in	1
adversity,	1
saw	1
and	1
enjoyed	1
the	1
comic	1
foibles	1
of	1
his	1
friends,	1
pushed	1
De	1
Grey,	1
who	1
was	1
looking	1
on	1
with	1
a	1
more	1
good-natured	1
and	1
more	1
thoughtful	1
air.	1
"Friend,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"you	1
look	1
like	1
a	1
great	1
philosopher,	1
and	1
Archer	1
a	1
great	1
hero."	1
"And	1
you,	1
Townsend,"	1
said	1
Archer,	1
"may	1
look	1
like	1
a	1
wit,	1
if	1
you	1
will;	1
but	1
you	1
will	1
never	1
be	1
a	1
hero."	1
"No,	1
no,"	1
replied	1
Townsend;	1
"wits	1
were	1
never	1
heroes,	1
because	1
they	1
are	1
wits.	1
You	1
are	1
out	1
of	1
your	1
wits,	1
and	1
therefore	1
may	1
set	1
up	1
for	1
a	1
hero."	1
"Laugh,	1
and	1
welcome.	1
I'm	1
not	1
a	1
tyrant.	1
I	1
don't	1
want	1
to	1
restrain	1
anybody's	1
wit;	1
but	1
I	1
cannot	1
say	1
I	1
admire	1
puns."	1
"Nor	1
I,	1
either,"	1
said	1
the	1
time	1
serving	1
Fisher,	1
sidling	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
manager,	1
and	1
picking	1
the	1
ice	1
off	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
plum-cake,	1
"nor	1
I	1
either;	1
I	1
hate	1
puns.	1
I	1
can	1
never	1
understand	1
Townsend's	1
PUNS.	1
Besides,	1
anybody	1
can	1
make	1
puns;	1
and	1
one	1
doesn't	1
want	1
wit,	1
either,	1
at	1
all	1
times;	1
for	1
instance,	1
when	1
one	1
is	1
going	1
to	1
settle	1
about	1
dinner,	1
or	1
business	1
of	1
consequence.	1
Bless	1
us	1
all,	1
Archer!"	1
continued	1
he,	1
with	1
sudden	1
familiarity;	1
"WHAT	1
A	1
SIGHT	1
OF	1
GOOD	1
THINGS	1
ARE	1
HERE!	1
I'm	1
sure	1
we	1
are	1
much	1
obliged	1
to	1
you	1
and	1
your	1
cousin.	1
I	1
never	1
thought	1
he'd	1
have	1
come.	1
Why,	1
now	1
we	1
can	1
hold	1
out	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
you	1
please.	1
Let	1
us	1
see,"	1
said	1
he,	1
dividing	1
the	1
provisions	1
upon	1
the	1
table;	1
"we	1
can	1
hold	1
out	1
to-day,	1
and	1
all	1
to-morrow,	1
and	1
part	1
of	1
next	1
day,	1
maybe.	1
Why,	1
now	1
we	1
may	1
defy	1
the	1
doctor	1
and	1
the	1
Greybeards.	1
The	1
doctor	1
will	1
surely	1
give	1
up	1
to	1
us;	1
for,	1
you	1
see,	1
he	1
knows	1
nothing	1
of	1
all	1
this,	1
and	1
he'll	1
think	1
we	1
are	1
starving	1
all	1
this	1
while;	1
and	1
he'd	1
be	1
afraid,	1
you	1
see,	1
to	1
let	1
us	1
starve	1
quite,	1
in	1
reality,	1
for	1
three	1
whole	1
days,	1
because	1
of	1
what	1
would	1
be	1
said	1
in	1
the	1
town.	1
My	1
Aunt	1
Barbara,	1
for	1
one,	1
would	1
be	1
AT	1
HIM	1
long	1
before	1
that	1
time	1
was	1
out;	1
and	1
besides,	1
you	1
know,	1
in	1
that	1
case,	1
he'd	1
be	1
hanged	1
for	1
murder,	1
which	1
is	1
quite	1
another	1
thing,	1
in	1
law,	1
from	1
a	1
BARRING	1
OUT,	1
you	1
know."	1
Archer	1
had	1
not	1
given	1
to	1
this	1
harangue	1
all	1
the	1
attention	1
which	1
it	1
deserved,	1
for	1
his	1
eye	1
was	1
fixed	1
upon	1
De	1
Grey.	1
"What	1
is	1
De	1
Grey	1
thinking	1
of?"	1
he	1
asked,	1
impatiently.	1
"I	1
am	1
thinking,"	1
said	1
De	1
Grey,	1
"that	1
Dr.	1
Middleton	1
must	1
believe	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
betrayed	1
his	1
confidence	1
in	1
me.	1
The	1
gardener	1
was	1
ordered	1
away	1
from	1
his	1
watch-post	1
for	1
one	1
half-hour	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
admitted.	1
This	1
half-hour	1
the	1
gardener	1
has	1
made	1
nearly	1
a	1
hour.	1
I	1
never	1
would	1
have	1
come	1
near	1
you	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
foreseen	1
all	1
this.	1
Dr.	1
Middleton	1
trusted	1
me,	1
and	1
now	1
he	1
will	1
repent	1
of	1
his	1
confidence	1
in	1
me."	1
"De	1
Grey!"	1
cried	1
Archer,	1
with	1
energy,	1
"he	1
shall	1
not	1
repent	1
of	1
his	1
confidence	1
in	1
you--nor	1
shall	1
you	1
repent	1
of	1
coming	1
amongst	1
us.	1
You	1
shall	1
find	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
some	1
honour	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
yourself,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
care	1
of	1
your	1
honour	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
my	1
OWN!"	1
"Hey-day!"	1
interrupted	1
Townsend;	1
"are	1
heroes	1
allowed	1
to	1
change	1
sides,	1
pray?	1
And	1
does	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
Archers	1
stand	1
talking	1
sentiment	1
to	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
Greybeards?	1
In	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
party	1
too!"	1
"Party!"	1
repeated	1
Archer,	1
disdainfully;	1
"I	1
have	1
done	1
with	1
parties!	1
I	1
see	1
what	1
parties	1
are	1
made	1
of!	1
I	1
have	1
felt	1
the	1
want	1
of	1
a	1
friend,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
determined	1
to	1
make	1
one	1
if	1
I	1
can."	1
"That	1
you	1
may	1
do,"	1
said	1
De	1
Grey,	1
stretching	1
out	1
his	1
hand.	1
"Unbar	1
the	1
doors!	1
unbar	1
the	1
windows!"	1
exclaimed	1
Archer.	1
"Away	1
with	1
all	1
these	1
things!	1
I	1
give	1
up	1
for	1
De	1
Grey's	1
sake.	1
He	1
shall	1
not	1
lose	1
his	1
credit	1
on	1
my	1
account."	1
"No,"	1
said	1
De	1
Grey,	1
"you	1
shall	1
not	1
give	1
up	1
for	1
my	1
sake."	1
"Well,	1
then,	1
I'll	1
give	1
up	1
to	1
do	1
what	1
is	1
HONOURABLE,"	1
said	1
Archer.	1
"Why	1
not	1
to	1
do	1
what	1
is	1
REASONABLE?"	1
said	1
De	1
Grey.	1
"REASONABLE!	1
Oh,	1
the	1
first	1
thing	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
spirit	1
should	1
think	1
of	1
is,	1
what	1
is	1
HONOURABLE."	1
"But	1
how	1
will	1
he	1
find	1
out	1
WHAT	1
IS	1
honourable,	1
unless	1
he	1
can	1
reason?"	1
replied	1
De	1
Grey.	1
"Oh,"	1
said	1
Archer,	1
"his	1
own	1
feelings	1
always	1
tell	1
him	1
what	1
is	1
honourable."	1
"Have	1
not	1
YOUR	1
FEELINGS,"	1
asked	1
De	1
Grey,	1
"changed	1
within	1
these	1
few	1
hours?"	1
"Yes,	1
with	1
circumstances,"	1
replied	1
Archer;	1
"but	1
right	1
or	1
wrong,	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
honourable	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
and	1
so,	1
I'm	1
satisfied."	1
"But	1
you	1
cannot	1
think	1
anything	1
honourable,	1
or	1
the	1
contrary,"	1
observed	1
De	1
Grey,	1
"without	1
reasoning;	1
and	1
as	1
to	1
what	1
you	1
call	1
feeling,	1
it's	1
only	1
a	1
quick	1
sort	1
of	1
reasoning."	1
"The	1
quicker,	1
the	1
better,"	1
said	1
Archer.	1
"Perhaps	1
not,"	1
said	1
De	1
Grey.	1
"We	1
are	1
apt	1
to	1
reason	1
best	1
when	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
in	1
quite	1
so	1
great	1
a	1
hurry."	1
"But,"	1
said	1
Archer,	1
"we	1
have	1
not	1
always	1
time	1
enough	1
to	1
reason	1
AT	1
FIRST."	1
"You	1
must,	1
however,	1
acknowledge,"	1
replied	1
De	1
Grey,	1
smiling,	1
"that	1
no	1
man	1
but	1
a	1
fool	1
thinks	1
it	1
honourable	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
wrong	1
AT	1
LAST.	1
Is	1
it	1
not,	1
therefore,	1
best	1
to	1
begin	1
by	1
reasoning	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
the	1
right	1
AT	1
FIRST?"	1
"To	1
be	1
sure,"	1
said	1
Archer.	1
"And	1
did	1
you	1
reason	1
with	1
yourself	1
at	1
first?	1
And	1
did	1
you	1
find	1
out	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
right	1
to	1
bar	1
Dr.	1
Middleton	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
schoolroom,	1
because	1
he	1
desired	1
you	1
not	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
houses?"	1
"No,"	1
replied	1
Archer;	1
"but	1
I	1
should	1
never	1
have	1
thought	1
of	1
heading	1
a	1
Barring	1
Out,	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
shown	1
partiality;	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
had	1
flown	1
into	1
a	1
passion	1
with	1
me	1
openly	1
at	1
once	1
for	1
pulling	1
down	1
your	1
scenery,	1
which	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
quite	1
natural,	1
and	1
not	1
have	1
gone	1
slily	1
and	1
forbid	1
us	1
the	1
house	1
out	1
of	1
revenge,	1
there	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
none	1
of	1
this	1
work."	1
"Why,"	1
said	1
De	1
Grey,	1
"should	1
you	1
suspect	1
me	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
mean	1
action,	1
when	1
you	1
have	1
never	1
seen	1
or	1
known	1
me	1
do	1
anything	1
mean,	1
and	1
when	1
in	1
this	1
instance	1
you	1
have	1
no	1
proofs?"	1
"Will	1
you	1
give	1
me	1
your	1
word	1
and	1
honour	1
now,	1
De	1
Grey,	1
before	1
everybody	1
here,	1
that	1
you	1
did	1
not	1
do	1
what	1
I	1
suspected?"	1
"I	1
do	1
assure	1
you,	1
upon	1
my	1
honour,	1
I	1
never,	1
indirectly,	1
spoke	1
to	1
Dr.	1
Middleton	1
about	1
the	1
playhouse."	1
"Then,"	1
said	1
Archer,	1
"I'm	1
as	1
glad	1
as	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
found	1
a	1
thousand	1
pounds!	1
Now	1
you	1
are	1
my	1
friend	1
indeed."	1
"And	1
Dr.	1
Middleton--why	1
should	1
you	1
suspect	1
him	1
without	1
reason	1
any	1
more	1
than	1
me?"	1
"As	1
to	1
that,"	1
said	1
Archer,	1
"he	1
is	1
your	1
friend,	1
and	1
you	1
are	1
right	1
to	1
defend	1
him;	1
and	1
I	1
won't	1
say	1
another	1
word	1
against	1
him.	1
Will	1
that	1
satisfy	1
you?"	1
"Not	1
quite."	1
"Not	1
quite!	1
Then,	1
indeed	1
you	1
are	1
unreasonable!"	1
"No,"	1
replied	1
De	1
Grey;	1
"for	1
I	1
don't	1
wish	1
you	1
to	1
yield	1
out	1
of	1
friendship	1
to	1
me,	1
any	1
more	1
than	1
to	1
honour.	1
If	1
you	1
yield	1
to	1
reason,	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
governed	1
by	1
reason	1
another	1
time."	1
"Well;	1
but	1
then	1
don't	1
triumph	1
over	1
me,	1
because	1
you	1
have	1
the	1
best	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
argument."	1
"Not	1
I!	1
How	1
can	1
I?"	1
said	1
De	1
Grey;	1
"for	1
now	1
you	1
are	1
on	1
THE	1
BEST	1
SIDE	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
myself,	1
are	1
not	1
you?	1
So	1
we	1
may	1
triumph	1
together."	1
"You	1
are	1
a	1
good	1
friend!"	1
said	1
Archer;	1
and	1
with	1
great	1
eagerness	1
he	1
pulled	1
down	1
the	1
fortifications,	1
whilst	1
every	1
hand	1
assisted.	1
The	1
room	1
was	1
restored	1
to	1
order	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
minutes--the	1
shutters	1
were	1
thrown	1
open,	1
the	1
cheerful	1
light	1
let	1
in.	1
The	1
windows	1
were	1
thrown	1
up,	1
and	1
the	1
first	1
feeling	1
of	1
the	1
fresh	1
air	1
was	1
delightful.	1
The	1
green	1
playgound	1
opened	1
before	1
them,	1
and	1
the	1
hopes	1
of	1
exercise	1
and	1
liberty	1
brightened	1
the	1
countenances	1
of	1
these	1
voluntary	1
prisoners.	1
But,	1
alas!	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
yet	1
at	1
liberty.	1
The	1
idea	1
of	1
Dr.	1
Middleton,	1
and	1
the	1
dread	1
of	1
his	1
vengeance,	1
smote	1
their	1
hearts.	1
When	1
the	1
rebels	1
had	1
sent	1
an	1
ambassador	1
with	1
their	1
surrender,	1
they	1
stood	1
in	1
pale	1
and	1
silent	1
suspense,	1
waiting	1
for	1
their	1
doom.	1
"Ah!"	1
said	1
Fisher,	1
looking	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
broken	1
panes	1
in	1
the	1
windows,	1
"the	1
doctor	1
will	1
think	1
the	1
most	1
of	1
THAT--he'll	1
never	1
forgive	1
us	1
for	1
that."	1
"Hush!	1
here	1
he	1
comes!"	1
His	1
steady	1
step	1
was	1
heard	1
approaching	1
nearer	1
and	1
nearer.	1
Archer	1
threw	1
open	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
Dr.	1
Middleton	1
entered.	1
Fisher	1
instantly	1
fell	1
on	1
his	1
knees.	1
"It	1
is	1
no	1
delight	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
see	1
people	1
on	1
their	1
knees.	1
Stand	1
up,	1
Mr.	1
Fisher.	1
I	1
hope	1
you	1
are	1
all	1
conscious	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
done	1
wrong?"	1
"Sir,"	1
said	1
Archer,	1
"they	1
are	1
conscious	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
done	1
wrong,	1
and	1
so	1
am	1
I.	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
ringleader.	1
Punish	1
me	1
as	1
you	1
think	1
proper.	1
I	1
submit.	1
Your	1
punishments--your	1
vengeance	1
ought	1
to	1
fall	1
on	1
me	1
alone!"	1
"Sir,"	1
said	1
Dr.	1
Middleton,	1
calmly,	1
"I	1
perceive	1
that	1
whatever	1
else	1
you	1
may	1
have	1
learned	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
your	1
education,	1
you	1
have	1
not	1
been	1
taught	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
the	1
word	1
punishment.	1
Punishment	1
and	1
vengeance	1
do	1
not	1
with	1
us	1
mean	1
the	1
same	1
thing.	1
PUNISHMENT	1
is	1
pain	1
given,	1
with	1
the	1
reasonable	1
hope	1
of	1
preventing	1
those	1
on	1
whom	1
it	1
is	1
inflicted	1
from	1
doing,	1
IN	1
FUTURE,	1
what	1
will	1
hurt	1
themselves	1
or	1
others.	1
VENGEANCE	1
never	1
looks	1
to	1
the	1
FUTURE,	1
but	1
is	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
anger	1
for	1
an	1
injury	1
that	1
is	1
past.	1
I	1
feel	1
no	1
anger;	1
you	1
have	1
done	1
me	1
no	1
injury."	1
Here	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
boys	1
looked	1
timidly	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
windows.	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
see	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
broken	1
my	1
windows;	1
that	1
is	1
a	1
small	1
evil."	1
"Oh,	1
sir!	1
How	1
good!	1
How	1
merciful!"	1
exclaimed	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
most	1
panic-struck.	1
"He	1
forgives	1
us!"	1
"Stay,"	1
resumed	1
Dr.	1
Middleton;	1
"I	1
cannot	1
forgive	1
you.	1
I	1
shall	1
never	1
revenge,	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
my	1
duty	1
to	1
punish.	1
You	1
have	1
rebelled	1
against	1
the	1
just	1
authority	1
which	1
is	1
necessary	1
to	1
conduct	1
and	1
govern	1
you	1
whilst	1
you	1
have	1
not	1
sufficient	1
reason	1
to	1
govern	1
and	1
conduct	1
yourselves.	1
Without	1
obedience	1
to	1
the	1
laws,"	1
added	1
he,	1
turning	1
to	1
Archer,	1
"as	1
men,	1
you	1
cannot	1
be	1
suffered	1
in	1
society.	1
You,	1
sir,	1
think	1
yourself	1
a	1
man,	1
I	1
observe;	1
and	1
you	1
think	1
it	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
not	1
to	1
submit	1
to	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
another.	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
pleasure	1
in	1
making	1
others,	1
whether	1
men	1
or	1
children,	1
submit	1
to	1
my	1
WILL;	1
but	1
my	1
reason	1
and	1
experience	1
are	1
superior	1
to	1
yours.	1
Your	1
parents	1
at	1
least	1
think	1
so,	1
or	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
intrusted	1
me	1
with	1
the	1
care	1
of	1
your	1
education.	1
As	1
long	1
as	1
they	1
do	1
intrust	1
you	1
to	1
my	1
care,	1
and	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
any	1
hopes	1
of	1
making	1
you	1
wiser	1
and	1
better	1
by	1
punishment,	1
I	1
shall	1
steadily	1
inflict	1
it,	1
whenever	1
I	1
judge	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
necessary,	1
and	1
I	1
judge	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
necessary	1
NOW.	1
This	1
is	1
a	1
long	1
sermon,	1
Mr.	1
Archer,	1
not	1
preached	1
to	1
show	1
my	1
own	1
eloquence,	1
but	1
to	1
convince	1
your	1
understanding.	1
Now,	1
as	1
to	1
your	1
punishment!"	1
"Name	1
it,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
Archer;	1
"whatever	1
it	1
is,	1
I	1
will	1
cheerfully	1
submit	1
to	1
it."	1
"Name	1
it	1
yourself,"	1
said	1
Dr.	1
Middleton,	1
"and	1
show	1
me	1
that	1
you	1
now	1
understand	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
punishment."	1
Archer,	1
proud	1
to	1
be	1
treated	1
like	1
a	1
reasonable	1
creature,	1
and	1
sorry	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
behaved	1
like	1
a	1
foolish	1
schoolboy,	1
was	1
silent	1
for	1
some	1
time,	1
but	1
at	1
length	1
replied,	1
"That	1
he	1
would	1
rather	1
not	1
name	1
his	1
own	1
punishment."	1
He	1
repeated,	1
however,	1
that	1
he	1
trusted	1
he	1
should	1
bear	1
it	1
well,	1
whatever	1
it	1
might	1
be.	1
"I	1
shall,	1
then,"	1
said	1
Dr.	1
Middleton,	1
"deprive	1
you,	1
for	1
two	1
months,	1
of	1
pocket-money,	1
as	1
you	1
have	1
had	1
too	1
much,	1
and	1
have	1
made	1
a	1
bad	1
use	1
of	1
it."	1
"Sir,"	1
said	1
Archer,	1
"I	1
brought	1
five	1
guineas	1
with	1
me	1
to	1
school.	1
This	1
guinea	1
is	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
left."	1
Dr.	1
Middleton	1
received	1
the	1
guinea	1
which	1
Archer	1
offered	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
approbation,	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
applied	1
to	1
the	1
repairs	1
of	1
the	1
schoolroom.	1
The	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
boys	1
waited	1
in	1
silence	1
for	1
the	1
doctor's	1
sentence	1
against	1
them,	1
but	1
not	1
with	1
those	1
looks	1
of	1
abject	1
fear	1
with	1
which	1
boys	1
usually	1
expect	1
the	1
sentence	1
of	1
a	1
schoolmaster.	1
"You	1
shall	1
return	1
from	1
the	1
playground,	1
all	1
of	1
you,"	1
said	1
Dr.	1
Middleton,	1
"one	1
quarter	1
of	1
an	1
hour	1
sooner,	1
for	1
two	1
months	1
to	1
come,	1
than	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
your	1
companions.	1
A	1
bell	1
shall	1
ring	1
at	1
the	1
appointed	1
time.	1
I	1
give	1
you	1
an	1
opportunity	1
of	1
recovering	1
my	1
confidence	1
by	1
your	1
punctuality."	1
"Oh,	1
sir!	1
we	1
will	1
come	1
the	1
instant,	1
the	1
very	1
instant	1
the	1
bell	1
rings;	1
you	1
shall	1
have	1
confidence	1
in	1
us,"	1
cried	1
they,	1
eagerly.	1
"I	1
deserve	1
your	1
confidence,	1
I	1
hope,"	1
said	1
Dr.	1
Middleton;	1
"for	1
it	1
is	1
my	1
first	1
wish	1
to	1
make	1
you	1
all	1
happy.	1
You	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
the	1
pain	1
that	1
it	1
has	1
cost	1
me	1
to	1
deprive	1
you	1
of	1
food	1
for	1
so	1
many	1
hours."	1
Here	1
the	1
boys,	1
with	1
one	1
accord,	1
ran	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
they	1
had	1
deposited	1
their	1
last	1
supplies.	1
Archer	1
delivered	1
them	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
doctor,	1
proud	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
reduced	1
to	1
obedience	1
merely	1
by	1
necessity.	1
"The	1
reason,"	1
resumed	1
Dr.	1
Middleton,	1
having	1
now	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
usual	1
benignity	1
of	1
his	1
manner--"the	1
reason	1
why	1
I	1
desired	1
that	1
none	1
of	1
you	1
should	1
go	1
to	1
that	1
building,"	1
pointing	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window,	1
"was	1
this:--I	1
had	1
been	1
informed	1
that	1
a	1
gang	1
of	1
gipsies	1
had	1
slept	1
there	1
the	1
night	1
before	1
I	1
spoke	1
to	1
you,	1
one	1
of	1
whom	1
was	1
dangerously	1
ill	1
of	1
a	1
putrid	1
fever.	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
choose	1
to	1
mention	1
my	1
reason	1
to	1
you	1
or	1
your	1
friends.	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
the	1
place	1
cleaned,	1
and	1
you	1
may	1
return	1
to	1
it	1
when	1
you	1
please.	1
The	1
gipsies	1
were	1
yesterday	1
removed	1
from	1
the	1
town."	1
"De	1
Grey,	1
you	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
right,"	1
whispered	1
Archer,	1
"and	1
it	1
was	1
I	1
that	1
was	1
UNJUST."	1
"The	1
old	1
woman,"	1
continued	1
the	1
doctor,	1
"whom	1
you	1
employed	1
to	1
buy	1
food,	1
has	1
escaped	1
the	1
fever,	1
but	1
she	1
has	1
not	1
escaped	1
a	1
gaol,	1
whither	1
she	1
was	1
sent	1
yesterday,	1
for	1
having	1
defrauded	1
you	1
of	1
your	1
money.	1
"Mr.	1
Fisher,"	1
said	1
Dr.	1
Middleton,	1
"as	1
to	1
you,	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
punish	1
you;	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
hope	1
of	1
making	1
you	1
either	1
wiser	1
or	1
better.	1
Do	1
you	1
know	1
this	1
paper?"--the	1
paper	1
appeared	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
bill	1
for	1
candles	1
and	1
a	1
tinder-box.	1
"I	1
desired	1
him	1
to	1
buy	1
those	1
things,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
Archer,	1
colouring.	1
"And	1
did	1
you	1
desire	1
him	1
not	1
to	1
pay	1
for	1
them?"	1
"No,"	1
said	1
Archer,	1
"he	1
had	1
half	1
a	1
crown	1
on	1
purpose	1
to	1
pay	1
for	1
them."	1
"I	1
know	1
he	1
had,	1
but	1
he	1
chose	1
to	1
apply	1
it	1
to	1
his	1
private	1
use,	1
and	1
gave	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
gipsy	1
to	1
buy	1
twelve	1
buns	1
for	1
his	1
own	1
eating.	1
To	1
obtain	1
credit	1
for	1
the	1
tinder-box	1
and	1
candles,	1
he	1
made	1
use	1
of	1
THIS	1
name,"	1
said	1
he,	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
bill,	1
and	1
pointing	1
to	1
De	1
Grey's	1
name,	1
which	1
was	1
written	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
a	1
copy	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
De	1
Grey's	1
exercises.	1
"I	1
assure	1
you,	1
sir--"	1
cried	1
Archer.	1
"You	1
need	1
not	1
assure	1
me,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
Dr.	1
Middleton;	1
"I	1
cannot	1
suspect	1
a	1
boy	1
of	1
your	1
temper	1
of	1
having	1
any	1
part	1
in	1
so	1
base	1
an	1
action.	1
When	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
shop	1
refused	1
to	1
let	1
Mr.	1
Fisher	1
have	1
the	1
things	1
without	1
paying	1
for	1
them,	1
he	1
made	1
use	1
of	1
De	1
Grey's	1
name,	1
who	1
was	1
known	1
there.	1
Suspecting	1
some	1
mischief,	1
however,	1
from	1
the	1
purchase	1
of	1
the	1
tinder-box,	1
the	1
shopkeeper	1
informed	1
me	1
of	1
the	1
circumstance.	1
Nothing	1
in	1
this	1
whole	1
business	1
gave	1
me	1
half	1
so	1
much	1
pain	1
as	1
I	1
felt,	1
for	1
a	1
moment,	1
when	1
I	1
suspected	1
that	1
De	1
Grey	1
was	1
concerned	1
in	1
it."	1
A	1
loud	1
cry,	1
in	1
which	1
Archer's	1
voice	1
was	1
heard	1
most	1
distinctly,	1
declared	1
De	1
Grey's	1
innocence.	1
Dr.	1
Middleton	1
looked	1
round	1
at	1
their	1
eager,	1
honest	1
faces,	1
with	1
benevolent	1
approbation.	1
"Archer,"	1
said	1
he,	1
taking	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
hand,	1
"I	1
am	1
heartily	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
got	1
the	1
better	1
of	1
your	1
party	1
spirit.	1
I	1
wish	1
you	1
may	1
keep	1
such	1
a	1
friend	1
as	1
you	1
have	1
now	1
beside	1
you;	1
one	1
such	1
friend	1
is	1
worth	1
two	1
such	1
parties.	1
As	1
for	1
you,	1
Mr.	1
Fisher,	1
depart;	1
you	1
must	1
never	1
return	1
hither	1
again."	1
In	1
vain	1
he	1
solicited	1
Archer	1
and	1
De	1
Grey	1
to	1
intercede	1
for	1
him.	1
Everybody	1
turned	1
away	1
with	1
contempt;	1
and	1
he	1
sneaked	1
out,	1
whimpering	1
in	1
a	1
doleful	1
voice,	1
"What	1
shall	1
I	1
say	1
to	1
my	1
Aunt	1
Barbara?"	1
THE	1
BRACELETS.	1
In	1
a	1
beautiful	1
and	1
retired	1
part	1
of	1
England	1
lived	1
Mrs.	1
Villars,	1
a	1
lady	1
whose	1
accurate	1
understanding,	1
benevolent	1
heart,	1
and	1
steady	1
temper	1
peculiarly	1
fitted	1
her	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
difficult,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
most	1
important,	1
of	1
all	1
occupations--the	1
education	1
of	1
youth.	1
This	1
task	1
she	1
had	1
undertaken;	1
and	1
twenty	1
young	1
persons	1
were	1
put	1
under	1
her	1
care,	1
with	1
the	1
perfect	1
confidence	1
of	1
their	1
parents.	1
No	1
young	1
people	1
could	1
be	1
happier;	1
they	1
were	1
good	1
and	1
gay,	1
emulous,	1
but	1
not	1
envious	1
of	1
each	1
other;	1
for	1
Mrs.	1
Villars	1
was	1
impartially	1
just;	1
her	1
praise	1
they	1
felt	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
reward	1
of	1
merit,	1
and	1
her	1
blame	1
they	1
knew	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
necessary	1
consequence	1
of	1
ill-	1
conduct.	1
To	1
the	1
one,	1
therefore,	1
they	1
patiently	1
submitted,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
other	1
consciously	1
rejoiced.	1
They	1
rose	1
with	1
fresh	1
cheerfulness	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
eager	1
to	1
pursue	1
their	1
various	1
occupations.	1
They	1
returned	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
with	1
renewed	1
ardour	1
to	1
their	1
amusements,	1
and	1
retired	1
to	1
rest	1
satisfied	1
with	1
themselves	1
and	1
pleased	1
with	1
each	1
other.	1
Nothing	1
so	1
much	1
contributed	1
to	1
preserve	1
a	1
spirit	1
of	1
emulation	1
in	1
this	1
little	1
society	1
as	1
a	1
small	1
honorary	1
distinction,	1
given	1
annually,	1
as	1
a	1
prize	1
of	1
successful	1
application.	1
The	1
prize	1
this	1
year	1
was	1
peculiarly	1
dear	1
to	1
each	1
individual,	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
picture	1
of	1
a	1
friend	1
whom	1
they	1
dearly	1
loved.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
picture	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
Villars	1
in	1
a	1
small	1
bracelet.	1
It	1
wanted	1
neither	1
gold,	1
pearls	1
nor	1
precious	1
stones	1
to	1
give	1
it	1
value.	1
The	1
two	1
foremost	1
candidates	1
for	1
this	1
prize	1
were	1
Cecilia	1
and	1
Leonora.	1
Cecilia	1
was	1
the	1
most	1
intimate	1
friend	1
of	1
Leonora;	1
but	1
Leonora	1
was	1
only	1
the	1
favourite	1
companion	1
of	1
Cecilia.	1
Cecilia	1
was	1
of	1
an	1
active,	1
ambitious,	1
enterprising	1
disposition,	1
more	1
eager	1
in	1
the	1
pursuit	1
than	1
happy	1
in	1
the	1
enjoyment	1
of	1
her	1
wishes.	1
Leonora	1
was	1
of	1
a	1
contented,	1
unaspiring	1
temperate	1
character;	1
not	1
easily	1
roused	1
to	1
action,	1
but	1
indefatigable	1
when	1
once	1
excited.	1
Leonora	1
was	1
proud;	1
Cecilia	1
was	1
vain.	1
Her	1
vanity	1
made	1
her	1
more	1
dependent	1
upon	1
the	1
approbation	1
of	1
others,	1
and	1
therefore	1
more	1
anxious	1
to	1
please	1
than	1
Leonora;	1
but	1
that	1
very	1
vanity	1
made	1
her,	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
more	1
apt	1
to	1
offend.	1
In	1
short,	1
Leonora	1
was	1
the	1
most	1
anxious	1
to	1
avoid	1
what	1
was	1
wrong;	1
Cecilia,	1
the	1
most	1
ambitious	1
to	1
do	1
what	1
was	1
right.	1
Few	1
of	1
her	1
companions	1
loved,	1
but	1
many	1
were	1
led	1
by	1
Cecilia,	1
for	1
she	1
was	1
often	1
successful.	1
Many	1
loved	1
Leonora,	1
but	1
none	1
were	1
ever	1
governed	1
by	1
her,	1
for	1
she	1
was	1
too	1
indolent	1
to	1
govern.	1
On	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
of	1
May,	1
about	1
six	1
o'clock	1
in	1
the	1
evening,	1
a	1
great	1
bell	1
rang,	1
to	1
summon	1
this	1
little	1
society	1
into	1
a	1
hall,	1
where	1
the	1
prize	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
decided.	1
A	1
number	1
of	1
small	1
tables	1
were	1
placed	1
in	1
a	1
circle	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
hall.	1
Seats	1
for	1
the	1
young	1
competitors	1
were	1
raised	1
one	1
above	1
another,	1
in	1
a	1
semicircle,	1
some	1
yards	1
distant	1
from	1
the	1
table,	1
and	1
the	1
judges'	1
chairs,	1
under	1
canopies	1
of	1
lilacs	1
and	1
laburnums,	1
forming	1
another	1
semicircle,	1
closed	1
the	1
amphitheatre.	1
Everyone	1
put	1
their	1
writings,	1
their	1
drawings,	1
their	1
works	1
of	1
various	1
kinds	1
upon	1
the	1
tables	1
appropriated	1
for	1
each.	1
How	1
unsteady	1
were	1
the	1
last	1
steps	1
to	1
these	1
tables!	1
How	1
each	1
little	1
hand	1
trembled	1
as	1
it	1
laid	1
down	1
its	1
claims!	1
Till	1
this	1
moment	1
everyone	1
thought	1
herself	1
secure	1
of	1
success;	1
and	1
the	1
heart,	1
which	1
exulted	1
with	1
hope,	1
now	1
palpitated	1
with	1
fear.	1
The	1
works	1
were	1
examined,	1
the	1
preference	1
adjudged,	1
and	1
the	1
prize	1
was	1
declared	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
happy	1
Cecilia's.	1
Mrs.	1
Villars	1
came	1
forward,	1
smiling,	1
with	1
the	1
bracelet	1
in	1
her	1
hand.	1
Cecilia	1
was	1
behind	1
her	1
companions,	1
on	1
the	1
highest	1
row.	1
All	1
the	1
others	1
gave	1
way,	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
floor	1
in	1
an	1
instant.	1
Mrs.	1
Villars	1
clasped	1
the	1
bracelet	1
on	1
her	1
arm;	1
the	1
clasp	1
was	1
heard	1
through	1
the	1
whole	1
hall,	1
and	1
a	1
universal	1
smile	1
of	1
congratulation	1
followed.	1
Mrs.	1
Villars	1
kissed	1
Cecilia's	1
little	1
hand.	1
"And	1
now,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"go	1
and	1
rejoice	1
with	1
your	1
companions;	1
the	1
remainder	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
is	1
yours."	1
Oh!	1
you	1
whose	1
hearts	1
are	1
elated	1
with	1
success,	1
whose	1
bosoms	1
beat	1
high	1
with	1
joy	1
in	1
the	1
moment	1
of	1
triumph,	1
command	1
yourselves.	1
Let	1
that	1
triumph	1
be	1
moderate,	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
lasting.	1
Consider,	1
that	1
though	1
you	1
are	1
good,	1
you	1
may	1
be	1
better;	1
and,	1
though	1
wise,	1
you	1
may	1
be	1
weak.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
Mrs.	1
Villars	1
had	1
given	1
her	1
the	1
bracelet,	1
all	1
Cecilia's	1
little	1
companions	1
crowded	1
round	1
her,	1
and	1
they	1
all	1
left	1
the	1
hall	1
in	1
an	1
instant.	1
She	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
spirits	1
and	1
vanity.	1
She	1
ran	1
on.	1
Running	1
down	1
the	1
flight	1
of	1
steps	1
which	1
led	1
to	1
the	1
garden,	1
in	1
her	1
violent	1
haste,	1
Cecilia	1
threw	1
down	1
the	1
little	1
Louisa,	1
who	1
had	1
a	1
china	1
mandarin	1
in	1
her	1
hand,	1
which	1
her	1
mother	1
had	1
sent	1
her	1
that	1
very	1
morning,	1
and	1
which	1
was	1
all	1
broken	1
to	1
pieces	1
by	1
her	1
fall.	1
"Oh,	1
my	1
mandarin!"	1
cried	1
Louisa,	1
bursting	1
into	1
tears.	1
The	1
crowd	1
behind	1
Cecilia	1
suddenly	1
stopped.	1
Louisa	1
sat	1
on	1
the	1
lowest	1
step,	1
fixing	1
her	1
eyes	1
upon	1
the	1
broken	1
pieces.	1
Then,	1
turning	1
round,	1
she	1
hid	1
her	1
face	1
in	1
her	1
hands	1
upon	1
the	1
step	1
above	1
her.	1
In	1
turning,	1
Louisa	1
threw	1
down	1
the	1
remains	1
of	1
the	1
mandarin.	1
The	1
head,	1
which	1
she	1
placed	1
in	1
the	1
socket,	1
fell	1
from	1
the	1
shoulders,	1
and	1
rolled,	1
bounding	1
along	1
the	1
gravel	1
walk.	1
Cecilia	1
pointed	1
to	1
the	1
head	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
socket,	1
and	1
burst	1
into	1
laughter.	1
The	1
crowd	1
behind	1
laughed,	1
too.	1
At	1
any	1
other	1
time	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
more	1
inclined	1
to	1
cry	1
with	1
Louisa;	1
but	1
Cecilia	1
had	1
just	1
been	1
successful,	1
and	1
sympathy	1
with	1
the	1
victorious	1
often	1
makes	1
us	1
forget	1
justice.	1
Leonora,	1
however,	1
preserved	1
her	1
usual	1
consistency.	1
"Poor	1
Louisa!"	1
said	1
she,	1
looking	1
first	1
at	1
her,	1
and	1
then	1
reproachfully	1
at	1
Cecilia.	1
Cecilia	1
turned	1
sharply	1
round,	1
colouring,	1
half	1
with	1
shame	1
and	1
half	1
with	1
vexation.	1
"I	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
it,	1
Leonora,"	1
said	1
she.	1
"But	1
you	1
could	1
have	1
helped	1
laughing,	1
Cecilia."	1
"I	1
didn't	1
laugh	1
at	1
Louisa;	1
and	1
I	1
surely	1
may	1
laugh,	1
for	1
it	1
does	1
nobody	1
any	1
harm."	1
"I	1
am	1
sure,	1
however,"	1
replied	1
Leonora,	1
"I	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
laughed	1
if	1
I	1
had--"	1
"No,	1
to	1
be	1
sure,	1
you	1
wouldn't,	1
because	1
Louisa	1
is	1
your	1
favourite.	1
I	1
can	1
buy	1
her	1
another	1
mandarin	1
when	1
the	1
old	1
peddler	1
comes	1
to	1
the	1
door,	1
if	1
that's	1
all.	1
I	1
CAN	1
do	1
no	1
more,	1
CAN	1
I?"	1
said	1
she,	1
again	1
turning	1
round	1
to	1
her	1
companions.	1
"No,	1
to	1
be	1
sure,"	1
said	1
they;	1
"that's	1
all	1
fair."	1
Cecilia	1
looked	1
triumphantly	1
at	1
Leonora.	1
Leonora	1
let	1
go	1
her	1
hand;	1
she	1
ran	1
on,	1
and	1
the	1
crowd	1
followed.	1
When	1
she	1
got	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
garden,	1
she	1
turned	1
round	1
to	1
see	1
if	1
Leonora	1
had	1
followed	1
her,	1
too;	1
but	1
was	1
vexed	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
still	1
sitting	1
on	1
the	1
steps	1
with	1
Louisa.	1
"I'm	1
sure	1
I	1
can	1
do	1
no	1
more	1
than	1
buy	1
her	1
another,	1
CAN	1
I!"	1
said	1
she,	1
again	1
appealing	1
to	1
her	1
companions.	1
"No,	1
to	1
be	1
sure,"	1
said	1
they,	1
eager	1
to	1
begin	1
their	1
play.	1
How	1
many	1
games	1
did	1
these	1
juvenile	1
playmates	1
begin	1
and	1
leave	1
off,	1
before	1
Cecilia	1
could	1
be	1
satisfied	1
with	1
any!	1
Her	1
thoughts	1
were	1
discomposed,	1
and	1
her	1
mind	1
was	1
running	1
upon	1
something	1
else.	1
No	1
wonder,	1
then,	1
that	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
play	1
with	1
her	1
usual	1
address.	1
She	1
grew	1
still	1
more	1
impatient.	1
She	1
threw	1
down	1
the	1
ninepins.	1
"Come,	1
let	1
us	1
play	1
at	1
something	1
else--at	1
threading	1
the	1
needle,"	1
said	1
she,	1
holding	1
out	1
her	1
hand.	1
They	1
all	1
yielded	1
to	1
the	1
hand	1
which	1
wore	1
the	1
bracelet.	1
But	1
Cecilia,	1
dissatisfied	1
with	1
herself,	1
was	1
discontented	1
with	1
everybody	1
else.	1
Her	1
tone	1
grew	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
peremptory.	1
One	1
was	1
too	1
rude,	1
another	1
too	1
stiff;	1
one	1
too	1
slow,	1
another	1
too	1
quick;	1
in	1
short	1
everything	1
went	1
wrong,	1
and	1
everybody	1
was	1
tired	1
of	1
her	1
humours.	1
The	1
triumph	1
of	1
SUCCESS	1
is	1
absolute,	1
but	1
short.	1
Cecilia's	1
companions	1
at	1
length	1
recollected	1
that	1
though	1
she	1
had	1
embroidered	1
a	1
tulip,	1
and	1
painted	1
a	1
peach,	1
better	1
than	1
they,	1
yet	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
play	1
as	1
well,	1
and	1
keep	1
their	1
tempers	1
better;	1
for	1
she	1
was	1
discomposed.	1
Walking	1
towards	1
the	1
house	1
in	1
a	1
peevish	1
mood,	1
Cecilia	1
met	1
Leonora,	1
but	1
passed	1
on.	1
"Cecilia!"	1
cried	1
Leonora.	1
"Well,	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
want	1
with	1
me?"	1
"Are	1
we	1
friends?"	1
"You	1
know	1
best,"	1
said	1
Cecilia.	1
"We	1
are,	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
let	1
me	1
tell	1
Louisa	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
sorry--"	1
Cecilia,	1
interrupting	1
her,	1
"Oh,	1
pray	1
let	1
me	1
hear	1
no	1
more	1
about	1
Louisa!"	1
"What!	1
not	1
confess	1
that	1
you	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
wrong?	1
Oh,	1
Cecilia!	1
I	1
had	1
a	1
better	1
opinion	1
of	1
you."	1
"Your	1
opinion	1
is	1
of	1
no	1
consequence	1
to	1
me	1
now,	1
for	1
you	1
don't	1
love	1
me."	1
"No;	1
not	1
when	1
you	1
are	1
unjust,	1
Cecilia."	1
"Unjust!	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
unjust;	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
were,	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
my	1
governess."	1
"No,	1
but	1
am	1
not	1
I	1
your	1
friend?"	1
"I	1
don't	1
desire	1
to	1
have	1
such	1
a	1
friend,	1
who	1
would	1
quarrel	1
with	1
me	1
for	1
happening	1
to	1
throw	1
down	1
little	1
Louisa.	1
How	1
could	1
I	1
tell	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
a	1
mandarin	1
in	1
her	1
hand?	1
and	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
broken,	1
could	1
I	1
do	1
more	1
than	1
promise	1
her	1
another;	1
was	1
that	1
unjust?"	1
"But	1
you	1
know,	1
Cecilia--"	1
"I	1
KNOW,"	1
ironically.	1
"I	1
know,	1
Leonora,	1
that	1
you	1
love	1
Louisa	1
better	1
than	1
you	1
love	1
me;	1
that's	1
the	1
injustice!"	1
"If	1
I	1
did,"	1
replied	1
Leonora,	1
gravely,	1
"it	1
would	1
be	1
no	1
injustice,	1
if	1
she	1
deserved	1
it	1
better."	1
"How	1
can	1
you	1
compare	1
Louisa	1
to	1
me!"	1
exclaimed	1
Cecilia,	1
indignantly.	1
Leonora	1
made	1
no	1
answer;	1
for	1
she	1
was	1
really	1
hurt	1
at	1
her	1
friend's	1
conduct.	1
She	1
walked	1
on	1
to	1
join	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
her	1
companions.	1
They	1
were	1
dancing	1
in	1
a	1
round	1
upon	1
the	1
grass.	1
Leonora	1
declined	1
dancing;	1
but	1
they	1
prevailed	1
upon	1
her	1
to	1
sing	1
for	1
them.	1
Her	1
voice	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
sprightly,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
sweeter	1
than	1
usual.	1
Who	1
sang	1
so	1
sweetly	1
as	1
Leonora?	1
or	1
who	1
danced	1
so	1
nimbly	1
as	1
Louisa?	1
Away	1
she	1
was	1
flying,	1
all	1
spirits	1
and	1
gaiety,	1
when	1
Leonora's	1
eyes	1
full	1
of	1
tears,	1
caught	1
hers.	1
Louisa	1
silently	1
let	1
go	1
her	1
companion's	1
hand,	1
and,	1
quitting	1
the	1
dance,	1
ran	1
up	1
to	1
Leonora	1
to	1
inquire	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
her.	1
"Nothing,"	1
replied	1
she,	1
"that	1
need	1
interrupt	1
you.	1
Go,	1
my	1
dear;	1
go	1
and	1
dance	1
again."	1
Louisa	1
immediately	1
ran	1
away	1
to	1
her	1
garden,	1
and	1
pulling	1
off	1
her	1
little	1
straw	1
hat,	1
she	1
lined	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
freshest	1
strawberry-leaves,	1
and	1
was	1
upon	1
her	1
knees	1
before	1
the	1
strawberry-bed	1
when	1
Cecilia	1
came	1
by.	1
Cecilia	1
was	1
not	1
disposed	1
to	1
be	1
pleased	1
with	1
Louisa	1
at	1
that	1
instant,	1
for	1
two	1
reasons;	1
because	1
she	1
was	1
jealous	1
of	1
her,	1
and	1
because	1
she	1
had	1
injured	1
her.	1
The	1
injury,	1
however,	1
Louisa	1
had	1
already	1
forgotten.	1
Perhaps	1
to	1
tell	1
things	1
just	1
as	1
they	1
were,	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
quite	1
so	1
much	1
inclined	1
to	1
kiss	1
Cecilia	1
as	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
before	1
the	1
fall	1
of	1
her	1
mandarin;	1
but	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
utmost	1
extent	1
of	1
her	1
malice,	1
if	1
it	1
can	1
be	1
called	1
malice.	1
"What	1
are	1
you	1
doing	1
there,	1
little	1
one?"	1
said	1
Cecilia,	1
in	1
a	1
sharp	1
tone.	1
"Are	1
you	1
eating	1
your	1
early	1
strawberries	1
here	1
all	1
alone?"	1
"No,"	1
said	1
Louisa,	1
mysteriously,	1
"I	1
am	1
not	1
eating	1
them."	1
"What	1
are	1
you	1
doing	1
with	1
them?	1
can't	1
you	1
answer,	1
then?	1
I'm	1
not	1
playing	1
with	1
you,	1
child!"	1
"Oh,	1
as	1
to	1
that,	1
Cecilia,	1
you	1
know	1
I	1
need	1
not	1
answer	1
you	1
unless	1
I	1
choose	1
it;	1
not	1
but	1
what	1
I	1
would	1
if	1
you	1
would	1
only	1
ask	1
me	1
civilly,	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
call	1
me	1
CHILD."	1
"Why	1
should	1
not	1
I	1
call	1
you	1
child?"	1
"Because--because--I	1
don't	1
know;	1
but	1
I	1
wish	1
you	1
would	1
stand	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
light,	1
Cecilia,	1
for	1
you	1
are	1
trampling	1
upon	1
all	1
my	1
strawberries."	1
"I	1
have	1
not	1
touched	1
one,	1
you	1
covetous	1
little	1
creature!"	1
"Indeed--indeed,	1
Cecilia,	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
covetous.	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
eaten	1
one	1
of	1
them;	1
they	1
are	1
all	1
for	1
your	1
friend	1
Leonora.	1
See	1
how	1
unjust	1
you	1
are!"	1
"Unjust!	1
that's	1
a	1
cant	1
word	1
which	1
you	1
learnt	1
of	1
my	1
friend	1
Leonora,	1
as	1
you	1
call	1
her;	1
but	1
she	1
is	1
not	1
my	1
friend	1
now."	1
"Not	1
your	1
friend	1
now!"	1
exclaimed	1
Louisa;	1
"then	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
you	1
must	1
have	1
done	1
something	1
VERY	1
naughty."	1
"How?"	1
cried	1
Cecilia,	1
catching	1
hold	1
of	1
her.	1
"Let	1
me	1
go,	1
let	1
me	1
go!"	1
cried	1
Louisa,	1
struggling.	1
"I	1
won't	1
give	1
you	1
one	1
of	1
my	1
strawberries,	1
for	1
I	1
don't	1
like	1
you	1
at	1
all!"	1
"You	1
don't,	1
don't	1
you?"	1
cried	1
Cecilia,	1
provoked,	1
and,	1
catching	1
the	1
hat	1
from	1
Louisa,	1
she	1
flung	1
the	1
strawberries	1
over	1
the	1
hedge.	1
"Will	1
nobody	1
help	1
me?"	1
exclaimed	1
Louisa,	1
snatching	1
her	1
hat	1
again,	1
and	1
running	1
away	1
with	1
all	1
her	1
force.	1
"What	1
have	1
I	1
done?"	1
said	1
Cecilia,	1
recollecting	1
herself;	1
"Louisa!	1
Louisa!"	1
she	1
called	1
very	1
loud,	1
but	1
Louisa	1
would	1
not	1
turn	1
back;	1
she	1
was	1
running	1
to	1
her	1
companions,	1
who	1
were	1
still	1
dancing,	1
hand	1
in	1
hand,	1
upon	1
the	1
grass,	1
whilst	1
Leonora,	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
middle,	1
was	1
singing	1
to	1
them.	1
"Stop!	1
stop!	1
and	1
hear	1
me!"	1
cried	1
Louisa,	1
breaking	1
through	1
them;	1
and,	1
rushing	1
up	1
to	1
Leonora,	1
she	1
threw	1
her	1
hat	1
at	1
her	1
feet,	1
and	1
panting	1
for	1
breath--"It	1
was	1
full--almost	1
full	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
strawberries,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"the	1
first	1
I	1
ever	1
got	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
garden.	1
They	1
should	1
all	1
have	1
been	1
for	1
you,	1
Leonora;	1
but	1
now	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
one	1
left.	1
They	1
are	1
all	1
gone!"	1
said	1
she;	1
and	1
she	1
hid	1
her	1
face	1
in	1
Leonora's	1
lap.	1
"Gone!	1
gone	1
where?"	1
said	1
everyone,	1
at	1
once	1
running	1
up	1
to	1
her.	1
"Cecilia!	1
Cecilia!"	1
said	1
she,	1
sobbing.	1
"Cecilia,"	1
repeated	1
Leonora,	1
"what	1
of	1
Cecilia?"	1
"Yes,	1
it	1
was--it	1
was."	1
"Come	1
with	1
me,"	1
said	1
Leonora,	1
unwilling	1
to	1
have	1
her	1
friend	1
exposed.	1
"Come,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
get	1
you	1
some	1
more	1
strawberries."	1
"Oh,	1
I	1
don't	1
mind	1
the	1
strawberries,	1
indeed;	1
but	1
I	1
wanted	1
to	1
have	1
had	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
giving	1
them	1
to	1
you."	1
Leonora	1
took	1
her	1
up	1
in	1
her	1
arms	1
to	1
carry	1
her	1
away,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
too	1
late.	1
"What,	1
Cecilia!	1
Cecilia,	1
who	1
won	1
the	1
prize!	1
It	1
could	1
not	1
surely	1
be	1
Cecilia,"	1
whispered	1
every	1
busy	1
tongue.	1
At	1
this	1
instant	1
the	1
bell	1
summoned	1
them	1
in.	1
"There	1
she	1
is!	1
There	1
she	1
is!"	1
cried	1
they,	1
pointing	1
to	1
an	1
arbour,	1
where	1
Cecilia	1
was	1
standing	1
ashamed	1
and	1
alone;	1
and,	1
as	1
they	1
passed	1
her,	1
some	1
lifted	1
up	1
their	1
hands	1
and	1
eyes	1
with	1
astonishment,	1
others	1
whispered	1
and	1
huddled	1
mysteriously	1
together,	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
avoid	1
her.	1
Leonora	1
walked	1
on,	1
her	1
head	1
a	1
little	1
higher	1
than	1
usual.	1
"Leonora!"	1
said	1
Cecilia,	1
timorously,	1
as	1
she	1
passed.	1
"Oh,	1
Cecilia!	1
who	1
would	1
have	1
thought	1
that	1
you	1
had	1
a	1
bad	1
heart?"	1
Cecilia	1
turned	1
her	1
head	1
aside	1
and	1
burst	1
into	1
tears.	1
"Oh,	1
no,	1
indeed,	1
she	1
has	1
not	1
a	1
bad	1
heart!"	1
cried	1
Louisa,	1
running	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
throwing	1
her	1
arms	1
around	1
her	1
neck.	1
"She's	1
very	1
sorry;	1
are	1
not	1
you,	1
Cecilia?	1
But	1
don't	1
cry	1
any	1
more,	1
for	1
I	1
forgive	1
you,	1
with	1
all	1
my	1
heart--and	1
I	1
love	1
you	1
now,	1
though	1
I	1
said	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
passion."	1
"Oh,	1
you	1
sweet-tempered	1
girl!	1
how	1
I	1
love	1
you!"	1
said	1
Cecilia,	1
kissing	1
her.	1
"Well,	1
then,	1
if	1
you	1
do,	1
come	1
along	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
dry	1
your	1
eyes,	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
so	1
red!"	1
"Go,	1
my	1
dear,	1
and	1
I'll	1
come	1
presently."	1
"Then	1
I	1
will	1
keep	1
a	1
place	1
for	1
you,	1
next	1
to	1
me;	1
but	1
you	1
must	1
make	1
haste,	1
or	1
you	1
will	1
have	1
to	1
come	1
in	1
when	1
we	1
have	1
all	1
sat	1
down	1
to	1
supper,	1
and	1
then	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
so	1
stared	1
at!	1
So	1
don't	1
stay,	1
now."	1
Cecilia	1
followed	1
Louisa	1
with	1
her	1
eyes	1
till	1
she	1
was	1
out	1
of	1
sight.	1
"And	1
is	1
Louisa,"	1
said	1
she,	1
to	1
herself,	1
"the	1
only	1
one	1
who	1
would	1
stop	1
to	1
pity	1
me?	1
Mrs.	1
Villars	1
told	1
me	1
that	1
this	1
day	1
should	1
be	1
mine.	1
She	1
little	1
thought	1
how	1
it	1
would	1
end!"	1
Saying	1
these	1
words,	1
Cecilia	1
threw	1
herself	1
down	1
upon	1
the	1
ground;	1
her	1
arm	1
leaned	1
upon	1
a	1
heap	1
of	1
turf	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
raised	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
which,	1
in	1
the	1
pride	1
and	1
gaiety	1
of	1
her	1
heart,	1
she	1
had	1
called	1
her	1
throne.	1
At	1
this	1
instant,	1
Mrs.	1
Villars	1
came	1
out	1
to	1
enjoy	1
the	1
serenity	1
of	1
the	1
evening,	1
and,	1
passing	1
by	1
the	1
arbour	1
where	1
Cecilia	1
lay,	1
she	1
started.	1
Cecilia	1
rose	1
hastily.	1
"Who	1
is	1
there?"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Villars.	1
"It	1
is	1
I,	1
madam."	1
"And	1
who	1
is	1
_I_?"	1
"Cecilia."	1
"Why,	1
what	1
keeps	1
you	1
here,	1
my	1
dear?	1
Where	1
are	1
your	1
companions?	1
This	1
is,	1
perhaps,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
happiest	1
days	1
of	1
your	1
life."	1
"Oh,	1
no,	1
madam,"	1
said	1
Cecilia,	1
hardly	1
able	1
to	1
repress	1
her	1
tears.	1
"Why,	1
my	1
dear,	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
matter?"	1
Cecilia	1
hesitated.	1
"Speak,	1
my	1
dear.	1
You	1
know	1
that	1
when	1
I	1
ask	1
you	1
to	1
tell	1
me	1
anything	1
as	1
your	1
friend,	1
I	1
never	1
punish	1
you	1
as	1
your	1
governess;	1
therefore	1
you	1
need	1
not	1
be	1
afraid	1
to	1
tell	1
me	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
matter."	1
"No,	1
madam,	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
afraid,	1
but	1
ashamed.	1
You	1
asked	1
me	1
why	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
with	1
my	1
companions.	1
Why,	1
madam,	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
all	1
left	1
me,	1
and--"	1
"And	1
what,	1
my	1
dear?"	1
"And	1
I	1
see	1
that	1
they	1
all	1
dislike	1
me;	1
and	1
yet	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
why	1
they	1
should,	1
for	1
I	1
take	1
as	1
much	1
pains	1
to	1
please	1
as	1
any	1
of	1
them.	1
All	1
my	1
masters	1
seem	1
satisfied	1
with	1
me;	1
and	1
you	1
yourself,	1
madam,	1
were	1
pleased	1
this	1
very	1
morning	1
to	1
give	1
me	1
this	1
bracelet;	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
given	1
it	1
to	1
anyone	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
deserve	1
it."	1
"Certainly	1
not,"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Villars.	1
"You	1
well	1
deserve	1
it	1
for	1
your	1
application--for	1
your	1
successful	1
application.	1
The	1
prize	1
was	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
assiduous,	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
amiable."	1
"Then,	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
amiable,	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
for	1
me?"	1
Mrs.	1
Villars,	1
smiling,--"Why,	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
yourself,	1
Cecilia?	1
You	1
are	1
better	1
able	1
to	1
judge	1
than	1
I	1
am.	1
I	1
can	1
determine	1
whether	1
or	1
no	1
you	1
apply	1
to	1
what	1
I	1
give	1
you	1
to	1
learn;	1
whether	1
you	1
attend	1
to	1
what	1
I	1
desire	1
you	1
to	1
do,	1
and	1
avoid	1
what	1
I	1
desire	1
you	1
not	1
to	1
do.	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
like	1
you	1
as	1
a	1
pupil,	1
but	1
I	1
cannot	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
you	1
as	1
a	1
companion,	1
unless	1
I	1
were	1
your	1
companion.	1
Therefore	1
I	1
must	1
judge	1
of	1
what	1
I	1
should	1
do,	1
by	1
seeing	1
what	1
others	1
do	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
circumstances."	1
"Oh,	1
pray	1
don't,	1
madam!	1
for	1
then	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
love	1
me	1
either.	1
And	1
yet	1
I	1
think	1
you	1
would	1
love	1
me;	1
for	1
I	1
hope	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
as	1
ready	1
to	1
oblige,	1
and	1
as	1
good-natured	1
as--"	1
"Yes,	1
Cecilia,	1
I	1
don't	1
doubt	1
but	1
that	1
you	1
would	1
be	1
very	1
good	1
natured	1
to	1
me;	1
but	1
I'm	1
afraid	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
like	1
you	1
unless	1
you	1
were	1
good-	1
tempered,	1
too."	1
"But,	1
madam,	1
by	1
good-natured	1
I	1
mean	1
good-tempered--it's	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
thing."	1
"No,	1
indeed,	1
I	1
understand	1
by	1
them	1
two	1
very	1
different	1
things.	1
You	1
are	1
good-natured,	1
Cecilia;	1
for	1
you	1
are	1
desirous	1
to	1
oblige	1
and	1
serve	1
your	1
companions--to	1
gain	1
them	1
praise,	1
and	1
save	1
them	1
from	1
blame--to	1
give	1
them	1
pleasure,	1
and	1
relieve	1
them	1
from	1
pain;	1
but	1
Leonora	1
is	1
good-tempered,	1
for	1
she	1
can	1
bear	1
with	1
their	1
foibles,	1
and	1
acknowledge	1
her	1
own.	1
Without	1
disputing	1
about	1
the	1
right,	1
she	1
sometimes	1
yields	1
to	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
wrong.	1
In	1
short,	1
her	1
temper	1
is	1
perfectly	1
good;	1
for	1
it	1
can	1
bear	1
and	1
forbear."	1
"I	1
wish	1
that	1
mine	1
could!"	1
said	1
Cecilia,	1
sighing.	1
"It	1
may,"	1
replied	1
Mrs.	1
Villars;	1
"but	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
wishes	1
alone	1
which	1
can	1
improve	1
us	1
in	1
anything.	1
Turn	1
the	1
same	1
exertion	1
and	1
perseverance	1
which	1
have	1
won	1
you	1
the	1
prize	1
to-day	1
to	1
this	1
object,	1
and	1
you	1
will	1
meet	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
success;	1
perhaps	1
not	1
on	1
the	1
first,	1
the	1
second,	1
or	1
the	1
third	1
attempt;	1
but	1
depend	1
upon	1
it	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
at	1
last.	1
Every	1
new	1
effort	1
will	1
weaken	1
your	1
bad	1
habits,	1
and	1
strengthen	1
your	1
good	1
ones.	1
But	1
you	1
must	1
not	1
expect	1
to	1
succeed	1
all	1
at	1
once.	1
I	1
repeat	1
it	1
to	1
you,	1
for	1
habit	1
must	1
be	1
counteracted	1
by	1
habit.	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
as	1
extravagant	1
in	1
us	1
to	1
expect	1
that	1
all	1
our	1
faults	1
could	1
be	1
destroyed	1
by	1
one	1
punishment,	1
were	1
it	1
ever	1
so	1
severe,	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
Roman	1
emperor	1
we	1
were	1
reading	1
of	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
ago,	1
to	1
wish	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
his	1
enemies	1
were	1
upon	1
one	1
neck,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
cut	1
them	1
off	1
at	1
one	1
blow."	1
Here	1
Mrs.	1
Villars	1
took	1
Cecilia	1
by	1
the	1
hand,	1
and	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
walk	1
home.	1
Such	1
was	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
Cecilia's	1
mind,	1
that	1
when	1
any	1
object	1
was	1
forcibly	1
impressed	1
on	1
her	1
imagination,	1
it	1
caused	1
a	1
temporary	1
suspension	1
of	1
her	1
reasoning	1
faculties.	1
Hope	1
was	1
too	1
strong	1
a	1
stimulus	1
for	1
her	1
spirits;	1
and	1
when	1
fear	1
did	1
take	1
possession	1
of	1
her	1
mind,	1
it	1
was	1
attended	1
with	1
total	1
debility.	1
Her	1
vanity	1
was	1
now	1
as	1
much	1
mortified	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
elated.	1
She	1
walked	1
on	1
with	1
Mrs.	1
Villars	1
in	1
silence,	1
until	1
they	1
came	1
under	1
the	1
shade	1
of	1
the	1
elm-tree	1
walk,	1
and	1
there,	1
fixing	1
her	1
eyes	1
upon	1
Mrs.	1
Villars,	1
she	1
stopped	1
short.	1
"Do	1
you	1
think,	1
madam,"	1
said	1
she,	1
with	1
hesitation--"do	1
you	1
think,	1
madam,	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
bad	1
heart?"	1
"A	1
bad	1
heart,--my	1
dear!	1
why,	1
what	1
put	1
that	1
into	1
your	1
head?"	1
"Leonora	1
said	1
that	1
I	1
had,	1
madam,	1
and	1
I	1
felt	1
ashamed	1
when	1
she	1
said	1
so."	1
"But,	1
my	1
dear,	1
how	1
can	1
Leonora	1
tell	1
whether	1
your	1
heart	1
be	1
good	1
or	1
bad?	1
However,	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
place,	1
tell	1
me	1
what	1
you	1
mean	1
by	1
a	1
bad	1
heart."	1
"Indeed	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
is	1
meant	1
by	1
it,	1
madam;	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
something	1
which	1
everybody	1
hates."	1
"And	1
why	1
do	1
they	1
hate	1
it?"	1
"Because	1
they	1
think	1
that	1
it	1
will	1
hurt	1
them,	1
ma'am,	1
I	1
believe:	1
and	1
that	1
those	1
who	1
have	1
bad	1
hearts	1
take	1
delight	1
in	1
doing	1
mischief;	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
never	1
do	1
anybody	1
any	1
good	1
but	1
for	1
their	1
own	1
ends."	1
"Then	1
the	1
best	1
definition,"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Villars,	1
"which	1
you	1
can	1
give	1
me	1
of	1
a	1
bad	1
heart	1
is,	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
some	1
constant	1
propensity	1
to	1
hurt	1
others,	1
and	1
to	1
do	1
wrong	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
doing	1
wrong."	1
"Yes,	1
madam;	1
but	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
all	1
either.	1
There	1
is	1
still	1
something	1
else	1
meant;	1
something	1
which	1
I	1
cannot	1
express--which,	1
indeed,	1
I	1
never	1
distinctly	1
understood;	1
but	1
of	1
which,	1
therefore,	1
I	1
was	1
the	1
more	1
afraid."	1
"Well,	1
then,	1
to	1
begin	1
with	1
what	1
you	1
do	1
understand,	1
tell	1
me,	1
Cecilia,	1
do	1
you	1
really	1
think	1
it	1
possible	1
to	1
be	1
wicked	1
merely	1
for	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
wickedness?	1
No	1
human	1
being	1
becomes	1
wicked	1
all	1
at	1
once.	1
A	1
man	1
begins	1
by	1
doing	1
wrong	1
because	1
it	1
is,	1
or	1
because	1
he	1
thinks	1
it,	1
for	1
his	1
interest.	1
If	1
he	1
continue	1
to	1
do	1
so,	1
he	1
must	1
conquer	1
his	1
sense	1
of	1
shame	1
and	1
lose	1
his	1
love	1
of	1
virtue.	1
But	1
how	1
can	1
you,	1
Cecilia,	1
who	1
feel	1
such	1
a	1
strong	1
sense	1
of	1
shame,	1
and	1
such	1
an	1
eager	1
desire	1
to	1
improve,	1
imagine	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
a	1
bad	1
heart?"	1
"Indeed,	1
madam,	1
I	1
never	1
did,	1
until	1
everybody	1
told	1
me	1
so,	1
and	1
then	1
I	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
frightened	1
about	1
it.	1
This	1
very	1
evening,	1
madam,	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
passion,	1
I	1
threw	1
little	1
Louisa's	1
strawberries	1
away,	1
which,	1
I	1
am	1
sure,	1
I	1
was	1
very	1
sorry	1
for	1
afterwards;	1
and	1
Leonora	1
and	1
everybody	1
cried	1
out	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
a	1
bad	1
heart--but	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
I	1
was	1
only	1
in	1
a	1
passion."	1
"Very	1
likely.	1
And	1
when	1
you	1
are	1
in	1
a	1
passion,	1
as	1
you	1
call	1
it,	1
Cecilia,	1
you	1
see	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
tempted	1
to	1
do	1
harm	1
to	1
others.	1
If	1
they	1
do	1
not	1
feel	1
angry	1
themselves,	1
they	1
do	1
not	1
sympathize	1
with	1
you.	1
They	1
do	1
not	1
perceive	1
the	1
motive	1
which	1
actuates	1
you;	1
and	1
then	1
they	1
say	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
a	1
bad	1
heart.	1
I	1
daresay,	1
however,	1
when	1
your	1
passion	1
is	1
over,	1
and	1
when	1
you	1
recollect	1
yourself,	1
you	1
are	1
very	1
sorry	1
for	1
what	1
you	1
have	1
done	1
and	1
said;	1
are	1
not	1
you?"	1
"Yes,	1
indeed,	1
madam--very	1
sorry."	1
"Then	1
make	1
that	1
sorry	1
of	1
use	1
to	1
you,	1
Cecilia,	1
and	1
fix	1
it	1
steadily	1
in	1
your	1
thoughts,	1
as	1
you	1
hope	1
to	1
be	1
good	1
and	1
happy,	1
that	1
if	1
you	1
suffer	1
yourself	1
to	1
yield	1
to	1
your	1
passion	1
upon	1
every	1
occasion,	1
anger	1
and	1
its	1
consequences	1
will	1
become	1
familiar	1
to	1
your	1
mind;	1
and,	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
proportion,	1
your	1
sense	1
of	1
shame	1
will	1
be	1
weakened,	1
till	1
what	1
you	1
began	1
with	1
doing	1
from	1
sudden	1
impulse	1
you	1
will	1
end	1
with	1
doing	1
from	1
habit	1
and	1
choice:	1
then	1
you	1
would,	1
indeed,	1
according	1
to	1
our	1
definition,	1
have	1
a	1
bad	1
heart."	1
"Oh,	1
madam!	1
I	1
hope--I	1
am	1
sure	1
I	1
never	1
shall."	1
"No,	1
indeed,	1
Cecilia;	1
I	1
do,	1
indeed,	1
believe	1
that	1
you	1
never	1
will;	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
disposition,	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
of	1
infinitely	1
more	1
consequence	1
to	1
you,	1
an	1
active	1
desire	1
of	1
improvement.	1
Show	1
me	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
as	1
much	1
perseverance	1
as	1
you	1
have	1
candour,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
despair	1
of	1
your	1
becoming	1
everything	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
wish."	1
Here	1
Cecilia's	1
countenance	1
brightened,	1
and	1
she	1
ran	1
up	1
the	1
steps	1
in	1
almost	1
as	1
high	1
spirits	1
as	1
she	1
ran	1
down	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
morning.	1
"Good-night	1
to	1
you,	1
Cecilia,"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Villars,	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
crossing	1
the	1
hall.	1
"Good-night	1
to	1
you,	1
madam,"	1
said	1
Cecilia;	1
and	1
she	1
ran	1
upstairs	1
to	1
bed.	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
go	1
to	1
sleep;	1
but	1
she	1
lay	1
awake,	1
reflecting	1
upon	1
the	1
events	1
of	1
the	1
preceding	1
day,	1
and	1
forming	1
resolutions	1
for	1
the	1
future,	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
resolved,	1
and	1
resolved	1
without	1
effect,	1
she	1
wished	1
to	1
give	1
her	1
mind	1
some	1
more	1
powerful	1
motive.	1
Ambition	1
she	1
knew	1
to	1
be	1
its	1
most	1
powerful	1
incentive.	1
"Have	1
I	1
not,"	1
said	1
she	1
to	1
herself,	1
"already	1
won	1
the	1
prize	1
of	1
application,	1
and	1
cannot	1
the	1
same	1
application	1
procure	1
me	1
a	1
much	1
higher	1
prize?	1
Mrs.	1
Villars	1
said	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
prize	1
had	1
been	1
promised	1
to	1
the	1
most	1
amiable,	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
given	1
to	1
me.	1
Perhaps	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
yesterday,	1
perhaps	1
it	1
might	1
not	1
to-morrow;	1
but	1
that	1
is	1
no	1
reason	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
despair	1
of	1
ever	1
deserving	1
it.".	1
In	1
consequence	1
of	1
this	1
reasoning,	1
Cecilia	1
formed	1
a	1
design	1
of	1
proposing	1
to	1
her	1
companions	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
give	1
a	1
prize,	1
the	1
first	1
of	1
the	1
ensuing	1
month	1
(the	1
lst	1
of	1
June),	1
to	1
the	1
most	1
amiable.	1
Mrs.	1
Villars	1
applauded	1
the	1
scheme,	1
and	1
her	1
companions	1
adopted	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
greatest	1
alacrity.	1
"Let	1
the	1
prize,"	1
said	1
they,	1
"be	1
a	1
bracelet	1
of	1
our	1
own	1
hair;"	1
and	1
instantly	1
their	1
shining	1
scissors	1
were	1
produced,	1
and	1
each	1
contributed	1
a	1
lock	1
of	1
their	1
hair.	1
They	1
formed	1
the	1
most	1
beautiful	1
gradation	1
of	1
colours,	1
from	1
the	1
palest	1
auburn	1
to	1
the	1
brightest	1
black.	1
Who	1
was	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
plaiting	1
them?	1
was	1
now	1
the	1
question.	1
Caroline	1
begged	1
that	1
she	1
might,	1
as	1
she	1
could	1
plait	1
very	1
neatly,	1
she	1
said.	1
Cecilia,	1
however,	1
was	1
equally	1
sure	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
do	1
it	1
much	1
better;	1
and	1
a	1
dispute	1
would	1
have	1
inevitably	1
ensued,	1
if	1
Cecilia,	1
recollecting	1
herself	1
just	1
as	1
her	1
colour	1
rose	1
to	1
scarlet,	1
had	1
not	1
yielded--yielded,	1
with	1
no	1
very	1
good	1
grace	1
indeed,	1
but	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
could	1
be	1
expected	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time.	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
habit	1
which	1
confers	1
ease;	1
and	1
without	1
ease,	1
even	1
in	1
moral	1
actions,	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
grace.	1
The	1
bracelet	1
was	1
plaited	1
in	1
the	1
neatest	1
manner	1
by	1
Caroline,	1
finished	1
round	1
the	1
edge	1
with	1
silver	1
twist,	1
and	1
on	1
it	1
was	1
worked,	1
in	1
the	1
smallest	1
silver	1
letters,	1
this	1
motto,	1
"TO	1
THE	1
MOST	1
AMIABLE."	1
The	1
moment	1
it	1
was	1
completed,	1
everybody	1
begged	1
to	1
try	1
it	1
on.	1
It	1
fastened	1
with	1
little	1
silver	1
clasps,	1
and	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
made	1
large	1
enough	1
for	1
the	1
eldest	1
girls,	1
it	1
was	1
too	1
large	1
for	1
the	1
youngest.	1
Of	1
this	1
they	1
bitterly	1
complained,	1
and	1
unanimously	1
entreated	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
cut	1
to	1
fit	1
them.	1
"How	1
foolish!"	1
exclaimed	1
Cecilia;	1
"don't	1
you	1
perceive	1
that	1
if	1
any	1
of	1
you	1
win	1
it,	1
you	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
but	1
to	1
put	1
the	1
clips	1
a	1
little	1
further	1
from	1
the	1
edge,	1
but	1
if	1
we	1
get	1
it,	1
we	1
can't	1
make	1
it	1
larger?"	1
"Very	1
true,"	1
said	1
they;	1
"but	1
you	1
need	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
called	1
us	1
foolish,	1
Cecilia."	1
It	1
was	1
by	1
such	1
hasty	1
and	1
unguarded	1
expressions	1
as	1
these	1
that	1
Cecilia	1
offended.	1
A	1
slight	1
difference	1
in	1
the	1
manner	1
makes	1
a	1
very	1
material	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
effect.	1
Cecilia	1
lost	1
more	1
love	1
by	1
general	1
petulance	1
than	1
she	1
could	1
gain	1
by	1
the	1
greatest	1
particular	1
exertions.	1
How	1
far	1
she	1
succeeded	1
in	1
curing	1
herself	1
of	1
this	1
defect--how	1
far	1
she	1
became	1
deserving	1
of	1
the	1
bracelet,	1
and	1
to	1
whom	1
the	1
bracelet	1
was	1
given--	1
shall	1
be	1
told	1
in	1
the	1
History	1
of	1
the	1
First	1
of	1
June.	1
-----	1
The	1
First	1
of	1
June	1
was	1
now	1
arrived,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
young	1
competitors	1
were	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
anxious	1
suspense.	1
Leonora	1
and	1
Cecilia	1
continued	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
foremost	1
candidates.	1
Their	1
quarrel	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
finally	1
adjusted,	1
and	1
their	1
different	1
pretensions	1
now	1
retarded	1
all	1
thoughts	1
of	1
a	1
reconciliation.	1
Cecilia,	1
though	1
she	1
was	1
capable	1
of	1
acknowledging	1
any	1
of	1
her	1
faults	1
in	1
public	1
before	1
all	1
her	1
companions,	1
could	1
not	1
humble	1
herself	1
in	1
private	1
to	1
Leonora.	1
Leonora	1
was	1
her	1
equal;	1
they	1
were	1
her	1
inferiors,	1
and	1
submission	1
is	1
much	1
easier	1
to	1
a	1
vain	1
mind,	1
where	1
it	1
appears	1
to	1
be	1
voluntary,	1
than	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
necessary	1
tribute	1
to	1
justice	1
or	1
candour.	1
So	1
strongly	1
did	1
Cecilia	1
feel	1
this	1
truth,	1
that	1
she	1
even	1
delayed	1
making	1
any	1
apology,	1
or	1
coming	1
to	1
any	1
explanation	1
with	1
Leonora,	1
until	1
success	1
should	1
once	1
more	1
give	1
her	1
the	1
palm.	1
"If	1
I	1
win	1
the	1
bracelet,	1
to-day,"	1
said	1
she	1
to	1
herself,	1
"I	1
will	1
solicit	1
the	1
return	1
of	1
Leonora's	1
friendship;	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
more	1
valuable	1
to	1
me	1
than	1
even	1
the	1
bracelet,	1
and	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
time,	1
and	1
asked	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
manner,	1
she	1
surely	1
cannot	1
refuse	1
it	1
to	1
me."	1
Animated	1
with	1
this	1
hope	1
of	1
a	1
double	1
triumph,	1
Cecilia	1
canvassed	1
with	1
the	1
most	1
zealous	1
activity.	1
By	1
constant	1
attention	1
and	1
exertion	1
she	1
had	1
considerably	1
abated	1
the	1
violence	1
of	1
her	1
temper,	1
and	1
changed	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
her	1
habits.	1
Her	1
powers	1
of	1
pleasing	1
were	1
now	1
excited,	1
instead	1
of	1
her	1
abilities	1
to	1
excel;	1
and,	1
if	1
her	1
talents	1
appeared	1
less	1
brilliant,	1
her	1
character	1
was	1
acknowledged	1
to	1
be	1
more	1
amiable.	1
So	1
great	1
an	1
influence	1
upon	1
our	1
manners	1
and	1
conduct	1
have	1
the	1
objects	1
of	1
our	1
ambition.	1
Cecilia	1
was	1
now,	1
if	1
possible,	1
more	1
than	1
ever	1
desirous	1
of	1
doing	1
what	1
was	1
right,	1
but	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
acquired	1
sufficient	1
fear	1
of	1
doing	1
wrong.	1
This	1
was	1
the	1
fundamental	1
error	1
of	1
her	1
mind;	1
it	1
arose	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
measure	1
from	1
her	1
early	1
education.	1
Her	1
mother	1
died	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
very	1
young;	1
and	1
though	1
her	1
father	1
had	1
supplied	1
her	1
place	1
in	1
the	1
best	1
and	1
kindest	1
manner,	1
he	1
had	1
insensibly	1
infused	1
into	1
his	1
daughter's	1
mind	1
a	1
portion	1
of	1
that	1
enterprising,	1
independent	1
spirit	1
which	1
he	1
justly	1
deemed	1
essential	1
to	1
the	1
character	1
of	1
her	1
brother.	1
This	1
brother	1
was	1
some	1
years	1
older	1
than	1
Cecilia,	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
always	1
been	1
the	1
favourite	1
companion	1
of	1
her	1
youth.	1
What	1
her	1
father's	1
precepts	1
inculcated,	1
his	1
example	1
enforced;	1
and	1
even	1
Cecilia's	1
virtues	1
consequently	1
became	1
such	1
as	1
were	1
more	1
estimable	1
in	1
a	1
man	1
than	1
desirable	1
in	1
a	1
female.	1
All	1
small	1
objects	1
and	1
small	1
errors	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
taught	1
to	1
disregard	1
as	1
trifles;	1
and	1
her	1
impatient	1
disposition	1
was	1
perpetually	1
leading	1
her	1
into	1
more	1
material	1
faults;	1
yet	1
her	1
candour	1
in	1
confessing	1
these,	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
suffered	1
to	1
believe,	1
was	1
sufficient	1
reparation	1
and	1
atonement.	1
Leonora,	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
educated	1
by	1
her	1
mother	1
in	1
a	1
manner	1
more	1
suited	1
to	1
her	1
sex,	1
had	1
a	1
character	1
and	1
virtues	1
more	1
peculiar	1
to	1
a	1
female.	1
Her	1
judgment	1
had	1
been	1
early	1
cultivated,	1
and	1
her	1
good	1
sense	1
employed	1
in	1
the	1
regulation	1
of	1
her	1
conduct.	1
She	1
had	1
been	1
habituated	1
to	1
that	1
restraint,	1
which,	1
as	1
a	1
woman,	1
she	1
was	1
to	1
expect	1
in	1
life,	1
and	1
early	1
accustomed	1
to	1
yield.	1
Compliance	1
in	1
her	1
seemed	1
natural	1
and	1
graceful;	1
yet	1
notwithstanding	1
the	1
gentleness	1
of	1
her	1
temper,	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
reality	1
more	1
independent	1
than	1
Cecilia.	1
She	1
had	1
more	1
reliance	1
upon	1
her	1
own	1
judgment,	1
and	1
more	1
satisfaction	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
approbation.	1
The	1
uniform	1
kindness	1
of	1
her	1
manner,	1
the	1
consistency	1
and	1
equality	1
of	1
her	1
character,	1
had	1
fixed	1
the	1
esteem	1
and	1
passive	1
love	1
of	1
her	1
companions.	1
By	1
passive	1
love	1
we	1
mean	1
that	1
species	1
of	1
affection	1
which	1
makes	1
us	1
unwilling	1
to	1
offend	1
rather	1
than	1
anxious	1
to	1
oblige,	1
which	1
is	1
more	1
a	1
habit	1
than	1
an	1
emotion	1
of	1
the	1
mind.	1
For	1
Cecilia	1
her	1
companions	1
felt	1
active	1
love,	1
for	1
she	1
was	1
active	1
in	1
showing	1
her	1
love	1
to	1
them.	1
Active	1
love	1
arises	1
spontaneously	1
in	1
the	1
mind,	1
after	1
feeling	1
particular	1
instances	1
of	1
kindness,	1
without	1
reflection	1
on	1
the	1
past	1
conduct	1
or	1
general	1
character.	1
It	1
exceeds	1
the	1
merits	1
of	1
its	1
object,	1
and	1
is	1
connected	1
with	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
generosity,	1
rather	1
than	1
with	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
justice.	1
Without	1
determining	1
which	1
species	1
of	1
love	1
is	1
the	1
most	1
flattering	1
to	1
others,	1
we	1
can	1
easily	1
decide	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
most	1
agreeable	1
feeling	1
to	1
our	1
minds.	1
We	1
give	1
our	1
hearts	1
more	1
credit	1
for	1
being	1
generous	1
than	1
for	1
being	1
just;	1
and	1
we	1
feel	1
more	1
self-complacency	1
when	1
we	1
give	1
our	1
love	1
voluntarily,	1
than	1
when	1
we	1
yield	1
it	1
as	1
a	1
tribute	1
which	1
we	1
cannot	1
withhold.	1
Though	1
Cecilia's	1
companions	1
might	1
not	1
know	1
all	1
this	1
in	1
theory,	1
they	1
proved	1
it	1
in	1
practice;	1
for	1
they	1
loved	1
her	1
in	1
a	1
much	1
higher	1
proportion	1
to	1
her	1
merits	1
than	1
they	1
loved	1
Leonora.	1
Each	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
judges	1
were	1
to	1
signify	1
their	1
choice	1
by	1
putting	1
a	1
red	1
or	1
a	1
white	1
shell	1
into	1
a	1
vase	1
prepared	1
for	1
the	1
purpose.	1
Cecilia's	1
colour	1
was	1
red,	1
Leonora's	1
white.	1
In	1
the	1
morning	1
nothing	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
but	1
these	1
shells;	1
nothing	1
talked	1
of	1
but	1
the	1
long	1
expected	1
event	1
of	1
the	1
evening.	1
Cecilia,	1
following	1
Leonora's	1
example,	1
had	1
made	1
it	1
a	1
point	1
of	1
honour	1
not	1
to	1
inquire	1
of	1
any	1
individual	1
her	1
vote,	1
previously	1
to	1
their	1
final	1
determination.	1
They	1
were	1
both	1
sitting	1
together	1
in	1
Louisa's	1
room.	1
Louisa	1
was	1
recovering	1
from	1
the	1
measles.	1
Everyone	1
during	1
her	1
illness	1
had	1
been	1
desirous	1
of	1
attending	1
her;	1
but	1
Leonora	1
and	1
Cecilia	1
were	1
the	1
only	1
two	1
that	1
were	1
permitted	1
to	1
see	1
her,	1
as	1
they	1
alone	1
had	1
had	1
the	1
distemper.	1
They	1
were	1
both	1
assiduous	1
in	1
their	1
care	1
of	1
Louisa,	1
but	1
Leonora's	1
want	1
of	1
exertion	1
to	1
overcome	1
any	1
disagreeable	1
feelings	1
of	1
sensibility	1
often	1
deprived	1
her	1
of	1
presence	1
of	1
mind,	1
and	1
prevented	1
her	1
from	1
being	1
so	1
constantly	1
useful	1
as	1
Cecilia.	1
Cecilia,	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
often	1
made	1
too	1
much	1
noise	1
and	1
bustle	1
with	1
her	1
officious	1
assistance,	1
and	1
was	1
too	1
anxious	1
to	1
invent	1
amusements	1
and	1
procure	1
comforts	1
for	1
Louisa,	1
without	1
perceiving	1
that	1
illness	1
takes	1
away	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
enjoying	1
them.	1
As	1
she	1
was	1
sitting	1
at	1
the	1
window	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
exerting	1
herself	1
to	1
entertain	1
Louisa,	1
she	1
heard	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
an	1
old	1
peddler	1
who	1
often	1
used	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
house.	1
Downstairs	1
they	1
ran	1
immediately,	1
to	1
ask	1
Mrs.	1
Villars'	1
permission	1
to	1
bring	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
hall.	1
Mrs.	1
Villars	1
consented,	1
and	1
away	1
Cecilia	1
ran	1
to	1
proclaim	1
the	1
news	1
to	1
her	1
companions.	1
Then,	1
first	1
returning	1
into	1
the	1
hall,	1
she	1
found	1
the	1
peddler	1
just	1
unbuckling	1
his	1
box,	1
and	1
taking	1
it	1
off	1
his	1
shoulders.	1
"What	1
would	1
you	1
be	1
pleased	1
to	1
want,	1
miss?"	1
said	1
the	1
peddler;	1
"I've	1
all	1
kinds	1
of	1
tweezer-cases,	1
rings,	1
and	1
lockets	1
of	1
all	1
sorts,"	1
continued	1
he,	1
opening	1
all	1
the	1
glittering	1
drawers	1
successively.	1
"Oh!"	1
said	1
Cecilia,	1
shutting	1
the	1
drawer	1
of	1
lockets	1
which	1
tempted	1
her	1
most,	1
"these	1
are	1
not	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
I	1
want.	1
Have	1
you	1
any	1
china	1
figures?	1
any	1
mandarins?"	1
"Alack-a-day,	1
miss,	1
I	1
had	1
a	1
great	1
stock	1
of	1
that	1
same	1
chinaware;	1
but	1
now	1
I'm	1
quite	1
out	1
of	1
them	1
kind	1
of	1
things;	1
but	1
I	1
believe,"	1
said	1
he,	1
rummaging	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
deepest	1
drawers,	1
"I	1
believe	1
I	1
have	1
one	1
left,	1
and	1
here	1
it	1
is."	1
"Oh,	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
very	1
thing!	1
what's	1
its	1
price?"	1
"Only	1
three	1
shillings,	1
ma'am."	1
Cecilia	1
paid	1
the	1
money,	1
and	1
was	1
just	1
going	1
to	1
carry	1
off	1
the	1
mandarin,	1
when	1
the	1
peddler	1
took	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
great-	1
coat	1
pocket	1
a	1
neat	1
mahogany	1
case.	1
It	1
was	1
about	1
a	1
foot	1
long,	1
and	1
fastened	1
at	1
each	1
end	1
by	1
two	1
little	1
clasps.	1
It	1
had	1
besides,	1
a	1
small	1
lock	1
in	1
the	1
middle.	1
"What	1
is	1
that?"	1
said	1
Cecilia,	1
eagerly.	1
"It's	1
only	1
a	1
china	1
figure,	1
miss,	1
which	1
I	1
am	1
going	1
to	1
carry	1
to	1
an	1
elderly	1
lady,	1
who	1
lives	1
nigh	1
hand,	1
and	1
who	1
is	1
mighty	1
fond	1
of	1
such	1
things."	1
"Could	1
you	1
let	1
me	1
look	1
at	1
it?"	1
"And	1
welcome,	1
miss,"	1
said	1
he,	1
and	1
opened	1
the	1
case.	1
"Oh,	1
goodness!	1
how	1
beautiful!"	1
exclaimed	1
Cecilia.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
figure	1
of	1
Flora,	1
crowned	1
with	1
roses,	1
and	1
carrying	1
a	1
basket	1
of	1
flowers	1
in	1
her	1
hand.	1
Cecilia	1
contemplated	1
it	1
with	1
delight.	1
"How	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
give	1
this	1
to	1
Louisa!"	1
said	1
she	1
to	1
herself;	1
and,	1
at	1
last,	1
breaking	1
silence,	1
"Did	1
you	1
promise	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
lady?"	1
"Oh,	1
no,	1
miss,	1
I	1
didn't	1
promise	1
it--she	1
never	1
saw	1
it;	1
and	1
if	1
so	1
be	1
that	1
you'd	1
like	1
to	1
take	1
it,	1
I'd	1
make	1
no	1
more	1
words	1
about	1
it."	1
"And	1
how	1
much	1
does	1
it	1
cost?"	1
"Why,	1
miss,	1
as	1
to	1
that,	1
I'll	1
let	1
you	1
have	1
it	1
for	1
half-a-guinea."	1
Cecilia	1
immediately	1
produced	1
the	1
box	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
kept	1
her	1
treasure,	1
and,	1
emptying	1
it	1
upon	1
the	1
table,	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
count	1
the	1
shillings.	1
Alas!	1
there	1
were	1
but	1
six	1
shillings.	1
"How	1
provoking!"	1
said	1
she;	1
"then	1
I	1
can't	1
have	1
it.	1
Where's	1
the	1
mandarin?	1
Oh,	1
I	1
have	1
it,"	1
said	1
she,	1
taking	1
it	1
up,	1
and	1
looking	1
at	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
utmost	1
disgust.	1
"Is	1
this	1
the	1
same	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
before?"	1
"Yes,	1
miss,	1
the	1
very	1
same,"	1
replied	1
the	1
peddler,	1
who,	1
during	1
this	1
time,	1
had	1
been	1
examining	1
the	1
little	1
box	1
out	1
of	1
which	1
Cecilia	1
had	1
taken	1
her	1
money--it	1
was	1
of	1
silver.	1
"Why,	1
ma'am,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"since	1
you've	1
taken	1
such	1
a	1
fancy	1
to	1
the	1
piece,	1
if	1
you've	1
a	1
mind	1
to	1
make	1
up	1
the	1
remainder	1
of	1
the	1
money,	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
this	1
here	1
little	1
box,	1
if	1
you	1
care	1
to	1
part	1
with	1
it."	1
Now	1
this	1
box	1
was	1
a	1
keepsake	1
from	1
Leonora	1
to	1
Cecilia.	1
"No,"	1
said	1
Cecilia	1
hastily,	1
blushing	1
a	1
little,	1
and	1
stretching	1
out	1
her	1
hand	1
to	1
receive	1
it.	1
"Oh,	1
miss!"	1
said	1
he,	1
returning	1
it	1
carelessly,	1
"I	1
hope	1
there's	1
no	1
offence.	1
I	1
meant	1
but	1
to	1
serve	1
you,	1
that's	1
all.	1
Such	1
a	1
rare	1
piece	1
of	1
china-work	1
has	1
no	1
cause	1
to	1
go	1
a-begging,"	1
added	1
he.	1
Then,	1
putting	1
the	1
Flora	1
deliberately	1
into	1
the	1
case,	1
and	1
turning	1
the	1
key	1
with	1
a	1
jerk,	1
he	1
let	1
it	1
drop	1
into	1
his	1
pocket;	1
when,	1
lifting	1
up	1
his	1
box	1
by	1
the	1
leather	1
straps,	1
he	1
was	1
preparing	1
to	1
depart.	1
"Oh,	1
stay	1
one	1
minute!"	1
said	1
Cecilia,	1
in	1
whose	1
mind	1
there	1
had	1
passed	1
a	1
very	1
warm	1
conflict	1
during	1
the	1
peddler's	1
harangue.	1
"Louisa	1
would	1
so	1
like	1
this	1
Flora,"	1
said	1
she,	1
arguing	1
with	1
herself.	1
"Besides,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
so	1
generous	1
in	1
me	1
to	1
give	1
it	1
to	1
her	1
instead	1
of	1
that	1
ugly	1
mandarin;	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
doing	1
only	1
common	1
justice,	1
for	1
I	1
promised	1
it	1
to	1
her,	1
and	1
she	1
expects	1
it.	1
Though,	1
when	1
I	1
come	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
this	1
mandarin,	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
even	1
so	1
good	1
as	1
hers	1
was.	1
The	1
gilding	1
is	1
all	1
rubbed	1
off,	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
absolutely	1
must	1
buy	1
this	1
for	1
her.	1
Oh,	1
yes!	1
I	1
will,	1
and	1
she	1
will	1
be	1
so	1
delighted!	1
and	1
then	1
everybody	1
will	1
say	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
prettiest	1
thing	1
they	1
ever	1
saw,	1
and	1
the	1
broken	1
mandarin	1
will	1
be	1
forgotten	1
for	1
ever."	1
Here	1
Cecilia's	1
hand	1
moved,	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
just	1
going	1
to	1
decide:	1
"Oh,	1
but	1
stop,"	1
said	1
she	1
to	1
herself,	1
"consider--Leonora	1
gave	1
me	1
this	1
box,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
keepsake.	1
However,	1
we	1
have	1
now	1
quarrelled,	1
and	1
I	1
dare	1
say	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
mind	1
my	1
parting	1
with	1
it.	1
I'm	1
sure	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
care	1
if	1
she	1
was	1
to	1
give	1
away	1
my	1
keepsake,	1
the	1
smelling-bottle,	1
or	1
the	1
ring	1
which	1
I	1
gave	1
her.	1
Then	1
what	1
does	1
it	1
signify?	1
Besides,	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
my	1
own?	1
and	1
have	1
I	1
not	1
a	1
right	1
to	1
do	1
what	1
I	1
please	1
with	1
it?"	1
At	1
this	1
moment,	1
so	1
critical	1
for	1
Cecilia,	1
a	1
party	1
of	1
her	1
companions	1
opened	1
the	1
door.	1
She	1
knew	1
that	1
they	1
came	1
as	1
purchasers,	1
and	1
she	1
dreaded	1
her	1
Flora's	1
becoming	1
the	1
prize	1
of	1
some	1
higher	1
bidder.	1
"Here,"	1
said	1
she,	1
hastily	1
putting	1
the	1
box	1
into	1
the	1
peddler's	1
hand,	1
without	1
looking	1
at	1
it;	1
"take	1
it,	1
and	1
give	1
me	1
the	1
Flora."	1
Her	1
hand	1
trembled,	1
though	1
she	1
snatched	1
it	1
impatiently.	1
She	1
ran	1
by,	1
without	1
seeming	1
to	1
mind	1
any	1
of	1
her	1
companions.	1
Let	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
tempted	1
to	1
do	1
wrong	1
by	1
the	1
hopes	1
of	1
future	1
gratification,	1
or	1
the	1
prospect	1
of	1
certain	1
concealment	1
and	1
impunity,	1
remember	1
that,	1
unless	1
they	1
are	1
totally	1
depraved,	1
they	1
bear	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
hearts	1
a	1
monitor,	1
who	1
will	1
prevent	1
their	1
enjoying	1
what	1
they	1
ill	1
obtained.	1
In	1
vain	1
Cecilia	1
ran	1
to	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
her	1
companions,	1
to	1
display	1
her	1
present,	1
in	1
hopes	1
that	1
the	1
applause	1
of	1
others	1
would	1
restore	1
her	1
own	1
self-	1
complacency;	1
in	1
vain	1
she	1
saw	1
the	1
Flora	1
pass	1
in	1
due	1
pomp	1
from	1
hand	1
to	1
hand,	1
each	1
vying	1
with	1
the	1
other	1
in	1
extolling	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
the	1
gift	1
and	1
the	1
generosity	1
of	1
the	1
giver.	1
Cecilia	1
was	1
still	1
displeased	1
with	1
herself,	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
even	1
with	1
their	1
praise.	1
From	1
Louisa's	1
gratitude,	1
however,	1
she	1
yet	1
expected	1
much	1
pleasure,	1
and	1
immediately	1
she	1
ran	1
upstairs	1
to	1
her	1
room.	1
In	1
the	1
meantime,	1
Leonora	1
had	1
gone	1
into	1
the	1
hall	1
to	1
buy	1
a	1
bodkin;	1
she	1
had	1
just	1
broken	1
hers.	1
In	1
giving	1
her	1
change,	1
the	1
peddler	1
took	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
pocket,	1
with	1
some	1
halfpence,	1
the	1
very	1
box	1
which	1
Cecilia	1
had	1
sold	1
to	1
him.	1
Leonora	1
did	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
suspect	1
the	1
truth,	1
for	1
her	1
mind	1
was	1
above	1
suspicion;	1
and	1
besides,	1
she	1
had	1
the	1
utmost	1
confidence	1
in	1
Cecilia.	1
"I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
have	1
that	1
box,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"for	1
it	1
is	1
like	1
one	1
of	1
which	1
I	1
was	1
very	1
fond."	1
The	1
peddler	1
named	1
the	1
price,	1
and	1
Leonora	1
took	1
the	1
box.	1
She	1
intended	1
to	1
give	1
it	1
to	1
little	1
Louisa.	1
On	1
going	1
to	1
her	1
room	1
she	1
found	1
her	1
asleep,	1
and	1
she	1
sat	1
softly	1
down	1
by	1
her	1
bedside.	1
Louisa	1
opened	1
her	1
eyes.	1
"I	1
hope	1
I	1
didn't	1
disturb	1
you,"	1
said	1
Leonora.	1
"Oh,	1
no.	1
I	1
didn't	1
hear	1
you	1
come	1
in;	1
but	1
what	1
have	1
you	1
got	1
there?"	1
"Only	1
a	1
little	1
box;	1
would	1
you	1
like	1
to	1
have	1
it?	1
I	1
bought	1
on	1
purpose	1
for	1
you,	1
as	1
I	1
thought	1
perhaps	1
it	1
would	1
please	1
you,	1
because	1
it's	1
like	1
that	1
which	1
I	1
gave	1
Cecilia."	1
"Oh,	1
yes!	1
that	1
out	1
of	1
which	1
she	1
used	1
to	1
give	1
me	1
Barbary	1
drops.	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
much	1
obliged	1
to	1
you;	1
I	1
always	1
thought	1
that	1
exceedingly	1
pretty,	1
and	1
this,	1
indeed,	1
is	1
as	1
like	1
it	1
as	1
possible.	1
I	1
can't	1
unscrew	1
it;	1
will	1
you	1
try?"	1
Leonora	1
unscrewed	1
it.	1
"Goodness!"	1
exclaimed	1
Louisa,	1
"this	1
must	1
be	1
Cecilia's	1
box.	1
Look,	1
don't	1
you	1
see	1
a	1
great	1
L	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
it?"	1
Leonora's	1
colour	1
changed.	1
"Yes,"	1
she	1
replied	1
calmly,	1
"I	1
see	1
that;	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
proof	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
Cecilia's.	1
You	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
bought	1
this	1
box	1
just	1
now	1
of	1
the	1
peddler."	1
"That	1
may	1
be,"	1
said	1
Louisa;	1
"but	1
I	1
remember	1
scratching	1
that	1
L	1
with	1
my	1
own	1
needle,	1
and	1
Cecilia	1
scolded	1
me	1
for	1
it,	1
too.	1
Do	1
go	1
and	1
ask	1
her	1
if	1
she	1
has	1
lost	1
her	1
box--do,"	1
repeated	1
Louisa,	1
pulling	1
her	1
by	1
the	1
ruffle,	1
as	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
listen.	1
Leonora,	1
indeed,	1
did	1
not	1
hear,	1
for	1
she	1
was	1
lost	1
in	1
thought.	1
She	1
was	1
comparing	1
circumstances,	1
which	1
had	1
before	1
escaped	1
her	1
attention.	1
She	1
recollected	1
that	1
Cecilia	1
had	1
passed	1
her	1
as	1
she	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
hall,	1
without	1
seeming	1
to	1
see	1
her,	1
but	1
had	1
blushed	1
as	1
she	1
passed.	1
She	1
remembered	1
that	1
the	1
peddler	1
appeared	1
unwilling	1
to	1
part	1
with	1
the	1
box,	1
and	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
put	1
it	1
again	1
in	1
his	1
pocket	1
with	1
the	1
halfpence.	1
"And	1
why	1
should	1
he	1
keep	1
it	1
in	1
his	1
pocket,	1
and	1
not	1
show	1
it	1
with	1
his	1
other	1
things?"	1
Combining	1
all	1
these	1
circumstances,	1
Leonora	1
had	1
no	1
longer	1
any	1
doubt	1
of	1
the	1
truth,	1
for	1
though	1
she	1
had	1
honourable	1
confidence	1
in	1
her	1
friends,	1
she	1
had	1
too	1
much	1
penetration	1
to	1
be	1
implicitly	1
credulous.	1
"Louisa,"	1
she	1
began,	1
but	1
at	1
this	1
instant	1
she	1
heard	1
a	1
step,	1
which,	1
by	1
its	1
quickness,	1
she	1
knew	1
to	1
be	1
Cecilia's,	1
coming	1
along	1
the	1
passage.	1
"If	1
you	1
love	1
me,	1
Louisa,"	1
said	1
Leonora,	1
"say	1
nothing	1
about	1
the	1
box."	1
"Nay,	1
but	1
why	1
not?	1
I	1
daresay	1
she	1
had	1
lost	1
it."	1
"No,	1
my	1
dear,	1
I'm	1
afraid	1
she	1
has	1
not."	1
Louisa	1
looked	1
surprised.	1
"But	1
I	1
have	1
reasons	1
for	1
desiring	1
you	1
not	1
to	1
say	1
anything	1
about	1
it."	1
"Well,	1
then,	1
I	1
won't,	1
indeed."	1
Cecilia	1
opened	1
the	1
door,	1
came	1
forward	1
smiling,	1
as	1
if	1
secure	1
of	1
a	1
good	1
reception,	1
and	1
taking	1
the	1
Flora	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
case,	1
she	1
placed	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
mantlepiece,	1
opposite	1
to	1
Louisa's	1
bed.	1
"Dear,	1
how	1
beautiful!"	1
cried	1
Louisa,	1
starting	1
up.	1
"Yes,"	1
said	1
Cecilia,	1
"and	1
guess	1
who	1
it's	1
for."	1
"For	1
me,	1
perhaps!"	1
said	1
the	1
ingenuous	1
Louisa.	1
"Yes,	1
take	1
it,	1
and	1
keep	1
it,	1
for	1
my	1
sake.	1
You	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
broke	1
your	1
mandarin."	1
"Oh,	1
but	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
prettier	1
and	1
larger	1
than	1
that."	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
know	1
it	1
is;	1
and	1
I	1
meant	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
so.	1
I	1
should	1
only	1
have	1
done	1
what	1
I	1
was	1
bound	1
to	1
do	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
only	1
given	1
you	1
a	1
mandarin."	1
"Well,"	1
replied	1
Louisa,	1
"and	1
that	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
enough,	1
surely;	1
but	1
what	1
a	1
beautiful	1
crown	1
of	1
roses!	1
and	1
then	1
that	1
basket	1
of	1
flowers!	1
they	1
almost	1
look	1
as	1
if	1
I	1
could	1
smell	1
them.	1
Dear	1
Cecilia,	1
I'm	1
very	1
much	1
obliged	1
to	1
you;	1
but	1
I	1
won't	1
take	1
it	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
payment	1
for	1
the	1
mandarin	1
you	1
broke;	1
for	1
I'm	1
sure	1
you	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
that,	1
and,	1
besides,	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
broken	1
it	1
myself	1
by	1
this	1
time.	1
You	1
shall	1
give	1
it	1
to	1
me	1
entirely;	1
and	1
as	1
your	1
keepsake,	1
I'll	1
keep	1
it	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
I	1
live."	1
Louisa	1
stopped	1
short	1
and	1
coloured;	1
the	1
word	1
keepsake	1
recalled	1
the	1
box	1
to	1
her	1
mind,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
train	1
of	1
ideas	1
which	1
the	1
Flora	1
had	1
banished.	1
"But,"	1
said	1
she,	1
looking	1
up	1
wistfully	1
in	1
Cecilia's	1
face,	1
and	1
holding	1
the	1
Flora	1
doubtfully,	1
"did	1
you--"	1
Leonora,	1
who	1
was	1
just	1
quitting	1
the	1
room,	1
turned	1
her	1
head	1
back,	1
and	1
gave	1
Louisa	1
a	1
look,	1
which	1
silenced	1
her.	1
Cecilia	1
was	1
so	1
infatuated	1
with	1
her	1
vanity,	1
that	1
she	1
neither	1
perceived	1
Leonora's	1
sign	1
nor	1
Louisa's	1
confusion,	1
but	1
continued	1
showing	1
off	1
her	1
present,	1
by	1
placing	1
it	1
in	1
various	1
situations,	1
till	1
at	1
length	1
she	1
put	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
case,	1
and	1
laying	1
it	1
down	1
with	1
an	1
affected	1
carelessness	1
upon	1
the	1
bed,	1
"I	1
must	1
go	1
now,	1
Louisa.	1
Good-bye,"	1
said	1
she,	1
running	1
up	1
and	1
kissing	1
her;	1
"but	1
I'll	1
come	1
again	1
presently,"	1
then,	1
clapping	1
the	1
door	1
after	1
her	1
she	1
went.	1
But	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
formentation	1
of	1
her	1
spirits	1
subsided,	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
shame,	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
scarcely	1
felt	1
when	1
mixed	1
with	1
so	1
many	1
other	1
sensations,	1
rose	1
uppermost	1
in	1
her	1
mind.	1
"What!"	1
said	1
she	1
to	1
herself,	1
"is	1
it	1
possible	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
sold	1
what	1
I	1
promised	1
to	1
keep	1
for	1
ever?	1
and	1
what	1
Leonora	1
gave	1
me?	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
concealed	1
it	1
too,	1
and	1
have	1
been	1
making	1
a	1
parade	1
of	1
my	1
generosity.	1
Oh!	1
what	1
would	1
Leonora,	1
what	1
would	1
Louisa--what	1
would	1
everybody	1
think	1
of	1
me,	1
if	1
the	1
truth	1
were	1
known?"	1
Humiliated	1
and	1
grieved	1
by	1
these	1
reflections,	1
Cecilia	1
began	1
to	1
search	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
mind	1
for	1
some	1
consoling	1
idea.	1
She	1
began	1
to	1
compare	1
her	1
conduct	1
with	1
that	1
of	1
others	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
age;	1
and	1
at	1
length,	1
fixing	1
her	1
comparison	1
upon	1
her	1
brother	1
George,	1
as	1
the	1
companion	1
of	1
whom,	1
from	1
her	1
infancy,	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
habitually	1
the	1
most	1
emulous,	1
she	1
recollected	1
that	1
an	1
almost	1
similar	1
circumstance	1
had	1
once	1
happened	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
only	1
escaped	1
disgrace,	1
but	1
had	1
acquired	1
glory,	1
by	1
an	1
intrepid	1
confession	1
of	1
his	1
fault.	1
Her	1
father's	1
word	1
to	1
her	1
brother,	1
on	1
the	1
occasion,	1
she	1
also	1
perfectly	1
recollected.	1
"Come	1
to	1
me,	1
George,"	1
he	1
said	1
holding	1
out	1
his	1
hand,	1
"you	1
are	1
a	1
generous,	1
brave	1
boy:	1
they	1
who	1
dare	1
to	1
confess	1
their	1
faults	1
will	1
make	1
great	1
and	1
good	1
men."	1
These	1
were	1
his	1
words;	1
but	1
Cecilia,	1
in	1
repeating	1
them	1
to	1
herself,	1
forgot	1
to	1
lay	1
that	1
emphasis	1
on	1
the	1
word	1
MEN,	1
which	1
would	1
have	1
placed	1
it	1
in	1
contradistinction	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
WOMEN.	1
She	1
willingly	1
believed	1
that	1
the	1
observation	1
extended	1
equally	1
to	1
both	1
sexes,	1
and	1
flattered	1
herself	1
that	1
she	1
should	1
exceed	1
her	1
brother	1
in	1
merit	1
if	1
she	1
owned	1
a	1
fault,	1
which	1
she	1
thought	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
so	1
much	1
more	1
difficult	1
to	1
confess.	1
"Yes,	1
but,"	1
said	1
she,	1
stopping	1
herself,	1
"how	1
can	1
I	1
confess	1
it?	1
This	1
very	1
evening,	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
hours,	1
the	1
prize	1
will	1
be	1
decided.	1
Leonora	1
or	1
I	1
shall	1
win	1
it.	1
I	1
have	1
now	1
as	1
good	1
a	1
chance	1
as	1
Leonora,	1
perhaps	1
a	1
better;	1
and	1
must	1
I	1
give	1
up	1
all	1
my	1
hopes--all	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
labouring	1
for	1
this	1
month	1
past?	1
Oh,	1
I	1
never	1
can!	1
If	1
it	1
were	1
but	1
to-morrow,	1
or	1
yesterday,	1
or	1
any	1
day	1
but	1
this,	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
hesitate;	1
but	1
now	1
I	1
am	1
almost	1
certain	1
of	1
the	1
prize,	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
win	1
it--well,	1
why	1
then	1
I	1
will--I	1
think	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
all--yes	1
I	1
will;	1
I	1
am	1
determined,"	1
said	1
Cecilia.	1
Here	1
a	1
bell	1
summoned	1
them	1
to	1
dinner.	1
Leonora	1
sat	1
opposite	1
to	1
her,	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
little	1
surprised	1
to	1
see	1
Cecilia	1
look	1
so	1
gay	1
and	1
unconstrained.	1
"Surely,"	1
said	1
she	1
to	1
herself,	1
"if	1
Cecilia	1
had	1
done	1
that	1
which	1
I	1
suspect,	1
she	1
would	1
not,	1
she	1
could	1
not,	1
look	1
as	1
she	1
does."	1
But	1
Leonora	1
little	1
knew	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
her	1
gaiety.	1
Cecilia	1
was	1
never	1
in	1
higher	1
spirits,	1
or	1
better	1
pleased	1
with	1
herself,	1
than	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
resolved	1
upon	1
a	1
sacrifice	1
or	1
a	1
confession.	1
"Must	1
not	1
this	1
evening	1
be	1
given	1
to	1
the	1
most	1
amiable?	1
Whose,	1
then,	1
will	1
it	1
be?"	1
All	1
eyes	1
glanced	1
first	1
at	1
Cecilia,	1
and	1
then	1
at	1
Leonora.	1
Cecilia	1
smiled;	1
Leonora	1
blushed.	1
"I	1
see	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
yet	1
decided,"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Villars;	1
and	1
immediately	1
they	1
ran	1
upstairs,	1
amidst	1
confused	1
whisperings.	1
Cecilia's	1
voice	1
could	1
be	1
distinguished	1
far	1
above	1
the	1
rest.	1
"How	1
can	1
she	1
be	1
so	1
happy!"	1
said	1
Leonora	1
to	1
herself.	1
"Oh	1
Cecilia,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
time	1
when	1
you	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
neglected	1
me	1
so!	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
always	1
together	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
friends	1
and	1
companions;	1
our	1
wishes,	1
tastes,	1
and	1
pleasures	1
the	1
same!	1
Surely	1
she	1
did	1
once	1
love	1
me,"	1
said	1
Leonora;	1
"but	1
now	1
she	1
is	1
quite	1
changed.	1
She	1
has	1
even	1
sold	1
my	1
keepsake;	1
and	1
she	1
would	1
rather	1
win	1
a	1
bracelet	1
of	1
hair	1
from	1
girls	1
whom	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
always	1
think	1
so	1
much	1
superior	1
to	1
Leonora,	1
than	1
have	1
my	1
esteem,	1
my	1
confidence,	1
and	1
my	1
friendship	1
for	1
her	1
whole	1
life--yes,	1
for	1
her	1
whole	1
life,	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
she	1
will	1
be	1
an	1
amiable	1
woman.	1
Oh,	1
that	1
this	1
bracelet	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
thought	1
of,	1
or	1
that	1
I	1
were	1
certain	1
of	1
her	1
winning	1
it;	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
that	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
win	1
it	1
from	1
her.	1
I	1
would	1
rather--a	1
thousand	1
times	1
rather--that	1
we	1
were	1
as	1
we	1
used	1
to	1
be	1
than	1
have	1
all	1
the	1
glory	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
And	1
how	1
pleasing	1
Cecilia	1
can	1
be	1
when	1
she	1
wishes	1
to	1
please!--how	1
candid	1
she	1
is!--	1
how	1
much	1
she	1
can	1
improve	1
herself!	1
Let	1
me	1
be	1
just,	1
though	1
she	1
has	1
offended	1
me;	1
she	1
is	1
wonderfully	1
improved	1
within	1
this	1
last	1
month.	1
For	1
one	1
fault,	1
and	1
THAT	1
against	1
myself,	1
shall	1
I	1
forget	1
all	1
her	1
merits?"	1
As	1
Leonora	1
said	1
these	1
last	1
words,	1
she	1
could	1
but	1
just	1
hear	1
the	1
voices	1
of	1
her	1
companions.	1
They	1
had	1
left	1
her	1
alone	1
in	1
the	1
gallery.	1
She	1
knocked	1
softly	1
at	1
Louisa's	1
door.	1
"Come	1
in,"	1
said	1
Louisa;	1
"I'm	1
not	1
asleep.	1
Oh,"	1
said	1
she,	1
starting	1
up	1
with	1
the	1
Flora	1
in	1
her	1
hand,	1
the	1
instant	1
that	1
the	1
door	1
was	1
opened;	1
"I'm	1
so	1
glad	1
you	1
are	1
come,	1
Leonora,	1
for	1
I	1
did	1
so	1
long	1
to	1
hear	1
what	1
you	1
all	1
were	1
making	1
such	1
a	1
noise	1
about.	1
Have	1
you	1
forgot	1
that	1
the	1
bracelet--"	1
"Oh,	1
yes!	1
is	1
this	1
the	1
evening?"	1
inquired	1
Leonora.	1
"Well,	1
here's	1
my	1
white	1
shell	1
for	1
you,"	1
said	1
Louisa.	1
"I've	1
kept	1
it	1
in	1
my	1
pocket	1
this	1
fortnight;	1
and	1
though	1
Cecilia	1
did	1
give	1
me	1
this	1
Flora,	1
I	1
still	1
love	1
you	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
better."	1
"I	1
thank	1
you,	1
Louisa,"	1
said	1
Leonora,	1
gratefully.	1
"I	1
will	1
take	1
your	1
shell,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
value	1
it	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
I	1
live;	1
but	1
here	1
is	1
a	1
red	1
one,	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
wish	1
to	1
show	1
me	1
that	1
you	1
love	1
me,	1
you	1
will	1
give	1
this	1
to	1
Cecilia.	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
she	1
is	1
particularly	1
anxious	1
for	1
your	1
preference,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
that	1
she	1
deserves	1
it."	1
"Yes,	1
if	1
I	1
could	1
I	1
would	1
choose	1
both	1
of	1
you,"	1
said	1
Louisa,	1
"but	1
you	1
know	1
I	1
can	1
only	1
choose	1
which	1
I	1
like	1
the	1
best."	1
"If	1
you	1
mean,	1
my	1
dear	1
Louisa,"	1
said	1
Leonora,	1
"that	1
you	1
like	1
me	1
the	1
best,	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
much	1
obliged	1
to	1
you,	1
for,	1
indeed,	1
I	1
wish	1
you	1
to	1
love	1
me;	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
enough	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
know	1
it	1
in	1
private.	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
feel	1
the	1
least	1
more	1
pleasure	1
at	1
hearing	1
it	1
in	1
public,	1
or	1
in	1
having	1
it	1
made	1
known	1
to	1
all	1
my	1
companions,	1
especially	1
at	1
a	1
time	1
when	1
it	1
would	1
give	1
poor	1
Cecilia	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
pain."	1
"But	1
why	1
should	1
it	1
give	1
her	1
pain?"	1
asked	1
Louisa;	1
"I	1
don't	1
like	1
her	1
for	1
being	1
jealous	1
of	1
you."	1
"Nay,	1
Louisa,	1
surely	1
you	1
don't	1
think	1
Cecilia	1
jealous?	1
She	1
only	1
tries	1
to	1
excel,	1
and	1
to	1
please;	1
she	1
is	1
more	1
anxious	1
to	1
succeed	1
than	1
I	1
am,	1
it	1
is	1
true,	1
because	1
she	1
has	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
more	1
activity,	1
and	1
perhaps	1
more	1
ambition.	1
And	1
it	1
would	1
really	1
mortify	1
her	1
to	1
lose	1
this	1
prize--you	1
know	1
that	1
she	1
proposed	1
it	1
herself.	1
It	1
has	1
been	1
her	1
object	1
for	1
this	1
month	1
past,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
she	1
has	1
taken	1
great	1
pains	1
to	1
obtain	1
it."	1
"But,	1
dear	1
Leonora,	1
why	1
should	1
you	1
lose	1
it?"	1
"Indeed,	1
my	1
dear,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
no	1
loss	1
to	1
me;	1
and,	1
if	1
it	1
were,	1
I	1
would	1
willingly	1
suffer	1
it	1
for	1
Cecilia;	1
for,	1
though	1
we	1
seem	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
such	1
good	1
friends	1
as	1
we	1
used	1
to	1
be,	1
I	1
love	1
her	1
very	1
much,	1
and	1
she	1
will	1
love	1
me	1
again--I'm	1
sure	1
she	1
will;	1
when	1
she	1
no	1
longer	1
fears	1
me	1
as	1
a	1
rival,	1
she	1
will	1
again	1
love	1
me	1
as	1
a	1
friend."	1
Here	1
Leonora	1
heard	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
her	1
companions	1
running	1
along	1
the	1
gallery.	1
They	1
all	1
knocked	1
hastily	1
at	1
the	1
door,	1
calling	1
"Leonora!	1
Leonora!	1
will	1
you	1
never	1
come?	1
Cecilia	1
has	1
been	1
with	1
us	1
this	1
half-hour."	1
Leonora	1
smiled.	1
"Well,	1
Louisa,"	1
said	1
she,	1
smiling,	1
"will	1
you	1
promise	1
me?"	1
"Oh,	1
I	1
am	1
sure,	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
they	1
speak	1
to	1
you,	1
that	1
they	1
won't	1
give	1
you	1
the	1
prize!"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
Louisa,	1
and	1
the	1
tears	1
started	1
into	1
her	1
eyes.	1
"They	1
love	1
me,	1
though,	1
for	1
all	1
that,"	1
said	1
Leonora;	1
"and	1
as	1
for	1
the	1
prize,	1
you	1
know	1
whom	1
I	1
wish	1
to	1
have	1
it."	1
"Leonora!	1
Leonora!"	1
called	1
her	1
impatient	1
companions;	1
"don't	1
you	1
hear	1
us?	1
What	1
are	1
you	1
about?"	1
"Oh,	1
she	1
never	1
will	1
take	1
any	1
trouble	1
about	1
anything,"	1
said	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
party;	1
"let's	1
go	1
away."	1
"Oh,	1
go,	1
go!	1
make	1
haste!"	1
cried	1
Louisa;	1
"don't	1
stay;	1
they	1
are	1
so	1
angry."	1
"Remember,	1
then,	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
promised	1
me,"	1
said	1
Leonora,	1
and	1
she	1
left	1
the	1
room.	1
During	1
all	1
this	1
time,	1
Cecilia	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
garden	1
with	1
her	1
companions.	1
The	1
ambition	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
felt	1
to	1
win	1
the	1
first	1
prize--the	1
prize	1
of	1
superior	1
talents	1
and	1
superior	1
application--was	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
compared	1
to	1
the	1
absolute	1
anxiety	1
which	1
she	1
now	1
expressed	1
to	1
win	1
this	1
simple	1
testimony	1
of	1
the	1
love	1
and	1
approbation	1
of	1
her	1
equals	1
and	1
rivals.	1
To	1
employ	1
her	1
exuberant	1
activity,	1
Cecilia	1
had	1
been	1
dragging	1
branches	1
of	1
lilacs	1
and	1
laburnums,	1
roses	1
and	1
sweet	1
briar,	1
to	1
ornament	1
the	1
bower	1
in	1
which	1
her	1
fate	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
decided.	1
It	1
was	1
excessively	1
hot,	1
but	1
her	1
mind	1
was	1
engaged,	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
indefatigable.	1
She	1
stood	1
still	1
at	1
last	1
to	1
admire	1
her	1
works.	1
Her	1
companions	1
all	1
joined	1
in	1
loud	1
applause.	1
They	1
were	1
not	1
a	1
little	1
prejudiced	1
in	1
her	1
favour	1
by	1
the	1
great	1
eagerness	1
which	1
she	1
expressed	1
to	1
win	1
their	1
prize,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
great	1
importance	1
which	1
she	1
seemed	1
to	1
affix	1
to	1
the	1
preference	1
of	1
each	1
individual.	1
At	1
last,	1
"Where	1
is	1
Leonora?"	1
cried	1
one	1
of	1
them;	1
and	1
immediately,	1
as	1
we	1
have	1
seen,	1
they	1
ran	1
to	1
call	1
her.	1
Cecilia	1
was	1
left	1
alone.	1
Overcome	1
with	1
heat	1
and	1
too	1
violent	1
exertion,	1
she	1
had	1
hardly	1
strength	1
to	1
support	1
herself;	1
each	1
moment	1
appeared	1
to	1
her	1
intolerably	1
long.	1
She	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
the	1
utmost	1
suspense,	1
and	1
all	1
her	1
courage	1
failed	1
her.	1
Even	1
hope	1
forsook	1
her;	1
and	1
hope	1
is	1
a	1
cordial	1
which	1
leaves	1
the	1
mind	1
depressed	1
and	1
enfeebled.	1
"The	1
time	1
is	1
now	1
come,"	1
said	1
Cecilia;	1
"in	1
a	1
few	1
moments	1
all	1
will	1
be	1
decided.	1
In	1
a	1
few	1
moments--goodness!	1
How	1
much	1
do	1
I	1
hazard?	1
If	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
win	1
the	1
prize,	1
how	1
shall	1
I	1
confess	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
done?	1
How	1
shall	1
I	1
beg	1
Leonora	1
to	1
forgive	1
me?	1
I,	1
who	1
hoped	1
to	1
restore	1
my	1
friendship	1
to	1
her	1
as	1
an	1
honour!	1
They	1
are	1
gone	1
to	1
seek	1
for	1
her.	1
The	1
moment	1
she	1
appears	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
forgotten.	1
What--what	1
shall	1
I	1
do?"	1
said	1
Cecilia,	1
covering	1
her	1
face	1
with	1
her	1
hands.	1
Such	1
was	1
Cecilia's	1
situation	1
when	1
Leonora,	1
accompanied	1
by	1
her	1
companions,	1
opened	1
the	1
hall	1
door.	1
They	1
most	1
of	1
them	1
ran	1
forwards	1
to	1
Cecilia.	1
As	1
Leonora	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
bower,	1
she	1
held	1
out	1
her	1
hand	1
to	1
Cecilia.	1
"We	1
are	1
not	1
rivals,	1
but	1
friends,	1
I	1
hope,"	1
said	1
she.	1
Cecilia	1
clasped	1
her	1
hand;	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
too	1
great	1
agitation	1
to	1
speak.	1
The	1
table	1
was	1
now	1
set	1
in	1
the	1
arbour--the	1
vase	1
was	1
now	1
placed	1
in	1
the	1
middle.	1
"Well!"	1
said	1
Cecilia,	1
eagerly,	1
"who	1
begins?"	1
Caroline,	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
friends,	1
came	1
forward	1
first,	1
and	1
then	1
all	1
the	1
others	1
successively.	1
Cecilia's	1
emotion	1
was	1
hardly	1
conceivable.	1
"Now	1
they	1
are	1
all	1
in!	1
Count	1
them,	1
Caroline!"	1
"One,	1
two,	1
three,	1
four;	1
the	1
numbers	1
are	1
both	1
equal."	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
dead	1
silence.	1
"No,	1
they	1
are	1
not,"	1
exclaimed	1
Cecilia,	1
pressing	1
forward,	1
and	1
putting	1
a	1
shell	1
into	1
a	1
vase.	1
"I	1
have	1
not	1
given	1
mine,	1
and	1
I	1
give	1
it	1
to	1
Leonora."	1
Then,	1
snatching	1
the	1
bracelet,	1
"It	1
is	1
yours,	1
Leonora,"	1
said	1
she;	1
"take	1
it,	1
and	1
give	1
me	1
back	1
your	1
friendship."	1
The	1
whole	1
assembly	1
gave	1
one	1
universal	1
clap	1
and	1
a	1
general	1
shout	1
of	1
applause.	1
"I	1
cannot	1
be	1
surprised	1
at	1
this	1
from	1
you,	1
Cecilia,"	1
said	1
Leonora;	1
"and	1
do	1
you	1
then	1
still	1
love	1
me	1
as	1
you	1
used	1
to	1
do?"	1
"Oh,	1
Leonora,	1
stop!	1
don't	1
praise	1
me;	1
I	1
don't	1
deserve	1
this,"	1
said	1
she,	1
turning	1
to	1
her	1
loudly	1
applauding	1
companions.	1
"You	1
will	1
soon	1
despise	1
me.	1
Oh,	1
Leonora,	1
you	1
will	1
never	1
forgive	1
me!	1
I	1
have	1
deceived	1
you;	1
I	1
have	1
sold--"	1
At	1
this	1
instant,	1
Mrs.	1
Villars	1
appeared.	1
The	1
crowd	1
divided.	1
She	1
had	1
heard	1
all	1
that	1
passed,	1
from	1
her	1
window.	1
"I	1
applaud	1
your	1
generosity,	1
Cecilia,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"but	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
that,	1
in	1
this	1
instance	1
it	1
is	1
unsuccessful.	1
You	1
have	1
not	1
it	1
in	1
your	1
power	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
prize	1
to	1
Leonora.	1
It	1
is	1
yours.	1
I	1
have	1
another	1
vote	1
to	1
give	1
to	1
you.	1
You	1
have	1
forgotten	1
Louisa."	1
"Louisa!"	1
exclaimed	1
Cecilia;	1
"but	1
surely,	1
ma'am,	1
Louisa	1
loves	1
Leonora	1
better	1
than	1
she	1
does	1
me."	1
"She	1
commissioned	1
me,	1
however,"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Villars,	1
"to	1
give	1
you	1
a	1
red	1
shell;	1
and	1
you	1
will	1
find	1
it	1
in	1
this	1
box."	1
Cecilia	1
started,	1
and	1
turned	1
as	1
pale	1
as	1
death;	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
fatal	1
box!	1
Mrs.	1
Villars	1
produced	1
another	1
box.	1
She	1
opened	1
it;	1
it	1
contained	1
the	1
Flora.	1
"And	1
Louisa	1
also	1
desired	1
me,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"to	1
return	1
to	1
you	1
this	1
Flora."	1
She	1
put	1
it	1
into	1
Cecilia's	1
hand.	1
Cecilia	1
trembled	1
so	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
hold	1
it.	1
Leonora	1
caught	1
it.	1
"Oh,	1
madam!	1
Oh,	1
Leonora!"	1
exclaimed	1
Cecilia;	1
"now	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
hope	1
left.	1
I	1
intended--I	1
was	1
just	1
going	1
to	1
tell--"	1
"Dear	1
Cecilia,"	1
said	1
Leonora,	1
"you	1
need	1
not	1
tell	1
it	1
me;	1
I	1
know	1
it	1
already;	1
and	1
I	1
forgive	1
you	1
with	1
all	1
my	1
heart."	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
can	1
prove	1
to	1
you,"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Villars,	1
"that	1
Leonora	1
has	1
forgiven	1
you.	1
It	1
is	1
she	1
who	1
has	1
given	1
you	1
the	1
prize;	1
it	1
was	1
she	1
who	1
persuaded	1
Louisa	1
to	1
give	1
you	1
her	1
vote.	1
I	1
went	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
a	1
little	1
while	1
ago;	1
and	1
perceiving,	1
by	1
her	1
countenance,	1
that	1
something	1
was	1
the	1
matter,	1
I	1
pressed	1
her	1
to	1
tell	1
me	1
what	1
it	1
was.	1
"'Why,	1
madam,'	1
said	1
she,	1
'Leonora	1
has	1
made	1
me	1
promise	1
to	1
give	1
my	1
shell	1
to	1
Cecilia.	1
Now	1
I	1
don't	1
love	1
Cecilia	1
half	1
so	1
well	1
as	1
I	1
do	1
Leonora.	1
Besides,	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
Cecilia	1
think	1
I	1
vote	1
for	1
her	1
because	1
she	1
gave	1
me	1
a	1
Flora.'	1
Whilst	1
Louisa	1
was	1
speaking,"	1
continued	1
Mrs.	1
Villars,	1
"I	1
saw	1
this	1
silver	1
box	1
lying	1
on	1
the	1
bed.	1
I	1
took	1
it	1
up,	1
and	1
asked	1
if	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
yours,	1
and	1
how	1
she	1
came	1
by	1
it.	1
'Indeed,	1
madam,'	1
said	1
Louisa,	1
'I	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
almost	1
certain	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
Cecilia's;	1
but	1
Leonora	1
gave	1
it	1
me,	1
and	1
she	1
said	1
that	1
she	1
bought	1
it	1
of	1
the	1
peddler	1
this	1
morning.	1
If	1
anybody	1
else	1
had	1
told	1
me	1
so,	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
believed	1
them,	1
because	1
I	1
remember	1
the	1
box	1
so	1
well;	1
but	1
I	1
can't	1
help	1
believing	1
Leonora.'	1
But	1
did	1
not	1
you	1
ask	1
Cecilia	1
about	1
it?	1
said	1
I.	1
'No,	1
madam,'	1
replied	1
Louisa;	1
'for	1
Leonora	1
forbade	1
me.	1
I	1
guessed	1
her	1
reason.'	1
Well,	1
said	1
I,	1
give	1
me	1
the	1
box,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
carry	1
your	1
shell	1
in	1
it	1
to	1
Cecilia.	1
'Then,	1
madam,'	1
said	1
she,	1
'if	1
I	1
must	1
give	1
it	1
her,	1
pray	1
do	1
take	1
the	1
Flora,	1
and	1
return	1
it	1
to	1
her	1
first,	1
that	1
she	1
may	1
not	1
think	1
it	1
is	1
for	1
that	1
I	1
do	1
it.'"	1
"Oh,	1
generous	1
Louisa!"	1
exclaimed	1
Cecilia;	1
"but,	1
indeed,	1
Leonora,	1
I	1
cannot	1
take	1
your	1
shell."	1
"Then,	1
dear	1
Cecilia,	1
accept	1
of	1
mine	1
instead	1
of	1
it!	1
you	1
cannot	1
refuse	1
it;	1
I	1
only	1
follow	1
your	1
example.	1
As	1
for	1
the	1
bracelet,"	1
added	1
Leonora,	1
taking	1
Cecilia's	1
hand,	1
"I	1
assure	1
you	1
I	1
don't	1
wish	1
for	1
it,	1
and	1
you	1
do,	1
and	1
you	1
deserve	1
it."	1
"No,"	1
said	1
Cecilia,	1
"indeed,	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
deserve	1
it.	1
Next	1
to	1
you,	1
surely	1
Louisa	1
deserves	1
it	1
best."	1
"Louisa!	1
oh,	1
yes,	1
Louisa,"	1
exclaimed	1
everybody	1
with	1
one	1
voice.	1
"Yes,"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Villars,	1
"and	1
let	1
Cecilia	1
carry	1
the	1
bracelet	1
to	1
her;	1
she	1
deserves	1
that	1
reward.	1
For	1
one	1
fault	1
I	1
cannot	1
forget	1
all	1
your	1
merits,	1
Cecilia,	1
nor,	1
I	1
am	1
sure,	1
will	1
your	1
companions."	1
"Then,	1
surely,	1
not	1
your	1
best	1
friend,"	1
said	1
Leonora,	1
kissing	1
her.	1
Everybody	1
present	1
was	1
moved.	1
They	1
looked	1
up	1
to	1
Leonora	1
with	1
respectful	1
and	1
affectionate	1
admiration.	1
"Oh,	1
Leonora,	1
how	1
I	1
love	1
you!	1
and	1
how	1
I	1
wish	1
to	1
be	1
like	1
you!"	1
exclaimed	1
Cecilia--"to	1
be	1
as	1
good,	1
as	1
generous!"	1
"Rather	1
wish,	1
Cecilia,"	1
interrupted	1
Mrs.	1
Villars,	1
"to	1
be	1
as	1
just;	1
to	1
be	1
as	1
strictly	1
honourable,	1
and	1
as	1
invariably	1
consistent.	1
Remember,	1
that	1
many	1
of	1
our	1
sex	1
are	1
capable	1
of	1
great	1
efforts--of	1
making	1
what	1
they	1
call	1
great	1
sacrifices	1
to	1
virtue	1
or	1
to	1
friendship;	1
but	1
few	1
treat	1
their	1
friends	1
with	1
habitual	1
gentleness,	1
or	1
uniformly	1
conduct	1
themselves	1
with	1
prudence	1
and	1
good	1
sense."	1

Those	1
who	1

us	1
an	1

of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
all	1
ages	1
in	1
the	1
celebrated	1
city	1
of	1
Naples.	1
Their	1
manner	1
of	1
living	1
and	1
their	1
numerous	1
employments	1
are	1
exactly	1
described	1
in	1
the	1
following	1
"Extract	1
from	1
a	1
Traveller's	1
Journal."	1

Varieties	1
of	1

p.	1
299.	1
"The	1
children	1
are	1
busied	1
in	1
various	1
ways.	1
A	1
great	1
number	1
of	1
them	1
bring	1
fish	1
for	1
sale	1
to	1
town	1
from	1
Santa	1
Lucia;	1
others	1
are	1
very	1
often	1
seen	1
about	1
the	1
arsenals,	1
or	1
wherever	1
carpenters	1
are	1
at	1
work,	1
employed	1
in	1
gathering	1
up	1
the	1
chips	1
and	1
pieces	1
of	1
wood;	1
or	1
by	1
the	1
sea-side,	1
picking	1
up	1
sticks,	1
and	1
whatever	1
else	1
has	1
drifted	1
ashore,	1
which,	1
when	1
their	1
basket	1
is	1
full,	1
they	1
carry	1
away.	1
"Children	1
of	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
years	1
old,	1
who	1
can	1
scarcely	1
crawl	1
along	1
upon	1
the	1
ground,	1
in	1
company	1
with	1
boys	1
of	1
five	1
or	1
six,	1
are	1
employed	1
in	1
this	1
pretty	1
trade.	1
Hence	1
they	1
proceed	1
with	1
their	1
baskets	1
into	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
where	1
in	1
several	1
places	1
they	1
form	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
little	1
market,	1
sitting	1
round	1
with	1
their	1
stock	1
of	1
wood	1
before	1
them.	1
Labourers,	1
and	1
the	1
lower	1
order	1
of	1
citizens,	1
buy	1
it	1
of	1
them	1
to	1
burn	1
in	1
the	1
tripods	1
for	1
warming	1
themselves,	1
or	1
to	1
use	1
in	1
their	1
scanty	1
kitchens.	1
"Other	1
children	1
carry	1
about	1
for	1
sale	1
the	1
water	1
of	1
the	1
sulphurous	1
wells,	1
which,	1
particularly	1
in	1
the	1
spring	1
season,	1
is	1
drunk	1
in	1
great	1
abundance.	1
Others	1
again	1
endeavour	1
to	1
turn	1
a	1
few	1
pence	1
by	1
buying	1
a	1
small	1
matter	1
of	1
fruit,	1
of	1
pressed	1
honey,	1
cakes,	1
and	1
comfits,	1
and	1
then,	1
like	1
little	1
peddlers,	1
offer	1
and	1
sell	1
them	1
to	1
other	1
children,	1
always	1
for	1
no	1
more	1
profit	1
than	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
have	1
their	1
share	1
of	1
them	1
free	1
of	1
expense.	1
"It	1
is	1
really	1
curious	1
to	1
see	1
how	1
an	1
urchin,	1
whose	1
whole	1
stock	1
and	1
property	1
consist	1
in	1
a	1
board	1
and	1
a	1
knife,	1
will	1
carry	1
about	1
a	1
water-melon,	1
or	1
a	1
half	1
roasted	1
gourd,	1
collect	1
a	1
troup	1
of	1
children	1
round	1
him,	1
set	1
down	1
his	1
board,	1
and	1
proceed	1
to	1
divide	1
the	1
fruit	1
into	1
small	1
pieces	1
among	1
them.	1
"The	1
buyers	1
keep	1
a	1
sharp	1
look	1
out	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
enough	1
for	1
their	1
little	1
piece	1
of	1
copper;	1
and	1
the	1
Lilliputian	1
tradesmen	1
act	1
with	1
no	1
less	1
caution	1
as	1
the	1
exigencies	1
of	1
the	1
case	1
may	1
require,	1
to	1
prevent	1
his	1
being	1
cheated	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
morsel."	1
The	1
advantages	1
of	1
truth	1
and	1
honesty,	1
and	1
the	1
value	1
of	1
a	1
character	1
for	1
integrity,	1
are	1
very	1
early	1
felt	1
amongst	1
these	1
little	1
merchants	1
in	1
their	1
daily	1
intercourse	1
with	1
each	1
other.	1
The	1
fair	1
dealer	1
is	1
always	1
sooner	1
or	1
later	1
seen	1
to	1
prosper.	1
The	1
most	1
cunning	1
cheat	1
is	1
at	1
last	1
detected	1
and	1
disgraced.	1
Numerous	1
instances	1
of	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
this	1
common	1
observation	1
were	1
remarked	1
by	1
many	1
Neapolitan	1
children,	1
especially	1
by	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
acquainted	1
with	1
the	1
characters	1
and	1
history	1
of	1
Piedro	1
and	1
Francisco,	1
two	1
boys	1
originally	1
equal	1
in	1
birth,	1
fortune	1
and	1
capacity,	1
but	1
different	1
in	1
their	1
education,	1
and	1
consequently	1
in	1
their	1
habits	1
and	1
conduct.	1
Francisco	1
was	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
an	1
honest	1
gardener,	1
who,	1
from	1
the	1
time	1
he	1
could	1
speak,	1
taught	1
him	1
to	1
love	1
to	1
speak	1
the	1
truth,	1
showed	1
him	1
that	1
liars	1
are	1
never	1
believed--that	1
cheats	1
and	1
thieves	1
cannot	1
be	1
trusted,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
shortest	1
way	1
to	1
obtain	1
a	1
good	1
character	1
is	1
to	1
deserve	1
it.	1

proverb	1
says,	1
take	1
all	1
impressions.	1
The	1
boy	1
profited	1
much	1
by	1
his	1
father's	1
precepts,	1
and	1
more	1
by	1
his	1
example;	1
he	1
always	1
heard	1
his	1
father	1
speak	1
the	1
truth,	1
and	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
dealt	1
fairly	1
with	1
everybody.	1
In	1
all	1
his	1
childish	1
traffic,	1
Francisco,	1
imitating	1
his	1
parents,	1
was	1
scrupulously	1
honest,	1
and	1
therefore	1
all	1
his	1
companions	1
trusted	1
him--"As	1
honest	1
as	1
Francisco,"	1
became	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
proverb	1
amongst	1
them.	1
"As	1
honest	1
as	1
Francisco,"	1
repeated	1
Piedro's	1
father,	1
when	1
he	1
one	1
day	1
heard	1
this	1
saying.	1
"Let	1
them	1
say	1
so;	1
I	1
say,	1
'As	1
sharp	1
as	1
Piedro';	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
see	1
which	1
will	1
go	1
through	1
the	1
world	1
best."	1
With	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
making	1
his	1
son	1
SHARP	1
he	1
made	1
him	1
cunning.	1
He	1
taught	1
him,	1
that	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
GOOD	1
BARGAIN	1
was	1
to	1
deceive	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
value	1
and	1
price	1
of	1
whatever	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
dispose	1
of;	1
to	1
get	1
as	1
much	1
money	1
as	1
possible	1
from	1
customers	1
by	1
taking	1
advantage	1
of	1
their	1
ignorance	1
or	1
of	1
their	1
confidence.	1
He	1
often	1
repeated	1
his	1
favourite	1
proverb--"The	1
buyer	1
has	1
need	1
of	1
a	1
hundred	1
eyes;	1
the	1
seller	1
has	1
need	1
but	1
of	1
one."	1
*	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
frequent	1
opportunities	1
of	1
explaining	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
this	1
maxim	1
to	1
his	1
son.	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
fisherman;	1
and	1
as	1
his	1
gains	1
depended	1
more	1
upon	1
fortune	1
than	1
upon	1
prudence,	1
he	1
trusted	1
habitually	1
to	1
his	1
good	1
luck.	1
After	1
being	1
idle	1
for	1
a	1
whole	1
day,	1
he	1
would	1
cast	1
his	1
line	1
or	1
his	1
nets,	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
was	1
lucky	1
enough	1
to	1
catch	1
a	1
fine	1
fish,	1
he	1
would	1
go	1
and	1
show	1
it	1
in	1
triumph	1
to	1
his	1
neighbour	1
the	1
gardener.	1
*	1
Chi	1
compra	1
ha	1
bisogna	1
di	1
cent'	1
occhi;	1
chi	1
vende	1
n'ha	1
assai	1
di	1
uno.	1
"You	1
are	1
obliged	1
to	1
work	1
all	1
day	1
long	1
for	1
your	1
daily	1
bread,"	1
he	1
would	1
say.	1
"Look	1
here;	1
I	1
work	1
but	1
five	1
minutes,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
only	1
daily	1
bread,	1
but	1
daily	1
fish."	1
Upon	1
these	1
occasions,	1
our	1
fisherman	1
always	1
forgot,	1
or	1
neglected	1
to	1
count,	1
the	1
hours	1
and	1
days	1
which	1
were	1
wasted	1
in	1
waiting	1
for	1
a	1
fair	1
wind	1
to	1
put	1
to	1
sea,	1
or	1
angling	1
in	1
vain	1
on	1
the	1
shore.	1
Little	1
Piedro,	1
who	1
used	1
to	1
bask	1
in	1
the	1
sun	1
upon	1
the	1
sea-shore	1
beside	1
his	1
father,	1
and	1
to	1
lounge	1
or	1
sleep	1
away	1
his	1
time	1
in	1
a	1
fishing-boat,	1
acquired	1
habits	1
of	1
idleness,	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
his	1
father	1
of	1
little	1
consequence	1
whilst	1
he	1
was	1
BUT	1
A	1
CHILD.	1
"What	1
will	1
you	1
do	1
with	1
Piedro	1
as	1
he	1
grows	1
up,	1
neighbour?"	1
said	1
the	1
gardener.	1
"He	1
is	1
smart	1
and	1
quick	1
enough,	1
but	1
he	1
is	1
always	1
in	1
mischief.	1
Scarcely	1
a	1
day	1
has	1
passed	1
for	1
this	1
fortnight	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
caught	1
him	1
amongst	1
my	1
grapes.	1
I	1
track	1
his	1
footsteps	1
all	1
over	1
my	1
vineyard."	1
"HE	1
IS	1
BUT	1
A	1
CHILD	1
yet,	1
and	1
knows	1
no	1
better,"	1
replied	1
the	1
fisherman.	1
"But	1
if	1
you	1
don't	1
teach	1
him	1
better	1
now	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
child,	1
how	1
will	1
he	1
know	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
man?"	1
said	1
the	1
gardener.	1
"A	1
mighty	1
noise	1
about	1
a	1
bunch	1
of	1
grapes,	1
truly!"	1
cried	1
the	1
fisherman:	1
"a	1
few	1
grapes	1
more	1
or	1
less	1
in	1
your	1
vineyard,	1
what	1
does	1
it	1
signify?"	1
"I	1
speak	1
for	1
your	1
son's	1
sake,	1
and	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
my	1
grapes,"	1
said	1
the	1
gardener;	1
"and	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
again,	1
the	1
boy	1
will	1
not	1
do	1
well	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
neighbour,	1
if	1
you	1
don't	1
look	1
after	1
him	1
in	1
time."	1
"He'll	1
do	1
well	1
enough	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
you	1
will	1
find,"	1
answered	1
the	1
fisherman,	1
carelessly.	1
"Whenever	1
he	1
casts	1
my	1
nets,	1
they	1
never	1
come	1
up	1
empty.	1
'It	1
is	1
better	1
to	1
be	1
lucky	1
than	1
wise.'"	1
*	1
*	1
E	1
meglio	1
esser	1
fortunato	1
che	1
savio.	1
This	1
was	1
a	1
proverb	1
which	1
Piedro	1
had	1
frequently	1
heard	1
from	1
his	1
father,	1
and	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
most	1
willingly	1
trusted,	1
because	1
it	1
gave	1
him	1
less	1
trouble	1
to	1
fancy	1
himself	1
fortunate	1
than	1
to	1
make	1
himself	1
wise.	1
"Come	1
here,	1
child,"	1
said	1
his	1
father	1
to	1
him,	1
when	1
he	1
returned	1
home	1
after	1
the	1
preceding	1
conversation	1
with	1
the	1
gardener;	1
"how	1
old	1
are	1
you,	1
my	1
boy?--	1
twelve	1
years	1
old,	1
is	1
not	1
it?"	1
"As	1
old	1
as	1
Francisco,	1
and	1
older	1
by	1
six	1
months,"	1
said	1
Piedro.	1
"And	1
smarter	1
and	1
more	1
knowing	1
by	1
six	1
years,"	1
said	1
his	1
father.	1
"Here,	1
take	1
these	1
fish	1
to	1
Naples,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
see	1
how	1
you'll	1
sell	1
them	1
for	1
me.	1
Venture	1
a	1
small	1
fish,	1
as	1
the	1
proverb	1
says,	1
to	1
catch	1
a	1
great	1
one.	1
*	1
I	1
was	1
too	1
late	1
with	1
them	1
at	1
the	1
market	1
yesterday,	1
but	1
nobody	1
will	1
know	1
but	1
what	1
they	1
are	1
just	1
fresh	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
water,	1
unless	1
you	1
go	1
and	1
tell	1
them."	1
*	1
Butta	1
una	1
sardella	1
per	1
pigliar	1
un	1
luccio.	1
"Not	1
I;	1
trust	1
me	1
for	1
that;	1
I'm	1
not	1
such	1
a	1
fool,"	1
replied	1
Piedro,	1
laughing;	1
"I	1
leave	1
that	1
to	1
Francisco.	1
Do	1
you	1
know,	1
I	1
saw	1
him	1
the	1
other	1
day	1
miss	1
selling	1
a	1
melon	1
for	1
his	1
father	1
by	1
turning	1
the	1
bruised	1
side	1
to	1
the	1
customer,	1
who	1
was	1
just	1
laying	1
down	1
the	1
money	1
for	1
it,	1
and	1
who	1
was	1
a	1
raw	1
servant-boy,	1
moreover--one	1
who	1
would	1
never	1
have	1
guessed	1
there	1
were	1
two	1
sides	1
to	1
a	1
melon,	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
not,	1
as	1
you	1
say,	1
father,	1
been	1
told	1
of	1
it?"	1
"Off	1
with	1
you	1
to	1
market.	1
You	1
are	1
a	1
droll	1
chap,"	1
said	1
his	1
father,	1
"and	1
will	1
sell	1
my	1
fish	1
cleverly,	1
I'll	1
be	1
bound.	1
As	1
to	1
the	1
rest,	1
let	1
every	1
man	1
take	1
care	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
grapes.	1
You	1
understand	1
me,	1
Piedro?"	1
"Perfectly,"	1
said	1
the	1
boy,	1
who	1
perceived	1
that	1
his	1
father	1
was	1
indifferent	1
as	1
to	1
his	1
honesty,	1
provided	1
he	1
sold	1
fish	1
at	1
the	1
highest	1
price	1
possible.	1
He	1
proceeded	1
to	1
the	1
market,	1
and	1
he	1
offered	1
his	1
fish	1
with	1
assiduity	1
to	1
every	1
person	1
whom	1
he	1
thought	1
likely	1
to	1
buy	1
it,	1
especially	1
to	1
those	1
upon	1
whom	1
he	1
thought	1
he	1
could	1
impose.	1
He	1
positively	1
asserted	1
to	1
all	1
who	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
fish,	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
just	1
fresh	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
water.	1
Good	1
judges	1
of	1
men	1
and	1
fish	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
said	1
what	1
was	1
false,	1
and	1
passed	1
him	1
by	1
with	1
neglect;	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
at	1
last	1
what	1
he	1
called	1
GOOD	1
LUCK	1
to	1
meet	1
with	1
the	1
very	1
same	1
young	1
raw	1
servant-boy	1
who	1
would	1
have	1
bought	1
the	1
bruised	1
melon	1
from	1
Francisco.	1
He	1
made	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
directly,	1
crying,	1
"Fish!	1
Fine	1
fresh	1
fish!	1
fresh	1
fish!"	1
"Was	1
it	1
caught	1
to-day?"	1
said	1
the	1
boy.	1
"Yes,	1
this	1
morning;	1
not	1
an	1
hour	1
ago,"	1
said	1
Piedro,	1
with	1
the	1
greatest	1
effrontery.	1
The	1
servant-boy	1
was	1
imposed	1
upon;	1
and	1
being	1
a	1
foreigner,	1
speaking	1
the	1
Italian	1
language	1
but	1
imperfectly,	1
and	1
not	1
being	1
expert	1
at	1
reckoning	1
the	1
Italian	1
money,	1
he	1
was	1
no	1
match	1
for	1
the	1
cunning	1
Piedro,	1
who	1
cheated	1
him	1
not	1
only	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
freshness,	1
but	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
price	1
of	1
the	1
commodity.	1
Piedro	1
received	1
nearly	1
half	1
as	1
much	1
again	1
for	1
his	1
fish	1
as	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
done.	1
On	1
his	1
road	1
homewards	1
from	1
Naples	1
to	1
the	1
little	1
village	1
of	1
Resina,	1
where	1
his	1
father	1
lived,	1
he	1
overtook	1
Francisco,	1
who	1
was	1
leading	1
his	1
father's	1
ass.	1
The	1
ass	1
was	1
laden	1
with	1
large	1
panniers,	1
which	1
were	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
stalks	1
and	1
leaves	1
of	1
cauliflowers,	1
cabbages,	1
broccoli,	1
lettuces,	1
etc.--	1
all	1
the	1
refuse	1
of	1
the	1
Neapolitan	1
kitchens,	1
which	1
are	1
usually	1
collected	1
by	1
the	1
gardeners'	1
boys,	1
and	1
carried	1
to	1
the	1
gardens	1
round	1
Naples,	1
to	1
be	1
mixed	1
with	1
other	1
manure.	1
"Well	1
filled	1
panniers,	1
truly,"	1
said	1
Piedro,	1
as	1
he	1
overtook	1
Francisco	1
and	1
the	1
ass.	1
The	1
panniers	1
were	1
indeed	1
not	1
only	1
filled	1
to	1
the	1
top,	1
but	1
piled	1
up	1
with	1
much	1
skill	1
and	1
care,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
load	1
met	1
over	1
the	1
animal's	1
back.	1
"It	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
very	1
heavy	1
load	1
for	1
the	1
ass,	1
though	1
it	1
looks	1
so	1
large,"	1
said	1
Francisco.	1
"The	1
poor	1
fellow,	1
however,	1
shall	1
have	1
a	1
little	1
of	1
this	1
water,"	1
added	1
he,	1
leading	1
the	1
ass	1
to	1
a	1
pool	1
by	1
the	1
roadside.	1
"I	1
was	1
not	1
thinking	1
of	1
the	1
ass,	1
boy;	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
thinking	1
of	1
any	1
ass,	1
but	1
of	1
you,	1
when	1
I	1
said,	1
'Well	1
filled	1
panniers,	1
truly!'	1
This	1
is	1
your	1
morning's	1
work,	1
I	1
presume,	1
and	1
you'll	1
make	1
another	1
journey	1
to	1
Naples	1
to-	1
day,	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
errand,	1
I	1
warrant,	1
before	1
your	1
father	1
thinks	1
you	1
have	1
done	1
enough?"	1
"Not	1
before	1
MY	1
FATHER	1
thinks	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
enough,	1
but	1
before	1
I	1
think	1
so	1
myself,"	1
replied	1
Francisco.	1
"I	1
do	1
enough	1
to	1
satisfy	1
myself	1
and	1
my	1
father,	1
too,"	1
said	1
Piedro,	1
"without	1
slaving	1
myself	1
after	1
your	1
fashion.	1
Look	1
here,"	1
producing	1
the	1
money	1
he	1
had	1
received	1
for	1
the	1
fish;	1
"all	1
this	1
was	1
had	1
for	1
asking.	1
It	1
is	1
no	1
bad	1
thing,	1
you'll	1
allow,	1
to	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
ask	1
for	1
money	1
properly."	1
"I	1
should	1
be	1
ashamed	1
to	1
beg,	1
or	1
borrow	1
either,"	1
said	1
Francisco.	1
"Neither	1
did	1
I	1
get	1
what	1
you	1
see	1
by	1
begging,	1
or	1
borrowing	1
either,"	1
said	1
Piedro,	1
"but	1
by	1
using	1
my	1
wits;	1
not	1
as	1
you	1
did	1
yesterday,	1
when,	1
like	1
a	1
novice,	1
you	1
showed	1
the	1
bruised	1
side	1
of	1
your	1
melon,	1
and	1
so	1
spoiled	1
your	1
market	1
by	1
your	1
wisdom."	1
"Wisdom	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
still,"	1
said	1
Francisco.	1
"And	1
your	1
father?"	1
asked	1
Piedro.	1
"And	1
my	1
father,"	1
said	1
Francisco.	1
"Mine	1
is	1
of	1
a	1
different	1
way	1
of	1
thinking,"	1
said	1
Piedro.	1
"He	1
always	1
tells	1
me	1
that	1
the	1
buyer	1
has	1
need	1
of	1
a	1
hundred	1
eyes,	1
and	1
if	1
one	1
can	1
blind	1
the	1
whole	1
hundred,	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
better.	1
You	1
must	1
know,	1
I	1
got	1
off	1
the	1
fish	1
to-	1
day	1
that	1
my	1
father	1
could	1
not	1
sell	1
yesterday	1
in	1
the	1
market--got	1
it	1
off	1
for	1
fresh	1
just	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
river--got	1
twice	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
the	1
market	1
price	1
for	1
it;	1
and	1
from	1
whom,	1
think	1
you?	1
Why,	1
from	1
the	1
very	1
booby	1
that	1
would	1
have	1
bought	1
the	1
bruised	1
melon	1
for	1
a	1
sound	1
one	1
if	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
let	1
him.	1
You'll	1
allow	1
I'm	1
no	1
fool,	1
Francisco,	1
and	1
that	1
I'm	1
in	1
a	1
fair	1
way	1
to	1
grow	1
rich,	1
if	1
I	1
go	1
on	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
begun."	1
"Stay,"	1
said	1
Francisco;	1
"you	1
forgot	1
that	1
the	1
booby	1
you	1
took	1
in	1
to-day	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
so	1
easily	1
taken	1
in	1
to-morrow.	1
He	1
will	1
buy	1
no	1
more	1
fish	1
from	1
you,	1
because	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
afraid	1
of	1
your	1
cheating	1
him;	1
but	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
ready	1
enough	1
to	1
buy	1
fruit	1
from	1
me,	1
because	1
he	1
will	1
know	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
cheat	1
him--	1
so	1
you'll	1
have	1
lost	1
a	1
customer,	1
and	1
I	1
gained	1
one."	1
"With	1
all	1
my	1
heart,"	1
said	1
Piedro.	1
"One	1
customer	1
does	1
not	1
make	1
a	1
market;	1
if	1
he	1
buys	1
no	1
more	1
from	1
me,	1
what	1
care	1
I?	1
there	1
are	1
people	1
enough	1
to	1
buy	1
fish	1
in	1
Naples."	1
"And	1
do	1
you	1
mean	1
to	1
serve	1
them	1
all	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
manner?"	1
asked	1
Francisco.	1
"If	1
they	1
will	1
be	1
only	1
so	1
good	1
as	1
to	1
give	1
me	1
leave,"	1
said	1
Piedro,	1
laughing,	1
and	1
repeating	1
his	1
father's	1
proverb,	1
"'Venture	1
a	1
small	1
fish	1
to	1
catch	1
a	1
large	1
one.'"	1
*	1
He	1
had	1
learned	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
to	1
cheat	1
in	1
making	1
bargains	1
was	1
witty	1
and	1
clever.	1
*	1
see	1
anted.	1
"And	1
you	1
have	1
never	1
considered,	1
then,"	1
said	1
Francisco,	1
"that	1
all	1
these	1
people	1
will,	1
one	1
after	1
another,	1
find	1
you	1
out	1
in	1
time?"	1
"Ay,	1
in	1
time;	1
but	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
some	1
time	1
first.	1
There	1
are	1
a	1
great	1
many	1
of	1
them,	1
enough	1
to	1
last	1
me	1
all	1
the	1
summer,	1
if	1
I	1
lose	1
a	1
customer	1
a	1
day,"	1
said	1
Piedro.	1
"And	1
next	1
summer,"	1
observed	1
Francisco,	1
"what	1
will	1
you	1
do?"	1
"Next	1
summer	1
is	1
not	1
come	1
yet;	1
there	1
is	1
time	1
enough	1
to	1
think	1
what	1
I	1
shall	1
do	1
before	1
next	1
summer	1
comes.	1
Why,	1
now,	1
suppose	1
the	1
blockheads,	1
after	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
taken	1
in	1
and	1
found	1
it	1
out,	1
all	1
joined	1
against	1
me,	1
and	1
would	1
buy	1
none	1
of	1
our	1
fish--what	1
then?	1
Are	1
there	1
no	1
trades	1
but	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
fisherman?	1
In	1
Naples,	1
are	1
there	1
not	1
a	1
hundred	1
ways	1
of	1
making	1
money	1
for	1
a	1
smart	1
lad	1
like	1
me?	1
as	1
my	1
father	1
says.	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
of	1
turning	1
merchant,	1
and	1
selling	1
sugar-plums	1
and	1
cakes	1
to	1
the	1
children	1
in	1
their	1
market?	1
Would	1
they	1
be	1
hard	1
to	1
deal	1
with,	1
think	1
you?"	1
"I	1
think	1
not,"	1
said	1
Francisco;	1
"but	1
I	1
think	1
the	1
children	1
would	1
find	1
out	1
in	1
time	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
cheated,	1
and	1
would	1
like	1
it	1
as	1
little	1
as	1
the	1
men."	1
"I	1
don't	1
doubt	1
them.	1
Then	1
IN	1
TIME	1
I	1
could,	1
you	1
know,	1
change	1
my	1
trade--	1
sell	1
chips	1
and	1
sticks	1
in	1
the	1
wood-market--hand	1
about	1
the	1
lemonade	1
to	1
the	1
fine	1
folks,	1
or	1
twenty	1
other	1
things.	1
There	1
are	1
trades	1
enough,	1
boy."	1
"Yes,	1
for	1
the	1
honest	1
dealer,"	1
said	1
Francisco,	1
"but	1
for	1
no	1
other;	1
for	1
in	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
you'll	1
find,	1
as	1
MY	1
father	1
says,	1
that	1
a	1
good	1
character	1
is	1
the	1
best	1
fortune	1
to	1
set	1
up	1
with.	1
Change	1
your	1
trade	1
ever	1
so	1
often,	1
you'll	1
be	1
found	1
out	1
for	1
what	1
you	1
are	1
at	1
last."	1
"And	1
what	1
am	1
I,	1
pray?"	1
said	1
Piedro,	1
angrily.	1
"The	1
whole	1
truth	1
of	1
the	1
matter	1
is,	1
Francisco,	1
that	1
you	1
envy	1
my	1
good	1
luck,	1
and	1
can't	1
bear	1
to	1
hear	1
this	1
money	1
jingle	1
in	1
my	1
hand.	1
Ay,	1
stroke	1
the	1
long	1
ears	1
of	1
your	1
ass,	1
and	1
look	1
as	1
wise	1
as	1
you	1
please.	1
It's	1
better	1
to	1
be	1
lucky	1
than	1
wise,	1
as	1
MY	1
father	1
says.	1
Good	1
morning	1
to	1
you.	1
When	1
I	1
am	1
found	1
out	1
for	1
what	1
I	1
am,	1
or	1
when	1
the	1
worst	1
comes	1
to	1
the	1
worst,	1
I	1
can	1
drive	1
a	1
stupid	1
ass,	1
with	1
his	1
panniers	1
filled	1
with	1
rubbish,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
you	1
do	1
now,	1
HONEST	1
FRANCISCO."	1
"Not	1
quite	1
so	1
well.	1
Unless	1
you	1
were	1
HONEST	1
FRANCISCO,	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
fill	1
his	1
panniers	1
quite	1
so	1
readily.".	1
This	1
was	1
certain,	1
that	1
Francisco	1
was	1
so	1
well	1
known	1
for	1
his	1
honesty	1
amongst	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
at	1
Naples	1
with	1
whom	1
his	1
father	1
was	1
acquainted,	1
that	1
everyone	1
was	1
glad	1
to	1
deal	1
with	1
him;	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
never	1
wronged	1
anyone,	1
all	1
were	1
willing	1
to	1
serve	1
him--at	1
least,	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
they	1
could	1
without	1
loss	1
to	1
themselves:	1
so	1
that	1
after	1
the	1
market	1
was	1
over,	1
his	1
panniers	1
were	1
regularly	1
filled	1
by	1
the	1
gardeners	1
and	1
others	1
with	1
whatever	1
he	1
wanted.	1
His	1
industry	1
was	1
constant,	1
his	1
gains	1
small	1
but	1
certain,	1
and	1
he	1
every	1
day	1
had	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
reason	1
to	1
trust	1
to	1
his	1
father's	1
maxim--That	1
honesty	1
is	1
the	1
best	1
policy.	1
The	1
foreign	1
servant	1
lad,	1
to	1
whom	1
Francisco	1
had	1
so	1
honestly,	1
or,	1
as	1
Piedro	1
said,	1
so	1
sillily,	1
shown	1
the	1
bruised	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
melon,	1
was	1
an	1
Englishman.	1
He	1
left	1
his	1
native	1
country,	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
extremely	1
fond,	1
to	1
attend	1
upon	1
his	1
master,	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
was	1
still	1
more	1
attached.	1
His	1
master	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
declining	1
state	1
of	1
health,	1
and	1
this	1
young	1
lad	1
waited	1
on	1
him	1
a	1
little	1
more	1
to	1
his	1
mind	1
than	1
his	1
other	1
servants.	1
We	1
must,	1
in	1
consideration	1
of	1
his	1
zeal,	1
fidelity	1
and	1
inexperience,	1
pardon	1
him	1
for	1
not	1
being	1
a	1
good	1
judge	1
of	1
fish.	1
Though	1
he	1
had	1
simplicity	1
enough	1
to	1
be	1
easily	1
cheated	1
once,	1
he	1
had	1
too	1
much	1
sense	1
to	1
be	1
twice	1
made	1
a	1
dupe.	1
The	1
next	1
time	1
he	1
met	1
Piedro	1
in	1
the	1
market,	1
he	1
happened	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
company	1
with	1
several	1
English	1
gentlemen's	1
servants,	1
and	1
he	1
pointed	1
Piedro	1
out	1
to	1
them	1
all	1
as	1
an	1
arrant	1
knave.	1
They	1
heard	1
his	1
cry	1
of	1
"Fresh	1
fish!	1
fresh	1
fish!	1
fine	1
fresh	1
fish!"	1
with	1
incredulous	1
smiles,	1
and	1
let	1
him	1
pass,	1
but	1
not	1
without	1
some	1
expressions	1
of	1
contempt,	1
though	1
uttered	1
in	1
English,	1
he	1
tolerably	1
well	1
understood;	1
for	1
the	1
tone	1
of	1
contempt	1
is	1
sufficiently	1
expressive	1
in	1
all	1
languages.	1
He	1
lost	1
more	1
by	1
not	1
selling	1
his	1
fish	1
to	1
these	1
people	1
than	1
he	1
had	1
gained	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
by	1
cheating	1
the	1
ENGLISH	1
BOOBY.	1
The	1
market	1
was	1
well	1
supplied,	1
and	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
get	1
rid	1
of	1
his	1
cargo.	1
"Is	1
not	1
this	1
truly	1
provoking?"	1
said	1
Piedro,	1
as	1
he	1
passed	1
by	1
Francisco,	1
who	1
was	1
selling	1
fruit	1
for	1
his	1
father.	1
"Look,	1
my	1
basket	1
is	1
as	1
heavy	1
as	1
when	1
I	1
left	1
home	1
and	1
look	1
at	1
'em	1
yourself,	1
they	1
really	1
are	1
fine	1
fresh	1
fish	1
to-day	1
and	1
yet,	1
because	1
that	1
revengeful	1
booby	1
told	1
how	1
I	1
took	1
him	1
in	1
yesterday,	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
yonder	1
crowd	1
would	1
buy	1
them;	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
they	1
really	1
are	1
fresh	1
to-day!"	1
"So	1
they	1
are,"	1
said	1
Franscisco,	1
"but	1
you	1
said	1
so	1
yesterday,	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
not;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
was	1
duped	1
then,	1
is	1
not	1
ready	1
to	1
believe	1
you	1
to-day.	1
How	1
does	1
he	1
know	1
that	1
you	1
deserve	1
it	1
better?"	1
"He	1
might	1
have	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
fish,"	1
repeated	1
Piedro;	1
"they	1
are	1
fresh	1
to-	1
day.	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
he	1
need	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
afraid."	1
"Ay,"	1
said	1
Francisco;	1
"but	1
as	1
my	1
father	1
said	1
to	1
you	1
once--the	1
scalded	1
dog	1
fears	1
cold	1
water."	1

Here	1
their	1
conversation	1
was	1
interrupted	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
English	1
lad,	1
who	1
smiled	1
as	1
he	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
Francisco,	1
and	1
taking	1
up	1
a	1
fine	1
pine-apple,	1
he	1
said,	1
in	1
a	1
mixture	1
of	1
bad	1
Italian	1
and	1
English--"I	1
need	1
not	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
this;	1
you	1
will	1
tell	1
me	1
if	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
as	1
good	1
as	1
it	1
looks.	1
Name	1
your	1
price;	1
I	1
know	1
you	1
have	1
but	1
one,	1
and	1
that	1
an	1
honest	1
one;	1
and	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
rest,	1
I	1
am	1
able	1
and	1
willing	1
to	1
pay	1
for	1
what	1
I	1
buy;	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
my	1
master	1
is,	1
which	1
comes	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
thing.	1
I	1
wish	1
your	1
fruit	1
could	1
make	1
him	1
well,	1
and	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
worth	1
its	1
weight	1
in	1
gold	1
to	1
me,	1
at	1
least.	1
We	1
must	1
have	1
some	1
of	1
your	1
grapes	1
for	1
him."	1
"Is	1
he	1
not	1
well?"	1
inquired	1
Francisco.	1
"We	1
must,	1
then,	1
pick	1
out	1
the	1
best	1
for	1
him,"	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
singling	1
out	1
a	1
tempting	1
bunch.	1
"I	1
hope	1
he	1
will	1
like	1
these;	1
but	1
if	1
you	1
could	1
some	1
day	1
come	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
Resina	1
(it	1
is	1
a	1
village	1
but	1
a	1
few	1
miles	1
out	1
of	1
town,	1
where	1
we	1
have	1
our	1
vineyard),	1
you	1
could	1
there	1
choose	1
for	1
yourself,	1
and	1
pluck	1
them	1
fresh	1
from	1
the	1
vines	1
for	1
your	1
poor	1
master."	1
"Bless	1
you,	1
my	1
good	1
boy;	1
I	1
should	1
take	1
you	1
for	1
an	1
Englishman,	1
by	1
your	1
way	1
of	1
dealing.	1
I'll	1
come	1
to	1
your	1
village.	1
Only	1
write	1
me	1
down	1
the	1
name;	1
for	1
your	1
Italian	1
names	1
slip	1
through	1
my	1
head.	1
I'll	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
vineyard	1
if	1
it	1
was	1
ten	1
miles	1
off;	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
we	1
stay	1
in	1
Naples	1
(may	1
it	1
not	1
be	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
I	1
fear	1
it	1
will!),	1
with	1
my	1
master's	1
leave,	1
which	1
he	1
never	1
refuses	1
me	1
to	1
anything	1
that's	1
proper,	1
I'll	1
deal	1
with	1
you	1
for	1
all	1
our	1
fruit,	1
as	1
sure	1
as	1
my	1
name's	1
Arthur,	1
and	1
with	1
none	1
else,	1
with	1
my	1
good	1
will.	1
I	1
wish	1
all	1
your	1
countrymen	1
would	1
take	1
after	1
you	1
in	1
honesty,	1
indeed	1
I	1
do,"	1
concluded	1
the	1
Englishman,	1
looking	1
full	1
at	1
Piedro,	1
who	1
took	1
up	1
his	1
unsold	1
basket	1
of	1
fish,	1
looking	1
somewhat	1
silly,	1
and	1
gloomily	1
walked	1
off.	1
Arthur,	1
the	1
English	1
servant,	1
was	1
as	1
good	1
as	1
his	1
word.	1
He	1
dealt	1
constantly	1
with	1
Francisco,	1
and	1
proved	1
an	1
excellent	1
customer,	1
buying	1
from	1
him	1
during	1
the	1
whole	1
season	1
as	1
much	1
fruit	1
as	1
his	1
master	1
wanted.	1
His	1
master,	1
who	1
was	1
an	1
Englishman	1
of	1
distinction,	1
was	1
invited	1
to	1
take	1
up	1
his	1
residence,	1
during	1
his	1
stay	1
in	1
Italy,	1
at	1
the	1
Count	1
de	1
F.'s	1
villa,	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
environs	1
of	1
Naples--an	1
easy	1
walk	1
from	1
Resina.	1
Francisco	1
had	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
seeing	1
his	1
father's	1
vineyard	1
often	1
full	1
of	1
generous	1
visitors,	1
and	1
Arthur,	1
who	1
had	1
circulated	1
the	1
anecdote	1
of	1
the	1
bruised	1
melon,	1
was,	1
he	1
said,	1
"proud	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
some	1
of	1
this	1
was	1
his	1
doing,	1
and	1
that	1
an	1
Englishman	1
never	1
forgot	1
a	1
good	1
turn,	1
be	1
it	1
from	1
a	1
countryman	1
or	1
foreigner."	1
"My	1
dear	1
boy,"	1
said	1
Francisco's	1
father	1
to	1
him,	1
whilst	1
Arthur	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
vineyard	1
helping	1
to	1
tend	1
the	1
vines,	1
"I	1
am	1
to	1
thank	1
you	1
and	1
your	1
honesty,	1
it	1
seems,	1
for	1
our	1
having	1
our	1
hands	1
so	1
full	1
of	1
business	1
this	1
season.	1
It	1
is	1
fair	1
you	1
should	1
have	1
a	1
share	1
of	1
our	1
profits."	1
"So	1
I	1
have,	1
father,	1
enough	1
and	1
enough,	1
when	1
I	1
see	1
you	1
and	1
mother	1
going	1
on	1
so	1
well.	1
What	1
can	1
I	1
want	1
more?"	1
"Oh,	1
my	1
brave	1
boy,	1
we	1
know	1
you	1
are	1
a	1
grateful,	1
good	1
son;	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
your	1
age	1
myself;	1
you	1
have	1
companions,	1
you	1
have	1
little	1
expenses	1
of	1
your	1
own.	1
Here;	1
this	1
vine,	1
this	1
fig-tree,	1
and	1
a	1
melon	1
a	1
week	1
next	1
summer	1
shall	1
be	1
yours.	1
With	1
these	1
make	1
a	1
fine	1
figure	1
amongst	1
the	1
little	1
Neapolitan	1
merchants;	1
and	1
all	1
I	1
wish	1
is	1
that	1
you	1
may	1
prosper	1
as	1
well,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
honest	1
means,	1
in	1
managing	1
for	1
yourself,	1
as	1
you	1
have	1
done	1
managing	1
for	1
me."	1
"Thank	1
you,	1
father;	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
prosper	1
at	1
all,	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
by	1
those	1
means,	1
and	1
no	1
other,	1
or	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
worthy	1
to	1
be	1
called	1
your	1
son."	1
Piedro	1
the	1
cunning	1
did	1
not	1
make	1
quite	1
so	1
successful	1
a	1
summer's	1
work	1
as	1
did	1
Francisco	1
the	1
honest.	1
No	1
extraordinary	1
events	1
happened,	1
no	1
singular	1
instance	1
of	1
bad	1
or	1
good	1
luck	1
occurred;	1
but	1
he	1
felt,	1
as	1
persons	1
usually	1
do,	1
the	1
natural	1
consequences	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
actions.	1
He	1
pursued	1
his	1
scheme	1
of	1
imposing,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
he	1
could,	1
upon	1
every	1
person	1
he	1
dealt	1
with;	1
and	1
the	1
consequence	1
was,	1
that	1
at	1
last	1
nobody	1
would	1
deal	1
with	1
him.	1
"It	1
is	1
easy	1
to	1
outwit	1
one	1
person,	1
but	1
impossible	1
to	1
outwit	1
all	1
the	1
world,"	1
said	1
a	1
man	1
*	1
who	1
knew	1
the	1
world	1
at	1
least	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
either	1
Piedro	1
or	1
his	1
father.	1
*	1
The	1
Duke	1
de	1
Rochefoucault.--"On	1
peut	1
etre	1
puls	1
fin	1
qu'un	1
autre,	1
mais	1
pas	1
plus	1
fin	1
que	1
tous	1
les	1
autres."	1
Piedro's	1
father,	1
amongst	1
others,	1
had	1
reason	1
to	1
complain.	1
He	1
saw	1
his	1
own	1
customers	1
fall	1
off	1
from	1
him,	1
and	1
was	1
told,	1
whenever	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
market,	1
that	1
his	1
son	1
was	1
such	1
a	1
cheat	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
dealing	1
with	1
him.	1
One	1
day,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
returning	1
from	1
the	1
market	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
bad	1
humour,	1
in	1
consequence	1
of	1
these	1
reproaches,	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
not	1
having	1
found	1
customers	1
for	1
his	1
goods,	1
he	1
espied	1
his	1
SMART	1
son	1
Piedro	1
at	1
a	1
little	1
merchant's	1
fruit-board	1
devouring	1
a	1
fine	1
gourd	1
with	1
prodigious	1
greediness.	1
"Where,	1
glutton,	1
do	1
you	1
find	1
money	1
to	1
pay	1
for	1
these	1
dainties?"	1
exclaimed	1
his	1
father,	1
coming	1
close	1
up	1
to	1
him,	1
with	1
angry	1
gestures.	1
Piedro's	1
mouth	1
was	1
much	1
too	1
full	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
immediate	1
reply,	1
nor	1
did	1
his	1
father	1
wait	1
for	1
any,	1
but	1
darting	1
his	1
hand	1
into	1
the	1
youth's	1
pocket,	1
pulled	1
forth	1
a	1
handful	1
of	1
silver.	1
"The	1
money,	1
father,"	1
said	1
Piedro,	1
"that	1
I	1
got	1
for	1
the	1
fish	1
yesterday,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
meant	1
to	1
give	1
you	1
to-day,	1
before	1
you	1
went	1
out."	1
"Then	1
I'll	1
make	1
you	1
remember	1
it	1
against	1
another	1
time,	1
sirrah!"	1
said	1
his	1
father.	1
"I'll	1
teach	1
you	1
to	1
fill	1
your	1
stomach	1
with	1
my	1
money.	1
Am	1
I	1
to	1
lose	1
my	1
customers	1
by	1
your	1
tricks,	1
and	1
then	1
find	1
you	1
here	1
eating	1
my	1
all?	1
You	1
are	1
a	1
rogue,	1
and	1
everybody	1
has	1
found	1
you	1
out	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
rogue;	1
and	1
the	1
worst	1
of	1
rogues	1
I	1
find	1
you,	1
who	1
scruples	1
not	1
to	1
cheat	1
his	1
own	1
father."	1
Saying	1
these	1
words,	1
with	1
great	1
vehemence	1
he	1
seized	1
hold	1
of	1
Piedro,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
fruit-market	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
severe	1
beating.	1
This	1
beating	1
did	1
the	1
boy	1
no	1
good;	1
it	1
was	1
vengeance	1
not	1
punishment.	1
Piedro	1
saw	1
that	1
his	1
father	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
passion,	1
and	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
beaten	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
found	1
out	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
rogue,	1
rather	1
than	1
for	1
being	1
one.	1
He	1
recollected	1
perfectly	1
that	1
his	1
father	1
once	1
said	1
to	1
him:	1
"Let	1
everyone	1
take	1
care	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
grapes."	1
Indeed	1
it	1
was	1
scarcely	1
reasonable	1
to	1
expect	1
that	1
a	1
boy	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
educated	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
cheat	1
every	1
customer	1
he	1
could	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
trade,	1
should	1
be	1
afterwards	1
scrupulously	1
honest	1
in	1
his	1
conduct	1
towards	1
the	1
father	1
whose	1
proverbs	1
encouraged	1
his	1
childhood	1
in	1
cunning.	1
Piedro	1
writhed	1
with	1
bodily	1
pain	1
as	1
he	1
left	1
the	1
market	1
after	1
his	1
drubbing,	1
but	1
his	1
mind	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
amended.	1
On	1
the	1
contrary,	1
he	1
was	1
hardened	1
to	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
shame	1
by	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
reputation.	1
All	1
the	1
little	1
merchants	1
were	1
spectators	1
of	1
this	1
scene,	1
and	1
heard	1
his	1
father's	1
words:	1
"You	1
ARE	1
a	1
rogue,	1
and	1
the	1
worst	1
of	1
rogues,	1
who	1
scruples	1
not	1
to	1
cheat	1
his	1
own	1
father."	1
These	1
words	1
were	1
long	1
remembered,	1
and	1
long	1
did	1
Piedro	1
feel	1
their	1
effects.	1
He	1
once	1
flattered	1
himself	1
that,	1
when	1
his	1
trade	1
of	1
selling	1
fish	1
failed	1
him,	1
he	1
could	1
readily	1
engage	1
in	1
some	1
other;	1
but	1
he	1
now	1
found,	1
to	1
his	1
mortification,	1
that	1
what	1
Francisco's	1
father	1
said	1
proved	1
true:	1
"In	1
all	1
trades	1
the	1
best	1
fortune	1
to	1
set	1
up	1
with	1
is	1
a	1
good	1
character."	1
Not	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
Neapolitan	1
merchants	1
would	1
either	1
enter	1
into	1
partnership	1
with	1
him,	1
give	1
him	1
credit,	1
or	1
even	1
trade	1
with	1
him	1
for	1
ready	1
money.	1
"If	1
you	1
would	1
cheat	1
your	1
own	1
father,	1
to	1
be	1
sure	1
you	1
will	1
cheat	1
us,"	1
was	1
continually	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
by	1
these	1
prudent	1
little	1
people.	1
Piedro	1
was	1
taunted	1
and	1
treated	1
with	1
contempt	1
at	1
home	1
and	1
abroad.	1
His	1
father,	1
when	1
he	1
found	1
that	1
his	1
son's	1
smartness	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
useful	1
in	1
making	1
bargains,	1
shoved	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
way	1
whenever	1
he	1
met	1
him.	1
All	1
the	1
food	1
or	1
clothes	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
at	1
home	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
given	1
to	1
him	1
grudgingly,	1
and	1
with	1
such	1
expressions	1
as	1
these:	1
"Take	1
that;	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
too	1
good	1
for	1
you.	1
You	1
must	1
eat	1
this,	1
now,	1
instead	1
of	1
gourds	1
and	1
figs--and	1
be	1
thankful	1
you	1
have	1
even	1
this."	1
Piedro	1
spent	1
a	1
whole	1
winter	1
very	1
unhappily.	1
He	1
expected	1
that	1
all	1
his	1
old	1
tricks,	1
and	1
especially	1
what	1
his	1
father	1
had	1
said	1
of	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
market-	1
place,	1
would	1
be	1
soon	1
forgotten;	1
but	1
month	1
passed	1
after	1
month,	1
and	1
still	1
these	1
things	1
were	1
fresh	1
in	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
all	1
who	1
had	1
known	1
them.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
easy	1
to	1
get	1
rid	1
of	1
a	1
bad	1
character.	1
A	1
very	1
great	1
rogue	1
*	1
was	1
once	1
heard	1
to	1
say,	1
that	1
he	1
would,	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
heart,	1
give	1
ten	1
thousand	1
pounds	1
for	1
a	1
good	1
character,	1
because	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
make	1
twenty	1
thousand	1
by	1
it.	1
*	1
Chartres.	1
Something	1
like	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
sentiment	1
of	1
our	1
cunning	1
hero	1
when	1
he	1
experienced	1
the	1
evils	1
of	1
a	1
bad	1
reputation,	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
numerous	1
advantages	1
which	1
Francisco's	1
good	1
character	1
procured.	1
Such	1
had	1
been	1
Piedro's	1
wretched	1
education,	1
that	1
even	1
the	1
hard	1
lessons	1
of	1
experience	1
could	1
not	1
alter	1
its	1
pernicious	1
effects.	1
He	1
was	1
sorry	1
his	1
knavery	1
had	1
been	1
detected,	1
but	1
he	1
still	1
thought	1
it	1
clever	1
to	1
cheat,	1
and	1
was	1
secretly	1
persuaded	1
that,	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
cheated	1
successfully,	1
he	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
happy.	1
"But	1
I	1
know	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
happy	1
now,"	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
himself	1
one	1
morning,	1
as	1
he	1
sat	1
alone	1
disconsolate	1
by	1
the	1
sea-shore,	1
dressed	1
in	1
tattered	1
garments,	1
weak	1
and	1
hungry,	1
with	1
an	1
empty	1
basket	1
beside	1
him.	1
His	1
fishing-	1
rod,	1
which	1
he	1
held	1
between	1
his	1
knees,	1
bent	1
over	1
the	1
dry	1
sands	1
instead	1
of	1
into	1
the	1
water,	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
thinking	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
about;	1
his	1
arms	1
were	1
folded,	1
his	1
head	1
hung	1
down,	1
and	1
his	1
ragged	1
hat	1
was	1
slouched	1
over	1
his	1
face.	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
melancholy	1
spectacle.	1
Francisco,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
coming	1
from	1
his	1
father's	1
vineyard	1
with	1
a	1
large	1
dish	1
of	1
purple	1
and	1
white	1
grapes	1
upon	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
a	1
basket	1
of	1
melons	1
and	1
figs	1
hanging	1
upon	1
his	1
arm,	1
chanced	1
to	1
see	1
Piedro	1
seated	1
in	1
this	1
melancholy	1
posture.	1
Touched	1
with	1
compassion,	1
Francisco	1
approached	1
him	1
softly;	1
his	1
footsteps	1
were	1
not	1
heard	1
upon	1
the	1
sands,	1
and	1
Piedro	1
did	1
not	1
perceive	1
that	1
anyone	1
was	1
near	1
him	1
till	1
he	1
felt	1
something	1
cold	1
touch	1
his	1
hand;	1
he	1
then	1
started,	1
and,	1
looking	1
up,	1
saw	1
a	1
bunch	1
of	1
grapes,	1
which	1
Francisco	1
was	1
holding	1
over	1
his	1
head.	1
"Eat	1
them:	1
you'll	1
find	1
them	1
very	1
good,	1
I	1
hope,"	1
said	1
Francisco,	1
with	1
a	1
benevolent	1
smile.	1
"They	1
are	1
excellent--most	1
excellent,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
much	1
obliged	1
to	1
you,	1
Francisco,"	1
said	1
Piedro.	1
"I	1
was	1
very	1
hungry,	1
and	1
that's	1
what	1
I	1
am	1
now,	1
without	1
anybody's	1
caring	1
anything	1
about	1
it.	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
the	1
favourite	1
I	1
was	1
with	1
my	1
father,	1
but	1
I	1
know	1
it	1
is	1
all	1
my	1
own	1
fault."	1
"Well,	1
but	1
cheer	1
up,"	1
said	1
Francisco;	1
"my	1
father	1
always	1
says,	1
'One	1
who	1
knows	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
in	1
fault,	1
and	1
acknowledges	1
it,	1
will	1
scarcely	1
be	1
in	1
fault	1
again.'	1
Yes,	1
take	1
as	1
many	1
figs	1
as	1
you	1
will,"	1
continued	1
he;	1
and	1
held	1
his	1
basket	1
closer	1
to	1
Piedro,	1
who,	1
as	1
he	1
saw,	1
cast	1
a	1
hungry	1
eye	1
upon	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
ripe	1
figs.	1
"But,"	1
said	1
Piedro,	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
several,	1
"shall	1
not	1
I	1
get	1
you	1
into	1
a	1
scrape	1
by	1
taking	1
so	1
many?	1
Won't	1
your	1
father	1
be	1
apt	1
to	1
miss	1
them?"	1
"Do	1
you	1
think	1
I	1
would	1
give	1
them	1
to	1
you	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
my	1
own?"	1
said	1
Francisco,	1
with	1
a	1
sudden	1
glance	1
of	1
indignation.	1
"Well,	1
don't	1
be	1
angry	1
that	1
I	1
asked	1
the	1
question;	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
from	1
fear	1
of	1
getting	1
you	1
into	1
disgrace	1
that	1
I	1
asked	1
it."	1
"It	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
easy	1
for	1
anybody	1
to	1
do	1
that,	1
I	1
hope,"	1
said	1
Francisco,	1
rather	1
proudly.	1
"And	1
to	1
me	1
less	1
than	1
anybody,"	1
replied	1
Piedro,	1
in	1
an	1
insinuating	1
tone,	1
"_I,_	1
that	1
am	1
so	1
much	1
obliged	1
to	1
you!"	1
"A	1
bunch	1
of	1
grapes,	1
and	1
a	1
few	1
figs,	1
are	1
no	1
mighty	1
obligation,"	1
said	1
Francisco,	1
smiling;	1
"I	1
wish	1
I	1
could	1
do	1
more	1
for	1
you.	1
You	1
seem,	1
indeed,	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
very	1
unhappy	1
of	1
late.	1
We	1
never	1
see	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
markets	1
as	1
we	1
used	1
to	1
do."	1
"No;	1
ever	1
since	1
my	1
father	1
beat	1
me,	1
and	1
called	1
me	1
rogue	1
before	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
there,	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
show	1
my	1
face	1
without	1
being	1
gibed	1
at	1
by	1
one	1
or	1
t'other.	1
If	1
you	1
would	1
but	1
take	1
me	1
along	1
with	1
you	1
amongst	1
them,	1
and	1
only	1
just	1
SEEM	1
my	1
friend,	1
for	1
a	1
day	1
or	1
two,	1
or	1
so,	1
it	1
would	1
quite	1
set	1
me	1
up	1
again;	1
for	1
they	1
all	1
like	1
you."	1
"I	1
would	1
rather	1
BE	1
than	1
seem	1
your	1
friend,	1
if	1
I	1
could,"	1
said	1
Francisco.	1
"Ay,	1
to	1
be	1
sure;	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
still	1
better,"	1
said	1
Piedro,	1
observing	1
that	1
Francisco,	1
as	1
he	1
uttered	1
his	1
last	1
sentence,	1
was	1
separating	1
the	1
grapes	1
and	1
other	1
fruits	1
into	1
two	1
equal	1
divisions.	1
"To	1
be	1
sure	1
I	1
would	1
rather	1
you	1
would	1
BE	1
than	1
SEEM	1
a	1
friend	1
to	1
me;	1
but	1
I	1
thought	1
that	1
was	1
too	1
much	1
to	1
ask	1
at	1
first,	1
though	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
notion,	1
notwithstanding	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
so	1
UNLUCKY	1
lately--I	1
have	1
a	1
notion	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
no	1
reason	1
to	1
repent	1
of	1
it.	1
You	1
would	1
find	1
me	1
no	1
bad	1
hand,	1
if	1
you	1
were	1
to	1
try,	1
and	1
take	1
me	1
into	1
partnership."	1
"Partnership!"	1
interrupted	1
Francisco,	1
drawing	1
back	1
alarmed;	1
"I	1
had	1
no	1
thoughts	1
of	1
that."	1
"But	1
won't	1
you?	1
can't	1
you?"	1
said	1
Piedro,	1
in	1
a	1
supplicating	1
tone;	1
"CAN'T	1
you	1
have	1
thoughts	1
of	1
it?	1
You'd	1
find	1
me	1
a	1
very	1
active	1
partner."	1
Franscisco	1
still	1
drew	1
back,	1
and	1
kept	1
his	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
upon	1
the	1
ground.	1
He	1
was	1
embarrassed;	1
for	1
he	1
pitied	1
Piedro,	1
and	1
he	1
scarcely	1
knew	1
how	1
to	1
point	1
out	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
something	1
more	1
is	1
necessary	1
in	1
a	1
partner	1
in	1
trade	1
besides	1
activity,	1
and	1
that	1
is	1
honesty.	1
"Can't	1
you?"	1
repeated	1
Piedro,	1
thinking	1
that	1
he	1
hesitated	1
from	1
merely	1
mercenary	1
motives.	1
"You	1
shall	1
have	1
what	1
share	1
of	1
the	1
profits	1
you	1
please."	1
"I	1
was	1
not	1
thinking	1
of	1
the	1
profits,"	1
said	1
Francisco;	1
"but	1
without	1
meaning	1
to	1
be	1
ill-natured	1
to	1
you,	1
Piedro,	1
I	1
must	1
say	1
that	1
I	1
cannot	1
enter	1
into	1
any	1
partnership	1
with	1
you	1
at	1
present;	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
what,	1
perhaps,	1
you	1
will	1
like	1
as	1
well,"	1
said	1
he,	1
taking	1
half	1
the	1
fruit	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
basket;	1
"you	1
are	1
heartily	1
welcome	1
to	1
this;	1
try	1
and	1
sell	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
children's	1
fruit	1
market.	1
I'll	1
go	1
on	1
before	1
you,	1
and	1
speak	1
to	1
those	1
I	1
am	1
acquainted	1
with,	1
and	1
tell	1
them	1
you	1
are	1
going	1
to	1
set	1
up	1
a	1
new	1
character,	1
and	1
that	1
you	1
hope	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
a	1
good	1
one."	1
"Hey,	1
shall	1
I!	1
Thank	1
you	1
for	1
ever,	1
dear	1
Francisco,"	1
cried	1
Piedro,	1
seizing	1
his	1
plentiful	1
gift	1
of	1
fruit.	1
"Say	1
what	1
you	1
please	1
for	1
me."	1
"But	1
don't	1
make	1
me	1
say	1
anything	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
true,"	1
said	1
Francisco,	1
pausing.	1
"No,	1
to	1
be	1
sure	1
not,"	1
said	1
Piedro;	1
"I	1
DO	1
mean	1
to	1
give	1
no	1
room	1
for	1
scandal.	1
If	1
I	1
could	1
get	1
them	1
to	1
trust	1
me	1
as	1
they	1
do	1
you,	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
happy	1
indeed."	1
"That	1
is	1
what	1
you	1
may	1
do,	1
if	1
you	1
please,"	1
said	1
Francisco.	1
"Adieu,	1
I	1
wish	1
you	1
well	1
with	1
all	1
my	1
heart;	1
but	1
I	1
must	1
leave	1
you	1
now,	1
or	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
too	1
late	1
for	1
the	1
market."	1
CHAPTER	1
II.	1
Chi	1
va	1
piano	1
va	1
sano,	1
e	1
anche	1
lontano.	1
Fair	1
and	1
softly	1
goes	1
far	1
in	1
a	1
day.	1
Piedro	1
had	1
now	1
an	1
opportunity	1
of	1
establishing	1
a	1
good	1
character.	1
When	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
market	1
with	1
his	1
grapes	1
and	1
figs,	1
he	1
found	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
shunned	1
or	1
taunted	1
as	1
usual.	1
All	1
seemed	1
disposed	1
to	1
believe	1
in	1
his	1
intended	1
reformation,	1
and	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
a	1
fair	1
trial.	1
These	1
favourable	1
dispositions	1
towards	1
him	1
were	1
the	1
consequence	1
of	1
Francisco's	1
benevolent	1
representations.	1
He	1
told	1
them	1
that	1
he	1
thought	1
Piedro	1
had	1
suffered	1
enough	1
to	1
cure	1
him	1
of	1
his	1
tricks,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
cruelty	1
in	1
them,	1
because	1
he	1
might	1
once	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
fault,	1
to	1
banish	1
him	1
by	1
their	1
reproaches	1
from	1
amongst	1
them,	1
and	1
thus	1
to	1
prevent	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
gaining	1
his	1
livelihood	1
honestly.	1
Piedro	1
made	1
a	1
good	1
beginning,	1
and	1
gave	1
what	1
several	1
of	1
the	1
younger	1
customers	1
thought	1
excellent	1
bargains.	1
His	1
grapes	1
and	1
figs	1
were	1
quickly	1
sold,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
money	1
that	1
he	1
got	1
for	1
them	1
he	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
purchased	1
from	1
a	1
fruit	1
dealer	1
a	1
fresh	1
supply;	1
and	1
thus	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
for	1
some	1
time,	1
conducting	1
himself	1
with	1
scrupulous	1
honesty,	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
acquired	1
some	1
credit	1
among	1
his	1
companions.	1
They	1
no	1
longer	1
watched	1
him	1
with	1
suspicious	1
eyes.	1
They	1
trusted	1
to	1
his	1
measures	1
and	1
weights,	1
and	1
they	1
counted	1
less	1
carefully	1
the	1
change	1
which	1
they	1
received	1
from	1
him.	1
The	1
satisfaction	1
he	1
felt	1
from	1
this	1
alteration	1
in	1
their	1
manners	1
was	1
at	1
first	1
delightful	1
to	1
Piedro;	1
but	1
in	1
proportion	1
to	1
his	1
credit,	1
his	1
opportunities	1
of	1
defrauding	1
increased;	1
and	1
these	1
became	1
temptations	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
firmness	1
to	1
resist.	1
His	1
old	1
manner	1
of	1
thinking	1
recurred.	1
"I	1
make	1
but	1
a	1
few	1
shillings	1
a	1
day,	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
but	1
slow	1
work,"	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
himself.	1
"What	1
signifies	1
my	1
good	1
character,	1
if	1
I	1
make	1
so	1
little	1
by	1
it?"	1
Light	1
gains,	1
and	1
frequent,	1
make	1
a	1
heavy	1
purse,	1
*	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
Francisco's	1
proverbs.	1
But	1
Piedro	1
was	1
in	1
too	1
great	1
haste	1
to	1
get	1
rich	1
to	1
take	1
time	1
into	1
his	1
account.	1
He	1
set	1
his	1
invention	1
to	1
work,	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
for	1
ingenuity,	1
to	1
devise	1
means	1
of	1
cheating	1
without	1
running	1
the	1
risk	1
of	1
detection.	1
He	1
observed	1
that	1
the	1
younger	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
community	1
were	1
extremely	1
fond	1
of	1
certain	1
coloured	1
sugar	1
plums,	1
and	1
of	1
burnt	1
almonds.	1
*	1
Poco	1
e	1
spesso	1
empie	1
il	1
l'orsetto.	1
With	1
the	1
money	1
he	1
had	1
earned	1
by	1
two	1
months'	1
trading	1
in	1
fruit	1
he	1
laid	1
in	1
a	1
large	1
stock	1
of	1
what	1
appeared	1
to	1
these	1
little	1
merchants	1
a	1
stock	1
of	1
almonds	1
and	1
sugar-plums,	1
and	1
he	1
painted	1
in	1
capital	1
gold	1
coloured	1
letters	1
upon	1
his	1
board,	1
"Sweetest,	1
largest,	1
most	1
admirable	1
sugar-plums	1
of	1
all	1
colours	1
ever	1
sold	1
in	1
Naples,	1
to	1
be	1
had	1
here;	1
and	1
in	1
gratitude	1
to	1
his	1
numerous	1
customers,	1
Piedro	1
adds	1
to	1
these,	1
'Burnt	1
almonds	1
gratis.'".	1
This	1
advertisement	1
attracted	1
the	1
attention	1
of	1
all	1
who	1
could	1
read;	1
and	1
many	1
who	1
could	1
not	1
read	1
heard	1
it	1
repeated	1
with	1
delight.	1
Crowds	1
of	1
children	1
surrounded	1
Piedro's	1
board	1
of	1
promise,	1
and	1
they	1
all	1
went	1
away	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
amply	1
satisfied.	1
Each	1
had	1
a	1
full	1
measure	1
of	1
coloured	1
sugar-	1
plums	1
at	1
the	1
usual	1
price,	1
and	1
along	1
with	1
these	1
a	1
burnt	1
almond	1
gratis.	1
The	1
burnt	1
almond	1
had	1
such	1
an	1
effect	1
upon	1
the	1
public	1
judgment,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
universally	1
allowed	1
that	1
the	1
sugar-plums	1
were,	1
as	1
the	1
advertisement	1
set	1
forth,	1
the	1
largest,	1
sweetest,	1
most	1
admirable	1
ever	1
sold	1
in	1
Naples;	1
though	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
they	1
were,	1
in	1
no	1
respect,	1
better	1
than	1
any	1
other	1
sugar-plums.	1
It	1
was	1
generally	1
reported	1
that	1
Piedro	1
gave	1
full	1
measure--fuller	1
than	1
any	1
other	1
board	1
in	1
the	1
city.	1
He	1
measured	1
the	1
sugar-plums	1
in	1
a	1
little	1
cubical	1
tin	1
box;	1
and	1
this,	1
it	1
was	1
affirmed,	1
he	1
heaped	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
top,	1
and	1
pressed	1
down	1
before	1
he	1
poured	1
out	1
the	1
contents	1
into	1
the	1
open	1
hands	1
of	1
his	1
approving	1
customers.	1
This	1
belief,	1
and	1
Piedro's	1
popularity,	1
continued	1
longer	1
even	1
than	1
he	1
had	1
expected;	1
and,	1
as	1
he	1
thought	1
his	1
sugar-plums	1
had	1
secured	1
their	1
reputation	1
with	1
the	1
GENEROUS	1
PUBLIC,	1
he	1
gradually	1
neglected	1
to	1
add	1
burnt	1
almonds	1
gratis.	1
One	1
day	1
a	1
boy	1
of	1
about	1
ten	1
years	1
old	1
passed	1
carelessly	1
by,	1
whistling	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
along,	1
and	1
swinging	1
a	1
carpenter's	1
rule	1
in	1
his	1
hand.	1
"Ha!	1
what	1
have	1
we	1
here?"	1
cried	1
he,	1
stopping	1
to	1
read	1
what	1
was	1
written	1
on	1
Piedro's	1
board.	1
"This	1
promises	1
rarely.	1
Old	1
as	1
I	1
am,	1
and	1
tall	1
of	1
my	1
age,	1
which	1
makes	1
the	1
matter	1
worse,	1
I	1
am	1
still	1
as	1
fond	1
of	1
sugar-plums	1
as	1
my	1
little	1
sister,	1
who	1
is	1
five	1
years	1
younger	1
than	1
I.	1
Come,	1
Signor,	1
fill	1
me	1
quick,	1
for	1
I'm	1
in	1
haste	1
to	1
taste	1
them,	1
two	1
measures	1
of	1
the	1
sweetest,	1
largest,	1
most	1
admirable	1
sugar-plums	1
in	1
Naples--one	1
measure	1
for	1
myself	1
and	1
one	1
for	1
my	1
little	1
Rosetta."	1
"You'll	1
pay	1
for	1
yourself	1
and	1
your	1
sister,	1
then,"	1
said	1
Piedro,	1
"for	1
no	1
credit	1
is	1
given	1
here."	1
"No	1
credit	1
do	1
I	1
ask,"	1
replied	1
the	1
lively	1
boy;	1
"when	1
I	1
told	1
you	1
I	1
loved	1
sugar-plums,	1
did	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
I	1
loved	1
them,	1
or	1
even	1
my	1
sister,	1
so	1
well	1
as	1
to	1
run	1
in	1
debt	1
for	1
them?	1
Here's	1
for	1
myself,	1
and	1
here's	1
for	1
my	1
sister's	1
share,"	1
said	1
he,	1
laying	1
down	1
his	1
money;	1
"and	1
now	1
for	1
the	1
burnt	1
almonds	1
gratis,	1
my	1
good	1
fellow."	1
"They	1
are	1
all	1
out;	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
out	1
of	1
burnt	1
almonds	1
this	1
great	1
while,"	1
said	1
Piedro.	1
"Then	1
why	1
are	1
they	1
in	1
your	1
advertisement	1
here?"	1
said	1
Carlo.	1
"I	1
have	1
not	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
scratch	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
board."	1
"What!	1
not	1
when	1
you	1
have,	1
by	1
your	1
own	1
account,	1
been	1
out	1
of	1
them	1
a	1
great	1
while?	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
it	1
required	1
so	1
much	1
time	1
to	1
blot	1
out	1
a	1
few	1
words--	1
let	1
us	1
try.";	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
spoke,	1
Carlo,	1
for	1
that	1
was	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Piedro's	1
new	1
customer,	1
pulled	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
white	1
chalk	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
pocket,	1
and	1
drew	1
a	1
broad	1
score	1
across	1
the	1
line	1
on	1
the	1
board	1
which	1
promised	1
burnt	1
almonds	1
gratis.	1
"You	1
are	1
most	1
impatient,"	1
said	1
Piedro;	1
"I	1
shall	1
have	1
a	1
fresh	1
stock	1
of	1
almonds	1
to-morrow."	1
"Why	1
must	1
the	1
board	1
tell	1
a	1
lie	1
to-day?"	1
"It	1
would	1
ruin	1
me	1
to	1
alter	1
it,"	1
said	1
Piedro.	1
"A	1
lie	1
may	1
ruin	1
you,	1
but	1
I	1
could	1
scarcely	1
think	1
the	1
truth	1
could."	1
"You	1
have	1
no	1
right	1
to	1
meddle	1
with	1
me	1
or	1
my	1
board,"	1
said	1
Piedro,	1
put	1
off	1
his	1
guard,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
usual	1
soft	1
voice	1
of	1
civility,	1
by	1
this	1
last	1
observation.	1
"My	1
character,	1
and	1
that	1
of	1
my	1
board,	1
are	1
too	1
firmly	1
established	1
now	1
for	1
any	1
chance	1
customer	1
like	1
you	1
to	1
injure."	1
"I	1
never	1
dreamed	1
of	1
injuring	1
you	1
or	1
anyone	1
else,"	1
said	1
Carlo--"I	1
wish,	1
moreover,	1
you	1
may	1
not	1
injure	1
yourself.	1
Do	1
as	1
you	1
please	1
with	1
your	1
board,	1
but	1
give	1
me	1
my	1
sugar-plums,	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
some	1
right	1
to	1
meddle	1
with	1
those,	1
having	1
paid	1
for	1
them."	1
"Hold	1
out	1
your	1
hand,	1
then."	1
"No,	1
put	1
them	1
in	1
here,	1
if	1
you	1
please;	1
put	1
my	1
sister's,	1
at	1
least,	1
in	1
here;	1
she	1
likes	1
to	1
have	1
them	1
in	1
this	1
box:	1
I	1
bought	1
some	1
for	1
her	1
in	1
it	1
yesterday,	1
and	1
she'll	1
think	1
they'll	1
taste	1
the	1
better	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
box.	1
But	1
how	1
is	1
this?	1
your	1
measure	1
does	1
not	1
fill	1
my	1
box	1
nearly;	1
you	1
give	1
us	1
very	1
few	1
sugar-plums	1
for	1
our	1
money."	1
"I	1
give	1
you	1
full	1
measure,	1
as	1
I	1
give	1
to	1
everybody."	1
"The	1
measure	1
should	1
be	1
an	1
inch	1
cube,	1
I	1
know,"	1
said	1
Carlo;	1
"that's	1
what	1
all	1
the	1
little	1
merchants	1
have	1
agreed	1
to,	1
you	1
know."	1
"True,"	1
said	1
Piedro,	1
"so	1
it	1
is."	1
"And	1
so	1
it	1
is,	1
I	1
must	1
allow,"	1
said	1
Carlo,	1
measuring	1
the	1
outside	1
of	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
carpenter's	1
rule	1
which	1
he	1
held	1
in	1
his	1
hand.	1
"An	1
inch	1
every	1
way;	1
and	1
yet	1
by	1
my	1
eye--and	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
bad	1
one,	1
being	1
used	1
to	1
measuring	1
carpenter's	1
work	1
for	1
my	1
father--by	1
my	1
eye	1
I	1
should	1
think	1
this	1
would	1
have	1
held	1
more	1
sugar-plums."	1
"The	1
eye	1
often	1
deceives	1
us;"	1
said	1
Piedro.	1
"There's	1
nothing	1
like	1
measuring,	1
you	1
find."	1
"There's	1
nothing	1
like	1
measuring,	1
I	1
find,	1
indeed,"	1
replied	1
Carlo,	1
as	1
he	1
looked	1
closely	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
his	1
rule,	1
which,	1
since	1
he	1
spoke	1
last,	1
he	1
had	1
put	1
into	1
the	1
cube	1
to	1
take	1
its	1
depth	1
in	1
the	1
inside.	1
"This	1
is	1
not	1
as	1
deep	1
by	1
a	1
quarter	1
of	1
an	1
inch,	1
Signor	1
Piedro,	1
measured	1
within	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
measured	1
without."	1
Piedro	1
changed	1
colour	1
terribly,	1
and	1
seizing	1
hold	1
of	1
the	1
tin	1
box,	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
wrest	1
it	1
from	1
the	1
youth	1
who	1
measured	1
so	1
accurately.	1
Carlo	1
held	1
his	1
prize	1
fast,	1
and	1
lifting	1
it	1
above	1
his	1
head,	1
he	1
ran	1
into	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
square	1
where	1
the	1
little	1
market	1
was	1
held,	1
exclaiming,	1
"A	1
discovery!	1
a	1
discovery!	1
that	1
concerns	1
all	1
who	1
love	1
sugar-plums.	1
A	1
discovery!	1
a	1
discovery	1
that	1
concerns	1
all	1
who	1
have	1
ever	1
bought	1
the	1
sweetest,	1
and	1
most	1
admirable	1
sugar-plums	1
ever	1
sold	1
in	1
Naples."	1
The	1
crowd	1
gathered	1
from	1
all	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
square	1
as	1
he	1
spoke.	1
"We	1
have	1
bought,"	1
and	1
"We	1
have	1
bought	1
of	1
those	1
sugar-plums,"	1
cried	1
several	1
little	1
voices	1
at	1
once,	1
"if	1
you	1
mean	1
Piedro's."	1
"The	1
same,"	1
continued	1
Carlo--"he	1
who,	1
out	1
of	1
gratitude	1
to	1
his	1
numerous	1
customers,	1
gives,	1
or	1
promises	1
to	1
give,	1
burnt	1
almonds	1
gratis."	1
"Excellent	1
they	1
were!"	1
cried	1
several	1
voices.	1
"We	1
all	1
know	1
Piedro	1
well;	1
but	1
what's	1
your	1
discovery?"	1
"My	1
discovery	1
is,"	1
said	1
Carlo,	1
"that	1
you,	1
none	1
of	1
you,	1
know	1
Piedro.	1
Look	1
you	1
here;	1
look	1
at	1
this	1
box--this	1
is	1
his	1
measure;	1
it	1
has	1
a	1
false	1
bottom--	1
it	1
holds	1
only	1
three-quarters	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
it	1
ought	1
to	1
do;	1
and	1
his	1
numerous	1
customers	1
have	1
all	1
been	1
cheated	1
of	1
one-quarter	1
of	1
every	1
measure	1
of	1
the	1
admirable	1
sugar-plums	1
they	1
have	1
bought	1
from	1
him.	1
'Think	1
twice	1
of	1
a	1
good	1
bargain,'	1
says	1
the	1
proverb."	1
"So	1
we	1
have	1
been	1
finely	1
duped,	1
indeed,"	1
cried	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
bystanders,	1
looking	1
at	1
one	1
another	1
with	1
a	1
mortified	1
air.	1
"Full	1
of	1
courtesy,	1
full	1
of	1
craft!"	1
*	1
"So	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
his	1
burnt	1
almonds	1
gratis,"	1
cried	1
others;	1
all	1
joined	1
in	1
an	1
uproar	1
of	1
indignation,	1
except	1
one,	1
who,	1
as	1
he	1
stood	1
behind	1
the	1
rest,	1
expressed	1
in	1
his	1
countenance	1
silent	1
surprise	1
and	1
sorrow.	1
*	1
Chi	1

O	1

"Is	1
this	1
Piedro	1
a	1
relation	1
of	1
yours?"	1
said	1
Carlo,	1
going	1
up	1
to	1
this	1
silent	1
person.	1
"I	1
am	1
sorry,	1
if	1
he	1
be,	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
published	1
his	1
disgrace,	1
for	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
hurt	1
YOU.	1
You	1
don't	1
sell	1
sugar-plums	1
as	1
he	1
does,	1
I'm	1
sure;	1
for	1
my	1
little	1
sister	1
Rosetta	1
has	1
often	1
bought	1
from	1
you.	1
Can	1
this	1
Piedro	1
be	1
a	1
friend	1
of	1
yours?"	1
"I	1
wished	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
his	1
friend;	1
but	1
I	1
see	1
I	1
can't,"	1
said	1
Francisco.	1
"He	1
is	1
a	1
neighbour	1
of	1
ours,	1
and	1
I	1
pitied	1
him;	1
but	1
since	1
he	1
is	1
at	1
his	1
old	1
tricks	1
again,	1
there's	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
matter.	1
I	1
have	1
reason	1
to	1
be	1
obliged	1
to	1
you,	1
for	1
I	1
was	1
nearly	1
taken	1
in.	1
He	1
has	1
behaved	1
so	1
well	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
past,	1
that	1
I	1
intended	1
this	1
very	1
evening	1
to	1
have	1
gone	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
to	1
have	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
willing	1
to	1
do	1
for	1
him	1
what	1
he	1
has	1
long	1
begged	1
of	1
me	1
to	1
do--to	1
enter	1
into	1
partnership	1
with	1
him."	1
"Francisco!	1
Francisco!--your	1
measure,	1
lend	1
us	1
your	1
measure!"	1
exclaimed	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
little	1
merchants	1
crowding	1
round	1
him.	1
"You	1
have	1
a	1
measure	1
for	1
sugar-plums;	1
and	1
we	1
have	1
all	1
agreed	1
to	1
refer	1
to	1
that,	1
and	1
to	1
see	1
how	1
much	1
we	1
have	1
been	1
cheated	1
before	1
we	1
go	1
to	1
break	1
Piedro's	1
bench	1
and	1
declare	1
him	1
bankrupt,	1
*--the	1
punishment	1
for	1
all	1
knaves."	1
*	1
This	1
word	1
comes	1
from	1
two	1
Italian	1
words,	1
bunco	1
rotto--broken	1
bench.	1
Bankers	1
and	1
merchants	1
used	1
formerly	1
to	1
count	1
their	1
money,	1
and	1
write	1
their	1
bills	1
of	1
exchange	1
upon	1
benches	1
in	1
the	1
streets;	1
and	1
when	1
a	1
merchant	1
or	1
banker	1
lost	1
his	1
credit,	1
and	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
pay	1
his	1
debts,	1
his	1
bench	1
was	1
broken.	1
They	1
pressed	1
on	1
to	1
Francisco's	1
board,	1
obtained	1
his	1
measure,	1
found	1
that	1
it	1
held	1
something	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
quarter	1
above	1
the	1
quantity	1
that	1
could	1
be	1
contained	1
in	1
Piedro's.	1
The	1
cries	1
of	1
the	1
enraged	1
populace	1
were	1
now	1
most	1
clamorous.	1
They	1
hung	1
the	1
just	1
and	1
the	1
unjust	1
measures	1
upon	1
high	1
poles;	1
and,	1
forming	1
themselves	1
into	1
a	1
formidable	1
phalanx,	1
they	1
proceeded	1
towards	1
Piedro's	1
well	1
known	1
yellow	1
lettered	1
board,	1
exclaiming,	1
as	1
they	1
went	1
along,	1
"Common	1
cause!	1
common	1
cause!	1
The	1
little	1
Neapolitan	1
merchants	1
will	1
have	1
no	1
knaves	1
amongst	1
them!	1
Break	1
his	1
bench!	1
break	1
his	1
bench!	1
He	1
is	1
a	1
bankrupt	1
in	1
honesty."	1
Piedro	1
saw	1
the	1
mob,	1
heard	1
the	1
indignant	1
clamour,	1
and,	1
terrified	1
at	1
the	1
approach	1
of	1
numbers,	1
he	1
fled	1
with	1
the	1
utmost	1
precipitation,	1
having	1
scarcely	1
time	1
to	1
pack	1
up	1
half	1
his	1
sugar-plums.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
prodigious	1
number,	1
more	1
than	1
would	1
have	1
filled	1
many	1
honest	1
measures,	1
scattered	1
upon	1
the	1
ground	1
and	1
trampled	1
under	1
foot	1
by	1
the	1
crowd.	1
Piedro's	1
bench	1
was	1
broken,	1
and	1
the	1
public	1
vengeance	1
wreaked	1
itself	1
also	1
upon	1
his	1
treacherous	1
painted	1
board.	1
It	1
was,	1
after	1
being	1
much	1
disfigured	1
by	1
various	1
inscriptions	1
expressive	1
of	1
the	1
universal	1
contempt	1
for	1
Piedro,	1
hung	1
up	1
in	1
a	1
conspicuous	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
market-place;	1
and	1
the	1
false	1
measure	1
was	1
fastened	1
like	1
a	1
cap	1
upon	1
one	1
of	1
its	1
corners.	1
Piedro	1
could	1
never	1
more	1
show	1
his	1
face	1
in	1
this	1
market,	1
and	1
all	1
hopes	1
of	1
friendship--all	1
hopes	1
of	1
partnership	1
with	1
Francisco--were	1
for	1
ever	1
at	1
an	1
end.	1
If	1
rogues	1
would	1
calculate,	1
they	1
would	1
cease	1
to	1
be	1
rogues;	1
for	1
they	1
would	1
certainly	1
discover	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
most	1
for	1
their	1
interest	1
to	1
be	1
honest--	1
setting	1
aside	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
being	1
esteemed	1
and	1
beloved,	1
of	1
having	1
a	1
safe	1
conscience,	1
with	1
perfect	1
freedom	1
from	1
all	1
the	1
various	1
embarrassments	1
and	1
terror	1
to	1
which	1
knaves	1
are	1
subject.	1
Is	1
it	1
not	1
clear	1
that	1
our	1
crafty	1
hero	1
would	1
have	1
gained	1
rather	1
more	1
by	1
a	1
partnership	1
with	1
Francisco,	1
and	1
by	1
a	1
fair	1
character,	1
than	1
he	1
could	1
possibly	1
obtain	1
by	1
fraudulent	1
dealing	1
in	1
comfits?	1
When	1
the	1
mob	1
had	1
dispersed,	1
after	1
satisfying	1
themselves	1
with	1
executing	1
summary	1
justice	1
upon	1
Piedro's	1
bench	1
and	1
board,	1
Francisco	1
found	1
a	1
carpenter's	1
rule	1
lying	1
upon	1
the	1
ground	1
near	1
Piedro's	1
broken	1
bench,	1
which	1
he	1
recollected	1
to	1
have	1
seen	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
Carlo.	1
He	1
examined	1
it	1
carefully,	1
and	1
he	1
found	1
Carlo's	1
name	1
written	1
upon	1
it,	1
and	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
street	1
where	1
he	1
lived;	1
and	1
though	1
it	1
was	1
considerably	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
way,	1
he	1
set	1
out	1
immediately	1
to	1
restore	1
the	1
rule,	1
which	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
handsome	1
one,	1
to	1
its	1
rightful	1
owner.	1
After	1
a	1
hot	1
walk	1
through	1
several	1
streets,	1
he	1
overtook	1
Carlo,	1
who	1
had	1
just	1
reached	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
house.	1
Carlo	1
was	1
particularly	1
obliged	1
to	1
him,	1
he	1
said,	1
for	1
restoring	1
this	1
rule	1
to	1
him,	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
present	1
from	1
the	1
master	1
of	1
a	1
vessel,	1
who	1
employed	1
his	1
father	1
to	1
do	1
carpenter's	1
work	1
for	1
him.	1
"One	1
should	1
not	1
praise	1
one's	1
self,	1
they	1
say,"	1
continued	1
Carlo,	1
"but	1
I	1
long	1
so	1
much	1
to	1
gain	1
your	1
good	1
opinion,	1
that	1
I	1
must	1
tell	1
you	1
the	1
whole	1
history	1
of	1
the	1
rule	1
you	1
have	1
restored.	1
It	1
was	1
given	1
to	1
me	1
for	1
having	1
measured	1
the	1
work	1
and	1
made	1
up	1
the	1
bill	1
of	1
a	1
whole	1
pleasure-boat	1
myself.	1
You	1
may	1
guess	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
sorry	1
enough	1
to	1
have	1
lost	1
it.	1
Thank	1
you	1
for	1
its	1
being	1
once	1
more	1
in	1
my	1
careless	1
hands,	1
and	1
tell	1
me,	1
I	1
beg,	1
whenever	1
I	1
can	1
do	1
you	1
any	1
service.	1
By-the-by,	1
I	1
can	1
make	1
up	1
for	1
you	1
a	1
fruit	1
stall.	1
I'll	1
do	1
it	1
to-morrow,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
admiration	1
of	1
the	1
market.	1
Is	1
there	1
anything	1
else	1
you	1
could	1
think	1
of	1
for	1
me?"	1
"Why,	1
yes,"	1
said	1
Francisco;	1
"since	1
you	1
are	1
so	1
good-natured,	1
perhaps	1
you'd	1
be	1
kind	1
enough	1
to	1
tell	1
me	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
some	1
of	1
those	1
lines	1
and	1
figures	1
that	1
I	1
see	1
upon	1
your	1
rule.	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
great	1
curiosity	1
to	1
know	1
their	1
use."	1
"That	1
I'll	1
explain	1
to	1
you	1
with	1
pleasure,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
I	1
know	1
them	1
myself;	1
but	1
when	1
I'm	1
at	1
fault,	1
my	1
father,	1
who	1
is	1
cleverer	1
than	1
I	1
am,	1
and	1
understands	1
trigonometry,	1
can	1
help	1
us	1
out."	1
"Trigonometry!"	1
repeated	1
Francisco,	1
not	1
a	1
little	1
alarmed	1
at	1
the	1
high	1
sounding	1
word;	1
"that's	1
what	1
I	1
certainly	1
shall	1
never	1
understand."	1
"Oh,	1
never	1
fear,"	1
replied	1
Carlo,	1
laughing.	1
"I	1
looked	1
just	1
as	1
you	1
do	1
now-	1
-I	1
felt	1
just	1
as	1
you	1
do	1
now--all	1
in	1
a	1
fright	1
and	1
a	1
puzzle,	1
when	1
I	1
first	1
heard	1
of	1
angles	1
and	1
sines,	1
and	1
cosines,	1
and	1
arcs	1
and	1
centres,	1
and	1
complements	1
and	1
tangents."	1
"Oh	1
mercy!	1
mercy!"	1
interrupted	1
Francisco,	1
whilst	1
Carlo	1
laughed,	1
with	1
a	1
benevolent	1
sense	1
of	1
superiority.	1
"Why,"	1
said	1
Carlo,	1
"you'll	1
find	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
are	1
nothing	1
when	1
you	1
are	1
used	1
to	1
them.	1
But	1
I	1
cannot	1
explain	1
my	1
rule	1
to	1
you	1
here	1
broiling	1
in	1
the	1
sun.	1
Besides,	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
a	1
day,	1
I	1
promise	1
you;	1
but	1
come	1
and	1
see	1
us	1
at	1
your	1
leisure	1
hours,	1
and	1
we'll	1
study	1
it	1
together.	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
great	1
notion	1
we	1
shall	1
become	1
friends;	1
and,	1
to	1
begin,	1
step	1
in	1
with	1
me	1
now,"	1
said	1
Carlo,	1
"and	1
eat	1
a	1
little	1
macaroni	1
with	1
us.	1
I	1
know	1
it	1
is	1
ready	1
by	1
this	1
time.	1
Besides,	1
you'll	1
see	1
my	1
father,	1
and	1
he'll	1
show	1
you	1
plenty	1
of	1
rules	1
and	1
compasses,	1
as	1
you	1
like	1
such	1
things;	1
and	1
then	1
I'll	1
go	1
home	1
with	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
cool	1
of	1
the	1
evening,	1
and	1
you	1
shall	1
show	1
me	1
your	1
melons	1
and	1
vines,	1
and	1
teach	1
me,	1
in	1
time,	1
something	1
of	1
gardening.	1
Oh,	1
I	1
see	1
we	1
must	1
be	1
good	1
friends,	1
just	1
made	1
for	1
each	1
other;	1
so	1
come	1
in--no	1
ceremony."	1
Carlo	1
was	1
not	1
mistaken	1
in	1
his	1
predictions;	1
he	1
and	1
Francisco	1
became	1
very	1
good	1
friends,	1
spent	1
all	1
their	1
leisure	1
hours	1
together,	1
either	1
in	1
Carlo's	1
workshop	1
or	1
in	1
Francisco's	1
vineyard,	1
and	1
they	1
mutually	1
improved	1
each	1
other.	1
Francisco,	1
before	1
he	1
saw	1
his	1
friend's	1
rule,	1
knew	1
but	1
just	1
enough	1
of	1
arithmetic	1
to	1
calculate	1
in	1
his	1
head	1
the	1
price	1
of	1
the	1
fruit	1
which	1
he	1
sold	1
in	1
the	1
market;	1
but	1
with	1
Carlo's	1
assistance,	1
and	1
the	1
ambition	1
to	1
understand	1
the	1
tables	1
and	1
figures	1
upon	1
the	1
wonderful	1
rule,	1
he	1
set	1
to	1
work	1
in	1
earnest,	1
and	1
in	1
due	1
time,	1
satisfied	1
both	1
himself	1
and	1
his	1
master.	1
"Who	1
knows	1
but	1
these	1
things	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
learning	1
now	1
may	1
be	1
of	1
some	1
use	1
to	1
me	1
before	1
I	1
die?"	1
said	1
Francisco,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
sitting	1
one	1
morning	1
with	1
his	1
tutor,	1
the	1
carpenter.	1
"To	1
be	1
sure	1
it	1
will,"	1
said	1
the	1
carpenter,	1
putting	1
down	1
his	1
compasses,	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
drawing	1
a	1
circle--"Arithmetic	1
is	1
a	1
most	1
useful,	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
say	1
necessary	1
thing	1
to	1
be	1
known	1
by	1
men	1
in	1
all	1
stations;	1
and	1
a	1
little	1
trigonometry	1
does	1
no	1
harm.	1
In	1
short,	1
my	1
maxim	1
is,	1
that	1
no	1
knowledge	1
comes	1
amiss;	1
for	1
a	1
man's	1
head	1
is	1
of	1
as	1
much	1
use	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
his	1
hands;	1
and	1
even	1
more	1
so.	1
"A	1
word	1
to	1
the	1
wise	1
will	1
always	1
suffice."	1
"Besides,	1
to	1
say	1
nothing	1
of	1
making	1
a	1
fortune,	1
is	1
not	1
there	1
a	1
great	1
pleasure	1
in	1
being	1
something	1
of	1
a	1
scholar,	1
and	1
being	1
able	1
to	1
pass	1
one's	1
time	1
with	1
one's	1
book,	1
and	1
one's	1
compasses	1
and	1
pencil?	1
Safe	1
companions	1
these	1
for	1
young	1
and	1
old.	1
No	1
one	1
gets	1
into	1
mischief	1
that	1
has	1
pleasant	1
things	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
and	1
to	1
do	1
when	1
alone;	1
and	1
I	1
know,	1
for	1
my	1
part,	1
that	1
trigonometry	1
is--"	1
Here	1
the	1
carpenter,	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
pronounce	1
a	1
fresh	1
panegyric	1
upon	1
his	1
favourite	1
trigonometry,	1
was	1
interrupted	1
by	1
the	1
sudden	1
entrance	1
of	1
his	1
little	1
daughter	1
Rosetta,	1
all	1
in	1
tears:	1
a	1
very	1
unusual	1
spectacle,	1
for,	1
taking	1
the	1
year	1
round,	1
she	1
shed	1
fewer	1
tears	1
than	1
any	1
child	1
of	1
her	1
age	1
in	1
Naples.	1
"Why,	1
my	1
dear	1
good	1
humoured	1
little	1
Rosetta,	1
what	1
has	1
happened?	1
Why	1
these	1
large	1
tears?"	1
said	1
her	1
brother	1
Carlo,	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
her,	1
and	1
wiped	1
them	1
from	1
her	1
cheeks.	1
"And	1
these	1
that	1
are	1
going	1
over	1
the	1
bridge	1
of	1
the	1
nose	1
so	1
fast?	1
I	1
must	1
stop	1
these	1
tears,	1
too,"	1
said	1
Carlo.	1
Rosetta,	1
at	1
this	1
speech,	1
burst	1
out	1
laughing,	1
and	1
said	1
that	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
till	1
then	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
any	1
bridge	1
on	1
her	1
nose.	1
"And	1
were	1
these	1
shells	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
tears?"	1
said	1
her	1
brother,	1
looking	1
at	1
a	1
heap	1
of	1
shells,	1
which	1
she	1
held	1
before	1
her	1
in	1
her	1
frock.	1
"Yes,	1
partly,"	1
said	1
Rosetta.	1
"It	1
was	1
partly	1
my	1
own	1
fault,	1
but	1
not	1
all.	1
You	1
know	1
I	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
carpenter's	1
yard,	1
near	1
the	1
arsenal,	1
where	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
are	1
picking	1
up	1
chips	1
and	1
sticks	1
so	1
busily;	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
as	1
busy	1
as	1
any	1
of	1
them,	1
because	1
I	1
wanted	1
to	1
fill	1
my	1
basket	1
soon;	1
and	1
then	1
I	1
thought	1
I	1
should	1
sell	1
my	1
basketful	1
directly	1
in	1
the	1
little	1
wood-market.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
I	1
had	1
filled	1
my	1
basket,	1
and	1
made	1
up	1
my	1
faggot	1
(which	1
was	1
not	1
done,	1
brother,	1
till	1
I	1
was	1
almost	1
baked	1
by	1
the	1
sun,	1
for	1
I	1
was	1
forced	1
to	1
wait	1
by	1
the	1
carpenters	1
for	1
the	1
bits	1
of	1
wood	1
to	1
make	1
up	1
my	1
faggot)--I	1
say,	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
ready,	1
and	1
my	1
basket	1
full,	1
I	1
left	1
it	1
altogether	1
in	1
the	1
yard."	1
"That	1
was	1
not	1
wise	1
to	1
leave	1
it,"	1
said	1
Carlo.	1
"But	1
I	1
only	1
left	1
it	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
minutes,	1
brother,	1
and	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
think	1
anybody	1
would	1
be	1
so	1
dishonest	1
as	1
to	1
take	1
it	1
whilst	1
I	1
was	1
away.	1
I	1
only	1
just	1
ran	1
to	1
tell	1
a	1
boy,	1
who	1
had	1
picked	1
up	1
all	1
these	1
beautiful	1
shells	1
upon	1
the	1
sea-shore,	1
and	1
who	1
wanted	1
to	1
sell	1
them,	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
glad	1
to	1
buy	1
them	1
from	1
him,	1
if	1
he	1
would	1
only	1
be	1
so	1
good	1
as	1
to	1
keep	1
them	1
for	1
me,	1
for	1
an	1
hour	1
or	1
so,	1
till	1
I	1
had	1
carried	1
my	1
wood	1
to	1
market,	1
and	1
till	1
I	1
had	1
sold	1
it,	1
and	1
so	1
had	1
money	1
to	1
pay	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
shells."	1
"Your	1
heart	1
was	1
set	1
mightily	1
on	1
these	1
shells,	1
Rosetta."	1
"Yes;	1
for	1
I	1
thought	1
you	1
and	1
Francisco,	1
brother,	1
would	1
like	1
to	1
have	1
them	1
for	1
your	1
nice	1
grotto	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
making	1
at	1
Resina.	1
That	1
was	1
the	1
reason	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
hurry	1
to	1
get	1
them.	1
The	1
boy	1
who	1
had	1
them	1
to	1
sell	1
was	1
very	1
good-natured;	1
he	1
poured	1
them	1
into	1
my	1
lap,	1
and	1
said	1
I	1
had	1
such	1
an	1
honest	1
face	1
he	1
would	1
trust	1
me,	1
and	1
that	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
hurry,	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
wait	1
an	1
hour	1
whilst	1
I	1
sold	1
my	1
wood;	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
sure	1
I	1
would	1
pay	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
evening,	1
and	1
he	1
told	1
me	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
call	1
here	1
this	1
evening	1
for	1
the	1
money.	1
But	1
now	1
what	1
shall	1
I	1
do,	1
Carlo?	1
I	1
shall	1
have	1
no	1
money	1
to	1
give	1
him:	1
I	1
must	1
give	1
back	1
his	1
shells,	1
and	1
that's	1
a	1
great	1
pity."	1
"But	1
how	1
happened	1
it	1
that	1
you	1
did	1
not	1
sell	1
your	1
wood?"	1
"Oh,	1
I	1
forgot;	1
did	1
not	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
that?	1
When	1
I	1
went	1
for	1
my	1
basket,	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
it	1
was	1
empty,	1
quite	1
empty,	1
not	1
a	1
chip	1
left?	1
Some	1
dishonest	1
person	1
had	1
carried	1
it	1
all	1
off.	1
Had	1
not	1
I	1
reason	1
to	1
cry	1
now,	1
Carlo?'	1
"I'll	1
go	1
this	1
minute	1
into	1
the	1
wood-market,	1
and	1
see	1
if	1
I	1
can	1
find	1
your	1
faggot.	1
Won't	1
that	1
be	1
better	1
than	1
crying?"	1
said	1
her	1
brother.	1
"Should	1
you	1
know	1
any	1
one	1
of	1
your	1
pieces	1
of	1
wood	1
again	1
if	1
you	1
were	1
to	1
see	1
them?"	1
"Yes,	1
one	1
of	1
them,	1
I	1
am	1
sure,	1
I	1
should	1
know	1
again,"	1
said	1
Rosetta.	1
"It	1
had	1
a	1
notch	1
at	1
one	1
end	1
of	1
it,	1
where	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
carpenters	1
cut	1
it	1
off	1
from	1
another	1
piece	1
of	1
wood	1
for	1
me."	1
"And	1
is	1
this	1
piece	1
of	1
wood	1
from	1
which	1
the	1
carpenter	1
cut	1
it	1
still	1
to	1
be	1
seen?"	1
said	1
Francisco.	1
"Yes,	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
yard;	1
but	1
I	1
cannot	1
bring	1
it	1
to	1
you,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
heavy."	1
"We	1
can	1
go	1
to	1
it,"	1
said	1
Francisco,	1
"and	1
I	1
hope	1
we	1
shall	1
recover	1
your	1
basketful."	1
Carlo	1
and	1
his	1
friend	1
went	1
with	1
Rosetta	1
immediately	1
to	1
the	1
yard,	1
near	1
the	1
arsenal,	1
saw	1
the	1
notched	1
piece	1
of	1
wood,	1
and	1
then	1
proceeded	1
to	1
the	1
little	1
wood-market,	1
and	1
searched	1
every	1
heap	1
that	1
lay	1
before	1
the	1
little	1
factors;	1
but	1
no	1
notched	1
bit	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
found,	1
and	1
Rosetta	1
declared	1
that	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
one	1
stick	1
that	1
looked	1
at	1
all	1
like	1
any	1
of	1
hers.	1
On	1
their	1
part,	1
her	1
companions	1
eagerly	1
untied	1
their	1
faggots	1
to	1
show	1
them	1
to	1
her,	1
and	1
exclaimed,	1
"That	1
they	1
were	1
incapable	1
of	1
taking	1
what	1
did	1
not	1
belong	1
to	1
them;	1
that	1
of	1
all	1
persons	1
they	1
should	1
never	1
have	1
thought	1
of	1
taking	1
anything	1
from	1
the	1
good	1
natured	1
little	1
Rosetta,	1
who	1
was	1
always	1
ready	1
to	1
give	1
to	1
others,	1
and	1
to	1
help	1
them	1
in	1
making	1
up	1
their	1
loads."	1
Despairing	1
of	1
discovering	1
the	1
thief,	1
Francisco	1
and	1
Carlo	1
left	1
the	1
market.	1
As	1
they	1
were	1
returning	1
home,	1
they	1
were	1
met	1
by	1
the	1
English	1
servant	1
Arthur,	1
who	1
asked	1
Francisco	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
been,	1
and	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
going.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
heard	1
of	1
Rosetta's	1
lost	1
faggot,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
bit	1
of	1
wood,	1
notched	1
at	1
one	1
end,	1
of	1
which	1
Rosetta	1
drew	1
the	1
shape	1
with	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
chalk,	1
which	1
her	1
brother	1
had	1
lent	1
her,	1
Arthur	1
exclaimed,	1
"I	1
have	1
seen	1
such	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
wood	1
as	1
this	1
within	1
this	1
quarter	1
of	1
an	1
hour;	1
but	1
I	1
cannot	1
recollect	1
where.	1
Stay!	1
this	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
baker's,	1
I	1
think,	1
where	1
I	1
went	1
for	1
some	1
rolls	1
for	1
my	1
master.	1
It	1
was	1
lying	1
beside	1
his	1
oven."	1
To	1
the	1
baker's	1
they	1
all	1
went	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
possible,	1
and	1
they	1
got	1
there	1
but	1
just	1
in	1
time.	1
The	1
baker	1
had	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
the	1
bit	1
of	1
wood	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
that	1
instant	1
going	1
to	1
feed	1
his	1
oven.	1
"Stop,	1
good	1
Mr.	1
Baker!"	1
cried	1
Rosetta,	1
who	1
ran	1
into	1
the	1
baker's	1
shop	1
first;	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
heard	1
"Stop!	1
stop!"	1
re-echoed	1
by	1
many	1
voices,	1
the	1
baker	1
stopped;	1
and	1
turning	1
to	1
Francisco,	1
Carlo	1
and	1
Arthur,	1
begged,	1
with	1
a	1
countenance	1
of	1
some	1
surprise,	1
to	1
know	1
why	1
they	1
had	1
desired	1
him	1
to	1
stop.	1
The	1
case	1
was	1
easily	1
explained,	1
and	1
the	1
baker	1
told	1
them	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
buy	1
any	1
wood	1
in	1
the	1
little	1
market	1
that	1
morning;	1
that	1
this	1
faggot	1
he	1
had	1
purchased	1
between	1
the	1
hours	1
of	1
twelve	1
and	1
one	1
from	1
a	1
lad	1
about	1
Francisco's	1
height,	1
whom	1
he	1
met	1
near	1
the	1
yard	1
of	1
the	1
arsenal.	1
"This	1
is	1
my	1
bit	1
of	1
wood,	1
I	1
am	1
sure;	1
I	1
know	1
it	1
by	1
this	1
notch,"	1
said	1
Rosetta.	1
"Well,"	1
said	1
the	1
baker,	1
"if	1
you	1
will	1
stay	1
here	1
a	1
few	1
minutes,	1
you	1
will	1
probably	1
see	1
the	1
lad	1
who	1
sold	1
it	1
to	1
me.	1
He	1
desired	1
to	1
be	1
paid	1
in	1
bread,	1
and	1
my	1
bread	1
was	1
not	1
quite	1
baked	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
here.	1
I	1
bid	1
him	1
call	1
again	1
in	1
an	1
hour,	1
and	1
I	1
fancy	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
pretty	1
punctual,	1
for	1
he	1
looked	1
desperately	1
hungry."	1
The	1
baker	1
had	1
scarcely	1
finished	1
speaking	1
when	1
Francisco,	1
who	1
was	1
standing	1
watching	1
at	1
the	1
door,	1
exclaimed,	1
"Here	1
comes	1
Piedro!	1
I	1
hope	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
boy	1
who	1
sold	1
you	1
the	1
wood,	1
Mr.	1
Baker?"	1
"He	1
is	1
the	1
boy,	1
though,"	1
replied	1
the	1
baker,	1
and	1
Piedro,	1
who	1
now	1
entered	1
the	1
shop,	1
started	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
Carlo	1
and	1
Francisco,	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
since	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
disgrace	1
in	1
the	1
fruit-market.	1
"Your	1
servant,	1
Signor	1
Piedro,"	1
said	1
Carlo;	1
"I	1
have	1
the	1
honour	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
this	1
piece	1
of	1
wood,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
you	1
took	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
basket,	1
which	1
you	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
yard	1
of	1
the	1
arsenal,	1
belongs	1
to	1
my	1
sister."	1
"Yes,	1
indeed,"	1
cried	1
Rosetta.	1
Piedro	1
being	1
very	1
certain	1
that	1
nobody	1
saw	1
him	1
when	1
he	1
emptied	1
Rosetta's	1
basket,	1
and	1
imagining	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
suspected	1
only	1
upon	1
the	1
bare	1
assertion	1
of	1
a	1
child	1
like	1
Rosetta,	1
who	1
might	1
be	1
baffled	1
and	1
frightened	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
story,	1
boldly	1
denied	1
the	1
charge,	1
and	1
defied	1
any	1
one	1
to	1
prove	1
him	1
guilty.	1
"He	1
has	1
a	1
right	1
to	1
be	1
heard	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
defence,"	1
said	1
Arthur,	1
with	1
the	1
cool	1
justice	1
of	1
an	1
Englishman;	1
and	1
he	1
stopped	1
the	1
angry	1
Carlo's	1
arm,	1
who	1
was	1
going	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
culprit	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
Italian	1
vehemence	1
of	1
oratory	1
and	1
gesture.	1
Arthur	1
went	1
on	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
in	1
bad	1
Italian	1
about	1
the	1
excellence	1
of	1
an	1
English	1
trial	1
by	1
jury,	1
which	1
Carlo	1
was	1
too	1
much	1
enraged	1
to	1
hear,	1
but	1
to	1
which	1
Francisco	1
paid	1
attention,	1
and	1
turning	1
to	1
Piedro,	1
he	1
asked	1
him	1
if	1
he	1
was	1
willing	1
to	1
be	1
judged	1
by	1
twelve	1
of	1
his	1
equals?	1
"With	1
all	1
my	1
heart,"	1
said	1
Piedro,	1
still	1
maintaining	1
an	1
unmoved	1
countenance,	1
and	1
they	1
returned	1
immediately	1
to	1
the	1
little	1
wood-market.	1
On	1
their	1
way,	1
they	1
had	1
passed	1
through	1
the	1
fruit-market,	1
and	1
crowds	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
well	1
acquainted	1
with	1
Piedro's	1
former	1
transactions	1
followed,	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
event	1
of	1
the	1
present	1
trial.	1
Arthur	1
could	1
not,	1
especially	1
as	1
he	1
spoke	1
wretched	1
Italian,	1
make	1
the	1
eager	1
little	1
merchants	1
understand	1
the	1
nature	1
and	1
advantages	1
of	1
an	1
English	1
trial	1
by	1
jury.	1
They	1
preferred	1
their	1
own	1
summary	1
mode	1
of	1
proceeding.	1
Francisco,	1
in	1
whose	1
integrity	1
they	1
all	1
had	1
perfect	1
confidence,	1
was	1
chosen	1
with	1
unanimous	1
shouts	1
for	1
the	1
judge;	1
but	1
he	1
declined	1
the	1
office,	1
and	1
another	1
was	1
appointed.	1
He	1
was	1
raised	1
upon	1
a	1
bench,	1
and	1
the	1
guilty	1
but	1
insolent	1
looking	1
Piedro,	1
and	1
the	1
ingenuous,	1
modest	1
Rosetta	1
stood	1
before	1
him.	1
She	1
made	1
her	1
complaint	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
artless	1
manner;	1
and	1
Piedro,	1
with	1
ingenuity,	1
which	1
in	1
a	1
better	1
cause	1
would	1
have	1
deserved	1
admiration,	1
spoke	1
volubly	1
and	1
craftily	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
defence.	1
But	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
say	1
could	1
not	1
alter	1
facts.	1
The	1
judge	1
compared	1
the	1
notched	1
bit	1
of	1
wood	1
found	1
at	1
the	1
baker's	1
with	1
a	1
piece	1
from	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
cut,	1
which	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
see	1
in	1
the	1
yard	1
of	1
the	1
arsenal.	1
It	1
was	1
found	1
to	1
fit	1
exactly.	1
The	1
judge	1
then	1
found	1
it	1
impossible	1
to	1
restrain	1
the	1
loud	1
indignation	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
spectators.	1
The	1
prisoner	1
was	1
sentenced	1
never	1
more	1
to	1
sell	1
wood	1
in	1
the	1
market;	1
and	1
the	1
moment	1
sentence	1
was	1
pronounced,	1
Piedro	1
was	1
hissed	1
and	1
hooted	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
market-place.	1
Thus	1
a	1
third	1
time	1
he	1
deprived	1
himself	1
of	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
earning	1
his	1
bread.	1
We	1
shall	1
not	1
dwell	1
upon	1
all	1
his	1
petty	1
methods	1
of	1
cheating	1
in	1
the	1
trades	1
he	1
next	1
attempted.	1
He	1
handed	1
lemonade	1
about	1
in	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
Naples	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
known,	1
but	1
he	1
lost	1
his	1
customers	1
by	1
putting	1
too	1
much	1
water	1
and	1
too	1
little	1
lemon	1
into	1
this	1
beverage.	1
He	1
then	1
took	1
to	1
the	1
waters	1
from	1
the	1
sulphurous	1
springs,	1
and	1
served	1
them	1
about	1
to	1
foreigners;	1
but	1
one	1
day,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
trying	1
to	1
jostle	1
a	1
competitor	1
from	1
the	1
coach	1
door,	1
he	1
slipped	1
his	1
foot,	1
and	1
broke	1
his	1
glasses.	1
They	1
had	1
been	1
borrowed	1
from	1
an	1
old	1
woman,	1
who	1
hired	1
out	1
glasses	1
to	1
the	1
boys	1
who	1
sold	1
lemonade.	1
Piedro	1
knew	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
custom	1
to	1
pay,	1
of	1
course,	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
broken;	1
but	1
this	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
inclined	1
to	1
do.	1
He	1
had	1
a	1
few	1
shillings	1
in	1
his	1
pocket,	1
and	1
thought	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
very	1
clever	1
to	1
defraud	1
this	1
poor	1
woman	1
of	1
her	1
right,	1
and	1
to	1
spend	1
his	1
shillings	1
upon	1
what	1
he	1
valued	1
much	1
more	1
than	1
he	1
did	1
his	1
good	1
name--macaroni.	1
The	1
shillings	1
were	1
soon	1
gone.	1
We	1
shall	1
now	1
for	1
the	1
present	1
leave	1
Piedro	1
to	1
his	1
follies	1
and	1
his	1
fate;	1
or,	1
to	1
speak	1
more	1
properly,	1
to	1
his	1
follies	1
and	1
their	1
inevitable	1
consequences.	1
Francisco	1
was	1
all	1
this	1
time	1
acquiring	1
knowledge	1
from	1
his	1
new	1
friends,	1
without	1
neglecting	1
his	1
own	1
or	1
his	1
father's	1
business.	1
He	1
contrived,	1
during	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
autumn	1
and	1
winter,	1
to	1
make	1
himself	1
a	1
tolerable	1
arithmetician.	1
Carlo's	1
father	1
could	1
draw	1
plans	1
in	1
architecture	1
neatly;	1
and	1
pleased	1
with	1
the	1
eagerness	1
Francisco	1
showed	1
to	1
receive	1
instruction,	1
he	1
willingly	1
put	1
a	1
pencil	1
and	1
compasses	1
into	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
taught	1
him	1
all	1
he	1
knew	1
himself.	1
Francisco	1
had	1
great	1
perseverance,	1
and,	1
by	1
repeated	1
trials,	1
he	1
at	1
length	1
succeeded	1
in	1
copying	1
exactly	1
all	1
the	1
plans	1
which	1
his	1
master	1
lent	1
him.	1
His	1
copies,	1
in	1
time,	1
surpassed	1
the	1
originals,	1
and	1
Carlo	1
exclaimed,	1
with	1
astonishment:	1
"Why,	1
Francisco,	1
what	1
an	1
astonishing	1
GENIUS	1
you	1
have	1
for	1
drawing!--Absolutely	1
you	1
draw	1
plans	1
better	1
than	1
my	1
father!"	1
"As	1
to	1
genius,"	1
said	1
Francisco,	1
honestly,	1
"I	1
have	1
none.	1
All	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
has	1
been	1
done	1
by	1
hard	1
labour.	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
how	1
other	1
people	1
do	1
things;	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
that	1
I	1
never	1
have	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
get	1
anything	1
done	1
well	1
but	1
by	1
patience.	1
Don't	1
you	1
remember,	1
Carlo,	1
how	1
you	1
and	1
even	1
Rosetta	1
laughed	1
at	1
me	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
your	1
father	1
put	1
a	1
pencil	1
into	1
my	1
awkward,	1
clumsy	1
hands?"	1
"Because,"	1
said	1
Carlo,	1
laughing	1
again	1
at	1
the	1
recollection,	1
"you	1
held	1
your	1
pencil	1
so	1
drolly;	1
and	1
when	1
you	1
were	1
to	1
cut	1
it,	1
you	1
cut	1
it	1
just	1
as	1
if	1
you	1
were	1
using	1
a	1
pruning-knife	1
to	1
your	1
vines;	1
but	1
now	1
it	1
is	1
your	1
turn	1
to	1
laugh,	1
for	1
you	1
surpass	1
us	1
all.	1
And	1
the	1
times	1
are	1
changed	1
since	1
I	1
set	1
about	1
to	1
explain	1
this	1
rule	1
of	1
mine	1
to	1
you."	1
"Ay,	1
that	1
rule,"	1
said	1
Francisco--"how	1
much	1
I	1
owe	1
to	1
it!	1
Some	1
great	1
people,	1
when	1
they	1
lose	1
any	1
of	1
their	1
fine	1
things,	1
cause	1
the	1
crier	1
to	1
promise	1
a	1
reward	1
of	1
so	1
much	1
money	1
to	1
anyone	1
who	1
shall	1
find	1
and	1
restore	1
their	1
trinket.	1
How	1
richly	1
have	1
you	1
and	1
your	1
father	1
rewarded	1
me	1
for	1
returning	1
this	1
rule!"	1
Francisco's	1
modesty	1
and	1
gratitude,	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
perfectly	1
sincere,	1
attached	1
his	1
friends	1
to	1
him	1
most	1
powerfully;	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
one	1
person	1
who	1
regretted	1
our	1
hero's	1
frequent	1
absences	1
from	1
his	1
vineyard	1
at	1
Resina.	1
Not	1
Francisco's	1
father,	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
well	1
satisfied	1
his	1
son	1
never	1
neglected	1
his	1
business;	1
and	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
hours	1
spent	1
in	1
Naples,	1
he	1
had	1
so	1
much	1
confidence	1
in	1
Francisco	1
that	1
he	1
felt	1
no	1
apprehensions	1
of	1
his	1
getting	1
into	1
bad	1
company.	1
When	1
his	1
son	1
had	1
once	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
"I	1
spend	1
my	1
time	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
place,	1
and	1
in	1
such	1
and	1
such	1
a	1
manner,"	1
he	1
was	1
as	1
well	1
convinced	1
of	1
its	1
being	1
so	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
watched	1
and	1
seen	1
him	1
every	1
moment	1
of	1
the	1
day.	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
Arthur	1
who	1
complained	1
of	1
Francisco's	1
absence.	1
"I	1
see,	1
because	1
I	1
am	1
an	1
Englishman,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"you	1
don't	1
value	1
my	1
friendship,	1
and	1
yet	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
very	1
reason	1
you	1
ought	1
to	1
value	1
it;	1
no	1
friends	1
so	1
good	1
as	1
the	1
English,	1
be	1
it	1
spoken	1
without	1
offence	1
to	1
your	1
Italian	1
friend,	1
for	1
whom	1
you	1
now	1
continually	1
leave	1
me	1
to	1
dodge	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
here	1
in	1
Resina,	1
without	1
a	1
soul	1
that	1
I	1
like	1
to	1
speak	1
to,	1
for	1
you	1
are	1
the	1
only	1
Italian	1
I	1
ever	1
liked."	1
"You	1
shall	1
like	1
another,	1
I	1
promise	1
you,"	1
said	1
Francisco.	1
"You	1
must	1
come	1
with	1
me	1
to	1
Carlo's,	1
and	1
see	1
how	1
I	1
spend	1
my	1
evenings;	1
then	1
complain	1
of	1
me,	1
if	1
you	1
can."	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
utmost	1
stretch	1
of	1
Arthur's	1
complaisance	1
to	1
pay	1
this	1
visit;	1
but,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
national	1
prejudices	1
and	1
habitual	1
reserve	1
of	1
temper,	1
he	1
was	1
pleased	1
with	1
the	1
reception	1
he	1
met	1
with	1
from	1
the	1
generous	1
Carlo	1
and	1
the	1
playful	1
Rosetta.	1
They	1
showed	1
him	1
Francisco's	1
drawings	1
with	1
enthusiastic	1
eagerness;	1
and	1
Arthur,	1
though	1
no	1
great	1
judge	1
of	1
drawing,	1
was	1
in	1
astonishment,	1
and	1
frequently	1
repeated,	1
"I	1
know	1
a	1
gentleman	1
who	1
visits	1
my	1
master	1
who	1
would	1
like	1
these	1
things.	1
I	1
wish	1
I	1
might	1
have	1
them	1
to	1
show	1
him."	1
"Take	1
them,	1
then,"	1
said	1
Carlo;	1
"I	1
wish	1
all	1
Naples	1
could	1
see	1
them,	1
provided	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
liked	1
half	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
I	1
like	1
them."	1
Arthur	1
carried	1
off	1
the	1
drawings,	1
and	1
one	1
day,	1
when	1
his	1
master	1
was	1
better	1
than	1
usual,	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
leisure,	1
eating	1
a	1
dessert	1
of	1
Francisco's	1
grapes,	1
he	1
entered	1
respectfully,	1
with	1
his	1
little	1
portfolio	1
under	1
his	1
arm,	1
and	1
begged	1
permission	1
to	1
show	1
his	1
master	1
a	1
few	1
drawings	1
done	1
by	1
the	1
gardener's	1
son,	1
whose	1
grapes	1
he	1
was	1
eating.	1
Though	1
not	1
quite	1
so	1
partial	1
a	1
judge	1
as	1
the	1
enthusiastic	1
Carlo,	1
this	1
gentleman	1
was	1
both	1
pleased	1
and	1
surprised	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
these	1
drawings,	1
considering	1
how	1
short	1
a	1
time	1
Francisco	1
had	1
applied	1
himself	1
to	1
this	1
art,	1
and	1
what	1
slight	1
instructions	1
he	1
had	1
received.	1
Arthur	1
was	1
desired	1
to	1
summon	1
the	1
young	1
artist.	1
Francisco's	1
honest,	1
open	1
manner,	1
joined	1
to	1
the	1
proofs	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
of	1
his	1
abilities,	1
and	1
the	1
character	1
Arthur	1
gave	1
him	1
for	1
strict	1
honesty,	1
and	1
constant	1
kindness	1
to	1
his	1
parents,	1
interested	1
Mr.	1
Lee,	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
this	1
English	1
gentleman,	1
much	1
in	1
his	1
favour.	1
Mr.	1
Lee	1
was	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
in	1
treaty	1
with	1
an	1
Italian	1
painter,	1
whom	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
engage	1
to	1
copy	1
for	1
him	1
exactly	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
cornices,	1
mouldings,	1
tablets,	1
and	1
antique	1
ornaments	1
which	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
amongst	1
the	1
ruins	1
of	1
the	1
ancient	1
city	1
of	1
Herculaneum.	1

We	1
must	1
give	1
those	1
of	1
our	1
young	1
English	1
readers	1
who	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
acquainted	1
with	1
the	1
ancient	1
city	1
of	1
Herculaneum,	1
some	1
idea	1
of	1
it.	1
None	1
can	1
be	1
ignorant	1
that	1
near	1
Naples	1
is	1
the	1
celebrated	1
volcanic	1
mountain	1
of	1
Vesuvius;--that,	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time,	1
there	1
happen	1
violent	1
eruptions	1
from	1
this	1
mountain;	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
flames	1
and	1
immense	1
clouds	1
of	1
smoke	1
issue	1
from	1
different	1
openings,	1
mouths,	1
or	1
CRATERS,	1
as	1
they	1
are	1
called,	1
but	1
more	1
especially	1
from	1
the	1
summit	1
of	1
the	1
mountain,	1
which	1
is	1
distinguished	1
by	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
THE	1
crater.	1
A	1
rumbling,	1
and	1
afterwards	1
a	1
roaring	1
noise	1
is	1
heard	1
within,	1
and	1
prodigious	1
quantities	1
of	1
stones	1
and	1
minerals	1
burnt	1
into	1
masses	1
(scoriae),	1
are	1
thrown	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
crater,	1
sometimes	1
to	1
a	1
great	1
distance.	1
The	1
hot	1
ashes	1
from	1
Mount	1
Vesuvius	1
have	1
often	1
been	1
seen	1
upon	1
the	1
roofs	1
of	1
the	1
houses	1
of	1
Naples,	1
from	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
six	1
miles	1
distant.	1
Streams	1
of	1
lava	1
run	1
down	1
the	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
mountains	1
during	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
an	1
eruption,	1
destroying	1
everything	1
in	1
their	1
way,	1
and	1
overwhelm	1
the	1
houses	1
and	1
vineyards	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
neighbourhood.	1
About	1
17OO	1
years	1
ago,	1
during	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
Roman	1
Emperor	1
Titus,	1
there	1
happened	1
a	1
terrible	1
eruption	1
of	1
Mount	1
Vesuvius;	1
and	1
a	1
large	1
city	1
called	1
Herculaneum,	1
which	1
was	1
situated	1
at	1
about	1
four	1
miles'	1
distance	1
from	1
the	1
volcano,	1
was	1
overwhelmed	1
by	1
the	1
streams	1
of	1
lava	1
which	1
poured	1
into	1
it,	1
filled	1
up	1
the	1
streets,	1
and	1
quickly	1
covered	1
over	1
the	1
tops	1
of	1
the	1
houses,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
whole	1
was	1
no	1
more	1
visible.	1
It	1
remained	1
for	1
many	1
years	1
buried.	1
The	1
lava	1
which	1
covered	1
it	1
became	1
in	1
time	1
fit	1
for	1
vegetation,	1
plants	1
grew	1
there,	1
a	1
new	1
soil	1
was	1
formed,	1
and	1
a	1
new	1
town	1
called	1
Portici	1
was	1
built	1
over	1
this	1
place	1
where	1
Herculaneum	1
formerly	1
stood.	1
The	1
little	1
village	1
of	1
Resina	1
is	1
also	1
situated	1
near	1
the	1
spot.	1
About	1
fifty	1
years	1
ago,	1
in	1
a	1
poor	1
man's	1
garden	1
at	1
Resina,	1
a	1
hole	1
in	1
a	1
well	1
about	1
thirty	1
feet	1
below	1
the	1
surface	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
was	1
observed.	1
Some	1
persons	1
had	1
the	1
curiosity	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
this	1
hole,	1
and,	1
after	1
creeping	1
underground	1
for	1
some	1
time,	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
foundations	1
of	1
houses.	1
The	1
peasants,	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
village,	1
who	1
had	1
probably	1
never	1
heard	1
of	1
Herculaneum,	1
were	1
somewhat	1
surprised	1
at	1
their	1
discovery.**	1
About	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
in	1
a	1
pit	1
in	1
the	1
town	1
of	1
Portici,	1
a	1
similar	1
passage	1
underground	1
was	1
discovered,	1
and,	1
by	1
orders	1
of	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
Naples,	1
workmen	1
were	1
employed	1
to	1
dig	1
away	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
clear	1
the	1
passage.	1
They	1
found,	1
at	1
length,	1
the	1
entrance	1
into	1
the	1
town,	1
which,	1
during	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
Titus,	1
was	1
buried	1
under	1
lava.	1
It	1
was	1
about	1
eighty-eight	1
Neapolitan	1
palms	1
(a	1
palm	1
contains	1
near	1
nine	1
inches)	1
below	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
pit.	1
The	1
workmen,	1
as	1
they	1
cleared	1
the	1
passages,	1
marked	1
their	1
way	1
with	1
chalk	1
when	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
any	1
turning,	1
lest	1
they	1
should	1
lose	1
themselves.	1
The	1
streets	1
branched	1
out	1
in	1
many	1
directions,	1
and,	1
lying	1
across	1
them,	1
the	1
workmen	1
often	1
found	1
large	1
pieces	1
of	1
timber,	1
beams,	1
and	1
rafters;	1
some	1
broken	1
in	1
the	1
fall,	1
others	1
entire.	1
These	1
beams	1
and	1
rafters	1
are	1
burned	1
quite	1
black	1
like	1
charcoal,	1
except	1
those	1
that	1
were	1
found	1
in	1
moist	1
places,	1
which	1
have	1
more	1
the	1
colour	1
of	1
rotten	1
wood,	1
and	1
which	1
are	1
like	1
a	1
soft	1
paste,	1
into	1
which	1
you	1
might	1
run	1
your	1
hand.	1
The	1
walls	1
of	1
the	1
houses	1
slant,	1
some	1
one	1
way,	1
some	1
another,	1
and	1
some	1
are	1
upright.	1
Several	1
magnificent	1
buildings	1
of	1
brick,	1
faced	1
with	1
marble	1
of	1
different	1
colours,	1
are	1
partly	1
seen,	1
where	1
the	1
workmen	1
have	1
cleared	1
away	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
lava	1
with	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
encrusted.	1
Columns	1
of	1
red	1
and	1
white	1
marble,	1
and	1
flights	1
of	1
steps,	1
are	1
seen	1
in	1
different	1
places;	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
ruins	1
of	1
the	1
palaces	1
some	1
very	1
fine	1
statues	1
and	1
pictures	1
have	1
been	1
dug.	1
Foreigners	1
who	1
visit	1
Naples	1
are	1
very	1
curious	1
to	1
see	1
this	1
subterraneous	1
city,	1
and	1
are	1
desirous	1
to	1
carry	1
with	1
them	1
into	1
their	1
own	1
country	1
some	1
proofs	1
of	1
their	1
having	1
examined	1
this	1
wonderful	1
place.	1

CHAPTER	1
III.	1
Tutte	1
le	1
gran	1
faciende	1
si	1
fanno	1
di	1
poca	1
cosa.	1
What	1
great	1
events	1
from	1
trivial	1
causes	1
spring.	1
Signor	1
Camillo,	1
the	1
artist	1
employed	1
by	1
Mr.	1
Lee	1
to	1
copy	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
antique	1
ornaments	1
in	1
Herculaneum,	1
was	1
a	1
liberal	1
minded	1
man,	1
perfectly	1
free	1
from	1
that	1
mean	1
jealousy	1
which	1
would	1
repress	1
the	1
efforts	1
of	1
rising	1
genius.	1
"Here	1
is	1
a	1
lad	1
scarcely	1
fifteen,	1
a	1
poor	1
gardener's	1
son,	1
who,	1
with	1
merely	1
the	1
instructions	1
he	1
could	1
obtain	1
from	1
a	1
common	1
carpenter,	1
has	1
learned	1
to	1
draw	1
these	1
plans	1
and	1
elevations,	1
which	1
you	1
see	1
are	1
tolerably	1
neat.	1
What	1
an	1
advantage	1
your	1
instruction	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
him,"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Lee,	1
as	1
he	1
introduced	1
Francisco	1
to	1
Signor	1
Camillo.	1
"I	1
am	1
interested	1
in	1
this	1
lad	1
from	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
learned	1
of	1
his	1
good	1
conduct.	1
I	1
hear	1
he	1
is	1
strictly	1
honest,	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
sons.	1
Let	1
us	1
do	1
something	1
for	1
him.	1
If	1
you	1
will	1
give	1
him	1
some	1
knowledge	1
of	1
your	1
art,	1
I	1
will,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
money	1
can	1
recompense	1
you	1
for	1
your	1
loss	1
of	1
time,	1
pay	1
whatever	1
you	1
may	1
think	1
reasonable	1
for	1
his	1
instruction."	1
Signor	1
Camillo	1
made	1
no	1
difficulties;	1
he	1
was	1
pleased	1
with	1
his	1
pupil's	1
appearance,	1
and	1
every	1
day	1
he	1
liked	1
him	1
better	1
and	1
better.	1
In	1
the	1
room	1
where	1
they	1
worked	1
together	1
there	1
were	1
some	1
large	1
books	1
of	1
drawings	1
and	1
plates,	1
which	1
Francisco	1
saw	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
opened	1
by	1
his	1
master,	1
and	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
great	1
desire	1
to	1
look	1
over;	1
but	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
left	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
by	1
himself	1
he	1
never	1
touched	1
them,	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
permission.	1
Signor	1
Camillo,	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
he	1
came	1
into	1
this	1
room	1
with	1
his	1
pupil,	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
"Here	1
are	1
many	1
valuable	1
books	1
and	1
drawings,	1
young	1
man.	1
I	1
trust,	1
from	1
the	1
character	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
you,	1
that	1
they	1
will	1
be	1
perfectly	1
safe	1
here."	1
Some	1
weeks	1
after	1
Francisco	1
had	1
been	1
with	1
the	1
painter,	1
they	1
had	1
occasion	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
the	1
front	1
of	1
a	1
temple	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
large	1
books.	1
"What!	1
don't	1
you	1
know	1
in	1
which	1
book	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
it,	1
Francisco?"	1
cried	1
his	1
master,	1
with	1
some	1
impatience.	1
"Is	1
it	1
possible	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
been	1
here	1
so	1
long	1
with	1
these	1
books,	1
and	1
that	1
you	1
cannot	1
find	1
the	1
print	1
I	1
mean?	1
Had	1
you	1
half	1
the	1
taste	1
I	1
gave	1
you	1
credit	1
for,	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
singled	1
it	1
out	1
from	1
all	1
the	1
rest,	1
and	1
have	1
it	1
fixed	1
in	1
your	1
memory."	1
"But,	1
signor,	1
I	1
never	1
saw	1
it,"	1
said	1
Francisco,	1
respectfully,	1
"or,	1
perhaps,	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
preferred	1
it."	1
"That	1
you	1
never	1
saw	1
it,	1
young	1
man,	1
is	1
the	1
very	1
thing	1
of	1
which	1
I	1
complain.	1
Is	1
a	1
taste	1
for	1
the	1
arts	1
to	1
be	1
learned,	1
think	1
you,	1
by	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
cover	1
of	1
a	1
book	1
like	1
this?	1
Is	1
it	1
possible	1
that	1
you	1
never	1
thought	1
of	1
opening	1
it?"	1
"Often	1
and	1
often,"	1
cried	1
Francisco,	1
"have	1
I	1
longed	1
to	1
open	1
it;	1
but	1
I	1
thought	1
it	1
was	1
forbidden	1
me,	1
and	1
however	1
great	1
my	1
curiosity	1
in	1
your	1
absence,	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
touched	1
them.	1
I	1
hoped	1
indeed,	1
that	1
the	1
time	1
would	1
come	1
when	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
the	1
goodness	1
to	1
show	1
them	1
to	1
me."	1
"And	1
so	1
the	1
time	1
is	1
come,	1
excellent	1
young	1
man,"	1
cried	1
Camillo;	1
"much	1
as	1
I	1
love	1
taste,	1
I	1
love	1
integrity	1
more.	1
I	1
am	1
now	1
sure	1
of	1
your	1
having	1
the	1
one,	1
and	1
let	1
me	1
see	1
whether	1
you	1
have,	1
as	1
I	1
believe	1
you	1
have,	1
the	1
other.	1
Sit	1
you	1
down	1
here	1
beside	1
me;	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
look	1
over	1
these	1
books	1
together."	1
The	1
attention	1
with	1
which	1
his	1
young	1
pupil	1
examined	1
everything,	1
and	1
the	1
pleasure	1
he	1
unaffectedly	1
expressed	1
in	1
seeing	1
these	1
excellent	1
prints,	1
sufficiently	1
convinced	1
his	1
judicious	1
master	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
from	1
the	1
want	1
of	1
curiosity	1
or	1
taste	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
opened	1
these	1
tempting	1
volumes.	1
His	1
confidence	1
in	1
Francisco	1
was	1
much	1
increased	1
by	1
this	1
circumstance,	1
slight	1
as	1
it	1
may	1
appear.	1
One	1
day,	1
Signor	1
Camillo	1
came	1
behind	1
Francisco,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
drawing	1
with	1
much	1
intentness,	1
and	1
tapping	1
him	1
upon	1
the	1
shoulder,	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
him:	1
"Put	1
up	1
your	1
pencils	1
and	1
follow	1
me,	1
I	1
can	1
depend	1
upon	1
your	1
integrity;	1
I	1
have	1
pledged	1
myself	1
for	1
it.	1
Bring	1
your	1
note-book	1
with	1
you,	1
and	1
follow	1
me;	1
I	1
will	1
this	1
day	1
show	1
you	1
something	1
that	1
will	1
entertain	1
you	1
at	1
least	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
my	1
large	1
book	1
of	1
prints.	1
Follow	1
me."	1
Francisco	1
followed,	1
till	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
pit	1
near	1
the	1
entrance	1
of	1
Herculaneum.	1
"I	1
have	1
obtained	1
leave	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
accompany	1
me,"	1
said	1
his	1
master,	1
"and	1
you	1
know,	1
I	1
suppose,	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
permission	1
granted	1
to	1
everyone?"	1
Paintings	1
of	1
great	1
value,	1
besides	1
ornaments	1
of	1
gold	1
and	1
silver,	1
antique	1
bracelets,	1
rings,	1
etc.,	1
are	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time	1
found	1
amongst	1
these	1
ruins,	1
and	1
therefore	1
it	1
is	1
necessary	1
that	1
no	1
person	1
should	1
be	1
admitted	1
whose	1
honesty	1
cannot	1
be	1
depended	1
upon.	1
Thus,	1
even	1
Francisco's	1
talents	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
advanced	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
unless	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
united	1
to	1
integrity.	1
He	1
was	1
much	1
delighted	1
and	1
astonished	1
by	1
the	1
new	1
scene	1
that	1
was	1
now	1
opened	1
to	1
his	1
view;	1
and	1
as,	1
day	1
after	1
day,	1
he	1
accompanied	1
his	1
master	1
to	1
this	1
subterraneous	1
city,	1
he	1
had	1
leisure	1
for	1
observation.	1
He	1
was	1
employed,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
gratified	1
his	1
curiosity,	1
in	1
drawing.	1
There	1
are	1
niches	1
in	1
the	1
walls	1
in	1
several	1
places,	1
from	1
which	1
pictures	1
have	1
been	1
dug,	1
and	1
these	1
niches	1
are	1
often	1
adorned	1
with	1
elegant	1
masques,	1
figures	1
and	1
animals,	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
left	1
by	1
the	1
ignorant	1
or	1
careless	1
workmen,	1
and	1
which	1
are	1
going	1
fast	1
to	1
destruction.	1
Signor	1
Camillo,	1
who	1
was	1
copying	1
these	1
for	1
his	1
English	1
employer,	1
had	1
a	1
mind	1
to	1
try	1
his	1
pupil's	1
skill,	1
and,	1
pointing	1
to	1
a	1
niche	1
bordered	1
with	1
grotesque	1
figures,	1
he	1
desired	1
him	1
to	1
try	1
if	1
he	1
could	1
make	1
any	1
hand	1
of	1
it.	1
Francisco	1
made	1
several	1
trials,	1
and	1
at	1
last	1
finished	1
such	1
an	1
excellent	1
copy,	1
that	1
his	1
enthusiastic	1
and	1
generous	1
master,	1
with	1
warm	1
encomiums,	1
carried	1
it	1
immediately	1
to	1
his	1
patron,	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
pleasure	1
to	1
receive	1
from	1
Mr.	1
Lee	1
a	1
purse	1
containing	1
five	1
guineas,	1
as	1
a	1
reward	1
and	1
encouragement	1
for	1
his	1
pupil.	1
Francisco	1
had	1
no	1
sooner	1
received	1
this	1
money,	1
than	1
he	1
hurried	1
to	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
mother's	1
cottage.	1
His	1
mother,	1
some	1
months	1
before	1
this	1
time,	1
had	1
taken	1
a	1
small	1
dairy	1
farm;	1
and	1
her	1
son	1
had	1
once	1
heard	1
her	1
express	1
a	1
wish	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
but	1
rich	1
enough	1
to	1
purchase	1
a	1
remarkably	1
fine	1
brindled	1
cow,	1
which	1
belonged	1
to	1
a	1
farmer	1
in	1
the	1
neighbourhood.	1
"Here,	1
my	1
dear	1
mother,"	1
cried	1
Francisco,	1
pouring	1
the	1
guineas	1
into	1
her	1
lap;	1
"and	1
here,"	1
continued	1
he,	1
emptying	1
a	1
bag	1
which	1
contained	1
about	1
as	1
much	1
more,	1
in	1
small	1
Italian	1
coins,	1
the	1
profits	1
of	1
trade-money	1
he	1
had	1
fairly	1
earned	1
during	1
the	1
two	1
years	1
he	1
sold	1
fruit	1
amongst	1
the	1
little	1
Neapolitan	1
merchants;	1
"this	1
is	1
all	1
yours,	1
dearest	1
mother,	1
and	1
I	1
hope	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
enough	1
to	1
pay	1
for	1
the	1
brindled	1
cow.	1
Nay,	1
you	1
must	1
not	1
refuse	1
me-	1
-I	1
have	1
set	1
my	1
heart	1
upon	1
the	1
cow	1
being	1
milked	1
by	1
you	1
this	1
very	1
evening;	1
and	1
I'll	1
produce	1
my	1
best	1
bunches	1
of	1
grapes,	1
and	1
my	1
father,	1
perhaps,	1
will	1
give	1
us	1
a	1
melon;	1
for	1
I've	1
had	1
no	1
time	1
for	1
melons	1
this	1
season;	1
and	1
I'll	1
step	1
to	1
Naples	1
and	1
invite--may	1
I,	1
mother?--my	1
good	1
friends,	1
dear	1
Carlo	1
and	1
your	1
favourite	1
little	1
Rosetta,	1
and	1
my	1
old	1
drawing	1
master,	1
and	1
my	1
friend	1
Arthur,	1
and	1
we'll	1
sup	1
with	1
you	1
at	1
your	1
dairy."	1
The	1
happy	1
mother	1
thanked	1
her	1
son,	1
and	1
the	1
father	1
assured	1
him	1
that	1
neither	1
melon	1
nor	1
pine-apple	1
should	1
be	1
spared,	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
supper	1
worthy	1
of	1
his	1
friends.	1
The	1
brindled	1
cow	1
was	1
bought,	1
and	1
Arthur	1
and	1
Carlo	1
and	1
Rosetta	1
most	1
joyfully	1
accepted	1
their	1
invitation.	1
The	1
carpenter	1
had	1
unluckily	1
appointed	1
to	1
settle	1
a	1
long	1
account	1
that	1
day	1
with	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
employers,	1
and	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
accompany	1
his	1
children.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
delicious	1
evening;	1
they	1
left	1
Naples	1
just	1
as	1
the	1
sea-breeze,	1
after	1
the	1
heats	1
of	1
the	1
day,	1
was	1
most	1
refreshingly	1
felt.	1
The	1
walk	1
to	1
Resina,	1
the	1
vineyard,	1
the	1
dairy,	1
and	1
most	1
of	1
all,	1
the	1
brindled	1
cow,	1
were	1
praised	1
by	1
Carlo	1
and	1
Rosetta,	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
Italian	1
superlatives	1
which	1
signify,	1
"Most	1
beautiful!	1
most	1
delightful!	1
most	1
charming!"	1
Whilst	1
the	1
English	1
Arthur,	1
with	1
as	1
warm	1
a	1
heart,	1
was	1
more	1
temperate	1
in	1
his	1
praise,	1
declaring	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
"the	1
most	1
like	1
an	1
English	1
summer's	1
evening	1
of	1
any	1
he	1
had	1
ever	1
felt	1
since	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
Italy:	1
and	1
that,	1
moreover,	1
the	1
cream	1
was	1
almost	1
as	1
good	1
as	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
used	1
to	1
drink	1
in	1
Cheshire."	1
The	1
company,	1
who	1
were	1
all	1
pleased	1
with	1
each	1
other,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
gardener's	1
good	1
fruit,	1
which	1
he	1
produced	1
in	1
great	1
abundance,	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
of	1
separating	1
till	1
late.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
bright	1
moonlight	1
night,	1
and	1
Carlo	1
asked	1
his	1
friend	1
if	1
he	1
would	1
walk	1
with	1
them	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
Naples.	1
"Yes,	1
all	1
the	1
way	1
most	1
willingly,"	1
cried	1
Francisco,	1
"that	1
I	1
may	1
have	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
giving	1
to	1
your	1
father,	1
with	1
my	1
own	1
hands,	1
this	1
fine	1
bunch	1
of	1
grapes,	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
reserved	1
for	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
share."	1
"Add	1
this	1
fine	1
pine-apple	1
for	1
my	1
share,	1
then,"	1
said	1
his	1
father,	1
"and	1
a	1
pleasant	1
walk	1
to	1
you,	1
my	1
young	1
friends."	1
They	1
proceeded	1
gaily	1
along,	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
reached	1
Naples,	1
as	1
they	1
passed	1
through	1
the	1
square	1
where	1
the	1
little	1
merchants	1
held	1
their	1
market,	1
Francisco	1
pointed	1
to	1
the	1
spot	1
where	1
he	1
found	1
Carlo's	1
rule.	1
He	1
never	1
missed	1
an	1
opportunity	1
of	1
showing	1
his	1
friends	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
forget	1
their	1
former	1
kindness	1
to	1
him.	1
"That	1
rule,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"has	1
been	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
all	1
my	1
present	1
happiness,	1
and	1
I	1
thank	1
you	1
for--"	1
"Oh,	1
never	1
mind	1
thanking	1
him	1
now,"	1
interrupted	1
Rosetta,	1
"but	1
look	1
yonder,	1
and	1
tell	1
me	1
what	1
all	1
those	1
people	1
are	1
about."	1
She	1
pointed	1
to	1
a	1
group	1
of	1
men,	1
women	1
and	1
children,	1
who	1
were	1
assembled	1
under	1
a	1
piazza,	1
listening	1
in	1
various	1
attitudes	1
of	1
attention	1
to	1
a	1
man,	1
who	1
was	1
standing	1
upon	1
a	1
flight	1
of	1
steps	1
speaking	1
in	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
and	1
with	1
much	1
action,	1
to	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
surrounded	1
him.	1
Francisco,	1
Carlo	1
and	1
Rosetta	1
joined	1
his	1
audience.	1
The	1
moon	1
shone	1
full	1
upon	1
his	1
countenance,	1
which	1
was	1
very	1
expressive	1
and	1
which	1
varied	1
frequently	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
characters	1
of	1
the	1
persons	1
whose	1
history	1
he	1
was	1
telling,	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
changes	1
of	1
their	1
fortune.	1
This	1
man	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
called	1
Improvisatori--persons	1
who,	1
in	1
Italian	1
towns,	1
go	1
about	1
reciting	1
verses	1
or	1
telling	1
stories,	1
which	1
they	1
are	1
supposed	1
to	1
invent	1
as	1
they	1
go	1
on	1
speaking.	1
Some	1
of	1
these	1
people	1
speak	1
with	1
great	1
fluency,	1
and	1
collect	1
crowds	1
round	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
public	1
streets.	1
When	1
an	1
Improvisatore	1
sees	1
the	1
attention	1
of	1
his	1
audience	1
fixed,	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
comes	1
to	1
some	1
very	1
interesting	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
narrative,	1
he	1
dexterously	1
drops	1
his	1
hat	1
upon	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
pauses	1
till	1
his	1
auditors	1
have	1
paid	1
tribute	1
to	1
his	1
eloquence.	1
When	1
he	1
thinks	1
the	1
hat	1
sufficiently	1
full,	1
he	1
takes	1
it	1
up	1
again,	1
and	1
proceeds	1
with	1
his	1
story.	1
The	1
hat	1
was	1
dropped	1
just	1
as	1
Francisco	1
and	1
his	1
two	1
friends	1
came	1
under	1
the	1
piazza.	1
The	1
orator	1
had	1
finished	1
one	1
story,	1
and	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
commence	1
another.	1
He	1
fixed	1
his	1
eyes	1
upon	1
Francisco,	1
then	1
glanced	1
at	1
Carlo	1
and	1
Rosetta,	1
and	1
after	1
a	1
moment's	1
consideration	1
he	1
began	1
a	1
story	1
which	1
bore	1
some	1
resemblance	1
to	1
one	1
that	1
our	1
young	1
English	1
readers	1
may,	1
perhaps,	1
know	1
by	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
"Cornaro,	1
or	1
the	1
Grateful	1
Turk."	1
Francisco	1
was	1
deeply	1
interested	1
in	1
this	1
narrative,	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
hat	1
was	1
dropped,	1
he	1
eagerly	1
threw	1
in	1
his	1
contribution.	1
At	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
story,	1
when	1
the	1
speaker's	1
voice	1
stopped,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
momentary	1
silence,	1
which	1
was	1
broken	1
by	1
the	1
orator	1
himself,	1
who	1
exclaimed,	1
as	1
he	1
took	1
up	1
the	1
hat	1
which	1
lay	1
at	1
his	1
feet,	1
"My	1
friends,	1
here	1
is	1
some	1
mistake!	1
this	1
is	1
not	1
my	1
hat;	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
changed	1
whilst	1
I	1
was	1
taken	1
up	1
with	1
my	1
story.	1
Pray,	1
gentlemen,	1
find	1
my	1
hat	1
amongst	1
you;	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
remarkably	1
good	1
one,	1
a	1
present	1
from	1
a	1
nobleman	1
for	1
an	1
epigram	1
I	1
made.	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
lose	1
my	1
hat	1
for	1
twice	1
its	1
value.	1
It	1
has	1
my	1
name	1
written	1
withinside	1
of	1
it,	1
Dominicho,	1
Improvisatore.	1
Pray,	1
gentlemen,	1
examine	1
your	1
hats."	1
Everybody	1
present	1
examined	1
their	1
hats,	1
and	1
showed	1
them	1
to	1
Dominicho,	1
but	1
his	1
was	1
not	1
amongst	1
them.	1
No	1
one	1
had	1
left	1
the	1
company;	1
the	1
piazza	1
was	1
cleared,	1
and	1
searched	1
in	1
vain.	1
"The	1
hat	1
has	1
vanished	1
by	1
magic,"	1
said	1
Dominicho.	1
"Yes,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
magic	1
a	1
statue	1
moves,"	1
cried	1
Carlo,	1
pointing	1
to	1
a	1
figure	1
standing	1
in	1
a	1
niche,	1
which	1
had	1
hitherto	1
escaped	1
observation.	1
The	1
face	1
was	1
so	1
much	1
in	1
the	1
shade,	1
that	1
Carlo	1
did	1
not	1
at	1
first	1
perceive	1
that	1
the	1
statue	1
was	1
Piedro.	1
Piedro,	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
himself	1
discovered,	1
burst	1
into	1
a	1
loud	1
laugh,	1
and	1
throwing	1
down	1
Dominicho's	1
hat,	1
which	1
he	1
held	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
behind	1
him,	1
cried,	1
"A	1
pretty	1
set	1
of	1
novices!	1
Most	1
excellent	1
players	1
at	1
hide-and-seek	1
you	1
would	1
make."	1
Whether	1
Piedro	1
really	1
meant	1
to	1
have	1
carried	1
off	1
the	1
poor	1
man's	1
hat,	1
or	1
whether	1
he	1
was,	1
as	1
he	1
said,	1
merely	1
in	1
jest,	1
we	1
leave	1
it	1
to	1
those	1
who	1
know	1
his	1
general	1
character	1
to	1
decide.	1
Carlo	1
shook	1
his	1
head.	1
"Still	1
at	1
your	1
old	1
tricks,	1
Piedro,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"Remember	1
the	1
old	1
proverb:	1
No	1
fox	1
so	1
cunning	1
but	1
he	1
comes	1
to	1
the	1
furrier's	1
at	1
last."	1
*	1
*	1
Tutte	1
le	1
volpi	1
si	1
trovano	1
in	1
pellicera.	1
"I	1
defy	1
the	1
furrier	1
and	1
you,	1
too,"	1
replied	1
Piedro,	1
taking	1
up	1
his	1
own	1
ragged	1
hat.	1
"I	1
have	1
no	1
need	1
to	1
steal	1
hats;	1
I	1
can	1
afford	1
to	1
buy	1
better	1
than	1
you'll	1
have	1
upon	1
your	1
head.	1
Francisco,	1
a	1
word	1
with	1
you,	1
if	1
you	1
have	1
done	1
crying	1
at	1
the	1
pitiful	1
story	1
you	1
have	1
been	1
listening	1
to	1
so	1
attentively."	1
"And	1
what	1
would	1
you	1
say	1
to	1
me?"	1
said	1
Francisco,	1
following	1
him	1
a	1
few	1
steps.	1
"Do	1
not	1
detain	1
me	1
long,	1
because	1
my	1
friends	1
will	1
wait	1
for	1
me."	1
"If	1
they	1
are	1
friends,	1
they	1
can	1
wait,"	1
said	1
Piedro.	1
"You	1
need	1
not	1
be	1
ashamed	1
of	1
being	1
seen	1
in	1
my	1
company	1
now,	1
I	1
can	1
tell	1
you;	1
for	1
I	1
am,	1
as	1
I	1
always	1
told	1
you	1
I	1
should	1
be,	1
the	1
richest	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
two."	1
"Rich!	1
you	1
rich?"	1
cried	1
Francisco.	1
"Well,	1
then,	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
you	1
could	1
mean	1
to	1
trick	1
that	1
poor	1
man	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
good	1
hat."	1
"Impossible!"	1
said	1
Piedro.	1
Francisco	1
did	1
not	1
consider	1
that	1
those	1
who	1
have	1
habits	1
of	1
pilfering	1
continue	1
to	1
practise	1
them	1
often,	1
when	1
the	1
poverty	1
which	1
first	1
tempted	1
them	1
to	1
dishonesty	1
ceases.	1
"Impossible!	1
You	1
stare	1
when	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
I	1
am	1
rich;	1
but	1
the	1
thing	1
is	1
so.	1
Moreover,	1
I	1
am	1
well	1
with	1
my	1
father	1
at	1
home.	1
I	1
have	1
friends	1
in	1
Naples,	1
and	1
I	1
call	1
myself	1
Piedro	1
the	1
Lucky.	1
Look	1
you	1
here,"	1
said	1
he,	1
producing	1
an	1
old	1
gold	1
coin.	1
"This	1
does	1
not	1
smell	1
of	1
fish,	1
does	1
it?	1
My	1
father	1
is	1
no	1
longer	1
a	1
fisherman,	1
nor	1
I	1
either.	1
Neither	1
do	1
I	1
sell	1
sugar-plums	1
to	1
children:	1
nor	1
do	1
I	1
slave	1
myself	1
in	1
a	1
vineyard,	1
like	1
some	1
folks;	1
but	1
fortune,	1
when	1
I	1
least	1
expected	1
it,	1
has	1
stood	1
my	1
friend.	1
I	1
have	1
many	1
pieces	1
of	1
gold	1
like	1
this.	1
Digging	1
in	1
my	1
father's	1
garden,	1
it	1
was	1
my	1
luck	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
an	1
old	1
Roman	1
vessel	1
full	1
of	1
gold.	1
I	1
have	1
this	1
day	1
agreed	1
for	1
a	1
house	1
in	1
Naples	1
for	1
my	1
father.	1
We	1
shall	1
live,	1
whilst	1
we	1
can	1
afford	1
it,	1
like	1
great	1
folks,	1
you	1
will	1
see;	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
enjoy	1
the	1
envy	1
that	1
will	1
be	1
felt	1
by	1
some	1
of	1
my	1
old	1
friends,	1
the	1
little	1
Neapolitan	1
merchants,	1
who	1
will	1
change	1
their	1
note	1
when	1
they	1
see	1
my	1
change	1
of	1
fortune.	1
What	1
say	1
you	1
to	1
all	1
this,	1
Francisco	1
the	1
Honest?"	1
"That	1
I	1
wish	1
you	1
joy	1
of	1
your	1
prosperity,	1
and	1
hope	1
you	1
may	1
enjoy	1
it	1
long	1
and	1
well."	1
"Well,	1
no	1
doubt	1
of	1
that.	1
Everyone	1
who	1
has	1
it	1
enjoys	1
it	1
WELL.	1
He	1
always	1
dances	1
well	1
to	1
whom	1
fortune	1
pipes."	1
*	1
*	1
Assai	1
ben	1
balla	1
a	1
chi	1
fortuna	1
suona.	1
"Yes,	1
no	1
longer	1
pipe,	1
no	1
longer	1
dance,"	1
replied	1
Francisco;	1
and	1
here	1
they	1
parted;	1
for	1
Piedro	1
walked	1
away	1
abruptly,	1
much	1
mortified	1
to	1
perceive	1
that	1
his	1
prosperity	1
did	1
not	1
excite	1
much	1
envy,	1
or	1
command	1
any	1
additional	1
respect	1
from	1
Francisco.	1
"I	1
would	1
rather,"	1
said	1
Francisco,	1
when	1
he	1
returned	1
to	1
Carlo	1
and	1
Rosetta,	1
who	1
waited	1
for	1
him	1
under	1
the	1
portico,	1
where	1
he	1
left	1
them--"I	1
would	1
rather	1
have	1
such	1
good	1
friends	1
as	1
you,	1
Carlo	1
and	1
Arthur,	1
and	1
some	1
more	1
I	1
could	1
name,	1
and,	1
besides	1
that,	1
have	1
a	1
clear	1
conscience,	1
and	1
work	1
honestly	1
for	1
my	1
bread,	1
than	1
be	1
as	1
lucky	1
as	1
Piedro.	1
Do	1
you	1
know	1
he	1
has	1
found	1
a	1
treasure,	1
he	1
says,	1
in	1
his	1
father's	1
garden--a	1
vase	1
full	1
of	1
gold?	1
He	1
showed	1
me	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
gold	1
pieces."	1
"Much	1
good	1
may	1
they	1
do	1
him.	1
I	1
hope	1
he	1
came	1
honestly	1
by	1
them,"	1
said	1
Carlo;	1
"but	1
ever	1
since	1
the	1
affair	1
of	1
the	1
double	1
measure,	1
I	1
suspect	1
double-dealing	1
always	1
from	1
him.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
our	1
affair,	1
however.	1
Let	1
him	1
make	1
himself	1
happy	1
his	1
way,	1
and	1
we	1
ours.	1
"He	1
that	1
would	1
live	1
in	1
peace	1
and	1
rest,	1
Must	1
hear,	1
and	1
see,	1
and	1
say	1
the	1
best."	1
*	1
*	1
Odi,	1
vedi,	1
taci,	1
se	1
vuoi	1
viver	1
in	1
pace.	1
All	1
Piedro's	1
neighbours	1
did	1
not	1
follow	1
this	1
peaceable	1
maxim;	1
for	1
when	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
father	1
began	1
to	1
circulate	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
the	1
treasure	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
garden,	1
the	1
village	1
of	1
Resina	1
did	1
not	1
give	1
them	1
implicit	1
faith.	1
People	1
nodded	1
and	1
whispered,	1
and	1
shrugged	1
their	1
shoulders;	1
then	1
crossed	1
themselves,	1
and	1
declared	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
not,	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
riches	1
of	1
Naples,	1
change	1
places	1
with	1
either	1
Piedro	1
or	1
his	1
father.	1
Regardless,	1
or	1
pretending	1
to	1
be	1
regardless,	1
of	1
these	1
suspicions,	1
Piedro	1
and	1
his	1
father	1
persisted	1
in	1
their	1
assertions.	1
The	1
fishing-nets	1
were	1
sold,	1
and	1
everything	1
in	1
their	1
cottage	1
was	1
disposed	1
of;	1
they	1
left	1
Resina,	1
went	1
to	1
live	1
at	1
Naples,	1
and,	1
after	1
a	1
few	1
weeks,	1
the	1
matter	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
almost	1
forgotten	1
in	1
the	1
village.	1
The	1
old	1
gardener,	1
Francisco's	1
father,	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
THINK	1
THE	1
BEST;	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
said	1
upon	1
the	1
subject	1
was,	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
exchange	1
Francisco	1
the	1
Honest	1
for	1
Piedro	1
the	1
Lucky;	1
that	1
one	1
can't	1
judge	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
till	1
one	1
sees	1
the	1
evening	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
morning.	1

"Compute	1
the	1
morn	1
and	1
evening	1
of	1
their	1
day."--Pope.	1
Not	1
to	1
leave	1
our	1
readers	1
longer	1
in	1
suspense,	1
we	1
must	1
inform	1
them	1
that	1
the	1
peasants	1
of	1
Resina	1
were	1
right	1
in	1
their	1
suspicions.	1
Piedro	1
had	1
never	1
found	1
any	1
treasure	1
in	1
his	1
father's	1
garden,	1
but	1
he	1
came	1
by	1
his	1
gold	1
in	1
the	1
following	1
manner:--	1
After	1
he	1
was	1
banished	1
from	1
the	1
little	1
wood-market	1
for	1
stealing	1
Rosetta's	1
basketful	1
of	1
wood,	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
cheated	1
the	1
poor	1
woman,	1
who	1
let	1
glasses	1
out	1
to	1
hire,	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
value	1
of	1
the	1
glasses	1
which	1
he	1
broke,	1
and,	1
in	1
short,	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
entirely	1
lost	1
his	1
credit	1
with	1
all	1
who	1
knew	1
him,	1
he	1
roamed	1
about	1
the	1
streets	1
of	1
Naples,	1
reckless	1
of	1
what	1
became	1
of	1
him.	1
He	1
found	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
the	1
proverb,	1
"that	1
credit	1
lost	1
is	1
like	1
a	1
Venice	1
glass	1
broken--it	1
can't	1
be	1
mended	1
again."	1
The	1
few	1
shillings	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
in	1
his	1
pocket	1
supplied	1
him	1
with	1
food	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
days.	1
At	1
last	1
he	1
was	1
glad	1
to	1
be	1
employed	1
by	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
peasants	1
who	1
came	1
to	1
Naples	1
to	1
load	1
their	1
asses	1
with	1
manure	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
streets.	1
They	1
often	1
follow	1
very	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
or	1
during	1
the	1
night-time,	1
the	1
trace	1
of	1
carriages	1
that	1
are	1
gone,	1
or	1
that	1
are	1
returning	1
from	1
the	1
opera;	1
and	1
Piedro	1
was	1
one	1
night	1
at	1
this	1
work,	1
when	1
the	1
horses	1
of	1
a	1
nobleman's	1
carriage	1
took	1
fright	1
at	1
the	1
sudden	1
blaze	1
of	1
some	1
fireworks.	1
The	1
carriage	1
was	1
overturned	1
near	1
him;	1
a	1
lady	1
was	1
taken	1
out	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
was	1
hurried	1
by	1
her	1
attendants	1
into	1
a	1
shop,	1
where	1
she	1
stayed	1
till	1
her	1
carriage	1
was	1
set	1
to	1
rights.	1
She	1
was	1
too	1
much	1
alarmed	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
ten	1
minutes	1
after	1
her	1
accident	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
anything;	1
but	1
after	1
some	1
time,	1
she	1
perceived	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
lost	1
a	1
valuable	1
diamond	1
cross,	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
worn	1
that	1
night	1
at	1
the	1
opera.	1
She	1
was	1
uncertain	1
where	1
she	1
had	1
dropped	1
it;	1
the	1
shop,	1
the	1
carriage,	1
the	1
street,	1
were	1
searched	1
for	1
it	1
in	1
vain.	1
Piedro	1
saw	1
it	1
fall	1
as	1
the	1
lady	1
was	1
lifted	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
carriage,	1
seized	1
upon	1
it,	1
and	1
carried	1
it	1
off.	1
Ignorant	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
of	1
the	1
full	1
value	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
stolen,	1
he	1
knew	1
not	1
how	1
to	1
satisfy	1
himself	1
as	1
to	1
this	1
point,	1
without	1
trusting	1
someone	1
with	1
the	1
secret.	1
After	1
some	1
hesitation,	1
he	1
determined	1
to	1
apply	1
to	1
a	1
Jew,	1
who,	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
whispered,	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
buy	1
everything	1
that	1
was	1
offered	1
to	1
him	1
for	1
sale,	1
without	1
making	1
any	1
TROUBLESOME	1
inquiries.	1
It	1
was	1
late;	1
he	1
waited	1
till	1
the	1
streets	1
were	1
cleared,	1
and	1
then	1
knocked	1
softly	1
at	1
the	1
back	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
Jew's	1
house.	1
The	1
person	1
who	1
opened	1
the	1
door	1
for	1
Piedro	1
was	1
his	1
own	1
father.	1
Piedro	1
started	1
back;	1
but	1
his	1
father	1
had	1
fast	1
hold	1
of	1
him.	1
"What	1
brings	1
you	1
here?"	1
said	1
the	1
father,	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice,	1
a	1
voice	1
which	1
expressed	1
fear	1
and	1
rage	1
mixed.	1
"Only	1
to	1
ask	1
my	1
way--my	1
shortest	1
way,"	1
stammered	1
Piedro.	1
"No	1
equivocations!	1
Tell	1
me	1
what	1
brings	1
you	1
here	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
night?	1
I	1
WILL	1
know."	1
Piedro,	1
who	1
felt	1
himself	1
in	1
his	1
father's	1
grasp,	1
and	1
who	1
knew	1
that	1
his	1
father	1
would	1
certainly	1
search	1
him,	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
brought	1
to	1
sell,	1
thought	1
it	1
most	1
prudent	1
to	1
produce	1
the	1
diamond	1
cross.	1
His	1
father	1
could	1
but	1
just	1
see	1
its	1
lustre	1
by	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
a	1
dim	1
lamp,	1
which	1
hung	1
over	1
their	1
heads	1
in	1
the	1
gloomy	1
passage	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
stood.	1
"You	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
duped,	1
if	1
you	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
sell	1
this	1
to	1
the	1
Jew.	1
It	1
is	1
well	1
it	1
has	1
fallen	1
into	1
my	1
hands.	1
How	1
came	1
you	1
by	1
it?"	1
Piedro	1
answered	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
found	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
street.	1
"Go	1
your	1
ways	1
home,	1
then,"	1
said	1
his	1
father;	1
"it	1
is	1
safe	1
with	1
me.	1
Concern	1
yourself	1
no	1
more	1
about	1
it."	1
Piedro	1
was	1
not	1
inclined	1
thus	1
to	1
relinquish	1
his	1
booty,	1
and	1
he	1
now	1
thought	1
proper	1
to	1
vary	1
in	1
his	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
manner	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
found	1
the	1
cross.	1
He	1
now	1
confessed	1
that	1
it	1
had	1
dropped	1
from	1
the	1
dress	1
of	1
a	1
lady,	1
whose	1
carriage	1
was	1
overturned	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
coming	1
home	1
from	1
the	1
opera,	1
and	1
he	1
concluded	1
by	1
saying	1
that,	1
if	1
his	1
father	1
took	1
his	1
prize	1
from	1
him	1
without	1
giving	1
him	1
his	1
share	1
of	1
the	1
profits,	1
he	1
would	1
go	1
directly	1
to	1
the	1
shop	1
where	1
the	1
lady	1
stopped	1
whilst	1
her	1
servants	1
were	1
raising	1
the	1
carriage,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
give	1
notice	1
of	1
his	1
having	1
found	1
the	1
cross.	1
Piedro's	1
father	1
saw	1
that	1
his	1
SMART	1
son,	1
though	1
scarcely	1
sixteen	1
years	1
of	1
age,	1
was	1
a	1
match	1
for	1
him	1
in	1
villainy.	1
He	1
promised	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
have	1
half	1
of	1
whatever	1
the	1
Jew	1
would	1
give	1
for	1
the	1
diamonds,	1
and	1
Piedro	1
insisted	1
upon	1
being	1
present	1
at	1
the	1
transaction.	1
We	1
do	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
lay	1
open	1
to	1
our	1
young	1
readers	1
scenes	1
of	1
iniquity.	1
It	1
is	1
sufficient	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
the	1
Jew,	1
who	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
old	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
arts	1
of	1
villainy,	1
contrived	1
to	1
cheat	1
both	1
his	1
associates,	1
and	1
obtained	1
the	1
diamond	1
cross	1
for	1
less	1
than	1
half	1
its	1
value.	1
The	1
matter	1
was	1
managed	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
transaction	1
remained	1
undiscovered.	1
The	1
lady	1
who	1
lost	1
the	1
cross,	1
after	1
making	1
fruitless	1
inquiries,	1
gave	1
up	1
the	1
search,	1
and	1
Piedro	1
and	1
his	1
father	1
rejoiced	1
in	1
the	1
success	1
of	1
their	1
manoeuvres.	1
It	1
is	1
said,	1
that	1
"Ill	1
gotten	1
wealth	1
is	1
quickly	1
spent";	1
*	1
and	1
so	1
it	1
proved	1
in	1
this	1
instance.	1
Both	1
father	1
and	1
son	1
lived	1
a	1
riotous	1
life	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
their	1
money	1
lasted,	1
and	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
last	1
many	1
months.	1
What	1
his	1
bad	1
education	1
began,	1
bad	1
company	1
finished,	1
and	1
Piedro's	1
mind	1
was	1
completely	1
ruined	1
by	1
the	1
associates	1
with	1
whom	1
he	1
became	1
connected	1
during	1
what	1
he	1
called	1
his	1
PROSPERITY.	1
When	1
his	1
money	1
was	1
at	1
an	1
end,	1
these	1
unprincipled	1
friends	1
began	1
to	1
look	1
cold	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
at	1
last	1
plainly	1
told	1
him--"If	1
you	1
mean	1
to	1
LIVE	1
WITH	1
US,	1
you	1
must	1
LIVE	1
AS	1
WE	1
DO."	1
They	1
lived	1
by	1
robbery.	1
*	1
Vien	1
presto	1
consumato	1
l'ingiustamente	1
acquistato.	1
Piedro,	1
though	1
familiarized	1
to	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
fraud,	1
was	1
shocked	1
at	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
becoming	1
a	1
robber	1
by	1
profession.	1
How	1
difficult	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
stop	1
in	1
the	1
career	1
of	1
vice!	1
Whether	1
Piedro	1
had	1
power	1
to	1
stop,	1
or	1
whether	1
he	1
was	1
hurried	1
on	1
by	1
his	1
associates,	1
we	1
shall,	1
for	1
the	1
present,	1
leave	1
in	1
doubt.	1
CHAPTER	1
IV	1
We	1
turn	1
with	1
pleasure	1
from	1
Piedro	1
the	1
Cunning	1
to	1
Francisco	1
the	1
Honest.	1
Francisco	1
continued	1
the	1
happy	1
and	1
useful	1
course	1
of	1
his	1
life.	1
By	1
his	1
unremitting	1
perseverance,	1
he	1
improved	1
himself	1
rapidly	1
under	1
the	1
instructions	1
of	1
his	1
master	1
and	1
friend,	1
Signor	1
Camillo;	1
his	1
friend,	1
we	1
say,	1
for	1
the	1
fair	1
and	1
open	1
character	1
of	1
Francisco	1
won,	1
or	1
rather	1
earned,	1
the	1
friendship	1
of	1
this	1
benevolent	1
artist.	1
The	1
English	1
gentleman	1
seemed	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
pride	1
in	1
our	1
hero's	1
success	1
and	1
good	1
conduct.	1
He	1
was	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
patrons	1
who	1
think	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
done	1
enough	1
when	1
they	1
have	1
given	1
five	1
guineas.	1
His	1
servant	1
Arthur	1
always	1
considered	1
every	1
generous	1
action	1
of	1
his	1
master's	1
as	1
his	1
own,	1
and	1
was	1
particularly	1
pleased	1
whenever	1
this	1
generosity	1
was	1
directed	1
towards	1
Francisco.	1
As	1
for	1
Carlo	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
Rosetta,	1
they	1
were	1
the	1
companions	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
pleasant	1
walks	1
which	1
Francisco	1
used	1
to	1
take	1
in	1
the	1
cool	1
of	1
the	1
evening,	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
shut	1
up	1
all	1
day	1
at	1
his	1
work.	1
And	1
the	1
old	1
carpenter,	1
delighted	1
with	1
the	1
gratitude	1
of	1
his	1
pupil,	1
frequently	1
repeated--"that	1
he	1
was	1
proud	1
to	1
have	1
given	1
the	1
first	1
instructions	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
GENIUS;	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
always	1
prophesied	1
Francisco	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
GREAT	1
man."	1
"And	1
a	1
good	1
man,	1
papa,"	1
said	1
Rosetta;	1
"for	1
though	1
he	1
has	1
grown	1
so	1
great,	1
and	1
though	1
he	1
goes	1
into	1
palaces	1
now,	1
to	1
say	1
nothing	1
of	1
that	1
place	1
underground,	1
where	1
he	1
has	1
leave	1
to	1
go,	1
yet,	1
notwithstanding	1
all	1
this,	1
he	1
never	1
forgets	1
my	1
brother	1
Carlo	1
and	1
you."	1
"That's	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
have	1
good	1
friends,"	1
said	1
the	1
carpenter.	1
"And	1
I	1
like	1
his	1
way;	1
he	1
does	1
more	1
than	1
he	1
says.	1
Facts	1
are	1
masculine,	1
and	1
words	1
are	1
feminine."	1
*	1
*	1
I	1
fatti	1
sono	1
maschii,	1
le	1
parole	1
femmine.	1
These	1
goods	1
friends	1
seemed	1
to	1
make	1
Francisco	1
happier	1
than	1
Piedro	1
could	1
be	1
made	1
by	1
his	1
stolen	1
diamonds.	1
One	1
morning,	1
Francisco	1
was	1
sent	1
to	1
finish	1
a	1
sketch	1
of	1
the	1
front	1
of	1
an	1
ancient	1
temple,	1
amongst	1
the	1
ruins	1
of	1
Herculaneum.	1
He	1
had	1
just	1
reached	1
the	1
pit,	1
and	1
the	1
men	1
were	1
about	1
to	1
let	1
him	1
down	1
with	1
cords,	1
in	1
the	1
usual	1
manner,	1
when	1
his	1
attention	1
was	1
caught	1
by	1
the	1
shrill	1
sound	1
of	1
a	1
scolding	1
woman's	1
voice.	1
He	1
looked,	1
and	1
saw	1
at	1
some	1
paces	1
distant	1
this	1
female	1
fury,	1
who	1
stood	1
guarding	1
the	1
windlass	1
of	1
a	1
well,	1
to	1
which,	1
with	1
threatening	1
gestures	1
and	1
most	1
voluble	1
menaces,	1
she	1
forbade	1
all	1
access.	1
The	1
peasants--men,	1
women	1
and	1
children,	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
with	1
their	1
pitchers	1
to	1
draw	1
water	1
at	1
this	1
well--were	1
held	1
at	1
bay	1
by	1
the	1
enraged	1
female.	1
Not	1
one	1
dared	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
advance;	1
whilst	1
she	1
grasped	1
with	1
one	1
hand	1
the	1
handle	1
of	1
the	1
windlass,	1
and,	1
with	1
the	1
other	1
tanned	1
muscular	1
arm	1
extended,	1
governed	1
the	1
populace,	1
bidding	1
them	1
remember	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
padrona,	1
or	1
mistress	1
of	1
the	1
well.	1
They	1
retired,	1
in	1
hopes	1
of	1
finding	1
a	1
more	1
gentle	1
padrona	1
at	1
some	1
other	1
well	1
in	1
the	1
neighbourhood;	1
and	1
the	1
fury,	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
out	1
of	1
sight,	1
divided	1
the	1
long	1
black	1
hair	1
which	1
hung	1
over	1
her	1
face,	1
and,	1
turning	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
spectators,	1
appealed	1
to	1
them	1
in	1
a	1
sober	1
voice,	1
and	1
asked	1
if	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
right	1
in	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
done?	1
"I,	1
that	1
am	1
padrona	1
of	1
the	1
well,"	1
said	1
she,	1
addressing	1
herself	1
to	1
Francisco,	1
who,	1
with	1
great	1
attention,	1
was	1
contemplating	1
her	1
with	1
the	1
eye	1
of	1
a	1
painter--"I,	1
that	1
am	1
padrona	1
of	1
the	1
well,	1
must	1
in	1
times	1
of	1
scarcity	1
do	1
strict	1
justice,	1
and	1
preserve	1
for	1
ourselves	1
alone	1
the	1
water	1
of	1
our	1
well.	1
There	1
is	1
scarcely	1
enough	1
even	1
for	1
ourselves.	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
obliged	1
to	1
make	1
my	1
husband	1
lengthen	1
the	1
ropes	1
every	1
day	1
for	1
this	1
week	1
past.	1
If	1
things	1
go	1
on	1
at	1
this	1
rate,	1
there	1
will	1
soon	1
be	1
not	1
one	1
drop	1
of	1
water	1
left	1
in	1
my	1
well."	1
"Nor	1
in	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
wells	1
of	1
the	1
neighbourhood,"	1
added	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
workmen,	1
who	1
was	1
standing	1
by;	1
and	1
he	1
mentioned	1
several	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
water	1
had	1
lately	1
suddenly	1
decreased;	1
and	1
a	1
miller	1
affirmed	1
that	1
his	1
mill	1
had	1
stopped	1
for	1
want	1
of	1
water.	1
Francisco	1
was	1
struck	1
by	1
these	1
remarks.	1
They	1
brought	1
to	1
his	1
recollection	1
similar	1
facts,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
often	1
heard	1
his	1
father	1
mention	1
in	1
his	1
childhood,	1
as	1
having	1
been	1
observed	1
previous	1
to	1
the	1
last	1
eruption	1
of	1
Mount	1
Vesuvius.	1
*	1
He	1
had	1
also	1
heard	1
from	1
his	1
father,	1
in	1
his	1
childhood,	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
better	1
to	1
trust	1
to	1
prudence	1
than	1
to	1
fortune;	1
and	1
therefore,	1
though	1
the	1
peasants	1
and	1
workmen,	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
mentioned	1
his	1
fears,	1
laughed,	1
and	1
said,	1
"That	1
as	1
the	1
burning	1
mountain	1
had	1
been	1
favourable	1
to	1
them	1
for	1
so	1
many	1
years,	1
they	1
would	1
trust	1
to	1
it	1
and	1
St.	1
Januarius	1
one	1
day	1
longer,"	1
yet	1
Francisco	1
immediately	1
gave	1
up	1
all	1
thoughts	1
of	1
spending	1
this	1
day	1
amidst	1
the	1
ruins	1
of	1
Herculaneum.	1
After	1
having	1
inquired	1
sufficiently,	1
after	1
having	1
seen	1
several	1
wells,	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
water	1
had	1
evidently	1
decreased,	1
and	1
after	1
having	1
seen	1
the	1
mill-wheels	1
that	1
were	1
standing	1
still	1
for	1
want	1
of	1
their	1
usual	1
supply,	1
he	1
hastened	1
home	1
to	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
mother,	1
reported	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
and	1
seen,	1
and	1
begged	1
of	1
them	1
to	1
remove,	1
and	1
to	1
take	1
what	1
things	1
of	1
value	1
they	1
could	1
to	1
some	1
distance	1
from	1
the	1
dangerous	1
spot	1
where	1
they	1
now	1
resided.	1

Some	1
of	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Resina,	1
whom	1
he	1
questioned,	1
declared	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
heard	1
strange	1
rumbling	1
noises	1
underground;	1
and	1
a	1
peasant	1
and	1
his	1
son,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
at	1
work	1
the	1
preceding	1
day	1
in	1
a	1
vineyard,	1
a	1
little	1
above	1
the	1
village,	1
related	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
seen	1
a	1
sudden	1
puff	1
of	1
smoke	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
close	1
to	1
them;	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
had,	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
heard	1
a	1
noise	1
like	1
the	1
going	1
off	1
of	1
a	1
pistol.	1
*	1
*	1
These	1
facts	1
are	1
mentioned	1
in	1
Sir	1
William	1
Hamilton's	1
account	1
of	1
an	1
eruption	1
of	1
Mount	1
Vesuvius.--See	1
Phil.	1
Trans.	1
1795,	1
first	1
part.	1
The	1
villagers	1
listened	1
with	1
large	1
eyes	1
and	1
open	1
ears	1
to	1
these	1
relations;	1
yet	1
such	1
was	1
their	1
habitual	1
attachment	1
to	1
the	1
spot	1
they	1
lived	1
upon,	1
or	1
such	1
the	1
security	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
good	1
fortune,	1
that	1
few	1
of	1
them	1
would	1
believe	1
that	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
any	1
necessity	1
for	1
removing.--"We'll	1
see	1
what	1
will	1
happen	1
to-morrow;	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
safe	1
here	1
one	1
day	1
longer,"	1
said	1
they.	1
Francisco's	1
father	1
and	1
mother,	1
more	1
prudent	1
than	1
the	1
generality	1
of	1
their	1
neighbours,	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
a	1
relation,	1
at	1
some	1
miles'	1
distance	1
from	1
Vesuvius,	1
and	1
carried	1
with	1
them	1
all	1
their	1
effects.	1
In	1
the	1
meantime,	1
Francisco	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
villa	1
where	1
his	1
English	1
friends	1
resided.	1
The	1
villa	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
most	1
dangerous	1
situation,	1
near	1
Terre	1
del	1
Greco--a	1
town	1
that	1
stands	1
at	1
the	1
foot	1
of	1
Mount	1
Vesuvius.	1
He	1
related	1
all	1
the	1
facts	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
to	1
Arthur,	1
who,	1
not	1
having	1
been,	1
like	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Resina,	1
familiarized	1
to	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
living	1
in	1
the	1
vicinity	1
of	1
a	1
burning	1
mountain,	1
and	1
habituated	1
to	1
trust	1
in	1
St.	1
Januarius,	1
was	1
sufficiently	1
alarmed	1
by	1
Francisco's	1
representations.	1
He	1
ran	1
to	1
his	1
master's	1
apartment,	1
and	1
communicated	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
just	1
heard.	1
The	1
Count	1
de	1
Flora	1
and	1
his	1
lady,	1
who	1
were	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
in	1
the	1
house,	1
ridiculed	1
the	1
fears	1
of	1
Arthur,	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
prevailed	1
upon	1
to	1
remove	1
even	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
Naples.	1
The	1
lady	1
was	1
intent	1
upon	1
preparations	1
for	1
her	1
birthday,	1
which	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
celebrated	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
with	1
great	1
magnificence	1
at	1
their	1
villa;	1
and	1
she	1
observed	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
pity	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
town	1
before	1
that	1
day,	1
and	1
they	1
had	1
everything	1
arranged	1
for	1
the	1
festival.	1
The	1
prudent	1
Englishman	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
gallantry	1
to	1
appear	1
to	1
be	1
convinced	1
by	1
these	1
arguments,	1
and	1
he	1
left	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
danger.	1
He	1
left	1
it	1
not	1
too	1
soon,	1
for	1
the	1
next	1
morning	1
exhibited	1
a	1
scene--a	1
scene	1
which	1
we	1
shall	1
not	1
attempt	1
to	1
describe.	1
We	1
refer	1
our	1
young	1
readers	1
to	1
the	1
account	1
of	1
this	1
dreadful	1
eruption	1
of	1
Mount	1
Vesuvius,	1
published	1
by	1
Sir	1
W.	1
Hamilton	1
in	1
the	1
"Philosophical	1
Transactions."	1
It	1
is	1
sufficient	1
here	1
to	1
say	1
that,	1
in	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
about	1
five	1
hours,	1
the	1
wretched	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Torre	1
del	1
Greco	1
saw	1
their	1
town	1
utterly	1
destroyed	1
by	1
the	1
streams	1
of	1
burning	1
lava	1
which	1
poured	1
from	1
the	1
mountain.	1
The	1
villa	1
of	1
Count	1
de	1
Flora,	1
with	1
some	1
others,	1
which	1
were	1
at	1
a	1
little	1
distance	1
from	1
the	1
town,	1
escaped;	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
absolutely	1
surrounded	1
by	1
the	1
lava.	1
The	1
count	1
and	1
countess	1
were	1
obliged	1
to	1
fly	1
from	1
their	1
house	1
with	1
the	1
utmost	1
precipitation	1
in	1
the	1
night-time;	1
and	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
time	1
to	1
remove	1
any	1
of	1
their	1
furniture,	1
their	1
plate,	1
clothes,	1
or	1
jewels.	1
A	1
few	1
days	1
after	1
the	1
eruption,	1
the	1
surface	1
of	1
the	1
lava	1
became	1
so	1
cool	1
that	1
people	1
could	1
walk	1
upon	1
it,	1
though	1
several	1
feet	1
beneath	1
the	1
surface	1
it	1
was	1
still	1
exceedingly	1
hot.	1
Numbers	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
forced	1
from	1
their	1
houses	1
now	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
ruins	1
to	1
try	1
to	1
save	1
whatever	1
they	1
could.	1
But	1
these	1
unfortunate	1
persons	1
frequently	1
found	1
their	1
houses	1
had	1
been	1
pillaged	1
by	1
robbers,	1
who,	1
in	1
these	1
moments	1
of	1
general	1
confusion,	1
enrich	1
themselves	1
with	1
the	1
spoils	1
of	1
their	1
fellow-creatures.	1
"Has	1
the	1
count	1
abandoned	1
his	1
villa?	1
and	1
is	1
there	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
take	1
care	1
of	1
his	1
plate	1
and	1
furniture?	1
The	1
house	1
will	1
certainly	1
be	1
ransacked	1
before	1
morning,"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
carpenter	1
to	1
Francisco,	1
who	1
was	1
at	1
his	1
house	1
giving	1
him	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
their	1
flight.	1
Francisco	1
immediately	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
count's	1
house	1
in	1
warn	1
him	1
of	1
his	1
danger.	1
The	1
first	1
person	1
he	1
saw	1
was	1
Arthur,	1
who,	1
with	1
a	1
face	1
of	1
terror,	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
"Do	1
you	1
know	1
what	1
has	1
happened?	1
It	1
is	1
all	1
over	1
with	1
Resina!"	1
"All	1
over	1
with	1
Resina!	1
What,	1
has	1
there	1
been	1
a	1
fresh	1
eruption?	1
Has	1
the	1
lava	1
reached	1
Resina?"	1
"No;	1
but	1
it	1
will	1
inevitably	1
be	1
blown	1
up.	1
There,"	1
said	1
Arthur,	1
pointing	1
to	1
a	1
thin	1
figure	1
of	1
an	1
Italian,	1
who	1
stood	1
pale	1
and	1
trembling,	1
and	1
looking	1
up	1
to	1
heaven	1
as	1
he	1
crossed	1
himself	1
repeatedly.	1
"There,"	1
said	1
Arthur,	1
"is	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
has	1
left	1
a	1
parcel	1
of	1
his	1
cursed	1
rockets	1
and	1
fireworks,	1
with	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
how	1
much	1
gunpowder,	1
in	1
the	1
count's	1
house,	1
from	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
just	1
fled.	1
The	1
wind	1
blows	1
that	1
way.	1
One	1
spark	1
of	1
fire,	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
is	1
blown	1
up."	1
Francisco	1
waited	1
not	1
to	1
hear	1
more;	1
but	1
instantly,	1
without	1
explaining	1
his	1
intentions	1
to	1
anyone,	1
set	1
out	1
for	1
the	1
count's	1
villa,	1
and,	1
with	1
a	1
bucket	1
of	1
water	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
crossed	1
the	1
beds	1
of	1
lava	1
with	1
which	1
the	1
house	1
was	1
encompassed;	1
when,	1
reaching	1
the	1
hall	1
where	1
the	1
rockets	1
and	1
gunpowder	1
were	1
left,	1
he	1
plunged	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
water,	1
and	1
returned	1
with	1
them	1
in	1
safety	1
over	1
the	1
lava,	1
yet	1
warm	1
under	1
his	1
feet.	1
What	1
was	1
the	1
surprise	1
and	1
joy	1
of	1
the	1
poor	1
firework-maker	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
Francisco	1
return	1
from	1
this	1
dangerous	1
expedition!	1
He	1
could	1
scarcely	1
believe	1
his	1
eyes,	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
rockets	1
and	1
the	1
gunpowder	1
all	1
safe.	1
The	1
count,	1
who	1
had	1
given	1
up	1
the	1
hopes	1
of	1
saving	1
his	1
palace,	1
was	1
in	1
admiration	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
of	1
this	1
instance	1
of	1
intrepidity,	1
which	1
properly	1
saved	1
not	1
only	1
his	1
villa,	1
but	1
the	1
whole	1
village	1
of	1
Resina,	1
from	1
destruction.	1
These	1
fireworks	1
had	1
been	1
prepared	1
for	1
the	1
celebration	1
of	1
the	1
countess'	1
birthday,	1
and	1
were	1
forgotten	1
in	1
the	1
hurry	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
on	1
which	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
fled	1
from	1
Torre	1
del	1
Greco.	1
"Brave	1
young	1
man!"	1
said	1
the	1
count	1
to	1
Francisco,	1
"I	1
thank	1
you,	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
limit	1
my	1
gratitude	1
to	1
thanks.	1
You	1
tell	1
me	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
danger	1
of	1
my	1
villa	1
being	1
pillaged	1
by	1
robbers.	1
It	1
is	1
from	1
this	1
moment	1
your	1
interest,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
mine,	1
to	1
prevent	1
their	1
depredations;	1
for	1
(trust	1
to	1
my	1
liberality)	1
a	1
portion	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
saved	1
of	1
mine	1
shall	1
be	1
yours."	1
"Bravo!	1
bravissimo!"	1
exclaimed	1
one,	1
who	1
started	1
from	1
a	1
recessed	1
window	1
in	1
the	1
hall	1
where	1
all	1
this	1
passed.	1
"Bravo!	1
bravissimo!"--Francisco	1
thought	1
he	1
knew	1
the	1
voice	1
and	1
the	1
countenance	1
of	1
this	1
man,	1
who	1
exclaimed	1
with	1
so	1
much	1
enthusiasm.	1
He	1
remembered	1
to	1
have	1
seen	1
him	1
before,	1
but	1
when,	1
or	1
where,	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
recollect.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
count	1
left	1
the	1
hall,	1
the	1
stranger	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
Francisco.	1
"Is	1
it	1
possible,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"that	1
you	1
don't	1
know	1
me?	1
It	1
is	1
scarcely	1
a	1
twelvemonth	1
since	1
I	1
drew	1
tears	1
from	1
your	1
eyes."	1
"Tears	1
from	1
my	1
eyes?"	1
repeated	1
Francisco,	1
smiling;	1
"I	1
have	1
shed	1
but	1
few	1
tears.	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
but	1
few	1
misfortunes	1
in	1
my	1
life."	1
The	1
stranger	1
answered	1
him	1
by	1
two	1
extempore	1
Italian	1
lines,	1
which	1
conveyed	1
nearly	1
the	1
same	1
idea	1
that	1
has	1
been	1
so	1
well	1
expressed	1
by	1
an	1
English	1
poet:--	1
"To	1
each	1
their	1
sufferings--all	1
are	1
men	1
Condemn'd	1
alike	1
to	1
groan;	1
The	1
feeling	1
for	1
another's	1
woes,	1
Th'	1
unfeeling	1
for	1
his	1
own."	1
"I	1
know	1
you	1
now	1
perfectly	1
well,"	1
cried	1
Francisco;	1
"you	1
are	1
the	1
Improvisatore	1
who,	1
one	1
fine	1
moonlight	1
night	1
last	1
summer,	1
told	1
us	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
Cornaro	1
the	1
Turk."	1
"The	1
same,"	1
said	1
the	1
Improvisatore;	1
"the	1
same,	1
though	1
in	1
a	1
better	1
dress,	1
which	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
thought	1
would	1
have	1
made	1
so	1
much	1
difference	1
in	1
your	1
eyes,	1
though	1
it	1
makes	1
all	1
the	1
difference	1
between	1
man	1
and	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
stupid	1
vulgar.	1
My	1
genius	1
has	1
broken	1
through	1
the	1
clouds	1
of	1
misfortune	1
of	1
late.	1
A	1
few	1
happy	1
impromptu	1
verses	1
I	1
made	1
on	1
the	1
Count	1
de	1
Flora's	1
fall	1
from	1
his	1
horse	1
attracted	1
attention.	1
The	1
count	1
patronizes	1
me.	1
I	1
am	1
here	1
now	1
to	1
learn	1
the	1
fate	1
of	1
an	1
ode	1
I	1
have	1
just	1
composed	1
for	1
his	1
lady's	1
birthday.	1
My	1
ode	1
was	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
set	1
to	1
music,	1
and	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
performed	1
at	1
his	1
villa	1
near	1
Torre	1
del	1
Greco,	1
if	1
these	1
troubles	1
had	1
not	1
intervened.	1
Now	1
that	1
the	1
mountain	1
is	1
quiet	1
again,	1
people	1
will	1
return	1
to	1
their	1
senses.	1
I	1
expect	1
to	1
be	1
munificently	1
rewarded.	1
But,	1
perhaps,	1
I	1
detain	1
you.	1
Go;	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
forget	1
to	1
celebrate	1
the	1
heroic	1
action	1
you	1
have	1
performed	1
this	1
day.	1
I	1
still	1
amuse	1
myself	1
amongst	1
the	1
populace	1
in	1
my	1
tattered	1
garb	1
late	1
in	1
the	1
evenings,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
sound	1
your	1
praises	1
through	1
Naples	1
in	1
a	1
poem	1
I	1
mean	1
to	1
recite	1
on	1
the	1
late	1
eruption	1
of	1
Mount	1
Vesuvius.	1
Adieu."	1
The	1
Improvisatore	1
was	1
as	1
good	1
as	1
his	1
word.	1
That	1
evening,	1
with	1
more	1
than	1
his	1
usual	1
enthusiasm,	1
he	1
recited	1
his	1
verses	1
to	1
a	1
great	1
crowd	1
of	1
people	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
public	1
squares.	1
Amongst	1
the	1
crowd	1
were	1
several	1
to	1
whom	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Francisco	1
was	1
well	1
known,	1
and	1
by	1
whom	1
he	1
was	1
well	1
beloved.	1
These	1
were	1
his	1
young	1
companions,	1
who	1
remembered	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
fruit-seller	1
amongst	1
the	1
little	1
merchants.	1
They	1
rejoiced	1
to	1
hear	1
his	1
praises,	1
and	1
repeated	1
the	1
lines	1
with	1
shouts	1
of	1
applause.	1
"Let	1
us	1
pass.	1
What	1
is	1
all	1
this	1
disturbance	1
in	1
the	1
streets?"	1
said	1
a	1
man,	1
pushing	1
his	1
way	1
through	1
the	1
crowd.	1
A	1
lad	1
who	1
held	1
by	1
his	1
arm	1
stopped	1
suddenly	1
on	1
hearing	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Francisco,	1
which	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
repeating	1
with	1
so	1
much	1
enthusiasm.	1
"Ha!	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
at	1
last	1
a	1
story	1
that	1
interests	1
you	1
more	1
than	1
that	1
of	1
Cornaro	1
the	1
Turk,"	1
cried	1
the	1
Improvisatore,	1
looking	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
youth,	1
who	1
had	1
stopped	1
so	1
suddenly.	1
"You	1
are	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
who,	1
last	1
summer,	1
had	1
liked	1
to	1
have	1
tricked	1
me	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
new	1
hat.	1
Promise	1
me	1
you	1
won't	1
touch	1
it	1
now,"	1
said	1
he,	1
throwing	1
down	1
the	1
hat	1
at	1
his	1
feet,	1
"or	1
you	1
hear	1
not	1
one	1
word	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
say.	1
Not	1
one	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
heroic	1
action	1
performed	1
at	1
the	1
villa	1
of	1
the	1
Count	1
de	1
Flora,	1
near	1
Torre	1
del	1
Greco,	1
this	1
morning,	1
by	1
Signor	1
Francisco."	1
"SIGNOR	1
Francisco!"	1
repeated	1
the	1
lad	1
with	1
disdain.	1
"Well,	1
let	1
us	1
hear	1
what	1
you	1
have	1
to	1
tell	1
of	1
him,"	1
added	1
he.	1
"Your	1
hat	1
is	1
very	1
safe,	1
I	1
promise	1
you;	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
touch	1
it.	1
What	1
of	1
SIGNOR	1
Francisco?"	1
"SIGNOR	1
Francisco	1
I	1
may,	1
without	1
impropriety,	1
call	1
him,"	1
said	1
the	1
Improvisatore,	1
"for	1
he	1
is	1
likely	1
to	1
become	1
rich	1
enough	1
to	1
command	1
the	1
title	1
from	1
those	1
who	1
might	1
not	1
otherwise	1
respect	1
his	1
merit."	1
"Likely	1
to	1
become	1
rich!	1
how?"	1
said	1
the	1
lad,	1
whom	1
our	1
readers	1
have	1
probably	1
before	1
this	1
time	1
discovered	1
to	1
be	1
Piedro.	1
"How,	1
pray,	1
is	1
he	1
likely	1
to	1
become	1
rich	1
enough	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
signor?"	1
"The	1
Count	1
de	1
Flora	1
has	1
promised	1
him	1
a	1
liberal	1
portion	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
fine	1
furniture,	1
plate	1
and	1
jewels	1
that	1
can	1
be	1
saved	1
from	1
his	1
villa	1
at	1
Torre	1
del	1
Greco.	1
Francisco	1
is	1
gone	1
down	1
hither	1
now	1
with	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
count's	1
domestics	1
to	1
protect	1
the	1
valuable	1
goods	1
against	1
those	1
villainous	1
plunderers,	1
who	1
robbed	1
their	1
fellow-creatures	1
of	1
what	1
even	1
the	1
flames	1
of	1
Vesuvius	1
would	1
spare."	1
"Come,	1
we	1
have	1
had	1
enough	1
of	1
this	1
stuff,"	1
cried	1
the	1
man	1
whose	1
arm	1
Piedro	1
held.	1
"Come	1
away,"	1
and	1
he	1
hurried	1
forwards.	1
This	1
man	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
villains	1
against	1
whom	1
the	1
honest	1
orator	1
expressed	1
such	1
indignation.	1
He	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
with	1
whom	1
Piedro	1
got	1
acquainted	1
during	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
living	1
extravagantly	1
upon	1
the	1
money	1
he	1
gained	1
by	1
the	1
sale	1
of	1
the	1
stolen	1
diamond	1
cross.	1
That	1
robbery	1
was	1
not	1
discovered;	1
and	1
his	1
success,	1
as	1
he	1
called	1
it,	1
hardened	1
him	1
in	1
guilt.	1
He	1
was	1
both	1
unwilling	1
and	1
unable	1
to	1
withdraw	1
himself	1
from	1
the	1
bad	1
company	1
with	1
whom	1
his	1
ill	1
gotten	1
wealth	1
connected	1
him.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
consider	1
that	1
bad	1
company	1
leads	1
to	1
the	1
gallows.	1
*	1
*	1
La	1
mala	1
compagnia	1
e	1
quella	1
che	1
mena	1
uomini	1
a	1
la	1
forca.	1
The	1
universal	1
confusion	1
which	1
followed	1
the	1
eruption	1
of	1
Mount	1
Vesuvius	1
was	1
to	1
these	1
villains	1
a	1
time	1
of	1
rejoicing.	1
No	1
sooner	1
did	1
Piedro's	1
companion	1
hear	1
of	1
the	1
rich	1
furniture,	1
plate,	1
etc.,	1
which	1
the	1
imprudent	1
orator	1
had	1
described	1
as	1
belonging	1
to	1
the	1
Count	1
de	1
Flora's	1
villa,	1
than	1
he	1
longed	1
to	1
make	1
himself	1
master	1
of	1
the	1
whole.	1
"It	1
is	1
a	1
pity,"	1
said	1
Piedro,	1
"that	1
the	1
count	1
has	1
sent	1
Francisco,	1
with	1
his	1
servants	1
down	1
to	1
guard	1
it."	1
"And	1
who	1
is	1
this	1
Francisco	1
of	1
whom	1
you	1
seem	1
to	1
stand	1
in	1
so	1
much	1
awe?"	1
"A	1
boy,	1
a	1
young	1
lad	1
only,	1
of	1
about	1
my	1
own	1
age;	1
but	1
I	1
know	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
sturdily	1
honest.	1
The	1
servants	1
we	1
might	1
corrupt;	1
but	1
even	1
the	1
old	1
proverb	1
of	1
'Angle	1
with	1
a	1
silver	1
hook,'	1
*	1
won't	1
hold	1
good	1
with	1
him."	1
*	1
Pescar	1
col	1
hamo	1
d'argento.	1
"And	1
if	1
he	1
cannot	1
be	1
won	1
by	1
fair	1
means,	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
conquered	1
by	1
foul,"	1
said	1
the	1
desperate	1
villain;	1
"but	1
if	1
we	1
offer	1
him	1
rather	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
count	1
has	1
already	1
promised	1
for	1
his	1
share	1
of	1
the	1
booty,	1
of	1
course	1
he	1
will	1
consult	1
at	1
once	1
his	1
safety	1
and	1
his	1
interest."	1
"No,"	1
said	1
Piedro;	1
"that	1
is	1
not	1
his	1
nature.	1
I	1
know	1
him	1
from	1
a	1
child,	1
and	1
we	1
had	1
better	1
think	1
of	1
some	1
other	1
house	1
for	1
to-night's	1
business."	1
"None	1
other;	1
none	1
but	1
this,"	1
cried	1
his	1
companion,	1
with	1
an	1
oath.	1
"My	1
mind	1
is	1
determined	1
upon	1
this,	1
and	1
you	1
must	1
obey	1
your	1
leader:	1
recollect	1
the	1
fate	1
of	1
him	1
who	1
failed	1
me	1
yesterday."	1
The	1
person	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
alluded	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
gang	1
of	1
robbers	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
assassinated	1
by	1
his	1
companions	1
for	1
hesitating	1
to	1
commit	1
some	1
crime	1
suggested	1
by	1
their	1
leader.	1
No	1
tyranny	1
is	1
so	1
dreadful	1
as	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
exercised	1
by	1
villains	1
over	1
their	1
young	1
accomplices,	1
who	1
become	1
their	1
slaves.	1
Piedro,	1
who	1
was	1
of	1
a	1
cowardly	1
nature,	1
trembled	1
at	1
the	1
threatening	1
countenance	1
of	1
his	1
captain,	1
and	1
promised	1
submission.	1
In	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
the	1
morning,	1
inquiries	1
were	1
made	1
secretly	1
amongst	1
the	1
count's	1
servants;	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
men	1
who	1
were	1
engaged	1
to	1
sit	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
villa	1
that	1
night	1
along	1
with	1
Francisco,	1
were	1
bribed	1
to	1
second	1
the	1
views	1
of	1
this	1
gang	1
of	1
thieves.	1
It	1
was	1
agreed	1
that	1
about	1
midnight	1
the	1
robbers	1
should	1
be	1
let	1
into	1
the	1
house;	1
that	1
Francisco	1
should	1
be	1
tied	1
hand	1
and	1
foot,	1
whilst	1
they	1
carried	1
off	1
their	1
booty.	1
"He	1
is	1
a	1
stubborn	1
chap,	1
though	1
so	1
young,	1
I	1
understand,"	1
said	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
robbers	1
to	1
his	1
men;	1
"but	1
we	1
carry	1
poniards,	1
and	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
use	1
them.	1
Piedro,	1
you	1
look	1
pale.	1
You	1
don't	1
require	1
to	1
be	1
reminded	1
of	1
what	1
I	1
said	1
to	1
you	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
alone	1
just	1
now?"	1
Piedro's	1
voice	1
failed,	1
and	1
some	1
of	1
his	1
comrades	1
observed	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
young	1
and	1
new	1
to	1
the	1
business.	1
The	1
captain,	1
who,	1
from	1
being	1
his	1
pretended	1
friend	1
during	1
his	1
wealthy	1
days,	1
had	1
of	1
late	1
become	1
his	1
tyrant,	1
cast	1
a	1
stern	1
look	1
at	1
Piedro,	1
and	1
bid	1
him	1
be	1
sure	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
the	1
old	1
Jew's,	1
which	1
was	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
meeting,	1
in	1
the	1
dusk	1
of	1
the	1
evening.	1
After	1
saying	1
this	1
he	1
departed.	1
Piedro,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
alone,	1
tried	1
to	1
collect	1
his	1
thoughts--all	1
his	1
thoughts	1
were	1
full	1
of	1
horror.	1
"Where	1
am	1
I?"	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
himself;	1
"what	1
am	1
I	1
about?	1
Did	1
I	1
understand	1
rightly	1
what	1
he	1
said	1
about	1
poniards?	1
Francisco;	1
oh,	1
Francisco!	1
Excellent,	1
kind,	1
generous	1
Francisco!	1
Yes,	1
I	1
recollect	1
your	1
look	1
when	1
you	1
held	1
the	1
bunch	1
of	1
grapes	1
to	1
my	1
lips,	1
as	1
I	1
sat	1
by	1
the	1
sea-shore	1
deserted	1
by	1
all	1
the	1
world;	1
and	1
now,	1
what	1
friends	1
have	1
I.	1
Robbers	1
and--"	1
The	1
word	1
MURDERERS	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
utter.	1
He	1
again	1
recollected	1
what	1
had	1
been	1
said	1
about	1
poniards,	1
and	1
the	1
longer	1
his	1
mind	1
fixed	1
upon	1
the	1
words,	1
and	1
the	1
look	1
that	1
accompanied	1
them,	1
the	1
more	1
he	1
was	1
shocked.	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
doubt	1
but	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
serious	1
intention	1
of	1
his	1
accomplices	1
to	1
murder	1
Francisco,	1
if	1
he	1
should	1
make	1
any	1
resistance.	1
Piedro	1
had	1
at	1
this	1
moment	1
no	1
friend	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
could	1
apply	1
for	1
advice	1
or	1
assistance.	1
His	1
wretched	1
father	1
died	1
some	1
weeks	1
before	1
this	1
time,	1
in	1
a	1
fit	1
of	1
intoxication.	1
Piedro	1
walked	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
street,	1
scarcely	1
capable	1
of	1
thinking,	1
much	1
less	1
of	1
coming	1
to	1
any	1
rational	1
resolution.	1
The	1
hours	1
passed	1
away,	1
the	1
shadows	1
of	1
the	1
houses	1
lengthened	1
under	1
his	1
footsteps,	1
the	1
evening	1
came	1
on,	1
and	1
when	1
it	1
grew	1
dusk,	1
after	1
hesitating	1
in	1
great	1
agony	1
of	1
mind	1
for	1
some	1
time,	1
his	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
robbers'	1
vengeance	1
prevailed	1
over	1
every	1
other	1
feeling,	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
at	1
the	1
appointed	1
hour	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
meeting.	1
The	1
place	1
of	1
meeting	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
that	1
Jew	1
to	1
whom	1
he,	1
several	1
months	1
before,	1
sold	1
the	1
diamond	1
cross.	1
That	1
cross	1
which	1
he	1
thought	1
himself	1
so	1
lucky	1
to	1
have	1
stolen,	1
and	1
to	1
have	1
disposed	1
of	1
undetected,	1
was,	1
in	1
fact,	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
his	1
being	1
in	1
his	1
present	1
dreadful	1
situation.	1
It	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
Jew's	1
that	1
he	1
connected	1
himself	1
with	1
this	1
gang	1
of	1
robbers,	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
was	1
now	1
become	1
an	1
absolute	1
slave.	1
"Oh,	1
that	1
I	1
dared	1
to	1
disobey!"	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
himself,	1
with	1
a	1
deep	1
sigh,	1
as	1
he	1
knocked	1
softly	1
at	1
the	1
back	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
Jew's	1
house.	1
The	1
back	1
door	1
opened	1
into	1
a	1
narrow,	1
unfrequented	1
street,	1
and	1
some	1
small	1
rooms	1
at	1
this	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
were	1
set	1
apart	1
for	1
the	1
reception	1
of	1
guests	1
who	1
desired	1
to	1
have	1
their	1
business	1
kept	1
secret.	1
These	1
rooms	1
were	1
separated	1
by	1
a	1
dark	1
passage	1
from	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
numbers	1
of	1
people	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
shop	1
in	1
the	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
which	1
looked	1
into	1
a	1
creditable	1
street,	1
without	1
knowing	1
anything	1
more,	1
from	1
the	1
ostensible	1
appearance	1
of	1
the	1
shop,	1
than	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
pawnbroker's,	1
where	1
old	1
clothes,	1
old	1
iron,	1
and	1
all	1
sorts	1
of	1
refuse	1
goods,	1
might	1
be	1
disposed	1
of	1
conveniently.	1
At	1
the	1
moment	1
Piedro	1
knocked	1
at	1
the	1
back	1
door,	1
the	1
front	1
shop	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
customers;	1
and	1
the	1
Jew's	1
boy,	1
whose	1
office	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
attend	1
to	1
these	1
signals,	1
let	1
Piedro	1
in,	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
none	1
of	1
his	1
comrades	1
were	1
yet	1
come,	1
and	1
left	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
room	1
by	1
himself.	1
He	1
was	1
pale	1
and	1
trembling,	1
and	1
felt	1
a	1
cold	1
dew	1
spread	1
over	1
him.	1
He	1
had	1
a	1
leaden	1
image	1
of	1
Saint	1
Januarius	1
tied	1
round	1
his	1
neck,	1
which,	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
his	1
wickedness,	1
he	1
superstitiously	1
preserved	1
as	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
charm,	1
and	1
on	1
this	1
he	1
kept	1
his	1
eyes	1
stupidly	1
fixed,	1
as	1
he	1
sat	1
alone	1
in	1
this	1
gloomy	1
place.	1
He	1
listened	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time,	1
but	1
he	1
heard	1
no	1
noise	1
at	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
where	1
he	1
was.	1
His	1
accomplices	1
did	1
not	1
arrive,	1
and,	1
in	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
impatient	1
terror,	1
the	1
attendant	1
upon	1
an	1
evil	1
conscience,	1
he	1
flung	1
open	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
his	1
cell,	1
and	1
groped	1
his	1
way	1
through	1
the	1
passage	1
which	1
he	1
knew	1
led	1
to	1
the	1
public	1
shop.	1
He	1
longed	1
to	1
hear	1
some	1
noise,	1
and	1
to	1
mix	1
with	1
the	1
living.	1
The	1
Jew,	1
when	1
Piedro	1
entered	1
the	1
shop,	1
was	1
bargaining	1
with	1
a	1
poor,	1
thin-looking	1
man	1
about	1
some	1
gunpowder.	1
"I	1
don't	1
deny	1
that	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
wet,"	1
said	1
the	1
man,	1
"but	1
since	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
bucket	1
of	1
water,	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
carefully	1
dried.	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
the	1
simple	1
truth,	1
that	1
so	1
soon	1
after	1
the	1
grand	1
eruption	1
of	1
Mount	1
Vesuvius,	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Naples	1
will	1
not	1
relish	1
fireworks.	1
My	1
poor	1
little	1
rockets,	1
and	1
even	1
my	1
Catherine-wheels,	1
will	1
have	1
no	1
effect.	1
I	1
am	1
glad	1
to	1
part	1
with	1
all	1
I	1
have	1
in	1
this	1
line	1
of	1
business.	1
A	1
few	1
days	1
ago	1
I	1
had	1
fine	1
things	1
in	1
readiness	1
for	1
the	1
Countess	1
de	1
Flora's	1
birthday,	1
which	1
was	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
celebrated	1
at	1
the	1
count's	1
villa."	1
"Why	1
do	1
you	1
fix	1
your	1
eyes	1
on	1
me,	1
friend?	1
What	1
is	1
your	1
discourse	1
to	1
me?"	1
said	1
Piedro,	1
who	1
imagined	1
that	1
the	1
man	1
fixed	1
his	1
eyes	1
upon	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
mentioned	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
count's	1
villa.	1
"I	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
fixed	1
my	1
eyes	1
upon	1
you;	1
I	1
was	1
thinking	1
of	1
my	1
fireworks,"	1
said	1
the	1
poor	1
man,	1
simply.	1
"But	1
now	1
that	1
I	1
do	1
look	1
at	1
you	1
and	1
hear	1
your	1
voice,	1
I	1
recollect	1
having	1
had	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
seeing	1
you	1
before."	1
"When?	1
where?"	1
said	1
Piedro.	1
"A	1
great	1
while	1
ago;	1
no	1
wonder	1
you	1
have	1
forgotten	1
me,"	1
said	1
the	1
man;	1
"but	1
I	1
can	1
recall	1
the	1
night	1
to	1
your	1
recollection.	1
You	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
street	1
with	1
me	1
the	1
night	1
I	1
let	1
off	1
that	1
unlucky	1
rocket,	1
which	1
frightened	1
the	1
horses,	1
and	1
was	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
overturning	1
a	1
lady's	1
coach.	1
Don't	1
you	1
remember	1
the	1
circumstance?"	1
"I	1
have	1
a	1
confused	1
recollection	1
of	1
some	1
such	1
thing,"	1
said	1
Piedro,	1
in	1
great	1
embarrassment;	1
and	1
he	1
looked	1
suspiciously	1
at	1
this	1
man,	1
in	1
doubt	1
whether	1
he	1
was	1
cunning,	1
and	1
wanted	1
to	1
sound	1
him,	1
or	1
whether	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
simple	1
as	1
he	1
appeared.	1
"You	1
did	1
not,	1
perhaps,	1
hear,	1
then,"	1
continued	1
the	1
man,	1
"that	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
search	1
made,	1
after	1
the	1
overturn,	1
for	1
a	1
fine	1
diamond	1
cross,	1
belonging	1
to	1
the	1
lady	1
in	1
the	1
carriage?	1
That	1
lady,	1
though	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
it	1
till	1
lately,	1
was	1
the	1
Countess	1
de	1
Flora."	1
"I	1
know	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
matter,"	1
interrupted	1
Piedro,	1
in	1
great	1
agitation.	1
His	1
confusion	1
was	1
so	1
marked,	1
that	1
the	1
firework-maker	1
could	1
not	1
avoid	1
taking	1
notice	1
of	1
it;	1
and	1
a	1
silence	1
of	1
some	1
moments	1
ensued.	1
The	1
Jew,	1
more	1
practised	1
in	1
dissimulation	1
than	1
Piedro,	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
turn	1
the	1
man's	1
attention	1
back	1
to	1
his	1
rockets	1
and	1
his	1
gunpowder--agreed	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
gunpowder--paid	1
for	1
it	1
in	1
haste,	1
and	1
was,	1
though	1
apparently	1
unconcerned,	1
eager	1
to	1
get	1
rid	1
of	1
him.	1
But	1
this	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
easily	1
done.	1
The	1
man's	1
curiosity	1
was	1
excited,	1
and	1
his	1
suspicions	1
of	1
Piedro	1
were	1
increased	1
every	1
moment	1
by	1
all	1
the	1
dark	1
changes	1
of	1
his	1
countenance.	1
Piedro,	1
overpowered	1
with	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
guilt,	1
surprised	1
at	1
the	1
unexpected	1
mention	1
of	1
the	1
diamond	1
cross,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Count	1
de	1
Flora's	1
villa,	1
stood	1
like	1
one	1
convicted,	1
and	1
seemed	1
fixed	1
to	1
the	1
spot,	1
without	1
power	1
of	1
motion.	1
"I	1
want	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
old	1
cambric	1
that	1
you	1
said	1
you	1
had--that	1
would	1
do	1
for	1
making--that	1
you	1
could	1
let	1
me	1
have	1
cheap	1
for	1
artificial	1
flowers,"	1
said	1
the	1
firework-maker	1
to	1
the	1
Jew;	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
spoke,	1
his	1
eye	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time	1
looked	1
towards	1
Piedro.	1
Piedro	1
felt	1
for	1
the	1
leaden	1
image	1
of	1
the	1
saint,	1
which	1
he	1
wore	1
round	1
his	1
neck.	1
The	1
string	1
which	1
held	1
it	1
cracked,	1
and	1
broke	1
with	1
the	1
pull	1
he	1
gave	1
it.	1
This	1
slight	1
circumstance	1
affected	1
his	1
terrified	1
and	1
superstitious	1
mind	1
more	1
than	1
all	1
the	1
rest.	1
He	1
imagined	1
that	1
at	1
this	1
moment	1
his	1
fate	1
was	1
decided;	1
that	1
Saint	1
Januarius	1
deserted	1
him,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
undone.	1
He	1
precipitately	1
followed	1
the	1
firework-man	1
the	1
instant	1
he	1
left	1
the	1
shop,	1
and	1
seizing	1
hold	1
of	1
his	1
arm,	1
whispered,	1
"I	1
must	1
speak	1
to	1
you."	1
"Speak,	1
then,"	1
said	1
the	1
man,	1
astonished.	1
"Not	1
here;	1
this	1
way,"	1
said	1
he,	1
drawing	1
him	1
towards	1
the	1
dark	1
passage:	1
"what	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
say	1
must	1
not	1
be	1
overheard.	1
You	1
are	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
Count	1
de	1
Flora's,	1
are	1
not	1
you?"	1
"I	1
am,"	1
said	1
the	1
man.	1
He	1
was	1
going	1
there	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
the	1
countess	1
about	1
some	1
artificial	1
flowers;	1
but	1
Piedro	1
thought	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
her	1
about	1
the	1
diamond	1
cross.	1
"You	1
are	1
going	1
to	1
give	1
information	1
against	1
me?	1
Nay,	1
hear	1
me,	1
I	1
confess	1
that	1
I	1
purloined	1
that	1
diamond	1
cross;	1
but	1
I	1
can	1
do	1
the	1
count	1
a	1
great	1
service,	1
upon	1
condition	1
that	1
he	1
pardons	1
me.	1
His	1
villa	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
attacked	1
this	1
night	1
by	1
four	1
well	1
armed	1
men.	1
They	1
will	1
set	1
out	1
five	1
hours	1
hence.	1
I	1
am	1
compelled,	1
under	1
the	1
threat	1
of	1
assassination,	1
to	1
accompany	1
them;	1
but	1
I	1
shall	1
do	1
no	1
more.	1
I	1
throw	1
myself	1
upon	1
the	1
count's	1
mercy.	1
Hasten	1
to	1
him--we	1
have	1
no	1
time	1
to	1
lose."	1
The	1
poor	1
man,	1
who	1
heard	1
this	1
confession,	1
escaped	1
from	1
Piedro	1
the	1
moment	1
he	1
loosed	1
his	1
arm.	1
With	1
all	1
possible	1
expedition	1
he	1
ran	1
to	1
the	1
count's	1
palace	1
in	1
Naples,	1
and	1
related	1
to	1
him	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
said	1
by	1
Piedro.	1
Some	1
of	1
the	1
count's	1
servants,	1
on	1
whom	1
he	1
could	1
most	1
depend,	1
were	1
at	1
a	1
distant	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
attending	1
their	1
mistress,	1
but	1
the	1
English	1
gentleman	1
offered	1
the	1
services	1
of	1
his	1
man	1
Arthur.	1
Arthur	1
no	1
sooner	1
heard	1
the	1
business,	1
and	1
understood	1
that	1
Francisco	1
was	1
in	1
danger,	1
than	1
he	1
armed	1
himself	1
without	1
saying	1
one	1
word,	1
saddled	1
his	1
English	1
horse,	1
and	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
depart	1
before	1
anyone	1
else	1
had	1
finished	1
their	1
exclamations	1
and	1
conjectures.	1
"But	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
to	1
set	1
out	1
yet,"	1
said	1
the	1
servant;	1
"it	1
is	1
but	1
four	1
miles	1
to	1
Torre	1
del	1
Greco;	1
the	1
sbirri	1
(officers	1
of	1
justice)	1
are	1
summoned--they	1
are	1
to	1
go	1
with	1
us--we	1
must	1
wait	1
for	1
them."	1
They	1
waited,	1
much	1
against	1
Arthur's	1
inclination,	1
a	1
considerable	1
time	1
for	1
these	1
sbirri.	1
At	1
length	1
they	1
set	1
out,	1
and	1
just	1
as	1
they	1
reached	1
the	1
villa,	1
the	1
flash	1
of	1
the	1
pistol	1
was	1
seen	1
from	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
apartments	1
in	1
the	1
house.	1
The	1
robbers	1
were	1
there.	1
This	1
pistol	1
was	1
snapped	1
by	1
their	1
captain	1
at	1
poor	1
Francisco,	1
who	1
had	1
bravely	1
asserted	1
that	1
he	1
would,	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
life,	1
defend	1
the	1
property	1
committed	1
to	1
his	1
care.	1
The	1
pistol	1
missed	1
fire,	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
charged	1
with	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
damaged	1
powder	1
which	1
the	1
Jew	1
had	1
bought	1
that	1
evening	1
from	1
the	1
firework	1
maker,	1
and	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
sold	1
as	1
excellent	1
immediately	1
afterwards	1
to	1
his	1
favourite	1
customers--the	1
robbers	1
who	1
met	1
at	1
his	1
house.	1
Arthur,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
perceived	1
the	1
flash	1
of	1
the	1
piece,	1
pressed	1
forward	1
through	1
all	1
the	1
apartments,	1
followed	1
by	1
the	1
count's	1
servants	1
and	1
the	1
officers	1
of	1
justice.	1
At	1
the	1
sudden	1
appearance	1
of	1
so	1
many	1
armed	1
men,	1
the	1
robbers	1
stood	1
dismayed.	1
Arthur	1
eagerly	1
shook	1
Francisco's	1
hand,	1
congratulating	1
him	1
upon	1
his	1
safety,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
perceive,	1
till	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
him	1
several	1
rough	1
friendly	1
shakes,	1
that	1
his	1
arm	1
was	1
wounded,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
pale	1
with	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
blood.	1
"It	1
is	1
not	1
much--only	1
a	1
slight	1
wound,"	1
said	1
Francisco;	1
"one	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
escaped,	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
been	1
upon	1
my	1
guard;	1
but	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
a	1
face	1
that	1
I	1
little	1
expected	1
to	1
see	1
in	1
such	1
company	1
took	1
from	1
me	1
all	1
presence	1
of	1
mind;	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
ruffians	1
stabbed	1
me	1
here	1
in	1
the	1
arm,	1
whilst	1
I	1
stood	1
in	1
stupid	1
astonishment."	1
"Oh!	1
take	1
me	1
to	1
prison!	1
take	1
me	1
to	1
prison--I	1
am	1
weary	1
of	1
life--I	1
am	1
a	1
wretch	1
not	1
fit	1
to	1
live!"	1
cried	1
Piedro,	1
holding	1
his	1
hands	1
to	1
be	1
tied	1
by	1
the	1
sbirri.	1
The	1
next	1
morning	1
Piedro	1
was	1
conveyed	1
to	1
prison;	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
passed	1
through	1
the	1
streets	1
of	1
Naples	1
he	1
was	1
met	1
by	1
several	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
known	1
him	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
child.	1
"Ay,"	1
said	1
they,	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
by,	1
"his	1
father	1
encouraged	1
him	1
in	1
cheating	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
BUT	1
A	1
CHILD;	1
and	1
see	1
what	1
he	1
is	1
come	1
to,	1
now	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
man!"	1
He	1
was	1
ordered	1
to	1
remain	1
twelve	1
months	1
in	1
solitary	1
confinement.	1
His	1
captain	1
and	1
his	1
accomplices	1
were	1
sent	1
to	1
the	1
galleys,	1
and	1
the	1
Jew	1
was	1
banished	1
from	1
Naples.	1
And	1
now,	1
having	1
got	1
these	1
villains	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way,	1
let	1
us	1
return	1
to	1
honest	1
Francisco.	1
His	1
wound	1
was	1
soon	1
healed.	1
Arthur	1
was	1
no	1
bad	1
surgeon,	1
for	1
he	1
let	1
his	1
patient	1
get	1
well	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
he	1
pleased;	1
and	1
Carlo	1
and	1
Rosetta	1
nursed	1
him	1
with	1
so	1
much	1
kindness,	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
almost	1
sorry	1
to	1
find	1
himself	1
perfectly	1
recovered.	1
"Now	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
able	1
to	1
go	1
out,"	1
said	1
Francisco's	1
father	1
to	1
him,	1
"you	1
must	1
come	1
and	1
look	1
at	1
my	1
new	1
house,	1
my	1
dear	1
son."	1
"Your	1
new	1
house,	1
father?"	1
"Yes,	1
son,	1
and	1
a	1
charming	1
one	1
it	1
is,	1
and	1
a	1
handsome	1
piece	1
of	1
land	1
near	1
it--all	1
at	1
a	1
safe	1
distance,	1
too,	1
from	1
Mount	1
Vesuvius;	1
and	1
can	1
you	1
guess	1
how	1
I	1
came	1
by	1
it?--it	1
was	1
given	1
to	1
me	1
for	1
having	1
a	1
good	1
son."	1
"Yes,"	1
cried	1
Carlo;	1
"the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Resina,	1
and	1
several	1
who	1
had	1
property	1
near	1
Terre	1
del	1
Greco,	1
and	1
whose	1
houses	1
and	1
lives	1
were	1
saved	1
by	1
your	1
intrepidity	1
in	1
carrying	1
the	1
materials	1
for	1
the	1
fireworks	1
and	1
the	1
gunpowder	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
dangerous	1
place,	1
went	1
in	1
a	1
body	1
to	1
the	1
duke,	1
and	1
requested	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
mention	1
your	1
name	1
and	1
these	1
facts	1
to	1
the	1
king,	1
who,	1
amongst	1
the	1
grants	1
he	1
has	1
made	1
to	1
the	1
sufferers	1
by	1
the	1
late	1
eruption	1
of	1
Mount	1
Vesuvius,	1
has	1
been	1
pleased	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
he	1
gives	1
this	1
house	1
and	1
garden	1
to	1
your	1
father,	1
because	1
you	1
have	1
saved	1
the	1
property	1
and	1
lives	1
of	1
many	1
of	1
his	1
subjects."	1
The	1
value	1
of	1
a	1
handsome	1
portion	1
of	1
furniture,	1
plate,	1
etc.,	1
in	1
the	1
Count	1
de	1
Flora's	1
villa,	1
was,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
count's	1
promise,	1
given	1
to	1
him;	1
and	1
this	1
money	1
he	1
divided	1
between	1
his	1
own	1
family	1
and	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
good	1
carpenter	1
who	1
first	1
put	1
a	1
pencil	1
into	1
his	1
hands.	1
Arthur	1
would	1
not	1
accept	1
of	1
any	1
present	1
from	1
him.	1
To	1
Mr.	1
Lee,	1
the	1
English	1
gentleman,	1
he	1
offered	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
drawings--a	1
fruit-piece.	1
"I	1
like	1
this	1
very	1
well,"	1
said	1
Arthur,	1
as	1
he	1
examined	1
the	1
drawing,	1
"but	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
this	1
melon	1
better	1
if	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
bruised.	1
It	1
is	1
now	1
three	1
years	1
ago	1
since	1
I	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
buy	1
that	1
bruised	1
melon	1
from	1
you;	1
you	1
showed	1
me	1
your	1
honest	1
nature	1
then,	1
though	1
you	1
were	1
but	1
a	1
boy;	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
you	1
the	1
same	1
ever	1
since.	1
A	1
good	1
beginning	1
makes	1
a	1
good	1
ending--an	1
honest	1
boy	1
will	1
make	1
an	1
honest	1
man;	1
and	1
honesty	1
is	1
the	1
best	1
policy,	1
as	1
you	1
have	1
proved	1
to	1
all	1
who	1
wanted	1
the	1
proof,	1
I	1
hope."	1
"Yes,"	1
added	1
Francisco's	1
father,	1
"I	1
think	1
it	1
is	1
pretty	1
plain	1
that	1
Piedro	1
the	1
Cunning	1
has	1
not	1
managed	1
quite	1
so	1
well	1
as	1
Francisco	1
the	1
Honest."	1
TARLTON.	1
Delightful	1
task!	1
to	1
rear	1
the	1
tender	1
thought,--	1
To	1
teach	1
the	1
young	1
idea	1
how	1
to	1
shoot,--	1
To	1
pour	1
the	1
fresh	1
instruction	1
o'er	1
the	1
mind,--	1
To	1
breathe	1
th'	1
enlivening	1
spirit,--and	1
to	1
fix	1
The	1
generous	1

THOMSON.	1
Young	1
Hardy	1
was	1
educated	1
by	1
Mr.	1
Freeman,	1
a	1
very	1
excellent	1
master,	1
at	1
one	1
of	1
our	1
rural	1
Sunday	1
schools.	1
He	1
was	1
honest,	1
obedient,	1
active	1
and	1
good-	1
natured,	1
hence	1
he	1
was	1
esteemed	1
by	1
his	1
master;	1
and	1
being	1
beloved	1
by	1
all	1
his	1
companions	1
who	1
were	1
good,	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
desire	1
to	1
be	1
loved	1
by	1
the	1
bad;	1
nor	1
was	1
he	1
at	1
all	1
vexed	1
or	1
ashamed	1
when	1
idle,	1
mischievous	1
or	1
dishonest	1
boys	1
attempted	1
to	1
plague	1
or	1
ridicule	1
him.	1
His	1
friend	1
Loveit,	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
wished	1
to	1
be	1
universally	1
liked,	1
and	1
his	1
highest	1
ambition	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
thought	1
the	1
best	1
natured	1
boy	1
in	1
the	1
school--and	1
so	1
he	1
was.	1
He	1
usually	1
went	1
by	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
POOR	1
LOVEIT,	1
and	1
everybody	1
pitied	1
him	1
when	1
he	1
got	1
into	1
disgrace,	1
which	1
he	1
frequently	1
did,	1
for	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
good	1
disposition,	1
he	1
was	1
led	1
to	1
do	1
things	1
which	1
he	1
knew	1
to	1
be	1
wrong	1
merely	1
because	1
he	1
could	1
never	1
have	1
the	1
courage	1
to	1
say	1
"NO,"	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
afraid	1
to	1
offend	1
the	1
ill-natured,	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
bear	1
to	1
be	1
laughed	1
at	1
by	1
fools.	1
One	1
fine	1
autumn	1
evening,	1
all	1
the	1
boys	1
were	1
permitted	1
to	1
go	1
out	1
to	1
play	1
in	1
a	1
pleasant	1
green	1
meadow	1
near	1
the	1
school.	1
Loveit	1
and	1
another	1
boy,	1
called	1
Tarlton,	1
began	1
to	1
play	1
a	1
game	1
of	1
battledore	1
and	1
shuttlecock,	1
and	1
a	1
large	1
party	1
stood	1
by	1
to	1
look	1
on,	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
the	1
best	1
players	1
at	1
battledore	1
and	1
shuttlecock	1
in	1
the	1
school,	1
and	1
this	1
was	1
a	1
trial	1
of	1
skill	1
between	1
them.	1
When	1
they	1
had	1
got	1
it	1
up	1
to	1
three	1
hundred	1
and	1
twenty,	1
the	1
game	1
became	1
very	1
interesting.	1
The	1
arms	1
of	1
the	1
combatants	1
tired	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
scarcely	1
wield	1
the	1
battledores.	1
The	1
shuttlecock	1
began	1
to	1
waver	1
in	1
the	1
air;	1
now	1
it	1
almost	1
touched	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
now,	1
to	1
the	1
astonishment	1
of	1
the	1
spectators,	1
mounted	1
again	1
high	1
over	1
their	1
heads:	1
yet	1
the	1
strokes	1
became	1
feebler	1
and	1
feebler;	1
and	1
"Now,	1
Loveit!"	1
"Now,	1
Tarlton!"	1
resounded	1
on	1
all	1
sides.	1
For	1
another	1
minute	1
the	1
victory	1
was	1
doubtful;	1
but	1
at	1
length	1
the	1
setting	1
sun,	1
shining	1
full	1
in	1
Loveit's	1
face,	1
so	1
dazzled	1
his	1
eyes	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
no	1
longer	1
see	1
the	1
shuttlecock,	1
and	1
it	1
fell	1
at	1
his	1
feet.	1
After	1
the	1
first	1
shout	1
for	1
Tarlton's	1
triumph	1
was	1
over,	1
everybody	1
exclaimed,	1
"Poor	1
Loveit!	1
he's	1
the	1
best	1
natured	1
fellow	1
in	1
the	1
world!	1
What	1
a	1
pity	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
stand	1
with	1
his	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
sun!"	1
"Now,	1
I	1
dare	1
you	1
all	1
to	1
play	1
another	1
game	1
with	1
me,"	1
cried	1
Tarlton,	1
vauntingly;	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
spoke,	1
he	1
tossed	1
the	1
shuttlecock	1
up	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
force--with	1
so	1
much	1
force	1
that	1
it	1
went	1
over	1
the	1
hedge	1
and	1
dropped	1
into	1
a	1
lane,	1
which	1
went	1
close	1
beside	1
the	1
field.	1
"Hey-day!"	1
said	1
Tarlton,	1
"what	1
shall	1
we	1
do	1
now?"	1
The	1
boys	1
were	1
strictly	1
forbidden	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
lane;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
upon	1
their	1
promise	1
not	1
to	1
break	1
this	1
command,	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
allowed	1
to	1
play	1
in	1
the	1
adjoining	1
field.	1
No	1
other	1
shuttlecock	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
had	1
and	1
their	1
play	1
was	1
stopped.	1
They	1
stood	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
bank,	1
peeping	1
over	1
the	1
hedge.	1
"I	1
see	1
it	1
yonder,"	1
said	1
Tarlton;	1
"I	1
wish	1
somebody	1
would	1
get	1
it.	1
One	1
could	1
get	1
over	1
the	1
gate	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
field,	1
and	1
be	1
back	1
again	1
in	1
half	1
a	1
minute,"	1
added	1
he,	1
looking	1
at	1
Loveit.	1
"But	1
you	1
know	1
we	1
must	1
not	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
lane,"	1
said	1
Loveit,	1
hesitatingly.	1
"Pugh!"	1
said	1
Tarlton,	1
"why,	1
now,	1
what	1
harm	1
could	1
it	1
do?"	1
"I	1
don't	1
know,"	1
said	1
Loveit,	1
drumming	1
upon	1
his	1
battledore;	1
"but--"	1
"You	1
don't	1
know,	1
man!	1
why,	1
then,	1
what	1
are	1
you	1
afraid	1
of,	1
I	1
ask	1
you?"	1
Loveit	1
coloured,	1
went	1
on	1
drumming,	1
and	1
again,	1
in	1
a	1
lower	1
voice,	1
said	1
"HE	1
DIDN'T	1
KNOW."	1
But	1
upon	1
Tarlton's	1
repeating,	1
in	1
a	1
more	1
insolent	1
tone,	1
"I	1
ask	1
you,	1
man,	1
what	1
you're	1
afraid	1
of?"	1
he	1
suddenly	1
left	1
off	1
drumming,	1
and	1
looking	1
round,	1
said,	1
"he	1
was	1
not	1
afraid	1
of	1
anything	1
that	1
he	1
knew	1
of."	1
"Yes,	1
but	1
you	1
are,"	1
said	1
Hardy,	1
coming	1
forward.	1
"Am	1
I?"	1
said	1
Loveit;	1
"of	1
what,	1
pray,	1
am	1
I	1
afraid?"	1
"Of	1
doing	1
wrong!"	1
"Afraid	1
OF	1
DOING	1
WRONG!"	1
repeated	1
Tarlton,	1
mimicking	1
him,	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
made	1
everybody	1
laugh.	1
"Now,	1
hadn't	1
you	1
better	1
say	1
afraid	1
of	1
being	1
flogged?"	1
"No,"	1
said	1
Hardy,	1
coolly,	1
after	1
the	1
laugh	1
had	1
somewhat	1
subsided,	1
"I	1
am	1
as	1
little	1
afraid	1
of	1
being	1
flogged	1
as	1
you	1
are,	1
Tarlton;	1
but	1
I	1
meant--"	1
"No	1
matter	1
what	1
you	1
meant;	1
why	1
should	1
you	1
interfere	1
with	1
your	1
wisdom	1
and	1
your	1
meanings;	1
nobody	1
thought	1
of	1
asking	1
YOU	1
to	1
stir	1
a	1
step	1
for	1
us;	1
but	1
we	1
asked	1
Loveit,	1
because	1
he's	1
the	1
best	1
fellow	1
in	1
the	1
world."	1
"And	1
for	1
that	1
very	1
reason	1
you	1
should	1
not	1
ask	1
him,	1
because,	1
you	1
know	1
he	1
can't	1
refuse	1
you	1
anything."	1
"Indeed,	1
though,"	1
cried	1
Loveit,	1
piqued,	1
"THERE	1
you're	1
mistaken,	1
for	1
I	1
could	1
refuse	1
if	1
I	1
chose	1
it."	1
Hardy	1
smiled;	1
and	1
Loveit,	1
half	1
afraid	1
of	1
his	1
contempt,	1
and	1
half	1
afraid	1
of	1
Tarlton's	1
ridicule,	1
stood	1
doubtful,	1
and	1
again	1
had	1
recourse	1
to	1
his	1
battledore,	1
which	1
he	1
balanced	1
most	1
curiously	1
upon	1
his	1
forefinger.	1
"Look	1
at	1
him!--now	1
do	1
look	1
at	1
him!"	1
cried	1
Tarlton;	1
"did	1
you	1
ever	1
in	1
your	1
life	1
see	1
anybody	1
look	1
so	1
silly?--Hardy	1
has	1
him	1
quite	1
under	1
his	1
thumb;	1
he's	1
so	1
mortally	1
afraid	1
of	1
Parson	1
Prig,	1
that	1
he	1
dare	1
not,	1
for	1
the	1
soul	1
of	1
him,	1
turn	1
either	1
of	1
his	1
eyes	1
from	1
the	1
tip	1
of	1
his	1
nose;	1
look	1
how	1
he	1
squints!"	1
"I	1
don't	1
squint,"	1
said	1
Loveit,	1
looking	1
up,	1
"and	1
nobody	1
has	1
me	1
under	1
his	1
thumb!	1
and	1
what	1
Hardy	1
said	1
was	1
only	1
for	1
fear	1
I	1
should	1
get	1
in	1
disgrace;	1
he's	1
the	1
best	1
friend	1
I	1
have."	1
Loveit	1
spoke	1
this	1
with	1
more	1
than	1
usual	1
spirit,	1
for	1
both	1
his	1
heart	1
and	1
his	1
pride	1
were	1
touched.	1
"Come	1
along,	1
then,"	1
said	1
Hardy,	1
taking	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
arm	1
in	1
an	1
affectionate	1
manner;	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
just	1
going,	1
when	1
Tarlton	1
called	1
after	1
him,	1
"Ay,	1
go	1
along	1
with	1
its	1
best	1
friend,	1
and	1
take	1
care	1
it	1
does	1
not	1
get	1
into	1
a	1
scrape;-	1
-good-bye,	1
Little	1
Panado!"	1
"Whom	1
do	1
they	1
call	1
Little	1
Panado?"	1
said	1
Loveit,	1
turning	1
his	1
head	1
hastily	1
back.	1
"Never	1
mind,"	1
said	1
Hardy,	1
"what	1
does	1
it	1
signify?"	1
"No,"	1
said	1
Loveit,	1
"to	1
be	1
sure	1
it	1
does	1
not	1
signify;	1
but	1
one	1
does	1
not	1
like	1
to	1
be	1
called	1
Little	1
Panado:	1
besides,"	1
added	1
he,	1
after	1
going	1
a	1
few	1
steps	1
farther,	1
"they'll	1
all	1
think	1
it	1
so	1
ill-natured.	1
I	1
had	1
better	1
go	1
back,	1
and	1
just	1
tell	1
them	1
that	1
I'm	1
very	1
sorry	1
I	1
can't	1
get	1
their	1
shuttlecock;	1
do	1
come	1
back	1
with	1
me."	1
"No,"	1
said	1
Hardy,	1
"I	1
can't	1
go	1
back;	1
and	1
you'd	1
better	1
not."	1
"But,	1
I	1
assure	1
you,	1
I	1
won't	1
stay	1
a	1
minute;	1
wait	1
for	1
me,"	1
added	1
Loveit;	1
and	1
he	1
slunk	1
back	1
again	1
to	1
prove	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
Little	1
Panado.	1
Once	1
returned,	1
the	1
rest	1
followed,	1
of	1
course;	1
for	1
to	1
support	1
his	1
character	1
of	1
good-nature	1
he	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
yield	1
to	1
the	1
entreaties	1
of	1
his	1
companions,	1
and	1
to	1
show	1
his	1
spirit,	1
leapt	1
over	1
the	1
gate,	1
amidst	1
the	1
acclamations	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
mob:--he	1
was	1
quickly	1
out	1
of	1
sight.	1
"Here,"	1
cried	1
he,	1
returning	1
in	1
about	1
five	1
minutes,	1
quite	1
out	1
of	1
breath,	1
"I've	1
got	1
the	1
shuttlecock;	1
and	1
I'll	1
tell	1
you	1
what	1
I've	1
seen,"	1
cried	1
he,	1
panting	1
for	1
breath.	1
"What?"	1
cried	1
everybody,	1
eagerly.	1
"Why,	1
just	1
at	1
the	1
turn	1
of	1
the	1
corner,	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
lane"--panting.	1
"Well,"	1
said	1
Tarlton,	1
impatiently,	1
"do	1
go	1
on."	1
"Let	1
me	1
just	1
take	1
breath	1
first."	1
"Pugh--never	1
mind	1
your	1
breath."	1
"Well,	1
then,	1
just	1
at	1
the	1
turn	1
of	1
the	1
corner,	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
lane,	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
looking	1
about	1
for	1
the	1
shuttlecock,	1
I	1
heard	1
a	1
great	1
rustling	1
somewhere	1
near	1
me,	1
and	1
so	1
I	1
looked	1
where	1
it	1
could	1
come	1
from;	1
and	1
I	1
saw,	1
in	1
a	1
nice	1
little	1
garden,	1
on	1
the	1
opposite	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
way,	1
a	1
boy,	1
about	1
as	1
big	1
as	1
Tarlton,	1
sitting	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
tree,	1
shaking	1
the	1
branches:	1
so	1
I	1
called	1
to	1
the	1
boy,	1
to	1
beg	1
one;	1
but	1
he	1
said	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
give	1
me	1
one,	1
for	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
his	1
grandfather's;	1
and	1
just	1
at	1
that	1
minute,	1
from	1
behind	1
a	1
gooseberry	1
bush,	1
up	1
popped	1
the	1
uncle;	1
the	1
grandfather	1
poked	1
his	1
head	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window;	1
so	1
I	1
ran	1
off	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
my	1
legs	1
would	1
carry	1
me	1
though	1
I	1
heard	1
him	1
bawling	1
after	1
me	1
all	1
the	1
way."	1
"And	1
let	1
him	1
bawl,"	1
cried	1
Tarlton;	1
"he	1
shan't	1
bawl	1
for	1
nothing;	1
I'm	1
determined	1
we'll	1
have	1
some	1
of	1
his	1
fine	1
large	1
rosy	1
apples	1
before	1
I	1
sleep	1
to-night."	1
At	1
this	1
speech	1
a	1
general	1
silence	1
ensued;	1
everybody	1
kept	1
their	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
upon	1
Tarlton,	1
except	1
Loveit,	1
who	1
looked	1
down,	1
apprehensive	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
drawn	1
on	1
much	1
farther	1
than	1
he	1
intended.	1
"Oh,	1
indeed!"	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
himself,	1
"as	1
Hardy	1
told	1
me,	1
I	1
had	1
better	1
not	1
have	1
come	1
back!"	1
Regardless	1
of	1
this	1
confusion,	1
Tarlton	1
continued,	1
"But	1
before	1
I	1
say	1
any	1
more,	1
I	1
hope	1
we	1
have	1
no	1
spies	1
amongst	1
us.	1
If	1
there	1
is	1
any	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
afraid	1
to	1
be	1
flogged,	1
let	1
him	1
march	1
off	1
this	1
instant!"	1
Loveit	1
coloured,	1
bit	1
his	1
lips,	1
wished	1
to	1
go,	1
but	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
courage	1
to	1
move	1
first.	1
He	1
waited	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
everybody	1
else	1
would	1
do:	1
nobody	1
stirred;	1
so	1
Loveit	1
stood	1
still.	1
"Well,	1
then,"	1
cried	1
Tarlton,	1
giving	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
the	1
boy	1
next	1
him,	1
then	1
to	1
the	1
next,	1
"your	1
word	1
and	1
honour	1
that	1
you	1
won't	1
betray	1
me;	1
but	1
stand	1
by	1
me,	1
and	1
I'll	1
stand	1
by	1
you."	1
Each	1
boy	1
gave	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
his	1
promise;	1
repeating,	1
"Stand	1
by	1
me,	1
and	1
I'll	1
stand	1
by	1
you."	1
Loveit	1
hung	1
back	1
till	1
the	1
last;	1
and	1
had	1
almost	1
twisted	1
off	1
the	1
button	1
of	1
the	1
boy's	1
coat	1
who	1
screened	1
him,	1
when	1
Tarlton	1
came	1
up,	1
holding	1
out	1
his	1
hand,	1
"Come,	1
Loveit,	1
lad,	1
you're	1
in	1
for	1
it:	1
stand	1
by	1
me,	1
and	1
I'll	1
stand	1
by	1
you."	1
"Indeed,	1
Tarlton,"	1
expostulated	1
he,	1
without	1
looking	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
face,	1
"I	1
do	1
wish	1
you'd	1
give	1
up	1
this	1
scheme;	1
I	1
daresay	1
all	1
the	1
apples	1
are	1
gone	1
by	1
this	1
time;	1
I	1
wish	1
you	1
would.	1
Do,	1
pray,	1
give	1
up	1
this	1
scheme."	1
"What	1
scheme,	1
man?	1
you	1
have'n't	1
heard	1
it	1
yet;	1
you	1
may	1
as	1
well	1
know	1
your	1
text	1
before	1
you	1
begin	1
preaching."	1
The	1
corners	1
of	1
Loveit's	1
mouth	1
could	1
not	1
refuse	1
to	1
smile,	1
though	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
he	1
felt	1
not	1
the	1
slightest	1
inclination	1
to	1
laugh.	1
"Why,	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
you,	1
I	1
declare	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
you	1
to-day,"	1
said	1
Tarlton;	1
"you	1
used	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
best	1
natured	1
most	1
agreeable	1
lad	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
would	1
do	1
anything	1
one	1
asked	1
you;	1
but	1
you're	1
quite	1
altered	1
of	1
late,	1
as	1
we	1
were	1
saying	1
just	1
now,	1
when	1
you	1
skulked	1
away	1
with	1
Hardy:	1
come,--do,	1
man,	1
pluck	1
up	1
a	1
little	1
spirit,	1
and	1
be	1
one	1
of	1
us,	1
or	1
you'll	1
make	1
us	1
all	1
HATE	1
YOU."	1
"HATE	1
me!"	1
repeated	1
Loveit,	1
with	1
terror;	1
"no,	1
surely,	1
you	1
won't	1
all	1
HATE	1
me!"	1
and	1
he	1
mechanically	1
stretched	1
out	1
his	1
hand	1
which	1
Tarlton	1
shook	1
violently,	1
saying,	1
"Ay,	1
now,	1
that's	1
right."	1
"Ay,	1
now,	1
that's	1
wrong!"	1
whispered	1
Loveit's	1
conscience;	1
but	1
his	1
conscience	1
was	1
of	1
no	1
use	1
to	1
him,	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
always	1
overpowered	1
by	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
numbers;	1
and	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
wish,	1
he	1
never	1
had	1
the	1
power,	1
to	1
do	1
right.	1
"Poor	1
Loveit!	1
I	1
knew	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
refuse	1
us,"	1
cried	1
his	1
companions;	1
and	1
even	1
Tarlton,	1
the	1
moment	1
he	1
shook	1
hands	1
with	1
him,	1
despised	1
him.	1
It	1
is	1
certain	1
that	1
weakness	1
of	1
mind	1
is	1
despised	1
both	1
by	1
the	1
good	1
and	1
the	1
bad.	1
The	1
league	1
being	1
thus	1
formed,	1
Tarlton	1
assumed	1
all	1
the	1
airs	1
of	1
commander,	1
explained	1
his	1
schemes,	1
and	1
laid	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
attack	1
upon	1
the	1
poor	1
old	1
man's	1
apple-tree.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
one	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
world.	1
We	1
shall	1
not	1
dwell	1
upon	1
their	1
consultation;	1
for	1
the	1
amusement	1
of	1
contriving	1
such	1
expeditions	1
is	1
often	1
the	1
chief	1
thing	1
which	1
induces	1
idle	1
boys	1
to	1
engage	1
in	1
them.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
small	1
window	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
back	1
staircase,	1
through	1
which,	1
between	1
nine	1
and	1
ten	1
o'clock	1
at	1
night,	1
Tarlton,	1
accompanied	1
by	1
Loveit	1
and	1
another	1
boy,	1
crept	1
out.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
moonlight	1
night,	1
and	1
after	1
crossing	1
the	1
field,	1
and	1
climbing	1
the	1
gate,	1
directed	1
by	1
Loveit,	1
who	1
now	1
resolved	1
to	1
go	1
through	1
the	1
affair	1
with	1
spirit,	1
they	1
proceeded	1
down	1
the	1
lane	1
with	1
rash	1
yet	1
fearful	1
steps.	1
At	1
a	1
distance	1
Loveit	1
saw	1
the	1
white	1
washed	1
cottage,	1
and	1
the	1
apple-tree	1
beside	1
it.	1
They	1
quickened	1
their	1
pace,	1
and	1
with	1
some	1
difficulty	1
scrambled	1
through	1
the	1
hedge	1
which	1
fenced	1
the	1
garden,	1
though	1
not	1
without	1
being	1
scratched	1
and	1
torn	1
by	1
the	1
briers.	1
Everything	1
was	1
silent.	1
Yet	1
now	1
and	1
then,	1
at	1
every	1
rustling	1
of	1
the	1
leaves,	1
they	1
started,	1
and	1
their	1
hearts	1
beat	1
violently.	1
Once,	1
as	1
Loveit	1
was	1
climbing	1
the	1
apple-tree,	1
he	1
thought	1
he	1
heard	1
a	1
door	1
in	1
the	1
cottage	1
open,	1
and	1
earnestly	1
begged	1
his	1
companions	1
to	1
desist	1
and	1
return	1
home.	1
This,	1
however,	1
he	1
could	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
persuade	1
them	1
to	1
do,	1
until	1
they	1
had	1
filled	1
their	1
pockets	1
with	1
apples;	1
then,	1
to	1
his	1
great	1
joy,	1
they	1
returned,	1
crept	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
each	1
retired,	1
as	1
softly	1
as	1
possible,	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
apartment.	1
Loveit	1
slept	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
with	1
Hardy,	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
fast	1
asleep,	1
and	1
whom	1
he	1
now	1
was	1
extremely	1
afraid	1
of	1
awakening.	1
All	1
the	1
apples	1
were	1
emptied	1
out	1
of	1
Loveit's	1
pockets,	1
and	1
lodged	1
with	1
Tarlton	1
till	1
the	1
morning,	1
for	1
fear	1
the	1
smell	1
should	1
betray	1
the	1
secret	1
to	1
Hardy.	1
The	1
room	1
door	1
was	1
apt	1
to	1
creak,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
opened	1
with	1
such	1
precaution,	1
that	1
no	1
noise	1
could	1
be	1
heard,	1
and	1
Loveit	1
found	1
his	1
friend	1
as	1
fast	1
asleep	1
as	1
when	1
he	1
left	1
him.	1
"Ah,"	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
himself,	1
"how	1
quietly	1
he	1
sleeps!	1
I	1
wish	1
I	1
had	1
been	1
sleeping	1
too."	1
The	1
reproaches	1
of	1
Loveit's	1
conscience,	1
however,	1
served	1
no	1
other	1
purpose	1
but	1
to	1
torment	1
him;	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
sufficient	1
strength	1
of	1
mind	1
to	1
be	1
good.	1
The	1
very	1
next	1
night,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
fears,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
penitence,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
resolutions,	1
by	1
a	1
little	1
fresh	1
ridicule	1
and	1
persuasion	1
he	1
was	1
induced	1
to	1
accompany	1
the	1
same	1
party	1
on	1
a	1
similar	1
expedition.	1
We	1
must	1
observe,	1
that	1
the	1
necessity	1
for	1
continuing	1
their	1
depredations	1
became	1
stronger	1
the	1
third	1
day;	1
for,	1
though	1
at	1
first	1
only	1
a	1
small	1
party	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
secret,	1
by	1
degrees	1
it	1
was	1
divulged	1
to	1
the	1
whole	1
school;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
necessary	1
to	1
secure	1
secrecy	1
by	1
sharing	1
the	1
booty.	1
Everyone	1
was	1
astonished	1
that	1
Hardy,	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
quickness	1
and	1
penetration,	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
discovered	1
their	1
proceedings;	1
but	1
Loveit	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
suspecting	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
quite	1
so	1
ignorant	1
as	1
he	1
appeared	1
to	1
be.	1
Loveit	1
had	1
strictly	1
kept	1
his	1
promise	1
of	1
secrecy;	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
an	1
artful	1
boy;	1
and	1
in	1
talking	1
to	1
his	1
friend,	1
conscious	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
something	1
to	1
conceal,	1
he	1
was	1
perpetually	1
on	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
betraying	1
himself;	1
then	1
recollecting	1
his	1
engagement,	1
he	1
blushed,	1
stammered,	1
bungled;	1
and	1
upon	1
Hardy's	1
asking	1
what	1
he	1
meant,	1
would	1
answer	1
with	1
a	1
silly,	1
guilty	1
countenance,	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know;	1
or	1
abruptly	1
break	1
off,	1
saying,	1
"Oh	1
nothing!	1
nothing	1
at	1
all!"	1
It	1
was	1
in	1
vain	1
that	1
he	1
urged	1
Tarlton	1
to	1
permit	1
him	1
to	1
consult	1
his	1
friend.	1
A	1
gloom	1
overspread	1
Tarlton's	1
brow	1
when	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
speak	1
on	1
the	1
subject,	1
and	1
he	1
always	1
returned	1
a	1
peremptory	1
refusal,	1
accompanied	1
with	1
some	1
such	1
taunting	1
expression	1
as	1
this--"I	1
wish	1
we	1
had	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
sneaking	1
fellow;	1
he'll	1
betray	1
us	1
all,	1
I	1
see,	1
before	1
we	1
have	1
done	1
with	1
him."	1
"Well,"	1
said	1
Loveit	1
to	1
himself,	1
"so	1
I	1
am	1
abused	1
after	1
all,	1
and	1
called	1
a	1
sneaking	1
fellow	1
for	1
my	1
pains;	1
that's	1
rather	1
hard,	1
to	1
be	1
sure,	1
when	1
I've	1
got	1
so	1
little	1
by	1
the	1
job."	1
In	1
truth	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
got	1
much;	1
for	1
in	1
the	1
division	1
of	1
the	1
booty	1
only	1
one	1
apple,	1
and	1
half	1
of	1
another,	1
which	1
was	1
only	1
half	1
ripe,	1
happened	1
to	1
fall	1
to	1
his	1
share;	1
though,	1
to	1
be	1
sure,	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
all	1
eaten	1
their	1
apples,	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
satisfaction	1
to	1
hear	1
everybody	1
declare	1
they	1
were	1
very	1
sorry	1
they	1
had	1
forgotten	1
to	1
offer	1
some	1
of	1
theirs	1
to	1
"POOR	1
LOVEIT."	1
In	1
the	1
meantime,	1
the	1
visits	1
to	1
the	1
apple-tree	1
had	1
been	1
now	1
too	1
frequently	1
repeated	1
to	1
remain	1
concealed	1
from	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
who	1
lived	1
in	1
the	1
cottage.	1
He	1
used	1
to	1
examine	1
his	1
only	1
tree	1
very	1
frequently,	1
and	1
missing	1
numbers	1
of	1
rosy	1
apples,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
watched	1
ripening,	1
he,	1
though	1
not	1
prone	1
to	1
suspicion,	1
began	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
going	1
wrong;	1
especially	1
as	1
a	1
gap	1
was	1
made	1
in	1
his	1
hedge,	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
several	1
small	1
footsteps	1
in	1
his	1
flower	1
beds.	1
The	1
good	1
old	1
man	1
was	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
inclined	1
to	1
give	1
pain	1
to	1
any	1
living	1
creature,	1
much	1
less	1
to	1
children,	1
of	1
whom	1
he	1
was	1
particularly	1
fond.	1
Nor	1
was	1
he	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
avaricious,	1
for	1
though	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
rich,	1
he	1
had	1
enough	1
to	1
live	1
upon,	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
very	1
industrious	1
in	1
his	1
youth;	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
always	1
very	1
ready	1
to	1
part	1
with	1
the	1
little	1
he	1
had.	1
Nor	1
was	1
he	1
a	1
cross	1
old	1
man.	1
If	1
anything	1
would	1
have	1
made	1
him	1
angry,	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
seeing	1
his	1
favourite	1
tree	1
robbed,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
promised	1
himself	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
giving	1
his	1
red	1
apples	1
to	1
his	1
grandchildren	1
on	1
his	1
birthday.	1
However,	1
he	1
looked	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
tree	1
in	1
sorrow	1
rather	1
than	1
in	1
anger,	1
and	1
leaning	1
upon	1
his	1
staff,	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
consider	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
best	1
do.	1
"If	1
I	1
complain	1
to	1
their	1
master,"	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
himself,	1
"they	1
will	1
certainly	1
be	1
flogged,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
sorry	1
for:	1
yet	1
they	1
must	1
not	1
be	1
let	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
stealing;	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
worse	1
still,	1
for	1
it	1
would	1
surely	1
bring	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
gallows	1
in	1
the	1
end.	1
Let	1
me	1
see--oh,	1
ay,	1
that	1
will	1
do;	1
I	1
will	1
borrow	1
farmer	1
Kent's	1
dog	1
Barker,	1
he'll	1
keep	1
them	1
off,	1
I'll	1
answer	1
for	1
it."	1
Farmer	1
Kent	1
lent	1
his	1
dog	1
Barker,	1
cautioning	1
his	1
neighbour,	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
to	1
be	1
sure	1
to	1
chain	1
him	1
well,	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
fiercest	1
mastiff	1
in	1
England.	1
The	1
old	1
man,	1
with	1
farmer	1
Kent's	1
assistance,	1
chained	1
him	1
fast	1
to	1
the	1
trunk	1
of	1
the	1
apple-tree.	1
Night	1
came;	1
and	1
Tarlton,	1
Loveit	1
and	1
his	1
companions,	1
returned	1
at	1
the	1
usual	1
hour.	1
Grown	1
bolder	1
now	1
by	1
frequent	1
success,	1
they	1
came	1
on	1
talking	1
and	1
laughing.	1
But	1
the	1
moment	1
they	1
had	1
set	1
their	1
foot	1
in	1
the	1
garden,	1
the	1
dog	1
started	1
up;	1
and,	1
shaking	1
the	1
chain	1
as	1
he	1
sprang	1
forward,	1
barked	1
with	1
unremitting	1
fury.	1
They	1
stood	1
still	1
as	1
if	1
fixed	1
to	1
the	1
spot.	1
There	1
was	1
just	1
moonlight	1
enough	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
dog.	1
"Let	1
us	1
try	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
tree,"	1
said	1
Tarlton.	1
But	1
to	1
whichever	1
side	1
they	1
turned,	1
the	1
dog	1
flew	1
round	1
in	1
an	1
instant,	1
barking	1
with	1
increased	1
fury.	1
"He'll	1
break	1
his	1
chain	1
and	1
tear	1
us	1
to	1
pieces,"	1
cried	1
Tarlton;	1
and,	1
struck	1
with	1
terror,	1
he	1
immediately	1
threw	1
down	1
the	1
basket	1
he	1
had	1
brought	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
betook	1
himself	1
to	1
flight,	1
with	1
the	1
greatest	1
precipitation.	1
"Help	1
me!	1
oh,	1
pray,	1
help	1
me!	1
I	1
can't	1
get	1
through	1
the	1
hedge,"	1
cried	1
Loveit,	1
in	1
a	1
lamentable	1
tone,	1
whilst	1
the	1
dog	1
growled	1
hideously,	1
and	1
sprang	1
forward	1
to	1
the	1
extremity	1
of	1
his	1
chain.	1
"I	1
can't	1
get	1
out!	1
Oh,	1
for	1
God's	1
sake,	1
stay	1
for	1
me	1
one	1
minute,	1
dear	1
Tarlton!"	1
He	1
called	1
in	1
vain;	1
he	1
was	1
left	1
to	1
struggle	1
through	1
his	1
difficulties	1
by	1
himself;	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
dear	1
friends	1
not	1
one	1
turned	1
back	1
to	1
help	1
him.	1
At	1
last,	1
torn	1
and	1
terrified,	1
he	1
got	1
through	1
the	1
hedge	1
and	1
ran	1
home,	1
despising	1
his	1
companions	1
for	1
their	1
selfishness.	1
Nor	1
could	1
he	1
help	1
observing	1
that	1
Tarlton,	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
vaunted	1
prowess,	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
run	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
danger.	1
The	1
next	1
morning	1
Loveit	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
reproaching	1
the	1
party	1
with	1
their	1
conduct.	1
"Why	1
could	1
not	1
you,	1
any	1
of	1
you,	1
stay	1
one	1
minute	1
to	1
help	1
me?"	1
said	1
he.	1
"We	1
did	1
not	1
hear	1
you	1
call,"	1
answered	1
one.	1
"I	1
was	1
so	1
frightened,"	1
said	1
another,	1
"I	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
turned	1
back	1
for	1
the	1
whole	1
world."	1
"And	1
you,	1
Tarlton?"	1
"I,"	1
said	1
Tarlton;	1
"had	1
not	1
I	1
enough	1
to	1
do	1
to	1
take	1
care	1
of	1
myself,	1
you	1
blockhead?	1
Everyone	1
for	1
himself	1
in	1
this	1
world!"	1
"So	1
I	1
see,"	1
said	1
Loveit,	1
gravely.	1
"Well,	1
man!	1
is	1
there	1
anything	1
strange	1
in	1
that?"	1
"Strange!	1
why,	1
yes;	1
I	1
thought	1
you	1
all	1
loved	1
me!"	1
"Lord	1
love	1
you,	1
lad!	1
so	1
we	1
do;	1
but	1
we	1
love	1
ourselves	1
better."	1
"Hardy	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
served	1
me	1
so,	1
however,"	1
said	1
Loveit,	1
turning	1
away	1
in	1
disgust.	1
Tarlton	1
was	1
alarmed.	1
"Pugh!"	1
said	1
he;	1
"what	1
nonsense	1
have	1
you	1
taken	1
into	1
your	1
brain!	1
Think	1
no	1
more	1
about	1
it.	1
We	1
are	1
all	1
very	1
sorry,	1
and	1
beg	1
your	1
pardon;	1
come,	1
shake	1
hands,	1
forgive	1
and	1
forget."	1
Loveit	1
gave	1
his	1
hand,	1
but	1
gave	1
it	1
rather	1
coldly.	1
"I	1
forgive	1
it	1
with	1
all	1
my	1
heart,"	1
said	1
he;	1
"but	1
I	1
cannot	1
forget	1
it	1
so	1
soon!"	1
"Why,	1
then,	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
such	1
a	1
good	1
humoured	1
fellow	1
as	1
we	1
thought	1
you	1
were.	1
Surely	1
you	1
cannot	1
bear	1
malice,	1
Loveit."	1
Loveit	1
smiled,	1
and	1
allowed	1
that	1
he	1
certainly	1
could	1
not	1
bear	1
malice.	1
"Well,	1
then,	1
come;	1
you	1
know	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
we	1
all	1
love	1
you,	1
and	1
would	1
do	1
anything	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
for	1
you."	1
Poor	1
Loveit,	1
flattered	1
in	1
his	1
foible,	1
began	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
love	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
bottom,	1
as	1
they	1
said,	1
and	1
even	1
with	1
his	1
eyes	1
open	1
consented	1
again	1
to	1
be	1
duped.	1
"How	1
strange	1
it	1
is,"	1
thought	1
he,	1
"that	1
I	1
should	1
set	1
such	1
value	1
upon	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
those	1
I	1
despise!	1
When	1
I'm	1
once	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
scrape,	1
I'll	1
have	1
no	1
more	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
them,	1
I'm	1
determined."	1
Compared	1
with	1
his	1
friend	1
Hardy,	1
his	1
new	1
associates	1
did	1
indeed	1
appear	1
contemptible;	1
for	1
all	1
this	1
time	1
Hardy	1
had	1
treated	1
him	1
with	1
uniform	1
kindness,	1
avoided	1
to	1
pry	1
into	1
his	1
secrets,	1
yet	1
seemed	1
ready	1
to	1
receive	1
his	1
confidence,	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
offered.	1
After	1
school	1
in	1
the	1
evening,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
standing	1
silently	1
beside	1
Hardy,	1
who	1
was	1
ruling	1
a	1
sheet	1
of	1
paper	1
for	1
him,	1
Tarlton,	1
in	1
his	1
brutal	1
manner,	1
came	1
up,	1
and	1
seizing	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
arm,	1
cried,	1
"Come	1
along	1
with	1
me,	1
Loveit,	1
I've	1
something	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
you."	1
"I	1
can't	1
come	1
now,"	1
said	1
Loveit,	1
drawing	1
away	1
his	1
arm.	1
"Ah,	1
do	1
come	1
now,"	1
said	1
Tarlton,	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
of	1
persuasion.	1
"Well,	1
I'll	1
come	1
presently."	1
"Nay,	1
but	1
do,	1
pray;	1
there's	1
a	1
good	1
fellow,	1
come	1
now,	1
because	1
I	1
have	1
something	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
you."	1
"What	1
is	1
it	1
you've	1
got	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
me?	1
I	1
wish	1
you'd	1
let	1
me	1
alone,"	1
said	1
Loveit;	1
yet	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
he	1
suffered	1
himself	1
to	1
he	1
led	1
away.	1
Tarlton	1
took	1
particular	1
pains	1
to	1
humour	1
him	1
and	1
bring	1
him	1
into	1
temper	1
again;	1
and	1
even	1
though	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
very	1
apt	1
to	1
part	1
with	1
his	1
playthings,	1
went	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
to	1
say,	1
"Loveit,	1
the	1
other	1
day	1
you	1
wanted	1
a	1
top;	1
I'll	1
give	1
you	1
mine	1
if	1
you	1
desire	1
it."	1
Loveit	1
thanked	1
him,	1
and	1
was	1
overjoyed	1
at	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
possessing	1
this	1
top.	1
"But	1
what	1
did	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
me	1
just	1
now?"	1
"Ay,	1
we'll	1
talk	1
of	1
that	1
presently;	1
not	1
yet--when	1
we	1
get	1
out	1
of	1
hearing."	1
"Nobody	1
is	1
near	1
us,"	1
said	1
Loveit.	1
"Come	1
a	1
little	1
farther	1
however,"	1
said	1
Tarlton,	1
looking	1
round	1
suspiciously.	1
"Well	1
now,	1
well?"	1
"You	1
know	1
the	1
dog	1
that	1
frightened	1
us	1
last	1
night?"	1
"Yes."	1
"It	1
will	1
never	1
frighten	1
us	1
again."	1
"Won't	1
it?	1
how	1
so?"	1
"Look	1
here,"	1
said	1
Tarlton,	1
drawing	1
something	1
from	1
his	1
pocket	1
wrapped	1
in	1
a	1
blue	1
handkerchief.	1
"What's	1
that?"	1
Tarlton	1
opened	1
it.	1
"Raw	1
meat!"	1
exclaimed	1
Loveit.	1
"How	1
came	1
you	1
by	1
it?"	1
"Tom,	1
the	1
servant	1
boy,	1
Tom	1
got	1
it	1
for	1
me;	1
and	1
I'm	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
sixpence."	1
"And	1
is	1
it	1
for	1
the	1
dog?"	1
"Yes;	1
I	1
vowed	1
I'd	1
be	1
revenged	1
on	1
him,	1
and	1
after	1
this	1
he'll	1
never	1
bark	1
again."	1
"Never	1
bark	1
again!	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
mean?	1
Is	1
it	1
poison?"	1
exclaimed	1
Loveit,	1
starting	1
back	1
with	1
horror.	1
"Only	1
poison	1
for	1
A	1
DOG,"	1
said	1
Tarlton,	1
confused;	1
"you	1
could	1
not	1
look	1
more	1
shocking	1
if	1
it	1
was	1
poison	1
for	1
a	1
Christian."	1
Loveit	1
stood	1
for	1
nearly	1
a	1
minute	1
in	1
profound	1
silence.	1
"Tarlton,"	1
said	1
he	1
at	1
last,	1
in	1
a	1
changed	1
tone	1
and	1
altered	1
manner,	1
"I	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
you;	1
I	1
will	1
have	1
no	1
more	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
you."	1
"Nay,	1
but	1
stay,"	1
said	1
Tarlton,	1
catching	1
hold	1
of	1
his	1
arm,	1
"stay;	1
I	1
was	1
only	1
joking."	1
"Let	1
go	1
my	1
arm--you	1
were	1
in	1
earnest."	1
"But	1
then	1
that	1
was	1
before	1
I	1
knew	1
there	1
was	1
any	1
harm.	1
If	1
you	1
think	1
there's	1
any	1
harm?"	1
"IF,"	1
said	1
Loveit.	1
"Why,	1
you	1
know,	1
I	1
might	1
not	1
know;	1
for	1
Tom	1
told	1
me	1
it's	1
a	1
thing	1
that's	1
often	1
done.	1
Ask	1
Tom."	1
"I'll	1
ask	1
nobody!	1
Surely	1
we	1
know	1
better	1
what's	1
right	1
and	1
wrong	1
than	1
Tom	1
does."	1
"But	1
only	1
just	1
ask	1
him,	1
to	1
hear	1
what	1
he'll	1
say."	1
"I	1
don't	1
want	1
to	1
hear	1
what	1
he'll	1
say,"	1
cried	1
Loveit,	1
vehemently:	1
"the	1
dog	1
will	1
die	1
in	1
agonies--in	1
agonies!	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
dog	1
poisoned	1
at	1
my	1
father's--I	1
saw	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
yard.	1
Poor	1
creature!	1
He	1
lay	1
and	1
howled	1
and	1
writhed	1
himself!"	1
"Poor	1
creature!	1
Well,	1
there's	1
no	1
harm	1
done	1
now,"	1
cried	1
Tarlton,	1
in	1
a	1
hypocritical	1
tone.	1
But	1
though	1
he	1
thought	1
fit	1
to	1
dissemble	1
with	1
Loveit,	1
he	1
was	1
thoroughly	1
determined	1
in	1
his	1
purpose.	1
Poor	1
Loveit,	1
in	1
haste	1
to	1
get	1
away,	1
returned	1
to	1
his	1
friend	1
Hardy;	1
but	1
his	1
mind	1
was	1
in	1
such	1
agitation,	1
that	1
he	1
neither	1
talked	1
nor	1
moved	1
like	1
himself;	1
and	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
times	1
his	1
heart	1
was	1
so	1
full	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
burst	1
into	1
tears.	1
"How	1
good-natured	1
you	1
are	1
to	1
me,"	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
Hardy,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
trying	1
vainly	1
to	1
entertain	1
him;	1
"but	1
if	1
you	1
knew--"	1
Here	1
he	1
stopped	1
short,	1
for	1
the	1
bell	1
for	1
evening	1
prayer	1
rang,	1
and	1
they	1
all	1
took	1
their	1
places,	1
and	1
knelt	1
down.	1
After	1
prayers,	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
going	1
to	1
bed,	1
Loveit	1
stopped	1
Tarlton,--"WELL!"	1
asked	1
he,	1
in	1
an	1
inquiring	1
manner,	1
fixing	1
his	1
eyes	1
upon	1
him.	1
"WELL!"	1
replied	1
Tarlton,	1
in	1
an	1
audacious	1
tone,	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
meant	1
to	1
set	1
his	1
inquiring	1
eye	1
at	1
defiance.	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
mean	1
to	1
do	1
to-night?"	1
"To	1
go	1
to	1
sleep,	1
as	1
you	1
do,	1
I	1
suppose,"	1
replied	1
Tarlton,	1
turning	1
away	1
abruptly,	1
and	1
whistling	1
as	1
he	1
walked	1
off.	1
"Oh,	1
he	1
has	1
certainly	1
changed	1
his	1
mind!"	1
said	1
Loveit	1
to	1
himself,	1
"else	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
whistle."	1
About	1
ten	1
minutes	1
after	1
this,	1
as	1
he	1
and	1
Hardy	1
were	1
undressing,	1
Hardy	1
suddenly	1
recollected	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
his	1
new	1
kite	1
out	1
upon	1
the	1
grass.	1
"Oh,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"it	1
will	1
be	1
quite	1
spoiled	1
before	1
morning!"	1
"Call	1
Tom,"	1
said	1
Loveit,	1
"and	1
bid	1
him	1
bring	1
it	1
in	1
for	1
you	1
in	1
a	1
minute."	1
They	1
both	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
stairs	1
to	1
call	1
Tom;	1
no	1
one	1
answered.	1
They	1
called	1
again	1
louder,	1
"Is	1
Tom	1
below?"	1
"I'm	1
here,"	1
answered	1
he	1
at	1
last,	1
coming	1
out	1
of	1
Tarlton's	1
room	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
mixed	1
embarrassment	1
and	1
effrontery.	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
receiving	1
Hardy's	1
commission,	1
Loveit	1
saw	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
blue	1
handkerchief	1
hanging	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
pocket.	1
This	1
excited	1
fresh	1
suspicions	1
in	1
Loveit's	1
mind;	1
but,	1
without	1
saying	1
one	1
word,	1
he	1
immediately	1
stationed	1
himself	1
at	1
the	1
window	1
in	1
his	1
room,	1
which	1
looked	1
out	1
towards	1
the	1
lane;	1
and,	1
as	1
the	1
moon	1
was	1
risen,	1
he	1
could	1
see	1
if	1
anyone	1
passed	1
that	1
way.	1
"What	1
are	1
you	1
doing	1
there?"	1
said	1
Hardy,	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
watching	1
some	1
time;	1
"why	1
don't	1
you	1
come	1
to	1
bed?"	1
Loveit	1
returned	1
no	1
answer,	1
but	1
continued	1
standing	1
at	1
the	1
window.	1
Nor	1
did	1
he	1
watch	1
long	1
in	1
vain.	1
Presently	1
he	1
saw	1
Tom	1
gliding	1
slowly	1
along	1
a	1
by-path,	1
and	1
get	1
over	1
the	1
gate	1
into	1
the	1
lane.	1
"He's	1
gone	1
to	1
do	1
it!"	1
exclaimed	1
Loveit	1
aloud,	1
with	1
an	1
emotion	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
command.	1
"Who's	1
gone?	1
to	1
do	1
what?"	1
cried	1
Hardy,	1
starting	1
up.	1
"How	1
cruel!	1
how	1
wicked!"	1
continued	1
Loveit.	1
"What's	1
cruel--what's	1
wicked?	1
speak	1
out	1
at	1
once!"	1
returned	1
Hardy,	1
in	1
that	1
commanding	1
tone	1
which,	1
in	1
moments	1
of	1
danger,	1
strong	1
minds	1
feel	1
themselves	1
entitled	1
to	1
assume	1
towards	1
weak	1
ones.	1
Loveit	1
instantly,	1
though	1
in	1
an	1
incoherent	1
manner,	1
explained	1
the	1
affair	1
to	1
him.	1
Scarcely	1
had	1
the	1
words	1
passed	1
his	1
lips,	1
when	1
Hardy	1
sprang	1
up,	1
and	1
began	1
dressing	1
himself	1
without	1
saying	1
one	1
syllable.	1
"For	1
God's	1
sake,	1
what	1
are	1
you	1
going	1
to	1
do?"	1
said	1
Loveit,	1
in	1
great	1
anxiety.	1
"They'll	1
never	1
forgive	1
me!	1
don't	1
betray	1
me!	1
they'll	1
never	1
forgive!	1
pray,	1
speak	1
to	1
me!	1
only	1
say	1
you	1
won't	1
betray	1
us."	1
"I	1
will	1
not	1
betray	1
you,	1
trust	1
to	1
me,"	1
said	1
Hardy:	1
and	1
he	1
left	1
the	1
room,	1
and	1
Loveit	1
stood	1
in	1
amazement;	1
while,	1
in	1
the	1
meantime,	1
Hardy,	1
in	1
hopes	1
of	1
overtaking	1
Tom	1
before	1
the	1
fate	1
of	1
the	1
poor	1
dog	1
was	1
decided,	1
ran	1
with	1
all	1
possible	1
speed	1
across	1
the	1
meadow,	1
then	1
down	1
the	1
lane.	1
He	1
came	1
up	1
with	1
Tom	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
climbing	1
the	1
bank	1
into	1
the	1
old	1
man's	1
garden.	1
Hardy,	1
too	1
much	1
out	1
of	1
breath	1
to	1
speak,	1
seized	1
hold	1
of	1
him,	1
dragged	1
him	1
down,	1
detaining	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
firm	1
grasp,	1
whilst	1
he	1
panted	1
for	1
utterance.	1
"What,	1
Master	1
Hardy,	1
is	1
it	1
you?	1
what's	1
the	1
matter?	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
want?"	1
"I	1
want	1
the	1
poisoned	1
meat	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
in	1
your	1
pocket."	1
"Who	1
told	1
you	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
any	1
such	1
thing?"	1
said	1
Tom,	1
clapping	1
his	1
hand	1
upon	1
his	1
guilty	1
pocket.	1
"Give	1
it	1
me	1
quietly,	1
and	1
I'll	1
let	1
you	1
off."	1
"Sir,	1
upon	1
my	1
word	1
I	1
haven't!	1
I	1
didn't!	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
what	1
you	1
mean,"	1
said	1
Tom,	1
trembling,	1
though	1
he	1
was	1
by	1
far	1
the	1
stronger	1
of	1
the	1
two.	1
"Indeed,	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
what	1
you	1
mean."	1
"You	1
do,"	1
said	1
Hardy,	1
with	1
great	1
indignation:	1
and	1
a	1
violent	1
struggle	1
immediately	1
commenced.	1
The	1
dog,	1
now	1
alarmed	1
by	1
the	1
voices,	1
began	1
to	1
bark	1
outrageously.	1
Tom	1
was	1
terrified	1
lest	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
should	1
come	1
out	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
matter;	1
his	1
strength	1
forsook	1
him,	1
and	1
flinging	1
the	1
handkerchief	1
and	1
meat	1
over	1
the	1
hedge,	1
he	1
ran	1
away	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
speed.	1
The	1
handkerchief	1
fell	1
within	1
reach	1
of	1
the	1
dog,	1
who	1
instantly	1
snapped	1
at	1
it;	1
luckily	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
come	1
untied.	1
Hardy	1
saw	1
a	1
pitchfork	1
on	1
a	1
dunghill	1
close	1
beside	1
him,	1
and,	1
seizing	1
upon	1
it,	1
stuck	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
handkerchief.	1
The	1
dog	1
pulled,	1
tore,	1
growled,	1
grappled,	1
yelled;	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
get	1
the	1
handkerchief	1
from	1
between	1
his	1
teeth;	1
but	1
the	1
knot	1
was	1
loosed,	1
the	1
meat,	1
unperceived	1
by	1
the	1
dog,	1
dropped	1
out,	1
and	1
while	1
he	1
dragged	1
off	1
the	1
handkerchief	1
in	1
triumph,	1
Hardy,	1
with	1
inexpressible	1
joy,	1
plunged	1
the	1
pitchfork	1
into	1
the	1
poisoned	1
meat,	1
and	1
bore	1
it	1
away.	1
Never	1
did	1
hero	1
retire	1
with	1
more	1
satisfaction	1
from	1
a	1
field	1
of	1
battle.	1
Full	1
of	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
successful	1
benevolence,	1
Hardy	1
tripped	1
joyfully	1
home,	1
and	1
vaulted	1
over	1
the	1
window	1
sill,	1
when	1
the	1
first	1
object	1
he	1
beheld	1
was	1
Mr.	1
Power,	1
the	1
usher,	1
standing	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
stairs,	1
with	1
his	1
candle	1
in	1
his	1
hand.	1
"Come	1
up,	1
whoever	1
you	1
are,"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
William	1
Power,	1
in	1
a	1
stern	1
voice.	1
"I	1
thought	1
I	1
should	1
find	1
you	1
out	1
at	1
last.	1
Come	1
up,	1
whoever	1
you	1
are!"	1
Hardy	1
obeyed	1
without	1
reply.--"Hardy!"	1
exclaimed	1
Mr.	1
Power,	1
starting	1
back	1
with	1
astonishment;	1
"is	1
it	1
you,	1
Mr.	1
Hardy?"	1
repeated	1
he,	1
holding	1
the	1
light	1
to	1
his	1
face.	1
"Why,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
he,	1
in	1
a	1
sneering	1
tone,	1
"I'm	1
sure	1
if	1
Mr.	1
Trueman	1
was	1
here	1
he	1
wouldn't	1
believe	1
his	1
own	1
eyes;	1
but	1
for	1
my	1
part	1
I	1
saw	1
through	1
you	1
long	1
since;	1
I	1
never	1
liked	1
saints,	1
for	1
my	1
share.	1
Will	1
you	1
please	1
to	1
do	1
me	1
the	1
favour,	1
sir,	1
if	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
too	1
much	1
trouble,	1
to	1
empty	1
your	1
pockets."	1
Hardy	1
obeyed	1
in	1
silence.	1
"Heyday!	1
meat!	1
raw	1
meat!	1
what	1
next?"	1
"That's	1
all,"	1
said	1
Hardy,	1
emptying	1
his	1
pockets	1
inside	1
out.	1
"This	1
is	1
ALL,"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Power,	1
taking	1
up	1
the	1
meat.	1
"Pray,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
Hardy,	1
eagerly,	1
"let	1
that	1
meat	1
be	1
burned,	1
it	1
is	1
poisoned."	1
"Poisoned!"	1
cried	1
Mr.	1
William	1
Power,	1
letting	1
it	1
drop	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
fingers;	1
"you	1
wretch!"	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
menacing	1
air:	1
"what	1
is	1
all	1
this?	1
Speak."	1
Hardy	1
was	1
silent.	1
"Why	1
don't	1
you	1
speak?"	1
cried	1
he,	1
shaking	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
shoulder	1
impatiently.	1
Still	1
Hardy	1
was	1
silent.	1
"Down	1
upon	1
your	1
knees	1
this	1
minute	1
and	1
confess	1
all:	1
tell	1
me	1
where	1
you've	1
been,	1
what	1
you've	1
been	1
doing,	1
and	1
who	1
are	1
your	1
accomplices,	1
for	1
I	1
know	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
gang	1
of	1
you;	1
so,"	1
added	1
he,	1
pressing	1
heavily	1
upon	1
Hardy's	1
shoulder,	1
"down	1
upon	1
your	1
knees	1
this	1
minute,	1
and	1
confess	1
the	1
whole,	1
that's	1
your	1
only	1
way	1
now	1
to	1
get	1
off	1
yourself.	1
If	1
you	1
hope	1
for	1
MY	1
pardon,	1
I	1
can	1
tell	1
you	1
it's	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
had	1
without	1
asking	1
for."	1
"Sir,"	1
said	1
Hardy,	1
in	1
a	1
firm	1
but	1
respectful	1
voice,	1
"I	1
have	1
no	1
pardon	1
to	1
ask,	1
I	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
confess;	1
I	1
am	1
innocent;	1
but	1
if	1
I	1
were	1
not,	1
I	1
would	1
never	1
try	1
to	1
get	1
off	1
myself	1
by	1
betraying	1
my	1
companions."	1
"Very	1
well,	1
sir!	1
very	1
well!	1
very	1
fine!	1
stick	1
to	1
it,	1
stick	1
to	1
it,	1
I	1
advise	1
you,	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
see.	1
And	1
how	1
will	1
you	1
look	1
to-morrow,	1
Mr.	1
Innocent,	1
when	1
my	1
uncle,	1
the	1
doctor,	1
comes	1
home?"	1
"As	1
I	1
do	1
now,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
Hardy,	1
unmoved.	1
His	1
composure	1
threw	1
Mr.	1
Power	1
into	1
a	1
rage	1
too	1
great	1
for	1
utterance.	1
"Sir,"	1
continued	1
Hardy,	1
"ever	1
since	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
at	1
school,	1
I	1
never	1
told	1
a	1
lie,	1
and	1
therefore,	1
sir,	1
I	1
hope	1
you	1
will	1
believe	1
me	1
now.	1
Upon	1
my	1
word	1
and	1
honour,	1
sir,	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
nothing	1
wrong."	1
"Nothing	1
wrong?	1
Better	1
and	1
better!	1
what,	1
when	1
I	1
caught	1
you	1
going	1
out	1
at	1
night?"	1
"THAT,	1
to	1
be	1
sure,	1
was	1
wrong,"	1
said	1
Hardy,	1
recollecting	1
himself;	1
"but	1
except	1
that--"	1
"Except	1
that,	1
sir!	1
I	1
will	1
except	1
nothing.	1
Come	1
along	1
with	1
me,	1
young	1
gentleman,	1
your	1
time	1
for	1
pardon	1
is	1
past."	1
Saying	1
these	1
words,	1
he	1
pulled	1
Hardy	1
along	1
a	1
narrow	1
passage	1
to	1
a	1
small	1
closet,	1
set	1
apart	1
for	1
desperate	1
offenders,	1
and	1
usually	1
known	1
by	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
BLACK	1
HOLE.	1
"There,	1
sir,	1
take	1
up	1
your	1
lodging	1
there	1
for	1
to-	1
night,"	1
said	1
he,	1
pushing	1
him	1
in;	1
"tomorrow	1
I'll	1
know	1
more,	1
or	1
I'll	1
know	1
why,"	1
added	1
he,	1
double	1
locking	1
the	1
door,	1
with	1
a	1
tremendous	1
noise,	1
upon	1
his	1
prisoner,	1
and	1
locking	1
also	1
the	1
door	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
passage,	1
so	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
could	1
have	1
access	1
to	1
him.	1
"So	1
now	1
I	1
think	1
I	1
have	1
you	1
safe!"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
William	1
Power	1
to	1
himself,	1
stalking	1
off	1
with	1
steps	1
which	1
made	1
the	1
whole	1
gallery	1
resound,	1
and	1
which	1
made	1
many	1
a	1
guilty	1
heart	1
tremble.	1
The	1
conversation	1
which	1
had	1
passed	1
between	1
Hardy	1
and	1
Mr.	1
Power	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
stairs	1
had	1
been	1
anxiously	1
listened	1
to;	1
but	1
only	1
a	1
word	1
or	1
two	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
distinctly	1
overheard.	1
The	1
locking	1
of	1
the	1
black	1
hole	1
door	1
was	1
a	1
terrible	1
sound--some	1
knew	1
not	1
what	1
it	1
portended,	1
and	1
others	1
knew	1
TOO	1
WELL.	1
All	1
assembled	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
with	1
faces	1
of	1
anxiety.	1
Tarlton	1
and	1
Loveit's	1
were	1
the	1
most	1
agitated:	1
Tarlton	1
for	1
himself,	1
Loveit	1
for	1
his	1
friend,	1
for	1
himself,	1
for	1
everybody.	1
Every	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
party,	1
and	1
Tarlton	1
at	1
their	1
head,	1
surrounded	1
him	1
with	1
reproaches;	1
and	1
considered	1
him	1
as	1
the	1
author	1
of	1
the	1
evils	1
which	1
hung	1
over	1
them.	1
"How	1
could	1
you	1
do	1
so?	1
and	1
why	1
did	1
you	1
say	1
anything	1
to	1
Hardy	1
about	1
it?	1
when	1
you	1
had	1
promised,	1
too!	1
Oh!	1
what	1
shall	1
we	1
all	1
do?	1
what	1
a	1
scrape	1
you	1
have	1
brought	1
us	1
into,	1
Loveit,	1
it's	1
all	1
your	1
fault!"	1
"ALL	1
MY	1
FAULT!"	1
repeated	1
poor	1
Loveit,	1
with	1
a	1
sigh;	1
"well,	1
that	1
is	1
hard."	1
"Goodness!	1
there's	1
the	1
bell,"	1
exclaimed	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
voices	1
at	1
once.	1
"Now	1
for	1
it!"	1
They	1
all	1
stood	1
in	1
a	1
half	1
circle	1
for	1
morning	1
prayers.	1
They	1
listened--"Here	1
he	1
is	1
coming!	1
No--Yes--Here	1
he	1
is!"	1
And	1
Mr.	1
William	1
Power,	1
with	1
a	1
gloomy	1
brow,	1
appeared	1
and	1
walked	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
place	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
room.	1
They	1
knelt	1
down	1
to	1
prayers,	1
and	1
the	1
moment	1
they	1
rose,	1
Mr.	1
William	1
Power,	1
laying	1
his	1
hand	1
upon	1
the	1
table,	1
cried,	1
"Stand	1
still,	1
gentlemen,	1
if	1
you	1
please."	1
Everybody	1
stood	1
stock	1
still;	1
he	1
walked	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
circle;	1
they	1
guessed	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
gone	1
for	1
Hardy,	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
room	1
was	1
in	1
commotion.	1
Each	1
with	1
eagerness	1
asked	1
each	1
what	1
none	1
could	1
answer,	1
"HAS	1
HE	1
TOLD?"	1
"WHAT	1
has	1
he	1
told?"	1
"Who	1
has	1
he	1
told	1
of?"	1
"I	1
hope	1
he	1
has	1
not	1
told	1
of	1
me,"	1
cried	1
they.	1
"I'll	1
answer	1
for	1
it	1
he	1
has	1
told	1
of	1
all	1
of	1
us,"	1
said	1
Tarlton.	1
"And	1
I'll	1
answer	1
for	1
it	1
he	1
has	1
told	1
of	1
none	1
of	1
us,"	1
answered	1
Loveit,	1
with	1
a	1
sigh.	1
"You	1
don't	1
think	1
he's	1
such	1
a	1
fool,	1
when	1
he	1
can	1
get	1
himself	1
off,"	1
said	1
Tarlton.	1
At	1
this	1
instant	1
the	1
prisoner	1
was	1
led	1
in,	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
passed	1
through	1
the	1
circle,	1
every	1
eye	1
was	1
fixed	1
upon	1
him.	1
His	1
eye	1
fell	1
upon	1
no	1
one,	1
not	1
even	1
upon	1
Loveit,	1
who	1
pulled	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
coat	1
as	1
he	1
passed--everyone	1
felt	1
almost	1
afraid	1
to	1
breathe.	1
"Well,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Power,	1
sitting	1
down	1
in	1
Mr.	1
Trueman's	1
elbow-chair,	1
and	1
placing	1
the	1
prisoner	1
opposite	1
to	1
him;	1
"well,	1
sir,	1
what	1
have	1
you	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
me	1
this	1
morning?"	1
"Nothing,	1
sir,"	1
answered	1
Hardy,	1
in	1
a	1
decided,	1
yet	1
modest	1
manner;	1
"nothing	1
but	1
what	1
I	1
said	1
last	1
night."	1
"Nothing	1
more?"	1
"Nothing	1
more,	1
sir."	1
"But	1
I	1
have	1
something	1
more	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
you,	1
sir,	1
then;	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
more,	1
I	1
promise	1
you,	1
before	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
with	1
you;"	1
and	1
then,	1
seizing	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
fury,	1
he	1
was	1
just	1
going	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
a	1
severe	1
flogging,	1
when	1
the	1
schoolroom	1
door	1
opened,	1
and	1
Mr.	1
Trueman	1
appeared,	1
followed	1
by	1
an	1
old	1
man	1
whom	1
Loveit	1
immediately	1
knew.	1
He	1
leaned	1
upon	1
his	1
stick	1
as	1
he	1
walked,	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
other	1
hand	1
carried	1
a	1
basket	1
of	1
apples.	1
When	1
they	1
came	1
within	1
the	1
circle,	1
Mr.	1
Trueman	1
stopped	1
short.	1
"Hardy!"	1
exclaimed	1
he,	1
with	1
a	1
voice	1
of	1
unfeigned	1
surprise,	1
whilst	1
Mr.	1
William	1
Power	1
stood	1
with	1
his	1
hand	1
suspended.--"Ay,	1
Hardy,	1
sir,"	1
repeated	1
he.	1
"I	1
told	1
him	1
you'd	1
not	1
believe	1
your	1
own	1
eyes."	1
Mr.	1
Trueman	1
advanced	1
with	1
a	1
slow	1
step.	1
"Now,	1
sir,	1
give	1
me	1
leave,"	1
said	1
the	1
usher,	1
eagerly	1
drawing	1
him	1
aside,	1
and	1
whispering.	1
"So,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
T.	1
when	1
the	1
whisper	1
was	1
done,	1
addressing	1
himself	1
to	1
Hardy,	1
with	1
a	1
voice	1
and	1
manner	1
which,	1
had	1
he	1
been	1
guilty,	1
must	1
have	1
pierced	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
heart,	1
"I	1
find	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
deceived	1
in	1
you;	1
it	1
is	1
but	1
three	1
hours	1
ago	1
that	1
I	1
told	1
your	1
uncle	1
I	1
never	1
had	1
a	1
boy	1
in	1
my	1
school	1
in	1
whom	1
I	1
placed	1
so	1
much	1
confidence;	1
but,	1
after	1
all	1
this	1
show	1
of	1
honour	1
and	1
integrity,	1
the	1
moment	1
my	1
back	1
is	1
turned,	1
you	1
are	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
set	1
an	1
example	1
of	1
disobedience	1
of	1
my	1
orders.	1
Why	1
do	1
I	1
talk	1
of	1
disobeying	1
my	1
commands--you	1
are	1
a	1
thief!"	1
"I,	1
sir?"	1
exclaimed	1
Hardy,	1
no	1
longer	1
able	1
to	1
repress	1
his	1
feelings.	1
"You,	1
sir,--you	1
and	1
some	1
others,"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Trueman,	1
looking	1
round	1
the	1
room	1
with	1
a	1
penetrating	1
glance--"you	1
and	1
some	1
others."	1
"Ay,	1
sir,"	1
interrupted	1
Mr.	1
William	1
Power,	1
"get	1
that	1
out	1
of	1
him	1
if	1
you	1
can--ask	1
him."	1
"I	1
will	1
ask	1
him	1
nothing;	1
I	1
shall	1
neither	1
put	1
his	1
truth	1
nor	1
his	1
honour	1
to	1
the	1
trial;	1
truth	1
and	1
honour	1
are	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
expected	1
amongst	1
thieves."	1
"I	1
am	1
not	1
a	1
thief!	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
had	1
anything	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
thieves,"	1
cried	1
Hardy,	1
indignantly.	1
"Have	1
you	1
not	1
robbed	1
this	1
old	1
man?	1
Don't	1
you	1
know	1
the	1
taste	1
of	1
these	1
apples?"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Trueman,	1
taking	1
one	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
basket.	1
"No,	1
sir;	1
I	1
do	1
not.	1
I	1
never	1
touched	1
one	1
of	1
that	1
old	1
man's	1
apples."	1
"Never	1
touched	1
one	1
of	1
them!	1
I	1
suppose	1
this	1
is	1
some	1
vile	1
equivocation;	1
you	1
have	1
done	1
worse,	1
you	1
have	1
had	1
the	1
barbarity,	1
the	1
baseness,	1
to	1
attempt	1
to	1
poison	1
his	1
dog;	1
the	1
poisoned	1
meat	1
was	1
found	1
in	1
your	1
pocket	1
last	1
night."	1
"The	1
poisoned	1
meat	1
was	1
found	1
in	1
my	1
pocket,	1
sir;	1
but	1
I	1
never	1
intended	1
to	1
poison	1
the	1
dog--I	1
saved	1
his	1
life."	1
"Lord	1
bless	1
him!"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
man.	1
"Nonsense--cunning!"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Power.	1
"I	1
hope	1
you	1
won't	1
let	1
him	1
impose	1
upon	1
you,	1
sir."	1
"No,	1
he	1
cannot	1
impose	1
upon	1
me;	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
proof	1
he	1
is	1
little	1
prepared	1
for,"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Trueman,	1
producing	1
the	1
blue	1
handkerchief	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
meat	1
had	1
been	1
wrapped.	1
Tarlton	1
turned	1
pale;	1
Hardy's	1
countenance	1
never	1
changed.	1
"Don't	1
you	1
know	1
this	1
handkerchief,	1
sir?"	1
"I	1
do,	1
sir."	1
"Is	1
it	1
not	1
yours?"	1
"No,	1
sir."	1
"Don't	1
you	1
know	1
whose	1
it	1
is?"	1
cried	1
Mr.	1
Power.	1
Hardy	1
was	1
silent.	1
"Now,	1
gentlemen,"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Trueman,	1
"I	1
am	1
not	1
fond	1
of	1
punishing	1
you;	1
but	1
when	1
I	1
do	1
it,	1
you	1
know,	1
it	1
is	1
always	1
in	1
earnest.	1
I	1
will	1
begin	1
with	1
the	1
eldest	1
of	1
you;	1
I	1
will	1
begin	1
with	1
Hardy,	1
and	1
flog	1
you	1
with	1
my	1
own	1
hands	1
till	1
this	1
handkerchief	1
is	1
owned."	1
"I'm	1
sure	1
it's	1
not	1
mine,"	1
and	1
"I'm	1
sure	1
it's	1
none	1
of	1
mine,"	1
burst	1
from	1
every	1
mouth,	1
whilst	1
they	1
looked	1
at	1
each	1
other	1
in	1
dismay;	1
for	1
none	1
but	1
Hardy,	1
Loveit	1
and	1
Tarlton	1
knew	1
the	1
secret.	1
"My	1
cane,"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Trueman,	1
and	1
Mr.	1
Power	1
handed	1
him	1
the	1
cane.	1
Loveit	1
groaned	1
from	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
his	1
heart.	1
Tarlton	1
leaned	1
back	1
against	1
the	1
wall	1
with	1
a	1
black	1
countenance.	1
Hardy	1
looked	1
with	1
a	1
steady	1
eye	1
at	1
the	1
cane.	1
"But	1
first,"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Trueman,	1
laying	1
down	1
the	1
cane,	1
"let	1
us	1
see.	1
Perhaps	1
we	1
may	1
find	1
out	1
the	1
owner	1
of	1
this	1
handkerchief	1
another	1
way,"	1
examining	1
the	1
corners.	1
It	1
was	1
torn	1
almost	1
to	1
pieces;	1
but	1
luckily	1
the	1
corner	1
that	1
was	1
marked	1
remained.	1
"J.	1
T.!"	1
cried	1
Mr.	1
Trueman.	1
Every	1
eye	1
turned	1
upon	1
the	1
guilty	1
Tarlton,	1
who,	1
now	1
as	1
pale	1
as	1
ashes	1
and	1
trembling	1
in	1
every	1
limb,	1
sank	1
down	1
upon	1
his	1
knees,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
whining	1
voice	1
begged	1
for	1
mercy.	1
"Upon	1
my	1
word	1
and	1
honour,	1
sir,	1
I'll	1
tell	1
you	1
all;	1
I'd	1
never	1
have	1
thought	1
of	1
stealing	1
the	1
apples	1
if	1
Loveit	1
had	1
not	1
first	1
told	1
me	1
of	1
them;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
Tom	1
who	1
first	1
put	1
the	1
poisoning	1
the	1
dog	1
into	1
my	1
head.	1
It	1
was	1
he	1
that	1
carried	1
the	1
meat,	1
WASN'T	1
IT?"	1
said	1
he,	1
appealing	1
to	1
Hardy,	1
whose	1
word	1
he	1
knew	1
must	1
be	1
believed.	1
"Oh,	1
dear	1
sir!"	1
continued	1
he	1
as	1
Mr.	1
Trueman	1
began	1
to	1
move	1
towards	1
him,	1
"do	1
let	1
me	1
off;	1
pray	1
do	1
let	1
me	1
off	1
this	1
time!	1
I'm	1
not	1
the	1
only	1
one,	1
indeed,	1
sir!	1
I	1
hope	1
you	1
won't	1
make	1
me	1
an	1
example	1
for	1
the	1
rest.	1
It's	1
very	1
hard	1
I'm	1
to	1
be	1
flogged	1
more	1
than	1
they!"	1
"I'm	1
not	1
going	1
to	1
flog	1
you."	1
"Thank	1
you,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
Tarlton,	1
getting	1
up	1
and	1
wiping	1
his	1
eyes.	1
"You	1
need	1
not	1
thank	1
me,"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Trueman.	1
"Take	1
your	1
handkerchief--go	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
room--out	1
of	1
this	1
house;	1
let	1
me	1
never	1
see	1
you	1
more."	1
"If	1
I	1
had	1
any	1
hopes	1
of	1
him,"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Trueman,	1
as	1
he	1
shut	1
the	1
door	1
after	1
him;--"if	1
I	1
had	1
any	1
hopes	1
of	1
him,	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
punished	1
him;--but	1
I	1
have	1
none.	1
Punishment	1
is	1
meant	1
only	1
to	1
make	1
people	1
better;	1
and	1
those	1
who	1
have	1
any	1
hopes	1
of	1
themselves	1
will	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
submit	1
to	1
it."	1
At	1
these	1
words	1
Loveit	1
first,	1
and	1
immediately	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
guilty	1
party,	1
stepped	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
ranks,	1
confessed	1
their	1
fault,	1
and	1
declared	1
themselves	1
ready	1
to	1
bear	1
any	1
punishment	1
their	1
master	1
thought	1
proper.	1
"Oh,	1
they	1
have	1
been	1
punished	1
enough,"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
man;	1
"forgive	1
them,	1
sir."	1
Hardy	1
looked	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
speak.	1
"Not	1
because	1
you	1
ask	1
it,"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Trueman	1
to	1
the	1
guilty	1
penitents,	1
"though	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
glad	1
to	1
oblige	1
you--it	1
wouldn't	1
be	1
just;	1
but	1
there,"	1
pointing	1
to	1
Hardy,	1
"there	1
is	1
one	1
who	1
has	1
merited	1
a	1
reward;	1
the	1
highest	1
I	1
can	1
give	1
him	1
is	1
that	1
of	1
pardoning	1
his	1
companions."	1
Hardy	1
bowed	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
glowed	1
with	1
pleasure,	1
whilst	1
everybody	1
present	1
sympathized	1
in	1
his	1
feelings.	1
"I	1
am	1
sure,"	1
thought	1
Loveit,	1
"this	1
is	1
a	1
lesson	1
I	1
shall	1
never	1
forget."	1
"Gentlemen,"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
man,	1
with	1
a	1
faltering	1
voice,	1
"it	1
wasn't	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
my	1
apples	1
that	1
I	1
spoke;	1
and	1
you,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
Hardy,	1
"I	1
thank	1
you	1
for	1
saving	1
my	1
dog.	1
If	1
you	1
please,	1
I'll	1
plant	1
on	1
that	1
mount,	1
opposite	1
the	1
window,	1
a	1
young	1
apple-tree,	1
from	1
my	1
old	1
one.	1
I	1
will	1
water	1
it,	1
and	1
take	1
care	1
of	1
it	1
with	1
my	1
own	1
hands	1
for	1
your	1
sake,	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
able.	1
And	1
may	1
God	1
bless	1
you!"	1
laying	1
his	1
trembling	1
hand	1
on	1
Hardy's	1
head;	1
"may	1
God	1
bless	1
you--I'm	1
sure	1
God	1
WILL	1
bless	1
all	1
such	1
boys	1
as	1
you	1
are."	1

At	1
the	1
foot	1
of	1
a	1
steep,	1
slippery,	1
white	1
hill,	1
near	1
Dunstable,	1
in	1
Bedfordshire,	1
called	1
Chalk	1
Hill,	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
hut,	1
or	1
rather	1
a	1
hovel,	1
which	1
travellers	1
could	1
scarcely	1
suppose	1
could	1
be	1
inhabited,	1
if	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
the	1
smoke	1
rising	1
from	1
its	1
peaked	1
roof.	1
An	1
old	1
woman	1
lives	1
in	1
this	1
hovel,	1
**	1
and	1
with	1
her	1
a	1
little	1
boy	1
and	1
girl,	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
a	1
beggar	1
who	1
died,	1
and	1
left	1
these	1
orphans	1
perishing	1
with	1
hunger.	1
They	1
thought	1
themselves	1
very	1
happy	1
when	1
the	1
good	1
old	1
woman	1
first	1
took	1
them	1
into	1
her	1
hut	1
and	1
bid	1
them	1
warm	1
themselves	1
at	1
her	1
small	1
fire,	1
and	1
gave	1
them	1
a	1
crust	1
of	1
mouldy	1
bread	1
to	1
eat.	1
She	1
had	1
not	1
much	1
to	1
give,	1
but	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
she	1
gave	1
with	1
good-will.	1
She	1
was	1
very	1
kind	1
to	1
these	1
poor	1
children,	1
and	1
worked	1
hard	1
at	1
her	1
spinning-wheel	1
and	1
at	1
her	1
knitting,	1
to	1
support	1
herself	1
and	1
them.	1
She	1
earned	1
money	1
also	1
in	1
another	1
way.	1
She	1
used	1
to	1
follow	1
all	1
the	1
carriages	1
as	1
they	1
went	1
up	1
Chalk	1
Hill,	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
horses	1
stopped	1
to	1
take	1
breath	1
or	1
to	1
rest	1
themselves,	1
she	1
put	1
stones	1
behind	1
the	1
carriage	1
wheels	1
to	1
prevent	1
them	1
from	1
rolling	1
backwards	1
down	1
the	1
steep,	1
slippery	1
hill.	1
*	1
"Their	1
whole	1
study	1
was	1
how	1
to	1
please	1
and	1
to	1
help	1
one	1
another."	1
**	1
This	1
was	1
about	1
the	1
close	1
of	1
the	1
18th	1
century.	1
The	1
little	1
boy	1
and	1
girl	1
loved	1
to	1
stand	1
beside	1
the	1
good	1
natured	1
old	1
woman's	1
spinning-wheel	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
spinning,	1
and	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
her.	1
At	1
these	1
times	1
she	1
taught	1
them	1
something,	1
which,	1
she	1
said,	1
she	1
hoped	1
they	1
would	1
remember	1
all	1
their	1
lives.	1
She	1
explained	1
to	1
them	1
what	1
is	1
meant	1
by	1
telling	1
the	1
truth,	1
and	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
honest.	1
She	1
taught	1
them	1
to	1
dislike	1
idleness,	1
and	1
to	1
wish	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
be	1
useful.	1
One	1
evening,	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
standing	1
beside	1
her,	1
the	1
little	1
boy	1
said	1
to	1
her,	1
"Grandmother,"	1
for	1
that	1
was	1
the	1
name	1
by	1
which	1
she	1
liked	1
that	1
these	1
children	1
should	1
call	1
her--"grandmother,	1
how	1
often	1
you	1
are	1
forced	1
to	1
get	1
up	1
from	1
your	1
spinning-wheel,	1
and	1
to	1
follow	1
the	1
chaises	1
and	1
coaches	1
up	1
that	1
steep	1
hill,	1
to	1
put	1
stones	1
underneath	1
the	1
wheels,	1
to	1
hinder	1
them	1
from	1
rolling	1
back!	1
The	1
people	1
who	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
carriages	1
give	1
you	1
a	1
halfpenny	1
or	1
a	1
penny	1
for	1
doing	1
this,	1
don't	1
they?"	1
"Yes,	1
child."	1
"But	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
hard	1
work	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
go	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
that	1
hill.	1
You	1
often	1
say	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
tired,	1
and	1
then	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
you	1
cannot	1
spin	1
all	1
that	1
time.	1
Now	1
if	1
we	1
might	1
go	1
up	1
the	1
hill,	1
and	1
put	1
the	1
stones	1
behind	1
the	1
wheels,	1
you	1
could	1
sit	1
still	1
at	1
your	1
work,	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
the	1
people	1
give	1
us	1
the	1
halfpence?	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
we	1
bring	1
them	1
all	1
to	1
you?	1
Do,	1
pray,	1
dear	1
grandmother,	1
try	1
us	1
for	1
one	1
day--to-morrow,	1
will	1
you?"	1
"Yes,"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
woman;	1
"I	1
will	1
try	1
what	1
you	1
can	1
do;	1
but	1
I	1
must	1
go	1
up	1
the	1
hill	1
along	1
with	1
you	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
times,	1
for	1
fear	1
you	1
should	1
get	1
yourselves	1
hurt."	1
So,	1
the	1
next	1
day,	1
the	1
little	1
boy	1
and	1
girl	1
went	1
with	1
their	1
grandmother,	1
as	1
they	1
used	1
to	1
call	1
her,	1
up	1
the	1
steep	1
hill;	1
and	1
she	1
showed	1
the	1
boy	1
how	1
to	1
prevent	1
the	1
wheels	1
from	1
rolling	1
back,	1
by	1
putting	1
stones	1
behind	1
them;	1
and	1
she	1
said,	1
"This	1
is	1
called	1
scotching	1
the	1
wheels;"	1
and	1
she	1
took	1
off	1
the	1
boy's	1
hat	1
and	1
gave	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
little	1
girl,	1
to	1
hold	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
carriage-	1
windows,	1
ready	1
for	1
the	1
halfpence.	1
When	1
she	1
thought	1
that	1
the	1
children	1
knew	1
how	1
to	1
manage	1
by	1
themselves,	1
she	1
left	1
them,	1
and	1
returned	1
to	1
her	1
spinning-wheel.	1
A	1
great	1
many	1
carriages	1
happened	1
to	1
go	1
by	1
this	1
day,	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
girl	1
received	1
a	1
great	1
many	1
halfpence.	1
She	1
carried	1
them	1
all	1
in	1
her	1
brother's	1
hat	1
to	1
her	1
grandmother	1
in	1
the	1
evening;	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
woman	1
smiled,	1
and	1
thanked	1
the	1
children.	1
She	1
said	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
useful	1
to	1
her,	1
and	1
that	1
her	1
spinning	1
had	1
gone	1
on	1
finely,	1
because	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
sit	1
still	1
at	1
her	1
wheel	1
all	1
day.	1
"But,	1
Paul	1
my	1
boy,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"what	1
is	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
your	1
hand?"	1
"Only	1
a	1
pinch--only	1
one	1
pinch	1
that	1
I	1
got,	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
putting	1
a	1
stone	1
behind	1
a	1
wheel	1
of	1
a	1
chaise.	1
It	1
does	1
not	1
hurt	1
me	1
much,	1
grandmother;	1
and	1
I've	1
thought	1
of	1
a	1
good	1
thing	1
for	1
to-morrow.	1
I	1
shall	1
never	1
be	1
hurt	1
again,	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
only	1
be	1
so	1
good	1
as	1
to	1
give	1
me	1
the	1
old	1
handle	1
of	1
the	1
broken	1
crutch,	1
grandmother,	1
and	1
the	1
block	1
of	1
wood	1
that	1
lies	1
in	1
the	1
chimney-	1
corner,	1
and	1
that	1
is	1
of	1
no	1
use.	1
I'll	1
make	1
it	1
of	1
some	1
use,	1
if	1
I	1
may	1
have	1
it."	1
"Take	1
it	1
then,	1
dear,"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
woman;	1
"and	1
you'll	1
find	1
the	1
handle	1
of	1
the	1
broken	1
crutch	1
under	1
my	1
bed."	1
Paul	1
went	1
to	1
work	1
immediately,	1
and	1
fastened	1
one	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
pole	1
into	1
the	1
block	1
of	1
wood,	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
make	1
something	1
like	1
a	1
dry-rubbing	1
brush.	1
"Look,	1
grandmamma,	1
look	1
at	1
my	1
SCOTCHER.	1
I	1
call	1
this	1
thing	1
my	1
SCOTCHER,"	1
said	1
Paul,	1
"because	1
I	1
shall	1
always	1
scotch	1
the	1
wheels	1
with	1
it.	1
I	1
shall	1
never	1
pinch	1
my	1
fingers	1
again;	1
my	1
hands,	1
you	1
see,	1
will	1
be	1
safe	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
this	1
long	1
stick;	1
and,	1
sister	1
Anne,	1
you	1
need	1
not	1
be	1
at	1
the	1
trouble	1
of	1
carrying	1
any	1
more	1
stones	1
after	1
me	1
up	1
the	1
hill;	1
we	1
shall	1
never	1
want	1
stones	1
any	1
more.	1
My	1
scotcher	1
will	1
do	1
without	1
anything	1
else,	1
I	1
hope.	1
I	1
wish	1
it	1
was	1
morning,	1
and	1
that	1
a	1
carriage	1
would	1
come,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
run	1
up	1
the	1
hill,	1
and	1
try	1
my	1
scotcher."	1
"And	1
I	1
wish	1
that	1
as	1
many	1
chaises	1
may	1
go	1
by	1
to-morrow	1
as	1
there	1
did	1
to-day,	1
and	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
bring	1
you	1
as	1
many	1
halfpence,	1
grandmother,"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
girl.	1
"So	1
do	1
I,	1
my	1
dear	1
Anne,"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
woman;	1
"for	1
I	1
mean	1
that	1
you	1
and	1
your	1
brother	1
shall	1
have	1
all	1
the	1
money	1
that	1
you	1
get	1
to-morrow.	1
You	1
may	1
buy	1
some	1
gingerbread	1
for	1
yourselves,	1
or	1
some	1
of	1
those	1
ripe	1
plums	1
that	1
you	1
saw	1
at	1
the	1
fruit-stall	1
the	1
other	1
day,	1
which	1
is	1
just	1
going	1
into	1
Dunstable.	1
I	1
told	1
you	1
then	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
afford	1
to	1
buy	1
such	1
things	1
for	1
you;	1
but	1
now	1
that	1
you	1
can	1
earn	1
halfpence	1
for	1
yourselves,	1
children,	1
it	1
is	1
fair	1
should	1
taste	1
a	1
ripe	1
plum	1
and	1
bit	1
of	1
gingerbread	1
for	1
once	1
and	1
a	1
way	1
in	1
your	1
lives."	1
"We'll	1
bring	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
gingerbread	1
home	1
to	1
her,	1
shan't	1
we,	1
brother?"	1
whispered	1
little	1
Anne.	1
The	1
morning	1
came;	1
but	1
no	1
carriages	1
were	1
heard,	1
though	1
Paul	1
and	1
his	1
sister	1
had	1
risen	1
at	1
five	1
o'clock,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
sure	1
to	1
be	1
ready	1
for	1
early	1
travellers.	1
Paul	1
kept	1
his	1
scotcher	1
poised	1
upon	1
his	1
shoulder,	1
and	1
watched	1
eagerly	1
at	1
his	1
station	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
hill.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
wait	1
long	1
before	1
a	1
carriage	1
came.	1
He	1
followed	1
it	1
up	1
the	1
hill;	1
and	1
the	1
instant	1
the	1
postillion	1
called	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
bid	1
him	1
stop	1
the	1
wheels,	1
he	1
put	1
his	1
scotcher	1
behind	1
them,	1
and	1
found	1
that	1
it	1
answered	1
the	1
purpose	1
perfectly	1
well.	1
Many	1
carriages	1
went	1
by	1
this	1
day,	1
and	1
Paul	1
and	1
Anne	1
received	1
a	1
great	1
many	1
halfpence	1
from	1
the	1
travellers.	1
When	1
it	1
grew	1
dusk	1
in	1
the	1
evening,	1
Anne	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
brother--"I	1
don't	1
think	1
any	1
more	1
carriages	1
will	1
come	1
by	1
to-day.	1
Let	1
us	1
count	1
the	1
halfpence,	1
and	1
carry	1
them	1
home	1
now	1
to	1
grandmother."	1
"No,	1
not	1
yet,"	1
answered	1
Paul,	1
"let	1
them	1
alone--let	1
them	1
lie	1
still	1
in	1
the	1
hole	1
where	1
I	1
have	1
put	1
them.	1
I	1
daresay	1
more	1
carriages	1
will	1
come	1
by	1
before	1
it	1
is	1
quite	1
dark,	1
and	1
then	1
we	1
shall	1
have	1
more	1
halfpence."	1
Paul	1
had	1
taken	1
the	1
halfpence	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
hat,	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
put	1
them	1
into	1
a	1
hole	1
in	1
the	1
high	1
bank	1
by	1
the	1
roadside;	1
and	1
Anne	1
said	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
meddle	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
wait	1
till	1
her	1
brother	1
liked	1
to	1
count	1
them;	1
and	1
Paul	1
said--"If	1
you	1
will	1
stay	1
and	1
watch	1
here,	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
and	1
gather	1
some	1
blackberries	1
for	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
hedge	1
in	1
yonder	1
field.	1
Stand	1
you	1
hereabouts,	1
half-way	1
up	1
the	1
hill,	1
and	1
the	1
moment	1
you	1
see	1
any	1
carriage	1
coming	1
along	1
the	1
road,	1
run	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
you	1
can	1
and	1
call	1
me."	1
Anne	1
waited	1
a	1
long	1
time,	1
or	1
what	1
she	1
thought	1
a	1
long	1
time;	1
and	1
she	1
saw	1
no	1
carriage,	1
and	1
she	1
trailed	1
her	1
brother's	1
scotcher	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
till	1
she	1
was	1
tired.	1
Then	1
she	1
stood	1
still,	1
and	1
looked	1
again,	1
and	1
she	1
saw	1
no	1
carriage;	1
so	1
she	1
went	1
sorrowfully	1
into	1
the	1
field,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
hedge	1
where	1
her	1
brother	1
was	1
gathering	1
blackberries,	1
and	1
she	1
said,	1
"Paul,	1
I'm	1
sadly	1
tired,	1
SADLY	1
TIRED!"	1
said	1
she,	1
"and	1
my	1
eyes	1
are	1
quite	1
strained	1
with	1
looking	1
for	1
chaises;	1
no	1
more	1
chaises	1
will	1
come	1
to-night;	1
and	1
your	1
scotcher	1
is	1
lying	1
there,	1
of	1
no	1
use,	1
upon	1
the	1
ground.	1
Have	1
not	1
I	1
waited	1
long	1
enough	1
for	1
to-	1
day,	1
Paul?"	1
"Oh,	1
no,"	1
said	1
Paul;	1
"here	1
are	1
some	1
blackberries	1
for	1
you;	1
you	1
had	1
better	1
wait	1
a	1
little	1
bit	1
longer.	1
Perhaps	1
a	1
carriage	1
might	1
go	1
by	1
whilst	1
you	1
are	1
standing	1
here	1
talking	1
to	1
me."	1
Anne,	1
who	1
was	1
of	1
a	1
very	1
obliging	1
temper,	1
and	1
who	1
liked	1
to	1
do	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
asked	1
to	1
do,	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
the	1
scotcher	1
lay;	1
and	1
scarcely	1
had	1
she	1
reached	1
the	1
spot,	1
when	1
she	1
heard	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
a	1
carriage.	1
She	1
ran	1
to	1
call	1
her	1
brother,	1
and	1
to	1
their	1
great	1
joy,	1
they	1
now	1
saw	1
four	1
chaises	1
coming	1
towards	1
them.	1
Paul,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
went	1
up	1
the	1
hill,	1
followed	1
with	1
his	1
scotcher;	1
first	1
he	1
scotched	1
the	1
wheels	1
of	1
one	1
carriage,	1
then	1
of	1
another;	1
and	1
Anne	1
was	1
so	1
much	1
delighted	1
with	1
observing	1
how	1
well	1
the	1
scotcher	1
stopped	1
the	1
wheels,	1
and	1
how	1
much	1
better	1
it	1
was	1
than	1
stones,	1
that	1
she	1
forgot	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
hold	1
her	1
brother's	1
hat	1
to	1
the	1
travellers	1
for	1
halfpence,	1
till	1
she	1
was	1
roused	1
by	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
a	1
little	1
rosy	1
girl,	1
who	1
was	1
looking	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
chaises.	1
"Come	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
chaise-door,"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
girl;	1
"here	1
are	1
some	1
halfpence	1
for	1
you."	1
Anne	1
held	1
the	1
hat;	1
and	1
she	1
afterwards	1
went	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
carriages.	1
Money	1
was	1
thrown	1
to	1
her	1
from	1
each	1
of	1
them;	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
all	1
gotten	1
safely	1
to	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
hill,	1
she	1
and	1
her	1
brother	1
sat	1
down	1
upon	1
a	1
large	1
stone	1
by	1
the	1
roadside,	1
to	1
count	1
their	1
treasure.	1
First	1
they	1
began	1
by	1
counting	1
what	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
hat--"One,	1
two,	1
three,	1
four	1
halfpence."	1
"But,	1
oh,	1
brother,	1
look	1
at	1
this!"	1
exclaimed	1
Anne;	1
"this	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
the	1
other	1
halfpence."	1
"No,	1
indeed,	1
it	1
is	1
not,"	1
cried	1
Paul,	1
"it	1
is	1
no	1
halfpenny;	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
guinea,	1
a	1
bright	1
golden	1
guinea!"	1
"Is	1
it?"	1
said	1
Anne,	1
who	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
a	1
guinea	1
in	1
her	1
life	1
before,	1
and	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
its	1
value;	1
"and	1
will	1
it	1
do	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
a	1
halfpenny	1
to	1
buy	1
gingerbread?	1
I'll	1
run	1
to	1
the	1
fruit-stall,	1
and	1
ask	1
the	1
woman;	1
shall	1
I?"	1
"No,	1
no,"	1
said	1
Paul,	1
"you	1
need	1
not	1
ask	1
any	1
woman,	1
or	1
anybody	1
but	1
me;	1
I	1
can	1
tell	1
you	1
all	1
about	1
it,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
anybody	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
world."	1
"The	1
whole	1
world!	1
Oh,	1
Paul,	1
you	1
forgot.	1
Not	1
so	1
well	1
as	1
my	1
grandmother."	1
"Why,	1
not	1
so	1
well	1
as	1
my	1
grandmother,	1
perhaps,	1
but,	1
Anne,	1
I	1
can	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
you	1
must	1
not	1
talk	1
yourself,	1
Anne,	1
but	1
you	1
must	1
listen	1
to	1
me	1
quietly,	1
or	1
else	1
you	1
won't	1
understand	1
what	1
I	1
am	1
going	1
to	1
tell	1
you,	1
for	1
I	1
can	1
assure	1
you	1
that	1
I	1
don't	1
think	1
I	1
quite	1
understood	1
it	1
myself,	1
Anne,	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
my	1
grandmother	1
told	1
it	1
to	1
me,	1
though	1
I	1
stood	1
stock	1
still	1
listening	1
my	1
best."	1
Prepared	1
by	1
this	1
speech	1
to	1
hear	1
something	1
very	1
difficult	1
to	1
be	1
understood,	1
Anne	1
looked	1
very	1
grave,	1
and	1
her	1
brother	1
explained	1
to	1
her,	1
that,	1
with	1
a	1
guinea,	1
she	1
might	1
buy	1
two	1
hundred	1
and	1
fifty-two	1
times	1
as	1
many	1
plums	1
as	1
she	1
could	1
get	1
for	1
a	1
penny.	1
"Why,	1
Paul,	1
you	1
know	1
the	1
fruit-woman	1
said	1
she	1
would	1
give	1
us	1
a	1
dozen	1
plums	1
for	1
a	1
penny.	1
Now,	1
for	1
this	1
little	1
guinea,	1
would	1
she	1
give	1
us	1
two	1
hundred	1
and	1
fifty-two	1
dozen?"	1
"If	1
she	1
has	1
so	1
many,	1
and	1
if	1
we	1
like	1
to	1
have	1
so	1
many,	1
to	1
be	1
sure	1
she	1
will,"	1
said	1
Paul,	1
"but	1
I	1
think	1
we	1
should	1
not	1
like	1
to	1
have	1
two	1
hundred	1
and	1
fifty-two	1
dozen	1
of	1
plums;	1
we	1
could	1
not	1
eat	1
such	1
a	1
number."	1
"But	1
we	1
could	1
give	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
to	1
my	1
grandmother,"	1
said	1
Anne.	1
"But	1
still	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
too	1
many	1
for	1
her,	1
and	1
for	1
us,	1
too,"	1
said	1
Paul,	1
"and	1
when	1
we	1
had	1
eaten	1
the	1
plums,	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
pleasure.	1
But	1
now	1
I'll	1
tell	1
you	1
what	1
I	1
am	1
thinking	1
of,	1
Anne,	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
buy	1
something	1
for	1
my	1
grandmother,	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
very	1
useful	1
to	1
her	1
indeed,	1
with	1
the	1
guinea--something	1
that	1
would	1
last	1
a	1
great	1
while."	1
"What,	1
brother?	1
What	1
sort	1
of	1
thing?"	1
"Something	1
that	1
she	1
said	1
she	1
wanted	1
very	1
much	1
last	1
winter,	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
so	1
ill	1
with	1
the	1
rheumatism--something	1
that	1
she	1
said	1
yesterday,	1
when	1
you	1
were	1
making	1
her	1
bed,	1
she	1
wished	1
she	1
might	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
buy	1
before	1
next	1
winter."	1
"I	1
know,	1
I	1
know	1
what	1
you	1
mean!"	1
said	1
Anne--"a	1
blanket.	1
Oh,	1
yes,	1
Paul,	1
that	1
will	1
be	1
much	1
better	1
than	1
plums;	1
do	1
let	1
us	1
buy	1
a	1
blanket	1
for	1
her;	1
how	1
glad	1
she	1
will	1
be	1
to	1
see	1
it!	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
her	1
bed	1
with	1
the	1
new	1
blanket,	1
and	1
then	1
bring	1
her	1
to	1
see	1
it.	1
But,	1
Paul,	1
how	1
shall	1
we	1
buy	1
a	1
blanket?	1
Where	1
are	1
blankets	1
to	1
be	1
got?"	1
"Leave	1
that	1
to	1
me,	1
I'll	1
manage	1
that.	1
I	1
know	1
where	1
blankets	1
can	1
be	1
got.	1
I	1
saw	1
one	1
hanging	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
shop	1
the	1
day	1
I	1
went	1
last	1
to	1
Dunstable."	1
"You	1
have	1
seen	1
a	1
great	1
many	1
things	1
at	1
Dunstable,	1
brother."	1
"Yes,	1
a	1
great	1
many;	1
but	1
I	1
never	1
saw	1
anything	1
there	1
or	1
anywhere	1
else,	1
that	1
I	1
wished	1
for	1
half	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
I	1
did	1
for	1
the	1
blanket	1
for	1
my	1
grandmother.	1
Do	1
you	1
remember	1
how	1
she	1
used	1
to	1
shiver	1
with	1
the	1
cold	1
last	1
winter?	1
I'll	1
buy	1
the	1
blanket	1
to-morrow.	1
I'm	1
going	1
to	1
Dunstable	1
with	1
her	1
spinning."	1
"And	1
you'll	1
bring	1
the	1
blanket	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
make	1
the	1
bed	1
very	1
neatly,	1
that	1
will	1
be	1
all	1
right--all	1
happy!"	1
said	1
Anne,	1
clapping	1
her	1
hands.	1
"But	1
stay!	1
Hush!	1
don't	1
clap	1
your	1
hands	1
so,	1
Anne;	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
all	1
happy,	1
I'm	1
afraid,"	1
said	1
Paul,	1
and	1
his	1
countenance	1
changed,	1
and	1
he	1
looked	1
very	1
grave.	1
"It	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
all	1
right,	1
I'm	1
afraid,	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
one	1
thing	1
we	1
have	1
neither	1
of	1
us	1
thought	1
of,	1
but	1
that	1
we	1
ought	1
to	1
think	1
about.	1
We	1
cannot	1
buy	1
the	1
blanket,	1
I'm	1
afraid."	1
"Why,	1
Paul,	1
why?"	1
"Because	1
I	1
don't	1
think	1
this	1
guinea	1
is	1
honestly	1
ours."	1
"Nay,	1
brother,	1
but	1
I'm	1
sure	1
it	1
is	1
honestly	1
ours.	1
It	1
was	1
given	1
to	1
us,	1
and	1
grandmother	1
said	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
given	1
to	1
us	1
to-day	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
our	1
own."	1
"But	1
who	1
gave	1
it	1
to	1
you,	1
Anne?"	1
"Some	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
those	1
chaises,	1
Paul.	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
which	1
of	1
them,	1
but	1
I	1
daresay	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
little	1
rosy	1
girl."	1
"No,"	1
said	1
Paul,	1
"for	1
when	1
she	1
called	1
you	1
to	1
the	1
chaise	1
door,	1
she	1
said,	1
'Here's	1
some	1
halfpence	1
for	1
you.'	1
Now,	1
if	1
she	1
gave	1
you	1
the	1
guinea,	1
she	1
must	1
have	1
given	1
it	1
to	1
you	1
by	1
mistake."	1
"Well,	1
but	1
perhaps	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
other	1
chaises	1
gave	1
it	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
give	1
it	1
to	1
me	1
by	1
mistake,	1
Paul.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
gentleman	1
reading	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
chaises	1
and	1
a	1
lady,	1
who	1
looked	1
very	1
good-naturedly	1
at	1
me,	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
gentleman	1
put	1
down	1
his	1
book	1
and	1
put	1
his	1
head	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window,	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
your	1
scotcher,	1
brother,	1
and	1
he	1
asked	1
me	1
if	1
that	1
was	1
your	1
own	1
making;	1
and	1
when	1
I	1
said	1
yes,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
your	1
sister	1
he	1
smiled	1
at	1
me,	1
and	1
put	1
his	1
hand	1
into	1
his	1
waistcoat	1
pocket,	1
and	1
threw	1
a	1
handful	1
of	1
halfpence	1
into	1
the	1
hat,	1
and	1
I	1
daresay	1
he	1
gave	1
us	1
the	1
guinea	1
along	1
with	1
them	1
because	1
he	1
liked	1
your	1
scotcher	1
so	1
much."	1
"Why,"	1
said	1
Paul,	1
"that	1
might	1
be,	1
to	1
be	1
sure,	1
but	1
I	1
wish	1
I	1
was	1
quite	1
certain	1
of	1
it."	1
"Then,	1
as	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
quite	1
certain,	1
had	1
not	1
we	1
best	1
go	1
and	1
ask	1
my	1
grandmother	1
what	1
she	1
thinks	1
about	1
it?"	1
Paul	1
thought	1
this	1
was	1
excellent	1
advice;	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
silly	1
boy,	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
to	1
follow	1
good	1
advice.	1
He	1
went	1
with	1
his	1
sister	1
directly	1
to	1
his	1
grandmother,	1
showed	1
her	1
the	1
guinea,	1
and	1
told	1
her	1
how	1
they	1
came	1
by	1
it.	1
"My	1
dear,	1
honest	1
children,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"I	1
am	1
very	1
glad	1
you	1
told	1
me	1
all	1
this.	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
glad	1
that	1
you	1
did	1
not	1
buy	1
either	1
the	1
plums	1
or	1
the	1
blanket	1
with	1
this	1
guinea.	1
I'm	1
sure	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
honestly	1
ours.	1
Those	1
who	1
threw	1
it	1
you	1
gave	1
it	1
you	1
by	1
mistake,	1
I	1
warrant;	1
and	1
what	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
you	1
do	1
is,	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
Dunstable,	1
and	1
try	1
if	1
you	1
can,	1
at	1
either	1
of	1
the	1
inns	1
find	1
out	1
the	1
person	1
who	1
gave	1
it	1
to	1
you.	1
It	1
is	1
now	1
so	1
late	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
that	1
perhaps	1
the	1
travellers	1
will	1
sleep	1
at	1
Dunstable,	1
instead	1
of	1
going	1
on	1
the	1
next	1
stage;	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
likely	1
that	1
whosoever	1
gave	1
you	1
a	1
guinea	1
instead	1
of	1
a	1
halfpenny	1
has	1
found	1
out	1
their	1
mistake	1
by	1
this	1
time.	1
All	1
you	1
can	1
do	1
is	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
inquire	1
for	1
the	1
gentleman	1
who	1
was	1
reading	1
in	1
the	1
chaise."	1
"Oh!"	1
interrupted	1
Paul,	1
"I	1
know	1
a	1
good	1
way	1
of	1
finding	1
him	1
out.	1
I	1
remember	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
dark	1
green	1
chaise	1
with	1
red	1
wheels:	1
and	1
I	1
remember	1
I	1
read	1
the	1
innkeeper's	1
name	1
upon	1
the	1
chaise,	1
'John	1
Nelson.'	1
(I	1
am	1
much	1
obliged	1
to	1
you	1
for	1
teaching	1
me	1
to	1
read,	1
grandmother.)	1
You	1
told	1
me	1
yesterday,	1
grandmother,	1
that	1
the	1
names	1
written	1
upon	1
chaises	1
are	1
the	1
innkeepers	1
to	1
whom	1
they	1
belong.	1
I	1
read	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
innkeeper	1
upon	1
that	1
chaise.	1
It	1
was	1
John	1
Nelson.	1
So	1
Anne	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
to	1
both	1
the	1
inns	1
in	1
Dunstable,	1
and	1
try	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
this	1
chaise--John	1
Nelson's.	1
Come,	1
Anne;	1
let	1
us	1
set	1
out	1
before	1
it	1
gets	1
quite	1
dark."	1
Anne	1
and	1
her	1
brother	1
passed	1
with	1
great	1
courage	1
the	1
tempting	1
stall	1
that	1
was	1
covered	1
with	1
gingerbread	1
and	1
ripe	1
plums,	1
and	1
pursued	1
their	1
way	1
steadily	1
through	1
the	1
streets	1
of	1
Dunstable;	1
but	1
Paul,	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
shop	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
the	1
blanket,	1
stopped	1
for	1
a	1
moment,	1
and	1
said,	1
"It	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
pity,	1
Anne,	1
that	1
the	1
guinea	1
is	1
not	1
ours.	1
However,	1
we	1
are	1
doing	1
what	1
is	1
honest,	1
and	1
that	1
is	1
a	1
comfort.	1
Here,	1
we	1
must	1
go	1
through	1
this	1
gateway,	1
into	1
the	1
inn-yard;	1
we	1
are	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
'Dun	1
Cow.'"	1
"Cow!"	1
said	1
Anne,	1
"I	1
see	1
no	1
cow."	1
"Look	1
up,	1
and	1
you'll	1
see	1
the	1
cow	1
over	1
your	1
head,"	1
said	1
Paul--"the	1
sign--	1
the	1
picture.	1
Come,	1
never	1
mind	1
looking	1
at	1
it	1
now;	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
the	1
green	1
chaise	1
that	1
has	1
John	1
Nelson's	1
name	1
upon	1
it."	1
Paul	1
pushed	1
forward,	1
through	1
a	1
crowded	1
passage,	1
till	1
he	1
got	1
into	1
the	1
inn-	1
yard.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
noise	1
and	1
bustle.	1
The	1
hostlers	1
were	1
carrying	1
in	1
luggage.	1
The	1
postillions	1
were	1
rubbing	1
down	1
the	1
horses,	1
or	1
rolling	1
the	1
chaises	1
into	1
the	1
coach-house.	1
"What	1
now!	1
What	1
business	1
have	1
you	1
here,	1
pray?"	1
said	1
a	1
waiter,	1
who	1
almost	1
ran	1
over	1
Paul,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
crossing	1
the	1
yard	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
hurry	1
to	1
get	1
some	1
empty	1
bottles	1
from	1
the	1
bottle-rack.	1
"You've	1
no	1
business	1
here,	1
crowding	1
up	1
the	1
yard.	1
Walk	1
off,	1
young	1
gentleman,	1
if	1
you	1
please."	1
"Pray	1
give	1
me	1
leave,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
Paul,	1
"to	1
stay	1
a	1
few	1
minutes,	1
to	1
look	1
amongst	1
these	1
chaises	1
for	1
one	1
dark	1
green	1
chaise	1
with	1
red	1
wheels,	1
that	1
has	1
Mr.	1
John	1
Nelson's	1
name	1
written	1
upon	1
it."	1
"What's	1
that	1
he	1
says	1
about	1
a	1
dark	1
green	1
chaise?"	1
said	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
postillions.	1
"What	1
should	1
such	1
a	1
one	1
as	1
he	1
is	1
know	1
about	1
chaises?"	1
interrupted	1
the	1
hasty	1
waiter,	1
and	1
he	1
vas	1
going	1
to	1
turn	1
Paul	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
yard;	1
but	1
the	1
hostler	1
caught	1
hold	1
of	1
his	1
arm	1
and	1
said,	1
"Maybe	1
the	1
child	1
has	1
some	1
business	1
here;	1
let's	1
know	1
what	1
he	1
has	1
to	1
say	1
for	1
himself."	1
The	1
waiter	1
was	1
at	1
this	1
instant	1
luckily	1
obliged	1
to	1
leave	1
them	1
to	1
attend	1
the	1
bell;	1
and	1
Paul	1
told	1
his	1
business	1
to	1
the	1
hostler,	1
who	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
guinea	1
and	1
heard	1
the	1
story,	1
shook	1
Paul	1
by	1
the	1
hand,	1
and	1
said,	1
"Stand	1
steady,	1
my	1
honest	1
lad;	1
I'll	1
find	1
the	1
chaise	1
for	1
you,	1
if	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
here;	1
but	1
John	1
Nelson's	1
chaises	1
almost	1
always	1
drive	1
to	1
the	1
'Black	1
Bull.'"	1
After	1
some	1
difficulty,	1
the	1
green	1
chaise,	1
with	1
John	1
Nelson's	1
name	1
upon	1
it,	1
and	1
the	1
postillion	1
who	1
drove	1
that	1
chaise,	1
were	1
found;	1
and	1
the	1
postillion	1
told	1
Paul	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
just	1
going	1
into	1
the	1
parlour	1
to	1
the	1
gentleman	1
he	1
had	1
driven,	1
to	1
be	1
paid,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
carry	1
the	1
guinea	1
with	1
him.	1
"No,"	1
said	1
Paul,	1
"we	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
give	1
it	1
back	1
ourselves."	1
"Yes,"	1
said	1
the	1
hostler;	1
"that	1
they	1
have	1
a	1
right	1
to	1
do."	1
The	1
postillion	1
made	1
no	1
reply,	1
but	1
looked	1
vexed,	1
and	1
went	1
towards	1
the	1
house,	1
desiring	1
the	1
children	1
would	1
wait	1
in	1
the	1
passage	1
till	1
his	1
return.	1
In	1
the	1
passage	1
there	1
was	1
standing	1
a	1
decent,	1
clean,	1
good	1
natured	1
looking	1
woman,	1
with	1
two	1
huge	1
straw	1
baskets	1
on	1
each	1
side	1
of	1
her.	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
baskets	1
stood	1
a	1
little	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
entrance.	1
A	1
man	1
who	1
was	1
pushing	1
his	1
way	1
in,	1
and	1
carried	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
a	1
string	1
of	1
dead	1
larks	1
hung	1
to	1
a	1
pole,	1
impatient	1
at	1
being	1
stopped,	1
kicked	1
down	1
the	1
straw	1
basket,	1
and	1
all	1
its	1
contents	1
were	1
thrown	1
out.	1
Bright	1
straw	1
hats,	1
and	1
boxes,	1
and	1
slippers,	1
were	1
all	1
thrown	1
in	1
disorder	1
upon	1
the	1
dirty	1
ground.	1
"Oh,	1
they	1
will	1
be	1
trampled	1
upon!	1
They	1
will	1
be	1
all	1
spoiled!"	1
exclaimed	1
the	1
woman	1
to	1
whom	1
they	1
belonged.	1
"We'll	1
help	1
you	1
to	1
pick	1
them	1
up	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
let	1
us,"	1
cried	1
Paul	1
and	1
Anne;	1
and	1
they	1
immediately	1
ran	1
to	1
her	1
assistance.	1
When	1
the	1
things	1
were	1
all	1
safe	1
in	1
the	1
basket	1
again,	1
the	1
children	1
expressed	1
a	1
desire	1
to	1
know	1
how	1
such	1
beautiful	1
things	1
could	1
be	1
made	1
of	1
straw;	1
but	1
the	1
woman	1
had	1
not	1
time	1
to	1
answer	1
before	1
the	1
postillion	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
parlour,	1
and	1
with	1
him	1
a	1
gentleman's	1
servant,	1
who	1
came	1
to	1
Paul,	1
and	1
clapping	1
him	1
upon	1
the	1
back,	1
said,	1
"So,	1
my	1
little	1
chap,	1
I	1
gave	1
you	1
a	1
guinea	1
for	1
a	1
halfpenny,	1
I	1
hear;	1
and	1
I	1
understand	1
you've	1
brought	1
it	1
back	1
again;	1
that's	1
right,	1
give	1
me	1
hold	1
of	1
it."	1
"No,	1
brother,"	1
said	1
Anne,	1
"this	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
gentleman	1
that	1
was	1
reading."	1
"Pooh,	1
child,	1
I	1
came	1
in	1
Mr.	1
Nelson's	1
green	1
chaise.	1
Here's	1
the	1
postillion	1
can	1
tell	1
you	1
so.	1
I	1
and	1
my	1
master	1
came	1
in	1
that	1
chaise.	1
I	1
and	1
my	1
master	1
that	1
was	1
reading,	1
as	1
you	1
say,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
he	1
that	1
threw	1
the	1
money	1
out	1
to	1
you.	1
He	1
is	1
going	1
to	1
bed;	1
he	1
is	1
tired	1
and	1
can't	1
see	1
you	1
himself.	1
He	1
desires	1
that	1
you'll	1
give	1
me	1
the	1
guinea."	1
He	1
pushed	1
them	1
towards	1
the	1
door;	1
but	1
the	1
basket-woman	1
whispered	1
to	1
them	1
as	1
they	1
went	1
out,	1
"Wait	1
in	1
the	1
street	1
till	1
I	1
come	1
to	1
you."	1
"Pray,	1
Mrs.	1
Landlady,"	1
cried	1
this	1
gentleman's	1
servant,	1
addressing	1
himself	1
to	1
the	1
landlady,	1
who	1
just	1
then	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
room	1
where	1
some	1
company	1
were	1
at	1
supper,	1
"Pray,	1
Mrs.	1
Landlady,	1
please	1
to	1
let	1
me	1
have	1
roasted	1
larks	1
for	1
my	1
supper.	1
You	1
are	1
famous	1
for	1
larks	1
at	1
Dunstable;	1
and	1
I	1
make	1
it	1
a	1
rule	1
to	1
taste	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
everything	1
wherever	1
I	1
go;	1
and,	1
waiter,	1
let	1
me	1
have	1
a	1
bottle	1
of	1
claret.	1
Do	1
you	1
hear?"	1
"Larks	1
and	1
claret	1
for	1
his	1
supper,"	1
said	1
the	1
basket-woman	1
to	1
herself,	1
as	1
she	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
from	1
head	1
to	1
foot.	1
The	1
postillion	1
was	1
still	1
waiting,	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
him;	1
and	1
she	1
observed	1
them	1
afterwards	1
whispering	1
and	1
laughing	1
together.	1
"NO	1
BAD	1
HIT,"	1
was	1
a	1
sentence	1
which	1
the	1
servant	1
pronounced	1
several	1
times.	1
Now	1
it	1
occurred	1
to	1
the	1
basket-woman	1
that	1
this	1
man	1
had	1
cheated	1
the	1
children	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
guinea	1
to	1
pay	1
for	1
the	1
larks	1
and	1
claret;	1
and	1
she	1
thought	1
that	1
perhaps	1
she	1
could	1
discover	1
the	1
truth.	1
She	1
waited	1
quietly	1
in	1
the	1
passage.	1
"Waiter!	1
Joe!	1
Joe!"	1
cried	1
the	1
landlady,	1
"why	1
don't	1
you	1
carry	1
in	1
the	1
sweetmeat-puffs	1
and	1
the	1
tarts	1
here	1
to	1
the	1
company	1
in	1
the	1
best	1
parlour?"	1
"Coming,	1
ma'am,"	1
answered	1
the	1
waiter;	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
large	1
dish	1
of	1
tarts	1
and	1
puffs,	1
the	1
waiter	1
came	1
from	1
the	1
bar;	1
the	1
landlady	1
threw	1
open	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
parlour,	1
to	1
let	1
him	1
in;	1
and	1
the	1
basket-woman	1
had	1
now	1
a	1
full	1
view	1
of	1
a	1
large	1
cheerful	1
company,	1
and	1
amongst	1
them	1
several	1
children,	1
sitting	1
round	1
a	1
supper-table.	1
"Ay,"	1
whispered	1
the	1
landlady,	1
as	1
the	1
door	1
closed	1
after	1
the	1
waiter	1
and	1
the	1
tarts,	1
"there	1
are	1
customers	1
enough,	1
I	1
warrant,	1
for	1
you	1
in	1
that	1
room,	1
if	1
you	1
had	1
but	1
the	1
luck	1
to	1
be	1
called	1
in.	1
Pray,	1
what	1
would	1
you	1
have	1
the	1
conscience,	1
I	1
wonder	1
now,	1
to	1
charge	1
me	1
for	1
these	1
here	1
half-dozen	1
little	1
mats	1
to	1
put	1
under	1
my	1
dishes?"	1
"A	1
trifle,	1
ma'am,"	1
said	1
the	1
basket-woman.	1
She	1
let	1
the	1
landlady	1
have	1
the	1
mats	1
cheap,	1
and	1
the	1
landlady	1
then	1
declared	1
she	1
would	1
step	1
in	1
and	1
see	1
if	1
the	1
company	1
in	1
the	1
best	1
parlour	1
had	1
done	1
supper.	1
"When	1
they	1
come	1
to	1
their	1
wine,"	1
added	1
she,	1
"I'll	1
speak	1
a	1
good	1
word	1
for	1
you,	1
and	1
get	1
you	1
called	1
in	1
afore	1
the	1
children	1
are	1
sent	1
to	1
bed."	1
The	1
landlady,	1
after	1
the	1
usual	1
speech	1
of,	1
"I	1
hope	1
the	1
supper	1
and	1
everything	1
is	1
to	1
your	1
liking,	1
ladies	1
and	1
gentlemen,"	1
began	1
with,	1
"If	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
gentlemen	1
or	1
ladies	1
would	1
have	1
a	1
CUR'OSITY	1
to	1
see	1
any	1
of	1
our	1
famous	1
Dunstable	1
straw-work,	1
there's	1
a	1
decent	1
body	1
without	1
would,	1
I	1
daresay,	1
be	1
proud	1
to	1
show	1
them	1
her	1
pincushion-boxes,	1
and	1
her	1
baskets	1
and	1
slippers,	1
and	1
her	1
other	1
CUR'OSITIES."	1
The	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
all	1
turned	1
towards	1
their	1
mother;	1
their	1
mother	1
smiled,	1
and	1
immediately	1
their	1
father	1
called	1
in	1
the	1
basket-woman,	1
and	1
desired	1
her	1
to	1
produce	1
her	1
CURIOSITIES.	1
The	1
children	1
gathered	1
round	1
her	1
large	1
pannier	1
as	1
it	1
opened,	1
but	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
touch	1
any	1
of	1
her	1
things.	1
"Ah,	1
papa!"	1
cried	1
a	1
little	1
rosy	1
girl,	1
"here	1
are	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
straw	1
slippers	1
that	1
would	1
just	1
fit	1
you,	1
I	1
think;	1
but	1
would	1
not	1
straw	1
shoes	1
wear	1
out	1
very	1
soon?	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
they	1
let	1
in	1
the	1
wet?"	1
"Yes,	1
my	1
dear,"	1
said	1
her	1
father,	1
"but	1
these	1
slippers	1
are	1
meant--"	1
"For	1
powdering-slippers,	1
miss,"	1
interrupted	1
the	1
basket-woman.	1
"To	1
wear	1
when	1
people	1
are	1
powdering	1
their	1
hair,"	1
continued	1
the	1
gentleman,	1
"that	1
they	1
may	1
not	1
spoil	1
their	1
other	1
shoes."	1
"And	1
will	1
you	1
buy	1
them,	1
papa?"	1
"No,	1
I	1
cannot	1
indulge	1
myself,"	1
said	1
her	1
father,	1
"in	1
buying	1
them	1
now.	1
I	1
must	1
make	1
amends,"	1
said	1
he,	1
laughing,	1
"for	1
my	1
carelessness;	1
and	1
as	1
I	1
threw	1
away	1
a	1
guinea	1
to-day,	1
I	1
must	1
endeavour	1
to	1
save	1
sixpence	1
at	1
least?"	1
"Ah,	1
the	1
guinea	1
that	1
you	1
threw	1
by	1
mistake	1
into	1
the	1
little	1
girl's	1
hat	1
as	1
we	1
were	1
coming	1
up	1
Chalk	1
Hill.	1
Mamma,	1
I	1
wonder	1
that	1
the	1
little	1
girl	1
did	1
not	1
take	1
notice	1
of	1
its	1
being	1
a	1
guinea,	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
run	1
after	1
the	1
chaise	1
to	1
give	1
it	1
back	1
again.	1
I	1
should	1
think,	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
an	1
honest	1
girl,	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
returned	1
it."	1
"Miss!--ma'am!--sir!"	1
said	1
the	1
basket-woman,	1
"if	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
impertinent,	1
may	1
I	1
speak	1
a	1
word?	1
A	1
little	1
boy	1
and	1
girl	1
have	1
just	1
been	1
here	1
inquiring	1
for	1
a	1
gentleman	1
who	1
gave	1
them	1
a	1
guinea	1
instead	1
of	1
a	1
halfpenny	1
by	1
mistake;	1
and	1
not	1
five	1
minutes	1
ago	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
boy	1
give	1
the	1
guinea	1
to	1
a	1
gentleman's	1
servant,	1
who	1
is	1
there	1
without,	1
and	1
who	1
said	1
his	1
master	1
desired	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
returned	1
to	1
him."	1
"There	1
must	1
be	1
some	1
mistake,	1
or	1
some	1
trick	1
in	1
this,"	1
said	1
the	1
gentleman.	1
"Are	1
the	1
children	1
gone?	1
I	1
must	1
see	1
them--send	1
after	1
them."	1
"I'll	1
go	1
for	1
them	1
myself,"	1
said	1
the	1
good	1
natured	1
basket-woman;	1
"I	1
bid	1
them	1
wait	1
in	1
the	1
street	1
yonder,	1
for	1
my	1
mind	1
misgave	1
me	1
that	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
spoke	1
so	1
short	1
to	1
them	1
was	1
a	1
cheat,	1
with	1
his	1
larks	1
and	1
his	1
claret."	1
Paul	1
and	1
Anne	1
were	1
speedily	1
summoned,	1
and	1
brought	1
back	1
by	1
their	1
friend	1
the	1
basket-woman;	1
and	1
Anne,	1
the	1
moment	1
she	1
saw	1
the	1
gentleman,	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
very	1
person	1
who	1
smiled	1
upon	1
her,	1
who	1
admired	1
her	1
brother's	1
scotcher,	1
and	1
who	1
threw	1
a	1
handful	1
of	1
halfpence	1
into	1
the	1
hat;	1
but	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
certain,	1
she	1
said,	1
that	1
she	1
received	1
the	1
guinea	1
from	1
him;	1
she	1
only	1
thought	1
it	1
most	1
likely	1
that	1
she	1
did.	1
"But	1
I	1
can	1
be	1
certain	1
whether	1
the	1
guinea	1
you	1
returned	1
be	1
mine	1
or	1
no,"	1
said	1
the	1
gentleman.	1
"I	1
marked	1
the	1
guinea;	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
light	1
one;	1
the	1
only	1
guinea	1
I	1
had,	1
which	1
I	1
put	1
into	1
my	1
waistcoat	1
pocket	1
this	1
morning."	1
He	1
rang	1
the	1
bell,	1
and	1
desired	1
the	1
waiter	1
to	1
let	1
the	1
gentleman	1
who	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
opposite	1
to	1
him	1
know	1
that	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
see	1
him.	1
"The	1
gentleman	1
in	1
the	1
white	1
parlour,	1
sir,	1
do	1
you	1
mean?"	1
"I	1
mean	1
the	1
master	1
of	1
the	1
servant	1
who	1
received	1
a	1
guinea	1
from	1
this	1
child."	1
"He	1
is	1
a	1
Mr.	1
Pembroke,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
the	1
waiter.	1
Mr.	1
Pembroke	1
came;	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
heard	1
what	1
had	1
happened,	1
he	1
desired	1
the	1
waiter	1
to	1
show	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
room	1
where	1
his	1
servant	1
was	1
at	1
supper.	1
The	1
dishonest	1
servant,	1
who	1
was	1
supping	1
upon	1
larks	1
and	1
claret,	1
knew	1
nothing	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
going	1
on;	1
but	1
his	1
knife	1
and	1
fork	1
dropped	1
from	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
he	1
overturned	1
a	1
bumper	1
of	1
claret	1
as	1
he	1
started	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
table,	1
in	1
great	1
surprise	1
and	1
terror,	1
when	1
his	1
master	1
came	1
in	1
with	1
a	1
face	1
of	1
indignation,	1
and	1
demanded	1
"THE	1
GUINEA--the	1
GUINEA,	1
sir!	1
that	1
you	1
got	1
from	1
this	1
child;	1
that	1
guinea	1
which	1
you	1
said	1
I	1
ordered	1
you	1
to	1
ask	1
for	1
from	1
this	1
child."	1
The	1
servant,	1
confounded	1
and	1
half	1
intoxicated,	1
could	1
only	1
stammer	1
out	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
more	1
guineas	1
than	1
one	1
about	1
him,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
really	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
which	1
it	1
was.	1
He	1
pulled	1
his	1
money	1
out,	1
and	1
spread	1
it	1
upon	1
the	1
table	1
with	1
trembling	1
hands.	1
The	1
marked	1
guinea	1
appeared.	1
His	1
master	1
instantly	1
turned	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
service	1
with	1
strong	1
expressions	1
of	1
contempt.	1
"And	1
now,	1
my	1
little	1
honest	1
girl,"	1
said	1
the	1
gentleman	1
who	1
had	1
admired	1
her	1
brother's	1
scotcher,	1
turning	1
to	1
Anne,	1
"and	1
now	1
tell	1
me	1
who	1
you	1
are,	1
and	1
what	1
you	1
and	1
your	1
brother	1
want	1
or	1
wish	1
for	1
most	1
in	1
the	1
world."	1
In	1
the	1
same	1
moment	1
Anne	1
and	1
Paul	1
exclaimed,	1
"The	1
thing	1
we	1
wish	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
is	1
a	1
blanket	1
for	1
our	1
grandmother."	1
"She	1
is	1
not	1
our	1
grandmother	1
in	1
reality,	1
I	1
believe,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
Paul;	1
"but	1
she	1
is	1
just	1
as	1
good	1
to	1
us,	1
and	1
taught	1
me	1
to	1
read,	1
and	1
taught	1
Anne	1
to	1
knit,	1
and	1
taught	1
us	1
both	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
be	1
honest--so	1
she	1
has;	1
and	1
I	1
wish	1
she	1
had	1
a	1
new	1
blanket	1
before	1
next	1
winter,	1
to	1
keep	1
her	1
from	1
the	1
cold	1
and	1
the	1
rheumatism.	1
She	1
had	1
the	1
rheumatism	1
sadly	1
last	1
winter,	1
sir;	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
blanket	1
in	1
this	1
street	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
just	1
the	1
thing	1
for	1
her."	1
"She	1
shall	1
have	1
it,	1
then;	1
and,"	1
continued	1
the	1
gentleman,	1
"I	1
will	1
do	1
something	1
more	1
for	1
you.	1
Do	1
you	1
like	1
to	1
be	1
employed	1
or	1
to	1
be	1
idle	1
best?"	1
"We	1
like	1
to	1
have	1
something	1
to	1
do	1
always,	1
if	1
we	1
could,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
Paul;	1
"but	1
we	1
are	1
forced	1
to	1
be	1
idle	1
sometimes,	1
because	1
grandmother	1
has	1
not	1
always	1
things	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
do	1
that	1
we	1
CAN	1
do	1
well."	1
"Should	1
you	1
like	1
to	1
learn	1
how	1
to	1
make	1
such	1
baskets	1
as	1
these?"	1
said	1
the	1
gentleman,	1
pointing	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
Dunstable	1
straw-baskets.	1
"Oh,	1
very	1
much!"	1
said	1
Paul.	1
"Very	1
much!"	1
said	1
Anne.	1
"Then	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
teach	1
you	1
how	1
to	1
make	1
them,"	1
said	1
the	1
basket-	1
woman;	1
"for	1
I'm	1
sure	1
of	1
one	1
thing,	1
that	1
you'd	1
behave	1
honestly	1
to	1
me."	1
The	1
gentleman	1
put	1
a	1
guinea	1
into	1
the	1
good	1
natured	1
basket-woman's	1
hand,	1
and	1
told	1
her	1
that	1
he	1
knew	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
afford	1
to	1
teach	1
them	1
her	1
trade	1
for	1
nothing.	1
"I	1
shall	1
come	1
through	1
Dunstable	1
again	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
months,"	1
added	1
he;	1
"and	1
I	1
hope	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
you	1
and	1
your	1
scholars	1
are	1
going	1
on	1
well.	1
If	1
I	1
find	1
that	1
they	1
are,	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
something	1
more	1
for	1
you."	1
"But,"	1
said	1
Anne,	1
"we	1
must	1
tell	1
all	1
this	1
to	1
grandmother,	1
and	1
ask	1
her	1
about	1
it;	1
and	1
I'm	1
afraid--though	1
I'm	1
very	1
happy--that	1
it	1
is	1
getting	1
very	1
late,	1
and	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
not	1
stay	1
here	1
any	1
longer."	1
"It	1
is	1
a	1
fine	1
moonlight	1
night,"	1
said	1
the	1
basket-woman;	1
"and	1
is	1
not	1
far.	1
I'll	1
walk	1
with	1
you,	1
and	1
see	1
you	1
safe	1
home	1
myself."	1
The	1
gentleman	1
detained	1
them	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
longer,	1
till	1
a	1
messenger	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
dispatched	1
to	1
purchase	1
the	1
much	1
wished	1
for	1
blanket	1
returned.	1
"Your	1
grandmother	1
will	1
sleep	1
well	1
upon	1
this	1
good	1
blanket,	1
I	1
hope,"	1
said	1
the	1
gentleman,	1
as	1
he	1
gave	1
it	1
into	1
Paul's	1
opened	1
arms.	1
"It	1
has	1
been	1
obtained	1
for	1
her	1
by	1
the	1
honesty	1
of	1
her	1
adopted	1
children."	1
