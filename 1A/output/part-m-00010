[The	1
Man	1

Was	1
Thursday	1
by	1
G.	1
K.	1
Chesterton	1
1908]	1
To	1
Edmund	1
Clerihew	1
Bentley	1
A	1
cloud	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
mind	1
of	1
men,	1
and	1
wailing	1
went	1
the	1
weather,	1
Yea,	1
a	1
sick	1
cloud	1
upon	1
the	1
soul	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
boys	1
together.	1
Science	1
announced	1
nonentity	1
and	1
art	1
admired	1
decay;	1
The	1
world	1
was	1
old	1
and	1
ended:	1
but	1
you	1
and	1
I	1
were	1
gay;	1
Round	1
us	1
in	1
antic	1
order	1
their	1
crippled	1
vices	1
came--	1
Lust	1
that	1
had	1
lost	1
its	1
laughter,	1
fear	1
that	1
had	1
lost	1
its	1
shame.	1
Like	1
the	1
white	1
lock	1
of	1
Whistler,	1
that	1
lit	1
our	1
aimless	1
gloom,	1
Men	1
showed	1
their	1
own	1
white	1
feather	1
as	1
proudly	1
as	1
a	1
plume.	1
Life	1
was	1
a	1
fly	1
that	1
faded,	1
and	1
death	1
a	1
drone	1
that	1
stung;	1
The	1
world	1
was	1
very	1
old	1
indeed	1
when	1
you	1
and	1
I	1
were	1
young.	1
They	1
twisted	1
even	1
decent	1
sin	1
to	1
shapes	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
named:	1
Men	1
were	1
ashamed	1
of	1
honour;	1
but	1
we	1
were	1
not	1
ashamed.	1
Weak	1
if	1
we	1
were	1
and	1
foolish,	1
not	1
thus	1
we	1
failed,	1
not	1
thus;	1
When	1
that	1
black	1
Baal	1
blocked	1
the	1
heavens	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
hymns	1
from	1
us	1
Children	1
we	1
were--our	1
forts	1
of	1
sand	1
were	1
even	1
as	1
weak	1
as	1
eve,	1
High	1
as	1
they	1
went	1
we	1
piled	1
them	1
up	1
to	1
break	1
that	1
bitter	1
sea.	1
Fools	1
as	1
we	1
were	1
in	1
motley,	1
all	1
jangling	1
and	1
absurd,	1
When	1
all	1
church	1
bells	1
were	1
silent	1
our	1
cap	1
and	1
beds	1
were	1
heard.	1
Not	1
all	1
unhelped	1
we	1
held	1
the	1
fort,	1
our	1
tiny	1
flags	1
unfurled;	1
Some	1
giants	1
laboured	1
in	1
that	1
cloud	1
to	1
lift	1
it	1
from	1
the	1
world.	1
I	1
find	1
again	1
the	1
book	1
we	1
found,	1
I	1
feel	1
the	1
hour	1
that	1
flings	1
Far	1
out	1
of	1
fish-shaped	1
Paumanok	1
some	1
cry	1
of	1
cleaner	1
things;	1
And	1
the	1
Green	1
Carnation	1
withered,	1
as	1
in	1
forest	1
fires	1
that	1
pass,	1
Roared	1
in	1
the	1
wind	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
ten	1
million	1
leaves	1
of	1
grass;	1
Or	1
sane	1
and	1
sweet	1
and	1
sudden	1
as	1
a	1
bird	1
sings	1
in	1
the	1
rain--	1
Truth	1
out	1
of	1
Tusitala	1
spoke	1
and	1
pleasure	1
out	1
of	1
pain.	1
Yea,	1
cool	1
and	1
clear	1
and	1
sudden	1
as	1
a	1
bird	1
sings	1
in	1
the	1
grey,	1
Dunedin	1
to	1
Samoa	1
spoke,	1
and	1
darkness	1
unto	1
day.	1
But	1
we	1
were	1
young;	1
we	1
lived	1
to	1
see	1
God	1
break	1
their	1
bitter	1
charms.	1
God	1
and	1
the	1
good	1
Republic	1
come	1
riding	1
back	1
in	1
arms:	1
We	1
have	1
seen	1
the	1
City	1
of	1
Mansoul,	1
even	1
as	1
it	1
rocked,	1
relieved--	1
Blessed	1
are	1
they	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
see,	1
but	1
being	1
blind,	1
believed.	1
This	1
is	1
a	1
tale	1
of	1
those	1
old	1
fears,	1
even	1
of	1
those	1
emptied	1
hells,	1
And	1
none	1
but	1
you	1
shall	1
understand	1
the	1
true	1
thing	1
that	1
it	1
tells--	1
Of	1
what	1
colossal	1
gods	1
of	1
shame	1
could	1
cow	1
men	1
and	1
yet	1
crash,	1
Of	1
what	1
huge	1
devils	1
hid	1
the	1
stars,	1
yet	1
fell	1
at	1
a	1
pistol	1
flash.	1
The	1
doubts	1
that	1
were	1
so	1
plain	1
to	1
chase,	1
so	1
dreadful	1
to	1
withstand--	1
Oh,	1
who	1
shall	1
understand	1
but	1
you;	1
yea,	1
who	1
shall	1
understand?	1
The	1
doubts	1
that	1
drove	1
us	1
through	1
the	1
night	1
as	1
we	1
two	1
talked	1
amain,	1
And	1
day	1
had	1
broken	1
on	1
the	1
streets	1
e'er	1
it	1
broke	1
upon	1
the	1
brain.	1
Between	1
us,	1
by	1
the	1
peace	1
of	1
God,	1
such	1
truth	1
can	1
now	1
be	1
told;	1
Yea,	1
there	1
is	1
strength	1
in	1
striking	1
root	1
and	1
good	1
in	1
growing	1
old.	1
We	1
have	1
found	1
common	1
things	1
at	1
last	1
and	1
marriage	1
and	1
a	1
creed,	1
And	1
I	1
may	1
safely	1
write	1
it	1
now,	1
and	1
you	1
may	1
safely	1
read.	1

CHAPTER	1
I	1
THE	1
TWO	1
POETS	1
OF	1
SAFFRON	1
PARK	1
THE	1
suburb	1
of	1
Saffron	1
Park	1
lay	1
on	1
the	1
sunset	1
side	1
of	1
London,	1
as	1
red	1
and	1
ragged	1
as	1
a	1
cloud	1
of	1
sunset.	1
It	1
was	1
built	1
of	1
a	1
bright	1
brick	1
throughout;	1
its	1
sky-line	1
was	1
fantastic,	1
and	1
even	1
its	1
ground	1
plan	1
was	1
wild.	1
It	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
outburst	1
of	1
a	1
speculative	1
builder,	1
faintly	1
tinged	1
with	1
art,	1
who	1
called	1
its	1
architecture	1
sometimes	1
Elizabethan	1
and	1
sometimes	1
Queen	1
Anne,	1
apparently	1
under	1
the	1
impression	1
that	1
the	1
two	1
sovereigns	1
were	1
identical.	1
It	1
was	1
described	1
with	1
some	1
justice	1
as	1
an	1
artistic	1
colony,	1
though	1
it	1
never	1
in	1
any	1
definable	1
way	1
produced	1
any	1
art.	1
But	1
although	1
its	1
pretensions	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
intellectual	1
centre	1
were	1
a	1
little	1
vague,	1
its	1
pretensions	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
pleasant	1
place	1
were	1
quite	1
indisputable.	1
The	1
stranger	1
who	1
looked	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
at	1
the	1
quaint	1
red	1
houses	1
could	1
only	1
think	1
how	1
very	1
oddly	1
shaped	1
the	1
people	1
must	1
be	1
who	1
could	1
fit	1
in	1
to	1
them.	1
Nor	1
when	1
he	1
met	1
the	1
people	1
was	1
he	1
disappointed	1
in	1
this	1
respect.	1
The	1
place	1
was	1
not	1
only	1
pleasant,	1
but	1
perfect,	1
if	1
once	1
he	1
could	1
regard	1
it	1
not	1
as	1
a	1
deception	1
but	1
rather	1
as	1
a	1
dream.	1
Even	1
if	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
not	1
"artists,"	1
the	1
whole	1
was	1
nevertheless	1
artistic.	1
That	1
young	1
man	1
with	1
the	1
long,	1
auburn	1
hair	1
and	1
the	1
impudent	1
face--that	1
young	1
man	1
was	1
not	1
really	1
a	1
poet;	1
but	1
surely	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
poem.	1
That	1
old	1
gentleman	1
with	1
the	1
wild,	1
white	1
beard	1
and	1
the	1
wild,	1
white	1
hat--that	1
venerable	1
humbug	1
was	1
not	1
really	1
a	1
philosopher;	1
but	1
at	1
least	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
philosophy	1
in	1
others.	1
That	1
scientific	1
gentleman	1
with	1
the	1
bald,	1
egg-like	1
head	1
and	1
the	1
bare,	1
bird-like	1
neck	1
had	1
no	1
real	1
right	1
to	1
the	1
airs	1
of	1
science	1
that	1
he	1
assumed.	1
He	1
had	1
not	1
discovered	1
anything	1
new	1
in	1
biology;	1
but	1
what	1
biological	1
creature	1
could	1
he	1
have	1
discovered	1
more	1
singular	1
than	1
himself?	1
Thus,	1
and	1
thus	1
only,	1
the	1
whole	1
place	1
had	1
properly	1
to	1
be	1
regarded;	1
it	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
considered	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
a	1
workshop	1
for	1
artists,	1
but	1
as	1
a	1
frail	1
but	1
finished	1
work	1
of	1
art.	1
A	1
man	1
who	1
stepped	1
into	1
its	1
social	1
atmosphere	1
felt	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
stepped	1
into	1
a	1
written	1
comedy.	1
More	1
especially	1
this	1
attractive	1
unreality	1
fell	1
upon	1
it	1
about	1
nightfall,	1
when	1
the	1
extravagant	1
roofs	1
were	1
dark	1
against	1
the	1
afterglow	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
insane	1
village	1
seemed	1
as	1
separate	1
as	1
a	1
drifting	1
cloud.	1
This	1
again	1
was	1
more	1
strongly	1
true	1
of	1
the	1
many	1
nights	1
of	1
local	1
festivity,	1
when	1
the	1
little	1
gardens	1
were	1
often	1
illuminated,	1
and	1
the	1
big	1
Chinese	1
lanterns	1
glowed	1
in	1
the	1
dwarfish	1
trees	1
like	1
some	1
fierce	1
and	1
monstrous	1
fruit.	1
And	1
this	1
was	1
strongest	1
of	1
all	1
on	1
one	1
particular	1
evening,	1
still	1
vaguely	1
remembered	1
in	1
the	1
locality,	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
auburn-haired	1
poet	1
was	1
the	1
hero.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
by	1
any	1
means	1
the	1
only	1
evening	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
hero.	1
On	1
many	1
nights	1
those	1
passing	1
by	1
his	1
little	1
back	1
garden	1
might	1
hear	1
his	1
high,	1
didactic	1
voice	1
laying	1
down	1
the	1
law	1
to	1
men	1
and	1
particularly	1
to	1
women.	1
The	1
attitude	1
of	1
women	1
in	1
such	1
cases	1
was	1
indeed	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
paradoxes	1
of	1
the	1
place.	1
Most	1
of	1
the	1
women	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
kind	1
vaguely	1
called	1
emancipated,	1
and	1
professed	1
some	1
protest	1
against	1
male	1
supremacy.	1
Yet	1
these	1
new	1
women	1
would	1
always	1
pay	1
to	1
a	1
man	1
the	1
extravagant	1
compliment	1
which	1
no	1
ordinary	1
woman	1
ever	1
pays	1
to	1
him,	1
that	1
of	1
listening	1
while	1
he	1
is	1
talking.	1
And	1
Mr.	1
Lucian	1
Gregory,	1
the	1
red-haired	1
poet,	1
was	1
really	1
(in	1
some	1
sense)	1
a	1
man	1
worth	1
listening	1
to,	1
even	1
if	1
one	1
only	1
laughed	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
it.	1
He	1
put	1
the	1
old	1
cant	1
of	1
the	1
lawlessness	1
of	1
art	1
and	1
the	1
art	1
of	1
lawlessness	1
with	1
a	1
certain	1
impudent	1
freshness	1
which	1
gave	1
at	1
least	1
a	1
momentary	1
pleasure.	1
He	1
was	1
helped	1
in	1
some	1
degree	1
by	1
the	1
arresting	1
oddity	1
of	1
his	1
appearance,	1
which	1
he	1
worked,	1
as	1
the	1
phrase	1
goes,	1
for	1
all	1
it	1
was	1
worth.	1
His	1
dark	1
red	1
hair	1
parted	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
was	1
literally	1
like	1
a	1
woman's,	1
and	1
curved	1
into	1
the	1
slow	1
curls	1
of	1
a	1
virgin	1
in	1
a	1
pre-Raphaelite	1
picture.	1
From	1
within	1
this	1
almost	1
saintly	1
oval,	1
however,	1
his	1
face	1
projected	1
suddenly	1
broad	1
and	1
brutal,	1
the	1
chin	1
carried	1
forward	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
cockney	1
contempt.	1
This	1
combination	1
at	1
once	1
tickled	1
and	1
terrified	1
the	1
nerves	1
of	1
a	1
neurotic	1
population.	1
He	1
seemed	1
like	1
a	1
walking	1
blasphemy,	1
a	1
blend	1
of	1
the	1
angel	1
and	1
the	1
ape.	1
This	1
particular	1
evening,	1
if	1
it	1
is	1
remembered	1
for	1
nothing	1
else,	1
will	1
be	1
remembered	1
in	1
that	1
place	1
for	1
its	1
strange	1
sunset.	1
It	1
looked	1
like	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
All	1
the	1
heaven	1
seemed	1
covered	1
with	1
a	1
quite	1
vivid	1
and	1
palpable	1
plumage;	1
you	1
could	1
only	1
say	1
that	1
the	1
sky	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
feathers,	1
and	1
of	1
feathers	1
that	1
almost	1
brushed	1
the	1
face.	1
Across	1
the	1
great	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
dome	1
they	1
were	1
grey,	1
with	1
the	1
strangest	1
tints	1
of	1
violet	1
and	1
mauve	1
and	1
an	1
unnatural	1
pink	1
or	1
pale	1
green;	1
but	1
towards	1
the	1
west	1
the	1
whole	1
grew	1
past	1
description,	1
transparent	1
and	1
passionate,	1
and	1
the	1
last	1
red-hot	1
plumes	1
of	1
it	1
covered	1
up	1
the	1
sun	1
like	1
something	1
too	1
good	1
to	1
be	1
seen.	1
The	1
whole	1
was	1
so	1
close	1
about	1
the	1
earth,	1
as	1
to	1
express	1
nothing	1
but	1
a	1
violent	1
secrecy.	1
The	1
very	1
empyrean	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
secret.	1
It	1
expressed	1
that	1
splendid	1
smallness	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
soul	1
of	1
local	1
patriotism.	1
The	1
very	1
sky	1
seemed	1
small.	1
I	1
say	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
some	1
inhabitants	1
who	1
may	1
remember	1
the	1
evening	1
if	1
only	1
by	1
that	1
oppressive	1
sky.	1
There	1
are	1
others	1
who	1
may	1
remember	1
it	1
because	1
it	1
marked	1
the	1
first	1
appearance	1
in	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
second	1
poet	1
of	1
Saffron	1
Park.	1
For	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
the	1
red-haired	1
revolutionary	1
had	1
reigned	1
without	1
a	1
rival;	1
it	1
was	1
upon	1
the	1
night	1
of	1
the	1
sunset	1
that	1
his	1
solitude	1
suddenly	1
ended.	1
The	1
new	1
poet,	1
who	1
introduced	1
himself	1
by	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Gabriel	1
Syme	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
mild-looking	1
mortal,	1
with	1
a	1
fair,	1
pointed	1
beard	1
and	1
faint,	1
yellow	1
hair.	1
But	1
an	1
impression	1
grew	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
less	1
meek	1
than	1
he	1
looked.	1
He	1
signalised	1
his	1
entrance	1
by	1
differing	1
with	1
the	1
established	1
poet,	1
Gregory,	1
upon	1
the	1
whole	1
nature	1
of	1
poetry.	1
He	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
(Syme)	1
was	1
poet	1
of	1
law,	1
a	1
poet	1
of	1
order;	1
nay,	1
he	1
said	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
poet	1
of	1
respectability.	1
So	1
all	1
the	1
Saffron	1
Parkers	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
that	1
moment	1
fallen	1
out	1
of	1
that	1
impossible	1
sky.	1
In	1
fact,	1
Mr.	1
Lucian	1
Gregory,	1
the	1
anarchic	1
poet,	1
connected	1
the	1
two	1
events.	1
"It	1
may	1
well	1
be,"	1
he	1
said,	1
in	1
his	1
sudden	1
lyrical	1
manner,	1
"it	1
may	1
well	1
be	1
on	1
such	1
a	1
night	1
of	1
clouds	1
and	1
cruel	1
colours	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
brought	1
forth	1
upon	1
the	1
earth	1
such	1
a	1
portent	1
as	1
a	1
respectable	1
poet.	1
You	1
say	1
you	1
are	1
a	1
poet	1
of	1
law;	1
I	1
say	1
you	1
are	1
a	1
contradiction	1
in	1
terms.	1
I	1
only	1
wonder	1
there	1
were	1
not	1
comets	1
and	1
earthquakes	1
on	1
the	1
night	1
you	1
appeared	1
in	1
this	1
garden."	1
The	1
man	1
with	1
the	1
meek	1
blue	1
eyes	1
and	1
the	1
pale,	1
pointed	1
beard	1
endured	1
these	1
thunders	1
with	1
a	1
certain	1
submissive	1
solemnity.	1
The	1
third	1
party	1
of	1
the	1
group,	1
Gregory's	1
sister	1
Rosamond,	1
who	1
had	1
her	1
brother's	1
braids	1
of	1
red	1
hair,	1
but	1
a	1
kindlier	1
face	1
underneath	1
them,	1
laughed	1
with	1
such	1
mixture	1
of	1
admiration	1
and	1
disapproval	1
as	1
she	1
gave	1
commonly	1
to	1
the	1
family	1
oracle.	1
Gregory	1
resumed	1
in	1
high	1
oratorical	1
good	1
humour.	1
"An	1
artist	1
is	1
identical	1
with	1
an	1
anarchist,"	1
he	1
cried.	1
"You	1
might	1
transpose	1
the	1
words	1
anywhere.	1
An	1
anarchist	1
is	1
an	1
artist.	1
The	1
man	1
who	1
throws	1
a	1
bomb	1
is	1
an	1
artist,	1
because	1
he	1
prefers	1
a	1
great	1
moment	1
to	1
everything.	1
He	1
sees	1
how	1
much	1
more	1
valuable	1
is	1
one	1
burst	1
of	1
blazing	1
light,	1
one	1
peal	1
of	1
perfect	1
thunder,	1
than	1
the	1
mere	1
common	1
bodies	1
of	1
a	1
few	1
shapeless	1
policemen.	1
An	1
artist	1
disregards	1
all	1
governments,	1
abolishes	1
all	1
conventions.	1
The	1
poet	1
delights	1
in	1
disorder	1
only.	1
If	1
it	1
were	1
not	1
so,	1
the	1
most	1
poetical	1
thing	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
Underground	1
Railway."	1
"So	1
it	1
is,"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Syme.	1
"Nonsense!"	1
said	1
Gregory,	1
who	1
was	1
very	1
rational	1
when	1
anyone	1
else	1
attempted	1
paradox.	1
"Why	1
do	1
all	1
the	1
clerks	1
and	1
navvies	1
in	1
the	1
railway	1
trains	1
look	1
so	1
sad	1
and	1
tired,	1
so	1
very	1
sad	1
and	1
tired?	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
you.	1
It	1
is	1
because	1
they	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
train	1
is	1
going	1
right.	1
It	1
is	1
because	1
they	1
know	1
that	1
whatever	1
place	1
they	1
have	1
taken	1
a	1
ticket	1
for	1
that	1
place	1
they	1
will	1
reach.	1
It	1
is	1
because	1
after	1
they	1
have	1
passed	1
Sloane	1
Square	1
they	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
next	1
station	1
must	1
be	1
Victoria,	1
and	1
nothing	1
but	1
Victoria.	1
Oh,	1
their	1
wild	1
rapture!	1
oh,	1
their	1
eyes	1
like	1
stars	1
and	1
their	1
souls	1
again	1
in	1
Eden,	1
if	1
the	1
next	1
station	1
were	1
unaccountably	1
Baker	1
Street!"	1
"It	1
is	1
you	1
who	1
are	1
unpoetical,"	1
replied	1
the	1
poet	1
Syme.	1
"If	1
what	1
you	1
say	1
of	1
clerks	1
is	1
true,	1
they	1
can	1
only	1
be	1
as	1
prosaic	1
as	1
your	1
poetry.	1
The	1
rare,	1
strange	1
thing	1
is	1
to	1
hit	1
the	1
mark;	1
the	1
gross,	1
obvious	1
thing	1
is	1
to	1
miss	1
it.	1
We	1
feel	1
it	1
is	1
epical	1
when	1
man	1
with	1
one	1
wild	1
arrow	1
strikes	1
a	1
distant	1
bird.	1
Is	1
it	1
not	1
also	1
epical	1
when	1
man	1
with	1
one	1
wild	1
engine	1
strikes	1
a	1
distant	1
station?	1
Chaos	1
is	1
dull;	1
because	1
in	1
chaos	1
the	1
train	1
might	1
indeed	1
go	1
anywhere,	1
to	1
Baker	1
Street	1
or	1
to	1
Bagdad.	1
But	1
man	1
is	1
a	1
magician,	1
and	1
his	1
whole	1
magic	1
is	1
in	1
this,	1
that	1
he	1
does	1
say	1
Victoria,	1
and	1
lo!	1
it	1
is	1
Victoria.	1
No,	1
take	1
your	1
books	1
of	1
mere	1
poetry	1
and	1
prose;	1
let	1
me	1
read	1
a	1
time	1
table,	1
with	1
tears	1
of	1
pride.	1
Take	1
your	1
Byron,	1
who	1
commemorates	1
the	1
defeats	1
of	1
man;	1
give	1
me	1
Bradshaw,	1
who	1
commemorates	1
his	1
victories.	1
Give	1
me	1
Bradshaw,	1
I	1
say!"	1
"Must	1
you	1
go?"	1
inquired	1
Gregory	1
sarcastically.	1
"I	1
tell	1
you,"	1
went	1
on	1
Syme	1
with	1
passion,	1
"that	1
every	1
time	1
a	1
train	1
comes	1
in	1
I	1
feel	1
that	1
it	1
has	1
broken	1
past	1
batteries	1
of	1
besiegers,	1
and	1
that	1
man	1
has	1
won	1
a	1
battle	1
against	1
chaos.	1
You	1
say	1
contemptuously	1
that	1
when	1
one	1
has	1
left	1
Sloane	1
Square	1
one	1
must	1
come	1
to	1
Victoria.	1
I	1
say	1
that	1
one	1
might	1
do	1
a	1
thousand	1
things	1
instead,	1
and	1
that	1
whenever	1
I	1
really	1
come	1
there	1
I	1
have	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
hairbreadth	1
escape.	1
And	1
when	1
I	1
hear	1
the	1
guard	1
shout	1
out	1
the	1
word	1
'Victoria,'	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
an	1
unmeaning	1
word.	1
It	1
is	1
to	1
me	1
the	1
cry	1
of	1
a	1
herald	1
announcing	1
conquest.	1
It	1
is	1
to	1
me	1
indeed	1
'Victoria';	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
victory	1
of	1
Adam."	1
Gregory	1
wagged	1
his	1
heavy,	1
red	1
head	1
with	1
a	1
slow	1
and	1
sad	1
smile.	1
"And	1
even	1
then,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"we	1
poets	1
always	1
ask	1
the	1
question,	1
'And	1
what	1
is	1
Victoria	1
now	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
got	1
there	1
?'	1
You	1
think	1
Victoria	1
is	1
like	1
the	1
New	1
Jerusalem.	1
We	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
New	1
Jerusalem	1
will	1
only	1
be	1
like	1
Victoria.	1
Yes,	1
the	1
poet	1
will	1
be	1
discontented	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
streets	1
of	1
heaven.	1
The	1
poet	1
is	1
always	1
in	1
revolt."	1
"There	1
again,"	1
said	1
Syme	1
irritably,	1
"what	1
is	1
there	1
poetical	1
about	1
being	1
in	1
revolt	1
?	1
You	1
might	1
as	1
well	1
say	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
poetical	1
to	1
be	1
sea-sick.	1
Being	1
sick	1
is	1
a	1
revolt.	1
Both	1
being	1
sick	1
and	1
being	1
rebellious	1
may	1
be	1
the	1
wholesome	1
thing	1
on	1
certain	1
desperate	1
occasions;	1
but	1
I'm	1
hanged	1
if	1
I	1
can	1
see	1
why	1
they	1
are	1
poetical.	1
Revolt	1
in	1
the	1
abstract	1
is--revolting.	1
It's	1
mere	1
vomiting."	1
The	1
girl	1
winced	1
for	1
a	1
flash	1
at	1
the	1
unpleasant	1
word,	1
but	1
Syme	1
was	1
too	1
hot	1
to	1
heed	1
her.	1
"It	1
is	1
things	1
going	1
right,"	1
he	1
cried,	1
"that	1
is	1
poetical	1
I	1
Our	1
digestions,	1
for	1
instance,	1
going	1
sacredly	1
and	1
silently	1
right,	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
all	1
poetry.	1
Yes,	1
the	1
most	1
poetical	1
thing,	1
more	1
poetical	1
than	1
the	1
flowers,	1
more	1
poetical	1
than	1
the	1
stars--the	1
most	1
poetical	1
thing	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
is	1
not	1
being	1
sick."	1
"Really,"	1
said	1
Gregory	1
superciliously,	1
"the	1
examples	1
you	1
choose--"	1
"I	1
beg	1
your	1
pardon,"	1
said	1
Syme	1
grimly,	1
"I	1
forgot	1
we	1
had	1
abolished	1
all	1
conventions."	1
For	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
a	1
red	1
patch	1
appeared	1
on	1
Gregory's	1
forehead.	1
"You	1
don't	1
expect	1
me,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"to	1
revolutionise	1
society	1
on	1
this	1
lawn	1
?"	1
Syme	1
looked	1
straight	1
into	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
smiled	1
sweetly.	1
"No,	1
I	1
don't,"	1
he	1
said;	1
"but	1
I	1
suppose	1
that	1
if	1
you	1
were	1
serious	1
about	1
your	1
anarchism,	1
that	1
is	1
exactly	1
what	1
you	1
would	1
do."	1
Gregory's	1
big	1
bull's	1
eyes	1
blinked	1
suddenly	1
like	1
those	1
of	1
an	1
angry	1
lion,	1
and	1
one	1
could	1
almost	1
fancy	1
that	1
his	1
red	1
mane	1
rose.	1
"Don't	1
you	1
think,	1
then,"	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
dangerous	1
voice,	1
"that	1
I	1
am	1
serious	1
about	1
my	1
anarchism?"	1
"I	1
beg	1
your	1
pardon	1
?"	1
said	1
Syme.	1
"Am	1
I	1
not	1
serious	1
about	1
my	1
anarchism	1
?"	1
cried	1
Gregory,	1
with	1
knotted	1
fists.	1
"My	1
dear	1
fellow!"	1
said	1
Syme,	1
and	1
strolled	1
away.	1
With	1
surprise,	1
but	1
with	1
a	1
curious	1
pleasure,	1
he	1
found	1
Rosamond	1
Gregory	1
still	1
in	1
his	1
company.	1
"Mr.	1
Syme,"	1
she	1
said,	1
"do	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
talk	1
like	1
you	1
and	1
my	1
brother	1
often	1
mean	1
what	1
they	1
say	1
?	1
Do	1
you	1
mean	1
what	1
you	1
say	1
now	1
?"	1
Syme	1
smiled.	1
"Do	1
you	1
?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
mean	1
?"	1
asked	1
the	1
girl,	1
with	1
grave	1
eyes.	1
"My	1
dear	1
Miss	1
Gregory,"	1
said	1
Syme	1
gently,	1
"there	1
are	1
many	1
kinds	1
of	1
sincerity	1
and	1
insincerity.	1
When	1
you	1
say	1
'thank	1
you'	1
for	1
the	1
salt,	1
do	1
you	1
mean	1
what	1
you	1
say	1
?	1
No.	1
When	1
you	1
say	1
'the	1
world	1
is	1
round,'	1
do	1
you	1
mean	1
what	1
you	1
say	1
?	1
No.	1
It	1
is	1
true,	1
but	1
you	1
don't	1
mean	1
it.	1
Now,	1
sometimes	1
a	1
man	1
like	1
your	1
brother	1
really	1
finds	1
a	1
thing	1
he	1
does	1
mean.	1
It	1
may	1
be	1
only	1
a	1
half-truth,	1
quarter-truth,	1
tenth-truth;	1
but	1
then	1
he	1
says	1
more	1
than	1
he	1
means--from	1
sheer	1
force	1
of	1
meaning	1
it."	1
She	1
was	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
from	1
under	1
level	1
brows;	1
her	1
face	1
was	1
grave	1
and	1
open,	1
and	1
there	1
had	1
fallen	1
upon	1
it	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
that	1
unreasoning	1
responsibility	1
which	1
is	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
frivolous	1
woman,	1
the	1
maternal	1
watch	1
which	1
is	1
as	1
old	1
as	1
the	1
world.	1
"Is	1
he	1
really	1
an	1
anarchist,	1
then?"	1
she	1
asked.	1
"Only	1
in	1
that	1
sense	1
I	1
speak	1
of,"	1
replied	1
Syme;	1
"or	1
if	1
you	1
prefer	1
it,	1
in	1
that	1
nonsense."	1
She	1
drew	1
her	1
broad	1
brows	1
together	1
and	1
said	1
abruptly--	1
"He	1
wouldn't	1
really	1
use--bombs	1
or	1
that	1
sort	1
of	1
thing?"	1
Syme	1
broke	1
into	1
a	1
great	1
laugh,	1
that	1
seemed	1
too	1
large	1
for	1
his	1
slight	1
and	1
somewhat	1
dandified	1
figure.	1
"Good	1
Lord,	1
no!"	1
he	1
said,	1
"that	1
has	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
anonymously."	1
And	1
at	1
that	1
the	1
corners	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
mouth	1
broke	1
into	1
a	1
smile,	1
and	1
she	1
thought	1
with	1
a	1
simultaneous	1
pleasure	1
of	1
Gregory's	1
absurdity	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
safety.	1
Syme	1
strolled	1
with	1
her	1
to	1
a	1
seat	1
in	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
garden,	1
and	1
continued	1
to	1
pour	1
out	1
his	1
opinions.	1
For	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
sincere	1
man,	1
and	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
superficial	1
airs	1
and	1
graces,	1
at	1
root	1
a	1
humble	1
one.	1
And	1
it	1
is	1
always	1
the	1
humble	1
man	1
who	1
talks	1
too	1
much;	1
the	1
proud	1
man	1
watches	1
himself	1
too	1
closely.	1
He	1
defended	1
respectability	1
with	1
violence	1
and	1
exaggeration.	1
He	1
grew	1
passionate	1
in	1
his	1
praise	1
of	1
tidiness	1
and	1
propriety.	1
All	1
the	1
time	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
smell	1
of	1
lilac	1
all	1
round	1
him.	1
Once	1
he	1
heard	1
very	1
faintly	1
in	1
some	1
distant	1
street	1
a	1
barrel-organ	1
begin	1
to	1
play,	1
and	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
his	1
heroic	1
words	1
were	1
moving	1
to	1
a	1
tiny	1
tune	1
from	1
under	1
or	1
beyond	1
the	1
world.	1
He	1
stared	1
and	1
talked	1
at	1
the	1
girl's	1
red	1
hair	1
and	1
amused	1
face	1
for	1
what	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
few	1
minutes;	1
and	1
then,	1
feeling	1
that	1
the	1
groups	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
place	1
should	1
mix,	1
rose	1
to	1
his	1
feet.	1
To	1
his	1
astonishment,	1
he	1
discovered	1
the	1
whole	1
garden	1
empty.	1
Everyone	1
had	1
gone	1
long	1
ago,	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
himself	1
with	1
a	1
rather	1
hurried	1
apology.	1
He	1
left	1
with	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
champagne	1
in	1
his	1
head,	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
afterwards	1
explain.	1
In	1
the	1
wild	1
events	1
which	1
were	1
to	1
follow	1
this	1
girl	1
had	1
no	1
part	1
at	1
all;	1
he	1
never	1
saw	1
her	1
again	1
until	1
all	1
his	1
tale	1
was	1
over.	1
And	1
yet,	1
in	1
some	1
indescribable	1
way,	1
she	1
kept	1
recurring	1
like	1
a	1
motive	1
in	1
music	1
through	1
all	1
his	1
mad	1
adventures	1
afterwards,	1
and	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
her	1
strange	1
hair	1
ran	1
like	1
a	1
red	1
thread	1
through	1
those	1
dark	1
and	1
ill-drawn	1
tapestries	1
of	1
the	1
night.	1
For	1
what	1
followed	1
was	1
so	1
improbable,	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
well	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
dream.	1
When	1
Syme	1
went	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
starlit	1
street,	1
he	1
found	1
it	1
for	1
the	1
moment	1
empty.	1
Then	1
he	1
realised	1
(in	1
some	1
odd	1
way)	1
that	1
the	1
silence	1
was	1
rather	1
a	1
living	1
silence	1
than	1
a	1
dead	1
one.	1
Directly	1
outside	1
the	1
door	1
stood	1
a	1
street	1
lamp,	1
whose	1
gleam	1
gilded	1
the	1
leaves	1
of	1
the	1
tree	1
that	1
bent	1
out	1
over	1
the	1
fence	1
behind	1
him.	1
About	1
a	1
foot	1
from	1
the	1
lamp-post	1
stood	1
a	1
figure	1
almost	1
as	1
rigid	1
and	1
motionless	1
as	1
the	1
lamp-post	1
itself.	1
The	1
tall	1
hat	1
and	1
long	1
frock	1
coat	1
were	1
black;	1
the	1
face,	1
in	1
an	1
abrupt	1
shadow,	1
was	1
almost	1
as	1
dark.	1
Only	1
a	1
fringe	1
of	1
fiery	1
hair	1
against	1
the	1
light,	1
and	1
also	1
something	1
aggressive	1
in	1
the	1
attitude,	1
proclaimed	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
poet	1
Gregory.	1
He	1
had	1
something	1
of	1
the	1
look	1
of	1
a	1
masked	1
bravo	1
waiting	1
sword	1
in	1
hand	1
for	1
his	1
foe.	1
He	1
made	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
doubtful	1
salute,	1
which	1
Syme	1
somewhat	1
more	1
formally	1
returned.	1
"I	1
was	1
waiting	1
for	1
you,"	1
said	1
Gregory.	1
"Might	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
moment's	1
conversation?"	1
"Certainly.	1
About	1
what?"	1
asked	1
Syme	1
in	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
weak	1
wonder.	1
Gregory	1
struck	1
out	1
with	1
his	1
stick	1
at	1
the	1
lamp-post,	1
and	1
then	1
at	1
the	1
tree.	1
"About	1
this	1
and	1
this,"	1
he	1
cried;	1
"about	1
order	1
and	1
anarchy.	1
There	1
is	1
your	1
precious	1
order,	1
that	1
lean,	1
iron	1
lamp,	1
ugly	1
and	1
barren;	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
anarchy,	1
rich,	1
living,	1
reproducing	1
itself--there	1
is	1
anarchy,	1
splendid	1
in	1
green	1
and	1
gold."	1
"All	1
the	1
same,"	1
replied	1
Syme	1
patiently,	1
"just	1
at	1
present	1
you	1
only	1
see	1
the	1
tree	1
by	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
lamp.	1
I	1
wonder	1
when	1
you	1
would	1
ever	1
see	1
the	1
lamp	1
by	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
tree."	1
Then	1
after	1
a	1
pause	1
he	1
said,	1
"But	1
may	1
I	1
ask	1
if	1
you	1
have	1
been	1
standing	1
out	1
here	1
in	1
the	1
dark	1
only	1
to	1
resume	1
our	1
little	1
argument?"	1
"No,"	1
cried	1
out	1
Gregory,	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
that	1
rang	1
down	1
the	1
street,	1
"I	1
did	1
not	1
stand	1
here	1
to	1
resume	1
our	1
argument,	1
but	1
to	1
end	1
it	1
for	1
ever."	1
The	1
silence	1
fell	1
again,	1
and	1
Syme,	1
though	1
he	1
understood	1
nothing,	1
listened	1
instinctively	1
for	1
something	1
serious.	1
Gregory	1
began	1
in	1
a	1
smooth	1
voice	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
rather	1
bewildering	1
smile.	1
"Mr.	1
Syme,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"this	1
evening	1
you	1
succeeded	1
in	1
doing	1
something	1
rather	1
remarkable.	1
You	1
did	1
something	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
no	1
man	1
born	1
of	1
woman	1
has	1
ever	1
succeeded	1
in	1
doing	1
before."	1
"Indeed!"	1
"Now	1
I	1
remember,"	1
resumed	1
Gregory	1
reflectively,	1
"one	1
other	1
person	1
succeeded	1
in	1
doing	1
it.	1
The	1
captain	1
of	1
a	1
penny	1
steamer	1
(if	1
I	1
remember	1
correctly)	1
at	1
Southend.	1
You	1
have	1
irritated	1
me."	1
"I	1
am	1
very	1
sorry,"	1
replied	1
Syme	1
with	1
gravity.	1
"I	1
am	1
afraid	1
my	1
fury	1
and	1
your	1
insult	1
are	1
too	1
shocking	1
to	1
be	1
wiped	1
out	1
even	1
with	1
an	1
apology,"	1
said	1
Gregory	1
very	1
calmly.	1
"No	1
duel	1
could	1
wipe	1
it	1
out.	1
If	1
I	1
struck	1
you	1
dead	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
wipe	1
it	1
out.	1
There	1
is	1
only	1
one	1
way	1
by	1
which	1
that	1
insult	1
can	1
be	1
erased,	1
and	1
that	1
way	1
I	1
choose.	1
I	1
am	1
going,	1
at	1
the	1
possible	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
my	1
life	1
and	1
honour,	1
to	1
prove	1
to	1
you	1
that	1
you	1
were	1
wrong	1
in	1
what	1
you	1
said."	1
"In	1
what	1
I	1
said?"	1
"You	1
said	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
serious	1
about	1
being	1
an	1
anarchist."	1
"There	1
are	1
degrees	1
of	1
seriousness,"	1
replied	1
Syme.	1
"I	1
have	1
never	1
doubted	1
that	1
you	1
were	1
perfectly	1
sincere	1
in	1
this	1
sense,	1
that	1
you	1
thought	1
what	1
you	1
said	1
well	1
worth	1
saying,	1
that	1
you	1
thought	1
a	1
paradox	1
might	1
wake	1
men	1
up	1
to	1
a	1
neglected	1
truth."	1
Gregory	1
stared	1
at	1
him	1
steadily	1
and	1
painfully.	1
"And	1
in	1
no	1
other	1
sense,"	1
he	1
asked,	1
"you	1
think	1
me	1
serious?	1
You	1
think	1
me	1
a	1
flaneur	1
who	1
lets	1
fall	1
occasional	1
truths.	1
You	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
that	1
in	1
a	1
deeper,	1
a	1
more	1
deadly	1
sense,	1
I	1
am	1
serious."	1
Syme	1
struck	1
his	1
stick	1
violently	1
on	1
the	1
stones	1
of	1
the	1
road.	1
"Serious!"	1
he	1
cried.	1
"Good	1
Lord!	1
is	1
this	1
street	1
serious?	1
Are	1
these	1
damned	1
Chinese	1
lanterns	1
serious?	1
Is	1
the	1
whole	1
caboodle	1
serious?	1
One	1
comes	1
here	1
and	1
talks	1
a	1
pack	1
of	1
bosh,	1
and	1
perhaps	1
some	1
sense	1
as	1
well,	1
but	1
I	1
should	1
think	1
very	1
little	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
didn't	1
keep	1
something	1
in	1
the	1
background	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
that	1
was	1
more	1
serious	1
than	1
all	1
this	1
talking--something	1
more	1
serious,	1
whether	1
it	1
was	1
religion	1
or	1
only	1
drink."	1
"Very	1
well,"	1
said	1
Gregory,	1
his	1
face	1
darkening,	1
"you	1
shall	1
see	1
something	1
more	1
serious	1
than	1
either	1
drink	1
or	1
religion."	1
Syme	1
stood	1
waiting	1
with	1
his	1
usual	1
air	1
of	1
mildness	1
until	1
Gregory	1
again	1
opened	1
his	1
lips.	1
"You	1
spoke	1
just	1
now	1
of	1
having	1
a	1
religion.	1
Is	1
it	1
really	1
true	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
one?"	1
"Oh,"	1
said	1
Syme	1
with	1
a	1
beaming	1
smile,	1
"we	1
are	1
all	1
Catholics	1
now."	1
"Then	1
may	1
I	1
ask	1
you	1
to	1
swear	1
by	1
whatever	1
gods	1
or	1
saints	1
your	1
religion	1
involves	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
reveal	1
what	1
I	1
am	1
now	1
going	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
to	1
any	1
son	1
of	1
Adam,	1
and	1
especially	1
not	1
to	1
the	1
police?	1
Will	1
you	1
swear	1
that!	1
If	1
you	1
will	1
take	1
upon	1
yourself	1
this	1
awful	1
abnegations	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
consent	1
to	1
burden	1
your	1
soul	1
with	1
a	1
vow	1
that	1
you	1
should	1
never	1
make	1
and	1
a	1
knowledge	1
you	1
should	1
never	1
dream	1
about,	1
I	1
will	1
promise	1
you	1
in	1
return--"	1
"You	1
will	1
promise	1
me	1
in	1
return?"	1
inquired	1
Syme,	1
as	1
the	1
other	1
paused.	1
"I	1
will	1
promise	1
you	1
a	1
very	1
entertaining	1
evening."	1
Syme	1
suddenly	1
took	1
off	1
his	1
hat.	1
"Your	1
offer,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"is	1
far	1
too	1
idiotic	1
to	1
be	1
declined.	1
You	1
say	1
that	1
a	1
poet	1
is	1
always	1
an	1
anarchist.	1
I	1
disagree;	1
but	1
I	1
hope	1
at	1
least	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
always	1
a	1
sportsman.	1
Permit	1
me,	1
here	1
and	1
now,	1
to	1
swear	1
as	1
a	1
Christian,	1
and	1
promise	1
as	1
a	1
good	1
comrade	1
and	1
a	1
fellow-artist,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
report	1
anything	1
of	1
this,	1
whatever	1
it	1
is,	1
to	1
the	1
police.	1
And	1
now,	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Colney	1
Hatch,	1
what	1
is	1
it?"	1
"I	1
think,"	1
said	1
Gregory,	1
with	1
placid	1
irrelevancy,	1
"that	1
we	1
will	1
call	1
a	1
cab."	1
He	1
gave	1
two	1
long	1
whistles,	1
and	1
a	1
hansom	1
came	1
rattling	1
down	1
the	1
road.	1
The	1
two	1
got	1
into	1
it	1
in	1
silence.	1
Gregory	1
gave	1
through	1
the	1
trap	1
the	1
address	1
of	1
an	1
obscure	1
public-house	1
on	1
the	1
Chiswick	1
bank	1
of	1
the	1
river.	1
The	1
cab	1
whisked	1
itself	1
away	1
again,	1
and	1
in	1
it	1
these	1
two	1
fantastics	1
quitted	1
their	1
fantastic	1
town.	1
CHAPTER	1
II	1
THE	1
SECRET	1
OF	1
GABRIEL	1
SYME	1
THE	1
cab	1
pulled	1
up	1
before	1
a	1
particularly	1
dreary	1
and	1
greasy	1
beershop,	1
into	1
which	1
Gregory	1
rapidly	1
conducted	1
his	1
companion.	1
They	1
seated	1
themselves	1
in	1
a	1
close	1
and	1
dim	1
sort	1
of	1
bar-parlour,	1
at	1
a	1
stained	1
wooden	1
table	1
with	1
one	1
wooden	1
leg.	1
The	1
room	1
was	1
so	1
small	1
and	1
dark,	1
that	1
very	1
little	1
could	1
be	1
seen	1
of	1
the	1
attendant	1
who	1
was	1
summoned,	1
beyond	1
a	1
vague	1
and	1
dark	1
impression	1
of	1
something	1
bulky	1
and	1
bearded.	1
"Will	1
you	1
take	1
a	1
little	1
supper?"	1
asked	1
Gregory	1
politely.	1
"The	1
pate	1
de	1
foie	1
gras	1
is	1
not	1
good	1
here,	1
but	1
I	1
can	1
recommend	1
the	1
game."	1
Syme	1
received	1
the	1
remark	1
with	1
stolidity,	1
imagining	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
joke.	1
Accepting	1
the	1
vein	1
of	1
humour,	1
he	1
said,	1
with	1
a	1
well-bred	1
indifference--	1
"Oh,	1
bring	1
me	1
some	1
lobster	1
mayonnaise."	1
To	1
his	1
indescribable	1
astonishment,	1
the	1
man	1
only	1
said	1
"Certainly,	1
sir!"	1
and	1
went	1
away	1
apparently	1
to	1
get	1
it.	1
"What	1
will	1
you	1
drink?"	1
resumed	1
Gregory,	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
careless	1
yet	1
apologetic	1
air.	1
"I	1
shall	1
only	1
have	1
a	1
crepe	1
de	1
menthe	1
myself;	1
I	1
have	1
dined.	1
But	1
the	1
champagne	1
can	1
really	1
be	1
trusted.	1
Do	1
let	1
me	1
start	1
you	1
with	1
a	1
half-bottle	1
of	1
Pommery	1
at	1
least?"	1
"Thank	1
you!"	1
said	1
the	1
motionless	1
Syme.	1
"You	1
are	1
very	1
good."	1
His	1
further	1
attempts	1
at	1
conversation,	1
somewhat	1
disorganised	1
in	1
themselves,	1
were	1
cut	1
short	1
finally	1
as	1
by	1
a	1
thunderbolt	1
by	1
the	1
actual	1
appearance	1
of	1
the	1
lobster.	1
Syme	1
tasted	1
it,	1
and	1
found	1
it	1
particularly	1
good.	1
Then	1
he	1
suddenly	1
began	1
to	1
eat	1
with	1
great	1
rapidity	1
and	1
appetite.	1
"Excuse	1
me	1
if	1
I	1
enjoy	1
myself	1
rather	1
obviously!"	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
Gregory,	1
smiling.	1
"I	1
don't	1
often	1
have	1
the	1
luck	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
dream	1
like	1
this.	1
It	1
is	1
new	1
to	1
me	1
for	1
a	1
nightmare	1
to	1
lead	1
to	1
a	1
lobster.	1
It	1
is	1
commonly	1
the	1
other	1
way."	1
"You	1
are	1
not	1
asleep,	1
I	1
assure	1
you,"	1
said	1
Gregory.	1
"You	1
are,	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
most	1
actual	1
and	1
rousing	1
moment	1
of	1
your	1
existence.	1
Ah,	1
here	1
comes	1
your	1
champagne!	1
I	1
admit	1
that	1
there	1
may	1
be	1
a	1
slight	1
disproportion,	1
let	1
us	1
say,	1
between	1
the	1
inner	1
arrangements	1
of	1
this	1
excellent	1
hotel	1
and	1
its	1
simple	1
and	1
unpretentious	1
exterior.	1
But	1
that	1
is	1
all	1
our	1
modesty.	1
We	1
are	1
the	1
most	1
modest	1
men	1
that	1
ever	1
lived	1
on	1
earth."	1
"And	1
who	1
are	1
we?"	1
asked	1
Syme,	1
emptying	1
his	1
champagne	1
glass.	1
"It	1
is	1
quite	1
simple,"	1
replied	1
Gregory.	1
"We	1
are	1
the	1
serious	1
anarchists,	1
in	1
whom	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
believe."	1
"Oh!"	1
said	1
Syme	1
shortly.	1
"You	1
do	1
yourselves	1
well	1
in	1
drinks."	1
"Yes,	1
we	1
are	1
serious	1
about	1
everything,"	1
answered	1
Gregory.	1
Then	1
after	1
a	1
pause	1
he	1
added--	1
"If	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
moments	1
this	1
table	1
begins	1
to	1
turn	1
round	1
a	1
little,	1
don't	1
put	1
it	1
down	1
to	1
your	1
inroads	1
into	1
the	1
champagne.	1
I	1
don't	1
wish	1
you	1
to	1
do	1
yourself	1
an	1
injustice."	1
"Well,	1
if	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
drunk,	1
I	1
am	1
mad,"	1
replied	1
Syme	1
with	1
perfect	1
calm;	1
"but	1
I	1
trust	1
I	1
can	1
behave	1
like	1
a	1
gentleman	1
in	1
either	1
condition.	1
May	1
I	1
smoke?"	1
"Certainly!"	1
said	1
Gregory,	1
producing	1
a	1
cigar-case.	1
"Try	1
one	1
of	1
mine."	1
Syme	1
took	1
the	1
cigar,	1
clipped	1
the	1
end	1
off	1
with	1
a	1
cigar-cutter	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
waistcoat	1
pocket,	1
put	1
it	1
in	1
his	1
mouth,	1
lit	1
it	1
slowly,	1
and	1
let	1
out	1
a	1
long	1
cloud	1
of	1
smoke.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
little	1
to	1
his	1
credit	1
that	1
he	1
performed	1
these	1
rites	1
with	1
so	1
much	1
composure,	1
for	1
almost	1
before	1
he	1
had	1
begun	1
them	1
the	1
table	1
at	1
which	1
he	1
sat	1
had	1
begun	1
to	1
revolve,	1
first	1
slowly,	1
and	1
then	1
rapidly,	1
as	1
if	1
at	1
an	1
insane	1
seance.	1
"You	1
must	1
not	1
mind	1
it,"	1
said	1
Gregory;	1
"it's	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
screw."	1
"Quite	1
so,"	1
said	1
Syme	1
placidly,	1
"a	1
kind	1
of	1
screw.	1
How	1
simple	1
that	1
is!"	1
The	1
next	1
moment	1
the	1
smoke	1
of	1
his	1
cigar,	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
wavering	1
across	1
the	1
room	1
in	1
snaky	1
twists,	1
went	1
straight	1
up	1
as	1
if	1
from	1
a	1
factory	1
chimney,	1
and	1
the	1
two,	1
with	1
their	1
chairs	1
and	1
table,	1
shot	1
down	1
through	1
the	1
floor	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
earth	1
had	1
swallowed	1
them.	1
They	1
went	1
rattling	1
down	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
roaring	1
chimney	1
as	1
rapidly	1
as	1
a	1
lift	1
cut	1
loose,	1
and	1
they	1
came	1
with	1
an	1
abrupt	1
bump	1
to	1
the	1
bottom.	1
But	1
when	1
Gregory	1
threw	1
open	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
doors	1
and	1
let	1
in	1
a	1
red	1
subterranean	1
light,	1
Syme	1
was	1
still	1
smoking	1
with	1
one	1
leg	1
thrown	1
over	1
the	1
other,	1
and	1
had	1
not	1
turned	1
a	1
yellow	1
hair.	1
Gregory	1
led	1
him	1
down	1
a	1
low,	1
vaulted	1
passage,	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
which	1
was	1
the	1
red	1
light.	1
It	1
was	1
an	1
enormous	1
crimson	1
lantern,	1
nearly	1
as	1
big	1
as	1
a	1
fireplace,	1
fixed	1
over	1
a	1
small	1
but	1
heavy	1
iron	1
door.	1
In	1
the	1
door	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
hatchway	1
or	1
grating,	1
and	1
on	1
this	1
Gregory	1
struck	1
five	1
times.	1
A	1
heavy	1
voice	1
with	1
a	1
foreign	1
accent	1
asked	1
him	1
who	1
he	1
was.	1
To	1
this	1
he	1
gave	1
the	1
more	1
or	1
less	1
unexpected	1
reply,	1
"Mr.	1
Joseph	1
Chamberlain."	1
The	1
heavy	1
hinges	1
began	1
to	1
move;	1
it	1
was	1
obviously	1
some	1
kind	1
of	1
password.	1
Inside	1
the	1
doorway	1
the	1
passage	1
gleamed	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
lined	1
with	1
a	1
network	1
of	1
steel.	1
On	1
a	1
second	1
glance,	1
Syme	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
glittering	1
pattern	1
was	1
really	1
made	1
up	1
of	1
ranks	1
and	1
ranks	1
of	1
rifles	1
and	1
revolvers,	1
closely	1
packed	1
or	1
interlocked.	1
"I	1
must	1
ask	1
you	1
to	1
forgive	1
me	1
all	1
these	1
formalities,"	1
said	1
Gregory;	1
"we	1
have	1
to	1
be	1
very	1
strict	1
here."	1
"Oh,	1
don't	1
apologise,"	1
said	1
Syme.	1
"I	1
know	1
your	1
passion	1
for	1
law	1
and	1
order,"	1
and	1
he	1
stepped	1
into	1
the	1
passage	1
lined	1
with	1
the	1
steel	1
weapons.	1
With	1
his	1
long,	1
fair	1
hair	1
and	1
rather	1
foppish	1
frock-coat,	1
he	1
looked	1
a	1
singularly	1
frail	1
and	1
fanciful	1
figure	1
as	1
he	1
walked	1
down	1
that	1
shining	1
avenue	1
of	1
death.	1
They	1
passed	1
through	1
several	1
such	1
passages,	1
and	1
came	1
out	1
at	1
last	1
into	1
a	1
queer	1
steel	1
chamber	1
with	1
curved	1
walls,	1
almost	1
spherical	1
in	1
shape,	1
but	1
presenting,	1
with	1
its	1
tiers	1
of	1
benches,	1
something	1
of	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
a	1
scientific	1
lecture-theatre.	1
There	1
were	1
no	1
rifles	1
or	1
pistols	1
in	1
this	1
apartment,	1
but	1
round	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
it	1
were	1
hung	1
more	1
dubious	1
and	1
dreadful	1
shapes,	1
things	1
that	1
looked	1
like	1
the	1
bulbs	1
of	1
iron	1
plants,	1
or	1
the	1
eggs	1
of	1
iron	1
birds.	1
They	1
were	1
bombs,	1
and	1
the	1
very	1
room	1
itself	1
seemed	1
like	1
the	1
inside	1
of	1
a	1
bomb.	1
Syme	1
knocked	1
his	1
cigar	1
ash	1
off	1
against	1
the	1
wall,	1
and	1
went	1
in.	1
"And	1
now,	1
my	1
dear	1
Mr.	1
Syme,"	1
said	1
Gregory,	1
throwing	1
himself	1
in	1
an	1
expansive	1
manner	1
on	1
the	1
bench	1
under	1
the	1
largest	1
bomb,	1
"now	1
we	1
are	1
quite	1
cosy,	1
so	1
let	1
us	1
talk	1
properly.	1
Now	1
no	1
human	1
words	1
can	1
give	1
you	1
any	1
notion	1
of	1
why	1
I	1
brought	1
you	1
here.	1
It	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
quite	1
arbitrary	1
emotions,	1
like	1
jumping	1
off	1
a	1
cliff	1
or	1
falling	1
in	1
love.	1
Suffice	1
it	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
you	1
were	1
an	1
inexpressibly	1
irritating	1
fellow,	1
and,	1
to	1
do	1
you	1
justice,	1
you	1
are	1
still.	1
I	1
would	1
break	1
twenty	1
oaths	1
of	1
secrecy	1
for	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
taking	1
you	1
down	1
a	1
peg.	1
That	1
way	1
you	1
have	1
of	1
lighting	1
a	1
cigar	1
would	1
make	1
a	1
priest	1
break	1
the	1
seal	1
of	1
confession.	1
Well,	1
you	1
said	1
that	1
you	1
were	1
quite	1
certain	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
serious	1
anarchist.	1
Does	1
this	1
place	1
strike	1
you	1
as	1
being	1
serious?"	1
"It	1
does	1
seem	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
moral	1
under	1
all	1
its	1
gaiety,"	1
assented	1
Syme;	1
"but	1
may	1
I	1
ask	1
you	1
two	1
questions?	1
You	1
need	1
not	1
fear	1
to	1
give	1
me	1
information,	1
because,	1
as	1
you	1
remember,	1
you	1
very	1
wisely	1
extorted	1
from	1
me	1
a	1
promise	1
not	1
to	1
tell	1
the	1
police,	1
a	1
promise	1
I	1
shall	1
certainly	1
keep.	1
So	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
mere	1
curiosity	1
that	1
I	1
make	1
my	1
queries.	1
First	1
of	1
all,	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
really	1
all	1
about?	1
What	1
is	1
it	1
you	1
object	1
to?	1
You	1
want	1
to	1
abolish	1
Government?"	1
"To	1
abolish	1
God!"	1
said	1
Gregory,	1
opening	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
a	1
fanatic.	1
"We	1
do	1
not	1
only	1
want	1
to	1
upset	1
a	1
few	1
despotisms	1
and	1
police	1
regulations;	1
that	1
sort	1
of	1
anarchism	1
does	1
exist,	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
mere	1
branch	1
of	1
the	1
Nonconformists.	1
We	1
dig	1
deeper	1
and	1
we	1
blow	1
you	1
higher.	1
We	1
wish	1
to	1
deny	1
all	1
those	1
arbitrary	1
distinctions	1
of	1
vice	1
and	1
virtue,	1
honour	1
and	1
treachery,	1
upon	1
which	1
mere	1
rebels	1
base	1
themselves.	1
The	1
silly	1
sentimentalists	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
Revolution	1
talked	1
of	1
the	1
Rights	1
of	1
Man!	1
We	1
hate	1
Rights	1
as	1
we	1
hate	1
Wrongs.	1
We	1
have	1
abolished	1
Right	1
and	1
Wrong."	1
"And	1
Right	1
and	1
Left,"	1
said	1
Syme	1
with	1
a	1
simple	1
eagerness,	1
"I	1
hope	1
you	1
will	1
abolish	1
them	1
too.	1
They	1
are	1
much	1
more	1
troublesome	1
to	1
me."	1
"You	1
spoke	1
of	1
a	1
second	1
question,"	1
snapped	1
Gregory.	1
"With	1
pleasure,"	1
resumed	1
Syme.	1
"In	1
all	1
your	1
present	1
acts	1
and	1
surroundings	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
scientific	1
attempt	1
at	1
secrecy.	1
I	1
have	1
an	1
aunt	1
who	1
lived	1
over	1
a	1
shop,	1
but	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
people	1
living	1
from	1
preference	1
under	1
a	1
public-house.	1
You	1
have	1
a	1
heavy	1
iron	1
door.	1
You	1
cannot	1
pass	1
it	1
without	1
submitting	1
to	1
the	1
humiliation	1
of	1
calling	1
yourself	1
Mr.	1
Chamberlain.	1
You	1
surround	1
yourself	1
with	1
steel	1
instruments	1
which	1
make	1
the	1
place,	1
if	1
I	1
may	1
say	1
so,	1
more	1
impressive	1
than	1
homelike.	1
May	1
I	1
ask	1
why,	1
after	1
taking	1
all	1
this	1
trouble	1
to	1
barricade	1
yourselves	1
in	1
the	1
bowels	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
you	1
then	1
parade	1
your	1
whole	1
secret	1
by	1
talking	1
about	1
anarchism	1
to	1
every	1
silly	1
woman	1
in	1
Saffron	1
Park?"	1
Gregory	1
smiled.	1
"The	1
answer	1
is	1
simple,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"I	1
told	1
you	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
serious	1
anarchist,	1
and	1
you	1
did	1
not	1
believe	1
me.	1
Nor	1
do	1
they	1
believe	1
me.	1
Unless	1
I	1
took	1
them	1
into	1
this	1
infernal	1
room	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
believe	1
me."	1
Syme	1
smoked	1
thoughtfully,	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
interest.	1
Gregory	1
went	1
on.	1
"The	1
history	1
of	1
the	1
thing	1
might	1
amuse	1
you,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"When	1
first	1
I	1
became	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
New	1
Anarchists	1
I	1
tried	1
all	1
kinds	1
of	1
respectable	1
disguises.	1
I	1
dressed	1
up	1
as	1
a	1
bishop.	1
I	1
read	1
up	1
all	1
about	1
bishops	1
in	1
our	1
anarchist	1
pamphlets,	1
in	1
Superstition	1
the	1
Vampire	1
and	1
Priests	1
of	1
Prey.	1
I	1
certainly	1
understood	1
from	1
them	1
that	1
bishops	1
are	1
strange	1
and	1
terrible	1
old	1
men	1
keeping	1
a	1
cruel	1
secret	1
from	1
mankind.	1
I	1
was	1
misinformed.	1
When	1
on	1
my	1
first	1
appearing	1
in	1
episcopal	1
gaiters	1
in	1
a	1
drawing-room	1
I	1
cried	1
out	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
of	1
thunder,	1
'Down!	1
down!	1
presumptuous	1
human	1
reason!'	1
they	1
found	1
out	1
in	1
some	1
way	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
bishop	1
at	1
all.	1
I	1
was	1
nabbed	1
at	1
once.	1
Then	1
I	1
made	1
up	1
as	1
a	1
millionaire;	1
but	1
I	1
defended	1
Capital	1
with	1
so	1
much	1
intelligence	1
that	1
a	1
fool	1
could	1
see	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
quite	1
poor.	1
Then	1
I	1
tried	1
being	1
a	1
major.	1
Now	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
humanitarian	1
myself,	1
but	1
I	1
have,	1
I	1
hope,	1
enough	1
intellectual	1
breadth	1
to	1
understand	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
those	1
who,	1
like	1
Nietzsche,	1
admire	1
violence--the	1
proud,	1
mad	1
war	1
of	1
Nature	1
and	1
all	1
that,	1
you	1
know.	1
I	1
threw	1
myself	1
into	1
the	1
major.	1
I	1
drew	1
my	1
sword	1
and	1
waved	1
it	1
constantly.	1
I	1
called	1
out	1
'Blood!'	1
abstractedly,	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
calling	1
for	1
wine.	1
I	1
often	1
said,	1
'Let	1
the	1
weak	1
perish;	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
Law.'	1
Well,	1
well,	1
it	1
seems	1
majors	1
don't	1
do	1
this.	1
I	1
was	1
nabbed	1
again.	1
At	1
last	1
I	1
went	1
in	1
despair	1
to	1
the	1
President	1
of	1
the	1
Central	1
Anarchist	1
Council,	1
who	1
is	1
the	1
greatest	1
man	1
in	1
Europe."	1
"What	1
is	1
his	1
name?"	1
asked	1
Syme.	1
"You	1
would	1
not	1
know	1
it,"	1
answered	1
Gregory.	1
"That	1
is	1
his	1
greatness.	1
Caesar	1
and	1
Napoleon	1
put	1
all	1
their	1
genius	1
into	1
being	1
heard	1
of,	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
heard	1
of.	1
He	1
puts	1
all	1
his	1
genius	1
into	1
not	1
being	1
heard	1
of,	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
heard	1
of.	1
But	1
you	1
cannot	1
be	1
for	1
five	1
minutes	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
with	1
him	1
without	1
feeling	1
that	1
Caesar	1
and	1
Napoleon	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
children	1
in	1
his	1
hands."	1
He	1
was	1
silent	1
and	1
even	1
pale	1
for	1
a	1
moment,	1
and	1
then	1
resumed--	1
"But	1
whenever	1
he	1
gives	1
advice	1
it	1
is	1
always	1
something	1
as	1
startling	1
as	1
an	1
epigram,	1
and	1
yet	1
as	1
practical	1
as	1
the	1
Bank	1
of	1
England.	1
I	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
'What	1
disguise	1
will	1
hide	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
world?	1
What	1
can	1
I	1
find	1
more	1
respectable	1
than	1
bishops	1
and	1
majors?'	1
He	1
looked	1
at	1
me	1
with	1
his	1
large	1
but	1
indecipherable	1
face.	1
'You	1
want	1
a	1
safe	1
disguise,	1
do	1
you?	1
You	1
want	1
a	1
dress	1
which	1
will	1
guarantee	1
you	1
harmless;	1
a	1
dress	1
in	1
which	1
no	1
one	1
would	1
ever	1
look	1
for	1
a	1
bomb?'	1
I	1
nodded.	1
He	1
suddenly	1
lifted	1
his	1
lion's	1
voice.	1
'Why,	1
then,	1
dress	1
up	1
as	1
an	1
anarchist,	1
you	1
fool!'	1
he	1
roared	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
room	1
shook.	1
'Nobody	1
will	1
ever	1
expect	1
you	1
to	1
do	1
anything	1
dangerous	1
then.'	1
And	1
he	1
turned	1
his	1
broad	1
back	1
on	1
me	1
without	1
another	1
word.	1
I	1
took	1
his	1
advice,	1
and	1
have	1
never	1
regretted	1
it.	1
I	1
preached	1
blood	1
and	1
murder	1
to	1
those	1
women	1
day	1
and	1
night,	1
and--by	1
God!--they	1
would	1
let	1
me	1
wheel	1
their	1
perambulators."	1
Syme	1
sat	1
watching	1
him	1
with	1
some	1
respect	1
in	1
his	1
large,	1
blue	1
eyes.	1
"You	1
took	1
me	1
in,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"It	1
is	1
really	1
a	1
smart	1
dodge."	1
Then	1
after	1
a	1
pause	1
he	1
added--	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
call	1
this	1
tremendous	1
President	1
of	1
yours?"	1
"We	1
generally	1
call	1
him	1
Sunday,"	1
replied	1
Gregory	1
with	1
simplicity.	1
'You	1
see,	1
there	1
are	1
seven	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
Central	1
Anarchist	1
Council,	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
named	1
after	1
days	1
of	1
the	1
week.	1
He	1
is	1
called	1
Sunday,	1
by	1
some	1
of	1
his	1
admirers	1
Bloody	1
Sunday.	1
It	1
is	1
curious	1
you	1
should	1
mention	1
the	1
matter,	1
because	1
the	1
very	1
night	1
you	1
have	1
dropped	1
in	1
(if	1
I	1
may	1
so	1
express	1
it)	1
is	1
the	1
night	1
on	1
which	1
our	1
London	1
branch,	1
which	1
assembles	1
in	1
this	1
room,	1
has	1
to	1
elect	1
its	1
own	1
deputy	1
to	1
fill	1
a	1
vacancy	1
in	1
the	1
Council.	1
The	1
gentleman	1
who	1
has	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
past	1
played,	1
with	1
propriety	1
and	1
general	1
applause,	1
the	1
difficult	1
part	1
of	1
Thursday,	1
has	1
died	1
quite	1
suddenly.	1
Consequently,	1
we	1
have	1
called	1
a	1
meeting	1
this	1
very	1
evening	1
to	1
elect	1
a	1
successor."	1
He	1
got	1
to	1
his	1
feet	1
and	1
strolled	1
across	1
the	1
room	1
with	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
smiling	1
embarrassment.	1
"I	1
feel	1
somehow	1
as	1
if	1
you	1
were	1
my	1
mother,	1
Syme,"	1
he	1
continued	1
casually.	1
"I	1
feel	1
that	1
I	1
can	1
confide	1
anything	1
to	1
you,	1
as	1
you	1
have	1
promised	1
to	1
tell	1
nobody.	1
In	1
fact,	1
I	1
will	1
confide	1
to	1
you	1
something	1
that	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
say	1
in	1
so	1
many	1
words	1
to	1
the	1
anarchists	1
who	1
will	1
be	1
coming	1
to	1
the	1
room	1
in	1
about	1
ten	1
minutes.	1
We	1
shall,	1
of	1
course,	1
go	1
through	1
a	1
form	1
of	1
election;	1
but	1
I	1
don't	1
mind	1
telling	1
you	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
practically	1
certain	1
what	1
the	1
result	1
will	1
be."	1
He	1
looked	1
down	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
modestly.	1
"It	1
is	1
almost	1
a	1
settled	1
thing	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
be	1
Thursday."	1
"My	1
dear	1
fellow."	1
said	1
Syme	1
heartily,	1
"I	1
congratulate	1
you.	1
A	1
great	1
career!"	1
Gregory	1
smiled	1
in	1
deprecation,	1
and	1
walked	1
across	1
the	1
room,	1
talking	1
rapidly.	1
"As	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
fact,	1
everything	1
is	1
ready	1
for	1
me	1
on	1
this	1
table,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"and	1
the	1
ceremony	1
will	1
probably	1
be	1
the	1
shortest	1
possible."	1
Syme	1
also	1
strolled	1
across	1
to	1
the	1
table,	1
and	1
found	1
lying	1
across	1
it	1
a	1
walking-stick,	1
which	1
turned	1
out	1
on	1
examination	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
sword-stick,	1
a	1
large	1
Colt's	1
revolver,	1
a	1
sandwich	1
case,	1
and	1
a	1
formidable	1
flask	1
of	1
brandy.	1
Over	1
the	1
chair,	1
beside	1
the	1
table,	1
was	1
thrown	1
a	1
heavy-looking	1
cape	1
or	1
cloak.	1
"I	1
have	1
only	1
to	1
get	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
election	1
finished,"	1
continued	1
Gregory	1
with	1
animation,	1
"then	1
I	1
snatch	1
up	1
this	1
cloak	1
and	1
stick,	1
stuff	1
these	1
other	1
things	1
into	1
my	1
pocket,	1
step	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
door	1
in	1
this	1
cavern,	1
which	1
opens	1
on	1
the	1
river,	1
where	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
steam-tug	1
already	1
waiting	1
for	1
me,	1
and	1
then--then--oh,	1
the	1
wild	1
joy	1
of	1
being	1
Thursday!"	1
And	1
he	1
clasped	1
his	1
hands.	1
Syme,	1
who	1
had	1
sat	1
down	1
once	1
more	1
with	1
his	1
usual	1
insolent	1
languor,	1
got	1
to	1
his	1
feet	1
with	1
an	1
unusual	1
air	1
of	1
hesitation.	1
"Why	1
is	1
it,"	1
he	1
asked	1
vaguely,	1
"that	1
I	1
think	1
you	1
are	1
quite	1
a	1
decent	1
fellow?	1
Why	1
do	1
I	1
positively	1
like	1
you,	1
Gregory?"	1
He	1
paused	1
a	1
moment,	1
and	1
then	1
added	1
with	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
fresh	1
curiosity,	1
"Is	1
it	1
because	1
you	1
are	1
such	1
an	1
ass?"	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
thoughtful	1
silence	1
again,	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
cried	1
out--	1
"Well,	1
damn	1
it	1
all!	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
funniest	1
situation	1
I	1
have	1
ever	1
been	1
in	1
in	1
my	1
life,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
going	1
to	1
act	1
accordingly.	1
Gregory,	1
I	1
gave	1
you	1
a	1
promise	1
before	1
I	1
came	1
into	1
this	1
place.	1
That	1
promise	1
I	1
would	1
keep	1
under	1
red-hot	1
pincers.	1
Would	1
you	1
give	1
me,	1
for	1
my	1
own	1
safety,	1
a	1
little	1
promise	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
kind?	1
"	1
"A	1
promise?"	1
asked	1
Gregory,	1
wondering.	1
"Yes,"	1
said	1
Syme	1
very	1
seriously,	1
"a	1
promise.	1
I	1
swore	1
before	1
God	1
that	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
tell	1
your	1
secret	1
to	1
the	1
police.	1
Will	1
you	1
swear	1
by	1
Humanity,	1
or	1
whatever	1
beastly	1
thing	1
you	1
believe	1
in,	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
tell	1
my	1
secret	1
to	1
the	1
anarchists?"	1
"Your	1
secret?"	1
asked	1
the	1
staring	1
Gregory.	1
"Have	1
you	1
got	1
a	1
secret?"	1
"Yes,"	1
said	1
Syme,	1
"I	1
have	1
a	1
secret."	1
Then	1
after	1
a	1
pause,	1
"Will	1
you	1
swear?"	1
Gregory	1
glared	1
at	1
him	1
gravely	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
moments,	1
and	1
then	1
said	1
abruptly--	1
"You	1
must	1
have	1
bewitched	1
me,	1
but	1
I	1
feel	1
a	1
furious	1
curiosity	1
about	1
you.	1
Yes,	1
I	1
will	1
swear	1
not	1
to	1
tell	1
the	1
anarchists	1
anything	1
you	1
tell	1
me.	1
But	1
look	1
sharp,	1
for	1
they	1
will	1
be	1
here	1
in	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
minutes."	1
Syme	1
rose	1
slowly	1
to	1
his	1
feet	1
and	1
thrust	1
his	1
long,	1
white	1
hands	1
into	1
his	1
long,	1
grey	1
trousers'	1
pockets.	1
Almost	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
so	1
there	1
came	1
five	1
knocks	1
on	1
the	1
outer	1
grating,	1
proclaiming	1
the	1
arrival	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
of	1
the	1
conspirators.	1
"Well,"	1
said	1
Syme	1
slowly,	1
"I	1
don't	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
the	1
truth	1
more	1
shortly	1
than	1
by	1
saying	1
that	1
your	1
expedient	1
of	1
dressing	1
up	1
as	1
an	1
aimless	1
poet	1
is	1
not	1
confined	1
to	1
you	1
or	1
your	1
President.	1
We	1
have	1
known	1
the	1
dodge	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
at	1
Scotland	1
Yard."	1
Gregory	1
tried	1
to	1
spring	1
up	1
straight,	1
but	1
he	1
swayed	1
thrice.	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
say?"	1
he	1
asked	1
in	1
an	1
inhuman	1
voice.	1
"Yes,"	1
said	1
Syme	1
simply,	1
"I	1
am	1
a	1
police	1
detective.	1
But	1
I	1
think	1
I	1
hear	1
your	1
friends	1
coming."	1
From	1
the	1
doorway	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
murmur	1
of	1
"Mr.	1
Joseph	1
Chamberlain."	1
It	1
was	1
repeated	1
twice	1
and	1
thrice,	1
and	1
then	1
thirty	1
times,	1
and	1
the	1
crowd	1
of	1
Joseph	1
Chamberlains	1
(a	1
solemn	1
thought)	1
could	1
be	1
heard	1
trampling	1
down	1
the	1
corridor.	1
CHAPTER	1
III	1
THE	1
MAN	1
WHO	1
WAS	1
THURSDAY	1
BEFORE	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
fresh	1
faces	1
could	1
appear	1
at	1
the	1
doorway,	1
Gregory's	1
stunned	1
surprise	1
had	1
fallen	1
from	1
him.	1
He	1
was	1
beside	1
the	1
table	1
with	1
a	1
bound,	1
and	1
a	1
noise	1
in	1
his	1
throat	1
like	1
a	1
wild	1
beast.	1
He	1
caught	1
up	1
the	1
Colt's	1
revolver	1
and	1
took	1
aim	1
at	1
Syme.	1
Syme	1
did	1
not	1
flinch,	1
but	1
he	1
put	1
up	1
a	1
pale	1
and	1
polite	1
hand.	1
"Don't	1
be	1
such	1
a	1
silly	1
man,"	1
he	1
said,	1
with	1
the	1
effeminate	1
dignity	1
of	1
a	1
curate.	1
"Don't	1
you	1
see	1
it's	1
not	1
necessary?	1
Don't	1
you	1
see	1
that	1
we're	1
both	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
boat?	1
Yes,	1
and	1
jolly	1
sea-sick."	1
Gregory	1
could	1
not	1
speak,	1
but	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
fire	1
either,	1
and	1
he	1
looked	1
his	1
question.	1
"Don't	1
you	1
see	1
we've	1
checkmated	1
each	1
other?"	1
cried	1
Syme.	1
"I	1
can't	1
tell	1
the	1
police	1
you	1
are	1
an	1
anarchist.	1
You	1
can't	1
tell	1
the	1
anarchists	1
I'm	1
a	1
policeman.	1
I	1
can	1
only	1
watch	1
you,	1
knowing	1
what	1
you	1
are;	1
you	1
can	1
only	1
watch	1
me,	1
knowing	1
what	1
I	1
am.	1
In	1
short,	1
it's	1
a	1
lonely,	1
intellectual	1
duel,	1
my	1
head	1
against	1
yours.	1
I'm	1
a	1
policeman	1
deprived	1
of	1
the	1
help	1
of	1
the	1
police.	1
You,	1
my	1
poor	1
fellow,	1
are	1
an	1
anarchist	1
deprived	1
of	1
the	1
help	1
of	1
that	1
law	1
and	1
organisation	1
which	1
is	1
so	1
essential	1
to	1
anarchy.	1
The	1
one	1
solitary	1
difference	1
is	1
in	1
your	1
favour.	1
You	1
are	1
not	1
surrounded	1
by	1
inquisitive	1
policemen;	1
I	1
am	1
surrounded	1
by	1
inquisitive	1
anarchists.	1
I	1
cannot	1
betray	1
you,	1
but	1
I	1
might	1
betray	1
myself.	1
Come,	1
come!	1
wait	1
and	1
see	1
me	1
betray	1
myself.	1
I	1
shall	1
do	1
it	1
so	1
nicely."	1
Gregory	1
put	1
the	1
pistol	1
slowly	1
down,	1
still	1
staring	1
at	1
Syme	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
a	1
sea-monster.	1
"I	1
don't	1
believe	1
in	1
immortality,"	1
he	1
said	1
at	1
last,	1
"but	1
if,	1
after	1
all	1
this,	1
you	1
were	1
to	1
break	1
your	1
word,	1
God	1
would	1
make	1
a	1
hell	1
only	1
for	1
you,	1
to	1
howl	1
in	1
for	1
ever."	1
"I	1
shall	1
not	1
break	1
my	1
word,"	1
said	1
Syme	1
sternly,	1
"nor	1
will	1
you	1
break	1
yours.	1
Here	1
are	1
your	1
friends."	1
The	1
mass	1
of	1
the	1
anarchists	1
entered	1
the	1
room	1
heavily,	1
with	1
a	1
slouching	1
and	1
somewhat	1
weary	1
gait;	1
but	1
one	1
little	1
man,	1
with	1
a	1
black	1
beard	1
and	1
glasses--a	1
man	1
somewhat	1
of	1
the	1
type	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Tim	1
Healy--detached	1
himself,	1
and	1
bustled	1
forward	1
with	1
some	1
papers	1
in	1
his	1
hand.	1
"Comrade	1
Gregory,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"I	1
suppose	1
this	1
man	1
is	1
a	1
delegate?"	1
Gregory,	1
taken	1
by	1
surprise,	1
looked	1
down	1
and	1
muttered	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Syme;	1
but	1
Syme	1
replied	1
almost	1
pertly--	1
"I	1
am	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
your	1
gate	1
is	1
well	1
enough	1
guarded	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
hard	1
for	1
anyone	1
to	1
be	1
here	1
who	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
delegate."	1
The	1
brow	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
man	1
with	1
the	1
black	1
beard	1
was,	1
however,	1
still	1
contracted	1
with	1
something	1
like	1
suspicion.	1
"What	1
branch	1
do	1
you	1
represent?"	1
he	1
asked	1
sharply.	1
"I	1
should	1
hardly	1
call	1
it	1
a	1
branch,"	1
said	1
Syme,	1
laughing;	1
"I	1
should	1
call	1
it	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
least	1
a	1
root."	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
mean?"	1
"The	1
fact	1
is,"	1
said	1
Syme	1
serenely,	1
"the	1
truth	1
is	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
Sabbatarian.	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
specially	1
sent	1
here	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
you	1
show	1
a	1
due	1
observance	1
of	1
Sunday."	1
The	1
little	1
man	1
dropped	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
papers,	1
and	1
a	1
flicker	1
of	1
fear	1
went	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
faces	1
of	1
the	1
group.	1
Evidently	1
the	1
awful	1
President,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Sunday,	1
did	1
sometimes	1
send	1
down	1
such	1
irregular	1
ambassadors	1
to	1
such	1
branch	1
meetings.	1
"Well,	1
comrade,"	1
said	1
the	1
man	1
with	1
the	1
papers	1
after	1
a	1
pause,	1
"I	1
suppose	1
we'd	1
better	1
give	1
you	1
a	1
seat	1
in	1
the	1
meeting?"	1
"If	1
you	1
ask	1
my	1
advice	1
as	1
a	1
friend,"	1
said	1
Syme	1
with	1
severe	1
benevolence,	1
"I	1
think	1
you'd	1
better."	1
When	1
Gregory	1
heard	1
the	1
dangerous	1
dialogue	1
end,	1
with	1
a	1
sudden	1
safety	1
for	1
his	1
rival,	1
he	1
rose	1
abruptly	1
and	1
paced	1
the	1
floor	1
in	1
painful	1
thought.	1
He	1
was,	1
indeed,	1
in	1
an	1
agony	1
of	1
diplomacy.	1
It	1
was	1
clear	1
that	1
Syme's	1
inspired	1
impudence	1
was	1
likely	1
to	1
bring	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
merely	1
accidental	1
dilemmas.	1
Little	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
hoped	1
from	1
them.	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
himself	1
betray	1
Syme,	1
partly	1
from	1
honour,	1
but	1
partly	1
also	1
because,	1
if	1
he	1
betrayed	1
him	1
and	1
for	1
some	1
reason	1
failed	1
to	1
destroy	1
him,	1
the	1
Syme	1
who	1
escaped	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
Syme	1
freed	1
from	1
all	1
obligation	1
of	1
secrecy,	1
a	1
Syme	1
who	1
would	1
simply	1
walk	1
to	1
the	1
nearest	1
police	1
station.	1
After	1
all,	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
one	1
night's	1
discussion,	1
and	1
only	1
one	1
detective	1
who	1
would	1
know	1
of	1
it.	1
He	1
would	1
let	1
out	1
as	1
little	1
as	1
possible	1
of	1
their	1
plans	1
that	1
night,	1
and	1
then	1
let	1
Syme	1
go,	1
and	1
chance	1
it.	1
He	1
strode	1
across	1
to	1
the	1
group	1
of	1
anarchists,	1
which	1
was	1
already	1
distributing	1
itself	1
along	1
the	1
benches.	1
"I	1
think	1
it	1
is	1
time	1
we	1
began,"	1
he	1
said;	1
"the	1
steam-tug	1
is	1
waiting	1
on	1
the	1
river	1
already.	1
I	1
move	1
that	1
Comrade	1
Buttons	1
takes	1
the	1
chair."	1
This	1
being	1
approved	1
by	1
a	1
show	1
of	1
hands,	1
the	1
little	1
man	1
with	1
the	1
papers	1
slipped	1
into	1
the	1
presidential	1
seat.	1
"Comrades,"	1
he	1
began,	1
as	1
sharp	1
as	1
a	1
pistol-shot,	1
"our	1
meeting	1
tonight	1
is	1
important,	1
though	1
it	1
need	1
not	1
be	1
long.	1
This	1
branch	1
has	1
always	1
had	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
electing	1
Thursdays	1
for	1
the	1
Central	1
European	1
Council.	1
We	1
have	1
elected	1
many	1
and	1
splendid	1
Thursdays.	1
We	1
all	1
lament	1
the	1
sad	1
decease	1
of	1
the	1
heroic	1
worker	1
who	1
occupied	1
the	1
post	1
until	1
last	1
week.	1
As	1
you	1
know,	1
his	1
services	1
to	1
the	1
cause	1
were	1
considerable.	1
He	1
organised	1
the	1
great	1
dynamite	1
coup	1
of	1
Brighton	1
which,	1
under	1
happier	1
circumstances,	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
killed	1
everybody	1
on	1
the	1
pier.	1
As	1
you	1
also	1
know,	1
his	1
death	1
was	1
as	1
self-denying	1
as	1
his	1
life,	1
for	1
he	1
died	1
through	1
his	1
faith	1
in	1
a	1
hygienic	1
mixture	1
of	1
chalk	1
and	1
water	1
as	1
a	1
substitute	1
for	1
milk,	1
which	1
beverage	1
he	1
regarded	1
as	1
barbaric,	1
and	1
as	1
involving	1
cruelty	1
to	1
the	1
cow.	1
Cruelty,	1
or	1
anything	1
approaching	1
to	1
cruelty,	1
revolted	1
him	1
always.	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
acclaim	1
his	1
virtues	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
met,	1
but	1
for	1
a	1
harder	1
task.	1
It	1
is	1
difficult	1
properly	1
to	1
praise	1
his	1
qualities,	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
more	1
difficult	1
to	1
replace	1
them.	1
Upon	1
you,	1
comrades,	1
it	1
devolves	1
this	1
evening	1
to	1
choose	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
company	1
present	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
shall	1
be	1
Thursday.	1
If	1
any	1
comrade	1
suggests	1
a	1
name	1
I	1
will	1
put	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
vote.	1
If	1
no	1
comrade	1
suggests	1
a	1
name,	1
I	1
can	1
only	1
tell	1
myself	1
that	1
that	1
dear	1
dynamiter,	1
who	1
is	1
gone	1
from	1
us,	1
has	1
carried	1
into	1
the	1
unknowable	1
abysses	1
the	1
last	1
secret	1
of	1
his	1
virtue	1
and	1
his	1
innocence."	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
stir	1
of	1
almost	1
inaudible	1
applause,	1
such	1
as	1
is	1
sometimes	1
heard	1
in	1
church.	1
Then	1
a	1
large	1
old	1
man,	1
with	1
a	1
long	1
and	1
venerable	1
white	1
beard,	1
perhaps	1
the	1
only	1
real	1
working-man	1
present,	1
rose	1
lumberingly	1
and	1
said--	1
"I	1
move	1
that	1
Comrade	1
Gregory	1
be	1
elected	1
Thursday,"	1
and	1
sat	1
lumberingly	1
down	1
again.	1
"Does	1
anyone	1
second?"	1
asked	1
the	1
chairman.	1
A	1
little	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
velvet	1
coat	1
and	1
pointed	1
beard	1
seconded.	1
"Before	1
I	1
put	1
the	1
matter	1
to	1
the	1
vote,"	1
said	1
the	1
chairman,	1
"I	1
will	1
call	1
on	1
Comrade	1
Gregory	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
statement."	1
Gregory	1
rose	1
amid	1
a	1
great	1
rumble	1
of	1
applause.	1
His	1
face	1
was	1
deadly	1
pale,	1
so	1
that	1
by	1
contrast	1
his	1
queer	1
red	1
hair	1
looked	1
almost	1
scarlet.	1
But	1
he	1
was	1
smiling	1
and	1
altogether	1
at	1
ease.	1
He	1
had	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind,	1
and	1
he	1
saw	1
his	1
best	1
policy	1
quite	1
plain	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
him	1
like	1
a	1
white	1
road.	1
His	1
best	1
chance	1
was	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
softened	1
and	1
ambiguous	1
speech,	1
such	1
as	1
would	1
leave	1
on	1
the	1
detective's	1
mind	1
the	1
impression	1
that	1
the	1
anarchist	1
brotherhood	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
mild	1
affair	1
after	1
all.	1
He	1
believed	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
literary	1
power,	1
his	1
capacity	1
for	1
suggesting	1
fine	1
shades	1
and	1
picking	1
perfect	1
words.	1
He	1
thought	1
that	1
with	1
care	1
he	1
could	1
succeed,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
around	1
him,	1
in	1
conveying	1
an	1
impression	1
of	1
the	1
institution,	1
subtly	1
and	1
delicately	1
false.	1
Syme	1
had	1
once	1
thought	1
that	1
anarchists,	1
under	1
all	1
their	1
bravado,	1
were	1
only	1
playing	1
the	1
fool.	1
Could	1
he	1
not	1
now,	1
in	1
the	1
hour	1
of	1
peril,	1
make	1
Syme	1
think	1
so	1
again?	1
"Comrades,"	1
began	1
Gregory,	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
but	1
penetrating	1
voice,	1
"it	1
is	1
not	1
necessary	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
what	1
is	1
my	1
policy,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
your	1
policy	1
also.	1
Our	1
belief	1
has	1
been	1
slandered,	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
disfigured,	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
utterly	1
confused	1
and	1
concealed,	1
but	1
it	1
has	1
never	1
been	1
altered.	1
Those	1
who	1
talk	1
about	1
anarchism	1
and	1
its	1
dangers	1
go	1
everywhere	1
and	1
anywhere	1
to	1
get	1
their	1
information,	1
except	1
to	1
us,	1
except	1
to	1
the	1
fountain	1
head.	1
They	1
learn	1
about	1
anarchists	1
from	1
sixpenny	1
novels;	1
they	1
learn	1
about	1
anarchists	1
from	1
tradesmen's	1
newspapers;	1
they	1
learn	1
about	1
anarchists	1
from	1
Ally	1
Sloper's	1
Half-Holiday	1
and	1
the	1
Sporting	1
Times.	1
They	1
never	1
learn	1
about	1
anarchists	1
from	1
anarchists.	1
We	1
have	1
no	1
chance	1
of	1
denying	1
the	1
mountainous	1
slanders	1
which	1
are	1
heaped	1
upon	1
our	1
heads	1
from	1
one	1
end	1
of	1
Europe	1
to	1
another.	1
The	1
man	1
who	1
has	1
always	1
heard	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
walking	1
plagues	1
has	1
never	1
heard	1
our	1
reply.	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
hear	1
it	1
tonight,	1
though	1
my	1
passion	1
were	1
to	1
rend	1
the	1
roof.	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
deep,	1
deep	1
under	1
the	1
earth	1
that	1
the	1
persecuted	1
are	1
permitted	1
to	1
assemble,	1
as	1
the	1
Christians	1
assembled	1
in	1
the	1
Catacombs.	1
But	1
if,	1
by	1
some	1
incredible	1
accident,	1
there	1
were	1
here	1
tonight	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
all	1
his	1
life	1
had	1
thus	1
immensely	1
misunderstood	1
us,	1
I	1
would	1
put	1
this	1
question	1
to	1
him:	1
'When	1
those	1
Christians	1
met	1
in	1
those	1
Catacombs,	1
what	1
sort	1
of	1
moral	1
reputation	1
had	1
they	1
in	1
the	1
streets	1
above?	1
What	1
tales	1
were	1
told	1
of	1
their	1
atrocities	1
by	1
one	1
educated	1
Roman	1
to	1
another?	1
Suppose'	1
(I	1
would	1
say	1
to	1
him),	1
'suppose	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
only	1
repeating	1
that	1
still	1
mysterious	1
paradox	1
of	1
history.	1
Suppose	1
we	1
seem	1
as	1
shocking	1
as	1
the	1
Christians	1
because	1
we	1
are	1
really	1
as	1
harmless	1
as	1
the	1
Christians.	1
Suppose	1
we	1
seem	1
as	1
mad	1
as	1
the	1
Christians	1
because	1
we	1
are	1
really	1
as	1
meek."'	1
The	1
applause	1
that	1
had	1
greeted	1
the	1
opening	1
sentences	1
had	1
been	1
gradually	1
growing	1
fainter,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
word	1
it	1
stopped	1
suddenly.	1
In	1
the	1
abrupt	1
silence,	1
the	1
man	1
with	1
the	1
velvet	1
jacket	1
said,	1
in	1
a	1
high,	1
squeaky	1
voice--	1
"I'm	1
not	1
meek!"	1
"Comrade	1
Witherspoon	1
tells	1
us,"	1
resumed	1
Gregory,	1
"that	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
meek.	1
Ah,	1
how	1
little	1
he	1
knows	1
himself!	1
His	1
words	1
are,	1
indeed,	1
extravagant;	1
his	1
appearance	1
is	1
ferocious,	1
and	1
even	1
(to	1
an	1
ordinary	1
taste)	1
unattractive.	1
But	1
only	1
the	1
eye	1
of	1
a	1
friendship	1
as	1
deep	1
and	1
delicate	1
as	1
mine	1
can	1
perceive	1
the	1
deep	1
foundation	1
of	1
solid	1
meekness	1
which	1
lies	1
at	1
the	1
base	1
of	1
him,	1
too	1
deep	1
even	1
for	1
himself	1
to	1
see.	1
I	1
repeat,	1
we	1
are	1
the	1
true	1
early	1
Christians,	1
only	1
that	1
we	1
come	1
too	1
late.	1
We	1
are	1
simple,	1
as	1
they	1
revere	1
simple--look	1
at	1
Comrade	1
Witherspoon.	1
We	1
are	1
modest,	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
modest--look	1
at	1
me.	1
We	1
are	1
merciful--"	1
"No,	1
no!"	1
called	1
out	1
Mr.	1
Witherspoon	1
with	1
the	1
velvet	1
jacket.	1
"I	1
say	1
we	1
are	1
merciful,"	1
repeated	1
Gregory	1
furiously,	1
"as	1
the	1
early	1
Christians	1
were	1
merciful.	1
Yet	1
this	1
did	1
not	1
prevent	1
their	1
being	1
accused	1
of	1
eating	1
human	1
flesh.	1
We	1
do	1
not	1
eat	1
human	1
flesh--"	1
"Shame!"	1
cried	1
Witherspoon.	1
"Why	1
not?"	1
"Comrade	1
Witherspoon,"	1
said	1
Gregory,	1
with	1
a	1
feverish	1
gaiety,	1
"is	1
anxious	1
to	1
know	1
why	1
nobody	1
eats	1
him	1
(laughter).	1
In	1
our	1
society,	1
at	1
any	1
rate,	1
which	1
loves	1
him	1
sincerely,	1
which	1
is	1
founded	1
upon	1
love--"	1
"No,	1
no!"	1
said	1
Witherspoon,	1
"down	1
with	1
love."	1
"Which	1
is	1
founded	1
upon	1
love,"	1
repeated	1
Gregory,	1
grinding	1
his	1
teeth,	1
"there	1
will	1
be	1
no	1
difficulty	1
about	1
the	1
aims	1
which	1
we	1
shall	1
pursue	1
as	1
a	1
body,	1
or	1
which	1
I	1
should	1
pursue	1
were	1
I	1
chosen	1
as	1
the	1
representative	1
of	1
that	1
body.	1
Superbly	1
careless	1
of	1
the	1
slanders	1
that	1
represent	1
us	1
as	1
assassins	1
and	1
enemies	1
of	1
human	1
society,	1
we	1
shall	1
pursue	1
with	1
moral	1
courage	1
and	1
quiet	1
intellectual	1
pressure,	1
the	1
permanent	1
ideals	1
of	1
brotherhood	1
and	1
simplicity."	1
Gregory	1
resumed	1
his	1
seat	1
and	1
passed	1
his	1
hand	1
across	1
his	1
forehead.	1
The	1
silence	1
was	1
sudden	1
and	1
awkward,	1
but	1
the	1
chairman	1
rose	1
like	1
an	1
automaton,	1
and	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
colourless	1
voice--	1
"Does	1
anyone	1
oppose	1
the	1
election	1
of	1
Comrade	1
Gregory?"	1
The	1
assembly	1
seemed	1
vague	1
and	1
sub-consciously	1
disappointed,	1
and	1
Comrade	1
Witherspoon	1
moved	1
restlessly	1
on	1
his	1
seat	1
and	1
muttered	1
in	1
his	1
thick	1
beard.	1
By	1
the	1
sheer	1
rush	1
of	1
routine,	1
however,	1
the	1
motion	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
put	1
and	1
carried.	1
But	1
as	1
the	1
chairman	1
was	1
opening	1
his	1
mouth	1
to	1
put	1
it,	1
Syme	1
sprang	1
to	1
his	1
feet	1
and	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
small	1
and	1
quiet	1
voice--	1
"Yes,	1
Mr.	1
Chairman,	1
I	1
oppose."	1
The	1
most	1
effective	1
fact	1
in	1
oratory	1
is	1
an	1
unexpected	1
change	1
in	1
the	1
voice.	1
Mr.	1
Gabriel	1
Syme	1
evidently	1
understood	1
oratory.	1
Having	1
said	1
these	1
first	1
formal	1
words	1
in	1
a	1
moderated	1
tone	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
brief	1
simplicity,	1
he	1
made	1
his	1
next	1
word	1
ring	1
and	1
volley	1
in	1
the	1
vault	1
as	1
if	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
guns	1
had	1
gone	1
off.	1
"Comrades!"	1
he	1
cried,	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
that	1
made	1
every	1
man	1
jump	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
boots,	1
"have	1
we	1
come	1
here	1
for	1
this?	1
Do	1
we	1
live	1
underground	1
like	1
rats	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
talk	1
like	1
this?	1
This	1
is	1
talk	1
we	1
might	1
listen	1
to	1
while	1
eating	1
buns	1
at	1
a	1
Sunday	1
School	1
treat.	1
Do	1
we	1
line	1
these	1
walls	1
with	1
weapons	1
and	1
bar	1
that	1
door	1
with	1
death	1
lest	1
anyone	1
should	1
come	1
and	1
hear	1
Comrade	1
Gregory	1
saying	1
to	1
us,	1
'Be	1
good,	1
and	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
happy,'	1
'Honesty	1
is	1
the	1
best	1
policy,'	1
and	1
'Virtue	1
is	1
its	1
own	1
reward'?	1
There	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
word	1
in	1
Comrade	1
Gregory's	1
address	1
to	1
which	1
a	1
curate	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
listened	1
with	1
pleasure	1
(hear,	1
hear).	1
But	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
a	1
curate	1
(loud	1
cheers),	1
and	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
listen	1
to	1
it	1
with	1
pleasure	1
(renewed	1
cheers).	1
The	1
man	1
who	1
is	1
fitted	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
good	1
curate	1
is	1
not	1
fitted	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
resolute,	1
forcible,	1
and	1
efficient	1
Thursday	1
(hear,	1
hear)."	1
"Comrade	1
Gregory	1
has	1
told	1
us,	1
in	1
only	1
too	1
apologetic	1
a	1
tone,	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
the	1
enemies	1
of	1
society.	1
But	1
I	1
say	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
the	1
enemies	1
of	1
society,	1
and	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
worse	1
for	1
society.	1
We	1
are	1
the	1
enemies	1
of	1
society,	1
for	1
society	1
is	1
the	1
enemy	1
of	1
humanity,	1
its	1
oldest	1
and	1
its	1
most	1
pitiless	1
enemy	1
(hear,	1
hear).	1
Comrade	1
Gregory	1
has	1
told	1
us	1
(apologetically	1
again)	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
murderers.	1
There	1
I	1
agree.	1
We	1
are	1
not	1
murderers,	1
we	1
are	1
executioners	1
(cheers)."	1
Ever	1
since	1
Syme	1
had	1
risen	1
Gregory	1
had	1
sat	1
staring	1
at	1
him,	1
his	1
face	1
idiotic	1
with	1
astonishment.	1
Now	1
in	1
the	1
pause	1
his	1
lips	1
of	1
clay	1
parted,	1
and	1
he	1
said,	1
with	1
an	1
automatic	1
and	1
lifeless	1
distinctness--	1
"You	1
damnable	1
hypocrite!"	1
Syme	1
looked	1
straight	1
into	1
those	1
frightful	1
eyes	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
pale	1
blue	1
ones,	1
and	1
said	1
with	1
dignity--	1
"Comrade	1
Gregory	1
accuses	1
me	1
of	1
hypocrisy.	1
He	1
knows	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
I	1
do	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
keeping	1
all	1
my	1
engagements	1
and	1
doing	1
nothing	1
but	1
my	1
duty.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
mince	1
words.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
pretend	1
to.	1
I	1
say	1
that	1
Comrade	1
Gregory	1
is	1
unfit	1
to	1
be	1
Thursday	1
for	1
all	1
his	1
amiable	1
qualities.	1
He	1
is	1
unfit	1
to	1
be	1
Thursday	1
because	1
of	1
his	1
amiable	1
qualities.	1
We	1
do	1
not	1
want	1
the	1
Supreme	1
Council	1
of	1
Anarchy	1
infected	1
with	1
a	1
maudlin	1
mercy	1
(hear,	1
hear).	1
This	1
is	1
no	1
time	1
for	1
ceremonial	1
politeness,	1
neither	1
is	1
it	1
a	1
time	1
for	1
ceremonial	1
modesty.	1
I	1
set	1
myself	1
against	1
Comrade	1
Gregory	1
as	1
I	1
would	1
set	1
myself	1
against	1
all	1
the	1
Governments	1
of	1
Europe,	1
because	1
the	1
anarchist	1
who	1
has	1
given	1
himself	1
to	1
anarchy	1
has	1
forgotten	1
modesty	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
he	1
has	1
forgotten	1
pride	1
(cheers).	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
a	1
man	1
at	1
all.	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
cause	1
(renewed	1
cheers).	1
I	1
set	1
myself	1
against	1
Comrade	1
Gregory	1
as	1
impersonally	1
and	1
as	1
calmly	1
as	1
I	1
should	1
choose	1
one	1
pistol	1
rather	1
than	1
another	1
out	1
of	1
that	1
rack	1
upon	1
the	1
wall;	1
and	1
I	1
say	1
that	1
rather	1
than	1
have	1
Gregory	1
and	1
his	1
milk-and-water	1
methods	1
on	1
the	1
Supreme	1
Council,	1
I	1
would	1
offer	1
myself	1
for	1
election--"	1
His	1
sentence	1
was	1
drowned	1
in	1
a	1
deafening	1
cataract	1
of	1
applause.	1
The	1
faces,	1
that	1
had	1
grown	1
fiercer	1
and	1
fiercer	1
with	1
approval	1
as	1
his	1
tirade	1
grew	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
uncompromising,	1
were	1
now	1
distorted	1
with	1
grins	1
of	1
anticipation	1
or	1
cloven	1
with	1
delighted	1
cries.	1
At	1
the	1
moment	1
when	1
he	1
announced	1
himself	1
as	1
ready	1
to	1
stand	1
for	1
the	1
post	1
of	1
Thursday,	1
a	1
roar	1
of	1
excitement	1
and	1
assent	1
broke	1
forth,	1
and	1
became	1
uncontrollable,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
moment	1
Gregory	1
sprang	1
to	1
his	1
feet,	1
with	1
foam	1
upon	1
his	1
mouth,	1
and	1
shouted	1
against	1
the	1
shouting.	1
"Stop,	1
you	1
blasted	1
madmen!"	1
he	1
cried,	1
at	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
a	1
voice	1
that	1
tore	1
his	1
throat.	1
"Stop,	1
you--"	1
But	1
louder	1
than	1
Gregory's	1
shouting	1
and	1
louder	1
than	1
the	1
roar	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
came	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
Syme,	1
still	1
speaking	1
in	1
a	1
peal	1
of	1
pitiless	1
thunder--	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
Council	1
to	1
rebut	1
that	1
slander	1
that	1
calls	1
us	1
murderers;	1
I	1
go	1
to	1
earn	1
it	1
(loud	1
and	1
prolonged	1
cheering).	1
To	1
the	1
priest	1
who	1
says	1
these	1
men	1
are	1
the	1
enemies	1
of	1
religion,	1
to	1
the	1
judge	1
who	1
says	1
these	1
men	1
are	1
the	1
enemies	1
of	1
law,	1
to	1
the	1
fat	1
parliamentarian	1
who	1
says	1
these	1
men	1
are	1
the	1
enemies	1
of	1
order	1
and	1
public	1
decency,	1
to	1
all	1
these	1
I	1
will	1
reply,	1
'You	1
are	1
false	1
kings,	1
but	1
you	1
are	1
true	1
prophets.	1
I	1
am	1
come	1
to	1
destroy	1
you,	1
and	1
to	1
fulfil	1
your	1
prophecies.'"	1
The	1
heavy	1
clamour	1
gradually	1
died	1
away,	1
but	1
before	1
it	1
had	1
ceased	1
Witherspoon	1
had	1
jumped	1
to	1
his	1
feet,	1
his	1
hair	1
and	1
beard	1
all	1
on	1
end,	1
and	1
had	1
said--	1
"I	1
move,	1
as	1
an	1
amendment,	1
that	1
Comrade	1
Syme	1
be	1
appointed	1
to	1
the	1
post."	1
"Stop	1
all	1
this,	1
I	1
tell	1
you!"	1
cried	1
Gregory,	1
with	1
frantic	1
face	1
and	1
hands.	1
"Stop	1
it,	1
it	1
is	1
all--"	1
The	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
chairman	1
clove	1
his	1
speech	1
with	1
a	1
cold	1
accent.	1
"Does	1
anyone	1
second	1
this	1
amendment?"	1
he	1
said.	1
A	1
tall,	1
tired	1
man,	1
with	1
melancholy	1
eyes	1
and	1
an	1
American	1
chin	1
beard,	1
was	1
observed	1
on	1
the	1
back	1
bench	1
to	1
be	1
slowly	1
rising	1
to	1
his	1
feet.	1
Gregory	1
had	1
been	1
screaming	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
past;	1
now	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
change	1
in	1
his	1
accent,	1
more	1
shocking	1
than	1
any	1
scream.	1
"I	1
end	1
all	1
this!"	1
he	1
said,	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
as	1
heavy	1
as	1
stone.	1
"This	1
man	1
cannot	1
be	1
elected.	1
He	1
is	1
a--"	1
"Yes,"	1
said	1
Syme,	1
quite	1
motionless,	1
"what	1
is	1
he?"	1
Gregory's	1
mouth	1
worked	1
twice	1
without	1
sound;	1
then	1
slowly	1
the	1
blood	1
began	1
to	1
crawl	1
back	1
into	1
his	1
dead	1
face.	1
"He	1
is	1
a	1
man	1
quite	1
inexperienced	1
in	1
our	1
work,"	1
he	1
said,	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
abruptly.	1
Before	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
so,	1
the	1
long,	1
lean	1
man	1
with	1
the	1
American	1
beard	1
was	1
again	1
upon	1
his	1
feet,	1
and	1
was	1
repeating	1
in	1
a	1
high	1
American	1
monotone--	1
"I	1
beg	1
to	1
second	1
the	1
election	1
of	1
Comrade	1
Syme."	1
"The	1
amendment	1
will,	1
as	1
usual,	1
be	1
put	1
first,"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Buttons,	1
the	1
chairman,	1
with	1
mechanical	1
rapidity.	1
"The	1
question	1
is	1
that	1
Comrade	1
Syme--"	1
Gregory	1
had	1
again	1
sprung	1
to	1
his	1
feet,	1
panting	1
and	1
passionate.	1
"Comrades,"	1
he	1
cried	1
out,	1
"I	1
am	1
not	1
a	1
madman."	1
"Oh,	1
oh!"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Witherspoon.	1
"I	1
am	1
not	1
a	1
madman,"	1
reiterated	1
Gregory,	1
with	1
a	1
frightful	1
sincerity	1
which	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
staggered	1
the	1
room,	1
"but	1
I	1
give	1
you	1
a	1
counsel	1
which	1
you	1
can	1
call	1
mad	1
if	1
you	1
like.	1
No,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
call	1
it	1
a	1
counsel,	1
for	1
I	1
can	1
give	1
you	1
no	1
reason	1
for	1
it.	1
I	1
will	1
call	1
it	1
a	1
command.	1
Call	1
it	1
a	1
mad	1
command,	1
but	1
act	1
upon	1
it.	1
Strike,	1
but	1
hear	1
me!	1
Kill	1
me,	1
but	1
obey	1
me!	1
Do	1
not	1
elect	1
this	1
man."	1
Truth	1
is	1
so	1
terrible,	1
even	1
in	1
fetters,	1
that	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
Syme's	1
slender	1
and	1
insane	1
victory	1
swayed	1
like	1
a	1
reed.	1
But	1
you	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
guessed	1
it	1
from	1
Syme's	1
bleak	1
blue	1
eyes.	1
He	1
merely	1
began--	1
"Comrade	1
Gregory	1
commands--"	1
Then	1
the	1
spell	1
was	1
snapped,	1
and	1
one	1
anarchist	1
called	1
out	1
to	1
Gregory--	1
"Who	1
are	1
you?	1
You	1
are	1
not	1
Sunday";	1
and	1
another	1
anarchist	1
added	1
in	1
a	1
heavier	1
voice,	1
"And	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
Thursday."	1
"Comrades,"	1
cried	1
Gregory,	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
like	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
martyr	1
who	1
in	1
an	1
ecstacy	1
of	1
pain	1
has	1
passed	1
beyond	1
pain,	1
"it	1
is	1
nothing	1
to	1
me	1
whether	1
you	1
detest	1
me	1
as	1
a	1
tyrant	1
or	1
detest	1
me	1
as	1
a	1
slave.	1
If	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
take	1
my	1
command,	1
accept	1
my	1
degradation.	1
I	1
kneel	1
to	1
you.	1
I	1
throw	1
myself	1
at	1
your	1
feet.	1
I	1
implore	1
you.	1
Do	1
not	1
elect	1
this	1
man."	1
"Comrade	1
Gregory,"	1
said	1
the	1
chairman	1
after	1
a	1
painful	1
pause,	1
"this	1
is	1
really	1
not	1
quite	1
dignified."	1
For	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
in	1
the	1
proceedings	1
there	1
was	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
seconds	1
a	1
real	1
silence.	1
Then	1
Gregory	1
fell	1
back	1
in	1
his	1
seat,	1
a	1
pale	1
wreck	1
of	1
a	1
man,	1
and	1
the	1
chairman	1
repeated,	1
like	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
clock-work	1
suddenly	1
started	1
again--	1
"The	1
question	1
is	1
that	1
Comrade	1
Syme	1
be	1
elected	1
to	1
the	1
post	1
of	1
Thursday	1
on	1
the	1
General	1
Council."	1
The	1
roar	1
rose	1
like	1
the	1
sea,	1
the	1
hands	1
rose	1
like	1
a	1
forest,	1
and	1
three	1
minutes	1
afterwards	1
Mr.	1
Gabriel	1
Syme,	1
of	1
the	1
Secret	1
Police	1
Service,	1
was	1
elected	1
to	1
the	1
post	1
of	1
Thursday	1
on	1
the	1
General	1
Council	1
of	1
the	1
Anarchists	1
of	1
Europe.	1
Everyone	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
seemed	1
to	1
feel	1
the	1
tug	1
waiting	1
on	1
the	1
river,	1
the	1
sword-stick	1
and	1
the	1
revolver,	1
waiting	1
on	1
the	1
table.	1
The	1
instant	1
the	1
election	1
was	1
ended	1
and	1
irrevocable,	1
and	1
Syme	1
had	1
received	1
the	1
paper	1
proving	1
his	1
election,	1
they	1
all	1
sprang	1
to	1
their	1
feet,	1
and	1
the	1
fiery	1
groups	1
moved	1
and	1
mixed	1
in	1
the	1
room.	1
Syme	1
found	1
himself,	1
somehow	1
or	1
other,	1
face	1
to	1
face	1
with	1
Gregory,	1
who	1
still	1
regarded	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
stare	1
of	1
stunned	1
hatred.	1
They	1
were	1
silent	1
for	1
many	1
minutes.	1
"You	1
are	1
a	1
devil!"	1
said	1
Gregory	1
at	1
last.	1
"And	1
you	1
are	1
a	1
gentleman,"	1
said	1
Syme	1
with	1
gravity.	1
"It	1
was	1
you	1
that	1
entrapped	1
me,"	1
began	1
Gregory,	1
shaking	1
from	1
head	1
to	1
foot,	1
"entrapped	1
me	1
into--"	1
"Talk	1
sense,"	1
said	1
Syme	1
shortly.	1
"Into	1
what	1
sort	1
of	1
devils'	1
parliament	1
have	1
you	1
entrapped	1
me,	1
if	1
it	1
comes	1
to	1
that?	1
You	1
made	1
me	1
swear	1
before	1
I	1
made	1
you.	1
Perhaps	1
we	1
are	1
both	1
doing	1
what	1
we	1
think	1
right.	1
But	1
what	1
we	1
think	1
right	1
is	1
so	1
damned	1
different	1
that	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
nothing	1
between	1
us	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
concession.	1
There	1
is	1
nothing	1
possible	1
between	1
us	1
but	1
honour	1
and	1
death,"	1
and	1
he	1
pulled	1
the	1
great	1
cloak	1
about	1
his	1
shoulders	1
and	1
picked	1
up	1
the	1
flask	1
from	1
the	1
table.	1
"The	1
boat	1
is	1
quite	1
ready,"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Buttons,	1
bustling	1
up.	1
"Be	1
good	1
enough	1
to	1
step	1
this	1
way."	1
With	1
a	1
gesture	1
that	1
revealed	1
the	1
shop-walker,	1
he	1
led	1
Syme	1
down	1
a	1
short,	1
iron-bound	1
passage,	1
the	1
still	1
agonised	1
Gregory	1
following	1
feverishly	1
at	1
their	1
heels.	1
At	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
passage	1
was	1
a	1
door,	1
which	1
Buttons	1
opened	1
sharply,	1
showing	1
a	1
sudden	1
blue	1
and	1
silver	1
picture	1
of	1
the	1
moonlit	1
river,	1
that	1
looked	1
like	1
a	1
scene	1
in	1
a	1
theatre.	1
Close	1
to	1
the	1
opening	1
lay	1
a	1
dark,	1
dwarfish	1
steam-launch,	1
like	1
a	1
baby	1
dragon	1
with	1
one	1
red	1
eye.	1
Almost	1
in	1
the	1
act	1
of	1
stepping	1
on	1
board,	1
Gabriel	1
Syme	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
gaping	1
Gregory.	1
"You	1
have	1
kept	1
your	1
word,"	1
he	1
said	1
gently,	1
with	1
his	1
face	1
in	1
shadow.	1
"You	1
are	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
honour,	1
and	1
I	1
thank	1
you.	1
You	1
have	1
kept	1
it	1
even	1
down	1
to	1
a	1
small	1
particular.	1
There	1
was	1
one	1
special	1
thing	1
you	1
promised	1
me	1
at	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
affair,	1
and	1
which	1
you	1
have	1
certainly	1
given	1
me	1
by	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
it."	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
mean?"	1
cried	1
the	1
chaotic	1
Gregory.	1
"What	1
did	1
I	1
promise	1
you?"	1
"A	1
very	1
entertaining	1
evening,"	1
said	1
Syme,	1
and	1
he	1
made	1
a	1
military	1
salute	1
with	1
the	1
sword-stick	1
as	1
the	1
steamboat	1
slid	1
away.	1
CHAPTER	1
IV	1
THE	1
TALE	1
OF	1
A	1
DETECTIVE	1
GABRIEL	1
SYME	1
was	1
not	1
merely	1
a	1
detective	1
who	1
pretended	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
poet;	1
he	1
was	1
really	1
a	1
poet	1
who	1
had	1
become	1
a	1
detective.	1
Nor	1
was	1
his	1
hatred	1
of	1
anarchy	1
hypocritical.	1
He	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
driven	1
early	1
in	1
life	1
into	1
too	1
conservative	1
an	1
attitude	1
by	1
the	1
bewildering	1
folly	1
of	1
most	1
revolutionists.	1
He	1
had	1
not	1
attained	1
it	1
by	1
any	1
tame	1
tradition.	1
His	1
respectability	1
was	1
spontaneous	1
and	1
sudden,	1
a	1
rebellion	1
against	1
rebellion.	1
He	1
came	1
of	1
a	1
family	1
of	1
cranks,	1
in	1
which	1
all	1
the	1
oldest	1
people	1
had	1
all	1
the	1
newest	1
notions.	1
One	1
of	1
his	1
uncles	1
always	1
walked	1
about	1
without	1
a	1
hat,	1
and	1
another	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
unsuccessful	1
attempt	1
to	1
walk	1
about	1
with	1
a	1
hat	1
and	1
nothing	1
else.	1
His	1
father	1
cultivated	1
art	1
and	1
self-realisation;	1
his	1
mother	1
went	1
in	1
for	1
simplicity	1
and	1
hygiene.	1
Hence	1
the	1
child,	1
during	1
his	1
tenderer	1
years,	1
was	1
wholly	1
unacquainted	1
with	1
any	1
drink	1
between	1
the	1
extremes	1
of	1
absinth	1
and	1
cocoa,	1
of	1
both	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
healthy	1
dislike.	1
The	1
more	1
his	1
mother	1
preached	1
a	1
more	1
than	1
Puritan	1
abstinence	1
the	1
more	1
did	1
his	1
father	1
expand	1
into	1
a	1
more	1
than	1
pagan	1
latitude;	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
time	1
the	1
former	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
enforcing	1
vegetarianism,	1
the	1
latter	1
had	1
pretty	1
well	1
reached	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
defending	1
cannibalism.	1
Being	1
surrounded	1
with	1
every	1
conceivable	1
kind	1
of	1
revolt	1
from	1
infancy,	1
Gabriel	1
had	1
to	1
revolt	1
into	1
something,	1
so	1
he	1
revolted	1
into	1
the	1
only	1
thing	1
left--sanity.	1
But	1
there	1
was	1
just	1
enough	1
in	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
these	1
fanatics	1
to	1
make	1
even	1
his	1
protest	1
for	1
common	1
sense	1
a	1
little	1
too	1
fierce	1
to	1
be	1
sensible.	1
His	1
hatred	1
of	1
modern	1
lawlessness	1
had	1
been	1
crowned	1
also	1
by	1
an	1
accident.	1
It	1
happened	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
walking	1
in	1
a	1
side	1
street	1
at	1
the	1
instant	1
of	1
a	1
dynamite	1
outrage.	1
He	1
had	1
been	1
blind	1
and	1
deaf	1
for	1
a	1
moment,	1
and	1
then	1
seen,	1
the	1
smoke	1
clearing,	1
the	1
broken	1
windows	1
and	1
the	1
bleeding	1
faces.	1
After	1
that	1
he	1
went	1
about	1
as	1
usual--quiet,	1
courteous,	1
rather	1
gentle;	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
spot	1
on	1
his	1
mind	1
that	1
was	1
not	1
sane.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
regard	1
anarchists,	1
as	1
most	1
of	1
us	1
do,	1
as	1
a	1
handful	1
of	1
morbid	1
men,	1
combining	1
ignorance	1
with	1
intellectualism.	1
He	1
regarded	1
them	1
as	1
a	1
huge	1
and	1
pitiless	1
peril,	1
like	1
a	1
Chinese	1
invasion.	1
He	1
poured	1
perpetually	1
into	1
newspapers	1
and	1
their	1
waste-paper	1
baskets	1
a	1
torrent	1
of	1
tales,	1
verses	1
and	1
violent	1
articles,	1
warning	1
men	1
of	1
this	1
deluge	1
of	1
barbaric	1
denial.	1
But	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
getting	1
no	1
nearer	1
his	1
enemy,	1
and,	1
what	1
was	1
worse,	1
no	1
nearer	1
a	1
living.	1
As	1
he	1
paced	1
the	1
Thames	1
embankment,	1
bitterly	1
biting	1
a	1
cheap	1
cigar	1
and	1
brooding	1
on	1
the	1
advance	1
of	1
Anarchy,	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
anarchist	1
with	1
a	1
bomb	1
in	1
his	1
pocket	1
so	1
savage	1
or	1
so	1
solitary	1
as	1
he.	1
Indeed,	1
he	1
always	1
felt	1
that	1
Government	1
stood	1
alone	1
and	1
desperate,	1
with	1
its	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
wall.	1
He	1
was	1
too	1
quixotic	1
to	1
have	1
cared	1
for	1
it	1
otherwise.	1
He	1
walked	1
on	1
the	1
Embankment	1
once	1
under	1
a	1
dark	1
red	1
sunset.	1
The	1
red	1
river	1
reflected	1
the	1
red	1
sky,	1
and	1
they	1
both	1
reflected	1
his	1
anger.	1
The	1
sky,	1
indeed,	1
was	1
so	1
swarthy,	1
and	1
the	1
light	1
on	1
the	1
river	1
relatively	1
so	1
lurid,	1
that	1
the	1
water	1
almost	1
seemed	1
of	1
fiercer	1
flame	1
than	1
the	1
sunset	1
it	1
mirrored.	1
It	1
looked	1
like	1
a	1
stream	1
of	1
literal	1
fire	1
winding	1
under	1
the	1
vast	1
caverns	1
of	1
a	1
subterranean	1
country.	1
Syme	1
was	1
shabby	1
in	1
those	1
days.	1
He	1
wore	1
an	1
old-fashioned	1
black	1
chimney-pot	1
hat;	1
he	1
was	1
wrapped	1
in	1
a	1
yet	1
more	1
old-fashioned	1
cloak,	1
black	1
and	1
ragged;	1
and	1
the	1
combination	1
gave	1
him	1
the	1
look	1
of	1
the	1
early	1
villains	1
in	1
Dickens	1
and	1
Bulwer	1
Lytton.	1
Also	1
his	1
yellow	1
beard	1
and	1
hair	1
were	1
more	1
unkempt	1
and	1
leonine	1
than	1
when	1
they	1
appeared	1
long	1
afterwards,	1
cut	1
and	1
pointed,	1
on	1
the	1
lawns	1
of	1
Saffron	1
Park.	1
A	1
long,	1
lean,	1
black	1
cigar,	1
bought	1
in	1
Soho	1
for	1
twopence,	1
stood	1
out	1
from	1
between	1
his	1
tightened	1
teeth,	1
and	1
altogether	1
he	1
looked	1
a	1
very	1
satisfactory	1
specimen	1
of	1
the	1
anarchists	1
upon	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
vowed	1
a	1
holy	1
war.	1
Perhaps	1
this	1
was	1
why	1
a	1
policeman	1
on	1
the	1
Embankment	1
spoke	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
said	1
"Good	1
evening."	1
Syme,	1
at	1
a	1
crisis	1
of	1
his	1
morbid	1
fears	1
for	1
humanity,	1
seemed	1
stung	1
by	1
the	1
mere	1
stolidity	1
of	1
the	1
automatic	1
official,	1
a	1
mere	1
bulk	1
of	1
blue	1
in	1
the	1
twilight.	1
"A	1
good	1
evening	1
is	1
it?"	1
he	1
said	1
sharply.	1
"You	1
fellows	1
would	1
call	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
a	1
good	1
evening.	1
Look	1
at	1
that	1
bloody	1
red	1
sun	1
and	1
that	1
bloody	1
river!	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
if	1
that	1
were	1
literally	1
human	1
blood,	1
spilt	1
and	1
shining,	1
you	1
would	1
still	1
be	1
standing	1
here	1
as	1
solid	1
as	1
ever,	1
looking	1
out	1
for	1
some	1
poor	1
harmless	1
tramp	1
whom	1
you	1
could	1
move	1
on.	1
You	1
policemen	1
are	1
cruel	1
to	1
the	1
poor,	1
but	1
I	1
could	1
forgive	1
you	1
even	1
your	1
cruelty	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
not	1
for	1
your	1
calm."	1
"If	1
we	1
are	1
calm,"	1
replied	1
the	1
policeman,	1
"it	1
is	1
the	1
calm	1
of	1
organised	1
resistance."	1
"Eh?"	1
said	1
Syme,	1
staring.	1
"The	1
soldier	1
must	1
be	1
calm	1
in	1
the	1
thick	1
of	1
the	1
battle,"	1
pursued	1
the	1
policeman.	1
"The	1
composure	1
of	1
an	1
army	1
is	1
the	1
anger	1
of	1
a	1
nation."	1
"Good	1
God,	1
the	1
Board	1
Schools!"	1
said	1
Syme.	1
"Is	1
this	1
undenominational	1
education?"	1
"No,"	1
said	1
the	1
policeman	1
sadly,	1
"I	1
never	1
had	1
any	1
of	1
those	1
advantages.	1
The	1
Board	1
Schools	1
came	1
after	1
my	1
time.	1
What	1
education	1
I	1
had	1
was	1
very	1
rough	1
and	1
old-fashioned,	1
I	1
am	1
afraid."	1
"Where	1
did	1
you	1
have	1
it?"	1
asked	1
Syme,	1
wondering.	1
"Oh,	1
at	1
Harrow,"	1
said	1
the	1
policeman	1
The	1
class	1
sympathies	1
which,	1
false	1
as	1
they	1
are,	1
are	1
the	1
truest	1
things	1
in	1
so	1
many	1
men,	1
broke	1
out	1
of	1
Syme	1
before	1
he	1
could	1
control	1
them.	1
"But,	1
good	1
Lord,	1
man,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"you	1
oughtn't	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
policeman!"	1
The	1
policeman	1
sighed	1
and	1
shook	1
his	1
head.	1
"I	1
know,"	1
he	1
said	1
solemnly,	1
"I	1
know	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
worthy."	1
"But	1
why	1
did	1
you	1
join	1
the	1
police?"	1
asked	1
Syme	1
with	1
rude	1
curiosity.	1
"For	1
much	1
the	1
same	1
reason	1
that	1
you	1
abused	1
the	1
police,"	1
replied	1
the	1
other.	1
"I	1
found	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
special	1
opening	1
in	1
the	1
service	1
for	1
those	1
whose	1
fears	1
for	1
humanity	1
were	1
concerned	1
rather	1
with	1
the	1
aberrations	1
of	1
the	1
scientific	1
intellect	1
than	1
with	1
the	1
normal	1
and	1
excusable,	1
though	1
excessive,	1
outbreaks	1
of	1
the	1
human	1
will.	1
I	1
trust	1
I	1
make	1
myself	1
clear."	1
"If	1
you	1
mean	1
that	1
you	1
make	1
your	1
opinion	1
clear,"	1
said	1
Syme,	1
"I	1
suppose	1
you	1
do.	1
But	1
as	1
for	1
making	1
yourself	1
clear,	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
last	1
thing	1
you	1
do.	1
How	1
comes	1
a	1
man	1
like	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
talking	1
philosophy	1
in	1
a	1
blue	1
helmet	1
on	1
the	1
Thames	1
embankment?	1
"You	1
have	1
evidently	1
not	1
heard	1
of	1
the	1
latest	1
development	1
in	1
our	1
police	1
system,"	1
replied	1
the	1
other.	1
"I	1
am	1
not	1
surprised	1
at	1
it.	1
We	1
are	1
keeping	1
it	1
rather	1
dark	1
from	1
the	1
educated	1
class,	1
because	1
that	1
class	1
contains	1
most	1
of	1
our	1
enemies.	1
But	1
you	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
exactly	1
in	1
the	1
right	1
frame	1
of	1
mind.	1
I	1
think	1
you	1
might	1
almost	1
join	1
us."	1
"Join	1
you	1
in	1
what?"	1
asked	1
Syme.	1
"I	1
will	1
tell	1
you,"	1
said	1
the	1
policeman	1
slowly.	1
"This	1
is	1
the	1
situation:	1
The	1
head	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
our	1
departments,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
celebrated	1
detectives	1
in	1
Europe,	1
has	1
long	1
been	1
of	1
opinion	1
that	1
a	1
purely	1
intellectual	1
conspiracy	1
would	1
soon	1
threaten	1
the	1
very	1
existence	1
of	1
civilisation.	1
He	1
is	1
certain	1
that	1
the	1
scientific	1
and	1
artistic	1
worlds	1
are	1
silently	1
bound	1
in	1
a	1
crusade	1
against	1
the	1
Family	1
and	1
the	1
State.	1
He	1
has,	1
therefore,	1
formed	1
a	1
special	1
corps	1
of	1
policemen,	1
policemen	1
who	1
are	1
also	1
philosophers.	1
It	1
is	1
their	1
business	1
to	1
watch	1
the	1
beginnings	1
of	1
this	1
conspiracy,	1
not	1
merely	1
in	1
a	1
criminal	1
but	1
in	1
a	1
controversial	1
sense.	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
democrat	1
myself,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
fully	1
aware	1
of	1
the	1
value	1
of	1
the	1
ordinary	1
man	1
in	1
matters	1
of	1
ordinary	1
valour	1
or	1
virtue.	1
But	1
it	1
would	1
obviously	1
be	1
undesirable	1
to	1
employ	1
the	1
common	1
policeman	1
in	1
an	1
investigation	1
which	1
is	1
also	1
a	1
heresy	1
hunt."	1
Syme's	1
eyes	1
were	1
bright	1
with	1
a	1
sympathetic	1
curiosity.	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
do,	1
then?"	1
he	1
said.	1
"The	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
philosophical	1
policeman,"	1
replied	1
the	1
man	1
in	1
blue,	1
"is	1
at	1
once	1
bolder	1
and	1
more	1
subtle	1
than	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
ordinary	1
detective.	1
The	1
ordinary	1
detective	1
goes	1
to	1
pot-houses	1
to	1
arrest	1
thieves;	1
we	1
go	1
to	1
artistic	1
tea-parties	1
to	1
detect	1
pessimists.	1
The	1
ordinary	1
detective	1
discovers	1
from	1
a	1
ledger	1
or	1
a	1
diary	1
that	1
a	1
crime	1
has	1
been	1
committed.	1
We	1
discover	1
from	1
a	1
book	1
of	1
sonnets	1
that	1
a	1
crime	1
will	1
be	1
committed.	1
We	1
have	1
to	1
trace	1
the	1
origin	1
of	1
those	1
dreadful	1
thoughts	1
that	1
drive	1
men	1
on	1
at	1
last	1
to	1
intellectual	1
fanaticism	1
and	1
intellectual	1
crime.	1
We	1
were	1
only	1
just	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
prevent	1
the	1
assassination	1
at	1
Hartle	1
pool,	1
and	1
that	1
was	1
entirely	1
due	1
to	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
our	1
Mr.	1
Wilks	1
(a	1
smart	1
young	1
fellow)	1
thoroughly	1
understood	1
a	1
triolet."	1
"Do	1
you	1
mean,"	1
asked	1
Syme,	1
"that	1
there	1
is	1
really	1
as	1
much	1
connection	1
between	1
crime	1
and	1
the	1
modern	1
intellect	1
as	1
all	1
that?"	1
"You	1
are	1
not	1
sufficiently	1
democratic,"	1
answered	1
the	1
policeman,	1
"but	1
you	1
were	1
right	1
when	1
you	1
said	1
just	1
now	1
that	1
our	1
ordinary	1
treatment	1
of	1
the	1
poor	1
criminal	1
was	1
a	1
pretty	1
brutal	1
business.	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
I	1
am	1
sometimes	1
sick	1
of	1
my	1
trade	1
when	1
I	1
see	1
how	1
perpetually	1
it	1
means	1
merely	1
a	1
war	1
upon	1
the	1
ignorant	1
and	1
the	1
desperate.	1
But	1
this	1
new	1
movement	1
of	1
ours	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
different	1
affair.	1
We	1
deny	1
the	1
snobbish	1
English	1
assumption	1
that	1
the	1
uneducated	1
are	1
the	1
dangerous	1
criminals.	1
We	1
remember	1
the	1
Roman	1
Emperors.	1
We	1
remember	1
the	1
great	1
poisoning	1
princes	1
of	1
the	1
Renaissance.	1
We	1
say	1
that	1
the	1
dangerous	1
criminal	1
is	1
the	1
educated	1
criminal.	1
We	1
say	1
that	1
the	1
most	1
dangerous	1
criminal	1
now	1
is	1
the	1
entirely	1
lawless	1
modern	1
philosopher.	1
Compared	1
to	1
him,	1
burglars	1
and	1
bigamists	1
are	1
essentially	1
moral	1
men;	1
my	1
heart	1
goes	1
out	1
to	1
them.	1
They	1
accept	1
the	1
essential	1
ideal	1
of	1
man;	1
they	1
merely	1
seek	1
it	1
wrongly.	1
Thieves	1
respect	1
property.	1
They	1
merely	1
wish	1
the	1
property	1
to	1
become	1
their	1
property	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
more	1
perfectly	1
respect	1
it.	1
But	1
philosophers	1
dislike	1
property	1
as	1
property;	1
they	1
wish	1
to	1
destroy	1
the	1
very	1
idea	1
of	1
personal	1
possession.	1
Bigamists	1
respect	1
marriage,	1
or	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
go	1
through	1
the	1
highly	1
ceremonial	1
and	1
even	1
ritualistic	1
formality	1
of	1
bigamy.	1
But	1
philosophers	1
despise	1
marriage	1
as	1
marriage.	1
Murderers	1
respect	1
human	1
life;	1
they	1
merely	1
wish	1
to	1
attain	1
a	1
greater	1
fulness	1
of	1
human	1
life	1
in	1
themselves	1
by	1
the	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
what	1
seems	1
to	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
lesser	1
lives.	1
But	1
philosophers	1
hate	1
life	1
itself,	1
their	1
own	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
other	1
people's."	1
Syme	1
struck	1
his	1
hands	1
together.	1
"How	1
true	1
that	1
is,"	1
he	1
cried.	1
"I	1
have	1
felt	1
it	1
from	1
my	1
boyhood,	1
but	1
never	1
could	1
state	1
the	1
verbal	1
antithesis.	1
The	1
common	1
criminal	1
is	1
a	1
bad	1
man,	1
but	1
at	1
least	1
he	1
is,	1
as	1
it	1
were,	1
a	1
conditional	1
good	1
man.	1
He	1
says	1
that	1
if	1
only	1
a	1
certain	1
obstacle	1
be	1
removed--say	1
a	1
wealthy	1
uncle--he	1
is	1
then	1
prepared	1
to	1
accept	1
the	1
universe	1
and	1
to	1
praise	1
God.	1
He	1
is	1
a	1
reformer,	1
but	1
not	1
an	1
anarchist.	1
He	1
wishes	1
to	1
cleanse	1
the	1
edifice,	1
but	1
not	1
to	1
destroy	1
it.	1
But	1
the	1
evil	1
philosopher	1
is	1
not	1
trying	1
to	1
alter	1
things,	1
but	1
to	1
annihilate	1
them.	1
Yes,	1
the	1
modern	1
world	1
has	1
retained	1
all	1
those	1
parts	1
of	1
police	1
work	1
which	1
are	1
really	1
oppressive	1
and	1
ignominious,	1
the	1
harrying	1
of	1
the	1
poor,	1
the	1
spying	1
upon	1
the	1
unfortunate.	1
It	1
has	1
given	1
up	1
its	1
more	1
dignified	1
work,	1
the	1
punishment	1
of	1
powerful	1
traitors	1
the	1
in	1
the	1
State	1
and	1
powerful	1
heresiarchs	1
in	1
the	1
Church.	1
The	1
moderns	1
say	1
we	1
must	1
not	1
punish	1
heretics.	1
My	1
only	1
doubt	1
is	1
whether	1
we	1
have	1
a	1
right	1
to	1
punish	1
anybody	1
else."	1
"But	1
this	1
is	1
absurd!"	1
cried	1
the	1
policeman,	1
clasping	1
his	1
hands	1
with	1
an	1
excitement	1
uncommon	1
in	1
persons	1
of	1
his	1
figure	1
and	1
costume,	1
"but	1
it	1
is	1
intolerable!	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
what	1
you're	1
doing,	1
but	1
you're	1
wasting	1
your	1
life.	1
You	1
must,	1
you	1
shall,	1
join	1
our	1
special	1
army	1
against	1
anarchy.	1
Their	1
armies	1
are	1
on	1
our	1
frontiers.	1
Their	1
bolt	1
is	1
ready	1
to	1
fall.	1
A	1
moment	1
more,	1
and	1
you	1
may	1
lose	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
working	1
with	1
us,	1
perhaps	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
dying	1
with	1
the	1
last	1
heroes	1
of	1
the	1
world."	1
"It	1
is	1
a	1
chance	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
missed,	1
certainly,"	1
assented	1
Syme,	1
"but	1
still	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
quite	1
understand.	1
I	1
know	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
anybody	1
that	1
the	1
modern	1
world	1
is	1
full	1
of	1
lawless	1
little	1
men	1
and	1
mad	1
little	1
movements.	1
But,	1
beastly	1
as	1
they	1
are,	1
they	1
generally	1
have	1
the	1
one	1
merit	1
of	1
disagreeing	1
with	1
each	1
other.	1
How	1
can	1
you	1
talk	1
of	1
their	1
leading	1
one	1
army	1
or	1
hurling	1
one	1
bolt.	1
What	1
is	1
this	1
anarchy?"	1
"Do	1
not	1
confuse	1
it,"	1
replied	1
the	1
constable,	1
"with	1
those	1
chance	1
dynamite	1
outbreaks	1
from	1
Russia	1
or	1
from	1
Ireland,	1
which	1
are	1
really	1
the	1
outbreaks	1
of	1
oppressed,	1
if	1
mistaken,	1
men.	1
This	1
is	1
a	1
vast	1
philosophic	1
movement,	1
consisting	1
of	1
an	1
outer	1
and	1
an	1
inner	1
ring.	1
You	1
might	1
even	1
call	1
the	1
outer	1
ring	1
the	1
laity	1
and	1
the	1
inner	1
ring	1
the	1
priesthood.	1
I	1
prefer	1
to	1
call	1
the	1
outer	1
ring	1
the	1
innocent	1
section,	1
the	1
inner	1
ring	1
the	1
supremely	1
guilty	1
section.	1
The	1
outer	1
ring--the	1
main	1
mass	1
of	1
their	1
supporters--are	1
merely	1
anarchists;	1
that	1
is,	1
men	1
who	1
believe	1
that	1
rules	1
and	1
formulas	1
have	1
destroyed	1
human	1
happiness.	1
They	1
believe	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
evil	1
results	1
of	1
human	1
crime	1
are	1
the	1
results	1
of	1
the	1
system	1
that	1
has	1
called	1
it	1
crime.	1
They	1
do	1
not	1
believe	1
that	1
the	1
crime	1
creates	1
the	1
punishment.	1
They	1
believe	1
that	1
the	1
punishment	1
has	1
created	1
the	1
crime.	1
They	1
believe	1
that	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
seduced	1
seven	1
women	1
he	1
would	1
naturally	1
walk	1
away	1
as	1
blameless	1
as	1
the	1
flowers	1
of	1
spring.	1
They	1
believe	1
that	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
picked	1
a	1
pocket	1
he	1
would	1
naturally	1
feel	1
exquisitely	1
good.	1
These	1
I	1
call	1
the	1
innocent	1
section."	1
"Oh!"	1
said	1
Syme.	1
"Naturally,	1
therefore,	1
these	1
people	1
talk	1
about	1
'a	1
happy	1
time	1
coming';	1
'the	1
paradise	1
of	1
the	1
future';	1
'mankind	1
freed	1
from	1
the	1
bondage	1
of	1
vice	1
and	1
the	1
bondage	1
of	1
virtue,'	1
and	1
so	1
on.	1
And	1
so	1
also	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
inner	1
circle	1
speak--the	1
sacred	1
priesthood.	1
They	1
also	1
speak	1
to	1
applauding	1
crowds	1
of	1
the	1
happiness	1
of	1
the	1
future,	1
and	1
of	1
mankind	1
freed	1
at	1
last.	1
But	1
in	1
their	1
mouths"--and	1
the	1
policeman	1
lowered	1
his	1
voice--"in	1
their	1
mouths	1
these	1
happy	1
phrases	1
have	1
a	1
horrible	1
meaning.	1
They	1
are	1
under	1
no	1
illusions;	1
they	1
are	1
too	1
intellectual	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
man	1
upon	1
this	1
earth	1
can	1
ever	1
be	1
quite	1
free	1
of	1
original	1
sin	1
and	1
the	1
struggle.	1
And	1
they	1
mean	1
death.	1
When	1
they	1
say	1
that	1
mankind	1
shall	1
be	1
free	1
at	1
last,	1
they	1
mean	1
that	1
mankind	1
shall	1
commit	1
suicide.	1
When	1
they	1
talk	1
of	1
a	1
paradise	1
without	1
right	1
or	1
wrong,	1
they	1
mean	1
the	1
grave.	1
They	1
have	1
but	1
two	1
objects,	1
to	1
destroy	1
first	1
humanity	1
and	1
then	1
themselves.	1
That	1
is	1
why	1
they	1
throw	1
bombs	1
instead	1
of	1
firing	1
pistols.	1
The	1
innocent	1
rank	1
and	1
file	1
are	1
disappointed	1
because	1
the	1
bomb	1
has	1
not	1
killed	1
the	1
king;	1
but	1
the	1
high-priesthood	1
are	1
happy	1
because	1
it	1
has	1
killed	1
somebody."	1
"How	1
can	1
I	1
join	1
you?"	1
asked	1
Syme,	1
with	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
passion.	1
"I	1
know	1
for	1
a	1
fact	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
vacancy	1
at	1
the	1
moment,"	1
said	1
the	1
policeman,	1
"as	1
I	1
have	1
the	1
honour	1
to	1
be	1
somewhat	1
in	1
the	1
confidence	1
of	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
spoken.	1
You	1
should	1
really	1
come	1
and	1
see	1
him.	1
Or	1
rather,	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
say	1
see	1
him,	1
nobody	1
ever	1
sees	1
him;	1
but	1
you	1
can	1
talk	1
to	1
him	1
if	1
you	1
like."	1
"Telephone?"	1
inquired	1
Syme,	1
with	1
interest.	1
"No,"	1
said	1
the	1
policeman	1
placidly,	1
"he	1
has	1
a	1
fancy	1
for	1
always	1
sitting	1
in	1
a	1
pitch-dark	1
room.	1
He	1
says	1
it	1
makes	1
his	1
thoughts	1
brighter.	1
Do	1
come	1
along."	1
Somewhat	1
dazed	1
and	1
considerably	1
excited,	1
Syme	1
allowed	1
himself	1
to	1
be	1
led	1
to	1
a	1
side-door	1
in	1
the	1
long	1
row	1
of	1
buildings	1
of	1
Scotland	1
Yard.	1
Almost	1
before	1
he	1
knew	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
doing,	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
passed	1
through	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
about	1
four	1
intermediate	1
officials,	1
and	1
was	1
suddenly	1
shown	1
into	1
a	1
room,	1
the	1
abrupt	1
blackness	1
of	1
which	1
startled	1
him	1
like	1
a	1
blaze	1
of	1
light.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
ordinary	1
darkness,	1
in	1
which	1
forms	1
can	1
be	1
faintly	1
traced;	1
it	1
was	1
like	1
going	1
suddenly	1
stone-blind.	1
"Are	1
you	1
the	1
new	1
recruit?"	1
asked	1
a	1
heavy	1
voice.	1
And	1
in	1
some	1
strange	1
way,	1
though	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
a	1
shape	1
in	1
the	1
gloom,	1
Syme	1
knew	1
two	1
things:	1
first,	1
that	1
it	1
came	1
from	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
massive	1
stature;	1
and	1
second,	1
that	1
the	1
man	1
had	1
his	1
back	1
to	1
him.	1
"Are	1
you	1
the	1
new	1
recruit?"	1
said	1
the	1
invisible	1
chief,	1
who	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
heard	1
all	1
about	1
it.	1
"All	1
right.	1
You	1
are	1
engaged."	1
Syme,	1
quite	1
swept	1
off	1
his	1
feet,	1
made	1
a	1
feeble	1
fight	1
against	1
this	1
irrevocable	1
phrase.	1
"I	1
really	1
have	1
no	1
experience,"	1
he	1
began.	1
"No	1
one	1
has	1
any	1
experience,"	1
said	1
the	1
other,	1
"of	1
the	1
Battle	1
of	1
Armageddon."	1
"But	1
I	1
am	1
really	1
unfit--"	1
"You	1
are	1
willing,	1
that	1
is	1
enough,"	1
said	1
the	1
unknown.	1
"Well,	1
really,"	1
said	1
Syme,	1
"I	1
don't	1
know	1
any	1
profession	1
of	1
which	1
mere	1
willingness	1
is	1
the	1
final	1
test."	1
"I	1
do,"	1
said	1
the	1
other--"martyrs.	1
I	1
am	1
condemning	1
you	1
to	1
death.	1
Good	1
day."	1
Thus	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
when	1
Gabriel	1
Syme	1
came	1
out	1
again	1
into	1
the	1
crimson	1
light	1
of	1
evening,	1
in	1
his	1
shabby	1
black	1
hat	1
and	1
shabby,	1
lawless	1
cloak,	1
he	1
came	1
out	1
a	1
member	1
of	1
the	1
New	1
Detective	1
Corps	1
for	1
the	1
frustration	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
conspiracy.	1
Acting	1
under	1
the	1
advice	1
of	1
his	1
friend	1
the	1
policeman	1
(who	1
was	1
professionally	1
inclined	1
to	1
neatness),	1
he	1
trimmed	1
his	1
hair	1
and	1
beard,	1
bought	1
a	1
good	1
hat,	1
clad	1
himself	1
in	1
an	1
exquisite	1
summer	1
suit	1
of	1
light	1
blue-grey,	1
with	1
a	1
pale	1
yellow	1
flower	1
in	1
the	1
button-hole,	1
and,	1
in	1
short,	1
became	1
that	1
elegant	1
and	1
rather	1
insupportable	1
person	1
whom	1
Gregory	1
had	1
first	1
encountered	1
in	1
the	1
little	1
garden	1
of	1
Saffron	1
Park.	1
Before	1
he	1
finally	1
left	1
the	1
police	1
premises	1
his	1
friend	1
provided	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
small	1
blue	1
card,	1
on	1
which	1
was	1
written,	1
"The	1
Last	1
Crusade,"	1
and	1
a	1
number,	1
the	1
sign	1
of	1
his	1
official	1
authority.	1
He	1
put	1
this	1
carefully	1
in	1
his	1
upper	1
waistcoat	1
pocket,	1
lit	1
a	1
cigarette,	1
and	1
went	1
forth	1
to	1
track	1
and	1
fight	1
the	1
enemy	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
drawing-rooms	1
of	1
London.	1
Where	1
his	1
adventure	1
ultimately	1
led	1
him	1
we	1
have	1
already	1
seen.	1
At	1
about	1
half-past	1
one	1
on	1
a	1
February	1
night	1
he	1
found	1
himself	1
steaming	1
in	1
a	1
small	1
tug	1
up	1
the	1
silent	1
Thames,	1
armed	1
with	1
swordstick	1
and	1
revolver,	1
the	1
duly	1
elected	1
Thursday	1
of	1
the	1
Central	1
Council	1
of	1
Anarchists.	1
When	1
Syme	1
stepped	1
out	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
steam-tug	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
singular	1
sensation	1
of	1
stepping	1
out	1
into	1
something	1
entirely	1
new;	1
not	1
merely	1
into	1
the	1
landscape	1
of	1
a	1
new	1
land,	1
but	1
even	1
into	1
the	1
landscape	1
of	1
a	1
new	1
planet.	1
This	1
was	1
mainly	1
due	1
to	1
the	1
insane	1
yet	1
solid	1
decision	1
of	1
that	1
evening,	1
though	1
partly	1
also	1
to	1
an	1
entire	1
change	1
in	1
the	1
weather	1
and	1
the	1
sky	1
since	1
he	1
entered	1
the	1
little	1
tavern	1
some	1
two	1
hours	1
before.	1
Every	1
trace	1
of	1
the	1
passionate	1
plumage	1
of	1
the	1
cloudy	1
sunset	1
had	1
been	1
swept	1
away,	1
and	1
a	1
naked	1
moon	1
stood	1
in	1
a	1
naked	1
sky.	1
The	1
moon	1
was	1
so	1
strong	1
and	1
full	1
that	1
(by	1
a	1
paradox	1
often	1
to	1
be	1
noticed)	1
it	1
seemed	1
like	1
a	1
weaker	1
sun.	1
It	1
gave,	1
not	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
bright	1
moonshine,	1
but	1
rather	1
of	1
a	1
dead	1
daylight.	1
Over	1
the	1
whole	1
landscape	1
lay	1
a	1
luminous	1
and	1
unnatural	1
discoloration,	1
as	1
of	1
that	1
disastrous	1
twilight	1
which	1
Milton	1
spoke	1
of	1
as	1
shed	1
by	1
the	1
sun	1
in	1
eclipse;	1
so	1
that	1
Syme	1
fell	1
easily	1
into	1
his	1
first	1
thought,	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
actually	1
on	1
some	1
other	1
and	1
emptier	1
planet,	1
which	1
circled	1
round	1
some	1
sadder	1
star.	1
But	1
the	1
more	1
he	1
felt	1
this	1
glittering	1
desolation	1
in	1
the	1
moonlit	1
land,	1
the	1
more	1
his	1
own	1
chivalric	1
folly	1
glowed	1
in	1
the	1
night	1
like	1
a	1
great	1
fire.	1
Even	1
the	1
common	1
things	1
he	1
carried	1
with	1
him--the	1
food	1
and	1
the	1
brandy	1
and	1
the	1
loaded	1
pistol--took	1
on	1
exactly	1
that	1
concrete	1
and	1
material	1
poetry	1
which	1
a	1
child	1
feels	1
when	1
he	1
takes	1
a	1
gun	1
upon	1
a	1
journey	1
or	1
a	1
bun	1
with	1
him	1
to	1
bed.	1
The	1
sword-stick	1
and	1
the	1
brandy-flask,	1
though	1
in	1
themselves	1
only	1
the	1
tools	1
of	1
morbid	1
conspirators,	1
became	1
the	1
expressions	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
more	1
healthy	1
romance.	1
The	1
sword-stick	1
became	1
almost	1
the	1
sword	1
of	1
chivalry,	1
and	1
the	1
brandy	1
the	1
wine	1
of	1
the	1
stirrup-cup.	1
For	1
even	1
the	1
most	1
dehumanised	1
modern	1
fantasies	1
depend	1
on	1
some	1
older	1
and	1
simpler	1
figure;	1
the	1
adventures	1
may	1
be	1
mad,	1
but	1
the	1
adventurer	1
must	1
be	1
sane.	1
The	1
dragon	1
without	1
St.	1
George	1
would	1
not	1
even	1
be	1
grotesque.	1
So	1
this	1
inhuman	1
landscape	1
was	1
only	1
imaginative	1
by	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
really	1
human.	1
To	1
Syme's	1
exaggerative	1
mind	1
the	1
bright,	1
bleak	1
houses	1
and	1
terraces	1
by	1
the	1
Thames	1
looked	1
as	1
empty	1
as	1
the	1
mountains	1
of	1
the	1
moon.	1
But	1
even	1
the	1
moon	1
is	1
only	1
poetical	1
because	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
moon.	1
The	1
tug	1
was	1
worked	1
by	1
two	1
men,	1
and	1
with	1
much	1
toil	1
went	1
comparatively	1
slowly.	1
The	1
clear	1
moon	1
that	1
had	1
lit	1
up	1
Chiswick	1
had	1
gone	1
down	1
by	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
they	1
passed	1
Battersea,	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
came	1
under	1
the	1
enormous	1
bulk	1
of	1
Westminster	1
day	1
had	1
already	1
begun	1
to	1
break.	1
It	1
broke	1
like	1
the	1
splitting	1
of	1
great	1
bars	1
of	1
lead,	1
showing	1
bars	1
of	1
silver;	1
and	1
these	1
had	1
brightened	1
like	1
white	1
fire	1
when	1
the	1
tug,	1
changing	1
its	1
onward	1
course,	1
turned	1
inward	1
to	1
a	1
large	1
landing	1
stage	1
rather	1
beyond	1
Charing	1
Cross.	1
The	1
great	1
stones	1
of	1
the	1
Embankment	1
seemed	1
equally	1
dark	1
and	1
gigantic	1
as	1
Syme	1
looked	1
up	1
at	1
them.	1
They	1
were	1
big	1
and	1
black	1
against	1
the	1
huge	1
white	1
dawn.	1
They	1
made	1
him	1
feel	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
landing	1
on	1
the	1
colossal	1
steps	1
of	1
some	1
Egyptian	1
palace;	1
and,	1
indeed,	1
the	1
thing	1
suited	1
his	1
mood,	1
for	1
he	1
was,	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
mind,	1
mounting	1
to	1
attack	1
the	1
solid	1
thrones	1
of	1
horrible	1
and	1
heathen	1
kings.	1
He	1
leapt	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
boat	1
on	1
to	1
one	1
slimy	1
step,	1
and	1
stood,	1
a	1
dark	1
and	1
slender	1
figure,	1
amid	1
the	1
enormous	1
masonry.	1
The	1
two	1
men	1
in	1
the	1
tug	1
put	1
her	1
off	1
again	1
and	1
turned	1
up	1
stream.	1
They	1
had	1
never	1
spoken	1
a	1
word.	1
CHAPTER	1
V	1
THE	1
FEAST	1
OF	1
FEAR	1
AT	1
first	1
the	1
large	1
stone	1
stair	1
seemed	1
to	1
Syme	1
as	1
deserted	1
as	1
a	1
pyramid;	1
but	1
before	1
he	1
reached	1
the	1
top	1
he	1
had	1
realised	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
leaning	1
over	1
the	1
parapet	1
of	1
the	1
Embankment	1
and	1
looking	1
out	1
across	1
the	1
river.	1
As	1
a	1
figure	1
he	1
was	1
quite	1
conventional,	1
clad	1
in	1
a	1
silk	1
hat	1
and	1
frock-coat	1
of	1
the	1
more	1
formal	1
type	1
of	1
fashion;	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
red	1
flower	1
in	1
his	1
buttonhole.	1
As	1
Syme	1
drew	1
nearer	1
to	1
him	1
step	1
by	1
step,	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
move	1
a	1
hair;	1
and	1
Syme	1
could	1
come	1
close	1
enough	1
to	1
notice	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
dim,	1
pale	1
morning	1
light	1
that	1
his	1
face	1
was	1
long,	1
pale	1
and	1
intellectual,	1
and	1
ended	1
in	1
a	1
small	1
triangular	1
tuft	1
of	1
dark	1
beard	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
point	1
of	1
the	1
chin,	1
all	1
else	1
being	1
clean-shaven.	1
This	1
scrap	1
of	1
hair	1
almost	1
seemed	1
a	1
mere	1
oversight;	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
face	1
was	1
of	1
the	1
type	1
that	1
is	1
best	1
shaven--clear-cut,	1
ascetic,	1
and	1
in	1
its	1
way	1
noble.	1
Syme	1
drew	1
closer	1
and	1
closer,	1
noting	1
all	1
this,	1
and	1
still	1
the	1
figure	1
did	1
not	1
stir.	1
At	1
first	1
an	1
instinct	1
had	1
told	1
Syme	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
man	1
whom	1
he	1
was	1
meant	1
to	1
meet.	1
Then,	1
seeing	1
that	1
the	1
man	1
made	1
no	1
sign,	1
he	1
had	1
concluded	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not.	1
And	1
now	1
again	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
back	1
to	1
a	1
certainty	1
that	1
the	1
man	1
had	1
something	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
his	1
mad	1
adventure.	1
For	1
the	1
man	1
remained	1
more	1
still	1
than	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
natural	1
if	1
a	1
stranger	1
had	1
come	1
so	1
close.	1
He	1
was	1
as	1
motionless	1
as	1
a	1
wax-work,	1
and	1
got	1
on	1
the	1
nerves	1
somewhat	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way.	1
Syme	1
looked	1
again	1
and	1
again	1
at	1
the	1
pale,	1
dignified	1
and	1
delicate	1
face,	1
and	1
the	1
face	1
still	1
looked	1
blankly	1
across	1
the	1
river.	1
Then	1
he	1
took	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
pocket	1
the	1
note	1
from	1
Buttons	1
proving	1
his	1
election,	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
before	1
that	1
sad	1
and	1
beautiful	1
face.	1
Then	1
the	1
man	1
smiled,	1
and	1
his	1
smile	1
was	1
a	1
shock,	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
on	1
one	1
side,	1
going	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
right	1
cheek	1
and	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
left.	1
There	1
was	1
nothing,	1
rationally	1
speaking,	1
to	1
scare	1
anyone	1
about	1
this.	1
Many	1
people	1
have	1
this	1
nervous	1
trick	1
of	1
a	1
crooked	1
smile,	1
and	1
in	1
many	1
it	1
is	1
even	1
attractive.	1
But	1
in	1
all	1
Syme's	1
circumstances,	1
with	1
the	1
dark	1
dawn	1
and	1
the	1
deadly	1
errand	1
and	1
the	1
loneliness	1
on	1
the	1
great	1
dripping	1
stones,	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
unnerving	1
in	1
it.	1
There	1
was	1
the	1
silent	1
river	1
and	1
the	1
silent	1
man,	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
even	1
classic	1
face.	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
the	1
last	1
nightmare	1
touch	1
that	1
his	1
smile	1
suddenly	1
went	1
wrong.	1
The	1
spasm	1
of	1
smile	1
was	1
instantaneous,	1
and	1
the	1
man's	1
face	1
dropped	1
at	1
once	1
into	1
its	1
harmonious	1
melancholy.	1
He	1
spoke	1
without	1
further	1
explanation	1
or	1
inquiry,	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
speaking	1
to	1
an	1
old	1
colleague.	1
"If	1
we	1
walk	1
up	1
towards	1
Leicester	1
Square,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"we	1
shall	1
just	1
be	1
in	1
time	1
for	1
breakfast.	1
Sunday	1
always	1
insists	1
on	1
an	1
early	1
breakfast.	1
Have	1
you	1
had	1
any	1
sleep?"	1
"No,"	1
said	1
Syme.	1
"Nor	1
have	1
I,"	1
answered	1
the	1
man	1
in	1
an	1
ordinary	1
tone.	1
"I	1
shall	1
try	1
to	1
get	1
to	1
bed	1
after	1
breakfast."	1
He	1
spoke	1
with	1
casual	1
civility,	1
but	1
in	1
an	1
utterly	1
dead	1
voice	1
that	1
contradicted	1
the	1
fanaticism	1
of	1
his	1
face.	1
It	1
seemed	1
almost	1
as	1
if	1
all	1
friendly	1
words	1
were	1
to	1
him	1
lifeless	1
conveniences,	1
and	1
that	1
his	1
only	1
life	1
was	1
hate.	1
After	1
a	1
pause	1
the	1
man	1
spoke	1
again.	1
"Of	1
course,	1
the	1
Secretary	1
of	1
the	1
branch	1
told	1
you	1
everything	1
that	1
can	1
be	1
told.	1
But	1
the	1
one	1
thing	1
that	1
can	1
never	1
be	1
told	1
is	1
the	1
last	1
notion	1
of	1
the	1
President,	1
for	1
his	1
notions	1
grow	1
like	1
a	1
tropical	1
forest.	1
So	1
in	1
case	1
you	1
don't	1
know,	1
I'd	1
better	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
carrying	1
out	1
his	1
notion	1
of	1
concealing	1
ourselves	1
by	1
not	1
concealing	1
ourselves	1
to	1
the	1
most	1
extraordinary	1
lengths	1
just	1
now.	1
Originally,	1
of	1
course,	1
we	1
met	1
in	1
a	1
cell	1
underground,	1
just	1
as	1
your	1
branch	1
does.	1
Then	1
Sunday	1
made	1
us	1
take	1
a	1
private	1
room	1
at	1
an	1
ordinary	1
restaurant.	1
He	1
said	1
that	1
if	1
you	1
didn't	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
hiding	1
nobody	1
hunted	1
you	1
out.	1
Well,	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
only	1
man	1
on	1
earth,	1
I	1
know;	1
but	1
sometimes	1
I	1
really	1
think	1
that	1
his	1
huge	1
brain	1
is	1
going	1
a	1
little	1
mad	1
in	1
its	1
old	1
age.	1
For	1
now	1
we	1
flaunt	1
ourselves	1
before	1
the	1
public.	1
We	1
have	1
our	1
breakfast	1
on	1
a	1
balcony--on	1
a	1
balcony,	1
if	1
you	1
please--overlooking	1
Leicester	1
Square."	1
"And	1
what	1
do	1
the	1
people	1
say?"	1
asked	1
Syme.	1
"It's	1
quite	1
simple	1
what	1
they	1
say,"	1
answered	1
his	1
guide.	1
"They	1
say	1
we	1
are	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
jolly	1
gentlemen	1
who	1
pretend	1
they	1
are	1
anarchists."	1
"It	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
a	1
very	1
clever	1
idea,"	1
said	1
Syme.	1
"Clever!	1
God	1
blast	1
your	1
impudence!	1
Clever!"	1
cried	1
out	1
the	1
other	1
in	1
a	1
sudden,	1
shrill	1
voice	1
which	1
was	1
as	1
startling	1
and	1
discordant	1
as	1
his	1
crooked	1
smile.	1
"When	1
you've	1
seen	1
Sunday	1
for	1
a	1
split	1
second	1
you'll	1
leave	1
off	1
calling	1
him	1
clever."	1
With	1
this	1
they	1
emerged	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
narrow	1
street,	1
and	1
saw	1
the	1
early	1
sunlight	1
filling	1
Leicester	1
Square.	1
It	1
will	1
never	1
be	1
known,	1
I	1
suppose,	1
why	1
this	1
square	1
itself	1
should	1
look	1
so	1
alien	1
and	1
in	1
some	1
ways	1
so	1
continental.	1
It	1
will	1
never	1
be	1
known	1
whether	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
foreign	1
look	1
that	1
attracted	1
the	1
foreigners	1
or	1
the	1
foreigners	1
who	1
gave	1
it	1
the	1
foreign	1
look.	1
But	1
on	1
this	1
particular	1
morning	1
the	1
effect	1
seemed	1
singularly	1
bright	1
and	1
clear.	1
Between	1
the	1
open	1
square	1
and	1
the	1
sunlit	1
leaves	1
and	1
the	1
statue	1
and	1
the	1
Saracenic	1
outlines	1
of	1
the	1
Alhambra,	1
it	1
looked	1
the	1
replica	1
of	1
some	1
French	1
or	1
even	1
Spanish	1
public	1
place.	1
And	1
this	1
effect	1
increased	1
in	1
Syme	1
the	1
sensation,	1
which	1
in	1
many	1
shapes	1
he	1
had	1
had	1
through	1
the	1
whole	1
adventure,	1
the	1
eerie	1
sensation	1
of	1
having	1
strayed	1
into	1
a	1
new	1
world.	1
As	1
a	1
fact,	1
he	1
had	1
bought	1
bad	1
cigars	1
round	1
Leicester	1
Square	1
ever	1
since	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
boy.	1
But	1
as	1
he	1
turned	1
that	1
corner,	1
and	1
saw	1
the	1
trees	1
and	1
the	1
Moorish	1
cupolas,	1
he	1
could	1
have	1
sworn	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
turning	1
into	1
an	1
unknown	1
Place	1
de	1
something	1
or	1
other	1
in	1
some	1
foreign	1
town.	1
At	1
one	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
square	1
there	1
projected	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
angle	1
of	1
a	1
prosperous	1
but	1
quiet	1
hotel,	1
the	1
bulk	1
of	1
which	1
belonged	1
to	1
a	1
street	1
behind.	1
In	1
the	1
wall	1
there	1
was	1
one	1
large	1
French	1
window,	1
probably	1
the	1
window	1
of	1
a	1
large	1
coffee-room;	1
and	1
outside	1
this	1
window,	1
almost	1
literally	1
overhanging	1
the	1
square,	1
was	1
a	1
formidably	1
buttressed	1
balcony,	1
big	1
enough	1
to	1
contain	1
a	1
dining-table.	1
In	1
fact,	1
it	1
did	1
contain	1
a	1
dining-table,	1
or	1
more	1
strictly	1
a	1
breakfast-table;	1
and	1
round	1
the	1
breakfast-table,	1
glowing	1
in	1
the	1
sunlight	1
and	1
evident	1
to	1
the	1
street,	1
were	1
a	1
group	1
of	1
noisy	1
and	1
talkative	1
men,	1
all	1
dressed	1
in	1
the	1
insolence	1
of	1
fashion,	1
with	1
white	1
waistcoats	1
and	1
expensive	1
button-holes.	1
Some	1
of	1
their	1
jokes	1
could	1
almost	1
be	1
heard	1
across	1
the	1
square.	1
Then	1
the	1
grave	1
Secretary	1
gave	1
his	1
unnatural	1
smile,	1
and	1
Syme	1
knew	1
that	1
this	1
boisterous	1
breakfast	1
party	1
was	1
the	1
secret	1
conclave	1
of	1
the	1
European	1
Dynamiters.	1
Then,	1
as	1
Syme	1
continued	1
to	1
stare	1
at	1
them,	1
he	1
saw	1
something	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
before.	1
He	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
it	1
literally	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
too	1
large	1
to	1
see.	1
At	1
the	1
nearest	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
balcony,	1
blocking	1
up	1
a	1
great	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
perspective,	1
was	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
mountain	1
of	1
a	1
man.	1
When	1
Syme	1
had	1
seen	1
him,	1
his	1
first	1
thought	1
was	1
that	1
the	1
weight	1
of	1
him	1
must	1
break	1
down	1
the	1
balcony	1
of	1
stone.	1
His	1
vastness	1
did	1
not	1
lie	1
only	1
in	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
abnormally	1
tall	1
and	1
quite	1
incredibly	1
fat.	1
This	1
man	1
was	1
planned	1
enormously	1
in	1
his	1
original	1
proportions,	1
like	1
a	1
statue	1
carved	1
deliberately	1
as	1
colossal.	1
His	1
head,	1
crowned	1
with	1
white	1
hair,	1
as	1
seen	1
from	1
behind	1
looked	1
bigger	1
than	1
a	1
head	1
ought	1
to	1
be.	1
The	1
ears	1
that	1
stood	1
out	1
from	1
it	1
looked	1
larger	1
than	1
human	1
ears.	1
He	1
was	1
enlarged	1
terribly	1
to	1
scale;	1
and	1
this	1
sense	1
of	1
size	1
was	1
so	1
staggering,	1
that	1
when	1
Syme	1
saw	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
other	1
figures	1
seemed	1
quite	1
suddenly	1
to	1
dwindle	1
and	1
become	1
dwarfish.	1
They	1
were	1
still	1
sitting	1
there	1
as	1
before	1
with	1
their	1
flowers	1
and	1
frock-coats,	1
but	1
now	1
it	1
looked	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
big	1
man	1
was	1
entertaining	1
five	1
children	1
to	1
tea.	1
As	1
Syme	1
and	1
the	1
guide	1
approached	1
the	1
side	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
hotel,	1
a	1
waiter	1
came	1
out	1
smiling	1
with	1
every	1
tooth	1
in	1
his	1
head.	1
"The	1
gentlemen	1
are	1
up	1
there,	1
sare,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"They	1
do	1
talk	1
and	1
they	1
do	1
laugh	1
at	1
what	1
they	1
talk.	1
They	1
do	1
say	1
they	1
will	1
throw	1
bombs	1
at	1
ze	1
king."	1
And	1
the	1
waiter	1
hurried	1
away	1
with	1
a	1
napkin	1
over	1
his	1
arm,	1
much	1
pleased	1
with	1
the	1
singular	1
frivolity	1
of	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
upstairs.	1
The	1
two	1
men	1
mounted	1
the	1
stairs	1
in	1
silence.	1
Syme	1
had	1
never	1
thought	1
of	1
asking	1
whether	1
the	1
monstrous	1
man	1
who	1
almost	1
filled	1
and	1
broke	1
the	1
balcony	1
was	1
the	1
great	1
President	1
of	1
whom	1
the	1
others	1
stood	1
in	1
awe.	1
He	1
knew	1
it	1
was	1
so,	1
with	1
an	1
unaccountable	1
but	1
instantaneous	1
certainty.	1
Syme,	1
indeed,	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
men	1
who	1
are	1
open	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
more	1
nameless	1
psychological	1
influences	1
in	1
a	1
degree	1
a	1
little	1
dangerous	1
to	1
mental	1
health.	1
Utterly	1
devoid	1
of	1
fear	1
in	1
physical	1
dangers,	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
too	1
sensitive	1
to	1
the	1
smell	1
of	1
spiritual	1
evil.	1
Twice	1
already	1
that	1
night	1
little	1
unmeaning	1
things	1
had	1
peeped	1
out	1
at	1
him	1
almost	1
pruriently,	1
and	1
given	1
him	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
drawing	1
nearer	1
and	1
nearer	1
to	1
the	1
head-quarters	1
of	1
hell.	1
And	1
this	1
sense	1
became	1
overpowering	1
as	1
he	1
drew	1
nearer	1
to	1
the	1
great	1
President.	1
The	1
form	1
it	1
took	1
was	1
a	1
childish	1
and	1
yet	1
hateful	1
fancy.	1
As	1
he	1
walked	1
across	1
the	1
inner	1
room	1
towards	1
the	1
balcony,	1
the	1
large	1
face	1
of	1
Sunday	1
grew	1
larger	1
and	1
larger;	1
and	1
Syme	1
was	1
gripped	1
with	1
a	1
fear	1
that	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
quite	1
close	1
the	1
face	1
would	1
be	1
too	1
big	1
to	1
be	1
possible,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
scream	1
aloud.	1
He	1
remembered	1
that	1
as	1
a	1
child	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
mask	1
of	1
Memnon	1
in	1
the	1
British	1
Museum,	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
face,	1
and	1
so	1
large.	1
By	1
an	1
effort,	1
braver	1
than	1
that	1
of	1
leaping	1
over	1
a	1
cliff,	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
an	1
empty	1
seat	1
at	1
the	1
breakfast-table	1
and	1
sat	1
down.	1
The	1
men	1
greeted	1
him	1
with	1
good-humoured	1
raillery	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
always	1
known	1
him.	1
He	1
sobered	1
himself	1
a	1
little	1
by	1
looking	1
at	1
their	1
conventional	1
coats	1
and	1
solid,	1
shining	1
coffee-pot;	1
then	1
he	1
looked	1
again	1
at	1
Sunday.	1
His	1
face	1
was	1
very	1
large,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
still	1
possible	1
to	1
humanity.	1
In	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
President	1
the	1
whole	1
company	1
looked	1
sufficiently	1
commonplace;	1
nothing	1
about	1
them	1
caught	1
the	1
eye	1
at	1
first,	1
except	1
that	1
by	1
the	1
President's	1
caprice	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
dressed	1
up	1
with	1
a	1
festive	1
respectability,	1
which	1
gave	1
the	1
meal	1
the	1
look	1
of	1
a	1
wedding	1
breakfast.	1
One	1
man	1
indeed	1
stood	1
out	1
at	1
even	1
a	1
superficial	1
glance.	1
He	1
at	1
least	1
was	1
the	1
common	1
or	1
garden	1
Dynamiter.	1
He	1
wore,	1
indeed,	1
the	1
high	1
white	1
collar	1
and	1
satin	1
tie	1
that	1
were	1
the	1
uniform	1
of	1
the	1
occasion;	1
but	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
collar	1
there	1
sprang	1
a	1
head	1
quite	1
unmanageable	1
and	1
quite	1
unmistakable,	1
a	1
bewildering	1
bush	1
of	1
brown	1
hair	1
and	1
beard	1
that	1
almost	1
obscured	1
the	1
eyes	1
like	1
those	1
of	1
a	1
Skye	1
terrier.	1
But	1
the	1
eyes	1
did	1
look	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
tangle,	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
the	1
sad	1
eyes	1
of	1
some	1
Russian	1
serf.	1
The	1
effect	1
of	1
this	1
figure	1
was	1
not	1
terrible	1
like	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
President,	1
but	1
it	1
had	1
every	1
diablerie	1
that	1
can	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
utterly	1
grotesque.	1
If	1
out	1
of	1
that	1
stiff	1
tie	1
and	1
collar	1
there	1
had	1
come	1
abruptly	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
a	1
cat	1
or	1
a	1
dog,	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
more	1
idiotic	1
contrast.	1
The	1
man's	1
name,	1
it	1
seemed,	1
was	1
Gogol;	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
Pole,	1
and	1
in	1
this	1
circle	1
of	1
days	1
he	1
was	1
called	1
Tuesday.	1
His	1
soul	1
and	1
speech	1
were	1
incurably	1
tragic;	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
force	1
himself	1
to	1
play	1
the	1
prosperous	1
and	1
frivolous	1
part	1
demanded	1
of	1
him	1
by	1
President	1
Sunday.	1
And,	1
indeed,	1
when	1
Syme	1
came	1
in	1
the	1
President,	1
with	1
that	1
daring	1
disregard	1
of	1
public	1
suspicion	1
which	1
was	1
his	1
policy,	1
was	1
actually	1
chaffing	1
Gogol	1
upon	1
his	1
inability	1
to	1
assume	1
conventional	1
graces.	1
"Our	1
friend	1
Tuesday,"	1
said	1
the	1
President	1
in	1
a	1
deep	1
voice	1
at	1
once	1
of	1
quietude	1
and	1
volume,	1
"our	1
friend	1
Tuesday	1
doesn't	1
seem	1
to	1
grasp	1
the	1
idea.	1
He	1
dresses	1
up	1
like	1
a	1
gentleman,	1
but	1
he	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
too	1
great	1
a	1
soul	1
to	1
behave	1
like	1
one.	1
He	1
insists	1
on	1
the	1
ways	1
of	1
the	1
stage	1
conspirator.	1
Now	1
if	1
a	1
gentleman	1
goes	1
about	1
London	1
in	1
a	1
top	1
hat	1
and	1
a	1
frock-coat,	1
no	1
one	1
need	1
know	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
an	1
anarchist.	1
But	1
if	1
a	1
gentleman	1
puts	1
on	1
a	1
top	1
hat	1
and	1
a	1
frock-coat,	1
and	1
then	1
goes	1
about	1
on	1
his	1
hands	1
and	1
knees--well,	1
he	1
may	1
attract	1
attention.	1
That's	1
what	1
Brother	1
Gogol	1
does.	1
He	1
goes	1
about	1
on	1
his	1
hands	1
and	1
knees	1
with	1
such	1
inexhaustible	1
diplomacy,	1
that	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
he	1
finds	1
it	1
quite	1
difficult	1
to	1
walk	1
upright."	1
"I	1
am	1
not	1
good	1
at	1
goncealment,"	1
said	1
Gogol	1
sulkily,	1
with	1
a	1
thick	1
foreign	1
accent;	1
"I	1
am	1
not	1
ashamed	1
of	1
the	1
cause."	1
"Yes	1
you	1
are,	1
my	1
boy,	1
and	1
so	1
is	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
you,"	1
said	1
the	1
President	1
good-naturedly.	1
"You	1
hide	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
anybody;	1
but	1
you	1
can't	1
do	1
it,	1
you	1
see,	1
you're	1
such	1
an	1
ass!	1
You	1
try	1
to	1
combine	1
two	1
inconsistent	1
methods.	1
When	1
a	1
householder	1
finds	1
a	1
man	1
under	1
his	1
bed,	1
he	1
will	1
probably	1
pause	1
to	1
note	1
the	1
circumstance.	1
But	1
if	1
he	1
finds	1
a	1
man	1
under	1
his	1
bed	1
in	1
a	1
top	1
hat,	1
you	1
will	1
agree	1
with	1
me,	1
my	1
dear	1
Tuesday,	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
likely	1
even	1
to	1
forget	1
it.	1
Now	1
when	1
you	1
were	1
found	1
under	1
Admiral	1
Biffin's	1
bed--"	1
"I	1
am	1
not	1
good	1
at	1
deception,"	1
said	1
Tuesday	1
gloomily,	1
flushing.	1
"Right,	1
my	1
boy,	1
right,"	1
said	1
the	1
President	1
with	1
a	1
ponderous	1
heartiness,	1
"you	1
aren't	1
good	1
at	1
anything."	1
While	1
this	1
stream	1
of	1
conversation	1
continued,	1
Syme	1
was	1
looking	1
more	1
steadily	1
at	1
the	1
men	1
around	1
him.	1
As	1
he	1
did	1
so,	1
he	1
gradually	1
felt	1
all	1
his	1
sense	1
of	1
something	1
spiritually	1
queer	1
return.	1
He	1
had	1
thought	1
at	1
first	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
of	1
common	1
stature	1
and	1
costume,	1
with	1
the	1
evident	1
exception	1
of	1
the	1
hairy	1
Gogol.	1
But	1
as	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
others,	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
see	1
in	1
each	1
of	1
them	1
exactly	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
in	1
the	1
man	1
by	1
the	1
river,	1
a	1
demoniac	1
detail	1
somewhere.	1
That	1
lop-sided	1
laugh,	1
which	1
would	1
suddenly	1
disfigure	1
the	1
fine	1
face	1
of	1
his	1
original	1
guide,	1
was	1
typical	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
types.	1
Each	1
man	1
had	1
something	1
about	1
him,	1
perceived	1
perhaps	1
at	1
the	1
tenth	1
or	1
twentieth	1
glance,	1
which	1
was	1
not	1
normal,	1
and	1
which	1
seemed	1
hardly	1
human.	1
The	1
only	1
metaphor	1
he	1
could	1
think	1
of	1
was	1
this,	1
that	1
they	1
all	1
looked	1
as	1
men	1
of	1
fashion	1
and	1
presence	1
would	1
look,	1
with	1
the	1
additional	1
twist	1
given	1
in	1
a	1
false	1
and	1
curved	1
mirror.	1
Only	1
the	1
individual	1
examples	1
will	1
express	1
this	1
half-concealed	1
eccentricity.	1
Syme's	1
original	1
cicerone	1
bore	1
the	1
title	1
of	1
Monday;	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
Secretary	1
of	1
the	1
Council,	1
and	1
his	1
twisted	1
smile	1
was	1
regarded	1
with	1
more	1
terror	1
than	1
anything,	1
except	1
the	1
President's	1
horrible,	1
happy	1
laughter.	1
But	1
now	1
that	1
Syme	1
had	1
more	1
space	1
and	1
light	1
to	1
observe	1
him,	1
there	1
were	1
other	1
touches.	1
His	1
fine	1
face	1
was	1
so	1
emaciated,	1
that	1
Syme	1
thought	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
wasted	1
with	1
some	1
disease;	1
yet	1
somehow	1
the	1
very	1
distress	1
of	1
his	1
dark	1
eyes	1
denied	1
this.	1
It	1
was	1
no	1
physical	1
ill	1
that	1
troubled	1
him.	1
His	1
eyes	1
were	1
alive	1
with	1
intellectual	1
torture,	1
as	1
if	1
pure	1
thought	1
was	1
pain.	1
He	1
was	1
typical	1
of	1
each	1
of	1
the	1
tribe;	1
each	1
man	1
was	1
subtly	1
and	1
differently	1
wrong.	1
Next	1
to	1
him	1
sat	1
Tuesday,	1
the	1
tousle-headed	1
Gogol,	1
a	1
man	1
more	1
obviously	1
mad.	1
Next	1
was	1
Wednesday,	1
a	1
certain	1
Marquis	1
de	1
St.	1
Eustache,	1
a	1
sufficiently	1
characteristic	1
figure.	1
The	1
first	1
few	1
glances	1
found	1
nothing	1
unusual	1
about	1
him,	1
except	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
man	1
at	1
table	1
who	1
wore	1
the	1
fashionable	1
clothes	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
really	1
his	1
own.	1
He	1
had	1
a	1
black	1
French	1
beard	1
cut	1
square	1
and	1
a	1
black	1
English	1
frock-coat	1
cut	1
even	1
squarer.	1
But	1
Syme,	1
sensitive	1
to	1
such	1
things,	1
felt	1
somehow	1
that	1
the	1
man	1
carried	1
a	1
rich	1
atmosphere	1
with	1
him,	1
a	1
rich	1
atmosphere	1
that	1
suffocated.	1
It	1
reminded	1
one	1
irrationally	1
of	1
drowsy	1
odours	1
and	1
of	1
dying	1
lamps	1
in	1
the	1
darker	1
poems	1
of	1
Byron	1
and	1
Poe.	1
With	1
this	1
went	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
his	1
being	1
clad,	1
not	1
in	1
lighter	1
colours,	1
but	1
in	1
softer	1
materials;	1
his	1
black	1
seemed	1
richer	1
and	1
warmer	1
than	1
the	1
black	1
shades	1
about	1
him,	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
compounded	1
of	1
profound	1
colour.	1
His	1
black	1
coat	1
looked	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
only	1
black	1
by	1
being	1
too	1
dense	1
a	1
purple.	1
His	1
black	1
beard	1
looked	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
only	1
black	1
by	1
being	1
too	1
deep	1
a	1
blue.	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
gloom	1
and	1
thickness	1
of	1
the	1
beard	1
his	1
dark	1
red	1
mouth	1
showed	1
sensual	1
and	1
scornful.	1
Whatever	1
he	1
was	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
Frenchman;	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
a	1
Jew;	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
something	1
deeper	1
yet	1
in	1
the	1
dark	1
heart	1
of	1
the	1
East.	1
In	1
the	1
bright	1
coloured	1
Persian	1
tiles	1
and	1
pictures	1
showing	1
tyrants	1
hunting,	1
you	1
may	1
see	1
just	1
those	1
almond	1
eyes,	1
those	1
blue-black	1
beards,	1
those	1
cruel,	1
crimson	1
lips.	1
Then	1
came	1
Syme,	1
and	1
next	1
a	1
very	1
old	1
man,	1
Professor	1
de	1
Worms,	1
who	1
still	1
kept	1
the	1
chair	1
of	1
Friday,	1
though	1
every	1
day	1
it	1
was	1
expected	1
that	1
his	1
death	1
would	1
leave	1
it	1
empty.	1
Save	1
for	1
his	1
intellect,	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
dissolution	1
of	1
senile	1
decay.	1
His	1
face	1
was	1
as	1
grey	1
as	1
his	1
long	1
grey	1
beard,	1
his	1
forehead	1
was	1
lifted	1
and	1
fixed	1
finally	1
in	1
a	1
furrow	1
of	1
mild	1
despair.	1
In	1
no	1
other	1
case,	1
not	1
even	1
that	1
of	1
Gogol,	1
did	1
the	1
bridegroom	1
brilliancy	1
of	1
the	1
morning	1
dress	1
express	1
a	1
more	1
painful	1
contrast.	1
For	1
the	1
red	1
flower	1
in	1
his	1
button-hole	1
showed	1
up	1
against	1
a	1
face	1
that	1
was	1
literally	1
discoloured	1
like	1
lead;	1
the	1
whole	1
hideous	1
effect	1
was	1
as	1
if	1
some	1
drunken	1
dandies	1
had	1
put	1
their	1
clothes	1
upon	1
a	1
corpse.	1
When	1
he	1
rose	1
or	1
sat	1
down,	1
which	1
was	1
with	1
long	1
labour	1
and	1
peril,	1
something	1
worse	1
was	1
expressed	1
than	1
mere	1
weakness,	1
something	1
indefinably	1
connected	1
with	1
the	1
horror	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
scene.	1
It	1
did	1
not	1
express	1
decrepitude	1
merely,	1
but	1
corruption.	1
Another	1
hateful	1
fancy	1
crossed	1
Syme's	1
quivering	1
mind.	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
thinking	1
that	1
whenever	1
the	1
man	1
moved	1
a	1
leg	1
or	1
arm	1
might	1
fall	1
off.	1
Right	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
sat	1
the	1
man	1
called	1
Saturday,	1
the	1
simplest	1
and	1
the	1
most	1
baffling	1
of	1
all.	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
short,	1
square	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
dark,	1
square	1
face	1
clean-shaven,	1
a	1
medical	1
practitioner	1
going	1
by	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Bull.	1
He	1
had	1
that	1
combination	1
of	1
savoir-faire	1
with	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
well-groomed	1
coarseness	1
which	1
is	1
not	1
uncommon	1
in	1
young	1
doctors.	1
He	1
carried	1
his	1
fine	1
clothes	1
with	1
confidence	1
rather	1
than	1
ease,	1
and	1
he	1
mostly	1
wore	1
a	1
set	1
smile.	1
There	1
was	1
nothing	1
whatever	1
odd	1
about	1
him,	1
except	1
that	1
he	1
wore	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
dark,	1
almost	1
opaque	1
spectacles.	1
It	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
merely	1
a	1
crescendo	1
of	1
nervous	1
fancy	1
that	1
had	1
gone	1
before,	1
but	1
those	1
black	1
discs	1
were	1
dreadful	1
to	1
Syme;	1
they	1
reminded	1
him	1
of	1
half-remembered	1
ugly	1
tales,	1
of	1
some	1
story	1
about	1
pennies	1
being	1
put	1
on	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
dead.	1
Syme's	1
eye	1
always	1
caught	1
the	1
black	1
glasses	1
and	1
the	1
blind	1
grin.	1
Had	1
the	1
dying	1
Professor	1
worn	1
them,	1
or	1
even	1
the	1
pale	1
Secretary,	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
appropriate.	1
But	1
on	1
the	1
younger	1
and	1
grosser	1
man	1
they	1
seemed	1
only	1
an	1
enigma.	1
They	1
took	1
away	1
the	1
key	1
of	1
the	1
face.	1
You	1
could	1
not	1
tell	1
what	1
his	1
smile	1
or	1
his	1
gravity	1
meant.	1
Partly	1
from	1
this,	1
and	1
partly	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
vulgar	1
virility	1
wanting	1
in	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
others	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
Syme	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
the	1
wickedest	1
of	1
all	1
those	1
wicked	1
men.	1
Syme	1
even	1
had	1
the	1
thought	1
that	1
his	1
eyes	1
might	1
be	1
covered	1
up	1
because	1
they	1
were	1
too	1
frightful	1
to	1
see.	1
CHAPTER	1
VI	1
THE	1
EXPOSURE	1
SUCH	1
were	1
the	1
six	1
men	1
who	1
had	1
sworn	1
to	1
destroy	1
the	1
world.	1
Again	1
and	1
again	1
Syme	1
strove	1
to	1
pull	1
together	1
his	1
common	1
sense	1
in	1
their	1
presence.	1
Sometimes	1
he	1
saw	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
that	1
these	1
notions	1
were	1
subjective,	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
only	1
looking	1
at	1
ordinary	1
men,	1
one	1
of	1
whom	1
was	1
old,	1
another	1
nervous,	1
another	1
short-sighted.	1
The	1
sense	1
of	1
an	1
unnatural	1
symbolism	1
always	1
settled	1
back	1
on	1
him	1
again.	1
Each	1
figure	1
seemed	1
to	1
be,	1
somehow,	1
on	1
the	1
borderland	1
of	1
things,	1
just	1
as	1
their	1
theory	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
borderland	1
of	1
thought.	1
He	1
knew	1
that	1
each	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
men	1
stood	1
at	1
the	1
extreme	1
end,	1
so	1
to	1
speak,	1
of	1
some	1
wild	1
road	1
of	1
reasoning.	1
He	1
could	1
only	1
fancy,	1
as	1
in	1
some	1
old-world	1
fable,	1
that	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
went	1
westward	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
he	1
would	1
find	1
something--say	1
a	1
tree--that	1
was	1
more	1
or	1
less	1
than	1
a	1
tree,	1
a	1
tree	1
possessed	1
by	1
a	1
spirit;	1
and	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
went	1
east	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
he	1
would	1
find	1
something	1
else	1
that	1
was	1
not	1
wholly	1
itself--a	1
tower,	1
perhaps,	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
very	1
shape	1
was	1
wicked.	1
So	1
these	1
figures	1
seemed	1
to	1
stand	1
up,	1
violent	1
and	1
unaccountable,	1
against	1
an	1
ultimate	1
horizon,	1
visions	1
from	1
the	1
verge.	1
The	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
were	1
closing	1
in.	1
Talk	1
had	1
been	1
going	1
on	1
steadily	1
as	1
he	1
took	1
in	1
the	1
scene;	1
and	1
not	1
the	1
least	1
of	1
the	1
contrasts	1
of	1
that	1
bewildering	1
breakfast-table	1
was	1
the	1
contrast	1
between	1
the	1
easy	1
and	1
unobtrusive	1
tone	1
of	1
talk	1
and	1
its	1
terrible	1
purport.	1
They	1
were	1
deep	1
in	1
the	1
discussion	1
of	1
an	1
actual	1
and	1
immediate	1
plot.	1
The	1
waiter	1
downstairs	1
had	1
spoken	1
quite	1
correctly	1
when	1
he	1
said	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
talking	1
about	1
bombs	1
and	1
kings.	1
Only	1
three	1
days	1
afterwards	1
the	1
Czar	1
was	1
to	1
meet	1
the	1
President	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
Republic	1
in	1
Paris,	1
and	1
over	1
their	1
bacon	1
and	1
eggs	1
upon	1
their	1
sunny	1
balcony	1
these	1
beaming	1
gentlemen	1
had	1
decided	1
how	1
both	1
should	1
die.	1
Even	1
the	1
instrument	1
was	1
chosen;	1
the	1
black-bearded	1
Marquis,	1
it	1
appeared,	1
was	1
to	1
carry	1
the	1
bomb.	1
Ordinarily	1
speaking,	1
the	1
proximity	1
of	1
this	1
positive	1
and	1
objective	1
crime	1
would	1
have	1
sobered	1
Syme,	1
and	1
cured	1
him	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
merely	1
mystical	1
tremors.	1
He	1
would	1
have	1
thought	1
of	1
nothing	1
but	1
the	1
need	1
of	1
saving	1
at	1
least	1
two	1
human	1
bodies	1
from	1
being	1
ripped	1
in	1
pieces	1
with	1
iron	1
and	1
roaring	1
gas.	1
But	1
the	1
truth	1
was	1
that	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
he	1
had	1
begun	1
to	1
feel	1
a	1
third	1
kind	1
of	1
fear,	1
more	1
piercing	1
and	1
practical	1
than	1
either	1
his	1
moral	1
revulsion	1
or	1
his	1
social	1
responsibility.	1
Very	1
simply,	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
fear	1
to	1
spare	1
for	1
the	1
French	1
President	1
or	1
the	1
Czar;	1
he	1
had	1
begun	1
to	1
fear	1
for	1
himself.	1
Most	1
of	1
the	1
talkers	1
took	1
little	1
heed	1
of	1
him,	1
debating	1
now	1
with	1
their	1
faces	1
closer	1
together,	1
and	1
almost	1
uniformly	1
grave,	1
save	1
when	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
the	1
smile	1
of	1
the	1
Secretary	1
ran	1
aslant	1
across	1
his	1
face	1
as	1
the	1
jagged	1
lightning	1
runs	1
aslant	1
across	1
the	1
sky.	1
But	1
there	1
was	1
one	1
persistent	1
thing	1
which	1
first	1
troubled	1
Syme	1
and	1
at	1
last	1
terrified	1
him.	1
The	1
President	1
was	1
always	1
looking	1
at	1
him,	1
steadily,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
and	1
baffling	1
interest.	1
The	1
enormous	1
man	1
was	1
quite	1
quiet,	1
but	1
his	1
blue	1
eyes	1
stood	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
head.	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
always	1
fixed	1
on	1
Syme.	1
Syme	1
felt	1
moved	1
to	1
spring	1
up	1
and	1
leap	1
over	1
the	1
balcony.	1
When	1
the	1
President's	1
eyes	1
were	1
on	1
him	1
he	1
felt	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
made	1
of	1
glass.	1
He	1
had	1
hardly	1
the	1
shred	1
of	1
a	1
doubt	1
that	1
in	1
some	1
silent	1
and	1
extraordinary	1
way	1
Sunday	1
had	1
found	1
out	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
spy.	1
He	1
looked	1
over	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
balcony,	1
and	1
saw	1
a	1
policeman,	1
standing	1
abstractedly	1
just	1
beneath,	1
staring	1
at	1
the	1
bright	1
railings	1
and	1
the	1
sunlit	1
trees.	1
Then	1
there	1
fell	1
upon	1
him	1
the	1
great	1
temptation	1
that	1
was	1
to	1
torment	1
him	1
for	1
many	1
days.	1
In	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
these	1
powerful	1
and	1
repulsive	1
men,	1
who	1
were	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
anarchy,	1
he	1
had	1
almost	1
forgotten	1
the	1
frail	1
and	1
fanciful	1
figure	1
of	1
the	1
poet	1
Gregory,	1
the	1
mere	1
aesthete	1
of	1
anarchism.	1
He	1
even	1
thought	1
of	1
him	1
now	1
with	1
an	1
old	1
kindness,	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
played	1
together	1
when	1
children.	1
But	1
he	1
remembered	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
still	1
tied	1
to	1
Gregory	1
by	1
a	1
great	1
promise.	1
He	1
had	1
promised	1
never	1
to	1
do	1
the	1
very	1
thing	1
that	1
he	1
now	1
felt	1
himself	1
almost	1
in	1
the	1
act	1
of	1
doing.	1
He	1
had	1
promised	1
not	1
to	1
jump	1
over	1
that	1
balcony	1
and	1
speak	1
to	1
that	1
policeman.	1
He	1
took	1
his	1
cold	1
hand	1
off	1
the	1
cold	1
stone	1
balustrade.	1
His	1
soul	1
swayed	1
in	1
a	1
vertigo	1
of	1
moral	1
indecision.	1
He	1
had	1
only	1
to	1
snap	1
the	1
thread	1
of	1
a	1
rash	1
vow	1
made	1
to	1
a	1
villainous	1
society,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
life	1
could	1
be	1
as	1
open	1
and	1
sunny	1
as	1
the	1
square	1
beneath	1
him.	1
He	1
had,	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
hand,	1
only	1
to	1
keep	1
his	1
antiquated	1
honour,	1
and	1
be	1
delivered	1
inch	1
by	1
inch	1
into	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
this	1
great	1
enemy	1
of	1
mankind,	1
whose	1
very	1
intellect	1
was	1
a	1
torture-chamber.	1
Whenever	1
he	1
looked	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
square	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
comfortable	1
policeman,	1
a	1
pillar	1
of	1
common	1
sense	1
and	1
common	1
order.	1
Whenever	1
he	1
looked	1
back	1
at	1
the	1
breakfast-table	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
President	1
still	1
quietly	1
studying	1
him	1
with	1
big,	1
unbearable	1
eyes.	1
In	1
all	1
the	1
torrent	1
of	1
his	1
thought	1
there	1
were	1
two	1
thoughts	1
that	1
never	1
crossed	1
his	1
mind.	1
First,	1
it	1
never	1
occurred	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
doubt	1
that	1
the	1
President	1
and	1
his	1
Council	1
could	1
crush	1
him	1
if	1
he	1
continued	1
to	1
stand	1
alone.	1
The	1
place	1
might	1
be	1
public,	1
the	1
project	1
might	1
seem	1
impossible.	1
But	1
Sunday	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
would	1
carry	1
himself	1
thus	1
easily	1
without	1
having,	1
somehow	1
or	1
somewhere,	1
set	1
open	1
his	1
iron	1
trap.	1
Either	1
by	1
anonymous	1
poison	1
or	1
sudden	1
street	1
accident,	1
by	1
hypnotism	1
or	1
by	1
fire	1
from	1
hell,	1
Sunday	1
could	1
certainly	1
strike	1
him.	1
If	1
he	1
defied	1
the	1
man	1
he	1
was	1
probably	1
dead,	1
either	1
struck	1
stiff	1
there	1
in	1
his	1
chair	1
or	1
long	1
afterwards	1
as	1
by	1
an	1
innocent	1
ailment.	1
If	1
he	1
called	1
in	1
the	1
police	1
promptly,	1
arrested	1
everyone,	1
told	1
all,	1
and	1
set	1
against	1
them	1
the	1
whole	1
energy	1
of	1
England,	1
he	1
would	1
probably	1
escape;	1
certainly	1
not	1
otherwise.	1
They	1
were	1
a	1
balconyful	1
of	1
gentlemen	1
overlooking	1
a	1
bright	1
and	1
busy	1
square;	1
but	1
he	1
felt	1
no	1
more	1
safe	1
with	1
them	1
than	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
boatful	1
of	1
armed	1
pirates	1
overlooking	1
an	1
empty	1
sea.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
second	1
thought	1
that	1
never	1
came	1
to	1
him.	1
It	1
never	1
occurred	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
spiritually	1
won	1
over	1
to	1
the	1
enemy.	1
Many	1
moderns,	1
inured	1
to	1
a	1
weak	1
worship	1
of	1
intellect	1
and	1
force,	1
might	1
have	1
wavered	1
in	1
their	1
allegiance	1
under	1
this	1
oppression	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
personality.	1
They	1
might	1
have	1
called	1
Sunday	1
the	1
super-man.	1
If	1
any	1
such	1
creature	1
be	1
conceivable,	1
he	1
looked,	1
indeed,	1
somewhat	1
like	1
it,	1
with	1
his	1
earth-shaking	1
abstraction,	1
as	1
of	1
a	1
stone	1
statue	1
walking.	1
He	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
called	1
something	1
above	1
man,	1
with	1
his	1
large	1
plans,	1
which	1
were	1
too	1
obvious	1
to	1
be	1
detected,	1
with	1
his	1
large	1
face,	1
which	1
was	1
too	1
frank	1
to	1
be	1
understood.	1
But	1
this	1
was	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
modern	1
meanness	1
to	1
which	1
Syme	1
could	1
not	1
sink	1
even	1
in	1
his	1
extreme	1
morbidity.	1
Like	1
any	1
man,	1
he	1
was	1
coward	1
enough	1
to	1
fear	1
great	1
force;	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
quite	1
coward	1
enough	1
to	1
admire	1
it.	1
The	1
men	1
were	1
eating	1
as	1
they	1
talked,	1
and	1
even	1
in	1
this	1
they	1
were	1
typical.	1
Dr.	1
Bull	1
and	1
the	1
Marquis	1
ate	1
casually	1
and	1
conventionally	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
things	1
on	1
the	1
table--cold	1
pheasant	1
or	1
Strasbourg	1
pie.	1
But	1
the	1
Secretary	1
was	1
a	1
vegetarian,	1
and	1
he	1
spoke	1
earnestly	1
of	1
the	1
projected	1
murder	1
over	1
half	1
a	1
raw	1
tomato	1
and	1
three	1
quarters	1
of	1
a	1
glass	1
of	1
tepid	1
water.	1
The	1
old	1
Professor	1
had	1
such	1
slops	1
as	1
suggested	1
a	1
sickening	1
second	1
childhood.	1
And	1
even	1
in	1
this	1
President	1
Sunday	1
preserved	1
his	1
curious	1
predominance	1
of	1
mere	1
mass.	1
For	1
he	1
ate	1
like	1
twenty	1
men;	1
he	1
ate	1
incredibly,	1
with	1
a	1
frightful	1
freshness	1
of	1
appetite,	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
like	1
watching	1
a	1
sausage	1
factory.	1
Yet	1
continually,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
swallowed	1
a	1
dozen	1
crumpets	1
or	1
drunk	1
a	1
quart	1
of	1
coffee,	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
found	1
with	1
his	1
great	1
head	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
staring	1
at	1
Syme.	1
"I	1
have	1
often	1
wondered,"	1
said	1
the	1
Marquis,	1
taking	1
a	1
great	1
bite	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
slice	1
of	1
bread	1
and	1
jam,	1
"whether	1
it	1
wouldn't	1
be	1
better	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
do	1
it	1
with	1
a	1
knife.	1
Most	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
things	1
have	1
been	1
brought	1
off	1
with	1
a	1
knife.	1
And	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
new	1
emotion	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
knife	1
into	1
a	1
French	1
President	1
and	1
wriggle	1
it	1
round."	1
"You	1
are	1
wrong,"	1
said	1
the	1
Secretary,	1
drawing	1
his	1
black	1
brows	1
together.	1
"The	1
knife	1
was	1
merely	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
personal	1
quarrel	1
with	1
a	1
personal	1
tyrant.	1
Dynamite	1
is	1
not	1
only	1
our	1
best	1
tool,	1
but	1
our	1
best	1
symbol.	1
It	1
is	1
as	1
perfect	1
a	1
symbol	1
of	1
us	1
as	1
is	1
incense	1
of	1
the	1
prayers	1
of	1
the	1
Christians.	1
It	1
expands;	1
it	1
only	1
destroys	1
because	1
it	1
broadens;	1
even	1
so,	1
thought	1
only	1
destroys	1
because	1
it	1
broadens.	1
A	1
man's	1
brain	1
is	1
a	1
bomb,"	1
he	1
cried	1
out,	1
loosening	1
suddenly	1
his	1
strange	1
passion	1
and	1
striking	1
his	1
own	1
skull	1
with	1
violence.	1
"My	1
brain	1
feels	1
like	1
a	1
bomb,	1
night	1
and	1
day.	1
It	1
must	1
expand!	1
It	1
must	1
expand!	1
A	1
man's	1
brain	1
must	1
expand,	1
if	1
it	1
breaks	1
up	1
the	1
universe."	1
"I	1
don't	1
want	1
the	1
universe	1
broken	1
up	1
just	1
yet,"	1
drawled	1
the	1
Marquis.	1
"I	1
want	1
to	1
do	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
beastly	1
things	1
before	1
I	1
die.	1
I	1
thought	1
of	1
one	1
yesterday	1
in	1
bed."	1
"No,	1
if	1
the	1
only	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
thing	1
is	1
nothing,"	1
said	1
Dr.	1
Bull	1
with	1
his	1
sphinx-like	1
smile,	1
"it	1
hardly	1
seems	1
worth	1
doing."	1
The	1
old	1
Professor	1
was	1
staring	1
at	1
the	1
ceiling	1
with	1
dull	1
eyes.	1
"Every	1
man	1
knows	1
in	1
his	1
heart,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"that	1
nothing	1
is	1
worth	1
doing."	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
singular	1
silence,	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
Secretary	1
said--	1
"We	1
are	1
wandering,	1
however,	1
from	1
the	1
point.	1
The	1
only	1
question	1
is	1
how	1
Wednesday	1
is	1
to	1
strike	1
the	1
blow.	1
I	1
take	1
it	1
we	1
should	1
all	1
agree	1
with	1
the	1
original	1
notion	1
of	1
a	1
bomb.	1
As	1
to	1
the	1
actual	1
arrangements,	1
I	1
should	1
suggest	1
that	1
tomorrow	1
morning	1
he	1
should	1
go	1
first	1
of	1
all	1
to--"	1
The	1
speech	1
was	1
broken	1
off	1
short	1
under	1
a	1
vast	1
shadow.	1
President	1
Sunday	1
had	1
risen	1
to	1
his	1
feet,	1
seeming	1
to	1
fill	1
the	1
sky	1
above	1
them.	1
"Before	1
we	1
discuss	1
that,"	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
small,	1
quiet	1
voice,	1
"let	1
us	1
go	1
into	1
a	1
private	1
room.	1
I	1
have	1
something	1
vent	1
particular	1
to	1
say."	1
Syme	1
stood	1
up	1
before	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
others.	1
The	1
instant	1
of	1
choice	1
had	1
come	1
at	1
last,	1
the	1
pistol	1
was	1
at	1
his	1
head.	1
On	1
the	1
pavement	1
before	1
he	1
could	1
hear	1
the	1
policeman	1
idly	1
stir	1
and	1
stamp,	1
for	1
the	1
morning,	1
though	1
bright,	1
was	1
cold.	1
A	1
barrel-organ	1
in	1
the	1
street	1
suddenly	1
sprang	1
with	1
a	1
jerk	1
into	1
a	1
jovial	1
tune.	1
Syme	1
stood	1
up	1
taut,	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
bugle	1
before	1
the	1
battle.	1
He	1
found	1
himself	1
filled	1
with	1
a	1
supernatural	1
courage	1
that	1
came	1
from	1
nowhere.	1
That	1
jingling	1
music	1
seemed	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
vivacity,	1
the	1
vulgarity,	1
and	1
the	1
irrational	1
valour	1
of	1
the	1
poor,	1
who	1
in	1
all	1
those	1
unclean	1
streets	1
were	1
all	1
clinging	1
to	1
the	1
decencies	1
and	1
the	1
charities	1
of	1
Christendom.	1
His	1
youthful	1
prank	1
of	1
being	1
a	1
policeman	1
had	1
faded	1
from	1
his	1
mind;	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
of	1
himself	1
as	1
the	1
representative	1
of	1
the	1
corps	1
of	1
gentlemen	1
turned	1
into	1
fancy	1
constables,	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
eccentric	1
who	1
lived	1
in	1
the	1
dark	1
room.	1
But	1
he	1
did	1
feel	1
himself	1
as	1
the	1
ambassador	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
common	1
and	1
kindly	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
street,	1
who	1
every	1
day	1
marched	1
into	1
battle	1
to	1
the	1
music	1
of	1
the	1
barrel-organ.	1
And	1
this	1
high	1
pride	1
in	1
being	1
human	1
had	1
lifted	1
him	1
unaccountably	1
to	1
an	1
infinite	1
height	1
above	1
the	1
monstrous	1
men	1
around	1
him.	1
For	1
an	1
instant,	1
at	1
least,	1
he	1
looked	1
down	1
upon	1
all	1
their	1
sprawling	1
eccentricities	1
from	1
the	1
starry	1
pinnacle	1
of	1
the	1
commonplace.	1
He	1
felt	1
towards	1
them	1
all	1
that	1
unconscious	1
and	1
elementary	1
superiority	1
that	1
a	1
brave	1
man	1
feels	1
over	1
powerful	1
beasts	1
or	1
a	1
wise	1
man	1
over	1
powerful	1
errors.	1
He	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
neither	1
the	1
intellectual	1
nor	1
the	1
physical	1
strength	1
of	1
President	1
Sunday;	1
but	1
in	1
that	1
moment	1
he	1
minded	1
it	1
no	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
muscles	1
of	1
a	1
tiger	1
or	1
a	1
horn	1
on	1
his	1
nose	1
like	1
a	1
rhinoceros.	1
All	1
was	1
swallowed	1
up	1
in	1
an	1
ultimate	1
certainty	1
that	1
the	1
President	1
was	1
wrong	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
barrel-organ	1
was	1
right.	1
There	1
clanged	1
in	1
his	1
mind	1
that	1
unanswerable	1
and	1
terrible	1
truism	1
in	1
the	1
song	1
of	1
Roland--	1
"Pagens	1
ont	1
tort	1
et	1
Chretiens	1
ont	1
droit."	1
which	1
in	1
the	1
old	1
nasal	1
French	1
has	1
the	1
clang	1
and	1
groan	1
of	1
great	1
iron.	1
This	1
liberation	1
of	1
his	1
spirit	1
from	1
the	1
load	1
of	1
his	1
weakness	1
went	1
with	1
a	1
quite	1
clear	1
decision	1
to	1
embrace	1
death.	1
If	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
barrel-organ	1
could	1
keep	1
their	1
old-world	1
obligations,	1
so	1
could	1
he.	1
This	1
very	1
pride	1
in	1
keeping	1
his	1
word	1
was	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
keeping	1
it	1
to	1
miscreants.	1
It	1
was	1
his	1
last	1
triumph	1
over	1
these	1
lunatics	1
to	1
go	1
down	1
into	1
their	1
dark	1
room	1
and	1
die	1
for	1
something	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
even	1
understand.	1
The	1
barrel-organ	1
seemed	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
marching	1
tune	1
with	1
the	1
energy	1
and	1
the	1
mingled	1
noises	1
of	1
a	1
whole	1
orchestra;	1
and	1
he	1
could	1
hear	1
deep	1
and	1
rolling,	1
under	1
all	1
the	1
trumpets	1
of	1
the	1
pride	1
of	1
life,	1
the	1
drums	1
of	1
the	1
pride	1
of	1
death.	1
The	1
conspirators	1
were	1
already	1
filing	1
through	1
the	1
open	1
window	1
and	1
into	1
the	1
rooms	1
behind.	1
Syme	1
went	1
last,	1
outwardly	1
calm,	1
but	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
brain	1
and	1
body	1
throbbing	1
with	1
romantic	1
rhythm.	1
The	1
President	1
led	1
them	1
down	1
an	1
irregular	1
side	1
stair,	1
such	1
as	1
might	1
be	1
used	1
by	1
servants,	1
and	1
into	1
a	1
dim,	1
cold,	1
empty	1
room,	1
with	1
a	1
table	1
and	1
benches,	1
like	1
an	1
abandoned	1
boardroom.	1
When	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
in,	1
he	1
closed	1
and	1
locked	1
the	1
door.	1
The	1
first	1
to	1
speak	1
was	1
Gogol,	1
the	1
irreconcilable,	1
who	1
seemed	1
bursting	1
with	1
inarticulate	1
grievance.	1
"Zso!	1
Zso!"	1
he	1
cried,	1
with	1
an	1
obscure	1
excitement,	1
his	1
heavy	1
Polish	1
accent	1
becoming	1
almost	1
impenetrable.	1
"You	1
zay	1
you	1
nod	1
'ide.	1
You	1
zay	1
you	1
show	1
himselves.	1
It	1
is	1
all	1
nuzzinks.	1
Ven	1
you	1
vant	1
talk	1
importance	1
you	1
run	1
yourselves	1
in	1
a	1
dark	1
box!"	1
The	1
President	1
seemed	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
foreigner's	1
incoherent	1
satire	1
with	1
entire	1
good	1
humour.	1
"You	1
can't	1
get	1
hold	1
of	1
it	1
yet,	1
Gogol,"	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
fatherly	1
way.	1
"When	1
once	1
they	1
have	1
heard	1
us	1
talking	1
nonsense	1
on	1
that	1
balcony	1
they	1
will	1
not	1
care	1
where	1
we	1
go	1
afterwards.	1
If	1
we	1
had	1
come	1
here	1
first,	1
we	1
should	1
have	1
had	1
the	1
whole	1
staff	1
at	1
the	1
keyhole.	1
You	1
don't	1
seem	1
to	1
know	1
anything	1
about	1
mankind."	1
"I	1
die	1
for	1
zem,"	1
cried	1
the	1
Pole	1
in	1
thick	1
excitement,	1
"and	1
I	1
slay	1
zare	1
oppressors.	1
I	1
care	1
not	1
for	1
these	1
games	1
of	1
gonzealment.	1
I	1
would	1
zmite	1
ze	1
tyrant	1
in	1
ze	1
open	1
square."	1
"I	1
see,	1
I	1
see,"	1
said	1
the	1
President,	1
nodding	1
kindly	1
as	1
he	1
seated	1
himself	1
at	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
a	1
long	1
table.	1
"You	1
die	1
for	1
mankind	1
first,	1
and	1
then	1
you	1
get	1
up	1
and	1
smite	1
their	1
oppressors.	1
So	1
that's	1
all	1
right.	1
And	1
now	1
may	1
I	1
ask	1
you	1
to	1
control	1
your	1
beautiful	1
sentiments,	1
and	1
sit	1
down	1
with	1
the	1
other	1
gentlemen	1
at	1
this	1
table.	1
For	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
this	1
morning	1
something	1
intelligent	1
is	1
going	1
to	1
be	1
said."	1
Syme,	1
with	1
the	1
perturbed	1
promptitude	1
he	1
had	1
shown	1
since	1
the	1
original	1
summons,	1
sat	1
down	1
first.	1
Gogol	1
sat	1
down	1
last,	1
grumbling	1
in	1
his	1
brown	1
beard	1
about	1
gombromise.	1
No	1
one	1
except	1
Syme	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
any	1
notion	1
of	1
the	1
blow	1
that	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
fall.	1
As	1
for	1
him,	1
he	1
had	1
merely	1
the	1
feeling	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
mounting	1
the	1
scaffold	1
with	1
the	1
intention,	1
at	1
any	1
rate,	1
of	1
making	1
a	1
good	1
speech.	1
"Comrades,"	1
said	1
the	1
President,	1
suddenly	1
rising,	1
"we	1
have	1
spun	1
out	1
this	1
farce	1
long	1
enough.	1
I	1
have	1
called	1
you	1
down	1
here	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
something	1
so	1
simple	1
and	1
shocking	1
that	1
even	1
the	1
waiters	1
upstairs	1
(long	1
inured	1
to	1
our	1
levities)	1
might	1
hear	1
some	1
new	1
seriousness	1
in	1
my	1
voice.	1
Comrades,	1
we	1
were	1
discussing	1
plans	1
and	1
naming	1
places.	1
I	1
propose,	1
before	1
saying	1
anything	1
else,	1
that	1
those	1
plans	1
and	1
places	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
voted	1
by	1
this	1
meeting,	1
but	1
should	1
be	1
left	1
wholly	1
in	1
the	1
control	1
of	1
some	1
one	1
reliable	1
member.	1
I	1
suggest	1
Comrade	1
Saturday,	1
Dr.	1
Bull."	1
They	1
all	1
stared	1
at	1
him;	1
then	1
they	1
all	1
started	1
in	1
their	1
seats,	1
for	1
the	1
next	1
words,	1
though	1
not	1
loud,	1
had	1
a	1
living	1
and	1
sensational	1
emphasis.	1
Sunday	1
struck	1
the	1
table.	1
"Not	1
one	1
word	1
more	1
about	1
the	1
plans	1
and	1
places	1
must	1
be	1
said	1
at	1
this	1
meeting.	1
Not	1
one	1
tiny	1
detail	1
more	1
about	1
what	1
we	1
mean	1
to	1
do	1
must	1
be	1
mentioned	1
in	1
this	1
company."	1
Sunday	1
had	1
spent	1
his	1
life	1
in	1
astonishing	1
his	1
followers;	1
but	1
it	1
seemed	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
really	1
astonished	1
them	1
until	1
now.	1
They	1
all	1
moved	1
feverishly	1
in	1
their	1
seats,	1
except	1
Syme.	1
He	1
sat	1
stiff	1
in	1
his,	1
with	1
his	1
hand	1
in	1
his	1
pocket,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
handle	1
of	1
his	1
loaded	1
revolver.	1
When	1
the	1
attack	1
on	1
him	1
came	1
he	1
would	1
sell	1
his	1
life	1
dear.	1
He	1
would	1
find	1
out	1
at	1
least	1
if	1
the	1
President	1
was	1
mortal.	1
Sunday	1
went	1
on	1
smoothly--	1
"You	1
will	1
probably	1
understand	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
only	1
one	1
possible	1
motive	1
for	1
forbidding	1
free	1
speech	1
at	1
this	1
festival	1
of	1
freedom.	1
Strangers	1
overhearing	1
us	1
matters	1
nothing.	1
They	1
assume	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
joking.	1
But	1
what	1
would	1
matter,	1
even	1
unto	1
death,	1
is	1
this,	1
that	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
one	1
actually	1
among	1
us	1
who	1
is	1
not	1
of	1
us,	1
who	1
knows	1
our	1
grave	1
purpose,	1
but	1
does	1
not	1
share	1
it,	1
who--"	1
The	1
Secretary	1
screamed	1
out	1
suddenly	1
like	1
a	1
woman.	1
"It	1
can't	1
be!"	1
he	1
cried,	1
leaping.	1
"There	1
can't--"	1
The	1
President	1
flapped	1
his	1
large	1
flat	1
hand	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
like	1
the	1
fin	1
of	1
some	1
huge	1
fish.	1
"Yes,"	1
he	1
said	1
slowly,	1
"there	1
is	1
a	1
spy	1
in	1
this	1
room.	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
traitor	1
at	1
this	1
table.	1
I	1
will	1
waste	1
no	1
more	1
words.	1
His	1
name--"	1
Syme	1
half	1
rose	1
from	1
his	1
seat,	1
his	1
finger	1
firm	1
on	1
the	1
trigger.	1
"His	1
name	1
is	1
Gogol,"	1
said	1
the	1
President.	1
"He	1
is	1
that	1
hairy	1
humbug	1
over	1
there	1
who	1
pretends	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
Pole."	1
Gogol	1
sprang	1
to	1
his	1
feet,	1
a	1
pistol	1
in	1
each	1
hand.	1
With	1
the	1
same	1
flash	1
three	1
men	1
sprang	1
at	1
his	1
throat.	1
Even	1
the	1
Professor	1
made	1
an	1
effort	1
to	1
rise.	1
But	1
Syme	1
saw	1
little	1
of	1
the	1
scene,	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
blinded	1
with	1
a	1
beneficent	1
darkness;	1
he	1
had	1
sunk	1
down	1
into	1
his	1
seat	1
shuddering,	1
in	1
a	1
palsy	1
of	1
passionate	1
relief.	1
CHAPTER	1
VII	1
THE	1
UNACCOUNTABLE	1
CONDUCT	1
OF	1
PROFESSOR	1
DE	1
WORMS	1
"SIT	1
down!"	1
said	1
Sunday	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
that	1
he	1
used	1
once	1
or	1
twice	1
in	1
his	1
life,	1
a	1
voice	1
that	1
made	1
men	1
drop	1
drawn	1
swords.	1
The	1
three	1
who	1
had	1
risen	1
fell	1
away	1
from	1
Gogol,	1
and	1
that	1
equivocal	1
person	1
himself	1
resumed	1
his	1
seat.	1
"Well,	1
my	1
man,"	1
said	1
the	1
President	1
briskly,	1
addressing	1
him	1
as	1
one	1
addresses	1
a	1
total	1
stranger,	1
"will	1
you	1
oblige	1
me	1
by	1
putting	1
your	1
hand	1
in	1
your	1
upper	1
waistcoat	1
pocket	1
and	1
showing	1
me	1
what	1
you	1
have	1
there?"	1
The	1
alleged	1
Pole	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
pale	1
under	1
his	1
tangle	1
of	1
dark	1
hair,	1
but	1
he	1
put	1
two	1
fingers	1
into	1
the	1
pocket	1
with	1
apparent	1
coolness	1
and	1
pulled	1
out	1
a	1
blue	1
strip	1
of	1
card.	1
When	1
Syme	1
saw	1
it	1
lying	1
on	1
the	1
table,	1
he	1
woke	1
up	1
again	1
to	1
the	1
world	1
outside	1
him.	1
For	1
although	1
the	1
card	1
lay	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
extreme	1
of	1
the	1
table,	1
and	1
he	1
could	1
read	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
inscription	1
on	1
it,	1
it	1
bore	1
a	1
startling	1
resemblance	1
to	1
the	1
blue	1
card	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
pocket,	1
the	1
card	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
given	1
to	1
him	1
when	1
he	1
joined	1
the	1
anti-anarchist	1
constabulary.	1
"Pathetic	1
Slav,"	1
said	1
the	1
President,	1
"tragic	1
child	1
of	1
Poland,	1
are	1
you	1
prepared	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
that	1
card	1
to	1
deny	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
in	1
this	1
company--shall	1
we	1
say	1
de	1
trop?"	1
"Right	1
oh!"	1
said	1
the	1
late	1
Gogol.	1
It	1
made	1
everyone	1
jump	1
to	1
hear	1
a	1
clear,	1
commercial	1
and	1
somewhat	1
cockney	1
voice	1
coming	1
out	1
of	1
that	1
forest	1
of	1
foreign	1
hair.	1
It	1
was	1
irrational,	1
as	1
if	1
a	1
Chinaman	1
had	1
suddenly	1
spoken	1
with	1
a	1
Scotch	1
accent.	1
"I	1
gather	1
that	1
you	1
fully	1
understand	1
your	1
position,"	1
said	1
Sunday.	1
"You	1
bet,"	1
answered	1
the	1
Pole.	1
"I	1
see	1
it's	1
a	1
fair	1
cop.	1
All	1
I	1
say	1
is,	1
I	1
don't	1
believe	1
any	1
Pole	1
could	1
have	1
imitated	1
my	1
accent	1
like	1
I	1
did	1
his."	1
"I	1
concede	1
the	1
point,"	1
said	1
Sunday.	1
"I	1
believe	1
your	1
own	1
accent	1
to	1
be	1
inimitable,	1
though	1
I	1
shall	1
practise	1
it	1
in	1
my	1
bath.	1
Do	1
you	1
mind	1
leaving	1
your	1
beard	1
with	1
your	1
card?"	1
"Not	1
a	1
bit,"	1
answered	1
Gogol;	1
and	1
with	1
one	1
finger	1
he	1
ripped	1
off	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
his	1
shaggy	1
head-covering,	1
emerging	1
with	1
thin	1
red	1
hair	1
and	1
a	1
pale,	1
pert	1
face.	1
"It	1
was	1
hot,"	1
he	1
added.	1
"I	1
will	1
do	1
you	1
the	1
justice	1
to	1
say,"	1
said	1
Sunday,	1
not	1
without	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
brutal	1
admiration,	1
"that	1
you	1
seem	1
to	1
have	1
kept	1
pretty	1
cool	1
under	1
it.	1
Now	1
listen	1
to	1
me.	1
I	1
like	1
you.	1
The	1
consequence	1
is	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
annoy	1
me	1
for	1
just	1
about	1
two	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
minutes	1
if	1
I	1
heard	1
that	1
you	1
had	1
died	1
in	1
torments.	1
Well,	1
if	1
you	1
ever	1
tell	1
the	1
police	1
or	1
any	1
human	1
soul	1
about	1
us,	1
I	1
shall	1
have	1
that	1
two	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
minutes	1
of	1
discomfort.	1
On	1
your	1
discomfort	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
dwell.	1
Good	1
day.	1
Mind	1
the	1
step."	1
The	1
red-haired	1
detective	1
who	1
had	1
masqueraded	1
as	1
Gogol	1
rose	1
to	1
his	1
feet	1
without	1
a	1
word,	1
and	1
walked	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
with	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
perfect	1
nonchalance.	1
Yet	1
the	1
astonished	1
Syme	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
realise	1
that	1
this	1
ease	1
was	1
suddenly	1
assumed;	1
for	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
slight	1
stumble	1
outside	1
the	1
door,	1
which	1
showed	1
that	1
the	1
departing	1
detective	1
had	1
not	1
minded	1
the	1
step.	1
"Time	1
is	1
flying,"	1
said	1
the	1
President	1
in	1
his	1
gayest	1
manner,	1
after	1
glancing	1
at	1
his	1
watch,	1
which	1
like	1
everything	1
about	1
him	1
seemed	1
bigger	1
than	1
it	1
ought	1
to	1
be.	1
"I	1
must	1
go	1
off	1
at	1
once;	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
chair	1
at	1
a	1
Humanitarian	1
meeting."	1
The	1
Secretary	1
turned	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
working	1
eyebrows.	1
"Would	1
it	1
not	1
be	1
better,"	1
he	1
said	1
a	1
little	1
sharply,	1
"to	1
discuss	1
further	1
the	1
details	1
of	1
our	1
project,	1
now	1
that	1
the	1
spy	1
has	1
left	1
us?"	1
"No,	1
I	1
think	1
not,"	1
said	1
the	1
President	1
with	1
a	1
yawn	1
like	1
an	1
unobtrusive	1
earthquake.	1
"Leave	1
it	1
as	1
it	1
is.	1
Let	1
Saturday	1
settle	1
it.	1
I	1
must	1
be	1
off.	1
Breakfast	1
here	1
next	1
Sunday."	1
But	1
the	1
late	1
loud	1
scenes	1
had	1
whipped	1
up	1
the	1
almost	1
naked	1
nerves	1
of	1
the	1
Secretary.	1
He	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
men	1
who	1
are	1
conscientious	1
even	1
in	1
crime.	1
"I	1
must	1
protest,	1
President,	1
that	1
the	1
thing	1
is	1
irregular,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"It	1
is	1
a	1
fundamental	1
rule	1
of	1
our	1
society	1
that	1
all	1
plans	1
shall	1
be	1
debated	1
in	1
full	1
council.	1
Of	1
course,	1
I	1
fully	1
appreciate	1
your	1
forethought	1
when	1
in	1
the	1
actual	1
presence	1
of	1
a	1
traitor--"	1
"Secretary,"	1
said	1
the	1
President	1
seriously,	1
"if	1
you'd	1
take	1
your	1
head	1
home	1
and	1
boil	1
it	1
for	1
a	1
turnip	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
useful.	1
I	1
can't	1
say.	1
But	1
it	1
might.	1
The	1
Secretary	1
reared	1
back	1
in	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
equine	1
anger.	1
"I	1
really	1
fail	1
to	1
understand--"	1
he	1
began	1
in	1
high	1
offense.	1
"That's	1
it,	1
that's	1
it,"	1
said	1
the	1
President,	1
nodding	1
a	1
great	1
many	1
times.	1
"That's	1
where	1
you	1
fail	1
right	1
enough.	1
You	1
fail	1
to	1
understand.	1
Why,	1
you	1
dancing	1
donkey,"	1
he	1
roared,	1
rising,	1
"you	1
didn't	1
want	1
to	1
be	1
overheard	1
by	1
a	1
spy,	1
didn't	1
you?	1
How	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
you	1
aren't	1
overheard	1
now?"	1
And	1
with	1
these	1
words	1
he	1
shouldered	1
his	1
way	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room,	1
shaking	1
with	1
incomprehensible	1
scorn.	1
Four	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
left	1
behind	1
gaped	1
after	1
him	1
without	1
any	1
apparent	1
glimmering	1
of	1
his	1
meaning.	1
Syme	1
alone	1
had	1
even	1
a	1
glimmering,	1
and	1
such	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
it	1
froze	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
bone.	1
If	1
the	1
last	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
President	1
meant	1
anything,	1
they	1
meant	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
after	1
all	1
passed	1
unsuspected.	1
They	1
meant	1
that	1
while	1
Sunday	1
could	1
not	1
denounce	1
him	1
like	1
Gogol,	1
he	1
still	1
could	1
not	1
trust	1
him	1
like	1
the	1
others.	1
The	1
other	1
four	1
got	1
to	1
their	1
feet	1
grumbling	1
more	1
or	1
less,	1
and	1
betook	1
themselves	1
elsewhere	1
to	1
find	1
lunch,	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
already	1
well	1
past	1
midday.	1
The	1
Professor	1
went	1
last,	1
very	1
slowly	1
and	1
painfully.	1
Syme	1
sat	1
long	1
after	1
the	1
rest	1
had	1
gone,	1
revolving	1
his	1
strange	1
position.	1
He	1
had	1
escaped	1
a	1
thunderbolt,	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
still	1
under	1
a	1
cloud.	1
At	1
last	1
he	1
rose	1
and	1
made	1
his	1
way	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hotel	1
into	1
Leicester	1
Square.	1
The	1
bright,	1
cold	1
day	1
had	1
grown	1
increasingly	1
colder,	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
street	1
he	1
was	1
surprised	1
by	1
a	1
few	1
flakes	1
of	1
snow.	1
While	1
he	1
still	1
carried	1
the	1
sword-stick	1
and	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
Gregory's	1
portable	1
luggage,	1
he	1
had	1
thrown	1
the	1
cloak	1
down	1
and	1
left	1
it	1
somewhere,	1
perhaps	1
on	1
the	1
steam-tug,	1
perhaps	1
on	1
the	1
balcony.	1
Hoping,	1
therefore,	1
that	1
the	1
snow-shower	1
might	1
be	1
slight,	1
he	1
stepped	1
back	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
street	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
and	1
stood	1
up	1
under	1
the	1
doorway	1
of	1
a	1
small	1
and	1
greasy	1
hair-dresser's	1
shop,	1
the	1
front	1
window	1
of	1
which	1
was	1
empty,	1
except	1
for	1
a	1
sickly	1
wax	1
lady	1
in	1
evening	1
dress.	1
Snow,	1
however,	1
began	1
to	1
thicken	1
and	1
fall	1
fast;	1
and	1
Syme,	1
having	1
found	1
one	1
glance	1
at	1
the	1
wax	1
lady	1
quite	1
sufficient	1
to	1
depress	1
his	1
spirits,	1
stared	1
out	1
instead	1
into	1
the	1
white	1
and	1
empty	1
street.	1
He	1
was	1
considerably	1
astonished	1
to	1
see,	1
standing	1
quite	1
still	1
outside	1
the	1
shop	1
and	1
staring	1
into	1
the	1
window,	1
a	1
man.	1
His	1
top	1
hat	1
was	1
loaded	1
with	1
snow	1
like	1
the	1
hat	1
of	1
Father	1
Christmas,	1
the	1
white	1
drift	1
was	1
rising	1
round	1
his	1
boots	1
and	1
ankles;	1
but	1
it	1
seemed	1
as	1
if	1
nothing	1
could	1
tear	1
him	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
contemplation	1
of	1
the	1
colourless	1
wax	1
doll	1
in	1
dirty	1
evening	1
dress.	1
That	1
any	1
human	1
being	1
should	1
stand	1
in	1
such	1
weather	1
looking	1
into	1
such	1
a	1
shop	1
was	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
sufficient	1
wonder	1
to	1
Syme;	1
but	1
his	1
idle	1
wonder	1
turned	1
suddenly	1
into	1
a	1
personal	1
shock;	1
for	1
he	1
realised	1
that	1
the	1
man	1
standing	1
there	1
was	1
the	1
paralytic	1
old	1
Professor	1
de	1
Worms.	1
It	1
scarcely	1
seemed	1
the	1
place	1
for	1
a	1
person	1
of	1
his	1
years	1
and	1
infirmities.	1
Syme	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
believe	1
anything	1
about	1
the	1
perversions	1
of	1
this	1
dehumanized	1
brotherhood;	1
but	1
even	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
believe	1
that	1
the	1
Professor	1
had	1
fallen	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
that	1
particular	1
wax	1
lady.	1
He	1
could	1
only	1
suppose	1
that	1
the	1
man's	1
malady	1
(whatever	1
it	1
was)	1
involved	1
some	1
momentary	1
fits	1
of	1
rigidity	1
or	1
trance.	1
He	1
was	1
not	1
inclined,	1
however,	1
to	1
feel	1
in	1
this	1
case	1
any	1
very	1
compassionate	1
concern.	1
On	1
the	1
contrary,	1
he	1
rather	1
congratulated	1
himself	1
that	1
the	1
Professor's	1
stroke	1
and	1
his	1
elaborate	1
and	1
limping	1
walk	1
would	1
make	1
it	1
easy	1
to	1
escape	1
from	1
him	1
and	1
leave	1
him	1
miles	1
behind.	1
For	1
Syme	1
thirsted	1
first	1
and	1
last	1
to	1
get	1
clear	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
poisonous	1
atmosphere,	1
if	1
only	1
for	1
an	1
hour.	1
Then	1
he	1
could	1
collect	1
his	1
thoughts,	1
formulate	1
his	1
policy,	1
and	1
decide	1
finally	1
whether	1
he	1
should	1
or	1
should	1
not	1
keep	1
faith	1
with	1
Gregory.	1
He	1
strolled	1
away	1
through	1
the	1
dancing	1
snow,	1
turned	1
up	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
streets,	1
down	1
through	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
others,	1
and	1
entered	1
a	1
small	1
Soho	1
restaurant	1
for	1
lunch.	1
He	1
partook	1
reflectively	1
of	1
four	1
small	1
and	1
quaint	1
courses,	1
drank	1
half	1
a	1
bottle	1
of	1
red	1
wine,	1
and	1
ended	1
up	1
over	1
black	1
coffee	1
and	1
a	1
black	1
cigar,	1
still	1
thinking.	1
He	1
had	1
taken	1
his	1
seat	1
in	1
the	1
upper	1
room	1
of	1
the	1
restaurant,	1
which	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
chink	1
of	1
knives	1
and	1
the	1
chatter	1
of	1
foreigners.	1
He	1
remembered	1
that	1
in	1
old	1
days	1
he	1
had	1
imagined	1
that	1
all	1
these	1
harmless	1
and	1
kindly	1
aliens	1
were	1
anarchists.	1
He	1
shuddered,	1
remembering	1
the	1
real	1
thing.	1
But	1
even	1
the	1
shudder	1
had	1
the	1
delightful	1
shame	1
of	1
escape.	1
The	1
wine,	1
the	1
common	1
food,	1
the	1
familiar	1
place,	1
the	1
faces	1
of	1
natural	1
and	1
talkative	1
men,	1
made	1
him	1
almost	1
feel	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
Council	1
of	1
the	1
Seven	1
Days	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
bad	1
dream;	1
and	1
although	1
he	1
knew	1
it	1
was	1
nevertheless	1
an	1
objective	1
reality,	1
it	1
was	1
at	1
least	1
a	1
distant	1
one.	1
Tall	1
houses	1
and	1
populous	1
streets	1
lay	1
between	1
him	1
and	1
his	1
last	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
shameful	1
seven;	1
he	1
was	1
free	1
in	1
free	1
London,	1
and	1
drinking	1
wine	1
among	1
the	1
free.	1
With	1
a	1
somewhat	1
easier	1
action,	1
he	1
took	1
his	1
hat	1
and	1
stick	1
and	1
strolled	1
down	1
the	1
stair	1
into	1
the	1
shop	1
below.	1
When	1
he	1
entered	1
that	1
lower	1
room	1
he	1
stood	1
stricken	1
and	1
rooted	1
to	1
the	1
spot.	1
At	1
a	1
small	1
table,	1
close	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
blank	1
window	1
and	1
the	1
white	1
street	1
of	1
snow,	1
sat	1
the	1
old	1
anarchist	1
Professor	1
over	1
a	1
glass	1
of	1
milk,	1
with	1
his	1
lifted	1
livid	1
face	1
and	1
pendent	1
eyelids.	1
For	1
an	1
instant	1
Syme	1
stood	1
as	1
rigid	1
as	1
the	1
stick	1
he	1
leant	1
upon.	1
Then	1
with	1
a	1
gesture	1
as	1
of	1
blind	1
hurry,	1
he	1
brushed	1
past	1
the	1
Professor,	1
dashing	1
open	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
slamming	1
it	1
behind	1
him,	1
and	1
stood	1
outside	1
in	1
the	1
snow.	1
"Can	1
that	1
old	1
corpse	1
be	1
following	1
me?"	1
he	1
asked	1
himself,	1
biting	1
his	1
yellow	1
moustache.	1
"I	1
stopped	1
too	1
long	1
up	1
in	1
that	1
room,	1
so	1
that	1
even	1
such	1
leaden	1
feet	1
could	1
catch	1
me	1
up.	1
One	1
comfort	1
is,	1
with	1
a	1
little	1
brisk	1
walking	1
I	1
can	1
put	1
a	1
man	1
like	1
that	1
as	1
far	1
away	1
as	1
Timbuctoo.	1
Or	1
am	1
I	1
too	1
fanciful?	1
Was	1
he	1
really	1
following	1
me?	1
Surely	1
Sunday	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
such	1
a	1
fool	1
as	1
to	1
send	1
a	1
lame	1
man?	1
"	1
He	1
set	1
off	1
at	1
a	1
smart	1
pace,	1
twisting	1
and	1
whirling	1
his	1
stick,	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
Covent	1
Garden.	1
As	1
he	1
crossed	1
the	1
great	1
market	1
the	1
snow	1
increased,	1
growing	1
blinding	1
and	1
bewildering	1
as	1
the	1
afternoon	1
began	1
to	1
darken.	1
The	1
snow-flakes	1
tormented	1
him	1
like	1
a	1
swarm	1
of	1
silver	1
bees.	1
Getting	1
into	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
beard,	1
they	1
added	1
their	1
unremitting	1
futility	1
to	1
his	1
already	1
irritated	1
nerves;	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
at	1
a	1
swinging	1
pace	1
to	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
Fleet	1
Street,	1
he	1
lost	1
patience,	1
and	1
finding	1
a	1
Sunday	1
teashop,	1
turned	1
into	1
it	1
to	1
take	1
shelter.	1
He	1
ordered	1
another	1
cup	1
of	1
black	1
coffee	1
as	1
an	1
excuse.	1
Scarcely	1
had	1
he	1
done	1
so,	1
when	1
Professor	1
de	1
Worms	1
hobbled	1
heavily	1
into	1
the	1
shop,	1
sat	1
down	1
with	1
difficulty	1
and	1
ordered	1
a	1
glass	1
of	1
milk.	1
Syme's	1
walking-stick	1
had	1
fallen	1
from	1
his	1
hand	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
clang,	1
which	1
confessed	1
the	1
concealed	1
steel.	1
But	1
the	1
Professor	1
did	1
not	1
look	1
round.	1
Syme,	1
who	1
was	1
commonly	1
a	1
cool	1
character,	1
was	1
literally	1
gaping	1
as	1
a	1
rustic	1
gapes	1
at	1
a	1
conjuring	1
trick.	1
He	1
had	1
seen	1
no	1
cab	1
following;	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
no	1
wheels	1
outside	1
the	1
shop;	1
to	1
all	1
mortal	1
appearances	1
the	1
man	1
had	1
come	1
on	1
foot.	1
But	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
could	1
only	1
walk	1
like	1
a	1
snail,	1
and	1
Syme	1
had	1
walked	1
like	1
the	1
wind.	1
He	1
started	1
up	1
and	1
snatched	1
his	1
stick,	1
half	1
crazy	1
with	1
the	1
contradiction	1
in	1
mere	1
arithmetic,	1
and	1
swung	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
swinging	1
doors,	1
leaving	1
his	1
coffee	1
untasted.	1
An	1
omnibus	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
Bank	1
went	1
rattling	1
by	1
with	1
an	1
unusual	1
rapidity.	1
He	1
had	1
a	1
violent	1
run	1
of	1
a	1
hundred	1
yards	1
to	1
reach	1
it;	1
but	1
he	1
managed	1
to	1
spring,	1
swaying	1
upon	1
the	1
splash-board	1
and,	1
pausing	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
to	1
pant,	1
he	1
climbed	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
top.	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
seated	1
for	1
about	1
half	1
a	1
minute,	1
he	1
heard	1
behind	1
him	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
heavy	1
and	1
asthmatic	1
breathing.	1
Turning	1
sharply,	1
he	1
saw	1
rising	1
gradually	1
higher	1
and	1
higher	1
up	1
the	1
omnibus	1
steps	1
a	1
top	1
hat	1
soiled	1
and	1
dripping	1
with	1
snow,	1
and	1
under	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
its	1
brim	1
the	1
short-sighted	1
face	1
and	1
shaky	1
shoulders	1
of	1
Professor	1
de	1
Worms.	1
He	1
let	1
himself	1
into	1
a	1
seat	1
with	1
characteristic	1
care,	1
and	1
wrapped	1
himself	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
chin	1
in	1
the	1
mackintosh	1
rug.	1
Every	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
man's	1
tottering	1
figure	1
and	1
vague	1
hands,	1
every	1
uncertain	1
gesture	1
and	1
panic-stricken	1
pause,	1
seemed	1
to	1
put	1
it	1
beyond	1
question	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
helpless,	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
imbecility	1
of	1
the	1
body.	1
He	1
moved	1
by	1
inches,	1
he	1
let	1
himself	1
down	1
with	1
little	1
gasps	1
of	1
caution.	1
And	1
yet,	1
unless	1
the	1
philosophical	1
entities	1
called	1
time	1
and	1
space	1
have	1
no	1
vestige	1
even	1
of	1
a	1
practical	1
existence,	1
it	1
appeared	1
quite	1
unquestionable	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
run	1
after	1
the	1
omnibus.	1
Syme	1
sprang	1
erect	1
upon	1
the	1
rocking	1
car,	1
and	1
after	1
staring	1
wildly	1
at	1
the	1
wintry	1
sky,	1
that	1
grew	1
gloomier	1
every	1
moment,	1
he	1
ran	1
down	1
the	1
steps.	1
He	1
had	1
repressed	1
an	1
elemental	1
impulse	1
to	1
leap	1
over	1
the	1
side.	1
Too	1
bewildered	1
to	1
look	1
back	1
or	1
to	1
reason,	1
he	1
rushed	1
into	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
courts	1
at	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
Fleet	1
Street	1
as	1
a	1
rabbit	1
rushes	1
into	1
a	1
hole.	1
He	1
had	1
a	1
vague	1
idea,	1
if	1
this	1
incomprehensible	1
old	1
Jack-in-the-box	1
was	1
really	1
pursuing	1
him,	1
that	1
in	1
that	1
labyrinth	1
of	1
little	1
streets	1
he	1
could	1
soon	1
throw	1
him	1
off	1
the	1
scent.	1
He	1
dived	1
in	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
those	1
crooked	1
lanes,	1
which	1
were	1
more	1
like	1
cracks	1
than	1
thoroughfares;	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
completed	1
about	1
twenty	1
alternate	1
angles	1
and	1
described	1
an	1
unthinkable	1
polygon,	1
he	1
paused	1
to	1
listen	1
for	1
any	1
sound	1
of	1
pursuit.	1
There	1
was	1
none;	1
there	1
could	1
not	1
in	1
any	1
case	1
have	1
been	1
much,	1
for	1
the	1
little	1
streets	1
were	1
thick	1
with	1
the	1
soundless	1
snow.	1
Somewhere	1
behind	1
Red	1
Lion	1
Court,	1
however,	1
he	1
noticed	1
a	1
place	1
where	1
some	1
energetic	1
citizen	1
had	1
cleared	1
away	1
the	1
snow	1
for	1
a	1
space	1
of	1
about	1
twenty	1
yards,	1
leaving	1
the	1
wet,	1
glistening	1
cobble-stones.	1
He	1
thought	1
little	1
of	1
this	1
as	1
he	1
passed	1
it,	1
only	1
plunging	1
into	1
yet	1
another	1
arm	1
of	1
the	1
maze.	1
But	1
when	1
a	1
few	1
hundred	1
yards	1
farther	1
on	1
he	1
stood	1
still	1
again	1
to	1
listen,	1
his	1
heart	1
stood	1
still	1
also,	1
for	1
he	1
heard	1
from	1
that	1
space	1
of	1
rugged	1
stones	1
the	1
clinking	1
crutch	1
and	1
labouring	1
feet	1
of	1
the	1
infernal	1
cripple.	1
The	1
sky	1
above	1
was	1
loaded	1
with	1
the	1
clouds	1
of	1
snow,	1
leaving	1
London	1
in	1
a	1
darkness	1
and	1
oppression	1
premature	1
for	1
that	1
hour	1
of	1
the	1
evening.	1
On	1
each	1
side	1
of	1
Syme	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
the	1
alley	1
were	1
blind	1
and	1
featureless;	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
little	1
window	1
or	1
any	1
kind	1
of	1
eve.	1
He	1
felt	1
a	1
new	1
impulse	1
to	1
break	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
hive	1
of	1
houses,	1
and	1
to	1
get	1
once	1
more	1
into	1
the	1
open	1
and	1
lamp-lit	1
street.	1
Yet	1
he	1
rambled	1
and	1
dodged	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
before	1
he	1
struck	1
the	1
main	1
thoroughfare.	1
When	1
he	1
did	1
so,	1
he	1
struck	1
it	1
much	1
farther	1
up	1
than	1
he	1
had	1
fancied.	1
He	1
came	1
out	1
into	1
what	1
seemed	1
the	1
vast	1
and	1
void	1
of	1
Ludgate	1
Circus,	1
and	1
saw	1
St.	1
Paul's	1
Cathedral	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
sky.	1
At	1
first	1
he	1
was	1
startled	1
to	1
find	1
these	1
great	1
roads	1
so	1
empty,	1
as	1
if	1
a	1
pestilence	1
had	1
swept	1
through	1
the	1
city.	1
Then	1
he	1
told	1
himself	1
that	1
some	1
degree	1
of	1
emptiness	1
was	1
natural;	1
first	1
because	1
the	1
snow-storm	1
was	1
even	1
dangerously	1
deep,	1
and	1
secondly	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
Sunday.	1
And	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
word	1
Sunday	1
he	1
bit	1
his	1
lip;	1
the	1
word	1
was	1
henceforth	1
for	1
hire	1
like	1
some	1
indecent	1
pun.	1
Under	1
the	1
white	1
fog	1
of	1
snow	1
high	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
heaven	1
the	1
whole	1
atmosphere	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
was	1
turned	1
to	1
a	1
very	1
queer	1
kind	1
of	1
green	1
twilight,	1
as	1
of	1
men	1
under	1
the	1
sea.	1
The	1
sealed	1
and	1
sullen	1
sunset	1
behind	1
the	1
dark	1
dome	1
of	1
St.	1
Paul's	1
had	1
in	1
it	1
smoky	1
and	1
sinister	1
colours--colours	1
of	1
sickly	1
green,	1
dead	1
red	1
or	1
decaying	1
bronze,	1
that	1
were	1
just	1
bright	1
enough	1
to	1
emphasise	1
the	1
solid	1
whiteness	1
of	1
the	1
snow.	1
But	1
right	1
up	1
against	1
these	1
dreary	1
colours	1
rose	1
the	1
black	1
bulk	1
of	1
the	1
cathedral;	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
cathedral	1
was	1
a	1
random	1
splash	1
and	1
great	1
stain	1
of	1
snow,	1
still	1
clinging	1
as	1
to	1
an	1
Alpine	1
peak.	1
It	1
had	1
fallen	1
accidentally,	1
but	1
just	1
so	1
fallen	1
as	1
to	1
half	1
drape	1
the	1
dome	1
from	1
its	1
very	1
topmost	1
point,	1
and	1
to	1
pick	1
out	1
in	1
perfect	1
silver	1
the	1
great	1
orb	1
and	1
the	1
cross.	1
When	1
Syme	1
saw	1
it	1
he	1
suddenly	1
straightened	1
himself,	1
and	1
made	1
with	1
his	1
sword-stick	1
an	1
involuntary	1
salute.	1
He	1
knew	1
that	1
that	1
evil	1
figure,	1
his	1
shadow,	1
was	1
creeping	1
quickly	1
or	1
slowly	1
behind	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
care.	1
It	1
seemed	1
a	1
symbol	1
of	1
human	1
faith	1
and	1
valour	1
that	1
while	1
the	1
skies	1
were	1
darkening	1
that	1
high	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
was	1
bright.	1
The	1
devils	1
might	1
have	1
captured	1
heaven,	1
but	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
captured	1
the	1
cross.	1
He	1
had	1
a	1
new	1
impulse	1
to	1
tear	1
out	1
the	1
secret	1
of	1
this	1
dancing,	1
jumping	1
and	1
pursuing	1
paralytic;	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
entrance	1
of	1
the	1
court	1
as	1
it	1
opened	1
upon	1
the	1
Circus	1
he	1
turned,	1
stick	1
in	1
hand,	1
to	1
face	1
his	1
pursuer.	1
Professor	1
de	1
Worms	1
came	1
slowly	1
round	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
irregular	1
alley	1
behind	1
him,	1
his	1
unnatural	1
form	1
outlined	1
against	1
a	1
lonely	1
gas-lamp,	1
irresistibly	1
recalling	1
that	1
very	1
imaginative	1
figure	1
in	1
the	1
nursery	1
rhymes,	1
"the	1
crooked	1
man	1
who	1
went	1
a	1
crooked	1
mile."	1
He	1
really	1
looked	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
twisted	1
out	1
of	1
shape	1
by	1
the	1
tortuous	1
streets	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
threading.	1
He	1
came	1
nearer	1
and	1
nearer,	1
the	1
lamplight	1
shining	1
on	1
his	1
lifted	1
spectacles,	1
his	1
lifted,	1
patient	1
face.	1
Syme	1
waited	1
for	1
him	1
as	1
St.	1
George	1
waited	1
for	1
the	1
dragon,	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
waits	1
for	1
a	1
final	1
explanation	1
or	1
for	1
death.	1
And	1
the	1
old	1
Professor	1
came	1
right	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
passed	1
him	1
like	1
a	1
total	1
stranger,	1
without	1
even	1
a	1
blink	1
of	1
his	1
mournful	1
eyelids.	1
There	1
was	1
something	1
in	1
this	1
silent	1
and	1
unexpected	1
innocence	1
that	1
left	1
Syme	1
in	1
a	1
final	1
fury.	1
The	1
man's	1
colourless	1
face	1
and	1
manner	1
seemed	1
to	1
assert	1
that	1
the	1
whole	1
following	1
had	1
been	1
an	1
accident.	1
Syme	1
was	1
galvanised	1
with	1
an	1
energy	1
that	1
was	1
something	1
between	1
bitterness	1
and	1
a	1
burst	1
of	1
boyish	1
derision.	1
He	1
made	1
a	1
wild	1
gesture	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
knock	1
the	1
old	1
man's	1
hat	1
off,	1
called	1
out	1
something	1
like	1
"Catch	1
me	1
if	1
you	1
can,"	1
and	1
went	1
racing	1
away	1
across	1
the	1
white,	1
open	1
Circus.	1
Concealment	1
was	1
impossible	1
now;	1
and	1
looking	1
back	1
over	1
his	1
shoulder,	1
he	1
could	1
see	1
the	1
black	1
figure	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
gentleman	1
coming	1
after	1
him	1
with	1
long,	1
swinging	1
strides	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
winning	1
a	1
mile	1
race.	1
But	1
the	1
head	1
upon	1
that	1
bounding	1
body	1
was	1
still	1
pale,	1
grave	1
and	1
professional,	1
like	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
a	1
lecturer	1
upon	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
a	1
harlequin.	1
This	1
outrageous	1
chase	1
sped	1
across	1
Ludgate	1
Circus,	1
up	1
Ludgate	1
Hill,	1
round	1
St.	1
Paul's	1
Cathedral,	1
along	1
Cheapside,	1
Syme	1
remembering	1
all	1
the	1
nightmares	1
he	1
had	1
ever	1
known.	1
Then	1
Syme	1
broke	1
away	1
towards	1
the	1
river,	1
and	1
ended	1
almost	1
down	1
by	1
the	1
docks.	1
He	1
saw	1
the	1
yellow	1
panes	1
of	1
a	1
low,	1
lighted	1
public-house,	1
flung	1
himself	1
into	1
it	1
and	1
ordered	1
beer.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
foul	1
tavern,	1
sprinkled	1
with	1
foreign	1
sailors,	1
a	1
place	1
where	1
opium	1
might	1
be	1
smoked	1
or	1
knives	1
drawn.	1
A	1
moment	1
later	1
Professor	1
de	1
Worms	1
entered	1
the	1
place,	1
sat	1
down	1
carefully,	1
and	1
asked	1
for	1
a	1
glass	1
of	1
milk.	1
CHAPTER	1
VIII	1
THE	1
PROFESSOR	1
EXPLAINS	1
WHEN	1
Gabriel	1
Syme	1
found	1
himself	1
finally	1
established	1
in	1
a	1
chair,	1
and	1
opposite	1
to	1
him,	1
fixed	1
and	1
final	1
also,	1
the	1
lifted	1
eyebrows	1
and	1
leaden	1
eyelids	1
of	1
the	1
Professor,	1
his	1
fears	1
fully	1
returned.	1
This	1
incomprehensible	1
man	1
from	1
the	1
fierce	1
council,	1
after	1
all,	1
had	1
certainly	1
pursued	1
him.	1
If	1
the	1
man	1
had	1
one	1
character	1
as	1
a	1
paralytic	1
and	1
another	1
character	1
as	1
a	1
pursuer,	1
the	1
antithesis	1
might	1
make	1
him	1
more	1
interesting,	1
but	1
scarcely	1
more	1
soothing.	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
very	1
small	1
comfort	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
find	1
the	1
Professor	1
out,	1
if	1
by	1
some	1
serious	1
accident	1
the	1
Professor	1
should	1
find	1
him	1
out.	1
He	1
emptied	1
a	1
whole	1
pewter	1
pot	1
of	1
ale	1
before	1
the	1
professor	1
had	1
touched	1
his	1
milk.	1
One	1
possibility,	1
however,	1
kept	1
him	1
hopeful	1
and	1
yet	1
helpless.	1
It	1
was	1
just	1
possible	1
that	1
this	1
escapade	1
signified	1
something	1
other	1
than	1
even	1
a	1
slight	1
suspicion	1
of	1
him.	1
Perhaps	1
it	1
was	1
some	1
regular	1
form	1
or	1
sign.	1
Perhaps	1
the	1
foolish	1
scamper	1
was	1
some	1
sort	1
of	1
friendly	1
signal	1
that	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
understood.	1
Perhaps	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
ritual.	1
Perhaps	1
the	1
new	1
Thursday	1
was	1
always	1
chased	1
along	1
Cheapside,	1
as	1
the	1
new	1
Lord	1
Mayor	1
is	1
always	1
escorted	1
along	1
it.	1
He	1
was	1
just	1
selecting	1
a	1
tentative	1
inquiry,	1
when	1
the	1
old	1
Professor	1
opposite	1
suddenly	1
and	1
simply	1
cut	1
him	1
short.	1
Before	1
Syme	1
could	1
ask	1
the	1
first	1
diplomatic	1
question,	1
the	1
old	1
anarchist	1
had	1
asked	1
suddenly,	1
without	1
any	1
sort	1
of	1
preparation--	1
"Are	1
you	1
a	1
policeman?"	1
Whatever	1
else	1
Syme	1
had	1
expected,	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
expected	1
anything	1
so	1
brutal	1
and	1
actual	1
as	1
this.	1
Even	1
his	1
great	1
presence	1
of	1
mind	1
could	1
only	1
manage	1
a	1
reply	1
with	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
rather	1
blundering	1
jocularity.	1
"A	1
policeman?"	1
he	1
said,	1
laughing	1
vaguely.	1
"Whatever	1
made	1
you	1
think	1
of	1
a	1
policeman	1
in	1
connection	1
with	1
me?"	1
"The	1
process	1
was	1
simple	1
enough,"	1
answered	1
the	1
Professor	1
patiently.	1
"I	1
thought	1
you	1
looked	1
like	1
a	1
policeman.	1
I	1
think	1
so	1
now."	1
"Did	1
I	1
take	1
a	1
policeman's	1
hat	1
by	1
mistake	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
restaurant?"	1
asked	1
Syme,	1
smiling	1
wildly.	1
"Have	1
I	1
by	1
any	1
chance	1
got	1
a	1
number	1
stuck	1
on	1
to	1
me	1
somewhere?	1
Have	1
my	1
boots	1
got	1
that	1
watchful	1
look?	1
Why	1
must	1
I	1
be	1
a	1
policeman?	1
Do,	1
do	1
let	1
me	1
be	1
a	1
postman."	1
The	1
old	1
Professor	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
with	1
a	1
gravity	1
that	1
gave	1
no	1
hope,	1
but	1
Syme	1
ran	1
on	1
with	1
a	1
feverish	1
irony.	1
"But	1
perhaps	1
I	1
misunderstood	1
the	1
delicacies	1
of	1
your	1
German	1
philosophy.	1
Perhaps	1
policeman	1
is	1
a	1
relative	1
term.	1
In	1
an	1
evolutionary	1
sense,	1
sir,	1
the	1
ape	1
fades	1
so	1
gradually	1
into	1
the	1
policeman,	1
that	1
I	1
myself	1
can	1
never	1
detect	1
the	1
shade.	1
The	1
monkey	1
is	1
only	1
the	1
policeman	1
that	1
may	1
be.	1
Perhaps	1
a	1
maiden	1
lady	1
on	1
Clapham	1
Common	1
is	1
only	1
the	1
policeman	1
that	1
might	1
have	1
been.	1
I	1
don't	1
mind	1
being	1
the	1
policeman	1
that	1
might	1
have	1
been.	1
I	1
don't	1
mind	1
being	1
anything	1
in	1
German	1
thought."	1
"Are	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
police	1
service?"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
man,	1
ignoring	1
all	1
Syme's	1
improvised	1
and	1
desperate	1
raillery.	1
"Are	1
you	1
a	1
detective?"	1
Syme's	1
heart	1
turned	1
to	1
stone,	1
but	1
his	1
face	1
never	1
changed.	1
"Your	1
suggestion	1
is	1
ridiculous,"	1
he	1
began.	1
"Why	1
on	1
earth--"	1
The	1
old	1
man	1
struck	1
his	1
palsied	1
hand	1
passionately	1
on	1
the	1
rickety	1
table,	1
nearly	1
breaking	1
it.	1
"Did	1
you	1
hear	1
me	1
ask	1
a	1
plain	1
question,	1
you	1
pattering	1
spy?"	1
he	1
shrieked	1
in	1
a	1
high,	1
crazy	1
voice.	1
"Are	1
you,	1
or	1
are	1
you	1
not,	1
a	1
police	1
detective?"	1
"No!"	1
answered	1
Syme,	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
standing	1
on	1
the	1
hangman's	1
drop.	1
"You	1
swear	1
it,"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
man,	1
leaning	1
across	1
to	1
him,	1
his	1
dead	1
face	1
becoming	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
loathsomely	1
alive.	1
"You	1
swear	1
it!	1
You	1
swear	1
it!	1
If	1
you	1
swear	1
falsely,	1
will	1
you	1
be	1
damned?	1
Will	1
you	1
be	1
sure	1
that	1
the	1
devil	1
dances	1
at	1
your	1
funeral?	1
Will	1
you	1
see	1
that	1
the	1
nightmare	1
sits	1
on	1
your	1
grave?	1
Will	1
there	1
really	1
be	1
no	1
mistake?	1
You	1
are	1
an	1
anarchist,	1
you	1
are	1
a	1
dynamiter!	1
Above	1
all,	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
in	1
any	1
sense	1
a	1
detective?	1
You	1
are	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
British	1
police?"	1
He	1
leant	1
his	1
angular	1
elbow	1
far	1
across	1
the	1
table,	1
and	1
put	1
up	1
his	1
large	1
loose	1
hand	1
like	1
a	1
flap	1
to	1
his	1
ear.	1
"I	1
am	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
British	1
police,"	1
said	1
Syme	1
with	1
insane	1
calm.	1
Professor	1
de	1
Worms	1
fell	1
back	1
in	1
his	1
chair	1
with	1
a	1
curious	1
air	1
of	1
kindly	1
collapse.	1
"That's	1
a	1
pity,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"because	1
I	1
am."	1
Syme	1
sprang	1
up	1
straight,	1
sending	1
back	1
the	1
bench	1
behind	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
crash.	1
"Because	1
you	1
are	1
what?"	1
he	1
said	1
thickly.	1
"You	1
are	1
what?"	1
"I	1
am	1
a	1
policeman,"	1
said	1
the	1
Professor	1
with	1
his	1
first	1
broad	1
smile.	1
and	1
beaming	1
through	1
his	1
spectacles.	1
"But	1
as	1
you	1
think	1
policeman	1
only	1
a	1
relative	1
term,	1
of	1
course	1
I	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
you.	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
the	1
British	1
police	1
force;	1
but	1
as	1
you	1
tell	1
me	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
British	1
police	1
force,	1
I	1
can	1
only	1
say	1
that	1
I	1
met	1
you	1
in	1
a	1
dynamiters'	1
club.	1
I	1
suppose	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
arrest	1
you."	1
And	1
with	1
these	1
words	1
he	1
laid	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
before	1
Syme	1
an	1
exact	1
facsimile	1
of	1
the	1
blue	1
card	1
which	1
Syme	1
had	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
waistcoat	1
pocket,	1
the	1
symbol	1
of	1
his	1
power	1
from	1
the	1
police.	1
Syme	1
had	1
for	1
a	1
flash	1
the	1
sensation	1
that	1
the	1
cosmos	1
had	1
turned	1
exactly	1
upside	1
down,	1
that	1
all	1
trees	1
were	1
growing	1
downwards	1
and	1
that	1
all	1
stars	1
were	1
under	1
his	1
feet.	1
Then	1
came	1
slowly	1
the	1
opposite	1
conviction.	1
For	1
the	1
last	1
twenty-four	1
hours	1
the	1
cosmos	1
had	1
really	1
been	1
upside	1
down,	1
but	1
now	1
the	1
capsized	1
universe	1
had	1
come	1
right	1
side	1
up	1
again.	1
This	1
devil	1
from	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
fleeing	1
all	1
day	1
was	1
only	1
an	1
elder	1
brother	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
house,	1
who	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
table	1
lay	1
back	1
and	1
laughed	1
at	1
him.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
moment	1
ask	1
any	1
questions	1
of	1
detail;	1
he	1
only	1
knew	1
the	1
happy	1
and	1
silly	1
fact	1
that	1
this	1
shadow,	1
which	1
had	1
pursued	1
him	1
with	1
an	1
intolerable	1
oppression	1
of	1
peril,	1
was	1
only	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
a	1
friend	1
trying	1
to	1
catch	1
him	1
up.	1
He	1
knew	1
simultaneously	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
fool	1
and	1
a	1
free	1
man.	1
For	1
with	1
any	1
recovery	1
from	1
morbidity	1
there	1
must	1
go	1
a	1
certain	1
healthy	1
humiliation.	1
There	1
comes	1
a	1
certain	1
point	1
in	1
such	1
conditions	1
when	1
only	1
three	1
things	1
are	1
possible:	1
first	1
a	1
perpetuation	1
of	1
Satanic	1
pride,	1
secondly	1
tears,	1
and	1
third	1
laughter.	1
Syme's	1
egotism	1
held	1
hard	1
to	1
the	1
first	1
course	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
seconds,	1
and	1
then	1
suddenly	1
adopted	1
the	1
third.	1
Taking	1
his	1
own	1
blue	1
police	1
ticket	1
from	1
his	1
own	1
waist	1
coat	1
pocket,	1
he	1
tossed	1
it	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
table;	1
then	1
he	1
flung	1
his	1
head	1
back	1
until	1
his	1
spike	1
of	1
yellow	1
beard	1
almost	1
pointed	1
at	1
the	1
ceiling,	1
and	1
shouted	1
with	1
a	1
barbaric	1
laughter.	1
Even	1
in	1
that	1
close	1
den,	1
perpetually	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
din	1
of	1
knives,	1
plates,	1
cans,	1
clamorous	1
voices,	1
sudden	1
struggles	1
and	1
stampedes,	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
Homeric	1
in	1
Syme's	1
mirth	1
which	1
made	1
many	1
half-drunken	1
men	1
look	1
round.	1
"What	1
yer	1
laughing	1
at,	1
guv'nor?"	1
asked	1
one	1
wondering	1
labourer	1
from	1
the	1
docks.	1
"At	1
myself,"	1
answered	1
Syme,	1
and	1
went	1
off	1
again	1
into	1
the	1
agony	1
of	1
his	1
ecstatic	1
reaction.	1
"Pull	1
yourself	1
together,"	1
said	1
the	1
Professor,	1
"or	1
you'll	1
get	1
hysterical.	1
Have	1
some	1
more	1
beer.	1
I'll	1
join	1
you."	1
"You	1
haven't	1
drunk	1
your	1
milk,"	1
said	1
Syme.	1
"My	1
milk!"	1
said	1
the	1
other,	1
in	1
tones	1
of	1
withering	1
and	1
unfathomable	1
contempt,	1
"my	1
milk!	1
Do	1
you	1
think	1
I'd	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
beastly	1
stuff	1
when	1
I'm	1
out	1
of	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
bloody	1
anarchists?	1
We're	1
all	1
Christians	1
in	1
this	1
room,	1
though	1
perhaps,"	1
he	1
added,	1
glancing	1
around	1
at	1
the	1
reeling	1
crowd,	1
"not	1
strict	1
ones.	1
Finish	1
my	1
milk?	1
Great	1
blazes!	1
yes,	1
I'll	1
finish	1
it	1
right	1
enough!"	1
and	1
he	1
knocked	1
the	1
tumbler	1
off	1
the	1
table,	1
making	1
a	1
crash	1
of	1
glass	1
and	1
a	1
splash	1
of	1
silver	1
fluid.	1
Syme	1
was	1
staring	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
happy	1
curiosity.	1
"I	1
understand	1
now,"	1
he	1
cried;	1
"of	1
course,	1
you're	1
not	1
an	1
old	1
man	1
at	1
all."	1
"I	1
can't	1
take	1
my	1
face	1
off	1
here,"	1
replied	1
Professor	1
de	1
Worms.	1
"It's	1
rather	1
an	1
elaborate	1
make-up.	1
As	1
to	1
whether	1
I'm	1
an	1
old	1
man,	1
that's	1
not	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
say.	1
I	1
was	1
thirty-eight	1
last	1
birthday."	1
"Yes,	1
but	1
I	1
mean,"	1
said	1
Syme	1
impatiently,	1
"there's	1
nothing	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
you."	1
"Yes,"	1
answered	1
the	1
other	1
dispassionately.	1
"I	1
am	1
subject	1
to	1
colds."	1
Syme's	1
laughter	1
at	1
all	1
this	1
had	1
about	1
it	1
a	1
wild	1
weakness	1
of	1
relief.	1
He	1
laughed	1
at	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
the	1
paralytic	1
Professor	1
being	1
really	1
a	1
young	1
actor	1
dressed	1
up	1
as	1
if	1
for	1
the	1
foot-lights.	1
But	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
laughed	1
as	1
loudly	1
if	1
a	1
pepperpot	1
had	1
fallen	1
over.	1
The	1
false	1
Professor	1
drank	1
and	1
wiped	1
his	1
false	1
beard.	1
"Did	1
you	1
know,"	1
he	1
asked,	1
"that	1
that	1
man	1
Gogol	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
us?"	1
"I?	1
No,	1
I	1
didn't	1
know	1
it,"	1
answered	1
Syme	1
in	1
some	1
surprise.	1
"But	1
didn't	1
you?"	1
"I	1
knew	1
no	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
dead,"	1
replied	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
called	1
himself	1
de	1
Worms.	1
"I	1
thought	1
the	1
President	1
was	1
talking	1
about	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
rattled	1
in	1
my	1
boots."	1
"And	1
I	1
thought	1
he	1
was	1
talking	1
about	1
me,"	1
said	1
Syme,	1
with	1
his	1
rather	1
reckless	1
laughter.	1
"I	1
had	1
my	1
hand	1
on	1
my	1
revolver	1
all	1
the	1
time."	1
"So	1
had	1
I,"	1
said	1
the	1
Professor	1
grimly;	1
"so	1
had	1
Gogol	1
evidently."	1
Syme	1
struck	1
the	1
table	1
with	1
an	1
exclamation.	1
"Why,	1
there	1
were	1
three	1
of	1
us	1
there!"	1
he	1
cried.	1
"Three	1
out	1
of	1
seven	1
is	1
a	1
fighting	1
number.	1
If	1
we	1
had	1
only	1
known	1
that	1
we	1
were	1
three!"	1
The	1
face	1
of	1
Professor	1
de	1
Worms	1
darkened,	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
look	1
up.	1
"We	1
were	1
three,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"If	1
we	1
had	1
been	1
three	1
hundred	1
we	1
could	1
still	1
have	1
done	1
nothing."	1
"Not	1
if	1
we	1
were	1
three	1
hundred	1
against	1
four?"	1
asked	1
Syme,	1
jeering	1
rather	1
boisterously.	1
"No,"	1
said	1
the	1
Professor	1
with	1
sobriety,	1
"not	1
if	1
we	1
were	1
three	1
hundred	1
against	1
Sunday."	1
And	1
the	1
mere	1
name	1
struck	1
Syme	1
cold	1
and	1
serious;	1
his	1
laughter	1
had	1
died	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
before	1
it	1
could	1
die	1
on	1
his	1
lips.	1
The	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
unforgettable	1
President	1
sprang	1
into	1
his	1
mind	1
as	1
startling	1
as	1
a	1
coloured	1
photograph,	1
and	1
he	1
remarked	1
this	1
difference	1
between	1
Sunday	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
satellites,	1
that	1
their	1
faces,	1
however	1
fierce	1
or	1
sinister,	1
became	1
gradually	1
blurred	1
by	1
memory	1
like	1
other	1
human	1
faces,	1
whereas	1
Sunday's	1
seemed	1
almost	1
to	1
grow	1
more	1
actual	1
during	1
absence,	1
as	1
if	1
a	1
man's	1
painted	1
portrait	1
should	1
slowly	1
come	1
alive.	1
They	1
were	1
both	1
silent	1
for	1
a	1
measure	1
of	1
moments,	1
and	1
then	1
Syme's	1
speech	1
came	1
with	1
a	1
rush,	1
like	1
the	1
sudden	1
foaming	1
of	1
champagne.	1
"Professor,"	1
he	1
cried,	1
"it	1
is	1
intolerable.	1
Are	1
you	1
afraid	1
of	1
this	1
man?"	1
The	1
Professor	1
lifted	1
his	1
heavy	1
lids,	1
and	1
gazed	1
at	1
Syme	1
with	1
large,	1
wide-open,	1
blue	1
eyes	1
of	1
an	1
almost	1
ethereal	1
honesty.	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
am,"	1
he	1
said	1
mildly.	1
"So	1
are	1
you."	1
Syme	1
was	1
dumb	1
for	1
an	1
instant.	1
Then	1
he	1
rose	1
to	1
his	1
feet	1
erect,	1
like	1
an	1
insulted	1
man,	1
and	1
thrust	1
the	1
chair	1
away	1
from	1
him.	1
"Yes,"	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
indescribable,	1
"you	1
are	1
right.	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
of	1
him.	1
Therefore	1
I	1
swear	1
by	1
God	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
seek	1
out	1
this	1
man	1
whom	1
I	1
fear	1
until	1
I	1
find	1
him,	1
and	1
strike	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
mouth.	1
If	1
heaven	1
were	1
his	1
throne	1
and	1
the	1
earth	1
his	1
footstool,	1
I	1
swear	1
that	1
I	1
would	1
pull	1
him	1
down."	1
"How?"	1
asked	1
the	1
staring	1
Professor.	1
"Why?"	1
"Because	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
of	1
him,"	1
said	1
Syme;	1
"and	1
no	1
man	1
should	1
leave	1
in	1
the	1
universe	1
anything	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
is	1
afraid."	1
De	1
Worms	1
blinked	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
blind	1
wonder.	1
He	1
made	1
an	1
effort	1
to	1
speak,	1
but	1
Syme	1
went	1
on	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice,	1
but	1
with	1
an	1
undercurrent	1
of	1
inhuman	1
exaltation--	1
"Who	1
would	1
condescend	1
to	1
strike	1
down	1
the	1
mere	1
things	1
that	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
fear?	1
Who	1
would	1
debase	1
himself	1
to	1
be	1
merely	1
brave,	1
like	1
any	1
common	1
prizefighter?	1
Who	1
would	1
stoop	1
to	1
be	1
fearless--like	1
a	1
tree?	1
Fight	1
the	1
thing	1
that	1
you	1
fear.	1
You	1
remember	1
the	1
old	1
tale	1
of	1
the	1
English	1
clergyman	1
who	1
gave	1
the	1
last	1
rites	1
to	1
the	1
brigand	1
of	1
Sicily,	1
and	1
how	1
on	1
his	1
death-bed	1
the	1
great	1
robber	1
said,	1
'I	1
can	1
give	1
you	1
no	1
money,	1
but	1
I	1
can	1
give	1
you	1
advice	1
for	1
a	1
lifetime:	1
your	1
thumb	1
on	1
the	1
blade,	1
and	1
strike	1
upwards.'	1
So	1
I	1
say	1
to	1
you,	1
strike	1
upwards,	1
if	1
you	1
strike	1
at	1
the	1
stars."	1
The	1
other	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
ceiling,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
tricks	1
of	1
his	1
pose.	1
"Sunday	1
is	1
a	1
fixed	1
star,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"You	1
shall	1
see	1
him	1
a	1
falling	1
star,"	1
said	1
Syme,	1
and	1
put	1
on	1
his	1
hat.	1
The	1
decision	1
of	1
his	1
gesture	1
drew	1
the	1
Professor	1
vaguely	1
to	1
his	1
feet.	1
"Have	1
you	1
any	1
idea,"	1
he	1
asked,	1
with	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
benevolent	1
bewilderment,	1
"exactly	1
where	1
you	1
are	1
going?"	1
"Yes,"	1
replied	1
Syme	1
shortly,	1
"I	1
am	1
going	1
to	1
prevent	1
this	1
bomb	1
being	1
thrown	1
in	1
Paris."	1
"Have	1
you	1
any	1
conception	1
how?"	1
inquired	1
the	1
other.	1
"No,"	1
said	1
Syme	1
with	1
equal	1
decision.	1
"You	1
remember,	1
of	1
course,"	1
resumed	1
the	1
soi-disant	1
de	1
Worms,	1
pulling	1
his	1
beard	1
and	1
looking	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window,	1
"that	1
when	1
we	1
broke	1
up	1
rather	1
hurriedly	1
the	1
whole	1
arrangements	1
for	1
the	1
atrocity	1
were	1
left	1
in	1
the	1
private	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
Marquis	1
and	1
Dr.	1
Bull.	1
The	1
Marquis	1
is	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
probably	1
crossing	1
the	1
Channel.	1
But	1
where	1
he	1
will	1
go	1
and	1
what	1
he	1
will	1
do	1
it	1
is	1
doubtful	1
whether	1
even	1
the	1
President	1
knows;	1
certainly	1
we	1
don't	1
know.	1
The	1
only	1
man	1
who	1
does	1
know	1
is	1
Dr.	1
Bull.	1
"Confound	1
it!"	1
cried	1
Syme.	1
"And	1
we	1
don't	1
know	1
where	1
he	1
is."	1
"Yes,"	1
said	1
the	1
other	1
in	1
his	1
curious,	1
absent-minded	1
way,	1
"I	1
know	1
where	1
he	1
is	1
myself."	1
"Will	1
you	1
tell	1
me?"	1
asked	1
Syme	1
with	1
eager	1
eyes.	1
"I	1
will	1
take	1
you	1
there,"	1
said	1
the	1
Professor,	1
and	1
took	1
down	1
his	1
own	1
hat	1
from	1
a	1
peg.	1
Syme	1
stood	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
rigid	1
excitement.	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
mean?"	1
he	1
asked	1
sharply.	1
"Will	1
you	1
join	1
me?	1
Will	1
you	1
take	1
the	1
risk?"	1
"Young	1
man,"	1
said	1
the	1
Professor	1
pleasantly,	1
"I	1
am	1
amused	1
to	1
observe	1
that	1
you	1
think	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
coward.	1
As	1
to	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
say	1
only	1
one	1
word,	1
and	1
that	1
shall	1
be	1
entirely	1
in	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
your	1
own	1
philosophical	1
rhetoric.	1
You	1
think	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
possible	1
to	1
pull	1
down	1
the	1
President.	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
impossible,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
going	1
to	1
try	1
it,"	1
and	1
opening	1
the	1
tavern	1
door,	1
which	1
let	1
in	1
a	1
blast	1
of	1
bitter	1
air,	1
they	1
went	1
out	1
together	1
into	1
the	1
dark	1
streets	1
by	1
the	1
docks.	1
Most	1
of	1
the	1
snow	1
was	1
melted	1
or	1
trampled	1
to	1
mud,	1
but	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
a	1
clot	1
of	1
it	1
still	1
showed	1
grey	1
rather	1
than	1
white	1
in	1
the	1
gloom.	1
The	1
small	1
streets	1
were	1
sloppy	1
and	1
full	1
of	1
pools,	1
which	1
reflected	1
the	1
flaming	1
lamps	1
irregularly,	1
and	1
by	1
accident,	1
like	1
fragments	1
of	1
some	1
other	1
and	1
fallen	1
world.	1
Syme	1
felt	1
almost	1
dazed	1
as	1
he	1
stepped	1
through	1
this	1
growing	1
confusion	1
of	1
lights	1
and	1
shadows;	1
but	1
his	1
companion	1
walked	1
on	1
with	1
a	1
certain	1
briskness,	1
towards	1
where,	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
street,	1
an	1
inch	1
or	1
two	1
of	1
the	1
lamplit	1
river	1
looked	1
like	1
a	1
bar	1
of	1
flame.	1
"Where	1
are	1
you	1
going?"	1
Syme	1
inquired.	1
"Just	1
now,"	1
answered	1
the	1
Professor,	1
"I	1
am	1
going	1
just	1
round	1
the	1
corner	1
to	1
see	1
whether	1
Dr.	1
Bull	1
has	1
gone	1
to	1
bed.	1
He	1
is	1
hygienic,	1
and	1
retires	1
early."	1
"Dr.	1
Bull!"	1
exclaimed	1
Syme.	1
"Does	1
he	1
live	1
round	1
the	1
corner?"	1
"No,"	1
answered	1
his	1
friend.	1
"As	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
fact	1
he	1
lives	1
some	1
way	1
off,	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
river,	1
but	1
we	1
can	1
tell	1
from	1
here	1
whether	1
he	1
has	1
gone	1
to	1
bed."	1
Turning	1
the	1
corner	1
as	1
he	1
spoke,	1
and	1
facing	1
the	1
dim	1
river,	1
flecked	1
with	1
flame,	1
he	1
pointed	1
with	1
his	1
stick	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
bank.	1
On	1
the	1
Surrey	1
side	1
at	1
this	1
point	1
there	1
ran	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
Thames,	1
seeming	1
almost	1
to	1
overhang	1
it,	1
a	1
bulk	1
and	1
cluster	1
of	1
those	1
tall	1
tenements,	1
dotted	1
with	1
lighted	1
windows,	1
and	1
rising	1
like	1
factory	1
chimneys	1
to	1
an	1
almost	1
insane	1
height.	1
Their	1
special	1
poise	1
and	1
position	1
made	1
one	1
block	1
of	1
buildings	1
especially	1
look	1
like	1
a	1
Tower	1
of	1
Babel	1
with	1
a	1
hundred	1
eyes.	1
Syme	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
sky-scraping	1
buildings	1
in	1
America,	1
so	1
he	1
could	1
only	1
think	1
of	1
the	1
buildings	1
in	1
a	1
dream.	1
Even	1
as	1
he	1
stared,	1
the	1
highest	1
light	1
in	1
this	1
innumerably	1
lighted	1
turret	1
abruptly	1
went	1
out,	1
as	1
if	1
this	1
black	1
Argus	1
had	1
winked	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
innumerable	1
eyes.	1
Professor	1
de	1
Worms	1
swung	1
round	1
on	1
his	1
heel,	1
and	1
struck	1
his	1
stick	1
against	1
his	1
boot.	1
"We	1
are	1
too	1
late,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"the	1
hygienic	1
Doctor	1
has	1
gone	1
to	1
bed."	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
mean?"	1
asked	1
Syme.	1
"Does	1
he	1
live	1
over	1
there,	1
then?"	1
"Yes,"	1
said	1
de	1
Worms,	1
"behind	1
that	1
particular	1
window	1
which	1
you	1
can't	1
see.	1
Come	1
along	1
and	1
get	1
some	1
dinner.	1
We	1
must	1
call	1
on	1
him	1
tomorrow	1
morning."	1
Without	1
further	1
parley,	1
he	1
led	1
the	1
way	1
through	1
several	1
by-ways	1
until	1
they	1
came	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
flare	1
and	1
clamour	1
of	1
the	1
East	1
India	1
Dock	1
Road.	1
The	1
Professor,	1
who	1
seemed	1
to	1
know	1
his	1
way	1
about	1
the	1
neighbourhood,	1
proceeded	1
to	1
a	1
place	1
where	1
the	1
line	1
of	1
lighted	1
shops	1
fell	1
back	1
into	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
abrupt	1
twilight	1
and	1
quiet,	1
in	1
which	1
an	1
old	1
white	1
inn,	1
all	1
out	1
of	1
repair,	1
stood	1
back	1
some	1
twenty	1
feet	1
from	1
the	1
road.	1
"You	1
can	1
find	1
good	1
English	1
inns	1
left	1
by	1
accident	1
everywhere,	1
like	1
fossils,"	1
explained	1
the	1
Professor.	1
"I	1
once	1
found	1
a	1
decent	1
place	1
in	1
the	1
West	1
End."	1
"I	1
suppose,"	1
said	1
Syme,	1
smiling,	1
"that	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
corresponding	1
decent	1
place	1
in	1
the	1
East	1
End?"	1
"It	1
is,"	1
said	1
the	1
Professor	1
reverently,	1
and	1
went	1
in.	1
In	1
that	1
place	1
they	1
dined	1
and	1
slept,	1
both	1
very	1
thoroughly.	1
The	1
beans	1
and	1
bacon,	1
which	1
these	1
unaccountable	1
people	1
cooked	1
well,	1
the	1
astonishing	1
emergence	1
of	1
Burgundy	1
from	1
their	1
cellars,	1
crowned	1
Syme's	1
sense	1
of	1
a	1
new	1
comradeship	1
and	1
comfort.	1
Through	1
all	1
this	1
ordeal	1
his	1
root	1
horror	1
had	1
been	1
isolation,	1
and	1
there	1
are	1
no	1
words	1
to	1
express	1
the	1
abyss	1
between	1
isolation	1
and	1
having	1
one	1
ally.	1
It	1
may	1
be	1
conceded	1
to	1
the	1
mathematicians	1
that	1
four	1
is	1
twice	1
two.	1
But	1
two	1
is	1
not	1
twice	1
one;	1
two	1
is	1
two	1
thousand	1
times	1
one.	1
That	1
is	1
why,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
a	1
hundred	1
disadvantages,	1
the	1
world	1
will	1
always	1
return	1
to	1
monogamy.	1
Syme	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
pour	1
out	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
his	1
outrageous	1
tale,	1
from	1
the	1
time	1
when	1
Gregory	1
had	1
taken	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
little	1
tavern	1
by	1
the	1
river.	1
He	1
did	1
it	1
idly	1
and	1
amply,	1
in	1
a	1
luxuriant	1
monologue,	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
speaks	1
with	1
very	1
old	1
friends.	1
On	1
his	1
side,	1
also,	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
impersonated	1
Professor	1
de	1
Worms	1
was	1
not	1
less	1
communicative.	1
His	1
own	1
story	1
was	1
almost	1
as	1
silly	1
as	1
Syme's.	1
"That's	1
a	1
good	1
get-up	1
of	1
yours,"	1
said	1
Syme,	1
draining	1
a	1
glass	1
of	1
Macon;	1
"a	1
lot	1
better	1
than	1
old	1
Gogol's.	1
Even	1
at	1
the	1
start	1
I	1
thought	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
bit	1
too	1
hairy."	1
"A	1
difference	1
of	1
artistic	1
theory,"	1
replied	1
the	1
Professor	1
pensively.	1
"Gogol	1
was	1
an	1
idealist.	1
He	1
made	1
up	1
as	1
the	1
abstract	1
or	1
platonic	1
ideal	1
of	1
an	1
anarchist.	1
But	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
realist.	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
portrait	1
painter.	1
But,	1
indeed,	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
portrait	1
painter	1
is	1
an	1
inadequate	1
expression.	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
portrait."	1
"I	1
don't	1
understand	1
you,"	1
said	1
Syme.	1
"I	1
am	1
a	1
portrait,"	1
repeated	1
the	1
Professor.	1
"I	1
am	1
a	1
portrait	1
of	1
the	1
celebrated	1
Professor	1
de	1
Worms,	1
who	1
is,	1
I	1
believe,	1
in	1
Naples."	1
"You	1
mean	1
you	1
are	1
made	1
up	1
like	1
him,"	1
said	1
Syme.	1
"But	1
doesn't	1
he	1
know	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
taking	1
his	1
nose	1
in	1
vain?"	1
"He	1
knows	1
it	1
right	1
enough,"	1
replied	1
his	1
friend	1
cheerfully.	1
"Then	1
why	1
doesn't	1
he	1
denounce	1
you?"	1
"I	1
have	1
denounced	1
him,"	1
answered	1
the	1
Professor.	1
"Do	1
explain	1
yourself,"	1
said	1
Syme.	1
"With	1
pleasure,	1
if	1
you	1
don't	1
mind	1
hearing	1
my	1
story,"	1
replied	1
the	1
eminent	1
foreign	1
philosopher.	1
"I	1
am	1
by	1
profession	1
an	1
actor,	1
and	1
my	1
name	1
is	1
Wilks.	1
When	1
I	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
stage	1
I	1
mixed	1
with	1
all	1
sorts	1
of	1
Bohemian	1
and	1
blackguard	1
company.	1
Sometimes	1
I	1
touched	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
turf,	1
sometimes	1
the	1
riff-raff	1
of	1
the	1
arts,	1
and	1
occasionally	1
the	1
political	1
refugee.	1
In	1
some	1
den	1
of	1
exiled	1
dreamers	1
I	1
was	1
introduced	1
to	1
the	1
great	1
German	1
Nihilist	1
philosopher,	1
Professor	1
de	1
Worms.	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
gather	1
much	1
about	1
him	1
beyond	1
his	1
appearance,	1
which	1
was	1
very	1
disgusting,	1
and	1
which	1
I	1
studied	1
carefully.	1
I	1
understood	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
proved	1
that	1
the	1
destructive	1
principle	1
in	1
the	1
universe	1
was	1
God;	1
hence	1
he	1
insisted	1
on	1
the	1
need	1
for	1
a	1
furious	1
and	1
incessant	1
energy,	1
rending	1
all	1
things	1
in	1
pieces.	1
Energy,	1
he	1
said,	1
was	1
the	1
All.	1
He	1
was	1
lame,	1
shortsighted,	1
and	1
partially	1
paralytic.	1
When	1
I	1
met	1
him	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
frivolous	1
mood,	1
and	1
I	1
disliked	1
him	1
so	1
much	1
that	1
I	1
resolved	1
to	1
imitate	1
him.	1
If	1
I	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
draughtsman	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
drawn	1
a	1
caricature.	1
I	1
was	1
only	1
an	1
actor,	1
I	1
could	1
only	1
act	1
a	1
caricature.	1
I	1
made	1
myself	1
up	1
into	1
what	1
was	1
meant	1
for	1
a	1
wild	1
exaggeration	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
Professor's	1
dirty	1
old	1
self.	1
When	1
I	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
full	1
of	1
his	1
supporters	1
I	1
expected	1
to	1
be	1
received	1
with	1
a	1
roar	1
of	1
laughter,	1
or	1
(if	1
they	1
were	1
too	1
far	1
gone)	1
with	1
a	1
roar	1
of	1
indignation	1
at	1
the	1
insult.	1
I	1
cannot	1
describe	1
the	1
surprise	1
I	1
felt	1
when	1
my	1
entrance	1
was	1
received	1
with	1
a	1
respectful	1
silence,	1
followed	1
(when	1
I	1
had	1
first	1
opened	1
my	1
lips)	1
with	1
a	1
murmur	1
of	1
admiration.	1
The	1
curse	1
of	1
the	1
perfect	1
artist	1
had	1
fallen	1
upon	1
me.	1
I	1
had	1
been	1
too	1
subtle,	1
I	1
had	1
been	1
too	1
true.	1
They	1
thought	1
I	1
really	1
was	1
the	1
great	1
Nihilist	1
Professor.	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
healthy-minded	1
young	1
man	1
at	1
the	1
time,	1
and	1
I	1
confess	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
blow.	1
Before	1
I	1
could	1
fully	1
recover,	1
however,	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
of	1
these	1
admirers	1
ran	1
up	1
to	1
me	1
radiating	1
indignation,	1
and	1
told	1
me	1
that	1
a	1
public	1
insult	1
had	1
been	1
put	1
upon	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
next	1
room.	1
I	1
inquired	1
its	1
nature.	1
It	1
seemed	1
that	1
an	1
impertinent	1
fellow	1
had	1
dressed	1
himself	1
up	1
as	1
a	1
preposterous	1
parody	1
of	1
myself.	1
I	1
had	1
drunk	1
more	1
champagne	1
than	1
was	1
good	1
for	1
me,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
flash	1
of	1
folly	1
I	1
decided	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
situation	1
through.	1
Consequently	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
meet	1
the	1
glare	1
of	1
the	1
company	1
and	1
my	1
own	1
lifted	1
eyebrows	1
and	1
freezing	1
eyes	1
that	1
the	1
real	1
Professor	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
room.	1
"I	1
need	1
hardly	1
say	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
collision.	1
The	1
pessimists	1
all	1
round	1
me	1
looked	1
anxiously	1
from	1
one	1
Professor	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
Professor	1
to	1
see	1
which	1
was	1
really	1
the	1
more	1
feeble.	1
But	1
I	1
won.	1
An	1
old	1
man	1
in	1
poor	1
health,	1
like	1
my	1
rival,	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
expected	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
impressively	1
feeble	1
as	1
a	1
young	1
actor	1
in	1
the	1
prime	1
of	1
life.	1
You	1
see,	1
he	1
really	1
had	1
paralysis,	1
and	1
working	1
within	1
this	1
definite	1
limitation,	1
he	1
couldn't	1
be	1
so	1
jolly	1
paralytic	1
as	1
I	1
was.	1
Then	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
blast	1
my	1
claims	1
intellectually.	1
I	1
countered	1
that	1
by	1
a	1
very	1
simple	1
dodge.	1
Whenever	1
he	1
said	1
something	1
that	1
nobody	1
but	1
he	1
could	1
understand,	1
I	1
replied	1
with	1
something	1
which	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
even	1
understand	1
myself.	1
'I	1
don't	1
fancy,'	1
he	1
said,	1
'that	1
you	1
could	1
have	1
worked	1
out	1
the	1
principle	1
that	1
evolution	1
is	1
only	1
negation,	1
since	1
there	1
inheres	1
in	1
it	1
the	1
introduction	1
of	1
lacuna,	1
which	1
are	1
an	1
essential	1
of	1
differentiation.'	1
I	1
replied	1
quite	1
scornfully,	1
'You	1
read	1
all	1
that	1
up	1
in	1
Pinckwerts;	1
the	1
notion	1
that	1
involution	1
functioned	1
eugenically	1
was	1
exposed	1
long	1
ago	1
by	1
Glumpe.'	1
It	1
is	1
unnecessary	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
there	1
never	1
were	1
such	1
people	1
as	1
Pinckwerts	1
and	1
Glumpe.	1
But	1
the	1
people	1
all	1
round	1
(rather	1
to	1
my	1
surprise)	1
seemed	1
to	1
remember	1
them	1
quite	1
well,	1
and	1
the	1
Professor,	1
finding	1
that	1
the	1
learned	1
and	1
mysterious	1
method	1
left	1
him	1
rather	1
at	1
the	1
mercy	1
of	1
an	1
enemy	1
slightly	1
deficient	1
in	1
scruples,	1
fell	1
back	1
upon	1
a	1
more	1
popular	1
form	1
of	1
wit.	1
'I	1
see,'	1
he	1
sneered,	1
'you	1
prevail	1
like	1
the	1
false	1
pig	1
in	1
Aesop.'	1
'And	1
you	1
fail,'	1
I	1
answered,	1
smiling,	1
'like	1
the	1
hedgehog	1
in	1
Montaigne.'	1
Need	1
I	1
say	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
hedgehog	1
in	1
Montaigne?	1
'Your	1
claptrap	1
comes	1
off,'	1
he	1
said;	1
'so	1
would	1
your	1
beard.'	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
intelligent	1
answer	1
to	1
this,	1
which	1
was	1
quite	1
true	1
and	1
rather	1
witty.	1
But	1
I	1
laughed	1
heartily,	1
answered,	1
'Like	1
the	1
Pantheist's	1
boots,'	1
at	1
random,	1
and	1
turned	1
on	1
my	1
heel	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
honours	1
of	1
victory.	1
The	1
real	1
Professor	1
was	1
thrown	1
out,	1
but	1
not	1
with	1
violence,	1
though	1
one	1
man	1
tried	1
very	1
patiently	1
to	1
pull	1
off	1
his	1
nose.	1
He	1
is	1
now,	1
I	1
believe,	1
received	1
everywhere	1
in	1
Europe	1
as	1
a	1
delightful	1
impostor.	1
His	1
apparent	1
earnestness	1
and	1
anger,	1
you	1
see,	1
make	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
more	1
entertaining."	1
"Well,"	1
said	1
Syme,	1
"I	1
can	1
understand	1
your	1
putting	1
on	1
his	1
dirty	1
old	1
beard	1
for	1
a	1
night's	1
practical	1
joke,	1
but	1
I	1
don't	1
understand	1
your	1
never	1
taking	1
it	1
off	1
again."	1
"That	1
is	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
story,"	1
said	1
the	1
impersonator.	1
"When	1
I	1
myself	1
left	1
the	1
company,	1
followed	1
by	1
reverent	1
applause,	1
I	1
went	1
limping	1
down	1
the	1
dark	1
street,	1
hoping	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
soon	1
be	1
far	1
enough	1
away	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
walk	1
like	1
a	1
human	1
being.	1
To	1
my	1
astonishment,	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
turning	1
the	1
corner,	1
I	1
felt	1
a	1
touch	1
on	1
the	1
shoulder,	1
and	1
turning,	1
found	1
myself	1
under	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
an	1
enormous	1
policeman.	1
He	1
told	1
me	1
I	1
was	1
wanted.	1
I	1
struck	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
paralytic	1
attitude,	1
and	1
cried	1
in	1
a	1
high	1
German	1
accent,	1
'Yes,	1
I	1
am	1
wanted--by	1
the	1
oppressed	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
You	1
are	1
arresting	1
me	1
on	1
the	1
charge	1
of	1
being	1
the	1
great	1
anarchist,	1
Professor	1
de	1
Worms.'	1
The	1
policeman	1
impassively	1
consulted	1
a	1
paper	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
'No,	1
sir,'	1
he	1
said	1
civilly,	1
'at	1
least,	1
not	1
exactly,	1
sir.	1
I	1
am	1
arresting	1
you	1
on	1
the	1
charge	1
of	1
not	1
being	1
the	1
celebrated	1
anarchist,	1
Professor	1
de	1
Worms.'	1
This	1
charge,	1
if	1
it	1
was	1
criminal	1
at	1
all,	1
was	1
certainly	1
the	1
lighter	1
of	1
the	1
two,	1
and	1
I	1
went	1
along	1
with	1
the	1
man,	1
doubtful,	1
but	1
not	1
greatly	1
dismayed.	1
I	1
was	1
shown	1
into	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
rooms,	1
and	1
eventually	1
into	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
a	1
police	1
officer,	1
who	1
explained	1
that	1
a	1
serious	1
campaign	1
had	1
been	1
opened	1
against	1
the	1
centres	1
of	1
anarchy,	1
and	1
that	1
this,	1
my	1
successful	1
masquerade,	1
might	1
be	1
of	1
considerable	1
value	1
to	1
the	1
public	1
safety.	1
He	1
offered	1
me	1
a	1
good	1
salary	1
and	1
this	1
little	1
blue	1
card.	1
Though	1
our	1
conversation	1
was	1
short,	1
he	1
struck	1
me	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
very	1
massive	1
common	1
sense	1
and	1
humour;	1
but	1
I	1
cannot	1
tell	1
you	1
much	1
about	1
him	1
personally,	1
because--"	1
Syme	1
laid	1
down	1
his	1
knife	1
and	1
fork.	1
"I	1
know,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"because	1
you	1
talked	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
dark	1
room."	1
Professor	1
de	1
Worms	1
nodded	1
and	1
drained	1
his	1
glass.	1
CHAPTER	1
IX	1
THE	1
MAN	1
IN	1
SPECTACLES	1
"BURGUNDY	1
is	1
a	1
jolly	1
thing,"	1
said	1
the	1
Professor	1
sadly,	1
as	1
he	1
set	1
his	1
glass	1
down.	1
"You	1
don't	1
look	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were,"	1
said	1
Syme;	1
"you	1
drink	1
it	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
medicine."	1
"You	1
must	1
excuse	1
my	1
manner,"	1
said	1
the	1
Professor	1
dismally,	1
"my	1
position	1
is	1
rather	1
a	1
curious	1
one.	1
Inside	1
I	1
am	1
really	1
bursting	1
with	1
boyish	1
merriment;	1
but	1
I	1
acted	1
the	1
paralytic	1
Professor	1
so	1
well,	1
that	1
now	1
I	1
can't	1
leave	1
off.	1
So	1
that	1
when	1
I	1
am	1
among	1
friends,	1
and	1
have	1
no	1
need	1
at	1
all	1
to	1
disguise	1
myself,	1
I	1
still	1
can't	1
help	1
speaking	1
slow	1
and	1
wrinkling	1
my	1
forehead--just	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
my	1
forehead.	1
I	1
can	1
be	1
quite	1
happy,	1
you	1
understand,	1
but	1
only	1
in	1
a	1
paralytic	1
sort	1
of	1
way.	1
The	1
most	1
buoyant	1
exclamations	1
leap	1
up	1
in	1
my	1
heart,	1
but	1
they	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
mouth	1
quite	1
different.	1
You	1
should	1
hear	1
me	1
say,	1
'Buck	1
up,	1
old	1
cock!'	1
It	1
would	1
bring	1
tears	1
to	1
your	1
eyes."	1
"It	1
does,"	1
said	1
Syme;	1
"but	1
I	1
cannot	1
help	1
thinking	1
that	1
apart	1
from	1
all	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
really	1
a	1
bit	1
worried."	1
The	1
Professor	1
started	1
a	1
little	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
steadily.	1
"You	1
are	1
a	1
very	1
clever	1
fellow,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"it	1
is	1
a	1
pleasure	1
to	1
work	1
with	1
you.	1
Yes,	1
I	1
have	1
rather	1
a	1
heavy	1
cloud	1
in	1
my	1
head.	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
problem	1
to	1
face,"	1
and	1
he	1
sank	1
his	1
bald	1
brow	1
in	1
his	1
two	1
hands.	1
Then	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice--	1
"Can	1
you	1
play	1
the	1
piano?"	1
"Yes,"	1
said	1
Syme	1
in	1
simple	1
wonder,	1
"I'm	1
supposed	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
good	1
touch."	1
Then,	1
as	1
the	1
other	1
did	1
not	1
speak,	1
he	1
added--	1
"I	1
trust	1
the	1
great	1
cloud	1
is	1
lifted."	1
After	1
a	1
long	1
silence,	1
the	1
Professor	1
said	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
cavernous	1
shadow	1
of	1
his	1
hands--	1
"It	1
would	1
have	1
done	1
just	1
as	1
well	1
if	1
you	1
could	1
work	1
a	1
typewriter."	1
"Thank	1
you,"	1
said	1
Syme,	1
"you	1
flatter	1
me."	1
"Listen	1
to	1
me,"	1
said	1
the	1
other,	1
"and	1
remember	1
whom	1
we	1
have	1
to	1
see	1
tomorrow.	1
You	1
and	1
I	1
are	1
going	1
tomorrow	1
to	1
attempt	1
something	1
which	1
is	1
very	1
much	1
more	1
dangerous	1
than	1
trying	1
to	1
steal	1
the	1
Crown	1
Jewels	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
Tower.	1
We	1
are	1
trying	1
to	1
steal	1
a	1
secret	1
from	1
a	1
very	1
sharp,	1
very	1
strong,	1
and	1
very	1
wicked	1
man.	1
I	1
believe	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
man,	1
except	1
the	1
President,	1
of	1
course,	1
who	1
is	1
so	1
seriously	1
startling	1
and	1
formidable	1
as	1
that	1
little	1
grinning	1
fellow	1
in	1
goggles.	1
He	1
has	1
not	1
perhaps	1
the	1
white-hot	1
enthusiasm	1
unto	1
death,	1
the	1
mad	1
martyrdom	1
for	1
anarchy,	1
which	1
marks	1
the	1
Secretary.	1
But	1
then	1
that	1
very	1
fanaticism	1
in	1
the	1
Secretary	1
has	1
a	1
human	1
pathos,	1
and	1
is	1
almost	1
a	1
redeeming	1
trait.	1
But	1
the	1
little	1
Doctor	1
has	1
a	1
brutal	1
sanity	1
that	1
is	1
more	1
shocking	1
than	1
the	1
Secretary's	1
disease.	1
Don't	1
you	1
notice	1
his	1
detestable	1
virility	1
and	1
vitality.	1
He	1
bounces	1
like	1
an	1
india-rubber	1
ball.	1
Depend	1
on	1
it,	1
Sunday	1
was	1
not	1
asleep	1
(I	1
wonder	1
if	1
he	1
ever	1
sleeps?)	1
when	1
he	1
locked	1
up	1
all	1
the	1
plans	1
of	1
this	1
outrage	1
in	1
the	1
round,	1
black	1
head	1
of	1
Dr.	1
Bull."	1
"And	1
you	1
think,"	1
said	1
Syme,	1
"that	1
this	1
unique	1
monster	1
will	1
be	1
soothed	1
if	1
I	1
play	1
the	1
piano	1
to	1
him?"	1
"Don't	1
be	1
an	1
ass,"	1
said	1
his	1
mentor.	1
"I	1
mentioned	1
the	1
piano	1
because	1
it	1
gives	1
one	1
quick	1
and	1
independent	1
fingers.	1
Syme,	1
if	1
we	1
are	1
to	1
go	1
through	1
this	1
interview	1
and	1
come	1
out	1
sane	1
or	1
alive,	1
we	1
must	1
have	1
some	1
code	1
of	1
signals	1
between	1
us	1
that	1
this	1
brute	1
will	1
not	1
see.	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
a	1
rough	1
alphabetical	1
cypher	1
corresponding	1
to	1
the	1
five	1
fingers--like	1
this,	1
see,"	1
and	1
he	1
rippled	1
with	1
his	1
fingers	1
on	1
the	1
wooden	1
table--"B	1
A	1
D,	1
bad,	1
a	1
word	1
we	1
may	1
frequently	1
require."	1
Syme	1
poured	1
himself	1
out	1
another	1
glass	1
of	1
wine,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
study	1
the	1
scheme.	1
He	1
was	1
abnormally	1
quick	1
with	1
his	1
brains	1
at	1
puzzles,	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
hands	1
at	1
conjuring,	1
and	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
take	1
him	1
long	1
to	1
learn	1
how	1
he	1
might	1
convey	1
simple	1
messages	1
by	1
what	1
would	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
idle	1
taps	1
upon	1
a	1
table	1
or	1
knee.	1
But	1
wine	1
and	1
companionship	1
had	1
always	1
the	1
effect	1
of	1
inspiring	1
him	1
to	1
a	1
farcical	1
ingenuity,	1
and	1
the	1
Professor	1
soon	1
found	1
himself	1
struggling	1
with	1
the	1
too	1
vast	1
energy	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
language,	1
as	1
it	1
passed	1
through	1
the	1
heated	1
brain	1
of	1
Syme.	1
"We	1
must	1
have	1
several	1
word-signs,"	1
said	1
Syme	1
seriously--"words	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
likely	1
to	1
want,	1
fine	1
shades	1
of	1
meaning.	1
My	1
favourite	1
word	1
is	1
'coeval'.	1
What's	1
yours?"	1
"Do	1
stop	1
playing	1
the	1
goat,"	1
said	1
the	1
Professor	1
plaintively.	1
"You	1
don't	1
know	1
how	1
serious	1
this	1
is."	1
"'Lush'	1
too,"	1
said	1
Syme,	1
shaking	1
his	1
head	1
sagaciously,	1
"we	1
must	1
have	1
'lush'--word	1
applied	1
to	1
grass,	1
don't	1
you	1
know?"	1
"Do	1
you	1
imagine,"	1
asked	1
the	1
Professor	1
furiously,	1
"that	1
we	1
are	1
going	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
Dr.	1
Bull	1
about	1
grass?"	1
"There	1
are	1
several	1
ways	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
subject	1
could	1
be	1
approached,"	1
said	1
Syme	1
reflectively,	1
"and	1
the	1
word	1
introduced	1
without	1
appearing	1
forced.	1
We	1
might	1
say,	1
'Dr.	1
Bull,	1
as	1
a	1
revolutionist,	1
you	1
remember	1
that	1
a	1
tyrant	1
once	1
advised	1
us	1
to	1
eat	1
grass;	1
and	1
indeed	1
many	1
of	1
us,	1
looking	1
on	1
the	1
fresh	1
lush	1
grass	1
of	1
summer"'	1
"Do	1
you	1
understand,"	1
said	1
the	1
other,	1
"that	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
tragedy?"	1
"Perfectly,"	1
replied	1
Syme;	1
"always	1
be	1
comic	1
in	1
a	1
tragedy.	1
What	1
the	1
deuce	1
else	1
can	1
you	1
do?	1
I	1
wish	1
this	1
language	1
of	1
yours	1
had	1
a	1
wider	1
scope.	1
I	1
suppose	1
we	1
could	1
not	1
extend	1
it	1
from	1
the	1
fingers	1
to	1
the	1
toes?	1
That	1
would	1
involve	1
pulling	1
off	1
our	1
boots	1
and	1
socks	1
during	1
the	1
conversation,	1
which	1
however	1
unobtrusively	1
performed--"	1
"Syme,"	1
said	1
his	1
friend	1
with	1
a	1
stern	1
simplicity,	1
"go	1
to	1
bed!"	1
Syme,	1
however,	1
sat	1
up	1
in	1
bed	1
for	1
a	1
considerable	1
time	1
mastering	1
the	1
new	1
code.	1
He	1
was	1
awakened	1
next	1
morning	1
while	1
the	1
east	1
was	1
still	1
sealed	1
with	1
darkness,	1
and	1
found	1
his	1
grey-bearded	1
ally	1
standing	1
like	1
a	1
ghost	1
beside	1
his	1
bed.	1
Syme	1
sat	1
up	1
in	1
bed	1
blinking;	1
then	1
slowly	1
collected	1
his	1
thoughts,	1
threw	1
off	1
the	1
bed-clothes,	1
and	1
stood	1
up.	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
some	1
curious	1
way	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
safety	1
and	1
sociability	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
before	1
fell	1
with	1
the	1
bedclothes	1
off	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
stood	1
up	1
in	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
cold	1
danger.	1
He	1
still	1
felt	1
an	1
entire	1
trust	1
and	1
loyalty	1
towards	1
his	1
companion;	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
trust	1
between	1
two	1
men	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
scaffold.	1
"Well,"	1
said	1
Syme	1
with	1
a	1
forced	1
cheerfulness	1
as	1
he	1
pulled	1
on	1
his	1
trousers,	1
"I	1
dreamt	1
of	1
that	1
alphabet	1
of	1
yours.	1
Did	1
it	1
take	1
you	1
long	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
up?"	1
The	1
Professor	1
made	1
no	1
answer,	1
but	1
gazed	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
him	1
with	1
eyes	1
the	1
colour	1
of	1
a	1
wintry	1
sea;	1
so	1
Syme	1
repeated	1
his	1
question.	1
"I	1
say,	1
did	1
it	1
take	1
you	1
long	1
to	1
invent	1
all	1
this?	1
I'm	1
considered	1
good	1
at	1
these	1
things,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
good	1
hour's	1
grind.	1
Did	1
you	1
learn	1
it	1
all	1
on	1
the	1
spot?"	1
The	1
Professor	1
was	1
silent;	1
his	1
eyes	1
were	1
wide	1
open,	1
and	1
he	1
wore	1
a	1
fixed	1
but	1
very	1
small	1
smile.	1
"How	1
long	1
did	1
it	1
take	1
you?"	1
The	1
Professor	1
did	1
not	1
move.	1
"Confound	1
you,	1
can't	1
you	1
answer?"	1
called	1
out	1
Syme,	1
in	1
a	1
sudden	1
anger	1
that	1
had	1
something	1
like	1
fear	1
underneath.	1
Whether	1
or	1
no	1
the	1
Professor	1
could	1
answer,	1
he	1
did	1
not.	1
Syme	1
stood	1
staring	1
back	1
at	1
the	1
stiff	1
face	1
like	1
parchment	1
and	1
the	1
blank,	1
blue	1
eyes.	1
His	1
first	1
thought	1
was	1
that	1
the	1
Professor	1
had	1
gone	1
mad,	1
but	1
his	1
second	1
thought	1
was	1
more	1
frightful.	1
After	1
all,	1
what	1
did	1
he	1
know	1
about	1
this	1
queer	1
creature	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
heedlessly	1
accepted	1
as	1
a	1
friend?	1
What	1
did	1
he	1
know,	1
except	1
that	1
the	1
man	1
had	1
been	1
at	1
the	1
anarchist	1
breakfast	1
and	1
had	1
told	1
him	1
a	1
ridiculous	1
tale?	1
How	1
improbable	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
another	1
friend	1
there	1
beside	1
Gogol!	1
Was	1
this	1
man's	1
silence	1
a	1
sensational	1
way	1
of	1
declaring	1
war?	1
Was	1
this	1
adamantine	1
stare	1
after	1
all	1
only	1
the	1
awful	1
sneer	1
of	1
some	1
threefold	1
traitor,	1
who	1
had	1
turned	1
for	1
the	1
last	1
time?	1
He	1
stood	1
and	1
strained	1
his	1
ears	1
in	1
this	1
heartless	1
silence.	1
He	1
almost	1
fancied	1
he	1
could	1
hear	1
dynamiters	1
come	1
to	1
capture	1
him	1
shifting	1
softly	1
in	1
the	1
corridor	1
outside.	1
Then	1
his	1
eye	1
strayed	1
downwards,	1
and	1
he	1
burst	1
out	1
laughing.	1
Though	1
the	1
Professor	1
himself	1
stood	1
there	1
as	1
voiceless	1
as	1
a	1
statue,	1
his	1
five	1
dumb	1
fingers	1
were	1
dancing	1
alive	1
upon	1
the	1
dead	1
table.	1
Syme	1
watched	1
the	1
twinkling	1
movements	1
of	1
the	1
talking	1
hand,	1
and	1
read	1
clearly	1
the	1
message--	1
"I	1
will	1
only	1
talk	1
like	1
this.	1
We	1
must	1
get	1
used	1
to	1
it."	1
He	1
rapped	1
out	1
the	1
answer	1
with	1
the	1
impatience	1
of	1
relief--	1
"All	1
right.	1
Let's	1
get	1
out	1
to	1
breakfast."	1
They	1
took	1
their	1
hats	1
and	1
sticks	1
in	1
silence;	1
but	1
as	1
Syme	1
took	1
his	1
sword-stick,	1
he	1
held	1
it	1
hard.	1
They	1
paused	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
only	1
to	1
stuff	1
down	1
coffee	1
and	1
coarse	1
thick	1
sandwiches	1
at	1
a	1
coffee	1
stall,	1
and	1
then	1
made	1
their	1
way	1
across	1
the	1
river,	1
which	1
under	1
the	1
grey	1
and	1
growing	1
light	1
looked	1
as	1
desolate	1
as	1
Acheron.	1
They	1
reached	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
huge	1
block	1
of	1
buildings	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
seen	1
from	1
across	1
the	1
river,	1
and	1
began	1
in	1
silence	1
to	1
mount	1
the	1
naked	1
and	1
numberless	1
stone	1
steps,	1
only	1
pausing	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
to	1
make	1
short	1
remarks	1
on	1
the	1
rail	1
of	1
the	1
banisters.	1
At	1
about	1
every	1
other	1
flight	1
they	1
passed	1
a	1
window;	1
each	1
window	1
showed	1
them	1
a	1
pale	1
and	1
tragic	1
dawn	1
lifting	1
itself	1
laboriously	1
over	1
London.	1
From	1
each	1
the	1
innumerable	1
roofs	1
of	1
slate	1
looked	1
like	1
the	1
leaden	1
surges	1
of	1
a	1
grey,	1
troubled	1
sea	1
after	1
rain.	1
Syme	1
was	1
increasingly	1
conscious	1
that	1
his	1
new	1
adventure	1
had	1
somehow	1
a	1
quality	1
of	1
cold	1
sanity	1
worse	1
than	1
the	1
wild	1
adventures	1
of	1
the	1
past.	1
Last	1
night,	1
for	1
instance,	1
the	1
tall	1
tenements	1
had	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
like	1
a	1
tower	1
in	1
a	1
dream.	1
As	1
he	1
now	1
went	1
up	1
the	1
weary	1
and	1
perpetual	1
steps,	1
he	1
was	1
daunted	1
and	1
bewildered	1
by	1
their	1
almost	1
infinite	1
series.	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
hot	1
horror	1
of	1
a	1
dream	1
or	1
of	1
anything	1
that	1
might	1
be	1
exaggeration	1
or	1
delusion.	1
Their	1
infinity	1
was	1
more	1
like	1
the	1
empty	1
infinity	1
of	1
arithmetic,	1
something	1
unthinkable,	1
yet	1
necessary	1
to	1
thought.	1
Or	1
it	1
was	1
like	1
the	1
stunning	1
statements	1
of	1
astronomy	1
about	1
the	1
distance	1
of	1
the	1
fixed	1
stars.	1
He	1
was	1
ascending	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
reason,	1
a	1
thing	1
more	1
hideous	1
than	1
unreason	1
itself.	1
By	1
the	1
time	1
they	1
reached	1
Dr.	1
Bull's	1
landing,	1
a	1
last	1
window	1
showed	1
them	1
a	1
harsh,	1
white	1
dawn	1
edged	1
with	1
banks	1
of	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
coarse	1
red,	1
more	1
like	1
red	1
clay	1
than	1
red	1
cloud.	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
entered	1
Dr.	1
Bull's	1
bare	1
garret	1
it	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
light.	1
Syme	1
had	1
been	1
haunted	1
by	1
a	1
half	1
historic	1
memory	1
in	1
connection	1
with	1
these	1
empty	1
rooms	1
and	1
that	1
austere	1
daybreak.	1
The	1
moment	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
garret	1
and	1
Dr.	1
Bull	1
sitting	1
writing	1
at	1
a	1
table,	1
he	1
remembered	1
what	1
the	1
memory	1
was--the	1
French	1
Revolution.	1
There	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
black	1
outline	1
of	1
a	1
guillotine	1
against	1
that	1
heavy	1
red	1
and	1
white	1
of	1
the	1
morning.	1
Dr.	1
Bull	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
white	1
shirt	1
and	1
black	1
breeches	1
only;	1
his	1
cropped,	1
dark	1
head	1
might	1
well	1
have	1
just	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
its	1
wig;	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
Marat	1
or	1
a	1
more	1
slipshod	1
Robespierre.	1
Yet	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
seen	1
properly,	1
the	1
French	1
fancy	1
fell	1
away.	1
The	1
Jacobins	1
were	1
idealists;	1
there	1
was	1
about	1
this	1
man	1
a	1
murderous	1
materialism.	1
His	1
Dosition	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
somewhat	1
new	1
appearance.	1
The	1
strong,	1
white	1
light	1
of	1
morning	1
coming	1
from	1
one	1
side	1
creating	1
sharp	1
shadows,	1
made	1
him	1
seem	1
both	1
more	1
pale	1
and	1
more	1
angular	1
than	1
he	1
had	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
breakfast	1
on	1
the	1
balcony.	1
Thus	1
the	1
two	1
black	1
glasses	1
that	1
encased	1
his	1
eyes	1
might	1
really	1
have	1
been	1
black	1
cavities	1
in	1
his	1
skull,	1
making	1
him	1
look	1
like	1
a	1
death's-head.	1
And,	1
indeed,	1
if	1
ever	1
Death	1
himself	1
sat	1
writing	1
at	1
a	1
wooden	1
table,	1
it	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
he.	1
He	1
looked	1
up	1
and	1
smiled	1
brightly	1
enough	1
as	1
the	1
men	1
came	1
in,	1
and	1
rose	1
with	1
the	1
resilient	1
rapidity	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
Professor	1
had	1
spoken.	1
He	1
set	1
chairs	1
for	1
both	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
going	1
to	1
a	1
peg	1
behind	1
the	1
door,	1
proceeded	1
to	1
put	1
on	1
a	1
coat	1
and	1
waistcoat	1
of	1
rough,	1
dark	1
tweed;	1
he	1
buttoned	1
it	1
up	1
neatly,	1
and	1
came	1
back	1
to	1
sit	1
down	1
at	1
his	1
table.	1
The	1
quiet	1
good	1
humour	1
of	1
his	1
manner	1
left	1
his	1
two	1
opponents	1
helpless.	1
It	1
was	1
with	1
some	1
momentary	1
difficulty	1
that	1
the	1
Professor	1
broke	1
silence	1
and	1
began,	1
"I'm	1
sorry	1
to	1
disturb	1
you	1
so	1
early,	1
comrade,"	1
said	1
he,	1
with	1
a	1
careful	1
resumption	1
of	1
the	1
slow	1
de	1
Worms	1
manner.	1
"You	1
have	1
no	1
doubt	1
made	1
all	1
the	1
arrangements	1
for	1
the	1
Paris	1
affair?"	1
Then	1
he	1
added	1
with	1
infinite	1
slowness,	1
"We	1
have	1
information	1
which	1
renders	1
intolerable	1
anything	1
in	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
a	1
moment's	1
delay."	1
Dr.	1
Bull	1
smiled	1
again,	1
but	1
continued	1
to	1
gaze	1
on	1
them	1
without	1
speaking.	1
The	1
Professor	1
resumed,	1
a	1
pause	1
before	1
each	1
weary	1
word--	1
"Please	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
me	1
excessively	1
abrupt;	1
but	1
I	1
advise	1
you	1
to	1
alter	1
those	1
plans,	1
or	1
if	1
it	1
is	1
too	1
late	1
for	1
that,	1
to	1
follow	1
your	1
agent	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
support	1
you	1
can	1
get	1
for	1
him.	1
Comrade	1
Syme	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
an	1
experience	1
which	1
it	1
would	1
take	1
more	1
time	1
to	1
recount	1
than	1
we	1
can	1
afford,	1
if	1
we	1
are	1
to	1
act	1
on	1
it.	1
I	1
will,	1
however,	1
relate	1
the	1
occurrence	1
in	1
detail,	1
even	1
at	1
the	1
risk	1
of	1
losing	1
time,	1
if	1
you	1
really	1
feel	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
essential	1
to	1
the	1
understanding	1
of	1
the	1
problem	1
we	1
have	1
to	1
discuss."	1
He	1
was	1
spinning	1
out	1
his	1
sentences,	1
making	1
them	1
intolerably	1
long	1
and	1
lingering,	1
in	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
maddening	1
the	1
practical	1
little	1
Doctor	1
into	1
an	1
explosion	1
of	1
impatience	1
which	1
might	1
show	1
his	1
hand.	1
But	1
the	1
little	1
Doctor	1
continued	1
only	1
to	1
stare	1
and	1
smile,	1
and	1
the	1
monologue	1
was	1
uphill	1
work.	1
Syme	1
began	1
to	1
feel	1
a	1
new	1
sickness	1
and	1
despair.	1
The	1
Doctor's	1
smile	1
and	1
silence	1
were	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
like	1
the	1
cataleptic	1
stare	1
and	1
horrible	1
silence	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
confronted	1
in	1
the	1
Professor	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
before.	1
About	1
the	1
Professor's	1
makeup	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
antics	1
there	1
was	1
always	1
something	1
merely	1
grotesque,	1
like	1
a	1
gollywog.	1
Syme	1
remembered	1
those	1
wild	1
woes	1
of	1
yesterday	1
as	1
one	1
remembers	1
being	1
afraid	1
of	1
Bogy	1
in	1
childhood.	1
But	1
here	1
was	1
daylight;	1
here	1
was	1
a	1
healthy,	1
square-shouldered	1
man	1
in	1
tweeds,	1
not	1
odd	1
save	1
for	1
the	1
accident	1
of	1
his	1
ugly	1
spectacles,	1
not	1
glaring	1
or	1
grinning	1
at	1
all,	1
but	1
smiling	1
steadily	1
and	1
not	1
saying	1
a	1
word.	1
The	1
whole	1
had	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
unbearable	1
reality.	1
Under	1
the	1
increasing	1
sunlight	1
the	1
colours	1
of	1
the	1
Doctor's	1
complexion,	1
the	1
pattern	1
of	1
his	1
tweeds,	1
grew	1
and	1
expanded	1
outrageously,	1
as	1
such	1
things	1
grow	1
too	1
important	1
in	1
a	1
realistic	1
novel.	1
But	1
his	1
smile	1
was	1
quite	1
slight,	1
the	1
pose	1
of	1
his	1
head	1
polite;	1
the	1
only	1
uncanny	1
thing	1
was	1
his	1
silence.	1
"As	1
I	1
say,"	1
resumed	1
the	1
Professor,	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
toiling	1
through	1
heavy	1
sand,	1
"the	1
incident	1
that	1
has	1
occurred	1
to	1
us	1
and	1
has	1
led	1
us	1
to	1
ask	1
for	1
information	1
about	1
the	1
Marquis,	1
is	1
one	1
which	1
you	1
may	1
think	1
it	1
better	1
to	1
have	1
narrated;	1
but	1
as	1
it	1
came	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
Comrade	1
Syme	1
rather	1
than	1
me--"	1
His	1
words	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
dragging	1
out	1
like	1
words	1
in	1
an	1
anthem;	1
but	1
Syme,	1
who	1
was	1
watching,	1
saw	1
his	1
long	1
fingers	1
rattle	1
quickly	1
on	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
crazy	1
table.	1
He	1
read	1
the	1
message,	1
"You	1
must	1
go	1
on.	1
This	1
devil	1
has	1
sucked	1
me	1
dry!"	1
Syme	1
plunged	1
into	1
the	1
breach	1
with	1
that	1
bravado	1
of	1
improvisation	1
which	1
always	1
came	1
to	1
him	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
alarmed.	1
"Yes,	1
the	1
thing	1
really	1
happened	1
to	1
me,"	1
he	1
said	1
hastily.	1
"I	1
had	1
the	1
good	1
fortune	1
to	1
fall	1
into	1
conversation	1
with	1
a	1
detective	1
who	1
took	1
me,	1
thanks	1
to	1
my	1
hat,	1
for	1
a	1
respectable	1
person.	1
Wishing	1
to	1
clinch	1
my	1
reputation	1
for	1
respectability,	1
I	1
took	1
him	1
and	1
made	1
him	1
very	1
drunk	1
at	1
the	1
Savoy.	1
Under	1
this	1
influence	1
he	1
became	1
friendly,	1
and	1
told	1
me	1
in	1
so	1
many	1
words	1
that	1
within	1
a	1
day	1
or	1
two	1
they	1
hope	1
to	1
arrest	1
the	1
Marquis	1
in	1
France.	1
So	1
unless	1
you	1
or	1
I	1
can	1
get	1
on	1
his	1
track--"	1
The	1
Doctor	1
was	1
still	1
smiling	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
friendly	1
way,	1
and	1
his	1
protected	1
eyes	1
were	1
still	1
impenetrable.	1
The	1
Professor	1
signalled	1
to	1
Syme	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
resume	1
his	1
explanation,	1
and	1
he	1
began	1
again	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
elaborate	1
calm.	1
"Syme	1
immediately	1
brought	1
this	1
information	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
we	1
came	1
here	1
together	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
use	1
you	1
would	1
be	1
inclined	1
to	1
make	1
of	1
it.	1
It	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
unquestionably	1
urgent	1
that--"	1
All	1
this	1
time	1
Syme	1
had	1
been	1
staring	1
at	1
the	1
Doctor	1
almost	1
as	1
steadily	1
as	1
the	1
Doctor	1
stared	1
at	1
the	1
Professor,	1
but	1
quite	1
without	1
the	1
smile.	1
The	1
nerves	1
of	1
both	1
comrades-in-arms	1
were	1
near	1
snapping	1
under	1
that	1
strain	1
of	1
motionless	1
amiability,	1
when	1
Syme	1
suddenly	1
leant	1
forward	1
and	1
idly	1
tapped	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
table.	1
His	1
message	1
to	1
his	1
ally	1
ran,	1
"I	1
have	1
an	1
intuition."	1
The	1
Professor,	1
with	1
scarcely	1
a	1
pause	1
in	1
his	1
monologue,	1
signalled	1
back,	1
"Then	1
sit	1
on	1
it."	1
Syme	1
telegraphed,	1
"It	1
is	1
quite	1
extraordinary."	1
The	1
other	1
answered,	1
"Extraordinary	1
rot!"	1
Syme	1
said,	1
"I	1
am	1
a	1
poet."	1
The	1
other	1
retorted,	1
"You	1
are	1
a	1
dead	1
man."	1
Syme	1
had	1
gone	1
quite	1
red	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
yellow	1
hair,	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
were	1
burning	1
feverishly.	1
As	1
he	1
said	1
he	1
had	1
an	1
intuition,	1
and	1
it	1
had	1
risen	1
to	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
lightheaded	1
certainty.	1
Resuming	1
his	1
symbolic	1
taps,	1
he	1
signalled	1
to	1
his	1
friend,	1
"You	1
scarcely	1
realise	1
how	1
poetic	1
my	1
intuition	1
is.	1
It	1
has	1
that	1
sudden	1
quality	1
we	1
sometimes	1
feel	1
in	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
spring."	1
He	1
then	1
studied	1
the	1
answer	1
on	1
his	1
friend's	1
fingers.	1
The	1
answer	1
was,	1
"Go	1
to	1
hell!	1
"	1
The	1
Professor	1
then	1
resumed	1
his	1
merely	1
verbal	1
monologue	1
addressed	1
to	1
the	1
Doctor.	1
"Perhaps	1
I	1
should	1
rather	1
say,"	1
said	1
Syme	1
on	1
his	1
fingers,	1
"that	1
it	1
resembles	1
that	1
sudden	1
smell	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
which	1
may	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
lush	1
woods."	1
His	1
companion	1
disdained	1
to	1
reply.	1
"Or	1
yet	1
again,"	1
tapped	1
Syme,	1
"it	1
is	1
positive,	1
as	1
is	1
the	1
passionate	1
red	1
hair	1
of	1
a	1
beautiful	1
woman."	1
The	1
Professor	1
was	1
continuing	1
his	1
speech,	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
it	1
Syme	1
decided	1
to	1
act.	1
He	1
leant	1
across	1
the	1
table,	1
and	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
that	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
neglected--	1
"Dr.	1
Bull!"	1
The	1
Doctor's	1
sleek	1
and	1
smiling	1
head	1
did	1
not	1
move,	1
but	1
they	1
could	1
have	1
sworn	1
that	1
under	1
his	1
dark	1
glasses	1
his	1
eyes	1
darted	1
towards	1
Syme.	1
"Dr.	1
Bull,"	1
said	1
Syme,	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
peculiarly	1
precise	1
and	1
courteous,	1
"would	1
you	1
do	1
me	1
a	1
small	1
favour?	1
Would	1
you	1
be	1
so	1
kind	1
as	1
to	1
take	1
off	1
your	1
spectacles?"	1
The	1
Professor	1
swung	1
round	1
on	1
his	1
seat,	1
and	1
stared	1
at	1
Syme	1
with	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
frozen	1
fury	1
of	1
astonishment.	1
Syme,	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
has	1
thrown	1
his	1
life	1
and	1
fortune	1
on	1
the	1
table,	1
leaned	1
forward	1
with	1
a	1
fiery	1
face.	1
The	1
Doctor	1
did	1
not	1
move.	1
For	1
a	1
few	1
seconds	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
silence	1
in	1
which	1
one	1
could	1
hear	1
a	1
pin	1
drop,	1
split	1
once	1
by	1
the	1
single	1
hoot	1
of	1
a	1
distant	1
steamer	1
on	1
the	1
Thames.	1
Then	1
Dr.	1
Bull	1
rose	1
slowly,	1
still	1
smiling,	1
and	1
took	1
off	1
his	1
spectacles.	1
Syme	1
sprang	1
to	1
his	1
feet,	1
stepping	1
backwards	1
a	1
little,	1
like	1
a	1
chemical	1
lecturer	1
from	1
a	1
successful	1
explosion.	1
His	1
eyes	1
were	1
like	1
stars,	1
and	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
he	1
could	1
only	1
point	1
without	1
speaking.	1
The	1
Professor	1
had	1
also	1
started	1
to	1
his	1
feet,	1
forgetful	1
of	1
his	1
supposed	1
paralysis.	1
He	1
leant	1
on	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
the	1
chair	1
and	1
stared	1
doubtfully	1
at	1
Dr.	1
Bull,	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
Doctor	1
had	1
been	1
turned	1
into	1
a	1
toad	1
before	1
his	1
eyes.	1
And	1
indeed	1
it	1
was	1
almost	1
as	1
great	1
a	1
transformation	1
scene.	1
The	1
two	1
detectives	1
saw	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
chair	1
before	1
them	1
a	1
very	1
boyish-looking	1
young	1
man,	1
with	1
very	1
frank	1
and	1
happy	1
hazel	1
eyes,	1
an	1
open	1
expression,	1
cockney	1
clothes	1
like	1
those	1
of	1
a	1
city	1
clerk,	1
and	1
an	1
unquestionable	1
breath	1
about	1
him	1
of	1
being	1
very	1
good	1
and	1
rather	1
commonplace.	1
The	1
smile	1
was	1
still	1
there,	1
but	1
it	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
first	1
smile	1
of	1
a	1
baby.	1
"I	1
knew	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
poet,"	1
cried	1
Syme	1
in	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
ecstasy.	1
"I	1
knew	1
my	1
intuition	1
was	1
as	1
infallible	1
as	1
the	1
Pope.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
spectacles	1
that	1
did	1
it!	1
It	1
was	1
all	1
the	1
spectacles.	1
Given	1
those	1
beastly	1
black	1
eyes,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
him	1
his	1
health	1
and	1
his	1
jolly	1
looks,	1
made	1
him	1
a	1
live	1
devil	1
among	1
dead	1
ones."	1
"It	1
certainly	1
does	1
make	1
a	1
queer	1
difference,"	1
said	1
the	1
Professor	1
shakily.	1
"But	1
as	1
regards	1
the	1
project	1
of	1
Dr.	1
Bull--"	1
"Project	1
be	1
damned!"	1
roared	1
Syme,	1
beside	1
himself.	1
"Look	1
at	1
him!	1
Look	1
at	1
his	1
face,	1
look	1
at	1
his	1
collar,	1
look	1
at	1
his	1
blessed	1
boots!	1
You	1
don't	1
suppose,	1
do	1
you,	1
that	1
that	1
thing's	1
an	1
anarchist?"	1
"Syme!"	1
cried	1
the	1
other	1
in	1
an	1
apprehensive	1
agony.	1
"Why,	1
by	1
God,"	1
said	1
Syme,	1
"I'll	1
take	1
the	1
risk	1
of	1
that	1
myself!	1
Dr.	1
Bull,	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
police	1
officer.	1
There's	1
my	1
card,"	1
and	1
he	1
flung	1
down	1
the	1
blue	1
card	1
upon	1
the	1
table.	1
The	1
Professor	1
still	1
feared	1
that	1
all	1
was	1
lost;	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
loyal.	1
He	1
pulled	1
out	1
his	1
own	1
official	1
card	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
beside	1
his	1
friend's.	1
Then	1
the	1
third	1
man	1
burst	1
out	1
laughing,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
that	1
morning	1
they	1
heard	1
his	1
voice.	1
"I'm	1
awfully	1
glad	1
you	1
chaps	1
have	1
come	1
so	1
early,"	1
he	1
said,	1
with	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
schoolboy	1
flippancy,	1
"for	1
we	1
can	1
all	1
start	1
for	1
France	1
together.	1
Yes,	1
I'm	1
in	1
the	1
force	1
right	1
enough,"	1
and	1
he	1
flicked	1
a	1
blue	1
card	1
towards	1
them	1
lightly	1
as	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
form.	1
Clapping	1
a	1
brisk	1
bowler	1
on	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
resuming	1
his	1
goblin	1
glasses,	1
the	1
Doctor	1
moved	1
so	1
quickly	1
towards	1
the	1
door,	1
that	1
the	1
others	1
instinctively	1
followed	1
him.	1
Syme	1
seemed	1
a	1
little	1
distrait,	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
passed	1
under	1
the	1
doorway	1
he	1
suddenly	1
struck	1
his	1
stick	1
on	1
the	1
stone	1
passage	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
rang.	1
"But	1
Lord	1
God	1
Almighty,"	1
he	1
cried	1
out,	1
"if	1
this	1
is	1
all	1
right,	1
there	1
were	1
more	1
damned	1
detectives	1
than	1
there	1
were	1
damned	1
dynamiters	1
at	1
the	1
damned	1
Council!"	1
"We	1
might	1
have	1
fought	1
easily,"	1
said	1
Bull;	1
"we	1
were	1
four	1
against	1
three."	1
The	1
Professor	1
was	1
descending	1
the	1
stairs,	1
but	1
his	1
voice	1
came	1
up	1
from	1
below.	1
"No,"	1
said	1
the	1
voice,	1
"we	1
were	1
not	1
four	1
against	1
three--we	1
were	1
not	1
so	1
lucky.	1
We	1
were	1
four	1
against	1
One."	1
The	1
others	1
went	1
down	1
the	1
stairs	1
in	1
silence.	1
The	1
young	1
man	1
called	1
Bull,	1
with	1
an	1
innocent	1
courtesy	1
characteristic	1
of	1
him,	1
insisted	1
on	1
going	1
last	1
until	1
they	1
reached	1
the	1
street;	1
but	1
there	1
his	1
own	1
robust	1
rapidity	1
asserted	1
itself	1
unconsciously,	1
and	1
he	1
walked	1
quickly	1
on	1
ahead	1
towards	1
a	1
railway	1
inquiry	1
office,	1
talking	1
to	1
the	1
others	1
over	1
his	1
shoulder.	1
"It	1
is	1
jolly	1
to	1
get	1
some	1
pals,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"I've	1
been	1
half	1
dead	1
with	1
the	1
jumps,	1
being	1
quite	1
alone.	1
I	1
nearly	1
flung	1
my	1
arms	1
round	1
Gogol	1
and	1
embraced	1
him,	1
which	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
imprudent.	1
I	1
hope	1
you	1
won't	1
despise	1
me	1
for	1
having	1
been	1
in	1
a	1
blue	1
funk."	1
"All	1
the	1
blue	1
devils	1
in	1
blue	1
hell,"	1
said	1
Syme,	1
"contributed	1
to	1
my	1
blue	1
funk!	1
But	1
the	1
worst	1
devil	1
was	1
you	1
and	1
your	1
infernal	1
goggles."	1
The	1
young	1
man	1
laughed	1
delightedly.	1
"Wasn't	1
it	1
a	1
rag?"	1
he	1
said.	1
"Such	1
a	1
simple	1
idea--not	1
my	1
own.	1
I	1
haven't	1
got	1
the	1
brains.	1
You	1
see,	1
I	1
wanted	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
detective	1
service,	1
especially	1
the	1
anti-dynamite	1
business.	1
But	1
for	1
that	1
purpose	1
they	1
wanted	1
someone	1
to	1
dress	1
up	1
as	1
a	1
dynamiter;	1
and	1
they	1
all	1
swore	1
by	1
blazes	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
never	1
look	1
like	1
a	1
dynamiter.	1
They	1
said	1
my	1
very	1
walk	1
was	1
respectable,	1
and	1
that	1
seen	1
from	1
behind	1
I	1
looked	1
like	1
the	1
British	1
Constitution.	1
They	1
said	1
I	1
looked	1
too	1
healthy	1
and	1
too	1
optimistic,	1
and	1
too	1
reliable	1
and	1
benevolent;	1
they	1
called	1
me	1
all	1
sorts	1
of	1
names	1
at	1
Scotland	1
Yard.	1
They	1
said	1
that	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
criminal,	1
I	1
might	1
have	1
made	1
my	1
fortune	1
by	1
looking	1
so	1
like	1
an	1
honest	1
man;	1
but	1
as	1
I	1
had	1
the	1
misfortune	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
honest	1
man,	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
even	1
the	1
remotest	1
chance	1
of	1
my	1
assisting	1
them	1
by	1
ever	1
looking	1
like	1
a	1
criminal.	1
But	1
as	1
last	1
I	1
was	1
brought	1
before	1
some	1
old	1
josser	1
who	1
was	1
high	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
force,	1
and	1
who	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
no	1
end	1
of	1
a	1
head	1
on	1
his	1
shoulders.	1
And	1
there	1
the	1
others	1
all	1
talked	1
hopelessly.	1
One	1
asked	1
whether	1
a	1
bushy	1
beard	1
would	1
hide	1
my	1
nice	1
smile;	1
another	1
said	1
that	1
if	1
they	1
blacked	1
my	1
face	1
I	1
might	1
look	1
like	1
a	1
negro	1
anarchist;	1
but	1
this	1
old	1
chap	1
chipped	1
in	1
with	1
a	1
most	1
extraordinary	1
remark.	1
'A	1
pair	1
of	1
smoked	1
spectacles	1
will	1
do	1
it,'	1
he	1
said	1
positively.	1
'Look	1
at	1
him	1
now;	1
he	1
looks	1
like	1
an	1
angelic	1
office	1
boy.	1
Put	1
him	1
on	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
smoked	1
spectacles,	1
and	1
children	1
will	1
scream	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
him.'	1
And	1
so	1
it	1
was,	1
by	1
George!	1
When	1
once	1
my	1
eyes	1
were	1
covered,	1
all	1
the	1
rest,	1
smile	1
and	1
big	1
shoulders	1
and	1
short	1
hair,	1
made	1
me	1
look	1
a	1
perfect	1
little	1
devil.	1
As	1
I	1
say,	1
it	1
was	1
simple	1
enough	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
done,	1
like	1
miracles;	1
but	1
that	1
wasn't	1
the	1
really	1
miraculous	1
part	1
of	1
it.	1
There	1
was	1
one	1
really	1
staggering	1
thing	1
about	1
the	1
business,	1
and	1
my	1
head	1
still	1
turns	1
at	1
it."	1
"What	1
was	1
that?"	1
asked	1
Syme.	1
"I'll	1
tell	1
you,"	1
answered	1
the	1
man	1
in	1
spectacles.	1
"This	1
big	1
pot	1
in	1
the	1
police	1
who	1
sized	1
me	1
up	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
knew	1
how	1
the	1
goggles	1
would	1
go	1
with	1
my	1
hair	1
and	1
socks--by	1
God,	1
he	1
never	1
saw	1
me	1
at	1
all!"	1
Syme's	1
eyes	1
suddenly	1
flashed	1
on	1
him.	1
"How	1
was	1
that?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
"I	1
thought	1
you	1
talked	1
to	1
him."	1
"So	1
I	1
did,"	1
said	1
Bull	1
brightly;	1
"but	1
we	1
talked	1
in	1
a	1
pitch-dark	1
room	1
like	1
a	1
coalcellar.	1
There,	1
you	1
would	1
never	1
have	1
guessed	1
that."	1
"I	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
conceived	1
it,"	1
said	1
Syme	1
gravely.	1
"It	1
is	1
indeed	1
a	1
new	1
idea,"	1
said	1
the	1
Professor.	1
Their	1
new	1
ally	1
was	1
in	1
practical	1
matters	1
a	1
whirlwind.	1
At	1
the	1
inquiry	1
office	1
he	1
asked	1
with	1
businesslike	1
brevity	1
about	1
the	1
trains	1
for	1
Dover.	1
Having	1
got	1
his	1
information,	1
he	1
bundled	1
the	1
company	1
into	1
a	1
cab,	1
and	1
put	1
them	1
and	1
himself	1
inside	1
a	1
railway	1
carriage	1
before	1
they	1
had	1
properly	1
realised	1
the	1
breathless	1
process.	1
They	1
were	1
already	1
on	1
the	1
Calais	1
boat	1
before	1
conversation	1
flowed	1
freely.	1
"I	1
had	1
already	1
arranged,"	1
he	1
explained,	1
"to	1
go	1
to	1
France	1
for	1
my	1
lunch;	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
delighted	1
to	1
have	1
someone	1
to	1
lunch	1
with	1
me.	1
You	1
see,	1
I	1
had	1
to	1
send	1
that	1
beast,	1
the	1
Marquis,	1
over	1
with	1
his	1
bomb,	1
because	1
the	1
President	1
had	1
his	1
eye	1
on	1
me,	1
though	1
God	1
knows	1
how.	1
I'll	1
tell	1
you	1
the	1
story	1
some	1
day.	1
It	1
was	1
perfectly	1
choking.	1
Whenever	1
I	1
tried	1
to	1
slip	1
out	1
of	1
it	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
President	1
somewhere,	1
smiling	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
bow-window	1
of	1
a	1
club,	1
or	1
taking	1
off	1
his	1
hat	1
to	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
an	1
omnibus.	1
I	1
tell	1
you,	1
you	1
can	1
say	1
what	1
you	1
like,	1
that	1
fellow	1
sold	1
himself	1
to	1
the	1
devil;	1
he	1
can	1
be	1
in	1
six	1
places	1
at	1
once."	1
"So	1
you	1
sent	1
the	1
Marquis	1
off,	1
I	1
understand,"	1
asked	1
the	1
Professor.	1
"Was	1
it	1
long	1
ago?	1
Shall	1
we	1
be	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
catch	1
him?"	1
"Yes,"	1
answered	1
the	1
new	1
guide,	1
"I've	1
timed	1
it	1
all.	1
He'll	1
still	1
be	1
at	1
Calais	1
when	1
we	1
arrive."	1
"But	1
when	1
we	1
do	1
catch	1
him	1
at	1
Calais,"	1
said	1
the	1
Professor,	1
"what	1
are	1
we	1
going	1
to	1
do?"	1
At	1
this	1
question	1
the	1
countenance	1
of	1
Dr.	1
Bull	1
fell	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time.	1
He	1
reflected	1
a	1
little,	1
and	1
then	1
said--	1
"Theoretically,	1
I	1
suppose,	1
we	1
ought	1
to	1
call	1
the	1
police."	1
"Not	1
I,"	1
said	1
Syme.	1
"Theoretically	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
drown	1
myself	1
first.	1
I	1
promised	1
a	1
poor	1
fellow,	1
who	1
was	1
a	1
real	1
modern	1
pessimist,	1
on	1
my	1
word	1
of	1
honour	1
not	1
to	1
tell	1
the	1
police.	1
I'm	1
no	1
hand	1
at	1
casuistry,	1
but	1
I	1
can't	1
break	1
my	1
word	1
to	1
a	1
modern	1
pessimist.	1
It's	1
like	1
breaking	1
one's	1
word	1
to	1
a	1
child."	1
"I'm	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
boat,"	1
said	1
the	1
Professor.	1
"I	1
tried	1
to	1
tell	1
the	1
police	1
and	1
I	1
couldn't,	1
because	1
of	1
some	1
silly	1
oath	1
I	1
took.	1
You	1
see,	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
an	1
actor	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
all-round	1
beast.	1
Perjury	1
or	1
treason	1
is	1
the	1
only	1
crime	1
I	1
haven't	1
committed.	1
If	1
I	1
did	1
that	1
I	1
shouldn't	1
know	1
the	1
difference	1
between	1
right	1
and	1
wrong."	1
"I've	1
been	1
through	1
all	1
that,"	1
said	1
Dr.	1
Bull,	1
"and	1
I've	1
made	1
up	1
my	1
mind.	1
I	1
gave	1
my	1
promise	1
to	1
the	1
Secretary--you	1
know	1
him,	1
man	1
who	1
smiles	1
upside	1
down.	1
My	1
friends,	1
that	1
man	1
is	1
the	1
most	1
utterly	1
unhappy	1
man	1
that	1
was	1
ever	1
human.	1
It	1
may	1
be	1
his	1
digestion,	1
or	1
his	1
conscience,	1
or	1
his	1
nerves,	1
or	1
his	1
philosophy	1
of	1
the	1
universe,	1
but	1
he's	1
damned,	1
he's	1
in	1
hell!	1
Well,	1
I	1
can't	1
turn	1
on	1
a	1
man	1
like	1
that,	1
and	1
hunt	1
him	1
down.	1
It's	1
like	1
whipping	1
a	1
leper.	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
mad,	1
but	1
that's	1
how	1
I	1
feel;	1
and	1
there's	1
jolly	1
well	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
it."	1
"I	1
don't	1
think	1
you're	1
mad,"	1
said	1
Syme.	1
"I	1
knew	1
you	1
would	1
decide	1
like	1
that	1
when	1
first	1
you--"	1
"Eh?"	1
said	1
Dr.	1
Bull.	1
"When	1
first	1
you	1
took	1
off	1
your	1
spectacles."	1
Dr.	1
Bull	1
smiled	1
a	1
little,	1
and	1
strolled	1
across	1
the	1
deck	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
sunlit	1
sea.	1
Then	1
he	1
strolled	1
back	1
again,	1
kicking	1
his	1
heels	1
carelessly,	1
and	1
a	1
companionable	1
silence	1
fell	1
between	1
the	1
three	1
men.	1
"Well,"	1
said	1
Syme,	1
"it	1
seems	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
kind	1
of	1
morality	1
or	1
immorality,	1
so	1
we	1
had	1
better	1
face	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
comes	1
of	1
it."	1
"Yes,"	1
assented	1
the	1
Professor,	1
"you're	1
quite	1
right;	1
and	1
we	1
must	1
hurry	1
up,	1
for	1
I	1
can	1
see	1
the	1
Grey	1
Nose	1
standing	1
out	1
from	1
France."	1
"The	1
fact	1
that	1
comes	1
of	1
it,"	1
said	1
Syme	1
seriously,	1
"is	1
this,	1
that	1
we	1
three	1
are	1
alone	1
on	1
this	1
planet.	1
Gogol	1
has	1
gone,	1
God	1
knows	1
where;	1
perhaps	1
the	1
President	1
has	1
smashed	1
him	1
like	1
a	1
fly.	1
On	1
the	1
Council	1
we	1
are	1
three	1
men	1
against	1
three,	1
like	1
the	1
Romans	1
who	1
held	1
the	1
bridge.	1
But	1
we	1
are	1
worse	1
off	1
than	1
that,	1
first	1
because	1
they	1
can	1
appeal	1
to	1
their	1
organization	1
and	1
we	1
cannot	1
appeal	1
to	1
ours,	1
and	1
second	1
because--"	1
"Because	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
other	1
three	1
men,"	1
said	1
the	1
Professor,	1
"is	1
not	1
a	1
man."	1
Syme	1
nodded	1
and	1
was	1
silent	1
for	1
a	1
second	1
or	1
two,	1
then	1
he	1
said--	1
"My	1
idea	1
is	1
this.	1
We	1
must	1
do	1
something	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
Marquis	1
in	1
Calais	1
till	1
tomorrow	1
midday.	1
I	1
have	1
turned	1
over	1
twenty	1
schemes	1
in	1
my	1
head.	1
We	1
cannot	1
denounce	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
dynamiter;	1
that	1
is	1
agreed.	1
We	1
cannot	1
get	1
him	1
detained	1
on	1
some	1
trivial	1
charge,	1
for	1
we	1
should	1
have	1
to	1
appear;	1
he	1
knows	1
us,	1
and	1
he	1
would	1
smell	1
a	1
rat.	1
We	1
cannot	1
pretend	1
to	1
keep	1
him	1
on	1
anarchist	1
business;	1
he	1
might	1
swallow	1
much	1
in	1
that	1
way,	1
but	1
not	1
the	1
notion	1
of	1
stopping	1
in	1
Calais	1
while	1
the	1
Czar	1
went	1
safely	1
through	1
Paris.	1
We	1
might	1
try	1
to	1
kidnap	1
him,	1
and	1
lock	1
him	1
up	1
ourselves;	1
but	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
well-known	1
man	1
here.	1
He	1
has	1
a	1
whole	1
bodyguard	1
of	1
friends;	1
he	1
is	1
very	1
strong	1
and	1
brave,	1
and	1
the	1
event	1
is	1
doubtful.	1
The	1
only	1
thing	1
I	1
can	1
see	1
to	1
do	1
is	1
actually	1
to	1
take	1
advantage	1
of	1
the	1
very	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
Marquis's	1
favour.	1
I	1
am	1
going	1
to	1
profit	1
by	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
highly	1
respected	1
nobleman.	1
I	1
am	1
going	1
to	1
profit	1
by	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
many	1
friends	1
and	1
moves	1
in	1
the	1
best	1
society."	1
"What	1
the	1
devil	1
are	1
you	1
talking	1
about?"	1
asked	1
the	1
Professor.	1
"The	1
Symes	1
are	1
first	1
mentioned	1
in	1
the	1
fourteenth	1
century,"	1
said	1
Syme;	1
"but	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
tradition	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
rode	1
behind	1
Bruce	1
at	1
Bannockburn.	1
Since	1
1350	1
the	1
tree	1
is	1
quite	1
clear."	1
"He's	1
gone	1
off	1
his	1
head,"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
Doctor,	1
staring.	1
"Our	1
bearings,"	1
continued	1
Syme	1
calmly,	1
"are	1
'argent	1
a	1
chevron	1
gules	1
charged	1
with	1
three	1
cross	1
crosslets	1
of	1
the	1
field.'	1
The	1
motto	1
varies."	1
The	1
Professor	1
seized	1
Syme	1
roughly	1
by	1
the	1
waistcoat.	1
"We	1
are	1
just	1
inshore,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"Are	1
you	1
seasick	1
or	1
joking	1
in	1
the	1
wrong	1
place?"	1
"My	1
remarks	1
are	1
almost	1
painfully	1
practical,"	1
answered	1
Syme,	1
in	1
an	1
unhurried	1
manner.	1
"The	1
house	1
of	1
St.	1
Eustache	1
also	1
is	1
very	1
ancient.	1
The	1
Marquis	1
cannot	1
deny	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
gentleman.	1
He	1
cannot	1
deny	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
gentleman.	1
And	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
put	1
the	1
matter	1
of	1
my	1
social	1
position	1
quite	1
beyond	1
a	1
doubt,	1
I	1
propose	1
at	1
the	1
earliest	1
opportunity	1
to	1
knock	1
his	1
hat	1
off.	1
But	1
here	1
we	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
harbour."	1
They	1
went	1
on	1
shore	1
under	1
the	1
strong	1
sun	1
in	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
daze.	1
Syme,	1
who	1
had	1
now	1
taken	1
the	1
lead	1
as	1
Bull	1
had	1
taken	1
it	1
in	1
London,	1
led	1
them	1
along	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
marine	1
parade	1
until	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
some	1
cafes,	1
embowered	1
in	1
a	1
bulk	1
of	1
greenery	1
and	1
overlooking	1
the	1
sea.	1
As	1
he	1
went	1
before	1
them	1
his	1
step	1
was	1
slightly	1
swaggering,	1
and	1
he	1
swung	1
his	1
stick	1
like	1
a	1
sword.	1
He	1
was	1
making	1
apparently	1
for	1
the	1
extreme	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
line	1
of	1
cafes,	1
but	1
he	1
stopped	1
abruptly.	1
With	1
a	1
sharp	1
gesture	1
he	1
motioned	1
them	1
to	1
silence,	1
but	1
he	1
pointed	1
with	1
one	1
gloved	1
finger	1
to	1
a	1
cafe	1
table	1
under	1
a	1
bank	1
of	1
flowering	1
foliage	1
at	1
which	1
sat	1
the	1
Marquis	1
de	1
St.	1
Eustache,	1
his	1
teeth	1
shining	1
in	1
his	1
thick,	1
black	1
beard,	1
and	1
his	1
bold,	1
brown	1
face	1
shadowed	1
by	1
a	1
light	1
yellow	1
straw	1
hat	1
and	1
outlined	1
against	1
the	1
violet	1
sea.	1
CHAPTER	1
X	1
THE	1
DUEL	1
SYME	1
sat	1
down	1
at	1
a	1
cafe	1
table	1
with	1
his	1
companions,	1
his	1
blue	1
eyes	1
sparkling	1
like	1
the	1
bright	1
sea	1
below,	1
and	1
ordered	1
a	1
bottle	1
of	1
Saumur	1
with	1
a	1
pleased	1
impatience.	1
He	1
was	1
for	1
some	1
reason	1
in	1
a	1
condition	1
of	1
curious	1
hilarity.	1
His	1
spirits	1
were	1
already	1
unnaturally	1
high;	1
they	1
rose	1
as	1
the	1
Saumur	1
sank,	1
and	1
in	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
his	1
talk	1
was	1
a	1
torrent	1
of	1
nonsense.	1
He	1
professed	1
to	1
be	1
making	1
out	1
a	1
plan	1
of	1
the	1
conversation	1
which	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
ensue	1
between	1
himself	1
and	1
the	1
deadly	1
Marquis.	1
He	1
jotted	1
it	1
down	1
wildly	1
with	1
a	1
pencil.	1
It	1
was	1
arranged	1
like	1
a	1
printed	1
catechism,	1
with	1
questions	1
and	1
answers,	1
and	1
was	1
delivered	1
with	1
an	1
extraordinary	1
rapidity	1
of	1
utterance.	1
"I	1
shall	1
approach.	1
Before	1
taking	1
off	1
his	1
hat,	1
I	1
shall	1
take	1
off	1
my	1
own.	1
I	1
shall	1
say,	1
'The	1
Marquis	1
de	1
Saint	1
Eustache,	1
I	1
believe.'	1
He	1
will	1
say,	1
'The	1
celebrated	1
Mr.	1
Syme,	1
I	1
presume.'	1
He	1
will	1
say	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
exquisite	1
French,	1
'How	1
are	1
you?'	1
I	1
shall	1
reply	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
exquisite	1
Cockney,	1
'Oh,	1
just	1
the	1
Syme--'	1
"	1
"Oh,	1
shut	1
it,"	1
said	1
the	1
man	1
in	1
spectacles.	1
"Pull	1
yourself	1
together,	1
and	1
chuck	1
away	1
that	1
bit	1
of	1
paper.	1
What	1
are	1
you	1
really	1
going	1
to	1
do?"	1
"But	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
lovely	1
catechism,"	1
said	1
Syme	1
pathetically.	1
"Do	1
let	1
me	1
read	1
it	1
you.	1
It	1
has	1
only	1
forty-three	1
questions	1
and	1
answers,	1
and	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
Marquis's	1
answers	1
are	1
wonderfully	1
witty.	1
I	1
like	1
to	1
be	1
just	1
to	1
my	1
enemy."	1
"But	1
what's	1
the	1
good	1
of	1
it	1
all?"	1
asked	1
Dr.	1
Bull	1
in	1
exasperation.	1
"It	1
leads	1
up	1
to	1
my	1
challenge,	1
don't	1
you	1
see,"	1
said	1
Syme,	1
beaming.	1
"When	1
the	1
Marquis	1
has	1
given	1
the	1
thirty-ninth	1
reply,	1
which	1
runs--"	1
"Has	1
it	1
by	1
any	1
chance	1
occurred	1
to	1
you,"	1
asked	1
the	1
Professor,	1
with	1
a	1
ponderous	1
simplicity,	1
"that	1
the	1
Marquis	1
may	1
not	1
say	1
all	1
the	1
forty-three	1
things	1
you	1
have	1
put	1
down	1
for	1
him?	1
In	1
that	1
case,	1
I	1
understand,	1
your	1
own	1
epigrams	1
may	1
appear	1
somewhat	1
more	1
forced."	1
Syme	1
struck	1
the	1
table	1
with	1
a	1
radiant	1
face.	1
"Why,	1
how	1
true	1
that	1
is,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"and	1
I	1
never	1
thought	1
of	1
it.	1
Sir,	1
you	1
have	1
an	1
intellect	1
beyond	1
the	1
common.	1
You	1
will	1
make	1
a	1
name."	1
"Oh,	1
you're	1
as	1
drunk	1
as	1
an	1
owl!"	1
said	1
the	1
Doctor.	1
"It	1
only	1
remains,"	1
continued	1
Syme	1
quite	1
unperturbed,	1
"to	1
adopt	1
some	1
other	1
method	1
of	1
breaking	1
the	1
ice	1
(if	1
I	1
may	1
so	1
express	1
it)	1
between	1
myself	1
and	1
the	1
man	1
I	1
wish	1
to	1
kill.	1
And	1
since	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
a	1
dialogue	1
cannot	1
be	1
predicted	1
by	1
one	1
of	1
its	1
parties	1
alone	1
(as	1
you	1
have	1
pointed	1
out	1
with	1
such	1
recondite	1
acumen),	1
the	1
only	1
thing	1
to	1
be	1
done,	1
I	1
suppose,	1
is	1
for	1
the	1
one	1
party,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
possible,	1
to	1
do	1
all	1
the	1
dialogue	1
by	1
himself.	1
And	1
so	1
I	1
will,	1
by	1
George!"	1
And	1
he	1
stood	1
up	1
suddenly,	1
his	1
yellow	1
hair	1
blowing	1
in	1
the	1
slight	1
sea	1
breeze.	1
A	1
band	1
was	1
playing	1
in	1
a	1
cafe	1
chantant	1
hidden	1
somewhere	1
among	1
the	1
trees,	1
and	1
a	1
woman	1
had	1
just	1
stopped	1
singing.	1
On	1
Syme's	1
heated	1
head	1
the	1
bray	1
of	1
the	1
brass	1
band	1
seemed	1
like	1
the	1
jar	1
and	1
jingle	1
of	1
that	1
barrel-organ	1
in	1
Leicester	1
Square,	1
to	1
the	1
tune	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
once	1
stood	1
up	1
to	1
die.	1
He	1
looked	1
across	1
to	1
the	1
little	1
table	1
where	1
the	1
Marquis	1
sat.	1
The	1
man	1
had	1
two	1
companions	1
now,	1
solemn	1
Frenchmen	1
in	1
frock-coats	1
and	1
silk	1
hats,	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
red	1
rosette	1
of	1
the	1
Legion	1
of	1
Honour,	1
evidently	1
people	1
of	1
a	1
solid	1
social	1
position.	1
Besides	1
these	1
black,	1
cylindrical	1
costumes,	1
the	1
Marquis,	1
in	1
his	1
loose	1
straw	1
hat	1
and	1
light	1
spring	1
clothes,	1
looked	1
Bohemian	1
and	1
even	1
barbaric;	1
but	1
he	1
looked	1
the	1
Marquis.	1
Indeed,	1
one	1
might	1
say	1
that	1
he	1
looked	1
the	1
king,	1
with	1
his	1
animal	1
elegance,	1
his	1
scornful	1
eyes,	1
and	1
his	1
proud	1
head	1
lifted	1
against	1
the	1
purple	1
sea.	1
But	1
he	1
was	1
no	1
Christian	1
king,	1
at	1
any	1
rate;	1
he	1
was,	1
rather,	1
some	1
swarthy	1
despot,	1
half	1
Greek,	1
half	1
Asiatic,	1
who	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
when	1
slavery	1
seemed	1
natural	1
looked	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
Mediterranean,	1
on	1
his	1
galley	1
and	1
his	1
groaning	1
slaves.	1
Just	1
so,	1
Syme	1
thought,	1
would	1
the	1
brown-gold	1
face	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
tyrant	1
have	1
shown	1
against	1
the	1
dark	1
green	1
olives	1
and	1
the	1
burning	1
blue.	1
"Are	1
you	1
going	1
to	1
address	1
the	1
meeting?"	1
asked	1
the	1
Professor	1
peevishly,	1
seeing	1
that	1
Syme	1
still	1
stood	1
up	1
without	1
moving.	1
Syme	1
drained	1
his	1
last	1
glass	1
of	1
sparkling	1
wine.	1
"I	1
am,"	1
he	1
said,	1
pointing	1
across	1
to	1
the	1
Marquis	1
and	1
his	1
companions,	1
"that	1
meeting.	1
That	1
meeting	1
displeases	1
me.	1
I	1
am	1
going	1
to	1
pull	1
that	1
meeting's	1
great	1
ugly,	1
mahogany-coloured	1
nose."	1
He	1
stepped	1
across	1
swiftly,	1
if	1
not	1
quite	1
steadily.	1
The	1
Marquis,	1
seeing	1
him,	1
arched	1
his	1
black	1
Assyrian	1
eyebrows	1
in	1
surprise,	1
but	1
smiled	1
politely.	1
"You	1
are	1
Mr.	1
Syme,	1
I	1
think,"	1
he	1
said.	1
Syme	1
bowed.	1
"And	1
you	1
are	1
the	1
Marquis	1
de	1
Saint	1
Eustache,"	1
he	1
said	1
gracefully.	1
"Permit	1
me	1
to	1
pull	1
your	1
nose."	1
He	1
leant	1
over	1
to	1
do	1
so,	1
but	1
the	1
Marquis	1
started	1
backwards,	1
upsetting	1
his	1
chair,	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
men	1
in	1
top	1
hats	1
held	1
Syme	1
back	1
by	1
the	1
shoulders.	1
"This	1
man	1
has	1
insulted	1
me!"	1
said	1
Syme,	1
with	1
gestures	1
of	1
explanation.	1
"Insulted	1
you?"	1
cried	1
the	1
gentleman	1
with	1
the	1
red	1
rosette,	1
"when?"	1
"Oh,	1
just	1
now,"	1
said	1
Syme	1
recklessly.	1
"He	1
insulted	1
my	1
mother."	1
"Insulted	1
your	1
mother!"	1
exclaimed	1
the	1
gentleman	1
incredulously.	1
"Well,	1
anyhow,"	1
said	1
Syme,	1
conceding	1
a	1
point,	1
"my	1
aunt."	1
"But	1
how	1
can	1
the	1
Marquis	1
have	1
insulted	1
your	1
aunt	1
just	1
now?"	1
said	1
the	1
second	1
gentleman	1
with	1
some	1
legitimate	1
wonder.	1
"He	1
has	1
been	1
sitting	1
here	1
all	1
the	1
time."	1
"Ah,	1
it	1
was	1
what	1
he	1
said!"	1
said	1
Syme	1
darkly.	1
"I	1
said	1
nothing	1
at	1
all,"	1
said	1
the	1
Marquis,	1
"except	1
something	1
about	1
the	1
band.	1
I	1
only	1
said	1
that	1
I	1
liked	1
Wagner	1
played	1
well."	1
"It	1
was	1
an	1
allusion	1
to	1
my	1
family,"	1
said	1
Syme	1
firmly.	1
"My	1
aunt	1
played	1
Wagner	1
badly.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
painful	1
subject.	1
We	1
are	1
always	1
being	1
insulted	1
about	1
it."	1
"This	1
seems	1
most	1
extraordinary,"	1
said	1
the	1
gentleman	1
who	1
was	1
decore,	1
looking	1
doubtfully	1
at	1
the	1
Marquis.	1
"Oh,	1
I	1
assure	1
you,"	1
said	1
Syme	1
earnestly,	1
"the	1
whole	1
of	1
your	1
conversation	1
was	1
simply	1
packed	1
with	1
sinister	1
allusions	1
to	1
my	1
aunt's	1
weaknesses."	1
"This	1
is	1
nonsense!"	1
said	1
the	1
second	1
gentleman.	1
"I	1
for	1
one	1
have	1
said	1
nothing	1
for	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
except	1
that	1
I	1
liked	1
the	1
singing	1
of	1
that	1
girl	1
with	1
black	1
hair."	1
"Well,	1
there	1
you	1
are	1
again!"	1
said	1
Syme	1
indignantly.	1
"My	1
aunt's	1
was	1
red."	1
"It	1
seems	1
to	1
me,"	1
said	1
the	1
other,	1
"that	1
you	1
are	1
simply	1
seeking	1
a	1
pretext	1
to	1
insult	1
the	1
Marquis."	1
"By	1
George!"	1
said	1
Syme,	1
facing	1
round	1
and	1
looking	1
at	1
him,	1
"what	1
a	1
clever	1
chap	1
you	1
are!"	1
The	1
Marquis	1
started	1
up	1
with	1
eyes	1
flaming	1
like	1
a	1
tiger's.	1
"Seeking	1
a	1
quarrel	1
with	1
me!"	1
he	1
cried.	1
"Seeking	1
a	1
fight	1
with	1
me!	1
By	1
God!	1
there	1
was	1
never	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
to	1
seek	1
long.	1
These	1
gentlemen	1
will	1
perhaps	1
act	1
for	1
me.	1
There	1
are	1
still	1
four	1
hours	1
of	1
daylight.	1
Let	1
us	1
fight	1
this	1
evening."	1
Syme	1
bowed	1
with	1
a	1
quite	1
beautiful	1
graciousness.	1
"Marquis,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"your	1
action	1
is	1
worthy	1
of	1
your	1
fame	1
and	1
blood.	1
Permit	1
me	1
to	1
consult	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
with	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
in	1
whose	1
hands	1
I	1
shall	1
place	1
myself."	1
In	1
three	1
long	1
strides	1
he	1
rejoined	1
his	1
companions,	1
and	1
they,	1
who	1
had	1
seen	1
his	1
champagne-inspired	1
attack	1
and	1
listened	1
to	1
his	1
idiotic	1
explanations,	1
were	1
quite	1
startled	1
at	1
the	1
look	1
of	1
him.	1
For	1
now	1
that	1
he	1
came	1
back	1
to	1
them	1
he	1
was	1
quite	1
sober,	1
a	1
little	1
pale,	1
and	1
he	1
spoke	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice	1
of	1
passionate	1
practicality.	1
"I	1
have	1
done	1
it,"	1
he	1
said	1
hoarsely.	1
"I	1
have	1
fixed	1
a	1
fight	1
on	1
the	1
beast.	1
But	1
look	1
here,	1
and	1
listen	1
carefully.	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
time	1
for	1
talk.	1
You	1
are	1
my	1
seconds,	1
and	1
everything	1
must	1
come	1
from	1
you.	1
Now	1
you	1
must	1
insist,	1
and	1
insist	1
absolutely,	1
on	1
the	1
duel	1
coming	1
off	1
after	1
seven	1
tomorrow,	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
give	1
me	1
the	1
chance	1
of	1
preventing	1
him	1
from	1
catching	1
the	1
7.45	1
for	1
Paris.	1
If	1
he	1
misses	1
that	1
he	1
misses	1
his	1
crime.	1
He	1
can't	1
refuse	1
to	1
meet	1
you	1
on	1
such	1
a	1
small	1
point	1
of	1
time	1
and	1
place.	1
But	1
this	1
is	1
what	1
he	1
will	1
do.	1
He	1
will	1
choose	1
a	1
field	1
somewhere	1
near	1
a	1
wayside	1
station,	1
where	1
he	1
can	1
pick	1
up	1
the	1
train.	1
He	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
swordsman,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
trust	1
to	1
killing	1
me	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
catch	1
it.	1
But	1
I	1
can	1
fence	1
well	1
too,	1
and	1
I	1
think	1
I	1
can	1
keep	1
him	1
in	1
play,	1
at	1
any	1
rate,	1
until	1
the	1
train	1
is	1
lost.	1
Then	1
perhaps	1
he	1
may	1
kill	1
me	1
to	1
console	1
his	1
feelings.	1
You	1
understand?	1
Very	1
well	1
then,	1
let	1
me	1
introduce	1
you	1
to	1
some	1
charming	1
friends	1
of	1
mine,"	1
and	1
leading	1
them	1
quickly	1
across	1
the	1
parade,	1
he	1
presented	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
Marquis's	1
seconds	1
by	1
two	1
very	1
aristocratic	1
names	1
of	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
previously	1
heard.	1
Syme	1
was	1
subject	1
to	1
spasms	1
of	1
singular	1
common	1
sense,	1
not	1
otherwise	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
character.	1
They	1
were	1
(as	1
he	1
said	1
of	1
his	1
impulse	1
about	1
the	1
spectacles)	1
poetic	1
intuitions,	1
and	1
they	1
sometimes	1
rose	1
to	1
the	1
exaltation	1
of	1
prophecy.	1
He	1
had	1
correctly	1
calculated	1
in	1
this	1
case	1
the	1
policy	1
of	1
his	1
opponent.	1
When	1
the	1
Marquis	1
was	1
informed	1
by	1
his	1
seconds	1
that	1
Syme	1
could	1
only	1
fight	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
he	1
must	1
fully	1
have	1
realised	1
that	1
an	1
obstacle	1
had	1
suddenly	1
arisen	1
between	1
him	1
and	1
his	1
bomb-throwing	1
business	1
in	1
the	1
capital.	1
Naturally	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
explain	1
this	1
objection	1
to	1
his	1
friends,	1
so	1
he	1
chose	1
the	1
course	1
which	1
Syme	1
had	1
predicted.	1
He	1
induced	1
his	1
seconds	1
to	1
settle	1
on	1
a	1
small	1
meadow	1
not	1
far	1
from	1
the	1
railway,	1
and	1
he	1
trusted	1
to	1
the	1
fatality	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
engagement.	1
When	1
he	1
came	1
down	1
very	1
coolly	1
to	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
honour,	1
no	1
one	1
could	1
have	1
guessed	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
any	1
anxiety	1
about	1
a	1
journey;	1
his	1
hands	1
were	1
in	1
his	1
pockets,	1
his	1
straw	1
hat	1
on	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
his	1
head,	1
his	1
handsome	1
face	1
brazen	1
in	1
the	1
sun.	1
But	1
it	1
might	1
have	1
struck	1
a	1
stranger	1
as	1
odd	1
that	1
there	1
appeared	1
in	1
his	1
train,	1
not	1
only	1
his	1
seconds	1
carrying	1
the	1
sword-case,	1
but	1
two	1
of	1
his	1
servants	1
carrying	1
a	1
portmanteau	1
and	1
a	1
luncheon	1
basket.	1
Early	1
as	1
was	1
the	1
hour,	1
the	1
sun	1
soaked	1
everything	1
in	1
warmth,	1
and	1
Syme	1
was	1
vaguely	1
surprised	1
to	1
see	1
so	1
many	1
spring	1
flowers	1
burning	1
gold	1
and	1
silver	1
in	1
the	1
tall	1
grass	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
whole	1
company	1
stood	1
almost	1
knee-deep.	1
With	1
the	1
exception	1
of	1
the	1
Marquis,	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
were	1
in	1
sombre	1
and	1
solemn	1
morning-dress,	1
with	1
hats	1
like	1
black	1
chimney-pots;	1
the	1
little	1
Doctor	1
especially,	1
with	1
the	1
addition	1
of	1
his	1
black	1
spectacles,	1
looked	1
like	1
an	1
undertaker	1
in	1
a	1
farce.	1
Syme	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
feeling	1
a	1
comic	1
contrast	1
between	1
this	1
funereal	1
church	1
parade	1
of	1
apparel	1
and	1
the	1
rich	1
and	1
glistening	1
meadow,	1
growing	1
wild	1
flowers	1
everywhere.	1
But,	1
indeed,	1
this	1
comic	1
contrast	1
between	1
the	1
yellow	1
blossoms	1
and	1
the	1
black	1
hats	1
was	1
but	1
a	1
symbol	1
of	1
the	1
tragic	1
contrast	1
between	1
the	1
yellow	1
blossoms	1
and	1
the	1
black	1
business.	1
On	1
his	1
right	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
wood;	1
far	1
away	1
to	1
his	1
left	1
lay	1
the	1
long	1
curve	1
of	1
the	1
railway	1
line,	1
which	1
he	1
was,	1
so	1
to	1
speak,	1
guarding	1
from	1
the	1
Marquis,	1
whose	1
goal	1
and	1
escape	1
it	1
was.	1
In	1
front	1
of	1
him,	1
behind	1
the	1
black	1
group	1
of	1
his	1
opponents,	1
he	1
could	1
see,	1
like	1
a	1
tinted	1
cloud,	1
a	1
small	1
almond	1
bush	1
in	1
flower	1
against	1
the	1
faint	1
line	1
of	1
the	1
sea.	1
The	1
member	1
of	1
the	1
Legion	1
of	1
Honour,	1
whose	1
name	1
it	1
seemed	1
was	1
Colonel	1
Ducroix,	1
approached	1
the	1
Professor	1
and	1
Dr.	1
Bull	1
with	1
great	1
politeness,	1
and	1
suggested	1
that	1
the	1
play	1
should	1
terminate	1
with	1
the	1
first	1
considerable	1
hurt.	1
Dr.	1
Bull,	1
however,	1
having	1
been	1
carefully	1
coached	1
by	1
Syme	1
upon	1
this	1
point	1
of	1
policy,	1
insisted,	1
with	1
great	1
dignity	1
and	1
in	1
very	1
bad	1
French,	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
continue	1
until	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
combatants	1
was	1
disabled.	1
Syme	1
had	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
avoid	1
disabling	1
the	1
Marquis	1
and	1
prevent	1
the	1
Marquis	1
from	1
disabling	1
him	1
for	1
at	1
least	1
twenty	1
minutes.	1
In	1
twenty	1
minutes	1
the	1
Paris	1
train	1
would	1
have	1
gone	1
by.	1
"To	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
well-known	1
skill	1
and	1
valour	1
of	1
Monsieur	1
de	1
St.	1
Eustache,"	1
said	1
the	1
Professor	1
solemnly,	1
"it	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
indifference	1
which	1
method	1
is	1
adopted,	1
and	1
our	1
principal	1
has	1
strong	1
reasons	1
for	1
demanding	1
the	1
longer	1
encounter,	1
reasons	1
the	1
delicacy	1
of	1
which	1
prevent	1
me	1
from	1
being	1
explicit,	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
just	1
and	1
honourable	1
nature	1
of	1
which	1
I	1
can--"	1
"Peste!"	1
broke	1
from	1
the	1
Marquis	1
behind,	1
whose	1
face	1
had	1
suddenly	1
darkened,	1
"let	1
us	1
stop	1
talking	1
and	1
begin,"	1
and	1
he	1
slashed	1
off	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
a	1
tall	1
flower	1
with	1
his	1
stick.	1
Syme	1
understood	1
his	1
rude	1
impatience	1
and	1
instinctively	1
looked	1
over	1
his	1
shoulder	1
to	1
see	1
whether	1
the	1
train	1
was	1
coming	1
in	1
sight.	1
But	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
smoke	1
on	1
the	1
horizon.	1
Colonel	1
Ducroix	1
knelt	1
down	1
and	1
unlocked	1
the	1
case,	1
taking	1
out	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
twin	1
swords,	1
which	1
took	1
the	1
sunlight	1
and	1
turned	1
to	1
two	1
streaks	1
of	1
white	1
fire.	1
He	1
offered	1
one	1
to	1
the	1
Marquis,	1
who	1
snatched	1
it	1
without	1
ceremony,	1
and	1
another	1
to	1
Syme,	1
who	1
took	1
it,	1
bent	1
it,	1
and	1
poised	1
it	1
with	1
as	1
much	1
delay	1
as	1
was	1
consistent	1
with	1
dignity.	1
Then	1
the	1
Colonel	1
took	1
out	1
another	1
pair	1
of	1
blades,	1
and	1
taking	1
one	1
himself	1
and	1
giving	1
another	1
to	1
Dr.	1
Bull,	1
proceeded	1
to	1
place	1
the	1
men.	1
Both	1
combatants	1
had	1
thrown	1
off	1
their	1
coats	1
and	1
waistcoats,	1
and	1
stood	1
sword	1
in	1
hand.	1
The	1
seconds	1
stood	1
on	1
each	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
line	1
of	1
fight	1
with	1
drawn	1
swords	1
also,	1
but	1
still	1
sombre	1
in	1
their	1
dark	1
frock-coats	1
and	1
hats.	1
The	1
principals	1
saluted.	1
The	1
Colonel	1
said	1
quietly,	1
"Engage!"	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
blades	1
touched	1
and	1
tingled.	1
When	1
the	1
jar	1
of	1
the	1
joined	1
iron	1
ran	1
up	1
Syme's	1
arm,	1
all	1
the	1
fantastic	1
fears	1
that	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
this	1
story	1
fell	1
from	1
him	1
like	1
dreams	1
from	1
a	1
man	1
waking	1
up	1
in	1
bed.	1
He	1
remembered	1
them	1
clearly	1
and	1
in	1
order	1
as	1
mere	1
delusions	1
of	1
the	1
nerves--how	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
Professor	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
tyrannic	1
accidents	1
of	1
nightmare,	1
and	1
how	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
Doctor	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
airless	1
vacuum	1
of	1
science.	1
The	1
first	1
was	1
the	1
old	1
fear	1
that	1
any	1
miracle	1
might	1
happen,	1
the	1
second	1
the	1
more	1
hopeless	1
modern	1
fear	1
that	1
no	1
miracle	1
can	1
ever	1
happen.	1
But	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
these	1
fears	1
were	1
fancies,	1
for	1
he	1
found	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
fact	1
of	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
death,	1
with	1
its	1
coarse	1
and	1
pitiless	1
common	1
sense.	1
He	1
felt	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
dreamed	1
all	1
night	1
of	1
falling	1
over	1
precipices,	1
and	1
had	1
woke	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
morning	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
hanged.	1
For	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
the	1
sunlight	1
run	1
down	1
the	1
channel	1
of	1
his	1
foe's	1
foreshortened	1
blade,	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
felt	1
the	1
two	1
tongues	1
of	1
steel	1
touch,	1
vibrating	1
like	1
two	1
living	1
things,	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
his	1
enemy	1
was	1
a	1
terrible	1
fighter,	1
and	1
that	1
probably	1
his	1
last	1
hour	1
had	1
come.	1
He	1
felt	1
a	1
strange	1
and	1
vivid	1
value	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
earth	1
around	1
him,	1
in	1
the	1
grass	1
under	1
his	1
feet;	1
he	1
felt	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
life	1
in	1
all	1
living	1
things.	1
He	1
could	1
almost	1
fancy	1
that	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
grass	1
growing;	1
he	1
could	1
almost	1
fancy	1
that	1
even	1
as	1
he	1
stood	1
fresh	1
flowers	1
were	1
springing	1
up	1
and	1
breaking	1
into	1
blossom	1
in	1
the	1
meadow--flowers	1
blood	1
red	1
and	1
burning	1
gold	1
and	1
blue,	1
fulfilling	1
the	1
whole	1
pageant	1
of	1
the	1
spring.	1
And	1
whenever	1
his	1
eyes	1
strayed	1
for	1
a	1
flash	1
from	1
the	1
calm,	1
staring,	1
hypnotic	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
Marquis,	1
they	1
saw	1
the	1
little	1
tuft	1
of	1
almond	1
tree	1
against	1
the	1
sky-line.	1
He	1
had	1
the	1
feeling	1
that	1
if	1
by	1
some	1
miracle	1
he	1
escaped	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
ready	1
to	1
sit	1
for	1
ever	1
before	1
that	1
almond	1
tree,	1
desiring	1
nothing	1
else	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
But	1
while	1
earth	1
and	1
sky	1
and	1
everything	1
had	1
the	1
living	1
beauty	1
of	1
a	1
thing	1
lost,	1
the	1
other	1
half	1
of	1
his	1
head	1
was	1
as	1
clear	1
as	1
glass,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
parrying	1
his	1
enemy's	1
point	1
with	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
clockwork	1
skill	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
hardly	1
supposed	1
himself	1
capable.	1
Once	1
his	1
enemy's	1
point	1
ran	1
along	1
his	1
wrist,	1
leaving	1
a	1
slight	1
streak	1
of	1
blood,	1
but	1
it	1
either	1
was	1
not	1
noticed	1
or	1
was	1
tacitly	1
ignored.	1
Every	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
riposted,	1
and	1
once	1
or	1
twice	1
he	1
could	1
almost	1
fancy	1
that	1
he	1
felt	1
his	1
point	1
go	1
home,	1
but	1
as	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
blood	1
on	1
blade	1
or	1
shirt	1
he	1
supposed	1
he	1
was	1
mistaken.	1
Then	1
came	1
an	1
interruption	1
and	1
a	1
change.	1
At	1
the	1
risk	1
of	1
losing	1
all,	1
the	1
Marquis,	1
interrupting	1
his	1
quiet	1
stare,	1
flashed	1
one	1
glance	1
over	1
his	1
shoulder	1
at	1
the	1
line	1
of	1
railway	1
on	1
his	1
right.	1
Then	1
he	1
turned	1
on	1
Syme	1
a	1
face	1
transfigured	1
to	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
fiend,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
fight	1
as	1
if	1
with	1
twenty	1
weapons.	1
The	1
attack	1
came	1
so	1
fast	1
and	1
furious,	1
that	1
the	1
one	1
shining	1
sword	1
seemed	1
a	1
shower	1
of	1
shining	1
arrows.	1
Syme	1
had	1
no	1
chance	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
railway;	1
but	1
also	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
need.	1
He	1
could	1
guess	1
the	1
reason	1
of	1
the	1
Marquis's	1
sudden	1
madness	1
of	1
battle--the	1
Paris	1
train	1
was	1
in	1
sight.	1
But	1
the	1
Marquis's	1
morbid	1
energy	1
over-reached	1
itself.	1
Twice	1
Syme,	1
parrying,	1
knocked	1
his	1
opponent's	1
point	1
far	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
fighting	1
circle;	1
and	1
the	1
third	1
time	1
his	1
riposte	1
was	1
so	1
rapid,	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
doubt	1
about	1
the	1
hit	1
this	1
time.	1
Syme's	1
sword	1
actually	1
bent	1
under	1
the	1
weight	1
of	1
the	1
Marquis's	1
body,	1
which	1
it	1
had	1
pierced.	1
Syme	1
was	1
as	1
certain	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
stuck	1
his	1
blade	1
into	1
his	1
enemy	1
as	1
a	1
gardener	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
stuck	1
his	1
spade	1
into	1
the	1
ground.	1
Yet	1
the	1
Marquis	1
sprang	1
back	1
from	1
the	1
stroke	1
without	1
a	1
stagger,	1
and	1
Syme	1
stood	1
staring	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
sword-point	1
like	1
an	1
idiot.	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
blood	1
on	1
it	1
at	1
all.	1
There	1
was	1
an	1
instant	1
of	1
rigid	1
silence,	1
and	1
then	1
Syme	1
in	1
his	1
turn	1
fell	1
furiously	1
on	1
the	1
other,	1
filled	1
with	1
a	1
flaming	1
curiosity.	1
The	1
Marquis	1
was	1
probably,	1
in	1
a	1
general	1
sense,	1
a	1
better	1
fencer	1
than	1
he,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
surmised	1
at	1
the	1
beginning,	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
the	1
Marquis	1
seemed	1
distraught	1
and	1
at	1
a	1
disadvantage.	1
He	1
fought	1
wildly	1
and	1
even	1
weakly,	1
and	1
he	1
constantly	1
looked	1
away	1
at	1
the	1
railway	1
line,	1
almost	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
feared	1
the	1
train	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
pointed	1
steel.	1
Syme,	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
hand,	1
fought	1
fiercely	1
but	1
still	1
carefully,	1
in	1
an	1
intellectual	1
fury,	1
eager	1
to	1
solve	1
the	1
riddle	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
bloodless	1
sword.	1
For	1
this	1
purpose,	1
he	1
aimed	1
less	1
at	1
the	1
Marquis's	1
body,	1
and	1
more	1
at	1
his	1
throat	1
and	1
head.	1
A	1
minute	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
afterwards	1
he	1
felt	1
his	1
point	1
enter	1
the	1
man's	1
neck	1
below	1
the	1
jaw.	1
It	1
came	1
out	1
clean.	1
Half	1
mad,	1
he	1
thrust	1
again,	1
and	1
made	1
what	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
bloody	1
scar	1
on	1
the	1
Marquis's	1
cheek.	1
But	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
scar.	1
For	1
one	1
moment	1
the	1
heaven	1
of	1
Syme	1
again	1
grew	1
black	1
with	1
supernatural	1
terrors.	1
Surely	1
the	1
man	1
had	1
a	1
charmed	1
life.	1
But	1
this	1
new	1
spiritual	1
dread	1
was	1
a	1
more	1
awful	1
thing	1
than	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
mere	1
spiritual	1
topsy-turvydom	1
symbolised	1
by	1
the	1
paralytic	1
who	1
pursued	1
him.	1
The	1
Professor	1
was	1
only	1
a	1
goblin;	1
this	1
man	1
was	1
a	1
devil--perhaps	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
Devil!	1
Anyhow,	1
this	1
was	1
certain,	1
that	1
three	1
times	1
had	1
a	1
human	1
sword	1
been	1
driven	1
into	1
him	1
and	1
made	1
no	1
mark.	1
When	1
Syme	1
had	1
that	1
thought	1
he	1
drew	1
himself	1
up,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
good	1
in	1
him	1
sang	1
high	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
air	1
as	1
a	1
high	1
wind	1
sings	1
in	1
the	1
trees.	1
He	1
thought	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
human	1
things	1
in	1
his	1
story--of	1
the	1
Chinese	1
lanterns	1
in	1
Saffron	1
Park,	1
of	1
the	1
girl's	1
red	1
hair	1
in	1
the	1
garden,	1
of	1
the	1
honest,	1
beer-swilling	1
sailors	1
down	1
by	1
the	1
dock,	1
of	1
his	1
loyal	1
companions	1
standing	1
by.	1
Perhaps	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
chosen	1
as	1
a	1
champion	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
fresh	1
and	1
kindly	1
things	1
to	1
cross	1
swords	1
with	1
the	1
enemy	1
of	1
all	1
creation.	1
"After	1
all,"	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself,	1
"I	1
am	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
devil;	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
man.	1
I	1
can	1
do	1
the	1
one	1
thing	1
which	1
Satan	1
himself	1
cannot	1
do--I	1
can	1
die,"	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
word	1
went	1
through	1
his	1
head,	1
he	1
heard	1
a	1
faint	1
and	1
far-off	1
hoot,	1
which	1
would	1
soon	1
be	1
the	1
roar	1
of	1
the	1
Paris	1
train.	1
He	1
fell	1
to	1
fighting	1
again	1
with	1
a	1
supernatural	1
levity,	1
like	1
a	1
Mohammedan	1
panting	1
for	1
Paradise.	1
As	1
the	1
train	1
came	1
nearer	1
and	1
nearer	1
he	1
fancied	1
he	1
could	1
see	1
people	1
putting	1
up	1
the	1
floral	1
arches	1
in	1
Paris;	1
he	1
joined	1
in	1
the	1
growing	1
noise	1
and	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
Republic	1
whose	1
gate	1
he	1
was	1
guarding	1
against	1
Hell.	1
His	1
thoughts	1
rose	1
higher	1
and	1
higher	1
with	1
the	1
rising	1
roar	1
of	1
the	1
train,	1
which	1
ended,	1
as	1
if	1
proudly,	1
in	1
a	1
long	1
and	1
piercing	1
whistle.	1
The	1
train	1
stopped.	1
Suddenly,	1
to	1
the	1
astonishment	1
of	1
everyone	1
the	1
Marquis	1
sprang	1
back	1
quite	1
out	1
of	1
sword	1
reach	1
and	1
threw	1
down	1
his	1
sword.	1
The	1
leap	1
was	1
wonderful,	1
and	1
not	1
the	1
less	1
wonderful	1
because	1
Syme	1
had	1
plunged	1
his	1
sword	1
a	1
moment	1
before	1
into	1
the	1
man's	1
thigh.	1
"Stop!"	1
said	1
the	1
Marquis	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
that	1
compelled	1
a	1
momentary	1
obedience.	1
"I	1
want	1
to	1
say	1
something."	1
"What	1
is	1
the	1
matter?"	1
asked	1
Colonel	1
Ducroix,	1
staring.	1
"Has	1
there	1
been	1
foul	1
play?"	1
"There	1
has	1
been	1
foul	1
play	1
somewhere,"	1
said	1
Dr.	1
Bull,	1
who	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
pale.	1
"Our	1
principal	1
has	1
wounded	1
the	1
Marquis	1
four	1
times	1
at	1
least,	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
none	1
the	1
worse	1
."	1
The	1
Marquis	1
put	1
up	1
his	1
hand	1
with	1
a	1
curious	1
air	1
of	1
ghastly	1
patience.	1
"Please	1
let	1
me	1
speak,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"It	1
is	1
rather	1
important.	1
Mr.	1
Syme,"	1
he	1
continued,	1
turning	1
to	1
his	1
opponent,	1
"we	1
are	1
fighting	1
today,	1
if	1
I	1
remember	1
right,	1
because	1
you	1
expressed	1
a	1
wish	1
(which	1
I	1
thought	1
irrational)	1
to	1
pull	1
my	1
nose.	1
Would	1
you	1
oblige	1
me	1
by	1
pulling	1
my	1
nose	1
now	1
as	1
quickly	1
as	1
possible?	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
catch	1
a	1
train."	1
"I	1
protest	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
most	1
irregular,"	1
said	1
Dr.	1
Bull	1
indignantly.	1
"It	1
is	1
certainly	1
somewhat	1
opposed	1
to	1
precedent,"	1
said	1
Colonel	1
Ducroix,	1
looking	1
wistfully	1
at	1
his	1
principal.	1
"There	1
is,	1
I	1
think,	1
one	1
case	1
on	1
record	1
(Captain	1
Bellegarde	1
and	1
the	1
Baron	1
Zumpt)	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
weapons	1
were	1
changed	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
encounter	1
at	1
the	1
request	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
combatants.	1
But	1
one	1
can	1
hardly	1
call	1
one's	1
nose	1
a	1
weapon."	1
"Will	1
you	1
or	1
will	1
you	1
not	1
pull	1
my	1
nose?"	1
said	1
the	1
Marquis	1
in	1
exasperation.	1
"Come,	1
come,	1
Mr.	1
Syme!	1
You	1
wanted	1
to	1
do	1
it,	1
do	1
it!	1
You	1
can	1
have	1
no	1
conception	1
of	1
how	1
important	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
me.	1
Don't	1
be	1
so	1
selfish!	1
Pull	1
my	1
nose	1
at	1
once,	1
when	1
I	1
ask	1
you!"	1
and	1
he	1
bent	1
slightly	1
forward	1
with	1
a	1
fascinating	1
smile.	1
The	1
Paris	1
train,	1
panting	1
and	1
groaning,	1
had	1
grated	1
into	1
a	1
little	1
station	1
behind	1
the	1
neighbouring	1
hill.	1
Syme	1
had	1
the	1
feeling	1
he	1
had	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
had	1
in	1
these	1
adventures	1
--the	1
sense	1
that	1
a	1
horrible	1
and	1
sublime	1
wave	1
lifted	1
to	1
heaven	1
was	1
just	1
toppling	1
over.	1
Walking	1
in	1
a	1
world	1
he	1
half	1
understood,	1
he	1
took	1
two	1
paces	1
forward	1
and	1
seized	1
the	1
Roman	1
nose	1
of	1
this	1
remarkable	1
nobleman.	1
He	1
pulled	1
it	1
hard,	1
and	1
it	1
came	1
off	1
in	1
his	1
hand.	1
He	1
stood	1
for	1
some	1
seconds	1
with	1
a	1
foolish	1
solemnity,	1
with	1
the	1
pasteboard	1
proboscis	1
still	1
between	1
his	1
fingers,	1
looking	1
at	1
it,	1
while	1
the	1
sun	1
and	1
the	1
clouds	1
and	1
the	1
wooded	1
hills	1
looked	1
down	1
upon	1
this	1
imbecile	1
scene.	1
The	1
Marquis	1
broke	1
the	1
silence	1
in	1
a	1
loud	1
and	1
cheerful	1
voice.	1
"If	1
anyone	1
has	1
any	1
use	1
for	1
my	1
left	1
eyebrow,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"he	1
can	1
have	1
it.	1
Colonel	1
Ducroix,	1
do	1
accept	1
my	1
left	1
eyebrow!	1
It's	1
the	1
kind	1
of	1
thing	1
that	1
might	1
come	1
in	1
useful	1
any	1
day,"	1
and	1
he	1
gravely	1
tore	1
off	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
swarthy	1
Assyrian	1
brows,	1
bringing	1
about	1
half	1
his	1
brown	1
forehead	1
with	1
it,	1
and	1
politely	1
offered	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
Colonel,	1
who	1
stood	1
crimson	1
and	1
speechless	1
with	1
rage.	1
"If	1
I	1
had	1
known,"	1
he	1
spluttered,	1
"that	1
I	1
was	1
acting	1
for	1
a	1
poltroon	1
who	1
pads	1
himself	1
to	1
fight--"	1
"Oh,	1
I	1
know,	1
I	1
know!"	1
said	1
the	1
Marquis,	1
recklessly	1
throwing	1
various	1
parts	1
of	1
himself	1
right	1
and	1
left	1
about	1
the	1
field.	1
"You	1
are	1
making	1
a	1
mistake;	1
but	1
it	1
can't	1
be	1
explained	1
just	1
now.	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
the	1
train	1
has	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
station!"	1
"Yes,"	1
said	1
Dr.	1
Bull	1
fiercely,	1
"and	1
the	1
train	1
shall	1
go	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
station.	1
It	1
shall	1
go	1
out	1
without	1
you.	1
We	1
know	1
well	1
enough	1
for	1
what	1
devil's	1
work--"	1
The	1
mysterious	1
Marquis	1
lifted	1
his	1
hands	1
with	1
a	1
desperate	1
gesture.	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
strange	1
scarecrow	1
standing	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
sun	1
with	1
half	1
his	1
old	1
face	1
peeled	1
off,	1
and	1
half	1
another	1
face	1
glaring	1
and	1
grinning	1
from	1
underneath.	1
"Will	1
you	1
drive	1
me	1
mad?"	1
he	1
cried.	1
"The	1
train--"	1
"You	1
shall	1
not	1
go	1
by	1
the	1
train,"	1
said	1
Syme	1
firmly,	1
and	1
grasped	1
his	1
sword.	1
The	1
wild	1
figure	1
turned	1
towards	1
Syme,	1
and	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
gathering	1
itself	1
for	1
a	1
sublime	1
effort	1
before	1
speaking.	1
"You	1
great	1
fat,	1
blasted,	1
blear-eyed,	1
blundering,	1
thundering,	1
brainless,	1
Godforsaken,	1
doddering,	1
damned	1
fool!"	1
he	1
said	1
without	1
taking	1
breath.	1
"You	1
great	1
silly,	1
pink-faced,	1
towheaded	1
turnip!	1
You--"	1
"You	1
shall	1
not	1
go	1
by	1
this	1
train,"	1
repeated	1
Syme.	1
"And	1
why	1
the	1
infernal	1
blazes,"	1
roared	1
the	1
other,	1
"should	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
go	1
by	1
the	1
train?"	1
"We	1
know	1
all,"	1
said	1
the	1
Professor	1
sternly.	1
"You	1
are	1
going	1
to	1
Paris	1
to	1
throw	1
a	1
bomb!"	1
"Going	1
to	1
Jericho	1
to	1
throw	1
a	1
Jabberwock!"	1
cried	1
the	1
other,	1
tearing	1
his	1
hair,	1
which	1
came	1
off	1
easily.	1
"Have	1
you	1
all	1
got	1
softening	1
of	1
the	1
brain,	1
that	1
you	1
don't	1
realise	1
what	1
I	1
am?	1
Did	1
you	1
really	1
think	1
I	1
wanted	1
to	1
catch	1
that	1
train?	1
Twenty	1
Paris	1
trains	1
might	1
go	1
by	1
for	1
me.	1
Damn	1
Paris	1
trains!"	1
"Then	1
what	1
did	1
you	1
care	1
about?"	1
began	1
the	1
Professor.	1
"What	1
did	1
I	1
care	1
about?	1
I	1
didn't	1
care	1
about	1
catching	1
the	1
train;	1
I	1
cared	1
about	1
whether	1
the	1
train	1
caught	1
me,	1
and	1
now,	1
by	1
God!	1
it	1
has	1
caught	1
me."	1
"I	1
regret	1
to	1
inform	1
you,"	1
said	1
Syme	1
with	1
restraint,	1
"that	1
your	1
remarks	1
convey	1
no	1
impression	1
to	1
my	1
mind.	1
Perhaps	1
if	1
you	1
were	1
to	1
remove	1
the	1
remains	1
of	1
your	1
original	1
forehead	1
and	1
some	1
portion	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
once	1
your	1
chin,	1
your	1
meaning	1
would	1
become	1
clearer.	1
Mental	1
lucidity	1
fulfils	1
itself	1
in	1
many	1
ways.	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
mean	1
by	1
saying	1
that	1
the	1
train	1
has	1
caught	1
you?	1
It	1
may	1
be	1
my	1
literary	1
fancy,	1
but	1
somehow	1
I	1
feel	1
that	1
it	1
ought	1
to	1
mean	1
something."	1
"It	1
means	1
everything,"	1
said	1
the	1
other,	1
"and	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
everything.	1
Sunday	1
has	1
us	1
now	1
in	1
the	1
hollow	1
of	1
his	1
hand."	1
"Us!"	1
repeated	1
the	1
Professor,	1
as	1
if	1
stupefied.	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
mean	1
by	1
'us'?"	1
"The	1
police,	1
of	1
course!"	1
said	1
the	1
Marquis,	1
and	1
tore	1
off	1
his	1
scalp	1
and	1
half	1
his	1
face.	1
The	1
head	1
which	1
emerged	1
was	1
the	1
blonde,	1
well	1
brushed,	1
smooth-haired	1
head	1
which	1
is	1
common	1
in	1
the	1
English	1
constabulary,	1
but	1
the	1
face	1
was	1
terribly	1
pale.	1
"I	1
am	1
Inspector	1
Ratcliffe,"	1
he	1
said,	1
with	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
haste	1
that	1
verged	1
on	1
harshness.	1
"My	1
name	1
is	1
pretty	1
well	1
known	1
to	1
the	1
police,	1
and	1
I	1
can	1
see	1
well	1
enough	1
that	1
you	1
belong	1
to	1
them.	1
But	1
if	1
there	1
is	1
any	1
doubt	1
about	1
my	1
position,	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
card"	1
and	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
pull	1
a	1
blue	1
card	1
from	1
his	1
pocket.	1
The	1
Professor	1
gave	1
a	1
tired	1
gesture.	1
"Oh,	1
don't	1
show	1
it	1
us,"	1
he	1
said	1
wearily;	1
"we've	1
got	1
enough	1
of	1
them	1
to	1
equip	1
a	1
paper-chase."	1
The	1
little	1
man	1
named	1
Bull,	1
had,	1
like	1
many	1
men	1
who	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
a	1
mere	1
vivacious	1
vulgarity,	1
sudden	1
movements	1
of	1
good	1
taste.	1
Here	1
he	1
certainly	1
saved	1
the	1
situation.	1
In	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
this	1
staggering	1
transformation	1
scene	1
he	1
stepped	1
forward	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
gravity	1
and	1
responsibility	1
of	1
a	1
second,	1
and	1
addressed	1
the	1
two	1
seconds	1
of	1
the	1
Marquis.	1
"Gentlemen,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"we	1
all	1
owe	1
you	1
a	1
serious	1
apology;	1
but	1
I	1
assure	1
you	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
not	1
been	1
made	1
the	1
victims	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
low	1
joke	1
as	1
you	1
imagine,	1
or	1
indeed	1
of	1
anything	1
undignified	1
in	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
honour.	1
You	1
have	1
not	1
wasted	1
your	1
time;	1
you	1
have	1
helped	1
to	1
save	1
the	1
world.	1
We	1
are	1
not	1
buffoons,	1
but	1
very	1
desperate	1
men	1
at	1
war	1
with	1
a	1
vast	1
conspiracy.	1
A	1
secret	1
society	1
of	1
anarchists	1
is	1
hunting	1
us	1
like	1
hares;	1
not	1
such	1
unfortunate	1
madmen	1
as	1
may	1
here	1
or	1
there	1
throw	1
a	1
bomb	1
through	1
starvation	1
or	1
German	1
philosophy,	1
but	1
a	1
rich	1
and	1
powerful	1
and	1
fanatical	1
church,	1
a	1
church	1
of	1
eastern	1
pessimism,	1
which	1
holds	1
it	1
holy	1
to	1
destroy	1
mankind	1
like	1
vermin.	1
How	1
hard	1
they	1
hunt	1
us	1
you	1
can	1
gather	1
from	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
driven	1
to	1
such	1
disguises	1
as	1
those	1
for	1
which	1
I	1
apologise,	1
and	1
to	1
such	1
pranks	1
as	1
this	1
one	1
by	1
which	1
you	1
suffer.	1
"	1
The	1
younger	1
second	1
of	1
the	1
Marquis,	1
a	1
short	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
black	1
moustache,	1
bowed	1
politely,	1
and	1
said--	1
"Of	1
course,	1
I	1
accept	1
the	1
apology;	1
but	1
you	1
will	1
in	1
your	1
turn	1
forgive	1
me	1
if	1
I	1
decline	1
to	1
follow	1
you	1
further	1
into	1
your	1
difficulties,	1
and	1
permit	1
myself	1
to	1
say	1
good	1
morning!	1
The	1
sight	1
of	1
an	1
acquaintance	1
and	1
distinguished	1
fellow-townsman	1
coming	1
to	1
pieces	1
in	1
the	1
open	1
air	1
is	1
unusual,	1
and,	1
upon	1
the	1
whole,	1
sufficient	1
for	1
one	1
day.	1
Colonel	1
Ducroix,	1
I	1
would	1
in	1
no	1
way	1
influence	1
your	1
actions,	1
but	1
if	1
you	1
feel	1
with	1
me	1
that	1
our	1
present	1
society	1
is	1
a	1
little	1
abnormal,	1
I	1
am	1
now	1
going	1
to	1
walk	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
town."	1
Colonel	1
Ducroix	1
moved	1
mechanically,	1
but	1
then	1
tugged	1
abruptly	1
at	1
his	1
white	1
moustache	1
and	1
broke	1
out--	1
"No,	1
by	1
George!	1
I	1
won't.	1
If	1
these	1
gentlemen	1
are	1
really	1
in	1
a	1
mess	1
with	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
low	1
wreckers	1
like	1
that,	1
I'll	1
see	1
them	1
through	1
it.	1
I	1
have	1
fought	1
for	1
France,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
hard	1
if	1
I	1
can't	1
fight	1
for	1
civilization."	1
Dr.	1
Bull	1
took	1
off	1
his	1
hat	1
and	1
waved	1
it,	1
cheering	1
as	1
at	1
a	1
public	1
meeting.	1
"Don't	1
make	1
too	1
much	1
noise,"	1
said	1
Inspector	1
Ratcliffe,	1
"Sunday	1
may	1
hear	1
you."	1
"Sunday!"	1
cried	1
Bull,	1
and	1
dropped	1
his	1
hat.	1
"Yes,"	1
retorted	1
Ratcliffe,	1
"he	1
may	1
be	1
with	1
them."	1
"With	1
whom?"	1
asked	1
Syme.	1
"With	1
the	1
people	1
out	1
of	1
that	1
train,"	1
said	1
the	1
other.	1
"What	1
you	1
say	1
seems	1
utterly	1
wild,"	1
began	1
Syme.	1
"Why,	1
as	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
fact--But,	1
my	1
God,"	1
he	1
cried	1
out	1
suddenly,	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
sees	1
an	1
explosion	1
a	1
long	1
way	1
off,	1
"by	1
God!	1
if	1
this	1
is	1
true	1
the	1
whole	1
bally	1
lot	1
of	1
us	1
on	1
the	1
Anarchist	1
Council	1
were	1
against	1
anarchy!	1
Every	1
born	1
man	1
was	1
a	1
detective	1
except	1
the	1
President	1
and	1
his	1
personal	1
secretary.	1
What	1
can	1
it	1
mean?"	1
"Mean!"	1
said	1
the	1
new	1
policeman	1
with	1
incredible	1
violence.	1
"It	1
means	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
struck	1
dead!	1
Don't	1
you	1
know	1
Sunday?	1
Don't	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
his	1
jokes	1
are	1
always	1
so	1
big	1
and	1
simple	1
that	1
one	1
has	1
never	1
thought	1
of	1
them?	1
Can	1
you	1
think	1
of	1
anything	1
more	1
like	1
Sunday	1
than	1
this,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
put	1
all	1
his	1
powerful	1
enemies	1
on	1
the	1
Supreme	1
Council,	1
and	1
then	1
take	1
care	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
supreme?	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
he	1
has	1
bought	1
every	1
trust,	1
he	1
has	1
captured	1
every	1
cable,	1
he	1
has	1
control	1
of	1
every	1
railway	1
line--especially	1
of	1
that	1
railway	1
line!"	1
and	1
he	1
pointed	1
a	1
shaking	1
finger	1
towards	1
the	1
small	1
wayside	1
station.	1
"The	1
whole	1
movement	1
was	1
controlled	1
by	1
him;	1
half	1
the	1
world	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
rise	1
for	1
him.	1
But	1
there	1
were	1
just	1
five	1
people,	1
perhaps,	1
who	1
would	1
have	1
resisted	1
him	1
.	1
.	1
.	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
devil	1
put	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
Supreme	1
Council,	1
to	1
waste	1
their	1
time	1
in	1
watching	1
each	1
other.	1
Idiots	1
that	1
we	1
are,	1
he	1
planned	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
our	1
idiocies!	1
Sunday	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
Professor	1
would	1
chase	1
Syme	1
through	1
London,	1
and	1
that	1
Syme	1
would	1
fight	1
me	1
in	1
France.	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
combining	1
great	1
masses	1
of	1
capital,	1
and	1
seizing	1
great	1
lines	1
of	1
telegraphy,	1
while	1
we	1
five	1
idiots	1
were	1
running	1
after	1
each	1
other	1
like	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
confounded	1
babies	1
playing	1
blind	1
man's	1
buff."	1
"Well?"	1
asked	1
Syme	1
with	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
steadiness.	1
"Well,"	1
replied	1
the	1
other	1
with	1
sudden	1
serenity,	1
"he	1
has	1
found	1
us	1
playing	1
blind	1
man's	1
buff	1
today	1
in	1
a	1
field	1
of	1
great	1
rustic	1
beauty	1
and	1
extreme	1
solitude.	1
He	1
has	1
probably	1
captured	1
the	1
world;	1
it	1
only	1
remains	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
capture	1
this	1
field	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
fools	1
in	1
it.	1
And	1
since	1
you	1
really	1
want	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
was	1
my	1
objection	1
to	1
the	1
arrival	1
of	1
that	1
train,	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
you.	1
My	1
objection	1
was	1
that	1
Sunday	1
or	1
his	1
Secretary	1
has	1
just	1
this	1
moment	1
got	1
out	1
of	1
it."	1
Syme	1
uttered	1
an	1
involuntary	1
cry,	1
and	1
they	1
all	1
turned	1
their	1
eyes	1
towards	1
the	1
far-off	1
station.	1
It	1
was	1
quite	1
true	1
that	1
a	1
considerable	1
bulk	1
of	1
people	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
moving	1
in	1
their	1
direction.	1
But	1
they	1
were	1
too	1
distant	1
to	1
be	1
distinguished	1
in	1
any	1
way.	1
"It	1
was	1
a	1
habit	1
of	1
the	1
late	1
Marquis	1
de	1
St.	1
Eustache,"	1
said	1
the	1
new	1
policeman,	1
producing	1
a	1
leather	1
case,	1
"always	1
to	1
carry	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
opera	1
glasses.	1
Either	1
the	1
President	1
or	1
the	1
Secretary	1
is	1
coming	1
after	1
us	1
with	1
that	1
mob.	1
They	1
have	1
caught	1
us	1
in	1
a	1
nice	1
quiet	1
place	1
where	1
we	1
are	1
under	1
no	1
temptations	1
to	1
break	1
our	1
oaths	1
by	1
calling	1
the	1
police.	1
Dr.	1
Bull,	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
suspicion	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
see	1
better	1
through	1
these	1
than	1
through	1
your	1
own	1
highly	1
decorative	1
spectacles."	1
He	1
handed	1
the	1
field-glasses	1
to	1
the	1
Doctor,	1
who	1
immediately	1
took	1
off	1
his	1
spectacles	1
and	1
put	1
the	1
apparatus	1
to	1
his	1
eyes.	1
"It	1
cannot	1
be	1
as	1
bad	1
as	1
you	1
say,"	1
said	1
the	1
Professor,	1
somewhat	1
shaken.	1
"There	1
are	1
a	1
good	1
number	1
of	1
them	1
certainly,	1
but	1
they	1
may	1
easily	1
be	1
ordinary	1
tourists."	1
"Do	1
ordinary	1
tourists,"	1
asked	1
Bull,	1
with	1
the	1
fieldglasses	1
to	1
his	1
eyes,	1
"wear	1
black	1
masks	1
half-way	1
down	1
the	1
face?"	1
Syme	1
almost	1
tore	1
the	1
glasses	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
looked	1
through	1
them.	1
Most	1
men	1
in	1
the	1
advancing	1
mob	1
really	1
looked	1
ordinary	1
enough;	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
quite	1
true	1
that	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
of	1
the	1
leaders	1
in	1
front	1
wore	1
black	1
half-masks	1
almost	1
down	1
to	1
their	1
mouths.	1
This	1
disguise	1
is	1
very	1
complete,	1
especially	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
distance,	1
and	1
Syme	1
found	1
it	1
impossible	1
to	1
conclude	1
anything	1
from	1
the	1
clean-shaven	1
jaws	1
and	1
chins	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
talking	1
in	1
the	1
front.	1
But	1
presently	1
as	1
they	1
talked	1
they	1
all	1
smiled	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
smiled	1
on	1
one	1
side.	1
CHAPTER	1
XI	1
THE	1
CRIMINALS	1
CHASE	1
THE	1
POLICE	1
SYME	1
put	1
the	1
field-glasses	1
from	1
his	1
eyes	1
with	1
an	1
almost	1
ghastly	1
relief.	1
"The	1
President	1
is	1
not	1
with	1
them,	1
anyhow,"	1
he	1
said,	1
and	1
wiped	1
his	1
forehead.	1
"But	1
surely	1
they	1
are	1
right	1
away	1
on	1
the	1
horizon,"	1
said	1
the	1
bewildered	1
Colonel,	1
blinking	1
and	1
but	1
half	1
recovered	1
from	1
Bull's	1
hasty	1
though	1
polite	1
explanation.	1
"Could	1
you	1
possibly	1
know	1
your	1
President	1
among	1
all	1
those	1
people?"	1
"Could	1
I	1
know	1
a	1
white	1
elephant	1
among	1
all	1
those	1
people!"	1
answered	1
Syme	1
somewhat	1
irritably.	1
"As	1
you	1
very	1
truly	1
say,	1
they	1
are	1
on	1
the	1
horizon;	1
but	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
walking	1
with	1
them	1
.	1
.	1
.	1
by	1
God!	1
I	1
believe	1
this	1
ground	1
would	1
shake."	1
After	1
an	1
instant's	1
pause	1
the	1
new	1
man	1
called	1
Ratcliffe	1
said	1
with	1
gloomy	1
decision--	1
"Of	1
course	1
the	1
President	1
isn't	1
with	1
them.	1
I	1
wish	1
to	1
Gemini	1
he	1
were.	1
Much	1
more	1
likely	1
the	1
President	1
is	1
riding	1
in	1
triumph	1
through	1
Paris,	1
or	1
sitting	1
on	1
the	1
ruins	1
of	1
St.	1
Paul's	1
Cathedral."	1
"This	1
is	1
absurd!"	1
said	1
Syme.	1
"Something	1
may	1
have	1
happened	1
in	1
our	1
absence;	1
but	1
he	1
cannot	1
have	1
carried	1
the	1
world	1
with	1
a	1
rush	1
like	1
that.	1
It	1
is	1
quite	1
true,"	1
he	1
added,	1
frowning	1
dubiously	1
at	1
the	1
distant	1
fields	1
that	1
lay	1
towards	1
the	1
little	1
station,	1
"it	1
is	1
certainly	1
true	1
that	1
there	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
crowd	1
coming	1
this	1
way;	1
but	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
all	1
the	1
army	1
that	1
you	1
make	1
out."	1
"Oh,	1
they,"	1
said	1
the	1
new	1
detective	1
contemptuously;	1
"no	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
a	1
very	1
valuable	1
force.	1
But	1
let	1
me	1
tell	1
you	1
frankly	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
precisely	1
calculated	1
to	1
our	1
value--we	1
are	1
not	1
much,	1
my	1
boy,	1
in	1
Sunday's	1
universe.	1
He	1
has	1
got	1
hold	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
cables	1
and	1
telegraphs	1
himself.	1
But	1
to	1
kill	1
the	1
Supreme	1
Council	1
he	1
regards	1
as	1
a	1
trivial	1
matter,	1
like	1
a	1
post	1
card;	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
left	1
to	1
his	1
private	1
secretary,"	1
and	1
he	1
spat	1
on	1
the	1
grass.	1
Then	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
others	1
and	1
said	1
somewhat	1
austerely--	1
"There	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
to	1
be	1
said	1
for	1
death;	1
but	1
if	1
anyone	1
has	1
any	1
preference	1
for	1
the	1
other	1
alternative,	1
I	1
strongly	1
advise	1
him	1
to	1
walk	1
after	1
me."	1
With	1
these	1
words,	1
he	1
turned	1
his	1
broad	1
back	1
and	1
strode	1
with	1
silent	1
energy	1
towards	1
the	1
wood.	1
The	1
others	1
gave	1
one	1
glance	1
over	1
their	1
shoulders,	1
and	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
dark	1
cloud	1
of	1
men	1
had	1
detached	1
itself	1
from	1
the	1
station	1
and	1
was	1
moving	1
with	1
a	1
mysterious	1
discipline	1
across	1
the	1
plain.	1
They	1
saw	1
already,	1
even	1
with	1
the	1
naked	1
eye,	1
black	1
blots	1
on	1
the	1
foremost	1
faces,	1
which	1
marked	1
the	1
masks	1
they	1
wore.	1
They	1
turned	1
and	1
followed	1
their	1
leader,	1
who	1
had	1
already	1
struck	1
the	1
wood,	1
and	1
disappeared	1
among	1
the	1
twinkling	1
trees.	1
The	1
sun	1
on	1
the	1
grass	1
was	1
dry	1
and	1
hot.	1
So	1
in	1
plunging	1
into	1
the	1
wood	1
they	1
had	1
a	1
cool	1
shock	1
of	1
shadow,	1
as	1
of	1
divers	1
who	1
plunge	1
into	1
a	1
dim	1
pool.	1
The	1
inside	1
of	1
the	1
wood	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
shattered	1
sunlight	1
and	1
shaken	1
shadows.	1
They	1
made	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
shuddering	1
veil,	1
almost	1
recalling	1
the	1
dizziness	1
of	1
a	1
cinematograph.	1
Even	1
the	1
solid	1
figures	1
walking	1
with	1
him	1
Syme	1
could	1
hardly	1
see	1
for	1
the	1
patterns	1
of	1
sun	1
and	1
shade	1
that	1
danced	1
upon	1
them.	1
Now	1
a	1
man's	1
head	1
was	1
lit	1
as	1
with	1
a	1
light	1
of	1
Rembrandt,	1
leaving	1
all	1
else	1
obliterated;	1
now	1
again	1
he	1
had	1
strong	1
and	1
staring	1
white	1
hands	1
with	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
a	1
negro.	1
The	1
ex-Marquis	1
had	1
pulled	1
the	1
old	1
straw	1
hat	1
over	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
the	1
black	1
shade	1
of	1
the	1
brim	1
cut	1
his	1
face	1
so	1
squarely	1
in	1
two	1
that	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
wearing	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
black	1
half-masks	1
of	1
their	1
pursuers.	1
The	1
fancy	1
tinted	1
Syme's	1
overwhelming	1
sense	1
of	1
wonder.	1
Was	1
he	1
wearing	1
a	1
mask?	1
Was	1
anyone	1
wearing	1
a	1
mask?	1
Was	1
anyone	1
anything?	1
This	1
wood	1
of	1
witchery,	1
in	1
which	1
men's	1
faces	1
turned	1
black	1
and	1
white	1
by	1
turns,	1
in	1
which	1
their	1
figures	1
first	1
swelled	1
into	1
sunlight	1
and	1
then	1
faded	1
into	1
formless	1
night,	1
this	1
mere	1
chaos	1
of	1
chiaroscuro	1
(after	1
the	1
clear	1
daylight	1
outside),	1
seemed	1
to	1
Syme	1
a	1
perfect	1
symbol	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
moving	1
for	1
three	1
days,	1
this	1
world	1
where	1
men	1
took	1
off	1
their	1
beards	1
and	1
their	1
spectacles	1
and	1
their	1
noses,	1
and	1
turned	1
into	1
other	1
people.	1
That	1
tragic	1
self-confidence	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
felt	1
when	1
he	1
believed	1
that	1
the	1
Marquis	1
was	1
a	1
devil	1
had	1
strangely	1
disappeared	1
now	1
that	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
Marquis	1
was	1
a	1
friend.	1
He	1
felt	1
almost	1
inclined	1
to	1
ask	1
after	1
all	1
these	1
bewilderments	1
what	1
was	1
a	1
friend	1
and	1
what	1
an	1
enemy.	1
Was	1
there	1
anything	1
that	1
was	1
apart	1
from	1
what	1
it	1
seemed?	1
The	1
Marquis	1
had	1
taken	1
off	1
his	1
nose	1
and	1
turned	1
out	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
detective.	1
Might	1
he	1
not	1
just	1
as	1
well	1
take	1
off	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
turn	1
out	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
hobgoblin?	1
Was	1
not	1
everything,	1
after	1
all,	1
like	1
this	1
bewildering	1
woodland,	1
this	1
dance	1
of	1
dark	1
and	1
light?	1
Everything	1
only	1
a	1
glimpse,	1
the	1
glimpse	1
always	1
unforeseen,	1
and	1
always	1
forgotten.	1
For	1
Gabriel	1
Syme	1
had	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
that	1
sun-splashed	1
wood	1
what	1
many	1
modern	1
painters	1
had	1
found	1
there.	1
He	1
had	1
found	1
the	1
thing	1
which	1
the	1
modern	1
people	1
call	1
Impressionism,	1
which	1
is	1
another	1
name	1
for	1
that	1
final	1
scepticism	1
which	1
can	1
find	1
no	1
floor	1
to	1
the	1
universe.	1
As	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
an	1
evil	1
dream	1
strains	1
himself	1
to	1
scream	1
and	1
wake,	1
Syme	1
strove	1
with	1
a	1
sudden	1
effort	1
to	1
fling	1
off	1
this	1
last	1
and	1
worst	1
of	1
his	1
fancies.	1
With	1
two	1
impatient	1
strides	1
he	1
overtook	1
the	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
Marquis's	1
straw	1
hat,	1
the	1
man	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
address	1
as	1
Ratcliffe.	1
In	1
a	1
voice	1
exaggeratively	1
loud	1
and	1
cheerful,	1
he	1
broke	1
the	1
bottomless	1
silence	1
and	1
made	1
conversation.	1
"May	1
I	1
ask,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"where	1
on	1
earth	1
we	1
are	1
all	1
going	1
to?	1
"	1
So	1
genuine	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
doubts	1
of	1
his	1
soul,	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
quite	1
glad	1
to	1
hear	1
his	1
companion	1
speak	1
in	1
an	1
easy,	1
human	1
voice.	1
"We	1
must	1
get	1
down	1
through	1
the	1
town	1
of	1
Lancy	1
to	1
the	1
sea,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"I	1
think	1
that	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
is	1
least	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
with	1
them."	1
"What	1
can	1
you	1
mean	1
by	1
all	1
this?"	1
cried	1
Syme.	1
"They	1
can't	1
be	1
running	1
the	1
real	1
world	1
in	1
that	1
way.	1
Surely	1
not	1
many	1
working	1
men	1
are	1
anarchists,	1
and	1
surely	1
if	1
they	1
were,	1
mere	1
mobs	1
could	1
not	1
beat	1
modern	1
armies	1
and	1
police."	1
"Mere	1
mobs!"	1
repeated	1
his	1
new	1
friend	1
with	1
a	1
snort	1
of	1
scorn.	1
"So	1
you	1
talk	1
about	1
mobs	1
and	1
the	1
working	1
classes	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
the	1
question.	1
You've	1
got	1
that	1
eternal	1
idiotic	1
idea	1
that	1
if	1
anarchy	1
came	1
it	1
would	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
poor.	1
Why	1
should	1
it?	1
The	1
poor	1
have	1
been	1
rebels,	1
but	1
they	1
have	1
never	1
been	1
anarchists;	1
they	1
have	1
more	1
interest	1
than	1
anyone	1
else	1
in	1
there	1
being	1
some	1
decent	1
government.	1
The	1
poor	1
man	1
really	1
has	1
a	1
stake	1
in	1
the	1
country.	1
The	1
rich	1
man	1
hasn't;	1
he	1
can	1
go	1
away	1
to	1
New	1
Guinea	1
in	1
a	1
yacht.	1
The	1
poor	1
have	1
sometimes	1
objected	1
to	1
being	1
governed	1
badly;	1
the	1
rich	1
have	1
always	1
objected	1
to	1
being	1
governed	1
at	1
all.	1
Aristocrats	1
were	1
always	1
anarchists,	1
as	1
you	1
can	1
see	1
from	1
the	1
barons'	1
wars."	1
"As	1
a	1
lecture	1
on	1
English	1
history	1
for	1
the	1
little	1
ones,"	1
said	1
Syme,	1
"this	1
is	1
all	1
very	1
nice;	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
yet	1
grasped	1
its	1
application."	1
"Its	1
application	1
is,"	1
said	1
his	1
informant,	1
"that	1
most	1
of	1
old	1
Sunday's	1
right-hand	1
men	1
are	1
South	1
African	1
and	1
American	1
millionaires.	1
That	1
is	1
why	1
he	1
has	1
got	1
hold	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
communications;	1
and	1
that	1
is	1
why	1
the	1
last	1
four	1
champions	1
of	1
the	1
anti-anarchist	1
police	1
force	1
are	1
running	1
through	1
a	1
wood	1
like	1
rabbits."	1
"Millionaires	1
I	1
can	1
understand,"	1
said	1
Syme	1
thoughtfully,	1
"they	1
are	1
nearly	1
all	1
mad.	1
But	1
getting	1
hold	1
of	1
a	1
few	1
wicked	1
old	1
gentlemen	1
with	1
hobbies	1
is	1
one	1
thing;	1
getting	1
hold	1
of	1
great	1
Christian	1
nations	1
is	1
another.	1
I	1
would	1
bet	1
the	1
nose	1
off	1
my	1
face	1
(forgive	1
the	1
allusion)	1
that	1
Sunday	1
would	1
stand	1
perfectly	1
helpless	1
before	1
the	1
task	1
of	1
converting	1
any	1
ordinary	1
healthy	1
person	1
anywhere."	1
"Well,"	1
said	1
the	1
other,	1
"it	1
rather	1
depends	1
what	1
sort	1
of	1
person	1
you	1
mean."	1
"Well,	1
for	1
instance,"	1
said	1
Syme,	1
"he	1
could	1
never	1
convert	1
that	1
person,"	1
and	1
he	1
pointed	1
straight	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
him.	1
They	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
an	1
open	1
space	1
of	1
sunlight,	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
express	1
to	1
Syme	1
the	1
final	1
return	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
good	1
sense;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
this	1
forest	1
clearing	1
was	1
a	1
figure	1
that	1
might	1
well	1
stand	1
for	1
that	1
common	1
sense	1
in	1
an	1
almost	1
awful	1
actuality.	1
Burnt	1
by	1
the	1
sun	1
and	1
stained	1
with	1
perspiration,	1
and	1
grave	1
with	1
the	1
bottomless	1
gravity	1
of	1
small	1
necessary	1
toils,	1
a	1
heavy	1
French	1
peasant	1
was	1
cutting	1
wood	1
with	1
a	1
hatchet.	1
His	1
cart	1
stood	1
a	1
few	1
yards	1
off,	1
already	1
half	1
full	1
of	1
timber;	1
and	1
the	1
horse	1
that	1
cropped	1
the	1
grass	1
was,	1
like	1
his	1
master,	1
valorous	1
but	1
not	1
desperate;	1
like	1
his	1
master,	1
he	1
was	1
even	1
prosperous,	1
but	1
yet	1
was	1
almost	1
sad.	1
The	1
man	1
was	1
a	1
Norman,	1
taller	1
than	1
the	1
average	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
and	1
very	1
angular;	1
and	1
his	1
swarthy	1
figure	1
stood	1
dark	1
against	1
a	1
square	1
of	1
sunlight,	1
almost	1
like	1
some	1
allegoric	1
figure	1
of	1
labour	1
frescoed	1
on	1
a	1
ground	1
of	1
gold.	1
"Mr.	1
Syme	1
is	1
saying,"	1
called	1
out	1
Ratcliffe	1
to	1
the	1
French	1
Colonel,	1
"that	1
this	1
man,	1
at	1
least,	1
will	1
never	1
be	1
an	1
anarchist."	1
"Mr.	1
Syme	1
is	1
right	1
enough	1
there,"	1
answered	1
Colonel	1
Ducroix,	1
laughing,	1
"if	1
only	1
for	1
the	1
reason	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
plenty	1
of	1
property	1
to	1
defend.	1
But	1
I	1
forgot	1
that	1
in	1
your	1
country	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
used	1
to	1
peasants	1
being	1
wealthy."	1
"He	1
looks	1
poor,"	1
said	1
Dr.	1
Bull	1
doubtfully.	1
"Quite	1
so,"	1
said	1
the	1
Colonel;	1
"that	1
is	1
why	1
he	1
is	1
rich."	1
"I	1
have	1
an	1
idea,"	1
called	1
out	1
Dr.	1
Bull	1
suddenly;	1
"how	1
much	1
would	1
he	1
take	1
to	1
give	1
us	1
a	1
lift	1
in	1
his	1
cart?	1
Those	1
dogs	1
are	1
all	1
on	1
foot,	1
and	1
we	1
could	1
soon	1
leave	1
them	1
behind."	1
"Oh,	1
give	1
him	1
anything!"	1
said	1
Syme	1
eagerly.	1
"I	1
have	1
piles	1
of	1
money	1
on	1
me."	1
"That	1
will	1
never	1
do,"	1
said	1
the	1
Colonel;	1
"he	1
will	1
never	1
have	1
any	1
respect	1
for	1
you	1
unless	1
you	1
drive	1
a	1
bargain."	1
"Oh,	1
if	1
he	1
haggles!"	1
began	1
Bull	1
impatiently.	1
"Erie	1
haggles	1
because	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
free	1
man,"	1
said	1
the	1
other.	1
"You	1
do	1
not	1
understand;	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
see	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
generosity.	1
He	1
is	1
not	1
being	1
tipped."	1
And	1
even	1
while	1
they	1
seemed	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
heavy	1
feet	1
of	1
their	1
strange	1
pursuers	1
behind	1
them,	1
they	1
had	1
to	1
stand	1
and	1
stamp	1
while	1
the	1
French	1
Colonel	1
talked	1
to	1
the	1
French	1
wood-cutter	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
leisurely	1
badinage	1
and	1
bickering	1
of	1
market-day.	1
At	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
four	1
minutes,	1
however,	1
they	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
Colonel	1
was	1
right,	1
for	1
the	1
wood-cutter	1
entered	1
into	1
their	1
plans,	1
not	1
with	1
the	1
vague	1
servility	1
of	1
a	1
tout	1
too-well	1
paid,	1
but	1
with	1
the	1
seriousness	1
of	1
a	1
solicitor	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
paid	1
the	1
proper	1
fee.	1
He	1
told	1
them	1
that	1
the	1
best	1
thing	1
they	1
could	1
do	1
was	1
to	1
make	1
their	1
way	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
little	1
inn	1
on	1
the	1
hills	1
above	1
Lancy,	1
where	1
the	1
innkeeper,	1
an	1
old	1
soldier	1
who	1
had	1
become	1
devot	1
in	1
his	1
latter	1
years,	1
would	1
be	1
certain	1
to	1
sympathise	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
even	1
to	1
take	1
risks	1
in	1
their	1
support.	1
The	1
whole	1
company,	1
therefore,	1
piled	1
themselves	1
on	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
stacks	1
of	1
wood,	1
and	1
went	1
rocking	1
in	1
the	1
rude	1
cart	1
down	1
the	1
other	1
and	1
steeper	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
woodland.	1
Heavy	1
and	1
ramshackle	1
as	1
was	1
the	1
vehicle,	1
it	1
was	1
driven	1
quickly	1
enough,	1
and	1
they	1
soon	1
had	1
the	1
exhilarating	1
impression	1
of	1
distancing	1
altogether	1
those,	1
whoever	1
they	1
were,	1
who	1
were	1
hunting	1
them.	1
For,	1
after	1
all,	1
the	1
riddle	1
as	1
to	1
where	1
the	1
anarchists	1
had	1
got	1
all	1
these	1
followers	1
was	1
still	1
unsolved.	1
One	1
man's	1
presence	1
had	1
sufficed	1
for	1
them;	1
they	1
had	1
fled	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
deformed	1
smile	1
of	1
the	1
Secretary.	1
Syme	1
every	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
looked	1
back	1
over	1
his	1
shoulder	1
at	1
the	1
army	1
on	1
their	1
track.	1
As	1
the	1
wood	1
grew	1
first	1
thinner	1
and	1
then	1
smaller	1
with	1
distance,	1
he	1
could	1
see	1
the	1
sunlit	1
slopes	1
beyond	1
it	1
and	1
above	1
it;	1
and	1
across	1
these	1
was	1
still	1
moving	1
the	1
square	1
black	1
mob	1
like	1
one	1
monstrous	1
beetle.	1
In	1
the	1
very	1
strong	1
sunlight	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
very	1
strong	1
eyes,	1
which	1
were	1
almost	1
telescopic,	1
Syme	1
could	1
see	1
this	1
mass	1
of	1
men	1
quite	1
plainly.	1
He	1
could	1
see	1
them	1
as	1
separate	1
human	1
figures;	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
increasingly	1
surprised	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
moved	1
as	1
one	1
man.	1
They	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
dressed	1
in	1
dark	1
clothes	1
and	1
plain	1
hats,	1
like	1
any	1
common	1
crowd	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
streets;	1
but	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
spread	1
and	1
sprawl	1
and	1
trail	1
by	1
various	1
lines	1
to	1
the	1
attack,	1
as	1
would	1
be	1
natural	1
in	1
an	1
ordinary	1
mob.	1
They	1
moved	1
with	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
dreadful	1
and	1
wicked	1
woodenness,	1
like	1
a	1
staring	1
army	1
of	1
automatons.	1
Syme	1
pointed	1
this	1
out	1
to	1
Ratcliffe.	1
"Yes,"	1
replied	1
the	1
policeman,	1
"that's	1
discipline.	1
That's	1
Sunday.	1
He	1
is	1
perhaps	1
five	1
hundred	1
miles	1
off,	1
but	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
him	1
is	1
on	1
all	1
of	1
them,	1
like	1
the	1
finger	1
of	1
God.	1
Yes,	1
they	1
are	1
walking	1
regularly;	1
and	1
you	1
bet	1
your	1
boots	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
talking	1
regularly,	1
yes,	1
and	1
thinking	1
regularly.	1
But	1
the	1
one	1
important	1
thing	1
for	1
us	1
is	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
disappearing	1
regularly."	1
Syme	1
nodded.	1
It	1
was	1
true	1
that	1
the	1
black	1
patch	1
of	1
the	1
pursuing	1
men	1
was	1
growing	1
smaller	1
and	1
smaller	1
as	1
the	1
peasant	1
belaboured	1
his	1
horse.	1
The	1
level	1
of	1
the	1
sunlit	1
landscape,	1
though	1
flat	1
as	1
a	1
whole,	1
fell	1
away	1
on	1
the	1
farther	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
wood	1
in	1
billows	1
of	1
heavy	1
slope	1
towards	1
the	1
sea,	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
not	1
unlike	1
the	1
lower	1
slopes	1
of	1
the	1
Sussex	1
downs.	1
The	1
only	1
difference	1
was	1
that	1
in	1
Sussex	1
the	1
road	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
broken	1
and	1
angular	1
like	1
a	1
little	1
brook,	1
but	1
here	1
the	1
white	1
French	1
road	1
fell	1
sheer	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
them	1
like	1
a	1
waterfall.	1
Down	1
this	1
direct	1
descent	1
the	1
cart	1
clattered	1
at	1
a	1
considerable	1
angle,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
minutes,	1
the	1
road	1
growing	1
yet	1
steeper,	1
they	1
saw	1
below	1
them	1
the	1
little	1
harbour	1
of	1
Lancy	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
blue	1
arc	1
of	1
the	1
sea.	1
The	1
travelling	1
cloud	1
of	1
their	1
enemies	1
had	1
wholly	1
disappeared	1
from	1
the	1
horizon.	1
The	1
horse	1
and	1
cart	1
took	1
a	1
sharp	1
turn	1
round	1
a	1
clump	1
of	1
elms,	1
and	1
the	1
horse's	1
nose	1
nearly	1
struck	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
an	1
old	1
gentleman	1
who	1
was	1
sitting	1
on	1
the	1
benches	1
outside	1
the	1
little	1
cafe	1
of	1
"Le	1
Soleil	1
d'Or."	1
The	1
peasant	1
grunted	1
an	1
apology,	1
and	1
got	1
down	1
from	1
his	1
seat.	1
The	1
others	1
also	1
descended	1
one	1
by	1
one,	1
and	1
spoke	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
gentleman	1
with	1
fragmentary	1
phrases	1
of	1
courtesy,	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
quite	1
evident	1
from	1
his	1
expansive	1
manner	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
owner	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
tavern.	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
white-haired,	1
apple-faced	1
old	1
boy,	1
with	1
sleepy	1
eyes	1
and	1
a	1
grey	1
moustache;	1
stout,	1
sedentary,	1
and	1
very	1
innocent,	1
of	1
a	1
type	1
that	1
may	1
often	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
France,	1
but	1
is	1
still	1
commoner	1
in	1
Catholic	1
Germany.	1
Everything	1
about	1
him,	1
his	1
pipe,	1
his	1
pot	1
of	1
beer,	1
his	1
flowers,	1
and	1
his	1
beehive,	1
suggested	1
an	1
ancestral	1
peace;	1
only	1
when	1
his	1
visitors	1
looked	1
up	1
as	1
they	1
entered	1
the	1
inn-parlour,	1
they	1
saw	1
the	1
sword	1
upon	1
the	1
wall.	1
The	1
Colonel,	1
who	1
greeted	1
the	1
innkeeper	1
as	1
an	1
old	1
friend,	1
passed	1
rapidly	1
into	1
the	1
inn-parlour,	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
ordering	1
some	1
ritual	1
refreshment.	1
The	1
military	1
decision	1
of	1
his	1
action	1
interested	1
Syme,	1
who	1
sat	1
next	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
opportunity	1
when	1
the	1
old	1
innkeeper	1
had	1
gone	1
out	1
of	1
satisfying	1
his	1
curiosity.	1
"May	1
I	1
ask	1
you,	1
Colonel,"	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice,	1
"why	1
we	1
have	1
come	1
here?"	1
Colonel	1
Ducroix	1
smiled	1
behind	1
his	1
bristly	1
white	1
moustache.	1
"For	1
two	1
reasons,	1
sir,"	1
he	1
said;	1
"and	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
first,	1
not	1
the	1
most	1
important,	1
but	1
the	1
most	1
utilitarian.	1
We	1
came	1
here	1
because	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
only	1
place	1
within	1
twenty	1
miles	1
in	1
which	1
we	1
can	1
get	1
horses."	1
"Horses!"	1
repeated	1
Syme,	1
looking	1
up	1
quickly.	1
"Yes,"	1
replied	1
the	1
other;	1
"if	1
you	1
people	1
are	1
really	1
to	1
distance	1
your	1
enemies	1
it	1
is	1
horses	1
or	1
nothing	1
for	1
you,	1
unless	1
of	1
course	1
you	1
have	1
bicycles	1
and	1
motor-cars	1
in	1
your	1
pocket."	1
"And	1
where	1
do	1
you	1
advise	1
us	1
to	1
make	1
for?"	1
asked	1
Syme	1
doubtfully.	1
"Beyond	1
question,"	1
replied	1
the	1
Colonel,	1
"you	1
had	1
better	1
make	1
all	1
haste	1
to	1
the	1
police	1
station	1
beyond	1
the	1
town.	1
My	1
friend,	1
whom	1
I	1
seconded	1
under	1
somewhat	1
deceptive	1
circumstances,	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
exaggerate	1
very	1
much	1
the	1
possibilities	1
of	1
a	1
general	1
rising;	1
but	1
even	1
he	1
would	1
hardly	1
maintain,	1
I	1
suppose,	1
that	1
you	1
were	1
not	1
safe	1
with	1
the	1
gendarmes."	1
Syme	1
nodded	1
gravely;	1
then	1
he	1
said	1
abruptly--	1
"And	1
your	1
other	1
reason	1
for	1
coming	1
here?"	1
"My	1
other	1
reason	1
for	1
coming	1
here,"	1
said	1
Ducroix	1
soberly,	1
"is	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
just	1
as	1
well	1
to	1
see	1
a	1
good	1
man	1
or	1
two	1
when	1
one	1
is	1
possibly	1
near	1
to	1
death."	1
Syme	1
looked	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
wall,	1
and	1
saw	1
a	1
crudely-painted	1
and	1
pathetic	1
religious	1
picture.	1
Then	1
he	1
said--	1
"You	1
are	1
right,"	1
and	1
then	1
almost	1
immediately	1
afterwards,	1
"Has	1
anyone	1
seen	1
about	1
the	1
horses?"	1
"Yes,"	1
answered	1
Ducroix,	1
"you	1
may	1
be	1
quite	1
certain	1
that	1
I	1
gave	1
orders	1
the	1
moment	1
I	1
came	1
in.	1
Those	1
enemies	1
of	1
yours	1
gave	1
no	1
impression	1
of	1
hurry,	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
really	1
moving	1
wonderfully	1
fast,	1
like	1
a	1
well-trained	1
army.	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
idea	1
that	1
the	1
anarchists	1
had	1
so	1
much	1
discipline.	1
You	1
have	1
not	1
a	1
moment	1
to	1
waste."	1
Almost	1
as	1
he	1
spoke,	1
the	1
old	1
innkeeper	1
with	1
the	1
blue	1
eyes	1
and	1
white	1
hair	1
came	1
ambling	1
into	1
the	1
room,	1
and	1
announced	1
that	1
six	1
horses	1
were	1
saddled	1
outside.	1
By	1
Ducroix's	1
advice	1
the	1
five	1
others	1
equipped	1
themselves	1
with	1
some	1
portable	1
form	1
of	1
food	1
and	1
wine,	1
and	1
keeping	1
their	1
duelling	1
swords	1
as	1
the	1
only	1
weapons	1
available,	1
they	1
clattered	1
away	1
down	1
the	1
steep,	1
white	1
road.	1
The	1
two	1
servants,	1
who	1
had	1
carried	1
the	1
Marquis's	1
luggage	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
marquis,	1
were	1
left	1
behind	1
to	1
drink	1
at	1
the	1
cafe	1
by	1
common	1
consent,	1
and	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
against	1
their	1
own	1
inclination.	1
By	1
this	1
time	1
the	1
afternoon	1
sun	1
was	1
slanting	1
westward,	1
and	1
by	1
its	1
rays	1
Syme	1
could	1
see	1
the	1
sturdy	1
figure	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
innkeeper	1
growing	1
smaller	1
and	1
smaller,	1
but	1
still	1
standing	1
and	1
looking	1
after	1
them	1
quite	1
silently,	1
the	1
sunshine	1
in	1
his	1
silver	1
hair.	1
Syme	1
had	1
a	1
fixed,	1
superstitious	1
fancy,	1
left	1
in	1
his	1
mind	1
by	1
the	1
chance	1
phrase	1
of	1
the	1
Colonel,	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
indeed,	1
perhaps,	1
the	1
last	1
honest	1
stranger	1
whom	1
he	1
should	1
ever	1
see	1
upon	1
the	1
earth.	1
He	1
was	1
still	1
looking	1
at	1
this	1
dwindling	1
figure,	1
which	1
stood	1
as	1
a	1
mere	1
grey	1
blot	1
touched	1
with	1
a	1
white	1
flame	1
against	1
the	1
great	1
green	1
wall	1
of	1
the	1
steep	1
down	1
behind	1
him.	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
stared	1
over	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
down	1
behind	1
the	1
innkeeper,	1
there	1
appeared	1
an	1
army	1
of	1
black-clad	1
and	1
marching	1
men.	1
They	1
seemed	1
to	1
hang	1
above	1
the	1
good	1
man	1
and	1
his	1
house	1
like	1
a	1
black	1
cloud	1
of	1
locusts.	1
The	1
horses	1
had	1
been	1
saddled	1
none	1
too	1
soon.	1
CHAPTER	1
XII	1
THE	1
EARTH	1
IN	1
ANARCHY	1
URGING	1
the	1
horses	1
to	1
a	1
gallop,	1
without	1
respect	1
to	1
the	1
rather	1
rugged	1
descent	1
of	1
the	1
road,	1
the	1
horsemen	1
soon	1
regained	1
their	1
advantage	1
over	1
the	1
men	1
on	1
the	1
march,	1
and	1
at	1
last	1
the	1
bulk	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
buildings	1
of	1
Lancy	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
their	1
pursuers.	1
Nevertheless,	1
the	1
ride	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
long	1
one,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
time	1
they	1
reached	1
the	1
real	1
town	1
the	1
west	1
was	1
warming	1
with	1
the	1
colour	1
and	1
quality	1
of	1
sunset.	1
The	1
Colonel	1
suggested	1
that,	1
before	1
making	1
finally	1
for	1
the	1
police	1
station,	1
they	1
should	1
make	1
the	1
effort,	1
in	1
passing,	1
to	1
attach	1
to	1
themselves	1
one	1
more	1
individual	1
who	1
might	1
be	1
useful.	1
"Four	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
five	1
rich	1
men	1
in	1
this	1
town,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"are	1
common	1
swindlers.	1
I	1
suppose	1
the	1
proportion	1
is	1
pretty	1
equal	1
all	1
over	1
the	1
world.	1
The	1
fifth	1
is	1
a	1
friend	1
of	1
mine,	1
and	1
a	1
very	1
fine	1
fellow;	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
even	1
more	1
important	1
from	1
our	1
point	1
of	1
view,	1
he	1
owns	1
a	1
motor-car."	1
"I	1
am	1
afraid,"	1
said	1
the	1
Professor	1
in	1
his	1
mirthful	1
way,	1
looking	1
back	1
along	1
the	1
white	1
road	1
on	1
which	1
the	1
black,	1
crawling	1
patch	1
might	1
appear	1
at	1
any	1
moment,	1
"I	1
am	1
afraid	1
we	1
have	1
hardly	1
time	1
for	1
afternoon	1
calls."	1
"Doctor	1
Renard's	1
house	1
is	1
only	1
three	1
minutes	1
off,"	1
said	1
the	1
Colonel.	1
"Our	1
danger,"	1
said	1
Dr.	1
Bull,	1
"is	1
not	1
two	1
minutes	1
off."	1
"Yes,"	1
said	1
Syme,	1
"if	1
we	1
ride	1
on	1
fast	1
we	1
must	1
leave	1
them	1
behind,	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
on	1
foot."	1
"He	1
has	1
a	1
motor-car,"	1
said	1
the	1
Colonel.	1
"But	1
we	1
may	1
not	1
get	1
it,"	1
said	1
Bull.	1
"Yes,	1
he	1
is	1
quite	1
on	1
your	1
side."	1
"But	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
out."	1
"Hold	1
your	1
tongue,"	1
said	1
Syme	1
suddenly.	1
"What	1
is	1
that	1
noise?"	1
For	1
a	1
second	1
they	1
all	1
sat	1
as	1
still	1
as	1
equestrian	1
statues,	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
second--for	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
or	1
four	1
seconds--heaven	1
and	1
earth	1
seemed	1
equally	1
still.	1
Then	1
all	1
their	1
ears,	1
in	1
an	1
agony	1
of	1
attention,	1
heard	1
along	1
the	1
road	1
that	1
indescribable	1
thrill	1
and	1
throb	1
that	1
means	1
only	1
one	1
thing--horses!	1
The	1
Colonel's	1
face	1
had	1
an	1
instantaneous	1
change,	1
as	1
if	1
lightning	1
had	1
struck	1
it,	1
and	1
yet	1
left	1
it	1
scatheless.	1
"They	1
have	1
done	1
us,"	1
he	1
said,	1
with	1
brief	1
military	1
irony.	1
"Prepare	1
to	1
receive	1
cavalry!"	1
"Where	1
can	1
they	1
have	1
got	1
the	1
horses?"	1
asked	1
Syme,	1
as	1
he	1
mechanically	1
urged	1
his	1
steed	1
to	1
a	1
canter.	1
The	1
Colonel	1
was	1
silent	1
for	1
a	1
little,	1
then	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
strained	1
voice--	1
"I	1
was	1
speaking	1
with	1
strict	1
accuracy	1
when	1
I	1
said	1
that	1
the	1
'Soleil	1
d'Or'	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
place	1
where	1
one	1
can	1
get	1
horses	1
within	1
twenty	1
miles."	1
"No!"	1
said	1
Syme	1
violently,	1
"I	1
don't	1
believe	1
he'd	1
do	1
it.	1
Not	1
with	1
all	1
that	1
white	1
hair."	1
"He	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
forced,"	1
said	1
the	1
Colonel	1
gently.	1
"They	1
must	1
be	1
at	1
least	1
a	1
hundred	1
strong,	1
for	1
which	1
reason	1
we	1
are	1
all	1
going	1
to	1
see	1
my	1
friend	1
Renard,	1
who	1
has	1
a	1
motor-car."	1
With	1
these	1
words	1
he	1
swung	1
his	1
horse	1
suddenly	1
round	1
a	1
street	1
corner,	1
and	1
went	1
down	1
the	1
street	1
with	1
such	1
thundering	1
speed,	1
that	1
the	1
others,	1
though	1
already	1
well	1
at	1
the	1
gallop,	1
had	1
difficulty	1
in	1
following	1
the	1
flying	1
tail	1
of	1
his	1
horse.	1
Dr.	1
Renard	1
inhabited	1
a	1
high	1
and	1
comfortable	1
house	1
at	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
a	1
steep	1
street,	1
so	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
riders	1
alighted	1
at	1
his	1
door	1
they	1
could	1
once	1
more	1
see	1
the	1
solid	1
green	1
ridge	1
of	1
the	1
hill,	1
with	1
the	1
white	1
road	1
across	1
it,	1
standing	1
up	1
above	1
all	1
the	1
roofs	1
of	1
the	1
town.	1
They	1
breathed	1
again	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
the	1
road	1
as	1
yet	1
was	1
clear,	1
and	1
they	1
rang	1
the	1
bell.	1
Dr.	1
Renard	1
was	1
a	1
beaming,	1
brown-bearded	1
man,	1
a	1
good	1
example	1
of	1
that	1
silent	1
but	1
very	1
busy	1
professional	1
class	1
which	1
France	1
has	1
preserved	1
even	1
more	1
perfectly	1
than	1
England.	1
When	1
the	1
matter	1
was	1
explained	1
to	1
him	1
he	1
pooh-poohed	1
the	1
panic	1
of	1
the	1
ex-Marquis	1
altogether;	1
he	1
said,	1
with	1
the	1
solid	1
French	1
scepticism,	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
conceivable	1
probability	1
of	1
a	1
general	1
anarchist	1
rising.	1
"Anarchy,"	1
he	1
said,	1
shrugging	1
his	1
shoulders,	1
"it	1
is	1
childishness!"	1
"Et	1
ca,"	1
cried	1
out	1
the	1
Colonel	1
suddenly,	1
pointing	1
over	1
the	1
other's	1
shoulder,	1
"and	1
that	1
is	1
childishness,	1
isn't	1
it?"	1
They	1
all	1
looked	1
round,	1
and	1
saw	1
a	1
curve	1
of	1
black	1
cavalry	1
come	1
sweeping	1
over	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
hill	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
energy	1
of	1
Attila.	1
Swiftly	1
as	1
they	1
rode,	1
however,	1
the	1
whole	1
rank	1
still	1
kept	1
well	1
together,	1
and	1
they	1
could	1
see	1
the	1
black	1
vizards	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
line	1
as	1
level	1
as	1
a	1
line	1
of	1
uniforms.	1
But	1
although	1
the	1
main	1
black	1
square	1
was	1
the	1
same,	1
though	1
travelling	1
faster,	1
there	1
was	1
now	1
one	1
sensational	1
difference	1
which	1
they	1
could	1
see	1
clearly	1
upon	1
the	1
slope	1
of	1
the	1
hill,	1
as	1
if	1
upon	1
a	1
slanted	1
map.	1
The	1
bulk	1
of	1
the	1
riders	1
were	1
in	1
one	1
block;	1
but	1
one	1
rider	1
flew	1
far	1
ahead	1
of	1
the	1
column,	1
and	1
with	1
frantic	1
movements	1
of	1
hand	1
and	1
heel	1
urged	1
his	1
horse	1
faster	1
and	1
faster,	1
so	1
that	1
one	1
might	1
have	1
fancied	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
pursuer	1
but	1
the	1
pursued.	1
But	1
even	1
at	1
that	1
great	1
distance	1
they	1
could	1
see	1
something	1
so	1
fanatical,	1
so	1
unquestionable	1
in	1
his	1
figure,	1
that	1
they	1
knew	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
Secretary	1
himself.	1
"I	1
am	1
sorry	1
to	1
cut	1
short	1
a	1
cultured	1
discussion,"	1
said	1
the	1
Colonel,	1
"but	1
can	1
you	1
lend	1
me	1
your	1
motor-car	1
now,	1
in	1
two	1
minutes?"	1
"I	1
have	1
a	1
suspicion	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
all	1
mad,"	1
said	1
Dr.	1
Renard,	1
smiling	1
sociably;	1
"but	1
God	1
forbid	1
that	1
madness	1
should	1
in	1
any	1
way	1
interrupt	1
friendship.	1
Let	1
us	1
go	1
round	1
to	1
the	1
garage."	1
Dr.	1
Renard	1
was	1
a	1
mild	1
man	1
with	1
monstrous	1
wealth;	1
his	1
rooms	1
were	1
like	1
the	1
Musee	1
de	1
Cluny,	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
three	1
motor-cars.	1
These,	1
however,	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
use	1
very	1
sparingly,	1
having	1
the	1
simple	1
tastes	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
middle	1
class,	1
and	1
when	1
his	1
impatient	1
friends	1
came	1
to	1
examine	1
them,	1
it	1
took	1
them	1
some	1
time	1
to	1
assure	1
themselves	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
even	1
could	1
be	1
made	1
to	1
work.	1
This	1
with	1
some	1
difficulty	1
they	1
brought	1
round	1
into	1
the	1
street	1
before	1
the	1
Doctor's	1
house.	1
When	1
they	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
dim	1
garage	1
they	1
were	1
startled	1
to	1
find	1
that	1
twilight	1
had	1
already	1
fallen	1
with	1
the	1
abruptness	1
of	1
night	1
in	1
the	1
tropics.	1
Either	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
longer	1
in	1
the	1
place	1
than	1
they	1
imagined,	1
or	1
some	1
unusual	1
canopy	1
of	1
cloud	1
had	1
gathered	1
over	1
the	1
town.	1
They	1
looked	1
down	1
the	1
steep	1
streets,	1
and	1
seemed	1
to	1
see	1
a	1
slight	1
mist	1
coming	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
sea.	1
"It	1
is	1
now	1
or	1
never,"	1
said	1
Dr.	1
Bull.	1
"I	1
hear	1
horses."	1
"No,"	1
corrected	1
the	1
Professor,	1
"a	1
horse."	1
And	1
as	1
they	1
listened,	1
it	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
the	1
noise,	1
rapidly	1
coming	1
nearer	1
on	1
the	1
rattling	1
stones,	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
cavalcade	1
but	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
one	1
horseman,	1
who	1
had	1
left	1
it	1
far	1
behind--the	1
insane	1
Secretary.	1
Syme's	1
family,	1
like	1
most	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
end	1
in	1
the	1
simple	1
life,	1
had	1
once	1
owned	1
a	1
motor,	1
and	1
he	1
knew	1
all	1
about	1
them.	1
He	1
had	1
leapt	1
at	1
once	1
into	1
the	1
chauffeur's	1
seat,	1
and	1
with	1
flushed	1
face	1
was	1
wrenching	1
and	1
tugging	1
at	1
the	1
disused	1
machinery.	1
He	1
bent	1
his	1
strength	1
upon	1
one	1
handle,	1
and	1
then	1
said	1
quite	1
quietly--	1
"I	1
am	1
afraid	1
it's	1
no	1
go."	1
As	1
he	1
spoke,	1
there	1
swept	1
round	1
the	1
corner	1
a	1
man	1
rigid	1
on	1
his	1
rushing	1
horse,	1
with	1
the	1
rush	1
and	1
rigidity	1
of	1
an	1
arrow.	1
He	1
had	1
a	1
smile	1
that	1
thrust	1
out	1
his	1
chin	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
dislocated.	1
He	1
swept	1
alongside	1
of	1
the	1
stationary	1
car,	1
into	1
which	1
its	1
company	1
had	1
crowded,	1
and	1
laid	1
his	1
hand	1
on	1
the	1
front.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
Secretary,	1
and	1
his	1
mouth	1
went	1
quite	1
straight	1
in	1
the	1
solemnity	1
of	1
triumph.	1
Syme	1
was	1
leaning	1
hard	1
upon	1
the	1
steering	1
wheel,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
sound	1
but	1
the	1
rumble	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
pursuers	1
riding	1
into	1
the	1
town.	1
Then	1
there	1
came	1
quite	1
suddenly	1
a	1
scream	1
of	1
scraping	1
iron,	1
and	1
the	1
car	1
leapt	1
forward.	1
It	1
plucked	1
the	1
Secretary	1
clean	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
saddle,	1
as	1
a	1
knife	1
is	1
whipped	1
out	1
of	1
its	1
sheath,	1
trailed	1
him	1
kicking	1
terribly	1
for	1
twenty	1
yards,	1
and	1
left	1
him	1
flung	1
flat	1
upon	1
the	1
road	1
far	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
his	1
frightened	1
horse.	1
As	1
the	1
car	1
took	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
street	1
with	1
a	1
splendid	1
curve,	1
they	1
could	1
just	1
see	1
the	1
other	1
anarchists	1
filling	1
the	1
street	1
and	1
raising	1
their	1
fallen	1
leader.	1
"I	1
can't	1
understand	1
why	1
it	1
has	1
grown	1
so	1
dark,"	1
said	1
the	1
Professor	1
at	1
last	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice.	1
"Going	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
storm,	1
I	1
think,"	1
said	1
Dr.	1
Bull.	1
"I	1
say,	1
it's	1
a	1
pity	1
we	1
haven't	1
got	1
a	1
light	1
on	1
this	1
car,	1
if	1
only	1
to	1
see	1
by."	1
"We	1
have,"	1
said	1
the	1
Colonel,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
floor	1
of	1
the	1
car	1
he	1
fished	1
up	1
a	1
heavy,	1
old-fashioned,	1
carved	1
iron	1
lantern	1
with	1
a	1
light	1
inside	1
it.	1
It	1
was	1
obviously	1
an	1
antique,	1
and	1
it	1
would	1
seem	1
as	1
if	1
its	1
original	1
use	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
some	1
way	1
semi-religious,	1
for	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
rude	1
moulding	1
of	1
a	1
cross	1
upon	1
one	1
of	1
its	1
sides.	1
"Where	1
on	1
earth	1
did	1
you	1
get	1
that?"	1
asked	1
the	1
Professor.	1
"I	1
got	1
it	1
where	1
I	1
got	1
the	1
car,"	1
answered	1
the	1
Colonel,	1
chuckling,	1
"from	1
my	1
best	1
friend.	1
While	1
our	1
friend	1
here	1
was	1
fighting	1
with	1
the	1
steering	1
wheel,	1
I	1
ran	1
up	1
the	1
front	1
steps	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
spoke	1
to	1
Renard,	1
who	1
was	1
standing	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
porch,	1
you	1
will	1
remember.	1
'I	1
suppose,'	1
I	1
said,	1
'there's	1
no	1
time	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
lamp.'	1
He	1
looked	1
up,	1
blinking	1
amiably	1
at	1
the	1
beautiful	1
arched	1
ceiling	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
front	1
hall.	1
From	1
this	1
was	1
suspended,	1
by	1
chains	1
of	1
exquisite	1
ironwork,	1
this	1
lantern,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
hundred	1
treasures	1
of	1
his	1
treasure	1
house.	1
By	1
sheer	1
force	1
he	1
tore	1
the	1
lamp	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
ceiling,	1
shattering	1
the	1
painted	1
panels,	1
and	1
bringing	1
down	1
two	1
blue	1
vases	1
with	1
his	1
violence.	1
Then	1
he	1
handed	1
me	1
the	1
iron	1
lantern,	1
and	1
I	1
put	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
car.	1
Was	1
I	1
not	1
right	1
when	1
I	1
said	1
that	1
Dr.	1
Renard	1
was	1
worth	1
knowing?"	1
"You	1
were,"	1
said	1
Syme	1
seriously,	1
and	1
hung	1
the	1
heavy	1
lantern	1
over	1
the	1
front.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
certain	1
allegory	1
of	1
their	1
whole	1
position	1
in	1
the	1
contrast	1
between	1
the	1
modern	1
automobile	1
and	1
its	1
strange	1
ecclesiastical	1
lamp.	1
Hitherto	1
they	1
had	1
passed	1
through	1
the	1
quietest	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
town,	1
meeting	1
at	1
most	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
pedestrians,	1
who	1
could	1
give	1
them	1
no	1
hint	1
of	1
the	1
peace	1
or	1
the	1
hostility	1
of	1
the	1
place.	1
Now,	1
however,	1
the	1
windows	1
in	1
the	1
houses	1
began	1
one	1
by	1
one	1
to	1
be	1
lit	1
up,	1
giving	1
a	1
greater	1
sense	1
of	1
habitation	1
and	1
humanity.	1
Dr.	1
Bull	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
new	1
detective	1
who	1
had	1
led	1
their	1
flight,	1
and	1
permitted	1
himself	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
natural	1
and	1
friendly	1
smiles.	1
"These	1
lights	1
make	1
one	1
feel	1
more	1
cheerful."	1
Inspector	1
Ratcliffe	1
drew	1
his	1
brows	1
together.	1
"There	1
is	1
only	1
one	1
set	1
of	1
lights	1
that	1
make	1
me	1
more	1
cheerful,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"and	1
they	1
are	1
those	1
lights	1
of	1
the	1
police	1
station	1
which	1
I	1
can	1
see	1
beyond	1
the	1
town.	1
Please	1
God	1
we	1
may	1
be	1
there	1
in	1
ten	1
minutes."	1
Then	1
all	1
Bull's	1
boiling	1
good	1
sense	1
and	1
optimism	1
broke	1
suddenly	1
out	1
of	1
him.	1
"Oh,	1
this	1
is	1
all	1
raving	1
nonsense!"	1
he	1
cried.	1
"If	1
you	1
really	1
think	1
that	1
ordinary	1
people	1
in	1
ordinary	1
houses	1
are	1
anarchists,	1
you	1
must	1
be	1
madder	1
than	1
an	1
anarchist	1
yourself.	1
If	1
we	1
turned	1
and	1
fought	1
these	1
fellows,	1
the	1
whole	1
town	1
would	1
fight	1
for	1
us."	1
"No,"	1
said	1
the	1
other	1
with	1
an	1
immovable	1
simplicity,	1
"the	1
whole	1
town	1
would	1
fight	1
for	1
them.	1
We	1
shall	1
see.'	1
While	1
they	1
were	1
speaking	1
the	1
Professor	1
had	1
leant	1
forward	1
with	1
sudden	1
excitement.	1
"What	1
is	1
that	1
noise?"	1
he	1
said.	1
"Oh,	1
the	1
horses	1
behind	1
us,	1
I	1
suppose,"	1
said	1
the	1
Colonel.	1
"I	1
thought	1
we	1
had	1
got	1
clear	1
of	1
them."	1
"The	1
horses	1
behind	1
us!	1
No,"	1
said	1
the	1
Professor,	1
"it	1
is	1
not	1
horses,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
behind	1
us."	1
Almost	1
as	1
he	1
spoke,	1
across	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
street	1
before	1
them	1
two	1
shining	1
and	1
rattling	1
shapes	1
shot	1
past.	1
They	1
were	1
gone	1
almost	1
in	1
a	1
flash,	1
but	1
everyone	1
could	1
see	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
motor-cars,	1
and	1
the	1
Professor	1
stood	1
up	1
with	1
a	1
pale	1
face	1
and	1
swore	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
the	1
other	1
two	1
motor-cars	1
from	1
Dr.	1
Renard's	1
garage.	1
"I	1
tell	1
you	1
they	1
were	1
his,"	1
he	1
repeated,	1
with	1
wild	1
eyes,	1
"and	1
they	1
were	1
full	1
of	1
men	1
in	1
masks!"	1
"Absurd!"	1
said	1
the	1
Colonel	1
angrily.	1
"Dr.	1
Renard	1
would	1
never	1
give	1
them	1
his	1
cars."	1
"He	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
forced,"	1
said	1
Ratcliffe	1
quietly.	1
"The	1
whole	1
town	1
is	1
on	1
their	1
side."	1
"You	1
still	1
believe	1
that,"	1
asked	1
the	1
Colonel	1
incredulously.	1
"You	1
will	1
all	1
believe	1
it	1
soon,"	1
said	1
the	1
other	1
with	1
a	1
hopeless	1
calm.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
puzzled	1
pause	1
for	1
some	1
little	1
time,	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
Colonel	1
began	1
again	1
abruptly--	1
"No,	1
I	1
can't	1
believe	1
it.	1
The	1
thing	1
is	1
nonsense.	1
The	1
plain	1
people	1
of	1
a	1
peaceable	1
French	1
town--"	1
He	1
was	1
cut	1
short	1
by	1
a	1
bang	1
and	1
a	1
blaze	1
of	1
light,	1
which	1
seemed	1
close	1
to	1
his	1
eyes.	1
As	1
the	1
car	1
sped	1
on	1
it	1
left	1
a	1
floating	1
patch	1
of	1
white	1
smoke	1
behind	1
it,	1
and	1
Syme	1
had	1
heard	1
a	1
shot	1
shriek	1
past	1
his	1
ear.	1
"My	1
God!"	1
said	1
the	1
Colonel,	1
"someone	1
has	1
shot	1
at	1
us."	1
"It	1
need	1
not	1
interrupt	1
conversation,"	1
said	1
the	1
gloomy	1
Ratcliffe.	1
"Pray	1
resume	1
your	1
remarks,	1
Colonel.	1
You	1
were	1
talking,	1
I	1
think,	1
about	1
the	1
plain	1
people	1
of	1
a	1
peaceable	1
French	1
town."	1
The	1
staring	1
Colonel	1
was	1
long	1
past	1
minding	1
satire.	1
He	1
rolled	1
his	1
eyes	1
all	1
round	1
the	1
street.	1
"It	1
is	1
extraordinary,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"most	1
extraordinary."	1
"A	1
fastidious	1
person,"	1
said	1
Syme,	1
"might	1
even	1
call	1
it	1
unpleasant.	1
However,	1
I	1
suppose	1
those	1
lights	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
field	1
beyond	1
this	1
street	1
are	1
the	1
Gendarmerie.	1
We	1
shall	1
soon	1
get	1
there."	1
"No,"	1
said	1
Inspector	1
Ratcliffe,	1
"we	1
shall	1
never	1
get	1
there."	1
He	1
had	1
been	1
standing	1
up	1
and	1
looking	1
keenly	1
ahead	1
of	1
him.	1
Now	1
he	1
sat	1
down	1
and	1
smoothed	1
his	1
sleek	1
hair	1
with	1
a	1
weary	1
gesture.	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
mean?"	1
asked	1
Bull	1
sharply.	1
"I	1
mean	1
that	1
we	1
shall	1
never	1
get	1
there,"	1
said	1
the	1
pessimist	1
placidly.	1
"They	1
have	1
two	1
rows	1
of	1
armed	1
men	1
across	1
the	1
road	1
already;	1
I	1
can	1
see	1
them	1
from	1
here.	1
The	1
town	1
is	1
in	1
arms,	1
as	1
I	1
said	1
it	1
was.	1
I	1
can	1
only	1
wallow	1
in	1
the	1
exquisite	1
comfort	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
exactitude."	1
And	1
Ratcliffe	1
sat	1
down	1
comfortably	1
in	1
the	1
car	1
and	1
lit	1
a	1
cigarette,	1
but	1
the	1
others	1
rose	1
excitedly	1
and	1
stared	1
down	1
the	1
road.	1
Syme	1
had	1
slowed	1
down	1
the	1
car	1
as	1
their	1
plans	1
became	1
doubtful,	1
and	1
he	1
brought	1
it	1
finally	1
to	1
a	1
standstill	1
just	1
at	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
a	1
side	1
street	1
that	1
ran	1
down	1
very	1
steeply	1
to	1
the	1
sea.	1
The	1
town	1
was	1
mostly	1
in	1
shadow,	1
but	1
the	1
sun	1
had	1
not	1
sunk;	1
wherever	1
its	1
level	1
light	1
could	1
break	1
through,	1
it	1
painted	1
everything	1
a	1
burning	1
gold.	1
Up	1
this	1
side	1
street	1
the	1
last	1
sunset	1
light	1
shone	1
as	1
sharp	1
and	1
narrow	1
as	1
the	1
shaft	1
of	1
artificial	1
light	1
at	1
the	1
theatre.	1
It	1
struck	1
the	1
car	1
of	1
the	1
five	1
friends,	1
and	1
lit	1
it	1
like	1
a	1
burning	1
chariot.	1
But	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
street,	1
especially	1
the	1
two	1
ends	1
of	1
it,	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
deepest	1
twilight,	1
and	1
for	1
some	1
seconds	1
they	1
could	1
see	1
nothing.	1
Then	1
Syme,	1
whose	1
eyes	1
were	1
the	1
keenest,	1
broke	1
into	1
a	1
little	1
bitter	1
whistle,	1
and	1
said	1
"It	1
is	1
quite	1
true.	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
crowd	1
or	1
an	1
army	1
or	1
some	1
such	1
thing	1
across	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
that	1
street."	1
"Well,	1
if	1
there	1
is,"	1
said	1
Bull	1
impatiently,	1
"it	1
must	1
be	1
something	1
else--a	1
sham	1
fight	1
or	1
the	1
mayor's	1
birthday	1
or	1
something.	1
I	1
cannot	1
and	1
will	1
not	1
believe	1
that	1
plain,	1
jolly	1
people	1
in	1
a	1
place	1
like	1
this	1
walk	1
about	1
with	1
dynamite	1
in	1
their	1
pockets.	1
Get	1
on	1
a	1
bit,	1
Syme,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
look	1
at	1
them."	1
The	1
car	1
crawled	1
about	1
a	1
hundred	1
yards	1
farther,	1
and	1
then	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
startled	1
by	1
Dr.	1
Bull	1
breaking	1
into	1
a	1
high	1
crow	1
of	1
laughter.	1
"Why,	1
you	1
silly	1
mugs!"	1
he	1
cried,	1
"what	1
did	1
I	1
tell	1
you.	1
That	1
crowd's	1
as	1
law-abiding	1
as	1
a	1
cow,	1
and	1
if	1
it	1
weren't,	1
it's	1
on	1
our	1
side."	1
"How	1
do	1
you	1
know?"	1
asked	1
the	1
professor,	1
staring.	1
"You	1
blind	1
bat,"	1
cried	1
Bull,	1
"don't	1
you	1
see	1
who	1
is	1
leading	1
them?"	1
They	1
peered	1
again,	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
Colonel,	1
with	1
a	1
catch	1
in	1
his	1
voice,	1
cried	1
out--	1
"Why,	1
it's	1
Renard!"	1
There	1
was,	1
indeed,	1
a	1
rank	1
of	1
dim	1
figures	1
running	1
across	1
the	1
road,	1
and	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
clearly	1
seen;	1
but	1
far	1
enough	1
in	1
front	1
to	1
catch	1
the	1
accident	1
of	1
the	1
evening	1
light	1
was	1
stalking	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
unmistakable	1
Dr.	1
Renard,	1
in	1
a	1
white	1
hat,	1
stroking	1
his	1
long	1
brown	1
beard,	1
and	1
holding	1
a	1
revolver	1
in	1
his	1
left	1
hand.	1
"What	1
a	1
fool	1
I've	1
been!"	1
exclaimed	1
the	1
Colonel.	1
"Of	1
course,	1
the	1
dear	1
old	1
boy	1
has	1
turned	1
out	1
to	1
help	1
us."	1
Dr.	1
Bull	1
was	1
bubbling	1
over	1
with	1
laughter,	1
swinging	1
the	1
sword	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
as	1
carelessly	1
as	1
a	1
cane.	1
He	1
jumped	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
car	1
and	1
ran	1
across	1
the	1
intervening	1
space,	1
calling	1
out--	1
"Dr.	1
Renard!	1
Dr.	1
Renard!"	1
An	1
instant	1
after	1
Syme	1
thought	1
his	1
own	1
eyes	1
had	1
gone	1
mad	1
in	1
his	1
head.	1
For	1
the	1
philanthropic	1
Dr.	1
Renard	1
had	1
deliberately	1
raised	1
his	1
revolver	1
and	1
fired	1
twice	1
at	1
Bull,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
shots	1
rang	1
down	1
the	1
road.	1
Almost	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
second	1
as	1
the	1
puff	1
of	1
white	1
cloud	1
went	1
up	1
from	1
this	1
atrocious	1
explosion	1
a	1
long	1
puff	1
of	1
white	1
cloud	1
went	1
up	1
also	1
from	1
the	1
cigarette	1
of	1
the	1
cynical	1
Ratcliffe.	1
Like	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
he	1
turned	1
a	1
little	1
pale,	1
but	1
he	1
smiled.	1
Dr.	1
Bull,	1
at	1
whom	1
the	1
bullets	1
had	1
been	1
fired,	1
just	1
missing	1
his	1
scalp,	1
stood	1
quite	1
still	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
road	1
without	1
a	1
sign	1
of	1
fear,	1
and	1
then	1
turned	1
very	1
slowly	1
and	1
crawled	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
car,	1
and	1
climbed	1
in	1
with	1
two	1
holes	1
through	1
his	1
hat.	1
"Well,"	1
said	1
the	1
cigarette	1
smoker	1
slowly,	1
"what	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
now?"	1
"I	1
think,"	1
said	1
Dr.	1
Bull	1
with	1
precision,	1
"that	1
I	1
am	1
lying	1
in	1
bed	1
at	1
No.	1
217	1
Peabody	1
Buildings,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
soon	1
wake	1
up	1
with	1
a	1
jump;	1
or,	1
if	1
that's	1
not	1
it,	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
sitting	1
in	1
a	1
small	1
cushioned	1
cell	1
in	1
Hanwell,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
doctor	1
can't	1
make	1
much	1
of	1
my	1
case.	1
But	1
if	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
I	1
don't	1
think,	1
I'll	1
tell	1
you.	1
I	1
don't	1
think	1
what	1
you	1
think.	1
I	1
don't	1
think,	1
and	1
I	1
never	1
shall	1
think,	1
that	1
the	1
mass	1
of	1
ordinary	1
men	1
are	1
a	1
pack	1
of	1
dirty	1
modern	1
thinkers.	1
No,	1
sir,	1
I'm	1
a	1
democrat,	1
and	1
I	1
still	1
don't	1
believe	1
that	1
Sunday	1
could	1
convert	1
one	1
average	1
navvy	1
or	1
counter-jumper.	1
No,	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
mad,	1
but	1
humanity	1
isn't."	1
Syme	1
turned	1
his	1
bright	1
blue	1
eyes	1
on	1
Bull	1
with	1
an	1
earnestness	1
which	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
commonly	1
make	1
clear.	1
"You	1
are	1
a	1
very	1
fine	1
fellow,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"You	1
can	1
believe	1
in	1
a	1
sanity	1
which	1
is	1
not	1
merely	1
your	1
sanity.	1
And	1
you're	1
right	1
enough	1
about	1
humanity,	1
about	1
peasants	1
and	1
people	1
like	1
that	1
jolly	1
old	1
innkeeper.	1
But	1
you're	1
not	1
right	1
about	1
Renard.	1
I	1
suspected	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
first.	1
He's	1
rationalistic,	1
and,	1
what's	1
worse,	1
he's	1
rich.	1
When	1
duty	1
and	1
religion	1
are	1
really	1
destroyed,	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
by	1
the	1
rich."	1
"They	1
are	1
really	1
destroyed	1
now,"	1
said	1
the	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
cigarette,	1
and	1
rose	1
with	1
his	1
hands	1
in	1
his	1
pockets.	1
"The	1
devils	1
are	1
coming	1
on!"	1
The	1
men	1
in	1
the	1
motor-car	1
looked	1
anxiously	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
his	1
dreamy	1
gaze,	1
and	1
they	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
whole	1
regiment	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
road	1
was	1
advancing	1
upon	1
them,	1
Dr.	1
Renard	1
marching	1
furiously	1
in	1
front,	1
his	1
beard	1
flying	1
in	1
the	1
breeze.	1
The	1
Colonel	1
sprang	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
car	1
with	1
an	1
intolerant	1
exclamation.	1
"Gentlemen,"	1
he	1
cried,	1
"the	1
thing	1
is	1
incredible.	1
It	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
practical	1
joke.	1
If	1
you	1
knew	1
Renard	1
as	1
I	1
do--it's	1
like	1
calling	1
Queen	1
Victoria	1
a	1
dynamiter.	1
If	1
you	1
had	1
got	1
the	1
man's	1
character	1
into	1
your	1
head--"	1
"Dr.	1
Bull,"	1
said	1
Syme	1
sardonically,	1
"has	1
at	1
least	1
got	1
it	1
into	1
his	1
hat."	1
"I	1
tell	1
you	1
it	1
can't	1
be!"	1
cried	1
the	1
Colonel,	1
stamping.	1
"Renard	1
shall	1
explain	1
it.	1
He	1
shall	1
explain	1
it	1
to	1
me,"	1
and	1
he	1
strode	1
forward.	1
"Don't	1
be	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
hurry,"	1
drawled	1
the	1
smoker.	1
"He	1
will	1
very	1
soon	1
explain	1
it	1
to	1
all	1
of	1
us."	1
But	1
the	1
impatient	1
Colonel	1
was	1
already	1
out	1
of	1
earshot,	1
advancing	1
towards	1
the	1
advancing	1
enemy.	1
The	1
excited	1
Dr.	1
Renard	1
lifted	1
his	1
pistol	1
again,	1
but	1
perceiving	1
his	1
opponent,	1
hesitated,	1
and	1
the	1
Colonel	1
came	1
face	1
to	1
face	1
with	1
him	1
with	1
frantic	1
gestures	1
of	1
remonstrance.	1
"It	1
is	1
no	1
good,"	1
said	1
Syme.	1
"He	1
will	1
never	1
get	1
anything	1
out	1
of	1
that	1
old	1
heathen.	1
I	1
vote	1
we	1
drive	1
bang	1
through	1
the	1
thick	1
of	1
them,	1
bang	1
as	1
the	1
bullets	1
went	1
through	1
Bull's	1
hat.	1
We	1
may	1
all	1
be	1
killed,	1
but	1
we	1
must	1
kill	1
a	1
tidy	1
number	1
of	1
them."	1
"I	1
won't	1
'ave	1
it,"	1
said	1
Dr.	1
Bull,	1
growing	1
more	1
vulgar	1
in	1
the	1
sincerity	1
of	1
his	1
virtue.	1
"The	1
poor	1
chaps	1
may	1
be	1
making	1
a	1
mistake.	1
Give	1
the	1
Colonel	1
a	1
chance."	1
"Shall	1
we	1
go	1
back,	1
then?"	1
asked	1
the	1
Professor.	1
"No,"	1
said	1
Ratcliffe	1
in	1
a	1
cold	1
voice,	1
"the	1
street	1
behind	1
us	1
is	1
held	1
too.	1
In	1
fact,	1
I	1
seem	1
to	1
see	1
there	1
another	1
friend	1
of	1
yours,	1
Syme."	1
Syme	1
spun	1
round	1
smartly,	1
and	1
stared	1
backwards	1
at	1
the	1
track	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
travelled.	1
He	1
saw	1
an	1
irregular	1
body	1
of	1
horsemen	1
gathering	1
and	1
galloping	1
towards	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
gloom.	1
He	1
saw	1
above	1
the	1
foremost	1
saddle	1
the	1
silver	1
gleam	1
of	1
a	1
sword,	1
and	1
then	1
as	1
it	1
grew	1
nearer	1
the	1
silver	1
gleam	1
of	1
an	1
old	1
man's	1
hair.	1
The	1
next	1
moment,	1
with	1
shattering	1
violence,	1
he	1
had	1
swung	1
the	1
motor	1
round	1
and	1
sent	1
it	1
dashing	1
down	1
the	1
steep	1
side	1
street	1
to	1
the	1
sea,	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
that	1
desired	1
only	1
to	1
die.	1
"What	1
the	1
devil	1
is	1
up?"	1
cried	1
the	1
Professor,	1
seizing	1
his	1
arm.	1
"The	1
morning	1
star	1
has	1
fallen!"	1
said	1
Syme,	1
as	1
his	1
own	1
car	1
went	1
down	1
the	1
darkness	1
like	1
a	1
falling	1
star.	1
The	1
others	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
his	1
words,	1
but	1
when	1
they	1
looked	1
back	1
at	1
the	1
street	1
above	1
they	1
saw	1
the	1
hostile	1
cavalry	1
coming	1
round	1
the	1
corner	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
slopes	1
after	1
them;	1
and	1
foremost	1
of	1
all	1
rode	1
the	1
good	1
innkeeper,	1
flushed	1
with	1
the	1
fiery	1
innocence	1
of	1
the	1
evening	1
light.	1
"The	1
world	1
is	1
insane!"	1
said	1
the	1
Professor,	1
and	1
buried	1
his	1
face	1
in	1
his	1
hands.	1
"No,"	1
said	1
Dr.	1
Bull	1
in	1
adamantine	1
humility,	1
"it	1
is	1
I."	1
"What	1
are	1
we	1
going	1
to	1
do?"	1
asked	1
the	1
Professor.	1
"At	1
this	1
moment,"	1
said	1
Syme,	1
with	1
a	1
scientific	1
detachment,	1
"I	1
think	1
we	1
are	1
going	1
to	1
smash	1
into	1
a	1
lamppost."	1
The	1
next	1
instant	1
the	1
automobile	1
had	1
come	1
with	1
a	1
catastrophic	1
jar	1
against	1
an	1
iron	1
object.	1
The	1
instant	1
after	1
that	1
four	1
men	1
had	1
crawled	1
out	1
from	1
under	1
a	1
chaos	1
of	1
metal,	1
and	1
a	1
tall	1
lean	1
lamp-post	1
that	1
had	1
stood	1
up	1
straight	1
on	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
marine	1
parade	1
stood	1
out,	1
bent	1
and	1
twisted,	1
like	1
the	1
branch	1
of	1
a	1
broken	1
tree.	1
"Well,	1
we	1
smashed	1
something,"	1
said	1
the	1
Professor,	1
with	1
a	1
faint	1
smile.	1
"That's	1
some	1
comfort."	1
"You're	1
becoming	1
an	1
anarchist,"	1
said	1
Syme,	1
dusting	1
his	1
clothes	1
with	1
his	1
instinct	1
of	1
daintiness.	1
"Everyone	1
is,"	1
said	1
Ratcliffe.	1
As	1
they	1
spoke,	1
the	1
white-haired	1
horseman	1
and	1
his	1
followers	1
came	1
thundering	1
from	1
above,	1
and	1
almost	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
moment	1
a	1
dark	1
string	1
of	1
men	1
ran	1
shouting	1
along	1
the	1
sea-front.	1
Syme	1
snatched	1
a	1
sword,	1
and	1
took	1
it	1
in	1
his	1
teeth;	1
he	1
stuck	1
two	1
others	1
under	1
his	1
arm-pits,	1
took	1
a	1
fourth	1
in	1
his	1
left	1
hand	1
and	1
the	1
lantern	1
in	1
his	1
right,	1
and	1
leapt	1
off	1
the	1
high	1
parade	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
beach	1
below.	1
The	1
others	1
leapt	1
after	1
him,	1
with	1
a	1
common	1
acceptance	1
of	1
such	1
decisive	1
action,	1
leaving	1
the	1
debris	1
and	1
the	1
gathering	1
mob	1
above	1
them.	1
"We	1
have	1
one	1
more	1
chance,"	1
said	1
Syme,	1
taking	1
the	1
steel	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
mouth.	1
"Whatever	1
all	1
this	1
pandemonium	1
means,	1
I	1
suppose	1
the	1
police	1
station	1
will	1
help	1
us.	1
We	1
can't	1
get	1
there,	1
for	1
they	1
hold	1
the	1
way.	1
But	1
there's	1
a	1
pier	1
or	1
breakwater	1
runs	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
sea	1
just	1
here,	1
which	1
we	1
could	1
defend	1
longer	1
than	1
anything	1
else,	1
like	1
Horatius	1
and	1
his	1
bridge.	1
We	1
must	1
defend	1
it	1
till	1
the	1
Gendarmerie	1
turn	1
out.	1
Keep	1
after	1
me."	1
They	1
followed	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
crunching	1
down	1
the	1
beach,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
second	1
or	1
two	1
their	1
boots	1
broke	1
not	1
on	1
the	1
sea	1
gravel,	1
but	1
on	1
broad,	1
flat	1
stones.	1
They	1
marched	1
down	1
a	1
long,	1
low	1
jetty,	1
running	1
out	1
in	1
one	1
arm	1
into	1
the	1
dim,	1
boiling	1
sea,	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
it	1
they	1
felt	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
their	1
story.	1
They	1
turned	1
and	1
faced	1
the	1
town.	1
That	1
town	1
was	1
transfigured	1
with	1
uproar.	1
All	1
along	1
the	1
high	1
parade	1
from	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
just	1
descended	1
was	1
a	1
dark	1
and	1
roaring	1
stream	1
of	1
humanity,	1
with	1
tossing	1
arms	1
and	1
fiery	1
faces,	1
groping	1
and	1
glaring	1
towards	1
them.	1
The	1
long	1
dark	1
line	1
was	1
dotted	1
with	1
torches	1
and	1
lanterns;	1
but	1
even	1
where	1
no	1
flame	1
lit	1
up	1
a	1
furious	1
face,	1
they	1
could	1
see	1
in	1
the	1
farthest	1
figure,	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
shadowy	1
gesture,	1
an	1
organised	1
hate.	1
It	1
was	1
clear	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
the	1
accursed	1
of	1
all	1
men,	1
and	1
they	1
knew	1
not	1
why.	1
Two	1
or	1
three	1
men,	1
looking	1
little	1
and	1
black	1
like	1
monkeys,	1
leapt	1
over	1
the	1
edge	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
done	1
and	1
dropped	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
beach.	1
These	1
came	1
ploughing	1
down	1
the	1
deep	1
sand,	1
shouting	1
horribly,	1
and	1
strove	1
to	1
wade	1
into	1
the	1
sea	1
at	1
random.	1
The	1
example	1
was	1
followed,	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
black	1
mass	1
of	1
men	1
began	1
to	1
run	1
and	1
drip	1
over	1
the	1
edge	1
like	1
black	1
treacle.	1
Foremost	1
among	1
the	1
men	1
on	1
the	1
beach	1
Syme	1
saw	1
the	1
peasant	1
who	1
had	1
driven	1
their	1
cart.	1
He	1
splashed	1
into	1
the	1
surf	1
on	1
a	1
huge	1
cart-horse,	1
and	1
shook	1
his	1
axe	1
at	1
them.	1
"The	1
peasant!"	1
cried	1
Syme.	1
"They	1
have	1
not	1
risen	1
since	1
the	1
Middle	1
Ages."	1
"Even	1
if	1
the	1
police	1
do	1
come	1
now,"	1
said	1
the	1
Professor	1
mournfully,	1
"they	1
can	1
do	1
nothing	1
with	1
this	1
mob."	1
"Nonsence!"	1
said	1
Bull	1
desperately;	1
"there	1
must	1
be	1
some	1
people	1
left	1
in	1
the	1
town	1
who	1
are	1
human."	1
"No,"	1
said	1
the	1
hopeless	1
Inspector,	1
"the	1
human	1
being	1
will	1
soon	1
be	1
extinct.	1
We	1
are	1
the	1
last	1
of	1
mankind."	1
"It	1
may	1
be,"	1
said	1
the	1
Professor	1
absently.	1
Then	1
he	1
added	1
in	1
his	1
dreamy	1
voice,	1
"What	1
is	1
all	1
that	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
'Dunciad'?	1
'Nor	1
public	1
flame;	1
nor	1
private,	1
dares	1
to	1
shine;	1
Nor	1
human	1
light	1
is	1
left,	1
nor	1
glimpse	1
divine!	1
Lo!	1
thy	1
dread	1
Empire,	1
Chaos,	1
is	1
restored;	1
Light	1
dies	1
before	1
thine	1
uncreating	1
word:	1
Thy	1
hand,	1
great	1
Anarch,	1
lets	1
the	1
curtain	1
fall;	1
And	1
universal	1
darkness	1
buries	1
all."'	1
"Stop!"	1
cried	1
Bull	1
suddenly,	1
"the	1
gendarmes	1
are	1
out."	1
The	1
low	1
lights	1
of	1
the	1
police	1
station	1
were	1
indeed	1
blotted	1
and	1
broken	1
with	1
hurrying	1
figures,	1
and	1
they	1
heard	1
through	1
the	1
darkness	1
the	1
clash	1
and	1
jingle	1
of	1
a	1
disciplined	1
cavalry.	1
"They	1
are	1
charging	1
the	1
mob!"	1
cried	1
Bull	1
in	1
ecstacy	1
or	1
alarm.	1
"No,"	1
said	1
Syme,	1
"they	1
are	1
formed	1
along	1
the	1
parade."	1
"They	1
have	1
unslung	1
their	1
carbines,"	1
cried	1
Bull	1
dancing	1
with	1
excitement.	1
"Yes,"	1
said	1
Ratcliffe,	1
"and	1
they	1
are	1
going	1
to	1
fire	1
on	1
us."	1
As	1
he	1
spoke	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
long	1
crackle	1
of	1
musketry,	1
and	1
bullets	1
seemed	1
to	1
hop	1
like	1
hailstones	1
on	1
the	1
stones	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
them.	1
"The	1
gendarmes	1
have	1
joined	1
them!"	1
cried	1
the	1
Professor,	1
and	1
struck	1
his	1
forehead.	1
"I	1
am	1
in	1
the	1
padded	1
cell,"	1
said	1
Bull	1
solidly.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
long	1
silence,	1
and	1
then	1
Ratcliffe	1
said,	1
looking	1
out	1
over	1
the	1
swollen	1
sea,	1
all	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
grey	1
purple--	1
"What	1
does	1
it	1
matter	1
who	1
is	1
mad	1
or	1
who	1
is	1
sane?	1
We	1
shall	1
all	1
be	1
dead	1
soon."	1
Syme	1
turned	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
said--	1
"You	1
are	1
quite	1
hopeless,	1
then?"	1
Mr.	1
Ratcliffe	1
kept	1
a	1
stony	1
silence;	1
then	1
at	1
last	1
he	1
said	1
quietly--	1
"No;	1
oddly	1
enough	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
quite	1
hopeless.	1
There	1
is	1
one	1
insane	1
little	1
hope	1
that	1
I	1
cannot	1
get	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
mind.	1
The	1
power	1
of	1
this	1
whole	1
planet	1
is	1
against	1
us,	1
yet	1
I	1
cannot	1
help	1
wondering	1
whether	1
this	1
one	1
silly	1
little	1
hope	1
is	1
hopeless	1
yet."	1
"In	1
what	1
or	1
whom	1
is	1
your	1
hope?"	1
asked	1
Syme	1
with	1
curiosity.	1
"In	1
a	1
man	1
I	1
never	1
saw,"	1
said	1
the	1
other,	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
leaden	1
sea.	1
"I	1
know	1
what	1
you	1
mean,"	1
said	1
Syme	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice,	1
"the	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
dark	1
room.	1
But	1
Sunday	1
must	1
have	1
killed	1
him	1
by	1
now."	1
"Perhaps,"	1
said	1
the	1
other	1
steadily;	1
"but	1
if	1
so,	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
man	1
whom	1
Sunday	1
found	1
it	1
hard	1
to	1
kill."	1
"I	1
heard	1
what	1
you	1
said,"	1
said	1
the	1
Professor,	1
with	1
his	1
back	1
turned.	1
"I	1
also	1
am	1
holding	1
hard	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
thing	1
I	1
never	1
saw."	1
All	1
of	1
a	1
sudden	1
Syme,	1
who	1
was	1
standing	1
as	1
if	1
blind	1
with	1
introspective	1
thought,	1
swung	1
round	1
and	1
cried	1
out,	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
waking	1
from	1
sleep--	1
"Where	1
is	1
the	1
Colonel?	1
I	1
thought	1
he	1
was	1
with	1
us!"	1
"The	1
Colonel!	1
Yes,"	1
cried	1
Bull,	1
"where	1
on	1
earth	1
is	1
the	1
Colonel?"	1
"He	1
went	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
Renard,"	1
said	1
the	1
Professor.	1
"We	1
cannot	1
leave	1
him	1
among	1
all	1
those	1
beasts,"	1
cried	1
Syme.	1
"Let	1
us	1
die	1
like	1
gentlemen	1
if--"	1
"Do	1
not	1
pity	1
the	1
Colonel,"	1
said	1
Ratcliffe,	1
with	1
a	1
pale	1
sneer.	1
"He	1
is	1
extremely	1
comfortable.	1
He	1
is--"	1
"No!	1
no!	1
no!"	1
cried	1
Syme	1
in	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
frenzy,	1
"not	1
the	1
Colonel	1
too!	1
I	1
will	1
never	1
believe	1
it!"	1
"Will	1
you	1
believe	1
your	1
eyes?"	1
asked	1
the	1
other,	1
and	1
pointed	1
to	1
the	1
beach.	1
Many	1
of	1
their	1
pursuers	1
had	1
waded	1
into	1
the	1
water	1
shaking	1
their	1
fists,	1
but	1
the	1
sea	1
was	1
rough,	1
and	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
reach	1
the	1
pier.	1
Two	1
or	1
three	1
figures,	1
however,	1
stood	1
on	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
stone	1
footway,	1
and	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
cautiously	1
advancing	1
down	1
it.	1
The	1
glare	1
of	1
a	1
chance	1
lantern	1
lit	1
up	1
the	1
faces	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
foremost.	1
One	1
face	1
wore	1
a	1
black	1
half-mask,	1
and	1
under	1
it	1
the	1
mouth	1
was	1
twisting	1
about	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
madness	1
of	1
nerves	1
that	1
the	1
black	1
tuft	1
of	1
beard	1
wriggled	1
round	1
and	1
round	1
like	1
a	1
restless,	1
living	1
thing.	1
The	1
other	1
was	1
the	1
red	1
face	1
and	1
white	1
moustache	1
of	1
Colonel	1
Ducroix.	1
They	1
were	1
in	1
earnest	1
consultation.	1
"Yes,	1
he	1
is	1
gone	1
too,"	1
said	1
the	1
Professor,	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
a	1
stone.	1
"Everything's	1
gone.	1
I'm	1
gone!	1
I	1
can't	1
trust	1
my	1
own	1
bodily	1
machinery.	1
I	1
feel	1
as	1
if	1
my	1
own	1
hand	1
might	1
fly	1
up	1
and	1
strike	1
me."	1
"When	1
my	1
hand	1
flies	1
up,"	1
said	1
Syme,	1
"it	1
will	1
strike	1
somebody	1
else,"	1
and	1
he	1
strode	1
along	1
the	1
pier	1
towards	1
the	1
Colonel,	1
the	1
sword	1
in	1
one	1
hand	1
and	1
the	1
lantern	1
in	1
the	1
other.	1
As	1
if	1
to	1
destroy	1
the	1
last	1
hope	1
or	1
doubt,	1
the	1
Colonel,	1
who	1
saw	1
him	1
coming,	1
pointed	1
his	1
revolver	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
fired.	1
The	1
shot	1
missed	1
Syme,	1
but	1
struck	1
his	1
sword,	1
breaking	1
it	1
short	1
at	1
the	1
hilt.	1
Syme	1
rushed	1
on,	1
and	1
swung	1
the	1
iron	1
lantern	1
above	1
his	1
head.	1
"Judas	1
before	1
Herod!"	1
he	1
said,	1
and	1
struck	1
the	1
Colonel	1
down	1
upon	1
the	1
stones.	1
Then	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
Secretary,	1
whose	1
frightful	1
mouth	1
was	1
almost	1
foaming	1
now,	1
and	1
held	1
the	1
lamp	1
high	1
with	1
so	1
rigid	1
and	1
arresting	1
a	1
gesture,	1
that	1
the	1
man	1
was,	1
as	1
it	1
were,	1
frozen	1
for	1
a	1
moment,	1
and	1
forced	1
to	1
hear.	1
"Do	1
you	1
see	1
this	1
lantern?"	1
cried	1
Syme	1
in	1
a	1
terrible	1
voice.	1
"Do	1
you	1
see	1
the	1
cross	1
carved	1
on	1
it,	1
and	1
the	1
flame	1
inside?	1
You	1
did	1
not	1
make	1
it.	1
You	1
did	1
not	1
light	1
it,	1
Better	1
men	1
than	1
you,	1
men	1
who	1
could	1
believe	1
and	1
obey,	1
twisted	1
the	1
entrails	1
of	1
iron	1
and	1
preserved	1
the	1
legend	1
of	1
fire.	1
There	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
street	1
you	1
walk	1
on,	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
thread	1
you	1
wear,	1
that	1
was	1
not	1
made	1
as	1
this	1
lantern	1
was,	1
by	1
denying	1
your	1
philosophy	1
of	1
dirt	1
and	1
rats.	1
You	1
can	1
make	1
nothing.	1
You	1
can	1
only	1
destroy.	1
You	1
will	1
destroy	1
mankind;	1
you	1
will	1
destroy	1
the	1
world.	1
Let	1
that	1
suffice	1
you.	1
Yet	1
this	1
one	1
old	1
Christian	1
lantern	1
you	1
shall	1
not	1
destroy.	1
It	1
shall	1
go	1
where	1
your	1
empire	1
of	1
apes	1
will	1
never	1
have	1
the	1
wit	1
to	1
find	1
it."	1
He	1
struck	1
the	1
Secretary	1
once	1
with	1
the	1
lantern	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
staggered;	1
and	1
then,	1
whirling	1
it	1
twice	1
round	1
his	1
head,	1
sent	1
it	1
flying	1
far	1
out	1
to	1
sea,	1
where	1
it	1
flared	1
like	1
a	1
roaring	1
rocket	1
and	1
fell.	1
"Swords!"	1
shouted	1
Syme,	1
turning	1
his	1
flaming	1
face	1
;	1
to	1
the	1
three	1
behind	1
him.	1
"Let	1
us	1
charge	1
these	1
dogs,	1
for	1
our	1
time	1
has	1
come	1
to	1
die."	1
His	1
three	1
companions	1
came	1
after	1
him	1
sword	1
in	1
hand.	1
Syme's	1
sword	1
was	1
broken,	1
but	1
he	1
rent	1
a	1
bludgeon	1
from	1
the	1
fist	1
of	1
a	1
fisherman,	1
flinging	1
him	1
down.	1
In	1
a	1
moment	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
flung	1
themselves	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
mob	1
and	1
perished,	1
when	1
an	1
interruption	1
came.	1
The	1
Secretary,	1
ever	1
since	1
Syme's	1
speech,	1
had	1
stood	1
with	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
his	1
stricken	1
head	1
as	1
if	1
dazed;	1
now	1
he	1
suddenly	1
pulled	1
off	1
his	1
black	1
mask.	1
The	1
pale	1
face	1
thus	1
peeled	1
in	1
the	1
lamplight	1
revealed	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
rage	1
as	1
astonishment.	1
He	1
put	1
up	1
his	1
hand	1
with	1
an	1
anxious	1
authority.	1
"There	1
is	1
some	1
mistake,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"Mr.	1
Syme,	1
I	1
hardly	1
think	1
you	1
understand	1
your	1
position.	1
I	1
arrest	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
law."	1
"Of	1
the	1
law?"	1
said	1
Syme,	1
and	1
dropped	1
his	1
stick.	1
"Certainly!"	1
said	1
the	1
Secretary.	1
"I	1
am	1
a	1
detective	1
from	1
Scotland	1
Yard,"	1
and	1
he	1
took	1
a	1
small	1
blue	1
card	1
from	1
his	1
pocket.	1
"And	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
suppose	1
we	1
are?"	1
asked	1
the	1
Professor,	1
and	1
threw	1
up	1
his	1
arms.	1
"You,"	1
said	1
the	1
Secretary	1
stiffly,	1
"are,	1
as	1
I	1
know	1
for	1
a	1
fact,	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
Supreme	1
Anarchist	1
Council.	1
Disguised	1
as	1
one	1
of	1
you,	1
I--"	1
Dr.	1
Bull	1
tossed	1
his	1
sword	1
into	1
the	1
sea.	1
"There	1
never	1
was	1
any	1
Supreme	1
Anarchist	1
Council,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"We	1
were	1
all	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
silly	1
policemen	1
looking	1
at	1
each	1
other.	1
And	1
all	1
these	1
nice	1
people	1
who	1
have	1
been	1
peppering	1
us	1
with	1
shot	1
thought	1
we	1
were	1
the	1
dynamiters.	1
I	1
knew	1
I	1
couldn't	1
be	1
wrong	1
about	1
the	1
mob,"	1
he	1
said,	1
beaming	1
over	1
the	1
enormous	1
multitude,	1
which	1
stretched	1
away	1
to	1
the	1
distance	1
on	1
both	1
sides.	1
"Vulgar	1
people	1
are	1
never	1
mad.	1
I'm	1
vulgar	1
myself,	1
and	1
I	1
know.	1
I	1
am	1
now	1
going	1
on	1
shore	1
to	1
stand	1
a	1
drink	1
to	1
everybody	1
here."	1
CHAPTER	1
XIII	1
THE	1
PURSUIT	1
OF	1
THE	1
PRESIDENT	1
NEXT	1
morning	1
five	1
bewildered	1
but	1
hilarious	1
people	1
took	1
the	1
boat	1
for	1
Dover.	1
The	1
poor	1
old	1
Colonel	1
might	1
have	1
had	1
some	1
cause	1
to	1
complain,	1
having	1
been	1
first	1
forced	1
to	1
fight	1
for	1
two	1
factions	1
that	1
didn't	1
exist,	1
and	1
then	1
knocked	1
down	1
with	1
an	1
iron	1
lantern.	1
But	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
magnanimous	1
old	1
gentleman,	1
and	1
being	1
much	1
relieved	1
that	1
neither	1
party	1
had	1
anything	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
dynamite,	1
he	1
saw	1
them	1
off	1
on	1
the	1
pier	1
with	1
great	1
geniality.	1
The	1
five	1
reconciled	1
detectives	1
had	1
a	1
hundred	1
details	1
to	1
explain	1
to	1
each	1
other.	1
The	1
Secretary	1
had	1
to	1
tell	1
Syme	1
how	1
they	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
wear	1
masks	1
originally	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
approach	1
the	1
supposed	1
enemy	1
as	1
fellow-conspirators;	1
Syme	1
had	1
to	1
explain	1
how	1
they	1
had	1
fled	1
with	1
such	1
swiftness	1
through	1
a	1
civilised	1
country.	1
But	1
above	1
all	1
these	1
matters	1
of	1
detail	1
which	1
could	1
be	1
explained,	1
rose	1
the	1
central	1
mountain	1
of	1
the	1
matter	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
explain.	1
What	1
did	1
it	1
all	1
mean?	1
If	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
harmless	1
officers,	1
what	1
was	1
Sunday?	1
If	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
seized	1
the	1
world,	1
what	1
on	1
earth	1
had	1
he	1
been	1
up	1
to?	1
Inspector	1
Ratcliffe	1
was	1
still	1
gloomy	1
about	1
this.	1
"I	1
can't	1
make	1
head	1
or	1
tail	1
of	1
old	1
Sunday's	1
little	1
game	1
any	1
more	1
than	1
you	1
can,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"But	1
whatever	1
else	1
Sunday	1
is,	1
he	1
isn't	1
a	1
blameless	1
citizen.	1
Damn	1
it!	1
do	1
you	1
remember	1
his	1
face?"	1
"I	1
grant	1
you,"	1
answered	1
Syme,	1
"that	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
forget	1
it."	1
"Well,"	1
said	1
the	1
Secretary,	1
"I	1
suppose	1
we	1
can	1
find	1
out	1
soon,	1
for	1
tomorrow	1
we	1
have	1
our	1
next	1
general	1
meeting.	1
You	1
will	1
excuse	1
me,"	1
he	1
said,	1
with	1
a	1
rather	1
ghastly	1
smile,	1
"for	1
being	1
well	1
acquainted	1
with	1
my	1
secretarial	1
duties."	1
"I	1
suppose	1
you	1
are	1
right,"	1
said	1
the	1
Professor	1
reflectively.	1
"I	1
suppose	1
we	1
might	1
find	1
it	1
out	1
from	1
him;	1
but	1
I	1
confess	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
feel	1
a	1
bit	1
afraid	1
of	1
asking	1
Sunday	1
who	1
he	1
really	1
is."	1
"Why,"	1
asked	1
the	1
Secretary,	1
"for	1
fear	1
of	1
bombs?"	1
"No,"	1
said	1
the	1
Professor,	1
"for	1
fear	1
he	1
might	1
tell	1
me."	1
"Let	1
us	1
have	1
some	1
drinks,"	1
said	1
Dr.	1
Bull,	1
after	1
a	1
silence.	1
Throughout	1
their	1
whole	1
journey	1
by	1
boat	1
and	1
train	1
they	1
were	1
highly	1
convivial,	1
but	1
they	1
instinctively	1
kept	1
together.	1
Dr.	1
Bull,	1
who	1
had	1
always	1
been	1
the	1
optimist	1
of	1
the	1
party,	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
persuade	1
the	1
other	1
four	1
that	1
the	1
whole	1
company	1
could	1
take	1
the	1
same	1
hansom	1
cab	1
from	1
Victoria;	1
but	1
this	1
was	1
over-ruled,	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
in	1
a	1
four-wheeler,	1
with	1
Dr.	1
Bull	1
on	1
the	1
box,	1
singing.	1
They	1
finished	1
their	1
journey	1
at	1
an	1
hotel	1
in	1
Piccadilly	1
Circus,	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
early	1
breakfast	1
next	1
morning	1
in	1
Leicester	1
Square.	1
Yet	1
even	1
then	1
the	1
adventures	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
were	1
not	1
entirely	1
over.	1
Dr.	1
Bull,	1
discontented	1
with	1
the	1
general	1
proposal	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
bed,	1
had	1
strolled	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hotel	1
at	1
about	1
eleven	1
to	1
see	1
and	1
taste	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
beauties	1
of	1
London.	1
Twenty	1
minutes	1
afterwards,	1
however,	1
he	1
came	1
back	1
and	1
made	1
quite	1
a	1
clamour	1
in	1
the	1
hall.	1
Syme,	1
who	1
tried	1
at	1
first	1
to	1
soothe	1
him,	1
was	1
forced	1
at	1
last	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
his	1
communication	1
with	1
quite	1
new	1
attention.	1
"I	1
tell	1
you	1
I've	1
seen	1
him!"	1
said	1
Dr.	1
Bull,	1
with	1
thick	1
emphasis.	1
"Whom?"	1
asked	1
Syme	1
quickly.	1
"Not	1
the	1
President?"	1
"Not	1
so	1
bad	1
as	1
that,"	1
said	1
Dr.	1
Bull,	1
with	1
unnecessary	1
laughter,	1
"not	1
so	1
bad	1
as	1
that.	1
I've	1
got	1
him	1
here."	1
"Got	1
whom	1
here?"	1
asked	1
Syme	1
impatiently.	1
"Hairy	1
man,"	1
said	1
the	1
other	1
lucidly,	1
"man	1
that	1
used	1
to	1
be	1
hairy	1
man--Gogol.	1
Here	1
he	1
is,"	1
and	1
he	1
pulled	1
forward	1
by	1
a	1
reluctant	1
elbow	1
the	1
identical	1
young	1
man	1
who	1
five	1
days	1
before	1
had	1
marched	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
Council	1
with	1
thin	1
red	1
hair	1
and	1
a	1
pale	1
face,	1
the	1
first	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
sham	1
anarchists	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
exposed.	1
"Why	1
do	1
you	1
worry	1
with	1
me?"	1
he	1
cried.	1
"You	1
have	1
expelled	1
me	1
as	1
a	1
spy."	1
"We	1
are	1
all	1
spies!"	1
whispered	1
Syme.	1
"We're	1
all	1
spies!"	1
shouted	1
Dr.	1
Bull.	1
"Come	1
and	1
have	1
a	1
drink."	1
Next	1
morning	1
the	1
battalion	1
of	1
the	1
reunited	1
six	1
marched	1
stolidly	1
towards	1
the	1
hotel	1
in	1
Leicester	1
Square.	1
"This	1
is	1
more	1
cheerful,"	1
said	1
Dr.	1
Bull;	1
"we	1
are	1
six	1
men	1
going	1
to	1
ask	1
one	1
man	1
what	1
he	1
means."	1
"I	1
think	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
bit	1
queerer	1
than	1
that,"	1
said	1
Syme.	1
"I	1
think	1
it	1
is	1
six	1
men	1
going	1
to	1
ask	1
one	1
man	1
what	1
they	1
mean."	1
They	1
turned	1
in	1
silence	1
into	1
the	1
Square,	1
and	1
though	1
the	1
hotel	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
opposite	1
corner,	1
they	1
saw	1
at	1
once	1
the	1
little	1
balcony	1
and	1
a	1
figure	1
that	1
looked	1
too	1
big	1
for	1
it.	1
He	1
was	1
sitting	1
alone	1
with	1
bent	1
head,	1
poring	1
over	1
a	1
newspaper.	1
But	1
all	1
his	1
councillors,	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
vote	1
him	1
down,	1
crossed	1
that	1
Square	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
watched	1
out	1
of	1
heaven	1
by	1
a	1
hundred	1
eyes.	1
They	1
had	1
disputed	1
much	1
upon	1
their	1
policy,	1
about	1
whether	1
they	1
should	1
leave	1
the	1
unmasked	1
Gogol	1
without	1
and	1
begin	1
diplomatically,	1
or	1
whether	1
they	1
should	1
bring	1
him	1
in	1
and	1
blow	1
up	1
the	1
gunpowder	1
at	1
once.	1
The	1
influence	1
of	1
Syme	1
and	1
Bull	1
prevailed	1
for	1
the	1
latter	1
course,	1
though	1
the	1
Secretary	1
to	1
the	1
last	1
asked	1
them	1
why	1
they	1
attacked	1
Sunday	1
so	1
rashly.	1
"My	1
reason	1
is	1
quite	1
simple,"	1
said	1
Syme.	1
"I	1
attack	1
him	1
rashly	1
because	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
of	1
him."	1
They	1
followed	1
Syme	1
up	1
the	1
dark	1
stair	1
in	1
silence,	1
and	1
they	1
all	1
came	1
out	1
simultaneously	1
into	1
the	1
broad	1
sunlight	1
of	1
the	1
morning	1
and	1
the	1
broad	1
sunlight	1
of	1
Sunday's	1
smile.	1
"Delightful!"	1
he	1
said.	1
"So	1
pleased	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
all.	1
What	1
an	1
exquisite	1
day	1
it	1
is.	1
Is	1
the	1
Czar	1
dead?"	1
The	1
Secretary,	1
who	1
happened	1
to	1
be	1
foremost,	1
drew	1
himself	1
together	1
for	1
a	1
dignified	1
outburst.	1
"No,	1
sir,"	1
he	1
said	1
sternly	1
"there	1
has	1
been	1
no	1
massacre.	1
I	1
bring	1
you	1
news	1
of	1
no	1
such	1
disgusting	1
spectacles."	1
"Disgusting	1
spectacles?"	1
repeated	1
the	1
President,	1
with	1
a	1
bright,	1
inquiring	1
smile.	1
"You	1
mean	1
Dr.	1
Bull's	1
spectacles?"	1
The	1
Secretary	1
choked	1
for	1
a	1
moment,	1
and	1
the	1
President	1
went	1
on	1
with	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
smooth	1
appeal--	1
"Of	1
course,	1
we	1
all	1
have	1
our	1
opinions	1
and	1
even	1
our	1
eyes,	1
but	1
really	1
to	1
call	1
them	1
disgusting	1
before	1
the	1
man	1
himself--"	1
Dr.	1
Bull	1
tore	1
off	1
his	1
spectacles	1
and	1
broke	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
table.	1
"My	1
spectacles	1
are	1
blackguardly,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"but	1
I'm	1
not.	1
Look	1
at	1
my	1
face."	1
"I	1
dare	1
say	1
it's	1
the	1
sort	1
of	1
face	1
that	1
grows	1
on	1
one,"	1
said	1
the	1
President,	1
"in	1
fact,	1
it	1
grows	1
on	1
you;	1
and	1
who	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
quarrel	1
with	1
the	1
wild	1
fruits	1
upon	1
the	1
Tree	1
of	1
Life?	1
I	1
dare	1
say	1
it	1
will	1
grow	1
on	1
me	1
some	1
day."	1
"We	1
have	1
no	1
time	1
for	1
tomfoolery,"	1
said	1
the	1
Secretary,	1
breaking	1
in	1
savagely.	1
"We	1
have	1
come	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
all	1
this	1
means.	1
Who	1
are	1
you?	1
What	1
are	1
you?	1
Why	1
did	1
you	1
get	1
us	1
all	1
here?	1
Do	1
you	1
know	1
who	1
and	1
what	1
we	1
are?	1
Are	1
you	1
a	1
half-witted	1
man	1
playing	1
the	1
conspirator,	1
or	1
are	1
you	1
a	1
clever	1
man	1
playing	1
the	1
fool?	1
Answer	1
me,	1
I	1
tell	1
you."	1
"Candidates,"	1
murmured	1
Sunday,	1
"are	1
only	1
required	1
to	1
answer	1
eight	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
seventeen	1
questions	1
on	1
the	1
paper.	1
As	1
far	1
as	1
I	1
can	1
make	1
out,	1
you	1
want	1
me	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
what	1
I	1
am,	1
and	1
what	1
you	1
are,	1
and	1
what	1
this	1
table	1
is,	1
and	1
what	1
this	1
Council	1
is,	1
and	1
what	1
this	1
world	1
is	1
for	1
all	1
I	1
know.	1
Well,	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
to	1
rend	1
the	1
veil	1
of	1
one	1
mystery.	1
If	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
you	1
are,	1
you	1
are	1
a	1
set	1
of	1
highly	1
well-intentioned	1
young	1
jackasses."	1
"And	1
you,"	1
said	1
Syme,	1
leaning	1
forward,	1
"what	1
are	1
you?"	1
"I?	1
What	1
am	1
I?"	1
roared	1
the	1
President,	1
and	1
he	1
rose	1
slowly	1
to	1
an	1
incredible	1
height,	1
like	1
some	1
enormous	1
wave	1
about	1
to	1
arch	1
above	1
them	1
and	1
break.	1
"You	1
want	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
I	1
am,	1
do	1
you?	1
Bull,	1
you	1
are	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
science.	1
Grub	1
in	1
the	1
roots	1
of	1
those	1
trees	1
and	1
find	1
out	1
the	1
truth	1
about	1
them.	1
Syme,	1
you	1
are	1
a	1
poet.	1
Stare	1
at	1
those	1
morning	1
clouds.	1
But	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
this,	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
have	1
found	1
out	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
the	1
last	1
tree	1
and	1
the	1
top-most	1
cloud	1
before	1
the	1
truth	1
about	1
me.	1
You	1
will	1
understand	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
still	1
a	1
riddle;	1
you	1
shall	1
know	1
what	1
the	1
stars	1
are,	1
and	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
I	1
am.	1
Since	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
all	1
men	1
have	1
hunted	1
me	1
like	1
a	1
wolf--kings	1
and	1
sages,	1
and	1
poets	1
and	1
lawgivers,	1
all	1
the	1
churches,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
philosophies.	1
But	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
been	1
caught	1
yet,	1
and	1
the	1
skies	1
will	1
fall	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
I	1
turn	1
to	1
bay.	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
them	1
a	1
good	1
run	1
for	1
their	1
money,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
now."	1
Before	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
could	1
move,	1
the	1
monstrous	1
man	1
had	1
swung	1
himself	1
like	1
some	1
huge	1
ourang-outang	1
over	1
the	1
balustrade	1
of	1
the	1
balcony.	1
Yet	1
before	1
he	1
dropped	1
he	1
pulled	1
himself	1
up	1
again	1
as	1
on	1
a	1
horizontal	1
bar,	1
and	1
thrusting	1
his	1
great	1
chin	1
over	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
balcony,	1
said	1
solemnly--	1
"There's	1
one	1
thing	1
I'll	1
tell	1
you	1
though	1
about	1
who	1
I	1
am.	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
dark	1
room,	1
who	1
made	1
you	1
all	1
policemen."	1
With	1
that	1
he	1
fell	1
from	1
the	1
balcony,	1
bouncing	1
on	1
the	1
stones	1
below	1
like	1
a	1
great	1
ball	1
of	1
india-rubber,	1
and	1
went	1
bounding	1
off	1
towards	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
Alhambra,	1
where	1
he	1
hailed	1
a	1
hansom-cab	1
and	1
sprang	1
inside	1
it.	1
The	1
six	1
detectives	1
had	1
been	1
standing	1
thunderstruck	1
and	1
livid	1
in	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
his	1
last	1
assertion;	1
but	1
when	1
he	1
disappeared	1
into	1
the	1
cab,	1
Syme's	1
practical	1
senses	1
returned	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
leaping	1
over	1
the	1
balcony	1
so	1
recklessly	1
as	1
almost	1
to	1
break	1
his	1
legs,	1
he	1
called	1
another	1
cab.	1
He	1
and	1
Bull	1
sprang	1
into	1
the	1
cab	1
together,	1
the	1
Professor	1
and	1
the	1
Inspector	1
into	1
another,	1
while	1
the	1
Secretary	1
and	1
the	1
late	1
Gogol	1
scrambled	1
into	1
a	1
third	1
just	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
pursue	1
the	1
flying	1
Syme,	1
who	1
was	1
pursuing	1
the	1
flying	1
President.	1
Sunday	1
led	1
them	1
a	1
wild	1
chase	1
towards	1
the	1
north-west,	1
his	1
cabman,	1
evidently	1
under	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
more	1
than	1
common	1
inducements,	1
urging	1
the	1
horse	1
at	1
breakneck	1
speed.	1
But	1
Syme	1
was	1
in	1
no	1
mood	1
for	1
delicacies,	1
and	1
he	1
stood	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
cab	1
shouting,	1
"Stop	1
thief!"	1
until	1
crowds	1
ran	1
along	1
beside	1
his	1
cab,	1
and	1
policemen	1
began	1
to	1
stop	1
and	1
ask	1
questions.	1
All	1
this	1
had	1
its	1
influence	1
upon	1
the	1
President's	1
cabman,	1
who	1
began	1
to	1
look	1
dubious,	1
and	1
to	1
slow	1
down	1
to	1
a	1
trot.	1
He	1
opened	1
the	1
trap	1
to	1
talk	1
reasonably	1
to	1
his	1
fare,	1
and	1
in	1
so	1
doing	1
let	1
the	1
long	1
whip	1
droop	1
over	1
the	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
cab.	1
Sunday	1
leant	1
forward,	1
seized	1
it,	1
and	1
jerked	1
it	1
violently	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
man's	1
hand.	1
Then	1
standing	1
up	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
cab	1
himself,	1
he	1
lashed	1
the	1
horse	1
and	1
roared	1
aloud,	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
went	1
down	1
the	1
streets	1
like	1
a	1
flying	1
storm.	1
Through	1
street	1
after	1
street	1
and	1
square	1
after	1
square	1
went	1
whirling	1
this	1
preposterous	1
vehicle,	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
fare	1
was	1
urging	1
the	1
horse	1
and	1
the	1
driver	1
trying	1
desperately	1
to	1
stop	1
it.	1
The	1
other	1
three	1
cabs	1
came	1
after	1
it	1
(if	1
the	1
phrase	1
be	1
permissible	1
of	1
a	1
cab)	1
like	1
panting	1
hounds.	1
Shops	1
and	1
streets	1
shot	1
by	1
like	1
rattling	1
arrows.	1
At	1
the	1
highest	1
ecstacy	1
of	1
speed,	1
Sunday	1
turned	1
round	1
on	1
the	1
splashboard	1
where	1
he	1
stood,	1
and	1
sticking	1
his	1
great	1
grinning	1
head	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
cab,	1
with	1
white	1
hair	1
whistling	1
in	1
the	1
wind,	1
he	1
made	1
a	1
horrible	1
face	1
at	1
his	1
pursuers,	1
like	1
some	1
colossal	1
urchin.	1
Then	1
raising	1
his	1
right	1
hand	1
swiftly,	1
he	1
flung	1
a	1
ball	1
of	1
paper	1
in	1
Syme's	1
face	1
and	1
vanished.	1
Syme	1
caught	1
the	1
thing	1
while	1
instinctively	1
warding	1
it	1
off,	1
and	1
discovered	1
that	1
it	1
consisted	1
of	1
two	1
crumpled	1
papers.	1
One	1
was	1
addressed	1
to	1
himself,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
to	1
Dr.	1
Bull,	1
with	1
a	1
very	1
long,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
feared	1
partly	1
ironical,	1
string	1
of	1
letters	1
after	1
his	1
name.	1
Dr.	1
Bull's	1
address	1
was,	1
at	1
any	1
rate,	1
considerably	1
longer	1
than	1
his	1
communication,	1
for	1
the	1
communication	1
consisted	1
entirely	1
of	1
the	1
words:--	1
"What	1
about	1
Martin	1
Tupper	1
now?"	1
"What	1
does	1
the	1
old	1
maniac	1
mean?"	1
asked	1
Bull,	1
staring	1
at	1
the	1
words.	1
"What	1
does	1
yours	1
say,	1
Syme?"	1
Syme's	1
message	1
was,	1
at	1
any	1
rate,	1
longer,	1
and	1
ran	1
as	1
follows:--	1
"No	1
one	1
would	1
regret	1
anything	1
in	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
an	1
interference	1
by	1
the	1
Archdeacon	1
more	1
than	1
I.	1
I	1
trust	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
come	1
to	1
that.	1
But,	1
for	1
the	1
last	1
time,	1
where	1
are	1
your	1
goloshes?	1
The	1
thing	1
is	1
too	1
bad,	1
especially	1
after	1
what	1
uncle	1
said."	1
The	1
President's	1
cabman	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
regaining	1
some	1
control	1
over	1
his	1
horse,	1
and	1
the	1
pursuers	1
gained	1
a	1
little	1
as	1
they	1
swept	1
round	1
into	1
the	1
Edgware	1
Road.	1
And	1
here	1
there	1
occurred	1
what	1
seemed	1
to	1
the	1
allies	1
a	1
providential	1
stoppage.	1
Traffic	1
of	1
every	1
kind	1
was	1
swerving	1
to	1
right	1
or	1
left	1
or	1
stopping,	1
for	1
down	1
the	1
long	1
road	1
was	1
coming	1
the	1
unmistakable	1
roar	1
announcing	1
the	1
fire-engine,	1
which	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
seconds	1
went	1
by	1
like	1
a	1
brazen	1
thunderbolt.	1
But	1
quick	1
as	1
it	1
went	1
by,	1
Sunday	1
had	1
bounded	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
cab,	1
sprung	1
at	1
the	1
fire-engine,	1
caught	1
it,	1
slung	1
himself	1
on	1
to	1
it,	1
and	1
was	1
seen	1
as	1
he	1
disappeared	1
in	1
the	1
noisy	1
distance	1
talking	1
to	1
the	1
astonished	1
fireman	1
with	1
explanatory	1
gestures.	1
"After	1
him!"	1
howled	1
Syme.	1
"He	1
can't	1
go	1
astray	1
now.	1
There's	1
no	1
mistaking	1
a	1
fire-engine."	1
The	1
three	1
cabmen,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
stunned	1
for	1
a	1
moment,	1
whipped	1
up	1
their	1
horses	1
and	1
slightly	1
decreased	1
the	1
distance	1
between	1
themselves	1
and	1
their	1
disappearing	1
prey.	1
The	1
President	1
acknowledged	1
this	1
proximity	1
by	1
coming	1
to	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
the	1
car,	1
bowing	1
repeatedly,	1
kissing	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
finally	1
flinging	1
a	1
neatly-folded	1
note	1
into	1
the	1
bosom	1
of	1
Inspector	1
Ratcliffe.	1
When	1
that	1
gentleman	1
opened	1
it,	1
not	1
without	1
impatience,	1
he	1
found	1
it	1
contained	1
the	1
words:--	1
"Fly	1
at	1
once.	1
The	1
truth	1
about	1
your	1
trouser-stretchers	1
is	1
known.	1
--A	1
FRIEND."	1
The	1
fire-engine	1
had	1
struck	1
still	1
farther	1
to	1
the	1
north,	1
into	1
a	1
region	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
recognise;	1
and	1
as	1
it	1
ran	1
by	1
a	1
line	1
of	1
high	1
railings	1
shadowed	1
with	1
trees,	1
the	1
six	1
friends	1
were	1
startled,	1
but	1
somewhat	1
relieved,	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
President	1
leap	1
from	1
the	1
fire-engine,	1
though	1
whether	1
through	1
another	1
whim	1
or	1
the	1
increasing	1
protest	1
of	1
his	1
entertainers	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
see.	1
Before	1
the	1
three	1
cabs,	1
however,	1
could	1
reach	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
spot,	1
he	1
had	1
gone	1
up	1
the	1
high	1
railings	1
like	1
a	1
huge	1
grey	1
cat,	1
tossed	1
himself	1
over,	1
and	1
vanished	1
in	1
a	1
darkness	1
of	1
leaves.	1
Syme	1
with	1
a	1
furious	1
gesture	1
stopped	1
his	1
cab,	1
jumped	1
out,	1
and	1
sprang	1
also	1
to	1
the	1
escalade.	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
one	1
leg	1
over	1
the	1
fence	1
and	1
his	1
friends	1
were	1
following,	1
he	1
turned	1
a	1
face	1
on	1
them	1
which	1
shone	1
quite	1
pale	1
in	1
the	1
shadow.	1
"What	1
place	1
can	1
this	1
be?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
"Can	1
it	1
be	1
the	1
old	1
devil's	1
house?	1
I've	1
heard	1
he	1
has	1
a	1
house	1
in	1
North	1
London."	1
"All	1
the	1
better,"	1
said	1
the	1
Secretary	1
grimly,	1
planting	1
a	1
foot	1
in	1
a	1
foothold,	1
"we	1
shall	1
find	1
him	1
at	1
home."	1
"No,	1
but	1
it	1
isn't	1
that,"	1
said	1
Syme,	1
knitting	1
his	1
brows.	1
"I	1
hear	1
the	1
most	1
horrible	1
noises,	1
like	1
devils	1
laughing	1
and	1
sneezing	1
and	1
blowing	1
their	1
devilish	1
noses!"	1
"His	1
dogs	1
barking,	1
of	1
course,"	1
said	1
the	1
Secretary.	1
"Why	1
not	1
say	1
his	1
black-beetles	1
barking!"	1
said	1
Syme	1
furiously,	1
"snails	1
barking!	1
geraniums	1
barking!	1
Did	1
you	1
ever	1
hear	1
a	1
dog	1
bark	1
like	1
that?"	1
He	1
held	1
up	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
there	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
thicket	1
a	1
long	1
growling	1
roar	1
that	1
seemed	1
to	1
get	1
under	1
the	1
skin	1
and	1
freeze	1
the	1
flesh--a	1
low	1
thrilling	1
roar	1
that	1
made	1
a	1
throbbing	1
in	1
the	1
air	1
all	1
about	1
them.	1
"The	1
dogs	1
of	1
Sunday	1
would	1
be	1
no	1
ordinary	1
dogs,"	1
said	1
Gogol,	1
and	1
shuddered.	1
Syme	1
had	1
jumped	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side,	1
but	1
he	1
still	1
stood	1
listening	1
impatiently.	1
"Well,	1
listen	1
to	1
that,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"is	1
that	1
a	1
dog--anybody's	1
dog?"	1
There	1
broke	1
upon	1
their	1
ear	1
a	1
hoarse	1
screaming	1
as	1
of	1
things	1
protesting	1
and	1
clamouring	1
in	1
sudden	1
pain;	1
and	1
then,	1
far	1
off	1
like	1
an	1
echo,	1
what	1
sounded	1
like	1
a	1
long	1
nasal	1
trumpet.	1
"Well,	1
his	1
house	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
hell!"	1
said	1
the	1
Secretary;	1
"and	1
if	1
it	1
is	1
hell,	1
I'm	1
going	1
in!"	1
and	1
he	1
sprang	1
over	1
the	1
tall	1
railings	1
almost	1
with	1
one	1
swing.	1
The	1
others	1
followed.	1
They	1
broke	1
through	1
a	1
tangle	1
of	1
plants	1
and	1
shrubs,	1
and	1
came	1
out	1
on	1
an	1
open	1
path.	1
Nothing	1
was	1
in	1
sight,	1
but	1
Dr.	1
Bull	1
suddenly	1
struck	1
his	1
hands	1
together.	1
"Why,	1
you	1
asses,"	1
he	1
cried,	1
"it's	1
the	1
Zoo!"	1
As	1
they	1
were	1
looking	1
round	1
wildly	1
for	1
any	1
trace	1
of	1
their	1
wild	1
quarry,	1
a	1
keeper	1
in	1
uniform	1
came	1
running	1
along	1
the	1
path	1
with	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
plain	1
clothes.	1
"Has	1
it	1
come	1
this	1
way?"	1
gasped	1
the	1
keeper.	1
"Has	1
what?"	1
asked	1
Syme.	1
"The	1
elephant!"	1
cried	1
the	1
keeper.	1
"An	1
elephant	1
has	1
gone	1
mad	1
and	1
run	1
away!"	1
"He	1
has	1
run	1
away	1
with	1
an	1
old	1
gentleman,"	1
said	1
the	1
other	1
stranger	1
breathlessly,	1
"a	1
poor	1
old	1
gentleman	1
with	1
white	1
hair!	1
"	1
"What	1
sort	1
of	1
old	1
gentleman?"	1
asked	1
Syme,	1
with	1
great	1
curiosity.	1
"A	1
very	1
large	1
and	1
fat	1
old	1
gentleman	1
in	1
light	1
grey	1
clothes,"	1
said	1
the	1
keeper	1
eagerly.	1
"Well,"	1
said	1
Syme,	1
"if	1
he's	1
that	1
particular	1
kind	1
of	1
old	1
gentleman,	1
if	1
you're	1
quite	1
sure	1
that	1
he's	1
a	1
large	1
and	1
fat	1
old	1
gentleman	1
in	1
grey	1
clothes,	1
you	1
may	1
take	1
my	1
word	1
for	1
it	1
that	1
the	1
elephant	1
has	1
not	1
run	1
away	1
with	1
him.	1
He	1
has	1
run	1
away	1
with	1
the	1
elephant.	1
The	1
elephant	1
is	1
not	1
made	1
by	1
God	1
that	1
could	1
run	1
away	1
with	1
him	1
if	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
consent	1
to	1
the	1
elopement.	1
And,	1
by	1
thunder,	1
there	1
he	1
is!"	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
doubt	1
about	1
it	1
this	1
time.	1
Clean	1
across	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
grass,	1
about	1
two	1
hundred	1
yards	1
away,	1
with	1
a	1
crowd	1
screaming	1
and	1
scampering	1
vainly	1
at	1
his	1
heels,	1
went	1
a	1
huge	1
grey	1
elephant	1
at	1
an	1
awful	1
stride,	1
with	1
his	1
trunk	1
thrown	1
out	1
as	1
rigid	1
as	1
a	1
ship's	1
bowsprit,	1
and	1
trumpeting	1
like	1
the	1
trumpet	1
of	1
doom.	1
On	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
the	1
bellowing	1
and	1
plunging	1
animal	1
sat	1
President	1
Sunday	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
placidity	1
of	1
a	1
sultan,	1
but	1
goading	1
the	1
animal	1
to	1
a	1
furious	1
speed	1
with	1
some	1
sharp	1
object	1
in	1
his	1
hand.	1
"Stop	1
him!"	1
screamed	1
the	1
populace.	1
"He'll	1
be	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
gate!"	1
"Stop	1
a	1
landslide!"	1
said	1
the	1
keeper.	1
"He	1
is	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
gate!"	1
And	1
even	1
as	1
he	1
spoke,	1
a	1
final	1
crash	1
and	1
roar	1
of	1
terror	1
announced	1
that	1
the	1
great	1
grey	1
elephant	1
had	1
broken	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
the	1
Zoological	1
Gardens,	1
and	1
was	1
careening	1
down	1
Albany	1
Street	1
like	1
a	1
new	1
and	1
swift	1
sort	1
of	1
omnibus.	1
"Great	1
Lord!"	1
cried	1
Bull,	1
"I	1
never	1
knew	1
an	1
elephant	1
could	1
go	1
so	1
fast.	1
Well,	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
hansom-cabs	1
again	1
if	1
we	1
are	1
to	1
keep	1
him	1
in	1
sight."	1
As	1
they	1
raced	1
along	1
to	1
the	1
gate	1
out	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
elephant	1
had	1
vanished,	1
Syme	1
felt	1
a	1
glaring	1
panorama	1
of	1
the	1
strange	1
animals	1
in	1
the	1
cages	1
which	1
they	1
passed.	1
Afterwards	1
he	1
thought	1
it	1
queer	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
have	1
seen	1
them	1
so	1
clearly.	1
He	1
remembered	1
especially	1
seeing	1
pelicans,	1
with	1
their	1
preposterous,	1
pendant	1
throats.	1
He	1
wondered	1
why	1
the	1
pelican	1
was	1
the	1
symbol	1
of	1
charity,	1
except	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
it	1
wanted	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
of	1
charity	1
to	1
admire	1
a	1
pelican.	1
He	1
remembered	1
a	1
hornbill,	1
which	1
was	1
simply	1
a	1
huge	1
yellow	1
beak	1
with	1
a	1
small	1
bird	1
tied	1
on	1
behind	1
it.	1
The	1
whole	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
sensation,	1
the	1
vividness	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
explain,	1
that	1
Nature	1
was	1
always	1
making	1
quite	1
mysterious	1
jokes.	1
Sunday	1
had	1
told	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
understand	1
him	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
understood	1
the	1
stars.	1
He	1
wondered	1
whether	1
even	1
the	1
archangels	1
understood	1
the	1
hornbill.	1
The	1
six	1
unhappy	1
detectives	1
flung	1
themselves	1
into	1
cabs	1
and	1
followed	1
the	1
elephant	1
sharing	1
the	1
terror	1
which	1
he	1
spread	1
through	1
the	1
long	1
stretch	1
of	1
the	1
streets.	1
This	1
time	1
Sunday	1
did	1
not	1
turn	1
round,	1
but	1
offered	1
them	1
the	1
solid	1
stretch	1
of	1
his	1
unconscious	1
back,	1
which	1
maddened	1
them,	1
if	1
possible,	1
more	1
than	1
his	1
previous	1
mockeries.	1
Just	1
before	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
Baker	1
Street,	1
however,	1
he	1
was	1
seen	1
to	1
throw	1
something	1
far	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
air,	1
as	1
a	1
boy	1
does	1
a	1
ball	1
meaning	1
to	1
catch	1
it	1
again.	1
But	1
at	1
their	1
rate	1
of	1
racing	1
it	1
fell	1
far	1
behind,	1
just	1
by	1
the	1
cab	1
containing	1
Gogol;	1
and	1
in	1
faint	1
hope	1
of	1
a	1
clue	1
or	1
for	1
some	1
impulse	1
unexplainable,	1
he	1
stopped	1
his	1
cab	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
pick	1
it	1
up.	1
It	1
was	1
addressed	1
to	1
himself,	1
and	1
was	1
quite	1
a	1
bulky	1
parcel.	1
On	1
examination,	1
however,	1
its	1
bulk	1
was	1
found	1
to	1
consist	1
of	1
thirty-three	1
pieces	1
of	1
paper	1
of	1
no	1
value	1
wrapped	1
one	1
round	1
the	1
other.	1
When	1
the	1
last	1
covering	1
was	1
torn	1
away	1
it	1
reduced	1
itself	1
to	1
a	1
small	1
slip	1
of	1
paper,	1
on	1
which	1
was	1
written:--	1
"The	1
word,	1
I	1
fancy,	1
should	1
be	1
'pink'."	1
The	1
man	1
once	1
known	1
as	1
Gogol	1
said	1
nothing,	1
but	1
the	1
movements	1
of	1
his	1
hands	1
and	1
feet	1
were	1
like	1
those	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
urging	1
a	1
horse	1
to	1
renewed	1
efforts.	1
Through	1
street	1
after	1
street,	1
through	1
district	1
after	1
district,	1
went	1
the	1
prodigy	1
of	1
the	1
flying	1
elephant,	1
calling	1
crowds	1
to	1
every	1
window,	1
and	1
driving	1
the	1
traffic	1
left	1
and	1
right.	1
And	1
still	1
through	1
all	1
this	1
insane	1
publicity	1
the	1
three	1
cabs	1
toiled	1
after	1
it,	1
until	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
be	1
regarded	1
as	1
part	1
of	1
a	1
procession,	1
and	1
perhaps	1
the	1
advertisement	1
of	1
a	1
circus.	1
They	1
went	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
rate	1
that	1
distances	1
were	1
shortened	1
beyond	1
belief,	1
and	1
Syme	1
saw	1
the	1
Albert	1
Hall	1
in	1
Kensington	1
when	1
he	1
thought	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
still	1
in	1
Paddington.	1
The	1
animal's	1
pace	1
was	1
even	1
more	1
fast	1
and	1
free	1
through	1
the	1
empty,	1
aristocratic	1
streets	1
of	1
South	1
Kensington,	1
and	1
he	1
finally	1
headed	1
towards	1
that	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
sky-line	1
where	1
the	1
enormous	1
Wheel	1
of	1
Earl's	1
Court	1
stood	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
sky.	1
The	1
wheel	1
grew	1
larger	1
and	1
larger,	1
till	1
it	1
filled	1
heaven	1
like	1
the	1
wheel	1
of	1
stars.	1
The	1
beast	1
outstripped	1
the	1
cabs.	1
They	1
lost	1
him	1
round	1
several	1
corners,	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
the	1
Earl's	1
Court	1
Exhibition	1
they	1
found	1
themselves	1
finally	1
blocked.	1
In	1
front	1
of	1
them	1
was	1
an	1
enormous	1
crowd;	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
it	1
was	1
an	1
enormous	1
elephant,	1
heaving	1
and	1
shuddering	1
as	1
such	1
shapeless	1
creatures	1
do.	1
But	1
the	1
President	1
had	1
disappeared.	1
"Where	1
has	1
he	1
gone	1
to?"	1
asked	1
Syme,	1
slipping	1
to	1
the	1
ground.	1
"Gentleman	1
rushed	1
into	1
the	1
Exhibition,	1
sir!"	1
said	1
an	1
official	1
in	1
a	1
dazed	1
manner.	1
Then	1
he	1
added	1
in	1
an	1
injured	1
voice:	1
"Funny	1
gentleman,	1
sir.	1
Asked	1
me	1
to	1
hold	1
his	1
horse,	1
and	1
gave	1
me	1
this."	1
He	1
held	1
out	1
with	1
distaste	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
folded	1
paper,	1
addressed:	1
"To	1
the	1
Secretary	1
of	1
the	1
Central	1
Anarchist	1
Council."	1
The	1
Secretary,	1
raging,	1
rent	1
it	1
open,	1
and	1
found	1
written	1
inside	1
it:--	1
"When	1
the	1
herring	1
runs	1
a	1
mile,	1
Let	1
the	1
Secretary	1
smile;	1
When	1
the	1
herring	1
tries	1
to	1
fly,	1
Let	1
the	1
Secretary	1
die.	1
Rustic	1
Proverb."	1
"Why	1
the	1
eternal	1
crikey,"	1
began	1
the	1
Secretary,	1
"did	1
you	1
let	1
the	1
man	1
in?	1
Do	1
people	1
commonly	1
come	1
to	1
you	1
Exhibition	1
riding	1
on	1
mad	1
elephants?	1
Do--"	1
"Look!"	1
shouted	1
Syme	1
suddenly.	1
"Look	1
over	1
there!"	1
"Look	1
at	1
what?"	1
asked	1
the	1
Secretary	1
savagely.	1
"Look	1
at	1
the	1
captive	1
balloon!"	1
said	1
Syme,	1
and	1
pointed	1
in	1
a	1
frenzy.	1
"Why	1
the	1
blazes	1
should	1
I	1
look	1
at	1
a	1
captive	1
balloon?'	1
demanded	1
the	1
Secretary.	1
"What	1
is	1
there	1
queer	1
about	1
a	1
captive	1
balloon?"	1
"Nothing,"	1
said	1
Syme,	1
"except	1
that	1
it	1
isn't	1
captive!'	1
They	1
all	1
turned	1
their	1
eyes	1
to	1
where	1
the	1
balloon	1
swung	1
and	1
swelled	1
above	1
the	1
Exhibition	1
on	1
a	1
string,	1
like	1
a	1
child's	1
balloon.	1
A	1
second	1
afterwards	1
the	1
string	1
came	1
in	1
two	1
just	1
under	1
the	1
car,	1
and	1
the	1
balloon,	1
broken	1
loose,	1
floated	1
away	1
with	1
the	1
freedom	1
of	1
a	1
soap	1
bubble.	1
"Ten	1
thousand	1
devils!"	1
shrieked	1
the	1
Secretary.	1
"He's	1
got	1
into	1
it!"	1
and	1
he	1
shook	1
his	1
fists	1
at	1
the	1
sky.	1
The	1
balloon,	1
borne	1
by	1
some	1
chance	1
wind,	1
came	1
right	1
above	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
could	1
see	1
the	1
great	1
white	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
President	1
peering	1
over	1
the	1
side	1
and	1
looking	1
benevolently	1
down	1
on	1
them.	1
"God	1
bless	1
my	1
soul!"	1
said	1
the	1
Professor	1
with	1
the	1
elderly	1
manner	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
never	1
disconnect	1
from	1
his	1
bleached	1
beard	1
and	1
parchment	1
face.	1
"God	1
bless	1
my	1
soul!	1
I	1
seemed	1
to	1
fancy	1
that	1
something	1
fell	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
my	1
hat!"	1
He	1
put	1
up	1
a	1
trembling	1
hand	1
and	1
took	1
from	1
that	1
shelf	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
twisted	1
paper,	1
which	1
he	1
opened	1
absently	1
only	1
to	1
find	1
it	1
inscribed	1
with	1
a	1
true	1
lover's	1
knot	1
and,	1
the	1
words:--	1
"Your	1
beauty	1
has	1
not	1
left	1
me	1
indifferent.--From	1
LITTLE	1
SNOWDROP.	1
"	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
short	1
silence,	1
and	1
then	1
Syme	1
said,	1
biting	1
his	1
beard--	1
"I'm	1
not	1
beaten	1
yet.	1
The	1
blasted	1
thing	1
must	1
come	1
down	1
somewhere.	1
Let's	1
follow	1
it!"	1
CHAPTER	1
XIV	1
THE	1
SIX	1
PHILOSOPHERS	1
ACROSS	1
green	1
fields,	1
and	1
breaking	1
through	1
blooming	1
hedges,	1
toiled	1
six	1
draggled	1
detectives,	1
about	1
five	1
miles	1
out	1
of	1
London.	1
The	1
optimist	1
of	1
the	1
party	1
had	1
at	1
first	1
proposed	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
follow	1
the	1
balloon	1
across	1
South	1
England	1
in	1
hansom-cabs.	1
But	1
he	1
was	1
ultimately	1
convinced	1
of	1
the	1
persistent	1
refusal	1
of	1
the	1
balloon	1
to	1
follow	1
the	1
roads,	1
and	1
the	1
still	1
more	1
persistent	1
refusal	1
of	1
the	1
cabmen	1
to	1
follow	1
the	1
balloon.	1
Consequently	1
the	1
tireless	1
though	1
exasperated	1
travellers	1
broke	1
through	1
black	1
thickets	1
and	1
ploughed	1
through	1
ploughed	1
fields	1
till	1
each	1
was	1
turned	1
into	1
a	1
figure	1
too	1
outrageous	1
to	1
be	1
mistaken	1
for	1
a	1
tramp.	1
Those	1
green	1
hills	1
of	1
Surrey	1
saw	1
the	1
final	1
collapse	1
and	1
tragedy	1
of	1
the	1
admirable	1
light	1
grey	1
suit	1
in	1
which	1
Syme	1
had	1
set	1
out	1
from	1
Saffron	1
Park.	1
His	1
silk	1
hat	1
was	1
broken	1
over	1
his	1
nose	1
by	1
a	1
swinging	1
bough,	1
his	1
coat-tails	1
were	1
torn	1
to	1
the	1
shoulder	1
by	1
arresting	1
thorns,	1
the	1
clay	1
of	1
England	1
was	1
splashed	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
collar;	1
but	1
he	1
still	1
carried	1
his	1
yellow	1
beard	1
forward	1
with	1
a	1
silent	1
and	1
furious	1
determination,	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
were	1
still	1
fixed	1
on	1
that	1
floating	1
ball	1
of	1
gas,	1
which	1
in	1
the	1
full	1
flush	1
of	1
sunset	1
seemed	1
coloured	1
like	1
a	1
sunset	1
cloud.	1
"After	1
all,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"it	1
is	1
very	1
beautiful!"	1
"It	1
is	1
singularly	1
and	1
strangely	1
beautiful!"	1
said	1
the	1
Professor.	1
"I	1
wish	1
the	1
beastly	1
gas-bag	1
would	1
burst!"	1
"No,"	1
said	1
Dr.	1
Bull,	1
"I	1
hope	1
it	1
won't.	1
It	1
might	1
hurt	1
the	1
old	1
boy."	1
"Hurt	1
him!"	1
said	1
the	1
vindictive	1
Professor,	1
"hurt	1
him!	1
Not	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
I'd	1
hurt	1
him	1
if	1
I	1
could	1
get	1
up	1
with	1
him.	1
Little	1
Snowdrop!"	1
"I	1
don't	1
want	1
him	1
hurt,	1
somehow,"	1
said	1
Dr.	1
Bull.	1
"What!"	1
cried	1
the	1
Secretary	1
bitterly.	1
"Do	1
you	1
believe	1
all	1
that	1
tale	1
about	1
his	1
being	1
our	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
dark	1
room?	1
Sunday	1
would	1
say	1
he	1
was	1
anybody."	1
"I	1
don't	1
know	1
whether	1
I	1
believe	1
it	1
or	1
not,"	1
said	1
Dr.	1
Bull.	1
"But	1
it	1
isn't	1
that	1
that	1
I	1
mean.	1
I	1
can't	1
wish	1
old	1
Sunday's	1
balloon	1
to	1
burst	1
because--"	1
"Well,"	1
said	1
Syme	1
impatiently,	1
"because?"	1
"Well,	1
because	1
he's	1
so	1
jolly	1
like	1
a	1
balloon	1
himself,"	1
said	1
Dr.	1
Bull	1
desperately.	1
"I	1
don't	1
understand	1
a	1
word	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
idea	1
of	1
his	1
being	1
the	1
same	1
man	1
who	1
gave	1
us	1
all	1
our	1
blue	1
cards.	1
It	1
seems	1
to	1
make	1
everything	1
nonsense.	1
But	1
I	1
don't	1
care	1
who	1
knows	1
it,	1
I	1
always	1
had	1
a	1
sympathy	1
for	1
old	1
Sunday	1
himself,	1
wicked	1
as	1
he	1
was.	1
Just	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
bouncing	1
baby.	1
How	1
can	1
I	1
explain	1
what	1
my	1
queer	1
sympathy	1
was?	1
It	1
didn't	1
prevent	1
my	1
fighting	1
him	1
like	1
hell!	1
Shall	1
I	1
make	1
it	1
clear	1
if	1
I	1
say	1
that	1
I	1
liked	1
him	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
fat?"	1
"You	1
will	1
not,"	1
said	1
the	1
Secretary.	1
"I've	1
got	1
it	1
now,"	1
cried	1
Bull,	1
"it	1
was	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
fat	1
and	1
so	1
light.	1
Just	1
like	1
a	1
balloon.	1
We	1
always	1
think	1
of	1
fat	1
people	1
as	1
heavy,	1
but	1
he	1
could	1
have	1
danced	1
against	1
a	1
sylph.	1
I	1
see	1
now	1
what	1
I	1
mean.	1
Moderate	1
strength	1
is	1
shown	1
in	1
violence,	1
supreme	1
strength	1
is	1
shown	1
in	1
levity.	1
It	1
was	1
like	1
the	1
old	1
speculations--what	1
would	1
happen	1
if	1
an	1
elephant	1
could	1
leap	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
sky	1
like	1
a	1
grasshopper?"	1
"Our	1
elephant,"	1
said	1
Syme,	1
looking	1
upwards,	1
"has	1
leapt	1
into	1
the	1
sky	1
like	1
a	1
grasshopper."	1
"And	1
somehow,"	1
concluded	1
Bull,	1
"that's	1
why	1
I	1
can't	1
help	1
liking	1
old	1
Sunday.	1
No,	1
it's	1
not	1
an	1
admiration	1
of	1
force,	1
or	1
any	1
silly	1
thing	1
like	1
that.	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
gaiety	1
in	1
the	1
thing,	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
bursting	1
with	1
some	1
good	1
news.	1
Haven't	1
you	1
sometimes	1
felt	1
it	1
on	1
a	1
spring	1
day?	1
You	1
know	1
Nature	1
plays	1
tricks,	1
but	1
somehow	1
that	1
day	1
proves	1
they	1
are	1
good-natured	1
tricks.	1
I	1
never	1
read	1
the	1
Bible	1
myself,	1
but	1
that	1
part	1
they	1
laugh	1
at	1
is	1
literal	1
truth,	1
'Why	1
leap	1
ye,	1
ye	1
high	1
hills?'	1
The	1
hills	1
do	1
leap--at	1
least,	1
they	1
try	1
to.	1
.	1
.	1
.	1
Why	1
do	1
I	1
like	1
Sunday?	1
.	1
.	1
.	1
how	1
can	1
I	1
tell	1
you?	1
.	1
.	1
.	1
because	1
he's	1
such	1
a	1
Bounder."	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
long	1
silence,	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
Secretary	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
curious,	1
strained	1
voice--	1
"You	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
Sunday	1
at	1
all.	1
Perhaps	1
it	1
is	1
because	1
you	1
are	1
better	1
than	1
I,	1
and	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
hell.	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
fierce	1
fellow,	1
and	1
a	1
trifle	1
morbid	1
from	1
the	1
first.	1
The	1
man	1
who	1
sits	1
in	1
darkness,	1
and	1
who	1
chose	1
us	1
all,	1
chose	1
me	1
because	1
I	1
had	1
all	1
the	1
crazy	1
look	1
of	1
a	1
conspirator--because	1
my	1
smile	1
went	1
crooked,	1
and	1
my	1
eyes	1
were	1
gloomy,	1
even	1
when	1
I	1
smiled.	1
But	1
there	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
something	1
in	1
me	1
that	1
answered	1
to	1
the	1
nerves	1
in	1
all	1
these	1
anarchic	1
men.	1
For	1
when	1
I	1
first	1
saw	1
Sunday	1
he	1
expressed	1
to	1
me,	1
not	1
your	1
airy	1
vitality,	1
but	1
something	1
both	1
gross	1
and	1
sad	1
in	1
the	1
Nature	1
of	1
Things.	1
I	1
found	1
him	1
smoking	1
in	1
a	1
twilight	1
room,	1
a	1
room	1
with	1
brown	1
blind	1
down,	1
infinitely	1
more	1
depressing	1
than	1
the	1
genial	1
darkness	1
in	1
which	1
our	1
master	1
lives.	1
He	1
sat	1
there	1
on	1
a	1
bench,	1
a	1
huge	1
heap	1
of	1
a	1
man,	1
dark	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
shape.	1
He	1
listened	1
to	1
all	1
my	1
words	1
without	1
speaking	1
or	1
even	1
stirring.	1
I	1
poured	1
out	1
my	1
most	1
passionate	1
appeals,	1
and	1
asked	1
my	1
most	1
eloquent	1
questions.	1
Then,	1
after	1
a	1
long	1
silence,	1
the	1
Thing	1
began	1
to	1
shake,	1
and	1
I	1
thought	1
it	1
was	1
shaken	1
by	1
some	1
secret	1
malady.	1
It	1
shook	1
like	1
a	1
loathsome	1
and	1
living	1
jelly.	1
It	1
reminded	1
me	1
of	1
everything	1
I	1
had	1
ever	1
read	1
about	1
the	1
base	1
bodies	1
that	1
are	1
the	1
origin	1
of	1
life--the	1
deep	1
sea	1
lumps	1
and	1
protoplasm.	1
It	1
seemed	1
like	1
the	1
final	1
form	1
of	1
matter,	1
the	1
most	1
shapeless	1
and	1
the	1
most	1
shameful.	1
I	1
could	1
only	1
tell	1
myself,	1
from	1
its	1
shudderings,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
something	1
at	1
least	1
that	1
such	1
a	1
monster	1
could	1
be	1
miserable.	1
And	1
then	1
it	1
broke	1
upon	1
me	1
that	1
the	1
bestial	1
mountain	1
was	1
shaking	1
with	1
a	1
lonely	1
laughter,	1
and	1
the	1
laughter	1
was	1
at	1
me.	1
Do	1
you	1
ask	1
me	1
to	1
forgive	1
him	1
that?	1
It	1
is	1
no	1
small	1
thing	1
to	1
be	1
laughed	1
at	1
by	1
something	1
at	1
once	1
lower	1
and	1
stronger	1
than	1
oneself."	1
"Surely	1
you	1
fellows	1
are	1
exaggerating	1
wildly,"	1
cut	1
in	1
the	1
clear	1
voice	1
of	1
Inspector	1
Ratcliffe.	1
"President	1
Sunday	1
is	1
a	1
terrible	1
fellow	1
for	1
one's	1
intellect,	1
but	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
such	1
a	1
Barnum's	1
freak	1
physically	1
as	1
you	1
make	1
out.	1
He	1
received	1
me	1
in	1
an	1
ordinary	1
office,	1
in	1
a	1
grey	1
check	1
coat,	1
in	1
broad	1
daylight.	1
He	1
talked	1
to	1
me	1
in	1
an	1
ordinary	1
way.	1
But	1
I'll	1
tell	1
you	1
what	1
is	1
a	1
trifle	1
creepy	1
about	1
Sunday.	1
His	1
room	1
is	1
neat,	1
his	1
clothes	1
are	1
neat,	1
everything	1
seems	1
in	1
order;	1
but	1
he's	1
absent-minded.	1
Sometimes	1
his	1
great	1
bright	1
eyes	1
go	1
quite	1
blind.	1
For	1
hours	1
he	1
forgets	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
there.	1
Now	1
absent-mindedness	1
is	1
just	1
a	1
bit	1
too	1
awful	1
in	1
a	1
bad	1
man.	1
We	1
think	1
of	1
a	1
wicked	1
man	1
as	1
vigilant.	1
We	1
can't	1
think	1
of	1
a	1
wicked	1
man	1
who	1
is	1
honestly	1
and	1
sincerely	1
dreamy,	1
because	1
we	1
daren't	1
think	1
of	1
a	1
wicked	1
man	1
alone	1
with	1
himself.	1
An	1
absentminded	1
man	1
means	1
a	1
good-natured	1
man.	1
It	1
means	1
a	1
man	1
who,	1
if	1
he	1
happens	1
to	1
see	1
you,	1
will	1
apologise.	1
But	1
how	1
will	1
you	1
bear	1
an	1
absentminded	1
man	1
who,	1
if	1
he	1
happens	1
to	1
see	1
you,	1
will	1
kill	1
you?	1
That	1
is	1
what	1
tries	1
the	1
nerves,	1
abstraction	1
combined	1
with	1
cruelty.	1
Men	1
have	1
felt	1
it	1
sometimes	1
when	1
they	1
went	1
through	1
wild	1
forests,	1
and	1
felt	1
that	1
the	1
animals	1
there	1
were	1
at	1
once	1
innocent	1
and	1
pitiless.	1
They	1
might	1
ignore	1
or	1
slay.	1
How	1
would	1
you	1
like	1
to	1
pass	1
ten	1
mortal	1
hours	1
in	1
a	1
parlour	1
with	1
an	1
absent-minded	1
tiger?"	1
"And	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
of	1
Sunday,	1
Gogol?"	1
asked	1
Syme.	1
"I	1
don't	1
think	1
of	1
Sunday	1
on	1
principle,"	1
said	1
Gogol	1
simply,	1
"any	1
more	1
than	1
I	1
stare	1
at	1
the	1
sun	1
at	1
noonday."	1
"Well,	1
that	1
is	1
a	1
point	1
of	1
view,"	1
said	1
Syme	1
thoughtfully.	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
say,	1
Professor?"	1
The	1
Professor	1
was	1
walking	1
with	1
bent	1
head	1
and	1
trailing	1
stick,	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
answer	1
at	1
all.	1
"Wake	1
up,	1
Professor!"	1
said	1
Syme	1
genially.	1
"Tell	1
us	1
what	1
you	1
think	1
of	1
Sunday."	1
The	1
Professor	1
spoke	1
at	1
last	1
very	1
slowly.	1
"I	1
think	1
something,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"that	1
I	1
cannot	1
say	1
clearly.	1
Or,	1
rather,	1
I	1
think	1
something	1
that	1
I	1
cannot	1
even	1
think	1
clearly.	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
something	1
like	1
this.	1
My	1
early	1
life,	1
as	1
you	1
know,	1
was	1
a	1
bit	1
too	1
large	1
and	1
loose.	1
Well,	1
when	1
I	1
saw	1
Sunday's	1
face	1
I	1
thought	1
it	1
was	1
too	1
large--	1
everybody	1
does,	1
but	1
I	1
also	1
thought	1
it	1
was	1
too	1
loose.	1
The	1
face	1
was	1
so	1
big,	1
that	1
one	1
couldn't	1
focus	1
it	1
or	1
make	1
it	1
a	1
face	1
at	1
all.	1
The	1
eye	1
was	1
so	1
far	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
nose,	1
that	1
it	1
wasn't	1
an	1
eye.	1
The	1
mouth	1
was	1
so	1
much	1
by	1
itself,	1
that	1
one	1
had	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
it	1
by	1
itself.	1
The	1
whole	1
thing	1
is	1
too	1
hard	1
to	1
explain."	1
He	1
paused	1
for	1
a	1
little,	1
still	1
trailing	1
his	1
stick,	1
and	1
then	1
went	1
on--	1
"But	1
put	1
it	1
this	1
way.	1
Walking	1
up	1
a	1
road	1
at	1
night,	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
a	1
lamp	1
and	1
a	1
lighted	1
window	1
and	1
a	1
cloud	1
make	1
together	1
a	1
most	1
complete	1
and	1
unmistakable	1
face.	1
If	1
anyone	1
in	1
heaven	1
has	1
that	1
face	1
I	1
shall	1
know	1
him	1
again.	1
Yet	1
when	1
I	1
walked	1
a	1
little	1
farther	1
I	1
found	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
face,	1
that	1
the	1
window	1
was	1
ten	1
yards	1
away,	1
the	1
lamp	1
ten	1
hundred	1
yards,	1
the	1
cloud	1
beyond	1
the	1
world.	1
Well,	1
Sunday's	1
face	1
escaped	1
me;	1
it	1
ran	1
away	1
to	1
right	1
and	1
left,	1
as	1
such	1
chance	1
pictures	1
run	1
away.	1
And	1
so	1
his	1
face	1
has	1
made	1
me,	1
somehow,	1
doubt	1
whether	1
there	1
are	1
any	1
faces.	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
whether	1
your	1
face,	1
Bull,	1
is	1
a	1
face	1
or	1
a	1
combination	1
in	1
perspective.	1
Perhaps	1
one	1
black	1
disc	1
of	1
your	1
beastly	1
glasses	1
is	1
quite	1
close	1
and	1
another	1
fifty	1
miles	1
away.	1
Oh,	1
the	1
doubts	1
of	1
a	1
materialist	1
are	1
not	1
worth	1
a	1
dump.	1
Sunday	1
has	1
taught	1
me	1
the	1
last	1
and	1
the	1
worst	1
doubts,	1
the	1
doubts	1
of	1
a	1
spiritualist.	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
Buddhist,	1
I	1
suppose;	1
and	1
Buddhism	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
creed,	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
doubt.	1
My	1
poor	1
dear	1
Bull,	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
believe	1
that	1
you	1
really	1
have	1
a	1
face.	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
faith	1
enough	1
to	1
believe	1
in	1
matter."	1
Syme's	1
eyes	1
were	1
still	1
fixed	1
upon	1
the	1
errant	1
orb,	1
which,	1
reddened	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
light,	1
looked	1
like	1
some	1
rosier	1
and	1
more	1
innocent	1
world.	1
"Have	1
you	1
noticed	1
an	1
odd	1
thing,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"about	1
all	1
your	1
descriptions?	1
Each	1
man	1
of	1
you	1
finds	1
Sunday	1
quite	1
different,	1
yet	1
each	1
man	1
of	1
you	1
can	1
only	1
find	1
one	1
thing	1
to	1
compare	1
him	1
to--the	1
universe	1
itself.	1
Bull	1
finds	1
him	1
like	1
the	1
earth	1
in	1
spring,	1
Gogol	1
like	1
the	1
sun	1
at	1
noonday.	1
The	1
Secretary	1
is	1
reminded	1
of	1
the	1
shapeless	1
protoplasm,	1
and	1
the	1
Inspector	1
of	1
the	1
carelessness	1
of	1
virgin	1
forests.	1
The	1
Professor	1
says	1
he	1
is	1
like	1
a	1
changing	1
landscape.	1
This	1
is	1
queer,	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
queerer	1
still	1
that	1
I	1
also	1
have	1
had	1
my	1
odd	1
notion	1
about	1
the	1
President,	1
and	1
I	1
also	1
find	1
that	1
I	1
think	1
of	1
Sunday	1
as	1
I	1
think	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
world."	1
"Get	1
on	1
a	1
little	1
faster,	1
Syme,"	1
said	1
Bull;	1
"never	1
mind	1
the	1
balloon."	1
"When	1
I	1
first	1
saw	1
Sunday,"	1
said	1
Syme	1
slowly,	1
"I	1
only	1
saw	1
his	1
back;	1
and	1
when	1
I	1
saw	1
his	1
back,	1
I	1
knew	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
worst	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
His	1
neck	1
and	1
shoulders	1
were	1
brutal,	1
like	1
those	1
of	1
some	1
apish	1
god.	1
His	1
head	1
had	1
a	1
stoop	1
that	1
was	1
hardly	1
human,	1
like	1
the	1
stoop	1
of	1
an	1
ox.	1
In	1
fact,	1
I	1
had	1
at	1
once	1
the	1
revolting	1
fancy	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
man	1
at	1
all,	1
but	1
a	1
beast	1
dressed	1
up	1
in	1
men's	1
clothes."	1
"Get	1
on,"	1
said	1
Dr.	1
Bull.	1
"And	1
then	1
the	1
queer	1
thing	1
happened.	1
I	1
had	1
seen	1
his	1
back	1
from	1
the	1
street,	1
as	1
he	1
sat	1
in	1
the	1
balcony.	1
Then	1
I	1
entered	1
the	1
hotel,	1
and	1
coming	1
round	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
him,	1
saw	1
his	1
face	1
in	1
the	1
sunlight.	1
His	1
face	1
frightened	1
me,	1
as	1
it	1
did	1
everyone;	1
but	1
not	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
brutal,	1
not	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
evil.	1
On	1
the	1
contrary,	1
it	1
frightened	1
me	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
beautiful,	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
good."	1
"Syme,"	1
exclaimed	1
the	1
Secretary,	1
"are	1
you	1
ill?"	1
"It	1
was	1
like	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
some	1
ancient	1
archangel,	1
judging	1
justly	1
after	1
heroic	1
wars.	1
There	1
was	1
laughter	1
in	1
the	1
eyes,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
mouth	1
honour	1
and	1
sorrow.	1
There	1
was	1
the	1
same	1
white	1
hair,	1
the	1
same	1
great,	1
grey-clad	1
shoulders	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
seen	1
from	1
behind.	1
But	1
when	1
I	1
saw	1
him	1
from	1
behind	1
I	1
was	1
certain	1
he	1
was	1
an	1
animal,	1
and	1
when	1
I	1
saw	1
him	1
in	1
front	1
I	1
knew	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
god."	1
"Pan,"	1
said	1
the	1
Professor	1
dreamily,	1
"was	1
a	1
god	1
and	1
an	1
animal."	1
"Then,	1
and	1
again	1
and	1
always,"	1
went	1
on	1
Syme	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
talking	1
to	1
himself,	1
"that	1
has	1
been	1
for	1
me	1
the	1
mystery	1
of	1
Sunday,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
also	1
the	1
mystery	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
When	1
I	1
see	1
the	1
horrible	1
back,	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
the	1
noble	1
face	1
is	1
but	1
a	1
mask.	1
When	1
I	1
see	1
the	1
face	1
but	1
for	1
an	1
instant,	1
I	1
know	1
the	1
back	1
is	1
only	1
a	1
jest.	1
Bad	1
is	1
so	1
bad,	1
that	1
we	1
cannot	1
but	1
think	1
good	1
an	1
accident;	1
good	1
is	1
so	1
good,	1
that	1
we	1
feel	1
certain	1
that	1
evil	1
could	1
be	1
explained.	1
But	1
the	1
whole	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
crest	1
yesterday	1
when	1
I	1
raced	1
Sunday	1
for	1
the	1
cab,	1
and	1
was	1
just	1
behind	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
way."	1
"Had	1
you	1
time	1
for	1
thinking	1
then?"	1
asked	1
Ratcliffe.	1
"Time,"	1
replied	1
Syme,	1
"for	1
one	1
outrageous	1
thought.	1
I	1
was	1
suddenly	1
possessed	1
with	1
the	1
idea	1
that	1
the	1
blind,	1
blank	1
back	1
of	1
his	1
head	1
really	1
was	1
his	1
face--an	1
awful,	1
eyeless	1
face	1
staring	1
at	1
me!	1
And	1
I	1
fancied	1
that	1
the	1
figure	1
running	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
me	1
was	1
really	1
a	1
figure	1
running	1
backwards,	1
and	1
dancing	1
as	1
he	1
ran."	1
"Horrible!"	1
said	1
Dr.	1
Bull,	1
and	1
shuddered.	1
"Horrible	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
word,"	1
said	1
Syme.	1
"It	1
was	1
exactly	1
the	1
worst	1
instant	1
of	1
my	1
life.	1
And	1
yet	1
ten	1
minutes	1
afterwards,	1
when	1
he	1
put	1
his	1
head	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
cab	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
grimace	1
like	1
a	1
gargoyle,	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
only	1
like	1
a	1
father	1
playing	1
hide-and-seek	1
with	1
his	1
children."	1
"It	1
is	1
a	1
long	1
game,"	1
said	1
the	1
Secretary,	1
and	1
frowned	1
at	1
his	1
broken	1
boots.	1
"Listen	1
to	1
me,"	1
cried	1
Syme	1
with	1
extraordinary	1
emphasis.	1
"Shall	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
the	1
secret	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
world?	1
It	1
is	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
only	1
known	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
We	1
see	1
everything	1
from	1
behind,	1
and	1
it	1
looks	1
brutal.	1
That	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
tree,	1
but	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
a	1
tree.	1
That	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
cloud,	1
but	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
a	1
cloud.	1
Cannot	1
you	1
see	1
that	1
everything	1
is	1
stooping	1
and	1
hiding	1
a	1
face?	1
If	1
we	1
could	1
only	1
get	1
round	1
in	1
front--"	1
"Look!"	1
cried	1
out	1
Bull	1
clamorously,	1
"the	1
balloon	1
is	1
coming	1
down!"	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
need	1
to	1
cry	1
out	1
to	1
Syme,	1
who	1
had	1
never	1
taken	1
his	1
eyes	1
off	1
it.	1
He	1
saw	1
the	1
great	1
luminous	1
globe	1
suddenly	1
stagger	1
in	1
the	1
sky,	1
right	1
itself,	1
and	1
then	1
sink	1
slowly	1
behind	1
the	1
trees	1
like	1
a	1
setting	1
sun.	1
The	1
man	1
called	1
Gogol,	1
who	1
had	1
hardly	1
spoken	1
through	1
all	1
their	1
weary	1
travels,	1
suddenly	1
threw	1
up	1
his	1
hands	1
like	1
a	1
lost	1
spirit.	1
"He	1
is	1
dead!"	1
he	1
cried.	1
"And	1
now	1
I	1
know	1
he	1
was	1
my	1
friend--my	1
friend	1
in	1
the	1
dark!"	1
"Dead!"	1
snorted	1
the	1
Secretary.	1
"You	1
will	1
not	1
find	1
him	1
dead	1
easily.	1
If	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
tipped	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
car,	1
we	1
shall	1
find	1
him	1
rolling	1
as	1
a	1
colt	1
rolls	1
in	1
a	1
field,	1
kicking	1
his	1
legs	1
for	1
fun."	1
"Clashing	1
his	1
hoofs,"	1
said	1
the	1
Professor.	1
"The	1
colts	1
do,	1
and	1
so	1
did	1
Pan."	1
"Pan	1
again!"	1
said	1
Dr.	1
Bull	1
irritably.	1
"You	1
seem	1
to	1
think	1
Pan	1
is	1
everything."	1
"So	1
he	1
is,"	1
said	1
the	1
Professor,	1
"in	1
Greek.	1
He	1
means	1
everything."	1
"Don't	1
forget,"	1
said	1
the	1
Secretary,	1
looking	1
down,	1
"that	1
he	1
also	1
means	1
Panic."	1
Syme	1
had	1
stood	1
without	1
hearing	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
exclamations.	1
"It	1
fell	1
over	1
there,"	1
he	1
said	1
shortly.	1
"Let	1
us	1
follow	1
it!"	1
Then	1
he	1
added	1
with	1
an	1
indescribable	1
gesture--	1
"Oh,	1
if	1
he	1
has	1
cheated	1
us	1
all	1
by	1
getting	1
killed!	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
like	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
larks."	1
He	1
strode	1
off	1
towards	1
the	1
distant	1
trees	1
with	1
a	1
new	1
energy,	1
his	1
rags	1
and	1
ribbons	1
fluttering	1
in	1
the	1
wind.	1
The	1
others	1
followed	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
more	1
footsore	1
and	1
dubious	1
manner.	1
And	1
almost	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
moment	1
all	1
six	1
men	1
realised	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
alone	1
in	1
the	1
little	1
field.	1
Across	1
the	1
square	1
of	1
turf	1
a	1
tall	1
man	1
was	1
advancing	1
towards	1
them,	1
leaning	1
on	1
a	1
strange	1
long	1
staff	1
like	1
a	1
sceptre.	1
He	1
was	1
clad	1
in	1
a	1
fine	1
but	1
old-fashioned	1
suit	1
with	1
knee-breeches;	1
its	1
colour	1
was	1
that	1
shade	1
between	1
blue,	1
violet	1
and	1
grey	1
which	1
can	1
be	1
seen	1
in	1
certain	1
shadows	1
of	1
the	1
woodland.	1
His	1
hair	1
was	1
whitish	1
grey,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
glance,	1
taken	1
along	1
with	1
his	1
knee-breeches,	1
looked	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
was	1
powdered.	1
His	1
advance	1
was	1
very	1
quiet;	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
silver	1
frost	1
upon	1
his	1
head,	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
one	1
to	1
the	1
shadows	1
of	1
the	1
wood.	1
"Gentlemen,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"my	1
master	1
has	1
a	1
carriage	1
waiting	1
for	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
road	1
just	1
by."	1
"Who	1
is	1
your	1
master?"	1
asked	1
Syme,	1
standing	1
quite	1
still.	1
"I	1
was	1
told	1
you	1
knew	1
his	1
name,"	1
said	1
the	1
man	1
respectfully.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
silence,	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
Secretary	1
said--	1
"Where	1
is	1
this	1
carriage?"	1
"It	1
has	1
been	1
waiting	1
only	1
a	1
few	1
moments,"	1
said	1
the	1
stranger.	1
"My	1
master	1
has	1
only	1
just	1
come	1
home."	1
Syme	1
looked	1
left	1
and	1
right	1
upon	1
the	1
patch	1
of	1
green	1
field	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
found	1
himself.	1
The	1
hedges	1
were	1
ordinary	1
hedges,	1
the	1
trees	1
seemed	1
ordinary	1
trees;	1
yet	1
he	1
felt	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
entrapped	1
in	1
fairyland.	1
He	1
looked	1
the	1
mysterious	1
ambassador	1
up	1
and	1
down,	1
but	1
he	1
could	1
discover	1
nothing	1
except	1
that	1
the	1
man's	1
coat	1
was	1
the	1
exact	1
colour	1
of	1
the	1
purple	1
shadows,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
man's	1
face	1
was	1
the	1
exact	1
colour	1
of	1
the	1
red	1
and	1
brown	1
and	1
golden	1
sky.	1
"Show	1
us	1
the	1
place,"	1
Syme	1
said	1
briefly,	1
and	1
without	1
a	1
word	1
the	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
violet	1
coat	1
turned	1
his	1
back	1
and	1
walked	1
towards	1
a	1
gap	1
in	1
the	1
hedge,	1
which	1
let	1
in	1
suddenly	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
a	1
white	1
road.	1
As	1
the	1
six	1
wanderers	1
broke	1
out	1
upon	1
this	1
thoroughfare,	1
they	1
saw	1
the	1
white	1
road	1
blocked	1
by	1
what	1
looked	1
like	1
a	1
long	1
row	1
of	1
carriages,	1
such	1
a	1
row	1
of	1
carriages	1
as	1
might	1
close	1
the	1
approach	1
to	1
some	1
house	1
in	1
Park	1
Lane.	1
Along	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
these	1
carriages	1
stood	1
a	1
rank	1
of	1
splendid	1
servants,	1
all	1
dressed	1
in	1
the	1
grey-blue	1
uniform,	1
and	1
all	1
having	1
a	1
certain	1
quality	1
of	1
stateliness	1
and	1
freedom	1
which	1
would	1
not	1
commonly	1
belong	1
to	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
a	1
gentleman,	1
but	1
rather	1
to	1
the	1
officials	1
and	1
ambassadors	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
king.	1
There	1
were	1
no	1
less	1
than	1
six	1
carriages	1
waiting,	1
one	1
for	1
each	1
of	1
the	1
tattered	1
and	1
miserable	1
band.	1
All	1
the	1
attendants	1
(as	1
if	1
in	1
court-dress)	1
wore	1
swords,	1
and	1
as	1
each	1
man	1
crawled	1
into	1
his	1
carriage	1
they	1
drew	1
them,	1
and	1
saluted	1
with	1
a	1
sudden	1
blaze	1
of	1
steel.	1
"What	1
can	1
it	1
all	1
mean?"	1
asked	1
Bull	1
of	1
Syme	1
as	1
they	1
separated.	1
"Is	1
this	1
another	1
joke	1
of	1
Sunday's?"	1
"I	1
don't	1
know,"	1
said	1
Syme	1
as	1
he	1
sank	1
wearily	1
back	1
in	1
the	1
cushions	1
of	1
his	1
carriage;	1
"but	1
if	1
it	1
is,	1
it's	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
jokes	1
you	1
talk	1
about.	1
It's	1
a	1
good-natured	1
one."	1
The	1
six	1
adventurers	1
had	1
passed	1
through	1
many	1
adventures,	1
but	1
not	1
one	1
had	1
carried	1
them	1
so	1
utterly	1
off	1
their	1
feet	1
as	1
this	1
last	1
adventure	1
of	1
comfort.	1
They	1
had	1
all	1
become	1
inured	1
to	1
things	1
going	1
roughly;	1
but	1
things	1
suddenly	1
going	1
smoothly	1
swamped	1
them.	1
They	1
could	1
not	1
even	1
feebly	1
imagine	1
what	1
the	1
carriages	1
were;	1
it	1
was	1
enough	1
for	1
them	1
to	1
know	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
carriages,	1
and	1
carriages	1
with	1
cushions.	1
They	1
could	1
not	1
conceive	1
who	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
was	1
who	1
had	1
led	1
them;	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
quite	1
enough	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
certainly	1
led	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
carriages.	1
Syme	1
drove	1
through	1
a	1
drifting	1
darkness	1
of	1
trees	1
in	1
utter	1
abandonment.	1
It	1
was	1
typical	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
while	1
he	1
had	1
carried	1
his	1
bearded	1
chin	1
forward	1
fiercely	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
anything	1
could	1
be	1
done,	1
when	1
the	1
whole	1
business	1
was	1
taken	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
hands	1
he	1
fell	1
back	1
on	1
the	1
cushions	1
in	1
a	1
frank	1
collapse.	1
Very	1
gradually	1
and	1
very	1
vaguely	1
he	1
realised	1
into	1
what	1
rich	1
roads	1
the	1
carriage	1
was	1
carrying	1
him.	1
He	1
saw	1
that	1
they	1
passed	1
the	1
stone	1
gates	1
of	1
what	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
park,	1
that	1
they	1
began	1
gradually	1
to	1
climb	1
a	1
hill	1
which,	1
while	1
wooded	1
on	1
both	1
sides,	1
was	1
somewhat	1
more	1
orderly	1
than	1
a	1
forest.	1
Then	1
there	1
began	1
to	1
grow	1
upon	1
him,	1
as	1
upon	1
a	1
man	1
slowly	1
waking	1
from	1
a	1
healthy	1
sleep,	1
a	1
pleasure	1
in	1
everything.	1
He	1
felt	1
that	1
the	1
hedges	1
were	1
what	1
hedges	1
should	1
be,	1
living	1
walls;	1
that	1
a	1
hedge	1
is	1
like	1
a	1
human	1
army,	1
disciplined,	1
but	1
all	1
the	1
more	1
alive.	1
He	1
saw	1
high	1
elms	1
behind	1
the	1
hedges,	1
and	1
vaguely	1
thought	1
how	1
happy	1
boys	1
would	1
be	1
climbing	1
there.	1
Then	1
his	1
carriage	1
took	1
a	1
turn	1
of	1
the	1
path,	1
and	1
he	1
saw	1
suddenly	1
and	1
quietly,	1
like	1
a	1
long,	1
low,	1
sunset	1
cloud,	1
a	1
long,	1
low	1
house,	1
mellow	1
in	1
the	1
mild	1
light	1
of	1
sunset.	1
All	1
the	1
six	1
friends	1
compared	1
notes	1
afterwards	1
and	1
quarrelled;	1
but	1
they	1
all	1
agreed	1
that	1
in	1
some	1
unaccountable	1
way	1
the	1
place	1
reminded	1
them	1
of	1
their	1
boyhood.	1
It	1
was	1
either	1
this	1
elm-top	1
or	1
that	1
crooked	1
path,	1
it	1
was	1
either	1
this	1
scrap	1
of	1
orchard	1
or	1
that	1
shape	1
of	1
a	1
window;	1
but	1
each	1
man	1
of	1
them	1
declared	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
remember	1
this	1
place	1
before	1
he	1
could	1
remember	1
his	1
mother.	1
When	1
the	1
carriages	1
eventually	1
rolled	1
up	1
to	1
a	1
large,	1
low,	1
cavernous	1
gateway,	1
another	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
uniform,	1
but	1
wearing	1
a	1
silver	1
star	1
on	1
the	1
grey	1
breast	1
of	1
his	1
coat,	1
came	1
out	1
to	1
meet	1
them.	1
This	1
impressive	1
person	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
bewildered	1
Syme--	1
"Refreshments	1
are	1
provided	1
for	1
you	1
in	1
your	1
room."	1
Syme,	1
under	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
mesmeric	1
sleep	1
of	1
amazement,	1
went	1
up	1
the	1
large	1
oaken	1
stairs	1
after	1
the	1
respectful	1
attendant.	1
He	1
entered	1
a	1
splendid	1
suite	1
of	1
apartments	1
that	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
designed	1
specially	1
for	1
him.	1
He	1
walked	1
up	1
to	1
a	1
long	1
mirror	1
with	1
the	1
ordinary	1
instinct	1
of	1
his	1
class,	1
to	1
pull	1
his	1
tie	1
straight	1
or	1
to	1
smooth	1
his	1
hair;	1
and	1
there	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
frightful	1
figure	1
that	1
he	1
was--blood	1
running	1
down	1
his	1
face	1
from	1
where	1
the	1
bough	1
had	1
struck	1
him,	1
his	1
hair	1
standing	1
out	1
like	1
yellow	1
rags	1
of	1
rank	1
grass,	1
his	1
clothes	1
torn	1
into	1
long,	1
wavering	1
tatters.	1
At	1
once	1
the	1
whole	1
enigma	1
sprang	1
up,	1
simply	1
as	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
got	1
there,	1
and	1
how	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
get	1
out	1
again.	1
Exactly	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
moment	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
blue,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
appointed	1
as	1
his	1
valet,	1
said	1
very	1
solemnly--	1
"I	1
have	1
put	1
out	1
your	1
clothes,	1
sir."	1
"Clothes!"	1
said	1
Syme	1
sardonically.	1
"I	1
have	1
no	1
clothes	1
except	1
these,"	1
and	1
he	1
lifted	1
two	1
long	1
strips	1
of	1
his	1
frock-coat	1
in	1
fascinating	1
festoons,	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
movement	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
twirl	1
like	1
a	1
ballet	1
girl.	1
"My	1
master	1
asks	1
me	1
to	1
say,"	1
said	1
the	1
attendant,	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
fancy	1
dress	1
ball	1
tonight,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
desires	1
you	1
to	1
put	1
on	1
the	1
costume	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
laid	1
out.	1
Meanwhile,	1
sir,	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
bottle	1
of	1
Burgundy	1
and	1
some	1
cold	1
pheasant,	1
which	1
he	1
hopes	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
refuse,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
some	1
hours	1
before	1
supper."	1
"Cold	1
pheasant	1
is	1
a	1
good	1
thing,"	1
said	1
Syme	1
reflectively,	1
"and	1
Burgundy	1
is	1
a	1
spanking	1
good	1
thing.	1
But	1
really	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
want	1
either	1
of	1
them	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
the	1
devil	1
all	1
this	1
means,	1
and	1
what	1
sort	1
of	1
costume	1
you	1
have	1
got	1
laid	1
out	1
for	1
me.	1
Where	1
is	1
it?"	1
The	1
servant	1
lifted	1
off	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
ottoman	1
a	1
long	1
peacock-blue	1
drapery,	1
rather	1
of	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
a	1
domino,	1
on	1
the	1
front	1
of	1
which	1
was	1
emblazoned	1
a	1
large	1
golden	1
sun,	1
and	1
which	1
was	1
splashed	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
with	1
flaming	1
stars	1
and	1
crescents.	1
"You're	1
to	1
be	1
dressed	1
as	1
Thursday,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
the	1
valet	1
somewhat	1
affably.	1
"Dressed	1
as	1
Thursday!"	1
said	1
Syme	1
in	1
meditation.	1
"It	1
doesn't	1
sound	1
a	1
warm	1
costume."	1
"Oh,	1
yes,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
the	1
other	1
eagerly,	1
"the	1
Thursday	1
costume	1
is	1
quite	1
warm,	1
sir.	1
It	1
fastens	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
chin."	1
"Well,	1
I	1
don't	1
understand	1
anything,"	1
said	1
Syme,	1
sighing.	1
"I	1
have	1
been	1
used	1
so	1
long	1
to	1
uncomfortable	1
adventures	1
that	1
comfortable	1
adventures	1
knock	1
me	1
out.	1
Still,	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
allowed	1
to	1
ask	1
why	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
particularly	1
like	1
Thursday	1
in	1
a	1
green	1
frock	1
spotted	1
all	1
over	1
with	1
the	1
sun	1
and	1
moon.	1
Those	1
orbs,	1
I	1
think,	1
shine	1
on	1
other	1
days.	1
I	1
once	1
saw	1
the	1
moon	1
on	1
Tuesday,	1
I	1
remember."	1
"Beg	1
pardon,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
the	1
valet,	1
"Bible	1
also	1
provided	1
for	1
you,"	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
respectful	1
and	1
rigid	1
finger	1
he	1
pointed	1
out	1
a	1
passage	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
chapter	1
of	1
Genesis.	1
Syme	1
read	1
it	1
wondering.	1
It	1
was	1
that	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
fourth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
week	1
is	1
associated	1
with	1
the	1
creation	1
of	1
the	1
sun	1
and	1
moon.	1
Here,	1
however,	1
they	1
reckoned	1
from	1
a	1
Christian	1
Sunday.	1
"This	1
is	1
getting	1
wilder	1
and	1
wilder,"	1
said	1
Syme,	1
as	1
he	1
sat	1
down	1
in	1
a	1
chair.	1
"Who	1
are	1
these	1
people	1
who	1
provide	1
cold	1
pheasant	1
and	1
Burgundy,	1
and	1
green	1
clothes	1
and	1
Bibles?	1
Do	1
they	1
provide	1
everything?"	1
"Yes,	1
sir,	1
everything,"	1
said	1
the	1
attendant	1
gravely.	1
"Shall	1
I	1
help	1
you	1
on	1
with	1
your	1
costume?"	1
"Oh,	1
hitch	1
the	1
bally	1
thing	1
on!"	1
said	1
Syme	1
impatiently.	1
But	1
though	1
he	1
affected	1
to	1
despise	1
the	1
mummery,	1
he	1
felt	1
a	1
curious	1
freedom	1
and	1
naturalness	1
in	1
his	1
movements	1
as	1
the	1
blue	1
and	1
gold	1
garment	1
fell	1
about	1
him;	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
found	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
wear	1
a	1
sword,	1
it	1
stirred	1
a	1
boyish	1
dream.	1
As	1
he	1
passed	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
he	1
flung	1
the	1
folds	1
across	1
his	1
shoulder	1
with	1
a	1
gesture,	1
his	1
sword	1
stood	1
out	1
at	1
an	1
angle,	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
all	1
the	1
swagger	1
of	1
a	1
troubadour.	1
For	1
these	1
disguises	1
did	1
not	1
disguise,	1
but	1
reveal.	1
CHAPTER	1
XV	1
THE	1
ACCUSER	1
AS	1
Syme	1
strode	1
along	1
the	1
corridor	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
Secretary	1
standing	1
at	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
flight	1
of	1
stairs.	1
The	1
man	1
had	1
never	1
looked	1
so	1
noble.	1
He	1
was	1
draped	1
in	1
a	1
long	1
robe	1
of	1
starless	1
black,	1
down	1
the	1
centre	1
of	1
which	1
fell	1
a	1
band	1
or	1
broad	1
stripe	1
of	1
pure	1
white,	1
like	1
a	1
single	1
shaft	1
of	1
light.	1
The	1
whole	1
looked	1
like	1
some	1
very	1
severe	1
ecclesiastical	1
vestment.	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
need	1
for	1
Syme	1
to	1
search	1
his	1
memory	1
or	1
the	1
Bible	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
remember	1
that	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
of	1
creation	1
marked	1
the	1
mere	1
creation	1
of	1
light	1
out	1
of	1
darkness.	1
The	1
vestment	1
itself	1
would	1
alone	1
have	1
suggested	1
the	1
symbol;	1
and	1
Syme	1
felt	1
also	1
how	1
perfectly	1
this	1
pattern	1
of	1
pure	1
white	1
and	1
black	1
expressed	1
the	1
soul	1
of	1
the	1
pale	1
and	1
austere	1
Secretary,	1
with	1
his	1
inhuman	1
veracity	1
and	1
his	1
cold	1
frenzy,	1
which	1
made	1
him	1
so	1
easily	1
make	1
war	1
on	1
the	1
anarchists,	1
and	1
yet	1
so	1
easily	1
pass	1
for	1
one	1
of	1
them.	1
Syme	1
was	1
scarcely	1
surprised	1
to	1
notice	1
that,	1
amid	1
all	1
the	1
ease	1
and	1
hospitality	1
of	1
their	1
new	1
surroundings,	1
this	1
man's	1
eyes	1
were	1
still	1
stern.	1
No	1
smell	1
of	1
ale	1
or	1
orchards	1
could	1
make	1
the	1
Secretary	1
cease	1
to	1
ask	1
a	1
reasonable	1
question.	1
If	1
Syme	1
had	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
see	1
himself,	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
realised	1
that	1
he,	1
too,	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
himself	1
and	1
no	1
one	1
else.	1
For	1
if	1
the	1
Secretary	1
stood	1
for	1
that	1
philosopher	1
who	1
loves	1
the	1
original	1
and	1
formless	1
light,	1
Syme	1
was	1
a	1
type	1
of	1
the	1
poet	1
who	1
seeks	1
always	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
light	1
in	1
special	1
shapes,	1
to	1
split	1
it	1
up	1
into	1
sun	1
and	1
star.	1
The	1
philosopher	1
may	1
sometimes	1
love	1
the	1
infinite;	1
the	1
poet	1
always	1
loves	1
the	1
finite.	1
For	1
him	1
the	1
great	1
moment	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
creation	1
of	1
light,	1
but	1
the	1
creation	1
of	1
the	1
sun	1
and	1
moon.	1
As	1
they	1
descended	1
the	1
broad	1
stairs	1
together	1
they	1
overtook	1
Ratcliffe,	1
who	1
was	1
clad	1
in	1
spring	1
green	1
like	1
a	1
huntsman,	1
and	1
the	1
pattern	1
upon	1
whose	1
garment	1
was	1
a	1
green	1
tangle	1
of	1
trees.	1
For	1
he	1
stood	1
for	1
that	1
third	1
day	1
on	1
which	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
green	1
things	1
were	1
made,	1
and	1
his	1
square,	1
sensible	1
face,	1
with	1
its	1
not	1
unfriendly	1
cynicism,	1
seemed	1
appropriate	1
enough	1
to	1
it.	1
They	1
were	1
led	1
out	1
of	1
another	1
broad	1
and	1
low	1
gateway	1
into	1
a	1
very	1
large	1
old	1
English	1
garden,	1
full	1
of	1
torches	1
and	1
bonfires,	1
by	1
the	1
broken	1
light	1
of	1
which	1
a	1
vast	1
carnival	1
of	1
people	1
were	1
dancing	1
in	1
motley	1
dress.	1
Syme	1
seemed	1
to	1
see	1
every	1
shape	1
in	1
Nature	1
imitated	1
in	1
some	1
crazy	1
costume.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
dressed	1
as	1
a	1
windmill	1
with	1
enormous	1
sails,	1
a	1
man	1
dressed	1
as	1
an	1
elephant,	1
a	1
man	1
dressed	1
as	1
a	1
balloon;	1
the	1
two	1
last,	1
together,	1
seemed	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
thread	1
of	1
their	1
farcical	1
adventures.	1
Syme	1
even	1
saw,	1
with	1
a	1
queer	1
thrill,	1
one	1
dancer	1
dressed	1
like	1
an	1
enormous	1
hornbill,	1
with	1
a	1
beak	1
twice	1
as	1
big	1
as	1
himself--the	1
queer	1
bird	1
which	1
had	1
fixed	1
itself	1
on	1
his	1
fancy	1
like	1
a	1
living	1
question	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
rushing	1
down	1
the	1
long	1
road	1
at	1
the	1
Zoological	1
Gardens.	1
There	1
were	1
a	1
thousand	1
other	1
such	1
objects,	1
however.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
dancing	1
lamp-post,	1
a	1
dancing	1
apple	1
tree,	1
a	1
dancing	1
ship.	1
One	1
would	1
have	1
thought	1
that	1
the	1
untamable	1
tune	1
of	1
some	1
mad	1
musician	1
had	1
set	1
all	1
the	1
common	1
objects	1
of	1
field	1
and	1
street	1
dancing	1
an	1
eternal	1
jig.	1
And	1
long	1
afterwards,	1
when	1
Syme	1
was	1
middle-aged	1
and	1
at	1
rest,	1
he	1
could	1
never	1
see	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
particular	1
objects--a	1
lamppost,	1
or	1
an	1
apple	1
tree,	1
or	1
a	1
windmill--	1
without	1
thinking	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
strayed	1
reveller	1
from	1
that	1
revel	1
of	1
masquerade.	1
On	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
this	1
lawn,	1
alive	1
with	1
dancers,	1
was	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
green	1
bank,	1
like	1
the	1
terrace	1
in	1
such	1
old-fashioned	1
gardens.	1
Along	1
this,	1
in	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
crescent,	1
stood	1
seven	1
great	1
chairs,	1
the	1
thrones	1
of	1
the	1
seven	1
days.	1
Gogol	1
and	1
Dr.	1
Bull	1
were	1
already	1
in	1
their	1
seats;	1
the	1
Professor	1
was	1
just	1
mounting	1
to	1
his.	1
Gogol,	1
or	1
Tuesday,	1
had	1
his	1
simplicity	1
well	1
symbolised	1
by	1
a	1
dress	1
designed	1
upon	1
the	1
division	1
of	1
the	1
waters,	1
a	1
dress	1
that	1
separated	1
upon	1
his	1
forehead	1
and	1
fell	1
to	1
his	1
feet,	1
grey	1
and	1
silver,	1
like	1
a	1
sheet	1
of	1
rain.	1
The	1
Professor,	1
whose	1
day	1
was	1
that	1
on	1
which	1
the	1
birds	1
and	1
fishes--the	1
ruder	1
forms	1
of	1
life--were	1
created,	1
had	1
a	1
dress	1
of	1
dim	1
purple,	1
over	1
which	1
sprawled	1
goggle-eyed	1
fishes	1
and	1
outrageous	1
tropical	1
birds,	1
the	1
union	1
in	1
him	1
of	1
unfathomable	1
fancy	1
and	1
of	1
doubt.	1
Dr.	1
Bull,	1
the	1
last	1
day	1
of	1
Creation,	1
wore	1
a	1
coat	1
covered	1
with	1
heraldic	1
animals	1
in	1
red	1
and	1
gold,	1
and	1
on	1
his	1
crest	1
a	1
man	1
rampant.	1
He	1
lay	1
back	1
in	1
his	1
chair	1
with	1
a	1
broad	1
smile,	1
the	1
picture	1
of	1
an	1
optimist	1
in	1
his	1
element.	1
One	1
by	1
one	1
the	1
wanderers	1
ascended	1
the	1
bank	1
and	1
sat	1
in	1
their	1
strange	1
seats.	1
As	1
each	1
of	1
them	1
sat	1
down	1
a	1
roar	1
of	1
enthusiasm	1
rose	1
from	1
the	1
carnival,	1
such	1
as	1
that	1
with	1
which	1
crowds	1
receive	1
kings.	1
Cups	1
were	1
clashed	1
and	1
torches	1
shaken,	1
and	1
feathered	1
hats	1
flung	1
in	1
the	1
air.	1
The	1
men	1
for	1
whom	1
these	1
thrones	1
were	1
reserved	1
were	1
men	1
crowned	1
with	1
some	1
extraordinary	1
laurels.	1
But	1
the	1
central	1
chair	1
was	1
empty.	1
Syme	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
hand	1
of	1
it	1
and	1
the	1
Secretary	1
on	1
the	1
right.	1
The	1
Secretary	1
looked	1
across	1
the	1
empty	1
throne	1
at	1
Syme,	1
and	1
said,	1
compressing	1
his	1
lips--	1
"We	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
yet	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
dead	1
in	1
a	1
field."	1
Almost	1
as	1
Syme	1
heard	1
the	1
words,	1
he	1
saw	1
on	1
the	1
sea	1
of	1
human	1
faces	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
him	1
a	1
frightful	1
and	1
beautiful	1
alteration,	1
as	1
if	1
heaven	1
had	1
opened	1
behind	1
his	1
head.	1
But	1
Sunday	1
had	1
only	1
passed	1
silently	1
along	1
the	1
front	1
like	1
a	1
shadow,	1
and	1
had	1
sat	1
in	1
the	1
central	1
seat.	1
He	1
was	1
draped	1
plainly,	1
in	1
a	1
pure	1
and	1
terrible	1
white,	1
and	1
his	1
hair	1
was	1
like	1
a	1
silver	1
flame	1
on	1
his	1
forehead.	1
For	1
a	1
long	1
time--it	1
seemed	1
for	1
hours--that	1
huge	1
masquerade	1
of	1
mankind	1
swayed	1
and	1
stamped	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
them	1
to	1
marching	1
and	1
exultant	1
music.	1
Every	1
couple	1
dancing	1
seemed	1
a	1
separate	1
romance;	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
a	1
fairy	1
dancing	1
with	1
a	1
pillar-box,	1
or	1
a	1
peasant	1
girl	1
dancing	1
with	1
the	1
moon;	1
but	1
in	1
each	1
case	1
it	1
was,	1
somehow,	1
as	1
absurd	1
as	1
Alice	1
in	1
Wonderland,	1
yet	1
as	1
grave	1
and	1
kind	1
as	1
a	1
love	1
story.	1
At	1
last,	1
however,	1
the	1
thick	1
crowd	1
began	1
to	1
thin	1
itself.	1
Couples	1
strolled	1
away	1
into	1
the	1
garden-walks,	1
or	1
began	1
to	1
drift	1
towards	1
that	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
building	1
where	1
stood	1
smoking,	1
in	1
huge	1
pots	1
like	1
fish-kettles,	1
some	1
hot	1
and	1
scented	1
mixtures	1
of	1
old	1
ale	1
or	1
wine.	1
Above	1
all	1
these,	1
upon	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
black	1
framework	1
on	1
the	1
roof	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
roared	1
in	1
its	1
iron	1
basket	1
a	1
gigantic	1
bonfire,	1
which	1
lit	1
up	1
the	1
land	1
for	1
miles.	1
It	1
flung	1
the	1
homely	1
effect	1
of	1
firelight	1
over	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
vast	1
forests	1
of	1
grey	1
or	1
brown,	1
and	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
fill	1
with	1
warmth	1
even	1
the	1
emptiness	1
of	1
upper	1
night.	1
Yet	1
this	1
also,	1
after	1
a	1
time,	1
was	1
allowed	1
to	1
grow	1
fainter;	1
the	1
dim	1
groups	1
gathered	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
round	1
the	1
great	1
cauldrons,	1
or	1
passed,	1
laughing	1
and	1
clattering,	1
into	1
the	1
inner	1
passages	1
of	1
that	1
ancient	1
house.	1
Soon	1
there	1
were	1
only	1
some	1
ten	1
loiterers	1
in	1
the	1
garden;	1
soon	1
only	1
four.	1
Finally	1
the	1
last	1
stray	1
merry-maker	1
ran	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
whooping	1
to	1
his	1
companions.	1
The	1
fire	1
faded,	1
and	1
the	1
slow,	1
strong	1
stars	1
came	1
out.	1
And	1
the	1
seven	1
strange	1
men	1
were	1
left	1
alone,	1
like	1
seven	1
stone	1
statues	1
on	1
their	1
chairs	1
of	1
stone.	1
Not	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
had	1
spoken	1
a	1
word.	1
They	1
seemed	1
in	1
no	1
haste	1
to	1
do	1
so,	1
but	1
heard	1
in	1
silence	1
the	1
hum	1
of	1
insects	1
and	1
the	1
distant	1
song	1
of	1
one	1
bird.	1
Then	1
Sunday	1
spoke,	1
but	1
so	1
dreamily	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
continuing	1
a	1
conversation	1
rather	1
than	1
beginning	1
one.	1
"We	1
will	1
eat	1
and	1
drink	1
later,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"Let	1
us	1
remain	1
together	1
a	1
little,	1
we	1
who	1
have	1
loved	1
each	1
other	1
so	1
sadly,	1
and	1
have	1
fought	1
so	1
long.	1
I	1
seem	1
to	1
remember	1
only	1
centuries	1
of	1
heroic	1
war,	1
in	1
which	1
you	1
were	1
always	1
heroes--epic	1
on	1
epic,	1
iliad	1
on	1
iliad,	1
and	1
you	1
always	1
brothers	1
in	1
arms.	1
Whether	1
it	1
was	1
but	1
recently	1
(for	1
time	1
is	1
nothing),	1
or	1
at	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
I	1
sent	1
you	1
out	1
to	1
war.	1
I	1
sat	1
in	1
the	1
darkness,	1
where	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
any	1
created	1
thing,	1
and	1
to	1
you	1
I	1
was	1
only	1
a	1
voice	1
commanding	1
valour	1
and	1
an	1
unnatural	1
virtue.	1
You	1
heard	1
the	1
voice	1
in	1
the	1
dark,	1
and	1
you	1
never	1
heard	1
it	1
again.	1
The	1
sun	1
in	1
heaven	1
denied	1
it,	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
sky	1
denied	1
it,	1
all	1
human	1
wisdom	1
denied	1
it.	1
And	1
when	1
I	1
met	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
daylight	1
I	1
denied	1
it	1
myself."	1
Syme	1
stirred	1
sharply	1
in	1
his	1
seat,	1
but	1
otherwise	1
there	1
was	1
silence,	1
and	1
the	1
incomprehensible	1
went	1
on.	1
"But	1
you	1
were	1
men.	1
You	1
did	1
not	1
forget	1
your	1
secret	1
honour,	1
though	1
the	1
whole	1
cosmos	1
turned	1
an	1
engine	1
of	1
torture	1
to	1
tear	1
it	1
out	1
of	1
you.	1
I	1
knew	1
how	1
near	1
you	1
were	1
to	1
hell.	1
I	1
know	1
how	1
you,	1
Thursday,	1
crossed	1
swords	1
with	1
King	1
Satan,	1
and	1
how	1
you,	1
Wednesday,	1
named	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
hour	1
without	1
hope."	1
There	1
was	1
complete	1
silence	1
in	1
the	1
starlit	1
garden,	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
black-browed	1
Secretary,	1
implacable,	1
turned	1
in	1
his	1
chair	1
towards	1
Sunday,	1
and	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
harsh	1
voice--	1
"Who	1
and	1
what	1
are	1
you?"	1
"I	1
am	1
the	1
Sabbath,"	1
said	1
the	1
other	1
without	1
moving.	1
"I	1
am	1
the	1
peace	1
of	1
God."	1
The	1
Secretary	1
started	1
up,	1
and	1
stood	1
crushing	1
his	1
costly	1
robe	1
in	1
his	1
hand.	1
"I	1
know	1
what	1
you	1
mean,"	1
he	1
cried,	1
"and	1
it	1
is	1
exactly	1
that	1
that	1
I	1
cannot	1
forgive	1
you.	1
I	1
know	1
you	1
are	1
contentment,	1
optimism,	1
what	1
do	1
they	1
call	1
the	1
thing,	1
an	1
ultimate	1
reconciliation.	1
Well,	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
reconciled.	1
If	1
you	1
were	1
the	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
dark	1
room,	1
why	1
were	1
you	1
also	1
Sunday,	1
an	1
offense	1
to	1
the	1
sunlight?	1
If	1
you	1
were	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
our	1
father	1
and	1
our	1
friend,	1
why	1
were	1
you	1
also	1
our	1
greatest	1
enemy?	1
We	1
wept,	1
we	1
fled	1
in	1
terror;	1
the	1
iron	1
entered	1
into	1
our	1
souls--and	1
you	1
are	1
the	1
peace	1
of	1
God!	1
Oh,	1
I	1
can	1
forgive	1
God	1
His	1
anger,	1
though	1
it	1
destroyed	1
nations;	1
but	1
I	1
cannot	1
forgive	1
Him	1
His	1
peace."	1
Sunday	1
answered	1
not	1
a	1
word,	1
but	1
very	1
slowly	1
he	1
turned	1
his	1
face	1
of	1
stone	1
upon	1
Syme	1
as	1
if	1
asking	1
a	1
question.	1
"No,"	1
said	1
Syme,	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
feel	1
fierce	1
like	1
that.	1
I	1
am	1
grateful	1
to	1
you,	1
not	1
only	1
for	1
wine	1
and	1
hospitality	1
here,	1
but	1
for	1
many	1
a	1
fine	1
scamper	1
and	1
free	1
fight.	1
But	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
know.	1
My	1
soul	1
and	1
heart	1
are	1
as	1
happy	1
and	1
quiet	1
here	1
as	1
this	1
old	1
garden,	1
but	1
my	1
reason	1
is	1
still	1
crying	1
out.	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
know."	1
Sunday	1
looked	1
at	1
Ratcliffe,	1
whose	1
clear	1
voice	1
said--	1
"It	1
seems	1
so	1
silly	1
that	1
you	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
on	1
both	1
sides	1
and	1
fought	1
yourself."	1
Bull	1
said--	1
"l	1
understand	1
nothing,	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
happy.	1
In	1
fact,	1
I	1
am	1
going	1
to	1
sleep."	1
"I	1
am	1
not	1
happy,"	1
said	1
the	1
Professor	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
in	1
his	1
hands,	1
"because	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
understand.	1
You	1
let	1
me	1
stray	1
a	1
little	1
too	1
near	1
to	1
hell."	1
And	1
then	1
Gogol	1
said,	1
with	1
the	1
absolute	1
simplicity	1
of	1
a	1
child--	1
"I	1
wish	1
I	1
knew	1
why	1
I	1
was	1
hurt	1
so	1
much."	1
Still	1
Sunday	1
said	1
nothing,	1
but	1
only	1
sat	1
with	1
his	1
mighty	1
chin	1
upon	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
gazed	1
at	1
the	1
distance.	1
Then	1
at	1
last	1
he	1
said--	1
"I	1
have	1
heard	1
your	1
complaints	1
in	1
order.	1
And	1
here,	1
I	1
think,	1
comes	1
another	1
to	1
complain,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
hear	1
him	1
also."	1
The	1
falling	1
fire	1
in	1
the	1
great	1
cresset	1
threw	1
a	1
last	1
long	1
gleam,	1
like	1
a	1
bar	1
of	1
burning	1
gold,	1
across	1
the	1
dim	1
grass.	1
Against	1
this	1
fiery	1
band	1
was	1
outlined	1
in	1
utter	1
black	1
the	1
advancing	1
legs	1
of	1
a	1
black-clad	1
figure.	1
He	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
fine	1
close	1
suit	1
with	1
knee-breeches	1
such	1
as	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
worn	1
by	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
only	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
blue,	1
but	1
of	1
this	1
absolute	1
sable.	1
He	1
had,	1
like	1
the	1
servants,	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
word	1
by	1
his	1
side.	1
It	1
was	1
only	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
quite	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
crescent	1
of	1
the	1
seven	1
and	1
flung	1
up	1
his	1
face	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
them,	1
that	1
Syme	1
saw,	1
with	1
thunder-struck	1
clearness,	1
that	1
the	1
face	1
was	1
the	1
broad,	1
almost	1
ape-like	1
face	1
of	1
his	1
old	1
friend	1
Gregory,	1
with	1
its	1
rank	1
red	1
hair	1
and	1
its	1
insulting	1
smile.	1
"Gregory!"	1
gasped	1
Syme,	1
half-rising	1
from	1
his	1
seat.	1
"Why,	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
real	1
anarchist!"	1
"Yes,"	1
said	1
Gregory,	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
and	1
dangerous	1
restraint,	1
"I	1
am	1
the	1
real	1
anarchist."	1
"'Now	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
day,'"	1
murmured	1
Bull,	1
who	1
seemed	1
really	1
to	1
have	1
fallen	1
asleep,	1
"'when	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
God	1
came	1
to	1
present	1
themselves	1
before	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
Satan	1
came	1
also	1
among	1
them.'"	1
"You	1
are	1
right,"	1
said	1
Gregory,	1
and	1
gazed	1
all	1
round.	1
"I	1
am	1
a	1
destroyer.	1
I	1
would	1
destroy	1
the	1
world	1
if	1
I	1
could."	1
A	1
sense	1
of	1
a	1
pathos	1
far	1
under	1
the	1
earth	1
stirred	1
up	1
in	1
Syme,	1
and	1
he	1
spoke	1
brokenly	1
and	1
without	1
sequence.	1
"Oh,	1
most	1
unhappy	1
man,"	1
he	1
cried,	1
"try	1
to	1
be	1
happy!	1
You	1
have	1
red	1
hair	1
like	1
your	1
sister."	1
"My	1
red	1
hair,	1
like	1
red	1
flames,	1
shall	1
burn	1
up	1
the	1
world,"	1
said	1
Gregory.	1
"I	1
thought	1
I	1
hated	1
everything	1
more	1
than	1
common	1
men	1
can	1
hate	1
anything;	1
but	1
I	1
find	1
that	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
hate	1
everything	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
I	1
hate	1
you!	1
"	1
"I	1
never	1
hated	1
you,"	1
said	1
Syme	1
very	1
sadly.	1
Then	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
unintelligible	1
creature	1
the	1
last	1
thunders	1
broke.	1
"You!"	1
he	1
cried.	1
"You	1
never	1
hated	1
because	1
you	1
never	1
lived.	1
I	1
know	1
what	1
you	1
are	1
all	1
of	1
you,	1
from	1
first	1
to	1
last--you	1
are	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
power!	1
You	1
are	1
the	1
police--the	1
great	1
fat,	1
smiling	1
men	1
in	1
blue	1
and	1
buttons!	1
You	1
are	1
the	1
Law,	1
and	1
you	1
have	1
never	1
been	1
broken.	1
But	1
is	1
there	1
a	1
free	1
soul	1
alive	1
that	1
does	1
not	1
long	1
to	1
break	1
you,	1
only	1
because	1
you	1
have	1
never	1
been	1
broken?	1
We	1
in	1
revolt	1
talk	1
all	1
kind	1
of	1
nonsense	1
doubtless	1
about	1
this	1
crime	1
or	1
that	1
crime	1
of	1
the	1
Government.	1
It	1
is	1
all	1
folly!	1
The	1
only	1
crime	1
of	1
the	1
Government	1
is	1
that	1
it	1
governs.	1
The	1
unpardonable	1
sin	1
of	1
the	1
supreme	1
power	1
is	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
supreme.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
curse	1
you	1
for	1
being	1
cruel.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
curse	1
you	1
(though	1
I	1
might)	1
for	1
being	1
kind.	1
I	1
curse	1
you	1
for	1
being	1
safe!	1
You	1
sit	1
in	1
your	1
chairs	1
of	1
stone,	1
and	1
have	1
never	1
come	1
down	1
from	1
them.	1
You	1
are	1
the	1
seven	1
angels	1
of	1
heaven,	1
and	1
you	1
have	1
had	1
no	1
troubles.	1
Oh,	1
I	1
could	1
forgive	1
you	1
everything,	1
you	1
that	1
rule	1
all	1
mankind,	1
if	1
I	1
could	1
feel	1
for	1
once	1
that	1
you	1
had	1
suffered	1
for	1
one	1
hour	1
a	1
real	1
agony	1
such	1
as	1
I--"	1
Syme	1
sprang	1
to	1
his	1
feet,	1
shaking	1
from	1
head	1
to	1
foot.	1
"I	1
see	1
everything,"	1
he	1
cried,	1
"everything	1
that	1
there	1
is.	1
Why	1
does	1
each	1
thing	1
on	1
the	1
earth	1
war	1
against	1
each	1
other	1
thing?	1
Why	1
does	1
each	1
small	1
thing	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
have	1
to	1
fight	1
against	1
the	1
world	1
itself?	1
Why	1
does	1
a	1
fly	1
have	1
to	1
fight	1
the	1
whole	1
universe?	1
Why	1
does	1
a	1
dandelion	1
have	1
to	1
fight	1
the	1
whole	1
universe?	1
For	1
the	1
same	1
reason	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
alone	1
in	1
the	1
dreadful	1
Council	1
of	1
the	1
Days.	1
So	1
that	1
each	1
thing	1
that	1
obeys	1
law	1
may	1
have	1
the	1
glory	1
and	1
isolation	1
of	1
the	1
anarchist.	1
So	1
that	1
each	1
man	1
fighting	1
for	1
order	1
may	1
be	1
as	1
brave	1
and	1
good	1
a	1
man	1
as	1
the	1
dynamiter.	1
So	1
that	1
the	1
real	1
lie	1
of	1
Satan	1
may	1
be	1
flung	1
back	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
this	1
blasphemer,	1
so	1
that	1
by	1
tears	1
and	1
torture	1
we	1
may	1
earn	1
the	1
right	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
this	1
man,	1
'You	1
lie!'	1
No	1
agonies	1
can	1
be	1
too	1
great	1
to	1
buy	1
the	1
right	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
this	1
accuser,	1
'We	1
also	1
have	1
suffered.'	1
"It	1
is	1
not	1
true	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
never	1
been	1
broken.	1
We	1
have	1
been	1
broken	1
upon	1
the	1
wheel.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
true	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
never	1
descended	1
from	1
these	1
thrones.	1
We	1
have	1
descended	1
into	1
hell.	1
We	1
were	1
complaining	1
of	1
unforgettable	1
miseries	1
even	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
moment	1
when	1
this	1
man	1
entered	1
insolently	1
to	1
accuse	1
us	1
of	1
happiness.	1
I	1
repel	1
the	1
slander;	1
we	1
have	1
not	1
been	1
happy.	1
I	1
can	1
answer	1
for	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
guards	1
of	1
Law	1
whom	1
he	1
has	1
accused.	1
At	1
least--"	1
He	1
had	1
turned	1
his	1
eyes	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
see	1
suddenly	1
the	1
great	1
face	1
of	1
Sunday,	1
which	1
wore	1
a	1
strange	1
smile.	1
"Have	1
you,"	1
he	1
cried	1
in	1
a	1
dreadful	1
voice,	1
"have	1
you	1
ever	1
suffered?"	1
As	1
he	1
gazed,	1
the	1
great	1
face	1
grew	1
to	1
an	1
awful	1
size,	1
grew	1
larger	1
than	1
the	1
colossal	1
mask	1
of	1
Memnon,	1
which	1
had	1
made	1
him	1
scream	1
as	1
a	1
child.	1
It	1
grew	1
larger	1
and	1
larger,	1
filling	1
the	1
whole	1
sky;	1
then	1
everything	1
went	1
black.	1
Only	1
in	1
the	1
blackness	1
before	1
it	1
entirely	1
destroyed	1
his	1
brain	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
hear	1
a	1
distant	1
voice	1
saying	1
a	1
commonplace	1
text	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
somewhere,	1
"Can	1
ye	1
drink	1
of	1
the	1
cup	1
that	1
I	1
drink	1
of?"	1

When	1
men	1
in	1
books	1
awake	1
from	1
a	1
vision,	1
they	1
commonly	1
find	1
themselves	1
in	1
some	1
place	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
might	1
have	1
fallen	1
asleep;	1
they	1
yawn	1
in	1
a	1
chair,	1
or	1
lift	1
themselves	1
with	1
bruised	1
limbs	1
from	1
a	1
field.	1
Syme's	1
experience	1
was	1
something	1
much	1
more	1
psychologically	1
strange	1
if	1
there	1
was	1
indeed	1
anything	1
unreal,	1
in	1
the	1
earthly	1
sense,	1
about	1
the	1
things	1
he	1
had	1
gone	1
through.	1
For	1
while	1
he	1
could	1
always	1
remember	1
afterwards	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
swooned	1
before	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
Sunday,	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
remember	1
having	1
ever	1
come	1
to	1
at	1
all.	1
He	1
could	1
only	1
remember	1
that	1
gradually	1
and	1
naturally	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
and	1
had	1
been	1
walking	1
along	1
a	1
country	1
lane	1
with	1
an	1
easy	1
and	1
conversational	1
companion.	1
That	1
companion	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
recent	1
drama;	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
red-haired	1
poet	1
Gregory.	1
They	1
were	1
walking	1
like	1
old	1
friends,	1
and	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
a	1
conversation	1
about	1
some	1
triviality.	1
But	1
Syme	1
could	1
only	1
feel	1
an	1
unnatural	1
buoyancy	1
in	1
his	1
body	1
and	1
a	1
crystal	1
simplicity	1
in	1
his	1
mind	1
that	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
superior	1
to	1
everything	1
that	1
he	1
said	1
or	1
did.	1
He	1
felt	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
possession	1
of	1
some	1
impossible	1
good	1
news,	1
which	1
made	1
every	1
other	1
thing	1
a	1
triviality,	1
but	1
an	1
adorable	1
triviality.	1
Dawn	1
was	1
breaking	1
over	1
everything	1
in	1
colours	1
at	1
once	1
clear	1
and	1
timid;	1
as	1
if	1
Nature	1
made	1
a	1
first	1
attempt	1
at	1
yellow	1
and	1
a	1
first	1
attempt	1
at	1
rose.	1
A	1
breeze	1
blew	1
so	1
clean	1
and	1
sweet,	1
that	1
one	1
could	1
not	1
think	1
that	1
it	1
blew	1
from	1
the	1
sky;	1
it	1
blew	1
rather	1
through	1
some	1
hole	1
in	1
the	1
sky.	1
Syme	1
felt	1
a	1
simple	1
surprise	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
rising	1
all	1
round	1
him	1
on	1
both	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
road	1
the	1
red,	1
irregular	1
buildings	1
of	1
Saffron	1
Park.	1
He	1
had	1
no	1
idea	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
walked	1
so	1
near	1
London.	1
He	1
walked	1
by	1
instinct	1
along	1
one	1
white	1
road,	1
on	1
which	1
early	1
birds	1
hopped	1
and	1
sang,	1
and	1
found	1
himself	1
outside	1
a	1
fenced	1
garden.	1
There	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
sister	1
of	1
Gregory,	1
the	1
girl	1
with	1
the	1
gold-red	1
hair,	1
cutting	1
lilac	1
before	1
breakfast,	1
with	1
the	1
great	1
unconscious	1
gravity	1
of	1
a	1
girl.	1
