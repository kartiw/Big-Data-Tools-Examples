Information	1

Project	1

(one	1
page)	1
We	1
produce	1
about	1
two	1
million	1
dollars	1
for	1
each	1
hour	1
we	1
work.	1
The	1
fifty	1
hours	1
is	1
one	1
conservative	1
estimate	1
for	1
how	1
long	1
it	1
we	1
take	1
to	1
get	1
any	1
etext	1
selected,	1
entered,	1
proofread,	1
edited,	1
copyright	1
searched	1
and	1
analyzed,	1
the	1
copyright	1
letters	1
written,	1
etc.	1
This	1
projected	1
audience	1
is	1
one	1
hundred	1
million	1
readers.	1
If	1
our	1
value	1
per	1
text	1
is	1
nominally	1
estimated	1
at	1
one	1
dollar,	1
then	1
we	1
produce	1
2	1
million	1
dollars	1
per	1
hour	1
this	1
year	1
we,	1
will	1
have	1
to	1
do	1
four	1
text	1
files	1
per	1
month:	1
thus	1
upping	1
our	1
productivity	1
from	1
one	1
million.	1
The	1
Goal	1
of	1

is	1
to	1
Give	1

December	1
31,	1
2001.	1
[10,000	1

This	1
is	1
ten	1
thousand	1
titles	1
each	1
to	1
one	1
hundred	1
million	1
readers,	1
which	1
is	1
10%	1
of	1
the	1
expected	1
number	1
of	1

the	1

Why	1
is	1
this	1
"Small	1
Print!"	1
statement	1
here?	1
You	1
know:	1
lawyers.	1
They	1
tell	1
us	1
you	1
might	1
sue	1
us	1
if	1
there	1
is	1
something	1
wrong	1
with	1
your	1
copy	1
of	1
this	1
etext,	1
even	1
if	1
you	1
got	1
it	1
for	1
free	1
from	1
someone	1
other	1
than	1
us,	1
and	1
even	1
if	1
what's	1
wrong	1
is	1
not	1
our	1
fault.	1
So,	1
among	1
other	1
things,	1
this	1
"Small	1
Print!"	1
statement	1
disclaims	1
most	1
of	1
our	1
liability	1
to	1
you.	1
It	1
also	1
tells	1
you	1
how	1
you	1
can	1
distribute	1
copies	1
of	1
this	1
etext	1
if	1
you	1
want	1
