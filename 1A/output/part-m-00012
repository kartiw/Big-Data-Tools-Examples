At	1

Dar'd	1

of	1
our	1

esteem'd	1

Did	1
slay	1
this	1
Fortinbras:	1
who	1
by	1
a	1
Seal'd	1
Compact,	1
Well	1
ratified	1
by	1
Law,	1
and	1
Heraldrie,	1
Did	1
forfeite	1

Lands	1
Which	1
he	1
stood	1
seiz'd	1

Laertes,	1
That	1

The	1
Hand	1
more	1

Laer.	1
Dread	1
my	1

Your	1

From	1

though	1
willingly	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
Denmarke	1
To	1
shew	1
my	1
duty	1
in	1
your	1
Coronation,	1
Yet	1
now	1
I	1
must	1
confesse,	1
that	1
duty	1
done,	1
My	1
thoughts	1
and	1
wishes	1
bend	1
againe	1
towards	1
France,	1
And	1
bow	1
them	1
to	1
your	1

pardon	1
King.	1
Haue	1
you	1

What	1

Pol.	1
He	1

I	1
do	1
beseech	1
you	1

leaue	1

Take	1
thy	1

Laertes,	1
time	1
be	1
thine,	1
And	1
thy	1
best	1
graces	1

it	1
at	1
thy	1
will:	1
But	1
now	1
my	1
Cosin	1
Hamlet,	1
and	1
my	1
Sonne?	1
Ham.	1
A	1
little	1
more	1
then	1
kin,	1
and	1
lesse	1
then	1
kinde	1
King.	1
How	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
the	1
Clouds	1
still	1
hang	1
on	1
you?	1
Ham.	1
Not	1
so	1
my	1
Lord,	1
I	1
am	1
too	1
much	1
i'th'	1
Sun	1
Queen.	1
Good	1
Hamlet	1
cast	1
thy	1
nightly	1
colour	1
off,	1
And	1
let	1
thine	1
eye	1
looke	1
like	1
a	1
Friend	1
on	1
Denmarke.	1
Do	1
not	1
for	1
euer	1
with	1
thy	1
veyled	1
lids	1
Seeke	1
for	1
thy	1
Noble	1
Father	1
in	1
the	1
dust;	1
Thou	1
know'st	1
'tis	1
common,	1
all	1
that	1
liues	1
must	1
dye,	1
Passing	1
through	1
Nature,	1
to	1
Eternity	1
Ham.	1
I	1
Madam,	1
it	1
is	1
common	1
Queen.	1
If	1
it	1
be;	1
Why	1
seemes	1
it	1
so	1
particular	1
with	1
thee	1
Ham.	1
Seemes	1
Madam?	1
Nay,	1
it	1
is:	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
Seemes:	1
'Tis	1
not	1
alone	1
my	1
Inky	1
Cloake	1
(good	1
Mother)	1
Nor	1
Customary	1
suites	1
of	1
solemne	1
Blacke,	1
Nor	1
windy	1
suspiration	1
of	1
forc'd	1
breath,	1
No,	1
nor	1
the	1
fruitfull	1
Riuer	1
in	1
the	1
Eye,	1
Nor	1
the	1
deiected	1
hauiour	1
of	1
the	1
Visage,	1
Together	1
with	1
all	1
Formes,	1
Moods,	1
shewes	1
of	1
Griefe,	1
That	1
can	1
denote	1
me	1
truly.	1
These	1
indeed	1
Seeme,	1
For	1
they	1
are	1
actions	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
might	1
play:	1
But	1
I	1
haue	1
that	1
Within,	1
which	1
passeth	1
show;	1
These,	1
but	1
the	1
Trappings,	1
and	1
the	1
Suites	1
of	1
woe	1
King.	1
'Tis	1
sweet	1
and	1
commendable	1
In	1
your	1
Nature	1
Hamlet,	1
To	1
giue	1
these	1
mourning	1
duties	1
to	1
your	1
Father:	1
But	1
you	1
must	1
know,	1
your	1
Father	1
lost	1
a	1
Father,	1
That	1
Father	1
lost,	1
lost	1
his,	1
and	1
the	1
Suruiuer	1
bound	1
In	1
filiall	1
Obligation,	1
for	1
some	1
terme	1
To	1
do	1
obsequious	1
Sorrow.	1
But	1
to	1
perseuer	1
In	1
obstinate	1
Condolement,	1
is	1
a	1
course	1
Of	1
impious	1
stubbornnesse.	1
'Tis	1
vnmanly	1
greefe,	1
It	1
shewes	1
a	1
will	1
most	1
incorrect	1
to	1
Heauen,	1
A	1
Heart	1
vnfortified,	1
a	1
Minde	1
impatient,	1
An	1
Vnderstanding	1
simple,	1
and	1
vnschool'd:	1
For,	1
what	1
we	1
know	1
must	1
be,	1
and	1
is	1
as	1
common	1
As	1
any	1
the	1
most	1
vulgar	1
thing	1
to	1
sence,	1
Why	1
should	1
we	1
in	1
our	1
peeuish	1
Opposition	1
Take	1
it	1
to	1
heart?	1
Fye,	1
'tis	1
a	1
fault	1
to	1
Heauen,	1
A	1
fault	1
against	1
the	1
Dead,	1
a	1
fault	1
to	1
Nature,	1
To	1
Reason	1
most	1
absurd,	1
whose	1
common	1
Theame	1
Is	1
death	1
of	1
Fathers,	1
and	1
who	1
still	1
hath	1
cried,	1
From	1
the	1
first	1
Coarse,	1
till	1
he	1
that	1
dyed	1
to	1
day,	1
This	1
must	1
be	1
so.	1
We	1
pray	1
you	1
throw	1
to	1
earth	1
This	1
vnpreuayling	1
woe,	1
and	1
thinke	1
of	1
vs	1
As	1
of	1
a	1
Father;	1
For	1
let	1
the	1
world	1
take	1
note,	1
You	1
are	1
the	1
most	1
immediate	1
to	1
our	1
Throne,	1
And	1
with	1
no	1
lesse	1
Nobility	1
of	1
Loue,	1
Then	1
that	1
which	1
deerest	1
Father	1
beares	1
his	1
Sonne,	1
Do	1
I	1
impart	1
towards	1
you.	1
For	1
your	1
intent	1
In	1
going	1
backe	1
to	1
Schoole	1
in	1
Wittenberg,	1
It	1
is	1
most	1
retrograde	1
to	1
our	1
desire:	1
And	1
we	1
beseech	1
you,	1
bend	1
you	1
to	1
remaine	1
Heere	1
in	1
the	1
cheere	1
and	1
comfort	1
of	1
our	1
eye,	1
Our	1
cheefest	1
Courtier	1
Cosin,	1
and	1
our	1
Sonne	1
Qu.	1
Let	1
not	1
thy	1
Mother	1
lose	1
her	1
Prayers	1
Hamlet:	1
I	1
prythee	1
stay	1
with	1
vs,	1
go	1
not	1
to	1
Wittenberg	1
Ham.	1
I	1
shall	1
in	1
all	1
my	1
best	1
Obey	1
you	1
Madam	1
King.	1
Why	1
'tis	1
a	1
louing,	1
and	1
a	1
faire	1
Reply,	1
Be	1
as	1
our	1
selfe	1
in	1
Denmarke.	1
Madam	1
come,	1
This	1
gentle	1
and	1
vnforc'd	1
accord	1
of	1
Hamlet	1
Sits	1
smiling	1
to	1
my	1
heart;	1
in	1
grace	1
whereof,	1
No	1
iocond	1
health	1
that	1
Denmarke	1
drinkes	1
to	1
day,	1
But	1
the	1
great	1
Cannon	1
to	1
the	1
Clowds	1
shall	1
tell,	1
And	1
the	1
Kings	1
Rouce,	1
the	1
Heauens	1
shall	1
bruite	1
againe,	1
Respeaking	1

Thunder.	1
Come	1
away.	1
Exeunt.	1
Manet	1
Hamlet.	1
Ham.	1
Oh	1
that	1
this	1
too	1
too	1
solid	1
Flesh,	1
would	1
melt,	1
Thaw,	1
and	1
resolue	1
it	1

into	1
a	1
Dew:	1
Or	1
that	1

not	1
fixt	1
His	1
Cannon	1
'gainst	1
Selfe-slaughter.	1
O	1
God,	1
O	1
God!	1
How	1
weary,	1
stale,	1
flat,	1
and	1
vnprofitable	1
Seemes	1
to	1
me	1
all	1
the	1
vses	1
of	1
this	1

Fie	1
on't?	1
Oh	1
fie,	1
fie,	1
'tis	1
an	1
vnweeded	1
Garden	1
That	1
growes	1
to	1
Seed:	1
Things	1
rank,	1
and	1
grosse	1
in	1
Nature	1
Possesse	1
it	1
meerely.	1
That	1
it	1
should	1
come	1
to	1
this:	1
But	1
two	1
months	1
dead:	1
Nay,	1
not	1
so	1
much;	1
not	1
two,	1
So	1
excellent	1
a	1
King,	1
that	1
was	1
to	1
this	1
Hiperion	1
to	1
a	1
Satyre:	1
so	1
louing	1
to	1
my	1
Mother,	1
That	1
he	1
might	1
not	1
beteene	1
the	1
windes	1
of	1
heauen	1
Visit	1
her	1
face	1
too	1
roughly.	1
Heauen	1
and	1
Earth	1
Must	1
I	1
remember:	1
why	1
she	1
would	1
hang	1
on	1
him,	1
As	1
if	1
encrease	1
of	1
Appetite	1
had	1
growne	1
By	1
what	1
is	1
fed	1
on;	1
and	1
yet	1
within	1
a	1
month?	1
Let	1
me	1
not	1
thinke	1
on't:	1
Frailty,	1
thy	1
name	1
is	1
woman.	1
A	1
little	1
Month,	1
or	1
ere	1
those	1
shooes	1
were	1
old,	1
With	1
which	1
she	1
followed	1
my	1
poore	1
Fathers	1
body	1
Like	1
Niobe,	1
all	1
teares.	1
Why	1
she,	1
euen	1
she.	1
(O	1
Heauen!	1
A	1
beast	1
that	1
wants	1
discourse	1
of	1
Reason	1
Would	1
haue	1
mourn'd	1
longer)	1
married	1
with	1
mine	1
Vnkle,	1
My	1
Fathers	1
Brother:	1
but	1
no	1
more	1
like	1
my	1
Father,	1
Then	1
I	1
to	1
Hercules.	1
Within	1
a	1
Moneth?	1
Ere	1
yet	1
the	1
salt	1
of	1
most	1
vnrighteous	1
Teares	1
Had	1
left	1
the	1
flushing	1
of	1
her	1
gauled	1

She	1
married.	1
O	1
most	1
wicked	1
speed,	1
to	1
post	1
With	1
such	1
dexterity	1
to	1
Incestuous	1
sheets:	1
It	1
is	1
not,	1
nor	1
it	1
cannot	1
come	1
to	1
good.	1
But	1
breake	1
my	1

for	1
I	1
must	1
hold	1
my	1

Enter	1

A	1

I	1
would	1

To	1

I	1
pray	1
thee	1
doe	1
not	1
mock	1
me	1
(fellow	1
Student)	1
I	1
thinke	1
it	1
was	1
to	1

Wedding	1
Hor.	1
Indeed	1
my	1

Horatio:	1
the	1
Funerall	1
Bakt-meats	1
Did	1

Would	1

Ere	1

My	1

Oh	1

Ham.	1
In	1
my	1

(Horatio)	1
Hor.	1
I	1
saw	1
him	1
once;	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
goodly	1
King	1
Ham.	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
man,	1
take	1
him	1
for	1

I	1
shall	1
not	1
look	1
vpon	1

My	1

I	1
thinke	1
I	1

Saw?	1
Who?	1
Hor.	1
My	1

Season	1

With	1

Vpon	1

This	1

For	1
Heauens	1

Hor.	1
Two	1
nights	1
together,	1
had	1
these	1
Gentlemen	1
(Marcellus	1
and	1
Barnardo)	1
on	1
their	1
Watch	1
In	1
the	1
dead	1
wast	1
and	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
Beene	1
thus	1
encountred.	1
A	1
figure	1
like	1
your	1
Father,	1
Arm'd	1
at	1
all	1
points	1
exactly,	1
Cap	1
a	1
Pe,	1
Appeares	1
before	1
them,	1
and	1
with	1
sollemne	1
march	1
Goes	1
slow	1

stately:	1
By	1
them	1
thrice	1
he	1
walkt,	1
By	1
their	1
opprest	1
and	1
feare-surprized	1
eyes,	1
Within	1

Truncheons	1
length;	1
whilst	1
they	1
bestil'd	1
Almost	1
to	1
Ielly	1
with	1
the	1
Act	1
of	1
feare,	1
Stand	1
dumbe	1

This	1
to	1
me	1
In	1
dreadfull	1

they	1
did,	1
And	1
I	1
with	1
them	1
the	1
third	1
Night	1
kept	1
the	1
Watch,	1
Whereas	1
they	1
had	1
deliuer'd	1
both	1
in	1
time,	1
Forme	1
of	1
the	1
thing;	1
each	1
word	1
made	1
true	1
and	1
good,	1
The	1
Apparition	1
comes.	1
I	1
knew	1
your	1
Father:	1
These	1
hands	1
are	1
not	1
more	1
like	1
Ham.	1
But	1
where	1
was	1
this?	1
Mar.	1
My	1
Lord	1
vpon	1
the	1
platforme	1
where	1
we	1
watcht	1
Ham.	1
Did	1
you	1
not	1
speake	1
to	1
it?	1
Hor.	1
My	1
Lord,	1
I	1
did;	1
But	1
answere	1
made	1
it	1
none:	1
yet	1
once	1
me	1
thought	1
It	1
lifted	1
vp	1
it	1
head,	1
and	1
did	1
addresse	1
It	1
selfe	1
to	1
motion,	1
like	1
as	1
it	1
would	1
speake:	1
But	1
euen	1
then,	1
the	1
Morning	1
Cocke	1
crew	1
lowd;	1
And	1
at	1
the	1
sound	1
it	1
shrunke	1
in	1
hast	1
away,	1
And	1
vanisht	1
from	1
our	1
sight	1
Ham.	1
Tis	1
very	1
strange	1
Hor.	1
As	1
I	1
doe	1
liue	1
my	1
honourd	1
Lord	1
'tis	1
true;	1
And	1
we	1
did	1
thinke	1
it	1
writ	1
downe	1
in	1
our	1
duty	1
To	1
let	1
you	1
know	1
of	1
it	1
Ham.	1
Indeed,	1
indeed	1
Sirs;	1
but	1
this	1
troubles	1
me.	1
Hold	1
you	1
the	1
watch	1
to	1
Night?	1
Both.	1
We	1
doe	1
my	1
Lord	1
Ham.	1
Arm'd,	1
say	1
you?	1
Both.	1
Arm'd,	1
my	1
Lord	1
Ham.	1
From	1
top	1
to	1
toe?	1
Both.	1
My	1
Lord,	1
from	1
head	1
to	1
foote	1
Ham.	1
Then	1
saw	1
you	1
not	1
his	1
face?	1
Hor.	1
O	1
yes,	1
my	1
Lord,	1
he	1
wore	1
his	1
Beauer	1
vp	1
Ham.	1
What,	1
lookt	1
he	1
frowningly?	1
Hor.	1
A	1
countenance	1
more	1
in	1
sorrow	1
then	1
in	1
anger	1
Ham.	1
Pale,	1
or	1
red?	1
Hor.	1
Nay	1
very	1
pale	1
Ham.	1
And	1
fixt	1
his	1
eyes	1
vpon	1
you?	1
Hor.	1
Most	1
constantly	1
Ham.	1
I	1
would	1
I	1
had	1
beene	1
there	1
Hor.	1
It	1
would	1
haue	1
much	1
amaz'd	1
you	1
Ham.	1
Very	1
like,	1
very	1
like:	1
staid	1
it	1
long?	1
Hor.	1
While	1
one	1
with	1
moderate	1
hast	1
might	1
tell	1
a	1
hundred	1
All.	1
Longer,	1
longer	1
Hor.	1
Not	1
when	1
I	1
saw't	1
Ham.	1
His	1
Beard	1
was	1
grisly?	1
no	1
Hor.	1
It	1
was,	1
as	1
I	1
haue	1
seene	1
it	1
in	1
his	1
life,	1
A	1
Sable	1
Siluer'd	1
Ham.	1
Ile	1
watch	1
to	1
Night;	1
perchance	1
'twill	1
wake	1
againe	1
Hor.	1
I	1
warrant	1
you	1
it	1
will	1
Ham.	1
If	1
it	1
assume	1
my	1
noble	1
Fathers	1
person,	1
Ile	1
speake	1
to	1
it,	1
though	1
Hell	1
it	1
selfe	1
should	1
gape	1
And	1
bid	1
me	1
hold	1
my	1
peace.	1
I	1
pray	1
you	1
all,	1
If	1
you	1
haue	1
hitherto	1
conceald	1
this	1
sight;	1
Let	1
it	1
bee	1
treble	1
in	1
your	1
silence	1
still:	1
And	1
whatsoeuer	1
els	1
shall	1
hap	1
to	1
night,	1
Giue	1
it	1
an	1
vnderstanding	1
but	1
no	1
tongue;	1
I	1
will	1
requite	1
your	1
loues;	1
so	1
fare	1
ye	1
well:	1
Vpon	1
the	1
Platforme	1
twixt	1
eleuen	1
and	1
twelue,	1
Ile	1
visit	1
you	1
All.	1
Our	1
duty	1
to	1
your	1
Honour.	1
Exeunt	1
Ham.	1
Your	1
loue,	1
as	1
mine	1
to	1
you:	1
farewell.	1
My	1
Fathers	1
Spirit	1
in	1
Armes?	1
All	1
is	1
not	1
well:	1
I	1
doubt	1
some	1
foule	1
play:	1
would	1
the	1
Night	1
were	1
come;	1
Till	1
then	1
sit	1
still	1
my	1
soule;	1
foule	1
deeds	1
will	1
rise,	1
Though	1
all	1
the	1
earth	1
orewhelm	1
them	1
to	1
mens	1
eies.	1
Enter.	1
Scena	1
Tertia	1
Enter	1
Laertes	1
and	1
Ophelia.	1
Laer.	1
My	1
necessaries	1
are	1
imbark't;	1
Farewell:	1
And	1
Sister,	1
as	1
the	1
Winds	1
giue	1
Benefit,	1
And	1
Conuoy	1
is	1
assistant;	1
doe	1
not	1
sleepe,	1
But	1
let	1
me	1
heare	1
from	1
you	1
Ophel.	1
Doe	1
you	1
doubt	1
that?	1
Laer.	1
For	1
Hamlet,	1
and	1
the	1
trifling	1
of	1
his	1
fauours,	1
Hold	1
it	1
a	1
fashion	1
and	1
a	1
toy	1
in	1
Bloude;	1
A	1
Violet	1
in	1
the	1
youth	1
of	1
Primy	1
Nature;	1
Froward,	1
not	1
permanent;	1
sweet	1
not	1
lasting	1
The	1
suppliance	1
of	1
a	1
minute?	1
No	1
more	1
Ophel.	1
No	1
more	1
but	1
so	1
Laer.	1
Thinke	1
it	1
no	1
more:	1
For	1
nature	1
cressant	1
does	1
not	1
grow	1
alone,	1
In	1
thewes	1
and	1
Bulke:	1
but	1
as	1
his	1
Temple	1
waxes,	1
The	1
inward	1
seruice	1
of	1
the	1
Minde	1
and	1
Soule	1
Growes	1
wide	1
withall.	1
Perhaps	1
he	1
loues	1
you	1
now,	1
And	1
now	1
no	1
soyle	1
nor	1
cautell	1
doth	1
besmerch	1
The	1
vertue	1
of	1
his	1
feare:	1
but	1
you	1
must	1
feare	1
His	1
greatnesse	1
weigh'd,	1
his	1
will	1
is	1
not	1
his	1
owne;	1
For	1
hee	1
himselfe	1
is	1
subiect	1
to	1
his	1
Birth:	1
Hee	1
may	1
not,	1
as	1
vnuallued	1
persons	1
doe,	1
Carue	1
for	1
himselfe;	1
for,	1
on	1
his	1
choyce	1
depends	1
The	1
sanctity	1
and	1
health	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
State.	1
And	1
therefore	1
must	1
his	1
choyce	1
be	1
circumscrib'd	1
Vnto	1
the	1
voyce	1
and	1
yeelding	1
of	1
that	1
Body,	1
Whereof	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
Head.	1
Then	1
if	1
he	1
sayes	1
he	1
loues	1
you,	1
It	1
fits	1
your	1
wisedome	1
so	1
farre	1
to	1
beleeue	1
it;	1
As	1
he	1
in	1
his	1
peculiar	1
Sect	1
and	1
force	1
May	1
giue	1
his	1
saying	1
deed:	1
which	1
is	1
no	1
further,	1
Then	1
the	1
maine	1
voyce	1
of	1
Denmarke	1
goes	1
withall.	1
Then	1
weight	1
what	1
losse	1
your	1
Honour	1
may	1
sustaine,	1
If	1
with	1
too	1
credent	1
eare	1
you	1
list	1
his	1
Songs;	1
Or	1
lose	1
your	1
Heart;	1
or	1
your	1
chast	1
Treasure	1
open	1
To	1
his	1
vnmastred	1
importunity.	1
Feare	1
it	1
Ophelia,	1
feare	1
it	1
my	1
deare	1
Sister,	1
And	1
keepe	1
within	1
the	1
reare	1
of	1
your	1
Affection;	1
Out	1
of	1
the	1
shot	1
and	1
danger	1
of	1
Desire.	1
The	1
chariest	1
Maid	1
is	1
Prodigall	1
enough,	1
If	1
she	1
vnmaske	1
her	1
beauty	1
to	1
the	1
Moone:	1
Vertue	1
it	1
selfe	1
scapes	1
not	1
calumnious	1
stroakes,	1
The	1
Canker	1
Galls,	1
the	1
Infants	1
of	1
the	1
Spring	1
Too	1
oft	1
before	1
the	1
buttons	1
be	1
disclos'd,	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
Morne	1
and	1
liquid	1
dew	1
of	1
Youth,	1
Contagious	1
blastments	1
are	1
most	1
imminent.	1
Be	1
wary	1
then,	1
best	1
safety	1
lies	1
in	1
feare;	1
Youth	1
to	1
it	1
selfe	1
rebels,	1
though	1
none	1
else	1
neere	1
Ophe.	1
I	1
shall	1
th'	1
effect	1
of	1
this	1
good	1
Lesson	1
keepe,	1
As	1
watchmen	1
to	1
my	1
heart:	1
but	1
good	1
my	1
Brother	1
Doe	1
not	1
as	1
some	1
vngracious	1
Pastors	1
doe,	1
Shew	1
me	1
the	1
steepe	1
and	1
thorny	1
way	1
to	1
Heauen;	1
Whilst	1
like	1
a	1
puft	1
and	1
recklesse	1
Libertine	1
Himselfe,	1
the	1
Primrose	1
path	1
of	1
dalliance	1
treads,	1
And	1
reaks	1
not	1
his	1
owne	1
reade	1
Laer.	1
Oh,	1
feare	1
me	1
not.	1
Enter	1
Polonius.	1
I	1
stay	1
too	1
long;	1
but	1
here	1
my	1
Father	1
comes:	1
A	1
double	1
blessing	1
is	1
a	1
double	1
grace;	1
Occasion	1
smiles	1
vpon	1
a	1
second	1
leaue	1
Polon.	1
Yet	1
heere	1
Laertes?	1
Aboord,	1
aboord	1
for	1
shame,	1
The	1
winde	1
sits	1
in	1
the	1
shoulder	1
of	1
your	1
saile,	1
And	1
you	1
are	1
staid	1
for	1
there:	1
my	1
blessing	1
with	1
you;	1
And	1
these	1
few	1
Precepts	1
in	1
thy	1
memory,	1
See	1
thou	1
Character.	1
Giue	1
thy	1
thoughts	1
no	1
tongue,	1
Nor	1
any	1
vnproportion'd	1
thoughts	1
his	1
Act:	1
Be	1
thou	1
familiar;	1
but	1
by	1
no	1
meanes	1
vulgar:	1
The	1
friends	1
thou	1
hast,	1
and	1
their	1
adoption	1
tride,	1
Grapple	1
them	1
to	1
thy	1
Soule,	1
with	1
hoopes	1
of	1
Steele:	1
But	1
doe	1
not	1
dull	1
thy	1
palme,	1
with	1
entertainment	1
Of	1
each	1
vnhatch't,	1
vnfledg'd	1
Comrade.	1
Beware	1
Of	1
entrance	1
to	1
a	1
quarrell:	1
but	1
being	1
in	1
Bear't	1
that	1
th'	1
opposed	1
may	1
beware	1
of	1
thee.	1
Giue	1
euery	1
man	1
thine	1
eare;	1
but	1
few	1
thy	1
voyce:	1
Take	1
each	1
mans	1
censure;	1
but	1
reserue	1
thy	1
iudgement:	1
Costly	1
thy	1
habit	1
as	1
thy	1
purse	1
can	1
buy;	1
But	1
not	1
exprest	1
in	1
fancie;	1
rich,	1
not	1
gawdie:	1
For	1
the	1
Apparell	1
oft	1
proclaimes	1
the	1
man.	1
And	1
they	1
in	1
France	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
ranck	1
and	1
station,	1
Are	1
of	1
a	1
most	1
select	1
and	1
generous	1
cheff	1
in	1
that.	1
Neither	1
a	1
borrower,	1
nor	1
a	1
lender	1
be;	1
For	1
lone	1
oft	1
loses	1
both	1
it	1
selfe	1
and	1
friend:	1
And	1
borrowing	1
duls	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
Husbandry.	1
This	1
aboue	1
all;	1
to	1
thine	1
owne	1
selfe	1
be	1
true:	1
And	1
it	1
must	1
follow,	1
as	1
the	1
Night	1
the	1
Day,	1
Thou	1
canst	1
not	1
then	1
be	1
false	1
to	1
any	1
man.	1
Farewell:	1
my	1
Blessing	1
season	1
this	1
in	1
thee	1
Laer.	1
Most	1
humbly	1
doe	1
I	1
take	1
my	1
leaue,	1
my	1
Lord	1
Polon.	1
The	1
time	1
inuites	1
you,	1
goe,	1
your	1
seruants	1
tend	1
Laer.	1
Farewell	1
Ophelia,	1
and	1
remember	1
well	1
What	1
I	1
haue	1
said	1
to	1
you	1
Ophe.	1
Tis	1
in	1
my	1
memory	1
lockt,	1
And	1
you	1
your	1
selfe	1
shall	1
keepe	1
the	1
key	1
of	1
it	1
Laer.	1
Farewell.	1
Exit	1
Laer.	1
Polon.	1
What	1
ist	1
Ophelia	1
he	1
hath	1
said	1
to	1
you?	1
Ophe.	1
So	1
please	1
you,	1
somthing	1
touching	1
the	1
L[ord].	1
Hamlet	1
Polon.	1
Marry,	1
well	1
bethought:	1
Tis	1
told	1
me	1
he	1
hath	1
very	1
oft	1
of	1
late	1
Giuen	1
priuate	1
time	1
to	1
you;	1
and	1
you	1
your	1
selfe	1
Haue	1
of	1
your	1
audience	1
beene	1
most	1
free	1
and	1
bounteous.	1
If	1
it	1
be	1
so,	1
as	1
so	1
tis	1
put	1
on	1
me;	1
And	1
that	1
in	1
way	1
of	1
caution:	1
I	1
must	1
tell	1
you,	1
You	1
doe	1
not	1
vnderstand	1
your	1
selfe	1
so	1
cleerely,	1
As	1
it	1
behoues	1
my	1
Daughter,	1
and	1
your	1
Honour.	1
What	1
is	1
betweene	1
you,	1
giue	1
me	1
vp	1
the	1
truth?	1
Ophe.	1
He	1
hath	1
my	1
Lord	1
of	1
late,	1
made	1
many	1
tenders	1
Of	1
his	1
affection	1
to	1
me	1
Polon.	1
Affection,	1
puh.	1
You	1
speake	1
like	1
a	1
greene	1
Girle,	1
Vnsifted	1
in	1
such	1
perillous	1
Circumstance.	1
Doe	1
you	1
beleeue	1
his	1
tenders,	1
as	1
you	1
call	1
them?	1
Ophe.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know,	1
my	1
Lord,	1
what	1
I	1
should	1
thinke	1
Polon.	1
Marry	1
Ile	1
teach	1
you;	1
thinke	1
your	1
selfe	1
a	1
Baby,	1
That	1
you	1
haue	1
tane	1
his	1
tenders	1
for	1
true	1
pay,	1
Which	1
are	1
not	1
starling.	1
Tender	1
your	1
selfe	1
more	1
dearly;	1
Or	1
not	1
to	1
crack	1
the	1
winde	1
of	1
the	1
poore	1
Phrase,	1
Roaming	1
it	1
thus,	1
you'l	1
tender	1
me	1
a	1
foole	1
Ophe.	1
My	1
Lord,	1
he	1
hath	1
importun'd	1
me	1
with	1
loue,	1
In	1
honourable	1
fashion	1
Polon.	1
I,	1
fashion	1
you	1
may	1
call	1
it,	1
go	1
too,	1
go	1
too	1
Ophe.	1
And	1
hath	1
giuen	1
countenance	1
to	1
his	1
speech,	1
My	1
Lord,	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
vowes	1
of	1
Heauen	1
Polon.	1
I,	1
Springes	1
to	1
catch	1
Woodcocks.	1
I	1
doe	1
know	1
When	1
the	1
Bloud	1
burnes,	1
how	1
Prodigall	1
the	1
Soule	1
Giues	1
the	1
tongue	1
vowes:	1
these	1
blazes,	1
Daughter,	1
Giuing	1
more	1
light	1
then	1
heate;	1
extinct	1
in	1
both,	1
Euen	1
in	1
their	1
promise,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
making;	1
You	1
must	1
not	1
take	1
for	1
fire.	1
For	1
this	1
time	1
Daughter,	1
Be	1
somewhat	1
scanter	1
of	1
your	1
Maiden	1
presence;	1
Set	1
your	1
entreatments	1
at	1
a	1
higher	1
rate,	1
Then	1
a	1
command	1
to	1
parley.	1
For	1
Lord	1
Hamlet,	1
Beleeue	1
so	1
much	1
in	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
young,	1
And	1
with	1
a	1
larger	1
tether	1
may	1
he	1
walke,	1
Then	1
may	1
be	1
giuen	1
you.	1
In	1
few,	1
Ophelia,	1
Doe	1
not	1
beleeue	1
his	1
vowes;	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
Broakers,	1
Not	1
of	1
the	1
eye,	1
which	1
their	1
Inuestments	1
show:	1
But	1
meere	1
implorators	1
of	1
vnholy	1
Sutes,	1
Breathing	1
like	1
sanctified	1
and	1
pious	1
bonds,	1
The	1
better	1
to	1
beguile.	1
This	1
is	1
for	1
all:	1
I	1
would	1
not,	1
in	1
plaine	1
tearmes,	1
from	1
this	1
time	1
forth,	1
Haue	1
you	1
so	1
slander	1
any	1
moment	1
leisure,	1
As	1
to	1

Ham.	1
The	1

Hor.	1
It	1

Ham.	1
What	1
hower	1

Hor.	1
I	1

No,	1

Indeed	1

Wherein	1

Keepes	1

And	1

though	1
I	1
am	1
natiue	1
heere,	1
And	1

More	1

That	1

Oh,	1

Let	1

Ignorance;	1
but	1

Why	1

Canoniz'd	1

Hearsed	1

Haue	1

why	1
the	1
Sepulcher	1
Wherein	1
we	1
saw	1
thee	1
quietly	1

Hath	1
op'd	1

To	1

That	1

Reuisits	1
thus	1
the	1

the	1
Moone,	1
Making	1
Night	1
hidious?	1
And	1
we	1
fooles	1
of	1
Nature,	1
So	1
horridly	1
to	1
shake	1
our	1
disposition,	1
With	1
thoughts	1
beyond	1
thee;	1
reaches	1
of	1
our	1
Soules,	1
Say,	1
why	1
is	1
this?	1
wherefore?	1
what	1
should	1
we	1

Ghost	1
beckens	1
Hamlet.	1
Hor.	1
It	1
beckons	1
you	1
to	1
goe	1

with	1

As	1

To	1

Mar.	1
Looke	1
with	1
what	1
courteous	1
action	1
It	1
wafts	1

But	1
doe	1

Hor.	1
No,	1

Ham.	1
It	1

then	1
will	1
I	1

Hor.	1
Doe	1
not	1
my	1

Ham.	1
Why,	1
what	1
should	1
be	1
the	1
feare?	1
I	1
doe	1
not	1
set	1
my	1

And	1
for	1
my	1
Soule,	1
what	1
can	1
it	1
doe	1
to	1
that?	1
Being	1
a	1
thing	1
immortall	1
as	1

It	1
waues	1

forth	1
againe;	1
Ile	1

What	1
if	1

Floud	1

Or	1
to	1
the	1
dreadfull	1
Sonnet	1
of	1
the	1
Cliffe,	1
That	1
beetles	1
o're	1
his	1
base	1
into	1
the	1
Sea,	1
And	1
there	1
assumes	1
some	1
other	1
horrible	1
forme,	1
Which	1
might	1
depriue	1
your	1
Soueraignty	1
of	1
Reason,	1
And	1
draw	1
you	1
into	1
madnesse	1
thinke	1
of	1
it?	1
Ham.	1
It	1
wafts	1
me	1
still:	1
goe	1
on,	1
Ile	1
follow	1

Mar.	1
You	1
shall	1
not	1

Hold	1
off	1
your	1

Hor.	1
Be	1
rul'd,	1
you	1
shall	1

Ham.	1
My	1
fate	1
cries	1
out,	1
And	1
makes	1
each	1
petty	1
Artire	1
in	1
this	1
body,	1
As	1

Nemian	1

Still	1

Vnhand	1

By	1

Ile	1

Exeunt.	1
Ghost	1
&	1
Hamlet.	1
Hor.	1
He	1
waxes	1
desperate	1
with	1
imagination	1
Mar.	1
Let's	1
follow;	1
'tis	1
not	1
fit	1
thus	1
to	1
obey	1
him	1
Hor.	1
Haue	1
after,	1
to	1
what	1

will	1
this	1
come?	1
Mar.	1
Something	1

rotten	1
in	1
the	1
State	1
of	1
Denmarke	1
Hor.	1
Heauen	1
will	1

Mar.	1
Nay,	1
let's	1

Exeunt.	1
Enter	1
Ghost	1
and	1
Hamlet.	1
Ham.	1
Where	1
wilt	1

lead	1
me?	1
speak;	1
Ile	1
go	1
no	1
further	1
Gho.	1
Marke	1
me	1
Ham.	1
I	1
will	1
Gho.	1
My	1
hower	1

almost	1
come,	1
When	1
I	1
to	1
sulphurous	1

tormenting	1
Flames	1
Must	1
render	1

my	1

Ham.	1
Alas	1
poore	1
Ghost	1
Gho.	1
Pitty	1
me	1
not,	1
but	1
lend	1
thy	1
serious	1
hearing	1
To	1
what	1
I	1
shall	1
vnfold	1
Ham.	1
Speake,	1
I	1
am	1
bound	1
to	1
heare	1
Gho.	1
So	1
art	1
thou	1
to	1
reuenge,	1
when	1
thou	1
shalt	1
heare	1
Ham.	1
What?	1
Gho.	1
I	1
am	1
thy	1
Fathers	1
Spirit,	1
Doom'd	1
for	1
a	1
certaine	1
terme	1
to	1
walke	1
the	1
night;	1
And	1
for	1
the	1
day	1
confin'd	1
to	1
fast	1
in	1
Fiers,	1
Till	1
the	1
foule	1
crimes	1
done	1
in	1
my	1
dayes	1
of	1
Nature	1
Are	1
burnt	1
and	1
purg'd	1
away?	1
But	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
forbid	1
To	1
tell	1
the	1
secrets	1
of	1
my	1
Prison-House;	1
I	1
could	1
a	1
Tale	1
vnfold,	1
whose	1
lightest	1
word	1
Would	1
harrow	1
vp	1
thy	1
soule,	1
freeze	1
thy	1
young	1
blood,	1
Make	1
thy	1
two	1
eyes	1
like	1
Starres,	1
start	1
from	1
their	1
Spheres,	1
Thy	1
knotty	1
and	1
combined	1
lockes	1
to	1
part,	1
And	1
each	1
particular	1
haire	1
to	1
stand	1
an	1
end,	1
Like	1
Quilles	1
vpon	1
the	1
fretfull	1
Porpentine:	1
But	1
this	1
eternall	1
blason	1
must	1
not	1
be	1
To	1
eares	1
of	1
flesh	1
and	1
bloud;	1
list	1
Hamlet,	1
oh	1
list,	1
If	1
thou	1
didst	1
euer	1
thy	1
deare	1
Father	1
loue	1
Ham.	1
Oh	1
Heauen!	1
Gho.	1
Reuenge	1

foule	1
and	1
most	1
vnnaturall	1
Murther	1
Ham.	1
Murther?	1
Ghost.	1
Murther	1
most	1
foule,	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
best	1
it	1
is;	1
But	1
this	1
most	1
foule,	1
strange,	1
and	1
vnnaturall	1
Ham.	1
Hast,	1
hast	1
me	1
to	1
know	1
it,	1
That	1
with	1
wings	1
as	1
swift	1
As	1
meditation,	1
or	1
the	1
thoughts	1
of	1
Loue,	1
May	1
sweepe	1
to	1
my	1
Reuenge	1
Ghost.	1
I	1
finde	1
thee	1
apt,	1
And	1
duller	1
should'st	1
thou	1
be	1
then	1
the	1
fat	1
weede	1
That	1
rots	1
it	1
selfe	1
in	1
ease,	1
on	1
Lethe	1
Wharfe,	1
Would'st	1
thou	1
not	1
stirre	1
in	1
this.	1
Now	1
Hamlet	1
heare:	1
It's	1
giuen	1
out,	1
that	1
sleeping	1
in	1
mine	1
Orchard,	1
A	1
Serpent	1
stung	1
me:	1
so	1
the	1
whole	1
eare	1
of	1
Denmarke,	1
Is	1
by	1
a	1
forged	1
processe	1
of	1
my	1
death	1
Rankly	1
abus'd:	1
But	1
know	1
thou	1
Noble	1
youth,	1
The	1
Serpent	1
that	1
did	1
sting	1
thy	1
Fathers	1
life,	1
Now	1
weares	1

Crowne	1
Ham.	1
O	1
my	1
Propheticke	1
soule:	1
mine	1
Vncle?	1
Ghost.	1
I	1
that	1
incestuous,	1
that	1
adulterate	1
Beast	1
With	1
witchcraft	1
of	1
his	1
wits,	1
hath	1
Traitorous	1
guifts.	1
Oh	1
wicked	1
Wit,	1
and	1
Gifts,	1
that	1
haue	1
the	1
power	1
So	1
to	1
seduce?	1
Won	1
to	1
this	1
shamefull	1
Lust	1
The	1
will	1
of	1
my	1
most	1
seeming	1
vertuous	1
Queene:	1
Oh	1
Hamlet,	1
what	1
a	1
falling	1
off	1
was	1
there,	1
From	1
me,	1
whose	1
loue	1
was	1
of	1
that	1
dignity,	1
That	1
it	1
went	1
hand	1
in	1
hand,	1
euen	1
with	1
the	1
Vow	1
I	1
made	1
to	1
her	1
in	1
Marriage;	1
and	1
to	1
decline	1
Vpon	1
a	1
wretch,	1
whose	1
Naturall	1
gifts	1
were	1
poore	1
To	1
those	1
of	1
mine.	1
But	1
Vertue,	1
as	1
it	1
neuer	1
wil	1
be	1
moued,	1
Though	1
Lewdnesse	1
court	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
shape	1
of	1
Heauen:	1
So	1
Lust,	1
though	1
to	1
a	1
radiant	1
Angell	1
link'd,	1
Will	1
sate	1
it	1
selfe	1
in	1
a	1
Celestiall	1
bed,	1
&	1
prey	1
on	1
Garbage.	1
But	1
soft,	1
me	1
thinkes	1
I	1
sent	1
the	1
Mornings	1
Ayre;	1
Briefe	1
let	1
me	1
be:	1
Sleeping	1
within	1
mine	1
Orchard,	1
My	1
custome	1
alwayes	1
in	1
the	1
afternoone;	1
Vpon	1
my	1
secure	1
hower	1
thy	1
Vncle	1
stole	1
With	1
iuyce	1
of	1
cursed	1
Hebenon	1
in	1
a	1
Violl,	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
Porches	1
of	1
mine	1
eares	1
did	1
poure	1
The	1
leaperous	1
Distilment;	1
whose	1
effect	1
Holds	1
such	1
an	1
enmity	1
with	1
bloud	1
of	1
Man,	1
That	1
swift	1
as	1
Quick-siluer,	1
it	1
courses	1
through	1
The	1
naturall	1
Gates	1
and	1
Allies	1
of	1
the	1
body;	1
And	1
with	1
a	1
sodaine	1
vigour	1
it	1
doth	1
posset	1
And	1
curd,	1
like	1
Aygre	1
droppings	1
into	1
Milke,	1
The	1
thin	1
and	1
wholsome	1
blood:	1
so	1
did	1
it	1
mine;	1
And	1
a	1
most	1
instant	1
Tetter	1
bak'd	1
about,	1
Most	1
Lazar-like,	1
with	1
vile	1
and	1
loathsome	1
crust,	1
All	1
my	1
smooth	1
Body.	1
Thus	1
was	1
I,	1
sleeping,	1
by	1
a	1
Brothers	1
hand,	1
Of	1
Life,	1
of	1
Crowne,	1
and	1
Queene	1
at	1
once	1
dispatcht;	1
Cut	1
off	1
euen	1
in	1
the	1
Blossomes	1
of	1
my	1
Sinne,	1
Vnhouzzled,	1
disappointed,	1
vnnaneld,	1
No	1

made,	1
but	1
sent	1
to	1
my	1
account	1
With	1
all	1
my	1
imperfections	1
on	1
my	1
head;	1
Oh	1
horrible	1
Oh	1
horrible,	1
most	1
horrible:	1
If	1
thou	1
hast	1

in	1
thee	1
beare	1

Let	1

A	1

Luxury	1

Incest.	1
But	1
howsoeuer	1

Taint	1
not	1

Against	1

And	1
to	1

To	1

Fare	1

Giue	1

Reynoldo	1
Reynol.	1
I	1
will	1
my	1
Lord	1
Polon.	1
You	1
shall	1
doe	1
maruels	1
wisely:	1
good	1
Reynoldo,	1
Before	1
you	1
visite	1
him	1
you	1
make	1
inquiry	1
Of	1
his	1
behauiour	1
Reynol.	1
My	1
Lord,	1
I	1
did	1
intend	1
it	1
Polon.	1
Marry,	1
well	1
said;	1
Very	1
well	1
said.	1
Looke	1
you	1
Sir,	1
Enquire	1
me	1
first	1
what	1
Danskers	1
are	1
in	1
Paris;	1
And	1
how,	1
and	1
who;	1
what	1
meanes;	1
and	1
where	1
they	1
keepe:	1
What	1
company,	1
at	1
what	1
expence:	1
and	1
finding	1
By	1
this	1
encompassement	1
and	1
drift	1
of	1
question,	1
That	1
they	1
doe	1
know	1
my	1
sonne:	1
Come	1
you	1
more	1
neerer	1
Then	1
your	1
particular	1
demands	1
will	1
touch	1
it,	1
Take	1
you	1
as	1
'twere	1
some	1
distant	1
knowledge	1
of	1
him,	1
And	1
thus	1
I	1
know	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
his	1
friends,	1
And	1
in	1
part	1
him.	1
Doe	1
you	1
marke	1
this	1
Reynoldo?	1
Reynol.	1
I,	1
very	1
well	1
my	1
Lord	1
Polon.	1
And	1
in	1
part	1
him,	1
but	1
you	1
may	1
say	1
not	1
well;	1
But	1
if't	1
be	1
hee	1
I	1
meane,	1
hees	1
very	1
wilde;	1
Addicted	1
so	1
and	1
so;	1
and	1
there	1
put	1
on	1
him	1
What	1
forgeries	1
you	1
please;	1
marry,	1
none	1
so	1
ranke,	1
As	1
may	1
dishonour	1
him;	1
take	1
heed	1
of	1
that:	1
But	1
Sir,	1
such	1
wanton,	1
wild,	1
and	1
vsuall	1
slips,	1
As	1
are	1
Companions	1
noted	1
and	1
most	1
knowne	1
To	1
youth	1
and	1
liberty	1
Reynol.	1
As	1
gaming	1
my	1
Lord	1
Polon.	1
I,	1
or	1
drinking,	1
fencing,	1
swearing,	1
Quarelling,	1
drabbing.	1
You	1
may	1
goe	1
so	1
farre	1
Reynol.	1
My	1
Lord	1
that	1
would	1
dishonour	1
him	1
Polon.	1
Faith	1
no,	1
as	1
you	1
may	1
season	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
charge;	1
You	1
must	1
not	1
put	1
another	1
scandall	1
on	1
him,	1
That	1
hee	1
is	1
open	1
to	1
Incontinencie;	1
That's	1
not	1
my	1
meaning:	1
but	1
breath	1
his	1
faults	1
so	1
quaintly,	1
That	1
they	1
may	1
seeme	1
the	1
taints	1
of	1
liberty;	1
The	1
flash	1
and	1
out-breake	1
of	1
a	1
fiery	1
minde,	1
A	1
sauagenes	1
in	1
vnreclaim'd	1
bloud	1
of	1
generall	1
assault	1
Reynol.	1
But	1
my	1
good	1
Lord	1
Polon.	1
Wherefore	1
should	1
you	1
doe	1
this?	1
Reynol.	1
I	1
my	1
Lord,	1
I	1
would	1
know	1
that	1
Polon.	1
Marry	1
Sir,	1
heere's	1
my	1
drift,	1
And	1
I	1
belieue	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
fetch	1
of	1
warrant:	1
You	1
laying	1
these	1
slight	1
sulleyes	1
on	1
my	1
Sonne,	1
As	1
'twere	1
a	1
thing	1
a	1
little	1
soil'd	1
i'th'	1
working:	1
Marke	1
you	1
your	1
party	1
in	1
conuerse;	1
him	1
you	1
would	1
sound,	1
Hauing	1
euer	1
seene.	1
In	1
the	1
prenominate	1
crimes,	1
The	1
youth	1
you	1
breath	1
of	1
guilty,	1
be	1
assur'd	1
He	1
closes	1
with	1
you	1
in	1
this	1
consequence:	1
Good	1
sir,	1
or	1
so,	1
or	1
friend,	1
or	1
Gentleman.	1
According	1
to	1
the	1
Phrase	1
and	1
the	1
Addition,	1
Of	1
man	1
and	1
Country	1
Reynol.	1
Very	1
good	1
my	1
Lord	1
Polon.	1
And	1
then	1
Sir	1
does	1
he	1
this?	1
He	1
does:	1
what	1
was	1
I	1
about	1
to	1
say?	1
I	1
was	1
about	1
say	1
somthing:	1
where	1
did	1
I	1
leaue?	1
Reynol.	1
At	1
closes	1
in	1
the	1
consequence:	1
At	1
friend,	1
or	1
so,	1
and	1
Gentleman	1
Polon.	1
At	1
closes	1
in	1
the	1
consequence,	1
I	1
marry,	1
He	1
closes	1
with	1
you	1
thus.	1
I	1
know	1
the	1
Gentleman,	1
I	1
saw	1
him	1
yesterday,	1
or	1
tother	1
day;	1
Or	1
then	1
or	1
then,	1
with	1
such	1
and	1
such;	1
and	1
as	1
you	1
say,	1
There	1
was	1
he	1
gaming,	1
there	1
o'retooke	1
in's	1
Rouse,	1
There	1
falling	1
out	1
at	1
Tennis;	1
or	1
perchance,	1
I	1
saw	1
him	1
enter	1
such	1
a	1
house	1
of	1
saile;	1
Videlicet,	1
a	1
Brothell,	1
or	1
so	1
forth.	1
See	1
you	1
now;	1
Your	1
bait	1
of	1
falshood,	1
takes	1
this	1
Cape	1
of	1
truth;	1
And	1
thus	1
doe	1
we	1
of	1
wisedome	1
and	1
of	1
reach	1
With	1
windlesses,	1
and	1
with	1
assaies	1
of	1
Bias,	1
By	1
indirections	1
finde	1
directions	1
out:	1
So	1
by	1
my	1
former	1
Lecture	1
and	1
aduice	1
Shall	1
you	1
my	1
Sonne;	1
you	1
haue	1

not?	1
Reynol.	1
My	1

I	1
haue	1
Polon.	1
God	1
buy	1
you;	1
fare	1
you	1
well	1
Reynol.	1
Good	1

Lord	1
Polon.	1
Obserue	1
his	1
inclination	1
in	1
your	1
selfe	1
Reynol.	1
I	1
shall	1
my	1
Lord	1
Polon.	1
And	1
let	1
him	1
plye	1
his	1
Musicke	1
Reynol.	1
Well,	1
my	1
Lord.	1
Enter.	1
Enter	1
Ophelia.	1
Polon.	1
Farewell:	1
How	1
now	1
Ophelia,	1
what's	1
the	1
matter?	1
Ophe.	1
Alas	1
my	1
Lord,	1
I	1
haue	1
beene	1
so	1
affrighted	1
Polon.	1
With	1
what,	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Heauen?	1
Ophe.	1
My	1
Lord,	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
sowing	1
in	1
my	1
Chamber,	1
Lord	1
Hamlet	1
with	1
his	1
doublet	1
all	1
vnbrac'd,	1
No	1
hat	1
vpon	1
his	1
head,	1
his	1
stockings	1
foul'd,	1
Vngartred,	1
and	1
downe	1
giued	1
to	1
his	1
Anckle,	1
Pale	1
as	1
his	1
shirt,	1
his	1
knees	1
knocking	1
each	1
other,	1
And	1
with	1
a	1
looke	1
so	1
pitious	1
in	1
purport,	1
As	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
loosed	1
out	1
of	1
hell,	1
To	1
speake	1
of	1
horrors:	1
he	1
comes	1
before	1
me	1
Polon.	1
Mad	1
for	1
thy	1
Loue?	1
Ophe.	1
My	1
Lord,	1
I	1
doe	1
not	1
know:	1
but	1
truly	1
I	1
do	1
feare	1
it	1
Polon.	1
What	1
said	1
he?	1
Ophe.	1
He	1
tooke	1
me	1
by	1
the	1
wrist,	1
and	1
held	1
me	1
hard;	1
Then	1
goes	1
he	1
to	1
the	1
length	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
arme;	1
And	1
with	1
his	1
other	1
hand	1
thus	1
o're	1
his	1
brow,	1
He	1
fals	1
to	1
such	1
perusall	1
of	1
my	1
face,	1
As	1
he	1
would	1
draw	1
it.	1
Long	1
staid	1
he	1
so,	1
At	1
last,	1
a	1
little	1
shaking	1
of	1
mine	1
Arme:	1
And	1
thrice	1
his	1
head	1
thus	1
wauing	1
vp	1
and	1
downe;	1
He	1
rais'd	1
a	1
sigh,	1
so	1
pittious	1
and	1
profound,	1
That	1
it	1
did	1
seeme	1
to	1
shatter	1
all	1
his	1
bulke,	1
And	1
end	1
his	1
being.	1
That	1
done,	1
he	1
lets	1
me	1
goe,	1
And	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
ouer	1
his	1
shoulders	1
turn'd,	1
He	1
seem'd	1
to	1
finde	1
his	1
way	1
without	1
his	1
eyes,	1
For	1
out	1
adores	1
he	1
went	1
without	1
their	1
helpe;	1
And	1
to	1
the	1
last,	1
bended	1
their	1
light	1
on	1
me	1
Polon.	1
Goe	1
with	1
me,	1
I	1
will	1
goe	1
seeke	1
the	1
King,	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
very	1
extasie	1
of	1
Loue,	1
Whose	1
violent	1
property	1
foredoes	1
it	1
selfe,	1
And	1
leads	1
the	1
will	1
to	1
desperate	1
Vndertakings,	1
As	1
oft	1
as	1
any	1
passion	1
vnder	1
Heauen,	1
That	1
does	1
afflict	1
our	1
Natures.	1
I	1
am	1
sorrie,	1
What	1
haue	1
you	1
giuen	1
him	1
any	1
hard	1
words	1

No	1

This	1

My	1
Liege,	1
and	1
Madam,	1
to	1
expostulate	1
What	1
Maiestie	1
should	1
be,	1
what	1
Dutie	1
is,	1
Why	1
day	1
is	1
day;	1
night,	1
night;	1
and	1
time	1
is	1
time,	1
Were	1
nothing	1
but	1
to	1
waste	1
Night,	1
Day,	1
and	1
Time.	1
Therefore,	1
since	1
Breuitie	1
is	1
the	1
Soule	1
of	1
Wit,	1
And	1
tediousnesse,	1
the	1
limbes	1
and	1
outward	1
flourishes,	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
breefe.	1
Your	1
Noble	1
Sonne	1
is	1
mad:	1
Mad	1
call	1
I	1
it;	1
for	1
to	1
define	1
true	1
Madnesse,	1
What	1
is't,	1
but	1
to	1
be	1
nothing	1
else	1
but	1
mad.	1
But	1
let	1
that	1
go	1
Qu.	1
More	1
matter,	1
with	1
lesse	1
Art	1
Pol.	1
Madam,	1
I	1
sweare	1
I	1
vse	1
no	1
Art	1
at	1
all:	1
That	1
he	1
is	1
mad,	1
'tis	1
true:	1
'Tis	1
true	1
'tis	1
pittie,	1
And	1
pittie	1
it	1
is	1
true:	1
A	1
foolish	1
figure,	1
But	1
farewell	1
it:	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
vse	1
no	1
Art.	1
Mad	1
let	1
vs	1
grant	1
him	1
then:	1
and	1
now	1
remaines	1
That	1
we	1
finde	1
out	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
this	1
effect,	1
Or	1
rather	1
say,	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
this	1
defect;	1
For	1
this	1
effect	1
defectiue,	1
comes	1
by	1
cause,	1
Thus	1
it	1
remaines,	1
and	1
the	1
remainder	1
thus.	1
Perpend,	1
I	1
haue	1
a	1
daughter:	1

The	1

To	1
the	1
Celestiall,	1
and	1
my	1
Soules	1
Idoll,	1
the	1
most	1
beautifed	1
Ophelia.	1
That's	1
an	1
ill	1
Phrase,	1
a	1
vilde	1
Phrase,	1
beautified	1
is	1
a	1
vilde	1
Phrase:	1
but	1
you	1
shall	1
heare	1
these	1
in	1

Qu.	1
Came	1

Good	1

Doubt	1
thou,	1
the	1
Starres	1

Doubt,	1
that	1

Doubt	1
Truth	1

But	1

O	1

Numbers:	1
I	1

Best	1
beleeue	1

Adieu.	1
Thine	1

This	1

Obedience	1
hath	1
my	1

shew'd	1
me:	1
And	1
more	1
aboue	1
hath	1
his	1
soliciting,	1
As	1
they	1

by	1
Time,	1
by	1
Meanes,	1
and	1
Place,	1
All	1
giuen	1
to	1
mine	1
eare	1
King.	1
But	1
how	1
hath	1
she	1
receiu'd	1
his	1
Loue?	1
Pol.	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
thinke	1
of	1
me?	1
King.	1
As	1
of	1
a	1
man,	1
faithfull	1
and	1
Honourable	1
Pol.	1
I	1
wold	1
faine	1
proue	1
so.	1
But	1
what	1
might	1
you	1
think?	1
When	1
I	1
had	1
seene	1
this	1
hot	1
loue	1
on	1
the	1
wing,	1
As	1
I	1
perceiued	1
it,	1
I	1
must	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
Before	1
my	1
Daughter	1
told	1
me	1
what	1
might	1
you	1
Or	1
my	1
deere	1
Maiestie	1
your	1
Queene	1
heere,	1
think,	1
If	1
I	1
had	1
playd	1
the	1
Deske	1
or	1
Table-booke,	1
Or	1
giuen	1
my	1
heart	1
a	1
winking,	1
mute	1
and	1
dumbe,	1
Or	1
look'd	1
vpon	1
this	1
Loue,	1
with	1
idle	1
sight,	1
What	1
might	1
you	1
thinke?	1
No,	1
I	1
went	1
round	1
to	1
worke,	1
And	1
(my	1
yong	1
Mistris)	1
thus	1
I	1
did	1
bespeake	1
Lord	1
Hamlet	1
is	1
a	1
Prince	1
out	1
of	1
thy	1
Starre,	1
This	1
must	1
not	1
be:	1
and	1
then,	1
I	1
Precepts	1
gaue	1
her,	1
That	1
she	1
should	1
locke	1
her	1
selfe	1
from	1
his	1
Resort,	1
Admit	1
no	1
Messengers,	1
receiue	1
no	1
Tokens:	1
Which	1
done,	1
she	1
tooke	1
the	1
Fruites	1
of	1
my	1
Aduice,	1
And	1
he	1
repulsed.	1
A	1
short	1
Tale	1
to	1
make,	1
Fell	1
into	1
a	1
Sadnesse,	1
then	1
into	1
a	1
Fast,	1
Thence	1
to	1
a	1
Watch,	1
thence	1
into	1
a	1
Weaknesse,	1
Thence	1
to	1
a	1
Lightnesse,	1
and	1
by	1
this	1
declension	1
Into	1
the	1
Madnesse	1
whereon	1
now	1
he	1
raues,	1
And	1
all	1
we	1
waile	1
for	1
King.	1
Do	1
you	1
thinke	1
'tis	1
this?	1
Qu.	1
It	1
may	1
be	1
very	1
likely	1
Pol.	1
Hath	1
there	1
bene	1
such	1
a	1
time,	1
I'de	1
fain	1
know	1
that,	1
That	1
I	1
haue	1
possitiuely	1
said,	1
'tis	1
so,	1
When	1
it	1
prou'd	1
otherwise?	1
King.	1
Not	1
that	1
I	1
know	1
Pol.	1
Take	1
this	1
from	1
this;	1
if	1
this	1
be	1
otherwise,	1
If	1
Circumstances	1
leade	1
me,	1
I	1
will	1
finde	1
Where	1
truth	1
is	1
hid,	1
though	1
it	1
were	1
hid	1
indeede	1
Within	1
the	1
Center	1
King.	1
How	1
may	1
we	1
try	1
it	1
further?	1
Pol.	1
You	1
know	1
sometimes	1
He	1
walkes	1
foure	1
houres	1
together,	1
heere	1
In	1
the	1
Lobby	1
Qu.	1
So	1
he	1
ha's	1
indeed	1
Pol.	1
At	1
such	1
a	1
time	1
Ile	1
loose	1
my	1
Daughter	1
to	1
him,	1
Be	1
you	1
and	1
I	1
behinde	1
an	1
Arras	1
then,	1
Marke	1
the	1
encounter:	1
If	1
he	1
loue	1
her	1
not,	1
And	1
be	1
not	1
from	1
his	1
reason	1
falne	1
thereon;	1
Let	1
me	1
be	1
no	1
Assistant	1
for	1
a	1
State,	1
And	1
keepe	1
a	1
Farme	1
and	1
Carters	1
King.	1
We	1
will	1

it.	1
Enter	1

Well,	1

Do	1

Not	1

Then	1

Honest,	1

Ham.	1
I	1

pick'd	1
out	1

two	1
thousand	1
Pol.	1
That's	1
very	1
true,	1
my	1

For	1

Let	1

How	1

Still	1

not	1

said	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
Fishmonger:	1

farre	1
gone:	1
and	1
truly	1

I	1

All	1

yet	1
I	1
holde	1
it	1
not	1
Honestie	1

For	1
you	1

Sir,	1
should	1
be	1

if	1

Though	1

Yet	1

will	1

Out	1

Into	1

Indeed	1

How	1

A	1

That	1

Madnesse	1

Which	1

Take	1

You	1

My	1

How	1

Guildensterne?	1
Oh,	1
Rosincrane;	1

How	1

Rosin.	1
As	1
the	1
indifferent	1
Children	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
Guild.	1
Happy,	1
in	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
ouer-happy:	1
on	1
Fortunes	1
Cap,	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
the	1
very	1
Button	1
Ham.	1
Nor	1
the	1
Soales	1
of	1
her	1
Shoo?	1
Rosin.	1
Neither	1
my	1

Then	1
you	1
liue	1
about	1
her	1
waste,	1
or	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
her	1
fauour?	1
Guil.	1
Faith,	1
her	1
priuates,	1
we	1
Ham.	1
In	1
the	1
secret	1
parts	1
of	1
Fortune?	1
Oh,	1
most	1
true:	1
she	1
is	1
a	1
Strumpet.	1
What's	1
the	1
newes?	1
Rosin.	1
None	1
my	1
Lord;	1
but	1
that	1
the	1
World's	1
growne	1
honest	1
Ham.	1
Then	1
is	1
Doomesday	1
neere:	1
But	1
your	1
newes	1
is	1
not	1
true.	1
Let	1
me	1
question	1
more	1
in	1
particular:	1
what	1
haue	1
you	1
my	1
good	1
friends,	1
deserued	1
at	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
Fortune,	1
that	1
she	1
sends	1
you	1
to	1
Prison	1
hither?	1
Guil.	1
Prison,	1
my	1
Lord?	1
Ham.	1
Denmark's	1
a	1
Prison	1
Rosin.	1
Then	1
is	1
the	1
World	1
one	1
Ham.	1
A	1
goodly	1
one,	1
in	1
which	1
there	1
are	1
many	1
Confines,	1
Wards,	1
and	1
Dungeons;	1
Denmarke	1
being	1
one	1
o'th'	1
worst	1
Rosin.	1
We	1
thinke	1
not	1
so	1
my	1
Lord	1
Ham.	1
Why	1
then	1
'tis	1
none	1
to	1
you;	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
either	1
good	1
or	1
bad,	1
but	1
thinking	1
makes	1
it	1
so:	1
to	1
me	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
prison	1
Rosin.	1
Why	1
then	1
your	1
Ambition	1
makes	1
it	1
one:	1
'tis	1
too	1
narrow	1
for	1
your	1
minde	1
Ham.	1
O	1
God,	1
I	1
could	1
be	1
bounded	1
in	1
a	1
nutshell,	1
and	1
count	1
my	1
selfe	1
a	1
King	1
of	1
infinite	1
space;	1
were	1
it	1
not	1
that	1
I	1
haue	1
bad	1
dreames	1
Guil.	1
Which	1
dreames	1
indeed	1
are	1
Ambition:	1
for	1
the	1
very	1
substance	1
of	1
the	1
Ambitious,	1
is	1
meerely	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
a	1
Dreame	1
Ham.	1
A	1
dreame	1
it	1
selfe	1
is	1
but	1
a	1
shadow	1
Rosin.	1
Truely,	1
and	1
I	1
hold	1
Ambition	1
of	1
so	1
ayry	1
and	1
light	1
a	1
quality,	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
but	1
a	1
shadowes	1
shadow	1
Ham.	1
Then	1
are	1
our	1
Beggers	1
bodies;	1
and	1
our	1
Monarchs	1
and	1
out-stretcht	1
Heroes	1
the	1
Beggers	1
Shadowes:	1
shall	1
wee	1
to	1
th'	1
Court:	1
for,	1
by	1
my	1
fey	1
I	1
cannot	1
reason?	1
Both.	1
Wee'l	1
wait	1
vpon	1
you	1
Ham.	1
No	1
such	1
matter.	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
sort	1
you	1
with	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
my	1
seruants:	1
for	1
to	1
speake	1
to	1
you	1
like	1
an	1
honest	1
man:	1
I	1
am	1
most	1
dreadfully	1
attended;	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
beaten	1
way	1
of	1
friendship,	1
What	1
make	1
you	1
at	1
Elsonower?	1
Rosin.	1
To	1
visit	1
you	1
my	1
Lord,	1
no	1
other	1
occasion	1
Ham.	1
Begger	1
that	1
I	1
am,	1
I	1
am	1
euen	1
poore	1
in	1
thankes;	1
but	1
I	1
thanke	1
you:	1
and	1
sure	1
deare	1
friends	1
my	1
thanks	1
are	1
too	1
deare	1
a	1
halfepeny;	1
were	1
you	1
not	1
sent	1
for?	1
Is	1
it	1
your	1
owne	1
inclining?	1
Is	1
it	1
a	1
free	1
visitation?	1
Come,	1
deale	1
iustly	1
with	1
me:	1
come,	1
come;	1
nay	1
speake	1
Guil.	1
What	1
should	1
we	1
say	1
my	1
Lord?	1
Ham.	1
Why	1
any	1
thing.	1
But	1
to	1
the	1
purpose;	1
you	1
were	1
sent	1
for;	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
kinde	1
confession	1
in	1
your	1
lookes;	1
which	1
your	1
modesties	1
haue	1
not	1
craft	1
enough	1
to	1
color,	1
I	1
know	1
the	1
good	1
King	1
&	1
Queene	1
haue	1
sent	1
for	1
you	1
Rosin.	1
To	1
what	1
end	1
my	1
Lord?	1
Ham.	1
That	1
you	1
must	1
teach	1
me:	1
but	1
let	1
mee	1
coniure	1
you	1
by	1
the	1
rights	1
of	1
our	1
fellowship,	1
by	1
the	1
consonancy	1
of	1
our	1
youth,	1
by	1
the	1
Obligation	1
of	1
our	1
euer-preserued	1
loue,	1
and	1
by	1
what	1
more	1
deare,	1
a	1
better	1
proposer	1
could	1
charge	1
you	1
withall;	1
be	1
euen	1
and	1
direct	1
with	1
me,	1
whether	1
you	1
were	1
sent	1
for	1
or	1
no	1
Rosin.	1
What	1
say	1
you?	1
Ham.	1
Nay	1
then	1
I	1
haue	1
an	1
eye	1
of	1
you:	1
if	1
you	1
loue	1
me	1
hold	1
not	1
off	1
Guil.	1
My	1
Lord,	1
we	1
were	1
sent	1
for	1
Ham.	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
you	1
why;	1
so	1
shall	1
my	1
anticipation	1
preuent	1
your	1
discouery	1
of	1
your	1
secricie	1
to	1
the	1
King	1
and	1
Queene:	1
moult	1
no	1
feather,	1
I	1
haue	1
of	1
late,	1
but	1
wherefore	1
I	1
know	1
not,	1
lost	1
all	1
my	1
mirth,	1
forgone	1
all	1
custome	1
of	1
exercise;	1
and	1
indeed,	1
it	1
goes	1
so	1
heauenly	1
with	1
my	1
disposition;	1
that	1
this	1
goodly	1
frame	1
the	1
Earth,	1
seemes	1
to	1
me	1
a	1
sterrill	1
Promontory;	1
this	1
most	1
excellent	1
Canopy	1
the	1
Ayre,	1
look	1
you,	1
this	1
braue	1
ore-hanging,	1
this	1
Maiesticall	1
Roofe,	1
fretted	1
with	1
golden	1
fire:	1
why,	1
it	1
appeares	1
no	1
other	1
thing	1
to	1
mee,	1
then	1
a	1
foule	1
and	1
pestilent	1
congregation	1
of	1
vapours.	1
What	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
worke	1
is	1
a	1
man!	1
how	1
Noble	1
in	1
Reason?	1
how	1
infinite	1
in	1
faculty?	1
in	1
forme	1
and	1
mouing	1
how	1
expresse	1
and	1
admirable?	1
in	1
Action,	1
how	1
like	1
an	1
Angel?	1
in	1
apprehension,	1
how	1
like	1
a	1
God?	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
the	1
Parragon	1
of	1
Animals;	1
and	1
yet	1
to	1
me,	1
what	1
is	1
this	1
Quintessence	1
of	1
Dust?	1
Man	1
delights	1
not	1
me;	1
no,	1
nor	1
Woman	1
neither;	1
though	1
by	1
your	1
smiling	1
you	1
seeme	1
to	1
say	1
so	1
Rosin.	1
My	1
Lord,	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
such	1
stuffe	1
in	1
my	1
thoughts	1
Ham.	1
Why	1
did	1
you	1
laugh,	1
when	1
I	1
said,	1
Man	1
delights	1
not	1
me?	1
Rosin.	1
To	1
thinke,	1
my	1
Lord,	1
if	1
you	1
delight	1
not	1
in	1
Man,	1
what	1
Lenton	1
entertainment	1
the	1
Players	1
shall	1
receiue	1
from	1
you:	1
wee	1
coated	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
way,	1
and	1
hither	1
are	1
they	1
comming	1
to	1
offer	1
you	1
Seruice	1
Ham.	1
He	1
that	1
playes	1
the	1
King	1
shall	1
be	1
welcome;	1
his	1
Maiesty	1
shall	1
haue	1
Tribute	1
of	1
mee:	1
the	1
aduenturous	1
Knight	1
shal	1
vse	1
his	1
Foyle	1
and	1
Target:	1
the	1
Louer	1
shall	1
not	1
sigh	1
gratis,	1
the	1
humorous	1
man	1
shall	1
end	1
his	1
part	1
in	1
peace:	1
the	1
Clowne	1
shall	1
make	1
those	1
laugh	1
whose	1
lungs	1
are	1
tickled	1
a'th'	1
sere:	1
and	1
the	1
Lady	1
shall	1
say	1
her	1
minde	1
freely;	1
or	1
the	1
blanke	1
Verse	1
shall	1
halt	1
for't:	1
what	1
Players	1
are	1
they?	1
Rosin.	1
Euen	1
those	1
you	1
were	1
wont	1
to	1
take	1
delight	1
in	1
the	1
Tragedians	1
of	1
the	1
City	1
Ham.	1
How	1
chances	1
it	1
they	1
trauaile?	1
their	1
residence	1
both	1
in	1
reputation	1
and	1
profit	1
was	1
better	1
both	1
wayes	1
Rosin.	1
I	1
thinke	1
their	1
Inhibition	1
comes	1
by	1
the	1
meanes	1
of	1
the	1
late	1
Innouation?	1
Ham.	1
Doe	1
they	1
hold	1
the	1
same	1
estimation	1
they	1
did	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
City?	1
Are	1
they	1
so	1
follow'd?	1
Rosin.	1
No	1
indeed,	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
Ham.	1
How	1
comes	1
it?	1
doe	1
they	1
grow	1
rusty?	1
Rosin.	1
Nay,	1
their	1
indeauour	1
keepes	1
in	1
the	1
wonted	1
pace;	1
But	1
there	1
is	1
Sir	1
an	1
ayrie	1
of	1
Children,	1
little	1
Yases,	1
that	1
crye	1
out	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
question;	1
and	1
are	1
most	1
tyrannically	1
clap't	1
for't:	1
these	1
are	1
now	1
the	1
fashion,	1
and	1
so	1
be-ratled	1
the	1
common	1
Stages	1
(so	1
they	1
call	1
them)	1
that	1
many	1
wearing	1
Rapiers,	1
are	1
affraide	1
of	1
Goose-quils,	1
and	1
dare	1
scarse	1
come	1
thither	1
Ham.	1
What	1
are	1
they	1
Children?	1
Who	1
maintains	1
'em?	1
How	1
are	1
they	1
escorted?	1
Will	1
they	1
pursue	1
the	1
Quality	1
no	1
longer	1
then	1
they	1
can	1
sing?	1
Will	1
they	1
not	1
say	1
afterwards	1
if	1
they	1
should	1
grow	1
themselues	1
to	1
common	1
Players	1
(as	1
it	1
is	1
most	1
like	1
if	1
their	1
meanes	1
are	1
not	1
better)	1
their	1
Writers	1
do	1
them	1
wrong,	1
to	1
make	1
them	1
exclaim	1
against	1
their	1
owne	1
Succession	1
Rosin.	1
Faith	1
there	1
ha's	1
bene	1
much	1
to	1
do	1
on	1
both	1
sides:	1
and	1
the	1
Nation	1
holds	1
it	1
no	1
sinne,	1
to	1
tarre	1
them	1
to	1
Controuersie.	1
There	1
was	1
for	1
a	1
while,	1
no	1

I	1
receiu'd	1

others,	1
whose	1
iudgement	1
in	1
such	1

cried	1

an	1

digested	1
in	1
the	1

was	1
no	1

One	1

cheefely	1
lou'd,	1
'twas	1
Aeneas	1

and	1
thereabout	1

where	1
he	1

If	1

begin	1
at	1
this	1
Line,	1
let	1
me	1
see,	1
let	1
me	1
see:	1
The	1
rugged	1
Pyrrhus	1
like	1
th'Hyrcanian	1
Beast.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
so:	1
it	1
begins	1
with	1
Pyrrhus	1
The	1
rugged	1
Pyrrhus,	1
he	1
whose	1
Sable	1
Armes	1
Blacke	1
as	1
his	1
purpose,	1
did	1
the	1

resemble	1
When	1

Hath	1

horridly	1
Trick'd	1
With	1

of	1
Fathers,	1

Bak'd	1

damned	1
light	1
To	1
their	1
vilde	1
Murthers,	1
roasted	1
in	1
wrath	1
and	1
fire,	1
And	1
thus	1
o're-sized	1
with	1
coagulate	1
gore,	1
With	1
eyes	1
like	1
Carbuncles,	1
the	1
hellish	1

in	1
Rage	1

But	1
with	1
the	1

Th'	1

Seeming	1

For	1

Which	1

Of	1

seem'd	1
i'th'	1

So	1
as	1
a	1

Tyrant	1
Pyrrhus	1
stood,	1
And	1
like	1
a	1
Newtrall	1
to	1
his	1

did	1
nothing.	1
But	1
as	1
we	1
often	1

against	1

A	1

in	1

Heauens,	1

The	1

As	1

So	1
after	1
Pyrrhus	1
pause,	1
A	1
rowsed	1
Vengeance	1
sets	1
him	1
new	1
a-worke,	1
And	1
neuer	1

On	1

forg'd	1

With	1

Now	1

monstrous	1
that	1
this	1
Player	1
heere,	1
But	1
in	1
a	1
Fixion,	1
in	1
a	1
dreame	1
of	1
Passion,	1
Could	1
force	1
his	1
soule	1
so	1
to	1
his	1
whole	1
conceit,	1
That	1
from	1
her	1
working,	1
all	1
his	1
visage	1
warm'd;	1
Teares	1
in	1
his	1
eyes,	1
distraction	1
in's	1
Aspect,	1
A	1
broken	1
voyce,	1
and	1
his	1
whole	1
Function	1
suiting	1
With	1
Formes,	1
to	1
his	1
Conceit?	1
And	1
all	1
for	1
nothing?	1
For	1
Hecuba?	1
What's	1
Hecuba	1
to	1
him,	1
or	1
he	1
to	1
Hecuba,	1
That	1
he	1
should	1
weepe	1
for	1
her?	1
What	1
would	1
he	1
doe,	1
Had	1
he	1
the	1
Motiue	1
and	1
the	1
Cue	1
for	1
passion	1
That	1
I	1
haue?	1
He	1
would	1
drowne	1
the	1
Stage	1
with	1
teares,	1
And	1
cleaue	1
the	1
generall	1
eare	1
with	1
horrid	1
speech:	1
Make	1
mad	1
the	1
guilty,	1
and	1
apale	1
the	1
free,	1
Confound	1
the	1
ignorant,	1
and	1
amaze	1
indeed,	1
The	1
very	1
faculty	1
of	1
Eyes	1
and	1
Eares.	1
Yet	1
I,	1
A	1
dull	1
and	1
muddy-metled	1
Rascall,	1
peake	1
Like	1
Iohn	1
a-dreames,	1
vnpregnant	1
of	1
my	1
cause,	1
And	1
can	1
say	1
nothing:	1
No,	1
not	1
for	1
a	1
King,	1
Vpon	1
whose	1
property,	1
and	1
most	1
deere	1
life,	1
A	1
damn'd	1

was	1

Am	1

Coward?	1
Who	1

Villaine?	1

Pluckes	1
off	1

As	1

Who	1

Ha?	1
Why	1
I	1
should	1
take	1
it:	1
for	1
it	1
cannot	1

But	1
I	1
am	1
Pigeon-Liuer'd,	1
and	1
lacke	1
Gall	1
To	1
make	1
Oppression	1
bitter,	1
or	1
ere	1
this,	1
I	1
should	1
haue	1
fatted	1
all	1
the	1
Region	1
Kites	1
With	1
this	1
Slaues	1
Offall,	1
bloudy:	1
a	1
Bawdy	1
villaine,	1
Remorselesse,	1
Treacherous,	1
Letcherous,	1
kindles	1
villaine!	1
Oh	1
Vengeance!	1
Who?	1
What	1
an	1
Asse	1
am	1
I?	1
I	1
sure,	1
this	1
is	1
most	1
braue,	1
That	1
I,	1
the	1
Sonne	1
of	1
the	1
Deere	1
murthered,	1
Prompted	1
to	1
my	1
Reuenge	1
by	1
Heauen,	1
and	1
Hell,	1
Must	1
(like	1
a	1
Whore)	1
vnpacke	1
my	1
heart	1
with	1
words,	1
And	1
fall	1
a	1
Cursing	1
like	1
a	1
very	1
Drab.	1
A	1
Scullion?	1
Fye	1
vpon't:	1
Foh.	1
About	1
my	1
Braine.	1
I	1
haue	1
heard,	1
that	1
guilty	1
Creatures	1
sitting	1
at	1
a	1
Play,	1
Haue	1
by	1
the	1
very	1
cunning	1
of	1
the	1
Scoene,	1
Bene	1
strooke	1
so	1
to	1
the	1
soule,	1
that	1
presently	1
They	1
haue	1
proclaim'd	1
their	1
Malefactions.	1
For	1
Murther,	1
though	1
it	1
haue	1
no	1
tongue,	1
will	1
speake	1
With	1
most	1
myraculous	1
Organ.	1
Ile	1
haue	1
these	1
Players,	1
Play	1
something	1
like	1
the	1
murder	1
of	1
my	1
Father,	1
Before	1
mine	1
Vnkle.	1
Ile	1
obserue	1
his	1
lookes,	1
Ile	1
rent	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
quicke:	1
If	1
he	1
but	1
blench	1
I	1
know	1
my	1
course.	1
The	1
Spirit	1
that	1
I	1
haue	1
seene	1
May	1
be	1
the	1
Diuell,	1
and	1
the	1
Diuel	1
hath	1
power	1
T'	1
assume	1
a	1
pleasing	1
shape,	1
yea	1
and	1
perhaps	1
Out	1
of	1
my	1
Weaknesse,	1
and	1
my	1
Melancholly,	1
As	1
he	1
is	1
very	1
potent	1
with	1
such	1
Spirits,	1
Abuses	1
me	1
to	1
damne	1
me.	1
Ile	1
haue	1
grounds	1
More	1
Relatiue	1
then	1
this:	1
The	1
Play's	1
the	1
thing,	1
Wherein	1
Ile	1
catch	1
the	1
Conscience	1
of	1
the	1
King.	1
Exit	1
Enter	1
King,	1
Queene,	1
Polonius,	1
Ophelia,	1
Rosincrance,	1
Guildenstern,	1
and	1
Lords.	1
King.	1
And	1
can	1
you	1
by	1
no	1
drift	1
of	1
circumstance	1
Get	1
from	1
him	1
why	1
he	1
puts	1
on	1
this	1
Confusion:	1
Grating	1
so	1
harshly	1
all	1
his	1
dayes	1
of	1
quiet	1
With	1
turbulent	1
and	1
dangerous	1
Lunacy	1
Rosin.	1
He	1
does	1
confesse	1
he	1
feeles	1
himselfe	1
distracted,	1
But	1
from	1
what	1
cause	1
he	1
will	1
by	1
no	1
meanes	1
speake	1
Guil.	1
Nor	1
do	1
we	1
finde	1
him	1
forward	1
to	1
be	1
sounded,	1
But	1
with	1
a	1
crafty	1
Madnesse	1
keepes	1
aloofe:	1
When	1
we	1
would	1
bring	1
him	1
on	1
to	1
some	1
Confession	1
Of	1
his	1
true	1
state	1
Qu.	1
Did	1
he	1
receiue	1
you	1
well?	1
Rosin.	1
Most	1
like	1
a	1
Gentleman	1
Guild.	1
But	1
with	1
much	1
forcing	1
of	1
his	1
disposition	1
Rosin.	1
Niggard	1
of	1
question,	1
but	1
of	1
our	1
demands	1
Most	1
free	1
in	1
his	1
reply	1
Qu.	1
Did	1
you	1
assay	1
him	1
to	1
any	1
pastime?	1
Rosin.	1
Madam,	1
it	1
so	1
fell	1
out,	1
that	1
certaine	1
Players	1
We	1
ore-wrought	1
on	1
the	1
way:	1
of	1
these	1
we	1
told	1
him,	1
And	1
there	1
did	1
seeme	1
in	1
him	1
a	1
kinde	1
of	1
ioy	1
To	1
heare	1
of	1
it:	1
They	1
are	1
about	1
the	1
Court,	1
And	1
(as	1
I	1
thinke)	1
they	1
haue	1
already	1
order	1
This	1
night	1
to	1
play	1
before	1
him	1
Pol.	1
'Tis	1
most	1
true:	1
And	1
he	1
beseech'd	1
me	1
to	1
intreate	1
your	1
Maiesties	1
To	1
heare,	1
and	1
see	1
the	1
matter	1
King.	1
With	1
all	1
my	1
heart,	1
and	1
it	1
doth	1
much	1
content	1
me	1
To	1
heare	1
him	1
so	1
inclin'd.	1
Good	1
Gentlemen,	1
Giue	1
him	1
a	1
further	1
edge,	1
and	1
driue	1
his	1
purpose	1
on	1
To	1
these	1
delights	1
Rosin.	1
We	1
shall	1
my	1
Lord.	1
Exeunt.	1
King.	1
Sweet	1
Gertrude	1
leaue	1
vs	1
too,	1
For	1
we	1
haue	1
closely	1
sent	1
for	1
Hamlet	1
hither,	1
That	1
he,	1
as	1
'twere	1
by	1
accident,	1
may	1
there	1
Affront	1
Ophelia.	1
Her	1
Father,	1
and	1
my	1
selfe	1
(lawful	1
espials)	1
Will	1
so	1
bestow	1
our	1
selues,	1
that	1
seeing	1
vnseene	1
We	1
may	1
of	1
their	1
encounter	1
frankely	1
iudge,	1
And	1
gather	1
by	1
him,	1
as	1
he	1
is	1
behaued,	1
If't	1
be	1
th'	1
affliction	1
of	1
his	1
loue,	1
or	1
no.	1
That	1
thus	1
he	1
suffers	1
for	1
Qu.	1
I	1
shall	1
obey	1
you,	1
And	1
for	1
your	1
part	1
Ophelia,	1
I	1
do	1
wish	1
That	1
your	1
good	1
Beauties	1
be	1
the	1
happy	1
cause	1
Of	1
Hamlets	1
wildenesse:	1
so	1
shall	1
I	1
hope	1
your	1
Vertues	1
Will	1
bring	1
him	1
to	1
his	1
wonted	1
way	1
againe,	1
To	1
both	1
your	1
Honors	1
Ophe.	1
Madam,	1
I	1
wish	1
it	1
may	1
Pol.	1
Ophelia,	1
walke	1
you	1
heere.	1
Gracious	1
so	1
please	1
ye	1
We	1
will	1
bestow	1
our	1
selues:	1
Reade	1
on	1
this	1
booke,	1
That	1
shew	1
of	1
such	1
an	1
exercise	1
may	1
colour	1
Your	1
lonelinesse.	1
We	1
are	1
oft	1
too	1
blame	1
in	1
this,	1
'Tis	1
too	1
much	1
prou'd,	1
that	1
with	1
Deuotions	1
visage,	1
And	1
pious	1
Action,	1
we	1
do	1
surge	1
o're	1
The	1
diuell	1
himselfe	1
King.	1
Oh	1
'tis	1
true:	1
How	1
smart	1
a	1
lash	1
that	1
speech	1
doth	1
giue	1
my	1
Conscience?	1
The	1
Harlots	1
Cheeke	1
beautied	1
with	1
plaist'ring	1
Art	1
Is	1
not	1
more	1
vgly	1
to	1
the	1
thing	1
that	1
helpes	1
it,	1
Then	1
is	1
my	1
deede,	1
to	1
my	1
most	1
painted	1
word.	1
Oh	1
heauie	1
burthen!	1
Pol.	1
I	1
heare	1
him	1
comming,	1
let's	1
withdraw	1
my	1
Lord.	1
Exeunt.	1
Enter	1
Hamlet.	1
Ham.	1
To	1
be,	1
or	1
not	1
to	1
be,	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
Question:	1
Whether	1
'tis	1
Nobler	1
in	1
the	1
minde	1
to	1
suffer	1
The	1
Slings	1
and	1
Arrowes	1
of	1
outragious	1
Fortune,	1
Or	1
to	1
take	1
Armes	1
against	1
a	1
Sea	1
of	1
troubles,	1
And	1
by	1
opposing	1
end	1
them:	1
to	1
dye,	1
to	1
sleepe	1
No	1
more;	1
and	1
by	1
a	1
sleepe,	1
to	1
say	1
we	1
end	1
The	1
Heart-ake,	1
and	1
the	1
thousand	1
Naturall	1
shockes	1
That	1
Flesh	1
is	1
heyre	1
too?	1
'Tis	1
a	1
consummation	1
Deuoutly	1
to	1
be	1
wish'd.	1
To	1
dye	1
to	1
sleepe,	1
To	1
sleepe,	1
perchance	1
to	1
Dreame;	1
I,	1
there's	1
the	1
rub,	1
For	1
in	1
that	1
sleepe	1
of	1
death,	1
what	1
dreames	1
may	1
come,	1
When	1
we	1
haue	1
shuffel'd	1
off	1
this	1
mortall	1
coile,	1
Must	1
giue	1
vs	1
pawse.	1
There's	1
the	1
respect	1
That	1
makes	1
Calamity	1
of	1
so	1
long	1
life:	1
For	1
who	1
would	1
beare	1
the	1
Whips	1
and	1
Scornes	1
of	1
time,	1
The	1
Oppressors	1
wrong,	1
the	1
poore	1
mans	1
Contumely,	1
The	1
pangs	1
of	1
dispriz'd	1
Loue,	1
the	1
Lawes	1
delay,	1
The	1
insolence	1
of	1
Office,	1
and	1
the	1
Spurnes	1
That	1
patient	1
merit	1
of	1
the	1
vnworthy	1
takes,	1
When	1
he	1
himselfe	1
might	1
his	1
Quietus	1
make	1
With	1
a	1
bare	1
Bodkin?	1
Who	1
would	1
these	1
Fardles	1
beare	1
To	1
grunt	1
and	1
sweat	1
vnder	1
a	1
weary	1
life,	1
But	1
that	1
the	1
dread	1
of	1
something	1
after	1
death,	1
The	1
vndiscouered	1
Countrey,	1
from	1
whose	1
Borne	1
No	1
Traueller	1
returnes,	1
Puzels	1
the	1
will,	1
And	1
makes	1
vs	1
rather	1
beare	1
those	1
illes	1
we	1
haue,	1
Then	1
flye	1
to	1
others	1
that	1
we	1
know	1
not	1
of.	1
Thus	1
Conscience	1
does	1
make	1
Cowards	1
of	1
vs	1
all,	1
And	1
thus	1
the	1
Natiue	1
hew	1
of	1
Resolution	1
Is	1
sicklied	1
o're,	1
with	1
the	1
pale	1
cast	1
of	1
Thought,	1
And	1
enterprizes	1
of	1
great	1
pith	1
and	1
moment,	1
With	1
this	1
regard	1
their	1
Currants	1
turne	1
away,	1
And	1
loose	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Action.	1
Soft	1
you	1
now,	1
The	1
faire	1
Ophelia?	1
Nimph,	1
in	1
thy	1
Orizons	1
Be	1
all	1
my	1
sinnes	1
remembred	1
Ophe.	1
Good	1
my	1
Lord,	1
How	1
does	1
your	1
Honor	1
for	1
this	1
many	1
a	1
day?	1
Ham.	1
I	1
humbly	1
thanke	1
you:	1
well,	1
well,	1
well	1
Ophe.	1
My	1
Lord,	1
I	1
haue	1
Remembrances	1
of	1
yours,	1
That	1
I	1
haue	1
longed	1
long	1
to	1
re-deliuer.	1
I	1
pray	1
you	1
now,	1
receiue	1
them	1
Ham.	1
No,	1
no,	1
I	1
neuer	1
gaue	1
you	1
ought	1
Ophe.	1
My	1
honor'd	1
Lord,	1
I	1
know	1
right	1
well	1
you	1
did,	1
And	1
with	1
them	1
words	1
of	1
so	1
sweet	1
breath	1
compos'd,	1
As	1
made	1
the	1
things	1
more	1
rich,	1
then	1
perfume	1
left:	1
Take	1
these	1
againe,	1
for	1
to	1
the	1
Noble	1
minde	1
Rich	1
gifts	1
wax	1
poore,	1
when	1
giuers	1
proue	1
vnkinde.	1
There	1
my	1
Lord	1
Ham.	1
Ha,	1
ha:	1
Are	1
you	1
honest?	1
Ophe.	1
My	1
Lord	1
Ham.	1
Are	1
you	1
faire?	1
Ophe.	1
What	1
meanes	1
your	1
Lordship?	1
Ham.	1
That	1
if	1
you	1
be	1
honest	1
and	1
faire,	1
your	1
Honesty	1
should	1
admit	1
no	1
discourse	1
to	1
your	1
Beautie	1
Ophe.	1
Could	1
Beautie	1
my	1
Lord,	1
haue	1
better	1
Comerce	1
then	1
your	1
Honestie?	1
Ham.	1
I	1
trulie:	1
for	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
Beautie,	1
will	1
sooner	1
transforme	1
Honestie	1
from	1
what	1
is,	1
to	1
a	1
Bawd,	1
then	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
Honestie	1
can	1
translate	1
Beautie	1
into	1
his	1
likenesse.	1
This	1
was	1
sometime	1
a	1
Paradox,	1
but	1
now	1
the	1
time	1
giues	1
it	1
proofe.	1
I	1
did	1
loue	1
you	1
once	1
Ophe.	1
Indeed	1
my	1
Lord,	1
you	1
made	1
me	1
beleeue	1
so	1
Ham.	1
You	1
should	1
not	1
haue	1
beleeued	1
me.	1
For	1
vertue	1
cannot	1
so	1
innocculate	1
our	1
old	1
stocke,	1
but	1
we	1
shall	1
rellish	1
of	1
it.	1
I	1
loued	1
you	1
not	1
Ophe.	1
I	1
was	1
the	1
more	1
deceiued	1
Ham.	1
Get	1
thee	1
to	1
a	1
Nunnerie.	1
Why	1
would'st	1
thou	1
be	1
a	1
breeder	1
of	1
Sinners?	1
I	1
am	1
my	1
selfe	1
indifferent	1
honest,	1
but	1
yet	1
I	1
could	1
accuse	1
me	1
of	1
such	1
things,	1
that	1
it	1
were	1
better	1
my	1
Mother	1
had	1
not	1
borne	1
me.	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
prowd,	1
reuengefull,	1
Ambitious,	1
with	1
more	1
offences	1
at	1
my	1
becke,	1
then	1
I	1
haue	1
thoughts	1
to	1
put	1
them	1
in	1
imagination,	1
to	1
giue	1
them	1
shape,	1
or	1
time	1
to	1
acte	1
them	1
in.	1
What	1
should	1
such	1
Fellowes	1
as	1
I	1
do,	1
crawling	1
betweene	1
Heauen	1
and	1
Earth.	1
We	1
are	1
arrant	1

Enter	1

King.	1
Loue?	1
His	1

Nor	1

though	1
it	1

Forme	1

Was	1

There's	1

O're	1
which	1
his	1
Melancholly	1

And	1

Thus	1

With	1

Obiects,	1

This	1

Whereon	1

From	1

Pol.	1
It	1

The	1
Origin	1

How	1

My	1

do	1

But	1
if	1

Let	1

To	1

Of	1

To	1

send	1

Or	1
confine	1

where	1
Your	1

It	1

Exeunt.	1

Speake	1

as	1
I	1
pronounc'd	1

Tongue:	1
But	1
if	1

your	1
Players	1
do,	1
I	1
had	1

Torrent,	1
Tempest,	1
and	1
(as	1
I	1
say)	1
the	1
Whirle-winde	1
of	1

you	1
must	1
acquire	1
and	1
beget	1
a	1
Temperance	1
that	1

Smoothnesse.	1
O	1

are	1
capeable	1
of	1
nothing,	1

That	1

for	1
any	1
thing	1
so	1
ouer-done,	1
is	1
fro[m]	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
Playing,	1
whose	1
end	1
both	1
at	1
the	1

was	1

is,	1
to	1

make	1
the	1
Iudicious	1
greeue;	1
The	1
censure	1
of	1
the	1
which	1
One,	1
must	1

neyther	1

men,	1
and	1
not	1

abhominably	1
Play.	1

reform'd	1
that	1
indifferently	1
with	1

Sir	1
Ham.	1
O	1

For	1

to	1
set	1
on	1
some	1
quantitie	1
of	1
barren	1
Spectators	1
to	1

though	1
in	1

necessary	1
Question	1
of	1

Nay,	1

For	1

That	1

Discomfort	1

For	1

And	1
as	1

Faith	1
I	1

And	1

Honour'd,	1
belou'd,	1
and	1
haply,	1

For	1

thou-	1

Oh	1
confound	1
the	1

Such	1
Loue,	1

be	1
Treason	1
in	1
my	1

In	1
second	1

let	1

be	1
accurst,	1
None	1

Are	1

A	1

I	1
kill	1
my	1

dead,	1
When	1
second	1

kisses	1
me	1
in	1
Bed	1
King.	1
I	1
do	1
beleeue	1
you.	1
Think	1
what	1
now	1
you	1
speak:	1
But	1
what	1
we	1
do	1
determine,	1
oft	1
we	1
breake:	1
Purpose	1
is	1
but	1
the	1
slaue	1
to	1
Memorie,	1
Of	1
violent	1
Birth,	1
but	1
poore	1
validitie:	1
Which	1
now	1

But	1
fall	1
vnshaken,	1
when	1
they	1
mellow	1
bee.	1
Most	1
necessary	1
'tis,	1
that	1
we	1
forget	1
To	1
pay	1
our	1
selues,	1
what	1
to	1
our	1
selues	1
is	1
debt:	1
What	1
to	1
our	1
selues	1
in	1
passion	1
we	1
propose,	1
The	1
passion	1
ending,	1
doth	1
the	1
purpose	1
lose.	1
The	1
violence	1
of	1
other	1
Greefe	1
or	1
Ioy,	1
Their	1
owne	1
ennactors	1
with	1
themselues	1

Where	1
Ioy	1
most	1
Reuels,	1
Greefe	1
doth	1
most	1
lament;	1
Greefe	1
ioyes,	1
Ioy	1
greeues	1
on	1
slender	1

This	1
world	1
is	1
not	1
for	1
aye,	1
nor	1
'tis	1
not	1
strange	1
That	1
euen	1
our	1
Loues	1
should	1
with	1
our	1
Fortunes	1
change.	1
For	1
'tis	1
a	1
question	1
left	1
vs	1
yet	1
to	1
proue,	1
Whether	1
Loue	1
lead	1
Fortune,	1
or	1
else	1
Fortune	1
Loue.	1
The	1
great	1
man	1

marke	1
his	1
fauourites	1

The	1
poore	1
aduanc'd,	1
makes	1
Friends	1
of	1
Enemies:	1
And	1
hitherto	1
doth	1
Loue	1
on	1
Fortune	1
tend,	1
For	1
who	1
not	1
needs,	1
shall	1
neuer	1
lacke	1
a	1
Frend:	1
And	1
who	1
in	1
want	1
a	1
hollow	1
Friend	1
doth	1
try,	1
Directly	1
seasons	1
him	1
his	1
Enemie.	1
But	1
orderly	1
to	1
end,	1
where	1
I	1
begun,	1
Our	1
Willes	1
and	1
Fates	1
do	1
so	1
contrary	1
run,	1
That	1
our	1
Deuices	1
still	1
are	1
ouerthrowne,	1
Our	1
thoughts	1
are	1
ours,	1
their	1
ends	1
none	1
of	1
our	1
owne.	1
So	1
thinke	1
thou	1
wilt	1
no	1
second	1
Husband	1
wed.	1
But	1
die	1
thy	1
thoughts,	1
when	1
thy	1
first	1
Lord	1
is	1
dead	1
Bap.	1
Nor	1
Earth	1

Each	1

Meet	1
what	1
I	1
would	1
haue	1
well,	1
and	1
it	1
destroy:	1
Both	1
heere,	1
and	1
hence,	1
pursue	1
me	1
lasting	1
strife,	1
If	1
once	1
a	1
Widdow,	1

Wife	1

If	1

'Tis	1
deepely	1
sworne:	1
Sweet,	1
leaue	1
me	1
heere	1
a	1
while,	1
My	1
spirits	1
grow	1
dull,	1
and	1
faine	1
I	1

The	1

Guild.	1
No	1

shew	1

to	1

Good	1

The	1

great	1

of	1

You	1

Guild.	1
Nay,	1
good	1

If	1

Make	1

But	1
sir,	1
such	1
answers	1
as	1
I	1
can	1
make,	1
you	1
shal	1
command:	1
or	1
rather	1
you	1
say,	1
my	1
Mother:	1

My	1

Then	1
thus	1
she	1
sayes:	1
your	1
behauior	1
hath	1
stroke	1
her	1
into	1
amazement,	1
and	1
admiration	1
Ham.	1
Oh	1
wonderfull	1
Sonne,	1
that	1
can	1
so	1
astonish	1
a	1
Mother.	1
But	1
is	1
there	1
no	1
sequell	1
at	1
the	1

Rosin.	1
She	1

Closset,	1

Haue	1

Rosin.	1
My	1
Lord,	1
you	1
once	1
did	1
loue	1
me	1
Ham.	1
So	1
I	1
do	1
still,	1
by	1
these	1
pickers	1
and	1
stealers	1
Rosin.	1
Good	1
my	1
Lord,	1
what	1
is	1
your	1
cause	1
of	1
distemper?	1
You	1
do	1
freely	1
barre	1
the	1
doore	1
of	1
your	1
owne	1
Libertie,	1
if	1
you	1
deny	1
your	1

Ham.	1
Sir	1
I	1
lacke	1
Aduancement	1

How	1

the	1
voyce	1
of	1
the	1
King	1
himselfe,	1

Ham.	1
I,	1
but	1
while	1
the	1
grasse	1
growes,	1
the	1
Prouerbe	1
is	1
something	1
musty.	1
Enter	1

a	1
Recorder.	1
O	1
the	1
Recorder.	1
Let	1
me	1
see,	1
to	1
withdraw	1
with	1
you,	1
why	1
do	1
you	1
go	1
about	1
to	1
recouer	1
the	1
winde	1
of	1
mee,	1
as	1
if	1
you	1
would	1
driue	1
me	1
into	1
a	1
toyle?	1
Guild.	1
O	1
my	1
Lord,	1
if	1
my	1
Dutie	1
be	1
too	1
bold,	1
my	1
loue	1
is	1
too	1
vnmannerly	1
Ham.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
well	1
vnderstand	1
that.	1
Will	1
you	1
play	1
vpon	1
this	1
Pipe?	1
Guild.	1
My	1

I	1
cannot	1
Ham.	1
I	1
pray	1
you	1
Guild.	1
Beleeue	1
me,	1
I	1
cannot	1
Ham.	1
I	1
do	1
beseech	1
you	1
Guild.	1
I	1
know	1
no	1
touch	1
of	1
it,	1
my	1
Lord	1
Ham.	1
'Tis	1
as	1
easie	1
as	1
lying:	1
gouerne	1
these	1
Ventiges	1
with	1
your	1
finger	1
and	1
thumbe,	1
giue	1
it	1
breath	1
with	1

mouth,	1
and	1

will	1
discourse	1
most	1
excellent	1
Musicke.	1
Looke	1
you,	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
stoppes	1
Guild.	1
But	1
these	1
cannot	1
I	1
command	1
to	1
any	1
vtterance	1
of	1
hermony,	1
I	1
haue	1
not	1

Why	1
looke	1
you	1
now,	1
how	1
vnworthy	1
a	1
thing	1
you	1
make	1
of	1
me:	1
you	1
would	1
play	1
vpon	1
mee;	1
you	1
would	1
seeme	1
to	1
know	1
my	1
stops:	1
you	1
would	1
pluck	1
out	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
my	1
Mysterie;	1
you	1
would	1
sound	1
mee	1
from	1
my	1
lowest	1
Note,	1
to	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
my	1
Compasse:	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
much	1
Musicke,	1
excellent	1
Voice,	1
in	1
this	1
little	1
Organe,	1
yet	1
cannot	1
you	1
make	1
it.	1
Why	1
do	1
you	1
thinke,	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
easier	1
to	1
bee	1
plaid	1
on,	1
then	1
a	1
Pipe?	1
Call	1
me	1
what	1
Instrument	1
you	1
will,	1
though	1
you	1
can	1
fret	1
me,	1
you	1
cannot	1
play	1
vpon	1
me.	1
God	1
blesse	1
you	1
Sir.	1
Enter	1
Polonius.	1
Polon.	1
My	1
Lord;	1
the	1
Queene	1
would	1
speak	1
with	1
you,	1
and	1
presently	1
Ham.	1
Do	1
you	1
see	1
that	1
Clowd?	1
that's	1
almost	1
in	1
shape	1
like	1
a	1
Camell	1
Polon.	1
By'th'	1
Masse,	1
and	1
it's	1
like	1
a	1
Camell	1
indeed	1
Ham.	1
Me	1
thinkes	1
it	1
is	1
like	1
a	1
Weazell	1
Polon.	1
It	1
is	1
back'd	1
like	1
a	1
Weazell	1
Ham.	1
Or	1
like	1
a	1
Whale?	1
Polon.	1
Verie	1
like	1

Whale	1
Ham.	1
Then	1
will	1
I	1
come	1
to	1
my	1
Mother,	1

and	1
by:	1
They	1
foole	1
me	1

I	1

Polon.	1
I	1
will	1
say	1
so.	1
Enter.	1
Ham.	1
By	1

easily	1
said.	1
Leaue	1

Now	1
could	1
I	1
drink	1
hot	1
blood,	1
And	1
do	1
such	1
bitter	1
businesse	1
as	1
the	1

Would	1
quake	1
to	1
looke	1
on.	1
Soft	1
now,	1
to	1
my	1

Oh	1

Therefore	1

Out	1

And	1
as	1
you	1

and	1
wisely	1
was	1
it	1

'Tis	1

Thankes	1
deere	1

Oh	1
my	1

It	1
hath	1
the	1

A	1

murther.	1
Pray	1
can	1
I	1
not,	1
Though	1

sharpe	1

My	1
stronger	1

defeats	1
my	1
strong	1

And	1
like	1

bound,	1
I	1
stand	1
in	1
pause	1
where	1
I	1
shall	1
first	1
begin,	1
And	1
both	1
neglect;	1
what	1
if	1
this	1
cursed	1
hand	1
Were	1
thicker	1
then	1
it	1
selfe	1
with	1
Brothers	1

Is	1
there	1

Raine	1
enough	1
in	1
the	1

Whereto	1
serues	1

And	1
what's	1

Prayer,	1
but	1
this	1
two-fold	1

To	1
be	1
fore-stalled	1
ere	1

Or	1
pardon'd	1
being	1

Then	1
Ile	1
looke	1

My	1

past.	1
But	1
oh,	1
what	1
forme	1
of	1
Prayer	1
Can	1
serue	1
my	1

Forgiue	1
me	1
my	1

Murther:	1
That	1
cannot	1

possest	1
Of	1

for	1
which	1
I	1
did	1
the	1
Murther.	1
My	1

May	1

In	1
the	1

currants	1
of	1
this	1

Offences	1
gilded	1

may	1
shoue	1
by	1
Iustice,	1
And	1
oft	1
'tis	1

the	1

Buyes	1
out	1
the	1
Law;	1
but	1
'tis	1
not	1

There	1
is	1
no	1

In	1

To	1

What	1

What	1

Try	1
what	1
Repentance	1

What	1
can	1

not?	1
Yet	1
what	1
can	1

when	1
one	1
cannot	1

Oh	1
wretched	1

Oh	1

Oh	1

Now	1

An	1

A	1
Station,	1

the	1

Mercurie	1
New	1

A	1

Where	1

To	1

Looke	1

Heere	1

Blasting	1

Haue	1

Could	1

Ha?	1
Haue	1

You	1

Loue:	1
For	1
at	1
your	1

The	1
hey-day	1
in	1
the	1

tame,	1
it's	1
humble,	1
And	1
waites	1

Would	1

In	1

Stew'd	1

A	1

not	1
twentieth	1

Of	1

A	1

That	1

His	1

Ham.	1
That	1

Besides,	1

Rosin.	1
Take	1

such	1
Officers	1

best	1
seruice	1

He	1

My	1

The	1

Of	1

How	1

that	1
this	1
man	1
goes	1
loose:	1
Yet	1
must	1
not	1

multitude,	1
Who	1
like	1
not	1

And	1
where	1
'tis	1
so,	1
th'	1
Offenders	1

weigh'd	1
But	1
neerer	1

to	1

This	1

Deliberate	1

Without	1

Bring	1

At	1

Not	1

Let	1

I	1

part	1

ouerlook'd	1

these	1
Fellowes	1
some	1
meanes	1
to	1
the	1
King:	1
They	1
haue	1
Letters	1
for	1
him.	1
Ere	1
we	1
were	1
two	1
dayes	1
old	1
at	1
Sea,	1
a	1
Pyrate	1
of	1
very	1
Warlicke	1
appointment	1
gaue	1
vs	1
Chace.	1
Finding	1
our	1
selues	1
too	1
slow	1
of	1
Saile,	1
we	1
put	1
on	1
a	1
compelled	1
Valour.	1
In	1
the	1
Grapple,	1
I	1
boorded	1
them:	1
On	1
the	1
instant	1
they	1
got	1
cleare	1
of	1
our	1
Shippe,	1
so	1
I	1
alone	1
became	1
their	1
Prisoner.	1
They	1
haue	1
dealt	1
with	1
mee,	1
like	1
Theeues	1
of	1
Mercy,	1
but	1
they	1
knew	1
what	1
they	1
did.	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
doe	1
a	1
good	1
turne	1
for	1
them.	1
Let	1
the	1
King	1
haue	1
the	1
Letters	1
I	1
haue	1
sent,	1
and	1
repaire	1
thou	1
to	1
me	1
with	1
as	1
much	1
hast	1
as	1
thou	1
wouldest	1
flye	1
death.	1
I	1
haue	1
words	1
to	1
speake	1
in	1
your	1
eare,	1
will	1
make	1
thee	1
dumbe,	1
yet	1
are	1
they	1
much	1
too	1
light	1
for	1
the	1
bore	1
of	1
the	1
Matter.	1
These	1
good	1
Fellowes	1
will	1
bring	1
thee	1
where	1
I	1
am.	1
Rosincrance	1
and	1
Guildensterne,	1
hold	1
their	1
course	1
for	1
England.	1
Of	1
them	1
I	1
haue	1
much	1
to	1
tell	1
thee,	1
Farewell.	1
He	1
that	1
thou	1
knowest	1
thine,	1
Hamlet.	1
Come,	1
I	1
will	1
giue	1
you	1
way	1
for	1
these	1
your	1
Letters,	1
And	1
do't	1
the	1
speedier,	1
that	1
you	1
may	1
direct	1
me	1
To	1
him	1
from	1
whom	1
you	1
brought	1
them.	1
Enter.	1
Enter	1
King	1
and	1
Laertes.	1
King.	1
Now	1
must	1
your	1
conscience	1
my	1
acquittance	1
seal,	1
And	1
you	1
must	1
put	1
me	1
in	1
your	1
heart	1
for	1
Friend,	1
Sith	1
you	1
haue	1
heard,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
knowing	1
eare,	1
That	1
he	1
which	1
hath	1
your	1
Noble	1
Father	1
slaine,	1
Pursued	1
my	1
life	1
Laer.	1
It	1
well	1
appeares.	1
But	1
tell	1
me,	1
Why	1
you	1
proceeded	1
not	1
against	1
these	1
feates,	1
So	1
crimefull,	1
and	1
so	1
Capitall	1
in	1
Nature,	1
As	1
by	1
your	1
Safety,	1
Wisedome,	1
all	1
things	1
else,	1
You	1
mainly	1
were	1
stirr'd	1
vp?	1
King.	1
O	1
for	1
two	1
speciall	1
Reasons,	1
Which	1
may	1
to	1
you	1
(perhaps)	1
seeme	1
much	1
vnsinnowed,	1
And	1
yet	1
to	1
me	1
they	1
are	1
strong.	1
The	1
Queen	1
his	1
Mother,	1
Liues	1
almost	1
by	1
his	1
lookes:	1
and	1
for	1
my	1
selfe,	1
My	1
Vertue	1
or	1
my	1
Plague,	1
be	1
it	1
either	1
which,	1
She's	1
so	1
coniunctiue	1
to	1
my	1
life,	1
and	1
soule;	1
That	1
as	1
the	1
Starre	1
moues	1
not	1
but	1
in	1
his	1
Sphere,	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
by	1
her.	1
The	1
other	1
Motiue,	1
Why	1
to	1
a	1
publike	1
count	1
I	1
might	1
not	1
go,	1
Is	1
the	1
great	1
loue	1
the	1
generall	1
gender	1
beare	1
him,	1
Who	1
dipping	1
all	1
his	1
Faults	1
in	1
their	1
affection,	1
Would	1
like	1
the	1
Spring	1
that	1
turneth	1
Wood	1
to	1
Stone,	1
Conuert	1
his	1
Gyues	1
to	1
Graces.	1
So	1
that	1
my	1
Arrowes	1
Too	1
slightly	1
timbred	1
for	1
so	1
loud	1
a	1
Winde,	1
Would	1
haue	1
reuerted	1
to	1
my	1
Bow	1
againe,	1
And	1
not	1
where	1
I	1
had	1
arm'd	1
them	1
Laer.	1
And	1
so	1
haue	1
I	1
a	1
Noble	1
Father	1
lost,	1
A	1
Sister	1
driuen	1
into	1
desperate	1
tearmes,	1
Who	1
was	1
(if	1
praises	1
may	1
go	1
backe	1
againe)	1
Stood	1
Challenger	1
on	1
mount	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
Age	1
For	1
her	1
perfections.	1
But	1
my	1
reuenge	1
will	1
come	1
King.	1
Breake	1
not	1
your	1
sleepes	1
for	1
that,	1
You	1
must	1
not	1
thinke	1
That	1
we	1
are	1
made	1
of	1
stuffe,	1
so	1
flat,	1
and	1
dull,	1
That	1
we	1
can	1
let	1
our	1
Beard	1
be	1
shooke	1
with	1
danger,	1
And	1
thinke	1
it	1
pastime.	1
You	1
shortly	1
shall	1
heare	1
more,	1
I	1
lou'd	1
your	1
Father,	1
and	1
we	1
loue	1
our	1
Selfe,	1
And	1
that	1
I	1
hope	1
will	1
teach	1
you	1
to	1
imagine-	1
Enter	1

Messenger.	1
How	1

What	1
Newes?	1
Mes.	1
Letters	1
my	1
Lord	1

Hamlet,	1
This	1
to	1
your	1

the	1
Queene	1
King.	1
From	1
Hamlet?	1
Who	1
brought	1
them?	1
Mes.	1
Saylors	1
my	1
Lord	1
they	1
say,	1
I	1
saw	1
them	1
not:	1
They	1
were	1
giuen	1
me	1
by	1
Claudio,	1
he	1
receiu'd	1
them	1
King.	1
Laertes	1
you	1
shall	1
heare	1
them:	1
Leaue	1
vs.	1
Exit	1
Messenger	1
High	1
and	1
Mighty,	1
you	1
shall	1
know	1
I	1
am	1
set	1
naked	1
on	1
your	1
Kingdome.	1
To	1
morrow	1
shall	1
I	1
begge	1
leaue	1
to	1
see	1
your	1
Kingly	1
Eyes.	1
When	1
I	1
shall	1
(first	1
asking	1
your	1
Pardon	1
thereunto)	1
recount	1
th'	1
Occasions	1
of	1
my	1
sodaine,	1
and	1
more	1
strange	1
returne.	1
Hamlet.	1
What	1
should	1
this	1
meane?	1
Are	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
come	1
backe?	1
Or	1
is	1
it	1
some	1
abuse?	1
Or	1
no	1
such	1
thing?	1
Laer.	1
Know	1
you	1
the	1
hand?	1
Kin.	1
'Tis	1
Hamlets	1
Character,	1
naked	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
Postscript	1
here	1
he	1
sayes	1
alone:	1
Can	1
you	1
aduise	1
me?	1
Laer.	1
I'm	1
lost	1
in	1
it	1
my	1
Lord;	1
but	1
let	1
him	1
come,	1
It	1
warmes	1
the	1
very	1
sicknesse	1
in	1
my	1
heart,	1
That	1
I	1
shall	1
liue	1
and	1
tell	1
him	1
to	1
his	1
teeth;	1
Thus	1
diddest	1
thou	1
Kin.	1
If	1
it	1
be	1
so	1
Laertes,	1
as	1
how	1
should	1
it	1
be	1
so:	1
How	1
otherwise	1
will	1
you	1
be	1
rul'd	1
by	1
me?	1
Laer.	1
If	1
so	1
you'l	1
not	1
o'rerule	1
me	1
to	1
a	1
peace	1
Kin.	1
To	1
thine	1
owne	1
peace:	1
if	1
he	1
be	1
now	1
return'd,	1
As	1
checking	1
at	1
his	1
Voyage,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
meanes	1
No	1
more	1
to	1
vndertake	1
it;	1
I	1
will	1
worke	1
him	1
To	1
an	1
exployt	1
now	1
ripe	1
in	1
my	1
Deuice,	1
Vnder	1
the	1
which	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
choose	1
but	1
fall;	1
And	1
for	1
his	1
death	1
no	1
winde	1
of	1
blame	1
shall	1
breath,	1
But	1
euen	1
his	1
Mother	1
shall	1
vncharge	1
the	1
practice,	1
And	1
call	1
it	1
accident:	1
Some	1
two	1
Monthes	1
hence	1
Here	1
was	1
a	1
Gentleman	1
of	1
Normandy,	1
I'ue	1
seene	1
my	1
selfe,	1
and	1
seru'd	1
against	1
the	1
French,	1
And	1
they	1
ran	1
well	1
on	1
Horsebacke;	1
but	1
this	1
Gallant	1
Had	1
witchcraft	1
in't;	1
he	1
grew	1
into	1
his	1
Seat,	1
And	1
to	1
such	1
wondrous	1
doing	1
brought	1
his	1
Horse,	1
As	1
had	1
he	1
beene	1
encorps't	1
and	1
demy-Natur'd	1
With	1
the	1
braue	1
Beast,	1
so	1
farre	1
he	1
past	1
my	1
thought,	1
That	1
I	1
in	1
forgery	1
of	1
shapes	1
and	1
trickes,	1
Come	1
short	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
did	1
Laer.	1
A	1
Norman	1
was't?	1
Kin.	1
A	1
Norman	1
Laer.	1
Vpon	1
my	1
life	1
Lamound	1
Kin.	1
The	1
very	1
same	1
Laer.	1
I	1
know	1
him	1
well,	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
Brooch	1
indeed,	1
And	1
Iemme	1
of	1
all	1
our	1
Nation	1
Kin.	1
Hee	1
mad	1
confession	1
of	1
you,	1
And	1
gaue	1
you	1
such	1
a	1
Masterly	1
report,	1
For	1
Art	1
and	1
exercise	1
in	1
your	1
defence;	1
And	1
for	1
your	1
Rapier	1
most	1
especiall,	1
That	1
he	1
cryed	1
out,	1
t'would	1
be	1
a	1
sight	1
indeed,	1
If	1
one	1
could	1
match	1
you	1
Sir.	1
This	1
report	1
of	1
his	1
Did	1
Hamlet	1
so	1
envenom	1
with	1
his	1
Enuy,	1
That	1
he	1
could	1
nothing	1
doe	1
but	1
wish	1
and	1
begge,	1
Your	1
sodaine	1
comming	1
ore	1
to	1
play	1
with	1
him;	1
Now	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
Laer.	1
Why	1
out	1
of	1
this,	1
my	1
Lord?	1
Kin.	1
Laertes	1
was	1
your	1
Father	1
deare	1
to	1
you?	1
Or	1
are	1
you	1
like	1
the	1
painting	1
of	1
a	1
sorrow,	1
A	1
face	1
without	1
a	1
heart?	1
Laer.	1
Why	1
aske	1
you	1
this?	1
Kin.	1
Not	1
that	1
I	1
thinke	1
you	1
did	1
not	1
loue	1
your	1
Father,	1
But	1
that	1
I	1
know	1
Loue	1
is	1
begun	1
by	1
Time:	1
And	1
that	1
I	1
see	1
in	1
passages	1
of	1
proofe,	1
Time	1
qualifies	1
the	1
sparke	1
and	1
fire	1
of	1
it:	1
Hamlet	1
comes	1
backe:	1
what	1
would	1
you	1
vndertake,	1
To	1
show	1
your	1
selfe	1
your	1
Fathers	1
sonne	1
indeed,	1
More	1
then	1
in	1
words?	1
Laer.	1
To	1
cut	1
his	1
throat	1
i'th'	1
Church	1
Kin.	1
No	1
place	1
indeed	1
should	1
murder	1
Sancturize;	1
Reuenge	1
should	1
haue	1
no	1
bounds:	1
but	1
good	1
Laertes	1
Will	1
you	1
doe	1
this,	1
keepe	1
close	1
within	1
your	1
Chamber,	1
Hamlet	1
return'd,	1
shall	1
know	1
you	1
are	1
come	1
home:	1
Wee'l	1
put	1
on	1
those	1
shall	1
praise	1
your	1
excellence,	1
And	1
set	1
a	1
double	1
varnish	1
on	1
the	1
fame	1
The	1
Frenchman	1
gaue	1
you,	1
bring	1
you	1
in	1
fine	1
together,	1
And	1
wager	1
on	1
your	1
heads,	1
he	1
being	1
remisse,	1
Most	1
generous,	1
and	1
free	1
from	1
all	1
contriuing,	1
Will	1
not	1
peruse	1
the	1
Foiles?	1
So	1
that	1
with	1
ease,	1
Or	1
with	1
a	1
little	1
shuffling,	1
you	1
may	1
choose	1
A	1
Sword	1
vnbaited,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
passe	1
of	1
practice,	1
Requit	1
him	1
for	1
your	1
Father	1
Laer.	1
I	1
will	1
doo't.	1
And	1
for	1
that	1
purpose	1
Ile	1
annoint	1
my	1
Sword:	1
I	1
bought	1
an	1
Vnction	1
of	1
a	1
Mountebanke	1
So	1
mortall,	1
I	1
but	1
dipt	1
a	1
knife	1
in	1
it,	1
Where	1
it	1
drawes	1
blood,	1
no	1
Cataplasme	1
so	1
rare,	1
Collected	1
from	1
all	1
Simples	1
that	1
haue	1
Vertue	1
Vnder	1
the	1
Moone,	1
can	1
saue	1
the	1
thing	1
from	1
death,	1
That	1
is	1
but	1
scratcht	1
withall:	1
Ile	1
touch	1
my	1
point,	1
With	1
this	1
contagion,	1
that	1
if	1
I	1
gall	1
him	1
slightly,	1
It	1
may	1
be	1
death	1
Kin.	1
Let's	1
further	1
thinke	1
of	1
this,	1
Weigh	1
what	1
conuenience	1
both	1
of	1
time	1
and	1
meanes	1
May	1
fit	1
vs	1
to	1
our	1
shape,	1
if	1
this	1
should	1
faile;	1
And	1
that	1
our	1
drift	1
looke	1
through	1
our	1
bad	1
performance,	1
'Twere	1
better	1
not	1
assaid;	1
therefore	1
this	1
Proiect	1
Should	1
haue	1
a	1
backe	1
or	1
second,	1
that	1
might	1
hold,	1
If	1
this	1
should	1
blast	1
in	1
proofe:	1
Soft,	1
let	1
me	1
see	1
Wee'l	1
make	1
a	1
solemne	1
wager	1
on	1
your	1
commings,	1
I	1
ha't:	1
when	1
in	1
your	1
motion	1
you	1
are	1
hot	1
and	1
dry,	1
As	1
make	1
your	1
bowts	1
more	1
violent	1
to	1
the	1
end,	1
And	1
that	1
he	1
cals	1
for	1
drinke;	1
Ile	1
haue	1
prepar'd	1
him	1
A	1
Challice	1
for	1
the	1
nonce;	1
whereon	1
but	1
sipping,	1
If	1
he	1
by	1
chance	1
escape	1
your	1
venom'd	1
stuck,	1
Our	1
purpose	1
may	1
hold	1
there;	1
how	1
sweet	1
Queene.	1
Enter	1
Queene.	1
Queen.	1
One	1
woe	1
doth	1
tread	1
vpon	1
anothers	1
heele,	1
So	1
fast	1
they'l	1

Of	1

That	1

But	1

Fell	1

And	1
Mermaid-like,	1

Which	1
time	1

chaunted	1
snatches	1
of	1
old	1

As	1
one	1
incapable	1
of	1

Or	1

Natiue,	1
and	1

Vnto	1

Alas	1

Too	1

Nature	1

Let	1

when	1
these	1

The	1

Adue	1

I	1
haue	1
a	1
speech	1
of	1

Therefore	1

vnlesse	1

Why	1

Clo.	1
It	1

Se	1
offendendo,	1

heere	1
lies	1
the	1
point;	1
If	1
I	1
drowne	1
my	1
selfe	1
wittingly,	1
it	1
argues	1
an	1
Act:	1
and	1
an	1
Act	1
hath	1
three	1
branches.	1
It	1
is	1
an	1
Act	1
to	1

Nay	1

If	1

it	1
is	1
will	1
he	1
nill	1

But	1
if	1

hee	1
drownes	1
not	1

And	1

Why,	1

Heere	1

Alexander	1

the	1

might	1

Might	1

Oh,	1
that	1
that	1

Should	1

But	1

Worse	1

When	1

There's	1

To	1

Their	1

An	1

Larded	1
with	1
many	1

of	1

Importing	1
Denmarks	1

Englands	1
too,	1
With	1
hoo,	1
such	1
Bugges	1
and	1
Goblins	1

No	1

My	1

Hor.	1
Ist	1
possible?	1
Ham.	1
Here's	1
the	1
Commission,	1
read	1

at	1

But	1
wilt	1

heare	1
me	1
how	1
I	1
did	1
proceed?	1
Hor.	1
I	1
beseech	1
you	1
Ham.	1
Being	1
thus	1
benetted	1
round	1
with	1
Villaines,	1
Ere	1
I	1
could	1
make	1
a	1
Prologue	1
to	1
my	1

They	1
had	1
begun	1
the	1
Play.	1
I	1
sate	1

downe,	1
Deuis'd	1
a	1
new	1
Commission,	1
wrote	1
it	1
faire,	1
I	1
once	1
did	1
hold	1
it	1
as	1
our	1
Statists	1
doe,	1
A	1
basenesse	1
to	1
write	1
faire;	1
and	1
laboured	1
much	1
How	1
to	1
forget	1
that	1
learning:	1

It	1
did	1
me	1
Yeomans	1
seriuce:	1
wilt	1

know	1
The	1
effects	1
of	1
what	1
I	1
wrote?	1
Hor.	1

An	1

As	1

Thy	1

'tis	1

Sweet	1
Lord,	1
if	1

I	1
will	1

Osr.	1

No,	1

It	1

my	1

Mee	1

it	1
is	1
very	1
soultry,	1
and	1
hot	1
for	1
my	1
Complexion	1
Osr.	1
Exceedingly,	1
my	1
Lord,	1
it	1

great	1
wager	1

Sir,	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
matter	1
Ham.	1
I	1
beseech	1
you	1
remember	1
Osr.	1
Nay,	1
in	1
good	1
faith,	1
for	1
mine	1
ease	1
in	1
good	1
faith:	1
Sir,	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
ignorant	1
of	1
what	1
excellence	1
Laertes	1
is	1
at	1
his	1
weapon	1
Ham.	1
What's	1
his	1
weapon?	1
Osr.	1
Rapier	1
and	1
dagger	1
Ham.	1
That's	1
two	1
of	1
his	1
weapons;	1
but	1
well	1
Osr.	1
The	1
sir	1
King	1
ha's	1
wag'd	1
with	1
him	1
six	1
Barbary	1
horses,	1
against	1
the	1
which	1
he	1
impon'd	1
as	1
I	1
take	1
it,	1
sixe	1
French	1
Rapiers	1
and	1
Poniards,	1
with	1
their	1
assignes,	1
as	1
Girdle,	1
Hangers	1
or	1
so:	1
three	1
of	1
the	1
Carriages	1
infaith	1
are	1
very	1
deare	1
to	1
fancy,	1
very	1
responsiue	1
to	1
the	1
hilts,	1
most	1
delicate	1
carriages,	1
and	1
of	1
very	1
liberall	1
conceit	1
Ham.	1
What	1
call	1
you	1
the	1
Carriages?	1
Osr.	1
The	1
Carriages	1
Sir,	1
are	1
the	1
hangers	1
Ham.	1
The	1
phrase	1
would	1
bee	1
more	1
Germaine	1
to	1
the	1
matter:	1
If	1
we	1
could	1
carry	1
Cannon	1
by	1
our	1
sides;	1
I	1
would	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
Hangers	1
till	1
then;	1
but	1
on	1
sixe	1
Barbary	1
Horses	1
against	1
sixe	1
French	1
Swords:	1
their	1
Assignes,	1
and	1
three	1
liberall	1
conceited	1
Carriages,	1
that's	1
the	1
French	1
but	1
against	1
the	1
Danish;	1
why	1
is	1
this	1
impon'd	1
as	1
you	1
call	1
it?	1
Osr.	1
The	1
King	1
Sir,	1
hath	1
laid	1
that	1
in	1
a	1
dozen	1
passes	1
betweene	1
you	1
and	1
him,	1
hee	1
shall	1
not	1
exceed	1
you	1
three	1
hits;	1
He	1
hath	1
one	1
twelue	1
for	1
mine,	1
and	1
that	1
would	1
come	1
to	1
imediate	1
tryall,	1

would	1
vouchsafe	1
the	1
Answere	1
Ham.	1
How	1
if	1
I	1
answere	1
no?	1
Osr.	1
I	1
meane	1
my	1
Lord,	1
the	1
opposition	1
of	1
your	1
person	1
in	1
tryall	1
Ham.	1
Sir,	1
I	1
will	1
walke	1
heere	1
in	1
the	1
Hall;	1
if	1
it	1
please	1
his	1
Maiestie,	1
'tis	1
the	1
breathing	1
time	1
of	1
day	1
with	1
me;	1
let	1
the	1
Foyles	1
bee	1
brought,	1
the	1
Gentleman	1
willing,	1
and	1
the	1
King	1
hold	1
his	1

I	1
will	1
win	1
for	1
him	1
if	1
I	1
can:	1
if	1
not,	1
Ile	1
gaine	1
nothing	1
but	1
my	1
shame,	1
and	1
the	1
odde	1

Osr.	1
Shall	1
I	1
redeliuer	1
you	1
ee'n	1
so?	1
Ham.	1
To	1
this	1
effect	1
Sir,	1
after	1
what	1
flourish	1
your	1
nature	1
will	1
Osr.	1
I	1
commend	1
my	1
duty	1
to	1
your	1
Lordship	1
Ham.	1
Yours,	1
yours;	1
hee	1
does	1
well	1
to	1
commend	1
it	1
himselfe,	1
there	1
are	1
no	1
tongues	1
else	1
for's	1
tongue	1
Hor.	1
This	1
Lapwing	1
runs	1
away	1
with	1
the	1
shell	1
on	1
his	1
head	1
Ham.	1
He	1
did	1
Complie	1
with	1
his	1
Dugge	1
before	1
hee	1
suck't	1
it:	1
thus	1
had	1
he	1
and	1
mine	1
more	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
Beauty	1
that	1
I	1
know	1
the	1
drossie	1
age	1
dotes	1
on;	1
only	1
got	1
the	1
tune	1
of	1
the	1
time,	1
and	1
outward	1
habite	1
of	1
encounter,	1
a	1
kinde	1
of	1
yesty	1
collection,	1
which	1
carries	1
them	1
through	1
&	1
through	1
the	1
most	1
fond	1
and	1
winnowed	1
opinions;	1
and	1
doe	1
but	1
blow	1
them	1
to	1
their	1
tryalls:	1
the	1
Bubbles	1
are	1
out	1
Hor.	1
You	1
will	1
lose	1
this	1
wager,	1
my	1
Lord	1
Ham.	1
I	1
doe	1
not	1
thinke	1
so,	1
since	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
France,	1
I	1
haue	1
beene	1
in	1
continuall	1
practice;	1
I	1
shall	1
winne	1
at	1
the	1
oddes:	1
but	1
thou	1
wouldest	1
not	1
thinke	1
how	1
all	1
heere	1
about	1
my	1
heart:	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
matter	1
Hor.	1
Nay,	1
good	1
my	1
Lord	1
Ham.	1
It	1
is	1
but	1
foolery;	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
such	1
a	1
kinde	1
of	1
gain-giuing	1
as	1
would	1
perhaps	1
trouble	1
a	1
woman	1
Hor.	1
If	1
your	1
minde	1
dislike	1
any	1
thing,	1
obey.	1
I	1
will	1
forestall	1
their	1
repaire	1
hither,	1
and	1
say	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
fit	1
Ham.	1
Not	1
a	1
whit,	1
we	1
defie	1
Augury;	1
there's	1
a	1
speciall	1
Prouidence	1
in	1
the	1
fall	1
of	1
a	1
sparrow.	1
If	1
it	1
be	1
now,	1
'tis	1
not	1
to	1
come:	1
if	1
it	1
bee	1
not	1
to	1

it	1
will	1
bee	1
now:	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
not	1
now;	1
yet	1
it	1
will	1
come;	1
the	1
readinesse	1
is	1
all,	1
since	1
no	1
man	1
ha's	1
ought	1

what	1
he	1

What	1
is't	1
to	1

Enter	1

Queene,	1
Laertes	1
and	1
Lords,	1

Come	1

Giue	1

Sir,	1
I'ue	1

But	1

This	1

And	1
you	1
must	1
needs	1
haue	1
heard	1
how	1
I	1
am	1
punisht	1
With	1

What	1
I	1
haue	1
done	1
That	1
might	1
your	1

Roughly	1
awake,	1
I	1
heere	1
proclaime	1
was	1
madnesse:	1
Was't	1
Hamlet	1
wrong'd	1
Laertes?	1
Neuer	1
Hamlet.	1
If	1
Hamlet	1
from	1
himselfe	1
be	1
tane	1
away:	1
And	1
when	1
he's	1
not	1
himselfe,	1
do's	1
wrong	1
Laertes,	1
Then	1
Hamlet	1
does	1
it	1
not,	1
Hamlet	1
denies	1
it:	1
Who	1
does	1
it	1
then?	1
His	1
Madnesse?	1
If't	1
be	1
so,	1
Hamlet	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
Faction	1
that	1
is	1
wrong'd,	1
His	1
madnesse	1
is	1
poore	1
Hamlets	1
Enemy.	1

I	1
am	1
satisfied	1
