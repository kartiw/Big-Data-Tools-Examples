you,	1
And	1
you	1
precedents,	1
connect	1
lovingly	1
with	1
them,	1
for	1
they	1
connect	1
lovingly	1
with	1
you.	1
I	1
conn'd	1
old	1
times,	1
I	1
sat	1
studying	1
at	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
masters,	1
Now	1
if	1
eligible	1
O	1
that	1
the	1
great	1
masters	1
might	1
return	1
and	1
study	1
me.	1
In	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
these	1
States	1
shall	1
I	1
scorn	1
the	1
antique?	1
Why	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
antique	1
to	1
justify	1
it.	1

Dead	1

Martyrs,	1
artists,	1

Language-shapers	1
on	1
other	1
shores,	1
Nations	1
once	1
powerful,	1
now	1
reduced,	1
withdrawn,	1
or	1

I	1
dare	1
not	1
proceed	1
till	1
I	1
respectfully	1
credit	1
what	1
you	1
have	1
left	1
wafted	1
hither,	1
I	1
have	1
perused	1
it,	1
own	1
it	1
is	1
admirable,	1
(moving	1
awhile	1
among	1
it,)	1
Think	1
nothing	1
can	1
ever	1
be	1
greater,	1
nothing	1
can	1
ever	1
deserve	1
more	1
than	1
it	1
deserves,	1
Regarding	1
it	1
all	1
intently	1
a	1
long	1
while,	1
then	1
dismissing	1
it,	1
I	1
stand	1
in	1
my	1
place	1
with	1
my	1
own	1
day	1
here.	1
Here	1
lands	1
female	1
and	1
male,	1
Here	1
the	1
heir-ship	1
and	1
heiress-ship	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
here	1
the	1
flame	1
of	1
materials,	1
Here	1
spirituality	1
the	1
translatress,	1
the	1
openly-avow'd,	1
The	1
ever-tending,	1
the	1
finale	1
of	1
visible	1
forms,	1
The	1
satisfier,	1
after	1
due	1
long-waiting	1
now	1
advancing,	1
Yes	1
here	1
comes	1
my	1
mistress	1
the	1
soul.	1

The	1
soul,	1
Forever	1
and	1
forever--longer	1
than	1
soil	1
is	1
brown	1
and	1
solid--longer	1
than	1
water	1
ebbs	1
and	1
flows.	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
the	1
poems	1
of	1
materials,	1
for	1
I	1
think	1
they	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
most	1
spiritual	1
poems,	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
the	1
poems	1
of	1
my	1
body	1
and	1
of	1
mortality,	1
For	1
I	1
think	1
I	1
shall	1
then	1
supply	1
myself	1
with	1
the	1
poems	1
of	1
my	1
soul	1
and	1
of	1
immortality.	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
a	1
song	1
for	1
these	1
States	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
State	1
may	1
under	1
any	1
circumstances	1
be	1
subjected	1
to	1
another	1
State,	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
a	1
song	1
that	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
comity	1
by	1
day	1
and	1
by	1
night	1
between	1
all	1
the	1
States,	1
and	1
between	1
any	1
two	1
of	1
them,	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
a	1
song	1
for	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
the	1
President,	1
full	1
of	1
weapons	1
with	1
menacing	1
points,	1
And	1
behind	1
the	1
weapons	1
countless	1
dissatisfied	1
faces;	1
And	1
a	1
song	1
make	1
I	1
of	1
the	1
One	1
form'd	1
out	1
of	1
all,	1
The	1
fang'd	1
and	1
glittering	1
One	1
whose	1
head	1
is	1
over	1
all,	1
Resolute	1
warlike	1
One	1
including	1
and	1
over	1
all,	1
(However	1
high	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
any	1
else	1
that	1
head	1
is	1
over	1
all.)	1
I	1
will	1
acknowledge	1
contemporary	1
lands,	1
I	1
will	1
trail	1
the	1
whole	1
geography	1
of	1
the	1
globe	1
and	1
salute	1
courteously	1
every	1
city	1
large	1
and	1
small,	1
And	1
employments!	1
I	1
will	1
put	1
in	1
my	1
poems	1
that	1
with	1
you	1
is	1
heroism	1
upon	1
land	1
and	1
sea,	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
report	1
all	1
heroism	1
from	1
an	1
American	1
point	1
of	1
view.	1
I	1
will	1
sing	1
the	1
song	1
of	1
companionship,	1
I	1
will	1
show	1
what	1
alone	1
must	1
finally	1
compact	1
these,	1
I	1
believe	1
these	1
are	1
to	1
found	1
their	1
own	1
ideal	1
of	1
manly	1
love,	1
indicating	1
it	1
in	1
me,	1
I	1
will	1
therefore	1
let	1
flame	1
from	1
me	1
the	1
burning	1
fires	1
that	1
were	1
threatening	1
to	1
consume	1
me,	1
I	1
will	1
lift	1
what	1
has	1
too	1
long	1
kept	1
down	1
those	1
smouldering	1
fires,	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
them	1
complete	1
abandonment,	1
I	1
will	1
write	1
the	1
evangel-poem	1
of	1
comrades	1
and	1
of	1
love,	1
For	1
who	1
but	1
I	1
should	1
understand	1
love	1
with	1
all	1
its	1
sorrow	1
and	1
joy?	1
And	1
who	1
but	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
the	1
poet	1
of	1
comrades?	1
7	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
credulous	1
man	1
of	1
qualities,	1
ages,	1
races,	1
I	1
advance	1
from	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
spirit,	1
Here	1
is	1
what	1
sings	1
unrestricted	1
faith.	1
Omnes!	1
omnes!	1
let	1
others	1
ignore	1
what	1
they	1
may,	1
I	1
make	1
the	1
poem	1
of	1
evil	1
also,	1
I	1
commemorate	1
that	1
part	1
also,	1
I	1
am	1
myself	1
just	1
as	1
much	1
evil	1
as	1
good,	1
and	1
my	1
nation	1
is--and	1
I	1
say	1
there	1
is	1
in	1
fact	1
no	1
evil,	1
(Or	1
if	1
there	1
is	1
I	1
say	1
it	1
is	1
just	1
as	1
important	1
to	1
you,	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
or	1
to	1
me,	1
as	1
any	1
thing	1
else.)	1
I	1
too,	1
following	1
many	1
and	1
follow'd	1
by	1
many,	1
inaugurate	1
a	1
religion,	1
I	1
descend	1
into	1
the	1
arena,	1
(It	1
may	1
be	1
I	1
am	1
destin'd	1
to	1
utter	1
the	1
loudest	1
cries	1
there,	1
the	1
winner's	1
pealing	1
shouts,	1
Who	1
knows?	1
they	1
may	1
rise	1
from	1
me	1
yet,	1
and	1
soar	1
above	1
every	1
thing.)	1
Each	1
is	1
not	1
for	1
its	1
own	1
sake,	1
I	1
say	1
the	1
whole	1
earth	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
stars	1
in	1
the	1
sky	1
are	1
for	1
religion's	1
sake.	1
I	1
say	1
no	1
man	1
has	1
ever	1
yet	1
been	1
half	1
devout	1
enough,	1
None	1
has	1
ever	1
yet	1
adored	1
or	1
worship'd	1
half	1
enough,	1
None	1
has	1
begun	1
to	1
think	1
how	1
divine	1
he	1
himself	1
is,	1
and	1
how	1
certain	1
the	1
future	1
is.	1
I	1
say	1
that	1
the	1
real	1
and	1
permanent	1
grandeur	1
of	1
these	1
States	1
must	1
be	1
their	1
religion,	1
Otherwise	1
there	1
is	1
just	1
no	1
real	1
and	1
permanent	1
grandeur;	1
(Nor	1
character	1
nor	1
life	1
worthy	1
the	1
name	1
without	1
religion,	1
Nor	1
land	1
nor	1
man	1
or	1
woman	1
without	1
religion.)	1

What	1
are	1
you	1
doing	1
young	1
man?	1
Are	1
you	1
so	1
earnest,	1
so	1
given	1
up	1
to	1
literature,	1
science,	1
art,	1
amours?	1
These	1
ostensible	1
realities,	1
politics,	1
points?	1
Your	1
ambition	1
or	1
business	1
whatever	1
it	1
may	1
be?	1
It	1
is	1
well--against	1
such	1
I	1
say	1
not	1
a	1
word,	1
I	1
am	1
their	1
poet	1
also,	1
But	1
behold!	1
such	1
swiftly	1
subside,	1
burnt	1
up	1
for	1
religion's	1
sake,	1
For	1
not	1
all	1
matter	1
is	1
fuel	1
to	1
heat,	1
impalpable	1
flame,	1
the	1
essential	1
life	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
Any	1
more	1
than	1
such	1
are	1
to	1
religion.	1

What	1
do	1
you	1
seek	1
so	1
pensive	1
and	1
silent?	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
need	1
camerado?	1
Dear	1
son	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
it	1
is	1
love?	1
Listen	1
dear	1
son--listen	1
America,	1
daughter	1
or	1
son,	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
painful	1
thing	1
to	1
love	1
a	1
man	1
or	1
woman	1
to	1
excess,	1
and	1
yet	1
it	1
satisfies,	1
it	1
is	1
great,	1
But	1
there	1
is	1
something	1
else	1
very	1
great,	1
it	1
makes	1
the	1
whole	1
coincide,	1
It,	1
magnificent,	1
beyond	1
materials,	1
with	1
continuous	1
hands	1
sweeps	1
and	1
provides	1
for	1
all.	1
10	1
Know	1
you,	1
solely	1
to	1
drop	1
in	1
the	1
earth	1
the	1
germs	1
of	1
a	1
greater	1
religion,	1
The	1
following	1
chants	1
each	1
for	1
its	1
kind	1
I	1
sing.	1
My	1
comrade!	1
For	1
you	1
to	1
share	1
with	1
me	1
two	1
greatnesses,	1
and	1
a	1
third	1
one	1
rising	1
inclusive	1
and	1
more	1
resplendent,	1
The	1
greatness	1
of	1
Love	1
and	1
Democracy,	1
and	1
the	1
greatness	1
of	1
Religion.	1
Melange	1
mine	1
own,	1
the	1
unseen	1
and	1
the	1
seen,	1
Mysterious	1
ocean	1
where	1
the	1
streams	1
empty,	1
Prophetic	1
spirit	1
of	1
materials	1
shifting	1
and	1
flickering	1
around	1
me,	1
Living	1
beings,	1
identities	1
now	1
doubtless	1
near	1
us	1
in	1
the	1
air	1
that	1
we	1
know	1
not	1
of,	1
Contact	1
daily	1
and	1
hourly	1
that	1
will	1
not	1
release	1
me,	1
These	1
selecting,	1
these	1
in	1
hints	1
demanded	1
of	1
me.	1
Not	1
he	1
with	1
a	1
daily	1
kiss	1
onward	1
from	1
childhood	1
kissing	1
me,	1
Has	1
winded	1
and	1
twisted	1
around	1
me	1
that	1
which	1
holds	1
me	1
to	1
him,	1
Any	1
more	1
than	1
I	1
am	1
held	1
to	1
the	1
heavens	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
spiritual	1
world,	1
After	1
what	1
they	1
have	1
done	1
to	1
me,	1
suggesting	1
themes.	1
O	1
such	1
themes--equalities!	1
O	1
divine	1
average!	1
Warblings	1
under	1
the	1
sun,	1
usher'd	1
as	1
now,	1
or	1
at	1
noon,	1
or	1
setting,	1
Strains	1
musical	1
flowing	1
through	1
ages,	1
now	1
reaching	1
hither,	1
I	1
take	1
to	1
your	1
reckless	1
and	1
composite	1
chords,	1
add	1
to	1
them,	1
and	1
cheerfully	1
pass	1
them	1
forward.	1
11	1
As	1
I	1
have	1
walk'd	1
in	1
Alabama	1
my	1
morning	1
walk,	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
where	1
the	1
she-bird	1
the	1
mocking-bird	1
sat	1
on	1
her	1
nest	1
in	1
the	1
briers	1
hatching	1
her	1
brood.	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
the	1
he-bird	1
also,	1
I	1
have	1
paus'd	1
to	1
hear	1
him	1
near	1
at	1
hand	1
inflating	1
his	1
throat	1
and	1
joyfully	1
singing.	1
And	1
while	1
I	1
paus'd	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
what	1
he	1
really	1
sang	1
for	1
was	1
not	1
there	1
only,	1
Nor	1
for	1
his	1
mate	1
nor	1
himself	1
only,	1
nor	1
all	1
sent	1
back	1
by	1
the	1
echoes,	1
But	1
subtle,	1
clandestine,	1
away	1
beyond,	1
A	1
charge	1
transmitted	1
and	1
gift	1
occult	1
for	1
those	1
being	1
born.	1
12	1
Democracy!	1
near	1
at	1
hand	1
to	1
you	1
a	1
throat	1
is	1
now	1
inflating	1
itself	1
and	1
joyfully	1
singing.	1
Ma	1
femme!	1
for	1
the	1
brood	1
beyond	1
us	1
and	1
of	1
us,	1
For	1
those	1
who	1
belong	1
here	1
and	1
those	1
to	1
come,	1
I	1
exultant	1
to	1
be	1
ready	1
for	1
them	1
will	1
now	1
shake	1
out	1
carols	1
stronger	1
and	1
haughtier	1
than	1
have	1
ever	1
yet	1
been	1
heard	1
upon	1
earth.	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
the	1
songs	1
of	1
passion	1
to	1
give	1
them	1
their	1
way,	1
And	1
your	1
songs	1
outlaw'd	1
offenders,	1
for	1
I	1
scan	1
you	1
with	1
kindred	1
eyes,	1
and	1
carry	1
you	1
with	1
me	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
any.	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
the	1
true	1
poem	1
of	1
riches,	1
To	1
earn	1
for	1
the	1
body	1
and	1
the	1
mind	1
whatever	1
adheres	1
and	1
goes	1
forward	1
and	1
is	1
not	1
dropt	1
by	1
death;	1
I	1
will	1
effuse	1
egotism	1
and	1
show	1
it	1
underlying	1
all,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
bard	1
of	1
personality,	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
show	1
of	1
male	1
and	1
female	1
that	1
either	1
is	1
but	1
the	1
equal	1
of	1
the	1
other,	1
And	1
sexual	1
organs	1
and	1
acts!	1
do	1
you	1
concentrate	1
in	1
me,	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
determin'd	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
with	1
courageous	1
clear	1
voice	1
to	1
prove	1
you	1
illustrious,	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
show	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
imperfection	1
in	1
the	1
present,	1
and	1
can	1
be	1
none	1
in	1
the	1
future,	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
show	1
that	1
whatever	1
happens	1
to	1
anybody	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
turn'd	1
to	1
beautiful	1
results,	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
show	1
that	1
nothing	1
can	1
happen	1
more	1
beautiful	1
than	1
death,	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
thread	1
a	1
thread	1
through	1
my	1
poems	1
that	1
time	1
and	1
events	1
are	1
compact,	1
And	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
universe	1
are	1
perfect	1
miracles,	1
each	1
as	1
profound	1
as	1
any.	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
make	1
poems	1
with	1
reference	1
to	1
parts,	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
poems,	1
songs,	1
thoughts,	1
with	1
reference	1
to	1
ensemble,	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
sing	1
with	1
reference	1
to	1
a	1
day,	1
but	1
with	1
reference	1
to	1
all	1
days,	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
make	1
a	1
poem	1
nor	1
the	1
least	1
part	1
of	1
a	1
poem	1
but	1
has	1
reference	1
to	1
the	1
soul,	1
Because	1
having	1
look'd	1
at	1
the	1
objects	1
of	1
the	1
universe,	1
I	1
find	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
one	1
nor	1
any	1
particle	1
of	1
one	1
but	1
has	1
reference	1
to	1
the	1
soul.	1
13	1
Was	1
somebody	1
asking	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
soul?	1
See,	1
your	1
own	1
shape	1
and	1
countenance,	1
persons,	1
substances,	1
beasts,	1
the	1
trees,	1
the	1
running	1
rivers,	1
the	1
rocks	1
and	1
sands.	1
All	1
hold	1
spiritual	1

You	1
shall	1
possess	1
the	1
good	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
sun,	1
(there	1
are	1
millions	1
of	1
suns	1
left,)	1
You	1
shall	1
no	1
longer	1
take	1
things	1
at	1
second	1

third	1
hand,	1
nor	1
look	1
through	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
dead,	1
nor	1
feed	1
on	1
the	1
spectres	1
in	1
books,	1
You	1
shall	1
not	1
look	1
through	1
my	1
eyes	1
either,	1
nor	1
take	1
things	1
from	1
me,	1
You	1
shall	1
listen	1
to	1
all	1
sides	1
and	1
filter	1
them	1
from	1
your	1

I	1
have	1
heard	1
what	1
the	1
talkers	1
were	1
talking,	1
the	1
talk	1
of	1
the	1
beginning	1
and	1
the	1
end,	1
But	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
talk	1
of	1
the	1
beginning	1
or	1
the	1
end.	1
There	1
was	1
never	1
any	1
more	1
inception	1
than	1
there	1
is	1
now,	1
Nor	1
any	1
more	1
youth	1
or	1
age	1
than	1
there	1
is	1
now,	1
And	1
will	1
never	1
be	1
any	1
more	1
perfection	1
than	1
there	1
is	1
now,	1
Nor	1
any	1
more	1
heaven	1
or	1
hell	1
than	1
there	1
is	1
now.	1
Urge	1
and	1
urge	1
and	1
urge,	1
Always	1
the	1
procreant	1
urge	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
Out	1
of	1
the	1
dimness	1
opposite	1
equals	1
advance,	1
always	1
substance	1
and	1
increase,	1
always	1
sex,	1
Always	1
a	1
knit	1
of	1
identity,	1
always	1
distinction,	1
always	1
a	1
breed	1
of	1
life.	1
To	1
elaborate	1
is	1
no	1
avail,	1
learn'd	1
and	1
unlearn'd	1
feel	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
so.	1
Sure	1
as	1
the	1
most	1
certain	1
sure,	1
plumb	1
in	1
the	1
uprights,	1
well	1
entretied,	1
braced	1
in	1
the	1
beams,	1
Stout	1
as	1
a	1
horse,	1
affectionate,	1
haughty,	1
electrical,	1
I	1
and	1
this	1
mystery	1
here	1
we	1
stand.	1
Clear	1
and	1
sweet	1
is	1
my	1
soul,	1
and	1
clear	1
and	1
sweet	1
is	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
my	1
soul.	1
Lack	1
one	1
lacks	1
both,	1
and	1
the	1
unseen	1
is	1
proved	1
by	1
the	1
seen,	1
Till	1
that	1
becomes	1
unseen	1
and	1
receives	1
proof	1
in	1
its	1
turn.	1
Showing	1
the	1
best	1
and	1
dividing	1
it	1
from	1
the	1
worst	1
age	1
vexes	1
age,	1
Knowing	1
the	1
perfect	1
fitness	1
and	1
equanimity	1
of	1
things,	1
while	1
they	1
discuss	1
I	1
am	1
silent,	1
and	1
go	1
bathe	1
and	1
admire	1
myself.	1
Welcome	1
is	1
every	1
organ	1
and	1
attribute	1
of	1
me,	1
and	1
of	1
any	1
man	1
hearty	1
and	1
clean,	1
Not	1
an	1
inch	1
nor	1
a	1
particle	1
of	1
an	1
inch	1
is	1
vile,	1
and	1
none	1
shall	1
be	1
less	1
familiar	1
than	1
the	1
rest.	1
I	1
am	1
satisfied--I	1
see,	1
dance,	1
laugh,	1
sing;	1
As	1
the	1
hugging	1
and	1
loving	1
bed-fellow	1
sleeps	1
at	1
my	1
side	1
through	1
the	1
night,	1
and	1
withdraws	1
at	1
the	1
peep	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
with	1
stealthy	1
tread,	1
Leaving	1
me	1
baskets	1
cover'd	1
with	1
white	1
towels	1
swelling	1
the	1
house	1
with	1
their	1
plenty,	1
Shall	1
I	1
postpone	1
my	1
acceptation	1
and	1
realization	1
and	1
scream	1
at	1
my	1
eyes,	1
That	1
they	1
turn	1
from	1
gazing	1
after	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
road,	1
And	1
forthwith	1
cipher	1
and	1
show	1
me	1
to	1
a	1
cent,	1
Exactly	1
the	1
value	1
of	1
one	1
and	1
exactly	1
the	1
value	1
of	1
two,	1
and	1
which	1
is	1
ahead?	1
4	1
Trippers	1
and	1
askers	1
surround	1
me,	1
People	1
I	1
meet,	1
the	1
effect	1
upon	1
me	1
of	1
my	1
early	1
life	1
or	1
the	1
ward	1
and	1
city	1
I	1
live	1
in,	1
or	1
the	1
nation,	1
The	1
latest	1
dates,	1
discoveries,	1
inventions,	1
societies,	1
authors	1
old	1
and	1
new,	1
My	1
dinner,	1
dress,	1
associates,	1
looks,	1
compliments,	1
dues,	1
The	1
real	1
or	1
fancied	1
indifference	1
of	1
some	1
man	1
or	1
woman	1
I	1
love,	1
The	1
sickness	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
my	1
folks	1
or	1
of	1
myself,	1
or	1
ill-doing	1
or	1
loss	1
or	1
lack	1
of	1
money,	1
or	1
depressions	1
or	1
exaltations,	1
Battles,	1
the	1
horrors	1
of	1
fratricidal	1
war,	1
the	1
fever	1
of	1
doubtful	1
news,	1
the	1
fitful	1
events;	1
These	1
come	1
to	1
me	1
days	1
and	1
nights	1
and	1
go	1
from	1
me	1
again,	1
But	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
the	1
Me	1
myself.	1
Apart	1
from	1
the	1
pulling	1
and	1
hauling	1
stands	1
what	1
I	1
am,	1
Stands	1
amused,	1
complacent,	1
compassionating,	1
idle,	1
unitary,	1
Looks	1
down,	1
is	1
erect,	1
or	1
bends	1
an	1
arm	1
on	1
an	1
impalpable	1
certain	1
rest,	1
Looking	1
with	1
side-curved	1
head	1
curious	1
what	1
will	1
come	1
next,	1
Both	1
in	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
game	1
and	1
watching	1
and	1
wondering	1
at	1
it.	1
Backward	1
I	1
see	1
in	1
my	1
own	1
days	1
where	1
I	1
sweated	1
through	1
fog	1
with	1
linguists	1
and	1
contenders,	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
mockings	1
or	1
arguments,	1
I	1
witness	1
and	1
wait.	1
5	1
I	1
believe	1
in	1
you	1
my	1
soul,	1
the	1
other	1
I	1
am	1
must	1
not	1
abase	1
itself	1
to	1
you,	1
And	1
you	1
must	1
not	1
be	1
abased	1
to	1
the	1
other.	1
Loafe	1
with	1
me	1
on	1
the	1
grass,	1
loose	1
the	1
stop	1
from	1
your	1
throat,	1
Not	1
words,	1
not	1
music	1
or	1
rhyme	1
I	1
want,	1
not	1
custom	1
or	1
lecture,	1
not	1
even	1
the	1
best,	1
Only	1
the	1
lull	1
I	1
like,	1
the	1
hum	1
of	1
your	1
valved	1
voice.	1
I	1
mind	1
how	1
once	1
we	1
lay	1
such	1
a	1
transparent	1
summer	1
morning,	1
How	1
you	1
settled	1
your	1
head	1
athwart	1
my	1
hips	1
and	1
gently	1
turn'd	1
over	1
upon	1
me,	1
And	1
parted	1
the	1
shirt	1
from	1
my	1
bosom-bone,	1
and	1
plunged	1
your	1
tongue	1
to	1
my	1
bare-stript	1
heart,	1
And	1
reach'd	1
till	1
you	1
felt	1
my	1
beard,	1
and	1
reach'd	1
till	1
you	1
held	1
my	1
feet.	1
Swiftly	1
arose	1
and	1
spread	1
around	1
me	1
the	1
peace	1
and	1
knowledge	1
that	1
pass	1
all	1
the	1
argument	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
And	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
the	1
promise	1
of	1
my	1
own,	1
And	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
my	1
own,	1
And	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
ever	1
born	1
are	1
also	1
my	1
brothers,	1
and	1
the	1
women	1
my	1
sisters	1
and	1
lovers,	1
And	1
that	1
a	1
kelson	1
of	1
the	1
creation	1
is	1
love,	1
And	1
limitless	1
are	1
leaves	1
stiff	1
or	1
drooping	1
in	1
the	1
fields,	1
And	1
brown	1
ants	1
in	1
the	1
little	1
wells	1
beneath	1
them,	1
And	1
mossy	1
scabs	1
of	1
the	1
worm	1
fence,	1
heap'd	1
stones,	1
elder,	1
mullein	1
and	1
poke-weed.	1

A	1
child	1
said	1
What	1
is	1
the	1
grass?	1
fetching	1
it	1
to	1
me	1
with	1
full	1
hands;	1
How	1
could	1
I	1
answer	1
the	1
child?	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
any	1
more	1
than	1
he.	1
I	1
guess	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
the	1
flag	1
of	1
my	1
disposition,	1
out	1
of	1
hopeful	1
green	1
stuff	1
woven.	1
Or	1
I	1
guess	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
handkerchief	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
A	1
scented	1
gift	1
and	1
remembrancer	1
designedly	1
dropt,	1
Bearing	1
the	1
owner's	1
name	1
someway	1
in	1
the	1
corners,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
see	1
and	1
remark,	1
and	1
say	1
Whose?	1
Or	1
I	1
guess	1
the	1
grass	1
is	1
itself	1
a	1
child,	1
the	1
produced	1
babe	1
of	1
the	1
vegetation.	1
Or	1
I	1
guess	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
uniform	1
hieroglyphic,	1
And	1
it	1
means,	1
Sprouting	1
alike	1
in	1
broad	1
zones	1
and	1
narrow	1
zones,	1
Growing	1
among	1
black	1
folks	1
as	1
among	1
white,	1
Kanuck,	1
Tuckahoe,	1
Congressman,	1
Cuff,	1
I	1
give	1
them	1
the	1
same,	1
I	1
receive	1
them	1
the	1
same.	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
the	1
beautiful	1
uncut	1
hair	1
of	1
graves.	1
Tenderly	1
will	1
I	1
use	1
you	1
curling	1
grass,	1
It	1
may	1
be	1
you	1
transpire	1
from	1
the	1
breasts	1
of	1
young	1
men,	1
It	1
may	1
be	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
known	1
them	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
loved	1
them,	1
It	1
may	1
be	1
you	1
are	1
from	1
old	1
people,	1
or	1
from	1
offspring	1
taken	1
soon	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
mothers'	1
laps,	1
And	1
here	1
you	1
are	1
the	1
mothers'	1
laps.	1
This	1
grass	1
is	1
very	1
dark	1
to	1
be	1
from	1
the	1
white	1
heads	1
of	1
old	1
mothers,	1
Darker	1
than	1
the	1
colorless	1
beards	1
of	1
old	1
men,	1
Dark	1
to	1
come	1
from	1
under	1
the	1
faint	1
red	1
roofs	1
of	1
mouths.	1
O	1
I	1
perceive	1
after	1
all	1
so	1
many	1
uttering	1
tongues,	1
And	1
I	1
perceive	1
they	1
do	1
not	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
roofs	1
of	1
mouths	1
for	1
nothing.	1
I	1
wish	1
I	1
could	1
translate	1
the	1
hints	1
about	1
the	1
dead	1
young	1
men	1
and	1
women,	1
And	1
the	1
hints	1
about	1
old	1
men	1
and	1
mothers,	1
and	1
the	1
offspring	1
taken	1
soon	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
laps.	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
has	1
become	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
and	1
old	1
men?	1
And	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
has	1
become	1
of	1
the	1
women	1
and	1
children?	1
They	1
are	1
alive	1
and	1
well	1
somewhere,	1
The	1
smallest	1
sprout	1
shows	1
there	1
is	1
really	1
no	1
death,	1
And	1
if	1
ever	1
there	1
was	1
it	1
led	1
forward	1
life,	1
and	1
does	1
not	1
wait	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
to	1
arrest	1
it,	1
And	1
ceas'd	1
the	1
moment	1
life	1
appear'd.	1
All	1
goes	1
onward	1
and	1
outward,	1
nothing	1
collapses,	1
And	1
to	1
die	1
is	1
different	1
from	1
what	1
any	1
one	1
supposed,	1
and	1
luckier.	1
7	1
Has	1
any	1
one	1
supposed	1
it	1
lucky	1
to	1
be	1
born?	1
I	1
hasten	1
to	1
inform	1
him	1
or	1
her	1
it	1
is	1
just	1
as	1
lucky	1
to	1
die,	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
it.	1
I	1
pass	1
death	1
with	1
the	1
dying	1
and	1
birth	1
with	1
the	1
new-wash'd	1
babe,	1
and	1
am	1
not	1
contain'd	1
between	1
my	1
hat	1
and	1
boots,	1
And	1
peruse	1
manifold	1
objects,	1
no	1
two	1
alike	1
and	1
every	1
one	1
good,	1
The	1
earth	1
good	1
and	1
the	1
stars	1
good,	1
and	1
their	1
adjuncts	1
all	1
good.	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
an	1
earth	1
nor	1
an	1
adjunct	1
of	1
an	1
earth,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
mate	1
and	1
companion	1
of	1
people,	1
all	1
just	1
as	1
immortal	1
and	1
fathomless	1
as	1
myself,	1
(They	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
immortal,	1
but	1
I	1
know.)	1
Every	1
kind	1
for	1
itself	1
and	1
its	1
own,	1
for	1
me	1
mine	1
male	1
and	1
female,	1
For	1
me	1
those	1
that	1
have	1
been	1
boys	1
and	1
that	1
love	1
women,	1
For	1
me	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
is	1
proud	1
and	1
feels	1
how	1
it	1
stings	1
to	1
be	1
slighted,	1
For	1
me	1
the	1
sweet-heart	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
maid,	1
for	1
me	1
mothers	1
and	1
the	1
mothers	1
of	1
mothers,	1
For	1
me	1
lips	1
that	1
have	1
smiled,	1
eyes	1
that	1
have	1
shed	1
tears,	1
For	1
me	1
children	1
and	1
the	1
begetters	1
of	1
children.	1
Undrape!	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
guilty	1
to	1
me,	1
nor	1
stale	1
nor	1
discarded,	1
I	1
see	1
through	1
the	1
broadcloth	1
and	1
gingham	1
whether	1
or	1
no,	1
And	1
am	1
around,	1
tenacious,	1
acquisitive,	1
tireless,	1
and	1
cannot	1
be	1
shaken	1
away.	1
8	1
The	1
little	1
one	1
sleeps	1
in	1
its	1
cradle,	1
I	1
lift	1
the	1
gauze	1
and	1
look	1
a	1
long	1
time,	1
and	1
silently	1
brush	1
away	1
flies	1
with	1
my	1
hand.	1
The	1
youngster	1
and	1
the	1
red-faced	1
girl	1
turn	1
aside	1
up	1
the	1
bushy	1
hill,	1
I	1
peeringly	1
view	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
top.	1
The	1
suicide	1
sprawls	1
on	1
the	1
bloody	1
floor	1
of	1
the	1
bedroom,	1
I	1
witness	1
the	1
corpse	1
with	1
its	1
dabbled	1
hair,	1
I	1
note	1
where	1
the	1
pistol	1
has	1
fallen.	1
The	1
blab	1
of	1
the	1
pave,	1
tires	1
of	1
carts,	1
sluff	1
of	1
boot-soles,	1
talk	1
of	1
the	1
promenaders,	1
The	1
heavy	1
omnibus,	1
the	1
driver	1
with	1
his	1
interrogating	1
thumb,	1
the	1
clank	1
of	1
the	1
shod	1
horses	1
on	1
the	1
granite	1
floor,	1
The	1
snow-sleighs,	1
clinking,	1
shouted	1
jokes,	1
pelts	1
of	1
snow-balls,	1
The	1
hurrahs	1
for	1
popular	1
favorites,	1
the	1
fury	1
of	1
rous'd	1
mobs,	1
The	1
flap	1
of	1
the	1
curtain'd	1
litter,	1
a	1
sick	1
man	1
inside	1
borne	1
to	1
the	1
hospital,	1
The	1
meeting	1
of	1
enemies,	1
the	1
sudden	1

the	1

The	1

with	1
his	1

quickly	1
working	1
his	1
passage	1
to	1
the	1

of	1
the	1
crowd,	1
The	1
impassive	1
stones	1
that	1
receive	1
and	1
return	1
so	1
many	1
echoes,	1
What	1
groans	1
of	1
over-fed	1

half-starv'd	1
who	1
fall	1
sunstruck	1
or	1
in	1
fits,	1

exclamations	1
of	1
women	1

Arrests	1
of	1

slights,	1
adulterous	1

them	1

The	1
big	1
doors	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
barn	1
stand	1
open	1
and	1
ready,	1
The	1
dried	1
grass	1
of	1
the	1
harvest-time	1
loads	1
the	1
slow-drawn	1
wagon,	1
The	1
clear	1
light	1
plays	1
on	1
the	1
brown	1
gray	1
and	1
green	1
intertinged,	1
The	1
armfuls	1
are	1
pack'd	1
to	1
the	1
sagging	1
mow.	1
I	1
am	1
there,	1
I	1
help,	1
I	1
came	1
stretch'd	1
atop	1
of	1
the	1
load,	1
I	1
felt	1
its	1
soft	1
jolts,	1
one	1
leg	1
reclined	1
on	1
the	1
other,	1
I	1
jump	1
from	1
the	1
cross-beams	1
and	1
seize	1
the	1
clover	1
and	1
timothy,	1
And	1
roll	1
head	1
over	1
heels	1
and	1
tangle	1
my	1
hair	1
full	1
of	1
wisps.	1
10	1
Alone	1
far	1
in	1
the	1
wilds	1
and	1
mountains	1
I	1
hunt,	1
Wandering	1
amazed	1
at	1
my	1
own	1
lightness	1
and	1
glee,	1
In	1
the	1
late	1
afternoon	1
choosing	1
a	1
safe	1
spot	1
to	1
pass	1
the	1
night,	1
Kindling	1
a	1
fire	1
and	1
broiling	1
the	1
fresh-kill'd	1
game,	1
Falling	1
asleep	1
on	1
the	1
gather'd	1
leaves	1
with	1
my	1
dog	1
and	1
gun	1
by	1
my	1
side.	1
The	1
Yankee	1
clipper	1
is	1
under	1
her	1
sky-sails,	1
she	1
cuts	1
the	1
sparkle	1
and	1
scud,	1
My	1
eyes	1
settle	1
the	1
land,	1
I	1
bend	1
at	1
her	1
prow	1
or	1
shout	1
joyously	1
from	1
the	1
deck.	1
The	1
boatmen	1
and	1
clam-diggers	1
arose	1
early	1
and	1
stopt	1
for	1
me,	1
I	1
tuck'd	1
my	1
trowser-ends	1
in	1
my	1
boots	1
and	1
went	1
and	1
had	1
a	1
good	1
time;	1
You	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
with	1
us	1
that	1
day	1
round	1
the	1
chowder-kettle.	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
marriage	1
of	1
the	1
trapper	1
in	1
the	1
open	1
air	1
in	1
the	1
far	1
west,	1
the	1
bride	1
was	1
a	1
red	1
girl,	1
Her	1
father	1
and	1
his	1
friends	1
sat	1
near	1
cross-legged	1
and	1
dumbly	1
smoking,	1
they	1
had	1
moccasins	1
to	1
their	1
feet	1
and	1
large	1
thick	1
blankets	1
hanging	1
from	1
their	1
shoulders,	1
On	1
a	1
bank	1
lounged	1
the	1
trapper,	1
he	1
was	1
drest	1
mostly	1
in	1
skins,	1
his	1
luxuriant	1
beard	1
and	1
curls	1
protected	1
his	1
neck,	1
he	1
held	1
his	1
bride	1
by	1
the	1
hand,	1
She	1
had	1
long	1
eyelashes,	1
her	1
head	1
was	1
bare,	1
her	1
coarse	1
straight	1
locks	1
descended	1
upon	1
her	1
voluptuous	1
limbs	1
and	1
reach'd	1
to	1
her	1
feet.	1
The	1
runaway	1
slave	1
came	1
to	1
my	1
house	1
and	1
stopt	1
outside,	1
I	1
heard	1
his	1
motions	1
crackling	1
the	1
twigs	1
of	1
the	1
woodpile,	1
Through	1
the	1
swung	1
half-door	1
of	1
the	1
kitchen	1
I	1
saw	1
him	1
limpsy	1
and	1
weak,	1
And	1
went	1
where	1
he	1
sat	1
on	1
a	1
log	1
and	1
led	1
him	1
in	1
and	1
assured	1
him,	1
And	1
brought	1
water	1
and	1
fill'd	1
a	1
tub	1
for	1
his	1
sweated	1
body	1
and	1
bruis'd	1
feet,	1
And	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
room	1
that	1
enter'd	1
from	1
my	1
own,	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
some	1
coarse	1
clean	1
clothes,	1
And	1
remember	1
perfectly	1
well	1
his	1
revolving	1
eyes	1
and	1
his	1
awkwardness,	1
And	1
remember	1
putting	1
piasters	1
on	1
the	1
galls	1
of	1
his	1
neck	1
and	1
ankles;	1
He	1
staid	1
with	1
me	1
a	1
week	1
before	1
he	1
was	1
recuperated	1
and	1
pass'd	1
north,	1
I	1
had	1
him	1
sit	1
next	1
me	1
at	1
table,	1
my	1
fire-lock	1
lean'd	1
in	1
the	1
corner.	1
11	1
Twenty-eight	1
young	1
men	1
bathe	1
by	1
the	1
shore,	1
Twenty-eight	1
young	1
men	1
and	1
all	1
so	1
friendly;	1
Twenty-eight	1
years	1
of	1
womanly	1
life	1
and	1
all	1
so	1
lonesome.	1
She	1
owns	1
the	1
fine	1
house	1
by	1
the	1
rise	1
of	1
the	1
bank,	1
She	1
hides	1
handsome	1
and	1
richly	1
drest	1
aft	1
the	1
blinds	1
of	1
the	1
window.	1
Which	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
does	1
she	1
like	1
the	1
best?	1
Ah	1
the	1
homeliest	1
of	1
them	1
is	1
beautiful	1
to	1
her.	1
Where	1
are	1
you	1
off	1
to,	1
lady?	1
for	1
I	1
see	1
you,	1
You	1
splash	1
in	1
the	1
water	1
there,	1
yet	1
stay	1
stock	1
still	1
in	1
your	1
room.	1
Dancing	1
and	1
laughing	1
along	1
the	1
beach	1
came	1
the	1
twenty-ninth	1
bather,	1
The	1
rest	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
her,	1
but	1
she	1
saw	1
them	1
and	1
loved	1
them.	1
The	1
beards	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
glisten'd	1
with	1
wet,	1
it	1
ran	1
from	1
their	1
long	1
hair,	1
Little	1
streams	1
pass'd	1
all	1
over	1
their	1
bodies.	1
An	1
unseen	1
hand	1
also	1
pass'd	1
over	1
their	1
bodies,	1
It	1
descended	1
tremblingly	1
from	1
their	1
temples	1
and	1
ribs.	1
The	1
young	1
men	1
float	1
on	1
their	1
backs,	1
their	1
white	1
bellies	1
bulge	1
to	1
the	1
sun,	1
they	1
do	1
not	1
ask	1
who	1
seizes	1
fast	1
to	1
them,	1
They	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
who	1
puffs	1
and	1
declines	1
with	1
pendant	1
and	1
bending	1
arch,	1
They	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
whom	1
they	1
souse	1
with	1
spray.	1
12	1
The	1
butcher-boy	1
puts	1
off	1
his	1
killing-clothes,	1
or	1
sharpens	1
his	1
knife	1
at	1
the	1
stall	1
in	1
the	1
market,	1
I	1
loiter	1
enjoying	1
his	1
repartee	1
and	1
his	1
shuffle	1
and	1
break-down.	1
Blacksmiths	1
with	1
grimed	1
and	1
hairy	1
chests	1
environ	1
the	1
anvil,	1
Each	1
has	1
his	1
main-sledge,	1
they	1
are	1
all	1
out,	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
heat	1
in	1
the	1
fire.	1
From	1
the	1
cinder-strew'd	1
threshold	1
I	1
follow	1
their	1
movements,	1
The	1
lithe	1
sheer	1
of	1
their	1
waists	1
plays	1
even	1
with	1
their	1
massive	1
arms,	1
Overhand	1
the	1
hammers	1
swing,	1
overhand	1
so	1
slow,	1
overhand	1
so	1
sure,	1
They	1
do	1
not	1
hasten,	1
each	1
man	1
hits	1
in	1
his	1
place.	1
13	1
The	1
negro	1
holds	1
firmly	1
the	1
reins	1
of	1
his	1
four	1
horses,	1
the	1
block	1
swags	1
underneath	1
on	1
its	1
tied-over	1
chain,	1
The	1
negro	1
that	1
drives	1
the	1
long	1
dray	1
of	1
the	1
stone-yard,	1
steady	1
and	1
tall	1
he	1
stands	1
pois'd	1
on	1
one	1
leg	1
on	1
the	1
string-piece,	1
His	1
blue	1
shirt	1
exposes	1
his	1
ample	1
neck	1
and	1
breast	1
and	1
loosens	1
over	1
his	1
hip-band,	1
His	1
glance	1
is	1
calm	1
and	1
commanding,	1
he	1
tosses	1
the	1
slouch	1
of	1
his	1
hat	1
away	1
from	1
his	1
forehead,	1
The	1
sun	1
falls	1
on	1
his	1
crispy	1
hair	1
and	1
mustache,	1
falls	1
on	1
the	1
black	1
of	1
his	1
polish'd	1
and	1
perfect	1
limbs.	1
I	1
behold	1
the	1
picturesque	1
giant	1
and	1
love	1
him,	1
and	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
stop	1
there,	1
I	1
go	1
with	1
the	1
team	1
also.	1
In	1
me	1
the	1
caresser	1
of	1
life	1
wherever	1
moving,	1
backward	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
forward	1
sluing,	1
To	1
niches	1
aside	1
and	1
junior	1
bending,	1
not	1
a	1
person	1
or	1
object	1
missing,	1
Absorbing	1
all	1
to	1
myself	1
and	1
for	1
this	1
song.	1
Oxen	1
that	1
rattle	1
the	1
yoke	1
and	1
chain	1
or	1
halt	1
in	1
the	1
leafy	1
shade,	1
what	1
is	1
that	1
you	1
express	1
in	1
your	1
eyes?	1
It	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
more	1
than	1
all	1
the	1
print	1
I	1
have	1
read	1
in	1
my	1
life.	1
My	1
tread	1
scares	1
the	1
wood-drake	1
and	1
wood-duck	1
on	1
my	1
distant	1
and	1
day-long	1
ramble,	1
They	1
rise	1
together,	1
they	1
slowly	1
circle	1
around.	1
I	1
believe	1
in	1
those	1
wing'd	1
purposes,	1
And	1
acknowledge	1
red,	1
yellow,	1
white,	1
playing	1
within	1
me,	1
And	1
consider	1
green	1
and	1
violet	1
and	1
the	1
tufted	1
crown	1
intentional,	1
And	1
do	1
not	1
call	1
the	1
tortoise	1
unworthy	1
because	1
she	1
is	1
not	1
something	1
else,	1
And	1
the	1
in	1
the	1
woods	1
never	1
studied	1
the	1
gamut,	1
yet	1
trills	1
pretty	1
well	1
to	1
me,	1
And	1
the	1
look	1
of	1
the	1
bay	1
mare	1
shames	1
silliness	1
out	1
of	1
me.	1
14	1
The	1
wild	1
gander	1
leads	1
his	1
flock	1
through	1
the	1
cool	1
night,	1
Ya-honk	1
he	1
says,	1
and	1
sounds	1
it	1
down	1
to	1
me	1
like	1
an	1
invitation,	1
The	1
pert	1
may	1
suppose	1
it	1
meaningless,	1
but	1
I	1
listening	1
close,	1
Find	1
its	1
purpose	1
and	1
place	1
up	1
there	1
toward	1
the	1
wintry	1
sky.	1
The	1
sharp-hoof'd	1
moose	1
of	1
the	1
north,	1
the	1
cat	1
on	1
the	1
house-sill,	1
the	1
chickadee,	1
the	1
prairie-dog,	1
The	1
litter	1
of	1
the	1
grunting	1
sow	1
as	1
they	1
tug	1
at	1
her	1
teats,	1
The	1
brood	1
of	1
the	1
turkey-hen	1
and	1
she	1
with	1
her	1
half-spread	1
wings,	1
I	1
see	1
in	1
them	1
and	1
myself	1
the	1
same	1
old	1
law.	1
The	1
press	1
of	1
my	1
foot	1
to	1
the	1
earth	1
springs	1
a	1
hundred	1
affections,	1
They	1
scorn	1
the	1
best	1
I	1
can	1
do	1
to	1
relate	1
them.	1
I	1
am	1
enamour'd	1
of	1
growing	1
out-doors,	1
Of	1
men	1
that	1
live	1
among	1
cattle	1
or	1
taste	1
of	1
the	1
ocean	1
or	1
woods,	1
Of	1
the	1
builders	1
and	1
steerers	1
of	1
ships	1
and	1
the	1
wielders	1
of	1
axes	1
and	1
mauls,	1
and	1
the	1
drivers	1
of	1
horses,	1
I	1
can	1
eat	1
and	1
sleep	1
with	1
them	1
week	1
in	1
and	1
week	1
out.	1
What	1
is	1
commonest,	1
cheapest,	1
nearest,	1
easiest,	1
is	1
Me,	1
Me	1
going	1
in	1
for	1
my	1
chances,	1
spending	1
for	1
vast	1
returns,	1
Adorning	1
myself	1
to	1
bestow	1
myself	1
on	1
the	1
first	1
that	1
will	1
take	1
me,	1
Not	1
asking	1
the	1
sky	1
to	1
come	1
down	1
to	1
my	1
good	1
will,	1
Scattering	1
it	1
freely	1
forever.	1

I	1
play	1
not	1

I	1
play	1
marches	1
for	1
conquer'd	1

Have	1
you	1
heard	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
good	1
to	1

the	1

I	1
also	1
say	1
it	1
is	1
good	1
to	1
fall,	1
battles	1
are	1
lost	1
in	1
the	1

beat	1

the	1

equally	1
set,	1

The	1

the	1

is	1
invited;	1
There	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
difference	1
between	1
them	1
and	1
the	1
rest.	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
press	1
of	1
a	1
bashful	1
hand,	1
this	1
the	1
float	1
and	1
odor	1
of	1
hair,	1
This	1
the	1
touch	1
of	1
my	1
lips	1
to	1
yours,	1
this	1
the	1
murmur	1
of	1
yearning,	1
This	1
the	1
far-off	1
depth	1
and	1
height	1
reflecting	1
my	1
own	1
face,	1
This	1
the	1
thoughtful	1
merge	1
of	1
myself,	1
and	1
the	1
outlet	1
again.	1
Do	1
you	1
guess	1
I	1
have	1
some	1
intricate	1
purpose?	1
Well	1
I	1
have,	1
for	1
the	1
Fourth-month	1
showers	1
have,	1
and	1
the	1
mica	1
on	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
a	1

has.	1
Do	1
you	1
take	1
it	1
I	1
would	1
astonish?	1
Does	1
the	1
daylight	1
astonish?	1
does	1
the	1
early	1
redstart	1
twittering	1
through	1
the	1
woods?	1
Do	1
I	1
astonish	1
more	1
than	1
they?	1
This	1
hour	1
I	1
tell	1
things	1
in	1
confidence,	1
I	1
might	1
not	1
tell	1
everybody,	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
you.	1
20	1
Who	1
goes	1
there?	1
hankering,	1
gross,	1
mystical,	1
nude;	1
How	1
is	1
it	1
I	1
extract	1
strength	1
from	1
the	1
beef	1
I	1
eat?	1
What	1
is	1
a	1
man	1
anyhow?	1
what	1
am	1
I?	1
what	1
are	1
you?	1
All	1
I	1
mark	1
as	1
my	1
own	1
you	1
shall	1
offset	1
it	1
with	1
your	1
own,	1
Else	1
it	1
were	1
time	1
lost	1
listening	1
to	1
me.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
snivel	1
that	1
snivel	1
the	1
world	1
over,	1
That	1
months	1
are	1
vacuums	1
and	1
the	1
ground	1
but	1
wallow	1
and	1
filth.	1
Whimpering	1
and	1
truckling	1
fold	1
with	1
powders	1
for	1
invalids,	1
conformity	1
goes	1
to	1
the	1
fourth-remov'd,	1
I	1
wear	1
my	1
hat	1
as	1
I	1
please	1
indoors	1
or	1
out.	1
Why	1
should	1
I	1
pray?	1
why	1
should	1
I	1
venerate	1
and	1
be	1
ceremonious?	1
Having	1
pried	1
through	1
the	1
strata,	1
analyzed	1
to	1
a	1
hair,	1
counsel'd	1
with	1
doctors	1
and	1
calculated	1
close,	1
I	1
find	1
no	1
sweeter	1
fat	1
than	1
sticks	1
to	1
my	1
own	1
bones.	1
In	1
all	1
people	1
I	1
see	1
myself,	1
none	1
more	1
and	1
not	1
one	1
a	1
barley-corn	1
less,	1
And	1
the	1
good	1
or	1
bad	1
I	1
say	1
of	1
myself	1
I	1
say	1
of	1
them.	1
I	1
know	1
I	1
am	1
solid	1
and	1
sound,	1
To	1
me	1
the	1
converging	1
objects	1
of	1
the	1
universe	1
perpetually	1
flow,	1
All	1
are	1
written	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
must	1
get	1
what	1
the	1
writing	1
means.	1
I	1
know	1
I	1
am	1
deathless,	1
I	1
know	1
this	1
orbit	1
of	1
mine	1
cannot	1
be	1
swept	1
by	1
a	1
carpenter's	1
compass,	1
I	1
know	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
pass	1
like	1
a	1
child's	1
carlacue	1
cut	1
with	1
a	1
burnt	1
stick	1
at	1
night.	1
I	1
know	1
I	1
am	1
august,	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
trouble	1
my	1
spirit	1
to	1
vindicate	1
itself	1
or	1
be	1
understood,	1
I	1
see	1
that	1
the	1
elementary	1
laws	1
never	1
apologize,	1
(I	1
reckon	1
I	1
behave	1
no	1
prouder	1
than	1
the	1
level	1
I	1
plant	1
my	1
house	1
by,	1
after	1
all.)	1
I	1
exist	1
as	1
I	1
am,	1
that	1
is	1
enough,	1
If	1
no	1
other	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
be	1
aware	1
I	1
sit	1
content,	1
And	1
if	1
each	1
and	1
all	1
be	1
aware	1
I	1
sit	1
content.	1
One	1
world	1
is	1
aware	1
and	1
by	1
far	1
the	1
largest	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
that	1
is	1
myself,	1
And	1
whether	1
I	1
come	1
to	1
my	1
own	1
to-day	1
or	1
in	1
ten	1
thousand	1
or	1
ten	1
million	1
years,	1
I	1
can	1
cheerfully	1
take	1
it	1
now,	1
or	1
with	1
equal	1
cheerfulness	1
I	1
can	1
wait.	1
My	1
foothold	1
is	1
tenon'd	1
and	1
mortis'd	1
in	1
granite,	1
I	1
laugh	1
at	1
what	1
you	1
call	1
dissolution,	1
And	1
I	1
know	1
the	1
amplitude	1
of	1
time.	1
21	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
poet	1
of	1
the	1
Body	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
poet	1
of	1
the	1
Soul,	1
The	1
pleasures	1
of	1
heaven	1
are	1
with	1
me	1
and	1
the	1
pains	1
of	1
hell	1
are	1
with	1
me,	1
The	1
first	1
I	1
graft	1
and	1
increase	1
upon	1
myself,	1
the	1
latter	1
I	1
translate	1
into	1
new	1
tongue.	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
poet	1
of	1
the	1
woman	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
the	1
man,	1
And	1
I	1
say	1
it	1
is	1
as	1
great	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
woman	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
man,	1
And	1
I	1
say	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
greater	1
than	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
men.	1
I	1
chant	1
the	1
chant	1
of	1
dilation	1
or	1
pride,	1
We	1
have	1
had	1
ducking	1
and	1
deprecating	1
about	1
enough,	1
I	1
show	1
that	1
size	1
is	1
only	1
development.	1
Have	1
you	1
outstript	1
the	1
rest?	1
are	1
you	1
the	1
President?	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
trifle,	1
they	1
will	1
more	1
than	1
arrive	1
there	1
every	1
one,	1
and	1
still	1
pass	1
on.	1
I	1
am	1
he	1
that	1
walks	1
with	1
the	1
tender	1
and	1
growing	1
night,	1
I	1
call	1
to	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
sea	1
half-held	1
by	1
the	1
night.	1
Press	1
close	1
bare-bosom'd	1
night--press	1
close	1
magnetic	1
nourishing	1
night!	1
Night	1
of	1
south	1
winds--night	1
of	1
the	1
large	1
few	1
stars!	1
Still	1
nodding	1
night--mad	1
naked	1
summer	1
night.	1
Smile	1
O	1
voluptuous	1
cool-breath'd	1
earth!	1
Earth	1
of	1
the	1
slumbering	1
and	1
liquid	1
trees!	1
Earth	1
of	1
departed	1
sunset--earth	1
of	1
the	1

misty-topt!	1
Earth	1
of	1
the	1
vitreous	1
pour	1
of	1
the	1
full	1

just	1
tinged	1
with	1
blue!	1
Earth	1
of	1

dark	1
mottling	1

the	1

Earth	1
of	1
the	1
limpid	1
gray	1
of	1
clouds	1
brighter	1
and	1
clearer	1
for	1
my	1
sake!	1
Far-swooping	1
elbow'd	1

apple-blossom'd	1
earth!	1
Smile,	1
for	1
your	1
lover	1
comes.	1
Prodigal,	1
you	1
have	1
given	1
me	1
love--therefore	1
I	1
to	1
you	1
give	1
love!	1
O	1
unspeakable	1
passionate	1
love.	1
22	1
You	1
sea!	1
I	1
resign	1
myself	1
to	1
you	1
also--I	1
guess	1
what	1
you	1
mean,	1
I	1
behold	1
from	1
the	1
beach	1
your	1
crooked	1
fingers,	1
I	1
believe	1
you	1
refuse	1
to	1
go	1
back	1
without	1
feeling	1
of	1
me,	1
We	1
must	1
have	1
a	1
turn	1
together,	1
I	1
undress,	1
hurry	1
me	1
out	1
of	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
Cushion	1
me	1
soft,	1
rock	1
me	1
in	1
billowy	1
drowse,	1
Dash	1
me	1
with	1
amorous	1
wet,	1
I	1
can	1
repay	1
you.	1
Sea	1
of	1
stretch'd	1
ground-swells,	1
Sea	1
breathing	1
broad	1
and	1
convulsive	1
breaths,	1
Sea	1
of	1
the	1
brine	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
of	1
unshovell'd	1
yet	1
always-ready	1
graves,	1
Howler	1
and	1
scooper	1
of	1
storms,	1
capricious	1
and	1
dainty	1
sea,	1
I	1
am	1
integral	1
with	1
you,	1
I	1
too	1
am	1
of	1
one	1
phase	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
phases.	1
Partaker	1
of	1
influx	1
and	1
efflux	1
I,	1
extoller	1
of	1
hate	1
and	1
conciliation,	1
Extoller	1
of	1
amies	1
and	1
those	1
that	1
sleep	1
in	1
each	1
others'	1
arms.	1
I	1
am	1
he	1
attesting	1
sympathy,	1
(Shall	1
I	1
make	1
my	1
list	1
of	1
things	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
skip	1
the	1
house	1
that	1
supports	1
them?)	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
the	1
poet	1
of	1
goodness	1
only,	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
decline	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
poet	1
of	1
wickedness	1
also.	1
What	1
blurt	1
is	1
this	1
about	1
virtue	1
and	1
about	1
vice?	1
Evil	1
propels	1
me	1
and	1
reform	1
of	1
evil	1
propels	1
me,	1
I	1
stand	1
indifferent,	1
My	1
gait	1
is	1
no	1
fault-finder's	1
or	1
rejecter's	1
gait,	1
I	1
moisten	1
the	1
roots	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
has	1
grown.	1
Did	1
you	1
fear	1
some	1
scrofula	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
unflagging	1
pregnancy?	1
Did	1
you	1
guess	1
the	1
celestial	1
laws	1
are	1
yet	1
to	1
be	1
work'd	1
over	1
and	1
rectified?	1
I	1
find	1
one	1
side	1
a	1
balance	1
and	1
the	1
antipedal	1
side	1
a	1
balance,	1
Soft	1
doctrine	1
as	1
steady	1
help	1
as	1
stable	1
doctrine,	1
Thoughts	1
and	1
deeds	1
of	1
the	1
present	1
our	1
rouse	1
and	1
early	1
start.	1
This	1
minute	1
that	1
comes	1
to	1
me	1
over	1
the	1
past	1
decillions,	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
better	1
than	1
it	1
and	1
now.	1
What	1
behaved	1
well	1
in	1
the	1
past	1
or	1
behaves	1
well	1
to-day	1
is	1
not	1
such	1
wonder,	1
The	1
wonder	1
is	1
always	1
and	1
always	1
how	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
a	1
mean	1
man	1
or	1
an	1
infidel.	1
23	1
Endless	1
unfolding	1
of	1
words	1
of	1
ages!	1
And	1
mine	1
a	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
modern,	1
the	1
word	1
En-Masse.	1
A	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
faith	1
that	1
never	1
balks,	1
Here	1
or	1
henceforward	1
it	1
is	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
to	1
me,	1
I	1
accept	1
Time	1
absolutely.	1
It	1
alone	1
is	1
without	1
flaw,	1
it	1
alone	1
rounds	1
and	1
completes	1
all,	1
That	1
mystic	1
baffling	1
wonder	1
alone	1
completes	1
all.	1
I	1
accept	1
Reality	1
and	1
dare	1
not	1
question	1
it,	1
Materialism	1
first	1
and	1
last	1
imbuing.	1
Hurrah	1

Gentlemen,	1

Your	1

are	1
useful,	1
and	1
yet	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
my	1
dwelling,	1
I	1
but	1
enter	1
by	1
them	1
to	1
an	1
area	1
of	1
my	1
dwelling.	1
Less	1
the	1
reminders	1
of	1

told	1
my	1

And	1
more	1
the	1
reminders	1
they	1
of	1
life	1
untold,	1
and	1
of	1
freedom	1
and	1
extrication,	1
And	1
make	1
short	1
account	1
of	1
neuters	1
and	1

and	1
favor	1
men	1

fully	1

And	1
beat	1

Through	1

many	1
long	1

voices,	1
Voices	1
of	1
the	1
interminable	1
generations	1
of	1
prisoners	1

Voices	1
of	1
the	1

and	1
of	1
thieves	1

Voices	1
of	1

accretion,	1
And	1
of	1
the	1
threads	1
that	1
connect	1

And	1

Of	1

foolish,	1
despised,	1
Fog	1

Through	1
me	1
forbidden	1

Voices	1

voices	1
veil'd	1
and	1
I	1
remove	1
the	1
veil,	1
Voices	1
indecent	1
by	1
me	1
clarified	1

transfigur'd.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
press	1
my	1

across	1
my	1
mouth,	1
I	1
keep	1
as	1
delicate	1
around	1
the	1
bowels	1
as	1
around	1
the	1
head	1
and	1
heart,	1
Copulation	1
is	1
no	1
more	1
rank	1
to	1
me	1
than	1
death	1
is.	1
I	1
believe	1
in	1
the	1
flesh	1
and	1
the	1
appetites,	1
Seeing,	1
hearing,	1
feeling,	1
are	1
miracles,	1

each	1

Translucent	1

Winds	1
whose	1
soft-tickling	1

me	1
it	1

Broad	1

branches	1
of	1
live	1
oak,	1
loving	1
lounger	1
in	1
my	1
winding	1
paths,	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
you!	1
Hands	1
I	1
have	1
taken,	1
face	1
I	1
have	1
kiss'd,	1
mortal	1
I	1
have	1
ever	1
touch'd,	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
you.	1
I	1
dote	1
on	1
myself,	1
there	1
is	1
that	1
lot	1
of	1
me	1
and	1
all	1
so	1
luscious,	1
Each	1
moment	1
and	1
whatever	1
happens	1
thrills	1
me	1
with	1
joy,	1
I	1
cannot	1
tell	1
how	1
my	1
ankles	1
bend,	1
nor	1
whence	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
my	1
faintest	1
wish,	1
Nor	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
friendship	1
I	1
emit,	1
nor	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
friendship	1
I	1
take	1
again.	1
That	1
I	1
walk	1
up	1
my	1
stoop,	1
I	1
pause	1
to	1
consider	1
if	1
it	1
really	1
be,	1
A	1
morning-glory	1
at	1
my	1
window	1
satisfies	1
me	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
metaphysics	1
of	1
books.	1
To	1
behold	1
the	1
day-break!	1
The	1
little	1
light	1
fades	1
the	1
immense	1
and	1
diaphanous	1
shadows,	1
The	1
air	1
tastes	1
good	1
to	1
my	1
palate.	1

the	1
moving	1
world	1
at	1
innocent	1
gambols	1
silently	1
rising	1
freshly	1
exuding,	1
Scooting	1
obliquely	1
high	1
and	1
low.	1
Something	1
I	1
cannot	1
see	1
puts	1
upward	1
libidinous	1
prongs,	1
Seas	1
of	1
bright	1
juice	1
suffuse	1
heaven.	1
The	1
earth	1
by	1
the	1
sky	1
staid	1
with,	1
the	1
daily	1
close	1
of	1
their	1
junction,	1
The	1
heav'd	1
challenge	1
from	1
the	1
east	1
that	1
moment	1
over	1
my	1
head,	1
The	1
mocking	1
taunt,	1
See	1
then	1
whether	1
you	1
shall	1
be	1
master!	1
25	1
Dazzling	1
and	1
tremendous	1
how	1
quick	1
the	1
sun-rise	1
would	1
kill	1
me,	1
If	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
now	1
and	1
always	1
send	1
sun-rise	1
out	1
of	1
me.	1
We	1
also	1
ascend	1
dazzling	1
and	1
tremendous	1
as	1
the	1
sun,	1
We	1
found	1
our	1
own	1
O	1
my	1
soul	1
in	1
the	1
calm	1
and	1
cool	1
of	1
the	1
daybreak.	1
My	1
voice	1
goes	1
after	1
what	1
my	1
eyes	1
cannot	1
reach,	1
With	1
the	1
twirl	1
of	1
my	1
tongue	1
I	1
encompass	1
worlds	1
and	1
volumes	1
of	1
worlds.	1
Speech	1
is	1
the	1
twin	1
of	1
my	1
vision,	1
it	1
is	1
unequal	1
to	1
measure	1
itself,	1
It	1
provokes	1
me	1
forever,	1
it	1
says	1
sarcastically,	1
Walt	1
you	1
contain	1
enough,	1
why	1
don't	1
you	1
let	1
it	1
out	1
then?	1
Come	1
now	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
tantalized,	1
you	1
conceive	1
too	1
much	1
of	1
articulation,	1
Do	1
you	1
not	1
know	1
O	1
speech	1
how	1
the	1
buds	1
beneath	1
you	1
are	1
folded?	1
Waiting	1
in	1
gloom,	1
protected	1
by	1
frost,	1
The	1
dirt	1
receding	1
before	1
my	1
prophetical	1
screams,	1
I	1
underlying	1
causes	1
to	1
balance	1
them	1
at	1
last,	1
My	1
knowledge	1
my	1
live	1
parts,	1
it	1
keeping	1
tally	1
with	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
all	1
things,	1
Happiness,	1
(which	1
whoever	1
hears	1
me	1
let	1
him	1
or	1
her	1
set	1
out	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
this	1
day.)	1
My	1
final	1
merit	1
I	1
refuse	1
you,	1
I	1
refuse	1
putting	1
from	1
me	1
what	1
I	1
really	1
am,	1
Encompass	1
worlds,	1
but	1
never	1
try	1
to	1
encompass	1
me,	1
I	1
crowd	1
your	1
sleekest	1
and	1
best	1
by	1
simply	1
looking	1
toward	1
you.	1
Writing	1
and	1
talk	1
do	1
not	1
prove	1
me,	1
I	1
carry	1
the	1
plenum	1
of	1
proof	1
and	1
every	1
thing	1
else	1
in	1
my	1
face,	1
With	1
the	1
hush	1
of	1
my	1
lips	1
I	1
wholly	1
confound	1
the	1
skeptic.	1
26	1
Now	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
nothing	1
but	1
listen,	1
To	1
accrue	1
what	1
I	1
hear	1
into	1
this	1
song,	1
to	1
let	1
sounds	1
contribute	1
toward	1
it.	1
I	1
hear	1
bravuras	1
of	1
birds,	1
bustle	1
of	1
growing	1
wheat,	1
gossip	1
of	1
flames,	1
clack	1
of	1
sticks	1
cooking	1
my	1
meals,	1
I	1
hear	1
the	1
sound	1
I	1
love,	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
human	1
voice,	1
I	1
hear	1
all	1
sounds	1
running	1
together,	1
combined,	1
fused	1
or	1
following,	1
Sounds	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
and	1
sounds	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
sounds	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
and	1
night,	1
Talkative	1
young	1
ones	1
to	1
those	1
that	1
like	1
them,	1
the	1
loud	1
laugh	1
of	1
work-people	1
at	1
their	1
meals,	1
The	1
angry	1
base	1
of	1
disjointed	1
friendship,	1
the	1
faint	1
tones	1
of	1
the	1
sick,	1
The	1
judge	1
with	1
hands	1
tight	1
to	1
the	1
desk,	1
his	1
pallid	1
lips	1
pronouncing	1
a	1
death-sentence,	1
The	1
heave'e'yo	1
of	1
stevedores	1
unlading	1
ships	1
by	1
the	1
wharves,	1
the	1
refrain	1
of	1
the	1
anchor-lifters,	1
The	1
ring	1
of	1
alarm-bells,	1
the	1
cry	1
of	1
fire,	1
the	1
whirr	1
of	1
swift-streaking	1
engines	1
and	1
hose-carts	1
with	1
premonitory	1
tinkles	1
and	1
color'd	1
lights,	1
The	1
steam-whistle,	1
the	1
solid	1
roll	1
of	1
the	1
train	1
of	1
approaching	1
cars,	1
The	1
slow	1
march	1
play'd	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
association	1
marching	1
two	1
and	1
two,	1
(They	1
go	1
to	1
guard	1
some	1
corpse,	1
the	1
flag-tops	1
are	1
draped	1
with	1
black	1
muslin.)	1
I	1
hear	1
the	1
violoncello,	1
('tis	1
the	1
young	1
man's	1
heart's	1
complaint,)	1
I	1
hear	1
the	1
key'd	1
cornet,	1
it	1
glides	1
quickly	1
in	1
through	1
my	1
ears,	1
It	1
shakes	1
mad-sweet	1
pangs	1
through	1
my	1
belly	1
and	1
breast.	1
I	1
hear	1
the	1
chorus,	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
grand	1
opera,	1
Ah	1
this	1
indeed	1
is	1
music--this	1
suits	1
me.	1
A	1
tenor	1
large	1
and	1
fresh	1
as	1
the	1
creation	1
fills	1
me,	1
The	1
orbic	1
flex	1
of	1
his	1
mouth	1
is	1
pouring	1
and	1
filling	1
me	1
full.	1
I	1
hear	1
the	1
train'd	1
soprano	1
(what	1
work	1
with	1
hers	1
is	1
this?)	1
The	1
orchestra	1
whirls	1
me	1
wider	1
than	1
Uranus	1
flies,	1
It	1
wrenches	1
such	1
ardors	1
from	1
me	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
I	1
possess'd	1
them,	1
It	1
sails	1
me,	1
I	1
dab	1
with	1
bare	1
feet,	1
they	1
are	1
lick'd	1
by	1
the	1
indolent	1
waves,	1
I	1
am	1
cut	1
by	1
bitter	1
and	1
angry	1
hail,	1
I	1
lose	1
my	1
breath,	1
Steep'd	1
amid	1
honey'd	1
morphine,	1
my	1
windpipe	1
throttled	1
in	1
fakes	1
of	1
death,	1
At	1
length	1
let	1
up	1
again	1
to	1
feel	1
the	1
puzzle	1
of	1
puzzles,	1
And	1
that	1
we	1
call	1
Being.	1
27	1
To	1
be	1
in	1
any	1
form,	1
what	1
is	1
that?	1
(Round	1
and	1
round	1
we	1
go,	1
all	1
of	1
us,	1
and	1
ever	1
come	1
back	1
thither,)	1
If	1
nothing	1
lay	1
more	1
develop'd	1
the	1
quahaug	1
in	1
its	1
callous	1
shell	1
were	1
enough.	1
Mine	1
is	1
no	1
callous	1
shell,	1
I	1
have	1
instant	1
conductors	1
all	1
over	1
me	1
whether	1
I	1
pass	1
or	1
stop,	1
They	1
seize	1
every	1
object	1
and	1
lead	1
it	1
harmlessly	1
through	1
me.	1
I	1
merely	1
stir,	1
press,	1
feel	1
with	1
my	1
fingers,	1
and	1
am	1
happy,	1
To	1
touch	1
my	1
person	1
to	1
some	1
one	1
else's	1
is	1
about	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
I	1
can	1
stand.	1
28	1
Is	1
this	1
then	1
a	1
touch?	1
quivering	1
me	1
to	1
a	1
new	1
identity,	1
Flames	1
and	1
ether	1
making	1
a	1
rush	1
for	1
my	1
veins,	1
Treacherous	1
tip	1
of	1
me	1
reaching	1
and	1
crowding	1
to	1
help	1
them,	1
My	1
flesh	1
and	1
blood	1
playing	1
out	1
lightning	1
to	1
strike	1
what	1
is	1
hardly	1
different	1
from	1
myself,	1
On	1
all	1
sides	1
prurient	1
provokers	1
stiffening	1
my	1
limbs,	1
Straining	1
the	1
udder	1
of	1
my	1
heart	1
for	1
its	1
withheld	1
drip,	1
Behaving	1
licentious	1
toward	1
me,	1
taking	1
no	1
denial,	1
Depriving	1
me	1
of	1
my	1
best	1
as	1
for	1
a	1
purpose,	1
Unbuttoning	1
my	1
clothes,	1
holding	1
me	1
by	1
the	1
bare	1
waist,	1
Deluding	1
my	1
confusion	1
with	1
the	1
calm	1
of	1
the	1
sunlight	1
and	1
pasture-fields,	1
Immodestly	1
sliding	1
the	1
fellow-senses	1
away,	1
They	1
bribed	1
to	1
swap	1
off	1
with	1
touch	1
and	1
go	1
and	1
graze	1
at	1
the	1
edges	1
of	1
me,	1
No	1
consideration,	1
no	1
regard	1
for	1
my	1
draining	1
strength	1
or	1
my	1
anger,	1
Fetching	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
herd	1
around	1
to	1
enjoy	1
them	1
a	1
while,	1
Then	1
all	1
uniting	1
to	1
stand	1
on	1
a	1
headland	1
and	1
worry	1
me.	1
The	1
sentries	1
desert	1
every	1
other	1
part	1
of	1
me,	1
They	1
have	1
left	1
me	1
helpless	1
to	1
a	1
red	1
marauder,	1
They	1
all	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
headland	1
to	1
witness	1
and	1
assist	1
against	1
me.	1
I	1
am	1
given	1
up	1
by	1
traitors,	1
I	1
talk	1
wildly,	1
I	1
have	1
lost	1
my	1
wits,	1
I	1
and	1
nobody	1
else	1
am	1
the	1
greatest	1
traitor,	1
I	1
went	1
myself	1
first	1
to	1
the	1
headland,	1
my	1
own	1
hands	1
carried	1
me	1
there.	1
You	1
villain	1
touch!	1
what	1
are	1
you	1
doing?	1
my	1
breath	1
is	1
tight	1
in	1
its	1
throat,	1
Unclench	1
your	1
floodgates,	1
you	1
are	1
too	1
much	1
for	1
me.	1
29	1
Blind	1
loving	1
wrestling	1
touch,	1
sheath'd	1
hooded	1
sharp-tooth'd	1
touch!	1
Did	1
it	1
make	1
you	1
ache	1
so,	1
leaving	1
me?	1
Parting	1
track'd	1
by	1
arriving,	1
perpetual	1
payment	1
of	1
perpetual	1
loan,	1
Rich	1
showering	1
rain,	1
and	1
recompense	1
richer	1
afterward.	1
Sprouts	1
take	1
and	1
accumulate,	1
stand	1
by	1
the	1
curb	1
prolific	1
and	1
vital,	1
Landscapes	1
projected	1
masculine,	1
full-sized	1
and	1
golden.	1
30	1
All	1
truths	1
wait	1
in	1
all	1
things,	1
They	1
neither	1
hasten	1
their	1
own	1
delivery	1
nor	1
resist	1
it,	1
They	1
do	1
not	1
need	1
the	1
obstetric	1
forceps	1
of	1
the	1
surgeon,	1
The	1
insignificant	1
is	1
as	1
big	1
to	1
me	1
as	1
any,	1
(What	1
is	1
less	1
or	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
touch?)	1
Logic	1
and	1
sermons	1
never	1
convince,	1
The	1
damp	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
drives	1
deeper	1
into	1
my	1
soul.	1
(Only	1
what	1
proves	1
itself	1
to	1
every	1
man	1
and	1
woman	1
is	1
so,	1
Only	1
what	1
nobody	1
denies	1
is	1
so.)	1
A	1
minute	1
and	1
a	1
drop	1
of	1
me	1
settle	1
my	1
brain,	1
I	1
believe	1
the	1
soggy	1
clods	1
shall	1
become	1
lovers	1
and	1
lamps,	1
And	1
a	1
compend	1
of	1
compends	1
is	1
the	1
meat	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
or	1
woman,	1
And	1
a	1
summit	1
and	1
flower	1
there	1
is	1
the	1
feeling	1
they	1
have	1
for	1
each	1
other,	1
And	1
they	1
are	1
to	1
branch	1
boundlessly	1
out	1
of	1
that	1
lesson	1
until	1
it	1
becomes	1
omnific,	1
And	1
until	1
one	1
and	1
all	1
shall	1
delight	1
us,	1
and	1
we	1
them.	1
31	1
I	1
believe	1
a	1
leaf	1
of	1
grass	1
is	1
no	1
less	1
than	1
the	1
journey	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
stars,	1
And	1
the	1
pismire	1
is	1
equally	1
perfect,	1
and	1
a	1
grain	1
of	1
sand,	1
and	1
the	1
egg	1
of	1
the	1
wren,	1
And	1
the	1
tree-toad	1
is	1
a	1
chef-d'oeuvre	1
for	1
the	1
highest,	1
And	1
the	1
running	1
blackberry	1
would	1
adorn	1
the	1
parlors	1
of	1
heaven,	1
And	1
the	1
narrowest	1
hinge	1
in	1
my	1
hand	1
puts	1
to	1
scorn	1
all	1
machinery,	1
And	1
the	1
cow	1
crunching	1
with	1
depress'd	1
head	1
surpasses	1
any	1
statue,	1
And	1
a	1
mouse	1
is	1
miracle	1
enough	1
to	1
stagger	1
sextillions	1
of	1
infidels.	1
I	1
find	1
I	1
incorporate	1
gneiss,	1
coal,	1
long-threaded	1
moss,	1
fruits,	1
grains,	1
esculent	1
roots,	1
And	1
am	1
stucco'd	1
with	1
quadrupeds	1
and	1
birds	1
all	1
over,	1
And	1
have	1
distanced	1
what	1
is	1
behind	1
me	1
for	1
good	1
reasons,	1
But	1
call	1
any	1
thing	1
back	1
again	1
when	1
I	1
desire	1
it.	1
In	1
vain	1
the	1
speeding	1
or	1
shyness,	1
In	1
vain	1
the	1
plutonic	1
rocks	1
send	1
their	1
old	1
heat	1
against	1
my	1
approach,	1
In	1
vain	1
the	1
mastodon	1
retreats	1
beneath	1
its	1
own	1
powder'd	1
bones,	1
In	1
vain	1
objects	1
stand	1
leagues	1
off	1
and	1
assume	1
manifold	1
shapes,	1
In	1
vain	1
the	1
ocean	1
settling	1
in	1
hollows	1
and	1
the	1
great	1
monsters	1
lying	1
low,	1
In	1
vain	1
the	1
buzzard	1
houses	1
herself	1
with	1
the	1
sky,	1
In	1
vain	1
the	1
snake	1
slides	1
through	1
the	1
creepers	1
and	1
logs,	1
In	1
vain	1
the	1
elk	1
takes	1
to	1
the	1
inner	1
passes	1
of	1
the	1
woods,	1
In	1
vain	1
the	1
razor-bill'd	1
auk	1
sails	1
far	1
north	1
to	1
Labrador,	1
I	1
follow	1
quickly,	1
I	1
ascend	1
to	1
the	1
nest	1
in	1
the	1
fissure	1
of	1
the	1
cliff.	1
32	1
I	1
think	1
I	1
could	1
turn	1
and	1
live	1
with	1
animals,	1
they	1
are	1
so	1
placid	1
and	1
self-contain'd,	1
I	1
stand	1
and	1
look	1
at	1
them	1
long	1
and	1
long.	1
They	1
do	1
not	1
sweat	1
and	1
whine	1
about	1
their	1
condition,	1
They	1
do	1
not	1
lie	1
awake	1
in	1
the	1
dark	1
and	1
weep	1
for	1
their	1
sins,	1
They	1
do	1
not	1
make	1
me	1
sick	1
discussing	1
their	1
duty	1
to	1
God,	1
Not	1
one	1
is	1
dissatisfied,	1
not	1
one	1
is	1
demented	1
with	1
the	1
mania	1
of	1
owning	1
things,	1
Not	1
one	1
kneels	1
to	1
another,	1
nor	1
to	1
his	1
kind	1
that	1
lived	1
thousands	1
of	1
years	1
ago,	1
Not	1
one	1
is	1
respectable	1
or	1
unhappy	1
over	1
the	1
whole	1
earth.	1
So	1
they	1
show	1
their	1
relations	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
I	1
accept	1
them,	1
They	1
bring	1
me	1
tokens	1
of	1
myself,	1
they	1
evince	1
them	1
plainly	1
in	1
their	1
possession.	1
I	1
wonder	1
where	1
they	1
get	1
those	1
tokens,	1
Did	1
I	1
pass	1
that	1
way	1
huge	1
times	1
ago	1
and	1
negligently	1
drop	1
them?	1
Myself	1
moving	1
forward	1
then	1
and	1
now	1
and	1
forever,	1
Gathering	1
and	1
showing	1
more	1
always	1
and	1
with	1
velocity,	1
Infinite	1
and	1
omnigenous,	1
and	1
the	1
like	1
of	1
these	1
among	1
them,	1
Not	1
too	1
exclusive	1
toward	1
the	1
reachers	1
of	1
my	1
remembrancers,	1
Picking	1
out	1
here	1
one	1
that	1
I	1
love,	1
and	1
now	1
go	1
with	1
him	1
on	1
brotherly	1
terms.	1
A	1
gigantic	1
beauty	1
of	1
a	1
stallion,	1
fresh	1
and	1
responsive	1
to	1
my	1
caresses,	1
Head	1
high	1
in	1
the	1
forehead,	1
wide	1
between	1
the	1
ears,	1
Limbs	1
glossy	1
and	1
supple,	1
tail	1
dusting	1
the	1
ground,	1
Eyes	1
full	1
of	1
sparkling	1
wickedness,	1
ears	1
finely	1
cut,	1
flexibly	1
moving.	1
His	1
nostrils	1
dilate	1
as	1
my	1
heels	1
embrace	1
him,	1
His	1
well-built	1
limbs	1
tremble	1
with	1
pleasure	1
as	1
we	1
race	1
around	1
and	1
return.	1
I	1
but	1
use	1
you	1
a	1
minute,	1
then	1
I	1
resign	1
you,	1
stallion,	1
Why	1
do	1
I	1
need	1
your	1
paces	1
when	1
I	1
myself	1
out-gallop	1
them?	1
Even	1
as	1
I	1
stand	1
or	1
sit	1
passing	1
faster	1
than	1
you.	1
33	1
Space	1
and	1
Time!	1
now	1
I	1
see	1
it	1
is	1
true,	1
what	1
I	1
guess'd	1
at,	1
What	1
I	1
guess'd	1
when	1
I	1
loaf'd	1
on	1
the	1
grass,	1
What	1
I	1
guess'd	1
while	1
I	1
lay	1
alone	1
in	1
my	1
bed,	1
And	1
again	1
as	1
I	1
walk'd	1
the	1
beach	1
under	1
the	1
paling	1
stars	1
of	1
the	1
morning.	1
My	1
ties	1
and	1
ballasts	1
leave	1
me,	1
my	1
elbows	1
rest	1
in	1
sea-gaps,	1
I	1
skirt	1
sierras,	1
my	1
palms	1
cover	1
continents,	1
I	1
am	1
afoot	1
with	1
my	1
vision.	1
By	1
the	1
city's	1
quadrangular	1
houses--in	1
log	1
huts,	1
camping	1
with	1
lumber-men,	1
Along	1
the	1
ruts	1
of	1
the	1
turnpike,	1
along	1
the	1
dry	1
gulch	1
and	1
rivulet	1
bed,	1
Weeding	1
my	1
onion-patch	1
or	1
hosing	1
rows	1
of	1
carrots	1
and	1
parsnips,	1
crossing	1
savannas,	1
trailing	1
in	1
forests,	1
Prospecting,	1
gold-digging,	1
girdling	1
the	1
trees	1
of	1
a	1
new	1
purchase,	1
Scorch'd	1
ankle-deep	1
by	1
the	1
hot	1
sand,	1
hauling	1
my	1
boat	1
down	1
the	1
shallow	1
river,	1
Where	1
the	1
panther	1
walks	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
on	1
a	1
limb	1
overhead,	1
where	1
the	1
buck	1
turns	1
furiously	1
at	1
the	1
hunter,	1
Where	1
the	1
rattlesnake	1
suns	1
his	1
flabby	1
length	1
on	1
a	1
rock,	1
where	1
the	1
otter	1
is	1
feeding	1
on	1
fish,	1
Where	1
the	1
alligator	1
in	1
his	1
tough	1
pimples	1
sleeps	1
by	1
the	1
bayou,	1
Where	1
the	1
black	1
bear	1
is	1
searching	1
for	1
roots	1
or	1
honey,	1
where	1
the	1
beaver	1
pats	1
the	1
mud	1
with	1
his	1
paddle-shaped	1
tall;	1
Over	1
the	1
growing	1
sugar,	1
over	1
the	1
yellow-flower'd	1
cotton	1
plant,	1
over	1
the	1
rice	1
in	1
its	1
low	1
moist	1
field,	1
Over	1
the	1
sharp-peak'd	1
farm	1
house,	1
with	1
its	1
scallop'd	1
scum	1
and	1
slender	1
shoots	1
from	1
the	1
gutters,	1
Over	1
the	1
western	1
persimmon,	1
over	1
the	1
long-leav'd	1
corn,	1
over	1
the	1
delicate	1
blue-flower	1
flax,	1
Over	1
the	1
white	1
and	1
brown	1
buckwheat,	1
a	1
hummer	1
and	1
buzzer	1
there	1
with	1
the	1
rest,	1
Over	1
the	1
dusky	1
green	1
of	1
the	1
rye	1
as	1
it	1
ripples	1
and	1
shades	1
in	1
the	1
breeze;	1
Scaling	1
mountains,	1
pulling	1
myself	1
cautiously	1
up,	1
holding	1
on	1
by	1
low	1
scragged	1
limbs,	1
Walking	1
the	1
path	1
worn	1
in	1
the	1
grass	1
and	1
beat	1
through	1
the	1
leaves	1
of	1
the	1
brush,	1
Where	1
the	1
quail	1
is	1
whistling	1
betwixt	1
the	1
woods	1
and	1
the	1
wheat-lot,	1
Where	1
the	1
bat	1
flies	1
in	1
the	1
Seventh-month	1
eve,	1
where	1
the	1
great	1
goldbug	1
drops	1
through	1
the	1
dark,	1
Where	1
the	1
brook	1
puts	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
roots	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
tree	1
and	1
flows	1
to	1
the	1
meadow,	1
Where	1
cattle	1
stand	1
and	1
shake	1
away	1
flies	1
with	1
the	1
tremulous	1
shuddering	1
of	1
their	1
hides,	1
Where	1
the	1
cheese-cloth	1
hangs	1
in	1
the	1
kitchen,	1
where	1
andirons	1
straddle	1
the	1
hearth-slab,	1
where	1
cobwebs	1
fall	1
in	1
festoons	1
from	1
the	1
rafters;	1
Where	1
trip-hammers	1
crash,	1
where	1
the	1
press	1
is	1
whirling	1
its	1
cylinders,	1
Wherever	1
the	1
human	1
heart	1
beats	1
with	1
terrible	1
throes	1
under	1
its	1
ribs,	1
Where	1
the	1
pear-shaped	1
balloon	1
is	1
floating	1
aloft,	1
(floating	1
in	1
it	1
myself	1
and	1
looking	1
composedly	1
down,)	1
Where	1
the	1
life-car	1
is	1
drawn	1
on	1
the	1
slip-noose,	1
where	1
the	1
heat	1
hatches	1
pale-green	1
eggs	1
in	1
the	1
dented	1
sand,	1
Where	1
the	1
she-whale	1
swims	1
with	1
her	1
calf	1
and	1
never	1
forsakes	1
it,	1
Where	1
the	1
steam-ship	1
trails	1
hind-ways	1
its	1
long	1
pennant	1
of	1
smoke,	1
Where	1
the	1
fin	1
of	1
the	1
shark	1
cuts	1
like	1
a	1
black	1
chip	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
water,	1
Where	1
the	1
half-burn'd	1
brig	1
is	1
riding	1
on	1
unknown	1
currents,	1
Where	1
shells	1
grow	1
to	1
her	1
slimy	1
deck,	1
where	1
the	1
dead	1
are	1
corrupting	1
below;	1
Where	1
the	1
dense-starr'd	1
flag	1
is	1
borne	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
regiments,	1
Approaching	1
Manhattan	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
long-stretching	1
island,	1
Under	1
Niagara,	1
the	1
cataract	1
falling	1
like	1
a	1
veil	1
over	1
my	1
countenance,	1
Upon	1
a	1
door-step,	1
upon	1
the	1
horse-block	1
of	1
hard	1
wood	1
outside,	1
Upon	1
the	1
race-course,	1
or	1
enjoying	1
picnics	1
or	1
jigs	1
or	1
a	1
good	1
game	1
of	1
base-ball,	1
At	1
he-festivals,	1
with	1
blackguard	1
gibes,	1
ironical	1
license,	1
bull-dances,	1
drinking,	1
laughter,	1
At	1
the	1
cider-mill	1
tasting	1
the	1
sweets	1
of	1
the	1
brown	1
mash,	1
sucking	1
the	1
juice	1
through	1
a	1
straw,	1
At	1
apple-peelings	1
wanting	1
kisses	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
red	1
fruit	1
I	1
find,	1
At	1
musters,	1
beach-parties,	1
friendly	1
bees,	1
huskings,	1
house-raisings;	1
Where	1
the	1
mocking-bird	1
sounds	1
his	1
delicious	1
gurgles,	1
cackles,	1
screams,	1
weeps,	1
Where	1
the	1
hay-rick	1
stands	1
in	1
the	1
barn-yard,	1
where	1
the	1
dry-stalks	1
are	1
scatter'd,	1
where	1
the	1
brood-cow	1
waits	1
in	1
the	1
hovel,	1
Where	1
the	1
bull	1
advances	1
to	1
do	1
his	1
masculine	1
work,	1
where	1
the	1
stud	1
to	1
the	1
mare,	1
where	1
the	1
cock	1
is	1
treading	1
the	1
hen,	1
Where	1
the	1
heifers	1
browse,	1
where	1
geese	1
nip	1
their	1
food	1
with	1
short	1
jerks,	1
Where	1
sun-down	1
shadows	1
lengthen	1
over	1
the	1
limitless	1
and	1
lonesome	1
prairie,	1
Where	1
herds	1
of	1
buffalo	1
make	1
a	1
crawling	1
spread	1
of	1
the	1
square	1
miles	1
far	1
and	1
near,	1
Where	1
the	1
humming-bird	1
shimmers,	1
where	1
the	1
neck	1
of	1
the	1
long-lived	1
swan	1
is	1
curving	1
and	1
winding,	1
Where	1
the	1
laughing-gull	1
scoots	1
by	1
the	1
shore,	1
where	1
she	1
laughs	1
her	1
near-human	1
laugh,	1
Where	1
bee-hives	1
range	1
on	1
a	1
gray	1
bench	1
in	1
the	1
garden	1
half	1
hid	1
by	1
the	1
high	1
weeds,	1
Where	1
band-neck'd	1
partridges	1
roost	1
in	1
a	1
ring	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
with	1
their	1
heads	1
out,	1
Where	1
burial	1
coaches	1
enter	1
the	1
arch'd	1
gates	1
of	1
a	1
cemetery,	1
Where	1
winter	1
wolves	1
bark	1
amid	1
wastes	1
of	1
snow	1
and	1
icicled	1
trees,	1
Where	1
the	1
yellow-crown'd	1
heron	1
comes	1
to	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
marsh	1
at	1
night	1
and	1
feeds	1
upon	1
small	1
crabs,	1
Where	1
the	1
splash	1
of	1
swimmers	1
and	1
divers	1
cools	1
the	1
warm	1
noon,	1
Where	1
the	1
katy-did	1
works	1
her	1
chromatic	1
reed	1
on	1
the	1
walnut-tree	1
over	1
the	1
well,	1
Through	1
patches	1
of	1
citrons	1
and	1
cucumbers	1
with	1
silver-wired	1
leaves,	1
Through	1
the	1
salt-lick	1
or	1
orange	1
glade,	1
or	1
under	1
conical	1
firs,	1
Through	1
the	1
gymnasium,	1
through	1
the	1
curtain'd	1
saloon,	1
through	1
the	1
office	1
or	1
public	1
hall;	1
Pleas'd	1
with	1
the	1
native	1
and	1
pleas'd	1
with	1
the	1
foreign,	1
pleas'd	1
with	1
the	1
new	1
and	1
old,	1
Pleas'd	1
with	1
the	1
homely	1
woman	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
handsome,	1
Pleas'd	1
with	1
the	1
quakeress	1
as	1
she	1
puts	1
off	1
her	1
bonnet	1
and	1
talks	1
melodiously,	1
Pleas'd	1
with	1
the	1
tune	1
of	1
the	1
choir	1
of	1
the	1
whitewash'd	1
church,	1
Pleas'd	1
with	1
the	1
earnest	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
sweating	1
Methodist	1
preacher,	1
impress'd	1
seriously	1
at	1
the	1
camp-meeting;	1
Looking	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
shop-windows	1
of	1
Broadway	1
the	1
whole	1
forenoon,	1
flatting	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
my	1
nose	1
on	1
the	1
thick	1
plate	1
glass,	1
Wandering	1
the	1
same	1
afternoon	1
with	1
my	1
face	1
turn'd	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
clouds,	1
or	1
down	1
a	1
lane	1
or	1
along	1
the	1
beach,	1
My	1
right	1
and	1
left	1
arms	1
round	1
the	1
sides	1
of	1
two	1
friends,	1
and	1
I	1
in	1
the	1
middle;	1
Coming	1
home	1
with	1
the	1
silent	1
and	1
dark-cheek'd	1
bush-boy,	1
(behind	1
me	1
he	1
rides	1
at	1
the	1
drape	1
of	1
the	1
day,)	1
Far	1
from	1
the	1
settlements	1
studying	1
the	1
print	1
of	1
animals'	1
feet,	1
or	1
the	1
moccasin	1
print,	1
By	1
the	1
cot	1
in	1
the	1
hospital	1
reaching	1
lemonade	1
to	1
a	1
feverish	1
patient,	1
Nigh	1
the	1
coffin'd	1
corpse	1
when	1
all	1
is	1
still,	1
examining	1
with	1
a	1
candle;	1
Voyaging	1
to	1
every	1
port	1
to	1
dicker	1
and	1
adventure,	1
Hurrying	1
with	1
the	1
modern	1
crowd	1
as	1
eager	1
and	1
fickle	1
as	1
any,	1
Hot	1
toward	1
one	1
I	1
hate,	1
ready	1
in	1
my	1
madness	1
to	1
knife	1
him,	1
Solitary	1
at	1
midnight	1
in	1
my	1
back	1
yard,	1
my	1
thoughts	1
gone	1
from	1
me	1
a	1
long	1
while,	1
Walking	1
the	1
old	1
hills	1
of	1
Judaea	1
with	1
the	1
beautiful	1
gentle	1
God	1
by	1
my	1
side,	1
Speeding	1
through	1
space,	1
speeding	1
through	1
heaven	1
and	1
the	1
stars,	1
Speeding	1
amid	1
the	1
seven	1
satellites	1
and	1
the	1
broad	1
ring,	1
and	1
the	1
diameter	1
of	1
eighty	1
thousand	1
miles,	1
Speeding	1
with	1
tail'd	1
meteors,	1
throwing	1
fire-balls	1
like	1
the	1
rest,	1
Carrying	1
the	1
crescent	1
child	1
that	1
carries	1
its	1
own	1
full	1
mother	1
in	1
its	1
belly,	1
Storming,	1
enjoying,	1
planning,	1
loving,	1
cautioning,	1
Backing	1
and	1
filling,	1
appearing	1
and	1
disappearing,	1
I	1
tread	1
day	1
and	1
night	1
such	1
roads.	1
I	1
visit	1
the	1
orchards	1
of	1
spheres	1
and	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
product,	1
And	1
look	1
at	1
quintillions	1
ripen'd	1
and	1
look	1
at	1
quintillions	1
green.	1
I	1
fly	1
those	1
flights	1
of	1
a	1
fluid	1
and	1
swallowing	1
soul,	1
My	1
course	1
runs	1
below	1
the	1
soundings	1
of	1
plummets.	1
I	1
help	1
myself	1
to	1
material	1
and	1
immaterial,	1
No	1
guard	1
can	1
shut	1
me	1
off,	1
no	1
law	1
prevent	1
me.	1
I	1
anchor	1
my	1
ship	1
for	1
a	1
little	1
while	1
only,	1
My	1
messengers	1
continually	1
cruise	1
away	1
or	1
bring	1
their	1
returns	1
to	1
me.	1
I	1
go	1
hunting	1
polar	1
furs	1
and	1
the	1
seal,	1
leaping	1
chasms	1
with	1
a	1
pike-pointed	1
staff,	1
clinging	1
to	1
topples	1
of	1
brittle	1
and	1
blue.	1
I	1
ascend	1
to	1
the	1
foretruck,	1
I	1
take	1
my	1
place	1
late	1
at	1
night	1
in	1
the	1
crow's-nest,	1
We	1
sail	1
the	1
arctic	1
sea,	1
it	1
is	1
plenty	1
light	1
enough,	1
Through	1
the	1
clear	1
atmosphere	1
I	1
stretch	1
around	1
on	1
the	1
wonderful	1
beauty,	1
The	1
enormous	1
masses	1
of	1
ice	1
pass	1
me	1
and	1
I	1
pass	1
them,	1
the	1
scenery	1
is	1
plain	1
in	1
all	1
directions,	1
The	1
white-topt	1
mountains	1
show	1
in	1
the	1
distance,	1
I	1
fling	1
out	1
my	1
fancies	1
toward	1
them,	1
We	1
are	1
approaching	1
some	1
great	1
battle-field	1
in	1
which	1
we	1
are	1
soon	1
to	1
be	1
engaged,	1
We	1
pass	1
the	1
colossal	1
outposts	1
of	1
the	1
encampment,	1
we	1
pass	1
with	1
still	1
feet	1
and	1
caution,	1
Or	1
we	1
are	1
entering	1
by	1
the	1
suburbs	1
some	1
vast	1
and	1
ruin'd	1
city,	1
The	1
blocks	1
and	1
fallen	1
architecture	1
more	1
than	1
all	1
the	1
living	1
cities	1
of	1
the	1
globe.	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
free	1
companion,	1
I	1
bivouac	1
by	1
invading	1
watchfires,	1
I	1
turn	1
the	1
bridgroom	1
out	1
of	1
bed	1
and	1
stay	1
with	1
the	1
bride	1
myself,	1
I	1
tighten	1
her	1
all	1
night	1
to	1
my	1
thighs	1
and	1
lips.	1
My	1
voice	1
is	1
the	1
wife's	1
voice,	1
the	1
screech	1
by	1
the	1
rail	1
of	1
the	1
stairs,	1
They	1
fetch	1
my	1
man's	1
body	1
up	1
dripping	1
and	1
drown'd.	1
I	1
understand	1
the	1
large	1
hearts	1
of	1
heroes,	1
The	1
courage	1
of	1
present	1
times	1
and	1
all	1
times,	1
How	1
the	1
skipper	1
saw	1
the	1
crowded	1
and	1
rudderless	1
wreck	1
of	1
the	1
steamship,	1
and	1
Death	1
chasing	1
it	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
storm,	1
How	1
he	1
knuckled	1
tight	1
and	1
gave	1
not	1
back	1
an	1
inch,	1
and	1
was	1
faithful	1
of	1
days	1
and	1
faithful	1
of	1
nights,	1
And	1
chalk'd	1
in	1
large	1
letters	1
on	1
a	1
board,	1
Be	1
of	1
good	1
cheer,	1
we	1
will	1
not	1
desert	1
you;	1
How	1
he	1
follow'd	1
with	1
them	1
and	1
tack'd	1
with	1
them	1
three	1
days	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
give	1
it	1
up,	1
How	1
he	1
saved	1
the	1
drifting	1
company	1
at	1
last,	1
How	1
the	1
lank	1
loose-gown'd	1
women	1
look'd	1
when	1
boated	1
from	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
their	1
prepared	1
graves,	1
How	1
the	1
silent	1
old-faced	1
infants	1
and	1
the	1
lifted	1
sick,	1
and	1
the	1
sharp-lipp'd	1
unshaved	1
men;	1
All	1
this	1
I	1
swallow,	1
it	1
tastes	1
good,	1
I	1
like	1
it	1
well,	1
it	1
becomes	1
mine,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
man,	1
I	1
suffer'd,	1
I	1
was	1
there.	1
The	1
disdain	1
and	1
calmness	1
of	1
martyrs,	1
The	1
mother	1
of	1
old,	1
condemn'd	1
for	1
a	1
witch,	1
burnt	1
with	1
dry	1
wood,	1
her	1
children	1
gazing	1
on,	1
The	1
hounded	1
slave	1
that	1
flags	1
in	1
the	1
race,	1
leans	1
by	1
the	1
fence,	1
blowing,	1
cover'd	1
with	1
sweat,	1
The	1
twinges	1
that	1
sting	1
like	1
needles	1
his	1
legs	1
and	1
neck,	1
the	1
murderous	1
buckshot	1
and	1
the	1
bullets,	1
All	1
these	1
I	1
feel	1
or	1
am.	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
hounded	1
slave,	1
I	1
wince	1
at	1
the	1
bite	1
of	1
the	1
dogs,	1
Hell	1
and	1
despair	1
are	1
upon	1
me,	1
crack	1
and	1
again	1
crack	1
the	1
marksmen,	1
I	1
clutch	1
the	1
rails	1
of	1
the	1
fence,	1
my	1
gore	1
dribs,	1
thinn'd	1
with	1
the	1
ooze	1
of	1
my	1
skin,	1
I	1
fall	1
on	1
the	1
weeds	1
and	1
stones,	1
The	1
riders	1
spur	1
their	1
unwilling	1
horses,	1
haul	1
close,	1
Taunt	1
my	1
dizzy	1
ears	1
and	1
beat	1
me	1
violently	1
over	1
the	1
head	1
with	1
whip-stocks.	1
Agonies	1
are	1
one	1
of	1
my	1
changes	1
of	1
garments,	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
ask	1
the	1
wounded	1
person	1
how	1
he	1
feels,	1
I	1
myself	1
become	1
the	1
wounded	1
person,	1
My	1
hurts	1
turn	1
livid	1
upon	1
me	1
as	1
I	1
lean	1
on	1
a	1
cane	1
and	1
observe.	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
mash'd	1
fireman	1
with	1
breast-bone	1
broken,	1
Tumbling	1
walls	1
buried	1
me	1
in	1
their	1
debris,	1
Heat	1
and	1
smoke	1
I	1
inspired,	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
yelling	1
shouts	1
of	1
my	1
comrades,	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
distant	1
click	1
of	1
their	1
picks	1
and	1
shovels,	1
They	1
have	1
clear'd	1
the	1
beams	1
away,	1
they	1
tenderly	1
lift	1
me	1
forth.	1
I	1
lie	1
in	1
the	1
night	1
air	1
in	1
my	1
red	1
shirt,	1
the	1
pervading	1
hush	1
is	1
for	1
my	1
sake,	1
Painless	1
after	1
all	1
I	1
lie	1
exhausted	1
but	1
not	1
so	1
unhappy,	1
White	1
and	1
beautiful	1
are	1
the	1
faces	1
around	1
me,	1
the	1
heads	1
are	1
bared	1
of	1
their	1
fire-caps,	1
The	1
kneeling	1
crowd	1
fades	1
with	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
torches.	1
Distant	1
and	1
dead	1
resuscitate,	1
They	1
show	1
as	1
the	1
dial	1
or	1
move	1
as	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
me,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
clock	1
myself.	1
I	1
am	1
an	1
old	1
artillerist,	1
I	1
tell	1
of	1
my	1
fort's	1
bombardment,	1
I	1
am	1
there	1
again.	1
Again	1
the	1
long	1
roll	1
of	1
the	1
drummers,	1
Again	1
the	1
attacking	1
cannon,	1
mortars,	1
Again	1
to	1
my	1
listening	1
ears	1
the	1
cannon	1
responsive.	1
I	1
take	1
part,	1
I	1
see	1
and	1
hear	1
the	1
whole,	1
The	1
cries,	1
curses,	1
roar,	1
the	1
plaudits	1
for	1
well-aim'd	1
shots,	1
The	1
ambulanza	1
slowly	1
passing	1
trailing	1
its	1
red	1
drip,	1
Workmen	1
searching	1
after	1
damages,	1
making	1
indispensable	1
repairs,	1
The	1
fall	1
of	1
grenades	1
through	1
the	1
rent	1
roof,	1
the	1
fan-shaped	1
explosion,	1
The	1
whizz	1
of	1
limbs,	1
heads,	1
stone,	1
wood,	1
iron,	1
high	1
in	1
the	1
air.	1
Again	1
gurgles	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
my	1
dying	1
general,	1
he	1
furiously	1
waves	1
with	1
his	1
hand,	1
He	1
gasps	1
through	1
the	1
clot	1
Mind	1
not	1
me--mind--the	1
entrenchments.	1
34	1
Now	1
I	1
tell	1
what	1
I	1
knew	1
in	1
Texas	1
in	1
my	1
early	1
youth,	1
(I	1
tell	1
not	1
the	1
fall	1
of	1
Alamo,	1
Not	1
one	1
escaped	1
to	1
tell	1
the	1
fall	1
of	1
Alamo,	1
The	1
hundred	1
and	1
fifty	1
are	1
dumb	1
yet	1
at	1
Alamo,)	1
'Tis	1
the	1
tale	1
of	1
the	1
murder	1
in	1
cold	1
blood	1
of	1
four	1
hundred	1
and	1
twelve	1
young	1
men.	1
Retreating	1
they	1
had	1
form'd	1
in	1
a	1
hollow	1
square	1
with	1
their	1
baggage	1
for	1
breastworks,	1
Nine	1
hundred	1
lives	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
surrounding	1
enemies,	1
nine	1
times	1
their	1
number,	1
was	1
the	1
price	1
they	1
took	1
in	1
advance,	1
Their	1
colonel	1
was	1
wounded	1
and	1
their	1
ammunition	1
gone,	1
They	1
treated	1
for	1
an	1
honorable	1
capitulation,	1
receiv'd	1
writing	1
and	1
seal,	1
gave	1
up	1
their	1
arms	1
and	1
march'd	1
back	1
prisoners	1
of	1
war.	1
They	1
were	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
race	1
of	1
rangers,	1
Matchless	1
with	1
horse,	1
rifle,	1
song,	1
supper,	1
courtship,	1
Large,	1
turbulent,	1
generous,	1
handsome,	1
proud,	1
and	1
affectionate,	1
Bearded,	1
sunburnt,	1
drest	1
in	1
the	1
free	1
costume	1
of	1
hunters,	1
Not	1
a	1
single	1
one	1
over	1
thirty	1
years	1
of	1
age.	1
The	1
second	1
First-day	1
morning	1
they	1
were	1
brought	1
out	1
in	1
squads	1
and	1
massacred,	1
it	1
was	1
beautiful	1
early	1
summer,	1
The	1
work	1
commenced	1
about	1
five	1
o'clock	1
and	1
was	1
over	1
by	1
eight.	1
None	1
obey'd	1
the	1
command	1
to	1
kneel,	1
Some	1
made	1
a	1
mad	1
and	1
helpless	1
rush,	1
some	1
stood	1
stark	1
and	1
straight,	1
A	1
few	1
fell	1
at	1
once,	1
shot	1
in	1
the	1
temple	1
or	1
heart,	1
the	1
living	1
and	1
dead	1
lay	1
together,	1
The	1
maim'd	1
and	1
mangled	1
dug	1
in	1
the	1
dirt,	1
the	1
new-comers	1
saw	1
them	1
there,	1
Some	1
half-kill'd	1
attempted	1
to	1
crawl	1
away,	1
These	1
were	1
despatch'd	1
with	1
bayonets	1
or	1
batter'd	1
with	1
the	1
blunts	1
of	1
muskets,	1
A	1
youth	1
not	1
seventeen	1
years	1
old	1
seiz'd	1
his	1
assassin	1
till	1
two	1
more	1
came	1
to	1
release	1
him,	1
The	1
three	1
were	1
all	1
torn	1
and	1
cover'd	1
with	1
the	1
boy's	1
blood.	1
At	1
eleven	1
o'clock	1
began	1
the	1
burning	1
of	1
the	1
bodies;	1
That	1
is	1
the	1
tale	1
of	1
the	1
murder	1
of	1
the	1
four	1
hundred	1
and	1
twelve	1
young	1
men.	1
35	1
Would	1
you	1
hear	1
of	1
an	1
old-time	1
sea-fight?	1
Would	1
you	1
learn	1
who	1
won	1
by	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
moon	1
and	1
stars?	1
List	1
to	1
the	1
yarn,	1
as	1
my	1
grandmother's	1
father	1
the	1
sailor	1
told	1
it	1
to	1
me.	1
Our	1
foe	1
was	1
no	1
sulk	1
in	1
his	1
ship	1
I	1
tell	1
you,	1
(said	1
he,)	1
His	1
was	1
the	1
surly	1
English	1
pluck,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
tougher	1
or	1
truer,	1
and	1
never	1
was,	1
and	1
never	1
will	1
be;	1
Along	1
the	1
lower'd	1
eve	1
he	1
came	1
horribly	1
raking	1
us.	1
We	1
closed	1
with	1
him,	1
the	1
yards	1
entangled,	1
the	1
cannon	1
touch'd,	1
My	1
captain	1
lash'd	1
fast	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
hands.	1
We	1
had	1
receiv'd	1
some	1
eighteen	1
pound	1
shots	1
under	1
the	1
water,	1
On	1
our	1
lower-gun-deck	1
two	1
large	1
pieces	1
had	1
burst	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
fire,	1
killing	1
all	1
around	1
and	1
blowing	1
up	1
overhead.	1
Fighting	1
at	1
sun-down,	1
fighting	1
at	1
dark,	1
Ten	1
o'clock	1
at	1
night,	1
the	1
full	1
moon	1
well	1
up,	1
our	1
leaks	1
on	1
the	1
gain,	1
and	1
five	1
feet	1
of	1
water	1
reported,	1
The	1
master-at-arms	1
loosing	1
the	1
prisoners	1
confined	1
in	1
the	1
after-hold	1
to	1
give	1
them	1
a	1
chance	1
for	1
themselves.	1
The	1
transit	1
to	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
magazine	1
is	1
now	1
stopt	1
by	1
the	1
sentinels,	1
They	1
see	1
so	1
many	1
strange	1
faces	1
they	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
whom	1
to	1
trust.	1
Our	1
frigate	1
takes	1
fire,	1
The	1
other	1
asks	1
if	1
we	1
demand	1
quarter?	1
If	1
our	1
colors	1
are	1
struck	1
and	1
the	1
fighting	1
done?	1
Now	1
I	1
laugh	1
content,	1
for	1
I	1
hear	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
my	1
little	1
captain,	1
We	1
have	1
not	1
struck,	1
he	1
composedly	1
cries,	1
we	1
have	1
just	1
begun	1
our	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
fighting.	1
Only	1
three	1
guns	1
are	1
in	1
use,	1
One	1
is	1
directed	1
by	1
the	1
captain	1
himself	1
against	1
the	1
enemy's	1
main-mast,	1
Two	1
well	1
serv'd	1
with	1
grape	1
and	1
canister	1
silence	1
his	1
musketry	1
and	1
clear	1
his	1
decks.	1
The	1
tops	1
alone	1
second	1
the	1
fire	1
of	1
this	1
little	1
battery,	1
especially	1
the	1
main-top,	1
They	1
hold	1
out	1
bravely	1
during	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
the	1
action.	1
Not	1
a	1
moment's	1
cease,	1
The	1
leaks	1
gain	1
fast	1
on	1
the	1
pumps,	1
the	1
fire	1
eats	1
toward	1
the	1
powder-magazine.	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
pumps	1
has	1
been	1
shot	1
away,	1
it	1
is	1
generally	1
thought	1
we	1
are	1
sinking.	1
Serene	1
stands	1
the	1
little	1
captain,	1
He	1
is	1
not	1
hurried,	1
his	1
voice	1
is	1
neither	1
high	1
nor	1
low,	1
His	1
eyes	1
give	1
more	1
light	1
to	1
us	1
than	1
our	1
battle-lanterns.	1
Toward	1
twelve	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
beams	1
of	1
the	1
moon	1
they	1
surrender	1
to	1
us.	1
36	1
Stretch'd	1
and	1
still	1
lies	1
the	1
midnight,	1
Two	1
great	1
hulls	1
motionless	1
on	1
the	1
breast	1
of	1
the	1
darkness,	1
Our	1
vessel	1
riddled	1
and	1
slowly	1
sinking,	1
preparations	1
to	1
pass	1
to	1
the	1
one	1
we	1
have	1
conquer'd,	1
The	1
captain	1
on	1
the	1
quarter-deck	1
coldly	1
giving	1
his	1
orders	1
through	1
a	1
countenance	1
white	1
as	1
a	1
sheet,	1
Near	1
by	1
the	1
corpse	1
of	1
the	1
child	1
that	1
serv'd	1
in	1
the	1
cabin,	1
The	1
dead	1
face	1
of	1
an	1
old	1
salt	1
with	1
long	1
white	1
hair	1
and	1
carefully	1
curl'd	1
whiskers,	1
The	1
flames	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
can	1
be	1
done	1
flickering	1
aloft	1
and	1
below,	1
The	1
husky	1
voices	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
officers	1
yet	1
fit	1
for	1
duty,	1
Formless	1
stacks	1
of	1
bodies	1
and	1
bodies	1
by	1
themselves,	1
dabs	1
of	1
flesh	1
upon	1
the	1
masts	1
and	1
spars,	1
Cut	1
of	1
cordage,	1
dangle	1
of	1
rigging,	1
slight	1
shock	1
of	1
the	1
soothe	1
of	1
waves,	1
Black	1
and	1
impassive	1
guns,	1
litter	1
of	1
powder-parcels,	1
strong	1
scent,	1
A	1
few	1
large	1
stars	1
overhead,	1
silent	1
and	1
mournful	1
shining,	1
Delicate	1
sniffs	1
of	1
sea-breeze,	1
smells	1
of	1
sedgy	1
grass	1
and	1
fields	1
by	1
the	1
shore,	1
death-messages	1
given	1
in	1
charge	1
to	1
survivors,	1
The	1
hiss	1
of	1
the	1
surgeon's	1
knife,	1
the	1
gnawing	1
teeth	1
of	1
his	1
saw,	1
Wheeze,	1
cluck,	1
swash	1
of	1
falling	1
blood,	1
short	1
wild	1
scream,	1
and	1
long,	1
dull,	1
tapering	1
groan,	1
These	1
so,	1
these	1
irretrievable.	1
37	1
You	1
laggards	1
there	1
on	1
guard!	1
look	1
to	1
your	1
arms!	1
In	1
at	1
the	1
conquer'd	1
doors	1
they	1
crowd!	1
I	1
am	1
possess'd!	1
Embody	1
all	1
presences	1
outlaw'd	1
or	1
suffering,	1
See	1
myself	1
in	1
prison	1
shaped	1
like	1
another	1
man,	1
And	1
feel	1
the	1
dull	1
unintermitted	1
pain.	1
For	1
me	1
the	1
keepers	1
of	1
convicts	1
shoulder	1
their	1
carbines	1
and	1
keep	1
watch,	1
It	1
is	1
I	1
let	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
and	1
barr'd	1
at	1
night.	1
Not	1
a	1
mutineer	1
walks	1
handcuff'd	1
to	1
jail	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
handcuff'd	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
walk	1
by	1
his	1
side,	1
(I	1
am	1
less	1
the	1
jolly	1
one	1
there,	1
and	1
more	1
the	1
silent	1
one	1
with	1
sweat	1
on	1
my	1
twitching	1
lips.)	1
Not	1
a	1
youngster	1
is	1
taken	1
for	1
larceny	1
but	1
I	1
go	1
up	1
too,	1
and	1
am	1
tried	1
and	1
sentenced.	1
Not	1
a	1
cholera	1
patient	1
lies	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
gasp	1
but	1
I	1
also	1
lie	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
gasp,	1
My	1
face	1
is	1
ash-color'd,	1
my	1
sinews	1
gnarl,	1
away	1
from	1
me	1
people	1
retreat.	1
Askers	1
embody	1
themselves	1
in	1
me	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
embodied	1
in	1
them,	1
I	1
project	1
my	1
hat,	1
sit	1
shame-faced,	1
and	1
beg.	1
38	1
Enough!	1
enough!	1
enough!	1
Somehow	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
stunn'd.	1
Stand	1
back!	1
Give	1
me	1
a	1
little	1
time	1
beyond	1
my	1
cuff'd	1
head,	1
slumbers,	1
dreams,	1
gaping,	1
I	1
discover	1
myself	1
on	1
the	1
verge	1
of	1
a	1
usual	1
mistake.	1
That	1
I	1
could	1
forget	1
the	1
mockers	1
and	1
insults!	1
That	1
I	1
could	1
forget	1
the	1
trickling	1
tears	1
and	1
the	1
blows	1
of	1
the	1
bludgeons	1
and	1
hammers!	1
That	1
I	1
could	1
look	1
with	1
a	1
separate	1
look	1
on	1
my	1
own	1
crucifixion	1
and	1
bloody	1
crowning.	1
I	1
remember	1
now,	1
I	1
resume	1
the	1
overstaid	1
fraction,	1
The	1
grave	1
of	1
rock	1
multiplies	1
what	1
has	1
been	1
confided	1
to	1
it,	1
or	1
to	1
any	1
graves,	1
Corpses	1
rise,	1
gashes	1
heal,	1
fastenings	1
roll	1
from	1
me.	1
I	1
troop	1
forth	1
replenish'd	1
with	1
supreme	1
power,	1
one	1
of	1
an	1
average	1
unending	1
procession,	1
Inland	1
and	1
sea-coast	1
we	1
go,	1
and	1
pass	1
all	1
boundary	1
lines,	1
Our	1
swift	1
ordinances	1
on	1
their	1
way	1
over	1
the	1
whole	1
earth,	1
The	1
blossoms	1
we	1
wear	1
in	1
our	1
hats	1
the	1
growth	1
of	1
thousands	1
of	1
years.	1
Eleves,	1
I	1
salute	1
you!	1
come	1
forward!	1
Continue	1
your	1
annotations,	1
continue	1
your	1
questionings.	1

The	1
friendly	1
and	1
flowing	1
savage,	1
who	1
is	1
he?	1
Is	1
he	1
waiting	1
for	1
civilization,	1
or	1
past	1
it	1
and	1
mastering	1
it?	1
Is	1
he	1
some	1
Southwesterner	1
rais'd	1
out-doors?	1
is	1
he	1
Kanadian?	1
Is	1
he	1
from	1
the	1
Mississippi	1
country?	1
Iowa,	1
Oregon,	1
California?	1
The	1
mountains?	1
prairie-life,	1
bush-life?	1
or	1
sailor	1
from	1
the	1
sea?	1
Wherever	1
he	1
goes	1
men	1
and	1
women	1
accept	1
and	1
desire	1
him,	1
They	1
desire	1
he	1
should	1
like	1
them,	1
touch	1
them,	1
speak	1
to	1
them,	1
stay	1
with	1
them.	1
Behavior	1
lawless	1
as	1
snow-flakes,	1
words	1
simple	1
as	1
grass,	1
uncomb'd	1
head,	1
laughter,	1
and	1
naivete,	1
Slow-stepping	1
feet,	1
common	1
features,	1
common	1
modes	1
and	1
emanations,	1
They	1
descend	1
in	1
new	1
forms	1
from	1
the	1
tips	1
of	1
his	1
fingers,	1
They	1
are	1
wafted	1
with	1
the	1
odor	1
of	1
his	1
body	1
or	1
breath,	1
they	1
fly	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
glance	1
of	1
his	1
eyes.	1
40	1
Flaunt	1
of	1
the	1
sunshine	1
I	1
need	1
not	1
your	1
bask--lie	1
over!	1
You	1
light	1
surfaces	1
only,	1
I	1
force	1
surfaces	1
and	1
depths	1
also.	1
Earth!	1
you	1
seem	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
something	1
at	1
my	1
hands,	1
Say,	1
old	1
top-knot,	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
want?	1
Man	1
or	1
woman,	1
I	1
might	1
tell	1
how	1
I	1
like	1
you,	1
but	1
cannot,	1
And	1
might	1
tell	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
me	1
and	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
you,	1
but	1
cannot,	1
And	1
might	1
tell	1
that	1
pining	1
I	1
have,	1
that	1
pulse	1
of	1
my	1
nights	1
and	1
days.	1
Behold,	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
give	1
lectures	1
or	1
a	1
little	1
charity,	1
When	1
I	1
give	1
I	1
give	1
myself.	1
You	1
there,	1
impotent,	1
loose	1
in	1
the	1
knees,	1
Open	1
your	1
scarf'd	1
chops	1
till	1
I	1
blow	1
grit	1
within	1
you,	1
Spread	1
your	1
palms	1
and	1
lift	1
the	1
flaps	1
of	1
your	1
pockets,	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
denied,	1
I	1
compel,	1
I	1
have	1
stores	1
plenty	1
and	1
to	1
spare,	1
And	1
any	1
thing	1
I	1
have	1
I	1
bestow.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
ask	1
who	1
you	1
are,	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
important	1
to	1
me,	1
You	1
can	1
do	1
nothing	1
and	1
be	1
nothing	1
but	1
what	1
I	1
will	1
infold	1
you.	1
To	1
cotton-field	1
drudge	1
or	1
cleaner	1
of	1
privies	1
I	1
lean,	1
On	1
his	1
right	1
cheek	1
I	1
put	1
the	1
family	1
kiss,	1
And	1
in	1
my	1
soul	1
I	1
swear	1
I	1
never	1
will	1
deny	1
him.	1
On	1
women	1
fit	1
for	1
conception	1
I	1
start	1
bigger	1
and	1
nimbler	1
babes.	1
(This	1
day	1
I	1
am	1
jetting	1
the	1
stuff	1
of	1
far	1
more	1
arrogant	1
republics.)	1
To	1
any	1
one	1
dying,	1
thither	1
I	1
speed	1
and	1
twist	1
the	1
knob	1
of	1
the	1
door.	1
Turn	1
the	1
bed-clothes	1
toward	1
the	1
foot	1
of	1
the	1
bed,	1
Let	1
the	1
physician	1
and	1
the	1
priest	1
go	1
home.	1
I	1
seize	1
the	1
descending	1
man	1
and	1
raise	1
him	1
with	1
resistless	1
will,	1
O	1
despairer,	1
here	1
is	1
my	1
neck,	1
By	1
God,	1
you	1
shall	1
not	1
go	1
down!	1
hang	1
your	1
whole	1
weight	1
upon	1
me.	1
I	1
dilate	1
you	1
with	1
tremendous	1
breath,	1
I	1
buoy	1
you	1
up,	1
Every	1
room	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
do	1
I	1
fill	1
with	1
an	1
arm'd	1
force,	1
Lovers	1
of	1
me,	1
bafflers	1
of	1
graves.	1
Sleep--I	1
and	1
they	1
keep	1
guard	1
all	1
night,	1
Not	1
doubt,	1
not	1
decease	1
shall	1
dare	1
to	1
lay	1
finger	1
upon	1
you,	1
I	1
have	1
embraced	1
you,	1
and	1
henceforth	1
possess	1
you	1
to	1
myself,	1
And	1
when	1
you	1
rise	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
you	1
will	1
find	1
what	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
is	1
so.	1
41	1
I	1
am	1
he	1
bringing	1
help	1
for	1
the	1
sick	1
as	1
they	1
pant	1
on	1
their	1
backs,	1
And	1
for	1
strong	1
upright	1
men	1
I	1
bring	1
yet	1
more	1
needed	1
help.	1
I	1
heard	1
what	1
was	1
said	1
of	1
the	1
universe,	1
Heard	1
it	1
and	1
heard	1
it	1
of	1
several	1
thousand	1
years;	1
It	1
is	1
middling	1
well	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
it	1
goes--but	1
is	1
that	1
all?	1
Magnifying	1
and	1
applying	1
come	1
I,	1
Outbidding	1
at	1
the	1
start	1
the	1
old	1
cautious	1
hucksters,	1
Taking	1
myself	1
the	1
exact	1
dimensions	1
of	1
Jehovah,	1
Lithographing	1
Kronos,	1
Zeus	1
his	1
son,	1
and	1
Hercules	1
his	1
grandson,	1
Buying	1
drafts	1
of	1
Osiris,	1
Isis,	1
Belus,	1
Brahma,	1
Buddha,	1
In	1
my	1
portfolio	1
placing	1
Manito	1
loose,	1
Allah	1
on	1
a	1
leaf,	1
the	1
crucifix	1
engraved,	1
With	1
Odin	1
and	1
the	1
hideous-faced	1
Mexitli	1
and	1
every	1
idol	1
and	1
image,	1
Taking	1
them	1
all	1
for	1
what	1
they	1
are	1
worth	1
and	1
not	1
a	1
cent	1
more,	1
Admitting	1
they	1
were	1
alive	1
and	1
did	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
their	1
days,	1
(They	1
bore	1
mites	1
as	1
for	1
unfledg'd	1
birds	1
who	1
have	1
now	1
to	1
rise	1
and	1
fly	1
and	1
sing	1
for	1
themselves,)	1
Accepting	1
the	1
rough	1
deific	1
sketches	1
to	1
fill	1
out	1
better	1
in	1
myself,	1
bestowing	1
them	1
freely	1
on	1
each	1
man	1
and	1
woman	1
I	1
see,	1
Discovering	1
as	1
much	1
or	1
more	1
in	1
a	1
framer	1
framing	1
a	1
house,	1
Putting	1
higher	1
claims	1
for	1
him	1
there	1
with	1
his	1
roll'd-up	1
sleeves	1
driving	1
the	1
mallet	1
and	1
chisel,	1
Not	1
objecting	1
to	1
special	1
revelations,	1
considering	1
a	1
curl	1
of	1
smoke	1
or	1
a	1
hair	1
on	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
my	1
hand	1
just	1
as	1
curious	1
as	1
any	1
revelation,	1
Lads	1
ahold	1
of	1
fire-engines	1
and	1
hook-and-ladder	1
ropes	1
no	1
less	1
to	1
me	1
than	1
the	1
gods	1
of	1
the	1
antique	1
wars,	1
Minding	1
their	1
voices	1
peal	1
through	1
the	1
crash	1
of	1
destruction,	1
Their	1
brawny	1
limbs	1
passing	1
safe	1
over	1
charr'd	1
laths,	1
their	1
white	1
foreheads	1
whole	1
and	1
unhurt	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
flames;	1
By	1
the	1
mechanic's	1
wife	1
with	1
her	1
babe	1
at	1
her	1
nipple	1
interceding	1
for	1
every	1
person	1
born,	1
Three	1
scythes	1
at	1
harvest	1
whizzing	1
in	1
a	1
row	1
from	1
three	1
lusty	1
angels	1
with	1
shirts	1
bagg'd	1
out	1
at	1
their	1
waists,	1
The	1
snag-tooth'd	1
hostler	1
with	1
red	1
hair	1
redeeming	1
sins	1
past	1
and	1
to	1
come,	1
Selling	1
all	1
he	1
possesses,	1
traveling	1
on	1
foot	1
to	1
fee	1
lawyers	1
for	1
his	1
brother	1
and	1
sit	1
by	1
him	1
while	1
he	1
is	1
tried	1
for	1
forgery;	1
What	1
was	1
strewn	1
in	1
the	1
amplest	1
strewing	1
the	1
square	1
rod	1
about	1
me,	1
and	1
not	1
filling	1
the	1
square	1
rod	1
then,	1
The	1
bull	1
and	1
the	1
bug	1
never	1
worshipp'd	1
half	1
enough,	1
Dung	1
and	1
dirt	1
more	1
admirable	1
than	1
was	1
dream'd,	1
The	1
supernatural	1
of	1
no	1
account,	1
myself	1
waiting	1
my	1
time	1
to	1
be	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
supremes,	1
The	1
day	1
getting	1
ready	1
for	1
me	1
when	1
I	1
shall	1
do	1
as	1
much	1
good	1
as	1
the	1
best,	1
and	1
be	1
as	1
prodigious;	1
By	1
my	1
life-lumps!	1
becoming	1
already	1
a	1
creator,	1
Putting	1
myself	1
here	1
and	1
now	1
to	1
the	1
ambush'd	1
womb	1
of	1
the	1
shadows.	1
42	1
A	1
call	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
crowd,	1
My	1
own	1
voice,	1
orotund	1
sweeping	1
and	1
final.	1
Come	1
my	1
children,	1
Come	1
my	1
boys	1
and	1
girls,	1
my	1
women,	1
household	1
and	1
intimates,	1
Now	1
the	1
performer	1
launches	1
his	1
nerve,	1
he	1
has	1
pass'd	1
his	1
prelude	1
on	1
the	1
reeds	1
within.	1
Easily	1
written	1
loose-finger'd	1
chords--I	1
feel	1
the	1
thrum	1
of	1
your	1
climax	1
and	1
close.	1
My	1
head	1
slues	1
round	1
on	1
my	1
neck,	1
Music	1
rolls,	1
but	1
not	1
from	1
the	1
organ,	1
Folks	1
are	1
around	1
me,	1
but	1
they	1
are	1
no	1
household	1
of	1
mine.	1
Ever	1
the	1
hard	1
unsunk	1
ground,	1
Ever	1
the	1
eaters	1
and	1
drinkers,	1
ever	1
the	1
upward	1
and	1
downward	1
sun,	1
ever	1
the	1
air	1
and	1
the	1
ceaseless	1
tides,	1
Ever	1
myself	1
and	1
my	1
neighbors,	1
refreshing,	1
wicked,	1
real,	1
Ever	1
the	1
old	1
inexplicable	1
query,	1
ever	1
that	1
thorn'd	1
thumb,	1
that	1
breath	1
of	1
itches	1
and	1
thirsts,	1
Ever	1
the	1
vexer's	1
hoot!	1
hoot!	1
till	1
we	1
find	1
where	1
the	1
sly	1
one	1
hides	1
and	1
bring	1
him	1
forth,	1
Ever	1
love,	1
ever	1
the	1
sobbing	1
liquid	1
of	1
life,	1
Ever	1
the	1
bandage	1
under	1
the	1
chin,	1
ever	1
the	1
trestles	1
of	1
death.	1
Here	1
and	1
there	1
with	1
dimes	1
on	1
the	1
eyes	1
walking,	1
To	1
feed	1
the	1
greed	1
of	1
the	1
belly	1
the	1
brains	1
liberally	1
spooning,	1
Tickets	1
buying,	1
taking,	1
selling,	1
but	1
in	1
to	1
the	1
feast	1
never	1
once	1
going,	1
Many	1
sweating,	1
ploughing,	1
thrashing,	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
chaff	1
for	1
payment	1
receiving,	1
A	1
few	1
idly	1
owning,	1
and	1
they	1
the	1
wheat	1
continually	1
claiming.	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
city	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
citizens,	1
Whatever	1
interests	1
the	1
rest	1
interests	1
me,	1
politics,	1
wars,	1
markets,	1
newspapers,	1
schools,	1
The	1
mayor	1
and	1
councils,	1
banks,	1
tariffs,	1
steamships,	1
factories,	1
stocks,	1
stores,	1
real	1
estate	1
and	1
personal	1
estate.	1
The	1
little	1
plentiful	1
manikins	1
skipping	1
around	1
in	1
collars	1
and	1
tail'd	1
coats	1
I	1
am	1
aware	1
who	1
they	1
are,	1
(they	1
are	1
positively	1
not	1
worms	1
or	1
fleas,)	1
I	1
acknowledge	1
the	1
duplicates	1
of	1
myself,	1
the	1
weakest	1
and	1
shallowest	1
is	1
deathless	1
with	1
me,	1
What	1
I	1
do	1
and	1
say	1
the	1
same	1
waits	1
for	1
them,	1
Every	1
thought	1
that	1
flounders	1
in	1
me	1
the	1
same	1
flounders	1
in	1
them.	1
I	1
know	1
perfectly	1
well	1
my	1
own	1
egotism,	1
Know	1
my	1
omnivorous	1
lines	1
and	1
must	1
not	1
write	1
any	1
less,	1
And	1
would	1
fetch	1
you	1
whoever	1
you	1
are	1
flush	1
with	1
myself.	1
Not	1
words	1
of	1
routine	1
this	1
song	1
of	1
mine,	1
But	1
abruptly	1
to	1
question,	1
to	1
leap	1
beyond	1
yet	1
nearer	1
bring;	1
This	1
printed	1
and	1
bound	1
book--but	1
the	1
printer	1
and	1
the	1
printing-office	1
boy?	1
The	1
well-taken	1
photographs--but	1
your	1
wife	1
or	1
friend	1
close	1
and	1
solid	1
in	1
your	1
arms?	1
The	1
black	1
ship	1
mail'd	1
with	1
iron,	1
her	1
mighty	1
guns	1
in	1
her	1
turrets--but	1
the	1
pluck	1
of	1
the	1
captain	1
and	1
engineers?	1
In	1
the	1
houses	1
the	1
dishes	1
and	1
fare	1
and	1
furniture--but	1
the	1
host	1
and	1
hostess,	1
and	1
the	1
look	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
eyes?	1
The	1
sky	1
up	1
there--yet	1
here	1
or	1
next	1
door,	1
or	1
across	1
the	1
way?	1
The	1
saints	1
and	1
sages	1
in	1
history--but	1
you	1
yourself?	1
Sermons,	1
creeds,	1
theology--but	1
the	1
fathomless	1
human	1
brain,	1
And	1
what	1
is	1
reason?	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
love?	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
life?	1
43	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
despise	1
you	1
priests,	1
all	1
time,	1
the	1
world	1
over,	1
My	1
faith	1
is	1
the	1
greatest	1
of	1
faiths	1
and	1
the	1
least	1
of	1
faiths,	1
Enclosing	1
worship	1
ancient	1
and	1
modern	1
and	1
all	1
between	1
ancient	1
and	1
modern,	1
Believing	1
I	1
shall	1
come	1
again	1
upon	1
the	1
earth	1
after	1
five	1
thousand	1
years,	1
Waiting	1
responses	1
from	1
oracles,	1
honoring	1
the	1
gods,	1
saluting	1
the	1
sun,	1
Making	1
a	1
fetich	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
rock	1
or	1
stump,	1
powowing	1
with	1
sticks	1
in	1
the	1
circle	1
of	1
obis,	1
Helping	1
the	1
llama	1
or	1
brahmin	1
as	1
he	1
trims	1
the	1
lamps	1
of	1
the	1
idols,	1
Dancing	1
yet	1
through	1
the	1
streets	1
in	1
a	1
phallic	1
procession,	1
rapt	1
and	1
austere	1
in	1
the	1
woods	1
a	1
gymnosophist,	1
Drinking	1
mead	1
from	1
the	1
skull-cap,	1
to	1
Shastas	1
and	1
Vedas	1
admirant,	1
minding	1
the	1
Koran,	1
Walking	1
the	1
teokallis,	1
spotted	1
with	1
gore	1
from	1
the	1
stone	1
and	1
knife,	1
beating	1
the	1
serpent-skin	1
drum,	1
Accepting	1
the	1
Gospels,	1
accepting	1
him	1
that	1
was	1
crucified,	1
knowing	1
assuredly	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
divine,	1
To	1
the	1
mass	1
kneeling	1
or	1
the	1
puritan's	1
prayer	1
rising,	1
or	1
sitting	1
patiently	1
in	1
a	1
pew,	1
Ranting	1
and	1
frothing	1
in	1
my	1
insane	1
crisis,	1
or	1
waiting	1
dead-like	1
till	1
my	1
spirit	1
arouses	1
me,	1
Looking	1
forth	1
on	1
pavement	1
and	1
land,	1
or	1
outside	1
of	1
pavement	1
and	1
land,	1
Belonging	1
to	1
the	1
winders	1
of	1
the	1
circuit	1
of	1
circuits.	1
One	1
of	1
that	1
centripetal	1
and	1
centrifugal	1
gang	1
I	1
turn	1
and	1
talk	1
like	1
man	1
leaving	1
charges	1
before	1
a	1
journey.	1
Down-hearted	1
doubters	1
dull	1
and	1
excluded,	1
Frivolous,	1
sullen,	1
moping,	1
angry,	1
affected,	1
dishearten'd,	1
atheistical,	1
I	1
know	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
you,	1
I	1
know	1
the	1
sea	1
of	1
torment,	1
doubt,	1
despair	1
and	1
unbelief.	1
How	1
the	1
flukes	1
splash!	1
How	1
they	1
contort	1
rapid	1
as	1
lightning,	1
with	1
spasms	1
and	1
spouts	1
of	1
blood!	1
Be	1
at	1
peace	1
bloody	1
flukes	1
of	1
doubters	1
and	1
sullen	1
mopers,	1
I	1
take	1
my	1
place	1
among	1
you	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
among	1
any,	1
The	1
past	1
is	1
the	1
push	1
of	1
you,	1
me,	1
all,	1
precisely	1
the	1
same,	1
And	1
what	1
is	1
yet	1
untried	1
and	1
afterward	1
is	1
for	1
you,	1
me,	1
all,	1
precisely	1
the	1
same.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
is	1
untried	1
and	1
afterward,	1
But	1
I	1
know	1
it	1
will	1
in	1
its	1
turn	1
prove	1
sufficient,	1
and	1
cannot	1
fail.	1
Each	1
who	1
passes	1
is	1
consider'd,	1
each	1
who	1
stops	1
is	1
consider'd,	1
not	1
single	1
one	1
can	1
it	1
fall.	1
It	1
cannot	1
fall	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
who	1
died	1
and	1
was	1
buried,	1
Nor	1
the	1
young	1
woman	1
who	1
died	1
and	1
was	1
put	1
by	1
his	1
side,	1
Nor	1
the	1
little	1
child	1
that	1
peep'd	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
then	1
drew	1
back	1
and	1
was	1
never	1
seen	1
again,	1
Nor	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
who	1
has	1
lived	1
without	1
purpose,	1
and	1
feels	1
it	1
with	1
bitterness	1
worse	1
than	1
gall,	1
Nor	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
poor	1
house	1
tubercled	1
by	1
rum	1
and	1
the	1
bad	1
disorder,	1
Nor	1
the	1
numberless	1
slaughter'd	1
and	1
wreck'd,	1
nor	1
the	1
brutish	1
koboo	1
call'd	1
the	1
ordure	1
of	1
humanity,	1
Nor	1
the	1
sacs	1
merely	1
floating	1
with	1
open	1
mouths	1
for	1
food	1
to	1
slip	1
in,	1
Nor	1
any	1
thing	1
in	1
the	1
earth,	1
or	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
oldest	1
graves	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
Nor	1
any	1
thing	1
in	1
the	1
myriads	1
of	1
spheres,	1
nor	1
the	1
myriads	1
of	1
myriads	1
that	1
inhabit	1
them,	1
Nor	1
the	1
present,	1
nor	1
the	1
least	1
wisp	1
that	1
is	1
known.	1
44	1
It	1
is	1
time	1
to	1
explain	1
myself--let	1
us	1
stand	1
up.	1
What	1
is	1
known	1
I	1
strip	1
away,	1
I	1
launch	1
all	1
men	1
and	1
women	1
forward	1
with	1
me	1
into	1
the	1
Unknown.	1
The	1
clock	1
indicates	1
the	1
moment--but	1
what	1
does	1
eternity	1
indicate?	1
We	1
have	1
thus	1
far	1
exhausted	1
trillions	1
of	1
winters	1
and	1
summers,	1
There	1
are	1
trillions	1
ahead,	1
and	1
trillions	1
ahead	1
of	1
them.	1
Births	1
have	1
brought	1
us	1
richness	1
and	1
variety,	1
And	1
other	1
births	1
will	1
bring	1
us	1
richness	1
and	1
variety.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
call	1
one	1
greater	1
and	1
one	1
smaller,	1
That	1
which	1
fills	1
its	1
period	1
and	1
place	1
is	1
equal	1
to	1
any.	1
Were	1
mankind	1
murderous	1
or	1
jealous	1
upon	1
you,	1
my	1
brother,	1
my	1
sister?	1
I	1
am	1
sorry	1
for	1
you,	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
murderous	1
or	1
jealous	1
upon	1
me,	1
All	1
has	1
been	1
gentle	1
with	1
me,	1
I	1
keep	1
no	1
account	1
with	1
lamentation,	1
(What	1
have	1
I	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
lamentation?)	1
I	1
am	1
an	1
acme	1
of	1
things	1
accomplish'd,	1
and	1
I	1
an	1
encloser	1
of	1
things	1
to	1
be.	1
My	1
feet	1
strike	1
an	1
apex	1
of	1
the	1
apices	1
of	1
the	1
stairs,	1
On	1
every	1
step	1
bunches	1
of	1
ages,	1
and	1
larger	1
bunches	1
between	1
the	1
steps,	1
All	1
below	1
duly	1
travel'd,	1
and	1
still	1
I	1
mount	1
and	1
mount.	1
Rise	1
after	1
rise	1
bow	1
the	1
phantoms	1
behind	1
me,	1
Afar	1
down	1
I	1
see	1
the	1
huge	1
first	1
Nothing,	1
I	1
know	1
I	1
was	1
even	1
there,	1
I	1
waited	1
unseen	1
and	1
always,	1
and	1
slept	1
through	1
the	1
lethargic	1
mist,	1
And	1
took	1
my	1
time,	1
and	1
took	1
no	1
hurt	1
from	1
the	1
fetid	1
carbon.	1
Long	1
I	1
was	1
hugg'd	1
close--long	1
and	1
long.	1
Immense	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
preparations	1
for	1
me,	1
Faithful	1
and	1
friendly	1
the	1
arms	1
that	1
have	1
help'd	1
me.	1
Cycles	1
ferried	1
my	1
cradle,	1
rowing	1
and	1
rowing	1
like	1
cheerful	1
boatmen,	1
For	1
room	1
to	1
me	1
stars	1
kept	1
aside	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
rings,	1
They	1
sent	1
influences	1
to	1
look	1
after	1
what	1
was	1
to	1
hold	1
me.	1
Before	1
I	1
was	1
born	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
mother	1
generations	1
guided	1
me,	1
My	1
embryo	1
has	1
never	1
been	1
torpid,	1
nothing	1
could	1
overlay	1
it.	1
For	1
it	1
the	1
nebula	1
cohered	1
to	1
an	1
orb,	1
The	1
long	1
slow	1
strata	1
piled	1
to	1
rest	1
it	1
on,	1
Vast	1
vegetables	1
gave	1
it	1
sustenance,	1
Monstrous	1
sauroids	1
transported	1
it	1
in	1
their	1
mouths	1
and	1
deposited	1
it	1
with	1
care.	1
All	1
forces	1
have	1
been	1
steadily	1
employ'd	1
to	1
complete	1
and	1
delight	1
me,	1
Now	1
on	1
this	1
spot	1
I	1
stand	1
with	1
my	1
robust	1
soul.	1
45	1
O	1
span	1
of	1
youth!	1
ever-push'd	1
elasticity!	1
O	1
manhood,	1
balanced,	1
florid	1
and	1
full.	1
My	1
lovers	1
suffocate	1
me,	1
Crowding	1
my	1
lips,	1
thick	1
in	1
the	1
pores	1
of	1
my	1
skin,	1
Jostling	1
me	1
through	1
streets	1
and	1
public	1
halls,	1
coming	1
naked	1
to	1
me	1
at	1
night,	1
Crying	1
by	1
day,	1
Ahoy!	1
from	1
the	1
rocks	1
of	1
the	1
river,	1
swinging	1
and	1
chirping	1
over	1
my	1
head,	1
Calling	1
my	1
name	1
from	1
flower-beds,	1
vines,	1
tangled	1
underbrush,	1
Lighting	1
on	1
every	1
moment	1
of	1
my	1
life,	1
Bussing	1
my	1
body	1
with	1
soft	1
balsamic	1
busses,	1
Noiselessly	1
passing	1
handfuls	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
hearts	1
and	1
giving	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
mine.	1
Old	1
age	1
superbly	1
rising!	1
O	1
welcome,	1
ineffable	1
grace	1
of	1
dying	1
days!	1
Every	1
condition	1
promulges	1
not	1
only	1
itself,	1
it	1
promulges	1
what	1
grows	1
after	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
itself,	1
And	1
the	1
dark	1
hush	1
promulges	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
any.	1
I	1
open	1
my	1
scuttle	1
at	1
night	1
and	1
see	1
the	1
far-sprinkled	1
systems,	1
And	1
all	1
I	1
see	1
multiplied	1
as	1
high	1
as	1
I	1
can	1
cipher	1
edge	1
but	1
the	1
rim	1
of	1
the	1
farther	1
systems.	1
Wider	1
and	1
wider	1
they	1
spread,	1
expanding,	1
always	1
expanding,	1
Outward	1
and	1
outward	1
and	1
forever	1
outward.	1
My	1
sun	1
has	1
his	1
sun	1
and	1
round	1
him	1
obediently	1
wheels,	1
He	1
joins	1
with	1
his	1
partners	1
a	1
group	1
of	1
superior	1
circuit,	1
And	1
greater	1
sets	1
follow,	1
making	1
specks	1
of	1
the	1
greatest	1
inside	1
them.	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
stoppage	1
and	1
never	1
can	1
be	1
stoppage,	1
If	1
I,	1
you,	1
and	1
the	1
worlds,	1
and	1
all	1
beneath	1
or	1
upon	1
their	1
surfaces,	1
were	1
this	1
moment	1
reduced	1
back	1
to	1
a	1
pallid	1
float,	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
avail	1
the	1
long	1
run,	1
We	1
should	1
surely	1
bring	1
up	1
again	1
where	1
we	1
now	1
stand,	1
And	1
surely	1
go	1
as	1
much	1
farther,	1
and	1
then	1
farther	1
and	1
farther.	1
A	1
few	1
quadrillions	1
of	1
eras,	1
a	1
few	1
octillions	1
of	1
cubic	1
leagues,	1
do	1
not	1
hazard	1
the	1
span	1
or	1
make	1
it	1
impatient,	1
They	1
are	1
but	1
parts,	1
any	1
thing	1
is	1
but	1
a	1
part.	1
See	1
ever	1
so	1
far,	1
there	1
is	1
limitless	1
space	1
outside	1
of	1
that,	1
Count	1
ever	1
so	1
much,	1
there	1
is	1
limitless	1
time	1
around	1
that.	1
My	1
rendezvous	1
is	1
appointed,	1
it	1
is	1
certain,	1
The	1
Lord	1
will	1
be	1
there	1
and	1
wait	1
till	1
I	1
come	1
on	1
perfect	1
terms,	1
The	1
great	1
Camerado,	1
the	1
lover	1
true	1
for	1
whom	1
I	1
pine	1
will	1
be	1
there.	1
46	1
I	1
know	1
I	1
have	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
time	1
and	1
space,	1
and	1
was	1
never	1
measured	1
and	1
never	1
will	1
be	1
measured.	1
I	1
tramp	1
a	1
perpetual	1
journey,	1
(come	1
listen	1
all!)	1
My	1
signs	1
are	1
a	1
rain-proof	1
coat,	1
good	1
shoes,	1
and	1
a	1
staff	1
cut	1
from	1
the	1
woods,	1
No	1
friend	1
of	1
mine	1
takes	1
his	1
ease	1
in	1
my	1
chair,	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
chair,	1
no	1
church,	1
no	1
philosophy,	1
I	1
lead	1
no	1
man	1
to	1
a	1
dinner-table,	1
library,	1
exchange,	1
But	1
each	1
man	1
and	1
each	1
woman	1
of	1
you	1
I	1
lead	1
upon	1
a	1
knoll,	1
My	1
left	1
hand	1
hooking	1
you	1
round	1
the	1
waist,	1
My	1
right	1
hand	1
pointing	1
to	1
landscapes	1
of	1
continents	1
and	1
the	1
public	1
road.	1
Not	1
I,	1
not	1
any	1
one	1
else	1
can	1
travel	1
that	1
road	1
for	1
you,	1
You	1
must	1
travel	1
it	1
for	1
yourself.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
far,	1
it	1
is	1
within	1
reach,	1
Perhaps	1
you	1
have	1
been	1
on	1
it	1
since	1
you	1
were	1
born	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
know,	1
Perhaps	1
it	1
is	1
everywhere	1
on	1
water	1
and	1
on	1
land.	1
Shoulder	1
your	1
duds	1
dear	1
son,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
mine,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
hasten	1
forth,	1
Wonderful	1
cities	1
and	1
free	1
nations	1
we	1
shall	1
fetch	1
as	1
we	1
go.	1
If	1
you	1
tire,	1
give	1
me	1
both	1
burdens,	1
and	1
rest	1
the	1
chuff	1
of	1
your	1
hand	1
on	1
my	1
hip,	1
And	1
in	1
due	1
time	1
you	1
shall	1
repay	1
the	1
same	1
service	1
to	1
me,	1
For	1
after	1
we	1
start	1
we	1
never	1
lie	1
by	1
again.	1
This	1
day	1
before	1
dawn	1
I	1
ascended	1
a	1
hill	1
and	1
look'd	1
at	1
the	1
crowded	1
heaven,	1
And	1
I	1
said	1
to	1
my	1
spirit	1
When	1
we	1
become	1
the	1
enfolders	1
of	1
those	1
orbs,	1
and	1
the	1
pleasure	1
and	1
knowledge	1
of	1
every	1
thing	1
in	1
them,	1
shall	1
we	1
be	1
fill'd	1
and	1
satisfied	1
then?	1
And	1
my	1
spirit	1
said	1
No,	1
we	1
but	1
level	1
that	1
lift	1
to	1
pass	1
and	1
continue	1
beyond.	1
You	1
are	1
also	1
asking	1
me	1
questions	1
and	1
I	1
hear	1
you,	1
I	1
answer	1
that	1
I	1
cannot	1
answer,	1
you	1
must	1
find	1
out	1
for	1
yourself.	1
Sit	1
a	1
while	1
dear	1
son,	1
Here	1
are	1
biscuits	1
to	1
eat	1
and	1
here	1
is	1
milk	1
to	1
drink,	1
But	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
you	1
sleep	1
and	1
renew	1
yourself	1
in	1
sweet	1
clothes,	1
I	1
kiss	1
you	1
with	1
a	1
good-by	1
kiss	1
and	1
open	1
the	1
gate	1
for	1
your	1
egress	1
hence.	1
Long	1
enough	1
have	1
you	1
dream'd	1
contemptible	1
dreams,	1
Now	1
I	1
wash	1
the	1
gum	1
from	1
your	1
eyes,	1
You	1
must	1
habit	1
yourself	1
to	1
the	1
dazzle	1
of	1
the	1
light	1
and	1
of	1
every	1
moment	1
of	1
your	1
life.	1
Long	1
have	1
you	1
timidly	1
waded	1
holding	1
a	1
plank	1
by	1
the	1
shore,	1
Now	1
I	1
will	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
bold	1
swimmer,	1
To	1
jump	1
off	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
rise	1
again,	1
nod	1
to	1
me,	1
shout,	1
and	1
laughingly	1
dash	1
with	1
your	1
hair.	1

I	1
am	1
the	1
teacher	1
of	1
athletes,	1
He	1
that	1
by	1
me	1
spreads	1
a	1
wider	1
breast	1
than	1
my	1
own	1
proves	1
the	1
width	1
of	1
my	1
own,	1
He	1
most	1
honors	1
my	1
style	1
who	1
learns	1
under	1
it	1
to	1
destroy	1
the	1
teacher.	1
The	1
boy	1
I	1
love,	1
the	1
same	1
becomes	1
a	1
man	1
not	1
through	1
derived	1
power,	1
but	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
right,	1
Wicked	1
rather	1
than	1
virtuous	1
out	1
of	1
conformity	1
or	1
fear,	1
Fond	1
of	1
his	1
sweetheart,	1
relishing	1
well	1
his	1
steak,	1
Unrequited	1
love	1
or	1
a	1
slight	1
cutting	1
him	1
worse	1
than	1
sharp	1
steel	1
cuts,	1
First-rate	1
to	1
ride,	1
to	1
fight,	1
to	1
hit	1
the	1
bull's	1
eye,	1
to	1
sail	1
a	1
skiff,	1
to	1
sing	1
a	1
song	1
or	1
play	1
on	1
the	1
banjo,	1
Preferring	1
scars	1
and	1
the	1
beard	1
and	1
faces	1
pitted	1
with	1
small-pox	1
over	1
all	1
latherers,	1
And	1
those	1
well-tann'd	1
to	1
those	1
that	1
keep	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
sun.	1
I	1
teach	1
straying	1
from	1
me,	1
yet	1
who	1
can	1
stray	1
from	1
me?	1
I	1
follow	1
you	1
whoever	1
you	1
are	1
from	1
the	1
present	1
hour,	1
My	1
words	1
itch	1
at	1
your	1
ears	1
till	1
you	1
understand	1
them.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
say	1
these	1
things	1
for	1
a	1
dollar	1
or	1
to	1
fill	1
up	1
the	1
time	1
while	1
I	1
wait	1
for	1
a	1
boat,	1
(It	1
is	1
you	1
talking	1
just	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
myself,	1
I	1
act	1
as	1
the	1
tongue	1
of	1
you,	1
Tied	1
in	1
your	1
mouth,	1
in	1
mine	1
it	1
begins	1
to	1
be	1
loosen'd.)	1
I	1
swear	1
I	1
will	1
never	1
again	1
mention	1
love	1
or	1
death	1
inside	1
a	1
house,	1
And	1
I	1
swear	1
I	1
will	1
never	1
translate	1
myself	1
at	1
all,	1
only	1
to	1
him	1
or	1
her	1
who	1
privately	1
stays	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
open	1
air.	1
If	1
you	1
would	1
understand	1
me	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
heights	1
or	1
water-shore,	1
The	1
nearest	1
gnat	1
is	1
an	1
explanation,	1
and	1
a	1
drop	1
or	1
motion	1
of	1
waves	1
key,	1
The	1
maul,	1
the	1
oar,	1
the	1
hand-saw,	1
second	1
my	1
words.	1
No	1
shutter'd	1
room	1
or	1
school	1
can	1
commune	1
with	1
me,	1
But	1
roughs	1
and	1
little	1
children	1
better	1
than	1
they.	1
The	1
young	1
mechanic	1
is	1
closest	1
to	1
me,	1
he	1
knows	1
me	1
well,	1
The	1
woodman	1
that	1
takes	1
his	1
axe	1
and	1
jug	1
with	1
him	1
shall	1
take	1
me	1
with	1
him	1
all	1
day,	1
The	1
farm-boy	1
ploughing	1
in	1
the	1
field	1
feels	1
good	1
at	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
my	1
voice,	1
In	1
vessels	1
that	1
sail	1
my	1
words	1
sail,	1
I	1
go	1
with	1
fishermen	1
and	1
seamen	1
and	1
love	1
them.	1
The	1
soldier	1
camp'd	1
or	1
upon	1
the	1
march	1
is	1
mine,	1
On	1
the	1
night	1
ere	1
the	1
pending	1
battle	1
many	1
seek	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
fail	1
them,	1
On	1
that	1
solemn	1
night	1
(it	1
may	1
be	1
their	1
last)	1
those	1
that	1
know	1
me	1
seek	1
me.	1
My	1
face	1
rubs	1
to	1
the	1
hunter's	1
face	1
when	1
he	1
lies	1
down	1
alone	1
in	1
his	1
blanket,	1
The	1
driver	1
thinking	1
of	1
me	1
does	1
not	1
mind	1
the	1
jolt	1
of	1
his	1
wagon,	1
The	1
young	1
mother	1
and	1
old	1
mother	1
comprehend	1
me,	1
The	1
girl	1
and	1
the	1
wife	1
rest	1
the	1
needle	1
a	1
moment	1
and	1
forget	1
where	1
they	1
are,	1
They	1
and	1
all	1
would	1
resume	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
told	1
them.	1
48	1
I	1
have	1
said	1
that	1
the	1
soul	1
is	1
not	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
body,	1
And	1
I	1
have	1
said	1
that	1
the	1
body	1
is	1
not	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
soul,	1
And	1
nothing,	1
not	1
God,	1
is	1
greater	1
to	1
one	1
than	1
one's	1
self	1
is,	1
And	1
whoever	1
walks	1
a	1
furlong	1
without	1
sympathy	1
walks	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
funeral	1
drest	1
in	1
his	1
shroud,	1
And	1
I	1
or	1
you	1
pocketless	1
of	1
a	1
dime	1
may	1
purchase	1
the	1
pick	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
And	1
to	1
glance	1
with	1
an	1
eye	1
or	1
show	1
a	1
bean	1
in	1
its	1
pod	1
confounds	1
the	1
learning	1
of	1
all	1
times,	1
And	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
trade	1
or	1
employment	1
but	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
following	1
it	1
may	1
become	1
a	1
hero,	1
And	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
object	1
so	1
soft	1
but	1
it	1
makes	1
a	1
hub	1
for	1
the	1
wheel'd	1
universe,	1
And	1
I	1
say	1
to	1
any	1
man	1
or	1
woman,	1
Let	1
your	1
soul	1
stand	1
cool	1
and	1
composed	1
before	1
a	1
million	1
universes.	1
And	1
I	1
say	1
to	1
mankind,	1
Be	1
not	1
curious	1
about	1
God,	1
For	1
I	1
who	1
am	1
curious	1
about	1
each	1
am	1
not	1
curious	1
about	1
God,	1
(No	1
array	1
of	1
terms	1
can	1
say	1
how	1
much	1
I	1
am	1
at	1
peace	1
about	1
God	1
and	1
about	1
death.)	1
I	1
hear	1
and	1
behold	1
God	1
in	1
every	1
object,	1
yet	1
understand	1
God	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
least,	1
Nor	1
do	1
I	1
understand	1
who	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
more	1
wonderful	1
than	1
myself.	1
Why	1
should	1
I	1
wish	1
to	1
see	1
God	1
better	1
than	1
this	1
day?	1
I	1
see	1
something	1
of	1
God	1
each	1
hour	1
of	1
the	1
twenty-four,	1
and	1
each	1
moment	1
then,	1
In	1
the	1
faces	1
of	1
men	1
and	1
women	1
I	1
see	1
God,	1
and	1
in	1
my	1
own	1
face	1
in	1
the	1
glass,	1
I	1
find	1
letters	1
from	1
God	1
dropt	1
in	1
the	1
street,	1
and	1
every	1
one	1
is	1
sign'd	1
by	1
God's	1
name,	1
And	1
I	1
leave	1
them	1
where	1
they	1
are,	1
for	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
wheresoe'er	1
I	1
go,	1
Others	1
will	1
punctually	1
come	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
49	1
And	1
as	1
to	1
you	1
Death,	1
and	1
you	1
bitter	1
hug	1
of	1
mortality,	1
it	1
is	1
idle	1
to	1
try	1
to	1
alarm	1
me.	1
To	1
his	1
work	1
without	1
flinching	1
the	1
accoucheur	1
comes,	1
I	1
see	1
the	1
elder-hand	1
pressing	1
receiving	1
supporting,	1
I	1
recline	1
by	1
the	1
sills	1
of	1
the	1
exquisite	1
flexible	1
doors,	1
And	1
mark	1
the	1
outlet,	1
and	1
mark	1
the	1
relief	1
and	1
escape.	1
And	1
as	1
to	1
you	1
Corpse	1
I	1
think	1
you	1
are	1
good	1
manure,	1
but	1
that	1
does	1
not	1
offend	1
me,	1
I	1
smell	1
the	1
white	1
roses	1
sweet-scented	1
and	1
growing,	1
I	1
reach	1
to	1
the	1
leafy	1
lips,	1
I	1
reach	1
to	1
the	1
polish'd	1
breasts	1
of	1
melons.	1
And	1
as	1
to	1
you	1
Life	1
I	1
reckon	1
you	1
are	1
the	1
leavings	1
of	1
many	1
deaths,	1
(No	1
doubt	1
I	1
have	1
died	1
myself	1
ten	1
thousand	1
times	1
before.)	1
I	1
hear	1
you	1
whispering	1
there	1
O	1
stars	1
of	1
heaven,	1
O	1
suns--O	1
grass	1
of	1
graves--O	1
perpetual	1
transfers	1
and	1
promotions,	1
If	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
say	1
any	1
thing	1
how	1
can	1
I	1
say	1
any	1
thing?	1
Of	1
the	1
turbid	1
pool	1
that	1
lies	1
in	1
the	1
autumn	1
forest,	1
Of	1
the	1
moon	1
that	1
descends	1
the	1
steeps	1
of	1
the	1
soughing	1
twilight,	1
Toss,	1
sparkles	1
of	1
day	1
and	1
dusk--toss	1
on	1
the	1
black	1
stems	1
that	1
decay	1
in	1
the	1
muck,	1
Toss	1
to	1
the	1
moaning	1
gibberish	1
of	1
the	1
dry	1
limbs.	1
I	1
ascend	1
from	1
the	1
moon,	1
I	1
ascend	1
from	1
the	1
night,	1
I	1
perceive	1
that	1
the	1
ghastly	1
glimmer	1
is	1
noonday	1
sunbeams	1
reflected,	1
And	1
debouch	1
to	1
the	1
steady	1
and	1
central	1
from	1
the	1
offspring	1
great	1
or	1
small.	1
50	1
There	1
is	1
that	1
in	1
me--I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
it	1
is--but	1
I	1
know	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
me.	1
Wrench'd	1
and	1
sweaty--calm	1
and	1
cool	1
then	1
my	1
body	1
becomes,	1
I	1
sleep--I	1
sleep	1
long.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
it--it	1
is	1
without	1
name--it	1
is	1
a	1
word	1
unsaid,	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
any	1
dictionary,	1
utterance,	1
symbol.	1
Something	1
it	1
swings	1
on	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
earth	1
I	1
swing	1
on,	1
To	1
it	1
the	1
creation	1
is	1
the	1
friend	1
whose	1
embracing	1
awakes	1
me.	1
Perhaps	1
I	1
might	1
tell	1
more.	1
Outlines!	1
I	1
plead	1
for	1
my	1
brothers	1
and	1
sisters.	1
Do	1
you	1
see	1
O	1
my	1
brothers	1
and	1
sisters?	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
chaos	1
or	1
death--it	1
is	1
form,	1
union,	1
plan--it	1
is	1
eternal	1
life--it	1
is	1
Happiness.	1
51	1
The	1
past	1
and	1
present	1
wilt--I	1
have	1
fill'd	1
them,	1
emptied	1
them.	1
And	1
proceed	1
to	1
fill	1
my	1
next	1
fold	1
of	1
the	1
future.	1
Listener	1
up	1
there!	1
what	1
have	1
you	1
to	1
confide	1
to	1
me?	1
Look	1
in	1
my	1
face	1
while	1
I	1
snuff	1
the	1
sidle	1
of	1
evening,	1
(Talk	1
honestly,	1
no	1
one	1
else	1
hears	1
you,	1
and	1
I	1
stay	1
only	1
a	1
minute	1
longer.)	1
Do	1
I	1
contradict	1
myself?	1
Very	1
well	1
then	1
I	1
contradict	1
myself,	1
(I	1
am	1
large,	1
I	1
contain	1
multitudes.)	1
I	1
concentrate	1
toward	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
nigh,	1
I	1
wait	1
on	1
the	1
door-slab.	1
Who	1
has	1
done	1
his	1
day's	1
work?	1
who	1
will	1
soonest	1
be	1
through	1
with	1
his	1
supper?	1
Who	1
wishes	1
to	1
walk	1
with	1
me?	1
Will	1
you	1
speak	1
before	1
I	1
am	1
gone?	1
will	1
you	1
prove	1
already	1
too	1
late?	1
52	1
The	1
spotted	1
hawk	1
swoops	1
by	1
and	1
accuses	1
me,	1
he	1
complains	1
of	1
my	1
gab	1
and	1
my	1
loitering.	1
I	1
too	1
am	1
not	1
a	1
bit	1
tamed,	1
I	1
too	1
am	1
untranslatable,	1
I	1
sound	1
my	1
barbaric	1
yawp	1
over	1
the	1
roofs	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
The	1
last	1
scud	1
of	1
day	1
holds	1
back	1
for	1
me,	1
It	1
flings	1
my	1
likeness	1
after	1
the	1
rest	1
and	1
true	1
as	1
any	1
on	1
the	1
shadow'd	1
wilds,	1
It	1
coaxes	1
me	1
to	1
the	1
vapor	1
and	1
the	1
dusk.	1
I	1
depart	1
as	1
air,	1
I	1
shake	1
my	1
white	1
locks	1
at	1
the	1
runaway	1
sun,	1
I	1
effuse	1
my	1
flesh	1
in	1
eddies,	1
and	1
drift	1
it	1
in	1
lacy	1
jags.	1
I	1
bequeath	1
myself	1
to	1
the	1
dirt	1
to	1
grow	1
from	1
the	1
grass	1
I	1
love,	1
If	1
you	1
want	1
me	1
again	1
look	1
for	1
me	1
under	1
your	1
boot-soles.	1
You	1
will	1
hardly	1
know	1
who	1
I	1
am	1
or	1
what	1
I	1
mean,	1
But	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
good	1
health	1
to	1
you	1
nevertheless,	1
And	1
filter	1
and	1
fibre	1
your	1
blood.	1
Failing	1
to	1
fetch	1
me	1
at	1
first	1
keep	1
encouraged,	1
Missing	1
me	1
one	1
place	1
search	1
another,	1
I	1
stop	1
somewhere	1
waiting	1
for	1
you.	1

sing	1
the	1
body	1
electric,	1
The	1
armies	1
of	1
those	1
I	1

me	1

I	1
engirth	1
them,	1

charge	1
them	1
full	1

Was	1
it	1
doubted	1
that	1
those	1

the	1

fully	1
as	1
much	1

of	1
the	1

is	1

the	1

But	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
a	1
well-made	1
man	1
appears	1
not	1
only	1
in	1
his	1
face,	1
It	1
is	1
in	1
his	1
limbs	1

joints	1
also,	1
it	1
is	1
curiously	1
in	1
the	1
joints	1
of	1
his	1
hips	1
and	1
wrists,	1
It	1
is	1
in	1
his	1
walk,	1
the	1
carriage	1
of	1
his	1
neck,	1
the	1
flex	1
of	1
his	1
waist	1

knees,	1
dress	1
does	1
not	1
hide	1
him,	1
The	1
strong	1
sweet	1
quality	1
he	1
has	1
strikes	1
through	1
the	1
cotton	1

broadcloth,	1
To	1
see	1
him	1
pass	1
conveys	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
the	1
best	1
poem,	1
perhaps	1
more,	1
You	1
linger	1
to	1
see	1
his	1
back,	1
and	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
his	1
neck	1
and	1
shoulder-side.	1
The	1
sprawl	1
and	1
fulness	1
of	1
babes,	1
the	1
bosoms	1
and	1
heads	1
of	1
women,	1
the	1
folds	1
of	1
their	1
dress,	1
their	1
style	1
as	1
we	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1

the	1

their	1

The	1
swimmer	1
naked	1

the	1

as	1
he	1

through	1
the	1
transparent	1
green-shine,	1
or	1
lies	1
with	1
his	1
face	1
up	1
and	1
rolls	1
silently	1
to	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
heave	1
of	1
the	1
water,	1
The	1
bending	1
forward	1

backward	1
of	1
rowers	1
in	1
row-boats,	1
the	1
horse-man	1

his	1
saddle,	1
Girls,	1
mothers,	1
house-keepers,	1

all	1
their	1
performances,	1
The	1
group	1
of	1
laborers	1
seated	1
at	1
noon-time	1
with	1
their	1
open	1
dinner-kettles,	1
and	1

The	1

the	1
farmer's	1

hosing	1

the	1
sleigh-driver	1
driving	1
his	1
six	1

good-natured,	1
native-born,	1
out	1

the	1

The	1

the	1

The	1
upper-hold	1

the	1
hair	1

over	1

blinding	1
the	1
eyes;	1
The	1
march	1
of	1
firemen	1

their	1

the	1
play	1
of	1
masculine	1
muscle	1
through	1
clean-setting	1
trowsers	1

waist-straps,	1
The	1
slow	1

from	1
the	1

the	1
pause	1
when	1
the	1
bell	1
strikes	1
suddenly	1
again,	1
and	1
the	1
listening	1
on	1

The	1
natural,	1
perfect,	1
varied	1
attitudes,	1
the	1
bent	1
head,	1
the	1
curv'd	1
neck	1

the	1
counting;	1
Such-like	1
I	1
love--I	1
loosen	1
myself,	1
pass	1
freely,	1
am	1
at	1
the	1

pause,	1

I	1
knew	1
a	1
man,	1
a	1
common	1
farmer,	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
five	1
sons,	1
And	1
in	1
them	1
the	1
fathers	1
of	1
sons,	1
and	1
in	1
them	1
the	1
fathers	1
of	1
sons.	1
This	1
man	1
was	1
a	1
wonderful	1
vigor,	1
calmness,	1
beauty	1
of	1
person,	1
The	1
shape	1
of	1
his	1
head,	1
the	1
pale	1
yellow	1
and	1
white	1
of	1
his	1
hair	1
and	1
beard,	1
the	1
immeasurable	1
meaning	1
of	1
his	1
black	1
eyes,	1
the	1
richness	1
and	1
breadth	1
of	1
his	1
manners,	1
These	1
I	1
used	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
visit	1
him	1
to	1
see,	1
he	1
was	1
wise	1
also,	1
He	1
was	1
six	1
feet	1
tall,	1
he	1
was	1
over	1
eighty	1
years	1
old,	1
his	1
sons	1
were	1
massive,	1
clean,	1
bearded,	1
tan-faced,	1
handsome,	1
They	1
and	1
his	1
daughters	1
loved	1
him,	1
all	1
who	1
saw	1
him	1
loved	1
him,	1
They	1
did	1
not	1
love	1
him	1
by	1
allowance,	1
they	1
loved	1
him	1
with	1
personal	1
love,	1
He	1
drank	1
water	1
only,	1
the	1
blood	1
show'd	1
like	1
scarlet	1
through	1
the	1
clear-brown	1
skin	1
of	1
his	1
face,	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
frequent	1
gunner	1
and	1
fisher,	1
he	1
sail'd	1
his	1
boat	1
himself,	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
fine	1
one	1
presented	1
to	1
him	1
by	1
a	1
ship-joiner,	1
he	1
had	1
fowling-pieces	1
presented	1
to	1
him	1
by	1
men	1
that	1
loved	1
him,	1
When	1
he	1
went	1
with	1
his	1
five	1
sons	1
and	1
many	1
grand-sons	1
to	1
hunt	1
or	1
fish,	1
you	1
would	1
pick	1
him	1
out	1
as	1
the	1
most	1
beautiful	1
and	1
vigorous	1
of	1
the	1
gang,	1
You	1
would	1
wish	1
long	1
and	1
long	1
to	1
be	1
with	1
him,	1
you	1
would	1
wish	1
to	1
sit	1
by	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
boat	1
that	1
you	1
and	1
he	1
might	1
touch	1
each	1
other.	1
4	1
I	1
have	1
perceiv'd	1
that	1
to	1
be	1
with	1
those	1
I	1
like	1
is	1
enough,	1
To	1
stop	1
in	1
company	1
with	1
the	1
rest	1
at	1
evening	1
is	1
enough,	1
To	1
be	1
surrounded	1
by	1
beautiful,	1
curious,	1
breathing,	1
laughing	1
flesh	1
is	1
enough,	1
To	1
pass	1
among	1
them	1
or	1
touch	1
any	1
one,	1
or	1
rest	1
my	1
arm	1
ever	1
so	1
lightly	1
round	1
his	1
or	1
her	1
neck	1
for	1
a	1
moment,	1
what	1
is	1
this	1
then?	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
ask	1
any	1
more	1
delight,	1
I	1
swim	1
in	1
it	1
as	1
in	1
a	1
sea.	1
There	1
is	1
something	1
in	1
staying	1
close	1
to	1
men	1
and	1
women	1
and	1
looking	1
on	1
them,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
contact	1
and	1
odor	1
of	1
them,	1
that	1
pleases	1
the	1
soul	1
well,	1
All	1
things	1
please	1
the	1
soul,	1
but	1
these	1
please	1
the	1
soul	1
well.	1

This	1
is	1
the	1
female	1
form,	1
A	1
divine	1
nimbus	1
exhales	1
from	1
it	1
from	1
head	1
to	1
foot,	1
It	1
attracts	1
with	1
fierce	1
undeniable	1
attraction,	1
I	1
am	1
drawn	1
by	1
its	1
breath	1
as	1
if	1
I	1
were	1
no	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
helpless	1
vapor,	1
all	1
falls	1
aside	1
but	1
myself	1
and	1
it,	1
Books,	1
art,	1
religion,	1
time,	1
the	1
visible	1
and	1
solid	1
earth,	1
and	1
what	1
was	1
expected	1
of	1
heaven	1
or	1
fear'd	1
of	1
hell,	1
are	1
now	1
consumed,	1
Mad	1
filaments,	1
ungovernable	1
shoots	1
play	1
out	1
of	1
it,	1
the	1
response	1
likewise	1
ungovernable,	1
Hair,	1
bosom,	1
hips,	1
bend	1
of	1

The	1

No	1

Do	1

Within	1

is	1
sacred,	1

the	1

Their	1
flesh	1
has	1
the	1

They	1

ride,	1
wrestle,	1
shoot,	1
run,	1
strike,	1
retreat,	1

The	1
way	1
is	1

the	1

destructive,	1
You	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
give	1
up	1
all	1
else,	1
I	1
alone	1
would	1
expect	1
to	1
be	1
your	1
sole	1
and	1
exclusive	1
standard,	1
Your	1
novitiate	1
would	1
even	1
then	1
be	1
long	1
and	1
exhausting,	1
The	1
whole	1
past	1
theory	1
of	1
your	1
life	1
and	1
all	1
conformity	1
to	1
the	1

to	1

heard	1
at	1
the	1
close	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
how	1
my	1
name	1
had	1
been	1
receiv'd	1
with	1
plaudits	1
in	1
the	1
capitol,	1
still	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
happy	1
night	1
for	1
me	1
that	1
follow'd,	1
And	1
else	1
when	1
I	1
carous'd,	1
or	1
when	1
my	1
plans	1
were	1
accomplish'd,	1
still	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
happy,	1
But	1
the	1
day	1
when	1
I	1
rose	1
at	1
dawn	1
from	1
the	1
bed	1
of	1
perfect	1
health,	1
refresh'd,	1
singing,	1
inhaling	1
the	1
ripe	1
breath	1
of	1
autumn,	1
When	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
full	1
moon	1
in	1
the	1
west	1
grow	1
pale	1
and	1
disappear	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
light,	1
When	1
I	1
wander'd	1
alone	1
over	1
the	1
beach,	1
and	1
undressing	1
bathed,	1
laughing	1
with	1
the	1
cool	1
waters,	1
and	1
saw	1
the	1
sun	1
rise,	1
And	1
when	1
I	1
thought	1
how	1
my	1
dear	1
friend	1
my	1
lover	1
was	1
on	1
his	1
way	1
coming,	1
O	1
then	1
I	1
was	1
happy,	1
O	1
then	1
each	1
breath	1
tasted	1
sweeter,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
day	1
my	1
food	1
nourish'd	1
me	1
more,	1
and	1
the	1
beautiful	1
day	1
pass'd	1
well,	1
And	1
the	1
next	1
came	1
with	1
equal	1
joy,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
next	1
at	1
evening	1
came	1
my	1
friend,	1
And	1
that	1
night	1
while	1
all	1
was	1
still	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
waters	1
roll	1
slowly	1
continually	1
up	1
the	1
shores,	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
hissing	1
rustle	1
of	1
the	1
liquid	1
and	1
sands	1
as	1
directed	1
to	1
me	1
whispering	1
to	1
congratulate	1
me,	1
For	1
the	1
one	1
I	1
love	1
most	1
lay	1
sleeping	1
by	1
me	1
under	1
the	1
same	1
cover	1
in	1
the	1
cool	1
night,	1
In	1
the	1
stillness	1
in	1
the	1
autumn	1
moonbeams	1
his	1
face	1
was	1
inclined	1
toward	1
me,	1
And	1
his	1
arm	1
lay	1
lightly	1
around	1
my	1
breast--and	1
that	1
night	1
I	1
was	1
happy.	1

Louisiana	1
a	1
live-oak	1
growing,	1
All	1
alone	1

hung	1
down	1
from	1

Without	1
any	1

grew	1
there	1
uttering	1
joyous	1
of	1
dark	1

And	1
its	1
look,	1
rude,	1
unbending,	1
lusty,	1
made	1
me	1

myself,	1

alone	1
there	1
without	1

friend	1
near,	1
for	1

knew	1
I	1

not,	1

I	1
broke	1
off	1
a	1
twig	1
with	1
a	1

number	1
of	1

upon	1
it	1

twined	1
around	1

brought	1
it	1
away,	1

The	1

The	1

Henceforth	1
I	1

good-fortune,	1
I	1
myself	1
am	1
good-fortune,	1
Henceforth	1
I	1
whimper	1
no	1

no	1

nothing,	1
Done	1
with	1

querulous	1
criticisms,	1
Strong	1
and	1
content	1
I	1
travel	1
the	1

The	1
earth,	1
that	1
is	1

not	1

the	1

Here	1
the	1

lesson	1
of	1

The	1

worn	1
in	1

irregular	1
hollows	1

I	1
believe	1
you	1
are	1
latent	1
with	1
unseen	1
existences,	1
you	1
are	1
so	1

all	1

impart	1
the	1

secretly	1

From	1
the	1

the	1
dead	1
you	1
have	1
peopled	1
your	1
impassive	1

thereof	1

be	1
evident	1

Do	1
not	1

Do	1
you	1
say	1
Venture	1
not--if	1
you	1
leave	1

you	1
are	1
lost?	1
Do	1
you	1
say	1
I	1
am	1
already	1
prepared,	1
I	1
am	1
well-beaten	1
and	1
undenied,	1
adhere	1
to	1

O	1

I	1

back	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
afraid	1
to	1
leave	1
you,	1
yet	1
I	1
love	1
you,	1
You	1
express	1
me	1
better	1
than	1
I	1
can	1
express	1
myself,	1
You	1
shall	1
be	1
more	1
to	1
me	1
than	1
my	1
poem.	1
I	1
think	1
heroic	1
deeds	1
were	1
all	1
conceiv'd	1
in	1
the	1
open	1
air,	1
and	1
all	1
free	1
poems	1

I	1

I	1
could	1
stop	1
here	1
myself	1
and	1
do	1
miracles,	1
I	1
think	1
whatever	1
I	1
shall	1
meet	1
on	1
the	1
road	1
I	1
shall	1
like,	1
and	1
whoever	1
beholds	1
me	1
shall	1
like	1
me,	1
I	1
think	1
whoever	1
I	1
see	1
must	1
be	1
happy.	1
5	1
From	1
this	1
hour	1
I	1
ordain	1
myself	1
loos'd	1
of	1
limits	1
and	1
imaginary	1
lines,	1
Going	1
where	1
I	1
list,	1
my	1
own	1
master	1
total	1
and	1
absolute,	1
Listening	1
to	1
others,	1
considering	1
well	1
what	1
they	1
say,	1
Pausing,	1
searching,	1
receiving,	1
contemplating,	1
Gently,	1
but	1
with	1
undeniable	1
will,	1
divesting	1
myself	1
of	1
the	1
holds	1
that	1
would	1
hold	1
me.	1
I	1
inhale	1
great	1
draughts	1
of	1
space,	1
The	1
east	1
and	1
the	1
west	1
are	1
mine,	1
and	1
the	1
north	1
and	1
the	1
south	1
are	1
mine.	1
I	1
am	1
larger,	1
better	1
than	1
I	1
thought,	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
I	1
held	1
so	1
much	1
goodness.	1
All	1
seems	1
beautiful	1
to	1
me,	1
can	1
repeat	1
over	1
to	1
men	1
and	1
women	1
You	1
have	1
done	1
such	1
good	1
to	1
me	1
I	1
would	1
do	1
the	1
same	1
to	1
you,	1
I	1
will	1
recruit	1
for	1
myself	1
and	1
you	1
as	1
I	1
go,	1
I	1
will	1
scatter	1
myself	1
among	1
men	1
and	1
women	1
as	1
I	1
go,	1
I	1
will	1
toss	1
a	1
new	1
gladness	1
and	1
roughness	1
among	1
them,	1
Whoever	1
denies	1
me	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
trouble	1
me,	1
Whoever	1
accepts	1
me	1
he	1
or	1
she	1
shall	1
be	1
blessed	1
and	1
shall	1
bless	1
me.	1
6	1
Now	1
if	1
a	1
thousand	1
perfect	1
men	1
were	1
to	1
appear	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
amaze	1
me,	1
Now	1
if	1
a	1
thousand	1
beautiful	1
forms	1
of	1
women	1
appear'd	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
astonish	1
me.	1
Now	1
I	1
see	1
the	1
secret	1
of	1
the	1
making	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
persons,	1
It	1
is	1
to	1
grow	1
in	1
the	1
open	1
air	1
and	1
to	1
eat	1
and	1
sleep	1
with	1
the	1
earth.	1
Here	1
a	1
great	1
personal	1
deed	1
has	1
room,	1
(Such	1
a	1
deed	1
seizes	1
upon	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
race	1
of	1
men,	1
Its	1
effusion	1
of	1
strength	1
and	1
will	1
overwhelms	1
law	1
and	1
mocks	1
all	1
authority	1
and	1
all	1
argument	1
against	1
it.)	1
Here	1
is	1
the	1
test	1
of	1
wisdom,	1
Wisdom	1
is	1
not	1
finally	1
tested	1
in	1
schools,	1
Wisdom	1
cannot	1
be	1
pass'd	1
from	1
one	1
having	1
it	1
to	1
another	1
not	1
having	1
it,	1
Wisdom	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
soul,	1
is	1
not	1
susceptible	1
of	1
proof,	1
is	1
its	1
own	1
proof,	1
Applies	1
to	1
all	1
stages	1
and	1
objects	1
and	1
qualities	1
and	1
is	1
content,	1
Is	1
the	1
certainty	1
of	1
the	1
reality	1
and	1
immortality	1
of	1
things,	1
and	1
the	1
excellence	1
of	1
things;	1
Something	1
there	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
float	1
of	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
things	1
that	1
provokes	1
it	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
soul.	1
Now	1
I	1
re-examine	1
philosophies	1
and	1
religions,	1
They	1
may	1
prove	1
well	1
in	1
lecture-rooms,	1
yet	1
not	1
prove	1
at	1
all	1
under	1
the	1
spacious	1
clouds	1
and	1
along	1
the	1
landscape	1
and	1
flowing	1
currents.	1
Here	1
is	1
realization,	1
Here	1
is	1
a	1
man	1
tallied--he	1
realizes	1
here	1
what	1
he	1
has	1
in	1
him,	1
The	1
past,	1
the	1
future,	1
majesty,	1
love--if	1
they	1
are	1
vacant	1
of	1
you,	1
you	1
are	1
vacant	1
of	1
them.	1
Only	1
the	1
kernel	1
of	1
every	1
object	1
nourishes;	1
Where	1
is	1
he	1
who	1
tears	1
off	1
the	1
husks	1
for	1
you	1
and	1
me?	1
Where	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
undoes	1
stratagems	1
and	1
envelopes	1
for	1
you	1
and	1
me?	1
Here	1
is	1
adhesiveness,	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
previously	1
fashion'd,	1
it	1
is	1
apropos;	1
Do	1
you	1
know	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
as	1
you	1
pass	1
to	1
be	1
loved	1
by	1
strangers?	1
Do	1
you	1
know	1
the	1
talk	1
of	1
those	1
turning	1
eye-balls?	1
7	1
Here	1
is	1
the	1
efflux	1
of	1
the	1
soul,	1
The	1
efflux	1
of	1
the	1
soul	1
comes	1
from	1
within	1
through	1
embower'd	1
gates,	1
ever	1
provoking	1
questions,	1
These	1
yearnings	1
why	1
are	1
they?	1
these	1
thoughts	1
in	1
the	1
darkness	1
why	1
are	1
they?	1
Why	1
are	1
there	1
men	1
and	1
women	1
that	1
while	1
they	1
are	1
nigh	1
me	1
the	1
sunlight	1
expands	1
my	1
blood?	1
Why	1
when	1
they	1
leave	1
me	1
do	1
my	1
pennants	1
of	1
joy	1
sink	1
flat	1
and	1
lank?	1
Why	1
are	1
there	1
trees	1
I	1
never	1
walk	1
under	1
but	1
large	1
and	1
melodious	1
thoughts	1
descend	1
upon	1
me?	1
(I	1
think	1
they	1
hang	1
there	1
winter	1
and	1
summer	1
on	1
those	1
trees	1
and	1
always	1
drop	1
fruit	1
as	1
I	1
pass;)	1
What	1
is	1
it	1
I	1
interchange	1
so	1
suddenly	1
with	1
strangers?	1
What	1
with	1
some	1
driver	1
as	1
I	1
ride	1
on	1
the	1
seat	1
by	1
his	1
side?	1
What	1
with	1
some	1
fisherman	1
drawing	1
his	1
seine	1
by	1
the	1
shore	1
as	1
I	1
walk	1
by	1
and	1
pause?	1
What	1
gives	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
free	1
to	1
a	1
woman's	1
and	1
man's	1
good-will?	1
what	1
gives	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
free	1
to	1
mine?	1
8	1
The	1
efflux	1
of	1
the	1
soul	1
is	1
happiness,	1
here	1
is	1
happiness,	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
pervades	1
the	1
open	1
air,	1
waiting	1
at	1
all	1
times,	1
Now	1
it	1
flows	1
unto	1
us,	1
we	1
are	1
rightly	1
charged.	1
Here	1
rises	1
the	1
fluid	1
and	1
attaching	1
character,	1
The	1
fluid	1
and	1
attaching	1
character	1
is	1
the	1
freshness	1
and	1
sweetness	1
of	1
man	1
and	1
woman,	1
(The	1
herbs	1
of	1
the	1
morning	1
sprout	1
no	1
fresher	1
and	1
sweeter	1
every	1
day	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
roots	1
of	1
themselves,	1
than	1
it	1
sprouts	1
fresh	1
and	1
sweet	1
continually	1
out	1
of	1
itself.)	1
Toward	1
the	1
fluid	1
and	1
attaching	1
character	1
exudes	1
the	1
sweat	1
of	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
young	1
and	1
old,	1
From	1
it	1
falls	1
distill'd	1
the	1
charm	1
that	1
mocks	1
beauty	1
and	1
attainments,	1
Toward	1
it	1
heaves	1
the	1
shuddering	1
longing	1
ache	1
of	1
contact.	1

Allons!	1
whoever	1
you	1
are	1
come	1
travel	1
with	1
me!	1
Traveling	1
with	1
me	1
you	1
find	1
what	1
never	1
tires.	1
The	1
earth	1
never	1
tires,	1
The	1
earth	1
is	1
rude,	1
silent,	1
incomprehensible	1
at	1
first,	1
Nature	1
is	1
rude	1
and	1
incomprehensible	1
at	1
first,	1
Be	1
not	1
discouraged,	1
keep	1
on,	1
there	1
are	1
divine	1
things	1
well	1
envelop'd,	1
I	1
swear	1
to	1
you	1
there	1
are	1
divine	1
things	1
more	1
beautiful	1
than	1
words	1
can	1
tell.	1
Allons!	1
we	1
must	1
not	1
stop	1
here,	1
However	1
sweet	1
these	1
laid-up	1
stores,	1
however	1
convenient	1
this	1
dwelling	1
we	1
cannot	1
remain	1
here,	1
However	1
shelter'd	1
this	1
port	1
and	1
however	1
calm	1
these	1
waters	1
we	1
must	1
not	1
anchor	1
here,	1
However	1
welcome	1
the	1
hospitality	1
that	1
surrounds	1
us	1
we	1
are	1
permitted	1
to	1
receive	1
it	1
but	1
a	1
little	1
while.	1
10	1
Allons!	1
the	1
inducements	1
shall	1
be	1
greater,	1
We	1
will	1
sail	1
pathless	1
and	1
wild	1
seas,	1
We	1
will	1
go	1
where	1
winds	1
blow,	1
waves	1
dash,	1
and	1
the	1
Yankee	1
clipper	1
speeds	1
by	1
under	1
full	1
sail.	1
Allons!	1
with	1
power,	1
liberty,	1
the	1
earth,	1
the	1
elements,	1
Health,	1
defiance,	1
gayety,	1
self-esteem,	1
curiosity;	1
Allons!	1
from	1
all	1
formules!	1
From	1
your	1
formules,	1
O	1
bat-eyed	1
and	1
materialistic	1
priests.	1
The	1
stale	1
cadaver	1
blocks	1
up	1
the	1
passage--the	1
burial	1
waits	1
no	1
longer.	1
Allons!	1
yet	1
take	1
warning!	1
He	1
traveling	1
with	1
me	1
needs	1
the	1
best	1
blood,	1
thews,	1
endurance,	1
None	1
may	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
trial	1
till	1
he	1
or	1
she	1
bring	1
courage	1
and	1
health,	1
Come	1
not	1
here	1
if	1
you	1
have	1
already	1
spent	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
yourself,	1
Only	1
those	1
may	1
come	1
who	1
come	1
in	1
sweet	1
and	1
determin'd	1
bodies,	1
No	1
diseas'd	1
person,	1
no	1
rum-drinker	1
or	1
venereal	1
taint	1
is	1
permitted	1
here.	1
(I	1
and	1
mine	1
do	1
not	1
convince	1
by	1
arguments,	1
similes,	1
rhymes,	1
We	1
convince	1
by	1
our	1
presence.)	1
11	1
Listen!	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
honest	1
with	1
you,	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
offer	1
the	1
old	1
smooth	1
prizes,	1
but	1
offer	1
rough	1
new	1
prizes,	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
days	1
that	1
must	1
happen	1
to	1
you:	1
You	1
shall	1
not	1
heap	1
up	1
what	1
is	1
call'd	1
riches,	1
You	1
shall	1
scatter	1
with	1
lavish	1
hand	1
all	1
that	1
you	1
earn	1
or	1
achieve,	1
You	1
but	1
arrive	1
at	1
the	1
city	1
to	1
which	1
you	1
were	1
destin'd,	1
you	1
hardly	1
settle	1
yourself	1
to	1
satisfaction	1
before	1
you	1
are	1
call'd	1
by	1
an	1
irresistible	1
call	1
to	1
depart,	1
You	1
shall	1
be	1
treated	1
to	1
the	1
ironical	1
smiles	1
and	1
mockings	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
remain	1
behind	1
you,	1
What	1
beckonings	1
of	1
love	1
you	1
receive	1
you	1
shall	1
only	1
answer	1
with	1
passionate	1
kisses	1
of	1
parting,	1
You	1
shall	1
not	1
allow	1
the	1
hold	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
spread	1
their	1
reach'd	1
hands	1
toward	1
you.	1
12	1
Allons!	1
after	1
the	1
great	1
Companions,	1
and	1
to	1
belong	1

them!	1
They	1
too	1
are	1
on	1

are	1
the	1
swift	1

majestic	1
men--they	1
are	1

Enjoyers	1
of	1

13	1
Allons!	1
to	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
endless	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
beginningless,	1
To	1
undergo	1
much,	1
tramps	1
of	1
days,	1
rests	1
of	1
nights,	1
To	1
merge	1
all	1
in	1
the	1
travel	1
they	1
tend	1
to,	1
and	1
the	1
days	1
and	1
nights	1
they	1
tend	1
to,	1
Again	1
to	1
merge	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
start	1
of	1
superior	1
journeys,	1
To	1
see	1
nothing	1
anywhere	1
but	1
what	1
you	1
may	1
reach	1
it	1
and	1
pass	1
it,	1
To	1
conceive	1
no	1
time,	1
however	1
distant,	1
but	1
what	1
you	1
may	1
reach	1
it	1
and	1
pass	1
it,	1
To	1
look	1
up	1
or	1
down	1
no	1
road	1
but	1
it	1
stretches	1
and	1
waits	1
for	1
you,	1
however	1
long	1
but	1
it	1
stretches	1
and	1
waits	1
for	1
you,	1
To	1
see	1
no	1
being,	1
not	1
God's	1
or	1
any,	1
but	1
you	1
also	1
go	1
thither,	1
To	1
see	1
no	1
possession	1
but	1
you	1
may	1
possess	1
it,	1
enjoying	1
all	1
without	1
labor	1
or	1
purchase,	1
abstracting	1
the	1
feast	1
yet	1
not	1
abstracting	1
one	1
particle	1
of	1
it,	1
To	1
take	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
the	1
farmer's	1
farm	1
and	1
the	1
rich	1
man's	1
elegant	1
villa,	1
and	1
the	1

of	1
the	1
well-married	1
couple,	1
and	1
the	1
fruits	1
of	1
orchards	1

To	1
take	1
to	1
your	1
use	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
compact	1
cities	1
as	1
you	1
pass	1
through,	1
To	1
carry	1
buildings	1
and	1
streets	1
with	1
you	1
afterward	1
wherever	1
you	1
go,	1
To	1
gather	1
the	1
minds	1
of	1
men	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
brains	1
as	1
you	1
encounter	1
them,	1
to	1
gather	1
the	1
love	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
hearts,	1
To	1
take	1
your	1
lovers	1
on	1
the	1

To	1

the	1
universe	1
itself	1
as	1
a	1
road,	1
as	1
many	1
roads,	1
as	1
roads	1

All	1

the	1

of	1

All	1

all	1

that	1
was	1

apparent	1
upon	1
this	1

Of	1

Forever	1

forever	1

Stately,	1

Desperate,	1

They	1

they	1
go!	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
they	1
go,	1
but	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
where	1
they	1
go,	1
But	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
they	1
go	1
toward	1
the	1
best--toward	1
something	1
great.	1
Whoever	1
you	1
are,	1
come	1
forth!	1
or	1
man	1
or	1
woman	1
come	1
forth!	1
You	1
must	1
not	1
stay	1
sleeping	1
and	1
dallying	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
house,	1
though	1
you	1
built	1
it,	1
or	1
though	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
built	1
for	1
you.	1
Out	1
of	1
the	1
dark	1
confinement!	1
out	1
from	1
behind	1
the	1
screen!	1
It	1
is	1
useless	1
to	1
protest,	1
I	1
know	1
all	1
and	1
expose	1
it.	1
Behold	1
through	1
you	1
as	1
bad	1
as	1
the	1
rest,	1
Through	1
the	1
laughter,	1
dancing,	1
dining,	1
supping,	1
of	1
people,	1
Inside	1
of	1
dresses	1
and	1

inside	1
of	1
those	1
wash'd	1

trimm'd	1

Behold	1
a	1
secret	1
silent	1
loathing	1
and	1
despair.	1
No	1
husband,	1
no	1
wife,	1
no	1

trusted	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
confession,	1
Another	1
self,	1
a	1
duplicate	1
of	1
every	1
one,	1
skulking	1
and	1
hiding	1
it	1
goes,	1
Formless	1
and	1
wordless	1
through	1
the	1
streets	1
of	1
the	1

In	1

Home	1

of	1
men	1

women,	1
at	1
the	1

Smartly	1
attired,	1

Under	1

Keeping	1

The	1

Have	1

What	1

no	1

My	1

the	1

I	1
nourish	1
active	1

He	1
going	1
with	1
me	1

well	1
arm'd,	1
He	1
going	1

me	1
goes	1
often	1
with	1
spare	1

poverty,	1
angry	1
enemies,	1
desertions.	1

Allons!	1
the	1
road	1
is	1

us!	1
It	1
is	1
safe--I	1
have	1
tried	1
it--my	1

it	1
well--be	1

Camerado,	1
I	1

you	1
my	1
hand!	1
I	1
give	1
you	1
my	1
love	1
more	1
precious	1
than	1

I	1
give	1
you	1
myself	1

Will	1
you	1

will	1

On	1

the	1

The	1

sustenance	1
of	1
me	1
from	1
all	1

at	1
all	1

myself	1

every	1

The	1

The	1

on	1
the	1

The	1

swimming	1
with	1
me	1
far	1

The	1

to	1
follow	1
me,	1
the	1

The	1
certainty	1
of	1
others,	1
the	1
life,	1

of	1
others.	1
Others	1
will	1
enter	1
the	1

the	1

of	1
a	1
generation,	1
or	1
ever	1
so	1

Just	1
as	1
you	1
feel	1
when	1
you	1
look	1
on	1
the	1
river	1
and	1
sky,	1
so	1
I	1
felt,	1
Just	1
as	1
any	1
of	1
you	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
a	1
living	1
crowd,	1
I	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
a	1
crowd,	1
Just	1
as	1
you	1
are	1
refresh'd	1
by	1
the	1
gladness	1
of	1
the	1
river	1
and	1
the	1
bright	1
flow,	1
I	1
was	1
refresh'd,	1
Just	1
as	1
you	1
stand	1
and	1
lean	1
on	1
the	1
rail,	1
yet	1
hurry	1
with	1
the	1
swift	1
current,	1
I	1
stood	1
yet	1
was	1
hurried,	1
Just	1
as	1
you	1
look	1
on	1
the	1
numberless	1
masts	1
of	1
ships	1
and	1
the	1
thick-stemm'd	1
pipes	1
of	1
steamboats,	1
I	1
look'd.	1
I	1
too	1
many	1
and	1
many	1
a	1
time	1
cross'd	1
the	1
river	1
of	1
old,	1
Watched	1
the	1
Twelfth-month	1
sea-gulls,	1
saw	1
them	1
high	1
in	1
the	1
air	1
floating	1
with	1
motionless	1
wings,	1
oscillating	1
their	1
bodies,	1
Saw	1
how	1
the	1
glistening	1
yellow	1
lit	1
up	1
parts	1
of	1
their	1
bodies	1
and	1
left	1
the	1
rest	1
in	1
strong	1
shadow,	1
Saw	1
the	1
slow-wheeling	1
circles	1
and	1
the	1
gradual	1
edging	1
toward	1
the	1
south,	1
Saw	1
the	1
reflection	1
of	1
the	1
summer	1
sky	1
in	1
the	1
water,	1
Had	1
my	1
eyes	1
dazzled	1
by	1
the	1
shimmering	1
track	1
of	1
beams,	1
Look'd	1
at	1
the	1
fine	1
centrifugal	1
spokes	1
of	1
light	1
round	1
the	1
shape	1
of	1
my	1
head	1
in	1
the	1
sunlit	1
water,	1
Look'd	1
on	1
the	1
haze	1
on	1
the	1
hills	1
southward	1
and	1
south-westward,	1
Look'd	1
on	1
the	1
vapor	1
as	1
it	1
flew	1
in	1
fleeces	1
tinged	1
with	1
violet,	1
Look'd	1
toward	1
the	1
lower	1
bay	1
to	1
notice	1
the	1
vessels	1
arriving,	1
Saw	1
their	1
approach,	1
saw	1
aboard	1
those	1
that	1
were	1
near	1
me,	1
Saw	1
the	1
white	1
sails	1
of	1
schooners	1
and	1
sloops,	1
saw	1
the	1
ships	1
at	1
anchor,	1
The	1
sailors	1
at	1
work	1
in	1
the	1
rigging	1
or	1
out	1
astride	1
the	1
spars,	1
The	1
round	1
masts,	1
the	1
swinging	1
motion	1
of	1
the	1
hulls,	1
the	1
slender	1
serpentine	1
pennants,	1
The	1
large	1
and	1
small	1
steamers	1
in	1
motion,	1
the	1
pilots	1
in	1
their	1
pilothouses,	1
The	1
white	1
wake	1
left	1
by	1
the	1
passage,	1
the	1
quick	1
tremulous	1
whirl	1
of	1
the	1
wheels,	1
The	1
flags	1
of	1
all	1
nations,	1
the	1
falling	1
of	1
them	1
at	1
sunset,	1
The	1
scallop-edged	1
waves	1
in	1
the	1
twilight,	1
the	1
ladled	1
cups,	1
the	1
frolic-some	1
crests	1
and	1
glistening,	1
The	1
stretch	1
afar	1
growing	1
dimmer	1
and	1
dimmer,	1
the	1
gray	1
walls	1
of	1
the	1
granite	1
storehouses	1
by	1
the	1
docks,	1
On	1
the	1
river	1
the	1
shadowy	1
group,	1
the	1
big	1
steam-tug	1
closely	1
flank'd	1
on	1
each	1
side	1
by	1
the	1
barges,	1
the	1
hay-boat,	1
the	1
belated	1
lighter,	1
On	1
the	1
neighboring	1
shore	1
the	1
fires	1
from	1
the	1
foundry	1
chimneys	1
burning	1
high	1
and	1
glaringly	1
into	1
the	1
night,	1
Casting	1
their	1
flicker	1
of	1
black	1
contrasted	1
with	1
wild	1
red	1
and	1
yellow	1
light	1
over	1
the	1
tops	1
of	1
houses,	1
and	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
clefts	1
of	1
streets.	1
4	1
These	1
and	1
all	1
else	1
were	1
to	1
me	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
they	1
are	1
to	1
you,	1
I	1
loved	1
well	1
those	1
cities,	1
loved	1
well	1
the	1
stately	1
and	1
rapid	1
river,	1
The	1
men	1
and	1
women	1
I	1
saw	1
were	1
all	1
near	1
to	1
me,	1
Others	1
the	1
same--others	1
who	1
look	1
back	1
on	1
me	1
because	1
I	1
look'd	1
forward	1
to	1
them,	1
(The	1
time	1
will	1
come,	1
though	1
I	1
stop	1
here	1
to-day	1
and	1
to-night.)	1

What	1
is	1
it	1
then	1
between	1
us?	1
What	1
is	1
the	1
count	1
of	1
the	1
scores	1
or	1
hundreds	1
of	1
years	1
between	1
us?	1
Whatever	1
it	1
is,	1
it	1
avails	1
not--distance	1
avails	1
not,	1
and	1
place	1
avails	1
not,	1
I	1
too	1
lived,	1
Brooklyn	1
of	1
ample	1
hills	1
was	1
mine,	1
I	1
too	1
walk'd	1
the	1
streets	1
of	1
Manhattan	1
island,	1
and	1
bathed	1
in	1
the	1
waters	1
around	1
it,	1
I	1
too	1
felt	1
the	1
curious	1
abrupt	1
questionings	1
stir	1
within	1
me,	1
In	1
the	1
day	1
among	1
crowds	1
of	1
people	1
sometimes	1
they	1
came	1
upon	1
me,	1
In	1
my	1
walks	1
home	1
late	1
at	1
night	1
or	1
as	1
I	1
lay	1
in	1
my	1
bed	1
they	1
came	1
upon	1
me,	1
I	1
too	1
had	1
been	1
struck	1
from	1
the	1
float	1
forever	1
held	1
in	1
solution,	1
I	1
too	1
had	1
receiv'd	1
identity	1
by	1
my	1
body,	1
That	1
I	1
was	1
I	1
knew	1
was	1
of	1
my	1
body,	1
and	1
what	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
I	1
knew	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
of	1
my	1
body.	1
6	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
upon	1
you	1
alone	1
the	1
dark	1
patches	1
fall,	1
The	1
dark	1
threw	1
its	1
patches	1
down	1
upon	1
me	1
also,	1
The	1
best	1
I	1
had	1
done	1
seem'd	1
to	1
me	1
blank	1
and	1
suspicious,	1
My	1
great	1
thoughts	1
as	1
I	1
supposed	1
them,	1
were	1
they	1
not	1
in	1
reality	1
meagre?	1
Nor	1
is	1
it	1
you	1
alone	1
who	1
know	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
evil,	1
I	1
am	1
he	1
who	1
knew	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
evil,	1
I	1
too	1
knitted	1
the	1
old	1
knot	1
of	1
contrariety,	1
Blabb'd,	1
blush'd,	1
resented,	1
lied,	1
stole,	1
grudg'd,	1
Had	1
guile,	1
anger,	1
lust,	1
hot	1
wishes	1
I	1
dared	1
not	1
speak,	1
Was	1
wayward,	1
vain,	1
greedy,	1
shallow,	1
sly,	1
cowardly,	1
malignant,	1
The	1
wolf,	1
the	1
snake,	1
the	1
hog,	1
not	1
wanting	1
in	1
me.	1
The	1
cheating	1
look,	1
the	1
frivolous	1
word,	1
the	1
adulterous	1
wish,	1
not	1
wanting,	1
Refusals,	1
hates,	1
postponements,	1
meanness,	1
laziness,	1
none	1
of	1
these	1
wanting,	1
Was	1
one	1
with	1
the	1
rest,	1
the	1
days	1
and	1
haps	1
of	1
the	1
rest,	1
Was	1
call'd	1
by	1
my	1
nighest	1
name	1
by	1
clear	1
loud	1
voices	1
of	1
young	1
men	1
as	1
they	1
saw	1
me	1
approaching	1
or	1
passing,	1
Felt	1
their	1
arms	1
on	1
my	1
neck	1
as	1
I	1
stood,	1
or	1
the	1
negligent	1
leaning	1
of	1
their	1
flesh	1
against	1
me	1
as	1
I	1
sat,	1
Saw	1
many	1
I	1
loved	1
in	1
the	1
street	1
or	1
ferry-boat	1
or	1
public	1
assembly,	1
yet	1
never	1
told	1
them	1
a	1
word,	1
Lived	1
the	1
same	1
life	1
with	1
the	1
rest,	1
the	1
same	1
old	1
laughing,	1
gnawing,	1
sleeping,	1
Play'd	1
the	1
part	1
that	1
still	1
looks	1
back	1
on	1
the	1
actor	1
or	1
actress,	1
The	1
same	1
old	1
role,	1
the	1
role	1
that	1
is	1
what	1
we	1
make	1
it,	1
as	1
great	1
as	1
we	1
like,	1
Or	1
as	1
small	1
as	1
we	1
like,	1
or	1
both	1
great	1
and	1
small.	1
7	1
Closer	1
yet	1
I	1
approach	1
you,	1
What	1
thought	1
you	1
have	1
of	1
me	1
now,	1
I	1
had	1
as	1
much	1
of	1
you--I	1
laid	1
in	1
my	1
stores	1
in	1
advance,	1
I	1
consider'd	1
long	1
and	1
seriously	1
of	1
you	1
before	1
you	1
were	1
born.	1
Who	1
was	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
should	1
come	1
home	1
to	1
me?	1
Who	1
knows	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
enjoying	1
this?	1
Who	1
knows,	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
distance,	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
as	1
good	1
as	1
looking	1
at	1
you	1
now,	1
for	1
all	1
you	1
cannot	1
see	1
me?	1
8	1
Ah,	1
what	1
can	1
ever	1
be	1
more	1
stately	1
and	1
admirable	1
to	1
me	1
than	1
mast-hemm'd	1
Manhattan?	1
River	1
and	1
sunset	1
and	1
scallop-edg'd	1
waves	1
of	1
flood-tide?	1
The	1
sea-gulls	1
oscillating	1
their	1
bodies,	1
the	1
hay-boat	1
in	1
the	1
twilight,	1
and	1
the	1
belated	1
lighter?	1
What	1
gods	1
can	1
exceed	1
these	1
that	1
clasp	1
me	1
by	1
the	1
hand,	1
and	1
with	1
voices	1
I	1
love	1
call	1
me	1
promptly	1
and	1
loudly	1
by	1
my	1
nighest	1
name	1
as	1
approach?	1
What	1
is	1
more	1
subtle	1
than	1
this	1
which	1
ties	1
me	1
to	1
the	1
woman	1
or	1
man	1
that	1
looks	1
in	1
my	1
face?	1
Which	1
fuses	1
me	1
into	1
you	1
now,	1
and	1
pours	1
my	1
meaning	1
into	1
you?	1
We	1
understand	1
then	1
do	1
we	1
not?	1
What	1
I	1
promis'd	1
without	1
mentioning	1
it,	1
have	1
you	1
not	1
accepted?	1
What	1
the	1
study	1
could	1
not	1
teach--what	1
the	1
preaching	1
could	1
not	1
accomplish	1
is	1
accomplish'd,	1
is	1
it	1
not?	1

me	1

my	1

Live,	1
old	1

play	1
the	1
part	1
that	1
looks	1
back	1
on	1
the	1
actor	1

Play	1
the	1
old	1
role,	1
the	1
role	1
that	1
is	1
great	1
or	1
small	1
according	1
as	1
one	1
makes	1
it!	1
Consider,	1
you	1
who	1
peruse	1
me,	1
whether	1
I	1
may	1
not	1
in	1
unknown	1
ways	1
be	1
looking	1
upon	1
you;	1
Be	1
firm,	1
rail	1
over	1
the	1
river,	1
to	1
support	1
those	1
who	1
lean	1
idly,	1
yet	1
haste	1
with	1
the	1
hasting	1
current;	1
Fly	1
on,	1
sea-birds!	1
fly	1
sideways,	1
or	1
wheel	1
in	1
large	1
circles	1
high	1
in	1
the	1
air;	1
Receive	1
the	1

sky,	1
you	1

and	1
faithfully	1
hold	1
it	1
till	1
all	1
downcast	1
eyes	1
have	1
time	1
to	1
take	1
it	1
from	1
you!	1
Diverge,	1
fine	1

of	1
light,	1
from	1
the	1
shape	1
of	1
my	1
head,	1
or	1
any	1

in	1
the	1

Come	1

the	1

pass	1
up	1

white-sail'd	1

Flaunt	1
away,	1

at	1
sunset!	1
Burn	1

your	1

Appearances,	1

About	1

Expand,	1
being	1

which	1
none	1

Keep	1

You	1
have	1

you	1

wait,	1
you	1
dumb,	1
beautiful	1
ministers,	1
We	1

you	1

at	1

are	1
insatiate	1
henceforward,	1
Not	1

yourselves	1
from	1
us,	1
We	1
use	1
you,	1
and	1
do	1
not	1
cast	1
you	1
aside--we	1
plant	1
you	1
permanently	1
within	1
us,	1
We	1
fathom	1
you	1
not--we	1
love	1
you--there	1
is	1
perfection	1
in	1
you	1
also,	1
You	1

Great	1

Song	1
of	1
the	1
Answerer	1
1	1
Now	1
list	1
to	1
my	1
morning's	1
romanza,	1
I	1
tell	1
the	1
signs	1
of	1
the	1
Answerer,	1
To	1
the	1
cities	1
and	1
farms	1
I	1
sing	1
as	1
they	1
spread	1
in	1
the	1
sunshine	1
before	1
me.	1
A	1
young	1
man	1
comes	1
to	1
me	1
bearing	1
a	1
message	1
from	1
his	1
brother,	1
How	1
shall	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
know	1
the	1
whether	1
and	1
when	1
of	1
his	1
brother?	1
Tell	1
him	1
to	1
send	1
me	1
the	1
signs.	1
And	1
I	1
stand	1
before	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
face	1
to	1
face,	1
and	1
take	1
his	1
right	1
hand	1
in	1
my	1
left	1
hand	1
and	1
his	1
left	1
hand	1
in	1
my	1
right	1
hand,	1
And	1
I	1
answer	1
for	1
his	1
brother	1
and	1
for	1
men,	1
and	1
I	1
answer	1
for	1
him	1
that	1
answers	1
for	1
all,	1
and	1
send	1
these	1
signs.	1
Him	1
all	1
wait	1
for,	1
him	1
all	1
yield	1
up	1
to,	1
his	1
word	1
is	1
decisive	1
and	1
final,	1
Him	1
they	1
accept,	1
in	1
him	1
lave,	1
in	1
him	1
perceive	1
themselves	1
as	1
amid	1
light,	1
Him	1
they	1
immerse	1
and	1
he	1
immerses	1
them.	1
Beautiful	1
women,	1
the	1
haughtiest	1
nations,	1
laws,	1
the	1
landscape,	1
people,	1
animals,	1
The	1
profound	1
earth	1
and	1
its	1
attributes	1
and	1
the	1
unquiet	1
ocean,	1
(so	1
tell	1
I	1
my	1
morning's	1
romanza,)	1
All	1
enjoyments	1
and	1
properties	1
and	1
money,	1
and	1
whatever	1
money	1
will	1
buy,	1
The	1
best	1
farms,	1
others	1
toiling	1
and	1
planting	1
and	1
he	1
unavoidably	1
reaps,	1
The	1
noblest	1
and	1
costliest	1
cities,	1
others	1
grading	1
and	1
building	1
and	1
he	1
domiciles	1
there,	1
Nothing	1
for	1
any	1
one	1
but	1
what	1
is	1
for	1
him,	1
near	1
and	1
far	1
are	1
for	1
him,	1
the	1
ships	1
in	1
the	1
offing,	1
The	1
perpetual	1
shows	1
and	1
marches	1
on	1
land	1
are	1
for	1
him	1
if	1
they	1
are	1
for	1
anybody.	1
He	1
puts	1
things	1
in	1
their	1
attitudes,	1
He	1
puts	1
to-day	1
out	1
of	1
himself	1
with	1
plasticity	1
and	1
love,	1
He	1
places	1
his	1
own	1
times,	1
reminiscences,	1
parents,	1
brothers	1
and	1
sisters,	1
associations,	1
employment,	1
politics,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
rest	1
never	1
shame	1
them	1
afterward,	1
nor	1
assume	1
to	1
command	1
them.	1
He	1
is	1
the	1
Answerer,	1
What	1
can	1
be	1
answer'd	1
he	1
answers,	1
and	1
what	1
cannot	1
be	1
answer'd	1
he	1
shows	1
how	1
it	1
cannot	1
be	1
answer'd.	1
A	1
man	1
is	1
a	1
summons	1
and	1
challenge,	1
(It	1
is	1
vain	1
to	1
skulk--do	1
you	1
hear	1
that	1
mocking	1
and	1
laughter?	1
do	1
you	1
hear	1
the	1
ironical	1
echoes?)	1
Books,	1
friendships,	1
philosophers,	1
priests,	1
action,	1
pleasure,	1
pride,	1
beat	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
seeking	1
to	1
give	1
satisfaction,	1
He	1
indicates	1
the	1
satisfaction,	1
and	1
indicates	1
them	1
that	1
beat	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
also.	1
Whichever	1
the	1
sex,	1
whatever	1
the	1
season	1
or	1
place,	1
he	1
may	1
go	1
freshly	1
and	1
gently	1
and	1
safely	1
by	1
day	1
or	1
by	1
night,	1
He	1
has	1
the	1
pass-key	1
of	1
hearts,	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
response	1
of	1
the	1
prying	1
of	1
hands	1
on	1
the	1
knobs.	1
His	1
welcome	1
is	1
universal,	1
the	1
flow	1
of	1
beauty	1
is	1
not	1
more	1
welcome	1
or	1
universal	1
than	1
he	1
is,	1
The	1
person	1
he	1
favors	1
by	1
day	1
or	1
sleeps	1
with	1
at	1
night	1
is	1
blessed.	1
Every	1
existence	1
has	1
its	1
idiom,	1
every	1
thing	1
has	1
an	1
idiom	1
and	1
tongue,	1
He	1
resolves	1
all	1
tongues	1
into	1
his	1
own	1
and	1
bestows	1
it	1
upon	1
men,	1
and	1
any	1
man	1
translates,	1
and	1
any	1
man	1
translates	1
himself	1
also,	1
One	1
part	1
does	1
not	1
counteract	1
another	1
part,	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
joiner,	1
he	1
sees	1
how	1
they	1
join.	1
He	1
says	1
indifferently	1
and	1
alike	1
How	1
are	1
you	1
friend?	1
to	1
the	1
President	1
at	1
his	1
levee,	1
And	1
he	1
says	1
Good-day	1
my	1
brother,	1
to	1
Cudge	1
that	1
hoes	1
in	1
the	1
sugar-field,	1
And	1
both	1
understand	1
him	1
and	1
know	1
that	1
his	1
speech	1
is	1
right.	1
He	1
walks	1
with	1
perfect	1
ease	1
in	1
the	1
capitol,	1
He	1
walks	1
among	1
the	1
Congress,	1
and	1
one	1
Representative	1
says	1
to	1
another,	1
Here	1
is	1
our	1
equal	1
appearing	1
and	1
new.	1
Then	1
the	1
mechanics	1
take	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
mechanic,	1
And	1
the	1
soldiers	1
suppose	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
soldier,	1
and	1
the	1
sailors	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
follow'd	1
the	1
sea,	1
And	1
the	1
authors	1
take	1
him	1
for	1
an	1
author,	1
and	1
the	1
artists	1
for	1
an	1
artist,	1
And	1
the	1
laborers	1
perceive	1
he	1
could	1
labor	1
with	1
them	1
and	1
love	1
them,	1
No	1
matter	1
what	1
the	1
work	1
is,	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
one	1
to	1
follow	1
it	1
or	1
has	1
follow'd	1
it,	1
No	1
matter	1
what	1
the	1
nation,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
find	1
his	1
brothers	1
and	1
sisters	1
there.	1
The	1
English	1
believe	1
he	1
comes	1
of	1
their	1
English	1
stock,	1
A	1
Jew	1
to	1
the	1
Jew	1
he	1
seems,	1
a	1
Russ	1
to	1
the	1
Russ,	1
usual	1
and	1
near,	1
removed	1
from	1
none.	1
Whoever	1
he	1
looks	1
at	1
in	1
the	1
traveler's	1
coffee-house	1
claims	1
him,	1
The	1
Italian	1
or	1
Frenchman	1
is	1
sure,	1
the	1
German	1
is	1
sure,	1
the	1
Spaniard	1
is	1
sure,	1
and	1
the	1
island	1
Cuban	1
is	1
sure,	1
The	1
engineer,	1
the	1
deck-hand	1
on	1
the	1
great	1
lakes,	1
or	1
on	1
the	1
Mississippi	1
or	1
St.	1
Lawrence	1
or	1
Sacramento,	1
or	1
Hudson	1
or	1
Paumanok	1
sound,	1
claims	1
him.	1
The	1
gentleman	1
of	1
perfect	1
blood	1
acknowledges	1
his	1
perfect	1
blood,	1
The	1
insulter,	1
the	1
prostitute,	1
the	1
angry	1
person,	1
the	1
beggar,	1
see	1
themselves	1
in	1
the	1
ways	1
of	1
him,	1
he	1
strangely	1
transmutes	1
them,	1
They	1
are	1
not	1
vile	1
any	1
more,	1
they	1
hardly	1
know	1
themselves	1
they	1
are	1
so	1
grown.	1

Time,	1

without	1

itself	1
in	1

What	1
always	1
indicates	1
the	1
poet	1
is	1
the	1
crowd	1
of	1
the	1
pleasant	1
company	1
of	1
singers,	1
and	1
their	1
words,	1
The	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
singers	1
are	1
the	1
hours	1
or	1
minutes	1
of	1
the	1
light	1
or	1
dark,	1
but	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
maker	1
of	1
poems	1
are	1
the	1
general	1
light	1
and	1
dark,	1
The	1
maker	1
of	1
poems	1
settles	1
justice,	1
reality,	1
immortality,	1
His	1
insight	1
and	1
power	1
encircle	1
things	1
and	1
the	1
human	1

He	1
is	1
the	1
glory	1
and	1
extract	1
thus	1

of	1

and	1
of	1
the	1
human	1
race.	1
The	1
singers	1
do	1
not	1
beget,	1
only	1
the	1
Poet	1
begets,	1
The	1
singers	1
are	1
welcom'd,	1
understood,	1
appear	1
often	1
enough,	1
but	1
rare	1
has	1
the	1
day	1
been,	1
likewise	1
the	1
spot,	1
of	1
the	1
birth	1
of	1
the	1
maker	1
of	1
poems,	1
the	1
Answerer,	1
(Not	1
every	1
century	1
nor	1
every	1
five	1
centuries	1
has	1
contain'd	1
such	1
a	1
day,	1
for	1
all	1
its	1
names.)	1
The	1
singers	1
of	1
successive	1
hours	1
of	1
centuries	1
may	1
have	1
ostensible	1
names,	1
but	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
each	1
of	1
them	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
singers,	1
The	1
name	1
of	1
each	1
is,	1
eye-singer,	1
ear-singer,	1
head-singer,	1
sweet-singer,	1
night-singer,	1
parlor-singer,	1
love-singer,	1
weird-singer,	1
or	1
something	1
else.	1
All	1
this	1
time	1
and	1
at	1
all	1
times	1
wait	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
true	1
poems,	1
The	1
words	1
of	1
true	1
poems	1
do	1
not	1
merely	1
please,	1
The	1
true	1
poets	1
are	1
not	1
followers	1
of	1
beauty	1
but	1
the	1
august	1
masters	1
of	1
beauty;	1
The	1
greatness	1
of	1
sons	1
is	1
the	1
exuding	1
of	1
the	1
greatness	1
of	1
mothers	1
and	1
fathers,	1
The	1
words	1
of	1
true	1
poems	1
are	1
the	1
tuft	1
and	1
final	1
applause	1
of	1
science.	1
Divine	1
instinct,	1
breadth	1
of	1
vision,	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
reason,	1
health,	1
rudeness	1
of	1
body,	1
withdrawnness,	1
Gayety,	1
sun-tan,	1
air-sweetness,	1
such	1
are	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
poems.	1
The	1
sailor	1
and	1
traveler	1
underlie	1
the	1
maker	1
of	1
poems,	1
the	1
Answerer,	1
The	1
builder,	1
geometer,	1
chemist,	1
anatomist,	1
phrenologist,	1
artist,	1
all	1
these	1
underlie	1
the	1
maker	1
of	1
poems,	1
the	1
Answerer.	1
The	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
true	1
poems	1
give	1
you	1
more	1
than	1
poems,	1
They	1
give	1
you	1
to	1
form	1
for	1
yourself	1
poems,	1
religions,	1
politics,	1
war,	1
peace,	1
behavior,	1
histories,	1
essays,	1
daily	1
life,	1
and	1
every	1
thing	1
else,	1
They	1
balance	1
ranks,	1
colors,	1
races,	1
creeds,	1
and	1
the	1
sexes,	1
They	1
do	1
not	1
seek	1
beauty,	1
they	1
are	1
sought,	1
Forever	1
touching	1
them	1
or	1
close	1
upon	1
them	1
follows	1
beauty,	1
longing,	1
fain,	1
love-sick.	1
They	1
prepare	1
for	1
death,	1
yet	1
are	1
they	1
not	1
the	1
finish,	1
but	1
rather	1
the	1
outset,	1
They	1
bring	1
none	1
to	1
his	1
or	1
her	1
terminus	1
or	1
to	1
be	1
content	1
and	1
full,	1
Whom	1
they	1
take	1
they	1

To	1

The	1

futurity,	1
In	1

the	1

the	1

the	1

the	1

O	1
lands!	1
all	1
so	1
dear	1
to	1
me--what	1
you	1
are,	1
(whatever	1
it	1
is,)	1
I	1
putting	1
it	1
at	1
random	1
in	1
these	1
songs,	1
become	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
that,	1
whatever	1
it	1
is,	1
Southward	1
there,	1
I	1
screaming,	1
with	1
wings	1
slow	1
flapping,	1
with	1
the	1
myriads	1
of	1
gulls	1
wintering	1
along	1
the	1

of	1
Florida,	1

I	1
with	1
the	1
spring	1

laughing	1
and	1
skipping	1
and	1
running,	1
Northward,	1
on	1
the	1
sands,	1
on	1
some	1
shallow	1
bay	1
of	1
Paumanok,	1
I	1
with	1
parties	1
of	1
snowy	1
herons	1
wading	1
in	1
the	1
wet	1
to	1
seek	1
worms	1
and	1
aquatic	1

Retreating,	1
triumphantly	1
twittering,	1
the	1
king-bird,	1
from	1
piercing	1
the	1
crow	1
with	1
its	1
bill,	1
for	1
amusement--and	1
I	1
triumphantly	1
twittering,	1
The	1
migrating	1
flock	1
of	1
wild	1
geese	1
alighting	1
in	1
autumn	1
to	1

themselves,	1

I	1
feeding	1
and	1
taking	1
turns	1
with	1
the	1
rest,	1
In	1
Kanadian	1
forests	1
the	1
moose,	1
large	1
as	1
an	1
ox,	1
corner'd	1
by	1
hunters,	1
rising	1
desperately	1
on	1
his	1
hind-feet,	1
and	1
plunging	1
with	1

the	1

I,	1
plunging	1
at	1

corner'd	1

desperate,	1
In	1
the	1
Mannahatta,	1

I	1

A	1
Song	1
of	1
Joys	1
O	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
most	1
jubilant	1
song!	1
Full	1
of	1
music--full	1
of	1
manhood,	1
womanhood,	1
infancy!	1
Full	1
of	1
common	1
employments--full	1
of	1
grain	1
and	1
trees.	1
O	1
for	1
the	1
voices	1
of	1
animals--O	1
for	1
the	1
swiftness	1
and	1
balance	1
of	1
fishes!	1
O	1
for	1
the	1
dropping	1
of	1
raindrops	1
in	1
a	1
song!	1
O	1
for	1
the	1
sunshine	1
and	1
motion	1
of	1
waves	1
in	1
a	1
song!	1
O	1
the	1
joy	1
of	1
my	1
spirit--it	1
is	1
uncaged--it	1
darts	1
like	1
lightning!	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
enough	1
to	1
have	1
this	1
globe	1
or	1
a	1
certain	1
time,	1
I	1
will	1
have	1
thousands	1
of	1
globes	1
and	1
all	1
time.	1
O	1
the	1
engineer's	1
joys!	1
to	1
go	1
with	1
a	1
locomotive!	1
To	1
hear	1
the	1
hiss	1
of	1
steam,	1
the	1
merry	1
shriek,	1
the	1
steam-whistle,	1
the	1
laughing	1
locomotive!	1
To	1
push	1
with	1
resistless	1
way	1
and	1
speed	1
off	1
in	1
the	1
distance.	1
O	1
the	1
gleesome	1
saunter	1
over	1
fields	1
and	1
hillsides!	1
The	1
leaves	1
and	1
flowers	1
of	1
the	1
commonest	1
weeds,	1
the	1
moist	1
fresh	1
stillness	1
of	1
the	1
woods,	1
The	1
exquisite	1
smell	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
at	1
daybreak,	1
and	1
all	1
through	1
the	1
forenoon.	1
O	1
the	1
horseman's	1
and	1
horsewoman's	1
joys!	1
The	1
saddle,	1
the	1
gallop,	1
the	1
pressure	1
upon	1
the	1
seat,	1
the	1
cool	1
gurgling	1
by	1
the	1
ears	1
and	1
hair.	1
O	1
the	1
fireman's	1
joys!	1
I	1
hear	1
the	1
alarm	1
at	1
dead	1
of	1
night,	1
I	1
hear	1
bells,	1
shouts!	1
I	1
pass	1
the	1
crowd,	1
I	1
run!	1
The	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
flames	1
maddens	1
me	1
with	1
pleasure.	1
O	1
the	1
joy	1
of	1
the	1
strong-brawn'd	1
fighter,	1
towering	1
in	1
the	1
arena	1
in	1
perfect	1
condition,	1
conscious	1
of	1
power,	1
thirsting	1
to	1
meet	1
his	1
opponent.	1
O	1
the	1
joy	1
of	1
that	1
vast	1
elemental	1
sympathy	1
which	1
only	1
the	1
human	1
soul	1
is	1
capable	1
of	1
generating	1
and	1
emitting	1
in	1
steady	1
and	1
limitless	1
floods.	1
O	1
the	1
mother's	1
joys!	1
The	1
watching,	1
the	1
endurance,	1
the	1
precious	1
love,	1
the	1
anguish,	1
the	1
patiently	1
yielded	1
life.	1
O	1
the	1
of	1
increase,	1
growth,	1
recuperation,	1
The	1
joy	1
of	1
soothing	1
and	1
pacifying,	1
the	1
joy	1
of	1
concord	1
and	1
harmony.	1
O	1
to	1
go	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
I	1
was	1
born,	1
To	1
hear	1
the	1
birds	1
sing	1
once	1
more,	1
To	1
ramble	1
about	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
barn	1
and	1
over	1
the	1
fields	1
once	1
more,	1
And	1
through	1
the	1
orchard	1
and	1
along	1
the	1
old	1
lanes	1
once	1
more.	1
O	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
brought	1
up	1
on	1
bays,	1
lagoons,	1
creeks,	1
or	1
along	1
the	1
coast,	1
To	1
continue	1
and	1
be	1
employ'd	1
there	1
all	1
my	1
life,	1
The	1
briny	1
and	1
damp	1
smell,	1
the	1
shore,	1
the	1
salt	1
weeds	1
exposed	1
at	1
low	1
water,	1
The	1
work	1
of	1
fishermen,	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
eel-fisher	1
and	1
clam-fisher;	1
I	1
come	1
with	1
my	1
clam-rake	1
and	1
spade,	1
I	1
come	1
with	1
my	1
eel-spear,	1
Is	1
the	1
tide	1
out?	1
I	1
Join	1
the	1
group	1
of	1
clam-diggers	1
on	1
the	1
flats,	1
I	1
laugh	1
and	1
work	1
with	1
them,	1
I	1
joke	1
at	1
my	1
work	1
like	1
a	1
mettlesome	1
young	1
man;	1
In	1
winter	1
I	1
take	1
my	1
eel-basket	1
and	1
eel-spear	1
and	1
travel	1
out	1
on	1
foot	1
on	1
the	1
ice--I	1
have	1
a	1
small	1
axe	1
to	1
cut	1
holes	1
in	1
the	1
ice,	1
Behold	1
me	1
well-clothed	1
going	1
gayly	1
or	1
returning	1
in	1
the	1
afternoon,	1
my	1
brood	1
of	1
tough	1
boys	1
accompanying	1
me,	1
My	1
brood	1
of	1
grown	1
and	1
part-grown	1
boys,	1
who	1
love	1
to	1
be	1
with	1
no	1
one	1
else	1
so	1
well	1
as	1
they	1
love	1
to	1
be	1
with	1
me,	1
By	1
day	1
to	1
work	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
by	1
night	1
to	1
sleep	1
with	1
me.	1
Another	1
time	1
in	1
warm	1
weather	1
out	1
in	1
a	1
boat,	1
to	1
lift	1
the	1
lobster-pots	1
where	1
they	1
are	1
sunk	1
with	1
heavy	1
stones,	1
(I	1
know	1
the	1
buoys,)	1
O	1
the	1
sweetness	1
of	1
the	1
Fifth-month	1
morning	1
upon	1
the	1
water	1
as	1
I	1
row	1
just	1
before	1
sunrise	1
toward	1
the	1
buoys,	1
I	1
pull	1
the	1
wicker	1
pots	1
up	1
slantingly,	1
the	1
dark	1
green	1
lobsters	1
are	1
desperate	1
with	1
their	1
claws	1
as	1
I	1
take	1
them	1
out,	1
I	1
insert	1
wooden	1
pegs	1
in	1
the	1
'oints	1
of	1
their	1
pincers,	1
I	1
go	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
places	1
one	1
after	1
another,	1
and	1
then	1
row	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
shore,	1
There	1
in	1
a	1
huge	1
kettle	1
of	1
boiling	1
water	1
the	1
lobsters	1
shall	1
be	1
boil'd	1
till	1
their	1
color	1
becomes	1
scarlet.	1
Another	1
time	1
mackerel-taking,	1
Voracious,	1
mad	1
for	1
the	1
hook,	1
near	1
the	1
surface,	1
they	1
seem	1
to	1
fill	1
the	1
water	1
for	1
miles;	1
Another	1
time	1
fishing	1
for	1
rock-fish	1
in	1
Chesapeake	1
bay,	1
I	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
brown-faced	1
crew;	1
Another	1
time	1
trailing	1
for	1
blue-fish	1
off	1
Paumanok,	1
I	1
stand	1
with	1
braced	1
body,	1
My	1
left	1
foot	1
is	1
on	1
the	1
gunwale,	1
my	1
right	1
arm	1
throws	1
far	1
out	1
the	1
coils	1
of	1
slender	1
rope,	1
In	1
sight	1
around	1
me	1
the	1
quick	1
veering	1
and	1
darting	1
of	1
fifty	1
skiffs,	1
my	1
companions.	1
O	1
boating	1
on	1
the	1
rivers,	1
The	1
voyage	1
down	1
the	1
St.	1
Lawrence,	1
the	1
superb	1
scenery,	1
the	1
steamers,	1
The	1
ships	1
sailing,	1
the	1
Thousand	1
Islands,	1
the	1
occasional	1
timber-raft	1
and	1
the	1
raftsmen	1
with	1
long-reaching	1
sweep-oars,	1
The	1
little	1
huts	1
on	1
the	1
rafts,	1
and	1
the	1
stream	1
of	1
smoke	1
when	1
they	1
cook	1
supper	1
at	1
evening.	1
(O	1
something	1
pernicious	1
and	1
dread!	1
Something	1
far	1
away	1
from	1
a	1
puny	1
and	1
pious	1
life!	1
Something	1
unproved!	1
something	1
in	1
a	1
trance!	1
Something	1
escaped	1
from	1
the	1
anchorage	1
and	1
driving	1
free.)	1
O	1
to	1
work	1
in	1
mines,	1
or	1
forging	1
iron,	1
Foundry	1
casting,	1
the	1
foundry	1
itself,	1
the	1
rude	1
high	1
roof,	1
the	1
ample	1
and	1
shadow'd	1
space,	1
The	1
furnace,	1
the	1
hot	1
liquid	1
pour'd	1
out	1
and	1
running.	1
O	1
to	1
resume	1
the	1
joys	1
of	1
the	1
soldier!	1
To	1
feel	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
a	1
brave	1
commanding	1
officer--to	1
feel	1
his	1
sympathy!	1
To	1
behold	1
his	1
calmness--to	1
be	1
warm'd	1
in	1
the	1
rays	1
of	1
his	1
smile!	1
To	1
go	1
to	1
battle--to	1
hear	1
the	1
bugles	1
play	1
and	1
the	1
drums	1
beat!	1
To	1
hear	1
the	1
crash	1
of	1
artillery--to	1
see	1
the	1
glittering	1
of	1
the	1
bayonets	1
and	1
musket-barrels	1
in	1
the	1
sun!	1
To	1
see	1
men	1
fall	1
and	1
die	1
and	1
not	1
complain!	1
To	1
taste	1
the	1
savage	1
taste	1
of	1
blood--to	1
be	1
so	1
devilish!	1
To	1
gloat	1
so	1
over	1
the	1
wounds	1
and	1
deaths	1
of	1
the	1
enemy.	1
O	1
the	1
whaleman's	1
joys!	1
O	1
I	1
cruise	1
my	1
old	1
cruise	1
again!	1
I	1
feel	1
the	1
ship's	1
motion	1
under	1
me,	1
I	1
feel	1
the	1
Atlantic	1
breezes	1
fanning	1
me,	1
I	1
hear	1
the	1
cry	1
again	1
sent	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
mast-head,	1
There--she	1
blows!	1
Again	1
I	1
spring	1
up	1
the	1
rigging	1
to	1
look	1
with	1
the	1
rest--we	1
descend,	1
wild	1
with	1
excitement,	1
I	1
leap	1
in	1
the	1
lower'd	1
boat,	1
we	1
row	1
toward	1
our	1
prey	1
where	1
he	1
lies,	1
We	1
approach	1
stealthy	1
and	1
silent,	1
I	1
see	1
the	1
mountainous	1
mass,	1
lethargic,	1
basking,	1
I	1
see	1
the	1
harpooneer	1
standing	1
up,	1
I	1
see	1
the	1
weapon	1
dart	1
from	1
his	1
vigorous	1
arm;	1
O	1
swift	1
again	1
far	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
ocean	1
the	1
wounded	1
whale,	1
settling,	1
running	1
to	1
windward,	1
tows	1
me,	1
Again	1
I	1
see	1
him	1
rise	1
to	1
breathe,	1
we	1
row	1
close	1
again,	1
I	1
see	1
a	1
lance	1
driven	1
through	1
his	1
side,	1
press'd	1
deep,	1
turn'd	1
in	1
the	1
wound,	1
Again	1
we	1
back	1
off,	1
I	1
see	1
him	1
settle	1
again,	1
the	1
life	1
is	1
leaving	1
him	1
fast,	1
As	1
he	1
rises	1
he	1
spouts	1
blood,	1
I	1
see	1
him	1
swim	1
in	1
circles	1
narrower	1
and	1
narrower,	1
swiftly	1
cutting	1
the	1
water--I	1
see	1
him	1
die,	1
He	1
gives	1
one	1
convulsive	1
leap	1
in	1
the	1
centre	1
of	1
the	1
circle,	1
and	1
then	1
falls	1
flat	1
and	1
still	1
in	1
the	1
bloody	1
foam.	1
O	1
the	1
old	1
manhood	1
of	1
me,	1
my	1
noblest	1
joy	1
of	1
all!	1
My	1
children	1
and	1
grand-children,	1
my	1
white	1
hair	1
and	1
beard,	1
My	1
largeness,	1
calmness,	1
majesty,	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
long	1
stretch	1
of	1
my	1
life.	1
O	1
ripen'd	1
joy	1
of	1
womanhood!	1
O	1
happiness	1
at	1
last!	1
I	1
am	1

eighty	1

I	1

mother,	1
How	1
clear	1
is	1
my	1
mind--how	1
all	1
people	1
draw	1
nigh	1
to	1
me!	1
What	1
attractions	1
are	1
these	1
beyond	1
any	1
before?	1
what	1
bloom	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
bloom	1
of	1
youth?	1
What	1
beauty	1
is	1
this	1
that	1
descends	1
upon	1
me	1
and	1
rises	1
out	1
of	1
me?	1
O	1
the	1
orator's	1
joys!	1
To	1
inflate	1
the	1
chest,	1
to	1
roll	1
the	1
thunder	1
of	1
the	1
voice	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
ribs	1
and	1
throat,	1
To	1
make	1
the	1
people	1
rage,	1
weep,	1
hate,	1
desire,	1
with	1
yourself,	1
To	1
lead	1
America--to	1
quell	1
America	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
tongue.	1
O	1
the	1
joy	1
of	1
my	1
soul	1
leaning	1
pois'd	1
on	1
itself,	1
receiving	1
identity	1
through	1
materials	1
and	1
loving	1
them,	1
observing	1
characters	1
and	1
absorbing	1
them,	1
My	1
soul	1
vibrated	1
back	1
to	1
me	1
from	1
them,	1
from	1
sight,	1
hearing,	1
touch,	1
reason,	1
articulation,	1
comparison,	1
memory,	1
and	1
the	1
like,	1
The	1
real	1
life	1
of	1
my	1
senses	1
and	1
flesh	1
transcending	1
my	1
senses	1
and	1
flesh,	1
My	1
body	1
done	1
with	1
materials,	1
my	1
sight	1
done	1
with	1
my	1
material	1
eyes,	1
Proved	1
to	1
me	1
this	1
day	1
beyond	1
cavil	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
my	1
material	1
eyes	1
which	1
finally	1
see,	1
Nor	1
my	1
material	1
body	1
which	1
finally	1
loves,	1
walks,	1
laughs,	1
shouts,	1
embraces,	1
procreates.	1
O	1
the	1
farmer's	1
joys!	1
Ohioan's,	1
Illinoisian's,	1
Wisconsinese',	1
Kanadian's,	1
Iowan's,	1
Kansian's,	1
Missourian's,	1
Oregonese'	1
joys!	1
To	1
rise	1
at	1
peep	1
of	1
day	1
and	1
pass	1
forth	1
nimbly	1
to	1
work,	1
To	1
plough	1
land	1
in	1
the	1
fall	1
for	1
winter-sown	1
crops,	1
To	1
plough	1

To	1
train	1

swimming-bath,	1
or	1
in	1
a	1
good	1
place	1
along	1
shore,	1

to	1
walk	1
ankle-deep,	1
or	1
race	1
naked	1
along	1
the	1

O	1
to	1
realize	1
space!	1
The	1
plenteousness	1
of	1
all,	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
no	1
bounds,	1
To	1
emerge	1
and	1

none,	1
to	1
defer	1
to	1
none,	1
not	1
to	1
any	1
tyrant	1

unknown,	1
To	1
walk	1

springy	1
and	1
elastic,	1
To	1
look	1
with	1

To	1
speak	1

out	1

To	1

Knowist	1

the	1
excellent	1
joys	1
of	1
youth?	1
Joys	1
of	1
the	1
dear	1
companions	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
merry	1
word	1
and	1
laughing	1

Joy	1
of	1
the	1
glad	1
light-beaming	1
day,	1
joy	1
of	1
the	1
wide-breath'd	1
games?	1
Joy	1
of	1
sweet	1
music,	1
joy	1
of	1
the	1
lighted	1
ball-room	1
and	1
the	1
dancers?	1
Joy	1
of	1
the	1
plenteous	1
dinner,	1
strong	1
carouse	1
and	1
drinking?	1
Yet	1
O	1
my	1
soul	1
supreme!	1
Knowist	1
thou	1
the	1
joys	1
of	1
pensive	1
thought?	1
Joys	1
of	1
the	1
free	1
and	1
lonesome	1
heart,	1
the	1
tender,	1
gloomy	1
heart?	1
Joys	1
of	1
the	1
solitary	1
walk,	1
the	1
spirit	1
bow'd	1
yet	1
proud,	1
the	1
suffering	1
and	1
the	1
struggle?	1
The	1
agonistic	1
throes,	1
the	1
ecstasies,	1
joys	1
of	1
the	1
solemn	1
musings	1
day	1
or	1
night?	1
Joys	1
of	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
Death,	1
the	1
great	1
spheres	1
Time	1
and	1
Space?	1
Prophetic	1
joys	1
of	1
better,	1
loftier	1
love's	1
ideals,	1
the	1
divine	1
wife,	1
the	1
sweet,	1
eternal,	1
perfect	1
comrade?	1
Joys	1
all	1
thine	1
own	1
undying	1
one,	1
joys	1
worthy	1
thee	1
O	1
soul.	1
O	1
while	1
I	1
live	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
ruler	1
of	1
life,	1
not	1
a	1
slave,	1
To	1
meet	1
life	1
as	1
a	1
powerful	1
conqueror,	1
No	1
fumes,	1
no	1
ennui,	1
no	1
more	1
complaints	1
or	1
scornful	1
criticisms,	1
To	1
these	1
proud	1
laws	1
of	1
the	1
air,	1
the	1
water	1
and	1
the	1
ground,	1
proving	1
my	1
interior	1
soul	1
impregnable,	1
And	1
nothing	1
exterior	1
shall	1
ever	1
take	1
command	1
of	1
me.	1
For	1
not	1
life's	1
joys	1
alone	1
I	1
sing,	1
repeating--the	1
joy	1
of	1
death!	1
The	1
beautiful	1
touch	1
of	1
Death,	1
soothing	1
and	1
benumbing	1
a	1
few	1
moments,	1
for	1
reasons,	1
Myself	1
discharging	1
my	1
excrementitious	1
body	1
to	1
be	1
burn'd,	1
or	1
render'd	1
to	1
powder,	1
or	1
buried,	1
My	1
real	1
body	1
doubtless	1
left	1
to	1
me	1
for	1
other	1
spheres,	1
My	1
voided	1
body	1
nothing	1
more	1
to	1
me,	1
returning	1
to	1
the	1
purifications,	1
further	1
offices,	1
eternal	1
uses	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
O	1
to	1
attract	1
by	1
more	1
than	1
attraction!	1
How	1
it	1
is	1
I	1
know	1
not--yet	1
behold!	1
the	1
something	1
which	1
obeys	1
none	1
of	1
the	1
rest,	1
It	1
is	1
offensive,	1
never	1
defensive--yet	1
how	1
magnetic	1
it	1
draws.	1
O	1
to	1
struggle	1
against	1
great	1
odds,	1
to	1
meet	1
enemies	1
undaunted!	1
To	1
be	1
entirely	1
alone	1
with	1
them,	1
to	1
find	1
how	1
much	1
one	1
can	1
stand!	1
To	1
look	1
strife,	1
torture,	1
prison,	1
popular	1
odium,	1
face	1
to	1
face!	1
To	1
mount	1
the	1
scaffold,	1
to	1
advance	1
to	1
the	1
muzzles	1
of	1
guns	1
with	1
perfect	1
nonchalance!	1
To	1
be	1
indeed	1
a	1
God!	1
O	1
to	1
sail	1
to	1
sea	1
in	1
a	1
ship!	1
To	1
leave	1
this	1
steady	1
unendurable	1
land,	1
To	1
leave	1
the	1
tiresome	1
sameness	1
of	1
the	1
streets,	1
the	1
sidewalks	1
and	1
the	1
houses,	1
To	1
leave	1
you	1
O	1
you	1
solid	1
motionless	1
land,	1
and	1
entering	1
a	1
ship,	1
To	1
sail	1
and	1
sail	1
and	1
sail!	1
O	1
to	1
have	1
life	1
henceforth	1
a	1
poem	1
of	1
new	1
joys!	1
To	1
dance,	1
clap	1
hands,	1
exult,	1
shout,	1
skip,	1
leap,	1
roll	1
on,	1
float	1
on!	1
To	1
be	1
a	1
sailor	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
bound	1
for	1
all	1
ports,	1
A	1
ship	1
itself,	1
(see	1
indeed	1
these	1
sails	1
I	1
spread	1
to	1
the	1
sun	1
and	1
air,)	1
A	1
swift	1
and	1
swelling	1
ship	1
full	1
of	1
rich	1
words,	1
full	1
of	1
joys.	1

The	1
place	1
where	1

merely,	1
Nor	1
the	1

with	1
the	1

belov'd	1
by	1

no	1

Where	1

Where	1
the	1

Where	1
the	1

the	1

Where	1
outside	1

Where	1

and	1
President,	1
Mayor,	1
Governor	1

the	1

(Ah	1

After	1

But	1
to	1
bring	1

from	1
afar	1
what	1
is	1
already	1

To	1
give	1
it	1
our	1

To	1
fill	1

To	1

Responsive	1
to	1

her	1
long-nurs'd	1

Join'd	1
with	1
an	1

natural	1

She	1
comes!	1
I	1

I	1
scent	1
the	1
odor	1
of	1
her	1

I	1
mark	1

a-turning,	1
rolling,	1
Upon	1
this	1

The	1
dame	1
of	1
dames!	1
can	1
I	1
believe	1
then,	1
Those	1
ancient	1
temples,	1
sculptures	1
classic,	1
could	1
none	1
of	1
them	1
retain	1
her?	1
Nor	1
shades	1
of	1
Virgil	1

Dante,	1
nor	1
myriad	1
memories,	1
poems,	1
old	1
associations,	1
magnetize	1
and	1
hold	1
on	1
to	1
her?	1
But	1
that	1
she's	1
left	1
them	1
all--and	1
here?	1
Yes,	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
allow	1
me	1
to	1
say	1
so,	1
I,	1
my	1
friends,	1
if	1
you	1
do	1
not,	1
can	1
plainly	1
see	1
her,	1
The	1
same	1
undying	1
soul	1
of	1
earth's,	1
activity's,	1
beauty's,	1
heroism's	1
expression,	1
Out	1

Pass'd	1
to	1
its	1
charnel	1

coffin'd	1
with	1

Blazon'd	1
with	1
Shakspere's	1

And	1
dirged	1
by	1
Tennyson's	1
sweet	1
sad	1
rhyme.	1
I	1
say	1
I	1
see,	1
my	1
friends,	1
if	1
you	1
do	1
not,	1
the	1
illustrious	1
emigre,	1
(having	1
it	1
is	1
true	1
in	1
her	1
day,	1
although	1
the	1
same,	1
changed,	1
journey'd	1
considerable,)	1
Making	1
directly	1
for	1
this	1
rendezvous,	1
vigorously	1
clearing	1
a	1
path	1
for	1
herself,	1
striding	1
through	1
the	1
confusion,	1
By	1
thud	1
of	1
machinery	1
and	1
shrill	1
steam-whistle	1
undismay'd,	1
Bluff'd	1
not	1
a	1
bit	1
by	1
drain-pipe,	1
gasometers,	1
artificial	1
fertilizers,	1
Smiling	1
and	1
pleas'd	1
with	1
palpable	1
intent	1
to	1
stay,	1
She's	1
here,	1
install'd	1
amid	1
the	1
kitchen	1
ware!	1
4	1
But	1
hold--don't	1
I	1
forget	1
my	1
manners?	1
To	1
introduce	1
the	1
stranger,	1
(what	1
else	1
indeed	1
do	1
I	1
live	1
to	1
chant	1
for?)	1
to	1
thee	1
Columbia;	1
In	1
liberty's	1
name	1
welcome	1
immortal!	1
clasp	1
hands,	1
And	1
ever	1
henceforth	1
sisters	1
dear	1
be	1
both.	1
Fear	1
not	1
O	1
Muse!	1
truly	1
new	1
ways	1
and	1
days	1
receive,	1
surround	1
you,	1
I	1
candidly	1
confess	1
a	1
queer,	1
queer	1
race,	1
of	1
novel	1
fashion,	1
And	1
yet	1
the	1
same	1
old	1
human	1
race,	1
the	1
same	1
within,	1
without,	1
Faces	1
and	1
hearts	1
the	1
same,	1
feelings	1
the	1
same,	1
yearnings	1
the	1
same,	1
The	1
same	1
old	1
love,	1
beauty	1
and	1
use	1
the	1
same.	1

We	1
do	1
not	1
blame	1
thee	1
elder	1
World,	1
nor	1
really	1
separate	1
ourselves	1
from	1
thee,	1
(Would	1
the	1
son	1
separate	1
himself	1
from	1
the	1
father?)	1
Looking	1
back	1
on	1
thee,	1
seeing	1
thee	1
to	1
thy	1
duties,	1
grandeurs,	1
through	1
past	1
ages	1
bending,	1
building,	1
We	1
build	1
to	1
ours	1
to-day.	1
Mightier	1
than	1
Egypt's	1
tombs,	1
Fairer	1
than	1
Grecia's,	1
Roma's	1
temples,	1
Prouder	1
than	1
Milan's	1
statued,	1
spired	1
cathedral,	1
More	1
picturesque	1
than	1
Rhenish	1
castle-keeps,	1
We	1
plan	1
even	1
now	1
to	1
raise,	1
beyond	1
them	1
all,	1
Thy	1
great	1
cathedral	1
sacred	1
industry,	1
no	1
tomb,	1
A	1
keep	1
for	1
life	1
for	1
practical	1
invention.	1
As	1
in	1
a	1
waking	1
vision,	1
E'en	1
while	1
I	1
chant	1
I	1
see	1
it	1
rise,	1
I	1
scan	1
and	1
prophesy	1
outside	1
and	1
in,	1
Its	1
manifold	1
ensemble.	1
Around	1
a	1
palace,	1
loftier,	1
fairer,	1
ampler	1
than	1
any	1
yet,	1
Earth's	1
modern	1
wonder,	1
history's	1
seven	1
outstripping,	1
High	1
rising	1
tier	1
on	1
tier	1
with	1
glass	1
and	1

Gladdening	1
the	1

enhued	1
in	1
cheerfulest	1
hues,	1
Bronze,	1
lilac,	1
robin's-egg,	1
marine	1
and	1
crimson,	1
Over	1
whose	1
golden	1
roof	1
shall	1
flaunt,	1
beneath	1
thy	1
banner	1

Delicate	1
beauty,	1
a	1

to	1
thee,	1
(it	1
may	1
be	1

Remember	1
thou	1
hast	1
not	1
always	1
been	1
as	1
here	1
to-day	1
so	1
comfortably	1
ensovereign'd,	1
In	1

I	1
observ'd	1
thee	1

Not	1
quite	1

trim	1
and	1
whole	1
and	1
freshly	1
blooming	1
in	1

stainless	1

But	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
thee	1
bunting,	1
to	1
tatters	1
torn	1
upon	1
thy	1
splinter'd	1
staff,	1
Or	1
clutch'd	1
to	1
some	1
young	1
color-bearer's	1
breast	1
with	1
desperate	1
hands,	1
Savagely	1
struggled	1
for,	1
for	1
life	1
or	1
death,	1
fought	1
over	1
long,	1
'Mid	1

thunder-crash	1
and	1
many	1
a	1
curse	1
and	1
groan	1
and	1

cracking	1
sharp,	1
And	1
moving	1
masses	1
as	1
wild	1
demons	1
surging,	1
and	1
lives	1
as	1
nothing	1
risk'd,	1
For	1
thy	1
mere	1
remnant	1
grimed	1
with	1
dirt	1
and	1
smoke	1
and	1
sopp'd	1
in	1

For	1
sake	1
of	1
that,	1
my	1
beauty,	1
and	1
that	1
thou	1
might'st	1
dally	1
as	1
now	1
secure	1
up	1
there,	1
Many	1
a	1
good	1
man	1
have	1
I	1
seen	1
go	1
under.	1
Now	1
here	1
and	1
these	1
and	1
hence	1
in	1
peace,	1
all	1
thine	1
O	1
Flag!	1
And	1
here	1
and	1
hence	1
for	1
thee,	1
O	1
universal	1
Muse!	1
and	1
thou	1
for	1
them!	1
And	1
here	1
and	1
hence	1
O	1
Union,	1
all	1
the	1
work	1
and	1
workmen	1
thine!	1
None	1
separate	1
from	1
thee--henceforth	1
One	1
only,	1
we	1
and	1
thou,	1
(For	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
children,	1
what	1
is	1
it,	1
only	1
the	1

We	1

dryads,	1
fading,	1
departing,	1
or	1
hamadryads	1
departing,	1
A	1
murmuring,	1
fateful,	1
giant	1
voice,	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
sky,	1
Voice	1
of	1
a	1
mighty	1
dying	1
tree	1
in	1
the	1
redwood	1
forest	1
dense.	1
Farewell	1
my	1
brethren,	1
Farewell	1
O	1
earth	1
and	1
sky,	1
farewell	1
ye	1
neighboring	1
waters,	1
My	1
time	1
has	1
ended,	1
my	1
term	1
has	1
come.	1
Along	1
the	1
northern	1
coast,	1
Just	1
back	1
from	1
the	1
rock-bound	1
shore	1
and	1
the	1
caves,	1
In	1
the	1
saline	1
air	1
from	1
the	1
sea	1
in	1
the	1
Mendocino	1
country,	1
With	1
the	1
surge	1
for	1
base	1
and	1
accompaniment	1
low	1
and	1
hoarse,	1
With	1
crackling	1
blows	1
of	1
axes	1
sounding	1
musically	1
driven	1
by	1
strong	1
arms,	1
Riven	1
deep	1
by	1
the	1
sharp	1
tongues	1
of	1
the	1
axes,	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
redwood	1
forest	1
dense,	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
might	1
tree	1
its	1
death-chant	1
chanting.	1
The	1
choppers	1
heard	1
not,	1
the	1
camp	1
shanties	1
echoed	1
not,	1
The	1
quick-ear'd	1
teamsters	1
and	1
chain	1
and	1
jack-screw	1
men	1
heard	1
not,	1
As	1
the	1
wood-spirits	1
came	1
from	1
their	1
haunts	1
of	1
a	1
thousand	1
years	1
to	1
join	1
the	1
refrain,	1
But	1
in	1
my	1
soul	1
I	1
plainly	1
heard.	1
Murmuring	1
out	1
of	1
its	1
myriad	1
leaves,	1
Down	1
from	1
its	1
lofty	1
top	1
rising	1
two	1
hundred	1
feet	1
high,	1
Out	1
of	1
its	1
stalwart	1
trunk	1
and	1
limbs,	1
out	1
of	1
its	1
foot-thick	1
bark,	1
That	1
chant	1
of	1
the	1
seasons	1
and	1
time,	1
chant	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
past	1
only	1
but	1
the	1
future.	1
You	1
untold	1
life	1
of	1
me,	1
And	1
all	1
you	1
venerable	1
and	1
innocent	1
joys,	1
Perennial	1
hardy	1
life	1
of	1
me	1
with	1
joys	1
'mid	1
rain	1
and	1
many	1
a	1
summer	1
sun,	1
And	1
the	1
white	1
snows	1
and	1
night	1
and	1
the	1
wild	1
winds;	1
O	1
the	1
great	1
patient	1
rugged	1
joys,	1
my	1
soul's	1
strong	1
joys	1
unreck'd	1
by	1
man,	1
(For	1

bear	1
the	1

Our	1

our	1

come.	1
Nor	1
yield	1
we	1
mournfully	1
majestic	1
brothers,	1
We	1
who	1
have	1
grandly	1
fill'd	1
our	1
time,	1
With	1
Nature's	1
calm	1
content,	1
with	1
tacit	1
huge	1
delight,	1
We	1
welcome	1
what	1
we	1
wrought	1
for	1
through	1
the	1
past,	1
And	1
leave	1
the	1
field	1
for	1
them.	1
For	1
them	1
predicted	1
long,	1
For	1
a	1
superber	1
race,	1
they	1
too	1
to	1
grandly	1
fill	1
their	1
time,	1
For	1
them	1
we	1
abdicate,	1
in	1
them	1
ourselves	1

In	1
them	1
these	1
skies	1

these	1
mountain	1
peaks,	1
Shasta,	1
Nevadas,	1
These	1
huge	1
precipitous	1
cliffs,	1
this	1
amplitude,	1
these	1
valleys,	1
far	1
Yosemite,	1
To	1
be	1
in	1
them	1
absorb'd,	1
assimilated.	1
Then	1
to	1
a	1
loftier	1
strain,	1
Still	1
prouder,	1
more	1
ecstatic	1
rose	1
the	1
chant,	1
As	1
if	1
the	1
heirs,	1
the	1
deities	1
of	1
the	1
West,	1
Joining	1
with	1
master-tongue	1
bore	1
part.	1
Not	1
wan	1

A	1

In	1
the	1
labor	1
of	1

trades	1
and	1
the	1
labor	1
of	1
fields	1
I	1
find	1
the	1
developments,	1
And	1
find	1
the	1
eternal	1
meanings.	1
Workmen	1
and	1
Workwomen!	1
Were	1
all	1
educations	1
practical	1
and	1
ornamental	1
well	1
display'd	1
out	1

what	1
would	1
it	1
amount	1
to?	1
Were	1
I	1
as	1
the	1

charitable	1
proprietor,	1
wise	1
statesman,	1
what	1
would	1

amount	1
to?	1
Were	1
I	1
to	1
you	1

the	1

would	1
that	1

The	1

and	1
the	1

A	1

never	1

Neither	1

I	1
take	1
no	1
sooner	1
a	1

I	1

I	1
will	1
be	1

If	1
your	1
lover,	1
husband,	1

is	1
welcome	1
by	1
day	1

I	1
must	1
be	1

If	1

Why	1

the	1
same	1
I	1
see,	1
None	1
shall	1
escape	1
me	1
and	1
none	1
shall	1
wish	1
to	1
escape	1
me.	1
I	1
bring	1
what	1
you	1
much	1
need	1
yet	1
always	1
have,	1
Not	1
money,	1
amours,	1
dress,	1
eating,	1
erudition,	1
but	1
as	1
good,	1
I	1
send	1
no	1
agent	1
or	1
medium,	1
offer	1
no	1
representative	1
of	1
value,	1
but	1
offer	1
the	1
value	1
itself.	1
There	1
is	1
something	1
that	1
comes	1
to	1
one	1
now	1
and	1
perpetually,	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
what	1
is	1
printed,	1
preach'd,	1
discussed,	1
it	1
eludes	1
discussion	1
and	1
print,	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
put	1
in	1
a	1
book,	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
this	1
book,	1
It	1
is	1
for	1
you	1
whoever	1
you	1
are,	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
farther	1
from	1
you	1
than	1
your	1
hearing	1
and	1
sight	1
are	1
from	1
you,	1
It	1
is	1
hinted	1
by	1
nearest,	1
commonest,	1
readiest,	1
it	1
is	1
ever	1
provoked	1
by	1
them.	1
You	1
may	1
read	1
in	1
many	1
languages,	1
yet	1
read	1
nothing	1
about	1
it,	1
You	1
may	1
read	1
the	1
President's	1
message	1
and	1
read	1
nothing	1
about	1
it	1
there,	1
Nothing	1
in	1
the	1
reports	1
from	1
the	1
State	1
department	1
or	1
Treasury	1
department,	1
or	1
in	1
the	1
daily	1

weekly	1

Or	1
in	1
the	1
census	1
or	1
revenue	1

current,	1
or	1
any	1

of	1

3	1
The	1
sun	1
and	1
stars	1
that	1
float	1
in	1
the	1
open	1
air,	1
The	1
apple-shaped	1
earth	1
and	1
we	1
upon	1
it,	1
surely	1
the	1
drift	1
of	1
them	1
is	1
something	1
grand,	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
except	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
grand,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
happiness,	1
And	1
that	1
the	1
enclosing	1
purport	1
of	1
us	1
here	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
speculation	1
or	1
bon-mot	1
or	1
reconnoissance,	1
And	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
something	1
which	1
by	1
luck	1
may	1
turn	1
out	1
well	1
for	1
us,	1
and	1
without	1
luck	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
failure	1
for	1
us,	1
And	1
not	1
something	1
which	1
may	1
yet	1
be	1
retracted	1
in	1
a	1
certain	1
contingency.	1
The	1
light	1
and	1
shade,	1
the	1
curious	1
sense	1
of	1
body	1
and	1
identity,	1
the	1
greed	1
that	1
with	1
perfect	1
complaisance	1
devours	1
all	1
things,	1
The	1
endless	1
pride	1
and	1
outstretching	1
of	1
man,	1
unspeakable	1
joys	1
and	1
sorrows,	1
The	1
wonder	1
every	1
one	1
sees	1
in	1
every	1
one	1
else	1
he	1
sees,	1
and	1
the	1
wonders	1
that	1
fill	1
each	1
minute	1
of	1
time	1
forever,	1
What	1
have	1
you	1
reckon'd	1
them	1
for,	1

Have	1
you	1

your	1

or	1
for	1
the	1
profits	1
of	1
your	1

Or	1
to	1
achieve	1

a	1

or	1
to	1
fill	1
a	1
gentleman's	1
leisure,	1
or	1
a	1
lady's	1
leisure?	1
Have	1
you	1
reckon'd	1
that	1
the	1
landscape	1
took	1
substance	1
and	1
form	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
painted	1
in	1
a	1
picture?	1
Or	1
men	1
and	1
women	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
written	1
of,	1
and	1
songs	1
sung?	1
Or	1
the	1
attraction	1
of	1
gravity,	1
and	1
the	1
great	1
laws	1
and	1
harmonious	1
combinations	1
and	1
the	1
fluids	1
of	1
the	1

as	1

Or	1
the	1
brown	1
land	1
and	1
the	1
blue	1
sea	1
for	1
maps	1
and	1

Or	1
the	1
stars	1
to	1
be	1
put	1
in	1
constellations	1
and	1
named	1
fancy	1
names?	1
Or	1
that	1
the	1
growth	1
of	1
seeds	1
is	1
for	1
agricultural	1
tables,	1
or	1
agriculture	1
itself?	1
Old	1
institutions,	1
these	1
arts,	1
libraries,	1
legends,	1
collections,	1
and	1
the	1
practice	1
handed	1
along	1
in	1
manufactures,	1
will	1
we	1
rate	1
them	1
so	1
high?	1
Will	1
we	1
rate	1
our	1
cash	1
and	1
business	1
high?	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
objection,	1
I	1
rate	1
them	1
as	1
high	1
as	1
the	1
highest--then	1
a	1
child	1
born	1
of	1
a	1
woman	1
and	1
man	1
I	1
rate	1
beyond	1
all	1
rate.	1
We	1
thought	1
our	1
Union	1
grand,	1
and	1
our	1
Constitution	1
grand,	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
say	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
grand	1
and	1
good,	1
for	1
they	1
are,	1
I	1
am	1
this	1
day	1
just	1
as	1
much	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
them	1
as	1
you,	1
Then	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
You,	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
my	1
fellows	1
upon	1
the	1
earth.	1
We	1
consider	1
bibles	1
and	1
religions	1
divine--I	1
do	1
not	1
say	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
divine,	1
I	1
say	1
they	1
have	1
all	1
grown	1
out	1
of	1
you,	1
and	1
may	1
grow	1
out	1
of	1
you	1
still,	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
they	1
who	1
give	1
the	1
life,	1
it	1
is	1
you	1
who	1
give	1
the	1
life,	1
Leaves	1
are	1
not	1

than	1

4	1
The	1
sum	1
of	1
all	1
known	1
reverence	1
I	1
add	1
up	1
in	1
you	1
whoever	1
you	1
are,	1
The	1
President	1
is	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
White	1
House	1
for	1
you,	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
you	1
who	1
are	1
here	1
for	1
him,	1
The	1
Secretaries	1
act	1
in	1
their	1
bureaus	1
for	1
you,	1
not	1
you	1
here	1
for	1
them,	1
The	1
Congress	1
convenes	1
every	1
Twelfth-month	1
for	1
you,	1
Laws,	1
courts,	1
the	1
forming	1
of	1
States,	1
the	1
charters	1
of	1
cities,	1
the	1
going	1

coming	1
of	1
commerce	1
and	1

are	1
all	1
for	1
you.	1
List	1
close	1
my	1
scholars	1
dear,	1
Doctrines,	1
politics	1
and	1
civilization	1
exurge	1
from	1
you,	1
Sculpture	1
and	1
monuments	1
and	1
any	1
thing	1
inscribed	1
anywhere	1
are	1
tallied	1
in	1
you,	1
The	1
gist	1
of	1
histories	1
and	1
statistics	1
as	1
far	1
back	1
as	1
the	1
records	1
reach	1
is	1
in	1
you	1
this	1
hour,	1
and	1
myths	1
and	1
tales	1
the	1
same,	1
If	1
you	1
were	1
not	1
breathing	1
and	1
walking	1
here,	1
where	1
would	1
they	1
all	1
be?	1
The	1
most	1
renown'd	1
poems	1
would	1
be	1
ashes,	1
orations	1
and	1
plays	1
would	1
be	1
vacuums.	1
All	1
architecture	1
is	1
what	1
you	1
do	1
to	1
it	1
when	1
you	1
look	1
upon	1
it,	1
(Did	1
you	1
think	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
white	1
or	1
gray	1
stone?	1
or	1
the	1
lines	1
of	1
the	1
arches	1
and	1
cornices?)	1
All	1
music	1
is	1
what	1
awakes	1
from	1
you	1
when	1
you	1
are	1
reminded	1
by	1
the	1
instruments,	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
violins	1
and	1
the	1
cornets,	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
oboe	1
nor	1
the	1
beating	1
drums,	1
nor	1
the	1
score	1
of	1
the	1
baritone	1
singer	1
singing	1
his	1
sweet	1
romanza,	1
nor	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
men's	1
chorus,	1
nor	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
women's	1
chorus,	1
It	1
is	1
nearer	1
and	1
farther	1
than	1
they.	1
5	1
Will	1
the	1
whole	1
come	1
back	1
then?	1
Can	1
each	1
see	1
signs	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
by	1
a	1
look	1
in	1
the	1
looking-glass?	1
is	1
there	1
nothing	1
greater	1
or	1
more?	1
Does	1
all	1
sit	1
there	1
with	1
you,	1
with	1
the	1
mystic	1
unseen	1
soul?	1
Strange	1
and	1
hard	1
that	1
paradox	1
true	1
I	1
give,	1
Objects	1
gross	1
and	1
the	1
unseen	1

strong	1
life,	1
And	1
all	1
else	1
giving	1
place	1
to	1
men	1
and	1
women	1
like	1
you.	1
When	1
the	1
psalm	1
sings	1
instead	1
of	1
the	1
singer,	1
When	1
the	1
script	1
preaches	1
instead	1
of	1
the	1
preacher,	1
When	1
the	1
pulpit	1
descends	1
and	1
goes	1
instead	1
of	1
the	1
carver	1
that	1
carved	1
the	1
supporting	1
desk,	1
When	1
I	1
can	1
touch	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
books	1
by	1
night	1
or	1
by	1
day,	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
touch	1
my	1
body	1
back	1
again,	1
When	1
a	1
university	1
course	1
convinces	1
like	1
a	1
slumbering	1
woman	1
and	1
child	1
convince,	1
When	1
the	1
minted	1
gold	1
in	1
the	1
vault	1
smiles	1
like	1
the	1
night-watchman's	1
daughter,	1
When	1
warrantee	1
deeds	1
loafe	1
in	1
chairs	1
opposite	1
and	1
are	1
my	1
friendly	1
companions,	1
I	1
intend	1
to	1
reach	1
them	1
my	1
hand,	1
and	1
make	1
as	1
much	1
of	1

as	1
I	1

of	1

A	1
Song	1
of	1
the	1
Rolling	1
Earth	1
1	1
A	1
song	1
of	1
the	1
rolling	1
earth,	1
and	1
of	1
words	1
according,	1
Were	1
you	1
thinking	1
that	1
those	1
were	1
the	1
words,	1
those	1
upright	1
lines?	1
those	1
curves,	1
angles,	1
dots?	1
No,	1
those	1
are	1
not	1
the	1
words,	1
the	1
substantial	1
words	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
ground	1
and	1
sea,	1
They	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
air,	1
they	1
are	1
in	1
you.	1
Were	1
you	1
thinking	1
that	1
those	1
were	1
the	1
words,	1
those	1
delicious	1
sounds	1
out	1
of	1
your	1
friends'	1
mouths?	1
No,	1
the	1
real	1
words	1
are	1
more	1
delicious	1
than	1
they.	1
Human	1
bodies	1
are	1
words,	1
myriads	1
of	1
words,	1
(In	1
the	1
best	1
poems	1
re-appears	1
the	1
body,	1
man's	1
or	1
woman's,	1
well-shaped,	1
natural,	1
gay,	1
Every	1
part	1
able,	1
active,	1
receptive,	1
without	1
shame	1
or	1
the	1
need	1
of	1
shame.)	1
Air,	1
soil,	1
water,	1
fire--those	1
are	1
words,	1
I	1
myself	1
am	1
a	1
word	1
with	1
them--my	1
qualities	1
interpenetrate	1
with	1
theirs--my	1
name	1
is	1
nothing	1
to	1
them,	1
Though	1
it	1
were	1
told	1
in	1
the	1
three	1
thousand	1
languages,	1
what	1
would	1
air,	1
soil,	1
water,	1
fire,	1
know	1
of	1
my	1
name?	1
A	1
healthy	1
presence,	1
a	1
friendly	1
or	1
commanding	1
gesture,	1
are	1
words,	1
sayings,	1
meanings,	1
The	1
charms	1
that	1
go	1
with	1
the	1
mere	1
looks	1
of	1
some	1
men	1
and	1
women,	1
are	1
sayings	1
and	1
meanings	1
also.	1
The	1
workmanship	1
of	1
souls	1
is	1
by	1
those	1
inaudible	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
The	1
masters	1
know	1
the	1
earth's	1
words	1
and	1
use	1
them	1
more	1
than	1
audible	1
words.	1
Amelioration	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
earth's	1
words,	1
The	1
earth	1
neither	1
lags	1
nor	1
hastens,	1
It	1
has	1
all	1
attributes,	1
growths,	1
effects,	1
latent	1
in	1
itself	1
from	1
the	1
jump,	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
half	1
beautiful	1
only,	1
defects	1
and	1
excrescences	1
show	1
just	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
perfections	1
show.	1
The	1
earth	1
does	1
not	1
withhold,	1
it	1
is	1
generous	1
enough,	1
The	1
truths	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
continually	1
wait,	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
so	1
conceal'd	1
either,	1
They	1
are	1
calm,	1
subtle,	1
untransmissible	1
by	1
print,	1
They	1
are	1
imbued	1
through	1
all	1
things	1
conveying	1
themselves	1
willingly,	1
Conveying	1
a	1
sentiment	1
and	1
invitation,	1
I	1
utter	1
and	1
utter,	1
I	1
speak	1
not,	1
yet	1
if	1
you	1
hear	1
me	1
not	1
of	1
what	1
avail	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
you?	1
To	1
bear,	1
to	1
better,	1
lacking	1
these	1
of	1
what	1
avail	1
am	1
I?	1
(Accouche!	1
accouchez!	1
Will	1
you	1
rot	1
your	1
own	1
fruit	1
in	1
yourself	1
there?	1
Will	1
you	1
squat	1
and	1
stifle	1
there?)	1
The	1
earth	1
does	1
not	1
argue,	1
Is	1
not	1
pathetic,	1
has	1
no	1
arrangements,	1
Does	1
not	1
scream,	1
haste,	1
persuade,	1
threaten,	1
promise,	1
Makes	1
no	1
discriminations,	1
has	1
no	1
conceivable	1
failures,	1
Closes	1
nothing,	1
refuses	1
nothing,	1
shuts	1
none	1
out,	1
Of	1
all	1
the	1
powers,	1
objects,	1
states,	1
it	1
notifies,	1
shuts	1
none	1
out.	1
The	1
earth	1
does	1
not	1
exhibit	1
itself	1
nor	1
refuse	1
to	1
exhibit	1
itself,	1
possesses	1
still	1
underneath,	1
Underneath	1
the	1
ostensible	1
sounds,	1
the	1
august	1
chorus	1
of	1
heroes,	1
the	1
wail	1
of	1
slaves,	1
Persuasions	1
of	1
lovers,	1
curses,	1
gasps	1
of	1
the	1
dying,	1
laughter	1
of	1
young	1
people,	1
accents	1
of	1
bargainers,	1
Underneath	1
these	1
possessing	1
words	1
that	1
never	1
fall.	1
To	1
her	1
children	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
eloquent	1
dumb	1
great	1
mother	1
never	1
fail,	1
The	1
true	1
words	1
do	1
not	1
fail,	1
for	1
motion	1
does	1
not	1
fail	1
and	1
reflection	1
does	1
not	1
fall,	1
Also	1
the	1
day	1
and	1
night	1
do	1
not	1
fall,	1
and	1
the	1
voyage	1
we	1
pursue	1
does	1
not	1
fall.	1
Of	1
the	1
interminable	1
sisters,	1
Of	1
the	1
ceaseless	1
cotillons	1
of	1
sisters,	1
Of	1
the	1
centripetal	1
and	1
centrifugal	1
sisters,	1
the	1
elder	1
and	1
younger	1
sisters,	1
The	1
beautiful	1
sister	1
we	1
know	1
dances	1
on	1
with	1
the	1
rest.	1
With	1
her	1
ample	1
back	1
towards	1
every	1
beholder,	1
With	1
the	1
fascinations	1
of	1
youth	1
and	1
the	1
equal	1
fascinations	1
of	1
age,	1
Sits	1
she	1
whom	1
I	1
too	1
love	1
like	1
the	1
rest,	1
sits	1
undisturb'd,	1
Holding	1
up	1
in	1
her	1
hand	1
what	1
has	1
the	1
character	1
of	1
a	1
mirror,	1
while	1
her	1
eyes	1
glance	1
back	1
from	1
it,	1
Glance	1
as	1
she	1
sits,	1
inviting	1
none,	1
denying	1
none,	1
Holding	1
a	1
mirror	1
day	1
and	1
night	1
tirelessly	1
before	1
her	1
own	1
face.	1
Seen	1
at	1
hand	1
or	1
seen	1
at	1
a	1
distance,	1
Duly	1
the	1
twenty-four	1
appear	1
in	1
public	1
every	1
day,	1
Duly	1
approach	1
and	1
pass	1
with	1
their	1
companions	1
or	1
a	1
companion,	1
Looking	1
from	1
no	1
countenances	1
of	1
their	1
own,	1
but	1
from	1
the	1
countenances	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
with	1
them,	1
From	1
the	1
countenances	1
of	1
children	1
or	1
women	1
or	1
the	1
manly	1
countenance,	1
From	1
the	1
open	1
countenances	1
of	1
animals	1
or	1
from	1
inanimate	1
things,	1
From	1
the	1
landscape	1
or	1
waters	1
or	1
from	1
the	1
exquisite	1
apparition	1
of	1
the	1
sky,	1
From	1
our	1
countenances,	1
mine	1
and	1
yours,	1
faithfully	1
returning	1
them,	1
Every	1
day	1
in	1
public	1
appearing	1
without	1
fall,	1
but	1
never	1
twice	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
companions.	1
Embracing	1
man,	1
embracing	1
all,	1
proceed	1
the	1
three	1
hundred	1
and	1
sixty-five	1
resistlessly	1
round	1
the	1
sun;	1
Embracing	1
all,	1
soothing,	1
supporting,	1
follow	1
close	1
three	1
hundred	1
and	1
sixty-five	1
offsets	1
of	1
the	1
first,	1
sure	1
and	1
necessary	1
as	1
they.	1
Tumbling	1
on	1
steadily,	1
nothing	1
dreading,	1
Sunshine,	1
storm,	1
cold,	1
heat,	1
forever	1
withstanding,	1
passing,	1
carrying,	1
The	1
soul's	1
realization	1
and	1
determination	1
still	1
inheriting,	1
The	1
fluid	1
vacuum	1
around	1
and	1
ahead	1
still	1
entering	1
and	1
dividing,	1
No	1
balk	1
retarding,	1
no	1
anchor	1
anchoring,	1
on	1
no	1
rock	1
striking,	1
Swift,	1
glad,	1
content,	1
unbereav'd,	1
nothing	1
losing,	1
Of	1
all	1
able	1
and	1
ready	1
at	1
any	1
time	1
to	1
give	1
strict	1
account,	1
The	1
divine	1
ship	1
sails	1
the	1
divine	1
sea.	1
2	1
Whoever	1
you	1
are!	1
motion	1
and	1
reflection	1
are	1
especially	1
for	1
you,	1
The	1
divine	1
ship	1
sails	1
the	1
divine	1
sea	1
for	1
you.	1
Whoever	1
you	1
are!	1
you	1
are	1
he	1
or	1
she	1
for	1
whom	1
the	1
earth	1
is	1
solid	1
and	1
liquid,	1
You	1
are	1
he	1
or	1
she	1
for	1
whom	1
the	1
sun	1
and	1
moon	1
hang	1
in	1
the	1
sky,	1
For	1
none	1
more	1
than	1
you	1
are	1
the	1
present	1
and	1
the	1
past,	1
For	1
none	1
more	1
than	1
you	1
is	1
immortality.	1
Each	1
man	1
to	1
himself	1
and	1
each	1
woman	1
to	1
herself,	1
is	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
past	1
and	1
present,	1
and	1
the	1
true	1
word	1
of	1
immortality;	1
No	1
one	1
can	1
acquire	1
for	1
another--not	1
one,	1
Not	1
one	1
can	1
grow	1
for	1
another--not	1
one.	1
The	1
song	1
is	1
to	1
the	1
singer,	1
and	1
comes	1
back	1
most	1
to	1
him,	1
The	1
teaching	1
is	1
to	1
the	1
teacher,	1
and	1
comes	1
back	1
most	1
to	1
him,	1
The	1
murder	1
is	1
to	1
the	1
murderer,	1
and	1
comes	1
back	1
most	1
to	1
him,	1
The	1
theft	1
is	1
to	1
the	1
thief,	1
and	1
comes	1
back	1
most	1
to	1
him,	1
The	1
love	1
is	1
to	1
the	1
lover,	1
and	1
comes	1
back	1
most	1
to	1
him,	1
The	1
gift	1
is	1
to	1
the	1
giver,	1
and	1
comes	1
back	1
most	1
to	1
him--it	1
cannot	1
fail,	1
The	1
oration	1
is	1
to	1
the	1
orator,	1
the	1
acting	1
is	1
to	1
the	1
actor	1
and	1
actress	1
not	1
to	1
the	1
audience,	1
And	1
no	1
man	1
understands	1
any	1
greatness	1
or	1
goodness	1
but	1
his	1
own,	1
or	1
the	1
indication	1
of	1
his	1
own.	1
3	1
I	1
swear	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
surely	1
be	1
complete	1
to	1
him	1
or	1
her	1
who	1
shall	1
be	1
complete,	1
The	1
earth	1
remains	1
jagged	1
and	1
broken	1
only	1
to	1
him	1
or	1
her	1
who	1
remains	1
jagged	1
and	1
broken.	1
I	1
swear	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
greatness	1
or	1
power	1
that	1
does	1
not	1
emulate	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
There	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
theory	1
of	1
any	1
account	1
unless	1
it	1
corroborate	1
the	1
theory	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
No	1
politics,	1
song,	1
religion,	1
behavior,	1
or	1
what	1
not,	1
is	1
of	1
account,	1
unless	1
it	1
compare	1
with	1
the	1
amplitude	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
Unless	1
it	1
face	1
the	1
exactness,	1
vitality,	1
impartiality,	1
rectitude	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
I	1
swear	1
I	1
begin	1
to	1
see	1
love	1
with	1
sweeter	1
spasms	1
than	1
that	1
which	1
responds	1
love,	1
It	1
is	1
that	1
which	1
contains	1
itself,	1
which	1
never	1
invites	1
and	1
never	1
refuses.	1
I	1
swear	1
I	1
begin	1
to	1
see	1
little	1
or	1
nothing	1
in	1
audible	1
words,	1
All	1
merges	1
toward	1
the	1
presentation	1
of	1
the	1
unspoken	1
meanings	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
Toward	1
him	1
who	1
sings	1
the	1
songs	1
of	1
the	1
body	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
truths	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
Toward	1
him	1
who	1
makes	1
the	1
dictionaries	1
of	1
words	1
that	1
print	1
cannot	1
touch.	1
I	1
swear	1
I	1
see	1
what	1
is	1
better	1
than	1
to	1
tell	1
the	1
best,	1
It	1
is	1
always	1
to	1
leave	1
the	1
best	1
untold.	1
When	1
I	1
undertake	1
to	1
tell	1
the	1
best	1
I	1
find	1
I	1
cannot,	1
My	1
tongue	1
is	1
ineffectual	1
on	1
its	1
pivots,	1
My	1
breath	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
obedient	1
to	1
its	1
organs,	1
I	1
become	1
a	1
dumb	1
man.	1
The	1
best	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
cannot	1
be	1
told	1
anyhow,	1
all	1
or	1
any	1
is	1
best,	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
what	1
you	1
anticipated,	1
it	1
is	1
cheaper,	1
easier,	1
nearer,	1
Things	1
are	1
not	1
dismiss'd	1
from	1
the	1
places	1
they	1
held	1
before,	1
The	1
earth	1
is	1
just	1
as	1
positive	1
and	1
direct	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
before,	1
Facts,	1
religions,	1
improvements,	1
politics,	1
trades,	1
are	1
as	1
real	1
as	1
before,	1
But	1
the	1
soul	1
is	1
also	1
real,	1
it	1
too	1
is	1
positive	1
and	1
direct,	1
No	1
reasoning,	1
no	1
proof	1
has	1
establish'd	1
it,	1
Undeniable	1
growth	1
has	1
establish'd	1
it.	1
4	1
These	1
to	1
echo	1
the	1
tones	1
of	1
souls	1
and	1
the	1
phrases	1
of	1
souls,	1
(If	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
echo	1
the	1
phrases	1
of	1
souls	1
what	1
were	1
they	1
then?	1
If	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
reference	1
to	1
you	1
in	1
especial	1
what	1
were	1
they	1
then?)	1
I	1
swear	1
I	1
will	1
never	1
henceforth	1
have	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
the	1
faith	1
that	1
tells	1
the	1
best,	1
I	1
will	1
have	1
to	1
do	1
only	1
with	1
that	1
faith	1
that	1
leaves	1
the	1
best	1
untold.	1
Say	1
on,	1
sayers!	1
sing	1
on,	1
singers!	1
Delve!	1
mould!	1
pile	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
earth!	1
Work	1
on,	1
age	1
after	1
age,	1
nothing	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
lost,	1
It	1
may	1
have	1
to	1
wait	1
long,	1
but	1
it	1
will	1
certainly	1
come	1
in	1
use,	1
When	1
the	1
materials	1
are	1
all	1
prepared	1
and	1
ready,	1
the	1
architects	1
shall	1
appear.	1
I	1
swear	1
to	1
you	1
the	1
architects	1
shall	1
appear	1
without	1
fall,	1
I	1
swear	1

O	1

sing	1
such	1
grandeurs	1

glories	1
about	1

You	1
have	1

of	1

if	1
they	1
do	1
not	1
return	1
in	1
mockeries,	1
what	1
is	1
their	1

The	1

Underneath	1
them	1

lurk,	1

A	1

year	1
and	1

A	1
harsh	1
discordant	1
natal	1
scream	1
out-sounding,	1
to	1
touch	1
the	1
mother's	1
heart	1
closer	1
than	1
any	1
yet.	1
I	1
walk'd	1
the	1
shores	1
of	1
my	1
Eastern	1
sea,	1
Heard	1
over	1
the	1
waves	1
the	1
little	1
voice,	1
Saw	1
the	1
divine	1
infant	1
where	1
she	1
woke	1
mournfully	1
wailing,	1
amid	1
the	1
roar	1
of	1
cannon,	1
curses,	1
shouts,	1
crash	1
of	1
falling	1
buildings,	1
Was	1
not	1
so	1
sick	1
from	1
the	1
blood	1
in	1
the	1
gutters	1
running,	1
nor	1
from	1
the	1
single	1
corpses,	1
nor	1
those	1
in	1
heaps,	1
nor	1
those	1
borne	1
away	1
in	1
the	1
tumbrils,	1
Was	1
not	1
so	1
desperate	1
at	1
the	1
battues	1
of	1
death--was	1
not	1
so	1
shock'd	1
at	1
the	1
repeated	1
fusillades	1
of	1
the	1
guns.	1
Pale,	1
silent,	1
stern,	1
what	1
could	1
I	1
say	1
to	1
that	1
long-accrued	1
retribution?	1
Could	1
I	1
wish	1
humanity	1
different?	1
Could	1
I	1
wish	1
the	1
people	1
made	1
of	1
wood	1
and	1
stone?	1
Or	1
that	1
there	1
be	1
no	1
justice	1
in	1
destiny	1
or	1
time?	1
O	1
Liberty!	1
O	1
mate	1
for	1
me!	1
Here	1
too	1
the	1
blaze,	1
the	1
grape-shot	1
and	1
the	1
axe,	1
in	1
reserve,	1
to	1
fetch	1
them	1
out	1
in	1
case	1
of	1
need,	1
Here	1
too,	1
though	1
long	1
represt,	1
can	1
never	1
be	1
destroy'd,	1
Here	1
too	1
could	1
rise	1
at	1
last	1
murdering	1
and	1
ecstatic,	1
Here	1
too	1
demanding	1
full	1
arrears	1
of	1
vengeance.	1
Hence	1
I	1
sign	1
this	1
salute	1
over	1
the	1
sea,	1
And	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
deny	1
that	1
terrible	1
red	1
birth	1
and	1
baptism,	1
But	1
remember	1
the	1
little	1
voice	1
that	1
I	1
heard	1
wailing,	1
and	1
wait	1
with	1
perfect	1
trust,	1
no	1
matter	1
how	1
long,	1
And	1
from	1
to-day	1
sad	1
and	1
cogent	1
I	1
maintain	1
the	1
bequeath'd	1
cause,	1
as	1
for	1
all	1
lands,	1
And	1
I	1
send	1
these	1
words	1

Paris	1
with	1
my	1
love,	1
And	1
I	1
guess	1
some	1

For	1
I	1

there	1
is	1

they	1
will	1
soon	1
be	1
drowning	1
all	1
that	1
would	1
interrupt	1
them,	1
O	1
I	1
think	1
the	1
east	1
wind	1
brings	1
a	1
triumphal	1
and	1
free	1
march,	1
It	1
reaches	1
hither,	1
it	1
swells	1
me	1
to	1
Joyful	1
madness,	1
I	1
will	1
run	1
transpose	1
it	1
in	1

the	1
patches	1
of	1
briers	1
and	1
blackberries,	1
From	1
the	1
memories	1
of	1
the	1
bird	1
that	1
chanted	1
to	1
me,	1
From	1
your	1
memories	1
sad	1
brother,	1
from	1
the	1
fitful	1
risings	1
and	1
fallings	1
I	1
heard,	1
From	1
under	1
that	1
yellow	1
half-moon	1
late-risen	1
and	1
swollen	1
as	1
if	1
with	1
tears,	1
From	1
those	1
beginning	1
notes	1
of	1
yearning	1
and	1
love	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
mist,	1
From	1
the	1
thousand	1
responses	1
of	1
my	1
heart	1
never	1
to	1
cease,	1
From	1
the	1
myriad	1
thence-arous'd	1
words,	1
From	1
the	1
word	1
stronger	1
and	1
more	1
delicious	1
than	1
any,	1
From	1
such	1
as	1
now	1
they	1
start	1
the	1
scene	1
revisiting,	1
As	1
a	1
flock,	1
twittering,	1
rising,	1
or	1
overhead	1
passing,	1
Borne	1
hither,	1
ere	1
all	1
eludes	1
me,	1
hurriedly,	1
A	1
man,	1
yet	1
by	1
these	1
tears	1
a	1
little	1
boy	1
again,	1
Throwing	1
myself	1
on	1
the	1
sand,	1
confronting	1
the	1
waves,	1
I,	1
chanter	1
of	1
pains	1
and	1
joys,	1
uniter	1
of	1
here	1
and	1
hereafter,	1
Taking	1
all	1
hints	1
to	1
use	1
them,	1
but	1
swiftly	1
leaping	1
beyond	1
them,	1
A	1
reminiscence	1
sing.	1
Once	1
Paumanok,	1
When	1
the	1
lilac-scent	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
air	1
and	1
Fifth-month	1
grass	1
was	1
growing,	1
Up	1
this	1
seashore	1
in	1
some	1
briers,	1
Two	1
feather'd	1
guests	1
from	1
Alabama,	1
two	1
together,	1
And	1
their	1
nest,	1
and	1
four	1
light-green	1
eggs	1
spotted	1
with	1
brown,	1
And	1
every	1
day	1
the	1
he-bird	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
near	1
at	1
hand,	1
And	1
every	1
day	1
the	1
she-bird	1
crouch'd	1
on	1
her	1
nest,	1
silent,	1
with	1
bright	1
eyes,	1
And	1
every	1
day	1
I,	1
a	1
curious	1
boy,	1
never	1
too	1
close,	1
never	1
disturbing	1
them,	1
Cautiously	1
peering,	1
absorbing,	1
translating.	1
Shine!	1
shine!	1
shine!	1
Pour	1
down	1
your	1
warmth,	1
great	1
sun.'	1
While	1
we	1
bask,	1
we	1
two	1
together.	1
Two	1
together!	1
Winds	1
blow	1
south,	1
or	1
winds	1
blow	1
north,	1
Day	1
come	1
white,	1
or	1
night	1
come	1
black,	1
Home,	1
or	1
rivers	1
and	1
mountains	1
from	1
home,	1
Singing	1
all	1
time,	1
minding	1
no	1
time,	1
While	1
we	1
two	1
keep	1
together.	1
Till	1
of	1
a	1
sudden,	1
May-be	1
kill'd,	1
unknown	1
to	1
her	1
mate,	1
One	1
forenoon	1
the	1
she-bird	1
crouch'd	1
not	1
on	1
the	1
nest,	1
Nor	1
return'd	1
that	1
afternoon,	1
nor	1
the	1
next,	1
Nor	1
ever	1
appear'd	1
again.	1
And	1
thenceforward	1
all	1
summer	1
in	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
And	1
at	1
night	1
under	1
the	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
moon	1
in	1
calmer	1
weather,	1
Over	1
the	1
hoarse	1
surging	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
Or	1
flitting	1
from	1
brier	1
to	1
brier	1
by	1
day,	1
I	1
saw,	1
I	1
heard	1
at	1
intervals	1
the	1
remaining	1
one,	1
the	1
he-bird,	1
The	1
solitary	1
guest	1
from	1
Alabama.	1
Blow!	1
blow!	1
blow!	1
Blow	1
up	1
sea-winds	1
along	1
Paumanok's	1
shore;	1
I	1
wait	1
and	1
I	1
wait	1
till	1
you	1
blow	1
my	1
mate	1
to	1
me.	1
Yes,	1
when	1
the	1
stars	1
glisten'd,	1
All	1
night	1
long	1
on	1
the	1
prong	1
of	1
a	1
moss-scallop'd	1
stake,	1
Down	1
almost	1
amid	1
the	1
slapping	1
waves,	1
Sat	1
the	1
lone	1
singer	1
wonderful	1
causing	1
tears.	1
He	1
call'd	1
on	1
his	1
mate,	1
He	1
pour'd	1
forth	1
the	1
meanings	1
which	1
I	1
of	1
all	1
men	1
know.	1
Yes	1
my	1
brother	1
I	1
know,	1
The	1
rest	1
might	1
not,	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
treasur'd	1
every	1
note,	1
For	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
dimly	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
beach	1
gliding,	1
Silent,	1
avoiding	1
the	1
moonbeams,	1
blending	1
myself	1
with	1
the	1
shadows,	1
Recalling	1
now	1
the	1
obscure	1
shapes,	1
the	1
echoes,	1
the	1
sounds	1
and	1
sights	1
after	1
their	1
sorts,	1
The	1
white	1
arms	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
breakers	1
tirelessly	1
tossing,	1
I,	1
with	1
bare	1
feet,	1
a	1
child,	1
the	1
wind	1
wafting	1
my	1
hair,	1
Listen'd	1
long	1
and	1
long.	1
Listen'd	1
to	1
keep,	1
to	1
sing,	1
now	1
translating	1
the	1
notes,	1
Following	1
you	1
my	1
brother.	1
Soothe!	1
soothe!	1
soothe!	1
Close	1
on	1
its	1
wave	1
soothes	1
the	1
wave	1
behind,	1
And	1
again	1
another	1
behind	1
embracing	1
and	1
lapping,	1
every	1
one	1
close,	1
But	1
my	1
love	1
soothes	1
not	1
me,	1
not	1
me.	1
Low	1
hangs	1
the	1
moon,	1
it	1
rose	1
late,	1
It	1
is	1
lagging--O	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
is	1
heavy	1
with	1
love,	1
with	1
love.	1
O	1
madly	1
the	1
sea	1
pushes	1
upon	1
the	1
land,	1
With	1
love,	1
with	1
love.	1
O	1
night!	1
do	1
I	1
not	1
see	1
my	1
love	1
fluttering	1
out	1
among	1
the	1
breakers?	1
What	1
is	1
that	1
little	1
black	1
thing	1
I	1
see	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
white?	1
Loud!	1
loud!	1
loud!	1
Loud	1
I	1
call	1
to	1
you,	1
my	1
love!	1
High	1
and	1
clear	1
I	1
shoot	1
my	1
voice	1
over	1
the	1
waves,	1
Surely	1
you	1
must	1
know	1
who	1
is	1
here,	1
is	1
here,	1
You	1
must	1
know	1
who	1
I	1
am,	1
my	1
love.	1
Low-hanging	1
moon!	1
What	1
is	1
that	1
dusky	1
spot	1
in	1
your	1
brown	1
yellow?	1
O	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
shape,	1
the	1
shape	1
of	1
my	1
mate.'	1
O	1
moon	1
do	1
not	1
keep	1
her	1
from	1
me	1
any	1
longer.	1
Land!	1
land!	1
O	1
land!	1
Whichever	1
way	1
I	1
turn,	1
O	1
I	1
think	1
you	1
could	1
give	1
me	1
my	1
mate	1
back	1
again	1
if	1
you	1
only	1
would,	1
For	1
I	1
am	1
almost	1
sure	1
I	1
see	1
her	1
dimly	1
whichever	1
way	1
I	1
look.	1
O	1
rising	1
stars!	1
Perhaps	1
the	1
one	1
I	1
want	1
so	1
much	1
will	1
rise,	1
will	1
rise	1
with	1
some	1
of	1
you.	1
O	1
throat!	1
O	1
trembling	1
throat!	1
Sound	1
clearer	1
through	1
the	1
atmosphere!	1
Pierce	1
the	1
woods,	1
the	1
earth,	1
Somewhere	1
listening	1
to	1
catch	1
you	1
must	1
be	1
the	1
one	1
I	1
want.	1
Shake	1
out	1
carols!	1
Solitary	1
here,	1
the	1
night's	1
carols!	1
Carols	1
of	1
lonesome	1
love!	1
death's	1
carols!	1
Carols	1
under	1
that	1
lagging,	1
yellow,	1
waning	1
moon!	1
O	1
under	1
that	1
moon	1
where	1
she	1
droops	1
almost	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
sea!	1
O	1
reckless	1
despairing	1
carols.	1
But	1
soft!	1
sink	1
low!	1
Soft!	1
let	1
me	1
just	1
murmur,	1
And	1
do	1
you	1
wait	1
a	1
moment	1
you	1
husky-nois'd	1
sea,	1
For	1
somewhere	1
I	1
believe	1
I	1
heard	1
my	1
mate	1
responding	1
to	1
me,	1
So	1
faint,	1
I	1
must	1
be	1
still,	1
be	1
still	1
to	1
listen,	1
But	1
not	1
altogether	1
still,	1
for	1
then	1
she	1
might	1
not	1
come	1
immediately	1
to	1
me.	1
Hither	1
my	1
love!	1
Here	1
I	1
am!	1
here!	1
With	1
this	1
just-sustain'd	1
note	1
I	1
announce	1
myself	1
to	1
you,	1
This	1
gentle	1
call	1
is	1
for	1
you	1
my	1
love,	1
for	1
you.	1
Do	1
not	1
be	1
decoy'd	1
elsewhere,	1
That	1
is	1
the	1
whistle	1
of	1
the	1
wind,	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
my	1
voice,	1
That	1
is	1
the	1
fluttering,	1
the	1
fluttering	1
of	1
the	1
spray,	1
Those	1
are	1
the	1
shadows	1
of	1
leaves.	1
O	1
darkness!	1
O	1
in	1
vain!	1
O	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
sick	1
and	1
sorrowful	1
O	1
brown	1
halo	1
in	1
the	1
sky	1
near	1
the	1
moon,	1
drooping	1
upon	1
the	1
sea!	1
O	1
troubled	1
reflection	1
in	1
the	1
sea!	1
O	1
throat!	1
O	1
throbbing	1
heart!	1
And	1
I	1
singing	1
uselessly,	1
uselessly	1
all	1
the	1
night.	1
O	1
past!	1
O	1
happy	1
life!	1
O	1
songs	1
of	1
joy!	1
In	1
the	1
air,	1
in	1
the	1
woods,	1
over	1
fields,	1
Loved!	1
loved!	1
loved!	1
loved!	1
loved!	1
But	1
my	1
mate	1
no	1
more,	1
no	1
more	1
with	1
me!	1
We	1
two	1
together	1
no	1
more.	1
The	1
aria	1
sinking,	1
All	1
else	1
continuing,	1
the	1
stars	1
shining,	1
The	1
winds	1
blowing,	1
the	1
notes	1
of	1
the	1
bird	1
continuous	1
echoing,	1
With	1
angry	1
moans	1
the	1
fierce	1
old	1
mother	1
incessantly	1
moaning,	1
On	1
the	1
sands	1
of	1
Paumanok's	1
shore	1
gray	1
and	1
rustling,	1
The	1
yellow	1
half-moon	1
enlarged,	1
sagging	1
down,	1
drooping,	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
almost	1
touching,	1
The	1
boy	1
ecstatic,	1
with	1
his	1
bare	1
feet	1
the	1
waves,	1
with	1
his	1
hair	1
the	1
atmosphere	1
dallying,	1
The	1
love	1
in	1
the	1
heart	1
long	1
pent,	1
now	1
loose,	1
now	1
at	1
last	1
tumultuously	1
bursting,	1
The	1
aria's	1
meaning,	1
the	1
ears,	1
the	1
soul,	1
swiftly	1
depositing,	1
The	1
strange	1
tears	1
down	1
the	1
cheeks	1
coursing,	1
The	1
colloquy	1
there,	1
the	1
trio,	1
each	1
uttering,	1
The	1
undertone,	1
the	1
savage	1
old	1
mother	1
incessantly	1
crying,	1
To	1
the	1
boy's	1
soul's	1
questions	1
sullenly	1
timing,	1
some	1
drown'd	1
secret	1
hissing,	1
To	1
the	1
outsetting	1
bard.	1
Demon	1
or	1
bird!	1
(said	1
the	1
boy's	1
soul,)	1
Is	1
it	1
indeed	1
toward	1
your	1
mate	1
you	1
sing?	1
or	1
is	1
it	1
really	1
to	1
me?	1
For	1
I,	1
that	1
was	1
a	1
child,	1
my	1
tongue's	1
use	1
sleeping,	1
now	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
you,	1
Now	1
in	1
a	1
moment	1
I	1
know	1
what	1
I	1
am	1
for,	1
I	1
awake,	1
And	1
already	1
a	1
thousand	1
singers,	1
a	1
thousand	1
songs,	1
clearer,	1
louder	1
and	1
more	1
sorrowful	1
than	1
yours,	1
A	1
thousand	1
warbling	1
echoes	1
have	1
started	1
to	1
life	1
within	1
me,	1
never	1
to	1
die.	1
O	1
you	1
singer	1
solitary,	1
singing	1
by	1
yourself,	1
projecting	1
me,	1
O	1
solitary	1
me	1
listening,	1
never	1
more	1
shall	1
I	1
cease	1
perpetuating	1
you,	1
Never	1
more	1
shall	1
I	1
escape,	1
never	1
more	1
the	1
reverberations,	1
Never	1
more	1
the	1
cries	1
of	1
unsatisfied	1
love	1
be	1
absent	1
from	1
me,	1
Never	1
again	1
leave	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
peaceful	1
child	1
I	1
was	1
before	1
what	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
night,	1
By	1
the	1
sea	1
under	1
the	1
yellow	1
and	1
sagging	1
moon,	1
The	1
messenger	1
there	1
arous'd,	1
the	1
fire,	1
the	1
sweet	1
hell	1
within,	1
The	1
unknown	1
want,	1
the	1
destiny	1
of	1
me.	1
O	1
give	1
me	1
the	1
clue!	1
(it	1
lurks	1
in	1
the	1
night	1
here	1
somewhere,)	1
O	1
if	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
have	1
so	1
much,	1
let	1
me	1
have	1
more!	1
A	1
word	1
then,	1
(for	1
I	1
will	1
conquer	1
it,)	1
The	1
word	1
final,	1
superior	1
to	1
all,	1
Subtle,	1
sent	1
up--what	1
is	1
it?--I	1
listen;	1
Are	1
you	1
whispering	1
it,	1
and	1
have	1
been	1
all	1
the	1
time,	1
you	1
sea-waves?	1
Is	1
that	1
it	1
from	1
your	1
liquid	1
rims	1
and	1
wet	1
sands?	1
Whereto	1
answering,	1
the	1
sea,	1
Delaying	1
not,	1
hurrying	1
not,	1
Whisper'd	1
me	1
through	1
the	1
night,	1
and	1
very	1
plainly	1
before	1
daybreak,	1
Lisp'd	1
to	1
me	1
the	1
low	1
and	1
delicious	1
word	1
death,	1
And	1
again	1
death,	1
death,	1
death,	1
death	1
Hissing	1
melodious,	1
neither	1
like	1
the	1
bird	1
nor	1
like	1
my	1
arous'd	1
child's	1
heart,	1
But	1
edging	1
near	1
as	1
privately	1
for	1
me	1
rustling	1
at	1
my	1
feet,	1
Creeping	1
thence	1
steadily	1
up	1
to	1
my	1
ears	1
and	1
laving	1
me	1
softly	1
all	1
over,	1
Death,	1
death,	1
death,	1
death,	1
death.	1
Which	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
forget.	1
But	1
fuse	1
the	1
song	1
of	1
my	1
dusky	1
demon	1
and	1
brother,	1
That	1
he	1
sang	1
to	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
moonlight	1
on	1
Paumanok's	1
gray	1
beach,	1
With	1
the	1
thousand	1
responsive	1
songs	1
at	1
random,	1
My	1
own	1
songs	1
awaked	1
from	1
that	1
hour,	1
And	1
with	1
them	1
the	1
key,	1
the	1
word	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
waves,	1
The	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
sweetest	1
song	1
and	1
all	1
songs,	1
That	1
strong	1
and	1
delicious	1
word	1
which,	1
creeping	1
to	1
my	1
feet,	1
(Or	1
like	1
some	1
old	1
crone	1
rocking	1
the	1
cradle,	1
swathed	1
in	1
sweet	1
garments,	1
bending	1
aside,)	1
The	1
sea	1
whisper'd	1
me.	1
}	1
As	1
I	1
Ebb'd	1
with	1
the	1
Ocean	1
of	1
Life	1
1	1
As	1
I	1
ebb'd	1
with	1
the	1
ocean	1
of	1
life,	1
As	1
I	1
wended	1
the	1
shores	1
I	1
know,	1
As	1
I	1
walk'd	1
where	1
the	1
ripples	1
continually	1
wash	1
you	1
Paumanok,	1
Where	1
they	1
rustle	1
up	1
hoarse	1
and	1
sibilant,	1
Where	1
the	1
fierce	1
old	1
mother	1
endlessly	1
cries	1
for	1
her	1
castaways,	1
I	1
musing	1
late	1
in	1
the	1
autumn	1
day,	1
gazing	1
off	1
southward,	1
Held	1
by	1
this	1
electric	1
self	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
pride	1
of	1
which	1
I	1
utter	1
poems,	1
Was	1
seiz'd	1
by	1
the	1
spirit	1
that	1
trails	1
in	1
the	1
lines	1
underfoot,	1
The	1
rim,	1
the	1
sediment	1
that	1
stands	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
water	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
globe.	1
Fascinated,	1
my	1
eyes	1
reverting	1
from	1
the	1
south,	1
dropt,	1
to	1
follow	1
those	1
slender	1
windrows,	1
Chaff,	1
straw,	1
splinters	1
of	1
wood,	1
weeds,	1
and	1
the	1
sea-gluten,	1
Scum,	1
scales	1
from	1
shining	1
rocks,	1
leaves	1
of	1
salt-lettuce,	1
left	1
by	1
the	1
tide,	1
Miles	1
walking,	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
breaking	1
waves	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
me,	1
Paumanok	1
there	1
and	1
then	1
as	1
I	1
thought	1
the	1
old	1
thought	1
of	1
likenesses,	1
These	1
you	1
presented	1
to	1
me	1
you	1
fish-shaped	1
island,	1
As	1
I	1
wended	1
the	1
shores	1
I	1
know,	1
As	1
I	1
walk'd	1
with	1
that	1
electric	1
self	1
seeking	1
types.	1
2	1
As	1
I	1
wend	1
to	1
the	1
shores	1
I	1
know	1
not,	1
As	1
I	1
list	1
to	1
the	1
dirge,	1
the	1
voices	1
of	1
men	1
and	1
women	1
wreck'd,	1
As	1
I	1
inhale	1
the	1
impalpable	1
breezes	1
that	1
set	1
in	1
upon	1
me,	1
As	1
the	1
ocean	1
so	1
mysterious	1
rolls	1
toward	1
me	1
closer	1
and	1
closer,	1
I	1
too	1
but	1
signify	1
at	1
the	1
utmost	1
a	1
little	1
wash'd-up	1
drift,	1
A	1
few	1
sands	1
and	1
dead	1
leaves	1
to	1
gather,	1
Gather,	1
and	1
merge	1
myself	1
as	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
sands	1
and	1
drift.	1
O	1
baffled,	1
balk'd,	1
bent	1
to	1
the	1
very	1
earth,	1
Oppress'd	1
with	1
myself	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
dared	1
to	1
open	1
my	1
mouth,	1
Aware	1
now	1
that	1
amid	1
all	1
that	1
blab	1
whose	1
echoes	1
recoil	1
upon	1
me	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
once	1
had	1
the	1
least	1
idea	1
who	1
or	1
what	1
I	1
am,	1
But	1
that	1
before	1
all	1
my	1
arrogant	1
poems	1
the	1
real	1
Me	1
stands	1
yet	1
untouch'd,	1
untold,	1
altogether	1
unreach'd,	1
Withdrawn	1
far,	1
mocking	1
me	1
with	1
mock-congratulatory	1
signs	1
and	1
bows,	1
With	1
peals	1
of	1
distant	1
ironical	1
laughter	1
at	1
every	1
word	1
I	1
have	1
written,	1
Pointing	1
in	1
silence	1
to	1
these	1
songs,	1
and	1
then	1
to	1
the	1
sand	1
beneath.	1
I	1
perceive	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
really	1
understood	1
any	1
thing,	1
not	1
a	1
single	1
object,	1
and	1
that	1
no	1
man	1
ever	1
can,	1
Nature	1
here	1
in	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
taking	1
advantage	1
of	1
me	1
to	1
dart	1
upon	1
me	1
and	1
sting	1
me,	1
Because	1
I	1
have	1
dared	1
to	1
open	1
my	1
mouth	1
to	1
sing	1
at	1
all.	1

You	1
oceans	1
both,	1
I	1
close	1
with	1
you,	1
We	1
murmur	1
alike	1
reproachfully	1
rolling	1
sands	1

drift,	1
knowing	1
not	1
why,	1
These	1
little	1
shreds	1
indeed	1
standing	1

you	1

bubbled	1
up,	1
floated	1
the	1
measureless	1

been	1
wash'd	1
on	1
your	1

I	1

am	1

upon	1
your	1

I	1
hold	1
you	1

firm	1
till	1

something.	1
Kiss	1

Touch	1

Breathe	1

A	1
Boston	1
Ballad	1
[1854]	1
To	1
get	1
betimes	1
in	1
Boston	1
town	1
I	1
rose	1
this	1
morning	1
early,	1
Here's	1
a	1
good	1
place	1
at	1
the	1
corner,	1
I	1
must	1
stand	1
and	1
see	1
the	1
show.	1
Clear	1
the	1
way	1
there	1
Jonathan!	1
Way	1
for	1
the	1
President's	1
marshal--way	1
for	1
the	1
government	1
cannon!	1
Way	1
for	1
the	1
Federal	1
foot	1
and	1
dragoons,	1
(and	1
the	1
apparitions	1
copiously	1
tumbling.)	1
I	1
love	1
to	1
look	1
on	1
the	1
Stars	1
and	1
Stripes,	1
I	1
hope	1
the	1
fifes	1
will	1
play	1
Yankee	1
Doodle.	1
How	1
bright	1
shine	1
the	1
cutlasses	1
of	1
the	1
foremost	1
troops!	1
Every	1
man	1
holds	1
his	1
revolver,	1
marching	1
stiff	1
through	1
Boston	1
town.	1
A	1
fog	1
follows,	1
antiques	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
come	1
limping,	1
Some	1
appear	1
wooden-legged,	1
and	1
some	1
appear	1
bandaged	1
and	1
bloodless.	1
Why	1
this	1
is	1
indeed	1
a	1
show--it	1
has	1
called	1
the	1
dead	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
earth!	1
The	1
old	1
graveyards	1
of	1
the	1
hills	1
have	1
hurried	1
to	1
see!	1
Phantoms!	1
phantoms	1
countless	1
by	1
flank	1
and	1
rear!	1
Cock'd	1
hats	1
of	1
mothy	1
mould--crutches	1
made	1
of	1
mist!	1
Arms	1
in	1
slings--old	1
men	1
leaning	1
on	1
young	1
men's	1
shoulders.	1
What	1
troubles	1
you	1
Yankee	1
phantoms?	1
what	1
is	1
all	1
this	1
chattering	1
of	1
bare	1
gums?	1
Does	1
the	1
ague	1
convulse	1
your	1
limbs?	1
do	1
you	1
mistake	1
your	1
crutches	1
for	1
firelocks	1
and	1
level	1
them?	1
If	1
you	1
blind	1
your	1
eyes	1
with	1
tears	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
see	1
the	1
President's	1
marshal,	1
If	1
you	1
groan	1
such	1
groans	1
you	1
might	1
balk	1
the	1
government	1
cannon.	1
For	1
shame	1
old	1
maniacs--bring	1
down	1
those	1
toss'd	1
arms,	1
and	1
let	1
your	1
white	1
hair	1
be,	1
Here	1
gape	1
your	1
great	1
grandsons,	1
their	1
wives	1
gaze	1
at	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
windows,	1
See	1
how	1
well	1
dress'd,	1
see	1
how	1
orderly	1
they	1
conduct	1
themselves.	1
Worse	1
and	1
worse--can't	1
you	1
stand	1
it?	1
are	1
you	1
retreating?	1
Is	1
this	1
hour	1
with	1
the	1
living	1
too	1
dead	1
for	1
you?	1
Retreat	1
then--pell-mell!	1
To	1
your	1
graves--back--back	1
to	1
the	1
hills	1
old	1
limpers!	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
you	1
belong	1
here	1
anyhow.	1
But	1
there	1
is	1
one	1
thing	1
that	1
belongs	1
here--shall	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
what	1
it	1
is,	1
gentlemen	1
of	1
Boston?	1
I	1
will	1
whisper	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
Mayor,	1
he	1
shall	1
send	1
a	1
committee	1
to	1
England,	1
They	1
shall	1
get	1
a	1
grant	1
from	1
the	1
Parliament,	1
go	1
with	1
a	1
cart	1
to	1
the	1
royal	1
vault,	1
Dig	1
out	1
King	1
George's	1
coffin,	1
unwrap	1
him	1
quick	1
from	1
the	1
graveclothes,	1
box	1
up	1
his	1
bones	1
for	1
a	1
journey,	1
Find	1
a	1
swift	1
Yankee	1
clipper--here	1
is	1
freight	1
for	1
you,	1
black-bellied	1
clipper,	1
Up	1
with	1
your	1
anchor--shake	1
out	1
your	1
sails--steer	1
straight	1
toward	1
Boston	1
bay.	1
Now	1
call	1
for	1
the	1
President's	1
marshal	1
again,	1
bring	1
out	1
the	1
government	1
cannon,	1
Fetch	1
home	1
the	1
roarers	1
from	1
Congress,	1
make	1
another	1
procession,	1
guard	1
it	1
with	1
foot	1
and	1
dragoons.	1
This	1
centre-piece	1
for	1
them;	1
Look,	1
all	1
orderly	1
citizens--look	1
from	1
the	1
windows,	1
women!	1
The	1
committee	1
open	1
the	1
box,	1
set	1
up	1
the	1
regal	1
ribs,	1
glue	1
those	1
that	1
will	1
not	1
stay,	1
Clap	1
the	1
skull	1
on	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
ribs,	1
and	1
clap	1
a	1
crown	1
on	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
skull.	1
You	1
have	1
got	1
your	1
revenge,	1
old	1
buster--the	1
crown	1
is	1
come	1
to	1
its	1
own,	1
and	1
more	1
than	1
its	1
own.	1
Stick	1
your	1
hands	1
in	1
your	1
pockets,	1
Jonathan--you	1
are	1
a	1
made	1
man	1
from	1
this	1

Like	1

O	1

O	1

Turn	1

make	1
yourselves	1

And	1
you,	1

People--you	1
liars,	1
mark!	1
Not	1
for	1
numberless	1
agonies,	1
murders,	1
lusts,	1
For	1
court	1
thieving	1
in	1
its	1
manifold	1
mean	1
forms,	1
worming	1
from	1
his	1
simplicity	1
the	1
poor	1
man's	1
wages,	1
For	1
many	1
a	1
promise	1
sworn	1
by	1
royal	1
lips	1
and	1
broken	1

did	1

Soldier,	1

sycophant.	1
Yet	1

all	1
lowering	1
stealing,	1
lo,	1
a	1
shape,	1
Vague	1
as	1
the	1
night,	1
draped	1
interminably,	1
head,	1
front	1
and	1
form,	1
in	1
scarlet	1
folds,	1
Whose	1
face	1
and	1
eyes	1
none	1

Out	1
of	1
its	1
robes	1
only	1
this,	1
the	1
red	1
robes	1
lifted	1
by	1
the	1
arm,	1
One	1
finger	1
crook'd	1
pointed	1
high	1
over	1
the	1
top,	1
like	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
a	1
snake	1
appears.	1
Meanwhile	1
corpses	1
lie	1
in	1
new-made	1
graves,	1
bloody	1
corpses	1
of	1
young	1
men,	1
The	1
rope	1
of	1
the	1
gibbet	1
hangs	1
heavily,	1
the	1
bullets	1
of	1
princes	1

flying,	1
the	1
creatures	1
of	1
power	1

aloud,	1
And	1
all	1
these	1
things	1

fruits,	1
and	1
they	1

Those	1
corpses	1
of	1
young	1
men,	1
Those	1
martyrs	1
that	1
hang	1
from	1
the	1
gibbets,	1
those	1
hearts	1
pierc'd	1
by	1
the	1
gray	1
lead,	1
Cold	1
and	1
motionless	1
as	1
they	1
seem	1
live	1
elsewhere	1
with	1
unslaughter'd	1
vitality.	1
They	1
live	1
in	1
other	1
young	1
men	1
O	1
kings!	1
They	1
live	1
in	1
brothers	1
again	1
ready	1
to	1
defy	1
you,	1
They	1
were	1
purified	1
by	1
death,	1
they	1
were	1
taught	1
and	1
exalted.	1
Not	1
a	1
grave	1
of	1
the	1
murder'd	1
for	1
freedom	1
but	1
grows	1
seed	1
for	1
freedom,	1

Which	1

far	1
into	1
the	1
future,	1
Crying	1
with	1
trumpet	1
voice,	1
Arouse	1
and	1
beware!	1
Beware	1
and	1
arouse!)	1
I'll	1
pour	1
the	1
verse	1
with	1
streams	1
of	1
blood,	1
full	1
of	1
volition,	1
full	1
of	1
joy,	1
Then	1
loosen,	1
launch	1
forth,	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
compete,	1
With	1
the	1
banner	1
and	1
pennant	1
a-flapping.	1
Pennant:	1
Come	1
up	1
here,	1
bard,	1
bard,	1
Come	1
up	1
here,	1
soul,	1
soul,	1
Come	1
up	1
here,	1
dear	1
little	1
child,	1
To	1
fly	1
in	1
the	1
clouds	1
and	1
winds	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
play	1
with	1
the	1
measureless	1
light.	1
Child:	1
Father	1
what	1
is	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
sky	1
beckoning	1
to	1
me	1
with	1
long	1
finger?	1
And	1
what	1
does	1
it	1
say	1
to	1
me	1
all	1
the	1
while?	1
Father:	1
Nothing	1
my	1
babe	1
you	1
see	1
in	1
the	1
sky,	1
And	1
nothing	1
at	1
all	1
to	1
you	1
it	1
says--but	1
look	1
you	1
my	1
babe,	1
Look	1
at	1
these	1
dazzling	1
things	1
in	1
the	1
houses,	1
and	1
see	1
you	1
the	1
money-	1
shops	1
opening,	1
And	1
see	1
you	1
the	1
vehicles	1
preparing	1
to	1
crawl	1
along	1
the	1
streets	1
with	1
goods;	1
These,	1
ah	1
these,	1
how	1
valued	1
and	1
toil'd	1
for	1
these!	1
How	1
envied	1
by	1
all	1
the	1
earth.	1
Poet:	1
Fresh	1
and	1
rosy	1
red	1
the	1
sun	1
is	1
mounting	1
high,	1
On	1
floats	1
the	1
sea	1
in	1
distant	1
blue	1
careering	1
through	1
its	1
channels,	1
On	1
floats	1
the	1
wind	1
over	1
the	1
breast	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
setting	1
in	1
toward	1
land,	1
The	1
great	1
steady	1
wind	1
from	1
west	1
or	1
west-by-south,	1
Floating	1
so	1
buoyant	1
with	1
milk-white	1
foam	1
on	1
the	1
waters.	1
But	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
the	1
sea	1
nor	1
the	1
red	1
sun,	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
the	1
wind	1
with	1
girlish	1
laughter,	1
Not	1
the	1
immense	1
wind	1
which	1
strengthens,	1
not	1
the	1
wind	1
which	1
lashes,	1
Not	1
the	1
spirit	1
that	1
ever	1
lashes	1
its	1
own	1
body	1
to	1
terror	1
and	1
death,	1
But	1
I	1
am	1
that	1
which	1
unseen	1
comes	1
and	1
sings,	1
sings,	1
sings,	1
Which	1
babbles	1
in	1
brooks	1
and	1
scoots	1
in	1
showers	1
on	1
the	1
land,	1
Which	1
the	1
birds	1
know	1
in	1
the	1
woods	1
mornings	1
and	1
evenings,	1
And	1
the	1
shore-sands	1
know	1
and	1
the	1
hissing	1
wave,	1
and	1
that	1
banner	1
and	1
pennant,	1
Aloft	1
there	1
flapping	1
and	1
flapping.	1
Child:	1
O	1
father	1
it	1
is	1
alive--it	1
is	1
full	1
of	1
people--it	1
has	1
children,	1
O	1
now	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
it	1
is	1
talking	1
to	1
its	1
children,	1
I	1
hear	1
it--it	1
talks	1
to	1
me--O	1
it	1
is	1
wonderful!	1
O	1
it	1
stretches--it	1
spreads	1
and	1
runs	1
so	1
fast--O	1
my	1
father,	1
It	1
is	1
so	1
broad	1
it	1
covers	1
the	1
whole	1
sky.	1
Father:	1
Cease,	1
cease,	1
my	1
foolish	1
babe,	1
What	1
you	1
are	1
saying	1
is	1
sorrowful	1
to	1
me,	1
much	1
't	1
displeases	1
me;	1
Behold	1
with	1
the	1
rest	1
again	1
I	1
say,	1
behold	1
not	1
banners	1
and	1
pennants	1
aloft,	1
But	1
the	1
well-prepared	1
pavements	1
behold,	1
and	1
mark	1
the	1
solid-wall'd	1
houses.	1
Banner	1
and	1
Pennant:	1
Speak	1
to	1
the	1
child	1
O	1
bard	1
out	1
of	1
Manhattan,	1
To	1
our	1
children	1
all,	1
or	1
north	1
or	1
south	1
of	1
Manhattan,	1
Point	1
this	1
day,	1
leaving	1
all	1
the	1
rest,	1
to	1
us	1
over	1
all--and	1
yet	1
we	1
know	1
not	1
why,	1
For	1
what	1
are	1
we,	1
mere	1
strips	1
of	1
cloth	1
profiting	1
nothing,	1
Only	1
flapping	1
in	1
the	1
wind?	1
Poet:	1
I	1
hear	1
and	1
see	1
not	1
strips	1
of	1
cloth	1
alone,	1
I	1
hear	1
the	1
tramp	1
of	1
armies,	1
I	1
hear	1
the	1
challenging	1
sentry,	1
I	1
hear	1
the	1
jubilant	1
shouts	1
of	1
millions	1
of	1
men,	1
I	1
hear	1
Liberty!	1
I	1
hear	1
the	1
drums	1
beat	1
and	1
the	1
trumpets	1
blowing,	1
I	1
myself	1
move	1
abroad	1
swift-rising	1
flying	1
then,	1
I	1
use	1
the	1
wings	1
of	1
the	1
land-bird	1
and	1
use	1
the	1
wings	1
of	1
the	1
sea-bird,	1
and	1
look	1
down	1
as	1
from	1
a	1
height,	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
deny	1
the	1
precious	1
results	1
of	1
peace,	1
I	1
see	1
populous	1
cities	1
with	1
wealth	1
incalculable,	1
I	1
see	1
numberless	1
farms,	1
I	1
see	1
the	1
farmers	1
working	1
in	1
their	1
fields	1
or	1
barns,	1
I	1
see	1
mechanics	1
working,	1
I	1
see	1
buildings	1
everywhere	1
founded,	1
going	1
up,	1
or	1
finish'd,	1
I	1
see	1
trains	1
of	1
cars	1
swiftly	1
speeding	1
along	1
railroad	1
tracks	1
drawn	1
by	1
the	1
locomotives,	1
I	1
see	1
the	1
stores,	1
depots,	1
of	1
Boston,	1
Baltimore,	1
Charleston,	1
New	1
Orleans,	1
I	1
see	1
far	1
in	1
the	1
West	1
the	1
immense	1
area	1
of	1
grain,	1
I	1
dwell	1
awhile	1
hovering,	1
I	1
pass	1
to	1
the	1
lumber	1
forests	1
of	1
the	1
North,	1
and	1
again	1
to	1
the	1
Southern	1
plantation,	1
and	1
again	1
to	1
California;	1
Sweeping	1
the	1
whole	1
I	1
see	1
the	1
countless	1
profit,	1
the	1
busy	1
gatherings,	1
earn'd	1
wages,	1
See	1
the	1
Identity	1
formed	1
out	1
of	1
thirty-eight	1
spacious	1
and	1
haughty	1
States,	1
(and	1
many	1
more	1
to	1
come,)	1
See	1
forts	1
on	1
the	1
shores	1
of	1
harbors,	1
see	1
ships	1
sailing	1
in	1
and	1
out;	1
Then	1
over	1
all,	1
(aye!	1
aye!)	1
my	1
little	1
and	1
lengthen'd	1
pennant	1
shaped	1
like	1
a	1
sword,	1
Runs	1
swiftly	1
up	1
indicating	1
war	1
and	1
defiance--and	1
now	1
the	1
halyards	1
have	1
rais'd	1
it,	1
Side	1
of	1
my	1
banner	1
broad	1
and	1
blue,	1
side	1
of	1
my	1
starry	1
banner,	1
Discarding	1
peace	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
sea	1
and	1
land.	1
Banner	1
and	1
Pennant:	1
Yet	1
louder,	1
higher,	1
stronger,	1
bard!	1
yet	1
farther,	1
wider	1
cleave!	1
No	1
longer	1
let	1
our	1
children	1
deem	1
us	1
riches	1
and	1
peace	1
alone,	1
We	1
may	1
be	1
terror	1
and	1
carnage,	1
and	1
are	1
so	1
now,	1
Not	1
now	1
are	1
we	1
any	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
spacious	1
and	1
haughty	1
States,	1
(nor	1
any	1
five,	1
nor	1
ten,)	1
Nor	1
market	1
nor	1
depot	1
we,	1
nor	1
money-bank	1
in	1
the	1
city,	1
But	1
these	1
and	1
all,	1
and	1
the	1
brown	1
and	1
spreading	1
land,	1
and	1
the	1
mines	1
below,	1
are	1
ours,	1
And	1
the	1
shores	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
are	1
ours,	1
and	1
the	1
rivers	1
great	1
and	1
small,	1
And	1
the	1
fields	1
they	1
moisten,	1
and	1
the	1
crops	1
and	1
the	1
fruits	1
are	1
ours,	1
Bays	1
and	1
channels	1
and	1
ships	1
sailing	1
in	1
and	1
out	1
are	1
ours--while	1
we	1
over	1
all,	1
Over	1
the	1
area	1
spread	1
below,	1
the	1
three	1
or	1
four	1
millions	1
of	1
square	1
miles,	1
the	1

The	1
forty	1
millions	1
of	1
people,--O	1
bard!	1
in	1
life	1
and	1
death	1
supreme,	1
We,	1
even	1
we,	1
henceforth	1
flaunt	1
out	1
masterful,	1
high	1
up	1
above,	1
Not	1
for	1
the	1
present	1
alone,	1
for	1
a	1
thousand	1
years	1
chanting	1
through	1
you,	1
This	1
song	1
to	1
the	1
soul	1
of	1
one	1
poor	1
little	1
child.	1
Child:	1
O	1
my	1
father	1
I	1
like	1
not	1
the	1
houses,	1
They	1
will	1
never	1
to	1
me	1
be	1
any	1
thing,	1
nor	1
do	1
I	1
like	1
money,	1
But	1
to	1
mount	1
up	1
there	1
I	1
would	1
like,	1
O	1
father	1
dear,	1
that	1
banner	1
I	1
like,	1
That	1
pennant	1
I	1
would	1
be	1
and	1
must	1
be.	1
Father:	1
Child	1
of	1
mine	1
you	1
fill	1
me	1
with	1
anguish,	1
To	1
be	1
that	1
pennant	1
would	1
be	1
too	1
fearful,	1
Little	1
you	1
know	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
this	1
day,	1
and	1
after	1
this	1
day,	1
forever,	1
It	1
is	1
to	1
gain	1
nothing,	1
but	1
risk	1
and	1
defy	1
every	1
thing,	1
Forward	1
to	1
stand	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
wars--and	1
O,	1
such	1
wars!--what	1
have	1
you	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
them?	1
With	1
passions	1
of	1
demons,	1
slaughter,	1
premature	1
death?	1
Banner:	1
Demons	1
and	1
death	1
then	1
I	1
sing,	1
Put	1
in	1
all,	1
aye	1
all	1
will	1
I,	1
sword-shaped	1
pennant	1
for	1
war,	1
And	1
a	1
pleasure	1
new	1
and	1
ecstatic,	1
and	1
the	1
prattled	1
yearning	1
of	1
children,	1
Blent	1
with	1
the	1
sounds	1
of	1
the	1
peaceful	1
land	1
and	1
the	1
liquid	1
wash	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
And	1
the	1
black	1
ships	1
fighting	1
on	1
the	1
sea	1
envelop'd	1
in	1
smoke,	1
And	1
the	1
icy	1
cool	1
of	1
the	1
far,	1
far	1
north,	1
with	1
rustling	1
cedars	1
and	1
pines,	1
And	1
the	1
whirr	1
of	1
drums	1
and	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
soldiers	1
marching,	1
and	1
the	1
hot	1
sun	1
shining	1
south,	1
And	1
the	1
beach-waves	1
combing	1
over	1
the	1
beach	1
on	1
my	1
Eastern	1
shore,	1
and	1
my	1
Western	1
shore	1
the	1
same,	1
And	1
all	1
between	1
those	1
shores,	1
and	1
my	1
ever	1
running	1
Mississippi	1
with	1
bends	1
and	1
chutes,	1
And	1
my	1
Illinois	1
fields,	1
and	1
my	1
Kansas	1
fields,	1
and	1
my	1
fields	1
of	1
Missouri,	1
The	1
Continent,	1
devoting	1
the	1
whole	1
identity	1
without	1
reserving	1
an	1
atom,	1
Pour	1
in!	1
whelm	1
that	1
which	1
asks,	1
which	1
sings,	1
with	1
all	1
and	1
the	1
yield	1
of	1
all,	1
Fusing	1
and	1
holding,	1
claiming,	1
devouring	1
the	1
whole,	1
No	1
more	1
with	1
tender	1
lip,	1
nor	1
musical	1
labial	1
sound,	1
But	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
emerging	1
for	1
good,	1
our	1
voice	1
persuasive	1
no	1
more,	1
Croaking	1
like	1
crows	1
here	1
in	1
the	1
wind.	1
Poet:	1
My	1
limbs,	1
my	1
veins	1
dilate,	1
my	1
theme	1
is	1
clear	1
at	1
last,	1
Banner	1
so	1
broad	1
advancing	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
night,	1
I	1
sing	1
you	1
haughty	1
and	1
resolute,	1
I	1
burst	1
through	1
where	1
I	1
waited	1
long,	1
too	1
long,	1
deafen'd	1
and	1
blinded,	1
My	1
hearing	1
and	1
tongue	1
are	1
come	1
to	1
me,	1
(a	1
little	1
child	1
taught	1
me,)	1
I	1
hear	1
from	1
above	1
O	1
pennant	1
of	1
war	1
your	1
ironical	1
call	1
and	1
demand,	1
Insensate!	1
insensate!	1
(yet	1
I	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
chant	1
you,)	1
O	1
banner!	1
Not	1
houses	1
of	1
peace	1
indeed	1
are	1
you,	1
nor	1
any	1
nor	1
all	1
their	1
prosperity,	1
(if	1
need	1
be,	1
you	1
shall	1
again	1
have	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
houses	1
to	1
destroy	1
them,	1
You	1
thought	1
not	1
to	1
destroy	1
those	1
valuable	1
houses,	1
standing	1
fast,	1
full	1
of	1
comfort,	1
built	1
with	1
money,	1
May	1
they	1
stand	1
fast,	1
then?	1
not	1
an	1
hour	1
except	1
you	1
above	1
them	1
and	1
all	1
stand	1
fast;)	1
O	1
banner,	1
not	1
money	1
so	1
precious	1
are	1
you,	1
not	1
farm	1
produce	1
you,	1
nor	1
the	1

good	1
nutriment,	1
Nor	1
excellent	1
stores,	1
nor	1
landed	1
on	1
wharves	1
from	1
the	1

Not	1
the	1
superb	1
ships	1
with	1
sail-power	1
or	1
steam-power,	1
fetching	1
and	1
carrying	1
cargoes,	1
Nor	1
machinery,	1
vehicles,	1
trade,	1
nor	1
revenues--but	1
you	1
as	1
henceforth	1
I	1
see	1
you,	1
Running	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
night,	1
bringing	1
your	1
cluster	1
of	1
stars,	1
(ever-enlarging	1
stars,)	1
Divider	1
of	1
daybreak	1
you,	1
cutting	1
the	1
air,	1
touch'd	1
by	1
the	1
sun,	1
measuring	1
the	1
sky,	1
(Passionately	1
seen	1
and	1
yearn'd	1
for	1
by	1
one	1
poor	1
little	1
child,	1
While	1
others	1
remain	1
busy	1
or	1
smartly	1
talking,	1
forever	1
teaching	1
thrift,	1
thrift;)	1
O	1
you	1
up	1
there!	1
O	1
pennant!	1
where	1
you	1
undulate	1
like	1
a	1
snake	1
hissing	1
so	1
curious,	1
Out	1
of	1
reach,	1
an	1
idea	1

yet	1
furiously	1
fought	1
for,	1
risking	1
bloody	1
death,	1
loved	1

me,	1
So	1
loved--O	1
you	1
banner	1
leading	1
the	1
day	1
with	1
stars	1
brought	1
from	1
the	1
night!	1
Valueless,	1
object	1
of	1
eyes,	1
over	1
all	1
and	1
demanding	1
all--(absolute	1
owner	1
of	1
all)--O	1
banner	1

pennant!	1
I	1
too	1
leave	1
the	1
rest--great	1
as	1
it	1
is,	1
it	1
is	1
nothing--houses,	1
machines	1
are	1
nothing--I	1
see	1
them	1
not,	1
I	1
see	1
but	1
you,	1
O	1
warlike	1
pennant!	1
O	1
banner	1
so	1
broad,	1
with	1
stripes,	1
sing	1
you	1
only,	1
Flapping	1
up	1
there	1
in	1

O	1

Your	1
Fathomless	1

Rise	1
O	1

Long	1
for	1
my	1
soul	1
hungering	1
gymnastic	1
I	1
devour'd	1
what	1
the	1
earth	1
gave	1
me,	1
Long	1
I	1
roam'd	1
amid	1
the	1
woods	1
of	1
the	1
north,	1
long	1
I	1
watch'd	1
Niagara	1
pouring,	1
I	1
travel'd	1
the	1
prairies	1
over	1
and	1
slept	1
on	1
their	1
breast,	1
I	1
cross'd	1
the	1
Nevadas,	1
I	1
cross'd	1
the	1
plateaus,	1
I	1
ascended	1
the	1
towering	1
rocks	1
along	1
the	1
Pacific,	1
I	1
sail'd	1
out	1
to	1
sea,	1
I	1
sail'd	1
through	1
the	1
storm,	1
I	1
was	1
refresh'd	1
by	1
the	1
storm,	1
I	1
watch'd	1
with	1
joy	1
the	1
threatening	1
maws	1
of	1
the	1
waves,	1
I	1
mark'd	1
the	1
white	1
combs	1
where	1
they	1
career'd	1
so	1
high,	1
curling	1
over,	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
wind	1
piping,	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
black	1
clouds,	1
Saw	1
from	1
below	1
what	1
arose	1
and	1
mounted,	1
(O	1
superb!	1
O	1
wild	1
as	1
my	1
heart,	1
and	1
powerful!)	1
Heard	1
the	1
continuous	1
thunder	1
as	1
it	1
bellow'd	1
after	1
the	1
lightning,	1
Noted	1
the	1
slender	1
and	1
jagged	1
threads	1
of	1
lightning	1
as	1
sudden	1
and	1
fast	1
amid	1
the	1
din	1
they	1
chased	1
each	1
other	1
across	1
the	1
sky;	1
These,	1
and	1
such	1
as	1
these,	1
I,	1
elate,	1
saw--saw	1
with	1
wonder,	1
yet	1
pensive	1
and	1
masterful,	1
All	1
the	1
menacing	1
might	1
of	1
the	1
globe	1
uprisen	1
around	1
me,	1
Yet	1
there	1
with	1
my	1
soul	1
I	1
fed,	1
I	1
fed	1
content,	1
supercilious.	1

'Twas	1
well,	1
O	1
soul--'twas	1
a	1

me,	1

advance	1
our	1
latent	1
and	1
ampler	1
hunger	1

fill,	1
Now	1
we	1
go	1
forth	1
to	1
receive	1
what	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
the	1
sea	1
never	1
gave	1
us,	1
Not	1
through	1
the	1
mighty	1
woods	1
we	1
go,	1
but	1
through	1
the	1
mightier	1
cities,	1
Something	1
for	1
us	1
is	1
pouring	1
now	1
more	1
than	1
Niagara	1
pouring,	1
Torrents	1

What,	1

around	1
me	1
to-day?	1
was	1
the	1

risen?	1
Was	1
the	1
wind	1
piping	1
the	1
pipe	1
of	1
death	1
under	1
the	1
black	1

Lo!	1
from	1
deeps	1
more	1
unfathomable,	1
something	1
more	1
deadly	1
and	1
savage,	1
Manhattan	1
rising,	1
advancing	1
with	1
menacing	1
front--Cincinnati,	1

Story	1

1861-2,	1

Park,	1

the	1

Give	1
me	1
your	1
hand	1
old	1
Revolutionary,	1
The	1
hill-top	1
is	1
nigh,	1
but	1
a	1
few	1
steps,	1
(make	1
room	1
gentlemen,)	1
Up	1
the	1
path	1
you	1
have	1
follow'd	1
me	1
well,	1
spite	1
of	1
your	1
hundred	1
and	1
extra	1
years,	1
You	1
can	1
walk	1
old	1
man,	1
though	1
your	1
eyes	1
are	1
almost	1
done,	1
Your	1
faculties	1
serve	1
you,	1
and	1
presently	1
I	1
must	1
have	1
them	1
serve	1
me.	1
Rest,	1
while	1
I	1
tell	1
what	1
the	1
crowd	1
around	1
us	1
means,	1
On	1
the	1
plain	1
below	1
recruits	1
are	1
drilling	1
and	1
exercising,	1
There	1
is	1
the	1
camp,	1
one	1
regiment	1
departs	1
to-morrow,	1
Do	1
you	1
hear	1
the	1
officers	1
giving	1
their	1
orders?	1
Do	1
you	1
hear	1
the	1
clank	1
of	1
the	1
muskets?	1
Why	1
what	1
comes	1
over	1
you	1
now	1
old	1
man?	1
Why	1
do	1
you	1
tremble	1
and	1
clutch	1
my	1
hand	1
so	1
convulsively?	1
The	1
troops	1
are	1
but	1
drilling,	1
they	1
are	1
yet	1
surrounded	1
with	1
smiles,	1
Around	1
them	1
at	1
hand	1
the	1
well-drest	1
friends	1
and	1
the	1
women,	1
While	1
splendid	1

shines	1
down,	1
Green	1

O'er	1

But	1
drill	1
and	1
parade	1
are	1
over,	1
they	1
march	1
back	1
to	1
quarters,	1
Only	1
hear	1
that	1
approval	1
of	1
hands!	1
hear	1
what	1
a	1
clapping!	1
As	1
wending	1
the	1
crowds	1
now	1
part	1
and	1
disperse--but	1
we	1
old	1
man,	1
Not	1
for	1
nothing	1
have	1
I	1
brought	1
you	1
hither--we	1
must	1
remain,	1
You	1
to	1
speak	1
in	1
your	1
turn,	1
and	1
I	1
to	1
listen	1
and	1
tell.	1
[The	1
Centenarian]	1
When	1
I	1
clutch'd	1
your	1
hand	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
with	1
terror,	1
But	1
suddenly	1
pouring	1
about	1
me	1
here	1
on	1
every	1
side,	1
And	1
below	1
there	1
where	1
the	1
boys	1
were	1
drilling,	1
and	1
up	1
the	1
slopes	1
they	1
ran,	1
And	1
where	1
tents	1
are	1
pitch'd,	1
and	1
wherever	1
you	1
see	1
south	1
and	1
south-	1
east	1

south-west,	1
Over	1
hills,	1
across	1
lowlands,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
skirts	1
of	1
woods,	1
And	1
along	1
the	1
shores,	1
in	1
mire	1
(now	1
fill'd	1
over)	1
came	1
again	1
and	1
suddenly	1
raged,	1
As	1
eighty-five	1
years	1
agone	1
no	1
mere	1
parade	1
receiv'd	1
with	1
applause	1
of	1
friends,	1
But	1
a	1
battle	1
which	1
I	1
took	1
part	1
in	1
myself--aye,	1
long	1
ago	1
as	1
it	1
is,	1
I	1
took	1
part	1
in	1
it,	1
Walking	1
then	1
this	1
hilltop,	1
this	1
same	1
ground.	1
Aye,	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
ground,	1
My	1
blind	1
eyes	1
even	1
as	1
I	1
speak	1
behold	1
it	1
re-peopled	1
from	1
graves,	1
The	1
years	1
recede,	1
pavements	1
and	1
stately	1
houses	1
disappear,	1
Rude	1
forts	1
appear	1
again,	1
the	1
old	1
hoop'd	1
guns	1
are	1
mounted,	1
I	1
see	1
the	1
lines	1
of	1
rais'd	1
earth	1
stretching	1
from	1
river	1
to	1
bay,	1
I	1
mark	1
the	1
vista	1
of	1
waters,	1
I	1
mark	1
the	1
uplands	1
and	1
slopes;	1
Here	1
we	1
lay	1
encamp'd,	1
it	1
was	1
this	1
time	1
in	1
summer	1
also.	1
As	1
I	1
talk	1
I	1
remember	1
all,	1
I	1
remember	1
the	1
Declaration,	1
It	1
was	1
read	1
here,	1
the	1
whole	1
army	1
paraded,	1
it	1
was	1
read	1
to	1
us	1
here,	1
By	1
his	1
staff	1
surrounded	1
the	1
General	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
middle,	1
he	1
held	1
up	1
his	1
unsheath'd	1
sword,	1
It	1
glitter'd	1
in	1
the	1
sun	1
in	1
full	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
army.	1
Twas	1
a	1
bold	1
act	1
then--the	1
English	1
war-ships	1
had	1
just	1
arrived,	1
We	1
could	1
watch	1
down	1
the	1
lower	1
bay	1
where	1
they	1
lay	1
at	1
anchor,	1
And	1
the	1
transports	1
swarming	1
with	1
soldiers.	1
A	1
few	1
days	1
more	1
and	1
they	1
landed,	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
battle.	1
Twenty	1
thousand	1
were	1
brought	1
against	1
us,	1
A	1
veteran	1
force	1
furnish'd	1
with	1
good	1
artillery.	1
I	1
tell	1
not	1
now	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
the	1
battle,	1
But	1
one	1
brigade	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
forenoon	1
order'd	1
forward	1
to	1
engage	1
the	1
red-coats,	1
Of	1
that	1
brigade	1
I	1
tell,	1
and	1
how	1
steadily	1
it	1
march'd,	1
And	1
how	1
long	1
and	1
well	1
it	1
stood	1
confronting	1
death.	1
Who	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
that	1
was	1
marching	1
steadily	1
sternly	1
confronting	1
death?	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
brigade	1
of	1
the	1
youngest	1
men,	1
two	1
thousand	1
strong,	1
Rais'd	1
in	1
Virginia	1
and	1
Maryland,	1
and	1
most	1
of	1
them	1
known	1
personally	1
to	1
the	1
General.	1
Jauntily	1
forward	1
they	1
went	1
with	1
quick	1
step	1
toward	1
Gowanus'	1
waters,	1
Till	1
of	1
a	1
sudden	1
unlook'd	1
for	1
by	1
defiles	1
through	1
the	1
woods,	1
gain'd	1
at	1
night,	1
The	1
British	1
advancing,	1
rounding	1
in	1
from	1
the	1
east,	1
fiercely	1
playing	1
their	1
guns,	1
That	1
brigade	1
of	1
the	1
youngest	1
was	1
cut	1
off	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
enemy's	1
mercy.	1
The	1
General	1
watch'd	1
them	1
from	1
this	1
hill,	1
They	1
made	1
repeated	1
desperate	1
attempts	1
to	1
burst	1
their	1
environment,	1
Then	1
drew	1
close	1
together,	1
very	1
compact,	1
their	1
flag	1
flying	1
in	1
the	1
middle,	1
But	1
O	1
from	1
the	1
hills	1
how	1
the	1
cannon	1
were	1
thinning	1
and	1
thinning	1
them!	1
It	1
sickens	1
me	1
yet,	1
that	1
slaughter!	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
moisture	1
gather	1
in	1
drops	1
on	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
General.	1
I	1
saw	1
how	1
he	1
wrung	1
his	1
hands	1
in	1
anguish.	1
Meanwhile	1
the	1
British	1
manoeuvr'd	1
to	1
draw	1
us	1
out	1
for	1
a	1
pitch'd	1
battle,	1
But	1
we	1
dared	1
not	1
trust	1
the	1
chances	1
of	1
a	1
pitch'd	1
battle.	1
We	1
fought	1
the	1
fight	1
in	1
detachments,	1
Sallying	1
forth	1
we	1
fought	1
at	1
several	1
points,	1
but	1
in	1
each	1
the	1
luck	1
was	1
against	1
us,	1
Our	1
foe	1
advancing,	1
steadily	1
getting	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
it,	1
push'd	1
us	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
works	1
on	1
this	1
hill,	1
Till	1
we	1
turn'd	1
menacing	1
here,	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
left	1
us.	1
That	1
was	1
the	1
going	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
brigade	1
of	1
the	1
youngest	1
men,	1
two	1
thousand	1
strong,	1
Few	1
return'd,	1
nearly	1
all	1
remain	1
in	1
Brooklyn.	1
That	1
and	1
here	1
my	1
General's	1
first	1
battle,	1
No	1
women	1
looking	1
on	1
nor	1
sunshine	1
to	1
bask	1
in,	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
conclude	1
with	1
applause,	1
Nobody	1
clapp'd	1
hands	1
here	1
then.	1
But	1
in	1
darkness	1
in	1
mist	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
under	1
a	1
chill	1
rain,	1
Wearied	1
that	1
night	1
we	1
lay	1
foil'd	1
and	1
sullen,	1
While	1
scornfully	1
laugh'd	1
many	1
an	1
arrogant	1
lord	1
off	1
against	1
us	1
encamp'd,	1
Quite	1
within	1
hearing,	1
feasting,	1
clinking	1
wineglasses	1
together	1
over	1
their	1
victory.	1
So	1
dull	1
and	1
damp	1
and	1
another	1
day,	1
But	1
the	1
night	1
of	1
that,	1
mist	1
lifting,	1
rain	1
ceasing,	1
Silent	1
as	1
a	1
ghost	1
while	1
they	1
thought	1
they	1
were	1
sure	1
of	1
him,	1
my	1
General	1
retreated.	1
I	1
saw	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
river-side,	1
Down	1
by	1
the	1
ferry	1
lit	1
by	1
torches,	1
hastening	1
the	1
embarcation;	1
My	1
General	1
waited	1
till	1
the	1
soldiers	1
and	1
wounded	1
were	1
all	1
pass'd	1
over,	1
And	1
then,	1
(it	1
was	1
just	1
ere	1
sunrise,)	1
these	1
eyes	1
rested	1
on	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
last	1
time.	1
Every	1
one	1
else	1
seem'd	1
fill'd	1
with	1
gloom,	1
Many	1
no	1
doubt	1
thought	1
of	1
capitulation.	1
But	1
when	1
my	1
General	1
pass'd	1
me,	1
As	1
he	1
stood	1
in	1
his	1
boat	1
and	1
look'd	1
toward	1
the	1
coming	1
sun,	1
I	1
saw	1
something	1
different	1
from	1
capitulation.	1
[Terminus]	1
Enough,	1
the	1
Centenarian's	1
story	1
ends,	1
The	1
two,	1
the	1
past	1
and	1
present,	1
have	1
interchanged,	1
I	1
myself	1
as	1
connecter,	1
as	1
chansonnier	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
future,	1
am	1
now	1
speaking.	1
And	1
is	1
this	1
the	1
ground	1
Washington	1
trod?	1
And	1
these	1
waters	1
I	1
listlessly	1
daily	1
cross,	1
are	1
these	1
the	1
waters	1
he	1
cross'd,	1
As	1
resolute	1
in	1
defeat	1
as	1
other	1
generals	1
in	1
their	1
proudest	1
triumphs?	1
I	1
must	1
copy	1
the	1
story,	1
and	1
send	1
it	1
eastward	1
and	1
westward,	1
I	1
must	1
preserve	1
that	1
look	1
as	1
it	1
beam'd	1
on	1
you	1
rivers	1
of	1
Brooklyn.	1

the	1
annual	1
round	1

phantoms	1

It	1
is	1
the	1
27th	1
of	1
August	1

British	1
have	1
landed,	1
The	1

Ah,	1

slopes	1

Brooklyn!	1
I	1
perceive	1
you	1
are	1
more	1
valuable	1
than	1
your	1
owners	1
supposed;	1
In	1
the	1

of	1
you	1
stands	1

gave	1

your	1
body	1
son	1
of	1
responding	1
kisses,	1
(never	1

tear	1
fell,	1
not	1
even	1
a	1
long-drawn	1
sigh,	1
long,	1
long	1
I	1
gazed,	1
Then	1
on	1
the	1
earth	1
partially	1
reclining	1
sat	1

side	1
leaning	1
my	1

hours,	1
immortal	1

mystic	1
hours	1

a	1

not	1
a	1

lingering	1
of	1
the	1

just	1
as	1
the	1

appear'd,	1
My	1
comrade	1
I	1
wrapt	1
in	1
his	1

envelop'd	1
well	1
his	1
form,	1
Folded	1

it	1
carefully	1

carefully	1

A	1
March	1

A	1
march	1
in	1
the	1
ranks	1
hard-prest,	1
and	1
the	1
road	1
unknown,	1
A	1
route	1
through	1
a	1
heavy	1
wood	1
with	1
muffled	1
steps	1
in	1
the	1
darkness,	1
Our	1
army	1
foil'd	1
with	1
loss	1
severe,	1
and	1
the	1
sullen	1
remnant	1
retreating,	1
Till	1
after	1
midnight	1
glimmer	1
upon	1
us	1
the	1
lights	1
of	1
a	1
dim-lighted	1
building,	1
We	1
come	1
to	1
an	1
open	1
space	1
in	1
the	1
woods,	1
and	1
halt	1
by	1
the	1
dim-lighted	1
building,	1
'Tis	1
a	1
large	1
old	1
church	1
at	1
the	1
crossing	1
roads,	1
now	1
an	1
impromptu	1
hospital,	1
Entering	1
but	1
for	1
a	1
minute	1
I	1
see	1
a	1
sight	1
beyond	1
all	1
the	1
pictures	1
and	1
poems	1
ever	1
made,	1
Shadows	1
of	1
deepest,	1
deepest	1
black,	1
just	1
lit	1
by	1
moving	1
candles	1
and	1
lamps,	1
And	1
by	1
one	1
great	1
pitchy	1
torch	1
stationary	1
with	1
wild	1
red	1
flame	1
and	1
clouds	1
of	1
smoke,	1
By	1
these,	1
crowds,	1
groups	1
of	1
forms	1
vaguely	1
I	1
see	1
on	1
the	1
floor,	1
some	1
in	1
the	1
pews	1
laid	1
down,	1
At	1
my	1
feet	1
more	1
distinctly	1
a	1
soldier,	1
a	1
mere	1
lad,	1
in	1
danger	1
of	1
bleeding	1
to	1
death,	1
(he	1
is	1
shot	1
in	1
the	1
abdomen,)	1
I	1
stanch	1
the	1
blood	1
temporarily,	1
(the	1
youngster's	1
face	1
is	1
white	1
as	1
a	1
lily,)	1
Then	1
before	1
I	1
depart	1
I	1
sweep	1
my	1
eyes	1
o'er	1
the	1
scene	1
fain	1
to	1
absorb	1
it	1
all,	1
Faces,	1
varieties,	1
postures	1
beyond	1
description,	1
most	1
in	1
obscurity,	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
dead,	1
Surgeons	1
operating,	1
attendants	1
holding	1
lights,	1
the	1
smell	1
of	1
ether,	1
odor	1
of	1
blood,	1
The	1
crowd,	1
O	1
the	1
crowd	1
of	1
the	1
bloody	1
forms,	1
the	1
yard	1
outside	1
also	1
fill'd,	1
Some	1
on	1
the	1
bare	1
ground,	1
some	1
on	1
planks	1
or	1
stretchers,	1
some	1
in	1
the	1
death-spasm	1
sweating,	1
An	1
occasional	1
scream	1
or	1
cry,	1
the	1
doctor's	1
shouted	1
orders	1
or	1
calls,	1
The	1
glisten	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
steel	1
instruments	1
catching	1
the	1
glint	1
of	1
the	1
torches,	1
These	1
I	1
resume	1
as	1
I	1
chant,	1
I	1
see	1
again	1
the	1
forms,	1
I	1
smell	1
the	1
odor,	1
Then	1
hear	1
outside	1
the	1
orders	1
given,	1
Fall	1
in,	1
my	1
men,	1
fall	1
in;	1
But	1
first	1
I	1
bend	1
to	1
the	1
dying	1
lad,	1
his	1
eyes	1
open,	1
a	1
half-smile	1
gives	1
he	1
me,	1
Then	1
the	1
eyes	1
close,	1
calmly	1
close,	1
and	1
I	1
speed	1
forth	1
to	1
the	1
darkness,	1
Resuming,	1
marching,	1
ever	1
in	1
darkness	1
marching,	1
on	1
in	1
the	1
ranks,	1
The	1
unknown	1
road	1
still	1
marching.	1

A	1

in	1
camp	1
in	1
the	1
daybreak	1
gray	1

As	1
from	1
my	1

early	1
sleepless,	1
As	1
slow	1
I	1
walk	1
in	1
the	1
cool	1
fresh	1
air	1
the	1
path	1
near	1
by	1
the	1
hospital	1
tent,	1
Three	1
forms	1
I	1
see	1
on	1
stretchers	1
lying,	1
brought	1
out	1
there	1
untended	1
lying,	1
Over	1
each	1
the	1
blanket	1
spread,	1
ample	1
brownish	1
woolen	1
blanket,	1
Gray	1

heavy	1
blanket,	1
folding,	1
covering	1
all.	1
Curious	1
I	1
halt	1
and	1
silent	1
stand,	1
Then	1
with	1
light	1
fingers	1
I	1
from	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
nearest	1
the	1
first	1
just	1
lift	1
the	1
blanket;	1
Who	1
are	1
you	1
elderly	1
man	1
so	1
gaunt	1
and	1
grim,	1
with	1
well-gray'd	1
hair,	1
and	1
flesh	1
all	1
sunken	1
about	1
the	1
eyes?	1
Who	1
are	1
you	1
my	1
dear	1
comrade?	1
Then	1
to	1
the	1
second	1
I	1
step--and	1
who	1
are	1
you	1
my	1
child	1
and	1
darling?	1
Who	1
are	1
you	1
sweet	1
boy	1
with	1
cheeks	1
yet	1
blooming?	1
Then	1
to	1
the	1
third--a	1
face	1
nor	1
child	1
nor	1
old,	1
very	1
calm,	1
as	1
of	1
beautiful	1
yellow-white	1
ivory;	1
Young	1
man	1
I	1
think	1
I	1
know	1
you--I	1
think	1
this	1
face	1
is	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
Christ	1
himself,	1
Dead	1
and	1
divine	1
and	1
brother	1
of	1
all,	1

here	1
again	1
he	1
lies.	1

In	1

plunge	1
in	1
the	1

loudly	1
shout	1
in	1

of	1
successful	1

Enter	1
the	1

works--yet	1
lo,	1
like	1
a	1
swift-running	1
river	1
they	1
fade,	1
Pass	1
and	1
are	1
gone	1
they	1
fade--I	1
dwell	1
not	1
on	1
soldiers'	1
perils	1
or	1
soldiers'	1
joys,	1
(Both	1
I	1
remember	1
well--many	1
the	1
hardships,	1
few	1
the	1
joys,	1
yet	1
I	1
was	1
content.)	1
But	1
in	1
silence,	1
in	1
dreams'	1
projections,	1
While	1
the	1
world	1
of	1

So	1
soon	1

Bearing	1

One	1
turns	1

boy!	1
I	1
never	1
knew	1
you,	1
Yet	1
I	1
think	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
refuse	1
this	1
moment	1
to	1
die	1
for	1
you,	1
if	1
that	1
would	1
save	1
you.	1

On,	1
on	1
I	1
go,	1
(open	1
doors	1
of	1
time!	1
open	1
hospital	1
doors!)	1
The	1
crush'd	1
head	1
I	1
dress,	1
(poor	1
crazed	1
hand	1
tear	1
not	1
the	1
bandage	1
away,)	1
The	1
neck	1
of	1
the	1
cavalry-man	1
with	1
the	1
bullet	1
through	1
and	1
through	1
examine,	1
Hard	1
the	1
breathing	1
rattles,	1
quite	1
glazed	1
already	1
the	1
eye,	1
yet	1
life	1
struggles	1
hard,	1
(Come	1
sweet	1
death!	1
be	1
persuaded	1
O	1
beautiful	1
death!	1
In	1
mercy	1
come	1
quickly.)	1
From	1
the	1
stump	1
of	1
the	1
arm,	1
the	1
amputated	1
hand,	1
I	1
undo	1
the	1
clotted	1
lint,	1
remove	1
the	1
slough,	1
wash	1
off	1
the	1
matter	1
and	1

neck	1

are	1
closed,	1

pale,	1

dares	1
not	1
look	1
on	1
the	1
bloody	1
stump,	1

has	1
not	1

look'd	1

two	1

all	1
wasted	1

sinking,	1
And	1

yellow-blue	1

shoulder,	1

foot	1
with	1

one	1

whirring,	1
And	1

through.	1

at	1
my	1
side	1
lies	1

And	1
through	1
the	1
stillness,	1
through	1

dark,	1
I	1
hear,	1
just	1
hear,	1
the	1
breath	1
of	1
my	1
infant,	1
There	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
as	1
I	1
wake	1
from	1
sleep	1
this	1
vision	1
presses	1
upon	1
me;	1
The	1
engagement	1
opens	1
there	1
and	1
then	1
in	1
fantasy	1
unreal,	1
The	1
skirmishers	1
begin,	1
they	1
crawl	1
cautiously	1
ahead,	1
I	1
hear	1
the	1
irregular	1
snap!	1
snap!	1
I	1
hear	1
the	1
sounds	1
of	1
the	1
different	1
missiles,	1
the	1
short	1
t-h-t!	1
t-h-t!	1
of	1
the	1
rifle-balls,	1
I	1
see	1
the	1
shells	1
exploding	1
leaving	1
small	1
white	1
clouds,	1
I	1
hear	1
the	1
great	1
shells	1
shrieking	1
as	1
they	1
pass,	1
The	1
grape	1
like	1
the	1
hum	1
and	1
whirr	1
of	1
wind	1
through	1
the	1
trees,	1
(tumultuous	1
now	1
the	1
contest	1
rages,)	1
All	1
the	1
scenes	1
at	1
the	1
batteries	1
rise	1
in	1
detail	1
before	1
me	1
again,	1
The	1
crashing	1
and	1
smoking,	1
the	1
pride	1
of	1
the	1
men	1

After	1
firing	1
I	1
see	1
him	1
lean	1
aside	1
and	1
look	1
eagerly	1
off	1
to	1
note	1
the	1
effect;	1
Elsewhere	1
I	1
hear	1
the	1
cry	1
of	1
a	1
regiment	1
charging,	1
(the	1
young	1
colonel	1
leads	1
himself	1
this	1
time	1
with	1
brandish'd	1
sword,)	1
I	1
see	1
the	1
gaps	1
cut	1
by	1
the	1
enemy's	1
volleys,	1
(quickly	1
fill'd	1
up,	1
no	1
delay,)	1
I	1
breathe	1
the	1
suffocating	1
smoke,	1
then	1
the	1
flat	1
clouds	1
hover	1
low	1
concealing	1
all;	1
Now	1
a	1
strange	1
lull	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
seconds,	1
not	1
a	1
shot	1
fired	1
on	1
either	1
side,	1
Then	1
resumed	1
the	1
chaos	1
louder	1
than	1
ever,	1
with	1
eager	1
calls	1
and	1
orders	1
of	1
officers,	1
While	1
from	1
some	1
distant	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
the	1
wind	1
wafts	1
to	1
my	1
ears	1
a	1
shout	1
of	1
applause,	1
(some	1
special	1
success,)	1
And	1
ever	1
the	1

O	1
western	1
orb	1
sailing	1
the	1
heaven,	1
Now	1
I	1
know	1
what	1
you	1
must	1
have	1
meant	1
as	1
a	1
month	1
since	1
I	1
walk'd,	1
As	1
I	1
walk'd	1
in	1
silence	1
the	1
transparent	1
shadowy	1
night,	1
As	1
I	1
saw	1
you	1
had	1
something	1
to	1
tell	1
as	1
you	1
bent	1
to	1
me	1
night	1
after	1
night,	1
As	1
you	1
droop'd	1
from	1
the	1
sky	1
low	1
down	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
my	1
side,	1
(while	1
the	1
other	1
stars	1
all	1
look'd	1
on,)	1
As	1
we	1
wander'd	1
together	1
the	1
solemn	1
night,	1
(for	1
something	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
what	1
kept	1
me	1
from	1
sleep,)	1
As	1
the	1
night	1
advanced,	1
and	1
I	1
saw	1
on	1
the	1
rim	1
of	1
the	1
west	1
how	1
full	1
you	1
were	1
of	1
woe,	1
As	1
I	1
stood	1
on	1
the	1
rising	1
ground	1
in	1
the	1
breeze	1
in	1
the	1
cool	1
transparent	1
night,	1
As	1
I	1
watch'd	1
where	1
you	1
pass'd	1
and	1
was	1
lost	1
in	1
the	1
netherward	1
black	1
of	1
the	1
night,	1
As	1
my	1
soul	1
in	1
its	1
trouble	1
dissatisfied	1
sank,	1
as	1
where	1
you	1
sad	1
orb,	1
Concluded,	1
dropt	1
in	1
the	1
night,	1
and	1
was	1
gone.	1
9	1
Sing	1
on	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
swamp,	1
O	1
singer	1
bashful	1
and	1
tender,	1
I	1
hear	1
your	1
notes,	1
I	1
hear	1
your	1
call,	1
I	1
hear,	1
I	1
come	1
presently,	1
I	1
understand	1
you,	1
But	1
a	1
moment	1
I	1
linger,	1
for	1
the	1
lustrous	1
star	1
has	1
detain'd	1
me,	1
The	1
star	1
my	1
departing	1
comrade	1
holds	1
and	1
detains	1
me.	1
10	1
O	1
how	1
shall	1
I	1
warble	1
myself	1
for	1
the	1
dead	1
one	1
there	1
I	1
loved?	1
And	1
how	1
shall	1
I	1
deck	1
my	1
song	1
for	1
the	1
large	1
sweet	1
soul	1
that	1
has	1
gone?	1
And	1
what	1
shall	1
my	1
perfume	1
be	1
for	1
the	1
grave	1

him	1
I	1
love?	1
Sea-winds	1
blown	1
from	1
east	1

west,	1
Blown	1
from	1

blown	1

I'll	1
perfume	1

Fourth-month	1

gorgeous,	1
indolent,	1
sinking	1

burning,	1
expanding	1

With	1

and	1
the	1
pale	1

In	1

the	1

the	1

with	1
a	1
wind-dapple	1
here	1

there,	1
With	1
ranging	1
hills	1
on	1
the	1
banks,	1
with	1
many	1
a	1
line	1
against	1
the	1

And	1
the	1

so	1
dense,	1

And	1
all	1
the	1
scenes	1
of	1

and	1
the	1

and	1
the	1
workmen	1
homeward	1

Lo,	1
body	1
and	1
soul--this	1

My	1

with	1
spires,	1
and	1
the	1
sparkling	1

Ohio's	1

flashing	1

corn.	1
Lo,	1
the	1
most	1
excellent	1
sun	1
so	1
calm	1
and	1
haughty,	1
The	1
violet	1
and	1
purple	1
morn	1
with	1
just-felt	1
breezes,	1
The	1
gentle	1
soft-born	1
measureless	1
light,	1
The	1
miracle	1
spreading	1
bathing	1
all,	1
the	1
fulfill'd	1
noon,	1
The	1
coming	1
eve	1
delicious,	1
the	1
welcome	1
night	1
and	1
the	1
stars,	1
Over	1
my	1
cities	1
shining	1
all,	1
enveloping	1
man	1
and	1
land.	1
13	1
Sing	1
on,	1
sing	1
on	1
you	1
gray-brown	1
bird,	1
Sing	1
from	1
the	1
swamps,	1
the	1
recesses,	1
pour	1
your	1
chant	1
from	1
the	1
bushes,	1
Limitless	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
dusk,	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
cedars	1
and	1
pines.	1
Sing	1
on	1
dearest	1
brother,	1
warble	1
your	1
reedy	1
song,	1
Loud	1
human	1
song,	1
with	1
voice	1
of	1
uttermost	1
woe.	1
O	1
liquid	1
and	1
free	1
and	1
tender!	1
O	1
wild	1
and	1
loose	1
to	1
my	1
soul--O	1
wondrous	1
singer!	1
You	1
only	1
I	1
hear--yet	1
the	1
star	1
holds	1
me,	1
(but	1
will	1
soon	1
depart,)	1
Yet	1
the	1
lilac	1
with	1
mastering	1
odor	1
holds	1
me.	1
14	1
Now	1
while	1
I	1
sat	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
and	1
look'd	1
forth,	1
In	1
the	1
close	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
with	1
its	1
light	1
and	1
the	1
fields	1
of	1
spring,	1
and	1
the	1
farmers	1
preparing	1
their	1
crops,	1
In	1
the	1
large	1
unconscious	1
scenery	1
of	1
my	1
land	1
with	1
its	1
lakes	1
and	1
forests,	1
In	1
the	1
heavenly	1
aerial	1
beauty,	1
(after	1
the	1
perturb'd	1
winds	1
and	1
the	1
storms,)	1
Under	1
the	1
arching	1
heavens	1
of	1
the	1
afternoon	1
swift	1
passing,	1
and	1
the	1
voices	1
of	1
children	1
and	1
women,	1
The	1
many-moving	1
sea-tides,	1
and	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
ships	1
how	1
they	1
sail'd,	1
And	1
the	1
summer	1
approaching	1
with	1
richness,	1
and	1
the	1
fields	1
all	1
busy	1
with	1
labor,	1
And	1
the	1
infinite	1
separate	1
houses,	1
how	1
they	1
all	1
went	1
on,	1
each	1
with	1
its	1
meals	1
and	1
minutia	1
of	1
daily	1
usages,	1
And	1
the	1
streets	1
how	1
their	1
throbbings	1
throbb'd,	1
and	1
the	1
cities	1
pent--	1
lo,	1
then	1
and	1
there,	1
Falling	1
upon	1
them	1
all	1
and	1
among	1
them	1
all,	1
enveloping	1
me	1
with	1
the	1
rest,	1
Appear'd	1
the	1
cloud,	1
appear'd	1
the	1
long	1
black	1
trail,	1
And	1
I	1
knew	1
death,	1
its	1
thought,	1
and	1
the	1
sacred	1
knowledge	1
of	1
death.	1
Then	1
with	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
death	1
as	1
walking	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
me,	1
And	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
death	1
close-walking	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
me,	1
And	1
I	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
as	1
with	1
companions,	1
and	1
as	1
holding	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
companions,	1
I	1
fled	1
forth	1
to	1
the	1
hiding	1
receiving	1
night	1
that	1
talks	1
not,	1
Down	1
to	1
the	1
shores	1
of	1
the	1
water,	1
the	1
path	1
by	1
the	1
swamp	1
in	1
the	1
dimness,	1
To	1
the	1
solemn	1
shadowy	1
cedars	1
and	1
ghostly	1
pines	1
so	1
still.	1
And	1
the	1
singer	1
so	1
shy	1
to	1
the	1
rest	1
receiv'd	1
me,	1
The	1
gray-brown	1
bird	1
I	1
know	1
receiv'd	1
us	1
comrades	1
three,	1
And	1
he	1
sang	1
the	1
carol	1
of	1
death,	1
and	1
a	1
verse	1
for	1
him	1
I	1
love.	1
From	1
deep	1
secluded	1
recesses,	1
From	1
the	1
fragrant	1
cedars	1
and	1
the	1
ghostly	1
pines	1
so	1
still,	1
Came	1
the	1
carol	1
of	1
the	1
bird.	1
And	1
the	1
charm	1
of	1
the	1
carol	1
rapt	1
me,	1
As	1
I	1
held	1
as	1
if	1
by	1
their	1
hands	1
my	1
comrades	1
in	1
the	1
night,	1
And	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
my	1
spirit	1
tallied	1
the	1
song	1
of	1
the	1
bird.	1
Come	1
lovely	1
and	1
soothing	1
death,	1
Undulate	1
round	1
the	1
world,	1
serenely	1
arriving,	1
arriving,	1
In	1
the	1
day,	1
in	1
the	1
night,	1
to	1
all,	1
to	1
each,	1
Sooner	1
or	1
later	1
delicate	1

Prais'd	1

For	1

And	1
for	1

praise!	1
praise!	1
praise!	1
For	1
the	1
sure-enwinding	1
arms	1

cool-enfolding	1

Dark	1

gliding	1
near	1
with	1
soft	1

Have	1
none	1
chanted	1
for	1
thee	1
a	1
chant	1
of	1
fullest	1
welcome?	1
Then	1
I	1
chant	1
it	1
for	1
thee,	1
I	1
glorify	1
thee	1
above	1
all,	1
I	1
bring	1
thee	1
a	1

that	1
when	1
thou	1
must	1
indeed	1
come,	1
come	1
unfalteringly.	1
Approach	1
strong	1

When	1
it	1
is	1
so,	1
when	1
thou	1
hast	1
taken	1
them	1

joyously	1
sing	1

Lost	1

thee,	1
Laved	1

thy	1

From	1

thee	1
glad	1

Dances	1
for	1
thee	1
I	1
propose	1
saluting	1
thee,	1
adornments	1

for	1
thee,	1
And	1
the	1
sights	1
of	1
the	1

And	1

And	1
the	1
body	1
gratefully	1
nestling	1
close	1
to	1
thee.	1
Over	1

Over	1

Over	1

and	1
the	1

I	1
float	1
this	1
carol	1
with	1
joy,	1
with	1
joy	1
to	1
thee	1
O	1
death.	1

I	1
with	1
my	1

there	1
in	1
the	1
night.	1
While	1
my	1
sight	1

unclosed,	1
As	1

And	1
I	1
saw	1

the	1

I	1
saw	1
as	1
in	1
noiseless	1
dreams	1
hundreds	1

battle-flags,	1
Borne	1
through	1
the	1
smoke	1
of	1
the	1
battles	1

pierc'd	1
with	1
missiles	1
I	1
saw	1
them,	1
And	1
carried	1
hither	1
and	1
yon	1
through	1
the	1
smoke,	1
and	1
torn	1
and	1
bloody,	1
And	1
at	1
last	1
but	1
a	1
few	1
shreds	1
left	1
on	1
the	1
staffs,	1
(and	1
all	1
in	1
silence,)	1
And	1
the	1
staffs	1
all	1
splinter'd	1
and	1
broken.	1
I	1
saw	1
battle-corpses,	1
myriads	1
of	1
them,	1
And	1
the	1
white	1
skeletons	1
of	1
young	1
men,	1
I	1
saw	1
them,	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
debris	1
and	1
debris	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
slain	1
soldiers	1
of	1
the	1
war,	1
But	1
I	1
saw	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
as	1
was	1
thought,	1
They	1
themselves	1
were	1
fully	1
at	1
rest,	1
they	1
suffer'd	1
not,	1
The	1
living	1
remain'd	1
and	1
suffer'd,	1
the	1
mother	1
suffer'd,	1
And	1
the	1
wife	1
and	1
the	1
child	1
and	1
the	1
musing	1
comrade	1
suffer'd,	1
And	1
the	1

that	1
remain'd	1
suffer'd.	1

Have	1
you	1

there	1
could	1
be	1

a	1

There	1
can	1
be	1
any	1

of	1
supremes--one	1
does	1
not	1
countervail	1
another	1
any	1
more	1
than	1
one	1

another,	1

Ages,	1
precedents,	1
have	1
long	1
been	1
accumulating	1
undirected	1
materials,	1
America	1
brings	1
builders,	1
and	1
brings	1
its	1
own	1
styles.	1
The	1
immortal	1
poets	1
of	1
Asia	1
and	1
Europe	1
have	1
done	1
their	1
work	1
and	1
pass'd	1
to	1
other	1
spheres,	1
A	1
work	1
remains,	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
surpassing	1
all	1
they	1
have	1
done.	1
America,	1
curious	1
toward	1
foreign	1
characters,	1
stands	1
by	1
its	1
own	1
at	1
all	1
hazards,	1
Stands	1
removed,	1
spacious,	1
composite,	1
sound,	1
initiates	1
the	1
true	1
use	1
of	1
precedents,	1
Does	1
not	1
repel	1
them	1
or	1
the	1
past	1
or	1
what	1
they	1
have	1
produced	1
under	1
their	1
forms,	1
Takes	1
the	1
lesson	1
with	1
calmness,	1
perceives	1
the	1
corpse	1
slowly	1
borne	1
from	1
the	1
house,	1
Perceives	1
that	1
it	1
waits	1
a	1
little	1
while	1
in	1
the	1
door,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
fittest	1
for	1
its	1
days,	1
That	1
its	1
life	1
has	1
descended	1
to	1
the	1
stalwart	1
and	1
well-shaped	1
heir	1
who	1
approaches,	1
And	1
that	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
fittest	1
for	1
his	1
days.	1
Any	1
period	1
one	1
nation	1
must	1
lead,	1
One	1
land	1
must	1
be	1
the	1
promise	1
and	1
reliance	1
of	1
the	1
future.	1
These	1
States	1
are	1
the	1
amplest	1
poem,	1
Here	1
is	1
not	1
merely	1
a	1
nation	1
but	1
a	1
teeming	1
Nation	1
of	1
nations,	1
Here	1
the	1
doings	1
of	1
men	1
correspond	1
with	1
the	1
broadcast	1
doings	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
and	1
night,	1
Here	1
is	1
what	1
moves	1
in	1
magnificent	1
masses	1
careless	1
of	1
particulars,	1
Here	1
are	1
the	1
roughs,	1
beards,	1
friendliness,	1
combativeness,	1
the	1
soul	1
loves,	1
Here	1
the	1
flowing	1
trains,	1
here	1
the	1
crowds,	1
equality,	1
diversity,	1
the	1
soul	1

hanging	1

Plunging	1

Of	1

off	1
from	1
him	1
things	1
are	1
grotesque,	1
eccentric,	1
fail	1
of	1
their	1
full	1

Nothing	1
out	1
of	1
its	1
place	1
is	1
good,	1
nothing	1
in	1
its	1
place	1
is	1
bad,	1
He	1
bestows	1
on	1
every	1
object	1
or	1
quality	1
its	1
fit	1
proportion,	1
neither	1
more	1
nor	1
less,	1
He	1
is	1
the	1
arbiter	1
of	1
the	1
diverse,	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
key,	1
He	1
is	1
the	1
equalizer	1
of	1
his	1
age	1
and	1
land,	1
He	1
supplies	1
what	1
wants	1
supplying,	1
he	1
checks	1
what	1
wants	1
checking,	1
In	1
peace	1
out	1

he	1

as	1
the	1

he	1
can	1
make	1
every	1
word	1
he	1
speaks	1
draw	1
blood,	1
The	1
years	1
straying	1
toward	1
infidelity	1
he	1
withholds	1
by	1
his	1
steady	1
faith,	1
He	1
is	1
no	1
arguer,	1
he	1
is	1
judgment,	1
(Nature	1
accepts	1
him	1
absolutely,)	1
He	1
judges	1
not	1
as	1
the	1
judge	1
judges	1
but	1
as	1
the	1
sun	1
failing	1
round	1
helpless	1
thing,	1
As	1
he	1
sees	1
the	1
farthest	1
he	1
has	1
the	1
most	1
faith,	1
His	1
thoughts	1
are	1
the	1
hymns	1
of	1
the	1
praise	1
of	1
things,	1
In	1
the	1
dispute	1
on	1
God	1
and	1
eternity	1
he	1
is	1
silent,	1
He	1
sees	1
eternity	1
less	1
like	1
a	1
play	1
with	1
a	1
prologue	1
and	1
denouement,	1
He	1
sees	1
eternity	1
in	1
men	1

he	1
does	1

it	1
is	1

up	1

to	1

shows,	1
to	1
form	1
individuals.	1
Underneath	1
all,	1
individuals,	1
I	1
swear	1
nothing	1
is	1
good	1
to	1
me	1
now	1
that	1
ignores	1
individuals,	1
The	1
American	1
compact	1
is	1
altogether	1
with	1
individuals,	1
The	1
only	1
government	1
is	1
that	1
which	1
makes	1
minute	1
of	1
individuals,	1
The	1
whole	1
theory	1
of	1
the	1
universe	1
is	1
directed	1
unerringly	1
to	1
one	1
single	1
individual--namely	1
to	1
You.	1
(Mother!	1
with	1
subtle	1
sense	1
severe,	1
with	1
the	1
naked	1
sword	1
in	1
your	1
hand,	1
I	1
saw	1
you	1
at	1
last	1
refuse	1
to	1
treat	1
but	1
directly	1
with	1
individuals.)	1

Underneath	1
all,	1
Nativity,	1
I	1
swear	1
I	1
will	1
stand	1
by	1
my	1
own	1

pious	1
or	1
impious	1
so	1
be	1
it;	1
I	1

I	1
am	1
charm'd	1
with	1
nothing	1
except	1
nativity,	1
Men,	1
women,	1
cities,	1
nations,	1
are	1
only	1
beautiful	1
from	1
nativity.	1
Underneath	1
all	1
is	1
the	1
Expression	1
of	1
love	1
for	1
men	1
and	1
women,	1
(I	1
swear	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
enough	1
of	1
mean	1
and	1
impotent	1
modes	1
of	1
expressing	1
love	1
for	1
men	1
and	1
women,	1
After	1
this	1
day	1
I	1
take	1
my	1
own	1
modes	1
of	1
expressing	1
love	1
for	1
men	1
and	1
women.)	1
in	1
myself,	1
I	1

I	1
will	1
have	1
each	1
quality	1
of	1
my	1
race	1
in	1
myself,	1
(Talk	1

Underneath	1
the	1

of	1
things,	1

Nature,	1

ownerships,	1
I	1

I	1

Underneath	1
all	1
to	1
me	1

myself,	1
to	1
you	1
yourself,	1
(the	1

monotonous	1
old	1
song.)	1
17	1
O	1
I	1
see	1
flashing	1
that	1
this	1

only	1
you	1

are	1
you	1

Its	1
crimes,	1
lies,	1
thefts,	1
defections,	1
are	1
you	1

me,	1
Its	1
Congress	1

you	1

Its	1
endless	1
gestations	1

you	1

The	1

(that	1

grim,	1
the	1

When	1

slow	1

through	1
the	1

flush'd	1
immortal	1
ranks,	1

Ask	1
room	1
alas	1
the	1
ghastly	1
ranks,	1
the	1

that	1
follow'd.	1

And	1
along	1

you	1
Departed,	1
Nor	1
in	1
winter	1

my	1

ones,	1
But	1
most	1
in	1

as	1
now	1
when	1
my	1
soul	1
is	1
rapt	1
and	1
at	1
peace,	1
like	1
pleasing	1
phantoms,	1
Your	1
memories	1
rising	1
glide	1
silently	1
by	1
me.	1

I	1
saw	1
the	1

the	1

never	1

I	1
saw	1
the	1
interminable	1
corps,	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
processions	1

armies,	1
I	1
saw	1
them	1
approaching,	1
defiling	1
by	1
with	1
divisions,	1
Streaming	1
northward,	1
their	1
work	1
done,	1
camping	1
awhile	1

mighty	1
camps.	1
No	1

veterans,	1
Worn,	1
swart,	1

homestead	1

Harden'd	1

long	1
campaign	1
and	1
sweaty	1
march,	1
Inured	1
on	1
many	1
a	1
hard-fought	1
bloody	1
field.	1
A	1
pause--the	1
armies	1
wait,	1
A	1
million	1
flush'd	1
embattled	1
conquerors	1
wait,	1
The	1
world	1
too	1
waits,	1
then	1
soft	1
as	1
breaking	1
night	1
and	1
sure	1
as	1
dawn,	1
They	1
melt,	1
they	1
disappear.	1

Not	1

your	1
victory	1
on	1
those	1

shuddering	1
fields,	1
But	1
here	1
and	1
hence	1
your	1
victory.	1
Melt,	1
melt	1
away	1
ye	1
armies--disperse	1
ye	1
blue-clad	1
soldiers,	1
Resolve	1
ye	1

good	1

Fair,	1
fearful	1

crumbled,	1
crush'd,	1
House	1

life,	1
erewhile	1
talking	1

ah,	1
poor	1
house,	1
dead	1
even	1

an	1

dead,	1
dead,	1
dead.	1

where	1
I	1

was	1

I	1
withdraw	1
from	1
the	1

woods	1
I	1

I	1
will	1
not	1
go	1
now	1
on	1

I	1
will	1
not	1
strip	1
the	1

O	1
how	1
can	1
it	1
be	1
that	1
the	1

How	1

How	1

you	1

Are	1

The	1

the	1

The	1
bean	1
bursts	1
noiselessly	1
through	1
the	1
mould	1
in	1
the	1
garden,	1
The	1
delicate	1
spear	1
of	1
the	1
onion	1
pierces	1
upward,	1
The	1
apple-buds	1
cluster	1
together	1
on	1
the	1
apple-branches,	1
The	1
resurrection	1
of	1
the	1
wheat	1
appears	1
with	1
pale	1

out	1
of	1
its	1

the	1

Out	1

innocent	1
and	1
disdainful	1
above	1
all	1
those	1

of	1
sour	1

What	1
chemistry!	1
That	1
the	1
winds	1
are	1
really	1
not	1
infectious,	1
That	1
this	1
is	1
no	1

this	1
transparent	1
green-wash	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
which	1
is	1

to	1
allow	1
it	1
to	1
lick	1
my	1
naked	1

all	1

with	1
its	1

will	1
not	1
endanger	1
me	1
with	1
the	1
fevers	1
that	1
have	1
deposited	1
themselves	1
in	1
it,	1
That	1
all	1
is	1
clean	1
forever	1
and	1
forever,	1
That	1
the	1
cool	1

good,	1

the	1

melons,	1
grapes,	1

none	1

probably	1
every	1

out	1
of	1
what	1

out	1
of	1
such	1
corruptions,	1
It	1
turns	1
harmless	1
and	1
stainless	1
on	1
its	1
axis,	1
with	1
such	1
endless	1
successions	1
of	1
diseas'd	1
corpses,	1
It	1
distills	1
such	1
exquisite	1
winds	1
out	1
of	1
such	1
infused	1
fetor,	1
It	1
renews	1
with	1
such	1
unwitting	1
looks	1
its	1
prodigal,	1
annual,	1
sumptuous	1
crops,	1
It	1
gives	1
such	1
divine	1
materials	1
to	1
men,	1
and	1
accepts	1
such	1
leavings	1
from	1
them	1
at	1

What	1

through	1

the	1

Invites	1
no	1

sits	1

It	1

Some	1

On	1

The	1

Little	1
and	1
large	1
alike	1

quietly	1
aside	1
from	1
the	1

that	1

immortality.	1
The	1

of	1
itself,	1
All	1
verges	1
to	1
it,	1
all	1
has	1
reference	1
to	1
what	1
ensues,	1
All	1
that	1
a	1
person	1
does,	1
says,	1
thinks,	1
is	1
of	1
consequence,	1
Not	1
a	1
move	1
can	1
a	1

that	1

any	1

the	1

or	1
the	1

But	1
the	1

affects	1
him	1
or	1
her	1
onward	1
afterward	1
through	1
the	1
indirect	1
lifetime.	1
The	1
indirect	1
is	1
just	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
the	1
direct,	1
The	1
spirit	1
receives	1
from	1
the	1
body	1
just	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
it	1
gives	1
to	1
the	1
body,	1
if	1
not	1
more.	1
Not	1
one	1
word	1
or	1
deed,	1
not	1
venereal	1
sore,	1
discoloration,	1
privacy	1
of	1
the	1
onanist,	1
Putridity	1
of	1
gluttons	1
or	1
rum-drinkers,	1
peculation,	1
cunning,	1
betrayal,	1
murder,	1
seduction,	1
prostitution,	1
But	1
has	1
results	1
beyond	1
death	1
as	1
really	1
as	1
before	1
death.	1
Charity	1
and	1
personal	1
force	1
are	1
the	1
only	1
investments	1
worth	1
any	1
thing.	1
No	1
specification	1
is	1
necessary,	1
all	1
that	1
a	1
male	1
or	1
female	1
does,	1
that	1
is	1
vigorous,	1
benevolent,	1
clean,	1
is	1
so	1
much	1
profit	1
to	1
him	1
or	1
her,	1
In	1
the	1
unshakable	1
order	1
of	1
the	1
universe	1
and	1
through	1
the	1
whole	1
scope	1
of	1
it	1
forever.	1
Who	1
has	1
been	1
wise	1
receives	1
interest,	1
Savage,	1
felon,	1
President,	1
judge,	1
farmer,	1
sailor,	1
mechanic,	1
literat,	1
young,	1
old,	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
same,	1
The	1
interest	1
will	1
come	1
round--all	1
will	1
come	1
round.	1
Singly,	1
wholly,	1
to	1
affect	1
now,	1
affected	1
their	1
time,	1
will	1
forever	1

Did	1
you	1
guess	1
any	1
thing	1
lived	1
only	1
its	1
moment?	1
The	1
world	1
does	1
not	1
so	1
exist,	1
no	1
parts	1
palpable	1
or	1
impalpable	1
so	1
exist,	1
No	1
consummation	1
exists	1
without	1
being	1
from	1
some	1
long	1
previous	1
consummation,	1
and	1
that	1
from	1
some	1
other,	1
Without	1
the	1
farthest	1
conceivable	1
one	1
coming	1
a	1
bit	1
nearer	1
the	1
beginning	1
than	1
any.	1
Whatever	1
satisfies	1
souls	1
is	1
true;	1
Prudence	1
entirely	1
satisfies	1
the	1
craving	1
and	1
glut	1
of	1
souls,	1
Itself	1
only	1
finally	1
satisfies	1
the	1
soul,	1
The	1
soul	1
has	1
that	1
measureless	1
pride	1
which	1
revolts	1
from	1
every	1
lesson	1
but	1
its	1
own.	1
Now	1
I	1
breathe	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
prudence	1
that	1
walks	1
abreast	1
with	1
time,	1
space,	1
reality,	1
That	1
answers	1
the	1
pride	1
which	1
refuses	1
every	1
lesson	1
but	1
its	1
own.	1
What	1
is	1
prudence	1
is	1
indivisible,	1
Declines	1
to	1
separate	1
one	1
part	1
of	1
life	1
from	1
every	1
part,	1
Divides	1
not	1
the	1
righteous	1
from	1
the	1
unrighteous	1
or	1
the	1
living	1
from	1
the	1
dead,	1
Matches	1
every	1
thought	1
or	1
act	1
by	1
its	1
correlative,	1
Knows	1
no	1
possible	1
forgiveness	1
or	1
deputed	1
atonement,	1
Knows	1
that	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
who	1
composedly	1
peril'd	1
his	1
life	1
and	1
lost	1
it	1
has	1
done	1
exceedingly	1
well	1
for	1
himself	1
without	1
doubt,	1
That	1
he	1
who	1
never	1
peril'd	1
his	1
life,	1
but	1
retains	1
it	1
to	1
old	1
age	1
in	1
riches	1
and	1
ease,	1
has	1
probably	1
achiev'd	1
nothing	1
for	1
himself	1
worth	1
mentioning,	1
Knows	1
that	1
only	1
that	1
person	1
has	1
really	1
learn'd	1
who	1
has	1
learn'd	1
to	1
prefer	1

Who	1
favors	1

Who	1
perceives	1

Who	1
in	1
his	1

in	1

neither	1

avoids	1

She,	1

with	1

a	1
low	1
and	1
musical	1
prelude,	1
In	1
voice	1
surpassing	1

sang	1
forth	1
a	1
quaint	1
old	1
hymn.	1
A	1
soul	1

Cries,	1

O	1

Ceaseless	1

the	1

a	1

(Ah	1

the	1

or	1
Robert,	1
Gounod's	1
Faust,	1

Mozart's	1

I	1

the	1

The	1
waltz,	1
some	1
delicious	1
measure,	1
lapsing,	1
bathing	1
me	1
in	1
bliss,	1
The	1
bolero	1
to	1
tinkling	1

and	1
clattering	1
castanets.	1
I	1
see	1
religious	1

old	1
and	1
new,	1
I	1
hear	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
Hebrew	1
lyre,	1
I	1
see	1
the	1
crusaders	1
marching	1
bearing	1
the	1
cross	1
on	1
high,	1
to	1
the	1
martial	1
clang	1
of	1
cymbals,	1
I	1
hear	1
dervishes	1
monotonously	1
chanting,	1
interspers'd	1
with	1
frantic	1
shouts,	1
as	1
they	1
spin	1
around	1
turning	1
always	1
towards	1
Mecca,	1
I	1
see	1
the	1
rapt	1
religious	1
dances	1
of	1
the	1
Persians	1
and	1
the	1
Arabs,	1
Again,	1
at	1
Eleusis,	1
home	1
of	1
Ceres,	1
I	1
see	1
the	1
modern	1
Greeks	1
dancing,	1
I	1
hear	1
them	1

again	1
the	1
wild	1
old	1
Corybantian	1
dance,	1
the	1
performers	1
wounding	1
each	1
other,	1
I	1
see	1
the	1
Roman	1
youth	1
to	1
the	1
shrill	1
sound	1
of	1
flageolets	1
throwing	1
and	1
catching	1
their	1

As	1
they	1
fall	1
on	1
their	1

rise	1
again.	1
I	1
hear	1
from	1
the	1
Mussulman	1
mosque	1
the	1
muezzin	1

I	1
see	1
the	1
worshippers	1
within,	1
nor	1

sermon,	1

nor	1
word,	1
But	1
silent,	1
strange,	1
devout,	1
rais'd,	1
glowing	1
heads,	1
ecstatic	1
faces.	1
I	1
hear	1
the	1
Egyptian	1
harp	1
of	1
many	1
strings,	1
The	1
primitive	1
chants	1
of	1
the	1
Nile	1
boatmen,	1
The	1
sacred	1
imperial	1

of	1
China,	1
To	1
the	1

of	1
the	1

Or	1

me,	1
Europe	1

inflates	1
me,	1
To	1
organs	1

and	1

I	1
hear	1
as	1
from	1

concourses	1
of	1
voices,	1
Luther's	1
strong	1
hymn	1
Eine	1

Or	1

The	1

To	1
you	1
a	1

West,	1
Obeisant	1
sends	1
his	1

All	1

lead	1
to	1
thee,	1
But	1
now	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
sound	1
leads	1
o'er	1
all	1
the	1
rest.)	1
I	1
hear	1
the	1
annual	1
singing	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
in	1
St.	1
Paul's	1
cathedral,	1
Or,	1
under	1
the	1
high	1
roof	1
of	1
some	1
colossal	1
hall,	1
the	1
symphonies,	1
oratorios	1
of	1
Beethoven,	1
Handel,	1
or	1
Haydn,	1
The	1
Creation	1
in	1
billows	1
of	1
godhood	1
laves	1
me.	1
Give	1
me	1
to	1
hold	1
all	1
sounds,	1
(I	1
madly	1
struggling	1
cry,)	1
Fill	1
me	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
voices	1
of	1
the	1
universe,	1
Endow	1
me	1
with	1
their	1
throbbings,	1
Nature's	1
also,	1
The	1

Utter,	1
pour	1
in,	1
for	1
I	1
would	1
take	1
them	1
all!	1
6	1
Then	1
I	1
woke	1
softly,	1
And	1
pausing,	1
questioning	1
awhile	1
the	1
music	1
of	1
my	1
dream,	1
And	1
questioning	1
all	1
those	1
reminiscences,	1
the	1
tempest	1
in	1
its	1
fury,	1
And	1
all	1
the	1

And	1
those	1

And	1
the	1

and	1
the	1

And	1
all	1
the	1
artless	1
plaints	1
of	1
love	1
and	1
grief	1
and	1
death,	1
I	1
said	1
to	1
my	1
silent	1
curious	1
soul	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
bed	1
of	1
the	1
slumber-chamber,	1
Come,	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
found	1

sought	1
so	1
long,	1
Let	1
us	1

Cheerfully	1

walking	1
the	1
world,	1
the	1
real,	1
Nourish'd	1
henceforth	1
by	1
our	1
celestial	1

And	1
I	1
said,	1
moreover,	1
Haply	1
what	1
thou	1
hast	1
heard	1
O	1
soul	1
was	1
not	1
the	1

You	1

You	1

Passage	1
to	1
India!	1
Lo,	1
soul,	1
seest	1
thou	1
not	1
God's	1
purpose	1
from	1
the	1
first?	1
The	1
earth	1
to	1
be	1
spann'd,	1
connected	1
by	1
network,	1
The	1
races,	1
neighbors,	1
to	1
marry	1
and	1
be	1
given	1
in	1
marriage,	1
The	1
oceans	1
to	1
be	1
cross'd,	1
the	1
distant	1
brought	1
near,	1
The	1
lands	1
to	1
be	1
welded	1
together.	1
A	1
worship	1
new	1
I	1
sing,	1
You	1
captains,	1
voyagers,	1
explorers,	1
yours,	1
You	1
engineers,	1
you	1
architects,	1
machinists,	1
yours,	1
You,	1
not	1
for	1
trade	1
or	1

only,	1
But	1
in	1
God's	1
name,	1
and	1
for	1
thy	1

O	1
soul.	1

Passage	1
to	1
India!	1
Lo	1
soul	1
for	1
thee	1
of	1
tableaus	1
twain,	1
I	1
see	1
in	1
one	1
the	1
Suez	1
canal	1
initiated,	1
open'd,	1
I	1
see	1
the	1
procession	1
of	1
steamships,	1
the	1
Empress	1
Engenie's	1
leading	1
the	1
van,	1
I	1
mark	1
from	1
on	1
deck	1
the	1
strange	1
landscape,	1
the	1
pure	1
sky,	1
the	1
level	1
sand	1
in	1
the	1
distance,	1
I	1
pass	1
swiftly	1
the	1
picturesque	1
groups,	1
the	1
workmen	1
gather'd,	1
The	1
gigantic	1
dredging	1
machines.	1
In	1
one	1
again,	1
different,	1
(yet	1
thine,	1
all	1
thine,	1
O	1
soul,	1
the	1
same,)	1
I	1
see	1
over	1
my	1
own	1
continent	1
the	1
Pacific	1
railroad	1
surmounting	1
every	1
barrier,	1
I	1
see	1
continual	1
trains	1
of	1
cars	1
winding	1
along	1
the	1
Platte	1
carrying	1
freight	1
and	1
passengers,	1
I	1
hear	1
the	1
locomotives	1
rushing	1
and	1
roaring,	1
and	1
the	1
shrill	1
steam-whistle,	1
I	1
hear	1
the	1
echoes	1
reverberate	1
through	1
the	1
grandest	1
scenery	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
I	1
cross	1
the	1
Laramie	1
plains,	1
I	1
note	1
the	1
rocks	1
in	1
grotesque	1
shapes,	1
the	1
buttes,	1
I	1
see	1
the	1
plentiful	1
larkspur	1
and	1
wild	1
onions,	1
the	1
barren,	1
colorless,	1
sage-deserts,	1
I	1
see	1
in	1
glimpses	1
afar	1
or	1
towering	1
immediately	1
above	1
me	1
the	1
great	1
mountains,	1
I	1
see	1
the	1
Wind	1
river	1
and	1
the	1
Wahsatch	1
mountains,	1
I	1
see	1
the	1
Monument	1
mountain	1
and	1
the	1
Eagle's	1
Nest,	1
I	1
pass	1
the	1
Promontory,	1
I	1
ascend	1
the	1
Nevadas,	1
I	1
scan	1
the	1
noble	1
Elk	1
mountain	1
and	1
wind	1
around	1
its	1
base,	1
I	1
see	1
the	1
Humboldt	1
range,	1
I	1
thread	1
the	1
valley	1
and	1
cross	1
the	1
river,	1
I	1
see	1
the	1
clear	1
waters	1
of	1
lake	1
Tahoe,	1
I	1
see	1
forests	1
of	1
majestic	1
pines,	1
Or	1
crossing	1
the	1
great	1
desert,	1
the	1
alkaline	1
plains,	1
I	1
behold	1
enchanting	1
mirages	1
of	1
waters	1
and	1
meadows,	1
Marking	1
through	1
these	1
and	1
after	1
all,	1
in	1
duplicate	1
slender	1
lines,	1
Bridging	1
the	1
three	1
or	1
four	1
thousand	1
miles	1
of	1
land	1
travel,	1
Tying	1
the	1
Eastern	1
to	1
the	1
Western	1
sea,	1
The	1
road	1
between	1
Europe	1
and	1
Asia.	1
(Ah	1
Genoese	1
thy	1
dream!	1
thy	1
dream!	1
Centuries	1
after	1
thou	1
art	1
laid	1
in	1
thy	1

The	1

Passage	1
to	1
India!	1
Struggles	1
of	1
many	1
a	1
captain,	1
tales	1
of	1
many	1
a	1
sailor	1
dead,	1
Over	1
my	1
mood	1
stealing	1
and	1
spreading	1
they	1
come,	1
Like	1
clouds	1
and	1
cloudlets	1
in	1
the	1
unreach'd	1
sky.	1
Along	1
all	1
history,	1
down	1
the	1
slopes,	1
As	1
a	1
rivulet	1
running,	1
sinking	1
now,	1
and	1
now	1
again	1
to	1
the	1
surface	1
rising,	1
A	1
ceaseless	1
thought,	1
a	1
varied	1
train--lo,	1
soul,	1
to	1
thee,	1
thy	1
sight,	1
they	1
rise,	1
The	1
plans,	1
the	1
voyages	1
again,	1
the	1
expeditions;	1
Again	1
Vasco	1
de	1
Gama	1
sails	1
forth,	1
Again	1
the	1
knowledge	1
gain'd,	1
the	1
mariner's	1
compass,	1
Lands	1
found	1
and	1
nations	1
born,	1
thou	1
born	1
America,	1
For	1
purpose	1
vast,	1
man's	1
long	1
probation	1
fill'd,	1
Thou	1
rondure	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
at	1
last	1
accomplish'd.	1
5	1
O	1
vast	1
Rondure,	1
swimming	1
in	1
space,	1
Cover'd	1
all	1
over	1
with	1
visible	1
power	1
and	1
beauty,	1
Alternate	1
light	1
and	1
day	1
and	1
the	1
teeming	1
spiritual	1
darkness,	1
Unspeakable	1
high	1
processions	1
of	1
sun	1
and	1
moon	1
and	1
countless	1
stars	1
above,	1
Below,	1
the	1
manifold	1
grass	1
and	1
waters,	1
animals,	1
mountains,	1
trees,	1
With	1
inscrutable	1
purpose,	1
some	1
hidden	1
prophetic	1
intention,	1
Now	1
first	1
it	1
seems	1
my	1
thought	1
begins	1
to	1
span	1
thee.	1
Down	1
from	1
the	1
gardens	1
of	1
Asia	1
descending	1
radiating,	1
Adam	1
and	1
Eve	1
appear,	1
then	1
their	1
myriad	1
progeny	1
after	1
them,	1
Wandering,	1
yearning,	1
curious,	1
with	1
restless	1
explorations,	1
With	1
questionings,	1
baffled,	1
formless,	1
feverish,	1
with	1
never-happy	1
hearts,	1
With	1
that	1
sad	1
incessant	1
refrain,	1
Wherefore	1
unsatisfied	1
soul?	1
and	1
Whither	1
O	1
mocking	1
life?	1
Ah	1
who	1
shall	1
soothe	1
these	1
feverish	1
children?	1
Who	1
Justify	1
these	1
restless	1
explorations?	1
Who	1
speak	1
the	1
secret	1
of	1
impassive	1
earth?	1
Who	1
bind	1
it	1
to	1
us?	1
what	1
is	1
this	1
separate	1
Nature	1
so	1
unnatural?	1
What	1
is	1
this	1
earth	1
to	1
our	1
affections?	1
(unloving	1
earth,	1
without	1
a	1
throb	1
to	1
answer	1
ours,	1
Cold	1
earth,	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
graves.)	1
Yet	1
soul	1
be	1
sure	1
the	1
first	1
intent	1
remains,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
carried	1
out,	1
Perhaps	1
even	1
now	1
the	1
time	1
has	1
arrived.	1
After	1
the	1
seas	1
are	1
all	1
cross'd,	1
(as	1
they	1
seem	1
already	1
cross'd,)	1
After	1
the	1
great	1
captains	1
and	1
engineers	1
have	1
accomplish'd	1
their	1
work,	1
After	1
the	1
noble	1
inventors,	1
after	1
the	1
scientists,	1
the	1
chemist,	1
the	1
geologist,	1
ethnologist,	1
Finally	1
shall	1
come	1
the	1
poet	1
worthy	1
that	1
name,	1
The	1
true	1
son	1
of	1
God	1
shall	1
come	1
singing	1
his	1
songs.	1
Then	1
not	1
your	1
deeds	1
only	1
O	1
voyagers,	1
O	1
scientists	1
and	1
inventors,	1
shall	1
be	1
justified,	1
All	1
these	1
hearts	1
as	1
of	1
fretted	1
children	1
shall	1
be	1
sooth'd,	1
All	1
affection	1
shall	1
be	1
fully	1
responded	1
to,	1
the	1
secret	1
shall	1
be	1
told,	1
All	1
these	1
separations	1
and	1
gaps	1
shall	1
be	1
taken	1
up	1
and	1
hook'd	1
and	1
link'd	1
together,	1
The	1
whole	1
earth,	1
this	1
cold,	1
impassive,	1
voiceless	1
earth,	1
shall	1
be	1
completely	1
Justified,	1
Trinitas	1
divine	1
shall	1
be	1
gloriously	1
accomplish'd	1
and	1
compacted	1
by	1
the	1
true	1
son	1
of	1
God,	1
the	1
poet,	1
(He	1
shall	1
indeed	1
pass	1
the	1
straits	1
and	1
conquer	1
the	1
mountains,	1
He	1
shall	1
double	1
the	1
cape	1
of	1
Good	1
Hope	1
to	1
some	1
purpose,)	1
Nature	1
and	1
Man	1
shall	1
be	1
disjoin'd	1
and	1
diffused	1
no	1
more,	1
The	1
true	1
son	1
of	1
God	1
shall	1
absolutely	1
fuse	1
them.	1

Year	1

wide-flung	1

Year	1
of	1

Year	1
of	1

The	1

dancing	1
before	1
you,	1
holding	1
a	1

As	1

Passage	1
to	1
India!	1
Cooling	1
airs	1
from	1
Caucasus	1

soothing	1
cradle	1
of	1
man,	1
The	1
river	1
Euphrates	1
flowing,	1
the	1

Lo	1

the	1
retrospect	1
brought	1
forward,	1
The	1
old,	1
most	1
populous,	1
wealthiest	1
of	1
earth's	1
lands,	1
The	1
streams	1
of	1
the	1

behold,	1
resuming	1

The	1

On	1

Thyself	1
O	1
soul	1
that	1
will	1
not	1
brook	1
a	1
challenge.	1
The	1
mediaeval	1
navigators	1
rise	1
before	1
me,	1
The	1
world	1
of	1
1492,	1
with	1
its	1
awaken'd	1
enterprise,	1
Something	1
swelling	1
in	1
humanity	1
now	1
like	1
the	1
sap	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
in	1
spring,	1
The	1

And	1
who	1

Gigantic,	1

thyself	1
a	1

With	1
majestic	1

pious	1
beaming	1
eyes,	1
Spreading	1
around	1
with	1

look	1
of	1
thine	1
a	1
golden	1
world,	1
Enhuing	1
it	1
with	1
gorgeous	1

As	1
the	1

histrion,	1
Down	1
to	1
the	1
footlights	1
walks	1
in	1
some	1
great	1
scena,	1
Dominating	1
the	1
rest	1
I	1
see	1
the	1
Admiral	1
himself,	1
(History's	1
type	1
of	1
courage,	1
action,	1
faith,)	1
Behold	1
him	1
sail	1
from	1
Palos	1
leading	1
his	1
little	1
fleet,	1
His	1
voyage	1
behold,	1
his	1
return,	1
his	1
great	1
fame,	1
His	1
misfortunes,	1
calumniators,	1
behold	1
him	1
a	1
prisoner,	1
chain'd,	1
Behold	1
his	1
dejection,	1
poverty,	1
death.	1
(Curious	1
in	1
time	1
I	1
stand,	1
noting	1
the	1
efforts	1
of	1
heroes,	1
Is	1
the	1
deferment	1
long?	1
bitter	1
the	1
slander,	1
poverty,	1
death?	1
Lies	1
the	1
seed	1
unreck'd	1

lo,	1
to	1
God's	1
due	1
occasion,	1
Uprising	1
in	1
the	1
night,	1
it	1
sprouts,	1
blooms,	1
And	1
fills	1
the	1

with	1

Passage	1
indeed	1
O	1
soul	1
to	1
primal	1
thought,	1
Not	1
lands	1
and	1
seas	1
alone,	1
thy	1
own	1
clear	1
freshness,	1
The	1
young	1
maturity	1
of	1
brood	1
and	1
bloom,	1
To	1
realms	1
of	1
budding	1
bibles.	1
O	1
soul,	1
repressless,	1
I	1
with	1
thee	1
and	1
thou	1
with	1
me,	1
Thy	1
circumnavigation	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
begin,	1
Of	1
man,	1
the	1
voyage	1
of	1
his	1
mind's	1
return,	1
To	1
reason's	1
early	1
paradise,	1
Back,	1
back	1
to	1
wisdom's	1
birth,	1
to	1
innocent	1
intuitions,	1
Again	1
with	1
fair	1
creation.	1
8	1
O	1
we	1
can	1
wait	1
no	1
longer,	1
We	1
too	1
take	1
ship	1
O	1
soul,	1
Joyous	1
we	1
too	1
launch	1
out	1
on	1
trackless	1
seas,	1
Fearless	1
for	1
unknown	1
shores	1
on	1
waves	1
of	1
ecstasy	1
to	1
sail,	1
Amid	1
the	1
wafting	1
winds,	1
(thou	1
pressing	1
me	1
to	1
thee,	1
I	1
thee	1
to	1
me,	1
O	1
soul,)	1
Caroling	1
free,	1
singing	1
our	1
song	1
of	1
God,	1
Chanting	1
our	1
chant	1
of	1
pleasant	1
exploration.	1
With	1
laugh	1
and	1
many	1
a	1
kiss,	1
(Let	1
others	1
deprecate,	1
let	1
others	1
weep	1
for	1
sin,	1
remorse,	1
humiliation,)	1
O	1
soul	1
thou	1
pleasest	1
me,	1
I	1
thee.	1
Ah	1
more	1
than	1
any	1
priest	1
O	1
soul	1
we	1
too	1
believe	1
in	1
God,	1
But	1
with	1
the	1
mystery	1
of	1
God	1
we	1
dare	1
not	1
dally.	1
O	1
soul	1
thou	1
pleasest	1
me,	1
I	1
thee,	1
Sailing	1
these	1
seas	1
or	1
on	1
the	1
hills,	1
or	1
waking	1
in	1
the	1
night,	1
Thoughts,	1
silent	1
thoughts,	1
of	1
Time	1
and	1
Space	1
and	1
Death,	1
like	1
waters	1
flowing,	1
Bear	1
me	1
indeed	1
as	1
through	1
the	1
regions	1
infinite,	1
Whose	1
air	1
I	1
breathe,	1
whose	1
ripples	1
hear,	1
lave	1
me	1
all	1
over,	1
Bathe	1
me	1
O	1
God	1
in	1

those	1
journeymen	1
divine,	1
Only	1
from	1
me	1
can	1
they	1
hide	1
nothing,	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
if	1
they	1
could,	1
I	1
reckon	1
I	1
am	1
their	1
boss	1
and	1
they	1
make	1
me	1
a	1
pet	1
besides,	1
And	1
surround	1
me	1
and	1
lead	1
me	1
and	1
run	1
ahead	1
when	1
I	1
walk,	1
To	1
lift	1
their	1
cunning	1
covers	1
to	1
signify	1
me	1
with	1
stretch'd	1
arms,	1
and	1
resume	1
the	1
way;	1
Onward	1
we	1
move,	1
a	1
gay	1
gang	1
of	1
blackguards!	1
with	1
mirth-shouting	1
music	1
and	1
wild-flapping	1
pennants	1
of	1
joy!	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
actor,	1
the	1
actress,	1
the	1
voter,	1
the	1
politician,	1
The	1
emigrant	1
and	1
the	1
exile,	1
the	1
criminal	1
that	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
box,	1
He	1
who	1
has	1
been	1
famous	1
and	1
he	1
who	1
shall	1
be	1
famous	1
after	1
to-day,	1
The	1
stammerer,	1
the	1
well-form'd	1
person,	1
the	1
wasted	1
or	1
feeble	1
person.	1
I	1
am	1
she	1
who	1
adorn'd	1
herself	1
and	1
folded	1
her	1
hair	1
expectantly,	1
My	1
truant	1
lover	1
has	1
come,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
dark.	1
Double	1
yourself	1
and	1
receive	1
me	1
darkness,	1
Receive	1
me	1
and	1
my	1
lover	1
too,	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
let	1
me	1
go	1
without	1
him.	1
I	1
roll	1
myself	1
upon	1
you	1
as	1
upon	1
a	1
bed,	1
I	1
resign	1
myself	1
to	1
the	1
dusk.	1
He	1
whom	1
I	1
call	1
answers	1
me	1
and	1
takes	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
my	1
lover,	1
He	1
rises	1
with	1
me	1
silently	1
from	1
the	1
bed.	1
Darkness,	1
you	1
are	1
gentler	1
than	1
my	1
lover,	1
his	1
flesh	1
was	1
sweaty	1
and	1
panting,	1
I	1
feel	1
the	1
hot	1
moisture	1
yet	1
that	1
he	1
left	1
me.	1
My	1
hands	1
are	1
spread	1
forth,	1
I	1
pass	1
them	1
in	1
all	1
directions,	1
I	1
would	1
sound	1
up	1
the	1
shadowy	1
shore	1
to	1
which	1
you	1
are	1
journeying.	1
Be	1
careful	1
darkness!	1
already	1
what	1
was	1
it	1
touch'd	1
me?	1
I	1
thought	1
my	1
lover	1
had	1
gone,	1
else	1
darkness	1
and	1
he	1
are	1
one,	1
I	1
hear	1
the	1
heart-beat,	1
I	1
follow,	1
I	1
fade	1
away.	1
2	1
I	1
descend	1
my	1
western	1
course,	1
my	1
sinews	1
are	1
flaccid,	1
Perfume	1
and	1
youth	1
course	1
through	1
me	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
their	1
wake.	1
It	1
is	1
my	1
face	1
yellow	1
and	1
wrinkled	1
instead	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
woman's,	1
I	1
sit	1
low	1
in	1
a	1
straw-bottom	1
chair	1
and	1
carefully	1
darn	1
my	1
grandson's	1
stockings.	1
It	1
is	1
I	1
too,	1
the	1
sleepless	1
widow	1
looking	1
out	1
on	1
the	1
winter	1
midnight,	1
I	1
see	1
the	1
sparkles	1
of	1
starshine	1
on	1
the	1
icy	1
and	1
pallid	1
earth.	1
A	1
shroud	1
I	1
see	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
shroud,	1
I	1
wrap	1
a	1
body	1
and	1
lie	1
in	1
the	1
coffin,	1
It	1
is	1
dark	1
here	1
under	1
ground,	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
evil	1
or	1
pain	1
here,	1
it	1
is	1
blank	1
here,	1
for	1
reasons.	1
(It	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
every	1
thing	1
in	1
the	1
light	1
and	1
air	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
happy,	1
Whoever	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
his	1
coffin	1
and	1
the	1
dark	1
grave	1
let	1
him	1
know	1
he	1
has	1
enough.)	1
3	1
I	1
see	1
a	1
beautiful	1
gigantic	1
swimmer	1
swimming	1
naked	1
through	1
the	1
eddies	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
His	1
brown	1
hair	1
lies	1
close	1
and	1
even	1
to	1
his	1
head,	1
he	1
strikes	1
out	1
with	1
courageous	1
arms,	1
he	1
urges	1
himself	1
with	1
his	1
legs,	1
I	1
see	1
his	1
white	1
body,	1
I	1
see	1
his	1
undaunted	1
eyes,	1
I	1
hate	1
the	1
swift-running	1
eddies	1
that	1
would	1
dash	1
him	1
head-foremost	1
on	1
the	1
rocks.	1
What	1
are	1
you	1
doing	1
you	1
ruffianly	1
red-trickled	1
waves?	1
Will	1
you	1
kill	1
the	1
courageous	1
giant?	1
will	1
you	1
kill	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
prime	1
of	1
his	1
middle	1
age?	1
Steady	1
and	1
long	1
he	1
struggles,	1
He	1
is	1
baffled,	1
bang'd,	1
bruis'd,	1
he	1
holds	1
out	1
while	1
his	1
strength	1
holds	1
out,	1
The	1
slapping	1
eddies	1
are	1
spotted	1
with	1
his	1
blood,	1
they	1
bear	1
him	1
away,	1
they	1
roll	1
him,	1
swing	1
him,	1
turn	1
him,	1
His	1
beautiful	1
body	1
is	1
borne	1
in	1
the	1
circling	1
eddies,	1
it	1
is	1
continually	1
bruis'd	1
on	1
rocks,	1
Swiftly	1
and	1
ought	1
of	1
sight	1
is	1
borne	1
the	1
brave	1
corpse.	1
4	1
I	1
turn	1
but	1
do	1
not	1
extricate	1
myself,	1
Confused,	1
a	1
past-reading,	1
another,	1
but	1
with	1
darkness	1
yet.	1
The	1
beach	1
is	1
cut	1
by	1
the	1
razory	1
ice-wind,	1
the	1
wreck-guns	1
sound,	1
The	1
tempest	1
lulls,	1
the	1
moon	1
comes	1
floundering	1
through	1
the	1
drifts.	1
I	1
look	1
where	1
the	1
ship	1
helplessly	1
heads	1
end	1
on,	1
I	1
hear	1
the	1
burst	1
as	1
she	1
strikes,	1
I	1
hear	1
the	1
howls	1
of	1
dismay,	1
they	1
grow	1
fainter	1
and	1
fainter.	1
I	1
cannot	1
aid	1
with	1
my	1
wringing	1
fingers,	1
I	1
can	1
but	1
rush	1
to	1
the	1
surf	1
and	1
let	1
it	1
drench	1
me	1
and	1
freeze	1
upon	1
me.	1
I	1
search	1
with	1
the	1
crowd,	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
company	1
is	1
wash'd	1
to	1
us	1
alive,	1
In	1
the	1
morning	1
I	1
help	1
pick	1
up	1
the	1
dead	1
and	1
lay	1
them	1
in	1
rows	1
in	1
a	1
barn.	1
5	1
Now	1
of	1
the	1
older	1
war-days,	1
the	1
defeat	1
at	1
Brooklyn,	1
Washington	1
stands	1
inside	1
the	1
lines,	1
he	1
stands	1
on	1
the	1
intrench'd	1
hills	1
amid	1
a	1
crowd	1
of	1
officers.	1
His	1
face	1
is	1
cold	1
and	1
damp,	1
he	1
cannot	1
repress	1
the	1
weeping	1
drops,	1
He	1
lifts	1
the	1
glass	1
perpetually	1
to	1
his	1
eyes,	1
the	1
color	1
is	1
blanch'd	1
from	1
his	1
cheeks,	1
He	1
sees	1
the	1
slaughter	1
of	1
the	1
southern	1
braves	1
confided	1
to	1
him	1
by	1
their	1
parents.	1
The	1
same	1
at	1
last	1
and	1
at	1
last	1
when	1
peace	1
is	1
declared,	1
He	1
stands	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
tavern,	1
the	1
well-belov'd	1
soldiers	1
all	1
pass	1
through,	1
The	1
officers	1
speechless	1
and	1
slow	1
draw	1
near	1
in	1
their	1
turns,	1
The	1
chief	1
encircles	1
their	1
necks	1
with	1
his	1
arm	1
and	1
kisses	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
cheek,	1
He	1
kisses	1
lightly	1
the	1
wet	1
cheeks	1
one	1
after	1
another,	1
he	1
shakes	1
hands	1
and	1
bids	1
good-by	1
to	1
the	1
army.	1
6	1
Now	1
what	1
my	1
mother	1
told	1
me	1
one	1
day	1
as	1
we	1
sat	1
at	1
dinner	1
together,	1
Of	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
nearly	1
grown	1
girl	1
living	1
home	1
with	1
her	1
parents	1
on	1
the	1
old	1
homestead.	1
A	1
red	1
squaw	1
came	1
one	1
breakfast-time	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
homestead,	1
On	1
her	1
back	1
she	1
carried	1
a	1
bundle	1
of	1
rushes	1
for	1
rush-bottoming	1
chairs,	1
Her	1
hair,	1
straight,	1
shiny,	1
coarse,	1
black,	1
profuse,	1
half-envelop'd	1
her	1
face,	1
Her	1
step	1
was	1
free	1
and	1
elastic,	1
and	1
her	1
voice	1
sounded	1
exquisitely	1
as	1
she	1
spoke.	1
My	1
mother	1
look'd	1
in	1
delight	1
and	1
amazement	1
at	1
the	1
stranger,	1
She	1
look'd	1
at	1
the	1
freshness	1
of	1
her	1
tall-borne	1
face	1
and	1
full	1
and	1
pliant	1
limbs,	1
The	1
more	1
she	1
look'd	1
upon	1
her	1
she	1
loved	1
her,	1
Never	1
before	1
had	1
she	1
seen	1
such	1
wonderful	1
beauty	1
and	1
purity,	1
She	1
made	1
her	1
sit	1
on	1
a	1
bench	1
by	1
the	1
jamb	1
of	1
the	1
fireplace,	1
she	1
cook'd	1
food	1
for	1
her,	1
She	1
had	1
no	1
work	1
to	1
give	1
her,	1
but	1
she	1
gave	1
her	1
remembrance	1
and	1
fondness.	1
The	1
red	1
squaw	1
staid	1
all	1
the	1
forenoon,	1
and	1
toward	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
afternoon	1
she	1
went	1
away,	1
O	1
my	1
mother	1
was	1
loth	1
to	1
have	1
her	1
go	1
away,	1
All	1
the	1
week	1
she	1
thought	1
of	1
her,	1
she	1
watch'd	1
for	1
her	1
many	1
a	1
month,	1
She	1
remember'd	1
her	1
many	1
a	1
winter	1
and	1
many	1
a	1
summer,	1
But	1
the	1
red	1
squaw	1
never	1
came	1
nor	1
was	1
heard	1
of	1
there	1
again.	1
7	1
A	1
show	1
of	1
the	1
summer	1
softness--a	1
contact	1
of	1
something	1
unseen--an	1
amour	1
of	1
the	1
light	1
and	1
air,	1
I	1
am	1
jealous	1
and	1
overwhelm'd	1
with	1
friendliness,	1
And	1
will	1
go	1
gallivant	1
with	1
the	1
light	1
and	1
air	1
myself.	1
O	1
love	1
and	1
summer,	1
you	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
dreams	1
and	1
in	1
me,	1
Autumn	1
and	1
winter	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
dreams,	1
the	1
farmer	1
goes	1
with	1
his	1
thrift,	1
The	1
droves	1
and	1
crops	1
increase,	1
the	1
barns	1
are	1
well-fill'd.	1
Elements	1
merge	1
in	1
the	1
night,	1
ships	1
make	1
tacks	1
in	1
the	1
dreams,	1
The	1
sailor	1
sails,	1
the	1
exile	1
returns	1
home,	1
The	1
fugitive	1
returns	1
unharm'd,	1
the	1
immigrant	1
is	1
back	1
beyond	1
months	1
and	1
years,	1
The	1
poor	1
Irishman	1
lives	1
in	1
the	1
simple	1
house	1
of	1
his	1
childhood	1
with	1
the	1
well	1
known	1
neighbors	1
and	1
faces,	1
They	1
warmly	1
welcome	1
him,	1
he	1
is	1
barefoot	1
again,	1
he	1
forgets	1
he	1
is	1
well	1
off,	1
The	1
Dutchman	1
voyages	1
home,	1
and	1
the	1
Scotchman	1
and	1
Welshman	1

of	1
the	1
Mediterranean	1

To	1
every	1

of	1
England,	1

The	1
Swiss	1
foots	1

his	1

the	1
Prussian	1

the	1

The	1
Swede	1

and	1
the	1
Dane	1
and	1
Norwegian	1
return.	1
The	1
homeward	1
bound	1
and	1
the	1
outward	1
bound,	1
The	1
beautiful	1
lost	1
swimmer,	1
the	1
ennuye,	1
the	1
onanist,	1
the	1
female	1
that	1
loves	1
unrequited,	1
the	1
money-maker,	1
The	1
actor	1
and	1
actress,	1
those	1
through	1
with	1
their	1
parts	1
and	1
those	1
waiting	1
to	1
commence,	1
The	1
affectionate	1
boy,	1
the	1
husband	1
and	1
wife,	1
the	1
voter,	1
the	1
nominee	1
that	1
is	1
chosen	1
and	1
the	1
nominee	1
that	1
has	1
fail'd,	1
The	1
great	1
already	1
known	1
and	1
the	1
great	1
any	1
time	1
after	1
to-day,	1
The	1
stammerer,	1
the	1
sick,	1
the	1
perfect-form'd,	1
the	1
homely,	1
The	1
criminal	1
that	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
box,	1
the	1
judge	1
that	1
sat	1
and	1
sentenced	1
him,	1
the	1
fluent	1
lawyers,	1
the	1
jury,	1
the	1
audience,	1
The	1
laugher	1
and	1
weeper,	1
the	1
dancer,	1
the	1
midnight	1
widow,	1
the	1
red	1
squaw,	1
The	1
consumptive,	1
the	1
erysipalite,	1
the	1
idiot,	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
wrong'd,	1
The	1
antipodes,	1
and	1
every	1
one	1
between	1
this	1
and	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
dark,	1
I	1
swear	1
they	1
are	1
averaged	1
now--one	1
is	1
no	1
better	1
than	1
the	1
other,	1
The	1
night	1
and	1
sleep	1
have	1
liken'd	1
them	1
and	1
restored	1
them.	1
I	1
swear	1
they	1
are	1
all	1
beautiful,	1
Every	1
one	1
that	1
sleeps	1
is	1
beautiful,	1
every	1
thing	1
in	1
the	1
dim	1
light	1
is	1
beautiful,	1
The	1
wildest	1
and	1
bloodiest	1
is	1
over,	1
and	1
all	1
is	1
peace.	1
Peace	1
is	1
always	1
beautiful,	1
The	1
myth	1
of	1
heaven	1
indicates	1
peace	1
and	1
night.	1
The	1
myth	1
of	1
heaven	1
indicates	1
the	1
soul,	1
The	1
soul	1
is	1
always	1
beautiful,	1
it	1
appears	1
more	1
or	1
it	1
appears	1
less,	1
it	1
comes	1
or	1
it	1
lags	1
behind,	1
It	1
comes	1
from	1
its	1
embower'd	1
garden	1
and	1
looks	1
pleasantly	1
on	1
itself	1
and	1
encloses	1
the	1
world,	1
Perfect	1
and	1
clean	1
the	1
genitals	1
previously	1
jetting,and	1
perfect	1
and	1
clean	1
the	1
womb	1
cohering,	1
The	1
head	1
well-grown	1
proportion'd	1
and	1
plumb,	1
and	1
the	1
bowels	1
and	1
joints	1
proportion'd	1
and	1
plumb.	1
The	1
soul	1
is	1
always	1
beautiful,	1
The	1
universe	1
is	1
duly	1
in	1
order,	1
every	1
thing	1
is	1
in	1
its	1
place,	1
What	1
has	1
arrived	1
is	1
in	1
its	1
place	1
and	1
what	1
waits	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
its	1
place,	1
The	1
twisted	1
skull	1
waits,	1
the	1
watery	1
or	1
rotten	1
blood	1
waits,	1
The	1
child	1
of	1
the	1
glutton	1
or	1
venerealee	1
waits	1
long,	1
and	1
the	1
child	1
of	1
the	1
drunkard	1
waits	1
long,	1
and	1
the	1
drunkard	1
himself	1
waits	1
long,	1
The	1
sleepers	1
that	1

minute--no	1

is	1
done,	1
He	1
is	1
decently	1
put	1

there	1
any	1

more?	1

The	1
markets,	1
the	1

the	1

wages,	1
to	1
think	1
what	1
account	1
they	1
are	1
through	1
our	1
nights	1

days,	1
To	1

that	1
other	1
working-men	1
will	1
make	1
just	1
as	1
great	1
account	1
of	1
them,	1
yet	1
we	1
make	1
little	1
or	1
no	1
account.	1
The	1
vulgar	1
and	1
the	1
refined,	1
what	1
you	1
call	1
sin	1
and	1
what	1
you	1
call	1
goodness,	1
to	1
think	1
how	1
wide	1
a	1
difference,	1
To	1
think	1
the	1
difference	1
will	1
still	1
continue	1
to	1
others,	1
yet	1
we	1
lie	1
beyond	1
the	1
difference.	1
To	1
think	1
how	1
much	1
pleasure	1
there	1
is,	1
Do	1
you	1
enjoy	1
yourself	1
in	1
the	1
city?	1
or	1
engaged	1
in	1
business?	1
or	1
planning	1
a	1
nomination	1
and	1
election?	1
or	1
with	1
your	1
wife	1
and	1
family?	1
Or	1
with	1
your	1
mother	1
and	1
sisters?	1
or	1
in	1
womanly	1
housework?	1
or	1
the	1
beautiful	1
maternal	1
cares?	1
These	1
also	1
flow	1
onward	1
to	1
others,	1
you	1
and	1
I	1
flow	1
onward,	1
But	1
in	1
due	1
time	1
you	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
take	1
less	1
interest	1
in	1
them.	1
Your	1
farm,	1
profits,	1
crops--to	1
think	1
how	1
engross'd	1
you	1
are,	1
To	1
think	1
there	1
will	1
still	1
be	1
farms,	1
profits,	1
crops,	1
yet	1
for	1
you	1
of	1
what	1
avail?	1
6	1
What	1
will	1
be	1
will	1
be	1
well,	1
for	1
what	1
is	1
is	1
well,	1
To	1
take	1
interest	1
is	1
well,	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
take	1
interest	1
shall	1
be	1
well.	1
The	1
domestic	1
joys,	1
the	1
dally	1
housework	1
or	1
business,	1
the	1
building	1
of	1
houses,	1
are	1
not	1
phantasms,	1
they	1
have	1
weight,	1
form,	1
location,	1
Farms,	1
profits,	1
crops,	1
markets,	1
wages,	1
government,	1
are	1
none	1
of	1
them	1
phantasms,	1
The	1
difference	1
between	1
sin	1
and	1
goodness	1
is	1
no	1
delusion,	1
The	1
earth	1
is	1
not	1
an	1
echo,	1
man	1
and	1
his	1
life	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
things	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
are	1
well-consider'd.	1
You	1
are	1
not	1
thrown	1
to	1
the	1
winds,	1
you	1
gather	1
certainly	1
and	1
safely	1
around	1
yourself,	1
Yourself!	1
yourself!.	1
yourself,	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever!	1
7	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
diffuse	1
you	1
that	1
you	1
were	1
born	1
of	1
your	1
mother	1
and	1
father,	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
identify	1
you,	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
that	1
you	1
should	1
be	1
undecided,	1
but	1
that	1
you	1
should	1
be	1
decided,	1
Something	1
long	1
preparing	1
and	1
formless	1
is	1
arrived	1
and	1
form'd	1
in	1
you,	1
You	1
are	1
henceforth	1
secure,	1
whatever	1
comes	1
or	1
goes.	1
The	1
threads	1
that	1
were	1
spun	1
are	1
gather'd,	1
the	1
wet	1
crosses	1
the	1
warp,	1
the	1
pattern	1
is	1
systematic.	1
The	1
preparations	1
have	1
every	1
one	1
been	1
justified,	1
The	1
orchestra	1
have	1
sufficiently	1
tuned	1
their	1
instruments,	1
the	1
baton	1
has	1
given	1
the	1
signal.	1
The	1
guest	1
that	1
was	1
coming,	1
he	1
waited	1
long,	1
he	1
is	1
now	1
housed,	1
He	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
beautiful	1
and	1
happy,	1
he	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
to	1
look	1
upon	1
and	1
be	1
with	1
is	1
enough.	1
The	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
past	1
cannot	1
be	1
eluded,	1
The	1
law	1
of	1
the	1

The	1

But	1
there	1
is	1
more	1
account	1
than	1

there	1
is	1
strict	1

of	1
all.	1
The	1
interminable	1

are	1
not	1
nothing,	1
The	1

Africa	1
and	1
Asia	1
are	1
not	1
nothing,	1
The	1
perpetual	1
successions	1
of	1
shallow	1
people	1
are	1
not	1
nothing	1
as	1
they	1
go.	1
Of	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
these	1
things,	1
I	1
have	1
dream'd	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
changed	1
so	1
much,	1
nor	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
us	1
changed,	1
I	1
have	1
dream'd	1
that	1
heroes	1
and	1
good-doers	1
shall	1
be	1
under	1
the	1
present	1
and	1
past	1
law,	1
And	1
that	1
murderers,	1
drunkards,	1
liars,	1
shall	1
be	1
under	1
the	1
present	1
and	1
past	1
law,	1
For	1
I	1
have	1
dream'd	1
that	1
the	1
law	1
they	1
are	1
under	1
now	1
is	1
enough.	1
And	1
I	1
have	1
dream'd	1
that	1
the	1
purpose	1
and	1
essence	1
of	1
the	1
known	1
life,	1
the	1
transient,	1
Is	1
to	1
form	1
and	1
decide	1
identity	1
for	1
the	1
unknown	1
life,	1
the	1
permanent.	1
If	1
all	1
came	1
but	1
to	1
ashes	1
of	1
dung,	1
If	1
maggots	1
and	1
rats	1
ended	1
us,	1
then	1
Alarum!	1
for	1
we	1
are	1
betray'd,	1
Then	1
indeed	1
suspicion	1
of	1
death.	1
Do	1
you	1
suspect	1
death?	1
if	1
I	1
were	1
to	1
suspect	1
death	1
I	1
should	1
die	1
now,	1
Do	1
you	1
think	1
I	1
could	1
walk	1
pleasantly	1
and	1
well-suited	1
toward	1
annihilation?	1
Pleasantly	1
and	1
well-suited	1
I	1
walk,	1
Whither	1
I	1
walk	1
I	1
cannot	1
define,	1
but	1
I	1
know	1
it	1
is	1
good,	1
The	1
whole	1
universe	1
indicates	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
good,	1
The	1
past	1
and	1
the	1
present	1
indicate	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
good.	1
How	1
beautiful	1
and	1
perfect	1
are	1
the	1
animals!	1
How	1
perfect	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
the	1
minutest	1
thing	1
upon	1
it!	1
What	1
is	1
called	1
good	1
is	1
perfect,	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
called	1
bad	1
is	1
just	1
as	1
perfect,	1
The	1
vegetables	1
and	1
minerals	1
are	1
all	1
perfect,	1
and	1
the	1
imponderable	1
fluids	1
perfect;	1
Slowly	1
and	1
surely	1
they	1
have	1
pass'd	1
on	1
to	1
this,	1
and	1
slowly	1
and	1
surely	1
they	1
yet	1
pass	1
on.	1

I	1
swear	1
I	1
think	1
now	1
that	1
every	1
thing	1
without	1
exception	1
has	1
an	1
eternal	1
soul!	1
The	1
trees	1
have,	1
rooted	1
in	1
the	1
ground!	1
the	1
weeds	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
have!	1
the	1
animals!	1
I	1
swear	1
I	1
think	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
but	1
immortality!	1
That	1
the	1
exquisite	1
scheme	1
is	1
for	1
it,	1
and	1
the	1
nebulous	1
float	1
is	1
for	1
it,	1
and	1
the	1
cohering	1
is	1
for	1
it!	1
And	1
all	1
preparation	1
is	1
for	1
it--and	1
identity	1
is	1
for	1
it--and	1
life	1
and	1
materials	1
are	1
altogether	1
for	1
it!	1

down,	1
Of	1

gather'd	1
together	1
on	1

pale,	1
heroic,	1
waiting	1
the	1
moment	1
that	1
draws	1
so	1
close--O	1
the	1
moment!	1
A	1
huge	1
sob--a	1
few	1
bubbles--the	1
white	1
foam	1
spirting	1
up--and	1
then	1
the	1
women	1
gone,	1
Sinking	1
there	1
while	1
the	1
passionless	1
wet	1
flows	1
on--and	1
I	1
now	1
pondering,	1
Are	1
those	1
women	1
indeed	1
gone?	1
Are	1

For	1
thee,	1

I'd	1
sow	1
a	1

for	1
thee	1
of	1
endless	1
Nationality,	1
I'd	1
fashion	1
thy	1
ensemble	1
including	1
body	1
and	1

I'd	1
show	1
away	1
ahead	1
thy	1

and	1
how	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
accomplish'd.	1
The	1
paths	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
I	1
seek	1
to	1
make,	1
But	1
leave	1
to	1
those	1
to	1
come	1
the	1
house	1
itself.	1
Belief	1
I	1
sing,	1
and	1
preparation;	1
As	1
Life	1
and	1
Nature	1
are	1
not	1
great	1
with	1
reference	1
to	1
the	1
present	1
only,	1
But	1
greater	1
still	1
from	1
what	1
is	1
yet	1
to	1
come,	1
Out	1
of	1
that	1
formula	1
for	1
thee	1
I	1
sing.	1

The	1

I'd	1

thee	1
not,	1

Nor	1

nor	1
the	1
classics,	1
nor	1
perfume	1
of	1
foreign	1
court	1
or	1

But	1
an	1
odor	1
I'd	1
bring	1
as	1
from	1
forests	1
of	1
pine	1
in	1
Maine,	1
or	1
breath	1
of	1
an	1
Illinois	1

With	1

from	1
Texas	1

Florida's	1

Or	1
the	1
Saguenay's	1
black	1

or	1
the	1
wide	1

of	1
Huron,	1
With	1
presentment	1
of	1
Yellowstone's	1
scenes,	1
or	1
Yosemite,	1
And	1
murmuring	1
under,	1
pervading	1
all,	1
I'd	1
bring	1
the	1
rustling	1
sea-sound,	1
That	1
endlessly	1
sounds	1
from	1
the	1
two	1
Great	1
Seas	1
of	1

Thy	1

Sauntering	1

faces!	1
Faces	1
of	1
friendship,	1
precision,	1

suavity,	1
ideality,	1
The	1
spiritual-prescient	1
face,	1
the	1
always	1
welcome	1
common	1
benevolent	1
face,	1
The	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
singing	1
of	1

the	1
grand	1
faces	1
of	1
natural	1
lawyers	1
and	1
judges	1
broad	1
at	1
the	1
back-top,	1
The	1
faces	1
of	1
hunters	1
and	1
fishers	1
bulged	1
at	1
the	1
brows,	1
the	1
shaved	1
blanch'd	1
faces	1
of	1
orthodox	1
citizens,	1
The	1
pure,	1
extravagant,	1
yearning,	1
questioning	1
artist's	1
face,	1
The	1
ugly	1
face	1
of	1
some	1
beautiful	1
soul,	1
the	1
handsome	1
detested	1
or	1
despised	1
face,	1
The	1
sacred	1
faces	1
of	1
infants,	1
the	1
illuminated	1

of	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
many	1
children,	1
The	1
face	1
of	1
an	1
amour,	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
veneration,	1
The	1
face	1
as	1
of	1
a	1
dream,	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
an	1
immobile	1
rock,	1
The	1
face	1
withdrawn	1
of	1
its	1
good	1
and	1
bad,	1
a	1
castrated	1
face,	1
A	1
wild	1
hawk,	1
his	1
wings	1
clipp'd	1
by	1
the	1
clipper,	1
A	1
stallion	1
that	1
yielded	1
at	1
last	1
to	1
the	1
thongs	1
and	1
knife	1
of	1
the	1

Sauntering	1
the	1
pavement	1
thus,	1
or	1
crossing	1
the	1
ceaseless	1
ferry,	1
faces	1
and	1
faces	1
and	1
faces,	1
I	1
see	1
them	1
and	1
complain	1
not,	1
and	1
am	1
content	1
with	1
all.	1
2	1
Do	1
you	1
suppose	1
I	1
could	1
be	1
content	1
with	1
all	1
if	1
I	1
thought	1
them	1
their	1
own	1
finale?	1
This	1
now	1
is	1
too	1
lamentable	1
a	1
face	1
for	1
a	1
man,	1
Some	1
abject	1
louse	1
asking	1
leave	1
to	1
be,	1
cringing	1
for	1
it,	1
Some	1
milk-nosed	1
maggot	1
blessing	1
what	1
lets	1
it	1
wrig	1
to	1
its	1
hole.	1
This	1
face	1
is	1
a	1
dog's	1
snout	1
sniffing	1
for	1
garbage,	1
Snakes	1
nest	1
in	1
that	1
mouth,	1
I	1
hear	1
the	1
sibilant	1
threat.	1
This	1
face	1
is	1
a	1
haze	1
more	1
chill	1
than	1
the	1
arctic	1
sea,	1
Its	1
sleepy	1
and	1
wobbling	1
icebergs	1
crunch	1
as	1
they	1
go.	1
This	1
is	1
a	1
face	1
of	1
bitter	1
herbs,	1
this	1
an	1
emetic,	1
they	1
need	1
no	1
label,	1
And	1
more	1
of	1
the	1
drug-shelf,	1
laudanum,	1
caoutchouc,	1
or	1
hog's-lard.	1
This	1
face	1
is	1
an	1
epilepsy,	1
its	1
wordless	1
tongue	1
gives	1
out	1
the	1
unearthly	1
cry,	1
Its	1
veins	1
down	1
the	1
neck	1
distend,	1
its	1
eyes	1
roll	1
till	1
they	1
show	1
nothing	1
but	1
their	1
whites,	1
Its	1
teeth	1
grit,	1
the	1
palms	1
of	1
the	1
hands	1
are	1
cut	1
by	1
the	1
turn'd-in	1
nails,	1
The	1
man	1
falls	1
struggling	1
and	1
foaming	1
to	1
the	1
ground,	1
while	1
he	1
speculates	1
well.	1
This	1
face	1
is	1
bitten	1
by	1
vermin	1
and	1
worms,	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
some	1
murderer's	1
knife	1
with	1
a	1
half-pull'd	1
scabbard.	1
This	1
face	1
owes	1
to	1
the	1
sexton	1
his	1
dismalest	1
fee,	1
An	1
unceasing	1
death-bell	1
tolls	1
there.	1
3	1
Features	1
of	1
my	1
equals	1
would	1
you	1
trick	1
me	1
with	1
your	1
creas'd	1
and	1
cadaverous	1
march?	1
Well,	1
you	1
cannot	1
trick	1
me.	1
I	1
see	1
your	1
rounded	1
never-erased	1
flow,	1
I	1
see	1
'neath	1
the	1
rims	1
of	1
your	1
haggard	1
and	1
mean	1
disguises.	1
Splay	1
and	1
twist	1
as	1
you	1
like,	1
poke	1
with	1
the	1
tangling	1
fores	1
of	1
fishes	1
or	1
rats,	1
You'll	1
be	1
unmuzzled,	1
you	1
certainly	1
will.	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
smear'd	1
and	1
slobbering	1
idiot	1
they	1
had	1
at	1
the	1
asylum,	1
And	1
I	1
knew	1
for	1
my	1
consolation	1
what	1
they	1
knew	1
not,	1
I	1
knew	1
of	1
the	1
agents	1
that	1
emptied	1
and	1
broke	1
my	1
brother,	1
The	1
same	1
wait	1
to	1
clear	1
the	1
rubbish	1
from	1
the	1
fallen	1
tenement,	1
And	1
I	1
shall	1
look	1
again	1
in	1
a	1
score	1
or	1
two	1
of	1
ages,	1
And	1
I	1
shall	1
meet	1
the	1
real	1
landlord	1
perfect	1
and	1
unharm'd,	1
every	1
inch	1
as	1
good	1
as	1
myself.	1

The	1
Lord	1
advances,	1
and	1
yet	1
advances,	1
Always	1
the	1
shadow	1
in	1
front,	1
always	1
the	1
reach'd	1
hand	1
bringing	1
up	1
the	1
laggards.	1
Out	1
of	1
this	1
face	1
emerge	1
banners	1
and	1
horses--O	1
superb!	1
I	1
see	1
what	1
is	1
coming,	1
I	1
see	1
the	1
high	1
pioneer-caps,	1
see	1
staves	1
of	1
runners	1
clearing	1
the	1
way,	1
I	1
hear	1
victorious	1
drums.	1
This	1
face	1
is	1
a	1
life-boat,	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
face	1
commanding	1
and	1
bearded,	1
it	1
asks	1
no	1
odds	1
of	1
the	1
rest,	1
This	1
face	1
is	1
flavor'd	1
fruit	1
ready	1
for	1
eating,	1
This	1
face	1
of	1
a	1
healthy	1
honest	1
boy	1
is	1
the	1
programme	1
of	1
all	1
good.	1
These	1
faces	1
bear	1
testimony	1
slumbering	1
or	1
awake,	1
They	1
show	1
their	1
descent	1
from	1
the	1
Master	1
himself.	1
Off	1
the	1
word	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
I	1
except	1
not	1
one--red,	1
white,	1
black,	1
are	1
all	1
deific,	1
In	1
each	1
house	1
is	1
the	1
ovum,	1
it	1
comes	1
forth	1
after	1
a	1
thousand	1
years.	1
Spots	1
or	1
cracks	1
at	1
the	1
windows	1
do	1
not	1
disturb	1
me,	1
Tall	1
and	1
sufficient	1
stand	1
behind	1
and	1
make	1
signs	1
to	1
me,	1
I	1
read	1
the	1
promise	1
and	1
patiently	1
wait.	1
This	1
is	1
a	1
full-grown	1
lily's	1
face,	1
She	1
speaks	1
to	1
the	1
limber-hipp'd	1
man	1
near	1
the	1
garden	1
pickets,	1
Come	1
here	1
she	1
blushingly	1
cries,	1
Come	1
nigh	1
to	1
me	1
limber-hipp'd	1
man,	1
Stand	1
at	1
my	1
side	1
till	1
I	1
lean	1
as	1
high	1
as	1
I	1
can	1
upon	1
you,	1
Fill	1
me	1
with	1
albescent	1
honey,	1
bend	1
down	1
to	1
me,	1
Rub	1
to	1
me	1
with	1
your	1
chafing	1
beard,	1
rub	1
to	1
my	1
breast	1
and	1
shoulders.	1

The	1
old	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
many	1
children,	1
Whist!	1
I	1
am	1
fully	1
content.	1
Lull'd	1
and	1
late	1
is	1
the	1
smoke	1
of	1
the	1
First-day	1
morning,	1
It	1
hangs	1
low	1
over	1
the	1
rows	1
of	1
trees	1
by	1
the	1
fences,	1
It	1
hangs	1
thin	1
by	1
the	1
sassafras	1
and	1
wild-cherry	1
and	1
cat-brier	1
under	1
them.	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
rich	1
ladies	1
in	1
full	1
dress	1
at	1
the	1
soiree,	1
I	1
heard	1
what	1
the	1
singers	1
were	1
singing	1
so	1
long,	1
Heard	1
who	1
sprang	1
in	1
crimson	1
youth	1
from	1
the	1
white	1
froth	1
and	1
the	1
water-blue.	1
Behold	1
a	1
woman!	1
She	1
looks	1
out	1
from	1
her	1
quaker	1
cap,	1
her	1
face	1
is	1
clearer	1
and	1
more	1
beautiful	1
than	1
the	1
sky.	1
She	1
sits	1
in	1
an	1
armchair	1
under	1
the	1
shaded	1
porch	1
of	1
the	1
farmhouse,	1
The	1
sun	1
just	1
shines	1
on	1
her	1
old	1
white	1
head.	1
Her	1
ample	1
gown	1
is	1
of	1
cream-hued	1
linen,	1
Her	1
grandsons	1
raised	1
the	1
flax,	1
and	1
her	1
grand-daughters	1
spun	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
distaff	1
and	1
the	1
wheel.	1
The	1
melodious	1
character	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
The	1
finish	1
beyond	1
which	1
philosophy	1
cannot	1
go	1
and	1
does	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
go,	1
The	1
justified	1
mother	1
of	1
men.	1

some	1
strange	1
musician,	1
Hovering	1
unseen	1

vibrates	1
capricious	1
tunes	1
to-night.	1
I	1
hear	1
thee	1
trumpeter,	1
listening	1
alert	1

catch	1
thy	1
notes,	1
Now	1
pouring,	1
whirling	1
like	1
a	1
tempest	1
round	1
me,	1
Now	1
low,	1
subdued,	1
now	1
in	1

Come	1
nearer	1
bodiless	1

haply	1
in	1
thee	1
resounds	1
Some	1
dead	1
composer,	1
haply	1
thy	1
pensive	1
life	1
Was	1
fill'd	1
with	1
aspirations	1
high,	1
unform'd	1
ideals,	1
Waves,	1
oceans	1
musical,	1
chaotically	1
surging,	1
That	1
now	1
ecstatic	1
ghost,	1
close	1

bending,	1
thy	1
cornet	1
echoing,	1
pealing,	1
Gives	1
out	1
to	1
no	1
one's	1
ears	1
but	1
mine,	1
but	1
freely	1
gives	1
to	1
mine,	1
That	1
I	1
may	1
thee	1
translate.	1

Blow	1
trumpeter	1
free	1
and	1
clear,	1
I	1

thee,	1
While	1
at	1
thy	1
liquid	1
prelude,	1
glad,	1
serene,	1
The	1
fretting	1
world,	1
the	1
streets,	1

noisy	1
hours	1
of	1
day	1
withdraw,	1
A	1

descends	1

I	1
walk	1
in	1
cool	1

the	1
walks	1

Paradise,	1
I	1
scent	1
the	1
grass,	1
the	1
moist	1
air	1
and	1
the	1
roses;	1
Thy	1
song	1
expands	1
my	1
numb'd	1
imbonded	1

freest,	1
launchest	1

Floating	1
and	1
basking	1
upon	1
heaven's	1
lake.	1

Blow	1
again	1
trumpeter!	1
and	1
for	1
my	1
sensuous	1
eyes,	1
Bring	1
the	1
old	1
pageants,	1
show	1
the	1
feudal	1
world.	1
What	1
charm	1
thy	1
music	1
works!	1
thou	1
makest	1
pass	1

Ladies	1

Lo,	1

Blow	1

and	1
for	1

Take	1
now	1
the	1
enclosing	1
theme	1
of	1
all,	1
the	1
solvent	1
and	1
the	1
setting,	1
Love,	1
that	1
is	1
pulse	1

all,	1
the	1
sustenance	1

The	1
heart	1
of	1
man	1

all	1
for	1
love,	1
No	1
other	1
theme	1

love--knitting,	1
enclosing,	1
all-diffusing	1
love.	1
O	1
how	1
the	1
immortal	1
phantoms	1
crowd	1
around	1
me!	1
I	1
see	1
the	1
vast	1

blissful	1
happy	1
some,	1
and	1
some	1
so	1
silent,	1
dark,	1
and	1
nigh	1
to	1
death;	1
Love,	1
that	1
is	1
all	1
the	1

to	1
lovers--love,	1
that	1
mocks	1
time	1

Love,	1
that	1
is	1
day	1

night--love,	1
that	1
is	1
sun	1

Love,	1
that	1
is	1
crimson,	1
sumptuous,	1
sick	1

No	1

words	1

no	1
other	1

love.	1

alarums.	1
Swift	1
to	1
thy	1
spell	1
a	1
shuddering	1
hum	1
like	1
distant	1
thunder	1
rolls,	1
Lo,	1
where	1
the	1
arm'd	1

hasten--lo,	1
mid	1
the	1
clouds	1
of	1
dust	1
the	1
glint	1
of	1
bayonets,	1
I	1
see	1
the	1
grime-faced	1
cannoneers,	1
I	1
mark	1
the	1
rosy	1
flash	1
amid	1
the	1
smoke,	1
I	1
hear	1
the	1
cracking	1
of	1
the	1
guns;	1
Nor	1
war	1
alone--thy	1
fearful	1
music-song,	1
wild	1
player,	1
brings	1
every	1
sight	1
of	1
fear,	1
The	1
deeds	1
of	1
ruthless	1
brigands,	1
rapine,	1
murder--I	1
hear	1
the	1
cries	1
for	1
help!	1
I	1
see	1
ships	1
foundering	1

I	1
behold	1

Thou	1

my	1

changest	1
them	1
at	1

And	1
now	1
thy	1
sullen	1
notes	1
send	1
darkness	1
through	1
me,	1
Thou	1
takest	1
away	1
all	1
cheering	1
light,	1
all	1
hope,	1
I	1
see	1
the	1
enslaved,	1
the	1
overthrown,	1
the	1
hurt,	1
the	1
opprest	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
earth,	1
I	1
feel	1
the	1
measureless	1
shame	1
and	1
humiliation	1
of	1
my	1
race,	1
it	1
becomes	1
all	1
mine,	1
Mine	1
too	1
the	1
revenges	1
of	1
humanity,	1
the	1
wrongs	1
of	1
ages,	1
baffled	1
feuds	1
and	1
hatreds,	1
Utter	1
defeat	1
upon	1
me	1

lost--the	1
foe	1
victorious,	1

'mid	1

Rouse	1
up	1
my	1

some	1
vision	1
of	1
the	1

Give	1
me	1
for	1

a	1

a	1

liquid,	1
sane,	1
unruly,	1
musical,	1
self-sufficient,	1

that	1
the	1

All	1
Is	1
Truth	1
O	1
me,	1
man	1
of	1
slack	1
faith	1
so	1
long,	1
Standing	1
aloof,	1
denying	1
portions	1
so	1
long,	1
Only	1
aware	1
to-day	1
of	1
compact	1
all-diffused	1
truth,	1
Discovering	1
to-day	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
lie	1
or	1
form	1
of	1
lie,	1
and	1
can	1
be	1
none,	1
but	1
grows	1
as	1
inevitably	1
upon	1
itself	1
as	1
the	1
truth	1
does	1
upon	1
itself,	1
Or	1
as	1
any	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
or	1
any	1
natural	1
production	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
does.	1
(This	1
is	1
curious	1
and	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
realized	1
immediately,	1
but	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
realized,	1
I	1
feel	1
in	1
myself	1
that	1
I	1
represent	1
falsehoods	1
equally	1
with	1
the	1
rest,	1
And	1
that	1
the	1
universe	1
does.)	1
Where	1
has	1
fail'd	1
a	1
perfect	1
return	1
indifferent	1
of	1
lies	1
or	1
the	1
truth?	1
Is	1
it	1
upon	1
the	1
ground,	1
or	1
in	1
water	1
or	1
fire?	1
or	1
in	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
man?	1
or	1
in	1
the	1
meat	1
and	1
blood?	1
Meditating	1
among	1
liars	1
and	1
retreating	1
sternly	1
into	1
myself,	1
I	1
see	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
really	1
no	1
liars	1
or	1
lies	1
after	1
all,	1
And	1
that	1
nothing	1
fails	1
its	1
perfect	1
return,	1
and	1
that	1
what	1
are	1
called	1
lies	1
are	1
perfect	1
returns,	1
And	1
that	1
each	1
thing	1
exactly	1
represents	1
itself	1
and	1
what	1
has	1
preceded	1
it,	1
And	1
that	1
the	1
truth	1
includes	1
all,	1
and	1
is	1
compact	1
just	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
space	1
is	1
compact,	1
And	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
flaw	1
or	1
vacuum	1
in	1
the	1
amount	1
of	1
the	1

That	1

Unheard	1
by	1

Nor	1

the	1

Open	1

still	1
a	1

an	1

Costless,	1
vouchsafed	1

Thoughts	1
1	1
Of	1
these	1
years	1
I	1
sing,	1
How	1
they	1
pass	1
and	1
have	1
pass'd	1
through	1
convuls'd	1
pains,	1
as	1
through	1
parturitions,	1
How	1
America	1
illustrates	1
birth,	1
muscular	1
youth,	1
the	1
promise,	1
the	1
sure	1
fulfilment,	1
the	1
absolute	1
success,	1
despite	1
of	1
people--illustrates	1
evil	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
good,	1
The	1
vehement	1
struggle	1
so	1
fierce	1
for	1
unity	1
in	1
one's-self,	1
How	1
many	1
hold	1
despairingly	1
yet	1
to	1
the	1
models	1
departed,	1
caste,	1
myths,	1
obedience,	1
compulsion,	1
and	1
to	1
infidelity,	1
How	1
few	1
see	1
the	1
arrived	1
models,	1
the	1
athletes,	1
the	1
Western	1
States,	1
or	1
see	1
freedom	1
or	1
spirituality,	1
or	1
hold	1
any	1
faith	1
in	1
results,	1
(But	1
I	1
see	1
the	1
athletes,	1
and	1
I	1
see	1
the	1
results	1
of	1
the	1
war	1
glorious	1
and	1
inevitable,	1
and	1
they	1
again	1
leading	1
to	1
other	1
results.)	1
How	1
the	1
great	1
cities	1
appear--how	1
the	1
Democratic	1
masses,	1
turbulent,	1
willful,	1
as	1
I	1
love	1
them,	1
How	1
the	1
whirl,	1
the	1
contest,	1
the	1
wrestle	1
of	1
evil	1
with	1
good,	1
the	1
sounding	1
and	1
resounding,	1
keep	1
on	1
and	1
on,	1
How	1
society	1
waits	1
unform'd,	1
and	1
is	1
for	1
a	1
while	1
between	1
things	1
ended	1
and	1
things	1
begun,	1
How	1
America	1
is	1
the	1
continent	1
of	1
glories,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
triumph	1
of	1
freedom	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Democracies,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
fruits	1
of	1
society,	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
begun,	1
And	1
how	1
the	1
States	1
are	1
complete	1
in	1
themselves--and	1
how	1
all	1
triumphs	1
and	1
glories	1
are	1
complete	1
in	1
themselves,	1
to	1
lead	1
onward,	1
And	1
how	1
these	1
of	1
mine	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
States	1
will	1
in	1
their	1
turn	1
be	1
convuls'd,	1
and	1
serve	1
other	1
parturitions	1
and	1
transitions,	1
And	1
how	1
all	1
people,	1
sights,	1
combinations,	1
the	1
democratic	1
masses	1
too,	1
serve--and	1
how	1
every	1
fact,	1
and	1
war	1
itself,	1
with	1
all	1
its	1
horrors,	1
serves,	1
And	1
how	1
now	1
or	1
at	1
any	1
time	1
each	1
serves	1
the	1
exquisite	1
transition	1
of	1
death.	1

Of	1
seeds	1

Of	1

I	1
pass,	1

vocal,	1
visible,	1
contrary,	1

a	1
melodious	1
echo,	1
passionately	1
bent	1
for,	1
(death	1

of	1

then	1
when	1
no	1

for	1
toward	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
incessantly	1
preparing.	1
What	1
is	1
there	1
more,	1
that	1
I	1
lag	1
and	1
pause	1
and	1
crouch	1
extended	1
with	1
unshut	1
mouth?	1
Is	1
there	1
a	1
single	1
final	1
farewell?	1
My	1
songs	1
cease,	1
I	1
abandon	1
them,	1
From	1

hid	1

forth.	1

breath	1
falls	1
