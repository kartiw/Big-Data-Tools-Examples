BUSTER	1
BEAR	1
GOES	1
FISHING	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
yawned	1
as	1
he	1
lay	1
on	1
his	1
comfortable	1
bed	1
of	1
leaves	1
and	1
watched	1
the	1
first	1
early	1
morning	1
sunbeams	1
creeping	1
through	1
the	1
Green	1
Forest	1
to	1
chase	1
out	1
the	1
Black	1
Shadows.	1
Once	1
more	1
he	1
yawned,	1
and	1
slowly	1
got	1
to	1
his	1
feet	1
and	1
shook	1
himself.	1
Then	1
he	1
walked	1
over	1
to	1
a	1
big	1
pine-tree,	1
stood	1
up	1
on	1
his	1
hind	1
legs,	1
reached	1
as	1
high	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
trunk	1
of	1
the	1
tree	1
as	1
he	1
could,	1
and	1
scratched	1
the	1
bark	1
with	1
his	1
great	1
claws.	1
After	1
that	1
he	1
yawned	1
until	1
it	1
seemed	1
as	1
if	1
his	1
jaws	1
would	1
crack,	1
and	1
then	1
sat	1
down	1
to	1
think	1
what	1
he	1
wanted	1
for	1
breakfast.	1
While	1
he	1
sat	1
there,	1
trying	1
to	1
make	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
what	1
would	1
taste	1
best,	1
he	1
was	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
sounds	1
that	1
told	1
of	1
the	1
waking	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
little	1
people	1
who	1
live	1
in	1
the	1
Green	1
Forest.	1
He	1
heard	1
Sammy	1
Jay	1
way	1
off	1
in	1
the	1
distance	1
screaming,	1
"Thief!	1
Thief!"	1
and	1
grinned.	1
"I	1
wonder,"	1
thought	1
Buster,	1
"if	1
some	1
one	1
has	1
stolen	1
Sammy's	1
breakfast,	1
or	1
if	1
he	1
has	1
stolen	1
the	1
breakfast	1
of	1
some	1
one	1
else.	1
Probably	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
thief	1
himself."	1
He	1
heard	1
Chatterer	1
the	1
Red	1
Squirrel	1
scolding	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
make	1
his	1
tongue	1
go	1
and	1
working	1
himself	1
into	1
a	1
terrible	1
rage.	1
"Must	1
be	1
that	1
Chatterer	1
got	1
out	1
of	1
bed	1
the	1
wrong	1
way	1
this	1
morning,"	1
thought	1
he.	1
He	1
heard	1
Blacky	1
the	1
Crow	1
cawing	1
at	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
his	1
lungs,	1
and	1
he	1
knew	1
by	1
the	1
sound	1
that	1
Blacky	1
was	1
getting	1
into	1
mischief	1
of	1
some	1
kind.	1
He	1
heard	1
the	1
sweet	1
voices	1
of	1
happy	1
little	1
singers,	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
good	1
to	1
hear.	1
But	1
most	1
of	1
all	1
he	1
listened	1
to	1
a	1
merry,	1
low,	1
silvery	1
laugh	1
that	1
never	1
stopped	1
but	1
went	1
on	1
and	1
on,	1
until	1
he	1
just	1
felt	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
must	1
laugh	1
too.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
Laughing	1
Brook.	1
And	1
as	1
Buster	1
listened	1
it	1
suddenly	1
came	1
to	1
him	1
just	1
what	1
he	1
wanted	1
for	1
breakfast.	1
"I'm	1
going	1
fishing,"	1
said	1
he	1
in	1
his	1
deep	1
grumbly-rumbly	1
voice	1
to	1
no	1
one	1
in	1
particular.	1
"Yes,	1
Sir,	1
I'm	1
going	1
fishing.	1
I	1
want	1
some	1
fat	1
trout	1
for	1
my	1
breakfast."	1
He	1
shuffled	1
along	1
over	1
to	1
the	1
Laughing	1
Brook,	1
and	1
straight	1
to	1
a	1
little	1
pool	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
knew,	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
drew	1
near	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
greatest	1
care	1
not	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
teeniest,	1
weeniest	1
bit	1
of	1
noise.	1
Now	1
it	1
just	1
happened	1
that	1
early	1
as	1
he	1
was,	1
some	1
one	1
was	1
before	1
Buster	1
Bear.	1
When	1
he	1
came	1
in	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
pool,	1
who	1
should	1
he	1
see	1
but	1
another	1
fisherman	1
there,	1
who	1
had	1
already	1
caught	1
a	1
fine	1
fat	1
trout.	1
Who	1
was	1
it?	1
Why,	1
Little	1
Joe	1
Otter	1
to	1
be	1
sure.	1
He	1
was	1
just	1
climbing	1
up	1
the	1
bank	1
with	1
the	1
fat	1
trout	1
in	1
his	1
mouth.	1
Buster	1
Bear's	1
own	1
mouth	1
watered	1
as	1
he	1
saw	1
it.	1
Little	1
Joe	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
bank	1
and	1
prepared	1
to	1
enjoy	1
his	1
breakfast.	1
He	1
hadn't	1
seen	1
Buster	1
Bear,	1
and	1
he	1
didn't	1
know	1
that	1
he	1
or	1
any	1
one	1
else	1
was	1
anywhere	1
near.	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
tiptoed	1
up	1
very	1
softly	1
until	1
he	1
was	1
right	1
behind	1
Little	1
Joe	1
Otter.	1
"Woof,	1
woof!"	1
said	1
he	1
in	1
his	1
deepest,	1
most	1
grumbly-rumbly	1
voice.	1
"That's	1
a	1
very	1
fine	1
looking	1
trout.	1
I	1
wouldn't	1
mind	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
it	1
myself."	1
Little	1
Joe	1
Otter	1
gave	1
a	1
frightened	1
squeal	1
and	1
without	1
even	1
turning	1
to	1
see	1
who	1
was	1
speaking	1
dropped	1
his	1
fish	1
and	1
dived	1
headfirst	1
into	1
the	1
Laughing	1
Brook.	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
sprang	1
forward	1
and	1
with	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
big	1
paws	1
caught	1
the	1
fat	1
trout	1
just	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
slipping	1
back	1
into	1
the	1
water.	1
"Here's	1
your	1
trout,	1
Mr.	1
Otter,"	1
said	1
he,	1
as	1
Little	1
Joe	1
put	1
his	1
head	1
out	1
of	1
water	1
to	1
see	1
who	1
had	1
frightened	1
him	1
so.	1
"Come	1
and	1
get	1
it."	1
[Illustration:	1
"Here's	1
your	1
trout,	1
Mr.	1
Otter,"	1
said	1
he.	1
_Page	1
5._]	1
But	1
Little	1
Joe	1
wouldn't.	1
The	1
fact	1
is,	1
he	1
was	1
afraid	1
to.	1
He	1
snarled	1
at	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
and	1
called	1
him	1
a	1
thief	1
and	1
everything	1
bad	1
he	1
could	1
think	1
of.	1
Buster	1
didn't	1
seem	1
to	1
mind.	1
He	1
chuckled	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
thought	1
it	1
all	1
a	1
great	1
joke	1
and	1
repeated	1
his	1
invitation	1
to	1
Little	1
Joe	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
get	1
his	1
fish.	1
But	1
Little	1
Joe	1
just	1
turned	1
his	1
back	1
and	1
went	1
off	1
down	1
the	1
Laughing	1
Brook	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
rage.	1
"It's	1
too	1
bad	1
to	1
waste	1
such	1
a	1
fine	1
fish,"	1
said	1
Buster	1
thoughtfully.	1
"I	1
wonder	1
what	1
I'd	1
better	1
do	1
with	1
it."	1
And	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
wondering,	1
he	1
ate	1
it	1
all	1
up.	1
Then	1
he	1
started	1
down	1
the	1
Laughing	1
Brook	1
to	1
try	1
to	1
catch	1
some	1
for	1
himself.	1
II	1
LITTLE	1
JOE	1
OTTER	1
GETS	1
EVEN	1
WITH	1
BUSTER	1
BEAR	1
Little	1
Joe	1
Otter	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
terrible	1
rage.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
bad	1
beginning	1
for	1
a	1
beautiful	1
day	1
and	1
Little	1
Joe	1
knew	1
it.	1
But	1
who	1
wouldn't	1
be	1
in	1
a	1
rage	1
if	1
his	1
breakfast	1
was	1
taken	1
from	1
him	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
eat	1
it?	1
Anyway,	1
that	1
is	1
what	1
Little	1
Joe	1
told	1
Billy	1
Mink.	1
Perhaps	1
he	1
didn't	1
tell	1
it	1
quite	1
exactly	1
as	1
it	1
was,	1
but	1
you	1
know	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
badly	1
frightened	1
at	1
the	1
time.	1
"I	1
was	1
sitting	1
on	1
the	1
bank	1
of	1
the	1
Laughing	1
Brook	1
beside	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
pools,"	1
he	1
told	1
Billy	1
Mink,	1
"and	1
was	1
just	1
going	1
to	1
eat	1
a	1
fat	1
trout	1
I	1
had	1
caught,	1
when	1
who	1
should	1
come	1
along	1
but	1
that	1
great	1
big	1
bully,	1
Buster	1
Bear.	1
He	1
took	1
that	1
fat	1
trout	1
away	1
from	1
me	1
and	1
ate	1
it	1
just	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
belonged	1
to	1
him!	1
I	1
hate	1
him!	1
If	1
I	1
live	1
long	1
enough	1
I'm	1
going	1
to	1
get	1
even	1
with	1
him!"	1
Of	1
course	1
that	1
wasn't	1
nice	1
talk	1
and	1
anything	1
but	1
a	1
nice	1
spirit,	1
but	1
Little	1
Joe	1
Otter's	1
temper	1
is	1
sometimes	1
pretty	1
short,	1
especially	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
hungry,	1
and	1
this	1
time	1
he	1
had	1
had	1
no	1
breakfast,	1
you	1
know.	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
hadn't	1
actually	1
taken	1
the	1
fish	1
away	1
from	1
Little	1
Joe.	1
But	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
matter	1
as	1
Little	1
Joe	1
did,	1
it	1
amounted	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
thing.	1
You	1
see,	1
Buster	1
knew	1
perfectly	1
well	1
when	1
he	1
invited	1
Little	1
Joe	1
to	1
come	1
back	1
and	1
get	1
it	1
that	1
Little	1
Joe	1
wouldn't	1
dare	1
do	1
anything	1
of	1
the	1
kind.	1
"Where	1
is	1
he	1
now?"	1
asked	1
Billy	1
Mink.	1
"He's	1
somewhere	1
up	1
the	1
Laughing	1
Brook.	1
I	1
wish	1
he'd	1
fall	1
in	1
and	1
get	1
drowned!"	1
snapped	1
Little	1
Joe.	1
Billy	1
Mink	1
just	1
had	1
to	1
laugh.	1
The	1
idea	1
of	1
great	1
big	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
getting	1
drowned	1
in	1
the	1
Laughing	1
Brook	1
was	1
too	1
funny.	1
There	1
wasn't	1
water	1
enough	1
in	1
it	1
anywhere	1
except	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
Smiling	1
Pool,	1
and	1
that	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
Green	1
Meadows,	1
where	1
Buster	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
known	1
to	1
go.	1
"Let's	1
go	1
see	1
what	1
he	1
is	1
doing,"	1
said	1
Billy	1
Mink.	1
At	1
first	1
Little	1
Joe	1
didn't	1
want	1
to,	1
but	1
at	1
last	1
his	1
curiosity	1
got	1
the	1
better	1
of	1
his	1
fear,	1
and	1
he	1
agreed.	1
So	1
the	1
two	1
little	1
brown-coated	1
scamps	1
turned	1
down	1
the	1
Laughing	1
Brook,	1
taking	1
the	1
greatest	1
care	1
to	1
keep	1
out	1
of	1
sight	1
themselves.	1
They	1
had	1
gone	1
only	1
a	1
little	1
way	1
when	1
Billy	1
Mink	1
whispered:	1
"Sh-h!	1
There	1
he	1
is."	1
Sure	1
enough,	1
there	1
was	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
sitting	1
close	1
beside	1
a	1
little	1
pool	1
and	1
looking	1
into	1
it	1
very	1
intently.	1
"What's	1
he	1
doing?"	1
asked	1
Little	1
Joe	1
Otter,	1
as	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
sat	1
for	1
the	1
longest	1
time	1
without	1
moving.	1
Just	1
then	1
one	1
of	1
Buster's	1
big	1
paws	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
water	1
as	1
quick	1
as	1
a	1
flash	1
and	1
scooped	1
out	1
a	1
trout	1
that	1
had	1
ventured	1
too	1
near.	1
"He's	1
fishing!"	1
exclaimed	1
Billy	1
Mink.	1
And	1
that	1
is	1
just	1
what	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
was	1
doing,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
very	1
plain	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
having	1
great	1
fun.	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
eaten	1
the	1
trout	1
he	1
had	1
caught,	1
he	1
moved	1
along	1
to	1
the	1
next	1
little	1
pool.	1
"They	1
are	1
_our_	1
fish!"	1
said	1
Little	1
Joe	1
fiercely.	1
"He	1
has	1
no	1
business	1
catching	1
_our_	1
fish!"	1
"I	1
don't	1
see	1
how	1
we	1
are	1
going	1
to	1
stop	1
him,"	1
said	1
Billy	1
Mink.	1
"I	1
do!"	1
cried	1
Little	1
Joe,	1
into	1
whose	1
head	1
an	1
idea	1
had	1
just	1
popped.	1
"I'm	1
going	1
to	1
drive	1
all	1
the	1
fish	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
pools	1
and	1
muddy	1
the	1
water	1
all	1
up.	1
Then	1
we'll	1
see	1
how	1
many	1
fish	1
he	1
will	1
get!	1
Just	1
you	1
watch	1
me	1
get	1
even	1
with	1
Buster	1
Bear."	1
Little	1
Joe	1
slipped	1
swiftly	1
into	1
the	1
water	1
and	1
swam	1
straight	1
to	1
the	1
little	1
pool	1
that	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
would	1
try	1
next.	1
He	1
frightened	1
the	1
fish	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
fled	1
in	1
every	1
direction.	1
Then	1
he	1
stirred	1
up	1
the	1
mud	1
until	1
the	1
water	1
was	1
so	1
dirty	1
that	1
Buster	1
couldn't	1
have	1
seen	1
a	1
fish	1
right	1
under	1
his	1
nose.	1
He	1
did	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
in	1
the	1
next	1
pool	1
and	1
the	1
next.	1
Buster	1
Bear's	1
fishing	1
was	1
spoiled	1
for	1
that	1
day.	1
III	1
BUSTER	1
BEAR	1
IS	1
GREATLY	1
PUZZLED	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
hadn't	1
enjoyed	1
himself	1
so	1
much	1
since	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
Green	1
Forest	1
to	1
live.	1
His	1
fun	1
began	1
when	1
he	1
surprised	1
Little	1
Joe	1
Otter	1
on	1
the	1
bank	1
of	1
a	1
little	1
pool	1
in	1
the	1
Laughing	1
Brook	1
and	1
Little	1
Joe	1
was	1
so	1
frightened	1
that	1
he	1
dropped	1
a	1
fat	1
trout	1
he	1
had	1
just	1
caught.	1
It	1
had	1
seemed	1
like	1
a	1
great	1
joke	1
to	1
Buster	1
Bear,	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
chuckled	1
over	1
it	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
he	1
was	1
eating	1
the	1
fat	1
trout.	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
finished	1
it,	1
he	1
started	1
on	1
to	1
do	1
some	1
fishing	1
himself.	1
Presently	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
another	1
little	1
pool.	1
He	1
stole	1
up	1
to	1
it	1
very,	1
very	1
softly,	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
frighten	1
the	1
fish.	1
Then	1
he	1
sat	1
down	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
it	1
and	1
didn't	1
move.	1
Buster	1
learned	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
ago	1
that	1
a	1
fisherman	1
must	1
be	1
patient	1
unless,	1
like	1
Little	1
Joe	1
Otter,	1
he	1
is	1
just	1
as	1
much	1
at	1
home	1
in	1
the	1
water	1
as	1
the	1
fish	1
themselves,	1
and	1
can	1
swim	1
fast	1
enough	1
to	1
catch	1
them	1
by	1
chasing	1
them.	1
So	1
he	1
didn't	1
move	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
an	1
eye	1
lash.	1
He	1
was	1
so	1
still	1
that	1
he	1
looked	1
almost	1
like	1
the	1
stump	1
of	1
an	1
old	1
tree.	1
Perhaps	1
that	1
is	1
what	1
the	1
fish	1
thought	1
he	1
was,	1
for	1
pretty	1
soon,	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
swam	1
right	1
in	1
close	1
to	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
sitting.	1
Now	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
may	1
be	1
big	1
and	1
clumsy	1
looking,	1
but	1
there	1
isn't	1
anything	1
that	1
can	1
move	1
much	1
quicker	1
than	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
big	1
paws	1
of	1
his	1
when	1
he	1
wants	1
it	1
to.	1
One	1
of	1
them	1
moved	1
now,	1
and	1
quicker	1
than	1
a	1
wink	1
had	1
scooped	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
foolish	1
fish	1
out	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
bank.	1
Buster's	1
little	1
eyes	1
twinkled,	1
and	1
he	1
smacked	1
his	1
lips	1
as	1
he	1
moved	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
next	1
little	1
pool,	1
for	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
of	1
no	1
use	1
to	1
stay	1
longer	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
one.	1
The	1
fish	1
were	1
so	1
frightened	1
that	1
they	1
wouldn't	1
come	1
back	1
for	1
a	1
long,	1
long	1
time.	1
At	1
the	1
next	1
little	1
pool	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
happened.	1
By	1
this	1
time	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
was	1
in	1
fine	1
spirits.	1
It	1
was	1
fun	1
to	1
catch	1
the	1
fish,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
still	1
more	1
fun	1
to	1
eat	1
them.	1
What	1
finer	1
breakfast	1
could	1
any	1
one	1
have	1
than	1
fresh-caught	1
trout?	1
No	1
wonder	1
he	1
felt	1
good!	1
But	1
it	1
takes	1
more	1
than	1
three	1
trout	1
to	1
fill	1
Buster	1
Bear's	1
stomach,	1
so	1
he	1
kept	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
next	1
little	1
pool.	1
But	1
this	1
little	1
pool,	1
instead	1
of	1
being	1
beautiful	1
and	1
clear	1
so	1
that	1
Buster	1
could	1
see	1
right	1
to	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
it	1
and	1
so	1
tell	1
if	1
there	1
were	1
any	1
fish	1
there,	1
was	1
so	1
muddy	1
that	1
he	1
couldn't	1
see	1
into	1
it	1
at	1
all.	1
It	1
looked	1
as	1
if	1
some	1
one	1
had	1
just	1
stirred	1
up	1
all	1
the	1
mud	1
at	1
the	1
bottom.	1
"Huh!"	1
said	1
Buster	1
Bear.	1
"It's	1
of	1
no	1
use	1
to	1
try	1
to	1
fish	1
here.	1
I	1
would	1
just	1
waste	1
my	1
time.	1
I'll	1
try	1
the	1
next	1
pool."	1
So	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
next	1
little	1
pool.	1
He	1
found	1
this	1
just	1
as	1
muddy	1
as	1
the	1
other.	1
Then	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
to	1
another,	1
and	1
this	1
was	1
no	1
better.	1
Buster	1
sat	1
down	1
and	1
scratched	1
his	1
head.	1
It	1
was	1
puzzling.	1
Yes,	1
Sir,	1
it	1
was	1
puzzling.	1
He	1
looked	1
this	1
way	1
and	1
he	1
looked	1
that	1
way	1
suspiciously,	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
be	1
seen.	1
Everything	1
was	1
still	1
save	1
for	1
the	1
laughter	1
of	1
the	1
Laughing	1
Brook.	1
Somehow,	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
Buster	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
Brook	1
were	1
laughing	1
at	1
him.	1
"It's	1
very	1
curious,"	1
muttered	1
Buster,	1
"very	1
curious	1
indeed.	1
It	1
looks	1
as	1
if	1
my	1
fishing	1
is	1
spoiled	1
for	1
to-day.	1
I	1
don't	1
understand	1
it	1
at	1
all.	1
It's	1
lucky	1
I	1
caught	1
what	1
I	1
did.	1
It	1
looks	1
as	1
if	1
somebody	1
is	1
trying	1
to--ha!"	1
A	1
sudden	1
thought	1
had	1
popped	1
into	1
his	1
head.	1
Then	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
chuckle	1
and	1
finally	1
to	1
laugh.	1
"I	1
do	1
believe	1
that	1
scamp	1
Joe	1
Otter	1
is	1
trying	1
to	1
get	1
even	1
with	1
me	1
for	1
eating	1
that	1
fat	1
trout!"	1
And	1
then,	1
because	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
always	1
enjoys	1
a	1
good	1
joke	1
even	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
on	1
himself,	1
he	1
laughed	1
until	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
hold	1
his	1
sides,	1
which	1
is	1
a	1
whole	1
lot	1
better	1
than	1
going	1
off	1
in	1
a	1
rage	1
as	1
Little	1
Joe	1
Otter	1
had	1
done.	1
"You're	1
pretty	1
smart,	1
Mr.	1
Otter!	1
You're	1
pretty	1
smart,	1
but	1
there	1
are	1
other	1
people	1
who	1
are	1
smart	1
too,"	1
said	1
Buster	1
Bear,	1
and	1
still	1
chuckling,	1
he	1
went	1
off	1
to	1
think	1
up	1
a	1
plan	1
to	1
get	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
Little	1
Joe	1
Otter.	1
IV	1
LITTLE	1
JOE	1
OTTER	1
SUPPLIES	1
BUSTER	1
BEAR	1
WITH	1
A	1
BREAKFAST	1
Getting	1
even	1
just	1
for	1
spite	1
Doesn't	1
always	1
pay.	1
Fact	1
is,	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
apt	1
To	1
work	1
the	1
other	1
way.	1
That	1
is	1
just	1
how	1
it	1
came	1
about	1
that	1
Little	1
Joe	1
Otter	1
furnished	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
with	1
the	1
best	1
breakfast	1
he	1
had	1
had	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time.	1
He	1
didn't	1
mean	1
to	1
do	1
it.	1
Oh,	1
my,	1
no!	1
The	1
truth	1
is,	1
he	1
thought	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
preventing	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
from	1
getting	1
a	1
breakfast.	1
You	1
see	1
he	1
wasn't	1
well	1
enough	1
acquainted	1
with	1
Buster	1
to	1
know	1
that	1
Buster	1
is	1
quite	1
as	1
smart	1
as	1
he	1
is,	1
and	1
perhaps	1
a	1
little	1
bit	1
smarter.	1
Spite	1
and	1
selfishness	1
were	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
it.	1
You	1
see	1
Little	1
Joe	1
and	1
Billy	1
Mink	1
had	1
had	1
all	1
the	1
fishing	1
in	1
the	1
Laughing	1
Brook	1
to	1
themselves	1
so	1
long	1
that	1
they	1
thought	1
no	1
one	1
else	1
had	1
any	1
right	1
to	1
fish	1
there.	1
To	1
be	1
sure	1
Bobby	1
Coon	1
caught	1
a	1
few	1
little	1
fish	1
there,	1
but	1
they	1
didn't	1
mind	1
Bobby.	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy	1
fished	1
there	1
too,	1
sometimes,	1
and	1
this	1
always	1
made	1
Little	1
Joe	1
and	1
Billy	1
Mink	1
very	1
angry,	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
so	1
afraid	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
they	1
didn't	1
dare	1
do	1
anything	1
about	1
it.	1
But	1
when	1
they	1
discovered	1
that	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
was	1
a	1
fisherman,	1
they	1
made	1
up	1
their	1
minds	1
that	1
something	1
had	1
got	1
to	1
be	1
done.	1
At	1
least,	1
Little	1
Joe	1
did.	1
"He'll	1
try	1
it	1
again	1
to-morrow	1
morning,"	1
said	1
Little	1
Joe.	1
"I'll	1
keep	1
watch,	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
I	1
see	1
him	1
coming,	1
I'll	1
drive	1
out	1
all	1
the	1
fish,	1
just	1
as	1
I	1
did	1
to-day.	1
I	1
guess	1
that'll	1
teach	1
him	1
to	1
let	1
our	1
fish	1
alone."	1
So	1
the	1
next	1
morning	1
Little	1
Joe	1
hid	1
before	1
daylight	1
close	1
by	1
the	1
little	1
pool	1
where	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
had	1
given	1
him	1
such	1
a	1
fright.	1
Sure	1
enough,	1
just	1
as	1
the	1
Jolly	1
Sunbeams	1
began	1
to	1
creep	1
through	1
the	1
Green	1
Forest,	1
he	1
saw	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
coming	1
straight	1
over	1
to	1
the	1
little	1
pool.	1
Little	1
Joe	1
slipped	1
into	1
the	1
water	1
and	1
chased	1
all	1
the	1
fish	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
pool,	1
and	1
stirred	1
up	1
the	1
mud	1
on	1
the	1
bottom	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
water	1
was	1
so	1
muddy	1
that	1
the	1
bottom	1
couldn't	1
be	1
seen	1
at	1
all.	1
Then	1
he	1
hurried	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
next	1
little	1
pool	1
and	1
did	1
the	1
same	1
thing.	1
Now	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
is	1
very	1
smart.	1
You	1
know	1
he	1
had	1
guessed	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
who	1
had	1
spoiled	1
his	1
fishing.	1
So	1
this	1
morning	1
he	1
only	1
went	1
far	1
enough	1
to	1
make	1
sure	1
that	1
if	1
Little	1
Joe	1
were	1
watching	1
for	1
him,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
sure	1
he	1
would	1
be,	1
he	1
would	1
see	1
him	1
coming.	1
Then,	1
instead	1
of	1
keeping	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
little	1
pool,	1
he	1
hurried	1
to	1
a	1
place	1
way	1
down	1
the	1
Laughing	1
Brook,	1
where	1
the	1
water	1
was	1
very	1
shallow,	1
hardly	1
over	1
his	1
feet,	1
and	1
there	1
he	1
sat	1
chuckling	1
to	1
himself.	1
Things	1
happened	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
expected.	1
The	1
frightened	1
fish	1
Little	1
Joe	1
chased	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
pools	1
up	1
above	1
swam	1
down	1
the	1
Laughing	1
Brook,	1
because,	1
you	1
know,	1
Little	1
Joe	1
was	1
behind	1
them,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
nowhere	1
else	1
for	1
them	1
to	1
go.	1
When	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
Buster	1
was	1
waiting,	1
all	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
do	1
was	1
to	1
scoop	1
them	1
out	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
bank.	1
It	1
was	1
great	1
fun.	1
It	1
didn't	1
take	1
Buster	1
long	1
to	1
catch	1
all	1
the	1
fish	1
he	1
could	1
eat.	1
Then	1
he	1
saved	1
a	1
nice	1
fat	1
trout	1
and	1
waited.	1
By	1
and	1
by	1
along	1
came	1
Little	1
Joe	1
Otter,	1
chuckling	1
to	1
think	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
spoiled	1
Buster	1
Bear's	1
fishing.	1
He	1
was	1
so	1
intent	1
on	1
looking	1
behind	1
him	1
to	1
see	1
if	1
Buster	1
was	1
coming	1
that	1
he	1
didn't	1
see	1
Buster	1
waiting	1
there	1
until	1
he	1
spoke.	1
"I'm	1
much	1
obliged	1
for	1
the	1
fine	1
breakfast	1
you	1
have	1
given	1
me,"	1
said	1
Buster	1
in	1
his	1
deepest,	1
most	1
grumbly-rumbly	1
voice.	1
"I've	1
saved	1
a	1
fat	1
trout	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
make	1
up	1
for	1
the	1
one	1
I	1
ate	1
yesterday.	1
I	1
hope	1
we'll	1
go	1
fishing	1
together	1
often."	1
Then	1
he	1
went	1
off	1
laughing	1
fit	1
to	1
kill	1
himself.	1
Little	1
Joe	1
couldn't	1
find	1
a	1
word	1
to	1
say.	1
He	1
was	1
so	1
surprised	1
and	1
angry	1
that	1
he	1
went	1
off	1
by	1
himself	1
and	1
sulked.	1
And	1
Billy	1
Mink,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
watching,	1
ate	1
the	1
fat	1
trout.	1
V	1
GRANDFATHER	1
FROG'S	1
COMMON-SENSE	1
There	1
is	1
nothing	1
quite	1
like	1
common	1
sense	1
to	1
smooth	1
out	1
troubles.	1
People	1
who	1
have	1
plenty	1
of	1
just	1
plain	1
common	1
sense	1
are	1
often	1
thought	1
to	1
be	1
very	1
wise.	1
Their	1
neighbors	1
look	1
up	1
to	1
them	1
and	1
are	1
forever	1
running	1
to	1
them	1
for	1
advice,	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
very	1
much	1
respected.	1
That	1
is	1
the	1
way	1
with	1
Grandfather	1
Frog.	1
He	1
is	1
very	1
old	1
and	1
very	1
wise.	1
Anyway,	1
that	1
is	1
what	1
his	1
neighbors	1
think.	1
The	1
truth	1
is,	1
he	1
simply	1
has	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
common	1
sense,	1
which	1
after	1
all	1
is	1
the	1
very	1
best	1
kind	1
of	1
wisdom.	1
Now	1
when	1
Little	1
Joe	1
Otter	1
found	1
that	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
had	1
been	1
too	1
smart	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
that	1
instead	1
of	1
spoiling	1
Buster's	1
fishing	1
in	1
the	1
Laughing	1
Brook	1
he	1
had	1
really	1
made	1
it	1
easier	1
for	1
Buster	1
to	1
catch	1
all	1
the	1
fish	1
he	1
wanted,	1
Little	1
Joe	1
went	1
off	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
Smiling	1
Pool	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
rage.	1
Billy	1
Mink	1
stopped	1
long	1
enough	1
to	1
eat	1
the	1
fat	1
fish	1
Buster	1
had	1
left	1
on	1
the	1
bank	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
too	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
Smiling	1
Pool.	1
When	1
Little	1
Joe	1
Otter	1
and	1
Billy	1
Mink	1
reached	1
the	1
Smiling	1
Pool,	1
they	1
climbed	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
Big	1
Rock,	1
and	1
there	1
Little	1
Joe	1
sulked	1
and	1
sulked,	1
until	1
finally	1
Grandfather	1
Frog	1
asked	1
what	1
the	1
matter	1
was.	1
Little	1
Joe	1
wouldn't	1
tell,	1
but	1
Billy	1
Mink	1
told	1
the	1
whole	1
story.	1
When	1
he	1
told	1
how	1
Buster	1
had	1
been	1
too	1
smart	1
for	1
Little	1
Joe,	1
it	1
tickled	1
him	1
so	1
that	1
Billy	1
had	1
to	1
laugh	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
himself.	1
So	1
did	1
Grandfather	1
Frog.	1
So	1
did	1
Jerry	1
Muskrat,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
listening.	1
Of	1
course	1
this	1
made	1
Little	1
Joe	1
angrier	1
than	1
ever.	1
He	1
said	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
unkind	1
things	1
about	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
and	1
about	1
Billy	1
Mink	1
and	1
Grandfather	1
Frog	1
and	1
Jerry	1
Muskrat,	1
because	1
they	1
had	1
laughed	1
at	1
the	1
smartness	1
of	1
Buster.	1
"He's	1
nothing	1
but	1
a	1
great	1
big	1
bully	1
and	1
thief!"	1
declared	1
Little	1
Joe.	1
"Chug-a-rum!	1
He	1
may	1
be	1
a	1
bully,	1
because	1
great	1
big	1
people	1
are	1
very	1
apt	1
to	1
be	1
bullies,	1
and	1
though	1
I	1
haven't	1
seen	1
him,	1
I	1
guess	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
is	1
big	1
enough	1
from	1
all	1
I	1
have	1
heard,	1
but	1
I	1
don't	1
see	1
how	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
thief,"	1
said	1
Grandfather	1
Frog.	1
"Didn't	1
he	1
catch	1
my	1
fish	1
and	1
eat	1
them?"	1
snapped	1
Little	1
Joe.	1
"Doesn't	1
that	1
make	1
him	1
a	1
thief?"	1
"They	1
were	1
no	1
more	1
your	1
fish	1
than	1
mine,"	1
protested	1
Billy	1
Mink.	1
"Well,	1
_our_	1
fish,	1
then!	1
He	1
stole	1
_our_	1
fish,	1
if	1
you	1
like	1
that	1
any	1
better.	1
That	1
makes	1
him	1
just	1
as	1
much	1
a	1
thief,	1
doesn't	1
it?"	1
growled	1
Little	1
Joe.	1
Grandfather	1
Frog	1
looked	1
up	1
at	1
jolly,	1
round,	1
bright	1
Mr.	1
Sun	1
and	1
slowly	1
winked	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
great,	1
goggly	1
eyes.	1
"There	1
comes	1
a	1
foolish	1
green	1
fly,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"Who	1
does	1
he	1
belong	1
to?"	1
"Nobody!"	1
snapped	1
Little	1
Joe.	1
"What	1
have	1
foolish	1
green	1
flies	1
got	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
my--I	1
mean	1
_our_	1
fish?"	1
"Nothing,	1
nothing	1
at	1
all,"	1
replied	1
Grandfather	1
Frog	1
mildly.	1
"I	1
was	1
just	1
hoping	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
come	1
near	1
enough	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
snap	1
him	1
up;	1
then	1
he	1
would	1
belong	1
to	1
me.	1
As	1
long	1
as	1
he	1
doesn't,	1
he	1
doesn't	1
belong	1
to	1
any	1
one.	1
I	1
suppose	1
that	1
if	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
should	1
happen	1
along	1
and	1
catch	1
him,	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
stealing	1
from	1
me,	1
according	1
to	1
Little	1
Joe."	1
"Of	1
course	1
not!	1
What	1
a	1
silly	1
idea!	1
You're	1
getting	1
foolish	1
in	1
your	1
old	1
age,"	1
retorted	1
Little	1
Joe.	1
"Can	1
you	1
tell	1
me	1
the	1
difference	1
between	1
the	1
fish	1
that	1
you	1
haven't	1
caught	1
and	1
the	1
foolish	1
green	1
flies	1
that	1
I	1
haven't	1
caught?"	1
asked	1
Grandfather	1
Frog.	1
Little	1
Joe	1
couldn't	1
find	1
a	1
word	1
to	1
say.	1
"You	1
take	1
my	1
advice,	1
Little	1
Joe	1
Otter,"	1
continued	1
Grandfather	1
Frog,	1
"and	1
always	1
make	1
friends	1
with	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
bigger	1
and	1
stronger	1
and	1
smarter	1
than	1
you	1
are.	1
You'll	1
find	1
it	1
pays."	1

VI	1
LITTLE	1
JOE	1
OTTER	1
TAKES	1
GRANDFATHER	1
FROG'S	1
ADVICE	1
Who	1
makes	1
an	1
enemy	1
a	1
friend,	1
To	1
fear	1
and	1
worry	1
puts	1
an	1
end.	1
Little	1
Joe	1
Otter	1
found	1
that	1
out	1
when	1
he	1
took	1
Grandfather	1
Frog's	1
advice.	1
He	1
wouldn't	1
have	1
admitted	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
Buster	1
Bear.	1
No	1
one	1
ever	1
likes	1
to	1
admit	1
being	1
afraid,	1
least	1
of	1
all	1
Little	1
Joe	1
Otter.	1
And	1
really	1
Little	1
Joe	1
has	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
courage.	1
Very	1
few	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
Green	1
Forest	1
or	1
the	1
Green	1
Meadows	1
would	1
willingly	1
quarrel	1
with	1
him,	1
for	1
Little	1
Joe	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
fighter	1
when	1
he	1
has	1
to	1
fight.	1
As	1
for	1
all	1
those	1
who	1
live	1
in	1
or	1
along	1
the	1
Laughing	1
Brook	1
or	1
in	1
the	1
Smiling	1
Pool,	1
they	1
let	1
Little	1
Joe	1
have	1
his	1
own	1
way	1
in	1
everything.	1
Now	1
having	1
one's	1
own	1
way	1
too	1
much	1
is	1
a	1
bad	1
thing.	1
It	1
is	1
apt	1
to	1
make	1
one	1
selfish	1
and	1
thoughtless	1
of	1
other	1
people	1
and	1
very	1
hard	1
to	1
get	1
along	1
with.	1
Little	1
Joe	1
Otter	1
had	1
his	1
way	1
too	1
much.	1
Grandfather	1
Frog	1
knew	1
it	1
and	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
very	1
soberly	1
when	1
Little	1
Joe	1
had	1
been	1
disrespectful	1
to	1
him.	1
"Too	1
bad.	1
Too	1
bad!	1
Too	1
bad!	1
Chug-a-rum!	1
It	1
is	1
too	1
bad	1
that	1
such	1
a	1
fine	1
young	1
fellow	1
as	1
Little	1
Joe	1
should	1
spoil	1
a	1
good	1
disposition	1
by	1
such	1
selfish	1
heedlessness.	1
Too	1
bad,"	1
said	1
he.	1
So,	1
though	1
he	1
didn't	1
let	1
on	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
so,	1
Grandfather	1
Frog	1
really	1
was	1
delighted	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
how	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
had	1
been	1
too	1
smart	1
for	1
Little	1
Joe	1
Otter.	1
It	1
tickled	1
him	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
hard	1
work	1
to	1
keep	1
a	1
straight	1
face.	1
But	1
he	1
did	1
and	1
was	1
as	1
grave	1
and	1
solemn	1
as	1
you	1
please	1
as	1
he	1
advised	1
Little	1
Joe	1
always	1
to	1
make	1
friends	1
with	1
any	1
one	1
who	1
was	1
bigger	1
and	1
stronger	1
and	1
smarter	1
than	1
he.	1
That	1
was	1
good	1
common	1
sense	1
advice,	1
but	1
Little	1
Joe	1
just	1
sniffed	1
and	1
went	1
off	1
declaring	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
get	1
even	1
with	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
yet.	1
Now	1
Little	1
Joe	1
is	1
good-natured	1
and	1
full	1
of	1
fun	1
as	1
a	1
rule,	1
and	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
reached	1
home	1
and	1
his	1
temper	1
had	1
cooled	1
off	1
a	1
little,	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
joke	1
on	1
himself,--how	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
worked	1
so	1
hard	1
to	1
frighten	1
the	1
fish	1
in	1
the	1
little	1
pools	1
of	1
the	1
Laughing	1
Brook	1
so	1
that	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
should	1
not	1
catch	1
any,	1
he	1
had	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
been	1
driving	1
them	1
right	1
into	1
Buster's	1
paws.	1
By	1
and	1
by	1
he	1
grinned.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
sheepish	1
grin	1
at	1
first,	1
but	1
at	1
last	1
it	1
grew	1
into	1
a	1
laugh.	1
"I	1
believe,"	1
said	1
Little	1
Joe	1
as	1
he	1
wiped	1
tears	1
of	1
laughter	1
from	1
his	1
eyes,	1
"that	1
Grandfather	1
Frog	1
is	1
right,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
best	1
thing	1
I	1
can	1
do	1
is	1
to	1
make	1
friends	1
with	1
Buster	1
Bear.	1
I'll	1
try	1
it	1
to-morrow	1
morning."	1
So	1
very	1
early	1
the	1
next	1
morning	1
Little	1
Joe	1
Otter	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
best	1
fishing	1
pool	1
he	1
knew	1
of	1
in	1
the	1
Laughing	1
Brook,	1
and	1
there	1
he	1
caught	1
the	1
biggest	1
trout	1
he	1
could	1
find.	1
It	1
was	1
so	1
big	1
and	1
fat	1
that	1
it	1
made	1
Little	1
Joe's	1
mouth	1
water,	1
for	1
you	1
know	1
fat	1
trout	1
are	1
his	1
favorite	1
food.	1
But	1
he	1
didn't	1
take	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
one	1
bite.	1
Instead	1
he	1
carefully	1
laid	1
it	1
on	1
an	1
old	1
log	1
where	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
would	1
be	1
sure	1
to	1
see	1
it	1
if	1
he	1
should	1
come	1
along	1
that	1
way.	1
Then	1
he	1
hid	1
near	1
by,	1
where	1
he	1
could	1
watch.	1
Buster	1
was	1
late	1
that	1
morning.	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
Little	1
Joe	1
that	1
he	1
never	1
would	1
come.	1
Once	1
he	1
nearly	1
lost	1
the	1
fish.	1
He	1
had	1
turned	1
his	1
head	1
for	1
just	1
a	1
minute,	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
looked	1
back	1
again,	1
the	1
trout	1
was	1
nowhere	1
to	1
be	1
seen.	1
Buster	1
couldn't	1
have	1
stolen	1
up	1
and	1
taken	1
it,	1
because	1
such	1
a	1
big	1
fellow	1
couldn't	1
possibly	1
have	1
gotten	1
out	1
of	1
sight	1
again.	1
Little	1
Joe	1
darted	1
over	1
to	1
the	1
log	1
and	1
looked	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side.	1
There	1
was	1
the	1
fat	1
trout,	1
and	1
there	1
also	1
was	1
Little	1
Joe's	1
smallest	1
cousin,	1
Shadow	1
the	1
Weasel,	1
who	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
thief	1
and	1
altogether	1
bad.	1
Little	1
Joe	1
sprang	1
at	1
him	1
angrily,	1
but	1
Shadow	1
was	1
too	1
quick	1
and	1
darted	1
away.	1
Little	1
Joe	1
put	1
the	1
fish	1
back	1
on	1
the	1
log	1
and	1
waited.	1
This	1
time	1
he	1
didn't	1
take	1
his	1
eyes	1
off	1
it.	1
At	1
last,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
almost	1
ready	1
to	1
give	1
up,	1
he	1
saw	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
shuffling	1
along	1
towards	1
the	1
Laughing	1
Brook.	1
Suddenly	1
Buster	1
stopped	1
and	1
sniffed.	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
Merry	1
Little	1
Breezes	1
had	1
carried	1
the	1
scent	1
of	1
that	1
fat	1
trout	1
over	1
to	1
him.	1
Then	1
he	1
came	1
straight	1
over	1
to	1
where	1
the	1
fish	1
lay,	1
his	1
nose	1
wrinkling,	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
twinkling	1
with	1
pleasure.	1
"Now	1
I	1
wonder	1
who	1
was	1
so	1
thoughtful	1
as	1
to	1
leave	1
this	1
fine	1
breakfast	1
ready	1
for	1
me,"	1
said	1
he	1
out	1
loud.	1
"Me,"	1
said	1
Little	1
Joe	1
in	1
a	1
rather	1
faint	1
voice.	1
"I	1
caught	1
it	1
especially	1
for	1
you."	1
"Thank	1
you,"	1
replied	1
Buster,	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
twinkled	1
more	1
than	1
ever.	1
"I	1
think	1
we	1
are	1
going	1
to	1
be	1
friends."	1
"I--I	1
hope	1
so,"	1
replied	1
Little	1
Joe.	1
VII	1
FARMER	1
BROWN'S	1
BOY	1
HAS	1
NO	1
LUCK	1
AT	1
ALL	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy	1
tramped	1
through	1
the	1
Green	1
Forest,	1
whistling	1
merrily.	1
He	1
always	1
whistles	1
when	1
he	1
feels	1
light-hearted,	1
and	1
he	1
always	1
feels	1
light-hearted	1
when	1
he	1
goes	1
fishing.	1
You	1
see,	1
he	1
is	1
just	1
as	1
fond	1
of	1
fishing	1
as	1
is	1
Little	1
Joe	1
Otter	1
or	1
Billy	1
Mink	1
or	1
Buster	1
Bear.	1
And	1
now	1
he	1
was	1
making	1
his	1
way	1
through	1
the	1
Green	1
Forest	1
to	1
the	1
Laughing	1
Brook,	1
sure	1
that	1
by	1
the	1
time	1
he	1
had	1
followed	1
it	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
Smiling	1
Pool	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
a	1
fine	1
lot	1
of	1
trout	1
to	1
take	1
home.	1
He	1
knew	1
every	1
pool	1
in	1
the	1
Laughing	1
Brook	1
where	1
the	1
trout	1
love	1
to	1
hide,	1
did	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
just	1
the	1
kind	1
of	1
a	1
morning	1
when	1
the	1
trout	1
should	1
be	1
hungry.	1
So	1
he	1
whistled	1
as	1
he	1
tramped	1
along,	1
and	1
his	1
whistle	1
was	1
good	1
to	1
hear.	1
When	1
he	1
reached	1
the	1
first	1
little	1
pool	1
he	1
baited	1
his	1
hook	1
very	1
carefully	1
and	1
then,	1
taking	1
the	1
greatest	1
care	1
to	1
keep	1
out	1
of	1
sight	1
of	1
any	1
trout	1
that	1
might	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
little	1
pool,	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
fish.	1
Now	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy	1
learned	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
ago	1
that	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
successful	1
fisherman	1
one	1
must	1
have	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
patience,	1
so	1
though	1
he	1
didn't	1
get	1
a	1
bite	1
right	1
away	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
expected	1
to,	1
he	1
wasn't	1
the	1
least	1
bit	1
discouraged.	1
He	1
kept	1
very	1
quiet	1
and	1
fished	1
and	1
fished,	1
patiently	1
waiting	1
for	1
a	1
foolish	1
trout	1
to	1
take	1
his	1
hook.	1
But	1
he	1
didn't	1
get	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
a	1
nibble.	1
"Either	1
the	1
trout	1
have	1
lost	1
their	1
appetite	1
or	1
they	1
have	1
grown	1
very	1
wise,"	1
muttered	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy,	1
as	1
after	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
he	1
moved	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
next	1
little	1
pool.	1
There	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
happened.	1
He	1
was	1
very	1
patient,	1
very,	1
very	1
patient,	1
but	1
his	1
patience	1
brought	1
no	1
reward,	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
the	1
faintest	1
kind	1
of	1
a	1
nibble.	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy	1
trudged	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
next	1
pool,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
puzzled	1
frown	1
on	1
his	1
freckled	1
face.	1
Such	1
a	1
thing	1
never	1
had	1
happened	1
before.	1
He	1
didn't	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
make	1
of	1
it.	1
All	1
the	1
night	1
before	1
he	1
had	1
dreamed	1
about	1
the	1
delicious	1
dinner	1
of	1
fried	1
trout	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
the	1
next	1
day,	1
and	1
now--well,	1
if	1
he	1
didn't	1
catch	1
some	1
trout	1
pretty	1
soon,	1
that	1
splendid	1
dinner	1
would	1
never	1
be	1
anything	1
but	1
a	1
dream.	1
"If	1
I	1
didn't	1
know	1
that	1
nobody	1
else	1
comes	1
fishing	1
here,	1
I	1
should	1
think	1
that	1
somebody	1
had	1
been	1
here	1
this	1
very	1
morning	1
and	1
caught	1
all	1
the	1
fish	1
or	1
else	1
frightened	1
them	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
all	1
in	1
hiding,"	1
said	1
he,	1
as	1
he	1
trudged	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
next	1
little	1
pool.	1
"I	1
never	1
had	1
such	1
bad	1
luck	1
in	1
all	1
my	1
life	1
before.	1
Hello!	1
What's	1
this?"	1
There,	1
on	1
the	1
bank	1
beside	1
the	1
little	1
pool,	1
were	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
three	1
trout.	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy	1
scowled	1
down	1
at	1
them	1
more	1
puzzled	1
than	1
ever.	1
"Somebody	1
_has_	1
been	1
fishing	1
here,	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
had	1
better	1
luck	1
than	1
I	1
have,"	1
thought	1
he.	1
He	1
looked	1
up	1
the	1
Laughing	1
Brook	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
Laughing	1
Brook	1
and	1
this	1
way	1
and	1
that	1
way,	1
but	1
no	1
one	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
seen.	1
Then	1
he	1
picked	1
up	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
heads	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
it	1
sharply.	1
"It	1
wasn't	1
cut	1
off	1
with	1
a	1
knife;	1
it	1
was	1
bitten	1
off!"	1
he	1
exclaimed.	1
"I	1
wonder	1
now	1
if	1
Billy	1
Mink	1
is	1
the	1
scamp	1
who	1
has	1
spoiled	1
my	1
fun."	1
Thereafter	1
he	1
kept	1
a	1
sharp	1
lookout	1
for	1
signs	1
of	1
Billy	1
Mink,	1
but	1
though	1
he	1
found	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
more	1
trout	1
heads,	1
he	1
saw	1
no	1
other	1
signs	1
and	1
he	1
caught	1
no	1
fish.	1
This	1
puzzled	1
him	1
more	1
than	1
ever.	1
It	1
didn't	1
seem	1
possible	1
that	1
such	1
a	1
little	1
fellow	1
as	1
Billy	1
Mink	1
could	1
have	1
caught	1
or	1
frightened	1
all	1
the	1
fish	1
or	1
have	1
eaten	1
so	1
many.	1
Besides,	1
he	1
didn't	1
remember	1
ever	1
having	1
known	1
Billy	1
to	1
leave	1
heads	1
around	1
that	1
way.	1
Billy	1
sometimes	1
catches	1
more	1
fish	1
than	1
he	1
can	1
eat,	1
but	1
then	1
he	1
usually	1
hides	1
them.	1
The	1
farther	1
he	1
went	1
down	1
the	1
Laughing	1
Brook,	1
the	1
more	1
puzzled	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy	1
grew.	1
It	1
made	1
him	1
feel	1
very	1
queer.	1
He	1
would	1
have	1
felt	1
still	1
more	1
queer	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
known	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
two	1
other	1
fishermen	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
before	1
him	1
were	1
watching	1
him	1
and	1
chuckling	1
to	1
themselves.	1
They	1
were	1
Little	1
Joe	1
Otter	1
and	1
Buster	1
Bear.	1
VIII	1
FARMER	1
BROWN'S	1
BOY	1
FEELS	1
HIS	1
HAIR	1
RISE	1
'Twas	1
just	1
a	1
sudden	1
odd	1
surprise	1
Made	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy's	1
hair	1
to	1
rise.	1
That's	1
a	1
funny	1
thing	1
for	1
hair	1
to	1
do--rise	1
up	1
all	1
of	1
a	1
sudden--isn't	1
it?	1
But	1
that	1
is	1
just	1
what	1
the	1
hair	1
on	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy's	1
head	1
did	1
the	1
day	1
he	1
went	1
fishing	1
in	1
the	1
Laughing	1
Brook	1
and	1
had	1
no	1
luck	1
at	1
all.	1
There	1
are	1
just	1
two	1
things	1
that	1
make	1
hair	1
rise--anger	1
and	1
fear.	1
Anger	1
sometimes	1
makes	1
the	1
hair	1
on	1
the	1
back	1
and	1
neck	1
of	1
Bowser	1
the	1
Hound	1
and	1
of	1
some	1
other	1
little	1
people	1
bristle	1
and	1
stand	1
up,	1
and	1
you	1
know	1
the	1
hair	1
on	1
the	1
tail	1
of	1
Black	1
Pussy	1
stands	1
on	1
end	1
until	1
her	1
tail	1
looks	1
twice	1
as	1
big	1
as	1
it	1
really	1
is.	1
Both	1
anger	1
and	1
fear	1
make	1
it	1
do	1
that.	1
But	1
there	1
is	1
only	1
one	1
thing	1
that	1
can	1
make	1
the	1
hair	1
on	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy	1
rise,	1
and	1
as	1
it	1
isn't	1
anger,	1
of	1
course	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
fear.	1
It	1
never	1
had	1
happened	1
before.	1
You	1
see,	1
there	1
isn't	1
much	1
of	1
anything	1
that	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy	1
is	1
really	1
afraid	1
of.	1
Perhaps	1
he	1
wouldn't	1
have	1
been	1
afraid	1
this	1
time	1
if	1
it	1
hadn't	1
been	1
for	1
the	1
surprise	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
found.	1
You	1
see	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
found	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
those	1
trout	1
on	1
the	1
bank	1
he	1
knew	1
right	1
away	1
that	1
some	1
one	1
else	1
had	1
been	1
fishing,	1
and	1
that	1
was	1
why	1
he	1
couldn't	1
catch	1
any;	1
but	1
it	1
didn't	1
seem	1
possible	1
that	1
little	1
Billy	1
Mink	1
could	1
have	1
eaten	1
all	1
those	1
trout,	1
and	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy	1
didn't	1
once	1
think	1
of	1
Little	1
Joe	1
Otter,	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
was	1
very,	1
very	1
much	1
puzzled.	1
He	1
was	1
turning	1
it	1
all	1
over	1
in	1
his	1
mind	1
and	1
studying	1
what	1
it	1
could	1
mean,	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
little	1
muddy	1
place	1
on	1
the	1
bank	1
of	1
the	1
Laughing	1
Brook,	1
and	1
there	1
he	1
saw	1
something	1
that	1
made	1
his	1
eyes	1
look	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
would	1
pop	1
right	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
right	1
then	1
that	1
he	1
felt	1
his	1
hair	1
rise.	1
Anyway,	1
that	1
is	1
what	1
he	1
said	1
when	1
he	1
told	1
about	1
it	1
afterward.	1
What	1
was	1
it	1
he	1
saw?	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
think?	1
Why,	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
footprint	1
in	1
the	1
soft	1
mud.	1
Yes,	1
Sir,	1
that's	1
what	1
it	1
was,	1
and	1
all	1
it	1
was.	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
biggest	1
footprint	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy	1
ever	1
had	1
seen,	1
and	1
it	1
looked	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
made	1
only	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
before.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
footprint	1
of	1
Buster	1
Bear.	1
Now	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy	1
didn't	1
know	1
that	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
had	1
come	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
Green	1
Forest	1
to	1
live.	1
He	1
never	1
had	1
heard	1
of	1
a	1
Bear	1
being	1
in	1
the	1
Green	1
Forest.	1
And	1
so	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
surprised	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
hard	1
work	1
to	1
believe	1
his	1
own	1
eyes,	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
queer	1
feeling	1
all	1
over,--a	1
little	1
chilly	1
feeling,	1
although	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
warm	1
day.	1
Somehow,	1
he	1
didn't	1
feel	1
like	1
meeting	1
Buster	1
Bear.	1
If	1
he	1
had	1
had	1
his	1
terrible	1
gun	1
with	1
him,	1
it	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
different.	1
But	1
he	1
didn't,	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
suddenly	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
that	1
he	1
didn't	1
want	1
to	1
fish	1
any	1
more	1
that	1
day.	1
He	1
had	1
a	1
funny	1
feeling,	1
too,	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
being	1
watched,	1
although	1
he	1
couldn't	1
see	1
any	1
one.	1
He	1
_was_	1
being	1
watched.	1
Little	1
Joe	1
Otter	1
and	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
were	1
watching	1
him	1
and	1
taking	1
the	1
greatest	1
care	1
to	1
keep	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
sight.	1
All	1
the	1
way	1
home	1
through	1
the	1
Green	1
Forest,	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy	1
kept	1
looking	1
behind	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
didn't	1
draw	1
a	1
long	1
breath	1
until	1
he	1
reached	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
Green	1
Forest.	1
He	1
hadn't	1
run,	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
wanted	1
to.	1
"Huh!"	1
said	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
to	1
Little	1
Joe	1
Otter,	1
"I	1
believe	1
he	1
was	1
afraid!"	1
And	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
was	1
just	1
exactly	1
right.	1
IX	1
LITTLE	1
JOE	1
OTTER	1
HAS	1
GREAT	1
NEWS	1
TO	1
TELL	1
Little	1
Joe	1
Otter	1
was	1
fairly	1
bursting	1
with	1
excitement.	1
He	1
could	1
hardly	1
contain	1
himself.	1
He	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
greatest	1
news	1
to	1
tell	1
since	1
Peter	1
Rabbit	1
had	1
first	1
found	1
the	1
tracks	1
of	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
in	1
the	1
Green	1
Forest.	1
He	1
couldn't	1
keep	1
it	1
to	1
himself	1
a	1
minute	1
longer	1
than	1
he	1
had	1
to.	1
So	1
he	1
hurried	1
to	1
the	1
Smiling	1
Pool,	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
sure	1
he	1
would	1
find	1
Billy	1
Mink	1
and	1
Jerry	1
Muskrat	1
and	1
Grandfather	1
Frog	1
and	1
Spotty	1
the	1
Turtle,	1
and	1
he	1
hoped	1
that	1
perhaps	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
people	1
who	1
live	1
in	1
the	1
Green	1
Forest	1
might	1
be	1
there	1
too.	1
Sure	1
enough,	1
Peter	1
Rabbit	1
was	1
there	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
Smiling	1
Pool,	1
making	1
faces	1
at	1
Reddy	1
Fox,	1
who	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side,	1
which,	1
of	1
course,	1
was	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
nice	1
of	1
Peter.	1
Mr.	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Redwing	1
were	1
there,	1
and	1
Blacky	1
the	1
Crow	1
was	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
Big	1
Hickory-tree.	1
Little	1
Joe	1
Otter	1
swam	1
straight	1
to	1
the	1
Big	1
Rock	1
and	1
climbed	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
very	1
highest	1
part.	1
He	1
looked	1
so	1
excited,	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
sparkled	1
so,	1
that	1
every	1
one	1
knew	1
right	1
away	1
that	1
something	1
had	1
happened.	1
"Hi!"	1
cried	1
Billy	1
Mink.	1
"Look	1
at	1
Little	1
Joe	1
Otter!	1
It	1
must	1
be	1
that	1
for	1
once	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
smarter	1
than	1
Buster	1
Bear."	1
Little	1
Joe	1
made	1
a	1
good-natured	1
face	1
at	1
Billy	1
Mink	1
and	1
shook	1
his	1
head.	1
"No,	1
Billy,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"you	1
are	1
wrong,	1
altogether	1
wrong.	1
I	1
don't	1
believe	1
anybody	1
can	1
be	1
smarter	1
than	1
Buster	1
Bear."	1
[Illustration:	1
Reddy	1
glared	1
across	1
the	1
Smiling	1
Pool	1
at	1
Peter.	1
_Page	1
45._]	1
Reddy	1
Fox	1
rolled	1
his	1
lips	1
back	1
in	1
an	1
unpleasant	1
grin.	1
"Don't	1
be	1
too	1
sure	1
of	1
that!"	1
he	1
snapped.	1
"I'm	1
not	1
through	1
with	1
him	1
yet."	1
"Boaster!	1
Boaster!"	1
cried	1
Peter	1
Rabbit.	1
Reddy	1
glared	1
across	1
the	1
Smiling	1
Pool	1
at	1
Peter.	1
"I'm	1
not	1
through	1
with	1
you	1
either,	1
Peter	1
Rabbit!"	1
he	1
snarled.	1
"You'll	1
find	1
it	1
out	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
fine	1
days!"	1
"Reddy,	1
Reddy,	1
smart	1
and	1
sly,	1
Couldn't	1
catch	1
a	1
buzzing	1
fly!"	1
taunted	1
Peter.	1
"Chug-a-rum!"	1
said	1
Grandfather	1
Frog	1
in	1
his	1
deepest,	1
gruffest	1
voice.	1
"We	1
know	1
all	1
about	1
that.	1
What	1
we	1
want	1
to	1
know	1
is	1
what	1
Little	1
Joe	1
Otter	1
has	1
got	1
on	1
his	1
mind."	1
"It's	1
news--great	1
news!"	1
cried	1
Little	1
Joe.	1
"We	1
can	1
tell	1
better	1
how	1
great	1
it	1
is	1
when	1
we	1
hear	1
what	1
it	1
is,"	1
replied	1
Grandfather	1
Frog	1
testily.	1
"What	1
is	1
it?"	1
Little	1
Joe	1
Otter	1
looked	1
around	1
at	1
all	1
the	1
eager	1
faces	1
watching	1
him,	1
and	1
then	1
in	1
the	1
slowest,	1
most	1
provoking	1
way,	1
he	1
drawled:	1
"Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy	1
is	1
afraid	1
of	1
Buster	1
Bear."	1
For	1
a	1
minute	1
no	1
one	1
said	1
a	1
word.	1
Then	1
Blacky	1
the	1
Crow	1
leaned	1
down	1
from	1
his	1
perch	1
in	1
the	1
Big	1
Hickory-tree	1
and	1
looked	1
very	1
hard	1
at	1
Little	1
Joe	1
as	1
he	1
said:	1
"I	1
don't	1
believe	1
it.	1
I	1
don't	1
believe	1
a	1
word	1
of	1
it.	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy	1
isn't	1
afraid	1
of	1
any	1
one	1
who	1
lives	1
in	1
the	1
Green	1
Forest	1
or	1
on	1
the	1
Green	1
Meadows	1
or	1
in	1
the	1
Smiling	1
Pool,	1
and	1
you	1
know	1
it.	1
We	1
are	1
all	1
afraid	1
of	1
him."	1
Little	1
Joe	1
glared	1
back	1
at	1
Blacky.	1
"I	1
don't	1
care	1
whether	1
you	1
believe	1
it	1
or	1
not;	1
it's	1
true,"	1
he	1
retorted.	1
Then	1
he	1
told	1
how	1
early	1
that	1
very	1
morning	1
he	1
and	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
had	1
been	1
fishing	1
together	1
in	1
the	1
Laughing	1
Brook,	1
and	1
how	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy	1
had	1
been	1
fishing	1
there	1
too,	1
and	1
hadn't	1
caught	1
a	1
single	1
trout	1
because	1
they	1
had	1
all	1
been	1
caught	1
or	1
frightened	1
before	1
he	1
got	1
there.	1
Then	1
he	1
told	1
how	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy	1
had	1
found	1
a	1
footprint	1
of	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
in	1
the	1
soft	1
mud,	1
and	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
stopped	1
fishing	1
right	1
away	1
and	1
started	1
for	1
home,	1
looking	1
behind	1
him	1
with	1
fear	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
all	1
the	1
way.	1
"Now	1
tell	1
me	1
that	1
he	1
isn't	1
afraid!"	1
concluded	1
Little	1
Joe.	1
"For	1
once	1
he	1
knows	1
just	1
how	1
we	1
feel	1
when	1
he	1
comes	1
prowling	1
around	1
where	1
we	1
are.	1
Isn't	1
that	1
great	1
news?	1
Now	1
we'll	1
get	1
even	1
with	1
_him_!"	1
"I'll	1
believe	1
it	1
when	1
I	1
see	1
it	1
for	1
myself!"	1
snapped	1
Blacky	1
the	1
Crow.	1
X	1
BUSTER	1
BEAR	1
BECOMES	1
A	1
HERO	1
The	1
news	1
that	1
Little	1
Joe	1
Otter	1
told	1
at	1
the	1
Smiling	1
Pool,--how	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy	1
had	1
run	1
away	1
from	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
without	1
even	1
seeing	1
him,--soon	1
spread	1
all	1
over	1
the	1
Green	1
Meadows	1
and	1
through	1
the	1
Green	1
Forest,	1
until	1
every	1
one	1
who	1
lives	1
there	1
knew	1
about	1
it.	1
Of	1
course,	1
Peter	1
Rabbit	1
helped	1
spread	1
it.	1
Trust	1
Peter	1
for	1
that!	1
But	1
everybody	1
else	1
helped	1
too.	1
You	1
see,	1
they	1
had	1
all	1
been	1
afraid	1
of	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy	1
for	1
so	1
long	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
tickled	1
almost	1
to	1
pieces	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
thought	1
of	1
having	1
some	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
Green	1
Forest	1
who	1
could	1
make	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy	1
feel	1
fear	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
felt	1
it.	1
And	1
so	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
became	1
a	1
hero	1
right	1
away	1
to	1
most	1
of	1
them.	1
A	1
few	1
doubted	1
Little	1
Joe's	1
story.	1
One	1
of	1
them	1
was	1
Blacky	1
the	1
Crow.	1
Another	1
was	1
Reddy	1
Fox.	1
Blacky	1
doubted	1
because	1
he	1
knew	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy	1
so	1
well	1
that	1
he	1
couldn't	1
imagine	1
him	1
afraid.	1
Reddy	1
doubted	1
because	1
he	1
didn't	1
want	1
to	1
believe.	1
You	1
see,	1
he	1
was	1
jealous	1
of	1
Buster	1
Bear,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
he	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
him.	1
So	1
Reddy	1
pretended	1
not	1
to	1
believe	1
a	1
word	1
of	1
what	1
Little	1
Joe	1
Otter	1
had	1
said,	1
and	1
he	1
agreed	1
with	1
Blacky	1
that	1
only	1
by	1
seeing	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy	1
afraid	1
could	1
he	1
ever	1
be	1
made	1
to	1
believe	1
it.	1
But	1
nearly	1
everybody	1
else	1
believed	1
it,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
great	1
rejoicing.	1
Most	1
of	1
them	1
were	1
afraid	1
of	1
Buster,	1
very	1
much	1
afraid	1
of	1
him,	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
big	1
and	1
strong.	1
But	1
they	1
were	1
still	1
more	1
afraid	1
of	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy,	1
because	1
they	1
didn't	1
know	1
him	1
or	1
understand	1
him,	1
and	1
because	1
in	1
the	1
past	1
he	1
had	1
tried	1
to	1
catch	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
in	1
traps	1
and	1
had	1
hunted	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
with	1
his	1
terrible	1
gun.	1
So	1
now	1
they	1
were	1
very	1
proud	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
number	1
actually	1
had	1
frightened	1
him,	1
and	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
look	1
on	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
as	1
a	1
real	1
hero.	1
They	1
tried	1
in	1
ever	1
so	1
many	1
ways	1
to	1
show	1
him	1
how	1
friendly	1
they	1
felt	1
and	1
went	1
quite	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
way	1
to	1
do	1
him	1
favors.	1
Whenever	1
they	1
met	1
one	1
another,	1
all	1
they	1
could	1
talk	1
about	1
was	1
the	1
smartness	1
and	1
the	1
greatness	1
of	1
Buster	1
Bear.	1
"Now	1
I	1
guess	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy	1
will	1
keep	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
Green	1
Forest,	1
and	1
we	1
won't	1
have	1
to	1
be	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
watching	1
out	1
for	1
him,"	1
said	1
Bobby	1
Coon,	1
as	1
he	1
washed	1
his	1
dinner	1
in	1
the	1
Laughing	1
Brook,	1
for	1
you	1
know	1
he	1
is	1
very	1
neat	1
and	1
particular.	1
"And	1
he	1
won't	1
dare	1
set	1
any	1
more	1
traps	1
for	1
me,"	1
gloated	1
Billy	1
Mink.	1
"Ah	1
wish	1
Brer	1
Bear	1
would	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
henhouse	1
and	1
scare	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
keep	1
away	1
from	1
there.	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
favor	1
to	1
me	1
which	1
Ah	1
cert'nly	1
would	1
appreciate,"	1
said	1
Unc'	1
Billy	1
Possum	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
news.	1
"Let's	1
all	1
go	1
together	1
and	1
tell	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
how	1
much	1
obliged	1
we	1
are	1
for	1
what	1
he	1
has	1
done,"	1
proposed	1
Jerry	1
Muskrat.	1
"That's	1
a	1
splendid	1
idea!"	1
cried	1
Little	1
Joe	1
Otter.	1
"We'll	1
do	1
it	1
right	1
away."	1
"Caw,	1
caw	1
caw!"	1
broke	1
in	1
Blacky	1
the	1
Crow.	1
"I	1
say,	1
let's	1
wait	1
and	1
see	1
for	1
ourselves	1
if	1
it	1
is	1
all	1
true."	1
"Of	1
course	1
it's	1
true!"	1
snapped	1
Little	1
Joe	1
Otter.	1
"Don't	1
you	1
believe	1
I'm	1
telling	1
the	1
truth?"	1
"Certainly,	1
certainly.	1
Of	1
course	1
no	1
one	1
doubts	1
your	1
word,"	1
replied	1
Blacky,	1
with	1
the	1
utmost	1
politeness.	1
"But	1
you	1
say	1
yourself	1
that	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy	1
didn't	1
see	1
Buster	1
Bear,	1
but	1
only	1
his	1
footprint.	1
Perhaps	1
he	1
didn't	1
know	1
whose	1
it	1
was,	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
he	1
wouldn't	1
have	1
been	1
afraid.	1
Now	1
I've	1
got	1
a	1
plan	1
by	1
which	1
we	1
can	1
see	1
for	1
ourselves	1
if	1
he	1
really	1
is	1
afraid	1
of	1
Buster	1
Bear."	1
"What	1
is	1
it?"	1
asked	1
Sammy	1
Jay	1
eagerly.	1
Blacky	1
the	1
Crow	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
winked.	1
"That's	1
telling,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"I	1
want	1
to	1
think	1
it	1
over.	1
If	1
you	1
meet	1
me	1
at	1
the	1
Big	1
Hickory-tree	1
at	1
sun-up	1
to-morrow	1
morning,	1
and	1
get	1
everybody	1
else	1
to	1
come	1
that	1
you	1
can,	1
perhaps	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
you."	1
XI	1
BLACKY	1
THE	1
CROW	1
TELLS	1
HIS	1
PLAN	1
Blacky	1
is	1
a	1
dreamer!	1
Blacky	1
is	1
a	1
schemer!	1
His	1
voice	1
is	1
strong;	1
When	1
things	1
go	1
wrong	1
Blacky	1
is	1
a	1
screamer!	1
It's	1
a	1
fact.	1
Blacky	1
the	1
Crow	1
is	1
forever	1
dreaming	1
and	1
scheming	1
and	1
almost	1
always	1
it	1
is	1
of	1
mischief.	1
He	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
smartest	1
and	1
cleverest	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
little	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
Green	1
Meadows	1
and	1
the	1
Green	1
Forest,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
others	1
know	1
it.	1
Blacky	1
likes	1
excitement.	1
He	1
wants	1
something	1
going	1
on.	1
The	1
more	1
exciting	1
it	1
is,	1
the	1
better	1
he	1
likes	1
it.	1
Then	1
he	1
has	1
a	1
chance	1
to	1
use	1
that	1
harsh	1
voice	1
of	1
his,	1
and	1
how	1
he	1
does	1
use	1
it!	1
So	1
now,	1
as	1
he	1
sat	1
in	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
Big	1
Hickory-tree	1
beside	1
the	1
Smiling	1
Pool	1
and	1
looked	1
down	1
on	1
all	1
the	1
little	1
people	1
gathered	1
there,	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
happy.	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
place	1
he	1
felt	1
very	1
important,	1
and	1
you	1
know	1
Blacky	1
dearly	1
loves	1
to	1
feel	1
important.	1
They	1
had	1
all	1
come	1
at	1
his	1
invitation	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
a	1
plan	1
for	1
seeing	1
for	1
themselves	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
really	1
true	1
that	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
Buster	1
Bear.	1
On	1
the	1
Big	1
Rock	1
in	1
the	1
Smiling	1
Pool	1
sat	1
Little	1
Joe	1
Otter,	1
Billy	1
Mink,	1
and	1
Jerry	1
Muskrat.	1
On	1
his	1
big,	1
green	1
lily-pad	1
sat	1
Grandfather	1
Frog.	1
On	1
another	1
lily-pad	1
sat	1
Spotty	1
the	1
Turtle.	1
On	1
the	1
bank	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
Smiling	1
Pool	1
were	1
Peter	1
Rabbit,	1
Jumper	1
the	1
Hare,	1
Danny	1
Meadow	1
Mouse,	1
Johnny	1
Chuck,	1
Jimmy	1
Skunk,	1
Unc'	1
Billy	1
Possum,	1
Striped	1
Chipmunk	1
and	1
Old	1
Mr.	1
Toad.	1
On	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
Smiling	1
Pool	1
were	1
Reddy	1
Fox,	1
Digger	1
the	1
Badger,	1
and	1
Bobby	1
Coon.	1
In	1
the	1
Big	1
Hickory-tree	1
were	1
Chatterer	1
the	1
Red	1
Squirrel,	1
Happy	1
Jack	1
the	1
Gray	1
Squirrel,	1
and	1
Sammy	1
Jay.	1
Blacky	1
waited	1
until	1
he	1
was	1
sure	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
else	1
was	1
coming.	1
Then	1
he	1
cleared	1
his	1
throat	1
very	1
loudly	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
speak.	1
"Friends,"	1
said	1
he.	1
Everybody	1
grinned,	1
for	1
Blacky	1
has	1
played	1
so	1
many	1
sharp	1
tricks	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
is	1
really	1
his	1
friend	1
unless	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
other	1
mischief-maker,	1
Sammy	1
Jay,	1
who,	1
you	1
know,	1
is	1
Blacky's	1
cousin.	1
But	1
no	1
one	1
said	1
anything,	1
and	1
Blacky	1
went	1
on.	1
"Little	1
Joe	1
Otter	1
has	1
told	1
us	1
how	1
he	1
saw	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy	1
hurry	1
home	1
when	1
he	1
found	1
the	1
footprint	1
of	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
on	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
Laughing	1
Brook,	1
and	1
how	1
all	1
the	1
way	1
he	1
kept	1
looking	1
behind	1
him,	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
afraid.	1
Perhaps	1
he	1
was,	1
and	1
then	1
again	1
perhaps	1
he	1
wasn't.	1
Perhaps	1
he	1
had	1
something	1
else	1
on	1
his	1
mind.	1
You	1
have	1
made	1
a	1
hero	1
of	1
Buster	1
Bear,	1
because	1
you	1
believe	1
Little	1
Joe's	1
story.	1
Now	1
I	1
don't	1
say	1
that	1
I	1
don't	1
believe	1
it,	1
but	1
I	1
do	1
say	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
lot	1
more	1
sure	1
that	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy	1
is	1
afraid	1
of	1
Buster	1
when	1
I	1
see	1
him	1
run	1
away	1
myself.	1
Now	1
here	1
is	1
my	1
plan:	1
"To-morrow	1
morning,	1
very	1
early,	1
Sammy	1
Jay	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
a	1
great	1
fuss	1
near	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
Green	1
Forest.	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy	1
has	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
curiosity,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
sure	1
to	1
come	1
over	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
all	1
about.	1
Then	1
we	1
will	1
lead	1
him	1
to	1
where	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
is.	1
If	1
he	1
runs	1
away,	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
admit	1
that	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
is	1
as	1
great	1
a	1
hero	1
as	1
some	1
of	1
you	1
seem	1
to	1
think	1
he	1
is.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
simple	1
plan,	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
all	1
hide	1
where	1
you	1
can	1
watch,	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
see	1
for	1
yourselves	1
if	1
Little	1
Joe	1
Otter	1
is	1
right.	1
Now	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
say?"	1
Right	1
away	1
everybody	1
began	1
to	1
talk	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time.	1
It	1
was	1
such	1
a	1
simple	1
plan	1
that	1
everybody	1
agreed	1
to	1
it.	1
And	1
it	1
promised	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
exciting	1
that	1
everybody	1
promised	1
to	1
be	1
there,	1
that	1
is,	1
everybody	1
but	1
Grandfather	1
Frog	1
and	1
Spotty	1
the	1
Turtle,	1
who	1
didn't	1
care	1
to	1
go	1
so	1
far	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
Smiling	1
Pool.	1
So	1
it	1
was	1
agreed	1
that	1
Blacky	1
should	1
try	1
his	1
plan	1
the	1
very	1
next	1
morning.	1
XII	1
FARMER	1
BROWN'S	1
BOY	1
AND	1
BUSTER	1
BEAR	1
GROW	1
CURIOUS	1
Ever	1
since	1
it	1
was	1
light	1
enough	1
to	1
see	1
at	1
all,	1
Blacky	1
the	1
Crow	1
had	1
been	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
tallest	1
tree	1
on	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
Green	1
Forest	1
nearest	1
to	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
house,	1
and	1
never	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
had	1
he	1
taken	1
his	1
eyes	1
from	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
back	1
door.	1
What	1
was	1
he	1
watching	1
for?	1
Why,	1
for	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy	1
to	1
come	1
out	1
on	1
his	1
way	1
to	1
milk	1
the	1
cows.	1
Meanwhile,	1
Sammy	1
Jay	1
was	1
slipping	1
silently	1
through	1
the	1
Green	1
Forest,	1
looking	1
for	1
Buster	1
Bear,	1
so	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
time	1
came	1
he	1
could	1
let	1
his	1
cousin,	1
Blacky	1
the	1
Crow,	1
know	1
just	1
where	1
Buster	1
was.	1
By	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
back	1
door	1
of	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
house	1
opened,	1
and	1
out	1
stepped	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy.	1
In	1
each	1
hand	1
he	1
carried	1
a	1
milk	1
pail.	1
Right	1
away	1
Blacky	1
began	1
to	1
scream	1
at	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
his	1
lungs.	1
"Caw,	1
caw,	1
caw!"	1
shouted	1
Blacky.	1
"Caw,	1
caw,	1
caw!"	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
he	1
flew	1
about	1
among	1
the	1
trees	1
near	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
Green	1
Forest	1
as	1
if	1
so	1
excited	1
that	1
he	1
couldn't	1
keep	1
still.	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy	1
looked	1
over	1
there	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
wondered	1
what	1
all	1
that	1
fuss	1
was	1
about,	1
as	1
indeed	1
he	1
did,	1
but	1
he	1
didn't	1
start	1
to	1
go	1
over	1
and	1
see.	1
No,	1
Sir,	1
he	1
started	1
straight	1
for	1
the	1
barn.	1
Blacky	1
didn't	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
make	1
of	1
it.	1
You	1
see,	1
smart	1
as	1
he	1
is	1
and	1
shrewd	1
as	1
he	1
is,	1
Blacky	1
doesn't	1
know	1
anything	1
about	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
duty,	1
for	1
he	1
never	1
has	1
to	1
work	1
excepting	1
to	1
get	1
enough	1
to	1
eat.	1
So,	1
when	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy	1
started	1
for	1
the	1
barn	1
instead	1
of	1
for	1
the	1
Green	1
Forest,	1
Blacky	1
didn't	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
make	1
of	1
it.	1
He	1
screamed	1
harder	1
and	1
louder	1
than	1
ever,	1
until	1
his	1
voice	1
grew	1
so	1
hoarse	1
he	1
couldn't	1
scream	1
any	1
more,	1
but	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy	1
kept	1
right	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
barn.	1
"I'd	1
like	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
you're	1
making	1
such	1
a	1
fuss	1
about,	1
Mr.	1
Crow,	1
but	1
I've	1
got	1
to	1
feed	1
the	1
cows	1
and	1
milk	1
them	1
first,"	1
said	1
he.	1
Now	1
all	1
this	1
time	1
the	1
other	1
little	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
Green	1
Forest	1
and	1
the	1
Green	1
Meadows	1
had	1
been	1
hiding	1
where	1
they	1
could	1
see	1
all	1
that	1
went	1
on.	1
When	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy	1
disappeared	1
in	1
the	1
barn,	1
Chatterer	1
the	1
Red	1
Squirrel	1
snickered	1
right	1
out	1
loud.	1
"Ha,	1
ha,	1
ha!	1
This	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
plan	1
of	1
yours,	1
Blacky!	1
Ha,	1
ha,	1
ha!"	1
he	1
shouted.	1
Blacky	1
couldn't	1
find	1
a	1
word	1
to	1
say.	1
He	1
just	1
hung	1
his	1
head,	1
which	1
is	1
something	1
Blacky	1
seldom	1
does.	1
"Perhaps	1
if	1
we	1
wait	1
until	1
he	1
comes	1
out	1
again,	1
he	1
will	1
come	1
over	1
here,"	1
said	1
Sammy	1
Jay,	1
who	1
had	1
joined	1
Blacky.	1
So	1
it	1
was	1
decided	1
to	1
wait.	1
It	1
seemed	1
as	1
if	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy	1
never	1
would	1
come	1
out,	1
but	1
at	1
last	1
he	1
did.	1
Blacky	1
and	1
Sammy	1
Jay	1
at	1
once	1
began	1
to	1
scream	1
and	1
make	1
all	1
the	1
fuss	1
they	1
could.	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy	1
took	1
the	1
two	1
pails	1
of	1
milk	1
into	1
the	1
house,	1
then	1
out	1
he	1
came	1
and	1
started	1
straight	1
for	1
the	1
Green	1
Forest.	1
He	1
was	1
so	1
curious	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
it	1
all	1
meant	1
that	1
he	1
couldn't	1
wait	1
another	1
minute.	1
Now	1
there	1
was	1
some	1
one	1
else	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
curiosity	1
also.	1
He	1
had	1
heard	1
the	1
screaming	1
of	1
Blacky	1
the	1
Crow	1
and	1
Sammy	1
Jay,	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
listened	1
until	1
he	1
couldn't	1
stand	1
it	1
another	1
minute.	1
He	1
just	1
_had_	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
about.	1
So	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy	1
started	1
for	1
the	1
Green	1
Forest,	1
this	1
other	1
listener	1
started	1
towards	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
Blacky	1
and	1
Sammy	1
were	1
making	1
such	1
a	1
racket.	1
He	1
walked	1
very	1
softly	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
sound.	1
It	1
was	1
Buster	1
Bear.	1
XIII	1
FARMER	1
BROWN'S	1
BOY	1
AND	1
BUSTER	1
BEAR	1
MEET	1
If	1
you	1
should	1
meet	1
with	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
While	1
walking	1
through	1
the	1
wood,	1
What	1
would	1
you	1
do?	1
Now	1
tell	1
me	1
true,	1
_I'd_	1
run	1
the	1
best	1
I	1
could.	1
That	1
is	1
what	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy	1
did	1
when	1
he	1
met	1
Buster	1
Bear,	1
and	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
Green	1
Forest	1
and	1
some	1
from	1
the	1
Green	1
Meadows	1
saw	1
him.	1
When	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy	1
came	1
hurrying	1
home	1
from	1
the	1
Laughing	1
Brook	1
without	1
any	1
fish	1
one	1
day	1
and	1
told	1
about	1
the	1
great	1
footprint	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
in	1
a	1
muddy	1
place	1
on	1
the	1
bank	1
deep	1
in	1
the	1
Green	1
Forest,	1
and	1
had	1
said	1
his	1
was	1
sure	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
footprint	1
of	1
a	1
Bear,	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
laughed	1
at.	1
Farmer	1
Brown	1
had	1
laughed	1
and	1
laughed.	1
"Why,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"there	1
hasn't	1
been	1
a	1
Bear	1
in	1
the	1
Green	1
Forest	1
for	1
years	1
and	1
years	1
and	1
years,	1
not	1
since	1
my	1
own	1
grandfather	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
boy,	1
and	1
that,	1
you	1
know,	1
was	1
a	1
long,	1
long,	1
long	1
time	1
ago.	1
If	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
find	1
Mr.	1
Bear,	1
you	1
will	1
have	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
Great	1
Woods.	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
who	1
made	1
that	1
footprint,	1
but	1
it	1
certainly	1
couldn't	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
Bear.	1
I	1
think	1
you	1
must	1
have	1
imagined	1
it."	1
Then	1
he	1
had	1
laughed	1
some	1
more,	1
all	1
of	1
which	1
goes	1
to	1
show	1
how	1
easy	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
mistaken,	1
and	1
how	1
foolish	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
laugh	1
at	1
things	1
you	1
really	1
don't	1
know	1
about.	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
_had_	1
come	1
to	1
live	1
in	1
the	1
Green	1
Forest,	1
and	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy	1
_had_	1
seen	1
his	1
footprint.	1
But	1
Farmer	1
Brown	1
laughed	1
so	1
much	1
and	1
made	1
fun	1
of	1
him	1
so	1
much,	1
that	1
at	1
last	1
his	1
boy	1
began	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
mistaken	1
after	1
all.	1
So	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
Blacky	1
the	1
Crow	1
and	1
Sammy	1
Jay	1
making	1
a	1
great	1
fuss	1
near	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
Green	1
Forest,	1
he	1
never	1
once	1
thought	1
of	1
Buster	1
Bear,	1
as	1
he	1
started	1
over	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
was	1
going	1
on.	1
When	1
Blacky	1
and	1
Sammy	1
saw	1
him	1
coming,	1
they	1
moved	1
a	1
little	1
farther	1
in	1
to	1
the	1
Green	1
Forest,	1
still	1
screaming	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
excited	1
way.	1
They	1
felt	1
sure	1
that	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy	1
would	1
follow	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
meant	1
to	1
lead	1
him	1
to	1
where	1
Sammy	1
had	1
seen	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
that	1
morning.	1
Then	1
they	1
would	1
find	1
out	1
for	1
sure	1
if	1
what	1
Little	1
Joe	1
Otter	1
had	1
said	1
was	1
true,--that	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy	1
really	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
Buster	1
Bear.	1
Now	1
all	1
around,	1
behind	1
trees	1
and	1
stumps,	1
and	1
under	1
thick	1
branches,	1
and	1
even	1
in	1
tree	1
tops,	1
were	1
other	1
little	1
people	1
watching	1
with	1
round,	1
wide-open	1
eyes	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
would	1
happen.	1
It	1
was	1
very	1
exciting,	1
the	1
most	1
exciting	1
thing	1
they	1
could	1
remember.	1
You	1
see,	1
they	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy	1
wasn't	1
afraid	1
of	1
anybody	1
or	1
anything,	1
and	1
as	1
most	1
of	1
them	1
were	1
very	1
much	1
afraid	1
of	1
him,	1
they	1
had	1
hard	1
work	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
really	1
be	1
afraid	1
of	1
even	1
such	1
a	1
great,	1
big,	1
strong	1
fellow	1
as	1
Buster	1
Bear.	1
Every	1
one	1
was	1
so	1
busy	1
watching	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
saw	1
Buster	1
coming	1
from	1
the	1
other	1
direction.	1
You	1
see,	1
Buster	1
walked	1
very	1
softly.	1
Big	1
as	1
he	1
is,	1
he	1
can	1
walk	1
without	1
making	1
the	1
teeniest,	1
weeniest	1
sound.	1
And	1
that	1
is	1
how	1
it	1
happened	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
saw	1
him	1
or	1
heard	1
him	1
until	1
just	1
as	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy	1
stepped	1
out	1
from	1
behind	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
a	1
thick	1
little	1
hemlock-tree,	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
stepped	1
out	1
from	1
behind	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
that	1
same	1
little	1
tree,	1
and	1
there	1
they	1
were	1
face	1
to	1
face!	1
Then	1
everybody	1
held	1
their	1
breath,	1
even	1
Blacky	1
the	1
Crow	1
and	1
Sammy	1
Jay.	1
For	1
just	1
a	1
little	1
minute	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
still	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
Green	1
Forest	1
that	1
not	1
the	1
least	1
little	1
sound	1
could	1
be	1
heard.	1
What	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
happen?	1
XIV	1
A	1
SURPRISING	1
THING	1
HAPPENS	1
Blacky	1
the	1
Crow	1
and	1
Sammy	1
Jay,	1
looking	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
a	1
tall	1
tree,	1
held	1
their	1
breath.	1
Happy	1
Jack	1
the	1
Gray	1
Squirrel	1
and	1
his	1
cousin,	1
Chatterer	1
the	1
Red	1
Squirrel,	1
looking	1
down	1
from	1
another	1
tree,	1
held	1
_their_	1
breath.	1
Unc'	1
Billy	1
Possum,	1
sticking	1
his	1
head	1
out	1
from	1
a	1
hollow	1
tree,	1
held	1
_his_	1
breath.	1
Bobby	1
Coon,	1
looking	1
through	1
a	1
hole	1
in	1
a	1
hollow	1
stump	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
hiding,	1
held	1
_his_	1
breath.	1
Reddy	1
Fox,	1
lying	1
flat	1
down	1
behind	1
a	1
heap	1
of	1
brush,	1
held	1
_his_	1
breath.	1
Peter	1
Rabbit,	1
sitting	1
bolt	1
upright	1
under	1
a	1
thick	1
hemlock	1
branch,	1
with	1
eyes	1
and	1
ears	1
wide	1
open,	1
held	1
_his_	1
breath.	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
other	1
little	1
people	1
who	1
happened	1
to	1
be	1
where	1
they	1
could	1
see	1
did	1
the	1
same	1
thing.	1
You	1
see,	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
most	1
exciting	1
moment	1
ever	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
Green	1
Forest.	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy	1
had	1
just	1
stepped	1
out	1
from	1
behind	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
a	1
little	1
hemlock-tree	1
and	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
had	1
just	1
stepped	1
out	1
from	1
behind	1
the	1
opposite	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
hemlock-tree	1
and	1
neither	1
had	1
known	1
that	1
the	1
other	1
was	1
anywhere	1
near.	1
For	1
a	1
whole	1
minute	1
they	1
stood	1
there	1
face	1
to	1
face,	1
gazing	1
into	1
each	1
other's	1
eyes,	1
while	1
everybody	1
watched	1
and	1
waited,	1
and	1
it	1
seemed	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
whole	1
Green	1
Forest	1
was	1
holding	1
its	1
breath.	1
Then	1
something	1
happened.	1
Yes,	1
Sir,	1
something	1
happened.	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy	1
opened	1
his	1
mouth	1
and	1
yelled!	1
It	1
was	1
such	1
a	1
sudden	1
yell	1
and	1
such	1
a	1
loud	1
yell	1
that	1
it	1
startled	1
Chatterer	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
nearly	1
fell	1
from	1
his	1
place	1
in	1
the	1
tree,	1
and	1
it	1
made	1
Reddy	1
Fox	1
jump	1
to	1
his	1
feet	1
ready	1
to	1
run.	1
And	1
that	1
yell	1
was	1
a	1
yell	1
of	1
fright.	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
doubt	1
about	1
it,	1
for	1
with	1
the	1
yell	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy	1
turned	1
and	1
ran	1
for	1
home,	1
as	1
no	1
one	1
ever	1
had	1
seen	1
him	1
run	1
before.	1
He	1
ran	1
just	1
as	1
Peter	1
Rabbit	1
runs	1
when	1
he	1
has	1
got	1
to	1
reach	1
the	1
dear	1
Old	1
Briar-patch	1
before	1
Reddy	1
Fox	1
can	1
catch	1
him,	1
which,	1
you	1
know,	1
is	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
he	1
can	1
run.	1
Once	1
he	1
stumbled	1
and	1
fell,	1
but	1
he	1
scrambled	1
to	1
his	1
feet	1
in	1
a	1
twinkling,	1
and	1
away	1
he	1
went	1
without	1
once	1
turning	1
his	1
head	1
to	1
see	1
if	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
was	1
after	1
him.	1
There	1
wasn't	1
any	1
doubt	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
afraid,	1
very	1
much	1
afraid.	1
Everybody	1
leaned	1
forward	1
to	1
watch	1
him.	1
"What	1
did	1
I	1
tell	1
you?	1
Didn't	1
I	1
say	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
Buster	1
Bear?"	1
cried	1
Little	1
Joe	1
Otter,	1
dancing	1
about	1
with	1
excitement.	1
"You	1
were	1
right,	1
Little	1
Joe!	1
I'm	1
sorry	1
that	1
I	1
doubted	1
it.	1
See	1
him	1
go!	1
Caw,	1
caw,	1
caw!"	1
shrieked	1
Blacky	1
the	1
Crow.	1
For	1
a	1
minute	1
or	1
two	1
everybody	1
forgot	1
about	1
Buster	1
Bear.	1
Then	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
crash	1
which	1
made	1
everybody	1
turn	1
to	1
look	1
the	1
other	1
way.	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
they	1
saw?	1
Why,	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
was	1
running	1
away	1
too,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
running	1
twice	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy!	1
He	1
bumped	1
into	1
trees	1
and	1
crashed	1
through	1
bushes	1
and	1
jumped	1
over	1
logs,	1
and	1
in	1
almost	1
no	1
time	1
at	1
all	1
he	1
was	1
out	1
of	1
sight.	1
Altogether	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
most	1
surprising	1
thing	1
that	1
the	1
little	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
Green	1
Forest	1
ever	1
had	1
seen.	1

Sammy	1

looked	1
at	1
Blacky	1
the	1
Crow,	1
and	1
Blacky	1
looked	1
at	1
Chatterer,	1

Chatterer	1
looked	1
at	1

looked	1

and	1
Billy	1
looked	1
at	1
Little	1
Joe	1
Otter,	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
minute	1
nobody	1
could	1
say	1
a	1
word.	1
Then	1
Little	1
Joe	1
gave	1
a	1
funny	1
little	1
gasp.	1
"Why,	1
why-e-e!"	1
said	1
he,	1
"I	1
believe	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
is	1
afraid	1
too!"	1
Unc'	1
Billy	1
Possum	1
chuckled.	1
"Ah	1
believe	1
yo'	1
are	1
right	1
again,	1
Brer	1
Otter,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"It	1
cert'nly	1
does	1
look	1
so.	1
If	1
Brer	1
Bear	1
isn't	1
scared,	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
remembered	1
something	1
impo'tant	1
and	1
has	1
gone	1
to	1
attend	1
to	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
powerful	1
hurry."	1
Then	1
everybody	1
began	1
to	1
laugh.	1
XV	1
BUSTER	1
BEAR	1
IS	1
A	1
FALLEN	1
HERO	1
A	1
fallen	1
hero	1
is	1
some	1
one	1
to	1
whom	1
every	1
one	1
has	1
looked	1
up	1
as	1
very	1
brave	1
and	1
then	1
proves	1
to	1
be	1
less	1
brave	1
than	1
he	1
was	1
supposed	1
to	1
be.	1
That	1
was	1
the	1
way	1
with	1
Buster	1
Bear.	1
When	1
Little	1
Joe	1
Otter	1
had	1
told	1
how	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy	1
had	1
been	1
afraid	1
at	1
the	1
mere	1
sight	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
Buster	1
Bear's	1
big	1
footprints,	1
they	1
had	1
at	1
once	1
made	1
a	1
hero	1
of	1
Buster.	1
At	1
least	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
had.	1
As	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
time,	1
the	1
very	1
first	1
time,	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
ever	1
known	1
any	1
one	1
who	1
lives	1
in	1
the	1
Green	1
Forest	1
to	1
make	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy	1
run	1
away,	1
they	1
looked	1
on	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
respect	1
and	1
were	1
very	1
proud	1
of	1
him.	1
But	1
now	1
they	1
had	1
seen	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
and	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy	1
meet	1
face	1
to	1
face;	1
and	1
while	1
it	1
was	1
true	1
that	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy	1
had	1
run	1
away	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
ever	1
he	1
could,	1
it	1
was	1
also	1
true	1
that	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
had	1
done	1
the	1
same	1
thing.	1
He	1
had	1
run	1
even	1
faster	1
than	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy,	1
and	1
had	1
hidden	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
lonely	1
place	1
he	1
could	1
find	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
deepest	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
Green	1
Forest.	1
It	1
was	1
hard	1
to	1
believe,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
true.	1
And	1
right	1
away	1
everybody	1
lost	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
the	1
respect	1
for	1
Buster	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
felt.	1
It	1
is	1
always	1
that	1
way.	1
They	1
began	1
to	1
say	1
unkind	1
things	1
about	1
him.	1
They	1
said	1
them	1
among	1
themselves,	1
and	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
even	1
said	1
them	1
to	1
Buster	1
when	1
they	1
met	1
him,	1
or	1
said	1
them	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
hear	1
them.	1
Of	1
course	1
Blacky	1
the	1
Crow	1
and	1
Sammy	1
Jay,	1
who,	1
because	1
they	1
can	1
fly,	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
fear	1
from	1
Buster,	1
and	1
who	1
always	1
delight	1
in	1
making	1
other	1
people	1
uncomfortable,	1
never	1
let	1
a	1
chance	1
go	1
by	1
to	1
tell	1
Buster	1
and	1
everybody	1
else	1
within	1
hearing	1
what	1
they	1
thought	1
of	1
him.	1
They	1
delighted	1
in	1
flying	1
about	1
through	1
the	1
Green	1
Forest	1
until	1
they	1
had	1
found	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
and	1
then	1
from	1
the	1
safety	1
of	1
the	1
tree	1
tops	1
screaming	1
at	1
him.	1
"Buster	1
Bear	1
is	1
big	1
and	1
strong;	1
His	1
teeth	1
are	1
big;	1
his	1
claws	1
are	1
long;	1
In	1
spite	1
of	1
these	1
he	1
runs	1
away	1
And	1
hides	1
himself	1
the	1
livelong	1
day!"	1
A	1
dozen	1
times	1
a	1
day	1
Buster	1
would	1
hear	1
them	1
screaming	1
this.	1
He	1
would	1
grind	1
his	1
teeth	1
and	1
glare	1
up	1
at	1
them,	1
but	1
that	1
was	1
all	1
he	1
could	1
do.	1
He	1
couldn't	1
get	1
at	1
them.	1
He	1
just	1
had	1
to	1
stand	1
it	1
and	1
do	1
nothing.	1
But	1
when	1
impudent	1
little	1
Chatterer	1
the	1
Red	1
Squirrel	1
shouted	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
from	1
a	1
place	1
just	1
out	1
of	1
reach	1
in	1
a	1
big	1
pine-tree,	1
Buster	1
could	1
stand	1
it	1
no	1
longer.	1
He	1
gave	1
a	1
deep,	1
angry	1
growl	1
that	1
made	1
little	1
shivers	1
run	1
over	1
Chatterer,	1
and	1
then	1
suddenly	1
he	1
started	1
up	1
that	1
tree	1
after	1
Chatterer.	1
With	1
a	1
frightened	1
little	1
shriek	1
Chatterer	1
scampered	1
to	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
tree.	1
He	1
hadn't	1
known	1
that	1
Buster	1
could	1
climb.	1
But	1
Buster	1
is	1
a	1
splendid	1
climber,	1
especially	1
when	1
the	1
tree	1
is	1
big	1
and	1
stout	1
as	1
this	1
one	1
was,	1
and	1
now	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
after	1
Chatterer,	1
growling	1
angrily.	1
How	1
Chatterer	1
did	1
wish	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
kept	1
his	1
tongue	1
still!	1
He	1
ran	1
to	1
the	1
very	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
tree,	1
so	1
frightened	1
that	1
his	1
teeth	1
chattered,	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
looked	1
down	1
and	1
saw	1
Buster's	1
great	1
mouth	1
coming	1
nearer	1
and	1
nearer,	1
he	1
nearly	1
tumbled	1
down	1
with	1
terror.	1
The	1
worst	1
of	1
it	1
was	1
there	1
wasn't	1
another	1
tree	1
near	1
enough	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
jump	1
to.	1
He	1
was	1
in	1
trouble	1
this	1
time,	1
was	1
Chatterer,	1
sure	1
enough!	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
help	1
him.	1
XVI	1
CHATTERER	1
THE	1
RED	1
SQUIRREL	1
JUMPS	1
FOR	1
HIS	1
LIFE	1
It	1
isn't	1
very	1
often	1
that	1
Chatterer	1
the	1
Red	1
Squirrel	1
knows	1
fear.	1
That	1
is	1
one	1
reason	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
so	1
often	1
impudent	1
and	1
saucy.	1
But	1
once	1
in	1
a	1
while	1
a	1
great	1
fear	1
takes	1
possession	1
of	1
him,	1
as	1
when	1
he	1
knows	1
that	1
Shadow	1
the	1
Weasel	1
is	1
looking	1
for	1
him.	1
You	1
see,	1
he	1
knows	1
that	1
Shadow	1
can	1
go	1
wherever	1
he	1
can	1
go.	1
There	1
are	1
very	1
few	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
Green	1
Forest	1
and	1
the	1
Green	1
Meadows	1
who	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
fear	1
at	1
some	1
time	1
or	1
other,	1
but	1
it	1
comes	1
to	1
Chatterer	1
as	1
seldom	1
as	1
to	1
any	1
one,	1
because	1
he	1
is	1
very	1
sure	1
of	1
himself	1
and	1
his	1
ability	1
to	1
hide	1
or	1
run	1
away	1
from	1
danger.	1
But	1
now	1
as	1
he	1
clung	1
to	1
a	1
little	1
branch	1
near	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
a	1
tall	1
pine-tree	1
in	1
the	1
Green	1
Forest	1
and	1
looked	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
big	1
sharp	1
teeth	1
of	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
drawing	1
nearer	1
and	1
nearer,	1
and	1
listened	1
to	1
the	1
deep,	1
angry	1
growls	1
that	1
made	1
his	1
hair	1
stand	1
on	1
end,	1
Chatterer	1
was	1
too	1
frightened	1
to	1
think.	1
If	1
only	1
he	1
had	1
kept	1
his	1
tongue	1
still	1
instead	1
of	1
saying	1
hateful	1
things	1
to	1
Buster	1
Bear!	1
If	1
only	1
he	1
had	1
known	1
that	1
Buster	1
could	1
climb	1
a	1
tree!	1
If	1
only	1
he	1
had	1
chosen	1
a	1
tree	1
near	1
enough	1
to	1
other	1
trees	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
jump	1
across!	1
But	1
he	1
_had_	1
said	1
hateful	1
things,	1
he	1
_had_	1
chosen	1
to	1
sit	1
in	1
a	1
tree	1
which	1
stood	1
quite	1
by	1
itself,	1
and	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
_could_	1
climb!	1
Chatterer	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
worst	1
kind	1
of	1
trouble,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
blame	1
but	1
himself.	1
That	1
is	1
usually	1
the	1
case	1
with	1
those	1
who	1
get	1
into	1
trouble.	1
Nearer	1
and	1
nearer	1
came	1
Buster	1
Bear,	1
and	1
deeper	1
and	1
angrier	1
sounded	1
his	1
voice.	1
Chatterer	1
gave	1
a	1
little	1
frightened	1
gasp	1
and	1
looked	1
this	1
way	1
and	1
looked	1
that	1
way.	1
What	1
should	1
he	1
do?	1
What	1
_could_	1
he	1
do!	1
The	1
ground	1
seemed	1
a	1
terrible	1
distance	1
below.	1
If	1
only	1
he	1
had	1
wings	1
like	1
Sammy	1
Jay!	1
But	1
he	1
hadn't.	1
"Gr-r-r-r!"	1
growled	1
Buster	1
Bear.	1
"I'll	1
teach	1
you	1
manners!	1
I'll	1
teach	1
you	1
to	1
treat	1
your	1
betters	1
with	1
respect!	1
I'll	1
swallow	1
you	1
whole,	1
that's	1
what	1
I'll	1
do.	1
Gr-r-r-r!"	1
"Oh!"	1
cried	1
Chatterer.	1
"Gr-r-r-r!	1
I'll	1
eat	1
you	1
all	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
last	1
hair	1
on	1
your	1
tail!"	1
growled	1
Buster,	1
scrambling	1
a	1
little	1
nearer.	1
"Oh!	1
Oh!"	1
cried	1
Chatterer,	1
and	1
ran	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
very	1
tip	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
branch	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
clinging.	1
Now	1
if	1
Chatterer	1
had	1
only	1
known	1
it,	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
couldn't	1
reach	1
him	1
way	1
up	1
there,	1
because	1
the	1
tree	1
was	1
too	1
small	1
at	1
the	1
top	1
for	1
such	1
a	1
big	1
fellow	1
as	1
Buster.	1
But	1
Chatterer	1
didn't	1
think	1
of	1
that.	1
He	1
gave	1
one	1
more	1
frightened	1
look	1
down	1
at	1
those	1
big	1
teeth,	1
then	1
he	1
shut	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
jumped--jumped	1
straight	1
out	1
for	1
the	1
far-away	1
ground.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
long,	1
long,	1
long	1
way	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
it	1
certainly	1
looked	1
as	1
if	1
such	1
a	1
little	1
fellow	1
as	1
Chatterer	1
must	1
be	1
killed.	1
But	1
Chatterer	1
had	1
learned	1
from	1
Old	1
Mother	1
Nature	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
given	1
him	1
certain	1
things	1
to	1
help	1
him	1
at	1
just	1
such	1
times,	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
is	1
the	1
power	1
to	1
spread	1
himself	1
very	1
flat.	1
He	1
did	1
it	1
now.	1
He	1
spread	1
his	1
arms	1
and	1
legs	1
out	1
just	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
he	1
could,	1
and	1
that	1
kept	1
him	1
from	1
falling	1
as	1
fast	1
and	1
as	1
hard	1
as	1
he	1
otherwise	1
would	1
have	1
done,	1
because	1
being	1
spread	1
out	1
so	1
flat	1
that	1
way,	1
the	1
air	1
held	1
him	1
up	1
a	1
little.	1
And	1
then	1
there	1
was	1
his	1
tail,	1
that	1
funny	1
little	1
tail	1
he	1
is	1
so	1
fond	1
of	1
jerking	1
when	1
he	1
scolds.	1
This	1
helped	1
him	1
too.	1
It	1
helped	1
him	1
keep	1
his	1
balance	1
and	1
keep	1
from	1
turning	1
over	1
and	1
over.	1
Down,	1
down,	1
down	1
he	1
sailed	1
and	1
landed	1
on	1
his	1
feet.	1
Of	1
course,	1
he	1
hit	1
the	1
ground	1
pretty	1
hard,	1
and	1
for	1
just	1
a	1
second	1
he	1
quite	1
lost	1
his	1
breath.	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
for	1
a	1
second,	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
was	1
scurrying	1
off	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
a	1
frightened	1
Squirrel	1
could.	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
watched	1
him	1
and	1
grinned.	1
"I	1
didn't	1
catch	1
him	1
that	1
time,"	1
he	1
growled,	1
"but	1
I	1
guess	1
I	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
good	1
fright	1
and	1
taught	1
him	1
a	1
lesson."	1
XVII	1
BUSTER	1
BEAR	1
GOES	1
BERRYING	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
hand	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
himself	1
when	1
he	1
thinks	1
no	1
one	1
is	1
around	1
to	1
overhear.	1
It's	1
a	1
habit.	1
However,	1
it	1
isn't	1
a	1
bad	1
habit	1
unless	1
it	1
is	1
carried	1
too	1
far.	1
Any	1
habit	1
becomes	1
bad,	1
if	1
it	1
is	1
carried	1
too	1
far.	1
Suppose	1
you	1
had	1
a	1
secret,	1
a	1
real	1
secret,	1
something	1
that	1
nobody	1
else	1
knew	1
and	1
that	1
you	1
didn't	1
want	1
anybody	1
else	1
to	1
know.	1
And	1
suppose	1
you	1
had	1
the	1
habit	1
of	1
talking	1
to	1
yourself.	1
You	1
might,	1
without	1
thinking,	1
you	1
know,	1
tell	1
that	1
secret	1
out	1
loud	1
to	1
yourself,	1
and	1
some	1
one	1
might,	1
just	1
might	1
happen	1
to	1
overhear!	1
Then	1
there	1
wouldn't	1
be	1
any	1
secret.	1
That	1
is	1
the	1
way	1
that	1
a	1
habit	1
which	1
isn't	1
bad	1
in	1
itself	1
can	1
become	1
bad	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
carried	1
too	1
far.	1
Now	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
had	1
lived	1
by	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
Great	1
Woods	1
so	1
long	1
that	1
this	1
habit	1
of	1
talking	1
to	1
himself	1
had	1
grown	1
and	1
grown.	1
He	1
did	1
it	1
just	1
to	1
keep	1
from	1
being	1
lonesome.	1
Of	1
course,	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
Green	1
Forest	1
to	1
live,	1
he	1
brought	1
all	1
his	1
habits	1
with	1
him.	1
That	1
is	1
one	1
thing	1
about	1
habits,--you	1
always	1
take	1
them	1
with	1
you	1
wherever	1
you	1
go.	1
So	1
Buster	1
brought	1
this	1
habit	1
of	1
talking	1
to	1
himself	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
Green	1
Forest,	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
many	1
more	1
neighbors	1
than	1
he	1
had	1
in	1
the	1
Great	1
Woods.	1
"Let	1
me	1
see,	1
let	1
me	1
see,	1
what	1
is	1
there	1
to	1
tempt	1
my	1
appetite?"	1
said	1
Buster	1
in	1
his	1
deep,	1
grumbly-rumbly	1
voice.	1
"I	1
find	1
my	1
appetite	1
isn't	1
what	1
it	1
ought	1
to	1
be.	1
I	1
need	1
a	1
change.	1
Yes,	1
Sir,	1
I	1
need	1
a	1
change.	1
There	1
is	1
something	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
of	1
year,	1
and	1
I	1
haven't	1
got	1
it.	1
There	1
is	1
something	1
that	1
I	1
used	1
to	1
have	1
and	1
don't	1
have	1
now.	1
Ha!	1
I	1
know!	1
I	1
need	1
some	1
fresh	1
fruit.	1
That's	1
it--fresh	1
fruit!	1
It	1
must	1
be	1
about	1
berry	1
time	1
now,	1
and	1
I'd	1
forgotten	1
all	1
about	1
it.	1
My,	1
my,	1
my,	1
how	1
good	1
some	1
berries	1
would	1
taste!	1
Now	1
if	1
I	1
were	1
back	1
up	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
Great	1
Woods	1
I	1
could	1
have	1
all	1
I	1
could	1
eat.	1
Um-m-m-m!	1
Makes	1
my	1
mouth	1
water	1
just	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
it.	1
There	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
some	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
Old	1
Pasture.	1
There	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
'em	1
up	1
there.	1
If	1
I	1
wasn't	1
afraid	1
that	1
some	1
one	1
would	1
see	1
me,	1
I'd	1
go	1
up	1
there."	1
Buster	1
sighed.	1
Then	1
he	1
sighed	1
again.	1
The	1
more	1
he	1
thought	1
about	1
those	1
berries	1
he	1
felt	1
sure	1
were	1
growing	1
in	1
the	1
Old	1
Pasture,	1
the	1
more	1
he	1
wanted	1
some.	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
never	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
life	1
had	1
he	1
wanted	1
berries	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
now.	1
He	1
wandered	1
about	1
uneasily.	1
He	1
was	1
hungry--hungry	1
for	1
berries	1
and	1
nothing	1
else.	1
By	1
and	1
by	1
he	1
began	1
talking	1
to	1
himself	1
again.	1
"If	1
I	1
wasn't	1
afraid	1
of	1
being	1
seen,	1
I'd	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
Old	1
Pasture	1
this	1
very	1
minute.	1
Seems	1
as	1
if	1
I	1
could	1
taste	1
those	1
berries."	1
He	1
licked	1
his	1
lips	1
hungrily	1
as	1
he	1
spoke.	1
Then	1
his	1
face	1
brightened.	1
"I	1
know	1
what	1
I'll	1
do!	1
I'll	1
go	1
up	1
there	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
first	1
peep	1
of	1
day	1
to-morrow.	1
I	1
can	1
eat	1
all	1
I	1
want	1
and	1
get	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
Green	1
Forest	1
before	1
there	1
is	1
any	1
danger	1
that	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy	1
or	1
any	1
one	1
else	1
I'm	1
afraid	1
of	1
will	1
see	1
me.	1
That's	1
just	1
what	1
I'll	1
do.	1
My,	1
I	1
wish	1
to-morrow	1
morning	1
would	1
hurry	1
up	1
and	1
come."	1
Now	1
though	1
Buster	1
didn't	1
know	1
it,	1
some	1
one	1
had	1
been	1
listening,	1
and	1
that	1
some	1
one	1
was	1
none	1
other	1
than	1
Sammy	1
Jay.	1
When	1
at	1
last	1
Buster	1
lay	1
down	1
for	1
a	1
nap,	1
Sammy	1
flew	1
away,	1
chuckling	1
to	1
himself.	1
"I	1
believe	1
I'll	1
visit	1
the	1
Old	1
Pasture	1
to-morrow	1
morning	1
myself,"	1
thought	1
he.	1
"I	1
have	1
an	1
idea	1
that	1
something	1
interesting	1
may	1
happen	1
if	1
Buster	1
doesn't	1
change	1
his	1
mind."	1
Sammy	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
lookout	1
very	1
early	1
the	1
next	1
morning.	1
The	1
first	1
Jolly	1
Little	1
Sunbeams	1
had	1
only	1
reached	1
the	1
Green	1
Meadows	1
and	1
had	1
not	1
started	1
to	1
creep	1
into	1
the	1
Green	1
Forest,	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
a	1
big,	1
dark	1
form	1
steal	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
Green	1
Forest	1
where	1
it	1
joins	1
the	1
Old	1
Pasture.	1
It	1
moved	1
very	1
swiftly	1
and	1
silently,	1
as	1
if	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
hurry.	1
Sammy	1
knew	1
who	1
it	1
was:	1
it	1
was	1
Buster	1
Bear,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
berrying.	1
Sammy	1
waited	1
a	1
little	1
until	1
he	1
could	1
see	1
better.	1
Then	1
he	1
too	1
started	1
for	1
the	1
Old	1
Pasture.	1
XVIII	1
SOMEBODY	1
ELSE	1
GOES	1
BERRYING	1
Isn't	1
it	1
funny	1
how	1
two	1
people	1
will	1
often	1
think	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
and	1
neither	1
one	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
other	1
is	1
thinking	1
of	1
it?	1
That	1
is	1
just	1
what	1
happened	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
first	1
thought	1
of	1
going	1
berrying.	1
While	1
he	1
was	1
walking	1
around	1
in	1
the	1
Green	1
Forest,	1
talking	1
to	1
himself	1
about	1
how	1
hungry	1
he	1
was	1
for	1
some	1
berries	1
and	1
how	1
sure	1
he	1
was	1
that	1
there	1
must	1
be	1
some	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
Old	1
Pasture,	1
some	1
one	1
else	1
was	1
thinking	1
about	1
berries	1
and	1
about	1
the	1
Old	1
Pasture	1
too.	1
"Will	1
you	1
make	1
me	1
a	1
berry	1
pie	1
if	1
I	1
will	1
get	1
the	1
berries	1
to-morrow?"	1
asked	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy	1
of	1
his	1
mother.	1
Of	1
course	1
Mrs.	1
Brown	1
promised	1
that	1
she	1
would,	1
and	1
so	1
that	1
night	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy	1
went	1
to	1
bed	1
very	1
early	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
get	1
up	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
all	1
night	1
long	1
he	1
dreamed	1
of	1
berries	1
and	1
berry	1
pies.	1
He	1
was	1
awake	1
even	1
before	1
jolly,	1
round,	1
red	1
Mr.	1
Sun	1
thought	1
it	1
was	1
time	1
to	1
get	1
up,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
all	1
ready	1
to	1
start	1
for	1
the	1
Old	1
Pasture	1
when	1
the	1
first	1
Jolly	1
Little	1
Sunbeams	1
came	1
dancing	1
across	1
the	1
Green	1
Meadows.	1
He	1
carried	1
a	1
big	1
tin	1
pail,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
it,	1
wrapped	1
up	1
in	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
paper,	1
was	1
a	1
lunch,	1
for	1
he	1
meant	1
to	1
stay	1
until	1
he	1
filled	1
that	1
pail,	1
if	1
it	1
took	1
all	1
day.	1
Now	1
the	1
Old	1
Pasture	1
is	1
very	1
large.	1
It	1
lies	1
at	1
the	1
foot	1
of	1
the	1
Big	1
Mountain,	1
and	1
even	1
extends	1
a	1
little	1
way	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
Big	1
Mountain.	1
There	1
is	1
room	1
in	1
it	1
for	1
many	1
people	1
to	1
pick	1
berries	1
all	1
day	1
without	1
even	1
seeing	1
each	1
other,	1
unless	1
they	1
roam	1
about	1
a	1
great	1
deal.	1
You	1
see,	1
the	1
bushes	1
grow	1
very	1
thick	1
there,	1
and	1
you	1
cannot	1
see	1
very	1
far	1
in	1
any	1
direction.	1
Jolly,	1
round,	1
red	1
Mr.	1
Sun	1
had	1
climbed	1
a	1
little	1
way	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
sky	1
by	1
the	1
time	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy	1
reached	1
the	1
Old	1
Pasture,	1
and	1
was	1
smiling	1
down	1
on	1
all	1
the	1
Great	1
World,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
Great	1
World	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
smiling	1
back.	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy	1
started	1
to	1
whistle,	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
stopped.	1
"If	1
I	1
whistle,"	1
thought	1
he,	1
"everybody	1
will	1
know	1
just	1
where	1
I	1
am,	1
and	1
will	1
keep	1
out	1
of	1
sight,	1
and	1
I	1
never	1
can	1
get	1
acquainted	1
with	1
folks	1
if	1
they	1
keep	1
out	1
of	1
sight."	1
You	1
see,	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy	1
was	1
just	1
beginning	1
to	1
understand	1
something	1
that	1
Peter	1
Rabbit	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
little	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
Green	1
Meadows	1
and	1
the	1
Green	1
Forest	1
learned	1
almost	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
learned	1
to	1
walk,--that	1
if	1
you	1
don't	1
want	1
to	1
be	1
seen,	1
you	1
mustn't	1
be	1
heard.	1
So	1
he	1
didn't	1
whistle	1
as	1
he	1
felt	1
like	1
doing,	1
and	1
he	1
tried	1
not	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
noise	1
as	1
he	1
followed	1
an	1
old	1
cow-path	1
towards	1
a	1
place	1
where	1
he	1
knew	1
the	1
berries	1
grew	1
thick	1
and	1
oh,	1
so	1
big,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
he	1
kept	1
his	1
eyes	1
wide	1
open,	1
and	1
he	1
kept	1
his	1
ears	1
open	1
too.	1
That	1
is	1
how	1
he	1
happened	1
to	1
hear	1
a	1
little	1
cry,	1
a	1
very	1
faint	1
little	1
cry.	1
If	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
whistling,	1
he	1
wouldn't	1
have	1
heard	1
it	1
at	1
all.	1
He	1
stopped	1
to	1
listen.	1
He	1
never	1
had	1
heard	1
a	1
cry	1
just	1
like	1
it	1
before.	1
At	1
first	1
he	1
couldn't	1
make	1
out	1
just	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
or	1
where	1
it	1
came	1
from.	1
But	1
one	1
thing	1
he	1
was	1
sure	1
of,	1
and	1
that	1
was	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
cry	1
of	1
fright.	1
He	1
stood	1
perfectly	1
still	1
and	1
listened	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
might.	1
There	1
it	1
was	1
again--"Help!	1
Help!	1
Help"--and	1
it	1
was	1
very	1
faint	1
and	1
sounded	1
terribly	1
frightened.	1
He	1
waited	1
a	1
minute	1
or	1
two,	1
but	1
heard	1
nothing	1
more.	1
Then	1
he	1
put	1
down	1
his	1
pail	1
and	1
began	1
a	1
hurried	1
look	1
here,	1
there,	1
and	1
everywhere.	1
He	1
was	1
sure	1
that	1
it	1
had	1
come	1
from	1
somewhere	1
on	1
the	1
ground,	1
so	1
he	1
peered	1
behind	1
bushes	1
and	1
peeped	1
behind	1
logs	1
and	1
stones,	1
and	1
then	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
about	1
given	1
up	1
hope	1
of	1
finding	1
where	1
it	1
came	1
from,	1
he	1
went	1
around	1
a	1
little	1
turn	1
in	1
the	1
old	1
cow-path,	1
and	1
there	1
right	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
him	1
was	1
little	1
Mr.	1
Gartersnake,	1
and	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
he	1
was	1
doing?	1
Well,	1
I	1
don't	1
like	1
to	1
tell	1
you,	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
trying	1
to	1
swallow	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Stickytoes	1
the	1
Tree	1
Toad.	1
Of	1
course	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
Boy	1
didn't	1
let	1
him.	1
He	1
made	1
little	1
Mr.	1
Gartersnake	1
set	1
Master	1
Stickytoes	1
free	1
and	1
held	1
Mr.	1
Gartersnake	1
until	1
Master	1
Stickytoes	1
was	1
safely	1
out	1
of	1
reach.	1
XIX	1
BUSTER	1
BEAR	1
HAS	1
A	1
FINE	1
TIME	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
was	1
having	1
the	1
finest	1
time	1
he	1
had	1
had	1
since	1
he	1
came	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
Great	1
Woods	1
to	1
live	1
in	1
the	1
Green	1
Forest.	1
To	1
be	1
sure,	1
he	1
wasn't	1
in	1
the	1
Green	1
Forest	1
now,	1
but	1
he	1
wasn't	1
far	1
from	1
it.	1
He	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
Old	1
Pasture,	1
one	1
edge	1
of	1
which	1
touches	1
one	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
Green	1
Forest.	1
And	1
where	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
he	1
was,	1
in	1
the	1
Old	1
Pasture?	1
Why,	1
right	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
biggest	1
patch	1
of	1
the	1
biggest	1
blueberries	1
he	1
ever	1
had	1
seen	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
life!	1
Now	1
if	1
there	1
is	1
any	1
one	1
thing	1
that	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
had	1
rather	1
have	1
above	1
another,	1
it	1
is	1
all	1
the	1
berries	1
he	1
can	1
eat,	1
unless	1
it	1
be	1
honey.	1
Nothing	1
can	1
quite	1
equal	1
honey	1
in	1
Buster's	1
mind.	1
But	1
next	1
to	1
honey	1
give	1
him	1
berries.	1
He	1
isn't	1
particular	1
what	1
kind	1
of	1
berries.	1
Raspberries,	1
blackberries,	1
or	1
blueberries,	1
either	1
kind,	1
will	1
make	1
him	1
perfectly	1
happy.	1
"Um-m-m,	1
my,	1
my,	1
but	1
these	1
are	1
good!"	1
he	1
mumbled	1
in	1
his	1
deep	1
grumbly-rumbly	1
voice,	1
as	1
he	1
sat	1
on	1
his	1
haunches	1
stripping	1
off	1
the	1
berries	1
greedily.	1
His	1
little	1
eyes	1
twinkled	1
with	1
enjoyment,	1
and	1
he	1
didn't	1
mind	1
at	1
all	1
if	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
got	1
leaves,	1
and	1
some	1
green	1
berries	1
in	1
his	1
mouth	1
with	1
the	1
big	1
ripe	1
berries.	1
He	1
didn't	1
try	1
to	1
get	1
them	1
out.	1
Oh,	1
my,	1
no!	1
He	1
just	1
chomped	1
them	1
all	1
up	1
together	1
and	1
patted	1
his	1
stomach	1
from	1
sheer	1
delight.	1
Now	1
Buster	1
had	1
reached	1
the	1
Old	1
Pasture	1
just	1
as	1
jolly,	1
round,	1
red	1
Mr.	1
Sun	1
had	1
crept	1
out	1
of	1
bed,	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
fully	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
back	1
in	1
the	1
Green	1
Forest	1
before	1
Mr.	1
Sun	1
had	1
climbed	1
very	1
far	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
blue,	1
blue	1
sky.	1
You	1
see,	1
big	1
as	1
he	1
is	1
and	1
strong	1
as	1
he	1
is,	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
is	1
very	1
shy	1
and	1
bashful,	1
and	1
he	1
has	1
no	1
desire	1
to	1
meet	1
Farmer	1
Brown,	1
or	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy,	1
or	1
any	1
other	1
of	1
those	1
two-legged	1
creatures	1
called	1
men.	1
It	1
seems	1
funny	1
but	1
he	1
actually	1
is	1
afraid	1
of	1
them.	1
And	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
feeling	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
more	1
likely	1
to	1
meet	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
Old	1
Pasture	1
than	1
deep	1
in	1
the	1
Green	1
Forest.	1
So	1
when	1
he	1
started	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
berries,	1
he	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
eat	1
what	1
he	1
could	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
hurry	1
and	1
get	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
Green	1
Forest	1
before	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy	1
was	1
more	1
than	1
out	1
of	1
bed.	1
But	1
when	1
he	1
found	1
those	1
berries	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
hungry	1
that	1
he	1
forgot	1
his	1
fears	1
and	1
everything	1
else.	1
They	1
tasted	1
so	1
good	1
that	1
he	1
just	1
had	1
to	1
eat	1
and	1
eat	1
and	1
eat.	1
Now	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
Buster	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
big	1
fellow,	1
and	1
it	1
takes	1
a	1
lot	1
to	1
fill	1
him	1
up.	1
He	1
kept	1
eating	1
and	1
eating	1
and	1
eating,	1
and	1
the	1
more	1
he	1
ate	1
the	1
more	1
he	1
wanted.	1
You	1
know	1
how	1
it	1
is.	1
So	1
he	1
wandered	1
from	1
one	1
patch	1
of	1
berries	1
to	1
another	1
in	1
the	1
Old	1
Pasture,	1
and	1
never	1
once	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
time.	1
Somehow,	1
time	1
is	1
the	1
hardest	1
thing	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
remember,	1
when	1
you	1
are	1
having	1
a	1
good	1
time.	1
Jolly,	1
round,	1
red	1
Mr.	1
Sun	1
climbed	1
higher	1
and	1
higher	1
in	1
the	1
blue,	1
blue	1
sky.	1
He	1
looked	1
down	1
on	1
all	1
the	1
Great	1
World	1
and	1
saw	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
going	1
on.	1
He	1
saw	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
in	1
the	1
Old	1
Pasture,	1
and	1
smiled	1
as	1
he	1
saw	1
what	1
a	1
perfectly	1
glorious	1
time	1
Buster	1
was	1
having.	1
And	1
he	1
saw	1
something	1
else	1
in	1
the	1
Old	1
Pasture	1
that	1
made	1
his	1
smile	1
still	1
broader.	1
He	1
saw	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy	1
filling	1
a	1
great	1
tin	1
pail	1
with	1
blueberries,	1
and	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy	1
didn't	1
know	1
that	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
was	1
anywhere	1
about,	1
and	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
didn't	1
know	1
that	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy	1
was	1
anywhere	1
about,	1
and	1
somehow	1
he	1
felt	1
very	1
sure	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
see	1
something	1
funny	1
happen	1
if	1
they	1
should	1
chance	1
to	1
meet.	1
"Um-m-m,	1
um-m-m,"	1
mumbled	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
with	1
his	1
mouth	1
full,	1
as	1
he	1
moved	1
along	1
to	1
another	1
patch	1
of	1
berries.	1
And	1
then	1
he	1
gave	1
a	1
little	1
gasp	1
of	1
surprise	1
and	1
delight.	1
Right	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
him	1
was	1
a	1
shiny	1
thing	1
just	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
finest,	1
biggest,	1
bluest	1
berries!	1
There	1
were	1
no	1
leaves	1
or	1
green	1
ones	1
there.	1
Buster	1
blinked	1
his	1
greedy	1
little	1
eyes	1
rapidly	1
and	1
looked	1
again.	1
No,	1
he	1
wasn't	1
dreaming.	1
They	1
were	1
real	1
berries,	1
and	1
all	1
he	1
had	1
got	1
to	1
do	1
was	1
to	1
help	1
himself.	1
Buster	1
looked	1
sharply	1
at	1
the	1
shiny	1
thing	1
that	1
held	1
the	1
berries.	1
It	1
seemed	1
perfectly	1
harmless.	1
He	1
reached	1
out	1
a	1
big	1
paw	1
and	1
pushed	1
it	1
gently.	1
It	1
tipped	1
over	1
and	1
spilled	1
out	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
the	1
berries.	1
Yes,	1
it	1
was	1
perfectly	1
harmless.	1
Buster	1
gave	1
a	1
little	1
sigh	1
of	1
pure	1
happiness.	1
He	1
would	1
eat	1
those	1
berries	1
to	1
the	1
last	1
one,	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
would	1
go	1
home	1
to	1
the	1
Green	1
Forest.	1
XX	1
BUSTER	1
BEAR	1
CARRIES	1
OFF	1
THE	1
PAIL	1
OF	1
FARMER	1
BROWN'S	1
BOY	1
The	1
question	1
is,	1
did	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
steal	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy's	1
pail?	1
To	1
steal	1
is	1
to	1
take	1
something	1
which	1
belongs	1
to	1
some	1
one	1
else.	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
doubt	1
that	1
he	1
stole	1
the	1
berries	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
pail	1
when	1
he	1
found	1
it,	1
for	1
he	1
deliberately	1
ate	1
them.	1
He	1
knew	1
well	1
enough	1
that	1
some	1
one	1
must	1
have	1
picked	1
them--for	1
whoever	1
heard	1
of	1
blueberries	1
growing	1
in	1
tin	1
pails?	1
So	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
doubt	1
that	1
when	1
Buster	1
took	1
them,	1
he	1
stole	1
them.	1
But	1
with	1
the	1
pail	1
it	1
was	1
different.	1
He	1
took	1
the	1
pail,	1
but	1
he	1
didn't	1
mean	1
to	1
take	1
it.	1
In	1
fact,	1
he	1
didn't	1
want	1
that	1
pail	1
at	1
all.	1
You	1
see	1
it	1
was	1
this	1
way:	1
When	1
Buster	1
found	1
that	1
big	1
tin	1
pail	1
brimming	1
full	1
of	1
delicious	1
berries	1
in	1
the	1
shade	1
of	1
that	1
big	1
bush	1
in	1
the	1
Old	1
Pasture,	1
he	1
didn't	1
stop	1
to	1
think	1
whether	1
or	1
not	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
right	1
to	1
them.	1
Buster	1
is	1
so	1
fond	1
of	1
berries	1
that	1
from	1
the	1
very	1
second	1
that	1
his	1
greedy	1
little	1
eyes	1
saw	1
that	1
pailful,	1
he	1
forgot	1
everything	1
but	1
the	1
feast	1
that	1
was	1
waiting	1
for	1
him	1
right	1
under	1
his	1
very	1
nose.	1
He	1
didn't	1
think	1
anything	1
about	1
the	1
right	1
or	1
wrong	1
of	1
helping	1
himself.	1
There	1
before	1
him	1
were	1
more	1
berries	1
than	1
he	1
had	1
ever	1
seen	1
together	1
at	1
one	1
time	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
life,	1
and	1
all	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
do	1
was	1
to	1
eat	1
and	1
eat	1
and	1
eat.	1
And	1
that	1
is	1
just	1
what	1
he	1
did	1
do.	1
Of	1
course	1
he	1
upset	1
the	1
pail,	1
but	1
he	1
didn't	1
mind	1
a	1
little	1
thing	1
like	1
that.	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
gobbled	1
up	1
all	1
the	1
berries	1
that	1
rolled	1
out,	1
he	1
thrust	1
his	1
nose	1
into	1
the	1
pail	1
to	1
get	1
all	1
that	1
were	1
left	1
in	1
it.	1
Just	1
then	1
he	1
heard	1
a	1
little	1
noise,	1
as	1
if	1
some	1
one	1
were	1
coming.	1
He	1
threw	1
up	1
his	1
head	1
to	1
listen,	1
and	1
somehow,	1
he	1
never	1
did	1
know	1
just	1
how,	1
the	1
handle	1
of	1
the	1
pail	1
slipped	1
back	1
over	1
his	1
ears	1
and	1
caught	1
there.	1
This	1
was	1
bad	1
enough,	1
but	1
to	1
make	1
matters	1
worse,	1
just	1
at	1
that	1
very	1
minute	1
he	1
heard	1
a	1
shrill,	1
angry	1
voice	1
shout,	1
"Hi,	1
there!	1
Get	1
out	1
of	1
there!"	1
He	1
didn't	1
need	1
to	1
be	1
told	1
whose	1
voice	1
that	1
was.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy.	1
Right	1
then	1
and	1
there	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
nearly	1
had	1
a	1
fit.	1
There	1
was	1
that	1
awful	1
pail	1
fast	1
over	1
his	1
head	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
couldn't	1
see	1
a	1
thing.	1
Of	1
course,	1
that	1
meant	1
that	1
he	1
couldn't	1
run	1
away,	1
which	1
was	1
the	1
thing	1
of	1
all	1
things	1
he	1
most	1
wanted	1
to	1
do,	1
for	1
big	1
as	1
he	1
is	1
and	1
strong	1
as	1
he	1
is,	1
Buster	1
is	1
very	1
shy	1
and	1
bashful	1
when	1
human	1
beings	1
are	1
around.	1
He	1
growled	1
and	1
whined	1
and	1
squealed.	1
He	1
tried	1
to	1
back	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
pail	1
and	1
couldn't.	1
He	1
tried	1
to	1
shake	1
it	1
off	1
and	1
couldn't.	1
He	1
tried	1
to	1
pull	1
it	1
off,	1
but	1
somehow	1
he	1
couldn't	1
get	1
hold	1
of	1
it.	1
Then	1
there	1
was	1
another	1
yell.	1
If	1
Buster	1
hadn't	1
been	1
so	1
frightened	1
himself,	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
recognized	1
that	1
second	1
yell	1
as	1
one	1
of	1
fright,	1
for	1
that	1
is	1
what	1
it	1
was.	1
You	1
see	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy	1
had	1
just	1
discovered	1
Buster	1
Bear.	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
yelled	1
the	1
first	1
time,	1
he	1
had	1
supposed	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
cattle	1
who	1
live	1
in	1
the	1
Old	1
Pasture	1
all	1
summer,	1
but	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
Buster,	1
he	1
was	1
just	1
as	1
badly	1
frightened	1
as	1
Buster	1
himself.	1
In	1
fact,	1
he	1
was	1
too	1
surprised	1
and	1
frightened	1
even	1
to	1
run.	1
After	1
that	1
second	1
yell	1
he	1
just	1
stood	1
still	1
and	1
stared.	1
Buster	1
clawed	1
at	1
that	1
awful	1
thing	1
on	1
his	1
head	1
more	1
frantically	1
than	1
ever.	1
Suddenly	1
it	1
slipped	1
off,	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
see.	1
He	1
gave	1
one	1
frightened	1
look	1
at	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy,	1
and	1
then	1
with	1
a	1
mighty	1
"Woof!"	1
he	1
started	1
for	1
the	1
Green	1
Forest	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
his	1
legs	1
could	1
take	1
him,	1
and	1
this	1
was	1
very	1
fast	1
indeed,	1
let	1
me	1
tell	1
you.	1
He	1
didn't	1
stop	1
to	1
pick	1
out	1
a	1
path,	1
but	1
just	1
crashed	1
through	1
the	1
bushes	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
nothing	1
at	1
all,	1
just	1
nothing	1
at	1
all.	1
But	1
the	1
funniest	1
thing	1
of	1
all	1
is	1
this--he	1
took	1
that	1
pail	1
with	1
him!	1
Yes,	1
Sir,	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
ran	1
away	1
with	1
the	1
big	1
tin	1
pail	1
of	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy!	1
You	1
see	1
when	1
it	1
slipped	1
off	1
his	1
head,	1
the	1
handle	1
was	1
still	1
around	1
his	1
neck,	1
and	1
there	1
he	1
was	1
running	1
away	1
with	1
a	1
pail	1
hanging	1
from	1
his	1
neck!	1
He	1
didn't	1
want	1
it.	1
He	1
would	1
have	1
given	1
anything	1
to	1
get	1
rid	1
of	1
it.	1
But	1
he	1
took	1
it	1
because	1
he	1
couldn't	1
help	1
it.	1
And	1
that	1
brings	1
us	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
question,	1
did	1
Buster	1
steal	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy's	1
pail?	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
think?	1

SAMMY	1
JAY	1
MAKES	1
THINGS	1
WORSE	1
FOR	1
BUSTER	1
BEAR	1
"Thief,	1
thief,	1
thief!	1
Thief,	1
thief,	1
thief!"	1
Sammy	1
Jay	1
was	1
screaming	1
at	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
his	1
lungs,	1
as	1
he	1
followed	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
across	1
the	1
Old	1
Pasture	1
towards	1
the	1
Green	1
Forest.	1
Never	1
had	1
he	1
screamed	1
so	1
loud,	1
and	1
never	1
had	1
his	1
voice	1
sounded	1
so	1
excited.	1
The	1
little	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
Green	1
Forest,	1
the	1
Green	1
Meadows,	1
and	1
the	1
Smiling	1
Pool	1
are	1
so	1
used	1
to	1
hearing	1
Sammy	1
cry	1
thief	1
that	1
usually	1
they	1
think	1
very	1
little	1
about	1
it.	1
But	1
every	1
blessed	1
one	1
who	1
heard	1
Sammy	1
this	1
morning	1
stopped	1
whatever	1
he	1
was	1
doing	1
and	1
pricked	1
up	1
his	1
ears	1
to	1
listen.	1
Sammy's	1
cousin,	1
Blacky	1
the	1
Crow,	1
just	1
happened	1
to	1
be	1
flying	1
along	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
Old	1
Pasture,	1
and	1
the	1
minute	1
he	1
heard	1
Sammy's	1
voice,	1
he	1
turned	1
and	1
flew	1
over	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
about.	1
Just	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
caught	1
sight	1
of	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
running	1
for	1
the	1
Green	1
Forest	1
as	1
hard	1
as	1
ever	1
he	1
could,	1
he	1
understood	1
what	1
had	1
excited	1
Sammy	1
so.	1
He	1
was	1
so	1
surprised	1
that	1
he	1
almost	1
forgot	1
to	1
keep	1
his	1
wings	1
moving.	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
had	1
what	1
looked	1
to	1
Blacky	1
very	1
much	1
like	1
a	1
tin	1
pail	1
hanging	1
from	1
his	1
neck!	1
No	1
wonder	1
Sammy	1
was	1
excited.	1
Blacky	1
beat	1
his	1
wings	1
fiercely	1
and	1
started	1
after	1
Sammy.	1
And	1
so	1
they	1
reached	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
Green	1
Forest,	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
running	1
as	1
hard	1
as	1
ever	1
he	1
could,	1
Sammy	1
Jay	1
flying	1
just	1
behind	1
him	1
and	1
screaming,	1
"Thief,	1
thief,	1
thief!"	1
at	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
his	1
lungs,	1
and	1
behind	1
him	1
Blacky	1
the	1
Crow,	1
trying	1
to	1
catch	1
up	1
and	1
yelling	1
as	1
loud	1
as	1
he	1
could,	1
"Caw,	1
caw,	1
caw!	1
Come	1
on,	1
everybody!	1
Come	1
on!	1
Come	1
on!"	1
Poor	1
Buster!	1
It	1
was	1
bad	1
enough	1
to	1
be	1
frightened	1
almost	1
to	1
death	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
Old	1
Pasture	1
when	1
the	1
pail	1
had	1
caught	1
over	1
his	1
head	1
just	1
as	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy	1
had	1
yelled	1
at	1
him.	1
Then	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
handle	1
of	1
the	1
pail	1
slip	1
down	1
around	1
his	1
neck	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
couldn't	1
get	1
rid	1
of	1
the	1
pail	1
but	1
had	1
to	1
take	1
it	1
with	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
ran,	1
was	1
making	1
a	1
bad	1
matter	1
worse.	1
Now	1
to	1
have	1
all	1
his	1
neighbors	1
of	1
the	1
Green	1
Forest	1
see	1
him	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
fix	1
and	1
make	1
fun	1
of	1
him,	1
was	1
more	1
than	1
he	1
could	1
stand.	1
He	1
felt	1
humiliated.	1
That	1
is	1
just	1
another	1
way	1
of	1
saying	1
shamed.	1
Yes,	1
Sir,	1
Buster	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
shamed	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
his	1
neighbors,	1
and	1
he	1
wanted	1
nothing	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
to	1
get	1
away	1
by	1
himself,	1
where	1
no	1
one	1
could	1
see	1
him,	1
and	1
try	1
to	1
get	1
rid	1
of	1
that	1
dreadful	1
pail.	1
But	1
Buster	1
is	1
so	1
big	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
easy	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
find	1
a	1
hiding	1
place.	1
So,	1
when	1
he	1
reached	1
the	1
Green	1
Forest,	1
he	1
kept	1
right	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
deepest,	1
darkest,	1
most	1
lonesome	1
part	1
and	1
crept	1
under	1
the	1
thickest	1
hemlock-tree	1
he	1
could	1
find.	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
of	1
no	1
use.	1
The	1
sharp	1
eyes	1
of	1
Sammy	1
Jay	1
and	1
Blacky	1
the	1
Crow	1
saw	1
him.	1
They	1
actually	1
flew	1
into	1
the	1
very	1
tree	1
under	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
hiding,	1
and	1
how	1
they	1
did	1
scream!	1
Pretty	1
soon	1
Ol'	1
Mistah	1
Buzzard	1
came	1
dropping	1
down	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
blue,	1
blue	1
sky	1
and	1
took	1
a	1
seat	1
on	1
a	1
convenient	1
dead	1
tree,	1
where	1
he	1
could	1
see	1
all	1
that	1
went	1
on.	1
Ol'	1
Mistah	1
Buzzard	1
began	1
to	1
grin	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
tin	1
pail	1
on	1
Buster's	1
neck.	1
Then	1
came	1
others,--Redtail	1
the	1
Hawk,	1
Scrapper	1
the	1
Kingbird,	1
Redwing	1
the	1
Blackbird,	1
Drummer	1
the	1
Woodpecker,	1
Welcome	1
Robin,	1
Tommy	1
Tit	1
the	1
Chickadee,	1
Jenny	1
Wren,	1
Redeye	1
the	1
Vireo,	1
and	1
ever	1
so	1
many	1
more.	1
They	1
came	1
from	1
the	1
Old	1
Orchard,	1
the	1
Green	1
Meadows,	1
and	1
even	1
down	1
by	1
the	1
Smiling	1
Pool,	1
for	1
the	1
voices	1
of	1
Sammy	1
Jay	1
and	1
Blacky	1
the	1
Crow	1
carried	1
far,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
them	1
everybody	1
hurried	1
over,	1
sure	1
that	1
something	1
exciting	1
was	1
going	1
on.	1
Presently	1
Buster	1
heard	1
light	1
footsteps,	1
and	1
peeping	1
out,	1
he	1
saw	1
Billy	1
Mink	1
and	1
Peter	1
Rabbit	1
and	1
Jumper	1
the	1
Hare	1
and	1
Prickly	1
Porky	1
and	1
Reddy	1
Fox	1
and	1
Jimmy	1
Skunk.	1
Even	1
timid	1
little	1
Whitefoot	1
the	1
Wood	1
Mouse	1
was	1
where	1
he	1
could	1
peer	1
out	1
and	1
see	1
without	1
being	1
seen.	1
Of	1
course,	1
Chatterer	1
the	1
Red	1
Squirrel	1
and	1
Happy	1
Jack	1
the	1
Gray	1
Squirrel	1
were	1
there.	1
There	1
they	1
all	1
sat	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
circle	1
around	1
him,	1
each	1
where	1
he	1
felt	1
safe,	1
but	1
where	1
he	1
could	1
see,	1
and	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
laughing	1
and	1
making	1
fun	1
of	1
Buster.	1
"Thief,	1
thief,	1
thief!"	1
screamed	1
Sammy	1
until	1
his	1
throat	1
was	1
sore.	1
The	1
worst	1
of	1
it	1
was	1
Buster	1
knew	1
that	1
everybody	1
knew	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
true.	1
That	1
awful	1
pail	1
was	1
proof	1
of	1
it.	1
"I	1
wish	1
I	1
never	1
had	1
thought	1
of	1
berries,"	1
growled	1
Buster	1
to	1
himself.	1
XXII	1
BUSTER	1
BEAR	1
HAS	1
A	1
FIT	1
OF	1
TEMPER	1
A	1
temper	1
is	1
a	1
bad,	1
bad	1
thing	1
When	1
once	1
it	1
gets	1
away.	1
There's	1
nothing	1
quite	1
at	1
all	1
like	1
it	1
To	1
spoil	1
a	1
pleasant	1
day.	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
terrible	1
temper.	1
Yes,	1
Sir,	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
was	1
having	1
the	1
worst	1
fit	1
of	1
temper	1
ever	1
seen	1
in	1
the	1
Green	1
Forest.	1
And	1
the	1
worst	1
part	1
of	1
it	1
all	1
was	1
that	1
all	1
his	1
neighbors	1
of	1
the	1
Green	1
Forest	1
and	1
a	1
whole	1
lot	1
from	1
the	1
Green	1
Meadows	1
and	1
the	1
Smiling	1
Pool	1
were	1
also	1
there	1
to	1
see	1
it.	1
It	1
is	1
bad	1
enough	1
to	1
give	1
way	1
to	1
temper	1
when	1
you	1
are	1
all	1
alone,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
watch	1
you,	1
but	1
when	1
you	1
let	1
temper	1
get	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
you	1
right	1
where	1
others	1
see	1
you,	1
oh,	1
dear,	1
dear,	1
it	1
certainly	1
is	1
a	1
sorry	1
sight.	1
Now	1
ordinarily	1
Buster	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
good-natured	1
persons	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
It	1
takes	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
to	1
rouse	1
his	1
temper.	1
He	1
isn't	1
one	1
tenth	1
so	1
quick	1
tempered	1
as	1
Chatterer	1
the	1
Red	1
Squirrel,	1
or	1
Sammy	1
Jay,	1
or	1
Reddy	1
Fox.	1
But	1
when	1
his	1
temper	1
is	1
aroused	1
and	1
gets	1
away	1
from	1
him,	1
then	1
watch	1
out!	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
Buster	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
had	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
stand	1
that	1
day	1
and	1
a	1
little	1
more.	1
First	1
had	1
come	1
the	1
fright	1
back	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
Old	1
Pasture.	1
Then	1
the	1
pail	1
had	1
slipped	1
down	1
behind	1
his	1
ears	1
and	1
held	1
fast,	1
so	1
he	1
had	1
run	1
all	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
Green	1
Forest	1
with	1
it	1
hanging	1
about	1
his	1
neck.	1
This	1
was	1
bad	1
enough,	1
for	1
he	1
knew	1
just	1
how	1
funny	1
he	1
must	1
look,	1
and	1
besides,	1
it	1
was	1
very	1
uncomfortable.	1
But	1
to	1
have	1
Sammy	1
Jay	1
call	1
everybody	1
within	1
hearing	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
see	1
him	1
was	1
more	1
than	1
he	1
could	1
stand.	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
Buster	1
as	1
if	1
everybody	1
who	1
lives	1
in	1
the	1
Green	1
Forest,	1
on	1
the	1
Green	1
Meadows,	1
or	1
around	1
the	1
Smiling	1
Brook,	1
was	1
sitting	1
around	1
his	1
hiding	1
place,	1
laughing	1
and	1
making	1
fun	1
of	1
him.	1
It	1
was	1
more	1
than	1
any	1
self-respecting	1
Bear	1
could	1
stand.	1
With	1
a	1
roar	1
of	1
anger	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
charged	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
hiding	1
place.	1
He	1
rushed	1
this	1
way	1
and	1
that	1
way!	1
He	1
roared	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
might!	1
He	1
was	1
very	1
terrible	1
to	1
see.	1
Those	1
who	1
could	1
fly,	1
flew.	1
Those	1
who	1
could	1
climb,	1
climbed.	1
And	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
swift	1
of	1
foot,	1
ran.	1
A	1
few	1
who	1
could	1
neither	1
fly	1
nor	1
climb	1
nor	1
run	1
fast,	1
hid	1
and	1
lay	1
shaking	1
and	1
trembling	1
for	1
fear	1
that	1
Buster	1
would	1
find	1
them.	1
In	1
less	1
time	1
than	1
it	1
takes	1
to	1
tell	1
about	1
it,	1
Buster	1
was	1
alone.	1
At	1
least,	1
he	1
couldn't	1
see	1
any	1
one.	1
[Illustration:	1

who	1

flew.	1
Those	1

_Page	1
112._]	1
Then	1
he	1
vented	1
his	1
temper	1
on	1
the	1
tin	1
pail.	1
He	1
cuffed	1
at	1
it	1
and	1
pulled	1
at	1
it,	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
growling	1
angrily.	1
He	1
lay	1
down	1
and	1
clawed	1
at	1
it	1
with	1
his	1
hind	1
feet.	1
At	1
last	1
the	1
handle	1
broke,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
free!	1
He	1
shook	1
himself.	1
Then	1
he	1
jumped	1
on	1
the	1
helpless	1
pail.	1
With	1
a	1
blow	1
of	1
a	1
big	1
paw	1
he	1
sent	1
it	1
clattering	1
against	1
a	1
tree.	1
He	1
tried	1
to	1
bite	1
it.	1
Then	1
he	1
once	1
more	1
fell	1
to	1
knocking	1
it	1
this	1
way	1
and	1
that	1
way,	1
until	1
it	1
was	1
pounded	1
flat,	1
and	1
no	1
one	1
would	1
ever	1
have	1
guessed	1
that	1
it	1
had	1
once	1
been	1
a	1
pail.	1
Then,	1
and	1
not	1
till	1
then,	1
did	1
Buster	1
recover	1
his	1
usual	1
good	1
nature.	1
Little	1
by	1
little,	1
as	1
he	1
thought	1
it	1
all	1
over,	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
shame	1
crept	1
into	1
his	1
face.	1
"I--I	1
guess	1
it	1
wasn't	1
the	1
fault	1
of	1
that	1
thing.	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
known	1
enough	1
to	1
keep	1
my	1
head	1
out	1
of	1
it,"	1
he	1
said	1
slowly	1
and	1
thoughtfully.	1
"You	1
got	1
no	1
more	1
than	1
you	1
deserve	1
for	1
stealing	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy's	1
berries,"	1
said	1
Sammy	1
Jay,	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
back	1
and	1
was	1
looking	1
on	1
from	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
a	1
tree.	1
"You	1
ought	1
to	1
know	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
that	1
no	1
good	1
comes	1
of	1
stealing."	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
looked	1
up	1
and	1
grinned,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
twinkle	1
in	1
his	1
eyes.	1
"You	1
ought	1
to	1
know,	1
Sammy	1
Jay,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"I	1
hope	1
you'll	1
always	1
remember	1
it."	1
"Thief,	1
thief,	1
thief!"	1
screamed	1
Sammy,	1
and	1
flew	1
away.	1

FARMER	1
BROWN'S	1
BOY	1
LUNCHES	1
ON	1
BERRIES	1
When	1
things	1
go	1
wrong	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
you	1
To	1
smile's	1
the	1
best	1
thing	1
you	1
can	1
do--	1
To	1
smile	1
and	1
say,	1
"I'm	1
mighty	1
glad	1
They	1
are	1
no	1
worse;	1
they're	1
not	1
so	1
bad!"	1
That	1
is	1
what	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy	1
said	1
when	1
he	1
found	1
that	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
had	1
stolen	1
the	1
berries	1
he	1
had	1
worked	1
so	1
hard	1
to	1
pick	1
and	1
then	1
had	1
run	1
off	1
with	1
the	1
pail.	1
You	1
see,	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy	1
is	1
learning	1
to	1
be	1
something	1
of	1
a	1
philosopher,	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
people	1
who	1
accept	1
bad	1
things	1
cheerfully	1
and	1
right	1
away	1
see	1
how	1
they	1
are	1
better	1
than	1
they	1
might	1
have	1
been.	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
first	1
heard	1
some	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
bushes	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
hidden	1
his	1
pail	1
of	1
berries,	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
very	1
sure	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
cows	1
or	1
young	1
cattle	1
who	1
live	1
in	1
the	1
Old	1
Pasture	1
during	1
the	1
summer.	1
He	1
had	1
been	1
afraid	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
stupidly	1
kick	1
over	1
the	1
pail	1
and	1
spill	1
the	1
berries,	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
hurried	1
to	1
drive	1
whoever	1
it	1
was	1
away.	1
It	1
hadn't	1
entered	1
his	1
head	1
that	1
it	1
could	1
be	1
anybody	1
who	1
would	1
eat	1
those	1
berries.	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
yelled	1
and	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
had	1
suddenly	1
appeared,	1
struggling	1
to	1
get	1
off	1
the	1
pail	1
which	1
had	1
caught	1
over	1
his	1
head,	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy	1
had	1
been	1
too	1
frightened	1
to	1
even	1
move.	1
Then	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
Buster	1
tear	1
away	1
through	1
the	1
brush	1
even	1
more	1
frightened	1
than	1
he	1
was,	1
and	1
right	1
away	1
his	1
courage	1
had	1
begun	1
to	1
come	1
back.	1
"If	1
he	1
is	1
so	1
afraid	1
of	1
me,	1
I	1
guess	1
I	1
needn't	1
be	1
afraid	1
of	1
him,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"I've	1
lost	1
my	1
berries,	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
worth	1
it	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
afraid	1
of	1
me.	1
There	1
are	1
plenty	1
more	1
on	1
the	1
bushes,	1
and	1
all	1
I've	1
got	1
to	1
do	1
is	1
to	1
pick	1
them.	1
It	1
might	1
be	1
worse."	1
He	1
walked	1
over	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
the	1
pail	1
had	1
been,	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
remembered	1
that	1
when	1
Buster	1
ran	1
away	1
he	1
had	1
carried	1
the	1
pail	1
with	1
him,	1
hanging	1
about	1
his	1
neck.	1
He	1
whistled.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
comical	1
little	1
whistle	1
of	1
chagrin	1
as	1
he	1
realized	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
nothing	1
in	1
which	1
to	1
put	1
more	1
berries,	1
even	1
if	1
he	1
picked	1
them.	1
"It's	1
worse	1
than	1
I	1
thought,"	1
cried	1
he.	1
"That	1
bear	1
has	1
cheated	1
me	1
out	1
of	1
that	1
berry	1
pie	1
my	1
mother	1
promised	1
me."	1
Then	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
laugh,	1
as	1
he	1
thought	1
of	1
how	1
funny	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
had	1
looked	1
with	1
the	1
pail	1
about	1
his	1
neck,	1
and	1
then	1
because,	1
you	1
know	1
he	1
is	1
learning	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
philosopher,	1
he	1
once	1
more	1
repeated,	1
"It	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
worse.	1
Yes,	1
indeed,	1
it	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
worse.	1
That	1
bear	1
might	1
have	1
tried	1
to	1
eat	1
me	1
instead	1
of	1
the	1
berries.	1
I	1
guess	1
I'll	1
go	1
eat	1
that	1
lunch	1
I	1
left	1
back	1
by	1
the	1
spring,	1
and	1
then	1
I'll	1
go	1
home.	1
I	1
can	1
pick	1
berries	1
some	1
other	1
day."	1
Chuckling	1
happily	1
over	1
Buster	1
Bear's	1
great	1
fright,	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy	1
tramped	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
spring	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
two	1
thick	1
sandwiches	1
on	1
a	1
flat	1
stone	1
when	1
he	1
started	1
to	1
save	1
his	1
pail	1
of	1
berries.	1
"My,	1
but	1
those	1
sandwiches	1
will	1
taste	1
good,"	1
thought	1
he.	1
"I'm	1
glad	1
they	1
are	1
big	1
and	1
thick.	1
I	1
never	1
was	1
hungrier	1
in	1
my	1
life.	1
Hello!"	1
This	1
he	1
exclaimed	1
right	1
out	1
loud,	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
just	1
come	1
in	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
flat	1
stone	1
where	1
the	1
sandwiches	1
should	1
have	1
been,	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
there.	1
No,	1
Sir,	1
there	1
wasn't	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
a	1
crumb	1
left	1
of	1
those	1
two	1
thick	1
sandwiches.	1
You	1
see,	1
Old	1
Man	1
Coyote	1
had	1
found	1
them	1
and	1
gobbled	1
them	1
up	1
while	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy	1
was	1
away.	1
But	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy	1
didn't	1
know	1
anything	1
about	1
Old	1
Man	1
Coyote.	1
He	1
rubbed	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
stared	1
everywhere,	1
even	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
trees,	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
thought	1
those	1
sandwiches	1
might	1
be	1
hanging	1
up	1
there.	1
They	1
had	1
disappeared	1
as	1
completely	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
never	1
had	1
been,	1
and	1
Old	1
Man	1
Coyote	1
had	1
taken	1
care	1
to	1
leave	1
no	1
trace	1
of	1
his	1
visit.	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy	1
gaped	1
foolishly	1
this	1
way	1
and	1
that	1
way.	1
Then,	1
instead	1
of	1
growing	1
angry,	1
a	1
slow	1
smile	1
stole	1
over	1
his	1
freckled	1
face.	1
"I	1
guess	1
some	1
one	1
else	1
was	1
hungry	1
too,"	1
he	1
muttered.	1
"Wonder	1
who	1
it	1
was?	1
Guess	1
this	1
Old	1
Pasture	1
is	1
no	1
place	1
for	1
me	1
to-day.	1
I'll	1
fill	1
up	1
on	1
berries	1
and	1
then	1
I'll	1
go	1
home."	1
So	1
Farmer	1
Brown's	1
boy	1
made	1
his	1
lunch	1
on	1
blueberries	1
and	1
then	1
rather	1
sheepishly	1
he	1
started	1
for	1
home	1
to	1
tell	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
strange	1
things	1
that	1
had	1
happened	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
Old	1
Pasture.	1
Two	1
or	1
three	1
times,	1
as	1
he	1
trudged	1
along,	1
he	1
stopped	1
to	1
scratch	1
his	1
head	1
thoughtfully.	1
"I	1
guess,"	1
said	1
he	1
at	1
last,	1
"that	1
I'm	1
not	1
so	1
smart	1
as	1
I	1
thought	1
I	1
was,	1
and	1
I've	1
got	1
a	1
lot	1
to	1
learn	1
yet."	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
adventures	1
of	1
Buster	1
Bear	1
in	1
this	1
book	1
because--guess	1
why.	1
Because	1
Old	1
Mr.	1
Toad	1
insists	1
that	1
I	1
must	1
write	1
a	1
book	1
about	1
his	1
adventures,	1
and	1
Old	1
Mr.	1
Toad	1
is	1
such	1
a	1
good	1
friend	1
of	1
all	1
of	1
us	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
going	1
to	1
do	1
it.	1
